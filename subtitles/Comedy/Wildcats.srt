1
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,644
- Come on.
- I'm sorry.

2
00:02:09,712 --> 00:02:11,907
Yearbooks are forever. Look serious.

3
00:02:11,981 --> 00:02:13,881
- Okay, all right.
- Hold it.

4
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:17,351
Janey, keep your arms down.
Come on. Pump them!

5
00:02:18,188 --> 00:02:19,553
All right, mean.

6
00:02:19,622 --> 00:02:22,989
Tell me I'll coach girls' track
for the rest of my life.

7
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:26,517
Come on, this gag photo
for the yearbook was your idea.

8
00:02:29,532 --> 00:02:32,763
What the hell is going on?
Who let you use my uniform?

9
00:02:32,836 --> 00:02:34,394
- Hi, Dan.
- Moll.

10
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:37,064
Sorry, babe. Didn't know it was you.
No problem.

11
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:40,109
Anytime you wanna get into my pants,
just ask.

12
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:43,443
I never had sisters before. So long.

13
00:02:43,513 --> 00:02:44,707
What a guy.

14
00:02:44,781 --> 00:02:47,716
Come on, girls. Keep your stride
nice and easy. Let's go.

15
00:02:47,784 --> 00:02:49,479
Get your arms down!

16
00:02:49,686 --> 00:02:52,382
Moll, our fearless leader has returned.

17
00:02:52,488 --> 00:02:53,955
- Who?
- Walker.

18
00:02:54,891 --> 00:02:59,089
Go ask him now before somebody
else does. Go get him, tiger!

19
00:03:00,396 --> 00:03:01,761
Dr. Walker!

20
00:03:03,833 --> 00:03:05,300
Miss McGrath!

21
00:03:06,169 --> 00:03:09,070
For a second
I thought you were Bubba Smith.

22
00:03:09,706 --> 00:03:14,006
They look fine. You look fine, girls.
Get those arms up.

23
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:18,913
How was the principals' conference?

24
00:03:20,783 --> 00:03:22,751
- Very stimulating.
- Good.

25
00:03:24,387 --> 00:03:28,289
Dr. Walker, an interesting thing happened
when you were away...

26
00:03:28,524 --> 00:03:31,425
Nick Martinelli went in for a double hernia.

27
00:03:31,494 --> 00:03:35,555
I don't think he's gonna be able
to coach JV football this year...

28
00:03:37,834 --> 00:03:39,631
and I'd like the job.

29
00:03:41,504 --> 00:03:44,962
I tell you what, run it by Dan Darwell.

30
00:03:45,575 --> 00:03:49,443
If he doesn't have any objections,
it's fine with me.

31
00:03:50,013 --> 00:03:52,607
Young lady, keep those knees pumping!

32
00:03:53,616 --> 00:03:55,481
Knees and arms, girls.

33
00:03:56,686 --> 00:03:59,985
- I got to ask Dan.
- The worst he could do is say no.

34
00:04:00,056 --> 00:04:02,047
He could say, "No, babes."

35
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:05,052
You wanna know the best way to do this?

36
00:04:05,128 --> 00:04:07,028
Don't talk to him about it now.

37
00:04:07,096 --> 00:04:10,293
- Not now? I like that.
- Tell him you want to meet him later.

38
00:04:10,366 --> 00:04:12,027
- Later. Good.
- Sort of a date.

39
00:04:12,101 --> 00:04:14,592
I'm not going on a date with him.
I already did.

40
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:16,161
Tell him you want to meet him.

41
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:18,673
Maybe play a game of racquetball.

42
00:04:18,741 --> 00:04:20,709
I mean, the guy is disgusting.

43
00:04:20,777 --> 00:04:24,110
- I'm not going on a date.
- How badly do you wanna coach football?

44
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:27,946
- I can't. I have to pick the kids up.
- I'll pick the kids up.

45
00:04:33,222 --> 00:04:34,712
I'm warmed up.

46
00:04:34,824 --> 00:04:36,655
Okay. Ready?

47
00:04:38,561 --> 00:04:42,190
- I need to talk to you, Dan.
- Sure, babes. How about over dinner?

48
00:04:42,265 --> 00:04:46,827
- How about over racquetball?
- Okay. A quick set, then dinner.

49
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:50,339
We'll play to five. Ladies first. You serve.

50
00:04:55,278 --> 00:04:57,439
I want to coach the JV, Dan.

51
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:04,075
Molly, a girl can't coach boys' football.
You know that.

52
00:05:04,153 --> 00:05:06,053
- No, I don't.
- My serve.

53
00:05:06,589 --> 00:05:09,649
- Dan, I can handle this. Believe me.
- Heads up!

54
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:15,019
One-zip. Supposed to hit the ball,
not the wall, babes.

55
00:05:15,264 --> 00:05:19,894
I was raised on football. I know more
about it than anybody else you could get.

56
00:05:19,969 --> 00:05:22,870
- I mean, coaching to me is like...
- Heads up!

57
00:05:27,643 --> 00:05:32,171
You know I'm qualified, Dan. I've known
you and Dr. Walker a long time now.

58
00:05:32,682 --> 00:05:36,083
You wouldn't discriminate against me
because I'm a woman.

59
00:05:36,819 --> 00:05:39,344
You know me, babes, I'm a modern guy...

60
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:41,947
but Walker, I don't know.
Let's see what he says.

61
00:05:42,025 --> 00:05:44,960
- We'll meet with him on Monday.
- Thanks, Dan.

62
00:05:57,607 --> 00:06:00,007
- What's the score?
- Two-one, mine.

63
00:06:02,512 --> 00:06:04,377
It's three-one, yours.

64
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:22,129
Dan, I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
Are you okay?

65
00:06:22,198 --> 00:06:26,328
I'm fine. Good game. We'll play again
when I don't have a headache.

66
00:06:26,836 --> 00:06:29,202
- See you later.
- You're not sore at me, are you?

67
00:06:29,272 --> 00:06:30,603
No, everything's fine.

68
00:06:30,673 --> 00:06:35,167
- We're still going to meet with Walker?
- Yeah, first thing Monday morning.

69
00:06:37,013 --> 00:06:39,447
- Okay. You're not upset?
- I'm fine.

70
00:06:39,515 --> 00:06:42,211
- Get out of here, you knucklehead.
- Okay.

71
00:06:55,465 --> 00:06:57,729
<i>Yeah. Go team. Throw the ball!</i>

72
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,633
- Mom, I lost my sneaker.
- Put on your sandals.

73
00:07:00,703 --> 00:07:03,763
- Verna, I found Dad's playbooks.
- Then I'm not going.

74
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,137
- Alice!
- What?

75
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:08,041
- Help your sister find her shoe.
- Why do I have to?

76
00:07:08,111 --> 00:07:12,172
Because she's 6. You're 13.
As you get older, life gets tougher.

77
00:07:12,882 --> 00:07:17,410
Look how Dad blocked the sweep series.
He was way ahead of his time.

78
00:07:17,487 --> 00:07:19,114
I love this play.

79
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:25,354
Hey, Mom, I found Marian's shoe.
President Muffley had it.

80
00:07:25,428 --> 00:07:28,295
Little son of a bitch also
ate my Duran Duran album.

81
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:29,626
What'd you say?

82
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:33,999
Verna said it's okay to call a dog
a son of a bitch, because that's what he is.

83
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:37,904
I can't believe I said that,
but it is linguistically correct.

84
00:07:38,741 --> 00:07:40,003
I got it.

85
00:07:44,313 --> 00:07:46,281
- Hey, Frank.
- Hey, Verna.

86
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:48,747
How you doing?

87
00:07:48,818 --> 00:07:51,810
- My lips are above the water line.
- That's very funny.

88
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:54,288
- Hey, Moll. What's happening?
- Hi.

89
00:07:54,624 --> 00:07:58,651
What's with all that? Finally getting
around to throwing that stuff out?

90
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:01,026
Yeah, I'm just throwing that out.

91
00:08:01,097 --> 00:08:02,291
Daddy!

92
00:08:02,365 --> 00:08:05,300
Hi, sweetie. Muffinhead.

93
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:10,432
- Kids!
- We're going shopping!

94
00:08:10,506 --> 00:08:13,339
Guys, call me every night, okay?

95
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:16,439
- It's just the weekend.
- Well, humor me.

96
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:18,244
'Bye, baby.

97
00:08:19,182 --> 00:08:21,776
'Bye, Mom. See you Sunday. I love you.

98
00:08:21,851 --> 00:08:24,479
- 'Bye, honey. I love you. 'Bye.
- 'Bye, Mom.

99
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,884
By the way, Stephanie's parents
are having a cocktail party Sunday night...

100
00:08:28,958 --> 00:08:33,452
so I'll drop the kids off earlier than usual,
like 2:30 p.m. Okay? Thanks.

101
00:08:36,232 --> 00:08:38,427
Why didn't you tell him
about the coaching?

102
00:08:38,501 --> 00:08:41,834
'Cause I know him. He'd put it down,
try to talk me out of it.

103
00:08:41,904 --> 00:08:46,102
So I decided to get tough,
stand up to him, and deny it.

104
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:50,573
Anyway, I'll tell him Monday
after I get the job.

105
00:08:51,013 --> 00:08:52,878
I'm really very sorry.

106
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:56,612
If the position has been filled,
there's nothing I can do about it.

107
00:08:56,819 --> 00:09:01,051
Coach Darwell is within his rights
to select Mr. Remo as his JV Coach.

108
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:04,422
- But he's the Home Ec teacher.
- And a darn good one, too!

109
00:09:04,927 --> 00:09:07,919
Mr. Remo, do you know
what a nickel defense is...

110
00:09:07,997 --> 00:09:11,364
or an open set formation,
or when to use a safety blitz?

111
00:09:12,034 --> 00:09:13,399
I can't say I do.

112
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:17,371
How about penetration? Do you know
how to get good penetration?

113
00:09:18,507 --> 00:09:22,204
Miss McGrath, please.
We're drifting off the subject here.

114
00:09:23,012 --> 00:09:25,344
Sorry I'm late. What did I miss?

115
00:09:25,414 --> 00:09:28,247
Dr. Walker was explaining to me
why you picked someone...

116
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:32,083
no disrespect, Mr. Remo, who
doesn't know diddlysquat about football.

117
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:35,590
Hey, you really wanna coach football?
Fine, you got it.

118
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:38,422
What are you talking about?
You said I could coach JV.

119
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:41,691
Because, she's going to coach varsity.
The big "V."

120
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:43,727
- What?
- Jesus, Dan, don't...

121
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:45,391
At Central High.

122
00:09:46,969 --> 00:09:48,334
Oh, my God.

123
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:52,098
I spoke to their principal this morning.

124
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:56,110
If she is willing to take no bonus
over her pay, they'd love to have her.

125
00:09:57,413 --> 00:09:59,677
Here's his number. Ben Edwards.

126
00:10:01,217 --> 00:10:04,414
Dan, I don't think Central
is the right place for a woman.

127
00:10:04,487 --> 00:10:06,614
She can handle it. Can't you, Moll?

128
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:10,090
Besides, maybe a woman's touch
is just what they need.

129
00:10:10,226 --> 00:10:14,663
After she teaches them to sit,
she can take the thorns out of their paws.

130
00:10:19,402 --> 00:10:22,394
- You think that's real funny, don't you?
- Yes.

131
00:10:25,441 --> 00:10:27,170
Okay, laughing boy.

132
00:10:32,348 --> 00:10:34,407
I'm going to take that job.

133
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:37,413
You think a woman
can't be tough enough?

134
00:10:38,154 --> 00:10:39,917
I'll show you tough.

135
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:41,985
Watch me.

136
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:54,229
I forgot my purse.

137
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:15,442
Help!

138
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:24,224
Mr. Edwards?

139
00:12:31,801 --> 00:12:35,066
Hey, come on, stop all that noise.
You damned dogs.

140
00:12:38,808 --> 00:12:40,776
- Hey, how are you?
- Fine.

141
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:43,603
I bet you're Molly McGrath.

142
00:12:44,113 --> 00:12:46,274
- Ben Edwards.
- Molly McGrath.

143
00:12:46,782 --> 00:12:48,477
Right. Come on in.

144
00:12:49,318 --> 00:12:52,446
I want to apologize for the puppies.
I went out...

145
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:56,116
to chain them up before you came,
but they got away from me.

146
00:12:58,294 --> 00:13:02,697
- Are those puppies always here?
- No, just when the armed guards are off.

147
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,597
I have some stats here
that you might be interested in.

148
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:08,500
Great!

149
00:13:08,571 --> 00:13:11,870
It's play diagrams from
our touchdown plays from last year...

150
00:13:11,941 --> 00:13:14,171
players' reports, things you might need.

151
00:13:14,243 --> 00:13:16,643
Great! I just wanna thank you.

152
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:20,204
I appreciate this so much,
you taking this chance on me.

153
00:13:20,282 --> 00:13:23,581
Right. How about some peanut brittle?

154
00:13:23,986 --> 00:13:27,353
We have a little left
from last year's fund-raising drive.

155
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:29,948
No, thanks. I'm too fired up to eat.

156
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:33,090
You got some real talent here.

157
00:13:33,462 --> 00:13:36,898
Raw, perhaps. I think with the help
of my assistant coaches...

158
00:13:39,101 --> 00:13:41,331
- No assistant coaches?
- Right.

159
00:13:43,973 --> 00:13:47,568
School starts in a week,
so we better start practice right away...

160
00:13:49,011 --> 00:13:50,376
No practice?

161
00:13:50,446 --> 00:13:53,438
I wouldn't even know
how to round the guys up.

162
00:13:53,682 --> 00:13:55,809
But if it's any consolation to you...

163
00:13:55,885 --> 00:13:59,082
a number of our players are returning
from last year, so...

164
00:13:59,154 --> 00:14:01,122
maybe it wouldn't take much coaching.

165
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:05,422
Your team only won one game last year,
'cause the other team's bus broke down.

166
00:14:05,494 --> 00:14:08,861
Yeah, that victory party
was something to see.

167
00:14:10,499 --> 00:14:11,989
Mr. Edwards...

168
00:14:13,502 --> 00:14:15,936
let's second-think this for a bit.

169
00:14:21,377 --> 00:14:24,073
Are you sure
I'm the right person for this job?

170
00:14:24,747 --> 00:14:28,444
Hey, Dan Darwell told me
that you were eminently qualified.

171
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:33,680
He also tells me that
it's your lifetime dream to coach football.

172
00:14:34,189 --> 00:14:36,817
- Is that right?
- That's right.

173
00:14:38,661 --> 00:14:42,188
If word got around
that you chickened out on this job...

174
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:45,734
you think anybody
would ever offer you another chance?

175
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:48,194
Yes?

176
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:53,771
- No.
- Right.

177
00:15:04,887 --> 00:15:08,414
- Coach, aren't you late for practice?
- I was just going.

178
00:15:09,024 --> 00:15:10,855
- Are you nervous?
- No.

179
00:15:12,394 --> 00:15:14,988
- Well, a little.
- I don't blame you.

180
00:15:15,464 --> 00:15:17,659
Hey, what are you guys doing?

181
00:15:20,869 --> 00:15:23,497
Wait a minute. You guys want to fight?

182
00:15:23,572 --> 00:15:27,201
Go ahead. Punch each other's head off.
Doesn't make any difference.

183
00:15:27,276 --> 00:15:30,143
Only tell your mother
you don't have a principal anymore.

184
00:15:30,212 --> 00:15:32,806
You got a parole officer. Understood?

185
00:16:02,277 --> 00:16:04,802
Suited up and ready to play, coach.

186
00:16:10,953 --> 00:16:13,922
Be on the five in field minutes.

187
00:16:23,132 --> 00:16:24,360
Oh, God!

188
00:16:30,506 --> 00:16:32,303
All right, listen up!

189
00:16:32,975 --> 00:16:37,469
If you're not here to play football,
clean out your lockers and leave now.

190
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:39,839
I like her tits.

191
00:16:40,983 --> 00:16:44,384
You. You're in training as of right now.
Put that out.

192
00:16:49,692 --> 00:16:53,093
All right. I don't intend to coach
a bunch of losers.

193
00:17:00,502 --> 00:17:03,232
Now, if you're not willing to work hard...

194
00:17:03,539 --> 00:17:06,804
She has a really cute ass,
you know what I'm saying?

195
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:10,043
Guys, look...

196
00:17:12,748 --> 00:17:15,808
I was raised on this sport. It's part of me.

197
00:17:15,884 --> 00:17:20,378
I know that I can help you
learn the game and win.

198
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:27,292
I think that with...

199
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:32,691
If we just learn to trust each other,
there's nothing we can't do.

200
00:17:33,001 --> 00:17:35,595
I mean, I'll help you. I'll be there.

201
00:17:36,872 --> 00:17:39,602
I just need for you to give me a chance.

202
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:44,108
Now, what do you say?

203
00:18:00,262 --> 00:18:02,253
Line up for calisthenics!

204
00:18:05,534 --> 00:18:08,332
Do you guys want to play football or not?

205
00:18:09,037 --> 00:18:11,164
Man, come on. Listen to her.

206
00:18:13,075 --> 00:18:14,303
Come on!

207
00:18:16,945 --> 00:18:21,109
We start out by stretching our hams.
Right foot over left, and hang.

208
00:18:21,917 --> 00:18:24,784
What is this?
You said we were gonna play football.

209
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:27,947
- What's up with that?
- You can't play if you get hurt.

210
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:30,992
- lf you're not properly conditioned...
- Zip that shit.

211
00:18:31,059 --> 00:18:33,857
Tell us when you want us
to play football, sweetheart.

212
00:18:33,929 --> 00:18:38,093
- What's happening, fellas?
- What you doing here, Bird? Are you lost?

213
00:18:39,301 --> 00:18:41,667
So, you're the coach.

214
00:18:43,672 --> 00:18:45,230
I am. Who are you?

215
00:18:45,307 --> 00:18:49,073
Ain't no thing, baby. I'm just a football fan.

216
00:18:51,513 --> 00:18:55,449
Don't be too rough on these girls,
'cause they really ain't got the stomachs...

217
00:18:55,517 --> 00:18:57,485
for all that physical activity.

218
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:59,578
Hey, Bird. You got a Walkman?

219
00:18:59,822 --> 00:19:04,350
I'm out of Walkmans, but I got Casios.
Who wants a watch? Come see the Bird.

220
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:11,889
- Are they coming back?
- lf there's a scrimmage here tomorrow.

221
00:19:11,967 --> 00:19:15,334
There will be a scrimmage here
tomorrow at 4:00.

222
00:19:16,638 --> 00:19:19,436
Do you want to show them up
at scrimmage tomorrow?

223
00:19:19,508 --> 00:19:22,671
- He's our quarterback.
- They're the best guys we got.

224
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:27,181
All the more reason to run rings around
them. Do you want to play football?

225
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,685
I can't hear you!
Do you wanna play football?

226
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:36,223
Don't wear yourselves out.

227
00:19:42,364 --> 00:19:44,924
I can't go back there tomorrow,
it's a disaster.

228
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,696
I'll call Edwards tonight
and tell him I can't do this.

229
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:50,363
- Darwell has a pool.
- Darwell bought a pool?

230
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:53,806
No, he's got everybody betting
on how long you'll last.

231
00:19:53,876 --> 00:19:57,004
- Oh, God!
- Is Wednesday a safe bet?

232
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:03,241
I want to forget this day.

233
00:20:06,188 --> 00:20:08,952
All right, sweetie. Thanks for the lift.

234
00:20:09,758 --> 00:20:12,386
- What's this?
- Just a little something.

235
00:20:13,762 --> 00:20:14,956
Thanks.

236
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:19,726
Mr. Edwards? Molly McGrath.

237
00:20:21,169 --> 00:20:22,602
Not so good.

238
00:20:23,438 --> 00:20:26,100
Actually, I wanted to tell you that...

239
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:28,333
I don't think that I'm...

240
00:20:34,082 --> 00:20:35,640
That's not fair.

241
00:20:39,388 --> 00:20:43,154
That it's not fair that I should be so lucky.

242
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:48,323
I just wanted to say
thanks again for picking me.

243
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:51,799
Okay. See you tomorrow.

244
00:20:55,037 --> 00:20:57,835
God, I even quit when I'm trying to quit.

245
00:21:02,811 --> 00:21:05,871
15, 16...

246
00:21:05,948 --> 00:21:09,008
17, 18...

247
00:21:09,084 --> 00:21:12,576
19, 20. All right.

248
00:21:16,558 --> 00:21:20,358
- What are you guys doing here?
- You said there's a scrimmage today.

249
00:21:20,429 --> 00:21:21,794
So take the field.

250
00:21:21,863 --> 00:21:23,797
Yeah. Let's go, man.

251
00:21:24,967 --> 00:21:26,901
All right, my guys, let's huddle up.

252
00:21:28,136 --> 00:21:30,127
I can break his damn face.

253
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:31,934
Don't do that, man.

254
00:21:33,241 --> 00:21:34,265
Let him play.

255
00:21:34,343 --> 00:21:37,574
Stay in strong, right.
Remember our first wrinkle, Peanut?

256
00:21:37,646 --> 00:21:39,546
- I think so.
- What are they doing?

257
00:21:39,614 --> 00:21:41,309
Kissing her ass, most likely.

258
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:43,578
All right. Let's fire them up.

259
00:21:43,652 --> 00:21:45,677
Watch this.

260
00:21:45,754 --> 00:21:46,914
Break!

261
00:22:00,936 --> 00:22:03,029
Look at Peanut. That twerp!

262
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:09,709
Yeah! Sure!

263
00:22:12,481 --> 00:22:14,142
That shit's pretty good.

264
00:22:14,716 --> 00:22:18,618
- Let's show them what football's all about.
- Kill them.

265
00:22:25,961 --> 00:22:28,327
Marvel, go deep. Phillips, run a post.

266
00:22:28,397 --> 00:22:31,093
Let's take care of them. On you. Ready?

267
00:22:31,566 --> 00:22:33,591
All right, let's go.

268
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:39,737
Blue. 22. Crush you.

269
00:22:44,479 --> 00:22:46,504
Come on. Stop those wimps!

270
00:22:54,156 --> 00:22:57,319
I'm getting tired of this shit, man.
I'm going in.

271
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:04,690
- What are we going to run now?
- Double reverse. I'll take it.

272
00:23:04,766 --> 00:23:06,927
Why don't you just play quarterback?

273
00:23:07,002 --> 00:23:09,698
I ain't seen you do no end-zone dancing.

274
00:23:09,771 --> 00:23:12,763
Hey, come on. Somebody think
of a good play. Let's go.

275
00:23:12,841 --> 00:23:15,639
Run anything, but just stay out of my way.

276
00:23:16,178 --> 00:23:20,808
All right. Left formation,
double reverse on bean.

277
00:23:20,882 --> 00:23:23,578
Try not to get me sacked this time,
bumblehead.

278
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:25,347
Ready. Let's break!

279
00:23:42,537 --> 00:23:45,233
That's on the chicken shit side.

280
00:23:45,307 --> 00:23:48,936
Sorry about that, Coach.
I was running my blocking assignment.

281
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:52,446
- I guess practice is over, Miss Coach?
- Let's get out of here.

282
00:24:00,489 --> 00:24:03,219
Hi, guys. Hi, Jeannie.

283
00:24:05,127 --> 00:24:08,494
- Nice day at school, Mom?
- Terrible.

284
00:24:11,366 --> 00:24:13,891
- But I got it all figured out.
- Yeah?

285
00:24:13,969 --> 00:24:16,597
I'm gonna get my old job back at Prescott.

286
00:24:16,805 --> 00:24:19,774
I'll be at the right place at the right time.

287
00:24:20,609 --> 00:24:25,342
Remo won't last long with the JV, so,
when he bombs out, Molly takes the field.

288
00:24:27,415 --> 00:24:29,212
Don't look at me like that.

289
00:24:29,284 --> 00:24:33,050
Going back to coaching girls' track
is not exactly the same as quitting.

290
00:24:33,121 --> 00:24:36,716
- Darwell hired somebody else for it today.
- I'll kill him.

291
00:24:36,791 --> 00:24:41,194
The problem with killing him though,
is that it goes on your record.

292
00:24:41,496 --> 00:24:43,521
It follows you everywhere.

293
00:24:43,665 --> 00:24:46,225
Well, I can stick it out.

294
00:25:32,647 --> 00:25:36,879
I'll bet she's getting in her van now,
tears streaming down her face.

295
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:42,052
She's too stupid to know when to quit.
But I hope she stays.

296
00:25:42,123 --> 00:25:45,024
I only got a few more days
before I get my hands on her.

297
00:25:45,093 --> 00:25:46,617
You're full of shit, Trumaine.

298
00:25:46,861 --> 00:25:51,855
What's the problem, man? She knows I got
10 pounds of dangling fury waiting for her.

299
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:55,664
I know she wants it.
I can tell by the way she looks at me.

300
00:25:55,904 --> 00:25:58,031
Put your pants on and listen up!

301
00:25:58,106 --> 00:26:00,734
Baby, we were just talking about you.

302
00:26:01,209 --> 00:26:02,904
Don't call me baby.

303
00:26:09,351 --> 00:26:10,909
What did he say?

304
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:12,851
He says, "Yes, ma'am."

305
00:26:17,058 --> 00:26:19,356
My name is Coach McGrath.

306
00:26:19,427 --> 00:26:23,295
If that's too much for you to remember,
then just call me "Coach."

307
00:26:25,934 --> 00:26:28,266
- Hey, Coach?
- Yes.

308
00:26:28,603 --> 00:26:31,663
Why don't you quit,
so we can get us a real coach?

309
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:36,302
Amen.

310
00:26:38,947 --> 00:26:40,574
You don't get it.

311
00:26:41,483 --> 00:26:43,781
I'm the only one who'll take this job.

312
00:26:43,885 --> 00:26:45,512
You ain't good enough.

313
00:26:46,121 --> 00:26:47,850
You want to get rid of me?

314
00:26:49,924 --> 00:26:53,257
- You really want to get rid of me?
- Yeah.

315
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:56,424
Absolutely.

316
00:26:57,265 --> 00:26:58,493
Step outside.

317
00:26:59,734 --> 00:27:01,998
If I drop before any one of you...

318
00:27:02,804 --> 00:27:06,205
- you can tell me to go to hell.
- We sure as hell will!

319
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:09,707
We'll help you pack your bags.

320
00:27:09,778 --> 00:27:10,802
But...

321
00:27:11,913 --> 00:27:14,245
if you quit before I do...

322
00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:17,982
then from here on out, I call the shots.

323
00:27:24,292 --> 00:27:26,317
- Got you!
- We're coming up on you.

324
00:27:27,228 --> 00:27:28,991
- We're gaining!
- All right!

325
00:27:39,207 --> 00:27:41,607
I'll bet you $50 the coach outruns them.

326
00:27:46,981 --> 00:27:50,610
She's crazy if she thinks
she can beat Trumaine or Cerulo.

327
00:27:51,052 --> 00:27:52,280
They're fast.

328
00:27:59,127 --> 00:28:00,219
I love it!

329
00:28:03,832 --> 00:28:05,857
Call me and let me know who won.

330
00:28:17,145 --> 00:28:18,737
What, you all leaving?

331
00:28:21,282 --> 00:28:23,477
I'll see you all at the bank.

332
00:28:25,487 --> 00:28:26,579
Here we go.

333
00:28:52,046 --> 00:28:54,640
It's raining. Let's call it a draw, okay?

334
00:28:55,116 --> 00:28:56,583
You quit, you lose.

335
00:29:42,664 --> 00:29:44,188
I forgot to tell you.

336
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:47,529
- I ran the Boston Marathon.
- Oh, shit.

337
00:29:48,002 --> 00:29:48,934
Twice.

338
00:30:30,712 --> 00:30:32,509
You owe me a new stopwatch!

339
00:30:34,282 --> 00:30:35,510
You pussies!

340
00:30:37,952 --> 00:30:39,180
Fuck you!

341
00:30:42,457 --> 00:30:43,719
Fuck you, what?

342
00:30:45,426 --> 00:30:46,552
Fuck you...

343
00:30:47,362 --> 00:30:48,624
Coach McGrath.

344
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:50,319
Better!

345
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:03,702
Frank!

346
00:31:04,479 --> 00:31:08,210
I'm sorry to barge in like this,
but I heard about the little job change.

347
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:10,444
Would you mind getting out of here?

348
00:31:11,452 --> 00:31:13,181
What is that on your eye?

349
00:31:13,421 --> 00:31:15,286
Cheap mascara. Now get out of here.

350
00:31:15,356 --> 00:31:17,290
Seriously, Molly, we have to talk.

351
00:31:17,358 --> 00:31:19,986
- Give me a towel.
- I'm not offended by nudity.

352
00:31:20,228 --> 00:31:23,163
Give me a towel. A big towel, Frank.

353
00:31:26,367 --> 00:31:28,130
So how are you doing in school?

354
00:31:28,202 --> 00:31:29,931
- Fine.
- Good.

355
00:31:30,405 --> 00:31:31,337
Great.

356
00:31:33,575 --> 00:31:36,840
Listen, I think it's terrific
you care about this coaching job...

357
00:31:36,911 --> 00:31:41,143
and it's great that the kids will benefit
from your experience and expertise.

358
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:45,310
You called, I wasn't home,
the school's in the ghetto...

359
00:31:45,386 --> 00:31:48,651
and you started thinking about
terrible things that could happen...

360
00:31:48,723 --> 00:31:50,850
thereby causing you inconvenience.

361
00:31:51,092 --> 00:31:54,687
So, you're here to tell me
that you don't like me coaching at Central.

362
00:31:54,762 --> 00:31:57,390
- I hate you coaching at Central.
- Tough.

363
00:31:59,233 --> 00:32:01,963
Excuse me? What did you just say?

364
00:32:03,705 --> 00:32:05,070
I said, "Tough."

365
00:32:06,608 --> 00:32:09,008
So, school is fine, right?

366
00:32:10,912 --> 00:32:12,777
That's terrific. That's just great.

367
00:32:12,847 --> 00:32:14,872
You don't care about my opinion?

368
00:32:15,116 --> 00:32:18,381
For the 10 years we were married,
your opinion was my opinion!

369
00:32:18,453 --> 00:32:21,980
For the four years we were divorced,
your opinion was still my opinion.

370
00:32:22,056 --> 00:32:25,082
- That's not true.
- Now I want my opinion to be my opinion!

371
00:32:25,159 --> 00:32:28,686
You don't even know what you're saying.
I always gave you your own way.

372
00:32:28,763 --> 00:32:31,254
- What?
- That's right. You wanted a van, right?

373
00:32:31,332 --> 00:32:33,960
- No, I didn't want a van!
- Wait a second...

374
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:35,696
You wanted the van.

375
00:32:35,770 --> 00:32:38,330
You wanted a van, we got a van!

376
00:32:38,406 --> 00:32:40,567
I didn't want a van, you wanted it.

377
00:32:43,611 --> 00:32:46,808
- So, are you getting ready for Halloween?
- It's only September.

378
00:32:46,881 --> 00:32:48,314
Oh, of course.

379
00:32:48,616 --> 00:32:52,450
...go out and trade in that
great little Valiant for that stupid van!

380
00:32:52,553 --> 00:32:55,818
And now I have a van
and I wish I had a Valiant!

381
00:32:57,525 --> 00:32:58,924
That isn't polite.

382
00:33:00,895 --> 00:33:04,387
I was just on my way to the kitchen
to get some more water.

383
00:33:04,866 --> 00:33:07,027
The kitchen is that way.

384
00:33:08,703 --> 00:33:09,761
Stephanie?

385
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:21,446
Stephanie, hello.

386
00:33:21,949 --> 00:33:24,509
Hello. Where's Frank?

387
00:33:25,086 --> 00:33:27,179
- He left.
- Oh, he left.

388
00:33:31,626 --> 00:33:35,289
- What are you doing, Stephanie?
- I was just waiting for you, Frank.

389
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:37,364
Come on, we're late. Let's go.

390
00:33:37,932 --> 00:33:39,229
See you, Molly.

391
00:33:40,201 --> 00:33:41,532
I'm sorry. Sorry.

392
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:43,467
I'm sorry, are you all right?

393
00:35:21,903 --> 00:35:23,894
This is last year's schedule.

394
00:35:25,573 --> 00:35:27,973
It's gone. Forget it.

395
00:35:29,644 --> 00:35:31,339
You guys are better now.

396
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:32,872
Much better.

397
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:35,539
Now, tomorrow's our first game.

398
00:35:36,984 --> 00:35:38,645
Forget the past.

399
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,551
Concentrate on tomorrow...

400
00:35:42,790 --> 00:35:44,690
and don't be nervous tonight.

401
00:35:51,065 --> 00:35:54,364
- You okay, Mommy?
- I'm fine, sweetie. Thank you.

402
00:35:55,636 --> 00:35:58,799
You can sleep in my bed with me
if you're scared, Mommy.

403
00:35:59,807 --> 00:36:01,434
I'm all right, sweetie.

404
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:04,036
Good night.

405
00:36:21,796 --> 00:36:24,526
<i>Let's rock, let's rock</i>
<i>come on and boogie</i>

406
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:28,933
<i>Boogie down, boogie down</i>
<i>Wildcats are the best around</i>

407
00:36:29,003 --> 00:36:32,234
<i>Boogie down, boogie down</i>
<i>we'll run those Cougars out of town</i>

408
00:36:32,306 --> 00:36:36,402
<i>Boogie down</i>

409
00:36:37,778 --> 00:36:38,904
<i>Let's rock!</i>

410
00:36:39,213 --> 00:36:40,578
Okay, listen up.

411
00:36:41,215 --> 00:36:45,117
Listen up. How can we concentrate
if they keep ringing that fucking bell!

412
00:36:45,186 --> 00:36:47,620
If they're the Cougars,
how come they got a goat?

413
00:36:47,688 --> 00:36:50,680
What are we bitching about?
We got a dog dressed like a cat.

414
00:36:50,758 --> 00:36:52,885
Can we talk about the game for a minute?

415
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:56,259
Okay. Jet, red right. 29-Z reverse.

416
00:36:56,330 --> 00:36:59,458
Speak English. Nobody understands
that code shit except you.

417
00:37:01,369 --> 00:37:04,805
Marvel, you go ahead, come back.
I'll give it to you.

418
00:37:04,872 --> 00:37:07,466
You give it to Trumaine.
Trumaine, you run upfield, okay?

419
00:37:07,541 --> 00:37:09,372
- On "whore." Ready?
- Break!

420
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:17,510
Black. 24. Black. 24.
Your mother's a whore!

421
00:37:27,461 --> 00:37:29,156
When we go with the veer...

422
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:31,391
you've got to hand off to the fullback...

423
00:37:31,465 --> 00:37:33,956
unless the tackle commits to the inside.

424
00:37:34,335 --> 00:37:36,803
Their tackles have been forcing the play.

425
00:37:37,071 --> 00:37:40,040
So you've got to read
the outside linebacker.

426
00:37:40,274 --> 00:37:43,903
If he commits to you,
then pitch to Marvel around the end.

427
00:37:44,245 --> 00:37:47,646
We're four points behind.
We can push right past them, right?

428
00:37:49,016 --> 00:37:52,144
You don't sound very convinced.
Don't you guys have any pride?

429
00:37:52,219 --> 00:37:54,710
- Yeah!
- Don't you have any guts at all?

430
00:37:54,789 --> 00:37:57,849
- Yeah!
- All right, then. Get out and get tough!

431
00:37:57,925 --> 00:37:59,984
- Yeah!
- Get mean!

432
00:38:00,962 --> 00:38:03,590
Those Cougars will be furballs
when we're finished.

433
00:38:05,232 --> 00:38:06,893
Let's go eat some pussy!

434
00:38:11,672 --> 00:38:14,698
Red. 26. Red. 26.

435
00:38:15,276 --> 00:38:16,868
The Cougars are dicks!

436
00:38:47,108 --> 00:38:49,042
All right, come on, guys. Good game.

437
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:51,203
Central, y'all still some rookies.

438
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:54,146
Good game, Cerulo.

439
00:38:55,716 --> 00:38:58,685
Way to go, Kru.
Hey, you guys played a great game!

440
00:38:59,286 --> 00:39:01,550
All right, we'll do better next week.

441
00:39:01,689 --> 00:39:03,179
Give it up, Central!

442
00:39:03,791 --> 00:39:05,486
- Nice game.
- Yeah, right.

443
00:39:06,293 --> 00:39:07,783
Congratulations. Good luck.

444
00:39:07,862 --> 00:39:09,227
Good game, Coach.

445
00:39:13,234 --> 00:39:15,600
- You'd better watch some more pros play!
- Hey, Mom!

446
00:39:21,242 --> 00:39:22,869
So we lost yesterday.

447
00:39:23,144 --> 00:39:25,669
The important thing is,
you played a good game.

448
00:39:25,746 --> 00:39:28,579
- Don't blow smoke up our ass.
- I wouldn't do that.

449
00:39:30,217 --> 00:39:32,242
Especially not up yours, Cerulo.

450
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:36,952
You guys have to remember, we've got
nine more games before the season's over.

451
00:39:37,858 --> 00:39:41,817
So we've got to get more disciplined,
work harder and get more organized.

452
00:39:42,296 --> 00:39:43,786
Cerulo, cut it out.

453
00:39:43,864 --> 00:39:46,094
- What's this?
- These are your playbooks.

454
00:39:46,167 --> 00:39:49,102
I'll put a play up there,
you'll write it in your books.

455
00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:52,901
I want you to memorize it, take it,
because you'll be tested on it.

456
00:39:52,973 --> 00:39:56,306
- Cerulo, okay?
- It ain't me, Coach. I'm innocent.

457
00:40:11,725 --> 00:40:13,818
You stole the Cougars' goat?

458
00:40:14,995 --> 00:40:17,520
- Edwards.
- Edwards? His name's Edwards?

459
00:40:17,598 --> 00:40:18,997
Principal Edwards.

460
00:40:22,937 --> 00:40:26,065
- Welcome to our locker room.
- Right.

461
00:40:26,707 --> 00:40:30,108
I thought you all played
a fairly decent game yesterday.

462
00:40:30,177 --> 00:40:32,611
Make that about 200 percent
more decent...

463
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:35,774
and we can start having
some victory parties around here.

464
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:38,614
We're working on it, aren't we boys?

465
00:40:39,086 --> 00:40:40,713
Thanks for coming down.

466
00:40:41,055 --> 00:40:45,219
I got a call from the principal
over at Jackson High.

467
00:40:45,459 --> 00:40:47,654
It seems they're missing their goat.

468
00:40:47,962 --> 00:40:51,728
I don't suppose anybody around here
would know about that, would they?

469
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:54,533
What did you say, Coach?

470
00:40:54,602 --> 00:40:57,799
My guys wouldn't know
anything about that, would we?

471
00:41:00,241 --> 00:41:01,230
Good...

472
00:41:01,675 --> 00:41:03,939
because if it's not returned today...

473
00:41:04,345 --> 00:41:08,406
any person remotely connected
with the disappearance of that goat...

474
00:41:08,482 --> 00:41:11,178
will be summarily expelled.

475
00:41:14,688 --> 00:41:16,212
That gets me steamed.

476
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:21,027
Right.

477
00:41:23,364 --> 00:41:25,855
I'm sorry I interrupted your meeting.

478
00:41:33,174 --> 00:41:34,573
A joke's a joke.

479
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:38,303
You guys are old enough
to be responsible for your own actions.

480
00:41:38,512 --> 00:41:42,608
I want a volunteer right now
on who will take that goat back, okay?

481
00:41:44,852 --> 00:41:46,376
Who's it going to be?

482
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:01,260
Good goat.

483
00:42:02,369 --> 00:42:03,734
Good little goat.

484
00:42:04,338 --> 00:42:05,703
Stay here, baby.

485
00:42:28,095 --> 00:42:31,394
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, baby. What's this?

486
00:42:31,932 --> 00:42:34,332
I got hungry, so I fixed myself dinner.

487
00:42:34,401 --> 00:42:36,869
Chocolate chip is not what I call dinner.

488
00:42:37,771 --> 00:42:39,033
Where's Alice?

489
00:42:40,641 --> 00:42:42,666
I'll fix you dinner in a minute.

490
00:42:43,277 --> 00:42:45,939
- Hi, Molly.
- Jeannie! New hairdo?

491
00:42:46,013 --> 00:42:49,210
- Yeah, do you hate it?
- No, but I think it really looks terrible.

492
00:42:49,283 --> 00:42:52,775
Great, no old person has liked it yet.
We're going to the library.

493
00:42:52,853 --> 00:42:54,684
- I'll take you.
- You don't have to.

494
00:42:54,755 --> 00:42:58,088
We got sick of waiting around,
so I called my mom. She'll pick us up.

495
00:42:58,158 --> 00:43:00,456
I'm not that late. I can still drive you.

496
00:43:00,527 --> 00:43:02,324
Jeannie's mom will take us.

497
00:43:08,135 --> 00:43:09,397
I'll take you.

498
00:43:10,070 --> 00:43:12,538
First I have to fix you something to eat.

499
00:43:13,607 --> 00:43:16,303
I can't believe she didn't say
anything about it.

500
00:43:16,377 --> 00:43:18,072
She must really hate it.

501
00:43:18,345 --> 00:43:20,074
She just doesn't care.

502
00:43:20,381 --> 00:43:22,872
I'm going to fix you a nice dinner
before you leave.

503
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:25,545
I don't want a nice dinner.

504
00:43:26,754 --> 00:43:28,278
That's my mom.

505
00:43:28,355 --> 00:43:32,052
Mom, I don't want to eat.
I just want to go to the library, okay?

506
00:43:32,593 --> 00:43:34,424
I'll take you after you eat.

507
00:43:34,828 --> 00:43:36,819
- We're going.
- No, you're not.

508
00:43:36,997 --> 00:43:40,865
Jeannie, you may go.
Alice, you'll stay here and eat your dinner.

509
00:43:40,934 --> 00:43:42,299
See you tomorrow.

510
00:43:45,506 --> 00:43:48,100
You don't even care if I do bad at school.

511
00:43:48,542 --> 00:43:51,875
It's all your fault you came home late
and we didn't have any supper.

512
00:43:51,945 --> 00:43:55,540
All you care about are those stupid boys.

513
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:59,444
You don't even care about my hair.
You didn't even notice it.

514
00:44:00,921 --> 00:44:02,115
I hate you.

515
00:44:20,841 --> 00:44:22,365
Alice, open the door.

516
00:44:24,545 --> 00:44:26,479
Okay, I hate your hair.

517
00:44:28,015 --> 00:44:30,142
I really, really hate your hair.

518
00:44:40,127 --> 00:44:43,654
I didn't want to be one of those mothers
who doesn't understand.

519
00:44:44,064 --> 00:44:45,326
But I didn't.

520
00:44:46,934 --> 00:44:48,299
So I guess I am.

521
00:44:49,636 --> 00:44:50,625
What?

522
00:44:51,805 --> 00:44:55,002
I wanted to be able
to talk calmly about your hair.

523
00:44:57,511 --> 00:44:59,445
Marian, come here, honey.

524
00:45:02,616 --> 00:45:05,642
You are the most important people
in my life.

525
00:45:05,986 --> 00:45:08,284
Much more important
than any football team.

526
00:45:08,489 --> 00:45:12,516
If that's true, why do you play with them
instead of making us dinner?

527
00:45:12,593 --> 00:45:15,118
I was late because
I had to do the shopping.

528
00:45:16,497 --> 00:45:18,590
I am now a football coach...

529
00:45:18,665 --> 00:45:21,156
and I want to be the best one
I can possibly be...

530
00:45:21,235 --> 00:45:24,762
just like I want you to be the best
at whatever you decide to do.

531
00:45:25,105 --> 00:45:27,699
I want to be a helicopter pilot.

532
00:45:27,775 --> 00:45:31,142
Don't be stupid, Marian,
you can't be a helicopter pilot.

533
00:45:31,211 --> 00:45:35,375
Of course she can. She can be anything
she wants to be, if she works at it.

534
00:45:35,582 --> 00:45:36,708
So can you.

535
00:45:37,785 --> 00:45:38,774
So can I.

536
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:41,945
Daddy says you're going to quit.

537
00:45:43,056 --> 00:45:44,216
He did, huh?

538
00:45:45,526 --> 00:45:46,891
Well, he's wrong.

539
00:45:47,528 --> 00:45:50,588
I'm not going to quit.
I'm going to see this through...

540
00:45:51,432 --> 00:45:53,161
but I need you to help me.

541
00:45:55,035 --> 00:45:58,061
- Can you do that?
- Okay.

542
00:45:59,273 --> 00:46:00,331
Alice?

543
00:46:03,043 --> 00:46:04,340
Okay, sweetie.

544
00:46:12,686 --> 00:46:14,813
- Principal Edwards.
- Coach McGrath.

545
00:46:15,322 --> 00:46:17,586
The goat showed up at Jackson High.

546
00:46:17,791 --> 00:46:19,850
Must have been catting around, I guess.

547
00:46:19,927 --> 00:46:22,225
I thought you'd be pleased to hear it.

548
00:46:24,298 --> 00:46:25,925
You don't look pleased.

549
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:29,867
Krushinski told me about last year's
quarterback, Lavender Williams.

550
00:46:29,937 --> 00:46:34,135
- Levander.
- Yes, the accent's on the second syllable.

551
00:46:34,241 --> 00:46:38,109
- You know him?
- We have this hate/hate relationship.

552
00:46:38,178 --> 00:46:40,646
You didn't show me his stats.
I'd like to see them.

553
00:46:40,714 --> 00:46:43,808
I figured no sense
in having your mouth water...

554
00:46:43,917 --> 00:46:46,215
for food you'll never get your fork into.

555
00:46:46,286 --> 00:46:50,484
- Are you saying I can't get him to play?
- I think that's what he's saying, Coach.

556
00:46:50,557 --> 00:46:53,355
- Right.
- I'd like to see his stats anyway.

557
00:46:53,427 --> 00:46:54,917
Just for the heck of it.

558
00:46:55,195 --> 00:46:57,220
Okay, I'll dig them out for you.

559
00:46:57,998 --> 00:47:00,558
Let's see here. Say, Krushinski...

560
00:47:00,634 --> 00:47:03,330
are you stepping down as quarterback?

561
00:47:06,139 --> 00:47:09,165
It's like I can run good and throw good.

562
00:47:09,476 --> 00:47:10,943
I just can't...

563
00:47:11,845 --> 00:47:13,312
run and throw good.

564
00:47:13,914 --> 00:47:16,439
- I'm thinking I want the team to win.
- Right.

565
00:47:16,617 --> 00:47:18,915
- Wow.
- I told you he was good.

566
00:47:18,986 --> 00:47:21,477
He's also a criminal and chronically truant.

567
00:47:21,555 --> 00:47:23,284
I didn't know he was sick.

568
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:25,785
What class would he be in about now?

569
00:47:26,126 --> 00:47:30,062
About now, he'd be in 11-A English.

570
00:47:30,797 --> 00:47:33,766
However, I seriously doubt
if he's in 11-A English.

571
00:47:34,001 --> 00:47:37,061
- Could I have his address?
- You don't want to go there.

572
00:48:14,441 --> 00:48:16,466
- Is Levander Williams here?
- No.

573
00:48:22,416 --> 00:48:24,543
- Where is he?
- At Maurice's.

574
00:48:26,053 --> 00:48:27,452
Where's Maurice's?

575
00:48:30,057 --> 00:48:32,958
Yeah, he's here a lot.
He's one of my suppliers.

576
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:35,287
But he ain't here now.

577
00:48:35,996 --> 00:48:38,191
Say, lady, is that your van outside?

578
00:48:39,833 --> 00:48:43,269
You ought to consider stepping up
to some genuine wire-wheeled hubcaps.

579
00:48:43,337 --> 00:48:45,464
No, thanks. I don't care for any...

580
00:48:48,275 --> 00:48:50,937
I was wondering if you know
where Levander Williams is?

581
00:48:51,011 --> 00:48:54,538
These beauties would cost you $400
anywhere else in town.

582
00:48:54,681 --> 00:48:56,911
But since you're a friend of Levander's...

583
00:48:56,984 --> 00:48:59,817
they're yours, installed, $80.

584
00:48:59,886 --> 00:49:03,344
If you could just tell me
where I might find Levander...

585
00:49:03,890 --> 00:49:05,187
$65.

586
00:49:05,392 --> 00:49:07,383
That's below wholesale, lady.

587
00:49:17,004 --> 00:49:19,063
- Whose ball?
- It's mine.

588
00:49:35,756 --> 00:49:37,314
I didn't mean to interrupt.

589
00:49:37,391 --> 00:49:40,121
Please, just continue doing
what you were doing.

590
00:49:44,364 --> 00:49:47,595
I was told that I would find
a Levander Williams here.

591
00:49:48,568 --> 00:49:50,195
I'm Levander Williams.

592
00:49:51,705 --> 00:49:54,435
No, I'm Levander Williams.

593
00:49:55,976 --> 00:49:56,965
What?

594
00:49:58,111 --> 00:50:00,602
All right. All kidding aside...

595
00:50:01,114 --> 00:50:03,309
I really need to find Levander.

596
00:50:03,817 --> 00:50:07,048
- He's about 18...
- I can show you about 18.

597
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:09,247
- Ain't no thing, let's go.
- Bird.

598
00:50:09,990 --> 00:50:12,481
Man, what are you doing in here, lady?

599
00:50:13,593 --> 00:50:15,424
You're Levander, aren't you?

600
00:50:15,762 --> 00:50:19,664
- I got an appointment to get to.
- Wait, Bird. I have to talk to you.

601
00:50:22,469 --> 00:50:24,630
I've been chasing after you for two hours.

602
00:50:24,705 --> 00:50:28,163
- At least give me five minutes.
- My playing days are over, lady.

603
00:50:28,742 --> 00:50:30,505
What's up, man?

604
00:50:30,744 --> 00:50:32,211
- Three minutes.
- No.

605
00:50:32,546 --> 00:50:35,947
- I really need to talk to you.
- Bird, step into my office.

606
00:50:43,123 --> 00:50:44,590
Let me handle this.

607
00:50:46,226 --> 00:50:48,592
Look here, our car won't start.

608
00:50:49,362 --> 00:50:52,092
We were wondering
if you could give us a ride...

609
00:50:52,432 --> 00:50:55,799
- to my mother's house.
- You and Levander can chat on the way.

610
00:50:57,571 --> 00:50:58,663
All right.

611
00:51:00,207 --> 00:51:01,435
Nice hubcaps.

612
00:51:01,942 --> 00:51:03,842
- How much did you pay for them?
- $65.

613
00:51:03,910 --> 00:51:05,275
You were robbed.

614
00:51:13,620 --> 00:51:17,522
I ain't got time for football.
I'm working on another career.

615
00:51:17,758 --> 00:51:19,089
Take the next right.

616
00:51:19,159 --> 00:51:21,525
If you're as good as your stats say...

617
00:51:21,595 --> 00:51:23,790
then we could attract college scouts.

618
00:51:23,864 --> 00:51:25,798
That could mean a scholarship.

619
00:51:32,339 --> 00:51:35,172
- Yeah, over here.
- Is this where his mother lives?

620
00:51:35,342 --> 00:51:37,469
Yeah, she got sick of the suburbs.

621
00:51:37,544 --> 00:51:41,878
We play Dearborn next week.
All I need to beat them is a passer.

622
00:51:41,948 --> 00:51:43,745
Give me the keys. Come on!

623
00:51:43,917 --> 00:51:44,906
Shit!

624
00:51:45,886 --> 00:51:49,982
- He said that key would work.
- Did you see me try it? Did the door open?

625
00:51:50,056 --> 00:51:52,183
You can't trust Jimmy. He's a criminal.

626
00:51:52,259 --> 00:51:54,284
I got sick of losing every week.

627
00:51:54,361 --> 00:51:57,353
Last year you didn't have
a decent coach. Now you've got me...

628
00:51:57,430 --> 00:51:58,658
and I'm good!

629
00:52:02,135 --> 00:52:03,932
Excuse me, what are you doing?

630
00:52:04,004 --> 00:52:08,134
The key my mother gave me doesn't work.
So we've got to go through a window.

631
00:52:08,208 --> 00:52:09,698
Yeah, wait a minute.

632
00:52:10,377 --> 00:52:13,540
He can't walk around on my van.
He's going to cave it in.

633
00:52:14,848 --> 00:52:17,476
Can you wait till
your mother comes home?

634
00:52:17,551 --> 00:52:22,215
His mother's in the hospital and needs her
nightgown or she won't let them operate.

635
00:52:22,289 --> 00:52:24,154
It's her lucky nightgown.

636
00:52:24,224 --> 00:52:27,318
I can't let him walk on my van.
He's too heavy.

637
00:52:28,161 --> 00:52:31,756
I'm not playing football,
so we have something in common.

638
00:52:34,734 --> 00:52:36,702
Look, if you get down...

639
00:52:36,770 --> 00:52:39,204
- I'll get up, okay?
- That's fresh!

640
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:45,537
- That's cool, man.
- Not cool.

641
00:52:45,612 --> 00:52:48,080
Get her down. We'll do this later.

642
00:52:48,281 --> 00:52:50,681
We do this now, Bird.
It'll take just a minute.

643
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:53,275
I said we'll come back later. Without her.

644
00:52:55,722 --> 00:52:57,087
Oh, my God!

645
00:52:59,426 --> 00:53:02,725
Come on, man, let's go!
You better come down, lady.

646
00:53:02,796 --> 00:53:04,286
Hold on, man.

647
00:53:09,102 --> 00:53:10,660
- Drop.
- I can't!

648
00:53:12,572 --> 00:53:14,938
Lady, come on. I'll catch you. Now, drop!

649
00:53:25,952 --> 00:53:28,853
Oh, my God! What's happening?

650
00:53:37,530 --> 00:53:40,328
- Bird, I'm in a trash can!
- Be quiet.

651
00:53:47,841 --> 00:53:49,832
You want me to be quiet?

652
00:53:50,243 --> 00:53:52,006
I'll tell you what.

653
00:53:52,479 --> 00:53:54,674
- You get my van back.
- No problem. Now, shut up.

654
00:53:54,748 --> 00:53:58,946
- Get back what I paid for those hubcaps.
- I'll talk to Maurice. Be quiet.

655
00:53:59,019 --> 00:54:02,079
And you play for Central
or I start screaming.

656
00:54:02,155 --> 00:54:06,182
Now, lady, look, that place belonged
to the biggest fence in town.

657
00:54:06,393 --> 00:54:11,023
The stuff was all stolen. I just wanted
to return it to the rightful owners.

658
00:54:13,099 --> 00:54:15,465
- We're in here!
- Are you crazy?

659
00:54:16,870 --> 00:54:18,132
Shut up.

660
00:54:25,779 --> 00:54:27,713
If you play football...

661
00:54:28,848 --> 00:54:30,611
my lips are sealed.

662
00:54:32,986 --> 00:54:35,420
You know what this is, don't you?

663
00:54:35,655 --> 00:54:37,350
This is extortion.

664
00:54:37,424 --> 00:54:39,585
That's an ugly charge, Bird.

665
00:54:40,327 --> 00:54:42,887
True, but ugly.

666
00:54:51,104 --> 00:54:52,298
Right!

667
00:54:52,906 --> 00:54:54,032
Left!
