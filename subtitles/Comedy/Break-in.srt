1
00:00:53,823 --> 00:00:55,581
Got a staring problem?

2
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:02,623
Fuckin' pervert.

3
00:01:17,881 --> 00:01:20,648
You're right on time.

4
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:26,151
Yeah, well let's get this thing
over with it, huh?

5
00:01:26,825 --> 00:01:30,585
What's your rush?
Have a drink.

6
00:01:38,069 --> 00:01:40,532
Give me a scotch,
straight up.

7
00:02:13,005 --> 00:02:14,637
Have a seat.

8
00:02:23,339 --> 00:02:25,039
Cheers!

9
00:02:39,634 --> 00:02:41,301
Where is it?

10
00:02:42,805 --> 00:02:44,529
Where is what?

11
00:02:46,909 --> 00:02:49,635
You wanna play fucking games
with me?

12
00:02:52,081 --> 00:02:55,010
You have something for me.

13
00:02:55,811 --> 00:02:57,711
I do.

14
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:02,488
I have a message...
from the Man.

15
00:03:06,963 --> 00:03:08,561
Are you okay?

16
00:03:11,535 --> 00:03:13,593
You look a little pale.

17
00:04:02,657 --> 00:04:04,957
You son of a bitch.

18
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:09,417
Always watch your drink.

19
00:04:15,018 --> 00:04:17,118
Break...

20
00:06:06,241 --> 00:06:08,041
Frank.

21
00:06:09,421 --> 00:06:11,684
Frankie.

22
00:06:13,025 --> 00:06:16,889
Yeah... I'm here.

23
00:06:17,829 --> 00:06:21,623
- You okay?
- Yeah.

24
00:06:22,224 --> 00:06:24,324
Fine.

25
00:06:26,105 --> 00:06:30,306
Meet me at the bar...
in one hour.

26
00:06:30,307 --> 00:06:33,707
- Okay?
- Okay.

27
00:07:05,513 --> 00:07:07,939
What is your problem, man?

28
00:07:11,452 --> 00:07:13,215
Let's make this easy.

29
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:15,716
Your wallet.

30
00:07:15,957 --> 00:07:18,149
Just give him
what he wants, man.

31
00:08:40,045 --> 00:08:42,508
You're early Frank.

32
00:08:43,882 --> 00:08:46,140
And you're late
a fucking pile of shit.

33
00:08:48,822 --> 00:08:52,514
This place is clear across town.
Why do we always have to meet here?

34
00:08:52,992 --> 00:08:55,916
Because it's clear across town.

35
00:08:58,031 --> 00:09:00,928
Another beer for you,
sweetheart?

36
00:09:00,929 --> 00:09:02,135
Please, yeah.

37
00:09:02,136 --> 00:09:03,768
And for you, darling?

38
00:09:04,105 --> 00:09:07,006
- Cola.
- Cola?

39
00:09:07,007 --> 00:09:10,872
Nothing a little more... stiff.

40
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:17,574
I like the service too.

41
00:09:18,675 --> 00:09:20,921
May I ask you something?

42
00:09:20,922 --> 00:09:24,659
Did you ever fuck a big fat girl
like that, with a big fat ass?

43
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:27,160
Look at the ass on her.

44
00:09:30,832 --> 00:09:33,033
It's not really my type.

45
00:09:33,034 --> 00:09:35,937
How about for 200 grand?

46
00:09:35,938 --> 00:09:38,940
Fuck a big fat girl,
with a big fat ass...

47
00:09:38,941 --> 00:09:40,641
200 K.

48
00:09:40,943 --> 00:09:42,232
I guess, I don't know.

49
00:09:42,233 --> 00:09:44,433
Look, so why am I here?

50
00:09:44,434 --> 00:09:46,433
Uh...

51
00:09:48,318 --> 00:09:50,644
You gotta see the Man.

52
00:09:51,854 --> 00:09:53,486
What does that mean?

53
00:09:55,192 --> 00:09:59,283
You know, your employer,
the Man...

54
00:09:59,563 --> 00:10:00,997
got a job for you.

55
00:10:00,998 --> 00:10:03,966
He wants to see you,
talk to you about it.

56
00:10:03,967 --> 00:10:07,132
He never wanted to me
for any of the other jobs.

57
00:10:08,105 --> 00:10:11,774
Well... this one's different.

58
00:10:11,775 --> 00:10:17,576
It's kinda important, very serious.
And... he wants to tell you personally.

59
00:10:18,716 --> 00:10:20,905
So, what about you,
you gonna be there?

60
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,519
No.

61
00:10:25,089 --> 00:10:29,526
I'm the agent... I just... uh,
I get the phone call...

62
00:10:29,527 --> 00:10:31,265
I supply the talent
and negotiate the deal,

63
00:10:31,266 --> 00:10:33,965
I take my percentage,
that's it. Pfft, done.

64
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:37,224
Well, but what
if I don't wanna meet him?

65
00:10:37,669 --> 00:10:40,765
There's nothing you can do about that,
it's already been arranged.

66
00:10:41,907 --> 00:10:45,599
You're gonna meet his man,
at the entrance to the Tower club.

67
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:49,100
Tonight, at eleven.

68
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:53,115
A free one, for you.

69
00:10:53,116 --> 00:10:54,916
Thank you.

70
00:10:55,889 --> 00:10:58,715
And a cola, for you.

71
00:11:06,716 --> 00:11:08,215
Look...

72
00:11:08,216 --> 00:11:10,716
and here's your, um...

73
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:13,767
here's your new throw away.

74
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:18,373
This is a big one, Frank.

75
00:11:18,813 --> 00:11:20,440
How big?

76
00:11:22,016 --> 00:11:24,540
As big as her ass.

77
00:11:24,941 --> 00:11:27,140
You alright, K.B?

78
00:11:28,889 --> 00:11:30,681
20 percent for me.

79
00:11:32,995 --> 00:11:37,594
So ... how much would it take
for you to fuck a girl like that?

80
00:11:42,006 --> 00:11:47,599
Frankie... I've had bigger
and better than that...

81
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,800
and did it for nothing.

82
00:12:01,924 --> 00:12:03,492
Follow me downstairs.

83
00:12:03,493 --> 00:12:05,182
The Man is waiting for you.

84
00:12:05,183 --> 00:12:07,483
He's waiting anxiously.

85
00:12:36,984 --> 00:12:39,284
Thank you, Haiku.

86
00:12:40,031 --> 00:12:42,466
His name is Haiku?

87
00:12:42,467 --> 00:12:47,336
We call him that, because he speaks
in Haiku's exclusively.

88
00:12:47,672 --> 00:12:54,034
That would be 5 syllables, followed by
7 syllables, followed by 5 syllables.

89
00:12:57,717 --> 00:13:00,777
What about simple
yes and no answers.

90
00:13:02,855 --> 00:13:06,185
- Haiku, are you queer?
- Homosexual?

91
00:13:06,186 --> 00:13:09,286
That life-style does not appeal.

92
00:13:09,829 --> 00:13:11,723
I do not like dick.

93
00:13:12,832 --> 00:13:18,692
You see,
5-7-5 perfect every time.

94
00:13:20,107 --> 00:13:21,739
Please sit.

95
00:13:25,512 --> 00:13:27,205
Hey, sugar...

96
00:13:27,206 --> 00:13:29,606
what can I get you?

97
00:13:31,017 --> 00:13:32,684
Cola.

98
00:13:33,019 --> 00:13:35,516
No alcohol, good.

99
00:13:35,717 --> 00:13:37,717
Keeps you alert.

100
00:13:39,059 --> 00:13:41,557
I wanted to meet you
for sometime.

101
00:13:42,063 --> 00:13:46,498
I'm a big fan of your work, obviously,
there been no repeat business.

102
00:13:46,734 --> 00:13:49,006
But I've respected
your position...

103
00:13:49,007 --> 00:13:52,038
not... wanting to meet
face to face.

104
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:54,371
Then why am I here?

105
00:13:54,409 --> 00:13:57,644
Job, just a job.

106
00:13:58,781 --> 00:14:03,549
If it's just a job, it would've gone
through the proper channels.

107
00:14:11,895 --> 00:14:15,556
It's delicate, Frank,
very delicate.

108
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:20,068
I apologise
for making you come here.

109
00:14:20,069 --> 00:14:25,903
But I had to be absolutely certain you
understood just what this meant to me.

110
00:14:27,704 --> 00:14:29,904
I'm dying.

111
00:14:32,513 --> 00:14:36,909
I'm dying, and there's absolutely
nothing I can do about it.

112
00:14:38,456 --> 00:14:42,720
Can you comprehend
what it means to a man like me.

113
00:14:42,827 --> 00:14:47,130
Who's always been able to control
every single aspect of his life.

114
00:14:47,131 --> 00:14:51,427
Suddenly, finds himself helpless.

115
00:14:55,974 --> 00:14:58,832
So, you're the job.

116
00:15:01,046 --> 00:15:05,243
You loose control, you do
what you have to do, to regain it.

117
00:15:06,084 --> 00:15:09,518
How and when?

118
00:15:09,655 --> 00:15:13,482
Slow down,
it's not that simple.

119
00:15:13,825 --> 00:15:18,785
- There's someone else.
- What'd you mean?

120
00:15:19,532 --> 00:15:25,528
Ooh, it's time, her set.
Watch, just... watch.

121
00:16:01,348 --> 00:16:03,511
Isn't she exquisite.

122
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:08,511
That's my woman.

123
00:16:33,877 --> 00:16:38,103
You know I been around too long
to deny what I have, Frank.

124
00:16:38,982 --> 00:16:43,117
- What are you?
- Jealous, selfish.

125
00:16:50,093 --> 00:16:53,062
She's only loved one man
before me, that I'm aware off.

126
00:16:53,063 --> 00:16:55,595
And I know very little of him.

127
00:16:57,101 --> 00:17:00,036
But I love her too much
to allow her...

128
00:17:00,037 --> 00:17:03,462
go on and forget me
after I'm gone.

129
00:17:05,737 --> 00:17:07,110
You see I've...

130
00:17:07,111 --> 00:17:10,575
decided not to die alone.

131
00:17:41,948 --> 00:17:44,440
You're the guy who eats alone?

132
00:17:49,857 --> 00:17:50,957
Excuse me?

133
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:53,860
You're always here,
and you always eating alone.

134
00:17:53,861 --> 00:17:57,220
- You're here alone.
- I'm waiting for my father.

135
00:18:01,101 --> 00:18:02,637
Where is he?

136
00:18:02,638 --> 00:18:05,638
I don't know,
I'm wondering the same thing.

137
00:18:05,639 --> 00:18:08,839
He was suppose to meet me here,
after a meeting.

138
00:18:12,681 --> 00:18:16,907
- The meeting probably ran late.
- Probably.

139
00:18:21,723 --> 00:18:24,588
I've seen you before?

140
00:18:24,926 --> 00:18:28,126
You always look like
you have a lot on your mind.

141
00:18:31,032 --> 00:18:33,830
Maybe I do have a lot
on my mind.

142
00:18:34,631 --> 00:18:36,838
What'd you do?

143
00:18:36,839 --> 00:18:40,834
- About what?
- Your work.

144
00:18:46,048 --> 00:18:49,781
- What'd you do?
- I'm a singer.

145
00:18:50,052 --> 00:18:52,288
I'm trying to be a singer.

146
00:18:52,289 --> 00:18:56,157
- Where'd you sing?
- I'm singing tonight at the Laba bar.

147
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:59,062
It's kinda my first show.

148
00:18:59,063 --> 00:19:01,731
I'm a little nervous about it.

149
00:19:50,049 --> 00:19:52,580
Can I get you a drink, sweetie?

150
00:19:53,381 --> 00:19:55,681
Cola, straight.

151
00:20:07,701 --> 00:20:10,225
Here to see the new talent, huh?

152
00:20:11,038 --> 00:20:13,027
Did reserve you
that one over there.

153
00:20:15,976 --> 00:20:18,976
Not that it matters
with this pair.

154
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:24,372
- How much?
- That one's on the house.

155
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:25,372
Thank you.

156
00:21:30,922 --> 00:21:34,758
- Thank you for coming.
- You're welcome.

157
00:21:34,759 --> 00:21:38,320
If you hadn't come in, I probably
would have faced an empty room.

158
00:21:38,563 --> 00:21:42,322
- Gotta start somewhere.
- You're right.

159
00:21:43,902 --> 00:21:46,136
- Your father never showed?
- No.

160
00:21:46,137 --> 00:21:48,604
I'm really worried.

161
00:21:49,008 --> 00:21:52,376
But I'm sure there's some
logical explanation.

162
00:21:53,946 --> 00:21:56,304
You're really amazing.

163
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:03,626
So, what'd you do?

164
00:22:07,127 --> 00:22:10,027
It's complicated.

165
00:22:10,964 --> 00:22:13,390
You're not a drug dealer,
are you?

166
00:22:15,691 --> 00:22:17,391
No.

167
00:22:18,392 --> 00:22:21,392
You're just the guy
who eats alone.

168
00:22:23,392 --> 00:22:25,192
Yeah.

169
00:22:25,546 --> 00:22:28,038
But tonight I ate with you.

170
00:22:28,039 --> 00:22:30,682
I'm glad
I could be there for you.

171
00:22:31,953 --> 00:22:35,445
I'm glad I could be there
for you too tonight.

172
00:22:51,478 --> 00:22:54,172
It's gonna happen
do her first.

173
00:22:55,978 --> 00:22:59,580
And then I'll be certain
it's done.

174
00:22:59,581 --> 00:23:03,942
Why don't you...
Why don't you just do it yourself?

175
00:23:05,989 --> 00:23:08,558
Oh, I could never do it.

176
00:23:09,459 --> 00:23:12,559
I love her to much
to do it myself.

177
00:23:19,459 --> 00:23:22,159
I fuckin' quit.

178
00:23:37,757 --> 00:23:39,991
Fuh'uh, fuck...

179
00:23:41,157 --> 00:23:43,991
- What?
- Fuh'uh...

180
00:23:44,995 --> 00:23:46,662
You can't help me.

181
00:23:49,134 --> 00:23:51,530
He called me.

182
00:23:52,038 --> 00:23:53,702
Let him through!

183
00:23:57,910 --> 00:23:59,668
Let him through.

184
00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:12,391
I'm not finished with you yet.

185
00:24:12,392 --> 00:24:15,418
You're all done for now,
so piss off.

186
00:24:19,032 --> 00:24:23,236
You have to excuse my friend, son.
He's a little hard of hearing.

187
00:24:23,237 --> 00:24:24,587
Yeah, not only that,

188
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:28,329
but you can't understand
a fucking word he's saying.

189
00:24:32,046 --> 00:24:35,440
That's enough,
both of you.

190
00:24:42,023 --> 00:24:43,781
You call me down here?

191
00:24:44,092 --> 00:24:45,816
I did, Frank.

192
00:24:45,993 --> 00:24:49,029
Listen, I'm a little concerned
about this deal you're in, Frank.

193
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:53,163
- I just found out about it this morning.
- Do you know where I was last night?

194
00:24:53,368 --> 00:24:58,694
Well yeah, I did, and I wonder,
you walk away from money.

195
00:24:59,407 --> 00:25:01,965
But, it could end up messy.

196
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:08,715
Frank, you're a talented boy
and you're smart.

197
00:25:09,885 --> 00:25:13,946
So, what I'm going to say,
won't come as any surprise.

198
00:25:14,156 --> 00:25:17,024
You can't change the past.

199
00:25:17,025 --> 00:25:19,026
Now everybody knows that.

200
00:25:19,027 --> 00:25:22,719
But you can look into your future,
and weigh your options.

201
00:25:24,032 --> 00:25:28,003
I was your associates associate,
for years.

202
00:25:28,004 --> 00:25:32,733
He tells me, that there's
a woman involved in all of this.

203
00:25:32,734 --> 00:25:34,378
There is...

204
00:25:34,379 --> 00:25:36,813
a woman from my past.

205
00:25:36,814 --> 00:25:42,607
Now you know as well as I do,
that's what really complicates things.

206
00:25:43,053 --> 00:25:48,425
The two things people like us
should never get to intimate with...

207
00:25:48,426 --> 00:25:51,626
are love and dead.

208
00:25:51,962 --> 00:25:53,994
You know why?

209
00:25:53,995 --> 00:25:55,495
No.

210
00:25:55,496 --> 00:25:59,036
Because there's no clean break
from either one.

211
00:25:59,037 --> 00:26:02,171
Now you finishing intimacy
with both.

212
00:26:03,375 --> 00:26:07,034
But it's not to late,
to make a decision.

213
00:26:07,035 --> 00:26:09,013
You know, if I was you
I'd listen to him.

214
00:26:09,014 --> 00:26:13,117
That's why they call him
The Wise Man.

215
00:26:13,419 --> 00:26:16,086
So you think
I should walk away.

216
00:26:16,087 --> 00:26:19,889
I can't answer that,
you know what you have to do.

217
00:26:19,992 --> 00:26:23,085
What about you? You're willing
to walk away from your cut?

218
00:26:23,086 --> 00:26:25,285
Of course he is.

219
00:26:25,386 --> 00:26:27,886
Of course.

220
00:26:28,601 --> 00:26:34,039
Keep it neat, and don't get involved
beyond what you were hired to do.

221
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:39,176
The Man's waiting with half your money,
all you gotta do is go pick it up.

222
00:26:41,113 --> 00:26:43,645
No clean break, Frank.

223
00:26:43,984 --> 00:26:45,742
Don't ever forget it.

224
00:27:04,105 --> 00:27:07,208
- Is the woman here?
- The woman is not.

225
00:27:07,209 --> 00:27:09,040
He send her shopping today.

226
00:27:09,041 --> 00:27:11,641
She shops quite often.

227
00:27:27,111 --> 00:27:29,574
Home...

228
00:27:41,111 --> 00:27:43,574
There he is.

229
00:27:48,286 --> 00:27:49,885
I, uh...

230
00:27:49,886 --> 00:27:53,587
trust everything is being...
planned accordingly.

231
00:27:55,025 --> 00:27:58,258
Well yes, it is.

232
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:04,624
Wonderful.

233
00:28:06,304 --> 00:28:08,593
Meet the lawyer.

234
00:28:09,006 --> 00:28:11,575
This is the first half
of the payment.

235
00:28:11,576 --> 00:28:14,305
The other half will be
deposited to your associate,

236
00:28:14,306 --> 00:28:16,806
upon completion of your task.

237
00:28:17,815 --> 00:28:21,617
I've arranged for the second half
to be paid for on completion.

238
00:28:24,057 --> 00:28:28,288
She... uh, singing tonight,
for her final show.

239
00:28:29,061 --> 00:28:30,356
It'll be
my last night with her...

240
00:28:30,357 --> 00:28:33,696
before you carry out
your obligation tomorrow.

241
00:28:35,067 --> 00:28:39,402
I need my final night
with her to... say my good-byes.

242
00:28:40,105 --> 00:28:43,704
- Does she know?
- Of course she doesn't know.

243
00:28:43,705 --> 00:28:45,679
I mean about you being sick.

244
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:49,680
Oh, no,
and I don't want her to.

245
00:28:50,781 --> 00:28:52,085
It's better...

246
00:28:52,086 --> 00:28:56,012
that way she won't have to...
worry and grief, when it's my time.

247
00:28:56,013 --> 00:28:58,587
And I won't have to
pass on alone.

248
00:29:00,894 --> 00:29:02,686
Perfect really.

249
00:29:03,364 --> 00:29:05,622
There's two problems.

250
00:29:06,734 --> 00:29:09,058
I don't like problems.

251
00:29:10,905 --> 00:29:12,363
What is it?

252
00:29:12,364 --> 00:29:14,064
There's a woman...

253
00:29:14,307 --> 00:29:16,701
a young woman,
I think she's been following me.

254
00:29:17,011 --> 00:29:19,903
I saw her last night
after our meeting.

255
00:29:23,151 --> 00:29:25,819
I saw her again this morning,
outside my apartment.

256
00:29:33,929 --> 00:29:38,289
- This woman, is she a Brunette?
- Yes.

257
00:29:42,104 --> 00:29:46,273
She's nothing to be concerned with,
she is of no consequence to you.

258
00:29:48,574 --> 00:29:51,112
You said there were
two problems.

259
00:29:51,113 --> 00:29:53,542
I need a gun.

260
00:29:57,019 --> 00:29:59,755
You're an Assassin,
and you don't have a gun?

261
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:03,593
I have guns,
this is a special one.

262
00:30:03,594 --> 00:30:05,608
This is not the manner
in which we discuss.

263
00:30:05,609 --> 00:30:07,129
this was to be carried out.

264
00:30:07,130 --> 00:30:10,227
This gun is of no
consequence to you.

265
00:30:10,867 --> 00:30:16,928
I would consider it a personal favor,
and I knock 10 thousand of my price.

266
00:30:20,077 --> 00:30:21,912
Okay.

267
00:30:22,113 --> 00:30:25,613
Haiku will direct you
to the Bishop.

268
00:30:25,718 --> 00:30:29,346
He will procure
what ever you require.

269
00:30:30,923 --> 00:30:32,587
Thank you.

270
00:30:33,362 --> 00:30:35,861
One more thing.

271
00:30:36,562 --> 00:30:40,331
No problems, huh?
Just solutions.

272
00:30:40,332 --> 00:30:44,232
After all, you'll be
carrying out my dying wish.

273
00:31:00,553 --> 00:31:03,187
He's been expecting you.

274
00:31:05,492 --> 00:31:07,419
This way.

275
00:31:25,846 --> 00:31:28,346
Welcome, my friend.

276
00:31:47,884 --> 00:31:49,645
Good hands.

277
00:32:00,684 --> 00:32:03,586
- What the hell?
- Don't mind him, that's just Rupert.

278
00:32:03,587 --> 00:32:07,178
He gets excited when there're
new visitors. Rubert go!

279
00:32:07,925 --> 00:32:10,684
Sit.
Stay.

280
00:32:12,596 --> 00:32:18,662
You keep a very good poker-face,
but I can see your wheels turning.

281
00:32:18,836 --> 00:32:21,601
I've seen a few things
in my life.

282
00:32:23,136 --> 00:32:25,101
Well...

283
00:32:27,011 --> 00:32:28,769
What can I get you?

284
00:32:31,916 --> 00:32:35,709
- Woman?
- No.

285
00:32:37,088 --> 00:32:39,055
Men?

286
00:32:41,056 --> 00:32:43,056
No.

287
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:48,655
- Drugs?
- No, I'm fine.

288
00:32:50,404 --> 00:32:54,163
Well then...
What's your pleasure?

289
00:32:54,264 --> 00:32:56,664
I need a gun.

290
00:32:58,110 --> 00:33:03,121
It seams odd to me, that a man
in your line of work...

291
00:33:03,122 --> 00:33:07,180
needs to come to me
for a simple fire-arm.

292
00:33:08,153 --> 00:33:12,090
It's not just any gun.
I need a small gun.

293
00:33:12,091 --> 00:33:16,693
- The tiniest gun you have.
- A tiny gun?

294
00:33:18,499 --> 00:33:23,403
- Big guns, not your thing?
- The smaller the better.

295
00:33:23,404 --> 00:33:27,172
I think we can help you.
Sweetheart...

296
00:33:29,075 --> 00:33:32,676
go find the gentlemen for me.

297
00:33:39,988 --> 00:33:42,553
Would you like to feed Rubert?

298
00:33:43,054 --> 00:33:44,654
No.

299
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,227
Are you sure?

300
00:33:48,028 --> 00:33:49,728
Yeah.

301
00:33:50,732 --> 00:33:53,625
You have no idea
how much better this is...

302
00:33:53,626 --> 00:33:55,926
then the real thing.

303
00:33:56,305 --> 00:34:00,332
Plus... he never shits
on the carpet.

304
00:34:08,184 --> 00:34:11,682
- Small enough for you?
- It's perfect.

305
00:34:11,988 --> 00:34:13,655
How much?

306
00:34:16,756 --> 00:34:19,156
No charge.

307
00:34:19,663 --> 00:34:22,697
So, what'd you want
in exchange?

308
00:34:27,905 --> 00:34:32,294
- What would you like, sweetheart?
- I want to fuck him.

309
00:34:32,976 --> 00:34:37,736
- Excuse me?
- She wants to fuck you.

310
00:34:39,083 --> 00:34:41,683
And I want to watch.

311
00:34:42,052 --> 00:34:44,743
How much, you freak?

312
00:34:46,558 --> 00:34:50,649
You know...
money is no good here.

313
00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:55,594
You... and her.

314
00:34:56,801 --> 00:34:58,427
We watch.

315
00:35:01,005 --> 00:35:04,731
Otherwise, buy your tiny gun
somewhere else.

316
00:35:15,756 --> 00:35:18,324
You should
consider yourself lucky...

317
00:35:18,325 --> 00:35:24,025
my last customer
had to fuck... Rubert.

318
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:16,308
What?

319
00:36:18,755 --> 00:36:20,054
Jesus...

320
00:36:20,055 --> 00:36:23,258
- Why you following me?
- What're you talking about?

321
00:36:23,259 --> 00:36:26,351
- You're following me.
- No, I'm not.

322
00:36:27,830 --> 00:36:29,897
I saw you outside
the Tower club last night...

323
00:36:29,898 --> 00:36:32,601
and I saw you
at my apartment this morning.

324
00:36:32,602 --> 00:36:34,136
You're following me...

325
00:36:34,137 --> 00:36:35,826
I wanna know why.

326
00:36:36,105 --> 00:36:39,174
The Man hired you for something,
I wanna know what.

327
00:36:39,175 --> 00:36:43,145
- Are you a cop?
- No.

328
00:36:43,146 --> 00:36:44,813
How do I know?

329
00:36:46,149 --> 00:36:50,475
Because the only the only hand-cuffs
I own are made of leather.

330
00:36:52,121 --> 00:36:53,788
You want the Man?

331
00:36:53,992 --> 00:36:55,624
I want Haiku.

332
00:36:56,061 --> 00:37:00,498
- His bodyguard?
- He's more then just a bodyguard.

333
00:37:00,499 --> 00:37:04,260
- Well, what is he then?
- He does the Mans' dirty work.

334
00:37:04,970 --> 00:37:07,537
- So do I.
- Please.

335
00:37:09,408 --> 00:37:11,597
Don't go.

336
00:37:19,051 --> 00:37:23,188
My husband did a deal with the Man
a few years back, that went bad.

337
00:37:23,189 --> 00:37:26,320
Haiku was send
to deal with it.

338
00:37:27,427 --> 00:37:30,216
I usually get that call.

339
00:37:36,002 --> 00:37:37,669
I give you one change.

340
00:37:41,073 --> 00:37:43,765
All you must do is beat me.

341
00:37:49,116 --> 00:37:51,579
And freedom is yours.

342
00:38:13,107 --> 00:38:16,175
Haiku showed no mercy.

343
00:38:19,848 --> 00:38:21,740
Haiku just does
what he's told.

344
00:38:22,984 --> 00:38:28,621
- Like you?
- Yeah... like me.

345
00:38:30,892 --> 00:38:33,863
Well, normally.

346
00:38:34,164 --> 00:38:37,905
The reason I followed you is because
no outsider has ever been allowed...

347
00:38:37,906 --> 00:38:40,102
as close to the Man as you.

348
00:38:40,103 --> 00:38:44,041
I figured you could help me
get close.

349
00:38:44,042 --> 00:38:46,141
Look...

350
00:38:46,142 --> 00:38:50,611
you want Haiku,
I won't stand in your way.

351
00:38:52,015 --> 00:38:54,649
But, you're not gonna help me.

352
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:57,780
I gotta help
somebody else first.

353
00:38:59,481 --> 00:39:01,281
Sorry.

354
00:39:54,981 --> 00:39:56,670
What's he doing here?

355
00:40:35,662 --> 00:40:37,296
That's him.

356
00:40:40,062 --> 00:40:41,786
He's the one.

357
00:41:18,305 --> 00:41:20,371
Well?

358
00:41:22,105 --> 00:41:24,671
They are not deceased.

359
00:41:24,876 --> 00:41:27,370
I find only him...

360
00:41:29,171 --> 00:41:31,571
Both of them escaped.

361
00:41:37,822 --> 00:41:39,814
Give me the Chinamen.

362
00:41:54,841 --> 00:41:57,566
I kill you,
I kill you now.

363
00:42:20,041 --> 00:42:22,966
Kill him! Kill him!
Kill him!

364
00:43:26,456 --> 00:43:29,293
Ho... hold it...
Hold it right there!

365
00:43:45,156 --> 00:43:49,423
The Man wants to talk,
he ask if you please join him.

366
00:43:49,424 --> 00:43:51,095
I will escort you.

367
00:43:51,096 --> 00:43:53,593
Fuck!

368
00:44:01,641 --> 00:44:03,525
I don't wish to fight.

369
00:44:03,526 --> 00:44:05,802
I will take you to the Man.

370
00:44:05,945 --> 00:44:07,712
A job awaits you.

371
00:44:09,114 --> 00:44:10,746
Who did you want
you tell me?

372
00:44:12,051 --> 00:44:13,649
I work for the Man.

373
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:15,989
He'll pay you handsomely.

374
00:44:15,990 --> 00:44:18,557
To kick a suckers ass.

375
00:44:18,558 --> 00:44:20,886
Why didn't you say so.

376
00:44:22,128 --> 00:44:24,152
I'll come with you.

377
00:44:55,796 --> 00:44:57,663
I'll talk to you later.

378
00:45:03,105 --> 00:45:05,602
Won't they find us here?

379
00:45:08,503 --> 00:45:10,178
No.

380
00:45:10,179 --> 00:45:12,846
Isn't this your place, though?

381
00:45:13,747 --> 00:45:15,647
Trust me.

382
00:45:20,647 --> 00:45:22,297
Frank...

383
00:45:26,729 --> 00:45:29,297
I never knew
what happened that day.

384
00:45:31,168 --> 00:45:33,336
I was wondering
if I ever see you again.

385
00:45:33,337 --> 00:45:36,705
It's complicated, Frank.

386
00:45:37,541 --> 00:45:41,069
I looked for you every time
I ate at that coffee shop.

387
00:45:41,178 --> 00:45:43,846
Every night I think to myself.

388
00:45:45,149 --> 00:45:48,740
Maybe tonight,
I won't have to eat alone.

389
00:45:49,741 --> 00:45:52,156
But you were never there.

390
00:45:52,157 --> 00:45:55,657
There's a lot you don't
know about that day, Frank.

391
00:45:56,194 --> 00:45:58,886
My father...

392
00:45:58,887 --> 00:46:00,887
he died that day.

393
00:46:01,166 --> 00:46:03,834
That's why
he never made it to my show.

394
00:46:05,604 --> 00:46:07,971
I'm so sorry.

395
00:46:24,657 --> 00:46:28,126
- How did he die?
- I don't know.

396
00:46:28,127 --> 00:46:30,658
They never told me.

397
00:46:31,096 --> 00:46:35,688
He wasn't exactly healthy, but...
he wasn't that old either.

398
00:46:39,004 --> 00:46:41,162
My father was a great man.

399
00:46:42,209 --> 00:46:45,007
But, he did
some stupid things.

400
00:46:45,213 --> 00:46:48,108
He owed the Man a lotta money.

401
00:46:49,116 --> 00:46:52,876
When he died,
it was made clear to me, that...

402
00:46:52,877 --> 00:46:56,176
I had to work off his depths.

403
00:46:56,277 --> 00:46:58,977
So, I went to live with him.

404
00:46:58,978 --> 00:47:01,277
Do you love him?

405
00:47:02,129 --> 00:47:05,696
He puts me on that stage
and ask me to live my dream.

406
00:47:07,002 --> 00:47:10,070
No, I'm not in love with him.

407
00:47:13,141 --> 00:47:17,572
There's a lot you don't know
about the Man, he's dying.

408
00:47:18,013 --> 00:47:20,471
- He's what?
- He's dying.

409
00:47:20,472 --> 00:47:21,983
He's...

410
00:47:21,984 --> 00:47:23,810
terminally ill.

411
00:47:25,511 --> 00:47:28,211
He hired someone
to take him out.

412
00:47:29,393 --> 00:47:32,192
What?
No, it doesn't make any sense,

413
00:47:32,193 --> 00:47:34,002
if something was wrong
he would've told me.

414
00:47:34,003 --> 00:47:35,431
- Trust me.
- Trust you?

415
00:47:35,432 --> 00:47:37,792
How do you know all of this?

416
00:47:38,802 --> 00:47:41,169
Because I'm the one he hired.

417
00:47:44,708 --> 00:47:46,868
And he wanted me
to take you out with him.

418
00:47:55,653 --> 00:47:59,456
I take it you are aware
of how jealous he is.

419
00:47:59,457 --> 00:48:02,487
One of the guys don't want you to
ever move on after he's gone, so he...

420
00:48:02,488 --> 00:48:04,988
made you part of the equation.

421
00:48:08,032 --> 00:48:10,825
Lately he ask me
what I was thinking about?

422
00:48:12,102 --> 00:48:17,395
I told him about you,
the short time we spend together.

423
00:48:18,142 --> 00:48:23,403
How happy you made me,
and how alive you made me feel.

424
00:48:24,651 --> 00:48:27,881
He didn't like it,
not one bid.

425
00:48:29,155 --> 00:48:33,256
He promised me that one day
I feel the same way toward him...

426
00:48:33,657 --> 00:48:35,657
I never did.

427
00:48:37,163 --> 00:48:40,954
If you want me
to go with you, I will.

428
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:44,136
You can't cross the line
and get away clean.

429
00:48:44,137 --> 00:48:46,771
It doesn't matter what we do,
they'll find us.

430
00:48:48,208 --> 00:48:51,741
- There's only one thing that can help.
- What's that?

431
00:48:53,742 --> 00:48:55,742
Carrying out
a dying mans last wish.

432
00:48:57,242 --> 00:48:59,242
Only way.

433
00:49:05,499 --> 00:49:07,257
Hey.

434
00:49:08,799 --> 00:49:11,098
- Frankie.
- Yeah.

435
00:49:11,099 --> 00:49:13,657
What the fuck did you do?

436
00:49:13,735 --> 00:49:15,269
I did what I had to.

437
00:49:15,270 --> 00:49:18,839
- Did you get the money?
- First half. 100 K.

438
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:21,035
But don't hold your breath
for the rest of it.

439
00:49:21,036 --> 00:49:22,935
I figured that.

440
00:49:23,111 --> 00:49:25,546
The Man is pissed, okay?

441
00:49:25,547 --> 00:49:28,672
We gotta talk, you gonna get
your ass down the bar.

442
00:49:29,017 --> 00:49:32,916
- Is it safe?
- What'd you mean is it fucking safe?

443
00:49:33,122 --> 00:49:36,791
It's on the other side of town,
you think that's an accident?

444
00:49:56,747 --> 00:49:59,015
I have to go meet someone.

445
00:49:59,016 --> 00:50:01,728
You'll be safe here,
until I get back.

446
00:50:01,729 --> 00:50:04,778
Just stay away from the windows,
and the door.

447
00:50:38,724 --> 00:50:41,356
You fucked everything all up!
You fucked it all up!

448
00:50:41,357 --> 00:50:44,295
No, I didn't,
they fucked it up.

449
00:50:44,296 --> 00:50:47,260
If it was any other woman
any other woman in the world...

450
00:50:47,261 --> 00:50:50,068
I be planning
a double-homicide right now.

451
00:50:50,069 --> 00:50:52,338
I don't think
start it again.

452
00:50:52,339 --> 00:50:55,028
I know exactly
where I started.

453
00:50:58,077 --> 00:51:00,178
- Where is she?
- She's safe.

454
00:51:00,179 --> 00:51:02,277
Safe where?

455
00:51:03,182 --> 00:51:06,011
Clear across town safe.

456
00:51:12,159 --> 00:51:15,760
The big Man's gonna start a war
over this whole fucking thing.

457
00:51:15,761 --> 00:51:17,063
He's gonna start
a fucking war.

458
00:51:17,064 --> 00:51:20,488
Well, let him.
I'm ready.

459
00:51:27,789 --> 00:51:29,789
You okay?

460
00:51:33,190 --> 00:51:35,790
Yeah, I'm okay.

461
00:51:36,591 --> 00:51:38,591
I'm sorry...

462
00:51:38,592 --> 00:51:40,091
I'm sorry...

463
00:51:40,092 --> 00:51:41,893
I'm sorry, Frank.

464
00:51:41,894 --> 00:51:44,891
I'm sorry...

465
00:51:57,809 --> 00:52:00,008
So...

466
00:52:01,709 --> 00:52:04,845
He send you after me?

467
00:52:21,064 --> 00:52:22,753
Two ways to do this, Frank.

468
00:52:24,035 --> 00:52:27,602
The easy way?
Or my way?

469
00:52:28,573 --> 00:52:30,634
Choose one.

470
00:52:30,835 --> 00:52:34,035
There's a reason the Man always
contracted me up till now.

471
00:52:34,036 --> 00:52:37,036
Why is that?

472
00:52:37,081 --> 00:52:42,249
Blijkbaar, I'm the best.

473
00:52:44,155 --> 00:52:48,092
Shit joke, Frank,
I'm gonna take you down.

474
00:52:48,093 --> 00:52:50,358
- How much is he paying you?
- Enough.

475
00:52:50,793 --> 00:52:52,858
How much?

476
00:52:53,232 --> 00:52:58,668
- Twenty-five.
- Pays me fifty.

477
00:53:48,991 --> 00:53:54,451
- You... pour me drink.
- Wha... what would you like, sir?

478
00:53:54,563 --> 00:53:58,090
- Tequila.
- What brand, sir?

479
00:53:58,591 --> 00:54:00,191
Top shelf.

480
00:54:14,784 --> 00:54:17,144
You're in trouble now,
mother-fucker.

481
00:54:21,784 --> 00:54:24,144
Look, the Man
wants you alive.

482
00:54:26,129 --> 00:54:28,626
The Man's gonna die alone.

483
00:54:30,067 --> 00:54:34,635
- You want something, motherfucker?
- Something worth fighting for.

484
00:54:35,236 --> 00:54:37,136
You gotta a death-wish.

485
00:55:00,236 --> 00:55:02,136
Frank.

486
00:55:10,616 --> 00:55:13,083
- Thanks.
- Don't mention it.

487
00:55:16,116 --> 00:55:17,783
Let's get the hell
out of here.

488
00:55:24,116 --> 00:55:27,283
Hey.
Teach me karate.

489
00:55:52,186 --> 00:55:54,554
Who in the hell was that?

490
00:55:54,555 --> 00:55:59,418
It's the Chinamen, one of the
deadliest Assassins in the world.

491
00:55:59,661 --> 00:56:02,888
At least he was, until he
gave out to a drinking-problem.

492
00:56:02,889 --> 00:56:05,316
Now he's just a loose cannon.

493
00:56:05,317 --> 00:56:08,393
The Man contracted him,
he wanna take me out.

494
00:56:08,404 --> 00:56:10,865
After what you took
the other night at the Tower club,

494
00:56:10,866 --> 00:56:12,565
I'm not surprised.

495
00:56:12,708 --> 00:56:14,201
You stole his woman.

496
00:56:14,202 --> 00:56:16,971
He stole her from me first.

497
00:56:17,145 --> 00:56:22,213
- Are you gonna run?
- No... no, we can't.

498
00:56:23,185 --> 00:56:25,152
I have to finish this.

499
00:56:26,457 --> 00:56:30,117
Great, then I'm coming with you.

500
00:56:30,218 --> 00:56:32,918
No, you're not.

501
00:56:33,630 --> 00:56:36,524
The way I figure it,
I just saved your ass.

502
00:56:36,525 --> 00:56:38,067
You owe me one.

503
00:56:38,068 --> 00:56:41,527
You didn't save me,
you helped me.

504
00:56:42,139 --> 00:56:45,498
And it doesn't obligate me
to do favors for you.

505
00:56:46,777 --> 00:56:48,502
You're going after the Man,

506
00:56:48,503 --> 00:56:51,214
you don't think you gonna
have to go through Haiku first.

507
00:56:51,215 --> 00:56:53,231
Let me rebate you
from that burden.

508
00:56:53,232 --> 00:56:56,182
And how you gonna
take out Haiku?

509
00:56:56,254 --> 00:56:59,349
Don't worry about that,
just get me to him.

510
00:57:01,059 --> 00:57:03,742
I'm not gonna safe your ass,
if you do this.

511
00:57:03,743 --> 00:57:05,951
You're not gonna have to.

512
00:58:01,121 --> 00:58:02,753
What's wrong?

513
00:58:03,121 --> 00:58:04,953
Frank!

514
00:58:12,233 --> 00:58:15,265
Doesn't he understand
I don't love him.

515
00:58:16,872 --> 00:58:19,398
It's only gonna make
things worse.

516
00:58:20,576 --> 00:58:22,700
It's Frank that you love.

517
00:58:23,212 --> 00:58:25,675
The Man can not stand
that truth.

518
00:58:27,216 --> 00:58:29,747
Either way you loose.

519
00:58:30,454 --> 00:58:32,581
It's him that will loose.

520
00:58:32,822 --> 00:58:36,883
He could've just lost his life,
now he looses me too.

521
00:59:00,020 --> 00:59:02,655
The Man sends his word.

522
00:59:02,656 --> 00:59:05,756
You versus the Chinamen.

523
00:59:17,602 --> 00:59:19,863
A fight to the dead.

524
00:59:24,209 --> 00:59:26,411
Do I have a choice in that?

525
00:59:26,412 --> 00:59:29,170
You got no choice,
mother-fucker.

526
00:59:30,649 --> 00:59:33,409
And no bitch,
to safe you this time.

527
01:00:05,653 --> 01:00:09,848
You cut my face,
now I'm gonna break you.

528
01:00:10,953 --> 01:00:13,148
If I win?

529
01:00:14,653 --> 01:00:17,148
Fuck that...

530
01:01:16,059 --> 01:01:20,094
This is a great... Moment.

531
01:01:44,222 --> 01:01:47,653
I can't believe you fucking
shot me, you bitch...

532
01:01:48,395 --> 01:01:51,829
Fuck!
Stop fucking doing that.

533
01:01:52,098 --> 01:01:54,766
Where did you manage
to hide that?

534
01:01:56,536 --> 01:01:58,725
Use your imagination.

535
01:02:16,026 --> 01:02:17,826
Hello Haiku.

536
01:02:20,828 --> 01:02:22,695
I know your face well.

537
01:02:23,197 --> 01:02:28,563
You've been after me a while.
poor, weak, helpless girl.

538
01:02:30,204 --> 01:02:32,838
You killed my husband.

539
01:02:34,074 --> 01:02:39,311
That's quite possible,
I killed many worthless men.

540
01:02:40,181 --> 01:02:42,213
Yours was no different.

541
01:02:45,153 --> 01:02:48,845
Your time has come Haiku,
me and you.

542
01:02:57,065 --> 01:02:58,754
You are not kidding.

543
01:03:00,236 --> 01:03:02,665
You really wanna fight me?

544
01:03:03,839 --> 01:03:05,997
Bitch gonna get hurt.

545
01:04:11,243 --> 01:04:15,778
- What you gonna do with them?
- I leave the Chinamen for you.

546
01:04:16,116 --> 01:04:19,775
This one however,
I have plans for.

547
01:04:22,806 --> 01:04:29,819
Now Haiku, in the end you didn't allow
my husband to make any decisions.

548
01:04:30,129 --> 01:04:32,763
You are a cold-blooded bastard.

549
01:04:33,266 --> 01:04:38,001
Unlike you however,
I do have a heart, and...

550
01:04:38,839 --> 01:04:43,398
I will allow you to make...
some decisions here.

551
01:04:43,399 --> 01:04:45,244
So...

552
01:04:45,245 --> 01:04:52,715
in five syllables,
where would you like the first cut?

553
01:04:54,223 --> 01:04:59,689
Oh... I'm in trouble,
let me help you.

554
01:05:00,329 --> 01:05:04,390
How about...

555
01:05:04,491 --> 01:05:07,991
- across the stomach.
- Ahh...

556
01:05:18,848 --> 01:05:23,319
Now I need another 7 syllables,
for the next cut.

557
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:29,585
Hm... I've got it,
slice across the upper...

558
01:05:29,586 --> 01:05:33,286
- groin.
- Ahh...

559
01:05:41,206 --> 01:05:43,005
Please...

560
01:05:43,006 --> 01:05:46,632
don't do it,
please stop.

561
01:05:46,633 --> 01:05:48,501
Stop?

562
01:05:48,612 --> 01:05:50,748
I can't stop.

563
01:05:50,749 --> 01:05:56,587
There's another line in this, Haiku,
another 5 syllables.

564
01:05:56,588 --> 01:05:59,984
Oh, you know what?
I got it.

565
01:06:00,285 --> 01:06:04,485
Slash the fucking throat.

566
01:06:18,811 --> 01:06:23,413
Haiku was a bad man,
he got what he deserved.

567
01:06:23,414 --> 01:06:25,685
You did a good job.

568
01:06:25,686 --> 01:06:27,944
Your turn.

569
01:06:40,868 --> 01:06:43,628
The Man request your presents
on his Yacht.

570
01:06:50,845 --> 01:06:52,677
What about you two?

571
01:06:53,214 --> 01:06:56,377
I trust you two
handle the Man on my behalf.

572
01:06:56,378 --> 01:06:58,278
I will.

573
01:06:59,378 --> 01:07:01,221
So...

574
01:07:01,222 --> 01:07:02,946
What life for you?

575
01:07:03,860 --> 01:07:05,619
I'm... not sure,

576
01:07:05,620 --> 01:07:09,627
I thought of nothing but today,
for someone.

577
01:07:12,134 --> 01:07:14,665
I'm in need
of a new associate.

578
01:07:16,008 --> 01:07:19,971
Something tells me our line of work
wouldn't be objectionable to you.

579
01:07:20,810 --> 01:07:25,369
- I'll call you.
- Don't have phone.

580
01:07:25,481 --> 01:07:30,545
- So, how do I get in touch?
- Don't worry, I'll find you.

581
01:08:56,618 --> 01:08:59,149
Please...
sit with me.

582
01:09:04,818 --> 01:09:09,509
If you defeated the Chinamen,
then you are the better killer.

583
01:09:09,510 --> 01:09:12,383
I know I'm not a better killer
I just need to be sharp.

584
01:09:13,227 --> 01:09:15,596
That's why
I never drink alcohol.

585
01:09:15,597 --> 01:09:17,855
The Chinamen should've
followed my example.

586
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:20,798
What about Haiku?

587
01:09:22,136 --> 01:09:24,403
That Brunette I told you about.

588
01:09:25,239 --> 01:09:28,703
Apparently she was a great
consequence to Haiku.

589
01:09:29,644 --> 01:09:36,179
Well done I suppose, now you wish to...
finish me as well, I guess?

590
01:09:36,719 --> 01:09:39,750
Maybe so.
I like to let you live out...

591
01:09:39,751 --> 01:09:42,550
the short time
you have left all alone.

592
01:09:43,192 --> 01:09:46,423
I think it be
the worst possible ending.

593
01:09:48,298 --> 01:09:51,598
But I don't think I can trust you
to stay out of our lives.

594
01:09:53,599 --> 01:09:55,199
There is the wimp.

595
01:09:56,507 --> 01:09:58,865
What about you, my dear?

596
01:09:59,276 --> 01:10:02,231
You can honestly say
you feel nothing for me...

597
01:10:02,232 --> 01:10:04,709
meaning
I sit here at your mercy.

598
01:10:05,350 --> 01:10:08,086
I feel I've worked off
my debt to you.

599
01:10:08,087 --> 01:10:10,286
And so much more.

600
01:10:10,287 --> 01:10:13,318
In fact it's I
who's indebted to you.

601
01:10:13,319 --> 01:10:15,519
For what?

602
01:10:15,860 --> 01:10:21,231
For infallible meaning that...
pure blessing is "true love".

603
01:10:21,232 --> 01:10:26,434
"True love"?
You call what we had true love?

604
01:10:26,905 --> 01:10:30,706
- Sure was from my prospective.
- I felt like a prisoner.

605
01:10:30,876 --> 01:10:33,337
And you gonna have me killed because
you couldn't bare the thought of me...

606
01:10:33,338 --> 01:10:36,738
going on and being happy
when you're gone.

607
01:10:37,449 --> 01:10:40,717
You sad, sad, old man.

608
01:10:42,187 --> 01:10:46,355
You put me on that stage for your
own interest and to manipulate me.

609
01:10:48,060 --> 01:10:51,793
I wouldn't be surprised if your
the one that killed my father.

610
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:57,733
No my dear, I'm not the man
who killed your father.

611
01:10:57,804 --> 01:11:01,705
Everyone knows what you do to men
who don't pay their debts on time.

612
01:11:01,841 --> 01:11:05,684
Not from me, the man
who killed your father is the...

613
01:11:05,685 --> 01:11:08,544
gentlemen sitting
right next to you.

614
01:11:10,250 --> 01:11:12,048
Me?

615
01:11:17,007 --> 01:11:19,418
Well, what're you gonna say,
sweetheart?

615
01:11:19,419 --> 01:11:21,618
Cat got your tongue?

616
01:11:21,930 --> 01:11:25,789
Where's your undying love for him,
if you feel that way?

617
01:11:27,090 --> 01:11:29,390
Did you?

618
01:11:30,602 --> 01:11:32,008
- Where is he?
- I don't know,

619
01:11:32,009 --> 01:11:34,242
I'm wondering the same thing.

620
01:11:34,243 --> 01:11:37,407
He was suppose to meet me here
after the meeting.

621
01:11:41,551 --> 01:11:44,282
You're right on time.

622
01:11:44,283 --> 01:11:48,582
Yeah, well let's get this thing
over with, huh?

623
01:11:51,003 --> 01:11:53,793
I had no idea who he was.

624
01:11:54,229 --> 01:11:56,863
How could you?

625
01:11:58,264 --> 01:12:00,664
I was hired...

626
01:12:01,204 --> 01:12:03,838
- hired by him.
- Me?

627
01:12:03,974 --> 01:12:06,474
I hired you?
When did you talk to me?

628
01:12:06,475 --> 01:12:08,444
You talked
through an associate.

629
01:12:08,445 --> 01:12:11,581
The one you just had killed.

630
01:12:11,582 --> 01:12:14,582
All my jobs went through him.

631
01:12:14,583 --> 01:12:16,883
All except the last one.

632
01:12:20,724 --> 01:12:22,792
You have to believe me.

633
01:12:24,005 --> 01:12:26,530
I had no idea.

634
01:12:26,531 --> 01:12:29,558
The day we've meet
and fell in love...

635
01:12:29,559 --> 01:12:32,459
you killed my father.

636
01:12:34,759 --> 01:12:36,759
Break.

637
01:12:44,081 --> 01:12:47,509
- I know now what he meant.
- What?

638
01:12:48,704 --> 01:12:55,219
Your father... his final word
was... Break.

639
01:12:58,798 --> 01:13:02,326
He's last thoughts were
listening to you sing.

640
01:13:12,049 --> 01:13:14,549
Let's toast...

641
01:13:16,250 --> 01:13:20,550
To life, with all of it's whoa's
and malice.

642
01:13:20,651 --> 01:13:24,151
Some you see coming,
some you don't.

643
01:13:38,774 --> 01:13:42,833
You're not drinking, Frank?
You think I'd poison you?

644
01:13:43,234 --> 01:13:44,901
Give me some credit.

645
01:13:44,902 --> 01:13:47,570
That's your specialty.

646
01:13:47,917 --> 01:13:51,314
You won't interfere
with our lives.

647
01:13:51,715 --> 01:13:55,415
You won't interfere
in anyone’s life ever again.

648
01:13:59,294 --> 01:14:01,826
What'd you do to me?

649
01:14:04,327 --> 01:14:06,627
Your drink.

650
01:14:08,103 --> 01:14:10,828
You should always
keep an eye on your drink.

651
01:14:12,541 --> 01:14:15,299
You son of a bitch!

652
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:20,300
No...
You're the son of a bitch!

653
01:14:21,917 --> 01:14:27,244
Because of you, she lost her father
and I nearly lost her.

654
01:14:28,961 --> 01:14:31,461
Without me,
you'll never make it.

655
01:14:33,562 --> 01:14:38,799
Without me,
you got no career.

656
01:14:39,171 --> 01:14:47,044
I was there that night,
at her show. her very first show.

657
01:14:47,045 --> 01:14:51,005
That was enough for me to know,
that she had a career.

658
01:14:51,006 --> 01:14:53,585
Your problem is...

659
01:14:53,586 --> 01:14:57,278
you spend to much time looking
and not enough time listening.

660
01:15:00,626 --> 01:15:01,627
Your question is,

660
01:15:01,628 --> 01:15:04,587
you never really heard
the magic of her.

661
01:15:32,029 --> 01:15:38,020
If you could go back and do it again,
would you still go through with it?

662
01:15:42,822 --> 01:15:44,422
Yes.

663
01:15:47,642 --> 01:15:52,270
The one thing my father wanted more
then anything, was for me to be happy.

664
01:15:54,715 --> 01:15:57,108
You promised
to continue making me happy...

665
01:15:57,109 --> 01:16:00,408
is what you can give
back to him.

666
01:16:03,625 --> 01:16:06,617
Well, that's a promise
I can never break.

667
01:16:11,100 --> 01:16:16,831
To never eating alone,
and singing to an almost empty Bar.

668
01:16:19,175 --> 01:16:21,934
And to a promise,
that will never be broken.
