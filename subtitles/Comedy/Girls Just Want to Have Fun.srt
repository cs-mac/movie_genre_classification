1
00:00:42,896 --> 00:00:44,774
I don't know where to begin.

2
00:00:49,528 --> 00:00:50,848
Let's see.

3
00:00:54,116 --> 00:00:56,233
This is so embarrassing.

4
00:01:02,374 --> 00:01:04,650
I don't know,
I guess I'm pretty borring.

5
00:01:13,177 --> 00:01:14,930
Please, class.

6
00:01:15,095 --> 00:01:17,769
Show our new student a little courtesy.

7
00:01:17,973 --> 00:01:21,091
Just tell us a little
about yourself, Janey.

8
00:01:23,354 --> 00:01:25,789
I hiccup when I get nervous.

9
00:01:25,981 --> 00:01:27,700
So we've learned.

10
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:30,290
Jane, why don't you tell us
where you're from?

11
00:01:30,486 --> 00:01:32,364
Everywhere.

12
00:01:32,529 --> 00:01:36,000
I mean, my dad's in the army
or at least he was until he retired,

13
00:01:36,241 --> 00:01:38,597
so we were always moving.

14
00:01:38,786 --> 00:01:41,585
This is the eleventh school
that I've been to.

15
00:01:44,166 --> 00:01:47,284
Eleven different schools
but the uniform is always the same.

16
00:01:47,503 --> 00:01:49,779
Even on Guam.

17
00:01:49,963 --> 00:01:51,602
Chicago's really going
to have to do it's fair

18
00:01:51,757 --> 00:01:54,397
share to impress
a seasoned traveler like you.

19
00:01:54,593 --> 00:01:58,507
Tell us about your hobbies,
outside interests.

20
00:01:58,764 --> 00:01:59,959
Let's see what do I like to do.

21
00:02:00,099 --> 00:02:06,653
I, I like listening to music.

22
00:02:07,022 --> 00:02:10,982
And I like doing gymnastics.

23
00:02:13,278 --> 00:02:15,713
And I love to dance.

24
00:02:16,865 --> 00:02:19,983
Army bases are pretty dead
unless you're in the army.

25
00:02:20,202 --> 00:02:22,592
So I always had a lot
of time to daydream.

26
00:02:22,788 --> 00:02:25,860
And my daydream was always the same:

27
00:02:26,083 --> 00:02:30,123
that someday I was gonna get to Chicago,

28
00:02:30,379 --> 00:02:33,531
because that's
where they make Dance-TV.

29
00:02:34,049 --> 00:02:35,563
Live from Chicago,

30
00:02:35,718 --> 00:02:37,789
America's Number One Dance Show.

31
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:40,804
Dance-TV is on the air.

32
00:04:28,956 --> 00:04:31,755
Hi, I'm Gary Woods,
and welcome to Dance-TV.

33
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:33,951
We have an incredible show
for you tonight,

34
00:04:34,128 --> 00:04:36,848
so stay with us as
we bring you one solid hour filled

35
00:04:37,047 --> 00:04:38,800
with your favorite hits.

36
00:04:38,966 --> 00:04:40,639
We'll have world premiere videos.

37
00:04:40,801 --> 00:04:42,918
The last music news from Ricky.

38
00:04:43,095 --> 00:04:45,690
And wayout dancing from
our DTV regulars

39
00:04:45,889 --> 00:04:47,084
who could burn down any house.

40
00:04:47,224 --> 00:04:48,977
So grab your fire extinguishers.

41
00:04:49,143 --> 00:04:50,338
Turn the TV up.

42
00:04:50,477 --> 00:04:53,311
It's DTV time.

43
00:05:14,209 --> 00:05:15,962
Would you cover for me?

44
00:05:19,423 --> 00:05:20,539
Just hold your blazer open.

45
00:05:20,674 --> 00:05:21,664
Like this?

46
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,678
- This got it?
- Yeah, thanks.

47
00:05:24,803 --> 00:05:26,522
Oh, my god!

48
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:32,016
Thanks.

49
00:05:35,814 --> 00:05:37,009
It's Velcro.

50
00:05:37,149 --> 00:05:38,026
Next to the Walkman and Tab,

51
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:41,222
it is the coolest invention
in the 20th Century.

52
00:05:42,196 --> 00:05:43,232
My name's Lynne Stone.

53
00:05:43,364 --> 00:05:44,002
Hi.

54
00:05:44,156 --> 00:05:46,512
And I'm going to change
it as soon as I'm old enough.

55
00:05:47,076 --> 00:05:47,554
Why are you doing this?

56
00:05:47,659 --> 00:05:49,093
Do you have a date or something?

57
00:05:49,244 --> 00:05:50,360
No, I wish.

58
00:05:50,496 --> 00:05:52,328
I just know I must be horny.

59
00:05:52,498 --> 00:05:53,295
I'm going to babysit.

60
00:05:53,415 --> 00:05:55,452
You should see me when I go out.

61
00:05:58,045 --> 00:06:00,355
What's the matter?

62
00:06:00,547 --> 00:06:02,664
Oh, I know, you're gonna miss
the beginning of Dance TV.

63
00:06:02,841 --> 00:06:03,479
Yeah, well never mind.

64
00:06:03,592 --> 00:06:05,390
I'm used to missing things.

65
00:06:07,888 --> 00:06:09,288
Well, get over it.

66
00:06:09,431 --> 00:06:11,468
I'm not going to let you miss anything.

67
00:06:11,934 --> 00:06:13,971
She's got a twenty-five inch TV.

68
00:06:14,144 --> 00:06:15,100
- Oh, excuse me.
- Come on.

69
00:06:15,229 --> 00:06:16,026
And you're sure she'll drive me home?

70
00:06:16,146 --> 00:06:16,863
No problem.

71
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:19,176
I tell you, this woman loves me.

72
00:06:22,444 --> 00:06:24,356
Okay, here we are.

73
00:06:25,155 --> 00:06:27,465
Okay, it just ate,
don't feed her anything.

74
00:06:27,658 --> 00:06:28,455
- Okay.
- Be back at six.

75
00:06:28,575 --> 00:06:30,567
- Okay.
- And write down all phone messages.

76
00:06:30,744 --> 00:06:31,222
You bet.

77
00:06:31,328 --> 00:06:33,206
- Okay, bye-bye.
- Bye.

78
00:06:37,835 --> 00:06:41,033
My little Lemsky.

79
00:06:41,255 --> 00:06:45,647
A.Q. Lemsky, this is Janey.

80
00:06:45,926 --> 00:06:47,645
Janey, stinky.

81
00:06:47,803 --> 00:06:50,113
That's Janey.

82
00:06:50,305 --> 00:06:51,659
Hi.

83
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:10,997
I'll be right back.

84
00:07:11,118 --> 00:07:12,108
Okay.

85
00:07:13,287 --> 00:07:16,007
Jonathan and Lisa are my favorite couple.

86
00:07:16,206 --> 00:07:18,118
You know, his birthday
is the same as mine, almost.

87
00:07:18,292 --> 00:07:20,204
Do you remember when he kissed
her on the New Year's Eve show?

88
00:07:20,377 --> 00:07:21,094
Yes.

89
00:07:21,211 --> 00:07:22,645
They were frenching.

90
00:07:24,798 --> 00:07:26,710
Afterwards he wipes
his mouth off, like this.

91
00:07:26,884 --> 00:07:28,716
It was a dead giveaway.

92
00:07:32,431 --> 00:07:34,548
That's our D-TV dancers.

93
00:07:34,725 --> 00:07:36,557
And how would you like
to become one of them?

94
00:07:36,727 --> 00:07:38,081
Well, now's your chance because

95
00:07:38,228 --> 00:07:42,700
we're having a contest
to find a new DTV regular couple.

96
00:07:42,983 --> 00:07:43,860
You wanna join us?

97
00:07:43,984 --> 00:07:44,735
Well, you can.

98
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:48,171
All you have to do is come on out
and audition this Friday.

99
00:07:48,405 --> 00:07:50,715
We're going to narrow
it down to seven couples.

100
00:07:50,908 --> 00:07:52,900
And then have a grand final dance off,

101
00:07:53,077 --> 00:07:56,912
right here on our Saturday show,
live on DTV.

102
00:07:57,164 --> 00:07:59,599
Now write this information down.

103
00:08:06,298 --> 00:08:08,176
I can't believe you missed it.

104
00:08:09,968 --> 00:08:10,765
Missed what?

105
00:08:10,886 --> 00:08:12,320
The big DTV news, that's what.

106
00:08:12,471 --> 00:08:13,825
They announced the contest today,

107
00:08:13,972 --> 00:08:17,124
which my own personal
sources told me about a week ago.

108
00:08:18,227 --> 00:08:19,456
What kinda contest?

109
00:08:19,603 --> 00:08:21,560
For a new regular couple
to dance on the show.

110
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:23,642
This could be our big break.

111
00:08:23,816 --> 00:08:25,569
Hey, Drew,
I told you I won't dance with you.

112
00:08:25,734 --> 00:08:26,167
Your palms sweat.

113
00:08:26,276 --> 00:08:27,505
Very funny. I'm telling you, man,

114
00:08:27,653 --> 00:08:30,964
you got the stuff it takes to win
that contest and on TV.

115
00:08:31,782 --> 00:08:34,138
Oh yeah, I'm a definite TV star.

116
00:08:34,326 --> 00:08:36,238
Me and Captain Kangaroo.

117
00:08:36,412 --> 00:08:38,927
Malene, I can't help it
if I'm a conceptual thinker.

118
00:08:39,123 --> 00:08:40,159
It's a curse.

119
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:44,489
But I just can't feature you starting
trade school right after graduation.

120
00:08:44,753 --> 00:08:47,313
Jeff Malene, machinist.

121
00:08:47,506 --> 00:08:49,020
I don't see it.

122
00:08:49,174 --> 00:08:51,814
Jeff Malene, regular on DTV.

123
00:08:52,011 --> 00:08:53,206
Oh, it's there. In neon.

124
00:08:53,345 --> 00:08:56,417
I don't need any dance contest
to tell me I'm a good dancer.

125
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,516
Hey, squirt...

126
00:09:00,728 --> 00:09:01,400
Don't call me squirt.

127
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,000
I'm not a little kid.

128
00:09:03,147 --> 00:09:04,706
No!

129
00:09:04,857 --> 00:09:06,814
I can't believe that you're
older than me.

130
00:09:06,984 --> 00:09:08,657
I'm older than you.

131
00:09:26,295 --> 00:09:28,287
Now let's take a little
break from the dancing right now

132
00:09:28,464 --> 00:09:31,696
for the latest music news from my girl,

133
00:09:31,925 --> 00:09:34,201
Now where is that Rikki?

134
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:39,570
Let's all hear it for steroids.

135
00:09:39,767 --> 00:09:41,565
And now the news.

136
00:09:41,727 --> 00:09:44,287
Did you see it last week
when Rikki roder in on a dog sled?

137
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,949
Oh, god he double's the coolest.

138
00:09:47,149 --> 00:09:48,822
Call House Records at Thatcher Arena,

139
00:09:48,984 --> 00:09:50,976
as their rock 'n roughage
victory tour continues

140
00:09:51,153 --> 00:09:53,622
to sweept through the English countryside.

141
00:09:53,822 --> 00:09:54,778
In other news,

142
00:09:54,907 --> 00:09:56,500
Paul McCartney
bought up the publishing right

143
00:09:56,658 --> 00:09:59,127
to all Locamotive sound effects tapes.

144
00:09:59,328 --> 00:10:00,364
Does this make Paul rich?

145
00:10:00,496 --> 00:10:02,727
But does it make him happy?

146
00:10:02,915 --> 00:10:04,110
No habla ingles.

147
00:10:04,249 --> 00:10:06,480
Well, we're almost out of time
but tune in tomorrow

148
00:10:06,669 --> 00:10:10,265
for a sneak preview
of seven more songs titled: Jump.

149
00:10:12,257 --> 00:10:14,249
Well, this is Rikki saying,

150
00:10:14,426 --> 00:10:16,782
no matter how hard you try,

151
00:10:17,388 --> 00:10:19,698
you'll never be as good as me.

152
00:10:20,474 --> 00:10:22,067
And remember win the contest

153
00:10:22,226 --> 00:10:25,139
and you'll be dancing the day
away on DTV

154
00:10:25,354 --> 00:10:27,073
But until then, for all of you out there,

155
00:10:27,231 --> 00:10:31,066
from all of us here, including Rikki
the DTV regulars, andme,

156
00:10:31,318 --> 00:10:31,910
Gary Woods.

157
00:10:32,027 --> 00:10:33,222
You have yourself a great one.

158
00:10:33,362 --> 00:10:37,242
We'll see you tomorrow
when DTV comes dancing back.

159
00:10:40,285 --> 00:10:42,083
That is the coolest.

160
00:10:43,205 --> 00:10:45,117
We're going to be on DTV.

161
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:47,043
Listen, I'm a pretty good dancer.

162
00:10:47,209 --> 00:10:49,360
But what I lack in substance,
I make up for in style.

163
00:10:49,545 --> 00:10:51,821
And you, This is you today.

164
00:10:52,631 --> 00:10:54,748
"I love to dance."

165
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:57,257
I mean, it was perfect.

166
00:10:58,095 --> 00:10:59,245
Look, I think you're forgetting that.

167
00:10:59,388 --> 00:11:01,539
I have General Patton as a father.

168
00:11:01,724 --> 00:11:05,604
But you belong on DTV,
and of course, so do I.

169
00:11:05,853 --> 00:11:07,207
We'll just audition, okay?

170
00:11:07,354 --> 00:11:08,390
We'll just, we 'II go and audition.

171
00:11:08,522 --> 00:11:11,435
Your dad can't find
anything wrong with that.

172
00:11:15,738 --> 00:11:18,458
Lemsky! What's going on here?

173
00:11:24,121 --> 00:11:26,511
I'm sorry, baby,
I'm in the middle of a board meeting.

174
00:11:26,707 --> 00:11:27,584
Now what's this all about?

175
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:29,222
I already told you.

176
00:11:29,376 --> 00:11:31,652
Why don't you listen for a change.

177
00:11:31,837 --> 00:11:33,396
Yes, baby I I do listen.

178
00:11:33,547 --> 00:11:34,583
I, I, I remember.

179
00:11:34,715 --> 00:11:36,547
You want to be on some kind
of a dance show, right?

180
00:11:36,717 --> 00:11:37,434
Yes, daddy.

181
00:11:37,551 --> 00:11:40,589
I'm going to star on Dance TV.

182
00:11:40,804 --> 00:11:43,194
Don't you think I deserve at least that?

183
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:45,780
But, but princess,
I thought we were working

184
00:11:45,976 --> 00:11:49,094
on that Seventeen magazine
modeling contest for you.

185
00:11:49,313 --> 00:11:50,588
My shrink is right.

186
00:11:50,731 --> 00:11:52,484
I'm unloved; unappreciated;

187
00:11:52,649 --> 00:11:53,765
I only have one car.

188
00:11:53,901 --> 00:11:56,780
That quack'll say anything
to keep the money rolling in!

189
00:11:56,987 --> 00:11:59,297
Aren't I giving you
a big coming-out party?

190
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:02,050
Don't try to buy my affections.

191
00:12:02,242 --> 00:12:03,596
I'm going to be on that show, dady

192
00:12:03,744 --> 00:12:06,976
and I don't want
to hear another word about it.

193
00:12:07,206 --> 00:12:08,879
Now you've made me late.

194
00:12:18,342 --> 00:12:20,220
Decisions are the worst.

195
00:12:25,224 --> 00:12:26,578
One phone call? One phone call.

196
00:12:26,725 --> 00:12:27,636
Mrs. Lemsky, my house my house.

197
00:12:27,768 --> 00:12:28,440
Now answer me, did the phone ring?

198
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,357
Did the phone ring or didn't it?

199
00:12:29,478 --> 00:12:31,071
Bye. Thanks for the ride.

200
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:32,505
- Did it?
- Yeah.

201
00:12:32,648 --> 00:12:34,480
- This is inexcusable.
- Bye.

202
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:36,562
Don't forget to ask your dad.

203
00:12:40,489 --> 00:12:41,718
Hi.

204
00:12:43,033 --> 00:12:45,184
I like dogs, yeah. Benji.

205
00:12:45,369 --> 00:12:47,804
Boomer! Sandy!

206
00:12:47,997 --> 00:12:49,477
Oh, God!

207
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:53,370
I like a mad much.

208
00:13:00,884 --> 00:13:02,443
- Hello, honey.
- Hi.

209
00:13:02,594 --> 00:13:03,391
Hi.

210
00:13:03,512 --> 00:13:06,027
Mm, how was school?

211
00:13:06,348 --> 00:13:08,146
It was typical.

212
00:13:08,308 --> 00:13:09,378
But I made a new friend.

213
00:13:09,518 --> 00:13:09,917
You did.

214
00:13:10,019 --> 00:13:11,976
Well, that was fast.

215
00:13:12,354 --> 00:13:15,631
Yes. Listen, dad, could I talk
to you about something?

216
00:13:15,899 --> 00:13:17,538
Hi, sweetheart.

217
00:13:18,235 --> 00:13:20,704
We have met the enemy
and she has B.O.

218
00:13:20,904 --> 00:13:21,382
Zach.

219
00:13:21,488 --> 00:13:23,320
Come on, Zach, come here.

220
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:26,403
Let's wash the backyard off your face.

221
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:33,747
Listen, I was, I was wondering
about something.

222
00:13:33,917 --> 00:13:35,954
What's up?

223
00:13:36,128 --> 00:13:39,087
Well, see, there's this contest that
I really want to enter.

224
00:13:39,298 --> 00:13:41,449
A little healthy cometition,
it's good for the soul.

225
00:13:41,633 --> 00:13:42,589
That's the spirit.

226
00:13:42,718 --> 00:13:45,358
Well, see what I do is I go downtown
on Friday and I get to dance

227
00:13:45,554 --> 00:13:47,386
And then if they like me then
I rehearse evert night

228
00:13:47,556 --> 00:13:49,707
and then if I win
I'm going to be on TV, all right?

229
00:13:50,142 --> 00:13:50,814
Negative.

230
00:13:50,893 --> 00:13:52,373
Hey, I don't want you going all over

231
00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:54,192
this town before
I've done any reconnaissance.

232
00:13:54,355 --> 00:13:55,948
Chicago is a tough city.

233
00:13:56,106 --> 00:13:58,905
I've got to install,
an alarm system in this house.

234
00:13:59,109 --> 00:14:01,101
And B: you're too young
to go out at night

235
00:14:01,278 --> 00:14:03,918
except for the occasional
supervised school activities.

236
00:14:04,114 --> 00:14:06,583
When you're eighteen then
you're entitled to some nightlife

237
00:14:06,784 --> 00:14:08,457
Now we had a deal, remember?

238
00:14:08,619 --> 00:14:10,417
We made a deal when
I was seven and a half.

239
00:14:10,579 --> 00:14:12,218
"Nightlife" was The Muppet Show.

240
00:14:12,373 --> 00:14:13,648
Don't sass me.

241
00:14:13,791 --> 00:14:15,669
I'm sorry, sir.

242
00:14:16,835 --> 00:14:18,235
I'm doing this for your own good.

243
00:14:18,379 --> 00:14:19,495
Yeah, you forgot to say,

244
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:21,508
You'll thank me for this one day."

245
00:14:25,094 --> 00:14:27,814
And so I said, "Sister, please,
anybody could have comfuded.

246
00:14:28,013 --> 00:14:29,845
'Hail Mary' with 'Proud Mary',
and besides,

247
00:14:30,015 --> 00:14:32,814
I do a very good Tina Turner."

248
00:14:33,018 --> 00:14:33,656
What did she do?

249
00:14:33,769 --> 00:14:36,000
Made me wash all
of your blackboards, but that's okay,

250
00:14:36,188 --> 00:14:40,068
'cause I broke every piece
of her chalk into tiny little pieces.

251
00:14:40,317 --> 00:14:42,274
You know, you can't wear
that to the audition.

252
00:14:42,444 --> 00:14:43,844
I know.

253
00:14:43,987 --> 00:14:45,023
Are you backing out?

254
00:14:45,155 --> 00:14:46,509
Lynne, look, my father won't let me go

255
00:14:46,657 --> 00:14:48,250
and mymother says that
we have to let him win a few battles

256
00:14:48,409 --> 00:14:49,763
so we can win the war.

257
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:50,627
Whatever that means.

258
00:14:50,744 --> 00:14:51,860
That means you're going anyway.

259
00:14:51,996 --> 00:14:52,713
Lynne, I can't.

260
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:54,662
They won't let me go.

261
00:14:54,832 --> 00:14:56,869
Do you do everything you're told.

262
00:14:59,169 --> 00:15:00,842
Oh, god, you do.

263
00:15:01,005 --> 00:15:03,315
Uh look, there's your bus.

264
00:15:03,507 --> 00:15:04,179
Good luck, all right?

265
00:15:04,299 --> 00:15:05,938
And will you call me tonight?

266
00:15:06,385 --> 00:15:07,865
I'm sorry.

267
00:15:08,595 --> 00:15:10,552
I'm sorry, too.

268
00:15:10,723 --> 00:15:11,076
Bye.

269
00:15:11,181 --> 00:15:12,535
Bye.

270
00:15:35,164 --> 00:15:38,077
Oh, come on, come on,
you can do it, you can do it.

271
00:15:38,292 --> 00:15:39,692
Take my hand...

272
00:15:41,128 --> 00:15:43,199
It's all a matter of appearances.

273
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:46,737
If you show up at the audition
on a motorcycle, you're a wild kid.

274
00:15:47,009 --> 00:15:48,443
But if you tool up in a Mercedes,

275
00:15:48,594 --> 00:15:51,063
you're a man to be reckoned with.

276
00:15:51,263 --> 00:15:53,095
Drew, when are you gonna get rid
of this thing?

277
00:15:53,265 --> 00:15:54,062
That's your problem, Jeff.

278
00:15:54,183 --> 00:15:57,221
You don't understand
that this car makes a statement.

279
00:15:57,436 --> 00:15:59,712
Yeah. It says, "Hi, I'm garbaga."

280
00:16:06,153 --> 00:16:07,906
I love this car. I told you.

281
00:16:08,072 --> 00:16:10,189
It starts, it always starts.

282
00:16:10,366 --> 00:16:11,959
Yeah, but does it stop?

283
00:16:28,842 --> 00:16:30,799
This is so cool.

284
00:16:32,721 --> 00:16:33,632
This is a mob scene.

285
00:16:33,764 --> 00:16:35,118
You should have parked on the street.

286
00:16:35,265 --> 00:16:36,016
What are you talking about?

287
00:16:36,141 --> 00:16:37,700
There're a space right there.

288
00:16:41,063 --> 00:16:42,179
A parking place right in front.

289
00:16:42,314 --> 00:16:44,306
That's a good omen.

290
00:16:44,483 --> 00:16:47,715
I knew this was going to be cool
I know it. Come on.

291
00:16:47,945 --> 00:16:49,664
Let's do it.

292
00:16:49,822 --> 00:16:52,576
Ladie. Top of the morning to you.

293
00:16:53,325 --> 00:16:54,395
Smile, will ya?

294
00:16:54,535 --> 00:16:56,015
He may be dorky
but his friend's kinda cute,

295
00:16:56,161 --> 00:16:57,675
if your're into public school guys.

296
00:16:57,830 --> 00:16:58,946
Which I am.

297
00:16:59,081 --> 00:17:00,640
Come on.

298
00:17:00,791 --> 00:17:02,430
Let's go, everybody,
we got a T-shirt stampede.

299
00:17:02,584 --> 00:17:03,301

00:17:08,841 --> 00:17:11,310
Get your Dance TV shirts.

304
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:13,263

Lowest vender exits Right.

306
00:17:15,014 --> 00:17:15,891
Wait just a second.

307
00:17:16,015 --> 00:17:16,732
He can't do that.

308
00:17:16,849 --> 00:17:18,841
- That was my idea.
- Whoa whoa.

309
00:17:19,018 --> 00:17:21,897
Drew, I hate to break it to you,
man but all right.

310
00:17:22,104 --> 00:17:22,582
Okay.

311
00:17:22,688 --> 00:17:24,441
If, I'll, I'll wait
and sell them after the contest.

312
00:17:24,606 --> 00:17:27,121
I'll call them collector's items,
charge double.

313
00:17:27,735 --> 00:17:29,249
Hey, beautiful, stop looking.

314
00:17:29,403 --> 00:17:30,962
You've found me.

315
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,879
Great.

316
00:17:35,325 --> 00:17:36,122
That's nice going, Drew.

317
00:17:36,243 --> 00:17:37,359
I always wanted you for a brother in law.

318
00:17:37,494 --> 00:17:39,053
She's a punk.

319
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:43,270
Do you really think I'm a punk?

320
00:17:43,417 --> 00:17:44,533
Wow, that's outrageous.

321
00:17:44,668 --> 00:17:46,660
I mean, it's not as cool as New Wave,

322
00:17:46,837 --> 00:17:49,193
but it's a lot better than pre-teen.

323
00:17:49,923 --> 00:17:51,482
So do all women throw them
selves at your feet,

324
00:17:51,633 --> 00:17:53,784
ot is it just the ones
that can't reach any higher.

325
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,552
Come on, Romeo.

326
00:17:57,890 --> 00:18:02,521
All right let's move along here,
please, thank you.

327
00:18:03,854 --> 00:18:04,173
Yes.

328
00:18:04,271 --> 00:18:06,149
You don't remember me, do you?

329
00:18:07,191 --> 00:18:09,786
I haven't forgotten you or that smile.

330
00:18:10,611 --> 00:18:11,806
God, I'm sorry,
I'm not good with names.

331
00:18:11,945 --> 00:18:14,255
I must have forgotten who you...

332
00:18:14,448 --> 00:18:16,167
It's Jeff Malene.

333
00:18:16,367 --> 00:18:18,324
I'd given you up for dead.

334
00:18:18,869 --> 00:18:20,588
It's a nice uniform.

335
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:23,928
That's all right.

336
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:26,601
There are plenty of guys
who go nuts for girls in uniforms.

337
00:18:26,794 --> 00:18:28,433
Name two.

338
00:18:28,879 --> 00:18:31,110
Your father and Captain Kirk.

339
00:18:31,298 --> 00:18:32,573
I know I'm going to die.

340
00:18:32,716 --> 00:18:33,706
Hi, I'm Lynne Stone.

341
00:18:33,842 --> 00:18:34,798
My lucky Carol hands her number 87.

342
00:18:34,927 --> 00:18:36,566
Next.

343
00:18:37,262 --> 00:18:39,060
I have a real way with author-Carol
hands number 35 to Janey.

344
00:18:39,223 --> 00:18:40,100
Somebody.

345
00:18:40,224 --> 00:18:41,294
Thank you.

346
00:18:41,975 --> 00:18:43,773
All right...

347
00:18:46,063 --> 00:18:47,292
Look out!

348
00:18:49,775 --> 00:18:50,970
Are you okay?

349
00:18:56,156 --> 00:18:57,636
Sorry.

350
00:18:58,742 --> 00:18:59,971
Lynne.

351
00:19:02,496 --> 00:19:04,931
Lynne. Lynne.

352
00:19:17,136 --> 00:19:18,650
Think it looks all right?

353
00:19:20,931 --> 00:19:22,251
Thanks, bitch.

354
00:19:24,226 --> 00:19:25,740
Nice car.

355
00:19:26,186 --> 00:19:28,462
I've got exotic wheels myself.

356
00:19:28,939 --> 00:19:31,534
What is it, a Schwinn ten-speed?

357
00:19:33,527 --> 00:19:34,199
Yeah.

358
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:37,630
All right. Now, are we ready.

359
00:19:40,451 --> 00:19:41,487
All right.

360
00:19:41,618 --> 00:19:42,495
If we could have please thank you,

361
00:19:42,953 --> 00:19:45,513
if we could have
the first group up on stage.

362
00:19:45,706 --> 00:19:48,426
If you don't have a partner,
don't worry about it.

363
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:50,139
We'll pair you up.

364
00:19:50,294 --> 00:19:51,808
We just want to see you dance.

365
00:19:51,962 --> 00:19:52,839
All right?

366
00:19:52,963 --> 00:19:55,478
So let the games begin.

367
00:20:15,736 --> 00:20:17,932
I want you and, and I want you.

368
00:20:18,113 --> 00:20:21,231
Yes, okay I want both of you...

369
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:22,008
Good luck.

370
00:20:22,117 --> 00:20:24,677
All right, let's move it along thank you.

371
00:21:38,444 --> 00:21:39,878
Could we move it along?

372
00:21:40,029 --> 00:21:41,383
Thank you.

373
00:22:00,966 --> 00:22:02,320
Oh, my god.

374
00:22:02,926 --> 00:22:04,645
Cut them.

375
00:22:25,199 --> 00:22:27,350
That's good. See that?

376
00:22:51,141 --> 00:22:52,370

00:24:35,579 --> 00:24:37,536
Thank you very much.

394
00:24:39,917 --> 00:24:43,035
You you showd lots of orginality.

395
00:24:43,253 --> 00:24:44,812
Thank you.

396
00:24:46,924 --> 00:24:48,802
Okay, now we'd like
to pair up the contestants...

397
00:24:48,967 --> 00:24:50,083
Way to go, Jeff.

398
00:24:50,219 --> 00:24:51,414
We've chosen so far.

399
00:24:51,553 --> 00:24:53,909
Be patient, I'll be right back.

400
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:55,596
All right, now,

401
00:24:55,724 --> 00:24:57,363
I'd like to make a few changes.

402
00:24:57,518 --> 00:24:59,828
Miss excuse me,

403
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:01,852
Miss right here.

404
00:25:02,022 --> 00:25:04,742
I'd like to see you
with the big fella there, please.

405
00:25:04,942 --> 00:25:06,695
Yes, yes, you.

406
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:08,135
Thank you.

407
00:25:09,571 --> 00:25:11,290
My you are bih.

408
00:25:11,448 --> 00:25:12,564
Yes, well that's lovely.

409
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:14,134
All right, thank you very much.

410
00:25:14,284 --> 00:25:15,957
If you would please.

411
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:18,032
Yeah, no, no, no, wat, no, no.

412
00:25:18,205 --> 00:25:20,003
This, this is not right.

413
00:25:20,749 --> 00:25:22,502
You two back together again, please.

414
00:25:22,668 --> 00:25:23,863
Uh, yes, yes, switch, please.

415
00:25:24,003 --> 00:25:24,720
There we are.

416
00:25:24,837 --> 00:25:26,191
There we are. Very good.

417
00:25:26,338 --> 00:25:27,658
There, that's fine.

418
00:25:27,798 --> 00:25:28,515
Yes, that's good.

419
00:25:28,632 --> 00:25:29,907
Well, I like this. Yes.

420
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:31,803
Sort of "Revel Without a Caouse"

421
00:25:31,969 --> 00:25:34,006
meets "Sound of Music."

422
00:25:35,139 --> 00:25:37,176
You're taking a fashion risk.

423
00:25:37,349 --> 00:25:38,908
I like that.

424
00:25:39,518 --> 00:25:41,396
Just don't do it on camera.

425
00:25:41,562 --> 00:25:43,394
All right, remember to pick up
the list of rehearsal times.

426
00:25:43,564 --> 00:25:44,281
What are you doing,

427
00:25:44,398 --> 00:25:47,470
I no, I want to take just one of those.

428
00:25:48,569 --> 00:25:50,162
You looked great.

429
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,152
Lynne, this is a drag. I'm sorry.

430
00:25:52,323 --> 00:25:52,801
It's all right.

431
00:25:52,906 --> 00:25:53,783
Did you catch my dance partner?

432
00:25:53,907 --> 00:25:56,502
That wasn't dancing,
that was assault and battery.

433
00:25:56,702 --> 00:25:58,898
There he is with that cheese bum.

434
00:26:00,914 --> 00:26:02,553
Lynne, she set this up.

435
00:26:02,708 --> 00:26:05,542
- We're going to tell Ira, okay?
- No, wait, forget it.

436
00:26:05,753 --> 00:26:07,585
You know what's better than getting mad?

437
00:26:07,755 --> 00:26:09,155
Getting even.

438
00:26:12,926 --> 00:26:13,882
Did you get her number?

439
00:26:14,011 --> 00:26:14,967
Yeah, Zero.

440
00:26:15,095 --> 00:26:17,530
Hey, what's the Flying Nun's
phone number.

441
00:26:17,723 --> 00:26:19,282
It's unlisted.

442
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:23,537
555-4102.

443
00:26:25,356 --> 00:26:26,233
I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings.

444
00:26:26,357 --> 00:26:28,428
I didn't mean to.

445
00:26:28,609 --> 00:26:29,406
You looked great today.

446
00:26:29,526 --> 00:26:31,085
You sure fooled Drew.

447
00:26:31,236 --> 00:26:33,114
Anybody could fool him.

448
00:26:33,822 --> 00:26:37,941
You know, last year I caught him
undressing my Barbie doll.

449
00:26:38,994 --> 00:26:40,667
Am I ever going to grow up?

450
00:26:40,829 --> 00:26:42,058
Maggie, you're twelve.

451
00:26:42,206 --> 00:26:44,163
Next October you'll be thirteen
and then you'll be fourteen

452
00:26:44,333 --> 00:26:45,767
and that's the way it goes.

453
00:26:46,293 --> 00:26:48,603
I don't mean age.

454
00:26:49,755 --> 00:26:51,747
I mean women stuff.

455
00:26:53,467 --> 00:26:54,947
Don't make fun.

456
00:26:55,094 --> 00:26:57,814
Mom never got to that part.

457
00:26:58,013 --> 00:27:00,164
Well, I don't know who's going
to explainn it to you now?

458
00:27:00,349 --> 00:27:01,066
I mean, Dad's no good.

459
00:27:01,183 --> 00:27:04,062
All he told me was
"Don't be embarrassed, son,

460
00:27:04,269 --> 00:27:06,386
and just don't read Playboy
before you go to bed.

461
00:27:06,563 --> 00:27:07,155
Hi.

462
00:27:07,272 --> 00:27:08,183
Hi, Pop.

463
00:27:08,315 --> 00:27:10,591
I take it supper's ready?

464
00:27:11,276 --> 00:27:13,233
Hi, Meg.

465
00:27:13,404 --> 00:27:15,316
So how's work, Pop?

466
00:27:16,365 --> 00:27:19,278
Positively stimulating, as usual.

467
00:27:19,868 --> 00:27:21,541
I take it that's for me?

468
00:27:21,704 --> 00:27:22,342
Absolutely.

469
00:27:22,454 --> 00:27:23,729
Thanks.

470
00:27:23,872 --> 00:27:25,545
You're not too tired, are you, dad?

471
00:27:25,708 --> 00:27:26,505
Again?

472
00:27:26,625 --> 00:27:27,820
You broke it again?

473
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:28,757
I didn't break it.

474
00:27:28,877 --> 00:27:30,550
It just sorta fell off.

475
00:27:30,713 --> 00:27:33,273
Mags, I don't understand
how that doorknob keeps coming off.

476
00:27:33,465 --> 00:27:36,776
I mean, that's the fourth time
this month, you know.

477
00:27:37,011 --> 00:27:38,684
Thank you Lord for this food.

478
00:27:38,846 --> 00:27:39,882
She dance with it.

479
00:27:40,014 --> 00:27:41,448
What?

480
00:27:41,598 --> 00:27:44,636
So when I finally get asked to dance,
I'll know what to do.

481
00:27:44,852 --> 00:27:45,968
My sister dances with doors.

482
00:27:46,103 --> 00:27:47,617
She's the original slam dancer.

483
00:27:47,771 --> 00:27:49,364
He should talk, daddy.

484
00:27:49,523 --> 00:27:51,116
He's going to dance on T.V.

485
00:27:51,275 --> 00:27:52,789
Maggie!

486
00:27:52,943 --> 00:27:54,582
Care to clue me in?

487
00:27:57,031 --> 00:27:58,863
I auditioned for a dance contest.

488
00:27:59,033 --> 00:28:01,070
And he made the finals.

489
00:28:02,828 --> 00:28:05,297
And then they choose the winners on DTV.

490
00:28:05,497 --> 00:28:06,567
Well, what's the priZe?

491
00:28:06,707 --> 00:28:09,586
He's going to be a regular on Dance TV.

492
00:28:10,753 --> 00:28:12,949
What's this got to do with trade school?

493
00:28:14,923 --> 00:28:19,475
Look you don't want college,
well that's okay with me but

494
00:28:19,762 --> 00:28:22,152
I, I was in a hurry to get going
when I was your age, too.

495
00:28:22,348 --> 00:28:24,783
But you gotta have the skill, Jeff.

496
00:28:24,975 --> 00:28:27,251
You gotta start earning
a living sooner or later.

497
00:28:27,436 --> 00:28:29,029
Look, trade school was good
enough for my father

498
00:28:29,188 --> 00:28:31,305
and it was good enough for me.

499
00:28:32,858 --> 00:28:34,577
It's not funny.

500
00:28:34,735 --> 00:28:36,727
Don't throw a mental, Dad.

501
00:28:37,946 --> 00:28:41,178
I liked it better
when you kids used to humor me.

502
00:28:43,619 --> 00:28:45,576
Hold my calls.

503
00:28:49,416 --> 00:28:50,770
Affirmative.

504
00:28:50,918 --> 00:28:53,069
The credit card does work
on the bathroom lock.

505
00:28:53,253 --> 00:28:54,243
Zachary, you're a pervert.

506
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:55,450
Will you get out of here.

507
00:28:55,589 --> 00:28:57,740
Telephone. It's a boy.

508
00:28:57,925 --> 00:28:59,518
Want Dad to take a massage?

509
00:28:59,677 --> 00:29:01,714
I still can't write, you know.

510
00:29:09,019 --> 00:29:10,533
Hi.

511
00:29:10,688 --> 00:29:13,283
God, I can't believe you
remembered my phone number.

512
00:29:14,358 --> 00:29:14,916
You still have homework to do,

513
00:29:15,025 --> 00:29:16,220
- young lady.
- Hold on a second.

514
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,714
- Yeah,
- Who is it?

515
00:29:17,861 --> 00:29:19,739
It's, it's my friend, Lynne.

516
00:29:19,905 --> 00:29:22,943
Lynne? Oh, great.

517
00:29:23,659 --> 00:29:24,536
Well, make it short.

518
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:26,538
I'll just I'll be a secound.

519
00:29:28,914 --> 00:29:29,631
Hi, I'm back.

520
00:29:29,748 --> 00:29:31,740
Look, meet me at rehearsal
hall at nine o'clock.

521
00:29:31,917 --> 00:29:32,953
I'll bring the music.

522
00:29:33,085 --> 00:29:34,485
Hey, watch out!

523
00:29:34,628 --> 00:29:35,948
Bye.

524
00:29:36,088 --> 00:29:37,727
I don't know if I can...

525
00:29:43,887 --> 00:29:45,606
Sorry, I needed the phone.

526
00:29:45,764 --> 00:29:48,563
What for? Are the Cabbage Patch
mothers having a PTA meeting?

527
00:29:48,767 --> 00:29:50,121
You're cranky.

528
00:29:50,269 --> 00:29:53,945
Whenever Emily Holland's brother
is cranky it means a girl dumped him.

529
00:29:54,189 --> 00:29:55,384
You wanna get dumped.

530
00:29:55,524 --> 00:29:57,880
- I'll dump you.
- No! Dad!

531
00:30:03,782 --> 00:30:05,011
Enger.

532
00:30:05,784 --> 00:30:07,218
Just checking.
How about a little status report.

533
00:30:07,369 --> 00:30:08,485
Algebra.

534
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:09,497
Almost done.

535
00:30:09,621 --> 00:30:10,259
English?

536
00:30:10,372 --> 00:30:11,249
One chapter left.

537
00:30:11,373 --> 00:30:12,170
Biology?

538
00:30:12,291 --> 00:30:13,008
Finished.

539
00:30:13,125 --> 00:30:13,797
History?

540
00:30:13,917 --> 00:30:15,317
No homework.

541
00:30:15,461 --> 00:30:17,657
Say, you up to the French
Indian war yet?

542
00:30:18,255 --> 00:30:20,895
Boy, what a little light artillery
could've done there.

543
00:30:21,091 --> 00:30:22,411
Well, I knew you'd have it under control.

544
00:30:22,551 --> 00:30:23,428
Lights out at ten sharp.

545
00:30:23,552 --> 00:30:24,702
Good night, honey.

546
00:30:51,246 --> 00:30:52,760
All one?

547
00:30:54,416 --> 00:30:57,375
You ever want to practice you moves,
give me a call.

548
00:31:15,521 --> 00:31:16,796
First it was in my bedroom,

549
00:31:16,939 --> 00:31:18,532
then it was 7-11 by your house.

550
00:31:18,691 --> 00:31:19,807
Then it was in George's English class.

551
00:31:19,942 --> 00:31:22,502
Only in this dream sometimes
she wants to listen to George.

552
00:31:22,695 --> 00:31:23,412
She was that J.B.

553
00:31:23,529 --> 00:31:25,282
cheerleader who had the almost
see through underpants.

554
00:31:25,447 --> 00:31:27,882
Drew, can you be quiet for two seconds.

555
00:31:28,075 --> 00:31:29,395
Yeah, sure.

556
00:31:29,535 --> 00:31:30,730
You probably mean more
than two secounds,

557
00:31:30,869 --> 00:31:32,144
I mean, two seconds is like nothing.

558
00:31:32,287 --> 00:31:34,483
One, two, there, that's two seconds.

559
00:31:38,168 --> 00:31:39,488
I hate it when you're in a bad mood.

560
00:31:39,628 --> 00:31:40,823
I'm not in a bad mood.

561
00:31:40,963 --> 00:31:42,397
Sweetheart, when are you
going to buy yourself a nice

562
00:31:42,548 --> 00:31:44,301
sexy Catholic school uniform?

563
00:31:44,466 --> 00:31:47,459
Hey, get off my case, all right?

564
00:31:48,137 --> 00:31:49,730
Come on, Patty, we're not wanted.

565
00:31:49,888 --> 00:31:51,163
Not so fast.

566
00:31:51,306 --> 00:31:53,377
Patty and I have a little
business to attend to.

567
00:31:53,559 --> 00:31:55,073
The term papers are in.

568
00:31:55,227 --> 00:31:57,219
Eisen hower, Johnson, Kennedy.

569
00:31:57,396 --> 00:31:59,194
Kennedy. Oh, he was so cute.

570
00:31:59,356 --> 00:32:00,028
How much?

571
00:32:00,149 --> 00:32:00,707
A date with me.

572
00:32:00,816 --> 00:32:02,296
I'll take Johnson.

573
00:32:04,236 --> 00:32:06,353
Hey, I heard those Catholic
school girls really put out.

574
00:32:06,530 --> 00:32:08,840
Hey, hey, Jeff's very touchy this morning.

575
00:32:09,033 --> 00:32:11,548
He just've had a rough night breaking
in his new dance partner.

576
00:32:11,744 --> 00:32:13,178
Yeah, that's what you think.

577
00:32:13,329 --> 00:32:13,887
He didn't even see her.

578
00:32:13,996 --> 00:32:15,396
She stood him up.

579
00:33:02,461 --> 00:33:07,741
There is a time and a place
for calypso music, young lady.

580
00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:11,760
Open your ymnals to page 57.

581
00:33:12,721 --> 00:33:16,158
We will now sing "amazing Grace."

582
00:33:16,392 --> 00:33:16,984
What page?

583
00:33:17,101 --> 00:33:20,219
Lynne Stone will join us.

584
00:33:20,437 --> 00:33:23,509
Ans sing it like an American.

585
00:33:28,362 --> 00:33:31,116
I waited out there
for an hour and a half.

586
00:33:31,323 --> 00:33:34,714
I tried to tell you that I couldn't go,
but you hung up too fast.

587
00:33:46,046 --> 00:33:47,082
Are you going to do homework now?

588
00:33:47,214 --> 00:33:48,694
That's terrific.

589
00:33:49,842 --> 00:33:52,232
For your information I've just made
some notes about some steps

590
00:33:52,428 --> 00:33:54,738
in case there's some thing you can't do.

591
00:33:54,930 --> 00:33:57,047
I can do any step that you can do.

592
00:33:57,516 --> 00:33:58,552
Really?

593
00:33:58,684 --> 00:34:01,438
Because I was thinking
we'd start out with something like this.

594
00:34:11,864 --> 00:34:13,423
A little babyish, don't you think?

595
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:15,633
Babyish?

596
00:34:15,784 --> 00:34:17,855
Look, I've been taking gymnastice
and dance for ten years.

597
00:34:18,037 --> 00:34:19,676
What did you have in mind?

598
00:34:21,457 --> 00:34:25,007
Well, I thought we could start out
with something like this.

599
00:34:29,089 --> 00:34:30,205
Yeah.

600
00:34:30,341 --> 00:34:33,220
I saw that on three different videos
and a Levi's commercial.

601
00:34:33,427 --> 00:34:34,622
Come here.

602
00:34:38,599 --> 00:34:39,953
Go like this.

603
00:34:40,476 --> 00:34:43,514
Five, six, seven, eight.

604
00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:52,390
It's good.

605
00:34:52,529 --> 00:34:54,441
Okay, come back to me not.

606
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:56,196
I'm just gong to spin your out

607
00:34:56,325 --> 00:34:58,157
and I want you to come back
to me, all right?

608
00:34:58,327 --> 00:34:59,727
Out and back.

609
00:35:00,412 --> 00:35:02,449
Ooops. Back.

610
00:35:02,623 --> 00:35:04,421
Come back to me.

611
00:35:04,583 --> 00:35:06,256
Are you always going
to wear that uniform?

612
00:35:06,418 --> 00:35:07,374
Look, I've got news for you.

613
00:35:07,503 --> 00:35:09,335
I had to sneak out of choir practice
to get here, all right?

614
00:35:09,505 --> 00:35:11,098
It wasn't easy and it wasn't fun.

615
00:35:11,256 --> 00:35:12,929
Excuse me.

616
00:35:13,801 --> 00:35:16,555
Do either one of you have change
for a twenty?

617
00:35:16,762 --> 00:35:19,755
Gosh, I don't have anything
smaller than fifty.

618
00:35:20,474 --> 00:35:21,794
Sorry.

619
00:35:22,893 --> 00:35:25,488
My lose. Have fun.

620
00:35:27,648 --> 00:35:28,559
Look, we're wasting time, all right.

621
00:35:28,691 --> 00:35:30,410
Let's get back to work.

622
00:35:31,443 --> 00:35:32,797
Okay.

623
00:35:32,945 --> 00:35:34,061
This is Mr. Glenn.

624
00:35:34,196 --> 00:35:34,993
Yes.

625
00:35:35,114 --> 00:35:37,151
This is Sister Natalie.

626
00:35:37,324 --> 00:35:38,724
Do you know where Janey is?

627
00:35:38,867 --> 00:35:40,381
No, I thought she was in school.

628
00:35:41,161 --> 00:35:44,120
No no, she's not here.

629
00:35:44,331 --> 00:35:47,927
Please tell her if she can't make
it regularly to choir,

630
00:35:48,168 --> 00:35:50,160
I'll have to replace her.

631
00:35:50,337 --> 00:35:52,647
Well, I'll talk to her this evening, Sister.

632
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:53,717
Thank you.

633
00:35:53,841 --> 00:35:56,197
You're welcome. Thank you.

634
00:36:03,642 --> 00:36:05,315
Just keep going around.

635
00:36:05,477 --> 00:36:06,467
Will you stop showing off.

636
00:36:06,603 --> 00:36:08,913
We're supposed to be partners,
or did you forget?

637
00:36:09,106 --> 00:36:10,256
I wish I could forget.

638
00:36:10,399 --> 00:36:11,276
Oh, really?

639
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,915
Because, you know, if you
want to quit this, it's okay with me.

640
00:36:20,573 --> 00:36:21,973
What's the matter with him?

641
00:36:23,326 --> 00:36:24,601
I hate him.

642
00:36:24,744 --> 00:36:25,780
He's a guy and he's alive.

643
00:36:25,911 --> 00:36:27,265
What's there to hate?

644
00:36:27,413 --> 00:36:30,212
He's just, you know?

645
00:36:30,416 --> 00:36:32,487
I mean, oh...

646
00:36:32,668 --> 00:36:34,102
Well, good.
I like those qualities in a man.

647
00:36:34,253 --> 00:36:35,528
You know, I've been locked
up in a room with him

648
00:36:35,671 --> 00:36:38,470
for over an hour and let me tell you,
it was hiddous.

649
00:36:38,674 --> 00:36:39,869
Is he going to call you tomorrow?

650
00:36:40,009 --> 00:36:41,489
Yeah, I think so.

651
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,710
I'm holding this for ransom.

652
00:37:00,112 --> 00:37:02,911
Did you and Shirley Temple
have a bad rehearsal?

653
00:37:03,115 --> 00:37:06,711
Yeah, it wasn't one of the best
five afternoons of my life.

654
00:37:06,952 --> 00:37:09,706
I'm not really in the mood to shoot
the breeze with you, do you mind?

655
00:37:10,331 --> 00:37:12,129
Fine.

656
00:37:12,291 --> 00:37:13,930
I don't want to hold you up.

657
00:37:15,795 --> 00:37:17,229
But I do want to invite you to the biggest

658
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:20,930
and best debutant ball of the year.

659
00:37:21,175 --> 00:37:22,734
Mine.

660
00:37:22,885 --> 00:37:24,683
Now you don't have to come.

661
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:29,120
But I'll save you a slow
dance just in case.

662
00:37:45,157 --> 00:37:47,752
Does he have any redeeming qualities?

663
00:37:47,952 --> 00:37:53,072
All he does is talk about himself
and that stupid motor cycle.

664
00:37:53,374 --> 00:37:55,525
I bet he's a good kisser.

665
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:57,383
Oh, that is so gross.

666
00:37:57,545 --> 00:38:00,538
I mean, I cannot even imagine
kissing him.

667
00:38:01,424 --> 00:38:03,939
Whenever I'm in a room with a guy

668
00:38:04,135 --> 00:38:07,333
no matter who it is a date,
my dentist, anybody I think,

669
00:38:07,555 --> 00:38:09,512
who are the last two people on earth

670
00:38:09,682 --> 00:38:11,958
that I'd puke if he kissed me.

671
00:38:12,143 --> 00:38:13,463
Zach to Janey.

672
00:38:13,602 --> 00:38:15,514
Zach to Janey.

673
00:38:16,731 --> 00:38:17,528
Yeah, what's going on?

674
00:38:17,648 --> 00:38:18,479
Sister Natalie called.

675
00:38:18,607 --> 00:38:20,087
You're in deep trouble.

676
00:38:20,234 --> 00:38:23,068
Leave two dollars in small change
in front of my door.

677
00:38:23,571 --> 00:38:25,290
Sister Natalie?

678
00:38:25,823 --> 00:38:27,462
Natalie?

679
00:38:29,327 --> 00:38:32,161
Now he knows that
I skipped choir practice.

680
00:38:33,748 --> 00:38:35,626
All right, Lynne, what do we do now?

681
00:38:36,334 --> 00:38:37,848
Leave it to me.

682
00:38:38,002 --> 00:38:40,039
Come on, come on.

683
00:38:48,429 --> 00:38:49,419
- Janey!
- Okay, kiddo, you're home,

684
00:38:49,555 --> 00:38:50,989
you're sefe, you're alive.

685
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:52,540
My God, want happend?

686
00:38:52,683 --> 00:38:53,321
She overdid it.

687
00:38:53,434 --> 00:38:55,744
It was gymnastic's tryouts.

688
00:38:55,936 --> 00:38:57,848
She hyperventi lated
on the uneven parallel bars.

689
00:38:58,022 --> 00:38:59,820
She almost spun to death.

690
00:39:00,858 --> 00:39:03,293
I had to rip her fingers off.

691
00:39:04,987 --> 00:39:07,456
Okay. Bye.

692
00:39:07,865 --> 00:39:10,221
Call me later if you're not too busy.

693
00:39:48,197 --> 00:39:50,314
Oh, my god.

694
00:39:50,491 --> 00:39:51,163
Hi.

695
00:39:51,283 --> 00:39:52,876
Hi. How you doing?

696
00:39:53,035 --> 00:39:54,788
That could be you next week.

697
00:39:54,996 --> 00:39:56,396
Yeah, but at least
she has a really good dance partner,

698
00:39:56,539 --> 00:39:57,495
you know what I mean?

699
00:39:57,623 --> 00:39:59,740
- Shut up. Come on.
- Bye.

700
00:39:59,917 --> 00:40:01,067
He's so beautiful.

701
00:40:01,252 --> 00:40:01,890
He looked at you.

702
00:40:02,003 --> 00:40:02,402
When?

703
00:40:02,503 --> 00:40:03,300
Twice.

704
00:40:03,421 --> 00:40:04,377
You embarrassed me.

705
00:40:04,505 --> 00:40:07,976
He looked at me. He looked at me.

706
00:40:08,217 --> 00:40:10,527
Do you dress left or Right.

707
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:18,714
Well, my closet's on the left
side of my bed so I guess I dress left

708
00:40:18,978 --> 00:40:21,129
except if I have to wear something
out of the hamper,

709
00:40:21,313 --> 00:40:23,748
because that's on the right side of sink.

710
00:40:25,067 --> 00:40:26,387
Left.

711
00:40:29,822 --> 00:40:31,495
Am I interrupting anything.

712
00:40:31,657 --> 00:40:32,932
What are you doing here?

713
00:40:33,075 --> 00:40:35,112
Well, it's a free mall, isn't it?

714
00:40:39,498 --> 00:40:40,773
Excuse me, excuse me.

715
00:40:40,916 --> 00:40:44,387
Hey, there's Jeff's partner
and that cool girl.

716
00:40:44,628 --> 00:40:45,379
Where?

717
00:40:45,504 --> 00:40:47,735
Don't lower your arms.

718
00:40:47,923 --> 00:40:48,913
Janey!

719
00:40:49,050 --> 00:40:50,086
Lynne!

720
00:40:50,217 --> 00:40:52,015
Come here you guys, come here.

721
00:40:56,098 --> 00:40:59,933
Hey Janey girls, look.

722
00:41:00,186 --> 00:41:02,985
By day he's high school student,
by night he's a penguin.

723
00:41:03,189 --> 00:41:06,261
I happen to be personally
in vited by Miss Natalie Sands

724
00:41:06,484 --> 00:41:08,794
to a party at the country club tonight.

725
00:41:08,986 --> 00:41:10,579
You wish.

726
00:41:10,738 --> 00:41:12,172
She didn't invite him.

727
00:41:12,323 --> 00:41:13,837
She invited Jeff.

728
00:41:13,991 --> 00:41:15,903
He's just tagging along.

729
00:41:16,077 --> 00:41:18,433
Sorry. You always hurt the one you love.

730
00:41:18,621 --> 00:41:20,101
Natalie.

731
00:41:20,915 --> 00:41:22,508
Be right back.

732
00:41:28,422 --> 00:41:31,176
You move, you bleed.

733
00:41:34,553 --> 00:41:37,432
Hi. We need fifty of these right away.

734
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:38,994
Lynne.

735
00:41:39,141 --> 00:41:41,610
There's a few people
Natalie forgot to invite.

736
00:41:43,145 --> 00:41:45,705
Make it a hundred and fifty.

737
00:43:22,953 --> 00:43:27,903
Remember, nobody gets in without
on of these. Understand?

738
00:44:14,630 --> 00:44:16,667
Hey, I think your car's being towed.

739
00:44:31,731 --> 00:44:33,404
Some lady was leaning over
to get dome shrimp

740
00:44:33,566 --> 00:44:34,682
and I looked down her dress.

741
00:44:34,817 --> 00:44:36,774
This is a great party.

742
00:44:36,944 --> 00:44:38,424
Hey, there's J.P. Sands.

743
00:44:38,571 --> 00:44:39,971
I gotta thank him.

744
00:44:40,406 --> 00:44:41,362
I am absolutely...

745
00:44:41,490 --> 00:44:43,527
Mr. Sands, Drew Borman
of Borman Interproses.

746
00:44:43,701 --> 00:44:45,579
A pleasure to make your acquaiintance.

747
00:44:45,745 --> 00:44:46,417
Well, how do you do.

748
00:44:46,537 --> 00:44:48,608
Fine. This is a beautiful party.

749
00:44:48,789 --> 00:44:51,099
It must have cost a bundle.

750
00:44:51,292 --> 00:44:52,726
Well, I'll probably recover.

751
00:44:52,877 --> 00:44:53,594
I know you will.

752
00:44:53,711 --> 00:44:55,543
Natalie is worth every penny of it.

753
00:44:55,713 --> 00:44:57,147
Yes, yes, wonderful girl.

754
00:44:57,298 --> 00:44:59,255
She's terrific.

755
00:44:59,967 --> 00:45:01,879
Well, Mr. Borman,
it's certainly nice to see you.

756
00:45:02,053 --> 00:45:03,453
It was a pleasure to meet you, sir.

757
00:45:03,596 --> 00:45:04,916
Thank you.

758
00:45:06,223 --> 00:45:08,613
So how about them Cubs?

759
00:45:08,809 --> 00:45:10,687
I think it's their year.

760
00:45:49,975 --> 00:45:51,614
I love it.

761
00:45:51,769 --> 00:45:53,044
Thank you.

762
00:46:13,165 --> 00:46:13,996
Who was that creep?

763
00:46:14,125 --> 00:46:15,684
What the hell's going...

764
00:47:00,379 --> 00:47:01,733
Let's go!

765
00:47:14,226 --> 00:47:15,706
Can I have this, please?

766
00:47:15,853 --> 00:47:18,209
Please give it to me.

767
00:48:09,740 --> 00:48:12,733
I want you to find
out who those creepe are.

768
00:48:15,579 --> 00:48:18,890
I want to find out who's esponsible
for them being here.

769
00:48:20,167 --> 00:48:23,126
I want to know what happened
to our security.

770
00:48:23,337 --> 00:48:24,566
Look out!

771
00:48:31,971 --> 00:48:33,291
Get out of here!

772
00:48:38,644 --> 00:48:41,478
This means war.

773
00:49:02,084 --> 00:49:03,438
I gotta go.

774
00:49:18,267 --> 00:49:20,099
Oh, No! My god!

775
00:49:26,233 --> 00:49:26,871
One more of those,

776
00:49:26,984 --> 00:49:29,340
Miss Stone and you're staying
after school.

777
00:49:31,739 --> 00:49:33,810
He can't see me like this, all right?

778
00:49:33,991 --> 00:49:34,947
What, you mean as opposed

779
00:49:35,076 --> 00:49:37,193
to the glamorus Holy Grace uniforms?

780
00:49:38,245 --> 00:49:39,998
All right, look, go talk to him.

781
00:49:40,164 --> 00:49:41,883
I'll take care of Sister Sledge.

782
00:49:44,710 --> 00:49:46,224
Sister, would you mind showing

783
00:49:46,379 --> 00:49:48,132
me that routhine you do
on pommel horse?

784
00:49:48,297 --> 00:49:51,131
You do it so well
and I'm just so bad at it.

785
00:49:51,342 --> 00:49:52,696
I suppose I could.

786
00:49:52,843 --> 00:49:54,163
Thank you.

787
00:50:06,607 --> 00:50:07,757
Hi.

788
00:50:08,192 --> 00:50:09,342
Hi.

789
00:50:11,028 --> 00:50:13,145
That was quite a party Saturday?

790
00:50:14,281 --> 00:50:16,955
Yeah, well, you khow,
if you like that kind of think.

791
00:50:17,618 --> 00:50:19,974
So I tried to call you resterday.

792
00:50:20,579 --> 00:50:22,775
To see if you wanted to rehearse, I mean.

793
00:50:24,250 --> 00:50:27,129
Well my dad made us all
go to the air show.

794
00:50:27,795 --> 00:50:29,115
Well, was it fun?

795
00:50:29,255 --> 00:50:32,134
Two hundred people standing
around like this.

796
00:50:36,012 --> 00:50:37,685
It was a blast.

797
00:50:40,683 --> 00:50:42,481
So can you rehearse tonight?

798
00:50:42,643 --> 00:50:44,043
Can you?

799
00:50:46,314 --> 00:50:49,034
Sure. What, so I'll meet you there?

800
00:50:49,233 --> 00:50:49,950
No, not there.

801
00:50:50,067 --> 00:50:51,296
At the Court.

802
00:50:51,444 --> 00:50:53,800
But I thought that
we were going to rehearse?

803
00:50:53,988 --> 00:50:55,468
We'll rehearse.

804
00:50:55,906 --> 00:50:57,545
No fraternizing!

805
00:50:57,700 --> 00:51:00,260
Stay away from him, he's a boy!

806
00:51:07,001 --> 00:51:08,515
Bye.

807
00:51:08,669 --> 00:51:10,023
Bye.

808
00:51:18,262 --> 00:51:22,939
Do you mean you can't fix the contest
or you won't?

809
00:51:24,101 --> 00:51:26,411
Princess, you're gonna have
to start learning to fend for yourself.

810
00:51:26,604 --> 00:51:27,560
I keep telling you that.

811
00:51:27,688 --> 00:51:29,998
It's a cold world out there.

812
00:51:30,191 --> 00:51:33,025
Daddy, I don't want
to win the contest for me.

813
00:51:33,778 --> 00:51:35,974
I wanna win it for you.

814
00:51:38,699 --> 00:51:43,091
I couldn't stand it if those tacky kids,
Janey and Jeff won.

815
00:51:44,622 --> 00:51:47,456
After they trashed your party,

816
00:51:47,667 --> 00:51:50,819
and embarrassed you
in front of all your friends.

817
00:51:52,922 --> 00:51:55,517
And on top of everything else,

818
00:51:56,258 --> 00:52:00,616
they ruined your beautiful silver hair.

819
00:52:07,228 --> 00:52:09,106
Are you sure you're feeling all right?

820
00:52:09,271 --> 00:52:10,068
Yeah, I'm fine mom.

821
00:52:10,189 --> 00:52:12,067
I'm just I'm tired, that's all.

822
00:52:12,775 --> 00:52:14,334
Sleep tight.

823
00:52:14,485 --> 00:52:15,760
Goodnight, Mom.

824
00:53:21,927 --> 00:53:23,077
Hi, Jeff.

825
00:53:25,348 --> 00:53:26,464
Hi, Sally.

826
00:53:26,599 --> 00:53:27,635
I'm really sorry to interrupt you guys

827
00:53:27,767 --> 00:53:29,724
I lost the keys to my car again,

828
00:53:29,894 --> 00:53:32,363
and I was thinking that since
you helped me before that maybe

829
00:53:32,563 --> 00:53:33,963
you'd help my again.

830
00:53:35,691 --> 00:53:38,001
I'll just be two seconds. Okay?

831
00:53:38,194 --> 00:53:39,025
Two seconds.

832
00:53:39,153 --> 00:53:40,303
All right.

833
00:53:49,205 --> 00:53:51,401
Phil, your car's being towed.

834
00:53:51,916 --> 00:53:52,588
Hi, Tiffany.

835
00:53:52,708 --> 00:53:53,937
Hi, Drew.

836
00:53:54,085 --> 00:53:56,316
Tiffany, I was wondering, you see,

837
00:53:56,504 --> 00:53:58,143
there's this great game called
"Tune in Tokyo"

838
00:53:58,297 --> 00:53:59,253
and I know you'd be great at it.

839
00:53:59,382 --> 00:54:00,657
You wanna play?

840
00:54:02,426 --> 00:54:04,224
Sure I love games.

841
00:54:05,096 --> 00:54:06,132
I wanna dance with you.

842
00:54:06,263 --> 00:54:06,775
God, I'm really, I'm really tired.

843
00:54:06,889 --> 00:54:08,482
Okay.

844
00:54:09,433 --> 00:54:10,628
Well, I have a date.

845
00:54:10,768 --> 00:54:12,122
I do, I have a big date.

846
00:54:12,269 --> 00:54:12,827
Yeah, with me.

847
00:54:12,937 --> 00:54:14,417
All right, but you gotta go like this.

848
00:54:14,563 --> 00:54:16,236
- Beep Beep Beep.
- Beep Beep.

849
00:54:16,399 --> 00:54:17,719
All right, now picture this.

850
00:54:17,858 --> 00:54:19,815
It's World War Two
and our ship is going down

851
00:54:19,986 --> 00:54:21,181
in the middle of the Pacific.

852
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:23,676
And our only hope is the shortwave radio.

853
00:54:24,156 --> 00:54:25,875
Tune in Tokyo.

854
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:27,759
Tune in...

855
00:54:31,539 --> 00:54:33,895
Will you please let me go.

856
00:54:35,751 --> 00:54:36,867
Look, pal.

857
00:54:37,003 --> 00:54:38,437
She's with me, okay?

858
00:54:38,587 --> 00:54:39,782
No, man, you're wrong.

859
00:54:39,922 --> 00:54:41,197
She's with me.

860
00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:43,093
Now beat it.

861
00:54:43,259 --> 00:54:45,490
Okay. I don't want any trouble.

862
00:54:45,678 --> 00:54:46,794
I got an idea.

863
00:54:46,929 --> 00:54:48,761
Let's flip for her, okay?

864
00:54:51,267 --> 00:54:52,496
All right.

865
00:54:52,643 --> 00:54:55,317
This is great,
What, are you going to flip for me?

866
00:54:55,521 --> 00:54:57,274
Heads or tails"

867
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:58,715
Heads.

868
00:55:05,156 --> 00:55:07,546
Come on, let's go, come on!

869
00:55:10,995 --> 00:55:12,509
So what did you say, you'd flip for them?

870
00:55:12,663 --> 00:55:14,097
No, they flipped for me.

871
00:55:14,248 --> 00:55:15,204
Flippe for me.

872
00:55:15,333 --> 00:55:16,210
Bus running. Get on.

873
00:55:16,334 --> 00:55:17,324
I don't know, is the bike safe?

874
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:19,213
It's the safest thing you'll ever
have between your legs.

875
00:55:19,378 --> 00:55:19,697
What?

876
00:55:19,795 --> 00:55:21,275
Nothing.

877
00:55:21,422 --> 00:55:22,981
Hold on.

878
00:55:47,948 --> 00:55:49,268
Hold on.

879
00:55:52,912 --> 00:55:55,188
I got a cheek ache from smiling.

880
00:55:59,919 --> 00:56:01,717
I had such a good time.

881
00:56:02,421 --> 00:56:03,650
I'm glad.

882
00:56:05,966 --> 00:56:07,241
And...

883
00:56:08,427 --> 00:56:09,656
And what?

884
00:56:10,429 --> 00:56:13,263
Well, now you're supposed
to tell me how much fun you had.

885
00:56:16,268 --> 00:56:17,418
A lot.

886
00:56:27,905 --> 00:56:29,544
God, I'd better go home.

887
00:56:30,241 --> 00:56:31,516
Wait a minute, come on.

888
00:56:31,659 --> 00:56:34,538
No, I'm, I really.

889
00:56:36,455 --> 00:56:38,014
I can't believe that in two weeks

890
00:56:38,165 --> 00:56:41,158
I'm going to be dancing on DTV.

891
00:56:42,336 --> 00:56:44,293
I bet I get hit by a car.

892
00:56:44,463 --> 00:56:45,579
What?

893
00:56:45,715 --> 00:56:46,831
No, things are going too well.

894
00:56:46,966 --> 00:56:48,685
I mean, besides DTV I have a best friend.

895
00:56:48,843 --> 00:56:50,596
And I mean,
I never dreamed in a million years

896
00:56:50,761 --> 00:56:52,718
that I would have a boyfriend.

897
00:56:53,222 --> 00:56:55,100
Who's this boyfriend?

898
00:56:55,558 --> 00:56:57,231
No no, I mea,

899
00:56:57,393 --> 00:57:00,113
I didn't, I didn't mean I had...

900
00:57:00,313 --> 00:57:02,430
Oh, god.

901
00:57:02,606 --> 00:57:04,484
Look, if you talk to your boyfriend,

902
00:57:04,650 --> 00:57:06,369
you're just going to have
to tell him tough luck.

903
00:57:06,944 --> 00:57:09,334
Cause you're going to be
with me every night this week.

904
00:57:11,866 --> 00:57:13,983
So we're in this thing together, huh?

905
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:15,799
We sure are.

906
00:57:30,092 --> 00:57:31,287
Bye.

907
00:57:31,427 --> 00:57:32,907
I mean, bye.

908
00:57:33,679 --> 00:57:34,908
Bye.

909
00:58:09,256 --> 00:58:10,485
Sister.

910
01:00:12,004 --> 01:00:13,916
- Can't sleep.
- Oh, God!

911
01:00:15,091 --> 01:00:17,560
Daddy, really, don't, don't do that.

912
01:00:18,594 --> 01:00:20,586
Go on, sit down.

913
01:00:20,763 --> 01:00:23,232
By the way,
why aren't you in your p.j.'s?

914
01:00:23,432 --> 01:00:25,230
It's after midnight.

915
01:00:27,103 --> 01:00:30,062
Oh, I was dreaming that
I was going to be late for school,

916
01:00:30,272 --> 01:00:32,741
so I woke up and got dressed,

917
01:00:32,942 --> 01:00:35,332
and then I looked at the clock.

918
01:00:35,528 --> 01:00:36,564
Yeah, but you wear a uniform in school.

919
01:00:36,696 --> 01:00:38,574
That's not a uniform.

920
01:00:38,739 --> 01:00:41,095
In my dream I went to public school.

921
01:00:44,412 --> 01:00:46,529
Well, Janey, you know your mother
and I have been talking

922
01:00:46,706 --> 01:00:49,426
and we thought this weekend
we'd send you to St.

923
01:00:49,625 --> 01:00:50,502
Louis on a plane
to see your grandmother.

924
01:00:50,626 --> 01:00:51,855
No!

925
01:00:52,003 --> 01:00:54,040
Oh, I think it's just
what the doctor ordered.

926
01:00:54,213 --> 01:00:55,727
But not this weekend.

927
01:00:55,881 --> 01:00:56,359
Why not?

928
01:00:56,465 --> 01:01:00,141
There's a C-130 transport leaving
on Saturday at 08.00.

929
01:01:00,386 --> 01:01:01,866
Don't you want
to see your grandmother?

930
01:01:02,013 --> 01:01:03,288
Well, yeah.

931
01:01:03,431 --> 01:01:04,626
I mean, I sure do.

932
01:01:04,765 --> 01:01:08,042
Uh, but you see,
I, I have to study this weekend.

933
01:01:08,269 --> 01:01:10,181
You see there's there's this really big
Latin teat on Monday

934
01:01:10,354 --> 01:01:12,311
and I'm, I'm way, way behind.

935
01:01:12,481 --> 01:01:14,598
Since when do you take Latin?

936
01:01:14,775 --> 01:01:17,165
Since last week.
Which is why I'm way behind.

937
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:20,873
But thank anyway, Dad.

938
01:01:22,575 --> 01:01:25,135
I have to go back to bed again.

939
01:01:25,328 --> 01:01:26,557
Goodnight.

940
01:01:42,636 --> 01:01:44,070
What, are you craZy?

941
01:01:48,976 --> 01:01:51,127
I hope you aren't hurt.

942
01:01:54,065 --> 01:01:56,296
I'm J.P. Sands.

943
01:01:56,484 --> 01:01:57,554
Yeah, I know.

944
01:01:57,693 --> 01:01:59,366
Well, I did't know whether
you'd recohniZe me

945
01:01:59,528 --> 01:02:01,963
wihtout the blue berry pie in my hair.

946
01:02:02,782 --> 01:02:04,341
Are you in a big hurry?

947
01:02:04,909 --> 01:02:06,423
Yeah, kind of.

948
01:02:08,287 --> 01:02:12,076
When I was about your age
I worked in a bottling factory.

949
01:02:12,333 --> 01:02:14,484
I own the factory now.

950
01:02:14,877 --> 01:02:16,869
Matter of face own a lot of factories

951
01:02:17,046 --> 01:02:20,005
including the one where you father works.

952
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:23,315
I'm very happy for you.

953
01:02:23,511 --> 01:02:25,787
Don't smart mouth me.

954
01:02:25,971 --> 01:02:30,488
You know, I bet you and
I are a lot more like than you think.

955
01:02:30,768 --> 01:02:32,919
I'll bet you don't want your father
to lose his job anymore than

956
01:02:33,104 --> 01:02:37,462
I want my daughter
to lose that dance contest.

957
01:02:44,865 --> 01:02:46,140
By the way, if you'd like to come

958
01:02:46,283 --> 01:02:48,479
to my country club again, let me know.

959
01:02:49,370 --> 01:02:51,726
I can always use a good caddy.

960
01:03:12,310 --> 01:03:14,905
Hi.

961
01:03:16,939 --> 01:03:18,658
Hey, what's wrong?

962
01:03:18,816 --> 01:03:19,169
Nothing's wrong.

963
01:03:19,275 --> 01:03:20,868
What's wrong with you?

964
01:03:21,485 --> 01:03:22,441
Nothing.

965
01:03:22,570 --> 01:03:25,039
I just, you know I thought
since you were late.

966
01:03:25,239 --> 01:03:28,357
Excuse me, I didn't realize
we were punching a clock, okay?

967
01:03:28,951 --> 01:03:29,429
Well, we are.

968
01:03:29,535 --> 01:03:32,687
- Come on, today is our last day.
- Not now, please.

969
01:03:34,123 --> 01:03:35,159
All right, it's no problem.

970
01:03:35,291 --> 01:03:35,610
Uh, let's get to work.

971
01:03:35,708 --> 01:03:37,506
Do you have the tape?

972
01:03:38,627 --> 01:03:40,107
No, I forgot it.

973
01:03:41,297 --> 01:03:43,129
Come on, Jeff, that's not funny.

974
01:03:43,299 --> 01:03:44,494
Look, I'm telling ya, I forgot the tape.

975
01:03:44,633 --> 01:03:47,387
I think about things besides
this stupid contest, you know.

976
01:03:48,637 --> 01:03:50,629
All right, so who needs music anyway.

977
01:03:50,806 --> 01:03:52,240
Uh, let's go through the routine.

978
01:03:52,391 --> 01:03:53,871
Do you wanna warm up first?

979
01:03:54,852 --> 01:03:56,730
Look, would you quit treating me like
you're the star dancer

980
01:03:56,896 --> 01:03:59,252
and I'm some poor little clod
you got stuck with.

981
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:01,511
Now every one needs to warm up.

982
01:04:01,692 --> 01:04:03,206
Yes, they do.

983
01:04:03,361 --> 01:04:06,957
Oh, excuse me, I forgot you're also
the authority on warming up.

984
01:04:08,074 --> 01:04:09,349
Look, I don't know that's bugging you,

985
01:04:09,492 --> 01:04:11,085
but I think we should talk about it.

986
01:04:11,243 --> 01:04:13,041
I said, no.

987
01:04:13,204 --> 01:04:16,242
I'm not dancing
with you until you calm down.

988
01:04:16,457 --> 01:04:18,210
What, are you threatening me now?

989
01:04:18,376 --> 01:04:21,175
I mean, that's what you're doing,
right well forget it.

990
01:04:21,379 --> 01:04:23,416
I'm sick of this whole thing anyway.

991
01:04:23,589 --> 01:04:25,706
God, you were so naive, Janey.

992
01:04:25,966 --> 01:04:27,161
You think we're going to win this thing.

993
01:04:27,301 --> 01:04:28,496
We're not going to win.

994
01:04:28,636 --> 01:04:31,105
We're only going to be in this
stupid contest to make it look fair.

995
01:04:31,305 --> 01:04:32,102
But it's rigged.

996
01:04:32,223 --> 01:04:34,055
Everything's rigged.

997
01:04:34,225 --> 01:04:34,703
So what?

998
01:04:34,809 --> 01:04:36,243
You're just going to quit?

999
01:04:36,394 --> 01:04:38,192
I mean, just like that?

1000
01:04:38,729 --> 01:04:40,766
Yeah, it looks that way, doesn't it?

1001
01:04:43,567 --> 01:04:46,162
Get out of here, you make me sick.

1002
01:04:47,863 --> 01:04:48,580
Thanks.

1003
01:04:48,698 --> 01:04:51,008
I'll try and return
the compliment some day.

1004
01:05:13,889 --> 01:05:14,959
Lady, you're in big trouble.

1005
01:05:15,099 --> 01:05:15,498
Robert!

1006
01:05:15,599 --> 01:05:16,635
Robert!

1007
01:05:16,767 --> 01:05:17,723
Now Janey, we have to know

1008
01:05:17,852 --> 01:05:19,923
why you lied about your Latin class,

1009
01:05:20,104 --> 01:05:22,778
and then you, you skipped
you choir practice and now you,

1010
01:05:22,982 --> 01:05:25,656
you snuck out of the house
without our permission.

1011
01:05:26,444 --> 01:05:28,037
Why?

1012
01:05:28,988 --> 01:05:30,183
I don't know.

1013
01:05:30,323 --> 01:05:32,554
Oh, I feel much better now
that you've explanined.

1014
01:05:32,742 --> 01:05:34,495
You can't go traipsing all over
a strange city

1015
01:05:34,660 --> 01:05:36,174
in the middle of the night.

1016
01:05:36,329 --> 01:05:37,683
I'm sorry if you don't understand that.

1017
01:05:37,830 --> 01:05:38,866
Why does everybody think that

1018
01:05:38,998 --> 01:05:41,513
I'm not going to understand anything?

1019
01:05:41,709 --> 01:05:43,666
You are grounded.

1020
01:05:43,836 --> 01:05:46,476
Yeah, well I don't
have anyplace to go anyway.

1021
01:06:00,728 --> 01:06:03,038
I wonder how the Bears
are going to play this year.

1022
01:06:03,230 --> 01:06:05,984
Jesus. Their disabled list
is as long as my arm.

1023
01:06:07,193 --> 01:06:08,707
What's the matter?

1024
01:06:08,861 --> 01:06:10,136
Nothing.

1025
01:06:13,074 --> 01:06:15,589
Say, that dance contest is tonight, isn't

1026
01:06:15,785 --> 01:06:16,775
Oh, don't be nervous.

1027
01:06:16,911 --> 01:06:18,470
I'm not nervous.

1028
01:06:19,580 --> 01:06:21,139
I'm not entering.

1029
01:06:21,666 --> 01:06:23,020
Well, why not?

1030
01:06:23,167 --> 01:06:26,126
Well, Mag said that you
and your partner were

1031
01:06:26,337 --> 01:06:28,010
in a dimension beyond reality.

1032
01:06:28,172 --> 01:06:29,367
I guess that means you're good, huh?

1033
01:06:29,507 --> 01:06:31,658
Look, I'm not in the contest, all right?

1034
01:06:31,842 --> 01:06:33,834
They're for people
who are into being 'number one?

1035
01:06:34,011 --> 01:06:36,571
Oh, and you're not
into being number one?

1036
01:06:36,764 --> 01:06:38,323
No.

1037
01:06:42,353 --> 01:06:44,743
Jeff, I hear you're coming
up in the world.

1038
01:06:44,939 --> 01:06:46,339
Making the country club scene.

1039
01:06:46,482 --> 01:06:47,962
How'd you hear about that?

1040
01:06:48,818 --> 01:06:50,775
Bad news travels fast.

1041
01:06:50,945 --> 01:06:53,824
Especially when it happens to J.P. Sands.

1042
01:06:54,031 --> 01:06:55,385
I hate him.

1043
01:06:57,326 --> 01:06:58,680
Don't say that.

1044
01:06:58,828 --> 01:07:01,548
Now he's he's a greedy,
stupid putZ, granted,

1045
01:07:01,747 --> 01:07:04,467
but don't hate him.

1046
01:07:04,667 --> 01:07:06,863
I ran into him last night.

1047
01:07:09,046 --> 01:07:10,605
Oh?

1048
01:07:10,756 --> 01:07:11,633
What did he say?

1049
01:07:11,757 --> 01:07:14,067
He said he could
put your job on the line.

1050
01:07:15,302 --> 01:07:16,861
Is that true?

1051
01:07:19,807 --> 01:07:20,843
Well, so what?

1052
01:07:20,975 --> 01:07:23,285
So I can't dance in the contest can I?

1053
01:07:23,477 --> 01:07:24,991
Look Jeff, tell me one thing.

1054
01:07:25,146 --> 01:07:26,660
Can you win?

1055
01:07:26,814 --> 01:07:30,012
Yeah, yeah, I can win.

1056
01:07:30,234 --> 01:07:31,793
Well, then win it.

1057
01:07:32,737 --> 01:07:34,615
I'll worry about Sands.

1058
01:07:37,199 --> 01:07:38,553
Okay?

1059
01:07:39,702 --> 01:07:41,216
Thanks, Pop.

1060
01:08:00,264 --> 01:08:01,857
Timber!

1061
01:08:03,017 --> 01:08:04,770
Beat it, Zach.

1062
01:08:04,935 --> 01:08:06,130
Okay.

1063
01:08:06,270 --> 01:08:09,388
But we didn't even get to ask
you about Maggie.

1064
01:08:10,232 --> 01:08:11,063
Maggie Malene?

1065
01:08:11,192 --> 01:08:13,912
She told me to tell you, Jeff's gonna dance.

1066
01:08:20,326 --> 01:08:22,636
Oh, God, I forgot. I'm groundes!

1067
01:08:23,412 --> 01:08:25,369
Zach, what am I going to do?

1068
01:08:25,915 --> 01:08:27,872
You know what Daddy would say?

1069
01:08:28,042 --> 01:08:32,116
When all hope is lost
call for rein forcements.

1070
01:08:34,548 --> 01:08:36,665
Zach, you're the best.

1071
01:08:36,842 --> 01:08:39,038
Forget it. On the house.

1072
01:09:01,450 --> 01:09:03,760
Sweatbands, bandanas, buttons, caps

1073
01:09:03,953 --> 01:09:05,672
get your official DTV memor
abilia right...

1074
01:09:05,830 --> 01:09:07,981
Do you have a license
to sell these here?

1075
01:09:09,750 --> 01:09:12,106
A license, sure thing, officer. Sure.

1076
01:09:12,294 --> 01:09:13,614
Driver's license.

1077
01:09:14,964 --> 01:09:16,284
Student ID.

1078
01:09:18,592 --> 01:09:20,231
You know what's.

1079
01:09:21,470 --> 01:09:23,268
Oh, here it is.

1080
01:09:24,974 --> 01:09:25,771
It says here you're a member

1081
01:09:25,891 --> 01:09:28,565
of the Arechie and Jughead Fan Club.

1082
01:09:28,769 --> 01:09:31,159
Hey, I'm only in it for Veronica'a sake.

1083
01:09:33,316 --> 01:09:34,033
Hey, man, cut it out.

1084
01:09:34,150 --> 01:09:35,300
You can't do that.

1085
01:09:46,162 --> 01:09:46,879
Like my hair?

1086
01:09:46,996 --> 01:09:49,556
I thought you were
never going to get here. I love it.

1087
01:09:49,749 --> 01:09:50,500
Are you ready?

1088
01:09:50,624 --> 01:09:51,899
Am I ready.

1089
01:09:56,922 --> 01:09:58,322
Becareful, all right?

1090
01:10:09,685 --> 01:10:10,755
Watch out.

1091
01:10:21,530 --> 01:10:24,170
Oh, eat flame, boZo.

1092
01:10:25,701 --> 01:10:26,737
Let's go.

1093
01:10:26,869 --> 01:10:27,347
What are we doing?

1094
01:10:27,453 --> 01:10:27,852
Releases.

1095
01:10:27,953 --> 01:10:28,989
What are these?

1096
01:10:29,121 --> 01:10:30,077
Oh, these are the releases, right.

1097
01:10:30,206 --> 01:10:31,322
Coffee?

1098
01:10:31,457 --> 01:10:32,413
No thank you, no coffee.

1099
01:10:32,541 --> 01:10:33,736
Roger, take that.

1100
01:10:33,876 --> 01:10:36,550
Jeffrey, I want you and your partner

1101
01:10:36,754 --> 01:10:38,234
to sign these releases, please.

1102
01:10:38,381 --> 01:10:39,701
She's not here yet.

1103
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:41,240
What?

1104
01:10:41,384 --> 01:10:43,103
She's here but she's just,

1105
01:10:43,260 --> 01:10:44,660
She's meditating.

1106
01:10:44,804 --> 01:10:46,204
Meditating?

1107
01:10:46,347 --> 01:10:48,623
Yeah, she says it's like
going to another place.

1108
01:10:48,808 --> 01:10:49,320
Wonderful.

1109
01:10:49,433 --> 01:10:50,184
Well, when her pass,

1110
01:10:50,309 --> 01:10:52,107
port expires would you please
have her sign one of those.

1111
01:10:52,269 --> 01:10:52,861
Right.

1112
01:10:52,979 --> 01:10:54,299
Thank you.

1113
01:10:55,439 --> 01:10:56,077
Does this look all right?

1114
01:10:56,190 --> 01:10:56,668
Just a second.

1115
01:10:56,774 --> 01:10:58,527
- Hold your mouth still.
- Oh, sorry.

1116
01:11:03,656 --> 01:11:05,375
That's a very good color for you.

1117
01:11:07,576 --> 01:11:07,895
What's going on?

1118
01:11:07,994 --> 01:11:09,030
I mean, why are we stopping?

1119
01:11:09,161 --> 01:11:10,595
- I don't know...
- No, I gotta get there.

1120
01:11:10,746 --> 01:11:13,181
- We gotta get there, Lynne.
- I know. So hold still.

1121
01:11:19,005 --> 01:11:20,280
Really?

1122
01:11:20,423 --> 01:11:22,142
Let me tell you something.

1123
01:11:22,299 --> 01:11:24,575
You can be replaced.

1124
01:11:24,760 --> 01:11:26,797
I lifted the Music News,

1125
01:11:26,971 --> 01:11:32,330
to the level of ar tand you are
treating me like cattle.

1126
01:11:32,643 --> 01:11:33,838
Okay, moo!

1127
01:11:33,978 --> 01:11:36,209
Okay? Moo!

1128
01:11:36,397 --> 01:11:38,354
Now you get into wardrobe.

1129
01:11:39,734 --> 01:11:42,374
I quit!

1130
01:11:42,570 --> 01:11:44,323
Oh, great, great.

1131
01:11:44,488 --> 01:11:45,968
Great.

1132
01:11:48,451 --> 01:11:50,408
Not great, not great.

1133
01:11:50,578 --> 01:11:51,455
What's the prob?

1134
01:11:51,579 --> 01:11:53,252
My prob, she's not here yet.

1135
01:11:53,414 --> 01:11:54,450
- She's not here yet.
- Okay, calm down.

1136
01:11:54,582 --> 01:11:55,777
I got to get this release signed.

1137
01:11:55,916 --> 01:11:57,111
Ira juat handed me this thing.

1138
01:11:57,251 --> 01:11:57,889
Sign it.

1139
01:11:58,002 --> 01:11:59,356
What are you doing?

1140
01:11:59,503 --> 01:12:00,061
You can't do that.

1141
01:12:00,171 --> 01:12:00,729
Don't worry about it.

1142
01:12:00,838 --> 01:12:03,307
Don't! Is that legal?

1143
01:12:03,507 --> 01:12:04,224
Am I going to get sued for this?

1144
01:12:04,342 --> 01:12:06,220
- I don't know.
- Here!

1145
01:12:12,767 --> 01:12:14,759
What is this?

1146
01:12:14,935 --> 01:12:16,892

Oh, Glenn, leave it on a sec.

1173
01:13:35,516 --> 01:13:37,951
This kind of show reminds me

I'm not your buddy.

1225

A new Miss Dance TV.

You distracted me during my solo.

1253
