away with this, Brad.

165
00:14:04,338 --> 00:14:05,670
You're never gonna
find them, man.

166
00:14:08,507 --> 00:14:09,740
Tell me what
they look like.

167
00:14:09,742 --> 00:14:11,675
They don't look
like anything. Okay?

168
00:14:11,677 --> 00:14:13,610
What the fuck are you talking
about, "They don't look
like anything?"

169
00:14:13,911 --> 00:14:15,678
Brad. Fuck!

170
00:14:23,018 --> 00:14:24,051
All right.

171
00:14:53,046 --> 00:14:54,679
[detective] So, did they
have a weapon?

172
00:14:54,681 --> 00:14:55,980
[Brad] No, not that
I was aware of.

173
00:14:57,382 --> 00:14:59,015
But they forced their way
into the car?

174
00:15:00,784 --> 00:15:00,783
No.

175
00:15:04,921 --> 00:15:06,922
So you gave two
complete strangers

176
00:15:06,924 --> 00:15:08,523
a ride out in the middle
of nowhere,

177
00:15:08,525 --> 00:15:09,857
because you're
a nice guy--

178
00:15:09,859 --> 00:15:11,959
-No, I told--
-I'm just trying to
understand.

179
00:15:11,961 --> 00:15:13,927
I told you that
they were at the party,

180
00:15:13,929 --> 00:15:15,795
and that they asked
me for a ride home.

181
00:15:15,797 --> 00:15:17,463
And they tried to
steal your car.

182
00:15:17,465 --> 00:15:18,797
Yes.

183
00:15:19,732 --> 00:15:20,965
I've seen your car.

184
00:15:22,934 --> 00:15:25,101
What I can't understand
is why they
beat you up so bad.

185
00:15:27,003 --> 00:15:28,903
Did you say
something to them?

186
00:15:28,905 --> 00:15:31,338
Call them, something?
Resist, uh...

187
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:32,639
-Provoke.
-Fuck do I know?

188
00:15:39,379 --> 00:15:41,079
You know what
I think?

189
00:15:41,081 --> 00:15:42,747
I think you were
looking for drugs.

190
00:15:42,749 --> 00:15:44,615
I think you were trying
to buy drugs
from these guys,

191
00:15:44,617 --> 00:15:44,615
and things got
out of hand.

192
00:15:44,617 --> 00:15:47,084
It happens.
This I can help you with.

193
00:15:49,587 --> 00:15:50,820
I wasn't trying
to buy drugs.

194
00:15:54,825 --> 00:15:56,392
Okay.

195
00:15:56,394 --> 00:15:57,659
Not trying to buy drugs.

196
00:15:58,961 --> 00:15:59,927
[sniffs]

197
00:16:01,462 --> 00:16:02,895
I don't know what
else to tell you.

198
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:10,568
You go home and
get some rest.
We'll follow up.

199
00:17:11,062 --> 00:17:12,462
Fuck.

200
00:17:34,484 --> 00:17:35,984

[motor whirring]

203
00:18:12,585 --> 00:18:13,818
What are you
doing here?

204
00:18:14,719 --> 00:18:15,819
Want a beer?

205
00:18:16,086 --> 00:18:17,119
Yeah.

206
00:18:19,155 --> 00:18:20,855
-Nice to see you.
-Yeah. You, too.

207
00:18:20,857 --> 00:18:21,956
Get off Facebook.

208
00:18:28,195 --> 00:18:29,562
-Thanks, man.
-Gotcha.

209
00:18:36,503 --> 00:18:38,904
So what you
been up to?

210
00:18:38,906 --> 00:18:40,672
Yeah, dude. I'm sorry
I haven't been
back before now.

211
00:18:40,674 --> 00:18:42,606
I've just been
crazy busy. You know?

212
00:18:45,142 --> 00:18:46,242
How you doing?

213
00:18:46,843 --> 00:18:48,610
Good.

214
00:18:48,612 --> 00:18:48,610
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

215
00:18:51,013 --> 00:18:53,014
Mom said you're thinking
about bailing on school.

216
00:18:53,016 --> 00:18:54,782
I'm not bailing on it.

217
00:18:54,784 --> 00:18:56,550
I just don't know if I can
get all my shit together

218
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:57,784
before the fall,
you know.

219
00:18:57,786 --> 00:18:59,585
But you're already
accepted for the fall.

220
00:18:59,587 --> 00:19:01,086
Plus Phi Sig is
only rushing in the fall.

221
00:19:01,754 --> 00:19:02,987
I don't know, man.

222
00:19:07,759 --> 00:19:09,793
I'm not putting
any pressure on you.
I'm just saying.

223
00:19:11,662 --> 00:19:12,962
You should come
this weekend, though.

224
00:19:12,964 --> 00:19:14,296
We're throwing a huge party
at the lake.

225
00:19:14,298 --> 00:19:15,764
I think Leah is
gonna be there.

226
00:19:15,766 --> 00:19:16,798
Yeah, I know.

227
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,299
I'm sure you do know.

228
00:19:18,301 --> 00:19:19,867
[laughing]

229
00:19:19,869 --> 00:19:21,801
You're gonna...
You know, like
a little ass grab?

230
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:26,938
-[laughing]
-Oh, Jesus Christ.

231
00:19:30,609 --> 00:19:31,842
Okay.

232
00:19:31,844 --> 00:19:33,810
-Yeah?
-Yeah, I'll come for
the weekend.

233
00:19:33,812 --> 00:19:35,578
Fuck, yeah!

234
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:37,313
Just for the weekend,
though.

235
00:19:37,315 --> 00:19:39,748
Yeah.
It's all you need.
Just...

236
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,116
Get right in there,
grab that ass.

237
00:19:42,785 --> 00:19:43,985
[laughing]

238
00:19:43,987 --> 00:19:45,086
Oh, Jesus.

239
00:19:45,088 --> 00:19:46,153
It's good to
see you, man.

240
00:19:46,155 --> 00:19:47,254
You too, bro.

241

00:19:53,592 --> 00:19:54,858
Lando!

245
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,726
How you doing, man?

246
00:19:57,728 --> 00:19:59,060
-Hi. How you been?
-You look good.

247
00:19:59,062 --> 00:20:00,161
You all right?

248
00:20:00,163 --> 00:20:01,162
Hey, man.
How are you?

249
00:20:01,164 --> 00:20:02,229
-How you been?
-Good.

250
00:20:02,231 --> 00:20:03,296
-Good to see you.
-You too, man.

251
00:20:03,298 --> 00:20:04,597
-Brought the beer.
-Here you go.

252
00:20:05,198 --> 00:20:06,698
Welcome, Lands.

253
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,232
-Thanks, man.
-Say hello, everybody.

254
00:20:08,933 --> 00:20:10,733
Brett? Brett!

255
00:20:11,701 --> 00:20:13,768
Come over here,
you fucking asshole.

256
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:15,569
Couple of
my brothers here.

257
00:20:15,571 --> 00:20:16,670
Yeah, good to meet you.

258
00:20:18,272 --> 00:20:19,238
Whoo!

259
00:20:21,708 --> 00:20:22,974
[general chatter]

260
00:20:26,845 --> 00:20:28,846
So where you been
all summer?

261
00:20:28,848 --> 00:20:30,681
Just had some shit
I had to deal with
back home.

262
00:20:33,618 --> 00:20:35,685
Yo, Brad got fucking
rolled up on

263
00:20:35,687 --> 00:20:38,587
by some white trash
fucking rednecks, man.

264
00:20:38,589 --> 00:20:40,889
Those townie dudes
in Dawson are no joke, man.

265
00:20:40,891 --> 00:20:40,889
They know they got
nothing to lose.

266
00:20:40,891 --> 00:20:44,859
These motherfuckers are
literally on their way
to jail,

267
00:20:44,861 --> 00:20:48,028
and they figure shit they
can put you in the hospital
at the same time is better.

268
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:50,096
So what happened?

269
00:20:50,098 --> 00:20:53,065
They beat my ass,
stole my car.

270
00:20:53,067 --> 00:20:55,768
I'm just saying, man,
you creep up on a dude
like that behind his back,

271
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:57,302
you're straight pussy, man.

272
00:20:59,238 --> 00:21:01,105
I'll say this, though.

273
00:21:01,107 --> 00:21:03,240
My boy Brad knows
how to take
a fucking punch, man.

274
00:21:04,909 --> 00:21:05,942
Unlike some of us.

275
00:21:06,243 --> 00:21:07,910
Oh! What...

276
00:21:07,912 --> 00:21:09,344
Why are you
flinching, Baity?

277
00:21:09,346 --> 00:21:10,745
Fuck you.

[laughter]

279

You piece of shit.

00:21:13,983 --> 00:21:15,148
Baity, why are
you flinching?

281
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:16,349
[Baity]
I hate all of you.

-Hey.
-Hey.

285
00:21:31,297 --> 00:21:32,496
Do you mind if I sit?

286
00:21:32,498 --> 00:21:34,798
No, no. Please.
Got some towel.

287
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,265
-[laughs]
-Towel here.

288
00:21:39,969 --> 00:21:41,135
I'm really glad
you came.

289
00:21:42,203 --> 00:21:43,235
Me, too.

290
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:47,872
Yeah.

291
00:21:47,874 --> 00:21:48,973
How are you?

292
00:21:49,741 --> 00:21:49,740
I'm good.

293
00:21:54,011 --> 00:21:55,878
Yeah, they found a fracture
in my jaw, though.

294
00:21:56,946 --> 00:21:58,379
I mean, I remember
when it happened.

295
00:21:58,381 --> 00:22:01,014
'Cause I could hear it,
you know...

296
00:22:01,016 --> 00:22:03,016
I mean,
this guy's fist
just like...

297
00:22:05,319 --> 00:22:05,484
kept slamming
into my face.

298
00:22:10,456 --> 00:22:13,057
But I remember...
I remember I was
thinking of you.

299
00:22:15,126 --> 00:22:16,226
What do you mean?

300
00:22:17,828 --> 00:22:20,062
Just your last memory
of me was me

301
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:22,997
abandoning you
at a party.

302
00:22:23,531 --> 00:22:24,998
-And--
-No!

303
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,532
No, you did not
abandon me...

304
00:22:28,801 --> 00:22:30,167
...at all. No.

305
00:22:33,304 --> 00:22:34,537
Seriously.

306
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:50,451
[Brett] Yo, B.
You seen my keys?

307
00:22:51,052 --> 00:22:52,385
Oh, shit.

308
00:22:53,019 --> 00:22:54,386
Sorry.

309
00:22:54,388 --> 00:22:57,222
I'm gonna go get
another beer, actually.

310
00:22:57,224 --> 00:22:58,423
Okay. Yeah, yeah.

311
00:22:58,425 --> 00:22:59,457
Cool.

312
00:22:59,459 --> 00:23:00,958
Can of beer.
All right.

313
00:23:07,332 --> 00:23:09,566
I thought you said
she had
a fucking boyfriend, bro?

314
00:23:10,834 --> 00:23:11,967
[laughs]

315
00:23:12,201 --> 00:23:13,201
Shh.

316
00:23:14,403 --> 00:23:16,103
You're so drunk
right now, aren't you?

317
00:23:16,105 --> 00:23:17,537
Can you just get me
another fucking drink?

318
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:20,539
[laughs] You...

319
00:23:20,541 --> 00:23:22,874
Just keep
your voice down.

320
00:23:22,876 --> 00:23:24,475
Why don't you
drive this one.

321
00:23:24,477 --> 00:23:26,176
It's probably a good
idea, buddy.

322
00:23:26,178 --> 00:23:27,810
Probably take a nap
or something
like that?

323
00:23:27,812 --> 00:23:27,810
Yeah. [clears throat]

324
00:23:29,879 --> 00:23:32,146
Easy with

Brad, Dixon.

488
00:34:27,016 --> 00:34:28,582
This is my brother
I was telling you about.

489
00:34:29,183 --> 00:34:30,783
-What's up, Brad?
-Hey, man.

490
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:33,184
One of those?

491
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:39,155
Brad, how do you like
all the shit so far, huh?

492
00:34:39,157 --> 00:34:41,757
I don't know.
It's good times, right?

493
00:34:44,627 --> 00:34:46,728
Right.

494
00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:49,464
So you're a business major,
like your fag brother here,
or what?

495
00:34:49,466 --> 00:34:50,798
No.

496
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,199
No, I don't really
have a major yet.

497
00:34:52,201 --> 00:34:53,767
I'll probably just
wait and see.

498
00:34:55,536 --> 00:34:56,936
Cool. Nice.

499
00:34:56,938 --> 00:34:58,137
Good luck with that.

500
00:35:03,076 --> 00:35:04,976
All right, Well, I left
Chance on the grill.

501
00:35:04,978 --> 00:35:07,144
I got to make sure
he's not fucking

00:35:16,851 --> 00:35:18,051
What?

505
00:35:19,753 --> 00:35:22,121
All that "good times"
bullshit?

506
00:35:22,123 --> 00:35:23,589
Bro, they're not gonna
let you in here

507
00:35:23,591 --> 00:35:25,157
just 'cause you're my brother.
I can't...

508
00:35:25,159 --> 00:35:26,725
Yeah, I fucking

509
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:29,694
'Cause they're weird
about that shit.

510
00:35:29,696 --> 00:35:31,929
You need to fucking
shake their hand,

511
00:35:31,931 --> 00:35:33,630
look 'em in the eye,
let 'em know
you wanna be here.

512
00:35:33,632 --> 00:35:34,998
All right. What do you
fucking want me to do?

513
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,499
I want you to
just have fun.

514
00:35:36,501 --> 00:35:37,800
-Okay.
-And just chill out.

515
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:38,967

00:49:15,354 --> 00:49:17,888
Get the fuck

816
00:49:33,367 --> 00:49:34,967
[echoing]

817
00:49:39,472 --> 00:49:41,339
Brad, get the fuck up!

818
00:49:43,842 --> 00:49:44,975
[hollering continues]

00:50:31,755 --> 00:50:33,055
[spits]

820
00:50:43,132 --> 00:50:45,133
Let me ask you a question.
What the fuck happened
in there?

821
00:50:46,435 --> 00:50:47,568
I don't fucking know, dude.

822
00:50:50,104 --> 00:50:52,672
Okay. Well, Dixon's looking
for a reason to kick your
ass out today.

823
00:50:52,674 --> 00:50:54,640
Okay? It's just
I cheated for you.

824
00:50:54,642 --> 00:50:56,708
-What?
-This shit cannot happen.

825
00:50:56,710 --> 00:50:58,776
Dude, I didn't fucking
ask for your help in there.

826
00:50:59,744 --> 00:51:01,611
I didn't ask
for your help.

827
00:51:01,613 --> 00:51:03,079
Look, I wouldn't do
this myself, all right?

828
00:51:03,081 --> 00:51:05,014
They just fucking do this
to weed out the weak ones.

829
00:51:06,983 --> 00:51:08,817
Show 'em you mean business.
Show 'em you wanna be here.

830
00:51:08,819 --> 00:51:10,051
Okay.

831
00:51:10,053 --> 00:51:11,619
All right?
You got to be tougher.

832
00:51:13,054 --> 00:51:14,821
-You can do this, dude.
-I know.

833
00:51:16,423 --> 00:51:17,523
I fucking will be.

834
00:51:17,525 --> 00:51:18,757
-Come on. Let's go.
-Good.

835
00:51:18,759 --> 00:51:19,791
All right.

836
00:51:38,710 --> 00:51:40,177
Hey, man.

837
00:51:40,179 --> 00:51:41,279
You all right?

838
00:51:46,718 --> 00:51:48,618
I was gonna
go get some pizza,
if you wanna come.

839
00:51:59,863 --> 00:52:02,331
Oh, man. Brad.
I didn't know this
happened to you.

840
00:52:02,333 --> 00:52:03,865
Shit, dude.

841
00:52:16,812 --> 00:52:18,212
Sick of feeling scared

842
00:52:18,214 --> 00:52:20,113
like all the time,
you know.

843
00:52:29,889 --> 00:52:31,923
Hey, I'm sorry that
happened to you, man.
It's crazy.

844
00:52:42,767 --> 00:52:43,867
[Brett] Brad?

845
00:52:45,803 --> 00:52:47,136
Brad?

846
00:52:48,004 --> 00:52:49,371
Bradley?

847
00:52:50,306 --> 00:52:51,739
Wake up!

848
00:52:51,741 --> 00:52:51,739
Get this goat.

849
00:52:51,741 --> 00:52:54,742
You know what
goats eat, right?
Goats eat shit.

850
00:53:00,781 --> 00:53:02,281
What? Go back
in your room.

851
00:53:16,329 --> 00:53:18,129
[guy] Time to eat shit,
goat motherfucker.

852
00:53:18,131 --> 00:53:19,997
[Brad] No, no, no, no!

853
00:53:19,999 --> 00:53:21,398
What the fuck, dude!

854
00:53:21,866 --> 00:53:22,966
Get down.

855
00:53:25,669 --> 00:53:26,702
Grab it.

856
00:53:26,704 --> 00:53:27,936
-Grab the--
-Stop that, dude!

857
00:53:27,938 --> 00:53:29,070
Grab the shit.

858
00:53:29,072 --> 00:53:30,104
Grab it.

859

You're not leaving

861
00:53:36,642 --> 00:53:38,376
Get that shit...

Whoo!

866
00:53:47,217 --> 00:53:49,217
Yo, where's your roommate?
Where's Fitch the bitch, man?

867
00:53:49,219 --> 00:53:50,351
I want my goat.

868
00:53:50,353 --> 00:53:52,886
He's got
fucking class, man.

869
00:53:52,888 --> 00:53:54,754
[guy] All right.
I got to get to class, too.

870
00:53:54,756 --> 00:53:56,122
Just getting started.

Yeah.

What's up, dude?

878
00:54:28,949 --> 00:54:30,415
Yo, we're going
to the farm.
You, uh...

879
00:54:31,784 --> 00:54:33,151
What are you doing?

880
00:54:33,153 --> 00:54:35,920
What's "the farm"?
What are you
talking about?

881
00:54:35,922 --> 00:54:36,987
Getting the
fucking goat, dude.

882
00:54:39,323 --> 00:54:40,356
Yo, I thought
that was a joke.

883
00:54:42,292 --> 00:54:44,793
No, no. Baity found one

It's fucking happening.

884
00:54:46,428 --> 00:54:48,061
Got it. Got it.

885
00:54:51,698 --> 00:54:53,265
Is this pledge getting
weirder this year?

886
00:54:54,967 --> 00:54:56,067
"Weirder?"

887
00:54:58,003 --> 00:54:59,469
I don't know. Harder?

888
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:04,106
What...

889
00:55:04,108 --> 00:55:05,740
Is that a fucking joke?

890
00:55:07,843 --> 00:55:10,110
No, man. It's just...

891
00:55:10,112 --> 00:55:13,880
J-Town put a cigarette out
on my ass last year
in front of the Tri Delts.

892
00:55:15,482 --> 00:55:17,983
The pledgers got

All right, bitches.
We'll play
a little game, okay?

911
00:56:46,558 --> 00:56:47,858

the first president of
the United States?

913

Slap Brad in the fucking face.
Are you deaf?

931
00:57:39,161 --> 00:57:40,895
Slap him in the face.

01:09:41,378 --> 01:09:43,611
Fuck him.

1134
01:09:43,613 --> 01:09:45,613
It's not his decision, man,
all the brothers vote equally.

1135
01:09:47,182 --> 01:09:48,849
I just feel like a pussy.

1136
01:09:48,851 --> 01:09:50,083
The dude scares
the shit out of me.

1137
01:09:51,018 --> 01:09:52,385
Maybe you should
just quit.

1138
01:09:52,387 --> 01:09:53,753
I can't quit.

1139
01:09:54,054 --> 01:09:55,354
Why not?

1140
01:09:55,356 --> 01:09:57,189
The same reason
you can't quit.

1141
01:09:57,191 --> 01:09:58,657
I have no fucking idea
why I don't quit.

1142
01:09:59,025 --> 01:10:00,325
Yeah, you do.

1143
01:10:00,327 --> 01:10:00,325
Everybody does.

1144
01:10:00,327 --> 01:10:03,328
Dude, if you quit,
what else is there?

1145
01:10:03,330 --> 01:10:06,130
You know? You just
another guy that
couldn't hack it.

1146
01:10:06,132 --> 01:10:08,365
And everywhere you go,
everyone's gonna know that.

1147
01:10:08,367 --> 01:10:10,367
That's not true.

1148
01:10:10,369 --> 01:10:14,270
Bullshit. Yeah, you can't even
go to a party on campus
without seeing them.

1149
01:10:14,272 --> 01:10:16,805
It's just the way it is.

1150
01:10:16,807 --> 01:10:19,007
I'm having sex for
the first time in my life.

1151
01:10:19,009 --> 01:10:21,309
You know I'm not stupid.
Brad, that's not because
of me.

1152
01:10:21,311 --> 01:10:23,911
You know,
if the fraternity goes,
everything goes with it.

1153
01:10:26,948 --> 01:10:28,248
Don't give up, man.

1154
01:10:29,883 --> 01:10:31,083
Hey, we just got
pinned, right?

1155
01:10:33,086 --> 01:10:34,820
We're fine.

1156
01:10:34,822 --> 01:10:36,187
We're fine.

1157
01:10:39,191 --> 01:10:40,424
Where you going?

1158
01:10:42,226 --> 01:10:43,426
To clear my head.

1159
01:10:45,228 --> 01:10:46,861
I'll see you
back at the room.

1160
01:11:07,982 --> 01:11:09,048
Hey.

1161
01:11:09,050 --> 01:11:10,282
What's your fucking
problem, man?

1162
01:11:12,885 --> 01:11:13,918
What?

1163
01:11:14,185 --> 01:11:15,952
"What?"

1164
01:11:15,954 --> 01:11:18,087
Why are you acting like
such a fucking asshole
to me?

1165
01:11:18,755 --> 01:11:20,455
Whatever, man.

1166
01:11:20,457 --> 01:11:22,690
No, I'm fucking
serious, man.

1167
01:11:22,692 --> 01:11:25,359
Why, because I didn't feel
like coming to some
bullshit ceremony?

1168
01:11:25,361 --> 01:11:27,361
Why the fuck was Wes
the one pinning me tonight,
and not you?

1169
01:11:27,363 --> 01:11:27,361
You're lucky it was Wes.

1170
01:11:27,363 --> 01:11:30,263
They wanted to give you Dixon
and I stopped them.

1171
01:11:30,265 --> 01:11:32,298
What, you think I can't
fucking handle Dixon?

1172
01:11:33,433 --> 01:11:34,833
Fuck you, man.

1173
01:11:36,402 --> 01:11:38,436
You are un-fucking-believable.

1174
01:11:38,438 --> 01:11:40,037
Can you get out of
my room now, please?

1175
01:11:40,039 --> 01:11:42,372
No. Not until you tell me
what's going on with you.

1176
01:11:42,374 --> 01:11:43,339
Nothing's going on.

1177
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:45,707
Nothing.

1178
01:11:45,709 --> 01:11:47,475
This shit
doesn't fucking matter.
That's what you don't get.

1179
01:11:47,477 --> 01:11:49,777
Okay?
None of this shit matters
at all.

1180
01:11:49,779 --> 01:11:52,045
This shit fucking
matters to me.

1181
01:11:52,047 --> 01:11:53,746
-Don't fucking push me.
-What are you gonna do?

1182
01:11:54,380 --> 01:11:55,446
You gonna fucking
kick my ass?

1183
01:11:55,448 --> 01:11:56,980
-I'm not gonna fight you.
-Why not?

1184
01:11:56,982 --> 01:11:58,381
Why not?
Just say it, goddammit!

1185
01:11:58,383 --> 01:11:59,915
Because you don't
belong here.

1186
01:12:00,950 --> 01:12:02,884
You don't fucking
belong here.

1187
01:12:05,020 --> 01:12:05,953
This is not for you.

1188
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:13,060
Okay.

1189
01:12:13,062 --> 01:12:14,428
-Hey...
-No, that's what I thought.

You're a dead man.
Get up against the wall.

No.

1197
01:13:13,147 --> 01:13:14,412
I'm sorry. I think...

1198
01:13:14,414 --> 01:13:15,913
There's something
in my fucking ear.

1199
01:13:15,915 --> 01:13:16,914
What did you say to me?

1200
01:13:16,916 --> 01:13:18,315
Fuck you,
I'm not doing that.

1201
01:13:18,317 --> 01:13:19,883
I'm not asking.
You do it,

1202
01:13:19,885 --> 01:13:19,883
or you're fucking
out of here.

1203

Hundred point. Mark it,
Baity, you fat fuck.

[Baity laughing]

1289
01:17:40,352 --> 01:17:42,553
Oh, that's
fucking incredible.

1290
01:17:42,555 --> 01:17:45,255
Now get that egg roll, buddy.
You got an hour.

1291
01:17:45,257 --> 01:17:46,856
Go, hustle. Hustle.

1292
01:17:46,858 --> 01:17:48,190
[both laughing]

1293
01:17:50,593 --> 01:17:52,393
[breathing heavily]

1294
01:18:00,634 --> 01:18:01,800
[sighs heavily]

1295
01:18:02,835 --> 01:18:04,302
Oh, fuck.

1296
01:18:07,439 --> 01:18:09,673
[breathing heavily]

1297
01:18:13,711 --> 01:18:15,445
[serene music playing]

1298
01:19:28,651 --> 01:19:29,951
[ambulance sirens wailing]

[knocking on door]

1300
01:20:08,522 --> 01:20:09,555
What are you doing?

1301
01:20:11,524 --> 01:20:12,624
Just cleaning up his shit.

1302
01:20:18,797 --> 01:20:20,364
I know.
It's crazy, man.

1303
01:20:21,499 --> 01:20:22,765
You hardly even knew him,
you know.

1304
01:20:23,666 --> 01:20:24,766
I knew him.

1305
01:20:27,336 --> 01:20:28,402
He was my roommate.

1306
01:20:33,741 --> 01:20:35,608
I just feel like he didn't
deserve this, you know.

1307
01:20:39,446 --> 01:20:42,314
No, he just had
a bad heart, dude.

1308
01:20:54,760 --> 01:20:57,294
You wanna stay over
at the house tonight?

1309
01:20:57,296 --> 01:20:59,262
I feel like that will be
better than being here.

1310
01:21:06,436 --> 01:21:07,669
Okay.

1311
01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:13,373
[organ music playing]

1312
01:21:35,328 --> 01:21:37,829
[organ music continues]

1313
01:21:42,801 --> 01:21:44,001
[whispering indistinctly]

1314
01:22:00,984 --> 01:22:02,317
Hey, Brad.

1315
01:22:02,618 --> 01:22:03,851
Hey, man.

1316
01:22:07,055 --> 01:22:08,922
-Hey, man.
How you doing?
-Good.

1317
01:22:08,924 --> 01:22:10,490
-You doing all right?
-Yeah.

1318
01:22:10,858 --> 01:22:12,458
Oh, man.

1319
01:22:12,460 --> 01:22:15,527
This must be so hard for you.
I can't even imagine.

1320
01:22:15,529 --> 01:22:16,961
I can't fucking
imagine, man.

1321
01:22:16,963 --> 01:22:18,729
It's been terrible.
Buddy, I mean...

1322
01:22:20,631 --> 01:22:22,798
Dude, you know, um...

1323
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:24,900
If you ever want
to talk to anybody,
or anything like that.

1324
01:22:24,902 --> 01:22:26,768
If you ever want to talk...
Get anything off your chest,

1325
01:22:26,770 --> 01:22:28,102
-you know I'm
here for you, right?
-Yeah.

1326
01:22:28,104 --> 01:22:29,837
-Anything. I'm here for you.
-Thanks, dude.

1327
01:22:29,839 --> 01:22:31,338
Thanks, Chance.

1328
01:22:31,340 --> 01:22:33,440
Yeah, of course, man.

1329
01:22:33,442 --> 01:22:36,776
We're actually doing
a little get together tonight
at the house.

1330
01:22:36,778 --> 01:22:38,778
Just brothers only.
Just to chat.

1331
01:22:38,780 --> 01:22:40,713
No drinking or anything.
Just to talk.

1332
01:22:40,715 --> 01:22:42,381
Just trying to deal about
what we're feeling.

1333
01:22:42,383 --> 01:22:44,616
Yeah, I don't think I can
come tonight, Chance.

1334
01:22:44,618 --> 01:22:46,618
I just think it's important
that we're all there, man.

1335
01:22:46,620 --> 01:22:48,419
That's all.
Or else I wouldn't ask.

1336
01:22:48,421 --> 01:22:50,754
I just think it's important
that we're all with brothers.

1337
01:22:50,756 --> 01:22:52,489
You know what I mean?

1338
01:22:52,491 --> 01:22:53,790
Yeah, all right.

1339
01:22:53,792 --> 01:22:55,024
Okay, man.

1340
01:22:55,026 --> 01:22:56,925
Okay.

1341
01:22:56,927 --> 01:22:59,093
Hey, I love you.
All right? Hang in there.

1342
01:22:59,095 --> 01:23:00,694
-Yeah.
-See you tonight, okay?

1343
01:23:00,696 --> 01:23:01,861
-Okay. You too. Okay.
-I love you.

1344
01:23:01,863 --> 01:23:02,828
Yeah.

1345
01:23:08,834 --> 01:23:10,000
[door opens]

1346
01:23:10,901 --> 01:23:12,101
[door shuts]

1347
01:23:16,539 --> 01:23:18,406
Yo, what's up?
Did he call you?

1348
01:23:18,408 --> 01:23:20,907
He said the fucking school's
putting us on probation.

1349
01:23:23,543 --> 01:23:25,510
What does that mean, man?
What does probation mean?

1350
01:23:25,512 --> 01:23:26,944
It doesn't fucking
mean anything yet.

1351
01:23:26,946 --> 01:23:29,913
Okay? It just means they're
launching an investigation.

1352
01:23:31,682 --> 01:23:34,450
We'll all probably have to
go in and, you know,

1353
01:23:34,452 --> 01:23:36,051
fucking talk to the probos.

1354
01:23:36,053 --> 01:23:37,886
[Baity]
What the fuck?

1355
01:23:37,888 --> 01:23:39,053
He wasn't even here.

1356
01:23:39,055 --> 01:23:39,053
He died on campus.

1357
01:23:39,055 --> 01:23:43,157
Yeah, well, someone must
have told them about
the concussion, right.

1358
01:23:43,159 --> 01:23:45,058
No, it wasn't
the concussion, man.

1359
01:23:45,060 --> 01:23:46,626
We gotta stop saying that.

1360
01:23:46,628 --> 01:23:47,960
We need to stop saying that.

1361
01:23:48,928 --> 01:23:48,927
He went to the infirmary.

1362
01:23:51,397 --> 01:23:52,730
They know that it
happened in the house.

1363
01:23:52,732 --> 01:23:54,898
I don't fucking know.

1364
01:23:54,900 --> 01:23:56,699
Dude, this is serious.
They could kick us
out of school.

1365
01:23:56,701 --> 01:23:58,100
This is serious.

1366
01:23:58,102 --> 01:23:59,801
Okay. I don't know who's
fucking telling them this.

1367
01:23:59,803 --> 01:24:00,968
-Okay?
-[Chance sighs]

1368
01:24:02,704 --> 01:24:04,504
-Fuck! Sorry.
-Look...

1369
01:24:05,572 --> 01:24:06,872
I'm sorry.

1370
01:24:06,874 --> 01:24:08,406
We need to huddle up
on this shit.

1371
01:24:08,408 --> 01:24:10,174
Yeah.

1372
01:24:10,176 --> 01:24:12,843
All right? We can't be
telling them anything that
they don't even know.

1373
01:24:12,845 --> 01:24:14,744
I'm not gonna fucking
lie to them.

1374
01:24:14,746 --> 01:24:16,812
If I lose my scholarship,
my dad's gonna
fucking kill me.

1375
01:24:16,814 --> 01:24:18,580
No one's fucking
telling you to lie, Baity.

1376
01:24:19,982 --> 01:24:21,816
Look, we haven't been
doing anything

1377
01:24:21,818 --> 01:24:23,584
that every other
fraternity on campus

1378
01:24:23,586 --> 01:24:25,085
hasn't been doing
for the last...

1379
01:24:26,554 --> 01:24:28,087
What?

1380
01:24:28,089 --> 01:24:29,655
Fucking 100 years.

1381
01:24:29,657 --> 01:24:30,922
-Yeah, I know, dude.
-A hundred years.

1382
01:24:30,924 --> 01:24:32,456
-Right?
-I know.

1383
01:24:33,524 --> 01:24:35,758
-Right?
-Yeah. Right.

1384
01:24:37,994 --> 01:24:39,794
If you don't have an answer,

1385
01:24:41,530 --> 01:24:43,030
just say, "I don't know."

1386
01:24:46,034 --> 01:24:47,100
[door opens]

1387
01:24:56,043 --> 01:24:58,077
Just keep your fucking
mouth shut, Baity.

1388
01:25:04,550 --> 01:25:05,983
Go and talk to the pledgers.

1389
01:25:07,752 --> 01:25:09,119
Hey...

1390
01:25:09,121 --> 01:25:10,987
Brad didn't show up
to the meet up.

1391
01:25:16,226 --> 01:25:17,893
[birds chirping]

[door opening]

1394
01:25:55,595 --> 01:25:56,695
Come on in, Brad.

1395
01:26:06,839 --> 01:26:07,972
[door shuts]

1396
01:26:22,353 --> 01:26:24,153
How you holding up, Brad?

1397
01:26:24,155 --> 01:26:26,321
I'm fine.
[clears throat]

1398
01:26:26,323 --> 01:26:28,289
You and Will were pledging
together, right?

1399
01:26:28,291 --> 01:26:29,790
Mmm-hmm. Yeah.
That's right.

1400
01:26:31,359 --> 01:26:32,625
What was that like?

1401
01:26:33,827 --> 01:26:36,261
I don't know.
Just normal stuff.

1402
01:26:41,199 --> 01:26:42,399
Were they hazing Will?

1403
01:26:51,975 --> 01:26:53,742
Come on, man.

1404
01:26:53,744 --> 01:26:55,110
They were beating the crap
out of him, right?

1405
01:26:56,112 --> 01:26:57,846
What do you think?
I mean...

1406
01:26:59,114 --> 01:27:01,215
Just normal
pledge term stuff.
I mean...

1407
01:27:02,083 --> 01:27:03,650
You've been here a while.

1408
01:27:04,918 --> 01:27:06,885
I mean, I don't
understand what...

1409
01:27:08,387 --> 01:27:10,855
Right? He was
running on the track.
It was a heart attack.

1410
01:27:10,857 --> 01:27:12,256
He had bruises
all over his body.

1411
01:27:14,192 --> 01:27:17,059
He went to the infirmary
for a head injury
the week before he died.

1412
01:27:19,362 --> 01:27:21,262
That was the school's
responsibility

1413
01:27:21,264 --> 01:27:23,197
to keep this kind of thing
from happening.

1414
01:27:23,199 --> 01:27:26,333
It's my duty to make sure
that this kind of behavior
stops.

1415
01:27:26,335 --> 01:27:27,934
And you know what?
It's your responsibility--

1416
01:27:27,936 --> 01:27:29,869
It's my "responsibility,"
it's your "duty."

1417
01:27:29,871 --> 01:27:32,705
Will's dead. He's dead.

1418
01:27:32,707 --> 01:27:34,840
Okay? I don't know
what else to tell you.

1419
01:27:37,243 --> 01:27:38,810
Brad, just tell me
what happened.

1420
01:27:44,015 --> 01:27:45,715
[exhales]

1421
01:27:55,125 --> 01:27:57,059
Dude. Where have
you been, man?

1422
01:27:57,061 --> 01:27:58,760
I've been looking
everywhere for you.

1423
01:27:58,762 --> 01:27:59,794
Okay?

1424
01:27:59,796 --> 01:28:01,028
What are we gonna do?

1425
01:28:01,030 --> 01:28:01,028
I don't know.
What are you
talking about?

1426
01:28:01,030 --> 01:28:04,398
The fraternity just
got suspended for
the rest of the year.

1427
01:28:05,199 --> 01:28:06,766
What?

1428
01:28:06,768 --> 01:28:08,067
Yeah. Somebody
fucking talked, dude.
It's over.

1429
01:28:09,969 --> 01:28:11,336
It wasn't you, was it?

1430
01:28:12,104 --> 01:28:13,737
No.

1431
01:28:13,739 --> 01:28:15,705
I mean, what the fuck
was all that for?

1432
01:28:15,707 --> 01:28:17,239
Dude, we never
even got in.

1433
01:28:17,241 --> 01:28:19,407
Dude, I had offers, like,
anywhere. All right?

1434
01:28:19,409 --> 01:28:21,308
I could have pledged
anywhere at this school.

1435
01:28:21,310 --> 01:28:23,410
I don't even care if it sounds
like bragging at this point,
you know.

1436
01:28:23,412 --> 01:28:26,079
This is fucked up, dude.
All of that for noth--

1437
01:28:26,780 --> 01:28:28,847
Oh, fuck!

1438
01:28:36,722 --> 01:28:38,055
Oh, my God!

Fuck that, dude.

No, no. You're not talking
to your brother right now.

You're not talking
to your brother right now.

You're talking to Baity and

Okay. get out of my way.
I need to speak to my brother.

Can I ask you
a serious question?

Can I ask you
a serious question?

Shit. You're gonna
lie to me?

Can I see Brad
just for a second?

-How are you?
-Hi.

1511
01:32:34,647 --> 01:32:38,348
Hey, listen. Before we go in,
I wanted to show you something.

1512
01:32:42,486 --> 01:32:43,018
That's one of the guys,
isn't it?

1513
01:32:47,456 --> 01:32:49,590
So last week,
he makes bail.

1514
01:32:49,592 --> 01:32:52,125
That night he goes out and
tries to rob a gas station.

Shot three times
in the chest.

The guy's already
in there.

1517

Before we go in though,

1518
01:33:06,205 --> 01:33:08,038
I want you to
think back on that night.

1519
01:33:09,373 --> 01:33:11,006
Any detail you
can remember.

1520
01:33:11,008 --> 01:33:13,341
Anything about their face,
anything about their body.

Any distinguishing marks
that might help you
identify them.

All right?

1523

All right. Let's do this.

01:33:25,685 --> 01:33:27,485
Remember.
They can't see you.

1525
01:33:27,487 --> 01:33:29,019
So just take your time.

1526

When you're ready...

1527

Tell me if you recognize
any one of them.

No.

01:34:06,821 --> 01:34:08,288
Are you sure?

1530
01:34:11,258 --> 01:34:12,758
Yeah, I don't see him here.

1531

Well...

1532
01:34:18,664 --> 01:34:21,599
We can actually place
one of them

1533
01:34:21,601 --> 01:34:23,667
in the vicinity that night.

1534
01:34:25,703 --> 01:34:29,204
So are you sure you
don't wanna take your time?

1535
01:34:31,340 --> 01:34:32,440
Yeah, I don't see him.

Okay.

Did you let that guy off?

1538

I don't know.

1539
01:35:23,455 --> 01:35:24,855

the same, you know.
