I will carry the box.

1106
01:22:04,252 --> 01:22:07,016
It will bring my spare change
great honor.

1107
01:22:07,088 --> 01:22:09,579
Okay, you do that.
You do that.

1108
01:22:09,724 --> 01:22:11,089
<i>Hey, gweilo!</i>

1109
01:22:12,327 --> 01:22:13,988
I just want to say

1110
01:22:16,965 --> 01:22:18,523
no hard feelings, huh?

1111
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,434
<i>Good luck
on the new school, gweilo.</i>

1112
01:22:22,537 --> 01:22:23,902
Thanks, man.

1113
01:22:28,009 --> 01:22:31,035
(SPEAKING CHINESE)

1114
01:22:35,450 --> 01:22:40,012
<i>Dragon say, "May Wong's school of
table tennis last 1,000 years.</i>

1115
01:22:40,088 --> 01:22:42,886
<i>"Or at least until the lease
is up in August."</i>

1116
01:22:43,658 --> 01:22:45,956
Oh, thanks.

1117
01:22:46,027 --> 01:22:48,552
<i>It's nice.
Thank you very much.</i>

1118
01:22:48,630 --> 01:22:51,497
You know, I think we all
learned a valuable lesson.

1119
01:22:57,806 --> 01:23:00,639
<i>Dragon say, "This is
not over yet, whitey!"</i>

1120
01:23:04,846 --> 01:23:06,473
Walk it off, Randy.

1121
01:23:08,183 --> 01:23:14,281
A true Ping-Pong player must always
be aware of his surroundings.

1122
01:23:15,323 --> 01:23:16,312
(THUDDING)

1123
01:23:19,627 --> 01:23:21,527
Master, are you all right?

1124
01:23:22,797 --> 01:23:25,095
WONG:
I am going to Disneyland.

1125
01:23:26,768 --> 01:23:29,430
Maybe we should
keep this closed.

1126
01:23:30,205 --> 01:23:33,504
<i>There's a gate here.
There's a blind man walking around.</i>

1127
01:24:17,152 --> 01:24:18,176
Feng!

1128
01:24:21,022 --> 01:24:22,148
Shit!

1129
01:25:03,131 --> 01:25:05,827
<i>I'm not leaving without you,
Ying-Ying!</i>

1130
01:25:09,871 --> 01:25:11,429
<i>Panda's totally fake.</i>

1131
01:25:53,915 --> 01:25:55,348
Feng, not Fang.

1132
01:25:55,416 --> 01:25:56,974
Feng?
Feng.

1133
01:25:57,051 --> 01:25:59,144
<i>I've been calling you Fang
this whole time.</i>

1134
01:25:59,220 --> 01:26:00,812
F-E-N-G.

1135
01:26:00,889 --> 01:26:01,947
Feng?

1136
01:26:02,023 --> 01:26:03,012
All right.

1137
01:26:03,091 --> 01:26:04,080
Please.
