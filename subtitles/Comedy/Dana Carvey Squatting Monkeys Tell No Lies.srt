This is where it all started.

167
00:09:12,768 --> 00:09:14,268
We found it.

168
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,405
Good for us.

169
00:09:18,441 --> 00:09:23,243
Listen, this is the only
connection we have to Peters.

170
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,863
I need you to help me
find him, Cassie.

171
00:09:25,915 --> 00:09:27,865
[chuckles]

172
00:09:27,917 --> 00:09:30,534
It'll be my pleasure.

173
00:09:32,254 --> 00:09:34,955
I don't think
that's helping you.

174
00:09:35,007 --> 00:09:38,008
If Peters is recreating M5-10
for the 12 Monkeys,

175
00:09:38,043 --> 00:09:39,710
he'll need animals
to test it on.

176
00:09:39,712 --> 00:09:42,129
CDC can get a list
of suppliers,

177
00:09:42,181 --> 00:09:44,681
and then I'll be able
to track him down.

178
00:09:44,717 --> 00:09:47,301
Just like the Big Burn
and the Night Room.

179
00:09:47,353 --> 00:09:49,686
Then splinter,
apocalypse,

181
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:53,190
Hey, what is this?

182
00:09:53,225 --> 00:09:54,975
What are you doing?

183
00:09:55,027 --> 00:09:57,311
You're not supposed
to be here.

You think
I want to be?

Go.
I'll find Peters.

See you soon.

187
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:08,372
Maybe.

188
00:10:08,407 --> 00:10:10,457
What's that
supposed to mean?

189
00:10:10,493 --> 00:10:14,244
Do you think I haven't noticed
the nosebleeds, the headaches?

190
00:10:14,246 --> 00:10:18,966
All this splintering
is killing you, isn't it?

191
00:10:19,001 --> 00:10:21,418

okay?

the White Dragon.

A couple of scavs

Where are they now?

Okay...

Glad you're back.

Where is she?

00:12:19,255 --> 00:12:21,588
- Thank God.
- Hey, you.

214
00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:27,144
When Cole gets back,
they're finished.

215
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:30,397
They're not going to be
splintering anymore.

216
00:12:30,432 --> 00:12:33,767
I wrecked
the place pretty good.

217
00:12:33,819 --> 00:12:35,352
And I got this.

What is that?

219
00:12:37,156 --> 00:12:41,191
They put it in his blood
before he goes in the machine.

220
00:12:41,193 --> 00:12:44,695
Without it,
he can't go back.

221
00:12:44,747 --> 00:12:46,280
They're gonna come
for that.

If they find us,
we have insurance.

But if they get that back,
they'll just try again.

224
00:12:50,953 --> 00:12:55,255
They'll stop the plague,
make it so that we never meet.

You have to trust me.

At least that's what they call

I'm looking for a list

It's a reconditioning system

Why would that matter
if you are successful?

Because getting Ramse killed

We don't have any material

But we also need
Cole's continued cooperation.
