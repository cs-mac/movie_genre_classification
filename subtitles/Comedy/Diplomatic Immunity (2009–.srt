I think I've got my 1:00.

488
00:36:02,894 --> 00:36:06,229
Ean TV has just picked up
this live transmission,

489
00:36:06,231 --> 00:36:09,232
said to be coming from
within the United States embassy

490
00:36:09,234 --> 00:36:11,334
in Bucharest.

491
00:36:12,703 --> 00:36:15,605
I have decided...

492
00:36:15,607 --> 00:36:17,707
That this young man...

493
00:36:17,709 --> 00:36:21,711
Will be my next message to you.

494
00:36:21,713 --> 00:36:25,782
I will shoot him
unless I'm given proof

495
00:36:25,784 --> 00:36:29,319
that colonel vojnovic
has been released...

496
00:36:29,321 --> 00:36:30,954
In, uh...

497
00:36:32,256 --> 00:36:34,424
9 minutes.

498
00:36:34,426 --> 00:36:37,928
Son of a bitch has his own
satellite transmission.

499
00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:38,962
I want nothing

500
00:36:38,964 --> 00:36:40,330
that happens
in that embassy

on the air!

502
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:45,202
Scramble it, and feed it
into our system.

503
00:36:45,204 --> 00:36:46,903
God damn it.

504
00:36:55,279 --> 00:36:58,448
Ok, Tim, we're
at a crossroads. Which way?

505
00:36:58,450 --> 00:37:00,984
And then call me at
the next intersection.

506
00:37:00,986 --> 00:37:03,286
Ok.
go.

507
00:37:04,288 --> 00:37:05,522
Tim: son of a bitch.

508
00:37:05,524 --> 00:37:08,491
Son of a bitch. He's
gonna kill some kid.

509
00:37:08,493 --> 00:37:10,493
I didn't see
a kid down there.

510
00:37:10,495 --> 00:37:12,262
How old is he?

511
00:37:12,264 --> 00:37:13,230
Tim: uh, 13, 14.

512
00:37:13,232 --> 00:37:16,666
What color jacket
has he got on?

513
00:37:16,668 --> 00:37:21,504
Jean jacket,
wearing a walkman.

514
00:37:21,506 --> 00:37:23,273
It's Chris.

515
00:37:23,275 --> 00:37:25,008
What the hell
is he doing there?

516
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:28,745
Steve, you don't follow
protocol here,

517
00:37:28,747 --> 00:37:30,013
I don't have any choice.

518
00:37:30,015 --> 00:37:31,681
Well, you shoot me,

519
00:37:31,683 --> 00:37:34,417
you can't do very much
with that bomb, can you?

520
00:37:34,419 --> 00:37:35,585
I can't do
anything with it

521
00:37:35,587 --> 00:37:37,887
if you leave me alone
here, either.

God damn it, Steve!

523
00:37:40,459 --> 00:37:42,359
We are here for a bomb.

We have to do this.

525
00:37:44,029 --> 00:37:48,031
He's my son, Erica.

526
00:37:48,033 --> 00:37:50,033

I'm in the John

00:38:54,032 --> 00:38:55,932
Tim: all right.
Just sit tight.

530
00:38:55,934 --> 00:38:58,101
I'll let you know
when you're clear.

531
00:38:59,103 --> 00:39:03,540
You have 2 minutes.
I still don't see the colonel.

532

The clock
is still ticking.

What the hell can we do, huh?

With what he's sitting on

536
00:39:12,484 --> 00:39:15,352
and a gun pointed
at a kid's head?

537
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:20,056
They still got
a gun on my kid?

538
00:39:20,058 --> 00:39:22,625
Yeah. a minute 30.

539
00:39:22,627 --> 00:39:25,495
Well, get me there.

we send for vojnovic,

00:42:05,123 --> 00:42:07,857
only to get Goran
out of the embassy.

on war criminals
and terrorists.

How are you gonna
explain to the president

00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:14,797
we let vojnovic out of
jail after just 2 hours?

570
00:42:14,799 --> 00:42:17,066
The president is not gonna
authorize the release

unless we explain why we
have to get that terrorist

we're talking about
an atomic bomb here, gene.

00:48:44,455 --> 00:48:48,224
Well, he finished at the top
of his class at ft. Bragg,

642
00:48:48,226 --> 00:48:52,061
and then trained
by delta command and the CIA.

Serbian parents,
but raised in America.

644
00:48:55,166 --> 00:48:59,468
Ended up heading what's left
of vojnovic's brown hats.

645
00:48:59,470 --> 00:49:02,171
Do they teach what he
knew about that embassy

in bragg, general?

647
00:49:03,541 --> 00:49:05,408
Then how did he
know about it?

01:21:55,945 --> 01:21:57,945
Who is holding
the whole city hostage?

1137
01:21:57,947 --> 01:22:01,448
Now, you're going
to shut that thing down

1138
01:22:01,450 --> 01:22:05,519
and standby while I make
some real demands.

1139
01:22:05,521 --> 01:22:07,087
Uhh!

1140
01:22:16,531 --> 01:22:18,332
Ohh!

1141
01:22:21,603 --> 01:22:23,070
It seems to me

1142
01:22:23,072 --> 01:22:26,407
we both got fucked here.

1143
01:22:26,409 --> 01:22:29,176
Maybe you got it worse.

[Gunshot]

1145
01:23:03,345 --> 01:23:05,145
Ok, Erica.

1146
01:23:06,114 --> 01:23:07,147
The game is over.

1147
01:23:07,149 --> 01:23:08,582
End of the line.

1148
01:23:08,584 --> 01:23:12,386
The jig, baby, is up.

1149
01:23:12,620 --> 01:23:14,455
Now give me the code

1150
01:23:14,457 --> 01:23:16,123
before I kill you.

1151
01:23:16,125 --> 01:23:19,560
You shoot me, you never
get past that bomb.

1152
01:23:19,562 --> 01:23:20,761
Well, I can't do
anything with it

1153
01:23:20,763 --> 01:23:24,665
if you leave me here
alone, either, can I?

1154
01:23:24,667 --> 01:23:26,266
It was never supposed
to go this far,

1155
01:23:26,268 --> 01:23:29,403
but it's too late
to change anything now.

1156
01:23:29,405 --> 01:23:31,472
Erica!

1157
01:23:38,446 --> 01:23:39,313
That's it.

1158
01:23:39,315 --> 01:23:40,614
Ok, get in there.

01:23:40,616 --> 01:23:42,449
Go, go!

01:23:42,451 --> 01:23:46,186

Steve Mitchell?

1161
01:23:47,555 --> 01:23:49,556
Jesus.

01:24:01,170 --> 01:24:02,169
The tunnel
was sealed.

1166
01:24:02,171 --> 01:24:04,605
Take my son
out of here, please!

1167
01:24:04,607 --> 01:24:05,706
Get him out of here!

1168
01:24:05,708 --> 01:24:07,741
Hold it! Hold it!

1169
01:24:07,743 --> 01:24:10,477
Steve: I'm the bomb guy!
Don't shoot!

1170
01:24:10,479 --> 01:24:11,812
I'm with the bomb!

1171
01:24:11,814 --> 01:24:14,715
I got to get to the bomb!

1172
01:24:16,718 --> 01:24:18,485
You try all
the back doors yet?

1173
01:24:18,487 --> 01:24:21,121
Closed out.
I don't get it.

1174
01:24:23,658 --> 01:24:26,727
Damn, she loaded
a virus in it.

1175
01:24:27,695 --> 01:24:28,729
Shit.

1176
01:24:28,731 --> 01:24:31,098
Any other back ways
you know of?

1177
01:24:31,100 --> 01:24:33,534
It's just too late.
Think!

1178
01:24:33,536 --> 01:24:35,669
I'm thinking.
I'm...

1179
01:24:36,604 --> 01:24:39,239
There's only one way to go,
and that's straight up.

1180
01:24:39,241 --> 01:24:41,742
General, I'll make a deal
with you.

1181
01:24:43,511 --> 01:24:46,380
Give me a minute,
will you?

1182
01:24:49,784 --> 01:24:51,652
If you get my kid
off this continent,

1183
01:24:51,654 --> 01:24:54,254
I'll take this thing
out by hand.

1184
01:24:54,256 --> 01:24:55,556
We got about...

1185
01:24:55,558 --> 01:24:57,791
I guess, 90 seconds.

1186
01:24:59,327 --> 01:25:01,328
Do it.

1187
01:25:04,499 --> 01:25:06,767
He's going to take out
the core of the bomb.

1188
01:25:06,769 --> 01:25:09,803
The radiation will melt him
like butter.

shut up!

Go! go!

I know he's doing this for
his country and all that...

1194
01:25:22,685 --> 01:25:26,720
Maybe he's doing it for
all the people this would kill.

1195
01:25:26,722 --> 01:25:30,224
Maybe he's doing it for you.
Think about that.
