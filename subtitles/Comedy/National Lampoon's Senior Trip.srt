1
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:47,796
Whoa, baby.

2
00:02:08,828 --> 00:02:12,423
It's now officially 8:01, people.

3
00:02:12,499 --> 00:02:13,898
Let's move it!

4
00:02:14,934 --> 00:02:18,165
Come on, come on...
while we're young!

5
00:02:19,672 --> 00:02:21,299
Herbert Jones,
get off my car!

6
00:02:28,548 --> 00:02:30,311
Quickly, quickly, quickly.

7
00:02:31,184 --> 00:02:33,709
Come on. Look lively, people. Come on.

8
00:02:35,622 --> 00:02:38,420
Keep climbing...
you won't get a nosebleed.

9
00:02:39,592 --> 00:02:41,617
Button that up, Carla.

10
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:52,668
Herbert. Early Bird. Worm.
Think about it.

11
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:06,343
Pull, Wanda. Pull.

12
00:03:42,288 --> 00:03:44,153
Total destruction.

13
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:46,383
Any harm?

14
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,457
I don't think so.

15
00:03:51,931 --> 00:03:54,092
Wait... there's a scratch.

16
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:55,828
Where, here?

17
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:08,979
People, um, say that acid

18
00:04:09,048 --> 00:04:12,449
causes, um, brain damage.

19
00:04:14,854 --> 00:04:15,946
But, um...

20
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:20,892
- What did you say?
- Hey, what class do we have now?

21
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,491
Math?

22
00:04:31,838 --> 00:04:32,827
Dude.

23
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:36,873
There's nobody in here.

24
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:45,346
Uh... everybody's dead, man.
Nuclear annihilation.

25
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:47,386
D'Agastino and Barry!

26
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:49,011
It's alive.

27
00:04:49,088 --> 00:04:53,047
It's precisely 8:26 and you two dopers
are still roaming the halls.

28
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,753
Why aren't you two
at the assembly?

29
00:04:54,827 --> 00:04:57,091
Principal Moss, we've been
lookin' everywhere for you.

30
00:04:57,163 --> 00:04:58,755
What are you talking about?

31
00:04:58,831 --> 00:05:01,265
This guy just
totally trashed your car.

32
00:05:03,269 --> 00:05:04,827
Not my new Buick?

33
00:05:04,904 --> 00:05:06,303
Yeah.

34
00:05:08,074 --> 00:05:10,201
We tried to chase him and everything,
but he got away.

35
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:16,441
He, um, was wearing
a Billy Joel T-shirt.

36
00:05:18,851 --> 00:05:20,614
Get to the auditorium.

37
00:05:31,964 --> 00:05:33,488
Yes.

38
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:39,301
Look, even though I'm probably
going to get into Yale,

39
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:43,240
doesn't mean that I don't suffer
from the effects of teen angst.

40
00:05:44,043 --> 00:05:45,135
But I'm here to tell you

41
00:05:45,211 --> 00:05:49,375
that drugs and alcohol are not
the answers to your problem...

42
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:55,788
Steve... President Dickhead.

43
00:05:56,289 --> 00:05:58,553
Hey... fuck you, man.

44
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:00,484
Drugs rule!

45
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,470
Thanks for saving me a seat, Lisa.

46
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,608
Shut up!

47
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:26,944
Hey, man, what time's that suit
have to be back?

48
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:31,182
As student body president,
I am proud to bring you

49
00:06:31,257 --> 00:06:33,657
- this special assembly.
- Fuck you, Nisser!

50
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:34,954
So...

51
00:06:35,027 --> 00:06:38,155
without any further ado,
I give to you,

52
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:42,463
direct from Salt Lake City,
the music of High On Life.

53
00:06:45,838 --> 00:06:49,569
Hey, there, Fairmount High.
We're High On Life.

54
00:06:49,642 --> 00:06:52,873
Sponsored by the wonderful people
at Bounty Burger.

55
00:06:52,945 --> 00:06:55,243
Get off, you freak!

56
00:06:56,983 --> 00:06:59,611
Now, I know your teen years
can be hard...

57
00:06:59,685 --> 00:07:01,516
Show us your tits!

58
00:07:03,656 --> 00:07:07,148
But just remember,
you're not alone.

59
00:07:07,226 --> 00:07:10,320
We all need a little love
in our hearts.

60
00:07:10,897 --> 00:07:12,296
Hit it, Jojo.

61
00:07:18,371 --> 00:07:20,134
Go away, you suck!

62
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:24,666
Lift up your fellow man,
lend 'em a helping hand

63
00:07:24,744 --> 00:07:27,474
Put a little love in your heart

64
00:07:27,547 --> 00:07:28,912
They look like Abba.

65
00:07:28,981 --> 00:07:33,680
If you see it's getting late
Oh, please don't hesitate

66
00:07:33,753 --> 00:07:36,620
Put a little love in your heart

67
00:07:37,223 --> 00:07:39,487
This sucks.

68
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,121
We have to save the assembly.

69
00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:46,725
Let's do some Van Damme-age.

70
00:07:48,267 --> 00:07:50,667
Will be a better place

71
00:07:50,736 --> 00:07:52,761
And the world

72
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:55,137
Will be a better place

73
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:57,403
For you

74
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:58,637
And me

75
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:08,384
- AV man.
- What?

76
00:08:08,454 --> 00:08:10,479
Hey, guys. What's up?

77
00:08:10,556 --> 00:08:15,050
Virus Man, we have to do something
about this lip-syncing shit.

78
00:08:15,127 --> 00:08:17,493
Cool! Whaddya got in mind?

79
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,758
Put a little

80
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:25,463
Put a little love in your heart

81
00:08:26,072 --> 00:08:28,302
Put a little love...

82
00:08:57,803 --> 00:08:59,771
What is going on here?

83
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:09,946
Calm down, now.

84
00:09:10,016 --> 00:09:11,813
Let's settle down...

85
00:09:19,258 --> 00:09:20,919
Repent!

86
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,424
Why are you doing this to me?

87
00:09:25,498 --> 00:09:27,898
I only want to help you!

88
00:09:32,471 --> 00:09:35,235
Now, now, now. Calm down.
It's gonna be okay.

89
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:37,299
Let got of me.
I've gotta get out of here.

90
00:09:50,456 --> 00:09:53,584
What the hell is going on here?!

91
00:09:54,794 --> 00:09:57,285
Superb assembly,
Principal Moss.

92
00:09:58,965 --> 00:10:02,025
A, space.

93
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:05,264
B, space.

94
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:07,499
Space.

95
00:10:07,573 --> 00:10:11,100
C, space.

96
00:10:11,177 --> 00:10:14,669
D, space. Space.

97
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:21,043
Hey! How do you get
this thing to work, man?

98
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:33,992
I say we're due for another
Senior Class party.

99
00:10:34,066 --> 00:10:35,829
This computer sucks.

100
00:10:35,901 --> 00:10:37,027
Hey, Reggie.

101
00:10:39,438 --> 00:10:42,032
Pretty cool how we
trashed the assembly, huh?

102
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:43,598
What are you talking about?

103
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:46,938
Nothing. Nothing.

104
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:57,218
Um, where are we gonna have it?

105
00:10:57,289 --> 00:10:59,780
How about your
step-monster's place, 'kay?

106
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:03,693
No, no, no. This calls for something
with a higher degree of difficulty.

107
00:11:11,137 --> 00:11:12,866
Lisa.

108
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:16,699
- Lisa, Lisa, Lisa, Lisa.
- What?!

109
00:11:16,776 --> 00:11:18,835
You wanna cut and go to a party?

110
00:11:20,312 --> 00:11:21,438
Come on.

111
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:23,539
I know you like me.

112
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:26,014
Would you leave me alone?

113
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:28,349
I am concerned about you, Lisa.

114
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:30,082
You're gonna wake up one day

115
00:11:30,156 --> 00:11:33,387
and realize that you wasted all of
your high school years studying.

116
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:36,189
And you're gonna wake up
and realize you're a loser.

117
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:45,234
Q...

118
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,768
See you tomorrow, Mr. Bloom.

119
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,034
Go.

120
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:25,100
Go.

121
00:12:25,644 --> 00:12:26,633
Go.

122
00:12:27,313 --> 00:12:31,613
Don't worry. I'm a professional,
I know exactly what I'm doing. Go.

123
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,618
The cars will stop. Go!

124
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:38,979
Mom!

125
00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:43,451
They never listen to me.

126
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:46,225
Fools. Never listen to me.

127
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:48,558
Never, never...

128
00:12:52,071 --> 00:12:55,802
Hey, dude. You know how to
get to 237 Stratford Road?

129
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:00,635
Dude, how about Sterling Ridge Lane?

130
00:13:02,548 --> 00:13:03,708
He doesn't know.

131
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:07,784
What do you mean, he doesn't know?
He's a crossing guard.

132
00:13:07,853 --> 00:13:09,684
Hey, dickhead!

133
00:13:09,755 --> 00:13:12,747
Don't you even know your way
around the neighborhood?

134
00:13:13,225 --> 00:13:15,352
- That's it!
- Go! Go! Go!

135
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:18,456
Stop!

136
00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:20,294
- Later, psycho.
- Pull over!

137
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:22,197
Nice job, buddy.

138
00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:25,730
Get a life, loser!

139
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:28,000
Stop! Stop!

140
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:29,869
Stop!

141
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:33,401
I said stop!

142
00:13:41,253 --> 00:13:42,447
Come in.

143
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,924
Yes, Mrs. Winston?

144
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:48,459
Hello.

145
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:51,825
Yes?

146
00:13:52,965 --> 00:13:55,399
I forgot why I knocked.

147
00:14:00,806 --> 00:14:04,139
Mrs. Winston, are those cut slips
you're holding?

148
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:11,176
My late husband once wrote
a little poem called "Little..."

149
00:14:12,918 --> 00:14:16,649
Yeah, must be
another senior skip day.

150
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:20,723
D'Agastino thinks
he can outsmart me.

151
00:14:21,894 --> 00:14:24,055
Not in <i>my</i> domain.

152
00:14:33,105 --> 00:14:34,094
Hey.

153
00:14:49,588 --> 00:14:50,680
What's up?

154
00:14:53,859 --> 00:14:55,656
Cool party, man.

155
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:58,288
Oh, I have a mission for you.

156
00:14:58,364 --> 00:15:01,424
You want me to
torch the principal's house, huh?

157
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:07,532
Okay. But, uh, first,
we need provisions, man.

158
00:15:10,609 --> 00:15:12,440
Oh, okay.

159
00:15:12,511 --> 00:15:14,274
Hey, guys, beer run.

160
00:15:22,688 --> 00:15:26,021
Wouldn't it be cool to screw
in the principal's bedroom?

161
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:34,691
Uh, hold that thought.

162
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:37,762
Well, what are you doing here?

163
00:15:37,836 --> 00:15:40,270
This is a senior class party,
isn't it?

164
00:15:41,173 --> 00:15:44,165
- Yeah.
- Well, then I'm in the right place.

165
00:15:53,018 --> 00:15:55,145
What is it, Steve?

166
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:58,121
Sir, I thought you might
want to take a look at this.

167
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:00,784
I found it on the floor
of my science class.

168
00:16:06,365 --> 00:16:09,334
"Dags and Reggie invite you

169
00:16:09,401 --> 00:16:12,302
to total destruction."

170
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:18,439
"Twelve o'clock.
237 Stratford Road."

171
00:16:19,845 --> 00:16:22,040
That's your house, sir.

172
00:16:25,184 --> 00:16:29,086
I know you.
You're that smart girl.

173
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:32,357
You wanna get high?

174
00:16:32,424 --> 00:16:34,221
No, thank you.

175
00:16:45,871 --> 00:16:47,304
How's it goin', Lisa?

176
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:52,071
- Are you out of your mind?
- What's the matter?

177
00:16:52,144 --> 00:16:55,705
- This is Principal Moss's house.
- Don't worry about it.

178
00:16:55,781 --> 00:16:58,306
The party's gonna end at 3:00,
we'll clean up, he'll never know.

179
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:02,617
Miosky! Miosky!

180
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,987
I'm not gettin' busted for this.

181
00:17:22,775 --> 00:17:25,141
Surprise!

182
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,576
Happy birthday.

183
00:17:37,823 --> 00:17:41,554
You think you're so funny,
don't you, D'Agastino?

184
00:17:41,627 --> 00:17:45,256
Well, none of your friends are laughing!
They know you're the reason

185
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:47,924
they're spending a Saturday
in detention.

186
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,524
It's not my fault.

187
00:17:49,601 --> 00:17:52,570
Well, then who <i>is</i> responsible for
the mess in my house?

188
00:17:57,709 --> 00:17:59,267
The school system.

189
00:17:59,344 --> 00:18:02,006
Oh. Oh, oh, oh.

190
00:18:02,714 --> 00:18:05,205
And how is it
the school system's fault?

191
00:18:06,285 --> 00:18:08,185
Well, um...

192
00:18:11,323 --> 00:18:15,123
...the whole reason why I threw the party,
Principal Moss, is because...

193
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:16,718
We're fed up.

194
00:18:16,795 --> 00:18:18,490
Yeah. We're adults, you know,

195
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:21,533
and you just keep bombarding us
with your rules.

196
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,400
Stop treating us like kids.
We are fully developed human beings.

197
00:18:25,471 --> 00:18:27,598
You teachers are so out of touch.

198
00:18:27,673 --> 00:18:30,369
We don't need this
"A, space, J, space,

199
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:33,639
Put A Little Love In Your Heart shit."
We need a challenge.

200
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:36,480
You guys have to rethink
this whole education thing.

201
00:18:36,548 --> 00:18:39,449
It's just not working.
Now, I'm not saying it's your fault.

202
00:18:39,518 --> 00:18:42,282
I'm not blaming you.
You're just a pawn in the game.

203
00:18:42,354 --> 00:18:45,084
- It's the government, man.
- The government sucks.

204
00:18:46,992 --> 00:18:48,823
Well, uh...

205
00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:53,524
...now that you've enlightened me
as to the real problem here,

206
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:56,966
perhaps you should tell the President
about your concerns.

207
00:18:57,035 --> 00:19:00,903
In fact, I think you should all
pool your ideas together.

208
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:04,636
I want you to draft
a 500-word letter to the President

209
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:07,178
on what you'd like
the government to do

210
00:19:07,246 --> 00:19:10,807
in order to save
our education system.

211
00:19:13,452 --> 00:19:16,444
Now, Mr. Diplo will be
in charge today.

212
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:19,286
Mr. Diplo, I've given these students
an assignment.

213
00:19:19,358 --> 00:19:22,156
Make sure they finish it by one o'clock.

214
00:19:22,227 --> 00:19:26,527
If they're not finished,
they can stay later.

215
00:19:27,399 --> 00:19:30,391
I know just how to
handle these students, sir.

216
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:33,201
Okay, lights.

217
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:36,400
Can you guys keep it down?
I'm trying to write the letter.

218
00:19:36,475 --> 00:19:39,774
Five, four, three,

219
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:42,541
two, one.

220
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:56,855
<i>Aw, come on, Susie.</i>
<i>Everybody does it.</i>

221
00:19:56,929 --> 00:19:59,193
<i>I don't know, Fast Eddie.</i>

222
00:19:59,264 --> 00:20:01,994
<i>Don't you think we should</i>
<i>use a prophylactic?</i>

223
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:07,195
<i>Don't worry.</i>

224
00:20:07,272 --> 00:20:09,502
<i>I'll pull out at the last minute.</i>

225
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:13,744
Do it! Do it!

226
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:16,078
Don't do it! No!

227
00:20:22,754 --> 00:20:26,155
- It's <i>my</i> doctor!
- <i>Well, Susie...</i>

228
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:28,853
<i>... it looks like</i>
<i>you're going to be a mother.</i>

229
00:20:31,196 --> 00:20:33,858
<i>Don't worry, I'll pull out.</i>

230
00:20:33,932 --> 00:20:35,900
<i>Don't worry, I'II...</i>

231
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:44,842
What happened?

232
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,571
<i>Because of her pregnancy,</i>

233
00:20:46,645 --> 00:20:48,875
<i>Susie was forced</i>
<i>to drop out of school</i>

234
00:20:48,947 --> 00:20:52,781
<i>and never fulfilled her dream</i>
<i>of one day becoming a secretary.</i>

235
00:20:52,851 --> 00:20:54,409
Poor Susie!

236
00:20:54,486 --> 00:20:56,283
<i>So you see, boys and girls,</i>

237
00:20:56,355 --> 00:20:59,688
- <i>teen pregnancy is no joke.</i>
- Four stars. This is great.

238
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:07,227
<i>Senator, the President</i>
<i>is on the phone.</i>

239
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:10,325
What does that liberal wuss
want today?

240
00:21:13,739 --> 00:21:15,866
Good morning, Mr. President.

241
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:18,375
<i>Senator Lerman,</i>
<i>I just finished reading a letter</i>

242
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:20,274
<i>from some students</i>
<i>from your state</i>

243
00:21:20,345 --> 00:21:22,870
<i>expressing their concern</i>
<i>over our education system.</i>

244
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:24,381
Uh-huh.

245
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:27,179
<i>This is one of the most intelligent</i>
<i>letters I've ever read.</i>

246
00:21:27,252 --> 00:21:28,776
Wonderful, sir.

247
00:21:28,854 --> 00:21:32,119
<i>So I think it'd be a terrific idea to</i>
<i>invite these students to Washington</i>

248
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:33,919
<i>to speak on behalf of my bill.</i>

249
00:21:33,992 --> 00:21:37,155
<i>I want you to fly to Ohio</i>
<i>and give them my personal invitation.</i>

250
00:21:37,229 --> 00:21:39,925
Certainly, Mr. President. I'll leave
first thing in the morning.

251
00:21:39,998 --> 00:21:42,364
<i>I appreciate that, Senator.</i>
<i>Good day.</i>

252
00:21:42,434 --> 00:21:44,493
Good day to you...

253
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:46,366
...asshole.

254
00:21:49,241 --> 00:21:52,142
"President's education care..."

255
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:58,377
I appreciate you picking me up
at the train station, Principal Moss.

256
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:01,214
I'm very excited about
getting the opportunity to teach.

257
00:22:01,286 --> 00:22:05,222
- I really think I can make a difference.
- It's just a typing class, Miss Milford.

258
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:09,818
Stick to Mr. Bloom's curriculum,
and we'll all get along just fine.

259
00:22:10,862 --> 00:22:12,056
What the fuck?!

260
00:22:20,972 --> 00:22:23,907
- Mrs. Winston, what's going on?
- Hello.

261
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:28,940
- Why are the police here?
- That's why I came out here.

262
00:22:31,116 --> 00:22:32,105
Yes?

263
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:35,642
Senator Lerman is visiting
some of the students.

264
00:22:35,721 --> 00:22:37,154
Which students?

265
00:22:37,222 --> 00:22:39,884
D'Agastino and some of his buddies.

266
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:41,755
Oh, my God!

267
00:22:41,827 --> 00:22:44,728
They're with the press right now.

268
00:22:44,796 --> 00:22:45,922
Where are they?

269
00:22:46,732 --> 00:22:48,063
Where are they?!

270
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:52,893
Senator Lerman is visiting
some of the students...

271
00:22:54,306 --> 00:22:58,504
I think it's a proud day
for Fairmount high

272
00:22:58,577 --> 00:23:05,676
that the President has asked these
fine, upstanding students

273
00:23:05,751 --> 00:23:08,914
to speak on behalf
of his education reform bill.

274
00:23:08,987 --> 00:23:14,289
We need bright young leaders
for the future of this nation.

275
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:18,090
Who else is better to comment on this
country's educational problems

276
00:23:18,163 --> 00:23:20,222
than the students themselves?

277
00:23:20,298 --> 00:23:24,325
By golly, I think the President has really
hit a home run on this one!

278
00:23:25,303 --> 00:23:28,898
Is this a bipartisan effort
on behalf of you and the President?

279
00:23:28,974 --> 00:23:32,466
No, no, I...
I cannot take any credit for this.

280
00:23:32,544 --> 00:23:35,104
This is the President's decision.

281
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:37,671
I had nothing to do
with this whatsoever.

282
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:39,649
I am only an errand boy.

283
00:23:39,718 --> 00:23:41,948
Now, if that's all, ladies and gentlemen,

284
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:45,217
I will see you all in Washington.
Buy American.

285
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:47,383
Senator, one more question!

286
00:23:53,698 --> 00:23:56,292
Senator Lerman,
I'm Principal Moss.

287
00:23:56,368 --> 00:23:59,064
I'm sorry I wasn't at the meeting.
I was picking somebody up.

288
00:23:59,137 --> 00:24:02,300
You just make sure those kids
are down in Washington in two days.

289
00:24:02,374 --> 00:24:04,638
Washington?
They're going to Washington?

290
00:24:04,709 --> 00:24:07,769
That's the plan. They're speaking
on behalf of the President.

291
00:24:08,747 --> 00:24:11,147
May I suggest some other students?

292
00:24:11,216 --> 00:24:13,810
No, sir. Those are the students
who wrote the letter,

293
00:24:13,885 --> 00:24:16,445
those are the students
the President wants...

294
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:23,151
...and those are the students
our President is going to get.

295
00:24:24,429 --> 00:24:25,828
No excuses.

296
00:24:25,897 --> 00:24:29,697
You get those kids to Washington,
or it's your ass. Got it?

297
00:24:32,103 --> 00:24:34,435
- Yes, sir.
- Have a nice day.

298
00:24:39,344 --> 00:24:41,039
Let's go, son.

299
00:24:43,215 --> 00:24:46,343
Oh, yes, yes.

300
00:24:49,588 --> 00:24:51,419
Frank Hardin, please.

301
00:24:52,691 --> 00:24:56,957
Frank, Lerman here.
Now, listen up, old friend.

302
00:24:57,028 --> 00:25:01,795
The President has just
set himself up for a major downfall.

303
00:25:01,867 --> 00:25:04,199
And I do mean major.

304
00:25:04,269 --> 00:25:08,399
Now, I see this as a perfect opportunity
to make a lot of money.

305
00:25:08,473 --> 00:25:12,136
Would you be interested
in a little proposition?

306
00:25:13,144 --> 00:25:16,443
Great. I'll call you as soon
as I get to Washington.

307
00:25:20,385 --> 00:25:24,082
You boys get off your bikes
and get to class!

308
00:25:24,789 --> 00:25:27,155
Get going!

309
00:25:27,225 --> 00:25:28,419
Scat!

310
00:25:29,461 --> 00:25:30,792
Assholes!

311
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:36,231
I guess you're wondering
why I asked you here

312
00:25:36,301 --> 00:25:37,928
in the middle of the night.

313
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:45,532
I need a...

314
00:25:46,411 --> 00:25:49,539
...special favor from you, Steve.

315
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:52,410
Something that'll be...

316
00:25:52,484 --> 00:25:54,179
...our little secret.

317
00:25:54,252 --> 00:25:55,719
You up to it?

318
00:26:01,793 --> 00:26:03,385
What are you doing?

319
00:26:03,461 --> 00:26:04,894
I thought you...

320
00:26:04,963 --> 00:26:07,397
- I don't want that, you idiot!
- Sorry, sir.

321
00:26:08,266 --> 00:26:11,030
I need a narc
on the trip to Washington.

322
00:26:11,102 --> 00:26:15,232
- What's in it for me?
- How about meeting the President?

323
00:26:15,307 --> 00:26:17,138
The President...

324
00:26:17,208 --> 00:26:19,438
that would almost assure
my acceptance into Yale!

325
00:26:19,511 --> 00:26:20,603
Exactly.

326
00:26:22,013 --> 00:26:24,743
I need you to befriend D'Agastino
and his buddies

327
00:26:24,816 --> 00:26:27,683
and report everything
they do back to me.

328
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:29,686
You can count on me, sir.

329
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:31,346
Excellent.

330
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:35,655
We have to do everything possible to
make sure nothing weird happens.

331
00:26:43,501 --> 00:26:48,097
Captain's log 94237.4.

332
00:26:48,173 --> 00:26:50,733
I've just received
a priority communication

333
00:26:50,809 --> 00:26:52,401
from Starfleet Command

334
00:26:52,477 --> 00:26:55,139
that an alliance between
the Klingons and the Romulans

335
00:26:55,213 --> 00:26:57,841
will occur right here on Earth.

336
00:26:59,884 --> 00:27:03,320
Our mission: to infiltrate
the Klingon crew

337
00:27:03,388 --> 00:27:06,118
and to kidnap the Romulan leader.

338
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:10,986
Computer, scan file
on Klingon crew.

339
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:17,033
Computer, identify Klingon leader.

340
00:27:21,906 --> 00:27:24,704
Just as I thought.

341
00:27:26,411 --> 00:27:29,141
Computer, identify
Romulan leader.

342
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:34,808
Mr. Spock, your analysis?

343
00:27:40,025 --> 00:27:42,550
I agree. We have to stop 'em.

344
00:27:44,229 --> 00:27:48,029
Lieutenant Uhura, accompany me
to the transporter.

345
00:27:58,309 --> 00:28:01,278
Mr. Spock, you have the bridge.

346
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:09,252
I told the bus company to
have him here at precisely 7:30.

347
00:28:16,561 --> 00:28:17,653
Is that our bus?

348
00:28:31,443 --> 00:28:33,343
You guys going to Washington?

349
00:28:33,411 --> 00:28:34,708
Yeah!

350
00:28:34,779 --> 00:28:36,337
That's the driver?

351
00:28:36,414 --> 00:28:38,974
Name's Red, man.
Sorry I'm late.

352
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:40,813
We're never gonna make it
to Washington alive.

353
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:42,079
Come on, hop in.

354
00:28:42,153 --> 00:28:43,620
Hey, let's go!

355
00:28:48,026 --> 00:28:49,084
Shotgun.

356
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:56,197
Hi. Tracey Milford,
teacher and chaperone.

357
00:28:56,267 --> 00:28:59,327
Well, welcome aboard.
Just grab a seat.

358
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:00,928
Thank you.

359
00:29:01,005 --> 00:29:03,769
Hey, hold it.
Where do you think you're goin'?

360
00:29:03,842 --> 00:29:05,707
I'm getting on the bus.

361
00:29:05,777 --> 00:29:09,508
You're on the wrong bus, dude.
This is the magic bus.

362
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:12,573
I'm counting on you
to stick to the schedule.

363
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:14,550
It's precisely...

364
00:29:14,619 --> 00:29:18,146
...8:06. Let's get going.

365
00:29:20,959 --> 00:29:23,257
Principal Dickhead.

366
00:29:24,362 --> 00:29:26,091
Well, let's rock 'n' roll!

367
00:29:31,503 --> 00:29:33,903
Yeah! Washington!

368
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:37,799
Shuttlecraft to Enterprise.

369
00:29:38,243 --> 00:29:40,575
Opening shuttle bay doors.

370
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:51,353
Cloaking device down.

371
00:29:54,025 --> 00:29:58,189
Welcome aboard, Lieutenant.
Shuttlecraft disengage.

372
00:30:06,771 --> 00:30:07,897
Chocolate?

373
00:30:09,207 --> 00:30:11,198
Uh, no, thanks. I'm driving.

374
00:30:17,949 --> 00:30:19,041
No.

375
00:30:33,431 --> 00:30:34,489
Really?

376
00:30:45,577 --> 00:30:46,635
Dags.

377
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,169
Thanks, Virus.

378
00:31:10,435 --> 00:31:11,925
Dags...

379
00:31:13,104 --> 00:31:15,971
I just saw that psycho
crossing guard guy

380
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,338
in a car with Lieutenant Uhura.

381
00:31:19,244 --> 00:31:20,973
Sure, dude.

382
00:31:40,164 --> 00:31:43,395
Mama talkin' to me
tryin' to tell me how to live...

383
00:31:51,943 --> 00:31:53,638
- Hey, Virus.
- Hey.

384
00:31:53,711 --> 00:31:55,702
Let me get your advice on something.

385
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:57,543
- Really?
- Yeah.

386
00:31:57,615 --> 00:31:58,912
Yeah. Yeah, sure, Dags.

387
00:31:58,983 --> 00:32:01,213
What do you think
about Lisa Perkins?

388
00:32:01,286 --> 00:32:03,777
I mean, she's lookin'
really good, huh?

389
00:32:03,855 --> 00:32:07,951
- Perkins is a head case, man.
- How do you know that?

390
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:12,489
I did her last year on the Math Club trip.
She want totally psycho on me.

391
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:15,831
- You did Lisa Perkins?
- Yeah.

392
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:18,562
But, you know, don't ask her.
She'll just deny it, you know.

393
00:32:19,337 --> 00:32:22,602
- If I were you, I'd go for Meg.
- Meg's gay.

394
00:32:22,674 --> 00:32:26,872
Yeah, but if anyone can change her,
you can, Dags. Yeah!

395
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:29,880
- I don't think so, Virus.
- You know what I want to do?

396
00:32:30,548 --> 00:32:32,277
- It speaks.
- It speaks.

397
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:34,317
I want to do a Jap.

398
00:32:34,385 --> 00:32:37,377
Hey, what about Carla Morgan?
I think she's half-Jewish.

399
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:41,755
Not that kind of Jap.
A real Jap... from China.

400
00:32:41,826 --> 00:32:45,262
With silky-soft skin, almond eyes,

401
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:47,798
and long, straight, blond hair.

402
00:32:47,865 --> 00:32:50,197
A blond Japanese.

403
00:32:53,204 --> 00:32:56,401
They're a rare breed,
but they're out there...

404
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:58,408
and I'm gonna find one.

405
00:33:09,554 --> 00:33:11,488
If you all check your itineraries,

406
00:33:11,556 --> 00:33:14,081
you'll see that this is
the only stop we're making

407
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:16,092
between now and Washington.

408
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:19,618
So I suggest you take care of
whatever necessities come to mind.

409
00:33:19,697 --> 00:33:21,426
Like takin' a whiz.

410
00:33:23,534 --> 00:33:27,026
Now, I'm setting the alarm
on my watch for ten minutes.

411
00:33:27,105 --> 00:33:29,699
When this alarm goes off
the bus will leave,

412
00:33:29,774 --> 00:33:31,901
with or without you.

413
00:33:33,611 --> 00:33:35,511
Pop quiz, hotshot.

414
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:39,016
You have ten underage students
craving alcoholic beverages

415
00:33:39,083 --> 00:33:42,484
in a store containing
your high school principal.

416
00:33:42,553 --> 00:33:44,453
What do you do?

417
00:33:45,123 --> 00:33:46,988
What do you do?

418
00:33:48,593 --> 00:33:50,288
Take out the principal.

419
00:33:57,435 --> 00:34:00,598
Hey! I want no trouble from
you people! You hear me? Behave!

420
00:34:01,973 --> 00:34:04,703
I hate when I get blamed for something
before I do anything wrong.

421
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:08,243
Hey! And you two girls...
what are you doing?

422
00:34:08,312 --> 00:34:10,143
Move away from there!

423
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:12,148
Hey! Put that down!

424
00:34:18,489 --> 00:34:21,049
The mouse has entered the trap.

425
00:34:21,125 --> 00:34:24,356
- Time?
- Seven minutes and counting.

426
00:34:35,006 --> 00:34:37,998
- Hey, what are you...
- I'm getting my food!

427
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:39,873
It wasn't my fault!

428
00:35:04,836 --> 00:35:06,133
Damnit!

429
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:18,509
Okay.

430
00:35:37,368 --> 00:35:41,668
In seventh grade, my Aunt Jennifer
took me aside one day

431
00:35:41,739 --> 00:35:45,641
and she said, "Tracy, one day
you're gonna grow up and be a teacher...

432
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:47,507
and a darned good one!"

433
00:35:50,381 --> 00:35:53,782
And then in eighth grade...
oh, wow...

434
00:36:31,088 --> 00:36:32,487
Mission accomplished.

435
00:36:33,257 --> 00:36:35,851
- Where's Reggie?
- Bringin' the last load.

436
00:36:45,403 --> 00:36:47,166
Come on, Reggie,
Moss is coming!

437
00:36:47,238 --> 00:36:48,830
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

438
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:54,867
Sit down.

439
00:37:00,484 --> 00:37:01,712
Open the door.

440
00:37:01,786 --> 00:37:04,584
I'm sorry, man,
we got a schedule to keep.

441
00:37:08,993 --> 00:37:10,187
Open the door!

442
00:37:11,128 --> 00:37:12,993
What's the magic word?

443
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:15,032
Open the door!

444
00:37:15,099 --> 00:37:17,090
What's the magic word?

445
00:37:17,168 --> 00:37:18,157
Please!

446
00:37:20,805 --> 00:37:23,831
The magic word's
"rock 'n' roll," man.

447
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:30,813
What happened to you?
Did you piss all over yourself?

448
00:37:40,424 --> 00:37:41,755
Carry on.

449
00:37:55,006 --> 00:37:56,496
Travis.

450
00:37:58,976 --> 00:38:02,343
Yes, Admiral Kirk. I understand.
Travis out.

451
00:38:04,248 --> 00:38:06,113
New orders from Starfleet.

452
00:38:06,183 --> 00:38:09,641
The Klingon leader
is to be terminated.

453
00:38:11,055 --> 00:38:13,717
Phasers on "kill," Lieutenant...

454
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:15,691
phasers on "kill."

455
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:38,946
I shall put an end
to your dirty Klingon ways.

456
00:39:17,788 --> 00:39:20,450
Tell me, how you gonna make
my Bounty Burgers richer

457
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:22,549
with this education care package?

458
00:39:22,626 --> 00:39:26,722
Simple. Once this busload of retards
hit Washington,

459
00:39:26,797 --> 00:39:28,731
the President's gonna look like
such a moron that no one

460
00:39:28,799 --> 00:39:31,131
in their right mind
is going to back his bill.

461
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:32,669
That's when I introduce

462
00:39:32,737 --> 00:39:35,365
the Senator Lerman
education reform bill.

463
00:39:35,439 --> 00:39:36,804
That's all fine and dandy,

464
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:39,274
but I could give two diddlies
about education reform.

465
00:39:40,611 --> 00:39:42,909
Frank, what if there was
a clause in my bill

466
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:46,381
that states that Bounty Burger
is going to replace the cafeterias

467
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:48,884
in all the public schools?

468
00:39:48,953 --> 00:39:52,411
Bounty Burger in every school
would make me billions.

469
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:55,058
It's all outlined in here.

470
00:40:01,832 --> 00:40:04,198
What's this gonna cost me, Lerman?

471
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:09,468
Just a meaningful donation
to my bid for the presidency.

472
00:40:10,541 --> 00:40:14,204
You can look on it
as an investment in America.

473
00:40:17,047 --> 00:40:19,106
Over the river
and through the woods

474
00:40:19,183 --> 00:40:21,583
To Grandmother's house we go,
hey!

475
00:40:21,652 --> 00:40:24,143
The horse knows the way
to carry the sleigh

476
00:40:24,221 --> 00:40:26,155
Through the white
and drifted snow

477
00:40:26,223 --> 00:40:27,383
Hey, look!

478
00:40:39,403 --> 00:40:43,430
'Afternoon. Listen, I'm having
a little car trouble.

479
00:40:44,408 --> 00:40:46,239
Could you give us a lift?

480
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:48,502
Are you going to the convention?

481
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:54,209
- Yes.
- So are we.

482
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:55,411
Climb in.

483
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:10,631
Are you all right?
You look terrible.

484
00:41:10,701 --> 00:41:14,501
Sometimes I get a little carsick.
I'll be fine.

485
00:41:14,572 --> 00:41:17,564
- Maybe we should pull over.
- No. No pulling over.

486
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:20,405
I'm not going to
throw us off schedule.

487
00:41:21,712 --> 00:41:23,179
Students!

488
00:41:23,247 --> 00:41:24,509
Students!

489
00:41:24,582 --> 00:41:27,312
Could you please
keep the noise down to a hush?

490
00:41:27,384 --> 00:41:29,875
Principal Moss is feeling very ill.

491
00:41:30,921 --> 00:41:33,287
Puke! Puke! Puke!

492
00:41:34,592 --> 00:41:38,153
I'm not going to be sick,
and we're not stopping the bus.

493
00:41:40,664 --> 00:41:42,461
Principal Moss is gonna puke!

494
00:41:42,533 --> 00:41:44,296
I wish there was something
I could do.

495
00:41:44,368 --> 00:41:47,235
Here, man.
Give him one of these.

496
00:41:47,304 --> 00:41:48,703
What are they?

497
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:52,338
It's a carsick pill.

498
00:41:53,544 --> 00:41:57,002
- Little large, isn't it?
- Yeah, well, it's, uh...

499
00:41:57,081 --> 00:41:59,072
...it's a bus-sick pill.

500
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:03,611
Hey, take it, man.
Look, it's all natural. See?

501
00:42:06,557 --> 00:42:07,751
Thank you.

502
00:42:12,997 --> 00:42:15,557
Feeling better already,
aren't you?

503
00:42:35,586 --> 00:42:40,046
Travis to Excelsior.
I have Klingon vessel in sight.

504
00:42:40,958 --> 00:42:43,222
Follow that bus, Mr. Sulu.

505
00:42:43,294 --> 00:42:45,854
Sulu? I'm Mr. Woo.

506
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:49,093
I see... traitors to the Federation!

507
00:42:49,166 --> 00:42:51,532
- God, no!
- Nobody move!

508
00:42:51,602 --> 00:42:52,728
Hey, don't shoot!

509
00:42:52,803 --> 00:42:55,829
- Is that a Walther PPK semi-automatic?
- Yes.

510
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:58,469
I'll cover Mom.

511
00:42:58,542 --> 00:43:01,272
Full speed ahead, traitor.

512
00:43:13,357 --> 00:43:15,325
Principal Moss.

513
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:18,721
Principal Moss.

514
00:43:18,796 --> 00:43:20,593
Principal Moss!

515
00:43:21,098 --> 00:43:22,963
Is he dead?

516
00:43:23,033 --> 00:43:26,127
No, he ain't dead, man.
He's just in a coma.

517
00:43:26,203 --> 00:43:27,397
What?!

518
00:43:27,471 --> 00:43:30,338
I guess that carsick pill's
workin' on him.

519
00:43:30,941 --> 00:43:33,876
It should, man, it's a red.

520
00:43:34,845 --> 00:43:36,506
Horse tranquilizer.

521
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:38,775
But I saw you take
a handful of them.

522
00:43:38,849 --> 00:43:40,441
They don't work on me, man.

523
00:43:40,517 --> 00:43:42,917
That's why they call me Red...
I'm immune.

524
00:43:42,987 --> 00:43:44,477
You wanna play cards, or what?

525
00:43:46,056 --> 00:43:47,421
Hey!

526
00:43:47,491 --> 00:43:50,824
Moss is in a coma.
Let's party!

527
00:43:57,267 --> 00:43:58,962
Rock 'n' roll!

528
00:44:14,351 --> 00:44:16,216
Heroin, huh?

529
00:44:18,255 --> 00:44:19,517
Insulin.

530
00:44:20,057 --> 00:44:23,117
Can I, like, buy some off you?

531
00:44:30,534 --> 00:44:33,059
Looks like my good qualities
are beating my bad qualities.

532
00:44:33,137 --> 00:44:34,161
Shit!

533
00:44:34,238 --> 00:44:37,071
Oh, hey! Hey, hey, hey!
Calm down. Calm down.

534
00:44:38,409 --> 00:44:41,606
Hey, look. I think It's time
that you and I called a truce.

535
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:42,771
What do you say?

536
00:44:43,814 --> 00:44:45,281
Cool.

537
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:47,214
Look, so why don't you
dump your books

538
00:44:47,284 --> 00:44:49,411
and come back
and party with us?

539
00:44:50,421 --> 00:44:52,946
- I can't.
- Why not?

540
00:44:53,023 --> 00:44:54,513
Nobody likes me.

541
00:44:54,591 --> 00:44:57,253
- That's not true.
- Yes, it is.

542
00:44:58,595 --> 00:45:01,063
Everybody thinks
I'm a frigid head case.

543
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:05,801
Well, Virus and Reggie do,
but I don't.

544
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:09,896
Look, you could prove 'em wrong by
coming back and partying with us.

545
00:45:12,843 --> 00:45:14,435
Okay...

546
00:45:14,511 --> 00:45:15,978
I can be fun.

547
00:45:17,181 --> 00:45:18,375
All right.

548
00:45:18,449 --> 00:45:21,509
- Hey, look who's joining us!
- Hi, guys.

549
00:45:22,686 --> 00:45:24,711
Doesn't he look pretty?

550
00:45:24,788 --> 00:45:28,781
Oh, that's much better, man.
Much better.

551
00:45:30,294 --> 00:45:33,457
He's my pretty little principal.

552
00:45:33,697 --> 00:45:35,164
Hey, look!

553
00:45:35,799 --> 00:45:40,395
Carla! Carla!
Carla! Carla!

554
00:45:49,046 --> 00:45:51,344
Twenty-two bottles
of beer on the wall

555
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:53,679
Twenty-two bottles of beer

556
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:55,309
You take one down...

557
00:45:58,322 --> 00:46:01,382
This is the greatest!
Right, Herbert?

558
00:46:03,026 --> 00:46:04,118
Dags?

559
00:46:05,696 --> 00:46:08,665
I've been thinking about
our impending relationship,

560
00:46:08,732 --> 00:46:10,199
which I think is a good idea.

561
00:46:10,267 --> 00:46:13,134
And as long as you don't
talk too much,

562
00:46:13,203 --> 00:46:15,137
you let me call the shots,

563
00:46:15,205 --> 00:46:19,835
and my parents never,
never, never find out about you,

564
00:46:19,910 --> 00:46:22,743
I think it could
work out between us.

565
00:46:25,482 --> 00:46:27,814
Are you paying attention to me?

566
00:46:28,952 --> 00:46:31,079
- Twenty bottles of beer on the wall
- Stop it, Virus.

567
00:46:31,155 --> 00:46:32,554
Twenty bottles of beer

568
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:35,854
Dags<i>...</i>this is serious.

569
00:46:35,926 --> 00:46:39,453
Take one down, pass it around,
twenty bottles...

570
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:48,067
Spock! Shuttlecraft has encountered
strange alien matter.

571
00:46:48,138 --> 00:46:50,231
Have Chekov
scan computer bank.

572
00:46:51,441 --> 00:46:53,500
Wong...

573
00:46:53,577 --> 00:46:55,306
...proceed.

574
00:47:00,717 --> 00:47:02,844
Hey, Reg, man, gimme a beer.

575
00:47:03,387 --> 00:47:05,480
I'm gettin' cotton-mouth.

576
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:07,783
Reg?

577
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:09,982
Oh, man.

578
00:47:11,428 --> 00:47:15,455
Boy, you guys, man,
you sure don't know how to party, man.

579
00:47:16,233 --> 00:47:18,827
Boy, when I was your age...

580
00:47:18,902 --> 00:47:21,302
...well, we partied, man.

581
00:47:22,039 --> 00:47:23,870
Well...

582
00:47:23,941 --> 00:47:27,172
...talk about party,
might as well get one goin'.

583
00:47:55,973 --> 00:47:57,873
<i>Hey, you at the back of the bus.</i>

584
00:48:00,477 --> 00:48:02,638
<i>Tell your driver to pull over.</i>

585
00:48:14,124 --> 00:48:15,955
<i>Pull over now!</i>

586
00:48:40,550 --> 00:48:41,812
Shields up.

587
00:48:42,819 --> 00:48:44,377
Red alert.

588
00:48:49,626 --> 00:48:51,787
Oh, shit!

589
00:49:15,052 --> 00:49:16,952
Okay, okay, okay. Okay.

590
00:49:18,889 --> 00:49:22,484
Hey, Red, the party's over, man.
Chill out, dude.

591
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:26,393
Red, you're making us a little nervous.

592
00:49:26,463 --> 00:49:28,158
Do you think you could slow down?

593
00:49:28,832 --> 00:49:30,094
Red?

594
00:49:32,202 --> 00:49:34,670
Red's dead!

595
00:49:38,041 --> 00:49:39,838
We're gonna die!
We're gonna die!

596
00:49:41,979 --> 00:49:43,310
Great.

597
00:49:48,986 --> 00:49:50,112
Stop the bus!

598
00:49:50,187 --> 00:49:52,280
Too late.

599
00:49:52,356 --> 00:49:54,620
I'm gonna try
and jump the water.

600
00:49:54,691 --> 00:49:57,125
Stop the bus, you idiot!

601
00:49:57,194 --> 00:50:00,163
All right. Hold on, everybody.

602
00:50:13,610 --> 00:50:16,238
Steady as she goes.

603
00:50:33,096 --> 00:50:34,256
Wow.

604
00:50:36,566 --> 00:50:37,897
That's cool.

605
00:50:47,811 --> 00:50:50,837
Red ruled, man!
Don't cry, okay?

606
00:50:50,914 --> 00:50:52,245
Check it out.

607
00:50:52,315 --> 00:50:55,182
This is him in his prime
and stuff.

608
00:50:55,252 --> 00:50:57,516
Bye, guy. We'll see ya, okay?

609
00:50:58,355 --> 00:51:00,585
He's the Dope King, you know?

610
00:51:00,657 --> 00:51:04,991
See? The Dope King, man.
Long live the Dope King!

611
00:51:05,062 --> 00:51:07,895
It was bad. And he had the phaser.
He did.

612
00:51:08,532 --> 00:51:09,965
We're dredging the water now,

613
00:51:10,033 --> 00:51:12,763
but there's no sign
of your Star Trek man.

614
00:51:12,836 --> 00:51:15,771
We're gonna have to submit you
to a breathalyzer test, Mr. Woo.

615
00:51:17,274 --> 00:51:19,572
I told you not to pick him up,
asshole.

616
00:51:19,643 --> 00:51:23,079
Come on, come on.
Gather 'round.

617
00:51:29,519 --> 00:51:32,579
What are you people
trying to do to me?

618
00:51:34,157 --> 00:51:37,285
We're not even in Washington yet,
and we already have a...

619
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:39,225
...a fatality!
- Principal Moss?

620
00:51:39,296 --> 00:51:40,456
What?!

621
00:51:47,003 --> 00:51:49,437
Is there something
I can help you with, Officer?

622
00:51:49,506 --> 00:51:52,031
I'm gonna need
a number and an address

623
00:51:52,109 --> 00:51:54,873
- where I can get in contact with you.
- Yes.

624
00:51:57,614 --> 00:52:01,414
"Fairmount High School."
Must be quite a place.

625
00:52:02,352 --> 00:52:03,512
What?

626
00:52:07,824 --> 00:52:10,156
All right, everybody,
back on the bus!

627
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:13,092
- Go on!
- I'm driving!

628
00:52:17,367 --> 00:52:19,426
Lieutenant! Lieuten...

629
00:52:20,270 --> 00:52:23,000
Thank God! Klingon fools.

630
00:52:27,944 --> 00:52:31,880
This is all my fault.
Maybe we should cancel the trip.

631
00:52:31,948 --> 00:52:34,473
No. We're not canceling the trip.

632
00:52:34,551 --> 00:52:36,382
And no more talking!

633
00:52:36,453 --> 00:52:39,115
I'm not gonna have you people
making a fool out of me.

634
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:16,789
Now... stay here, don't touch,
and don't move.

635
00:53:19,796 --> 00:53:21,263
I'm outta here.

636
00:53:28,138 --> 00:53:31,301
Good afternoon. Welcome to
the Bradgate. How can I help you?

637
00:53:31,374 --> 00:53:34,309
Hello, there<i>...</i>Peggy.

638
00:53:34,377 --> 00:53:35,844
Hello.

639
00:53:35,912 --> 00:53:37,243
Todd Moss.

640
00:53:37,314 --> 00:53:40,215
Principal, Fairmount High.

641
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:46,621
I believe you have
some reservations for us.

642
00:53:48,325 --> 00:53:51,624
Fairmount High.
Let me check the computer.

643
00:53:54,297 --> 00:53:55,423
Fetch.

644
00:53:58,735 --> 00:54:01,397
We're here to meet the President.

645
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:03,900
I'll get you some stationery.

646
00:54:03,974 --> 00:54:06,534
- Over here!
- Where? Where?

647
00:54:06,610 --> 00:54:09,010
- Quit pushing me!
- Wrong way!

648
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:11,843
- Now look what you did!
- That's not my fault.

649
00:54:15,385 --> 00:54:17,410
Sorry, Principal Moss.

650
00:54:33,403 --> 00:54:34,427
Dude!

651
00:54:36,172 --> 00:54:37,571
Torture stuff.

652
00:54:38,975 --> 00:54:40,567
Check this room out.

653
00:54:41,244 --> 00:54:43,735
- Swing!
- I love it.

654
00:54:43,813 --> 00:54:46,407
Hey, do you have a screwdriver?

655
00:54:48,418 --> 00:54:49,976
This place is a dump.

656
00:54:50,053 --> 00:54:53,545
Now, Steve, this is
the only vacancy we could find.

657
00:54:53,623 --> 00:54:55,887
Let's try to make the best
of the situation.

658
00:54:55,959 --> 00:54:58,484
My parents are gonna
know about this.

659
00:55:00,263 --> 00:55:02,197
All right, students.

660
00:55:02,265 --> 00:55:04,825
Bus leaves in five minutes
for the Washington tour.

661
00:55:04,901 --> 00:55:07,631
- Do we have to go?
- Well, of course, silly.

662
00:55:07,704 --> 00:55:10,798
It's the best part of the trip.
See you in five.

663
00:55:13,543 --> 00:55:15,238
That chick needs to get laid.

664
00:55:15,312 --> 00:55:17,906
Yo, check this out.

665
00:55:22,652 --> 00:55:24,847
- That's disgusting.
- Can he see us?

666
00:55:24,921 --> 00:55:26,388
I don't think so.

667
00:55:33,063 --> 00:55:35,964
Over there is the Lincoln Memorial.

668
00:55:38,735 --> 00:55:41,135
Over there, students,
is the White House.

669
00:55:42,706 --> 00:55:45,197
And over there
was the Jefferson Memorial.

670
00:55:46,276 --> 00:55:47,903
This sucks.

671
00:55:48,778 --> 00:55:51,178
Can't we get off the bus
just for one picture?

672
00:55:51,247 --> 00:55:52,236
No!

673
00:55:52,949 --> 00:55:56,214
Please. We came all this way.

674
00:55:59,622 --> 00:56:02,648
Come on, come on,
gather 'round, gather 'round.

675
00:56:02,726 --> 00:56:05,194
- Let's get this over with.
- Well, now, students,

676
00:56:05,261 --> 00:56:08,788
J. Edgar Hoover was director of the FBI

677
00:56:08,865 --> 00:56:12,198
from 1924 until his death in 1972.

678
00:56:12,268 --> 00:56:14,031
He was a great American.

679
00:56:14,104 --> 00:56:17,870
He was a fascist transvestite,
and I hope he rots in hell.

680
00:56:19,142 --> 00:56:21,542
Hey, why can't we see
Kennedy's eternal flame?

681
00:56:21,611 --> 00:56:25,308
- You people don't deserve Kennedy.
- Who's Kennedy?

682
00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:28,442
Come on, hurry up,
we haven't got all day.

683
00:56:28,518 --> 00:56:29,678
Squeeze in.

684
00:56:30,553 --> 00:56:31,884
Come on, come on,

685
00:56:31,955 --> 00:56:34,651
let's look as though
we're having a <i>little</i> bit of fun.

686
00:56:35,225 --> 00:56:37,284
Come on,
turn those frowns upside-down.

687
00:56:37,827 --> 00:56:41,695
- Leave me alone.
- Okay, here we go.

688
00:56:41,765 --> 00:56:44,359
Virus, pull my finger.

689
00:56:45,101 --> 00:56:46,090
Come on.

690
00:56:46,169 --> 00:56:48,865
One, two...

691
00:56:48,938 --> 00:56:51,805
...three.
- Cheese!

692
00:56:55,912 --> 00:56:57,573
Dude.

693
00:56:57,647 --> 00:56:59,615
What stinks?

694
00:57:00,483 --> 00:57:01,745
Tour's over.

695
00:57:15,432 --> 00:57:19,562
What? I don't believe it.
They blew out Hoover's flame?

696
00:57:19,636 --> 00:57:23,163
My God, these kids are bigger
shitheads than I thought.

697
00:57:23,239 --> 00:57:25,833
<i>Senator, the students</i>
<i>from Fairmount High are here.</i>

698
00:57:25,909 --> 00:57:27,809
Send 'em in.
I'll talk to you later.

699
00:57:29,012 --> 00:57:34,006
Welcome to Washington.
How's the trip been so far?

700
00:57:34,083 --> 00:57:36,381
Wonderful. No problems at all.

701
00:57:36,453 --> 00:57:37,818
Good, good.

702
00:57:37,887 --> 00:57:40,219
So, tell me...

703
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:42,986
have you kids given any thought
to what you might say

704
00:57:43,059 --> 00:57:45,584
to the committee
about education reform?

705
00:57:45,662 --> 00:57:48,597
Yep. We're gonna tell 'em
that the education system sucks.

706
00:57:48,665 --> 00:57:51,498
- Sucks dick.
- That's not what they mean, sir.

707
00:57:51,568 --> 00:57:53,092
- Why not?
- Well...

708
00:57:53,169 --> 00:57:54,500
- I think it's great.
- I do, too.

709
00:57:54,571 --> 00:57:58,234
Now, remember, the President
invited you kids down to Washington

710
00:57:58,308 --> 00:58:00,970
because he wants you to
tell the nation

711
00:58:01,044 --> 00:58:03,069
how you really feel about school.

712
00:58:03,146 --> 00:58:07,344
So if you think the education system
sucks dick, then, by golly, you tell them.

713
00:58:07,417 --> 00:58:10,682
- Can I have your promise on that?
- I promise.

714
00:58:10,753 --> 00:58:12,721
Excellent, excellent.

715
00:58:13,790 --> 00:58:17,317
Excellent. You've done a good job
with these students, Principal Moss.

716
00:58:17,393 --> 00:58:19,293
I'll look forward to
seeing you all tomorrow.

717
00:58:19,362 --> 00:58:21,193
It's a great day for Americans.

718
00:58:22,232 --> 00:58:25,030
- Quickly, quickly, quickly. Come on.
- Let's get out of here.

719
00:58:25,101 --> 00:58:27,626
- Come on.
- Dick.

720
00:58:27,704 --> 00:58:29,262
I think he gets high.

721
00:58:52,061 --> 00:58:54,495
<i>Oh, God! Yes!</i>

722
00:58:54,564 --> 00:58:56,225
<i>Oh, deeper!</i>

723
00:58:57,967 --> 00:58:59,594
<i>Oh, Forrest!</i>

724
00:59:03,273 --> 00:59:04,262
Come in.

725
00:59:07,010 --> 00:59:10,377
I checked all the rooms.
Everyone is present and accounted for.

726
00:59:10,446 --> 00:59:12,471
Very good. Thank you, Miss Milford.

727
00:59:12,549 --> 00:59:15,484
Oh, my gosh... Lassie!

728
00:59:15,552 --> 00:59:18,020
I love Lassie!

729
00:59:18,555 --> 00:59:20,921
Lassie!

730
00:59:20,990 --> 00:59:23,117
Lassie!

731
00:59:23,893 --> 00:59:27,886
Do you mind if I watch?
All I get is pornos on my TV.

732
00:59:27,964 --> 00:59:29,864
Uh<i>...</i>

733
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,092
Okay.

734
00:59:54,424 --> 00:59:55,914
All right.

735
00:59:57,393 --> 00:59:58,724
You're on.

736
00:59:58,795 --> 01:00:01,320
Candygram for Miss Milford.

737
01:00:03,066 --> 01:00:04,499
Here we go, bro.

738
01:00:07,337 --> 01:00:08,736
Good job.

739
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:13,406
Miss Milford,
we've been looking for you.

740
01:00:13,476 --> 01:00:15,740
We wanted you to know
how cool it's been,

741
01:00:15,812 --> 01:00:18,872
you know, you showing us
around Washington and everything.

742
01:00:18,948 --> 01:00:20,575
Really?

743
01:00:20,650 --> 01:00:22,584
So we got you some candy.

744
01:00:23,286 --> 01:00:25,584
I don't know what to say.

745
01:00:25,655 --> 01:00:28,283
How did you know I like chocolate?

746
01:00:28,358 --> 01:00:30,053
'Cause it's all you ever eat.

747
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:34,652
- Well, we gotta go to bed. Bye.
- I'm so tired.

748
01:00:38,668 --> 01:00:41,865
I really think
they're starting to respect me.

749
01:00:50,279 --> 01:00:54,545
It was so nice of the children
to buy me their little gift.

750
01:00:56,853 --> 01:00:58,548
They're not so bad.

751
01:00:59,555 --> 01:01:02,820
They just... lack a little guidance.

752
01:01:18,408 --> 01:01:20,808
- Go, Milford!
- Nice!

753
01:01:21,844 --> 01:01:23,641
Very nice!

754
01:01:26,215 --> 01:01:27,341
Todd.

755
01:01:33,756 --> 01:01:35,815
Can I ask you a question?

756
01:01:40,363 --> 01:01:42,160
Are my breasts too small?

757
01:01:46,035 --> 01:01:48,526
I think they're...

758
01:01:50,406 --> 01:01:51,703
...perfect.

759
01:01:52,542 --> 01:01:55,033
Are you sure?

760
01:01:58,648 --> 01:01:59,876
Positive.

761
01:02:00,483 --> 01:02:02,417
Miss Milford, I don't think this is...

762
01:02:06,022 --> 01:02:07,489
Miss Milford!

763
01:02:13,796 --> 01:02:16,731
I hope Todd appreciates
what we've done for him.

764
01:02:16,799 --> 01:02:18,232
Let's rock!

765
01:02:18,301 --> 01:02:21,498
Now, wait just a minute. Have any of you
considered the consequences

766
01:02:21,571 --> 01:02:23,368
if Principal Moss finds out?

767
01:02:23,439 --> 01:02:27,034
Hey, let's go to that cool hotel.
The schedule said they're havin' a party.

768
01:02:27,110 --> 01:02:28,270
Yeah, good idea, Virus.

769
01:02:28,344 --> 01:02:30,369
Back! You leave me no choice.

770
01:02:30,446 --> 01:02:34,712
As student body president, I am
placing you all under citizen's arrest.

771
01:02:34,784 --> 01:02:38,117
You are all confined to your rooms
until I get Principal Moss.

772
01:02:38,755 --> 01:02:40,484
Miosky, take care of this guy.

773
01:02:41,758 --> 01:02:43,726
Lay a hand on me and I'll sue.

774
01:02:44,227 --> 01:02:45,353
Principal Moss!

775
01:03:04,247 --> 01:03:07,705
- Did you see that?
- It's shocking!

776
01:03:08,951 --> 01:03:10,816
Bartender!

777
01:03:10,887 --> 01:03:14,015
If I don't get laid tonight,
everyone's gonna think I'm a loser.

778
01:03:14,090 --> 01:03:16,183
By the way, have you
seen those Kennedy boys?

779
01:03:16,259 --> 01:03:18,090
I hear they're lots of fun.

780
01:03:18,928 --> 01:03:19,917
Yeah.

781
01:03:26,102 --> 01:03:27,899
Good one, Herbert!

782
01:03:31,107 --> 01:03:33,701
What... what is that girl doing?

783
01:03:37,380 --> 01:03:39,280
This party sucks, man.

784
01:03:39,348 --> 01:03:42,215
I thought Washington
was supposed to be cool, Reg.

785
01:03:44,420 --> 01:03:47,583
Hey, Reg, When you gonna get off
your ass and make a play on Wanda?

786
01:03:55,331 --> 01:03:57,060
Hi, sugar.

787
01:03:58,801 --> 01:04:02,032
Frank Hardin, CEO,
Bounty Burger Enterprises.

788
01:04:02,104 --> 01:04:03,662
Would you take your hands off me?

789
01:04:03,739 --> 01:04:07,937
Now, why don't you and me saunter up
to my room for a little party?

790
01:04:08,010 --> 01:04:10,478
Get away from me,
you geriatric lush.

791
01:04:10,546 --> 01:04:13,447
I'm not gonna let you go
till you take this key.

792
01:04:13,516 --> 01:04:15,484
I could pay you, if you'd like.

793
01:04:19,889 --> 01:04:23,120
- Hey, are you all right?
- I'm fine, thanks.

794
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:26,053
You want me to kick his ass?

795
01:04:28,297 --> 01:04:30,458
Get the group.
I'm throwing a party.

796
01:04:32,201 --> 01:04:33,293
Cool.

797
01:04:50,686 --> 01:04:53,553
Look, if you're on your knees
with a table cloth over your head,

798
01:04:53,623 --> 01:04:55,147
who's gonna notice?

799
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:05,299
Oops! Sorry.

800
01:07:24,373 --> 01:07:26,705
Did you ever wonder
if Jason has nightmares

801
01:07:26,776 --> 01:07:29,768
and if Freddy can
invade his nightmares?

802
01:07:32,081 --> 01:07:33,548
Yeah.

803
01:07:34,950 --> 01:07:37,214
I think about that all the time.

804
01:07:37,286 --> 01:07:38,878
You do?

805
01:07:40,389 --> 01:07:41,947
Me, too.

806
01:07:43,993 --> 01:07:47,224
Can, um, I try an experiment?

807
01:07:48,064 --> 01:07:49,861
Okay.

808
01:07:58,441 --> 01:08:00,841
You're, um... pretty.

809
01:08:01,911 --> 01:08:03,378
Really?

810
01:08:07,950 --> 01:08:09,042
Okay.

811
01:08:10,619 --> 01:08:13,417
<i>Hospital sources</i>
<i>have no explanation</i>

812
01:08:13,489 --> 01:08:16,049
<i>for the sudden disappearance</i>
<i>of the mysterious man</i>

813
01:08:16,125 --> 01:08:18,821

814
01:08:18,894 --> 01:08:21,988

815

816
01:08:26,268 --> 01:08:28,361

819
01:08:59,401 --> 01:09:00,629
Hey, Virus.

820
01:09:00,703 --> 01:09:03,831
Bet you never made moves
like this in your chess club.

821
01:09:04,773 --> 01:09:06,263
Wanna screw?

822
01:09:13,015 --> 01:09:14,642
Excuse me.

823
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:21,016
Yeah, it was great
for me, too.

824
01:09:42,378 --> 01:09:44,005
No, come on.

825
01:09:52,388 --> 01:09:53,912
Bonzai!

826
01:10:00,896 --> 01:10:03,421
Help! Somebody help me!

827
01:10:07,970 --> 01:10:10,564
I'm Miosky. I'm here to save you.

828
01:10:10,639 --> 01:10:11,867
What happened?

829
01:10:11,941 --> 01:10:15,377
Uh, I don't know.
Um, I'm comin' in, okay?

830
01:10:15,444 --> 01:10:18,743
- I'm scared.
- Don't be. It'll all be all right.

831
01:10:20,950 --> 01:10:22,679
What's your name?

832
01:10:23,953 --> 01:10:25,181
Du Mi.

833
01:10:33,829 --> 01:10:37,094
So... here we are.

834
01:10:38,167 --> 01:10:39,930
Just the two of us.

835
01:10:40,002 --> 01:10:42,232
First night in Washington.

836
01:10:42,771 --> 01:10:44,033
Yup.

837
01:10:45,074 --> 01:10:48,771
Listen, you were right about
all those things you said to me.

838
01:10:48,844 --> 01:10:50,505
What things?

839
01:10:50,579 --> 01:10:52,513
You know, about waking up

840
01:10:52,581 --> 01:10:54,606
and realizing I've wasted
my life studying.

841
01:10:55,484 --> 01:10:57,418
Studying sucks.

842
01:10:58,554 --> 01:11:00,249
I'm not gonna do it anymore.

843
01:11:00,322 --> 01:11:02,586
You're not gonna study anymore?

844
01:11:02,658 --> 01:11:05,650
No, I'm not gonna waste my life.

845
01:11:06,862 --> 01:11:08,159
Oh, cool.

846
01:11:10,599 --> 01:11:12,624
I need to ask you for a favor.

847
01:11:12,701 --> 01:11:14,692
Sure. What?

848
01:11:14,770 --> 01:11:17,204
Well, I've been thinking
about this, and...

849
01:11:17,273 --> 01:11:19,901
I've decided that I don't want
to go to college a virgin.

850
01:11:19,975 --> 01:11:20,964
Oh.

851
01:11:23,545 --> 01:11:24,807
Oh!

852
01:12:26,275 --> 01:12:28,607
Mission accomplished.

853
01:12:53,001 --> 01:12:54,434
One second.

854
01:12:55,704 --> 01:12:57,501
Excuse me, Miss Milford.

855
01:13:01,477 --> 01:13:04,139
Oh, my God, oh, my God,
what have I done?!

856
01:13:04,213 --> 01:13:05,805
What have <i>you</i> done?
What about me?!

857
01:13:05,881 --> 01:13:08,372
Two days on the job and I'm already
doing it with the boss!

858
01:13:08,450 --> 01:13:09,940
I'm such a whore!

859
01:13:10,452 --> 01:13:12,579
- Moss, are you in there?
- The senator.

860
01:13:12,654 --> 01:13:13,814
Moss!

861
01:13:14,990 --> 01:13:16,855
We're dead.

862
01:13:17,459 --> 01:13:19,086
Open the door, Moss.

863
01:13:19,161 --> 01:13:20,788
Just a second, sir.

864
01:13:22,564 --> 01:13:23,861
We're gonna be late if...

865
01:13:26,935 --> 01:13:29,927
We're due at the Capitol
and you're porking the math teacher?

866
01:13:30,839 --> 01:13:33,171
- Keyboarding teacher.
- Whatever.

867
01:13:33,242 --> 01:13:35,107
Don't just stand there.
Get your clothes on.

868
01:13:35,177 --> 01:13:38,442
- Let's get going. I'll wait outside.
- Yes, sir.

869
01:13:45,888 --> 01:13:47,947
Students, are you up yet?

870
01:13:48,757 --> 01:13:50,247
Open the door!

871
01:13:55,230 --> 01:13:56,322
Well?

872
01:13:56,398 --> 01:13:58,730
Don't worry, sir. I'll find them.

873
01:14:08,076 --> 01:14:10,408
I gave you one thing to do
and you screwed it up!

874
01:14:10,479 --> 01:14:13,676
Not to worry, sir, not to worry.
I'm sure they're around here somewhere.

875
01:14:13,749 --> 01:14:15,080
It's a pretty big city, jackass!

876
01:14:15,150 --> 01:14:17,812
- They could be anywhere!
- Oh, my God. I think I found them.

877
01:14:17,886 --> 01:14:19,717
Eat this!

878
01:14:31,934 --> 01:14:34,368
- What's that?
- Goat.

879
01:14:35,270 --> 01:14:39,104
- This is ridiculous.
- Um, I think they're this way, sir.

880
01:14:39,608 --> 01:14:40,973
- This way! This way!
- Wha...?

881
01:14:41,043 --> 01:14:43,375
It's all just a big set-up.

882
01:14:45,414 --> 01:14:46,972
Here they are, sir.

883
01:14:47,049 --> 01:14:49,779
Well, kids, as you can see,
we've all overslept.

884
01:14:49,852 --> 01:14:51,342
So let's get moving. Quickly. Quickly.

885
01:14:51,420 --> 01:14:53,820
No, we're not going anywhere
with Senator Bung-hole.

886
01:14:53,889 --> 01:14:55,948
Senator Bung-hole?

887
01:14:56,024 --> 01:14:58,185
D'Agastino, shut up
and let's get going.

888
01:14:59,495 --> 01:15:01,588
Not until you've heard the facts,
Principal Moss.

889
01:15:01,663 --> 01:15:04,632
It appears that Senator Lerman
has invited us to Washington

890
01:15:04,700 --> 01:15:06,998
for the sole purpose of
embarrassing the President

891
01:15:07,069 --> 01:15:09,401
in order to destroy his education bill.

892
01:15:09,471 --> 01:15:10,995
What?!

893
01:15:11,073 --> 01:15:13,837
Everything we need to prosecute
is in here.

894
01:15:14,643 --> 01:15:16,270
How did you get ahold of this?

895
01:15:16,345 --> 01:15:19,280
That, uh, information's
on a need-to-know basis.

896
01:15:19,348 --> 01:15:20,872
You're out of your league, boy.

897
01:15:20,949 --> 01:15:23,383
Senator Lerman,
I can't believe I'm hearing this.

898
01:15:23,452 --> 01:15:25,852
Oh, shut up, you little slut.

899
01:15:25,921 --> 01:15:28,014
Now, wait a minute, Senator.

900
01:15:31,260 --> 01:15:34,127
These kids may not be
the cream of the crop,

901
01:15:34,196 --> 01:15:37,222
but that doesn't give you the right
to walk all over them.

902
01:15:38,467 --> 01:15:42,301
And as for Miss Milford,
I think you owe her an apology.

903
01:15:42,371 --> 01:15:43,668
Why?

904
01:15:43,739 --> 01:15:46,037
I don't need you.
I don't need any of you.

905
01:15:46,108 --> 01:15:48,201
I'll find another way to pass my bill.

906
01:15:50,846 --> 01:15:53,440
And as for you, you pitiful excuse
for a principal,

907
01:15:53,515 --> 01:15:54,846
you're finished at Fairmount High.

908
01:15:54,917 --> 01:15:57,215
In fact, I'm gonna make sure you never
work in another school system again.

909
01:15:57,286 --> 01:15:58,776
Got it?

910
01:16:23,645 --> 01:16:26,842
Eighteen years of teaching
down the drain.

911
01:16:27,883 --> 01:16:29,350
What am I gonna do?

912
01:16:29,418 --> 01:16:33,548
Hey, don't worry, dude. We're gonna
put in a good word for ya. Huh, guys?

913
01:16:33,622 --> 01:16:35,852
- Sure.
- You got it.

914
01:16:35,924 --> 01:16:38,916
Hey, we got a serious problem
on our hands.

915
01:16:38,994 --> 01:16:41,963
- What's the matter?
- The senator's got Miosky.

916
01:16:48,170 --> 01:16:50,161
- Miosky!
- Miosky, don't go!

917
01:16:50,238 --> 01:16:51,762
What's the hurry?

918
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:54,274
- Miosky!
- Miosky! Miosky!

919
01:16:54,343 --> 01:16:57,642
- Don't go with him!
- Come here, man!

920
01:16:57,713 --> 01:16:59,840
- Stay here!
- Miosky!

921
01:17:01,316 --> 01:17:04,444
Come on now, son, we can't
keep the President waiting, can we?

922
01:17:04,519 --> 01:17:07,488
Miosky, don't get in the car!

923
01:17:10,225 --> 01:17:12,125
- Don't go!
- Christ!

924
01:17:13,962 --> 01:17:17,159
Well, this was an interesting field trip.

925
01:17:17,232 --> 01:17:19,132
- What are we gonna do?
- Go home.

926
01:17:19,201 --> 01:17:20,896
No! We can't let this happen.

927
01:17:20,969 --> 01:17:23,961
But if we go, we're only gonna
make the President look worse.

928
01:17:24,039 --> 01:17:25,768
Like Vietnam... no way to win.

929
01:17:25,841 --> 01:17:28,275
- What we need is a miracle.
- Yeah.

930
01:17:28,343 --> 01:17:31,244
Like the time the school got torched
right before finals.

931
01:17:32,447 --> 01:17:33,675
- That was us.
- That was us.

932
01:17:33,749 --> 01:17:35,842
- That was you?
- Yeah.

933
01:17:35,917 --> 01:17:37,646
Now, if we can stop finals,

934
01:17:37,719 --> 01:17:40,620
then we certainly can stop some
bung-hole senator. Right, AV Man?

935
01:17:40,689 --> 01:17:43,157
- Yeah, right, Dags.
- Let's get him.

936
01:17:43,225 --> 01:17:45,318
- Let's go!
- Yeah, let's go!

937
01:18:01,777 --> 01:18:03,210
Hey, Todd.

938
01:18:05,380 --> 01:18:06,870
Waitin' on you, man.

939
01:18:09,985 --> 01:18:13,477
You mean... you want me
to come with you guys

940
01:18:13,555 --> 01:18:17,719
after all the rotten things
I've done to you?

941
01:18:17,793 --> 01:18:19,488
You're one of us now.

942
01:18:19,561 --> 01:18:21,495
- Yeah.
- Yeah, come on.

943
01:18:25,901 --> 01:18:28,369
We don't have time for this.

944
01:18:29,871 --> 01:18:31,031
Sorry.

945
01:18:33,475 --> 01:18:34,840
I'm coming.

946
01:18:34,910 --> 01:18:37,242
- Yeah!
- All right!

947
01:18:55,397 --> 01:18:58,195
Oh, yes, you look just fine.

948
01:19:19,688 --> 01:19:21,656
- What are you doing?
- You drive too slow.

949
01:19:21,723 --> 01:19:23,281
But I wanna be the driver!

950
01:19:23,358 --> 01:19:25,656
You can be the timekeeper.

951
01:19:25,727 --> 01:19:28,787
- Let's rock 'n' roll.
- Yeah!

952
01:19:45,580 --> 01:19:47,070
Now, listen here.

953
01:19:47,149 --> 01:19:50,778
You just wait until they call for you.

954
01:19:52,387 --> 01:19:54,116
Make me proud, son.

955
01:20:09,571 --> 01:20:12,096
- Time?
- Two minutes till Miosky!

956
01:20:12,174 --> 01:20:13,607
Turn here. It's a shortcut.

957
01:20:19,981 --> 01:20:23,473
Spock, beam me up.
Spock, I'm ready now!

958
01:20:41,403 --> 01:20:42,631
About a week ago,

959
01:20:42,704 --> 01:20:45,537
I received a letter from
some very bright students,

960
01:20:45,607 --> 01:20:49,566
addressing their concerns
about education reform.

961
01:20:49,644 --> 01:20:53,705
As your president, I have always
taken it upon myself

962
01:20:53,782 --> 01:20:57,582
to reach out to the youth of America
and hear their voice.

963
01:20:57,652 --> 01:21:00,212
So, without any further ado,

964
01:21:00,288 --> 01:21:04,657
I present to you the future of America.

965
01:21:23,378 --> 01:21:24,970
Move it! Move it!
Move it! Move it!

966
01:21:25,046 --> 01:21:27,674
- Hurry up!
- Come on! Move! Move! Move!

967
01:21:33,521 --> 01:21:34,988
This way!

968
01:21:45,333 --> 01:21:48,325
Why don't we move on
to some Q & A?

969
01:21:48,837 --> 01:21:50,828
Uh, tell me, son...

970
01:21:50,906 --> 01:21:52,271
Son?

971
01:21:52,340 --> 01:21:54,274
Son?

972
01:21:55,443 --> 01:21:59,607
What do you see as the problems
afflicting our schools?

973
01:22:10,225 --> 01:22:11,385
What?

974
01:22:15,764 --> 01:22:16,753
Stop!

975
01:22:16,831 --> 01:22:19,732
That man is mentally challenged!

976
01:22:21,503 --> 01:22:23,869
- Who are you people?
- Mr. Chairman, this is outrageous!

977
01:22:23,939 --> 01:22:25,930
We're the students of Fairmount High.

978
01:22:26,007 --> 01:22:28,498
- Sorry we're late.
- What's going on here?

979
01:22:28,576 --> 01:22:31,170
Mr. Chairman, they're out of order!

980
01:22:31,246 --> 01:22:33,806
Aren't those the kids
from the party last night?

981
01:22:33,882 --> 01:22:35,543
- Yes, they are.
- Mr. Chairman, can we continue?

982
01:22:35,617 --> 01:22:37,278
We've already heard from
the representative from Fairmount.

983
01:22:37,352 --> 01:22:39,217
Let us speak!

984
01:22:39,287 --> 01:22:42,279
- Let us speak! Let us speak!
- They're out of order, Mr. Chairman!

985
01:22:42,357 --> 01:22:45,588
- Let us speak! Let us speak!
- Point of order! Point of order!

986
01:22:46,461 --> 01:22:48,793
- Order!
- Can we have them removed?

987
01:22:48,863 --> 01:22:50,228
Order!

988
01:22:52,901 --> 01:22:56,098
I'll give you just one minute.

989
01:23:02,711 --> 01:23:06,511
Uh, say something intelligent, okay?

990
01:23:07,582 --> 01:23:12,178
Mr. President, we came here to
inform you that you're the victim of deceit.

991
01:23:12,253 --> 01:23:15,689
Senator Lerman is using Miosky
to embarrass you

992
01:23:15,757 --> 01:23:17,452
in order to push through
his own education reform bill.

993
01:23:17,525 --> 01:23:19,516
That's an out-and-out lie!

994
01:23:19,594 --> 01:23:22,893
How dare you!
Mr. President, this is outrageous.

995
01:23:22,964 --> 01:23:26,798
By God, I was trying to protect you
from these juvenile delinquents.

996
01:23:26,868 --> 01:23:28,335
You're the delinquent!

997
01:23:28,403 --> 01:23:31,804
I've barred them from these proceeding
because I have reports, Mr. President,

998
01:23:31,873 --> 01:23:34,171
reports that they looted a Quickie Mart,

999
01:23:34,242 --> 01:23:36,540
- blew out Hoover's flame,
- No way, man.

1000
01:23:36,611 --> 01:23:39,011
and were responsible
for the death of their bus driver!

1001
01:23:40,115 --> 01:23:43,414
Look, maybe we are screw-ups...

1002
01:23:43,485 --> 01:23:47,854
I mean, we didn't even write the letter.
Lisa did, and she's an honor student.

1003
01:23:47,922 --> 01:23:50,584
Now, I haven't had the time
to read it yet,

1004
01:23:50,658 --> 01:23:53,218
but I bet what she wrote about
education reform was really smart.

1005
01:23:53,294 --> 01:23:57,424
Yeah. You government people need
to make sure that future generations

1006
01:23:57,499 --> 01:24:01,799
get a good education...
so they don't wind up like us.

1007
01:24:01,870 --> 01:24:04,703
We're soiled, but it's not too late
to save others.

1008
01:24:04,773 --> 01:24:06,365
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1009
01:24:06,441 --> 01:24:08,306
And, uh, one final thing.

1010
01:24:08,376 --> 01:24:11,470
We didn't kill Red.
He partied to death!

1011
01:24:11,546 --> 01:24:13,173
Yeah! Yeah!

1012
01:24:21,956 --> 01:24:27,121
Uh... come on, guys.
They're not buying it. Let's go.

1013
01:25:01,129 --> 01:25:03,120
Dag rules!

1014
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:09,229
Lerman, I want to see you
in my office this afternoon.

1015
01:25:09,304 --> 01:25:12,273
- Mr. President...
- Get out of my sight!

1016
01:25:20,348 --> 01:25:21,337
Hey.

1017
01:25:21,416 --> 01:25:24,613
Never underestimate Fairmount High.

1018
01:25:24,686 --> 01:25:25,914
Got it?

1019
01:25:25,987 --> 01:25:27,249
Whoo, Todd!

1020
01:25:27,322 --> 01:25:29,813
- See ya, wouldn't wanna be ya!
- Loser!

1021
01:25:29,891 --> 01:25:32,052
He is nothin' but a loser!

1022
01:25:32,994 --> 01:25:34,894
Wasn't this trip just great?

1023
01:25:34,963 --> 01:25:37,329
Get real... it was a nightmare!

1024
01:25:38,133 --> 01:25:41,159
Come on. Let's get back on the bus
before something goes wrong.

1025
01:25:43,171 --> 01:25:45,071
Hands are weary

1026
01:25:46,875 --> 01:25:49,241
Eyes stay closed

1027
01:25:50,712 --> 01:25:52,907
Women like these

1028
01:25:52,981 --> 01:25:54,744
Who break in

1029
01:25:58,286 --> 01:26:00,413
I wanna see you

1030
01:26:02,157 --> 01:26:04,625
Tomorrow the green grass

1031
01:26:06,094 --> 01:26:07,755
Oh, my love

1032
01:26:07,829 --> 01:26:11,731
Who stands by you when I call?

1033
01:26:15,436 --> 01:26:17,427
Once had a good home

1034
01:26:19,207 --> 01:26:21,471
Won't fall back on

1035
01:26:23,077 --> 01:26:26,843
Don't you think kindness
has an end?

1036
01:26:30,718 --> 01:26:32,743
I wanna see you

1037
01:26:34,355 --> 01:26:36,983
Tomorrow the green grass

1038
01:26:38,293 --> 01:26:40,056
Oh, my love

1039
01:26:40,128 --> 01:26:43,859
Who stands by you when I call?

1040
01:26:47,569 --> 01:26:51,232
Tomorrow the green grass,
tomorrow the green grass

1041
01:26:51,306 --> 01:26:54,798
Tomorrow the green grass,
yeah, yeah, yeah

1042
01:26:54,876 --> 01:26:58,642
Tomorrow the green grass,
tomorrow the green grass

1043
01:26:58,713 --> 01:27:01,807
Tomorrow the green grass,
the green grass

1044
01:27:16,965 --> 01:27:19,195
Starry maple

1045
01:27:20,835 --> 01:27:23,269
Signs stay closed

1046
01:27:24,706 --> 01:27:28,870
Back in my pocket's all you hear

1047
01:27:32,180 --> 01:27:34,375
I wanna see you

1048
01:27:35,850 --> 01:27:38,410
Tomorrow the green grass

1049
01:27:39,821 --> 01:27:41,686
Oh, my love

1050
01:27:41,756 --> 01:27:45,658
Who stands by you when I call?

1051
01:27:49,097 --> 01:27:52,794
Tomorrow the green grass,
tomorrow the green grass

1052
01:27:52,867 --> 01:27:56,325
Tomorrow the green grass,
yeah, yeah, yeah

1053
01:27:56,404 --> 01:28:00,067
Tomorrow the green grass,
tomorrow the green grass

1054
01:28:00,141 --> 01:28:02,939
Tomorrow the green grass,
the green grass

1055
01:28:18,393 --> 01:28:22,022
Tomorrow the green grass,
tomorrow the green grass

1056
01:28:22,096 --> 01:28:25,657
Tomorrow the green grass,
yeah, yeah, yeah

1057
01:28:25,733 --> 01:28:29,362
Tomorrow the green grass,
tomorrow the green grass

1058
01:28:29,437 --> 01:28:32,929
Tomorrow the green grass,
yeah, yeah, yeah

1059
01:28:33,007 --> 01:28:34,736
Yeah, yeah, yeah

1060
01:28:34,809 --> 01:28:36,504
Yeah, yeah, yeah

1061
01:28:36,577 --> 01:28:39,978
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
yeah, yeah, yeah

1062
01:28:40,048 --> 01:28:41,845
Yeah, yeah, yeah

1063
01:28:41,916 --> 01:28:43,645
Yeah, yeah, yeah

1064
01:28:43,718 --> 01:28:46,778
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah

1065
01:28:56,898 --> 01:28:59,833
Sunshine

1066
01:28:59,901 --> 01:29:01,664
Are you outside?

1067
01:29:01,736 --> 01:29:03,795
I am a simpleton by choice

1068
01:29:03,871 --> 01:29:06,169
Not speaking to hear my voice

1069
01:29:06,240 --> 01:29:08,868
Sunshine

1070
01:29:08,943 --> 01:29:10,877
Why are you sleeping?

1071
01:29:10,945 --> 01:29:15,211
Gotta get outside

1072
01:29:15,283 --> 01:29:17,513
Cover the ground on foot

1073
01:29:17,585 --> 01:29:19,849
Not hitching around your spur

1074
01:29:19,921 --> 01:29:22,321
Over the river
and through the woods

1075
01:29:22,390 --> 01:29:24,585
I've come this far
to bring in the goods

1076
01:29:24,659 --> 01:29:27,059
I get high even when I don't try

1077
01:29:27,128 --> 01:29:29,358
Let 'em pass by
with a wink to the eye

1078
01:29:29,430 --> 01:29:31,455
I reserve the right to be stoned

1079
01:29:31,532 --> 01:29:33,830
I reserve the right
to take it to collect them sums

1080
01:29:33,901 --> 01:29:35,232
I have the right

1081
01:29:35,303 --> 01:29:38,602
Don't try to be, there's really
no point in you biting me

1082
01:29:38,673 --> 01:29:42,200
I'm glad to see that it's easy
for me to be an MC

1083
01:29:42,276 --> 01:29:43,641
Let me tell you a little story

1084
01:29:43,711 --> 01:29:45,941
Like my dog Bobby hated the pool man

1085
01:29:46,013 --> 01:29:48,174
So I tried to play Kotter
and make things cool

1086
01:29:48,249 --> 01:29:50,479
And I said, Just let him smell you,
hold out your hand

1087
01:29:50,551 --> 01:29:53,520
He reached on out
and them - Bam! - he bit him

1088
01:29:53,588 --> 01:29:55,385
He bit him so fuckin' hard

1089
01:29:55,456 --> 01:29:57,549
Blood was steady gushin'
all over my back yard

1090
01:29:57,625 --> 01:29:59,889
I kept apologizin',
I felt so fuckin' bad

1091
01:29:59,961 --> 01:30:02,225
The dude was so cool,
he didn't even get mad

1092
01:30:02,296 --> 01:30:04,628
He said, Man, don't sweat it,
that's the dog's meaning

1093
01:30:04,699 --> 01:30:06,997
Took some Neosporin
and went back to his cleaning

1094
01:30:07,068 --> 01:30:09,229
Thought I had a dream
or else it was a movie

1095
01:30:09,303 --> 01:30:11,567
Your mind can have a joint,
easy like jungle boogie

1096
01:30:11,639 --> 01:30:13,834
$600 freebie and I got my job

1097
01:30:13,908 --> 01:30:16,172
Would you mind come,
but I gots the dog

1098
01:30:16,244 --> 01:30:18,644
Come, you can foam the water
with the bone

1099
01:30:18,713 --> 01:30:21,011
I wanna tell my mom,
ring her on the phone

1100
01:30:21,082 --> 01:30:23,414
Cherry Popsicle, icy cold freezing

1101
01:30:23,484 --> 01:30:25,714
Loves it on his gums
now that he is teething

1102
01:30:25,787 --> 01:30:27,982
Got a wee-wee pass,
lay then by the door

1103
01:30:28,055 --> 01:30:30,353
Nasty little shits,
he dropped them on the floor

1104
01:30:30,425 --> 01:30:33,087
Sunshine

1105
01:30:33,161 --> 01:30:34,992
Are you outside?

1106
01:30:35,062 --> 01:30:37,360
I am a simpleton by choice

1107
01:30:37,432 --> 01:30:39,764
Not speaking to hear my voice

1108
01:30:39,834 --> 01:30:42,394
Sunshine

1109
01:30:42,470 --> 01:30:44,404
Why are you sleeping?

1110
01:30:44,472 --> 01:30:49,171
Gotta get outside
