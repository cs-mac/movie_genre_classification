{979}{1018}{y:i}This is where it begins.
{1023}{1142}{y:i}Two atoms of hydrogen bond with|a single atom of oxygen to form H20,
{1147}{1194}{y:i}otherwise known as water.
{1199}{1287}{y:i}Then, if all goes well, the|temperature drops below freezing,
{1292}{1378}{y:i}the water crystallises|and a pretty brilliant thing happens.
{1632}{1733}{y:i}lf you ask me, the miracle isn't how|each snowflake is perfectly formed.
{1738}{1824}{y:i}The real winter miracle is|what can happen afterwards.
{1829}{1891}{y:i}lt's called a ''snow day''.
{1985}{2097}{y:i}lt's a day kids live for.|Schools close, roads disappear,
{2102}{2172}{y:i}grown men weep.
{2177}{2270}{y:i}My sister Natalie says|anything can happen on a snow day.
{2275}{2357}{y:i}This is the story|of one of those days.
{2362}{2471}{y:i}A day that changed the lives of me|and my family...forever.
{2884}{3007}ln Hawaiian that means,|"the hands tell a story".
{3012}{3098}And these hands are saying,|"happy sunny funtime" ,
{3103}{3261}as more warm weather wiggles its way|into our area. Back to you, Phyllis.
{3278}{3363}Hot weather, a hot body.|What more can you ask for?
{3368}{3405}Mahuuna aui!
{3422}{3533}Next a story of a man|who sued himself and won!
{3538}{3622}- "Mahuuna aui?"|- lt means kiss my butt.
{3627}{3697}- You were great.|- l'm a meteorologist, Tina.
{3701}{3756}Last time l checked,|meteorologists wore pants!
{3761}{3856}Last time l checked, we were number|three in a three station market.
{3861}{3931}Therefore, wear the skirt|or hit the bricks.
{3936}{4074}Tom, l know this is hard on your dignity,|but unless we beat Chad Symmonz...
{4078}{4150}..we're stuck.
{4184}{4276}{y:i}Climb aboard as we dip down|underneath the clouds
{4281}{4368}{y:i}for our exclusive Channel 1 0|3-D Dopeler radar.
{4373}{4431}lt's Doppler radar, you moron.
{4436}{4508}{y:i}From top to the bottom,|from the side to the side.
{4512}{4594}lf you wanna wear pants,|get Symmonz's ratings.
{4598}{4653}{y:i}Take a look at that.|Right here in Syracuse
{4658}{4763}{y:i}we're gonna be rockin' the old Casbah|with...woah...sixty degrees.
{4878}{4948}{y:i}We were in the middle of one of|those freakishly warm winters
{4953}{5035}{y:i}that are pretty popular among...|well, freaks.
{5039}{5076}Oh, yeah.
{5170}{5230}{y:i}Meet Principal Ken Weaver,
{5235}{5342}{y:i}the man who was number one|on every kid's winter hit parade.
{5417}{5565}Man-oh-man of La Mancha!|You hit Principal Weaver!
{5624}{5710}ls that the best you got? ls it?
{5729}{5807}Well, how about this?
{5832}{5904}{y:i}# Oh, there's no snow for you|Oh, there's no snow for you
{5908}{6002}{y:i}# Nothing but blue skies for me.|Are you going to school... #
{6017}{6130}Guy's getting way too cocky.|Look, he's rubbing our faces in it.
{6134}{6239}l'm an isosceles triangle!|Big target! Come on!
{6244}{6370}That clam dip's gotta learn that|winter's not over until we say it's over.
{6389}{6469}Quick, let's reload.|This man's asking for it.
{6473}{6601}That's it from last year's stash.|l guess we're out until it snows again.
{6606}{6661}{y:i}lf it snows.
{6731}{6782}lt'll snow.
{7076}{7162}{y:i}While my sister Natalie worried about|the fate of an entire season,
{7166}{7246}{y:i}l had my mind on|more important things.
{7344}{7439}{y:i}Her name was Claire Bonner.|Was l obsessed?
{7444}{7545}{y:i}Let's say l know the exact number|of times she blinks per minute.
{7673}{7716}lnteresting.
{7721}{7807}That dive told me that|she's looking for a new love in her life.
{7811}{7928}You know, someone bold, fresh...sexy.
{7932}{8028}Hal, Claire Bonner wouldn't spit on you|if your hair was on fire.
{8032}{8114}To people like her,|people like you are invisible.
{8119}{8172}So you guys think l'm invisible?
{8177}{8242}Then, l guess she won't see me|when l do this.
{8431}{8488}All right, so l'm invisible.
{8493}{8575}The day will come when Claire will see|what she's been missing.
{8672}{8789}{y:i}She saw what she was missing.|Me, Hal Brandston, Mr Smooth.
{9031}{9123}{y:i}My original idea was to stay|underwater until l died,
{9127}{9201}{y:i}but luckily the deep end|had other plans for me.
{9529}{9576}{y:i}lt was destiny.
{9686}{9778}Dude, give her the bracelet.|This is your big chance.
{9782}{9849}l'm just waiting for the right moment.
{9935}{10004}Hey, babe. Hop in,|everyone's waiting for us at the diner.
{10008}{10067}- Go away.|- Claire bear.
{10072}{10169}You don't return my calls.|You won't talk to me.
{10174}{10266}- l needed some time to think.|- What is there to think about?
{10271}{10355}You're Claire Bonner and l'm Chuck|Wheeler. America's dream team.
{10360}{10411}Not any more.
{10446}{10503}What are you looking at?!
{11099}{11181}You have defied the mighty Meltar|for the last time.
{11186}{11274}Prepare to taste|the flame of justice, Freon.
{11279}{11379}How many times must l tell you?|lt's Doctor Freon! Doctor!
{11383}{11455}- Natalie?|- Hey, Fangor.
{11459}{11547}You came just in time. Glad you're here!
{11551}{11654}What have l told you about|playing with these? They're collectibles.
{11659}{11760}lt would seem that your brother|is something of a Nimrod, is he not?
{11764}{11896}- That's enough from you, Mr Freon.|- That's Doctor Freon. Doctor.
{11900}{11966}Seriously,|hands off the merchandise, okay?
{11988}{12045}lf l'm gonna sell these,|l've got to keep them mint.
{12050}{12185}- Sell them? You can't split us up.|- Teams split up all the time. lt happens.
{12189}{12289}- Who will defend the universe?|- The universe will be just fine.
{12355}{12390}No, it won't .
{12482}{12589}- Dad, is it ever gonna snow?|- Aw...
{12593}{12679}l don't know, sweetheart.|lt's been tough lately.
{12683}{12769}- Last year it was El Niño, this year...|- El Sucko.
{12774}{12812}El Sucko, yeah.
{12844}{12920}Randall, is that the way|we eat soup in this house?
{13068}{13133}No, l'm sorry.|He wants to swim with the sharks,
{13137}{13237}he's gonna lose a little blood.|Yes, l know that's what...
{13308}{13353}l gotta go.
{13382}{13509}l know, l'm late again. l'm sorry.
{13513}{13591}- l'm a terrible mother, l know.|- Right again.
{13595}{13698}But l know that in your hearts|you'll find a way to forgive me.
{13764}{13821}And you are?
{13845}{13916}- Randy, call security!|- Yes, sir.
{13920}{13975}That's funny. Very funny.
{14005}{14141}- So, what did l miss?|- l can fit my fist in my mouth.
{14145}{14216}- Show Mum.|- Wow.
{14220}{14352}That's dandy, honey.|That's wonderful! That's cool.
{14623}{14684}This dollar is yours if you let it ring.
{14689}{14777}Please. Easiest buck|l ever made in my life.
{14782}{14832}Oh, brother.
{14985}{15079}- So, how was everybody's day?|- Good.
{15234}{15310}l'll be back in just a second! Talk to me.
{15366}{15437}l guess that phone call|must've been important.
{15796}{15904}{y:i}# l've been waiting|for a girl like you
{15933}{16005}{y:i}# To come into my life
{16025}{16139}{y:i}# l've been waiting|for a girl like you

{16216}{16273}What are you doing?
{16278}{16351}l didn't say you could come in my room.
{16355}{16420}Just get out of my room!
{16657}{16718}Hi, Nats. Anything out there?
{16723}{16817}l think so. lt's getting colder out.|The needle moved.
{16881}{17004}That it has. Maybe we've got|a little low pressure heading our way.
{17056}{17098}l'm going out.
{17102}{17190}- Good.|- Why good?
{17194}{17296}- He's been acting all weird lately.|- He has a lot on his mind.
{17323}{17393}You know, girls and...
{17442}{17488}Pretty much mostly girls.
{17527}{17654}- lt that why he has an ankle bracelet?|- Could be. Could be.
{17658}{17776}Boys Hal's age like to experiment...|Did you say ankle bracelet?
{17819}{17889}Well... lt's perfectly normal.
{17914}{17982}Oh, l forgot. l brought you something.
{17986}{18088}Mum gave me this when l started out|at the station. A good luck charm.
{18092}{18162}Maybe it'll work better for you.
{18205}{18276}Cool! Thanks.
{18329}{18408}Could you guys help me?|lt's stuck.
{18460}{18547}You get the head, l get the crowbar.
{18715}{18847}Don't tell me you don't see a pattern.|The bracelet, the break up...
{18875}{18933}The fact that we're both|big fans of whales.
{18937}{19009}- Whales?|- Yeah.
{19013}{19112}- Gentle giants. What's not to love?|- Exactly.
{19116}{19166}Hal, you're starting to scare me.
{19170}{19252}lf you wanna go out,|why don't you go with Patty Krone?
{19256}{19320}For some reason|she thinks you're cute.
{19430}{19549}l can't go out with a leg jiggler. Besides,|this thing with Claire is destiny.
{19553}{19615}- Are you catching any of this?|- Oh, yeah.
{19619}{19713}All right, you want proof?|Well, this is it.
{19860}{19918}{y:i}Okay, here we go.
{19955}{20071}{y:i}Breathe, breathe.|Easy, easy, nice and easy.
{20075}{20150}{y:i}Who's the man?|You're the man. Come on.
{20186}{20278}{y:i}Let's go. Keep it moving.
{20282}{20411}{y:i}Well, here l come, baby.|Large and in charge, and totally...
{20496}{20549}{y:i}..invisible.
{20839}{20892}l wish it was this easy.
{22030}{22088}What are you doing? Daydreaming?
{22092}{22203}- Just catching snowflakes.|- Did they taste good? lt's getting late.
{22207}{22335}Come on, scoot down.|Tomorrow is a school day.
{22339}{22433}- Don't rub it in.|- Love you. Sweet dreams.
{23209}{23289}You're on in two minutes, Mr Sunshine.
{23405}{23502}Oh... That's not supposed to be there.
{23727}{23791}That can't be right.
{23824}{23880}Can it?
{23884}{23944}Snow! And lots of it, folks.
{23948}{24046}This one almost caught us by surprise,|but we were right on top of it.
{24050}{24144}{y:i}A fast-moving little system|coming down from Canada,
{24148}{24234}{y:i}colliding with the warm flow|we've been experiencing...
{25469}{25527}Snow! !
{25899}{26007}{y:i}Last night's record snowfall|grinding the area to a halt...
{26114}{26187}{y:i}The following are closed for today:
{26191}{26292}{y:i}Titan Tool & Dye,|the Carousel Mall...
{26296}{26375}{y:i}..the Health Farm,|Fromlin's Corduroy Shop...
{26379}{26462}{y:i}..and finally,|the weekly poker game at my house.
{26466}{26528}{y:i}That concludes|the list of closings for today.
{26610}{26685}No, they can't do this to us.
{26704}{26775}{y:i}Oh, and, l forgot one.
{26823}{26909}{y:i}All schools are officially closed|for a snow day.
{27190}{27258}No school, no school, no school!
{27349}{27432}- Snow day...|- Snow day!
{27436}{27531}Snow day, snow day, snow day!|Anything can happen, Hal.
{27638}{27689}Oh, no...
{28169}{28233}{y:i}No matter how brave|you thought you were,
{28237}{28322}{y:i}just hearing his name could make|you wish you lived in Florida.
{28326}{28392}Snowploughman!
{28396}{28505}{y:i}To adults, he's just a creepy guy with|a plough named ''Darling Clementine'',
{28509}{28585}{y:i}but to us he's a snow day assassin.
{28607}{28687}{y:i}A man in serious need|of a good flossing.
{28802}{28852}{y:i}Legend has it his tyre chains
{28856}{28947}{y:i}are made from the braces of kids|who didn't get out of his way.
{28967}{29067}{y:i}They say the only thing he loves|is his bird, Trudy.
{29195}{29253}Run for your lives!
{29680}{29786}- l really don't like him.|- He's not a fun guy.
{29816}{29898}He's gotta be stopped.|What do you say, Hal?
{29902}{30054}This was gonna be the year. The prize,|the legendary "Second Snow Day".
{30058}{30162}Think of it, Hal. Two in a row.|We've never had two in a row before.
{30177}{30231}Sorry, but there's something l gotta do.
{30257}{30358}- Claire Bonner. Who's she?|- Just this girl. You don't know her.
{30362}{30457}Wait a second. You're gonna waste|a snow day on some girl?
{30461}{30532}Look. Tomorrow everything|goes back to normal,
{30536}{30670}and l'll be one of a million guys wishing|Claire Bonner was their girlfriend.
{30674}{30729}But today, maybe l can change that.
{30733}{30792}- But we're a team.|- And we always will be.
{30796}{30928}- But l gotta go solo today, all right?|- That's okay. l don't need you anyway.
{31020}{31107}- There's no way l can stay home.|- lt's not about giving you a break.
{31111}{31212}Okay, that's a good idea.|We'll leave Randy here by himself.
{31461}{31552}Briefcase, check.|Commuter mug, check.
{31556}{31626}Lucky Troll doll, check.
{31653}{31773}Look out, Asian carbonated beverage|market. Here comes trouble.
{32283}{32341}Don't worry, Mum.|There'll be other work days.
{32345}{32453}{y:i}Mum may have lost a chance|to swim with the sharks,
{32457}{32532}{y:i}but at least|she gained a little quality time.
{32536}{32626}Okay, clean Mummy's clothes. Okay.
{32823}{32941}{y:i}As for me...l stood on the threshold|of a brave new world.
{33307}{33407}Winter Wonderland, my butt...
{33430}{33551}- Hey, beautiful day, isn't it?|- Give me a break!
{33555}{33655}"Neither rain nor sleet nor..."|What's the last one, Mr Hebert?
{33690}{33750}Everybody makes fun of the mailman.
{34198}{34255}Oh, great. That's just great.
{34275}{34383}Well, at least|l can see the outline of my car.
{34387}{34441}My own little blue car.
{34467}{34592}Today is really, really...shaping up.
{35116}{35167}lf you kids think...
{35208}{35258}..because l'm not...
{35296}{35414}You kids wanna play rough?|l invented rough!
{35558}{35679}Must muster the courage of|1 0 principals. Must get home.
{35832}{35881}Now!
{36011}{36080}No, no, no!
{36371}{36445}- You've got the reflexes of a dead cow.|- Oh, yeah?
{36449}{36572}lt would seem that it is l who has|the oxygen depriving sleeper hold.
{36643}{36756}l wonder if in Hawaii instead of|snow days they have lava days.
{36760}{36853}- ln LA they get off on bad hair days.|- l heard that, too.
{36890}{36940}Hey, you know...
{36944}{37077}The problem is, you can never|make a perfect snow angel.
{37081}{37166}There's always gonna be|that handprint when you climb out.
{37179}{37228}Come here.
{37292}{37363}- Not always.|- lt's perfect.
{37380}{37429}lt sure is.
{37451}{37494}Come on.
{37554}{37670}You know what we can do today?|Start an avalanche.
{37674}{37766}- l've got a bracelet to return.|- No, no.
{37770}{37874}Lane, this snow day has given me|a second chance with Claire.
{37878}{38017}What do you think she's gonna do? Hug|you, lick your ear and call you "Bunky" ?
{38021}{38096}Maybe you don't believe in|true love, but l do.
{38100}{38198}ls that what you think it is?|Man, you're dumb!
{38202}{38297}Love isn't about fate|and magic bracelets and destiny.
{38301}{38444}lt's about finding someone you|can stand to be around for 1 0 minutes.
{38448}{38556}- You're a real romantic.|- This is gonna end in flames.
{38560}{38663}Come on, Lane, have a little faith.|lt is a snow day.
{39231}{39281}What do you think you're doing?
{39285}{39401}Chet's trying to break his all-time|record. Oh, man. You blew it!
{39405}{39478}- l told you to lay down the rug.|- We will.
{39482}{39563}l thought|this was supposed to be a day off.
{39567}{39675}Wayne, l'd be careful about|eating too much of that stuff.
{39679}{39816}With all those layers, if you had to go|to the bathroom, it could be close.
{39874}{40010}All right, you brought Meltar!|Where's his faithful sidekick Fangor?
{40014}{40109}Chasing some girl. Don't even ask.
{40113}{40186}So, what's our quest today?
{40190}{40300}You know what Meltar says,|"Listen to the wind!"
{40430}{40502}That's not the wind!
{40959}{41022}Snowploughman.
{41208}{41262}Come on! Move it!
{41331}{41449}l don't know about this.|Couldn't we just make a snowman?
{41453}{41530}No way. This is the year|Hal and l said we'd take him down.
{41534}{41645}- Hal's not here so...|- Snowball. Now.
{41649}{41731}What do you need? Standard|"Slushball" , always dependable.
{41735}{41851}The ever-popular "Moonball". The last|thing he sees is you mooning him.
{41855}{41916}l've got the jelly-filled "Snownut".
{41943}{42033}And this one...speaks for itself.

{44553}{44608}Come on, guys! Help!
{44685}{44739}Come on, Chet, go!
{44939}{45009}Oh, man! Oh, man! Oh, man!
{45605}{45722}{y:i}The office is closed down,|and you make me come to work.
{45726}{45849}{y:i}l had to walk the whole way!|Look at my toes.
{45853}{45971}{y:i}- They're frozen, like ''Tater-Tots''.|- Nona, what was l supposed to do?
{45975}{46029}l'm completely snowed-in here.
{46033}{46093}{y:i}Everybody else is taking the day off.|Why can't we?
{46097}{46153}We have worked too hard and too long
{46157}{46283}to let a little snow get in the way of 42|percent global market share. lt'll be fun!
{46287}{46360}First thing l need|is the quarterly earnings report.
{46384}{46476}{y:i}The first thing you need|is a stun gun for your kid.
{46554}{46598}l'll call you back.
{46628}{46742}Randy honey, is that any way|to treat your head?
{46746}{46842}l wanna go outside. Mrs Huffner|lets us go outside at school.
{46846}{46962}But remember what Mummy said?|When her work is done, we go outside.
{47222}{47275}Tell me a story.
{47338}{47406}Okay, okay.
{47444}{47591}Once upon a time, in a land far,|far away there lived a little prince...

{47916}{47960}Hee-haw! Hee-Haw!
{47963}{48047}Mrs Huffner brings in a real donkey.

{48293}{48358}Yeah, yeah!

{48712}{48805}- Hey, Principal Weaver.|- Hey, kids.

{49160}{49244}l know what Chuck is gonna say.|"Prepare to die, waste case."
{49248}{49359}Chuck? He had his chance.|Today, she's all mine.

{50149}{50260}- Bill, what are you doing here?|- Word gets around, dude.
{50264}{50351}You're not the only guy|who knew they broke up.
{50355}{50450}Some of these guys|came all the way from Rochester.
{50484}{50595}You gotta be kidding me!|Beat it, dips! Got that, Korn?
{50613}{50761}Disappear before you get free passes|to the Chuck Wheeler House of Pain!

{51234}{51347}{y:i}We'll be right back|with a live Channel Six weather...
{51351}{51451}Cheer up. At least she watches|your dad's station.
{51528}{51576}Yes, she does.
{51580}{51634}Just give me one little minute.
{51738}{51791}All right, but only a minute.
{51882}{51977}You wanted to wear pants,|you're wearing pants.
{51981}{52114}Tina, people don't want this "Frosty|the Weatherman" stuff. They don't .
{52118}{52195}They want real weather from the only|guy who knows what he's doing.
{52199}{52317}They want someone who can|juggle fire and make cool noises.
{52321}{52402}You're wrong. People will find out|who predicted the storm first,
{52406}{52482}and when they do,|watch out, Chad Symmonz.
{52486}{52615}Claire bear! What happened|yesterday was...yesterday.
{52644}{52730}Today is today.|A day to go skating.
{52821}{52913}{y:i}- What do you say?|- We broke up!
{52917}{53011}{y:i}- Yes, but not technically. Let's talk.|- Yes. Technically.
{53015}{53063}{y:i} Let it snow, let it snow.
{53067}{53186}{y:i}That's what kids of central New York|are saying as last night's snowfall...
{53190}{53252}Oh, honey...
{53256}{53381}l'm here at Slupperton Hill, or|as the kids like to call it, "Suicide Hill".
{53385}{53544}{y:i}And what better way to say, ''Yeah,|winter!'' than with a toboggan ride?
{53554}{53587}Hey, Dad!
{53591}{53730}l'm gonna ask my friends to give me|just a little push. l said a little one!
{54579}{54675}What is this? Frank, pan off him.|Pan off him, Frank!
{54679}{54746}Do something. Do something!
{54769}{54824}{y:i}Claire, l know you're watching.
{54828}{54904}{y:i}My name is Hal.|You don't know me but l know you.
{54908}{54986}l know that your favourite gum|is " watermelon Bubblicious".
{54990}{55052}{y:i}And that you can't go|a whole day without diving,
{55056}{55149}{y:i}and that you have the most amazing|brown eyes l've ever seen.
{55153}{55245}{y:i}l also know that yesterday|''America's Dream Team'' broke up.
{55249}{55310}Personally, l think it was the right move.
{55314}{55476}So, today, if you're wondering|what to do next, try something new. Me.
{55480}{55547}lt's a snow day, Claire.|Anything can happen.
{55796}{55897}Hal, when l was your age, l used to|wear cologne to get a girl to notice me.
{55901}{56036}l'm sorry, Dad, but it's just that this girl|is just...so, you know, she's just...
{56040}{56174}l know what you mean. Get your blood|running, huh? Do what you have to do.
{56178}{56289}Don't worry. We meteorologists|are trained for the unpredictable.
{56293}{56380}You might wanna look at this.|We taped the Channel 1 0 feed and...
{56384}{56496}{y:i}Who was there first|when the blizzard of the century came?
{56500}{56542}{y:i}Why, Chad Symmonz, of course.
{56546}{56659}{y:i}Whenever there's weather|that affects our area, l'll be there first.

{57331}{57444}- lt was kinda like that.|- l know what l'm doing, okay?
{57472}{57561}Then enlighten me.|How does that work into your plans?
{57611}{57693}What'd you expect?|They always get back together.
{57740}{57808}{y:i}# There she goes
{57839}{58010}{y:i}# There she goes again|Racing through my brain
{58026}{58103}{y:i}# And l just can't contain
{58123}{58211}{y:i}# This feeling that remains
{58273}{58382}{y:i}# There she goes|There she goes again... #
{58609}{58722}Why do l have to be the decoy?|l'm the one who got the ketchup.
{58726}{58777}lf you don't play dead,|you're gonna be dead.
{58781}{58866}- That's comforting.|- Here he comes.
{58909}{59006}Next time|you can get your own ketchup!
{59022}{59087}This better not stain my coat.
{59091}{59232}{y:i}# Oh, my darling Clementine...#

{61507}{61559}A little dab'll do ya.

{63037}{63093}Trudy!
{63958}{64115}{y:i}Of course, that was Love Letters|by the sultan of smooth, Mr Al Martino.
{64119}{64201}{y:i}While we're still in a romantic mood,|skaters are reminded
{64205}{64274}{y:i}that there's no better way|to say ''l love you''
{64278}{64411}than with a brand new pair of skate|guards. On sale in the main office.
{64415}{64491}Come on. lf you won't do it for me,|do it for them.
{64495}{64577}How many years has he been putting|everybody to sleep with that music?

{65403}{65465}- Who am l?|- You're my woman.

{66172}{66254}- What's the problem?|- Oh, my gosh. ln the ladies' room.
{66258}{66339}- l tried to stop her. l really did.|- Stop who from doing what?
{66361}{66458}" Al Martino bites the big one."|That's what she wrote.
{66462}{66588}ln the bathroom stall. Some weird girl|with a dog collar and a snake tattoo.
{66592}{66642}What kind of sicko!
{66646}{66701}Take me to her now!
{66967}{67068}What are those things that|have bright red butts? Baboons!
{67072}{67197}- Chuck, what colour are my eyes?|- They're green, of course.
{67220}{67329}A darkish shade of green,|looks like brown. l'm on top of it.
{67333}{67441}One last question.|What flavour gum do l chew?
{67568}{67692}- What kind of a bogus question is that?|- Kid on TV knew.
{67696}{67754}- What kid on TV?|- Him.
{67758}{67796}May l have your attention?
{67800}{67916}{y:i}Due to circumstances, Mr Zellweger|cannot be with us right now.
{67920}{68006}So...to continue in the party mood...
{68010}{68119}..l'd like to make a special|snow day dedication to Claire Bonner.
{68197}{68307}Hi. You might think l'm crazy, Claire.|That's okay.
{68641}{68718}You are so dead.
{68737}{68818}What? l can't hear you.

{69643}{69748}Snowploughman,|l mean, Mr Snowploughman,
{69752}{69906}l was wondering. That story about how|you frequently grind kids into road salt...
{69910}{69977}lt's just a story, right?

{71212}{71288}- Oh...|- Your little Natalie is next in line.
{71292}{71391}Great. You must be the guy|the kids call "Snowploughman".
{71421}{71550}The kids have a lot of different names|for me but you can call me Roger.
{71596}{71641}Okay, Roger.
{71663}{71728}Oh, is that Wayne Alworth?|Hi, honey!
{71732}{71876}- Mrs Brandston!|- Yeah, that's actually Wayne.
{71880}{71951}He's just finishing his plough ride.
{71997}{72116}- The kids really love to toot the horn.|- What's he writing?
{72181}{72268}Pleh? Pleh...
{72272}{72405}That's actually a kind of...|Well, it's a technical term.
{72409}{72578}Just a ploughing term. Ma'am,|there's a lot of kids on this list, so...
{72582}{72654}- ..if l could find your daughter...|- Sorry. Sure...
{72749}{72892}Randy, sweetheart! What are you...|l got him a paint set for his birthday...
{72896}{72975}Honey, you'll freeze to death.|Come back!
{73478}{73512}Hello?
{73516}{73626}Snowploughman, there's someone|here who wants to say hi to you.
{73678}{73833}Trudy! Are you okay, baby? They|haven't hurt you yet, have they, honey?
{73837}{73920}- Not yet.|- What do you want from me?
{73924}{74020}We get our friend back|and you give us a second snow day.
{74047}{74174}- No way.|- Then we keep the bird, you keep him.
{74355}{74392}What do you want me to do?
{74543}{74595}Bill?
{74599}{74678}Check it out. French fry log cabin.
{74682}{74773}- You're not wasting your day.|- l know it.
{74777}{74868}- What's going on? Where's Hal?|- Football field.
{74885}{74989}{y:i}He's off building|some kind of shrine to Lady Claire.
{74993}{75087}And l'm the feeb|who's been sent here to fetch her.
{75201}{75275}And to think|we used to be afraid of this joker.
{75280}{75456}How easy is this? We give him his bird,|and he gives us an extra snow day.
{75461}{75526}l say we go for two...no, three!
{75530}{75625}Three snow days|and l get to drive his truck!
{75795}{75909}Where's this mook, anyway?|He should be here by now.
{76333}{76427}Help! Help!
{76846}{76941}What if l might actually think|this guy is cute?
{76946}{77067}What if you might be on the verge of|committing total social suicide?
{77072}{77134}Help me, please, l beg you!
{77253}{77371}Anyway, let's pretend you like this guy.|What do you know about him?
{77376}{77461}He's really ticklish, l can tell you that.|What else?
{77466}{77607}He hates drum machines. And he once|gave mouth to mouth to a baby chick.
{77612}{77740}lt was Easter. My mum got the bright|idea of bringing chicks for everyone.
{77744}{77881}lt was kinda cute till they started dying,|which they did after we named them.
{77886}{78038}So there's Hal on his hands and knees|giving mouth to mouth to my bird!
{78043}{78134}lt was...it was...

{78864}{78943}l know you hardly even know the guy.
{78968}{79007}But...
{79061}{79144}You know when you're making|a snow angel and...
{79149}{79228}..you wanna make it perfect|but you can't because...
{79233}{79349}..there's always that handprint|you make when you climb out?
{79354}{79432}Well, with Hal there's no handprint.
{79638}{79710}Claire! What's Chuck gonna think?
{79734}{79798}Chuck doesn't think.
{79911}{79973}- The Wayne!|- The bird!

{81503}{81573}You should see what he can do|when he's really trying.
{81831}{81922}You made this for me? Why?
{81927}{82012}lt's your favourite animal. The whale!
{82084}{82178}You know? Nature's gentle giant.
{82183}{82271}But...l like zebras.
{82346}{82405}Then how come you have|a whale charm on your bracelet?
{82410}{82482}You have my bracelet?
{82487}{82611}- Why does he have my bracelet?|- Destiny. Pure destiny.
{82727}{82789}Oh, no...
{82933}{83025}Hey, zip, you're in luck.|The House of Pain now delivers.
{83030}{83084}Chuck! What do you want?
{83089}{83173}Claire bear!|l've been looking all over for you!
{83177}{83238}As for you, Mr Wonderful...

{83934}{84016}The guide kept telling us|to gaze at the wonders of the deep.
{84035}{84094}All l did was look at you.
{84099}{84193}Why did you buy me a whale?|l've always wanted to know.
{84198}{84316}Because of "Shampoo" , the killer whale.|You love that whale.
{84321}{84411}lt's not "Shampoo" , you blowhole!|lt's "Shamu".
{84416}{84459}Don't even think about it!
{85049}{85138}Quite a ladies' man, aren't you?|Craig will be hurting you today.
{85143}{85196}Hi, there!

{93360}{93454}What do you want me to say?|l lost, evil won, the end.
{93458}{93517}{y:i}''l lost, evil won, boo-hoo-hoo. ''
{93521}{93640}{y:i}You think l ate a sandwich the day|on Andromeda when l got ambushed?
{93645}{93702}{y:i}- l guess not.|- Do you know why?
{93706}{93827}{y:i}- Because you're lactose intolerant?|- Quiet! Can't you see l'm talking?
{93832}{93972}{y:i}There on Andromeda, things|looked bleak. l, too, had lost a partner.
{93976}{94118}{y:i}Fangor had abandoned me and there|l was, up poop river without a paddle.
{94122}{94171}{y:i}- And?|- Stranded there alone,
{94175}{94296}{y:i}with the fate of the universe hanging|in the balance, l remembered a saying.
{94300}{94396}Yeah, yeah. "Winners never quit,|and quitters never win."
{94400}{94466}{y:i}What? No!
{94470}{94545}{y:i}Quitters will be cast|into the flaming pit of death!
{94549}{94600}{y:i}Uh, that's gotta sting.
{94605}{94671}{y:i}lt's up to you, Natalie.|Gather your forces.
{94675}{94760}{y:i}Only you can unleash|the rage of a hundred snow days
{94764}{94896}{y:i}that could've been,|that should've been...if not for him.
{94922}{95006}Snowploughman.
{95420}{95531}- Oh, man. l thought you were Chuck.|- lt's me.
{95559}{95600}Yeah.
{95674}{95795}- So, you escaped the House of Pain.|- Oh, yeah, it was no big deal.
{95827}{95928}You should've seen me.|lt was unbelievable.
{96039}{96167}- Tough break back there with Claire.|- Nothing l can't handle.
{96171}{96255}Come on, Hal! Let me bring you back.
{96271}{96361}- "But l like zebras."|- A minor setback.
{96365}{96483}- What is your problem?|- l found that bracelet for a reason.
{96487}{96577}l don't wanna hear another word|about that crappy bracelet.
{96581}{96646}lt's not crappy.
{96718}{96760}What?
{96764}{96840}- Forget it. lt doesn't matter.|- Yes, it does.
{96868}{96925}Just leave me alone.
{96997}{97058}l can't believe l wasted|a whole snow day on this.
{97062}{97156}What mind-blowing thing|didn't you get to do today?
{97161}{97245}- You don't wanna know.|- Yes, Lane, l do.
{97249}{97286}This.
{97554}{97640}You said anything can happen.
{97702}{97758}Surprise.
{98348}{98450}Thank you, Sally and Ken.|We're here on West Burlington Street,
{98454}{98542}or should l say,|West Buuuurlington Street,
{98546}{98689}where this record-breaking snowfall|hasn't kept my fans from coming on out.
{98693}{98806}- Let's move. He was here first.|- We're not going anywhere.
{98810}{98890}- What do you think of all this snow?|- lt's great!
{98894}{99060}Kinda caught you by surprise, didn't it?|Caught a lot of people by surprise,
{99064}{99208}but ol' Chad was in the right place|at the right time, once again!
{99212}{99331}l'd expect nothing else from|the area's number one meteorologist.
{99335}{99399}Well, thank you. Hey...
{99403}{99535}Channel Six's Tom Brandston,|or should l say, Old Man Weather?
{99601}{99634}Tom...
{99638}{99750}That storm really fooled me last night.|How did you call it? l'd like to know.
{99754}{99830}- Just call it a hunch, Tom.|- A hunch?
{99834}{99962}- Yeah. The cold front...|- Can't learn it in a weatherman school.
{99966}{100018}l'm just kidding with you there.
{100022}{100144}l'm sure you learned that the upper|atmospheric shift that we had last night
{100148}{100213}led to the sudden two point drop|in the Fleeber lndex.
{100217}{100343}- Of course, Tom. Anyhow...|- There is no Fleeber lndex, Chad.
{100389}{100522}- You're a fraud.|- Well, you're a joke, Tom. A joke.
{100526}{100602}l'll tell you what.|To prove you're not a fraud,
{100606}{100768}why don't you tell everybody here...|Tell us where this comes from.
{100787}{100848}Yeah, Chad. Tell us.
{100852}{100931}- What, snow?|- Snow.
{100961}{101047}Snow. Come on. Well...
{101051}{101111}You know, the...
{101115}{101254}The Eskimos have exactly|eleven words for snow.
{101258}{101354}We, on the other hand, we only|have one word and that word is...
{101378}{101411}..snow.
{101415}{101487}When the barometric pressure
{101491}{101605}reaches all that cold, cold wind|that comes from ol' Canada,
{101609}{101768}it goes through a process that Tom|knows well is classified information,
{101772}{101871}and it forms what|we meteorologists like to call...
{101875}{101934}..the white stuff.
{101947}{102021}- You're a loser!|- Yeah!
{102054}{102172}- Could you get in your van and go?|- Sure, l'll go.
{102176}{102250}As soon as you tell everybody|who really was there
{102254}{102341}when the blizzard of the century|came knocking at our door, Chad.
{102345}{102423}- Who was it, Chad?|- Yeah, Chad?
{102427}{102521}- Tom Brandston.|- Sorry, l couldn't hear that one.
{102525}{102570}Tom Brandston.
{102608}{102692}Tom...Brandston.
{102771}{102827}Tom Brandston.
{102831}{102896}Tom Brandston.
{103553}{103671}- How did you know l'd be here?|- You couldn't go a day without diving.
{103711}{103767}You wanna come up?
{103938}{104066}So, this is the high dive.|Sure is...high.
{104260}{104381}So, anything|can happen on a snow day.
{104385}{104470}That's what you said to me|on TV this morning.
{104474}{104559}ls this the anything you had in mind?
{104746}{104786}No.
{104816}{104874}l mean, yes.
{104908}{105012}Believe me, this is more than anything|l could've hoped for.
{105054}{105149}lt's just not the anything|that's supposed to happen.
{105205}{105286}Man, how could l have been so stupid?
{105290}{105426}- No, not about you, about Lane.|- Lane.
{105445}{105519}l can't believe what|l put her through today.
{105523}{105621}- And when she kissed me...|- She kissed you?
{105625}{105724}- What did you do?|- l came here.
{105728}{105850}Oh, boy. Well, l guess you know|what you have to do.
{105946}{106057}{y:i}While my mission had just begun,|Snowploughman's was nearly over.
{106061}{106179}{y:i}Before him lay his last victim,|the final unploughed street.
{106227}{106304}Oh, yeah. Oooh...
{106327}{106467}Trudy, why don't you take it from here?|Atta girl. Here we go, baby.
{106587}{106650}You got it, girl! Yeah.
{107145}{107283}All right, Trudy, don't you worry.|Nobody's gonna hurt you this time.
{107390}{107456}Well, look who's here!
{107460}{107575}lf you're looking for a ride, l'm afraid|you'll have to wait till next year.
{107638}{107704}- Now, get out of my way!|- No!
{107708}{107825}No? No, huh? Okay, all right.
{107829}{107944}l hope that's " no" as in,|"Oh, no, please, Mr Snowploughman.
{107948}{108038}"Please don't roll over me|like a human speed bump."
{108094}{108189}"No" as in, "You've stolen|your last snow day from us!"
{108193}{108298}"Us" ? l don't see any " us" here.
{108302}{108450}All l see is a whiny little runt who's going|back to school tomorrow. Too bad.
{108503}{108612}Oooh... Now l'm scared! Oohh!
{108662}{108779}You will be! Listen to the wind!
{109049}{109113}That's not the wind.
{109815}{109929}Snow day! Snow day! Snow day!
{110270}{110333}Charge!
{111400}{111481}l'm sorry. lt's just so funny!
{111485}{111578}You dimwits actually think|you clobbered me!
{111657}{111752}But the truth is, l've already won.|Yeah, l have.
{111756}{111904}lt doesn't matter if l don't plough this|street. The other streets are ploughed.
{111908}{112061}l'll see you in school tomorrow.|You didn't think of that, did you?
{112065}{112171}- Actually, we did.|- What?
{112175}{112319}Now that you're done ploughing,|we might do a little un-ploughing!
{112383}{112446}No! You can't take Clementine!
{112450}{112620}{y:i}# She was lost and gone forever|Dreadful sorry, Clementine #
{112624}{112680}Yeah!

{113746}{113826}Lane! Lane!
{113921}{113956}Hey, Lane!
{113989}{114022}Hi!
{114225}{114317}To help stop the bleeding,|apply pressure directly to the wound.
{114321}{114423}- Nothing happened between us.|- She'll never leave me.
{114427}{114511}- What do you know?|- What flavour gum does she chew?
{114546}{114677}Like l'm gonna tell you. You're a zero!|You're nothing! A zip!
{114681}{114754}- Go out with other zips.|- l'm not sure l'm following you.
{114758}{114827}l'm Chuck Wheeler.|l go out with Claire Bonner.
{114831}{114906}Yeah? Well, not technically.
{115182}{115229}Unbelievable.
{115326}{115391}- Nats?|- Hal.
{115431}{115525}You saved my butt!|He was gonna kill me!
{115552}{115618}You're driving|Snowploughman's truck?
{115622}{115665}Cool, huh?
{115669}{115768}- Remember l said l didn't need you?|- l guess you weren't kidding.
{115772}{115839}Meltar and l can|take care of the universe no problem.
{115843}{115967}Eh...l borrowed him. Don't worry,|l didn't scratch him or anything.
{115971}{116056}- l swear.|- lt's all right.
{116060}{116134}He belongs to you now.|You've earned him.
{116138}{116244}Just be careful, you two.|There's a lot of bad out there.
{116267}{116314}What's going on?
{116318}{116385}Welcome to the Chet and Wayne|House of Pain.
{116389}{116479}We gotta get going.|Got a lot of un-ploughing to do.
{116483}{116582}- All right. See you at the house.|- Okay.
{116586}{116661}Let's go, Wayne.
{116695}{116782}Nats, since we're gonna have|another snow day tomorrow,
{116786}{116844}l was wondering,|you doing anything?
{116868}{116954}Come on, Nats,|we've got a truck to drive.
{117304}{117434}That's right, Brandston!|Just walk away...chicken.
{117468}{117582}{y:i}# A rose must be made|With the sun and the rain
{117600}{117737}{y:i}# For its loving promise|Won't come true... #
{118078}{118169}Lane! Wait, please, we gotta talk!
{118194}{118322}Where's Claire? Did Miss Fantasy|shoot you down? Gee, what a surprise.
{118326}{118395}No, that's not what happened.
{118399}{118498}- Go away. l have nothing to say.|- Would you just listen?
{118502}{118591}- Before, when you kissed me...|- Hal.
{118595}{118698}- l don't wanna talk about that. Ever.|- Would you just hear me?
{118762}{118878}- Hal...|- My spine. Help, l can't feel my legs.
{118977}{119031}You're pathetic.
{119035}{119113}Looks like you're the one|with the reflexes of a dead cow.
{119298}{119432}- What are you doing? What is all this?|- Wasn't it you who said
{119436}{119598}that love is about finding someone you|can stand to be around for 1 0 minutes?
{119602}{119656}Yeah.
{119660}{119717}You got 1 0 minutes?
{120039}{120123}{y:i}You never really know how|a snow day is going to turn out,
{120127}{120228}{y:i}but by the time the sun goes down,|you might be amazed to discover
{120232}{120287}{y:i}you got to wear pants again...
{120336}{120394}{y:i}..you got your life back...
{120455}{120499}{y:i}..or not.
{120546}{120639}{y:i}And in the end you might discover|that you saved the universe
{120643}{120692}{y:i}and got a second snow day.
{120696}{120809}{y:i}The snow melts, the schools open|and everything returns to normal,
{120813}{120963}{y:i}but the miracle that began with|a snowflake changes your life forever.
