      my legal beagle.

00:45:29,226 --> 00:45:30,258
       And, Harry...

834
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:32,828
                Oh, shut up
                and let's vote!

835
00:45:32,830 --> 00:45:33,829
          Right now?

839
00:45:41,238 --> 00:45:43,371
                  No. Vote now!

           on an empty stomach!

843
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:51,313
    It's a simple "guilty."
    That's it.

844
00:45:51,315 --> 00:45:54,616
   That's it?
   And what about the baby?

 what are you doing?

 is money in the bank.

         Let me see that!

 My! This is unbelievable.
 Which one of you guys
 did this?

915
00:49:11,915 --> 00:49:13,481
    I am shocked...

00:49:16,185 --> 00:49:18,586
 Yes, Principal Beasely, sir?

918
00:49:18,588 --> 00:49:22,691
               There is a "u"
               in "not guilty."

919
00:49:24,293 --> 00:49:25,126
 Are you sure?

920
00:49:25,128 --> 00:49:28,263

  who I haven't seen in
  four years.

00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:36,438
       Did you vote not guilty?

       Yeah.

924
00:49:37,607 --> 00:49:39,808
               How could you...

925
00:49:40,209 --> 00:49:41,476
  And how can you
  vote guilty?

    Goddamn it, Tommy!
    I killed for these tickets.

927
00:49:43,046 --> 00:49:47,515
   If you make me miss the game
   because of your bullshit,
   I'll be pissed off!

928
00:49:47,517 --> 00:49:49,050
          I'll be very,
          very pissed off!

929
00:49:49,052 --> 00:49:53,254
    Now, wait a second.
    I believe even Mr. Collins
    has a right to his opinion.

930
00:49:53,256 --> 00:49:57,525
   Maybe we should discuss
   this before he votes guilty.
