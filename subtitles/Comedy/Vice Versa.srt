1
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,127
- Good morning, Mr. Seymour.
- Morning.

2
00:01:53,128 --> 00:01:55,631
- Good morning, Mr. Seymour.
- Morning, Angela.

3
00:01:55,714 --> 00:01:57,424
- Morning, Mr. Seymour.
- Morning.

4
00:01:57,508 --> 00:01:58,801
- Good morning.
- Morning.

5
00:01:58,926 --> 00:02:01,512
- Charlie, let's go!
- Is Dad coming tonight, Mom?

6
00:02:02,513 --> 00:02:06,601
- I left a message on his machine.
- Call him again. Sometimes he forgets.

7
00:02:06,809 --> 00:02:08,102
- See you, Cliff.
- See you.

8
00:02:08,311 --> 00:02:09,813
- Bye, sweetheart.
- Bye.

9
00:02:13,525 --> 00:02:18,113
Sam, I have to get budget approval
for this South China Seas thing.

10
00:02:18,321 --> 00:02:20,741
That means we have
to go over your wish list.

11
00:02:20,908 --> 00:02:25,120
Not now. I'm looking at furs at 10. I've
got menswear people in from Atlanta.

12
00:02:26,622 --> 00:02:29,708
Where were you this morning?
I woke up and you'd gone.

13
00:02:29,834 --> 00:02:33,004
I told you I had my exercise class.

14
00:02:41,721 --> 00:02:43,306
- Bye.
- Bye.

15
00:02:43,431 --> 00:02:44,933
- Morning, Sam.
- Hi, Sam.

16
00:02:45,141 --> 00:02:48,019
- Yo, Marshall.
- Yo, Marshall.

17
00:02:48,228 --> 00:02:50,731
I hear he's taking Sam
on this Far East junket.

18
00:02:50,939 --> 00:02:53,442
She's a fashion buyer.
She's a logical choice.

19
00:02:53,609 --> 00:02:56,904
So the fact that he's boffing her
has nothing to do with it?

20
00:02:57,112 --> 00:02:59,907
- I said she's a logical choice.
- Oh, cute. Cute.

21
00:03:00,115 --> 00:03:03,703
Confirm lunch with Davidson.
He's from L.A. Better make it sushi.

22
00:03:03,911 --> 00:03:08,541
I'm going to my kid's concert.
You gotta have me out of here by 5.

23
00:03:11,336 --> 00:03:13,338
Good morning.

24
00:03:45,205 --> 00:03:46,915
Unbelievable.

25
00:04:14,235 --> 00:04:15,945
Sorry.

26
00:04:25,247 --> 00:04:27,040
- See you later.
- Bye. Yeah.

27
00:04:27,207 --> 00:04:30,419
- Charlie.
- Hi, Dad.

28
00:04:32,046 --> 00:04:37,134
Charlie, what can I say?
You can't believe the problems I had.

29
00:04:37,218 --> 00:04:40,221
When I get back from my trip,
you're staying with me?

30
00:04:40,429 --> 00:04:43,516
- Yeah.
- When Mom's on vacation?

31
00:04:43,933 --> 00:04:47,312
Charlie, I'm gonna make
it up to you. I swear.

32
00:04:48,313 --> 00:04:52,234
That's okay, Dad.
We've played better.

33
00:04:52,734 --> 00:04:55,737
I guess I'll just have
to buy the album.

34
00:04:57,823 --> 00:05:02,536
Hi. Come on, Charlie. If we're
gonna get a pizza, we gotta move it.

35
00:05:02,745 --> 00:05:04,246
Let's go, Charlie.

36
00:05:18,845 --> 00:05:21,348
My friends, ladies and gentlemen.

37
00:05:21,514 --> 00:05:25,435
Welcome, Mr. Seymour, Miss Crespi,
to Thailand.

38
00:05:25,644 --> 00:05:28,230
We hope you love our country...

39
00:05:28,313 --> 00:05:32,151
...and buy so many things
to take back to America.

40
00:05:32,317 --> 00:05:36,447
- Cheers.
- Cheers. Thank you.

41
00:06:12,151 --> 00:06:15,029
Mr. Turk, long time. Long time.

42
00:06:15,238 --> 00:06:19,617
If this business doesn't kill me, the
stairs will. I hope the climb's won'th it.

43
00:06:19,826 --> 00:06:21,452
- Same old Mr. Turk.
- Right.

44
00:06:21,536 --> 00:06:25,332
- You look good.
- Yeah, a regular movie star.

45
00:06:25,832 --> 00:06:28,043
What do you got for me?

46
00:06:28,251 --> 00:06:32,214
Always business first, huh, Mr. Turk?

47
00:06:44,852 --> 00:06:49,315
- What's with lmelda?
- Nothing. Old Lady. Superstitious.

48
00:06:49,524 --> 00:06:51,943
- It's real gold.
- Yes.

49
00:06:52,151 --> 00:06:54,821
Very rare. From Tibet.

50
00:06:55,029 --> 00:06:57,449
The lamas believe in reincarnation.

51
00:06:57,532 --> 00:07:02,037
They use it in religious ceremonies
to change the house of spirit.

52
00:07:02,245 --> 00:07:08,252
Don't try to up the ante with that tourist
bullshit, Kwo. Five grand.

53
00:07:08,419 --> 00:07:12,131
Five thousand dollars?
Pure gold! Precious stone!

54
00:07:12,339 --> 00:07:14,633
I think in America you get $ 100,000.

55
00:07:14,842 --> 00:07:18,221
You know how many payoffs
I gotta make to get this to America?

56
00:07:18,429 --> 00:07:22,433
Thais come down harder on art lovers
like me than they do on dope dealers.

57
00:07:23,351 --> 00:07:27,439
Five grand. Take it or leave it.

58
00:07:32,152 --> 00:07:33,445
What did you say?

59
00:07:33,528 --> 00:07:37,533
I tell him this one's fragile,
so take great care.

60
00:07:39,827 --> 00:07:44,039
Hey, I want this to go
with the rest of the samples. $ 1.50.

61
00:07:44,123 --> 00:07:47,752
I bought all the guy had.
The store puts a lampshade on this...

62
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:49,754
...retails for, what, 75, 80?

63
00:07:49,921 --> 00:07:54,259
Nothing like a 600-percent markup
to put a smile on your face.

64
00:07:54,425 --> 00:07:57,720
- These will be on our flight tomorrow?
- Yes. Government deal.

65
00:07:57,929 --> 00:08:02,559
- No problem with customs.
- Okay, I'd like this to go too, please.

66
00:08:19,535 --> 00:08:22,830
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Excuse me. Incredibly sorry.

67
00:08:28,044 --> 00:08:31,923
Where did they come from? They
werert there when I went to the phone.

68
00:08:32,132 --> 00:08:34,634
You've been gone
for a half an hour, Marshall.

69
00:08:34,843 --> 00:08:38,430
I swear to God, that's it for work.
How are the drinks?

70
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:40,933
Look at you. You're lethal, right?

71
00:08:41,725 --> 00:08:46,021
Can we have a couple more of these?
I have plans for tonight.

72
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:50,651
Tonight, we'll experience the wonder
of Marshall Seymour in the Orient.

73
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:51,861
I promise.

74
00:08:52,028 --> 00:08:55,323
If you don't, I'm gonna show
everyone this at work.

75
00:08:55,531 --> 00:08:58,243
- No, you're not. I don't think so.
- I think so.

76
00:08:58,451 --> 00:09:00,537
I don't think you will. No.

77
00:09:00,745 --> 00:09:03,748
- Why don't I take one of the two of you.
- Great.

78
00:09:03,832 --> 00:09:06,543
- Thanks.
- My pleasure.

79
00:09:09,129 --> 00:09:11,423
That's great.

80
00:09:11,548 --> 00:09:14,051
- Where you from, New York?
- England.

81
00:09:20,558 --> 00:09:23,060
Fernando in Milan will flip
when he sees these.

82
00:09:23,227 --> 00:09:27,523
They're woven, not printed, so he can
design a range of V & A exclusives...

83
00:09:27,732 --> 00:09:30,026
...and we can make them up
in Bangkok.

84
00:09:30,944 --> 00:09:35,657
Sorry I'm late, Mr. Avery. I've been
busy putting everything together.

85
00:09:36,032 --> 00:09:39,828
- One of your happy snaps, Marshall?
- Give me that, Floyd.

86
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:43,040
- May I see?
- Sure.

87
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:45,626
Just a rare moment of leisure, sir.

88
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:49,463
We had to eat!

89
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:52,425
If you ever go, sir,
I recommend the Drunken Fish.

90
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:55,428
As long as the trip wasrt
entirely pleasurable.

91
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:57,263
Since you left...

92
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:01,434
...there have been strong doubts about
your South China Seas promotion.

93
00:10:01,643 --> 00:10:03,228
I can imagine.

94
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:06,856
At the moment, there is a complete
uniformity of approach...

95
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,650
...to marketing in this city.

96
00:10:08,859 --> 00:10:13,739
Our competition is selling the same
merchandise we are in the same way.

97
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:17,159
This Eastern concept is exotic,
provocative, exciting.

98
00:10:17,326 --> 00:10:19,161
- Passion.
- As I've said before...

99
00:10:19,328 --> 00:10:22,748
...we have to make sure our marketing
strategy is more aggressive...

100
00:10:22,957 --> 00:10:26,043
...more imaginative
than the other guys'.

101
00:10:26,127 --> 00:10:27,628
With this in mind...

102
00:10:27,753 --> 00:10:32,467
...I think you'll see we've made
very exciting acquisitions on our trip.

103
00:10:32,634 --> 00:10:35,261
Let me show you this little sucker.

104
00:10:36,137 --> 00:10:39,641
I'm estimating a profit
of six to 700 percent.

105
00:10:40,642 --> 00:10:43,061
That's why I bought 5000 of them.

106
00:10:47,649 --> 00:10:50,653
You bought how many?

107
00:10:53,364 --> 00:10:57,159
Could I speak to Mr. Seymour, please?
Mr. Marshall Seymour.

108
00:10:57,243 --> 00:11:00,163
Yes, of course I'll hold.
You are unbelievable.

109
00:11:00,329 --> 00:11:04,167
I know people who'd pay a fortune
for this and you send it to Chicago.

110
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:06,461
Couldrt you find a mule
coming to New York?

111
00:11:06,628 --> 00:11:12,467
<i>What did you expect? An ad in the
Bangkok Post: "Smugglers Wanted"?</i>

112
00:11:12,634 --> 00:11:14,761
It was sloppy to use a civilian.

113
00:11:14,928 --> 00:11:16,263
Mr. Seymour...

114
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:21,352
...Lillian Brookmeyer. I believe we were
on the same flight from Bangkok.

115
00:11:21,435 --> 00:11:24,230
And there seems to have been
a terrible mix-up.

116
00:11:24,355 --> 00:11:27,358
I seem to have this darling
blue and white ginger jar...

117
00:11:27,566 --> 00:11:30,069
...and I wonder if you have
something of mine.

118
00:11:35,658 --> 00:11:40,747
Don't ask me how it happened. It's
fortunate I'll be in Chicago tomorrow...

119
00:11:40,956 --> 00:11:43,458
Monday would be fine. Yes.

120
00:11:43,667 --> 00:11:47,045
At your office? Look forward to it.

121
00:11:47,462 --> 00:11:51,467
- Look forward to Chicago in December?
- Come on, it's in the U.S.

122
00:11:51,633 --> 00:11:55,346
- Monday, it's ours. No problem.
- You think so?

123
00:11:57,556 --> 00:12:00,059
Credit me with some intelligence.

124
00:12:02,353 --> 00:12:04,856
On what basis?

125
00:12:05,356 --> 00:12:08,568
Major, major, major dork.

126
00:12:08,651 --> 00:12:12,364
<i>Attention K-Mart shoppers:
This offer cannot be repeated.</i>

127
00:12:12,572 --> 00:12:14,032
Dooley, who you got?

128
00:12:14,241 --> 00:12:18,245
I got Blackhawks and Whalers,
Van Halen at the Civic, and Malice.

129
00:12:18,453 --> 00:12:21,165
- Can you get tickets for Wang Chung?
- Sure.

130
00:12:21,665 --> 00:12:25,544
- Get me two for Malice.
- Two? Who you taking? Lori?

131
00:12:25,753 --> 00:12:27,463
I don't go out with boys.

132
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:30,633
Will your dad let you go?

133
00:12:30,758 --> 00:12:33,135
I'll get him to take me.
He owes me one.

134
00:12:33,636 --> 00:12:37,640
I can hear you people
in the parking lot. Dooley, get out!

135
00:12:37,765 --> 00:12:40,435
Out! You're not scalping tickets
in my classroom.

136
00:12:40,643 --> 00:12:47,067
Sit down! Take off that headset
and give me that filthy magazine.

137
00:12:57,036 --> 00:13:00,664
Go, Charlie!
Yes, yes! Come on, come on!

138
00:13:01,165 --> 00:13:03,542
Go, go, go, Charlie!
Come on, touchdown!

139
00:13:03,751 --> 00:13:06,838
All right! All right!

140
00:13:07,463 --> 00:13:09,841
You're really sparking them, Charlie.

141
00:13:10,049 --> 00:13:11,968
All right, touchdown!

142
00:13:13,845 --> 00:13:15,555
Hi, guys.

143
00:13:16,973 --> 00:13:19,851
- Come on.
- Let's go. We can afford them now.

144
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,646
- Over here! Over here!
- Get the ball!

145
00:13:22,854 --> 00:13:24,565
- I got them!
- Run! Run!

146
00:13:24,773 --> 00:13:27,443
- Quick, throw it!
- I'm open. Open.

147
00:13:30,154 --> 00:13:32,656
- Who's that?
- My dad.

148
00:13:35,952 --> 00:13:40,248
- I'm sorry about that, Marshall.
- No, come on, it was a good pass.

149
00:13:40,456 --> 00:13:43,168
It was never my game, you know?
I used to row.

150
00:13:43,376 --> 00:13:46,838
No, I meant the sweater.
It looks like it's expensive.

151
00:13:46,963 --> 00:13:50,550
I get a good deal at the store.
You want one? I could get you one.

152
00:13:50,967 --> 00:13:52,970
Charlie, get your stuff together.

153
00:13:53,178 --> 00:13:55,347
- See you.
- See you later, Charlie.

154
00:13:55,556 --> 00:14:00,144
This is the hotel we're staying in
if there's any kind of problem.

155
00:14:00,352 --> 00:14:02,772
He eats Nerds for breakfast,
not croissants.

156
00:14:02,938 --> 00:14:05,066
Help him with homework.
He has exams.

157
00:14:05,149 --> 00:14:08,277
You have to see his homeroom teacher
Tuesday afternoon.

158
00:14:08,361 --> 00:14:13,157
Tuesday afternoon? Oh, my God!
I've got to meet with our ad agency.

159
00:14:13,366 --> 00:14:16,578
Cancel it. It won't kill you
to be a parent for a week.

160
00:14:16,745 --> 00:14:18,455
Christ.

161
00:14:18,663 --> 00:14:23,043
Charlie? No, Charlie. Please.

162
00:14:23,251 --> 00:14:26,964
Charlie, no way.
I got a clause in my lease.

163
00:14:38,643 --> 00:14:41,562
Okay, old buddy,
you unload your arsenal...

164
00:14:41,771 --> 00:14:44,357
- Hey, you got a tree!
- Yeah.

165
00:14:44,566 --> 00:14:47,152
Sure. Of course I got you a tree.

166
00:14:48,862 --> 00:14:50,780
Well, Sam got it for you.

167
00:14:50,864 --> 00:14:53,867
Look at the pine needles.
Goddamn it! I told her.

168
00:14:54,076 --> 00:14:57,371
I told her there'd be pine needles
all over the rug.

169
00:14:57,871 --> 00:15:00,249
I'm gonna check my messages.

170
00:15:10,551 --> 00:15:11,969
Hi, Mo.

171
00:15:12,178 --> 00:15:13,971
Did you have a nice ride?

172
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:16,474
Were you okay in there?

173
00:15:16,641 --> 00:15:19,477
Look, this is my dad's den.

174
00:15:19,561 --> 00:15:22,981
I'm gonna sleep on the bed.
And you're gonna sleep in here.

175
00:15:23,064 --> 00:15:25,275
We won't tell my dad you're staying.

176
00:15:25,442 --> 00:15:28,779
There's probably a clause in his lease.

177
00:15:57,184 --> 00:15:58,977
Why can't you take me to school?

178
00:15:59,061 --> 00:16:02,564
George Ferriera takes his kid to school
on his way to work.

179
00:16:02,648 --> 00:16:05,651
- I go in the opposite direction.
- You don't know Dale.

180
00:16:05,776 --> 00:16:07,862
- He's a real asshole.
- Charlie!

181
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:09,947
Language, in front of Sam.

182
00:16:14,786 --> 00:16:16,454
Pasquale.

183
00:16:18,081 --> 00:16:22,168
- Is he a real asshole?
- Major.

184
00:16:22,585 --> 00:16:23,962
A little Grey Poupon.

185
00:16:25,171 --> 00:16:26,381
Thank you.

186
00:16:26,548 --> 00:16:30,469
I can't take you to school, but I'll
do anything else you want. Deal?

187
00:16:30,677 --> 00:16:32,554
Can we see Malice at the Riviera?

188
00:16:33,472 --> 00:16:36,058
Is that an Agatha Christie movie?

189
00:16:37,059 --> 00:16:39,061
It's a heavy-duty rock band.

190
00:16:39,687 --> 00:16:41,147
I'll get us both a ticket.

191
00:16:41,355 --> 00:16:45,776
- No way. You have tests.
- Music is my life, Dad!

192
00:16:47,069 --> 00:16:50,281
- You had a deal.
- Oh, come on. He has tests this week.

193
00:16:50,448 --> 00:16:54,577
You can't expect me to take him to one
of those drugged-out rock shows.

194
00:16:54,786 --> 00:16:56,371
- Where'd he go?
- He's upset.

195
00:16:56,454 --> 00:17:00,876
- What's he got to be upset about?
- Just lighten up, okay?

196
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:02,377
Charlie.

197
00:17:05,172 --> 00:17:06,673
What are you doing?

198
00:17:07,383 --> 00:17:09,760
- Mo has escaped.
- Who's Mo?

199
00:17:09,969 --> 00:17:11,679
My frog.

200
00:17:16,267 --> 00:17:17,560
Damn it.

201
00:17:17,768 --> 00:17:21,773
- Pasquale, we have a problem.
- The linguine is not al dente?

202
00:17:25,568 --> 00:17:27,779
My frog! My frog!

203
00:17:28,655 --> 00:17:31,450
- It's a rat!
- It's not a rat! It's my frog!

204
00:17:33,076 --> 00:17:36,455
- It's not the linguine.
- Mo, where are you?

205
00:17:38,165 --> 00:17:41,460
Jesus Christ.
What is this, a rummage sale?

206
00:17:41,669 --> 00:17:43,087
Charlie.

207
00:17:43,754 --> 00:17:46,465
I can't believe you're
this messy at your mom's.

208
00:17:46,674 --> 00:17:50,261
You stay with me a few days,
all hell breaks loose. Look at this.

209
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:52,764
Charlie!
In the future, eat in the kitchen!

210
00:17:52,972 --> 00:17:55,350
There's granola all over the rug.

211
00:17:58,061 --> 00:18:00,981
Make sure you take that damn frog
back to school.

212
00:18:01,189 --> 00:18:02,858
If I do, they'll dissect him.

213
00:18:03,066 --> 00:18:06,486
That's what a frog is for.
This isn't a wildlife refuge.

214
00:18:06,653 --> 00:18:10,282
People are always trying to save
whales and baby seals and stuff.

215
00:18:10,491 --> 00:18:13,786
- What's wrong with saving a frog?
- He's not staying here.

216
00:18:13,869 --> 00:18:16,789
If we're not wanted here,
we can go stay with Eric.

217
00:18:16,872 --> 00:18:21,586
Oh, really? I guess at Eric's house
there's a frog in every room.

218
00:18:22,587 --> 00:18:26,090
Look, I just can't believe what you did
last night, that's all.

219
00:18:26,257 --> 00:18:30,470
I can't ever go back to that restaurant
after your friend went table-hopping.

220
00:18:30,679 --> 00:18:35,058
- Stop dumping on me, Dad!
- I'm not dumping on you.

221
00:18:35,183 --> 00:18:38,562
I've been up since 6,
and I have a very tough day ahead.

222
00:18:39,354 --> 00:18:41,190
I have a tough day ahead too.

223
00:18:41,356 --> 00:18:44,068
You're going to school,
for God's sake.

224
00:18:44,276 --> 00:18:49,657
School is games, fun and goofing off.
It's the best time of your life.

225
00:18:49,865 --> 00:18:51,492
You mean it gets worse?

226
00:18:51,659 --> 00:18:54,954
Wait till you have to work.
You'll find out how much worse.

227
00:18:55,163 --> 00:18:58,666
- I told you to leave that alone.
- You don't take tests at work.

228
00:18:58,875 --> 00:19:02,754
I bet people don't push you around,
calling you "shrimp" and "microbe."

229
00:19:03,672 --> 00:19:06,675
You know, I wish I could
change places with you.

230
00:19:06,758 --> 00:19:10,470
Yeah? Well, I wish I could too.

231
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:38,458
Dad!

232
00:19:40,377 --> 00:19:42,880
Charlie! Charlie!

233
00:19:44,673 --> 00:19:46,175
Dad?

234
00:19:46,675 --> 00:19:48,886
Daddy!

235
00:19:53,057 --> 00:19:54,392
Charlie!

236
00:19:55,768 --> 00:19:57,562
Daddy!

237
00:20:27,677 --> 00:20:30,597
You look just like me.

238
00:20:31,264 --> 00:20:34,267
I think I am you...

239
00:20:34,392 --> 00:20:36,061
...Dad.

240
00:20:37,979 --> 00:20:39,898
And you're me.

241
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:46,989
Holy shit!

242
00:20:48,282 --> 00:20:49,700
Dad?

243
00:20:49,992 --> 00:20:51,577
Dad?

244
00:20:59,168 --> 00:21:03,298
- What's happening, Dad?
- Son of a bitch!

245
00:21:07,093 --> 00:21:09,179
I'm scared.

246
00:21:09,888 --> 00:21:14,685
Don't cry, Charlie. It's a dream.
We're having a dream.

247
00:21:14,893 --> 00:21:19,690
The same dream?
We woke up a half an hour ago!

248
00:21:21,692 --> 00:21:24,987
If we're dreaming,
you won't feel this.

249
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:30,993
There must be a perfectly
logical explanation for this.

250
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,000
Maybe this happened
all over America.

251
00:21:38,001 --> 00:21:40,587
Invasion of the Body Switchers.

252
00:21:40,795 --> 00:21:43,882
Your mother lets you watch
too much television.

253
00:21:44,091 --> 00:21:47,970
It's some kind of hallucination.
I shouldn't have taken all that Valium.

254
00:21:48,178 --> 00:21:50,472
Hey, this is neat.

255
00:21:50,681 --> 00:21:54,602
It can happen.
People do have nervous breakdowns.

256
00:21:59,774 --> 00:22:01,275
Yeah.

257
00:22:04,278 --> 00:22:05,863
Right.

258
00:22:07,991 --> 00:22:12,871
That was Dale's father.
He's picking you up in 20 minutes.

259
00:22:13,205 --> 00:22:16,166
Oh, my God, this is for real.

260
00:22:20,504 --> 00:22:22,965
It was this.
You were holding it. You said...

261
00:22:23,173 --> 00:22:25,301
I know what I said.

262
00:22:25,467 --> 00:22:27,595
I said I wish we could change places.

263
00:22:28,888 --> 00:22:32,683
Somebody must have thought it was
a pretty good idea, because we have.

264
00:22:33,392 --> 00:22:38,481
So you better get dressed, because
you're going to school in 20 minutes.

265
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:40,692
Don't be crazy. I can't go to school.

266
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:44,696
It'd look pretty weird if I go to school.
I must weigh 200 pounds.

267
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:47,074
A hundred and seventy-six.

268
00:22:47,282 --> 00:22:51,995
Give me that! Give it back!
Give that to me! Give that back!

269
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:53,372
- Nope!
- Give it back!

270
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:58,002
You can ride with Dale.
You can look at Mrs. Luttrell.

271
00:22:58,085 --> 00:23:00,296
And you can take my tests.

272
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:04,300
I'll get straight A's. Awesome!

273
00:23:04,467 --> 00:23:07,887
We are not leaving this apartment.

274
00:23:08,388 --> 00:23:11,391
Try and remember,
I am still your father.

275
00:23:15,103 --> 00:23:19,608
Try and remember,
I'm bigger than you now.

276
00:23:25,781 --> 00:23:30,578
Oh, my God! My report! I was
supposed to get it to Avery today.

277
00:23:30,786 --> 00:23:34,081
Call Marcie. Tell her I'm sick.
You're sick.

278
00:23:38,086 --> 00:23:42,173
- Hey, that's my wallet.
- You'll need some lunch money.

279
00:23:43,675 --> 00:23:47,888
- Look at all this plastic!
- Don't even think it.

280
00:23:49,806 --> 00:23:52,684
It's been a long while
since you went to school, Dad.

281
00:23:52,893 --> 00:23:56,688
<i>- What do you mean?
- It's not like Happy Days anymore.</i>

282
00:23:56,897 --> 00:23:58,482
All I'm saying is...

283
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,902
...be careful out there.

284
00:24:14,499 --> 00:24:17,794
- Hi, how you doing?
- I've known better days, George.

285
00:24:18,003 --> 00:24:22,674
- Excuse me?
- I mean, Mr. Ferriera.

286
00:24:31,809 --> 00:24:33,686
Raccoon turd.

287
00:24:33,894 --> 00:24:36,272
I'm sorry, I didn't catch that.

288
00:25:22,404 --> 00:25:25,490
Son of a bitch.

289
00:25:27,075 --> 00:25:28,577
Hey, Charlie.

290
00:25:28,911 --> 00:25:30,913
Was Maggot Mouth
giving you a bad time?

291
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:35,209
He's a depressing indictment
of our educational system.

292
00:25:35,376 --> 00:25:38,379
Oh, you mean he's like a moron?

293
00:25:38,587 --> 00:25:41,299
- So how's it with your dad?
- Why do you ask?

294
00:25:41,507 --> 00:25:44,677
You said you didn't think staying
there would be much fun.

295
00:25:44,802 --> 00:25:46,804
My father is a wonderful person.

296
00:25:46,888 --> 00:25:50,100
People don't realize that he's
under enormous pressure.

297
00:25:50,308 --> 00:25:53,103
Hey, if you guys are interfacing,
that's cool.

298
00:25:53,687 --> 00:25:57,482
- Who are you, anyway?
- You're getting weird, Charlie.

299
00:25:57,691 --> 00:25:59,610
Well, I gotta go.

300
00:26:06,575 --> 00:26:07,910
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

301
00:26:08,077 --> 00:26:12,081
I have a problem. Could you tell me
where I'm supposed to go?

302
00:26:12,415 --> 00:26:15,877
You suppose your amnesia is induced
by piping heavy-metal music...

303
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:17,587
...into your brain cells?

304
00:26:17,795 --> 00:26:20,298
I asked a perfectly
straightforward question.

305
00:26:20,507 --> 00:26:23,218
I'd appreciate
a straightforward answer.

306
00:26:41,278 --> 00:26:43,197
Keep the change.

307
00:27:09,183 --> 00:27:12,186
- Good morning, Mr. Seymour.
- Morning.

308
00:27:12,311 --> 00:27:13,980
- Good morning, Mr. Seymour.
- Hi.

309
00:27:14,188 --> 00:27:16,816
- Good morning, Mr. Seymour.
- Good morning.

310
00:28:06,118 --> 00:28:08,412
Morning, Mr. Seymour.

311
00:28:16,712 --> 00:28:19,215
Careful! Get back! Get back!

312
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,021
- Yo, Marshall.
- Yo, Marshall.

313
00:28:33,188 --> 00:28:37,109
- Yo, Marshall.
- Hi. I mean, yo.

314
00:28:37,317 --> 00:28:40,195
Boy, did Braverman luck out.
That's his newest temp.

315
00:28:40,404 --> 00:28:43,991
You ever seen such an available
mouth? I bet it's nice in there.

316
00:28:44,116 --> 00:28:46,285
Be a good place to set up camp.

317
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:49,789
- Tom Sawyer's swimming hole, eh?
- Yeah.

318
00:28:49,997 --> 00:28:51,415
Is my office down here?

319
00:28:53,584 --> 00:28:57,213
It's where it always was,
unless you know something we don't.

320
00:28:58,298 --> 00:28:59,591
Thanks.

321
00:29:02,093 --> 00:29:06,098
- Sneakers.
- I know. He's losing it.

322
00:29:06,306 --> 00:29:09,309
Elliot Webb was like that
right before his breakdown.

323
00:29:09,393 --> 00:29:14,899
Week after that, he was in a window
wearing the new Balenciaga ball gown.

324
00:29:17,109 --> 00:29:18,819
Morning, Marshall.

325
00:29:19,904 --> 00:29:22,990
- Marcie?
- Yes?

326
00:29:23,116 --> 00:29:26,995
Good morning, Marcie.
I trust you had a pleasant weekend.

327
00:29:27,996 --> 00:29:29,706
Are you all right?

328
00:29:31,499 --> 00:29:32,792
Don't I look all right?

329
00:29:34,294 --> 00:29:37,214
In four years, you've never asked me
about my weekend.

330
00:29:39,925 --> 00:29:41,218
Sorry.

331
00:29:41,426 --> 00:29:45,097
I kept your appointments light
so you could finish your report.

332
00:29:46,015 --> 00:29:47,600
It's finished!

333
00:29:47,808 --> 00:29:50,019
I got it right here!

334
00:29:52,688 --> 00:29:54,315
Good.

335
00:29:55,608 --> 00:29:59,112
If you want me,
I'll be in my office. Okay?

336
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:00,613
Great.

337
00:30:07,996 --> 00:30:10,207
Good. I need some envelopes...

338
00:30:10,415 --> 00:30:12,292
...and some pencils.

339
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:15,713
Some pens.

340
00:30:37,903 --> 00:30:39,613
Look, Mo.

341
00:30:40,697 --> 00:30:42,407
Downtown.

342
00:30:42,991 --> 00:30:45,327
It's a big city.

343
00:30:51,208 --> 00:30:54,128
A Jacuzzi for you.

344
00:30:54,629 --> 00:30:59,008
Cool out, pal.
It must have been hot in there, huh?

345
00:31:42,512 --> 00:31:44,806
I was just exercising.

346
00:31:45,933 --> 00:31:47,935
Chair aerobics?

347
00:31:57,820 --> 00:31:59,906
- Yes?
- I need to make a phone call.

348
00:32:00,406 --> 00:32:02,825
You're in the middle of a test.

349
00:32:03,034 --> 00:32:04,410
I finished.

350
00:32:07,497 --> 00:32:08,915
Sit down!

351
00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:14,713
Well, do you have a newspaper?

352
00:32:25,015 --> 00:32:27,017
- Sam!
- I can't have lunch today.

353
00:32:27,226 --> 00:32:30,021
There's too much to catch up on.

354
00:32:30,313 --> 00:32:31,814
Great to see you.

355
00:32:32,023 --> 00:32:34,525
Which is a shame,
because we need to talk.

356
00:32:36,236 --> 00:32:38,112
Is there a problem?

357
00:32:40,824 --> 00:32:44,536
Basically, I just don't know
whether working together...

358
00:32:44,619 --> 00:32:47,122
...and having a relationship
is feasible.

359
00:32:51,001 --> 00:32:54,505
I don't know what "feasible" means.

360
00:32:54,713 --> 00:32:57,007
Nor do I anymore.
That's just the point.

361
00:32:59,009 --> 00:33:01,012
I'll do anything you want, Sam.

362
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:03,806
Marshall, it's not what I want.

363
00:33:04,015 --> 00:33:06,309
It's what we want as a unit...

364
00:33:06,517 --> 00:33:08,603
...if we are still a unit.

365
00:33:08,728 --> 00:33:13,024
When we get together tomorrow night,
I think we have to be open...

366
00:33:13,233 --> 00:33:16,903
...and candid and re-evaluate
this whole situation.

367
00:33:17,112 --> 00:33:18,739
Okay?

368
00:33:18,905 --> 00:33:20,532
Okay.

369
00:33:21,909 --> 00:33:23,702
Bye.

370
00:33:34,922 --> 00:33:38,009
<i>This is Marshall. Can't come
to the phone. Leave a message.</i>

371
00:33:38,217 --> 00:33:41,221
Oh, my God! He's out!

372
00:33:42,931 --> 00:33:45,433
Hey, kid, I gotta use the phone.

373
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:49,438
And I need to speak to my secretary.
Do you mind?

374
00:34:01,409 --> 00:34:04,036
Mr. Seymour's office.
Sorry to keep you waiting.

375
00:34:04,203 --> 00:34:06,038
Marcie, thank God!

376
00:34:06,205 --> 00:34:07,540
Who is this?

377
00:34:07,623 --> 00:34:09,834
It's me, Charlie.

378
00:34:10,001 --> 00:34:14,214
Hi, Charlie. Your daddy's told
me so much about you.

379
00:34:14,422 --> 00:34:16,841
<i>- Never mind that. Did my dad show up?
- Sure.</i>

380
00:34:16,925 --> 00:34:19,511
I don't believe it.
How could he do this to me?

381
00:34:19,636 --> 00:34:21,930
Let me speak to him.

382
00:34:22,306 --> 00:34:24,016
He just stepped out to lunch.

383
00:34:25,017 --> 00:34:28,604
If he behaves a little silly today,
it's probably the jet lag.

384
00:34:28,812 --> 00:34:33,317
So don't make any appointments,
and keep Avery off his back.

385
00:34:36,237 --> 00:34:40,408
That was Marshall's kid. The little prick
sounds just like his father.

386
00:34:46,915 --> 00:34:49,417
I don't suppose you have
any Grey Poupon?

387
00:34:49,626 --> 00:34:50,710
What?

388
00:34:56,008 --> 00:34:58,343
Hey, watch it, Dale.

389
00:34:59,011 --> 00:35:00,804
We're sorry about that.

390
00:35:01,722 --> 00:35:03,641
I didn't mean to.

391
00:35:07,645 --> 00:35:11,232
Hey, the assholes
are taking over the world, man.

392
00:35:11,441 --> 00:35:14,819
Consolation. The Dool has delivered.

393
00:35:15,028 --> 00:35:17,030
What's in there, drugs?

394
00:35:17,238 --> 00:35:19,741
Your concert tickets.
I want cash tomorrow.

395
00:35:19,824 --> 00:35:24,538
Checks will only be accepted when
accompanied by two major credit cards.

396
00:35:24,746 --> 00:35:26,707
- Mrs. Brookmeyer to see you.
- Who?

397
00:35:26,915 --> 00:35:30,210
You made the appointment
yourself on Friday.

398
00:35:30,419 --> 00:35:32,338
Did I?

399
00:35:32,546 --> 00:35:34,006
Come on.

400
00:35:35,341 --> 00:35:39,220
Mr. Seymour, good of you
to find the time.

401
00:35:39,428 --> 00:35:40,721
How you doing?

402
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:45,226
I wrote a savage letter to the airline
president. I urge you to do the same.

403
00:35:45,435 --> 00:35:47,020
Sure.

404
00:35:55,946 --> 00:36:00,117
I imagine your store will put
a handsome markup on that.

405
00:36:00,242 --> 00:36:01,910
I guess.

406
00:36:13,423 --> 00:36:15,425
So...

407
00:36:15,717 --> 00:36:18,011
...do you have my little objet d'art?

408
00:36:19,846 --> 00:36:23,725
I'm sorry. I don't know
what you're talking about.

409
00:36:24,434 --> 00:36:28,021
Mr. Seymour, when we spoke
on the phone Friday...

410
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:31,024
...you knew exactly
what I was talking about.

411
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:37,239
Well, a lot's happened since Friday.

412
00:36:37,448 --> 00:36:38,949
Oh, really?

413
00:36:39,116 --> 00:36:41,118
Really.

414
00:36:41,243 --> 00:36:44,413
I see. Maybe since Friday
you realized what you got.

415
00:36:44,622 --> 00:36:47,750
Maybe you had it valued
and think you can make a few bucks.

416
00:36:47,917 --> 00:36:51,921
- Is that what you're trying to pull?
- You have to talk to my dad.

417
00:36:52,130 --> 00:36:54,925
I didn't fly in from New York
to be jerked around.

418
00:36:55,133 --> 00:36:57,719
And you and your dad
better think about this.

419
00:36:57,928 --> 00:37:00,722
Because let me
tell you something, buster...

420
00:37:00,931 --> 00:37:05,144
...you're dealing with a major
ball-breaker here.

421
00:37:12,818 --> 00:37:16,531
Wow! A ball-breaker.

422
00:37:20,034 --> 00:37:23,830
- I need to make a call.
- There's a pay phone in the cafeteria.

423
00:37:24,039 --> 00:37:28,043
There's a line a mile long,
and this is an emergency.

424
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:35,551
<i>Yeah, my name is Seymour.
My account number is 4126.</i>

425
00:37:35,634 --> 00:37:39,722
I need a limo at Hemingway
Junior High, ASAP.

426
00:37:39,930 --> 00:37:41,515
Right.

427
00:37:42,224 --> 00:37:44,352
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

428
00:37:56,614 --> 00:38:00,327
- Where are you going, Marshall?
- Nowhere.

429
00:38:01,328 --> 00:38:04,748
- What's with you today?
- Nothing.

430
00:38:04,831 --> 00:38:07,418
You've been acting weird all day.

431
00:38:07,543 --> 00:38:10,546
Go home. Take a pill.

432
00:38:10,754 --> 00:38:12,715
Okay.

433
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:22,350
Look, we're not going to a funeral.
Peel rubber, pal.

434
00:38:50,421 --> 00:38:51,923
Good afternoon, Mr. Seymour.

435
00:38:53,925 --> 00:38:55,426
Hi.

436
00:38:55,635 --> 00:38:57,554
Coleman, sir.

437
00:39:00,557 --> 00:39:03,852
- That thing is intense.
- State of the art, sir.

438
00:39:04,144 --> 00:39:07,731
- How much does it cost?
- A little under $ 7000.

439
00:39:09,733 --> 00:39:12,152
That's more than a Datsun.

440
00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:17,950
- Pretty hot lick.
- I know.

441
00:39:18,034 --> 00:39:20,328
I play the drums.

442
00:39:22,121 --> 00:39:24,040
Go for it.

443
00:39:40,557 --> 00:39:42,935
Nice fill, Mr. Seymour.

444
00:39:51,235 --> 00:39:53,154
Wait.

445
00:39:53,446 --> 00:39:57,825
- He famous?
- He will be. I'm gonna kill him!

446
00:40:24,437 --> 00:40:27,857
- I know why Marshall's acting so weird.
- It's obvious.

447
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:31,236
Marshall's out on a limb
over this South China Seas deal.

448
00:40:31,361 --> 00:40:35,240
- No, he's just sucking up to Avery.
- Lf this thing takes a nosedive...

449
00:40:35,323 --> 00:40:38,034
...he'll be lucky to run
the hardware department.

450
00:40:38,243 --> 00:40:40,037
Yeah, in the South China Seas.

451
00:40:44,625 --> 00:40:47,336
Oh, that's right.

452
00:40:47,544 --> 00:40:49,964
- Have you been on the fourth floor?
- No, sir.

453
00:40:50,047 --> 00:40:53,926
Apparently, Marshall is in the music
department playing the drums.

454
00:41:23,624 --> 00:41:29,046
- Don't stop now, we're really wailing!
- It's Mr. Avery, Mr. Seymour.

455
00:41:29,255 --> 00:41:34,052
What's going on?! This is
Vigar & Avery, not a nightclub.

456
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:37,347
Chill out. I was...
He's a customer.

457
00:41:37,555 --> 00:41:40,851
You're a vice president
of this company, not a salesman.

458
00:41:41,059 --> 00:41:44,062
- Salesperson, Mr. Avery.
- Person.

459
00:41:44,229 --> 00:41:48,442
All those years of hard work
and my career is down the crapper.

460
00:41:48,650 --> 00:41:52,863
- Did you pick out a Christmas present?
- Sylvia!

461
00:41:54,532 --> 00:41:58,953
Stratford! Charles was just saying
at dinner last night...

462
00:41:59,036 --> 00:42:01,664
...we don't see enough of Stratford.
- Was he?

463
00:42:01,831 --> 00:42:04,834
I was at the club Thursday,
but you were in Bermuda.

464
00:42:05,043 --> 00:42:07,545
We're in town for at least a month.
Call us.

465
00:42:07,754 --> 00:42:11,466
- Wrap what he wants and deliver it.
- This will do fine.

466
00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:13,427
Nice jamming with you.

467
00:42:15,053 --> 00:42:19,141
Well done, Marshall. I never
would have recognized the boy.

468
00:42:19,349 --> 00:42:23,854
And you know how much money
his mother spends here.

469
00:42:23,938 --> 00:42:28,150
Business is war, gentlemen.
Gentlepersons.

470
00:42:28,359 --> 00:42:32,029
Without sales, we might as well raise
the white flag and surrender...

471
00:42:32,238 --> 00:42:36,242
...to the forces of Neiman Marcus.
Marshall didn't forget that.

472
00:42:36,367 --> 00:42:38,036
Learn.

473
00:42:41,164 --> 00:42:42,833
Hi, Dad.

474
00:42:44,835 --> 00:42:46,962
What did you do to my nose?

475
00:42:48,130 --> 00:42:49,840
What?

476
00:42:50,048 --> 00:42:52,051
What?

477
00:42:52,968 --> 00:42:55,763
I wish we could change back again.

478
00:43:01,769 --> 00:43:05,148
- Nothing.
- Dad, this is heavy.

479
00:43:05,732 --> 00:43:08,943
- What if we're stuck like this?
- Oh, my God.

480
00:43:09,235 --> 00:43:13,156
I'll have to go through puberty again.
What's gonna happen to you?

481
00:43:13,365 --> 00:43:16,451
You're 6' 2" with the brain
of an 11 -year-old.

482
00:43:17,536 --> 00:43:20,539
Maybe the ball-buster
had something to do with it?

483
00:43:20,956 --> 00:43:23,959
- What?
- This lady brought your jar back.

484
00:43:24,168 --> 00:43:28,339
- She said you had something of hers.
- The lady who called me Friday.

485
00:43:28,547 --> 00:43:32,468
- Of course. It belongs to her.
- She was really mad.

486
00:43:32,635 --> 00:43:36,764
- She wanted to bust your balls.
- There's not much to bust, kid.

487
00:43:37,765 --> 00:43:41,436
You'll have to go back to work
tomorrow. She's our only link.

488
00:43:48,068 --> 00:43:50,654
<i>- Yeah?
- Charlie, is that you?</i>

489
00:43:50,737 --> 00:43:54,867
- Oh, my God, it's your mother.
- Well, talk to her. You're me.

490
00:43:55,034 --> 00:43:57,161
<i>Hello? Charlie, you there?</i>

491
00:43:57,369 --> 00:44:01,374
Yo, Mom. How's it going?

492
00:44:01,457 --> 00:44:04,961
<i>Not too good. Cliff forgot
to fasten the mosquito net last night.</i>

493
00:44:05,169 --> 00:44:08,464
<i>- How are things with you and your dad?
- Different.</i>

494
00:44:08,548 --> 00:44:12,343
<i>Anyway, this is an expensive call.
You still my Charlie Bear?</i>

495
00:44:12,552 --> 00:44:17,474
<i>- Oh, come on, tell Mommy.
- I'm still your Charlie Bear. Good night.</i>

496
00:44:17,641 --> 00:44:20,560
I hate it when she pulls
that Charlie Bear stuff.

497
00:44:20,769 --> 00:44:23,939
She gets back this weekend.
If we don't resolve this...

498
00:44:24,148 --> 00:44:26,358
...l'll have to live with her again.

499
00:44:26,442 --> 00:44:29,445
This is the woman I couldn't live with
as a husband.

500
00:44:29,737 --> 00:44:31,447
And now I'm gonna be her son.

501
00:44:34,742 --> 00:44:37,245
It's a Freudian nightmare.

502
00:45:37,141 --> 00:45:39,060
- Good morning, Mr. Seymour.
- Yo.

503
00:45:39,268 --> 00:45:41,938
- Good morning, Marshall.
- Yo. Yo.

504
00:45:42,146 --> 00:45:45,859
- Yo, Marshall.
- Hi, Sam.

505
00:45:46,067 --> 00:45:49,863
The Jingle Bell Moose, Marshall.
We've been getting complaints.

506
00:45:50,572 --> 00:45:53,658
<i>- What's the problem?
- What's the problem?</i>

507
00:45:53,867 --> 00:45:56,453
Wow! It said what I said.

508
00:45:57,579 --> 00:46:00,457
It's supposed to do that.
You squeeze the antler.

509
00:46:00,666 --> 00:46:04,545
Some talk gibberish. A woman
in Kenilwon'th, hers swore in Polish.

510
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:07,757
Can I keep this one?

511
00:46:08,966 --> 00:46:13,346
- Well, yeah, sure. It's your call.
- Fine. Run with it, babe.

512
00:46:14,973 --> 00:46:20,353
I think they're trying to pass the buck,
Marshall. Or in this case, the moose.

513
00:46:21,479 --> 00:46:23,356
Moose.

514
00:46:31,365 --> 00:46:33,367
How are we today?

515
00:46:34,243 --> 00:46:35,953
Fine.

516
00:46:37,663 --> 00:46:41,375
Oh, Marcie, if that lady
who came here yesterday calls back...

517
00:46:41,542 --> 00:46:43,753
...I need to talk to her, okay?
- Okay.

518
00:46:43,961 --> 00:46:47,882
Your kid's school called to confirm
an appointment with his teacher.

519
00:46:48,967 --> 00:46:51,261
Right. Anything else?

520
00:46:51,469 --> 00:46:56,183
The janitor left a note to say
there's a frog in your bathroom.

521
00:46:56,266 --> 00:47:01,980
Oh, no. I forgot!
We need some flies or insects!

522
00:47:02,147 --> 00:47:03,982
He must be starving!

523
00:47:05,442 --> 00:47:08,946
Come on, come on.
I won't be able to do the science fair!

524
00:47:10,573 --> 00:47:14,243
Give it back! Give it back!
Come on. Please.

525
00:47:15,244 --> 00:47:17,372
- Come on, guys.
- What's going on here?

526
00:47:17,580 --> 00:47:20,458
- They've got my project.
- Great odds.

527
00:47:20,583 --> 00:47:23,253
It takes three of you
to harass this child.

528
00:47:23,461 --> 00:47:28,258
- Go screw yourself, ass-wipe.
- Oh, a prospective English major.

529
00:47:29,051 --> 00:47:32,971
Now, give the young lady her project
and we'll forget all about this.

530
00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:35,683
Hey, hey, come on.

531
00:47:35,849 --> 00:47:38,269
Give her her stuff back.

532
00:47:42,356 --> 00:47:44,066
Oh, man!

533
00:47:44,275 --> 00:47:47,945
- Oh, yeah! All right!
- You got his ass good.

534
00:47:49,447 --> 00:47:54,452
Name in the top, right-hand corner.
Let's try to make it legible, Corey.

535
00:47:54,661 --> 00:47:57,956
Melissa, this does not require
a discussion from you.

536
00:47:58,165 --> 00:48:01,084
Pencils down, people, test is over.

537
00:48:29,656 --> 00:48:33,160
Available in calfskin or alligator,
combination lock...

538
00:48:33,577 --> 00:48:38,957
...built-in digital timepiece and
a rather unique anti-personnel device.

539
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:42,586
For your type of skin, I would
recommend our facial scrub.

540
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:45,381
It's clinically formulated,
allergy-tested...

541
00:48:45,548 --> 00:48:48,384
As an extra, we offer
a concealed compartment...

542
00:48:48,467 --> 00:48:51,054
...to contain a poisonous gas
of your choice.

543
00:48:51,262 --> 00:48:53,765
Could I interest you
in an eye-contour gel?

544
00:48:56,267 --> 00:48:58,853
It works wonders.

545
00:49:02,566 --> 00:49:04,067
Yeah!

546
00:49:04,651 --> 00:49:06,570
- We have to talk.
- Wait.

547
00:49:06,653 --> 00:49:09,990
I'm about to beat
my all-time personal best.

548
00:49:14,870 --> 00:49:18,374
- You know what this is?
- I'm not a salesman, sir.

549
00:49:18,583 --> 00:49:22,253
- I'm an executive vice president.
- Yo, Marshall.

550
00:49:22,462 --> 00:49:24,380
Marshall.

551
00:49:24,672 --> 00:49:28,384
It's the moose again. Now we've got
two consumer groups on our backs.

552
00:49:28,551 --> 00:49:31,680
I say we tough it out.
What, you'll recall those mooses?

553
00:49:31,888 --> 00:49:34,057
Moose.
The plural for moose is "moose."

554
00:49:34,266 --> 00:49:38,353
- What, you're gonna say "gooses"?
- "Geese." You're saying it's "meese"?

555
00:49:38,562 --> 00:49:42,066
- I don't know what it is...
- Guys, could we can the semantics?

556
00:49:42,274 --> 00:49:45,152
I played with my moose
for 20 minutes and it broke.

557
00:49:46,570 --> 00:49:49,573
- So?
- So...

558
00:49:49,782 --> 00:49:53,369
...it's not fair.
Kid takes it home and it breaks.

559
00:49:53,578 --> 00:49:55,788
We've sold 100,000 of the suckers.

560
00:49:55,955 --> 00:49:59,083
Are you telling me
we just call them all in?

561
00:50:00,752 --> 00:50:02,587
Do it!

562
00:50:08,093 --> 00:50:10,762
Handguns are in Sporting Goods, sir.

563
00:50:35,163 --> 00:50:37,165
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

564
00:50:43,756 --> 00:50:45,883
What's going on?

565
00:51:04,569 --> 00:51:06,780
How did she get to become
a track coach?

566
00:51:06,988 --> 00:51:08,657
She makes me sick.

567
00:51:08,782 --> 00:51:12,578
Man, you just don't know.
She is so fat, man.

568
00:51:12,870 --> 00:51:15,664
Freeze!

569
00:51:15,873 --> 00:51:18,667
Calhoun, High School Patrol.

570
00:51:23,172 --> 00:51:25,758
Nice try, kid.

571
00:51:25,883 --> 00:51:30,388
Okay, spread! Up against the wall.
You too, tuna breath.

572
00:51:30,597 --> 00:51:33,767
- Look, I only took a drag.
- Did I say you could talk...

573
00:51:33,975 --> 00:51:35,685
...punk?

574
00:51:37,395 --> 00:51:42,359
Word on the street is you barf bags are
giving seventh-grade kids a hard time.

575
00:51:42,484 --> 00:51:45,988
- Hey, we were just smoking, man.
- I know what's going down!

576
00:51:49,074 --> 00:51:54,163
You don't wanna draw any heat,
you'll get off their case.

577
00:51:56,499 --> 00:51:59,085
- Yeah.
- Yeah, it's cool.

578
00:52:06,176 --> 00:52:09,888
Hey, butt-heads, come here.

579
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:13,558
I'm gonna be back in half an hour...

580
00:52:13,684 --> 00:52:18,397
...and those bowls
had better be gleaming.

581
00:52:40,170 --> 00:52:42,088
- Hi, Dad.
- What are you doing here?

582
00:52:42,297 --> 00:52:44,466
You never said you had
to see my teacher.

583
00:52:44,591 --> 00:52:47,678
You never told me
you had hockey practice!

584
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:53,976
Mr. Seymour.

585
00:52:54,602 --> 00:52:56,187
Hi.

586
00:52:56,395 --> 00:52:58,689
I'm Jane Luttrell.

587
00:52:58,773 --> 00:53:02,902
- Yes, I know.
- I'm happy we have this chance to talk.

588
00:53:03,069 --> 00:53:06,197
I have to be honest,
I'm concerned about Charlie.

589
00:53:06,489 --> 00:53:10,201
- I'm sure you'll agree, he's an enigma.
- A what?

590
00:53:10,785 --> 00:53:14,873
A puzzle. Well, I've already graded
yesterday's test papers.

591
00:53:15,082 --> 00:53:19,002
- How did he do?
- Exceptionally well.

592
00:53:19,169 --> 00:53:22,464
Which only confirms
what I have suspected all along.

593
00:53:22,673 --> 00:53:25,301
He's working far below his potential.

594
00:53:25,676 --> 00:53:30,389
He's too easily distracted.
He lacks focus. He lacks...

595
00:53:30,890 --> 00:53:32,266
...concentration.

596
00:53:35,103 --> 00:53:38,189
I'm trying to tell you,
your son is a dreamer.

597
00:53:38,398 --> 00:53:42,402
- All he thinks about is music.
- He likes music. And you know what?

598
00:53:42,569 --> 00:53:44,696
Maybe one day he'll be a big star.

599
00:53:44,905 --> 00:53:47,574
And you'll ask him to come back
and give prizes...

600
00:53:47,699 --> 00:53:50,494
...and maybe he won't
because you dumped on him!

601
00:53:52,371 --> 00:53:55,374
I'm the last person
to discourage outside interests.

602
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:59,003
I just wish I could have his attention
in my classroom.

603
00:53:59,170 --> 00:54:04,175
Well, maybe he finds your classes
totally boring.

604
00:54:04,967 --> 00:54:09,097
Well, it might be something else.

605
00:54:12,684 --> 00:54:14,686
Mr. Seymour...

606
00:54:15,979 --> 00:54:18,899
...this is a little embarrassing.

607
00:54:21,485 --> 00:54:26,407
Charlie may be getting to that age.

608
00:54:26,573 --> 00:54:30,494
Well, frankly,
I think he has a crush on me.

609
00:54:31,370 --> 00:54:33,873
No way!

610
00:54:44,968 --> 00:54:47,679
What do you girls think
you're doing? Move it!

611
00:54:47,888 --> 00:54:51,892
Get over here! How many times do
I have to tell you not to bury the puck?

612
00:54:52,100 --> 00:54:54,770
Move it! Move it!
You guys are terrible!

613
00:54:54,978 --> 00:54:58,482
I'm gonna send you back
to your mothers! You can't skate!

614
00:54:58,607 --> 00:55:01,068
Can someone tell me
what's going on here?!

615
00:55:01,277 --> 00:55:05,281
Am I in the wrong place? Are these
the auditions for the Ice Capades?

616
00:55:05,489 --> 00:55:08,993
In the locker room, in the classroom,
you guys may be buddies!

617
00:55:09,202 --> 00:55:11,996
Out here, all I want to see is hate!

618
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:14,499
The city pays this man
to shape young minds?

619
00:55:14,582 --> 00:55:18,795
You two, out!
Doug, Charlie, you're in.

620
00:55:19,004 --> 00:55:23,383
- Do you mind if I sit out this one?
- Do I what?

621
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:27,471
- Acid stomach.
- Get out there!

622
00:55:27,971 --> 00:55:30,683
Move it, Seymour! Hustle, buddy!

623
00:55:35,688 --> 00:55:38,191
What are you waiting for?

624
00:55:40,193 --> 00:55:42,070
Oh, no!

625
00:55:42,278 --> 00:55:43,988
Dad!

626
00:56:01,590 --> 00:56:04,885
What a spaz!

627
00:56:17,982 --> 00:56:21,111
Hope I didn't put in
too much vermouth.

628
00:56:23,196 --> 00:56:26,408
You really have
the worst of this deal, Dad.

629
00:56:26,783 --> 00:56:30,204
It's funny, I don't remember 11
being this tough.

630
00:56:32,498 --> 00:56:34,375
<i>1964.</i>

631
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:39,505
I played second base in Little League.
The Beatles were on the radio.

632
00:56:40,381 --> 00:56:45,011
- I saw my first James Bond film.
- James Bond was alive then?

633
00:56:45,178 --> 00:56:47,889
I'm not all that old.
I got married very young.

634
00:56:48,097 --> 00:56:50,684
Your mother and I
were still in college.

635
00:56:51,601 --> 00:56:54,187
We were a crazy couple of kids.

636
00:56:55,605 --> 00:56:57,607
Are you sorry?

637
00:56:57,691 --> 00:57:02,112
Of course not.
Otherwise, I wouldn't have had you.

638
00:57:02,279 --> 00:57:04,406
I'll get it, Dad.

639
00:57:07,576 --> 00:57:09,286
Hi, I'm Debbie.

640
00:57:09,495 --> 00:57:10,997
I'm your babysitter.

641
00:57:14,083 --> 00:57:17,587
I forgot. I arranged a sitter
because I was seeing Sam tonight.

642
00:57:17,795 --> 00:57:19,798
- I'll go.
- Out of the question.

643
00:57:20,006 --> 00:57:22,592
She's worried about your unit, Dad!

644
00:57:22,801 --> 00:57:27,097
If you stand her up tonight,
she may never, ever talk to you again.

645
00:57:27,305 --> 00:57:29,099
Ever.

646
00:57:36,607 --> 00:57:38,400
- Hi, Sam.
- Hi.

647
00:57:41,278 --> 00:57:44,907
- I don't wanna go to Antoine's tonight.
- Fine.

648
00:57:45,116 --> 00:57:47,702
Because I know what will happen
if we do.

649
00:57:48,286 --> 00:57:49,913
We'll have a wonderful meal.

650
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:52,582
I'll drink way too much wine...

651
00:57:52,791 --> 00:57:55,293
...and we'll end up in bed together.

652
00:57:56,002 --> 00:57:58,296
No, we won't.

653
00:57:58,505 --> 00:58:01,091
I'm serious, Marshall.
We need to talk.

654
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:05,012
Wouldrt you rather go to a concert?

655
00:58:08,390 --> 00:58:11,102
Did you get ahold of tickets
to Mahler's Second?

656
00:58:11,685 --> 00:58:15,106
No, it's not Mahler.

657
00:59:05,909 --> 00:59:07,202
These guys are radical!

658
00:59:36,817 --> 00:59:38,986
We want everybody...

659
00:59:39,194 --> 00:59:41,822
...to get their fists in the air!

660
00:59:45,493 --> 00:59:49,121
Let me hear you!

661
01:00:07,015 --> 01:00:10,394
I guess you felt bad about
not letting Charlie go to the concert.

662
01:00:11,895 --> 01:00:14,398
So you did the next best thing.

663
01:00:15,191 --> 01:00:19,195
You went to all this trouble
just to get him an autograph.

664
01:00:19,487 --> 01:00:22,114
That's really sweet, Marshall.

665
01:00:22,323 --> 01:00:25,785
<i>"To Charlie: Party till you puke.</i>

666
01:00:25,994 --> 01:00:28,621
Love, Malice."

667
01:00:29,789 --> 01:00:34,794
I think Charlie being around is having
a very positive effect on you, Marshall.

668
01:00:35,003 --> 01:00:39,007
I mean, tonight you completely
disarmed me.

669
01:00:41,301 --> 01:00:44,805
You showed me a person
I really wanna be with.

670
01:00:46,307 --> 01:00:49,810
I want to be with you tonight.

671
01:01:08,705 --> 01:01:11,208
There's some magazines over there.

672
01:01:12,793 --> 01:01:15,421
We could watch MTV.

673
01:01:16,213 --> 01:01:19,717
I think I've heard enough music
for one evening.

674
01:01:20,593 --> 01:01:22,595
Besides...

675
01:01:23,721 --> 01:01:26,390
...we don't wanna wake Charlie up.

676
01:01:28,226 --> 01:01:29,894
Why?

677
01:01:46,203 --> 01:01:49,498
I have to leave early.
I've got exercise class in the morning.

678
01:01:49,707 --> 01:01:52,001
I feel sick.

679
01:01:52,793 --> 01:01:54,295
Charlie.

680
01:01:54,921 --> 01:01:56,923
I thought you were still asleep.

681
01:01:57,006 --> 01:01:59,217
I'm too nauseous to sleep.

682
01:01:59,425 --> 01:02:01,511
I don't think he has a temperature.

683
01:02:02,095 --> 01:02:04,722
Why don't you get him a drink of water.

684
01:02:13,315 --> 01:02:16,902
Look what your Dad got for you.

685
01:02:20,614 --> 01:02:23,409
- He took you to this?
- Yeah.

686
01:02:23,909 --> 01:02:25,911
And you know something...

687
01:02:26,120 --> 01:02:29,123
...it was the most fun date
I've ever had with him.

688
01:02:29,207 --> 01:02:33,127
- You mean, you don't usually have fun?
- Sure.

689
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:39,509
It's just that your dad works so hard,
and sometimes he's not always there.

690
01:02:39,593 --> 01:02:43,930
- But you do like him?
- I wouldn't be here if I didn't.

691
01:02:44,014 --> 01:02:48,393
I don't just mean tonight. I mean
the big picture, the whole ball of wax.

692
01:02:48,602 --> 01:02:50,813
- Tap water okay?
- No, it isn't!

693
01:02:51,021 --> 01:02:53,023
There's Evian in the icebox.

694
01:03:03,826 --> 01:03:06,412
He really likes you, Sam.

695
01:03:06,996 --> 01:03:09,916
Not always good at saying...

696
01:03:14,004 --> 01:03:16,131
...but he loves you.

697
01:03:22,096 --> 01:03:23,806
You think so?

698
01:03:25,599 --> 01:03:27,601
I know so.

699
01:03:29,729 --> 01:03:33,107
You are really special, Charlie.

700
01:03:41,700 --> 01:03:43,702
Here's your Evian.

701
01:03:47,414 --> 01:03:50,501
- I think I should go.
- What do you think, Charlie?

702
01:03:50,709 --> 01:03:54,505
Absolutely. The forecast says snow.
The roads might get dangerous.

703
01:03:54,713 --> 01:03:57,716
You need your sleep.
You have a tough day tomorrow.

704
01:04:02,305 --> 01:04:04,807
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

705
01:04:05,933 --> 01:04:08,519
He's fine.

706
01:04:11,022 --> 01:04:13,733
Good night, my favorite men.

707
01:04:13,900 --> 01:04:16,319
Take care of each other.

708
01:04:17,738 --> 01:04:19,615
Good night.

709
01:04:24,119 --> 01:04:27,831
- Your first kiss, huh?
- I didn't mean to, Dad.

710
01:04:27,998 --> 01:04:29,834
I mean, I wasrt...

711
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:33,212
- She did it!
- It's okay.

712
01:04:33,421 --> 01:04:35,798
She obviously likes me.

713
01:04:36,132 --> 01:04:38,509
Now that you're me.

714
01:04:39,302 --> 01:04:41,638
What a night.

715
01:04:48,311 --> 01:04:50,314
Taxi!

716
01:04:53,108 --> 01:04:55,736
Okay, here we go.

717
01:05:00,699 --> 01:05:05,037
He's an angel of a man, but I'm telling
you, he has absolutely no taste.

718
01:05:05,204 --> 01:05:09,208
I tried to talk him out of it.
Turquoise drapes with a beige carpet.

719
01:05:09,709 --> 01:05:12,629
Beige, criminal.

720
01:05:13,505 --> 01:05:16,716
- Mr. Marshall Seymour, please.
- You just missed him.

721
01:05:17,217 --> 01:05:19,719
Why, that is so wicked of him.

722
01:05:19,928 --> 01:05:22,222
Lillian Brookmeyer,
his interior decorator.

723
01:05:22,431 --> 01:05:25,017
Could you be a dear
and let us in for a moment?

724
01:05:25,225 --> 01:05:27,436
We're only here to measure up.

725
01:05:34,110 --> 01:05:36,404
Do you know where
Professor Kerschner is?

726
01:05:36,612 --> 01:05:39,615
- Downstairs, in the basement.
- All right, thanks.

727
01:05:39,741 --> 01:05:41,409
Come on.

728
01:05:42,118 --> 01:05:44,329
Professor Kerschner?

729
01:05:44,621 --> 01:05:46,539
- Yes.
- Marshall Seymour.

730
01:05:46,706 --> 01:05:48,124
Marshall Seymour.

731
01:05:48,625 --> 01:05:50,210
It's not here.

732
01:05:50,335 --> 01:05:52,713
I'm not surprised.
You threaten the guy...

733
01:05:52,921 --> 01:05:55,632
...he gets freaked
and puts it somewhere safe.

734
01:05:56,717 --> 01:05:58,719
- What are you doing?
- Cleaning up.

735
01:05:58,802 --> 01:06:01,305
No use tipping him off
that we were here.

736
01:06:01,430 --> 01:06:04,809
How considerate.
At home, you never lift a finger.

737
01:06:05,017 --> 01:06:05,142
To the lamas, this symbolizes
the body's impermanence.

738
01:06:05,142 --> 01:06:07,812
To the lamas, this symbolizes
the body's impermanence.

739
01:06:08,020 --> 01:06:11,441
They view it as one of the many houses
inabited by the spirit...

740
01:06:11,607 --> 01:06:14,611
...in its ceaseless journey
of reincarnation.

741
01:06:16,029 --> 01:06:19,032
- Can I ask a question, professor?
- But of course.

742
01:06:19,115 --> 01:06:22,118
Oh, wait a second,
I have something for you.

743
01:06:24,621 --> 01:06:29,126
Did the lamas believe that the spirit
could change places without dying?

744
01:06:29,626 --> 01:06:32,838
It's called transmogrification.
There are such beliefs...

745
01:06:33,005 --> 01:06:36,926
...but they're all in the area
of superstition rather than science.

746
01:06:37,134 --> 01:06:40,304
- That's what you think.
- What my dad means...

747
01:06:40,513 --> 01:06:43,141
...is that we should keep
an open mind.

748
01:06:45,727 --> 01:06:48,021
- Can I keep this, please?
- No way!

749
01:06:48,229 --> 01:06:52,442
- He can't. We'll never see it again.
- Sit down!

750
01:06:57,823 --> 01:07:00,325
There is a man
that I'd love to show it to.

751
01:07:00,534 --> 01:07:02,911
He was a lama
before the Chinese invasion.

752
01:07:03,037 --> 01:07:05,539
- Where is he?
- Can we see him?

753
01:07:05,831 --> 01:07:08,417
I'll try to arrange it.

754
01:07:08,834 --> 01:07:10,711
May I keep it?

755
01:07:12,421 --> 01:07:15,133
Dad, did you see my tape deck?

756
01:07:15,633 --> 01:07:17,719
I thought I left it in there.

757
01:07:17,927 --> 01:07:22,223
Cleaning lady must have been here.
She doesn't usually do this good.

758
01:07:24,726 --> 01:07:26,645
You drink a lot, huh, Dad?

759
01:07:27,938 --> 01:07:32,234
Only under stress. I think the last
three days come under that category.

760
01:07:37,031 --> 01:07:42,245
Maybe this guru guy will deliver.
I mean, he is a genuine lama.

761
01:07:42,411 --> 01:07:46,708
He is an ex-lama. He's probably
one of those spaced-out weirdoes...

762
01:07:46,916 --> 01:07:51,546
...who sell you coloring books at the
airports and tell you life is a tulip.

763
01:07:51,713 --> 01:07:55,634
And can you believe our future
depends on this flake?

764
01:07:57,928 --> 01:08:00,722
Answer the door.
Go see who it is.

765
01:08:08,314 --> 01:08:09,440
What's wrong?

766
01:08:11,442 --> 01:08:14,237
- Nothing.
- The store said you were sick.

767
01:08:14,445 --> 01:08:17,240
I called the school,
they said Charlie's sick.

768
01:08:17,448 --> 01:08:19,951
You werert supposed to be back
until Saturday.

769
01:08:20,118 --> 01:08:23,747
Mosquitoes are one thing, but when
Hurricane Claire was coming...

770
01:08:23,913 --> 01:08:26,249
...I said, "Cliff, it's time to go home."

771
01:08:26,416 --> 01:08:29,127
Oh, shit! What are you doing here?

772
01:08:29,336 --> 01:08:32,214
Is that how you greet your mother?

773
01:08:33,715 --> 01:08:35,717
He's drinking.

774
01:08:37,011 --> 01:08:39,722
Marshall, he is drinking!

775
01:08:41,015 --> 01:08:43,142
You're home now, Charlie.

776
01:08:43,642 --> 01:08:48,022
You'll be in your own room tonight
with all your own things.

777
01:08:48,439 --> 01:08:50,441
I'm in the tub. Do you mind?

778
01:08:53,027 --> 01:08:55,822
Don't be mad at me, Charlie.
I'm not mad at you.

779
01:08:57,449 --> 01:09:00,118
Mom knows this is not your fault.

780
01:09:00,535 --> 01:09:04,540
Mom knows your father turned you
into a foul-mouthed alcoholic.

781
01:09:06,750 --> 01:09:10,713
<i>This is Marshall. I can't come to the
phone. Please leave a message. Bye.</i>

782
01:09:10,921 --> 01:09:16,218
<i>Marshall, it's imperative that we resolve
this South China Seas situation.</i>

783
01:09:16,344 --> 01:09:20,515
<i>I don't care if you're still sick.
The meeting's at 10.</i>

784
01:09:21,349 --> 01:09:22,725
Oh, boy.

785
01:09:23,852 --> 01:09:27,939
- What does he look like?
- All the little bastards look alike.

786
01:09:28,148 --> 01:09:30,817
I don't know.
Let's hope he's not sick today.

787
01:09:31,026 --> 01:09:33,653
Look at this.
That looks very familiar.

788
01:09:35,113 --> 01:09:37,241
- You got everything?
- Yeah.

789
01:09:37,449 --> 01:09:39,535
I'm making your
favorite supper tonight.

790
01:09:39,743 --> 01:09:42,830
- Rack of lamb?
- Tuna fish casserole.

791
01:09:43,038 --> 01:09:44,832
I can't wait.

792
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:47,126
Arert you forgetting something?

793
01:09:51,839 --> 01:09:55,051
- See you later, Charlie Bear.
- Yeah, bye.

794
01:09:56,344 --> 01:09:58,138
- Yes.
- Tell me, quick. Tell me.

795
01:09:58,346 --> 01:10:00,223
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

796
01:10:03,226 --> 01:10:05,145
- Don't kill the shit.
- I'll get him.

797
01:10:05,354 --> 01:10:06,855
- He's on your side.
- Christ!

798
01:10:07,022 --> 01:10:10,442
- He's on your side!
- Quick! Now what am I supposed to...?

799
01:10:14,154 --> 01:10:15,948
What are you doing in a limo?

800
01:10:17,116 --> 01:10:19,827
I don't believe it.
Someone beat us to it.

801
01:10:20,036 --> 01:10:21,746
Look out!

802
01:10:21,954 --> 01:10:24,248
Avery's pissed.
He's called a big meeting.

803
01:10:24,457 --> 01:10:26,334
Avery's called a big meeting?

804
01:10:26,417 --> 01:10:28,545
We're dead.

805
01:10:30,130 --> 01:10:32,257
Not yet, Dad.

806
01:10:32,757 --> 01:10:35,844
Microphone
and micro radio transmitter...

807
01:10:36,053 --> 01:10:40,140
...enabling control to monitor the
agent in the field's ongoing situation.

808
01:10:40,432 --> 01:10:43,227
Invaluable in drug busts, for example.

809
01:10:43,435 --> 01:10:45,729
How does the agent get his orders?

810
01:10:45,938 --> 01:10:48,149
This is a very popular method,
young man.

811
01:10:48,232 --> 01:10:51,444
An antenna concealed
in the arm of this eyeglass frame...

812
01:10:51,652 --> 01:10:54,822
...works in combination
with this miniature earpiece.

813
01:10:55,031 --> 01:10:56,658
It'll work.

814
01:10:58,451 --> 01:11:01,955
Shall I charge this to your account,
Mr. Seymour?

815
01:11:04,040 --> 01:11:06,460
- Yes.
- Fine.

816
01:11:41,538 --> 01:11:44,249
- I wish that shit had gone to school.
- Take it easy.

817
01:11:44,458 --> 01:11:46,627
- Maybe he's in the bathroom.
- All this time?

818
01:11:46,835 --> 01:11:48,921
Maybe he ate Mexican last night.

819
01:11:49,839 --> 01:11:52,842
Get in there. Do something!

820
01:11:56,637 --> 01:11:58,931
Hello? Hello?

821
01:11:59,057 --> 01:12:00,725
Are you receiving me? Over.

822
01:12:04,354 --> 01:12:08,358
This is Alpha One. Alpha One.
Dad, are you receiving me? Over.

823
01:12:08,525 --> 01:12:10,527
Oh, my God, it works.

824
01:12:11,153 --> 01:12:15,032
- Yeah. Are you receiving me?
- Pretty good. Say something else.

825
01:12:15,240 --> 01:12:17,826
- Am I loud enough?
- Great! That's it!

826
01:12:18,035 --> 01:12:19,453
Marshall?

827
01:12:20,663 --> 01:12:21,956
Are you okay?

828
01:12:22,957 --> 01:12:25,751
I called last night,
but I only got your machine.

829
01:12:25,960 --> 01:12:29,255
Robyn came back.
She took Charlie home.

830
01:12:29,338 --> 01:12:32,425
Well, we better go.
They're waiting for us.

831
01:12:36,054 --> 01:12:38,139
- Okay.
- The backstabbers have Avery...

832
01:12:38,348 --> 01:12:42,561
...ready to pull the plug, trash the
concept, cancel our orders, everything.

833
01:12:42,936 --> 01:12:46,565
You're the one who'll have
to turn this thing around, Marshall.

834
01:12:46,648 --> 01:12:50,027
- Life's too short for this crap.
- You go on in.

835
01:12:50,235 --> 01:12:52,446
I'll be in in a minute.

836
01:13:53,344 --> 01:13:57,932
I know you've given a lot
of commitment and energy to this idea.

837
01:13:58,140 --> 01:14:02,645
But you are asking the company
to invest a total of... How much, Brad?

838
01:14:03,646 --> 01:14:05,148
6.4 million, sir.

839
01:14:05,231 --> 01:14:08,651
- Yes, but that's over three years.
- That's over three years.

840
01:14:08,860 --> 01:14:11,946
We've been offered favorable
interest rates from Hong Kong.

841
01:14:12,155 --> 01:14:16,243
And we've been offered very favorable
interest rates from King Kong.

842
01:14:17,869 --> 01:14:20,747
- Hong Kong!
- I mean, from Hong Kong.

843
01:14:20,831 --> 01:14:24,335
Maybe. But what is the most
we have ever expended before...

844
01:14:24,543 --> 01:14:26,837
...for a single promotional concept?

845
01:14:28,255 --> 01:14:30,466
1.2 million.
"The Best of Britain Week."

846
01:14:30,633 --> 01:14:33,135
- Now, that made money.
- 1.2 million.

847
01:14:33,344 --> 01:14:35,763
"Best of Britain Week."
That made money.

848
01:14:35,930 --> 01:14:38,266
We would've made more
if we thought bigger.

849
01:14:38,433 --> 01:14:40,560
Would've made more
if we'd thought bigger.

850
01:14:40,769 --> 01:14:45,565
- This concept is far more imaginative.
- This concept is far more imaginative.

851
01:14:45,732 --> 01:14:48,860
We're taking in textiles,
ceramics, sportswear...

852
01:14:49,069 --> 01:14:52,030
...travel, rugs.

853
01:14:53,532 --> 01:14:56,368
It's the size of this thing
that make me nervous, sir.

854
01:14:56,535 --> 01:14:59,747
Yes. If the people of Bedford Park
find the Orient too exotic...

855
01:14:59,955 --> 01:15:01,666
...we'll end up with a warehouse...

856
01:15:01,832 --> 01:15:04,961
...full of kimonos and ginger jars.
- Asshole!

857
01:15:05,169 --> 01:15:06,838
<i>- Don't say that!
- I don't know.</i>

858
01:15:07,046 --> 01:15:11,259
There won't be room in the warehouse,
Larry. It'll be full of recalled moose?

859
01:15:11,551 --> 01:15:14,471
- What's this?
- Yeah, you never told me about this!

860
01:15:14,763 --> 01:15:17,432
- There wasrt time. Okay?
- Wasrt time for what?

861
01:15:21,561 --> 01:15:24,064
- To tell you about it, sir.
- Tell me what?

862
01:15:25,357 --> 01:15:28,235
Our purchase-with-purchase
Jingle Bell Moose, sir.

863
01:15:28,444 --> 01:15:33,240
A few of them were defective
and Marshall recalled 100,000.

864
01:15:35,868 --> 01:15:37,745
Were you deranged?

865
01:15:38,955 --> 01:15:43,835
Kids were getting ripped off. It just
seemed like the right thing to do.

866
01:15:45,170 --> 01:15:48,256
- Don't make a sound.
- There's no need for physical violence.

867
01:15:48,465 --> 01:15:51,551
- Don't make a sound.
- I won't. I'm not a moron.

868
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:57,057
Would I feel easier
if this high-flying China Seas concept...

869
01:15:57,266 --> 01:16:00,853
...were in the hands of someone
less impulsive?

870
01:16:08,069 --> 01:16:10,446
Would you like me
to clarify the question?

871
01:16:25,963 --> 01:16:28,048
Well, see...

872
01:16:29,341 --> 01:16:31,760
...I don't know how you feel.

873
01:16:33,262 --> 01:16:37,642
I only know that the man you're
looking at cares a lot about this job.

874
01:16:37,850 --> 01:16:40,061
He works real hard at it.

875
01:16:40,269 --> 01:16:44,148
He works on weekends,
he works at nights.

876
01:16:44,774 --> 01:16:48,653
Sometimes he doesn't even
get enough time to see his kid...

877
01:16:50,739 --> 01:16:53,158
...people he cares about.

878
01:16:53,867 --> 01:16:57,246
Now you say if his idea doesn't work,
he's gonna get fired?

879
01:16:58,664 --> 01:17:00,165
Well, that sucks!

880
01:17:01,875 --> 01:17:05,546
That's treating him
like some kind of yin-yang.

881
01:17:08,674 --> 01:17:11,344
Well, if it's a yin-yang you want
for this job...

882
01:17:11,469 --> 01:17:15,139
...you got three much better guys
to choose from.

883
01:17:28,654 --> 01:17:30,447
Dad?

884
01:17:38,664 --> 01:17:40,374
Dad!

885
01:17:45,463 --> 01:17:49,342
Now, I don't want you to get upset,
and I don't want you to panic.

886
01:17:49,551 --> 01:17:53,054
<i>- The thing is, I've been kidnapped.
- What do you mean, kidnapped?!</i>

887
01:17:53,346 --> 01:17:56,141
<i>- Where are you? Who did it?
- Stop that.</i>

888
01:17:56,349 --> 01:17:58,352
What did I just ask you not to do?

889
01:17:58,769 --> 01:18:03,565
Now, listen carefully and just make
a note of everything this person says.

890
01:18:07,278 --> 01:18:09,947
- Now, listen up.
- Have you done this before?

891
01:18:12,575 --> 01:18:14,452
I need the skull.

892
01:18:14,660 --> 01:18:15,953
- Mister...
- Seymour.

893
01:18:16,162 --> 01:18:18,873
- Seymour. It's not here.
- It's not here?

894
01:18:19,249 --> 01:18:21,376
I told you I wished
to show it to someone.

895
01:18:21,543 --> 01:18:24,879
Look, you don't know
how really intense this is.

896
01:18:27,466 --> 01:18:30,469
Not to worry,
I have his address here.

897
01:18:30,761 --> 01:18:32,971
Somewhere.

898
01:18:33,847 --> 01:18:35,974
Address, address, address...

899
01:19:17,059 --> 01:19:19,645
Come closer, young man.

900
01:19:25,860 --> 01:19:28,947
I need the skull, sir.
I'm totally desperate.

901
01:19:30,657 --> 01:19:33,785
Come. Sit down.

902
01:19:42,753 --> 01:19:44,755
Sorry.

903
01:19:51,054 --> 01:19:54,974
Look, if you're so desperate for money,
let me make you an offer.

904
01:19:55,183 --> 01:19:58,853
<i>I have a little set aside:
Savings, bonds, T-bills.</i>

905
01:19:58,979 --> 01:20:00,480
In your piggy bank?

906
01:20:00,647 --> 01:20:03,650
For God's sake, will you stop
treating me like a child.

907
01:20:03,859 --> 01:20:07,863
The skull made me a child.
It has magical powers.

908
01:20:08,071 --> 01:20:12,952
I am not me, and my father is not him.
My father is me, and I am my father.

909
01:20:13,160 --> 01:20:15,162
Yes, yes. And we are the world.

910
01:20:15,371 --> 01:20:17,873
Turkey or chicken salad?

911
01:20:19,959 --> 01:20:21,753
Okay.

912
01:20:23,171 --> 01:20:27,175
So how do I know you were
in the Oriental Palace in Bangkok?

913
01:20:27,675 --> 01:20:31,179
You took a Polaroid of me
and my girlfriend.

914
01:20:31,388 --> 01:20:35,183
You were wearing a cheap linen suit
with soy sauce on the lapel.

915
01:20:50,449 --> 01:20:52,869
Hey, get off the line, you pervert!

916
01:20:53,077 --> 01:20:55,788
It's me! I just made it.

917
01:20:56,581 --> 01:20:58,666
All right. Okay. Now...

918
01:20:58,875 --> 01:21:00,251
<i>... here's what you do.</i>

919
01:21:09,887 --> 01:21:14,391
There's been some very weird stuff
he's been telling me you should know.

920
01:21:14,767 --> 01:21:16,268
We should talk.

921
01:21:16,477 --> 01:21:19,772
Talk? You wanna talk now?

922
01:21:20,564 --> 01:21:23,067
He says he's a father.

923
01:21:25,570 --> 01:21:27,864
Horny little bastard.

924
01:21:39,668 --> 01:21:41,461
Dad!

925
01:21:48,260 --> 01:21:51,055
- You got it?
- Yeah.

926
01:21:53,474 --> 01:21:55,268
Wait! Where's my dad?

927
01:21:55,476 --> 01:21:57,061
- I got it!
- Are you sure?

928
01:21:58,771 --> 01:22:01,858
Dad! Dad, are you okay?

929
01:22:02,192 --> 01:22:03,693
Did you look? Did you check?

930
01:22:03,860 --> 01:22:07,489
Put me down! They're going
to the train station. We gotta go!

931
01:22:07,656 --> 01:22:11,868
<i>Let's go! I saw their tickets.
New York, 3:00, track 12.</i>

932
01:22:22,671 --> 01:22:26,759
- Taxi!
- Forget it. We've only got 12 minutes.

933
01:22:26,968 --> 01:22:29,387
- Officer! This old lady's being mugged!
- Where?

934
01:22:29,679 --> 01:22:32,682
- Up on the platform.
- Thanks, kid.

935
01:22:35,560 --> 01:22:38,688
- We can't!
- Charlie, we have no choice.

936
01:22:38,855 --> 01:22:41,692
- I can't drive it.
- I can.

937
01:22:45,779 --> 01:22:47,573
You better wear it, Dad.

938
01:22:50,993 --> 01:22:52,661
Dad!

939
01:22:53,662 --> 01:22:54,789
Dad!

940
01:22:57,792 --> 01:23:00,878
I'm telling you, the kid says
it has magical powers.

941
01:23:01,087 --> 01:23:03,965
I believe it.
It's going to make us rich.

942
01:23:12,182 --> 01:23:14,059
What the hell was that?

943
01:23:20,691 --> 01:23:24,361
Heading west on Harrison in pursuit
of a midget on one of our bikes.

944
01:23:27,490 --> 01:23:29,492
The same kind of trains here, okay?

945
01:23:29,659 --> 01:23:32,662
Don't worry about it.
Did you hear what the man said?

946
01:23:32,787 --> 01:23:36,499
- Look, "To all trains." What did I say?
- We're not gonna make it.

947
01:23:39,169 --> 01:23:40,587
Hang on!

948
01:23:47,177 --> 01:23:48,762
- You all right?
- Yeah.

949
01:24:09,576 --> 01:24:11,494
Where you going, Dad? Wrong way!

950
01:24:15,499 --> 01:24:17,501
Turn it, Dad! They're there!

951
01:24:36,771 --> 01:24:39,399
Calhoun, Chicago Vice!

952
01:24:40,191 --> 01:24:41,484
Way to go!

953
01:24:43,069 --> 01:24:44,779
All right!

954
01:24:48,992 --> 01:24:52,287
Dad, you're a totally intense dude.

955
01:24:52,871 --> 01:24:54,373
Thank you, Charlie.

956
01:24:54,498 --> 01:24:56,792
That's the nicest thing
you ever said to me.

957
01:25:00,963 --> 01:25:03,299
I couldn't. I feel sick.

958
01:25:09,389 --> 01:25:11,474
- Lf we'd have been caught...
- We werert.

959
01:25:11,683 --> 01:25:14,269
We'd be looking at 25 years.

960
01:25:14,477 --> 01:25:15,979
Life.

961
01:25:16,188 --> 01:25:19,691
Oh, boy. With this,
we can afford to go legit.

962
01:25:19,983 --> 01:25:22,194
Just as well,
your nerves are shot to shit.

963
01:25:22,277 --> 01:25:23,904
My whole digestive system.

964
01:25:24,196 --> 01:25:27,575
- It's me who's been taking all the risks.
- Excuse me?

965
01:25:29,201 --> 01:25:31,787
- Oh, sorry.
- Excuse me.

966
01:25:31,996 --> 01:25:33,497
Dad, knock.

967
01:25:33,664 --> 01:25:36,793
Think you got a rough deal
traveling around the East?

968
01:25:36,876 --> 01:25:39,087
Don't tell me
you don't have girls there.

969
01:25:39,796 --> 01:25:43,299
You'd trade all that for a New York
winter on 34th Street?

970
01:25:43,466 --> 01:25:45,593
New York? I wish!

971
01:25:52,976 --> 01:25:54,978
Sorry.

972
01:26:04,905 --> 01:26:06,574
I tried to warn you.

973
01:26:06,782 --> 01:26:08,701
Come on, let's go. Let's go!

974
01:26:08,868 --> 01:26:10,703
Run! Go!

975
01:26:30,099 --> 01:26:32,768
It happens to the best of families.

976
01:26:32,977 --> 01:26:34,979
Don't worry about it.

977
01:26:43,571 --> 01:26:46,491
Dad, what are we gonna do?

978
01:26:46,699 --> 01:26:50,370
If we tell them the truth,
we end up in straitjackets.

979
01:26:50,579 --> 01:26:54,791
We don't. We take the rap.
I have a great lawyer.

980
01:26:54,875 --> 01:26:57,294
Your defense is "executive burnout."

981
01:27:03,092 --> 01:27:05,594
Please, don't cry. Here.

982
01:27:05,803 --> 01:27:07,471
No.

983
01:27:08,389 --> 01:27:11,976
What about those people?
Those people that kidnapped you?

984
01:27:12,977 --> 01:27:14,270
Think about it.

985
01:27:16,105 --> 01:27:17,774
Oh, yeah.

986
01:27:17,982 --> 01:27:20,277
I guess they got theirs.

987
01:27:23,488 --> 01:27:24,781
Cliff!

988
01:27:30,287 --> 01:27:32,206
Hi, Marshall.

989
01:27:33,707 --> 01:27:36,710
You're lucky I was home
when they called the house.

990
01:27:37,002 --> 01:27:39,880
Listen, your mom
doesn't know anything about this.

991
01:27:40,089 --> 01:27:43,593
I told her I'd pick you up after school,
we went to see a movie.

992
01:27:43,676 --> 01:27:45,803
- Thanks, Cliff.
- Thanks, Cliff.

993
01:27:47,972 --> 01:27:50,475
Yeah, well...

994
01:27:50,809 --> 01:27:52,978
...I don't wanna give her
any more grief.

995
01:27:53,895 --> 01:27:55,772
Marshall, come here.

996
01:27:55,981 --> 01:27:58,984
Marshall, I don't know
what to say to you.

997
01:28:03,697 --> 01:28:05,491
Pull it together.

998
01:28:05,699 --> 01:28:08,911
I know you don't get a chance
to see much of your kid...

999
01:28:09,078 --> 01:28:11,414
...but I think today
maybe you overcompensated.

1000
01:28:11,581 --> 01:28:13,708
- Yes, Cliff.
- Yes, Cliff.

1001
01:28:14,292 --> 01:28:17,086
Anyway, you're free to go
on your own recognizance.

1002
01:28:17,211 --> 01:28:20,173
I know the captain.
He knocked the counts down to seven.

1003
01:28:20,381 --> 01:28:22,676
- Thanks a lot, Cliff.
- Thanks a lot, Cliff.

1004
01:28:25,011 --> 01:28:28,181
Yeah. Let's go home.

1005
01:28:32,686 --> 01:28:35,397
Oh, you better take that.

1006
01:28:42,613 --> 01:28:44,115
Sam!

1007
01:28:44,282 --> 01:28:45,700
I got your message, Marshall.

1008
01:28:45,908 --> 01:28:48,411
What happened to you?
Where have you been?

1009
01:28:49,412 --> 01:28:51,498
I had to do some stuff.

1010
01:28:58,004 --> 01:29:01,091
What happened at the meeting
after I left?

1011
01:29:03,385 --> 01:29:08,015
Well, I'll have to tell you, it was a little
tense in there for about 30 seconds.

1012
01:29:09,808 --> 01:29:12,687
<i>Finally, Avery says:</i>

1013
01:29:13,187 --> 01:29:15,314
"Unless the yin-yangs
have objections...

1014
01:29:15,481 --> 01:29:18,901
...I think we should let Marshall
run with this sucker."

1015
01:29:19,402 --> 01:29:21,905
Does that mean I still have a job?

1016
01:29:25,700 --> 01:29:28,286
That's great, Sam.

1017
01:29:30,705 --> 01:29:32,582
Let's celebrate.

1018
01:29:32,916 --> 01:29:36,378
No! There's something you
gotta do for me, Sam.

1019
01:29:37,087 --> 01:29:39,089
Take me over to Charlie's real quick.

1020
01:29:39,298 --> 01:29:41,801
- Why?
- I got a Christmas present for him.

1021
01:29:42,009 --> 01:29:44,804
You and Charlie have gotten
much closer, haven't you?

1022
01:29:47,390 --> 01:29:49,684
We need each other.

1023
01:29:52,687 --> 01:29:55,815
Marshall, you do know
I'm going home for Christmas.

1024
01:29:55,982 --> 01:29:57,817
Do you want to come?

1025
01:29:58,193 --> 01:30:00,779
The apartment's gonna
seem pretty lonely.

1026
01:30:00,987 --> 01:30:05,784
- Especially with Charlie gone.
- Yeah, it's real lonely.

1027
01:30:06,994 --> 01:30:08,787
I've been thinking about that.

1028
01:30:09,788 --> 01:30:14,001
I don't think it's right
for a man of his...

1029
01:30:14,585 --> 01:30:16,879
This age to be on his own.

1030
01:30:18,005 --> 01:30:20,591
Great. We can leave a day early.

1031
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:23,011
No, I didn't mean...

1032
01:30:23,094 --> 01:30:26,097
I wasrt just talking
about the holidays.

1033
01:30:26,681 --> 01:30:29,309
I was thinking about all the time.

1034
01:30:34,481 --> 01:30:36,191
I mean...

1035
01:30:36,984 --> 01:30:39,820
Well, like...

1036
01:30:41,488 --> 01:30:43,616
Will you marry me?

1037
01:31:17,818 --> 01:31:19,403
Merry Christmas.

1038
01:31:21,989 --> 01:31:24,784
Okay, here's what we do.

1039
01:31:24,992 --> 01:31:28,413
The lama said when we wish,
we both have to be touching it.

1040
01:31:28,496 --> 01:31:31,916
- That's why it worked the first time.
- Right.

1041
01:31:32,208 --> 01:31:35,003
Get undressed, Dad.
You'll rip my pajamas.

1042
01:31:36,088 --> 01:31:37,422
Hit the lights.

1043
01:31:42,219 --> 01:31:44,221
Charlie, you okay?

1044
01:32:22,011 --> 01:32:23,804
It worked.

1045
01:32:24,222 --> 01:32:28,309
- Oh, my God.
- All right, Dad. All right.

1046
01:32:32,814 --> 01:32:34,816
What movie did you take him to?

1047
01:32:35,025 --> 01:32:37,027
Get some sleep.

1048
01:32:43,408 --> 01:32:45,327
What am I gonna do with that thing?

1049
01:32:45,494 --> 01:32:49,415
When you get back to Thailand,
you can find out who it belongs to.

1050
01:32:50,916 --> 01:32:53,002
Avery gave you a "go."

1051
01:32:54,795 --> 01:32:57,423
He wants you and Sam back there
after New Year's.

1052
01:32:59,592 --> 01:33:01,511
Awesome.

1053
01:33:16,819 --> 01:33:21,490
I want Mo to know
he'll always be welcome at my place.

1054
01:33:21,615 --> 01:33:24,827
And we'll be seeing
a lot more of you, right?

1055
01:33:25,494 --> 01:33:26,996
Yeah.

1056
01:33:34,712 --> 01:33:38,216
Boy, it sure feels good
to be 11 again.

1057
01:33:40,427 --> 01:33:42,220
And you must be glad to be...

1058
01:33:42,596 --> 01:33:45,015
How old are you, Dad?

1059
01:33:48,018 --> 01:33:50,604
Younger than I used to be, kid.

1060
01:34:19,802 --> 01:34:22,096
It's good to see you, Sam.

1061
01:34:24,306 --> 01:34:25,933
Did you tell him?

1062
01:34:26,100 --> 01:34:30,021
- Tell him what?
- That I said "yes."

1063
01:34:30,396 --> 01:34:31,731
Yes to what?

1064
01:34:32,023 --> 01:34:35,193
<i>You can't have forgotten.
It was Just 20 minutes ago.</i>

1065
01:34:35,401 --> 01:34:36,903
<i>You proposed to me.</i>

1066
01:34:39,614 --> 01:34:42,409
And you said "yes."

1067
01:34:46,705 --> 01:34:49,333
Sure, I told him.

1068
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:53,128
He's almost as thrilled
about it as I am.
