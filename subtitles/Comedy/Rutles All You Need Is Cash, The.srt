1
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:04,560
British Airways flight 297 from London
now arriving at gate 12.

2
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:10,960
Hi.

3
00:02:13,435 --> 00:02:16,525
Rooms are at 39 bucks
day rate, 29 bucks overnight.

4
00:02:17,905 --> 00:02:20,270
- Well, it's cheaper to stay overnight.
- Damn right!

5
00:02:20,605 --> 00:02:23,270
Days are for sex.
Sex costs money.

6
00:02:23,445 --> 00:02:27,275
- Want a room or not?
- Yes for a week, please.

7
00:02:27,615 --> 00:02:30,605
That will be 203 bucks in advance.

8
00:02:41,425 --> 00:02:43,655
It will be unit 13.

9
00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:47,665
Check-out at noon
Thursday night.

10
00:02:53,405 --> 00:02:55,270
No, I'm fine.
Thank you.

11
00:04:13,255 --> 00:04:15,685
What's up, man!
Come here!

12
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:33,497
Open Gate 6!

13
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:43,942
- Are you alright?
- Yeah.

14
00:04:45,351 --> 00:04:46,841
Glad you could make it, bro.

15
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:51,350
What the fuck did you go to Chicago, anyway?
Are there not trade back home?

16
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:55,086
Their expensive lake views
and corn fed American pussies, why ask?

17
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:58,492
Jesus. Are you on the streets
long enough again?

18
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:05,764
Okay I'm here, Reese.
You said you make it worth my while.

19
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,065
Listen.

20
00:05:09,008 --> 00:05:12,637
Somebody is a dog track.
And they think it was me.

21
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:14,838
- But you are innocent.
- Of course I am.

22
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:16,709
The bad guys wore masks.

23
00:05:16,849 --> 00:05:20,512
Plus, one of them got
accidentally killed by the cops.

24
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:25,689
The car is getting north bound
in Lower Wacker  and Van Buren.

25
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,154
I see it.

26
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:34,326
- Goddamnit!
- Shut fuck up.

27
00:05:47,447 --> 00:05:49,005
What the fuck happened, Reese?

28
00:05:49,115 --> 00:05:52,016
Fucking crooked cops getting on duty!
That's what fucking happened.

29
00:05:52,452 --> 00:05:53,612
Bastards!

30
00:06:09,235 --> 00:06:10,133
Get out!

31
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:11,135
Get out!

32
00:06:11,637 --> 00:06:12,831
Get the fuck out!

33
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,537
He's got a gun!
He's got a gun!

34
00:06:15,742 --> 00:06:16,709
Drop the gun!

35
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,980
You in the truck,
let me see your hands!

36
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:27,683
Put them up!
Let me see your hands!

37
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:48,062
Get in the car.

38
00:06:49,108 --> 00:06:51,975
No witnesses, no money,
no conviction, right?

39
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:53,945
How much did they get?

40
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:57,574
- These bad guys?
- At least half a million.

41
00:06:57,717 --> 00:06:58,615
Maybe more.

42
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:01,014
Okay, I'm interested.

43
00:07:01,954 --> 00:07:02,886
Where?

44
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:06,080
I had to toss it.

45
00:07:06,392 --> 00:07:08,451
- Where?
- Dan Ryan expressway.

46
00:07:13,232 --> 00:07:14,290
Asshole!

47
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:17,262
Reese, what the fuck are you doing?
Our money!

48
00:07:17,403 --> 00:07:18,335
Shut the fuck up, will you?

49
00:07:18,971 --> 00:07:20,131
Do you think it's still there?

50
00:07:21,974 --> 00:07:23,339
- It's not there.
- Then where is it?

51
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,775
Well, it landed on this guy's car,
you know. A white-do.

52
00:07:26,045 --> 00:07:28,707
- Okay, what kind of car?
- An old car.

53
00:07:28,881 --> 00:07:32,317
Old station wagon.
Wood on the sides, you know?

54
00:07:32,985 --> 00:07:34,145
Yeah, wood on the sides.

55
00:07:48,701 --> 00:07:50,430
Shit!
Fucking piss!

56
00:07:51,204 --> 00:07:52,535
Son of a bitch!

57
00:07:54,574 --> 00:07:55,506
Why me?

58
00:07:55,741 --> 00:08:01,509
Ten zillion fucking cars in goddamn
Chicago and this motherfucker ass...

59
00:08:26,739 --> 00:08:27,797
Jesus Christ.

60
00:08:39,952 --> 00:08:41,510
You want to shower first?

61
00:08:43,222 --> 00:08:44,450
No, you go ahead.

62
00:08:45,725 --> 00:08:46,692
Okay.

63
00:09:06,913 --> 00:09:09,404
Don't be down, Sam.
It will all work out.

64
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:12,650
You want me to pick you up at work?

65
00:09:12,985 --> 00:09:15,954
No, I'll meet with you.
The walk will do me good.

66
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:52,814
- See you later, then?
- Yeah.

67
00:10:05,838 --> 00:10:06,770
Damn!

68
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:10,440
What the hell are you doing, man?

69
00:10:10,676 --> 00:10:12,906
Jesus Christ, Reese!
Are you fucking crazy?

70
00:10:13,045 --> 00:10:14,444
Fucking keep it down!

71
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,074
In Chicago, Reese.

72
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:23,945
The car capital of the northern USA
and you expect me to find one fucking car.

73
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:26,820
- Forget it, your boy got lucky.
- Listen to me.

74
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:30,417
This barney came into his
lock only two days ago.

75
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:33,054
The trail is still hot to
the street or snatch.

76
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:37,827
He'll use cash and that's what set him
apart from the other worker and folks.

77
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:41,471
First thing he'll do is buy
a new car , cash...

78
00:10:41,607 --> 00:10:42,801
and that's how you get him.

79
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:46,641
Now split is 50-50.
Are you in or out?

80
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:49,778
I'm here, aren't I?

81
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:52,943
I'll give my best shot.

82
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,865
- You're the sales manager?
- Yeah, that's me.

83
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:24,207
Can you help me?

84
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:29,451
I'm sure as hell try.

85
00:11:33,225 --> 00:11:36,319
If somebody comes in here
and buys a car for cash...

86
00:11:37,396 --> 00:11:38,385
what do you do?

87
00:11:38,764 --> 00:11:40,231
Cream in my calvins.

88
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:46,237
What official things do you do?

89
00:11:46,806 --> 00:11:51,072
Well, since there is no bank,
there's no loan application,

90
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:55,579
no insurance, papers to fill out
and no loan officer, see.

91
00:11:55,915 --> 00:11:58,349
But the only thing we
do on a cash deal...

92
00:11:58,751 --> 00:12:01,219
is to document the state tax
and licensing.

93
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,049
- How?
- It's a form.

94
00:12:03,422 --> 00:12:04,354
Here.

95
00:12:04,757 --> 00:12:07,191
But I gotta tell you
cash is rare.

96
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:10,524
Once, maybe two times a year
do I see a cash deal.

97
00:12:10,663 --> 00:12:12,563
Is this document
method of payment?

98
00:12:12,698 --> 00:12:14,131
Right there on that line, see?

99
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:16,633
You have to list the bank,
the finance company ...

100
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:19,403
or you stamp it "cash".

101
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:23,903
- And where do this go?
- Chicago DMB, Central Branch.

102
00:12:31,016 --> 00:12:32,074
Thank, buddy.

103
00:12:32,151 --> 00:12:35,348
Hey, you're welcome.
You rude fucking gumba.

104
00:12:37,957 --> 00:12:40,425
I can't imagine why he's late,
Mr. Dale.

105
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:42,026
He knew we're meeting
at 10:30.

106
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:45,597
I believe this is the very nature
of our problem, Ms. Phelan.

107
00:12:45,731 --> 00:12:47,926
Buying a house
is a major responsibility.

108
00:12:48,033 --> 00:12:52,060
I do not think Mr. Phelan is facing his
commitment in a responsible manner.

109
00:12:52,671 --> 00:12:56,198
You and your husband are 120
days behind in payments.

110
00:12:56,342 --> 00:13:01,211
This constitutes serious careers
to an institution of this small size.

111
00:13:01,347 --> 00:13:05,647
Mr. Dale, we know where we stand.
We've been unemployed.

112
00:13:06,051 --> 00:13:07,985
We're both working now,
we'll catch up.

113
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:11,556
You're asking much of this institution
to reschedule your loan...

114
00:13:12,091 --> 00:13:14,889
especially in view of
Mr. Phelan's tardiness...

115
00:13:15,094 --> 00:13:17,927
both in legal payments
and today's appointment.

116
00:13:18,731 --> 00:13:20,665
- Where have you been?
- I'll tell later.

117
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:24,069
Mr. Dale, our banker.
Let me guess.

118
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:26,268
You being the weany that you are,
you're not gonna

119
00:13:26,269 --> 00:13:28,333
reschedule our payments.
Is that right?

120
00:13:29,942 --> 00:13:31,034
What?

121
00:13:31,277 --> 00:13:32,403
What did you say?

122
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:38,942
Under the circumstances,
I do not believe this institution ...

123
00:13:39,018 --> 00:13:41,145
can accommodate you,
Mr. and Mrs. Phelan.

124
00:13:41,253 --> 00:13:43,448
Stop, Sam, talk to him.
This is our house!

125
00:13:43,556 --> 00:13:45,786
I'm afraid you have to pay
the full amount you owe

126
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:48,725
or Midwest Savings and Loan
will be force to finalize foreclosure proceedings.

127
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:51,854
Mr. Dale, please.
We have paid on that house...

128
00:13:51,931 --> 00:13:55,025
every month on time for 5 years.
Doesn't that count for anything?

129
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:57,397
What exactly is the full amount?

130
00:13:57,536 --> 00:14:02,269
With penalties and interest,
comes to $7603.12.

131
00:14:02,408 --> 00:14:03,340
Okay.

132
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:06,276
Here.

133
00:14:06,445 --> 00:14:12,179
1 thousand, 2 thousand, 3 thousand,
4 thousand, 5 thousand, 6 thousand, 7 thousand ...

134
00:14:12,818 --> 00:14:13,750
and...

135
00:14:15,754 --> 00:14:17,415
- One, two, three ...
- 12 cents.

136
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:19,319
Four, five, six.

137
00:14:19,892 --> 00:14:21,484
You got four singles?

138
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:23,960
Four.

139
00:14:24,296 --> 00:14:25,228
Yeah.

140
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,132
Thank you.

141
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:32,398
U.S. $ 7605.

142
00:14:32,838 --> 00:14:34,430
Leslie, come on.

143
00:14:38,244 --> 00:14:39,370
Wait, my sweater.

144
00:14:43,015 --> 00:14:47,645
You owe me $1.88, bastard
and want it by noon tomorrow.

145
00:14:58,063 --> 00:15:01,089
- Where did you get it ?
- Straight from heaven, baby.

146
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:03,529
No, really, Sam, where?

147
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,902
I was on the Dan Ryan
expressway, right.

148
00:15:07,006 --> 00:15:10,669
And a police chase went by,
and it just crashed onto the hood of my car.

149
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,208
Did it dent the car?

150
00:15:13,545 --> 00:15:15,911
Dented? Jesus, honey, forget that.
Come on.

151
00:15:17,516 --> 00:15:19,074
Oh my God.
How much is there?

152
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:20,275
I don't know.

153
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:21,746
You wanna find out?

154
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:17,602
How much, how much?

155
00:16:18,243 --> 00:16:19,232
Okay.

156
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:25,246
It comes to $618,127.

157
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:32,519
Wait, plus $7605 we give
that asshole Mr. Dale which makes...

158
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:35,259
- Did you see his face?
- Yeah.

159
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:37,985
I thought he was gonna pee in
his pants when you call him a weany.

160
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:40,597
How's it about when you
hit him up with $1.88?

161
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:41,722
- Bastard!
- Bastard!

162
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:44,661
Okay.

163
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:51,109
Counting the $7605
we gave the bank totals...

164
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:58,207
$625,731.

165
00:17:00,085 --> 00:17:01,347
My God!

166
00:17:03,555 --> 00:17:04,715
We're rich.

167
00:17:05,824 --> 00:17:07,587
Sam, we can't keep it.

168
00:17:08,093 --> 00:17:12,223
- Yes we can.
- No. It's probably dirty money.

169
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:13,626
Yeah, of course it is.
It's cash.

170
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:16,098
I don't want some Colombian drug
lord kicking our door down.

171
00:17:16,268 --> 00:17:18,168
Hey, nobody saw it, Les.

172
00:17:18,237 --> 00:17:21,604
If I hadn't picked it up, it would've just
laid on the ground for somebody else to find.

173
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:24,868
It's free and clear money.
Nobody in this world knows we have it.

174
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:27,679
What it was robbed
from a bank or something?

175
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,475
So what?
Banks are insured.

176
00:17:32,951 --> 00:17:34,111
Come on!

177
00:17:34,753 --> 00:17:35,913
What are we gonna do?

178
00:17:35,988 --> 00:17:40,448
You wanna play John Q dipshit
citizen and turn it over to Chicago PD?

179
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,585
Those crooks in blue, you know,
they'll just steal it for themselves anyway.

180
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:46,957
No, no, baby, no way.
This is our money.

181
00:17:47,132 --> 00:17:49,396
Alright?
God sent it to me right out of the sky.

182
00:17:49,468 --> 00:17:52,733
A million car hoods
in Chicago, this suitcase hit mine.

183
00:17:53,605 --> 00:17:54,799
That's fate.

184
00:17:58,444 --> 00:18:01,641
- They would be insured, right?
- Yeah, of course, they would.

185
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:05,815
Come on, this is our money, baby.
The mortgage is paid up.

186
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,848
You can have all the
stuff, you can finally buy.

187
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:10,750
New furniture, paint the house.

188
00:18:11,824 --> 00:18:12,916
Well ..

189
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:17,191
Leslie, over $600,000.
Allows us to spend anything we want.

190
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:19,230
All our dreams come true, baby.

191
00:18:20,065 --> 00:18:21,225
You're right!

192
00:18:22,134 --> 00:18:23,192
My God!

193
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:27,734
- What first?
- Well, there's a pretty big dent in the car.

194
00:18:27,873 --> 00:18:29,363
- New car!
- Yeah.

195
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:52,589
What will it be, man?

196
00:18:53,932 --> 00:18:55,194
I'm looking for Zeke.

197
00:18:56,502 --> 00:18:58,800
Wrong joint.
No Zeke here.

198
00:19:00,739 --> 00:19:01,763
Come here.

199
00:19:06,512 --> 00:19:07,536
Come here.

200
00:19:14,286 --> 00:19:15,275
Back there.

201
00:19:16,255 --> 00:19:17,279
Thanks.

202
00:20:02,134 --> 00:20:04,625
I was told I could buy tools.

203
00:20:04,736 --> 00:20:06,636
I've got tools.

204
00:20:07,806 --> 00:20:09,671
What's your preference?

205
00:20:10,175 --> 00:20:12,700
Sears? Stanley?
Snap On?

206
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:17,849
I was thinking more on the lines of Ruger,
Smith & Wesson, you know?

207
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:41,031
Can I get me keys to the
Motor Vehicle Department?

208
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:23,304
That's two chairs,
dining room set...

209
00:21:23,382 --> 00:21:26,249
sofa, big screen plasma TV.

210
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:28,247
What about a bed?

211
00:21:29,388 --> 00:21:30,514
What about a bed?

212
00:21:30,656 --> 00:21:31,953
Bed, bed, bed ...

213
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:33,819
We definitely got to
have a bed, don't we?

214
00:21:33,925 --> 00:21:35,859
Definitely.
Right this way.

215
00:21:44,436 --> 00:21:45,733
This is perfect.

216
00:21:56,882 --> 00:21:58,315
- Hi.
- Hey!

217
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:04,216
Okay, they'll deliver our stuff
tomorrow between 1 and 4.

218
00:22:04,289 --> 00:22:05,221
Alright.

219
00:22:06,058 --> 00:22:07,025
Give me that.

220
00:22:09,594 --> 00:22:11,289
Very swanky.

221
00:23:33,645 --> 00:23:34,976
Buick.

222
00:23:38,183 --> 00:23:39,480
Kia, maybe.

223
00:24:17,055 --> 00:24:18,283
Can I help you?

224
00:24:20,392 --> 00:24:22,257
Yes, excuse me.
Is that your Toyota?

225
00:24:22,494 --> 00:24:23,984
No, it's my wife's.
Why?

226
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:27,155
- Who is it Glenn?
- I don't know who the hell he is. Who the hell are you?

227
00:24:28,266 --> 00:24:29,426
Excuse me.

228
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:31,727
Hey motherfucker!

229
00:24:32,404 --> 00:24:34,304
What? You're driving around
you see a nice car...

230
00:24:34,372 --> 00:24:37,000
- you wanna get in my face
and ask me one question?
- What?

231
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:39,372
It looked like to me
your casing the joint.

232
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:40,410
Get him, baby.

233
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:42,162
You better get the fuck out of this
neighborhood before I bust

234
00:24:42,163 --> 00:24:43,846
a cop in your white boy ass.

235
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:45,973
Coz you don't want this.
He don't want this.

236
00:24:46,051 --> 00:24:47,814
- He don't want this.
-  No, he don't want this.

237
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,118
Listen up,
Glenn the fucking plumber.

238
00:24:51,523 --> 00:24:54,515
You blacks think y'all
so fucking bad.

239
00:24:54,726 --> 00:24:56,193
Well, you aren't.

240
00:24:56,428 --> 00:24:58,623
You think all white
people fear you.

241
00:24:58,797 --> 00:24:59,821
We don't.

242
00:24:59,965 --> 00:25:01,796
Now shut your fucking mouth...

243
00:25:03,068 --> 00:25:05,263
or I'll put you in the
fucking emergency ward.

244
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:06,502
Got it?

245
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,342
Did you hear that accent?

246
00:25:16,615 --> 00:25:18,207
Yeah, ain't no regular white boy.

247
00:25:18,283 --> 00:25:20,148
- Come on, let's just go.
- Is he Spanish?

248
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:48,311
Hi.

249
00:25:52,083 --> 00:25:56,611
Mr. Bearshit Tenderfeet?

250
00:25:56,788 --> 00:26:02,818
No, no, no. Pronounce this way please ...
Bahadurjit Tejinderpreet.

251
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:05,552
I can helped you, please.

252
00:26:05,697 --> 00:26:07,324
Yeah, helped me.

253
00:26:09,634 --> 00:26:10,931
Nice Chevy over there.

254
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:15,563
Oh yeah, my Chevrolet.
Great American automobile.

255
00:26:15,707 --> 00:26:18,733
I like it too much.
Chevrolet.

256
00:26:18,877 --> 00:26:20,640
Big favorite for you, Arabs,
is it?

257
00:26:21,146 --> 00:26:22,078
Arab?

258
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:24,875
That's bullshit!
I'm Sikh from India!

259
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:30,317
I don't make no 9/11.
I make 9/9! My beautiful store!

260
00:26:58,083 --> 00:27:00,051
Mr. Melvin Goldberg?

261
00:27:01,386 --> 00:27:02,717
Who wants to know?

262
00:27:02,887 --> 00:27:05,617
- I'm from Bavarian Motor Works.
- The what?

263
00:27:05,757 --> 00:27:08,658
BMW.
Bavarian Motor Works.

264
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:11,485
Your new car there.

265
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:12,763
Yeah, well.

266
00:27:13,698 --> 00:27:14,687
So?

267
00:27:14,866 --> 00:27:17,198
I'd like to ask you a couple
of questions, if you don't mind...

268
00:27:17,268 --> 00:27:20,396
- About your new Beemer.
- No, thanks. Beat it.

269
00:27:21,673 --> 00:27:26,133
My company is offering $100
for a simple 5-minute interview.

270
00:27:29,748 --> 00:27:30,737
Yeah.

271
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:32,383
Come inside.

272
00:27:45,296 --> 00:27:46,228
Yes!

273
00:27:50,468 --> 00:27:51,400
So ...

274
00:27:53,104 --> 00:27:54,469
How long have you had the car?

275
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:56,507
Eight days.

276
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:02,844
Do you like the BMW?

277
00:28:02,947 --> 00:28:04,881
Hell, yes.
Don't everybody?

278
00:28:05,083 --> 00:28:09,315
Even those goddamn Mercedes
fools are changing to BMW now.

279
00:28:11,656 --> 00:28:14,216
Aren't you gonna write stuff down?

280
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:16,156
I've got a good memory.

281
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:21,355
How long, did you say,
you finance the car?

282
00:28:21,833 --> 00:28:23,164
I didn't say.

283
00:28:24,436 --> 00:28:26,028
Why the hell do you
wanna know that anyhow?

284
00:28:26,671 --> 00:28:31,301
Just helps us to determine
buying trends and sort them out.

285
00:28:37,816 --> 00:28:38,805
24 months.

286
00:29:07,312 --> 00:29:09,007
It says you paid cash.

287
00:29:09,147 --> 00:29:10,239
Exit!

288
00:29:10,448 --> 00:29:11,346
Who the hell are you?

289
00:29:11,516 --> 00:29:13,416
Get the fuck out of my house!

290
00:29:21,326 --> 00:29:22,258
Sit down.

291
00:29:22,527 --> 00:29:24,461
Fuck you!

292
00:29:24,896 --> 00:29:27,387
Get the hell out
Or I'll throw your ass out.

293
00:30:03,234 --> 00:30:06,567
The suitcase?
Where is the suitcase, Goldberg?

294
00:30:08,339 --> 00:30:10,534
The money.
Where the fuck is it?

295
00:30:14,112 --> 00:30:15,545
I'm sorry, mister.

296
00:30:17,115 --> 00:30:19,310
I'll replace the cash, I promise.

297
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:20,913
So, it was you?

298
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:23,978
- Yeah?
- I did it.

299
00:30:24,756 --> 00:30:26,690
But I'll put it back, honest to God.

300
00:30:26,791 --> 00:30:29,988
What do you mean? You spent it all.
You spent half a million?

301
00:30:30,461 --> 00:30:31,393
What?

302
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:34,294
- No, no ...
- Talk to me Jew motherfucker.

303
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,868
I work for Gen-Am.

304
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:41,233
I stole the money.
I admit it.

305
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,931
But I did, because they
are extorting the customers.

306
00:30:45,043 --> 00:30:48,035
They're rip offs man.
They're chaining the public.

307
00:30:49,981 --> 00:30:52,279
I'll pay it back though, honest.

308
00:30:58,089 --> 00:30:59,556
Was your old car a station wagon?

309
00:30:59,657 --> 00:31:02,319
No way!
You a cop?

310
00:31:06,598 --> 00:31:08,725
If you're fucking lying,
I'll kill you...

311
00:31:08,833 --> 00:31:10,198
and I'll kill you fucking slowly.

312
00:31:10,768 --> 00:31:13,737
I traded a pickup
truck for that BMW.

313
00:31:14,138 --> 00:31:18,700
A 1993 Ford F-150.

314
00:31:19,244 --> 00:31:20,711
Call them, mister.

315
00:31:21,746 --> 00:31:22,678
Yeah.

316
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:26,710
I stole the money,
but not with a suitcase.

317
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:29,409
I used a paper bag.

318
00:31:51,142 --> 00:31:52,131
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

319
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:53,436
You're welcome.
Enjoy.

320
00:31:58,683 --> 00:32:02,050
To the good life and the
fulfillment of our wildest dreams.

321
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:05,714
To my husband may
he ever be so lucky.

322
00:32:23,241 --> 00:32:24,333
Sammy.

323
00:32:26,511 --> 00:32:28,172
We should do that more often.

324
00:32:30,915 --> 00:32:32,405
What got into us?

325
00:32:33,418 --> 00:32:34,612
Cash.

326
00:32:43,361 --> 00:32:44,851
Morning, Mr. Phelan.

327
00:32:45,363 --> 00:32:46,796
Good morning, Mrs. Phelan.

328
00:32:46,931 --> 00:32:48,091
Sleep well?

329
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,795
Yes, I did.

330
00:32:52,437 --> 00:32:53,631
Ready for breakfast?

331
00:32:54,072 --> 00:32:55,039
Yeah.

332
00:32:55,173 --> 00:32:56,572
Breakfast too, huh?

333
00:32:57,542 --> 00:32:58,907
Indeed.

334
00:32:59,077 --> 00:33:02,274
Nothing is too good for
Mr. Lucky, Sam Phelan.

335
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:18,189
- Eat.
- I will.

336
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:21,029
I'm headed for the shower.

337
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:36,108
Hi
Mr. Sam Phelan?

338
00:33:36,247 --> 00:33:38,715
Yeah, you're early we weren't
expecting you till noon.

339
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:40,647
I doubt you are
expecting me at all.

340
00:33:40,752 --> 00:33:43,414
You're the Chunky Chicken
franchise rep, aren't you?

341
00:33:43,988 --> 00:33:44,920
No.

342
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:47,791
Okay, I'm sorry.
I thought...

343
00:33:49,293 --> 00:33:50,624
What can I do for you?

344
00:33:50,762 --> 00:33:52,627
I'd like to talk to you about
your new Range Rover.

345
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:53,857
I'm from the factory.

346
00:33:53,965 --> 00:33:54,989
Yeah, right.

347
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:58,128
- It's kind of bad timing.
- It will only take a minute.

348
00:33:59,971 --> 00:34:01,962
Yeah, okay, come on in.
Just a minute though.

349
00:34:02,073 --> 00:34:03,233
Sure.
Thank you.

350
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:11,313
Take a seat.

351
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:16,747
I was just about to make
a coffee if you want one.

352
00:34:16,854 --> 00:34:18,048
No thanks.

353
00:34:23,861 --> 00:34:25,123
Looking to invest?

354
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:28,392
Oh, yeah. My wife and I we want
to start our own business.

355
00:34:29,467 --> 00:34:30,525
Yeah?

356
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:33,203
Recently consumed cash, did you?

357
00:34:36,274 --> 00:34:38,936
Listen, mister, I don't
have a holding time here so...

358
00:34:39,877 --> 00:34:40,901
Sorry.

359
00:34:41,813 --> 00:34:44,509
So, were you enjoying the Range Rover?

360
00:34:44,649 --> 00:34:46,708
What do you mean, how it handles?
Stuff like that?

361
00:34:46,884 --> 00:34:48,146
It's great, we love it.

362
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,944
How does it compare
to your old car?

363
00:34:51,289 --> 00:34:52,756
That's no comparison.

364
00:34:53,124 --> 00:34:54,523
What was your old car?

365
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:57,956
It's a Buick station wagon.
Piece of crap.

366
00:35:01,866 --> 00:35:03,993
Was it the one with
the wood on the sides?

367
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:12,735
You said you're from the factory.
What factory?

368
00:35:18,549 --> 00:35:19,607
Hey, listen...

369
00:35:20,985 --> 00:35:22,577
I think you better leave now.

370
00:35:22,687 --> 00:35:23,619
This...

371
00:35:24,655 --> 00:35:26,088
business you want...

372
00:35:28,025 --> 00:35:31,552
you're looking to invest...
What? Half a million...

373
00:35:31,662 --> 00:35:32,788
in cash?

374
00:35:32,897 --> 00:35:36,333
Hey, listen, I'm actually expecting somebody,
So, I gotta, I gotta clean up...

375
00:35:36,434 --> 00:35:37,696
and I'm gonna have
to ask you to go.

376
00:35:38,603 --> 00:35:40,002
I'm not leaving, Sam.

377
00:35:40,838 --> 00:35:42,237
What do you mean
you're not leaving?

378
00:35:42,907 --> 00:35:46,206
Who the hell do you think you are?
I'll call the police.

379
00:36:12,403 --> 00:36:14,166
Look, we don't smoke in this house.

380
00:36:25,149 --> 00:36:26,707
You have something of mine.

381
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:29,586
I've never seen you before.

382
00:36:47,838 --> 00:36:49,135
What are you doing?

383
00:36:50,074 --> 00:36:51,006
Please!

384
00:36:53,978 --> 00:36:55,468
You can't do that, alright?

385
00:36:56,914 --> 00:36:57,938
Goddamn it!

386
00:37:00,251 --> 00:37:01,775
Stop!
Stop!

387
00:37:01,852 --> 00:37:03,376
What is he doing?
Stop him!

388
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:09,219
No, no, no!
Don't, don't!

389
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,492
Okay...

390
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:14,190
Hang up the phone.

391
00:37:14,432 --> 00:37:15,626
Go ahead, hang up.

392
00:37:27,645 --> 00:37:28,771
Where is my money?

393
00:37:28,879 --> 00:37:30,176
We have...

394
00:37:31,015 --> 00:37:34,314
most of it, that is.
We spent some.

395
00:37:34,652 --> 00:37:36,017
What are you talking about?
We don't have his money.

396
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:38,214
Save it, Leslie.

397
00:37:40,658 --> 00:37:41,625
I know the truth.

398
00:37:44,829 --> 00:37:46,023
How much did you spend?

399
00:37:49,233 --> 00:37:53,795
- About $70,000, I think.
- Where's the rest?

400
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:56,031
Some's here and
some's in the bank.

401
00:37:56,173 --> 00:37:58,733
- In the bank?
- Several banks, actually.

402
00:37:58,843 --> 00:38:00,470
Avoiding the IRS, huh?

403
00:38:01,078 --> 00:38:02,136
Smart.

404
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:03,777
Dangerous, though.

405
00:38:05,516 --> 00:38:07,313
Funny how money
corrupts, isn't it?

406
00:38:10,921 --> 00:38:11,979
Okay.

407
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:15,319
Here's what we gonna do.

408
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,527
Sam...

409
00:38:18,362 --> 00:38:21,160
go get the rest of the cash
left here in the house, okay?

410
00:38:21,499 --> 00:38:22,761
- Well...
- Do it now.

411
00:38:25,069 --> 00:38:26,036
Leslie...

412
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:28,066
gather up receipts.

413
00:38:28,339 --> 00:38:31,331
You and I, we'll talk about
exactly how much you spent.

414
00:38:31,442 --> 00:38:33,103
You do keep receipts, don't you?

415
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:20,723
$625,731.

416
00:39:23,761 --> 00:39:25,558
Not a bad hole.

417
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:27,687
Not a bad hole at all.

418
00:39:32,436 --> 00:39:33,835
Okay.
It's noon.

419
00:39:33,971 --> 00:39:36,906
Banks need time to gather
up large sums of cash...

420
00:39:36,974 --> 00:39:40,637
So while Leslie is figuring
and I'm counting...

421
00:39:41,145 --> 00:39:44,603
You're going to phone, Sam,
and call everyone of those banks ...

422
00:39:44,782 --> 00:39:46,147
you put my money in...

423
00:39:46,851 --> 00:39:51,015
and tell them you'll be down there today
to pick up that cash. You got it?

424
00:39:57,194 --> 00:39:58,218
What is your total?

425
00:40:01,432 --> 00:40:06,301
$74,316.47.

426
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:11,203
It's more than the $70,000
that you said, isn't it?

427
00:40:12,676 --> 00:40:15,042
I guess I forgot about
some of the other stuff.

428
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,679
That's perfectly natural.

429
00:40:18,883 --> 00:40:20,783
Everything looks so nice too.

430
00:40:21,619 --> 00:40:24,884
That big-screen TV,
the Range Rover.

431
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:26,984
It looks really good.

432
00:40:29,193 --> 00:40:30,182
Thank you.

433
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:31,417
So...

434
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:37,596
So, $625,761 gross...

435
00:40:38,068 --> 00:40:42,368
minus the $ 74,316.47...

436
00:40:42,973 --> 00:40:44,099
equals...

437
00:40:45,676 --> 00:40:52,172
$551,414.53.

438
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:56,253
Correct.

439
00:40:57,388 --> 00:41:01,620
$551,414.53...

440
00:41:01,892 --> 00:41:03,792
is the figure we'll
concentrate on.

441
00:41:05,062 --> 00:41:07,121
Gotta get all that house
stunning cash back, right?

442
00:41:09,834 --> 00:41:10,801
Ready, Sam?

443
00:41:13,204 --> 00:41:14,671
I only got through
to a couple of them.

444
00:41:15,072 --> 00:41:17,131
That's okay, we can
call them on the way there.

445
00:41:18,075 --> 00:41:19,702
Let's go visit those banks.

446
00:41:55,613 --> 00:41:56,580
That's good.

447
00:41:57,615 --> 00:41:58,547
Go on.

448
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:02,345
65, 66 ...

449
00:42:02,887 --> 00:42:03,911
Great.

450
00:42:04,154 --> 00:42:05,086
Next bank.

451
00:42:18,936 --> 00:42:21,097
Well, that was fun, wasn't it?

452
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:24,863
Leslie...

453
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:27,533
Go and get your calculator.

454
00:42:44,094 --> 00:42:45,026
Sit down.

455
00:42:51,268 --> 00:42:52,200
Okay.

456
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:57,036
Subtract these figures
from our running total.

457
00:42:57,808 --> 00:43:00,470
$54,557.

458
00:43:03,113 --> 00:43:05,581
$13,660.

459
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:08,881
$83,000.

460
00:43:10,554 --> 00:43:13,079
$15,236.

461
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:15,517
What's that leave?

462
00:43:15,859 --> 00:43:21,126
$268,184.53.

463
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:24,700
Where's the rest?

464
00:43:25,469 --> 00:43:27,130
We left some with my mother.

465
00:43:28,038 --> 00:43:29,335
With Mommy.

466
00:43:30,674 --> 00:43:32,608
Who could be safer
than Mommies?

467
00:43:34,545 --> 00:43:36,706
You aren't being busy
little bees, are you?

468
00:43:37,181 --> 00:43:38,876
Good job, I got here when I did.

469
00:43:40,117 --> 00:43:41,345
How much?

470
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:43,817
$265,000.

471
00:43:45,489 --> 00:43:47,320
We sure trust
Mommy, don't we?

472
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:56,727
So, U$265,000 subtracted
from our new balance of $268,184.53...

473
00:43:57,501 --> 00:44:01,938
leaves $3184.53.

474
00:44:02,072 --> 00:44:03,369
Where does that go?

475
00:44:06,343 --> 00:44:08,106
Low as change, right?

476
00:44:08,846 --> 00:44:13,078
That kind of money goes for candy,
cigarettes, that kind of stuff, right?

477
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:14,376
We don't smoke.

478
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:16,143
No?

479
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,309
That's too bad.

480
00:44:26,063 --> 00:44:28,258
You don't mind if I smoke
in the house, do you?

481
00:44:41,645 --> 00:44:42,805
Thank you very much.

482
00:44:45,749 --> 00:44:47,478
Alright,
let's get back to business.

483
00:44:48,218 --> 00:44:56,819
We will add this $3184.53
the  $74,316.47 deficit...

484
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:00,293
We'll already have less the money
you spent before I got here, right?

485
00:45:00,998 --> 00:45:05,935
That comes to what?
$77,501.

486
00:45:15,612 --> 00:45:16,909
It's been a long day.

487
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:18,841
I'm hungry.

488
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:23,517
Leslie, why don't you slip into the
kitchen and cook us up a nice meal?

489
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:28,184
That way, we don't have to go out anymore.
We'll all stay together.

490
00:45:28,358 --> 00:45:29,552
Isn't that something nice?

491
00:45:36,867 --> 00:45:37,799
Go on.

492
00:45:58,155 --> 00:46:00,350
Very good, Leslie.
I liked it.

493
00:46:01,492 --> 00:46:02,516
But what was it?

494
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:05,225
Eggplant, tofu
and veggie steaks.

495
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:06,657
Veggie steaks?

496
00:46:06,797 --> 00:46:08,025
We don't eat red meat.

497
00:46:08,532 --> 00:46:11,330
Why not? Scared to
get mad cow disease?

498
00:46:14,671 --> 00:46:15,603
Alright.

499
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:19,167
I think I'll go and watch
a little big-screen TV.

500
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:24,077
Then we all better turn in. Gonna look
brighter now with your granny tomorrow.

501
00:46:24,882 --> 00:46:26,042
You're sleeping with us?

502
00:46:27,050 --> 00:46:28,142
Is that an invitation?

503
00:46:29,953 --> 00:46:31,113
You know what I mean.

504
00:46:31,755 --> 00:46:32,915
Yes, I know.

505
00:46:36,927 --> 00:46:38,053
You can sleep on the couch.

506
00:46:38,395 --> 00:46:39,327
Thanks.

507
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:44,629
What have you got us into?

508
00:46:45,035 --> 00:46:46,434
- Me?
- Yes.

509
00:46:46,770 --> 00:46:48,397
Now you point the finger.

510
00:46:48,605 --> 00:46:50,766
That's funny. You didn't mind
spending it yesterday.

511
00:46:52,843 --> 00:46:54,037
I'm calling the police.

512
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:56,673
Put the phone down.

513
00:46:57,147 --> 00:46:58,876
Put the phone...
Give me that!

514
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:00,677
Stop it!
Give it to...!

515
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:04,784
Look, let's just weigh it out.

516
00:47:05,455 --> 00:47:08,856
Okay, if we call the cops now, they'll
ask questions, lots of questions.

517
00:47:09,059 --> 00:47:11,220
That'd be trouble and we'll
lose what little we have left.

518
00:47:12,696 --> 00:47:16,462
Tomorrow he'll be gone, we still
have all the stuff we bought.

519
00:47:17,534 --> 00:47:19,502
Those are pretty cool stuff.

520
00:47:19,903 --> 00:47:20,835
It's not so bad.

521
00:47:20,938 --> 00:47:22,997
No, that is what I was afraid of.

522
00:47:25,075 --> 00:47:27,168
I wish you never found
that goddamn money.

523
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:31,511
Let's just go to sleep, okay?

524
00:47:48,899 --> 00:47:50,992
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, honey.

525
00:48:00,010 --> 00:48:02,205
Mom, you know that carton
we left with you?

526
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:03,873
We need it back.

527
00:48:04,081 --> 00:48:07,346
Honey, you said you needed
it kept safe. I hid it, dear.

528
00:48:07,517 --> 00:48:10,042
That's fine Mom,
but we need it back now.

529
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:13,314
Really, sweetie, it couldn't
be safer than where it is.

530
00:48:13,457 --> 00:48:14,924
What couldn't be safer?

531
00:48:15,759 --> 00:48:18,819
Well, whatever is in the box, of course.

532
00:48:20,197 --> 00:48:21,164
Go and get it.

533
00:48:22,432 --> 00:48:24,059
Mom, please, go get the box.

534
00:48:29,706 --> 00:48:31,640
Who the hell do you think you are?

535
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:34,605
I'm one of those people
you'll never meet...

536
00:48:34,678 --> 00:48:36,942
as long as you're a
straight and honest citizen.

537
00:48:37,147 --> 00:48:40,207
Now, what would you have done if we
turned the goddamn money over the police?

538
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:42,313
But you didn't,
did you, Sam?

539
00:48:43,387 --> 00:48:45,014
So there's no way of ever knowing that.

540
00:48:52,696 --> 00:48:54,027
Hey, come here.

541
00:48:54,231 --> 00:48:55,220
Give it to me.

542
00:49:13,050 --> 00:49:15,109
You took some,
didn't you, Mommy?

543
00:49:16,753 --> 00:49:18,482
- How much did you steal?
- Hey come on, that's enough.

544
00:49:18,588 --> 00:49:20,317
I didn't steal a cent.

545
00:49:22,926 --> 00:49:25,156
- I just borrowed a little.
- Mother.

546
00:49:26,897 --> 00:49:28,125
How much did you borrow?

547
00:49:28,298 --> 00:49:31,893
About $600.
It was a loan!

548
00:49:32,002 --> 00:49:35,199
I needed it! I'm on fixed
income. I was gonna put it back!

549
00:49:35,339 --> 00:49:38,001
Mother, we left that with
you for safekeeping.

550
00:49:38,108 --> 00:49:40,201
I just took a little peek, honey.
There was so much.

551
00:49:40,277 --> 00:49:41,767
It wasn't yours!

552
00:49:42,012 --> 00:49:44,480
Well, it wasn't yours either, was it?

553
00:49:48,952 --> 00:49:50,214
Here's a lesson...

554
00:49:52,122 --> 00:49:54,750
when it comes to cash,
nobody can be trusted.

555
00:49:57,494 --> 00:49:58,825
Like mother, like daughter.

556
00:50:15,412 --> 00:50:17,243
Switch the engine off
and give me the key.

557
00:50:19,416 --> 00:50:20,348
Stay put.

558
00:50:21,418 --> 00:50:22,407
Both of you .

559
00:50:34,698 --> 00:50:35,858
Sam, what are we doing?

560
00:51:00,157 --> 00:51:01,624
Sam, what are we doing?

561
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:04,554
I don't know, Les, alright. I don't
even know what we should be doing.

562
00:51:04,694 --> 00:51:06,787
Do we even have a right here?
I don't know anymore.

563
00:51:06,930 --> 00:51:08,397
Of course we have no right.

564
00:51:08,498 --> 00:51:10,466
He's forcing us to do something
against our will.

565
00:51:10,534 --> 00:51:11,558
Yes, he do, huh.

566
00:51:11,668 --> 00:51:14,796
Coz we are the ones who took the money
you know, we decided to keep it.

567
00:51:15,038 --> 00:51:16,369
We knew it wasn't ours.

568
00:51:18,308 --> 00:51:19,297
Hi, there.

569
00:51:20,310 --> 00:51:21,504
I'm just checking out.

570
00:51:24,147 --> 00:51:25,512
You owe me $58.

571
00:51:26,049 --> 00:51:27,573
We don't give no refund.

572
00:51:28,552 --> 00:51:29,644
What?

573
00:51:31,655 --> 00:51:33,680
No refunds.

574
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:38,122
I paid you $203 for seven days,
at $29 a day.

575
00:51:39,262 --> 00:51:40,422
I only stayed five days.

576
00:51:40,497 --> 00:51:42,294
You owe me $58 for the
two days I won't be staying.

577
00:51:42,365 --> 00:51:43,855
What, you got shit
in your ears, mister?

578
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:46,368
I said no goddamn refund!

579
00:51:46,503 --> 00:51:48,971
Now get on down the road
before I call the cops.

580
00:52:00,517 --> 00:52:04,385
Next, I'll break your arms, your leg...

581
00:52:05,689 --> 00:52:07,088
and finally your neck.

582
00:52:11,428 --> 00:52:12,395
Now...

583
00:52:14,698 --> 00:52:16,427
just count all the
money you owe me...

584
00:52:17,267 --> 00:52:18,461
and hand it over.

585
00:52:30,013 --> 00:52:31,446
Maybe forgetting something.

586
00:52:32,082 --> 00:52:34,812
What?
You want a receipt?

587
00:52:35,652 --> 00:52:37,552
My day.
What about my day?

588
00:52:40,423 --> 00:52:41,754
Have a nice day?

589
00:52:41,958 --> 00:52:43,482
Good.
I will.

590
00:52:44,327 --> 00:52:46,488
- Thank you.
- Same to you.

591
00:52:53,770 --> 00:52:54,702
Okay.

592
00:52:55,238 --> 00:52:56,170
Let's go.

593
00:52:56,706 --> 00:52:57,638
Leslie?

594
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:08,282
Okay...

595
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:11,951
I need to go back out.

596
00:53:18,495 --> 00:53:20,258
But I need you both
to stay in the house.

597
00:53:25,535 --> 00:53:26,763
Can I trust you to do that?

598
00:53:29,172 --> 00:53:30,104
Yes.

599
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:35,511
Did you see the blood on his shirt?

600
00:53:35,946 --> 00:53:38,574
He took out a guy
in that motel today.

601
00:53:38,915 --> 00:53:41,713
He's crazy.
We gotta call the police.

602
00:53:41,851 --> 00:53:43,409
We should have called it yesterday.

603
00:53:44,254 --> 00:53:46,916
We can do it tonight
after he's asleep.

604
00:53:49,292 --> 00:53:50,224
I found them.

605
00:53:50,961 --> 00:53:52,792
How fucking nice work, bro.

606
00:53:53,797 --> 00:53:57,756
I recovered $547,433.

607
00:53:58,268 --> 00:54:01,465
That's fucking brilliant, Pyke.
Fuck me!

608
00:54:02,806 --> 00:54:03,795
There's more of it.

609
00:54:03,974 --> 00:54:05,134
Really? How much?

610
00:54:05,308 --> 00:54:09,802
- Some $78,298 still outstanding.
- Where is it?

611
00:54:10,547 --> 00:54:11,605
They spent it.

612
00:54:11,781 --> 00:54:14,477
That's okay, fuck you.
We still got $250k a piece, right?

613
00:54:14,618 --> 00:54:16,711
No.
I'm going after the rest.

614
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:18,012
What do you mean?

615
00:54:21,324 --> 00:54:23,315
Come on, bro.
Give me a fucking break!

616
00:54:23,727 --> 00:54:25,319
Please, just this once.

617
00:54:25,862 --> 00:54:28,422
- They spent it, bro, it's gone.
- It's not gone.

618
00:54:28,965 --> 00:54:30,489
It's just be misplaced.

619
00:54:31,668 --> 00:54:33,033
I'll get it replaced.

620
00:54:34,838 --> 00:54:35,805
Okay.

621
00:54:37,607 --> 00:54:39,040
Have it your fucking way.

622
00:54:40,343 --> 00:54:41,401
As usual.

623
00:54:41,745 --> 00:54:43,042
Do what you fucking like.

624
00:54:45,649 --> 00:54:48,015
I'll see you when I
get out of this shithole.

625
00:55:04,834 --> 00:55:07,268
Let's talk about the rest
of the money you owe.

626
00:55:07,504 --> 00:55:08,732
What are you talking about?

627
00:55:15,745 --> 00:55:18,873
What are you talking about?
We spent the rest, right, it's gone.

628
00:55:19,449 --> 00:55:21,007
And now we have to get it back.

629
00:55:22,519 --> 00:55:28,253
The outstanding deficit is $78,298.

630
00:55:28,725 --> 00:55:29,749
What?

631
00:55:35,398 --> 00:55:38,526
Why don't you just take the Range Rover,
take the new furniture, take it all?

632
00:55:38,668 --> 00:55:39,930
I don't want your goods, Sam.

633
00:55:40,937 --> 00:55:42,234
I'm not a merchant.

634
00:55:43,139 --> 00:55:45,801
I'm more like a banker.
I require cash.

635
00:55:46,976 --> 00:55:49,570
We don't have $78,000l!

636
00:55:49,713 --> 00:55:52,011
$78,298.

637
00:55:52,115 --> 00:55:53,946
We don't have that, either.

638
00:55:55,618 --> 00:55:57,813
You know what?
Can't you just leave?

639
00:55:57,954 --> 00:55:59,979
You have $500,000 plus.

640
00:56:00,290 --> 00:56:02,053
Just leave us alone!

641
00:56:02,625 --> 00:56:04,354
We're sorry we spent some.

642
00:56:04,494 --> 00:56:07,361
We felt God smiled down on us.
We were wrong.

643
00:56:07,497 --> 00:56:08,691
We're sorry.

644
00:56:11,034 --> 00:56:12,797
Nothing is free, Leslie.

645
00:56:14,137 --> 00:56:15,331
Not in this life.

646
00:56:17,273 --> 00:56:19,138
You knew that money
wasn't yours.

647
00:56:20,110 --> 00:56:21,168
And you spent it.

648
00:56:22,445 --> 00:56:23,912
Now you have to pay.

649
00:56:28,251 --> 00:56:29,650
What are you gonna do?

650
00:56:30,887 --> 00:56:31,979
Kill us?

651
00:56:32,389 --> 00:56:33,788
We don't have it!

652
00:56:34,424 --> 00:56:36,483
Let's not discuss
consequences.

653
00:56:37,994 --> 00:56:41,794
Let just focus on how you're
gonna get my money back.

654
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:52,239
Good food, Leslie.

655
00:56:53,243 --> 00:56:55,643
Better if it was meat,
but good all the same.

656
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:58,040
Sam cooked it.

657
00:56:59,482 --> 00:57:01,143
Real domestic, yeah, Sam?

658
00:57:05,221 --> 00:57:07,553
Okay, there's something I need
you both to do for me now.

659
00:57:08,892 --> 00:57:09,859
What's it?

660
00:57:10,059 --> 00:57:12,084
I need both of your personal cell phones.

661
00:57:18,802 --> 00:57:19,826
Get it.

662
00:57:26,643 --> 00:57:27,575
Thank you.

663
00:57:47,964 --> 00:57:51,832
Leslie, could you go to the kitchen
and ring your phone, please?

664
00:57:54,037 --> 00:57:55,004
Yeah.

665
00:57:55,338 --> 00:57:58,569
I noticed another jack.
Where does that one lead?

666
00:57:59,709 --> 00:58:00,641
In the bedroom.

667
00:58:02,378 --> 00:58:04,869
Can you bring the phone
from the bedroom, Leslie?

668
00:58:06,115 --> 00:58:07,776
- Yes
- Thanks.

669
00:58:12,121 --> 00:58:14,749
We're coming to the tricky part
of this recovery action here.

670
00:58:16,059 --> 00:58:17,788
And I wanna keep
it private, don't you?

671
00:58:19,162 --> 00:58:21,460
We're getting to a place now
where you and Leslie...

672
00:58:21,531 --> 00:58:23,590
have to dig into your own pockets.

673
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:28,530
And you know when that happens people
want to make call to somebody.

674
00:58:28,972 --> 00:58:31,998
Strange thing.
Human nature, I guess.

675
00:58:33,476 --> 00:58:35,444
They always want
to make that call.

676
00:58:43,052 --> 00:58:47,421
Now, why don't you two tell me your
plan in getting the rest of my money?

677
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:49,151
We don't have a damn plan.

678
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:53,329
We can sell the Range Rover,
it's worth about $ 70,000...

679
00:58:54,030 --> 00:58:57,363
sell new furniture and I don't know,
borrow the rest from friends.

680
00:58:58,001 --> 00:59:00,663
Just to borrowing from friends, good luck.

681
00:59:01,137 --> 00:59:05,096
The Range Rover, okay.
But the furniture, no, it takes too long.

682
00:59:07,010 --> 00:59:09,274
I'm giving you five days
from right now.

683
00:59:10,547 --> 00:59:12,105
And if we can't do it by then?

684
00:59:13,416 --> 00:59:16,112
No consequences in advance.

685
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:21,416
You learn consequences
only when a line is crossed...

686
00:59:21,925 --> 00:59:23,950
and a decision is made.

687
00:59:33,703 --> 00:59:34,727
Oh yeah.

688
00:59:40,076 --> 00:59:41,509
It's in pretty decent shape.

689
00:59:42,712 --> 00:59:44,543
- I'll give 47 for it.
- What?

690
00:59:44,681 --> 00:59:46,774
Wait a second,
what are you talking about?

691
00:59:46,950 --> 00:59:49,578
We paid almost $70,000
a week ago, cash.

692
00:59:49,686 --> 00:59:51,085
Yeah, yeah.

693
00:59:51,220 --> 00:59:52,152
No.

694
00:59:52,221 --> 00:59:55,019
You see, I sold you a new vehicle
and you brought me back a used one.

695
00:59:55,091 --> 00:59:58,424
It's only got 190 miles on it,
for Christ's sake.

696
00:59:58,561 --> 01:00:01,086
Tell you what I'm gonna do,
and it's my best deal ever.

697
01:00:01,230 --> 01:00:05,963
I'll give you $53,000 for it
and I'll throw in the old car for you.

698
01:00:07,770 --> 01:00:09,294
How does that sound, huh?

699
01:00:10,106 --> 01:00:11,539
Can you deliver it  in cash?

700
01:00:15,545 --> 01:00:20,346
So $ 53,000 from $78,298...

701
01:00:20,416 --> 01:00:24,546
leaves an outstanding deficit
of $25,298.

702
01:00:24,687 --> 01:00:27,656
Can't you just give us a goddamn break?

703
01:00:27,957 --> 01:00:29,447
Do you mean,
I'll assume your debt?

704
01:00:29,626 --> 01:00:32,094
The answer is no,
I won't.

705
01:00:35,264 --> 01:00:38,165
Look, we can't get any more.

706
01:00:40,169 --> 01:00:41,534
You still own a house.

707
01:00:46,409 --> 01:00:47,899
Goddamnit, Leslie!

708
01:00:48,044 --> 01:00:50,342
You are not getting our house, bastard!

709
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:52,175
I don't want your house, Leslie.

710
01:00:53,916 --> 01:00:55,679
I was thinking
more along the lines of...

711
01:00:58,788 --> 01:01:00,722
cash refinancing.

712
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:03,254
No.
Not our house.

713
01:01:03,793 --> 01:01:06,193
Will we stop this crap now?

714
01:01:06,329 --> 01:01:08,559
This shit has gone far enough!

715
01:01:09,265 --> 01:01:11,825
Sam, this fucker is full of shit!

716
01:01:12,168 --> 01:01:13,760
What can he do
in broad daylight?

717
01:01:13,903 --> 01:01:17,395
Let's just get out, Sam, walk away.
Get out the damn jalopy.

718
01:01:17,540 --> 01:01:19,531
Leslie, you make
a decision now...

719
01:01:20,710 --> 01:01:23,702
and you live with the consequences after,
remember that?

720
01:01:24,947 --> 01:01:26,039
Fuck you.

721
01:01:28,418 --> 01:01:30,682
It is an idle threat, Sam.
That's all, he's bullshit!

722
01:01:39,162 --> 01:01:40,493
Get in the car, Leslie.

723
01:01:44,033 --> 01:01:45,898
- He's bluffing.
- Get in the car.

724
01:01:45,968 --> 01:01:47,959
He's a damn bully.
We can walk away.

725
01:01:48,104 --> 01:01:49,332
- Let's go.
- Let's call the police.

726
01:02:02,919 --> 01:02:03,851
Where?

727
01:02:03,986 --> 01:02:05,749
Where the house is financed.

728
01:02:12,028 --> 01:02:15,486
Mr. and Mrs. Phelan, is it your
wish that this gentleman be privy...

729
01:02:15,565 --> 01:02:17,294
to your personal financial affairs?

730
01:02:17,834 --> 01:02:19,529
Yeah, sure.
Why the hell not?

731
01:02:20,470 --> 01:02:23,303
What was the original purchase
price of the house?

732
01:02:23,539 --> 01:02:26,667
The original purchase price
was $200,000.

733
01:02:26,876 --> 01:02:27,934
Purchased when?

734
01:02:30,379 --> 01:02:31,607
Five years ago.

735
01:02:32,348 --> 01:02:34,316
What is the amount
of their monthly payment?

736
01:02:36,152 --> 01:02:38,916
$647.70 a month.

737
01:02:39,455 --> 01:02:40,547
Term of loan?

738
01:02:40,690 --> 01:02:42,021
29 years.

739
01:02:42,291 --> 01:02:43,349
How much down?

740
01:02:43,593 --> 01:02:46,528
Well, 10%,
$20,000.

741
01:02:47,396 --> 01:02:50,524
So, if down payment being the same as equity...

742
01:02:51,634 --> 01:02:54,626
they day they bought the house
that's $20,000 equity...

743
01:02:54,771 --> 01:02:58,832
- And still have that amount today, yeah?
- Well, yes, technically, yes.

744
01:02:58,975 --> 01:03:02,376
They've been paying monthly
payments, faithfully...

745
01:03:02,612 --> 01:03:04,307
for the last five years...

746
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:09,942
which comes to $38,862, right?

747
01:03:17,527 --> 01:03:21,361
38,862.
That's correct.

748
01:03:21,597 --> 01:03:27,263
So, discounting interest,
they've paid down about $13,000...

749
01:03:27,770 --> 01:03:29,738
and a mortgage debt,
is that right?

750
01:03:35,378 --> 01:03:36,367
Yes.

751
01:03:36,712 --> 01:03:38,111
That's just about right, yes.

752
01:03:38,247 --> 01:03:41,341
So they still owe $167,000.

753
01:03:41,517 --> 01:03:45,954
Now, during these past five years,
the property has appreciated.

754
01:03:46,322 --> 01:03:47,619
Well, yes, of course.

755
01:03:47,757 --> 01:03:50,817
But we can't be certain on how
much without an appraisal.

756
01:03:50,927 --> 01:03:53,088
Yeah, nevertheless, it has appreciated.

757
01:03:54,030 --> 01:03:57,557
Let's use a conservative figure,
say $20,000 over five years.

758
01:03:59,168 --> 01:04:02,934
That sums easily to what?
$4,000 per year.

759
01:04:03,472 --> 01:04:05,497
I would say that's optimistic
would you?

760
01:04:06,242 --> 01:04:08,437
No, that sounds reasonable.

761
01:04:08,711 --> 01:04:09,678
Okay.

762
01:04:10,012 --> 01:04:15,609
So, discounting appreciation
with their original down payment...

763
01:04:16,419 --> 01:04:20,116
they have $53,000
equity in the house.

764
01:04:20,489 --> 01:04:23,583
And as such, I see no reason
why this institution...

765
01:04:23,726 --> 01:04:27,355
should not lend them a
$25,298 they seek...

766
01:04:27,830 --> 01:04:30,264
less than half
their existing equity.

767
01:04:31,534 --> 01:04:33,161
Well, I...

768
01:04:34,637 --> 01:04:36,002
We quit our jobs.

769
01:04:37,573 --> 01:04:39,473
- You're unemployed?
- Yeah.

770
01:04:46,215 --> 01:04:48,877
Are you familiar with the
Newer Dock Home Equity Loan?

771
01:04:49,352 --> 01:04:50,876
Yeah, of course.

772
01:04:51,754 --> 01:04:52,778
Yeah?

773
01:04:53,789 --> 01:04:58,283
You see, the Newer Dock requires
no employment, no income or assets.

774
01:04:58,561 --> 01:05:02,088
Lenders do not verify any information
beyond the credit profile

775
01:05:02,231 --> 01:05:04,859
- and value of the property.
- Of course.

776
01:05:08,738 --> 01:05:10,501
The Phelans have equity.

777
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:13,072
They could easily get
a loan equal to 80%.

778
01:05:13,209 --> 01:05:15,973
Well, I don't know that this bank
has ever issued a New Dock loan.

779
01:05:16,045 --> 01:05:17,774
I don't know that we can do it.

780
01:05:18,014 --> 01:05:19,413
Their credit rating...

781
01:05:19,949 --> 01:05:21,075
Listen...

782
01:05:21,584 --> 01:05:24,075
I think you're missing
a big opportunity here, Mr. Dink.

783
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:25,409
It's Dale.

784
01:05:27,390 --> 01:05:28,618
- Mr. Dale.
- Yeah, whatever.

785
01:05:29,292 --> 01:05:31,157
We could go elsewhere for the money...

786
01:05:31,694 --> 01:05:35,027
and I'm sure your branch manager
would be very unhappy to lose a business...

787
01:05:35,164 --> 01:05:38,190
especially in view of the fact
that this institution...

788
01:05:38,334 --> 01:05:39,767
holds the first mortgage.

789
01:05:40,536 --> 01:05:42,731
But it's urgent.

790
01:05:43,005 --> 01:05:45,565
These people
need the cash today.

791
01:05:47,243 --> 01:05:48,608
Name your terms.

792
01:05:49,211 --> 01:05:53,238
At today's prices, they have more
equity than necessary...

793
01:05:54,116 --> 01:05:57,984
more money for the bank if you decide
to foreclose, you get me what I mean here?

794
01:05:58,120 --> 01:05:59,280
It's a sweet deal.

795
01:06:00,890 --> 01:06:03,757
There might even be a
promotion in it, somebody...

796
01:06:06,362 --> 01:06:09,525
Perhaps, I could consider a
small home equity loan...

797
01:06:09,665 --> 01:06:11,758
you know, for urgent home repairs.

798
01:06:12,501 --> 01:06:13,661
High interest.

799
01:06:13,970 --> 01:06:15,198
Well, of course.

800
01:06:15,805 --> 01:06:16,863
Well...

801
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:20,035
we take the fair market value...

802
01:06:21,043 --> 01:06:24,740
times 80% loan to value...

803
01:06:25,715 --> 01:06:27,808
and equals $86,000...

804
01:06:27,950 --> 01:06:31,283
minus the compound interest
over the term of the loan.

805
01:06:32,421 --> 01:06:36,653
I can lend $11,421.89.

806
01:06:36,792 --> 01:06:41,229
That's the maximum on a pure
equity loan of an unemployed applicant.

807
01:06:41,364 --> 01:06:42,422
They'll take it.

808
01:06:42,565 --> 01:06:44,192
Make a bank draft to cash.

809
01:06:44,367 --> 01:06:45,698
They'll redeem it here.

810
01:06:51,774 --> 01:06:52,866
So, Sam...

811
01:06:55,011 --> 01:07:00,278
how are you gonna get
the remaining $13,876.11?

812
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:06,955
Why are you keeping me at this?
The money isn't even yours anyway.

813
01:07:07,857 --> 01:07:10,826
That's where you're wrong
The money is mine...

814
01:07:11,560 --> 01:07:14,996
and I will keep it until a superior
power takes it from me.

815
01:07:15,631 --> 01:07:17,360
And so the question remains.

816
01:07:17,767 --> 01:07:23,330
How will you pay me the $13,876.11
that you owe me?

817
01:07:26,208 --> 01:07:28,506
There's your fucking
11 cents!

818
01:07:47,663 --> 01:07:48,891
Thank you, Leslie.

819
01:07:49,065 --> 01:07:51,033
Why can't you just
leave us alone?

820
01:07:51,567 --> 01:07:53,262
I understand your frustration...

821
01:07:54,336 --> 01:07:55,530
I do...

822
01:07:56,405 --> 01:07:57,872
but I must have the full amount.

823
01:07:58,007 --> 01:08:00,635
We don't have it and there's no
place else we can get it.

824
01:08:00,776 --> 01:08:03,609
So, you're just gonna have to kill us
or whatever it is...

825
01:08:03,946 --> 01:08:06,574
Slow down.
Look, everybody's overreacting.

826
01:08:06,849 --> 01:08:09,716
Let's just all settle down, okay?

827
01:08:11,587 --> 01:08:15,751
We'll have a nice meal,
we'll watch some big-screen TV...

828
01:08:16,192 --> 01:08:20,458
and in the morning,
we'll work something out.

829
01:08:21,864 --> 01:08:23,456
You still have another four days.

830
01:08:41,517 --> 01:08:44,509
Les? Les, come on, wake up.
Wake up, wake up.

831
01:08:44,954 --> 01:08:46,649
- What?
- We're leaving.

832
01:08:46,956 --> 01:08:48,685
C'mon, get dressed.
Here.

833
01:08:48,924 --> 01:08:50,016
- What?
- Let's go.

834
01:08:50,259 --> 01:08:52,693
- He'll hear.
- Fuck him. Come on.

835
01:08:53,529 --> 01:08:55,190
- Let's go, let's go. Come on.
- Okay.

836
01:08:58,734 --> 01:08:59,666
Okay.

837
01:09:00,369 --> 01:09:01,301
Okay.

838
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:32,934
Out for a midnight stroll?

839
01:09:36,138 --> 01:09:39,733
I understand this is your first
experience in a situation like this...

840
01:09:40,676 --> 01:09:43,270
So I'm go to overlook
tonight in discretion.

841
01:09:43,846 --> 01:09:45,177
But understand this.

842
01:09:45,447 --> 01:09:49,645
Until I get my money,
you will not leave this house.

843
01:09:50,186 --> 01:09:52,814
You will not phone anyone
or meet anyone...

844
01:09:52,955 --> 01:09:56,516
unless I give my permission.
Is that understood?

845
01:09:57,226 --> 01:09:59,626
- Is that understood?
- Yes.

846
01:10:03,065 --> 01:10:03,997
Leslie?

847
01:10:04,266 --> 01:10:06,393
Yes, fucking yes!
Okay?

848
01:10:09,538 --> 01:10:11,096
Now get back to bed.

849
01:10:26,322 --> 01:10:27,311
Good morning.

850
01:10:28,791 --> 01:10:30,088
Everybody sleep well?

851
01:10:46,275 --> 01:10:47,401
What the hell is this?

852
01:10:49,278 --> 01:10:51,803
I did a little shopping
while you people are sleeping.

853
01:10:53,315 --> 01:10:54,179
Meat.

854
01:10:58,387 --> 01:11:04,622
Why don't you slip over to the stove there, Sam,
and cook up some eggs and meat for Leslie and me?

855
01:11:05,861 --> 01:11:06,953
What?

856
01:11:07,229 --> 01:11:09,789
Eggs, Sam.
I want eggs.

857
01:11:15,471 --> 01:11:16,529
Are you gonna cook or not?

858
01:11:16,805 --> 01:11:18,739
- I'll do it.
- No. I want Sam to do it.

859
01:11:19,942 --> 01:11:22,001
He's a domestic man,
aren't you Sam?

860
01:11:23,012 --> 01:11:24,104
What are you doing?

861
01:11:24,647 --> 01:11:25,671
Stop it.

862
01:11:27,583 --> 01:11:29,551
I just want him to do.
That's all, Leslie.

863
01:11:29,918 --> 01:11:33,410
This is ridiculous.
It's the elementary school crap!

864
01:11:40,696 --> 01:11:41,958
What's it gonna be, Sam?

865
01:11:47,603 --> 01:11:49,696
Whatever.
Eggs, no big deal.

866
01:11:57,012 --> 01:11:58,843
And meat, Sam.

867
01:12:09,825 --> 01:12:11,725
Make mine scrambled
will you?

868
01:12:13,595 --> 01:12:15,324
How do you like your eggs,
Leslie?

869
01:12:16,198 --> 01:12:17,563
Fuck you.

870
01:12:21,003 --> 01:12:22,470
It's easy for a woman, isn't it?

871
01:12:23,372 --> 01:12:26,637
No physical threat,
without fear of reprisal.

872
01:12:27,409 --> 01:12:30,674
You can just simply open
your big beautiful mouth...

873
01:12:31,013 --> 01:12:35,245
and say whatever foul things
that comes into your head, right?

874
01:12:40,622 --> 01:12:41,987
Come, sit by me.

875
01:13:23,365 --> 01:13:24,354
Sam.

876
01:13:24,900 --> 01:13:26,265
Go in there and rob it.

877
01:13:26,668 --> 01:13:28,067
Bring me the money back.

878
01:13:28,303 --> 01:13:29,634
- Wait, what?
- Are you crazy?

879
01:13:29,772 --> 01:13:31,034
Hey, I can't do that!

880
01:13:31,373 --> 01:13:32,431
Shit!

881
01:13:32,808 --> 01:13:36,437
Get on the way, you can do it, Sam.
You'll be surprise how easy it is.

882
01:13:37,012 --> 01:13:41,415
You see, the majority of men are
cowards, ain't that right, Sam?

883
01:13:42,217 --> 01:13:44,151
All women are cowards.

884
01:13:44,353 --> 01:13:49,052
Fear of this gun will drive them
to obey every command...

885
01:13:49,358 --> 01:13:53,488
just as you obey mine.
Now, get in there and do it.

886
01:13:55,030 --> 01:13:57,498
Running time for my orders, Sam.
I want my fucking money.

887
01:13:57,566 --> 01:14:00,330
- Now, go in there and do it.
- Alright, alright. Just relax.

888
01:14:05,841 --> 01:14:06,773
Sam?

889
01:14:07,709 --> 01:14:08,733
Your phone.

890
01:14:09,178 --> 01:14:10,202
Fuck.

891
01:14:19,555 --> 01:14:20,487
Hello?

892
01:14:20,622 --> 01:14:21,589
Sam, it's me.

893
01:14:23,125 --> 01:14:24,752
I want you to keep the line open.

894
01:14:25,694 --> 01:14:28,288
I wanna hear everything that's
going on in there, you understand?

895
01:14:28,697 --> 01:14:32,929
If you get ugly, the line goes dead,
your wife goes dead with it,  you understand?

896
01:14:33,001 --> 01:14:33,933
Yeah.

897
01:14:44,346 --> 01:14:45,643
Give me all the money!

898
01:14:46,715 --> 01:14:48,046
Paper or plastic?

899
01:14:48,150 --> 01:14:49,811
Jesus Christ, I don't care!

900
01:15:06,802 --> 01:15:08,201
Fuck you!

901
01:15:08,537 --> 01:15:09,561
Fuck you!

902
01:15:11,773 --> 01:15:12,967
It's good, ain't it?

903
01:15:17,513 --> 01:15:18,502
Give me the gun, Sam.

904
01:15:26,455 --> 01:15:29,083
Count the money for him, Leslie.
He seems a little nervous.

905
01:15:30,158 --> 01:15:31,557
Let's see how you did, Sam.

906
01:15:38,033 --> 01:15:39,125
How much, baby?

907
01:15:42,337 --> 01:15:43,565
$464.

908
01:15:44,273 --> 01:15:45,467
$464.

909
01:15:46,041 --> 01:15:47,668
That's not a great score, Sam.

910
01:15:47,943 --> 01:15:49,240
Why didn't you get the coins?

911
01:15:49,411 --> 01:15:51,470
What do you mean, I didn't get the coins!
I didn't I'm supposed to!

912
01:15:51,613 --> 01:15:55,811
Now, you got that from the movies, right?
That's what stupid movies get you.

913
01:15:56,018 --> 01:15:57,986
Money is money.
You get it all.

914
01:16:01,189 --> 01:16:02,121
Okay.

915
01:16:03,926 --> 01:16:06,622
That's $464,
subtracted from...

916
01:16:07,663 --> 01:16:10,632
the balance of $13,876.

917
01:16:10,699 --> 01:16:15,033
that comes to $13,412...

918
01:16:15,604 --> 01:16:16,935
left to get.

919
01:16:35,023 --> 01:16:36,115
Your turn.

920
01:16:37,326 --> 01:16:38,258
Not me.

921
01:16:38,360 --> 01:16:39,292
Why?

922
01:16:39,695 --> 01:16:40,662
Because you're a woman?

923
01:16:41,096 --> 01:16:43,792
The vagina gives you
special privileges, does it?

924
01:16:45,500 --> 01:16:47,968
You, American women
always want equality.

925
01:16:48,203 --> 01:16:49,727
Well, I'm giving it to you.

926
01:16:51,540 --> 01:16:53,531
And get the change this time.

927
01:17:08,256 --> 01:17:09,188
Leslie?

928
01:17:12,494 --> 01:17:13,483
Same deal.

929
01:17:14,162 --> 01:17:18,121
You get killed in there
and Sam he pays the price.

930
01:17:19,601 --> 01:17:20,533
Okay?

931
01:17:42,958 --> 01:17:43,947
Got it.

932
01:18:00,809 --> 01:18:01,776
Raise your hands!

933
01:18:02,177 --> 01:18:03,610
Give me the money, asshole!

934
01:18:05,847 --> 01:18:07,007
Come on, come on!

935
01:18:08,483 --> 01:18:09,745
Put it in a bag!

936
01:18:13,889 --> 01:18:14,981
The coins too!

937
01:18:18,160 --> 01:18:19,092
Come on!

938
01:18:21,496 --> 01:18:22,929
And give me a pack of cigarettes.

939
01:18:23,398 --> 01:18:24,330
What kind?

940
01:18:24,433 --> 01:18:26,162
- I don't care, the green ones.
- Menthol?

941
01:18:26,301 --> 01:18:27,996
Just give me a goddamn carton!

942
01:18:32,708 --> 01:18:33,675
Get on the floor!

943
01:18:34,743 --> 01:18:37,769
Get down and don't move
for 5 minutes or you die!

944
01:18:54,463 --> 01:18:55,521
Give me the gun.

945
01:19:06,708 --> 01:19:09,836
Physical power over others
tastes sweet in the mouth.

946
01:19:10,879 --> 01:19:12,244
Especially for a woman...

947
01:19:13,749 --> 01:19:15,774
who doesn't often
get the experience.

948
01:19:18,687 --> 01:19:20,416
Feeds you like mother's milk.

949
01:19:22,758 --> 01:19:26,694
It's almost sexual, isn't it Leslie?

950
01:19:36,571 --> 01:19:37,799
Hey, where did you get those?

951
01:19:39,207 --> 01:19:40,333
I took them.

952
01:19:41,576 --> 01:19:42,838
Oh, you shoplifted.

953
01:19:44,613 --> 01:19:45,580
Shoplifted?

954
01:19:51,686 --> 01:19:53,176
Okay, count all the money, Leslie.

955
01:19:59,761 --> 01:20:02,286
$525.87.

956
01:20:04,633 --> 01:20:05,793
My haul was bigger.

957
01:20:17,145 --> 01:20:18,134
Leslie?

958
01:20:25,821 --> 01:20:32,158
The day's total haul is $2128.16.

959
01:20:34,029 --> 01:20:36,657
Subtracted from our
outstanding total leaves...

960
01:20:37,332 --> 01:20:41,166
$11,283.84.

961
01:20:42,070 --> 01:20:46,803
Ain't no great shape, folks. $2,100
for a whole day's work.

962
01:20:47,776 --> 01:20:52,475
Actually, it's $2128.16.

963
01:20:59,554 --> 01:21:01,044
Turn on the TV, Sam.

964
01:21:02,257 --> 01:21:04,657
It's time for the news.
Go.

965
01:21:24,479 --> 01:21:27,209
You're watching
WGN, News at 9.

966
01:21:33,288 --> 01:21:34,220
Sit by me, Leslie.

967
01:21:34,289 --> 01:21:37,190
Armed robberies occurred today
in the Chicago area.

968
01:21:37,525 --> 01:21:40,551
Two men and one woman held up
a liquor store this morning...

969
01:21:40,629 --> 01:21:44,121
and escaped capture.
Police believed it's the same trio...

970
01:21:44,199 --> 01:21:49,159
that went on to rob six more
convenience store in an all day crime spree.

971
01:21:49,304 --> 01:21:53,104
Police estimates, the robbers
got away with over $10,000.

972
01:21:53,241 --> 01:21:54,299
That's bullshit!

973
01:21:54,442 --> 01:21:57,468
There was a lie about the take.
Insurance fraud.

974
01:21:57,812 --> 01:21:59,404
Everybody's crooked.
Everybody.

975
01:21:59,581 --> 01:22:01,981
Police have compiled
the sketch of the trio.

976
01:22:02,484 --> 01:22:05,783
Isn't that stupid? Those drawings
never looked like anybody.

977
01:22:06,021 --> 01:22:10,185
In the history of the world, they've never
caught a criminal based on those stupid things.

978
01:22:11,026 --> 01:22:16,259
99 Store manager
Bahadurjit Tejinderpreet...

979
01:22:16,965 --> 01:22:18,523
who has been robbed
more than ten times.

980
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:20,329
I know that guy.
Bearshit Tenderfeet.

981
01:22:20,635 --> 01:22:24,093
I've been robbed by
the best thieves in Chicago!

982
01:22:24,239 --> 01:22:26,867
These are amateurs!

983
01:22:27,208 --> 01:22:28,232
Fuck him!

984
01:22:29,044 --> 01:22:33,174
The getaway car was a cream-colored
station wagon, believed to be a Buick.

985
01:22:33,682 --> 01:22:34,614
Shit!

986
01:22:34,749 --> 01:22:35,681
In other news...

987
01:22:38,086 --> 01:22:40,111
- They know our car.
- They don't know anything.

988
01:22:40,956 --> 01:22:43,550
They got no license number,
no photos, no names.

989
01:22:44,326 --> 01:22:47,056
Detroit made ten zillion
of those cars. Relax.

990
01:22:47,362 --> 01:22:49,796
Anyway,
Tomorrow, we'll use my car.

991
01:22:57,372 --> 01:22:58,737
You're sideling up to side.

992
01:22:59,274 --> 01:23:00,639
I'm not sideling.

993
01:23:01,176 --> 01:23:04,907
- You sat beside him, Les.
- You cooked his meat.

994
01:23:08,883 --> 01:23:10,043
Sam, I'm sorry.

995
01:23:10,752 --> 01:23:11,741
I'm sorry.

996
01:23:11,886 --> 01:23:14,252
We're both scared of him
and we have a right to be.

997
01:23:14,322 --> 01:23:17,587
He's dangerous.
He's crazy and he's making us crazy.

998
01:23:21,529 --> 01:23:22,621
I'm so sorry.

999
01:23:50,358 --> 01:23:51,848
Empty the register, man.
Let's go!

1000
01:23:53,328 --> 01:23:54,192
Come on, hurry up, hurry up!

1001
01:23:58,033 --> 01:23:59,295
Don't do anything stupid.

1002
01:24:14,883 --> 01:24:16,077
Getting the hang of it, Sam.

1003
01:24:19,721 --> 01:24:20,779
Give me the gun.

1004
01:24:22,357 --> 01:24:25,053
- What kind of gun is this?
- The kind that scares people.

1005
01:24:25,260 --> 01:24:26,352
Now give me.

1006
01:24:27,328 --> 01:24:28,352
But what kind?

1007
01:24:30,732 --> 01:24:35,692
It's a Star Caliber 9mm,
Parabellum, semi-automatic...

1008
01:24:35,770 --> 01:24:37,795
pistol double action.
Made in Spain.

1009
01:24:37,872 --> 01:24:41,364
It weighs 39.68 ounces
and has a 4-inch barrel.

1010
01:24:41,976 --> 01:24:43,967
It fires a 120 gray...

1011
01:24:44,045 --> 01:24:48,038
metal jacketed bullet at
a mussel velocity of 1247 ft/sec.

1012
01:24:48,183 --> 01:24:49,707
Okay, now give me the fucking gun.

1013
01:24:51,319 --> 01:24:52,684
I said give me the fucking gun.

1014
01:24:58,093 --> 01:24:59,219
Nine millimeter.

1015
01:25:36,831 --> 01:25:38,696
Sam, what's happening
to us?

1016
01:25:41,269 --> 01:25:44,500
I watched you today.
You liked that gun.

1017
01:25:47,008 --> 01:25:48,134
Jesus.

1018
01:25:48,443 --> 01:25:49,933
Shut up, Leslie.

1019
01:25:51,513 --> 01:25:53,538
- Sammy!
- No, shut the fuck up.

1020
01:25:56,084 --> 01:25:57,073
Get the money!

1021
01:25:57,218 --> 01:25:58,207
I can't!

1022
01:25:58,353 --> 01:26:00,014
Family needs more money!

1023
01:26:00,155 --> 01:26:02,749
Get the fucking money now!

1024
01:26:03,291 --> 01:26:04,223
No!

1025
01:26:04,359 --> 01:26:05,690
Goddamn you!

1026
01:26:08,897 --> 01:26:10,660
That girl's a natural, Sam.

1027
01:26:17,138 --> 01:26:18,070
Let's go!

1028
01:26:20,675 --> 01:26:22,108
Don't say one fucking word to me!

1029
01:26:30,118 --> 01:26:34,748
Totals out to $5295.52.

1030
01:26:35,023 --> 01:26:36,081
It's not bad at all.

1031
01:26:36,424 --> 01:26:41,418
But we still have an outstanding balance
of $5988.32 and only one day left.

1032
01:26:43,665 --> 01:26:45,758
Turn on the TV, Sam,
it's time for the news.

1033
01:26:46,367 --> 01:26:47,959
Why don't you turn it on yourself?

1034
01:26:52,740 --> 01:26:53,764
Okay, Sam.

1035
01:26:57,212 --> 01:27:00,511
The threesome struck again today,
robbing ten different establishments...

1036
01:27:00,648 --> 01:27:01,706
in Cook County.

1037
01:27:01,849 --> 01:27:03,714
Ten in one day!
It could be a record.

1038
01:27:03,885 --> 01:27:07,514
Captain Johnson said he's never seen
such a desperate run of robberies.

1039
01:27:07,689 --> 01:27:11,887
The getaway car they're using now
is a black Lincoln, with no license plate.

1040
01:27:12,327 --> 01:27:14,522
If caught,
the two men and one woman...

1041
01:27:14,662 --> 01:27:16,960
face armed robbery charges...

1042
01:27:17,031 --> 01:27:19,522
which carries a 20 to 50-year prison term.

1043
01:27:19,667 --> 01:27:20,759
Actually...

1044
01:27:21,202 --> 01:27:26,469
when Leslie pistoled the old chink,
she'll be answered to robbery with aggravated assault...

1045
01:27:26,541 --> 01:27:27,508
It is life.

1046
01:27:27,775 --> 01:27:30,107
I made you do it, but I
didn't mean you like it, did I?

1047
01:27:30,378 --> 01:27:32,005
I wasn't me who made
your panties wet...

1048
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:33,741
when you were robbing those people
was it Leslie?

1049
01:27:33,881 --> 01:27:36,042
Fuck you, alright!
I will not let you do that!

1050
01:27:37,952 --> 01:27:38,884
Stop it!

1051
01:27:40,421 --> 01:27:41,513
Stop it!

1052
01:27:44,525 --> 01:27:45,549
Stop it!

1053
01:27:46,160 --> 01:27:48,094
Stop hitting him, stop it!

1054
01:27:48,263 --> 01:27:49,389
Stop it!

1055
01:27:49,631 --> 01:27:50,859
Stop it, no!

1056
01:28:00,174 --> 01:28:01,141
Come on.

1057
01:28:01,376 --> 01:28:02,400
You okay?

1058
01:28:04,512 --> 01:28:05,740
Get the fuck out of here!

1059
01:31:36,390 --> 01:31:37,721
What do you think?

1060
01:31:38,759 --> 01:31:40,920
Grab my pistol
so you could get my gun?

1061
01:31:41,796 --> 01:31:42,728
What?

1062
01:31:48,002 --> 01:31:50,698
Are you offended I rejected
you offering your pussy?

1063
01:32:00,248 --> 01:32:01,715
Get back to bed, Leslie.

1064
01:32:32,146 --> 01:32:34,011
We can start downtown...

1065
01:32:35,182 --> 01:32:37,013
and make our way south to Cicero.

1066
01:33:05,813 --> 01:33:06,745
No.

1067
01:33:07,214 --> 01:33:09,614
One more score.
We'll hit a bank.

1068
01:33:11,252 --> 01:33:12,276
Too risky.

1069
01:33:13,187 --> 01:33:14,916
The banks are out of your league.

1070
01:33:15,256 --> 01:33:18,919
That kind of job requires
preparation, planning.

1071
01:33:20,094 --> 01:33:23,757
Gets another layout of routines.
This will be alright, son.

1072
01:33:23,898 --> 01:33:26,662
The bank I'm thinking about,
I know everything I need to know.

1073
01:33:29,470 --> 01:33:31,233
We'll stick to the small stuff..

1074
01:33:31,372 --> 01:33:33,067
What's the matter?
Ain't you got the stomach for it?

1075
01:33:41,215 --> 01:33:43,581
I want to finish with this shit.

1076
01:33:43,851 --> 01:33:49,517
I'll never get a full $5988.32
taken to the small stuff.

1077
01:33:50,591 --> 01:33:52,616
Or you'll give a time extension, is that it?

1078
01:33:52,860 --> 01:33:54,521
You're giving me a pass?

1079
01:33:59,567 --> 01:34:00,693
Okay, Sam.

1080
01:34:02,870 --> 01:34:04,201
You get your bank.

1081
01:34:16,817 --> 01:34:17,749
What?

1082
01:34:19,553 --> 01:34:21,453
You got any clean pantyhose?

1083
01:34:29,397 --> 01:34:31,058
Banks are two-man job.

1084
01:34:32,400 --> 01:34:33,992
I'm going in there with you.

1085
01:34:35,002 --> 01:34:37,061
We got no longer
than three minutes, okay.

1086
01:34:38,572 --> 01:34:41,370
Leslie, you keep the monster
running and stay cool.

1087
01:34:42,443 --> 01:34:45,879
No more games, or Sam he pays the price.

1088
01:34:46,147 --> 01:34:48,172
A little late for fucking games.

1089
01:35:03,464 --> 01:35:04,396
Let's go.

1090
01:35:10,871 --> 01:35:11,803
Robbery!

1091
01:35:12,106 --> 01:35:13,733
Get down!
Everybody!

1092
01:35:13,874 --> 01:35:15,341
Nobody fucking moves.

1093
01:35:15,910 --> 01:35:17,878
Once you play hero, you're killed.

1094
01:35:18,546 --> 01:35:20,013
Get on the fucking ground!

1095
01:35:20,247 --> 01:35:21,339
Everybody!

1096
01:35:21,782 --> 01:35:22,714
- Bag all the money!
- Yes, sir!

1097
01:35:22,783 --> 01:35:23,715
Bag it up!

1098
01:35:25,519 --> 01:35:26,884
Nobody moves!

1099
01:35:27,054 --> 01:35:28,214
Open the bolt!

1100
01:35:29,457 --> 01:35:32,358
Stand still there!
No one fucking left here.

1101
01:35:36,063 --> 01:35:37,121
You, get down!

1102
01:35:38,065 --> 01:35:38,997
Go down the stairs!

1103
01:35:45,406 --> 01:35:46,532
Don't fucking move!

1104
01:35:48,442 --> 01:35:49,773
Come on, move it!

1105
01:35:50,745 --> 01:35:51,837
Fucking get down!

1106
01:35:52,213 --> 01:35:53,510
Leave the money and run.

1107
01:35:53,881 --> 01:35:55,815
The alarm has been triggered.
You'll go to prison.

1108
01:35:57,852 --> 01:35:59,217
What the fuck are you doing?

1109
01:35:59,353 --> 01:36:00,547
Move, now!

1110
01:36:03,023 --> 01:36:04,354
You fucking stay down!

1111
01:36:05,893 --> 01:36:07,258
Come out ! Come out!

1112
01:36:18,806 --> 01:36:19,773
Get off!

1113
01:36:32,453 --> 01:36:33,647
How much did we get?

1114
01:37:04,251 --> 01:37:05,411
Are you fucking crazy?

1115
01:37:05,820 --> 01:37:07,151
What the fuck did you just do?

1116
01:37:17,231 --> 01:37:21,998
We owe $5988.32.

1117
01:37:23,237 --> 01:37:24,204
Here it is.

1118
01:37:29,910 --> 01:37:31,707
Now, are we done with it?

1119
01:37:34,248 --> 01:37:36,614
That's right, Sam.
Our business is finished.

1120
01:37:37,384 --> 01:37:38,316
Give me the gun.

1121
01:37:40,321 --> 01:37:41,583
I said, give me the gun.

1122
01:37:42,056 --> 01:37:46,493
Give me that fucking gun, Sam,
or I'll leg really fucking badly this time.

1123
01:37:46,927 --> 01:37:47,859
You believe me?

1124
01:37:50,231 --> 01:37:52,631
Yeah, I believe.

1125
01:37:56,871 --> 01:37:58,429
You don't got the stomach for that.

1126
01:37:59,506 --> 01:38:02,168
You don't have any idea what
the fuck I have the stomach for.

1127
01:38:02,276 --> 01:38:03,208
Sam!

1128
01:38:08,849 --> 01:38:12,683
What do you hope to accomplish
with no fucking bullets, you buddy folk?

1129
01:38:18,492 --> 01:38:19,584
Sammy!

1130
01:38:22,630 --> 01:38:25,394
If you make a move here,
I'll get down and I'll kill you.

1131
01:38:25,566 --> 01:38:27,193
- Believe me?
- Yeah.

1132
01:38:27,368 --> 01:38:30,428
- You believe, motherfucker?
- Yeah, I believe.

1133
01:38:30,571 --> 01:38:33,005
Goddamn right you do.
What's your name?

1134
01:38:33,841 --> 01:38:36,537
- What?
- Your name. I wanna know your fucking name.

1135
01:38:37,711 --> 01:38:38,678
Pyke.

1136
01:38:40,281 --> 01:38:41,976
Pyke?
Pyke what?

1137
01:38:42,716 --> 01:38:43,910
Kubic.

1138
01:38:46,387 --> 01:38:47,911
Pyke Kubic.

1139
01:38:54,194 --> 01:38:55,183
Watch out!

1140
01:38:57,064 --> 01:38:58,031
Go!

1141
01:39:02,870 --> 01:39:04,064
I'm gonna kill you both!

1142
01:39:04,872 --> 01:39:06,999
- I'm gonna kill you both!
- Fuck you!

1143
01:39:08,442 --> 01:39:10,774
- Take the gun, Les!
- Fuck you!

1144
01:39:12,546 --> 01:39:13,478
Fuck you!

1145
01:42:10,858 --> 01:42:13,759
A bizarre incident
was reported by police today.

1146
01:42:13,894 --> 01:42:17,352
Over $15,000 has been
anonymously returned...

1147
01:42:17,531 --> 01:42:21,900
over 27 convenience stores,
9-9 and grocery marts...

1148
01:42:22,035 --> 01:42:25,368
with over $10,000 returned
to a Park and Savings Bank...

1149
01:42:25,539 --> 01:42:29,031
in repayment for the rush out
robberies that occurred last week.

1150
01:42:29,176 --> 01:42:32,077
It appears, the robbers
experienced remorse and sent...

1151
01:42:32,146 --> 01:42:35,047
the exact amount of stolen
cash back to each establishment.

1152
01:42:35,182 --> 01:42:38,208
The robbers even sent extra money
to two persons...

1153
01:42:38,285 --> 01:42:44,914
who were hurt during the course of the crime:
An older Asian woman and a savings and loan manager.
