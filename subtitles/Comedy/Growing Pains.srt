00:21:18,171 --> 00:21:20,237
Uhh. Thank you.

496
00:21:20,239 --> 00:21:22,173
So it looked like you lost your balance.

497
00:21:22,175 --> 00:21:23,741
I was just tired.

498
00:21:23,743 --> 00:21:26,410
You're not just tired, Tom. You're sick.

499
00:21:26,412 --> 00:21:28,479
Now, were you dizzy, lightheaded,

500
00:21:28,481 --> 00:21:30,815
or was it something else?

501
00:21:30,817 --> 00:21:33,284
It was my vision. I had floaters.

502
00:21:33,286 --> 00:21:34,685
Huh.

503
00:21:34,687 --> 00:21:36,287
It sounds like possible retinopathy

504
00:21:36,289 --> 00:21:37,555
associated with the malabsorption.

505
00:21:37,557 --> 00:21:39,590
- Yep.
- Addison's disease.

506
00:21:39,592 --> 00:21:40,724
I don't think so.

507
00:21:40,726 --> 00:21:41,725
He's got none of the skin darkening

508
00:21:41,727 --> 00:21:43,260
that goes with Addison's.

509
00:21:43,262 --> 00:21:45,262
Let's find his tooth
and get him to the hospital.

510
00:21:45,264 --> 00:21:46,597
All right.

511
00:21:46,599 --> 00:21:49,200
- No, no, no.
- Tom. No. You sit.

512
00:21:49,202 --> 00:21:50,768
You're forgetting something.

513
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:52,937
- What's that?
- Beulah's mastitis.

514
00:21:52,939 --> 00:21:56,273
I don't just walk out
on my patients, guys.

515
00:21:56,275 --> 00:21:58,676
You guys are both very similar.

516
00:21:58,678 --> 00:22:00,277
All right, here's what's gonna happen.

517
00:22:00,279 --> 00:22:02,046
Divya, you find his tooth,
but don't touch the root.

518
00:22:02,048 --> 00:22:03,981
That can disturb cells
that attach it to the bone.

519
00:22:03,983 --> 00:22:05,950
The sooner we get it back
in the socket, the better.

520
00:22:05,952 --> 00:22:07,084
Got it.

521
00:22:07,086 --> 00:22:11,489
Tom, I'll treat Beulah.

522
00:22:11,491 --> 00:22:13,324
You're a people doctor,
Hank. It's different.

523
00:22:13,326 --> 00:22:14,992
All right, so talk me through it.

524
00:22:14,994 --> 00:22:17,795
Well, you need to give her
an antibiotic injection.

525
00:22:17,797 --> 00:22:18,963
That's not so different.

526
00:22:18,965 --> 00:22:20,331
Into her teat canal.

527
00:22:20,333 --> 00:22:21,599
- That's different.
- Yeah.

528
00:22:21,601 --> 00:22:24,001
Okay... Found it.

529
00:22:24,003 --> 00:22:25,135
Great.
[Chuckles]

530
00:22:25,137 --> 00:22:27,271
But it is... it's filthy.

531
00:22:27,273 --> 00:22:29,807
So we need to rinse it off
with milk, not water, right?

532
00:22:29,809 --> 00:22:31,575
Right. Milk has a more neutral PH.

533
00:22:31,577 --> 00:22:32,877
That works out perfectly.

534
00:22:32,879 --> 00:22:35,412
Beulah needs a milking
before the injection anyway.

535
00:22:35,414 --> 00:22:38,582
Uh... [Cow moos]

536
00:22:40,552 --> 00:22:42,653
We're eating lunch here?

537
00:22:42,655 --> 00:22:44,822
[Sighs] Yeah.

538
00:22:44,824 --> 00:22:46,290
People say they have a great burger.

539
00:22:46,292 --> 00:22:48,225
So anywhere? Okay.

540
00:22:48,227 --> 00:22:51,328
Oh...

541
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:53,564
This is where Van Dyke
was drinking last night.

542
00:22:53,566 --> 00:22:56,634
All right...

543
00:22:56,636 --> 00:22:58,736
I'm convinced there's more to his story,

544
00:22:58,738 --> 00:23:00,905
and I don't know why,
but I need to know what it is.

545
00:23:00,907 --> 00:23:02,740
I know why.

546
00:23:02,742 --> 00:23:04,508
Because you want to see
the best in people.

547
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:07,211
And because at a time
when we need doctors,

548
00:23:07,213 --> 00:23:08,512
he is a known commodity.

549
00:23:08,514 --> 00:23:11,181
The devil you know.

550
00:23:11,183 --> 00:23:13,083
But don't forget, devils are evil,

551
00:23:13,085 --> 00:23:15,786
and evil should be punished.

552
00:23:15,788 --> 00:23:18,289
Whoa.

553
00:23:18,291 --> 00:23:20,391
Is this how you're gonna be with our kids?

554
00:23:20,393 --> 00:23:23,460
No excuses, take your medicine...

555
00:23:23,462 --> 00:23:25,229
Kill 'em all, let God sort 'em out.

556
00:23:25,231 --> 00:23:26,330
Rah, rah, rah!

557
00:23:26,332 --> 00:23:27,998
Well, that's how I was raised.

558
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,400
By a four-star general.

559
00:23:29,402 --> 00:23:30,834
And look how I turned out.

560
00:23:30,836 --> 00:23:33,103
You are pretty awesome.

561
00:23:33,105 --> 00:23:35,639
Thank you.

562
00:23:35,641 --> 00:23:38,042
So is this how you're
gonna be with our kids...

563
00:23:38,044 --> 00:23:39,276
a big softie?

564
00:23:39,278 --> 00:23:42,646
I am not a softie. I'm compassionate.

565
00:23:42,648 --> 00:23:43,881
Well, compassion is for charity,

566
00:23:43,883 --> 00:23:45,316
not for child-rearing.

567
00:23:45,318 --> 00:23:47,851
So you better be prepared
to step up, mister,

568
00:23:47,853 --> 00:23:50,554
because I am not gonna
always be the bad cop.

569
00:23:50,556 --> 00:23:52,156
Yes, ma'am.

570
00:23:52,158 --> 00:23:53,991
You joke, but maybe there are some things

571
00:23:53,993 --> 00:23:55,826
we need to talk about
before we get married.

572
00:23:55,828 --> 00:23:57,061
I'm sure there are,

573
00:23:57,063 --> 00:23:58,829
but how to discipline
our imaginary children

574
00:23:58,831 --> 00:24:00,497
is probably one
we can back-burner for now.

575
00:24:00,499 --> 00:24:02,132
You are so avoiding the issue.

576
00:24:02,134 --> 00:24:04,435
I'm not avoi... they're imaginary.

577
00:24:04,437 --> 00:24:07,538
I'm talking about Van Dyke.
Hank said handle it.

578
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:09,273
I am. I'm...

579
00:24:09,275 --> 00:24:10,708
God, I know we're from Passaic.

580
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:12,810
I don't think he meant,
like, <i>handle it</i> handle it.

581
00:24:12,812 --> 00:24:15,145
No, he meant make a decision,
which you did,

582
00:24:15,147 --> 00:24:17,081
only now you're second-guessing it.

583
00:24:17,083 --> 00:24:20,317
Don't.

584
00:24:20,319 --> 00:24:22,853
[Cow moos]
Uh-huh.

585
00:24:25,523 --> 00:24:26,991
Like that.

586
00:24:32,464 --> 00:24:34,164
Ah.

587
00:24:37,969 --> 00:24:40,204
Ehh...

588
00:24:40,206 --> 00:24:43,173
[Chuckles] Ow.

589
00:24:43,175 --> 00:24:46,577
Grab the teat...

590
00:24:46,579 --> 00:24:48,812
Good.

591
00:24:57,155 --> 00:24:58,989
Oh, I see. Okay.

592
00:25:02,027 --> 00:25:06,230
Okay. Cheapest retainer ever made.

593
00:25:06,232 --> 00:25:07,665
That should hold the tooth in place

594
00:25:07,667 --> 00:25:09,266
till we get you examined at the hospital.

595
00:25:09,268 --> 00:25:11,702
Plus, Tom, you might want
to up your brushing time.

596
00:25:11,704 --> 00:25:13,404
You've got a little gingivitis in there.

597
00:25:13,406 --> 00:25:15,339
Jeez, Hank. [Chuckles]

598
00:25:15,341 --> 00:25:17,408
What kind of medicine doesn't he practice?

599
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:22,179
Can I help you?

600
00:25:24,049 --> 00:25:26,216
Yeah. Yeah, actually.

601
00:25:26,218 --> 00:25:28,585
We would like two IPAs,

602
00:25:28,587 --> 00:25:30,521
uh, two Dive burgers, one with cheese.

603
00:25:30,523 --> 00:25:33,157
And was this guy in here last night?

604
00:25:33,159 --> 00:25:36,226
[Scoffs] I'll say.

605
00:25:36,228 --> 00:25:38,262
And there we were, the two of us,

606
00:25:38,264 --> 00:25:40,264
out in the field.

607
00:25:40,266 --> 00:25:45,035
The hot summer rain soaked us to the skin.

608
00:25:45,037 --> 00:25:48,305
Oh, my God, it hurts
just to think about it.

609
00:25:48,307 --> 00:25:51,375
Why, Ronnie, why?

610

[Clears throat]

you're gonna have to switch
to a big-boy drink.

Unh! Oh!

[Grunts, groans]

00:26:21,906 --> 00:26:24,374

[Sighs] 'Cause we're not friends.

Of course we are.

he's a hopeless romantic is what he is.

635

You have to hire him back.

[Horns honking]

637
00:27:13,692 --> 00:27:15,292
If this is what a bitter divorce gets me,

638
00:27:15,294 --> 00:27:17,394
maybe I shouldn't be so bitter.

639
00:27:17,396 --> 00:27:19,396
Exactly. This fight is
letting your ex-wife

640
00:27:19,398 --> 00:27:21,565
take your health too.

641
00:27:21,567 --> 00:27:23,167
Well, she should get something.

642
00:27:23,169 --> 00:27:25,803
I wasn't the perfect husband.

643
00:27:25,805 --> 00:27:27,671
Always running out to see patients,

bringing them home without asking...

Adopting them.

646
00:27:31,644 --> 00:27:35,579
What she did was unforgivable.

647
00:27:35,581 --> 00:27:40,117
Of course I fought like an alley cat.

648
00:27:40,119 --> 00:27:42,820
If only we could all be
as selfless as guide horses.

Or dogs.

Hey, Tom, did that farm
just train horses for the blind?

What do you mean?

652
00:27:52,464 --> 00:27:54,798
I mean, are you asking
if they work with other animals,

653
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,266
[begins slurring]
or other medical conditions or...

Tom, you're slurring your words.

655
00:27:58,270 --> 00:28:00,304
Maybe the cow hit a facial nerve.

656
00:28:00,306 --> 00:28:01,839
It looks like Bell's palsy.

657
00:28:01,841 --> 00:28:04,708
Can you wrinkle your forehead?

658
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:05,976

which caused the stroke.

823
00:35:44,708 --> 00:35:46,241
So how'd I get it?

824
00:35:46,243 --> 00:35:48,310
It's found in soil.
[Chuckles]

825
00:35:48,312 --> 00:35:49,878
Well, I work with farm animals,

826
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,613
so that should be easy to avoid.

827
00:35:51,615 --> 00:35:53,248
Look, Tom, it's rare.

828
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:54,883
And you're gonna be on
antibiotics for at least a year,

829
00:35:54,885 --> 00:35:58,487
so hopefully it won't recur.

830
00:35:58,489 --> 00:36:01,656
Thanks... Both of you.

831
00:36:01,658 --> 00:36:04,059
You are seriously good human beings.

832
00:36:04,061 --> 00:36:05,727
And coming from a guy who prefers animals,

833
00:36:05,729 --> 00:36:06,928
that's saying a lot.

834
00:36:06,930 --> 00:36:09,698
[Chuckles]
You're a good person too.

835
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:11,366
And I am glad that you changed your mind

836
00:36:11,368 --> 00:36:12,634
about fighting your ex-wife.

837
00:36:12,636 --> 00:36:14,136
What do you mean?

838
00:36:14,138 --> 00:36:16,538
Well, you said that
you were going to stop,

839
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:17,973
that it wasn't worth it.

840
00:36:17,975 --> 00:36:20,742
Yeah, that's when we thought
it was stress-induced.

841
00:36:20,744 --> 00:36:21,943
You just said it's bacterial.

842
00:36:21,945 --> 00:36:24,146
It is, but the lesson here...

843
00:36:24,148 --> 00:36:25,514
the lesson here is that you can't avoid

844
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:27,616
random crappy soil bacteria.

845
00:36:27,618 --> 00:36:29,184
Once I'm back up on my feet,

846
00:36:29,186 --> 00:36:31,186
I'm going with both barrels at that harpy.

847
00:36:31,188 --> 00:36:33,755
- Tom?
- One barrel?

848
00:36:33,757 --> 00:36:36,358
All right, no barrels.

849
00:36:39,862 --> 00:36:43,298
Thank you guys for coming.

850
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:45,133
[Sighs]

851
00:36:45,135 --> 00:36:47,536
Thanks for handling the Van Dyke thing.

852
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:49,538
You done good.

853
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:51,706
You're welcome.

854
00:36:51,708 --> 00:36:55,110
I... honestly, I was a little nervous

855
00:36:55,112 --> 00:36:57,112
when you said, "handle it."

856
00:36:57,114 --> 00:36:59,781
I thought you just wanted me to fire him.

857
00:36:59,783 --> 00:37:04,119
I wanted you to handle it, which you did.

858
00:37:04,121 --> 00:37:05,720
One of these days, I really need

859
00:37:05,722 --> 00:37:07,722
to stop worrying so much
about what you think.

860
00:37:07,724 --> 00:37:10,725
No, you don't.
[Chuckles]

861
00:37:10,727 --> 00:37:12,994
- You doing a reading?
- Yeah.

862
00:37:12,996 --> 00:37:14,362
What the hell is Thessalonians, anyway?

863
00:37:14,364 --> 00:37:16,398
I have no idea.

864
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:20,335
[Clears throat] Um... Oh...

865
00:37:20,337 --> 00:37:23,371
When Pam broke up with me,

866
00:37:23,373 --> 00:37:25,173
I was left with two things:

867
00:37:25,175 --> 00:37:26,942
Her memory...

868
00:37:26,944 --> 00:37:31,379
and... her rabbit.

869
00:37:31,381 --> 00:37:35,584
In fact, at first,
Ronnie was just a memory of Pam.

870
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:39,554
But eventually, Pam faded.

871
00:37:39,556 --> 00:37:43,391
And today...

872
00:37:43,393 --> 00:37:46,027
Oh...

873
00:37:46,029 --> 00:37:47,162
It's cool, man.

874
00:37:47,164 --> 00:37:48,997
Today... [Clears throat]

875
00:37:48,999 --> 00:37:52,100
Ronnie has become her own memory.

876
00:37:52,102 --> 00:37:57,405
And so I return you now, Ronnie,

877
00:37:57,407 --> 00:37:59,407
from whence you came.

878
00:37:59,409 --> 00:38:01,610
Bunnies don't come from the ocean.

879
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:02,611
Just roll with it.

880
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:04,579
Is... is this even legal?

881
00:38:04,581 --> 00:38:05,847
Evan has a permit.

882
00:38:05,849 --> 00:38:07,115
No, I don't.

883
00:38:07,117 --> 00:38:08,517
- You said you applied for one.
- I did.

884
00:38:08,519 --> 00:38:12,454
In six to eight weeks,
we'll see if it was approved.

885
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:14,756
Hey, Evan, I want to thank you

886
00:38:14,758 --> 00:38:16,825
for being a good boss.

887
00:38:16,827 --> 00:38:21,496
But more importantly,

888
00:38:21,498 --> 00:38:23,865
for being a friend.

889
00:38:27,169 --> 00:38:29,704
Absolutely, man.

890
00:38:29,706 --> 00:38:30,805
All right.

891
00:38:30,807 --> 00:38:34,175
So, uh... Even though I didn't...

892
00:38:34,177 --> 00:38:36,211
I didn't really know Ronnie very well,

893
00:38:36,213 --> 00:38:38,113
I thought I'd just, uh...

894
00:38:38,115 --> 00:38:41,082
"we do not want you to be unaware,"

895
00:38:41,084 --> 00:38:43,018
"brothers and sisters..."

896
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:44,386
Uh, I'm sorry to interrupt,
but there's a lifeguard

897
00:38:44,388 --> 00:38:46,922
staring at us.

898
00:38:46,924 --> 00:38:48,490
Is there a problem?

899
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:51,026
Only if we get caught.
This is technically illegal.

900
00:38:51,028 --> 00:38:52,093
It's a lifeguard. What's he gonna do,

901
00:38:52,095 --> 00:38:53,428
make us take swim lessons?

902
00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:55,797
Or point us out to a cop,
like he's doing now.

903
00:38:55,799 --> 00:38:57,799
My father's running for senate.

904
00:38:57,801 --> 00:38:59,134
I can't get arrested for this.

905
00:38:59,136 --> 00:39:00,201
All right, scatter. Everyone scatter.

906
00:39:00,203 --> 00:39:01,870
But casually... casually scatter.

907
00:39:01,872 --> 00:39:04,472
[Siren wails]
Come on!

908
00:39:04,474 --> 00:39:06,908
Forget casually, just run!

909
00:39:08,644 --> 00:39:10,879
Okay.

910
00:39:10,881 --> 00:39:13,214
Good-bye, Ronnie!

911
00:39:15,952 --> 00:39:18,620
[Shredder whirring]

912
00:39:20,423 --> 00:39:23,058
Yep.

913
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:24,893
I thought we were going out.

914
00:39:24,895 --> 00:39:26,561
We are. I thought
we could get a drink first.

915
00:39:26,563 --> 00:39:28,430
- With Boris?
- Uh, no.

916
00:39:28,432 --> 00:39:30,632
Boris and Dmitry are
celebrating on Boris' yacht.

917
00:39:30,634 --> 00:39:32,601
Apparently, international deals call for

918
00:39:32,603 --> 00:39:34,469
international waters.

919
00:39:34,471 --> 00:39:36,671
So where are we going?

920
00:39:36,673 --> 00:39:38,406
You'll see.

921
00:39:45,815 --> 00:39:47,816
[Laughs]

922
00:39:47,818 --> 00:39:50,852
- Narnia?
- No, not Narnia.

923
00:39:50,854 --> 00:39:52,921
I feel like I might be hot.

924
00:39:52,923 --> 00:39:55,357
Trust me. You're gonna be fine.

925
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:57,792
But it's summer.

926
00:39:57,794 --> 00:40:00,128
Not in there.

927
00:40:00,130 --> 00:40:03,264
[Chuckles, shivers]

928
00:40:03,266 --> 00:40:06,368
- It's chilly in here.
- I know.

929
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:09,004
All right, here we go.

930
00:40:09,006 --> 00:40:11,473
[Light switch clicks]

931
00:40:11,475 --> 00:40:14,342
[Laughs, gasps]

932
00:40:14,344 --> 00:40:18,179
- Holy...
- I know.

933
00:40:18,181 --> 00:40:19,581
This used to be a meat locker

934
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:21,783
till Boris had it converted for Dmitry.

935
00:40:21,785 --> 00:40:24,486
So then why are we in here,
and they're out on a boat?

936
00:40:24,488 --> 00:40:26,721
Because given his liver and his diabetes,

937
00:40:26,723 --> 00:40:29,724
Dmitry wisely chose the fish
over the vodka.

938
00:40:29,726 --> 00:40:32,127
But that's no reason we can't enjoy it.

939
00:40:32,129 --> 00:40:33,895
Please, step up to my bar.

940
00:40:33,897 --> 00:40:35,030
[Chuckles]

941
00:40:35,032 --> 00:40:37,732
You, uh... you have a favorite?

942
00:40:37,734 --> 00:40:40,702
Um... Oh.

943
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:43,071
You can't buy this.

944
00:40:43,073 --> 00:40:44,539
This is what Khrushchev used to serve

945
00:40:44,541 --> 00:40:46,207
to visiting dignitaries.

946
00:40:46,209 --> 00:40:47,942
Yeah?

947
00:40:47,944 --> 00:40:49,644
So let's dignify it.
