1
00:00:02,361 --> 00:00:05,389
<i>Felix (from other room):
Oh, yes. Yes. Oh, yes.</i>

2
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:07,160
Oh, yes. Yeah, that's it, that's it.

3
00:00:07,161 --> 00:00:07,883
Almost there.

4
00:00:07,884 --> 00:00:10,049
Oh, God, yes!

5
00:00:11,485 --> 00:00:13,254
Yes...

6
00:00:13,255 --> 00:00:15,456
that's the spot.

7
00:00:15,457 --> 00:00:19,760
I thought I heard sex noises,
but this is equally disturbing.

8
00:00:19,761 --> 00:00:22,263
I'm shooting an ad campaign
for a restaurant chain.

9
00:00:22,264 --> 00:00:23,791
Wouldn't you like to try
this delicious sundae?

10
00:00:23,792 --> 00:00:26,334
- I'd love to.
- You can't.

11
00:00:26,335 --> 00:00:28,369
It's not edible... it's a little bit

12
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:30,371
of food-styling trickery. You see,

13
00:00:30,372 --> 00:00:31,839
the ice cream is actually just lard,

14
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,874
and the chocolate sauce is motor oil.

15
00:00:33,875 --> 00:00:36,476
Later, I have to dispose
of the sundae at Pep Boys.

16
00:00:37,244 --> 00:00:39,180
This is so exciting. I love learning

17
00:00:39,181 --> 00:00:40,915
all the little
behind-the-scenes tricks.

18
00:00:40,916 --> 00:00:43,784
If you really find it
interesting, I could use some help.

19
00:00:43,785 --> 00:00:45,720
I have some money in the
budget. Do you think Oscar

20
00:00:45,721 --> 00:00:47,021
could spare his assistant for the day?

21
00:00:47,022 --> 00:00:48,356
This is actually my day off.

22
00:00:48,357 --> 00:00:49,924
I'm just here for the free WI-FI.

23
00:00:49,925 --> 00:00:51,792
Great! You can help me
with the hamburger photo.

24
00:00:51,793 --> 00:00:52,994
Oh.

25
00:00:52,995 --> 00:00:55,162
Step one: select the perfect bun.

26
00:00:55,163 --> 00:00:57,832
Now, our featured bun must
be perfectly symmetrical

27
00:00:57,833 --> 00:00:59,500
with a golden crust.

28
00:00:59,501 --> 00:01:01,435
Okay.

29
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:03,004
It doesn't shy away from
attention, but it knows

30
00:01:03,005 --> 00:01:04,238
it's not the center of the sandwich.

31
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,674
Got it. Oh!

32
00:01:06,675 --> 00:01:10,845
It's the kind of bun that's
comfortable at a bar, or a Bar Mitzvah.

33
00:01:10,846 --> 00:01:12,338
I'm done.

34
00:01:12,498 --> 00:01:14,548
Yeah, you can talk all you
want... you're paying me.

35
00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:16,751
That I am.

36
00:01:16,752 --> 00:01:19,185
- Good luck.
- Oh!

37
00:01:20,454 --> 00:01:22,256
<i>- Hey, Felix.
- Oh, gentlemen. Welcome home.</i>

38
00:01:22,257 --> 00:01:24,592
- How was Atlantic City?
- It was all kind of a blur.

39
00:01:24,593 --> 00:01:27,128
Lots of drinking and gambling
and bouncers shouting,

40
00:01:27,129 --> 00:01:29,263
"No touching."

41
00:01:29,264 --> 00:01:32,600
When I drink bourbon, I like
to touch people's... teeth.

42
00:01:32,601 --> 00:01:35,503
At least you got to drink.

43
00:01:35,504 --> 00:01:37,304
This juice cleanse is killing me.

44
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:39,774
It's killing all of us...
you smell like a hamster cage.

45
00:01:39,775 --> 00:01:44,011
All right, Oscar, it's time
for me to be your agent again.

46
00:01:44,012 --> 00:01:46,247
You had your fun, but
now it's time to...

47
00:01:46,248 --> 00:01:48,249
Drink beer in my underwear?

48
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:50,351
Sit your ass down and
start writing that book.

49
00:01:50,352 --> 00:01:52,953
Wow, I wasn't even close.

50
00:01:52,954 --> 00:01:54,622
Oscar, you're writing another
book? That's wonderful.

51
00:01:54,623 --> 00:01:56,524
Oh, it's no big deal...
I'm just ghostwriting

52
00:01:56,525 --> 00:01:58,826
this autobiography for a
retired baseball player.

53
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:01,429
I just crank 'em out
and make some fast cash.

54
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:02,763
Oh, yeah, he does work fast.

55
00:02:02,764 --> 00:02:03,998
He goes through those books

56
00:02:03,999 --> 00:02:07,368
like seaweed through a human colon.

57
00:02:07,369 --> 00:02:09,737
I miss solid food so much.

58
00:02:09,738 --> 00:02:12,840
Yeah, I could use a nap.
Do you mind if I crash here?

59
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:15,109
My wife thinks I'm still
in Atlantic City, and...

60
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:17,912
I'd like to keep it that way.

61
00:02:17,913 --> 00:02:19,346
I'm gonna be kind of busy, Roy.

62
00:02:19,347 --> 00:02:22,083
Yeah, okay. You know, I can...
I can just sleep in the park.

63
00:02:22,084 --> 00:02:23,484
Yeah. At the park,

64
00:02:23,485 --> 00:02:25,419
no one nags you, or says they've lost

65
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:28,155
all sexual desire
because your body feels,

66
00:02:28,156 --> 00:02:32,959
quote, "like a bag of
wet sand dipped in hair."

67
00:02:33,561 --> 00:02:35,196
Take a nap here, Roy.

68
00:02:35,197 --> 00:02:36,797
All right.

69
00:02:36,798 --> 00:02:38,966
Your friend drops an
emotional bomb like that

70
00:02:38,967 --> 00:02:40,634
and you just let him walk away?

71
00:02:40,635 --> 00:02:42,470
- That's the polite thing to do.
- Absolutely.

72
00:02:42,471 --> 00:02:44,405
Can't you see, he's got some

73
00:02:44,406 --> 00:02:46,040
deep-seated feelings
that need to be dug into.

74
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:49,143
No, no, no, no. Don't
dig. You always do that.

75
00:02:49,144 --> 00:02:51,322
- What are you talking about?
- You treat every conversation

76
00:02:51,323 --> 00:02:52,213
like it's therapy.

77
00:02:52,214 --> 00:02:53,447
You root around people's heads

78
00:02:53,448 --> 00:02:54,915
and get them all mixed up.

79
00:02:54,916 --> 00:02:56,717
(chuckles): 18 therapists in 15 years...

80
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:58,853
I think I know a little
bit about psychology.

81
00:02:58,854 --> 00:03:03,958
Not everybody wants to share the
painful details of their lives.

82
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:05,326
Oh, really?

83
00:03:05,327 --> 00:03:08,795
Heard of Facebook?

84
00:03:09,597 --> 00:03:11,398
I found the perfect buns.

85
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:12,533
I thought it was your day off?

86
00:03:12,534 --> 00:03:14,034
I'm helping Felix with a project.

87
00:03:14,035 --> 00:03:16,070
Ah, yes, Dani, very
nice. I like this one.

88
00:03:16,071 --> 00:03:17,471
Now we just have to modulate

89
00:03:17,472 --> 00:03:18,772
the clumping of these sesame seeds.

90
00:03:18,773 --> 00:03:20,641
Why have they all congregated over here?

91
00:03:20,642 --> 00:03:23,042
What do these seeds know
that these seeds don't know?

92
00:03:23,777 --> 00:03:26,245
I will get you tweezers.

93
00:03:27,581 --> 00:03:29,083
And I will get you pliers

94
00:03:29,084 --> 00:03:31,884
to remove the stick from his ass.

95
00:03:50,801 --> 00:03:55,031
Subtitle sync and corrections
by awaqeded for www.addic7ed.com.

96
00:04:00,516 --> 00:04:02,518
There he is. Hey, Murph.

97
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:03,953
I see you brought some writing juice.

98
00:04:03,954 --> 00:04:06,055
Yeah. Sorry I'm late.

99
00:04:06,056 --> 00:04:07,823
This girl recognized
me at the liquor store.

100
00:04:07,824 --> 00:04:09,525
Guess she's a big baseball fan.

101
00:04:09,526 --> 00:04:12,395
So I had to stop and do the
whole polite meet a fan thing.

102
00:04:12,396 --> 00:04:13,763
You slept with her.

103
00:04:13,764 --> 00:04:15,631
Yeah.

104
00:04:15,632 --> 00:04:17,967
Marcus Murphy does not kiss and tell.

105
00:04:17,968 --> 00:04:20,368
Well, she does. It's
trending on Twitter.

106
00:04:21,437 --> 00:04:23,606
"Made it to home base
with Marcus Murphy.

107
00:04:23,607 --> 00:04:28,044
#bestsexever #majorleaguepenis"

108
00:04:28,045 --> 00:04:29,845
Hey, it was a team effort.

109
00:04:29,846 --> 00:04:32,248
We're all just out there trying
to have the best sex we can.

110
00:04:32,249 --> 00:04:35,016
Or any sex we can.

111
00:04:35,885 --> 00:04:36,986
So, how's our book coming?

112
00:04:36,987 --> 00:04:38,587
Great. I haven't started it yet,

113
00:04:38,588 --> 00:04:40,723
but I know everything there
is to know about your career.

114
00:04:40,724 --> 00:04:42,992
Seven all-star teams,
three Gold Gloves,

115
00:04:42,993 --> 00:04:45,294
two sex tapes; both went platinum.

116
00:04:45,295 --> 00:04:46,929
Yeah.

117
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:48,064
I can't take all the credit.

118
00:04:48,065 --> 00:04:50,999
Those girls showed a lot of hustle.

119
00:04:51,634 --> 00:04:52,802
Just passing through. Hello.

120
00:04:52,803 --> 00:04:54,136
Pretend I'm not here.

121
00:04:54,137 --> 00:04:55,304
Murph, this is Felix.

122
00:04:55,305 --> 00:04:57,106
He's not here.

123
00:04:57,107 --> 00:04:58,741
What are you, some kind of photographer?

124
00:04:58,742 --> 00:05:01,909
Hmm, technically, I am
many kinds of photographer.

125
00:05:02,945 --> 00:05:04,346
Currently, I am doing
some commercial work.

126
00:05:04,347 --> 00:05:06,048
Although, my first love is portraiture,

127
00:05:06,049 --> 00:05:08,716
or as I call it, illuminating the soul.

128
00:05:10,052 --> 00:05:11,187
He's gonna keep talking as long

129
00:05:11,188 --> 00:05:12,755
as you keep making eye contact.

130
00:05:12,756 --> 00:05:15,491
Yes, any portrait can tell
you what a person looks like,

131
00:05:15,492 --> 00:05:17,460
but by manipulating color
and light and shadow,

132
00:05:17,461 --> 00:05:21,063
<i>I can tell you who a person is.</i>

133
00:05:21,064 --> 00:05:23,466
Whoa. Whoa, hey, Oscar,

134
00:05:23,467 --> 00:05:25,401
don't we need a picture
of me for the book flap?

135
00:05:25,402 --> 00:05:27,470
I'm thinking casual
setting, natural light.

136
00:05:27,471 --> 00:05:29,805
Felix, I have a deadline.

137
00:05:29,806 --> 00:05:31,006
I can't keep wasting time.

138
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:32,508
(phone chimes) I've got work to do.

139
00:05:32,509 --> 00:05:34,410
Oh, there's my lunch.

140
00:05:34,411 --> 00:05:37,146
All right, you guys have ten minutes.

141
00:05:37,147 --> 00:05:39,048
Oh, no, I've got to call my bookie.

142
00:05:39,049 --> 00:05:40,449
You guys have 20 minutes!

143
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:42,384
Just see what I'm working with here.

144
00:05:42,385 --> 00:05:43,619
Oh, yes, yes.

145
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:45,321
Structure's good. Okay.

146
00:05:45,322 --> 00:05:47,389
Photoshop will take care of
that little scar on the earlobe.

147
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:49,391
How can you see that? It's so tiny.

148
00:05:49,392 --> 00:05:51,060
Oh, as a professional,
I'm trained to notice

149
00:05:51,061 --> 00:05:52,428
the most minute detail.

150
00:05:52,429 --> 00:05:53,729
In fact, tell whoever
gave you that hickey

151
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:55,229
she's got a loose crown.

152
00:05:56,565 --> 00:05:58,734
Pickup for Madison.

153
00:05:58,735 --> 00:06:00,002
Oh, hey, neighbor.

154
00:06:00,003 --> 00:06:02,104
- I thought this might be for you.
- Yep.

155
00:06:02,105 --> 00:06:05,040
I'm sure you're wondering
why I got a job here.

156
00:06:05,041 --> 00:06:07,476
Not really.

157
00:06:07,477 --> 00:06:10,079
Well, my jewelry business
hasn't really taken off yet.

158
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,448
You know, it started as just a-a hobby,

159
00:06:12,449 --> 00:06:14,083
something I did for "mad money".

160
00:06:14,084 --> 00:06:16,385
But now I need to make "rent money,"

161
00:06:16,386 --> 00:06:18,320
so... (chuckles) look at me!

162
00:06:18,321 --> 00:06:19,788
I'm a working girl.

163
00:06:19,789 --> 00:06:21,891
Scrappy working girl in the city.

164
00:06:21,892 --> 00:06:24,894
Plus, it's free
advertising for my designs.

165
00:06:24,895 --> 00:06:26,162
So it's all good.

166
00:06:26,163 --> 00:06:27,863
No, it's all great.

167
00:06:27,864 --> 00:06:30,032
I'm sorry, what did you ask?

168
00:06:30,033 --> 00:06:31,167
I didn't.

169
00:06:31,168 --> 00:06:32,334
Oh.

170
00:06:32,335 --> 00:06:34,103
Oh, I forgot your utensils.

171
00:06:34,104 --> 00:06:35,604
I will be right back.

172
00:06:35,605 --> 00:06:37,071
Oh!

173
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:41,577
Living the dream.

174
00:06:41,578 --> 00:06:43,012
(shutter clicking) Yeah,
that's it, that's it.

175
00:06:43,013 --> 00:06:44,598
Back straight, chin out,
like a proud meerkat.

176
00:06:44,599 --> 00:06:45,447
Yes, yes.

177
00:06:45,448 --> 00:06:46,582
Who's that coming?

178
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:47,716
Oh, it's my friend the gazelle.

179
00:06:47,717 --> 00:06:49,518
Yeah?

180
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:51,887
Huh, that is an interesting expression.

181
00:06:51,888 --> 00:06:54,423
Uh, sorry, I just don't know
what a gazelle looks like,

182
00:06:54,424 --> 00:06:56,559
so I'm picturing a skinny moose.

183
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,160
No, it's not that.

184
00:06:58,161 --> 00:06:59,895
It just, it looks like
you're pondering something.

185
00:06:59,896 --> 00:07:01,931
I guess I'm thinking about the book.

186
00:07:01,932 --> 00:07:03,532
What about it?

187
00:07:03,533 --> 00:07:04,900
I don't know. It just seems so weird

188
00:07:04,901 --> 00:07:06,535
to have your whole life

189
00:07:06,536 --> 00:07:08,170
boiled down to stats and game scores.

190
00:07:08,171 --> 00:07:09,338
Yes.

191
00:07:09,339 --> 00:07:11,173
Interesting. Anyone ever tell you

192
00:07:11,174 --> 00:07:12,942
that you have unexpected depth?

193
00:07:12,943 --> 00:07:14,310
My English teacher, Ms. Russell,

194
00:07:14,311 --> 00:07:16,045
said something like that in high school.

195
00:07:16,046 --> 00:07:17,846
At first, I thought she was
just trying to get into my pants,

196
00:07:17,847 --> 00:07:19,915
but it turns out, she
also liked my poetry.

197
00:07:19,916 --> 00:07:21,684
Poet, I knew it.

198
00:07:21,685 --> 00:07:22,885
The camera does not lie.

199
00:07:22,886 --> 00:07:24,553
Ah, I messed around a little bit.

200
00:07:24,554 --> 00:07:26,622
I really enjoyed it, but
my dad said it was stupid,

201
00:07:26,623 --> 00:07:28,357
and that I had to focus on baseball.

202
00:07:28,358 --> 00:07:30,726
Yeah, so you spent hours
training, sacrificing.

203
00:07:30,727 --> 00:07:33,395
All to make your father
happy, but no one ever asked

204
00:07:33,396 --> 00:07:34,797
what made you happy.

205
00:07:34,798 --> 00:07:36,398
This is spooky.

206
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:38,367
It's like you're right inside here.

207
00:07:38,368 --> 00:07:40,135
Quick, what animal am I thinking of?

208
00:07:40,136 --> 00:07:41,237
I'm not a psychic.

209
00:07:41,238 --> 00:07:42,703
A meerkat.

210
00:07:43,339 --> 00:07:44,573
We just talked about them.

211
00:07:44,574 --> 00:07:45,975
Look, the point is,

212
00:07:45,976 --> 00:07:47,610
baseball is only a small
part of who you are.

213
00:07:47,611 --> 00:07:49,578
Yeah, exactly. I wrote a bunch of poems

214
00:07:49,579 --> 00:07:51,193
about breaking up with
my first girlfriend,

215
00:07:51,194 --> 00:07:52,114
Ms. Nicholson.

216
00:07:52,115 --> 00:07:54,116
My math teacher.

217
00:07:54,117 --> 00:07:57,019
We had very different
high school experiences.

218
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:59,154
But I would love to hear those poems.

219
00:07:59,155 --> 00:08:00,322
Nah, nah.

220
00:08:00,323 --> 00:08:01,657
It's embarrassing.

221
00:08:01,658 --> 00:08:02,925
Oh, please, Murph,

222
00:08:02,926 --> 00:08:04,159
this is a safe place.

223
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,463
I am zipping us into a tent

224
00:08:07,464 --> 00:08:11,734
of unconditional emotional support.

225
00:08:11,735 --> 00:08:13,668
Go ahead, I'm listening.

226
00:08:13,969 --> 00:08:16,872
Careful.

227
00:08:16,873 --> 00:08:18,974
Oh, here you go.

228
00:08:18,975 --> 00:08:21,243
- Sorry for the delay.
- Oh, no need to explain.

229
00:08:21,244 --> 00:08:24,013
My manager insisted I
remake your sandwiches.

230
00:08:24,014 --> 00:08:25,814
- You're explaining.
- And, apparently,

231
00:08:25,815 --> 00:08:27,883
it comes out of my
paycheck, but that's okay.

232
00:08:27,884 --> 00:08:31,353
Only three more hours till
I break even for today.

233
00:08:31,354 --> 00:08:35,324
So don't feel the need to
over tip because we're friends.

234
00:08:35,325 --> 00:08:37,126
Okay.

235
00:08:37,127 --> 00:08:40,562
Or because I gave you free onion rings.

236
00:08:40,563 --> 00:08:43,231
No comps; that's coming
out of your paycheck.

237
00:08:44,633 --> 00:08:48,003
Learning through failure!

238
00:08:48,004 --> 00:08:51,507
My dad said poetry was for losers.

239
00:08:51,508 --> 00:08:53,542
He even threw my notebook in the trash.

240
00:08:53,543 --> 00:08:57,112
Interesting.

241
00:08:57,113 --> 00:08:59,682
But I wasn't allowed to cry,
so I just kept hitting baseballs

242
00:08:59,683 --> 00:09:01,583
harder and harder and sleeping my way

243
00:09:01,584 --> 00:09:03,384
through the female faculty.

244
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:08,691
Tragic. The young artist has
his dreams trampled. (gasps)

245
00:09:08,692 --> 00:09:10,459
This is the book.

246
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:13,228
A scathing indictment of
our sports-obsessed society.

247
00:09:13,229 --> 00:09:14,697
MURPHY: Hey,

248
00:09:14,698 --> 00:09:16,365
maybe I could put my poems in it.

249
00:09:16,366 --> 00:09:18,232
Brilliant idea.

250
00:09:23,238 --> 00:09:24,605
Meet me in the kitchen!

251
00:09:27,276 --> 00:09:29,178
What the hell is going on?

252
00:09:29,179 --> 00:09:31,380
We've had a breakthrough.
Turns out Murph has many layers.

253
00:09:31,381 --> 00:09:33,015
Oh, no, no, you dug.

254
00:09:33,016 --> 00:09:35,050
I didn't dig.

255
00:09:35,051 --> 00:09:36,952
You do like to dig.

256
00:09:36,953 --> 00:09:41,023
Hey, I-I came up with a
great name for the book.

257
00:09:41,024 --> 00:09:42,823
<i>Verses Loaded.</i>

258
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:45,194
Yeah, it's like bases loaded.

259
00:09:45,195 --> 00:09:47,062
Just give it a second.

260
00:09:47,063 --> 00:09:49,665
Murph, the reason the publishers
keep asking me to write

261
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:52,401
books like this is because I
know exactly what they want.

262
00:09:52,402 --> 00:09:54,269
They want a book about an athlete,

263
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:55,904
not about some poem guy.

264
00:09:55,905 --> 00:09:57,438
Or poet.

265
00:09:59,007 --> 00:10:00,776
So you think my poetry's stupid?

266
00:10:00,777 --> 00:10:03,144
It's your father all over again.

267
00:10:04,947 --> 00:10:06,215
You know what, Oscar?

268
00:10:06,216 --> 00:10:08,050
I'm really excited about this.

269
00:10:08,051 --> 00:10:10,352
It's my chance to show
the world who I really am,

270
00:10:10,353 --> 00:10:11,954
but if you don't want to do it, fine.

271
00:10:11,955 --> 00:10:13,522
I-I already have plenty of money.

272
00:10:13,523 --> 00:10:15,391
Well, I don't, so we
need to write the book

273
00:10:15,392 --> 00:10:17,292
or you need to give
me some of your money.

274
00:10:17,293 --> 00:10:20,496
Now, now, I'm sure that
we can find a compromise.

275
00:10:20,497 --> 00:10:22,398
Murph just wants to
honor the yearning soul

276
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,299
- beneath the jersey.
- Wait a second.

277
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:27,469
Felix, you got to write this with us.

278
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:29,870
Ooh, that's trouble.

279
00:10:31,373 --> 00:10:33,216
- What's happening?
- Oh, no, no, Murph,

280
00:10:33,217 --> 00:10:34,610
I couldn't; Oscar's the writer.

281
00:10:34,611 --> 00:10:36,412
- Thank you.
- But I could sit and look

282
00:10:36,413 --> 00:10:37,980
over his shoulder and edit as we go.

283
00:10:37,981 --> 00:10:40,783
Great! It's settled.

284
00:10:40,784 --> 00:10:42,951
What is happening?

285
00:10:42,952 --> 00:10:44,319
Oh, wow.

286
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,788
First two writers, now three.

287
00:10:45,789 --> 00:10:48,189
This book is gonna be twice as good.

288
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:54,395
Oh, that math teacher screwed
him in more ways than one.

289
00:10:56,598 --> 00:10:58,967
Oscar, I can tell by your
nostrils that you're angry.

290
00:10:58,968 --> 00:11:03,238
You need to check out
that vein in his neck.

291
00:11:03,239 --> 00:11:06,108
I only have 36 hours
to turn in this book.

292
00:11:06,109 --> 00:11:07,743
And I won't get in the way.

293
00:11:07,744 --> 00:11:10,412
I will just be a supportive,
unobtrusive presence.

294
00:11:10,413 --> 00:11:12,314
Oh, Dani, look at that. Very good.

295
00:11:12,315 --> 00:11:13,715
You know what?

296
00:11:13,716 --> 00:11:16,885
Now I'm thinking poppy seeds.

297
00:11:16,886 --> 00:11:18,987
They're elusive little
devils, so I will get you

298
00:11:18,988 --> 00:11:21,422
the small tweezers.

299
00:11:22,758 --> 00:11:26,195
You know, people fall off terraces.

300
00:11:26,196 --> 00:11:28,529
Happens every day.

301
00:11:35,673 --> 00:11:37,859
- All right, here we go.
- Before we begin,

302
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:41,460
I'd like to ask everyone to take a knee.

303
00:11:44,698 --> 00:11:47,488
Lord, as we begin this project,

304
00:11:47,489 --> 00:11:49,790
give us clear heads and fast fingers

305
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:51,891
to help us write goodly.

306
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:54,962
- Amen.
- Amen.

307
00:11:54,963 --> 00:11:56,664
God help me.

308
00:11:56,665 --> 00:11:58,632
Huh. Look at us.

309
00:11:58,633 --> 00:12:00,367
The dream team.

310
00:12:00,368 --> 00:12:02,770
Yes, very exciting.
Now let's get started.

311
00:12:02,771 --> 00:12:04,204
Chapter one.

312
00:12:04,205 --> 00:12:07,575
"My name is Marcus Murphy."

313
00:12:07,576 --> 00:12:09,043
That's true. That's right.

314
00:12:09,044 --> 00:12:10,878
I like it.

315
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:12,313
I like it, too.

316
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:14,413
I wish I loved it.

317
00:12:15,349 --> 00:12:17,551
What would make you love it?

318
00:12:17,552 --> 00:12:19,119
Oh, I don't know. Let's just try it out

319
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,588
for a minute, bat a few ideas around.

320
00:12:20,589 --> 00:12:22,556
"My name is Marcus Murphy."

321
00:12:22,557 --> 00:12:25,492
"Marcus Murphy is my name."

322
00:12:25,493 --> 00:12:28,194
"They call me Marcus Murphy."

323
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:31,198
"I'm Murphy. Marcus Murphy."

324
00:12:31,199 --> 00:12:32,800
You know what?

325
00:12:32,801 --> 00:12:35,201
Sometimes the muse just
teases. What we have is good.

326
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:38,439
"For as long as I can remember,

327
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,574
my family was into sports".

328
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:42,608
Same here.

329
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:46,447
You're being me. I got it.

330
00:12:46,448 --> 00:12:49,617
"When I first picked up a baseball,

331
00:12:49,618 --> 00:12:53,052
I knew I was home."

332
00:12:57,358 --> 00:13:00,159
Felix, I can feel your ear.

333
00:13:00,995 --> 00:13:03,731
I need to be able to see the pad.

334
00:13:03,732 --> 00:13:06,499
What have we got so far?

335
00:13:08,569 --> 00:13:11,304
(high-pitched whirring)

336
00:13:14,508 --> 00:13:17,009
(whirring)

337
00:13:17,878 --> 00:13:19,413
Oscar! Oscar!

338
00:13:19,414 --> 00:13:21,948
Oscar!

339
00:13:25,853 --> 00:13:28,022
Oscar, you could have killed someone.

340
00:13:28,023 --> 00:13:30,356
Yes, but I chose to do this instead.

341
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:33,827
"It was down to the final stretch.

342
00:13:33,828 --> 00:13:35,929
"Time to rally for one last push.

343
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:37,965
"And my mother pushed
with all her might,

344
00:13:37,966 --> 00:13:40,833
and I came into this world".

345
00:13:45,606 --> 00:13:49,243
Oh. Awesome! We did it!

346
00:13:49,244 --> 00:13:50,644
Yes, you were born.

347
00:13:50,645 --> 00:13:52,513
Now we just have to wait 20 years

348
00:13:52,514 --> 00:13:54,915
till the part people care about.

349
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:56,917
Ooh, I am beat.

350
00:13:56,918 --> 00:13:58,619
I'm gonna head home, take a nap,

351
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:00,320
maybe enjoy the company of a young lady.

352
00:14:00,321 --> 00:14:01,276
Which young lady?

353
00:14:01,277 --> 00:14:02,146
Oh, it's ten blocks.

354
00:14:02,147 --> 00:14:04,459
There'll be someone along the way.

355
00:14:04,534 --> 00:14:06,468
And then, I'm gonna bring
back some of my poems.

356
00:14:06,469 --> 00:14:08,856
Great. We can figure
out where to insert them.

357
00:14:08,857 --> 00:14:11,157
Are you open to suggestions?

358
00:14:11,158 --> 00:14:12,592
Well, it's a collaborative...

359
00:14:12,593 --> 00:14:13,993
Oh, I just got that.

360
00:14:13,994 --> 00:14:15,361
(clears his throat)

361
00:14:15,362 --> 00:14:16,896
All right, I'll see you guys tomorrow.

362
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:19,298
Felix, you keep this guy on track.

363
00:14:19,299 --> 00:14:21,134
Oh, you bet. I will crack the whip.

364
00:14:21,135 --> 00:14:22,602
- (imitates cracking whip)
- (laughing)

365
00:14:22,603 --> 00:14:24,270
(Oscar laughs)

366
00:14:24,271 --> 00:14:25,771
(laughing)

367
00:14:25,772 --> 00:14:28,941
Ha, ha, ha. I'm gonna kill you.

368
00:14:28,942 --> 00:14:31,577
Oscar, he wanted me.
I didn't ask for this.

369
00:14:31,578 --> 00:14:33,079
That's exactly what you did.

370
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,547
You dug, and you broke Murph,

371
00:14:34,548 --> 00:14:36,048
and you ruined what was supposed to be

372
00:14:36,049 --> 00:14:37,884
a perfectly nice book about baseball.

373
00:14:37,885 --> 00:14:40,520
Why are you so afraid to write
about anything with real depth?

374
00:14:40,521 --> 00:14:41,988
Why must you only skim the surface?

375
00:14:41,989 --> 00:14:44,390
Because I like the
surface. It's pleasant.

376
00:14:44,391 --> 00:14:47,293
It's pleasant, or is it safe?

377
00:14:47,294 --> 00:14:48,961
What's so scary down there?

378
00:14:48,962 --> 00:14:51,731
Oh, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no.

379
00:14:51,732 --> 00:14:53,799
Because it's keeping you from
fulfilling your potential.

380
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:57,336
No, no, no. You stay out of me!

381
00:14:57,337 --> 00:14:58,671
When we were in college,

382
00:14:58,672 --> 00:15:00,206
you wanted to be a
great sports journalist.

383
00:15:00,207 --> 00:15:01,641
You wanted to win a Pulitzer.

384
00:15:01,642 --> 00:15:03,509
I remember because I
was the one who told you

385
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:04,911
it's not pronounced Poo-litzer.

386
00:15:04,912 --> 00:15:07,313
I was a kid. I had lots of dreams.

387
00:15:07,314 --> 00:15:10,516
I wanted to touch a Lakers Girl's boob.

388
00:15:10,517 --> 00:15:13,152
It is never too late to
dust off those dreams.

389
00:15:13,153 --> 00:15:15,354
You know what you need?

390
00:15:15,355 --> 00:15:17,557
A visit to the emotional

391
00:15:17,558 --> 00:15:20,725
support tent.

392
00:15:25,131 --> 00:15:26,599
Oscar, what are you doing?

393
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,900
I'm locking you in.

394
00:15:27,901 --> 00:15:29,936
Oscar, let me out!

395
00:15:29,937 --> 00:15:32,804
You know that I'm bound
by the laws of mime!

396
00:15:35,474 --> 00:15:36,943
You got to finish this book, Oscar.

397
00:15:36,944 --> 00:15:38,277
Oh, what's the point?

398
00:15:38,278 --> 00:15:39,779
I'm a failure. I'm a hack.

399
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:42,181
Even so...

400
00:15:42,182 --> 00:15:44,250
But it's due tomorrow, and
you barely even started.

401
00:15:44,251 --> 00:15:47,253
Yeah, and I realized, that's
my way of protecting myself.

402
00:15:47,254 --> 00:15:50,189
I get to say I didn't have
time to write a great book,

403
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:51,924
rather than finding out I can't.

404
00:15:51,925 --> 00:15:54,126
Even so...

405
00:15:54,127 --> 00:15:56,128
(phone chimes)

406
00:15:56,129 --> 00:15:58,564
Ah, that's my snack alert.

407
00:15:58,565 --> 00:16:00,666
My one solid food a day.

408
00:16:00,667 --> 00:16:02,034
(laughs)

409
00:16:02,035 --> 00:16:03,669
Come here, baby.

410
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:05,671
(laughing)

411
00:16:05,672 --> 00:16:08,941
Mmm. It needs something.

412
00:16:08,942 --> 00:16:12,345
Like being wrapped in
bacon, sitting on a donut.

413
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:14,680
Mmm. Mmm.

414
00:16:14,681 --> 00:16:17,083
Emily, can I get a drink here?

415
00:16:17,084 --> 00:16:18,484
Oh, sure.

416
00:16:18,485 --> 00:16:20,386
I'm not a bartender, but what the heck.

417
00:16:20,387 --> 00:16:22,321
I'm learning all sorts
of new things today.

418
00:16:22,322 --> 00:16:24,290
Like day-old bread
makes great croutons,

419
00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:27,025
and rats don't die right
away in those traps.

420
00:16:30,296 --> 00:16:32,431
- Oscar.
- Go away.

421
00:16:32,432 --> 00:16:34,233
Stay out of my moneymaker's brain.

422
00:16:34,234 --> 00:16:36,435
Sorry, Teddy. It must be tough for you,

423
00:16:36,436 --> 00:16:37,970
knowing that your livelihood depends

424
00:16:37,971 --> 00:16:40,306
on another person's fragile creativity.

425
00:16:40,307 --> 00:16:42,808
I wouldn't be surprised
if under all that anger

426
00:16:42,809 --> 00:16:45,244
- was a little bit of fear.
- (Teddy laughs)

427
00:16:45,245 --> 00:16:46,979
Oh, good luck getting in here.

428
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:49,248
My wife has been trying for years,

429
00:16:49,249 --> 00:16:51,851
and she's not even in the lobby.

430
00:16:51,852 --> 00:16:55,362
I'm gonna call the publisher and
see if I can buy us some time.

431
00:16:56,555 --> 00:16:59,123
How'd you get out of the tent?

432
00:17:05,097 --> 00:17:08,100
I'm sorry, Oscar. This is all my fault.

433
00:17:08,101 --> 00:17:10,536
You know, I always thought
that I'd write a book

434
00:17:10,537 --> 00:17:12,405
that would make people
see sports differently,

435
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:14,573
<i>like Moneyball or Seabiscuit.</i>

436
00:17:14,574 --> 00:17:16,509
But instead, I'm cranking out a book

437
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:18,444
about a guy who has two talents...

438
00:17:18,445 --> 00:17:21,614
catching baseballs and
not catching chlamydia.

439
00:17:21,615 --> 00:17:24,016
I wasn't trying to upset you.

440
00:17:24,017 --> 00:17:25,618
I honestly thought I was being helpful.

441
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:27,787
It's funny, you live
in denial for so long,

442
00:17:27,788 --> 00:17:29,789
you can't see the sad
truth about yourself

443
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:31,357
until someone shoves it in your face.

444
00:17:31,358 --> 00:17:33,092
DANI: I did it, Felix.

445
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:35,761
At first I thought you were
crazy for being so picky,

446
00:17:35,762 --> 00:17:38,830
but now I see how all those
details make a difference.

447
00:17:39,899 --> 00:17:41,300
What?

448
00:17:41,301 --> 00:17:43,569
Oh, for God's sake, what is wrong now?

449
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:45,237
Are the seeds too close together?

450
00:17:45,238 --> 00:17:48,506
Is the lettuce too
emotionally available?

451
00:17:49,408 --> 00:17:51,744
No, it's a hamburger, all right.

452
00:17:51,745 --> 00:17:54,080
I'm going to take a picture of it,

453
00:17:54,081 --> 00:17:56,148
because that's what I do.

454
00:17:56,149 --> 00:17:59,218
I take pictures of hamburgers.

455
00:17:59,219 --> 00:18:01,020
You know, when I was in college,

456
00:18:01,021 --> 00:18:03,456
I dreamed of being Annie
Leibovitz or Richard Avedon,

457
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:05,725
photographing the essence of humanity.

458
00:18:05,726 --> 00:18:08,094
And now, I make fast food look good

459
00:18:08,095 --> 00:18:10,161
so Americans can get fatter.

460
00:18:10,996 --> 00:18:12,565
I am not an artist.

461
00:18:12,566 --> 00:18:15,066
I am a merchant of death!

462
00:18:16,068 --> 00:18:18,903
I'll leave my time sheet on your desk.

463
00:18:19,672 --> 00:18:22,441
Felix, can I get you anything?

464
00:18:22,442 --> 00:18:23,576
I'll have what he's having.

465
00:18:23,577 --> 00:18:25,511
An existential crisis.

466
00:18:25,512 --> 00:18:27,279
Is that one of those fancy drinks?

467
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,881
It's only my first day.

468
00:18:28,882 --> 00:18:32,585
No, Emily, it's when the
reality of your life crashes

469
00:18:32,586 --> 00:18:34,186
into the dreams of your youth.

470
00:18:34,187 --> 00:18:35,988
Hey, I have an idea.

471
00:18:35,989 --> 00:18:37,556
Why don't you both...

472
00:18:37,557 --> 00:18:41,093
(loudly): shut up?!

473
00:18:41,094 --> 00:18:41,994
I beg your pardon?

474
00:18:41,995 --> 00:18:43,529
"Waa, waa, waa.

475
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:45,965
I'm not as famous as
some famous person."

476
00:18:45,966 --> 00:18:49,200
"Waa, waa, Seabiscuit."

477
00:18:50,436 --> 00:18:52,538
Do you guys realize how lucky you are?

478
00:18:52,539 --> 00:18:54,940
You get paid to do what you love.

479
00:18:54,941 --> 00:18:56,609
Look at me.

480
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:58,144
Instead of designing jewelry,

481
00:18:58,145 --> 00:19:00,079
I've spent the day scrubbing toilets

482
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,847
and putting out a grease fire.

483
00:19:01,848 --> 00:19:05,584
Which I started, but
that is not the point!

484
00:19:05,585 --> 00:19:09,822
Wow. Emily, thank you
for your bracing honesty.

485
00:19:09,823 --> 00:19:12,091
We really lost perspective
there, right, Oscar?

486
00:19:12,092 --> 00:19:15,127
Well, that's not the way I
said "Seabiscuit," but, yeah.

487
00:19:15,128 --> 00:19:16,962
And, Emily, we believe in you.

488
00:19:16,963 --> 00:19:19,665
All of this... this is
just part of your journey.

489
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:22,668
Yeah, all this struggle is going
to make you a better artist.

490
00:19:22,669 --> 00:19:24,403
Huh.

491
00:19:24,404 --> 00:19:26,906
I never thought of it that way.

492
00:19:26,907 --> 00:19:28,574
Thank you.

493
00:19:28,575 --> 00:19:30,643
Well, onward and upward.

494
00:19:30,644 --> 00:19:32,578
- (laughs)
- Go get 'em.

495
00:19:32,579 --> 00:19:34,513
- God, her life is a train wreck.
- Ooh.

496
00:19:34,514 --> 00:19:36,314
(sighs)

497
00:19:37,116 --> 00:19:38,384
Hey, well, I had to beg,

498
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:40,052
but I bought us a couple of days.

499
00:19:40,053 --> 00:19:42,421
All right, I'm gonna go
upstairs and write that book.

500
00:19:42,422 --> 00:19:44,156
All right, so you're done playing

501
00:19:44,157 --> 00:19:46,692
Midlife Crisis: White People Edition?

502
00:19:46,693 --> 00:19:50,294
Wow. Look who turns into
Chris Rock when he's hungry.

503
00:19:51,564 --> 00:19:53,699
See, I can make race jokes, too.

504
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,768
- No, you can't.
- No, I can't.

505
00:19:55,769 --> 00:19:57,203
Yeah.

506
00:19:57,204 --> 00:19:58,504
While you are writing, Oscar,

507
00:19:58,505 --> 00:20:00,039
I will gratefully rededicate myself

508
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,607
- to the art of
food-tography. - TEDDY: Mmm.

509
00:20:01,608 --> 00:20:04,877
- Teddy, no!
- Screw this diet. I'm starving.

510
00:20:04,878 --> 00:20:07,213
That's not food. It's cardboard
and hairspray and paint.

511
00:20:07,214 --> 00:20:09,947
I don't care.

512
00:20:17,945 --> 00:20:20,035
Oh, there you are. I
just finished setting up.

513
00:20:20,036 --> 00:20:21,237
Hey!

514
00:20:21,238 --> 00:20:23,305
Don't feel obligated to buy anything.

515
00:20:23,306 --> 00:20:25,872
Felix thought Emily's business
could use a little boost,

516
00:20:25,873 --> 00:20:28,177
and he said it right in front
of me, so I had to agree.

517
00:20:28,178 --> 00:20:29,445
Hey!

518
00:20:29,446 --> 00:20:32,127
- Hi.
- I think I will take this tie clasp.

519
00:20:32,128 --> 00:20:34,395
My ties have had a mind
of their own lately.

520
00:20:34,396 --> 00:20:36,497
Yeah, I wasn't gonna say anything.

521
00:20:36,498 --> 00:20:38,466
Thank you, Felix. That'll be $45.

522
00:20:38,467 --> 00:20:40,101
So what about you, Oscar?

523
00:20:40,102 --> 00:20:42,119
- Does anything catch your eye?
- Yeah.

524
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:44,570
I think I'll take these cuff
links for my friend Murph.

525
00:20:44,571 --> 00:20:45,306
Oh.

526
00:20:45,307 --> 00:20:46,674
Oh. Those are $600.

527
00:20:46,675 --> 00:20:49,435
Guys don't buy guys jewelry.

528
00:20:51,012 --> 00:20:54,214
Oh, nothing like a good nap.

529
00:20:55,249 --> 00:20:57,651
How long was I sleep?

530
00:20:57,652 --> 00:21:00,454
About 30 hours.

531
00:21:00,455 --> 00:21:02,095
Have you been back there the whole time?

532
00:21:02,096 --> 00:21:03,462
Yeah, I curled up in the bathtub.

533
00:21:03,463 --> 00:21:05,146
I like to sleep someplace cocoon-like

534
00:21:05,147 --> 00:21:09,435
to simulate the support I never
got from my mother, or my wife.

535
00:21:09,436 --> 00:21:11,403
Want to dig into that one?

536
00:21:11,404 --> 00:21:13,572
No, I'm good.

537
00:21:13,573 --> 00:21:16,141
Hey, Marcus Murphy, I
got both your sex tapes!

538
00:21:16,142 --> 00:21:19,410
- Oh, all right. Okay.
- He was great.
