952
00:51:03,699 --> 00:51:05,599
Speech.
Sorry, monty.

953
00:51:05,699 --> 00:51:09,599
Anyway, boys,
seeing as your father here

954
00:51:09,699 --> 00:51:12,199
Is to public speaking as...

955
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:14,500
Stephen hawking is
to windsurfing,

956
00:51:14,599 --> 00:51:18,699
He has asked schmuggins here
to take on the bar mitzvah task

957
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:21,699
Of telling a classic
jewish funny story.

958
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:23,400
Sadly, though, I've become

959
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:27,400
A bit tired and emotional
this evening.

960
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:29,400
So, I --
and also very drunk.

961
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:32,300
So I've decided
to pass the baton,

962
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:35,900
To -- to -- to give the task
to my good friend

963
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,599
And classic
jewish storyteller.

964
00:51:38,699 --> 00:51:44,099
Ladies and gentlemen,
solly shimshileewitz.

965

[ applause ]

966
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:56,900
Uh...Hello.

967
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,800
Dear lord.

968
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:03,699
How about the story
about rabbi akiba

969
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:07,400
And fischel, the --
the village idiot?

970
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:10,500
Yeah. How about that?
That's a good idea.

971
00:52:10,599 --> 00:52:13,500
That's, uh...

972
00:52:13,599 --> 00:52:15,199
So...
[ clears throat ]

973
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:18,500
...There was a tale of,
uh, rabbi...

974
00:52:18,599 --> 00:52:19,699
Akiba.

975
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:24,699
...Akiba,
who lived in...Hotep.

976
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:29,599
And he always observed
his fedeyezyez flahot.

977
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:33,099
Uh...

978
00:52:33,199 --> 00:52:37,199
Then, in the syn--
no, no, I know this one.

979
00:52:37,300 --> 00:52:39,099
<i>The -- the --</i>
the shul.
Shul.

980
00:52:39,199 --> 00:52:40,500
That's it, the shul.

981
00:52:40,599 --> 00:52:42,300
<i>Shul.</i>
The shul.

982
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:45,800
In the shul came fischel,
the village idiot.

983
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:47,900
Well, what an idiot he was.

984
00:52:48,099 --> 00:52:51,300
And he went up to the rabbi,
and he said,

985
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:54,599
"rabbi, rabbi!

986
00:52:54,699 --> 00:52:58,099
My foreskin
has grown back."

987
00:53:00,699 --> 00:53:02,099
Um, he did.
He said that.

988
00:53:02,199 --> 00:53:03,400
No, he didn't.

989
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:07,300
He did, and the rabbi looked
at him and said, "you what?"

990
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:09,500
And fischel said,
"it's true.

991
00:53:09,699 --> 00:53:11,900
What do I do?"
about his foreskin.

992
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,500
And...
It was that point --

993
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:15,500
Can you help me
with this one, please?

994
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:17,599
Yes, yes.
Finish it off.

995
00:53:17,699 --> 00:53:19,400
Rabbi akiba says,

996
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:22,099
"moses said that when --
when --

997
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:24,300
"when the light
of the world is shining,

998
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:26,199
We must turn our faces
to the sky."

999
00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:27,400
That's it, yeah.

1000
00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:30,500
"and as joshua said when
the light of the world is dim,

We must turn our faces
to the ground."

1002
00:53:32,900 --> 00:53:33,800
To the ground.

"but I say --"
rabbi akiba says...

1004
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:38,000
Yeah, what did he say?

1005
00:53:38,099 --> 00:53:40,599
Well, rabbi akiba says...

1006
00:53:44,099 --> 00:53:48,400
Uh, rabbi akiba
looked at fischel.

1007
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:50,000
And he says...

What was that?

1012
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:27,500
Don't ask me.

Soon as I'm in a cab...
Sober as a church.

1019
00:55:17,099 --> 00:55:20,099
That was good tonight.
Didn't expect it.

1020
00:55:20,199 --> 00:55:22,000
Thanks, lenny.

1021
00:55:22,099 --> 00:55:23,500
Hey, mahmud.

1022
00:55:23,599 --> 00:55:27,300
This jew thing -- what --
what's so important?

1023
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:30,000
Izzy shimshileewitz.

1024
00:55:30,099 --> 00:55:31,400
What, he's still alive?

1025
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:33,199
Yeah, well, I think so.
I don't know.

1026
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:36,099
I-I can't be sure.
They won't let me see him.

1027
00:55:36,199 --> 00:55:37,400
What do you mean?
Who? They who?

1028
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:39,000
The rabbi.
The rabbi at the care home.

1029
00:55:39,099 --> 00:55:42,800
He said I've got to get
a bit more jewy.

1030
00:55:42,900 --> 00:55:44,099
Did he?

1031
00:55:44,199 --> 00:55:45,300
Yeah.

1032
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:47,300
When are you
gonna see him next?

1033
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:49,500
Soon as possible.
Tomorrow.

1034
00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:51,400
You know what? I'm gonna take
you. I'm gonna go with you.

1035
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:53,000
Yeah?

1036
00:55:53,099 --> 00:55:54,900
Yeah, I'm not gonna let

Get held back
by some asshole fruma.

1038
00:55:57,599 --> 00:55:58,699
I think --
you know, that's good.

1039
00:55:58,800 --> 00:55:59,800
That's really good
if you come.

1040
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:00,800
I'm gonna go.

1041
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:02,800
But you will be tactful,
though, will you?

1042
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:04,099
Yeah.

1043
00:56:04,199 --> 00:56:06,400
Because, you know,
this is a big thing for me.

1044
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:08,400
My dad -- you know,
my adopted one --

1045
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:11,900
When he died...
It really cut me up.

1046
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:15,699
You know, and now I've got
this other dad here,

1047
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:16,900
And it's just too much.

1048
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
Look, finding out you're jewish
doesn't mean

1049
00:56:19,099 --> 00:56:21,800
That suddenly every moment's
a therapeutic opportunity.

Hey.

Good night.

1055
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:47,800
Uh, dad...

1056
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:49,300
That was a bit weird today,

1057
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:51,000
Wasn't it,
with the rally?

1058
00:56:51,099 --> 00:56:53,500
Weird, yeah.
Yeah, it was.

1059
00:56:53,599 --> 00:56:56,199
I was just --
I was just trying, you know,

1060
00:56:56,300 --> 00:56:59,300
To show support for them,
the big stepfather guy.

1061
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:02,000
Yeah, but I think,
when he comes to see us,

1062
00:57:02,099 --> 00:57:04,900
You could, uh...
Turn it down a touch, maybe.

1063
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,599
Just a touch.

I spoke to sharif tonight.

1069
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:29,699
He isn't 60 until June.

1070
00:57:31,599 --> 00:57:34,000
Saamiya.

1071
00:57:34,099 --> 00:57:38,099
Do you remember
when we got married?

1072
00:57:38,199 --> 00:57:42,699
And you promised to love me
and honor me

1073
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:46,800
With faith and obedience
and gentleness?

1074
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:49,199
Yes, of course.

1075
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:50,699
Who is it?! Huh?!
Ow!

1076
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:52,199
That hurts!
Is it someone from work?!

1077
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:54,300
Work? What are you
talking about? They're all men.

1078
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:57,199
That pram-faced tart
from tesco's.

1079
00:57:57,300 --> 00:57:59,400
Blimey,
you noticed that?

1080
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:01,699
But I-I was
just looking.
Hmm.

1081
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:02,900
Anyway, you know,

1082
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,500
By the qur'an, I could have
four wives anyway.

1083
00:58:04,599 --> 00:58:06,099
Oh, that's why you've been
running to the mosque

1084
00:58:06,199 --> 00:58:07,500
All of this time,
is it, huh?!

1085
00:58:07,599 --> 00:58:08,699
Ow! Stop it!

1086
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:10,300
You know, I knew I should have
never married a shia.

1087
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:12,400
That hurts. Stop.
Will you stop?

1088
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:14,400
Will you calm down?
Calm down?

1089
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:17,500
I want to tell you
something.

1090
00:58:17,599 --> 00:58:19,300
Oh. No, it's not --

1091
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:20,400
What?

1092
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:22,099
You're not --

1093
00:58:22,199 --> 00:58:25,199
Mahmud, I spoke to the imam
because I was worried about you,

1094
00:58:25,300 --> 00:58:28,099
And he told me that you told him
this thing about yourself,

1095
00:58:28,199 --> 00:58:30,000
And I just laughed
because you can't be, can you?

1096
00:58:30,099 --> 00:58:32,199
Hey.
Oh, no.

1097
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:35,099
I've seen this
on the internet -- men like you.

1098
00:58:35,199 --> 00:58:37,800
They're called bears --
big, fat, hairy men.

1099
00:58:37,900 --> 00:58:39,500
No, no, no,
I'm not gay, all right?

1100
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:40,500
I'm not gay.

1101
00:58:40,599 --> 00:58:42,500
I've got the wrong end
of the stick.

1102
00:58:42,599 --> 00:58:45,800
Listen to me.
The truth is...

1103
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:49,900
The truth is...

1104
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,099
Mm?

1105
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,599
...I'm...

1106
00:58:55,599 --> 00:58:57,800
Frightened...

1107
00:58:57,900 --> 00:59:00,000
Frightened?

1108
00:59:00,099 --> 00:59:03,199
...Of meeting
arshad al-masri.

00:59:03,300 --> 00:59:06,000
At least,
I was frightened...

1110
00:59:06,099 --> 00:59:09,199
Till I started going to these
religious education classes.

1111
00:59:09,300 --> 00:59:11,199
Really?

1112
00:59:11,300 --> 00:59:13,500
Yeah, yeah, night classes
at the, uh, mosque.

1113
00:59:13,599 --> 00:59:15,500
Yeah.

1114
00:59:15,599 --> 00:59:17,900
[ chuckles ]

1115
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,599
[ mumbling ]

1116
00:59:20,699 --> 00:59:23,900
Mahmud,
that's so sweet!

1117
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,099
You're not ashamed
of me, then?

1118
00:59:26,199 --> 00:59:30,099
Ashamed?
I'm proud of you.

1119
00:59:30,199 --> 00:59:32,400
Wow.
Hey.

1120
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:38,599
Come here...And show me
how ungay you really are,

1121
00:59:38,699 --> 00:59:44,300
You big,
heterosexual bear!

1122
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:46,400
[ sighs ]

1123
00:59:54,099 --> 00:59:57,000
[ door opens ]

1124
00:59:57,099 --> 00:59:58,800
Ah. Hello.

1125
00:59:58,900 --> 01:00:00,199
How is he?

1126
01:00:00,300 --> 01:00:02,300
Stable, but no better.

1127
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:04,500
That's why I'm here 24/7
at the moment.

1128
01:00:04,599 --> 01:00:06,300
[ scoffs ]

1129
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:08,199
Sorry.
Just thought you said 24/7.

1130
01:00:08,300 --> 01:00:10,300
That's kind of weird
for a rabbi to say.

1131
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:12,900
Rabbi, so, this is my friend
leonard goldberg.

1132
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,099
He's been helping,
so, yeah.

1133
01:00:15,199 --> 01:00:18,199
I seem to remember us
setting a little test.

1134
01:00:18,300 --> 01:00:20,199
Yeah, he did. Lenny's been
helping me out with it.

1135
01:00:20,300 --> 01:00:22,300
Has he?
Yeah.

1136
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:24,199
Been doing my teacher thing,
you know,

1137
01:00:24,300 --> 01:00:29,699
For my yid-muslo, uh,
homey.

1138
01:00:29,900 --> 01:00:32,699
Say your shema.
I'm sorry.
Beg your pardon?

1139
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:34,400
The shema --
the lord's prayer.

1140
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:38,699
Oh, don't tell me
he hasn't taught --

1141
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:42,000
Uh, well,
name the five books of moses.

1142
01:00:42,099 --> 01:00:44,099
Yeah, I can do this.
[ clears throat ]

1143
01:00:44,199 --> 01:00:45,199
Genesis --

1144
01:00:45,300 --> 01:00:48,199
Uh, in hebrew.
In hebrew?

1145
01:00:49,699 --> 01:00:50,900
Gen-hesis.

1146
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,699
What's hebrew
for "phil collins"?

1147
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:54,900
Ex-hodus.
Okay.

1148
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:56,000
I've had
quite enough.

1149
01:00:56,099 --> 01:00:57,599
No, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

1150
01:00:57,699 --> 01:00:58,800
No, listen, listen, rabbi.

1151
01:00:58,900 --> 01:01:01,099
My friend has drunk
my chicken soup.

1152
01:01:01,199 --> 01:01:03,599
He's danced like a cossack
in my living room.

1153
01:01:03,699 --> 01:01:05,900
He told a funny story
at a bar mitzvah.

1154
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
And by the way,
he got a big laugh.

1155
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:12,000
I'm a jew, and my friend here
is jewish enough for me.

1156
01:01:12,099 --> 01:01:15,699
Come back when you've found
a better teacher.

1157
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:17,199
Where am I gonna find
one of those, huh -- craigslist?

1158
01:01:17,300 --> 01:01:21,099
Look, rabbi, I haven't even told
my wife and family about this.

1159
01:01:21,199 --> 01:01:22,599
Well, perhaps that's
where you should start.

1160
01:01:22,699 --> 01:01:23,599
Now, if you don't mind,

1161
01:01:23,699 --> 01:01:25,199
I've got a dying man's soul
to care for.

1162
01:01:25,300 --> 01:01:26,400
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1163
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:27,800
Listen, you sanctimonious
rabbinical cue ball.

1164
01:01:27,900 --> 01:01:29,599
[ indistinct shouting ]

1165
01:01:29,599 --> 01:01:30,900
Stop it!

1166
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,800
You're disturbing the residents.
You're frightening them.

1167
01:01:35,199 --> 01:01:38,800
Hi.

1168
01:01:47,699 --> 01:01:49,400
"hi"?

1169
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:51,400
Sorry.

1170
01:01:51,500 --> 01:01:54,800
 I'm a bow-legged chicken,
I'm a knock-kneed hen 

1171
01:01:54,900 --> 01:01:57,099
 never been so happy
since I don't know when 

1172
01:01:57,199 --> 01:01:58,199
You don't want to listen

1173
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:01,800
To what that oversized toddler
punk rabbi says.

1174
01:02:01,900 --> 01:02:04,199
I mean, I'm a little bit racist
towards muslims,

1175
01:02:04,300 --> 01:02:05,599
But this asshole?

1176
01:02:05,699 --> 01:02:08,000
If you have just an ounce
of allah left inside you,

1177
01:02:08,099 --> 01:02:10,199
He will never let you
anywhere near your dad.

1178
01:02:10,300 --> 01:02:12,300
I -- I should --
I should tell people.

1179
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:14,599
I -- I should tell everyone
I was born a jew.

1180
01:02:14,699 --> 01:02:17,199
That would be a very unjewish
thing to do.

1181
01:02:17,300 --> 01:02:20,500
You know, we don't like to call
attention to ourselves.

1182
01:02:20,599 --> 01:02:22,900
We're proud,
but we're proud quietly.

1183
01:02:24,500 --> 01:02:26,300
And --
and what about israelis?

1184
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:28,900
No, no, I told you --
they're not really jews.

1185
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
Yeah, yeah,
they're not exactly quiet

1186
01:02:31,099 --> 01:02:32,800
About themselves,
are they, what,

1187
01:02:32,900 --> 01:02:37,300
With all the warmongering and
the colonial rampaging and --

1188
01:02:37,300 --> 01:02:40,099
Oh, oh -- "if you --
if you throw a pebble at us,

1189
01:02:40,199 --> 01:02:43,699
We'll raze your hospitals
to the ground" foreign policy.

1190
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:46,400
Unlike the very quiet way in
which your palestinian cousins

1191
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:49,000
Strap bombs to themselves
and blow up school buses?

1192
01:02:49,099 --> 01:02:50,900
Yeah, yeah, you know --
you know full well

1193
01:02:51,099 --> 01:02:52,699
That there are
loads more palestinians

1194
01:02:52,900 --> 01:02:55,199
Killed by the israeli army
than the other way around.

1195
01:02:55,300 --> 01:02:58,300
[ brakes squealing ]

1196
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:01,699
What exactly is your problem,
fat boy?

1197
01:03:01,900 --> 01:03:06,400
Who are you to tell me
about jews?

1198
01:03:06,500 --> 01:03:08,699
No, don't look --
if you'd been a better teacher,

1199
01:03:08,900 --> 01:03:11,199
I would have been at my father's
deathbed right now!

1200
01:03:11,300 --> 01:03:12,599
What exactly
are you saying then, huh?

1201
01:03:12,699 --> 01:03:13,800
That it's my fault?

1202
01:03:13,900 --> 01:03:15,099
Yes!
Ah!

1203
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:17,800
You self-hating mentalist!

1204
01:03:17,900 --> 01:03:18,699
Get out of my cab.

1205
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:19,699
You what?

1206
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:22,599
You heard me!
Get out of my cab!

1207
01:03:22,699 --> 01:03:24,400
Americans
shouldn't bloody

1208
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:25,900
Be driving a black cab,
anyway!

1209
01:03:25,900 --> 01:03:26,900
Asshole.

1210
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:28,599
I'm gonna tell my family.
I am.

1211
01:03:28,699 --> 01:03:31,000
You know what?
I don't give a fuck what you do.

1212
01:03:31,099 --> 01:03:32,000
[ scoffs ]
anti-semite.

01:03:37,599 --> 01:03:39,199
Suck my fat one!

1215
01:03:39,300 --> 01:03:41,000
 get ready to start 

1216
01:03:41,099 --> 01:03:43,800
 flap your elbows
just for luck 

1217
01:03:43,900 --> 01:03:47,000
 then you wiggle and you waddle
like a baby duck 

1218
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:48,400
 come and dance with me,
honey 

1219

 tap your toes and glide 

1220
01:03:50,199 --> 01:03:53,400
 and we'll always be together
side by side 

1221
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:56,900
 we'll walk with a wiggle
and a giggle and a squawk

1223

Rashid, saamiya,
could you come down, please?

1224
01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:06,300
There's something
I've got to tell you.

1225
01:04:11,199 --> 01:04:17,300
Daddy, the funny men have come
to see if we're muslim enough.

1226

Mahmud. Oh, yes. Oh, yes.
Come and meet our guests.

1227
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:23,699
This is mr. Al-masri.

Please call me arshad.

Hey.
This is tariq.

Hey, hey.
It's very, uh --

1236

Whoa.

1237

Um, welcome.
Welcome, everyone.

1238

You are very welcome.
You are very welcome to my home.

1239

So, uh...What did you
have to tell us, mahmud?

What?

1241
01:04:55,699 --> 01:04:59,800
You came in saying that you have
something to tell us.

1242
01:04:59,900 --> 01:05:04,800
Yeah, I -- I was just gonna
tell everyone that I'm, uh --

1243
01:05:04,900 --> 01:05:08,599
I'm, uh...

on my way here,

1250
01:05:22,900 --> 01:05:25,900
And I thought nabi
would like it.
I do!

1251
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:29,699
Is it the theme song of the
worldwide islamic caliphate?

1252

Very good.
[ chuckles ]

1253
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:37,400
So, let us sit.

1577
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,199
I'm gonna stand up,
and I'm gonna take arshad on.

1578
01:26:46,300 --> 01:26:47,399
What?

1579
01:26:47,500 --> 01:26:48,899
Yeah.
I've done some reading.

1580
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,100
I've read the qur'an.
I've read the old testament.

1581
01:26:51,199 --> 01:26:53,100
I think --
are you mental?

1582
01:26:53,199 --> 01:26:54,800
He knows
this stuff backwards.

1583
01:26:54,899 --> 01:26:57,600
Do you really want to make
a complete twat of yourself

1584
01:26:57,699 --> 01:27:00,699
In front
of the whole community again?

1585
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:01,899
Yeah, but, son,

1586
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,699
It's -- it's not exactly
the whole community, is it?

1587
01:27:04,899 --> 01:27:06,000
Oh, oh, it is.

1588
01:27:06,100 --> 01:27:07,899
Since your little moment
on tv,

1589
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:09,899
It's not just
the wahhabi nutters

1590
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:11,199
Who want to see arshad.

1591
01:27:11,300 --> 01:27:13,300
No, no, no!
Everyone's interested!

1592
01:27:13,399 --> 01:27:14,600
Oh.

1593
01:27:14,699 --> 01:27:19,800
Dad, please.
Open your eyes.

1594
01:27:19,899 --> 01:27:22,399
Son, son.

1595
01:27:22,500 --> 01:27:24,600
[ sighs ]

1596
01:27:34,500 --> 01:27:37,600
My eyes.

1597
01:28:02,800 --> 01:28:05,699
They're starting about now --
the lecture.

1598
01:28:05,800 --> 01:28:07,699
Mum, forget it.

1599
01:28:07,800 --> 01:28:09,699
You know, muna's gone.

1600
01:28:09,800 --> 01:28:11,000
Well, that's --
that's up to her.

1601
01:28:11,100 --> 01:28:13,399
But, rashid --
mum, we're not going.

1602
01:28:13,500 --> 01:28:16,399
Remember what he's done.

1603
01:28:16,500 --> 01:28:19,800
Look not at what a man has done,
but what he hopes to do.

1604
01:28:19,899 --> 01:28:22,699
Who taught you that,
nabi?

1605
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:24,500
Daddy.

1606
01:28:28,600 --> 01:28:31,800
Arshad: If that means
refusing, speaking out against,

1607
01:28:31,899 --> 01:28:34,800
Even tearing down
those aspects of western culture

1608
01:28:34,899 --> 01:28:38,899
Which disgust and dismay
the true believer,

1609
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:41,100
So be it.

1610
01:28:41,199 --> 01:28:43,300
[ applause ]

1611
01:28:50,699 --> 01:28:53,500
Thank you.

1612
01:28:53,600 --> 01:28:56,800
Thank you very much, my brothers
and sisters, of course.

1613
01:28:56,899 --> 01:28:59,199
Now, any questions?

1614
01:28:59,300 --> 01:29:01,600
Yes?

1615
01:29:01,699 --> 01:29:03,500
Brother arshad,

1616
01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:07,500
How can we support
your cause?

1617
01:29:07,600 --> 01:29:10,899
Well, by listening and acting
on my words.

1618
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:14,600
But also, if you wish, there are
donations that can be made.

1619
01:29:14,699 --> 01:29:16,800
Details are available
at the door.

1620
01:29:16,899 --> 01:29:19,199
Yes, brother?

1621
01:29:19,300 --> 01:29:21,699
Tell us also, brother,

1622
01:29:21,800 --> 01:29:25,899
How come you are
so remarkably good...

1623
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,100
Mum, I'm gonna go and --
wait, wait.

1624
01:29:28,199 --> 01:29:29,199
Have you seen uzma?

1625
01:29:29,300 --> 01:29:31,199
Rashid,
look over there.
Where?

1626
01:29:31,300 --> 01:29:33,100
That is very kind of you
to say, brother.

1627
01:29:33,199 --> 01:29:35,399
Well, I have the advantage,
of course, of coming

1628
01:29:35,500 --> 01:29:39,300
From a long and eminent line
of great islamic preachers.

1629
01:29:39,399 --> 01:29:43,699
But who knows
if I do them justice?

1630
01:29:43,800 --> 01:29:47,399
[ applause ]

1631
01:29:47,500 --> 01:29:49,600
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.

1632
01:29:49,800 --> 01:29:52,000
So, if there are
no further questions...

1633
01:29:52,100 --> 01:29:54,899
Yes, holy sister?

1634
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,699
[ high-pitched voice ]
question for brother arshad.

1635
01:29:57,800 --> 01:30:00,899
Is it possible that you,
being such a fantastic speaker,

1636
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:01,899
There's something
you've forgotten...

1637
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:05,699
Which is...
[ crowd murmuring ]

1638
01:30:18,699 --> 01:30:21,399
You're stretched it really badly
now, you big knobhead.

1639
01:30:21,500 --> 01:30:23,600
[ normal voice ]
let me ask you this.

1640
01:30:23,699 --> 01:30:26,399
Why won't you let my son
marry your stepdaughter?

1641
01:30:26,600 --> 01:30:29,399
Well, well,
if it isn't "mahmud nasir."

1642
01:30:29,500 --> 01:30:30,500
[ laughter ]

1643
01:30:30,600 --> 01:30:31,699
Answer the question.

1644
01:30:31,800 --> 01:30:32,800
Mum, what is he doing?

1645
01:30:32,899 --> 01:30:36,699
The holy qur'an
al-baqarah ayah 221 --

1646
01:30:36,800 --> 01:30:40,199
Do not marry your girls
to unbelievers.

1647
01:30:40,300 --> 01:30:42,899
[ applause ]

1648
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:44,600
Until they believe.

1649
01:30:44,699 --> 01:30:45,800
I beg your pardon?

1650
01:30:45,899 --> 01:30:48,000
Well, that's how
the ayah continues.

1651
01:30:48,199 --> 01:30:51,899
An islamic woman can marry
any man who believes in allah.

1652
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,800
And my son
believes in allah.

1653
01:30:54,899 --> 01:30:55,899
And how can I
believe in the son

1654
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:59,199
When I cannot believe
in the father, hmm?

1655
01:30:59,300 --> 01:31:01,699
Oh. Welcome.

1656
01:31:01,800 --> 01:31:04,899
No, no, no, no. Don't --
don't get up on the stage.

1657
01:31:04,899 --> 01:31:06,399
[ laughter ]

1658
01:31:06,500 --> 01:31:10,600
A bit harder.
[ laughs ]

1659
01:31:16,500 --> 01:31:20,000
And what are you today,
brother?

1660
01:31:20,100 --> 01:31:23,100
What is the...
[ speaks indistinctly ]

1661
01:31:23,199 --> 01:31:25,100
[ laughter ]

1662
01:31:25,199 --> 01:31:26,699
I am a muslim.

1663
01:31:26,800 --> 01:31:30,199
[ speaking arabic ]

1664
01:31:30,300 --> 01:31:34,100
Well, well, well, well.
Saying our holy words.

1665
01:31:34,199 --> 01:31:37,000
At-taghabun ayah 73 --

1666
01:31:37,100 --> 01:31:40,699
Strive hard
against the unbeliever.

1667
01:31:40,800 --> 01:31:44,600
I believe my shahada,

1668
01:31:44,600 --> 01:31:46,800
Because it's
my lord's prayer.

1669
01:31:46,899 --> 01:31:49,800
And you know what else
I learned recently?

1670
01:31:49,899 --> 01:31:52,199
The jews have
their own lord's prayer.

1671
01:31:52,399 --> 01:31:54,699
You know what it's called?
The shema.

1672
01:31:54,800 --> 01:31:56,000
What is he talking about?

1673
01:31:56,100 --> 01:31:58,800
Do you know what moses called
god in the original hebrew?

1674
01:31:58,899 --> 01:32:03,000
Elah --
allah, elah --

1675
01:32:03,100 --> 01:32:05,000
Because it's the same god.

1676
01:32:05,100 --> 01:32:06,899
Very, very good,
mahmud.

1677
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:10,100
You've learned some
of the qur'an by heart.

1678
01:32:10,199 --> 01:32:12,100
[ chuckles ]
mazel tov.

1679
01:32:12,199 --> 01:32:14,899
So, maybe you tell us,
mahmud,

1680
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,600
Before all this
delicate business

1681
01:32:17,699 --> 01:32:20,199
About your parentage
happened,

1682
01:32:20,300 --> 01:32:23,699
How often did you go
to the mosque?

1683
01:32:23,800 --> 01:32:26,500
Five times a day
I'll assume, surely.

1684
01:32:26,600 --> 01:32:29,399
Well...
No?

1685
01:32:29,500 --> 01:32:30,500
[ laughter ]

1686
01:32:30,600 --> 01:32:32,500
Oh, dear.

1687
01:32:32,600 --> 01:32:35,199
Devotion at home, then?

1688
01:32:35,300 --> 01:32:37,800
I'll bet if you got
your prayer mat out now,

1689
01:32:37,899 --> 01:32:41,199
It would have two big holes
in it from so much kneeling.

1690
01:32:41,300 --> 01:32:42,500
Yeah.
[ laughter ]

1691
01:32:42,600 --> 01:32:45,399
Not that, either?
Tsk, tsk.

1692
01:32:45,500 --> 01:32:47,899
At least, I assume

1693
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,500
You kept yourself free
of all pollution.

1694
01:32:50,600 --> 01:32:53,199
You're able to admit,
aren't you,

1695
01:32:53,300 --> 01:32:58,399
With your hand
on the holy qur'an,

1696
01:32:58,600 --> 01:33:02,399
That alcohol
has never passed your lips.

1697
01:33:08,600 --> 01:33:11,300
Hmm.

1698
01:33:11,399 --> 01:33:13,600
Okay, okay, my son.

1699
01:33:13,699 --> 01:33:16,300
I think you
better step down now.

1700
01:33:16,399 --> 01:33:18,899
Yeah.
Yeah.

1701
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:27,500
You can also add
to that list.

1702
01:33:27,600 --> 01:33:31,899
I've lied...

1703
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,100
To the people
I love the most.

1704
01:33:34,199 --> 01:33:36,399
I've been a poor father.

1705
01:33:36,500 --> 01:33:41,699
Been trying so hard to find
myself that I forgot myself.

1706
01:33:41,800 --> 01:33:46,000
I forgot who I am,

1707
01:33:46,100 --> 01:33:48,600
Which is
a husband and a father.

1708
01:33:50,199 --> 01:33:56,000
And, yes, I have not been
the muslim I should have been.

1709
01:33:56,100 --> 01:33:59,100
But who here has?

1710
01:33:59,199 --> 01:34:04,100
Who here has,
except for arshad al-masri?

1711
01:34:04,199 --> 01:34:09,699
And what is your name,
solly?

1712
01:34:12,399 --> 01:34:17,500
My name is mahmud nasir.

1713
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:19,800
And for once, yes,
for a very short period,

1714
01:34:19,899 --> 01:34:22,100
It was
solly shimshileewitz.

1715
01:34:22,199 --> 01:34:25,000
And of that,
I am no longer ashamed.

[ crowd murmuring ]

1717
01:34:27,300 --> 01:34:30,000
A good man,
a good muslim,

1718
01:34:30,100 --> 01:34:33,600
Should not just never lie
about who he is,

1719
01:34:33,699 --> 01:34:37,899
He should also
never lie about who he was.

1720
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,699
Oh, and,
by the way, arshad,

1721
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:43,899
"strive hard
against the unbelievers" --

1722
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:47,000
It's al-tawbah ayah 73.

1723
01:34:50,600 --> 01:34:53,100
Here's the thing
about our clerics.

1724
01:34:53,199 --> 01:34:55,600
Some of them really do teach us
about the holy qur'an.

1725
01:34:55,699 --> 01:34:57,199
And that's fantastic.

1726
01:34:57,300 --> 01:34:58,600
Some of them are out there,

1727
01:34:58,699 --> 01:35:01,800
Protecting our oppressed
brothers and sisters.

1728
01:35:01,899 --> 01:35:04,300
And some of them...
[ scoffs ]

1729
01:35:04,399 --> 01:35:09,600
...Are beardy, weirdy fuckers
who make shit up!

1730
01:35:09,699 --> 01:35:13,000
[ cheers and applause ]

1731
01:35:16,600 --> 01:35:20,000
Now, listen, you.

1732
01:35:20,100 --> 01:35:24,199
I don't care about all
