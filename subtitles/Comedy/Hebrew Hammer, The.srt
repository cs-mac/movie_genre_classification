1
00:04:46,226 --> 00:04:48,260
<i>Steinar...</i>

2
00:04:48,262 --> 00:04:50,428
You were right.

3
00:04:51,631 --> 00:04:54,065
Some of them do have brains.

4
00:04:54,067 --> 00:04:56,601
More than can be said for you,
you fucking animal.

5
00:05:01,474 --> 00:05:03,675
Good that we wet our blades so quickly.

6
00:05:03,677 --> 00:05:05,677
They were just farmers.

7
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:09,981
Well, now they're farming in Hell.

8
00:05:12,585 --> 00:05:15,353
The rest of our boats will be in by nightfall.

9
00:05:16,689 --> 00:05:18,690
Bring up the horses.

10
00:05:18,692 --> 00:05:20,692
Halfdan can follow once they've landed.

11
00:05:23,095 --> 00:05:25,163
My father's not a patient man.

12
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,502
Grim, Jokul.

13
00:06:01,133 --> 00:06:03,468
If he's a Saxon, he's gonna
have a fuck of a surprise

14
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:05,570
- <i>when he rides into us.</i>
- <i>That's no Saxon.</i>

15
00:06:11,744 --> 00:06:13,979
So this is our welcome.

16
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:20,552
Vali, what's happened?

17
00:06:22,221 --> 00:06:24,622
The omens promised victory if we attacked early.

18
00:06:24,624 --> 00:06:26,691
The Gods were against us.

19
00:06:26,693 --> 00:06:28,727
Your father's badly wounded, Steinar.

20
00:06:34,033 --> 00:06:35,633
Take me to him.

21
00:07:49,175 --> 00:07:50,575
Steinar.

22
00:07:52,511 --> 00:07:54,746
Better late than never.

23
00:07:54,748 --> 00:07:56,781
I came when I said I would.

24
00:07:58,217 --> 00:08:00,118
And this is the army you brought with you?

25
00:08:03,756 --> 00:08:06,391
He was fed Gruel at first light.

26
00:08:06,393 --> 00:08:09,394
The onions can already be smelled
through his stomach.

27
00:08:09,396 --> 00:08:12,263
If his guts are pierced,
there's nothing more we can do.

28
00:08:12,265 --> 00:08:13,798
How long?

29
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,568
A week, maybe less.

30
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:20,672
Listen, Steinar,

31
00:08:20,674 --> 00:08:23,875
I know we haven't always seen eye to eye,

32
00:08:23,877 --> 00:08:25,877
but we're still brothers after all

33
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:27,879
and I want you to know that when I'm King

34
00:08:27,881 --> 00:08:30,748
I'll make sure you're taken care of.

35
00:08:58,310 --> 00:08:59,777
The omens

36
00:08:59,779 --> 00:09:02,147
deceived us, Steinar.

37
00:09:03,916 --> 00:09:06,851
An army of 500 are only hours behind me.

38
00:09:07,853 --> 00:09:10,622
All this talk of reason...

39
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:14,893
sounds like a cover-up
for weakness.

40
00:09:14,895 --> 00:09:17,929
<i>We lie here because
we have no choice.</i>

41
00:09:17,931 --> 00:09:19,931
We need land!

42
00:09:19,933 --> 00:09:21,900
We either take it

43
00:09:21,902 --> 00:09:23,835
<i>or our people perish.</i>

44
00:09:23,837 --> 00:09:25,737
We may have lost the battle, father,

45
00:09:25,739 --> 00:09:27,372
but we can still win the war.

46
00:09:27,374 --> 00:09:30,375
And who'll lead them?

47
00:09:30,377 --> 00:09:32,777
You?

48
00:09:32,779 --> 00:09:36,948
In all your fucking finery?

49
00:09:42,922 --> 00:09:46,424
I will lead our army, father.

50
00:09:46,426 --> 00:09:48,760
You're no more fit than he is.

51
00:09:48,762 --> 00:09:53,264
Once, maybe.

52
00:09:53,266 --> 00:09:55,833
But after your mother left...

53
00:09:57,903 --> 00:09:59,938
you changed,

54
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:02,340
turned your back on the Gods.

55
00:10:02,342 --> 00:10:04,542
Thought you knew better, huh?

56
00:10:04,544 --> 00:10:06,811
I am strong enough to be King.

57
00:10:13,752 --> 00:10:15,987
Then prove it.

58
00:10:15,989 --> 00:10:17,822
Your half brother--

59
00:10:17,824 --> 00:10:20,792
my bastard son--

60
00:10:20,794 --> 00:10:23,628
<i>refused to enter
the field of battle.</i>

61
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:26,798
I made him swear an oath
to wait till I returned.

62
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,268
You know the punishment for those
that turn their back in combat.

63
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:31,803
See it's done.

64
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:56,661
I will do it, father.

65
00:10:56,663 --> 00:10:59,664
Leave him, Harald.
Leave him!

66
00:10:59,666 --> 00:11:02,734
Get out, now!

67
00:11:12,745 --> 00:11:14,946
Not you, Steinar.

68
00:11:21,754 --> 00:11:25,757
There's a man worthy of this crown,

69
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:28,626
a man with fire in his heart,

70
00:11:28,628 --> 00:11:32,764
brave enough to wield
the Hammer of the Gods--

71
00:11:35,834 --> 00:11:38,670
my firstborn.

72
00:11:38,672 --> 00:11:41,306
You said you'd kill anyone
who mentioned his name.

73
00:11:42,808 --> 00:11:44,575
The time has passed.

74
00:11:46,378 --> 00:11:47,979
Nobody knows where he is.

75
00:11:47,981 --> 00:11:49,814
He hasn't been seen for years.

76
00:11:51,483 --> 00:11:53,384
Find your brother.

77
00:11:53,386 --> 00:11:55,687
Find Hakan.

78
00:11:55,689 --> 00:11:59,090
Return with a King who will lead us to victory.

79
00:11:59,092 --> 00:12:00,591
I am needed here.

80
00:12:00,593 --> 00:12:02,760
I may be dying,

81
00:12:02,762 --> 00:12:04,462
but I'm still your King.

82
00:12:04,464 --> 00:12:06,464
Defy me again,

83
00:12:06,466 --> 00:12:10,034
and I will cut your heart out myself.

84
00:12:10,036 --> 00:12:12,837
Now swear

85
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:16,441
on the memory of your mother.

86
00:12:22,548 --> 00:12:24,549
I swear.

87
00:12:29,788 --> 00:12:32,056
You're out of your fucking mind.

88
00:12:32,058 --> 00:12:34,926
- I swore an oath.
- Oaths are horseshit, Steinar.

89
00:12:34,928 --> 00:12:37,929
I gave him my word.
I will not break it.

90
00:12:37,931 --> 00:12:40,765
Hakan is almost certain to be dead by now.

91
00:12:40,767 --> 00:12:43,501
And if he's not, he was fucking insane
before he was banished

92
00:12:43,503 --> 00:12:45,370
he'll only be more so now.

93
00:12:46,805 --> 00:12:49,774
Anyway, who knows where the fuck he is?

94
00:12:52,911 --> 00:12:54,879
- You do.
- It's too dangerous.

95
00:12:54,881 --> 00:12:57,548
Dangerous, is it?

96
00:12:57,550 --> 00:13:00,451
Then you must know where he is.

97
00:13:02,621 --> 00:13:05,757
Listen,
say I do know--

98
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:08,159
which I don't,
but say I did--

99
00:13:08,161 --> 00:13:10,661
what makes you think he'd come back?

100
00:13:10,663 --> 00:13:12,730
It's the King's wish.

101
00:13:12,732 --> 00:13:15,733
The King will be dead in a week.

102
00:13:18,404 --> 00:13:22,106
Bide your time.
Be close at hand when he dies.

103
00:13:22,108 --> 00:13:24,675
And when the moment's right,
you take the crown for yourself.

104
00:13:26,712 --> 00:13:28,413
We'd all back you against Harald.

105
00:13:35,721 --> 00:13:37,422
Think about it.

106
00:14:15,627 --> 00:14:18,696
When I said I didn't know where Hakan was,
I spoke the truth.

107
00:14:21,133 --> 00:14:24,569
But I do know how to find the last
man who saw him.

108
00:14:24,571 --> 00:14:27,638
Whether he's capable of helping us
remains to be seen.

109
00:14:55,667 --> 00:14:58,135
- Going somewhere?
- It doesn't concern you, grim.

110
00:14:58,137 --> 00:15:00,204
Let us pass.

111
00:15:00,206 --> 00:15:02,673
- <i>Like fuck.</i>
- <i>You'd think differently</i>

112
00:15:02,675 --> 00:15:04,575
if you knew where we were going.

113
00:15:04,577 --> 00:15:06,577
We're heading for the black mountains

114
00:15:06,579 --> 00:15:08,513
in search of Ivar The Boneless.

115
00:15:08,515 --> 00:15:10,948
That fat fuck?

116
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:13,551
Last night I heard he chopped his own head off.

117
00:15:13,553 --> 00:15:16,020
Well, I heard he transformed himself
into a bear.

118
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:21,959
What do you want with that
cocksucking maniac anyway?

119
00:15:21,961 --> 00:15:24,762
He's the only one who can lead us to Hakan.

120
00:15:27,099 --> 00:15:29,800
It's a two-day ride
through Saxon country,

121
00:15:29,802 --> 00:15:31,302
and who knows after that?

122
00:15:33,305 --> 00:15:36,641
You think we're cowards, is that it?

123
00:15:36,643 --> 00:15:38,709
It sounds like it to me.

124
00:15:38,711 --> 00:15:42,046
'Cause if it is, you can kiss my fucking axe.

125
00:15:42,048 --> 00:15:43,981
<i>I looked at the bones,
Steinar.</i>

126
00:15:43,983 --> 00:15:46,584
It's already been decided--
we'll travel together.

127
00:15:46,586 --> 00:15:48,753
- The bones said that?
- Aye.

128
00:15:48,755 --> 00:15:51,255
How far do you think you'll get?

129
00:15:51,257 --> 00:15:55,226
Take us with you--
you double your odds.

130
00:16:00,633 --> 00:16:02,333
Not you, Vali.

131
00:16:03,769 --> 00:16:05,603
Well, why not?

132
00:16:05,605 --> 00:16:07,772
'Cause your sword's as limp as your cock, boy.

133
00:16:13,345 --> 00:16:16,747
Steinar, take me with you.

134
00:16:16,749 --> 00:16:19,250
Watch Harald, hmm?

135
00:16:19,252 --> 00:16:21,252
Report to me when I get back.

136
00:16:56,755 --> 00:16:58,756
The sun is sinking.

137
00:17:00,225 --> 00:17:02,226
Let's find a place to rest.

138
00:17:02,228 --> 00:17:04,228
Yeah.

139
00:17:20,212 --> 00:17:22,813
There was a time
when they did everything together--

140
00:17:22,815 --> 00:17:25,249
Hakan and Ivar.

141
00:17:25,251 --> 00:17:27,385
My father went raiding with them--

142
00:17:27,387 --> 00:17:29,420
fucking carnage.

143
00:17:29,422 --> 00:17:32,089
After Hakan was banished,

144
00:17:32,091 --> 00:17:35,192
people were less willing to tolerate
Ivar's behavior.

145
00:17:36,963 --> 00:17:38,663
<i>He knew where Hakan had gone,</i>

146
00:17:38,665 --> 00:17:40,965
so he set off after him.

147
00:17:40,967 --> 00:17:42,967
Why do they call him boneless?

148
00:17:42,969 --> 00:17:46,170
Because you could never see his cock,

149
00:17:46,172 --> 00:17:48,706
'cause it was always rammed to the hilt

150
00:17:48,708 --> 00:17:50,174
up some young boy's asshole.

151
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:54,211
<i>They say he felt
no pain.</i>

152
00:17:54,213 --> 00:17:57,048
Which is more than can be said for
the young boy's asshole.

153
00:17:59,118 --> 00:18:01,452
I fought beside him a couple of times.

154
00:18:03,989 --> 00:18:06,857
Whatever people think of Ivar now,

155
00:18:06,859 --> 00:18:09,193
he was something to behold in battle.

156
00:18:10,696 --> 00:18:12,396
They both were.

157
00:18:12,398 --> 00:18:14,965
Why did my father banish Hakan?

158
00:18:14,967 --> 00:18:17,868
He was cursed.

159
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:19,770
Your father had his reasons.

160
00:18:21,239 --> 00:18:23,107
Maybe it doesn't matter what he did.

161
00:18:23,109 --> 00:18:25,176
It does if he's gonna be King.

162
00:19:19,231 --> 00:19:21,232
Steinar, it's me!

163
00:19:21,234 --> 00:19:24,368
Argh!

164
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:27,138
You'll get yourself killed.

165
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:29,940
I did as you said.

166
00:19:29,942 --> 00:19:31,942
I followed Harald.

167
00:19:31,944 --> 00:19:34,145
He rode out almost the minute you left.

168
00:19:34,147 --> 00:19:37,114
He crossed the Saxon lines
and spoke to their King.

169
00:19:37,116 --> 00:19:38,549
Fucking snake!

170
00:19:38,551 --> 00:19:41,051
I didn't know what to do.

171
00:19:43,088 --> 00:19:45,189
You did the right thing, Vali.

172
00:19:45,191 --> 00:19:47,258
You should head back now,
before they notice you're gone.

173
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:49,260
No, it's too dangerous.

174
00:19:51,096 --> 00:19:53,097
Vali can ride with us.

175
00:19:53,099 --> 00:19:54,899
Grim, get him some food.

176
00:19:54,901 --> 00:19:56,967
He can get his own food.
We turn back,

177
00:19:56,969 --> 00:19:59,403
cut Harald's balls off and rip out his spine.

178
00:19:59,405 --> 00:20:01,872
No. We continue
our ride north.

179
00:20:01,874 --> 00:20:06,010
Steinar, Harald's cut a deal with the Saxons.

180
00:20:06,012 --> 00:20:08,145
Our men would never back Harald.

181
00:20:08,147 --> 00:20:10,981
It's one thing to want
the crown, another to take it.

182
00:20:10,983 --> 00:20:13,818
You'd rather we have us climbing mountains

183
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:16,887
on some fucking bear hunt
while your cunt fuck of a brother

184
00:20:16,889 --> 00:20:18,589
sells our women to a bunch of farmers!

185
00:20:18,591 --> 00:20:21,859
Our women are more than a match for Harald.

186
00:20:21,861 --> 00:20:24,595
Grim,

187
00:20:24,597 --> 00:20:27,598
nobody forced you to come.

188
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,301
Nobody's forcing you to stay.

189
00:21:01,633 --> 00:21:04,535
Oh, I know you struggle with your beliefs,

190
00:21:04,537 --> 00:21:07,504
that you deny the Gods
and the significance of signs...

191
00:21:09,241 --> 00:21:11,408
But a lone rider arriving under a full Moon?

192
00:21:13,245 --> 00:21:16,247
Even you can't deny what a bad omen
that is for all of us.

193
00:21:16,249 --> 00:21:18,382
He's young.
He's got good instincts.

194
00:21:18,384 --> 00:21:20,384
He brings death with him.

195
00:21:23,421 --> 00:21:25,522
I'm not about to turn against him

196
00:21:25,524 --> 00:21:27,992
for the sake of your superstitions.

197
00:21:27,994 --> 00:21:30,494
If a man doesn't believe in omens,

198
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:33,297
then how can he know what he believes in?

199
00:21:37,269 --> 00:21:39,904
He can believe in himself.

200
00:22:11,536 --> 00:22:14,405
<i>No!</i>

201
00:22:21,413 --> 00:22:22,947
We should ride on.

202
00:22:24,482 --> 00:22:26,951
You bitch!

203
00:22:30,556 --> 00:22:32,656
You're right.

204
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:40,564
Stop!

205
00:22:59,718 --> 00:23:01,051
Stop.

206
00:23:12,764 --> 00:23:14,732
- Let her go.
- Fuck you, heathen.

207
00:23:18,269 --> 00:23:19,536
Argh!

208
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:14,291
- You all right?
- Crazy fucking bitch.

209
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:20,330
Let's go.

210
00:24:43,621 --> 00:24:45,622
The horses won't make it much further.

211
00:24:47,325 --> 00:24:48,692
Then we continue on foot.

212
00:24:54,432 --> 00:24:57,301
Vali, you wait with the horses till we return.

213
00:24:57,303 --> 00:24:59,369
Don't light a fire.

214
00:24:59,371 --> 00:25:01,438
Fires attract cave trolls.

215
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,574
Don't worry.

216
00:25:03,576 --> 00:25:06,343
They only eat virgins.

217
00:25:06,345 --> 00:25:09,146
They'll eat anything if they're hungry enough.

218
00:25:10,548 --> 00:25:13,884
Speaking of cave trolls, how is your sister?

219
00:25:13,886 --> 00:25:15,752
Fuck you, grim.

220
00:25:15,754 --> 00:25:18,188
She certainly did.

221
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:19,823
Still hurts when I piss.

222
00:25:22,894 --> 00:25:24,828
We'll be back by first light.

223
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:26,296
Steinar.

224
00:25:29,334 --> 00:25:30,501
Thanks.

225
00:25:30,503 --> 00:25:32,169
We're brothers.

226
00:26:00,399 --> 00:26:02,566
What was that?

227
00:26:18,616 --> 00:26:20,651
Perhaps we should wait till nightfall.

228
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:24,821
Some creatures fear the Moon.

229
00:26:24,823 --> 00:26:27,191
It would be safer.

230
00:27:20,678 --> 00:27:23,647
Ivar, it's me--
Hagen Grettison.

231
00:27:23,649 --> 00:27:26,717
My name is Steinar, son of Bagsecg.

232
00:27:26,719 --> 00:27:28,719
What the fuck are you doing here, prince?

233
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:35,025
You wanna fuck with me?

234
00:27:35,027 --> 00:27:37,594
I'll bet you do.
I'll bet you do.

235
00:27:37,596 --> 00:27:39,863
<i>Ivar, the King is dying.</i>

236
00:27:39,865 --> 00:27:41,632
We need your help.

237
00:27:43,001 --> 00:27:45,369
Everyone dies some time.

238
00:27:45,371 --> 00:27:47,404
How about you, prince?

239
00:27:47,406 --> 00:27:50,774
Do you want to die today?

240
00:27:50,776 --> 00:27:52,643
We seek the new King--

241
00:27:52,645 --> 00:27:54,544
Hakan.

242
00:28:07,925 --> 00:28:10,694
So you're looking for your brother?

243
00:28:17,969 --> 00:28:19,436
Know where he is?

244
00:28:19,438 --> 00:28:22,072
Why the hell would I tell you?

245
00:28:24,576 --> 00:28:26,543
Out of respect.

246
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:30,981
Respect is not a birthright, little prince.

247
00:28:30,983 --> 00:28:34,918
You want someone's respect,
you've got to earn it.

248
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:37,621
You want to earn my respect?

249
00:28:40,058 --> 00:28:43,660
You'd better be stronger than you look.

250
00:29:08,052 --> 00:29:10,821
- There has to be another way.
- He feels no pain.

251
00:29:10,823 --> 00:29:14,591
The only way he'll tell us is through choice.

252
00:29:18,029 --> 00:29:20,831
Three cups for your three chances.

253
00:29:20,833 --> 00:29:23,800
You win-- I'll tell you
everything you want.

254
00:29:23,802 --> 00:29:26,136
I win-- you drink.

255
00:29:26,138 --> 00:29:30,073
You drink all three--
you lose

256
00:29:30,075 --> 00:29:34,010
and you're mine for the night,
to do with as I see fit.

257
00:29:42,887 --> 00:29:45,622
Ah.

258
00:29:45,624 --> 00:29:47,824
First to fold or break.

259
00:29:51,129 --> 00:29:52,529
Begin!

260
00:29:53,931 --> 00:29:56,433
<i>Come on, Steinar.</i>

261
00:29:56,435 --> 00:29:58,168
- <i>Come on, Steinar.</i>
- <i>Put your shoulder into it.</i>

262
00:29:58,170 --> 00:29:59,903
- <i>Take him, Steinar.</i>
- <i>Come on, Steinar.</i>

263
00:29:59,905 --> 00:30:02,105
- <i>Come on.</i>
- <i>Take him.</i>

264
00:30:05,043 --> 00:30:07,077
Drink up, little prince.

265
00:30:16,187 --> 00:30:18,622
That'll put hairs on your ball sack.

266
00:30:21,993 --> 00:30:23,427
Tell me you have a plan.

267
00:30:25,863 --> 00:30:29,633
Shall we go again while our cocks
are still hard?

268
00:30:33,538 --> 00:30:36,473
First to fold or break.

269
00:30:36,475 --> 00:30:38,175
- Begin.
- Come on.

270
00:30:38,177 --> 00:30:40,177
- <i>Put your shoulder into it.</i>
- <i>Come on.</i>

271
00:30:40,179 --> 00:30:44,514
Come on!
Come on.

272
00:30:44,516 --> 00:30:46,917
<i>Come on, Steinar.</i>

273
00:30:50,588 --> 00:30:53,056
- Oh, fuck!
- Fuck.

274
00:30:53,058 --> 00:30:55,158
Two down,

275
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,927
one to go.

276
00:30:56,929 --> 00:30:59,663
What chance now, Princess, hmm?

277
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:25,255
Jokul, your belt.

278
00:31:25,257 --> 00:31:28,091
Give me your belt, quick.

279
00:31:28,093 --> 00:31:30,093
Your belt.

280
00:31:30,095 --> 00:31:33,063
Good, Steinar.
The serpent will protect you.

281
00:31:33,065 --> 00:31:36,099
With the Gods on your side,
you can't lose. Hmm?

282
00:31:37,768 --> 00:31:39,202
Yeah.

283
00:31:40,771 --> 00:31:43,073
We've got your back.
You know that.

284
00:31:43,075 --> 00:31:45,275
But the only way we'll stop him
is if we kill him.

285
00:31:46,277 --> 00:31:48,912
Ahh.

286
00:31:48,914 --> 00:31:53,283
I am looking forward to making a woman
out of you, Princess.

287
00:31:53,285 --> 00:31:56,152
Oh, don't look so sad.

288
00:31:56,154 --> 00:31:58,955
You might even enjoy it.

289
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:04,127
First to fold or break.

290
00:32:11,168 --> 00:32:12,536
Begin.

291
00:32:12,538 --> 00:32:14,671
Come on, Steinar, push!

292
00:32:14,673 --> 00:32:16,706
Come on, break his fucking wrist.

293
00:32:16,708 --> 00:32:19,576
Come on! Come on!

294
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:28,652
Oh. Oh. Argh!

295
00:32:33,891 --> 00:32:36,293
Ooh ooh.

296
00:32:36,295 --> 00:32:37,861
Ooh.

297
00:32:37,863 --> 00:32:40,263
What did you say your name was?

298
00:32:40,265 --> 00:32:42,032
Steinar.

299
00:32:42,034 --> 00:32:44,334
You're an asshole, Steinar.

300
00:32:47,738 --> 00:32:49,739
I like assholes.

301
00:33:07,625 --> 00:33:10,894
I didn't leave out of choice.

302
00:33:10,896 --> 00:33:15,265
I became persona non grata.

303
00:33:15,267 --> 00:33:18,134
That's latin.
Hakan taught me that.

304
00:33:18,136 --> 00:33:22,706
He's a prodigious man, a great man really.

305
00:33:22,708 --> 00:33:25,175
How come you're not with him now?

306
00:33:25,177 --> 00:33:29,613
You kill people in battle--
they love you for it.

307
00:33:29,615 --> 00:33:31,948
Make a mistake
with a couple of boys--

308
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:33,850
they treat you like a leper.

309
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:41,658
You all right there, Princess.

310
00:33:42,827 --> 00:33:45,195
Feeling
the shrooms-s-s-s?

311
00:33:49,267 --> 00:33:53,269
Ah, Hakan's not the man he was.

312
00:33:53,271 --> 00:33:56,106
Not a man at all really.

313
00:33:56,108 --> 00:34:00,076
You see, we're--
we're all this,

314
00:34:00,078 --> 00:34:02,078
but he--

315
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:06,416
he's all that up there,

316
00:34:06,418 --> 00:34:09,786
all around us.

317
00:34:09,788 --> 00:34:13,657
Do you think he is just gonna pack up
and follow you,

318
00:34:13,659 --> 00:34:16,926
rule the people that banished him?

319
00:34:16,928 --> 00:34:19,229
Why would he even speak to you, look at you?

320
00:34:22,299 --> 00:34:24,434
He already knows you're coming.

321
00:34:28,773 --> 00:34:30,306
Then he won't mind...

322
00:34:32,443 --> 00:34:34,678
if you tell us

323
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:36,780
where he is.

324
00:34:36,782 --> 00:34:40,216
But if I do that, you're going to die.

325
00:34:41,952 --> 00:34:44,688
Well, everybody has to die.

326
00:34:50,796 --> 00:34:53,196
Oh.

327
00:34:53,198 --> 00:34:55,832
Oh, fuck it, Princess,

328
00:34:55,834 --> 00:34:58,768
<i>I'll do better than
tell you where he is.</i>

329
00:35:00,738 --> 00:35:02,972
I'll take you there myself.

330
00:35:02,974 --> 00:35:05,208
Why the hell not?

331
00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:08,745
Why the fucking hell not, hmm?

332
00:35:28,466 --> 00:35:31,334
Ah.

333
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:52,455
Helps you see through the clouds,
to find the sun.

334
00:35:52,457 --> 00:35:55,024
- Is it magic?
- No such thing as magic.

335
00:36:07,838 --> 00:36:09,339
It's inscribed.?

336
00:36:09,341 --> 00:36:11,841
Yeah. Who taught you
to read?

337
00:36:12,977 --> 00:36:14,511
I was at a monastery.

338
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:18,114
They taught me...

339
00:36:19,784 --> 00:36:22,018
many things.

340
00:36:42,306 --> 00:36:45,475
Here, here you go.
Have this.

341
00:36:47,545 --> 00:36:50,046
You blow it.

342
00:37:00,858 --> 00:37:02,859
Boneless says there's a runestone

343
00:37:02,861 --> 00:37:04,861
2 days from here at the edge of a forest

344
00:37:04,863 --> 00:37:07,230
at the foot of the western mountains.

345
00:37:07,232 --> 00:37:10,133
Says he'll take us there
and the runes will lead us to Hakan.

346
00:37:10,135 --> 00:37:12,101
- And you trust him?
- Why not?

347
00:37:12,103 --> 00:37:14,571
- <i>Because he's a maniac.</i>
- <i>Oh yeah, that he is.</i>

348
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:17,841
But he's our maniac now.

349
00:38:05,656 --> 00:38:07,223
Vali!

350
00:38:07,225 --> 00:38:08,925
First the sun,

351
00:38:08,927 --> 00:38:10,660
and now the ashes painted red.

352
00:38:10,662 --> 00:38:12,362
Vali!

353
00:38:14,965 --> 00:38:16,466
Vali!

354
00:38:19,236 --> 00:38:21,304
- Steinar.
- Vali.

355
00:38:21,306 --> 00:38:23,006
- <i>Steinar.</i>
- <i>Are you all right?</i>

356
00:38:23,008 --> 00:38:25,408
What happened here?
What happened?

357
00:38:26,443 --> 00:38:28,044
Men came.

358
00:38:29,313 --> 00:38:31,381
Last night.

359
00:38:31,383 --> 00:38:34,083
I heard voices.
I thought it was you.

360
00:38:34,085 --> 00:38:36,085
How come there's not a scratch on you?

361
00:38:36,087 --> 00:38:38,221
It's another omen.

362
00:38:38,223 --> 00:38:41,391
We should turn back.
The Gods are against us.

363
00:38:41,393 --> 00:38:43,660
Who did this?
Thieves?

364
00:38:45,095 --> 00:38:47,630
Thieves would have taken all the horses.

365
00:38:47,632 --> 00:38:51,501
Someone trying to fuck with you.

366
00:38:51,503 --> 00:38:54,003
You wanna fuck with us?
Come on.

367
00:38:54,005 --> 00:38:56,239
Come on!

368
00:38:56,241 --> 00:38:59,475
Ivar, how long will it take us
to get there on foot?

369
00:38:59,477 --> 00:39:02,111
Depends how determined you are.

370
00:39:02,113 --> 00:39:04,280
Determined.

371
00:40:00,537 --> 00:40:02,605
We should wait for the Moon to guide us.

372
00:40:02,607 --> 00:40:04,640
Shut your mouth about the fucking Moon.

373
00:40:09,114 --> 00:40:11,214
Listen.

374
00:40:18,188 --> 00:40:21,224
Vali, you two, wait here.

375
00:40:46,817 --> 00:40:49,685
Fuck this.
Let's fight!

376
00:40:49,687 --> 00:40:51,120
Grim!

377
00:40:51,122 --> 00:40:53,056
Argh!

378
00:41:20,384 --> 00:41:22,285
Fuck.

379
00:41:57,888 --> 00:41:59,589
Steinar!

380
00:42:42,399 --> 00:42:45,168
Arghh!

381
00:44:33,710 --> 00:44:36,045
We should go after them, finish them off.

382
00:44:37,281 --> 00:44:38,547
We move on.

383
00:44:41,351 --> 00:44:43,452
I told you to wait.

384
00:44:43,454 --> 00:44:45,855
I'm not a child, Steinar.

385
00:44:45,857 --> 00:44:47,857
<i>Go and get the girl.</i>

386
00:44:47,859 --> 00:44:49,558
Now.

387
00:44:55,832 --> 00:44:57,967
<i>Steinar!</i>

388
00:45:02,673 --> 00:45:04,707
Steinar!

389
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:12,615
He died a good death,

390
00:45:12,617 --> 00:45:14,750
with his axe in his hand.

391
00:45:19,089 --> 00:45:21,324
Valhalla won't know what hit them.

392
00:46:32,729 --> 00:46:34,864
There's a clear view on the hill.

393
00:46:34,866 --> 00:46:36,999
Vali, get up there,

394
00:46:37,001 --> 00:46:39,402
shout if you see anything.

395
00:46:39,404 --> 00:46:41,704
How's Ivar?

396
00:46:41,706 --> 00:46:43,973
Nearly done.

397
00:46:46,743 --> 00:46:49,044
We need to move on as soon as we can.

398
00:46:49,046 --> 00:46:51,847
We have to reach Hakan.

399
00:47:55,612 --> 00:47:57,913
They were no ordinary Saxons.

400
00:47:57,915 --> 00:47:59,982
They were too well armed,

401
00:47:59,984 --> 00:48:01,684
too well trained.

402
00:48:03,487 --> 00:48:05,221
They didn't just run into us.

403
00:48:05,223 --> 00:48:07,156
You think we're being hunted?

404
00:48:09,226 --> 00:48:12,595
If Harald made an alliance with their King,

405
00:48:12,597 --> 00:48:15,264
then getting rid of me
would be part of the deal.

406
00:48:17,868 --> 00:48:20,069
They'd need to know where to look for you.

407
00:48:23,073 --> 00:48:25,207
Maybe someone's helping them.

408
00:48:25,209 --> 00:48:28,811
Don't tell me you believe in all that
crap about Moons and omens.

409
00:48:28,813 --> 00:48:30,779
I believe what I see with my own eyes.

410
00:48:30,781 --> 00:48:32,248
Right.

411
00:48:32,250 --> 00:48:33,983
Here.

412
00:48:35,552 --> 00:48:37,520
Vali dropped it.

413
00:48:39,089 --> 00:48:40,923
Look at the markings.

414
00:48:42,759 --> 00:48:45,528
It's a Saxon coin.

415
00:48:45,530 --> 00:48:47,963
You think Vali is a servant of our enemies?

416
00:48:47,965 --> 00:48:51,634
If he serves Harald, who himself serves
the Saxons, it amounts to the same thing.

417
00:48:51,636 --> 00:48:54,770
All from a piece of silver?
He's my brother.

418
00:48:54,772 --> 00:48:57,273
Half brother.
His mother's a Saxon.

419
00:48:57,275 --> 00:49:01,877
- Listen to yourself.
- You say you believe in reason and logic.

420
00:49:01,879 --> 00:49:04,280
When it's presented to you,
you turn your back on it.

421
00:49:04,282 --> 00:49:06,882
In what way do my actions
betray a lack of reason?

422
00:49:06,884 --> 00:49:09,084
You run when you should fight.

423
00:49:09,086 --> 00:49:12,221
You set off on this meaningless quest

424
00:49:12,223 --> 00:49:14,623
when you should be leading your people.

425
00:49:14,625 --> 00:49:16,625
And then you side with a bastard traitor

426
00:49:16,627 --> 00:49:18,627
who would stick a knife in your back,

427
00:49:18,629 --> 00:49:20,629
rather than your oldest friend.

428
00:49:20,631 --> 00:49:22,631
What would you have me do, huh?

429
00:49:22,633 --> 00:49:24,133
Hmm? Kill him?

430
00:49:24,135 --> 00:49:25,634
Better if you did.

431
00:49:25,636 --> 00:49:28,637
He's a child.
Think about that.

432
00:49:30,173 --> 00:49:33,309
Think about your two daughters.

433
00:49:33,311 --> 00:49:35,878
Dark times

434
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:38,681
call for dark deeds, Steinar.

435
00:49:39,916 --> 00:49:43,118
You're wrong, Hagen.

436
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:45,688
They call for light.

437
00:49:53,029 --> 00:49:55,798
Steinar!

438
00:50:03,607 --> 00:50:05,841
Come on.

439
00:50:11,815 --> 00:50:13,048
Hurry up!

440
00:50:30,066 --> 00:50:32,635
- We can't outrun them!
- I'll slow them down!

441
00:50:46,750 --> 00:50:47,916
Damn.

442
00:51:59,889 --> 00:52:01,490
What do they call you?

443
00:52:03,359 --> 00:52:06,295
Come on, you must have a name.

444
00:52:06,297 --> 00:52:08,230
Go fuck yourself.

445
00:52:11,034 --> 00:52:12,801
That's disappointing.

446
00:52:14,771 --> 00:52:16,805
I had expected more from a prince.

447
00:52:16,807 --> 00:52:19,308
Whatever deal you struck with my brother,

448
00:52:20,510 --> 00:52:22,010
it won't last.

449
00:52:22,012 --> 00:52:24,012
Brother.

450
00:52:30,887 --> 00:52:33,122
Right now

451
00:52:33,124 --> 00:52:36,492
we're in a position where
we can help each other.

452
00:52:36,494 --> 00:52:38,360
<i>I could help make sure</i>

453
00:52:38,362 --> 00:52:41,764
you become King of your people.

454
00:52:41,766 --> 00:52:44,900
We could forge a real alliance

455
00:52:44,902 --> 00:52:46,902
that could last generations.

456
00:52:46,904 --> 00:52:49,071
- Under the shadow of the cross?
- Under the protection

457
00:52:49,073 --> 00:52:51,974
of a benevolent King and a church

458
00:52:51,976 --> 00:52:54,777
that would encourage education and learning.

459
00:52:54,779 --> 00:52:56,779
Well, I can see the benefits

460
00:52:56,781 --> 00:52:59,047
in education and learning,

461
00:52:59,049 --> 00:53:01,283
<i>but when you start
talking about your God,</i>

462
00:53:01,285 --> 00:53:03,452
reason

463
00:53:03,454 --> 00:53:05,387
doesn't really come into it, does it?

464
00:53:16,566 --> 00:53:18,567
Think about it.

465
00:54:17,595 --> 00:54:21,597
Come on, just a sip.

466
00:54:39,483 --> 00:54:42,284
Cut my ropes.

467
00:54:42,286 --> 00:54:43,986
Watch out!

468
00:54:43,988 --> 00:54:45,587
Stab him again.

469
00:54:45,589 --> 00:54:47,923
<i>And again.</i>

470
00:54:49,025 --> 00:54:52,160
And again.
And again.

471
00:55:29,332 --> 00:55:31,033
You all right?

472
00:55:34,570 --> 00:55:36,405
What about him?

473
00:55:36,407 --> 00:55:38,540
Didn't like being tied up.

474
00:55:38,542 --> 00:55:40,609
Took one of the guard's ears off.

475
00:55:40,611 --> 00:55:42,311
Where's vali?

476
00:55:43,947 --> 00:55:46,081
He went with them to meet their holy men

477
00:55:46,083 --> 00:55:49,084
and bow down before the white Christ.

478
00:55:54,657 --> 00:55:56,158
Keep him alive.

479
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:57,726
We need him to tell us where we're going.

480
00:55:59,996 --> 00:56:03,298
- I'm not leaving without vali.
- Look, Steinar.

481
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:05,701
He denied the existence of the Gods.

482
00:56:05,703 --> 00:56:07,336
He begged to be converted.

483
00:57:12,769 --> 00:57:15,704
Let the boy go.

484
00:57:15,706 --> 00:57:19,441
You dare break the sanctity of the House of God?

485
00:57:19,443 --> 00:57:22,511
You talk of reason.
When it comes down to it,

486
00:57:22,513 --> 00:57:24,813
<i>you're just as superstitious
as the rest of them.</i>

487
00:57:24,815 --> 00:57:26,815
Now lay down your weapons

488
00:57:26,817 --> 00:57:28,817
and let the boy go.

489
00:57:43,599 --> 00:57:46,802
Oh, we will hunt you down

490
00:57:46,804 --> 00:57:50,272
and kill you like the godless animals you are.

491
00:57:50,274 --> 00:57:52,808
You go to such lengths

492
00:57:52,810 --> 00:57:55,844
to build these churches,

493
00:57:55,846 --> 00:57:59,181
making sure they strike terror

494
00:57:59,183 --> 00:58:01,583
into the hearts

495
00:58:01,585 --> 00:58:04,219
of all who come near.

496
00:58:06,289 --> 00:58:08,557
It's just a room with a door...

497
00:58:11,661 --> 00:58:14,129
no different to a prison.

498
00:58:15,465 --> 00:58:17,833
<i>Steinar!</i>

499
00:58:23,239 --> 00:58:25,740
Secure them inside!

500
00:58:25,742 --> 00:58:27,476
Get in!

501
00:58:38,521 --> 00:58:40,655
Do we have what we need to find Hakan?

502
00:58:47,530 --> 00:58:50,499
You were true to your word.

503
00:58:54,570 --> 00:58:57,672
Remember me to him, prince.

504
00:58:57,674 --> 00:59:00,642
<i>When you see him,</i>

505
00:59:00,644 --> 00:59:04,779
his eyes pierce the soul.

506
00:59:06,549 --> 00:59:08,550
He knows

507
00:59:08,552 --> 00:59:12,554
who you truly are, hmm?

508
00:59:12,556 --> 00:59:15,724
Like a God...

509
00:59:17,693 --> 00:59:19,528
sees men.

510
00:59:22,165 --> 00:59:25,634
You believe in the Gods, don't you, hmm?

511
00:59:25,636 --> 00:59:27,669
You believe in...

512
00:59:29,739 --> 00:59:31,806
Valhalla?

513
00:59:35,278 --> 00:59:37,913
Yeah.

514
00:59:37,915 --> 00:59:40,549
Oh.

515
00:59:40,551 --> 00:59:43,752
Valhalla, I'm coming.

516
00:59:58,467 --> 01:00:00,936
Shh shh.

517
01:00:29,298 --> 01:00:31,333
Whose was this?

518
01:00:33,002 --> 01:00:35,704
- It belonged to my mother.
- What happened to her?

519
01:00:35,706 --> 01:00:39,007
She was

520
01:00:39,009 --> 01:00:41,543
swallowed up into the darkness.

521
01:00:46,549 --> 01:00:48,683
Like everything else.

522
01:01:16,512 --> 01:01:19,414
- Are you finished?
- The boy.

523
01:01:19,416 --> 01:01:22,484
- <i>What about him?</i>
- <i>He went willingly,</i>

524
01:01:22,486 --> 01:01:24,853
prepared to accept the white Christ.

525
01:01:27,523 --> 01:01:30,825
It was that or death.

526
01:01:30,827 --> 01:01:33,628
You didn't yield and neither did we.

527
01:01:36,432 --> 01:01:38,867
And I won't now.

528
01:01:38,869 --> 01:01:40,669
Vali has brought us nothing but bad luck.

529
01:01:40,671 --> 01:01:42,304
If we offer him up as a sacrifice,

530
01:01:42,306 --> 01:01:44,939
the Gods will look over us
for the rest of our journey.

531
01:01:44,941 --> 01:01:47,776
It's worth it to safeguard
the future of our people.

532
01:01:47,778 --> 01:01:51,813
So long as there's men who think
like you, our people have no future.

533
01:01:51,815 --> 01:01:56,051
He's a traitor and a coward.
And he deserves to die.

534
01:01:56,053 --> 01:01:59,387
- Step aside, Steinar.
- Don't make me do this.

535
01:01:59,389 --> 01:02:01,856
Then you leave me no choice.

536
01:02:38,728 --> 01:02:39,961
Yield!

537
01:03:40,423 --> 01:03:41,689
No!

538
01:03:43,759 --> 01:03:45,460
No!

539
01:04:15,591 --> 01:04:17,592
What about the people in the church?

540
01:06:15,844 --> 01:06:17,345
Wait.

541
01:06:31,727 --> 01:06:33,728
<i>No, we shouldn't touch it.</i>

542
01:06:33,730 --> 01:06:35,997
I'm telling you, this isn't just
somebody's head on a stick.

543
01:06:35,999 --> 01:06:37,999
This is a sign.

544
01:06:38,001 --> 01:06:41,903
This is telling us to stay the fuck away.

545
01:06:41,905 --> 01:06:43,671
<i>Well, what is it?</i>

546
01:06:43,673 --> 01:06:45,940
It's a runestone.

547
01:06:45,942 --> 01:06:48,209
This is what Ivar was leading us to.

548
01:06:48,211 --> 01:06:52,180
This isn't good, Steinar, I'm telling you.

549
01:06:54,316 --> 01:06:56,818
To find Hakan, we had to find this first.

550
01:06:59,121 --> 01:07:00,388
What does it say?

551
01:07:03,325 --> 01:07:06,294
This isn't telling us how to find Hakan.

552
01:07:06,296 --> 01:07:08,863
It's a warning,

553
01:07:08,865 --> 01:07:11,232
saying what will happen if we try.

554
01:07:11,234 --> 01:07:13,334
Well, what does it mean?

555
01:07:13,336 --> 01:07:15,370
It means we're close,

556
01:07:15,372 --> 01:07:18,072
nothing more, nothing less.

557
01:07:18,074 --> 01:07:20,074
I can't go in there, Steinar.

558
01:07:20,076 --> 01:07:22,710
I just can't.

559
01:07:22,712 --> 01:07:25,980
- <i>Nothing to fear, Jokul.</i>
- <i>I know these things.</i>

560
01:07:25,982 --> 01:07:28,116
If I step foot in that forest, I'm dead.

561
01:07:28,118 --> 01:07:30,084
You'll be dead if you don't.

562
01:08:38,087 --> 01:08:39,821
Jokul.

563
01:08:43,959 --> 01:08:45,960
Agnes!

564
01:11:50,913 --> 01:11:52,980
You're not dead...

565
01:11:55,250 --> 01:11:57,218
Not yet anyway.

566
01:12:00,923 --> 01:12:04,358
You want to know why you're not dead?

567
01:12:04,360 --> 01:12:05,526
Huh?

568
01:12:07,596 --> 01:12:10,531
Huh? Huh?

569
01:12:13,135 --> 01:12:15,703
Because he chose it.

570
01:12:15,705 --> 01:12:19,407
He decides who lives, who dies.

571
01:12:24,212 --> 01:12:26,580
Who are you, huh?

572
01:12:26,582 --> 01:12:29,650
I am

573
01:12:29,652 --> 01:12:32,086
Ulric The Chronicler...

574
01:12:34,456 --> 01:12:38,259
a humble servant of the great master.

575
01:12:38,261 --> 01:12:41,262
Well, Ulric,

576
01:12:41,264 --> 01:12:44,498
if you wouldn't mind telling the great master

577
01:12:44,500 --> 01:12:47,268
that his brother's here to see him.

578
01:12:49,272 --> 01:12:51,973
He has no brother,

579
01:12:51,975 --> 01:12:55,276
no father, no mother.

580
01:12:55,278 --> 01:12:57,311
I'll tell him what you said though.

581
01:12:59,047 --> 01:13:01,349
It might amuse him.

582
01:14:05,247 --> 01:14:06,614
Vali?

583
01:14:09,218 --> 01:14:12,653
Vali, untie me.

584
01:14:18,226 --> 01:14:20,594
Vali, where's Agnes?

585
01:14:20,596 --> 01:14:22,430
<i>Where's Jokul?</i>

586
01:14:24,366 --> 01:14:25,566
Vali?

587
01:15:47,816 --> 01:15:50,851
You're a long way from home, Steinar.

588
01:15:52,454 --> 01:15:54,155
So is he.

589
01:15:56,758 --> 01:15:58,759
This is his home.

590
01:16:12,240 --> 01:16:13,807
Our father's dying.

591
01:16:17,879 --> 01:16:20,447
What do you see...

592
01:16:23,318 --> 01:16:25,653
when you think of home?

593
01:16:30,659 --> 01:16:33,227
I think of the...

594
01:16:33,229 --> 01:16:35,829
the blue of the sky,

595
01:16:35,831 --> 01:16:38,265
<i>the green
of the forest.</i>

596
01:16:41,236 --> 01:16:43,237
The smell of the pine trees.

597
01:16:47,842 --> 01:16:49,877
I see nothing.

598
01:16:53,615 --> 01:16:55,749
Nothing...

599
01:16:55,751 --> 01:16:57,851
but darkness.

600
01:17:09,931 --> 01:17:12,333
Why have you

601
01:17:12,335 --> 01:17:14,602
come here?

602
01:17:14,604 --> 01:17:16,470
<i>Our father sent me.</i>

603
01:17:16,472 --> 01:17:18,239
He sent me to bring you back...

604
01:17:20,442 --> 01:17:21,909
to lead your people

605
01:17:24,346 --> 01:17:25,813
as King.

606
01:17:28,917 --> 01:17:32,653
You don't know what you ask,

607
01:17:32,655 --> 01:17:35,322
but you will.

608
01:17:49,738 --> 01:17:52,573
Let the feast begin!

609
01:18:24,306 --> 01:18:27,775
Friends,

610
01:18:27,777 --> 01:18:32,813
- this is a momentous day.
- Yeah!

611
01:18:32,815 --> 01:18:37,918
This is a truly momentous occasion.

612
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:41,322
Commence the festivities!

613
01:18:51,666 --> 01:18:55,536
The people I arrived with--
what happened to them?

614
01:20:10,111 --> 01:20:12,880
Hey,

615
01:20:12,882 --> 01:20:15,816
how old were you when Hakan left?

616
01:20:15,818 --> 01:20:19,453
10, 11.

617
01:20:19,455 --> 01:20:23,123
Were you never curious as to why?

618
01:21:02,464 --> 01:21:04,231
I always loved you.

619
01:21:05,834 --> 01:21:08,535
I never wanted us to be separated.

620
01:21:10,638 --> 01:21:13,774
No mother would ever wish for such a thing.

621
01:21:16,711 --> 01:21:18,745
<i>But that's all
going to change now.</i>

622
01:21:22,050 --> 01:21:25,085
Now is the time for the world

623
01:21:25,087 --> 01:21:27,254
<i>to bow down
before his might.</i>

624
01:21:27,256 --> 01:21:29,590
Hakan! Hakan! Hakan!

625
01:21:29,592 --> 01:21:31,925
<i>All men will bow down before him.</i>

626
01:21:31,927 --> 01:21:34,127
Hakan! Hakan! Hakan!

627
01:21:34,129 --> 01:21:37,764
Hakan! Hakan!
Hakan! Hakan!

628
01:21:40,803 --> 01:21:43,871
Hakan! Hakan!
Hakan! Hakan!

629
01:21:43,873 --> 01:21:45,672
Bow down before the King!

630
01:22:22,544 --> 01:22:25,913
Hakan! Hakan! Hakan! Hakan!

631
01:22:25,915 --> 01:22:29,049
Hakan! Hakan! Hakan! Hakan!

632
01:23:03,651 --> 01:23:06,353
<i>Bow before him.
Kneel before your King.</i>

633
01:23:17,365 --> 01:23:19,266
Do you deny him?

634
01:23:22,704 --> 01:23:24,605
I deny him.

635
01:24:55,830 --> 01:24:59,266
You dare question your King.

636
01:24:59,268 --> 01:25:01,902
You dare question your God.

637
01:25:04,472 --> 01:25:07,140
Now your questions will be answered

638
01:25:07,142 --> 01:25:09,309
through his immortality...

639
01:25:15,416 --> 01:25:17,117
...and your destruction.

640
01:30:42,611 --> 01:30:44,611
Steinar.

641
01:32:28,449 --> 01:32:29,682
Steinar.

642
01:32:37,491 --> 01:32:39,792
<i>Well, where's Hakan?</i>

643
01:32:50,504 --> 01:32:53,206
He was sent to find his brother

644
01:32:53,208 --> 01:32:56,442
and he returns with his head in a bag.

645
01:32:56,444 --> 01:32:58,545
He was sent to find the King.

646
01:33:00,281 --> 01:33:02,415
Looks like he found one.

647
01:33:03,551 --> 01:33:05,952
How many people do we have in camp?

648
01:33:05,954 --> 01:33:09,822
600, 650.

649
01:33:09,824 --> 01:33:12,592
How many more could we muster by the morning?

650
01:33:12,594 --> 01:33:13,960
A few hundred more.

651
01:33:16,197 --> 01:33:18,331
And how far away is the saxon army?

652
01:33:23,370 --> 01:33:25,405
No more than a day's ride.

653
01:33:26,740 --> 01:33:28,975
Good.

654
01:33:28,977 --> 01:33:31,311
We leave at first light.

655
01:33:52,299 --> 01:33:53,800
Open your mouth.

656
01:34:07,915 --> 01:34:09,816
Swallow it!
