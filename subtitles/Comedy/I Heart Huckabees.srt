00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:12,920
Which part of your body are you going to emphasize?

3
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:14,400
I'm confident in everything.

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,800
I think I'll look good if I do this.

5
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,240
What is the prettiest part of my face?

6
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:21,550
My husband said he fell for my eyebrows. So do my eyebrows, and...

7
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:23,480
Make it as big as a 500 won coin.

8
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,190
You have to put on more.

9
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:28,980
- You must be a strange person who likes things like this.<br>- Bigger!

10
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:31,230
All done.

Get up.

18
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:33,160
Yi Suk. I want to eat something sweet.

19
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:38,210
Wait a minute. Wait.

20
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:40,300
Come out.

21
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,750
Wait a second.

22
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:47,210
What are you doing here? Did you come to see me?

23
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:52,350
I came here because I had something to say to this guy, but seeing how it is, there won't be any need.

24
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:55,110
Then, I'll go in.

25
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:58,820
Go in where? You want to go back there?

26
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:03,030
It seemed like it was a patient, so of course I should go. He can't see patients if I'm not there.

27
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:07,240
You say he can't see patients without you? You believe that?

28
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:10,190
Then what about that girl inside? What is she? Is she not a person?

29
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:13,050
There must be a reason. I'm going to ask.

30
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:14,910
Ask what?

31
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:18,530
It was very clear. Don't be like that.

32
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:21,650
Hey, Cha Hong Do, what are you doing?

33
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:24,460
Aren't you going to guard the hospital?

34
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:28,570
Oh, you look familiar. We've seen each other before, right?

35
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:33,540
Well, since we didn't even greet each other that day, you probably wouldn't remember.

36
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,230
What's that?

37
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:40,060
Hey, Ko Yi Suk!

38
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:45,100
I'll wait for you in the car, Darling.

39
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:49,130
What's with you? Why are you always hanging around here?

40
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:51,840
You're really a shameless bastard.

41
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,790
Hong Do, get in quickly.

42
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:56,640
Hey, Cha Hong Do, what are you doing?

43
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,200
Don't get involved and go!

44
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,960
How could you do that? That girl is your ex-lover, isn't she?

45
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,190
So what? Huh?

46
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:08,220
Get off! Can't you see I'm talking with this girl?

47
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:11,140
Is your decision already made?

48
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:16,010
Before asking anything, you just assume that I am an as*hole and you are the victim?

49
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:20,420
Fine. You were going to last only three months anyway.

50
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:22,400
Let's end it.

51
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:27,320
Hey, remove your car. Coming here with your shitty car...

52
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:03,870
As excepted, sweet things are great. It seems like my stress is all relieved.

53
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:05,970
You seem very at ease.

54
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:09,340
Why did you suddenly appear and make everything so noisy?

55
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:12,670
It's just I played a joke because I wanted to see you.

56
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:15,240
What kind of joke is that? Are you bored?

57
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:19,490
I feel so uneasy now that my wedding is soon.

58
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:21,490
So you came to brag about your wedding.

59
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:26,780
Hey, but what's with you hugging your ex-boyfriend so tightly.

60
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:29,260
I was almost flustered for a moment.

61
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:31,960
You were flustered? Did you miss me?

62
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,460
Tsch.

63
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:36,480
What? So you didn't even think about me at all?

64
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:39,790
What time would I have to think about somebody else's bride, when I need to take care of my girl?

65
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:41,900
Would that be a waste of time?

66
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:46,110
That's right. I like you because you're constant.

67
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:51,650
That girl who got angry in front of the hospital, that was the girl from that time, right?

68
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:53,310
Yeah.

69
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,390
Hey. But you must have some kind of problem, right?

70
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:03,090
You've been crossing your legs. It looks like you are worried about something.

71
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:05,010
What's going on?

72
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:09,280
Why? You seem like someone hoping that there'd be something wrong with my marriage?

73
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,070
No.

74
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:13,530
Actually, I came to play with you.

75
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:18,750
When I get married, I have to act like a good, faithful wife.

76
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:22,650
Then, I can't do that anymore. So I want to play with you, once.

77
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:24,480
What about you?

78
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,860
You changed your helmet.

79
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:40,850
It's cute. It looks like an egg.

80
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:45,810
I got a bandage.

81
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:49,430
I got hurt a little while trying to catch a criminal.

82
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:54,750
It seems like you get hurt at least once a year.

83
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:57,870
You suffered so much when you broke your ribs last time.

84
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:00,470
Ah that's true.

85
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,890
You remembered it all.

86
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:11,620
Ever since I was little, I always had the title of the eldest grandson, and so I grew up with a lot of attention.

87
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:17,170
When I got sick, the soup could be smelled across the whole town.

88
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:21,040
If they knew you were hurt like this, the whole neighborhood would've been in an uproar.

89
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:24,100
For sure. I won't be able to tell them.

90
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:28,590
Back then, that attention was so annoying and burdensome.

91
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:33,770
But still, it doesn't seem like you would have been annoyed, Detective Jang.

92
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,340
Because you're kind.

93
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:44,620
Hong Do, there's somewhere I'd like to go with you now. Is that okay?

94
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:46,940
I'm going.

95
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:55,030
How is it? Do you like it?

96
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:01,560
Your wedding is right around the corner, what were you doing, not even having chosen a bed yet?

97
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:07,240
I did choose one, at the price adding zero to the price of this bed.

98
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,490
Then why did you want to come here?

99
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:14,350
I just felt like it. Wondering how it would be if I was getting married to you.

100
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:17,550
I think about it when I see even just any man passing by.

101
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:21,000
What would it be like to get married to that guy?

102
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,830
Is it really right for me to get married now?

103
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:26,840
It's the typical marriage blues.

104
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:29,220
That's pre-wedding depression.

105
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:35,400
It will be gone when you get married. Just hurry set up a date.

106
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:40,950
I'm getting married and you don't even have an ounce of regret?

107
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:42,720
What if this marriage goes wrong?

108
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:47,560
That bastard. That bastard from a rich family. Don't you love him?

109
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,970
No.

110
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:56,180
I don't.

111
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:01,670
Please hold onto me, Yi Suk.

112
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:06,760
Special Sushi.

113
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,950
Th-thank you.

114
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:11,320
I'm more thankful.

115
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:15,450
It's nice to see you two. Play until morning. All the way till then.

116
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:17,310
Go, quickly.

117
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:20,680
This is really delicious.

118
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:24,530
He made it specially today, so eat and don't leave any.

119
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:26,190
Yes.

120
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:35,310
I think you got a text.

121
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:38,080
I'll eat well.

122
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:42,800
Are you waiting for Ko Yi Suk's call?

123
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,030
Do you still like him even though he was holding his ex in his arms?

124
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:55,970
Hong Do, he's the first man you went out with, right?

125
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:59,770
I really don't care what kind of person he is but,

126
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:03,110
I just wish you wouldn't get hurt.

127
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:06,190
I know you're worried about me.

128
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:10,440
But I'm not that innocent. I know a few things.

129
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,530
You really don't know about what's going on in the world.

130
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:16,660
Open your eyes and look at it realistically.

131
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:19,900
Does it really seem to you as if he cherished and loved you?

132
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:23,020
He's playing with you right now.

133
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:26,970
I know that, too.

134
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:31,360
That I don't match with him.

135
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,160
He wasn't holding another girl because you're lacking anything.

136
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,960
That's not what I'm saying at all.

137
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:44,300
I want to go home.

138
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,810
I'm sorry. Eat.

139
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:00,890
Why isn't she answering her phone?

140
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,900
<i>Helmet</i>

141
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:12,020
Oppa, do you know Detective Jang Doo Soo from the Gangnam police station?

142
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:13,490
How do you know that bastard?

143
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:16,780
So you really know him. How? Is he a friend of yours?

144
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:19,820
He was the detective in charge of the drunk driving accident.

145
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,500
He's the one I sued before.

146
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:24,110
That was Detective Jang?

147
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:29,590
That bastard, really. Why did you get involved with him?

148
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:31,980
That's enough. Don't even deal with a bastard like him.

149
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:35,540
You guys must have been in bad terms.

150
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:37,200
What's that on your clothes?

151
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,120
Oh! That's lipstick!

152
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:51,040
He-hello...

153
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:56,450
<i> Now you even get a woman's lipstick on your clothes? </i>

154
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:59,660
<i> You're so dirty. How can you get lipstick on your shirt?</i>

155
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:01,430
Who is it?

156
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:03,950
When did that get stained?

157
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:06,940
Did that happen on the bed?

158
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:09,740
<i> You are so shameless.</i>

159
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:12,680
Really, if you weren't my brother I'd...

160
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,730
Who is that woman, who is not careful?

161
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:18,620
<i> That's why I keep telling you to stop dating just anyone.</i>

162
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:21,460
<i> Is it an announcer? Did you get a new one again?</i>

163
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:24,710
Hey, please leave. I'm tired, hurry! Leave!

164
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:28,760
You would be tired, meeting all those girls...

165
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:33,020
Hey, after you wash up, draw some water for me.

166
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:36,570
Hello?

167
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:42,850
Hey, you didn't pick up the phone. Where are you?

168
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:45,070
Why did you call?

169
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:48,210
I'm giving you a chance right now.

170
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:53,830
You should have an explanation for getting in Detective Jang's car in front of me and leaving with him. Do you have nothing to tell me?

171
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:56,320
You said we should end it.

172
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,870
So it's the end? Really the end?

173
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:02,350
Why aren't you answering?

174
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:04,810
You heard what we were saying just then, didn't you?

175
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:05,860
I don't know.

176
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:09,960
When I was talking to my sister about the shirt and the lipstick?

177
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:14,920
Yes. Something about the bed and whatever. I heard it all.

178
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:19,380
Are you acting as if you didn't hear? Or are you just not interested in me?

179
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:22,870
Are you having fun, huh?

180
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:25,430
Your really looked down on me.

181
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:28,980
At least I ate something delicious with Detective Jang.

182
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:30,940
So, you like it?

183
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:35,080
Yes. But I was sad.

184
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,370
And angry.

185
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:45,380
I had decided not to get hurt again, but it is sad.

186
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:46,910
I'm hanging up.

187
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:49,880
Hey! Hey! Hey!

188
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:53,340
Who's the one who's angry?

189
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:59,320
Wow, this is the king of reversals. How dumbfounding.

190
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:08,320
Every time that girl comes, she doesn't even eat and runs away.

191
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,710
No matter how I see it, she doesn't seem interested in you.

192
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:16,260
It's not. I was wrong.

193
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:19,930
I did all I can do.

194
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:22,330
I don't know what more I should do.

195
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:26,890
Then, don't think about it and make progress with your body.

196
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:32,260
Like go and grab her wrist. Or say "be my girl!"

197
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:35,610
You are so nice. So frustrating.

198
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:39,730
I wish I could turn back time.

199
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:50,650
I'll be going now.

200
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:53,350
See you tomorrow.

201
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:59,940
Aigoo, grandma. I wish you'd be careful with the way you act.

202
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:04,440
I don't think that, but if Doctor Go and Se Ro

203
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:07,810
and the kids saw, they'd definitely misunderstand.

204
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:10,100
Misunderstand? What misunderstanding?

205
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,170
You didn't hear about it?

206
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:15,450
Our chairman with his charming, white hair

207
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:20,430
You were touching his hair, while saying that you will dye his hair or whatnot.

208
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:23,850
Then they'd think you're trying to seduce our Chairman!

209
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:25,850
Don't you think they'd see it like that?

210
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:30,030
No! No! What's wrong?! No!

211
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:34,180
So that you won't make men misunderstand, from now on,

212
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:36,600
be careful how you act. Understood?

213
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:40,580
Yes. I'll be careful. Good-bye.

214
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,840
Leave carefully.

215
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:01,220
I'm in front of Ko Yi Suk's house. I'll wait for you.

216
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:08,350
Madame Oh. You're going now? I'll take you.

217
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:10,910
Uh... it's enough.

218
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,790
You're a really difficult person.

219
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:17,150
Do you feel burdened? Or is it that you dislike me?

220
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:20,270
I'm a bit hurt, because you're always avoiding me.

221
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:23,340
Just think of me as a grandson and be comfortable.

222
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:26,270
It's because I'm thankful that you got my grandpa to laugh.

223
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:29,170
A man should not act so cheap.

224
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:33,720
Even if you are nice to a person, you could be misunderstood. You shouldn't be nice to everyone.

225
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:36,140
A man should stick to one person.

226
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:40,970
How are you just anybody? You're my grandfather's friend!

227
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:47,090
She's weird.

228
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:57,820
Detective Jang, what are you doing here?

229
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:59,460
I wanted to drop you off.

230
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:03,020
Detective Jang! That person is coming! That person is coming!

231
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:07,500
It's okay, it's okay.

232
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:14,900
So you came on your own feet. My body was feeling itchy today anyway.

233
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:17,810
You bastard, let's fight.

234
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:21,310
Madam Oh! How do you know this bastard? Is he your relative?

235
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:23,420
Does she have to tell you that kind of things?

236
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:28,420
It's just that it felt like someone who works at my house was caught by a gangster. It's not just one or two times.

237
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:32,460
You even dragged Cha Hong Do away in front of me. Is dragging women away your hobby?

238
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:37,550
- Then, what about you? Is making women cry your hobby? <br>- Detective Jang, aren't you going?

239
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:43,070
No, he is a neighbor. Detective Jang, let's go.

240
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:46,370
You take care of everyone in your town.

241
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:49,960
Coming with your shitty car...

242
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:53,470
Remove your car, quickly! So I can go.

243
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:07,760
<i>Timing and Subtitles brought to you by The ♥ to Heart Team @Viki</i>

244
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:16,850
I'm sorry. Every day...

245
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:18,590
I'm sorry.

246
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:22,760
Why are you apologizing when I'm the one who did wrong?

247
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:27,220
It's me who put you in trouble because I came and waited without telling you ahead of time.

248
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:30,540
You should be mad at me.

249
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:35,860
I don't have any right to say this. But it's because I hate it.

250
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:42,040
Ko Yi Suk's house, Ko Yi Suk's hospital, Ko Yi Suk's family. I hate that you're in all of these things.

251
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:44,010
I...

252
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:49,430
Today, I've thought about it.

253
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:55,290
I realized that I've been lying to people just for my own benefit.

254
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:59,370
That person. That person's Grandfather. And the family.

255
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:05,370
If they knew I'm not a granda but Cha Hong Do...

256
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:08,770
How betrayed they would feel.

257
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:15,900
After looking at myself all scared that he will found out,

258
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:21,230
I realized then, that I'm

259
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:24,580
doing something really bad.

260
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:31,600
Detective Jang... I'll take the bus.

261
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:37,230
You mean a lot to me, so

262
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:39,740
I don't feel comfortable.

263
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:45,470
I'm sorry.

264
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:48,230
I'll be quiet from now on.

265
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:51,270
Please feel at ease.

266
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:59,320
I mean, she asked me to treat her pre-wedding depression.

267
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:04,540
I knew girls were selfish, but isn't that being too shameless?

268
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:06,200
Weren't you going to give that to me?

269
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:10,420
- Here. Enjoy your coffee. <br> - Thank you. Do you want to try this?

270
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:13,210
Thank you, as expected.

271
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:17,840
Why are you grinning so wide?

272
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,230
Are you that happy that she's clinging onto you?

273
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:23,240
She wants to play.

274
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:27,620
Well, since she's about to marry, how Ko Yi Suk is the alpha male,

275
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:31,180
she is just realizing.

276
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:33,170
She wanted to play, there was no reason to refuse, was there?

277
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:35,940
That bullsh*t, really.

278
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:42,630
Hey, send that announcer to me. Play!? You're not even a kid, what do you mean play. Aigoo.

279
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:47,120
Eun Ho's eyesight came back.

280
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:50,390
She must feel a lot better after talking about her anger.

281
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:53,760
They are both getting better because she is getting consulted with Jin Ho.

282
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,300
The mother was so grateful she said she'd buy you a meal.

283
00:19:56,300 --> 00:20:00,480
The twins were fighting for their mother's attention.

284
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,410
They've grown a lot.

285
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,920
But did you counsel that TV presenter alone?

286
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,190
Yes. Why?

287
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:09,410
You were okay without Cha Hong Do?

288
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:13,490
Did your fear for patients subside?

289
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:16,160
That...

290
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,260
How can that be?

291
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:21,030
Is it because you didn't see her as a patient?

292
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,890
What are you doing? Go away.

293
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:35,570
What the heck, seriously.

294
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:38,530
Do you want to take a dump?

295
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:42,710
Hyung. I got myself into trouble.

296
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:45,310
What trouble.<br>- Last night.

297
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:48,690
You know I like girl groups. With them,

298
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:53,470
we had a group chat and I sent your picture.

299
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:58,710
You know the picture of you looking really handsome at the last sporting event. That one.

300
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:00,790
<i>[sigh]</i>

301
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:05,490
There's a girl in the group and she kept asking me to introduce her to my friend.

302
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:08,140
She said she's going to bring a pretty friend if he looks nice,

303
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:12,390
and send me a picture. Wow, she's really pretty, totally like Miss Korea.

304
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:14,810
So I sent her your picture, instinctively.

305
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:18,180
Hey, are you out of our mind? Sell me out to get yourself a girl?

306
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:20,420
Ridiculous punk.

307
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:22,110
Man.

308
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:24,140
Tonight at 7 o'clock.

309
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:29,530
Help me out! Don't just tell me to meet women.

310
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:39,740
Let's say hi.

311
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:45,070
It's me. Can you come over here after work?

312
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:47,090
<i>Play at the clinic?</i>

313
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:51,220
You said you wanted to receive my counseling.

314
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:53,830
Of course you have to pay the counseling fee.

315
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:56,660
Ex-girlfriend discount?

316
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:57,880
We'll see.

317
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:01,540
I'll see you after work. Okay.

318
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:12,370
Alright. Shall we start our own counseling session?

319
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:15,820
Have a seat. Come over here.

320
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:27,150
You did well/

321
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:28,750
Do what?

322
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:34,340
Going to a restaurant with Detective Jang was a bad move,

323
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:38,080
but going to a public restaurant.

324
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:40,480
Congrats.

325
00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:46,450
The girl I saw at the clinic last night. It's her, isn't she?

326
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:51,420
The one at the studio apartment last time.

327
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:56,100
I was hugging here here, alright. Got a lipstick mark too.

328
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,730
Why did she come?

329
00:22:57,730 --> 00:23:00,660
You heard it. To receive counseling.

330
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:02,150
But why here?

331
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:04,260
She's a famous person that everyone recognizes.

332
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:07,890
Would she go to another psychiatrists to get counseling?

333
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:10,680
I should give her the counseling.

334
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,520
Right. Go home once Yeon Woo gets here.

335
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,330
Why go home? You said she's coming to get counseling.

336
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:19,390
Me... Is it okay without me?

337
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:23,670
Hey. There's a place we need to go.

338
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:27,040
So let's head there. And you can go home straight from there.

339
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:29,320
Okay? Let's go.

340
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:34,180
What's he saying?

341
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:42,500
Miss Korea.

342
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:43,730
Get that away.

343
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:46,670
FYI, she's 23, in college. Young, isn't she?

344
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:49,090
Forget it.

345
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:53,240
Hyung. When are we ever going to meet college girls?

346
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:56,430
Hey. What am I supposed to do?

347
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:58,120
The date? You can just go out there.

348
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:00,600
No, waiting.

349
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:04,160
Waiting, keeping by her side. How do you do it?

350
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:08,520
So... You just need to be her shadow.

351
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:13,570
Whether it rains, snows, or the wind blows, you never get swayed

352
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:17,000
and you just need to stay by her side. Difficult, isn't it?

353
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,650
Shadow?

354
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:20,800
She's pretty though.

355
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,520
Tonight at seven.

356
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,310
Seven. Not much time left. Let's go.

357
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:26,420
Forget it!

358
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:30,280
First, let's visit the tasting booths.

359
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:34,920
If you go around this way, there's dumpling, sausage and all the other stuff. Go and eat them.

360
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:37,660
This isn't it. I can't.

361
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:39,610
What do you mean, you can't?

362
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:41,990
I absolutely can't!

363
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:44,820
I'll tell you how.

364
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:46,510
First, you just walk over there.

365
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:49,860
Keep on walking, without thinking. Got it?

366
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:55,930
Here. Just go. Keep walking forward.

367
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:57,530
Okay. Second,

368
00:24:57,530 --> 00:25:01,090
just go there and enjoy the food they give you. Isn't it easy?

369
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:04,510
Easy for you, but for me, it's not. It's only easy for other people.

370
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:06,570
Do you know how hard it is for me to be just standing here?

371
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:09,780
Are you really going to be like this? Don't you want to fix it?

372
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:12,060
Why does that announcer need counseling?

373
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:15,690
She's pretty and smart and doesn't have a disorder like I do.

374
00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:18,480
So why am I seeing you?

375
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,810
I guess it's strange for you too.

376
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:24,340
When a girl like Woo Yeon Woo is the right match for me. Right?

377
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:28,940
To date me, you have to do this like a piece of cake.

378
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:33,090
Okay? I'll demonstrate first. Take a look.

379
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:31,680
Is this too soon?

380
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:34,090
She should do this much though.

381
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:45,750
<i>Yi Suk. Take me!</i>

382
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:48,120
<i>Please take me!</i>

383
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:54,580
Here are dumplings. Try one, Ma'am.

384
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:56,580
Try one, Ma'am.

385
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:58,200
It's very good.

386
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,760
We have dumplings. Try one!

387
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:11,490
Hello.<br>- You can go home by yourself, right?

388
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:13,880
Why? Are you going somewhere?

389
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:16,430
I think something happened to Yeon Woo. Take a cab.

390
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:18,200
You can do that much.

391
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:22,220
You have to believe that you can do it.

392
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:24,980
Hello? Hello?

393
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:27,170
Hello?

394
00:27:27,170 --> 00:27:30,450
<i> There will be a special sale for ten minutes.</i>

395
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:34,120
<i> Just ten minutes! A beef set worth $100</i>

396
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:36,940
<i> To the first fifty customers...</i>

397
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:57,030
Don't pick up. I don't want to see anyone.

398
00:27:57,030 --> 00:28:00,910
No one. Go to a place where there is no one.

399
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:02,910
Quickly.

400
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:21,510

<i>Reporter Shin Na Ra reports.</i>

405
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,770
I don't remember it.

406
00:29:46,770 --> 00:29:49,430
I'm so embarassed I could die.

407
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:54,770
What hapened to me? Why am I like this, Yi Suk?

408
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:57,350
First, rest.

409
00:29:57,350 --> 00:30:00,200
You are not in a condition where I can check you right now.

410
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:05,170
How can I rest when the Internet and the broadcasting station are all going crazy!?

411
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:07,040
This is all because of you.

412
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:10,200
You always hurt my pride

413
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:14,880
So I wanted to meet someone better, get married and act proud.

414
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,360
But...

415
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:19,510
Why are all men like that?

416
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:24,510
My friend saw him coming out of a hotel with another woman.

417
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:27,970
I confronted him and he didn't even give any excuses.

418
00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:29,980
Throw away that kind of bastard.

419
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:33,550
Cancel the wedding. What's holding you back?

420
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:36,250
After I said I'd get married into a rich family

421
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:38,940
My mom and dad were so happy.

422
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:41,520
I don't know what to do.

423
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,380
I can't.

424
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:46,500
I can't go through this marriage.

425
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:54,560
We've been overworking with all that's been going on, so we're all still single. We shouldn't live like this.

426
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:57,520
So I've come up with the kind of man which the modern women prefer.

427
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:01,890
<i>Teens. If we mess with them, we're in big trouble. <i></i></i>

Yes, Cha Hong Do.

429
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:06,230
I'm sorry, but...

430
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:12,640
when you get off work, c-c-can you come here?

431
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,510
Where are you right now?

432
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:15,580
<i> I have a lot to say. </i>

433

<i>Timing and Subtitles brought to you by The ♥ to Heart Team @Viki</i>

434
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:37,610
Welcome.

435
00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:40,380
Excuse me. Where is the storehouse here?

436
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:41,280
What's the matter?

437
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,960
-A person is trapped in there. <br> -Huh?

438
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,300
Wait, but right now I...but...

439
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:48,500
Which way is it?

440
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,780
It's this way.

441
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:57,990
Hong Do, it's me! Are you inside?

442
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:02,720
Um...o-over here!

443
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,350
-The password. <br> -Okay.

444
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:06,290
It's open.

445
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,580
Hong Do, are you okay?

446
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:13,740
It's cold, right?

447
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,940
It must have been hard on you. What happened?

448
00:32:25,490 --> 00:32:27,310
It's...

449
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:32,360
It's not Ko Yi Suk's fault.

450
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:34,810
It's my fault.

451
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:40,560
That person told me to

452
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:43,380
believe that I can do it.

453
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:50,420
But I...I...just ran away because I was scared.

454
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:54,070
Let me just ask you one thing.

455
00:32:55,650 --> 00:32:57,810
Where is Ko Yi Suk right now?

456
00:32:57,810 --> 00:33:00,450
With a patient.

457
00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:04,890
He had something urgent to do with another patient so he went there.

458
00:33:04,890 --> 00:33:07,810
Your reply is suspicious right now.

459
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:14,010
I couldn't ask him.

460
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:18,810
If there really was something going on with that woman...

461
00:33:18,810 --> 00:33:22,310
Whether he was going to go back to her...

462
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:25,230
I was too scared so I couldn't ask.

463
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:31,900
Because I know all too well

464
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,900
that I don't match well with him.

465
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:38,120
Hong Do, you're not the type of person to be comparing yourself.

466
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:41,420
Why did you become like this after meeting Ko Yi Suk?

467
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:49,890
Here, wear this to sleep.

468
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:52,580
So you can leave me all alone?

469
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:55,260
So you can sleep comfortably.

470
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,660
Don't go.

471
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:12,640
What do you like so much about that girl? She's not even your type.

472
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:17,170
You're right. I even told her that.

473
00:34:17,170 --> 00:34:20,930
That there was no part of her I could possibly like.

474
00:34:20,930 --> 00:34:23,190
Then why?

475
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:26,610
I wasn't really sure all along,

476
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:35,700
but "this" was different.

477
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:38,660
With a person you really like.

478
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,780
Now I think I know.

479
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:45,220
Yi Suk, you're really cruel and petty.

480
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:48,680
That woman was real and I'm fake?

481
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:51,280
Sorry. Here.

482
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:56,630
Fine, go! Go away!

483
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:42,990
-Hello? <br><i> -Yeah.</i>

484
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:45,310
Where are you? At home?

485
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:49,450
Yes...

486
00:35:49,450 --> 00:35:53,810
Hey, why do you sound so down. Did you just wake up?

487
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:01,180
I sle...I slept...

488
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:03,640
You took a taxi home right?

489
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:04,910
<i>Yes.</i>

490
00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:07,320
How is it? Was it doable?

491
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:09,120
Um...

492
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:11,990
What happened to that TV presenter?

493
00:36:11,990 --> 00:36:13,330
Who do you think I am?

494
00:36:13,330 --> 00:36:18,570
Well, since she's my ex-girlfriend, I should treat her.

495
00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:26,070
Hey, Cha Hong Do. I'm going right now to meet you so don't fall asleep and wait for me.

496
00:36:28,990 --> 00:36:31,030
I'm sleepy though...

497
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:36,440
Wow, look at this woman playing hard to get.

498
00:36:37,870 --> 00:36:42,150
Fine. I'll let it go since today was a nervous day for you.

499
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:48,470
Since I don't think you'll be able to fall asleep if I tell you how I feel right now,

500
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:52,010
I'll see you tomorrow. Good night.

501
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,860
Hello?

502
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:00,980
I'm crazy, I'm crazy.

503
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:08,020
I'm talking about that ugly thing, Cha Hong Do.

504
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:24,640
What the? Why are you here again?

505
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:31,170
You bastard, hey! Hey!

506
00:37:31,170 --> 00:37:33,000
You need to get beat up you bastard.

507
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,480
You bastard! Bastard!

508
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,440
I'm going to...

509
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:41,080
Just!

510
00:37:43,550 --> 00:37:46,610
You're dead today. This bastard.

511
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,960
Come over here. Come here, here!

512
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:02,760
Come here!

513
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:17,540
-You're dead! <br> -Let go!

514
00:38:18,990 --> 00:38:21,890
It's all misunderstanding that arose while I was patrolling.

515
00:38:21,890 --> 00:38:24,070
We'll settle this and part our ways. So you can head out.

516
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:25,780
-Are you a detective? <br> -Yes.

517
00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:31,240
Do I look like I hit him? That bastard's the one who hit me first!

518
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:35,950
Catch that bastard! You guys are all gangster huh!?

519
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:38,870
-Be quiet! <br>-Hey, I'm going to sue!

520
00:38:38,870 --> 00:38:41,860
Hey! You're not catching him? Take him away!

521
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:45,620
This bastard, really!

522
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:47,470
Good work.

523
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:50,450
I'm going to sue you.

524
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:07,180
Hong Do

525
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:10,860
was left all alone.

526
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:19,760
At the storehouse. In that dark and gloomy storehouse, she was trapped inside alone.

527
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:25,650
Hey you bastard, I don't know if you think it's funny making a woman cry or be in pain,

528
00:39:25,650 --> 00:39:27,980
but I can't forgive that.

529
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:31,650
So please, please just piss off, yeah?

530
00:39:31,650 --> 00:39:35,350
Hey. Stop talking nonsense.

531
00:39:35,350 --> 00:39:40,340
Do you really even know how I feel?

532
00:39:50,530 --> 00:39:54,870
Hey, you already have that pretty and smart girl.

533
00:39:54,870 --> 00:39:57,500
But why is it Hong Do!?

534
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:00,370
That woman doesn't even know anything about Hong Do, right?

535
00:40:00,370 --> 00:40:04,550
If she doesn't know, are you going to tell her? What kind of policeman gives threats?

536
00:40:11,170 --> 00:40:15,570
Look at you...You're weak with alcohol.

537
00:40:15,570 --> 00:40:18,690
That's why you always causing trouble!

538
00:40:20,870 --> 00:40:25,670
No matter what you say, I choose Cha Hong Do.

539
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:26,950
Until when?

540
00:40:26,950 --> 00:40:27,910
What?

541
00:40:27,910 --> 00:40:31,920
Two weeks? One month? Can you even last three days?

542
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:35,080
This bastard's all talk.

543
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,910
Drink this all.

544
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:42,950
Look at him gulping it down.

545
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:50,140
I'm sure Hong Do will be the only one getting hurt.

546
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:54,230
But I won't just stand aside and look.

547
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:57,680
Before she gets hurt more, I...!

548
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:00,100
I'll put her back to what's originally her place.

549
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:01,100
Her original place?

550
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:04,150
Yes, her original place!

551
00:41:04,150 --> 00:41:06,710
how hard it is to get her out. what?

552
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:09,240
that woman, in that box again...

553
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:12,040
put her back in that box-like house again?

554
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:14,600
to give to who? to give to you?

555
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:19,270
You seem to be really misunderstanding.

556
00:41:19,270 --> 00:41:21,640
the original place is not that box,

557
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:25,280
It's also not next to you. But to me. Here!

558
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,020
Here, beside me.

559
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:28,800
That bastard, you're drunk.

560
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:31,270
Drink a bit more.

561
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,430
Drink.

562
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:36,350
Let's kill you for once today.

563
00:41:36,350 --> 00:41:38,690
Yeah, let's do that.

564
00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:44,700
grandma..

565
00:41:46,530 --> 00:41:50,220
I'm going to stop disguising as you, grandma.

566
00:41:51,030 --> 00:41:53,040
All that time...

567
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:57,050
I wanted to live and eat...

568
00:41:58,050 --> 00:42:00,210
So I only thought of myself.

569
00:42:00,210 --> 00:42:03,620
I think I didn't think about others.

570
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:09,900
I feel really sorry,

571
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:11,960
And I'm scared.

572
00:42:13,590 --> 00:42:18,660
So I'm going to stop pretending to be you, grandma.

573
00:42:19,930 --> 00:42:22,610
That's the right thing to do, isn't it?

574
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:34,190
Ko Yi Suk, are you playing with me?

575
00:42:35,570 --> 00:42:39,800
But I like you.

576
00:42:41,370 --> 00:42:43,900
Very much.

577
00:42:53,140 --> 00:43:02,780
<i>Timing and Subtitles brought to you by The ♥ to Heart Team @Viki</i>

578
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:20,010
What's that?

579
00:43:32,850 --> 00:43:34,900
Doo Soo?

580
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:40,670
Doo Soo Jang! Did you sleep in my brother's room?

581
00:43:40,670 --> 00:43:43,430
Your hair is cute. Ah, you smell of alcohol!

582
00:43:43,430 --> 00:43:45,970
What happened? Did you drink with my brother?

583
00:43:45,970 --> 00:43:47,860
I'm a bit late. I have to go quickly, so see you next time.

584
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:51,880
That's right, I got a role. Would it be okay to get some experience at your police station?

585
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:54,750
We're going to start shooting soon, and I won't be able to do it for long, so it will be for about a week.

586
00:43:54,750 --> 00:43:58,290
If you send the forms to the police station, the general affairs department will take care of it for you, so please do that.

587
00:43:58,290 --> 00:44:01,540
Who doesn't know that? It's because I don't have time.

588
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:05,010
That's the good thing about knowing people. You can help each other in need.

589
00:44:05,010 --> 00:44:08,280
And you! You don't have a girlfriend, do you?

590
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:09,940
I already told you there's someone I like.

591
00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:11,840
I don't think that's true.

592
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:14,450
I've investigated in many different aspects and

593
00:44:14,450 --> 00:44:16,970
You don't seem bad, even for a marriage.

594
00:44:16,970 --> 00:44:20,530
You and me are also very compatible.

595
00:44:20,530 --> 00:44:24,040
Compatible? What are you saying?

596
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:28,260
Does it seem like a joke? I'm not joking.

597
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:32,960
I am a very impetuous and straightforward person,

598
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:37,750
But you're the first man I know to accept it all like that.

599
00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:43,400
"Do whatever you want, and I'll accept it all." That kind of impression.

600
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:48,900
Will you realize it if I do this?

601
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:54,210
Aigoo, oh my word! What are you doing? At the house at that!

602
00:44:54,210 --> 00:44:55,940
How can you so easily...

603
00:44:55,940 --> 00:44:58,920
Hello. I'm Jang Doo Soo.

604
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:03,550
I don't remember it very well, but I think took advantage of your hospitality. Really, I'm sorry.

605
00:45:03,550 --> 00:45:06,140
Ahjuma, how is he? He's my brother's friend, right?

606
00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:10,460
I don't know about that but I I saw him with your brother

607
00:45:10,460 --> 00:45:14,250
I saw him crawl home last night dead drunk.

608
00:45:14,250 --> 00:45:16,400
I am very sorry.

609
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:21,110
I'll be going now, then. Goodbye.

610
00:45:21,110 --> 00:45:24,350
The bean sprouts fell.

611
00:45:24,350 --> 00:45:27,030
I'll come to the police station!

612
00:45:27,030 --> 00:45:28,400
Why to the police station, again?

613
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:31,300
I got a new role, and it's a female police officer.

614
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:33,290
I want to get a hands-on experience.

615
00:45:34,430 --> 00:45:37,210
What a good morning!

616
00:45:38,690 --> 00:45:42,090
Who are you calling first thing in the morning?

617
00:45:42,090 --> 00:45:44,780
You know Sam Dam's president, right?

618
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:47,500
The one who used to own a rice store, located right next to your store a long time ago.

619
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:51,390
It's his eightieth birthday this weekend, so for the Jang Yoon Jeong dinner show,

620
00:45:51,390 --> 00:45:54,370
he's sending an invitation. He's sending two tickets,

621
00:45:54,370 --> 00:45:56,500
so he said you should bring your girlfriend.<br>- What?

622
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:59,690
He told me to bring this?

623
00:45:59,690 --> 00:46:04,030
You should go. I heard it's difficult to get a hold of those tickets.

624
00:46:04,030 --> 00:46:08,570
Where would I be going all alone?

625
00:46:08,570 --> 00:46:11,130
Then can I take those tickets?

626
00:46:11,130 --> 00:46:14,290
I love seeing those kinds of things alone.

627
00:46:14,290 --> 00:46:16,870
I know you love being alone, but

628
00:46:16,870 --> 00:46:20,350
Why are you taking something that's for me?

629
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:26,990
What about giving Madam Oh a fancy dress as a nice gift?

630
00:46:26,990 --> 00:46:31,830
If she wore it to go see a certain singer's show, it would be really nice.

631
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:34,270
Okay, I got it, well...

632
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:44,040
ah.. my head..

633
00:46:56,790 --> 00:46:59,350
Where did that bastard go?

634
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:01,760
Has he left?

635
00:47:06,570 --> 00:47:11,450
Instead of me, she sent an S.O.S. to Detective Jang, is that right?

636
00:47:17,250 --> 00:47:18,830
There's none.

637
00:47:20,260 --> 00:47:25,060
If not a call, then there should at least be a text message.

638
00:47:25,060 --> 00:47:31,680
Well, Detective Jang would be more comfortable than me, since he's good to her.

639
00:47:40,350 --> 00:47:42,190
Hello?

640
00:47:42,190 --> 00:47:45,090
Hey, I have something to say, so come out.

641
00:47:45,090 --> 00:47:47,410
now?

642
00:47:47,410 --> 00:47:50,310
Did you forget I had another part time job on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday mornings?

643
00:47:50,310 --> 00:47:53,370
Just what is that Monday, Wednesday, and Friday part-time job?

644
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:54,700
Where are you?

645
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:55,990
Why?

646
00:47:55,990 --> 00:48:00,130
Come to the hospital when you get off work. I have something to say.

647
00:48:00,130 --> 00:48:02,900
Don't I always do that?

648
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:04,900
Okay.

649
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:14,530
This woman. She's not letting it out.

650
00:48:16,870 --> 00:48:20,560
Ah, that was that.

651
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:24,120
That voice she had on the phone yesterday.

652
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:27,850
Ah, she cried.

653
00:48:30,270 --> 00:48:33,310
Why doesn't she tell me?

654
00:48:39,690 --> 00:48:45,180
Hello? What is it, Butler Ahn?

655
00:48:45,180 --> 00:48:49,350
What? Evening work, you say?

656
00:48:51,430 --> 00:48:56,200
Well then, it would be better after six o'clock.

657
00:48:56,200 --> 00:49:00,120
Ah, I got it. Yes.

658
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:05,780
Ah, my body.

659
00:49:06,820 --> 00:49:11,070
My body's aching all over.

660
00:49:11,070 --> 00:49:14,170
Ahjumeoni, did everyone go somewhere? Why is nobody here?

661
00:49:14,170 --> 00:49:17,350
They went out, and Se Ro went out too.

662
00:49:17,350 --> 00:49:20,170
You need to keep Se Ro under control.

663
00:49:20,170 --> 00:49:25,770
I don't know if it's because she's lived in America, but going around everywhere...smooch, smooch, smooch...

664
00:49:25,770 --> 00:49:26,790
What?

665
00:49:26,790 --> 00:49:30,950
That friend you came with yesterday, he's dating with Se Ro, right?

666
00:49:30,950 --> 00:49:34,040
That's exactly how it looked.

667
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:36,140
A friend?

668
00:49:36,980 --> 00:49:41,190
Detective Jang? Hey, Ahjumeoni, you must have seen wrong.

669
00:49:41,190 --> 00:49:46,770
Seriously. How can the chairman be so indifferent?

670
00:49:46,770 --> 00:49:50,080
He knows full well that I like Jang Yoon Jeong,

671
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:52,710
but he's going with that old lady Madam Oh or whatever

672
00:49:52,710 --> 00:49:55,050
to see the Jang Yoon Jeong show.

673
00:49:55,050 --> 00:50:01,600
Ey~ So now you're upset? I'll get you the tickets immediately. Don't worry.

674
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:04,240
Do you think I'm doing right now this because of the tickets?

675
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:09,310
I have money too! Don't you think I could get a hundred tickets or ten tickets if I wanted to?

676
00:50:09,310 --> 00:50:12,270
I don't want to see you, so go over there.

677
00:50:12,270 --> 00:50:15,930
Just eat pollack soup in a little bit. Aigoo.

678
00:50:28,740 --> 00:50:30,620
You're here?

679
00:50:32,580 --> 00:50:34,940
You still haven't thrown it away.

680
00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:40,460
So we finally get to eat breakfast together?

681
00:50:40,460 --> 00:50:43,520
I already ate breakfast.

682
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:45,780
You're still the same.

683
00:50:48,590 --> 00:50:50,830
I spent the night thinking.

684
00:50:50,830 --> 00:50:55,430
Even if I ask anyone on the streets, their answers will probably be the same.

685
00:50:55,430 --> 00:50:57,850
I think it's right to end it.

686
00:50:59,380 --> 00:51:03,620
But I... didn't know that I was such a materialistic person.

687
00:51:03,620 --> 00:51:09,160
If dreaming of marrying a chaebol is being materialistic, then all the women in the world are materialistic.

688
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:12,560
Then what do I do? Not get married?

689
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:15,660
Do it. Get married and get a divorce.

690
00:51:15,660 --> 00:51:19,520
With evidence of his cheating, get a huge alimony payment from him.

691
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:20,620
Are you really a doctor?

692
00:51:20,620 --> 00:51:24,360
This is something that no one can do for you.

693
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:27,260
The only thing I can tell you is this :

694
00:51:27,260 --> 00:51:31,780
Whatever you choose, give it your all in that decision.

695
00:51:31,780 --> 00:51:35,560
That's the way you'll live, okay?

696
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:37,540
Eat that.

697
00:51:49,010 --> 00:51:51,850
Even if you're not the best doctor in this world

698
00:51:51,850 --> 00:51:54,730
Even if you're a psycho, a player and a crook, you have to fix me.

699
00:51:54,730 --> 00:51:57,270
Otherwise, otherwise, you're...

700
00:51:57,270 --> 00:52:01,130
Otherwise... I'm gonna die right here.

701
00:52:02,070 --> 00:52:04,670
Please fix me.

702
00:52:18,540 --> 00:52:22,000
♫<i> I'm in love. </i>♫

703

It's really you.

711
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:05,420
What are you doing here?

712
00:53:05,420 --> 00:53:09,910
I was on my way to work and I thought I should come to thank you.

713
00:53:09,910 --> 00:53:12,110
I thought about just texting you...

714
00:53:12,110 --> 00:53:14,490
If you'd done that, I'd have been resentful.

715
00:53:14,490 --> 00:53:17,030
Thank you.

716
00:53:17,050 --> 00:53:19,890
That kind of thing won't happen again.

717
00:53:19,890 --> 00:53:22,390
I'm sorry that I was bothersome.

718
00:53:22,390 --> 00:53:25,650
Why are you saying that when you know it wasn't bothersome at all?

719
00:53:26,410 --> 00:53:34,510
Far from being bothersome, since you looked for me, I thought, "Ah, Hong Do hasn't forgetten about me completely", so I was comforted.

720
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:37,960
I was really happy yesterday.

721
00:53:39,100 --> 00:53:43,500
Happy that there was still something I could do for you.

722
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:48,880
Hong Do, you said that I was in your heart for the last seven years, right?

723
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:53,340
Do you know what the motto of the Gangnam police is?

724
00:53:53,340 --> 00:53:56,500
It's, "The tenacious detective wins."

725
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:59,120
I'm really tenacious.

726
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:03,200
Wait and see. Right now is the start of seven years for me.

727
00:54:05,140 --> 00:54:07,140
Is that burdensome?

728
00:54:08,140 --> 00:54:10,620
Don't feel burdened.

729
00:54:11,460 --> 00:54:14,400
You just need to think of it as winning the loto.

730
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:16,860
You get a bonus, and you get to do something meaningful.

731
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:19,590
You said you wanted to make an event, right?

732
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:23,840
It's an event. He's going to give us a bonus.

733
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:25,140
I'm counting on you.

734
00:54:25,140 --> 00:54:29,460
-These workers are the best in... <br> -Beauty.

735
00:54:29,460 --> 00:54:31,610
The enthusiastic ones, the ones who do a good job.

736
00:54:31,610 --> 00:54:33,320
Yes.

737
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:37,400
Then I will touch up everyone's faces.

738
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:38,660
You can knead them until they pop.

739
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:41,060
Touching it, then?

740
00:54:42,060 --> 00:54:42,840
Do well.

741
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:44,920
Yes, of course. Fighting!

742
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:47,200
Hwaiting!

743
00:54:48,950 --> 00:54:50,930
It's this way.

744
00:54:52,890 --> 00:54:58,050
Here. I think it's across from here. Let's see...

745
00:55:00,550 --> 00:55:05,190
There. It's that house.

746
00:55:06,530 --> 00:55:09,230
I'll wait here.

747
00:55:09,230 --> 00:55:10,450
Go and give it to her.

748
00:55:10,450 --> 00:55:12,430
Why? Let's go together!

749
00:55:12,430 --> 00:55:15,010
When Madam Oh sees these clothes, she'll be really happy.

750
00:55:15,010 --> 00:55:17,090
Don't you want to see her happy face?

751
00:55:17,090 --> 00:55:21,150
When we go see the Jang Yoon Jeong show, I'll see it all anyway.

752
00:55:21,150 --> 00:55:22,790
Just go and give it to her.

753
00:55:22,790 --> 00:55:24,730
And... wait, wait.

754
00:55:24,730 --> 00:55:28,790
Don't throw it to her as if you're handling a bag of chips

755
00:55:28,790 --> 00:55:31,390
but deliver it gently.

756
00:55:31,390 --> 00:55:34,710
Yes. I'll go quickly.

757
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:39,840
So she lived in that kind of place.

758
00:55:48,230 --> 00:55:50,530
Who is this?

759
00:55:50,530 --> 00:55:52,130
Huh?

760
00:55:53,530 --> 00:55:56,410
What? He died?

761
00:55:56,410 --> 00:55:58,950
Where's the morgue?

762
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:03,160
This punk.

763
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:12,300
Chairman! Chairman!

764
00:56:20,270 --> 00:56:22,610
Did you come after your part time job?

765
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:35,640
All this time... were you playing with me?

766
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:36,440
What?

767
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:40,180
Did you get tired of always meeting pretty and well-off girls,

768
00:56:40,180 --> 00:56:42,760
Since I'm a girl who's ugly,

769
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:46,420
uneducated and pathetic enough to have anthrophobia too...

770
00:56:46,420 --> 00:56:51,720
Did you find it interesting and new, so you decided to play with me?

771
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:53,690
How is it, after playing with me for a few days?

772
00:56:53,690 --> 00:56:57,490
Are you sick of it again? Or is it since you met another smart and pretty girl again

773
00:56:57,490 --> 00:57:00,330
do you feel like I'm really not the one?

774
00:57:00,330 --> 00:57:03,170
How is it? What are you going to do now?

775
00:57:03,170 --> 00:57:06,470
Now you've gotten the courage to ask?

776
00:57:06,470 --> 00:57:08,950
That inferiority complex of yours, it's pretty considerable.

777
00:57:08,950 --> 00:57:12,650
Yes, I'm asking you now because I'm foolish.

778
00:57:12,650 --> 00:57:14,010
Answer me.

779
00:57:14,010 --> 00:57:15,750
Let's go out. We have somewhere to go.

780
00:57:15,750 --> 00:57:18,600
Were you lying about doing counseling with that woman

781
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:20,900
Even though you say you can't counsel without me?

782
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:25,980
You're really stupid. How did you go to medical school with that brain?

783
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:30,920
It's just that I wanted to try it once because it seemed I could maybe do it even without you.

784
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:34,480
What am I lacking, that I would lie to you?

785
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:36,180
So...

786
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:40,820
Was it okay?

787
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:44,620
No. I almost died.

788
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:50,840
I can't do it without you.

789
00:57:54,670 --> 00:57:57,030
Why are you crying?

790
00:58:02,470 --> 00:58:04,310
Let's go.

791
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:22,790
Don't worry. No matter who calls, I won't go this time.

792
00:58:22,790 --> 00:58:25,110
Let's go. Go.

793
00:58:27,220 --> 00:58:30,640
The mandus are on sale, the mandu!
