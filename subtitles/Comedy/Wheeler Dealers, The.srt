SPEND THE NIGHT?

160
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:55,696
ON THE GOOD SHIP
LOLLIPOP?

161
00:08:55,731 --> 00:08:57,165
NO. WENT TO A GALLERY
WITH LEONARD.

162
00:08:57,233 --> 00:08:59,199
A NEW ARTIST HE THINKS
IS THE COMING THING.

163
00:08:59,267 --> 00:09:00,799
LEONARD STILL HAVING
HIS PROBLEMS?

164
00:09:00,867 --> 00:09:02,266
STILL SEEING
THAT PSYCHIATRIST?

165
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,465
YOU'D HAVE PROBLEMS, TOO,

166
00:09:03,533 --> 00:09:05,399
IF YOU WERE MARRIED TO THAT
WOMAN HE WAS MARRIED TO.

167
00:09:05,466 --> 00:09:07,732
WELL, I'VE HAVE PROBLEMS
MARRIED TO ANY WOMAN.

168
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:11,032
OH, ISN'T IT AMAZING HOW I
SPARKLE SO EARLY IN THE MORNING?

169
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,165
WHY BOTHER SPARKLING?

170
00:09:12,233 --> 00:09:14,232
WHEN A GIRL SPARKLES
DOWN ON WALL STREET,

171
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:15,399
SHE'S A THREAT.

172
00:09:15,466 --> 00:09:18,699
WHEN SHE SPARKLES UPTOWN,
IN MY TERRITORY,

173
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:20,036
SHE'S A PROMISE.

174
00:09:20,071 --> 00:09:22,465
I'LL STAY DOWNTOWN,
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

175
00:09:22,533 --> 00:09:24,599
YOU BETTER QUIT SPARKLING
FOR LEONARD.

176
00:09:24,666 --> 00:09:26,465
YOU WON'T GET ANYWHERE
WITH HIM.

177
00:09:26,533 --> 00:09:28,565
A HEADSHRINKER'S
TOO MUCH COMPETITION.

178
00:09:28,633 --> 00:09:30,565
IT PUTS A THIRD PARTY
IN THE ACTION.

179
00:09:30,633 --> 00:09:32,332
LEONARD'S A PASTIME,
NOT A PROJECT.

180
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,165
IT'S COMFORTABLE
TO HAVE HIM AROUND.

181
00:09:34,233 --> 00:09:36,232
HE HELPS ME WARD OFF
THE GRABBERS.

182
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,632
I'VE GOT TO RUN,
SO I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

183
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,799
NOW, YOU SEE, IF YOU WORKED
UPTOWN INSTEAD OF DOWN,

184
00:09:40,867 --> 00:09:42,432
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TO BOLT
SO EARLY.

185

WE COULD SHOP AT BONWITS
AT LUNCHTIME.

186
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:48,032
OH, UPTOWN IS JUST
A STATE OF MIND.

187
00:09:50,733 --> 00:09:52,132

WE WENT DOWN THE LINE
WITH YOU THIS YEAR,

194

PART OWNERSHIP IN SIX OF THE
DEEPEST, DRIEST HOLES IN TEXAS.

195

HOW ABOUT THE SEVEN WELLS
WE BROUGHT IN TWO YEARS AGO?

197

198

MAYBE YOU'RE LOOSING YOUR TOUCH.

UNDERCURRENTS, HENRY.

200

UNDERCURRENTS ANYMORE.

WHEN YOU HAD ALL THOSE SURPLUS
AIRPLANES YOU COULDN'T UNLOAD,

203
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:24,615
- YOU SAID, "SEND THEM TO
THE JUNKMAN," RIGHT?
- RIGHT.

204

WELL, JUST WHO WAS IT THAT SOLD
THEM AS AN AIR FORCE

205

TO A CERTAIN UNNAMED PARTY
IN CENTRAL AMERICA?

206

BUT WE GOT PAID
IN BANANAS.

207

YEAH, AND YOU FERRIED
THOSE BANANAS ON YOUR AIRLINE

208

AND CLEARED HALF A MILLION
DOLLARS, RIGHT?

AND YOU, FLINK.

210

00:10:38,482 --> 00:10:40,934
ONTO THOSE 40,000
OBSOLETE JAPANESE CAMERAS?

212
00:10:40,969 --> 00:10:42,086
YOU DID, HENRY,
BUT I --

213
00:10:42,121 --> 00:10:44,285
I MADE YOU THE FIRST
AMERICAN IN HISTORY

214
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,757
TO EXPORT JAPANESE CAMERAS
TO JAPAN.

215
00:10:46,792 --> 00:10:48,553
I DIDN'T MAKE BEANS
ON THAT DEAL.

I SURE AM.

679
00:30:58,533 --> 00:31:00,165
THAT CHICKEN'S THE MOST
I'VE HAD TO DRINK

681
00:31:01,433 --> 00:31:03,199
NOW, MR. TYROON,
LET'S GET BACK TO BUSINESS,

682
00:31:03,266 --> 00:31:05,532
BECAUSE I KNOW YOU WANT TO HEAR
ABOUT WIDGETS.

683
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,032
I SURE DO.

684
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:10,032
HOW DID A GIRL LIKE YOU
EVER GET MIXED UP WITH WIDGETS?

685
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:12,699
YOU MEAN WHAT AM I DOING
ON WALL STREET,

686
00:31:12,766 --> 00:31:14,165
AND HOW COME
I'M NOT MARRIED?

687
00:31:14,233 --> 00:31:17,665
WELL, NOW, I WASN'T GONNA GET TO
THAT FOR ANOTHER HOUR OR SO.

688
00:31:17,733 --> 00:31:19,799
I'M IMPRESSED
BY YOUR DIRECTNESS.

689
00:31:19,866 --> 00:31:21,699
MR. TYROON,
GETTING MARRIED

690
00:31:21,766 --> 00:31:24,099
IS NOT THE ONLY THING
A GIRL CAN DO.

691
00:31:24,166 --> 00:31:25,265
AND I LIKE WALL STREET,

692
00:31:25,333 --> 00:31:27,232
AND I WANT TO SEE GIRLS
ACCEPTED THERE.

693
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:29,199
WELL, YOU MEAN
THEM FELLAS DOWNTOWN

694
00:31:29,266 --> 00:31:30,532
ARE GIVING YOU
A HARD TIME?

695
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:33,099
UH-HUH, AND IF I CAN PUT WIDGET
OVER, I'M ON MY WAY.

696
00:31:33,166 --> 00:31:37,165
I MAY EVEN BE THE NEXT PRESIDENT
OF THE WOMEN SECURITY ANALYSTS.

697
00:31:37,233 --> 00:31:39,732
WELL, SINCE WE'RE DOING
ALL THIS SO SPEEDY-LIKE,

698
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:42,699
THIS LEONARD,
IS HE YOUR STEADY FELLA?

699
00:31:42,766 --> 00:31:44,032
OH, NO, NO. NO.

700
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:46,165
NO. I-I SEE A LOT OF HIM.

701
00:31:46,233 --> 00:31:48,732
HE'S AN ART CRITIC
AND VERY INTELLIGENT.

702
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,799
AND YOUR NEXT QUESTION
IS GOING TO BE

703
00:31:50,866 --> 00:31:52,132
HOW LONG
HAVE I KNOWN HIM.

704
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,665
WHOO-EE.

705
00:31:53,733 --> 00:31:55,665
THERE'S NO POINT
IN MESSING WITH YOU.

706
00:31:55,733 --> 00:31:57,466
YOU'RE AHEAD OF ME
ALL THE WAY.

707
00:31:57,533 --> 00:32:00,232
I'M JUST NOT USED TO
BRIGHT GIRLS.

708
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,799
OH, YOU REALLY THINK
I'M BRIGHT?

709
00:32:02,866 --> 00:32:04,365
MM-HMM.

710
00:32:04,433 --> 00:32:06,966
OH, SO DO I,
AND NOBODY EVER TELLS ME THAT.

711
00:32:07,033 --> 00:32:09,399
WHENEVER ANYBODY
WANTS TO SCORE POINTS WITH ME,

712
00:32:09,467 --> 00:32:10,999
THEY TELL ME I'M PRETTY.

713
00:32:11,067 --> 00:32:13,432
AND I GET SO TIRED
OF THAT WHEN --

714
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:16,732
WHEN ACTUALLY,
I-I'VE DONE S-SOME VERY...

715
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,699
INTELLIGENT...

716
00:32:18,766 --> 00:32:20,999
THOUGHTFUL WORK.

00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:32,232
EVERYTHING'S
GONNA BE ALL RIGHT.

719
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:34,665
OH, NOW GET OFF THE ROAD,
LITTLE PUPPY,

720
00:32:34,733 --> 00:32:36,165
AND LET US BIG DOGS ROLL.

727
00:32:47,166 --> 00:32:48,632
THE BOYS ARE FROM TEXAS.

728
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:50,032
NO. HELLO.

729
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:52,466
IT'S A PLEASURE, MA'AM,
AND IF I'M NOT TOO BOLD,

730
00:32:52,533 --> 00:32:55,832
I'D JUST LIKE TO SAY THAT YOUR
HAIR'S PRETTY AS CORN SILK.

731
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:57,966
PRETTIER.
[ LAUGHS ]

732
00:32:58,033 --> 00:32:59,365
SAY, NOW, HENRY,

733
00:32:59,433 --> 00:33:01,966
WHATEVER IT IS YOU'RE ON TO,
I'LL TAKE A FOURTH OF IT.

734
00:33:02,033 --> 00:33:03,299
AND I'LL TAKE
AN EIGHTH.

735
00:33:03,366 --> 00:33:06,132
I'LL SEE YOUR EIGHTH
AND I'LL RAISE YOU A FOURTH.

736
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,865
WELL, UH,
I'LL TELL YOU, BOYS,

737
00:33:07,933 --> 00:33:09,799
I HAVEN'T GOT ANYTHING
GOING JUST NOW.

738
00:33:09,866 --> 00:33:12,466
THESE GENTLEMEN HAVE BEEN
ASSOCIATED WITH ME

739
00:33:12,533 --> 00:33:14,132
IN A COUPLE
OF MY VENTURES.

740
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,332
OH, COME ON, NOW, HENRY.
YOU CAN TELL US.

741
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,165
NOW, WHAT ARE WE
GETTING INTO THIS TIME?

742
00:33:18,233 --> 00:33:20,832
HONEST, BOYS, I'M JUST OUT
FOR A NICE SOCIABLE DINNER.

743
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:22,165
IS THAT TRUE, MA'AM?

744
00:33:22,233 --> 00:33:23,365
YES, THAT'S TRUE.

745
00:33:23,433 --> 00:33:26,032
WHERE CAN A MAN GET A BOWL
OF CHILI IN HERE?

746
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:27,966
HOW IS THE CHOW, MA'AM?

747
00:33:28,033 --> 00:33:30,066
WELL, IT'S JUST ABOUT
THE BEST IN THE WORLD --

748
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:32,066
WHEN YOU GET A CHANCE
TO ENJOY IT.

749
00:33:32,133 --> 00:33:34,365
YOU, UH, REALLY LIKE
THIS PLACE, HUH?

750
00:33:34,433 --> 00:33:37,132
UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES,
IT CAN BE HEAVEN.

751
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:40,865
WELL, PEOPLE HAVE
A DIFFERENT IDEA ABOUT HEAVEN.

752
00:33:40,933 --> 00:33:42,566
WELL, LET'S SEE.

753
00:33:42,633 --> 00:33:46,199
THERE'S A FEW INTERESTING PRINCIPLES.

754
00:33:46,266 --> 00:33:48,732
I MEAN, IT'S GOT
A HIGH MARGIN.

755
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,199
YOU KEEP THE PEOPLE
PACKED IN THERE.

756
00:33:50,266 --> 00:33:52,199
AT A DOLLAR AND A HALF A SHOT,
THEY'RE CRYING TO GET IN.

757
00:33:52,266 --> 00:33:54,632
BY THE TIME THEY HAVE
FOUR OR FIVE WHISKEYS,

758
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:57,232
THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THE WINE
TASTES LIKE ANYWAY.

759
00:33:57,300 --> 00:34:01,066
OH, YEAH, THEY GOT THEM
LITTLE PULLEY CARTS.

760
00:34:01,133 --> 00:34:03,532
FIRE INSURANCE.

761
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:07,032
YOU, UH, REALLY, <i>REALLY</i>
LIKE IT HERE?

762
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:08,599
YES.

763
00:34:14,366 --> 00:34:17,499
WELL, WHEN HE'S NOT BUSY,
WOULD YOU HAVE HIM CALL ME BACK?

764
00:34:17,567 --> 00:34:19,299
Bear: Miss Thatcher?

765
00:34:19,366 --> 00:34:20,732
YES, MR. BEAR?

766
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,199
What's new
with that widget thing

767
00:34:22,266 --> 00:34:23,532
we gave you
several days ago?

SHE'S MY NUMBER-ONE BOY.

1835

IN GREAT EASTERN

1839

OFF THE HOOK WITH GREAT EASTERN.

MY WHOLE POSITION?

1842

FOR HENRY AND MOLLY,
WE'LL TAKE THE WHOLE THING.

1843

WHAT TO SAY.

EXCEPT YOU MAKE ME FEEL HUMBLE.

1845
01:22:16,100 --> 01:22:17,599
TRULY HUMBLE.

1846
01:22:19,333 --> 01:22:21,732
OUT SHE GOES.

1847
01:22:21,800 --> 01:22:24,632
OH, HENRY, IF YOU KNEW HOW MUCH
I WANTED TO BE PRESIDENT.

1848
01:22:24,700 --> 01:22:26,032
WELL, THAT'S VERY NICE,

1849

OH, THAT.

1857
01:22:43,067 --> 01:22:45,932
UM, WELL, HENRY,
I KNOW I MADE THAT DEAL,

1858
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,099
BUT, WELL, MY TERM OF OFFICE
IS SIX MONTHS,

1859
01:22:48,167 --> 01:22:49,332
AND I JUST CAN'T LEAVE NOW.

1860
01:22:49,400 --> 01:22:51,332
You can wait six months,
can't you?

1861
01:22:51,400 --> 01:22:54,399
YOU MADE A PROMISE, MOLLY.
YOU GAVE ME YOUR WORD ON IT.

1862
01:22:54,466 --> 01:22:57,632
Please, Henry, how did I ever
know I'd really be president?

1863
01:22:57,700 --> 01:22:59,566
A PROMISE IS A PROMISE.

1864
01:22:59,633 --> 01:23:02,432
WELL, I KNOW I PROMISED,
BUT...

TALK IT OVER TONIGHT?

1866

WELL, UH, COULD YOU
DROP UP HERE, MOLLY?

IF YOU'D LIKE ME TO, HENRY.

1868
01:23:12,500 --> 01:23:15,566
I COULD ORDER US A LITTLE,
UH, LATE SUPPER.

A LITTLE ENTHUSIASTIC.

WELL, THEY'RE A PRETTY SLIPPERY

AND YOU CONSIDER THAT
PERFECTLY ETHICAL?

2169

AND I WANTED TO KEEP MY JOB.

TO DO WITH THE CHARGES.

UPON THE CREDIBILITY
OF THE WITNESSES.

THAT THEIR TESTIMONY
IS UNRELIABLE.
