1
00:02:12,937 --> 00:02:15,511
Is he conscious yet?
- No.

2
00:02:16,964 --> 00:02:18,857
Want to see him?

3
00:02:31,041 --> 00:02:32,661
Will he live?

4
00:02:33,657 --> 00:02:36,802
All I can say is that
he survived the operation.

5
00:02:40,848 --> 00:02:43,801
You shouldn't have bothered.
I'd have called for you.

6
00:02:45,057 --> 00:02:46,365
Is he dead?

7
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:48,723
No, but he's still unconscious.

8
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:52,378
It has been three days already...

9
00:02:52,378 --> 00:02:54,278
I wonder if it's worth the trouble
to intervene.

10
00:02:55,551 --> 00:02:57,638
If he could be moved...

11
00:02:58,375 --> 00:03:01,457
...we could start the experiment now.

12
00:03:02,057 --> 00:03:03,257
We'll think about it.

13
00:03:04,099 --> 00:03:06,227
Any dying person can be
maintained like that.

14
00:03:06,427 --> 00:03:08,149
Who knows?
- We do.

15
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:10,424
The experience would kill him.

16
00:03:11,152 --> 00:03:12,821
We need a healthy man.

17
00:03:17,219 --> 00:03:18,728
There he is.

18
00:03:22,291 --> 00:03:24,217
Will you talk to him now?

19
00:03:25,148 --> 00:03:27,363
I'd rather wait.

20
00:03:28,423 --> 00:03:31,153
Has he seen anyone?
- He doesn't want to see anyone.

21
00:03:32,339 --> 00:03:35,516
Why don't you want to do the experiment
with one of your men?

22
00:03:36,537 --> 00:03:40,383
You do have volunteers, didn't you?
- Many, but they weren't suitable.

23
00:03:40,525 --> 00:03:42,291
But why him?

24
00:03:42,836 --> 00:03:45,455
He has nothing to lose.
That's what we're looking for.

25
00:03:45,468 --> 00:03:49,996
Why not pick a convict?
Offer him a pardon.

26
00:03:50,541 --> 00:03:52,179
That is not an option.

27
00:03:56,705 --> 00:04:00,301
Does he have any chance
of returning?

28
00:04:01,777 --> 00:04:02,966
It's impossible to predict.

29
00:04:03,966 --> 00:04:06,166
This is the first time it's
being done with a man.

30
00:04:08,037 --> 00:04:09,642
I'd like to meet him.

31
00:04:10,413 --> 00:04:13,334
I'll call him for you.
Wait a minute.

32
00:04:18,406 --> 00:04:20,492
You left your things
back in your room.

33
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:23,254
Thanks. I won't need them.

34
00:04:38,373 --> 00:04:40,332
Claude Ridder?

35
00:04:41,832 --> 00:04:42,832
Yes, that's me.

36
00:04:43,018 --> 00:04:45,509
Do you have a moment,
or rather, a day?

37
00:04:48,347 --> 00:04:52,700
No, we're not the police.
I'm from Crespel Research Centre.

38
00:04:53,972 --> 00:04:55,910
Crespel? Never heard of it.

39
00:04:56,076 --> 00:04:58,077
Nobody has.

40
00:04:58,277 --> 00:05:02,077
 If you have no other plans for today,
I'd like to take you there.

41
00:05:02,946 --> 00:05:04,580
Is it far?

42
00:05:04,654 --> 00:05:06,681
Some 50 km.
We have a car.

43
00:05:07,929 --> 00:05:10,530
How's the weather?
Sunny.

44
00:05:11,428 --> 00:05:13,098
Then why not.

45
00:05:13,698 --> 00:05:14,898
- The taxi.
- I'll take care of it.

46
00:05:21,701 --> 00:05:24,815
Want to go by your house?
- No thanks.

47
00:05:30,819 --> 00:05:33,129
Am I the man you want?

48
00:05:33,529 --> 00:05:34,477
Without a doubt.

49
00:05:34,678 --> 00:05:37,278
This isn't a kidnapping.

50
00:05:37,848 --> 00:05:39,903
It wouldn't go well for you.
I have no family.

51
00:05:47,297 --> 00:05:50,283
What's Crespel like?

52
00:05:51,054 --> 00:05:54,071
It's a place that doesn't exist yet.

53
00:05:55,033 --> 00:05:58,018
Is it pretty?
Not particularly.

54
00:06:07,746 --> 00:06:09,288
Are you tired?

55
00:06:09,801 --> 00:06:11,567
I've been asked the same thing
every hour for three weeks.

56
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:13,780
Have you recovered well?

57
00:06:14,167 --> 00:06:15,931
Why so much interest in me?

58
00:06:24,343 --> 00:06:26,129
Can you smoke?

59
00:06:26,429 --> 00:06:28,855
Yes, I'm better now.

60
00:06:29,456 --> 00:06:32,229
Apart from cancer, I have
nothing to worry about.

61
00:06:33,299 --> 00:06:35,546
Glad you were saved?

62
00:06:36,221 --> 00:06:37,890
I'm not sure I was saved.

63
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:58,242
We're nearly there.

64
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:02,674
You don't seem too worried.
- It's all the same to me.

65
00:07:02,858 --> 00:07:04,655
What else would you like
to happen to me?

66
00:07:05,498 --> 00:07:07,166
What if it's something extraordinary?

67
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:09,995
Really, as in fairy tales?

68
00:07:56,373 --> 00:07:58,298
You were right.
It isn't very pretty.

69
00:07:58,909 --> 00:08:00,449
But not without interest.

70
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:03,242
This is Crespel?
- Yes, here.

71
00:08:04,542 --> 00:08:05,942
I thought it was a town.

72
00:08:06,085 --> 00:08:09,477
There is one 5 km away,
but it's not Crespel.

73
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:12,680
The boss will see you straight away.

74
00:08:50,111 --> 00:08:52,808
Surprised?
Frankly, yes.

75
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:56,151
The Centre has existed for 15 years.

76
00:08:56,251 --> 00:08:59,251
Around here it's assumed
we study agriculture.

77
00:08:59,324 --> 00:09:02,399
But the subject of agriculture
is unknown to us.

78
00:09:02,599 --> 00:09:05,099
Our object of study is time.

79
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:08,570
Have you figured it out?
- Partially.

80
00:09:08,891 --> 00:09:11,331
Where do I come in?

81
00:09:12,455 --> 00:09:18,036
I have a question for you, Mr. Ridder,
if you'd like to answer it.

82
00:09:18,236 --> 00:09:19,536
All right.

83
00:09:19,902 --> 00:09:22,792
I suppose you had a reason
to have attempted suicide...

84
00:09:23,692 --> 00:09:24,792
Yes...

85
00:09:24,968 --> 00:09:26,676
Have you changed your mind?

86
00:09:26,876 --> 00:09:28,476
It may be necessary to ask this
question again.

87
00:09:29,176 --> 00:09:31,676
- Who for?
- For you.

88
00:09:32,936 --> 00:09:36,081
No, it hasn't changed.

89
00:09:36,691 --> 00:09:38,521
You'd do it again?

90
00:09:41,186 --> 00:09:43,498
I am the perfect guinea pig, right?

91
00:09:44,332 --> 00:09:46,643
A volunteer who does not cling to life?

92
00:09:48,346 --> 00:09:51,554
If I accept, what chance
do I have of surviving?

93
00:09:53,578 --> 00:09:55,374
100% if you were a mouse.

94
00:09:57,589 --> 00:09:59,420
Let me show you something.

95
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,337
The passage of time, no doubt.

96
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:05,437
I need to think about it.

97
00:10:06,803 --> 00:10:09,821
I found interesting your idea
of a municipal agency...

98
00:10:10,366 --> 00:10:12,966
...to distribute time around
the city as it sees fit.

99
00:10:13,802 --> 00:10:16,081
It wouldn't work.
- Time would break down.

100
00:10:16,623 --> 00:10:19,126
I always thought we should
have a team of novelists...

101
00:10:19,933 --> 00:10:23,303
paid to put their wild ideas on paper.

102
00:10:27,389 --> 00:10:28,995
In this jar is mouse A;
in the other, mouse B.

103
00:10:30,086 --> 00:10:33,007
Look at them.
Do you see any difference?

104
00:10:33,874 --> 00:10:35,640
I don't know. Is one a female
and the other male?

105
00:10:36,314 --> 00:10:38,753
No, both are males.
But mouse B is a pioneer.

106
00:10:39,523 --> 00:10:41,385
A has never left his jar.

107
00:10:42,059 --> 00:10:45,046
B travelled in time and went back to
live for one minute in his past.

108
00:10:45,719 --> 00:10:47,453
A hero. When did this happen?

109
00:10:48,288 --> 00:10:50,181
Yesterday. With no ill effects.

110
00:10:50,631 --> 00:10:54,001
How do you be sure
that he travelled in time?

111
00:10:55,607 --> 00:10:57,436
That's the problem.

112
00:10:57,758 --> 00:11:00,455
We're confident it happened,
but he can't tell us.

113
00:11:00,961 --> 00:11:02,643
The technicians thought of everything.

114
00:11:02,743 --> 00:11:07,143
They should have taught him to speak
before doing the experiment.

115
00:11:08,127 --> 00:11:10,598
You'll go back exactly one year
into your past.

116
00:11:11,914 --> 00:11:15,511
And the experience won't last any more
than one minute.

117
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:19,041
What if it kills me?

118
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:24,789
With the treatment we've devised,
that won't happen.

119
00:11:26,873 --> 00:11:28,672
Where were you
this time last year?

120
00:11:32,653 --> 00:11:34,385
On holiday.

121
00:11:36,569 --> 00:11:41,416
I had 3 months off last year.
I was in France, on the Riviera.

122
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:43,728
Are you sure?

123
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,439
My memories are organised
around my holidays.

124
00:11:47,043 --> 00:11:49,423
You'll be in a  sort of sphere.

125
00:11:50,098 --> 00:11:53,628
When you return you must wait
four minutes to recover.

126
00:11:54,303 --> 00:11:55,939
Four minutes? Why?

127
00:11:56,339 --> 00:11:58,039
I'll explain.

128
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:02,429
In a way,
we could compare it...

129
00:12:02,563 --> 00:12:07,332
...to the decompression chamber
that divers use.

130
00:12:09,615 --> 00:12:12,536
Are you interested?
- Not much.

131
00:12:14,045 --> 00:12:18,057
Why the past instead of the future?
Wouldn't it be more interesting?

132
00:12:18,533 --> 00:12:20,435
I agree with you.

133
00:12:20,635 --> 00:12:24,600
The result may not seem
very spectacular

134
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:28,000
But  for the moment
we can't go further.

135
00:12:29,422 --> 00:12:31,572
So we've started with
only small steps.

136
00:12:31,772 --> 00:12:33,572
An experience that
barely seems interesting.

137
00:12:35,553 --> 00:12:38,121
No heart problems?
Nothing, not even a small ulcer?

138
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:40,593
You're quite healthy.

139
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:43,997
You see, suicide is
good for your health.

140
00:12:44,735 --> 00:12:47,656
You'll have to stay here
for a few days.

141
00:12:48,265 --> 00:12:49,935
On some kind of diet?

142
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:54,493
Sort of.
Only for four days.

143
00:12:56,581 --> 00:13:00,690
Will I have to sign a release
before the experiment?

144
00:13:01,782 --> 00:13:03,546
I suppose so.

145
00:13:05,281 --> 00:13:08,233
If something goes wrong,
you could say I died in hospital.

146
00:13:09,003 --> 00:13:10,545
Absolutely.

147
00:13:10,618 --> 00:13:11,992
Good thinking.

148
00:13:13,594 --> 00:13:15,920
Was it your first suicide?
- Yes.

149
00:13:17,993 --> 00:13:19,437
With a gun?
- Yes.

150
00:13:22,199 --> 00:13:24,316
I can't imagine you with a gun.
- Neither can I.

151
00:13:25,055 --> 00:13:27,014
That's why I failed.

152
00:13:29,324 --> 00:13:31,507
Are you afraid?
- No.

153
00:13:32,214 --> 00:13:35,938
I've been afraid all my life...

154
00:13:36,484 --> 00:13:38,281
But not anymore.

155
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,732
Do you sleep well?
- Very well.

156
00:13:40,832 --> 00:13:43,232
No headaches?
- No.

157
00:13:44,229 --> 00:13:47,492
We'll see tomorrow.
I have to observe the effects of T. 5.

158
00:13:47,729 --> 00:13:49,770
Doesn't seem to hurt you.

159
00:13:50,777 --> 00:13:53,013
Now we just have to wait.
- Three more days.

160
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:55,809
What will happen to me
if I stay for years?

161
00:13:56,376 --> 00:14:00,329
It will only last 60 seconds.
We know because of the mice.

162
00:14:51,089 --> 00:14:53,989
Can I go in?
I won't wake up among pirates?

163
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:02,238
You'll lie down.
We'll close the door.

164
00:15:03,362 --> 00:15:08,178
You'll go back one year,
then come back here a minute later.

165
00:15:10,111 --> 00:15:11,909
Disappointed?

166
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:13,873
A bit.

167
00:15:16,173 --> 00:15:19,773
I expected a kind of... laboratory.

168
00:15:20,673 --> 00:15:22,773
Something electric.

169
00:15:24,878 --> 00:15:27,671
What if, for example... it fails?

170
00:15:28,345 --> 00:15:29,719
Impossible.

171
00:15:30,219 --> 00:15:34,219
You'll go back to September 5, 1966
at precisely 4 p.m.

172
00:15:34,893 --> 00:15:37,333
Why 4 p.m.?

173
00:15:38,328 --> 00:15:41,796
It's the time we chose.
We always sent the mice at that time...

174
00:15:42,033 --> 00:15:44,139
And they always came back.
- It became a habit.

175
00:15:44,846 --> 00:15:46,771
I never thought that scientists
would be superstitious!

176
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:50,527
Why was I chosen, I wonder?

177
00:15:51,201 --> 00:15:53,064
Let's say our computer chose you.

178
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:55,359
Out of millions, of course.
- Sure.

179
00:15:55,559 --> 00:15:57,459
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

180
00:15:58,168 --> 00:15:59,548
There's nothing to worry about.

181
00:16:00,121 --> 00:16:04,182
As we increase the dose
of T.5., you'll sleep more and more.

182
00:16:05,038 --> 00:16:07,091
I talk in my sleep.

183
00:16:07,638 --> 00:16:10,815
That is also an effect of T.5.
And when you wake up?

184
00:16:11,523 --> 00:16:13,192
I feel all right.

185
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:16,627
Tomorrow, one hour before
entering the sphere ...

186
00:16:16,732 --> 00:16:19,804
we will inject you with
a large dose of T.5.

187
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,216
You'll be drugged but
perfectly lucid.

188
00:16:24,516 --> 00:16:25,920
Don't worry.

189
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,720
The treatment has prepared you
for this stage.

190
00:16:28,921 --> 00:16:30,912
Will I be able to move?

191
00:16:31,586 --> 00:16:34,468
The experiment requires that the subject
be completely passive.

192
00:16:34,668 --> 00:16:36,468
But you will be able to remember.

193
00:16:36,594 --> 00:16:38,568
Asleep but awake.

194
00:19:32,168 --> 00:19:33,368
Is it good?

195
00:19:36,037 --> 00:19:37,823
Coming?
- Later

196
00:19:40,614 --> 00:19:44,434
Two sea snakes and
a few sharks.

197
00:19:44,969 --> 00:19:47,280
That's about all.

198
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,580
- Is it good?
- Very good.

199
00:20:05,594 --> 00:20:06,954
Did you see many fish?

200
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:10,933
Two sea snakes and
a few sharks.

201
00:20:11,702 --> 00:20:13,949
That's about all.

202
00:20:18,027 --> 00:20:20,723
I don't like that apparatus.

203
00:20:21,045 --> 00:20:23,324
You always say that.

204
00:20:35,523 --> 00:20:37,193
Was it good?
- Yes.

205
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:38,862
Did you see many fish?

206
00:20:45,571 --> 00:20:46,752
Let's go out for dinner.

207
00:20:47,552 --> 00:20:48,752
If you want to.

208
00:20:50,419 --> 00:20:53,212
Coming?
Later.

209
00:21:14,462 --> 00:21:16,806
It couldn't end any other way.

210
00:21:30,384 --> 00:21:32,087
About 4 months.

211
00:21:32,825 --> 00:21:35,778
How long will dedicate
yourself to packing?

212
00:21:36,453 --> 00:21:38,410
As long as there are
things to send.

213
00:21:38,582 --> 00:21:41,270
It seems you've developed
a good reputation in packing..

214
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:44,970
I believe we could use
that energy better in something else.

215
00:21:45,794 --> 00:21:49,646
You could manage a line,
hold a responsible position.

216
00:21:50,385 --> 00:21:52,182
I hate responsibility.

217
00:21:52,857 --> 00:21:55,306
I felt the same at your age.

218
00:21:55,506 --> 00:21:57,706
C'mon, let's have a coffee.

219
00:21:58,410 --> 00:22:00,722
Rich family?
- Pretty well off, yes.

220
00:22:01,299 --> 00:22:02,809
At your age I had debts.

221
00:22:10,309 --> 00:22:12,509
- Is it good?
- Very good.

222
00:22:13,523 --> 00:22:14,976
See many fish?

223
00:22:15,714 --> 00:22:18,571
Two sea snakes and
a few sharks.

224
00:22:36,419 --> 00:22:38,045
We've lost him.

225
00:22:43,567 --> 00:22:45,188
Every time, the same thing.

226
00:22:52,912 --> 00:22:56,057
What time did she come?
- At nine.

227
00:22:57,567 --> 00:23:00,295
If we want to send out those 5,000 circulars
by this afternoon, everyone will have to work.

228
00:23:00,936 --> 00:23:03,568
Imagine, she hasn't even
done 100 yet!

229
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:07,357
In four hours?

230
00:23:08,192 --> 00:23:11,434
One envelope for each 2 minutes.
Quite a performance.

231
00:23:12,332 --> 00:23:15,383
It's a record.
Is she pretty?

232
00:23:15,883 --> 00:23:17,083
Who?

233
00:23:17,437 --> 00:23:19,235
The record-breaker.

234
00:23:20,326 --> 00:23:22,124
In a way.
- In a way?

235
00:23:22,862 --> 00:23:24,693
Send her in.

236
00:23:35,993 --> 00:23:37,493
Left.

237
00:23:37,853 --> 00:23:40,321
See, even your car is a problem.

238
00:23:41,138 --> 00:23:43,256
Shall we stop
for lunch in an hour?

239
00:23:43,962 --> 00:23:45,663
If you like.

240
00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:48,814
I don't know.

241
00:23:49,314 --> 00:23:52,214
Something about Catherine bothers me.

242
00:23:52,405 --> 00:23:55,493
Perhaps the fact that
you don't unsettle her?

243
00:23:55,693 --> 00:23:59,209
You're a quiet sort aren't you?
- When I have nothing to say, yes.

244
00:23:59,449 --> 00:24:01,790
What did you do when you met her?
- Nothing.

245
00:24:01,810 --> 00:24:04,539
And now?
- Not much.

246
00:24:05,082 --> 00:24:07,140
Not much.
Let's stop here to eat.

247
00:24:29,964 --> 00:24:32,725
The effect of the T. 5. is weak anyway.

248
00:24:33,239 --> 00:24:35,261
Seven minutes.
- He's come back 5 times already.

249
00:24:38,759 --> 00:24:41,104
The transition period
always scares me.

250
00:24:41,509 --> 00:24:43,861
Why not get him out before the
four minutes are up?

251
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:46,628
Because he could stay
like that for weeks.

252
00:24:46,881 --> 00:24:49,611
We'll wait.
- If we wait he'll starve.

253
00:24:50,285 --> 00:24:53,206
It's odd to see it all
from a heated train.

254
00:24:53,881 --> 00:24:55,999
Was it cold?
Very cold.

255
00:24:56,930 --> 00:24:59,762
In a few minutes we'll pass
a town I liberated.

256
00:24:59,962 --> 00:25:02,062
Were you alone?
- Almost.

257
00:25:02,185 --> 00:25:04,400
We were about 50...

258
00:25:04,666 --> 00:25:06,528
...against many Germans.

259
00:25:07,234 --> 00:25:09,578
Guns don't suit you.

260
00:25:10,253 --> 00:25:11,986
I never got used to them.

261
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:25,983
There might be a street
with your name on it.

262
00:25:26,592 --> 00:25:28,936
It wasn't so amusing back then.

263
00:25:29,723 --> 00:25:32,697
Why didn't you come on Wednesday?
- I forgot.

264
00:25:33,558 --> 00:25:36,608
Come tonight,
both of you.

265
00:25:36,878 --> 00:25:38,484
Which two?
- You and Catherine.

266
00:25:39,755 --> 00:25:41,361
It'll be difficult.
We've separated.

267
00:25:41,561 --> 00:25:44,861
How long were you together for?
- Seven years.

268
00:25:44,907 --> 00:25:46,828
Come alone if you like, then.

269
00:25:48,294 --> 00:25:50,701
Aren't you afraid of having
that dirty wall behind you?

270
00:25:51,503 --> 00:25:53,848
The papers on the table
scare me more.

271
00:25:59,143 --> 00:26:04,312
We should redecorate your office.
Paintings and tapestries.

272
00:26:05,314 --> 00:26:08,364
In your office, for example,
a big picture...

273
00:26:09,208 --> 00:26:13,763
...of an unpaid bill
dated February 17, 1951.

274
00:26:14,746 --> 00:26:17,475
The bookkeeper removed a
heap of commas.

275
00:26:17,747 --> 00:26:20,170
He is struggling against effectiveness.

276
00:26:26,914 --> 00:26:28,325
An eraser...

277
00:26:28,999 --> 00:26:30,540
...and no pencil?

278
00:26:30,737 --> 00:26:32,216
I hate pencils.

279
00:26:32,316 --> 00:26:33,516
And the rubbers?
- No.

280
00:26:33,616 --> 00:26:35,216
Because they are useless
without a pencil.

281
00:26:35,216 --> 00:26:37,216
Hello
- Hello

282
00:26:37,677 --> 00:26:41,336
Compliments of the author...
Compliments of the author...

283
00:26:42,075 --> 00:26:44,258
You don't have much imagination.

284
00:26:44,836 --> 00:26:46,820
I don't know her.
I don't know what to say.

285
00:27:11,050 --> 00:27:15,288
A swimmer got drowned.

286
00:27:15,962 --> 00:27:17,342
Is he dead?
- For a good while.

287
00:27:19,428 --> 00:27:20,937
He was a good swimmer.

288
00:27:21,915 --> 00:27:25,382
He must have swum for hours
before he drowned.

289
00:27:26,182 --> 00:27:29,882
For hours, you realize?
- Claude.

290
00:27:30,791 --> 00:27:32,365
Be quiet.

291
00:27:32,706 --> 00:27:34,278
You do not need me.

292
00:27:34,313 --> 00:27:36,050
You only need what is right here.

293
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:38,150
You could have me embalmed
and put in a corner.

294
00:27:38,221 --> 00:27:41,186
But I'm alive, I move,
come, go, see people.

295
00:27:41,192 --> 00:27:43,375
If I didn't,
I'd kill myself.

296
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:46,497
The more I give you,
the worse you get.

297
00:27:59,323 --> 00:28:01,723
I don't think I understand you anymore.

298
00:28:02,423 --> 00:28:03,723
I'm leaving.

299
00:28:10,052 --> 00:28:11,650
Tomorrow, I am leaving.

300
00:28:28,419 --> 00:28:29,863
It's 3 p.m.

301
00:28:32,652 --> 00:28:34,514
However, there are still
3 hours to go.

302
00:28:36,537 --> 00:28:38,817
3 minutes ago it was 3 p. m.

303
00:28:40,998 --> 00:28:43,567
In 3 weeks it will be 3 p. m.

304
00:28:45,365 --> 00:28:46,841
In a century too.

305
00:28:47,933 --> 00:28:50,333
Time passes for everybody
but for me...

306
00:28:50,537 --> 00:28:52,831
...stuck in this room...

307
00:28:53,131 --> 00:28:54,831
...It doesn't pass.

308
00:28:57,146 --> 00:28:58,977
Search for your time.

309
00:29:00,324 --> 00:29:02,283
It's 3 p. m. forever.

310
00:29:04,483 --> 00:29:05,683
Hello?

311
00:29:13,014 --> 00:29:14,462
Hello...

312
00:29:15,994 --> 00:29:18,370
On the third beep it will be exactly...

313
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:22,170
Exactly three o'clock,
zero minutes, zero seconds.

314
00:29:22,251 --> 00:29:24,400
Pardon? All right...

315
00:29:25,139 --> 00:29:27,226
...tomorrow at the same time,
as we agreed.

316
00:29:28,445 --> 00:29:30,179
Love to the family.

317
00:29:36,383 --> 00:29:38,406
For 100 million years...

318
00:29:38,445 --> 00:29:40,600
...the Earth belonged to
algae and molluscs...

319
00:29:40,934 --> 00:29:43,109
...and then reptiles ruled the earth...

320
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,756
...until this company I'm
working for was created.

321
00:29:47,836 --> 00:29:52,624
I believe that I'm travelling from
birth to death at 100,000 kph

322
00:29:53,365 --> 00:29:57,853
The earth will spin for
millions of years more without me...

323
00:29:58,658 --> 00:30:03,071
And  as a result,
I'm here, using a pencil...

324
00:30:03,414 --> 00:30:07,629
...to express our sincere
regrets to a customer...

325
00:30:07,829 --> 00:30:10,229
...for the loss of his shipment sent
on the fourth...

326
00:30:13,036 --> 00:30:15,476
and to tell him that we'll do
all we can to...

327
00:30:15,576 --> 00:30:16,776
Ready?

328
00:30:17,976 --> 00:30:18,676
Yes.

329
00:30:21,159 --> 00:30:23,113
What?
What's a mouse doing here?

330
00:30:23,847 --> 00:30:26,102
Did you say something?
- No.

331
00:30:27,322 --> 00:30:29,770
I just saw a mouse.
- So?

332
00:30:30,178 --> 00:30:33,206
Have you ever seen
a mouse on a beach!

333
00:30:33,549 --> 00:30:35,122
Maybe it's on vacation.

334
00:30:39,522 --> 00:30:41,022
How was it?

335
00:30:43,211 --> 00:30:45,009
In a sense it was successful.

336
00:30:45,426 --> 00:30:47,546
He isn't dead.
On the other hand...

337
00:30:49,027 --> 00:30:50,304
A time race.

338
00:30:50,504 --> 00:30:53,004
Office time against outside time.

339
00:30:53,006 --> 00:30:55,991
Who's winning?
Don't know yet.

340
00:30:56,667 --> 00:31:00,044
She's pretty, yes,
looks like your kind.

341
00:31:00,315 --> 00:31:03,718
Beautiful, clean, modest...

342
00:31:03,792 --> 00:31:07,011
Things that I despise.
- You like me because you hate almost everything.

343
00:31:07,452 --> 00:31:10,245
I like things that are changeable.

344
00:31:10,855 --> 00:31:12,878
Am I changeable?

345
00:31:13,808 --> 00:31:14,652
Not really.

346
00:31:15,552 --> 00:31:16,752
Not absolutely.

347
00:31:18,495 --> 00:31:23,282
Rather, you are ... surprising.
A swamp.

348
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:25,572
A dark night...

349
00:31:26,777 --> 00:31:30,181
One would rather wring your neck
than smile at you...

350
00:31:31,368 --> 00:31:33,689
...or slowly melt into you...

351
00:31:33,889 --> 00:31:35,089
..and sink.

352
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:39,729
I can't imagine Monique
outside your window.

353
00:31:39,973 --> 00:31:42,323
You reek of low tide...

354
00:31:43,023 --> 00:31:45,323
drownings, octopus.

355
00:31:47,654 --> 00:31:50,886
Behind, this beach.
- This beach is me...

356
00:31:51,239 --> 00:31:53,198
I need you.

357
00:31:54,417 --> 00:31:57,661
I have needed you since
in the office they told me...

358
00:31:58,334 --> 00:32:01,417
...of a girl who hated envelopes.

359
00:32:02,379 --> 00:32:04,177
...and work.

360
00:32:06,456 --> 00:32:09,571
Let's make love.

361
00:32:11,528 --> 00:32:13,166
Here, on the sand?

362
00:32:17,659 --> 00:32:20,839
I'd run away to a land
without nights...

363
00:32:24,073 --> 00:32:26,784
You know what?
Your wife has a nice behind.

364
00:32:27,675 --> 00:32:30,855
I'll tell you what you see
right now.

365
00:32:31,688 --> 00:32:34,128
You're by a window, no?
Let me see...

366
00:32:34,834 --> 00:32:37,692
Everything is blue...

367
00:32:38,463 --> 00:32:41,319
...the sea, the sand,
the town...

368
00:32:41,961 --> 00:32:43,953
Even the people are blue...

369
00:32:44,262 --> 00:32:46,721
And the many beautiful girls
that caught your attention...

370
00:32:47,194 --> 00:32:49,441
I miss you Claude...

371
00:32:50,564 --> 00:32:54,161
It both bothers me,
knowing that I miss you.

372
00:32:54,762 --> 00:32:56,125
It's the first time...

373
00:32:57,449 --> 00:32:59,093
I was always unaffected.

374
00:32:59,293 --> 00:33:02,393
I was always indifferent to the
presence or absence of things

375
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:06,102
Perhaps there's a white sail
in the distance.

376
00:33:06,177 --> 00:33:09,256
I also see some seagulls
spiralling down to the beach.

377
00:33:09,602 --> 00:33:11,688
Are there any on the Costa Azul?

378
00:33:12,234 --> 00:33:14,674
They bring rain...

379
00:33:14,994 --> 00:33:16,632
It never rains there.

380
00:33:19,257 --> 00:33:22,606
We're wasting time, Ridder.
We'll never finish the circulars tonight.

381
00:33:23,181 --> 00:33:24,913
And you keep turning that crank.

382
00:33:28,690 --> 00:33:31,056
It's always beautiful.
- It's beautiful.

383
00:33:35,251 --> 00:33:37,563
Here nature doesn't have
that ugly green of the countryside.

384
00:33:39,938 --> 00:33:41,928
Coming?
Later.

385
00:33:47,063 --> 00:33:50,250
And if I'd been married?
- I do not know what would have done.

386
00:33:50,550 --> 00:33:52,250
I wouldn't have cared, surely.

387
00:33:53,446 --> 00:33:56,848
When I met you,
I felt nothing special.

388
00:33:57,755 --> 00:33:59,905
It was a matter of... your being different.

389
00:34:02,087 --> 00:34:06,839
You were really out of your
element at the office.

390
00:34:07,996 --> 00:34:10,017
I knew the rest
didn't matter.

391
00:34:10,339 --> 00:34:13,371
You could have been indifferent.
- No, not at all.

392
00:34:16,181 --> 00:34:21,165
I was so scared that night,
when we left the restaurant.

393
00:34:22,376 --> 00:34:25,620
Did you quit your job for no other
reason than to impress me?

394
00:34:26,229 --> 00:34:28,123
Yes. Were you impressed?

395
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:31,237
Were you making
good money?

396
00:34:31,558 --> 00:34:33,998
A living.

397
00:34:43,146 --> 00:34:45,105
Have I told you that
your eyes are beautiful?

398
00:34:49,086 --> 00:34:51,269
And I want you.
- Me too.

399
00:34:52,469 --> 00:34:54,469
See? We are not pioneers.

400
00:34:55,730 --> 00:34:57,497
Shall we answer?

401
00:34:59,487 --> 00:35:00,803
No.

402
00:35:11,515 --> 00:35:15,014
Catherine, I love you.

403
00:35:18,170 --> 00:35:19,935
Do you hear me?

404
00:35:21,819 --> 00:35:23,487
I love you.

405
00:35:26,156 --> 00:35:28,050
It was the only reason.

406
00:35:30,755 --> 00:35:34,576
Long before you died.

407
00:35:37,112 --> 00:35:38,748
And now I'm dead.

408
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:48,186
I'm cold.

409
00:35:49,933 --> 00:35:52,084
I hear my own words.

410
00:35:54,509 --> 00:35:56,179
It's the drug...

411
00:36:00,801 --> 00:36:03,049
What are my chances
of surviving?

412
00:36:04,402 --> 00:36:08,314
Ah, yes, 100% if I were a mouse.

413
00:36:10,978 --> 00:36:13,386
I am a mouse then,
if I'm alive.

414
00:36:15,602 --> 00:36:19,004
They'll come now.

415
00:36:19,357 --> 00:36:21,251
There's still four
minutes to wait.

416
00:36:26,163 --> 00:36:29,598
And the mouse?
Where's the mouse?

417
00:36:33,985 --> 00:36:35,943
You're delirious!

418
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,383
Unfortunately not.

419
00:36:42,884 --> 00:36:45,688
Claude, please stop.
You're scaring me.

420
00:36:45,831 --> 00:36:47,595
I don't mean to.

421
00:36:47,852 --> 00:36:50,437
I killed Catherine
two months ago in Glasgow.

422
00:36:52,429 --> 00:36:55,630
I went with her without telling anyone,
and I came back alone.

423
00:36:56,730 --> 00:36:57,730
I don't believe you.

424
00:36:57,804 --> 00:36:59,763
You're both right and wrong.

425
00:37:00,276 --> 00:37:01,785
What do you mean?

426
00:37:01,863 --> 00:37:04,185
You're right.
I'm not capable of killing.

427
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:07,418
But you're wrong,
because I did.

428
00:37:07,596 --> 00:37:09,200
Impossible.

429
00:37:09,907 --> 00:37:12,304
I thought so too.

430
00:37:13,323 --> 00:37:15,081
What can we do?

431
00:37:15,281 --> 00:37:20,081
We won't get out of here
until they do away with trams.

432
00:37:20,155 --> 00:37:23,589
Buses are just as bad.

433
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:28,950
Cars will be useless soon.

434
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:32,340
I'll give you some advice, sir.

435
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:35,977
I'd recommend that you hop out
and take the tram...

436
00:37:36,813 --> 00:37:38,609
...otherwise, you'll miss your train.

437
00:37:39,049 --> 00:37:40,897
Have you got time, sir?

438
00:37:41,566 --> 00:37:45,258
We'll have to cook
the cat's eyes.

439
00:37:48,437 --> 00:37:50,973
What?
- We have a cat, don't we.

440
00:37:53,606 --> 00:37:56,173
Are psychoses red?
- No. The future is red.

441
00:37:56,783 --> 00:37:58,164
And psychoses?

442
00:37:58,838 --> 00:38:00,411
I get them mixed up.

443
00:38:19,063 --> 00:38:20,732
Are you awake too?

444
00:38:21,774 --> 00:38:23,529
Go to the office for me.

445
00:38:29,402 --> 00:38:31,744
I need you.
- I'm hard to live with.

446
00:38:32,836 --> 00:38:34,506
I don't want
to live with you.

447
00:38:35,596 --> 00:38:37,299
I want to be with you.

448
00:38:39,159 --> 00:38:40,958
I want you to
stay with me tonight.

449
00:38:43,557 --> 00:38:45,548
Don't leave me.

450
00:38:48,212 --> 00:38:50,075
I'm afraid...
- Afraid?

451
00:38:50,116 --> 00:38:51,849
Yes, I'm afraid of
losing you.

452
00:38:51,949 --> 00:38:53,149
Of finding myself
alone tomorrow.

453
00:38:55,371 --> 00:38:57,170
Of being without you tonight.

454
00:38:59,319 --> 00:39:01,072
If you like, we could
spend the night in ...

455
00:39:29,848 --> 00:39:33,284
Last time he stayed in the sphere
for one minute 29.

456
00:39:34,184 --> 00:39:36,584
He arrived at 4 minutes 23.

457
00:39:37,939 --> 00:39:41,148
Now he's been gone for
3 minutes and 4 seconds...

458
00:39:53,269 --> 00:39:56,194
He's trapped in that minute,
reliving it endlessly.

459
00:39:56,205 --> 00:39:58,195
That's what gives us the best
chance of bringing him back.

460
00:39:58,806 --> 00:40:00,602
I couldn't stay there.

461
00:40:01,213 --> 00:40:03,395
Stay here if you like.
- No, I'm going home.

462
00:40:05,225 --> 00:40:06,670
Aren't you sleepy?

463
00:40:07,216 --> 00:40:08,886
She'd be sad
if you didn't come.

464
00:40:09,174 --> 00:40:13,154
Sad? She's always sad...

465
00:40:13,797 --> 00:40:16,847
...when I'm there...when I'm not...
...when she's asleep... when she's awake...

466
00:40:17,488 --> 00:40:20,378
Sometimes I think she's
sadness personified.

467
00:40:21,179 --> 00:40:23,587
You should be used to it,
after five years.

468
00:40:24,167 --> 00:40:27,954
I think of leaving her.

469
00:40:29,976 --> 00:40:32,064
I can't help her.
Nobody can help her.

470
00:40:32,834 --> 00:40:34,439
She needs you.

471
00:40:35,048 --> 00:40:36,687
That doesn't help.

472
00:40:38,804 --> 00:40:39,928
Could you leave her?

473
00:40:40,409 --> 00:40:42,047
Probably not.

474
00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:46,187
Sometimes I can't stand it.
I feel oxidized...

475
00:40:48,563 --> 00:40:50,444
Once I left...
- But you returned.

476
00:40:50,526 --> 00:40:51,835
Yes, after 2 days.

477
00:40:51,936 --> 00:40:55,244
She greeted me as if I'd been to the cinema
and asked if I had eaten well.

478
00:40:57,521 --> 00:40:59,317
Claude Ridder,
you've had it.

479
00:41:06,444 --> 00:41:09,418
At the time, she wanted
to have a house by the sea...

480
00:41:10,121 --> 00:41:11,950
...but was never sadder
than when we went to the Riviera.

481
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:14,150
Perhaps she doesn't
like the sun.

482
00:41:14,358 --> 00:41:18,178
She loves the sun, but she can't
help thinking that one day it won't exist.

483
00:41:19,173 --> 00:41:22,159
You can't live with her
or without her.

484
00:41:22,833 --> 00:41:27,778
And so God created the Earth, looked at it
and said: "I'm just waiting for it to turn".

485
00:41:31,917 --> 00:41:33,555
You go to sleep.

486
00:41:34,134 --> 00:41:35,803
I'm not sleepy.

487
00:41:55,995 --> 00:41:58,371
You're not good at that.

488
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:00,747
Not especially. I don't write anything.

489
00:42:01,934 --> 00:42:04,342
This job doesn't suit you.

490
00:42:05,111 --> 00:42:07,711
No job does.
Offices make me sick.

491
00:42:08,011 --> 00:42:10,111
They make you sick?
- Yes.

492
00:42:13,426 --> 00:42:15,995
Do you know what you've earned this morning?
- No.

493
00:42:16,284 --> 00:42:19,879
Exactly 14 francs.
Enough for a pack of cigarettes

494
00:42:20,384 --> 00:42:24,028
Not much, especially because
I won't be back after lunch.

495
00:42:25,445 --> 00:42:28,367
Did you expect to make money
in just one morning?

496
00:42:28,868 --> 00:42:30,760
For how long?

497
00:42:31,532 --> 00:42:34,018
I don't know.
A day... till tomorrow.

498
00:42:34,918 --> 00:42:36,118
Okay.

499
00:42:38,433 --> 00:42:40,552
Here's what we'll do...

500
00:42:43,870 --> 00:42:47,047
I'll give you the 14 francs I owe you...

501
00:42:50,643 --> 00:42:53,339
And you ask me to lunch
with that small fortune.

502
00:42:58,443 --> 00:43:00,659
Why?
- Because it doesn't interest me.

503
00:43:01,269 --> 00:43:02,939
You never buy anything.

504
00:43:03,516 --> 00:43:07,914
I do. Bread, milk, matches,
vegetables, tomatoes, mustard...

505
00:43:08,203 --> 00:43:10,450
Nothing for you.
- I don't need anything.

506
00:43:11,895 --> 00:43:14,592
You could buy a sweater...
- I've already got 2.

507
00:43:14,792 --> 00:43:16,092
That's not much, is it?

508
00:43:17,201 --> 00:43:20,410
No visits?
- No.

509
00:43:20,625 --> 00:43:22,393
I don't want to see anyone.

510
00:43:24,510 --> 00:43:26,661
How about we
stay out all night...

511
00:43:27,176 --> 00:43:29,454
We go to bed
very late.

512
00:43:30,225 --> 00:43:31,701
That's different.

513
00:43:33,371 --> 00:43:36,325
Hello. How are you today?

514
00:43:44,510 --> 00:43:46,630
Is it good?
Very good.

515
00:43:49,358 --> 00:43:51,123
Something's gone wrong.

516
00:43:53,050 --> 00:43:54,847
I don't know what
time it is.

517
00:43:55,874 --> 00:43:59,637
They didn't give me
a watch.

518
00:44:00,637 --> 00:44:02,274
That's the limit.

519
00:44:02,375 --> 00:44:05,220
There aren't watches
for time travelling.

520
00:44:05,651 --> 00:44:07,336
I could...

521
00:44:09,636 --> 00:44:11,836
...count the seconds...

522
00:44:12,636 --> 00:44:14,336
...to calm myself.

523
00:44:16,388 --> 00:44:18,443
4 minutes...

524
00:44:20,657 --> 00:44:24,413
one... two... three...

525
00:44:25,313 --> 00:44:27,513
...four...five...

526
00:44:27,841 --> 00:44:29,139
No.
- What d'you mean 'no'?

527
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:31,274
No.
- But what kind of 'no'?

528
00:44:31,574 --> 00:44:33,274
Just 'no'.

529
00:44:33,474 --> 00:44:35,474
Why not?
- Because no.

530
00:44:35,527 --> 00:44:37,180
Because not yes?

531
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:39,023
Yes.
- Ah, but you said 'yes'!

532
00:44:39,124 --> 00:44:41,860
But no.
- She sure knows how to say 'no'.

533
00:44:46,442 --> 00:44:48,143
Can't they tell?

534
00:44:52,214 --> 00:44:54,012
I'm here!

535
00:44:59,597 --> 00:45:01,685
They must know it!

536
00:45:09,550 --> 00:45:10,994
I'm back!

537
00:45:11,725 --> 00:45:13,458
I'm here!

538
00:45:23,651 --> 00:45:27,270
One travels for a few minutes,
and centuries have passed outside.

539
00:45:27,808 --> 00:45:30,470
Those responsible died
long ago...

540
00:45:30,570 --> 00:45:32,170
...and I'm here...

541
00:45:32,470 --> 00:45:33,870
...forgotten.

542
00:45:34,155 --> 00:45:37,736
One minute.
- We'll get him back in three minutes.

543
00:45:39,983 --> 00:45:43,802
Oh, there you are!
How have you been?

544
00:45:47,104 --> 00:45:48,870
You're on a trip too.

545
00:45:49,961 --> 00:45:52,434
Did it go well?
Did you go far away?

546
00:45:54,587 --> 00:45:58,280
They can't get you
back either.

547
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:01,843
We're both in a mess.

548
00:46:04,283 --> 00:46:06,305
I know you.

549
00:46:07,076 --> 00:46:11,603
You're the mouse I saw on the beach.
You caught my eye.

550
00:46:12,747 --> 00:46:16,517
You wander through my past
here and there.

551
00:46:16,717 --> 00:46:19,817
What would you say if I
wandered through yours?

552
00:46:20,017 --> 00:46:24,117
In the end, you see,
everything can be explained.

553
00:46:25,017 --> 00:46:27,017
Everything is reasonable.

554
00:46:30,381 --> 00:46:32,170
You don't have
a watch either.

555
00:46:32,370 --> 00:46:36,270
You don't know how long
we've been here for either.

556
00:46:41,073 --> 00:46:46,145
It's continuing.
I have to get out of here!

557
00:46:48,038 --> 00:46:49,451
I have to concentrate.

558
00:46:49,293 --> 00:46:50,866
It's 10:30, you know

559
00:46:51,612 --> 00:46:53,945
I feel awful.
- Are you sick?

560
00:46:54,523 --> 00:46:56,224
If Catherine had died,
we'd have heard about it.

561
00:46:56,307 --> 00:46:59,613
It's not impossible. It's so simple.
Do you know anything about Catherine?

562
00:47:00,143 --> 00:47:01,636
You've been telling me
about her for years.

563
00:47:01,836 --> 00:47:03,636
But have you met her?
Have you ever seen her?

564
00:47:03,836 --> 00:47:05,036
No, never.

565
00:47:05,066 --> 00:47:07,955
The few people I knew
never saw her.

566
00:47:08,330 --> 00:47:11,531
It's been years since I've seen them.
They don't even know if I live with her or not.

567
00:47:12,243 --> 00:47:15,197
You hid her.
- People bored her.

568
00:47:15,871 --> 00:47:17,380
She had family?

569
00:47:17,862 --> 00:47:19,660
No, no cousins, no friends.

570
00:47:20,333 --> 00:47:22,228
...no boss, no job...
She didn't even pay taxes.

571
00:47:23,030 --> 00:47:26,432
To go overseas, she needed papers,
and she didn't have any.

572
00:47:27,107 --> 00:47:29,128
No one worried about
her disappearance.

573
00:47:29,328 --> 00:47:30,807
No. Nobody.

574
00:47:31,008 --> 00:47:34,426
People think we've separated,
just as you did.

575
00:47:36,673 --> 00:47:38,663
You left her there?

576
00:47:39,756 --> 00:47:41,681
Why bring her back?

577
00:47:48,808 --> 00:47:50,382
Why tell me all this?

578
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:52,275
Because nobody knows.

579
00:47:58,877 --> 00:48:02,142
You see what you're doing,
you let me caress you...

580
00:48:02,342 --> 00:48:04,842
You'd make love to me.

581
00:48:06,882 --> 00:48:09,032
Yet you say you love that man.

582
00:48:10,664 --> 00:48:14,550
I am, you are, he is, we love each other,
you love, they lie down.

583
00:48:15,448 --> 00:48:17,639
I caress... your knees.

584
00:48:18,902 --> 00:48:21,139
Then your thighs.

585
00:48:22,354 --> 00:48:24,730
Because tonight I feel abandoned.

586
00:48:24,930 --> 00:48:26,130
Abandoned...

587
00:48:30,154 --> 00:48:32,532
If Catherine left me
I'd be thrilled.

588
00:48:37,475 --> 00:48:39,016
I once knew a man...

589
00:48:42,290 --> 00:48:44,473
You are not listening.

590
00:48:45,211 --> 00:48:47,919
I'm listening to your fingers.

591
00:48:55,823 --> 00:48:58,165
Since last week you've
had a different expression.

592
00:48:58,405 --> 00:49:00,954
Because last week
I was sure...

593
00:49:00,954 --> 00:49:03,154
...that I wouldn't write
to you again.

594
00:49:04,665 --> 00:49:07,073
You said the same thing last year.

595
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:14,521
I'll show you something
you'll like.

596
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:19,381
Is it big?
- No it's actually tiny.

597
00:49:19,392 --> 00:49:22,321
You'll like it because it's tiny.

598
00:49:24,986 --> 00:49:28,421
Animal, vegetable.
astral or mineral?

599
00:49:29,929 --> 00:49:31,437
A mixture.

600
00:49:33,397 --> 00:49:35,258
I want to stay
with you tonight.

601
00:49:47,483 --> 00:49:49,954
What's wrong?
- I'm terrified.

602
00:49:50,167 --> 00:49:52,791
Don't say 'terrified'.
You're just afraid.

603
00:49:52,991 --> 00:49:54,191
For no reason.

604
00:49:54,656 --> 00:49:57,506
What's the difference between
'afraid' and 'terrified'?

605
00:49:57,644 --> 00:50:00,651
Fear is when you feel hot.
Terror is when you feel cold.

606
00:50:00,722 --> 00:50:04,843
You haven't shut your eyes more than
one or two hours. You need to sleep.

607
00:50:05,845 --> 00:50:07,900
One of my eyes wants to read
and the other wants to sleep.

608
00:50:08,701 --> 00:50:11,463
You are absolutely...

609
00:50:13,036 --> 00:50:16,503
...I don't know what...
But you are it absolutely.

610
00:50:16,994 --> 00:50:20,416
Now I'm afraid too.
- Of what, of dying?

611
00:50:20,821 --> 00:50:22,265
Not exactly.

612
00:50:22,304 --> 00:50:26,683
I'm afraid of not dying.
- I've never heard such a thing.

613
00:50:27,288 --> 00:50:28,894
You still here?

614
00:50:29,696 --> 00:50:31,269
Will you be out late?

615
00:50:31,879 --> 00:50:34,512
Yes. He lives quite
far away.

616
00:50:36,053 --> 00:50:37,882
It's too hot in here.

617
00:50:46,646 --> 00:50:50,498
Come with me.

618
00:50:53,902 --> 00:50:56,021
I've called a taxi.

619
00:50:57,625 --> 00:50:59,359
Glasgow is too gloomy.

620
00:51:00,386 --> 00:51:02,473
Buy me some oranges.

621
00:51:14,864 --> 00:51:16,982
Are you okay?
- Yes.

622
00:51:17,882 --> 00:51:19,775
Can't you sleep?

623
00:51:20,418 --> 00:51:22,023
I wanted the light on.

624
00:51:22,665 --> 00:51:24,142
Here, come close to me.

625
00:51:27,994 --> 00:51:30,659
Simple things are harder
to understand.

626
00:51:31,018 --> 00:51:32,945
But you did go to school.

627
00:51:33,810 --> 00:51:36,187
Yes, but I never listened.

628
00:51:36,958 --> 00:51:39,173
But you read, don't you?

629
00:51:39,750 --> 00:51:41,645
Books don't teach everything.

630
00:51:42,447 --> 00:51:46,202
One day Claude told me
the electric cable...

631
00:51:46,845 --> 00:51:49,830
...kept the streetcars from falling
off the tracks.

632
00:51:50,473 --> 00:51:52,239
I'd never thought of it.

633
00:51:52,976 --> 00:51:54,518
I thought they ran on gas.

634
00:51:54,607 --> 00:51:56,664
It's all right. It's what they call
"The Martian Viewpoint".

635
00:51:57,343 --> 00:51:59,847
Missed by two minutes.
- It's as bad as two months.

636
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:02,383
The T. 5. has worn off by now.

637
00:52:08,257 --> 00:52:10,215
Three circulars at least.
We've received complaints about it.

638
00:52:11,017 --> 00:52:12,943
Better write a new text.

639
00:52:13,153 --> 00:52:14,969
You'll have it next week.

640
00:52:15,069 --> 00:52:18,582
The release for the seventeenth.
Five days more, the twenty second....

641
00:52:18,643 --> 00:52:22,196
It'll have to be out after the 25th
to meet the payments.

642
00:52:22,239 --> 00:52:24,136
We haven't talked about the
number of pages yet. How many?

643
00:52:24,283 --> 00:52:27,460
If we have 40 pages more,
It won't cost be the same price.

644
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:30,360
It needs to be cut back.
Who'll take care of it?

645
00:52:30,986 --> 00:52:33,489
We still can't send them
before the 17th.

646
00:52:33,995 --> 00:52:37,205
Mouse B travelled in time.
He's been 1 minute into the past.

647
00:52:37,816 --> 00:52:39,612
A hero! When?

648
00:52:40,417 --> 00:52:42,245
Yesterday.
With no ill effects.

649
00:52:42,567 --> 00:52:45,425
How do you know
it really happened?

650
00:52:46,548 --> 00:52:48,249
That's the problem...

651
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:52,676
If during the war someone had
told me that I'd be talking about this...

652
00:52:52,876 --> 00:52:54,321
Where are you going?

653
00:52:54,422 --> 00:52:56,049
I'll go buy some cigarettes.

654
00:53:03,561 --> 00:53:05,649
What are you doing here?

655
00:53:06,849 --> 00:53:07,849
What?

656
00:53:08,749 --> 00:53:10,649
What are you doing here?

657
00:53:12,101 --> 00:53:14,027
I couldn't sleep.

658
00:53:16,210 --> 00:53:17,654
I was afraid I'd die.

659
00:53:18,650 --> 00:53:20,351
So I came here.

660
00:53:21,866 --> 00:53:24,360
Tomorrow, when you go out,

661
00:53:25,215 --> 00:53:27,238
you'd have found me dead
on the stairs,

662
00:53:28,409 --> 00:53:30,014
...or simply sleeping.

663
00:53:32,614 --> 00:53:34,214
Come with me.
Come.

664
00:53:34,235 --> 00:53:38,794
I found a girl I didn't know
in the bathroom...

665
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:42,582
She was very attractive.

666
00:53:43,255 --> 00:53:45,311
Every man's dream.

667
00:53:45,952 --> 00:53:48,231
Nothing happened.

668
00:53:48,842 --> 00:53:52,117
I just washed her
as she asked me to.

669
00:53:52,687 --> 00:53:56,122
Have you seen her again?
- Often, in my dreams.

670
00:54:10,856 --> 00:54:15,640
We accolege reseat of
your of the 2nd...

671
00:54:16,249 --> 00:54:20,165
Happy to learn that
you never deceived...

672
00:54:20,936 --> 00:54:23,376
...our watchamacallit...

673
00:54:23,729 --> 00:54:28,159
We'll fend you a new one...

674
00:54:28,833 --> 00:54:31,786
...and cope it
alives chafely...

675
00:54:32,526 --> 00:54:37,051
Except our exclusives.

676
00:54:37,662 --> 00:54:39,717
Yours, screwly,
Claude Ridder.

677
00:54:41,096 --> 00:54:43,119
I killed Catherine in Glasgow
2 months ago.

678
00:54:47,788 --> 00:54:50,068
It's late.
We needed it yesterday.

679
00:54:50,958 --> 00:54:52,693
We can work all night.

680
00:54:53,566 --> 00:54:55,942
How can he work without a pencil?
- It's his custom.

681
00:54:56,455 --> 00:54:58,285
Does he know we
need it for tomorrow?

682
00:54:59,665 --> 00:55:01,592
Only his is lacking.

683
00:55:02,136 --> 00:55:03,646
Can't spell "tomorrow".

684
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:06,889
It's late.
Isn't he tired?

685
00:55:07,434 --> 00:55:09,457
And this mark?
Has he seen this mark?

686
00:55:21,416 --> 00:55:24,337
You're right about the colour green
and the countryside.

687
00:55:25,525 --> 00:55:27,804
And if man were allergic to
the colour green?

688
00:55:28,415 --> 00:55:31,785
Perhaps it's green which
ruins our cells.

689
00:55:32,684 --> 00:55:38,460
Thousands of scientists invent
can openers, detergents...

690
00:55:41,203 --> 00:55:45,215
and bypass this,
which would change everything.

691
00:55:45,621 --> 00:55:47,388
I believe that's the secret.

692
00:55:47,964 --> 00:55:49,634
It's so simple that
no one has thought of it.

693
00:55:50,725 --> 00:55:53,293
We'll give up salad for
a month to test it.

694
00:55:55,156 --> 00:55:58,205
If you buy a boat,
I'll learn to steer...

695
00:55:58,580 --> 00:56:01,790
If I weren't sad for this reason,
I'd find another.

696
00:56:03,895 --> 00:56:05,596
I'm just a burden for you.

697
00:56:06,367 --> 00:56:09,192
If I only had money...

698
00:56:10,731 --> 00:56:14,136
I don't know if I'd have
liked you if you were rich.

699
00:56:15,066 --> 00:56:17,422
I'd have pretend to be poor
and disinherited.

700
00:56:17,622 --> 00:56:18,822
I'd have gone to see
your boss...

701
00:56:19,022 --> 00:56:20,222
to arrange for him to
give you some money.

702
00:56:22,449 --> 00:56:24,376
Oh! A tree!

703
00:56:26,624 --> 00:56:28,549
It's not a tree;
it's a weed.

704
00:56:29,191 --> 00:56:31,630
Yes, but the trees are
appearing less frequently

705
00:56:32,305 --> 00:56:34,746
I showed you a rubber tree
that you missed.

706
00:56:35,579 --> 00:56:37,441
Are you sure?

707
00:56:38,565 --> 00:56:40,106
Are you sure?
- Yes.

708
00:56:41,229 --> 00:56:43,316
Okay, leave the other one,
and take that one.

709
00:56:43,789 --> 00:56:46,461
Yes, it's better.
- I'll tell them.

710
00:56:47,554 --> 00:56:48,997
But the other one...

711
00:56:50,897 --> 00:56:52,297
I assure you
I'm not mistaken.

712
00:56:52,362 --> 00:56:55,241
It was you got me my false papers
during the  war.

713
00:56:55,241 --> 00:56:56,441
I don't know you.

714
00:56:57,345 --> 00:56:59,559
Don't you know me?
My name is Claude Ridder.

715
00:57:01,004 --> 00:57:03,893
I was called Claude Rabois in 1943.

716
00:57:04,893 --> 00:57:06,093
You can't know me.

717
00:57:06,799 --> 00:57:09,600
I had false papers too
during the war.

718
00:57:11,181 --> 00:57:13,524
You have a calcite.

719
00:57:14,776 --> 00:57:17,216
Is it serious?
Not terribly.

720
00:57:21,004 --> 00:57:23,797
You killed her
all the same.

721
00:57:30,281 --> 00:57:31,886
That'll be 90 francs.

722
00:57:32,399 --> 00:57:34,134
Shall I come back?

723
00:57:34,415 --> 00:57:36,817
Are you tired?
- Yes, exhausted.

724
00:57:36,855 --> 00:57:39,324
What have you been doing?
- Nothing.

725
00:57:39,524 --> 00:57:40,724
I listened to people talking.

726
00:57:42,088 --> 00:57:43,949
Didn't you talk?
- I didn't say a word.

727
00:57:44,528 --> 00:57:45,909
What did they talk about?

728
00:57:46,422 --> 00:57:48,477
Nothing. I wasn't listening.

729
00:57:51,309 --> 00:57:54,648
What are you looking for?
- Something to eat.

730
00:57:55,193 --> 00:57:56,896
I bought spinach.

731
00:57:58,437 --> 00:58:00,041
Plants...

732
00:58:00,554 --> 00:58:05,337
I'd like huge herring.

733
00:58:08,130 --> 00:58:09,865
I can't do anything.

734
00:58:10,313 --> 00:58:12,690
I wonder, who are you in reality?

735
00:58:13,814 --> 00:58:16,060
Something blurred...

736
00:58:17,377 --> 00:58:19,688
...more and more blurred...

737
00:58:20,458 --> 00:58:22,738
I shrink in water.

738
00:58:24,652 --> 00:58:26,803
You never tell me
what you write about.

739
00:58:27,777 --> 00:58:30,056
I don't write much.

740
00:58:35,161 --> 00:58:37,183
If you like we can go
together to eat.

741
00:58:37,525 --> 00:58:40,783
What worries me is that if
you killed her, it was the perfect crime.

742
00:58:41,083 --> 00:58:42,283
It'll be closed.

743
00:58:42,824 --> 00:58:44,086
Okay, I'll go and get dressed.

744
00:58:46,686 --> 00:58:48,258
I like it when you wear mauve.

745
00:59:53,105 --> 00:59:57,246
Imagine for a moment if God
had created the cat in His own image?

746
00:59:57,446 --> 00:59:58,846
The cat?
- Yes, the cat.

747
00:59:59,250 --> 01:00:02,489
Then after a thousand years, or a few hours,
I don't know, He created man...

748
01:00:02,489 --> 01:00:03,497
Man?
- Yes, man...

749
01:00:03,698 --> 01:00:07,102
...with the only object of
serving the cat, like a slave.

750
01:00:07,302 --> 01:00:09,002
Like a slave?
- Exactly.

751
01:00:09,592 --> 01:00:12,541
The cat received lucidity...

752
01:00:12,815 --> 01:00:15,930
And man received neuroses and
the passion for making and owning things.

753
01:00:16,264 --> 01:00:18,323
I see.
- No, you don't see anything.

754
01:00:19,429 --> 01:00:22,220
Man was created
for the cat's sake.

755
01:00:22,420 --> 01:00:24,320
Do you understand?
- Yes, yes, I get it.

756
01:00:24,492 --> 01:00:25,544
There you have it.

757
01:00:25,644 --> 01:00:28,244
All of the civilisation that he
has constructed has no other aim...

758
01:00:28,449 --> 01:00:31,500
...than to feed and comfort the cat.

759
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,500
The cat.
- Exactly.

760
01:00:33,553 --> 01:00:36,572
He invented lots of things,

761
01:00:37,310 --> 01:00:40,231
...only for the cat's wellbeing.

762
01:00:40,744 --> 01:00:45,464
Fishermen, cushions,
carpet and the radiators...

763
01:00:46,459 --> 01:00:49,285
Maybe even the radio,
because cats love music.

764
01:00:50,022 --> 01:00:53,617
I'm glad to know you've discovered
who we are and why we're here.

765
01:00:54,196 --> 01:00:56,797
So am I, but you see,
it's all a question of thinking.

766
01:00:57,097 --> 01:00:57,997
Claude!

767
01:00:58,597 --> 01:00:59,797
Look!

768
01:01:02,222 --> 01:01:03,857
What is it?

769
01:01:04,597 --> 01:01:06,169
A beetle.

770
01:01:07,358 --> 01:01:10,214
You've been like this for two hours.
What's the matter?

771
01:01:11,145 --> 01:01:13,007
Nothing's the matter.

772
01:01:14,162 --> 01:01:15,928
Where's the cat?

773
01:01:25,848 --> 01:01:27,839
Did she sleep with you?

774
01:01:28,673 --> 01:01:31,049
Does it annoy you?
And you, do you find it amusing?

775
01:01:34,387 --> 01:01:36,121
You have a side that's very superficial.

776
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:13,808
I always dreamed of having something
with an especially inept employee...

777
01:02:15,172 --> 01:02:16,391
Fire her...

778
01:02:17,191 --> 01:02:18,991
and escape with her.

779
01:02:22,885 --> 01:02:25,454
I promise, once my three months notice
are through, we'll go together

780
01:02:27,774 --> 01:02:29,346
...somewhere.

781
01:02:30,146 --> 01:02:31,346
And after that?

782
01:02:34,739 --> 01:02:35,999
Then we'll come back...

783
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:40,558
Come back.

784
01:02:48,607 --> 01:02:50,277
Another coffee?

785
01:02:51,271 --> 01:02:54,963
I'd like to know how was it
that I was picked for this?

786
01:02:55,406 --> 01:02:57,493
Let's say a computer did it.

787
01:02:58,262 --> 01:02:59,900
Out of millions, obviously.
- Of course.

788
01:03:00,100 --> 01:03:01,300
Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

789
01:03:01,699 --> 01:03:03,463
Our oldest employee.

790
01:03:04,267 --> 01:03:05,870
Maybe he's the computer
who picked me.

791
01:03:10,333 --> 01:03:13,094
This will do it good.
It needs refreshment.

792
01:03:13,928 --> 01:03:16,336
Could you imagine being buried
all alone in this cold dirt?

793
01:03:17,652 --> 01:03:22,051
You could do a guide to graveyards.
It would be a best-seller.

794
01:03:22,756 --> 01:03:26,067
Luceram cemetery. One shinbone.
Modest, but good location.

795
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:29,724
Another one: Three shinbones.
Worth a detour.

796
01:03:30,333 --> 01:03:32,901
No shinbone.
Avoid.

797
01:03:33,447 --> 01:03:36,143
I'd rather live here
than die here.

798
01:03:37,332 --> 01:03:39,407
These situations only
occur in books.

799
01:03:39,607 --> 01:03:42,707
And when they occur, one doesn't take advantage.
- That's still to be seen.

800
01:03:52,612 --> 01:03:54,698
I don't mean
to scare you.

801
01:03:57,330 --> 01:03:58,781
I killed Catherine in Glasgow
two months ago.

802
01:04:01,601 --> 01:04:03,911
I went with her
without telling anybody...

803
01:04:04,585 --> 01:04:06,512
...and I came back alone.

804
01:04:07,474 --> 01:04:09,144
I don't believe it.

805
01:04:09,626 --> 01:04:11,320
You're right and wrong.

806
01:04:11,420 --> 01:04:12,574
What does that mean?

807
01:04:12,575 --> 01:04:16,051
You're right, I'm not capable of killing,
but you're wrong...

808
01:04:16,251 --> 01:04:17,451
...because I still did it.

809
01:04:17,510 --> 01:04:18,775
Impossible.

810
01:04:19,375 --> 01:04:21,675
That's what I thought too.

811
01:04:23,875 --> 01:04:26,375
That day, it was very cold
in Glasgow.

812
01:04:27,075 --> 01:04:29,075
Catherine had never gone
that far before.

813
01:04:30,275 --> 01:04:31,475
Me either.

814
01:04:31,554 --> 01:04:33,195
She didn't like the city;
she thought it gloomy.

815
01:04:35,603 --> 01:04:39,060
I think I'd never seen Catherine as
depressed as she was that day.

816
01:04:43,494 --> 01:04:45,548
She was absolutely...

817
01:04:58,700 --> 01:05:00,945
We haven't slept
all night.

818
01:05:01,268 --> 01:05:03,321
I'll be exhausted tomorrow.

819
01:05:03,643 --> 01:05:05,664
Let's try to sleep a little.

820
01:05:11,733 --> 01:05:15,873
It's strange to wake up exactly
when I was planning to sleep again.

821
01:05:31,829 --> 01:05:33,818
She was asleep.

822
01:05:35,231 --> 01:05:38,697
And the strange thing was
that she was smiling... in her sleep.

823
01:05:40,285 --> 01:05:44,041
I'd never seen he smiling in
her sleep. It was the first time.

824
01:05:46,242 --> 01:05:49,935
She looked relaxed... happy.

825
01:05:54,363 --> 01:05:56,264
That's how it all happened.

826
01:06:02,390 --> 01:06:04,027
I looked at Catherine...

827
01:06:04,902 --> 01:06:06,539
29 minutes.

828
01:06:07,727 --> 01:06:09,492
What have you decided?

829
01:06:11,692 --> 01:06:12,792
And the risks?

830
01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:16,036
We must try whatever we can
because the T.5. is no longer working.

831
01:06:18,063 --> 01:06:19,669
Are you Mr. Ridder?

832
01:06:20,569 --> 01:06:21,569
Yes, that's me.

833
01:06:21,715 --> 01:06:24,219
Wiana went out.
She went to the post-office.

834
01:06:24,419 --> 01:06:25,819
That's alright. I'll wait.

835
01:06:26,571 --> 01:06:28,594
Come in
if you like.

836
01:06:29,075 --> 01:06:30,808
We're two girls here
in the bathroom.

837
01:06:31,065 --> 01:06:34,211
Which one will you take?
The one on the right or on the left?

838
01:06:36,483 --> 01:06:37,487
The left one.

839
01:06:38,387 --> 01:06:39,387
Or if not...

840
01:06:40,187 --> 01:06:42,287
No. The one on the left.

841
01:06:43,987 --> 01:06:45,687
You chose badly.

842
01:06:45,784 --> 01:06:50,773
I'm Nicole. I arrived yesterday.
Do you mind if I take a bath?

843
01:06:51,115 --> 01:06:54,966
Wash my back
while we talk.

844
01:06:55,913 --> 01:06:57,824
What do you do
at the office?

845
01:07:01,113 --> 01:07:02,814
Sometimes I think.

846
01:07:03,038 --> 01:07:05,607
I pick up an object
and I start to think.

847
01:07:06,667 --> 01:07:09,492
Here is a pen.

848
01:07:09,692 --> 01:07:12,092
I concentrate and I see
that it's a red pencil.

849
01:07:13,794 --> 01:07:15,526
It's red on the outside
but it writes black.

850
01:07:15,705 --> 01:07:17,277
Proof that appearances
are deceiving.

851
01:07:18,705 --> 01:07:21,123
It's of normal size;
a common pencil...

852
01:07:21,370 --> 01:07:24,418
...of the kind found everywhere.

853
01:07:26,282 --> 01:07:27,886
It has a point...

854
01:07:28,592 --> 01:07:30,390
...like a pencil.

855
01:07:31,482 --> 01:07:35,237
When you push it,
It rolls...

856
01:07:35,943 --> 01:07:38,031
...like a pencil, naturally.

857
01:07:38,575 --> 01:07:40,919
If you hold it up...

858
01:07:41,240 --> 01:07:44,033
...it looks like the trunk
of a tree, smooth and straight ...

859
01:07:45,286 --> 01:07:47,468
In the same way,
it also looks like a pencil.

860
01:07:47,468 --> 01:07:49,468
So it would seem that
we are dealing with a pencil

861
01:07:49,542 --> 01:07:52,141
On the other hand,
I never use a pencil

862
01:07:52,518 --> 01:07:54,112
Why would I have one
in this case?

863
01:07:54,162 --> 01:07:59,073
Doubtless because tables
are meant for holding pencils.

864
01:08:02,085 --> 01:08:04,301
I like your story.
Keep going.

865
01:08:04,401 --> 01:08:06,201
There are other things
apart from pencils.

866
01:08:06,617 --> 01:08:08,829
There are also erasers,
pads, paper...

867
01:08:09,780 --> 01:08:10,941
She has received over
150 letters of complaint.

868
01:08:10,941 --> 01:08:12,141
And she has them piled up there.

869
01:08:12,250 --> 01:08:13,920
They said there were 300 letters
that were late.

870
01:08:14,320 --> 01:08:15,296
And now?

871
01:08:15,297 --> 01:08:18,026
We've caught up.
- Even a bit ahead.

872
01:08:18,926 --> 01:08:21,126
Claude told me this morning
that he'd responded to a letter...

873
01:08:21,521 --> 01:08:23,559
...that we haven't got yet.

874
01:08:23,617 --> 01:08:27,988
I'm absolutely exhausted.
I hardly slept 3 hours last night.

875
01:08:28,188 --> 01:08:31,288
And besides that, I dreamed
that I had to do 100 pages.

876
01:08:35,132 --> 01:08:36,705
It's going to be a nice day.

877
01:08:38,305 --> 01:08:40,305
One knows these things by the sea.

878
01:08:44,667 --> 01:08:48,840
If people are up, it's...

879
01:08:49,803 --> 01:08:51,536
Everything's ready.

880
01:08:52,974 --> 01:08:56,377
Is it much?
- 5 whole years.

881
01:08:57,186 --> 01:08:58,856
It'll be a few days.

882
01:09:16,062 --> 01:09:19,144
Even though I make love to other girls,
I feel drawn to you.

883
01:09:19,753 --> 01:09:22,483
It's hurtful that you do it
with other girls.

884
01:09:24,634 --> 01:09:26,999
I don't know what to say.

885
01:09:30,399 --> 01:09:31,699
Do you understand?

886
01:09:33,559 --> 01:09:36,704
Yes, Claude, I do.
That's why I'm sad.

887
01:09:37,379 --> 01:09:39,562
If Prometheus didn't have
his vulture...

888
01:09:39,571 --> 01:09:41,272
Speaking of vultures,
I bought a chicken for tonight.

889
01:09:42,092 --> 01:09:46,014
I don't know what to do.
I can't get down to work.

890
01:09:46,456 --> 01:09:48,222
Move about, I don't know,
do something.

891
01:09:49,673 --> 01:09:52,531
What did I do this morning?
I kept watching the telephone.

892
01:09:53,522 --> 01:09:55,447
What does that girl have?

893
01:09:55,662 --> 01:09:57,587
Nothing.
But I want her.

894
01:10:01,584 --> 01:10:04,376
I'd do anything for her.

895
01:10:04,882 --> 01:10:08,028
Including sending Catherine to hell.

896
01:10:08,773 --> 01:10:10,192
Well, call her.

897
01:10:10,581 --> 01:10:12,828
I don't have her number.

898
01:10:13,278 --> 01:10:15,943
All I can do is wait.

899
01:10:16,921 --> 01:10:18,133
A kiss?

900
01:10:18,333 --> 01:10:20,433
I won't be able to stand it.
- I'd like it very much.

901
01:10:36,524 --> 01:10:38,774
He's all right.
- He's completely immobilised.

902
01:10:46,253 --> 01:10:48,340
Let's wait a bit longer.

903
01:10:48,347 --> 01:10:50,352
The minute flees,
but I look for it.

904
01:10:51,329 --> 01:10:53,640
I concentrate on
that minute.

905
01:10:54,860 --> 01:10:58,712
I'm in the water.
The sun's hot...

906
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:04,009
Catherine is there, on the beach.

907
01:11:05,808 --> 01:11:06,528
The water's warm...

908
01:11:07,428 --> 01:11:08,628
I swim in it.

909
01:11:10,428 --> 01:11:11,628
I see the bottom.

910
01:11:27,766 --> 01:11:29,595
I want to swim.

911
01:11:33,395 --> 01:11:34,295
Thank you.

912
01:11:35,214 --> 01:11:38,386
Sorry, I don't speak French.

913
01:11:38,586 --> 01:11:40,786
But you understand English, I hope.

914
01:11:41,086 --> 01:11:42,686
Yes, without a problem.

915
01:11:43,239 --> 01:11:45,229
Then where is Catherine?

916
01:11:53,729 --> 01:11:55,629
Catherine!

917
01:12:03,028 --> 01:12:05,921
In the end...
- Yes, in the end...

918
01:12:06,802 --> 01:12:08,183
Nothing...

919
01:12:08,784 --> 01:12:10,164
Do you have to go?

920
01:12:10,512 --> 01:12:11,736
I should.

921
01:12:13,989 --> 01:12:15,916
Stay with me.

922
01:12:17,583 --> 01:12:19,736
I can't find an excuse
every day.

923
01:12:20,988 --> 01:12:23,913
I'll write you an encyclopaedia
with all the excuses you can use.

924
01:12:24,775 --> 01:12:26,413
You're already late.

925
01:12:26,787 --> 01:12:30,185
Like every day, punctually late,
never more than an hour.

926
01:12:30,529 --> 01:12:31,617
And occasionally less.

927
01:12:33,732 --> 01:12:35,432
Seen many fish?

928
01:12:35,978 --> 01:12:37,873
2 sea snakes,
some sharks...

929
01:12:38,322 --> 01:12:40,377
Nothing at all.

930
01:12:42,367 --> 01:12:44,262
Nothing changes.

931
01:12:49,366 --> 01:12:51,055
It's strange.

932
01:12:51,256 --> 01:12:52,843
I'm going to die.

933
01:12:58,150 --> 01:13:00,317
Catherine...

934
01:13:01,217 --> 01:13:02,517
Do you realise?

935
01:13:04,133 --> 01:13:06,219
...you were right.

936
01:13:15,419 --> 01:13:16,619
Catherine...

937
01:13:21,849 --> 01:13:23,290
I'd like to see the mouse.

938
01:13:23,970 --> 01:13:25,930
He's coming back more often.

939
01:13:26,410 --> 01:13:28,176
An interval of 30 seconds
since last time.

940
01:13:28,690 --> 01:13:30,392
That's not much.

941
01:13:35,785 --> 01:13:38,385
A storm at 7 a.m.
is unusual.

942
01:13:39,701 --> 01:13:41,563
People get up early.

943
01:13:41,663 --> 01:13:42,863
Who?

944
01:13:44,099 --> 01:13:46,860
God... the workers...

945
01:13:47,824 --> 01:13:50,110
You don't understand...
- Not today.

946
01:13:51,856 --> 01:13:54,429
You're lucky.
You're all blind.

947
01:13:55,272 --> 01:13:58,193
People are scared because they have
a hard life, discouraging.

948
01:13:58,706 --> 01:14:00,729
In those moments, they should be
convinced of the reverse.

949
01:14:00,974 --> 01:14:03,060
I doubt it. It won't last.

950
01:14:03,431 --> 01:14:05,134
Finally, it goes by fast.

951
01:14:06,603 --> 01:14:08,433
When you're okay,
that's when it's scary...

952
01:14:09,075 --> 01:14:11,547
You know that one day it'll all be lost,
and it's unsupportable.

953
01:14:11,889 --> 01:14:13,593
It's unsupportable,
and the rest doesn't matter.

954
01:14:15,777 --> 01:14:17,574
When you're hungry,
time drags...

955
01:14:18,321 --> 01:14:20,953
It takes 3 months or 60 years to die...

956
01:14:20,953 --> 01:14:22,453
It's strange, isn't it?

957
01:14:22,566 --> 01:14:25,347
One even adapts to cancer.

958
01:14:27,758 --> 01:14:29,235
Choose something...

959
01:14:32,124 --> 01:14:35,142
Carrots are good
for the skin.

960
01:14:35,719 --> 01:14:38,513
After... Spinach for influenza...

961
01:14:39,058 --> 01:14:42,236
Fruit, of course,
is good for your health.

962
01:14:42,360 --> 01:14:44,769
I don't think I can help you.

963
01:14:46,064 --> 01:14:47,437
I wish I'd never met you.

964
01:14:47,613 --> 01:14:51,242
That can't be changed.

965
01:14:58,969 --> 01:15:02,853
Something to drink?
- I can't drink; it makes me sleepy.

966
01:15:05,164 --> 01:15:07,026
Have you been
here long?

967
01:15:08,226 --> 01:15:10,226
Hello, how are you?

968
01:15:23,335 --> 01:15:25,453
There it is; we can work now.

969
01:15:25,742 --> 01:15:27,314
We haven't brought
all the documents.

970
01:15:28,928 --> 01:15:33,678
Hello, cat...
I'm happy to see you.

971
01:15:34,290 --> 01:15:36,279
Have you eaten well today?

972
01:15:37,035 --> 01:15:40,053
'I tell you this woman doesn't
give me enough to eat.'

973
01:15:42,347 --> 01:15:44,305
Yes, I think she's a bit stingy.

974
01:15:44,595 --> 01:15:46,858
'Stingy.'

975
01:15:47,159 --> 01:15:49,420
But on the street, you'd have
less to eat.

976
01:15:50,361 --> 01:15:52,576
'That's no reason for me to starve
in an apartment.'

977
01:15:53,476 --> 01:15:55,369
You exaggerate.

978
01:15:55,883 --> 01:15:58,066
'You won't believe me
if I don't exaggerate.'

979
01:15:59,093 --> 01:16:01,403
'I don't like your records.'

980
01:16:02,016 --> 01:16:04,658
'They're noisy and all
sound the same.'

981
01:16:05,186 --> 01:16:07,692
'I had more fun outside.
I had friends there.'

982
01:16:09,233 --> 01:16:12,181
We're your friends.
You can chat with us.

983
01:16:12,551 --> 01:16:15,079
'But you're not very smart.'

984
01:16:15,658 --> 01:16:17,951
Sophie thinks we are.

985
01:16:19,002 --> 01:16:21,161
What are you reading?

986
01:16:25,861 --> 01:16:27,261
Where did you find this?

987
01:16:27,616 --> 01:16:29,414
What does that mean?
- I don't know.

988
01:16:29,695 --> 01:16:31,705
It bores me to explain.

989
01:16:33,572 --> 01:16:35,403
I couldn't care less.

990
01:16:35,903 --> 01:16:37,103
Why do you say that?

991
01:16:37,128 --> 01:16:39,352
I don't understand this.
It has nothing to do with me.

992
01:16:40,333 --> 01:16:42,053
And with you?
Not me either.

993
01:16:44,387 --> 01:16:47,876
Then it's a bit silly, a bit sad,
depends on how you look at it.

994
01:16:49,532 --> 01:16:52,073
I'm getting mixed up...

995
01:17:08,227 --> 01:17:11,183
I like you a lot.
I like you more than a lot.

996
01:17:13,380 --> 01:17:15,896
You can't say 'more than a lot'.

997
01:17:16,378 --> 01:17:19,368
You can't say it.
- But I can think it, right?

998
01:17:25,609 --> 01:17:29,832
I used to wake up at night.
I hated it.

999
01:17:31,346 --> 01:17:34,438
I stayed awake
so as not to wake up.

1000
01:17:36,271 --> 01:17:39,283
But now it's over.

1001
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:41,884
I sleep until morning.

1002
01:17:42,584 --> 01:17:44,458
I sleep well, don't I?

1003
01:17:51,215 --> 01:17:53,184
Did you ever think
of killing Catherine?

1004
01:17:53,184 --> 01:17:54,084
Many times.

1005
01:17:56,608 --> 01:17:59,578
I believe it.
- Do you?

1006
01:18:03,157 --> 01:18:05,630
I thought all night about
what you told me.

1007
01:18:07,193 --> 01:18:09,231
I think you told the truth.

1008
01:18:10,332 --> 01:18:13,168
It's possible you've killed her
without anybody knowing.

1009
01:18:13,236 --> 01:18:16,609
And do you know why?

1010
01:18:18,720 --> 01:18:20,886
To end it all.

1011
01:18:22,459 --> 01:18:23,970
To end her suffering.

1012
01:18:26,670 --> 01:18:28,570
As you told me,

1013
01:18:28,875 --> 01:18:31,803
She had an incurable,
mortal illness, didn't she?

1014
01:18:31,952 --> 01:18:33,776
The periods vary.

1015
01:18:34,226 --> 01:18:35,665
We can't do anything.

1016
01:18:36,201 --> 01:18:37,680
Then everything is lost.

1017
01:18:40,806 --> 01:18:43,037
I went there to see a writer.
I was there for that.

1018
01:18:44,912 --> 01:18:47,753
We found a room
in a little hotel.

1019
01:18:49,105 --> 01:18:52,145
We turned on the gas heater
because it was a bit chilly.

1020
01:18:52,646 --> 01:18:54,230
She'd taken a sleeping pill.

1021
01:18:56,906 --> 01:18:58,710
When I saw her,
she was asleep,

1022
01:19:00,468 --> 01:19:04,160
The strange thing was that
she was smiling... asleep.

1023
01:19:08,052 --> 01:19:11,380
I'd never seen her smiling in her sleep.
It was the first time.

1024
01:19:12,418 --> 01:19:16,321
She looked relaxed... happy.

1025
01:19:18,656 --> 01:19:20,798
No longer afraid of anything.

1026
01:19:23,349 --> 01:19:25,210
That's how it all happened.

1027
01:19:29,117 --> 01:19:32,523
When I was going out I noticed
that the room was very cold.

1028
01:19:32,623 --> 01:19:34,023
Very cold.

1029
01:19:36,097 --> 01:19:37,966
I smelled gas...

1030
01:19:40,565 --> 01:19:43,481
The heater was off,
but the gas was on...

1031
01:19:43,781 --> 01:19:44,981
That was all.

1032
01:19:49,084 --> 01:19:52,234
I looked at her, smiling in her sleep,
and then I left.

1033
01:19:54,351 --> 01:19:57,094
When I came back an hour later,
she was dead.

1034
01:19:57,537 --> 01:19:59,371
The cops were already there.

1035
01:20:01,022 --> 01:20:04,195
Claude, I don't know why
you're lying to me.

1036
01:20:06,048 --> 01:20:07,868
Why didn't they arrest you?

1037
01:20:09,733 --> 01:20:11,721
They thought it was an accident.

1038
01:20:11,721 --> 01:20:12,721
Just like that?

1039
01:20:13,904 --> 01:20:15,791
It really was an accident.

1040
01:20:17,524 --> 01:20:19,934
I lied to see if
you'd believe me.

1041
01:20:21,427 --> 01:20:24,623
The heater must have
turned off while I was outside.

1042
01:20:25,223 --> 01:20:27,023
I returned...

1043
01:20:27,223 --> 01:20:28,423
...later...

1044
01:20:29,223 --> 01:20:30,423
...that night.

1045
01:20:30,723 --> 01:20:31,923
Much later.

1046
01:20:37,635 --> 01:20:39,737
She really died there?

1047
01:20:40,137 --> 01:20:41,337
Yes.

1048
01:20:43,542 --> 01:20:46,204
For a moment I was glad...

1049
01:20:47,707 --> 01:20:50,077
...though it was horrible,
I was glad.

1050
01:20:51,411 --> 01:20:54,821
Everything happened while she was asleep.
She didn't have to experience her death...

1051
01:20:57,420 --> 01:20:59,855
Then I realized she was
no longer there,

1052
01:21:01,646 --> 01:21:03,779
that she would never be there again.

1053
01:21:05,407 --> 01:21:07,391
And I couldn't stand it.

1054
01:21:12,680 --> 01:21:14,852
It got worse and worse.

1055
01:21:34,616 --> 01:21:37,065
What's wrong?
- Nothing.

1056
01:21:38,138 --> 01:21:40,064
George is dead.

1057
01:21:40,164 --> 01:21:41,364
Which George?

1058
01:21:41,364 --> 01:21:43,464
Slovain.
He's dead.

1059
01:21:44,149 --> 01:21:46,538
I know already.
He died 8 months ago.

1060
01:21:47,222 --> 01:21:48,945
You knew it?

1061
01:21:49,045 --> 01:21:50,527
Eight months ago.

1062
01:21:50,828 --> 01:21:53,183
His wife wrote me
a little after his death.

1063
01:21:53,366 --> 01:21:54,905
And you didn't tell me at all?

1064
01:21:57,401 --> 01:21:59,694
You were depressed,
so I didn't tell you.

1065
01:22:01,551 --> 01:22:03,604
Can you imagine a man...

1066
01:22:03,941 --> 01:22:06,296
...who, to spare his wife...

1067
01:22:07,106 --> 01:22:09,931
...would hide all bad news from her.

1068
01:22:10,789 --> 01:22:13,083
He'd hire actors to replace

1069
01:22:13,611 --> 01:22:16,106
...the people who had died.

1070
01:22:17,547 --> 01:22:24,577
He'd buy all the newspapers so that
she couldn't get one.

1071
01:22:29,001 --> 01:22:31,048
He'd have to cover up
the whole planet.

1072
01:22:32,270 --> 01:22:33,966
It would cost a lot.

1073
01:22:34,667 --> 01:22:36,360
It's ghastly.

1074
01:22:39,586 --> 01:22:41,167
What?

1075
01:22:41,894 --> 01:22:43,609
Everything.

1076
01:22:45,507 --> 01:22:47,391
Even when you're
with me.

1077
01:22:51,621 --> 01:22:55,683
Page 8, first line, put
"Evarista Corriego" in italics.

1078
01:22:56,661 --> 01:22:58,912
Same page, ninth line
after 'the words'...

1079
01:22:59,373 --> 01:23:01,537
the word "conjugated" is lacking.

1080
01:23:01,637 --> 01:23:02,837
With an acute accent and plural.

1081
01:23:04,195 --> 01:23:06,308
Page 9 is all right.

1082
01:23:06,308 --> 01:23:07,508
Page 10, twelfth line.

1083
01:23:08,008 --> 01:23:10,708
'Tln' with diaeresis over the 'o'.

1084
01:23:11,626 --> 01:23:13,111
Same page, 14th line...

1085
01:23:13,311 --> 01:23:16,711
It has 'solipsism' with 'c' instead of 's'.

1086
01:23:17,557 --> 01:23:20,066
Yes, it looks strange, but that's
how it is.  Page 11 all okay.

1087
01:23:20,690 --> 01:23:25,167
Page 12, eighth, no, ninth line:

1088
01:23:25,468 --> 01:23:27,943
"visual and tactile."

1089
01:25:56,647 --> 01:25:58,701
It's been more than an hour now.

1090
01:26:03,191 --> 01:26:05,314
We'll never get him back.

1091
01:26:57,649 --> 01:26:58,923
His pulse is weak.

1092
01:27:00,331 --> 01:27:02,224
He's lost
a lot of blood.

1093
01:27:05,712 --> 01:27:07,520
Can we move him?

1094
01:27:07,842 --> 01:27:09,948
Call the hospital, quick.

1095
01:27:16,660 --> 01:27:18,433
We'll have to check
all our figures.
