1
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:30,563
- Worldwide, we're 
looking at approximately

2
00:00:30,563 --> 00:00:33,833
350 million people 
with diabetes.

3
00:00:33,833 --> 00:00:36,002
There's not question 
that we're in the midst

4
00:00:36,002 --> 00:00:38,104
of a diabetes epidemic.

5
00:00:38,104 --> 00:00:41,307
Right now, one in 
three Medicare dollars

6
00:00:41,307 --> 00:00:44,444
is spent in the care of 
people with diabetes.

7
00:00:44,444 --> 00:00:47,347
One in 10 total 
health care dollars

8
00:00:47,347 --> 00:00:50,216
is spent on people 
with diabetes.

9
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:53,920
There's no question that 
this is a major problem.

10
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,155
- [Kip] What in particular

11
00:00:55,155 --> 00:00:58,425
is the relation of 
the diet and diabetes?

12
00:00:58,425 --> 00:01:00,326
- I'm not gonna get into that.

13
00:01:00,326 --> 00:01:01,094
- [Kip] Into diet?

14
00:01:01,094 --> 00:01:02,495
- No.

15
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:26,519
- [Kip] My name is Kip, I'm a 
filmmaker from San Francisco

16
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:28,121
and I have a confession to make.

17
00:01:28,121 --> 00:01:29,989
I'm a recovering hypochondriac.

18
00:01:29,989 --> 00:01:32,859
Like so many of us, I've a 
family history of diabetes,

19
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:34,894
heart disease, and cancer.

20
00:01:34,894 --> 00:01:37,130
My dad had his 
heart bypass at 49,

21
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:38,865
the second at the age 50.

22
00:01:38,865 --> 00:01:41,334
My grandpa died young from 
diabetes complications

23
00:01:41,334 --> 00:01:44,704
and both my other grandpa 
and grandma died of cancer.

24
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:46,439
I was always paranoid 
that I would also get

25
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:47,974
one of these diseases.

26
00:01:47,974 --> 00:01:50,810
Like any good hypochondriac, 
WebMD Symptoms Checker

27
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:53,146
was essentially my 
browser's homepage.

28
00:01:53,146 --> 00:01:55,348
Even in my teens, I 
took Metamucil everyday

29
00:01:55,348 --> 00:01:56,783
and a daily aspirin.

30
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:58,785
I read all the latest 
self-diagnosis books.

31
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:01,120
I ate every multivitamin 
I can get my hands on

32
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,523
and I was obsessed 
with bodily functions.

33
00:02:03,523 --> 00:02:05,525
I followed all the large 
health organization's

34
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:07,927
recommendations for 
preventing disease.

35
00:02:07,927 --> 00:02:10,997
I exercise regularly, don't 
smoke, don't drink soda,

36
00:02:10,997 --> 00:02:12,999
get enough sleep, reduce stress,

37
00:02:12,999 --> 00:02:14,300
and grew up eating 
what I thought

38
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,703
was a healthy diet, until--

39
00:02:16,703 --> 00:02:18,171
- World Health 
Organization this morning

40
00:02:18,171 --> 00:02:21,407
has classified processed meats 
such as bacon and sausage

41
00:02:21,407 --> 00:02:23,877
as carcinogenic, 
directly involved

42
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:26,412
in causing cancer in humans.

43
00:02:26,412 --> 00:02:29,115
- [Announcer] Processed 
meat is clearly linked

44
00:02:29,115 --> 00:02:30,483
to an increase in cancer.

45
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:32,085
- Hotdogs or bacon could be just

46
00:02:32,085 --> 00:02:34,754
as dangerous as 
smoking cigarettes.

47
00:02:34,754 --> 00:02:36,422
- [Kip] The World Health 
Organization that looked

48
00:02:36,422 --> 00:02:39,726
over 800 studies from 
10 different countries

49
00:02:39,726 --> 00:02:43,296
finding a direct link 
to consuming processed 
meat in cancer.

50
00:02:43,296 --> 00:02:45,832
Just one serving of deli 
meats daily increases

51
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:49,969
your risks of colorectal 
cancer by 18%.

52
00:02:49,969 --> 00:02:53,139
I had no idea that what we 
ate affected cancer rates,

53
00:02:53,139 --> 00:02:55,542
but I never felt like I'd 
eaten a lot of processed meats

54
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:57,544
until I realized 
that processed meat

55
00:02:57,544 --> 00:02:59,746
includes hotdogs, 
bacon, sausage,

56
00:02:59,746 --> 00:03:03,216
salami, ham, pepperoni, 
cold cuts, and Deli Slices,

57
00:03:03,216 --> 00:03:05,552
basically, everything 
I grew up eating.

58
00:03:05,552 --> 00:03:07,820
The World Health Organization 
classifies processed meat

59
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:10,323
as a Group 1 carcinogen.

60
00:03:10,323 --> 00:03:14,894
The same group as cigarettes, 
asbestos, and plutonium.

61
00:03:14,894 --> 00:03:18,064
And classifies red meat 
as a Group 2 carcinogen.

62
00:03:18,064 --> 00:03:19,866
Was this like I'd 
essentially been smoking

63
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,534
my entire childhood?

64
00:03:22,902 --> 00:03:25,071
If processed meats are labeled 
the same as cigarettes,

65
00:03:25,071 --> 00:03:28,675
how is even legal for kids 
to be eating this way?

66
00:03:28,675 --> 00:03:30,610
I thought this was 
new information

67
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:35,148
but many of these studies 
had been around for 50 years.

68
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:37,417
I couldn't believe I'd 
been eating processed meats

69
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:40,420
virtually my entire 
life and was just now,

70
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:43,089
finding out how 
dangerous they are.

71
00:03:43,089 --> 00:03:44,324
Why hadn't I been 
hearing about it

72
00:03:44,324 --> 00:03:46,092
from the American 
Cancer Society,

73
00:03:46,092 --> 00:03:48,628
the largest cancer 
group in the nation?

74
00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:50,163
When I went on their website,

75
00:03:50,163 --> 00:03:51,898
I was shocked to see that 
none of these information

76
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:53,766
was featured on their homepage.

77
00:03:53,766 --> 00:03:57,103
But even more shocking, 
on their Eat Healthy page,

78
00:03:57,103 --> 00:04:00,873
they actually encouraged eating 
Group 1 carcinogenic foods

79
00:04:00,873 --> 00:04:03,009
like processed turkey 
and canned meats.

80
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:05,078
This is after the World 
Health Organization

81
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:08,081
reviewed over 800 
studies definitively

82
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:10,183
linking processed 
meat to cancer.

83
00:04:10,183 --> 00:04:12,218
- [Sam] Thank you for calling, 
American Cancer Society.

84
00:04:12,218 --> 00:04:14,954
My name is Sam, I'm a cancer 
information specialist.

85
00:04:14,954 --> 00:04:16,356
How may I help you today?

86
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:17,757
- Hi, I was calling 
because I was wondering why

87
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:18,925
you all recommend people

88
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:22,362
to eat processed 
meat on your website?

89
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:24,230
Which the World Health 
Organization has classified

90
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:26,232
as a Group 1 carcinogen?

91
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,569
Which is in the same 
class as tobacco smoking,

92
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:31,571
asbestos, and plutonium?

93
00:04:33,473 --> 00:04:35,942
This would be like a 
lung association having a

94
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:39,579
How to Roll your own Cigarettes 
section on their website.

95
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:41,948
It's kinda the same thing?

96
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:42,882
- [Sam] Well, let 
me just place you

97
00:04:42,882 --> 00:04:45,151
on a brief hold because--

98
00:04:45,151 --> 00:04:46,786
- He wasn't able to 
answer my questions

99
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:49,389
and said someone would 
get back with me.

100
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:50,990
I had always been 
concerned about cancer

101
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:54,460
because both my grandma 
and grandpa died of cancer.

102
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,928
I wondered if things 
would have been different

103
00:04:55,928 --> 00:04:57,597
had they known the 
link between diet

104
00:04:57,597 --> 00:04:59,298
and this terrible disease.

105
00:04:59,298 --> 00:05:03,403
In the US, one out of every 
four deaths is from cancer.

106
00:05:04,604 --> 00:05:06,072
Oh sweet, American 
Cancer Society rep

107
00:05:06,072 --> 00:05:08,908
confirmed the 
interview this week.

108
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:11,944
So, we just went in 
for the interview

109
00:05:11,944 --> 00:05:13,880
with the American 
Cancer Society rep

110
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,281
and the security guard said,

111
00:05:15,281 --> 00:05:17,283
"There's no 
interview scheduled."

112
00:05:17,283 --> 00:05:20,186
So I went on to my phone 
and it turns out last night,

113
00:05:20,186 --> 00:05:21,921
after I'd told her that 
the interview's gonna be

114
00:05:21,921 --> 00:05:24,924
about the correlation 
between diet and cancer,

115
00:05:24,924 --> 00:05:28,594
she said she can no 
longer do the interview.

116
00:05:29,762 --> 00:05:31,297
After repeated emails asking why

117
00:05:31,297 --> 00:05:33,099
she was declining my interviews

118
00:05:33,099 --> 00:05:35,568
to simply talk about 
diet and cancer,

119
00:05:35,568 --> 00:05:38,371
she stopped responding 
all together.

120
00:05:38,371 --> 00:05:40,873
Why would an American 
Cancer Society rep

121
00:05:40,873 --> 00:05:43,409
not wanna talk about this?

122
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:45,478
I was, however, able to 
connect with a growing movement

123
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:47,580
of doctors who are willing 
to talk about the link

124
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,816
between the standard 
American diet and disease,

125
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:51,984
and it goes beyond just cancer.

126
00:05:51,984 --> 00:05:53,953
I took my old trustee 
van, Super Blue,

127
00:05:53,953 --> 00:05:56,089
once again out on the road.

128
00:05:56,089 --> 00:05:58,424
- 2/3 of adults are now 
overweight or obese,

129
00:05:58,424 --> 00:06:01,427
and we have an epidemic 
cascade of debilitating disease

130
00:06:01,427 --> 00:06:02,962
that's overcoming the country.

131
00:06:02,962 --> 00:06:05,698
There's no way we can 
sustain the current style

132
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:09,102
of care with the epidemic 
that we're creating

133
00:06:09,102 --> 00:06:10,970
with our diet and 
lifestyle choices.

134
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:13,573
- The diabetes, the 
arthritis, the heart disease,

135
00:06:13,573 --> 00:06:16,375
the dementia, the 
obesity, the cancers

136
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:18,978
are affecting about 
70% of deaths.

137
00:06:18,978 --> 00:06:22,949
All the data is that those 
70% of deaths and morbidity

138
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:25,685
are largely lifestyle-related 
and preventable.

139
00:06:25,685 --> 00:06:30,389
- Most kids by age 10 in the 
US already have fatty streaks

140
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:32,825
in their arteries the first 
stage of atherosclerosis

141
00:06:32,825 --> 00:06:35,361
leading to heart 
attacks, strokes.

142
00:06:35,361 --> 00:06:36,596
- Here in American medicine,

143
00:06:36,596 --> 00:06:39,031
we operate from 
the disease model.

144
00:06:39,031 --> 00:06:42,201
We are in the business 
of treating sick people.

145
00:06:42,201 --> 00:06:44,270
We are not in the 
business of trying

146
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:46,105
to prevent people 
from becoming sick.

147
00:06:46,105 --> 00:06:48,074
- When you look at 
chronic disease risk,

148
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:50,009
all the things that we 
walk around worrying about.

149
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:53,246
Actually, dietary 
choices trump smoking

150
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:54,914
when it comes to those risks.

151
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:57,817
- If I could deliver one 
message to the researchers

152
00:06:57,817 --> 00:07:00,319
who are looking for 
the cause of diabetes

153
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:01,988
and the cause of 
clogged arteries,

154
00:07:01,988 --> 00:07:03,723
and the cause of 
high blood pressure,

155
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:06,125
and the cause of obesity, 
I would tell them,

156
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:09,428
the answer's in three words, 
it's the food.

157
00:07:09,428 --> 00:07:11,464
It's what Americans are eating.

158
00:07:11,464 --> 00:07:13,966
- [Kip] Today, with 2/3 of 
Americans being overweight,

159
00:07:13,966 --> 00:07:16,602
clearly, there's a food issue.

160
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:18,004
In the next 25 years,

161
00:07:18,004 --> 00:07:21,607
one out of every three 
Americans will have diabetes.

162
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:23,509
- My name's Michael Abdalla.

163
00:07:23,509 --> 00:07:26,746
I'm from Atlanta, Georgia, 
and unfortunately,

164
00:07:26,746 --> 00:07:29,949
I was diagnosed about 10 
years ago with diabetes,

165
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:33,319
and eight years ago, I 
had two stents put in.

166
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:35,588
I don't know where to 
go, I don't know what do,

167
00:07:35,588 --> 00:07:38,391
you just like add the options 
and you don't know what to do.

168
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:40,426
You take in medicine, you 
listen to this doctor,

169
00:07:40,426 --> 00:07:42,995
and the cardiologist 
says, "Take this,"

170
00:07:42,995 --> 00:07:46,299
and the endocrinologist 
says, "Take that,"

171
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:48,367
then your general 
practitioner doctor says,

172
00:07:48,367 --> 00:07:49,969
"You don't know 
what's going on here."

173
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:52,371
It's a real challenging thing

174
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:57,443
and it's something that 
you don't wanna get.

175
00:07:57,443 --> 00:07:58,911
You just don't wanna get it.

176
00:07:58,911 --> 00:08:01,080
- [Kip] Government and media 
almost exclusively blame

177
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:04,884
lack of exercise and sugary 
foods as a cause of diabetes.

178
00:08:04,884 --> 00:08:06,552
But I wanted to talk 
with an actual expert

179
00:08:06,552 --> 00:08:08,688
on the role of diet in diabetes.

180
00:08:08,688 --> 00:08:10,056
I went to speak with 
premier physician,

181
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:13,793
diabetes expert, and 
researcher, Dr. Neal Barnard.

182
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:17,396
What role does sugar 
play in causing diabetes?

183
00:08:17,396 --> 00:08:18,598
- Drive me crazy.

184
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:21,000
Diabetes is not and 
never was caused

185
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,836
by eating a high 
carbohydrate diet

186
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:25,371
and it's not caused 
by eating sugar.

187
00:08:25,371 --> 00:08:27,306
The cause of diabetes is a diet

188
00:08:27,306 --> 00:08:29,876
that builds up the amount 
of fat into the blood.

189
00:08:29,876 --> 00:08:33,145
I'm talking about a typical 
meat-based, animal-based diet.

190
00:08:33,145 --> 00:08:35,581
You can look into the muscle 
cells of the human body

191
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:38,084
and you find they're building 
up tiny particles of fat

192
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:40,386
which is causing 
insulin resistance.

193
00:08:40,386 --> 00:08:42,221
What that means is the sugar

194
00:08:42,221 --> 00:08:44,457
that is naturally from the 
foods that you're eating

195
00:08:44,457 --> 00:08:46,525
can't get into the 
cells where it belongs.

196
00:08:46,525 --> 00:08:49,095
It builds up in the blood 
and that's diabetes.

197
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:50,329
- [Kip] I had never 
heard that meat

198
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:52,164
was associated with 
causing diabetes.

199
00:08:52,164 --> 00:08:54,934
We had always been told that 
sugar and obesity caused it.

200
00:08:54,934 --> 00:08:56,402
Renowned weight loss 
bariatric surgeon,

201
00:08:56,402 --> 00:08:58,538
Dr. Garth Davis, though agreed.

202
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,439
- Everyone thinks that you 
diabetic because of carbs,

203
00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:03,676
did a huge study and that 
epic study, 500,000 people.

204
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:06,512
Carbs consumption was 
inversely related to diabetes.

205
00:09:06,512 --> 00:09:08,481
In other words, the more 
carbs they wanna to eat,

206
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:12,351
the less diabetes they had but 
meat was strongly correlated.

207
00:09:12,351 --> 00:09:13,619
Get that aha moment.

208
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:15,855
The starches, the 
carbs are good for you.

209
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:17,323
They're not bad for you.

210
00:09:17,323 --> 00:09:20,459
This idea that carbs make you 
fat is utterly ridiculous.

211
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:23,629
Carbs cannot make you 
fat in and of themselves.

212
00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:26,065
We have storage in our muscles

213
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:28,301
and in our liver for 
carbs called glycogen.

214
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:31,137
So, when we eat carbs, we 
either store it or we burn it.

215
00:09:31,137 --> 00:09:33,606
Now, eat fat that goes 
straight to you fat.

216
00:09:33,606 --> 00:09:36,375
Your body can't turn 
those carbs into fat

217
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:38,577
unless you're really 
overdoing your calories.

218
00:09:38,577 --> 00:09:40,313
Basically, it's 
a death sentence.

219
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:42,248
You're at much higher 
risk of getting cancer.

220
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:44,483
You're almost certainly 
gonna get diabetes.

221
00:09:44,483 --> 00:09:45,985
No one wants to fat shame

222
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:47,753
and we all want everybody to 
be comfortable with our bodies

223
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:49,422
but this movement to be 
comfortable with our bodies

224
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:51,324
has made us comfortable 
with being sick

225
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:52,892
and that's a huge problem.

226
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:54,627
I go into the hospital 
and I look around me,

227
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:56,963
people on dialysis, 
all these sick people

228
00:09:56,963 --> 00:09:58,631
and just about every 
disease in there

229
00:09:58,631 --> 00:10:00,433
is because of what 
people are eating.

230
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:03,669
- Here's the thing, if 
I eat a sugary cookie,

231
00:10:03,669 --> 00:10:06,038
the sugar lures you in 
like the Trojan Horse

232
00:10:06,038 --> 00:10:07,873
but waiting inside that cookie

233
00:10:07,873 --> 00:10:10,476
is a huge load of 
butter or shortening

234
00:10:10,476 --> 00:10:11,711
and that's what fattens you up.

235
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:13,679
That's the part that 
leads to the diabetes.

236
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:15,848
It's the fatty foods, not 
really so much the sugar.

237
00:10:15,848 --> 00:10:17,350
- It's not that 
sugar's good for you.

238
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:19,652
There's no nutrients in 
it, it's excess calories,

239
00:10:19,652 --> 00:10:20,786
but when you eat sugar,

240
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:22,655
you don't get 
inflammation right away.

241
00:10:22,655 --> 00:10:24,623
When you eat sugar, 
you're not getting plaques

242
00:10:24,623 --> 00:10:26,125
forming in your vessels.

243
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,027
When you're eating sugar, 
your body's gonna store

244
00:10:28,027 --> 00:10:31,697
most of it as glycogen 
or burn it as calories.

245
00:10:31,697 --> 00:10:35,568
So, this focus on sugar 
has taken all the focus off

246
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:39,772
meat, dairy, eggs, 
pork, turkey, chicken.

247
00:10:39,772 --> 00:10:41,574
- People need to understand.

248
00:10:41,574 --> 00:10:43,476
If their gets diabetes,

249
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:46,912
you've just take 19 years 
off their life span.

250
00:10:46,912 --> 00:10:48,948
We're talking life and death.

251
00:10:48,948 --> 00:10:50,416
- I realized, there 
was so much more

252
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:52,852
about diet and disease 
that I hadn't ever learned.

253
00:10:52,852 --> 00:10:54,286
It felt as if this information

254
00:10:54,286 --> 00:10:56,022
had been practically withheld.

255
00:10:56,022 --> 00:10:57,857
Processed meat causes cancer.

256
00:10:57,857 --> 00:11:00,259
Sugar doesn't cause diabetes.

257
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:02,428
I had doubt about the claims 
these doctors are making

258
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:04,764
so I did some 
searching on my own.

259
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:06,899
Harvard researchers looked 
at nine perspective studies

260
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:09,668
finding that just one serving 
of processed meat per day

261
00:11:09,668 --> 00:11:13,839
increased risk of 
developing diabetes by 51%.

262
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,074
The link between eating meat

263
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:17,977
and developing diabetes 
became undeniable.

264
00:11:17,977 --> 00:11:19,178
But when I went on

265
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:20,946
the leading diabetes 
organization's website,

266
00:11:20,946 --> 00:11:22,915
the American 
Diabetes Association,

267
00:11:22,915 --> 00:11:24,583
not only did they not 
have this information

268
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:27,386
front and center, they 
were featuring recipes

269
00:11:27,386 --> 00:11:30,056
for red and processed 
meat and on there,

270
00:11:30,056 --> 00:11:31,991
Recipes for Healthy Living.

271
00:11:31,991 --> 00:11:34,193
They had bacon wrapped shrimp?

272
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:36,328
What the health?

273
00:11:36,328 --> 00:11:38,564
All right, send an email to 
American Diabetes Association,

274
00:11:38,564 --> 00:11:40,633
see if they get back to us.

275
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:42,401
As destructive as diabetes is,

276
00:11:42,401 --> 00:11:44,336
it pales in comparison 
to heart disease.

277
00:11:44,336 --> 00:11:47,139
Over 17 million 
people die every year

278
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:49,141
from cardiovascular disease.

279
00:11:49,141 --> 00:11:51,644
It is the leading cause 
of death around the world.

280
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:54,146
Nearly, one out of 
every three people

281
00:11:54,146 --> 00:11:56,115
will die from this disease.

282
00:11:56,115 --> 00:11:58,584
The amount of people who die 
from cardiovascular disease

283
00:11:58,584 --> 00:12:01,020
is the equivalent 
of four jumbo jets

284
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:03,222
crashing every single hour

285
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:06,225
every single day, 
every single year.

286
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:12,064
- My name is Amy Resnic,

287
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:14,333
and I'm from Swampscott, 
Massachusetts,

288
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:16,102
little bit north of Boston.

289
00:12:16,102 --> 00:12:19,772
And I recently went to 
my doctor for asthma

290
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:21,907
because I had a very 
hard time breathing

291
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:24,810
and while there, she 
did some blood work

292
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:28,414
and one of the tests 
was C-reactive protein

293
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:33,986
and that was a scale 
of one to three.

294
00:12:33,986 --> 00:12:36,188
One being low for cardiac event,

295
00:12:36,188 --> 00:12:38,190
three being high 
for a cardiac event,

296
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:40,192
and my number was 10.82.

297
00:12:41,627 --> 00:12:42,862
- What does that means.

298
00:12:42,862 --> 00:12:45,164
- That means I am on the 
road for heart attack

299
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:48,467
and she said, "Probably, 
within the next 30 days."

300
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:50,302
- 30 days? 
- 30 days,

301
00:12:50,302 --> 00:12:52,404
if I'm going the 
way I was going.

302
00:12:52,404 --> 00:12:55,407
I take this for my 
heart arrhythmia,

303
00:12:57,109 --> 00:13:00,346
take this for pain, 
oxycodone for pain,

304
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:03,716
and lorazepam for stress,

305
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:07,853
cyclobenzaprine 
for muscle relaxer.

306
00:13:07,853 --> 00:13:10,489
Also take Topamax and Prozac

307
00:13:10,489 --> 00:13:13,959
and I also use a CPAP 
machine to help me breathe,

308
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:18,330
and my asthma has been 
so bad this past year.

309
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:22,268
I used to turn the day 
as well to get some air.

310
00:13:22,268 --> 00:13:26,338
I am tired when I wake up, 
I'm tired during the day.

311
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:30,609
I take a nap, I'm so 
tired, I can't breathe,

312
00:13:30,609 --> 00:13:34,780
and I know I need to make 
at change for my health,

313
00:13:36,448 --> 00:13:39,952
I also am not gonna 
be here for my family.

314
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,388
- When we speak 
of heart disease,

315
00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:44,757
I would say the role of 
alcohol is pretty small.

316
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:47,526
The role of sugar 
is very small too.

317
00:13:47,526 --> 00:13:49,461
Smoking is big, 
but the good news

318
00:13:49,461 --> 00:13:52,331
is that most people have 
quit or never did smoke.

319
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:54,099
The problem with 
animal-based diet,

320
00:13:54,099 --> 00:13:56,368
it's contribution to 
heart disease is huge,

321
00:13:56,368 --> 00:13:57,670
and it is pervasive.

322
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:01,106
- All these expensive 
imaging, procedures,

323
00:14:02,441 --> 00:14:04,176
bypasses, medication,

324
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:09,682
none of which has one 
solitary single thing to do

325
00:14:10,883 --> 00:14:12,484
with the causation 
of the illness

326
00:14:12,484 --> 00:14:14,253
so you die with a 
completely benign,

327
00:14:14,253 --> 00:14:15,521
full-blown illness,

328
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:17,523
that never had its 
causation treated.

329
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:21,060
- When we eat these kind of 
dead meat bacteria toxins,

330
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,362
within minutes, 
we get this burst

331
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:25,598
of inflammation 
within your system

332
00:14:25,598 --> 00:14:27,733
such that you basically 
paralyze your arteries.

333
00:14:27,733 --> 00:14:29,134
So, you get this 
stiffening of the arteries,

334
00:14:29,134 --> 00:14:32,238
their inability to 
relax normally in half.

335
00:14:32,238 --> 00:14:35,140
It's not like decades down 
the road, eating unhealthy,

336
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,408
there'll be some damage, no.

337
00:14:36,408 --> 00:14:38,110
We're talking damage 
right then and there

338
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:40,246
within minutes of 
going into our mouth.

339
00:14:40,246 --> 00:14:44,617
- Many people are given the 
diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease

340
00:14:44,617 --> 00:14:47,253
when it's not true 
Alzheimer's at all.

341
00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:49,121
The vast majority of 
people suffered dementia

342
00:14:49,121 --> 00:14:51,023
through that their 
tiny blood vessels

343
00:14:51,023 --> 00:14:54,326
in their brain clogging 
up and their nerve cells

344
00:14:54,326 --> 00:14:56,462
being short-changed 
of oxygenated blood

345
00:14:56,462 --> 00:14:58,697
and guess where their blood 
vessel eventually comes from,

346
00:14:58,697 --> 00:15:00,699
those little tiny 
arteries are clogging up

347
00:15:00,699 --> 00:15:03,602
from that steady stream of 
fat, cholesterol, et cetera.

348
00:15:03,602 --> 00:15:06,205
- It's really quite clear 
from the standpoint of cancer

349
00:15:06,205 --> 00:15:08,507
and the standpoint of 
cardiovascular disease,

350
00:15:08,507 --> 00:15:11,243
that animal protein 
plays an enormous role.

351
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:13,912
- [Kip] Is chicken better?

352
00:15:13,912 --> 00:15:16,282
- It's question of whether 
you be shot or hung.

353
00:15:16,282 --> 00:15:18,250
- The flesh food that 
I would eliminate

354
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,519
from the American 
diet would be poultry,

355
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:22,087
would be turkey and chicken.

356
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:23,989
Their brilliant 
advertising campaign

357
00:15:23,989 --> 00:15:25,257
has convinced people that,

358
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:27,192
"Oh, it's white meat, 
it's healthier."

359
00:15:27,192 --> 00:15:29,528
- The leading source of sodium

360
00:15:29,528 --> 00:15:33,399
in the American diet 
for adult is chicken.

361
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:35,000
It can be labeled 
all-natural chicken

362
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,735
but they inject it 
with a salt water,

363
00:15:36,735 --> 00:15:38,904
I think, up to 800 
milligrams of sodium.

364
00:15:38,904 --> 00:15:41,240
- Heterocyclic amines 
are clear cut carcinogens

365
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,609
and they can form 
in any kind of meat

366
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:45,444
as it's heated, as it's cooked,

367
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:48,881
but by far, the biggest 
source is chicken.

368
00:15:48,881 --> 00:15:52,751
We sent researchers into fast 
food and family restaurants.

369
00:15:52,751 --> 00:15:56,055
Not only were there carcinogens 
in every single restaurant.

370
00:15:56,055 --> 00:15:58,924
Well, we found them in 
every single chicken sample

371
00:15:58,924 --> 00:15:59,858
that we took.

372
00:15:59,858 --> 00:16:01,226
If somebody brings their family

373
00:16:01,226 --> 00:16:03,128
and then they're buying 
a bucket of chicken,

374
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:04,997
nobody tells them that 
there are carcinogens.

375
00:16:04,997 --> 00:16:07,599
If you're selling 
carcinogens to people,

376
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:09,702
you've gotta warn them 
that they're in there.

377
00:16:09,702 --> 00:16:11,670
- [Kip] But the American Cancer 
Society encourages people

378
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:14,406
to switch from red and 
processed meat to chicken.

379
00:16:14,406 --> 00:16:16,342
Why would the American 
Cancer Society tell people

380
00:16:16,342 --> 00:16:19,178
to switch from eating one 
carcinogenic food to another

381
00:16:19,178 --> 00:16:20,479
when a Harvard University study

382
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,114
showed that men 
with prostate cancer

383
00:16:22,114 --> 00:16:23,615
who eat large amounts of chicken

384
00:16:23,615 --> 00:16:27,086
increased their risk of the 
disease progressing four times?

385
00:16:27,086 --> 00:16:30,222
- The number one dietary source 
in America of cholesterol

386
00:16:30,222 --> 00:16:32,057
is chicken because 
the volume of chicken.

387
00:16:32,057 --> 00:16:35,194
Chickens become grilled 
chicken and organic chicken,

388
00:16:35,194 --> 00:16:37,863
if it's machismo, 
but it has nearly

389
00:16:37,863 --> 00:16:40,165
as much cholesterol 
per gram as red beef

390
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:42,668
suggests that sheer volume 
is the number one source

391
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:44,336
yet eggs being close by.

392
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:46,205
- [Kip] I'd never really 
thought about eggs much.

393
00:16:46,205 --> 00:16:47,439
I just thought of them

394
00:16:47,439 --> 00:16:49,208
as a standard part 
of the healthy diet.

395
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:50,709
But then, I found 
a study suggesting

396
00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:53,145
that eating just one 
egg a day can be as bad

397
00:16:53,145 --> 00:16:57,249
as smoking five cigarettes 
per day for life expectancy.

398
00:16:57,249 --> 00:17:00,619
- The yolk of a hen's egg is 
the most concentrated glom

399
00:17:00,619 --> 00:17:03,055
of saturated fat 
and cholesterol.

400
00:17:03,055 --> 00:17:05,858
It is made to run a 
baby chicken for 21 days

401
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:07,726
with no outside energy.

402
00:17:07,726 --> 00:17:09,328
It is pure fat and cholesterol.

403
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:11,964
And when we put that 
into our blood stream,

404
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:13,232
it coats our red blood cells,

405
00:17:13,232 --> 00:17:15,634
our blood gets thicker 
and more viscous.

406
00:17:15,634 --> 00:17:17,136
It changes our hormone levels.

407
00:17:17,136 --> 00:17:18,737
It raises our 
cholesterol levels.

408
00:17:18,737 --> 00:17:21,840
There's nothing healthy 
about eating yolk of the egg.

409
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,308
- [Kip] But I thought 
cholesterol and saturated fat

410
00:17:23,308 --> 00:17:25,477
wasn't an issue anymore?

411
00:17:25,477 --> 00:17:27,379
- You know, these saturated 
fat studies that have come out,

412
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:29,214
trying to vindicate 
saturated fat.

413
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:30,916
That's a campaign by 
the dairy industry.

414
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:34,486
Number one source of saturated 
fat is dairy, it's not meat.

415
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:37,222
2008, the global dairy industry 
got together at a meeting

416
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:39,558
and explicitly read their agenda

417
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:43,195
was to neutralize the 
negative impact of milk fat

418
00:17:43,195 --> 00:17:45,864
by regulators and medical 
professionals, unquote.

419
00:17:45,864 --> 00:17:47,533
So, what they do, 
they funded studies.

420
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:48,734
- [Kip] The main 
study that started

421
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:50,669
the whole saturated 
fat media craze

422
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:53,372
was funded by the 
National Dairy Council.

423
00:17:53,372 --> 00:17:55,441
The egg industry 
similarly fund studies

424
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:57,342
that confuse consumers 
by making claims

425
00:17:57,342 --> 00:17:59,745
that eggs don't negatively 
affect heart function.

426
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:01,447
That is only when 
compared to eating

427
00:18:01,447 --> 00:18:04,116
a McDonald's Sausage McMuffin?

428
00:18:04,116 --> 00:18:05,584
So, what they're 
really saying is that

429
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:08,620
eating eggs is just as 
bad as eating a McMuffin.

430
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:10,923
- When you eat foods 
like beef or steak

431
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,958
or a processed meat, a hotdog,

432
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:14,326
you're not just 
getting saturated fat,

433
00:18:14,326 --> 00:18:17,029
you're also getting 
other additional toxins

434
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:18,464
that are in that food.

435
00:18:18,464 --> 00:18:20,732
There's heme iron, carcinogens, 
and processing chemicals.

436
00:18:20,732 --> 00:18:22,601
This is all a lot 
more complicated

437
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:24,770
than just looking 
at saturated fat.

438
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:28,674
- The strategy is not on making 
their products any safer.

439
00:18:28,674 --> 00:18:31,910
The strategy is to just 
try to confuse the public

440
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:33,579
to introduce doubt.

441
00:18:33,579 --> 00:18:35,547
You know, there was a famous 
tobacco industry memo.

442
00:18:35,547 --> 00:18:37,549
It's called, Doubt 
is our product.

443
00:18:37,549 --> 00:18:38,817
That's all they had to do.

444
00:18:38,817 --> 00:18:40,486
They didn't have to 
convince the Americans

445
00:18:40,486 --> 00:18:42,554
that smoking was healthy, right?

446
00:18:42,554 --> 00:18:46,225
They just had to introduce 
doubt then they would win.

447
00:18:46,225 --> 00:18:47,926
Well, if there's just 
enough controversy,

448
00:18:47,926 --> 00:18:49,461
people kinda throw 
up their hands,

449
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:50,496
"I don't know what to eat."

450
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:52,498
Confusion is their gain.

451
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:55,767
I really don't think people 
thought what they ate

452
00:18:55,767 --> 00:18:57,236
led to heart disease.

453
00:18:57,236 --> 00:18:59,171
They think. "Oh, it's 
genetic, my parents had it."

454
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:01,006
I don't think 
people really think

455
00:19:01,006 --> 00:19:02,541
that what they ate 
lead to diabetes.

456
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:04,543
They think, "Oh, my parents 
had it, I was gonna get it."

457
00:19:04,543 --> 00:19:06,478
And certainly, cancer, 
they don't think that way.

458
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:09,314
- People have bad lifestyles 
that they've inherited.

459
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:10,916
Environmentally, 
they've been exposed

460
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:12,518
to a certain way of 
eating and living

461
00:19:12,518 --> 00:19:14,720
they've carried on 
into their adulthood,

462
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,255
passed on to their children.

463
00:19:16,255 --> 00:19:19,858
That is why they go on to 
develop the same diseases

464
00:19:19,858 --> 00:19:22,661
that their parents 
and grandparents may 
have had before them

465
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:24,229
but it is not inevitable.

466
00:19:24,229 --> 00:19:25,998
- Even if you have a 
genetic predisposition,

467
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:28,700
it doesn't mean it's going 
to necessarily manifest.

468
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,435
What determines whether 
it manifests or not,

469
00:19:30,435 --> 00:19:32,104
maybe those 
epigenetic variables,

470
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:33,539
the things that you can control.

471
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:35,407
The environmental factors, 
the dietary factors,

472
00:19:35,407 --> 00:19:36,875
the lifestyle factors.

473
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:39,444
- So, we can actually change 
the expression of genes.

474
00:19:39,444 --> 00:19:41,847
Tumor-suppressing genes, 
tumor activating genes

475
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:45,117
by what we eat, what 
we put into our bodies.

476
00:19:45,117 --> 00:19:49,488
So, even if you've been 
dealt a bad genetic deck,

477
00:19:49,488 --> 00:19:52,424
you can still 
reshuffle it with diet.

478
00:19:52,424 --> 00:19:53,892
- I'd always thought

479
00:19:53,892 --> 00:19:55,394
that I would develop heart 
disease at a young age

480
00:19:55,394 --> 00:19:57,362
because both my dad and 
grandpa had heart attacks.

481
00:19:57,362 --> 00:19:59,164
I was taught that 
they were genetic,

482
00:19:59,164 --> 00:20:01,266
but the heart attacks probably 
had less to do with genes

483
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:03,669
and more to do with 
their diets high in meat.

484
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:06,104
That's why when I went on the 
American Heart Association's

485
00:20:06,104 --> 00:20:09,341
Heart-healthy Recipes 
page, I could not believe

486
00:20:09,341 --> 00:20:12,611
they had an entire 
section on beef recipes?

487
00:20:12,611 --> 00:20:14,746
This was just like the 
American Cancer Society

488
00:20:14,746 --> 00:20:17,916
encouraging eating Group 1 
carcinogens on their site.

489
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:21,920
Meat loaf, pork loin, 
steak on your recipe list?

490
00:20:23,322 --> 00:20:24,856
Are you kidding me?

491
00:20:24,856 --> 00:20:27,326
It's like this menu's trying 
to get people heart attacks.

492
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:29,461
At your website, we noticed 
heart-healthy recipes,

493
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:33,632
and we're kinda bewildered by 
why there's a bunch of recipes

494
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:38,870
on the whole section 
on beef, beef recipes,

495
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:41,006
and there's also a 
section on egg recipes

496
00:20:41,006 --> 00:20:43,241
when there's such a strong link

497
00:20:43,241 --> 00:20:46,845
between beef, red meat, 
and heart disease?

498
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,550
- [Man] I honestly don't know 
'cause I don't do that ideas.

499
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:53,352
That's not what I do. 

500
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:54,920
- [Kip] Another organization 
rep that wasn't able

501
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,488
to answer my questions

502
00:20:56,488 --> 00:20:59,391
but he said that he'd have 
someone get in touch shortly.

503
00:20:59,391 --> 00:21:01,193
I was, however, able to 
talk to the president

504
00:21:01,193 --> 00:21:04,663
of the American College of 
Cardiology, Dr. Kim Williams.

505
00:21:04,663 --> 00:21:06,331
- So, the American 
College of Cardiology

506
00:21:06,331 --> 00:21:09,901
is a 47,000-member and 
growing organization

507
00:21:11,336 --> 00:21:13,639
with a a dedicated mission 
to reduce heart disease

508
00:21:13,639 --> 00:21:15,907
and to improve patients' lives.

509
00:21:15,907 --> 00:21:18,176
And if you look at the 
incidence of hypertension

510
00:21:18,176 --> 00:21:21,113
and diabetes and 
mortality in men,

511
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:24,850
they actually get reduced 
as you go higher and higher

512
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:27,686
in terms of how much you 
restrict animal products.

513
00:21:27,686 --> 00:21:28,920
- [Kip] What about fish?

514
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,622
- So, fish is a 
little different.

515
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:34,793
You've got the four worries 
which is PCBs, mercury,

516
00:21:37,295 --> 00:21:39,765
saturated fat, and cholesterol.

517
00:21:39,765 --> 00:21:42,868
And the cholesterol 
is all over the place.

518
00:21:42,868 --> 00:21:44,903
You can eat tuna in water,

519
00:21:44,903 --> 00:21:48,173
that'll be almost less 
than a glass of milk

520
00:21:48,173 --> 00:21:52,911
to salmon or tilapia which 
is higher than a pork chop.

521
00:21:52,911 --> 00:21:54,846
- If you look 
objectively at fish,

522
00:21:54,846 --> 00:21:58,116
what you find is they become 
essentially mercury sponges.

523
00:21:58,116 --> 00:21:59,418
And that's why in many 
parts of the country,

524
00:21:59,418 --> 00:22:01,420
they warn you, "Don't 
have more than so many

525
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:02,821
"of these fish a week

526
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:04,156
"because it's getting 
too much mercury.

527
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:05,090
"It can kill you."

528
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:06,825
- Fish are eaten by bigger fish

529
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:08,694
who are eaten by a bigger 
fish and these pesticides

530
00:22:08,694 --> 00:22:12,164
or herbicides bioaccumulate 
in the fish flesh.

531
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:13,932
And the big fish 
including the salmon

532
00:22:13,932 --> 00:22:15,734
which people think 
is a healthiest fish.

533
00:22:15,734 --> 00:22:18,236
Truth is the amount of 
pesticides and herbicides

534
00:22:18,236 --> 00:22:20,772
in the flesh of these 
fish are shocking

535
00:22:20,772 --> 00:22:22,040
and they have estrogenic

536
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,643
and cancer promoting 
properties in them.

537
00:22:24,643 --> 00:22:26,244
- They'll say, "Well, 
but don't sardines

538
00:22:26,244 --> 00:22:29,047
"have less concentration 
of toxic waste products

539
00:22:29,047 --> 00:22:30,549
"than other ones?"

540
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:33,785
Something being less toxic 
doesn't make it healthy.

541
00:22:33,785 --> 00:22:35,620
It just makes it less toxic.

542
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:38,356
- Farmed fish is by 
no means healthier.

543
00:22:38,356 --> 00:22:40,959
All the antibiotics that 
these animals have to be fed

544
00:22:40,959 --> 00:22:43,962
similar to chickens and 
turkeys kept in confinement.

545
00:22:43,962 --> 00:22:45,497
These fish get infections.

546
00:22:45,497 --> 00:22:48,033
They get fungal infections, 
they get bacterial infections,

547
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:50,368
you've gotta feed them 
antifungals, antibiotics,

548
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:54,005
and these substances accumulate 
in the fish flesh as well.

549
00:22:54,005 --> 00:22:56,108
- [Kip] I always knew that 
pollution was bad for our health

550
00:22:56,108 --> 00:22:57,542
but I never thought about

551
00:22:57,542 --> 00:22:59,344
the environmental 
pollutants affecting food.

552
00:22:59,344 --> 00:23:02,114
- Dioxins being the most 
toxic man-made chemicals

553
00:23:02,114 --> 00:23:04,216
known to science cause 
all sorts of things.

554
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:06,785
They cause endometriosis, 
they cause cancers,

555
00:23:06,785 --> 00:23:09,087
they cause endocrine 
disruption problems.

556
00:23:09,087 --> 00:23:12,657
Most of your exposure, 93% 
of it comes from eating meat

557
00:23:12,657 --> 00:23:14,392
and dairy products 
because it climbs up

558
00:23:14,392 --> 00:23:16,161
in the food chain 
so effectively.

559
00:23:16,161 --> 00:23:18,697
So, you can get exposed 
living near these incinerators

560
00:23:18,697 --> 00:23:21,399
and breathing it but 
it'll take you 14 years

561
00:23:21,399 --> 00:23:24,002
to breathe in as 
much dioxin as a cow

562
00:23:24,002 --> 00:23:26,404
ingest by eating the 
grass in one day,

563
00:23:26,404 --> 00:23:28,907
and that dioxin will 
accumulate in as fat

564
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:31,109
which includes the 
milk and the meat

565
00:23:31,109 --> 00:23:33,145
and anyone eating 
meat or dairy products

566
00:23:33,145 --> 00:23:35,514
is going to get 
that dose of dioxin

567
00:23:35,514 --> 00:23:37,682
so it climbs up the 
food chain every step.

568
00:23:37,682 --> 00:23:41,019
Men have no way in their 
bodies to get rid of dioxins

569
00:23:41,019 --> 00:23:42,921
but women have two ways.

570
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:44,823
They're both involving 
having a baby.

571
00:23:44,823 --> 00:23:47,125
One is that dioxin 
crosses the placenta

572
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:48,560
into the growing infant,

573
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:51,163
and the other is that it 
comes out from the breastmilk.

574
00:23:51,163 --> 00:23:53,265
So, if you have a meat 
and dairy consuming mother

575
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:54,833
breastfeeding that infant,

576
00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:57,903
then the highest impacts 
of toxic exposure

577
00:23:57,903 --> 00:24:00,038
like mercury and dioxins 
will give that infant.

578
00:24:00,038 --> 00:24:02,107
- Pregnant women are told 
of certain types of fish

579
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:04,009
should be avoided but what about

580
00:24:04,009 --> 00:24:07,846
all these other animal 
products which are introducing.

581
00:24:07,846 --> 00:24:09,781
Imagine as the 
fetus is developing,

582
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:12,584
introducing these 
very harmful toxins

583
00:24:12,584 --> 00:24:16,054
which create reproductive 
abnormalities,

584
00:24:16,054 --> 00:24:18,523
developmental problems 
and hormonal issues

585
00:24:18,523 --> 00:24:20,458
right as the child 
is developing,

586
00:24:20,458 --> 00:24:22,327
the most critical 
stage of development.

587
00:24:22,327 --> 00:24:24,196
- It does make you 
worry when people say,

588
00:24:24,196 --> 00:24:26,164
"Don't you wanna have 
a little bit of milk

589
00:24:26,164 --> 00:24:27,632
"because you're pregnant?

590
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:28,733
"Don't you wanna have some 
fish 'cause you're pregnant?"

591
00:24:28,733 --> 00:24:29,668
Who do you think is gonna get

592
00:24:29,668 --> 00:24:31,102
the chemicals that are in that?

593
00:24:31,102 --> 00:24:34,339
- All these environmental 
toxins and toxins from the feed

594
00:24:34,339 --> 00:24:37,042
that they're being fed 
accumulate in their tissues

595
00:24:37,042 --> 00:24:39,277
and are released into the mother

596
00:24:39,277 --> 00:24:41,213
and unfortunately, to the child

597
00:24:41,213 --> 00:24:43,682
when you eat these products 
when you're pregnant.

598
00:24:43,682 --> 00:24:47,319
So, this includes 
antibiotics, hormones,

599
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:49,654
steroids in animal feed.

600
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:53,725
Commercial animals are 
largely fed GMO corn and soy

601
00:24:53,725 --> 00:24:56,361
which are very 
laden in pesticides.

602
00:24:56,361 --> 00:24:58,697
PCBs have been 
banned since the '70s

603
00:24:58,697 --> 00:25:02,067
but they persist in the 
environment, dioxins.

604
00:25:02,067 --> 00:25:06,504
All of these compounds can 
create hormonal reproductive,

605
00:25:06,504 --> 00:25:08,740
developmental damage as well.

606
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:12,510
- Eating organic beef, 
poultry, pork or fish

607
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:15,180
will not help you avoid 
contaminants like mercury,

608
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,415
like dioxins, like strontium-90

609
00:25:17,415 --> 00:25:19,417
because they fall 
out over all sorts

610
00:25:19,417 --> 00:25:21,119
of farms fields 
and water bodies,

611
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:23,121
and they don't skip 
over the organic fields.

612
00:25:23,121 --> 00:25:25,323
So, really the 
contaminants are coming in

613
00:25:25,323 --> 00:25:28,426
regardless of how these 
animals are raised.

614
00:25:28,426 --> 00:25:29,628
- [Kip] I had always 
been concerned

615
00:25:29,628 --> 00:25:31,263
about the possible 
health impacts of GMOs

616
00:25:31,263 --> 00:25:33,698
but then found out that most 
of the world's GMO crops

617
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:35,533
are actually 
consumed by livestock

618
00:25:35,533 --> 00:25:37,903
with dairy cows consuming 
the most per animal.

619
00:25:37,903 --> 00:25:39,638
This fact with 
everything I'd learned

620
00:25:39,638 --> 00:25:42,140
about bioaccumulation 
made dairy terrifying

621
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:45,410
especially considering how 
much cheese I ate in my life.

622
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:47,979
- Cheese is an amazing product 
when you think about it.

623
00:25:47,979 --> 00:25:51,516
It's probably one of 
the single desk foods

624
00:25:51,516 --> 00:25:53,218
that compromising health

625
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:55,053
that you're gonna 
actually feed to people.

626
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:55,987
Think about it.

627
00:25:55,987 --> 00:25:57,522
You've got an animal product,

628
00:25:57,522 --> 00:26:00,425
so you've got all the issues 
of biological concentration.

629
00:26:00,425 --> 00:26:03,261
You with have a highly 
processed food product

630
00:26:03,261 --> 00:26:06,231
and not only does it have 
naturally a lot of saturated fat

631
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:07,933
but you put a lot 
of salt into it.

632
00:26:07,933 --> 00:26:09,868
- There's a strong link 
between dairy foods

633
00:26:09,868 --> 00:26:13,004
and autoimmune diseases 
so that can show itself up

634
00:26:13,004 --> 00:26:16,474
as excessive production of mucus

635
00:26:16,474 --> 00:26:18,977
and exacerbation of asthma 
and kids who are prone to that

636
00:26:18,977 --> 00:26:20,578
and even adults and also,

637
00:26:20,578 --> 00:26:21,913
there's an association 
between dairy foods

638
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:25,517
and multiple sclerosis 
and type 1 diabetes,

639
00:26:25,517 --> 00:26:27,152
which is an autoimmune disease

640
00:26:27,152 --> 00:26:29,788
and other 
rheumatological problems.

641
00:26:29,788 --> 00:26:33,491
- Cow's milk is baby 
calf growth food.

642
00:26:33,491 --> 00:26:35,627
That's what the stuff is.

643
00:26:35,627 --> 00:26:37,796
There's absolutely no 
child or human on earth

644
00:26:37,796 --> 00:26:39,798
who actually needs 
the milk of a cow

645
00:26:39,798 --> 00:26:42,734
any more than they need the 
milk of a giraffe or a mouse.

646
00:26:42,734 --> 00:26:45,904
- Most people in the world 
are lactose intolerant.

647
00:26:45,904 --> 00:26:47,505
I mean, that's the 
normal state of affairs.

648
00:26:47,505 --> 00:26:50,175
Why would your body 
create this enzyme

649
00:26:50,175 --> 00:26:53,011
to like just lactose after 
weaning, after infancy?

650
00:26:53,011 --> 00:26:54,512
It doesn't make any sense.

651
00:26:54,512 --> 00:26:57,649
- 73% of African-Americans 
are lactose intolerant,

652
00:26:57,649 --> 00:27:01,786
95% of Asians, roughly 
70% of Native Americans,

653
00:27:03,321 --> 00:27:06,725
and about 53% of 
Hispanic Americans are 
lactose intolerant.

654
00:27:06,725 --> 00:27:09,894
Our government is encouraging 
Americans of color

655
00:27:09,894 --> 00:27:13,098
to eat foods that it knows 
it's going to make them ill.

656
00:27:13,098 --> 00:27:14,566
Ultimately, what that is down to

657
00:27:14,566 --> 00:27:16,735
is the government are selling 
me as an African-American

658
00:27:16,735 --> 00:27:18,703
to eat food that's gonna make 
me ill for no health benefit

659
00:27:18,703 --> 00:27:21,539
so that it will 
benefit dairy farmers

660
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:24,042
as if the farmers have 
institutionalized racism.

661
00:27:24,042 --> 00:27:26,978
- Yeah, milk is a risky 
food for human consumption.

662
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:30,048
As a pediatrician, I 
see it on a daily basis,

663
00:27:30,048 --> 00:27:32,617
children suffering 
from conditions

664
00:27:32,617 --> 00:27:35,720
that are linked or associated 
to dairy consumption

665
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:39,090
such as eczema, 
acne, constipation,

666
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:42,394
acid reflux, 
iron-deficiency anemia.

667
00:27:42,394 --> 00:27:44,329
Cow's milk protein is 
the most allergenic food.

668
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:46,765
- People say, "Well no, 
I want a hormone-free,

669
00:27:46,765 --> 00:27:49,367
"not injected with 
bovine growth hormone,"

670
00:27:49,367 --> 00:27:53,371
but milk is this hormonal 
fluid which is packed

671
00:27:53,371 --> 00:27:56,574
with sex hormones and 
natural sex steroid hormones

672
00:27:56,574 --> 00:27:58,076
like estrogen, progesterone.

673
00:27:58,076 --> 00:28:00,111
In fact, doesn't matter 
if it's conventional milk,

674
00:28:00,111 --> 00:28:01,980
doesn't matter if 
it's organic milk.

675
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:04,282
Milk without hormones, 
this is an oxymoron.

676
00:28:04,282 --> 00:28:07,385
Organic dairy has just 
as much saturated fat

677
00:28:07,385 --> 00:28:10,255
and cholesterol and 
galactose, and all the things

678
00:28:10,255 --> 00:28:13,224
that you don't want 
as conventional dairy.

679
00:28:13,224 --> 00:28:15,093
- Dairy products, in 
general, have a lot

680
00:28:15,093 --> 00:28:17,262
of other products 
associated with it,

681
00:28:17,262 --> 00:28:18,930
not the least of which is pus.

682
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:21,466
I mean, they actually have 
laws limiting how much pus

683
00:28:21,466 --> 00:28:23,568
you can actually have in 
the milk and still sell it.

684
00:28:23,568 --> 00:28:26,905
I believe it's like 
750,000 pus cells per CC.

685
00:28:26,905 --> 00:28:28,573
Because, I mean, you 
wouldn't want too much pus,

686
00:28:28,573 --> 00:28:30,842
it would be like pure 
pus people might object.

687
00:28:30,842 --> 00:28:32,077
In fact, you could 
think of cheese

688
00:28:32,077 --> 00:28:34,913
as coagulated cow 
pus if you will.

689
00:28:34,913 --> 00:28:36,181
- [Kip] But I was always told

690
00:28:36,181 --> 00:28:37,982
that we need milk 
for strong bones.

691
00:28:37,982 --> 00:28:41,152
- I'm Jane Chapman 
and not too long ago,

692
00:28:41,152 --> 00:28:44,756
finally got some x-rays 
of the hips and back.

693
00:28:44,756 --> 00:28:48,326
Severe bilateral 
osteoarthritis of the hips

694
00:28:49,761 --> 00:28:52,497
and actually, I'm scheduled 
for two hip replacements.

695
00:28:52,497 --> 00:28:56,901
That's bone on bone, it is 
the grinding of the joints.

696
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:59,304
My stability is scary.

697
00:28:59,304 --> 00:29:02,207
I hold on to the 
walls if I'm at home.

698
00:29:02,207 --> 00:29:04,676
I've been told to use a walker.

699
00:29:04,676 --> 00:29:06,444
I'm only 61.

700
00:29:06,444 --> 00:29:08,046
This is not how you're 
supposed to live

701
00:29:08,046 --> 00:29:09,414
when you're this old.

702
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:12,851
I have a really hard 
time believing that.

703
00:29:14,886 --> 00:29:16,721
That's all that's left.

704
00:29:16,721 --> 00:29:19,357
- Researchers have studied 
bone development in kids

705
00:29:19,357 --> 00:29:21,926
and whether they get stress 
fractures and that kind of thing

706
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:24,529
and the kids drink the most 
milk have zero protection.

707
00:29:24,529 --> 00:29:26,631
Milk does not 
build strong bones.

708
00:29:26,631 --> 00:29:28,833
Harvard researchers have 
looked at a large group

709
00:29:28,833 --> 00:29:31,369
of older women over 
an 18-year period.

710
00:29:31,369 --> 00:29:34,572
The milk drinkers had zero 
protection from fractures.

711
00:29:34,572 --> 00:29:36,307
So, this old notion 
that somehow,

712
00:29:36,307 --> 00:29:38,009
milk is gonna build strong bones

713
00:29:38,009 --> 00:29:40,545
are protect your bones 
later in life, it's a myth.

714
00:29:40,545 --> 00:29:43,882
- People that drink milk have 
higher rates of hip fractures,

715
00:29:43,882 --> 00:29:47,552
have more cancer, and 
live shorter lives.

716
00:29:47,552 --> 00:29:48,786
- [Kip] It turns 
out that countries

717
00:29:48,786 --> 00:29:50,054
with the highest 
dairy consumption

718
00:29:50,054 --> 00:29:52,190
also have the highest 
rates of osteoporosis.

719
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:55,593
So clearly, drinking more milk 
doesn't protect your bones.

720
00:29:55,593 --> 00:29:57,529
Doing more research, I've 
found that dairy was linked

721
00:29:57,529 --> 00:30:00,031
to many different types 
of cancer as well.

722
00:30:00,031 --> 00:30:01,499
Just like many of us,

723
00:30:01,499 --> 00:30:03,601
I thought that the majority 
of cancer's due to genes

724
00:30:03,601 --> 00:30:07,038
but only 5% to 10% of 
cancer's actually genetic.

725
00:30:07,038 --> 00:30:10,441
- Any cancer is caused 
by a DNA mutation

726
00:30:10,441 --> 00:30:12,177
but that's not enough so that

727
00:30:12,177 --> 00:30:13,444
can cause that first cancer cell

728
00:30:13,444 --> 00:30:15,547
but one cancer cell 
never killed anyone.

729
00:30:15,547 --> 00:30:17,282
Two cancer cells 
never killed anyone

730
00:30:17,282 --> 00:30:19,951
but a billion cancer cells, 
now, we're running into problems

731
00:30:19,951 --> 00:30:22,287
so we need to reduce the 
growth factors in our body

732
00:30:22,287 --> 00:30:24,756
like IGF-1, insulin-like 
growth factor 1.

733
00:30:24,756 --> 00:30:26,491
It's this cancer 
promoting growth hormone

734
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:28,760
involved in every 
stage of cancer cell,

735
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:31,362
growth and spread 
and metastasis.

736
00:30:31,362 --> 00:30:35,099
Any animal protein boosts 
the level of IGF-1.

737
00:30:35,099 --> 00:30:36,801
- Dairy products 
increases your risk

738
00:30:36,801 --> 00:30:38,570
for various forms of cancer

739
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:40,605
especially those 
related to your hormones

740
00:30:40,605 --> 00:30:43,274
so breast cancer, prostate 
cancer, ovarian cancer.

741
00:30:43,274 --> 00:30:46,377
So, this is not a product 
even in its most pure state

742
00:30:46,377 --> 00:30:48,746
you wanna be consuming because 
it does come with risk.

743
00:30:48,746 --> 00:30:50,281
- [Kip] I've found out 
that dairy can increase

744
00:30:50,281 --> 00:30:53,451
a man's chance of getting 
prostate cancer by 34%.

745
00:30:53,451 --> 00:30:55,019
And for women who've 
had breast cancer,

746
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:57,188
just one serving of 
whole dairy a day

747
00:30:57,188 --> 00:31:00,525
can increase their chance of 
dying from the disease, 49%,

748
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:03,461
and dying from anything, 64%.

749
00:31:03,461 --> 00:31:05,997
Why weren't breast cancer 
sites like Susan G. Komen

750
00:31:05,997 --> 00:31:08,366
warning everyone about this?

751
00:31:09,767 --> 00:31:11,302
- [Jocelyn] You're 
calling Susan G. Komen.

752
00:31:11,302 --> 00:31:13,571
This is Jocelyn, 
how may I help you?

753
00:31:13,571 --> 00:31:15,640
- We're wondering why you 
don't have a huge warning

754
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,942
about the dangers of consuming 
dairy in your website

755
00:31:17,942 --> 00:31:20,211
when there's a direct 
link to breast cancer?

756
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:21,679
There was a study published

757
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:23,081
in the Journal of the 
National Cancer Institute,

758
00:31:23,081 --> 00:31:25,250
that found out women 
consuming dairy

759
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:26,784
who has had breast cancer

760
00:31:26,784 --> 00:31:30,188
increases their risk of 
dying of breast cancer 49%.

761
00:31:30,188 --> 00:31:33,858
Just wondering why it's 
not on your website?

762
00:31:35,293 --> 00:31:36,861
- [Jocelyn] We cannot answer 
these types of questions.

763
00:31:36,861 --> 00:31:39,030
- [Kip] Once again, another 
health organization rep

764
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:41,299
saying someone else would 
have to answer my question.

765
00:31:41,299 --> 00:31:43,201
Rather than risk 
being stood up again,

766
00:31:43,201 --> 00:31:45,370
I went straight to the 
local Susan G. Komen chapter

767
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:47,705
to see if they would 
answer my questions.

768
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:55,313
They didn't wanna answer my 
questions in person either

769
00:31:55,313 --> 00:31:57,215
and told us to stop filming,

770
00:31:57,215 --> 00:31:58,483
but promised they 
would connect me

771
00:31:58,483 --> 00:32:01,085
to the national office directly.

772
00:32:03,154 --> 00:32:05,556
Susan G. Komen's pink ribbon 
campaign had done a lot

773
00:32:05,556 --> 00:32:07,759
to raise awareness 
for breast cancer,

774
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:10,228
although, it was confusing 
to see pink ribbons

775
00:32:10,228 --> 00:32:12,697
on dairy yogurt containers.

776
00:32:12,697 --> 00:32:14,799
- Breast cancer can be prevented

777
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:17,268
with a healthy diet and 
lifestyle but we're not,

778
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:19,904
we're talking about pink ribbons

779
00:32:19,904 --> 00:32:22,140
and putting all the money 
into research for the cure.

780
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:25,843
I, for one, know that I would 
want my daughter, my mother,

781
00:32:25,843 --> 00:32:28,913
me, I wanna focus on not 
getting to that point

782
00:32:28,913 --> 00:32:30,148
and that's where I would like

783
00:32:30,148 --> 00:32:32,550
to see more energy 
and effort put.

784
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:34,385
- [Kip] I had been a 
hardcore cheesaholic

785
00:32:34,385 --> 00:32:36,054
virtually my entire life

786
00:32:36,054 --> 00:32:37,655
despite the risks but 
like so many others,

787
00:32:37,655 --> 00:32:39,757
I seem to have been 
addicted to it.

788
00:32:39,757 --> 00:32:42,760
- It turns out that 
the casein protein,

789
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:45,229
that's the main protein 
in dairy products

790
00:32:45,229 --> 00:32:46,898
particularly in 
cheese, it breaks apart

791
00:32:46,898 --> 00:32:49,000
in the human digestion to create

792
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,935
what are called casomorphins,

793
00:32:50,935 --> 00:32:54,472
casein-derived 
morphine-like compounds.

794
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:56,007
They go to the brain 
and they attach

795
00:32:56,007 --> 00:32:59,677
to the vary same receptor 
that heroin attaches to.

796
00:32:59,677 --> 00:33:01,813
Don't get me wrong, they're 
not as strong as that

797
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:04,849
but they are strong enough 
to make you come back

798
00:33:04,849 --> 00:33:06,451
again and again and again

799
00:33:06,451 --> 00:33:08,052
despite the fact that 
you're gaining weight,

800
00:33:08,052 --> 00:33:10,021
you're more unhealthy 
than you've ever been,

801
00:33:10,021 --> 00:33:12,523
but that cheese just 
calls out to people.

802
00:33:12,523 --> 00:33:15,259
- Casomorphin may 
play a role in SIDS,

803
00:33:15,259 --> 00:33:18,363
in sudden infant death syndrome, 
they play a role in autism.

804
00:33:18,363 --> 00:33:22,233
This is one of the reasons 
why don't want infants

805
00:33:22,233 --> 00:33:24,435
drinking milk from cows.

806
00:33:24,435 --> 00:33:28,005
- [Kip] Human breastmilk has 
2.7 grams of casein per liter

807
00:33:28,005 --> 00:33:31,209
compared to 26 grams per 
liter for cow's milk.

808
00:33:31,209 --> 00:33:33,411
That's practically 
10 times more.

809
00:33:33,411 --> 00:33:35,213
No wonder it's so addictive.

810
00:33:35,213 --> 00:33:37,014
This talk about addiction 
made me think about

811
00:33:37,014 --> 00:33:39,050
all the drugs animals are fed.

812
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:40,284
I went to the headquarters

813
00:33:40,284 --> 00:33:41,819
of the Center for 
Food and Safety,

814
00:33:41,819 --> 00:33:44,789
the nation's leading FDA 
government watchdog group

815
00:33:44,789 --> 00:33:47,959
to see how concerned we need 
to be about drugs in our food.

816
00:33:47,959 --> 00:33:51,929
- So, that we know of there are 
at least 450 different drugs

817
00:33:51,929 --> 00:33:53,197
that are administered to animals

818
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:54,999
either alone or in combination.

819
00:33:54,999 --> 00:33:58,369
These drugs are given to animals 
for a variety of reasons.

820
00:33:58,369 --> 00:34:01,105
Very, very few of which 
are actually beneficial

821
00:34:01,105 --> 00:34:02,540
to consumer health.

822
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:05,410
- We've got drug companies 
that work real hard

823
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:08,279
to make sure they can 
sell lots of drugs

824
00:34:08,279 --> 00:34:11,115
to people raising cows, 
pigs, and chickens.

825
00:34:11,115 --> 00:34:13,684
- The pharmaceutical 
industry sells 80%

826
00:34:13,684 --> 00:34:15,987
of all the antibiotics that 
it makes in the United States

827
00:34:15,987 --> 00:34:17,688
to animal agriculture.

828
00:34:17,688 --> 00:34:19,524
Antibiotic residues 
are found in meat.

829
00:34:19,524 --> 00:34:21,392
Other antimicrobials 
are found in meat.

830
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:23,361
There has been a 
ractopamine found in meat.

831
00:34:23,361 --> 00:34:25,029
There's been hormones 
found in meat.

832
00:34:25,029 --> 00:34:27,131
So, right there, you're talking 
about four different drugs.

833
00:34:27,131 --> 00:34:29,834
They could be in the 
same piece of meat.

834
00:34:29,834 --> 00:34:31,803
The pharmaceutical 
company supposed

835
00:34:31,803 --> 00:34:33,938
to show the safety 
of animal drugs.

836
00:34:33,938 --> 00:34:35,373
They're not really 
testing to see

837
00:34:35,373 --> 00:34:37,108
what the impacts of these 
drugs are on humans,

838
00:34:37,108 --> 00:34:38,409
they're really looking 
to see what impacts

839
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:40,077
that these drugs are on animals.

840
00:34:40,077 --> 00:34:44,015
- We try to get information 
on some of the health studies

841
00:34:44,015 --> 00:34:47,218
and the environmental studies 
from federal agencies.

842
00:34:47,218 --> 00:34:52,023
We get back page after page 
of blacked out information

843
00:34:52,023 --> 00:34:56,794
because the company 
claim confidential 
business information.

844
00:34:56,794 --> 00:35:00,565
- Consumers have no idea 
what is in the products

845
00:35:00,565 --> 00:35:01,899
that they consume.

846
00:35:01,899 --> 00:35:03,668
- So, how sick 
something makes me

847
00:35:03,668 --> 00:35:06,771
and how bad it pollutes 
the environment

848
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:08,673
is a secret for a company.

849
00:35:08,673 --> 00:35:10,241
- In the animal 
agriculture industry,

850
00:35:10,241 --> 00:35:11,709
as in the tobacco industry,

851
00:35:11,709 --> 00:35:14,278
these companies really 
have a vested interest

852
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:17,181
in making sure that the public 
doesn't have information

853
00:35:17,181 --> 00:35:19,484
about their effects 
and what risks

854
00:35:19,484 --> 00:35:21,686
are really post 
to consuming them.

855
00:35:21,686 --> 00:35:23,454
- Have the system where animals

856
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:25,389
are living in their own waste,

857
00:35:25,389 --> 00:35:29,193
they're living next to animals 
that are sick or even dead

858
00:35:29,193 --> 00:35:31,028
and they're stuck in 
cages with these animals.

859
00:35:31,028 --> 00:35:33,564
The bacteria tends to 
spread that the pathogens

860
00:35:33,564 --> 00:35:36,334
that are being created in 
these filthy conditions

861
00:35:36,334 --> 00:35:38,169
are breeding resistance 
to antibiotics

862
00:35:38,169 --> 00:35:40,538
and the public are 
becoming exposed to those.

863
00:35:40,538 --> 00:35:42,840
- We already had people 
dying from salmonella

864
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:45,443
and other things that you eat.

865
00:35:45,443 --> 00:35:48,412
We have about 3,000 
people die every year

866
00:35:48,412 --> 00:35:49,981
in the United States.

867
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:51,983
That's more than 
the number of people

868
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:56,387
that were killed in 9/11 in 
the Twin Towers of New York.

869
00:35:56,387 --> 00:35:58,656
If we had some 
terrorists organization

870
00:35:58,656 --> 00:36:02,126
killing 3,000 people a year, 
we would be all over it.

871
00:36:02,126 --> 00:36:06,063
The antibiotic-resistant 
bacteria deaths that we have

872
00:36:06,063 --> 00:36:10,134
on top of that, you get a 
20,000 people die in a year.

873
00:36:10,134 --> 00:36:13,638
That's seven 9/11's every year.

874
00:36:14,972 --> 00:36:16,541
Can you imagine?

875
00:36:16,541 --> 00:36:18,543
If that many people 
were being killed

876
00:36:18,543 --> 00:36:21,646
by some terrorist group in 
the United States every year,

877
00:36:21,646 --> 00:36:23,014
we would find them.

878
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:25,349
- The World Health Organization 
had said we're nearing

879
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:27,585
in a post-antibiotic 
era in medicine.

880
00:36:27,585 --> 00:36:29,086
You'll be at risk 
in minor surgeries

881
00:36:29,086 --> 00:36:31,088
to have a fatal infection.

882
00:36:31,088 --> 00:36:32,623
You'll be at risk 
going to the dentist

883
00:36:32,623 --> 00:36:35,760
if you have a tooth extracted 
or be like Civil War medicine.

884
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,296
You get an infection in your 
leg and you cut your leg off.

885
00:36:38,296 --> 00:36:40,731
So, you have this very 
dangerous situation.

886
00:36:40,731 --> 00:36:42,733
By crowding these animals in,

887
00:36:42,733 --> 00:36:46,304
they become a perfect 
engine for generating

888
00:36:46,304 --> 00:36:49,540
usually a virus that can 
come out into the community.

889
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:52,577
If you lived near a 
swine spray field,

890
00:36:52,577 --> 00:36:56,080
not even decay field but 
the waste disposal field,

891
00:36:56,080 --> 00:37:00,518
you are three times more 
likely to have MRSA infection.

892
00:37:00,518 --> 00:37:04,922
You can't see how that impacts 
the average person's life

893
00:37:04,922 --> 00:37:07,058
in Duplin County, North Carolina

894
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:09,961
and not be a little 
upset about it.

895
00:37:11,028 --> 00:37:12,763
- From environmental standpoint,

896
00:37:12,763 --> 00:37:14,198
from a community standpoint,

897
00:37:14,198 --> 00:37:16,434
from all other aspects, 
North Carolina,

898
00:37:16,434 --> 00:37:18,135
we're in a state of emergency.

899
00:37:18,135 --> 00:37:21,105
We've already had bouts 
of swine flu or H1N1

900
00:37:21,105 --> 00:37:22,673
as they prefer to refer to it.

901
00:37:22,673 --> 00:37:25,576
That particular swine flu 
incident was originated

902
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:28,045
on a farm here in 
North Carolina.

903
00:37:28,045 --> 00:37:30,514
There's approximately 
the same number of hogs

904
00:37:30,514 --> 00:37:32,450
in North Carolina 
as there are people.

905
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:35,720
Between eight to 10 
times the amount of feces

906
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,888
is produced by a 
hog, an adult hog

907
00:37:37,888 --> 00:37:40,157
as compared to an adult human.

908
00:37:40,157 --> 00:37:41,792
- [Kip] 10 million 
pigs in North Carolina

909
00:37:41,792 --> 00:37:44,929
produce the waste equal 
to 100 million humans.

910
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:48,332
This is the equivalent of the 
entire US eastern sea board

911
00:37:48,332 --> 00:37:50,868
flushing their toilets 
into North Carolina

912
00:37:50,868 --> 00:37:52,336
but there's no waste treatment.

913
00:37:52,336 --> 00:37:54,438
The pigs' waste falls 
through slats in the floors

914
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:56,173
of the sheds they are 
forced to live in.

915
00:37:56,173 --> 00:37:58,109
It is then pumped in 
the giant waste pits

916
00:37:58,109 --> 00:37:59,977
which leach in the 
rivers and streams

917
00:37:59,977 --> 00:38:02,546
and is pumped out 
unfiltered on the fields

918
00:38:02,546 --> 00:38:06,217
further polluting 
the environment and 
neighboring health.

919
00:38:06,217 --> 00:38:07,918
- When you go back 
and you look at

920
00:38:07,918 --> 00:38:10,187
where these hog 
facilities are located,

921
00:38:10,187 --> 00:38:12,723
there's a disproportionate 
number of them

922
00:38:12,723 --> 00:38:15,826
that are located near 
communities of color,

923
00:38:15,826 --> 00:38:17,061
low income communities.

924
00:38:17,061 --> 00:38:20,231
It is definitely a 
human rights issue.

925
00:38:20,231 --> 00:38:22,733
- My sister, she have 
asthma and you know,

926
00:38:22,733 --> 00:38:25,336
her brother, he have asthma.

927
00:38:25,336 --> 00:38:29,440
He's three and we don't 
know what she might have.

928
00:38:30,841 --> 00:38:34,545
I have asthma, I have 
sinus, I have sarcoidosis,

929
00:38:34,545 --> 00:38:36,247
that's what the bacteria,

930
00:38:36,247 --> 00:38:40,851
and I have a pacemaker which 
is sick sinus syndrome.

931
00:38:40,851 --> 00:38:43,220
Mostly everybody in 
this neighborhood

932
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:45,423
got asthma or even cancer.

933
00:38:45,423 --> 00:38:49,593
My neighbor there died from 
cancer probably just last year.

934
00:38:49,593 --> 00:38:51,696
My nephew down the 
street, he's got cancer.

935
00:38:51,696 --> 00:38:54,065
He's in terminal 
cancer stage four,

936
00:38:54,065 --> 00:38:56,634
not a smoker, not a drinker.

937
00:38:56,634 --> 00:38:59,670
And it's not in his lungs, 
it's in his lip nose.

938
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:03,007
'Cause if you live here 
and saw the way they do,

939
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:04,709
you will eat no pork.

940
00:39:04,709 --> 00:39:07,611
We don't eat bacon because 
I know it come from.

941
00:39:07,611 --> 00:39:10,181
When they die, 
they go into a box

942
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:12,550
and they decompose 
because they swell from,

943
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:14,218
especially from heat.

944
00:39:14,218 --> 00:39:17,054
A truck come and pick 'em up,

945
00:39:17,054 --> 00:39:19,957
take 'em to the processing 
plant in Roseville,

946
00:39:19,957 --> 00:39:24,829
round 'em up into feed, and 
feed it back to the hogs.

947
00:39:24,829 --> 00:39:26,564
Come at this door, if 
he's spraying there,

948
00:39:26,564 --> 00:39:28,032
it's then come in my face.

949
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:29,567
It hits you right in that face.

950
00:39:29,567 --> 00:39:31,435
It smells like something that 
you had never smelled before,

951
00:39:31,435 --> 00:39:34,538
something rotten and dead body.

952
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:36,107
It's the family graveyard.

953
00:39:36,107 --> 00:39:37,908
I have my grandmother there,

954
00:39:37,908 --> 00:39:40,511
my sisters, my brothers.

955
00:39:40,511 --> 00:39:42,880
When we go to funeral, 
he used to spray.

956
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,081
- [Kip] During the funeral?

957
00:39:44,081 --> 00:39:46,517
- Yes, during the funeral.

958
00:39:46,517 --> 00:39:48,686
Yeah, they spray,

959
00:39:48,686 --> 00:39:50,287
and when the people come,

960
00:39:50,287 --> 00:39:52,890
everybody be closing their 
nose up saying how it stank.

961
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:56,093
They can wanna with a cookout 
on Sunday, he'll spray.

962
00:39:56,093 --> 00:39:57,595
- Do you think he 
does that on purpose?

963
00:39:57,595 --> 00:40:00,531
- I think so 'cause he 
just spray at Sunday.

964
00:40:00,531 --> 00:40:02,700
He always spray at Sunday.

965
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:06,370
And most of these area, hog 
houses and turkey house,

966
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:09,940
is in the black area 
or the Hispanic area.

967
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:11,575
It's either or.

968
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:13,778
- Do you think it's 
also civil rights issue?

969
00:40:13,778 --> 00:40:16,113
- Yes, yes, I do, yes, I do.

970
00:40:23,821 --> 00:40:26,190
- There have been 
times in the past

971
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:29,326
that I have gotten 
rid on the Sunday,

972
00:40:29,326 --> 00:40:30,795
gotten rid of going to church

973
00:40:30,795 --> 00:40:33,631
and come out and the 
smell was so strong

974
00:40:33,631 --> 00:40:36,433
that I had to go 
back and regroup

975
00:40:36,433 --> 00:40:37,868
because it got in my clothes

976
00:40:37,868 --> 00:40:40,437
and I ain't just 
gonna go to church

977
00:40:40,437 --> 00:40:43,140
smelling like hogs, 
I just can't do it.

978
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:46,343
I don't think to grow my kids.

979
00:40:46,343 --> 00:40:49,180
They care more about cooperation

980
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:52,149
than do people's inner visions.

981
00:40:52,149 --> 00:40:53,417
- And they're gonna keep on.

982
00:40:53,417 --> 00:40:54,919
They're gonna put more 
chickens in this state.

983
00:40:54,919 --> 00:40:56,387
This is the feces and you're 
in captain of the world

984
00:40:56,387 --> 00:40:59,423
right here in North 
Carolina, my state.

985
00:40:59,423 --> 00:41:01,425
There's a blue line 
stream right here

986
00:41:01,425 --> 00:41:03,093
come into my property almost

987
00:41:03,093 --> 00:41:04,528
and the continue 
creek, right here.

988
00:41:04,528 --> 00:41:06,831
I've seen that blue line 
stream in that field

989
00:41:06,831 --> 00:41:08,999
with feces and urine 
from that hog pen

990
00:41:08,999 --> 00:41:11,268
and they can say, "Well, 
we feed the world."

991
00:41:11,268 --> 00:41:12,903
They're not interested 
in feeding the world,

992
00:41:12,903 --> 00:41:14,371
they're interested 
in making money.

993
00:41:14,371 --> 00:41:17,141
You take the money away from 
and let the folks starve

994
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:18,609
'cause if you want 
to feed the world,

995
00:41:18,609 --> 00:41:21,312
you can feed the world with 
more corn, using corn and wheat,

996
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:22,813
instead of that and 
your canned meat.

997
00:41:22,813 --> 00:41:24,315
Meat is a luxury item.

998
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:27,384
When we are doing things 
that hurt other people,

999
00:41:27,384 --> 00:41:30,020
we're wrong, but a 
lot of good people

1000
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:33,691
will sit there and 
eat bacon knowing

1001
00:41:33,691 --> 00:41:37,862
that it's causing someone 
else to be very unhappy.

1002
00:41:39,463 --> 00:41:40,631
- I woke up the next morning

1003
00:41:40,631 --> 00:41:42,066
to find the Bern 
River had experienced

1004
00:41:42,066 --> 00:41:43,734
another massive fish kill

1005
00:41:43,734 --> 00:41:46,370
from the pollution 
running off hog farms.

1006
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:50,774
Tens of thousands of fish 
were washing up on shore.

1007
00:41:50,774 --> 00:41:52,076
All this talk about 
health, I realized

1008
00:41:52,076 --> 00:41:55,179
that I was only focused 
on personal health,

1009
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:57,715
but health started to 
mean so much more to me.

1010
00:41:57,715 --> 00:42:00,284
It was about health of my 
family and our communities.

1011
00:42:00,284 --> 00:42:02,253
I couldn't honor good, 
conscious supporting industry

1012
00:42:02,253 --> 00:42:04,755
that I knew is harming others.

1013
00:42:06,657 --> 00:42:09,293
Pollution from animal 
agriculture isn't just an issue

1014
00:42:09,293 --> 00:42:10,728
in North Carolina though.

1015
00:42:10,728 --> 00:42:13,430
Raising animals for food 
produces more greenhouse gases

1016
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:15,900
than the entire 
transportation sector.

1017
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:17,935
It's the leading cause of 
rainforest destruction,

1018
00:42:17,935 --> 00:42:20,437
species extinction, 
ocean dead zones,

1019
00:42:20,437 --> 00:42:22,673
and freshwater consumption.

1020
00:42:27,745 --> 00:42:31,015
American Diabetes Association 
actually finally got back

1021
00:42:31,015 --> 00:42:33,684
and they agreed to an interview.

1022
00:42:35,052 --> 00:42:37,454
Preparing for the American 
Diabetes Association interview,

1023
00:42:37,454 --> 00:42:39,023
I took a look at their diabetes

1024
00:42:39,023 --> 00:42:40,758
diet meal plan recommendations

1025
00:42:40,758 --> 00:42:42,726
and they were loaded with foods

1026
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:45,262
associated with 
causing diabetes.

1027
00:42:45,262 --> 00:42:47,598
How could they expect 
people not to get diabetes

1028
00:42:47,598 --> 00:42:50,701
if this was the food 
they're recommending?

1029
00:42:50,701 --> 00:42:53,437
And then, I saw multiple 
peer reviewed studies

1030
00:42:53,437 --> 00:42:55,572
published on the National 
Institute of Health website

1031
00:42:55,572 --> 00:42:57,608
showing that a low-fat 
plant-based diet

1032
00:42:57,608 --> 00:42:59,810
was more than twice as 
powerful at controlling

1033
00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:03,414
and even reversing diabetes 
than the 88 recommended diet

1034
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:06,250
that included meat and dairy.

1035
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:09,820
- Well, the mission of the 
American Diabetes Association

1036
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:13,991
is to identify a prevention 
and a cure for diabetes.

1037
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:19,063
But in the meantime, 
to improve the lives

1038
00:43:19,063 --> 00:43:22,333
of all people who are 
affected by diabetes.

1039
00:43:22,333 --> 00:43:25,836
- And what's the best 
way to prevent this?

1040
00:43:27,471 --> 00:43:30,307
- For type II 
diabetes, it's unclear.

1041
00:43:30,307 --> 00:43:34,745
We can't prevent type II 
diabetes in everybody.

1042
00:43:34,745 --> 00:43:37,948
- During a research, we 
came across a lot of studies

1043
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:42,119
that said that you actually 
could potentially cure

1044
00:43:43,554 --> 00:43:47,091
or reverse diabetes with 
a purely plant-based diet.

1045
00:43:47,091 --> 00:43:49,026
- I don't believe there 
is sufficient evidence

1046
00:43:49,026 --> 00:43:50,694
to demonstrate that.

1047
00:43:52,162 --> 00:43:56,266
- How does it compare to the 
ADA diet that you recommend?

1048
00:43:56,266 --> 00:43:58,135
- We don't recommend 
a specific diet.

1049
00:43:58,135 --> 00:44:00,738
We recommend healthy eating.

1050
00:44:00,738 --> 00:44:02,239
- The one that's on the website?

1051
00:44:02,239 --> 00:44:04,842
- We recommend healthy 
eating, there is--

1052
00:44:04,842 --> 00:44:08,512
- You have a whole list 
of exact day-to-day,

1053
00:44:09,947 --> 00:44:11,582
the meal plan, the 
whole meal plan?

1054
00:44:11,582 --> 00:44:14,785
- All they are are selections 
of foods to consider.

1055
00:44:14,785 --> 00:44:17,121
We do not have a diabetes diet.

1056
00:44:17,121 --> 00:44:21,525
- But with that selections, 
do you consider that plan

1057
00:44:21,525 --> 00:44:24,228
compared to a whole 
plant-based plan?

1058
00:44:24,228 --> 00:44:26,497
- No one's done that study.

1059
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:28,265
- We've found 
actually some studies,

1060
00:44:28,265 --> 00:44:31,035
a 74-week study found 
that low-fat vegan diet

1061
00:44:31,035 --> 00:44:34,772
versus the ADA plan 
in type II diabetes--

1062
00:44:34,772 --> 00:44:36,473
- I think we're done here.

1063
00:44:36,473 --> 00:44:39,309
I'm not gonna get into 
an argument about--

1064
00:44:39,309 --> 00:44:43,180
- Oh no, I just went 
into studies of, the 
studies of the...

1065
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:46,050
If this is true or if 
it's shows out of--

1066
00:44:46,050 --> 00:44:47,451
- Any diet works.

1067
00:44:49,319 --> 00:44:52,256
Any diet works if 
people follow it.

1068
00:44:53,690 --> 00:44:57,061
- But if it's a diet 
that's not the proper diet,

1069
00:44:57,061 --> 00:44:59,096
like if anyone follows 
a diet that the--

1070
00:44:59,096 --> 00:45:02,699
- I can't tell you 
what a proper diet is.

1071
00:45:02,699 --> 00:45:05,469
I can tell you what 
an improper diet is.

1072
00:45:05,469 --> 00:45:09,073
- So then, we can talk 
about the good diets.

1073
00:45:09,073 --> 00:45:10,007
I'm not sure why--

1074
00:45:10,007 --> 00:45:11,675
- I'm not gonna get into that.

1075
00:45:11,675 --> 00:45:12,509
- Into diet?

1076
00:45:12,509 --> 00:45:13,844
- No. 
- Well, why not?

1077
00:45:13,844 --> 00:45:16,447
- If that's where you 
wanna go with this,

1078
00:45:16,447 --> 00:45:18,982
I'm sorry, I'm not the person 
that you should be talking to.

1079
00:45:18,982 --> 00:45:20,350
- And why is that though?

1080
00:45:20,350 --> 00:45:22,219
- If that's what 
you wanna get into,

1081
00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:24,021
I'm not the person you 
need to be talking to.

1082
00:45:24,021 --> 00:45:26,623
- [Kip] Who do we 
talk to about diet?

1083
00:45:26,623 --> 00:45:28,525
- You can talk to 
anybody you want.

1084
00:45:28,525 --> 00:45:30,861
- But that's interesting, 
then why not recommend a diet?

1085
00:45:30,861 --> 00:45:32,896
- Because the data don't 
exist to support it.

1086
00:45:32,896 --> 00:45:36,567
- But if I've see, we see 
data that we looked up,

1087
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:39,002
that supports it 
with like the NIH,

1088
00:45:39,002 --> 00:45:41,171
in Europe, the European--

1089
00:45:42,339 --> 00:45:43,440
- We're done.

1090
00:45:44,975 --> 00:45:46,210
We're done, I'm sorry.

1091
00:45:46,210 --> 00:45:47,377
I'm not gonna get 
into that argument.

1092
00:45:47,377 --> 00:45:48,645
- But why is there an argument?

1093
00:45:48,645 --> 00:45:49,580
- I'm not gonna get 
into that argument.

1094
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:51,081
- But why is there an argument?

1095
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:54,451
It's just the talking about 
in European Study of Diabetes

1096
00:45:54,451 --> 00:45:58,222
and other places that 
have studies why--

1097
00:45:58,222 --> 00:45:59,623
- There are lots of studies.

1098
00:45:59,623 --> 00:46:01,058
- [Kip] Why is this 
even an argument?

1099
00:46:01,058 --> 00:46:04,194
- There are lots of 
studies in the literature,

1100
00:46:04,194 --> 00:46:07,064
many of which have 
never been replicated

1101
00:46:07,064 --> 00:46:09,133
or frankly, you're wrong.

1102
00:46:10,634 --> 00:46:13,704
That's why we do 
peer review, okay?

1103
00:46:13,704 --> 00:46:16,740
- The European Association 
of Study of Diabetes

1104
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:18,809
has been peer reviewed or--

1105
00:46:18,809 --> 00:46:21,111
- I don't know what 
study you're referring to

1106
00:46:21,111 --> 00:46:23,614
and yeah, in the absence of 
being able to see that study,

1107
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:24,882
I'm not gonna comment.

1108
00:46:24,882 --> 00:46:26,083
- I could show it to you.

1109
00:46:26,083 --> 00:46:27,718
- I'm sorry, I don't 
have the time for that.

1110
00:46:27,718 --> 00:46:28,652
- I just don't understand why

1111
00:46:28,652 --> 00:46:31,221
it's an argument though or okay.

1112
00:46:39,596 --> 00:46:41,198
That was interesting.

1113
00:46:41,198 --> 00:46:42,432
What he wanna talk about

1114
00:46:42,432 --> 00:46:44,468
was people living 
longer with diabetes

1115
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:47,804
but once he mentioned 
eliminating diabetes 
or prevention,

1116
00:46:47,804 --> 00:46:50,274
oh, whoa, now you 
cross the line.

1117
00:46:50,274 --> 00:46:55,145
Prevention and cure, whoa, 
whoa, let's not go there.

1118
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:57,948
Not only did Dr. Ratner, 
the chief medical officer

1119
00:46:57,948 --> 00:47:00,150
of the American 
Diabetes Association

1120
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:02,019
not wanna talk about 
diet but the fact

1121
00:47:02,019 --> 00:47:04,588
that he had such an emotional 
reaction to my question

1122
00:47:04,588 --> 00:47:06,590
made it feel, I was 
digging into something

1123
00:47:06,590 --> 00:47:08,559
that he didn't want uncovered.

1124
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:10,794
I had always thought 
there was no prevention

1125
00:47:10,794 --> 00:47:13,430
for type I diabetes but then,

1126
00:47:13,430 --> 00:47:15,499
I did research and came 
across countless studies

1127
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:17,134
referencing the link 
between exposure

1128
00:47:17,134 --> 00:47:20,537
to dairy at a young 
age in type I diabetes.

1129
00:47:20,537 --> 00:47:22,739
- This is a food 
made for baby cows.

1130
00:47:22,739 --> 00:47:25,409
Cow milk protein get in the 
bloodstream and the body says,

1131
00:47:25,409 --> 00:47:27,077
"Hey, this is not supposed 
to be in bloodstream."

1132
00:47:27,077 --> 00:47:28,812
It makes antibodies, 
the cow milk protein,

1133
00:47:28,812 --> 00:47:32,616
which then attack the pancreas 
and destroy the pancreas.

1134
00:47:32,616 --> 00:47:34,084
- [Kip] How is this 
possible that ADA

1135
00:47:34,084 --> 00:47:36,386
wouldn't have this 
forefront on their website?

1136
00:47:36,386 --> 00:47:38,422
Why wouldn't they be warning 
all parents about this

1137
00:47:38,422 --> 00:47:40,557
even if there are 
only a slight chance?

1138
00:47:40,557 --> 00:47:42,226
Why were they 
recommending people

1139
00:47:42,226 --> 00:47:45,095
to actually eat these 
foods linked to diabetes?

1140
00:47:45,095 --> 00:47:47,197
It seemed all of the 
large health organizations

1141
00:47:47,197 --> 00:47:49,366
were encouraging people 
to eat the very foods

1142
00:47:49,366 --> 00:47:50,801
linked to the diseases,

1143
00:47:50,801 --> 00:47:52,936
they're supposed to 
be fighting against.

1144
00:47:52,936 --> 00:47:55,005
American Heart Association 
promoting beef,

1145
00:47:55,005 --> 00:47:57,341
American Cancer Society 
promoting processed meat,

1146
00:47:57,341 --> 00:47:59,209
pink ribbons on dairy products,

1147
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:03,447
and bacon wrapped shrimp on 
American Diabetes Association.

1148
00:48:03,447 --> 00:48:06,750
And then, it all came together.

1149
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:07,584
What if?

1150
00:48:12,256 --> 00:48:13,390
And there it was.

1151
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:14,758
The American 
Diabetes Association

1152
00:48:14,758 --> 00:48:16,426
was taking money from Dannon,

1153
00:48:16,426 --> 00:48:18,428
one of the world's largest 
dairy yogurt producers,

1154
00:48:18,428 --> 00:48:20,697
Kraft Foods, makers of 
Velveeta processed cheese,

1155
00:48:20,697 --> 00:48:22,099
Oscar Mayer processed meats,

1156
00:48:22,099 --> 00:48:23,834
Lunchables processed 
kids' meals,

1157
00:48:23,834 --> 00:48:28,005
and Bumble Bee Foods, makers 
of processed canned meats.

1158
00:48:30,974 --> 00:48:33,543
American Cancer Society was 
taking money from Tyson,

1159
00:48:33,543 --> 00:48:35,512
one of the world's 
largest meat producers

1160
00:48:35,512 --> 00:48:39,716
and Yum brand, owner of Pizza 
Hut, KFC, and Taco Bell.

1161
00:48:39,716 --> 00:48:42,386
Susan G. Komen was supposed 
to be fighting breast cancer

1162
00:48:42,386 --> 00:48:44,454
was corporate 
partnering with KFC,

1163
00:48:44,454 --> 00:48:48,458
Dietz & Watson processed 
meats, and Yoplait yogurt.

1164
00:48:48,458 --> 00:48:49,826
And the American 
Heart Association

1165
00:48:49,826 --> 00:48:52,296
was probably the most 
disturbing of all.

1166
00:48:52,296 --> 00:48:53,897
Taking hundreds of 
thousands of dollars

1167
00:48:53,897 --> 00:48:57,200
from the beef industry, 
poultry, and dairy producers,

1168
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:58,969
and millions from fast food

1169
00:48:58,969 --> 00:49:01,672
and processed food 
manufacturers.

1170
00:49:03,273 --> 00:49:05,342
Every single one of 
these organizations

1171
00:49:05,342 --> 00:49:07,844
was taking money from 
meat and dairy companies

1172
00:49:07,844 --> 00:49:11,214
that are associated with the 
causes of these diseases.

1173
00:49:11,214 --> 00:49:12,749
This would be like the 
American Lung Association

1174
00:49:12,749 --> 00:49:16,219
taking money from 
the tobacco industry.

1175
00:49:16,219 --> 00:49:18,922
I was sick of not 
getting answers

1176
00:49:18,922 --> 00:49:19,856
so I went to the headquarters

1177
00:49:19,856 --> 00:49:21,758
of these organizations myself.

1178
00:49:21,758 --> 00:49:23,794
We have to speak 
someone in person.

1179
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:26,563
There's millions of people 
dying from the foods

1180
00:49:26,563 --> 00:49:29,433
that they are recommending 
people to eat.

1181
00:49:29,433 --> 00:49:31,101
I wanted to find out 
why Susan G. Komen

1182
00:49:31,101 --> 00:49:34,137
accepted 35 millions 
dollars from Yoplait

1183
00:49:34,137 --> 00:49:36,006
when their products can 
increase a woman's chance

1184
00:49:36,006 --> 00:49:38,975
of dying from breast cancer 49%.

1185
00:49:38,975 --> 00:49:40,410
And asked American 
Cancer Society

1186
00:49:40,410 --> 00:49:42,012
of taking money 
from KFC and Tyson

1187
00:49:42,012 --> 00:49:45,248
what's the reason they 
promote eating meat.

1188
00:49:45,248 --> 00:49:46,750
But everyone of 
these organizations

1189
00:49:46,750 --> 00:49:49,820
declined to be interviewed.

1190
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:52,723
- What's really sad is that 
we cannot trust information

1191
00:49:52,723 --> 00:49:55,625
from these leading 
health organizations

1192
00:49:55,625 --> 00:49:57,127
like the American 
Heart Association,

1193
00:49:57,127 --> 00:49:58,862
the American 
Diabetes Association,

1194
00:49:58,862 --> 00:50:02,366
because they are taking money 
from the very industries

1195
00:50:02,366 --> 00:50:04,034
who are causing the problems

1196
00:50:04,034 --> 00:50:07,070
that they're supposed to 
be helping to prevent.

1197
00:50:07,070 --> 00:50:09,973
- So, that makes 
the truth something

1198
00:50:09,973 --> 00:50:13,143
that you are not gonna be 
hearing as far as nutrition goes

1199
00:50:13,143 --> 00:50:15,145
from these organizations.

1200
00:50:15,145 --> 00:50:16,680
Well, that would be the 
end of their funding,

1201
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:18,348
that would be the 
end of their jobs,

1202
00:50:18,348 --> 00:50:20,283
there would be lawsuits, 
they would bring

1203
00:50:20,283 --> 00:50:22,619
the entire catastrophe 
down upon their heads,

1204
00:50:22,619 --> 00:50:24,688
and they would essentially 
disappear as organizations.

1205
00:50:24,688 --> 00:50:27,924
- So, one time I got invited 
to a charity fundraiser

1206
00:50:27,924 --> 00:50:30,193
for the American 
Diabetes Association.

1207
00:50:30,193 --> 00:50:32,129
I showed up and they 
had a whole buffet

1208
00:50:32,129 --> 00:50:35,098
and there was all 
just animal products.

1209
00:50:35,098 --> 00:50:39,069
I remember like a big 
thing of barbecue chicken,

1210
00:50:39,069 --> 00:50:40,737
and I was, like I stormed out.

1211
00:50:40,737 --> 00:50:44,408
I said, "Serving chicken 
at a diabetes event

1212
00:50:45,909 --> 00:50:48,412
"is like serving alcohol 
in an AA meeting.

1213
00:50:48,412 --> 00:50:50,814
"It just doesn't make sense."

1214
00:50:51,982 --> 00:50:53,316
- [Kip] We had scheduled 
a filming interview

1215
00:50:53,316 --> 00:50:55,185
with a prominent surgeon

1216
00:50:55,185 --> 00:50:57,020
but before we could get 
inside the building,

1217
00:50:57,020 --> 00:51:00,457
the hospital's media 
relations manager stopped us.

1218
00:51:00,457 --> 00:51:01,925
- [Lady In White Blouse] 
Actually, I understand

1219
00:51:01,925 --> 00:51:03,560
that Dr. that you
could film here today

1220
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:06,963
but unfortunately, that's 
not gonna be able to happen.

1221
00:51:06,963 --> 00:51:09,733
I know that he advocates for 
patients changing their diets

1222
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:12,402
but the hospital makes 
money off these surgeries

1223
00:51:12,402 --> 00:51:14,438
and the reality is he does too.

1224
00:51:14,438 --> 00:51:16,907
So, we can't do anything 
that's gonna negatively

1225
00:51:16,907 --> 00:51:18,742
impact the hospital 
so unfortunately,

1226
00:51:18,742 --> 00:51:22,746
you're not gonna be 
able to film here today.

1227
00:51:22,746 --> 00:51:24,548
- [Kip] I was sickened 
by how open she was

1228
00:51:24,548 --> 00:51:26,450
about the hospital 
being more interested

1229
00:51:26,450 --> 00:51:29,419
in profits than people's health.

1230
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:32,456
But it wasn't just this 
hospital or these organizations,

1231
00:51:32,456 --> 00:51:35,225
even the US government 
is involved too.

1232
00:51:35,225 --> 00:51:37,327
Every five years, the US 
Department or Agriculture

1233
00:51:37,327 --> 00:51:39,529
creates dietary 
guidelines for Americans.

1234
00:51:39,529 --> 00:51:41,298
The committee who 
writes these guidelines

1235
00:51:41,298 --> 00:51:42,699
has been made up of individuals

1236
00:51:42,699 --> 00:51:44,334
who have received 
money from McDonald's,

1237
00:51:44,334 --> 00:51:46,703
the National Dairy Council, 
the American Meat Institute,

1238
00:51:46,703 --> 00:51:47,971
the National Dairy Board,

1239
00:51:47,971 --> 00:51:49,439
the National Livestock 
and Meat Board,

1240
00:51:49,439 --> 00:51:52,142
the American Egg Board, Dannon, 
candy and sugar companies,

1241
00:51:52,142 --> 00:51:55,145
Coca-Cola, and Anheuser, 
just to name a few,

1242
00:51:55,145 --> 00:51:57,214
which means we're getting 
our dietary recommendations

1243
00:51:57,214 --> 00:51:59,783
from the very industries 
that are killing us.

1244
00:51:59,783 --> 00:52:02,986
- And when they, the 
USDA, makes a pyramid

1245
00:52:02,986 --> 00:52:06,223
or a power plate every five 
years for the American public,

1246
00:52:06,223 --> 00:52:08,058
they're gonna guarantee 
that on that plate

1247
00:52:08,058 --> 00:52:11,228
are gonna be foods 
which when consumed,

1248
00:52:11,228 --> 00:52:15,332
will result in means of 
American's perishing.

1249
00:52:15,332 --> 00:52:17,367
- The USDA which is 
supposed to be protecting us

1250
00:52:17,367 --> 00:52:19,503
has two missions, it's 
supposed to protect us

1251
00:52:19,503 --> 00:52:22,906
and it's supposed to protect 
the producer, and guess what?

1252
00:52:22,906 --> 00:52:25,075
When those two 
come head to head,

1253
00:52:25,075 --> 00:52:26,610
they usually choose 
the producer.

1254
00:52:26,610 --> 00:52:29,045
- [Kip] In internal documents 
uncovered by Dr. Gregor,

1255
00:52:29,045 --> 00:52:31,781
the USDA admitted that eggs 
cannot legally be called

1256
00:52:31,781 --> 00:52:34,017
nutritious, low-fat, part 
of the balanced diet,

1257
00:52:34,017 --> 00:52:35,785
low calorie, healthful, healthy,

1258
00:52:35,785 --> 00:52:38,355
can't say it's good 
for you, or even safe,

1259
00:52:38,355 --> 00:52:39,823
yet they still 
promote these products

1260
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:43,126
to the American people through 
federal checkoff programs.

1261
00:52:43,126 --> 00:52:44,594
- If you ask somebody 
if they've heard

1262
00:52:44,594 --> 00:52:46,496
the checkoff program, they'll 
answer that they haven't,

1263
00:52:46,496 --> 00:52:49,132
although daily, they 
are seeing the messaging

1264
00:52:49,132 --> 00:52:50,934
that these programs produce.

1265
00:52:50,934 --> 00:52:52,702
So, checkoff programs 
are responsible

1266
00:52:52,702 --> 00:52:55,505
for the messages 
that we see on TV,

1267
00:52:55,505 --> 00:52:57,574
on the internet, on bus 
billboards, and magazines

1268
00:52:57,574 --> 00:53:00,076
that say things like, "Milk, 
it does the body good"

1269
00:53:00,076 --> 00:53:03,313
or "Milk life," "Beef, 
it's what's for dinner,"

1270
00:53:03,313 --> 00:53:06,716
"Pork, be inspired," 
"Incredible, edible egg."

1271
00:53:06,716 --> 00:53:10,554
- The dairy checkoff program, 
be it 12 million dollars

1272
00:53:10,554 --> 00:53:14,257
to dominoes, to just market 
cheese-heavy product.

1273
00:53:14,257 --> 00:53:16,359
And this is the USDA, 
this is the government.

1274
00:53:16,359 --> 00:53:18,428
If you've seen those ads 
for the Pizza Hut pizza,

1275
00:53:18,428 --> 00:53:21,898
the stuffed crust or 
a pound of cheese,

1276
00:53:21,898 --> 00:53:24,167
those are all government 
advertising schemes

1277
00:53:24,167 --> 00:53:25,468
for the industry.

1278
00:53:25,468 --> 00:53:26,970
How can we put more 
cheese on beef,

1279
00:53:26,970 --> 00:53:31,041
how can we put more milk in 
a coffee, things like that

1280
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:33,543
to just drive 
consumption of these

1281
00:53:33,543 --> 00:53:36,446
just unbelievably 
unhealthful products.

1282
00:53:36,446 --> 00:53:37,614
So, McDonald's, for instance,

1283
00:53:37,614 --> 00:53:40,684
has six people staffed full-time

1284
00:53:40,684 --> 00:53:42,218
according to records we've found

1285
00:53:42,218 --> 00:53:45,755
who's salaries are paid for 
by this government program

1286
00:53:45,755 --> 00:53:48,992
but funded by the producers 
who are regulated by it.

1287
00:53:48,992 --> 00:53:51,695
And these six people sit there 
at McDonald's headquarters

1288
00:53:51,695 --> 00:53:54,030
and just come up with ideas.

1289
00:53:55,231 --> 00:53:58,234
- Triple cheese decker McCheese

1290
00:53:58,234 --> 00:54:01,071
muffin stuffed 
bacon cheese slider?

1291
00:54:04,774 --> 00:54:05,909
- With extra cheese?

1292
00:54:05,909 --> 00:54:07,277
- [All] Yes.

1293
00:54:07,277 --> 00:54:09,579
- You don't think of it 
on a day-to-day basis

1294
00:54:09,579 --> 00:54:12,048
that these are 
government programs.

1295
00:54:12,048 --> 00:54:16,219
Wendy's bacon 
double cheeseburger, 
government program.

1296
00:54:17,687 --> 00:54:21,191
The steak fajita at Dunkin' 
Donuts, government program.

1297
00:54:21,191 --> 00:54:23,827
You would just never think 
that this just pure garbage

1298
00:54:23,827 --> 00:54:26,529
from a food standpoint is coming

1299
00:54:26,529 --> 00:54:28,665
from a federally funded program.

1300
00:54:28,665 --> 00:54:30,233
That's one of the things 
that makes checkoffs

1301
00:54:30,233 --> 00:54:33,837
so incredibly creepy is 
that it is our government

1302
00:54:33,837 --> 00:54:36,539
telling us, "Eat more 
beef, drink more milk,

1303
00:54:36,539 --> 00:54:38,908
"eat more cheese, 
eat more pork."

1304
00:54:38,908 --> 00:54:40,944
One of the very effective 
ways that the dairy industry

1305
00:54:40,944 --> 00:54:44,447
promotes its products 
is to reach children

1306
00:54:45,315 --> 00:54:47,617
because kids are impressionable,

1307
00:54:47,617 --> 00:54:50,020
they're gonna be consumers 
for their entire lives,

1308
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:51,955
and you might as well get 
'em while they're young.

1309
00:54:51,955 --> 00:54:54,424
So, dairy spends at 
least 50 million dollars

1310
00:54:54,424 --> 00:54:57,060
promoting it's products 
in public schools

1311
00:54:57,060 --> 00:54:59,462
throughout the 
country with posters

1312
00:54:59,462 --> 00:55:01,598
with people with milk mustaches

1313
00:55:01,598 --> 00:55:05,001
and messages like, "Milk, 
it does the body good,"

1314
00:55:05,001 --> 00:55:06,503
or "Milk life".

1315
00:55:06,503 --> 00:55:08,872
- Targeting young people 
like the tobacco industry

1316
00:55:08,872 --> 00:55:11,107
had to keep replacing the 
customers who are dying

1317
00:55:11,107 --> 00:55:13,109
with new customers.

1318
00:55:13,109 --> 00:55:15,612
Meat industry knows they 
have to target young people,

1319
00:55:15,612 --> 00:55:17,981
that's why we have 
these foods in schools

1320
00:55:17,981 --> 00:55:20,150
and marketing messages at 
a younger and younger age

1321
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:22,852
for kids to get hooked on 
all the wrong kinds of foods.

1322
00:55:22,852 --> 00:55:25,221
So, there's all 
kinds of parallels.

1323
00:55:25,221 --> 00:55:27,457
- School districts 
where processed meats

1324
00:55:27,457 --> 00:55:28,692
are all over the place.

1325
00:55:28,692 --> 00:55:29,959
Maybe it's gonna be 
bacon on the menu,

1326
00:55:29,959 --> 00:55:32,929
sausage, hotdogs, 
or pepperoni pizza.

1327
00:55:32,929 --> 00:55:34,397
Any of those things 
are processed meats

1328
00:55:34,397 --> 00:55:36,700
and those are pretty much 
the worst of the worst

1329
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:38,835
with a direct link 
to colon cancer

1330
00:55:38,835 --> 00:55:41,071
and yet you have 
everyday in schools,

1331
00:55:41,071 --> 00:55:43,239
meal items with processed meats.

1332
00:55:43,239 --> 00:55:44,774
- [Kip] If the surgeon 
general puts label warnings

1333
00:55:44,774 --> 00:55:47,343
on tobacco because 
of their cancer risk,

1334
00:55:47,343 --> 00:55:50,613
why aren't same 
warning labels on meat?

1335
00:55:51,681 --> 00:55:53,450
- Based on the publicly 
available data,

1336
00:55:53,450 --> 00:55:56,486
we know they spend at 
least 557 million dollars

1337
00:55:56,486 --> 00:55:59,089
promoting their goods 
through checkoff programs.

1338
00:55:59,089 --> 00:56:01,758
We know that they spend at 
least 138 million dollars

1339
00:56:01,758 --> 00:56:03,393
lobbying congress.

1340
00:56:03,393 --> 00:56:05,695
We expect that they spend 
a good deal more than that

1341
00:56:05,695 --> 00:56:08,531
in figures that simply 
aren't publicly disclosed.

1342
00:56:08,531 --> 00:56:10,366
- [Kip] The industry's 
lobbying power is so strong

1343
00:56:10,366 --> 00:56:12,602
that they can create laws 
and push through legislation

1344
00:56:12,602 --> 00:56:15,071
that doesn't benefit 
Americans in any way

1345
00:56:15,071 --> 00:56:17,707
such as Ag-gag laws that 
criminalize whistle-blowing

1346
00:56:17,707 --> 00:56:20,243
or photographing abuses 
by this industry.

1347
00:56:20,243 --> 00:56:22,145
Activists in the US can 
be charged as terrorist

1348
00:56:22,145 --> 00:56:24,380
for disrupting the 
profits of any business

1349
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:27,584
that uses animals under the 
Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act

1350
00:56:27,584 --> 00:56:32,222
to the even more ridiculous 
ones like Cheeseburger Laws.

1351
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:33,823
- A Cheeseburger Law 
is a law that states

1352
00:56:33,823 --> 00:56:35,892
a plaintiff cannot 
recover against

1353
00:56:35,892 --> 00:56:37,961
a manufacturer, 
distributor, retailer

1354
00:56:37,961 --> 00:56:41,965
on the theory that the food 
made the plaintiff obese

1355
00:56:41,965 --> 00:56:44,934
or caused an 
obesity-related disease.

1356
00:56:44,934 --> 00:56:47,303
- Cheeseburger Law 
is a direct response

1357
00:56:47,303 --> 00:56:51,007
to a problem that the 
tobacco industry has had.

1358
00:56:51,007 --> 00:56:53,510
Big tobacco has paid 
400 billion dollars

1359
00:56:53,510 --> 00:56:55,378
to state medicated programs.

1360
00:56:55,378 --> 00:56:57,347
Cheeseburger Law, 
it's proponent say,

1361
00:56:57,347 --> 00:56:59,783
"We don't wanna see the 
same kind of thing happen

1362
00:56:59,783 --> 00:57:01,651
"to the meat and 
dairy industries."

1363
00:57:01,651 --> 00:57:04,087
The fact that these laws are 
based on a model template

1364
00:57:04,087 --> 00:57:07,624
called the Commonsense 
Consumption Act 
is actually ironic

1365
00:57:07,624 --> 00:57:09,092
because what they're saying is,

1366
00:57:09,092 --> 00:57:11,294
you the consumer should 
have a commonsense

1367
00:57:11,294 --> 00:57:13,963
to know that our 
food is bad for you.

1368
00:57:13,963 --> 00:57:17,167
- I've often typify the 
meat industry to people

1369
00:57:17,167 --> 00:57:20,537
who maybe don't understand 
its power and reach

1370
00:57:20,537 --> 00:57:24,507
as it's got all the money of 
big tobacco and big pharma

1371
00:57:24,507 --> 00:57:28,511
and has the personality of the 
National Rifle Association.

1372
00:57:28,511 --> 00:57:31,214
So, any little 
thing that comes up,

1373
00:57:31,214 --> 00:57:34,217
man, they beat it to death.

1374
00:57:34,217 --> 00:57:35,852
- [Kip] Robert Martin 
wasn't exaggerating.

1375
00:57:35,852 --> 00:57:38,054
When the profits of the ag 
industry were threatened

1376
00:57:38,054 --> 00:57:40,623
by ag alternative company, 
Hampton Creek Foods,

1377
00:57:40,623 --> 00:57:43,092
extremely disturbing 
emails were uncovered

1378
00:57:43,092 --> 00:57:45,228
by Ryan Shapiro 
and Jeffrey Light.

1379
00:57:45,228 --> 00:57:47,931
- We uncovered documents 
demonstrating the 
American Ag Port

1380
00:57:47,931 --> 00:57:51,901
considers Hampton Creek, quote, 
a crisis and a major threat

1381
00:57:51,901 --> 00:57:54,270
to the future of the 
American ag industry.

1382
00:57:54,270 --> 00:57:55,738
The American Ag Board considers

1383
00:57:55,738 --> 00:57:58,675
a successful ag replacer 
company to be such a threat

1384
00:57:58,675 --> 00:58:01,644
that they joke under 
government email addresses

1385
00:58:01,644 --> 00:58:04,047
about murdering the CEO.

1386
00:58:04,047 --> 00:58:05,515
- [Kip] In internal 
government emails

1387
00:58:05,515 --> 00:58:07,283
with the heads of 
the ag industry,

1388
00:58:07,283 --> 00:58:09,819
they suggest having the 
CEO of Hampton Creek,

1389
00:58:09,819 --> 00:58:12,455
Josh Tetric, murdered,

1390
00:58:12,455 --> 00:58:14,791
including a menacing email 
from executive director

1391
00:58:14,791 --> 00:58:16,893
of the American Ag Board.

1392
00:58:21,731 --> 00:58:25,501
- The meat producers don't have 
to pay for the heart disease

1393
00:58:25,501 --> 00:58:27,704
and the environmental 
destruction

1394
00:58:27,704 --> 00:58:32,175
or any of the other 
externalities as 
economists call them

1395
00:58:32,175 --> 00:58:34,978
that their products cause.

1396
00:58:34,978 --> 00:58:36,212
- You know, then 
there's the whole

1397
00:58:36,212 --> 00:58:37,747
pharmaceutical aspect of it

1398
00:58:37,747 --> 00:58:39,048
and the fact that 
there's a very strong

1399
00:58:39,048 --> 00:58:40,850
pharmaceutical industry in lobby

1400
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:44,120
that has a huge stake at 
preserving the status quo.

1401
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:46,923
- These chronic diseases, 
these are the cash cows

1402
00:58:46,923 --> 00:58:48,491
of the pharmaceutical industry.

1403
00:58:48,491 --> 00:58:51,094
- We have a five billion 
dollar stent industry.

1404
00:58:51,094 --> 00:58:52,762
Do they ever wanna 
see that go away?

1405
00:58:52,762 --> 00:58:55,732
We've had 35 billion dollar 
statin drug industry.

1406
00:58:55,732 --> 00:58:57,300
Do they ever wanna 
see that go away?

1407
00:58:57,300 --> 00:58:58,701
- I'm talking about the 
pharmaceutical industry

1408
00:58:58,701 --> 00:59:01,771
effectively controls 
what doctors are told.

1409
00:59:01,771 --> 00:59:03,840
- Most research isn't 
put into prevention,

1410
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:05,875
it's put into the medication

1411
00:59:05,875 --> 00:59:09,145
that we might use for 
that particular disease.

1412
00:59:09,145 --> 00:59:12,849
- I'm on two different high 
blood pressure medicines,

1413
00:59:12,849 --> 00:59:17,020
six asthma-type medicines, 
even after four years of shots,

1414
00:59:18,922 --> 00:59:21,758
and then another medicine to 
help take care of side effects

1415
00:59:21,758 --> 00:59:23,559
from some of those medicines.

1416
00:59:23,559 --> 00:59:26,396
I'm on high level 
antidepressants,

1417
00:59:27,864 --> 00:59:31,534
a couple of different pain 
meds for my back and hips.

1418
00:59:31,534 --> 00:59:34,237
- I'm taking about 16 drugs

1419
00:59:34,237 --> 00:59:36,506
not counting the 
insulin in the morning.

1420
00:59:36,506 --> 00:59:39,509
I take insulin morning, 
insulin at night,

1421
00:59:39,509 --> 00:59:42,111
like 32 to 34 units of insulin.

1422
00:59:44,247 --> 00:59:46,082
Lantus to be exact.

1423
00:59:46,082 --> 00:59:49,452
Some of these meds 
are for diabetes.

1424
00:59:49,452 --> 00:59:53,489
This is for pN, I have to 
use this for my prostate,

1425
00:59:53,489 --> 00:59:55,925
and then I have to 
use this for the heart

1426
00:59:55,925 --> 00:59:58,494
and I have to use this 
for blood pressure.

1427
00:59:58,494 --> 01:00:01,664
And it's just on and 
on and on and on.

1428
01:00:03,099 --> 01:00:04,867
The doctors are telling 
me this is what I gotta do

1429
01:00:04,867 --> 01:00:06,970
for my whole life 
and it's frustrating,

1430
01:00:06,970 --> 01:00:09,238
and it's very stressful.

1431
01:00:09,238 --> 01:00:11,474
I don't know how long 
my liver is gonna last

1432
01:00:11,474 --> 01:00:13,142
taking all these stuff.

1433
01:00:13,142 --> 01:00:14,477
- Under conventional 
medical treatment,

1434
01:00:14,477 --> 01:00:16,012
whether it be for 
autoimmune disease,

1435
01:00:16,012 --> 01:00:19,382
or even conditions like high 
blood pressure or diabetes,

1436
01:00:19,382 --> 01:00:22,218
you're told the you 
have to take drugs

1437
01:00:22,218 --> 01:00:25,054
and not just for a week 
or a month or a year,

1438
01:00:25,054 --> 01:00:27,824
you're told that you have 
to take drugs forever.

1439
01:00:27,824 --> 01:00:30,593
You're guaranteed that if you 
follow your doctor's advice,

1440
01:00:30,593 --> 01:00:34,364
you'll be sick forever, 
you'll never get well.

1441
01:00:34,364 --> 01:00:36,232
That's the guarantee.

1442
01:00:36,232 --> 01:00:39,469
Because the strategies 
are all about manipulating

1443
01:00:39,469 --> 01:00:42,205
the symptoms, not dealing 
with the underlying cause.

1444
01:00:42,205 --> 01:00:43,506
- You'll come in 
with that diagnosis.

1445
01:00:43,506 --> 01:00:45,441
You get a bunch of pills 
that have nothing to do

1446
01:00:45,441 --> 01:00:48,211
with the disease causation 
or you get this procedures

1447
01:00:48,211 --> 01:00:50,913
that have nothing to do 
with disease causation.

1448
01:00:50,913 --> 01:00:52,181
- It's a deception to say,

1449
01:00:52,181 --> 01:00:54,584
"This pill will help you 
unclog your arteries.

1450
01:00:54,584 --> 01:00:56,252
"This one will save 
you from stroke."

1451
01:00:56,252 --> 01:00:57,487
No, it doesn't.

1452
01:00:57,487 --> 01:00:58,888
The people who take 
the statins, et cetera,

1453
01:00:58,888 --> 01:01:00,390
they still get 
their heart attacks,

1454
01:01:00,390 --> 01:01:01,624
they still get their strokes,

1455
01:01:01,624 --> 01:01:03,059
this is not reversed disease,

1456
01:01:03,059 --> 01:01:05,061
this does not make 
plaque smaller.

1457
01:01:05,061 --> 01:01:07,764
This is a fun of 
massive proportions.

1458
01:01:07,764 --> 01:01:09,432
- [Kip] In the US, 
treating chronic these

1459
01:01:09,432 --> 01:01:11,701
such as heart disease, 
cancer, and diabetes

1460
01:01:11,701 --> 01:01:15,304
is a 1.5 trillion 
dollar industry.

1461
01:01:15,304 --> 01:01:16,906
That's the GDP equivalent

1462
01:01:16,906 --> 01:01:20,043
of the 10th richest 
country in the world.

1463
01:01:20,043 --> 01:01:21,210
I went back and dug deeper

1464
01:01:21,210 --> 01:01:23,179
into the health 
organizations funding

1465
01:01:23,179 --> 01:01:25,448
and there it was again.

1466
01:01:25,448 --> 01:01:27,717
These organizations were 
accepting millions of dollars

1467
01:01:27,717 --> 01:01:29,385
from pharmaceutical companies

1468
01:01:29,385 --> 01:01:31,020
that are making 
billions of dollars

1469
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:33,089
from the very same diseases 
these health groups

1470
01:01:33,089 --> 01:01:35,324
are supposedly trying to end.

1471
01:01:35,324 --> 01:01:37,593
It seemed like a major 
conflict of interest

1472
01:01:37,593 --> 01:01:40,863
unless ending these diseases 
isn't really the goal.

1473
01:01:40,863 --> 01:01:42,665
The pharmaceutical 
industry spends more money

1474
01:01:42,665 --> 01:01:45,301
on lobbying than any 
other single industry.

1475
01:01:45,301 --> 01:01:47,470
Just like animal agriculture, 
they are so powerful,

1476
01:01:47,470 --> 01:01:48,971
they write their own laws

1477
01:01:48,971 --> 01:01:51,207
that have had activists 
imprisoned to silence them.

1478
01:01:51,207 --> 01:01:54,077
- Government's embed with 
anyone that goes in the money.

1479
01:01:54,077 --> 01:01:55,411
Just pharmaceutical industry

1480
01:01:55,411 --> 01:01:57,747
which is the animal 
ag industries.

1481
01:01:57,747 --> 01:02:00,583
They are pumping the government 
full of money and resources

1482
01:02:00,583 --> 01:02:02,652
and in return, the governments 
giving them what they want,

1483
01:02:02,652 --> 01:02:06,355
subsidies, imprisoning 
activists that go against them,

1484
01:02:06,355 --> 01:02:08,357
and I think it's quite 
telling that these industries

1485
01:02:08,357 --> 01:02:11,794
are working so hard in 
spending so much money

1486
01:02:11,794 --> 01:02:14,797
to criminalize people for 
simply taking a picture,

1487
01:02:14,797 --> 01:02:16,899
for simply recording 
what's going on inside

1488
01:02:16,899 --> 01:02:20,036
of these facilities and 
making it known to the public.

1489
01:02:20,036 --> 01:02:21,404
They're behind walls.

1490
01:02:21,404 --> 01:02:22,972
They're underground.

1491
01:02:22,972 --> 01:02:25,341
They're in these 
secret facilities that 
no one knows about

1492
01:02:25,341 --> 01:02:27,210
but if they did, they would 
be shocked and outraged

1493
01:02:27,210 --> 01:02:29,212
and I think people 
would not want to think

1494
01:02:29,212 --> 01:02:31,914
that their pharmaceuticals, 
that their food

1495
01:02:31,914 --> 01:02:33,549
are coming from these places

1496
01:02:33,549 --> 01:02:35,151
and that's why, I 
think, it's such...

1497
01:02:35,151 --> 01:02:36,819
The Ag-gag laws 
are what they are

1498
01:02:36,819 --> 01:02:39,188
is because they are 
trying to silence people

1499
01:02:39,188 --> 01:02:41,824
into not speaking out and 
not showing the truth.

1500
01:02:41,824 --> 01:02:43,559
- [Kip] I finally realized 
how deep the occlusion

1501
01:02:43,559 --> 01:02:46,429
truly is between government 
and these industries

1502
01:02:46,429 --> 01:02:48,664
and how dangerous it 
could be to expose them.

1503
01:02:48,664 --> 01:02:50,600
These concerns 
intensified after meeting

1504
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:53,469
the USDA whistleblower who 
revealed mad cow disease

1505
01:02:53,469 --> 01:02:54,904
in the US meat supplier.

1506
01:02:54,904 --> 01:02:56,172
- [Mad Cow Disease 
Whistleblower] USDA operates

1507
01:02:56,172 --> 01:02:57,940
like the military 
so when I got on TV,

1508
01:02:57,940 --> 01:03:00,009
right away you see set of memos

1509
01:03:00,009 --> 01:03:02,111
to all the veterinarians 
and food inspectors.

1510
01:03:02,111 --> 01:03:04,514
"If anybody from the 
media ever contacts you,

1511
01:03:04,514 --> 01:03:08,151
"do not talk to them, 
refer to Washington, DC

1512
01:03:08,151 --> 01:03:10,319
"and we will talk to them."

1513
01:03:10,319 --> 01:03:12,054
So, right away 
shut up everybody.

1514
01:03:12,054 --> 01:03:15,391
The American public are very, 
very concerned about this,

1515
01:03:15,391 --> 01:03:16,993
what's going on with the USDA.

1516
01:03:16,993 --> 01:03:18,327
Here in the United States,

1517
01:03:18,327 --> 01:03:21,297
we have at least four 
cases of mad cow disease

1518
01:03:21,297 --> 01:03:23,799
but I'm almost positive 
there's more cases of that

1519
01:03:23,799 --> 01:03:25,668
that the government 
is looking for.

1520
01:03:25,668 --> 01:03:26,969
- [Kip] So, what you're 
saying is that there could be

1521
01:03:26,969 --> 01:03:29,405
already mad cow 
disease in humans?

1522
01:03:29,405 --> 01:03:32,074
- Right, and I think a lot 
of it was misdiagnosed.

1523
01:03:32,074 --> 01:03:33,776
The Alzheimer's or dementia

1524
01:03:33,776 --> 01:03:36,312
that takes several years 
to see the progression

1525
01:03:36,312 --> 01:03:37,847
but to make it easier,

1526
01:03:37,847 --> 01:03:40,149
these doctors just sign off on 
it as dementia or Alzheimer's

1527
01:03:40,149 --> 01:03:41,751
while they should've 
taken a biopsy

1528
01:03:41,751 --> 01:03:43,352
of the brain to see if it's that

1529
01:03:43,352 --> 01:03:45,755
or is it actually 
a prion disease

1530
01:03:45,755 --> 01:03:48,958
like Creutzfeldt-Jakob 
disease or mad cow disease.

1531
01:03:48,958 --> 01:03:51,294
- [Kip] Do you think 
it's safe to eat meat?

1532
01:03:51,294 --> 01:03:53,596
- I personally don't 
think it's safe to eat it

1533
01:03:53,596 --> 01:03:56,566
because of the fact how the 
line speeds are increasing

1534
01:03:56,566 --> 01:03:59,635
and also our inspectors are 
not well-trained enough.

1535
01:03:59,635 --> 01:04:01,571
At the present time, 
the ones we know

1536
01:04:01,571 --> 01:04:04,106
is going about 220 cows an hour.

1537
01:04:04,106 --> 01:04:07,009
That gives you about, somewhere 
around four cows per minute

1538
01:04:07,009 --> 01:04:09,412
so that's 15 seconds per cow.

1539
01:04:10,613 --> 01:04:11,914
- [Kip] This dangerous 
slaughter speeds means

1540
01:04:11,914 --> 01:04:14,584
that animal waste 
ends up everywhere.

1541
01:04:14,584 --> 01:04:16,686
Testing shows 88% of pork chops

1542
01:04:16,686 --> 01:04:19,055
are contaminated 
with fecal bacteria.

1543
01:04:19,055 --> 01:04:22,491
90% of ground beef and 95% 
of chicken breasts sample

1544
01:04:22,491 --> 01:04:24,827
contain animal waste bacteria.

1545
01:04:24,827 --> 01:04:28,064
There is nothing clean 
about eating this way

1546
01:04:28,064 --> 01:04:32,301
but it just isn't waste, it's 
also pus-filled infections.

1547
01:04:32,301 --> 01:04:33,803
- [Mad Cow Disease 
Whistleblower] You can see

1548
01:04:33,803 --> 01:04:36,505
there's a bump or some kind 
of abcess underneath the hind.

1549
01:04:36,505 --> 01:04:38,608
Most of the time, when 
the hind's pulled off,

1550
01:04:38,608 --> 01:04:41,244
either that will 
open up the abcess

1551
01:04:41,244 --> 01:04:42,712
and the pus will come out

1552
01:04:42,712 --> 01:04:44,981
or if it's deep-seated 
when the inspectors

1553
01:04:44,981 --> 01:04:47,350
are doing their work 
or company employees,

1554
01:04:47,350 --> 01:04:49,819
they might stick their 
knife into an abcess

1555
01:04:49,819 --> 01:04:53,222
and that explodes 
all over the place.

1556
01:04:53,222 --> 01:04:54,390
- [Kip] I had heard enough.

1557
01:04:54,390 --> 01:04:56,325
I was utterly disgusted 
by the corruption,

1558
01:04:56,325 --> 01:04:59,895
the greed, the disease, and 
the abuse I was learning about.

1559
01:04:59,895 --> 01:05:01,797
The very animals we are killing

1560
01:05:01,797 --> 01:05:03,733
were killing us in the planet

1561
01:05:03,733 --> 01:05:05,968
but so many people 
are even eating dairy

1562
01:05:05,968 --> 01:05:07,503
every day of their lives.

1563
01:05:07,503 --> 01:05:10,239
And we are so concerned 
about getting enough protein.

1564
01:05:10,239 --> 01:05:12,875
Do we have to eat meat 
to get complete protein?

1565
01:05:12,875 --> 01:05:15,478
- Oh my god, oh my god.

1566
01:05:15,478 --> 01:05:17,980
You want me to jump of 
this building, don't you?

1567
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:22,585
Well, first of all, all 
protein is made by plants.

1568
01:05:22,585 --> 01:05:24,487
I'll state that 
again for the record.

1569
01:05:24,487 --> 01:05:27,790
All protein is initially 
made by plants, all of it,

1570
01:05:27,790 --> 01:05:31,494
and it is not necessary 
to eat animal tissue

1571
01:05:31,494 --> 01:05:33,329
in order to get protein.

1572
01:05:33,329 --> 01:05:37,266
Only plants have the ability 
to actually take nitrogen

1573
01:05:37,266 --> 01:05:39,902
from the air, break 
those molecules apart,

1574
01:05:39,902 --> 01:05:41,237
and incorporate that nitrogen

1575
01:05:41,237 --> 01:05:44,407
into amino acids and 
then make protein.

1576
01:05:44,407 --> 01:05:45,941
Any protein you 
get from an animal

1577
01:05:45,941 --> 01:05:48,244
is simply recycled 
plant protein.

1578
01:05:48,244 --> 01:05:51,247
- If you eat a diet that 
was calorically adequate

1579
01:05:51,247 --> 01:05:53,182
and even things like 
brown rice and broccoli

1580
01:05:53,182 --> 01:05:54,617
and you got enough of it.

1581
01:05:54,617 --> 01:05:57,219
You'd get enough both quantity 
and quality of protein.

1582
01:05:57,219 --> 01:05:59,155
2,000 calories of 
brown rice and broccoli

1583
01:05:59,155 --> 01:06:01,157
is gonna be about 80 
grams of protein a day

1584
01:06:01,157 --> 01:06:03,025
including the 
essential amino acids

1585
01:06:03,025 --> 01:06:05,761
that you need in order to 
maintain optimum health.

1586
01:06:05,761 --> 01:06:07,830
- I mean, the grains 
are loaded with protein.

1587
01:06:07,830 --> 01:06:09,632
Beans are loaded with protein.

1588
01:06:09,632 --> 01:06:12,034
Vegetables are 
loaded with protein.

1589
01:06:12,034 --> 01:06:15,137
- You really want to get 
your protein from plants

1590
01:06:15,137 --> 01:06:18,641
because plant proteins have 
a much more beneficial effect

1591
01:06:18,641 --> 01:06:20,142
on our physiology.

1592
01:06:20,142 --> 01:06:22,044
- The funny thing about 
protein is most Americans

1593
01:06:22,044 --> 01:06:24,146
get about twice the 
amount they need.

1594
01:06:24,146 --> 01:06:25,715
Most Americans are getting less

1595
01:06:25,715 --> 01:06:27,917
than half the amount 
of fiber they need

1596
01:06:27,917 --> 01:06:30,019
but the conversation tends 
to always be about protein.

1597
01:06:30,019 --> 01:06:33,122
So, my mind, it's just this 
magical marketing campaign

1598
01:06:33,122 --> 01:06:35,558
that protein has taken 
on over are decades.

1599
01:06:35,558 --> 01:06:37,393
- The question is not 
where to get your protein,

1600
01:06:37,393 --> 01:06:39,161
it's really where do 
you get your fiber?

1601
01:06:39,161 --> 01:06:41,464
- I've never in my 
professional career

1602
01:06:41,464 --> 01:06:42,865
seen a protein deficiency.

1603
01:06:42,865 --> 01:06:44,166
I've never seen someone come in,

1604
01:06:44,166 --> 01:06:46,035
eating normal 
amounts of calories

1605
01:06:46,035 --> 01:06:47,436
and their protein deficient.

1606
01:06:47,436 --> 01:06:48,904
You just don't see that.

1607
01:06:48,904 --> 01:06:52,475
- So, human milk has the 
lowest protein content ever

1608
01:06:52,475 --> 01:06:54,610
in any species ever tested.

1609
01:06:54,610 --> 01:06:57,580
That's the fluid that's 
been designed by evolution

1610
01:06:57,580 --> 01:06:59,115
over millions of years.

1611
01:06:59,115 --> 01:07:03,219
That's like the perfect food 
for human babies, right?

1612
01:07:03,219 --> 01:07:06,989
Perfect food, lowest protein 
content any other mammal.

1613
01:07:06,989 --> 01:07:09,759
So, it gives a sense of 
protein requirements for--

1614
01:07:10,793 --> 01:07:11,627
Anything.

1615
01:07:11,627 --> 01:07:12,862
- [Kip] Like unit.

1616
01:07:12,862 --> 01:07:15,398
- Than rat milk, ape milk-- 
- Really?

1617
01:07:15,398 --> 01:07:17,967
- Donkey milk, any milk 
that's ever been tested.

1618
01:07:17,967 --> 01:07:19,502
- You hear this a 
lot in body builders.

1619
01:07:19,502 --> 01:07:24,273
Well, I need a chicken or 
I need fish to be strong,

1620
01:07:24,273 --> 01:07:25,474
to build muscle tissue.

1621
01:07:25,474 --> 01:07:27,410
That is utter nonsense.

1622
01:07:27,410 --> 01:07:31,080
The largest, strongest 
terrestrial animals 
on the planet

1623
01:07:31,080 --> 01:07:32,548
are all herbivores.

1624
01:07:32,548 --> 01:07:35,151
The biggest, strongest 
animals are all herbivores.

1625
01:07:35,151 --> 01:07:37,920
- When we bring in people 
and they're on meaty diets

1626
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:39,588
and we transition them 
to a plant-based diet,

1627
01:07:39,588 --> 01:07:40,923
we always track 
what their eating.

1628
01:07:40,923 --> 01:07:43,192
Their vitamin intake goes up.

1629
01:07:43,192 --> 01:07:46,195
Their nutrition overall 
goes up dramatically better

1630
01:07:46,195 --> 01:07:48,697
and these same people 
might worry in advance,

1631
01:07:48,697 --> 01:07:50,466
"Will I get the 
nutrition that I need

1632
01:07:50,466 --> 01:07:51,567
"on a plant-based diet?"

1633
01:07:51,567 --> 01:07:53,235
The fact is, you're not getting

1634
01:07:53,235 --> 01:07:55,104
the nutrition you need 
on a meat-based diet

1635
01:07:55,104 --> 01:07:56,539
and you're gonna 
get dramatically

1636
01:07:56,539 --> 01:07:58,307
better nutrition on 
a plant-based diet.

1637
01:07:58,307 --> 01:08:00,943
- For an average-sized 
guy like myself,

1638
01:08:00,943 --> 01:08:04,313
I need about 56 grams of 
protein a day, that's optimum.

1639
01:08:04,313 --> 01:08:06,782
Probably, I really need 
30 to 40 grams a day.

1640
01:08:06,782 --> 01:08:08,350
Diets are really 
high on these protein

1641
01:08:08,350 --> 01:08:12,188
create diabetes, create 
heart disease, create cancer,

1642
01:08:12,188 --> 01:08:15,191
create the diseases that I'm 
treating on a daily basis.

1643
01:08:15,191 --> 01:08:16,358
- [Kip] But this is the opposite

1644
01:08:16,358 --> 01:08:18,694
of all the high 
protein diet fads say.

1645
01:08:18,694 --> 01:08:20,963
- The food you eat 
determines the bacteria

1646
01:08:20,963 --> 01:08:22,231
that live in your gut.

1647
01:08:22,231 --> 01:08:24,166
While you eat animal 
flesh every day,

1648
01:08:24,166 --> 01:08:28,471
you are summoning up 
bacteria that eat carnitine

1649
01:08:28,471 --> 01:08:31,140
and those bacteria will 
turn that carnitine

1650
01:08:31,140 --> 01:08:34,076
into a molecule 
called trimethylamine.

1651
01:08:34,076 --> 01:08:37,580
Your liver then turns that 
into trimethylamine oxide.

1652
01:08:37,580 --> 01:08:39,114
That's a molecule from hell.

1653
01:08:39,114 --> 01:08:42,418
That molecule drives cholesterol 
into the artery walls

1654
01:08:42,418 --> 01:08:45,387
and the people who are 
consuming this flesh-based diet

1655
01:08:45,387 --> 01:08:47,756
are tripping to 
plaque building up.

1656
01:08:47,756 --> 01:08:50,059
They may lose weight on 
this diet and that's good

1657
01:08:50,059 --> 01:08:53,462
but what's happening inside 
your arteries paleo friends?

1658
01:08:53,462 --> 01:08:55,698
What's happening is that 
plaque is building up

1659
01:08:55,698 --> 01:08:58,400
and these are folks who 
drop dead at the gym at 39.

1660
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:00,536
Boo, he was lean and 
he looked really good

1661
01:09:00,536 --> 01:09:02,771
but where is that 
cholesterol going?

1662
01:09:02,771 --> 01:09:04,306
It's going to your artery walls.

1663
01:09:04,306 --> 01:09:08,010
So, I believe in this paleo 
folks are setting themselves up

1664
01:09:08,010 --> 01:09:11,914
for an epidemic of clogged 
arteries, colon cancers,

1665
01:09:11,914 --> 01:09:15,351
autoimmune diseases, this 
is not a healthy diet.

1666
01:09:15,351 --> 01:09:17,219
We are not carnivorous apes.

1667
01:09:17,219 --> 01:09:19,455
- [Kip] Humans' closest 
living relatives are chimps

1668
01:09:19,455 --> 01:09:21,824
who get 97% of their 
calories from plants

1669
01:09:21,824 --> 01:09:24,493
and the remaining 3% 
mostly from insects.

1670
01:09:24,493 --> 01:09:26,795
Comparing the anatomy of 
true omnivores like bears

1671
01:09:26,795 --> 01:09:29,765
who eat both meat and plants 
to frugivores like primates

1672
01:09:29,765 --> 01:09:31,734
who eat almost 
exclusively plants,

1673
01:09:31,734 --> 01:09:33,502
the differences 
are pretty clear.

1674
01:09:33,502 --> 01:09:35,571
Frugivore teeth have flat 
molars for chewing plants

1675
01:09:35,571 --> 01:09:37,139
where omnivore 
teeth are serrated

1676
01:09:37,139 --> 01:09:39,174
for stabbing and tearing flesh.

1677
01:09:39,174 --> 01:09:40,676
Frugivore jaws can move forward

1678
01:09:40,676 --> 01:09:41,877
and back and side to side.

1679
01:09:41,877 --> 01:09:43,879
Omnivore jaws cannot.

1680
01:09:43,879 --> 01:09:45,881
Omnivores have much 
stronger stomach acid

1681
01:09:45,881 --> 01:09:47,349
for digesting meat

1682
01:09:47,349 --> 01:09:49,485
compared to less acidic 
stomach acid of frugivores.

1683
01:09:49,485 --> 01:09:52,555
The intestines of frugivores 
is nine times their body length

1684
01:09:52,555 --> 01:09:54,456
compared to three 
times for omnivores.

1685
01:09:54,456 --> 01:09:56,659
This is because meat will 
putrify in the gut less

1686
01:09:56,659 --> 01:09:58,160
as it moved through it quickly.

1687
01:09:58,160 --> 01:10:00,629
If humans were indeed true 
omnivores, we would need

1688
01:10:00,629 --> 01:10:03,532
to change our physiology 
and appearance quite a lot

1689
01:10:03,532 --> 01:10:06,769
but we fit every 
requirement of a frugivore.

1690
01:10:06,769 --> 01:10:08,137
We may behave like omnivores

1691
01:10:08,137 --> 01:10:10,673
but anatomically, 
we're frugivores.

1692
01:10:10,673 --> 01:10:12,908
- Human beings, unlike 
bears and raccoons

1693
01:10:12,908 --> 01:10:14,577
and to some extent dogs,

1694
01:10:14,577 --> 01:10:18,280
don't have that mixed 
anatomy and physiology

1695
01:10:18,280 --> 01:10:20,049
that you see in 
the true omnivores

1696
01:10:20,049 --> 01:10:22,151
and thus, we are 
not true omnivores.

1697
01:10:22,151 --> 01:10:25,788
In humans, the canines 
have become really small

1698
01:10:25,788 --> 01:10:30,025
and rounded and 
actually function like 
accessory incisors.

1699
01:10:30,025 --> 01:10:31,827
They're utterly 
useless for ripping

1700
01:10:31,827 --> 01:10:34,229
and tearing anything 
other than the envelope.

1701
01:10:34,229 --> 01:10:37,700
So, the idea that the mere 
presence of the canine

1702
01:10:37,700 --> 01:10:40,669
somehow means that 
we're supposed to 
eat meat, it's silly.

1703
01:10:40,669 --> 01:10:41,904
- [Kip] He was right.

1704
01:10:41,904 --> 01:10:43,339
I always tell my 
canines were from me

1705
01:10:43,339 --> 01:10:45,107
but what kind of animal 
could I actually kill

1706
01:10:45,107 --> 01:10:47,776
and eat raw with 
these tiny teeth?

1707
01:10:47,776 --> 01:10:49,778
The thought alone 
was disgusting.

1708
01:10:49,778 --> 01:10:51,380
- I mean everybody 
loves a smoothie

1709
01:10:51,380 --> 01:10:54,049
made with fruit and 
even some vegetables

1710
01:10:54,049 --> 01:10:55,918
but if you think 
about putting a fish

1711
01:10:55,918 --> 01:11:00,255
or a piece of beef in the 
blender and grinding it up.

1712
01:11:00,255 --> 01:11:03,025
The thought is 
absolutely repulsive.

1713
01:11:03,025 --> 01:11:04,727
- [Kip] All these 
diseases I'd learned about

1714
01:11:04,727 --> 01:11:07,129
were from eating a diet our 
body wasn't designed for.

1715
01:11:07,129 --> 01:11:09,031
What would happen if we 
started eating a diet

1716
01:11:09,031 --> 01:11:11,400
our body actually 
was designed for?

1717
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:12,901
- The data is crystal clear

1718
01:11:12,901 --> 01:11:15,537
that you can stop and 
reverse heart disease

1719
01:11:15,537 --> 01:11:17,039
with plant-based diets.

1720
01:11:17,039 --> 01:11:20,142
Scientifically shown, I've 
seen in my own patients.

1721
01:11:20,142 --> 01:11:22,311
- People who adopt 
low-fat plant-based diets

1722
01:11:22,311 --> 01:11:24,380
can actually reverse 
their heart disease

1723
01:11:24,380 --> 01:11:26,682
and that literally means 
watching the plaques

1724
01:11:26,682 --> 01:11:29,618
start to go away, something 
they didn't think could happen.

1725
01:11:29,618 --> 01:11:31,253
- My experience with patients is

1726
01:11:31,253 --> 01:11:33,022
and the studies show 
that when people adopt

1727
01:11:33,022 --> 01:11:35,357
the fully plant-based diet, 
their cholesterol levels

1728
01:11:35,357 --> 01:11:36,825
plummet within a few days

1729
01:11:36,825 --> 01:11:38,494
and if you do blood tests 
in a couple of weeks,

1730
01:11:38,494 --> 01:11:40,296
you'll see dramatic 
improvements.

1731
01:11:40,296 --> 01:11:41,930
- Yes, your numbers 
are gonna look great

1732
01:11:41,930 --> 01:11:43,198
within a week or two.

1733
01:11:43,198 --> 01:11:44,633
Your cholesterol can 
come crashing down.

1734
01:11:44,633 --> 01:11:46,168
In fact, if you're 
on medications,

1735
01:11:46,168 --> 01:11:47,169
your doctor may have to pull off

1736
01:11:47,169 --> 01:11:48,737
your blood pressure medications

1737
01:11:48,737 --> 01:11:50,472
so your blood pressure 
don't drop too low

1738
01:11:50,472 --> 01:11:52,174
because it can work too good.

1739
01:11:52,174 --> 01:11:55,144
The side effect is not 
having to take drugs.

1740
01:11:55,144 --> 01:11:57,446
- [Kip] In a groundbreaking 
study published by Dr. Esselstyn

1741
01:11:57,446 --> 01:12:00,416
following patients suffering 
from cardiovascular disease,

1742
01:12:00,416 --> 01:12:04,520
99.4% were able to avoid 
major cardiac events

1743
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:06,188
by going plant-based.

1744
01:12:06,188 --> 01:12:07,890
- Because it's not 
just heart disease.

1745
01:12:07,890 --> 01:12:10,626
It's hypertension, it's 
diabetes, it's strokes,

1746
01:12:10,626 --> 01:12:14,396
it's heart attacks, it's several 
of the autoimmune diseases,

1747
01:12:14,396 --> 01:12:17,232
lupus, asthma, 
GERD, osteoporosis.

1748
01:12:18,500 --> 01:12:21,303
I mean, there's a 
multitude of diseases.

1749
01:12:21,303 --> 01:12:22,638
Even rheumatoid arthritis.

1750
01:12:22,638 --> 01:12:23,906
It's gonna be so dramatic.

1751
01:12:23,906 --> 01:12:25,407
When you see these poor souls

1752
01:12:25,407 --> 01:12:27,443
who are just absolutely crippled

1753
01:12:27,443 --> 01:12:29,445
with rheumatoid 
arthritis go plant-based,

1754
01:12:29,445 --> 01:12:32,347
then they come off 
their medication.

1755
01:12:32,347 --> 01:12:34,083
- I wanted to follow 
up with Jane Chapman

1756
01:12:34,083 --> 01:12:36,418
who had been suffering 
if severe osteoarthritis,

1757
01:12:36,418 --> 01:12:39,788
and I could not believe what 
I saw after only a few weeks

1758
01:12:39,788 --> 01:12:42,324
of fasting and 
changing her diet.

1759
01:12:42,324 --> 01:12:44,126
- So amazing to 
see you like this--

1760
01:12:44,126 --> 01:12:45,627
- I know. 
- Only a few weeks later.

1761
01:12:45,627 --> 01:12:49,031
- I know, from going 
from the walker,

1762
01:12:49,031 --> 01:12:52,401
needing wheelchair 
assistance at the airport

1763
01:12:52,401 --> 01:12:55,270
to strolling down the street,

1764
01:12:55,270 --> 01:12:59,308
enjoying the fresh air 
and the sunshine...

1765
01:12:59,308 --> 01:13:02,811
Two weeks is all it took, two 
weeks to get off all the meds

1766
01:13:02,811 --> 01:13:06,148
and start to feel 
the inflammation

1767
01:13:06,148 --> 01:13:08,817
just drained out of the body

1768
01:13:08,817 --> 01:13:11,754
where the movement 
was much easier,

1769
01:13:12,955 --> 01:13:15,891
just a lot of healing 
occurred very rapidly

1770
01:13:15,891 --> 01:13:18,393
just by doing the right 
things for your body.

1771
01:13:18,393 --> 01:13:21,530
- When you're treating 
diseases with drugs,

1772
01:13:21,530 --> 01:13:23,432
there's one drug you 
take for cholesterol,

1773
01:13:23,432 --> 01:13:25,901
a different class of drugs to 
take for high blood pressure,

1774
01:13:25,901 --> 01:13:28,237
different class of drugs 
you take for diabetes,

1775
01:13:28,237 --> 01:13:30,272
but with diet, a 
plant-based diet,

1776
01:13:30,272 --> 01:13:34,510
affects all these diseases, 
one diet rules them all.

1777
01:13:34,510 --> 01:13:35,844
- [Kip] The impacts 
of eating this way

1778
01:13:35,844 --> 01:13:37,146
go far beyond ourselves.

1779
01:13:37,146 --> 01:13:39,014
By getting rid of 
heart disease alone,

1780
01:13:39,014 --> 01:13:42,084
we would save up to 48 
trillion dollars in the USA,

1781
01:13:42,084 --> 01:13:44,553
three times the US GDP.

1782
01:13:44,553 --> 01:13:46,054
- Conditions like 
high blood pressure,

1783
01:13:46,054 --> 01:13:48,690
you don't have to take the 
drugs for rest of your life

1784
01:13:48,690 --> 01:13:50,192
and be sick forever.

1785
01:13:50,192 --> 01:13:52,161
What you can do is live in 
such a way that it gives

1786
01:13:52,161 --> 01:13:53,862
the body a chance 
to heal itself.

1787
01:13:53,862 --> 01:13:57,399
We took 174 consecutive patients 
with high blood pressure

1788
01:13:57,399 --> 01:13:59,601
and 174 people 
were able to lower

1789
01:13:59,601 --> 01:14:00,836
their blood pressure enough

1790
01:14:00,836 --> 01:14:02,638
to eliminate the 
need for medication.

1791
01:14:02,638 --> 01:14:05,040
- For inflammatory bowel 
disease like Crohn's,

1792
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:07,709
the best remission 
rates ever achieved

1793
01:14:07,709 --> 01:14:10,445
through plant-based diet, 
MS, multiple sclerosis.

1794
01:14:10,445 --> 01:14:13,115
The best results ever 
achieved compared

1795
01:14:13,115 --> 01:14:15,517
to any medical-surgical, 
any kind of intervention,

1796
01:14:15,517 --> 01:14:17,019
was a plant-based diet.

1797
01:14:17,019 --> 01:14:19,321
- You can see that with 
every sequential reduction

1798
01:14:19,321 --> 01:14:22,024
in animal products, 
people live longer,

1799
01:14:22,024 --> 01:14:24,026
they have less heart disease, 
they have less cancer,

1800
01:14:24,026 --> 01:14:25,327
they have less diabetes.

1801
01:14:25,327 --> 01:14:26,995
- You can actually 
take human cancer cells

1802
01:14:26,995 --> 01:14:28,263
and put 'em in a Petri dish,

1803
01:14:28,263 --> 01:14:30,232
you can drip the blood 
of those eating vegan,

1804
01:14:30,232 --> 01:14:33,001
get about 72% suppression

1805
01:14:33,001 --> 01:14:36,038
in human prostate cancer 
cell growth in vitro.

1806
01:14:36,038 --> 01:14:39,107
They want to try this again 
with women in breast cancer,

1807
01:14:39,107 --> 01:14:40,709
said, "Let's see what a 
plant-based diet can do."

1808
01:14:40,709 --> 01:14:43,245
After just two weeks, 
their bodies cleaned up.

1809
01:14:43,245 --> 01:14:46,448
You drip their blood on the 
same carpet of cancer cells,

1810
01:14:46,448 --> 01:14:48,250
you can clear off 
the whole plate.

1811
01:14:48,250 --> 01:14:50,319
This is after just two 
weeks eating healthy

1812
01:14:50,319 --> 01:14:51,587
which raised the question,

1813
01:14:51,587 --> 01:14:53,488
what kind of blood do 
we want in our bodies?

1814
01:14:53,488 --> 01:14:56,892
- My background is in industrial 
and systems engineering

1815
01:14:56,892 --> 01:15:00,395
and that was my career 
path for a long time

1816
01:15:00,395 --> 01:15:03,165
until I had thyroid cancer

1817
01:15:03,165 --> 01:15:06,568
and everything 
changed from there.

1818
01:15:06,568 --> 01:15:10,739
I decided that I wanted 
to try alternative methods

1819
01:15:11,874 --> 01:15:14,009
and treatments rather 
than have surgery

1820
01:15:14,009 --> 01:15:15,811
and have my thyroid removed

1821
01:15:15,811 --> 01:15:17,079
which meant I'd be 
on medication forever

1822
01:15:17,079 --> 01:15:18,614
and didn't want that.

1823
01:15:18,614 --> 01:15:21,583
I just started reading 
into how plant-based diet

1824
01:15:21,583 --> 01:15:25,120
can heal the body and it has 
worked for so many people.

1825
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:27,089
So, I immediately just switched

1826
01:15:27,089 --> 01:15:30,759
to a completely whole 
food plant-based diet.

1827
01:15:30,759 --> 01:15:33,929
After a year, the cancer 
was completely gone

1828
01:15:33,929 --> 01:15:37,032
and my thyroid had 
shrunk to normal size

1829
01:15:37,032 --> 01:15:40,035
and I was completely 
free of that.

1830
01:15:40,035 --> 01:15:41,536
- [Kip] This was 
tough to believe.

1831
01:15:41,536 --> 01:15:43,438
Couldn't this all just be 
from eating healthier though

1832
01:15:43,438 --> 01:15:44,873
like no sugar?

1833
01:15:44,873 --> 01:15:47,409
Turns out, Dr. Walter 
Kempner from Duke University

1834
01:15:47,409 --> 01:15:49,811
back in the 1940's 
was reversing some

1835
01:15:49,811 --> 01:15:52,481
of our worst killer 
diseases with diet alone

1836
01:15:52,481 --> 01:15:53,649
and the diet he was using

1837
01:15:53,649 --> 01:15:55,550
was not always 
strictly plant-based

1838
01:15:55,550 --> 01:15:59,621
but it was made up of white 
rice, fruit, and table sugar.

1839
01:15:59,621 --> 01:16:01,423
- And he was reversing diabetes,

1840
01:16:01,423 --> 01:16:03,592
he was reversing 
malignant hypertension,

1841
01:16:03,592 --> 01:16:06,728
reversing heart disease, 
the diabetic complications,

1842
01:16:06,728 --> 01:16:08,997
reversing diabetic blindness.

1843
01:16:08,997 --> 01:16:11,133
So, these people basically 
had death sentences,

1844
01:16:11,133 --> 01:16:14,069
went to him, and were 
given basically sugar.

1845
01:16:14,069 --> 01:16:16,204
You know, this horrible diet

1846
01:16:16,204 --> 01:16:19,207
but it was strictly plant-based.

1847
01:16:19,207 --> 01:16:20,642
- [Kip] If this 
information had been around

1848
01:16:20,642 --> 01:16:23,879
since the 1940's, why don't 
all doctors know this?

1849
01:16:23,879 --> 01:16:25,047
- We're not taught 
about the power

1850
01:16:25,047 --> 01:16:27,516
of food in medical school.

1851
01:16:27,516 --> 01:16:31,153
No one is taught that 
the changes that we make

1852
01:16:31,153 --> 01:16:34,489
with our diet are probably 
the single most powerful thing

1853
01:16:34,489 --> 01:16:36,692
we can do to 
determine our destiny.

1854
01:16:36,692 --> 01:16:38,327
It trumps our genetics.

1855
01:16:38,327 --> 01:16:39,928
- Why isn't your 
doctor telling this?

1856
01:16:39,928 --> 01:16:42,531
Odds are your doctor never 
learned any of these.

1857
01:16:42,531 --> 01:16:43,832
In fact, there is even 
a bill introduced,

1858
01:16:43,832 --> 01:16:45,167
just mandating physicians

1859
01:16:45,167 --> 01:16:47,102
to get seven hours 
of nutrition training

1860
01:16:47,102 --> 01:16:49,771
every couple of years just 
kinda stay on top of it

1861
01:16:49,771 --> 01:16:52,808
and who came out against that?

1862
01:16:52,808 --> 01:16:54,343
The California 
Medical Association.

1863
01:16:54,343 --> 01:16:56,078
Even the family 
physicians, the surgeons,

1864
01:16:56,078 --> 01:16:59,348
all the mainstream medical 
groups came out opposed.

1865
01:16:59,348 --> 01:17:01,483
- If seven hours, that's a lot.

1866
01:17:01,483 --> 01:17:03,752
Even if it's over 
one for your period.

1867
01:17:03,752 --> 01:17:05,687
- So, they're not just neutral

1868
01:17:05,687 --> 01:17:09,291
but they actually actively 
opposing nutrition education.

1869
01:17:09,291 --> 01:17:11,293
- Ironically, when patients 
come to doctors with questions,

1870
01:17:11,293 --> 01:17:14,029
they assume that the doctor 
knows something about nutrition

1871
01:17:14,029 --> 01:17:16,198
and so, it's kind of a 
double whammy that doctors

1872
01:17:16,198 --> 01:17:17,833
haven't been taught 
much about nutrition.

1873
01:17:17,833 --> 01:17:19,801
- [Kip] Why don't we hear 
about this from dieticians

1874
01:17:19,801 --> 01:17:22,170
where nutrition is 
their entire specialty?

1875
01:17:22,170 --> 01:17:24,473
Turns out, the 
American Nutrition and 
Dietetics Association

1876
01:17:24,473 --> 01:17:26,208
puts out a nutrition 
facts sheets

1877
01:17:26,208 --> 01:17:28,043
written by the 
industries themselves.

1878
01:17:28,043 --> 01:17:30,512
The industries pay 
$20,000 per fact sheet

1879
01:17:30,512 --> 01:17:32,848
and explicitly take 
part in writing them.

1880
01:17:32,848 --> 01:17:34,516
So, you can learn about 
eggs from the egg industry.

1881
01:17:34,516 --> 01:17:37,252
You can learn about lamb 
from the lamb industry.

1882
01:17:37,252 --> 01:17:39,454
This would be like learning 
about the benefits of smoking

1883
01:17:39,454 --> 01:17:41,189
from the tobacco industry.

1884
01:17:41,189 --> 01:17:42,858
- When people are eating meat,

1885
01:17:42,858 --> 01:17:44,726
I think of it as a 
bit like smoking.

1886
01:17:44,726 --> 01:17:46,828
It's sort of Russian Roulette.

1887
01:17:46,828 --> 01:17:48,330
You may not get diabetes

1888
01:17:48,330 --> 01:17:51,433
but your chances of getting 
diabetes, about one in three.

1889
01:17:51,433 --> 01:17:53,001
You may not get cancer 
but your chances

1890
01:17:53,001 --> 01:17:55,937
if you're a man, about one in 
two, a woman, one in three.

1891
01:17:55,937 --> 01:17:58,106
Your chances of gaining 
weight, two out of three.

1892
01:17:58,106 --> 01:18:00,142
It's not all diet 
but most of it is.

1893
01:18:00,142 --> 01:18:01,977
The best thing that 
you can do to make sure

1894
01:18:01,977 --> 01:18:05,080
that you empty those 
bullets out of the chamber

1895
01:18:05,080 --> 01:18:06,715
and not taking risk 
with your health,

1896
01:18:06,715 --> 01:18:08,984
is to get the animal 
products out of your diet

1897
01:18:08,984 --> 01:18:11,286
and eat healthy foods.

1898
01:18:11,286 --> 01:18:14,122
- I came to TrueNorth to 
help me with my asthma

1899
01:18:14,122 --> 01:18:16,658
and to lose a little 
weight and it's amazing,

1900
01:18:16,658 --> 01:18:18,727
just in two weeks 
of changing my diet,

1901
01:18:18,727 --> 01:18:22,431
don't have to take 
any asthma medication,

1902
01:18:22,431 --> 01:18:26,468
no anti-depressants, 
no pain medication,

1903
01:18:26,468 --> 01:18:30,572
no heart medication, nothing, 
no medications at all.

1904
01:18:30,572 --> 01:18:33,942
And it's really, 
it's just incredible.

1905
01:18:33,942 --> 01:18:37,345
I was taking Oxy 
and Advil and...

1906
01:18:37,345 --> 01:18:40,215
I was taking 800 milligrams 
of Motrin three times a day

1907
01:18:40,215 --> 01:18:42,017
just to get through the day

1908
01:18:42,017 --> 01:18:43,819
because I was in so much pain.

1909
01:18:43,819 --> 01:18:45,454
And now, nothing.

1910
01:18:45,454 --> 01:18:46,455
- Wow. 
- Nothing at all.

1911
01:18:46,455 --> 01:18:47,289
- Two weeks?

1912
01:18:47,289 --> 01:18:48,890
- Two weeks, 14 days.

1913
01:18:48,890 --> 01:18:49,858
- So, you're taking 
all that medication,

1914
01:18:49,858 --> 01:18:51,259
you're completely off?

1915
01:18:51,259 --> 01:18:52,961
- Completely off everything.

1916
01:18:52,961 --> 01:18:54,563
It's just been so 
frustrating to me

1917
01:18:54,563 --> 01:18:58,600
because I went to so many 
different doctors for help

1918
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:01,403
and I tried so many 
different medications

1919
01:19:01,403 --> 01:19:04,272
to help me with my 
asthma and nothing helped

1920
01:19:04,272 --> 01:19:07,209
and I was stuck on the couch 
for the last 10 months,

1921
01:19:07,209 --> 01:19:11,046
unable to breathe, and 
now, in two weeks time,

1922
01:19:12,481 --> 01:19:15,350
14 days, I'm off my medication.

1923
01:19:15,350 --> 01:19:18,887
And I can breathe and I 
feel good, and I can walk.

1924
01:19:18,887 --> 01:19:21,990
My life has changed 
and I took two weeks

1925
01:19:21,990 --> 01:19:24,159
of a whole plant-based diet.

1926
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:25,393
- [Kip] That's incredible.

1927
01:19:25,393 --> 01:19:26,228
- Yeah.

1928
01:19:27,295 --> 01:19:28,530
- That was incredible.

1929
01:19:28,530 --> 01:19:30,932
- It really is. 
- That sounds amazing.

1930
01:19:30,932 --> 01:19:32,167
- I know, it really is.

1931
01:19:32,167 --> 01:19:35,871
I feel so blessed and so 
good and just so happy

1932
01:19:37,472 --> 01:19:39,274
to be doing this and I'm hoping

1933
01:19:39,274 --> 01:19:41,309
that I can be a role 
model for other people

1934
01:19:41,309 --> 01:19:43,378
and not be pushy about it

1935
01:19:44,813 --> 01:19:48,416
because everyone's gonna 
do it in their own time.

1936
01:19:48,416 --> 01:19:50,752
But think on my time is now.

1937
01:19:53,555 --> 01:19:54,656
- [Kip] That's incredible.

1938
01:19:54,656 --> 01:19:56,091
- Thanks, thanks.

1939
01:19:58,860 --> 01:20:00,562
- [Kip] As powerful 
as Amy's story was,

1940
01:20:00,562 --> 01:20:03,265
I knew for some, 
eating 100% plant-based

1941
01:20:03,265 --> 01:20:05,000
would still seem extreme.

1942
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,802
- I think, there's the 
sense that everything's okay

1943
01:20:07,802 --> 01:20:10,071
in moderation, right?

1944
01:20:10,071 --> 01:20:14,342
But we haven't seen 
that moderation works.

1945
01:20:14,342 --> 01:20:15,710
There really isn't 
a study that shows

1946
01:20:15,710 --> 01:20:18,446
that by eating meat 
and eggs in moderation,

1947
01:20:18,446 --> 01:20:20,182
you can actually turn 
your heart disease around

1948
01:20:20,182 --> 01:20:21,650
and get better.

1949
01:20:21,650 --> 01:20:22,851
- [Kip] But I know people 
who have given up meat

1950
01:20:22,851 --> 01:20:24,319
and they felt sick.

1951
01:20:24,319 --> 01:20:26,755
- It's unlikely that 
anybody's symptoms

1952
01:20:26,755 --> 01:20:29,658
are caused by a dead 
decaying flesh deficiency.

1953
01:20:29,658 --> 01:20:32,894
The lack of highly processed 
animal food products

1954
01:20:32,894 --> 01:20:34,996
in the diet is not 
gonna be associated

1955
01:20:34,996 --> 01:20:37,332
with the causal factor 
about why there is that.

1956
01:20:37,332 --> 01:20:39,367
There is gonna be a reason 
why they're not feeling well

1957
01:20:39,367 --> 01:20:40,835
but that's not gonna 
be one of them.

1958
01:20:40,835 --> 01:20:42,704
- So, I've had people go 
vegan and they come back to me

1959
01:20:42,704 --> 01:20:44,339
and they're like, 
"I'm hypothyroid

1960
01:20:44,339 --> 01:20:45,874
"and my doctor says 
I'm hypothyroid

1961
01:20:45,874 --> 01:20:50,445
"because plant-based diet 
makes you hypothyroid."

1962
01:20:50,445 --> 01:20:52,280
I'm like, so, what is 
your doctor tell all

1963
01:20:52,280 --> 01:20:54,115
his meat-eaters that 
are hypothyroid?

1964
01:20:54,115 --> 01:20:55,784
- [Kip] What was in 
animal flesh or dairy

1965
01:20:55,784 --> 01:20:58,553
that you can't get 
in plant-based?

1966
01:20:58,553 --> 01:21:02,057
- Cholesterol, heterocyclic 
amines, E-coli.

1967
01:21:03,692 --> 01:21:04,960
You know, if you think about it,

1968
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:07,729
there is nothing in 
an animal-based diet

1969
01:21:07,729 --> 01:21:10,932
that you can't get in the 
healthier form somewhere else.

1970
01:21:10,932 --> 01:21:13,535
- I think, only other 
vitamin is vitamin B12,

1971
01:21:13,535 --> 01:21:15,737
it's not made by plants, 
not made by animals either,

1972
01:21:15,737 --> 01:21:17,772
made by a little microbes 
that blanket the earth.

1973
01:21:17,772 --> 01:21:20,542
Because the way we live 
in unsanitized world,

1974
01:21:20,542 --> 01:21:23,645
unless you're eating 
bacteria-contaminated foods,

1975
01:21:23,645 --> 01:21:25,547
we need to get a source 
of B12 from somewhere,

1976
01:21:25,547 --> 01:21:28,316
so, the healthiest, 
cheapest, safest source

1977
01:21:28,316 --> 01:21:30,685
is getting vitamin 
B12 fortified food

1978
01:21:30,685 --> 01:21:32,020
or vitamin B12 supplement,

1979
01:21:32,020 --> 01:21:34,022
not to get it from 
meat and dairy.

1980
01:21:34,022 --> 01:21:35,523
- [Kip] What about people 
who say they have to eat meat

1981
01:21:35,523 --> 01:21:38,827
for their blood 
type or their genes?

1982
01:21:38,827 --> 01:21:41,796
- It's like, "I need meat 
because I'm a Capricorn,"

1983
01:21:41,796 --> 01:21:43,298
"I need meat 'cause I 
have an A plus blood."

1984
01:21:43,298 --> 01:21:44,399
It's like, what do you say?

1985
01:21:44,399 --> 01:21:46,201
No one has to eat meat.

1986
01:21:46,201 --> 01:21:48,303
There's not vitamin, 
mineral, nutrient

1987
01:21:48,303 --> 01:21:51,973
that you can't get from 
non-animal sources.

1988
01:21:51,973 --> 01:21:55,210
- Valentine's Day, I've 
decided to go vegan

1989
01:21:55,210 --> 01:21:58,480
and give up all 
meat, which was never

1990
01:21:58,480 --> 01:22:00,715
in my thoughts in a 
while, million years,

1991
01:22:00,715 --> 01:22:04,119
but I've heard so much success 
from people that are vegan.

1992
01:22:04,119 --> 01:22:07,188
So, I gave up all animal 
product whatsoever,

1993
01:22:07,188 --> 01:22:11,359
I've lost 29 pounds, I've been 
able to cut my med in half.

1994
01:22:12,527 --> 01:22:14,663
I've been able to cut 
my insulin in half

1995
01:22:14,663 --> 01:22:16,698
and now, I'm going for the moon.

1996
01:22:16,698 --> 01:22:18,233
I'm gonna go cut it all out.

1997
01:22:18,233 --> 01:22:21,236
In the last six weeks, we've 
just had three grandchildren

1998
01:22:21,236 --> 01:22:23,271
and my ugly face 
is gonna be around

1999
01:22:23,271 --> 01:22:25,807
to see them graduate from 
high school and college.

2000
01:22:25,807 --> 01:22:27,075
I'm gonna be here.

2001
01:22:27,075 --> 01:22:28,610
- My mission is to 
let everybody know

2002
01:22:28,610 --> 01:22:32,647
you do not have to suffer 
from diabetes and cancer,

2003
01:22:32,647 --> 01:22:34,949
and heart disease because 
someone in your family had it

2004
01:22:34,949 --> 01:22:36,618
or because the doctors 
are telling you,

2005
01:22:36,618 --> 01:22:38,486
this is what's gonna happen.

2006
01:22:38,486 --> 01:22:40,255
You can take charge 
of your health

2007
01:22:40,255 --> 01:22:43,825
and have a positive 
outcome just like I did.

2008
01:22:43,825 --> 01:22:46,761
The reason I'm so 
committed to this is...

2009
01:22:46,761 --> 01:22:48,830
My grandmother had diabetes,

2010
01:22:48,830 --> 01:22:53,468
and I didn't know what I know 
now about healing the body

2011
01:22:53,468 --> 01:22:55,970
and if I did, I feel 
like she could've lived

2012
01:22:55,970 --> 01:22:57,839
at least a few years longer.

2013
01:22:57,839 --> 01:22:59,574
So, it's in her honor

2014
01:23:01,843 --> 01:23:03,511
that I do what I do

2015
01:23:03,511 --> 01:23:05,246
'cause I can save someone 
else's grandmother,

2016
01:23:05,246 --> 01:23:08,583
aunt, uncle, father 
from that, you know.

2017
01:23:10,952 --> 01:23:13,288
So,

2018
01:23:14,622 --> 01:23:18,326
so, I'm excited about getting 
the message out there.

2019
01:23:18,326 --> 01:23:19,427
- [Kip] There's a common belief

2020
01:23:19,427 --> 01:23:21,463
that eating plant-based 
is expensive.

2021
01:23:21,463 --> 01:23:22,731
- Not at all.

2022
01:23:22,731 --> 01:23:25,734
It can be done in a 
very inexpensive way

2023
01:23:25,734 --> 01:23:28,103
where you buy foods 
that are in season

2024
01:23:28,103 --> 01:23:32,173
and you shop in the bulk bins 
and that saves a lot of money.

2025
01:23:32,173 --> 01:23:35,043
You can eliminate a 
lot of your expenses

2026
01:23:35,043 --> 01:23:38,179
on your grocery bill by 
not buying meat and dairy

2027
01:23:38,179 --> 01:23:40,348
because these things 
are expensive.

2028
01:23:40,348 --> 01:23:42,550
Our meal plan for 
a family of four

2029
01:23:42,550 --> 01:23:45,453
is $25 per person in the family.

2030
01:23:45,453 --> 01:23:47,288
- 20.64 is your total.

2031
01:23:48,256 --> 01:23:49,858
- [Kip] 20.64, whoa!

2032
01:23:49,858 --> 01:23:51,226
That's her entire week of food.

2033
01:23:51,226 --> 01:23:52,660
- [Cashier] Really?

2034
01:23:52,660 --> 01:23:54,329
- [Kip] An exploding 
movement of elite athletes

2035
01:23:54,329 --> 01:23:56,531
are utilizing vegan 
diets to heal injuries,

2036
01:23:56,531 --> 01:23:59,801
speed recovery times and 
enhance their performance.

2037
01:23:59,801 --> 01:24:01,069
- Before I was vegan,

2038
01:24:01,069 --> 01:24:04,539
I was only benchpressing 
315 like five times.

2039
01:24:04,539 --> 01:24:05,807
Then, after going vegan,

2040
01:24:05,807 --> 01:24:07,976
I was doing 400, 425, 465.

2041
01:24:09,944 --> 01:24:11,946
And I was like, oh my 
god, this is amazing.

2042
01:24:11,946 --> 01:24:15,016
I'm vegan and I'm 
benchpressing 465 pounds.

2043
01:24:15,016 --> 01:24:16,184
This is ridiculous.

2044
01:24:16,184 --> 01:24:17,452
And as soon as I went vegan,

2045
01:24:17,452 --> 01:24:19,154
tendonitis started disappearing.

2046
01:24:19,154 --> 01:24:21,322
My strength in my right 
arm start coming back.

2047
01:24:21,322 --> 01:24:23,024
High blood pressure 
was going down.

2048
01:24:23,024 --> 01:24:26,761
You can't be strong and 
be dying on the hindsight,

2049
01:24:26,761 --> 01:24:29,964
that's not strong, that's 
weak, that's really weak

2050
01:24:29,964 --> 01:24:32,000
because you look big and 
strong in the outside,

2051
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:35,170
yeah, big man, no, but your 
heart's crying for help.

2052
01:24:35,170 --> 01:24:37,338
On the inside, you're dying.

2053
01:24:37,338 --> 01:24:39,441
- I'm a professional 
parkour athlete,

2054
01:24:39,441 --> 01:24:40,942
two-time world 
freerunning champion.

2055
01:24:40,942 --> 01:24:42,744
More recently, I got 
into Ninja Warrior

2056
01:24:42,744 --> 01:24:43,912
where I'm captain of Team Europe

2057
01:24:43,912 --> 01:24:46,448
as we won USA versus the world.

2058
01:24:46,448 --> 01:24:49,050
For something like Ninja Warrior 
and parkour specifically,

2059
01:24:49,050 --> 01:24:52,287
you really need to have good 
strength to body weight ratio.

2060
01:24:52,287 --> 01:24:54,222
So, I was carrying massive, 
I really didn't need

2061
01:24:54,222 --> 01:24:56,458
and when I went vegan, 
I lost 15, 20 pounds,

2062
01:24:56,458 --> 01:24:58,460
I was more agile, I 
was more efficient,

2063
01:24:58,460 --> 01:24:59,994
and more stamina in my body,

2064
01:24:59,994 --> 01:25:01,863
just that extra bit of pop 
that I didn't have before,

2065
01:25:01,863 --> 01:25:03,598
it just gave that 
extra strength.

2066
01:25:03,598 --> 01:25:05,867
This is a very 
vibrant way to live.

2067
01:25:05,867 --> 01:25:07,802
It can enhance 
you as an athlete.

2068
01:25:07,802 --> 01:25:10,605
For me, 100% better 
athlete than I was before.

2069
01:25:10,605 --> 01:25:13,074
It unlocks a whole new 
chapter of my training.

2070
01:25:13,074 --> 01:25:14,509
The science is that, 
the health is that

2071
01:25:14,509 --> 01:25:15,743
the athletes, they're 
proving that you don't need

2072
01:25:15,743 --> 01:25:18,913
to eat dead animals to 
be strong to be healthy.

2073
01:25:18,913 --> 01:25:21,616
- I started working out 
when I was 47 years old.

2074
01:25:21,616 --> 01:25:25,086
All that muscles you 
see, I gained as vegan,

2075
01:25:25,086 --> 01:25:27,655
I gained 15 pounds of 
muscles on my body.

2076
01:25:27,655 --> 01:25:29,657
Eating all plant-based 
vegan foods.

2077
01:25:29,657 --> 01:25:33,561
All the aches and pains in 
my body, it just went away

2078
01:25:33,561 --> 01:25:37,098
because I'm not ingesting 
so many inflamed foods,

2079
01:25:37,098 --> 01:25:39,334
the acidic foods that 
animal products are.

2080
01:25:39,334 --> 01:25:41,002
Gorillas, rhinos, and elephants,

2081
01:25:41,002 --> 01:25:44,939
they all get their muscles and 
strength from eating plants.

2082
01:25:44,939 --> 01:25:46,341
That's what I do.

2083
01:25:46,341 --> 01:25:49,444
- I travel all around 
the world for my surfing

2084
01:25:49,444 --> 01:25:51,880
and I've always been 
able to eat vegan.

2085
01:25:51,880 --> 01:25:54,415
I feel like if you 
want something,

2086
01:25:54,415 --> 01:25:55,650
then you can make it happen.

2087
01:25:55,650 --> 01:25:57,285
I just don't make any excuses.

2088
01:25:57,285 --> 01:26:00,321
I would never not be vegan now 
that I know all the benefits

2089
01:26:00,321 --> 01:26:02,790
and now that I know how 
it feels to be vegan.

2090
01:26:02,790 --> 01:26:04,726
- Every aspect of my 
life has been improved

2091
01:26:04,726 --> 01:26:06,828
by adopting this lifestyle.

2092
01:26:06,828 --> 01:26:09,631
I feel better, I perform 
better athletically,

2093
01:26:09,631 --> 01:26:12,667
I sleep better, my energy 
with my kids is better,

2094
01:26:12,667 --> 01:26:15,303
my focus at work is better, 
everything is better.

2095
01:26:15,303 --> 01:26:17,572
My skin cleared 
up, cut myself trim

2096
01:26:17,572 --> 01:26:19,908
for nine years now doing this.

2097
01:26:19,908 --> 01:26:22,243
All I can tell 
you is that I felt

2098
01:26:22,243 --> 01:26:26,581
and I continue to feel better 
than I ever felt before.

2099
01:26:26,581 --> 01:26:28,383
My friend, Jason Lester 
and I were the first people

2100
01:26:28,383 --> 01:26:31,786
to do this challenge 
called EPIC5

2101
01:26:31,786 --> 01:26:33,788
which entail doing five ironmans

2102
01:26:33,788 --> 01:26:36,491
on five Hawaiian 
islands in our group.

2103
01:26:36,491 --> 01:26:38,459
An ironman is a 2.4-mile swim

2104
01:26:38,459 --> 01:26:40,461
followed by 112-mile bike,

2105
01:26:40,461 --> 01:26:44,465
and then running a marathon, 
26.2 miles after that.

2106
01:26:44,465 --> 01:26:45,967
So, we did five 
of those in a row

2107
01:26:45,967 --> 01:26:49,470
on five different islands 
and in little under a week.

2108
01:26:49,470 --> 01:26:50,605
- Yeah, you almost die?

2109
01:26:50,605 --> 01:26:52,340
- Yeah, die.

2110
01:26:52,340 --> 01:26:53,541
- So, I guess the 
famous question,

2111
01:26:53,541 --> 01:26:55,310
where did you get your 
protein?

2112
01:26:55,310 --> 01:26:59,314
- From plants.

2113
01:26:59,314 --> 01:27:01,215
- [Kip] Like so many people, 
I was looking for excuses

2114
01:27:01,215 --> 01:27:03,885
not to change my diet 
but once I finally did,

2115
01:27:03,885 --> 01:27:05,420
I felt liberated.

2116
01:27:05,420 --> 01:27:07,789
Within days, I could feel the 
blood running through my veins

2117
01:27:07,789 --> 01:27:09,190
with a new vitality.

2118
01:27:09,190 --> 01:27:10,925
Within weeks, I felt 
a transformation

2119
01:27:10,925 --> 01:27:13,328
throughout my entire 
body and mind.

2120
01:27:13,328 --> 01:27:16,564
Not only could I survive on a 
purely plant-based vegan diet,

2121
01:27:16,564 --> 01:27:19,100
I could thrive, I felt amazing.

2122
01:27:19,100 --> 01:27:22,070
I competed my first 
marathon in six years

2123
01:27:22,070 --> 01:27:23,304
training half the amount

2124
01:27:23,304 --> 01:27:25,873
and beat my personal 
record by 23 minutes.

2125
01:27:25,873 --> 01:27:29,143
Less than a month later, I 
did my first full ironman.

2126
01:27:29,143 --> 01:27:30,545
Although I could 
possibly get away

2127
01:27:30,545 --> 01:27:32,280
with eating a little 
bit of meat and dairy

2128
01:27:32,280 --> 01:27:34,415
without ill effects 
to my personal health,

2129
01:27:34,415 --> 01:27:36,351
I could no longer willingly 
support an industry

2130
01:27:36,351 --> 01:27:39,020
I knew was causing so much 
suffering to communities,

2131
01:27:39,020 --> 01:27:41,823
families, and all 
life on the planet.

2132
01:27:41,823 --> 01:27:45,126
A whole new world opened 
up, I felt whole again,

2133
01:27:45,126 --> 01:27:47,862
connected to a greater 
sense of what true health is

2134
01:27:47,862 --> 01:27:50,298
and where true health 
doesn't end with me

2135
01:27:50,298 --> 01:27:51,866
but begins with us.

2136
01:27:53,501 --> 01:27:55,903
- If people adopted 
a plant-based diet,

2137
01:27:55,903 --> 01:28:00,842
the changes we would see 
in our individual health,

2138
01:28:00,842 --> 01:28:02,810
in our national 
health situation,

2139
01:28:02,810 --> 01:28:06,047
and in this physical 
environmental world we live in

2140
01:28:06,047 --> 01:28:08,316
would be so profound.

2141
01:28:08,316 --> 01:28:11,019
- I mean, today, you can say,

2142
01:28:11,019 --> 01:28:13,054
"I'm not gonna eat 
that stuff anymore.

2143
01:28:13,054 --> 01:28:16,691
"It's one thing that I 
can do myself personally

2144
01:28:16,691 --> 01:28:18,092
"to make a difference."

2145
01:28:18,092 --> 01:28:19,627
- It will give you a 
greater sense of well-being

2146
01:28:19,627 --> 01:28:22,030
and happiness when 
you know that one,

2147
01:28:22,030 --> 01:28:23,698
you're not destroying 
your health

2148
01:28:23,698 --> 01:28:24,932
every time you sit down to eat,

2149
01:28:24,932 --> 01:28:26,668
you're not promoting cruelty,

2150
01:28:26,668 --> 01:28:28,302
and you're not 
damaging the Earth.

2151
01:28:28,302 --> 01:28:30,171
- I don't want my gains 
to be at the detriment

2152
01:28:30,171 --> 01:28:31,706
of the planet of other things

2153
01:28:31,706 --> 01:28:33,641
and yet, I'm not 
weaker, I'm stronger.

2154
01:28:33,641 --> 01:28:34,909
That's the beauty of it.

2155
01:28:34,909 --> 01:28:36,144
When you all twist and 
when you make choices

2156
01:28:36,144 --> 01:28:37,912
for the great good of 
others, it comes around,

2157
01:28:37,912 --> 01:28:39,781
benefits as well, 
benefits us all.

2158
01:28:39,781 --> 01:28:42,150
- Studies show that 
we cannot only survive

2159
01:28:42,150 --> 01:28:43,384
but we can thrive.

2160
01:28:43,384 --> 01:28:45,987
- I just feel this is 
a great way to live.

2161
01:28:45,987 --> 01:28:47,622
Not harm the other beings

2162
01:28:47,622 --> 01:28:49,924
when we can be 
healthy and happier.

2163
01:28:49,924 --> 01:28:52,860
I love it, it's a great life.

2164
01:28:52,860 --> 01:28:56,097
- I never thought that I could 
feel this good at this age

2165
01:28:56,097 --> 01:28:58,433
and I just want everybody 
to feel this way.

2166
01:28:58,433 --> 01:29:01,202
I feel like a 20-year-old, 
I'm almost 50.

2167
01:29:01,202 --> 01:29:04,839
- Nothing tastes as good as 
health, it feels basically.

2168
01:29:04,839 --> 01:29:07,108
- And so, the choices that 
we make every single day,

2169
01:29:07,108 --> 01:29:09,310
day in and day out 
around our food

2170
01:29:09,310 --> 01:29:13,448
has the capacity to bring us 
true health, optimal wellness,

2171
01:29:13,448 --> 01:29:16,150
not just individually 
but collectively

2172
01:29:16,150 --> 01:29:18,586
as species and for our planet.

2173
01:29:18,586 --> 01:29:20,922
- We're not gonna live forever

2174
01:29:20,922 --> 01:29:23,491
but while we are alive, 
we can live well.

2175
01:29:23,491 --> 01:29:26,027
And, for me, as a doctor, 
that's what I wanna see.

2176
01:29:26,027 --> 01:29:29,697
- Where there's a 
will, there is a way,

2177
01:29:29,697 --> 01:29:31,265
and I believe that.
