1
00:01:33,096 --> 00:01:36,031
Here you go. $50,000 for your $500,000.

2
00:01:43,573 --> 00:01:45,040
Don't you want to see mine?

3
00:01:46,442 --> 00:01:48,000
Oh, right. Of course.

4
00:01:48,845 --> 00:01:50,403
Of course.

5
00:01:52,748 --> 00:01:54,375
You look nervous, friend.

6
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:57,681
No, it's just, you know, cold.

7
00:02:12,435 --> 00:02:12,992
Perfect.

8
00:02:13,569 --> 00:02:14,900
Very realistic.

9
00:02:15,571 --> 00:02:18,404
It always is. My specialty.

10
00:02:58,948 --> 00:03:00,916
That will warm you up.

11
00:03:58,608 --> 00:04:00,405
Breakfast, everybody!

12
00:04:03,045 --> 00:04:05,980
Morning, sweetheart.
Did that explosion wake you up last night?

13
00:04:06,082 --> 00:04:08,812
Explosion? No.
But the sirens woke me up.

14
00:04:09,118 --> 00:04:12,053
I was having trouble sleeping,
so around 4:00...

15
00:04:12,121 --> 00:04:14,453
...I thought I'd bake bread.

16
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:19,627
Then I thought, "Wouldn't it be nice
if we had a family breakfast for once?"

17
00:04:19,729 --> 00:04:22,892
So, I did the dishes and made breakfast.

18
00:04:24,567 --> 00:04:27,502
I'd have fixed the bathroom,
but I'd have made too much noise.

19
00:04:27,603 --> 00:04:30,800
- No, that's on my list.
- Norman, that is your list.

20
00:04:31,507 --> 00:04:33,941
Then it's on it. It's as good as done.

21
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:37,546
Come on,
we're gonna have a nice family breakfast.

22
00:04:38,614 --> 00:04:40,241
Come on, Cindy, hurry up.

23
00:04:40,583 --> 00:04:43,074
I got four more minutes.
Check the schedule.

24
00:04:43,686 --> 00:04:47,918
- You're not even doing anything.
- It's the principle of the thing.

25
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:49,589
Oh, man.

26
00:04:49,892 --> 00:04:54,829
A high-speed police chase last night
ended in suburban Pleasant Valley.

27
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:57,865
A dozen highway-patrol cars
joined the Metro Division...

28
00:04:57,967 --> 00:05:00,936
...at speeds over 120 miles per hour.

29
00:05:01,304 --> 00:05:02,862
It's not safe anymore.

30
00:05:03,906 --> 00:05:05,237
I think I should buy a gun.

31
00:05:05,908 --> 00:05:08,604
That's just what this town needs:
You with a gun.

32
00:05:08,744 --> 00:05:12,236
Come down, kids!
We're gonna have a nice family breakfast!

33
00:05:15,751 --> 00:05:17,241
- Thanks, Dad.
- Hold it.

34
00:05:20,022 --> 00:05:21,250
What is this?

35
00:05:21,891 --> 00:05:23,119
A pack of cigarettes.

36
00:05:23,225 --> 00:05:24,692
I know that.

37
00:05:25,127 --> 00:05:28,028
What were they doing in your coat?
Are you smoking?

38
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:29,563
So what if I am?

39
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,233
"So what if I am?"

40
00:05:33,069 --> 00:05:34,934
Do you know what smoking does?

41
00:05:35,571 --> 00:05:38,734
It stunts growth,
yellows teeth and blackens lungs.

42
00:05:38,941 --> 00:05:41,739
Do you want to be a yellow-toothed midget
with lung cancer?

43
00:05:42,111 --> 00:05:44,204
I like to keep my options open.

44
00:05:44,647 --> 00:05:45,739
Hey, Kev!

45
00:05:46,082 --> 00:05:47,913
I've got a surprise for you.

46
00:05:50,052 --> 00:05:51,314
What'd you do that for?

47
00:05:52,688 --> 00:05:54,155
You were supposed to catch it.

48
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,828
You wearing that to school again?

49
00:05:59,962 --> 00:06:01,827
Yes, my father.

50
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:07,029
Have you noticed something funny
around the house lately?

51
00:06:07,169 --> 00:06:09,330
Come on, Billy, we'll be late again.

52
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:12,664
Like it's all falling apart,
nobody likes each other.

53
00:06:14,143 --> 00:06:17,909
Norman, this may not be
the perfect family, but it's close.

54
00:06:18,013 --> 00:06:20,038
There's still a lot of affection. I know.

55
00:06:20,249 --> 00:06:23,275
I cook the meals. I run the house.
Do I complain?

56
00:06:23,386 --> 00:06:28,824
No, because I love being a homemaker.
I find it fulfilling and rewarding.

57
00:06:29,325 --> 00:06:30,917
Nothing's falling apart...

58
00:06:31,093 --> 00:06:35,052
...and everybody loves one another.
So get off my back!

59
00:06:37,933 --> 00:06:39,594
Everything's fine!

60
00:06:43,305 --> 00:06:45,136
Mom! Mom!

61
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:49,803
She'll be back, son.

62
00:06:54,984 --> 00:06:56,315
There we are.

63
00:06:59,922 --> 00:07:01,253
A bit nutty today.

64
00:07:03,859 --> 00:07:05,827
Just a little back-up practice.

65
00:07:06,128 --> 00:07:07,356
In you go.

66
00:07:08,364 --> 00:07:09,797
Get in the car, Billy.

67
00:07:10,032 --> 00:07:11,727
Can it be a hearse?

68
00:07:12,768 --> 00:07:13,996
Get in the hearse.

69
00:07:17,173 --> 00:07:18,367
Buckle up.

70
00:07:38,327 --> 00:07:39,692
The Green Hornet.

71
00:07:42,331 --> 00:07:43,423
We got one for you.

72
00:07:43,799 --> 00:07:45,994
How did the bird save Baretta
when he was tied up...

73
00:07:46,068 --> 00:07:49,265
By pecking out the number of the police
on the phone.

74
00:07:49,338 --> 00:07:51,898
Episode 23. That the best you can do?

75
00:07:54,009 --> 00:07:56,102
How does he know all those shows?

76
00:07:58,881 --> 00:08:01,850
Isn't it silly wasting your time
on these dumb cop shows?

77
00:08:02,084 --> 00:08:04,985
Why not watch something important,
like baseball?

78
00:08:05,087 --> 00:08:06,315
Silly?

79
00:08:06,422 --> 00:08:09,186
Phil, somewhere in the world,
every second of the day...

80
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:12,260
...an episode of Kojak is being rerun.
Is baseball?

81
00:08:12,461 --> 00:08:15,988
- Not during the off-season.
- Kojak has no off-season.

82
00:08:28,511 --> 00:08:32,208
A bagel with no cream cheese,
and with butter on the side.

83
00:08:52,268 --> 00:08:54,793
I said no cream cheese. Excuse me?

84
00:09:32,174 --> 00:09:35,507
I'm a good cop.
I show up on time, fill in my reports.

85
00:09:36,845 --> 00:09:40,076
That's why you and Jake team so well.
He can't spell.

86
00:09:40,182 --> 00:09:42,343
Can't you see I'm begging you here?

87
00:09:42,518 --> 00:09:45,009
My cops shouldn't beg. Don't do that.

88
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,351
I don't know how else to say this.
I want a new partner.

89
00:09:49,592 --> 00:09:51,253
You want a new partner?

90
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:55,920
Jake would be happier teamed
with somebody more like him.

91
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,430
Where am I gonna find someone like that?

92
00:10:00,603 --> 00:10:04,539
I've known Jake 30 years.
You don't have to tell me he's...

93
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:07,104
...a pain, but he's a good cop.

94
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:11,145
Please, I'm begging you
not to do this to me.

95
00:10:12,114 --> 00:10:13,809
You're a good team.

96
00:10:14,216 --> 00:10:16,150
Captain, he hates me.

97
00:10:17,152 --> 00:10:18,449
Of course he hates you.

98
00:10:20,089 --> 00:10:22,990
He hates me. He hates everybody.

99
00:10:23,926 --> 00:10:26,486
Hey, Jake, don't you hate everybody?

100
00:10:29,231 --> 00:10:31,563
There. Now, don't we all feel better?

101
00:10:32,434 --> 00:10:33,298
I got this for you.

102
00:10:34,637 --> 00:10:35,899
Osborn.

103
00:10:36,005 --> 00:10:40,965
He's in a counterfeiting ring.
He's been eliminating the competition.

104
00:10:41,176 --> 00:10:44,145
- How?
- By eliminating the competition.

105
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:49,915
Now he's rented a home under the alias
John Henderson in Pleasant Valley.

106
00:10:50,619 --> 00:10:52,052
Pleasant Valley?

107
00:10:52,388 --> 00:10:56,916
I guess he figured we wouldn't look there.
I want you and Tony...

108
00:10:57,059 --> 00:10:58,959
...to post a stakeout next door.

109
00:10:59,895 --> 00:11:03,228
If we know where he is,
why don't we just go and grab him?

110
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:05,924
You got a lot of youthful enthusiasm.

111
00:11:06,135 --> 00:11:09,502
I hate that.
We don't just go and grab Osborn.

112
00:11:09,605 --> 00:11:12,039
We want him to lead us to somebody big:

113
00:11:12,941 --> 00:11:14,431
Frederick Lutz.

114
00:11:14,977 --> 00:11:18,469
He's picking up a bundle of phony $50s
from Osborn this week.

115
00:11:20,149 --> 00:11:22,379
I thought he ordered...

116
00:11:23,552 --> 00:11:26,112
I thought he ordered a hit on Osborn.

117
00:11:26,522 --> 00:11:28,615
I guess they kissed and made up.

118
00:11:30,292 --> 00:11:33,625
The deal will go down in the house,
so watch for Lutz.

119
00:11:34,263 --> 00:11:36,390
Jake, this house we're staying in...

120
00:11:36,565 --> 00:11:38,192
...who lives there?

121
00:11:38,967 --> 00:11:40,127
Who cares?

122
00:11:40,569 --> 00:11:42,264
I've mentioned this before:

123
00:11:42,404 --> 00:11:46,306
Volume 8 of Police Woman
is missing 11 seconds of its end credits.

124
00:11:46,508 --> 00:11:48,305
Anybody else complain about it?

125
00:11:48,677 --> 00:11:50,508
No one else has ever rented it.

126
00:11:51,246 --> 00:11:52,679
It's American history.

127
00:11:53,048 --> 00:11:54,106
Norman Robberson?

128
00:11:55,084 --> 00:11:56,517
Detective Stone.

129
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:59,954
We need to speak with you.

130
00:12:00,522 --> 00:12:02,547
Did I forget to rewind my tapes?

131
00:12:02,725 --> 00:12:04,283
Come with us, please.

132
00:12:04,626 --> 00:12:05,991
Is that it?

133
00:12:07,629 --> 00:12:09,324
Geez, you guys are strict.

134
00:12:17,206 --> 00:12:18,696
I don't know about this.

135
00:12:20,342 --> 00:12:23,402
Mr. Robberson, you're next door
to a dangerous criminal.

136
00:12:23,479 --> 00:12:27,176
Your home is perfect cover
for an effective stakeout.

137
00:12:28,984 --> 00:12:30,315
Look...

138
00:12:31,587 --> 00:12:34,556
...my family's going through
a difficult time right now.

139
00:12:34,656 --> 00:12:38,956
I don't know if bringing cops
and counterfeiters into the house...

140
00:12:39,094 --> 00:12:40,561
...is the right thing.

141
00:12:42,331 --> 00:12:44,162
The right thing?

142
00:12:47,002 --> 00:12:49,596
What is the right thing, Mr. Robberson?

143
00:12:52,741 --> 00:12:54,436
Covering your ass?

144
00:12:55,244 --> 00:12:58,077
Worrying about the comfort
of the wife and kiddies?

145
00:12:59,047 --> 00:13:00,981
We're all just...

146
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:06,545
...one inch away from a lawless society.

147
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:10,351
Know what keeps that nightmare away?

148
00:13:11,794 --> 00:13:13,227
Men.

149
00:13:14,096 --> 00:13:15,586
Lone men.

150
00:13:16,398 --> 00:13:18,059
Men with the courage...

151
00:13:18,167 --> 00:13:22,035
...to stand up to the night
and spit in its eye!

152
00:13:30,212 --> 00:13:31,702
What do you say, Robberson?

153
00:13:32,681 --> 00:13:36,082
You got the guts to be one of those men?

154
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:39,780
Wow.

155
00:13:41,723 --> 00:13:43,088
What'd you tell your wife?

156
00:13:43,292 --> 00:13:45,760
My wife. Yes, Helen, yes, well...

157
00:13:46,328 --> 00:13:48,421
It's best I tell her in the morning.

158
00:13:48,564 --> 00:13:51,761
- Tomorrow? We're moving in tonight.
- I know, I know.

159
00:13:52,134 --> 00:13:53,328
That's fine.

160
00:13:54,803 --> 00:13:59,103
But I think Helen would be more receptive
to all this in the light of day.

161
00:13:59,842 --> 00:14:01,503
Don't worry, it's my problem.

162
00:14:02,211 --> 00:14:03,803
I'll handle it in the morning.

163
00:14:04,513 --> 00:14:07,505
That's Osborn's house.
You guys better duck.

164
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:10,343
Don't let him see us.

165
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:16,257
Ten-four. We'll enter the surveillance
domicile through the garage entryway.

166
00:14:17,192 --> 00:14:18,489
Wonderful.

167
00:14:25,667 --> 00:14:27,100
The door is stuck.

168
00:14:28,403 --> 00:14:33,636
- What's the procedure if the garage entry...
- Get us in the damn house! Come on.

169
00:14:33,876 --> 00:14:36,276
Sometimes I can jimmy it from inside.

170
00:14:54,162 --> 00:14:56,096
Mr. Robberson!

171
00:15:18,453 --> 00:15:20,853
Come on, come on. All right.

172
00:15:48,951 --> 00:15:50,578
I think that went well.

173
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,489
Norman!

174
00:16:06,702 --> 00:16:09,170
- Geez, that's my wife.
- So what?

175
00:16:09,404 --> 00:16:11,235
Look, I know my wife.

176
00:16:11,306 --> 00:16:13,365
Let me break this to her
in my own way. Here.

177
00:16:14,376 --> 00:16:17,209
Trust me on this. Please, officers.

178
00:16:18,814 --> 00:16:22,409
- It's a goddamn closet!
- I know, but, please.

179
00:16:23,452 --> 00:16:24,646
Go ahead.

180
00:16:28,757 --> 00:16:30,850
Yeah, yeah, close it.

181
00:16:36,231 --> 00:16:38,665
Norman, was that our car alarm?

182
00:16:39,334 --> 00:16:40,426
No.

183
00:16:41,803 --> 00:16:43,532
It sounded like our car alarm.

184
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:45,867
It was.

185
00:16:52,848 --> 00:16:54,213
What's that?

186
00:16:54,483 --> 00:16:55,575
What?

187
00:16:55,717 --> 00:16:57,651
A noise came from the closet.

188
00:16:57,886 --> 00:17:01,447
The closet? That was the cat.

189
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:04,982
The cat?
What's the cat doing in the closet?

190
00:17:06,828 --> 00:17:10,389
Who knows? Could be doing anything.
The door's closed.

191
00:17:10,832 --> 00:17:12,823
Let the cat out of the closet.

192
00:17:12,901 --> 00:17:14,459
I can't do that, Helen.

193
00:17:15,037 --> 00:17:17,699
- Why not?
- Because I'm training her.

194
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,302
She was a bad cat and I'm disciplining her.

195
00:17:21,743 --> 00:17:23,973
Bad cat! Very bad.

196
00:17:24,513 --> 00:17:25,741
What's going on?

197
00:17:26,014 --> 00:17:28,710
Nothing. Go back to sleep.

198
00:17:31,653 --> 00:17:32,847
Norman?

199
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,394
Now you're a very bad cat.

200
00:17:41,997 --> 00:17:45,296
I told you to stay in the closet.

201
00:17:54,076 --> 00:17:54,770
Dad!

202
00:17:55,911 --> 00:17:59,005
When it comes to cat training,
you have to be very firm.

203
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:10,558
You little bastard!

204
00:18:19,968 --> 00:18:22,402
Don't ever throw a cat on me again.

205
00:18:22,504 --> 00:18:24,870
Jake, easy, come on. Come on.

206
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:29,866
Okay, this is Billy's room. He's asleep.

207
00:18:30,979 --> 00:18:33,914
And you can see the house
right through there.

208
00:18:37,686 --> 00:18:39,586
So, when do we start?

209
00:18:40,455 --> 00:18:42,514
Have we started? Is this part of it?

210
00:18:43,358 --> 00:18:44,518
Maybe I can help.

211
00:18:48,463 --> 00:18:49,623
You've done enough.

212
00:18:50,732 --> 00:18:53,064
Then I'll let you go about your work.

213
00:18:55,837 --> 00:18:57,771
Billy sleeps soundly.

214
00:18:57,873 --> 00:19:00,774
I'll tell my wife in the morning.
I'm up by 06:00.

215
00:21:25,987 --> 00:21:28,080
Norman, save me some water.

216
00:21:45,273 --> 00:21:46,570
Morning, Norman.

217
00:21:48,243 --> 00:21:49,676
Norman!

218
00:21:56,017 --> 00:21:56,949
Jake!

219
00:21:57,652 --> 00:21:58,846
Jake!

220
00:22:02,724 --> 00:22:04,624
I'm a police officer! Remain calm!

221
00:22:09,698 --> 00:22:10,722
What the...

222
00:22:11,066 --> 00:22:14,627
Dad! There's a man in the house!
He's got a gun!

223
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:17,198
Get away from me!

224
00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:24,040
Get your hands off my kid!

225
00:22:47,702 --> 00:22:50,637
- I'm a police officer.
- No, you're not.

226
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,631
Lieutenant Jake Stone.

227
00:22:55,043 --> 00:22:58,877
And that naked man
laying on top of your husband...

228
00:22:59,347 --> 00:23:01,042
...is my partner.

229
00:23:03,218 --> 00:23:04,048
Ma'am.

230
00:23:04,953 --> 00:23:06,113
Put the plunger down.

231
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:11,314
Good work.

232
00:23:13,027 --> 00:23:16,986
Anybody who screams or runs...

233
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,768
...or hits me with anything...

234
00:23:21,136 --> 00:23:23,331
...is gonna get shot. Okay?

235
00:23:24,406 --> 00:23:25,634
Bitchin'.

236
00:23:28,143 --> 00:23:29,371
Our neighbor?

237
00:23:29,677 --> 00:23:30,371
Osborn.

238
00:23:34,048 --> 00:23:37,381
I know this is your job,
and I know it's important, but...

239
00:23:37,652 --> 00:23:40,212
...I can't let my family take this risk.

240
00:23:40,655 --> 00:23:42,623
I have to ask you both to leave.

241
00:23:42,891 --> 00:23:45,689
Leave? Honey, they can't leave.

242
00:23:46,294 --> 00:23:47,386
Can you?

243
00:23:47,896 --> 00:23:50,865
This operation has already
been green-lighted.

244
00:23:51,099 --> 00:23:52,191
There.

245
00:23:52,667 --> 00:23:54,692
See? It's green-lighted.

246
00:23:56,137 --> 00:23:58,071
Well, now it's red-lighted.

247
00:24:01,042 --> 00:24:05,979
She wants to red-light it. Maybe we can
work out a yellow-light compromise.

248
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,411
Mrs. Robberson...

249
00:24:14,355 --> 00:24:16,050
...we're all just...

250
00:24:16,458 --> 00:24:19,791
...one inch away from a lawless society.

251
00:24:20,762 --> 00:24:22,286
Do you know what keeps that...

252
00:24:23,865 --> 00:24:25,355
...nightmare away?

253
00:24:29,037 --> 00:24:30,129
Men.

254
00:24:30,705 --> 00:24:32,673
Lone men.

255
00:24:33,908 --> 00:24:38,845
Men with the courage to stand up
to the night and spit in its eye.

256
00:24:42,984 --> 00:24:44,747
Mrs. Robberson...

257
00:24:46,254 --> 00:24:48,882
...do you have the courage
to stand with us?

258
00:24:55,864 --> 00:24:57,422
Give me a break!

259
00:24:58,733 --> 00:25:03,796
Mrs. Robberson, we didn't put Osborn
next door, but he's there and he's a killer.

260
00:25:04,372 --> 00:25:07,307
Just last week, he blew a man to pieces.

261
00:25:07,442 --> 00:25:10,138
Now, sure, we could walk out the door...

262
00:25:10,411 --> 00:25:12,777
...but Osborn will still be there.

263
00:25:14,782 --> 00:25:17,273
And your family will still be here.

264
00:25:23,758 --> 00:25:26,386
All right. You can stay.

265
00:25:28,429 --> 00:25:29,396
Great.

266
00:25:29,531 --> 00:25:31,158
Great civic spirit.

267
00:25:31,866 --> 00:25:34,061
That's the right choice, Mrs. Robberson.

268
00:25:34,402 --> 00:25:36,836
No, please, call me Helen.

269
00:25:37,005 --> 00:25:40,907
And I want you both to think of this
as your home. Welcome.

270
00:25:44,479 --> 00:25:46,310
What kind of food do you like?

271
00:25:46,414 --> 00:25:47,346
Chinese.

272
00:25:48,016 --> 00:25:50,177
No. Not Chinese.

273
00:25:50,451 --> 00:25:54,012
- They're cops. They eat donuts.
- I can make donuts.

274
00:25:54,289 --> 00:25:55,881
You shouldn't cook for them.

275
00:25:56,291 --> 00:25:58,987
Of course I'll cook for them.
They're guests.

276
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:01,826
I'm sorry, my guests don't smoke.

277
00:26:01,996 --> 00:26:03,327
It's not good for you.

278
00:26:04,032 --> 00:26:08,264
I know I can count on you both
to be a good influence on our children.

279
00:26:27,922 --> 00:26:32,859
Let me ask you: Do I get a discount
if I order more than one mattress?

280
00:26:33,127 --> 00:26:34,116
Yes, sir.

281
00:26:34,362 --> 00:26:35,329
We're in.

282
00:26:36,431 --> 00:26:38,865
AT&T, next best thing to being there.

283
00:26:40,134 --> 00:26:41,499
Mind if I come in?

284
00:26:51,479 --> 00:26:53,447
So that's your window.

285
00:26:58,152 --> 00:26:59,278
There's Tony.

286
00:27:03,891 --> 00:27:05,119
Hey, Tony!

287
00:27:07,629 --> 00:27:08,960
Hi, Norman.

288
00:27:09,631 --> 00:27:11,826
- Ten-four.
- Give me that.

289
00:27:21,476 --> 00:27:24,968
Too bad he closed the curtains.
You can't see him.

290
00:27:26,381 --> 00:27:27,973
I know exactly where he is.

291
00:27:29,951 --> 00:27:32,044
In the bedroom, smoking a cigarette.

292
00:27:37,025 --> 00:27:40,517
Wow. You've got one of those
heat-sensitive cameras?

293
00:27:41,663 --> 00:27:44,496
That must have cost a few tax dollars?

294
00:27:45,199 --> 00:27:46,291
A few.

295
00:27:46,601 --> 00:27:49,161
I bet. But it's worth it.

296
00:27:51,005 --> 00:27:52,370
Just lit one.

297
00:27:54,242 --> 00:27:55,937
What if he's not smoking?

298
00:28:18,366 --> 00:28:20,596
I used to dream of being a cop.

299
00:28:23,571 --> 00:28:25,163
Fighting for what's right...

300
00:28:25,506 --> 00:28:27,371
...putting my life on the line...

301
00:28:27,542 --> 00:28:30,170
...saying "Freeze!" and "Spread 'em!"

302
00:28:32,113 --> 00:28:34,274
And "Rico, Youngblood!"

303
00:28:37,251 --> 00:28:40,550
"You have the right to remain silent. "

304
00:28:48,296 --> 00:28:50,196
I'm talking too much, huh?

305
00:28:55,069 --> 00:28:56,161
Good night.

306
00:29:03,478 --> 00:29:07,005
What I'm saying is,
if you need any extra manpower...

307
00:29:07,448 --> 00:29:09,279
You're still talking.

308
00:29:15,022 --> 00:29:17,991
Did you forget about replacing
our broken toilet?

309
00:29:18,259 --> 00:29:19,624
Consider it done.

310
00:29:25,333 --> 00:29:27,563
Looks like a regular $20 bill, right?

311
00:29:34,075 --> 00:29:37,704
Sure, it's money, all right. Funny money.

312
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:43,446
This is Treasury File Number 6827.

313
00:29:43,718 --> 00:29:45,276
United States Secret Service.

314
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:49,286
The case of the disappearing serial number.

315
00:30:08,776 --> 00:30:10,710
Come on, get out of here.

316
00:30:13,414 --> 00:30:14,210
Go home.

317
00:32:10,798 --> 00:32:14,165
Looks like you have car trouble.
Want a jump?

318
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:22,205
That would be nice,
but I don't have any cables.

319
00:32:22,476 --> 00:32:24,341
I got cables. No problem.

320
00:32:26,948 --> 00:32:29,212
What the hell is that idiot doing?

321
00:32:29,617 --> 00:32:33,553
In a town like this,
if you see someone with car trouble...

322
00:32:33,654 --> 00:32:36,555
...you stop and help.
If you don't, it's suspicious.

323
00:32:40,494 --> 00:32:43,520
- Where you off to?
- I'm just going for a drive.

324
00:32:44,699 --> 00:32:46,530
It's a beautiful morning.

325
00:32:46,701 --> 00:32:49,499
Beautiful, yeah. Just going for a drive?

326
00:32:50,371 --> 00:32:52,339
No deliveries, no pick-ups?

327
00:32:56,911 --> 00:32:57,878
No.

328
00:32:58,379 --> 00:33:00,643
Just a drive.

329
00:33:05,586 --> 00:33:06,746
He's an idiot.

330
00:33:11,993 --> 00:33:13,620
Okay, start her up.

331
00:33:16,931 --> 00:33:19,491
Well, thanks for the start, neighbor.

332
00:33:19,734 --> 00:33:21,531
Sure, what are neighbors for?

333
00:33:24,805 --> 00:33:28,241
My hands are awfully greasy.
Can I use your bathroom?

334
00:33:30,811 --> 00:33:32,369
You want to use my bathroom?

335
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:34,375
Yeah, mine's on the fritz.

336
00:33:34,615 --> 00:33:37,914
Pipes are all clogged up
with dead gerbil or something.

337
00:33:40,688 --> 00:33:41,950
If it's any trouble...

338
00:33:43,891 --> 00:33:44,823
No.

339
00:33:49,263 --> 00:33:50,594
He's an idiot.

340
00:33:50,698 --> 00:33:54,828
He is not an idiot. He is having
a friendly chat, as he should be.

341
00:33:55,569 --> 00:33:57,867
He's going into the house.

342
00:34:02,443 --> 00:34:03,671
What an idiot!

343
00:34:06,981 --> 00:34:09,415
Boy, you keep the place nice and clean.

344
00:34:10,718 --> 00:34:12,447
A lot of my stuff hasn't come.

345
00:34:14,722 --> 00:34:15,950
I like it.

346
00:34:16,724 --> 00:34:20,455
There's clutter in my house.
I have furniture you could use.

347
00:34:22,596 --> 00:34:23,961
No, thanks.

348
00:34:24,398 --> 00:34:28,562
There's a nice Barcalounger.
The footstool doesn't pop out.

349
00:34:32,006 --> 00:34:34,702
The bathroom's down the hall.

350
00:34:37,078 --> 00:34:38,568
You need to get that?

351
00:34:39,613 --> 00:34:41,581
You go ahead, I can find it.

352
00:34:49,824 --> 00:34:50,984
Hello, friend.

353
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,455
Probably day after tomorrow.

354
00:34:54,762 --> 00:34:55,729
Contact.

355
00:34:56,030 --> 00:34:57,861
- Anyone we know?
- Lutz.

356
00:34:58,099 --> 00:35:01,626
I got your full order
in five different serial numbers.

357
00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:04,738
Still charge a dime on a dollar?

358
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:09,009
You know you're getting
some bargain here.

359
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:10,941
Like Caniff got when he blew up?

360
00:35:11,378 --> 00:35:12,743
I didn't blow him up.

361
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:16,008
I was as shocked
by what happened as you.

362
00:35:16,117 --> 00:35:18,950
He was supposed to meet me here,
at the house.

363
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,612
Where it's safe.

364
00:35:20,721 --> 00:35:24,316
That's right.
Safe as it gets in smiling suburbia.

365
00:35:24,658 --> 00:35:28,754
- Remember, no tricks.
- Right, no tricks. If you remember it.

366
00:35:29,864 --> 00:35:31,798
It's just you alone, right?

367
00:35:32,066 --> 00:35:33,499
Me and the money.

368
00:35:33,734 --> 00:35:34,928
That's good.

369
00:35:37,071 --> 00:35:39,631
None of your friends.

370
00:35:41,542 --> 00:35:42,941
Why are you so nervous?

371
00:35:43,043 --> 00:35:46,479
I'm not nervous, okay?
I just want us to be clear.

372
00:35:46,881 --> 00:35:49,782
No weapons. Both of us clean.

373
00:35:50,084 --> 00:35:52,644
That's what I want to hear. Okay?

374
00:36:07,701 --> 00:36:08,827
Came in yesterday.

375
00:36:09,436 --> 00:36:12,928
$50 bills in five separate serial numbers.

376
00:37:02,690 --> 00:37:04,715
I just want to be ready for you.

377
00:37:06,126 --> 00:37:11,029
Wait! Wait! What day?
Just tell me what day. Hello?

378
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,028
Bastard!

379
00:37:24,178 --> 00:37:27,147
Holy shit. Robberson's in the bedroom.

380
00:37:31,252 --> 00:37:33,516
I am going to kill him.

381
00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:37,617
What are you doing in here?

382
00:37:39,994 --> 00:37:41,052
I said:

383
00:37:42,062 --> 00:37:44,030
"What are you doing in here?"

384
00:37:44,198 --> 00:37:47,634
You said the bathroom was upstairs.
I can't find it.

385
00:37:47,868 --> 00:37:52,635
No, I said the bathroom was downstairs.
The guest bathroom is downstairs.

386
00:37:53,207 --> 00:37:55,675
I couldn't find it. I didn't know.

387
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:05,180
Who were you waving to?

388
00:38:07,755 --> 00:38:08,949
My house.

389
00:38:09,223 --> 00:38:12,659
Your house?
You were waving to your house?

390
00:38:13,727 --> 00:38:16,958
You can see it right through the window.
Hi, house.

391
00:38:18,832 --> 00:38:20,060
'Bye, house.

392
00:38:21,702 --> 00:38:25,661
Well, thanks for letting me clean up.
I can see myself out.

393
00:38:26,307 --> 00:38:27,831
Get down.

394
00:38:30,844 --> 00:38:31,970
Hey, Robberson...

395
00:38:35,182 --> 00:38:37,207
...you've probably lost this.

396
00:38:38,852 --> 00:38:42,583
Yeah, my tobacco pouch. Thanks.

397
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:43,688
Great.

398
00:38:43,857 --> 00:38:45,256
You don't seem like a smoker.

399
00:38:45,726 --> 00:38:48,593
Me? I'm a two-pack-a-day man.

400
00:38:48,796 --> 00:38:50,991
I love it. I should quit, but...

401
00:38:51,732 --> 00:38:53,825
Well, you must be dying for one.

402
00:38:54,001 --> 00:38:56,970
Dying is right. I know.
I know I should quit.

403
00:38:58,806 --> 00:39:00,171
Go ahead. I don't mind.

404
00:39:00,341 --> 00:39:02,002
I can wait until I get home.

405
00:39:02,209 --> 00:39:03,642
No, really, it's okay.

406
00:39:04,011 --> 00:39:07,242
- I'll wait till I get home.
- No, no, I insist.

407
00:39:07,748 --> 00:39:09,807
- Please.
- Smoke!

408
00:39:13,153 --> 00:39:15,053
This is a little difficult...

409
00:39:16,290 --> 00:39:17,882
...to do with one...

410
00:39:21,695 --> 00:39:23,162
I never learned to roll myself.

411
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:26,861
I learned this from a Rastafarian in college.

412
00:39:31,772 --> 00:39:33,137
Where was he from?

413
00:39:33,907 --> 00:39:35,738
Rastafaria.

414
00:39:41,181 --> 00:39:42,773
I've never been there.

415
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,052
I've lost my lighter.

416
00:39:48,122 --> 00:39:49,783
You've got my lighter.

417
00:40:10,010 --> 00:40:11,307
Pretty smooth.

418
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,206
You up there?

419
00:40:15,883 --> 00:40:17,783
You better take my gun.

420
00:40:19,686 --> 00:40:23,087
I parked around the block
so he wouldn't see me double back.

421
00:40:24,725 --> 00:40:25,657
Why are you down here?

422
00:40:25,759 --> 00:40:28,023
- What are you doing?
- Trying to help.

423
00:40:28,162 --> 00:40:31,188
Help? You could've blown
the whole stakeout.

424
00:40:48,849 --> 00:40:51,215
I thought you already left for work.

425
00:40:51,452 --> 00:40:54,717
I had some car trouble around the block.

426
00:40:56,390 --> 00:41:00,224
Where's your car?
Maybe there's something that I can do.

427
00:41:00,727 --> 00:41:02,957
That's so nice. I have AAA and...

428
00:41:03,197 --> 00:41:06,826
...they sent a tow truck.
To what do I owe the pleasure?

429
00:41:11,405 --> 00:41:13,305
Thanks. I almost forgot them.

430
00:41:15,876 --> 00:41:19,812
Since I'm already here,
why don't you show me around?

431
00:41:20,214 --> 00:41:21,841
After all, you saw my place.

432
00:41:22,082 --> 00:41:24,107
I'd love to, but...

433
00:41:24,885 --> 00:41:26,853
...I should get to work.

434
00:41:28,422 --> 00:41:31,118
Maybe your wife...

435
00:41:31,892 --> 00:41:33,382
...or kids can show me around.

436
00:41:35,229 --> 00:41:37,891
Helen's gone and the kids are in school.

437
00:41:38,031 --> 00:41:39,999
Then who was in the window?

438
00:41:41,835 --> 00:41:46,431
When we were in my bedroom,
I saw someone in the window.

439
00:41:49,443 --> 00:41:52,276
Him. That was my brother.

440
00:41:53,313 --> 00:41:54,871
Your brother.

441
00:41:57,184 --> 00:41:59,880
He's just in from Bos... Buffalo.

442
00:42:02,322 --> 00:42:03,755
You want to meet him?

443
00:42:04,057 --> 00:42:05,285
He's a great guy.

444
00:42:06,326 --> 00:42:07,884
Jake, come on down!

445
00:42:08,128 --> 00:42:09,789
Come on, don't be shy.

446
00:42:10,063 --> 00:42:14,159
Come down and meet my neighbor.
He lives next door, coincidentally.

447
00:42:14,801 --> 00:42:16,428
Jake, come on down.

448
00:42:29,283 --> 00:42:31,183
This is my older brother, Jake.

449
00:42:32,286 --> 00:42:36,120
I'm his older brother, Jake.
I'm visiting from Buffalo.

450
00:42:36,223 --> 00:42:37,918
Visiting from Buffalo.

451
00:42:42,496 --> 00:42:44,191
Buffalo, New York.

452
00:42:48,835 --> 00:42:50,462
That Buffalo, yeah.

453
00:42:58,278 --> 00:42:59,472
What was that?

454
00:43:01,381 --> 00:43:04,544
- That's nobody, really.
- There's somebody up there.

455
00:43:04,851 --> 00:43:06,341
No, that's just Tony.

456
00:43:06,987 --> 00:43:09,080
Tony, you want to meet my neighbor?

457
00:43:23,537 --> 00:43:25,869
Tony is...

458
00:43:26,073 --> 00:43:28,268
- My boyfriend.
- Cindy's boyfriend.

459
00:43:32,346 --> 00:43:35,838
We better get going.
We're already late for school.

460
00:43:36,416 --> 00:43:38,850
Yeah, right, school.

461
00:43:40,454 --> 00:43:42,081
Great to see you again.

462
00:43:42,222 --> 00:43:43,519
Nice seeing you. Come back again.

463
00:43:43,624 --> 00:43:45,023
Oh, sure.

464
00:43:46,426 --> 00:43:49,122
Let's go, we don't want to be late.

465
00:43:49,630 --> 00:43:51,291
'Bye, Uncle Jake.

466
00:43:51,898 --> 00:43:52,990
'Bye.

467
00:43:55,302 --> 00:43:57,532
'Bye, Niece Cindy.

468
00:43:58,639 --> 00:44:00,163
Take care of my daughter.

469
00:44:00,307 --> 00:44:01,535
Right.

470
00:44:10,050 --> 00:44:12,450
You got a pretty full house this week.

471
00:44:12,653 --> 00:44:16,054
Maybe I'll get the grand tour another day.

472
00:44:17,190 --> 00:44:19,556
Sure thing. Drop by again.

473
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:21,984
Mr. Henderson.

474
00:44:25,332 --> 00:44:27,425
Did my brother bother you?

475
00:44:27,934 --> 00:44:29,162
What do you mean?

476
00:44:29,336 --> 00:44:32,430
I don't know. Being nosey?
Snooping around?

477
00:44:32,939 --> 00:44:35,339
Acting like a moron?

478
00:44:39,946 --> 00:44:40,935
Yeah, a little.

479
00:44:42,949 --> 00:44:47,477
He's having trouble acclimating.
He's only been out a couple of weeks.

480
00:44:51,391 --> 00:44:52,221
Out?

481
00:44:52,959 --> 00:44:54,483
Out of the sanitarium.

482
00:44:55,362 --> 00:44:57,455
You didn't notice the scars?

483
00:45:00,367 --> 00:45:01,959
No. Come on.

484
00:45:02,302 --> 00:45:05,362
I guess his hair is growing back in.

485
00:45:07,374 --> 00:45:08,636
You mean they...

486
00:45:14,648 --> 00:45:18,345
At least he's harmless now.

487
00:45:22,122 --> 00:45:25,353
Wait, he goes to work every day.

488
00:45:25,659 --> 00:45:27,092
Work?

489
00:45:28,595 --> 00:45:31,996
He drives downtown,
sits on a park bench...

490
00:45:32,399 --> 00:45:35,095
...and drools for eight hours.

491
00:45:38,338 --> 00:45:43,037
If he gives you any more trouble,
you call me, huh?

492
00:45:45,145 --> 00:45:46,635
That is really sad.

493
00:45:48,014 --> 00:45:49,379
Life is...

494
00:45:51,418 --> 00:45:52,510
...sad.

495
00:45:56,156 --> 00:45:57,987
The poor guy drools.

496
00:45:58,291 --> 00:45:59,656
Your brother?

497
00:46:01,027 --> 00:46:02,995
You said I had a lobotomy.

498
00:46:04,064 --> 00:46:05,554
Better than being your brother.

499
00:46:10,303 --> 00:46:11,998
So, why did you do that?

500
00:46:12,305 --> 00:46:16,264
I had to do something.
I mean, you guys were dying in there.

501
00:46:16,409 --> 00:46:19,435
That was good. It was really good.

502
00:46:20,313 --> 00:46:22,008
You sound surprised.

503
00:46:22,315 --> 00:46:26,581
None of the girls I know
would have been that smart.

504
00:46:27,053 --> 00:46:29,180
You don't know me.

505
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:37,185
Now, there are certain things that we...

506
00:46:37,531 --> 00:46:39,590
I'm sorry, Jake, it's hot.

507
00:46:40,534 --> 00:46:43,697
...as law enforcing professionals
may have taken for granted...

508
00:46:43,804 --> 00:46:45,738
...that you lay people...

509
00:46:46,473 --> 00:46:50,432
...maybe didn't quite understand.
Now, for example...

510
00:46:50,610 --> 00:46:53,443
...when staking out a dangerous criminal...

511
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:54,612
Thank you.

512
00:46:54,714 --> 00:46:56,773
...it is generally a good idea...

513
00:46:57,617 --> 00:47:00,177
...to stay out of his damned house!

514
00:47:01,721 --> 00:47:04,656
- Talk about beating a dead horse.
- No harm was done.

515
00:47:04,825 --> 00:47:06,622
No harm done?

516
00:47:07,394 --> 00:47:08,656
But they've seen us.

517
00:47:08,762 --> 00:47:10,593
They don't know who you are.

518
00:47:11,565 --> 00:47:15,194
Now that Osborn thinks we belong,
we can't be relieved.

519
00:47:15,435 --> 00:47:20,372
That's right. So I am stuck here
on a 24-hour basis...

520
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:24,337
...playing the role of the uncle from Buffalo.

521
00:47:27,581 --> 00:47:29,811
I'm sorry your plans have changed...

522
00:47:30,317 --> 00:47:35,220
...but we're happy to have you here.
I made your favorite: Kung Pao Pork.

523
00:47:35,388 --> 00:47:37,754
This shouldn't be a dinner party.

524
00:47:38,191 --> 00:47:41,592
We have an expense account,
so we can grab Burger King.

525
00:47:41,728 --> 00:47:43,491
Not while you're in my house.

526
00:47:43,830 --> 00:47:46,628
- Give me your plate.
- At least let me help out.

527
00:47:46,733 --> 00:47:50,499
I could do the dishes.
Jake would be happy to mow the lawn.

528
00:47:50,670 --> 00:47:51,398
Thanks, Jake.

529
00:47:51,671 --> 00:47:55,402
Wait a minute.
Wait one cotton-picking minute.

530
00:47:55,775 --> 00:47:58,073
- You don't give me orders.
- I didn't.

531
00:47:58,278 --> 00:48:02,578
Jake's right. He's a proud man
and you put him in an awkward position.

532
00:48:02,816 --> 00:48:05,148
Even if he wanted to mow the lawn...

533
00:48:05,218 --> 00:48:07,846
...it will seem it's because you told him to.

534
00:48:08,622 --> 00:48:10,783
I'm sorry. Let's eat, okay?

535
00:48:11,224 --> 00:48:12,816
You can pass the petits fours.

536
00:48:13,159 --> 00:48:16,253
Don't have one
until you finish your sandwich.

537
00:48:16,897 --> 00:48:18,524
Mrs. Robberson...

538
00:48:19,432 --> 00:48:20,660
...listen to me.

539
00:48:21,768 --> 00:48:25,431
I don't mow lawns. I never mowed lawns.

540
00:48:25,872 --> 00:48:27,533
I never had a lawn.

541
00:48:28,174 --> 00:48:29,607
And if I had a lawn...

542
00:48:30,777 --> 00:48:32,438
...I'd kill it.

543
00:48:38,885 --> 00:48:41,183
Holy jumping Jesus!

544
00:48:43,723 --> 00:48:45,554
Goddamn bastard!

545
00:48:53,266 --> 00:48:54,563
You dirty...

546
00:48:56,336 --> 00:48:57,826
Jesus Christ!

547
00:49:02,342 --> 00:49:04,606
You miserable son of a bitch.

548
00:49:05,211 --> 00:49:06,303
What?

549
00:49:06,613 --> 00:49:09,173
Do you have to use that language?

550
00:49:09,616 --> 00:49:11,311
What language?

551
00:49:12,886 --> 00:49:17,721
It's not very attractive.
I mean, do you think it's really attractive?

552
00:49:18,758 --> 00:49:20,191
It's not.

553
00:49:26,766 --> 00:49:27,733
There.

554
00:49:28,234 --> 00:49:32,694
Eleven single-typed pages stating
Osborn has a room full of lawn furniture...

555
00:49:32,839 --> 00:49:36,502
...and has ordered 12 mattresses.
We're getting nowhere.

556
00:49:36,776 --> 00:49:38,243
We'll get there.

557
00:49:38,912 --> 00:49:39,879
It's funny.

558
00:49:40,246 --> 00:49:44,615
The reason we know what we do
about Osborn is because of Robberson.

559
00:49:45,652 --> 00:49:47,244
That's hilarious.

560
00:49:49,723 --> 00:49:52,248
Doesn't this kid ever go out to play?

561
00:49:52,959 --> 00:49:55,393
Listen, son.

562
00:49:59,666 --> 00:50:00,928
You're getting spooked.

563
00:50:05,271 --> 00:50:07,239
Go away, kid. Go on.

564
00:50:08,808 --> 00:50:13,768
I'm sorry my son jumped on you,
bit your neck and tried to suck your blood.

565
00:50:14,547 --> 00:50:15,912
It happens.

566
00:50:17,417 --> 00:50:20,511
You can't behave like that. It's not polite.

567
00:50:23,690 --> 00:50:25,385
Can't you do something?

568
00:50:25,825 --> 00:50:27,793
The vampire game was fun for a while...

569
00:50:29,295 --> 00:50:33,925
...but we're losing a lot of blood around
the house, so we should try a new game.

570
00:50:43,309 --> 00:50:44,936
He doesn't listen to me.

571
00:50:52,419 --> 00:50:55,320
Hey, kid.
What the hell do you want from me?

572
00:51:05,698 --> 00:51:06,790
How's it going?

573
00:51:12,038 --> 00:51:13,938
My son thinks he's a vampire.

574
00:51:14,707 --> 00:51:15,935
No shit.

575
00:51:18,978 --> 00:51:20,673
I don't know what to do.

576
00:51:21,581 --> 00:51:25,813
You've only been here a few days
and already they listen to you.

577
00:51:27,554 --> 00:51:28,885
They respect you.

578
00:51:29,823 --> 00:51:31,347
What time is it?

579
00:51:31,724 --> 00:51:33,624
It's a quarter to three.

580
00:51:36,329 --> 00:51:39,298
Quarter to three, no one in the place.

581
00:51:43,870 --> 00:51:45,838
"It's a quarter to three

582
00:51:46,473 --> 00:51:48,703
"There's no one in the place

583
00:51:49,008 --> 00:51:50,441
"Except

584
00:51:50,677 --> 00:51:53,339
"you and me

585
00:51:54,848 --> 00:51:57,510
"We're drinking, my friend

586
00:51:58,885 --> 00:52:03,447
"to the end of a brief episode

587
00:52:05,125 --> 00:52:08,390
"Make it one for my baby

588
00:52:09,028 --> 00:52:12,862
"And one more for the road

589
00:52:15,135 --> 00:52:17,865
"That long

590
00:52:18,037 --> 00:52:19,334
"long

591
00:52:20,039 --> 00:52:22,007
"road"

592
00:52:29,516 --> 00:52:30,744
Don't touch me.

593
00:52:34,721 --> 00:52:36,814
Did you ever catch a bank robber?

594
00:52:39,058 --> 00:52:40,082
Yeah.

595
00:52:40,527 --> 00:52:42,392
You ever been in a car chase?

596
00:52:43,663 --> 00:52:44,755
Yeah.

597
00:52:46,166 --> 00:52:47,758
You ever been shot at?

598
00:52:52,539 --> 00:52:54,905
Listen to Uncle Jake's cool stories.

599
00:52:55,808 --> 00:52:56,797
Look.

600
00:52:58,511 --> 00:53:00,706
Our family's having breakfast together.

601
00:53:00,947 --> 00:53:04,644
Uncle Jake,
how long have you known Tony?

602
00:53:06,085 --> 00:53:07,052
Too long.

603
00:53:15,061 --> 00:53:16,585
Blood and brains.

604
00:53:17,063 --> 00:53:18,462
May I have some?

605
00:53:20,967 --> 00:53:22,400
Get your own.

606
00:53:25,972 --> 00:53:28,065
It's a beautiful morning, isn't it?

607
00:53:30,843 --> 00:53:32,970
- That Tony's?
- Yes.

608
00:53:42,088 --> 00:53:43,419
'Morning.

609
00:53:49,229 --> 00:53:50,992
I've got to catch up with Tim.

610
00:53:51,097 --> 00:53:52,155
See you.

611
00:53:52,599 --> 00:53:55,090
Yeah, and I got to get to Jenny's, so...

612
00:53:58,004 --> 00:53:59,835
Well, good-bye.

613
00:54:04,877 --> 00:54:07,903
Well, for about 30 seconds
our life was perfect.

614
00:54:15,622 --> 00:54:17,988
Bathroom time is up, Uncle Jake.

615
00:54:18,625 --> 00:54:22,061
Come on. I just got in here.

616
00:54:22,629 --> 00:54:25,723
- Sorry.
- Five more minutes.

617
00:54:25,898 --> 00:54:29,459
I'll sell you my time slot, 9:30 to 9:45.

618
00:54:29,636 --> 00:54:30,625
How much?

619
00:54:32,505 --> 00:54:33,597
$5.

620
00:54:36,509 --> 00:54:37,476
$1.

621
00:54:38,044 --> 00:54:40,740
$5 or get off the pot.

622
00:54:41,781 --> 00:54:43,749
You little bastard.

623
00:54:45,518 --> 00:54:48,954
Marva Prescott for Street Cops.
The patrolman's job...

624
00:54:49,055 --> 00:54:52,684
...is often routine, and yet,
with every routine stop...

625
00:54:53,059 --> 00:54:58,019
...he knows that around any corner
might be a bullet with his name on it.

626
00:54:58,665 --> 00:55:02,226
The magnetic strip on the back
is much like your ATM card.

627
00:55:02,669 --> 00:55:06,070
We run it through and once the information
reaches the station...

628
00:55:06,172 --> 00:55:10,131
...we get a computer print-out
of any outstanding warrants.

629
00:55:15,648 --> 00:55:17,513
He looks younger every day.

630
00:55:19,052 --> 00:55:20,542
Coming to bed?

631
00:55:20,653 --> 00:55:23,781
I want to finish typing Cindy's paper
on Harriet Tubman.

632
00:55:24,957 --> 00:55:27,187
You know, it's really wonderful.

633
00:55:28,695 --> 00:55:29,662
Yes!

634
00:55:30,029 --> 00:55:34,864
It seems like yesterday I made her
that dancing-seaweed costume...

635
00:55:34,967 --> 00:55:37,527
...for her first-grade play
on life in the tide pools.

636
00:55:37,704 --> 00:55:39,604
They're growing up so fast.

637
00:55:40,707 --> 00:55:42,607
- Billy's doing better.
- He is?

638
00:55:42,709 --> 00:55:45,075
He's coming out of his box more and more.

639
00:55:45,178 --> 00:55:48,204
Not all the way out,
but he's looking around.

640
00:55:48,681 --> 00:55:50,876
I think that's Jake's influence.

641
00:55:51,718 --> 00:55:53,208
Jake's a hell of a guy.

642
00:55:53,986 --> 00:55:57,547
He is. I think he's really good for the kids.

643
00:55:57,824 --> 00:56:00,156
I'll have him talk to Kevin about smoking.

644
00:56:00,593 --> 00:56:01,890
I already did that.

645
00:56:02,061 --> 00:56:04,621
I know that, honey, but he respects Jake.

646
00:56:06,733 --> 00:56:08,223
Good point.

647
00:56:09,068 --> 00:56:13,562
No, I didn't mean it like that.
I meant that he'll listen to Jake.

648
00:56:14,140 --> 00:56:15,971
A father wants to hear that.

649
00:56:17,076 --> 00:56:18,805
I didn't mean it that way.

650
00:56:22,949 --> 00:56:24,917
You'll make me miss the ending.

651
00:56:29,889 --> 00:56:32,255
Would you rather be watching Colombo?

652
00:56:32,392 --> 00:56:35,919
Don't be silly. Colombo is on Thursdays.

653
00:56:37,029 --> 00:56:38,724
Oh, boy.

654
00:56:39,165 --> 00:56:42,726
I could sleep for a million years.

655
00:56:44,771 --> 00:56:45,999
All right!

656
00:56:46,305 --> 00:56:47,795
That's it.

657
00:57:04,424 --> 00:57:05,789
Had to be done.

658
00:57:08,060 --> 00:57:10,290
That was great, Uncle Jake.

659
00:57:10,696 --> 00:57:13,028
Billy, you sure you're okay?

660
00:57:13,199 --> 00:57:14,757
No sweat.

661
00:57:15,802 --> 00:57:17,895
Jake, you got ketchup all over him.

662
00:57:18,070 --> 00:57:19,765
What do you want to play now?

663
00:57:19,939 --> 00:57:21,304
Thank you very much.

664
00:57:22,208 --> 00:57:24,836
I just wanted to get him to leave me alone.

665
00:57:35,021 --> 00:57:36,318
Jake? Tony?

666
00:57:37,290 --> 00:57:39,986
I'm in the bathroom.
I'll be there in a minute.

667
00:58:05,051 --> 00:58:06,018
Freeze!

668
00:58:06,152 --> 00:58:07,380
I said, "Freeze!"

669
00:58:10,256 --> 00:58:13,953
Detective Norman Stone.
Put your hands up and spread 'em.

670
00:58:14,193 --> 00:58:15,956
I said, "Spread 'em!"

671
00:58:19,732 --> 00:58:21,097
You talking to me?

672
00:58:22,268 --> 00:58:23,963
You talking to me?

673
00:58:26,138 --> 00:58:27,833
You talk me?

674
00:58:28,207 --> 00:58:29,902
You? Me?

675
00:58:32,979 --> 00:58:34,037
Norman.

676
00:58:38,985 --> 00:58:42,352
"Happy birthday to you

677
00:58:42,855 --> 00:58:46,154
"Happy birthday to you

678
00:58:46,526 --> 00:58:50,257
"Happy birthday, dear Jake

679
00:58:50,463 --> 00:58:53,364
"Happy birthday to you"

680
00:59:00,172 --> 00:59:04,006
Blow out your candles
and then you can open your present.

681
00:59:04,510 --> 00:59:06,944
If you don't blow them out, I will.

682
00:59:08,047 --> 00:59:11,141
There. Now make a wish.
Come on, make a wish.

683
00:59:11,250 --> 00:59:13,184
You're not making a wish.

684
00:59:13,886 --> 00:59:15,080
I wish...

685
00:59:17,323 --> 00:59:19,382
...that you'd leave me alone.

686
00:59:35,808 --> 00:59:37,776
We'll just eat it without him.

687
00:59:40,246 --> 00:59:41,372
You okay, Mom?

688
01:00:40,006 --> 01:00:42,566
Freeze! Hands up! You're under arrest!

689
01:00:47,179 --> 01:00:48,146
Pow!

690
01:00:48,614 --> 01:00:51,947
I've been shot! Call the paramedics!

691
01:00:52,118 --> 01:00:53,449
- Guess what.
- Call 911.

692
01:00:53,552 --> 01:00:56,248
- Our bathroom's fixed.
- No way. Our bathroom?

693
01:00:56,489 --> 01:00:59,322
Oh, this is so cool. Look at this.

694
01:01:00,159 --> 01:01:01,251
Mom, look.

695
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:02,588
Check it out.

696
01:01:03,162 --> 01:01:04,993
Great! Norman.

697
01:01:05,431 --> 01:01:08,264
Norman, did you see what Jake did?

698
01:01:09,568 --> 01:01:11,001
The toilet?

699
01:01:11,303 --> 01:01:16,070
Yes, that means we have two that work.
We're a normal family again.

700
01:01:16,208 --> 01:01:18,540
Hands up! Don't make me use this!

701
01:01:20,913 --> 01:01:22,278
You okay, Dad?

702
01:01:23,315 --> 01:01:25,215
Yeah, fine.

703
01:01:26,452 --> 01:01:28,420
Do you want to talk about it?

704
01:01:29,021 --> 01:01:30,488
No, I'm fine.

705
01:01:31,257 --> 01:01:34,158
I used to get sad sometimes, too.

706
01:01:36,328 --> 01:01:40,094
When I was little,
I thought people liked Kevin more than me.

707
01:01:40,466 --> 01:01:42,161
Don't be silly.

708
01:01:42,401 --> 01:01:45,632
Because he could do so many cool things.

709
01:01:46,172 --> 01:01:49,039
Then I realized, "Hey, I'm only five. "

710
01:01:50,476 --> 01:01:52,103
How old are you, Dad?

711
01:01:52,978 --> 01:01:54,240
I'm about 12.

712
01:01:58,484 --> 01:02:00,452
Mind if I play with Uncle Jake?

713
01:02:00,686 --> 01:02:02,119
No, go ahead.

714
01:02:04,623 --> 01:02:08,059
Uncle Jake, want to come outside
and play with me?

715
01:02:08,194 --> 01:02:10,162
Yeah, let me finish this coffee.

716
01:02:10,496 --> 01:02:12,930
Whatever you say, Uncle Jake.

717
01:02:13,499 --> 01:02:14,932
Uncle Jake.

718
01:02:27,646 --> 01:02:30,080
7-8-5-1, family dispute.

719
01:02:42,261 --> 01:02:43,956
Now, please listen.

720
01:02:44,530 --> 01:02:48,557
I want a bagel with no cream cheese,
just butter, okay?

721
01:02:48,734 --> 01:02:50,429
No cream cheese, whatsoever.

722
01:02:50,669 --> 01:02:51,658
Right.

723
01:02:52,004 --> 01:02:53,665
Maybe you better write it down.

724
01:02:54,473 --> 01:02:55,565
Maybe.

725
01:02:57,276 --> 01:02:58,971
Bagel for the counter.

726
01:03:10,189 --> 01:03:11,281
Enjoy.

727
01:03:18,030 --> 01:03:19,122
Okay.

728
01:03:19,298 --> 01:03:23,462
I'll pay for this bagel,
but you'll never see me in here again.

729
01:03:23,769 --> 01:03:25,634
Yeah, you're breaking my heart.

730
01:03:25,738 --> 01:03:28,571
And if you want a tip, I got news for you.

731
01:03:38,717 --> 01:03:40,116
You're under arrest.

732
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:43,151
Gee, I'm scared!

733
01:03:45,191 --> 01:03:47,625
You want to hurry? You're backing me up.

734
01:03:47,793 --> 01:03:50,284
Give me potato salad.
Where's the pickles?

735
01:03:51,063 --> 01:03:54,396
We need pickles. Not coleslaw,
I said potato salad.

736
01:03:55,100 --> 01:03:57,591
Did you hear me? I said potato salad.

737
01:03:58,237 --> 01:03:59,761
You're under arrest. Freeze!

738
01:04:00,072 --> 01:04:02,040
- He has a knife!
- No, a gun!

739
01:04:02,141 --> 01:04:04,632
- Don't shoot.
- Put your hands behind my back.

740
01:04:05,077 --> 01:04:07,568
No, straight up. Reach for the tiling.

741
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:09,170
Relax, everybody.

742
01:04:10,349 --> 01:04:13,182
The show's over.
Detective Norm Stone here.

743
01:04:13,485 --> 01:04:17,319
Stick your hands behind your back.
Don't try anything.

744
01:04:42,514 --> 01:04:44,209
I want to see a lawyer.

745
01:04:48,387 --> 01:04:50,355
You arrested a waiter?

746
01:04:51,257 --> 01:04:52,485
That's right.

747
01:04:53,525 --> 01:04:55,220
May I ask why?

748
01:04:57,830 --> 01:04:59,559
One thing, his service stunk.

749
01:04:59,798 --> 01:05:01,288
It stunk!

750
01:05:01,734 --> 01:05:02,826
Come here.

751
01:05:04,870 --> 01:05:06,838
You're nuts, do you know that?

752
01:05:08,274 --> 01:05:10,242
Jake, he was rude.

753
01:05:10,409 --> 01:05:12,639
You can't arrest people for being rude.

754
01:05:12,878 --> 01:05:16,507
If we did, all of New York City
would be on death row.

755
01:05:16,815 --> 01:05:19,181
I have a hunch about this guy.

756
01:05:19,418 --> 01:05:20,442
A what?

757
01:05:20,619 --> 01:05:23,782
A hunch. You know,
like a cop kind of a hunch.

758
01:05:24,290 --> 01:05:26,850
Let's take him downtown
and interrogate him.

759
01:05:27,293 --> 01:05:31,787
But he's not hiding anything.
Stop talking like a dumb TV detective.

760
01:05:31,897 --> 01:05:36,630
- You be good cop, I'm bad cop.
- You are not a cop!

761
01:05:37,436 --> 01:05:42,339
Give me my badge
and the key to the cuffs.

762
01:05:54,320 --> 01:05:55,378
Now, get in.

763
01:05:55,521 --> 01:05:56,749
Get in!

764
01:05:57,456 --> 01:05:59,549
- Just look at...
- Get in!

765
01:06:00,893 --> 01:06:01,917
Stay!

766
01:06:03,729 --> 01:06:05,162
Quiet!

767
01:06:07,733 --> 01:06:10,759
- Just check his file.
- Don't say another word.

768
01:06:10,936 --> 01:06:15,566
If I even see you breathe,
I'll shoot you myself.

769
01:06:39,832 --> 01:06:41,390
How you doing tonight?

770
01:06:41,533 --> 01:06:44,366
How am I doing? I'm suing.

771
01:06:44,770 --> 01:06:47,864
Yeah, I'm suing him. I'm suing you.

772
01:06:48,307 --> 01:06:50,798
I'm suing the entire police department!

773
01:06:51,276 --> 01:06:53,870
That's how I'm doing tonight.

774
01:07:05,724 --> 01:07:07,214
What's your badge number?

775
01:07:30,949 --> 01:07:34,783
I can't believe this is possible
in a democratic society.

776
01:07:35,287 --> 01:07:37,915
I've had it with you
and your stupid partner.

777
01:07:38,357 --> 01:07:41,622
You're finished.
You'll be a K-Mart security guard...

778
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:43,455
...when I'm done with you!

779
01:07:43,829 --> 01:07:46,855
- Take it easy, sir. These mistakes...
- Jake?

780
01:08:00,045 --> 01:08:01,012
What?

781
01:08:01,847 --> 01:08:02,939
What?

782
01:08:04,049 --> 01:08:05,676
Book him, Danno.

783
01:08:11,323 --> 01:08:13,416
Arresting officer, Jake Stone.

784
01:08:13,525 --> 01:08:17,359
- I want to report a stolen car.
- Take a number.

785
01:08:19,865 --> 01:08:22,959
It's the biggest car-theft ring in the valley.

786
01:08:23,502 --> 01:08:24,901
How did you make him?

787
01:08:25,037 --> 01:08:28,598
Get your hands off of me!
I said get 'em off me!

788
01:08:31,009 --> 01:08:32,704
It was a hunch.

789
01:08:33,345 --> 01:08:34,835
That was so great.

790
01:08:35,013 --> 01:08:36,605
You got lucky, Norman.

791
01:08:36,748 --> 01:08:40,582
It wasn't luck, Jake.
I was born to be a cop.

792
01:08:42,821 --> 01:08:45,312
This was the most exciting day of my life.

793
01:08:46,358 --> 01:08:48,588
You think being a cop is exciting?

794
01:08:48,760 --> 01:08:54,528
I know it's not all excitement
like Starsky and Hutch and T.J. Hooker.

795
01:08:54,666 --> 01:08:58,568
A lot of it's tedious and bureaucratic,
like in Law and Order.

796
01:08:58,704 --> 01:09:01,036
It's nothing like television.

797
01:09:09,781 --> 01:09:11,874
I'll tell you what it's like.

798
01:09:18,924 --> 01:09:22,360
It's being afraid of dying
every second of every day.

799
01:09:25,531 --> 01:09:27,021
Do you understand that?

800
01:09:30,869 --> 01:09:33,030
You stole my badge, Norman.

801
01:09:34,006 --> 01:09:36,099
Yeah, I'm sorry.

802
01:09:36,808 --> 01:09:40,642
They could've busted me for what you did.
I could've lost my pension.

803
01:09:42,014 --> 01:09:43,777
Then what the hell would I do?

804
01:09:45,417 --> 01:09:49,649
Jesus, I'm sorry, Jake.
Is there anything I can do?

805
01:09:51,690 --> 01:09:53,658
Get the hell out of my life.

806
01:09:58,030 --> 01:09:59,998
I can understand that, but...

807
01:10:00,432 --> 01:10:01,660
But what?

808
01:10:02,167 --> 01:10:04,067
You're living in my house.

809
01:10:06,638 --> 01:10:08,538
I'll show you something great.

810
01:10:09,041 --> 01:10:12,602
This one's cool.
This is an X-ray scope. I can see...

811
01:10:12,978 --> 01:10:14,605
Stop that.

812
01:10:16,848 --> 01:10:18,406
Jake!

813
01:10:18,850 --> 01:10:20,943
That was quick. You're back, huh?

814
01:10:22,120 --> 01:10:25,089
My shift, smoke them if you got them.

815
01:10:25,991 --> 01:10:28,425
He's been in the house all day.

816
01:10:28,727 --> 01:10:30,558
Do you mind if we go for a drive?

817
01:10:32,598 --> 01:10:35,965
I'll be 20 minutes. I'm starving.
I'll bring the beeper.

818
01:10:36,468 --> 01:10:37,696
Do you want anything?

819
01:10:38,470 --> 01:10:40,700
Yeah, bring me some fries.

820
01:11:09,668 --> 01:11:11,659
- You got one for me?
- No.

821
01:11:12,004 --> 01:11:13,835
Come on, don't be like Dad.

822
01:11:16,675 --> 01:11:18,836
Me and your dad are nothing alike.

823
01:11:18,977 --> 01:11:20,501
There's a shocker.

824
01:11:22,981 --> 01:11:26,917
Your dad doesn't want you to smoke
because he's afraid you'll get cancer.

825
01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:31,489
I don't want you to have it
because it's my last one.

826
01:11:32,724 --> 01:11:35,591
The difference between me and him is...

827
01:11:36,128 --> 01:11:38,187
...I don't give a shit about you...

828
01:11:41,533 --> 01:11:43,000
...and he does.

829
01:11:46,838 --> 01:11:47,930
We're leaving.

830
01:11:48,073 --> 01:11:49,938
Why? What are you afraid of?

831
01:11:50,242 --> 01:11:53,939
I'm afraid of the moral implications
of your dress.

832
01:11:58,116 --> 01:12:01,677
I'm not a child. I'm a grown woman.

833
01:12:02,921 --> 01:12:06,288
Do you know what it's like
to be trapped in this teenage body?

834
01:12:07,559 --> 01:12:09,026
I'm imagining it.

835
01:12:12,964 --> 01:12:14,158
Jesus, Tony!

836
01:12:16,735 --> 01:12:20,899
That's my gun.
You don't need to be afraid of it.

837
01:12:21,106 --> 01:12:23,199
You just need to know how to use it.

838
01:12:24,076 --> 01:12:25,907
You want me to show you how to use it?

839
01:12:27,612 --> 01:12:28,579
Sure.

840
01:12:31,083 --> 01:12:32,744
I'll get rid of the bullets.

841
01:12:51,937 --> 01:12:52,904
Yeah.

842
01:12:53,004 --> 01:12:54,232
Hello, friend.

843
01:12:54,973 --> 01:12:55,997
Is that you?

844
01:12:58,210 --> 01:13:01,111
I didn't want to drop in
without calling first.

845
01:13:01,880 --> 01:13:04,644
That's smart.

846
01:13:05,183 --> 01:13:07,879
- You alone?
- Isn't that what you wanted?

847
01:13:08,787 --> 01:13:10,311
If I didn't know better...

848
01:13:10,989 --> 01:13:13,014
...I'd think you didn't trust me.

849
01:13:13,892 --> 01:13:15,587
Of course I trust you.

850
01:13:16,128 --> 01:13:18,358
Why wouldn't I trust you?

851
01:13:19,231 --> 01:13:21,995
You got the stuff?

852
01:13:23,135 --> 01:13:25,296
I got everything you need, pal.

853
01:13:25,804 --> 01:13:29,706
That's good because
I got everything you need, too.

854
01:13:30,842 --> 01:13:33,106
So, why don't you come in?

855
01:13:33,412 --> 01:13:34,709
Great.

856
01:13:48,427 --> 01:13:49,689
Tony.

857
01:13:52,831 --> 01:13:54,662
Where the hell are you, Tony?

858
01:13:56,034 --> 01:13:58,195
If Jake saw this, I'd be dead.

859
01:14:06,011 --> 01:14:06,978
It's going down.

860
01:14:12,784 --> 01:14:15,412
Everything is set up downstairs.

861
01:14:15,854 --> 01:14:18,288
I'd like to use the john first.

862
01:14:19,191 --> 01:14:22,922
Good. The bathroom is downstairs.

863
01:14:25,864 --> 01:14:26,956
Lead the way.

864
01:14:27,732 --> 01:14:28,960
My pleasure.

865
01:14:33,738 --> 01:14:35,103
You going to get that?

866
01:14:36,208 --> 01:14:38,870
It's probably somebody selling something.

867
01:14:39,411 --> 01:14:41,038
It might be important.

868
01:14:45,317 --> 01:14:46,716
I'll get rid of them.

869
01:14:47,085 --> 01:14:48,780
I'll find my own way.

870
01:14:51,490 --> 01:14:53,185
No.

871
01:14:54,092 --> 01:14:58,188
It's very tricky down there, you know?

872
01:14:58,497 --> 01:15:04,367
I'll get you some Taster's Choice and relax.

873
01:15:12,143 --> 01:15:13,110
What?

874
01:15:13,211 --> 01:15:16,044
Is this Mr. John Henderson?

875
01:15:16,114 --> 01:15:19,140
Yes, but I don't accept phone solicitations.

876
01:15:19,518 --> 01:15:21,486
No, Mr. Henderson.

877
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:25,412
I'm calling to offer you a free trip to Maui.

878
01:15:25,857 --> 01:15:27,324
I don't care what it is.

879
01:15:27,926 --> 01:15:29,325
Did you say Maui?

880
01:15:30,262 --> 01:15:32,924
Maui, huh? I heard of that.

881
01:15:33,265 --> 01:15:35,927
That's one of the less developed islands.

882
01:15:37,369 --> 01:15:40,099
You're under arrest. Freeze!

883
01:15:40,338 --> 01:15:41,430
Spread 'em!

884
01:15:41,940 --> 01:15:43,908
Go away, you stupid little kid.

885
01:15:44,142 --> 01:15:48,101
I'm not a little kid!
I'm a cop, like my Uncle Jake.

886
01:15:56,555 --> 01:15:59,524
You know, I've never won anything before.

887
01:15:59,958 --> 01:16:01,323
Can I bring a guest?

888
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:05,121
Do you have a credit card with you?

889
01:16:05,397 --> 01:16:08,366
Well, no, I don't have it with me, but...

890
01:16:08,900 --> 01:16:11,061
Then forget the trip, you asshole!

891
01:16:16,374 --> 01:16:18,535
How long has Uncle Jake
been staying with you?

892
01:16:18,877 --> 01:16:20,310
About five days.

893
01:16:21,580 --> 01:16:23,207
Is the kid bothering you?

894
01:16:23,415 --> 01:16:26,475
- First he's a vampire, now this.
- Hi, Uncle Jake.

895
01:16:26,918 --> 01:16:28,385
He's a handful. Hi.

896
01:16:28,553 --> 01:16:31,784
Billy, it's time for bed.

897
01:16:32,123 --> 01:16:34,216
That's all right, Uncle Jake.

898
01:16:42,901 --> 01:16:44,994
You said this place was clean.

899
01:16:45,337 --> 01:16:46,998
Yeah, it is.

900
01:16:47,272 --> 01:16:49,968
Then why is there a stakeout next door?

901
01:16:51,109 --> 01:16:53,270
I'm taking you to find out
what you got on us.

902
01:16:53,445 --> 01:16:56,039
You stay here and watch the kid.

903
01:16:57,082 --> 01:16:58,913
Don't worry about him.
He has his own gun.

904
01:17:04,222 --> 01:17:08,249
That's not true. I don't have a gun.
I don't believe in them.

905
01:17:09,260 --> 01:17:10,488
Bullshit.

906
01:17:13,999 --> 01:17:15,967
You stay and watch the kid.

907
01:17:17,035 --> 01:17:18,024
You all right?

908
01:17:18,470 --> 01:17:19,937
Ten-four.

909
01:17:36,388 --> 01:17:37,616
Come on.

910
01:17:40,058 --> 01:17:41,855
That must be Lutz's car.

911
01:17:45,363 --> 01:17:47,593
Hi, Jake. Have you seen Billy?

912
01:17:53,371 --> 01:17:55,066
Where's the stakeout?

913
01:17:56,641 --> 01:17:58,939
- Upstairs.
- Everybody, upstairs.

914
01:18:03,014 --> 01:18:04,072
Wait, Tony!

915
01:18:04,349 --> 01:18:05,316
Shit!

916
01:18:07,419 --> 01:18:09,387
Come on in. Close it.

917
01:18:10,088 --> 01:18:11,180
Shut up.

918
01:18:19,431 --> 01:18:22,662
Shut the door. Welcome to the party.

919
01:18:24,703 --> 01:18:26,261
Anybody else?

920
01:18:33,344 --> 01:18:34,902
That could be the station.

921
01:18:35,246 --> 01:18:37,976
Answer it and be careful what you say.

922
01:18:39,050 --> 01:18:41,109
Hi, it's Norman. Is Helen there?

923
01:18:41,386 --> 01:18:43,616
I want to tell her why I'm not home.

924
01:18:45,156 --> 01:18:47,386
I don't know.

925
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:52,018
10:00, 10:15.

926
01:18:52,664 --> 01:18:53,961
Excuse me?

927
01:18:54,165 --> 01:18:56,531
I said, "10:15."

928
01:19:00,305 --> 01:19:05,072
Some friend from that stupid rock group.
I said you wouldn't be home till after 10:00.

929
01:19:06,344 --> 01:19:09,040
He said they'd come by. Is that okay?

930
01:19:09,347 --> 01:19:12,316
Okay, everybody next door. Move it!

931
01:19:13,485 --> 01:19:16,010
10:00, 10:15...

932
01:19:29,768 --> 01:19:32,999
Breaker, this is Man from Uncle
with a distress call.

933
01:19:33,204 --> 01:19:35,069
- Do you read?
- Is this for real?

934
01:19:35,306 --> 01:19:38,332
This is an emergency. Call the police.

935
01:19:39,110 --> 01:19:42,011
Tell Captain Corbett you talked
to Norman Robberson.

936
01:19:42,213 --> 01:19:44,545
Tell him there's trouble at Osborn's.

937
01:19:44,783 --> 01:19:46,580
He's got my family hostage.

938
01:19:47,118 --> 01:19:49,416
I'm sure you don't want to hurt anyone.

939
01:19:49,621 --> 01:19:52,681
Save your breath. He's got to kill us.

940
01:19:53,124 --> 01:19:55,149
If we all put our heads together...

941
01:19:55,360 --> 01:19:58,158
He'll enjoy it because he's a killer.

942
01:19:58,296 --> 01:20:04,292
He can wear all the fancy suits he wants,
but inside he's just a street punk.

943
01:20:04,469 --> 01:20:07,063
Is this really the time to pick on him?

944
01:20:19,784 --> 01:20:21,376
Who is this one?

945
01:20:22,153 --> 01:20:25,054
That's just her boyfriend.

946
01:20:25,256 --> 01:20:27,520
Get down. No talking.

947
01:20:28,793 --> 01:20:32,593
Now I've got to whack an entire
middle-class suburban family.

948
01:20:32,797 --> 01:20:34,355
People will notice this.

949
01:21:13,271 --> 01:21:15,796
Where is your big one with the silencer?

950
01:21:16,674 --> 01:21:18,369
I thought you didn't have a gun.

951
01:21:18,843 --> 01:21:21,778
You need a gun these days,
to protect yourself.

952
01:21:22,614 --> 01:21:24,639
This was to be a friendly meeting.

953
01:21:25,116 --> 01:21:26,583
Then why'd you bring a gun?

954
01:21:27,318 --> 01:21:28,615
Yeah, that's right.

955
01:21:51,342 --> 01:21:52,400
What was that?

956
01:21:57,215 --> 01:21:58,512
Check it out.

957
01:21:59,584 --> 01:22:00,448
You check it out.

958
01:22:05,323 --> 01:22:07,416
Come on, this is ridiculous.

959
01:22:07,625 --> 01:22:10,617
We're acting like we don't trust each other.

960
01:22:13,731 --> 01:22:15,426
Let's leave the family.

961
01:22:15,667 --> 01:22:18,135
We'll go look together.

962
01:22:18,603 --> 01:22:19,627
Good idea.

963
01:22:20,672 --> 01:22:21,866
Come on, let's go.

964
01:22:56,407 --> 01:22:58,238
Little too far to the left.

965
01:23:01,312 --> 01:23:03,280
All right, let's just do this.

966
01:23:05,249 --> 01:23:06,682
Now, where is a good place?

967
01:23:12,323 --> 01:23:16,521
In the basement.
I got the walls lined with mattresses.

968
01:23:16,794 --> 01:23:18,227
They'll muffle the shots.

969
01:23:18,529 --> 01:23:19,757
You sure?

970
01:23:19,964 --> 01:23:22,524
Of course, I'm sure. I tried it myself.

971
01:23:25,670 --> 01:23:28,662
I was bored. I was just bored.

972
01:23:28,773 --> 01:23:32,436
I was waiting for him
and I was very bored waiting.

973
01:23:32,577 --> 01:23:33,805
All right, all right.

974
01:23:35,546 --> 01:23:37,514
All right, who goes first?

975
01:23:39,350 --> 01:23:40,544
The girl.

976
01:24:04,308 --> 01:24:05,275
Freeze!

977
01:24:08,780 --> 01:24:09,747
You drop it.

978
01:24:23,594 --> 01:24:25,585
You shot me again, you putz!

979
01:24:25,763 --> 01:24:27,424
I didn't, I shot him.

980
01:24:27,799 --> 01:24:30,359
Now you woke the whole neighborhood!

981
01:24:30,568 --> 01:24:32,763
- You should have watched him!
- I did!

982
01:24:32,937 --> 01:24:34,370
Then where is he?

983
01:24:47,051 --> 01:24:48,313
Norman?

984
01:24:54,792 --> 01:24:56,726
You drop it. Drop it.

985
01:24:57,528 --> 01:24:59,792
- Come on. Drop it.
- I'll shoot you.

986
01:25:00,031 --> 01:25:02,499
Drop it or I'll shoot Mommy and Daddy.

987
01:25:02,767 --> 01:25:07,033
Go ahead, drop it. Drop your gun
or you'll all go back to Buffalo.

988
01:25:07,438 --> 01:25:10,464
Buffalo, New York,
you said you were from?

989
01:25:11,542 --> 01:25:14,511
That's it. Very good.
Now you're being smart.

990
01:25:14,846 --> 01:25:18,338
Everything was perfect here.
You had to come late.

991
01:25:18,549 --> 01:25:19,481
You!

992
01:25:20,651 --> 01:25:21,640
Drop it!

993
01:25:32,630 --> 01:25:34,598
You don't know how to use that.

994
01:25:35,099 --> 01:25:36,930
Come on, Mommy, you shoot.

995
01:25:37,535 --> 01:25:39,526
Shoot it.

996
01:25:39,704 --> 01:25:41,365
Listen, dick.

997
01:25:41,606 --> 01:25:44,837
If I can make lobster-crab souffl
without having it fall...

998
01:25:44,942 --> 01:25:47,467
...I can sure as shit work this silly machine.

999
01:25:54,485 --> 01:25:58,854
Now drop the gun,
and don't make Mommy tell you twice.

1000
01:26:00,558 --> 01:26:03,584
I don't know what happened.
I had it planned.

1001
01:26:03,728 --> 01:26:04,990
She meant the gun.

1002
01:26:05,096 --> 01:26:06,654
It was all planned the right way.

1003
01:26:07,598 --> 01:26:09,065
I don't want to hurt anybody.

1004
01:26:09,901 --> 01:26:10,993
Give me that gun!

1005
01:26:12,637 --> 01:26:14,798
Jake, he's had enough!

1006
01:26:26,918 --> 01:26:28,442
You're okay, Helen.

1007
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:30,678
Want a cigarette?

1008
01:26:32,056 --> 01:26:33,489
Jake.

1009
01:26:34,058 --> 01:26:35,889
Don't push your luck.

1010
01:26:44,035 --> 01:26:45,696
Dad, are you okay?

1011
01:26:48,472 --> 01:26:49,496
Billy.

1012
01:26:50,875 --> 01:26:52,172
You've grown.

1013
01:26:56,614 --> 01:26:58,138
Kevin, have you been smoking?

1014
01:26:58,482 --> 01:27:00,916
Look what happened. I warned you.

1015
01:27:01,052 --> 01:27:02,815
Dad, that's Kevin.

1016
01:27:05,089 --> 01:27:06,056
Mother?

1017
01:27:08,226 --> 01:27:11,662
Don't worry. We'll get you to a hospital.

1018
01:27:11,829 --> 01:27:14,059
Yeah. Daddy, I love you.

1019
01:27:16,968 --> 01:27:18,196
We all love you.

1020
01:27:20,938 --> 01:27:21,870
Mom?

1021
01:27:24,008 --> 01:27:25,839
You've milked it enough.

1022
01:27:26,711 --> 01:27:28,042
This is the police.

1023
01:27:28,579 --> 01:27:30,069
Cool.

1024
01:27:30,514 --> 01:27:33,677
Release your hostages
and come out of the house.

1025
01:27:33,918 --> 01:27:36,614
This is Marva Prescott for Street Cops.

1026
01:27:36,854 --> 01:27:41,757
The well-manicured lawns of suburbia
were stricken with fear today.

1027
01:27:42,260 --> 01:27:45,229
Go. Get out. Go. Move.

1028
01:27:46,530 --> 01:27:48,157
Take it easy, would you?

1029
01:27:48,599 --> 01:27:51,830
- What happened?
- What happened is you're a moron!

1030
01:27:52,169 --> 01:27:54,933
Let's get a shot of the distraught family.

1031
01:27:55,273 --> 01:27:58,902
Excuse me, we have a deadline.
Wife, teenage daughter...

1032
01:27:59,610 --> 01:28:02,579
It's Street Cops. We're on Street Cops.

1033
01:28:16,861 --> 01:28:18,795
We're on Street Cops.

1034
01:28:22,300 --> 01:28:23,995
Smile, brother.

1035
01:28:25,036 --> 01:28:26,264
You first, Jake.

1036
01:28:28,172 --> 01:28:30,003
Now, smile.
