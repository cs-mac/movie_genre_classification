00:00:08,289 --> 00:00:09,773
<i>What is this?</i>

5
00:00:10,574 --> 00:00:11,773
- All right!
- Oh...

6
00:00:11,816 --> 00:00:12,722
<i>Hey!</i>

7
00:00:12,837 --> 00:00:13,651
- What?
- Hey!

8
00:00:13,702 --> 00:00:16,418
Don't touch that.
I'm giving it to Madame Shin.

9
00:00:16,451 --> 00:00:21,456
Geez, you give this measly
thing to your little sister.

10
00:00:21,517 --> 00:00:24,132
But, you sure are looking out
for the Director.

11
00:00:24,233 --> 00:00:25,722
What happened with the glass mask?

12
00:00:25,733 --> 00:00:27,298
I didn't bring it back.

13
00:00:27,319 --> 00:00:30,889
I didn't bring it back or
you couldn't bring it back?

14
00:00:31,587 --> 00:00:33,417
Someone else is going to bring it.

15
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:36,210
Don't worry.
That person will bring it for sure.

16
00:00:36,916 --> 00:00:37,825
That person?

17
00:00:37,926 --> 00:00:40,495
Did you meet a guy in Japan?

18
00:00:40,596 --> 00:00:43,591
Hey, aren't you going to school?
Go, so I can go to work too.

19
00:00:43,692 --> 00:00:45,002
Hurry, go.

20
00:00:48,492 --> 00:00:52,131
<i>Unni, the landlady called again.</i>

21
00:00:52,232 --> 00:00:53,905
Just pay her the rent, will you?

22
00:00:54,006 --> 00:00:56,554
All right. Go to school.

[Shim Gun Wook]

24
00:01:10,431 --> 00:01:12,558
Is it too early?

25
00:01:18,555 --> 00:01:19,480
Oh?

26
00:01:20,979 --> 00:01:23,818
Geez, what is this?

27
00:01:28,902 --> 00:01:30,570
Now what?

28
00:01:30,611 --> 00:01:31,350
[Shim Gun Wook]

29
00:01:31,423 --> 00:01:33,582
<i>I'm in Seoul.</i>

30
00:01:36,591 --> 00:01:38,397
<i>Welcome.</i>

31
00:01:38,622 --> 00:01:41,090
<i>Did Hong Tae Seong come with you?</i>

32
00:01:45,391 --> 00:01:46,691
<i>Welcome.</i>

33
00:01:48,063 --> 00:01:50,406
<i>Did you come alone?</i>

34
00:01:54,917 --> 00:01:56,334
<i>No. There are two of us.</i>

35
00:01:56,345 --> 00:02:00,407
What? So, Hong Tae Seong came too.

36
00:02:17,272 --> 00:02:18,225
Seon Young...

37
00:02:18,326 --> 00:02:21,202
I feel it was my fault
you fell in the water.

38
00:02:29,345 --> 00:02:31,418
Where shall I take you?

39
00:02:32,168 --> 00:02:34,198
We're going to the police station.

40
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:44,300
So, you're saying the glass mask is
now in Seoul, but it's not in your hand?

41
00:02:44,401 --> 00:02:45,794
Yes.

42
00:02:46,088 --> 00:02:50,759
There's someone who went and
got the glass mask before me,

43
00:02:50,912 --> 00:02:52,984
but it will be in Korea shortly.

44
00:02:53,085 --> 00:02:55,080
Someone got to it first?
Who is it?

45
00:02:55,111 --> 00:02:59,376
Well, that's...
I'm going to meet with him soon.

46
00:02:59,477 --> 00:03:02,014
And I'll make sure that there won't
be any impediment to the exhibit.

47
00:03:02,206 --> 00:03:03,805
But you said...

48
00:03:03,906 --> 00:03:07,771
that the glass mask made by Ryuu-sensei
is the only piece of its kind in the world.

49
00:03:07,902 --> 00:03:11,180
<i>And the reason I chose you
was to find a piece like that.</i>

50
00:03:11,281 --> 00:03:13,957
<i>And I trusted you had the skill
to acquire it.</i>

51
00:03:14,058 --> 00:03:16,229
You know I trust you, right?

52
00:03:17,222 --> 00:03:18,803
Of course.

53
00:03:18,933 --> 00:03:21,680
I will acquire it for your exhibit;
without fail.

54
00:03:33,926 --> 00:03:35,634
Aren't you coming?

55
00:03:35,669 --> 00:03:37,997
I'll wait for you here.

56
00:03:50,714 --> 00:03:51,850
<i>It's me.</i>

57
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:54,807
What's happening regarding what I requested?

58
00:03:55,527 --> 00:03:56,883
Yes.

59
00:03:57,128 --> 00:04:00,457
<i>- You can't park here, sir. Please move it.
- I'll contact you again later.</i>

60
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:03,704
You have Choi Seon Young's belongings
safely in custody, don't you?

61
00:04:03,725 --> 00:04:04,865
<i>Yes.</i>

62
00:04:07,934 --> 00:04:09,211
Detective Lee, bring some coffee.

63
00:04:09,312 --> 00:04:11,237
- Yes!
- Hurry, hurry.

64
00:04:13,652 --> 00:04:17,234
About Seon Young,
wasn't it a suicide?

65
00:04:17,335 --> 00:04:20,848
Yes, well...

66
00:04:20,983 --> 00:04:24,588
A new witness surfaced
on the day of her death.

67
00:04:25,787 --> 00:04:27,737
Who is this?

68
00:04:28,457 --> 00:04:30,132
My personal assistant.

69
00:04:31,116 --> 00:04:32,043
Ah... hello.

70
00:04:32,144 --> 00:04:33,222
A new witness?

71
00:04:33,323 --> 00:04:35,163
After analyzing the witness' statement,

72
00:04:35,264 --> 00:04:37,864
<i>we suspect the man whom Choi Seon
Young fought with outside your apartment</i>

73
00:04:37,895 --> 00:04:40,410
might possibly be the person
who was briefly adopted

74
00:04:40,431 --> 00:04:43,754
then given up for adoption
before you entered Haeshin Group.

75
00:04:43,855 --> 00:04:49,119
Seon Young knew the guy
who moved in instead of me?

76
00:04:49,491 --> 00:04:53,626
We've confirmed that they
both stayed at the same orphanage.

77
00:04:53,677 --> 00:04:57,446
Choi Seon Young never mentioned this to you?
About the other Hong Tae Seong?

78
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,852
Anyhow, we're wondering

79
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:04,155
if you might be able to find out

80
00:05:04,201 --> 00:05:09,768
<i>the real name or address of the boy
who was given up for adoption,</i>

81
00:05:09,769 --> 00:05:10,868
<i>or any sort of lead.</i>

82
00:05:10,969 --> 00:05:16,072
Is it really true that she met with him?

83
00:05:18,996 --> 00:05:24,935
She knew I was the son of the Haeshin Group
family and she never mentioned it to me.

84
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:31,135
My name... She did say she
liked my name Hong Tae Seong.

85
00:05:31,198 --> 00:05:34,130
She said it was a name she liked.

86
00:05:35,202 --> 00:05:36,545
<i>Tae Seong,</i>

87
00:05:36,767 --> 00:05:39,306
his name is Tae Seong too.

88
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:44,142
I haven't seen you in a long time.
What are you so busy with?

89
00:05:48,221 --> 00:05:49,265
Hey!

90
00:05:49,335 --> 00:05:50,950
Are you listening to me?

91
00:05:51,005 --> 00:05:53,572
Yeah.
Sorry, Noona.

92
00:05:53,802 --> 00:05:55,114
What is it?

93
00:05:55,187 --> 00:05:57,706
Haeshin Group document?

94
00:05:58,145 --> 00:05:59,478
Let's eat.

95
00:05:59,709 --> 00:06:02,438
It's been a long time since
I got to eat your cooking.

96
00:06:09,809 --> 00:06:10,827
Tae Seong...

97
00:06:10,868 --> 00:06:12,802
<i>Call me Gun Wook now.</i>

98
00:06:13,771 --> 00:06:15,811
It's him.

99
00:06:18,614 --> 00:06:20,893
The man I'm seeing...

100
00:06:24,185 --> 00:06:26,076
<i>Choi Seon Young?</i>

101
00:06:26,257 --> 00:06:27,725
<i>Yes.</i>

102
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:30,326
Oh!

103
00:06:30,347 --> 00:06:31,674
What are you doing here again?

104
00:06:31,705 --> 00:06:34,725
I heard you got probation.
Did you already get into trouble?

105
00:06:34,766 --> 00:06:36,619
<i>This is like your second home.</i>

106
00:06:36,674 --> 00:06:38,418
Keep up the good work.

107
00:06:40,421 --> 00:06:42,187
I'll be going now.

108
00:06:43,362 --> 00:06:46,380
Thank you for your cooperation.

109
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,911
Have you read Seon Young's diary?

110
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:51,372
Diary?

111
00:06:51,423 --> 00:06:52,808
Yes.

112
00:06:52,834 --> 00:06:55,133
Seon Young always carried around a diary.

113
00:06:55,184 --> 00:06:58,857
She carried it around like a wallet,
and was always writing things down.

114
00:06:59,058 --> 00:07:00,939
- Detective Lee,
- Yes?

115
00:07:01,047 --> 00:07:02,899
Was there a diary at Choi Seon Young's
house?

116
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,183
No.

117
00:07:04,419 --> 00:07:05,774
<i>It wasn't there?</i>

118
00:07:05,856 --> 00:07:07,659
That's strange.

119
00:07:07,922 --> 00:07:10,601
She was never without it.

120
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:14,698
If you need my help,
call me anytime.

121
00:07:23,992 --> 00:07:25,903
- What are you doing?!
- Eh?

122
00:07:31,387 --> 00:07:32,877
Tae Seong, what are you doing?

123
00:07:32,908 --> 00:07:34,217
Yes, Father.

124
00:07:34,306 --> 00:07:38,187
<i>Haven't you taken him away yet?</i>

125
00:07:39,391 --> 00:07:40,509
Tae Seong.

126
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:41,948
Yes?

127
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:44,844
Hong Tae Seong.

128
00:07:47,579 --> 00:07:51,381
Find out about the guy who
was called Hong Tae Seong.

129
00:07:53,717 --> 00:07:55,673
Why don't you answer?

130
00:07:55,678 --> 00:07:57,708
I understand.

131
00:07:59,267 --> 00:08:04,148
From what I remember,
he was bad news.

132
00:08:04,247 --> 00:08:07,371
<i>Seon Young was seeing him?</i>

133
00:08:07,655 --> 00:08:11,060
The reason she said she
liked the name Tae Seong,

134
00:08:11,287 --> 00:08:14,271
was it all because of that guy?

135
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:17,228
What the hell happened?

136
00:08:23,118 --> 00:08:25,041
Unni.

137
00:08:25,575 --> 00:08:27,940
Let me go to Japan.

138
00:08:28,031 --> 00:08:31,787
Gun Wook oppa doesn't even answer his phone.

139
00:08:31,963 --> 00:08:34,227
What if something happened?

140
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:37,106
Mo Ne, listen to me carefully.

141
00:08:37,127 --> 00:08:38,652
<i>If someone doesn't call very often,</i>

142
00:08:38,753 --> 00:08:41,416
and never tells you when
they're coming or going,

143
00:08:41,459 --> 00:08:43,727
that person doesn't have feelings for you.

144
00:08:43,828 --> 00:08:45,135
That person is using you.

145
00:08:45,236 --> 00:08:49,115
I like him and that's enough.
What does all that matter?

146
00:08:49,347 --> 00:08:50,327
Mo Ne...

147
00:08:50,368 --> 00:08:51,615
<i>Have you tried on some clothes?</i>

148
00:08:51,716 --> 00:08:53,499
She's bringing some right out.

149
00:08:53,555 --> 00:08:55,531
She's coming now.

150
00:09:01,371 --> 00:09:02,972
What's that?

151
00:09:02,993 --> 00:09:04,444
That's not our style.

152
00:09:04,505 --> 00:09:06,713
It's a new brand.

153
00:09:06,752 --> 00:09:10,161
<i>It's a promotional gift for our VVIP's.</i>

154
00:09:10,192 --> 00:09:11,762
<i>You don't like it?</i>

155
00:09:11,886 --> 00:09:13,458
It doesn't look too good.

156
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:15,367
Customers like you
probably wouldn't shop for it.

157
00:09:15,468 --> 00:09:16,842
<i>It's also in a different price range.</i>

158
00:09:16,943 --> 00:09:19,463
<i>I was pondering
whether or not to bring it out...</i>

159
00:09:19,564 --> 00:09:23,128
Still the design is new and fresh.

160
00:09:23,445 --> 00:09:24,728
I'll just take it out.

161
00:09:24,829 --> 00:09:27,700
No, put it in a separate bag.

162
00:09:27,982 --> 00:09:29,537
Why do you want it,
if you aren't even going to wear it?

163

And I don't like it when it gets loud.

325
00:21:43,655 --> 00:21:46,758
Yes, I completely understand.

326
00:21:46,982 --> 00:21:48,853
<i>She's so high strung.</i>

327
00:21:48,954 --> 00:21:51,507
All right, then go.

328
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:54,812
Don't let Tae Seong know we met.

329
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:00,471
<i>What's the matter with you?</i>

330
00:22:00,572 --> 00:22:02,915
<i>Why do you let people like that in our home?</i>

331
00:22:02,992 --> 00:22:06,237
<i>Can't you tell from the way he seduced
an innocent girl and made trouble?</i>

332
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:09,704
A paltry good-for-nothing who
doesn't even know the basics.

333
00:22:12,204 --> 00:22:16,821
Whether he's a good-for-nothing or not,
we'll just have to wait and see.

334
00:22:20,592 --> 00:22:22,630
Where's Hong Tae Seong?

335
00:22:23,906 --> 00:22:24,853
He didn't come.

336
00:22:24,954 --> 00:22:25,731
What is this?

337
00:22:25,862 --> 00:22:28,897
Weren't you coming with Hong Tae Seong?

338
00:22:31,426 --> 00:22:35,100
<i>Jae In, where are you?</i>

339
00:22:35,381 --> 00:22:37,274
I've got to go.

340
00:25:18,395 --> 00:25:22,875
<i>Young Master,
do you still want to go home?</i>

341
00:25:22,976 --> 00:25:23,902
Yes.

342
00:25:24,003 --> 00:25:28,705
Don't tell Madame Shin,
because she'll say you'll get cavities.

343
00:25:29,006 --> 00:25:30,046
<i>Okay.</i>

344
00:25:30,968 --> 00:25:32,835
What is it?

345
00:25:38,939 --> 00:25:40,183
Does it taste good?

346
00:25:40,284 --> 00:25:41,368
Yes.

347
00:25:43,712 --> 00:25:45,808
It tastes good.

348
00:25:58,639 --> 00:26:01,001
<i>How did you...</i>

349
00:26:01,445 --> 00:26:02,680
I'm sorry.

350
00:26:02,698 --> 00:26:05,429
I noticed the box.

351
00:26:09,135 --> 00:26:10,763
<i>Excuse me...</i>

352
00:26:15,447 --> 00:26:18,027
No, it's nothing.

353
00:26:23,019 --> 00:26:26,364
I heard there was a child
who briefly lived here.

354
00:26:27,011 --> 00:26:30,431
<i>Hong Tae Seong has asked me to find him.</i>

355
00:26:30,782 --> 00:26:32,892
Who should I ask?

356
00:26:35,422 --> 00:26:38,515
Why is the Young Master looking for him?

357
00:26:42,004 --> 00:26:43,793
I'm not sure.

358
00:26:44,526 --> 00:26:46,785
Do you know anything, by any chance?

359
00:26:47,853 --> 00:26:49,681
I don't know.

360
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,895
I see.

361
00:26:54,135 --> 00:26:55,998
All right, then...

362
00:27:05,244 --> 00:27:07,547
What do you think of that man?

363
00:27:07,681 --> 00:27:09,693
I don't really know.

364
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:13,555
Are there so few men in the world,
that she has to pick such a low-life?

365
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:15,780
<i>But, he's not a low-life.</i>

366
00:27:15,886 --> 00:27:17,945
I'm saying all sorts of things to you.

367
00:27:18,105 --> 00:27:21,663
Anyhow, you're still working
on the glass mask, right?

368
00:27:21,764 --> 00:27:23,242
Ah, of course.

369
00:27:23,343 --> 00:27:25,197
Then, I'll be going.

370
00:27:30,043 --> 00:27:33,653
So, who on earth is the person
who has the glass mask?

371
00:27:37,011 --> 00:27:39,267
What am I going to do about the glass mask?

372
00:27:39,315 --> 00:27:41,375
I'm going crazy.

373
00:27:43,755 --> 00:27:46,364
Oh... You haven't left yet?

374
00:27:48,953 --> 00:27:50,070
No.

375
00:27:50,547 --> 00:27:52,390
You left a while ago.

376
00:27:52,701 --> 00:27:54,137
Were you waiting for me?

377
00:27:54,667 --> 00:27:56,044
What about transportation?

378
00:27:56,145 --> 00:27:59,082
I came with the Director from the gallery.

379
00:27:59,493 --> 00:28:00,566
<i>Hop on.</i>

380
00:28:02,348 --> 00:28:05,304
<i>Hey. You expect me to ride this thing?</i>

381
00:28:05,388 --> 00:28:07,579
<i>Never mind, I'll just go.</i>

382
00:28:08,257 --> 00:28:09,238
Get on.

383
00:28:09,339 --> 00:28:12,953
How can I ride that?
I'm wearing a skirt.

384
00:28:16,892 --> 00:28:18,894
It's okay if I ride?

385
00:28:26,521 --> 00:28:29,048
It'll be cold. Put this on.

386
00:28:29,813 --> 00:28:31,059
<i>Just a second.</i>

387
00:28:40,262 --> 00:28:42,805
<i>Hold on tight.
Or you might fall.</i>

388
00:28:51,123 --> 00:28:53,025
Just a second. Stop the car!

389
00:28:57,201 --> 00:28:58,551
Oppa!

390
00:28:59,815 --> 00:29:02,300
I'm sure that's Gun Wook oppa's motorcycle.

391
00:29:04,601 --> 00:29:08,701
<i>{\a6}Forget the hurt you got from love.</i>

392
00:29:08,702 --> 00:29:11,902
<i>{\a6}I hope that all of your tears dry now,</i>

393
00:29:11,925 --> 00:29:16,702
<i>{\a6}basking in the sun after the rain.</i>

394
00:29:16,803 --> 00:29:20,703
<i>{\a6}Even though I try not to love you,</i>

395
00:29:20,904 --> 00:29:24,204
<i>{\a6}My heart keeps on racing so fast like this...</i>

396
00:29:27,628 --> 00:29:30,237
But why did you go there earlier?

397
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:33,331
You're on tea-drinking
terms with the Chairman?

398
00:29:33,453 --> 00:29:35,535
It's because of Mo Ne, I guess.

399
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:38,680
Ahh... Mo Ne.

400
00:29:40,105 --> 00:29:42,053
That house is pretty nice, huh?

401
00:29:42,851 --> 00:29:43,988
Yeah.

402
00:29:44,451 --> 00:29:46,477
<i>The first time I saw that house,</i>

403
00:29:46,578 --> 00:29:48,727
<i>I really thought I was going to faint.</i>

404
00:29:49,065 --> 00:29:52,328
Wow, I thought, there are really
houses like that in the world.

405
00:29:52,379 --> 00:29:55,302
There are really people who
live in houses like this.

406
00:29:55,387 --> 00:29:57,000
I thought it would just be nice,

407
00:29:57,034 --> 00:30:00,500
to have a 33 pyeong* apartment.
(*unit of measuring area)

408
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:03,324
But there is a completely different world.

409
00:30:03,394 --> 00:30:05,205
A different world... whatever!

410
00:30:05,306 --> 00:30:07,534
Hey, is your house better?

411
00:30:07,565 --> 00:30:09,057
That's right.

412
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:12,231
Now you're even making up stuff.

413
00:30:14,751 --> 00:30:17,504
Thanks for pretending
not to know me earlier.

414
00:30:18,657 --> 00:30:21,053
It's the same for me, anyhow.

415
00:30:22,236 --> 00:30:24,627
What are we doing?

416
00:30:25,292 --> 00:30:27,460
<i>It's really funny.</i>

417
00:30:29,434 --> 00:30:31,270
Hong Tae Seong is here.

418
00:30:31,759 --> 00:30:34,731
Yeah, I heard earlier.

419
00:30:35,973 --> 00:30:39,710
Well, you want me to arrange a meeting?

420
00:30:42,736 --> 00:30:46,061
Frankly speaking,
Hong Tae Seong isn't the issue.

421
00:30:46,609 --> 00:30:49,073
<i>The glass mask,
that's the issue.</i>

422
00:30:49,149 --> 00:30:52,241
I kind of talked a big game to the Director.

423
00:30:52,272 --> 00:30:56,480
I told her I'd get it for her without
fail and show it at the gallery opening.

424
00:30:57,063 --> 00:30:58,907
Meet him and ask him.

425
00:30:58,993 --> 00:31:00,390
Who knows?

426
00:31:00,457 --> 00:31:05,217
No. If I ask him, he'll want
to tease me with it even more.

427
00:31:05,245 --> 00:31:08,176
He says his goal is to irritate his mother.

428
00:31:08,197 --> 00:31:10,368
Would you give it to me
if you were him?

429
00:31:12,686 --> 00:31:17,192
I guess you know
Hong Tae Seong better than me.

430
00:31:20,524 --> 00:31:22,314
Is that true?

431
00:31:24,826 --> 00:31:30,394
Really. Now that I think about it,
I don't know anything about you.

432
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:32,952
Tell me about you.

433
00:31:37,854 --> 00:31:39,107
Me?

434
00:31:42,878 --> 00:31:44,798
What are you curious about?

435
00:31:46,158 --> 00:31:47,935
Let's see.

436
00:31:52,719 --> 00:31:55,136
What your parents do,

437
00:31:55,492 --> 00:31:57,821
<i>what you like,</i>

438
00:31:58,475 --> 00:32:00,722
what your dream is,

439
00:32:05,097 --> 00:32:07,837
what kind of person you are...

440
00:32:15,595 --> 00:32:17,855
Are you really curious?

441
00:32:21,785 --> 00:32:23,725
Are you really curious?

442
00:32:24,614 --> 00:32:27,626
Just focus on your target.
Hong Tae Seong.

443
00:32:27,677 --> 00:32:30,049
Do you always have to talk like...

444
00:32:30,774 --> 00:32:32,086
I'm going.

445
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,433
What about the glass mask?

446
00:32:47,306 --> 00:32:49,118
I told you I needed it.

447
00:32:50,858 --> 00:32:52,066
I'm going.

448
00:33:06,261 --> 00:33:08,034
My dream...

449
00:33:25,397 --> 00:33:27,999
Who told you
you could report that I came back?

450
00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:29,753
I'm sorry.

451
00:33:30,564 --> 00:33:32,912
I'm not liking you these days.

452
00:33:39,425 --> 00:33:40,923
I don't have a pass.

453
00:33:40,934 --> 00:33:42,835
You've come, sir?

454
00:33:44,717 --> 00:33:47,640
Why don't you block me like last time?

455
00:33:47,741 --> 00:33:49,203
Please go on in.

456
00:33:49,271 --> 00:33:51,090
So, you know who I am now?

457
00:33:51,108 --> 00:33:54,031
I'm sorry about last time.

458
00:34:06,698 --> 00:34:09,549
<i>Tae Seong, sit over there.</i>

459
00:34:17,337 --> 00:34:19,502
- When did you come?
- A few days ago.

460
00:34:19,603 --> 00:34:22,399
You should have called and let us know.

461
00:34:23,156 --> 00:34:25,891
It's not like you care whether
I come or go. Why bother?

462
00:34:25,992 --> 00:34:28,815
So twisted as always...

463
00:34:29,284 --> 00:34:32,026
Tae Seong, starting tomorrow,
come work at Haeshin Construction.

464
00:34:32,087 --> 00:34:35,702
Haeshin has embarked on
building a robot theme park.

465
00:34:35,803 --> 00:34:37,725
You take it and run it.

466
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:39,822
You liked robots.

467
00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:43,970
I liked playing with them...

468
00:34:43,991 --> 00:34:45,186
What did you say?

469
00:34:45,287 --> 00:34:46,700
You're placing a business in his hands?

470
00:34:46,801 --> 00:34:49,195
What does he know how to do
that would make you bring him in?

471
00:34:49,296 --> 00:34:52,810
To this age, all the kid knows
how to do is sleep and play.

472
00:34:52,911 --> 00:34:54,931
<i>Oh, that's right,
he occasionally gets into trouble.</i>

473
00:34:55,032 --> 00:34:57,940
What kind of humiliation are you asking
for by bringing him into the business?!

474
00:34:58,041 --> 00:34:59,188
Mom...

475
00:34:59,707 --> 00:35:02,450
I'm against it.
What does he know?

476
00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:05,467
You sent him to study in the States
and Japan, but did he study?

477
00:35:05,468 --> 00:35:08,467
Did he even live like a person?

478
00:35:10,985 --> 00:35:13,432
What are you doing over there?

479
00:35:14,398 --> 00:35:16,473
<i>Is this a place you should be?</i>

480
00:35:17,203 --> 00:35:18,892
My apologies.

481
00:35:18,983 --> 00:35:21,153
I told him to come.
Why?

482
00:35:21,254 --> 00:35:24,421
This is an important conversation.
Who is he to be here?

483
00:35:24,475 --> 00:35:26,258
Step outside.

484
00:35:52,621 --> 00:35:54,653
You said my dad was coming to get me.

485
00:35:54,754 --> 00:35:56,997
Mom!

486
00:35:58,794 --> 00:36:02,021
<i>Why are you so persistent?!
You're just a kid!</i>

487
00:36:04,014 --> 00:36:08,472
Soon, your mom and dad
are going to pick you up.

488
00:36:13,114 --> 00:36:14,447
Excuse me.

489
00:36:17,919 --> 00:36:20,116
I have something to ask.

490
00:36:20,812 --> 00:36:24,134
Remember the teachings of
philosopher Dasan, Jeong Yak Yong.

491
00:36:24,145 --> 00:36:25,731
If you don't have a solid foundation,

492
00:36:25,832 --> 00:36:29,032
before the paint on the building dries,
the cornerstone will collapse.

493
00:36:29,092 --> 00:36:30,587
You recklessly put a kid who
knows nothing in that position,

494
00:36:30,588 --> 00:36:32,988
and how are you going to clean up
the mess later?

495
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:34,215
You do the things you want.

496
00:36:34,316 --> 00:36:36,339
And don't concern yourself over the company.

497
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:39,877
No, I'll start tomorrow.

498
00:36:39,997 --> 00:36:43,031
I was slowly starting to
get sick of playing around.

499
00:36:43,132 --> 00:36:44,419
I'll just come and play in the company.

500
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:46,179
Are you in your right mind?

501
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,678
Do you want me to be in my right mind?

502
00:36:47,779 --> 00:36:48,723
What?

503
00:36:48,824 --> 00:36:51,369
You like it
when I live like I'm out of my mind.

504
00:36:51,470 --> 00:36:52,343
<i>Who knows?</i>

505
00:36:52,444 --> 00:36:54,855
Maybe I'll create some major disaster,

506
00:36:55,561 --> 00:36:57,009
and ruin Haeshin Construction.

507
00:36:57,110 --> 00:36:58,329
Unbelievable.

508
00:36:58,430 --> 00:36:59,531
Are you really going
to keep acting like this?

509
00:36:59,552 --> 00:37:00,643
<i>That's enough.</i>

510
00:37:00,744 --> 00:37:03,017
Tae Ra, you take over the department store.

511
00:37:03,028 --> 00:37:05,395
And Tae Seong, you take over Construction.

512
00:37:05,423 --> 00:37:07,004
I can go now, right?

513
00:37:13,503 --> 00:37:15,837
Information on the child
given up for adoption?

514
00:37:16,789 --> 00:37:18,520
Why, all of a sudden?

515
00:37:18,610 --> 00:37:21,395
Hong Tae Seong has asked me to look into it.

516
00:37:23,201 --> 00:37:24,771
I don't know
if there are any documents left,

517
00:37:24,872 --> 00:37:27,228
but I'll contact you if I find anything.

518
00:37:27,552 --> 00:37:29,201
Thank you.

519
00:37:32,659 --> 00:37:34,772
What's the matter?

520
00:37:34,873 --> 00:37:37,501
You said your name was Shim Gun Wook?

521
00:37:38,572 --> 00:37:39,851
Yes.

522
00:37:39,947 --> 00:37:45,164
There wasn't a lot of information
on Shim Gun Wook's childhood either.

523
00:37:45,866 --> 00:37:48,120
The job of a personal assistant,

524
00:37:48,133 --> 00:37:51,459
requires having no qualms about
digging into people's backgrounds.

525
00:37:52,073 --> 00:37:53,867
It sounds like it came naturally;

526
00:37:53,968 --> 00:37:55,674
that question...

527
00:37:56,021 --> 00:37:59,902
Because you are seeing Mo Ne,
so of course...

528
00:38:03,179 --> 00:38:05,384
What are you curious about?

529
00:38:11,382 --> 00:38:13,222
- Where are you going?
- You don't need to go.

530
00:38:13,323 --> 00:38:15,158
Car key.

531
00:40:11,632 --> 00:40:12,966
<i>Hello.</i>

532
00:40:15,975 --> 00:40:17,891
<i>I'm pressing the lobby.</i>

533
00:41:57,339 --> 00:41:59,594
<i>Hey, hey, what is this?</i>

534
00:42:00,052 --> 00:42:02,400
Madame Shin gave it to me as a gift.

535
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:03,900
You've never gotten a gift?

536
00:42:03,941 --> 00:42:05,447
Hey, you have to remove the price tag.

537
00:42:05,548 --> 00:42:07,224
<i>Hey, don't.</i>

538
00:42:07,312 --> 00:42:08,522
<i>What is this?</i>

539
00:42:08,585 --> 00:42:13,728
You're not going to pretend this is brand
new and try to get a refund, are you?

540
00:42:13,775 --> 00:42:15,826
Hey, what are you talking about?

541
00:42:15,927 --> 00:42:17,476
She gave it to me.

542
00:42:17,577 --> 00:42:19,577
I'm joking.

543
00:42:21,237 --> 00:42:23,663
<i>Ah, girl, it must be nice.</i>

544
00:42:24,341 --> 00:42:28,210
Hey, but were you able to
get the glass mask?

545
00:42:41,510 --> 00:42:42,502
<i>Yeah.</i>

546
00:42:42,526 --> 00:42:48,286
It's me.
You know what I told you the other day?

547
00:42:48,325 --> 00:42:50,219
About the glass mask?

548
00:42:50,298 --> 00:42:52,857
Did you talk to Hong Tae Seong?

549
00:42:52,950 --> 00:42:54,782
<i>Hong Tae Seong is at Haeshin right now.</i>

550
00:42:54,883 --> 00:42:56,855
Huh? Really?

551
00:42:56,956 --> 00:42:58,945
Hey, I'll call you back.

552
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:01,905
<i>What are you doing?
Are you going somewhere?</i>

553
00:43:01,976 --> 00:43:05,034
<i>Yeah. The person who has the
glass mask is at Haeshin right now.</i>

554
00:43:05,035 --> 00:43:06,548
I'm going to try to see him.

555
00:43:09,639 --> 00:43:11,921
I'm on my way up.

556
00:43:11,997 --> 00:43:14,172
Where can I see him?

557
00:43:14,238 --> 00:43:16,167
<i>He just left.</i>

558
00:43:16,204 --> 00:43:18,686
<i>Come up the escalator for now.</i>

559
00:43:18,787 --> 00:43:20,987
I don't see you.

560
00:43:21,101 --> 00:43:23,498
<i>Yeah, behind you.</i>

561
00:43:23,577 --> 00:43:25,644
- Behind me?
- No, to your right.

562
00:43:25,678 --> 00:43:27,266
Yeah, here.

563
00:43:27,583 --> 00:43:29,064
Hey, Gun Wook.

564
00:43:36,912 --> 00:43:38,646
If you haven't eaten yet,
let's go eat.

565
00:43:38,747 --> 00:43:40,095
Huh?

566
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:43,732
Then is he waiting for us?

567
00:43:43,934 --> 00:43:44,846
Hmm?

568
00:43:44,847 --> 00:43:48,851
You should have just told me where
and I could have gone there.

569
00:43:49,232 --> 00:43:52,061
So, do I look okay?

570
00:43:55,725 --> 00:43:56,952
Yeah.

571
00:43:57,191 --> 00:44:01,075
But, Hong Tae Seong just left.

572
00:44:01,218 --> 00:44:02,297
Hey.

573
00:44:02,398 --> 00:44:05,189
He just charged out, so what was
I supposed to do? What do I say?

574
00:44:05,290 --> 00:44:06,631
Should I have told him to wait?

575
00:44:06,732 --> 00:44:09,203
Are you playing games with me right now?

576
00:44:09,852 --> 00:44:10,907
I told you, didn't I?

577
00:44:11,018 --> 00:44:13,500
That I needed the glass mask.
That I had to get it.

578
00:44:13,518 --> 00:44:15,429
I asked you to help me meet him.

579
00:44:15,530 --> 00:44:17,952
<i>And you're playing games with me?</i>

580
00:44:17,969 --> 00:44:21,022
I told you multiple times I needed it!

581
00:44:21,071 --> 00:44:24,014
If it was so important,
why did you leave Japan without it?

582
00:44:24,069 --> 00:44:29,765
If it was that urgent, you should
have taken it, stolen it, or whatever.

583
00:44:29,838 --> 00:44:33,947
Are you asking me why I left it there
because you really don't know?

584
00:44:33,968 --> 00:44:35,340
Why?

585
00:44:35,735 --> 00:44:38,723
<i>So that Hong Tae Seong
would bring it back to Korea...</i>

586
00:44:38,951 --> 00:44:44,322
I mean, back directly to you?

587
00:44:44,403 --> 00:44:45,822
Is that what you hoped for?

588
00:44:45,923 --> 00:44:47,333
That's right.

589
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:49,725
That's what I hoped.

590
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:52,819
So you're saying that you know all this
and you're still playing games with me.

591
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:56,343
I don't have much time before the
exhibit, Madame Shin is waiting,

592
00:44:56,444 --> 00:44:59,241
and it's a headache even without this.

593
00:44:59,832 --> 00:45:01,630
Never mind, then.

594
00:45:01,731 --> 00:45:04,147
Never mind.
What can I even say to you?

595
00:45:04,169 --> 00:45:06,727
<i>You know my situation and you're
always playing these games!</i>

596
00:45:06,791 --> 00:45:09,641
All right. I'll get it.
I'll go and get it myself!

597
00:45:09,717 --> 00:45:12,141
I don't need your help.

598
00:45:33,652 --> 00:45:35,724
I'm going to have to return you.

599
00:45:56,818 --> 00:45:58,109
What now?

600
00:45:58,442 --> 00:46:01,245
Yeah, let me drive you.

601
00:46:01,345 --> 00:46:03,084
Forget it.

602
00:46:03,419 --> 00:46:04,792
Come to the parking lot.

603
00:46:04,854 --> 00:46:06,264
I don't want to!

604
00:46:06,423 --> 00:46:08,040
I'll wait.

605
00:46:24,369 --> 00:46:27,935
That Shim Gun Wook, where is he?

606
00:46:30,372 --> 00:46:32,748
That Shim Gun Wook, really.

607
00:46:34,314 --> 00:46:36,007
<i>Excuse me.</i>

608
00:46:39,683 --> 00:46:42,263
Oh, Tae Seong.

609
00:46:42,830 --> 00:46:44,194
What are you doing here?

610
00:46:44,695 --> 00:46:46,195
Well...

611
00:46:46,681 --> 00:46:49,189
I was supposed to meet someone.

612
00:46:51,624 --> 00:46:54,035
So, you came to Seoul.

613
00:46:54,036 --> 00:46:55,927
Yes, well...

614
00:46:58,712 --> 00:47:01,104
Have you been well?

615
00:47:01,449 --> 00:47:02,878
Yes.

616
00:47:19,182 --> 00:47:23,667
You brought the glass mask with you,
didn't you?

617
00:47:23,915 --> 00:47:25,643
No.

618
00:47:26,154 --> 00:47:28,771
You didn't bring it with you?

619
00:47:28,990 --> 00:47:31,216
I don't have it with me.

620
00:47:32,853 --> 00:47:34,700
Please don't joke.

621
00:47:34,785 --> 00:47:37,222
You brought it from Japan, didn't you?

622
00:47:38,026 --> 00:47:39,598
Didn't you tell me to rebel

623
00:47:39,699 --> 00:47:41,705
<i>in front of that person?</i>

624
00:47:42,010 --> 00:47:44,625
I did leave that note,

625
00:47:44,726 --> 00:47:46,586
but I'm kind of in an urgent bind.

626
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:48,709
I'm really sorry,

627
00:47:48,742 --> 00:47:52,690
but can't you just sell it to me?

628
00:47:52,911 --> 00:47:54,621
But I don't want to.

629
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:58,108
I haven't even had a chance to rebel.

630
00:47:58,412 --> 00:47:59,955
I haven't had a chance to think of
how to play with it,

631
00:47:59,956 --> 00:48:01,555
and you want me to hand it over already?

632
00:48:01,556 --> 00:48:06,488
But, an art piece isn't even a toy,
so how could you play with it?

633
00:48:06,589 --> 00:48:09,342
But to me,
it's not that different from a toy.

634
00:48:09,439 --> 00:48:12,032
Please don't talk like that.

635
00:48:15,757 --> 00:48:20,917
And, rebelling for no reason
isn't necessarily a good thing.

636
00:48:21,018 --> 00:48:25,652
If you are good to the person,
that person might be moved.

637
00:48:25,684 --> 00:48:28,397
And that means you win, doesn't it?

638
00:48:28,498 --> 00:48:30,658
Moved.

639
00:48:30,885 --> 00:48:34,580
I don't think that person is someone
who would feel moved by anything I do.

640
00:48:37,854 --> 00:48:39,726
I'm curious about something.

641
00:48:40,798 --> 00:48:42,489
What is it?

642
00:48:43,786 --> 00:48:46,186
Why did you just leave it?

643
00:48:47,295 --> 00:48:48,848
<i>You said you needed the glass mask,</i>

644
00:48:48,949 --> 00:48:51,740
and you seemed so desperate in the snow.

645
00:48:53,169 --> 00:48:57,067
Could it be that you hoped
I would bring it to you?

646
00:48:57,168 --> 00:48:58,552
<i>No,</i>

647
00:48:59,076 --> 00:49:02,147
I just wanted to buy it in a proper manner.

648
00:49:02,187 --> 00:49:04,253
How much do you want for it?

649
00:49:04,394 --> 00:49:06,519
The current market...

650
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:08,836
I don't need money.

651
00:49:10,780 --> 00:49:16,626
Then, shall we go on a date?

652
00:49:17,830 --> 00:49:19,079
Excuse me?

653
00:49:21,313 --> 00:49:22,749
It was a joke.

654
00:49:29,106 --> 00:49:30,497
Well,

655
00:49:30,936 --> 00:49:34,475
if you change your mind or
your rebellion ends, call me.

656
00:49:37,257 --> 00:49:38,500
Excuse me.

657
00:49:43,704 --> 00:49:45,412
I'll deliver it shortly.

658
00:49:48,452 --> 00:49:49,881
Really?

659
00:49:52,082 --> 00:49:54,309
It's a promise, right?

660
00:49:54,982 --> 00:49:57,602
Then, I'll be waiting.

661
00:49:58,189 --> 00:49:59,195
Thank you.

662
00:49:59,295 --> 00:50:00,777
Thank you so much.

663
00:50:09,593 --> 00:50:12,912
Young Master is moving in,
so send some people over.

664
00:50:13,013 --> 00:50:14,210
Ah, yes.

665
00:50:14,997 --> 00:50:18,469
Manager ahjumma,
Tae Seong oppa is back?

666
00:50:18,485 --> 00:50:19,919
Ah, yes.

667
00:50:19,938 --> 00:50:22,355
Then you should have told me earlier!

668
00:50:22,399 --> 00:50:24,855
Gun Wook oppa probably
came back with him.

669
00:50:24,927 --> 00:50:27,086
Agassi!

670
00:50:41,479 --> 00:50:43,008
<i>[Life-saving Rope]</i>

671
00:50:50,451 --> 00:50:52,505
I knew he'd do this.

672
00:50:53,501 --> 00:50:56,064
Is there something wrong with his phone?

673
00:50:58,250 --> 00:50:59,960
It looks like it's been worn.

674
00:51:00,061 --> 00:51:03,858
I just tried it on at home.

675
00:51:03,959 --> 00:51:06,010
Everyone does that.

676
00:51:06,092 --> 00:51:10,593
I tried it on and it didn't really
seem to suit me and the size was off.

677
00:51:11,407 --> 00:51:13,884
Wait just a moment.

678
00:51:28,276 --> 00:51:33,300
We'll refund it, but next time,
you must bring a receipt.

679
00:51:33,401 --> 00:51:35,035
Ah, yes.

680
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:38,078
<i>But that outfit...</i>

681
00:51:38,287 --> 00:51:43,616
It was part of a new collection that
was given as a promotion to VVIPs,

682
00:51:43,618 --> 00:51:48,659
but you're saying another
employee truly sold it to you, yes?

683
00:51:49,111 --> 00:51:52,510
It was a promotional
collection given out to VVIP's?

684
00:51:52,588 --> 00:51:55,181
No, I bought it.

685
00:51:57,285 --> 00:51:58,950
Then, have a good day.

686
00:52:06,625 --> 00:52:08,677
Hey, one for me too.

687
00:52:12,137 --> 00:52:14,894
<i>Give me some money then.</i>

688
00:52:22,931 --> 00:52:26,430
I guess you got a little money today.

689
00:52:26,483 --> 00:52:31,979
It looks that way.
I got a little money today.

690
00:52:34,372 --> 00:52:35,949
<i>I'm going.</i>

691
00:52:36,044 --> 00:52:37,069
Hey kid.

692
00:52:43,488 --> 00:52:45,045
You can have this.

693
00:52:45,586 --> 00:52:47,119
Hey!

694
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:50,120
No way...

695
00:52:51,119 --> 00:52:54,086
What, you don't like it?

696
00:52:54,715 --> 00:53:00,680
It seems you guys have the same taste.

697
00:53:06,789 --> 00:53:08,462
Where did you get this?

698
00:53:08,464 --> 00:53:10,673
What do you want to know for?

699
00:53:13,755 --> 00:53:15,031
Ahjussi.

700
00:53:15,610 --> 00:53:16,543
Huh?

701
00:53:16,810 --> 00:53:19,271
Do you have a girlfriend?

702
00:53:19,364 --> 00:53:20,913
<i>Do you make good money?</i>

703
00:53:21,014 --> 00:53:25,221
Ah, that's right,
you're unemployed.

704
00:53:25,621 --> 00:53:29,031
Still, do you happen to have a house?

705
00:53:29,042 --> 00:53:31,462
Why are you asking all of a sudden?

706
00:53:31,563 --> 00:53:36,877
See, I just had a really good idea.

707
00:53:39,245 --> 00:53:44,765
Why are there so many
people curious about me?

708
00:53:48,975 --> 00:53:50,234
<i>I'm going now.</i>

709
00:53:50,235 --> 00:53:51,063
You are?

710
00:53:51,164 --> 00:53:51,968
See you later.

711
00:53:52,069 --> 00:53:53,610
Okay.

712
00:53:58,719 --> 00:54:01,461
He looked kinda like he's got some.

713
00:54:05,238 --> 00:54:07,352
<i>You have a message.</i>

714
00:54:10,955 --> 00:54:12,513
<i>I met with Hong Tae Seong.</i>

715
00:54:12,542 --> 00:54:14,551
<i>He says he'll give me the glass mask.</i>

716
00:54:14,633 --> 00:54:19,368
<i>But if you play games with me again,
you're dead!</i>

717
00:54:56,855 --> 00:54:58,361
<i>Oh, yes.</i>

718
00:54:58,442 --> 00:54:59,741
<i>A package came for the director.</i>

719
00:54:59,842 --> 00:55:01,924
<i>Ah, thank you.</i>

720
00:55:03,177 --> 00:55:04,687
<i>Mmm, come in.</i>

721
00:55:14,673 --> 00:55:15,770
Director.

722
00:55:17,871 --> 00:55:21,270
Someone has sent a gift.

723
00:55:21,287 --> 00:55:23,632
Yeah?
Leave it and go.

724
00:55:24,446 --> 00:55:25,727
<i>Jae In,</i>

725
00:55:26,568 --> 00:55:28,443
how's the glass mask going?

726
00:55:30,340 --> 00:55:32,788
You'll be able to see it shortly.

727
00:55:33,019 --> 00:55:34,918
Open it.

728
00:55:36,298 --> 00:55:37,906
Is this it?

729
00:55:38,203 --> 00:55:39,243
Yes.

730
00:55:39,542 --> 00:55:40,880
You look at it on your own.

731
00:55:40,981 --> 00:55:42,904
I'll be outside.

732
00:55:43,368 --> 00:55:45,007
All right.

733
00:56:03,366 --> 00:56:05,339
Don't you need to go into the office?

734
00:56:05,621 --> 00:56:08,632
If I go in now,
it will just be time to leave work.

735
00:56:08,688 --> 00:56:12,729
It must be nice for you, since you
don't have specific office hours.

736
00:56:13,857 --> 00:56:16,817
I wonder if she has opened it by now.

737
00:56:25,946 --> 00:56:26,787
Did you call me?

738
00:56:26,888 --> 00:56:28,860
Did you see it?

739
00:56:30,623 --> 00:56:32,778
What is this?!

740
00:56:34,795 --> 00:56:37,863
Were these all that were in there?

741
00:56:37,964 --> 00:56:43,206
Was the person who took the glass mask him?

742
00:56:44,444 --> 00:56:45,195
Yes.

743
00:56:45,216 --> 00:56:49,362
You lose the glass mask to someone like him.
Is that all you measure up to, Moon Jae In?!

744
00:56:49,723 --> 00:56:51,429
You amateur!

745
00:56:51,540 --> 00:56:55,277
You lose a piece to a guy who
doesn't even know how to look at art?!

746
00:56:55,378 --> 00:56:57,820
<i>What the hell kind of work is this?!</i>

747
00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:02,255
<i>Please control your temper at work.</i>

748
00:57:05,628 --> 00:57:08,279
It's possible that someone else
could buy it first.

749
00:57:08,380 --> 00:57:10,053
But is it any reason to get so angry?

750
00:57:10,154 --> 00:57:11,870
A high-bred person like you...

751
00:57:12,315 --> 00:57:16,171
You, did you do this
on purpose to annoy me?

752
00:57:16,238 --> 00:57:18,425
You're bored, aren't you?

753
00:57:18,484 --> 00:57:20,410
It was fun, wasn't it?

754
00:57:22,258 --> 00:57:24,513
<i>It's not something for you to play with.
Hand it over.</i>

755
00:57:26,086 --> 00:57:28,484
Shall I give it to her or not?

756
00:57:28,585 --> 00:57:30,490
<i>What should I do?</i>

757
00:57:31,588 --> 00:57:35,720
You dare... you dare...

758
00:57:36,329 --> 00:57:37,678
It's mine.

759
00:57:37,779 --> 00:57:40,049
I can do what I want with it, right?

760
00:57:40,344 --> 00:57:43,487
Yours?
How can there be anything that's yours?

761
00:57:43,579 --> 00:57:46,011
<i>Was there anything that was yours
from the start?</i>

762
00:57:46,112 --> 00:57:48,814
Whatever you lay your hands on,
things, women, you ruin them.

763
00:57:48,835 --> 00:57:51,435
You break them, and ultimately lose them!

764
00:57:51,471 --> 00:57:55,379
Do you have anyone left beside you?

765
00:57:58,024 --> 00:58:00,092
<i>And you say it's yours?!</i>

766
00:58:00,103 --> 00:58:01,854
Do you want to destroy that too?

767
00:58:01,955 --> 00:58:05,232
Go ahead and break it!

768
00:58:07,653 --> 00:58:09,865
I was just going to.

769
00:58:13,826 --> 00:58:18,832
I'm the one who breaks whatever
I lay my hands on, things, women...

770
00:58:18,859 --> 00:58:21,515
This measly little mask?

771
00:58:21,533 --> 00:58:24,128
I'll break it for you.

772
00:58:32,855 --> 00:58:37,072
The glass mask you wanted,
I leave it here for you.

773
00:58:41,708 --> 00:58:44,118
That was a piece that Ryuu-sensei created.

774
00:58:44,138 --> 00:58:46,656
It's not a piece
which should be so casually broken.

775
00:58:46,744 --> 00:58:48,844
<i>I don't know how great
you think you are,</i>

776
00:58:48,845 --> 00:58:52,026
<i>but that's not something
you can treat so carelessly!</i>

777
00:58:52,202 --> 00:58:54,860
<i>How could you break it so easily?!</i>

778
00:58:55,022 --> 00:58:57,589
Do you know what you just did?!

779
00:59:02,004 --> 00:59:03,866
Miss Moon Jae In.

780
00:59:06,379 --> 00:59:08,058
You impertinent thing.

781
00:59:08,506 --> 00:59:09,940
How dare you overstep your bounds
and interfere?

782
00:59:10,041 --> 00:59:12,786
Is this a place for you to step in?

783
00:59:12,954 --> 00:59:14,852
There are lines that people
are not to cross.

784
00:59:14,953 --> 00:59:17,518
Lines that fit your position.

785
00:59:18,024 --> 00:59:21,496
How dare a thing like you...
try to slap my son's face?

786
00:59:21,597 --> 00:59:25,107
A thing like you...
and in front of my eyes!

787
00:59:26,078 --> 00:59:27,334
<i>That old glass mask.</i>

788
00:59:27,435 --> 00:59:28,845
He can break 10 like it.

789
00:59:28,946 --> 00:59:31,377
If we need to, we can just
pay money and buy another one.

790
00:59:31,408 --> 00:59:35,976
But over something like this,
you dare to belittle my son?!

791
00:59:36,066 --> 00:59:38,383
What the hell
do you think you are?!

792
00:59:44,410 --> 00:59:46,057
Get out of my office immediately.

793
01:00:16,671 --> 01:00:17,805
<i>Jae In.</i>

794
01:00:18,620 --> 01:00:19,628
Let go.

795
01:00:19,729 --> 01:00:21,660
I want to be alone.

796
01:00:35,079 --> 01:00:37,030
I'm touched.

797
01:00:38,522 --> 01:00:42,469
Why, all of a sudden,
are you acting like a mother?

798
01:00:42,695 --> 01:00:44,426
After all these years...

799
01:00:49,566 --> 01:00:53,047
What you just said right now...

800
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:56,043
Did you mean it?

801
01:00:57,028 --> 01:00:59,583
I'm saying this, just in case.

802
01:01:00,025 --> 01:01:02,008
Make no mistake.

803
01:01:02,042 --> 01:01:05,459
I didn't do it to play mother
to you after all these years.

804
01:01:05,463 --> 01:01:09,836
I just wanted to make that girl realize,

805
01:01:09,874 --> 01:01:14,810
not to take Haeshin Group
or me so lightly.

806
01:01:14,829 --> 01:01:15,730
<i>And another thing,</i>

807
01:01:15,831 --> 01:01:20,561
I just can't tolerate those who
overstep the bounds of their position.

808
01:01:20,708 --> 01:01:21,972
<i>Do you get it?</i>

809
01:01:22,073 --> 01:01:24,979
So, stop humiliating our Haeshin.

810
01:01:25,056 --> 01:01:26,984
<i>It's embarrassing.</i>

811
01:01:31,904 --> 01:01:39,876
You should have just not said anything.

812
01:01:41,925 --> 01:01:45,838
"Ah, she really is my mother."

813
01:01:46,078 --> 01:01:51,099
"Inside, she really does love me
just a little bit."

814
01:01:52,613 --> 01:01:54,871
I almost mistakenly thought those things.

815
01:01:56,786 --> 01:01:58,629
I was almost grateful.

816
01:02:07,149 --> 01:02:09,029
Clean up in here.

817
01:02:44,961 --> 01:02:46,940
You...

818
01:02:56,879 --> 01:02:57,672
I...

819
01:03:00,973 --> 01:03:03,472
I'll be Hong Tae Seong.

820
01:03:04,228 --> 01:03:07,135
<i>I'm Hong Tae Seong right now,</i>

821
01:03:07,702 --> 01:03:09,930
so get angry with me.

822
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:15,086
Get angry with me just like
the first time you met me.

823
01:03:16,196 --> 01:03:22,195
You won't be able to say anything
to the real Hong Tae Seong anyway.

824
01:03:27,612 --> 01:03:29,275
Do it.

825
01:03:41,733 --> 01:03:44,105
Hong Tae Seong.

826
01:03:45,428 --> 01:03:51,386
You... do you think I gave
up the glass mask for this?

827
01:03:52,486 --> 01:03:57,041
This is the first time since I started
this work that I've ever let a piece go.

828
01:03:57,150 --> 01:03:58,696
I did it for you.

829
01:03:58,797 --> 01:04:01,098
I did it so that you'd come back.

830
01:04:02,607 --> 01:04:08,126
If you came back,
I wanted to get close to you somehow.

831
01:04:09,640 --> 01:04:12,074
<i>But, what is this?</i>

832
01:04:12,166 --> 01:04:14,385
The mask is broken.

833
01:04:14,757 --> 01:04:17,719
And Madame Shin's goodwill
towards me is broken.

834
01:04:25,732 --> 01:04:31,025
I've learned once again what happens
when I mess with guys like you.

835
01:04:31,266 --> 01:04:35,166
<i>{\a6}Someday... suddenly,</i>

836
01:04:35,266 --> 01:04:38,066
<i>{\a6}even if your thoughts should fall on me,</i>

837
01:04:38,100 --> 01:04:44,066
<i>{\a6}I pray you don't sadly cry</i>

838
01:04:45,459 --> 01:04:48,899
<i>{\a6}Some far away day...</i>

839
01:04:48,910 --> 01:04:52,310
<i>{\a6}Some far away day,</i>

840
01:04:52,411 --> 01:04:55,911
<i>{\a6}I pray we don't meet again...</i>

841
01:04:56,012 --> 01:04:59,512
<i>{\a6}I pray we don't meet again.</i>

842
01:04:59,613 --> 01:05:03,090
<i>{\a6}Someday, the two of us...</i>

843
01:05:03,114 --> 01:05:06,514
<i>{\a6}Someday, the two of us,</i>

844
01:05:06,515 --> 01:05:10,115
<i>{\a6}whatever chance may bring,</i>

845
01:05:10,116 --> 01:05:16,116
<i>{\a6}I pray we don't meet again.</i>

846
01:05:20,417 --> 01:05:24,717
<i>{\a6}I pray.</i>

847
01:05:28,818 --> 01:05:34,818
<i>{\a6}This, I confess to you.</i>

<i>{\a6}I'm always near, wandering near your side.</i>

854
01:05:57,625 --> 01:06:03,125
<i>{\a6}Because my thorn causes you such pain,</i>

855
01:06:03,226 --> 01:06:06,226
<i>{\a6}I try my best to hide away the tears...</i>

856
01:06:06,248 --> 01:06:08,078
<i>Who the hell are you?</i>

857
01:06:08,133 --> 01:06:09,711
Are you the Shim Gun Wook I know?

858
01:06:09,812 --> 01:06:10,880
<i>What's your relationship?</i>

859
01:06:10,981 --> 01:06:13,959
If you lie, you're dead.
Tell me the truth!

860
01:06:14,061 --> 01:06:16,871
<i>The child who was adopted
into Chairman Hong's house</i>

861
01:06:16,890 --> 01:06:18,666
<i>and then put up for adoption.</i>

862
01:06:18,966 --> 01:06:22,314
Whatever the reason,
I won't fall for you.

863
01:06:22,415 --> 01:06:24,000
<i>What if I were to get close to you?</i>

864
01:06:24,101 --> 01:06:25,389
I won't let you be.

865
01:06:25,490 --> 01:06:27,806
<i>That place really makes a person
feel strange.</i>

866
01:06:27,822 --> 01:06:31,853
<i>Being angry, being happy or sad,</i>

867
01:06:31,911 --> 01:06:34,600
<i>feelings I like and don't like,</i>

868
01:06:34,701 --> 01:06:36,430
all become meaningless.

869
01:06:36,581 --> 01:06:38,409
What's the use of being good to me?

870
01:06:38,510 --> 01:06:40,473
<i>I may see you for a while like this,</i>

871
01:06:40,574 --> 01:06:42,800
<i>and then I'll throw you away.</i>
