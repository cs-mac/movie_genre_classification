1
00:00:52,187 --> 00:00:52,912
Rach!

2
00:00:54,225 --> 00:00:55,032
Rach...

3
00:01:34,956 --> 00:01:36,956
Good morning!

4
00:01:40,814 --> 00:01:42,914
Surprise!

5
00:01:43,331 --> 00:01:45,731
Breakfast in bed.

6
00:01:47,047 --> 00:01:50,914
Oh, how sweet... the mango
cut into little hearts!

7
00:01:50,949 --> 00:01:55,624
Yup. And the moon apples and
the smiley face.  Bacon smiley face.

8
00:01:58,248 --> 00:02:00,438
I'm not coming to Niagara Falls.

9
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:07,395
Not funny cause... you know how
hard it was to get a jacuzzi room?

10
00:02:07,415 --> 00:02:08,867
You know you have to
book that way in advance

11
00:02:08,868 --> 00:02:11,400
and they don't give a
refund on the jacuzzi room.

12
00:02:12,248 --> 00:02:17,214
Listen I'm... Jordan, I'm going
through something and...

13
00:02:17,396 --> 00:02:21,497
I think that I need to...
that we need...

14
00:02:21,515 --> 00:02:25,532
Okay, hold on.
Wait!  Just wait.

15
00:02:28,449 --> 00:02:32,127
No! Hey hey hey!
What are you doing?

16
00:02:32,162 --> 00:02:36,315
Okay. This stuff is suppose to
happen till tomorrow night...

17
00:02:37,092 --> 00:02:39,930
- So I'm jumping the gun here.
- No! Maybe no...

18
00:02:40,049 --> 00:02:43,916
You... are the only girl that
I ever wanted to be with.

19
00:02:44,208 --> 00:02:49,209
Rachel Stern, will you marry me?

20
00:02:52,067 --> 00:02:55,304
I can't spend the rest of my life

21
00:02:56,138 --> 00:02:59,167
having sex with just you.

22
00:03:00,835 --> 00:03:03,234
We're breaking up!

23
00:03:04,709 --> 00:03:08,584
Okay, okay.  So, Rach ...

24
00:03:08,835 --> 00:03:12,025
Okay love, I can get better!

25
00:03:12,334 --> 00:03:14,279
What? I can!  I can get better.

26
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,841
You just... you just tell me
what it is I'm doing wrong.

27
00:03:17,876 --> 00:03:20,945
- I don't think that's a very good idea.
- I can take it okay! Come on.

28
00:03:21,001 --> 00:03:23,001
Yeah?

29
00:03:23,835 --> 00:03:25,735
All right.

30
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:32,298
- You have bad breath.
- Yeah, I can fix that.

31
00:03:32,318 --> 00:03:36,300
You're sloppy kisser.  You've no
idea what to do with my breasts.

32
00:03:36,421 --> 00:03:40,524
Sometimes I think you're actually trying
to feed but you come way too fast.

33
00:03:40,543 --> 00:03:43,221
- Your penis is just so ...
- Okay, I'm good, thanks.

34
00:03:43,222 --> 00:03:44,354
- So you don't have to.
- ...to the side and then

35
00:03:44,355 --> 00:03:48,213
you never go down on me.
You refer to sex as gentle time.

36
00:03:48,248 --> 00:03:51,426
You are terrified of going
anywhere near my asshole.

37
00:03:51,427 --> 00:03:53,834
- You won't consider a threesome.
- Why would I want to have a threesome!

38
00:03:53,869 --> 00:03:56,137
Why, so I can disappoint
two people at the same time?

39
00:03:56,437 --> 00:03:58,730
Well, it's a good point.

40
00:03:58,735 --> 00:04:04,167
Okay, look, Rach.  We can fix
this, right.  We can fix this thing.

41
00:04:04,168 --> 00:04:07,522
I can read a book.
No, I ... we can make some list.

42
00:04:07,557 --> 00:04:10,991
We can fix this thing
together as a team.

43
00:04:11,026 --> 00:04:15,653
Okay, but there are so much
that I haven't experienced.

44
00:04:15,837 --> 00:04:20,852
And being with you this past year,
I just... I need to get out there.

45
00:04:21,837 --> 00:04:26,103
We both do.  We tried.
We really tried.

46
00:04:26,703 --> 00:04:30,313
So I need to move on and...

47
00:04:31,507 --> 00:04:34,718
- Hey I'm setting you free.
- But I don't want to be free.

48
00:04:34,838 --> 00:04:37,795
- I wanna be with you.
- No, no! Just don't, don't.

49
00:04:37,796 --> 00:04:40,384
No! No!
Take your week off.

50
00:04:40,804 --> 00:04:45,866
Oh, go to Toronto, stay with
Dandak, have fun.  Right?

51
00:04:45,902 --> 00:04:48,953
When you get back, I'll move in
with my sister and we can...

52
00:04:48,954 --> 00:04:52,579
Okay, woah. No!
Just hold on. Please.

53
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:57,976
Okay, alright.  You made
your point, okay, I hear you.

54
00:04:58,097 --> 00:05:00,884
- I'm a crappy lover, okay?
- Yup.

55
00:05:01,019 --> 00:05:03,802
Alright, but look...
I checked this in.

56
00:05:03,922 --> 00:05:08,943
I got you the window seat which
you love, okay.  I'm in the aisle.

57
00:05:08,978 --> 00:05:12,463
And you know, let's just go
and talk about it on vacation.

58
00:05:23,556 --> 00:05:25,755
Gary's totally overworked.

59
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,160
And you better get to it chop, chop

60
00:05:29,161 --> 00:05:31,720
since you're decking out early
for that lame-ass trip of yours.

61
00:05:31,729 --> 00:05:35,386
- Yeah I know, Kelly, we...
- What you gonna cry?

62
00:05:35,507 --> 00:05:38,928
- Need a tissue?
- No, I don't.

63
00:05:39,048 --> 00:05:42,906
My God, you are crying.
You are actually...

64
00:05:57,541 --> 00:05:59,972
- Hey Mom.
- Are you out of your mind?

65
00:06:00,092 --> 00:06:05,012
- You waited years for her like a schmuck.
- What did she say to you? That's not...

66
00:06:05,133 --> 00:06:06,138
<i>You think she can do better? </i>

67
00:06:06,139 --> 00:06:09,105
You should be proposing to that
woman, not breaking up with her.

68
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:12,613
Woah.  What...?  No one's breaking
up with any one, Mom.  Okay.

69
00:06:12,633 --> 00:06:15,764
In fact, we're meeting at
the airport in like three hours

70
00:06:15,765 --> 00:06:18,217
for a very special trip to a very...

71
00:06:18,252 --> 00:06:20,837
I can't talk now.
I'm working out.

72
00:06:25,559 --> 00:06:30,913
<i>This is the final boarding
call for Flight 632 to Toronto.</i>

73
00:06:31,247 --> 00:06:34,750
<i>All passengers must now get on board.</i>

74
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:46,513
<i>... paging Toronto
passenger Jordan Abrams.</i>

75
00:06:46,926 --> 00:06:50,400
<i>Jordan Abrams,
please report to the gate.</i>

76
00:06:51,101 --> 00:06:53,401
I'm waiting for someone.

77
00:06:53,843 --> 00:06:56,043
<i>She's not coming.</i>

78
00:07:08,027 --> 00:07:11,190
- What is it, Jordan?
- Hey, are you through security yet?

79
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:14,150
- No, I'm not coming.
- Come on, you better hurry up honey.

80
00:07:14,152 --> 00:07:16,882
- They're closing the gates here.
- No. I am not coming okay.

81
00:07:16,883 --> 00:07:18,839
We need some space right now.

82
00:07:20,095 --> 00:07:22,244
Okay, you know what?
I'm coming right home

83
00:07:22,245 --> 00:07:24,017
and we'll just reschedule
the flight for tomorrow.

84
00:07:24,052 --> 00:07:27,615
No, no, no!  You're
not listening, Jordan.

85
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:31,585
I need this, I do.
I'll see you in a week.

86
00:07:36,845 --> 00:07:39,624
You strike me as a kind of...
Hello!

87
00:07:41,396 --> 00:07:45,391
<i>You strike me as a kind of
guy people need a break from.</i>

88
00:07:45,512 --> 00:07:47,911
<i>You're smothering her.</i>

89
00:07:48,429 --> 00:07:50,828
<i>Get on the plane.</i>

90
00:08:19,555 --> 00:08:22,612
There he is.
Come here.

91
00:08:23,788 --> 00:08:26,320
The next seven days
you observe my every move,

92
00:08:26,321 --> 00:08:28,875
study my every gesture and
stay close to exactly as I say.

93
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:31,352
Watch, listen, be a sponge.

94
00:08:31,373 --> 00:08:34,521
Life is a buffet, my friend.   You
probably said that like a million times.

95
00:08:34,522 --> 00:08:37,549
- I don't think so.
- Now, it's time for you
to eat off the buffet.

96
00:08:37,584 --> 00:08:41,060
Now what's to consider if you agreed.
Shaved? I'm guessing not!

97
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,722
- That's alright, I have enough to...
- I'm sorry, man.

98
00:08:43,723 --> 00:08:47,130
I have no intention of being
unfaithful to Rachel, okay.

99
00:08:47,134 --> 00:08:49,528
Unfaithful?
She dumped you, dude.

100
00:08:49,548 --> 00:08:52,555
Oh, that's very nice.  That's
very compassionate and sensitive.

101
00:08:52,556 --> 00:08:54,261
No, stop!  That's not fair!

102
00:08:54,348 --> 00:08:57,203
I've watched you pine for this
girl since you were 12 years old.

103
00:08:57,223 --> 00:09:00,479
It took you 24 years to
convince her to give you a shot.

104
00:09:00,599 --> 00:09:03,120
You took that shot.  It didn't
work out.  I'm sorry about that.

105
00:09:03,121 --> 00:09:04,709
But it's time for you to move on.

106
00:09:04,815 --> 00:09:08,361
And as your sexual mentor,
I need you to stay focused.

107
00:09:08,382 --> 00:09:11,740
Excuse me.  I'm sorry to bother you.
First of all, beautiful boots!

108
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:14,263
Can I ask you a question?
Is that alright?

109
00:09:14,724 --> 00:09:19,632
My friend here, do we...?
Do you find him attractive?

110
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:23,948
Yeah, he's not bad, maybe a seven.

111
00:09:25,024 --> 00:09:27,212
- 7 out of 20?
- No.

112
00:09:27,346 --> 00:09:29,772
- Is that out of 10?  Wow!
- Yeah, dude.

113
00:09:29,858 --> 00:09:32,263
I was gonna say 5 or 6,
but you're in great shape.

114
00:09:32,283 --> 00:09:34,750
- A 7 out of 10, for sure, right?
- 7.

115
00:09:34,751 --> 00:09:35,856
- For sure?
- Yes!

116
00:09:35,891 --> 00:09:39,413
Listen!  We're throwing him a little
shindig tonight.  He's new in town.

117
00:09:39,533 --> 00:09:42,278
Why don't you, your beautiful boots,
some of your friends?  Come on by.

118
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:45,800
Eightish, Apartment 4.
What do you say?

119
00:09:46,933 --> 00:09:49,380
- Sure.
- Yes.  Fantastic!

120
00:09:51,151 --> 00:09:53,611
See, a little sexual
confidence goes a long way.

121
00:09:53,612 --> 00:09:55,620
- It's not genetics.  It's not tricks.
- Trust me on this man, okay.

122
00:09:55,622 --> 00:09:57,371
I know Rachel better
than she knows herself.

123
00:09:57,491 --> 00:09:59,217
By tonight she will have called me,

124
00:09:59,218 --> 00:10:01,977
by tomorrow she'll be
on a plane here, alright.

125
00:10:03,717 --> 00:10:05,218
There's still a chance, brother,

126
00:10:05,219 --> 00:10:07,919
to take those shriveled little
raisins you call testicles

127
00:10:07,954 --> 00:10:10,634
and put them back where they
belong inside your scrotum,

128
00:10:10,635 --> 00:10:13,070
which, I reiterate
must be clearly shorten.

129
00:10:13,105 --> 00:10:15,755
It's common courtesy.
Ladies expect it.

130
00:10:27,552 --> 00:10:30,015
Oh, easy easy!

131
00:10:30,236 --> 00:10:33,448
The less you struggle,
the less it will pinch.

132
00:10:34,935 --> 00:10:36,935
Hey, wait wait wait!

133
00:10:38,852 --> 00:10:40,933
No! No ...

134
00:10:41,735 --> 00:10:43,818
No, no, no!

135
00:10:44,017 --> 00:10:47,043
Oh God!  Be gentle, please!

136
00:10:48,811 --> 00:10:51,845
Thank you Renaldo.
Appreciate that. This is for you.

137
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:56,060
- Oh, for the love of God!  Wait for me.
- Very well.

138
00:10:59,653 --> 00:11:01,733
Squeeze!

139
00:11:02,054 --> 00:11:04,811
- What the fuck you doing right here?
- I know, I know!

140
00:11:04,812 --> 00:11:06,040
- Look look look look!
- I'm...

141
00:11:06,045 --> 00:11:08,306
I know! I just have a question
first.  I have a question.

142
00:11:08,307 --> 00:11:11,412
What is the deal with half-naked
dude serving drinks?

143
00:11:11,413 --> 00:11:12,540
Right right.
Yes, no...

144
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:15,067
He is here to make
sure that you get laid.

145
00:11:15,187 --> 00:11:19,692
Yes, women are all wrapped up thinking
about some sexual nature and what not!

146
00:11:19,812 --> 00:11:22,660
I don't understand how... why
don't they just have sex with him?

147
00:11:22,661 --> 00:11:25,000
- He's very good looking.
- Herein lies the genius of my plans.

148
00:11:25,002 --> 00:11:28,371
See, that gentleman enjoys the
company of other gay gentlemen.

149
00:11:28,554 --> 00:11:32,609
Alright, so women
will have no choice but...

150
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:35,972
- Give me the phone, please.
- No, enough, enough! Listen. No.

151
00:11:36,138 --> 00:11:38,534
Not until you talk
to one of these girls.

152
00:11:38,554 --> 00:11:42,568
Alright, that's all I'm asking.
For me. Baby stuff, talk okay. Listen.

153
00:11:42,688 --> 00:11:46,751
I know you're nervous,
but you're a solid 7.

154
00:11:46,886 --> 00:11:50,180
- You're a solid 7.
- Alright, alright.

155
00:11:50,315 --> 00:11:53,161
Well so...  if you
could please direct me

156
00:11:53,319 --> 00:11:58,025
to a lady with whom you're not
having of course, I will talk to her.

157
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:00,614
Rush up.
Not these two.

158
00:12:00,789 --> 00:12:03,188
No, I've been inside that.

159
00:12:04,147 --> 00:12:08,153
- There!  Does bomb sex count?
- No, that's fine.

160
00:12:08,288 --> 00:12:09,770
- Okay, then the brunette.
- Okay.

161
00:12:09,771 --> 00:12:11,483

162
00:12:26,298 --> 00:12:28,653

00:12:47,857 --> 00:12:51,382

00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:57,623
- Job. What do you do for work?

172
00:12:57,624 --> 00:12:59,830
Oh yeah?

00:13:13,566 --> 00:13:16,778
I just... I really...
I miss my girlfriend a lot.

178
00:13:17,319 --> 00:13:19,324
- Excuse me.
- Oh oh.

179
00:13:23,484 --> 00:13:26,600
There, I talked, okay.
Made an ass of myself with it.

180
00:13:26,626 --> 00:13:29,995
Hey dude. Where are you going?
What's with the costume?

181
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:34,197
Yeah, to ward off another one of
this strange marriage candidates.

182
00:13:34,317 --> 00:13:36,460
Oh my God, your parents
are still setting you up.

183
00:13:36,461 --> 00:13:39,359
Yes, very helpful in Hindu family GTA.

184
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:43,523
Sorry I got to step outside.
You are in charge whilst I'm gone.

185
00:13:43,642 --> 00:13:45,398
Oh, I just need to grab my
phone of you for freedom.

186
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:46,646
You grab what now?

187
00:13:47,526 --> 00:13:49,004
- Grab my phone.
- Is that what you want?

188
00:13:49,005 --> 00:13:51,142
Let me check something here.
Let me see.

189
00:13:52,151 --> 00:13:55,784
- As I suspected.  Zero missed calls.
- Okay.

190
00:13:55,785 --> 00:13:58,300
Why the hell would
she call you, dude?

191
00:13:58,317 --> 00:14:00,069
Because ...

192
00:14:02,011 --> 00:14:06,004
Because she is jealous.
No, no, because she is jealous.

193
00:14:06,005 --> 00:14:09,080
Do you remember last year I
went to that convention in Calgary

194
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:11,754
and I posted that photo with that girl
with a red head and chain all around me,

195
00:14:11,755 --> 00:14:14,806
and Rachel got like weird and jealous and
she called me like 15 times that night.

196
00:14:14,852 --> 00:14:15,952
Do you remember that?
You remember that?

197
00:14:15,953 --> 00:14:18,305
No, why the hell
would I remember that?

198
00:14:18,306 --> 00:14:21,357
- God sake!  Give me the phone.
- Well, take it!

199
00:14:21,358 --> 00:14:23,924
- I'm trying...
- Why do I keep pointers. Exact same thing.

200
00:14:23,925 --> 00:14:25,554
Hey, I don't think
this is a funny game!

201
00:14:25,653 --> 00:14:28,094
- It's there. It's in the ceiling with God.
- It is?

202
00:14:28,652 --> 00:14:30,852
That's funny!
You're very funny.

203
00:14:41,137 --> 00:14:42,469
- Jordan.
- What?

204
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:46,338
Jordan, I think it's best
if we do not speak.

205
00:14:46,373 --> 00:14:51,996
What? What honey, I can't hear you, man.
Dandak thrown this crazy party for me...

206
00:14:52,031 --> 00:14:55,903
and it's hopping man, it's hopping.
And there's all these girls here...

207
00:14:56,487 --> 00:15:01,812
Ah there's this one girl Tanya. She's
in real estate and she's all over my...

208
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:08,080
Hey Rach ... Is that a gentle time
playlist playing there. Are you...?

209
00:15:09,029 --> 00:15:11,229
<i>Are you with someone?</i>

210
00:15:11,488 --> 00:15:15,691
Look, I think we just wait
to talk until you get back.

211
00:15:16,113 --> 00:15:18,083
- Okay?
- Great. Yeah, okay good.

212
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:22,351
Okay that's a good idea.  Is there
somebody there in there with you?

213
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,470
You.. You're so bad.
Get down.

214
00:15:26,388 --> 00:15:28,389
Hello?

215
00:15:28,779 --> 00:15:30,780
Rach?

216
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:52,220
- Hello!
- Hi.

217
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,369
I was a bit weird before
and I'm sorry for that.

218
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:56,916
So now what?
You're cured?

219
00:15:56,923 --> 00:16:01,150
Well, I'm feeling a lot
better than I was then.

220
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:05,140
So hoping we could maybe
start over you and I.

221
00:16:05,948 --> 00:16:09,837
- Ah.  Okay.
- Okay.

222
00:16:09,872 --> 00:16:13,815
Thank you.
I'm Jordan. I'm an accountant.

223
00:16:13,907 --> 00:16:18,611
- Tanya, real estate.
- Pleasure to meet you.

224
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:23,644
Tanya real estate.
Can I ask you a personal question?

225
00:16:25,432 --> 00:16:27,433
Okay.

226
00:16:27,566 --> 00:16:29,686
Could we take some
sexy photos together

227
00:16:29,687 --> 00:16:32,392
so I can convince my
girlfriend to marry me?

228
00:16:36,224 --> 00:16:39,194
Put your arm around me like this,
and I'm gonna take a photo.

229
00:16:39,229 --> 00:16:40,733
Didi take quick photo!

"Beauty & the Beast"
GENTLEMEN'S CLUB

231
00:17:20,534 --> 00:17:22,534
Excuse me!

232
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:29,985
Excuse me. Pardon me.
I'm sorry. I couldn't help...

233
00:17:30,106 --> 00:17:34,168
These machines ...
the fees are astronomical.

234
00:17:35,577 --> 00:17:37,166
I want chips.

235
00:17:37,285 --> 00:17:39,726
Yeah, but they charge you a
fee here, a big one and then

236
00:17:39,727 --> 00:17:43,840
your bank charges is like hidden double
fee and it's just like not reasonable.

237
00:17:43,842 --> 00:17:47,101
Yeah, look man, when
a lady wants chips.

238
00:17:48,094 --> 00:17:49,294
Here!

239
00:17:49,869 --> 00:17:52,460
It's like a withdrawal
from the "Bank of Karma".

240
00:17:52,961 --> 00:17:54,388
You keep it.

241
00:17:54,661 --> 00:17:59,952
Oh no, seriously!  Here you just
like pay it for or whatever.

242
00:18:02,911 --> 00:18:04,911
Thanks.

243
00:18:09,416 --> 00:18:13,101
Spike, I need the lock-cutters.

244
00:18:13,221 --> 00:18:16,517
For fucks sake Julia, try
writing the combination down!

245
00:18:16,537 --> 00:18:20,985
I did. I wrote it on a gum wrapper
and I put it in my purse.

246
00:18:21,329 --> 00:18:23,406
But then I left that purse at home.

247
00:18:33,162 --> 00:18:37,180
- Three drink minimum.
- Right. Yes.

248
00:18:39,496 --> 00:18:43,377
- Don't give me the mean eye!
- Last time!

249
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:46,296
It'll never happen again.

250
00:18:49,872 --> 00:18:53,287
See I think that's good one,
but I think we can do a better one.

251
00:18:53,788 --> 00:18:56,585
Who's up?
Your turn, baby!

252
00:18:56,705 --> 00:18:59,377
One.  Here's one for you.
We'll do a double shall we?

253
00:18:59,497 --> 00:19:05,157
Here we go. Here's your twenty.
One, two, three...  Ahh!

254
00:19:06,205 --> 00:19:09,215
You gonna eat that sandwich, Jules?

255
00:19:13,164 --> 00:19:16,242
You guys still like to drink or what?

256
00:19:16,581 --> 00:19:21,590
Oh wow, that is a very attractive one.
- Hey, handsome!

257
00:19:21,998 --> 00:19:26,675
That's the chicken man. You got
extra.  Extras, extras all around!

258
00:19:26,873 --> 00:19:29,436
Would you like to do
one more with daddy?

259
00:19:29,437 --> 00:19:32,430
You wanna dry hump?
I'm with...

260
00:19:38,165 --> 00:19:40,564
I hate my job.

261
00:19:42,858 --> 00:19:44,857
Oh please shut up.

262
00:19:56,707 --> 00:19:59,108
I want my pants.

263
00:20:01,025 --> 00:20:03,125
I want my pants...

264
00:20:09,292 --> 00:20:11,291
Help...

265
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:16,991
Oh fuck you stupid "Karma Bank".

266
00:20:18,667 --> 00:20:21,466
Do you know where your pants are?

267
00:20:22,959 --> 00:20:27,972
- Is this your coat?
- Uh it's my coat...

268
00:20:29,292 --> 00:20:32,100
Wait! wait.
No no. No!

269
00:20:34,334 --> 00:20:37,756
- Where do you live?
- I miss my girlfriend.

270
00:20:37,876 --> 00:20:39,876
God!

271
00:20:48,418 --> 00:20:51,040
- I can't find a local address.
- No problem.

272
00:20:51,175 --> 00:20:55,115
We can drive around, waste off from
gas, all night long, until he sobers up.

273
00:20:55,135 --> 00:20:56,685
- No problem.
- What do you want me to do?

274
00:20:56,686 --> 00:20:59,657
- I don't know, cigaretto.
- I'm not dragging him back out there.

275
00:20:59,692 --> 00:21:01,885
- He's not mine.
- He's not mine.

276
00:21:09,794 --> 00:21:13,768
Hey ... I'm gonna let
you sleep on the couch.

277
00:21:14,494 --> 00:21:18,183
Oh God.  But listen up.
I like to cook ...

278
00:21:18,202 --> 00:21:22,450
So I have knives.
Sharp, dangerous knives.

279
00:21:22,628 --> 00:21:26,099
And if you try
anything, I'll cut you.

280
00:21:26,419 --> 00:21:30,058
- I will cut you in the face!
- You're a very good depressant. Thank you.

281
00:21:30,178 --> 00:21:32,804
- Schooch!
- Alright, let's go.

282

New Balance $ 11,390.52

283
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:15,380
Hello.

284
00:22:20,155 --> 00:22:22,460
Fuck.

285
00:22:36,364 --> 00:22:38,582
You don't have to do that.

286
00:22:40,389 --> 00:22:42,245
Sorry, I ...

287
00:22:42,265 --> 00:22:47,224
Happen to know why I smell faintly
of urine or where my pants might be?

288
00:22:47,358 --> 00:22:49,773
Great mystery!

289
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:53,590
I looked there ...

290
00:22:57,048 --> 00:22:59,048
Here, you can keep 'em.

291
00:22:59,782 --> 00:23:03,197
I should probably just clarify.

292
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:07,746
- I'm not real good with alcohol, I I...
- You don't say.

293
00:23:08,715 --> 00:23:10,275
Thank you for taking me in.

294
00:23:10,276 --> 00:23:13,318
That was very kind of you.
You didn't have to do that.

295
00:23:13,383 --> 00:23:15,847
Ah, yeah, I did actually.

296
00:23:17,465 --> 00:23:21,945
- Are you on vacation here or something?
- Yup, 10 days every year.

297
00:23:21,966 --> 00:23:25,648
One of the many perks of being
an accountant at my firm.

298
00:23:29,549 --> 00:23:33,376
- Would you care for some Biscardi?
- Oh, uh ...

299
00:23:34,841 --> 00:23:37,673
Yeah, thank you.
My stomach is totally empty.

300
00:23:40,092 --> 00:23:41,930
Wow. This is really...
Where did you get these?

301
00:23:41,931 --> 00:23:43,590
I baked them, last night.

302
00:23:43,634 --> 00:23:47,529
Here, you can have some for later.

303
00:23:48,383 --> 00:23:51,207
- You made these?
- For the road.

304
00:23:51,342 --> 00:23:54,480
Oh, no, no, no!
You don't want to get coffee on these.

305
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:58,411
You should really file these.
You should file all these.

306
00:24:00,392 --> 00:24:04,740
I'm sorry, you probably don't want me
handling your private financial documents.

307
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:07,090
- Oh, I don't care.
- Really?

308
00:24:07,226 --> 00:24:10,314
Because I couldn't help noticing, you
know when I was looking for my pants.

309
00:24:10,448 --> 00:24:14,806
I took a quick peek and ...
Do you know how much trouble you're in?

310
00:24:14,826 --> 00:24:18,074
This is what we would call in the
accounting world a "claustrofuck".

311
00:24:18,351 --> 00:24:21,098
- Have you considered a line of credit?
- Right, ...

312
00:24:21,118 --> 00:24:24,773
because banks love giving
money to strippers?

313
00:24:24,794 --> 00:24:28,432
Oh, no!  They won't care as long as you
have assets. Do you own anything of value?

314
00:24:28,552 --> 00:24:31,949
Oh well!  Like this condo.
It's my dad's inheritance.

315
00:24:31,951 --> 00:24:34,993
Oh yeah!  Any bank will
give you a line of credit, okay.

316
00:24:34,994 --> 00:24:36,378
If you decide to pay off your debt.

317
00:24:36,379 --> 00:24:39,619
Life is too short.  I don't waste
time worrying about money.

318
00:24:40,211 --> 00:24:43,082
- You're looking for... You have your coat?
- I was looking for my...

319
00:24:43,402 --> 00:24:45,402
Thank you.

320
00:24:48,136 --> 00:24:50,136
Oh, yeah!

321
00:24:51,545 --> 00:24:54,967
Hey!  Can I ask your professional
opinion about something?

322
00:24:54,987 --> 00:24:59,102
Which of these women appears
to be the most attracted to me?

323
00:25:01,902 --> 00:25:04,046
What are you trying to do exactly?

324
00:25:04,082 --> 00:25:08,213
I proposed to my girlfriend
and... she dumped me.

325
00:25:08,348 --> 00:25:11,983
So I thought I would make her jealous

326
00:25:12,203 --> 00:25:15,536
by showing her how much fun
I was having in Toronto

327
00:25:15,538 --> 00:25:21,553
and showing her that women find me
sexually attractive or something.

328
00:25:21,946 --> 00:25:23,934
Oh my God.

329
00:25:24,053 --> 00:25:26,057
- Okay, sit down.
- Thank you.

330
00:25:26,345 --> 00:25:30,432
Don't have anyone to talk to. It has been
a very difficult time and I would like ...

331
00:25:30,804 --> 00:25:32,804
Oh!  What are you doing?

332
00:25:33,121 --> 00:25:34,706
I'm going to give you a photo.

333
00:25:34,707 --> 00:25:38,783
Gonna make your girlfriend so wet,
she's gonna get a yeast infection.

334
00:25:39,096 --> 00:25:41,496
- Ahh.
- For the "Karma Bank".

335
00:25:42,472 --> 00:25:44,472
Okay.

336
00:25:44,872 --> 00:25:46,760
Make it... A little up more.

337
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,880
- Like this?
- Yeah.

338
00:25:49,513 --> 00:25:51,914
- Okay, say "cheese".
- Cheese.

339
00:25:52,989 --> 00:25:58,020
- I'm Julia, by the way.
- Oh hey, I'm Jordan.

340
00:25:59,164 --> 00:26:00,324
Oh my God!

341
00:26:00,464 --> 00:26:03,054
It's really good. Thank you.
Thank you for that.

342
00:26:03,223 --> 00:26:05,878
And thank you for everything.
Really, my...

343
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:08,351
- Sure, no problem.
- Coffee, thank you for that

344
00:26:08,352 --> 00:26:13,215
and thank you for this.
Really, really this is... wow!

345
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:18,797
Okay, I will go.

346
00:26:19,556 --> 00:26:21,805
- Good luck!
- Bye.  Thank you.

347
00:26:38,765 --> 00:26:41,189
Okay, any... second now.

348
00:27:01,891 --> 00:27:04,806
Kate you know ... hold on.
Sorry!

349
00:27:05,042 --> 00:27:08,148
Here.  You want to
just um... try this?

350
00:27:09,041 --> 00:27:11,042
Thanks!

351
00:27:19,183 --> 00:27:22,030
Oh, that's... Oh I'm sorry!
Wait. Hold on.

352
00:27:22,431 --> 00:27:25,027
Got it right here.
Yup, that's me.

353
00:27:28,875 --> 00:27:30,224
Fucking serious?

354
00:27:34,076 --> 00:27:36,075
I need to call.

355
00:27:53,209 --> 00:27:55,824
- Hey baby!
- Do you think that I'm an idiot? Huh?

356
00:27:55,944 --> 00:27:57,637
Cause that girl's like super hot!

357
00:27:57,657 --> 00:28:01,322
Oh great!  So if I sent you a shot
of me having sex with an ugly girl

358
00:28:01,323 --> 00:28:03,462
- then you would have bought that?
- Yeah, actually.

359
00:28:04,177 --> 00:28:06,031
Is this your version
of leaving me alone?

360
00:28:06,032 --> 00:28:07,731
Cause I don't get it.
What are you trying to proof?

361
00:28:07,766 --> 00:28:11,449
No, I just wanted you to see how
much fun I'm having here in the big city

362
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:13,500
and the T dot O dot plan.

363
00:28:13,501 --> 00:28:16,775
Did you actually hire a model
to try to make me jealous?

364
00:28:16,895 --> 00:28:22,165
Oh my God, did you hire that girl in
Calgary dude?  What's wrong with you?

365
00:28:22,186 --> 00:28:24,438
I miss you and I
just want to start over.

366
00:28:24,439 --> 00:28:26,565
This is so stupid.  Let's just...

367
00:28:26,686 --> 00:28:30,483
- I'll come back to Winnipeg. We'll go on a date.
- You want to come over... and then what huh?

368
00:28:30,603 --> 00:28:33,234
Take me home, undress me
and put me to sleep?

369
00:28:33,235 --> 00:28:36,723
No, thanks, I'm telling you.
Those days are over.

370
00:28:36,853 --> 00:28:40,000
- Well, I can change, okay!
- Look, okay. Yeah. You want to change?

371
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:43,682
If you find some special potion that
magically makes you better in bed

372
00:28:43,683 --> 00:28:45,557
then look me up
otherwise you know what?

373
00:28:45,558 --> 00:28:48,668
Just leave me alone, okay?

374
00:28:49,146 --> 00:28:52,178
Jesus!  Yeah, you know what ...?

375
00:28:59,987 --> 00:29:02,642
- Hey, buddy.
- So I met this stripper named Julia

376
00:29:02,663 --> 00:29:05,366
and she took this like really sexy
photos of me.  And I sent them to Rachel.

377
00:29:05,386 --> 00:29:09,691
Rachel got really pissed off.
So, oh man you're right! You're right!

378
00:29:09,771 --> 00:29:12,499
I need you to teach me
how to fuck real good!  So...

379
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:16,903
Reshma, this is Jordan. He's obviously
got an unusual sense of humor, dude.

380
00:29:16,908 --> 00:29:18,300
Nice to meet you, Jordan.

381
00:29:18,301 --> 00:29:24,516
Listen.  After several failed attempts
by my parents, they did it.  They did it!

382
00:29:24,551 --> 00:29:26,425
Rachel, she's never going to marry me.
She's not going to marry me.

383
00:29:26,426 --> 00:29:28,082
She wants the most...
You teach me how to do sex stuff.

384
00:29:28,083 --> 00:29:30,015
All the sex stuff.  All of it.

385
00:29:30,664 --> 00:29:33,237
What?  How could I
ever help you with that?

386
00:29:33,238 --> 00:29:35,410
What do you mean?  How
could I ever help you with that?

387
00:29:35,445 --> 00:29:39,817
- Duh! You said you'd be my sexual mentor.
- Spiritual... Spiritual mentor!

388
00:29:40,018 --> 00:29:44,682
Not... not sexual.
Spiritual... You misheard.

389
00:29:44,717 --> 00:29:47,611
- I need you to show me how to bang!
- I don't think so...

390
00:29:47,939 --> 00:29:51,184
Excuse me, um...
I'm just going to freshen up.

391
00:29:51,185 --> 00:29:52,603
- Okay.
- While you two talk.

392
00:29:52,604 --> 00:29:54,779
Sure.  Great!
Hey, listen to me.

393
00:29:55,699 --> 00:30:00,498
- I'm gonna miss you.
- Not as much as I'll miss you.

394
00:30:01,023 --> 00:30:03,024
Go.

395
00:30:06,599 --> 00:30:07,864
- Why are you trying to ruin my life?
- What?

396
00:30:07,865 --> 00:30:09,346
I'm sorry.
Not your fault, dude.

397
00:30:10,299 --> 00:30:14,212
- I fell so hard last night.  It's crazy.
- What? So hard. That's not possible.

398
00:30:14,247 --> 00:30:16,212
You don't fall hard.
You're a man whore, man!

399
00:30:16,333 --> 00:30:19,550
No, listen to me. I was... was a man
whore.  This girl, I mean, we're like...

400
00:30:20,566 --> 00:30:26,071
Sipped tea till like 3 in the morning. We
came back here, I bared my soul to her.

401
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:28,731
And then as the sun
came up, we made love.

402
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:29,933
You said you made love?

403
00:30:29,934 --> 00:30:33,245
Yes, this morning we like lay
in each others arms, okay.

404
00:30:33,650 --> 00:30:38,071
Follow me on this.  My penis was not
inside her vagina.  It was amazing.

405
00:30:38,191 --> 00:30:40,231
- That's called "cudzealous"?
- Cuddling.

406
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,430
Right, wow man.
It was like...

407
00:30:42,493 --> 00:30:46,356
you know, waking up from her long
nap, and eating crete scrambled eggs,

408
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:49,114
and being tucked in by your mom
and like peeing in the bath.

409
00:30:49,233 --> 00:30:51,976
All at the same time and even better.
But here's what I want you to know.

410
00:30:52,766 --> 00:30:55,601
Reshma is from a very, very,
very, very traditional family.

411
00:30:55,602 --> 00:30:58,757
She can never know anything
about my dirty, weird, wild past.

412
00:30:58,792 --> 00:31:00,231
You said you bared your soul to her.

413
00:31:00,232 --> 00:31:02,710
Well, yes I did, except
for one tiny omission.

414
00:31:02,801 --> 00:31:05,026
Technically thousands
of gigantic omissions...

415
00:31:05,027 --> 00:31:07,136
No no no no no!
I need the old Dandak back, okay.

416
00:31:07,171 --> 00:31:10,351
The old Dandak got to teach me his
tricks and go out and talk to girls for me

417
00:31:10,352 --> 00:31:12,469
and have them sleep with
me so that I can get better ...

418
00:31:12,551 --> 00:31:14,165
No, I have to
concentrate on this, okay.

419
00:31:14,166 --> 00:31:16,829
You need to consider that
Dandak gone right now.  Okay?

420
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:20,204
- No, I can do this by myself then.
- No you absolutely cannot...

421
00:31:20,205 --> 00:31:22,837
do this by yourself, alright.
You need intensive training.

422
00:31:22,838 --> 00:31:25,256
- You need like a Jedi master.
- Yes, yes, I need a Yoda!

423
00:31:25,257 --> 00:31:26,140
Yes a Yoda.

424
00:31:26,141 --> 00:31:30,524
Except more more *** things like, the
four quadrants of the clitoris or the ...

425
00:31:30,543 --> 00:31:33,660
What's it for...?  Quadrants?
What is that? What is that?

426
00:31:34,086 --> 00:31:37,761
Okay listen to me.  The human
female clitoris has four quadrants.

427
00:31:38,903 --> 00:31:42,758
Fast forward okay. When one is stimulating
said clitoris manually or orally

428
00:31:42,793 --> 00:31:46,636
one must focus one's attention
on the upper left quadrant.

429
00:31:46,686 --> 00:31:48,082
- Say it back to me.
- The upper left quadrant.

430
00:31:48,083 --> 00:31:50,437
How is that possible?  The whole
thing is like microscopic to start with.

431
00:31:50,438 --> 00:31:52,100
How do you then divide
into four then target...?

432
00:31:52,102 --> 00:31:56,451
That's when you know.
You just know.

433
00:31:57,646 --> 00:32:00,697
Oh!  Hi.

434
00:32:01,111 --> 00:32:06,304
Listen to me.  You can never
go to the bathroom alone again.

435
00:32:06,719 --> 00:32:09,969
I missed you way too much.

436
00:32:12,029 --> 00:32:14,029
I won't.

437
00:32:31,363 --> 00:32:34,654
There is a difference between
a stripper and a prostitute.

438
00:32:35,863 --> 00:32:38,000
Okay, to be fair there's
a lot of girls in my work

439
00:32:38,001 --> 00:32:41,153
who would have sex with you for
money, but it's just not my thing.

440
00:32:41,181 --> 00:32:44,738
No no no no!   Of course I
know you're not a prostitute.

441
00:32:44,773 --> 00:32:48,716
Okay this morning when
I was here, I peeked in your ...

442
00:32:49,957 --> 00:32:52,372
... your things.

443
00:32:55,496 --> 00:32:58,605
Oh my God!  You can't
even say "vibrator"!

444
00:32:59,406 --> 00:33:02,177
Yes, I own a vibrator.

445
00:33:02,326 --> 00:33:05,647
And I also have various lubricants.

446
00:33:05,864 --> 00:33:08,826
I occasionally enjoy
watching some porn.

447
00:33:08,827 --> 00:33:11,163
I mean, I don't know what
any of this has to do with...

448
00:33:11,198 --> 00:33:13,001
Seriously.
This is exactly what I mean.

449
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:16,426
Look at you.  You're just like
so comfortable with yourself.

450
00:33:16,498 --> 00:33:21,552
And so confident you know.  It's this
confidence that I... has eluded me.

451
00:33:21,673 --> 00:33:24,478
I'm really sorry about your girlfriend
and your whole situation,

452
00:33:24,497 --> 00:33:29,052
but the bottom-line is just that...
I don't need any help.

453
00:33:29,245 --> 00:33:34,299
I... it's under control,
so... thanks anyways.

454
00:33:34,532 --> 00:33:38,198
Julia, this is a "classic fuck".

455
00:33:46,683 --> 00:33:49,483
They canceled my credit cards.

456
00:33:53,324 --> 00:33:56,365
See?
See, this is what I'm saying.

457
00:33:56,616 --> 00:34:00,521
Okay, we need to get this straight
now... before it gets even worse.

458
00:34:00,541 --> 00:34:03,352
But it is not too late, because
I can help you right now, okay.

459
00:34:03,372 --> 00:34:06,611
I can help you set up that line of
credit and consolidate your debts.

460
00:34:06,659 --> 00:34:11,552
- Okay, okay fine.  I'll be your sexiator.
- Really?  You mean it?

461
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:16,440
Okay! This is great!
So I'm only here for five days.

462
00:34:16,450 --> 00:34:20,399
Alright, I thought we could start maybe
with some pointers, right?  Some tips.

463
00:34:20,575 --> 00:34:23,822
- What are you doing?
- Taking out my ...

464
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,400
Oh, no. No that's not...

465
00:34:27,993 --> 00:34:30,856
No you think that I'm ...
I didn't mean to imply ...

466
00:34:31,076 --> 00:34:34,555
I was thinking it would be like
a class... like instructional right,

467
00:34:34,676 --> 00:34:38,504
like teachers do and
mentor... it's like Yoda.

468
00:34:38,642 --> 00:34:41,081
Yoda didn't fuck Luke Skywalker.

469
00:34:41,201 --> 00:34:45,034
He rode around on his back and taught
him how to move things with his brain.

470
00:34:45,243 --> 00:34:49,491
- So they kept their pants on, right?
- Yes, they kept their pants on.

471
00:34:49,511 --> 00:34:53,949
Mm, let's figure out how to save my ass.
Tell me what the first step is.

472
00:34:54,068 --> 00:34:57,016
Let's get that ball rolling and then
we can work on your problem.

473
00:34:57,036 --> 00:34:59,714
Okay, first step.  I'm meeting
with your bank manager.

474
00:34:59,715 --> 00:35:01,116
I have a bank manager?

475
00:35:01,151 --> 00:35:02,868
Yeah, I mean you have
a bank account, right?

476
00:35:02,869 --> 00:35:05,022
- Yeah.
- Yeah, you have a bank manager.

477
00:35:05,057 --> 00:35:08,999
Okay, if I can just like... I just
call him up and ask for a meeting?

478
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,982
Yeah, it's really easy. You just call the
number on the back of your card and...

479
00:35:13,661 --> 00:35:15,661
- Really?
- Yes!

480
00:35:28,878 --> 00:35:32,306
These are just a pair of labias.

481
00:35:32,916 --> 00:35:37,167
Labi ... Labii ...

482
00:35:38,937 --> 00:35:44,037
Labia.  Big pink vibrator.

483
00:35:53,712 --> 00:35:56,858
They gave me a meeting for tomorrow!

484
00:35:58,371 --> 00:35:59,834
- Rub and tug!
- What?

485
00:35:59,835 --> 00:36:03,533
That's a good idea!
Lesson 1.  Let's go.

486
00:36:03,568 --> 00:36:06,504
LESSON 1:
Rub and Tug.

487
00:36:07,497 --> 00:36:10,948
- How I can I help you today?
- We today...

488
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:14,535
would like...

489
00:36:17,289 --> 00:36:20,755
- A massage?
- Yes, a massage.

490
00:36:20,813 --> 00:36:24,059
A sexual massage.

491
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:27,880
$ 40.  Anything else is extra
and is discussed in the room.

492
00:36:28,223 --> 00:36:29,991
Wait over there while
I take your boyfriend.

493
00:36:29,992 --> 00:36:30,783
Okay, see you later.

494
00:36:30,784 --> 00:36:34,018
Wait wait wait wait.
She's coming in with me.

495
00:36:34,053 --> 00:36:36,850
Sorry, hon, more than 2 people
in the room, it's against the law.

496
00:36:36,851 --> 00:36:37,973
That's against the law?

497
00:36:38,498 --> 00:36:42,459
Well, I guess, this wasn't
meant to be.   It's too bad.

498
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:43,809
Really?

499
00:36:44,748 --> 00:36:47,586
Okay, whatever you say, boss.  Let's
go back to my place and get to work.

500
00:36:47,706 --> 00:36:49,706
Wait!

501
00:36:50,815 --> 00:36:53,972
I don't understand how this is
supposed to make me better at sex?

502
00:36:58,081 --> 00:37:01,105
Ok ok ok, I'm ready.

503
00:37:07,416 --> 00:37:10,648
- Do not come.
- Excuse me?

504
00:37:11,249 --> 00:37:15,796
These women, they are trained to make
you blow your wad as quickly as possible.

505
00:37:15,916 --> 00:37:20,362
If you can hold your load with her,
you can hold your load with anyone.

506
00:37:20,582 --> 00:37:23,140
Beware okay.
They will have tricks.

507
00:37:23,624 --> 00:37:25,625
Powerful tricks.

508
00:37:43,142 --> 00:37:45,742
Hey honey, I'm Sapphire.

509
00:37:46,167 --> 00:37:50,130
That's not your real name.  Alright.
You people don't use your real name.

510
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:54,898
I don't mean "you people".
I mean not a racist kind of way.

511
00:37:55,017 --> 00:37:57,395
I'm Jordan... Kevin.
I'll be Kevin.

512
00:37:57,415 --> 00:37:59,652
- Is this you first time, honey?
- No.

513
00:37:59,673 --> 00:38:03,829
I had a hot stone massage
once in a resort hotel in Mexico.

514
00:38:03,849 --> 00:38:06,220
And the hot stones were
very hot and burned my back.

515
00:38:06,221 --> 00:38:08,304
You know what?  I'm actually
feeling a bit nauseous.

516
00:38:08,339 --> 00:38:10,798
Oh just relax, Kevin.
It's just gonna be great.

517
00:38:10,799 --> 00:38:11,899
Yeah.

518
00:38:22,185 --> 00:38:25,209
Is this table sanitary?

519
00:38:25,377 --> 00:38:28,557
Yup, all of the soiled linen
are thrown right over there.

520
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:57,420
Okay.

521
00:38:58,629 --> 00:39:00,628
Here we go.

522
00:39:11,087 --> 00:39:15,354
- Oh, do you want to look at my tits?
- No, thanks, I'm good.

523
00:39:18,462 --> 00:39:24,318
Okay... Oh she gonna climb.
Climb right out.

524
00:39:27,129 --> 00:39:29,130
No.

525
00:39:29,629 --> 00:39:31,711
No, no, no.

526
00:39:32,338 --> 00:39:34,338
No! No, no, no.

527
00:39:36,755 --> 00:39:39,380
Puke. Vomit.

528
00:39:40,245 --> 00:39:43,274
Sick.  Burnt victims.
People on fire.

529
00:39:43,310 --> 00:39:45,727
Very bad skin. Faces are burned.

530
00:39:45,862 --> 00:39:48,289
Their faces are very burned.

531
00:39:48,681 --> 00:39:50,568
No ...

532
00:39:50,588 --> 00:39:54,104
Alright baby, you got a real big
cock there.  It's looking really good.

533
00:39:54,722 --> 00:39:56,922
- Good job.
- Mom!

534
00:39:57,172 --> 00:40:03,045
Come in my mouth, baby.  Spray
your hot jizz all over my face.

535
00:40:04,322 --> 00:40:05,660
No, no, no!

536
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:09,178
Need some help baby, you
want me to squeeze your balls?

537
00:40:09,298 --> 00:40:11,298
No! Please no!

538
00:40:12,048 --> 00:40:14,628
Oh my God, ouch!
My fucking eyes!

539
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:18,139
I'm sorry!

540
00:40:18,823 --> 00:40:21,224
Violation in Room 3.

541
00:40:21,756 --> 00:40:24,603
- That's your boyfriend.
- He's not my boyfriend.

542
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:29,179
- Are you okay?
- Oh my God.  Break my nose!

543
00:40:29,299 --> 00:40:32,721
- Oh my God, what are you doing?
- Nothing...

544
00:40:42,707 --> 00:40:44,479
- Does it hurt?
- Ow!

545
00:40:44,499 --> 00:40:47,457
Oh my God!  You're
such a baby. You barely ...

546
00:40:48,858 --> 00:40:50,857
Hey.

547
00:40:51,907 --> 00:40:55,866
I'm afraid that we're not going
to be able to use the condo

548
00:40:55,867 --> 00:40:57,909
as collateral on the line of credits.

549
00:40:57,944 --> 00:41:01,484
- Why not?
- Our record show that in 2008,

550
00:41:01,641 --> 00:41:06,899
Ms Bowe borrowed on her mortgage to make
a series of cash purchases that totaled

551
00:41:07,558 --> 00:41:10,138
just over $ 70,000.

552
00:41:10,258 --> 00:41:13,306
And you fail to mention this?
Why exactly?

553
00:41:14,508 --> 00:41:18,988
You said, as long as I owned my condo,
that the bank would give me a loan.

554
00:41:19,009 --> 00:41:23,447
Yes, but you left out a tiny detail
about borrowing against your...

555
00:41:23,467 --> 00:41:28,050
I didn't even remember until just
now when this guy brought it up.

556
00:41:29,092 --> 00:41:32,753
And... in fact what happened here was

557
00:41:32,932 --> 00:41:37,442
that I called the number on the back of
my credit card to ask for more money

558
00:41:37,463 --> 00:41:40,057
and there was a woman
on the phone who said:

559
00:41:40,177 --> 00:41:43,553
Uh, you qualify for a
some mortgage thingy

560
00:41:43,574 --> 00:41:47,548
- so I was like ok and signed some papers.
- You know what, no problem.

561
00:41:47,667 --> 00:41:50,846
It's okay.  Plan B.
Alright.  No problem.

562
00:41:51,477 --> 00:41:56,766
- We'd like to apply for a loan, please.
- Excellent. That is an excellent idea.

563
00:41:56,885 --> 00:41:59,701
I like that.  Let's...
We can do that!

564
00:42:00,968 --> 00:42:04,259
I'll just get the paperwork
started here and...

565
00:42:04,894 --> 00:42:10,042
Ms. Bowe can let me know who
she'd like to have as her co-signer...

566
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,482
About what now?

567
00:42:12,603 --> 00:42:14,766
Well, seeing you have
tied up on your asset,

568
00:42:14,767 --> 00:42:18,803
you need someone to co-sign for your loan
to assume equal liability as a guarantee

569
00:42:18,838 --> 00:42:22,091
that the bank will get their money
back if you fail to make your payments.

570
00:42:22,211 --> 00:42:25,218
- Standard.
- It can be anyone, really!

571
00:42:25,352 --> 00:42:27,039
As long as they have
a good credit rating

572
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:29,848
and you've know them for
a minimum of five years.

573
00:42:30,262 --> 00:42:32,261
Five.

574
00:42:34,970 --> 00:42:37,818
Like, a parent is common.

575
00:42:38,512 --> 00:42:41,160
Or sibling.

576
00:42:42,829 --> 00:42:45,529
A friend, a friend will do.

577
00:42:49,145 --> 00:42:54,272
They are strippers.  So they have assets,
but not the kind you're talking about.

578
00:43:00,662 --> 00:43:04,458
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
- I knew this was a stupid idea.

579
00:43:05,013 --> 00:43:08,935
- How much do you make in your job?
- I don't know.

580
00:43:10,264 --> 00:43:13,434
- Last night I made...
- Oh my God!

581
00:43:15,555 --> 00:43:20,621
- No, no, no. Ok, let's put it back in.
- Six hundred... ish.

582
00:43:20,741 --> 00:43:23,750
- Six hundred dollars?
- It was a slow night.

583
00:43:23,870 --> 00:43:26,024
We can get you straightened
out real quick, Julia.

584
00:43:26,025 --> 00:43:26,965
- Really?
- Yeah.

585
00:43:27,041 --> 00:43:29,313
I can take care of it.
I'll set you up on a budget.

586
00:43:29,314 --> 00:43:31,510
I'll review your expense
or crunch the numbers.

587
00:43:31,515 --> 00:43:36,705
We don't need a stupid bank, Julia.
Who needs... banks are for suckers, right?

588
00:43:39,731 --> 00:43:42,132
You have to try this.

589
00:43:42,972 --> 00:43:45,786
Come here. I got them from
the South Australian coast.

590
00:43:46,390 --> 00:43:49,656
Oh no, I don't really like those!

591
00:43:50,932 --> 00:43:54,624
- Have you ever tried oysters?
- No, I could just tell.

592
00:43:54,848 --> 00:43:56,848
Come here.

593
00:44:00,223 --> 00:44:02,607
- Oh my God.
- Okay, okay.

594
00:44:02,933 --> 00:44:05,778
- What do I do, I just...
- That's... well done.

595
00:44:07,349 --> 00:44:09,870
- Okay?
- Lemony.

596
00:44:09,991 --> 00:44:12,037
- Oh come on.
- No, it's good!

597
00:44:12,171 --> 00:44:14,195
- It's good.
- Right!

598
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:16,271
It's okay!

599
00:44:16,391 --> 00:44:18,182
Sorry, I notice you don't seem to

600
00:44:18,183 --> 00:44:22,181
subscribe to the whole
"clean as you cook" philosophy.

601
00:44:22,583 --> 00:44:25,841
- It's not really priority for you.
- Uh mm.

602
00:44:26,833 --> 00:44:29,707
Don't be afraid to get dirty.
Come here.

603
00:44:29,743 --> 00:44:32,913
Oh, this is not bare
hands wash shrimp.

604
00:44:33,034 --> 00:44:36,132
No, my... the Jewish people were not
technically allowed to handle shrimp

605
00:44:36,133 --> 00:44:38,262
unless we're eating in
a Chinese restaurant.

606
00:44:38,297 --> 00:44:40,405
- Okay, come on, get in there!
- I am orthodox.

607
00:44:40,425 --> 00:44:44,059
- Get in there. Peel 'em off.
- Like this.

608
00:44:44,692 --> 00:44:50,055
Okay now... try...
Can we have some dirty talk?

609
00:44:50,943 --> 00:44:53,784
What?
I don't know if I can.

610
00:44:54,134 --> 00:44:56,175
Come on, try.
One dirty word.

611
00:44:57,737 --> 00:44:58,970
Moist?

612
00:45:00,011 --> 00:45:03,133
- Are you serious?
- Yeah, like: Oh baby, I'm so moist.

613
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:07,360
- You're a guy, why are you moist?
- No, I'm not. Forget it. Fine.  Hard?

614
00:45:07,479 --> 00:45:12,095
- Used in a sentence.
- This is very hard for me.

615
00:45:12,326 --> 00:45:14,553
Weak, try again.

616
00:45:14,713 --> 00:45:17,892
- You making me so hard.
- I do?

617
00:45:18,027 --> 00:45:20,821
No, no!
Not for real.

618
00:45:22,186 --> 00:45:27,215
- Well, I'll be exactly as hard?
- My wiener. My dicky.

619
00:45:27,235 --> 00:45:29,274
Try a "cock".
- My cock?

620
00:45:29,394 --> 00:45:31,607
- What about your cock?
- My cock should be alright.

621
00:45:31,727 --> 00:45:34,382
- What do you want to do with it?
- Mm, insert it...

622
00:45:34,502 --> 00:45:37,966
- Tell me what you want to do with it?
- I want it near ...

623
00:45:38,186 --> 00:45:40,709
Come on, tell me what you want
to do with your big hard cock?

624
00:45:40,710 --> 00:45:41,910
Okay, I want to put my own cock...

625
00:45:41,986 --> 00:45:44,197
Tell me what you want to
do with your big hard cock?

626
00:45:44,198 --> 00:45:45,719
I'll slam it inside your pussy.

627
00:45:47,495 --> 00:45:49,995
Yeah, that wasn't bad.
It's okay.

628
00:45:57,345 --> 00:45:59,645
Delicious!
So good!

629
00:45:59,895 --> 00:46:03,025
It's so good!
How do you do this?

630
00:46:03,245 --> 00:46:06,448
I made sure the shrimps
are poached gently.

631
00:46:06,449 --> 00:46:07,449
The curry has to be
spicy but not too spicy.

632
00:46:09,228 --> 00:46:10,958
And the "Basmati".
That's the thing.

633
00:46:10,959 --> 00:46:13,959
I have this guy who gets it shipped
in from the Himalayan foothills

634
00:46:14,092 --> 00:46:18,437
which... that's the best 'Basmati' in the
world.  So... that makes a difference.

635
00:46:23,145 --> 00:46:25,146
Really?

636
00:46:25,837 --> 00:46:28,637
This is literally the best cheesecake
I've ever tasted in my life.

637
00:46:28,921 --> 00:46:32,129
I'm not kidding.  I'm sorry I keep...
Everything you make is a...

638
00:46:32,130 --> 00:46:34,230
Where did you train?
You must have trained.

639
00:46:34,232 --> 00:46:37,800
Did you go to culinary school, or
you worked as a professional chef?

640
00:46:37,806 --> 00:46:39,693
Well, you should.  I mean have
you thought about that?

641
00:46:39,694 --> 00:46:43,173
Have you considered
doing this as a career?

642
00:46:43,605 --> 00:46:45,605
No.

643
00:46:45,730 --> 00:46:49,354
- Oh my God!  You have!
- I have this idea.

644
00:46:49,704 --> 00:46:51,274
It's totally unrealistic,

645
00:46:51,275 --> 00:46:55,960
but I came up with this
restaurant called the "Aphrodisiac".

646
00:46:56,022 --> 00:47:00,188
Anise, dark chocolate,
with basil, honey, garlic.

647
00:47:02,422 --> 00:47:05,903
Classic wine bar with essential twist.

648
00:47:06,022 --> 00:47:08,653
- It's a great concept.
- Whatever!  It's just an idea.

649
00:47:08,773 --> 00:47:11,973
Hey. No!
It's really... It's a great concept.

650
00:47:12,697 --> 00:47:17,106
I've looked around, ok.  I've seen your
condo, seen all the stuff you collected.

651
00:47:17,273 --> 00:47:20,050
You may say that your idea is unrealistic,

652
00:47:20,051 --> 00:47:22,533
but I don't know,
it looks pretty realistic to me.

653
00:47:22,568 --> 00:47:24,810
Whatever.  As you can see
I'm not good with money

654
00:47:24,811 --> 00:47:28,429
so, it's kind of a prerequisite
starting a restaurant won't you say?

655
00:47:28,549 --> 00:47:31,855
You  know, well, you know,
maybe it's a vicious circle.

656
00:47:33,441 --> 00:47:38,280
Maybe you spend all this money on all
that stuff because you're unhappy

657
00:47:38,417 --> 00:47:41,565
in your career and you're
trying like fill the hole in your life.

658
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:44,623
And you say you're bad with money,
because that gives you an out, you know,

659
00:47:44,624 --> 00:47:50,480
from taking a risk and trying something
that will make you really happy.

660
00:47:55,566 --> 00:47:59,357
Blah, blah, blah.
What do I...? Why am I even...?

661
00:48:00,942 --> 00:48:03,521
Psycho babble, I don't
know what I'm talking about.

662
00:48:03,899 --> 00:48:06,914
This is why I don't... drink.

663
00:48:06,947 --> 00:48:08,237
I start...

664
00:48:08,375 --> 00:48:11,355
I should probably get to work.
I got a lot of work to get through, okay.

665
00:48:12,217 --> 00:48:15,462
- Yeah, I got to get ready for work.
- Okay.

666
00:48:15,658 --> 00:48:18,858
- You're done with it.
- No, I'm going to hold on to this.

667
00:48:19,283 --> 00:48:22,298
- Good night.
- Thank you for dinner.

668
00:48:22,743 --> 00:48:25,143
Seriously.
Amazing dinner!

669
00:48:33,651 --> 00:48:35,651
Oh my God!

670
00:48:35,993 --> 00:48:39,375
Have you managed
to unfuck my "cluster"?

671
00:48:39,426 --> 00:48:42,277
I'm working on it, it's not
going to be easy though.

672
00:48:42,298 --> 00:48:46,197
With all your bills and your
credit card debts and your

673
00:48:46,318 --> 00:48:49,952
unopened notices from "Skeets Rental".
What is that?

674
00:48:50,086 --> 00:48:53,465
Oh I was told that if I rent my
furniture, I could write it off.

675
00:48:53,485 --> 00:48:57,423
- Well, did you do it?
- Well, would have if they pay my taxes.

676
00:48:58,577 --> 00:49:02,227
- Should I be worried?
- No, I'm going to handle all that.

677
00:49:02,346 --> 00:49:05,746
You just need to worry about following
this... budget cause I made it for you

678
00:49:06,053 --> 00:49:08,648
okay and making all
these quotas that work.

679
00:49:08,828 --> 00:49:11,859
And for God's sake, woman,
stop spending so much money!

680
00:49:11,985 --> 00:49:16,369
Okay, you can't spend $ 1,000
on white truffles from Tasmania.

681
00:49:16,505 --> 00:49:19,932
That's not... No no more.
Okay you gotta save your money.

682
00:49:20,185 --> 00:49:22,941
- Alright?  Alright?
- Okay!

683
00:49:23,142 --> 00:49:25,142
Look!

684
00:49:26,427 --> 00:49:27,863
My money.

685
00:49:33,778 --> 00:49:36,662
- Saved!
- Good!  Okay.

686
00:49:36,796 --> 00:49:39,428
So, we're gonna start with groceries.

687
00:49:39,470 --> 00:49:42,951
Okay, no more fancy smanzy
organic foods for you.

688
00:49:43,071 --> 00:49:47,482
Tomorrow morning you're going to
meet me at 10 am at "Extra Foods".

689
00:49:47,602 --> 00:49:49,602
"Extra Foods"!

690
00:49:51,821 --> 00:49:53,910
- You're serious.
- Yes

691
00:49:53,943 --> 00:49:56,196
- Hey, Jules!
- Hey.

692
00:49:56,996 --> 00:49:58,996
That's my neighbor - Naked Tom.

693
00:49:59,130 --> 00:50:02,733
Yeah, I'm making scrambled
eggs, but I'm out of eggs.

694
00:50:04,154 --> 00:50:06,800
A splash of cream.
Add just a splash.

695
00:50:08,263 --> 00:50:10,262
Ah, Jordan - Tom.
Tom - Jordan.

696
00:50:10,322 --> 00:50:13,142
- What's up Jordan?
- Hey, how is it going?
- Good.

697
00:50:13,747 --> 00:50:16,612
- Is there something wrong?
- No.

698
00:50:18,414 --> 00:50:20,609
You got a problem with
the naked male form?

699
00:50:20,610 --> 00:50:22,757
No, I'm not. I don't... No.

700
00:50:23,913 --> 00:50:27,094
Because you're avoiding direct
eye contact with my penis.

701
00:50:27,114 --> 00:50:32,011
Oh no!  I was just giving
you privacy, that's all.

702
00:50:32,032 --> 00:50:34,331
I mean... It has been cool.
It get pretty cool.

703
00:50:34,573 --> 00:50:38,197
Jordan, I don't mind you looking.
Go ahead.

704
00:50:39,031 --> 00:50:42,228
- Tom's got a beautiful penis.
- Ummph?

705
00:50:43,064 --> 00:50:45,311
Wow, it's a beautiful penis.

706
00:50:46,631 --> 00:50:48,413
Take a good long look.

707
00:50:52,839 --> 00:50:55,040
Superb.

708
00:50:55,215 --> 00:50:58,361
Sexual insecurity is so unattractive.

709
00:50:58,532 --> 00:51:02,395
What?  I just saw your another one of
your penis for an hour. What's that?

710
00:51:02,515 --> 00:51:05,762
A splash of cream, thanks.
Got it.

711
00:51:06,765 --> 00:51:11,365
- He's got issues, Jules.
- How's that?  I do not think I ...

712
00:51:13,265 --> 00:51:15,566
Do I have issues?

713
00:51:15,875 --> 00:51:19,430
Lesson 3:
Confronting Issues

714
00:51:36,683 --> 00:51:39,083
It looks good.

715
00:51:40,616 --> 00:51:43,475
Wow, this is crazy!

716
00:51:43,833 --> 00:51:46,033
Hey, let's go out!

717
00:51:46,201 --> 00:51:48,868
- You're in a dress.
- I know. But I'm thinking...

718
00:51:49,067 --> 00:51:51,034
I don't know.  If we're going
to do this.  Let's do it right.

719
00:51:51,035 --> 00:51:54,504
Let's experience it.  Let's take
it outside like in the world.

720
00:51:54,539 --> 00:51:57,637
And I'm only gonna do this once,
so why not go for it, right?

721
00:51:57,773 --> 00:52:01,772
- Quick, before I loose my nerve.
- I'll get your purse.

722
00:52:03,335 --> 00:52:07,092
I'm not even embarrassed!
Hi!  I'm wearing panties.

723
00:52:07,326 --> 00:52:11,928
I can't believe how good I feel.  And I
really feel kind of neutral, you know?

724
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:16,233
Yeah. I mean it's like I'm
totally anonymous, you know?

725
00:52:18,202 --> 00:52:21,291
Did you hear that?  I think I just...
I think I just got objectified.

726
00:52:21,410 --> 00:52:24,823
- And you loved it!
- I did love it!  I loved it.

727
00:52:24,943 --> 00:52:27,361
Hey, gorgeous!

728
00:52:27,662 --> 00:52:30,663
Oh, she just touched my package!

729
00:52:31,361 --> 00:52:33,760
- Say "horny"!
- Horny!  What is that?

730
00:52:33,953 --> 00:52:37,721
Oh, no no no!  Excuse me,
I'm gonna need those photos.

731
00:52:37,875 --> 00:52:40,875
Oh, you can download it off my Blog.

732
00:52:41,068 --> 00:52:46,293
"Cock" slash @ blogspot,
double backslash dot CA.

733
00:52:46,454 --> 00:52:49,223
- I'm uploading them right now.
- No, wait wait wait wait!

734
00:52:49,344 --> 00:52:51,118
I'm not... I have
a girlfriend and she's...

735
00:52:51,119 --> 00:52:54,206
I'm really sure that your girlfriend
doesn't read cock slash.

736
00:52:56,379 --> 00:52:58,867
And besides you're anonymous.

737
00:52:58,937 --> 00:53:02,209
- You're completely unrecognizable.
- I am ain't I?

738
00:53:02,329 --> 00:53:05,144
Jordan?
Jordan Abrams.

739
00:53:07,870 --> 00:53:10,584
Rabbi Finkelstein?
Wow.  What are you ...?

740
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:13,920
Oh, Esther and I are in town
for the week, visiting Osley.

741
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:16,400
Yeah!

742
00:53:17,454 --> 00:53:19,891
No! No!
I'm sorry!

743
00:53:20,288 --> 00:53:22,720
I'm sorry.

744
00:53:23,820 --> 00:53:27,432
Scrotum just slap on...
Slap!

745
00:53:39,022 --> 00:53:42,842
...Married, had two boys and a little girl.
- Oh, how sweet.

746
00:53:43,731 --> 00:53:47,971
This is Julia, she's my client.
I'm here on business.

747
00:53:48,122 --> 00:53:52,322
- Right, right. Your accounting.
- Yeah, this is Rabbi Finkelstein.

748
00:53:52,756 --> 00:53:57,555
He was my Hebrew teacher and
he officiated at my "Bar Mitzvah".

749
00:53:57,699 --> 00:54:00,916
Right! Jordan sang so beautifully.

750
00:54:01,048 --> 00:54:04,824
His voice had to change as he
was able to hit all those high notes.

751
00:54:05,732 --> 00:54:09,955
Well, it's been really great seeing you
Rabbi, but we gotta get going so...

752
00:54:10,331 --> 00:54:11,837
Shalom!

753
00:54:11,956 --> 00:54:14,769
You're live on "CKND"
national television.

754
00:54:14,889 --> 00:54:18,270
It is a brisk autumn night
here in the provincial capital

755
00:54:18,490 --> 00:54:20,104
<i>hundreds of men and women,</i>

756
00:54:20,105 --> 00:54:24,621
<i>boys and girls of all ages from
enjoying a big night of debauchery...</i>

757
00:54:24,915 --> 00:54:28,170
Esther!
Look who it is!

758
00:54:28,290 --> 00:54:30,290
Jordan.
Jordan Abrams!

759
00:54:30,790 --> 00:54:33,920
Do you remember?
The accountant from Winnipeg.

760
00:54:34,291 --> 00:54:37,133
<i>Here on legendary Church Street
in downtown Toronto,</i>

761
00:54:37,134 --> 00:54:39,820
<i>the gay, lesbians and
transgender community,</i>

762
00:54:39,855 --> 00:54:43,114
<i>led by one of bank
accountant Jordan Abrams,</i>

763
00:54:43,310 --> 00:54:47,205
<i>celebrates in grandeur style.
I'm currently standing...</i>

764
00:54:48,174 --> 00:54:50,546
- Hello?
- Yeah!  It is you!

765
00:54:50,666 --> 00:54:54,071
- What? Whatever do you mean?
- Are you wearing a dress?

766
00:54:54,392 --> 00:54:57,090
No, I'm not.
I don't think so.

767
00:54:57,759 --> 00:55:00,738
You're on live television and...

768
00:55:00,858 --> 00:55:03,248
- What are you doing?
- Look, I can explain, okay.

769
00:55:03,374 --> 00:55:08,163
No, Rachel I'm confronting
my sexual insecurities and I'm...

770
00:55:08,225 --> 00:55:11,166
- Embracing your feminine quality.
- Embracing my feminine qualities.

771
00:55:11,275 --> 00:55:12,287
Who's that girl?

772
00:55:12,288 --> 00:55:14,488
What girl?  There's
no girl.  I don't know...

773
00:55:17,167 --> 00:55:19,411
No, wait. Rachel!
Rachel!

774
00:55:28,059 --> 00:55:31,840
Well, good night.  Hope to see
you in... over the high holidays.

775
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:35,744
Don't worry, Jordan.
Your little secret's safe with me.

776
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:38,660
Thanks.

777
00:55:39,751 --> 00:55:42,939
- He says you don't worry...
- Right.

778
00:55:43,501 --> 00:55:47,319
Well, I gotta go home and kill
myself now.  So, good night.

779
00:55:48,026 --> 00:55:52,485
We're still on for tomorrow
morning, right?  "Extra Foods"!

780
00:55:57,443 --> 00:56:00,047
- Hi, Mom.
- Hello, sweetheart.

781
00:56:00,181 --> 00:56:04,071
- How are you doing? Are you good?
- I am just fine.

782
00:56:04,252 --> 00:56:07,854
Aside the fact that
my son is a fagalot!

783
00:57:46,615 --> 00:57:48,586
Hey!

784
00:57:48,606 --> 00:57:53,123
I thought you weren't coming.
I got the shitty cheese!

785
00:57:53,149 --> 00:57:58,253
I'm going home to beg Rachel to
take me back before it's too late.

786
00:57:58,923 --> 00:58:04,041
- What about your side of the deal?
- You know your budget, you gonna do great.

787
00:58:04,066 --> 00:58:09,235
- Okay.  Good luck!
- No no, I need you now! Just...

788
00:58:12,841 --> 00:58:16,447
I called the agent this morning.
It is totally reasonable.

789
00:58:16,667 --> 00:58:20,261
It's the perfect location,
it's move in ready.

790
00:58:20,481 --> 00:58:23,908
- I can guess you'd take it, right?
- Yeah, I don't know.

791
00:58:24,128 --> 00:58:27,946
If I were your accountant, I'd advise you
against it, till you pay off your debts.

792
00:58:27,967 --> 00:58:30,234
You know, but I have
most of the furnishings

793
00:58:30,235 --> 00:58:31,860
and most of the
equipment in my condo, right?

794
00:58:31,867 --> 00:58:36,819
So, all I need is just like a crash
course, on just the basics,

795
00:58:36,842 --> 00:58:40,202
because I have
to act fast for this...

796
00:58:40,203 --> 00:58:43,752
No, I have a plane
I have to catch.  Sorry.

797
00:58:45,035 --> 00:58:49,847
So Rachel yells at you and you
scurry back on your hands and knees?

798
00:58:49,867 --> 00:58:51,934
You're going home a bigger
pussy than when you left.

799
00:58:51,935 --> 00:58:53,530
Oh, that's really nice.

800
00:58:53,532 --> 00:58:55,113
What's gonna happen
when you have sex?

801
00:58:55,414 --> 00:58:59,401
She's gonna be like fast asleep
before your ass hits the sheets.

802
00:59:01,384 --> 00:59:05,426
Did Luke Skywalker
bail halfway through?

803
00:59:06,159 --> 00:59:11,762
No, right. He went back to that swamp
place and he finished his training.

804
00:59:13,052 --> 00:59:15,521
And what happened
to Luke Skywalker?

805
00:59:15,722 --> 00:59:17,999
I don't know.  Cried a lot,
he got his hand cut off...

806
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:22,151
He became next Jedi master, right?
Because he saw it through.

807
00:59:23,019 --> 00:59:27,019
Shut up, Jordan!  Just stop
frushing me and do what I say!

808
00:59:27,144 --> 00:59:29,154
Ok, I'm sorry.

809
00:59:32,077 --> 00:59:35,678
Seriously?
That was way too easy.

810
00:59:36,802 --> 00:59:38,802
Hey ...

811
00:59:40,644 --> 00:59:43,255
Oh my God, I know what you need.

812
00:59:43,420 --> 00:59:46,112
- My place, tonight 8.
- I can't come.

813
00:59:46,247 --> 00:59:48,473
- Be there!
- Okay.

814
00:59:48,736 --> 00:59:51,136
Suck in your ...

815
00:59:51,770 --> 00:59:53,416
There.

816
00:59:53,536 --> 00:59:56,347
Yeah, it's difficult to
imagine this ending well.

817
00:59:56,348 --> 00:59:57,348
Okay.

818
00:59:57,396 --> 01:00:01,100
You need to stop letting
people walk all over you.

819
01:00:01,220 --> 01:00:05,812
Tonight, you are the aggressor, okay?

820
01:00:11,120 --> 01:00:13,721
Do you trust me?

821
01:00:15,871 --> 01:00:17,871
Yeah.

822
01:00:24,021 --> 01:00:26,422
<i>This is why I want to die.</i>

823
01:00:26,687 --> 01:00:29,903
I wanna have our babies
right here on this couch.

824
01:00:30,821 --> 01:00:34,468
Don't want our babies
to die on this couch.

825
01:00:34,972 --> 01:00:38,657
I want this couch covered
with our then babies.

826
01:00:40,146 --> 01:00:43,229
- Who is this?
- Doesn't he have a key?

827
01:00:43,364 --> 01:00:45,805
- Yeah, I didn't give him the key.
- Why not?

828
01:00:45,939 --> 01:00:48,805
Wait right here.

829
01:00:56,755 --> 01:01:01,972
- What about Mr Dirty Santoz, huh?
- What are you doing here, Rach?

830
01:01:03,556 --> 01:01:06,186
- Okay, where is he?
- I don't know.

831
01:01:06,306 --> 01:01:11,261
- Maybe he's with that stripper!
- The girl from the photo she's a stripper?

832
01:01:11,473 --> 01:01:15,069
Ah yes, she's a stripper but it
sounds we think she's Yoda.

833
01:01:15,289 --> 01:01:18,089
Is Yoda?
What the fuck are you talking about?

834
01:01:18,556 --> 01:01:21,731
Okay.
Where is the strip club?

835
01:01:22,457 --> 01:01:25,336
- I don't know.
- Where is the strip club?

836
01:01:25,624 --> 01:01:28,810
Tighten.
Do it bitch!

837
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:36,105
Okay now. Pretend I'm your boss. This is
your chance to finally get back at him.

838
01:01:36,224 --> 01:01:39,003
Dear Kelly, I'd really appreciate it,

839
01:01:39,004 --> 01:01:41,634
if you were nicer to me at work!
Thank you very much.

840
01:01:41,669 --> 01:01:45,735
Screw you, Abrams!  Okay.
You're an moron!

841
01:01:46,957 --> 01:01:50,240
- Don't you want to whip me now?
- Ah, right.

842
01:01:51,358 --> 01:01:54,860
Yeah, it's just that's not...
that's not really how she talks.

843
01:01:54,866 --> 01:01:57,374
Actually she... she usually like...

844
01:01:57,675 --> 01:02:01,019
usually she pretends likes I'm having
an emotional breakdown, you know...

845
01:02:01,075 --> 01:02:02,128
What's the matter?

846
01:02:02,408 --> 01:02:08,138
Well, are you leaking from your eyes
just a little baby going to cry?

847
01:02:08,258 --> 01:02:11,415
Yeah, yes, sort of like that,
but she taunts me, okay.

848
01:02:11,416 --> 01:02:14,027
She taunts me with like
feminine hygiene products.

849
01:02:14,062 --> 01:02:17,839
Do you need a maxi pad?
Do you need a sanitary napkin?

850
01:02:17,858 --> 01:02:23,125
Yeah, but that's not the term she uses.
- You need a fresh tampon for you...

851
01:02:31,668 --> 01:02:34,467
Three whiskey sours.

852
01:02:35,207 --> 01:02:38,806
- Excuse me. Sorry Julia around?
- Why?  You want to lap dance?

853
01:02:38,927 --> 01:02:41,326
- No, uh...
- Five bucks for breast massage.

854
01:02:41,447 --> 01:02:44,164
Ten for fingers banging
and fifteen for clit play.

855
01:02:44,497 --> 01:02:49,815
Clit. No!  Would you mind if
I had Julia's address, please?

856
01:02:53,194 --> 01:02:56,844
Gary is clearly making
personal calls on company time.

857
01:02:56,943 --> 01:03:01,637
You're mean Kelly!  Kelly, you're
a mean bully and I don't like you.

858
01:03:02,144 --> 01:03:05,143
Okay, now.
Pretend I'm Rachel.

859
01:03:05,378 --> 01:03:09,666
Rach, it's not fair that I'm not allowed
to have dairy products in the home

860
01:03:09,686 --> 01:03:13,066
just because you are lactose intolerance.
How is that fair?  I like yogurt!

861
01:03:13,086 --> 01:03:17,479
Do you think you could maybe dig a
little deeper?  Didn't this all hurt you?

862
01:03:17,514 --> 01:03:19,513
Yeah, she hurt me
but it wasn't her fault.

863
01:03:19,514 --> 01:03:21,526
Don't tell me, tell Rachel.

864
01:03:21,978 --> 01:03:24,271
Rach's, it's not your fault that

865
01:03:24,272 --> 01:03:27,668
you didn't develop romantic feelings
for me all those years.

866
01:03:27,729 --> 01:03:29,138
Now I knew you cared about me.

867
01:03:29,139 --> 01:03:32,748
Just not the way that I cared about you.
It's not your fault.

868
01:03:33,020 --> 01:03:36,948
I chose to stay in your life,
you know, and be with you ...

869
01:03:37,188 --> 01:03:41,994
Everyone I ever slept with, cut me loose.
Never talked to me again.

870
01:03:43,971 --> 01:03:46,551
After a while, you...

871
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:53,837
start to think that maybe
you're... unlovable, I guess.

872
01:03:53,879 --> 01:03:57,507
But you never bailed.  Rach, you
never bailed in all those years.

873
01:03:58,562 --> 01:04:01,557
That's gotta mean something, right?
I mean, that's gotta...

874
01:04:02,338 --> 01:04:06,229
And so naturally, I figured,
you must be the one.

875
01:04:07,530 --> 01:04:10,331
Until sex entered the picture.

876
01:04:11,338 --> 01:04:17,313
- You're just like all the other girls...
- Well, I guess you're wrong about me.

877
01:04:17,781 --> 01:04:19,097
Cause I'm not the one.

878
01:04:19,098 --> 01:04:23,650
Shouldn't stop me from stringing
you along all these years, right?

879
01:04:23,685 --> 01:04:25,736
No, no no.  Don't say
that. That's not true.

880
01:04:25,956 --> 01:04:30,222
Didn't I know that you're actually
in love with me that whole time?

881
01:04:30,362 --> 01:04:33,168
Yeah, you knew but
what we suppose to do?

882
01:04:33,288 --> 01:04:36,989
And it must have known that it was
hard for you and that it's painful.

883
01:04:37,141 --> 01:04:40,784
And I suppose you didn't
have to share every detail

884
01:04:40,785 --> 01:04:42,730
about every one of your boyfriends
with me all those years.

885
01:04:42,731 --> 01:04:45,516
- I guess that wasn't necessary.
- I did, didn't I?

886
01:04:45,636 --> 01:04:49,199
And even though I knew it
was really torturous for you.

887
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:51,365
You mean, like in 11th grade,
we're on a camping trip.

888
01:04:51,548 --> 01:04:53,677
You know when there're
almost raccoons everywhere

889
01:04:53,678 --> 01:04:55,676
and we were sharing
a tent together and...

890
01:04:55,711 --> 01:04:59,566
you met that guy with the goatee who
was playing guitar on the next campsite.

891
01:04:59,686 --> 01:05:01,960
You didn't have sex with the guy

892
01:05:01,961 --> 01:05:04,649
when I was lying right there
sleeping next to you in the tent.

893
01:05:04,707 --> 01:05:06,892
Especially considering you knew
that I was scared of raccoons

894
01:05:06,893 --> 01:05:09,508
and that I can't sleep
when I'm anxious!

895
01:05:17,141 --> 01:05:18,679
Thanks.

896
01:05:18,699 --> 01:05:21,799
And then Trevor dumps you.
Trevor dumps you last year, right?

897
01:05:21,823 --> 01:05:25,185
And you're feeling all like, bad about
yourself, and all heartbroken.

898
01:05:25,186 --> 01:05:26,186
So, where did you go?

899
01:05:26,283 --> 01:05:29,496
Good old Jordan. Good old Jordan.
He'll always be there.  You know.

900
01:05:29,516 --> 01:05:32,466
To use and take advantage of...

901
01:05:32,692 --> 01:05:36,566
No matter how many
times you break his heart!

902
01:05:38,775 --> 01:05:43,039
You selfish bitch!

903
01:05:43,259 --> 01:05:45,883
You never listen to me!

904
01:05:46,150 --> 01:05:48,950
You'll listen now!
Listen!

905
01:05:50,500 --> 01:05:53,507
Are you ready to listen to this?
Listen to this!

906
01:05:54,734 --> 01:05:57,931
I can't believe that I convinced
myself that you actually love me.

907
01:05:58,050 --> 01:06:00,714
You are incapable of love, Rachel!

908
01:06:00,735 --> 01:06:06,472
And when you are old, and alone
and fat and surrounded by cats

909
01:06:06,593 --> 01:06:08,205
you're gonna realize
what a mistake you've made

910
01:06:08,206 --> 01:06:10,388
what a massive mistake you've
made pushing me out of your life.

911
01:06:10,423 --> 01:06:12,956
Just because you didn't
like the way that I did it.

912
01:06:13,076 --> 01:06:16,365
Because no other guys are going to
put up with your crazy selfish bullshit,

913
01:06:16,366 --> 01:06:18,669
you insensitive cunt!

914
01:06:36,319 --> 01:06:38,319
Hey, Rach.

915
01:06:38,736 --> 01:06:40,737
Rachel!

916
01:06:42,086 --> 01:06:44,629
Rach!

917
01:06:54,331 --> 01:06:56,399
Wait!
Where are you going?

918
01:06:56,520 --> 01:06:59,383
This is the most romantic
thing you've ever done!

919
01:06:59,403 --> 01:07:02,260
How could you? Do you really
think those things about me?

920
01:07:02,261 --> 01:07:06,738
- You called me a cunt!
- No, I've been working on my dirty talk!

921
01:07:07,203 --> 01:07:10,087
I asked you a question.
Is that how you really feel?

922
01:07:10,088 --> 01:07:12,383
I need to know the truth right now.

923
01:07:12,946 --> 01:07:15,403
No! No!
It was just an exercise!

924
01:07:15,404 --> 01:07:17,840
Oh it's an exercise.
Yeah! An exercise in what?

925
01:07:27,129 --> 01:07:29,728
I'm doing this all
for you, Rachel. For us.

926
01:07:29,821 --> 01:07:32,120
- Dressing up like a woman!
- Shut up!

927
01:07:35,030 --> 01:07:37,788
So you didn't mean it?

928
01:07:38,779 --> 01:07:41,018
Selfish bitch thing.
Insensitive ...

929
01:07:41,039 --> 01:07:43,814
- Cunt, the part of me being fat!
- God, no!  No!

930
01:07:43,839 --> 01:07:48,529
I didn't mean any of that.
All I ever wanted is you, Rach.

931
01:07:52,489 --> 01:07:56,322
I need you.
Without you I am lost.

932
01:07:58,190 --> 01:08:01,806
- You are? Do you mean it?
- Yeah.

933
01:08:05,265 --> 01:08:06,807
Can we just go?

934
01:08:07,108 --> 01:08:11,068
Yes, let's just go!
Let's get out of here!

935
01:08:11,448 --> 01:08:14,703
Come on!  Wait! I just gonna
run upstairs and untie Julia, ok.

936
01:08:14,823 --> 01:08:18,727
Wait!  No!
Forget about her.  Let's go!

937
01:08:19,156 --> 01:08:23,162
Yeah!  She's bound and gagged, right.
So I'm just gonna run about 30 seconds.

938
01:08:23,282 --> 01:08:25,681
No, wait!
I'm serious!

939
01:08:27,116 --> 01:08:29,516
It's her or me.

940
01:08:30,741 --> 01:08:35,028
Are you saying that if I go upstairs
to untie my friend for like 30 seconds

941
01:08:35,063 --> 01:08:38,426
that you're going like
break up with me forever?

942
01:08:41,432 --> 01:08:43,432
Yeah.

943
01:08:43,991 --> 01:08:46,568
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
You're right.  Yeah.

944
01:08:47,782 --> 01:08:50,182
Yeah, you have to choose.

945
01:08:50,867 --> 01:08:54,090
Come on!
This week has been awful.

946
01:08:55,450 --> 01:08:59,041
You're my best friend.
You are my anchor.

947
01:09:01,492 --> 01:09:06,112
Fine, you're right, okay.
I made a mistake.

948
01:09:06,342 --> 01:09:09,591
So ... come on!

949
01:09:10,275 --> 01:09:12,688
Let's go home!

950
01:09:15,576 --> 01:09:19,780
I can't do that.  I'm not going to
leave her up there.  So... I won't.

951
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:22,939
I hope that you'll be here in
30 seconds when I get back.

952
01:09:22,940 --> 01:09:24,876
You little fucker.

953
01:09:24,911 --> 01:09:28,989
You did mean those things.
I know, my God!  I knew you did.

954
01:09:29,009 --> 01:09:33,196
- Fuck you!  Fuck you!
- Fine!  So fuck you!

955
01:09:33,243 --> 01:09:37,514
Oh! Fuck you harder.
You even know... fuck you!

956
01:09:38,227 --> 01:09:41,450
You fucking motherfucker.
I'll fucking fuck you!

957
01:09:41,869 --> 01:09:47,257
You are fucking fuck!
...Fuck you?

958
01:09:47,477 --> 01:09:51,057
Hey!  You know what? Fuck you
you foxtress. You fucking foxtress!

959
01:09:51,077 --> 01:09:54,976
Go fuck yourself! You don't know how to
fuck anything, you fucking fuck fucker!

960
01:09:55,135 --> 01:09:59,190
- You fuck so bad!
- Fuck yourself, you fuck!

961
01:09:59,310 --> 01:10:01,507
- Fuck you!
- Fuck... you!

962
01:10:01,527 --> 01:10:07,009
Wait!  Wait!  I didn't mean it.
Wait!  I didn't mean it.  Wait...

963
01:10:16,699 --> 01:10:18,986
You're a fucking bitch!

964
01:10:26,162 --> 01:10:28,161
Hey, what's happening?

965
01:10:39,671 --> 01:10:41,871
Where were you?

966
01:10:43,521 --> 01:10:47,160
They came and they took everything.
How can they do that?

967
01:10:47,279 --> 01:10:49,906
- They took it all!
- They got a writ of seizure, okay.

968
01:10:49,941 --> 01:10:51,853
It should have taken them months.
I don't know how they got it so quickly.

969
01:10:51,854 --> 01:10:53,042
But they got one.
They got one.

970
01:10:53,046 --> 01:10:56,377
So that means they can just...
Wait!  Where are you going?

971
01:10:56,496 --> 01:10:59,703
- I'm going after Rachel!
- You said you'll take care this.

972
01:10:59,723 --> 01:11:02,501
Did you even read all their mail?

973
01:11:02,502 --> 01:11:05,078
That's not fair.  You can't
blame this on me, okay.

974
01:11:05,093 --> 01:11:08,402
It's not my fault that you rented
everything from some guy named Skeet

975
01:11:08,422 --> 01:11:10,087
and then you stopped paying them.

976
01:11:10,088 --> 01:11:12,893
But I asked you.
You told me not to worry!

977
01:11:12,943 --> 01:11:16,376
You told me from now everything,
except for my restaurant...

978
01:11:16,377 --> 01:11:19,210
I can get this of...
How can I else go on?

979
01:11:19,219 --> 01:11:22,363
I just told Rachel...
I said fuck you and sent her away...

980
01:11:22,580 --> 01:11:25,655
If I don't go after her, I'm gonna lose
her, ok.  I'm gonna lose her forever.

981
01:11:25,690 --> 01:11:28,305
So I'm sorry, if I can't help you
anymore with your little restaurant.

982
01:11:28,306 --> 01:11:30,859
I got to go.
Fuck!

983
01:11:34,414 --> 01:11:36,271
<i>I checked this morning and
they said there was a delay.</i>

984
01:11:36,272 --> 01:11:38,421
<i>I just checked now and
they said it was on time.</i>

985
01:11:38,798 --> 01:11:42,257
<i>So what is it?
Well, is it delayed or is it on time?</i>

986
01:11:42,399 --> 01:11:44,183
<i>Please, I'm trying to get
on a flight since last night.</i>

987
01:11:44,184 --> 01:11:45,897
<i>I'm on my way to
the airport right now.</i>

988
01:11:48,714 --> 01:11:51,962
Hold on a second.  Hey, can
you pull over right here, please!

989
01:11:56,374 --> 01:11:58,879
Hey just a...
Please wait here for 1 minute, please.

990
01:11:58,899 --> 01:12:02,081
Yeah man, no problem.
I live to serve you.

991
01:12:12,900 --> 01:12:15,766
Hey, are you still there?
Yeah, sorry about that.

992
01:12:15,900 --> 01:12:19,749
I... on second thought I would like
to get on that 3.30 flight instead.

993
01:12:24,941 --> 01:12:26,496
Thank you.

994
01:12:26,517 --> 01:12:27,420
Here.  Do me a favour.

995
01:12:27,421 --> 01:12:30,380
Would you please make sure that
she gets this when she comes in.

996
01:12:30,381 --> 01:12:32,133
Thank you very much.

997
01:12:48,376 --> 01:12:51,381
- You gonna be okay, Jules.
- Yeah.

998
01:12:53,359 --> 01:12:56,626
- How do you know?
- I've seen you dance.

999
01:12:57,526 --> 01:13:00,327
You're an amazing dancer.

1000
01:13:00,459 --> 01:13:03,524
- Best stripper I've ever seen!
- Yeah.

1001
01:13:13,585 --> 01:13:16,231
Hey, I got but one bag...

1002
01:13:17,785 --> 01:13:21,757
I thought my co-signer had to
know me a minimum of 5 years.

1003
01:13:21,878 --> 01:13:25,160
- Yeah, I lied.
- An accountant lying to the bank?

1004
01:13:25,435 --> 01:13:28,336
Yeah, that's currently what we do.

1005
01:13:29,053 --> 01:13:32,270
But you were right about Skeet, ok.
I didn't open all those notices.

1006
01:13:32,293 --> 01:13:37,393
If I had, I could have, you know,
appealed them.  So I co-signed your loan.

1007
01:13:38,013 --> 01:13:40,366
And you're good to go, right.

1008
01:13:40,574 --> 01:13:43,656
Oh!  Don't worry, okay,
because legally Skeet

1009
01:13:43,660 --> 01:13:46,510
he only have the right to take back his
furniture, not all your restaurant stuff.

1010
01:13:46,533 --> 01:13:48,837
So, you know, you can just use
the rest of the loan money

1011
01:13:48,838 --> 01:13:50,919
to get yourself a lawyer
and get all that back.

1012
01:13:53,461 --> 01:13:56,040
Okay.
Thanks.

1013
01:13:56,837 --> 01:13:58,918
Wait wait wait.
Wait, I...

1014
01:14:00,379 --> 01:14:02,779
I know that I owe you a...

1015
01:14:03,587 --> 01:14:06,836
Last night, I was a classic dick!
Okay, I was a dick!

1016
01:14:07,421 --> 01:14:11,427
I know that.  I knew it then too.
I almost came back inside. It's just...

1017
01:14:13,796 --> 01:14:20,295
I couldn't because I... was embarrassed.
I could not look you in the eye.

1018
01:14:20,920 --> 01:14:24,543
I don't deserve a friend like
you, Julia.  I really don't.

1019
01:14:26,338 --> 01:14:32,154
I failed you.  Old wise
green pointy haired one.

1020
01:14:36,138 --> 01:14:39,218
- So you going after her, huh?
- Yup.

1021
01:14:39,339 --> 01:14:42,802
- Can't learn it from a book, dumb-ass.
- What?

1022
01:14:44,839 --> 01:14:46,883
Yeah, well, I couldn't
exactly have her

1023
01:14:46,884 --> 01:14:49,835
falling asleep during
make-up sex now, could I?

1024
01:14:53,306 --> 01:14:55,706
Do you have any fruit?

1025
01:15:03,257 --> 01:15:06,656
Here rule number 1.
Don't worry about your hair.

1026
01:15:06,740 --> 01:15:10,703
- Okay, let's see what you got.
- Okay.

1027
01:15:11,089 --> 01:15:15,097
Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Slow down.
No.  Don't just pounce.

1028
01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:20,482
Introduce yourself.  Slowly.
Just with you breath at first.

1029
01:15:21,382 --> 01:15:25,001
And then, very gently ...
No, not a blow. Lick more of her.

1030
01:15:26,907 --> 01:15:29,512
Like when you steam up
a window, you know, and then...

1031
01:15:30,298 --> 01:15:33,543
Yeah, and then very
gently with your tongue ...

1032
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:37,072
No!  Gently.
Almost imperceptibly. Yeah.

1033
01:15:38,883 --> 01:15:40,883
Okay, yeah, that's right.

1034
01:15:42,341 --> 01:15:44,341
Yeah...

1035
01:15:44,491 --> 01:15:48,763
- Is that good?  Am I doing that right?
- Rule number 2: No talking.

1036
01:15:48,783 --> 01:15:50,783
Okay.

1037
01:15:52,924 --> 01:15:57,307
Okay, whatever you just did right
there, don't ever do that again.

1038
01:15:57,340 --> 01:15:58,256
Now...

1039
01:15:58,658 --> 01:16:02,040
try long strokes, bottom to top.

1040
01:16:02,175 --> 01:16:04,854
Consistent pressure.

1041
01:16:06,075 --> 01:16:09,629
Okay, and when you sense
that the cantaloupe is ready,

1042
01:16:09,630 --> 01:16:12,440
that means it's clitoris time.

1043
01:16:12,976 --> 01:16:15,757
- You do know what that is, right?
- Mm hm.

1044
01:16:15,878 --> 01:16:18,676
Up, up.  Yeah, okay.

1045
01:16:22,635 --> 01:16:25,015
That actually looks pretty good.

1046
01:16:26,343 --> 01:16:28,943
Okay, work the sides.
The sides.

1047
01:16:29,093 --> 01:16:32,759
Hold off on direct contact.
Just flirt, tease.

1048
01:16:34,586 --> 01:16:38,467
Whoa whoa, no no no! No sucking!
It's not a Jolly Rancher.

1049
01:16:38,801 --> 01:16:42,620
Go back to what you were
doing before!  Gentle pressure.

1050
01:16:43,136 --> 01:16:45,135
Yeah.

1051
01:16:48,135 --> 01:16:51,763
Okay.
Yeah, that's...

1052
01:16:52,761 --> 01:16:55,242
Yeah, you got it.

1053
01:16:58,761 --> 01:17:03,395
You know, if you wanted to
I suppose you could...

1054
01:17:03,587 --> 01:17:06,300
Really?
You'll be cool with that?

1055
01:17:06,303 --> 01:17:10,633
- I mean because I think that might really...
- Help with the lesson? Yeah! Me too.

1056
01:17:11,552 --> 01:17:13,039
- Okay?
- Okay, yeah.

1057
01:17:22,178 --> 01:17:27,398
- I really appreciate this. You know I...
- Instructional.  Yeah, of course!

1058
01:17:33,638 --> 01:17:35,637
Oh, yes!

1059
01:17:36,679 --> 01:17:38,945
Yes, that's very good.

1060
01:17:43,638 --> 01:17:46,237
Okay now, increase the pressure.

1061
01:17:47,029 --> 01:17:50,998
Yeah! Okay don't stop doing that!

1062
01:17:51,117 --> 01:17:53,176
- Keep doing!
- Should I just flip my tongue...?

1063
01:17:53,196 --> 01:17:56,929
Rule number two!
Jesus! Oh!

1064
01:17:58,513 --> 01:18:01,332
Okay, yeah, you're a natural.

1065
01:18:01,514 --> 01:18:03,514
Yup.

1066
01:18:11,097 --> 01:18:13,097
Yeah! Oh fuck!

1067
01:18:13,764 --> 01:18:16,737
- Did you come?
- Oh! I burn!

1068
01:18:16,857 --> 01:18:18,379
- What did I do? What did I do?
- Are you chewing gum?

1069
01:18:18,380 --> 01:18:22,029
What? No!  I.. I.. Yes!
I wanted to have fresh breath.

1070
01:18:22,030 --> 01:18:23,230
On my vagina?

1071
01:18:23,247 --> 01:18:25,463
Sorry!  I was nervous!
What's going on?

1072
01:18:25,464 --> 01:18:26,420
Don't you know
I'm allergic to mint?

1073
01:18:26,422 --> 01:18:30,310
Allergic to mint?  Sorry!
Here.. here some water.

1074
01:18:32,176 --> 01:18:34,712
- Shower!  Shower!
- That way! That way!

1075
01:18:48,809 --> 01:18:52,015
- Are you all right? Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

1076
01:18:52,174 --> 01:18:54,173
You feel better?

1077
01:18:54,473 --> 01:18:57,307
I think you can kiss me.

1078
01:19:37,767 --> 01:19:39,767
Excuse me.

1079
01:19:47,476 --> 01:19:50,506
- Hey! ...?
- Sorry!

1080
01:19:50,726 --> 01:19:52,925
Come here!

1081
01:19:53,118 --> 01:19:56,548
What the hell are you doing up here?
Reshma wants to call the police!

1082
01:19:56,668 --> 01:20:00,250
Sorry something just happened
in the bathroom, with Julia.

1083
01:20:00,296 --> 01:20:02,218
Julia?  I thought Rachel
who came back for you.

1084
01:20:02,219 --> 01:20:03,500
I thought you and she
were getting back together.

1085
01:20:03,507 --> 01:20:04,449
No no, she's gone.
She left.

1086
01:20:04,450 --> 01:20:06,350
Oh, for fuck sake.
How did you fuck that up?

1087
01:20:06,351 --> 01:20:07,380
It's a long story, okay.

1088
01:20:07,385 --> 01:20:09,927
Julia thought it was a good
idea if I tied her up and...

1089
01:20:09,928 --> 01:20:11,533
You know what?  It doesn't look...
Why does it even matter?

1090
01:20:11,534 --> 01:20:12,855
You don't even want me to be
with Rachel in the first place.

1091
01:20:12,856 --> 01:20:15,486
Yes, I know, I know.
I said that. I just...

1092
01:20:15,735 --> 01:20:18,014
You know, I'm realizing
something here.

1093
01:20:18,135 --> 01:20:21,711
You and Rachel have weathered storms
together.  That's really important.

1094
01:20:21,846 --> 01:20:26,243
This shit is just one more storm. Granted,
honestly, it seems like a giant hurricane.

1095
01:20:26,377 --> 01:20:29,774
But, I was in New Orleans in
February and it looks fine to me.

1096
01:20:29,894 --> 01:20:32,650
It sounds very insensitive.
When people of Louisiana wants to ...

1097
01:20:32,651 --> 01:20:34,321
Wait! I've gone through a lot.
Just stop for a second!

1098
01:20:34,352 --> 01:20:37,498
- Julia and I just had this moment...
- No, stop saying Julia! Stop saying Julia.

1099
01:20:37,618 --> 01:20:39,134
Julia is field cricket.
She's not for you

1100
01:20:39,135 --> 01:20:41,445
You have got to go
and get Rachel back.

1101
01:20:42,961 --> 01:20:45,561
You can't come in.

1102
01:20:45,836 --> 01:20:49,686
There is clearly
something going on in here.

1103
01:20:51,395 --> 01:20:54,396
And it's something that I never ...

1104
01:21:00,786 --> 01:21:04,058
You just have to tell me that you
feel it too and then I will let you in.

1105
01:21:04,062 --> 01:21:07,682
<i>No, we need to pee.</i>

1106
01:21:15,562 --> 01:21:17,859
- Sorry.
- No, it's alright.

1107
01:21:17,979 --> 01:21:20,980
- Julia.
- Yeah, Dandak.

1108
01:21:56,273 --> 01:21:59,273
Rach.

1109
01:22:02,773 --> 01:22:06,231
I'm sorry, Rach.
Sorry.

1110
01:22:07,340 --> 01:22:10,432
Too late.
Go away!

1111
01:22:15,315 --> 01:22:18,944
I really want to make things right.

1112
01:22:19,065 --> 01:22:21,064
I would like to ...

1113
01:22:22,007 --> 01:22:24,407
<i>I love you, Rachel.</i>

1114
01:22:24,690 --> 01:22:28,522
Those things you said, you were so mean.
That you don't love me.

1115
01:22:28,657 --> 01:22:31,299
<i>You never loved me!</i>

1116
01:22:45,391 --> 01:22:49,357
That's the receipt in the first time
we ever went for coffee together.

1117
01:22:49,775 --> 01:22:52,524
<i>January 5, 1989.</i>

1118
01:22:53,025 --> 01:22:57,895
You had the peppermint cocoa.
I had a herbal tea.

1119
01:23:08,025 --> 01:23:11,877
"Dear Jordan, you make me smile.

1120
01:23:12,551 --> 01:23:15,195
Thank you for being my friend.

1121
01:23:15,317 --> 01:23:20,581
<i>You slipped that in my side textbook,
the day after your parents got divorced.</i>

1122
01:23:20,801 --> 01:23:22,801
<i>Remember?</i>

1123
01:23:23,010 --> 01:23:25,809
And you laughed.

1124
01:23:35,193 --> 01:23:40,607
You remember in third year
you borrowed my dorm room

1125
01:23:40,835 --> 01:23:46,636
so you could have sex with with
that jockey guy in the army shirt?

1126
01:23:48,735 --> 01:23:49,772
Why did you keep that?

1127
01:23:49,773 --> 01:23:52,443
You woke up the next
morning and he was gone.

1128
01:23:52,903 --> 01:23:58,783
You cried in my arms for two days
straight.  Just crying in my arms.

1129
01:24:06,036 --> 01:24:08,436
That's totally fucked up.

1130
01:24:08,611 --> 01:24:12,859
Just weird, sad, pathetic, it's twisted.

1131
01:24:13,278 --> 01:24:16,100
It's creepy.
That's really really creepy.

1132
01:24:18,278 --> 01:24:20,678
And it's sweet.

1133
01:24:25,570 --> 01:24:30,450
- While they were gone, I had sex.
- Yeah, I kind of figured. That's ok.

1134
01:24:30,470 --> 01:24:33,670
With so many people.

1135
01:24:37,579 --> 01:24:40,179
Are you ready?

1136
01:24:58,196 --> 01:25:02,614
- Back in bed, lover-boy!
- Goodness!

1137
01:25:02,780 --> 01:25:06,361
- Oh wow, thank you!
- You're welcome.

1138
01:25:06,496 --> 01:25:09,135
- Have a raspberry.
- I will.

1139
01:25:12,989 --> 01:25:15,388
Hang on a second here.

1140
01:25:17,480 --> 01:25:21,611
Where did you find it?
When?  How this is ...

1141
01:25:21,639 --> 01:25:24,607
Yes! Yes!
Let's get married!

1142
01:25:26,022 --> 01:25:29,895
The engagement party is tonight.
I've been on the phone all morning

1143
01:25:30,014 --> 01:25:32,560
and almost everyone's confirmed.

1144
01:25:32,765 --> 01:25:35,603
- I love you!
- Oh my God.

1145
01:25:35,723 --> 01:25:38,547
- I love you!
- I love you!

1146
01:25:39,198 --> 01:25:42,197
- And I want more ...
- Okay!

1147
01:25:43,390 --> 01:25:44,784
- Ok, that's good.
- I'm gonna go up.

1148
01:25:44,785 --> 01:25:46,885
No, that's good! That's good!
Yeah, that's good.

1149
01:26:19,050 --> 01:26:22,714
All these years slipping birth
control pills into you coffee,

1150
01:26:22,833 --> 01:26:26,321
circulating memos about your
gender reassignment surgery

1151
01:26:26,341 --> 01:26:30,232
I had no idea it was
actually true, Jordana.

1152
01:26:31,167 --> 01:26:35,655
See what I did there?
Feminize your name by adding an "A".

1153
01:26:37,994 --> 01:26:42,002
Look.  I don't care if you're gay,
bisexual or tritestical, whatever.

1154
01:26:42,003 --> 01:26:43,835
You still get the same work load.

1155
01:26:43,934 --> 01:26:45,086
Now that you see me as a woman,

1156
01:26:45,087 --> 01:26:49,008
you're actually more attracted
to me than you were before this.

1157
01:26:50,359 --> 01:26:53,160
That must be so confusing for you.

1158
01:26:53,185 --> 01:26:56,085
I'm not attracted to you.

1159
01:27:06,051 --> 01:27:09,052
The ring is beautiful!

1160
01:27:13,751 --> 01:27:16,334
How is anyone expected to eat
a piece of cheesecake this size.

1161
01:27:16,335 --> 01:27:18,493
It's way too big.
Get me your supervisor.

1162
01:27:19,501 --> 01:27:22,504
- Mom.  Mom!
- Hurry. Quicker!

1163
01:27:22,936 --> 01:27:26,836
Can you keep fussing with that?
Don't make me resort to the safety pins.

1164
01:27:26,861 --> 01:27:30,791
- You remember the safety pins?
- I remember it!

1165
01:27:39,336 --> 01:27:44,571
Oh, no!  Did you eat something like kiwi?
Okay, good.  Stop, stop.  Calm down!

1166
01:27:45,369 --> 01:27:49,367
Alright, this is your little speech.
You'll do fine.

1167
01:27:49,645 --> 01:27:53,077
Just say lovely things about me.
Right?

1168
01:27:55,437 --> 01:28:00,052
Listen up, folks!
It's speech time.

1169
01:28:00,229 --> 01:28:06,304
Everybody knows me as impulsive, fly by
the sea to my parents kind of gal. Right?

1170
01:28:07,140 --> 01:28:11,740
But marrying this guy is hardly
impulsive.  It's just plain smart.

1171
01:28:20,354 --> 01:28:24,358
Ladies and gentlemen, family and
friends.  Friedrich Nietzsche said:

1172
01:28:24,388 --> 01:28:28,488
"The best friend is likely
to acquire the best wife

1173
01:28:28,688 --> 01:28:32,689
because a good marriage is
based on a talent for friendship."

1174
01:28:38,247 --> 01:28:44,397
Rachel and I are have been friends,
best friends since we were 12.  So...

1175
01:28:53,395 --> 01:28:57,428
I think Nietzsche must have
married his best friend.

1176
01:28:57,447 --> 01:29:02,605
Two.  I also believed he got
syphilis and he went crazy.

1177
01:29:09,706 --> 01:29:13,939
I'm just choking! It's choking!
I'm choking. I'm choking!

1178
01:29:18,590 --> 01:29:22,010
Hello, I know you all saw
me on the national news.

1179
01:29:22,032 --> 01:29:26,146
I was wearing pink thong and being
sexually assaulted by a tranny blogger.

1180
01:29:26,191 --> 01:29:29,973
So, so weird that we're
not talking about it, right?

1181
01:29:30,107 --> 01:29:33,950
He's just dehydrated.  Low blood
sugar.  Could we get some nuts!

1182
01:29:33,970 --> 01:29:38,939
No, Mom!  It's not time now.
It's honesty time now. Okay.

1183
01:29:39,466 --> 01:29:43,954
Here it is.  So Rachel doesn't really
want to marry me.  She never did.

1184
01:29:44,525 --> 01:29:48,455
She's confused because
yesterday I did this thing

1185
01:29:48,511 --> 01:29:54,311
to the upper left quadrant of her
clitoris, which sounds she had an orgasm.

1186
01:29:54,336 --> 01:29:57,428
She actually hasn't have
one, it's been like a year.

1187
01:29:57,429 --> 01:30:02,147
There hasn't been any of that since
she falls asleep every time we have sex.

1188
01:30:02,244 --> 01:30:06,364
Yeah, I know that sounds like crazy,
but I thought she had a bit of narcolepsy.

1189
01:30:06,365 --> 01:30:08,194
Let me explain, okay.

1190
01:30:08,625 --> 01:30:12,600
Rachel came to get me in Toronto and
I always thought that was really romantic,

1191
01:30:12,633 --> 01:30:16,282
but then I'm kind of realizing
that actually she wasn't...

1192
01:30:16,357 --> 01:30:21,299
she was feeling lonely and sort of
sad and insecure, and I get that.

1193
01:30:21,326 --> 01:30:23,387
I mean she gets like that
sometimes and we talked.

1194
01:30:23,388 --> 01:30:25,857
We talked that out.
I've always been there for her.

1195
01:30:25,918 --> 01:30:27,635
But the problem is, is that,

1196
01:30:27,736 --> 01:30:31,540
this isn't where you want
to start from for a marriage

1197
01:30:31,575 --> 01:30:34,176
and I know that she
doesn't really want to.

1198
01:30:35,559 --> 01:30:40,380
Rachel, I'm really sorry.
So, in conclusion ...

1199
01:30:41,652 --> 01:30:44,857
I'm out of here.
Thank you.  Good night.

1200
01:30:54,528 --> 01:30:58,519
Ahh it's so wild.
How funny a book club.

1201
01:30:58,695 --> 01:31:02,814
Tell your grandparents
I can't wait to meet them.

1202
01:31:05,053 --> 01:31:07,052
Goodbye.

1203
01:31:07,527 --> 01:31:10,825
- Excuse me, excuse me.
- Dude. Well, you're back?

1204
01:31:10,945 --> 01:31:14,634
- Yeah, I just drop off my stuff here.
- Wait!  What the hell?

1205
01:31:14,754 --> 01:31:18,758
- I thought you were getting married?
- Yeah, but... changed plans.

1206
01:31:18,878 --> 01:31:21,416
- And so where are you going right now?
- I'm going to the Strip Club.

1207
01:31:22,017 --> 01:31:23,829
- You want to come?
- No, no I can't do that.

1208
01:31:23,830 --> 01:31:26,029
- Please, come with me!
- No I can't do that. I can't be that guy.

1209
01:31:26,064 --> 01:31:28,371
I can't go to places like that.
I can't go to a places with like...

1210
01:31:28,405 --> 01:31:32,752
dancers and music like that and
a shot of vodka to ... your soul.

1211
01:31:32,946 --> 01:31:35,892
- Can't be that guy?
- Fuck! So stupid...

1212
01:31:36,012 --> 01:31:37,642
- Give me another second.
- Yeah, I just...

1213
01:31:37,643 --> 01:31:39,595
Could you just give me 5 seconds, please?
Just want to ask you something.

1214
01:31:39,596 --> 01:31:40,845
- Is that cool?
- Yeah, of course, yeah.

1215
01:31:41,171 --> 01:31:43,701
You're in like... in a
relationship, right,

1216
01:31:43,702 --> 01:31:47,128
and with somebody that you really wanna
be in that relationship with, right?

1217
01:31:47,797 --> 01:31:52,396
And you want to give yourself
over to it... like completely, right?

1218
01:31:52,921 --> 01:31:55,722
So... like how do you do that?

1219
01:31:57,297 --> 01:32:03,130
How do you do that and
not like lose part of himself?

1220
01:32:03,863 --> 01:32:06,432
- That's stupid?
- You are seriously cute.

1221
01:32:06,553 --> 01:32:09,554
This is the sweetest thing... No!
Honestly that's the sweetest thing.

1222
01:32:09,555 --> 01:32:10,374
Just shut up and go!

1223
01:32:10,375 --> 01:32:12,531
Wait, I'll tell you the
answer to that question okay!

1224
01:32:12,532 --> 01:32:13,532
What?

1225
01:32:14,181 --> 01:32:16,215
The Strip Club is like calling

1226
01:32:16,216 --> 01:32:17,671
- out to you tonight.
- No, I'm not going to go.

1227
01:32:17,672 --> 01:32:20,995
"Dandak, Dandak
come to the Strip Club"

1228
01:32:23,613 --> 01:32:26,019
- You're an ass. You're an ass to me.
- Let it come!

1229
01:32:26,148 --> 01:32:27,644
- You're an ass.  So it's coming.
- Leave it come!

1230
01:32:27,664 --> 01:32:32,707
It's coming! It's coming! You're such an
asshole! You know what? I wanna go change.

1231
01:32:32,708 --> 01:32:37,332
Yeah!  Thank you, I could really use your
help.  Thank you.   It's gonna be good.

1232
01:32:58,175 --> 01:33:00,174
<i>Julia!</i>

1233
01:33:08,575 --> 01:33:12,360
You don't have to work here
anymore.  You got your loan now.

1234
01:33:12,800 --> 01:33:16,850
I like working here and
I rejected your stupid loan.

1235
01:33:16,866 --> 01:33:21,345
What? Why? Wait!  Can you
hold on?   I came back for you.

1236
01:33:56,535 --> 01:33:58,534
Hey!

1237
01:34:00,985 --> 01:34:03,384
- What happened to your book club?
- What?

1238
01:34:03,443 --> 01:34:06,142
What are you doing here?
What happened to your book club?

1239
01:34:10,577 --> 01:34:13,177
Can I talk to you?

1240
01:34:14,260 --> 01:34:18,101
I'm sorry okay.  I'm sorry
that I left you in the shower!

1241
01:34:18,102 --> 01:34:21,274
I just... I got terrified
and so I bailed.

1242
01:34:22,019 --> 01:34:26,302
Fellow, you need to leave now,
because our little arrangement is over.

1243
01:34:26,711 --> 01:34:29,136
Hey, just wait a second!
Please.

1244
01:34:29,171 --> 01:34:32,071
- Guys don't touch, punk!  Douche-bag.
- No, no no!

1245
01:34:32,261 --> 01:34:37,499
Hoy already threw him out once, Spike.
I don't know how he got in again.

1246
01:34:41,053 --> 01:34:43,275
- Don't do this
- Get rid of him.

1247
01:34:43,310 --> 01:34:45,152
I don't want to see
this douche-bag ever again.

1248
01:34:45,153 --> 01:34:47,845
Why am I a douche-bag
Why is everyone calling...?  Ahh..

1249
01:34:49,854 --> 01:34:51,953
Julia!

1250
01:34:56,454 --> 01:34:59,686
I enjoy promiscuity sex.

1251
01:35:00,470 --> 01:35:03,928
Reshma, I'm...
I'm a slut.

1252
01:35:05,513 --> 01:35:09,679
I've done things that are like
illegal probably in most countries.

1253
01:35:09,887 --> 01:35:18,897
I'm a dirty, dirty, dirty boy...

1254
01:35:56,140 --> 01:35:59,739
Hey, it's only noon!
You got your coat already?

1255
01:35:59,939 --> 01:36:02,940
I hope you got some guys on me.

1256
01:36:03,390 --> 01:36:07,637
- No, I'm gonna eat breakfast in bed.
- Aren't you going to the buffet?

1257
01:36:08,039 --> 01:36:11,303
It's Ham Tuesdays.
It's fucking sweet!

1258
01:36:34,399 --> 01:36:38,400
APHRODISIAC

1259
01:36:47,709 --> 01:36:50,590
Technically the grand opening
is still a couple of weeks away

1260
01:36:50,600 --> 01:36:54,614
but I couldn't wait
anymore for you to see.

1261
01:36:55,167 --> 01:36:56,753
You stole my idea?

1262
01:36:56,754 --> 01:36:58,534
You said you won't
gonna do anymore of this.

1263
01:36:58,599 --> 01:37:03,000
- So, finders keepers, right?
- And my stuff. You stole my stuff?

1264
01:37:03,059 --> 01:37:06,397
No no, Skeet stole your
stuff, okay.  I stole it back.

1265
01:37:06,517 --> 01:37:08,906
It's your stuff.  You can do
whatever you want with it.

1266
01:37:08,907 --> 01:37:11,162
You know, I think it looks
pretty great in here.

1267
01:37:13,976 --> 01:37:17,621
So, how have you been?

1268
01:37:18,610 --> 01:37:22,309
I've been great.
And better than ever.

1269
01:37:22,693 --> 01:37:25,959
I miss you.
I miss you and...

1270
01:37:26,394 --> 01:37:28,254
I forced myself not to call,

1271
01:37:28,255 --> 01:37:31,230
because I wanted to give
you a space and all that stuff

1272
01:37:31,234 --> 01:37:33,198
but every day I picked up that phone,

1273
01:37:33,199 --> 01:37:37,310
I did that thing where you dial the first
like six numbers and then the hover...

1274
01:37:37,345 --> 01:37:39,436
This is all wrong.

1275
01:37:39,526 --> 01:37:45,326
People need to be comfortable, they need
plush couches and it has to love seats.

1276
01:37:46,019 --> 01:37:48,418
Couches here.

1277
01:37:48,627 --> 01:37:50,815
And my tables, they need to be
refinished.  They're not finished.

1278
01:37:50,816 --> 01:37:53,684
Good idea.
Yes, absolutely you're right.

1279
01:37:57,311 --> 01:38:00,491
These colors are all wrong.  They
need to be warmer, earthy tones.

1280
01:38:00,492 --> 01:38:02,801
Yeah, hey, guys.
Hold the work, okay.

1281
01:38:02,836 --> 01:38:06,208
What's with the colour here?
What are you doing with this color?

1282
01:38:07,302 --> 01:38:11,212
- What about the menu?
- Yeah, about that I...

1283
01:38:11,663 --> 01:38:16,187
I should probably get on that cause
I haven't actually found a chef yet.

1284
01:38:18,262 --> 01:38:23,737
It's... It's yours if you want it.

1285
01:38:29,478 --> 01:38:33,728
Just let me ...
I have so much that I feel like I...

1286
01:38:34,671 --> 01:38:38,293
You know, when you can ...

1287
01:38:38,518 --> 01:38:41,191
You have a... feeling inside you ...

1288
01:38:41,354 --> 01:38:44,209
You have this like... feeling...

1289
01:38:53,588 --> 01:38:55,543
You  really really need
to work on your speech.

1290
01:38:55,544 --> 01:38:57,044
Yeah, I know ...
You see what I meant?

1291
01:38:57,192 --> 01:38:59,892
Thanks.

1292
01:39:00,864 --> 01:39:04,628
<i>- Are you nervous?
- No.  Why would I be nervous?</i>

1293
01:39:05,114 --> 01:39:08,682
<i>Well, you do have a history of putting
women to sleep when you fuck them, so...</i>

1294
01:39:08,730 --> 01:39:10,455
<i>I'm just gonna go
ahead and say it like that, </i>

1295
01:39:10,456 --> 01:39:12,695
<i>right, while I'm  lying
here naked with you.</i>

1296
01:39:13,797 --> 01:39:16,907
<i>Thank you for bringing that up.</i>

1297
01:39:18,048 --> 01:39:21,452
<i>When you're ready, you
can enter at your leisure.</i>

1298
01:39:21,472 --> 01:39:24,781
<i>I'm ready! I'm ready.
Can you help me?</i>

1299
01:39:26,648 --> 01:39:29,847
<i>Almost there. Is that... is that it?
- Yeah.</i>

1300
01:39:38,049 --> 01:39:41,848
<i>- How do you feel?
- Yeah, it feels very good.</i>

1301
01:39:44,065 --> 01:39:46,637
<i>Wait wait wait! Stop stop stop!
What are you doing?</i>

1302
01:39:46,638 --> 01:39:48,201
<i>Nothing! What do you mean?</i>

1303
01:39:48,691 --> 01:39:52,324
<i>You ...!
After ten seconds!</i>

1304
01:39:52,649 --> 01:39:56,863
<i>- Isn't that's a compliment?
- How did Rachel trying to fall asleep?</i>

1305
01:39:56,956 --> 01:40:00,508
<i>I don't know.
- How did you tackle this
issue at the Rub & Tug?</i>

1306
01:40:00,732 --> 01:40:03,076
<i>Come on. I really rather
not go there right now.</i>

1307
01:40:03,077 --> 01:40:05,290
<i>I'm good, I'm good.
I'm cool, I'm good.</i>

1308
01:40:07,357 --> 01:40:11,438
<i>- I'm calm now.
- Ok, let's move together.</i>

1309
01:40:11,541 --> 01:40:15,640
<i>- Can you change the angle?
- Oh! That feels good!</i>

1310
01:40:15,760 --> 01:40:18,204
<i>- Yeah?
- Yeah!</i>

1311
01:40:18,690 --> 01:40:21,344
<i>That does it! Yeah, okay.
- Oop, sorry.</i>

1312
01:40:22,050 --> 01:40:24,264
<i>Oh yeah!</i>

1313
01:40:26,325 --> 01:40:28,798
<i>- What... what?
- Right, I stopping...</i>

1314
01:40:28,817 --> 01:40:32,187
<i>- I'm breathing, I'm breathing!
- No, no, no!  Keep going.</i>

1315
01:40:34,400 --> 01:40:36,763
<i>I got a leg cramp!</i>

1316
01:40:36,783 --> 01:40:41,192
<i>Well, squeeze your toes, squeeze
your toes together, then relax...</i>

1317
01:40:43,409 --> 01:40:46,671
<i>Oh, that's better.</i>

1318
01:40:51,132 --> 01:40:52,451
<i>- Oh, where did it go?
- Yeah.</i>

1319
01:40:52,652 --> 01:40:55,037
<i>- Is that going to come out. Oh no no no.
- Okay.</i>

1320
01:40:55,651 --> 01:40:58,881
<i>- Sorry, it's slippery.
- This thing happens.</i>

1321
01:40:59,102 --> 01:41:03,780
<i>- Seems to be getting there! Oh, yeah!
- Oh, yeah!</i>

1322
01:41:03,815 --> 01:41:08,580
<i>I'm in zones. I'm in zones.
I can do this forever and ever.</i>

1323
01:41:10,985 --> 01:41:15,150
<i>- Are you near?
- No! No! No!</i>

1324
01:41:15,327 --> 01:41:19,132
<i>- Love it. Don't you think?
