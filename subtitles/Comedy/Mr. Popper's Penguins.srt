Hey, guys.

648

We talked to Van Gundy's people.

649

They say she turned you down flat.

Fellas, calm down. Life's too short,

651

with integrity and character.

your name off my marble slab.

667

to the Mayor's re-election fund.

1280
01:07:12,470 --> 01:07:15,180
Boy, l never get tired
of looking at New York from here.

1281
01:07:15,264 --> 01:07:16,473
l love what you've done with the place.

Popper, what are you doing here?

1283
01:07:18,601 --> 01:07:21,770
l'm on a mission of mercy, Franklin.
l decided to take you back.

1284
01:07:21,854 --> 01:07:23,813
You're taking us back? We fired you.

1285
01:07:24,231 --> 01:07:26,024
All is forgiven then, don't worry about it.

1286
01:07:26,108 --> 01:07:27,609
Let me bring you up to speed.

1287
01:07:27,693 --> 01:07:29,778
l've been playing hardball with Van Gundy.

1288
01:07:29,862 --> 01:07:31,947
l told her kids
we were offering $1 00 million.

1289
01:07:32,239 --> 01:07:36,201
l suggested they make her life difficult
until she accepts,

1290
01:07:36,494 --> 01:07:38,119
so they've all moved back home.

1291
01:07:38,204 --> 01:07:40,372
Mrs. Van Gundy has planned
a press conference for tomorrow.

1292
01:07:40,456 --> 01:07:41,957
She wants us all present.

1293
01:07:42,458 --> 01:07:43,541
lf you'll excuse us,

1294
01:07:44,043 --> 01:07:45,710
we have to unpack.

1295
01:07:47,463 --> 01:07:49,005

-Hey, Dad.
-Hi.

1298
01:07:52,551 --> 01:07:54,010
Hey, how are you feeling?

1299
01:07:54,095 --> 01:07:55,428
Yeah, Dad, are you okay?

1300
01:07:55,513 --> 01:07:56,972
Yeah, l'm fine.

1301
01:07:57,056 --> 01:07:59,224
Before you go in there,

1302
01:07:59,308 --> 01:08:02,727
l think l should tell you,
there has been a couple of changes.

1303
01:08:12,279 --> 01:08:13,279
BlLLY: Where are they?

1304
01:08:13,364 --> 01:08:15,991
They're okay, they're fine.
They're at the zoo.

1305
01:08:16,075 --> 01:08:17,993
And you know what?
lt's really the best place for them.

1306
01:08:18,244 --> 01:08:19,619
They're probably in an icy pool right now.

1307
01:08:19,704 --> 01:08:22,580
All the fish they can eat.
Full-time penguin masseuse.

1308
01:08:22,665 --> 01:08:25,041
The whole thing's being narrated
by Morgan Freeman.

1309
01:08:25,501 --> 01:08:27,127
You sent them away to some cage?

1310
01:08:27,837 --> 01:08:31,881
Billy, they're birds.
They don't feel things the way we do.

1311

-Thom, l don't think. . .
-Don't bother, Mom.

Come on, guys.

1313
01:08:35,428 --> 01:08:38,221
We had fun,
but it's time to get back to reality.

1314
01:08:38,305 --> 01:08:40,390
We got soccer.
We got the Snowball Dance.

1315
01:08:40,474 --> 01:08:43,393
l'm not going
to the stupid Snowball Dance.

1316
01:08:44,937 --> 01:08:46,271

1326
01:09:10,421 --> 01:09:12,547

That wasn't me.

1328
01:09:14,091 --> 01:09:16,468
That was a dream
where people live with penguins.

1329
01:09:16,552 --> 01:09:18,428
And their kids love them.
And all the eggs hatch.

1330
01:09:18,804 --> 01:09:20,138
So wake up!

1331
01:09:21,682 --> 01:09:22,766
Wow.

1332

1333
01:09:29,231 --> 01:09:33,818

turn it into a vacation.

But l hope there's still time for you.

Give your little ones a hug from Grandpa.
