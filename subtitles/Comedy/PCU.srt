00:00:13,381 --> 00:00:14,915
This is
our generation, man.

3
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:17,718
All you people, we're all
together, man, it's groovy.

4
00:00:17,818 --> 00:00:20,621

It's really groovy.

Oh, yeah.

31
00:04:18,892 --> 00:04:20,661
Shit. Fuse box again.

32
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:21,862
I got it last time.

33
00:04:21,962 --> 00:04:23,364
I know.

34
00:04:25,366 --> 00:04:27,368
Um...

35
00:04:27,468 --> 00:04:28,402
Excuse me.

36
00:04:28,502 --> 00:04:29,537
Excuse me.

37
00:04:29,637 --> 00:04:31,539
Is James Andrews around?

38
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:33,641
What are you, a narc?

39
00:04:33,741 --> 00:04:35,476
No, no, no.
I'm a pre-frosh.

40
00:04:35,576 --> 00:04:37,811
I'm just looking
for James Andrews.

41
00:04:40,047 --> 00:04:41,649
Heads up!

42
00:04:41,749 --> 00:04:42,983
James Andrews...

43
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:45,953
Oh, Droz. He's in
the hole, room two.

44
00:04:46,053 --> 00:04:48,622
Um...where--

45
00:04:48,722 --> 00:04:50,023
The basement.

46
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:53,494
Come on. Follow me.

47
00:05:01,502 --> 00:05:03,804
End of the hall.

48
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:11,979
Ahem.

49
00:05:13,381 --> 00:05:14,382
Go ahead.

50
00:05:14,482 --> 00:05:16,717
Last door on the left.

51
00:05:41,409 --> 00:05:42,510
Hello?

52
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:50,217
Uh...

53
00:05:50,484 --> 00:05:51,952
James?

54
00:05:54,588 --> 00:05:56,924
Uh, excuse me.

55
00:05:58,426 --> 00:06:00,093
Ooh.

56
00:06:00,428 --> 00:06:01,161
Uh...

57
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:04,465
Uh...

58
00:06:13,507 --> 00:06:14,775
Coffee.

59
00:06:15,676 --> 00:06:17,044
Coffee now!

60
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:21,148
There.

61
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:28,055
All right, what do you need,

62
00:06:28,155 --> 00:06:31,024
bottle rockets,
dental dams, reddi-whips?

63
00:06:31,124 --> 00:06:32,626
Term papers?

64
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:34,528
Um, actually,
no, no, no.

65
00:06:34,628 --> 00:06:36,797
I'm Tom Lawrence.
I'm a pre-frosh.

66
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:40,534
I'm just up here
at Port Chester

67
00:06:40,634 --> 00:06:42,536
just to see if
I want to go here.

68
00:06:42,636 --> 00:06:44,505
What am I,
a stop on the tour?

69
00:06:44,605 --> 00:06:45,573
Actually, um,

70
00:06:45,673 --> 00:06:46,974
admissions
arranged for me

71
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:50,043
to spend the night
at your frat.

72
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:52,680
Gee, Scooter, frats were
banned in the sixties.

73
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:54,314
They were?

74
00:06:54,548 --> 00:06:56,550
Let me see that.

75
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:57,885
I don't believe this.

76
00:06:57,985 --> 00:07:00,220
I've been pimped
by admissions.

77
00:07:00,488 --> 00:07:01,589
OK.

78
00:07:01,689 --> 00:07:02,790
Want some advice?

79
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:03,857
Well, yeah.

80
00:07:03,957 --> 00:07:04,958
Here's all you
need to know:

81
00:07:05,058 --> 00:07:06,393
classes--nothing
before 11:00;

82
00:07:06,494 --> 00:07:07,895
beer--your best friend,
you drink a lot of it;

83
00:07:07,995 --> 00:07:09,162
women--you're a freshman,

84
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:10,163
so it's pretty much
out of the question.

85
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:11,565
Will you have a car?
Um, no.

86
00:07:11,665 --> 00:07:13,033
Someone on
your hall will.

87
00:07:13,133 --> 00:07:14,267
Find them and make friends
with them on the first day.

88
00:07:14,502 --> 00:07:16,537
Anything else?

89
00:07:16,637 --> 00:07:18,739
Yeah. Um...

90
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:20,541
look, uh,

91
00:07:20,641 --> 00:07:22,843
can anyone just, uh,

92
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:26,614
live in these big houses
with--with girls?

93
00:07:28,516 --> 00:07:31,719
Times have changed in
the past 30 years, Tomas.

94
00:07:31,819 --> 00:07:33,053
We no longer swill sherry

95
00:07:33,153 --> 00:07:34,955
and screw goats
for fun anymore.

96
00:07:35,055 --> 00:07:36,890
I'd love to tell
you about it, but...

97
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:39,627
Should I just leave
my stuff in your room?

98
00:07:39,727 --> 00:07:40,661
Uh, no.

99
00:07:40,761 --> 00:07:41,995
Look, I'd like
to help you out,

100
00:07:42,095 --> 00:07:43,531
but we're cutting in
on my nap time as it is.

101
00:07:43,597 --> 00:07:44,632
But the good news is

102
00:07:44,732 --> 00:07:45,633
I've got just
the guy for the job.

103
00:07:47,701 --> 00:07:50,538
Yo, Gut,
what's up, baby?

104
00:07:50,604 --> 00:07:51,605
What's up, Droz?

105
00:07:51,705 --> 00:07:52,940
Got any smokes, baby?

106
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,241
No, man, last one.

107
00:07:54,542 --> 00:07:55,909
Listen, Tom-man--

108
00:07:57,678 --> 00:07:58,846
Tom-man here
is a pre-frosh.

109
00:07:58,946 --> 00:08:00,748
I told him you'd
show him around.

110
00:08:00,848 --> 00:08:01,749
No can do.

111
00:08:01,849 --> 00:08:02,816
Whoa, Gut,
can't or won't?

112
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:03,951
Can't, man.

113
00:08:04,051 --> 00:08:05,553
It's grunge night
at Vienna House.

114
00:08:05,619 --> 00:08:06,654
The Merkins are opening

115
00:08:06,754 --> 00:08:07,988
for Frog and Toad
Are Friends.

116
00:08:08,088 --> 00:08:09,022
I got to psych up
for the show.

117
00:08:09,122 --> 00:08:10,390
Frog and Toad
Are Friends,

118
00:08:10,558 --> 00:08:11,892
that's with the guy
from the Clash, right?

119
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:14,394
The?
The Clash.

120
00:08:14,562 --> 00:08:15,829
I don't know if you're
aware of this, Gutter,

121
00:08:15,929 --> 00:08:16,964
but there
actually was music

122
00:08:17,064 --> 00:08:18,799
recorded before 1989.

123
00:08:18,899 --> 00:08:19,900
What is this?

124
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,769
You're wearing this
to the show?

125
00:08:21,869 --> 00:08:23,036
You're gonna
wear the shirt

126
00:08:23,136 --> 00:08:24,838
of the band you're
gonna go see?

127
00:08:24,938 --> 00:08:26,674
Don't be that guy.

128
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,947
Hey!
Dave!

129
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:35,182
Dave, Dave! What's up,
my brothers?

130
00:08:35,282 --> 00:08:36,584
Here we go.
Very quickly,

131
00:08:36,617 --> 00:08:37,851
just a quick
moment of--

132
00:08:37,951 --> 00:08:39,620
It's all right.
Mullaney.

133
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,688
What's up?
Good to see you.

134
00:08:40,788 --> 00:08:41,722
Is this a pre-frosh?

135
00:08:41,822 --> 00:08:42,723
Yes, it is.

136
00:08:42,823 --> 00:08:43,724
You showing him around?

137
00:08:43,824 --> 00:08:44,858
Actually--
You know,

138
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:45,993
that's really swell.

139
00:08:46,093 --> 00:08:47,595
Now, you gotta
make sure he gives you

140
00:08:47,661 --> 00:08:49,029
the special bicentennial
tour, 200 years of bullshit.

141
00:08:49,129 --> 00:08:50,463
You little bitch.

142
00:08:50,598 --> 00:08:51,999
Yep, now we're even
for the milk bones.

143
00:08:52,099 --> 00:08:54,635
You signed me up
as a weekend host.

144
00:08:54,735 --> 00:08:55,669
You swing bag.

145
00:08:55,769 --> 00:08:56,704
Sucker.

146
00:08:56,804 --> 00:08:58,105
Milk bones?

147
00:08:58,205 --> 00:09:00,641
Spring Break, I filled his
suitcase with dog biscuits

148
00:09:00,741 --> 00:09:01,975
coming back
from Jamaica.

149
00:09:02,075 --> 00:09:05,613
Drug-sniffing dogs
went ape shit.

150
00:09:05,713 --> 00:09:07,447
I got one more idea.

151
00:09:07,681 --> 00:09:08,816
Pigman!

152
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:10,884
Pigman!

153
00:09:10,984 --> 00:09:12,185
What's he doing?

154
00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:14,221
He's finishing
his senior thesis.

155
00:09:14,321 --> 00:09:17,024
Pigman is trying to prove
the Caine/Hackman Theory.

156
00:09:17,124 --> 00:09:18,626
No matter what
time it is,

157
00:09:18,726 --> 00:09:20,193
24 hours a day,
you can find

158
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:21,729
a Michael Caine
or a Gene Hackman movie

159
00:09:21,829 --> 00:09:23,096
playing on TV.

160
00:09:23,196 --> 00:09:24,632
Wait, that's his thesis?
Yes!

161
00:09:24,698 --> 00:09:25,633
That's the beauty

162
00:09:25,733 --> 00:09:27,100
of college
these days, Tommy.

163
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,236
You can major in Game Boy
if you know how to bullshit.

164
00:09:29,336 --> 00:09:31,471
Have a seat,
there's the TV.

165
00:09:31,672 --> 00:09:32,873
Pigman's got you covered.

166
00:09:32,973 --> 00:09:36,109
Call me for the shower scene
in Dressed To Kill.

167
00:09:36,209 --> 00:09:38,411
Um...

168
00:09:38,646 --> 00:09:40,013
What?

169
00:09:40,113 --> 00:09:43,150
Did I tell you that
I'm from Delaware?

170
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,852
Really?

171
00:09:44,952 --> 00:09:49,089
Well, I mean, I
just spent 6 hou--

172
00:09:49,189 --> 00:09:50,724
6 hours on
a public bus

173
00:09:50,824 --> 00:09:51,825
just to come
to Port Chester

174
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:53,160
to decide if
I want to come here.

175
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:55,095
So, you know, maybe
I should see the campus

176
00:09:55,195 --> 00:09:56,664
or, you know,
like, a pep rally

177
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:57,665
or a tailgate party.
OK, OK.

178
00:09:57,765 --> 00:10:00,433
OK, OK. I--
I've got it.

179
00:10:00,634 --> 00:10:02,135
Here's the deal.

180
00:10:02,235 --> 00:10:04,071
You gotta get all this
fifties cornball shit

181
00:10:04,171 --> 00:10:05,538
out of your head.

182
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:07,641
It's a whole new ball game
on campus these days,

183
00:10:07,741 --> 00:10:09,209
and they call it PC.

184
00:10:09,309 --> 00:10:10,210
PC?

185
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:11,611
Politically Correct,

186
00:10:11,712 --> 00:10:13,213
and it's not just politics,
it's everything.

187
00:10:13,313 --> 00:10:15,148
it's what you eat,
it's what wear,

188
00:10:15,248 --> 00:10:16,283
and it's what you say.

189
00:10:16,383 --> 00:10:17,584
And if you don't
watch yourself,

190
00:10:17,685 --> 00:10:19,519
you can get in
a butt-load of trouble.

191
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,722
For instance,
see these girls?

192
00:10:21,822 --> 00:10:22,823
Yeah.

193
00:10:22,923 --> 00:10:24,191
No, you don't.
Those are women.

194
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:25,659
You call them girls,
and they'll pop your figs.

195
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:26,727
Save the whales.

196
00:10:26,827 --> 00:10:29,129
Gays in
the military now!

197
00:10:29,229 --> 00:10:30,864
Free Nelson Mandela.

198
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:33,333
They freed him already.

199
00:10:34,935 --> 00:10:36,737
What?

200
00:10:36,837 --> 00:10:38,238
Those women?

201
00:10:38,338 --> 00:10:41,041
Those aren't women, Tom.

202
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:42,575
Those are Womynists.

203
00:10:42,676 --> 00:10:46,814
You know, I saw the new
Madonna video last night.

204
00:10:46,914 --> 00:10:48,581
Unfricking-believable.

205
00:10:48,682 --> 00:10:51,985
See the one in the middle
with the blond hair?

206
00:10:52,085 --> 00:10:53,086
Yeah.

207
00:10:53,186 --> 00:10:55,355
She's looking at me,
isn't she?

208
00:10:55,455 --> 00:10:57,758
Kind of. What, do you
know her or something?

209
00:10:57,858 --> 00:10:58,992
Hey, Sam,

210
00:10:59,092 --> 00:11:01,795
isn't that the guy
that you used to, uh...

211
00:11:01,895 --> 00:11:02,830
Yeah.

212
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:05,098
You went out
with a white male?

213
00:11:05,198 --> 00:11:06,734
I was a freshman.

214
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,068
Freshperson.
Please.

215
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:09,636
Please.

216
00:11:09,737 --> 00:11:11,739
Go talk to her.
What's the problem?

217
00:11:11,805 --> 00:11:13,173
Watch this.

218
00:11:13,273 --> 00:11:16,076
He's coming over here.
Sisters, form a wall!

219
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:19,780
No, you don't
have to do that.

220
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,749
Hi. How you doing?

221
00:11:21,815 --> 00:11:23,383
Is Sam in there?

222
00:11:23,483 --> 00:11:25,819
In there? What's that
supposed to mean?

223
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:27,755
Yeah, cock man
oppressor.

224
00:11:27,821 --> 00:11:28,856
Thank you.

225
00:11:28,956 --> 00:11:31,391
Maybe one of you
could just tell her

226
00:11:31,491 --> 00:11:34,161
that Mr. Pokey
stopped by.

227
00:11:38,832 --> 00:11:40,133
OK.

228
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:44,137
What the hell was that--
Mr. Pokey?

229
00:11:44,237 --> 00:11:47,908
I think he meant
his, uh, phallus.

230
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:52,112
You participated
in a phallus naming?

231
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:55,415
No. No, I have no idea.

232
00:11:55,515 --> 00:11:57,818
You stay away
from him, Sam.

233
00:11:57,918 --> 00:11:59,186
He's an animal.

234
00:11:59,286 --> 00:12:02,022
You know, this place
is kind of insane.

235
00:12:02,122 --> 00:12:04,858
Wait till you meet
the causeheads.

236
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:05,926
The what?

237
00:12:06,026 --> 00:12:07,494
What don't we eat?

238
00:12:07,795 --> 00:12:08,528
Red meat!

239
00:12:08,796 --> 00:12:10,163
Why don't we eat it?

240
00:12:10,263 --> 00:12:11,198
It's murder!

241
00:12:11,298 --> 00:12:12,933
What don't we eat?

242
00:12:13,033 --> 00:12:13,967
Red meat.

243
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:16,069
Why don't we eat it?

244
00:12:16,169 --> 00:12:17,370
These, Tom, are
your causeheads.

245
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:19,106
They find
a world-threatening issue

246
00:12:19,206 --> 00:12:21,308
and stick with it
for about a week.

247
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:22,442
What's up?
What up?

248
00:12:22,542 --> 00:12:24,344
What happened to
the ozone layer?

249
00:12:24,444 --> 00:12:25,913
That was last week.
Now it's meat.

250
00:12:26,013 --> 00:12:27,347
Grill is serving up
chili burgers,

251
00:12:27,447 --> 00:12:29,349
but they're not letting
anyone in or out.

252
00:12:29,449 --> 00:12:31,919
I love chili burgers.
What about you, Daves?

253
00:12:32,019 --> 00:12:33,286
Yeah.
Yeah.

254
00:12:33,386 --> 00:12:34,922
Let's do lunch.

255
00:12:35,022 --> 00:12:37,157
All right.

256
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:38,225
Red meat!

257
00:12:38,325 --> 00:12:39,960
Why don't we eat it?

258
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:40,994
It's murder.

259
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:42,429
What don't we eat?

260
00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:43,663
Red meat.

261
00:12:43,864 --> 00:12:45,598
Why don't we eat it?

262
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:46,666
It's murder!

263
00:12:46,867 --> 00:12:48,101
What don't we eat?

264
00:12:48,201 --> 00:12:50,037
Red meat.

265
00:12:50,137 --> 00:12:51,104
Don't eat us!

266
00:12:51,204 --> 00:12:52,305
It's murder.

267
00:12:52,405 --> 00:12:54,074
Remember, cows
are our friends.

268
00:12:54,174 --> 00:12:55,608
What don't we eat?

269
00:12:55,843 --> 00:12:56,844
Red meat.

270
00:12:56,944 --> 00:12:58,979
Why don't we eat it?

271
00:12:59,079 --> 00:13:00,280
It's murder.

272
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:02,149
The charred flesh
served in this cafeteria...

273
00:13:02,249 --> 00:13:05,118
Oop. Paint.

274
00:13:08,055 --> 00:13:10,190
Harsh bud.

275
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:11,892
And the non-toxic paint...

276
00:13:11,992 --> 00:13:14,094
Moonbeam,
I like your style. Go.

277
00:13:14,194 --> 00:13:15,996
Wrung from
the scorched flesh

278
00:13:16,096 --> 00:13:17,898
of innocent creatures.

279
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:23,436
Go! Go!

280
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:29,009
Wha-what?

281
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:44,157
♪ I was standin' ♪

282
00:13:44,257 --> 00:13:45,458
♪ By my window ♪

283
00:13:45,558 --> 00:13:47,527
You may be saying
to yourselves,

284
00:13:47,627 --> 00:13:51,198
what of the hungry students
of this university?

285
00:13:51,298 --> 00:13:53,633
♪ On a cloudy day ♪

286
00:13:53,733 --> 00:13:57,370
...with the use
of their legs and hands...

287
00:13:58,638 --> 00:14:02,242
Then they would understand
the plight of the field calf.

288
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:04,144
♪ I was standin' ♪

289
00:14:04,244 --> 00:14:07,147
If every student
on this campus...

290
00:14:11,484 --> 00:14:15,655
were to starve, it would be
worth the life of a cow.

291
00:14:15,923 --> 00:14:16,656
Moo!

292
00:14:16,924 --> 00:14:19,059
Yum.

293
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:20,928
Hopefully, this
will not come to pass.

294
00:14:20,994 --> 00:14:25,365
But if it were, who is
to say that the life--

295
00:14:29,036 --> 00:14:30,503
What the hell?

296
00:14:33,006 --> 00:14:34,107
Aah.

297
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:35,943
Hey!

298
00:14:45,953 --> 00:14:47,120
Now.

299
00:14:50,257 --> 00:14:52,125
Here's lunch.

300
00:15:02,169 --> 00:15:03,403
Nicely done,
gentlemen.

301
00:15:03,503 --> 00:15:04,671
All right.
Now what?

302
00:15:04,972 --> 00:15:06,439
Now we run.

303
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,221
Dave.

304
00:15:21,321 --> 00:15:22,622
Dave?

305
00:15:25,192 --> 00:15:27,094
And the walls
are painted white,

306
00:15:27,194 --> 00:15:28,895
and the chalk is white,

307
00:15:28,996 --> 00:15:31,531
and even the copy machine
and paper is white.

308
00:15:31,631 --> 00:15:32,565
Excuse me.

309
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:33,633
This, my friend,

310
00:15:33,733 --> 00:15:35,268
is a white devil's
conspiracy.

311
00:15:35,368 --> 00:15:37,004
Meat tosser!

312
00:15:37,104 --> 00:15:39,006
Stop the violator!

313
00:15:42,409 --> 00:15:45,412
Ohhh!

314
00:15:51,718 --> 00:15:53,286
Level
of insensitivity--

315
00:15:53,386 --> 00:15:55,488
"c," unconscionable.

316
00:15:57,024 --> 00:15:59,026
Offended.

317
00:16:01,561 --> 00:16:04,164
Oh, thank God.
President Garcia-Thompson.

318
00:16:04,264 --> 00:16:05,332
Students,
fill out those forms

319
00:16:05,432 --> 00:16:06,566
and don't skip a line.

320
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:09,102
It was those persons
in the pit again.

321
00:16:09,202 --> 00:16:10,303
I know, Moonbeam.

322
00:16:10,403 --> 00:16:12,139
Those pit offenders
are single-handedly

323
00:16:12,239 --> 00:16:14,641
destroying the sensitivity
levels on this campus.

324
00:16:14,741 --> 00:16:17,410
Of course, I can't simply
throw them out of school.

325
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:20,280
After all, they're still
15 complaints away

326
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:22,315
from expulsion.

327
00:16:22,415 --> 00:16:25,752
Don't worry,
their day will come.

328
00:16:27,054 --> 00:16:29,556
Um, Ms. President?

329
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:32,359
There's some preppy person
in your office.

330
00:16:32,459 --> 00:16:34,627
Madras ties.

331
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:36,529
Sweet.

332
00:16:41,068 --> 00:16:43,470
McPherson, what the hell
are you doing?

333
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:45,505
Ooh, pretty outfit.

334
00:16:45,605 --> 00:16:47,974
Real summery.
What is that, Dacron?

335
00:16:48,075 --> 00:16:51,144
How many times have I told you
not to meet me here?

336
00:16:51,244 --> 00:16:53,246
I have a reputation
to uphold.

337
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:54,281
Don't run from
your feelings.

338
00:16:54,381 --> 00:16:55,315
I think it's
time people

339
00:16:55,415 --> 00:16:56,683
know the truth
about us.

340
00:16:56,783 --> 00:16:59,352
The truth, McPherson,
is that you disgust me.

341
00:16:59,452 --> 00:17:01,488
The only thing we'll
ever have in common

342
00:17:01,588 --> 00:17:03,156
is a hatred of the pit.

343
00:17:03,256 --> 00:17:04,391
Just give it time.

344
00:17:04,491 --> 00:17:07,560
The information,
Republican.

345
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:10,597
Signed, sealed, and...

346
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:14,634
snatched rudely.
What a surprise.

347
00:17:14,734 --> 00:17:18,638
Perfect. I'll bring it
to the pit immediately.

348
00:17:18,738 --> 00:17:21,208
And we'll call
the movers.

349
00:17:28,848 --> 00:17:30,950
Hey, Jack,
the floor's closed

350
00:17:31,118 --> 00:17:32,919
unless you're working
on a thesis.

351
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,122
You working on a thesis?

352
00:17:35,188 --> 00:17:36,456
Uh, no, I'm lost.

353
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:38,958
I'm trying to get
back to the pit.

354
00:17:39,126 --> 00:17:42,462
Well, don't get your balls
in an uproar.

355
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:44,631
Just follow me.

356
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,303
Get your feet
off the desk.

357
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:51,704
Uh, what's
everybody doing?

358
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:53,540
Finishing their theses,
fuzzhead.

359
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,242
They're due
Monday morning.

360
00:17:55,342 --> 00:17:56,543
Now, there's the door.

361
00:17:56,643 --> 00:17:58,211
Oh, thanks.

362
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:04,617
Damn it.

363
00:18:08,388 --> 00:18:10,223
What?

364
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:25,938
Hey, Cecelia, are you
going to be free tonight?

365
00:18:26,206 --> 00:18:27,174
Why?

366
00:18:27,207 --> 00:18:28,175
You want to
have dinner...

367
00:18:28,241 --> 00:18:29,176
with us?

368
00:18:29,276 --> 00:18:30,377
What, like a date?

369
00:18:30,477 --> 00:18:31,411
Yeah.
Yeah.

370
00:18:31,511 --> 00:18:32,479
God.

371
00:18:32,579 --> 00:18:34,013
Katy, I was thinking.

372
00:18:34,214 --> 00:18:35,215
When we start that song,

373
00:18:35,315 --> 00:18:36,649
it's got to be
a lot faster.

374
00:18:36,749 --> 00:18:38,518
You mean
like this?

375
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:40,553
You're in my chair.
Get out.

376
00:18:40,653 --> 00:18:43,590
Now remember to make mine
extra crispy, Gut.

377
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:45,225
Be careful, man.

378
00:18:45,325 --> 00:18:46,793
I like it rare,
not cold.

379
00:18:46,893 --> 00:18:48,595
I got ya.

380
00:18:56,269 --> 00:18:59,038
So, this is the sewer
where you persons

381
00:18:59,206 --> 00:19:01,974
breed your
anti-community crimes.

382
00:19:02,209 --> 00:19:03,610
Hello, Mrs. Gar--

383
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:06,313
President Garcia-Thompson.

384
00:19:06,413 --> 00:19:08,381
Hey, monkeys, how
about a little respect?

385
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:10,450
The presiding person
of the university

386
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:11,818
just walked in.

387
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:22,529
Stop that.

388
00:19:22,629 --> 00:19:25,232
Turn that
noise pollution down.

389
00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:29,369
Please put out
that cigarette right now.

390
00:19:29,469 --> 00:19:30,437
All right.

391
00:19:30,537 --> 00:19:32,272
Do I need to remind you

392
00:19:32,372 --> 00:19:34,241
that this house already
has enough complaints

393
00:19:34,341 --> 00:19:36,776
to qualify for a sensitivity
awareness weekend?

394
00:19:36,876 --> 00:19:38,278
You passed out cigarettes

395
00:19:38,378 --> 00:19:40,680
for a smoke-a-thon
on Earth Day,

396
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:43,816
you installed speed bumps
on the handicapped ramps,

397
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:47,554
and most recently,
you dumped 100 pounds of...

398
00:19:47,654 --> 00:19:50,490
meat on a peaceful
vegan protest.

399
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:51,624
Oh, come on!

400
00:19:51,724 --> 00:19:53,360
That was way more
than 100 pounds.

401
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:55,462
Very amusing,
Mr. Andrews.

402
00:19:55,562 --> 00:19:56,863
Thanks.

403
00:19:56,963 --> 00:20:00,667
Here's something you
won't find quite so funny.

404
00:20:01,601 --> 00:20:02,735
This, offenders,

405
00:20:02,835 --> 00:20:05,372
is your damage bill
for the semester.

406
00:20:05,472 --> 00:20:09,576
The total comes to $7,568.

407
00:20:09,676 --> 00:20:12,379
Housing forms for next year
are due Monday.

408
00:20:12,479 --> 00:20:13,780
And if that bill isn't paid,

409
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,114
this house
will be repossessed.

410
00:20:15,315 --> 00:20:16,583
What?
No way!

411
00:20:16,683 --> 00:20:18,685
You can't be
serious, right?

412
00:20:18,785 --> 00:20:20,653
Now, if you'll excuse me,

413
00:20:20,753 --> 00:20:24,223
I have a bicentennial
to plan.

414
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:26,759
This sucks.

415
00:20:26,859 --> 00:20:29,529
Ma'am, can--
ma'am? Hello?

416
00:20:29,629 --> 00:20:30,930
7 thou?

417
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:33,132
We're in
deep shit, huh?

418
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:34,934
Where the hell are
we gonna live next year?

419
00:20:35,034 --> 00:20:36,703
It's like 3 weeks
before school ends.

420
00:20:36,803 --> 00:20:39,171
Ladies and gentlemen,
I think it's time

421
00:20:39,272 --> 00:20:40,607
to revive
an ancient tradition

422
00:20:40,707 --> 00:20:42,141
we seem to have
long forgotten.

423
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,544
They confiscated
the altar, Droz.

424
00:20:44,644 --> 00:20:46,713
No, I'm not talking
about human sacrifice,

425
00:20:46,813 --> 00:20:49,181
Ceel, I'm talking about
something that we used to do

426
00:20:49,282 --> 00:20:52,452
every Saturday night
as a matter of principle.

427
00:20:56,423 --> 00:20:57,590
Here's a hint:

428
00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:59,859
legions of hand-stamped
meatheads

429
00:20:59,959 --> 00:21:01,961
in co-ed naked
lacrosse t-shirts

430
00:21:02,061 --> 00:21:04,364
power chugging watered-down
Meisterchau,

431
00:21:04,464 --> 00:21:06,165
regurgitating
on the glue-matted floors.

432
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:08,868
Kiln-like temperatures,
fights with townies,

433
00:21:08,968 --> 00:21:10,370
lines of drunken people

434
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:11,571
waiting for
the bathroom.

435
00:21:11,671 --> 00:21:12,805
Wait a second.

436
00:21:12,905 --> 00:21:15,442
You guys are talking
about a party.

437
00:21:15,542 --> 00:21:16,543
Ding, ding, ding,
ding, ding!

438
00:21:16,643 --> 00:21:18,878
Gutter, tell her
what she's won.

439
00:21:18,978 --> 00:21:20,980
We get some beer,
we have a band,

440
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,383
and we overcharge
at the door.

441
00:21:23,483 --> 00:21:24,751
Droz, there's no way.

442
00:21:24,851 --> 00:21:26,986
We need an all-campus party
to raise enough money.

443
00:21:27,086 --> 00:21:28,821
No one's been able to
pull that off in years.

444
00:21:28,921 --> 00:21:29,822
You know what happens--

445
00:21:29,922 --> 00:21:30,857
half the school
protests.

446
00:21:30,957 --> 00:21:32,058
The other half
boycotts.

447
00:21:32,158 --> 00:21:33,560
Yeah, and besides,
think about it.

448
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:34,694
Even if we could
get them all here,

449
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:36,529
it'd be like
a total PC war zone.

450
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:38,130
Well, there is
one other option--

451
00:21:38,365 --> 00:21:39,966
we get jobs.

452
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,435
I vote party.

453
00:21:42,535 --> 00:21:44,236
I can't handle
a job, man.

454
00:21:44,437 --> 00:21:45,538
We're totally on it.

455
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:46,606
What do you
want us to do?

456
00:21:46,706 --> 00:21:48,207
So, uh, who's on beer?

457
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:50,710
Uh, well, that would
roughly be you, Gut.

458
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:52,712
I suggest kegs--
multiple, cold, and domestic.

459
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:54,714
I have to meet
Mersh in Jerry town

460
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:55,815
for my ride
to the show.

461
00:21:55,915 --> 00:21:56,983
OK, well, you call those

462
00:21:57,083 --> 00:21:58,418
useless yerk-toting,
frisbee-chucking

463
00:21:58,518 --> 00:21:59,719
cheeba monkeys,

464
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:01,654
and you tell them you're
gonna be an hour late.

465
00:22:01,754 --> 00:22:03,022
Ceel, Katy, Raj,
and Deege,

466
00:22:03,122 --> 00:22:06,092
the stage is set,
your band will play.

467
00:22:06,192 --> 00:22:07,527
But, Droz, we don't
even have a name.

468
00:22:07,627 --> 00:22:08,995
Well, you get a name,
you give it to the Daves,

469
00:22:09,095 --> 00:22:10,196
they'll put up
the fliers.

470
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:11,263
On it.
On it.

471
00:22:11,464 --> 00:22:13,466
Pigman.
Yeah?

472
00:22:13,566 --> 00:22:14,501
Stay put.

473
00:22:14,601 --> 00:22:16,603
We charge 5 bucks a head.

474
00:22:16,703 --> 00:22:17,937
Mastercard and Visa
accepted.

475
00:22:18,037 --> 00:22:19,038
Droz,

476
00:22:19,138 --> 00:22:22,909
what happened to that
cute preppy kid?

477
00:22:23,009 --> 00:22:24,677
Who?

478
00:22:24,777 --> 00:22:26,012
The pre-frosh.

479
00:22:26,112 --> 00:22:28,014
That's a good question.

480
00:23:01,881 --> 00:23:03,983
What's up, Mersh?

481
00:23:07,687 --> 00:23:09,456
Gutter,
what's up, bud?

482
00:23:09,556 --> 00:23:12,291
Tried to call you guys,
like, 6 times, man.

483
00:23:12,525 --> 00:23:14,994
What's the deal?

484
00:23:16,496 --> 00:23:17,464
Listen, Mersh,

485
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:20,366
I gotta get beer
for this party tonight,

486
00:23:20,467 --> 00:23:23,536
so I'm going to be late
for my ride to Hartford.

487
00:23:23,636 --> 00:23:25,905
Sorry, Gut, man,
no can do.

488
00:23:26,005 --> 00:23:28,641
The Grand Master of Funk

489
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:32,044
descends on the city
at 8:00, man,

490
00:23:32,144 --> 00:23:33,780
and we will be there.

491
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,615
Mersh, you hate punk.

492
00:23:36,883 --> 00:23:38,685
Funk, Gutter.

493
00:23:38,785 --> 00:23:39,719
Funk.

494
00:23:39,819 --> 00:23:40,787
George Clinton.

495
00:23:40,887 --> 00:23:43,255
Parliament Funkadelic.

496
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:44,757
Dude,

497
00:23:44,857 --> 00:23:47,794
aren't you
a music major?

498
00:23:47,894 --> 00:23:48,895
Yeah.

499
00:23:48,995 --> 00:23:51,498
Ha ha ha ha ha!

500
00:23:59,572 --> 00:24:01,974
Maybe you guys could
just give me a lift

501
00:24:02,074 --> 00:24:04,076
to the liquor
store then.

502
00:24:04,176 --> 00:24:05,678
We got intramural
finals this afternoon,

503
00:24:05,778 --> 00:24:06,746
man, sorry.

504
00:24:06,846 --> 00:24:08,981
Well, what am
I supposed to do?

505
00:24:09,081 --> 00:24:11,551
Have a bong hit.

506
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,855
What good is
that going to do me?

507
00:24:15,955 --> 00:24:19,626
Just one little binger
to brighten up your day.

508
00:24:19,726 --> 00:24:22,094
Come on, man.

509
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:26,533
Just one hit,

510
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:28,868
then I got to go.

511
00:24:31,604 --> 00:24:33,205
Look at the stitching.

512
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:35,675
It's got to
be L.L. Bean.

513
00:24:35,775 --> 00:24:36,843
Yes.

514
00:24:36,943 --> 00:24:38,778
But can he be trusted?

515
00:24:38,878 --> 00:24:41,914
Look at his tie.

516
00:24:42,014 --> 00:24:44,016
His complexion.

517
00:24:44,116 --> 00:24:46,018
He's definitely
one of us.

518
00:24:46,118 --> 00:24:48,955
Hey--wait.
Where am I?

519
00:24:49,055 --> 00:24:50,790
You're safe now.

520
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:52,559
Allow me. Carter Prescott,

521
00:24:52,625 --> 00:24:56,095
Pledge Master of the secret
fraternity of Balls and Shaft.

522
00:24:56,195 --> 00:24:58,598
Tom Lawrence,
pre-frosh.

523
00:24:58,698 --> 00:25:00,567
Bantam Draper.

524
00:25:00,667 --> 00:25:01,968
Um...

525
00:25:02,869 --> 00:25:05,271
so, this is a frat?

526
00:25:05,371 --> 00:25:07,574
The school
outlawed fraternities

527
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,576
in 1967, Tom.

528
00:25:09,676 --> 00:25:12,111
And Balls and Shaft was
forced to go underground.

529
00:25:12,211 --> 00:25:13,445
We lost our house,

530
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:15,181
now the detestable sore
known as the pit.

531
00:25:15,281 --> 00:25:18,250
Since then,
our numbers have dwindled,

532
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:21,253
but we're always on
the lookout for new members.

533
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:22,689
You guys used to be
in the pit?

534
00:25:22,789 --> 00:25:24,090
Well, I know it's sad.

535
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:27,293
The swine in there,
they're dirty, stupid--

536
00:25:27,594 --> 00:25:28,728
worst of all,

537
00:25:28,828 --> 00:25:29,762
poor.

538
00:25:31,598 --> 00:25:33,065
I'll get it.

539
00:25:34,801 --> 00:25:36,603
America's greatest
President.

540
00:25:36,669 --> 00:25:37,870
It's me, Rand.
Open up.

541
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:39,606
America's greatest
President.

542
00:25:39,706 --> 00:25:40,940
Damn it.

543
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,274
Who is Ronald Reagan?

544
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:44,010
A casual shoe
for yachting.

545
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:46,478
What are you trying
to figure out, B.D.?

546
00:25:46,613 --> 00:25:49,048
Who could I be?
What is a blucher?

547
00:25:49,148 --> 00:25:50,449
They killed Jesus Christ.

548
00:25:50,617 --> 00:25:53,620
Who are the Jews?
Open up, sucko!

549
00:25:58,024 --> 00:26:00,627
Gentlemen, I've got
some good news,

550
00:26:00,693 --> 00:26:01,694
and I got some
bad news.

551
00:26:01,794 --> 00:26:03,663
The bad news is...

552
00:26:04,697 --> 00:26:05,665
you're an idiot.

553
00:26:05,765 --> 00:26:08,500
Don't ever make me wait
outside that door.

554
00:26:08,701 --> 00:26:09,936
The good news is...

555
00:26:10,036 --> 00:26:11,303
Thompson just delivered
the information.

556
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:12,739
By now, the pit
will have started

557
00:26:12,839 --> 00:26:14,473
planning their
little soiree.

558
00:26:14,674 --> 00:26:16,008
Well, about that, Rand--

559
00:26:16,108 --> 00:26:17,877
What if their party
does come off?

560
00:26:17,977 --> 00:26:20,947
Does anyone get what
I'm doing here?

561
00:26:21,047 --> 00:26:22,314
Does anyone follow me?

562
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:24,884
We want them to have
a party, steakhead.

563
00:26:24,984 --> 00:26:26,052
We want them to
have the loudest,

564
00:26:26,152 --> 00:26:27,119
most offensive party

565
00:26:27,219 --> 00:26:29,188
in school history.
Capisce?

566
00:26:31,658 --> 00:26:32,491
Hi.

567
00:26:32,659 --> 00:26:35,061
Well, well, I see we
have a new pledge.

568
00:26:35,161 --> 00:26:37,129
Mayflower material,
I presume?

569
00:26:37,229 --> 00:26:38,430
Huh?

570
00:26:38,665 --> 00:26:39,699
It's a boat.

571
00:26:39,799 --> 00:26:42,201
Your ancestors obviously
didn't come over on it.

572
00:26:42,301 --> 00:26:44,837
But, hey, it's the nineties.
We'll take what we can get.

573
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:47,339
Gentlemen,
we got a job to do.

574
00:26:49,842 --> 00:26:51,811
Naugahyde Windpipe.

575
00:26:51,911 --> 00:26:53,512
Too metal.

576
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:56,015
Oedipus
and the Mama's Boys.

577
00:26:56,115 --> 00:26:57,784
Too college radio.

578
00:26:57,884 --> 00:27:01,754
My Johnson
Is 12 Inches Long.

579
00:27:02,789 --> 00:27:03,990
Interesting,

580
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:07,226
but doesn't sound
like a band name.

581
00:27:08,127 --> 00:27:09,829
I've got it.

582
00:27:09,929 --> 00:27:11,563
Everyone Gets Laid.

583
00:27:11,698 --> 00:27:14,801
Katy, the Womynists will be
all over us for that one.

584
00:27:14,901 --> 00:27:16,135
Ow.

585
00:27:16,235 --> 00:27:17,536
Hey, Droz, what do
you think about this?

586
00:27:17,704 --> 00:27:19,772
Tonight at the pit,
Everyone Gets Laid.

587
00:27:19,872 --> 00:27:23,242
Hmm. That's tasteless,
disgusting, and offensive.

588
00:27:23,342 --> 00:27:24,510
I like it.

589
00:27:24,777 --> 00:27:25,712
Cool.

590
00:27:25,778 --> 00:27:27,479
Daves, go make
those fliers.

591
00:27:27,714 --> 00:27:29,315
Hey,

592
00:27:29,415 --> 00:27:30,582
what are you guys
doing?

593
00:27:30,783 --> 00:27:32,184
Us? Oh, we're seniors.

594
00:27:32,284 --> 00:27:34,286
We're going to the game.

595
00:27:34,386 --> 00:27:35,454
Outside!

596
00:27:35,722 --> 00:27:36,823
Whoo!

597
00:27:36,923 --> 00:27:38,324
Uhh!
Uhh!

598
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:44,563
Hey.

599
00:27:44,731 --> 00:27:46,098
Remove that nail,
butcher.

600
00:27:46,198 --> 00:27:47,566
What's your deal?

601
00:27:47,734 --> 00:27:49,068
I just heard
that tree shriek.

602
00:27:49,168 --> 00:27:50,269
Would you like it
if I nailed a sign

603
00:27:50,369 --> 00:27:52,338
into a layer
of your fat?

604
00:27:52,438 --> 00:27:54,073
Try it again,
and you're toast.

605
00:27:54,173 --> 00:27:56,375
Save the planet.
Peace.

606
00:27:58,878 --> 00:28:01,047
This is a total drag.

607
00:28:01,147 --> 00:28:03,249
Let's give up, man.

608
00:28:13,059 --> 00:28:16,095
Well, what do
we have here?

609
00:28:19,832 --> 00:28:20,833
Let's go!

610
00:28:20,933 --> 00:28:22,334
Whoo!

611
00:28:22,434 --> 00:28:27,239
Yeah, yeah.
Look at him go!

612
00:28:30,777 --> 00:28:31,844
Pig.

613
00:28:33,345 --> 00:28:35,014
Oh, good, good God.

614
00:28:35,114 --> 00:28:36,015
Word up.

615
00:28:36,115 --> 00:28:38,317

628
00:29:04,010 --> 00:29:05,077
Yeah.

629
00:29:05,177 --> 00:29:07,880
Isn't that your old
freshman roommate?

630
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:08,915
Oh, yeah.

631
00:29:09,015 --> 00:29:10,316
Randall Peeburn McPherson.

632
00:29:10,416 --> 00:29:12,384
I wonder what brought him
out of hiding.

633
00:29:12,484 --> 00:29:14,120
Must be
a Klan meeting.

634
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:15,421
Yeah.
Man, look at him.

635
00:29:15,521 --> 00:29:17,523
Must have been hellish
living with that guy

636
00:29:17,824 --> 00:29:19,158
for a year.

637
00:29:28,167 --> 00:29:30,369
Ahem.

638
00:29:30,469 --> 00:29:32,204
Ahem.

639
00:29:32,304 --> 00:29:34,040
Hey, wait,
come back.

640
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:36,042
Oh, come on!
Go to sleep!

641
00:29:36,142 --> 00:29:37,343
Go to sleep!

642
00:29:37,443 --> 00:29:39,545
It's time to
go to sleep!

643
00:29:39,846 --> 00:29:42,448
Oh, my God! Aah!

644
00:29:42,548 --> 00:29:43,649
Ah! Aah!

645
00:29:43,916 --> 00:29:44,984
Aah!

646
00:29:45,084 --> 00:29:47,086
Get away from me,
you freak!

647
00:29:47,186 --> 00:29:49,388
Freak!

648
00:29:49,488 --> 00:29:52,558
Aah!
Stay on your side!

649
00:29:52,859 --> 00:29:53,926
Aah!

650
00:29:55,294 --> 00:29:57,396
Total nightmare, man.

651
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:01,800
What the hell
is taking so long?

652
00:30:04,971 --> 00:30:08,174
Swirly.

653
00:30:08,274 --> 00:30:09,775
Whoo!

654
00:30:09,876 --> 00:30:12,979
The pride of the Port Chester
sports program, Tom--

655
00:30:13,079 --> 00:30:14,380
Hippie Olympics.

656
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,016
Doesn't matter who wins
'cause they're all losers.

657
00:30:17,116 --> 00:30:19,151
You know,
it's sad, really.

658
00:30:19,251 --> 00:30:20,987
This school
used to be

659
00:30:21,087 --> 00:30:23,522
a bastion of rich,
white elitism.

660
00:30:23,622 --> 00:30:27,826
Now...now there are homosexuals
on the football team,

661
00:30:27,927 --> 00:30:30,062
whining minorities run
the student government,

662
00:30:30,162 --> 00:30:32,298
and you can't even
coerce a woman

663
00:30:32,398 --> 00:30:33,966
into having sex
without being

664
00:30:34,066 --> 00:30:35,434
brought up
on charges.

665
00:30:35,534 --> 00:30:37,003
What is this world
coming to?

666
00:30:37,103 --> 00:30:38,004
Really!

667
00:30:38,104 --> 00:30:40,172
Come on.
Let's go.

668
00:30:40,272 --> 00:30:41,373
My pappy would puke

669
00:30:41,473 --> 00:30:43,275
if he saw this bunch
of bug-eyed toads

670
00:30:43,375 --> 00:30:45,544
chasing a scrap
of plastic around.

671
00:30:45,644 --> 00:30:47,646
Hey, ponytails,
you suck!

672
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,415
Hi.

673
00:30:49,515 --> 00:30:52,218
We're getting housed
here, guys.

674
00:30:52,318 --> 00:30:54,987
I say we bring in
Blotter.

675
00:30:55,087 --> 00:30:57,023
Blotter.
Blotter.

676
00:30:57,123 --> 00:31:00,392
Yeah.
Yeah.

677
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:21,080
Wha-whoo,
yeah, Blotter!

678
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:23,382

bugging me!

I'm going in, Coach.
Cover me, man.

685
00:31:35,127 --> 00:31:37,563
Yeah, yeah.
Whatever. Yeah.

686
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,301
Sam?

687
00:31:42,401 --> 00:31:43,835
Hey. Wow!

688
00:31:44,036 --> 00:31:45,104
What are
the odds?

689
00:31:45,204 --> 00:31:47,339
Droz. Two times
in one day.

690
00:31:47,439 --> 00:31:48,640
What's come over you?

691
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,009
I don't know,
must be hormonal.

692
00:31:50,109 --> 00:31:52,444
What the hell
is he doing here?

693
00:31:52,544 --> 00:31:53,479
Afternoon, ladies.

694
00:31:53,579 --> 00:31:55,081
Looking good
out there.

695
00:31:55,181 --> 00:31:56,615
Yeah.
Whatever.

696
00:31:58,584 --> 00:32:00,486
They're not going
to castrate me

697
00:32:00,586 --> 00:32:01,988
for sitting here,
are they?

698
00:32:02,054 --> 00:32:04,991
Yeah, that's what they got
planned for halftime.

699
00:32:07,359 --> 00:32:10,329
Oh. Now, look
who it is.

700
00:32:10,429 --> 00:32:12,999
Meat tosser!

701
00:32:16,002 --> 00:32:17,136
Aah!

702
00:32:17,236 --> 00:32:18,204
Aah!

703
00:32:18,304 --> 00:32:21,007
Jesus Christ.
I know that kid.

704
00:32:21,107 --> 00:32:22,674
What is he doing?

705
00:32:24,043 --> 00:32:26,012
I'm open.

706
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:27,779
Aah! Ohh!

707
00:32:28,014 --> 00:32:30,016
Hey.

708
00:32:32,651 --> 00:32:35,721
That weasel
snagged the 'bee.

709
00:32:36,022 --> 00:32:37,389
All right.

710
00:32:37,489 --> 00:32:39,691
Bong hits, anyone?

711
00:32:41,027 --> 00:32:42,261
All right.

712
00:32:42,361 --> 00:32:44,663
So, I heard you're
finally graduating.

713
00:32:44,763 --> 00:32:46,598
Yeah, yeah. It's
pretty stupid, huh?

714
00:32:46,698 --> 00:32:49,568
I mean, how could
I leave all this?

715
00:32:49,668 --> 00:32:51,703
What about you?
You got any plans?

716
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:53,639
James Andrews,
my old friend.

717
00:32:53,739 --> 00:32:54,673
Hey, Rand.

718
00:32:54,773 --> 00:32:56,608
Samantha, my buttercup.

719
00:32:56,708 --> 00:32:59,245
I hear you're having
a party tonight.

720
00:32:59,345 --> 00:33:00,479
Can't go.

721
00:33:00,579 --> 00:33:02,214
But we're all taking bets

722
00:33:02,314 --> 00:33:04,216
on how many of you
will get arrested.

723
00:33:04,316 --> 00:33:05,317
You remember
this guy,

724
00:33:05,417 --> 00:33:06,418
he skippered
Hitler's catamaran

725
00:33:06,518 --> 00:33:07,519
during the war?

726
00:33:07,619 --> 00:33:08,654
Yeah, yuck it
up now, dipshit.

727
00:33:08,754 --> 00:33:10,456
Your nightmare's
just beginning.

728
00:33:10,556 --> 00:33:13,092
I think the Womynists
will be quite interested

729
00:33:13,192 --> 00:33:14,426
in your little scribblings.

730
00:33:14,526 --> 00:33:15,627
Oh, yeah,

731
00:33:15,727 --> 00:33:17,496
that's where I'm headed.

732
00:33:17,596 --> 00:33:20,766
Samantha,
always a pleasure.

733
00:33:21,067 --> 00:33:22,134
See you.

734
00:33:24,303 --> 00:33:26,072
Gentlemen.

735
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,076
Ladies.

736
00:33:33,579 --> 00:33:34,646
A pit party.

737
00:33:34,746 --> 00:33:37,449
Mmm. Warm, flat beer.

738
00:33:37,549 --> 00:33:40,252
Soggy chips.
Think about that.

739
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:43,589
It's just what I need to
help me figure out my life.

740
00:33:43,689 --> 00:33:45,491
Stop the penis party!

741
00:33:45,591 --> 00:33:47,359
Get her away
from him!

742
00:33:47,459 --> 00:33:48,894
Come on,
Sam!

743
00:33:49,128 --> 00:33:50,096
Let's go.

744
00:33:50,129 --> 00:33:51,363
Hey, Sam, what
about tonight?

745
00:33:51,463 --> 00:33:53,865
Don't talk to him.

746
00:33:54,133 --> 00:33:55,567
Shit.

747
00:33:55,667 --> 00:33:57,936
Whoo-hoo! Yeah-heh!

748
00:34:02,408 --> 00:34:05,177
Hey, watch it,
you schmuck!

749
00:34:07,513 --> 00:34:10,416
Get the beer.
Just get the beer.

750
00:34:10,516 --> 00:34:12,418
Get the beer.

751
00:34:12,518 --> 00:34:14,220
The beer.

752
00:34:17,323 --> 00:34:18,390
Excuse me.

753
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:21,793
Can you blow me
where the pampers is?

754
00:34:23,162 --> 00:34:24,130
What?

755
00:34:24,163 --> 00:34:27,133
Can you blow me
where the pampers is?

756
00:34:30,636 --> 00:34:32,371
Can you show me

757
00:34:32,471 --> 00:34:36,208
where the campus is?!

758
00:34:37,376 --> 00:34:38,810
Yeah. Sure.

759
00:34:44,216 --> 00:34:46,318
She knows.

760
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:47,853
She knows.

761
00:34:48,154 --> 00:34:49,155
OK.

762
00:34:49,188 --> 00:34:53,559
Just...just go here
for a minute.

763
00:34:54,693 --> 00:34:57,163
I shouldn't have
smoked that.

764
00:34:57,829 --> 00:35:00,999
I just want
to pay tribute

765
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,469
to both your courage

766
00:35:03,569 --> 00:35:06,172
and for your eloquence

767
00:35:06,205 --> 00:35:09,708
and for the dignity in which
you've conducted yourself.

768
00:35:09,808 --> 00:35:11,743
Thank you, Senator.

769
00:35:11,843 --> 00:35:14,380
I knew it was
going to be bad

770
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,547
when I was nominated.

771
00:35:15,647 --> 00:35:17,683
I didn't know
it would be this bad.

772
00:35:17,783 --> 00:35:20,186
Could you have guessed...

773
00:35:20,286 --> 00:35:24,190
that some people, including
people on this committee,

774
00:35:24,256 --> 00:35:27,793
would dredge up stories
about drug use?

775
00:35:30,596 --> 00:35:32,030
Wait. Wait.
Wait a second,

776
00:35:32,198 --> 00:35:34,266
gentlemen
of the courtroom,

777
00:35:34,366 --> 00:35:37,336
this guy
is Gutter, man.

778
00:35:37,436 --> 00:35:39,004
The Gut man.

779
00:35:39,205 --> 00:35:40,038
He comes over, man,

780
00:35:40,206 --> 00:35:42,040
he smokes two major
bong loads...

781
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:44,075
he knows how to carb
and everything.

782
00:35:44,210 --> 00:35:46,678
Like, loads the size
of your head, man.

783
00:35:46,778 --> 00:35:49,315
I...I didn't exhale?

784
00:35:52,484 --> 00:35:53,652
Works for me.

785
00:35:53,752 --> 00:35:55,020
Good answer.

786
00:36:05,364 --> 00:36:07,433
Oh, man.
What a nightmare.

787
00:36:07,533 --> 00:36:09,268
Oh, man.

788
00:36:09,368 --> 00:36:13,239
Oh. Oh. Oh.

789
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:16,808
Oh, shit! The beer!

790
00:36:16,908 --> 00:36:19,245
Oh, shit!

791
00:36:31,957 --> 00:36:34,893
Are we talking
about the same person?

792
00:36:34,993 --> 00:36:37,496
Well, I think
Bisexual Asian Studies

793
00:36:37,596 --> 00:36:39,498
should have
its own building.

794
00:36:39,598 --> 00:36:40,866
The question is,
who goes:

795
00:36:40,966 --> 00:36:43,269
the Math department
or the hockey team?

796
00:36:43,335 --> 00:36:45,537
Excuse me,
Andrea--

797
00:36:45,637 --> 00:36:46,705
It's Andrea.

798
00:36:46,805 --> 00:36:50,676
I think hockey.
Call me about it.

799
00:36:50,776 --> 00:36:53,279
The board of trustees
is very concerned

800
00:36:53,345 --> 00:36:55,747
about the state of unrest
among the students.

801
00:36:55,847 --> 00:36:57,816
There has been a protest
on this campus

802
00:36:57,916 --> 00:36:59,518
every day, and frankly,

803
00:36:59,618 --> 00:37:02,020
we're sick of all
the bad publicity.

804
00:37:02,288 --> 00:37:03,389
Oh, really?

805
00:37:03,489 --> 00:37:04,823
We're particularly
concerned

806
00:37:04,923 --> 00:37:06,292
about tomorrow's
bicentennial.

807
00:37:06,358 --> 00:37:09,395
It will be the most
highly attended

808
00:37:09,495 --> 00:37:11,397
alumni event in years.

809
00:37:11,497 --> 00:37:12,798
Gentlemen, relax.

810
00:37:12,898 --> 00:37:15,367
Tomorrow's ceremony has been
planned to perfection.

811
00:37:15,467 --> 00:37:16,668
And as for the students,

812
00:37:16,768 --> 00:37:18,837
I have a special
surprise for them.

813
00:37:18,937 --> 00:37:20,772
What are you
talking about?

814
00:37:20,872 --> 00:37:22,408
I'm going to announce

815
00:37:22,508 --> 00:37:24,310
the changing
of the school mascot

816
00:37:24,343 --> 00:37:26,778
from the offensive
Port Chester Indian

817
00:37:26,878 --> 00:37:28,980
to an endangered specie.

818
00:37:32,518 --> 00:37:34,720
Gentlemen,
meet our new mascot,

819
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:37,323
the Port Chester
Whooping Crane.

820
00:37:42,828 --> 00:37:44,496
No. Wait. No!

821
00:37:44,596 --> 00:37:46,898
Look, jerky,
no liquor sold after 8:00.

822
00:37:46,998 --> 00:37:48,600
Connecticut blue laws.

823
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:52,003
After 8:00? I missed
my ride to the show!

824
00:38:01,913 --> 00:38:04,416
Hey, look.
It's a college boy.

825
00:38:04,516 --> 00:38:06,418
Anybody want
to beat him up?

826
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:09,355
Nice tie.

827
00:38:09,455 --> 00:38:11,790
This totally bites.

828
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:13,359
The first time
we've ever been asked

829
00:38:13,459 --> 00:38:15,761
to play in public,
and there's no public.

830
00:38:15,861 --> 00:38:17,763
Yankees are
back in town.

831
00:38:23,435 --> 00:38:25,371
Fuse box.

832
00:38:34,713 --> 00:38:35,747
Aah!

833
00:38:35,847 --> 00:38:37,883
Pins and needles!

834
00:38:37,983 --> 00:38:41,420
Ooh! Pins and needles.
Pins and needles.

835
00:38:46,992 --> 00:38:50,095
Hey, guys, you knocked
the plug out. Hello.

836
00:38:50,396 --> 00:38:51,229
Hey, Raj.

837
00:38:51,397 --> 00:38:53,131
Hey, Daves, what
happened to the fliers?

838
00:38:53,399 --> 00:38:54,400
Huh?

839
00:38:54,466 --> 00:38:56,835
They fliers, I haven't
seen one up on campus.

840
00:38:56,935 --> 00:38:58,404
We put one up.

841
00:38:58,504 --> 00:38:59,471
Damn, man.

842
00:38:59,571 --> 00:39:00,672
One flier?

843
00:39:00,772 --> 00:39:02,608
We're screwed.

844
00:39:02,708 --> 00:39:05,644
There is one thing
we can still do.

845
00:39:05,744 --> 00:39:07,679
Play some loud
and abusive tunes?

846
00:39:07,779 --> 00:39:08,714
Exactly.

847
00:39:08,814 --> 00:39:09,748
Do it, man.
All right.

848
00:39:09,848 --> 00:39:11,417
Plug my ass in.

849
00:39:21,092 --> 00:39:22,894
Yeah.

850
00:39:25,731 --> 00:39:27,566
Yeah.

851
00:39:27,666 --> 00:39:30,802
Play Metallica,
and they will come.

852
00:39:30,902 --> 00:39:34,105
We should've handled
our own publicity.

853
00:40:10,609 --> 00:40:12,310
Whooping cranes.

854
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:15,313
Garcia-Thompson's making
sandwiches without bread.

855
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:17,716
That bitch
is giving me gout.

856
00:40:17,816 --> 00:40:19,818
Look, just be patient,
Cordeau.

857
00:40:19,918 --> 00:40:22,053
The way she's going,
she'll hang herself.

858
00:40:22,153 --> 00:40:25,491
I'll buy the rope,
you find the tree.

859
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:27,993
I'm just one man talking,

860
00:40:28,093 --> 00:40:30,629
but I don't get this
whole James Bond/Rasta--

861
00:40:30,729 --> 00:40:31,630
Hey, I want to know

862
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:32,698
how this became
about me

863
00:40:32,798 --> 00:40:33,765
all of a sudden?

864
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:36,101
This is a miracle.

865
00:40:36,201 --> 00:40:38,537
Monkeys pulled it off.

866
00:40:42,941 --> 00:40:44,776
What the hell's
going on here?

867
00:40:44,876 --> 00:40:46,878
Hi, Droz.

868
00:40:46,978 --> 00:40:49,214
Are we having a party
tonight or what?

869
00:40:49,314 --> 00:40:51,617
There's no publicity,
so there's no people.

870
00:40:51,717 --> 00:40:53,451
Gutter never showed up,
so there's no beer,

871
00:40:53,552 --> 00:40:55,120
our instruments blew out,
so there's no band,

872
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:57,823
and I think Raji
and Deege may be dead.

873
00:40:57,923 --> 00:41:00,091
Wait a minute--
no beer?

874
00:41:00,191 --> 00:41:01,459
Well, where
the hell's Gutter?

875
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:03,094
Probably in a parking
lot somewhere

876
00:41:03,194 --> 00:41:04,730
picking his nose.

877
00:41:06,532 --> 00:41:08,366
Well, there's
one consolation.

878
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:09,735
What's that?

879
00:41:09,835 --> 00:41:11,570
We haven't been
protested yet.

880
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:14,205
Does anybody know why
there are 24 Womynists

881
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:16,074
beating bongos
on our lawn?

882
00:41:16,174 --> 00:41:18,744
Stop this phallic
oppression at this house...

883
00:41:18,844 --> 00:41:20,045
What?

884
00:41:20,145 --> 00:41:21,780
Let's check
it out.

885
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:23,048
Yeah, man.
Coming through.

886
00:41:23,148 --> 00:41:24,282
Coming through.

887
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:26,017
Hey.

888
00:41:26,952 --> 00:41:28,554
All right. Deadly zulu
drum protest.

889
00:41:28,654 --> 00:41:31,823
Haven't seen one of those since
my third sophomore year.

890
00:41:31,923 --> 00:41:33,124
Full-on
response.

891
00:41:33,224 --> 00:41:35,060
Wish the balls
weren't dead.

892
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:36,562
See, you try
and spread joy,

893
00:41:36,628 --> 00:41:39,430
and then the PC shock
troops just shut you down.

894
00:41:39,565 --> 00:41:40,932
Don't they want
to have a good time

895
00:41:41,032 --> 00:41:43,569
at least once
in their lives?

896
00:41:46,204 --> 00:41:48,674
That's a damn
good point.

897
00:41:49,975 --> 00:41:52,177
OK. Now, it's true

898
00:41:52,277 --> 00:41:53,444
the majority
of students today

899
00:41:53,645 --> 00:41:55,046
are so cravenly PC,

900
00:41:55,146 --> 00:41:56,181
they wouldn't know
a good time

901
00:41:56,281 --> 00:41:57,583
if it was sitting
on their face,

902
00:41:57,683 --> 00:41:59,918
but there's one thing

903
00:42:00,018 --> 00:42:03,421
that will always
unite us and them.

904
00:42:03,655 --> 00:42:04,923
They're young.

905
00:42:05,023 --> 00:42:07,158
They may not
realise it yet.

906
00:42:07,258 --> 00:42:08,827
They've got the same
raging hormones,

907
00:42:08,927 --> 00:42:11,162
the same
self-destructive desire

908
00:42:11,262 --> 00:42:14,165
to get boldly trashed
and wildly out of control.

909
00:42:14,265 --> 00:42:15,834
Look out that window.

910
00:42:15,934 --> 00:42:17,969
That's not a protest.

911
00:42:18,069 --> 00:42:20,171
That is a cry for help.

912
00:42:20,271 --> 00:42:21,907
Stop
the penis party!

913
00:42:22,007 --> 00:42:23,474
Stop the penis party!

914
00:42:23,675 --> 00:42:24,876
They're begging us...

915
00:42:24,976 --> 00:42:26,945
please have a party!

916
00:42:27,045 --> 00:42:28,614
Feed us drinks!

917
00:42:28,714 --> 00:42:30,616
Get us laid!

918
00:42:30,682 --> 00:42:32,450
Aah!

919
00:42:32,618 --> 00:42:35,220
That's a pretty
strange theory, Droz.

920
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:36,454
Yeah.

921
00:42:36,622 --> 00:42:37,923
Besides, we don't
have a band

922
00:42:38,023 --> 00:42:38,924
or any people, man.

923
00:42:39,024 --> 00:42:40,491
We don't have
any beer.

924
00:42:40,626 --> 00:42:43,228
We've got loose keg sightings
near the freshman dorm,

925
00:42:43,328 --> 00:42:45,731
two cases of zinfandel
spotted near the faculty club,

926
00:42:45,831 --> 00:42:49,467
and here, the mother lode--
the bicentennial ball.

927
00:42:49,635 --> 00:42:51,002
Moles, you're
on the air in 10.

928
00:42:51,102 --> 00:42:52,037
Got it!

929
00:42:52,137 --> 00:42:53,471
Ceel,
you're on bongos.

930
00:42:53,639 --> 00:42:55,641
Me, Dave, and Dave
are on beer.

931
00:42:55,741 --> 00:42:57,676
Katy, you're a freshman.

932
00:42:57,776 --> 00:43:00,178
Find 2,000 people.

933
00:43:01,112 --> 00:43:02,313
Hey.

934
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:04,249
It's about
time the university

935
00:43:04,349 --> 00:43:06,317
embraced
multiculturalism.

936
00:43:06,652 --> 00:43:07,418
Hey.

937
00:43:07,653 --> 00:43:09,254
It really is.

938
00:43:10,889 --> 00:43:11,890
Excuse me.

939
00:43:11,990 --> 00:43:13,324
Uh-huh.

940
00:43:15,927 --> 00:43:18,129
What is the complaint
count now?

941
00:43:18,229 --> 00:43:19,164
Hello,
Andrea.

942
00:43:19,264 --> 00:43:21,132
Only 3
this afternoon,

943
00:43:21,232 --> 00:43:22,934
but my Community
Crisis Bulletin

944
00:43:23,034 --> 00:43:24,803
just went out. OK?

945
00:43:24,903 --> 00:43:26,705
Well, don't worry,
my fair maiden,

946
00:43:26,805 --> 00:43:28,106
we will get our quota.

947
00:43:28,206 --> 00:43:29,908
And by the way,

948
00:43:30,008 --> 00:43:32,778
have you seen
their tasteless flier?

949
00:43:35,013 --> 00:43:38,116
Oh, my God.

950
00:43:38,216 --> 00:43:40,351
Is there no limit?

951
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:44,289
Well...what I figure
they did...

952
00:43:44,389 --> 00:43:46,291
was they cut out
a picture of your head

953
00:43:46,391 --> 00:43:48,694
and pasted it on another
different picture.

954
00:43:48,794 --> 00:43:52,330
I've done a little
collage work myself.

955
00:43:56,835 --> 00:43:58,203
B.D., do me a favour

956
00:43:58,303 --> 00:44:00,105
and don't ever talk.

957
00:44:05,443 --> 00:44:07,946
Hey, kid, do you know
how to get back

958
00:44:08,046 --> 00:44:09,280
to I-84?

959
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:10,982
Where you going,
Hartford?

960
00:44:11,082 --> 00:44:12,884
Yeah, man, we got
a concert there.

961
00:44:12,984 --> 00:44:14,619
We should have
been there at 8:00.

962
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:17,088
I know. The Merkins
and Frog and Toad.

963
00:44:17,188 --> 00:44:18,156
What?

964
00:44:18,256 --> 00:44:19,257
The bad news is,

965
00:44:19,357 --> 00:44:21,159
84 is, like,
a half-hour away,

966
00:44:21,259 --> 00:44:22,427
and then
Hartford is,

967
00:44:22,527 --> 00:44:24,429
like, another 45 minutes
on the freeway.

968
00:44:24,529 --> 00:44:27,132
Seth, I told you we should
have followed the other bus.

969
00:44:27,232 --> 00:44:28,233
We'll never make it now.

970
00:44:28,333 --> 00:44:29,267
We might as well
go on back home.

971
00:44:29,367 --> 00:44:31,302
Yo, dread.
Yeah, what's up?

972
00:44:31,402 --> 00:44:32,804
Since you missed
the show anyway,

973
00:44:32,904 --> 00:44:34,305
you think you could give me
a ride back to my house?

974
00:44:34,405 --> 00:44:36,107
Yeah. Come on.
Get on up.

975
00:44:36,207 --> 00:44:37,776
Shotgun.

976
00:44:39,044 --> 00:44:40,946
Which
one's Rand's?

977
00:44:41,046 --> 00:44:43,014
Cherry beemer.
"Thanks, Dad."

978
00:44:43,114 --> 00:44:44,916
I can wire it.
Can you get us in?

979
00:44:45,016 --> 00:44:48,119
It might take
a little time, but...

980
00:44:48,219 --> 00:44:49,755
Yeah. I think so.

981
00:44:49,821 --> 00:44:52,290
that was
George Clinton on WPCU

982
00:44:52,390 --> 00:44:53,591
with Tear the Roof Off.

983
00:44:53,759 --> 00:44:55,426
Clinton's headlining
the Civic tonight,

984
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:58,296
but you can't afford
a ticket, man. Sorry.

985
00:44:58,396 --> 00:45:01,232
Moles. How's it going,
brother?

986
00:45:01,332 --> 00:45:02,968
What's up?
Great show, man.

987
00:45:03,068 --> 00:45:04,202
Thanks, man.

988
00:45:04,302 --> 00:45:06,337
No, really. Listen,
I got a favour to ask...

989
00:45:08,774 --> 00:45:10,375
Well, that's
good thinking.

990
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:16,014
Oh.

991
00:45:16,114 --> 00:45:17,983
Ooh.

992
00:45:18,083 --> 00:45:19,017
Eek.

993
00:45:19,117 --> 00:45:20,986
Ah...

994
00:45:30,195 --> 00:45:31,997
Toss 'em in back.

995
00:45:38,436 --> 00:45:40,806
Sunroof. All right.

996
00:45:42,107 --> 00:45:43,274
Rand's going to
griz his pants

997
00:45:43,374 --> 00:45:44,609
when he sees his car.

998
00:45:44,843 --> 00:45:45,877
You think so?

999
00:45:45,977 --> 00:45:49,314
Good evening.
We interrupt this broadcast

1000
00:45:49,414 --> 00:45:51,649
for a special
announcement.

1001
00:45:51,817 --> 00:45:54,319
Are you just sitting
around your dorm rooms

1002
00:45:54,419 --> 00:45:56,554
playing cards
and eating pizza?

1003
00:45:56,654 --> 00:45:58,489
Now, is this the way
you've spent the majority

1004
00:45:58,589 --> 00:46:00,091
of your 4 years in college?

1005
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:01,459
Would you like tonight
to be different,

1006
00:46:01,559 --> 00:46:03,128
you just don't have
anyplace to go?

1007
00:46:03,228 --> 00:46:04,429
Well, now you do.

1008
00:46:04,529 --> 00:46:06,832
So, turn off your radios
and head on over.

1009
00:46:06,898 --> 00:46:09,367
And tonight,
10 P.M. at the pit,

1010
00:46:09,467 --> 00:46:12,503
Everyone Gets Laid.

1011
00:46:36,962 --> 00:46:38,930
K-Katy?

1012
00:46:39,030 --> 00:46:40,365
Katy!

1013
00:46:41,466 --> 00:46:44,435
It's the pre-frosh.

1014
00:46:44,535 --> 00:46:46,537
Stay!

1015
00:46:52,944 --> 00:46:54,245
Hi.
Hey.

1016
00:46:54,345 --> 00:46:55,881
We were wondering
what happened to you.

1017
00:46:55,947 --> 00:46:57,482
Where you going?

1018
00:46:57,582 --> 00:46:59,985
Uh, I'm
gonna go home.

1019
00:47:00,085 --> 00:47:01,719
You're leaving?

1020
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:04,455
You've only been here,
like, 10 minutes.

1021
00:47:04,555 --> 00:47:05,756
I know, but, you know,

1022
00:47:05,891 --> 00:47:07,258
I've already managed
to piss off, like,

1023
00:47:07,358 --> 00:47:08,393
the entire campus.

1024
00:47:08,493 --> 00:47:09,494
I mean,
no offence, Katy,

1025
00:47:09,594 --> 00:47:11,562
but this place
is a nightmare.

1026
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:14,399
I'm probably just
gonna wind up at State.

1027
00:47:14,499 --> 00:47:17,102
Yeah, well,
we're all gonna be

1028
00:47:17,202 --> 00:47:18,403
boring our butts
off at State

1029
00:47:18,503 --> 00:47:20,338
if I don't find, like,
1,000 people pronto.

1030
00:47:20,438 --> 00:47:22,007
What do you mean?

1031
00:47:22,107 --> 00:47:23,274
We gotta raise
7 Gs by tomorrow,

1032
00:47:23,374 --> 00:47:24,275
or we lose the house.

1033
00:47:24,375 --> 00:47:25,944
The pit?
Yeah.

1034
00:47:26,044 --> 00:47:27,278
The damage bill came in.

1035
00:47:27,378 --> 00:47:29,080
We're trying to pull off
this all-campus rage,

1036
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:30,916
and I gotta get people.

1037
00:47:30,982 --> 00:47:34,419
All I got are these
foreign exchange students.

1038
00:47:38,523 --> 00:47:40,225
It's looking
pretty grim.

1039
00:47:40,325 --> 00:47:41,359
I can't believe this.

1040
00:47:41,459 --> 00:47:42,493
I mean, you're,
like, the only ones

1041
00:47:42,593 --> 00:47:43,761
that haven't
tried to kill me

1042
00:47:43,962 --> 00:47:45,596
since I got here.

1043
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:48,066
Yeah, but you're probably
not going to be

1044
00:47:48,166 --> 00:47:50,201
coming here anyway, so...

1045
00:47:50,301 --> 00:47:51,937
don't sweat it.

1046
00:47:54,172 --> 00:47:57,342
Oh...your ride's here.

1047
00:47:58,243 --> 00:47:59,978
It was nice knowing you.

1048
00:48:22,167 --> 00:48:23,468
Katy!

1049
00:48:27,172 --> 00:48:29,507
You said you needed
people, right?

1050
00:48:29,607 --> 00:48:32,143
Am I OK
on that side?

1051
00:48:32,243 --> 00:48:33,544
Nope.
No.

1052
00:48:37,215 --> 00:48:38,583
That's good.

1053
00:48:40,285 --> 00:48:42,453
Hey. Hey!

1054
00:48:55,733 --> 00:48:58,603
I'll take care of Apeman.
You grab the bar.

1055
00:49:01,039 --> 00:49:02,840
Hey there, B.D.

1056
00:49:03,008 --> 00:49:05,410
Andrews. You're not
supposed to be here.

1057
00:49:05,510 --> 00:49:07,012
Hey, now, that is
one great tie.

1058
00:49:07,078 --> 00:49:09,047
Is that yours,
or did you borrow it?

1059
00:49:09,147 --> 00:49:10,381
It's mine.

1060
00:49:10,481 --> 00:49:11,916
Really? That is amazing.
Where did you get that?

1061
00:49:12,017 --> 00:49:13,584
because I've been looking
for something like this.

1062
00:49:13,684 --> 00:49:15,053
What are those?
Those little snails?

1063
00:49:15,153 --> 00:49:16,354
They're jockeys.

1064
00:49:16,454 --> 00:49:19,457
Really? 'Cause, uh,
they look like snails.

1065
00:49:19,557 --> 00:49:23,094
Listen, uh, what kind
of beer do you got?

1066
00:49:23,194 --> 00:49:24,595
Uh, well,
we don't have--

1067
00:49:24,695 --> 00:49:25,696
You know,
on second thought,

1068
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:26,897
what am I doing?
I'm driving.

1069
00:49:27,032 --> 00:49:28,733
Make it a scotch
on the rocks.

1070
00:49:29,034 --> 00:49:29,800
What?

1071
00:49:30,035 --> 00:49:31,202
You're right.

1072
00:49:31,302 --> 00:49:32,303
You're a good
friend, B.D.

1073
00:49:32,403 --> 00:49:34,205
You saved my life.
I mean that.

1074
00:49:34,305 --> 00:49:35,573
You're a hell
of a guy.

1075
00:49:35,673 --> 00:49:38,076
I'm never going
to forget this.

1076
00:49:39,710 --> 00:49:41,246
Pardon me.
Excuse me.

1077
00:49:41,346 --> 00:49:45,050
Say, you know, there's a very
interesting studies group...

1078
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:51,156
A vodka tonic,
please.

1079
00:49:53,524 --> 00:49:56,261
99, repeat.

1080
00:50:04,202 --> 00:50:05,136

00:50:27,425 --> 00:50:28,559
Brothers.

1086
00:50:28,659 --> 00:50:30,561
I saw him at
the cafeteria this morning.

1087
00:50:30,661 --> 00:50:31,796
He was recruiting
for the CIA.

1088
00:50:32,029 --> 00:50:33,030
CIA, huh?!

1089
00:50:33,131 --> 00:50:34,932
I heard he injected
all the meat with hormones

1090
00:50:35,032 --> 00:50:36,767
before throwing it
off the roof.

1091
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:38,569
He is wearing
brown shoes

1092
00:50:38,669 --> 00:50:39,670
with
a blue blazer.

1093
00:50:39,770 --> 00:50:40,838
I mean, can you
believe it?

1094
00:50:41,072 --> 00:50:41,972
How hinge!

1095
00:50:42,073 --> 00:50:43,374
What are they
so pissed off at?

1096
00:50:43,474 --> 00:50:44,542
Watch this.

1097
00:50:44,642 --> 00:50:47,212
Hey, butt-licks!

1098
00:50:47,312 --> 00:50:49,046
Shh.

1099
00:50:50,081 --> 00:50:51,216
Remember me?

1100
00:50:51,316 --> 00:50:52,417
Jesus Christ, Tom!

1101
00:50:52,517 --> 00:50:53,551
That's the guy!

1102
00:50:56,487 --> 00:50:58,055
Let's go!

1103
00:51:04,229 --> 00:51:06,697
This
penis party's got to go.

1104
00:51:06,797 --> 00:51:08,366
Hey hey. Ho ho.

1105
00:51:08,466 --> 00:51:10,501
This penis party's
got to go.

1106
00:51:10,601 --> 00:51:12,237
Hey hey. Ho ho.

1107
00:51:12,337 --> 00:51:14,305
This penis party's
got to go.

1108
00:51:14,405 --> 00:51:15,973
Hey hey. Ho ho.

1109
00:51:16,141 --> 00:51:18,309
This penis party's
got to go.

1110
00:51:18,409 --> 00:51:20,211
Hey hey. Ho ho.

1111
00:51:20,311 --> 00:51:22,413
This penis party's
got to go.

1112
00:51:22,513 --> 00:51:24,249
Hey hey. Ho ho.

1113
00:51:24,349 --> 00:51:25,250

Droz. Droz,

1124
00:51:59,617 --> 00:52:00,718
what are we
going to do

1125
00:52:00,818 --> 00:52:02,187
when we don't
pull this one off?

1126
00:52:02,287 --> 00:52:04,189
Uh, bake sale?

1127
00:52:04,289 --> 00:52:06,324
What's up, Droz?
What's up, Moles?

1128
00:52:06,424 --> 00:52:07,392
You screwed up big-time.

1129
00:52:07,492 --> 00:52:08,659
The store was closed.

1130
00:52:08,759 --> 00:52:10,328
I put my trust in you
to handle the beer,

1131
00:52:10,428 --> 00:52:11,496
and you violated
that trust.

1132
00:52:11,596 --> 00:52:12,530
Yo, Gutter, Gutter,
where it at?

1133
00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:13,598
Where it at?

1134
00:52:13,698 --> 00:52:14,699
Oh, right
in there, sorry.

1135
00:52:14,799 --> 00:52:15,666
What's happenin',
what's happenin'?

1136
00:52:15,766 --> 00:52:16,901
Mudbone,
get in there.

1137
00:52:17,001 --> 00:52:18,035
Listen, don't charge
these guys, Moles.

1138
00:52:18,203 --> 00:52:19,204
They just gotta
use the can.

1139
00:52:19,304 --> 00:52:20,471
They're with me.

1140
00:52:20,571 --> 00:52:21,639
Droz,
that was--

1141
00:52:21,739 --> 00:52:22,773
Do you have any
idea who that was?

1142
00:52:22,873 --> 00:52:24,242
Look, they're just
using the can.

1143
00:52:24,342 --> 00:52:25,476
You made your point.

1144
00:52:25,576 --> 00:52:26,511
That was
George Clinton.

1145
00:52:26,611 --> 00:52:27,678
I'm sorry.

1146
00:52:27,778 --> 00:52:29,247
Listen to me--
Parliament, P-Funk,

1147
00:52:29,347 --> 00:52:30,381
the P-Funk All-Stars.

1148
00:52:30,481 --> 00:52:31,582
I mean, come on,
tell him.

1149
00:52:31,682 --> 00:52:33,484
Dr. Funkenstein?
The man is the king

1150
00:52:33,584 --> 00:52:34,752
of interplanetary
funkmanship.

1151
00:52:34,852 --> 00:52:36,521
Tell him,
tell him who it is.

1152
00:52:36,621 --> 00:52:37,855
It's George Clinton.

1153
00:52:37,955 --> 00:52:39,224
The guy with the hair?

1154
00:52:39,290 --> 00:52:40,258
Yeah.

1155
00:52:40,358 --> 00:52:41,792
Gut, you're
a legend.

1156
00:52:41,892 --> 00:52:44,529
Yo. There are
no chicks in here.

1157
00:52:44,629 --> 00:52:45,730
What did I tell you?

1158
00:52:45,830 --> 00:52:48,399
Yeah, man, there's
not even any chips.

1159
00:52:48,499 --> 00:52:49,867
Chips. Chips.

1160
00:52:49,967 --> 00:52:52,337
Chips! Chips! Chips!

1161
00:52:52,437 --> 00:52:53,438
Chips! Chips! Chips!

1162
00:52:53,538 --> 00:52:55,306
I'll hold it.

1163
00:52:56,941 --> 00:52:57,908
Man.

1164
00:52:58,008 --> 00:53:00,311
Y'all got to
clean that place up.

1165
00:53:00,411 --> 00:53:01,512
Gutter,
get a mop!

1166
00:53:01,612 --> 00:53:02,747
It stink.

1167
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:04,382
Listen, we couldn't
help but notice

1168
00:53:04,482 --> 00:53:05,450
that you're
George Clinton.

1169
00:53:05,550 --> 00:53:06,717
Yeah?

1170
00:53:06,817 --> 00:53:08,453
Listen, George, we've
had a real bad day.

1171
00:53:08,553 --> 00:53:09,854
The president
of the university

1172
00:53:09,954 --> 00:53:12,089
has been spanking us
with a 7-grand damage bill.

1173
00:53:12,257 --> 00:53:13,258
We were gonna
rob a 7-Eleven,

1174
00:53:13,358 --> 00:53:15,293
we don't have
enough ski masks, right?

1175
00:53:15,393 --> 00:53:16,527
So, what are
we gonna do?

1176
00:53:16,627 --> 00:53:17,928
We're gonna throw
an all-campus rocker.

1177
00:53:18,028 --> 00:53:20,498
The only problem is,
we don't have the artillery.

1178
00:53:20,598 --> 00:53:22,367
Nigga, please,
what you want from me?

1179
00:53:22,467 --> 00:53:23,734
What are you
trying to say?

1180
00:53:23,834 --> 00:53:25,370
We were hoping you
could play our party.

1181
00:53:25,470 --> 00:53:26,604
What?

1182
00:53:26,704 --> 00:53:28,373
Well, can't nobody
make no face that ugly

1183
00:53:28,473 --> 00:53:29,840
and not be serious.

1184
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:31,709
We'll do it,
man. Jesus.

1185
00:53:31,809 --> 00:53:33,278
You'll do it?

1186
00:53:33,344 --> 00:53:34,512
Hey, Gut, why don't you
get the band off the van?

1187
00:53:34,612 --> 00:53:35,980
But the whole band
ain't here.

1188
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:37,282
Just tell everybody that's
on the van to come on out.

1189
00:53:37,348 --> 00:53:38,283
All right.

1190
00:53:38,383 --> 00:53:39,550
That's so great. I'm
gonna be right back.

1191
00:53:39,650 --> 00:53:41,118
Yeah, man,
I gotcha. I gotcha.

1192
00:53:41,286 --> 00:53:42,553
Boy, y'all going overboard
with this black awareness.

1193
00:53:42,653 --> 00:53:43,754
That boy got a rap.

1194
00:53:43,854 --> 00:53:44,922
It's equal
opportunity.

1195
00:53:45,022 --> 00:53:47,525
Chips! Chips! Chips!
Chips! Chips!

1196
00:53:47,625 --> 00:53:48,926
Fellas!

1197
00:53:49,894 --> 00:53:52,196
Chuck, porterhouse,
ribeye,

1198
00:53:52,297 --> 00:53:53,998
I know exactly how
you guys are feeling.

1199
00:53:54,098 --> 00:53:55,633
In fact, I can think
of only one thing

1200
00:53:55,733 --> 00:53:59,069
that could lift
my spirits right now...

1201
00:53:59,337 --> 00:54:00,338
beer.

1202
00:54:00,438 --> 00:54:01,572
Beer.

1203
00:54:01,672 --> 00:54:03,308
Beer. Beer.

1204
00:54:03,341 --> 00:54:05,876
Beer. Beer.
Beer! Beer! Beer!

1205
00:54:05,976 --> 00:54:07,878
I think I'm
missing a piece.

1206
00:54:07,978 --> 00:54:10,014
Yeah, me, too, man.
Let's give up, huh?

1207
00:54:10,114 --> 00:54:12,950
Guys, guys, we've got
an L.A.-size riot

1208
00:54:13,050 --> 00:54:16,454
of thirsty men with no necks
screaming for brew.

1209
00:54:17,888 --> 00:54:20,325

Thanks, but I know
how to tune my axe.

Oh, my God.
George Clinton.

1218
00:54:40,345 --> 00:54:41,346
Roof!

1219
00:54:41,446 --> 00:54:42,513
Hi.

1220
00:54:42,613 --> 00:54:44,449
Just the dog in me,
baby.

1221
00:54:44,549 --> 00:54:46,684
Oh, shit! Hi.

1222
00:54:46,784 --> 00:54:47,852
Yeah. Why don't you
play me a song there?

1223
00:54:47,952 --> 00:54:49,153
Go ahead, girl.

1224
00:54:49,420 --> 00:54:50,555
Uh...

1225
00:54:51,989 --> 00:54:54,359
Pig, you gotta
change your PJs.

1226
00:54:54,459 --> 00:54:56,727
We're havin' a party.

1227
00:54:56,827 --> 00:54:59,129
Shower scene.

1228
00:54:59,397 --> 00:55:00,531
Oh.

1229
00:55:02,467 --> 00:55:04,068
Droz.

1230
00:55:04,369 --> 00:55:05,370
Droz!

1231
00:55:05,436 --> 00:55:06,371
Yeah.

1232
00:55:06,404 --> 00:55:07,605
I don't want to
burst your bubble,

1233
00:55:07,705 --> 00:55:08,673
but we got a slight
problem here.

1234
00:55:08,773 --> 00:55:10,375
What?

1235
00:55:10,441 --> 00:55:11,876
No guests.

1236
00:55:14,111 --> 00:55:15,179
Hi. How are you doin'?

1237
00:55:15,413 --> 00:55:17,515
Hey, what up?

1238
00:55:30,928 --> 00:55:32,463
Yeah. That's
right, man.

1239
00:55:32,563 --> 00:55:34,399
I hear what you're sayin'.

1240
00:55:34,465 --> 00:55:36,401
OK. OK--hey!

1241
00:55:36,501 --> 00:55:37,502
Hold on a sec,
everybody.

1242
00:55:37,602 --> 00:55:39,236
Now, I understand
y'all met Tom.

1243
00:55:39,404 --> 00:55:41,572
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
I fucking met Tom!

1244
00:55:41,672 --> 00:55:43,107
He snagged
our disk!

1245
00:55:43,207 --> 00:55:45,075
I know he did, and he's
gonna pay for it, believe me.

1246
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:47,077
Moles, you take
him downstairs,

1247
00:55:47,177 --> 00:55:48,513
and you beat the shit
out of him.

1248
00:55:48,613 --> 00:55:49,880
Yeah!
Yeah!

1249
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:51,716
Sorry, kid.
You heard the man.

1250
00:55:51,816 --> 00:55:52,883
No! No!
Please, no!

1251
00:55:52,983 --> 00:55:54,952
OK. Justice has been
served, everybody.

1252
00:55:55,052 --> 00:55:56,554
You can go home.

1253
00:55:57,988 --> 00:55:59,256
Oh, wait a minute.
What am I saying?

1254
00:55:59,424 --> 00:56:00,991
If you guys aren't doing
anything tonight,

1255
00:56:01,091 --> 00:56:02,292
we got George Clinton
inside.

1256
00:56:02,427 --> 00:56:03,961
He's tuning up
on the main stage.

1257
00:56:04,061 --> 00:56:06,531
Sounds like another one
of the white man's lies to me.

1258
00:56:06,631 --> 00:56:07,598
Yeah!
Yeah!

1259
00:56:10,968 --> 00:56:12,470
Or maybe not.

1260
00:56:12,570 --> 00:56:13,704
Let's check it out.

1261
00:56:13,804 --> 00:56:15,205
Hey, wait a minute!

1262
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:16,474
What about us?

1263
00:56:16,574 --> 00:56:18,042
Yeah, that little dork
tripped over the main plug

1264
00:56:18,142 --> 00:56:19,844
and lost all our theses!

1265
00:56:19,944 --> 00:56:21,979
OK, that's no problem.
You guys come with me.

1266
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:23,448
All right?
The rest of you--

1267
00:56:23,514 --> 00:56:26,451
5 bucks a head,
and the line forms to the left.

1268
00:56:28,519 --> 00:56:29,754
OK. What's your major?

1269
00:56:29,854 --> 00:56:30,888
Um, particle physics?

1270
00:56:30,988 --> 00:56:33,323
That's a tough one.

1271
00:56:33,458 --> 00:56:36,594
Ooh...motion of helium atoms
in an excited stage.

1272
00:56:36,694 --> 00:56:39,029
Watch out,
it's a scorcher.

1273
00:56:39,129 --> 00:56:40,030
Next.

1274
00:56:40,130 --> 00:56:41,832
Uh...Sanskrit.

1275
00:56:41,932 --> 00:56:43,367
Sanskrit.

1276
00:56:43,468 --> 00:56:45,703
You're majoring in
a 5,000-year-old dead language?

1277
00:56:45,803 --> 00:56:47,472
Yeah.

1278
00:56:48,506 --> 00:56:49,273
OK.

1279
00:56:49,540 --> 00:56:50,741
Ooh.

1280
00:56:50,841 --> 00:56:52,276
Latin--it's
the best I can do.

1281
00:56:52,543 --> 00:56:53,478
Next.

1282
00:56:53,578 --> 00:56:54,945
Phys. Ed.

1283
00:56:55,045 --> 00:56:56,781
Phys. Ed. OK,
you're out of my room.

1284
00:56:56,881 --> 00:56:57,915

1285
00:56:58,015 --> 00:57:00,685

All right, sisters.

We've had a mild setback,
but we've regrouped.

1306
00:58:01,679 --> 00:58:03,047
Let's mobilise.

1307
00:58:03,147 --> 00:58:05,750
Isn't this
George Clinton?

1308
00:58:06,851 --> 00:58:08,185
No, couldn't be.

1309
00:58:08,285 --> 00:58:09,754
It's got to be
a cover band,

1310
00:58:09,854 --> 00:58:10,921
he'd never
play the pit.

1311
00:58:11,021 --> 00:58:13,691
Does sound like
him...though.

1312
00:58:13,791 --> 00:58:14,725
Guys...

1313
00:58:14,825 --> 00:58:16,794
maybe we should
bag the protest.

1314
00:58:16,894 --> 00:58:18,362
What?
No! No!

1315
00:58:18,596 --> 00:58:19,664
B-b-but, Sam!

1316
00:58:19,764 --> 00:58:21,131
Their party
flier promotes

1317
00:58:21,231 --> 00:58:22,600
the objectification
of women.

1318
00:58:22,700 --> 00:58:24,569
Maybe...

1319
00:58:24,635 --> 00:58:27,437
but they've also got a really
kickin' party goin' on.

Moonbeam, what are you
doing here?

1504
01:05:48,178 --> 01:05:49,379
All right, everyone.

1505
01:05:49,479 --> 01:05:51,081
You've let
these warped nihilists

1506
01:05:51,181 --> 01:05:53,383
corrupt you long enough.

1507
01:05:53,483 --> 01:05:54,618
Back to your dorms.

1508
01:05:54,718 --> 01:05:55,919
Funk you very much, too.

1509
01:05:56,020 --> 01:05:57,554
Let's get the hell
out of here, y'all.

1510
01:05:57,654 --> 01:06:02,026
We don't need this.
Stomp no more.

1511
01:06:03,527 --> 01:06:06,463
Boo!
Party-pooper.

1512
01:06:06,563 --> 01:06:08,232
Thanks for tanking
the party.

1513
01:06:08,332 --> 01:06:09,766
That was real nice.

1514
01:06:10,034 --> 01:06:12,369
But I got
some bad news.

1515
01:06:12,469 --> 01:06:14,371
We actually raised
enough money,

1516
01:06:14,471 --> 01:06:17,741
so we're keeping
the house.

1517
01:06:18,708 --> 01:06:21,178
Recognise these, Mr. Andrews?

1518
01:06:21,278 --> 01:06:22,546
They're complaint forms.

1519
01:06:22,646 --> 01:06:24,581
And between
today's activities

1520
01:06:24,681 --> 01:06:26,516
and tonight's little
exercise in offensiveness,

1521
01:06:26,616 --> 01:06:28,252
I can assure you

1522
01:06:28,352 --> 01:06:31,621
there are more than enough
to kick you all off campus.

1523
01:06:31,721 --> 01:06:34,558
All right, boys.
Let's close it down.

1524
01:06:34,658 --> 01:06:38,195
I warned you your attitude
was disrupting this campus.

1525
01:06:38,295 --> 01:06:40,230
The students have spoken.

1526
01:06:40,330 --> 01:06:42,599
You're out of here.

1527
01:06:48,605 --> 01:06:51,208
Bye. Thanks
for the party...

1528
01:06:51,308 --> 01:06:52,776
oppressors.

1529
01:06:54,644 --> 01:06:56,080
I've got one question.

1530
01:06:56,146 --> 01:06:58,548
If we're movin' out,
who's movin' in?

1531
01:06:59,483 --> 01:07:01,285
Hi, everybody.

1532
01:07:01,385 --> 01:07:04,121
Hey, what's wrong?

1533
01:07:04,221 --> 01:07:06,390
Aw, looks like you guys
went all out tonight,

1534
01:07:06,490 --> 01:07:09,626
raised $7,000. Wow!

1535
01:07:10,827 --> 01:07:12,162
What's the matter,
forehead,

1536
01:07:12,262 --> 01:07:14,198
trying to figure it out?

1537
01:07:14,298 --> 01:07:15,632
Well, let's see.

1538
01:07:15,732 --> 01:07:17,434
We give you
the damage bill,

1539
01:07:17,534 --> 01:07:19,536
you, of course,
predictably throw

1540
01:07:19,636 --> 01:07:21,738
a disgusting party,
all the freaky freakies

1541
01:07:21,838 --> 01:07:23,640
come out of the woodwork
to protest,

1542
01:07:23,740 --> 01:07:25,775
and you're out of here.

1543
01:07:25,875 --> 01:07:27,744
Well, we still
trashed your beemer,

1544
01:07:27,844 --> 01:07:30,347
you screaming
preppy asshole.

1545
01:07:30,447 --> 01:07:32,182
Right!

1546
01:07:32,282 --> 01:07:34,118
That's not my car.

1547
01:07:35,652 --> 01:07:38,288
Warning. You are too close
to the vehicle.

1548
01:07:38,388 --> 01:07:40,490
Huh...

1549
01:07:40,590 --> 01:07:42,759
Now get off my lawn.

1550
01:07:43,827 --> 01:07:45,295
Move!

1551
01:07:45,395 --> 01:07:46,463
Wait a second.

1552
01:07:46,563 --> 01:07:48,632
You guys can't let
them just walk in

1553
01:07:48,732 --> 01:07:50,500
and take the pit.

1554
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:51,601
We could go
Waco on 'em, man.

1555
01:07:51,701 --> 01:07:52,702
We could blow up
our own house.

1556
01:07:52,802 --> 01:07:55,539
Nah, ran out
of explosives.

1557
01:07:55,639 --> 01:07:56,806
What we need
is a plan.

1558
01:07:56,906 --> 01:07:59,843
OK. Garcia-Thompson's
the president.

1559
01:07:59,943 --> 01:08:01,145
She's the one that's
kicking you out, right?

1560
01:08:01,211 --> 01:08:02,146
Yeah.

1561
01:08:02,246 --> 01:08:04,414
What if she wasn't
the president anymore?

1562
01:08:04,514 --> 01:08:05,982
That sounds nice
in theory and all,

1563
01:08:06,150 --> 01:08:07,684
but how the hell are we supposed
to pull that one off?

1564
01:08:07,784 --> 01:08:09,619
I overheard some
old guys talking.

1565
01:08:09,719 --> 01:08:10,654
They want to
get rid of Thompson,

1566
01:08:10,754 --> 01:08:12,422
but legally they can't,

1567
01:08:12,522 --> 01:08:14,658
not unless she screws
something up

1568
01:08:14,758 --> 01:08:17,661
really, really big.

1569
01:08:38,648 --> 01:08:39,949
Whoo.

1570
01:08:40,217 --> 01:08:41,185
Whoo.

1571
01:08:41,218 --> 01:08:42,286
I'd like to welcome
everyone

1572
01:08:42,386 --> 01:08:47,257
to Port Chester's 200th
Anniversary Celebration.

1573
01:08:49,259 --> 01:08:51,261
Before we get started,
please observe

1574
01:08:51,361 --> 01:08:53,630
that your program notes
have been printed

1575
01:08:53,730 --> 01:08:56,733
on recycled paper.

1576
01:08:59,203 --> 01:09:03,207
Birthdays are a way of
remembering one's history...

1577
01:09:03,273 --> 01:09:04,208
Perfect.

1578
01:09:04,274 --> 01:09:05,409
Those homeless
people at the pit

1579
01:09:05,509 --> 01:09:07,110
didn't even bother
to show.

1580
01:09:07,211 --> 01:09:08,445
They're probably
grubbin' quarters

1581
01:09:08,545 --> 01:09:10,514
at the bus station
by now.

1582
01:09:10,614 --> 01:09:12,949
Welcome PCU's most
recent change,

1583
01:09:13,217 --> 01:09:15,084
our new school mascot,

1584
01:09:15,219 --> 01:09:18,422
the Port Chester
Whooping Crane.

1585
01:09:22,226 --> 01:09:25,595
Hey, guys, it's
a beautiful day, isn't it?

1586
01:09:25,695 --> 01:09:27,364
Oh, God. Not now!

1587
01:09:27,464 --> 01:09:28,465
Hey, what's up?

1588
01:09:29,933 --> 01:09:31,335
Threatened by hunters
and developers

1589
01:09:31,435 --> 01:09:35,539
and those awful plastic
six-pack can holder things.

1590
01:09:35,639 --> 01:09:37,507
But here at Port Chester,

1591
01:09:37,607 --> 01:09:39,243
she will be closely watched
and tended to,

1592
01:09:39,309 --> 01:09:42,712
safe and enclosed
from a natural habitat

1593
01:09:42,812 --> 01:09:44,080
that is so fraught
with danger.

1594
01:09:44,314 --> 01:09:45,249
Oh, my God.

1595
01:09:45,315 --> 01:09:48,452
I hear they
taste like chicken.

1596
01:09:52,622 --> 01:09:54,258
What's he doing?

1597
01:09:54,324 --> 01:09:56,260
Let's all give it up
for Andrea Garcia-Thompson

1598
01:09:56,360 --> 01:10:00,597
and her amazing and impromptu
rare bird show.

1599
01:10:00,697 --> 01:10:02,732
The bird show.
The amazing bird show.

1600
01:10:02,832 --> 01:10:05,702
The wonderful bird show.
The bird show.

1601
01:10:07,003 --> 01:10:08,272
I don't have a lot
of time to say this,

1602
01:10:08,372 --> 01:10:10,206
but I've got to get
something off my chest.

1603
01:10:10,307 --> 01:10:12,842
Last night, my house
threw a party,

1604
01:10:12,942 --> 01:10:16,613
and I thought that we all
finally got along.

1605
01:10:16,713 --> 01:10:18,382
We had a good time.

1606
01:10:18,482 --> 01:10:21,184
But we got so many protests,
we broke so many rules,

1607
01:10:21,285 --> 01:10:23,253
that we got
booted off campus.

1608
01:10:23,353 --> 01:10:25,655
You know, it used to be
the administration's job

1609
01:10:25,755 --> 01:10:26,756
to make rules.

1610
01:10:26,856 --> 01:10:28,392
It used to be
us against them.

1611
01:10:28,492 --> 01:10:30,627
Now it's us against us.

1612
01:10:30,727 --> 01:10:33,229
I've been here for 7 years,
and I got to tell you guys,

1613
01:10:33,330 --> 01:10:36,600
what's going on here
is about America.

1614
01:10:36,700 --> 01:10:37,934
Shut up.

1615
01:10:38,034 --> 01:10:39,168
It's about democracy.

1616
01:10:39,269 --> 01:10:40,637
It's about
the Bill of Rights

1617
01:10:40,737 --> 01:10:42,906
and basic cable,
call-waiting,

1618
01:10:43,006 --> 01:10:44,474
and free trips
to the salad bar.

1619
01:10:44,574 --> 01:10:47,311
It's about everything that
makes this country great.

1620
01:10:47,411 --> 01:10:49,913
Our country!

1621
01:10:50,013 --> 01:10:52,749
We can do something
about this.

1622
01:10:52,849 --> 01:10:55,985
We can finally say...

1623
01:10:56,085 --> 01:10:59,489
that when some people
are having a good time,

1624
01:10:59,589 --> 01:11:01,691
and drinking some beers
and throwing some meat,

1625
01:11:01,791 --> 01:11:05,161
that we're not going
to protest.

1626
01:11:05,329 --> 01:11:08,164
In fact, I promised myself
I wouldn't do this.

1627
01:11:08,398 --> 01:11:09,799
I'm sorry.

1628
01:11:09,899 --> 01:11:13,837
If we could just say that,
if only to each other,

1629
01:11:13,937 --> 01:11:15,572
just this one time,

1630
01:11:15,672 --> 01:11:18,007
that we're not
gonna protest...

1631
01:11:24,881 --> 01:11:26,516
That we're not
gonna protest?

1632
01:11:26,616 --> 01:11:29,886
We're not
gonna protest!

1633
01:11:31,054 --> 01:11:32,856
We're not gonna protest!

1634
01:11:32,956 --> 01:11:34,791
We're not gonna protest!

1635
01:11:34,891 --> 01:11:36,826
We're not gonna protest!

1636
01:11:36,926 --> 01:11:38,795
We're not gonna protest!

1637
01:11:38,895 --> 01:11:40,630
We're not gonna protest!

1638
01:11:40,730 --> 01:11:42,499
We're not gonna protest!

1639
01:11:42,599 --> 01:11:43,967
We're not gonna protest!

1640
01:11:44,067 --> 01:11:45,969
We're not gonna protest!

1641
01:11:46,069 --> 01:11:47,904
We're not gonna protest!

1642
01:11:48,004 --> 01:11:49,373
We're not gonna protest!

1643
01:11:49,473 --> 01:11:51,508
This is not good.

1644
01:11:51,608 --> 01:11:52,942
This is really
not good.

1645
01:11:53,042 --> 01:11:55,512
We're not gonna protest!

1646
01:11:55,612 --> 01:11:57,246
We're not gonna protest!

1647
01:11:57,381 --> 01:11:59,483
Chant sheets!
Get your chant sheets.

1648
01:11:59,583 --> 01:12:00,450
Right here.

1649
01:12:00,550 --> 01:12:03,653
We got placards here.
Placards here.

1650
01:12:03,753 --> 01:12:05,455
OK. We got placards here.

1651
01:12:05,555 --> 01:12:07,857
Placards for everybody.

1652
01:12:08,792 --> 01:12:10,894
We brought our own.

1653
01:12:13,697 --> 01:12:16,466
We're not gonna protest!

1654
01:12:16,566 --> 01:12:19,068
Ladies and gentlemen,
please take your seats.

1655
01:12:19,168 --> 01:12:21,705
Everyone, please,
take your seats.

1656
01:12:21,805 --> 01:12:23,239
Be quiet!

1657
01:12:23,407 --> 01:12:25,809
I'm asking you to be quiet,
everyone.

1658
01:12:25,909 --> 01:12:28,978
Be quiet!

1659
01:12:29,078 --> 01:12:32,549
B.D., get us out of here
before they touch me.

1660
01:12:34,651 --> 01:12:35,619
Please take your seats.

1661
01:12:35,719 --> 01:12:36,986
Be quiet!

1662
01:12:37,086 --> 01:12:41,658
Thompson, your inability
to control the students

1663
01:12:41,758 --> 01:12:43,026
has convinced us
that you are

1664
01:12:43,126 --> 01:12:44,828
an ineffective
president.

1665
01:12:44,928 --> 01:12:47,030
What? What are you
talking about?

1666
01:12:47,130 --> 01:12:49,666
You're fired,
Thompson!

1667
01:12:49,766 --> 01:12:52,536
Dismissed,
booted, sacked,

1668
01:12:52,636 --> 01:12:53,803
history,
shit-canned,

1669
01:12:53,903 --> 01:12:54,838
out of here.

1670
01:12:54,938 --> 01:12:56,606
What are you doing?

1671
01:12:56,706 --> 01:12:57,941
B.D., go beat up
the pre-frosh.

1672
01:12:58,041 --> 01:12:59,443
The little kid?

1673
01:12:59,543 --> 01:13:03,513
He's a pit spy, you Neanderthal.
Go kick his ass.

1674
01:13:05,615 --> 01:13:06,950
Thanks, guys.

1675
01:13:07,050 --> 01:13:08,585
I feel much better now.

1676
01:13:08,685 --> 01:13:11,888
Oh, OK. Thank you.

1677
01:13:11,988 --> 01:13:12,989
We're not gonna protest!

1678
01:13:13,089 --> 01:13:15,559
Gutter is a tool!

1679
01:13:15,659 --> 01:13:16,893
Gutter is a tool!

1680
01:13:16,993 --> 01:13:19,663
We're not gonna protest!

1681
01:13:20,830 --> 01:13:23,066
Here's to Balls and Shaft!

1682
01:13:27,737 --> 01:13:29,005
I scheme and plan
for months,

1683
01:13:29,105 --> 01:13:30,339
and it all gets
screwed up

1684
01:13:30,474 --> 01:13:32,041
because you can't
control the students!

1685
01:13:32,141 --> 01:13:34,077
Never send a woman
to do a man's job!

1686
01:13:34,177 --> 01:13:36,746
You cocky, pointy-nosed
little Reaganite.

1687
01:13:36,846 --> 01:13:38,314
If you hadn't
provoked them,

1688
01:13:38,482 --> 01:13:39,883
we wouldn't be
in this mess.

1689
01:13:39,983 --> 01:13:42,486
Excuse me?
Reality check here.

1690
01:13:42,552 --> 01:13:43,687
Earth to tall bitch.

1691
01:13:43,787 --> 01:13:45,955
What is your fault?
This is.

1692
01:13:46,055 --> 01:13:49,058
Hey, poor boy,
go and have your parties

1693
01:13:49,158 --> 01:13:50,627
with all your
new friends.

1694
01:13:50,727 --> 01:13:52,061
I can see it now,
Andrews,

1695
01:13:52,161 --> 01:13:54,163
you and all the knee-jerk,
bleeding-heart liberals,

1696
01:13:54,263 --> 01:13:56,365
sipping tea
and playing patty cake

1697
01:13:56,500 --> 01:13:58,134
and those useless
hippie potheads,

1698
01:13:58,234 --> 01:13:59,603
those commie-pinko leftists,

1699
01:13:59,703 --> 01:14:02,506
the bunny huggers,
the pillow biters--

1700
01:14:02,572 --> 01:14:03,907
Which ones are
the pillow biters?

1701
01:14:04,007 --> 01:14:05,041
The butt-pirates.

1702
01:14:05,141 --> 01:14:07,110
And those beastly
man-haters.

1703
01:14:07,210 --> 01:14:08,311
Tell those chicks
to shave their pits

1704
01:14:08,545 --> 01:14:09,513
and call me.

1705
01:14:09,546 --> 01:14:11,915
The Goddamn whiny
cry-baby minorities,

1706
01:14:12,015 --> 01:14:15,151
you can
keep 'em all.

1707
01:14:15,251 --> 01:14:16,586
Rand McPherson, everybody.

1708
01:14:16,686 --> 01:14:17,854
Just remember the 9:30 show

1709
01:14:17,954 --> 01:14:19,823
is completely different
from the 7:30 show.

1710
01:14:19,923 --> 01:14:22,125
Enjoy the veal.

1711
01:14:24,928 --> 01:14:26,730
Come on!
Come on!

1712
01:14:32,569 --> 01:14:35,539
And in light of your valiant
actions to save this house,

1713
01:14:35,572 --> 01:14:37,406
we all think it's time
to take part

1714
01:14:37,541 --> 01:14:38,608
in the one tradition
left over

1715
01:14:38,708 --> 01:14:40,544
from the dark days
of Balls and Shaft.

1716
01:14:40,644 --> 01:14:43,547
Tom Lawrence,
prepare yourself...

1717
01:14:44,981 --> 01:14:46,683
for initiation.

1718
01:14:53,256 --> 01:14:56,960
Just try to relax.

1719
01:14:57,060 --> 01:14:58,962
Uh, Droz...

1720
01:14:59,062 --> 01:15:00,363
Yeah.

1721
01:15:00,597 --> 01:15:01,631
There's my bus.

1722
01:15:01,731 --> 01:15:03,833
Oh, man.

1723
01:15:04,968 --> 01:15:06,269
Damn!

1724
01:15:06,369 --> 01:15:08,805
We're just gonna have
to get you next year.

1725
01:15:11,775 --> 01:15:12,942
Don't let him
scare you.

1726
01:15:13,042 --> 01:15:15,478
It's only hurts
for a minute.

1727
01:15:15,579 --> 01:15:16,946
Hey, Gut man,
watch the stylings

1728
01:15:17,046 --> 01:15:18,648
on the youngster.

1729
01:15:21,918 --> 01:15:23,186
Nice.

1730
01:15:26,723 --> 01:15:27,857
I'll see ya.

1731
01:15:27,957 --> 01:15:29,392
Aw.
Oh.

1732
01:15:29,626 --> 01:15:30,694
In the fall.

1733
01:15:30,794 --> 01:15:33,096
Yeah!
Yeah!

1734
01:15:34,130 --> 01:15:35,431
All right,
little half-chunk.

1735
01:15:35,665 --> 01:15:37,901
Bye, Tom.

1736
01:15:50,947 --> 01:15:52,882
Hey, Cecilia.
Wait up.

1737
01:15:56,152 --> 01:15:57,286
Am I interrupting
anything?

1738
01:15:57,386 --> 01:15:59,823
Oh, no. We were
just rehearsing.

1739
01:15:59,923 --> 01:16:01,424
The Nutcracker.

1740
01:16:01,658 --> 01:16:02,458
Really?

1741
01:16:02,692 --> 01:16:03,860
Yeah, on ice.

1742
01:16:04,961 --> 01:16:06,129
Should be
pretty decent

1743
01:16:06,229 --> 01:16:07,764
once we get Gutter
up on skates.

1744
01:16:07,864 --> 01:16:09,999
God, I think I'd actually
pay to see that.

1745
01:16:10,099 --> 01:16:12,135
You would?

1746
01:16:12,235 --> 01:16:13,803
Let's get out of here.
You and I.

1747
01:16:13,903 --> 01:16:16,005
Seriously.
Just hit the road.

1748
01:16:16,105 --> 01:16:18,307
Actually, I was thinking

1749
01:16:18,407 --> 01:16:21,444
more along the lines
of a cup of coffee.

1750
01:16:21,678 --> 01:16:22,646
A cup of coffee?

1751
01:16:22,712 --> 01:16:23,847
Yeah.

1752
01:16:25,248 --> 01:16:26,883
Let's do that.

1753
01:16:31,387 --> 01:16:32,989
Hey, let's drive down.

1754
01:16:33,089 --> 01:16:35,191
Indeed, driving
for coffee.

1755
01:16:35,291 --> 01:16:36,826
We don't have a car.

1756
01:16:36,926 --> 01:16:39,162
I do.
For the weekend, anyway.

1757
01:16:39,262 --> 01:16:43,399
My aunt lent me
her red BMW convertible.

1758
01:16:43,667 --> 01:16:44,768
