1
00:00:32,966 --> 00:00:35,366
Bill?

2
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:40,133
Bill?

3
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:43,971
Are you in there?

4
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:53,641
I feel I have a great deal of promise.

5
00:01:53,746 --> 00:01:56,146
- Promise?
- Yes, unlimited potential.

6
00:01:56,249 --> 00:01:59,650
- I graduated near the top of my class.
- Uh-huh.

7
00:01:59,752 --> 00:02:02,346
I see you've been out of school
for a year already.

8
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:05,720
Well, okay, yes. But I think
that's a little misleading.

9
00:02:05,825 --> 00:02:09,522
I look at this past year
as a period of real growth for me...

10
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:12,723
in terms of preparation
for the future.

11
00:02:12,832 --> 00:02:16,962
- What are your goals?
- Goals? You mean
in terms of architecture?

12
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:19,630
Where do you see yourself,
let's say, five years from now?

13
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:22,139
Oh. Well, um...

14
00:02:22,242 --> 00:02:26,144
It would be great to get this job
so I can get out of my mom's house.

15
00:02:27,514 --> 00:02:29,982
No. Five years from now.

16
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:33,143
I'd have to say...

17
00:02:33,253 --> 00:02:37,349
Well on my way, sir.
That's where I see myself.

18
00:02:37,457 --> 00:02:39,948
I see a lot of room
for me to grow here,

19
00:02:40,059 --> 00:02:43,153
and I don't want you to concern
yourself with this past year.

20
00:02:43,263 --> 00:02:45,993
I'm the first to admit
I had a little difficulty...

21
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:48,226
just as far as
forward momentum,

22
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:52,930
but I've had a lot
of job interviews recently,
and I don't want to say anything,

23
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:56,167
but I feel like I'm on the verge
of a real breakthrough, I really do.

24
00:02:56,276 --> 00:02:59,643
And I think big things
are gonna happen.

25
00:03:01,614 --> 00:03:05,311
Well, I'm certainly
on your side, Tim.

26
00:03:05,418 --> 00:03:07,318
- Tom.
- Tom.

27
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:09,445
Tom Thompson.

28
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:29,407
Hello?

29
00:03:34,847 --> 00:03:36,747
Tom!

30
00:03:39,485 --> 00:03:41,578
Tom!

31
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,760
Tom!

32
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:56,601
- Phone call.
- Who is it?

33
00:03:56,703 --> 00:03:59,729
It's a girl.

34
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:01,739
- Hey, what's this friggin' lock?
- Not now.

35
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:03,672
Hey!

36
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:10,110
- Hello?
- Is this Tom?

37
00:04:10,216 --> 00:04:13,117
Tom Thompson?

38
00:04:14,821 --> 00:04:19,554
- Who is this?
- It's Ruth Abernathy, Bill's mom.

39
00:04:19,659 --> 00:04:24,528
Bill's... dead.

40
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:42,966
- I have to talk to you.
I'm, like, shaking.
- Did you get the job?

41
00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:46,512
- Do you remember a guy
named Bill Abernathy?
- No. So you didn't get the job.

42
00:05:46,612 --> 00:05:49,672
This has nothing to do with the job.
Come on, think. From high school?

43
00:05:49,782 --> 00:05:52,342
- Look, I don't remember him.
Are you okay?
- No?

44
00:05:52,452 --> 00:05:55,285
- Is that your Brooks Brothers?
- I had to do some research at the firm.

45
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:58,551
- You can't bowl in your Brooks Brothers.
- Where's Brad?

46
00:05:58,658 --> 00:06:01,354
He's on the phone.
He won't get off.

47
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:05,363
Glass. Brad Glass.
Right, from Brooklyn.

48
00:06:05,465 --> 00:06:07,899
No, no, no,
United States.

49
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,333
Sorry to wake you.
What time there?

50
00:06:11,437 --> 00:06:14,497
He's been trying
to reach that guy in Japan
about that stupid dog breeding thing.

51
00:06:14,607 --> 00:06:18,065
- We have to talk to you. Hang up.
- Miss Tsumaki. Miss Tsumaki!

52
00:06:18,177 --> 00:06:21,010
Six dollars a minute,
this woman keeps putting me on hold.

53
00:06:21,114 --> 00:06:23,412
- Did you get the job?
- Get off. I have to talk to you.

54
00:06:23,516 --> 00:06:26,576
- Is that your Brooks Brothers?
- Do you remember
a guy named Bill Abernathy?

55
00:06:26,686 --> 00:06:29,587
- Miss Tsumaki?
- What happened at the interview?

56
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:32,590
- They claim they're gonna call me.
- Hello? Hello? Listen.

57
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:35,593
Very important. I need feedback
from husband about business proposal.

58
00:06:35,695 --> 00:06:38,129
- Can he call back?
I have him call you back.
- Chihuahua.

59
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:40,290
- Okay. I call back.
- Yeah, call back.

60
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,300
- I call back.
- Call back.

61
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:45,303
- Okay. Bye-bye. Bye!
- Good-bye. 'Bye.

62
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:49,307
Listen, I'm trying to run
a business here. That's a business call.

63
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:54,142
I'm sorry to interrupt your business
call, but Bill Abernathy is dead.

64
00:06:55,548 --> 00:06:58,176
Who's Bill Abernathy?

65
00:06:58,284 --> 00:07:01,549
Before I get the chance to tell
this very mysterious-sounding woman...

66
00:07:01,654 --> 00:07:04,555
that I basically have
no recollection of her son,

67
00:07:04,657 --> 00:07:07,057
- she just starts crying.
- She cried?

68
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,560
- Jesus, who is this woman?
- I don't know.

69
00:07:09,662 --> 00:07:13,462
But there were these long stretches,
nothing but crying, for like minutes.

70
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:19,367
I feel really bad for the lady.

71
00:07:19,472 --> 00:07:22,373
She sounds like
a nice, warm person.

72
00:07:27,346 --> 00:07:30,179
- So I guess I'm gonna need a suit.
- For what?

73
00:07:30,249 --> 00:07:33,218
Hello? What have we been talking
about? I'm gonna be a pallbearer.

74
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:35,446
- What?
- You didn't get out of it?

75
00:07:35,555 --> 00:07:38,888
Are you done laughing? This is
my whole point. I'm in big trouble.

76
00:07:38,991 --> 00:07:41,687
- How could you tell her "yes"?
- I told you, there was crying.

77
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:43,694
How am I supposed to
respond to that?

78
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:45,730
Call her up.
Tell her you got back trouble.

79
00:07:45,832 --> 00:07:47,732
It's no good.
I am in, I am committed.

80
00:07:47,834 --> 00:07:50,064
I am just gonna have to
do this one little thing for her.

81
00:07:50,169 --> 00:07:53,764
It starts off as
one little thing, all of a sudden
you're enmeshed in a situation.

82
00:07:53,873 --> 00:07:57,434
- This could be part
of a whole scam operation.
- What?

83
00:07:57,543 --> 00:08:02,344
One minute you're
carrying this guy's coffin,
the next you're lying in a ditch naked.

84
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:11,916
- Is that suit black?
- No, it's a charcoal gray weave
with a chalk stripe. Why?

85
00:08:13,526 --> 00:08:15,960
- What are you, 40 regular?
Scott, please.
- No, no.

86
00:08:16,062 --> 00:08:18,292
I wear this suit to work.
This is my main work suit.

87
00:08:18,397 --> 00:08:20,388
I have a problem here.
I have to look presentable.

88
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,434
This is a $600 suit.

89
00:08:24,203 --> 00:08:26,603
- Now I'm starting to see you
for who you really are.
- Come on.

90
00:08:26,706 --> 00:08:29,197
No, I'm serious. What if it were Brad
lying in the coffin?

91
00:08:29,308 --> 00:08:31,503
Whoa! What are you
talkin' about, "Brad"?

92
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:34,512
Hey, all the shit you eat,
your heart's a time bomb.

93
00:08:34,614 --> 00:08:38,345
That's nice. That's a nice thing.
I've had enough. I gotta go.

94
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:42,182
- What do you mean? We're not done here.
- Hey, it's 10:30.

95
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:44,415
So? It's Tuesday night.
Can you believe him?

96
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,515
It's 10:30 already?

97
00:08:48,594 --> 00:08:50,494
Come on, let's go.

98
00:08:50,596 --> 00:08:53,224
If you don't lend me the suit,
Scott, I can't do it, I can't go.

99
00:08:53,332 --> 00:08:56,859
- I'll have to call her back.
- That's good.
You don't need this right now.

100
00:08:56,969 --> 00:08:59,301
- And don't forget the wedding shower.
- Oh, yeah. I'm not going.

101
00:08:59,405 --> 00:09:01,669
- You're going. You're the best man.
- No.

102
00:09:01,774 --> 00:09:05,369
How can he marry her?
She's like an albatross around his neck.

103
00:09:05,478 --> 00:09:07,878
You don't understand.
It's called a relationship.

104
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,880
Oh, what?
Cynthia's an albatross.

105
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:17,015
Bring some wine, okay?

106
00:09:17,123 --> 00:09:19,023
You better come.

107
00:09:49,455 --> 00:09:52,652
- Cynthia. Hi.
- Oh, hi!

108
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:55,056
Oh, my God, you'll
never believe who's coming.

109
00:09:55,161 --> 00:09:58,619
- How could you invite Jared Schneidman?
- Just relax and you'll be fine.

110
00:09:58,731 --> 00:10:01,666
- Why?
- Is that what you're wearing?

111
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:04,133
Of course, it's what I'm wearing.
We're here.

112
00:10:04,236 --> 00:10:06,101
- Wait. Who's coming?
- Now, don't panic.

113
00:10:06,205 --> 00:10:09,106
- I'm not.
- Good. I ran into her
at D'Agostino's this morning.

114
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:11,676
- Cynthia!
- Who?
- Hi!

115
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:14,075
- Who?
- I'll be right back.

116
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,239
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, Cynthia, come o...

117
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:19,250
- There's a lot
of single women here tonight.

118
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:21,252
- Who's coming, Scott?
- What are you talking about?

119
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:23,254
Cynthia said someone is coming.

120
00:10:23,356 --> 00:10:26,291
It's not that Loretta person, is it?
Because that did not work out.

121
00:10:26,392 --> 00:10:28,292
- Sweetheart...
- Shut up!

122
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:31,488
What the f...
That is not good dip!

123
00:10:31,597 --> 00:10:33,497
Oh, gee. There she goes again.

124
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:37,467
Do you see how she,
like, spits?

125
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:39,697
...before you listen to me, Brad.
- Sweetheart...

126
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:42,205
- Shut up with the "sweetheart"!
- I don't understand.

127
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:44,776
You haven't the vaguest...

128
00:10:46,545 --> 00:10:49,639
Isn't that Julie DeMarco?

129
00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:53,617
- I have to borrow a shirt.
- How many times do I have to tell you...

130
00:10:53,719 --> 00:10:56,051
- What are you doing?
- That's Julie DeMarco out there.

131
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:59,181
Don't you have any regular shirts?
Like, just a shirt?

132
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:01,191
What are you talking about?

133
00:11:01,293 --> 00:11:04,228
Like that. That's a good shirt.
Don't you have any shirts like that?

134
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,764
- Yeah, I'm wearing it.
- Take it off.

135
00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:08,766
- What?
- I have to borrow the shirt, Scott.

136
00:11:08,868 --> 00:11:12,929
- What is this obsessión
with my clothes?
- I was in love with her, okay?

137
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:15,940
- So?
- "So"? So I haven't
seen her since high school.

138
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:19,637
Imagine that she sees me
and I'm wearing the same fuckin' shirt!

139
00:11:21,414 --> 00:11:24,611
Look, I just got this shirt.

140
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:39,557
- Guys.
- He wants to borrow my shirt now.

141
00:11:39,665 --> 00:11:42,259
Whatever. We gotta
do something about the dip.

142
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:44,336
Lauren's having a frigging
conniption out there.

143
00:11:44,437 --> 00:11:47,235
Did you leave your answering machine
on? I gave Tsumaki the phone number.

144
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:50,502
I got a line on a couple
of prize-winning dogs.

145
00:11:50,609 --> 00:11:54,943
- What's wrong with the dip?
- Lauren's sisters are
all lactose-intolerant.

146
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:58,608
"Lactose"?
Don't marry her, Brad.

147
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:02,179
- Lauren...
- He doesn't care. Julie, Julie.

148
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:05,916
Is it too much to ask that I could have
one dip for me and my sisters to enjoy?

149
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:09,017
- What about salsa?
- Salsa! I love... I love salsa.

150
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:13,861
T... Tom! You remember Julie DeMarco.
She's back in Brooklyn.

151
00:12:13,966 --> 00:12:18,426
Oh! Hi, sure, yes.
Didn't you move away senior year?

152
00:12:18,537 --> 00:12:22,098
- Yeah, Long Island.
- Her father made
a killing in real estate.

153
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:26,736
Julie's right.
Salsa, guacamole. It is so obvious.

154
00:12:26,846 --> 00:12:30,304
You know what? I think I have
some avocado in the kitchen.

155
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,407
- Let's take a look.
- I just want to tell you one thing.

156
00:12:34,153 --> 00:12:37,884
- Did you ever think salsa or guacamole?
- Okay.

157
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:40,652
So, you... Wow.
You look, uh, really...

158
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,627
Oh, God.
Well, that's really...

159
00:12:43,729 --> 00:12:45,697
Hey, Mary Lou!

160
00:12:45,798 --> 00:12:49,131
God! Jared Schneidman?

161
00:12:49,235 --> 00:12:51,760
I-I know.
D-Do you know he's engaged?

162
00:12:51,871 --> 00:12:56,001
He is not! Oh, my God!

163
00:12:56,108 --> 00:13:00,374
- Everybody's getting married.
- I know! It's like
a virus or something.

164
00:13:00,479 --> 00:13:03,505
I know. I mean, I was,
you know, supposed to, but...

165
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:07,643
- Oh.
- You know, it didn't work out.
But, yeah...

166
00:13:07,753 --> 00:13:11,655
But I thought for sure you would
have been snatched up by now.

167
00:13:11,757 --> 00:13:15,420
Oh...
So you remember me?

168
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:18,622
Tom! What,
are you kidding?

169
00:13:18,731 --> 00:13:21,256
So you think I would
have been snatched up, huh?

170
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:24,302
Well, you know, a lot of giris
were, uh, after you.

171
00:13:24,403 --> 00:13:26,303
- No.
- Yes.

172
00:13:26,405 --> 00:13:28,669
- No.
- Yes!

173
00:13:28,774 --> 00:13:30,674
- What about that girl?
- Who?

174
00:13:30,776 --> 00:13:34,405
Oh, you know, uh, Shelly.
Shelly What's-Her-Name. She loved you.

175
00:13:34,513 --> 00:13:37,038
- I have no idea
who you're talking about.
- Yes, you do.

176
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:40,175
Remember, you guys did that play,
that musical together?

177
00:13:40,286 --> 00:13:43,983
- Musical? No, I don't...
- Yeah, you were great.
You had a great voice.

178
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:46,785
I don't... sing.

179
00:13:46,892 --> 00:13:50,055
What do you mean?

180
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:55,190
I'm Tom Thompson.
We were in band together.

181
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:00,935
Oh.

182
00:14:05,978 --> 00:14:09,812
- You okay?
- Please, I'm fine.

183
00:14:09,915 --> 00:14:14,545
This is good. It's time you let go
of Julie DeMarco, just move past her.

184
00:14:14,653 --> 00:14:18,419
So I've decided. You should
ask Julie DeMarco out for coffee.

185
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:22,221
She's one of the sweetest people
I have ever, ever known.

186
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:25,661
Yeah, Tom, did you see those legs?
Forget about it.

187
00:14:25,764 --> 00:14:28,665
- You were staring at her legs?
- No, not for me, for Tom.

188
00:14:28,767 --> 00:14:30,735
- I can't believe you.
- What?

189
00:14:30,836 --> 00:14:32,736
You should be staring at my legs.

190
00:14:32,838 --> 00:14:35,102
I've been staring
at your legs for nine years.

191
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:37,835
What are you saying?
You're tired of my legs?

192
00:14:37,943 --> 00:14:39,843
No, Cynthia,
I'm agreeing with you.

193
00:14:39,945 --> 00:14:42,038
I'm saying that Tom should ask
Julie DeMarco out for coffee.

194
00:14:42,147 --> 00:14:44,308
- Don't you think he should?
- Yes!

195
00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:49,244
Are you okay?

196
00:14:49,355 --> 00:14:51,255
Please, I'm fine.

197
00:15:35,134 --> 00:15:37,568
How was the party?

198
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,570
It was okay.

199
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:44,300
Gonna see your father on Sunday?

200
00:15:46,712 --> 00:15:48,703
I don't know, Ma.

201
00:15:51,884 --> 00:15:54,682
Anything new?

202
00:15:57,089 --> 00:15:58,989
Good night, Ma.

203
00:16:01,827 --> 00:16:03,727
See ya tomorrow.

204
00:16:43,902 --> 00:16:46,234
Ohh.

205
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:00,484
Tom.

206
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,955
I got in touch
with Jimmy Gold.

207
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:18,060
He's coming down
from Boston.

208
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:22,072
And then the cousins
from Jersey.

209
00:17:22,174 --> 00:17:27,703
Maybe, you know,
a friend from the gym.

210
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:30,646
We might be one or two short
on the pallbearers.

211
00:17:34,686 --> 00:17:36,984
Mrs. Abernathy,
I am really sorry.

212
00:17:37,089 --> 00:17:39,922
I wish there was something
I could do to help you out.

213
00:17:51,203 --> 00:17:53,103
I know how you feel.

214
00:17:57,443 --> 00:18:00,412
You do?

215
00:18:03,015 --> 00:18:04,915
- I'm giving the eulogy.
- What?

216
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:08,248
- Ruth Abernathy came to my house.
- Jesus, you didn't get out of it?

217
00:18:08,353 --> 00:18:11,049
- You're getting enmeshed.
- Are you having a thing?

218
00:18:11,156 --> 00:18:14,785
Tom, don't get upset.
Brad and Lauren just stopped by.

219
00:18:14,893 --> 00:18:17,123
- It's not like a thing thing.
- Is that lasagna?

220
00:18:19,198 --> 00:18:24,135
- I can't believe you people.
It's just like a conspiracy.
- No, it's not!

221
00:18:24,236 --> 00:18:27,535
- If you must know, this was my idea.
- Oh, your idea.

222
00:18:27,639 --> 00:18:30,130
- We're two couples having dinner.
- I need to be a couple now.

223
00:18:30,242 --> 00:18:33,678
- Not everything's about you, Tom.
- That's right. It's all about you...

224
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:36,475
and your sisters and all
your dietary restrictions.

225
00:18:36,582 --> 00:18:38,482
All right, that's it!
I've had your shit...

226
00:18:38,584 --> 00:18:40,575
- Let's go. I'm ready for you now.
- Relax.

227
00:18:40,686 --> 00:18:42,916
- Get you a drink, Tom?
- Yes, you can, Cynthia.

228
00:18:43,021 --> 00:18:46,184
- And some lasagna. Thank you.
- Take it easy.

229
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:51,990
I don't know.
What about the chess club? Can't
we do anything with the chess club?

230
00:18:52,097 --> 00:18:53,997
It should be personal.
I mean, you loved the guy.

231
00:18:54,099 --> 00:18:56,260
- I did not love the guy.
- Maybe you traveled together.

232
00:18:56,368 --> 00:18:58,268
Yeah, excellent!
Scott, read that back.

233
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:00,497
Okay. "Chess. You loved him.
Traveled together."

234
00:19:00,606 --> 00:19:03,666
- Okay. We are on our way.
- You traveled together playing chess.

235
00:19:03,775 --> 00:19:05,800
- Yes! Yes!
- Through China.

236
00:19:05,911 --> 00:19:09,711
You played chess in China
and then you fell in love.

237
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:11,715
See, that doesn't help.

238
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:15,378
You don't know this Ruth Abernathy
person. She means business.

239
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:18,684
- So, Scott, you're
coming with me, right?

240
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:20,951
- What, to the funeral? No.
- Scott!

241
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:23,027
How about giving
a little moral support?

242
00:19:23,128 --> 00:19:25,028
- Yeah, Scott, I need some moral support.
- Don't worry.

243
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:27,724
- I'll support you, Tom.
- Just Scott.

244
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:30,358
- Hi. How are you?
- It's Julie DeMarco.

245
00:19:30,469 --> 00:19:32,994
What, she just
comes over now?

246
00:19:33,105 --> 00:19:37,906
Hi. I'm sorry I missed
the lasagna, but I got... Anyway.

247
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:41,776
Here are the magazines
we were talking about.

248
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:46,544
- So. What's going on?
- We're writing a eulogy.

249
00:19:46,652 --> 00:19:51,146
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Don't worry. We didn't know the guy.

250
00:19:51,256 --> 00:19:54,487
You guys are going to someone's funeral
who you don't know?

251
00:19:54,593 --> 00:19:56,788
- Actually, they're not going. I'm going.
- Scott and I are going.

252
00:19:56,895 --> 00:20:00,888
- Why don't you come too?
- You're inviting me to a funeral?

253
00:20:00,999 --> 00:20:03,160
- Yes!
It's not like it's a real funeral.

254
00:20:03,268 --> 00:20:06,294
- It is! It's a funeral.
- If she's going, I'm allowed to go.

255
00:20:06,405 --> 00:20:08,305
- She is not going.
- Typical bullshit.

256
00:20:08,407 --> 00:20:10,375
- Tom!
- It's okay.

257
00:20:10,475 --> 00:20:15,310
Obviously, Tom does not want me to go
to this funeral thing and that's fine.

258
00:20:15,414 --> 00:20:19,214
- I have nothing against you
going personally...
- All right, we're all going.

259
00:20:19,318 --> 00:20:21,912
No, no, no.
Only if it's okay with Tom.

260
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:25,148
- Tom, is it okay?
- Is it okay, Tom? Come on.

261
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:02,420
- That's the dead guy's mother?
- Uh-huh.

262
00:21:02,527 --> 00:21:04,427
Jesus.

263
00:21:20,812 --> 00:21:22,712
Thank you.

264
00:21:44,036 --> 00:21:48,700
Excuse me. My condolences.
Who will perform the eulogy?

265
00:21:51,076 --> 00:21:55,137
The tall young man with
the dark suit and hair. Tom Thompson.

266
00:21:55,247 --> 00:21:57,977
Thank you so much.

267
00:22:38,757 --> 00:22:40,657
Ring any bells?

268
00:22:42,994 --> 00:22:44,894
No.

269
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:52,197
Mr. Thompson,
if you would please, sir.

270
00:22:54,906 --> 00:22:56,806
Good luck.

271
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,858
Who is Bill Abernathy?

272
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:31,868
This is not
an easy question to answer.

273
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:39,868
I could spend countless hours
recounting my personal experiences...

274
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:41,878
with Bill.

275
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:51,888
The chess club.

276
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:55,721
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

277
00:25:03,735 --> 00:25:06,636
Instead I ask,

278
00:25:06,738 --> 00:25:10,299
who is the real Bill Abernathy?

279
00:25:13,111 --> 00:25:16,444
What is the single...

280
00:25:16,548 --> 00:25:21,212
elusive, intangible,
inner quality...

281
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:23,253
that makes... made...

282
00:25:28,126 --> 00:25:30,026
Bill...

283
00:25:30,128 --> 00:25:32,688
Shh.

284
00:25:34,466 --> 00:25:36,366
Bill.

285
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:44,541
Well, folks, I don't...

286
00:25:44,643 --> 00:25:46,941
I don't have that answer.

287
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:49,445
Who really does?

288
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,867
Shh.

289
00:26:20,946 --> 00:26:22,846
Pull ahead.

290
00:26:22,948 --> 00:26:25,781
- I got it.
- All right.

291
00:26:25,884 --> 00:26:28,978
Here we go.

292
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:32,454
- So, you guys, I don't think
this is funny, all right?
- We don't think it's funny.

293
00:26:32,557 --> 00:26:35,856
- We weren't laughing.
- Yes, you were.
I can't, you know...

294
00:26:35,961 --> 00:26:39,021
- That was a sneeze.
- I don't think it's funny.
I just don't understand.

295
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:41,530
We weren't laughing.

296
00:26:44,169 --> 00:26:46,797
I'll see you all later.

297
00:26:46,905 --> 00:26:50,306
I don't feel like staying.
I'm very... I'm gonna go.

298
00:26:55,246 --> 00:26:57,646
Julie! Julie!

299
00:26:57,749 --> 00:27:00,411
- Ohh!
- Come right this way, please.

300
00:27:00,518 --> 00:27:03,976
- Julie! Where are you goin'?
- Come on, I'm losing him!
What are you doing?

301
00:27:04,089 --> 00:27:06,080
- Julie!
- Come on! Hey, hey, wait!

302
00:27:06,191 --> 00:27:09,490
Where... Where are you going?

303
00:27:09,594 --> 00:27:11,926
- What are you doing?
- Where are you going?

304
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:15,488
- I'm leaving. This isn't funny.
- I know. I felt terrible.

305
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,500
So, you remember him?

306
00:27:17,602 --> 00:27:20,298
- What?
- I saw you in the chapel.
You were crying.

307
00:27:20,405 --> 00:27:22,305
Hey, buddy,
are you kidding with this?

308
00:27:22,407 --> 00:27:25,604
Do you mind?
We're about to bury this guy.

309
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:28,838
This is a person.
This is a person's life.

310
00:27:30,949 --> 00:27:33,008
I don't remember him.

311
00:27:33,118 --> 00:27:36,451
- Oh.
- Hey, what's goin' on over there?

312
00:27:36,554 --> 00:27:39,318
It was just so, so sad.

313
00:27:39,424 --> 00:27:42,154
I don't know what the hell he's doing.

314
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:44,160
- Do you wanna get some coffee?
- Unbelievable.

315
00:27:44,262 --> 00:27:46,162
- He's pickin' up chicks.
- Coffee?

316
00:27:46,264 --> 00:27:49,461
Yeah. If you wouldn't mind.

317
00:27:49,567 --> 00:27:52,229
- Yeah, all right.
Why don't you call me?
- C-Call you?

318
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:54,828
- Get him off.
- All right, let's go.

319
00:27:54,939 --> 00:27:59,137
- Whoa!
- All right, all right.
Come on, back it up.

320
00:28:04,649 --> 00:28:07,743
I never should've asked you
to be a pallbearer.

321
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:10,047
It was too much for you.

322
00:28:10,155 --> 00:28:13,056
- There's a will.
- What?

323
00:28:13,158 --> 00:28:15,490
You're in the will.

324
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:21,321
All the way in.

325
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:41,716
Hello?

326
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,720
- Julie, hi.
- Hi.

327
00:28:43,822 --> 00:28:46,586
- Hi, it's Tom Thompson.
- Oh. Tom.

328
00:28:46,691 --> 00:28:48,386
- Hi. How are you?
- I'm fine.

329
00:28:48,493 --> 00:28:53,260
So listen, um, I was calling
because we've talked about din... um...

330
00:28:53,364 --> 00:28:55,264
- Uh...
- What did we talk about?

331
00:28:55,366 --> 00:29:00,235
- Did we, at the funeral,
talk about doing this, uh...
- Right, right.

332
00:29:00,338 --> 00:29:02,704
- The coffee thing.
- Yes!

333
00:29:02,807 --> 00:29:05,207
- Um, listen, I was thinking...
- Yeah?

334
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:07,778
What if Scott and Cynthia come along?

335
00:29:07,879 --> 00:29:10,439
- Scott and Cynthia?
- Yeah.

336
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:15,542
- Oh, you mean like a, uh...
- Yeah, you know, like the four of us.

337
00:29:15,653 --> 00:29:18,952
- Tom!
- 'Cause I'm seeing Cynthia
on Tuesday anyway.

338
00:29:19,057 --> 00:29:21,389
- Tu... On Tuesday?
- Tom!

339
00:29:21,493 --> 00:29:23,654
- Who was that?
- Huh? Oh, it's, uh... it's ju...

340
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:27,459
- This crazy woman...
Jesus, this neighborhood is...

341
00:29:27,565 --> 00:29:30,864
Hey, lady, you wanna keep it down?
I am on the phone here!

342
00:29:30,969 --> 00:29:34,370
Are you on the phone?
- Hello.

343
00:29:34,472 --> 00:29:36,872
- Hello?
- Hello?

344
00:29:36,975 --> 00:29:39,637
Who is this? Hello?

345
00:29:39,744 --> 00:29:41,644
Jesus.

346
00:29:41,746 --> 00:29:43,646
Tom?

347
00:29:43,748 --> 00:29:46,114
Oh, my God. Tom?

348
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:49,352
Uh, hel...

349
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:51,354
...Ulie?
- H-Hello?

350
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:53,390
- Julie? Julie?
- Hi! Hi!

351
00:29:53,491 --> 00:29:55,891
Wh... Well, that was weir...
What was that?

352
00:29:55,994 --> 00:29:58,895
lt... Did...
D- Did you... That was really creepy.

353
00:29:58,997 --> 00:30:02,489
- She just kept saying "hello."
Did you hear her?
- No. Didn't you hear me?

354
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:05,501
- Y... No.
- No? I w... Well, I was calling you.

355
00:30:05,603 --> 00:30:07,537
Were you trying to contact me?

356
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:09,539
Uh, y-y-yeah.

357
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:12,041
I ke... I kept saying "Julie."

358
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:15,704
Didn't... It must've been
a weird party line thing.

359
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:17,714
- That has never happened before.
- Huh.

360
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:20,148
So listen,
Tuesday is bowling night.

361
00:30:20,251 --> 00:30:22,719
- Oh.
- Uh, how about Thursday?

362
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:24,789
Great.

363
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:36,699
Oh, no,
I- I can't take his car.

364
00:30:36,801 --> 00:30:38,701
Look at this mess.

365
00:30:38,803 --> 00:30:40,703
Mrs. Abernathy.

366
00:30:40,805 --> 00:30:44,138
- Take it. He wanted you to have it.
- No, really, I can't.

367
00:30:45,543 --> 00:30:49,240
I gotta get it out of here.
Please.

368
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:54,743
Twenty-five-year-old kid
makes out a will.

369
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:57,253
I should've known right then.

370
00:30:57,355 --> 00:31:01,257
I brought you some, uh...
nut clusters.

371
00:31:03,494 --> 00:31:05,394
They're my favorite.

372
00:31:06,798 --> 00:31:09,028
Oh, Tom.

373
00:31:09,133 --> 00:31:11,533
I'm sorry about the funeral.

374
00:31:11,636 --> 00:31:13,536
So...

375
00:31:13,638 --> 00:31:16,198
how are you doing?

376
00:31:16,307 --> 00:31:18,207
I'm fine, I'm...

377
00:31:22,146 --> 00:31:24,205
I'm gonna be.
Thank you.

378
00:31:28,152 --> 00:31:31,053
Maybe I should just
have them take it all away.

379
00:31:31,155 --> 00:31:34,056
- Oh, here, here.
Let me help you with that.
- Thanks.

380
00:31:34,158 --> 00:31:37,559
I gotta get it all out of here
if I'm gonna sell this place.

381
00:31:37,662 --> 00:31:39,562
Oh, you're gonna
sell the house?

382
00:31:39,664 --> 00:31:42,895
Yeah. You know, maybe
it's too big for one person.

383
00:31:43,001 --> 00:31:44,901
Too quiet.

384
00:31:45,003 --> 00:31:48,370
I mean, it's like I have
the TV on all the time now.

385
00:31:48,473 --> 00:31:51,704
Thank you. It's very nice to have
someone to help out around here.

386
00:31:51,809 --> 00:31:53,709
Oh, sure.

387
00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:01,746
Who knows? You know,
I was thinking, maybe, of going
to one of those computer schools.

388
00:32:01,853 --> 00:32:04,651
Oh, yeah, computers.
That's good.

389
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:06,656
You think so?

390
00:32:10,328 --> 00:32:13,229
I'm gonna have to go through
Bill's stuff in his room.

391
00:32:15,967 --> 00:32:18,868
- I wish I could help you out.
- Oh, no, no.

392
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:21,370
I mean, it's just that
I'm... I'm very busy.

393
00:32:21,472 --> 00:32:24,873
- I mean, I got a job interview.
- Oh, a job interview.

394
00:32:24,976 --> 00:32:27,536
Yeah. Actually it's a second interview.

395
00:32:27,645 --> 00:32:29,545
I bet you get it.

396
00:32:29,647 --> 00:32:31,547
Thank you.

397
00:32:31,649 --> 00:32:34,015
I hope so.
I'm a little worried.

398
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:36,814
Do you mind if
I make a suggestion?

399
00:32:36,921 --> 00:32:40,220
- Sure.
- Why don't you try pushing
your hair back over your forehead.

400
00:32:40,325 --> 00:32:43,226
You know, like the other afternoon.
Like... Yeah, like that.

401
00:32:43,328 --> 00:32:45,228
Just...

402
00:32:47,231 --> 00:32:51,099
You don't let 'em see your face.
You're a good-looking man.

403
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:56,539
Well, maybe I'll let you
know how the interview goes.

404
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:58,541
I mean, if you're interested.

405
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:02,636
- Sure. If you have enough time,
you can drop by.
- Yeah, if I have the time.

406
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:24,363
- Whoa! My God, look at you.
- He's turned a corner.

407
00:33:24,469 --> 00:33:28,030
Oh, very important. I sort of mentioned
that I live on my own, okay?

408
00:33:28,139 --> 00:33:31,040
- So just don't blow it.
- You lied to her?

409
00:33:31,142 --> 00:33:34,077
- No, she seemed to have
a thing about it.
- So what are we supposed to say?

410
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:37,079
- Oh, this is it!
- What are we supposed to do at the end?

411
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:40,082
- Cynthia and I are going for cocktails?
- A late movie.

412
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:44,621
- You guys say you have plans
to see a late movie, then just go.
- How are we getting home?

413
00:33:44,722 --> 00:33:47,122
Deal with it.
I need the car.

414
00:33:47,225 --> 00:33:50,126
He's gotta drive her home.
That's the whole point.

415
00:33:50,228 --> 00:33:53,129
Could you give me an opening for
the story about Brad and the oranges?

416
00:33:53,231 --> 00:33:55,290
- Tom, just be yourself.
- Yeah, you're right.

417
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:58,699
- Scott, you set me up
with the orange story.
- You got it.

418
00:34:05,276 --> 00:34:08,768
Wait, wait, wait.
Wh... What was it?

419
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,780
- Uh, "Mean To Me," maybe?
- No, no!

420
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:14,818
- Louis Armstrong did
a great versión of it too.
- Oh! Oh, oh, oh. Uh...

421
00:34:14,919 --> 00:34:17,080
It goes:
# Dah dah-dah dah-dah #

422
00:34:17,188 --> 00:34:19,918
# Dah dah-dah dah-dah
Dah dah-dah dah-dah #

423
00:34:20,024 --> 00:34:23,585
- # Dah dah-dah dah-dah... #
- # If I only had a brain #

424
00:34:25,963 --> 00:34:28,363
Tom, you've heard of
Django Reinhardt, right?

425
00:34:30,468 --> 00:34:33,460
- No, Scott.
- Oh, my God. He is so amazing.

426
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:35,471
- He only had three fingers.
- Really?

427
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:37,473
- Yeah.
- Mmm. That's too bad.

428
00:34:39,043 --> 00:34:40,943
So, anyway...

429
00:34:41,045 --> 00:34:43,946
Julie, did you know Tom's
got a second interview tomorrow?

430
00:34:44,048 --> 00:34:45,948
Oh! That's great.

431
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:48,075
- Yeah, well...
- "I Surrender, Dear."

432
00:34:48,186 --> 00:34:51,986
- You what, honey?
- # Dah-dah, dah-dah #

433
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:53,717
# Dah-dah, dah-dah #

434
00:34:53,825 --> 00:34:56,419
# I surrender, dear ##

435
00:34:56,527 --> 00:34:58,495
I love that song.

436
00:34:58,596 --> 00:35:02,794
Oh, you know what? I think that's
on Decca. I've seen it in the bins.

437
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:05,460
- What, you have that record?
- Yeah.

438
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:07,435
I need that record desperately!

439
00:35:07,538 --> 00:35:11,201
- Yeah, so they seemed
to really like my portfolio.
- What?

440
00:35:11,309 --> 00:35:13,709
Oh, 'cause... Oh!
That's so exciting, Tom.

441
00:35:13,811 --> 00:35:17,144
- Yeah, you should really see
Tom's stuff. It's so great.
- Oh, go on.

442
00:35:17,248 --> 00:35:20,649
Well, it's a really good firm
and they seem to have room to grow.

443
00:35:20,751 --> 00:35:23,652
And you can maybe finally
move out of your mom's house.

444
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:30,288
Didn't you have... What was that,
that story about Brad and oranges?

445
00:35:30,394 --> 00:35:34,057
Didn't you have a story
about Brad and oranges?

446
00:35:34,165 --> 00:35:36,065
No, Scott.

447
00:35:37,835 --> 00:35:40,235
Whoa, Cynthia and I
have to, uh...

448
00:35:40,338 --> 00:35:43,239
we have to go get
some cocktails.

449
00:35:43,341 --> 00:35:45,468
Mmm.

450
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:50,042
I- I-I cannot believe you.

451
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:52,548
I'm sorry. That thing about
your mother just slipped out.

452
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:55,050
No, the whole evening.
What were those topics?

453
00:35:55,153 --> 00:36:00,250
- You were supposed to feed me openings
so I could jump in with the zingers.
- I was.

454
00:36:00,358 --> 00:36:02,758
- You weren't zinging.
- Oh, bullshit!

455
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:06,990
- How am I supposed to zing
on, what, "jingle-jangle"?
- Django Reinhardt!

456
00:36:07,098 --> 00:36:10,499
Look, I'm sorry. She told me
she was working in this record store.

457
00:36:10,601 --> 00:36:13,502
- You told me to keep things flowing.
- Oh, flowing. Yes, flo...

458
00:36:13,604 --> 00:36:16,004
You know,
you're making me sick, Scott.

459
00:36:16,107 --> 00:36:19,008
- You still have the drive home.
- The drive home?

460
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:21,670
The drive home is useless, you know.

461
00:36:21,779 --> 00:36:23,679
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

462
00:36:23,781 --> 00:36:25,681
- Hi.
- Hi.

463
00:36:39,463 --> 00:36:43,365
You know, we really didn't get
much of a chance to talk tonight.

464
00:36:48,973 --> 00:36:51,373
I wanted to tell you something.

465
00:36:54,478 --> 00:36:56,378
I remember you.

466
00:36:57,915 --> 00:37:01,112
We shared a music stand,
didn't we?

467
00:37:03,521 --> 00:37:05,682
Yeah.

468
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:09,692
I used to talk to you
about that guy I went out with... Kenny.

469
00:37:11,028 --> 00:37:12,928
That's right.

470
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:17,864
Anyway...

471
00:37:20,271 --> 00:37:22,171
What I remember is...

472
00:37:23,941 --> 00:37:26,341
you were a really nice guy.

473
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:37,319
Julie.

474
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:39,651
- Oww! Oh, shit.
- Ooh!

475
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:41,816
I am so... Ohh. Okay.

476
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:44,827
- Oh, my God.
- I should've warned you I was going in.

477
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:46,829
- Oh, God.
- Are... Are you...

478
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:49,832
No, you know, it's my fault.
I just... I do this, you know.

479
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:52,835
L... I give out
the wrong signals.

480
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:54,837
Oh.

481
00:38:00,077 --> 00:38:02,136
L...

482
00:38:03,914 --> 00:38:07,145
I'm re... I'm really sorry, Tom.

483
00:38:12,556 --> 00:38:15,457
I'm going away.

484
00:38:15,559 --> 00:38:18,255
You're going away?

485
00:38:18,362 --> 00:38:21,763
- It's sort of a... sort of a long story.
- But you just moved back.

486
00:38:21,866 --> 00:38:23,766
Well, I'm not really here.

487
00:38:23,868 --> 00:38:28,601
It's, like, a temporary arrangement
until I'm ready to go.

488
00:38:28,706 --> 00:38:33,837
I needed a place to stay and my dad,
you know, owns the building and I just...

489
00:38:37,948 --> 00:38:41,042
I mean, if I wasn't going away...

490
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:02,169
Well, I'm very sorry.

491
00:39:02,273 --> 00:39:04,673
I mean, your work is very strong.

492
00:39:04,775 --> 00:39:06,675
I fought for you.

493
00:39:06,777 --> 00:39:09,678
But the partners felt,
and I had to agree with them,

494
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:13,341
you just don't fulfill
our needs at this time.

495
00:39:13,451 --> 00:39:16,352
I want to thank you
for coming in.

496
00:39:20,758 --> 00:39:22,885
I didn't get the job.

497
00:39:37,508 --> 00:39:39,408
I'll get the boxes.

498
00:40:28,325 --> 00:40:30,225
He loved the Mets.

499
00:40:35,833 --> 00:40:38,324
Thank you for doing this.

500
00:40:47,011 --> 00:40:49,411
I got something you might want.

501
00:40:55,019 --> 00:40:57,783
Come here.

502
00:41:13,938 --> 00:41:16,805
There might be
one or two of you in there.

503
00:41:16,907 --> 00:41:18,807
You can take one.

504
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:37,293
It's hard to believe.

505
00:42:52,002 --> 00:42:54,402
- You're a beautiful boy.
- Oh, no, no.

506
00:42:54,505 --> 00:42:58,066
- Yes, you are.
- Well, thank you, Ruth. Thank you.

507
00:43:09,186 --> 00:43:11,086
Bill Senior, on the other hand,

508
00:43:11,188 --> 00:43:13,748
he had to get by on his wits.

509
00:43:13,857 --> 00:43:15,757
No chin.

510
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:24,060
I met him one night at this party
at Aunt Lucille's.

511
00:43:24,168 --> 00:43:28,195
I was 16.
I fell for him like that.

512
00:43:28,305 --> 00:43:30,933
Next day he left for Vietnam.

513
00:43:31,041 --> 00:43:32,941
Two years.

514
00:43:34,178 --> 00:43:37,978
So... what, you just
waited for him?

515
00:43:38,082 --> 00:43:40,482
Oh, sure.

516
00:43:40,584 --> 00:43:44,315
- I mean, there were
plenty of other suitors.
- I'm sure.

517
00:43:48,425 --> 00:43:52,885
But Bill Senior, you know,
he just... tickled my fancy.

518
00:43:52,997 --> 00:43:55,557
Whew, and those letters he wrote.

519
00:43:55,666 --> 00:43:57,861
Holy cow.

520
00:43:59,837 --> 00:44:02,533
I would've waited a few lifetimes.

521
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,540
You know what I mean?

522
00:44:08,946 --> 00:44:11,380
Yeah.

523
00:44:14,985 --> 00:44:16,885
It's that easy.

524
00:44:16,987 --> 00:44:20,388
I had the dial set a little thin.
- Press the button.

525
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:23,392
And now you'll feed
everything down to the last piece.

526
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:25,394
It's a perfect result!

527
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:27,293
- That's pretty good!
- Every time.

528
00:44:27,398 --> 00:44:30,299
- It's beautiful.
- It's perfection in slicing.

529
00:44:41,645 --> 00:44:44,546
- Please, Tom.
- Ruth, I'd really rather not.

530
00:44:44,648 --> 00:44:47,048
I need you to do this.

531
00:44:47,151 --> 00:44:50,552
He never talked to me
about things like this.

532
00:44:50,654 --> 00:44:53,054
It's... It's important to me.
Please.

533
00:44:54,992 --> 00:44:56,892
What do you want to know?

534
00:44:58,328 --> 00:45:00,228
Giris.

535
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:07,662
Well, I think
there was one girl Bill liked.

536
00:45:07,771 --> 00:45:09,671
Really?

537
00:45:13,877 --> 00:45:15,777
What was her name?

538
00:45:18,248 --> 00:45:21,149
- Julie.
- Julie.

539
00:45:24,288 --> 00:45:27,257
- Was she pretty?
- Oh, yeah.

540
00:45:28,992 --> 00:45:33,019
He did everything he could, but he just
couldn't stop thinking about her.

541
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:39,792
Even when he tried
really hard not to.

542
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:45,436
She haunted him.

543
00:45:45,542 --> 00:45:48,443
She haunted him.

544
00:45:48,545 --> 00:45:50,445
So what happened?

545
00:45:52,082 --> 00:45:54,983
Well, she told him
she was planning on going away,

546
00:45:55,085 --> 00:45:56,985
but I don't know.

547
00:46:03,827 --> 00:46:06,227
He couldn't let her go.

548
00:46:19,076 --> 00:46:22,477
I mean, he'd been in love
with her for so long.

549
00:46:35,959 --> 00:46:39,861
And I guess no one tickled
his fancy the way she did.

550
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:45,200
So, this Julie...

551
00:46:47,971 --> 00:46:51,099
Do you think
that's the reason he...

552
00:46:51,208 --> 00:46:55,406
No, Ruth. I knew we shouldn't
have gotten into this.

553
00:46:55,512 --> 00:46:58,948
- Could be the reason, you know.
- Ruth, no.

554
00:46:59,049 --> 00:47:00,949
- Did she go to Yale?
- What?

555
00:47:01,051 --> 00:47:03,952
There were all these
toll receipts in the car.
New Haven. Did she go to Yale?

556
00:47:04,054 --> 00:47:06,215
She didn't go to Y...
No, Ru... It...

557
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:11,351
I don't think it had anything
to do with her. I know it didn't.

558
00:49:24,728 --> 00:49:26,628
Hello?

559
00:49:26,730 --> 00:49:28,630
Tom? It's Julie.

560
00:49:28,732 --> 00:49:30,632
Hi, Julie...

561
00:49:30,734 --> 00:49:34,966
- Julie?
- Can I come over?
I have to talk to you.

562
00:49:35,072 --> 00:49:39,509
- Come over here?
- Yeah. I'm in the neighborhood.
I'm coming, okay?

563
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:46,681
- What are you doing?
- Someone's coming over. A girl.

564
00:49:46,783 --> 00:49:50,048
Don't make a big deal...
Is that what you're wearing?

565
00:49:50,153 --> 00:49:52,178
It's my friggin' house!

566
00:49:52,289 --> 00:49:55,190
Okay, try not to say "friggin',"
don't call me "Tom-Tom"...

567
00:49:55,292 --> 00:49:57,692
and no stories about me doing magic.

568
00:50:02,499 --> 00:50:04,399
- Hey.
- Hi.

569
00:50:04,501 --> 00:50:07,334
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

570
00:50:08,638 --> 00:50:12,039
- So, could I come in, or...
- Oh, sure.

571
00:50:22,819 --> 00:50:24,753
- Julie, this is my mom.
- Oh, hi.

572
00:50:24,855 --> 00:50:27,050
I'm Tom's mom.

573
00:50:27,157 --> 00:50:29,216
How are you?

574
00:50:33,830 --> 00:50:38,062
Tom-Tom comes out
in his funny little hat and cape...

575
00:50:38,135 --> 00:50:40,729
and he has a little magic wand.

576
00:50:40,837 --> 00:50:44,898
I'm telling you,
he was the cutest thing you ever saw!

577
00:50:45,008 --> 00:50:47,067
- I got a picture.
- Mom, no pictures.

578
00:50:47,177 --> 00:50:50,078
- Oh, wait, no! I got one in...
- Mom!

579
00:50:52,516 --> 00:50:54,575
I'm goin' in the kitchen now.

580
00:50:54,684 --> 00:50:56,584
Oy.

581
00:50:56,686 --> 00:50:58,586
It was really nice meeting you.

582
00:50:58,688 --> 00:51:00,588
Oh, it was nice meeting you too.

583
00:51:06,129 --> 00:51:08,529
- I'm sorry.
- No, I'm sorry.

584
00:51:08,632 --> 00:51:12,534
It's just, this thing happened
and I didn't know who else to turn to.

585
00:51:12,636 --> 00:51:15,628
Well, what's...
what's up?

586
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:18,901
Scott came to see me
last night.

587
00:51:19,009 --> 00:51:20,909
He did?
What, at work?

588
00:51:21,011 --> 00:51:22,740
- Yeah.
- How is Scott?

589
00:51:25,982 --> 00:51:28,143
He made a pass at me.

590
00:51:28,251 --> 00:51:31,152
Oh, my... Wh...
I can't believe he did this!

591
00:51:31,254 --> 00:51:33,154
What in... What...
I can't believe it!

592
00:51:33,256 --> 00:51:36,623
How could he kiss you like that
when he's supposed to be married?

593
00:51:36,726 --> 00:51:39,627
- How do you know he kissed me?
- How do l... How's that?

594
00:51:39,729 --> 00:51:42,630
I said "pass,"
I didn't say "kiss."

595
00:51:42,732 --> 00:51:45,633
- Oh, my God! Did he tell you this?
- No. I'm sorry.

596
00:51:45,735 --> 00:51:48,636
- I hear "pass," I move right to "kiss."
- Well, he did kiss me.

597
00:51:48,738 --> 00:51:50,831
Bastard!
What is he thinking?

598
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:54,900
I don't know what to do.
Do I tell Cynthia? Do I not tell her?

599
00:51:55,011 --> 00:51:57,912
Oh, you... you... you tell her.
This is a moral issue.

600
00:51:58,014 --> 00:52:02,178
Unfortunately, Scott is an adulterer and
that is something Cynthia should know.

601
00:52:02,285 --> 00:52:05,254
Okay, okay, but what if
it's not all Scott's fault, all right?

602
00:52:05,355 --> 00:52:08,256
- What if it's partly my fault?
- What do you mean?

603
00:52:08,358 --> 00:52:11,759
I'm just saying, he shows up
out of nowhere looking for a record?

604
00:52:11,862 --> 00:52:15,593
I should've seen it coming. I just...
I let things get out of control.

605
00:52:15,699 --> 00:52:18,293
- The same thing happened with Jed.
- Jed?

606
00:52:18,401 --> 00:52:21,302
One minute we're having
this casual conversation...
"Maybe we should live together."

607
00:52:21,404 --> 00:52:23,372
The next thing I know,
I'm getting married.

608
00:52:23,473 --> 00:52:25,873
- This is the guy you were gonna marry.
- Yeah.

609
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:29,434
I mean, I cared about him, you know,
and he really wanted to get married.

610
00:52:29,546 --> 00:52:33,141
But I guess I wasn't sure,
and I should've told him
that at the very beginning.

611
00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:36,344
I mean, before that whole
marriage thing got started.

612
00:52:40,624 --> 00:52:44,025
Have you ever not told someone something
that you should've told them,

613
00:52:44,127 --> 00:52:46,527
but you were afraid to,
so you didn't,

614
00:52:46,630 --> 00:52:49,531
and then it turned into
a whole complicated thing...

615
00:52:49,633 --> 00:52:52,659
that you never should've
gotten into in the first place?

616
00:52:55,005 --> 00:52:57,030
You kids want some Bosco?

617
00:52:57,140 --> 00:52:58,903
Mom! No!

618
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:02,274
Oh. I love Bosco.

619
00:53:04,447 --> 00:53:07,348
This is why you
never got first chair.

620
00:53:07,450 --> 00:53:09,350
- What?
- In band.

621
00:53:09,452 --> 00:53:13,354
Mr. Busto wanted you to challenge
Cliff Young for first chair,

622
00:53:13,456 --> 00:53:15,356
but you wouldn't do it.

623
00:53:15,458 --> 00:53:17,358
Oh, my God.

624
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:20,861
- I forgot about Cliff Young.
- You didn't want to hurt his feelings.

625
00:53:20,964 --> 00:53:24,400
- Well, he loved his solos.
- Yeah, but you were better than he was.

626
00:53:24,501 --> 00:53:26,401
- No.
- You were.

627
00:53:26,503 --> 00:53:28,903
I'll, I'll give
Cliff Young his trills,

628
00:53:29,005 --> 00:53:31,906
but you had it all over him
in the upper register.

629
00:53:32,008 --> 00:53:34,408
How do you remember
all this?

630
00:53:34,511 --> 00:53:37,105
I have a really good memory.

631
00:53:37,214 --> 00:53:39,614
Well,

632
00:53:39,716 --> 00:53:41,775
I guess I was always screwed up.

633
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:48,056
No, you were just worried
about other people's feelings.

634
00:53:48,158 --> 00:53:52,060
Yeah, but the thing is,
you spend your life worrying
about how other people feel,

635
00:53:52,162 --> 00:53:55,723
you sort of lose track,
you know, of how you feel.

636
00:53:57,334 --> 00:54:01,361
Does this have anything
to do with you going away?

637
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:03,302
Sort of.

638
00:54:04,407 --> 00:54:06,807
My plan...

639
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:10,346
is to save up, buy a car,

640
00:54:10,447 --> 00:54:13,348
pack all the things
I really care about...

641
00:54:13,450 --> 00:54:16,851
and just drive off on my own
for, like, a year.

642
00:54:16,953 --> 00:54:20,081
Because I never really
been on my own. You know?

643
00:54:31,301 --> 00:54:33,633
Y- You've got a thing.

644
00:54:33,737 --> 00:54:35,637
On my mouth?

645
00:54:55,659 --> 00:54:57,559
Listen, um,

646
00:54:59,162 --> 00:55:02,495
there's this thing tonight
at St. John the Divine.

647
00:55:02,599 --> 00:55:06,501
I got the tickets for me
and, you know, Jed.

648
00:55:08,371 --> 00:55:11,272
- It's this guy Gorczcki.
- Hockey?

649
00:55:11,374 --> 00:55:13,274
A composer.

650
00:55:13,376 --> 00:55:15,276
I know.

651
00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:22,150
So, uh,

652
00:55:24,254 --> 00:55:27,655
do you, you know...
do you want to go with me?

653
00:55:27,757 --> 00:55:29,657
Yes.

654
00:55:45,108 --> 00:55:48,009
- How could you do this to me?
- What?

655
00:55:48,111 --> 00:55:50,511
It's 2:30.
Where the hell have you been?

656
00:55:50,613 --> 00:55:54,515
- I really need to talk to you.
Can we please just go inside?
- They're waiting for us.

657
00:55:54,617 --> 00:55:57,518
- Who?
- Weren't you even listening
to me the other night?

658
00:55:57,620 --> 00:56:00,521
Of course I was listening to you.
What did you say?

659
00:56:00,623 --> 00:56:03,990
Aunt Lucille's.
The pool party.

660
00:56:04,094 --> 00:56:07,154
Did you even remember
to bring your trunks?

661
00:56:07,263 --> 00:56:10,664
Oh, Jesus. Let's go.
I packed some of Bill's.

662
00:56:13,536 --> 00:56:15,436
Come on!

663
00:56:15,538 --> 00:56:18,200
# Papa loves mambo #

664
00:56:19,542 --> 00:56:22,602
# Mama loves mambo #

665
00:56:22,712 --> 00:56:25,408
# Look at him sway with it
Gettin' so gay with it #

666
00:56:25,515 --> 00:56:27,745
- # Shoutin' "ole" with it now #
- Hey!

667
00:56:27,851 --> 00:56:30,012
# Papa loves mambo #

668
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:32,020
Ohh!

669
00:56:32,122 --> 00:56:34,852
Do you remember me?

670
00:56:34,958 --> 00:56:38,086
- Uh...
- Of course you don't.
You were this high.

671
00:56:38,194 --> 00:56:41,527
Boys, you remember Tom
from the funeral?

672
00:56:42,699 --> 00:56:45,759
Ruth told me everything
you've been doing.

673
00:56:45,869 --> 00:56:47,769
She did?

674
00:56:47,871 --> 00:56:50,772
I can't tell you
how wonderful you are,

675
00:56:50,874 --> 00:56:53,570
helping my sister-in-law
through this time.

676
00:56:53,676 --> 00:56:56,440
Oh, there she is.

677
00:56:56,546 --> 00:56:59,743
Ohh! Oh, you look great!

678
00:57:00,917 --> 00:57:02,817
You're making me cry.

679
00:57:02,919 --> 00:57:05,319
- Oh, well...
- You are so strong.

680
00:57:05,422 --> 00:57:09,324
I owe it all to Tom.
I mean, he was there for me, you know.

681
00:57:09,426 --> 00:57:13,385
- When I needed someone, he was there.
- Tom.

682
00:57:13,496 --> 00:57:15,396
# Feelin' that zing again, wow #

683
00:57:15,498 --> 00:57:17,830
- # Papa loves mambo #
- # Papa loves mambo #

684
00:57:17,934 --> 00:57:19,959
# Mama loves mambo ##

685
00:57:20,069 --> 00:57:24,438
Julie, hi.
It's, it's me, Tom.

686
00:57:24,541 --> 00:57:26,441
No, everything's fine.

687
00:57:26,543 --> 00:57:30,240
Listen, what time did you
say the concert was?

688
00:57:30,346 --> 00:57:32,473
No, I can make it, um...

689
00:57:32,582 --> 00:57:36,643
It's just, I had this horrible
family thing I couldn't get out of.

690
00:57:38,154 --> 00:57:40,918
Okay, great.

691
00:57:46,262 --> 00:57:49,754
No, I'm still here.

692
00:57:49,866 --> 00:57:52,198
Okay.

693
00:57:52,302 --> 00:57:53,735
Bye.

694
00:58:06,516 --> 00:58:09,383
# Come a little bit closer #

695
00:58:10,854 --> 00:58:13,823
- # Hear what I have to say #
- So, did you like it?

696
00:58:13,923 --> 00:58:15,823
It was great.

697
00:58:15,925 --> 00:58:20,760
- It was nothing like anything
we ever played in band though.

698
00:58:22,932 --> 00:58:25,264
Weren't all these recalled?

699
00:58:25,368 --> 00:58:28,963
No. That was the, uh, Pinto.

700
00:58:29,072 --> 00:58:31,973
- I don't think we're gonna make it.
- Are you kidding me?

701
00:58:32,075 --> 00:58:34,839
This... This thing's
running like a top.

702
00:58:38,581 --> 00:58:43,416
- # Oooh #
- # But there's a full moon risin' #

703
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:46,819
I'm sure
it just needs a minor adjustment.

704
00:58:49,092 --> 00:58:50,787
Tom?

705
00:58:50,894 --> 00:58:52,521
- Hmm?
- Who's Ruth?

706
00:58:54,664 --> 00:58:56,996
Ruth?

707
00:58:57,100 --> 00:59:01,264
You know, Ruth.
Under the seat, I found "Ruth."

708
00:59:02,405 --> 00:59:05,340
Oh, that's Ruth Abernathy's.
Bill's mom.

709
00:59:05,441 --> 00:59:08,342
I've been sort of
spending some time with her.

710
00:59:08,444 --> 00:59:12,039
You know, she's been going
through a, a difficult period.

711
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:15,450
Are you kidding me?

712
00:59:16,553 --> 00:59:18,350
What do you mean?

713
00:59:19,956 --> 00:59:22,049
That is so nice of you.

714
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:26,120
Oh. No, i-it really isn't.

715
00:59:26,229 --> 00:59:29,130
Yes, it is.
You don't even remember that guy.

716
00:59:29,232 --> 00:59:31,632
That is so nice of you.

717
00:59:31,734 --> 00:59:34,635
No, it... it really isn't.

718
00:59:41,578 --> 00:59:46,606
# Because I'm still
in love with you #

719
00:59:46,716 --> 00:59:50,618
# I wanna see you
dance again #

720
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:55,521
# Because I'm still
in love with you #

721
00:59:55,625 --> 01:00:01,427
# On this harvest moon ##

722
01:00:12,642 --> 01:00:15,076
- That's your room?
- What?

723
01:00:16,846 --> 01:00:18,746
Yeah. I tried to
get that off.

724
01:00:18,848 --> 01:00:20,748
It's, like, welded
to the door.

725
01:00:21,951 --> 01:00:24,351
Can I see?

726
01:00:24,454 --> 01:00:28,356
Um, my mom doesn't really
like me to drive her car.

727
01:00:28,458 --> 01:00:30,688
We really shouldn't dally.

728
01:00:30,793 --> 01:00:34,524
W- We're getting into
a dangerous zone here.

729
01:00:34,631 --> 01:00:36,792
You wait here, okay?

730
01:01:01,824 --> 01:01:03,724
Oh, shit.

731
01:01:06,229 --> 01:01:09,665
- Oh, Julie. Julie...
- Oh, my God.

732
01:01:09,766 --> 01:01:12,894
- I know. I should probably
get rid of the bunk bed, huh?

733
01:01:13,002 --> 01:01:14,902
- Oh! I'm sorry.
- Shh!

734
01:01:16,806 --> 01:01:18,706
Ohh.

735
01:01:18,808 --> 01:01:21,641
- Do you still play?
- Not really? Do you?

736
01:01:21,744 --> 01:01:23,871
No. I lost mine.

737
01:01:23,980 --> 01:01:26,073
Oh.

738
01:01:26,182 --> 01:01:29,083
- I remember these.
- Yeah.

739
01:01:31,454 --> 01:01:34,355
Shh!

740
01:01:34,457 --> 01:01:36,357
Oh! Sorry.

741
01:01:36,459 --> 01:01:38,359
These were great.

742
01:01:38,461 --> 01:01:40,691
What happened to these?

743
01:01:40,797 --> 01:01:43,698
They, they killed
a lot of people.

744
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:57,874
Um, I was cleaning out my closet...
that's why that's out.

745
01:02:06,422 --> 01:02:08,652
- Oh, my God.
- What?

746
01:02:08,758 --> 01:02:11,522
My hair.
I look so bizarre.

747
01:02:11,627 --> 01:02:13,527
No. No, you didn't.

748
01:02:13,629 --> 01:02:16,530
Look at that dress.
What was I thinking?

749
01:02:18,501 --> 01:02:20,401
You look beautiful.

750
01:02:21,971 --> 01:02:25,407
For the last seven years
I've been wishing I'd danced with you.

751
01:02:25,508 --> 01:02:27,408
What?

752
01:02:27,510 --> 01:02:30,741
Oh, uh, it was the...
homecoming dance.

753
01:02:33,015 --> 01:02:37,315
- You and me, we went to a dance?
- Oh, not together.

754
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:40,821
But it was during one of those weeks
that you and Kenny were broken up.

755
01:02:40,923 --> 01:02:42,823
We were talking
on the bleachers...

756
01:02:42,925 --> 01:02:44,825
and "Rock Lobster"
started playing...

757
01:02:44,927 --> 01:02:47,327
and you said
"I love this song,"

758
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:50,627
which I kinda took as a signal...

759
01:02:51,734 --> 01:02:53,634
that you wanted to dance.

760
01:02:53,736 --> 01:02:56,136
But...

761
01:02:56,239 --> 01:02:58,139
I didn't ask you.

762
01:02:59,408 --> 01:03:02,309
- Why not?
- 'Cause I can't dance.

763
01:03:08,117 --> 01:03:10,017
- Tom.
- What?

764
01:03:11,387 --> 01:03:13,480
- I'm goin' in.
- You're...

765
01:03:30,673 --> 01:03:32,573
Hi.

766
01:03:38,648 --> 01:03:40,548
- Oww.
- Oh. Oh.

767
01:03:40,650 --> 01:03:42,550
Oh!

768
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:46,620
Hello?

769
01:03:46,722 --> 01:03:49,623
So, how was the concert?

770
01:03:49,725 --> 01:03:53,627
- Hey. Hey, Ruth.
- Is there something you
want to tell me, Tom?

771
01:03:53,729 --> 01:03:56,630
- Hello?
- Mom, I'm on the phone here.

772
01:03:56,732 --> 01:03:58,632
- Who's calling so late?
- Mom, please.

773
01:03:58,734 --> 01:04:00,634
Well, is somebody
in there with you?

774
01:04:00,736 --> 01:04:03,671
I heard somebody come in with you.
Is there a girl in there?

775
01:04:03,773 --> 01:04:06,674
- Mom, I am on the phone!
- Jesus.

776
01:04:08,778 --> 01:04:10,678
Are you still there?

777
01:04:10,780 --> 01:04:13,180
I'm here.

778
01:04:18,454 --> 01:04:20,479
I- I found your bracelet.

779
01:04:23,059 --> 01:04:25,960
Is she there?

780
01:04:26,062 --> 01:04:28,963
She's there, isn't she?

781
01:04:29,065 --> 01:04:31,465
Are you gonna screw me, Tom?

782
01:04:32,768 --> 01:04:35,168
Are you gonna screw me over?

783
01:04:37,506 --> 01:04:39,406
You are, aren't you?

784
01:04:40,676 --> 01:04:42,576
You're gonna screw me over.

785
01:04:46,048 --> 01:04:47,413
You did what?

786
01:04:47,783 --> 01:04:49,546
Don't make a big deal out of this.

787
01:04:49,652 --> 01:04:53,520
You had sex with the dead guy's mother?
That lady from the funeral?

788
01:04:53,623 --> 01:04:57,024
- The lady from the funeral.
All right, Brad?
- Did you tell Scott?

789
01:04:57,126 --> 01:04:59,526
- I'm not talking to Scott.
- What do you mean?

790
01:04:59,629 --> 01:05:01,859
- Scott's an asshole.
- What are you talkin' about?

791
01:05:01,964 --> 01:05:05,627
- Brad!
- What's going on here?
Who are you these days?

792
01:05:05,735 --> 01:05:09,262
- The point is, what am I gonna
do about Ruth Abernathy?
- What are you gonna do?

793
01:05:09,372 --> 01:05:12,273
- You're gonna get out of there.
What are you, nuts?
- This is no good.

794
01:05:12,375 --> 01:05:15,708
- Brad!
- Okay. Okay. We have to wrap this up.

795
01:05:15,811 --> 01:05:18,439
Wrap it up?
We're nowhere, okay?

796
01:05:18,547 --> 01:05:21,380
I'm in a dilemma, Brad. Look.

797
01:05:21,484 --> 01:05:25,921
- What's that?
- That's her charm bracelet.

798
01:05:26,022 --> 01:05:28,286
- The dead guy's mother?
- Ruth Abernathy.

799
01:05:28,391 --> 01:05:30,723
- Her name is Ruth.
- Okay. Okay.

800
01:05:30,826 --> 01:05:34,592
Take that friggin' bracelet and
drop it in the mail. You understand?

801
01:05:34,697 --> 01:05:37,996
Write her a little love poem
and get rid of it, 'cause you're lost.

802
01:05:38,100 --> 01:05:41,934
What are you saying? Just drop it
in the mail? That's your big solution?

803
01:05:42,038 --> 01:05:44,939
- Get in here, Brad!
- Okay!

804
01:05:45,041 --> 01:05:48,374
- I gotta go. That's three calls.
I gotta go.
- Brad...

805
01:05:48,477 --> 01:05:51,378
Listen, that's all I got,
all right?

806
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:53,778
Mail it. Clean break.

807
01:05:53,883 --> 01:05:55,714
Tom.

808
01:05:57,553 --> 01:06:02,081
Look, it's good about you and Julie.
Don't worry about it.

809
01:06:04,093 --> 01:06:05,993
Thanks, Brad.

810
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:46,661
It's my birthday.

811
01:06:46,769 --> 01:06:51,103
I'm having brunch with
my parents on Sunday to celebrate.

812
01:06:51,207 --> 01:06:53,107
That'll be nice.

813
01:06:53,209 --> 01:06:55,040
Mmm.

814
01:06:56,512 --> 01:06:59,845
It'll be the first time
I've seen them since I left Jed.

815
01:07:00,950 --> 01:07:02,850
Mmm.

816
01:07:05,454 --> 01:07:07,354
Would you go with me?

817
01:07:10,459 --> 01:07:12,689
To meet your parents?

818
01:07:12,795 --> 01:07:15,195
Yeah.

819
01:07:15,297 --> 01:07:18,198
You want me
to meet your parents?

820
01:07:19,568 --> 01:07:21,468
Yeah.

821
01:07:24,874 --> 01:07:27,274
Is $15 enough?

822
01:07:27,376 --> 01:07:31,472
Ma, the name of this place is
Chanterelle. That's $50 right there.

823
01:07:31,580 --> 01:07:33,480
I'll get you another $5.

824
01:08:01,077 --> 01:08:02,977
Tom?

825
01:08:03,079 --> 01:08:05,547
Is that for you, Tom?

826
01:08:19,762 --> 01:08:21,855
- Hello.
- Is Tom here?

827
01:08:21,964 --> 01:08:25,195
Can you tell me
what this is regarding?

828
01:09:03,439 --> 01:09:05,339
You know where he went?

829
01:09:06,942 --> 01:09:08,432
Say something.

830
01:09:08,511 --> 01:09:11,412
- Honey, could we just eat
first before we...
- Tom.

831
01:09:11,514 --> 01:09:13,414
- Hi.
- Hi.

832
01:09:13,516 --> 01:09:15,416
Hello.

833
01:09:15,518 --> 01:09:17,748
Hi.

834
01:09:17,853 --> 01:09:19,753
Tom, this is
my father Philip.

835
01:09:19,855 --> 01:09:22,688
- It's really great to meet you, sir.
- I don't understand.

836
01:09:22,791 --> 01:09:24,691
- And, uh,
- Excuse me, sir.

837
01:09:24,793 --> 01:09:26,693
This is my mom Suzanne.

838
01:09:26,795 --> 01:09:29,696
- Oh. Good morning.
- Hello. Are you eating here too?

839
01:09:29,798 --> 01:09:32,699
Yes, Tom... Tom, uh,
is going to be joining us.

840
01:09:32,801 --> 01:09:35,702
- I thought we were here to talk.
- Please, honey, don't get upset.

841
01:09:35,804 --> 01:09:37,704
- I am upset.
- Oh. Um...

842
01:09:37,806 --> 01:09:40,934
Uh, look, look.
This is my birthday, okay?

843
01:09:41,043 --> 01:09:42,943
Tom is my guest.

844
01:09:43,045 --> 01:09:45,309
All right? Okay?

845
01:09:50,686 --> 01:09:52,745
I'm sorry. This is rude.

846
01:09:52,855 --> 01:09:55,847
I just don't understand.
Could you tell me what he's doing here?

847
01:09:55,958 --> 01:09:58,654
My daughter walks out
just before her wedding.

848
01:09:58,761 --> 01:10:02,128
I've barely heard from her in two
months. I want to know what's going on.

849
01:10:02,231 --> 01:10:04,131
- Well, that's understandable.
- Why is he talking?

850
01:10:04,233 --> 01:10:07,532
- Are you sleeping with her?
Is that what this is?
- Dad!

851
01:10:07,636 --> 01:10:11,299
- Philip.
- All right, I'll get to the point.

852
01:10:11,407 --> 01:10:14,433
This trip...
we've all talked about it,

853
01:10:14,543 --> 01:10:18,707
your mother and I and Grandma, and
we all agree... we don't understand it.

854
01:10:18,814 --> 01:10:22,375
Sweetheart, listen,
a little vacation is a great idea.

855
01:10:22,484 --> 01:10:25,681
Why would you want to waste
a year of your life?

856
01:10:25,788 --> 01:10:28,689
Look, I don't want
a vacation, all right?

857
01:10:35,297 --> 01:10:37,197
I'm...

858
01:10:38,534 --> 01:10:40,434
I'm lost, okay?

859
01:10:40,536 --> 01:10:42,936
I'm completely... lost.

860
01:10:43,038 --> 01:10:46,940
I don't know what I'm doing with
my life, and I need to take this trip.

861
01:10:47,042 --> 01:10:48,942
It's important, okay?

862
01:10:52,314 --> 01:10:54,509
I mean, Tom understands, you know.

863
01:10:54,617 --> 01:10:58,849
I feel like he's the only person
who understands what I'm doing.

864
01:10:58,954 --> 01:11:02,390
That's sort of the reason
I wanted him here.

865
01:11:02,491 --> 01:11:07,224
Tom, maybe
you could explain it to us.

866
01:11:17,506 --> 01:11:20,703
Well, Mrs. DeMarco, Mr. DeMarco,

867
01:11:23,279 --> 01:11:26,407
um, I can understand...

868
01:11:26,515 --> 01:11:29,916
how you might not want Julie
to go away right now.

869
01:11:32,421 --> 01:11:37,415
Uh, the truth is, it probably
has nothing to do with this trip.

870
01:11:39,528 --> 01:11:42,861
It's probably because
you just don't want her to leave.

871
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:48,600
But... But I just think
that Julie feels...

872
01:11:53,175 --> 01:11:55,075
Don't go, Julie.

873
01:11:55,177 --> 01:11:58,408
- What?
- I don't want you to go.
I mean, a year?

874
01:11:58,514 --> 01:12:02,610
- I thought we were doing something here.
- Tom, what are you saying?

875
01:12:02,718 --> 01:12:05,619
- I told you this was
a temporary thing. I said that.
- I know.

876
01:12:05,721 --> 01:12:08,622
I've never felt like this
in my whole life, Julie.

877
01:12:08,724 --> 01:12:12,888
I feel like we... I mean,
I feel like... I really know you.

878
01:12:15,431 --> 01:12:17,831
Don't you?
I mean, is it just me?

879
01:12:22,771 --> 01:12:25,831
- Excuse me, ma'am.
- There you are!

880
01:12:25,941 --> 01:12:27,909
- Who is this?
- Oh, my God!

881
01:12:28,010 --> 01:12:30,638
- Mrs. Abernathy?
- I wanna talk to you.

882
01:12:30,746 --> 01:12:32,771
- Ruth, this is not a good time.
- We're having a brunch here.

883
01:12:32,881 --> 01:12:35,679
- We're going outside.
- This is the way you say good-bye?

884
01:12:35,784 --> 01:12:38,150
- It was just for the sex, wasn't it?
- Jesus, Ruth.

885
01:12:38,253 --> 01:12:41,188
- He's sleeping with everybody.
Have you been tested?
- What is she talking about?

886
01:12:41,290 --> 01:12:43,986
And what's this lousy poem? Is this
supposed to mean something to me?

887
01:12:44,093 --> 01:12:46,994
- You wrote her a poem?
- No. Let's go.

888
01:12:47,096 --> 01:12:50,327
- Sex, sex, sex.
You're a horrible young man.

889
01:12:50,432 --> 01:12:52,332
- Julie...
- Julie?

890
01:12:52,434 --> 01:12:54,334
- Oh, is this her?
- Yes.

891
01:12:54,436 --> 01:12:56,597
- This is Julie, and we're going.
- Tell her, Tom.

892
01:12:56,705 --> 01:13:00,607
- Tell her what you did to
your best friend's mother!
- Oh, my God. Tom!

893
01:13:07,983 --> 01:13:10,281
He wasn't my best friend.

894
01:13:16,492 --> 01:13:18,392
- Julie.
- What are you talking about?

895
01:13:18,494 --> 01:13:20,655
- Julie.
- Tom!

896
01:13:22,598 --> 01:13:25,965
Look, Ruth,
I don't even remember Bill.

897
01:13:29,571 --> 01:13:31,471
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

898
01:14:17,319 --> 01:14:19,753
# She's a super freak
Super freak #

899
01:14:19,855 --> 01:14:23,291
# She's super freaky
Yeow #

900
01:14:23,392 --> 01:14:25,019
# Everybody sing #

901
01:14:25,127 --> 01:14:27,152
# Super freak
Super freak #

902
01:14:28,263 --> 01:14:32,222
# She's a very special girl #

903
01:14:32,334 --> 01:14:34,734
- # From her head down to her tail #
- Hey! Hey!

904
01:14:34,837 --> 01:14:38,238
- How's about a little response?
Tommy, how ya doin'?

905
01:14:38,340 --> 01:14:41,332
- Brad...
- Hey, nurse! Over here!
We got another patient!

906
01:14:41,443 --> 01:14:43,536
- No, no! Don't, Brad! Don't!
- This is...

907
01:14:43,645 --> 01:14:47,137
This is my good friend Tommy. We need
to give him a little mouth-to-mouth.

908
01:14:47,249 --> 01:14:50,650
- Stop kidding, all right?
- Hey, what's the matter, man?
It's my last Tuesday!

909
01:14:50,752 --> 01:14:53,653
- I'm gettin' married!
I'm happy. I'm happy.
- I know! I am too!

910
01:14:53,755 --> 01:14:55,746
I'm just not in the mood, all right?

911
01:14:55,858 --> 01:14:59,624
I forgot.
You don't like bachelor parties.
You only get turned on at funerals.

912
01:14:59,728 --> 01:15:03,220
- All right, very funny.
- Nurse, please! You talk to him.

913
01:15:03,332 --> 01:15:06,824
- No. I'm outta here. I'm leaving.
- Where are you going?

914
01:15:06,935 --> 01:15:09,096
- Brad, get off!
- # That girl's a super freak #

915
01:15:09,204 --> 01:15:12,139
- # I really like to taste her #
- # Every time we meet #

916
01:15:12,241 --> 01:15:15,642
- Lauren is right about you.
- # She's all right, she's all right #

917
01:15:15,744 --> 01:15:18,076
- I defended you.
- # The girl's all right #

918
01:15:18,180 --> 01:15:21,308
- # With me #
- I said you'd come through
in the end, but she's right.

919
01:15:21,416 --> 01:15:25,785
She told me not
to have you from the start.
She said Scott should be my best man.

920
01:15:27,489 --> 01:15:29,980
- Scott? That's what she said? Scott?
- # She's a super freak #

921
01:15:30,092 --> 01:15:32,993
- Yeah. 'Cause he's a better best man.
- # She's super freaky #

922
01:15:33,095 --> 01:15:34,995
Don't marry her, Brad.

923
01:15:35,097 --> 01:15:37,031
- # Temptations, sing #
- Hey.

924
01:15:37,132 --> 01:15:40,124
Lauren's an albatross
around your neck, Brad. Don't marry her.

925
01:15:40,235 --> 01:15:43,136
- Tommy...
- And by the way, Scott thinks so too.

926
01:15:43,238 --> 01:15:46,935
# Whoa-ohh-ohh
Ohh-ohh-ohh-ohh #

927
01:15:47,042 --> 01:15:50,136
# She's a very kinky girl #

928
01:15:50,245 --> 01:15:53,146
# The kind you won't
take home to Mother #

929
01:15:53,248 --> 01:15:55,182
Bastard!

930
01:15:55,284 --> 01:15:57,445
Hey! Hey!

931
01:16:00,289 --> 01:16:03,690
Let him go.
Are you okay? Tom...

932
01:16:03,792 --> 01:16:06,955
- Get off me!
- Hey, asshole!

933
01:16:07,062 --> 01:16:10,998
- Get out of my party! Get out of here!
- I saw you with her, Scott.

934
01:16:11,099 --> 01:16:14,000
No one wants you here! Get out!

935
01:16:14,102 --> 01:16:16,866
Get off of me, Joey!

936
01:16:16,972 --> 01:16:19,907
I don't want him here!
You're not allowed!

937
01:16:20,008 --> 01:16:21,908
- What happened?
- Scott!

938
01:16:35,090 --> 01:16:37,490
- Tom?
- Yeah, Mom?

939
01:16:37,593 --> 01:16:39,493
Scott's here.

940
01:17:21,603 --> 01:17:24,504
So, what are you doing in here?

941
01:17:29,177 --> 01:17:32,078
New carburetor.
Just checking the idle.

942
01:17:37,653 --> 01:17:41,487
So, Brad's a little upset.

943
01:17:41,590 --> 01:17:43,490
Tried talking to him, but...

944
01:17:45,093 --> 01:17:47,994
Doesn't look like
you're gonna be the best man.

945
01:17:48,096 --> 01:17:50,997
Well, you'd make a better best man
anyway, wouldn't you, Scott?

946
01:17:55,937 --> 01:17:57,837
Cynthia kicked me out.

947
01:18:01,376 --> 01:18:03,776
We had this little fight and it...

948
01:18:06,014 --> 01:18:08,915
I don't even know what it was about.

949
01:18:12,854 --> 01:18:14,754
Look, Tom, I'm really sorry.

950
01:18:18,026 --> 01:18:20,426
I messed up.

951
01:18:30,372 --> 01:18:32,272
Tasha Cortina.

952
01:18:32,374 --> 01:18:34,274
- Oh. Tasha Cortina.
- Yeah.

953
01:18:34,376 --> 01:18:36,276
But she had that lip thing.

954
01:18:36,378 --> 01:18:38,778
- What lip thing?
- You know, that little scar.

955
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:41,781
- No, I liked that scar. It was sexy.
- For me, it ruined everything.

956
01:18:41,883 --> 01:18:43,783
- Oh, you're too critical.
- Yeah.

957
01:18:43,885 --> 01:18:46,285
- Boys?
- Ma! We're talk...

958
01:18:46,388 --> 01:18:49,289
I can't believe
you just walk in here.

959
01:18:49,391 --> 01:18:52,724
I'm 25 years old.
This is why I need the lock.

960
01:18:52,828 --> 01:18:56,229
- I just wanted to know
if you want some ice cream.
- A little.

961
01:19:04,139 --> 01:19:06,903
Seventh grade. Nancy Weinberg.

962
01:19:07,008 --> 01:19:08,908
Oh, she liked me.

963
01:19:09,010 --> 01:19:10,910
- She did not like you.
- She did.

964
01:19:11,012 --> 01:19:13,913
She had this very serious thing,
like an obsessión.

965
01:19:14,015 --> 01:19:16,176
No, don't you remember
Angela Mineri?

966
01:19:16,284 --> 01:19:19,742
Angela Mineri told you Nancy Weinberg
had this big crush on you.

967
01:19:19,855 --> 01:19:22,756
- You went up to Nancy
in front of everybody...
- Oh, no. Shit.

968
01:19:22,858 --> 01:19:25,452
- And she laughed in your face.
- Yeah, that's right.

969
01:19:25,560 --> 01:19:28,961
- It was the other Tom.
She had a crush on him.
- What other Tom?

970
01:19:29,064 --> 01:19:30,964
The other Tom.

971
01:19:32,267 --> 01:19:34,167
Wait, what are you saying?

972
01:19:35,470 --> 01:19:37,870
- Oh, Jesus.
- Mr. Jellison's class.

973
01:19:37,973 --> 01:19:40,874
- In eighth grade.
- He got a 58 in unit one algebra...

974
01:19:40,976 --> 01:19:42,876
and then he started crying.

975
01:19:42,978 --> 01:19:45,378
Whatever happened to that guy?

976
01:19:45,480 --> 01:19:48,074
- He went to a different
high school... Madison.
- How do you know?

977
01:19:48,183 --> 01:19:51,084
'Cause Nancy Weinberg kept on going out
with him all through high school.

978
01:19:51,186 --> 01:19:53,086
Whatever happened to that guy?

979
01:19:53,188 --> 01:19:57,090
I don't know. I heard that Nancy
Weinberg is in grad school at Yale.

980
01:19:57,192 --> 01:20:00,457
Yale. Yale.

981
01:20:00,562 --> 01:20:03,463
- Tom, what are you doing?
You're going now?
- I gotta go!

982
01:20:14,509 --> 01:20:18,639
I've been driving all night.
I have to tell you something.

983
01:20:19,948 --> 01:20:21,848
Can I come in?

984
01:20:40,068 --> 01:20:41,968
Ruth, please.

985
01:20:44,873 --> 01:20:47,569
You lied to me.

986
01:20:49,010 --> 01:20:50,910
You used my son...

987
01:20:53,148 --> 01:20:55,207
the memory of my son.

988
01:20:59,821 --> 01:21:01,721
That was all I had left.

989
01:21:05,994 --> 01:21:08,155
How could you do that?

990
01:21:27,282 --> 01:21:31,343
I remember when my third-grade teacher
cut her finger on a paper cutter...

991
01:21:31,453 --> 01:21:33,353
and had to go home.

992
01:21:35,490 --> 01:21:40,359
I remember when Bruce Feinbaum
tripped Matthew Ellison...

993
01:21:40,462 --> 01:21:42,362
during the fire drill...

994
01:21:42,464 --> 01:21:45,524
An-and everyone laughed.

995
01:21:45,634 --> 01:21:49,934
L... I have a really
good memory, Ruth,

996
01:21:50,038 --> 01:21:51,938
but...

997
01:21:53,041 --> 01:21:55,942
no matter how hard
I wracked my brain,

998
01:21:56,044 --> 01:21:57,944
I couldn't remember your son.

999
01:22:00,515 --> 01:22:02,676
The fact that I could...

1000
01:22:02,784 --> 01:22:04,684
forget him like that,

1001
01:22:04,786 --> 01:22:06,686
that his life could...

1002
01:22:08,156 --> 01:22:11,250
leave so little impressión on me,
that really scared me.

1003
01:22:11,359 --> 01:22:13,259
I mean, it...

1004
01:22:14,996 --> 01:22:16,896
It terrified me.

1005
01:22:21,770 --> 01:22:24,671
Because I wouldn't
want to be forgotten.

1006
01:22:31,446 --> 01:22:34,438
I- I'm sorry. Sh-Should
I just keep waiting in the car?

1007
01:22:36,551 --> 01:22:38,781
No, it's okay.

1008
01:22:45,961 --> 01:22:47,895
R- Ruth.

1009
01:22:52,567 --> 01:22:54,467
Um...

1010
01:22:56,805 --> 01:22:59,535
This is Tom Thompson.

1011
01:23:06,147 --> 01:23:08,047
Hi, Mrs. Abernathy.

1012
01:23:24,699 --> 01:23:28,362
He, uh, wanted you
to have his car.

1013
01:23:30,171 --> 01:23:32,696
Oh, no. No. No.

1014
01:23:32,807 --> 01:23:35,332
L... It'd be too sad.

1015
01:23:37,612 --> 01:23:39,512
Look, I have a car.

1016
01:23:42,384 --> 01:23:46,013
Well, l... I did put
some money into it.

1017
01:23:46,121 --> 01:23:48,351
You keep it.

1018
01:23:48,456 --> 01:23:50,356
Yeah?

1019
01:23:52,761 --> 01:23:54,661
So, uh,

1020
01:23:54,763 --> 01:23:56,663
you guys were close?

1021
01:23:56,765 --> 01:23:59,495
Not really.
We just knew each other.

1022
01:24:22,757 --> 01:24:25,385
It's so hard to let him go.

1023
01:24:27,228 --> 01:24:29,128
I don't know.

1024
01:24:31,199 --> 01:24:33,793
I mean,

1025
01:24:36,438 --> 01:24:38,167
I needed someone.

1026
01:24:43,111 --> 01:24:45,511
I needed someone too.

1027
01:25:00,662 --> 01:25:02,687
# Let the river #

1028
01:25:02,797 --> 01:25:06,062
# Rock you like a cradle #

1029
01:25:07,569 --> 01:25:10,367
# Climb to the treetops #

1030
01:25:10,472 --> 01:25:12,872
# Child, if you're able #

1031
01:25:14,542 --> 01:25:17,511
# Let your hands tie a knot #

1032
01:25:17,612 --> 01:25:20,547
- # Across the table #
- May He lift His countenance upon you...

1033
01:25:20,648 --> 01:25:23,310
- and grant you His most precious gift...
- # Come #

1034
01:25:23,418 --> 01:25:26,512
- # And touch the things
you cannot feel #
- and His blessings of peace.

1035
01:25:26,621 --> 01:25:28,589
- Amen.
- Amen.

1036
01:25:28,690 --> 01:25:32,592
# And close your fingertips #

1037
01:25:32,694 --> 01:25:35,219
# And fly where I can't hold you #

1038
01:25:35,330 --> 01:25:37,696
Mazel tov!

1039
01:25:37,799 --> 01:25:39,699
# Let the sun rain fall #

1040
01:25:39,801 --> 01:25:44,397
# And let the blue clouds
enfold you #

1041
01:25:44,506 --> 01:25:47,566
# And maybe you can sing to me #

1042
01:25:47,675 --> 01:25:51,372
# The words I just told you #

1043
01:25:51,479 --> 01:25:55,939
# With all the things
your feelings were facing #

1044
01:25:57,485 --> 01:26:00,977
# Then don't mind me #

1045
01:26:01,089 --> 01:26:04,581
# 'Cause I ain't nothin' #

1046
01:26:04,692 --> 01:26:07,593
# But a dream #

1047
01:26:12,667 --> 01:26:17,070
# The mockingbird
sings each different song #

1048
01:26:17,172 --> 01:26:22,075
# Each song has wings #

1049
01:26:22,177 --> 01:26:25,806
# They won't stay long #

1050
01:26:25,914 --> 01:26:28,678
# Do those who hear #

1051
01:26:28,783 --> 01:26:32,014
# Think he's doing wrong #

1052
01:26:33,121 --> 01:26:35,919
# While the church bell #

1053
01:26:36,024 --> 01:26:38,925
# Tolls its one-note song #

1054
01:26:40,161 --> 01:26:42,629
# And the school bell #

1055
01:26:42,730 --> 01:26:45,130
# Is tinkling to the throng #

1056
01:26:47,835 --> 01:26:49,860
# Come here #

1057
01:26:49,971 --> 01:26:53,566
# Where your ears cannot hear #

1058
01:26:55,043 --> 01:26:58,672
# And close your ears #

1059
01:26:58,780 --> 01:27:03,615
# Child, and listen
to what I'll tell you #

1060
01:27:03,718 --> 01:27:06,812
# Follow in the darkest night #

1061
01:27:06,921 --> 01:27:10,857
# The sounds that may impel you #

1062
01:27:10,959 --> 01:27:13,519
# And the song that I am singing #

1063
01:27:13,628 --> 01:27:18,258
# May disturb or serve to quell you #

1064
01:27:18,366 --> 01:27:23,133
# If all the sound
you're hearing is what they sing #

1065
01:27:24,339 --> 01:27:27,866
# Then don't mind me #

1066
01:27:27,976 --> 01:27:31,412
# 'Cause I ain't nothin' #

1067
01:27:31,512 --> 01:27:34,140
# But a dream #

1068
01:27:34,249 --> 01:27:37,776
# Mm-mmm-mmm-mmm, mmm ##

1069
01:28:05,513 --> 01:28:07,413
Julie.

1070
01:28:09,684 --> 01:28:13,677
Tom, leave me alone.

1071
01:28:13,788 --> 01:28:16,120
I just wanted
to give you this.

1072
01:28:18,493 --> 01:28:20,188
Julie, pl...

1073
01:28:21,296 --> 01:28:23,890
- Julie, wait!
- Tom, don't do this.

1074
01:28:23,998 --> 01:28:26,432
- Please, just take this.
- Tom.

1075
01:28:26,534 --> 01:28:29,935
I don't want this.
I'm going away.

1076
01:28:31,806 --> 01:28:33,706
It's a birthday present.

1077
01:28:33,808 --> 01:28:35,708
Belated. Please.

1078
01:28:39,314 --> 01:28:41,612
Please.

1079
01:28:44,218 --> 01:28:46,550
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

1080
01:28:46,654 --> 01:28:51,557
The band is gonna take a short break
now, but we'll be back a little later.

1081
01:29:01,836 --> 01:29:03,736
I don't understand.

1082
01:29:03,838 --> 01:29:07,239
It has a new carburetor,
if that's what you're worried about.

1083
01:29:11,212 --> 01:29:14,113
Tom.

1084
01:29:14,215 --> 01:29:16,740
Uh, I can't take your car.

1085
01:29:16,851 --> 01:29:19,752
The tires are good
for another 10,000 miles,

1086
01:29:19,854 --> 01:29:22,982
so, you know,
that should take you...

1087
01:29:23,091 --> 01:29:24,991
wherever you wanna go.

1088
01:29:31,466 --> 01:29:34,367
It's a really good car.
Please take it.

1089
01:29:34,469 --> 01:29:36,869
I'll be your deejay
this evening spinning tunes.

1090
01:29:36,971 --> 01:29:39,872
We're gonna slow things down
with this one.

1091
01:29:39,974 --> 01:29:42,602
# Come to me now #

1092
01:29:45,179 --> 01:29:48,637
- # Lay yourself over me #
- I love this song.

1093
01:29:50,318 --> 01:29:53,219
- # Even if it's wrong #
- Is that a signal?

1094
01:29:53,321 --> 01:29:55,812
# We'll be all right #

1095
01:29:55,923 --> 01:29:58,915
# And I shall believe #

1096
01:30:01,229 --> 01:30:03,720
# Broken in two #

1097
01:30:06,167 --> 01:30:10,069
# And I know you're onto me #

1098
01:30:11,506 --> 01:30:14,031
# That I only come home #

1099
01:30:14,142 --> 01:30:16,940
# When I'm so all alone #

1100
01:30:17,044 --> 01:30:20,377
# And I do believe #

1101
01:30:22,784 --> 01:30:28,518
# That not everything is gonna be
the way you think it oughta be #

1102
01:30:28,623 --> 01:30:33,492
# It seems that every time I try to make
it right it all comes down on me #

1103
01:30:33,594 --> 01:30:36,256
# Please say honestly #

1104
01:30:36,364 --> 01:30:40,892
# You won't give up on me #

1105
01:30:41,002 --> 01:30:44,563
# And I shall believe #

1106
01:30:46,307 --> 01:30:49,367
# And I shall believe #

1107
01:30:51,779 --> 01:30:54,077
# Open the door #

1108
01:30:56,884 --> 01:31:00,376
# And show me your face tonight #

1109
01:31:01,489 --> 01:31:04,253
# I know it's true #

1110
01:31:04,358 --> 01:31:07,384
# No one heals me like you #

1111
01:31:07,495 --> 01:31:11,124
# And you hold the key #

1112
01:31:13,434 --> 01:31:18,929
# Then not everything is gonna be
the way you think it oughta be #

1113
01:31:19,040 --> 01:31:23,977
# It seems like every time I try to make
it right it all comes down on me #

1114
01:31:24,078 --> 01:31:26,569
# Please say honestly #

1115
01:31:26,681 --> 01:31:30,139
# You won't give up on me #

1116
01:31:31,486 --> 01:31:34,978
# And I shall believe ##

1117
01:31:39,727 --> 01:31:42,628
- Hello?
- What's going on?

1118
01:31:42,730 --> 01:31:44,630
We have a problem here.

1119
01:31:47,368 --> 01:31:49,962
- Did you knock?
- I'm knocking. Hello!

1120
01:31:50,071 --> 01:31:51,971
Hello!

1121
01:31:53,207 --> 01:31:55,107
What's going on?

1122
01:31:55,209 --> 01:31:57,074
She won't come out.

1123
01:31:57,178 --> 01:31:59,646
Wh... Oh, Jesus.

1124
01:31:59,747 --> 01:32:02,147
Ma.

1125
01:32:02,250 --> 01:32:06,277
Ma, come on. I'm only
gonna be ten minutes away, Ma.

1126
01:32:06,387 --> 01:32:09,288
- No.
- We'll see each other all the time.

1127
01:32:09,390 --> 01:32:11,517
- I don't want you to go.
- Ma...

1128
01:32:11,626 --> 01:32:13,617
- Ma!
- Not now!

1129
01:32:16,964 --> 01:32:19,865
I just got over
that back injury from roller-blading.

1130
01:32:19,967 --> 01:32:22,800
I'm just saying,
this is getting heavier and heavier.

1131
01:32:22,904 --> 01:32:26,305
What happens when Julie comes back?
You'll have to move again?

1132
01:32:26,407 --> 01:32:29,308
- No, she gave it to me.
They're letting me rent it.

1133
01:32:29,410 --> 01:32:31,435
You wanna be careful
with my bunk bed?

1134
01:32:31,546 --> 01:32:33,446
You wanna complain, you pay.

1135
01:32:35,783 --> 01:32:38,684
So, is that, uh,
the last of it?

1136
01:32:38,786 --> 01:32:41,687
That's everything. Don't worry.
This is gonna be good, Tom.

1137
01:32:41,789 --> 01:32:45,384
- What if this job doesn't work out?
- Didn't you get the job already?

1138
01:32:45,493 --> 01:32:48,394
- Yeah, but what if it doesn't work out.
- It's gonna work out.

1139
01:32:48,496 --> 01:32:50,396
Come on, let's go.

1140
01:32:51,933 --> 01:32:56,131
- # Come a little bit closer #
- Tom, let's go.

1141
01:32:56,237 --> 01:33:00,139
- # Hear what I have to say #
- Come on, Tom.
It's getting late.

1142
01:33:01,609 --> 01:33:04,510
- Hey, Tom, come on!
- Tom, you ready?

1143
01:33:04,612 --> 01:33:06,671
All right, all right.

1144
01:33:06,781 --> 01:33:08,681
I'm ready.

1145
01:33:08,783 --> 01:33:13,311
- # Just like children sleepin' #
- Let's move.

1146
01:33:13,554 --> 01:33:17,581
# You'll dream this night away #

1147
01:33:25,766 --> 01:33:29,634
# But there's a full moon risin' #

1148
01:33:29,737 --> 01:33:35,698
# Let's go dancin' in the light #

1149
01:33:42,483 --> 01:33:46,544
# We know where the music's playin' #

1150
01:33:46,654 --> 01:33:52,786
# Let's go out and feel the night #

1151
01:33:59,233 --> 01:34:03,932
# Because I'm still in love with you #

1152
01:34:04,038 --> 01:34:07,940
# I wanna see you dance again #

1153
01:34:08,042 --> 01:34:12,843
# Because I'm still in love with you #

1154
01:34:12,947 --> 01:34:18,749
# On this harvest moon ##

1155
01:34:41,676 --> 01:34:43,576
This is what I believe.

1156
01:34:54,155 --> 01:34:57,215
# Been so long since I met you #

1157
01:34:59,060 --> 01:35:02,757
# And all the changes we been through #

1158
01:35:04,265 --> 01:35:07,496
# And all this time I can't forget you #

1159
01:35:09,070 --> 01:35:14,098
# Everywhere I turn I think of you #

1160
01:35:14,208 --> 01:35:17,041
# I #

1161
01:35:17,144 --> 01:35:18,907
# Wanna trust ya, lady #

1162
01:35:19,013 --> 01:35:21,846
# And you #

1163
01:35:21,949 --> 01:35:24,349
# You're all I need #

1164
01:35:24,452 --> 01:35:26,886
# Soul to soul, fire to fire #

1165
01:35:26,987 --> 01:35:29,478
# Nothin' to light this man's desire #

1166
01:35:29,590 --> 01:35:33,185
# Love is a beautiful thing #

1167
01:35:34,628 --> 01:35:37,153
# One to one, you and me #

1168
01:35:37,264 --> 01:35:39,357
# Oh, I know it's our destiny #

1169
01:35:39,467 --> 01:35:44,495
- # 'Cause love is a beautiful thing #
- # Beautiful, so beautiful #

1170
01:35:44,605 --> 01:35:47,301
# To stay together
through thick and thin #

1171
01:35:47,408 --> 01:35:49,638
# Now I know I got a friend #

1172
01:35:49,744 --> 01:35:54,977
# 'Cause love is a beautiful thing #

1173
01:35:55,082 --> 01:35:57,744
# We've faced the fears
all through the years #

1174
01:35:57,852 --> 01:36:03,154
- # Now I know there are no more tears #
- # Love is a beautiful thing #

1175
01:36:03,257 --> 01:36:05,225
# Ahh, ohh-ooh #

1176

# Soul to soul, fire to fire #

1177

# Nothin' to light
this man's desire #

1178
01:36:10,064 --> 01:36:13,659
# Because love is a beautiful thing #

1179
01:36:13,768 --> 01:36:17,033
- # Ohh ohh-ohh #
- # Ohh-whoa-whoa #

1180
01:36:17,138 --> 01:36:20,630

Oh, I know it's our destiny #
