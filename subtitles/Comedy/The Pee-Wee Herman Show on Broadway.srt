1
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:04,707
Help!

2
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,688
Help!

3
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,168
Help!

4
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,628
Help!

5
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,388
Help!

6
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,206
<i>Pee Mak</i>

7
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,561
<i>"Pee Mak Phra Khanong"</i>

8
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,925
It's been a long time and

9
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,569
still no one has come to our rescue.

10
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,041
The Enemy has surrounded
us and broken through our lines.

11
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,927
Our forces

12
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,481
have taken heavy casualties
and thus are dying in droves.

13
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,850
If this keeps up,

14
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,428
I think

15
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,046
we'll definitely be defeated.

16
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,881
Why the hell are you
talking like that?

17
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,890
So old fashioned!

18
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,600
You're in the past, dude!

19
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,960
Private Mark is injured.

20
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,280
Hey Mark!

21
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,120
How bad is it, doc?

22
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,240
You'll be okay.

23
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,640
You've only sprained your leg.

24
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,800
Sprained my leg?

25
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,360
Sprained,

26
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,400
and he screams.

27
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,390
I thought it was worse.

28
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,640
Will I make it back
home to Phra Khanong?

29
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,680
Nak, my wife probably
gave birth already.

30
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,680
Is it the end of the line for us?

31
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,810
Damn it!

32
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,090
Don't give up!

33
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,360
Didn't you hear of The
Battle of Bang Rajan?

34
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,920
King Leonidas.

35
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,600
Stellos.

36
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,280
They fought thousands of enemies.

37
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,280
Uh...

38
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:20,320
But in the end everybody died, right?

39
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:21,840
Oh.

40
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,360
Sorry.

41
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,320
I haven't finished.

42
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,680
Then think of "Rocky".

43
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,640
Rocky Road?

44
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,240
It's yummy! Where is it?

45
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,400
Where is it?

46
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,080
Not now!

47
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,000
How about the "Last Samurai"?

48
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,760
During his final battle
He fought so hard his blade shattered.

49
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,840
He didn't even think of giving up.

50
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,360
We've still got our swords.

51
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,280
We've still got our
bodies in one piece.

52
00:03:58,281 --> 00:03:59,140
Asshole!

53
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,100
My apologies.

54
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,740
Just swords then...

55
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,218
So why can't we fight?

56
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:08,519
Yeah...

57
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,800
Kill them!

58
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,400
Kill them!

59
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,000
Shit.

60
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,770
I forgot they had guns.

61
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:49,960
Oh...

62
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,810
Are you okay, Mark?

63
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,800
Hey Shin,

64
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,960
since we're all going to die anyway.

65
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,890
Can I ask you something?

66
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,880
What's with the hair?

67
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:15,640
When I was little
there was a bubonic plague outbreak.

68
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,310
I almost died.

69
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,800
So my mother swore
to god if I survived

70
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,320
I would keep this hairdo
for the rest of my life.

71
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,360
I'd rather die than live with
this ugly topknot hairdo.

72
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,360
It looks like a dog's ankle.

73
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,760
What about yours?

74
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,410
I'm a trend setter.

75
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,010
Stop shooting at us! Assholes!

76
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,880
Mark, do you have any last words?

77
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,130
No I don't.

78
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,240
No matter what I'll make it
back to see my wife and baby.

79
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,160
I'm not allowing myself
to die here for sure.

80
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,760
Nor will any of you.

81
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,120
Pee Mak...

82
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,720
Pee Mak...

83
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,800
Pee Mak...

84
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,400
Why did you come out?
Get inside! Hurry up!

85
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:13,440
Pee Mak...

86
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,600
Pee Mak...

87
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,760
Pee Mak...

88
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,440
Pee Mak...

89
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,080
Too many people playing.
I won't let you in.

90
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,050
Why not.

91
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,190
No cash, no play.

92
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,290
Get on with it.

93
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,160
Are you going to shuffle until dawn?

94
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,570
Why don't you go put on a card show.

95
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,640
Is your dad David Blaine?

96
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,400
Hurry up. Come on.

97
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,400
Hey! What's this?

98
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,520
A natural 9.

99
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,280
Shit! I got 0.

100
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,160
What? I got 1, pay up.

101
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,240
What's wrong?

102
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,320
My wound hurts.

103
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,080
I can't believe that
you've survived.

104
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,640
Man, you must be invincible.

105
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:06,440
I'm grateful to all of you
for bringing me back here.

106
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,200
We're the one who should be grateful.

107
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,520
Without you Mark,
we'd be dead already.

108
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,400
Actually you should
pronounce my name as...

109
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,540
"MARK"

110
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,660
Huh?

111
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,640
Marrrrk?

112
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,650
Forget it. Just call me "Mak" then.

113
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:27,240
The only person who called me
"Mark" is my daddy.

114
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:31,170
But he's back in the USA
with the missionaries.

115
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,160
Everyone in my village calls me Mak.

116
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,360
You make my head spin!

117
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:39,160
Hey guys, we made it to Phra Khanong.

118
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,400
We're here?

119
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,930
Finally.

120
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,520
Where is everybody?

121
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,280
Thank you, Manoon.

122
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,200
You're welcome.

123
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,560
Nak!

124
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,760
Nak!

125
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,160
Nak, honey...

126
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,520
I'm back.

127
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,000
Nak.

128
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,530
Is Nak taking a shit?

129
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,540
Hey Nak...

130
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,080
Where were you?

131
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,240
I was really worried.

132
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,370
I thought I'd never see you again.

133
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,290
Don't cry baby.

134
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,280
You won't look handsome.

135
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,800
You know...

136
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,250
when I was at war,

137
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,400
I missed you so much.

138
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,680
I missed you a lot.

139
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:50,120
I missed so much!

140
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:52,900
I missed you more than
anyone in the world.

141
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,450
Man... Mak is pussy whipped!

142
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,640
Baby, did you miss me at all?

143
00:10:59,160 --> 00:10:59,920
No.

144
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,800
Why not?

145
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,920
Don't you love me anymore?

146
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,390
Are you crazy?

147
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:09,680
Of course I missed you.

148
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,120
You're mean.

149
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,230
Don't joke like that.

150
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,560
So cheesy.

151
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,120
Nak, what about our baby?

152
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,720
He's playing over there.

153
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,520
Where? Let daddy see.

154
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,530
Wow he is handsome
just like his daddy.

155
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,280
You know I gave him
your favourite name.

156
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,360
Really, Nak?

157
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,760
"Dang."

158
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,240
Dang, my boy.

159
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,800
What's so cool about the name Dang?

160
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,280
Go figure.

161
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,280
My servant has a cooler name.

162
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,080
Hey you guys.

163
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,240
This is my wife, Nak.

164
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:58,840
Hello there.

165
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,800
Nak, these are my friends.

166
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,120
This is Aey.

167
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,680
Ter, Puak and that's Shin.

168
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,000
And what are you guys going to do now?

169
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,040
I guess tonight will be
hard to find a boat.

170
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,410
We'll stay here for a night.

171
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,079
Why just one night?

172
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:16,680
You can stay here until
the war is over.

173
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,800
The house opposite us has been
empty since my Aunty passed away.

174
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,730
There's a boat for you to use too.

175
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:25,660
Shit...

176
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,960
His Aunty won't haunt us?

177
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,920
She'll haunt you till
your hair falls out.

178
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,040
We'll stay here for a night.
Don't want to be a bother.

179
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,040
Hey.

180
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:40,040
They're welcoming us
and you just turn them down?

181
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,400
You have no manners, Aey.

182
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:43,880
Right?

183
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,920
Mak's wife is so damn beautiful.

184
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,360
Hey... careful, that's
our friend's wife.

185
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:05,800
You know I'm a bad soldier.

186
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,160
How come?

187
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,550
When I was at war,

188
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,600
I never thought about Siam.

189
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,280
I never thought about my country.

190
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,920
I only thought about you.

191
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,960
This soldier should be
executed by a firing squad.

192
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,400
Yeah...

193
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,210
You should be.

194
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,760
You know,

195
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:39,250
I waited for you at
the pier every day.

196
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,770
I'm here now.

197
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,480
I promise that

198
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,600
I won't go anywhere anymore.

199
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,800
Hey.

200
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,800
Nak!

201
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,490
Does our house have
fireflies too?

202
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:24,720
Wow so beautiful.

203
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,280
That's a Krasue ghost.

204
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,280
What?

205
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,440
Nak.

206
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:39,040
Why are you joking with me like that?

207
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,400
You know I'm really scared of ghosts.

208
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:46,880
What are you looking for?

209
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,360
I'll wear my Buddha amulet.

210
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,880
The doctor took it off
when they bandaged me up.

211
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,560
Oh.

212
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,520
There's a lot of blood on it.
Just put it away for now

213
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,840
and I'll clean it later.

214
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,760
Okay.

215
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:09,280
My wife is the nicest person in Siam.

216
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,400
And you smell great too.

217
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:39,960
At this temple...

218
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:49,000
There are

219
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:53,760
seven toddy palm trees.

220
00:15:55,400 --> 00:16:02,500
The Hill Myna is out,

221
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:12,440
but hasn't returned.

222
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,640
Chirp.

223
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,640
Chirp.

224
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,890
Chirp.

225
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:57,010
Hey guys look.
They aren't scared of people.

226
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,160
Lovely, eh?

227
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,680
Yeah. So lovely.

228
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:03,120
- Lovely? My ass!
- Damn.

229
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:06,240
Do you have to be animal lover so early!
Can't you see we're still sleeping?

230
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:08,240
How can anybody sleep
with your chirping?

231
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,740
And this damn bird eating.

232
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,658
Go eat somewhere else.

233
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:13,120
Go away. Fly out of my house.

234
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,960
Hey wake up you guys.

235
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,410
You're here early.

236
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,120
Any later and the market'll close.

237
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:25,920
What's on the boat?

238
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,560
The bodies of soldier who died at war.

239
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,010
The cemetery is full.

240
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:34,879
So we have to return the bodies
to their families for burial.

241
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:54,780
Hey.

242
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:55,920
Keep rowing.

243
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,970
Uh!

244
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:15,680
Snakehead fish. Fresh! Big and small.
We've got them.

245
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:16,879
Wow.

246
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,290
Today the market's very crowded.

247
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,720
Hello.

248
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,560
Snacks?

249
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,170
We got desserts and cookies too.

250
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,080
Aunty Nim.

251
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,560
May I have 2 cookies and 2 of those snacks?

252
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,040
- Mak.
- Yes?

253
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,130
We're all out.

254
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:41,920
Damn it. We won't get to eat any.

255
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,800
Uncle Aum. Uncle Aum.

256
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,360
Mak...

257
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,080
I want to buy some fish for Nak.

258
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,680
I'm not selling any!

259
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,240
Today is a Buddhist holy day.
I'm releasing them.

260
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,480
Sathu. Go go go.

261
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,660
Don't get in the way.

262
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,360
Do you think he did that right?

263
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,400
What got into him?

264
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:08,171
Liquor store.

265
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,440
Aunty Priek... Aunty Priek.

266
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,480
Wake up! There's customers here!

267
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,470
Aunty Priek.

268
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,600
Don't you remember me?

269
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,320
Have you got any work for me?

270
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,000
None.

271
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,480
Fucking nothing.

272
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:33,000
How many staff do you think
we need for a small liquor store?

273
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:38,000
You think I need salesmen?
Mixers? Waiters?

274
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,439
Hostesses?

275
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,880
Bartenders? Dishwashers? Bus boys?

276
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,860
I've got them all already.

277
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,320
Please drink up.

278
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,520
She's even got an escort.

279
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:53,960
Very good.

280
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,360
You look familiar.

281
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,639
I'm Mak.

282
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,000
I just got back from the war.

283
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:02,760
If I didn't meet Nak first,
I'd probably hit on you.

284
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,078
You're looking good.

285
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:05,160
As pretty as your ghost!

286
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,640
You really don't know Mak?

287
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,920
If you want to know,

288
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,320
bend down and look between your legs.
You'll see that Nak and your kid are...

289
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,640
Mom.

290
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,160
- Shut up!
- Ping.

291
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,240
- You're drunk. Go rest.
- I'm not drunk.

292
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,598
- Why won't you let me go?
- Go. Get up. I'm not drunk.

293
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:23,840
I'm sorry.
When she's drunk she talks nonsense.

294
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:27,240
- Get inside.
- Nak! Nak!

295
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,520
Nak! Let her come. I'm not scared!

296
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:32,240
Nak... Let her come.

297
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,520
What's wrong with her?

298
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,020
Don't you think
everyone's acting weird?

299
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:47,080
Yeah. What did Aunty
Priek mean anyway?

300
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,240
Why do you have to
look between your legs?

301
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:51,520
Yoga exercise?

302
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,400
My mom once told me,

303
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,960
if you look between your legs

304
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,480
you can tell if there's ghosts.

305
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,170
You mean...

306
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,040
Nak's a ghost?

307
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,850
That's crazy.

308
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,480
She's too hot to be a ghost.

309
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:23,600
Yeah, as beautiful as that, even
if she's a ghost I'd still have her.

310
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,960
Why did she
talk to Mak like that?

311
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,569
Because she was wasted.

312
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:31,160
So everything she says is nonsense.

313
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,760
Where the hell is Mak?

314
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,960
How come he isn't here
drinking with us?

315
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,040
You asshole, Aey,

316
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,280
you've spilt all the booze.

317
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,240
You go get Mak to come here.

318
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,200
Hurry up.

319
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,079
Why me? I'm scared.

320
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,701
Because you drank the least.

321
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,481
It's been over an hour and you
didn't even finish one glass.

322
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:51,580
Right...

323
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,240
We're all drunk, so you go.

324
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,280
Fucking shit.

325
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,840
Get going...

326
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,000
Mak!

327
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,000
Mak!

328
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:58,120
Nak is Mak here?

329
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:18,760
Hey Shin.

330
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,360
Nak.

331
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,600
Is Mak here?

332
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,640
He's sleeping.

333
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,480
I'll wake him for you.

334
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:28,760
Please come in first.

335
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,400
Where's Dang?

336
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,920
Nak, are you okay?

337
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,160
You ran out of coconut husks?

338
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,880
Shin! What the hell is wrong with you?

339
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,600
Puak. Slap me... please!

340
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,620
Oy...

341
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:03,979
That was hard.

342
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:04,680
You told me to.

343
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,010
Where the hell is Mak?

344
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:11,440
How come he isn't here drinking with us?

345
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,700
Aey, you asshole,

346
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,080
You've spilt the booze.

347
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,880
Shit. Deja vu.

348
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,520
What do you mean deja vu?

349
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,080
You go get Mak over here. Hurry up!

350
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,360
No. Why me?

351
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,920
What are you scared of?

352
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:32,640
If Nak is really a ghost,
then kiss her like this.

353
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,170
There's no such thing as ghosts.

354
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,248
You wanna bet?

355
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,681
You won't get me this time.

356
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:15,290
The war drums sound like rolling thunder
as we set out to protect our homeland.

357
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:19,290
Our thirst for battle is greater even
if there's no elephants to ride.

358
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:23,238
Dusk fills my emptiness with thoughts
of love for my beautiful dearest.

359
00:26:23,339 --> 00:26:26,179
Roused to the point of release I raise
my white flag in sweet surrender.

360
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,640
I get a rag out to
polish the sword. Yay!

361
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,000
What's with you, Shin?

362
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,680
Where's Mak?

363
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:35,640
Nak's a ghost!

364
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,720
Nak's really a ghost!

365
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:39,839
What are you babbling about?

366
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,441
If you're drunk.
Go vomit somewhere else.

367
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,718
Really I went up to Mak's house.

368
00:26:43,719 --> 00:26:45,280
His house looks
rundown and abandoned.

369
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,080
Maybe Nak's feeling lazy.

370
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,720
But the crib was swinging by itself.

371
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:53,330
Maybe there's a strong breeze.

372
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,690
You're imagining things.

373
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,679
I wasn't!

374
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:59,480
I saw Nak upstairs but she could
reach the ground to grab a lime.

375
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:11,040
Maybe one of her arms is
longer than the other?

376
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:14,080
Don't you know our arms
aren't exactly the same length?

377
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:16,960
Look at mine. See?
They're not the same.

378
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:25,160
Or maybe Nak is just using
a stick to pick it up.

379
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,770
You're drunk and your imagination
got the best of you.

380
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:31,330
Hey! Do you remember
our marching song?

381
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,880
Let's dance. Ready.

382
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:37,330
The war drums sound like rolling thunder
as we set out to protect our homeland.

383
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:41,080
Our thirst for battle is greater even
if there's no elephants to ride.

384
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:44,400
Dusk fills my emptiness with thoughts
of love for my beautiful dearest.

385
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:52,840
Mak.

386
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,320
Can't we sleep a bit longer?

387
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,200
Come on. Help me.

388
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,480
I don't know what's going
with the villagers.

389
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,720
Only you guys have been kind to me.

390
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,560
Hey, Shin.

391
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,440
Aren't you done freaking out?

392
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:18,840
What's wrong with you?

393
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,360
Ter, get up and help us.

394
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,160
Yeah Ter...

395
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,279
go get the axe and help Puak.

396
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:25,280
Ask Mak where the axe is.

397
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:28,520
What now?

398
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:42,958
I went up to Mak's house.

399
00:28:42,959 --> 00:28:44,520
His house looks rundown
and abandoned.

400
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,520
My mom once told me,

401
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,810
if you look between your legs,

402
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,090
you can see if their's any ghosts.

403
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,320
Uh... I'm

404
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,480
looking for the axe.
Do you know where it is?

405
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,200
Shin.

406
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:51,081
I looked between my legs.
I didn't see a thing.

407
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,560
So stop freaking out.

408
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:55,640
Really?

409
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,620
Yes.

410
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:57,840
How's that possible?

411
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,200
Eh...

412
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:37,900
Eh!

413
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:43,440
Damn, I'm not even finished shitting.

414
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,240
Shit! I saw a body behind the house!

415
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,760
Hey Ter.
What happened to your face?

416
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,640
I saw a body behind the house!

417
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,660
What?

418
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,840
There's a body behind the house!

419
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,240
What the fuck is he mumbling about?

420
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,480
Thank you.

421
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,770
Oh my...

422
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,080
Nak is a ghost!

423
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,240
What are you talking about?

424
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,110
Nak

425
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,080
is

426
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,400
a...

427
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,440
What's going on?

428
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:48,640
What's wrong with your face Ter?

429
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:50,560
Whoa!

430
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,880
Hey did you get stung by bees?

431
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,559
My mom told me

432
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:56,520
to use herbs to heal it.

433
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,160
Nak, can you make some?

434
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:02,960
Let me see.

435
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:05,680
Thank you.

436
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,640
Mind your step.

437
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,519
Nak's a ghost!

438
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,720
I saw a body behind the house.

439
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,181
She really is a ghost!

440
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,840
Ter, stop talking crap.

441
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,960
What are you saying?

442
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,680
Pumpee Pocpoo. I can't understand.

443
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:48,680
Nak's a ghost.

444
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,200
Hey you guys!

445
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:05,880
It's raining! Just go inside!

446
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,580
Ter!

447
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:09,960
What happened to your face?

448
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,080
What paper is that?

449
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,120
Bee sting.

450
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:22,399
Let's see it.

451
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,299
See what?

452
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:24,260
The paper.

453
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:27,160
What paper? I don't have any.

454
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,160
Ter.

455
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:33,999
Bee sting.

456
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:34,840
Let me see the paper.

457
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:35,600
Bee sting.

458
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,760
Let me see it now.

459
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:38,080
Ter.

460
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,320
Ter.

461
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:56,480
He said "It's about to rain.
His clothes drying outside."

462
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:59,180
He'll go home now.

463
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,280
Puak how did you make sense of that?

464
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,360
I don't know.

465
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:04,920
Let's go get those damn clothes.

466
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:15,240
I almost flirted with a ghost.

467
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:16,960
What are you doing?

468
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,960
Packing my stuff and leaving.
We can't stay here.

469
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,770
Are you sure, Ter?

470
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,760
Of course.
I saw it with my own eyes.

471
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,240
The ruby ring is exactly like Nak's.

472
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:28,480
Is the ruby big?

473
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,160
Jerk. That's not the point.

474
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:33,800
When you looked between her legs
why you didn't see anything, Ter?

475
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:34,839
I don't know.

476
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,401
I looked there but I
didn't see a thing,

477
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:37,798
except her hot pot.

478
00:34:37,799 --> 00:34:38,599
What?

479
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,850
I mean the pot in the kitchen.

480
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,599
- Oh...
- You idiot!

481
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,441
You're supposed to look
between your legs!

482
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:46,960
Oh really?

483
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:50,840
Why didn't you say so.

484
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:51,840
Huh?

485
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,410
Do you think Mak can read?

486
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,510
Of course.

487
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:03,440
He looked really shocked.

488
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,190
Look, he went inside.

489
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,240
I know everything already.

490
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,370
Why didn't you tell me?

491
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,080
Did you think I'd be disgusted?

492
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:38,090
Who told you?

493
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,840
Whoever told me isn't important.

494
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,920
We promised each other

495
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,760
there wouldn't be any
secrets between us.

496
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,320
I didn't know how to tell you.

497
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,600
Are you listening to yourself?

498
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,040
What if you couldn't take it?

499
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:03,440
Why wouldn't I take it?

500
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,080
I used to be like that too.

501
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,530
If he knows the truth,
why does he look so in love?

502
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:14,600
I know.

503
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,950
Shit... I know why.

504
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,760
He says Nak is "gross" not a ghost!

505
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,440
If she is gross

506
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,200
then so what?

507
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:29,080
But if you are really
gross that's disgusting.

508
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,530
You've never had an under arm zit?

509
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,240
I had one last year and it was gross.

510
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,400
Shit, we're wasting time.

511
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:37,040
Let's pack up and get out of here.
Hurry up!

512
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,800
Hey why are you taking so long Ter?

513
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:48,880
Hurry!

514
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,640
I can't abandon him.

515
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,520
What's wrong with you now?

516
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,360
Leave Mak with a ghost?

517
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:13,240
- I'm not going.
- No way.

518
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,880
You saw Nak with her long arm.

519
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,210
So you go tell Mak.

520
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:25,800
How can someone that
beautiful be a ghost?

521
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,480
Anyone here?

522
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,190
Anyone home?

523
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,520
Hey Ping.

524
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,400
Why are you crying?

525
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,680
Can anyone help me slaughter my cow?

526
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:41,760
I'm sorry too.

527
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,800
You must really love your cow.

528
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,520
When you're hungry you can
eat anything. Don't think too much.

529
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:49,440
- I once ate my dog.
- It's not like that.

530
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:52,240
The cow is for a funeral offering.

531
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:54,240
Whose funeral?

532
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,320
My mom.

533
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,000
Aunty Priek is dead?

534
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,400
That day at the market.

535
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:02,590
When she told Mak about Nak.

536
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,400
Nak was very angry and killed her.

537
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:07,120
Her body was found
floating this morning.

538
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,080
Shin and Ter?

539
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,110
Damn it.

540
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:19,920
Mak.

541
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:21,520
Mak.

542
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,960
Hey.

543
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
What's up?

544
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,159
Mak,

545
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:30,160
I have something to tell you.
Do you know that

546
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,200
your know you wife is...

547
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:43,480
your wife is beautiful!

548
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:45,840
What's up with you?

549
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,240
Oh yes,

550
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:58,080
I wanted to say that
your wife is very good looking,

551
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,280
like Miss Universe.

552
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:02,080
I just couldn't wait to tell you.

553
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,600
Wow you guys are so sweet.

554
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,360
You didn't have to make
it into a big deal.

555
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:11,520
Oh no. We had to tell you now.

556
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:13,120
Next time, there's no need to rush.

557
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,400
My wife will still be pretty tomorrow.

558
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:18,600
See you.

559
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:19,140
Pee Mak.

560
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:23,250
Why don't you invite your
friends to eat here?

561
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,240
Make yourself at home.
No need to be too formal.

562
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:31,120
Go on.

563
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,250
Everything is delicious.

564
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:35,680
Yeah.

565
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,800
I saw your mouth watering.

566
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:39,170
So eat up.

567
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,160
We're full already.

568
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,559
Really?

569
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:50,280
Yeah. There was a
buffet at the market.

570
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:53,600
Come on.

571
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:56,240
Nak will be sad.

572
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,600
She worked so hard in the kitchen.

573
00:39:58,640 --> 00:39:59,720
That's okay. Next time.

574
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,400
Okay... up to you.

575
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:04,000
I'll eat myself.
You guys are missing out.

576
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,890
I shouldn't have eaten so much.

577
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:12,120
On second thought we
should have a bite.

578
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,960
Wow! This dish looks good.

579
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,280
I'll try a bit.

580
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,380
Here you go.

581
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,270
Very nice... delicious.

582
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:38,760
I told you.

583
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,250
You must try this one.

584
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,720
- Huh?
- Try this.

585
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,400
Try it.

586
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:50,480
Puak eat it.

587
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,120
Just try it.

588
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,360
Eat up.

589
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,760
Yeah... just taste it.

590
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:04,520
Mmm...

591
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,970
Where did you learn to cook, Nak?

592
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,490
Le Cordon Bleu?

593
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,400
Shin why don't you eat anything?

594
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:20,840
Yeah Shin. This one is yours.

595
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:24,080
That is Nak's signature dish.

596
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,560
Go for it Shin.

597
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:32,730
Yeah... a big bite.

598
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:55,480
How was it?

599
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:59,000
Damn good!

600
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,560
My Nak is the best cook.

601
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:06,160
Hey, anyone wants to hold Dang?

602
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:09,180
Hey!

603
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:17,720
My Dang. My son.

604
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:21,280
Peekaboo! What's up baby?

605
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:22,920
Want to play with Uncle Shin?

606
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:29,080
Oh yeah Shin. You love kids.

607
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:32,680
Let's play with Uncle Shin.

608
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:34,440
Here we go.

609
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:36,240
My boy.

610
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:44,520
Oh Shin. Dang really likes you.

611
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:48,400
Kiss me Uncle Shin.

612
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,680
Kiss me Uncle Shin.

613
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:53,880
Kiss me Uncle Shin.

614
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:00,720
See he keeps smiling now.

615
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:02,320
Come to daddy.

616
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:04,800
Come here.

617
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:08,520
Let's go!

618
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:09,780
- Go? - Go home!

619
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:14,700
What are you doing?

620
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:16,360
Oh...

621
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:18,520
I know

622
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:20,840
you guys

623
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:23,600
feel like playing charades?

624
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,040
Like we did at war right?

625
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:26,570
Okay, I like that idea.

626
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:28,800
Nak, please join us.

627
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:29,720
Let's play charades.

628
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:30,560
Charades. Okay?

629
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:39,990
Hurry up Shin.

630
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:42,320
Just watch me.

631
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:48,680
Throw?

632
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,320
Javelin?

633
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:51,240
Athlete?

634
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:56,120
Throw?

635
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:57,799
Throw away?

636
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:58,300
Trout?

637
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:00,840
No?

638
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:03,280
Trout?

639
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:04,440
What?

640
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:08,920
Kitchen.

641
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:09,680
Kitchen?

642
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:11,840
Oh... a cook?

643
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:12,840
A beautiful cook?

644
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:14,990
Damn what the hell?

645
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:15,880
Nak's kitchen?

646
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:17,480
Mak's kitchen.

647
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:18,820
No.

648
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:19,840
Mak and Nak's kitchen?

649
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:21,120
No?

650
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:23,520
Will he guess right in this life time?

651
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:25,360
Pan?

652
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:26,600
Knife?

653
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:27,880
Spear?

654
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:28,900
Correct!

655
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:30,960
I told you so!

656
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,079
What's with the spear?

657
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:34,080
Body?

658
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:35,440
Armpit?

659
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:37,440
Armpit hair?

660
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:38,660
No!

661
00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:39,680
Sweaty armpit?

662
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:40,760
Smelly armpit?

663
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:42,160
No!

664
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:43,160
Bumpy armpits!

665
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:44,640
No!

666
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:45,640
Not that either!

667
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:46,760
Ooh!

668
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:48,920
I wonder what Mak's IQ really is?

669
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:51,240
What is it? A bed?

670
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:52,960
A bed, right?

671
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:54,080
Bamboo bed?

672
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:54,880
Correct!

673
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:57,760
"A spear near the bed" (Danger nearby)

674
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:58,780
That's right!

675
00:44:59,020 --> 00:45:01,520
Yay...

676
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:03,250
Who the hell came up
with that phrase?

677
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:05,320
You dad must be Shakespeare.
That one was hard.

678
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:10,490
A bird?
Fly?

679
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:11,480
Bat?

680
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:18,880
- Shirt?
- Correct!

681
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:19,880
Dog?

682
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:22,479
Tongue?

683
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:23,420
Dog tongue fish?

684
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:26,760
Dog tongue fish wears a shirt?

685
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:28,320
What the hell is it?

686
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:32,440
Ter, what is it?

687
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,360
- Oh Nak?
- No.

688
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:38,240
Beautiful?

689
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:39,260
Sexy?

690
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:40,140
What?

691
00:45:40,180 --> 00:45:40,700
Woman?

692
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:43,060
Wife?

693
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:48,880
Oh, I know.

694
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:51,439
"Dead-shirt" (Desert)

695
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:52,340
Correct!

696
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:00,040
So easy, Ter.

697
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:01,490
This is a shirt and she is dead.

698
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:03,720
Dead-shirt, pronounce as "Desert".

699
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:07,570
No. That can't be right.

700
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,490
Shin's answer is wrong, right?

701
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:12,680
Yeah... Shin is wrong.

702
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:14,570
How can it be wrong?

703
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:17,000
This is a shirt and she's dead!
So it's "dead-shirt" (Desert)

704
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:18,480
Yay...

705
00:46:18,620 --> 00:46:20,660
Something's wrong with your brain!

706
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:22,160
What is going on?

707
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:23,840
So what's the answer?

708
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:25,360
Let me see the paper.

709
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:29,640
What are you doing Ter?

710
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:31,800
I'm still very hungry.

711
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:33,400
Oh I just realized

712
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:35,540
I was cooking rice at home.
I'd better go check.

713
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:37,240
Yeah I was about to remind him too.

714
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:38,770
So let's go before it burns.

715
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:40,000
Hurry up!

716
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:41,680
- How about the shirt?
- Forget about it.

717
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:43,320
Why don't you tell
me the answer first?

718
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:45,500
I've given the right answer.

719
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:47,200
Right my ass. That was only close.

720
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:48,160
Hold on!

721
00:46:58,400 --> 00:46:59,400
Shin hurry up.

722
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:03,180
Shin come on.

723
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:04,120
Wait up.

724
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:05,000
Holy shit.

725
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:07,920
Shin hurry up.

726
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:10,000
Hey wait up!

727
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:12,850
Ter hurry. Ter!

728
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:18,400
She's right behind you!

729
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:20,320
Come on Ter. Hurry up!

730
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:27,200
Ter untie the boat. Let's go!

731
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:28,520
Paddle hard.

732
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:36,360
Why the hell are we turning?

733
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:38,800
Shit! We're back here again!

734
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:41,480
Go that way!

735
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:49,880
Why are you turning again?

736
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:53,878
Where are you guys
going in such a hurry?

737
00:47:53,879 --> 00:47:55,240
Don't you want to finish the game?

738
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:58,210
I didn't get a chance to play yet.

739
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:00,680
So what phrase would you act out?

740
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:04,360
MYOB

741
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:06,800
Puak, what does it mean?

742
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:08,678
It means "Mind your own business!"

743
00:48:08,679 --> 00:48:09,679
Did you even have to ask?

744
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:11,560
Just go!

745
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:25,200
Damn it. I think Nak
is onto us for sure.

746
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:28,210
She won't let us live.

747
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:33,320
What?

748
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:36,200
You go check.

749
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,680
You guys get out of
my house right now.

750
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:01,038
What's wrong with you Mak?

751
00:49:01,039 --> 00:49:02,919
You guys are no different
than the villagers,

752
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:05,330
who think that my wife is a ghost.

753
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:07,638
You have to listen to us.

754
00:49:07,639 --> 00:49:08,960
Your wife really died already.

755
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:10,359
Everybody knows it.

756
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:11,661
My wife isn't dead.

757
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:13,760
Ping lied to all the villagers.

758
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:15,360
They said when I was at war.

759
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:17,210
Ping tried to seduce Nak.

760
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:21,680
When I didn't show any interest,

761
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:25,090
he bad-mouthed me

762
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:28,120
by telling all kinds of lies.

763
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:35,160
Everyone believed him.

764
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:40,120
Now everybody hates Mak too.

765
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:42,040
I get the picture,

766
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:43,980
but you didn't have
to change your voice.

767
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:45,199
So that's it.

768
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:46,400
So Ping fooled all of you too.

769
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:48,098
You're the one who's being fooled.

770
00:49:48,099 --> 00:49:48,780
Watch your mouth!

771
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:50,840
Stop being an idiot.

772
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:51,801
You have to believe us.

773
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:53,800
We are telling you this

774
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:56,000
because you're our friend.

775
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:57,401
I don't need any friends like you!

776
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:00,160
Mak!

777
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:01,150
Mak!

778
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:06,680
I think...

779
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:09,400
we'll really need to
do something drastic.

780
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:18,990
I kicked them all out already.

781
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:30,999
What did your friends say?

782
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,081
I don't care what they say.

783
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:34,920
They can't talk about you like that.

784
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:52,640
If you're really a ghost

785
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:55,480
then I should be able
to see through you.

786
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:57,380
Let me try.

787
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:00,520
Hey...

788
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:01,800
I can see past you.

789
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:02,880
Hey.

790
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:04,320
Hey.

791
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:06,720
Super cool.

792
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:08,480
Enough.

793
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:12,799
What did you do

794
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:13,520
to get this dirty?

795
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:20,270
Let's see what my darling
prepared for me to eat.

796
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:24,520
Mmm...

797
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:27,890
your cooking is as good as ever.

798
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,680
Nak... you're too beautiful like this

799
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:36,080
to be a ghost. Right?

800
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:01,720
Wait up!

801
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:06,020
A Ghost!

802
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:09,600
Why don't you try to scare me?

803
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:11,321
C'mon stick your tongue out.

804
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:13,000
Scare me.

805
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:15,800
You're no fun. Boo!

806
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:17,840
Damn fatso...
don't make me smack your head.

807
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:22,520
Are you really going
to wear that mask?

808
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:24,500
Why not?

809
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:25,880
It's kind of funny.

810
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:27,000
Okay.

811
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:36,620
I begin to get sad,
looking across the sky.

812
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:43,720
It's nearly dawn, the light is faint.

813
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:50,720
I know our time is coming to an end.

814
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:57,740
My heart is breaking but I
don't know what else to do.

815
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:03,319
I want to cry...

816
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:05,280
and beg time to go by slowly...
I need more time.

817
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:20,380
To look at each other.
I wish I could freeze this moment

818
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:26,410
forever before we have to part.

819
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:33,280
If Dang wakes up and no
one's home won't he cry?

820
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:34,550
Don't worry.

821
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:36,880
Dang doesn't wake up in
the middle of the night.

822
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:42,440
Look over there!

823
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:45,678
10 cents per ball.

824
00:53:45,679 --> 00:53:47,759
If you can knock them all
down, you'll win a doll.

825
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:49,800
Baby, watch this.

826
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:54,681
I'm just warming up.

827
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:56,640
This next one for sure.

828
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:00,100
Almost.

829
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:03,340
This is the one.

830
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:07,050
Go! Yay... I hit it.

831
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:10,170
Again!

832
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:28,290
Baby, look... fireworks.

833
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:31,390
Wow.

834
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:38,720
See Nak,

835
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:41,480
I told you. I can aim good.
I'll get you a doll.

836
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:44,601
Told you. Even as a kid I
could always aim good.

837
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,280
Oh... so many people.

838
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:52,050
We'll have to skip the ride.

839
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:54,290
Let's go play something else.

840
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:04,930
Look, there's no cue.

841
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:11,480
Hey! You're right.

842
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:24,920
Nak...

843
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:28,200
Do you love me?

844
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:31,280
What kind of question is that?

845
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:34,000
Why?

846
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:35,730
Don't you love me anymore?

847
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:39,640
I love you.

848
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:40,920
Too much?

849
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:44,860
Lots...

850
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:47,610
Love me too much?

851
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:56,000
Hey baby, look!

852
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:57,760
There's a haunted house too.

853
00:55:58,520 --> 00:55:59,610
We can go after this.

854
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:05,680
Aren't you scared of ghosts?

855
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:08,380
Who's scared?

856
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:10,360
Where?

857
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:13,440
Come on out. Ghosts?
There's nothing to be scared of.

858
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:21,220
Baby.

859
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:25,200
If one day I die

860
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:27,640
can you live without me?

861
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:30,960
Why are you asking me this?

862
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:33,330
Just tell me. I want to know.

863
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:41,280
No.

864
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:43,080
If anyone's going to die

865
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:45,560
then I want to die first.

866
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:49,240
If I don't have you. I can't go on.

867
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:00,210
But if I die first,

868
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:02,880
you'd be able to find
a new husband easily

869
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:05,330
with that big ass of yours!

870
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:23,360
Haunted house.

871
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:24,880
- Please keep the doll for me.
- Okay.

872
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:27,140
Let's go, baby.

873
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:31,520
What kind of a ghost
goes in a haunted house.

874
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:34,360
So who will be scaring who?

875
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:35,880
I brought some powerful magic.

876
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:38,280
Like what?

877
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:41,880
Holy rice. I got it from a monk.

878
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:45,200
- Very sacred.
- Very good.

879
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:48,000
By the way, where is Aey?

880
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:49,620
Where is he?

881
00:57:49,780 --> 00:57:50,680
Hey.

882
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:52,678
Where have you been, Aey?

883
00:57:52,779 --> 00:57:53,979
I had diarrhea.

884
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:56,130
You were gone a long time.

885
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:01,280
Baby, don't be scared.

886
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:23,680
Play with me. Play with me.

887
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:31,250
Aah!

888
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:45,480
I think I screamed too loud.
So I scared him away.

889
00:58:57,600 --> 00:59:00,000
Sorry Mak, this is for your own good.

890
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:03,880
- Play with me.
- Shin you're the look out.

891
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:10,760
- Hurry up Ter.
- Puak hold his legs.

892
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:19,170
It's stuck.

893
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:24,960
Shit.

894
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:27,520
She's onto us.

895
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:30,730
What are we going to do?
The door is stuck.

896
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:35,260
Shit!

897
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:38,000
Too late. She's coming.

898
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:40,560
What now?

899
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:41,930
I have no idea.

900
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:28,380
Hey!

901
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:30,310
Why are you jumping?

902
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:34,320
That damn boy did.
He was so energetic.

903
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:43,360
Play with me.

904
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:46,680
Play with me. Play with me.

905
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:47,920
Play with me.

906
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:51,640
Play with me. Play with me.

907
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:56,000
Play with me. Play with me.

908
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:00,360
You don't have to.

909
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:02,250
It's up to you.

910
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:25,130
You think Nak was fooled?

911
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:47,840
Too many props.

912
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:54,280
What the hell?

913
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:07,760
Hey!

914
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:10,010
You guys aren't customers!

915
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:14,330
Or did you get off work already?

916
01:02:16,360 --> 01:02:17,481
Why doesn't anybody tell me?

917
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:20,320
Damn it.
Letting me hang upside down that long

918
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:22,438
might give me a stroke and kill me.

919
01:02:22,439 --> 01:02:23,359
Okay, let's go home.

920
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:25,580
Go.

921
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:30,400
Hey! You over there. Time to go home.

922
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:32,801
The one who dressed
up like Nak's ghost.

923
01:02:33,120 --> 01:02:35,560
Wow so trendy.

924
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:37,640
Are you new here?

925
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:38,840
Let's go home.

926
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:50,278
Ter, where's the holy rice?
The rice. Hurry up!

927
01:02:50,279 --> 01:02:51,279
Come on.

928
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:13,000
What the hell are you screaming for?

929
01:03:15,080 --> 01:03:16,800
It's just a fake hand.

930
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:20,400
Screaming like that freaks me out.
Look.

931
01:03:22,600 --> 01:03:24,560
- Hey untie him.
- Come on.

932
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:27,030
What's going on?

933
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:29,470
Nak is really a ghost!

934
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:31,990
Not again. It's all in your heads.

935
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:33,440
Just like this hand.

936
01:03:47,720 --> 01:03:49,159
Mak come here.

937
01:03:49,160 --> 01:03:50,160
What is it now?

938
01:03:50,260 --> 01:03:51,380
Shit, you scared me.

939
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:06,270
Holy shit.

940
01:04:13,120 --> 01:04:14,160
A lizard!

941
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:16,240
I thought you saw...

942
01:04:16,280 --> 01:04:17,190
Her!

943
01:04:21,240 --> 01:04:22,570
There are others around here?

944
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:26,360
You guys won't let this go.

945
01:04:27,320 --> 01:04:28,440
We're telling the truth.

946
01:04:28,680 --> 01:04:31,060
If you don't believe us then
try looking between her legs.

947
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:33,480
I did and saw nothing.

948
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:34,720
Maybe you didn't do it right.

949
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:37,600
You have to look down between your own legs

950
01:04:37,640 --> 01:04:39,319
not between Nak's legs!

951
01:04:39,320 --> 01:04:40,420
Of course.

952
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:42,050
Who would be that stupid!

953
01:04:48,520 --> 01:04:49,880
My wife isn't dead yet.

954
01:04:52,040 --> 01:04:53,720
Hey Mak... wait up!

955
01:04:53,730 --> 01:04:54,920
Mak where are you going?

956
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:58,720
How come he looked and
didn't see anything?

957
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:02,590
Mak!

958
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:04,240
Mak! Where are you?

959
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:06,410
Mak!

960
01:05:10,360 --> 01:05:11,420
Shit.

961
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:13,840
Is this Mak's blood?

962
01:05:19,240 --> 01:05:20,320
Shit.

963
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:24,680
Help me.

964
01:05:25,120 --> 01:05:26,200
Mak, is that you?

965
01:05:27,120 --> 01:05:28,400
Are you okay?

966
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:37,010
Help me.

967
01:05:38,040 --> 01:05:38,960
I'm hurt.

968
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:40,940
Help me.

969
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:42,960
Mak.

970
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:46,840
Help me.

971
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:48,760
Help me.

972
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:50,330
Mak.

973
01:05:52,040 --> 01:05:52,810
What's wrong?

974
01:05:54,080 --> 01:05:55,360
I'm in pain!

975
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:56,800
Where?

976
01:05:57,240 --> 01:05:59,970
Shit! His wound's bleeding.

977
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,650
You've had this wound for so long
how come it's not healed yet?

978
01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:04,640
Do you have something to pressure it?

979
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:05,960
Shin,

980
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:07,330
something isn't right here?

981
01:06:07,360 --> 01:06:08,410
Yeah, I know.

982
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:11,600
It's way to past the
rainy season, right?

983
01:06:11,720 --> 01:06:13,400
You idiot. Not about that!

984
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:17,420
About Mak looking down between his
legs and not seeing anything.

985
01:06:19,960 --> 01:06:20,980
So it means...

986
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:23,320
Nak is still alive.

987
01:06:26,360 --> 01:06:28,121
But the body I saw in the backyard,

988
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:29,760
has the same ring as Nak's.

989
01:06:33,120 --> 01:06:34,758
Shit, come to think of it,

990
01:06:34,759 --> 01:06:37,079
The ring I saw is on the ring
finger of her left hand.

991
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:40,520
So what?

992
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:42,290
It's a wedding ring.

993
01:06:43,480 --> 01:06:44,560
So that means that

994
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:45,960
Mak should be wearing one too!

995
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:00,280
Softly.

996
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:06,440
Ter, what are you doing?

997
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:09,130
Damn Ter! What the hell are you doing?
You're hurting him!

998
01:07:09,160 --> 01:07:11,120
Ter. Mak's wound is still raw.

999
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:33,199
Damn Mak, you scared me.

1000
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:34,440
I thought you had your ring on.

1001
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:37,000
My wedding ring?

1002
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:40,480
Well my hand hurts
so I wear it around my neck instead.

1003
01:07:46,520 --> 01:07:48,160
The bodies of soldiers
who died at war.

1004
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:49,560
The cemetery is full now.

1005
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:52,070
So we must return the bodies
to their family to bury.

1006
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:56,680
You've had this wound for so long
how come it's not healed yet?

1007
01:07:58,320 --> 01:08:00,720
No matter what I will make it
back to see my wife and baby.

1008
01:08:13,600 --> 01:08:15,250
Run! What?

1009
01:08:15,320 --> 01:08:17,239
It's him. Run!

1010
01:08:17,440 --> 01:08:18,600
Ter, what the hell?

1011
01:08:23,360 --> 01:08:24,720
What the hell?

1012
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:26,310
Wait for me.

1013
01:08:40,160 --> 01:08:42,630
Shit! The body I saw was Mak.

1014
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:45,320
I've been living with a
ghost all this time?

1015
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:49,040
So Nak really has been
bad-mouthed then.

1016
01:08:49,760 --> 01:08:52,730
What about when I saw Nak's arm
stretch all the way to the ground?

1017
01:08:58,300 --> 01:08:59,260
Or...

1018
01:09:00,160 --> 01:09:04,000
maybe Nak used a long
stick to get the lime.

1019
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:09,200
Yeah, it must be that spear then.

1020
01:09:09,240 --> 01:09:10,320
Damn it.

1021
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:12,320
Are you sure

1022
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:14,190
that Nak's alive?

1023
01:09:17,480 --> 01:09:19,280
Then we have to take her with us.

1024
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:21,200
You really want to risk that?

1025
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:24,720
How could we leave her like that?

1026
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:27,520
A woman all alone and so vulnerable.

1027
01:09:29,160 --> 01:09:31,160
I don't care. No matter what...

1028
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:33,120
Nak and I will run away together.

1029
01:09:33,160 --> 01:09:34,140
Huh?

1030
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:36,840
I mean run away with us.

1031
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:39,641
Always thinking with your brain in
your pants. I can't do that man.

1032
01:09:40,200 --> 01:09:41,100
Hey!

1033
01:09:41,160 --> 01:09:42,650
But Puak does have a point.

1034
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:44,280
If one day.

1035
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:47,520
Nak is haunted to death.

1036
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:50,200
We're all partially to blame

1037
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:58,480
for not lifting a finger to help.

1038
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,360
The living cannot live with the dead!

1039
01:10:07,640 --> 01:10:08,640
Hurry up.

1040
01:10:09,400 --> 01:10:10,300
Nak!

1041
01:10:13,900 --> 01:10:14,800
Nak!

1042
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:18,500
Nak!

1043
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:29,680
It's been a while, how are you?

1044
01:10:32,200 --> 01:10:33,560
I'm so sick of those villagers.

1045
01:10:33,960 --> 01:10:35,040
Idiots.

1046
01:10:35,080 --> 01:10:37,199
How could they believe Ping.

1047
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:39,510
I tried to talk to them
but they wouldn't listen.

1048
01:10:39,660 --> 01:10:41,780
I just busted more than
a few lips on your behalf.

1049
01:10:43,160 --> 01:10:44,760
Please accept our apology.

1050
01:10:45,200 --> 01:10:47,640
Now we have no doubts
about you being alive.

1051
01:10:50,120 --> 01:10:50,920
That's okay.

1052
01:10:55,160 --> 01:10:57,080
Shin. What are you scared of now?

1053
01:10:57,280 --> 01:10:57,920
Come here.

1054
01:10:59,160 --> 01:11:00,360
Here...

1055
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:02,560
Touch her. Trust me.

1056
01:11:03,680 --> 01:11:04,680
Come on.

1057
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:12,000
You can actually touch her.

1058
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:15,040
What ghost has skin that smooth?

1059
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:18,718
What about those dried leaves?

1060
01:11:18,719 --> 01:11:19,619
Damn you.

1061
01:11:20,680 --> 01:11:23,640
She's health conscious. How do you
think she has such a nice figure?

1062
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:26,480
Everyone eats organic foods now.

1063
01:11:27,320 --> 01:11:28,810
This is why she looks like a model.

1064
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:31,330
But there were worms too.

1065
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:34,120
Come on...

1066
01:11:34,160 --> 01:11:36,040
Organic means no insecticides
so there's worms.

1067
01:11:36,520 --> 01:11:38,160
That's how you tell it's safe to eat.

1068
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:40,280
You never studied about
Hygiene in school?

1069
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:42,680
Where's Pee Mak?

1070
01:11:45,160 --> 01:11:46,120
Uhh...

1071
01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:51,000
Well, the frontline has
made its way here.

1072
01:11:51,200 --> 01:11:52,759
It's very dangerous.

1073
01:11:52,760 --> 01:11:54,040
Mak told us to take you with us.

1074
01:11:56,720 --> 01:11:57,700
That's right.

1075
01:11:57,920 --> 01:12:01,560
How come Pee Mak didn't come with you?

1076
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:04,200
The way here is very difficult.

1077
01:12:04,240 --> 01:12:06,520
So he's gathering rations
and waiting at the waterfront.

1078
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:07,500
Yes, yes...

1079
01:12:07,740 --> 01:12:09,380
So let me get Dang for you.

1080
01:12:10,360 --> 01:12:12,399
Let's get into the boat.

1081
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:13,300
Come on Nak.

1082
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:23,280
Not too far now.
Mak should be around here.

1083
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:29,120
Puak the boat is sinking!

1084
01:12:29,480 --> 01:12:31,719
Holy shit. Too much weight.

1085
01:12:31,720 --> 01:12:32,740
What should we do?

1086
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:35,760
Just toss what we don't need.

1087
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:38,050
Come on! Toss it Shin!

1088
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:43,560
Hey! Sit still!

1089
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:45,480
What now? It's starting to sink.

1090
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:47,200
What else can we toss?

1091
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:49,760
Is Dang necessary?

1092
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:53,080
Yes. Of course.

1093
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:56,398
The paddles. Give me the paddles.

1094
01:12:56,399 --> 01:12:57,299
Huh?

1095
01:12:57,360 --> 01:12:59,400
- Hand me the paddles now!
- Here! Give them to me!

1096
01:13:01,800 --> 01:13:02,960
Is that better?

1097
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:06,550
The boat isn't sinking anymore!

1098
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:12,881
This story is ending well.

1099
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:14,520
But how do we paddle now, stupid!

1100
01:13:15,320 --> 01:13:16,940
Why did you them them away?

1101
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:21,520
They're so far now.

1102
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:23,800
Should we swim to the other side?

1103
01:13:25,360 --> 01:13:26,640
I can't swim.

1104
01:13:29,160 --> 01:13:31,120
Shit. It's Mak!

1105
01:13:36,280 --> 01:13:37,280
Pee Mak.

1106
01:13:39,880 --> 01:13:40,981
Where are you going?

1107
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:47,440
Mak. Leave us alone.

1108
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:49,240
You're dead. Just let us go.

1109
01:13:52,360 --> 01:13:53,770
What are you talking about?

1110
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:56,960
Mak died during the war,
but he doesn't know yet.

1111
01:13:57,200 --> 01:14:00,000
Yeah. Just forget about him, Nak.
You can find a new boyfriend now.

1112
01:14:05,680 --> 01:14:07,079
Am I wrong?

1113
01:14:07,080 --> 01:14:08,820
What the hell is wrong
with all of you?

1114
01:14:09,320 --> 01:14:10,558
Where are you taking my wife?

1115
01:14:10,559 --> 01:14:11,960
- Pee Mak. - Let's go.

1116
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,399
Hurry up.

1117
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:15,600
Come on.

1118
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:19,480
Pee Mak!

1119
01:14:19,800 --> 01:14:20,830
Pee Mak!

1120
01:14:21,680 --> 01:14:22,760
Pee Mak!

1121
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:24,480
Pee Mak! Pee Mak!

1122
01:14:25,280 --> 01:14:26,200
Pee Mak!

1123
01:14:27,800 --> 01:14:29,480
Pee Mak!

1124
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:31,400
Pee Mak!

1125
01:14:31,440 --> 01:14:32,600
Shit! Where is he?

1126
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:33,800
I don't know.

1127
01:14:34,280 --> 01:14:35,560
Help me! Help me!

1128
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:37,519
Pee Mak!

1129
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:38,721
Hey! Can a ghost drown?

1130
01:14:39,400 --> 01:14:41,040
Don't let him fool you.

1131
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:42,400
Pee Mak!

1132
01:14:42,440 --> 01:14:44,300
- Help me! I've got a muscle cramp!
- Pee Mak!

1133
01:14:44,340 --> 01:14:45,500
Why don't you help him?

1134
01:14:45,780 --> 01:14:46,660
Help me!

1135
01:14:46,700 --> 01:14:48,019
Ghosts can have cramps?

1136
01:14:48,120 --> 01:14:48,760
Please help him.

1137
01:14:49,080 --> 01:14:50,840
He must have taken an acting lesson.

1138
01:14:51,880 --> 01:14:53,799
Help me.

1139
01:14:53,800 --> 01:14:55,840
He's not dead. Help him!

1140
01:14:56,360 --> 01:14:57,490
Give me your hand, Mak!

1141
01:14:58,880 --> 01:14:59,960
Pee Mak!

1142
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:01,640
- Calm down.
- Are you alright?

1143
01:15:03,560 --> 01:15:05,920
What the fuck!
Why did you run away from me?

1144
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:08,399
We thought you're a ghost.

1145
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:09,720
Why did you scream

1146
01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:11,580
when we threw the holy rice at you?

1147
01:15:11,620 --> 01:15:13,870
Because it struck my wound.

1148
01:15:14,320 --> 01:15:15,960
If it were you, you would scream too!

1149
01:15:17,240 --> 01:15:19,200
Shit! We've got the
same problem again.

1150
01:15:19,400 --> 01:15:21,530
The boat's sinking.

1151
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:25,290
Dang is still necessary, right?

1152
01:15:27,800 --> 01:15:28,850
Sure he is.

1153
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:31,630
Keep paddling.

1154
01:15:31,960 --> 01:15:35,040
Come on. Faster.

1155
01:15:35,080 --> 01:15:37,280
Come on!

1156
01:15:37,480 --> 01:15:40,760
Paddle. The boat's taking on water.

1157
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:43,200
Hurry up!

1158
01:15:44,120 --> 01:15:45,160
Wait...

1159
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:47,840
Wait for what?

1160
01:15:47,880 --> 01:15:49,080
The boat is sinking.

1161
01:15:50,600 --> 01:15:52,680
At first I thought Nak was a ghost
and Mak was human.

1162
01:15:52,720 --> 01:15:54,480
But it turned out Nak's alive
and Mak's a ghost.

1163
01:15:54,520 --> 01:15:56,681
And in the end Mak isn't a
ghost after all, just human.

1164
01:15:56,720 --> 01:15:58,920
So now who is the ghost
and who is human?

1165
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:06,320
- Ter what are you grumbling about?
- Yeah...

1166
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:08,420
I was confused since the
beginning of the sentence.

1167
01:16:08,460 --> 01:16:10,920
Their names are so similar.
Mak Mak, Nak Mak.

1168
01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:12,000
See...

1169
01:16:12,760 --> 01:16:14,560
If Nak is still alive.

1170
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:17,040
And Mak is still alive.

1171
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:22,440
So whose body is it in the backyard?

1172
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:45,920
Aey...

1173
01:16:46,520 --> 01:16:47,880
Why do you have the ring?

1174
01:16:56,120 --> 01:16:57,610
Aey is a ghost!

1175
01:17:00,240 --> 01:17:03,120
Why is it when we realize something
there's always flashes of lightning?

1176
01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:05,800
Damn it. Who cares!

1177
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:07,840
Ter, kick him overboard.

1178
01:17:10,320 --> 01:17:11,798
Hey come on. Let's go.

1179
01:17:11,799 --> 01:17:13,439
- The boat's taking on water.
- Let's go.

1180
01:17:14,360 --> 01:17:15,260
Let's go.

1181
01:17:20,200 --> 01:17:23,880
Aey, I'm sorry. It wasn't me
who kicked you. It was Ter.

1182
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:27,290
Shake him off.

1183
01:17:28,440 --> 01:17:30,480
Let's go!
Come on!

1184
01:17:33,040 --> 01:17:34,620
Paddle harder. We're not moving.

1185
01:17:34,680 --> 01:17:35,840
- Faster.
- Damn it!

1186
01:17:37,080 --> 01:17:38,840
Paddling with our hands
to escape is useless.

1187
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:40,680
Here you go.

1188
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:44,438
- Thanks.
- Give it to me, I will paddle.

1189
01:17:44,439 --> 01:17:45,760
Give me the paddle. I'll do it.

1190
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:49,040
Give it your best Ter! Row.

1191
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:51,810
Ter, why did you stop?

1192
01:17:52,680 --> 01:17:54,760
Ter, why don't you keep rowing?

1193
01:17:57,600 --> 01:17:59,520
- Ter, keep rowing.
- Hey hurry.

1194
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:01,600
Aey will catch up to us.

1195
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:06,560
What is it now?

1196
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:13,260
Ter don't stand up. The
boat will flip over.

1197
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:15,090
What the hell?

1198
01:18:21,200 --> 01:18:22,760
Why are you standing, Ter?

1199
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:25,930
Mak, move.

1200
01:18:25,960 --> 01:18:27,450
What?

1201
01:18:27,480 --> 01:18:28,839
Shin, move.

1202
01:18:28,840 --> 01:18:30,080
- Me too?
- Yeah you move aside.

1203
01:18:30,280 --> 01:18:31,081
- Which way?
- Right.

1204
01:18:31,960 --> 01:18:32,460
Fine.

1205
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:34,678
- Only Puak?
- Shin you move left.

1206
01:18:34,679 --> 01:18:35,760
Left. My left or your left.

1207
01:18:36,160 --> 01:18:37,000
Just pick one!

1208
01:18:37,040 --> 01:18:38,360
- Which side?
- Any left side.

1209
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:40,890
- What left side? - The left
hand you use to wipe your ass!

1210
01:18:40,980 --> 01:18:42,040
Which way? My wound hurts.

1211
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:43,440
Mak did you move back for what!

1212
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:44,920
- Move.
- Move where?

1213
01:18:45,160 --> 01:18:46,398
- Move right.
- Okay.

1214
01:18:46,399 --> 01:18:47,559
Shin, move to the left. Left.

1215
01:18:48,680 --> 01:18:50,640
- Which way?
- Move whatever way.

1216
01:18:50,680 --> 01:18:51,738
- Which side.
- Which side?

1217
01:18:51,739 --> 01:18:52,550
What?

1218
01:18:52,580 --> 01:18:53,980
Put your head down.

1219
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:56,440
Get you head down to your feet!
Hurry! Down farther.

1220
01:18:58,000 --> 01:18:59,098
I'm sore now!

1221
01:19:02,840 --> 01:19:07,078
The drums of war sound like thunder
as we set out to protect our homeland.

1222
01:19:07,079 --> 01:19:08,539
Why are you singing now?

1223
01:19:09,960 --> 01:19:10,960
We're playing good.

1224
01:19:12,160 --> 01:19:13,718
And why am I dancing along?

1225
01:19:13,719 --> 01:19:16,759
Roused to the point of release, I
raise my white flag in sweet surrender.

1226
01:19:17,200 --> 01:19:19,120
I get a rag out and polish the sword!

1227
01:19:21,200 --> 01:19:23,160
Nak is the ghost!

1228
01:19:23,200 --> 01:19:24,260
Let's go!

1229
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:41,319
Mak, jump! Mak, come on!

1230
01:19:41,320 --> 01:19:42,320
Mak run!

1231
01:19:46,600 --> 01:19:47,680
Me too.

1232
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,370
Mak! Come on! Let's go!

1233
01:19:59,200 --> 01:20:00,180
Let's go!

1234
01:20:01,160 --> 01:20:02,520
Ter, hurry up!

1235
01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:04,499
Give me your hand. Ter! Hurry up!

1236
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:05,820
Mak hurry up!

1237
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:06,920
Mak hurry up!

1238
01:20:07,200 --> 01:20:08,360
Shin, jump now!

1239
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:10,239
Shin, jump now!

1240
01:20:10,240 --> 01:20:11,140
Shin.

1241
01:20:11,300 --> 01:20:12,101
Shin now! Just jump!

1242
01:20:13,311 --> 01:20:14,299
Shin, jump!

1243
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:15,760
I told you I can't swim.

1244
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,440
Just jump now!

1245
01:20:27,680 --> 01:20:28,320
Shin jump!

1246
01:20:28,360 --> 01:20:29,450
Now hurry up.

1247
01:20:40,120 --> 01:20:41,120
- Help me.
- Come on.

1248
01:20:42,160 --> 01:20:43,420
Didn't you say you can't swim?

1249
01:20:43,460 --> 01:20:44,918
Your stroke is like Michael Phelps!

1250
01:20:45,119 --> 01:20:45,619
Nak!

1251
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:47,440
Mak, get out of here!

1252
01:20:47,480 --> 01:20:48,338
I'm not going.

1253
01:20:48,339 --> 01:20:49,440
You're crazy! Sorry!

1254
01:20:51,440 --> 01:20:53,598
Why did you do that? It hurts!

1255
01:20:53,599 --> 01:20:54,759
How come you didn't pass out?

1256
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,300
In movies I've seen they do that
and they always pass out!

1257
01:20:57,340 --> 01:20:58,920
What the hell is wrong with you!

1258
01:20:59,800 --> 01:21:00,840
Puak!

1259
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:02,200
- Is he dead?
- I don't know.

1260
01:21:03,200 --> 01:21:06,200
Just drag him away! Run! Hurry up!

1261
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:30,800
What should we do now, father?

1262
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:39,610
Remember, no matter what happens.

1263
01:21:40,920 --> 01:21:43,490
Don't step outside the
enchanted thread.

1264
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:15,080
People aren't donating
very much nowadays.

1265
01:22:15,480 --> 01:22:17,290
We've been waiting for
months to get it fixed.

1266
01:22:17,400 --> 01:22:18,440
Father!

1267
01:22:18,680 --> 01:22:20,040
I almost shit my pants!

1268
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:28,410
Now I did!

1269
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:30,230
Father, what's next?

1270
01:22:31,120 --> 01:22:34,040
Don't worry. I'ill handle this.

1271
01:22:34,080 --> 01:22:34,999
Nak.

1272
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:36,000
Mak, don't!

1273
01:22:37,160 --> 01:22:39,160
Listen to me, baby.

1274
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:40,520
Don't listen to her!

1275
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:42,079
You're a ghost!

1276
01:22:42,080 --> 01:22:43,401
Stop the sweet talk!

1277
01:22:44,080 --> 01:22:45,800
Father, please do what you have to.

1278
01:22:46,600 --> 01:22:47,640
Ter.

1279
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:48,880
Please give me the holy water.

1280
01:22:50,440 --> 01:22:52,119
Don't hurt my wife.

1281
01:22:52,120 --> 01:22:53,600
Don't. Don't hurt my wife. Let me go!

1282
01:22:57,360 --> 01:22:59,199
Nak!

1283
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:00,510
- Do it father!
- Pee Mak!

1284
01:23:00,680 --> 01:23:03,050
Please help me!

1285
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:08,610
Let me go!

1286
01:23:14,200 --> 01:23:15,430
Fucking Ter!

1287
01:23:16,880 --> 01:23:17,958
You spilled all of it.

1288
01:23:17,959 --> 01:23:18,959
It's okay.

1289
01:23:20,480 --> 01:23:22,000
Shin, please give me the holy rice.

1290
01:23:22,600 --> 01:23:23,760
Let me go!

1291
01:23:24,160 --> 01:23:25,000
Nak!

1292
01:23:25,400 --> 01:23:26,480
Nak!

1293
01:23:26,720 --> 01:23:28,060
- Shin! - Nak!

1294
01:23:32,160 --> 01:23:33,799
Chir... chirp... chirp.

1295
01:23:33,800 --> 01:23:37,361
Hey look! So tame.
Eating from my palm.

1296
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:39,201
Why not try eating
with your feet then!

1297
01:23:40,240 --> 01:23:43,559
- This isn't the time to get an
animal lover on us. - That's okay.

1298
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:46,250
As long as we stay inside this
holy thread, we'll be safe!

1299
01:23:49,640 --> 01:23:50,660
Father!

1300
01:24:00,760 --> 01:24:02,398
What the hell! Whose hand is it?

1301
01:24:02,399 --> 01:24:03,579
Shit! Which way to go?

1302
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:05,960
Is that you Shin?

1303
01:24:10,360 --> 01:24:13,160
What's up with this?

1304
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:15,530
It's time for me to go.

1305
01:24:19,480 --> 01:24:22,410
The monk already
made it over the wall.

1306
01:24:31,200 --> 01:24:32,960
Turn the other way.
I'm getting cramps.

1307
01:24:33,400 --> 01:24:34,840
- Hurry.
- Nak.

1308
01:24:35,920 --> 01:24:37,070
Pee Mak!

1309
01:24:37,271 --> 01:24:37,999
Nak!

1310
01:24:38,011 --> 01:24:38,720
Pee Mak!

1311
01:24:38,760 --> 01:24:39,640
Nak!

1312
01:24:39,680 --> 01:24:40,640
Pee Mak!

1313
01:24:40,680 --> 01:24:41,519
Nak!

1314
01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:42,520
Pee Mak!

1315
01:24:42,920 --> 01:24:44,001
That's enough!

1316
01:24:44,480 --> 01:24:46,140
This isn't a name calling game.

1317
01:24:47,400 --> 01:24:50,400
Let's go that way.

1318
01:24:53,640 --> 01:24:54,720
Aey!

1319
01:25:08,600 --> 01:25:11,879
Aey, please let us go!
We used to be friends.

1320
01:25:11,880 --> 01:25:13,400
You know I didn't do anything to you.

1321
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:18,540
Ter! You're the one who kicked him
off the boat. I told you not to!

1322
01:25:19,080 --> 01:25:20,120
I'm not a ghost.

1323
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:22,760
I don't believe you.
Don't come any closer.

1324
01:25:24,440 --> 01:25:25,959
Don't push!

1325
01:25:25,960 --> 01:25:26,859
Nak!

1326
01:25:26,860 --> 01:25:28,300
What should we do now, Ter?

1327
01:25:29,200 --> 01:25:30,840
Puak, you are still wet right?

1328
01:25:31,680 --> 01:25:33,839
Of course. Why?

1329
01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:34,740
Shin! Mak!

1330
01:25:35,160 --> 01:25:37,440
I'll count to 3 and push
Puak towards Aey.

1331
01:25:38,860 --> 01:25:40,100
- 1. - Can we talk
about it first?

1332
01:25:40,140 --> 01:25:41,060
- 2.
- Shit!

1333
01:25:41,100 --> 01:25:41,919
3!

1334
01:25:41,920 --> 01:25:43,020
I hate all of you.

1335
01:25:49,600 --> 01:25:51,320
- Everyone jump him.
- Jump for what!

1336
01:25:54,200 --> 01:25:57,080
See? If you're human why'd you scream
when the holy water touched you?

1337
01:25:57,560 --> 01:25:59,880
I screamed because you guys
are on top of me and it hurts!

1338
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:02,120
Disgusting!

1339
01:26:03,760 --> 01:26:04,680
Get up! Get up!

1340
01:26:04,720 --> 01:26:05,640
Get up!

1341
01:26:07,600 --> 01:26:10,438
So why does the holy water
not hurt you like Nak?

1342
01:26:10,439 --> 01:26:11,560
I told you I'm not a ghost.

1343
01:26:11,960 --> 01:26:13,370
How come you've got the ring?

1344
01:26:14,960 --> 01:26:16,040
Well...

1345
01:26:17,520 --> 01:26:18,710
I needed some money.

1346
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:22,358
I saw it with my own eyes.
The ruby ring is exactly like Nak's.

1347
01:26:22,359 --> 01:26:23,599
Is the Ruby big?

1348
01:26:38,120 --> 01:26:39,240
Where's Aey?

1349
01:26:40,280 --> 01:26:41,560
Where have you been, Aey?

1350
01:26:41,600 --> 01:26:43,410
I had diarrhea.

1351
01:26:44,200 --> 01:26:45,280
I'm sorry,

1352
01:26:45,680 --> 01:26:46,910
I needed the money to gamble.

1353
01:26:52,440 --> 01:26:54,320
I had you all wrong. I'm sorry.

1354
01:26:56,280 --> 01:26:57,720
I thought you were a ghost.

1355
01:26:58,160 --> 01:26:59,080
But really...

1356
01:26:59,520 --> 01:27:00,440
betting...

1357
01:27:02,120 --> 01:27:03,400
and you watching too many movies

1358
01:27:03,440 --> 01:27:05,360
and always making presumptions.

1359
01:27:05,960 --> 01:27:07,520
Aren't you guys forgetting something?

1360
01:27:09,080 --> 01:27:10,060
What?

1361
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,960
That Nak is still standing here?

1362
01:27:26,200 --> 01:27:27,360
Nak!

1363
01:27:27,400 --> 01:27:30,760
Mak! Let's go! Run!

1364
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:35,450
It's stuck!

1365
01:27:39,400 --> 01:27:40,320
This one's stuck too!

1366
01:27:41,440 --> 01:27:42,880
Nak!

1367
01:27:42,920 --> 01:27:44,358
Please just let us go!

1368
01:27:44,359 --> 01:27:46,039
You're a ghost, so stay
in your own world.

1369
01:27:46,400 --> 01:27:47,680
You can't be with the living.

1370
01:27:48,040 --> 01:27:50,639
It's unnatural. It's sacrilegious.

1371
01:27:50,640 --> 01:27:52,380
It won't work out. It's not okay.

1372
01:27:53,200 --> 01:27:54,430
Don't you understand?

1373
01:27:58,000 --> 01:27:59,440
Don't mess with me!

1374
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:06,170
What happened?

1375
01:28:14,800 --> 01:28:16,360
Nak disappeared!

1376
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:35,640
It's stuck too!

1377
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:39,560
What are we going to do?

1378
01:28:47,160 --> 01:28:49,698
If I make it out of this.
I'll donate lots of money...

1379
01:28:49,999 --> 01:28:51,179
to fix this damned roof!

1380
01:28:52,760 --> 01:28:53,960
Puak,

1381
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:55,800
it's not the roof.

1382
01:29:13,200 --> 01:29:14,240
Mak, run!

1383
01:29:16,760 --> 01:29:17,680
Nak!

1384
01:29:17,840 --> 01:29:20,240
Please don't hurt us!
I'm really scared.

1385
01:29:20,720 --> 01:29:23,438
Even in your normal form I'm
already scared shitless.

1386
01:29:23,439 --> 01:29:25,240
Now with your head upside down
like Spiderman.

1387
01:29:26,640 --> 01:29:28,760
Why do you keep getting
between Pee Mak and me?

1388
01:29:29,520 --> 01:29:30,758
What have I ever done to you?

1389
01:29:30,759 --> 01:29:31,959
Because you are an evil ghost!

1390
01:29:32,320 --> 01:29:33,550
Why did you kill Aunty Priek?

1391
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:34,800
I didn't kill her.

1392
01:29:35,240 --> 01:29:37,480
She was drunk, fell in
the water and drowned.

1393
01:29:37,620 --> 01:29:38,559
I don't believe it!

1394
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:40,800
You're a beautiful big fat liar!

1395
01:29:40,840 --> 01:29:42,840
I told you. I didn't kill her.

1396
01:29:47,720 --> 01:29:49,360
Let's go!

1397
01:29:51,120 --> 01:29:53,170
I just wanted to be
with the person I love.

1398
01:29:53,900 --> 01:29:55,440
Why do you guys have to be in the way?

1399
01:29:55,680 --> 01:29:58,758
That isn't called love!
It's called selfishness!

1400
01:29:59,059 --> 01:30:01,039
Right! Mak can't go anywhere anymore.

1401
01:30:01,480 --> 01:30:03,160
The villagers are all scared of him.

1402
01:30:03,520 --> 01:30:04,520
I'm scared too.

1403
01:30:04,560 --> 01:30:06,638
Why don't you go
where you're supposed to go?

1404
01:30:06,639 --> 01:30:09,059
Just like Mak's Aunty!
She didn't come back!

1405
01:30:10,200 --> 01:30:11,280
Neither did Aunty Priek!

1406
01:30:11,320 --> 01:30:13,918
They've probably been reincarnated
and got married already!

1407
01:30:13,919 --> 01:30:15,559
You died already!
How can you be with Mak?

1408
01:30:27,800 --> 01:30:30,270
If I can't be with Mak in this world,

1409
01:30:32,080 --> 01:30:34,080
then Pee Mak must go with me.

1410
01:30:41,800 --> 01:30:44,090
What the hell are you standing there for?

1411
01:30:48,800 --> 01:30:49,930
Mak!

1412
01:31:51,570 --> 01:31:53,170
Are you that scared of me?

1413
01:32:01,640 --> 01:32:03,280
I'm sorry.

1414
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:08,400
If I ever hurt you,

1415
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:13,160
I wouldn't be able
to live with myself.

1416
01:32:22,280 --> 01:32:23,960
Don't cry baby.

1417
01:32:26,280 --> 01:32:27,480
You won't look handsome.

1418
01:32:33,760 --> 01:32:34,990
I'm sorry...

1419
01:32:36,960 --> 01:32:38,560
for lying to you all this time.

1420
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:48,080
I just wanted to be with you
as long as I could.

1421
01:32:51,720 --> 01:32:54,490
Even if it's just for one more day.

1422
01:33:06,400 --> 01:33:10,000
Do you still remember what
we spoke about on the ferris wheel?

1423
01:33:12,480 --> 01:33:13,890
I'm sorry...

1424
01:33:16,280 --> 01:33:19,250
you can't get to die before me.

1425
01:33:41,160 --> 01:33:42,920
Please promise me.

1426
01:33:46,040 --> 01:33:48,800
When I'm gone.

1427
01:33:49,600 --> 01:33:51,650
You'll have to carry on.

1428
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:06,230
Nak...

1429
01:34:07,600 --> 01:34:09,160
you don't have to go anywhere.

1430
01:34:10,240 --> 01:34:11,800
You said you lied to me.

1431
01:34:12,800 --> 01:34:14,640
You didn't lie to me at all.

1432
01:34:17,880 --> 01:34:19,210
Even though I'm a fool,

1433
01:34:21,480 --> 01:34:25,120
I'm not so stupid that
I wouldn't know that my wife was dead.

1434
01:34:33,360 --> 01:34:35,490
I'll go send off your friends.

1435
01:35:12,520 --> 01:35:13,930
Nak...

1436
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:22,880
Nak...

1437
01:35:24,200 --> 01:35:25,690
Nak!

1438
01:35:28,400 --> 01:35:29,520
Where did you go

1439
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,650
to get this dirty?

1440
01:35:33,320 --> 01:35:35,850
Let's see what my darling
prepared for me to eat.

1441
01:35:47,640 --> 01:35:50,320
Your cooking's as good as always.

1442
01:35:53,160 --> 01:35:54,960
Nak you're so pretty,

1443
01:35:55,560 --> 01:35:56,720
how could you be a ghost?

1444
01:35:57,560 --> 01:35:58,460
Right?

1445
01:36:08,480 --> 01:36:11,400
I realized it since we
were playing charades.

1446
01:36:15,320 --> 01:36:16,960
Even if all the villagers avoid me

1447
01:36:18,400 --> 01:36:19,761
and nobody wanted to be my friend.

1448
01:36:21,280 --> 01:36:23,200
And even if I have to eat
dried leaves everyday.

1449
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,160
I would still want to be with you.

1450
01:36:37,840 --> 01:36:39,360
Thank you,

1451
01:36:42,040 --> 01:36:43,840
but it's impossible.

1452
01:36:44,400 --> 01:36:45,500
Why not?

1453
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:49,240
We can't just pretend
that nothing's changed.

1454
01:36:50,520 --> 01:36:53,170
All this time we did fine together,

1455
01:36:53,200 --> 01:36:54,560
but I'm dead.

1456
01:36:58,240 --> 01:36:59,470
The living and the dead

1457
01:37:01,160 --> 01:37:04,000
can't stay together. It's not natural.

1458
01:37:05,760 --> 01:37:06,780
If that's so,

1459
01:37:08,320 --> 01:37:10,200
then my love for you is
just a freak of nature.

1460
01:37:12,700 --> 01:37:13,538
When I was at war.

1461
01:37:14,039 --> 01:37:15,920
Do you have any last words?

1462
01:37:16,680 --> 01:37:18,090
I should've died that day.

1463
01:37:18,840 --> 01:37:20,290
No one thought I'd make it,

1464
01:37:29,880 --> 01:37:31,480
but I found my way back to you.

1465
01:37:47,720 --> 01:37:48,840
Help!

1466
01:37:49,760 --> 01:37:50,840
Help!

1467
01:37:55,680 --> 01:37:56,760
Help!

1468
01:37:57,560 --> 01:37:58,600
Help!

1469
01:38:00,720 --> 01:38:01,880
Pee Mak.

1470
01:38:18,960 --> 01:38:20,800
Even you died already,

1471
01:38:23,720 --> 01:38:25,650
but were still able
to come back for me.

1472
01:38:32,800 --> 01:38:34,840
You also used your powers
to help me hit those cans.

1473
01:38:35,080 --> 01:38:37,650
So we could bring a
doll back for Dang.

1474
01:38:41,160 --> 01:38:42,320
How is it wrong

1475
01:38:42,920 --> 01:38:44,440
that we can love each other this much?

1476
01:38:48,720 --> 01:38:50,800
Aren't you scared of me?

1477
01:38:53,200 --> 01:38:56,160
You know I'm scared of ghosts,

1478
01:38:58,800 --> 01:39:01,320
but I'm scared more of
living without you.

1479
01:39:11,240 --> 01:39:12,720
Just one thing though,

1480
01:39:13,800 --> 01:39:15,220
don't ever hang upside down

1481
01:39:16,080 --> 01:39:17,120
like that again.

1482
01:39:18,160 --> 01:39:19,570
I almost had a heart attack.

1483
01:39:30,600 --> 01:39:32,040
Damn...

1484
01:39:32,840 --> 01:39:34,240
I'm really moved.

1485
01:39:39,440 --> 01:39:41,040
I promise you,

1486
01:39:42,320 --> 01:39:43,810
no matter what happens,

1487
01:39:45,320 --> 01:39:47,399
we'll be friends forever!

1488
01:39:47,400 --> 01:39:48,310
Yeah!

1489
01:39:49,040 --> 01:39:50,530
If you die and become ghosts,

1490
01:39:51,480 --> 01:39:52,440
I won't be afraid.

1491
01:39:53,600 --> 01:39:55,920
But I remember you kicked me off the boat.

1492
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:57,680
Come on,

1493
01:39:58,440 --> 01:40:00,050
we all love each other.

1494
01:40:28,600 --> 01:40:30,079
Nak...

1495
01:40:30,080 --> 01:40:31,190
Nak, do you love me?

1496
01:40:32,620 --> 01:40:33,900
I love you.

1497
01:40:34,880 --> 01:40:35,720
Do you love me a lot?

1498
01:40:36,720 --> 01:40:38,880
Nak loves Pee Mak lots and lots.

1499
01:40:40,480 --> 01:40:41,820
I love you Nak.

1500
01:40:42,360 --> 01:40:43,870
Too much.

1501
01:41:08,800 --> 01:41:10,290
Nak.

1502
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:12,960
Nak.

1503
01:41:19,251 --> 01:41:23,680
I wish I could freeze this moment

1504
01:41:23,820 --> 01:41:31,220
forever before we must part.

1505
01:41:42,960 --> 01:41:44,240
Baby. I love you.

1506
01:41:44,920 --> 01:41:52,200
Give me your hand
to hold and to keep in my heart warm.

1507
01:41:52,240 --> 01:41:59,680
Let me look in your eyes,

1508
01:41:59,720 --> 01:42:03,319
so I'll never be lonely.

1509
01:42:03,320 --> 01:42:04,800
This shelter shouldn't leak anymore.

1510
01:42:05,200 --> 01:42:06,160
Ask us for help anytime!

1511
01:42:08,200 --> 01:42:09,720
Come on, dear!

1512
01:42:09,760 --> 01:42:10,880
Mind your hands.

1513
01:42:11,960 --> 01:42:12,800
What?

1514
01:42:13,480 --> 01:42:14,279
Horn?

1515
01:42:14,280 --> 01:42:14,999
Hair?

1516
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:15,799
You? She?

1517
01:42:15,800 --> 01:42:16,560
It's head for sure!

1518
01:42:17,520 --> 01:42:18,081
Is that right?

1519
01:42:18,480 --> 01:42:19,120
It's got a head!

1520
01:42:19,600 --> 01:42:20,100
Melon head.

1521
01:42:20,840 --> 01:42:21,720
Exploded head.

1522
01:42:21,760 --> 01:42:22,600
Potato head.

1523
01:42:22,640 --> 01:42:23,560
What kind of head?

1524
01:42:24,720 --> 01:42:25,640
No head!

1525
01:42:25,840 --> 01:42:26,840
Headless!

1526
01:42:26,880 --> 01:42:28,800
Headless!
Mak is correct!

1527
01:42:28,840 --> 01:42:29,800
Yay!

1528
01:42:30,320 --> 01:42:32,350
I got it right! The first
time ever in my life.

1529
01:42:32,580 --> 01:42:33,560
Shin!

1530
01:42:34,040 --> 01:42:35,490
Aren't you happy for me?

1531
01:42:38,800 --> 01:42:41,010
The haunted house is even spookier!

1532
01:42:44,880 --> 01:42:49,440
Come on, let's play!

1533
01:42:58,240 --> 01:43:00,520
How do they do it?
It's so realistic!

1534
01:43:00,560 --> 01:43:01,480
Exactly!

1535
01:43:02,840 --> 01:43:03,920
Thanks.

1536
01:43:07,440 --> 01:43:09,240
Come on!

1537
01:43:12,480 --> 01:43:13,690
I'll show you myself!

1538
01:43:15,760 --> 01:43:17,978
You throw like a blind man.
You'll never hit anything!

1539
01:43:18,279 --> 01:43:19,639
This time, don't help me, okay?

1540
01:43:32,560 --> 01:43:33,560
Brothers and sisters!

1541
01:43:34,320 --> 01:43:36,280
Mak has gone too far!

1542
01:43:36,320 --> 01:43:37,440
Agree!

1543
01:43:37,480 --> 01:43:41,000
We can't have this unnatural
thing going on any longer!

1544
01:43:41,040 --> 01:43:42,600
Yes! We won't!

1545
01:43:42,640 --> 01:43:43,800
Enough!

1546
01:43:43,920 --> 01:43:46,360
We'll get rid of them tonight!

1547
01:43:46,720 --> 01:43:48,130
Who's coming with me?

1548
01:43:48,160 --> 01:43:49,300
Coming!

1549
01:43:49,560 --> 01:43:51,570
I'm coming too!

1550
01:43:58,720 --> 01:43:59,780
Shit!

1551
01:44:01,600 --> 01:44:03,290
Hurry Uncle or you'll be late!
