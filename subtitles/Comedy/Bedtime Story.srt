00:00:43,808 --> 00:00:48,848
Stories for Good night

2
00:02:07,408 --> 00:02:11,808
Nekoæ long ago in a castle near
mora zivio je naoèit princ.

3
00:02:11,848 --> 00:02:17,168
Well is not this just a castle,
bio je to chateau na Francuskoj rivijeri.

4
00:02:17,208 --> 00:02:20,968
And he's not really a prince,
makar su Ijudi to mislili,

5
00:02:21,003 --> 00:02:23,133
pogotovo njegove zrtve.

6
00:02:23,168 --> 00:02:29,408
Please, Your Excellency, please accept this small contribution
your large order.

7
00:02:29,448 --> 00:02:32,888
At least make these emeralds
brought freedom many of my people,

8
00:02:32,923 --> 00:02:34,888
can not accept them.

9
00:02:34,928 --> 00:02:37,888
But I beg you!
Imagine what you can buy them!

10
00:02:37,923 --> 00:02:39,888
No ma'am!

11
00:02:39,928 --> 00:02:42,768
The lives of men and women and small children.

12
00:02:43,168 --> 00:02:48,168
Men and women of my country would die to know that their
Prince accepts alms.

13
00:02:48,203 --> 00:02:53,973
But for small children...
You have forever bound.

14
00:02:54,008 --> 00:02:58,208
Oh no, Your Grace,
do not know what a pleasure for me, usually puèanku

15
00:02:58,488 --> 00:03:01,608
,
be this close to a prince.

16
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:05,093
Stand up lady, you're not puèanka.

17
00:03:05,128 --> 00:03:08,728
This humane act you become a noblewoman.

18
00:03:08,768 --> 00:03:10,808
What a miracle!

19
00:03:10,843 --> 00:03:12,128
What?

20
00:03:12,168 --> 00:03:16,728
Jewelry is usually reinforce the beauty of women,
but in your case is vice versa.

21
00:03:16,768 --> 00:03:19,528
You're actually better without your necklaces.

22
00:03:19,568 --> 00:03:20,933
Really?

23
00:03:20,968 --> 00:03:25,608
Yes. Artificial beauty necklaces
reduce your natural beauty.

24
00:03:25,648 --> 00:03:28,768
Incredible!

25
00:03:28,808 --> 00:03:32,648
Simply the fantastic!

26
00:03:32,688 --> 00:03:40,128
lady, I beg you, stop.
For your own safety.

27
00:03:42,168 --> 00:03:45,728
Although the his victims
odricale neprocjenjivih blaga

28
00:03:45,768 --> 00:03:50,248
they were all sure that this is a small
cijena za tako veliku pustolovinu.

29
00:03:50,448 --> 00:03:55,728
Meanwhile, in the woods around a small tag
njemaèkog sela nalazio se jedan vuk.

30
00:03:55,768 --> 00:03:59,568
Obilazio je sela u potrazi za zrtvama.

31
00:03:59,603 --> 00:04:03,368
Kao i princ, i on je vrebao samo zene.

32
00:04:58,768 --> 00:05:02,668
Guden. Bitte, help me die?

33
00:05:02,703 --> 00:05:06,533
I speak English, vodnièe.

34
00:05:06,568 --> 00:05:14,088
Excellent! Germany's slowly coming back to me.
For a long time I did with my grandmother prièao.

35
00:05:14,128 --> 00:05:16,293
Your grandmother is German?

36
00:05:16,328 --> 00:05:21,248
Of course,was born just in this country.
Actually, that's why I am here.

37
00:05:21,288 --> 00:05:24,888
I promised her that I will
find her birth house.

38
00:05:24,928 --> 00:05:27,648
It gave me this old photo.

39
00:05:35,768 --> 00:05:39,088
This is the house!

40
00:05:39,128 --> 00:05:41,968
Oh no!

41
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:45,528
Come! Look!

42
00:05:46,528 --> 00:05:49,128
See.

43
00:05:55,328 --> 00:05:58,248
Come! I'll show you inside.

44
00:05:58,288 --> 00:06:01,368
Do not! You do not want to annoy their parents.

45
00:06:01,403 --> 00:06:03,808
And no, I live here alone.

46
00:06:08,728 --> 00:06:10,888
Incredible!

47
00:06:11,328 --> 00:06:17,608
As I was already there.
It is the same as my grandmother described.

48
00:06:17,648 --> 00:06:23,008
Look!
There is a fireplace and wooden beams grandparents...

49
00:06:23,048 --> 00:06:28,928
and painted windows and a gold medallion that you wear.

50
00:06:28,968 --> 00:06:34,688
My grandmother had the same kind.
She lost her.

51
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:40,408
But I told her that she'll try to find the same
such.

52
00:06:40,448 --> 00:06:45,568
Ah, those stairs!
How many times I prièala on those stairs...

53
00:06:45,603 --> 00:06:49,088
take you straight to the bedroom, right?
- That's right!

54
00:06:49,128 --> 00:06:54,388
Prièala me on his bed and mattress stuffed with feathers
who

55
00:06:54,423 --> 00:06:59,648
was so soft that just drifted into it.
How it was that called?

56
00:06:59,688 --> 00:07:02,328
Ein feder bet!
- That's right! Ein Bet spring.

57
00:07:02,688 --> 00:07:06,253
One is now up.
- And no, nothing can be so soft.

58
00:07:06,288 --> 00:07:10,248
Come up and see.
- really you are sitting there with him as she said?

59
00:07:10,288 --> 00:07:14,368
Can I be convinced.

60
00:07:14,608 --> 00:07:20,128
Oh, what stories do I have to grandma
when I get back home.

61
00:07:51,768 --> 00:07:57,448
Monsier Jameson! Redhead in gold dress, Fanny

62
00:07:57,488 --> 00:08:00,288
Eubank, widow, Omaha,

63
00:08:00,328 --> 00:08:06,408
36,
$ 24 million, 35 carat necklace.

64
00:08:06,448 --> 00:08:10,888
36/24/35. Perfect measure.

65
00:08:51,248 --> 00:08:56,208
Grosse Mutter, if my luck you'll
monitor its operation.

66
00:09:07,568 --> 00:09:12,608
This is your biggame? - It is the king.

67
00:09:12,688 --> 00:09:15,768
Dude, we have officers who
better looking than him.

68
00:09:15,808 --> 00:09:18,608
All I know is that it always succeeds.

69
00:09:18,648 --> 00:09:22,168
If she was blonde girl goal, will not make it tonight

70
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:26,088
because she and the mayor's daughter
inaccessible to all soldiers.

71
00:09:26,128 --> 00:09:30,128
Can Bet? Wages for a month?

72
00:09:30,163 --> 00:09:32,808
Can.

73
00:09:38,648 --> 00:09:44,688
Sorry, you can ask him to lend me a couple
marks on my badges.

74
00:09:52,888 --> 00:09:57,088
Excuse me, can not say that.

75
00:10:04,848 --> 00:10:07,528
Oh, that beautiful medallion!

76
00:10:07,568 --> 00:10:12,288
It was from my grandmother.
She wanted to give him buduæoj woman.

77
00:10:12,328 --> 00:10:15,408
But, if you ask...

78
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:20,528
Oh no, I can not allow
to sell. Here, let me.

79
00:10:20,563 --> 00:10:23,408
Ah, I can not accept money from women.

80
00:10:23,448 --> 00:10:26,968
But it is for the operation of your grandmother!

81
00:10:27,008 --> 00:10:30,288
Ooops!
Thanks anyway, but I really can not.

82
00:10:30,323 --> 00:10:32,773
It was old and had a good life.

83
00:10:32,808 --> 00:10:38,168
The only regret that it is not the last days
lived here in his native country.

84
00:10:38,203 --> 00:10:43,768
Your grandmother is German?
- She was born just in this city.

85
00:10:43,803 --> 00:10:49,368
I try to find this house.
Here's an old photo.

86
00:10:49,688 --> 00:10:55,368
This is the house where I live! - No!

87
00:11:11,048 --> 00:11:16,968
Can you see what I get for this?
- No royal ring, Your Highness!

88
00:11:17,008 --> 00:11:24,088
You fool! I told you not call me that!
Are you my life means nothing?

89
00:11:27,768 --> 00:11:31,688
Excuse me, is this really the man
royal family?

90
00:11:31,723 --> 00:11:35,208
No ma'am!
- But I heard him calling Grace.

91
00:11:35,248 --> 00:11:40,168
Please remember this.
- Believe me, I will not tell anyone.

92
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:47,288
lady, I have already causedPrince...
- It is the royal family. And this prince!

93
00:11:47,323 --> 00:11:51,328
Zvuèao as it is in trouble.
Maybe I can help if you know me.

94
00:11:51,368 --> 00:11:56,808
If you really want to help,
Remember all that heard and saw.

95
00:11:56,848 --> 00:12:01,168
Forget that there was this prince,

96
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:05,408
the outstanding man of the terrible fate.

97
00:12:13,888 --> 00:12:19,168
Your Highness!
Do not be nervous, you can trust me.

98
00:12:19,203 --> 00:12:21,173
You are my minions?

99
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:24,808
No, I'm American.
Patty Eubank from Omaha.

100
00:12:24,848 --> 00:12:29,568
I Naèula.
If you have problems and if you can help at all.

101
00:12:29,608 --> 00:12:34,968
Thank you, dear lady. I rarely saw suosjeæanje
Beauty and the same woman,

102
00:12:35,008 --> 00:12:39,448
but I can not accept.
you have already risked much just prièajuæi with me.

103
00:12:39,488 --> 00:12:43,853
I have mighty enemies.
- I still want to help.

104
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:48,688
Truly you are an exceptional woman!
Beauty, suosjeæanje and now - courage!

105
00:12:48,723 --> 00:12:51,328
Can not think of three women in history
with these qualities:

106
00:12:51,368 --> 00:12:55,288
Helen of Troy,
Joan of Arc and Elizabeth of England.

107
00:12:55,328 --> 00:13:01,648
But now there is the fourth...
Fanny of Omaha.

108
00:13:08,408 --> 00:13:11,968
Fanny of Omaha!

109
00:13:16,408 --> 00:13:19,533
Please tell me where you live!

110
00:13:19,568 --> 00:13:24,528
lady, already know too much
thanks to my stupidity.

111
00:13:24,563 --> 00:13:29,488
Do not blame yourself.
It is written in the stars.

112
00:13:29,528 --> 00:13:33,768
In my horoscope said that I will meet today
very special person.

113
00:13:33,808 --> 00:13:39,728
Still I feel guilty.
- Do not, everything is written in the stars.

114
00:13:39,763 --> 00:13:45,008
Who am I to fight
with such mighty forces?

115
00:13:45,048 --> 00:13:51,048
I must warn you that
there is a certain danger.

116
00:13:51,088 --> 00:13:54,413
Is said to have mighty enemies.

117
00:13:54,448 --> 00:14:01,848
I thought the emotional risk.
lonely prince and a beautiful woman

118
00:14:01,888 --> 00:14:06,128
are a dangerous combination.

119
00:14:06,168 --> 00:14:10,728
Prince is alone?
- Yes, the widower is already five years

120
00:14:10,763 --> 00:14:18,093
and so devoted to
to raise money to free his country

121
00:14:18,128 --> 00:14:25,408
you are denied even the emotional comfort
Women's Society.

122
00:14:25,448 --> 00:14:28,448
Five years?

123
00:14:38,328 --> 00:14:39,648
Come in.!

124
00:14:40,368 --> 00:14:45,528
Come in.! Surely you want to tell his grandmother
that you saw inside the house.

125
00:14:45,563 --> 00:14:49,528
I would like, but since you no
parent, I think I should not.

126
00:14:49,568 --> 00:14:52,528
You uopæe like other U.S. soldiers.

127
00:14:52,568 --> 00:14:56,408
Yes, everyone made fun of me because of it.

128
00:14:56,443 --> 00:14:59,208
UDI, just for a minute.

129
00:14:59,248 --> 00:15:02,328
I should not. Not until you no father.

130
00:15:02,368 --> 00:15:07,528
Maybe you're right.
Come tomorrow, Dad will be home.

131
00:15:07,568 --> 00:15:15,088
Right. Thank you. Good night.

132
00:15:15,123 --> 00:15:16,808
What is it?

133
00:15:16,848 --> 00:15:20,448
Nothing, I just did not eaten all day.

134
00:15:20,488 --> 00:15:25,408
I am saving money to be able to gamble
Grandma's operation.

135
00:15:25,448 --> 00:15:33,488
Not leaving out of this house until you get the right domaæu
dinner and all that goes with it.

136
00:15:33,523 --> 00:15:35,808
And your dad?

137
00:15:35,848 --> 00:15:39,888
If there is a dad, he would have done the same thing I
and I do.

138
00:15:39,928 --> 00:15:42,008
Well I doubt it really.

139
00:15:47,768 --> 00:15:52,808
Give pay. Inside were already two hours.
Tonight will not overflow.

140
00:15:52,848 --> 00:15:58,128
it will overflow. No one in uniform may not end up with
gradonaèelnikovom daughters.

141
00:15:58,168 --> 00:16:00,848
If a uniform matter
Freddy will overflow out of it.

142
00:16:00,888 --> 00:16:05,208
How? I do not know, but it will do.

143
00:16:08,808 --> 00:16:12,608
Grandma was right about
German girls.

144
00:16:12,643 --> 00:16:14,608
What did she say?

145
00:16:14,648 --> 00:16:19,528
Often used to say, although I never exactly knew
What it means:

146
00:16:26,328 --> 00:16:28,328
Can wetranslate?

147
00:16:28,368 --> 00:16:30,728
Well, I can convey the basic idea.

148
00:16:30,768 --> 00:16:33,968
No, I would like to know the words to words.

149
00:16:34,008 --> 00:16:40,048
Well, it means that Germany
knows the girl met a man in every way.

150
00:16:40,088 --> 00:16:42,128
In every way?

151
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:48,568
A man would probably need to know
marry if it was true.

152
00:16:48,608 --> 00:16:51,408
This is something I can do.

153
00:16:51,443 --> 00:16:54,173
Already you're married?

154
00:16:54,208 --> 00:16:58,728
No, I am a U.S. soldier, and you
Mayor's daughter and inaccessible to me.

155
00:16:58,763 --> 00:17:02,968
Why? Because I wear this uniform.

156
00:17:03,008 --> 00:17:08,328
Has it makes it fair?
- I. - No, no.

157
00:17:08,368 --> 00:17:13,448
Why would a piece of cloth man emotions dictate
? It is inhuman.

158
00:17:13,488 --> 00:17:18,568
This is a uniform wall among us.
Suddenly I hate her.

159
00:17:18,608 --> 00:17:22,208
Not allowed to say it.
- It is true. I hate it.

160
00:17:22,248 --> 00:17:28,768
It is the hard wall that separates us.
Trapped alone in this shirt.

161
00:17:28,808 --> 00:17:34,888
It is a symbol of tyranny.
I reject it.

162
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:40,808
Nek'mi judge, let me shoot.
I do not care for the army. For the Pentagon.

163
00:17:40,848 --> 00:17:43,693
To Congress. For the president.

164
00:17:43,728 --> 00:17:47,768
I will not allow them to me as a man
restrict rights.

165
00:17:58,968 --> 00:18:03,168
Finally I'm free, free
to be his.

166
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:09,848
No U.S. soldier, but German
German boy in love with a girl.

167
00:18:09,883 --> 00:18:13,093
Dad! - Anna!

168
00:18:13,128 --> 00:18:17,968
Good evening, sir.
You must be wondering what I'm doing here.

169
00:18:18,003 --> 00:18:22,448
Tonight starts a new NATO exercise program, and

170
00:18:22,488 --> 00:18:24,768
I was assigned to this block.

171
00:18:24,808 --> 00:18:29,808
All together now!
One, two, three, four...

172
00:18:41,848 --> 00:18:46,613
I'm so relaxed, so happy.

173
00:18:46,648 --> 00:18:49,453
you will remember his vow of silence?

174
00:18:49,488 --> 00:18:53,408
Oh yeah,Your Highness, I will be blind
Keep your instructions.

175
00:18:53,448 --> 00:18:59,528
Right. - Your Highness?
- Yes? - Say one more time.

176
00:18:59,568 --> 00:19:02,208
Fanny of Omaha!

177
00:19:05,648 --> 00:19:07,773
absent without permission, in a raid

178
00:19:07,808 --> 00:19:11,808
gradonaèelnikov home under false pretenses.

179
00:19:11,848 --> 00:19:17,328
caught without uniforms, half naked,
attempted seduction the mayor's daughter.

180
00:19:17,363 --> 00:19:20,328
Private, these charges are outrageous!

181
00:19:20,368 --> 00:19:24,448
Yes, colonel, you are in big trouble.
- I in trouble?

182
00:19:24,488 --> 00:19:28,128
I want to become general, and
would not look good in your record

183
00:19:28,163 --> 00:19:30,653
you can not control their troops.

184
00:19:30,688 --> 00:19:33,408
Who says you can not
to control your troops?

185
00:19:33,448 --> 00:19:37,728
Just look at that infractions
the event, on this basis, under your nose.

186
00:19:37,768 --> 00:19:39,533
Which offenses?

187
00:19:39,568 --> 00:19:47,088
Gambling, introducing girls
Sneaking cigarettes, there is still room for and even whiskey.

188
00:19:47,128 --> 00:19:52,128
Do not mention the porn movies
displayed in the toilet every evening.

189
00:19:52,168 --> 00:19:55,373
Sir, your base is a hotbed of corruption.

190
00:19:55,408 --> 00:20:00,168
I want to see those responsible for these offenses
Here Now!

191
00:20:00,203 --> 00:20:03,128
Here I am, sir.
- Only you?

192
00:20:03,168 --> 00:20:07,728
A sergeant usually so
a real fool of her colonel...

193
00:20:07,768 --> 00:20:09,648
I doubt that you will become a general.

194
00:20:09,688 --> 00:20:12,853
Is it me you're trying to blackmail
their own dossier?

195
00:20:12,888 --> 00:20:17,368
Blackmailing is such an ugly word.
Do not say we could convince?

196
00:20:17,403 --> 00:20:23,385
What a man can take so
shabby trick to get the girl...

197
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:29,368
The house where your grandmother ro?ena!
Vodnièe. you...

198
00:20:32,488 --> 00:20:36,053
Yes! - Dad, I just wanted to know
When you gonna comehome.

199
00:20:36,088 --> 00:20:40,928
I do not know dear, it all depends on what we decide to do with
sergeant Benson!

200
00:20:40,968 --> 00:20:47,968
Freddie Benson? You know that the house which is rented
ro?ena his grandmother?

201
00:20:57,408 --> 00:21:02,648
You and my daughter? - Yes, Sir,
I have to testify about it.

202
00:21:02,688 --> 00:21:08,688
It would not guess? - Is it you, sir,
propose to lie under oath?

203
00:21:11,848 --> 00:21:17,448
I will laugh the whole European Command!
I will never become a general!

204
00:21:17,488 --> 00:21:19,933
28 years working on it!

205
00:21:19,968 --> 00:21:25,008
General, do not panic.
Yes, you are in big problems,

206
00:21:25,048 --> 00:21:29,048
but maybe I can help.
- How? What can you do?

207
00:21:29,088 --> 00:21:33,848
For example, if I were a civilian
I could not testify. - It's true.

208
00:21:33,888 --> 00:21:38,408
For a few months of my release from the army.
If it is, for example, happened today

209
00:21:38,443 --> 00:21:44,288
I could go with the base,
Germany, before anyone finds out anything.

210
00:21:44,328 --> 00:21:49,608
Yes, that's it!
I initiated the process of releasing immediately!

211
00:21:49,648 --> 00:21:54,248
A wise decision. A man I love money
who support their decisions.

212
00:21:54,288 --> 00:21:56,253
What money?

213
00:21:56,288 --> 00:22:03,208
So we will need travel expenses,
and leaving lucrative jobs for themselves.

214
00:22:05,128 --> 00:22:11,648
Vodnièe, it seems to me
hold in hand. - You will not regret it.

215
00:22:21,368 --> 00:22:26,168
You must admit, I'm fairly
well-made drink.

216
00:23:01,448 --> 00:23:06,168
Sorry, mate, what do you like this intrusion,
ali moram pobjeæi od ovih fraulien.

217
00:23:06,208 --> 00:23:08,733
It seems that not one escaped.

218
00:23:08,768 --> 00:23:12,008
Freddy, meine liebe,
You have told me to go.

219
00:23:12,048 --> 00:23:17,048
Sudden command, sugar.
- Ozenit æeš me kao što si obeæao, nein?

220
00:23:17,088 --> 00:23:21,848
Of course, as soon as I get permission
my commanders in Washington.

221
00:23:22,048 --> 00:23:24,928
I will write to him. What is the name?

222
00:23:24,963 --> 00:23:29,688
Lee! General Robert E. Lee!

223
00:23:32,088 --> 00:23:37,448
GeneralRobert E. Lee! -
To see to it that will get in touch.

224
00:23:37,483 --> 00:23:40,688
It is a bit shabby trick, is not it?

225
00:23:40,728 --> 00:23:44,088
I see that you have a lot to learn about women

226
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:49,648
I'll tell you, the more they lie, as above
deal with them, the more you love.

227
00:23:49,683 --> 00:23:53,728
Really? - I could talk these things
about women who make these knock.

228
00:23:53,768 --> 00:23:57,608
I am, unfortunately,
naive in terms of the weaker sex.

229
00:23:57,648 --> 00:24:04,008
The weaker sex? Let me clarify some things:
They are weak and many of these locomotives.

230
00:24:04,048 --> 00:24:07,928
Remember this:
It takes six men to carry to the grave man,

231
00:24:07,968 --> 00:24:10,488
and only one woman that put him there.

232
00:24:10,528 --> 00:24:13,413
I never looked at it so.

233
00:24:13,448 --> 00:24:20,288
I see that you are the man that women
Door opens, keeps them a chair, all of that, right?

234
00:24:20,323 --> 00:24:24,425
I knew to do.
- You know that he started with these antics?

235
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:28,154
An Englishman, named the... Raleigh.
- Sir Walter Raleigh?

236
00:24:28,189 --> 00:24:31,818
Yes, this is the blesavac.
The female wants preæi road,

237
00:24:31,853 --> 00:24:35,448
and he put his coat on the pool
that it crossed over it.

238
00:24:35,488 --> 00:24:38,928
And what happens? It has dry feet,
and he gets sore pluæa.

239
00:24:38,968 --> 00:24:43,328
I really did some things clarified.
- I have not even began.

240
00:24:43,368 --> 00:24:51,088
We are the weaker sex, not women.
We are vulnerable as a ripe peach on a branch.

241
00:24:51,128 --> 00:24:54,208
You're married, right? - Yes.

242
00:24:54,248 --> 00:24:57,208
I see. Got a view uberenog.

243
00:24:57,248 --> 00:25:02,368
Both women and held in hand
and squeezes the juice out of you.

244
00:25:02,408 --> 00:25:04,373
almost hurts.

245
00:25:04,408 --> 00:25:09,008
When you completely drained, throw, and the
country and go look for a new peach.

246
00:25:09,048 --> 00:25:11,048
It is disgusting.

247
00:25:11,088 --> 00:25:14,533
I just say:
Peach world, unite!

248
00:25:14,568 --> 00:25:17,688
Let 'hang on a tree
how much you want.

249
00:25:17,728 --> 00:25:19,608
Amen.

250
00:25:19,848 --> 00:25:26,328
I'll tell you something you never thought of:
The world is full of rich widows.

251
00:25:26,363 --> 00:25:33,368
Do not? - Yes. And where did they hunt?
- oozing peach? - That is correct.

252
00:25:33,408 --> 00:25:38,688
I say it's time for a change.
Let me live a little of them.

253
00:25:38,728 --> 00:25:42,288
Have they give us money.

254
00:25:43,688 --> 00:25:46,728
This is likely to shock a man like you, does not it?

255
00:25:46,768 --> 00:25:53,208
's pretty revolutionary thought.
But how to implement these changes?

256
00:25:53,243 --> 00:25:57,328
This is your brain washed it's pathetic.

257
00:25:57,368 --> 00:26:00,253
Well, it's time to eat.

258
00:26:00,288 --> 00:26:04,848
You probably think I paid a meal?
- of course.

259
00:26:04,888 --> 00:26:06,888
Come with me.

260
00:26:18,048 --> 00:26:21,968
And what do you see? - People eat.

261
00:26:22,008 --> 00:26:24,853
You know what I see? - What?

262
00:26:24,888 --> 00:26:29,248
Three free meals. I just have to choose.

263
00:26:32,368 --> 00:26:35,528
Sit there and look at me.

264
00:26:42,848 --> 00:26:45,908
Ooops ma'am, can I sit here?

265
00:26:45,943 --> 00:26:48,968
If you want to. - Thank you.

266
00:26:52,968 --> 00:26:58,408
Guten tag, izvolite.
- What is the cheapest you eat?

267
00:26:58,448 --> 00:27:02,768
sandwich with liver, the two brands.

268
00:27:02,808 --> 00:27:07,968
It is too much.
I can get just a piece of bread and water?

269
00:27:19,208 --> 00:27:21,093
You are a Frenchman?

270
00:27:21,128 --> 00:27:25,608
No, ma'am, it is only by prayer
I learned my grandmother France.

271
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:29,133
Something is wrong?

272
00:27:29,168 --> 00:27:32,488
Unfortunately, lying sick in hospital
New Orleans

273
00:27:32,523 --> 00:27:35,528
I
I try to save money for the surgery.

274
00:27:35,568 --> 00:27:41,648
Because you eat only bread and water?
- only last six days.

275
00:27:41,683 --> 00:27:47,728
Poor you!
Today you gonna eat more than bread and water.

276
00:27:47,768 --> 00:27:50,928
No, ma'am, I can not
let me pay for a meal.

277
00:27:50,968 --> 00:27:56,928
Bring the best soldier food
what you have, how much you can eat the finest and

278
00:27:56,963 --> 00:27:58,848
Wine.

279
00:28:05,048 --> 00:28:11,608
Have I learned anything?
You could save half past two dollars and eat whatever you want.

280
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:13,448
You were magnificent.

281
00:28:13,488 --> 00:28:15,808
You are not allowed to go.
You missed the best part.

282
00:28:15,848 --> 00:28:18,408
You still brought something?

283
00:28:18,448 --> 00:28:24,248
It gave me 100 francs to send to his ailing grandmother
New Orleans.

284
00:28:24,283 --> 00:28:26,088
Is your sick grandmother?

285
00:28:26,128 --> 00:28:29,648
No, it's part of story.
What francs twenty dollars.

286
00:28:29,688 --> 00:28:31,768
Have you taken a woman twenty U.S. dollars?

287
00:28:31,808 --> 00:28:33,888
No, it's not on my level.

288
00:28:33,928 --> 00:28:38,733
Do not be modest.
Do opportunities. You do not look bad.

289
00:28:38,768 --> 00:28:45,208
Thank you. But I'm old fashioned.
One of those recently harvested peaches.

290
00:28:45,248 --> 00:28:50,008
You could be an excellent team.
I will take the young, you get old.

291
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:53,568
The elderly can take a real hunt.

292
00:28:53,603 --> 00:28:56,573
More than twenty dollars?

293
00:28:56,608 --> 00:29:02,128
A man like you could earn
fifty, one hundred U.S. dollars for dinner.

294
00:29:02,168 --> 00:29:06,808
Is there a name for men
who receive money from a woman?

295
00:29:06,928 --> 00:29:08,493
Yes, smart.

296
00:29:08,528 --> 00:29:11,448
I know you do not need money,
but lives a little, have fun.

297
00:29:11,488 --> 00:29:16,208
No, I do not.
Do: women, family responsibilities.

298
00:29:16,243 --> 00:29:20,088
And we could spend on the Riviera.

299
00:29:20,123 --> 00:29:22,768
Are you going to the Riviera?

300
00:29:22,808 --> 00:29:29,408
Yes, I heard that there is a city full of rich
Women who are called Bonmarte sur Mer.

301
00:29:30,968 --> 00:29:34,768
Have you been to Bonmarte sur Mer? - No.

302
00:29:34,803 --> 00:29:37,368
you are uninformed, unfortunately.

303
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:42,528
All of the social life of peselio
Italian Riviera, Port de fine.

304
00:29:42,568 --> 00:29:46,128
Bonmarte sur Mer was alive, but now prevail

305
00:29:46,168 --> 00:29:50,208
old
couples in retirement. Is dead.

306
00:29:50,248 --> 00:29:52,088
You know that place?

307
00:29:52,128 --> 00:29:56,168
I live there.
Iconsidered urban playboy.

308
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:05,248
But you know what? Some of the biggest of its success
I realize the peaceful gradiæima.

309
00:30:05,283 --> 00:30:06,808
I could throw around.

310
00:30:11,048 --> 00:30:15,088
Sorry, I sent a telegram
women and children.

311
00:30:15,123 --> 00:30:19,128
Always have to tell them exactly
time coming.

312
00:30:20,208 --> 00:30:23,808
Really you have to lead, right?

313
00:30:23,848 --> 00:30:28,368
Yes, I am unfortunately Peach
which it was harvested and stored.

314
00:30:28,408 --> 00:30:32,568
Damage. What I could learn
all about women.

315
00:30:46,088 --> 00:30:50,368
Here we are in boredom.

316
00:30:55,328 --> 00:30:57,928
Those you call this town boredom?

317
00:31:02,248 --> 00:31:06,888
Sorry, I thought this was my compartment.
- It is. We just go down.

318
00:31:09,128 --> 00:31:13,888
This is the Port de fine, right?
- No, we're still in France.

319
00:31:13,928 --> 00:31:17,768
Port de fine only for some 200 miles.

320
00:31:20,968 --> 00:31:25,368
Ouch, my Italian grandmother me sick
waiting there, and I bought the wrong ticket.

321
00:31:25,403 --> 00:31:32,185
Please remain in this compartment,
You are with me to drive to Port de fine.

322
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:38,968
Grazie, signorina. Da bar stignem tamo
With enough money for her surgery.

323
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:44,408
All I did that I come to this money.
- To secure.

324
00:31:46,328 --> 00:31:52,968
Good luck soldier! All the best to your grandmother
Talijanki. - Grazie, signore.

325
00:31:56,848 --> 00:32:01,768
Welcome back, sir.
Your telegram arrived late.

326
00:32:01,808 --> 00:32:04,168
Has a corresponding Italian?

327
00:32:04,208 --> 00:32:06,408
It was the perfect bait.

328
00:32:12,128 --> 00:32:15,133
May I ask why
it was necessary?

329
00:32:15,168 --> 00:32:19,368
Andre, I think Bonmarte sur mer
the hunting reserve of its own.

330
00:32:19,403 --> 00:32:21,808
The soldier was the poachers.

331
00:32:21,848 --> 00:32:24,928
But such a man you would not be
no competition.

332
00:32:24,968 --> 00:32:28,528
It is true, but the man who hunted hare
can drive a real beast.

333
00:32:28,568 --> 00:32:34,008
I think it would be this Italian
your rabbit could long occupy.

334
00:32:38,968 --> 00:32:43,768
LordLarsson-Knudsen,
widow of Swedish match king.

335
00:32:44,568 --> 00:32:49,408
Not if he died two years ago?
- At the age of 91 years.

336
00:32:49,448 --> 00:32:53,128
Here's a picture of his widow.

337
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:59,488
If I live through 91, so I want to go.

338
00:32:59,528 --> 00:33:01,493
When you arrive?

339
00:33:01,528 --> 00:33:06,408
She left the hotel in Genoa this morning at 7:40 vozeæi

340
00:33:06,443 --> 00:33:11,048
Mercedes Swedish table XX274.

341
00:33:18,008 --> 00:33:20,848
This is certainly better than walking.

342
00:33:20,888 --> 00:33:26,128
You are very loyal, but senseless young man
when you thought you could walk up to Stockholm.

343
00:33:26,163 --> 00:33:29,333
I walked to the end of the world to see my grandmother
Švedanku.

344
00:33:29,368 --> 00:33:33,688
As soon as we get to Bonmarte sur mer
gotta send her money for her surgery.

345
00:33:34,368 --> 00:33:38,368
That her car! How odd!
- What?

346
00:33:38,408 --> 00:33:41,568
It is not alone. With her was a soldier.

347
00:33:50,208 --> 00:33:55,608
Returned to poachers? -
It seems that more is not satisfied with the hare.

348
00:35:16,488 --> 00:35:18,488
Have you seen enough?

349
00:35:18,528 --> 00:35:26,648
Indeed I am. Wasting my money I
his grandmother made for the operation of such a girl!

350
00:35:26,683 --> 00:35:30,568
lady, will you sign the complaint?
- be happy.

351
00:35:30,608 --> 00:35:34,928
Congratulations to you
Excellent police work done.

352
00:35:34,968 --> 00:35:37,448
Identify lure so fast!

353
00:35:37,488 --> 00:35:42,808
It is my job, ma'am.
safekeeping our small community of men like him...

354
00:35:42,848 --> 00:35:45,568
and safe for women like you.

355
00:35:46,008 --> 00:35:51,808
I tell you, I stole her money.
She gave it to me.

356
00:35:51,843 --> 00:35:54,453
Potpisala je ovu prituzbu, monsieur.

357
00:35:54,488 --> 00:35:59,308
Has caught me with another woman.
You're French, you understand.

358
00:35:59,343 --> 00:36:04,128
Being a woman with long, it's French.
Being caught, it is U.S..

359
00:36:04,163 --> 00:36:07,293
What should I do? How do I overflow from here?

360
00:36:07,328 --> 00:36:14,208
It will be difficult. The accusation is serious, and
you are a rogue. I know!

361
00:36:14,248 --> 00:36:19,168
Do notI did not. I have this friend.

362
00:36:19,203 --> 00:36:23,328
His name is Lawrence Jameson.

363
00:36:23,368 --> 00:36:30,728
Give please! Our respected A citizen!
How would he know ministers like you?

364
00:36:30,768 --> 00:36:33,493
We're friends.
Sjeæat will be on me.

365
00:36:33,528 --> 00:36:37,128
Just tell him that I
Freddy, rotter from the train.

366
00:36:37,168 --> 00:36:40,768
This is a very serious accusation.
Who will judge this case?

367
00:36:40,808 --> 00:36:44,328
Judge Reno. - Judge Hangman.

368
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:46,568
What kind referee Hangman?

369
00:36:46,608 --> 00:36:50,688
Since it is a U.S. soldier seduced daughter,
man became obsessed.

370
00:36:50,728 --> 00:36:53,253
There must be some alternative.

371
00:36:53,288 --> 00:36:57,768
Suppose obeæa return to U.S.
and never returned.

372
00:36:57,808 --> 00:37:02,648
- It. - Would you give your word?
- I give my word.

373
00:37:02,688 --> 00:37:06,048
The word this man does not mean anything.

374
00:37:06,088 --> 00:37:11,368
I can not let this mad dog
Free at Riviera.

375
00:37:14,328 --> 00:37:19,368
What if I personally escort him to the airport
and board the plane to the U.S.?

376
00:37:19,408 --> 00:37:23,648
Yes, he will get on my plane.
You know you can trust him.

377
00:37:23,688 --> 00:37:28,248
Mr. Jameson, uopæe
why mess with such a pervert?

378
00:37:28,288 --> 00:37:31,808
Do not believe it is broken.
I think it's just emotionally poremeæen.

379
00:37:31,848 --> 00:37:35,428
Right. - His wry attitude toward women

380
00:37:35,463 --> 00:37:38,973
probably cause some childhood trauma.

381
00:37:39,008 --> 00:37:44,728
For example? - Who knows, maybe the poor wretches
uèili where the toilet.

382
00:37:44,763 --> 00:37:46,533
Yes, it is safe.

383
00:37:46,568 --> 00:37:49,533
Dobro, monsieur, ako dajete rijeè

384
00:37:49,568 --> 00:37:53,453
that you will accompany him on a plane,
I'll let him under your supervision.

385
00:37:53,488 --> 00:37:57,208
I will not forget you this.
If you ever arrive at the U.S., look for me in Detroit.

386
00:37:57,243 --> 00:37:59,128
I want to introduce you to my grandmother.

387
00:37:59,163 --> 00:38:00,808
You really have a grandmother?

388
00:38:00,848 --> 00:38:05,608
Favourite woman in the world.
I give the best odds in the entire city.

389
00:38:50,568 --> 00:38:54,488
You are on a special mission for His Highness
, is not it?

390
00:38:54,528 --> 00:38:55,693
What?

391
00:38:55,728 --> 00:38:59,248
I saw the prince as you
give hand and pat him on the shoulder.

392
00:38:59,288 --> 00:39:00,488
Prince?

393
00:39:00,528 --> 00:39:05,528
Do I have to hide.
I am not a security threat.

394
00:39:05,563 --> 00:39:08,093
I have served His Highness.

395
00:39:08,128 --> 00:39:12,088
In fact, probably my money
finance your mission.

396
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:14,288
Are you?

397
00:39:14,328 --> 00:39:20,808
Fanny Eubank. Or, as Prince called me,
Fanny of Omaha.

398
00:39:25,008 --> 00:39:29,808
Yes, the story about you with much respect.

399
00:39:29,843 --> 00:39:32,248
For His Highness!

400
00:39:36,168 --> 00:39:40,128
For the people of his country enslaved!

401
00:39:44,248 --> 00:39:46,368
For your mission!

402
00:39:48,568 --> 00:39:51,408
Do you think it will be successful?

403
00:39:51,448 --> 00:39:54,088
The odds are getting better.

404
00:39:54,728 --> 00:39:59,128
Tell me how much money
Prince managed to get my jewels?

405
00:39:59,168 --> 00:40:02,608
Unfortunately, not enough.

406
00:40:03,128 --> 00:40:09,128
Here, you can safely
believe that thou shalt give him this.

407
00:40:12,568 --> 00:40:14,448
I will give him.

408
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:25,528
Excuse me, sir.

409
00:40:25,968 --> 00:40:27,933
Did I rang, Arthur?

410
00:40:27,968 --> 00:40:31,568
Nothing but the man said,
that is very urgent.

411
00:40:31,603 --> 00:40:33,053
What man?

412
00:40:33,088 --> 00:40:37,928
delivered, sir.
He said that you will know the secret password.

413
00:40:37,963 --> 00:40:41,048
What's the secret password?

414
00:40:41,083 --> 00:40:43,568
Fanny of Omaha.

415
00:40:46,248 --> 00:40:49,053
It would be everything, Arthur.

416
00:40:49,088 --> 00:40:55,968
Arthur, can you take this in a guest room
, and unpack all poglaèati.

417
00:40:56,688 --> 00:41:02,888
delivered did as told.
- Yes, sir.

418
00:41:05,368 --> 00:41:09,893
Your Highness, I bring you bad news:

419
00:41:09,928 --> 00:41:13,688
Your secret is discovered an evil person.

420
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:18,368
maladjusted grandson detriotske kladionièarke.

421
00:41:20,408 --> 00:41:25,568
What a fool I was.
tell you how to cheat a woman.

422
00:41:25,603 --> 00:41:28,408
And you big daddy of us all.

423
00:41:31,208 --> 00:41:33,653
How much do you want?

424
00:41:33,688 --> 00:41:36,853
Your Highness, I can not accept money from a man

425
00:41:36,888 --> 00:41:40,048
to which each novèiæ
to liberate their enslaved people.

426
00:41:40,088 --> 00:41:43,448
Let there be slaves a little bit.
How about $ 5000?

427
00:41:43,483 --> 00:41:48,693
Lord! Teacher!
I came to teach there.

428
00:41:48,728 --> 00:41:53,168
Nauèi me, shape me, dotjeraj me!
I'm in your hands.

429
00:41:53,208 --> 00:41:55,248
I would not even touched them.

430
00:41:55,288 --> 00:41:58,208
Is the story so with your partner?

431
00:41:58,248 --> 00:42:03,128
partner! Do not hit me
to cooperate with someone like you. 're Rude!

432
00:42:03,168 --> 00:42:07,368
As long as oil is not refined in
quality gasoline.

433
00:42:07,408 --> 00:42:09,368
Rafiniraj me, a great dad!

434
00:42:09,408 --> 00:42:11,528
And if you say no?

435
00:42:12,048 --> 00:42:14,968
Attempt!

436
00:42:16,768 --> 00:42:20,648
So you have a rough allurement of women.

437
00:42:20,688 --> 00:42:24,768
Make sure you are unprincipled.
The nature of the lie and cheat.

438
00:42:24,803 --> 00:42:26,853
You have no moral values.

439
00:42:26,888 --> 00:42:31,168
You see, everyone has a good side
If you look for them.

440
00:42:31,208 --> 00:42:34,608
Right. I give you 20% under these conditions:

441
00:42:34,643 --> 00:42:38,008
all odluèujem and I am leading the operation.

442
00:42:38,043 --> 00:42:40,533
You are my leader. Whatever you say.

443
00:42:40,568 --> 00:42:43,728
You cut school, I just ask a few crumbs

444
00:42:43,768 --> 00:42:50,808
I tell you, it will not satisfy even a slice of bread crumbs
even cakes.

445
00:42:50,843 --> 00:42:53,893
At the end will want the whole bakery.

446
00:42:53,928 --> 00:42:57,488
Andre, our bakery.
He has not able to take away.

447
00:42:57,528 --> 00:43:01,168
He is maladjusted, needuciran soldier.

448
00:43:01,203 --> 00:43:04,248
Like Hitler when he started.

449
00:43:04,288 --> 00:43:08,093
I tell you, he will destroy everything.

450
00:43:08,128 --> 00:43:13,293
Is this the face of a man
who you can trust?

451
00:43:13,328 --> 00:43:19,048
Do not. This is the face
predatory animals, monkeys.

452
00:43:19,083 --> 00:43:21,768
Yes, there are similarities.

453
00:43:21,808 --> 00:43:24,528
It is activated by mistake.

454
00:43:24,568 --> 00:43:27,768
I had no choice.
Now you need to turn

455
00:43:27,803 --> 00:43:30,168
the safe, fun monkeys.

456
00:43:51,528 --> 00:43:54,768
Auto you will not last much
If it goes ape.

457
00:43:54,808 --> 00:43:57,013
Secured.

458
00:43:57,048 --> 00:44:04,808
Sad razumijem. Monsieur ima plan.
car in a curve, we loosen the boiler...

459
00:44:04,848 --> 00:44:06,573
It is not an option.

460
00:44:06,608 --> 00:44:09,088
Of course, care of your car.

461
00:44:10,688 --> 00:44:17,048
But I have a better plan.
There is one man who owes me his parole.

462
00:44:17,088 --> 00:44:20,088
Rene called a knife, dagger master and absolute

463
00:44:20,123 --> 00:44:24,008
ma?ionièar in hiding the body.

464
00:44:24,048 --> 00:44:25,973
Andre, murder?

465
00:44:26,008 --> 00:44:33,288
The Inspector
I give you word that the case will be studied very carelessly.

466
00:44:35,088 --> 00:44:37,568
I have another plan! Brilliant plan!
Listen to me!

467
00:44:41,008 --> 00:44:45,688
Hey partners! When shall we begin?
I am ready.

468
00:44:45,728 --> 00:44:49,168
Your tailor sews terrible suits.
Look!

469
00:44:49,208 --> 00:44:51,093
Royal uniforms?

470
00:44:51,128 --> 00:44:54,568
So play the prince. What should I wear? Corner?

471
00:44:54,608 --> 00:44:58,648
But you can emulate that èlana
royal family! It is...

472
00:44:58,688 --> 00:45:03,088
No, no, Andre... He wants to be kraljeviæ,
kraljeviæ and will be!

473
00:45:03,928 --> 00:45:07,893
You should ask the father to you
send all this money.

474
00:45:07,928 --> 00:45:13,168
But you said that you can not go until you
making sure of their poor countrymen.

475
00:45:13,208 --> 00:45:15,728
I feel like a dependent man.

476
00:45:15,763 --> 00:45:18,248
Please do not be mad at me.

477
00:45:18,288 --> 00:45:22,068
It was the only way that you go back
Tulsa.

478
00:45:22,103 --> 00:45:25,848
Dad
build a new church for our wedding.

479
00:45:25,888 --> 00:45:29,013
What do you think you should take a plane?

480
00:45:29,048 --> 00:45:32,368
I think we should go by boat.
Ruprecht loves the sea.

481
00:45:32,403 --> 00:45:35,928
Who Ruprecht? - My brother, the young prince.

482
00:45:35,968 --> 00:45:39,373
Thesehave a brother? And go with us?

483
00:45:39,408 --> 00:45:41,693
Yes, where I'm going, going and Ruprecht.

484
00:45:41,728 --> 00:45:47,448
Well that's great!
Coming home with the two princes!

485
00:45:47,483 --> 00:45:50,448
Let's say Ruprecht good news?

486
00:45:50,488 --> 00:45:55,208
Yes, can not wait to meet him!
Do not you tell me that you have a brother!

487
00:45:55,243 --> 00:45:59,928
It is very withdrawn. Do not zaruèeni,
I would not even met with him now.

488
00:46:13,088 --> 00:46:15,128
What is there in the basement?

489
00:46:15,168 --> 00:46:21,008
His chambers are there. These massive stone walls
provide maximum security.

490
00:46:21,048 --> 00:46:25,928
Ruprecht! I am your brother!
There is someone who wants to know.

491
00:46:33,888 --> 00:46:37,888
Do not be afraid, it is completely harmless. Ruprecht!

492
00:46:43,768 --> 00:46:46,848
Go down Ruprecht! Meet this fine lady.

493
00:46:46,883 --> 00:46:48,333
Mother!

494
00:46:48,368 --> 00:46:53,408
No mother! It was my wife's future,
Your Future sister in law.

495
00:46:53,443 --> 00:46:55,728
Come on, come down!

496
00:46:56,128 --> 00:47:00,008
You do not have to fear èega.
Just do not stop laughing.

497
00:47:07,008 --> 00:47:09,653
Healthy Ruprecht!
- Mother!

498
00:47:09,688 --> 00:47:14,568
No, Ruprecht, but we shall live with this fine lady in
Tulsa, Oklahoma.

499
00:47:14,603 --> 00:47:16,648
Both?

500
00:47:16,688 --> 00:47:19,328
have stopped laughing!

501
00:47:24,048 --> 00:47:27,008
My earrings!
- Continue to laugh!

502
00:47:27,048 --> 00:47:30,528
Do not eat them, Ruprecht!
Tulsa to be bona fide for him.

503
00:47:30,728 --> 00:47:33,133
Level. Can trèkarati around.

504
00:47:33,168 --> 00:47:37,008
We tried to play it here, but it
is constantly falling from the mountain.

505
00:47:37,928 --> 00:47:41,808
Yes, it hurts. But you will not fall over

506
00:47:41,848 --> 00:47:46,448
they will, and this fine lady to lead the
hands all over Tulsa.

507
00:47:46,968 --> 00:47:48,568
Mother?

508
00:47:48,608 --> 00:47:53,128
Well, Ruprecht, and if it usreæuje,
You can call the mother.

509
00:47:53,168 --> 00:47:54,568
Mother!

510
00:47:57,448 --> 00:48:02,408
Once it nauèiš feed,
uopæe not a problem.

511
00:48:02,443 --> 00:48:05,408
And remember to always have to laugh.

512
00:48:05,443 --> 00:48:07,008
Try these.

513
00:48:17,048 --> 00:48:19,888
Ruprecht,there is no cutting at the table!

514
00:48:19,928 --> 00:48:23,548
When we go live with Miss Harrigton
West Palm Beach

515
00:48:23,583 --> 00:48:27,168
and it is a venue for evening
it must allow the food.

516
00:48:27,203 --> 00:48:28,888
Try again.

517
00:48:34,488 --> 00:48:38,208
Enough is enough! Cut one,
but the second bite.

518
00:48:38,248 --> 00:48:40,048
It might be contagious.

519
00:48:40,088 --> 00:48:42,648
Because this is vraæaš down to his room.

520
00:48:42,683 --> 00:48:45,048
Even the okreæe against me.
Back!

521
00:48:47,768 --> 00:48:49,568
Continue to smile!

522
00:48:54,208 --> 00:48:59,208
Thank God, this will happen only
one of our three children.

523
00:49:00,448 --> 00:49:03,088
Travel by car relaxes Ruprecht.

524
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:06,968
Only the smiles!

525
00:49:08,248 --> 00:49:10,888
Very good, Ruprecht!

526
00:49:10,928 --> 00:49:14,968
And when the father of Miss Weddell
is again running for Senate

527
00:49:15,003 --> 00:49:18,688
it can during the campaign
ride across Iowa.

528
00:49:21,288 --> 00:49:26,288
Freddy, we had a very good month.
need to share a car.

529
00:49:26,323 --> 00:49:28,288
Start, share it.

530
00:49:28,928 --> 00:49:31,528
Andre gets 5%...

531
00:49:31,568 --> 00:49:35,408
That's good, my grandmother paid 10th

532
00:49:35,448 --> 00:49:39,108
5% for operational costs,
chateau i ostalo.

533
00:49:39,143 --> 00:49:42,733
I accept that, you have an excellent crate.

534
00:49:42,768 --> 00:49:47,688
Since we had such a good month,
It puts us in a high tax class.

535
00:49:48,808 --> 00:49:52,028
Just a little! Slowly.

536
00:49:52,063 --> 00:49:55,213
Taxes? Which taxes?

537
00:49:55,248 --> 00:49:58,888
You may be asking what I do
with their money.

538
00:49:58,928 --> 00:50:03,048
Your money does not interest me.
What are you doing with my money?

539
00:50:03,083 --> 00:50:05,048
Deduct tax.

540
00:50:06,568 --> 00:50:10,453
Which brings us to my initial questions:
What taxes?

541
00:50:10,488 --> 00:50:14,368
Freddy, you have a goal in life.
To be the tallest tree in the Peach

542
00:50:14,403 --> 00:50:17,733
to
no one can pick and squeeze.

543
00:50:17,768 --> 00:50:22,088
I have a feeling that some fingers
provide for me right now.

544
00:50:22,123 --> 00:50:26,808
And if anyone squeezed me, it
will not be a man.

545
00:50:26,848 --> 00:50:28,493
Listen to me.

546
00:50:28,528 --> 00:50:33,408
Governments use taxes to's general welfare,
I use them for the benefit of the individual.

547
00:50:33,448 --> 00:50:35,368
Who are you in this case.

548
00:50:35,408 --> 00:50:36,928
Do not. Come with me.

549
00:50:36,968 --> 00:50:38,768
Where are we going?

550
00:50:38,808 --> 00:50:42,368
The head of every man
There unopened door.

551
00:50:42,488 --> 00:50:45,208
I just want you
to open new ones.

552
00:50:47,368 --> 00:50:51,888
The family of a man engaged in srebrnarstvom
over 400 years old.

553
00:50:51,928 --> 00:50:55,208
You said to him three months
to finish the bowl.

554
00:50:55,248 --> 00:50:57,968
Plants produce hundreds of them.

555
00:50:58,048 --> 00:51:02,768
artistic works are his superior,
but economically it can not compete.

556
00:51:02,808 --> 00:51:04,413
So let it perish.

557
00:51:04,448 --> 00:51:07,613
Freddy, if this man fails,
his craft will die out.

558
00:51:07,648 --> 00:51:12,168
Moreover, the vanishing way of life
achievements do not measure profits.

559
00:51:12,203 --> 00:51:16,248
And you financiraš it?
And there by my tax money goes?

560
00:51:16,288 --> 00:51:17,853
Part.

561
00:51:17,888 --> 00:51:19,548
And the rest?

562
00:51:19,583 --> 00:51:21,208
Come with me.

563
00:51:25,168 --> 00:51:30,888
This man has devoted his life to discovering the secrets of old masters
violin.

564
00:51:30,923 --> 00:51:34,248
So what if it works better violin?

565
00:51:34,288 --> 00:51:37,573
World music is always spacey.

566
00:51:37,608 --> 00:51:40,688
Meanwhile
You give him money from my taxes?

567
00:51:40,723 --> 00:51:42,648
Yes, enough for life.

568
00:51:42,688 --> 00:51:46,928
Freddy, for many centuries when archaeologists excavated the remains are
our civilization,

569
00:51:46,963 --> 00:51:48,768
want to find the only juke-boxes?

570
00:51:55,088 --> 00:52:00,653
Of course it is a risk. But if you settle
a top ballerina, it's worth.

571
00:52:00,688 --> 00:52:05,408
To the man who created this beautiful tapestry
was not under the auspices of a rich plemiæa

572
00:52:05,443 --> 00:52:09,893
,
the work of art would not exist today.

573
00:52:09,928 --> 00:52:14,288
Do you see what I mean, Freddy,
Money itself is worthless.

574
00:52:14,323 --> 00:52:16,773
It should be used in a proper purpose.

575
00:52:16,808 --> 00:52:21,368
Look, Daddy. Want to play Robin Hood?
OK. But not on my account.

576
00:52:21,403 --> 00:52:25,893
For some archaeologists would not dig, and it
is Freddijev money.

577
00:52:25,928 --> 00:52:30,088
I will because I now spend it.
And because we have delivered it, liberated taxes.

578
00:52:30,123 --> 00:52:32,413
My grandmother always said:

579
00:52:32,448 --> 00:52:37,728
Do not bet on surprises
If you do not want to be a loser.

580
00:52:37,763 --> 00:52:43,008
Something you forget: I have now
I am leading the operation.

581
00:52:43,043 --> 00:52:46,408
I did not know that so we're gonna rob.

582
00:52:46,448 --> 00:52:49,848
Well, Freddy, you shall receive your money

583
00:52:49,968 --> 00:52:54,568
but are you aware that this is the
end of our cooperation.

584
00:52:54,603 --> 00:52:57,888
I'm a big boy, I can.

585
00:52:57,923 --> 00:52:59,968
Where?

586
00:53:10,288 --> 00:53:12,888
Welcome, glad you're here.

587
00:53:16,328 --> 00:53:18,708
Well I'll be here.

588
00:53:18,743 --> 00:53:21,088
This is my territory.

589
00:53:21,123 --> 00:53:22,933
He was.

590
00:53:22,968 --> 00:53:24,688
Hey boy, here.

591
00:53:24,728 --> 00:53:27,208
Who is this girl who has just entered?

592
00:53:27,248 --> 00:53:29,248
Miss Janet Walker.

593
00:53:29,288 --> 00:53:31,173
Who is it?

594
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:33,648
The U.S. soap queen.

595
00:53:33,688 --> 00:53:35,928
OK, thanks.

596
00:53:35,968 --> 00:53:40,288
Yes, I think we'll be good here.

597
00:53:40,328 --> 00:53:43,813
Freddy, you can not I act on this level.

598
00:53:43,848 --> 00:53:47,488
have experienced their peak
Social as my retarded brother.

599
00:53:47,528 --> 00:53:49,928
I know what bothers you.
- What?

600
00:53:49,968 --> 00:53:52,088
I. Competition.

601
00:53:52,128 --> 00:53:56,288
As long rule over the mountain
to think that it possess.

602
00:53:56,328 --> 00:54:01,088
But beware, Freddy climbs
and hungry for success.

603
00:54:01,128 --> 00:54:04,093
Believe me, Freddy, I do not fear thee,

604
00:54:04,128 --> 00:54:08,368
but just on this mountain
no enough room for both.

605
00:54:09,368 --> 00:54:11,128
I agree.

606
00:54:11,168 --> 00:54:13,448
Are you to provoke me?

607
00:54:13,488 --> 00:54:16,888
Did you think to oppose
your raw animal instinct

608
00:54:16,923 --> 00:54:19,208
intelligence, culture and education?

609
00:54:19,248 --> 00:54:23,688
If you ask whether you want
isprašiti here, then yes.

610
00:54:23,723 --> 00:54:26,333
Right. It can.

611
00:54:26,368 --> 00:54:30,488
It appears that you are interested
young lady who has now arrived.

612
00:54:30,523 --> 00:54:32,248
Let it be the test.

613
00:54:32,283 --> 00:54:34,288
OK.

614
00:54:34,328 --> 00:54:36,253
We need to set the amount.

615
00:54:36,288 --> 00:54:40,648
The first to draw some of it
Miss Walker wins.

616
00:54:41,768 --> 00:54:43,853
How much?

617
00:54:43,888 --> 00:54:46,688
Make it easy. 25 thousand?

618
00:54:47,608 --> 00:54:49,488
Can.

619
00:54:49,528 --> 00:54:51,408
The winner gets everything?

620
00:54:51,448 --> 00:54:53,328
The loser is deleted from the city.

621
00:54:53,368 --> 00:54:55,408
Make better win.

622
00:54:55,443 --> 00:54:57,288
Thank you.

623
00:55:23,808 --> 00:55:25,968
is at roulette.

624
00:55:29,968 --> 00:55:32,488
What about Freddie?
- disappeared.

625
00:55:32,523 --> 00:55:34,968
I told you! Rene aka No Knife.

626
00:55:35,008 --> 00:55:39,968
accounta word. No one has seen.
There is.

627
00:55:40,008 --> 00:55:43,928
Maybe
jackal realized that he could not against the lions.

628
00:55:43,968 --> 00:55:47,328
Just you watch. Appears will be the jackal.

629
00:56:41,408 --> 00:56:45,288
to a miss, for me
You can place your bet?

630
00:56:45,323 --> 00:56:47,248
It is difficult doseæi table.

631
00:56:47,288 --> 00:56:50,328
It would be my pleasure.
What number do you want?

632
00:56:50,363 --> 00:56:54,088
To serve me luck, I hoæete
you choose one?

633
00:56:54,128 --> 00:56:56,008
course.

634
00:56:58,968 --> 00:57:02,688
If the U.S. could get at least
enough money for surgery.

635
00:57:02,723 --> 00:57:05,768
Are not you supposed to
pay the army operation?

636
00:57:05,808 --> 00:57:09,688
And no, not for me. For my grandmother.
She is in hospital in Cleveland.

637
00:57:09,728 --> 00:57:12,208
Cleveland? I live there.

638
00:57:12,243 --> 00:57:14,648
Come on!

639
00:57:15,888 --> 00:57:19,288
If you wish me luck.
- Sure.

640
00:57:19,328 --> 00:57:22,328
Do you want me and you want
luck, sir?

641
00:57:27,408 --> 00:57:32,608
1900 francs! Nearly $ 400!

642
00:57:32,648 --> 00:57:37,848
Now, my grandmother can to surgery and again
walk. Thanks to you.

643
00:57:38,808 --> 00:57:42,928
Freddy, would surgery help you?

644
00:57:44,208 --> 00:57:47,688
My problem is not physically
rather than emotional.

645
00:57:47,723 --> 00:57:50,685
Do you want me to talk about it?

646
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:53,648
is terribly painful.
- could help.

647
00:57:54,968 --> 00:58:00,408
I was zaruèen for a girl home
in the United States. But only the dates specified.

648
00:58:00,448 --> 00:58:04,848
The day before I had to fly home,
I got a letter from her.

649
00:58:04,888 --> 00:58:06,853
It is...

650
00:58:06,888 --> 00:58:08,728
It is that, Freddy?

651
00:58:08,768 --> 00:58:12,208
She went and married some dancers.

652
00:58:12,248 --> 00:58:17,048
I had a Lightning Night Sea.
I saw them dancing everywhere.

653
00:58:17,083 --> 00:58:21,208
When I awoke the next morning,
I could not walk.

654
00:58:21,243 --> 00:58:23,293
My legs were canceled.

655
00:58:23,328 --> 00:58:31,928
Oh, Freddy, that traumatic experience.
Do not you be a military psychiatrist help?

656
00:58:31,968 --> 00:58:37,168
Trude they are. Make the best you can,
but I just do not react.

657
00:58:37,208 --> 00:58:40,088
Surely someone can help!

658
00:58:42,128 --> 00:58:44,293
So there is one man.

659
00:58:44,328 --> 00:58:48,888
The famous Swiss psychiatrist.
Specialist for such cases.

660
00:58:48,923 --> 00:58:50,608
Who is he?

661
00:58:50,648 --> 00:58:52,613
Dr. Emil Schuffhausen.

662
00:58:52,648 --> 00:58:55,288
Takes known Schuffhausen clinic
in Lucerne.

663
00:58:55,323 --> 00:58:57,688
Why not go with him?

664
00:58:57,728 --> 00:59:02,288
I wrote to him for months,
but impossible to get a date with him.

665
00:59:02,328 --> 00:59:04,093
Why?

666
00:59:04,128 --> 00:59:07,088
A man like Dr. Schuffhausen
is sought all over the world.

667
00:59:07,123 --> 00:59:09,133
It may require astronomical sums.

668
00:59:09,168 --> 00:59:12,848
Why should we bother with the poor
soldier like me.

669
00:59:12,888 --> 00:59:15,253
What do you mean by astronomical?

670
00:59:15,288 --> 00:59:20,408
I heard it gets per
$ 25000 per case.

671
00:59:20,443 --> 00:59:23,848
Where does my $ 25000?

672
00:59:23,888 --> 00:59:25,888
impossible.

673
00:59:25,928 --> 00:59:28,888
Nothing is impossible, Freddy.

674
00:59:35,768 --> 00:59:40,168
It is beautiful here.
I am really pleased that we are in the same hotel.

675
00:59:40,203 --> 00:59:41,888
And to me.

676
00:59:41,928 --> 00:59:44,208
Come on tomorrow overflow bit in the sun.

677
00:59:44,248 --> 00:59:46,568
Oh, no. You're there to have fun.

678
00:59:46,603 --> 00:59:48,888
Do not waste time brinuæi for me.

679
00:59:48,923 --> 00:59:51,253
Freddy, so unselfish.

680
00:59:51,288 --> 00:59:55,408
you suffer, but I still think only
other.

681
00:59:55,448 --> 00:59:57,848
It is the philosophy of my grandmother.

682
00:59:57,883 --> 00:59:59,848
Obièavala say is:

683
00:59:59,888 --> 01:00:03,688
Even the poorest man may
Robin Hood lucky.

684
01:00:03,728 --> 01:00:06,048
Take of yourself and to others.

685
01:00:06,088 --> 01:00:09,088
How are fortunate to have such a grandmother.

686
01:00:09,128 --> 01:00:11,488
Yes, we helped a lot.

687
01:00:17,648 --> 01:00:20,488
Take me out of here fast.
- What's the problem?

688
01:00:23,088 --> 01:00:26,208
Oh, so sorry. Reminds you of her.

689
01:00:26,248 --> 01:00:28,008
I care.

690
01:00:28,048 --> 01:00:32,328
Come on in your room to write another letter to Dr.
Schuffhausenu.

691
01:00:32,368 --> 01:00:37,248
It is a waste of time.
He understands only one language. Language of money.

692
01:00:37,283 --> 01:00:40,568
Then we will persuade him
that will get their money.

693
01:00:47,288 --> 01:00:50,488
I wish you much
say nice things about me.

694
01:00:50,528 --> 01:00:52,888
It turns out a hero.

695
01:00:52,923 --> 01:00:55,208
Are You a hero.

696
01:00:55,248 --> 01:00:59,248
Not allowed him obeæati money.
Where do I get it?

697
01:00:59,448 --> 01:01:01,653
Leave it to me, Freddy.

698
01:01:01,688 --> 01:01:06,048
When the time came,
I promise that you shall have it.

699
01:01:09,768 --> 01:01:13,048
Freddy! Please do not!

700
01:01:15,048 --> 01:01:18,968
No one before had been good to me except
grandmother.

701
01:01:21,048 --> 01:01:23,888
Give an attempt to gather.

702
01:01:23,928 --> 01:01:27,648
Immediate returns.
I'm going to just send a letter.

703
01:01:39,048 --> 01:01:42,528
The King is dead. Long live the king!

704
01:01:55,328 --> 01:01:57,328
Dr. Schuffhausen!

705
01:01:58,488 --> 01:02:00,688
Dr. Emil Schuffhausen!

706
01:02:01,688 --> 01:02:04,288
Message for Dr. Schuffhausena!

707
01:02:07,888 --> 01:02:10,248
Dr. Emil Schuffhausen?

708
01:02:10,283 --> 01:02:12,088
- Thank you.

709
01:02:13,488 --> 01:02:15,688
LUCK ANDRE PHYSICIAN

710
01:02:19,648 --> 01:02:21,888
Dr. Schuffhausen?
- Yes?

711
01:02:21,928 --> 01:02:25,088
From Schuffhausen clinic in Lucerne?
- Do.

712
01:02:25,128 --> 01:02:28,728
This is a miracle.
I just sent you a letter.

713
01:02:28,768 --> 01:02:31,408
Right. Profit when I ga
back to the clinic.

714
01:02:31,448 --> 01:02:34,128
Can only a moment to talk with you?

715
01:02:34,168 --> 01:02:36,448
Please, I'm on vacation.
Visit me in the clinic.

716
01:02:36,488 --> 01:02:39,908
It is not about me but about a soldier to U.S.
Fred Benson.

717
01:02:39,943 --> 01:02:43,328
You've seen it.
He was sitting next to you at the roulette.

718
01:02:43,368 --> 01:02:46,088
Benson? Is this the one that
I wrote all those letters.

719
01:02:46,123 --> 01:02:48,408
On how his fiancée
eloped with dancers.

720
01:02:48,448 --> 01:02:50,528
Yes, that's that. And right there at the hotel.

721
01:02:50,568 --> 01:02:52,253
Doctor, hoæete review it?

722
01:02:52,288 --> 01:02:55,008
The military psychiatrist will take care of it.

723
01:02:55,043 --> 01:02:57,568
They tried. Only you can help him.

724
01:02:57,603 --> 01:02:59,368
I am always alone.

725
01:02:59,408 --> 01:03:02,088
Freud, Adler, Jung, Schuffhausen.
Who then?

726
01:03:02,128 --> 01:03:05,328
They have to find someone else.
exhaust me.

727
01:03:05,368 --> 01:03:08,568
Doctor, you just know what the sergeant
Benson.

728
01:03:08,603 --> 01:03:12,453
Bold, affectionate, a real hero.

729
01:03:12,488 --> 01:03:16,528
And you can cure it.
How can you refuse?

730
01:03:16,568 --> 01:03:18,988
Why do I always osjeæati guilty?

731
01:03:19,023 --> 01:03:21,373
If it is a matter of money...

732
01:03:21,408 --> 01:03:24,808
You did not give him probably made some money?
- not yet.

733
01:03:24,843 --> 01:03:27,288
Thank God.
I will give you a free advice:

734
01:03:27,328 --> 01:03:28,728
Do not give him any money.

735
01:03:28,768 --> 01:03:30,333
Why not?

736
01:03:30,368 --> 01:03:32,368
You would I make it very difficult job.

737
01:03:32,408 --> 01:03:36,168
You see, his ego has already suffered a severe blow
of a woman.

738
01:03:36,203 --> 01:03:38,253
Take alms of others...

739
01:03:38,288 --> 01:03:42,208
Is it therefore began to cry when I told him that
I will give him money?

740
01:03:42,248 --> 01:03:45,208
course. We do not want to be
it again, right?

741
01:03:45,248 --> 01:03:48,368
Is it, Doc, means
that you will still help him?

742
01:03:48,408 --> 01:03:51,408
I see. But remember:
No money to him!

743
01:03:51,448 --> 01:03:54,848
If you downloadcase,
pay directly to me.

744
01:03:54,888 --> 01:03:56,228
I want, I want.

745
01:03:56,263 --> 01:03:57,568
Where is the boy?

746
01:03:57,608 --> 01:04:00,928
In his room.
It will be thrilled when you see it.

747
01:04:00,963 --> 01:04:03,688
I can not wait to see his reaction.

748
01:04:19,448 --> 01:04:21,368
Forward!

749
01:04:22,128 --> 01:04:25,608
Freddy, I have a wonderful surprise!

750
01:04:25,648 --> 01:04:27,728
Close your eyes!

751
01:04:27,768 --> 01:04:32,568
Who would of all people in this world, except his grandmother
,

752
01:04:32,603 --> 01:04:34,888
now prefer to see?

753
01:04:34,928 --> 01:04:36,893
Cancel, who?

754
01:04:36,928 --> 01:04:39,048
Dr. Emil Schuffhausen!

755
01:04:44,968 --> 01:04:47,488
Finally we get to know, vodnièe Benson.

756
01:04:47,528 --> 01:04:50,288
After all of your letters,
as if I know.

757
01:04:50,323 --> 01:04:52,808
Can not believe you really have to.

758
01:04:52,843 --> 01:04:54,373
Yes, I think that's it.

759
01:04:54,408 --> 01:04:56,808
I'm here to help
you, my boy.

760
01:04:56,848 --> 01:04:59,648
Come on now, look at your feet.

761
01:05:01,328 --> 01:05:04,088
Do Osjeæaš them anything?

762
01:05:04,128 --> 01:05:05,928
No, sir.

763
01:05:14,368 --> 01:05:16,248
Have you felt it?

764
01:05:16,288 --> 01:05:18,088
No, sir.

765
01:05:19,208 --> 01:05:21,008
And this?

766
01:05:21,048 --> 01:05:22,848
No, sir, nothing.

767
01:05:24,848 --> 01:05:26,768
Is this what you feel?

768
01:05:28,528 --> 01:05:31,053
Doctor, it seems so cruel.

769
01:05:31,088 --> 01:05:35,328
On the contrary, Sergeant Benson would bo
happiest when osjeæao pain, right?

770
01:05:35,363 --> 01:05:37,048
Right.

771
01:05:37,448 --> 01:05:39,168
That's right!

772
01:05:56,288 --> 01:05:57,973
This case intrigues me.

773
01:05:58,008 --> 01:06:00,488
Download case I
sergeant Benson.

774
01:06:00,528 --> 01:06:02,733
Freddy, have you heard?

775
01:06:02,768 --> 01:06:06,328
Unajmljujem chateau u blizini
and there we'll move it.

776
01:06:06,368 --> 01:06:09,048
So you can actually pay it.

777
01:06:09,088 --> 01:06:12,813
Doctor, thank you very much.
Will I walk again?

778
01:06:12,848 --> 01:06:17,408
Treat will! I feel back to him in the legs, called
I do not...

779
01:06:17,443 --> 01:06:18,928
Doctor...

780
01:06:18,968 --> 01:06:20,248
Emil...

781
01:06:20,288 --> 01:06:21,768
Schuffhausen!

782
01:06:22,528 --> 01:06:26,648
Look, Doc,
so happy that salary!

783
01:06:32,368 --> 01:06:35,208
This will be your room, Freddy,
and not be afraid, and

784
01:06:35,243 --> 01:06:37,528
hold the eyes day and night.

785
01:06:37,568 --> 01:06:41,648
Freddy, is
You can not believe that this really happening?

786
01:06:43,248 --> 01:06:47,788
Doctor Schuffhausen,
the money can not pay what you are doing.

787
01:06:47,823 --> 01:06:52,328
I wish I could somehow differently
show your appreciation.

788
01:06:52,368 --> 01:06:54,333
About how we can afterwards.

789
01:06:54,368 --> 01:06:58,688
You are more than a doctor.
You are a great humanitarian.

790
01:06:58,728 --> 01:07:02,968
its annual sacrifice,
dijelite svoj chateau...

791
01:07:03,008 --> 01:07:06,608
Freddy, shvaæaš what this man done?

792
01:07:06,643 --> 01:07:08,408
Yes.

793
01:07:08,448 --> 01:07:12,288
Zelite li razgledati chateau?
It has a fascinating history.

794
01:07:12,323 --> 01:07:14,088
Of course, thanks.

795
01:07:14,128 --> 01:07:18,128
Nekoæ davno u ovom chateauu zivio je
prince and his younger brother.

796
01:07:18,168 --> 01:07:23,448
The Prince was a charming man:
Convenient, friendly, generous, clever.

797
01:07:23,488 --> 01:07:25,368
Like you, Doctor.

798
01:07:25,408 --> 01:07:28,848
But his younger brother:
Malicious, sick, rotten.

799
01:07:28,888 --> 01:07:32,328
He was jealous of the prince and
mightily tried to destroy it.

800
01:07:32,368 --> 01:07:34,533
How horrible man!

801
01:07:34,568 --> 01:07:37,748
Then one day a pretty
dama došla u chateau.

802
01:07:37,783 --> 01:07:40,928
She is rich, and
very sweet and innocent.

803
01:07:40,968 --> 01:07:43,728
Prince's malicious she immediately wanted to steal.

804
01:07:43,768 --> 01:07:45,888
But not only money, but honor.

805
01:07:45,923 --> 01:07:47,573
What happened?

806
01:07:47,608 --> 01:07:49,928
With its shabby prevarantstvom, succeeded.

807
01:07:49,968 --> 01:07:52,048
He was really sick and rotten!

808
01:07:52,088 --> 01:07:53,768
Easy to maladjusted.

809
01:07:53,808 --> 01:07:56,608
The bar was a Dr. Schuffhausena
to help him.

810
01:07:56,643 --> 01:07:58,893
Yes, it still might not happen.

811
01:07:58,928 --> 01:08:02,088
That miserable, miserable biæe
would lead to middle life.

812
01:08:02,123 --> 01:08:04,968
Just as you and I'll take care of Freddie.

813
01:08:05,008 --> 01:08:08,848
Najzanimljivije sobe u chateauu
are on the second floor.

814
01:08:08,888 --> 01:08:10,968
What about Freddie?

815
01:08:11,008 --> 01:08:13,728
Come to my room and ready for bed.

816
01:08:13,768 --> 01:08:15,768
Do not make him someone should help?

817
01:08:15,808 --> 01:08:18,088
I want to get used to I'm going to bed.

818
01:08:18,128 --> 01:08:20,208
I would like above!

819
01:08:20,248 --> 01:08:22,013
Come on, so you're not disabled!

820
01:08:22,048 --> 01:08:25,208
Doctor, but he is!
- Only in my head.

821
01:08:25,243 --> 01:08:27,288
But he seems so cruel.

822
01:08:27,328 --> 01:08:30,868
Many of the things you'll do
zones will be cruel to you,

823
01:08:30,903 --> 01:08:34,408
but this is a psychiatric therapy.
You must believe me.

824
01:08:34,443 --> 01:08:36,408
I believe you!

825
01:08:36,448 --> 01:08:38,688
First, I'll show you a dance hall.

826
01:08:38,728 --> 01:08:40,928
Ballroom on the second floor?

827
01:08:40,968 --> 01:08:43,053
It was before the bedroom.

828
01:08:43,088 --> 01:08:46,668
It is an evil prince obešèastio
lovely lady.

829
01:08:46,703 --> 01:08:50,248
And then it's good
Prince turned into a ballroom

830
01:08:50,288 --> 01:08:55,528
to become a music room and joy instead of mourning
and sorrow.

831
01:08:55,563 --> 01:09:00,768
Some say they still can feel good
Presence of Prince in this room.

832
01:09:00,808 --> 01:09:04,208
Yes, I feel. I really feel!

833
01:09:04,248 --> 01:09:07,928
If it's there, I am sure that
you asked her to dance.

834
01:09:16,888 --> 01:09:20,228
Doctor, this is an amazing evening.

835
01:09:20,263 --> 01:09:23,568
Especially what you will do Freddi.

836
01:09:23,608 --> 01:09:27,728
What do I do it I should be
has already been done long ago.

837
01:09:36,448 --> 01:09:40,213
Freddy! What happened?

838
01:09:40,248 --> 01:09:45,888
I heard music, so I dragged up
and then I saw you...

839
01:09:45,923 --> 01:09:48,448
Care to dance.

840
01:09:48,488 --> 01:09:52,488
Oh, miserable, so horrible!

841
01:09:52,528 --> 01:09:55,328
Out of all, let us see how we dance!

842
01:09:57,488 --> 01:09:59,408
You are right.

843
01:10:02,968 --> 01:10:05,053
Now we can see.

844
01:10:05,088 --> 01:10:07,088
Doctor, it's barbaric!

845
01:10:07,128 --> 01:10:10,368
Remember what I told you about
constructive therapy.

846
01:10:10,408 --> 01:10:13,408
Do you know where's the catch. Reach for it!

847
01:10:13,448 --> 01:10:17,768
We have to create a desire for walking
which strengthens the desire to regret.

848
01:10:17,808 --> 01:10:21,608
What is dragged up the evidence that therapy
already operates.

849
01:10:22,808 --> 01:10:24,693
Grebe at the door!

850
01:10:24,728 --> 01:10:26,648
No regrets. I know that it is difficult, but it just will

851
01:10:26,683 --> 01:10:29,928
our strength
Freddy find her.

852
01:10:29,968 --> 01:10:32,013
He failed!

853
01:10:32,048 --> 01:10:36,088
Yes, and will fall again... andAgain...
and again.

854
01:10:37,488 --> 01:10:39,008
There!

855
01:10:43,328 --> 01:10:45,968
Uistinu, monsieur, vi ste genij.

856
01:10:46,008 --> 01:10:49,248
How do you quickly and completely
gain an advantage!

857
01:10:49,288 --> 01:10:51,253
We do not have money.

858
01:10:51,288 --> 01:10:55,068
But the jackal you in a cage. What can you do?

859
01:10:55,103 --> 01:10:58,655
Yes, the truth, no this is a little stagnant.

860
01:10:58,690 --> 01:11:02,208
Mademoiselle Walker
supplies the money, right?

861
01:11:02,248 --> 01:11:06,248
Da, upravo je na putu je za chateau.
Maybe it already has with them.

862
01:11:06,283 --> 01:11:09,088
Monsier je uistinu formidable!

863
01:11:09,128 --> 01:11:14,048
A man who comes to you in a duel,
fighting with an empty gun.

864
01:11:22,968 --> 01:11:24,533
Gardener!

865
01:11:24,568 --> 01:11:26,568
What happened?

866
01:11:33,288 --> 01:11:37,328
But who would steal
mower and drove to her?

867
01:12:03,568 --> 01:12:05,648
Leone, stop the car!

868
01:12:09,248 --> 01:12:11,448
Freddy, whither goest thou?

869
01:12:11,483 --> 01:12:13,808
Freddy, come back!

870
01:12:13,843 --> 01:12:15,928
Freddy, wait!

871
01:12:18,928 --> 01:12:22,773
Freddy, what on earth are you doing on this?

872
01:12:22,808 --> 01:12:25,368
When the gardener was not watching, I climbed it.

873
01:12:25,408 --> 01:12:27,093
But why?

874
01:12:27,128 --> 01:12:30,368
I try to come to the beach
dovuèem to the sea.

875
01:12:30,403 --> 01:12:32,168
You should not attempt to swim.

876
01:12:32,208 --> 01:12:34,208
I never thought to try.

877
01:12:35,048 --> 01:12:38,088
Freddy, you're probably thinking?

878
01:12:38,128 --> 01:12:39,808
It will be a blessing to everyone.

879
01:12:39,848 --> 01:12:42,528
Grandma will get money from the military insurance, etc.

880
01:12:42,568 --> 01:12:46,168
Schuffhausen will not have to waste a year

881
01:12:46,208 --> 01:12:48,408
neither you spend your money on me.

882
01:12:48,448 --> 01:12:52,328
Do not speak of such things,
Money is not important now.

883
01:12:52,368 --> 01:12:56,548
I spent all that you get well... all.

884
01:12:56,583 --> 01:13:00,728
You are a saint. Forget about me.

885
01:13:01,488 --> 01:13:03,453
Leave me.

886
01:13:03,488 --> 01:13:06,008
Not for one moment.

887
01:13:06,048 --> 01:13:08,808
Leone, take mr. Benson in the car.

888
01:13:10,968 --> 01:13:14,208
Please, do not want anyone to be a burden.

889
01:13:14,328 --> 01:13:17,968
Get rid of me. Leave me on the road
and override me.

890
01:13:18,003 --> 01:13:20,608
Look at me, I'm helpless as a baby.

891
01:13:20,648 --> 01:13:23,128
And I'll look after you as a baby.

892
01:13:26,728 --> 01:13:28,448
What is this?

893
01:13:28,483 --> 01:13:30,248
Great.

894
01:13:32,048 --> 01:13:35,368
Will we put a little lotion
and legs, please?

895
01:13:36,728 --> 01:13:39,088
Freddy, exactly are we doing.

896
01:13:41,608 --> 01:13:43,648
Do nothing to feel?

897
01:13:43,688 --> 01:13:46,848
No, but it just continues.
There may be something still happens.

898
01:13:46,888 --> 01:13:48,888
I'm sorry I was so depressed this morning.

899
01:13:48,928 --> 01:13:52,088
I had a difficult session with Dr.
Schuffhausenom morning.

900
01:13:52,128 --> 01:13:54,128
He made me the story about.. her.

901
01:13:54,168 --> 01:13:57,013
More difficult is you
think about it, right?

902
01:13:57,048 --> 01:14:01,728
To my heart at least as legs.
Then I would not have felt this tremendous pain.

903
01:14:02,488 --> 01:14:06,608
But Freddy is a good therapy
talk about it.

904
01:14:06,648 --> 01:14:10,968
Tell me what it was, where you met her.

905
01:14:11,008 --> 01:14:14,373
The CRE.
I guess I trusted her so much.

906
01:14:14,408 --> 01:14:19,528
I never thought it would vjerouèiteljica
could do what she had done.

907
01:14:19,568 --> 01:14:22,288
Especially the second vjerouèitelju.

908
01:14:22,328 --> 01:14:24,608
You were vjerouèitelj?

909
01:14:24,648 --> 01:14:27,328
Yes. I adore children.

910
01:14:28,688 --> 01:14:34,408
When I think of all those tiny legs
I directed the right way...

911
01:14:34,443 --> 01:14:37,968
Now you can not even her.

912
01:14:38,008 --> 01:14:41,448
Freddy, you gonna walk again.

913
01:14:44,248 --> 01:14:46,728
Prièaj me more about it.

914
01:14:46,768 --> 01:14:50,133
We walked for about three years and then

915
01:14:50,168 --> 01:14:53,368
a dinner when we vraæali home from choir rehearsal

916
01:14:53,403 --> 01:14:55,093
I kissed her.

917
01:14:55,128 --> 01:14:59,448
You will not believe me, but this is the first girl I kissed

918
01:14:59,483 --> 01:15:01,608
knowing you, I believe.

919
01:15:01,648 --> 01:15:05,728
And then they took away my prayer, and
made me a gun.

920
01:15:05,768 --> 01:15:07,768
She kissed me goodbye.

921
01:15:09,768 --> 01:15:15,168
When you think that my last kiss will
be an adulterous kiss.

922
01:15:15,208 --> 01:15:19,148
Do not Freddy! Would you kiss many women.

923
01:15:19,183 --> 01:15:23,088
Kiss of pity perhaps, but never love.

924
01:15:23,128 --> 01:15:25,493
Do not be silly!

925
01:15:25,528 --> 01:15:29,208
You're The attractive one,
an exciting man.

926
01:15:30,448 --> 01:15:33,848
Have I The attractive and exciting to you?

927
01:15:46,328 --> 01:15:49,408
Dr. Schuffhausen! Just a bit...
It is...

928
01:15:49,448 --> 01:15:54,048
Freddy osjeæao be so depressed.
I just wanted it a little cheer.

929
01:15:54,088 --> 01:15:55,768
Poor I, Doc.

930
01:15:55,808 --> 01:15:57,528
Indeed you are.

931
01:15:57,568 --> 01:15:59,733
The driver was passed down to the beach

932
01:15:59,768 --> 01:16:03,368
I thought it would warm sun and sand
be good for him.

933
01:16:03,408 --> 01:16:07,648
In fact, the warm sand to a bona fide
Physical therapy for Freddie.

934
01:16:07,688 --> 01:16:12,568
Do it now no longer used
the warm sand, lots of hot sand.

935
01:16:17,128 --> 01:16:19,608
Do not
already time to pick up Freddie?

936
01:16:19,643 --> 01:16:21,373
We'll give him another hour.

937
01:16:21,408 --> 01:16:24,528
Believe me, the warm sand treatment
is exactly what he needs.

938
01:16:29,488 --> 01:16:32,613
Psychiatric speaking, when you

939
01:16:32,648 --> 01:16:35,128
Freddie kissed his bespomoænost nagra?ivala you.

940
01:16:35,168 --> 01:16:37,448
So encourage regression.

941
01:16:37,488 --> 01:16:39,728
But it was I was so sorry.

942
01:16:39,768 --> 01:16:44,488
The srcedrapajuæa story that took him
prayer and gave the rifle...

943
01:16:44,523 --> 01:16:47,488
And then it vjerouèiteljica trick!

944
01:16:47,528 --> 01:16:49,368
It must be touched and you!

945
01:16:49,403 --> 01:16:51,168
I'm sick of it.

946
01:16:51,208 --> 01:16:53,208
But we must hide our compassion.

947
01:16:53,248 --> 01:16:56,648
Any sign of attention at this time
will only slow down its progress.

948
01:16:57,408 --> 01:17:00,488
I will try, Doctor,
but it will not be easy.

949
01:17:00,528 --> 01:17:06,008
A person like Freddy pulled out of you
kindness, tenderness and love.

950
01:17:08,768 --> 01:17:11,928
Hariette, I know you love me,
but really I'm not hungry.

951
01:17:14,568 --> 01:17:17,048
This is how I will tell you, Miss Walker.

952
01:17:17,088 --> 01:17:19,888
There are many beaches that we heal this boy.

953
01:17:19,923 --> 01:17:22,568
Do not jeopardize my progress.

954
01:17:22,608 --> 01:17:24,613
I will, Doctor.

955
01:17:24,648 --> 01:17:27,448
What is money As for, you'll
eek to you within 48 hours.

956
01:17:27,488 --> 01:17:29,173
Do not think about money.

957
01:17:29,208 --> 01:17:33,253
It is only important what will happen with the boy
slijedeæih in 48 hours.

958
01:17:33,288 --> 01:17:37,008
We need to create in him a desire for walking
who will be so strong that they will prevail

959
01:17:37,043 --> 01:17:39,608
every other instinct.

960
01:17:39,648 --> 01:17:41,328
Whatever you say.

961
01:17:41,368 --> 01:17:43,248
They will not want to leave it again.

962
01:17:43,288 --> 01:17:46,493
Our job now is to him,
so aggravating to be with us...

963
01:17:46,528 --> 01:17:50,608
That would literally iskoèiti
from these carts to achieve this.

964
01:17:50,648 --> 01:17:52,888
Will withstand the temptation?

965
01:17:52,923 --> 01:17:54,608
I promise.

966
01:17:57,128 --> 01:17:59,208
Do not look back.

967
01:18:14,488 --> 01:18:18,928
Doctor, you do not know if this helps
Freddi, osjeæala'd be wrong.

968
01:18:25,608 --> 01:18:29,928
Harriette, this is between me and you just do not go
. Get out now!

969
01:18:49,888 --> 01:18:52,288
Trying to follow us.
- Okay.

970
01:19:44,608 --> 01:19:49,168
I know I promised, doctors,
but how he can handle this?

971
01:19:49,208 --> 01:19:51,088
A little more, I think.

972
01:19:52,728 --> 01:19:54,773
It seems totally desperate.

973
01:19:54,808 --> 01:19:58,888
It is good. We are approaching the peak.
We must not give up now.

974
01:20:11,488 --> 01:20:14,168
Excellent dancer, Freddy.

975
01:20:14,208 --> 01:20:16,488
Would not want you to dance with her now?

976
01:20:18,448 --> 01:20:21,928
Come on, boy, get up from that chair!
dancing with a girl!

977
01:20:22,848 --> 01:20:26,448
Well, if you want to just sit there
and miss all the fun.

978
01:20:28,848 --> 01:20:30,968
Hey old man, who is this nit?

979
01:20:31,008 --> 01:20:33,608
Something like this abomination I have never seen.

980
01:20:33,643 --> 01:20:35,653
Ruga is disabled!

981
01:20:35,688 --> 01:20:38,088
"Get up and dance," he says!

982
01:20:38,128 --> 01:20:40,168
I showed him!

983
01:20:40,208 --> 01:20:44,408
It would not bother me so much,
just before she was my girlfriend.

984
01:20:44,448 --> 01:20:46,248
He took it to me.

985
01:20:46,288 --> 01:20:48,208
What garbage!

986
01:20:48,888 --> 01:20:53,288
I know that I could return it,
only if I could remove it for a few days.

987
01:20:55,408 --> 01:20:57,528
Old, Consider it performed.

988
01:20:57,568 --> 01:21:00,648
A transport plane tonight polijeæe for Iceland.

989
01:21:00,683 --> 01:21:02,848
Do you want it to be on it?

990
01:21:04,128 --> 01:21:06,448
Boys...

991
01:21:06,488 --> 01:21:08,488
I think I'm gonna cry.

992
01:21:16,408 --> 01:21:18,388
Everything is ready?

993
01:21:18,423 --> 01:21:20,368
Znate doæi do chateaua?

994
01:21:20,403 --> 01:21:22,448
We will wait.

995
01:21:28,408 --> 01:21:31,808
Do not be discouraged.
Today we have a lot of progress.

996
01:21:31,848 --> 01:21:34,573
We can save on something big.

997
01:21:34,608 --> 01:21:37,648
Hope. I could not pass through
one such evening.

998
01:21:37,688 --> 01:21:39,168
Good Evening!

999
01:21:39,208 --> 01:21:41,208
Telegram for you, Miss Walker.

1000
01:21:42,048 --> 01:21:44,248
Thank you. Excuse me, Doctor.

1001
01:21:49,768 --> 01:21:52,728
Excellent! I'll have your money tomorrow.

1002
01:21:52,768 --> 01:21:56,808
Dad sold the car and furniture,
the sale of fur I've already agreed.

1003
01:21:56,848 --> 01:22:00,568
And with $ 5000 of prizes
I have more than enough for your fee.

1004
01:22:00,608 --> 01:22:02,288
The prize?

1005
01:22:02,328 --> 01:22:06,288
Yes! I got the money, furs, furniture,
and this trip to Europe

1006
01:22:06,328 --> 01:22:08,008
to win the competition.

1007
01:22:08,048 --> 01:22:09,728
What competition?

1008
01:22:09,768 --> 01:22:11,488
to the American soap queen.

1009
01:22:12,088 --> 01:22:15,168
Your father does not own soap
U.S. companies?

1010
01:22:15,208 --> 01:22:17,488
For God's sake, no!
I only work there.

1011
01:22:19,048 --> 01:22:22,008
Freddy, you put it in your head: Waste Money.

1012
01:22:22,048 --> 01:22:24,688
The girl was poor,
it does not have this money.

1013
01:22:24,723 --> 01:22:26,488
It can gather.

1014
01:22:26,528 --> 01:22:28,848
Only if you sell all you possess.

1015
01:22:28,888 --> 01:22:32,368
What do I care where it?
Hunt is a hunt. The bet is worth.

1016
01:22:32,403 --> 01:22:35,488
Do nothing
osjeæaš to this girl?

1017
01:22:35,523 --> 01:22:37,088
course.

1018
01:22:37,128 --> 01:22:39,808
When you get the money, it's the next one.

1019
01:22:39,848 --> 01:22:42,448
Maybe a little hurt, but try to think.

1020
01:22:42,483 --> 01:22:44,488
I drove into a corner.

1021
01:22:44,528 --> 01:22:47,048
We'll see who's who drove.

1022
01:22:47,083 --> 01:22:48,648
I go.

1023
01:22:48,688 --> 01:22:52,148
Well, you can not talk on my level.
I will bedown to yours.

1024
01:22:52,183 --> 01:22:55,608
The only emotion you provoke
When the pity these girls.

1025
01:22:55,643 --> 01:22:57,528
And brkaš with sex.

1026
01:22:57,568 --> 01:23:01,208
One thing that Freddy Benson
with no means do not confuse sex.

1027
01:23:01,248 --> 01:23:04,168
The girl is mine whenever I want it.

1028
01:23:06,288 --> 01:23:08,533
take care of the girl?

1029
01:23:08,568 --> 01:23:11,288
Forget the money.
We bet on it.

1030
01:23:11,688 --> 01:23:13,368
Are you kidding?

1031
01:23:13,408 --> 01:23:15,088
Is it worth the bet?

1032
01:23:15,128 --> 01:23:17,168
Janet is a decent girl.

1033
01:23:17,208 --> 01:23:19,008
Is it worth the bet?

1034
01:23:19,048 --> 01:23:21,128
How can you use such a girl?

1035
01:23:21,163 --> 01:23:22,665
Is it worth the bet?

1036
01:23:22,700 --> 01:23:24,168
Well, it's worth!

1037
01:23:24,208 --> 01:23:25,533
But I'm not competing.

1038
01:23:25,568 --> 01:23:27,728
I bet you that you will not succeed.
Do you know why?

1039
01:23:27,763 --> 01:23:29,213
Tell me.

1040
01:23:29,248 --> 01:23:33,688
Do you remember silversmithsz? Violin?
Uèiteljice ballet?

1041
01:23:33,728 --> 01:23:38,888
They are artists who strive for perfection,
difficult to create something extraordinary.

1042
01:23:38,928 --> 01:23:42,573
Janet is exceptional, and you
you will not destroy it.

1043
01:23:42,608 --> 01:23:46,528
I would not let you throw a match on Stradivardijevu
Violin

1044
01:23:46,563 --> 01:23:49,133
or to quench the Eik Michelagelovu sculpture.

1045
01:23:49,168 --> 01:23:53,608
The reason why you would not have given
to become king of the mountain

1046
01:23:53,648 --> 01:23:56,248
This is to make it into a junkyard.

1047
01:24:05,768 --> 01:24:07,488
What do you want?

1048
01:24:07,523 --> 01:24:09,208
Blokiraš my entry!

1049
01:24:09,248 --> 01:24:10,928
Captain's behind.

1050
01:24:10,968 --> 01:24:12,648
Move your truck!

1051
01:24:12,688 --> 01:24:14,488
Contact the Captain!

1052
01:24:14,523 --> 01:24:16,208
Satnièe!

1053
01:24:31,528 --> 01:24:35,448
Freddy! I thought that the
Dr. Schuffhausen took her home.

1054
01:24:35,488 --> 01:24:39,248
Yes, but I could not sleep.
I had to talk with you.

1055
01:24:39,283 --> 01:24:41,088
Of course, dear.

1056
01:24:42,248 --> 01:24:45,168
Would you want me to walk again?

1057
01:24:45,208 --> 01:24:48,808
Of course you would, you know it.
has made what I was.

1058
01:24:48,848 --> 01:24:50,688
I think there is a way.

1059
01:24:50,728 --> 01:24:52,368
What? Tell me.

1060
01:24:52,408 --> 01:24:55,693
I've been thinking aboutwhat I
Dr.

1061
01:24:55,728 --> 01:24:58,608
Schuffhausen always said that I would walk
I have a strong enough desire.

1062
01:24:58,643 --> 01:25:00,653
Yes. And I said it.

1063
01:25:00,688 --> 01:25:04,488
You're the only person in the world
that we can create that desire.

1064
01:25:04,523 --> 01:25:06,128
What can I do?

1065
01:25:06,168 --> 01:25:10,008
Dr. Schuffhausen said that because
I love put into these carts

1066
01:25:10,043 --> 01:25:12,008
that I love and need to extract from them.

1067
01:25:12,048 --> 01:25:13,528
To?

1068
01:25:13,568 --> 01:25:15,608
I love Janet.

1069
01:25:15,648 --> 01:25:17,248
In you.

1070
01:25:19,088 --> 01:25:20,768
Freddy!

1071
01:25:20,808 --> 01:25:23,048
I was terribly afraid that I will be denied.

1072
01:25:23,088 --> 01:25:24,853
No, do not!

1073
01:25:24,888 --> 01:25:28,688
If this time I refused,
I will walk as long as I live.

1074
01:25:28,723 --> 01:25:30,488
Nemo so to speak!

1075
01:25:30,528 --> 01:25:34,608
I can not help.
I'm afraid that my love will not be uzvraæena.

1076
01:25:34,643 --> 01:25:36,608
It will be! It is.

1077
01:25:36,648 --> 01:25:39,288
If you are disappointed again, I'm gonna kill it!

1078
01:25:39,328 --> 01:25:42,408
You will not be disappoint. Try me!

1079
01:25:42,448 --> 01:25:44,653
Fear me, fear me.

1080
01:25:44,688 --> 01:25:48,728
But I love you, Freddy.
Please try to get up.

1081
01:25:49,248 --> 01:25:51,328
Do not lie to me like it.

1082
01:25:51,368 --> 01:25:55,768
No, Freddy, no.
Please try to get up! For me!

1083
01:26:07,848 --> 01:26:10,368
I stand. I'm standing!

1084
01:26:10,408 --> 01:26:12,968
Yes. Now walk towards me!

1085
01:26:13,008 --> 01:26:14,728
I can. I can not.

1086
01:26:14,768 --> 01:26:16,533
Attempt to please!

1087
01:26:16,568 --> 01:26:18,168
You will not disappoint me?

1088
01:26:18,208 --> 01:26:19,573
Do not! No!

1089
01:26:19,608 --> 01:26:21,128
You're gonna love the me?

1090
01:26:21,168 --> 01:26:22,568
Yes! Yes!

1091
01:26:27,808 --> 01:26:29,493
Look, I'm walking!

1092
01:26:29,528 --> 01:26:32,968
Yes, my dear! Come to me!

1093
01:26:35,568 --> 01:26:37,728
Now you have to sit and relax.

1094
01:26:37,768 --> 01:26:41,928
Not yet. Now that I am on my feet,
I want to see how far they can go.

1095
01:26:41,963 --> 01:26:45,528
Stop over at the door
to try to come up to you.

1096
01:26:55,528 --> 01:26:57,408
My dear!

1097
01:26:57,448 --> 01:27:00,288
Please, have a rest now.

1098
01:27:00,328 --> 01:27:04,208
No, I stand at the bed.
Give out there to try to come up to you.

1099
01:27:07,808 --> 01:27:09,688
Come to me, Freddy!

1100
01:27:09,728 --> 01:27:13,248
Janet, my love,
give me new strength.

1101
01:27:21,168 --> 01:27:22,768
I did it!

1102
01:27:22,803 --> 01:27:24,368
Are, You did!

1103
01:27:24,408 --> 01:27:26,408
And just because you love me!

1104
01:27:26,448 --> 01:27:28,048
All the love you, Freddy.

1105
01:27:32,528 --> 01:27:35,408
These are the most beautiful moments in life
physician.

1106
01:27:35,443 --> 01:27:37,488
When you can prevent tragedy.

1107
01:27:37,528 --> 01:27:40,128
It is no wonder that they call you a genius.

1108
01:27:40,163 --> 01:27:42,728
You said you would come tonight and he came.

1109
01:27:42,763 --> 01:27:45,408
You said you would walk and walk it.

1110
01:27:45,448 --> 01:27:48,248
Freddy, this man works miracles!

1111
01:27:48,283 --> 01:27:50,208
It's starting to believe.

1112
01:27:50,248 --> 01:27:52,688
Come, my boy, you had
iscrpljujuæu evening.

1113
01:27:58,488 --> 01:28:02,288
Only one thing interests me:
How did you disembark from the plane?

1114
01:28:02,328 --> 01:28:04,328
I have not even boarded.

1115
01:28:05,008 --> 01:28:08,448
There were six paratroopers in that plane.

1116
01:28:08,483 --> 01:28:10,048
Seven.

1117
01:28:10,608 --> 01:28:13,048
Parachute Regiment. British army.

1118
01:28:21,168 --> 01:28:24,568
Guys, here's a great Dad and šepavca!

1119
01:28:24,608 --> 01:28:27,648
I can walk just as
Big Daddy said.

1120
01:28:27,688 --> 01:28:30,288
Gentlemen, here comes another food and champagne.

1121
01:28:32,048 --> 01:28:36,048
In the meantime, you can have fun
our friends until I come back?

1122
01:28:45,808 --> 01:28:50,088
Try, my friend, come to the key of
and you will really need a stroller.

1123
01:28:55,328 --> 01:28:58,928
Doctor, can I just phone call
Freddie?

1124
01:28:58,968 --> 01:29:01,573
No, you have to believe me about this.

1125
01:29:01,608 --> 01:29:05,488
But I love Freddie and I think he likes me and
if the cured...

1126
01:29:05,528 --> 01:29:09,648
And why is cured?
Because you followed my instructions without complaint.

1127
01:29:09,683 --> 01:29:12,253
Do I have to admit,
you were all right.

1128
01:29:12,288 --> 01:29:16,528
I am right now. You and Freddy
've passed through a very emotional period, and

1129
01:29:16,568 --> 01:29:21,168
what do you think that love is perhaps the only consequence of this
Emotionalexperiences.

1130
01:29:21,208 --> 01:29:22,888
But I know that I love him.

1131
01:29:22,928 --> 01:29:25,008
And more importantly it
going to a couple of weeks.

1132
01:29:25,048 --> 01:29:26,648
If you like, will come to you.

1133
01:29:26,688 --> 01:29:28,368
Trust me just this once.

1134
01:29:29,328 --> 01:29:31,008
Well, Doctor.

1135
01:29:34,048 --> 01:29:35,813
And your fee?

1136
01:29:35,848 --> 01:29:38,368
I know how to come up to you. I will send my account.

1137
01:29:38,403 --> 01:29:40,328
Beautiful You, Dr. Schuffhausen.

1138
01:29:40,368 --> 01:29:43,728
And I will never forget
What you make of Freddie.

1139
01:29:43,768 --> 01:29:46,008
And I'm sure Freddy will not either.

1140
01:29:46,043 --> 01:29:48,088
I'm sure of it.

1141
01:30:04,328 --> 01:30:06,408
Telegram for you, Miss Walker.

1142
01:30:06,448 --> 01:30:07,928
Thank you.

1143
01:30:15,008 --> 01:30:18,733
With regard to your request

1144
01:30:18,768 --> 01:30:21,448
I must inform you that Dr. Schuffhausen died 1927th

1145
01:30:26,968 --> 01:30:29,448
Please return my luggage at the hotel.

1146
01:30:32,808 --> 01:30:34,488
How's it going, guys?

1147
01:30:35,808 --> 01:30:37,493
Where is Freddy?

1148
01:30:37,528 --> 01:30:42,088
Freddy? And Freddy! He tried to escape, so we made
parachutist from him.

1149
01:30:42,128 --> 01:30:45,488
He performed his first jump
about half an hour ago.

1150
01:31:07,288 --> 01:31:10,688
Can you hear the blast of the train?
Ode to your bet.

1151
01:31:10,723 --> 01:31:12,688
Janet on this train.

1152
01:31:14,648 --> 01:31:16,368
Do not believe it.

1153
01:31:16,408 --> 01:31:18,088
See for yourself.

1154
01:31:29,168 --> 01:31:30,768
Janet!

1155
01:31:33,008 --> 01:31:34,608
Janet!

1156
01:31:36,368 --> 01:31:37,888
Freddy!

1157
01:31:38,368 --> 01:31:41,728
Pokušala sam te nazvati u chateau.
Look at this!

1158
01:31:46,328 --> 01:31:48,368
Doctor's fake?

1159
01:31:49,168 --> 01:31:50,768
You lied to us?

1160
01:31:50,808 --> 01:31:52,688
Yes, but why do it?

1161
01:31:54,248 --> 01:31:56,048
To get your money!

1162
01:31:56,768 --> 01:31:58,768
It is likely a fraud!

1163
01:32:00,808 --> 01:32:02,528
How awful!

1164
01:32:04,848 --> 01:32:06,848
The legs are numb me again!

1165
01:32:06,883 --> 01:32:08,848
Freddy, you must not allow it!

1166
01:32:09,528 --> 01:32:11,093
It's over!

1167
01:32:11,128 --> 01:32:13,008
Freddy, please, get up!

1168
01:32:13,048 --> 01:32:16,128
I can. All I was released. Even you.

1169
01:32:16,163 --> 01:32:18,608
I would never issued!

1170
01:32:19,248 --> 01:32:21,528
You left without me greet.

1171
01:32:21,568 --> 01:32:23,968
Just because the doctor insisted.

1172
01:32:24,288 --> 01:32:27,848
Do not blame him. False You like him.

1173
01:32:28,328 --> 01:32:31,208
Freddy, do not say that.

1174
01:32:31,848 --> 01:32:34,848
You promised that you shall love me,
And then you ran away.

1175
01:32:35,768 --> 01:32:37,968
You are the same as Beatrice!

1176
01:32:38,003 --> 01:32:40,648
I love you! I swear!

1177
01:32:40,688 --> 01:32:44,968
Get up! Walk up to me!
Come to this evidence?

1178
01:32:45,008 --> 01:32:47,648
No, you will not do that again!

1179
01:32:47,683 --> 01:32:50,288
Dear, I will not disappoint you.

1180
01:32:50,323 --> 01:32:52,968
Please, please, come to me!

1181
01:32:55,048 --> 01:32:57,688
Janet, do not fail me.

1182
01:32:57,728 --> 01:33:01,128
I will not, my beloved.

1183
01:33:01,168 --> 01:33:04,008
My dear! My heart!

1184
01:33:04,043 --> 01:33:06,445
Ljubavnièe my!

1185
01:33:06,480 --> 01:33:08,848
Be good to me.

1186
01:33:08,888 --> 01:33:10,808
I want, I want!

1187
01:33:24,928 --> 01:33:26,728
Mr. Jameson!

1188
01:33:28,568 --> 01:33:30,448
Mr. Jameson, wake up!

1189
01:33:30,483 --> 01:33:32,293
What's the problem?

1190
01:33:32,328 --> 01:33:34,608
It would be wise to lezeæi hear the news.

1191
01:33:34,648 --> 01:33:36,428
Lord, all is lost.

1192
01:33:36,463 --> 01:33:38,173
What do you mean?

1193
01:33:38,208 --> 01:33:42,248
Jackal was this morning seen to leave the room
Miss Walker.

1194
01:33:42,288 --> 01:33:44,888
Do not worry about the jackal, I took out his teeth.

1195
01:33:44,928 --> 01:33:47,128
Do not worry about his teeth.

1196
01:33:47,168 --> 01:33:49,248
Miss Walker was with him.

1197
01:33:51,408 --> 01:33:53,208
But I settled on the train.

1198
01:33:53,243 --> 01:33:55,008
Then someone took her.

1199
01:33:55,048 --> 01:33:57,128
They spent the night together.

1200
01:33:57,888 --> 01:34:01,528
Of course, there is always a chance
if nothing had happened.

1201
01:34:01,563 --> 01:34:04,888
Maybe they play cards or read books.

1202
01:34:05,888 --> 01:34:09,448
I hear that Americans are
very strange in that regard.

1203
01:34:09,483 --> 01:34:12,608
Freddy is in this respect a true Frenchman.

1204
01:34:12,643 --> 01:34:14,968
Then it really all is lost.

1205
01:34:23,488 --> 01:34:25,648
Arrived jackal.

1206
01:34:25,688 --> 01:34:28,848
Not more jackal, now is the lion.

1207
01:34:28,883 --> 01:34:32,008
Ne, monsieur, u srcu je još šakal.

1208
01:34:32,048 --> 01:34:35,328
And there's only one way
to overflow to the end with him.

1209
01:34:35,363 --> 01:34:37,328
This Luger...

1210
01:34:38,768 --> 01:34:43,128
He was the personal property
Hermann Goring.

1211
01:34:43,163 --> 01:34:46,688
Only his fingerprints on it.

1212
01:34:46,728 --> 01:34:50,333
And if you discover that his...
What can I do?

1213
01:34:50,368 --> 01:34:54,688
Andre, my friend,
We had a long and successful reign.

1214
01:34:54,723 --> 01:34:57,893
Now we have dignity
accept defeat.

1215
01:34:57,928 --> 01:35:01,768
I only regret that it has achieved
His victory at the expense Miss Walker.

1216
01:35:01,803 --> 01:35:03,848
And because it is done...

1217
01:35:03,888 --> 01:35:08,008
Almost I came to let you make use of the gun
Mr. Goring.

1218
01:35:08,048 --> 01:35:09,848
I said "almost. "

1219
01:35:14,128 --> 01:35:17,848
Not to me that he loosened the car
car

1220
01:35:17,888 --> 01:35:20,568
not to give me a call Rene aka Knife,

1221
01:35:20,603 --> 01:35:23,253
Not that we build on this gun.

1222
01:35:23,288 --> 01:35:26,448
How will expected to rule the law and order?

1223
01:35:30,448 --> 01:35:32,448
Congratulations.

1224
01:35:32,488 --> 01:35:34,808
I did not think it'll succeed, but you are.

1225
01:35:34,848 --> 01:35:37,248
Now you are... the King of the mountain.

1226
01:35:38,688 --> 01:35:40,808
King of the mountain?

1227
01:35:41,848 --> 01:35:44,893
I'm just a sewer rat.

1228
01:35:44,928 --> 01:35:48,448
I've destroyed the life of a girl last night.

1229
01:35:49,328 --> 01:35:52,528
Freddy, I've heard that people grow
the third row of teeth, but

1230
01:35:52,568 --> 01:35:55,048
Is it possible that you developed a conscience

1231
01:35:55,608 --> 01:35:59,008
I do not know, but I hate myself for it
I did it.

1232
01:35:59,043 --> 01:36:01,848
How can I be so bad to so good
leaking?

1233
01:36:01,883 --> 01:36:04,928
What kind of life she can hope for?

1234
01:36:04,963 --> 01:36:07,448
Married to tramp like me.

1235
01:36:09,528 --> 01:36:11,448
Married?

1236
01:36:13,328 --> 01:36:16,048
You watch the picked peach, Daddy.

1237
01:36:16,088 --> 01:36:19,548
And it's all your fault.
You and your moral philosophy.

1238
01:36:19,583 --> 01:36:23,008
There has been, just wait until
to be mine, that I take.

1239
01:36:23,048 --> 01:36:25,488
And suddenly it can not pipnuti.
I love it.

1240
01:36:25,528 --> 01:36:27,608
It is no longer a piece. Now it...

1241
01:36:27,888 --> 01:36:31,288
Rembrandt's paintings, Michelangelo's sculpture
,

1242
01:36:31,328 --> 01:36:33,208
Stradivardiusova violin.

1243
01:36:33,248 --> 01:36:35,448
To go to bed with the museum?

1244

1277
01:38:16,208 --> 01:38:20,048
This is a very simple question.
Mr. Benson was happier.

1278
01:38:20,088 --> 01:38:22,888
Compared with him, I am unhappy.

1279
01:38:33,808 --> 01:38:37,168
But a man must learn to live with her
crash.
