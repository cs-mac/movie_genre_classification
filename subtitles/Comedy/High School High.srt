1
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,600
Mr. Andrews, Mr. Kudo, Mr. Fairchild.

2
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:40,200
Morning.

3
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,700
Mr. Jenson,
didn't see you at the History Club meeting.

4
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:44,600
That was the idea.

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,700
Mr. Edwards, how did the castration go
on that polo pony?

6
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:49,200
You're next, pal.

7
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:51,300
Nice tie, teach. Clip-on?

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,100
- Daddy's boy.
- Bite me!

9
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,200
Wellington Academy. Are you white?

10
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,500
Hold, please. I'll put you right through.

11
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,600
Wellington Academy. Are you white?

12
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:07,600
Hold, please. I'll put you through.

13
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,800
Mr. Clark, your father's waiting for you.

14
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,900
How are you doing, Mr. Clark?
Looking good.

15
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:25,000
- Thank you, Mr. Kuntzler, I'm fine.
- Good.

16
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,800
There he is, the man of the hour.

17
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,100
Son, don't just stand there. Come join us.

18
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,000
For a moment,
I didn't think you were gonna make it.

19
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,700
Father, I really need to talk to you.

20
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:49,400
Plenty of time for that, son.
Sit down. I have something to tell you.

21
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,200
Sit down, Richard, and smoke.

22
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:56,100
- But, Father...
- Now, everyone smokes a pipe here.

23
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,100
I do it. Your grandfather did it.

24
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,900
Even the Indians smoked on this land...

25
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,100
before they traded it away
for some chickens and a pound of jewellery.

26
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,600
- But, Father, I hate...
- Suck.

27
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:10,800
Son, it gives me great pleasure
to announce that we're promoting you...

28
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:14,000
to Assistant Vice Chairman
of the History Department.

29
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,500
Father, that's why we have to talk.

30
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,400
Yes, there's lots to talk about.

31
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,400
You'll need a telephone,
and we'll move you from the basement...

32
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:27,100
Father, for once in your life,
will you just listen to me?

33
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,700
Oh, my.

34
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,400
Look, I've taken a job...

35
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,900
at Barry High School.

36
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:42,600
For the moment, I will assume that you've
found a sense of humour and are joking.

37
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,500
I'm not joking.

38
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,400
Richard, if you do this, you will fail.

39
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,500
You will fail.

40
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:54,000
And mark my words, you'll come crawling
back here with your tail between your legs.

41
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:57,600
You're wrong, Father.
I'm going to succeed at Barry High School.

42
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:02,200
And I have no intention of ever crawling
back here with anything between my legs.

43
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:13,700
Barry High.

44
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:36,600
Hey, could you point me
to the faculty parking lot?

45
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:39,700
Thanks a lot.

46
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,800
Where?

47
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,700
Beautiful morning.

48
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,600
- Come on, give me a break.
- All right.

49
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,100
Man.

50
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:39,000
Hold it. What is this?

51
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:47,000
- No, wait a minute.
- What the heck is this? Get on in there.

52
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,000
Come here.

53
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,600
- You had them last week.
- I know what you mean.

54
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,800
All right, give me $3.

55
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:59,700
My brother, 24 carats, $24.

56
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,900
No, thank you. I already have a...

57
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:12,500
<i>Falique Abdul, please come to the office.</i>
<i>One of your fathers is here.</i>

58
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,300
You watch it, okay. Okay?

59
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:22,100
- Who's that?
- How the hell should I know?

60
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:37,000
Well, what have we got here?
Griff, welcome back, bro.

61
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:39,300
So you finally got what you wanted?

62
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,800
It's a nice little business.
Keeps us in pocket change.

63
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:45,700
I knew it was you that set me up, bro.

64
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:49,300
If it bothers you that much,
go ahead, make your move.

65
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,100
Or did that year in juvie soften your cheese?

66
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:55,500
This is my turf now.
You show me respect. Me.

67
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,000
Paco de la Vega-El Camino-Cordova-Jose
Cuervo- Sanchez-Rodriguez...

68
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,200
Junior.

69
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,100
Are we not forgetting a name?

70
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,600
- What's that?
- Skid mark.

71
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,400
All right, you toughs. Break it up.

72
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,800
Now, cut it out.

73
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:18,000
You boys ought to be ashamed
of yourselves.

74
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:20,300
School is no place for fighting.

75
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,800
What are you looking for?

76
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,400
I'm looking for the rest your posse...

77
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:27,200
that's going to keep me
from ripping you a new asshole.

78
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:30,800
I will pretend for the moment
that you meant that in a nice way.

79
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:33,600
But I am warning you,
I'm about to lose my temper.

80
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,000
Now, I want you boys to shake hands.

81
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,800
Go on.

82
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,300
There. See?

83
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Now, that wasn't so bad, was it?

84
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:52,500
It's always best to shake hands,
unless someone just sneezed into it...

85
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:57,300
or if they have a stump.
That could be a little weird.

86
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,300
All right, now go on, everybody.
Get back to class.

87
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,000
Cross me again, Griffy-boy...

88
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,300
and even Mr. Rogers here
won't be able to save your ass.

89
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,900
- Go on. Bye.
- Let's go, dogs.

90
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:10,000
Gentlemen, I believe classes are this way.

91
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,500
They're not at school here anymore.

92
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:15,300
- Are you in school here?
- Yeah.

93
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,800
- First day?
- No, not really. I was...

94
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,700
Mine, too. I'm a new teacher, Mr. Clark.
What's your name?

95
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:25,900
- Griff McReynolds.
- Nice to meet you, Griff.

96
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:29,600
You know, son,
I remember my first day at school.

97
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,300
Hope you live through this one, chump.

98
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,600
<i>Your attention, please.</i>

99
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:38,900
<i>Today begins sexual awareness week.</i>
<i>Please contact Nurse Johnson in the hall.</i>

100
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,800
Here you go, you little slut.

101
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,300
Excuse me. I'm looking for Room 134.

102
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,900
Thank you.

103
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:50,100
<i>Keep moving. I repeat, keep moving.</i>

104
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,400
<i>Pick up that can.</i>

105
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,400
<i>Where are you going?</i>
<i>The little girls' room is that way.</i>

106
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,800
<i>Hey, take off those colours.</i>

107
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,200
<i>Yeah, you. Lose the cigarette.</i>

108
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,200
<i>Take a hike, Gumby.</i>
<i>Get rid of the sunglasses.</i>

109
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:09,200
Excuse me. But this kind of behaviour...

110
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,400
I'd bet the principal would frown
on this sort of thing.

111
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,500
Evelyn Doyle, Principal.

112
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,700
Look, pinhead, I don't know
what nursery school you come from...

113
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,100
but here you screw up, you die.

114
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:25,100
Every bad kid in the city
is dumped into our laps.

115
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,300
Excuse me, Ms. Doyle, with all due respect...

116
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,700
I don't think there is such a thing
as a bad kid.

117
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:33,400
At least, they don't start off that way.
They just need someone they can relate to...

118
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:37,200
and I can reach them.
I know what's def, what's wack...

119
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,600
what's jam, what's straight-up booty.

120
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:43,100
Mr. Clark,
how long have you been teaching here?

121
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,400
Twenty minutes!

122
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,800
I've been here over 20 years.
Don't you question my authority on this.

123
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,700
Excuse me.

124
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,800
Pardon me.

125
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,200
Are you having a hard time
finding your way around?

126
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,100
Yes. I'm looking...

127
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,300
for Room 134.

128
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:08,400
- Hi. Victoria Chapell.
- Richard Clark.

129
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,600
Nice to meet you, Mr. Clark.
It's down this way.

130
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,600
What do you teach, Ms. Chapell?

131
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:17,800
I'm Principal Doyle's
administrative assistant.

132
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,900
Drama coach. You did say Room 134?

133
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:23,700
Yes.

134
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:29,200
This is it. All of our classrooms
are in dire need of repair.

135
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:33,000
Ever since the legislature passed
that "Three F's and You're Out" law...

136
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,000
a lot of schools have closed.

137
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,900
The school board decided
it just wasn't worth it.

138
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,600
I guess they just gave up on these kids.

139
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,100
So we've been squeezed for money
ever since.

140
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,700
We've been forced to...

141
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,400
Guess I'll get that later.

142
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:57,200
Mr. Clark, are you by any chance related
to Thaddeus Clark...

143
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,900
Headmaster at the Wellington School?

144
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:01,000
Yeah. He's my father.

145
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,600
Every school in the district
uses his book as a faculty primer.

146
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,800
You know,
I don't see the family resemblance.

147
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,600
Most people think I take after my mum.

148
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,800
Look at this place.
Boy, it has great character.

149
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,900
Sure, it needs a little paint and plaster...

150
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,100
and floorboards...

151
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:30,900
and pest control.

152
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:33,000
With a little elbow grease...

153
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,300
Jesus!

154
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:43,800
And some new wiring,
she'll be back to shape in no time.

155
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:47,500
Smell those seats.

156
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:52,500
It says, "Teach me. I want to learn."

157
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,900
- You must think I'm a silly idealist.
- No.

158
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:02,200
I really admire your dedication.

159
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:06,500
Your wife must be very proud of you.

160
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,100
Actually, I'm not married.

161
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,500
I find that surprising.

162
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,100
It's pretty hard to be married,
if you've never had a steady girlfriend.

163
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:21,400
I'm much too busy with work
to think about much else other than work.

164
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,200
That's very admirable.

165
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:30,500
The last time I heard someone talk like that
was old Mr. Riley.

166
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,800
He was head of the History Department
until last semester.

167
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,400
Retired?

168
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:38,300
If you can call
being beaten to death retiring.

169
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,800
Coffee?

170
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,000
The lounge.

171
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:53,000
- I'm going in. Cover me.
- Good luck in Home Ec, Lou.

172
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,800
It's a little early to start drinking,
don't you think?

173
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,300
Who stops?

174
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:10,500
Hi, I'm Richard Clark.
I'm a new history teacher here.

175
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,300
- What department do you teach in?
- I don't know. Something on the third floor.

176
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,900
Richard, I'd like you to meet somebody.

177
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
This is Bernie Raveling,
our athletic director, and...

178
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,300
It's a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Raveling.

179
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,500
- Letting the moustache grow in, I see.
- Richard...

180
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:34,300
From the looks of the stubble,
I'd say it's going to be a beaut.

181
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,200
I had one in college myself.

182
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,800
Richard, that's Ms. Wells,
the girls' gym teacher.

183
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,600
Did I mention how attractive you look,
Ms. Wells?

184
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:49,000
That blue sweat suit really brings out
the colour of your eyes.

185
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,600
You coming on to me, pickle dick?

186
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
No. I'd never dream of it.

187
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,500
- Not good enough for you?
- Well, it's been a real pleasure.

188
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,100
They should really fix the lighting in here.

189
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:12,300
<i>All right, settle down, you people.</i>

190
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,100
<i>Knock it off. Quiet!</i>

191
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,500
<i>I want quiet.</i>

192
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:23,800
<i>It's a new semester.</i>
<i>That means new I.D. Cards...</i>

193
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:27,600
<i>strip searches and fresh fingerprints.</i>

194
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,500
Shut up!

195
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:37,200
<i>As you know, Mr. Arnott...</i>

196
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:40,600
<i>our assistant principal, is still missing.</i>

197
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,200
<i>If you know of his whereabouts,</i>
<i>or if you have him...</i>

198
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,400
<i>contact me immediately.</i>

199
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,800
<i>And also don't forget,</i>
<i>in less than two months...</i>

200
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:53,700
<i>the state will administer</i>
<i>the Academic Proficiency Test.</i>

201
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:59,300
<i>Anyone planning on going to college</i>
<i>is required to take these exams.</i>

202
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:02,700
<i>Don't forget Career Day on Fridays.</i>

203
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:05,800
<i>The United States Marines</i>
<i>and the Michigan Militia...</i>

204
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,500
<i>will have recruiters here on campus.</i>

205
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,700
<i>All right, listen up!</i>

206
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,900
<i>We have a new teacher.</i>

207
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,200
<i>His name is Richard Clark.</i>

208
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,100
<i>It's his first day.</i>

209
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:21,700
<i>Give him at least a week</i>
<i>before you do something terrible to him.</i>

210
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:24,400
<i>Mr. Clark, do you have anything to say?</i>

211
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,200
<i>Now, you all should know...</i>

212
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,000
Actually, yes.

213
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,500
<i>I was asked a while back,</i>
<i>what teaching meant to me.</i>

214
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:40,300
<i>My reward,</i>
<i>is being able to shape and mould...</i>

215
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,700
<i>agile young minds like yours.</i>

216
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,900
<i>Someday you will be the world's leaders.</i>

217
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:52,400
<i>But the important thing is, I see in you...</i>

218
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,900
<i>the future of America.</i>

219
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,000
You suck!

220
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,200
That's enough, miss!

221
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,500
She's the school's librarian.

222
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,600
Jeez, talk about low morale.

223
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:19,000
All right, please settle down.

224
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,400
There. That's more like it.

225
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:33,500
I know.

226
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,400
I'm the enemy.

227
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,600
I'm the "grown-up."

228
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,800
But, darn it, I was a kid once, too.

229
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,300
And I haven't led a choirboy's life.

230
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:48,300
I've got my share of parking tickets.

231
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,700
At a baseball game once...

232
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:55,200
I moved down to the expensive seats.

233
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,000
Yeah. I'm not proud of it.

234
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:02,800
In order to get to know you...

235
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I've devised a little system.

236
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,700
When I call your name...

237
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,600
I would like you to stand up...

238
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,300
and then you tell me a little something
about yourself.

239
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,600
Natalie Thompson.

240
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,300
- Is there a Natalie Thompson here?
- I'm here.

241
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,700
- What's up, girl?
- Why are you late?

242
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:26,000
- Because the bell rang before I got here.
- Well...

243
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:34,700
All right. Before you came in, we were just
talking about sharing personal information.

244
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,300
Perhaps you can tell us something
about yourself.

245
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:40,700
For the last week,
I've had a yeast infection that's extremely...

246
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,500
Not that personal.

247
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,800
Something about what you enjoy doing.

248
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:47,600
I like writing poetry.

249
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,600
A poet. I love poetry.

250
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:54,300
Perhaps you have a nice one
you'd like to share with us.

251
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,600
Okay.

252
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:00,300
Here's one I wrote yesterday.

253
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,400
"Oh, hopelessness

254
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,500
"unrelenting, blood-drenched

255
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:09,900
"intestine-twisting hopelessness

256
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:15,200
"So thick and mucous-like
in a stinking, vomit-filled void

257
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:19,500
"I am but a rancid carcass on the highway

258
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,900
"Road kill for the maggots

259
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:25,600
"Floating in shark-filled bile,
like wildebeest entrails"

260
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:29,000
That's as far as I got.
I would have finished but...

261
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:32,600
I couldn't find anything
to rhyme with "festering drippage."

262
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,600
Well, thank you, Natalie.

263
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,800
Is it Anthony Jefferson?

264
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,800
Anferny.

265
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,600
I beg your pardon?

266
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:47,800
- Anferny.
- Anferny?

267
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:53,100
Anferny, I thought I wrote it down wrong.

268
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:58,100
All right. Tell us a little something
about yourself, Anferny.

269
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:01,100
You know. I like chilling with my boys...

270
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,300
blazing up a fat blunt...

271
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,100
rizzeezing my mizzonkey...

272
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:07,300
hitting skins with my old lady...

273
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:10,400
hanging my ass over the line,
tagging freeway bridges.

274
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:13,800
I'm down with that poetry shit, too.
You want to hear?

275
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,400
- Sure.
- All right.

276
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:20,000
"My benevolence is upset
and so is my pride

277
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,700
"That's why I took my bitch

278
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,200
"for a ride

279
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,000
"I'm down with the bros
and I'm up on my shiznit

280
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:32,400
"because I love it when I'm just laid back
chilling with my bitch"

281
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,600
"Whichever one of them hoes I'm with"

282
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,900
I call it, <i>Love Can Be A Wonderful Thing.</i>

283
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,800
Thank you, Anferny.

284
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:48,500
That was quite romantic.

285
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,800
Julie Rubels. Miss Rubels?

286
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,500
That's Mrs. Rubels.

287
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:57,500
See, right after I got out of prison,
I met Tito...

288
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:00,000
and that's when little Juan and Maria
came along.

289
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:07,200
I certainly hope
you learned a valuable lesson.

290
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,500
Yes.

291
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:12,900
Basically, as far as vasectomies go,
never use the home kit.

292
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,200
Thank you, Julie.

293
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:20,000
Griff McReynolds?

294
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,800
Where's Griff? Griff.

295
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
We had the pleasure
of meeting earlier today.

296
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,900
Hey, Griff, let me ask you something.

297
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Where do you see yourself in, say, 20 years?

298
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,900
Living in your house, homes...

299
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:35,000
with your cracker ass buried
under the front porch.

300
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:47,800
Hi.

301
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,600
Excuse me.

302
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:56,800
Hi.

303
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,600
- How was your first day?
- Not bad. Not bad at all.

304
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:03,000
I think I may be reaching them.

305
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,000
Victoria?

306
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,500
Do you think
you could give me a ride home?

307
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:11,200
I seem to have misplaced my car.

308
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:15,700
Don't worry about it.
All the teachers lose their cars the first day.

309
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,800
Of course I'll give you a ride.

310
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:22,200
That is,
if you promise to help me chaperone...

311
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,100
the Welcome Back dance tonight.

312
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:27,500
Really?

313
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,800
I'd love to.

314
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:32,800
Great.

315
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,000
So I'll meet you out in the parking lot
in five minutes?

316
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,400
Okay.

317
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,900
- Tripping, right?
- Right.

318
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:03,900
All right, peep this out, y'all.
We going to pump it up a little bit like this.

319
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:05,300
Yeah.

320
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:09,600
Listen, I have a record I want you to play.

321
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:13,400
Don't you think the kids would enjoy
a nice song with a melody?

322
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,500
What you got, homes?

323
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:18,800
It is a rare, one-of-a-kind, original pressing.

324
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,100
Yeah? All right, man.
I'm going to put it on here for you.

325
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,400
- Thanks.
- No problem.

326
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,500
Yo, man, these jams be kicking, man.

327
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:52,900
You got any more of this funky fresh shit
lying around the crib?

328
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,500
- Hey.
- Hi.

329
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,100
You're in my history class, right?

330
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:03,700
- I'm Griff McReynolds.
- Natalie Thompson.

331
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:06,600
That was a pretty nice poem
you read in class today, Natalie.

332
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,900
- Thanks.
- How do you think of all that stuff?

333
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:11,100
I try not to, you know?

334
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:14,100
Is it true you used to run the gang
before Paco?

335
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:17,100
Yeah, but I'm through with gangs. Word up.

336
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:20,900
I mean, in juvie I had time to do
some thinking and some reading.

337
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,800
You're different from everybody else here.

338
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,200
Most of the boys I know,
they're all crude and immature.

339
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:30,500
Most of the time,
they just want to stare at girls' breasts.

340
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:33,200
- You know what I mean?
- Sorry. What?

341
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,600
This is my song.

342
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:39,300
- You want to bust one?
- I don't know. We just met.

343
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:42,600
Come on. It's just an innocent little dance.

344
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,300
Okay.

345
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:15,400
Yeah.

346
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,100
All right, boys, let's party.

347
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:34,400
Yo, Mr. DeMarco in the house. Beat it.

348
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:42,000
- Paco.
- What up?

349
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:44,900
What's the 411 on my shipment?

350
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:48,300
Same as always.
Mr. A's Restaurant, Friday nights.

351
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:51,800
You bring the cash. We bring the boot.
You know the drill.

352
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,300
You tell Mr. A to expect me.

353
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,600
I'll do that.

354
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:03,300
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I got to go mingle with my customers.

355
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:05,600
See, real money talks.

356
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,500
Let's see if yours does.

357
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:11,700
I mean, there was a time...

358
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:15,600
when I tried all the self-help groups
like Outward Bound...

359
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:20,100
and that other one where a bunch of men
sit around a campfire naked...

360
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,500
beating drums and abusing themselves.

361
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:27,100
Then I tried drugs.
Prozac, Zantac, Monoxodil.

362
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:29,700
But in the end,
you know what I found worked for me?

363
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,400
Dim sum.

364
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,700
Whenever I'm feeling overwhelmed by life...

365
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,900
I just head to Chinatown.

366
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:40,300
Yo, Mr. Clark, Paco and his boys heading up
in here. You want us to serve them fools?

367
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,600
Look. Anferny, instead of using your fists...

368
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,000
try using this.

369
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,700
Head-butting?

370
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,100
Never mind.
Just pick a window and guard it.

371
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:54,300
Richard,
you're not really going to try and stop...

372
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,300
Paco and his gang from coming in, are you?

373
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,800
- They come to all the dances.
- Not anymore.

374
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,100
What if they got guns and knives
and everything?

375
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:05,000
Who'd bring guns and knives to a dance?

376
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:10,300
In that case,
maybe we'd better call the police.

377
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:14,500
No, wait. The last time they tried that,
four people ended up in the hospital.

378
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:18,300
I can see your point.
We can't have kids going to the hospital.

379
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:21,900
Who said anything about kids?
The cops were beaten senseless.

380
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,900
All right.

381
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,700
You take care of the music. Anferny,
you and your guys, you come with me.

382
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:30,400
Let's go.

383
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,300
Say, nice leather jacket.

384
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,500
- Men's Warehouse?
- Shut up, teach.

385
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:42,200
We're coming in, so stand aside.

386
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:45,900
Not this time, gentlemen.
This dance is for Barry students only.

387
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:49,000
We're not gonna have any gangs
inside our school.

388
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,700
- Who's gonna stop us?
- My gang.

389
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:54,200
We already up inside the school.

390
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,500
You call them bunch of pussies a gang?

391
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:59,700
Look, Paco, if you're interested
in coming back to school...

392
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:01,300
- and working towards a career...
- Shut up!

393
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,700
Are you gonna move aside...

394
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:06,300
or am I gonna have to turn your eyebrows
into a moustache?

395
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:07,800
Paco...

396
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:13,000
- why don't you chill out, man?
- Stay out of this, Griff.

397
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:17,200
- Since when you been down with O.P. P?
- What you tripping about?

398
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:20,500
- You with my girl.
- I am not your girl, Paco.

399
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:23,300
- Since when?
- We went on one date.

400
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,600
If I had known
you were gonna rob that liquor store...

401
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,600
trust me, I never would have gone.

402
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,100
No one got hurt, did they?

403
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,000
Only 'cause the clerk was wearing
a bulletproof turban.

404
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:34,200
All right, that's enough.

405
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:36,700
Fine. I don't want you anyway,
you super freak.

406
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,700
You're a real jack-off, you know that?

407
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,200
That's enough. I mean it.

408
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:47,500
We're all civilised human beings here.

409
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,800
Certainly we can come up
with a compromise.

410
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,800
All right. I just got some fresh wheels.

411
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,000
How about a chickee run?

412
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:58,900
- You're a real idiot, you know?
- That's good. Chickee run.

413
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,800
Isn't that better than fighting?

414
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:03,500
Okay, everybody, let's go. Back to dancing.

415
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:07,600
- And we'll see you in, what?
- Ten minutes. Beck's Bluff.

416
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:10,300
- See you at the Bluff.
- Thanks, pal.

417
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:13,100
Chickee run.

418
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:19,900
See? There's always an intelligent way
to solve our differences.

419
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:23,500
My God, Richard, do you have any idea
what you've just done?

420
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,300
Get lost, punk.

421
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:44,900
All right.

422
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:49,500
First one to jump out of the car
before the edge of the cliff loses.

423
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:53,500
Now remember, no ramming, no swerving...

424
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:56,600
and absolutely no use of brakes at any time.

425
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:59,700
All right, listen up, guys. Here's the deal.

426
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,900
When I drop this scarf...

427
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,400
you boys are gonna go.

428
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,300
No jumping the gun.

429
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:08,900
Ready...

430
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,100
set...

431
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,300
go!

432
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:50,100
Richard, just promise me you'll be careful.

433
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,900
Remember some things are irreplaceable.

434
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:56,400
Irreplaceable?
Nothing's gonna happen to me.

435
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:01,700
I was talking about my car!

436
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:12,400
Hey.

437
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:19,800
Griff. Paco. Listen to me, boys.

438
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:22,200
Going fast never solved anything.

439
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,800
This is no way to resolve a dispute.

440
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,900
We can work this mess out.

441
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:29,300
I want you both to get out of your cars
right now...

442
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:32,100
and we'll settle this in an adult manner...

443
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:34,000
like a fistfight.

444
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,400
There. That's better.

445
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:21,200
Nobody panic.

446
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:23,700
I'm okay.

447
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:27,500
Here's the tip.
Nobody has to know about this.

448
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:30,200
Our little secret.

449
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:45,500
<i>Firefighters from all over</i>
<i>Southern California...</i>

450
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:49,800
<i>are still trying to contain the flames</i>
<i>that have blackened over 200 acres...</i>

451
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:52,400
<i>and caused several blocks of homes</i>
<i>to be evacuated.</i>

452
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:56,300
<i>The charred remains of three cars</i>
<i>were found in the rubble.</i>

453
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:59,800
<i>One, a classic Corvette,</i>
<i>has been described by experts...</i>

454
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,900
<i>as being irreplaceable.</i>

455
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:06,900
I think we've heard enough bad news
for one day.

456
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:09,000
What we've been hearing are rumours...

457
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:12,700
that some of our students
may have been involved in this fire.

458
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,200
And very possibly, a teacher.

459
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:20,400
You wouldn't know anything about that,
would you, Mr. Clark?

460
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:22,500
No.

461
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,500
You know, Clark...

462
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:29,000
I've been thinking
that maybe we got off on the wrong foot.

463
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,900
I happen to be a woman
who has strong opinions...

464
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,900
about how this place should be run.

465
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:38,600
It's just possible
that you and I don't see eye-to-eye...

466
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:41,200
on our philosophies of education.

467
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
I've always been a woman of few words.

468
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:47,600
No miracles.

469
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,300
Dumping ground.

470
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:52,500
I'll need more words than that, ma'am.

471
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,700
All right. I'll spell it out for you.

472
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,600
Our primary job here...

473
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:05,300
is to warehouse these delinquents,
until such time as they can be released...

474
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,700
into the general population...

475
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,900
or sent to a real jail.

476
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:14,800
Look, although I may admire
and even appreciate your ideals...

477
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:17,300
I know what works, Mr. Clark.

478
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,400
I know what to expect from these kids...

479
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,200
and they know what to expect from me.

480
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:28,400
My hope is that you can fit into the pattern
here at Barry.

481
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:31,400
I guess I should get to class.

482
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:34,700
I've certainly enjoyed our chat...

483
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:38,100
and I'll take everything you've said to heart.

484
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,400
Clark!

485
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,000
Mr. Clark...

486
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:47,100
Chickee run, man. Yeah.

487
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:50,500
- Mr. Clark, you were smoking last night.
- Thanks, Anferny.

488
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,800
My man!

489
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:56,800
For you, Mr. Clark.

490
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,300
Richard, you forgot your briefcase.

491
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:02,500
How sweet. Is that for me?

492
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:05,100
Sorry about your car.

493
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:24,900
All right. I want everyone to take their...

494
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,300
seats.

495
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:32,500
Today, I'd like to talk about...

496
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:40,400
All right. I guess I won't need this anymore.

497
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,400
Let's begin, shall we?

498
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:49,800
Yesterday,
I was about to start with the Bill of Rights...

499
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,300
and what they mean to all of us.

500
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:55,800
Who can tell me about the Founding Fathers
and their doctrine?

501
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:15,400
Let me go, man.

502
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:18,000
That's not funny. Let go.

503
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:21,000
<i>Your attention, please.</i>

504
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:24,400
<i>This is Principal Doyle</i>
<i>welcoming you once again...</i>

505
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:27,000
<i>to Barry High's weekly Career Day.</i>

506
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:29,800
<i>All the companies represented here</i>
<i>have been handpicked...</i>

507
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:35,000
<i>by me in order to give you</i>
<i>a full spectrum of safe and legal ways...</i>

508
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:39,300
What's up, man?
I see you got a bright future ahead of you.

509
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:43,600
You wouldn't understand, Paco.
I'm trying to help my family.

510
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:47,200
See now, this is the shit
that's going to feed your family, not some...

511
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,000
rinky-dink job.

512
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,600
Go ahead, man. I'm sure you could use it.

513
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:55,400
I got a big deal going down, all right,
with DeMarco at Mr. A's Restaurant.

514
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:58,300
- You remember the zip code, right?
- Yeah.

515
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,200
I need a good mule.

516
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:03,600
- Are you up for it?
- I can't even think about that right now.

517
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:07,300
Who's asking you to think?
Ask Alonzo here. Thinking hurts.

518
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:18,800
Richard?

519
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,700
Hello?

520
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:52,000
You tell your boyfriend this is only
the beginning. He better back off.

521
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:53,800
Get your hands off of me!

522
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,300
Come on, I know you want this.
I read Mike Tyson's book.

523
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:18,100
Javier, come quick and bring your tools.

524
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:30,000
Don't worry, Victoria, I'm here.

525
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:33,800
Let me handle this.

526
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:40,000
Here, put this on.

527
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:50,200
Animal.

528
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:53,200
Get off of her.

529
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:00,100
Here, sit down.

530
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:50,900
Victoria.

531
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:53,700
No. Stay away from me.

532
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:57,100
- It's okay. It's me.
- I know.

533
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:00,000
What the hell's going on here?

534
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:02,000
I was attacked.

535
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,000
Dressed like that, what do you expect?

536
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:07,000
And alone with him.

537
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:09,100
It wasn't just me. There were three of us.

538
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,600
That makes it all better.

539
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:15,700
No. I was wrestling with the other guy.
He was trying to have sex with her.

540
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,300
I don't care what your arrangement was,
or how it went wrong.

541
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,300
Now you listen to me, Clark.

542
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:24,500
Either you shape up,
or I'll bounce you out of here...

543
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,800
faster than a homo at Fort Dix.

544
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,700
- Does it hurt here?
- A little.

545
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,100
And here?

546
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:45,100
- How about here?
- I can't feel your hand.

547
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:48,400
That's because I'm touching myself.

548
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,300
I better get you something to wear.
You have a T-shirt around here anywhere?

549
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:54,900
Top drawer.

550
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:03,900
Here we are.

551
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:08,600
Poor thing. You must be exhausted.

552
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Let me loosen that bra and get you some air.

553
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,900
Richard...

554
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:19,800
Victoria, I'm sorry about all this.
It's all my fault.

555
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,500
If they think by attacking you
they can scare me off, they're nuts.

556
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:27,300
They can attack you all they want.
I'm gonna get through to these kids.

557
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:30,100
Sure, getting them to come to class,
it's a small victory...

558
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:33,600
- but it isn't enough.
- Richard, they have to want to learn.

559
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:37,100
That's exactly my point.
And I think Griff is the key.

560
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:39,200
He seems to be a leader. Now...

561
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,600
if I could just reach him,
I could get through to the others...

562
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:44,600
You have to be careful.

563
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:47,300
If you raise their expectations...

564
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:50,500
their hopes, and their dreams,
and then you fail?

565
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,600
It's worth the risk.

566
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,600
These are all basically good kids.

567
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:58,100
They deserve the same experiences
that we all had in high school.

568
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:01,500
Dating, going to proms,
and begging for sex.

569
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:04,200
Richard, you have to trust me on this one.

570
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:07,400
I'm your friend.

571
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:11,100
I'm more than a friend.

572
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,700
To me?

573
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:18,200
Yes. Why not?

574
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:24,000
Well, no one who's ever looked like you
has ever looked at me.

575
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:26,900
That's their loss.

576
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:34,400
You know, I have never been very good
at relationships.

577
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:39,600
In fact, most of mine always ended with,
you know:

578
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:43,000
"Hey, what are you doing in bed
with that other woman?"

579
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:46,000
And that was me talking.

580
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,800
Victoria, I do find you very attractive.

581
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,100
What's wrong?

582
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,800
I'm scared.

583
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:06,600
It's okay, you can be on top.

584
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:09,600
No, it isn't that.

585
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:15,800
Trouble just seems to follow me around.

586
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,600
Everywhere I go, there's always someone
looking to bust my balls.

587
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:21,600
Don't worry, Richard.

588
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:24,300
Your balls are safe with me.

589
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,800
My God, you're a virgin.

590
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,200
No, I still have my panties on.

591
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:47,500
- I still can't...
- Richard, I'm over here.

592
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:08,300
Driver, I'm the next stop.

593
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:12,300
Forget it, pal.
We don't stop in this neighbourhood.

594
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:28,100
Griff?

595
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:35,200
- Here you go, darling.
- Thanks, Sam.

596
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:38,200
Watch your back.

597
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:43,500
Here's your cola, Griff.

598
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,800
- Griff.
- Mr. Clark.

599
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:56,500
- What are you doing here?
- I live here.

600
00:44:57,100 --> 00:45:00,600
I realise a lot of these men do,
but you can get help for this, son.

601
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:04,400
No. I mean my mom and I
live in an apartment upstairs.

602
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:09,600
Listen, Griff.
The reason I came here is because l...

603
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:14,200
I sense that you want to make something
of yourself...

604
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:17,400
and if you help me,
we can turn the school around.

605
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:19,800
Why me, man?
You'll have to get somebody else.

606
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,500
Who do you think is watching my little...

607
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:24,300
brothers and sisters
while my moms is working? I'm all they got.

608
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:26,900
You remind me a lot of myself
when I was your age...

609
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:30,200
except I was white and had
both parents and lived in the suburbs...

610
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:33,000
and I didn't have any brothers or sisters.

611
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:36,100
Maybe you remind me of somebody else.

612
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:40,000
Griff, don't you have a dream?

613
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:45,000
- You wouldn't be interested, man.
- Sure I would. Tell me.

614
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:50,700
- Promise you won't tell anyone.
- You have my word.

615
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:57,900
- I want to go to college.
- College? You got to be...

616
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:02,200
I'm sorry. Listen, Griff, I'll make you a deal.

617
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:05,000
You help me get these kids to learn...

618
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:09,400
and I promise you, I will do everything
in my power to get you into college.

619
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:11,800
Don't try to play me, Mr. Clark.

620
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,000
I've been promised stuff before
that hasn't come true.

621
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:18,400
I'm saying, where would I get the money
for college from?

622
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:21,300
- You ever hear of scholarships?
- Yeah!

623
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:22,900
Well...

624
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:26,000
you probably won't get any of those.

625
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:29,100
But there are plenty of other ways.
I promise you.

626
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:30,900
Don't just take my word for it, all right?

627
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:33,200
You go home, you talk it over
with your mother.

628
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:34,700
I'm sure she'll agree with me.

629
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,000
Here.

630
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:42,900
Listen, Griff,
you don't have to live in a community...

631
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:46,400
infested with crimes, and drugs, and gangs.

632
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:51,200
You don't have to end up in some sleazy bar
with a bunch of washed-up bums...

633
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:54,100
watching some over-the-hill stripper
expose herself...

634
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:56,800
for a few measly dollars in her G-string.

635
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,900
Okay. Now, in the next six weeks...

636
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:21,400
I am gonna try and cram as much knowledge
into your brains as is humanly possible.

637
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:26,300
Or as space will allow.

638
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:29,600
Now, this is your textbook for the semester.

639
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
They open like this.

640
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:40,900
Now all of you try it.

641
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:13,500
Good.

642
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:16,600
All right. Let's get to work.

643
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:19,100
Maybe we should start
with some basic English.

644
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:21,500
Now, who can give me a complete sentence?

645
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:25,000
Yo, you wack punk,
you be going down the hard way.

646
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:27,700
All right, that's a good sentence.
Let's examine it.

647
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:31,400
"Yo" is a common colloquial greeting...

648
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:32,800
comma...

649
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:36,500
"you wack punk...

650
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:39,700
"you be going..."

651
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:43,200
This is just bad syntax.
Who can give me another sentence?

652
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:46,700
- Julie.
- I think my water broke.

653
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:48,100
Good.

654
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,500
"I think..."

655
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:03,300
- What's the capital of Nebraska?
- Lincoln.

656
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:05,600
- Right. Who freed the slaves?
- Lincoln.

657
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:08,600
Right. Charles Keating cooked the books
of what S and L?

658
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:10,100
- Lincoln.
- Yes.

659
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:12,600
- Who makes the best town car?
- Cadillac.

660
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:14,800
No.

661
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:18,500
- Lincoln!
- Amazing.

662
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:20,600
Now we're getting somewhere.

663
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:33,200
You and three of your G's
are on someone else's turf.

664
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:36,700
You're cruising along in your fly ride
about 20 miles per.

665
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:40,500
There's a posse of eight homies just sitting
in front of their crib, they're just...

666
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:42,700
chilling on the porch
playing some fresh jams.

667
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:45,700
- Who they got on the box?
- I think they're riffing with Tag Team...

668
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:48,800
maybe some Ice, Snoop, Biggie,
Junior MAFIA, whatever.

669
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:51,600
They decide that they want to throw down.

670
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:55,100
So, you and your boys, you pile out
of your hooptie for the face-off.

671
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:59,400
They have six baseball bats and two chains.

672
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:01,800
You have three brass knuckles...

673
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,900
and two sawed-off pool cues,
you know, jimmy sticks.

674
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:07,900
Now, what I want to know is
what is the ratio...

675
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:10,600
of metal weapons to wooden ones?

676
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:19,400
Over here, over here, Mr. Clark, Julie knows.

677
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:48,100
Okay, pop quiz. Who was the first president
to use the telephone?

678
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:49,600
- Anferny.
- Nixon.

679
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:50,900
No. Griff.

680
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:51,900
- Garfield.
- Yes.

681
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:53,400
First president to be on television?

682
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:54,700
Anferny.

683
00:50:54,900 --> 00:50:57,500
- Johnny Carson.
- No, he was never president. Natalie.

684
00:50:57,700 --> 00:50:59,200
- Eisenhower.
- Yes.

685
00:50:59,300 --> 00:51:02,300
Who was the last president to blow chunks
on a Japanese head of state?

686
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:03,700
Anferny.

687
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:05,100
- Bush?
- Yes!

688
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:15,200
Good day, Ms. Doyle.

689
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:22,200
Good morning, Ms. Doyle.

690
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:28,600
You looking fine, Ms. Doyle.

691
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:53,000
Mr. Arnott? Where have you been?

692
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:55,700
They released me.

693
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:02,700
Everyone...

694
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:07,000
state law prohibits Mr. Clark
from being here today, so he's at home...

695
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:10,900
probably a little nervous,
but I'm sure rooting for all of you.

696
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:12,600
All right, here we go.

697
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:15,400
The Academic Proficiency Test.

698
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:19,800
You have eight hours in which to complete
this exam. Good luck to all of you.

699
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:22,500
Begin work now.

700
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:33,500
<i>Every day people are discovering</i>
<i>just how fun and easy it is...</i>

701
00:52:33,700 --> 00:52:36,500
<i>to get a precision-layered haircut</i>
<i>with the incredible...</i>

702
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:39,000
<i>Flowbee Precision Haircutting System.</i>

703
00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:41,000
<i>Don't be fooled by imitators.</i>

704
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:51,500
<i>Flowbee cuts from</i>
<i>a half-inch to six inches long.</i>

705
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:04,900
<i>Can't do it wrong.</i>
<i>Get a close-up on this. Squeeze.</i>

706
00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:07,200
<i>Go ahead. Show your abs.</i>

707
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:28,300
Shit.

708
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
All right, time's up.

709
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:56,200
Come on. Time's up. Close your booklets.

710
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:59,000
I'm sure you all did very well.

711
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:01,900
Scores will be posted
at the end of this week.

712
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:10,200
How do you think you did on the test?

713
00:54:10,300 --> 00:54:13,900
I don't know. For the first time in my life,
I feel like I did something right.

714
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,100
Me, too.

715
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:17,600
- Check this out.
- What is it?

716
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:20,900
It's my future. Remember that college
I was telling you about?

717
00:54:21,100 --> 00:54:23,000
- Yeah.
- They wrote me back yesterday.

718
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:26,200
- Yeah.
- Now I feel like I got a real chance to get in.

719
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,300
Guess I owe a lot to Mr. Clark?

720
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:32,700
Yeah, you know, I think all the kids
pretty much feel the same way.

721
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:34,600
I mean, think about it.

722
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:37,800
We could both end up
at the same school together.

723
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:41,800
Griff, this is the happiest
I ever remember being.

724
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:45,400
It's the first time in my life I haven't prayed
for a gas line to rupture...

725
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:47,700
under my building while I was smoking.

726
00:54:47,900 --> 00:54:50,700
Natalie, I'm glad you're happy.

727
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:53,900
Come on.
There's something I want you to see.

728
00:54:54,100 --> 00:54:55,100
Okay.

729
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:58,300
Mr. Clark has taken this place on
as a special project.

730
00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:01,500
"Fie, my lord, fie!

731
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:05,300
"Out, damned spot. Out, I say."

732
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:07,800
Line!

733
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:10,200
"Who would have thought the old man
to have so much blood?"

734
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:14,100
"Who would have thought the old man
to have so much blood in him?"

735
00:55:19,700 --> 00:55:21,500
Take it off!

736
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:29,900
Hustle up, man. Come on, hurry up.

737
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:33,900
Yeah, sweet.

738
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:38,300
This ought to take care of our little problem.

739
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:40,300
Let's get out of here, Paco.

740
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:52,400
Hey, give it a rest.

741
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:56,500
Everyone, I just want to say
before the test scores arrive...

742
00:55:57,500 --> 00:56:01,400
that I am so proud of all of you.

743
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:10,900
Well?

744
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:14,600
As I expected,
every student in this class failed.

745
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:18,600
The lowest scores in the country.

746
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:23,000
- But there must be some mistake.
- That's right.

747
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:27,300
And you're it. See for yourself.
Figures don't lie.

748
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:31,100
We're not dealing
with Rhodes scholars here.

749
00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:35,200
It's time I just accepted what I am
and get on with my life.

750
00:56:37,100 --> 00:56:38,500
No, Griff, wait.

751
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:41,300
See what you've done?

752
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:46,000
I told you to leave them at the bottom
of the barrel, where they belong.

753
00:56:46,300 --> 00:56:47,500
Griff, wait.

754
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,900
Consider yourself terminated
as of right now.

755
00:56:52,100 --> 00:56:53,400
Natalie, wait.

756
00:56:53,900 --> 00:56:55,600
Chuckie, wait.

757
00:56:57,400 --> 00:57:00,400
Wait, Ms. Doyle,
you're making a huge mistake.

758
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:03,500
Mr. Clark has helped this school.
He's a good teacher.

759
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:06,800
And I'm not just saying that
because we slept together.

760
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:11,800
Clean out your desk by the end of the day.

761
00:57:24,300 --> 00:57:26,400
- Richard, wait.
- No.

762
00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:28,900
You were right all along.

763
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:32,600
I didn't know what I was getting into
with these kids.

764
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:35,600
Richard.

765
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:40,500
I'm out of here.

766
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:43,400
What's wrong with all of you?

767
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:46,500
Have you forgotten
how much Mr. Clark has helped us?

768
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:50,200
You had a D average
before Mr. Clark started tutoring you.

769
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:52,700
Now you're on the honour roll.

770
00:57:52,900 --> 00:57:56,500
And this boy. Everyone thought he had
Tourette's syndrome until Mr. Clark...

771
00:57:56,700 --> 00:57:59,200
discovered he was
a Hindu exchange student.

772
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:21,800
You suck!

773
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:27,800
You can come back.
Look at me. I'm living proof.

774
00:58:30,100 --> 00:58:32,200
Call me.

775
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,300
Richard, wait!

776
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:38,000
Richard.

777
00:58:49,100 --> 00:58:51,300
I'm telling you,
I'm really worried about Richard.

778
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:53,600
I've been calling his house
for the past three days...

779
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:55,100
and I keep getting the same message:

780
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:57,800
"Hi. I'm not here, and I may never be again."

781
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,100
Julie?

782
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:03,100
Buddy up with a mangy dog
or a small child.

783
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:05,800
Hey, Nat, are you okay?

784
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:10,200
- I'm afraid Griff's gonna join Paco's gang.
- Come on.

785
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:11,900
Check this out.

786
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:16,200
Word on the street is Paco and his little
punk dogs slipped those mentals we took.

787
00:59:17,700 --> 00:59:21,400
What I'm saying is, they switched the tests.
That's why everybody flunked.

788
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:24,700
You know, you guys.
I probably didn't need no help.

789
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:28,600
- Oh, my God, this is awful.
- Then we just got to find Mr. Clark.

790
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:32,200
Yeah, but where?
Where do you find a man that depressed?

791
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:35,400
Wait a minute. Dim sum.

792
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:37,900
Chinatown. Come on.

793
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:45,900
Okay, this is it. Julie, Natalie...

794
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:49,000
- why don't you two head down that way?
- Okay.

795
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:52,200
Anferny, go down to the south end
of the block, and I'll go down this way.

796
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:53,700
All right.

797
00:59:57,600 --> 00:59:59,400
Please, let this be the one.

798
01:00:24,100 --> 01:00:26,400
Richard,
what are you trying to do to yourself?

799
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:29,300
Richard, snap out of it.
Don't you recognise me?

800
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:31,100
Mum?

801
01:00:31,700 --> 01:00:33,500
No, it's me.

802
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:40,100
Father O' Flannery?

803
01:00:51,900 --> 01:00:53,300
Mister?

804
01:00:54,300 --> 01:00:57,400
You okay? Mister, you okay?

805
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:01,700
This girl over there, she asked about you.
Come. Now.

806
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:04,500
- Richard, thank God.
- Victoria?

807
01:01:04,700 --> 01:01:08,000
I've been looking everywhere for you.
I didn't know you drank.

808
01:01:08,900 --> 01:01:10,100
I drank?

809
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,200
I thought it was just my pet gorilla here.

810
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:16,400
How many fingers?

811
01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:22,900
Come on, Mr. Clark, snap out of it.
We got to get Griff out of that drug deal.

812
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:26,300
Maybe we should just
let the cops handle this.

813
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:30,300
That would be fine if I didn't mind waiting
20 years to see Griff again.

814
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:33,000
Don't worry. I'll just go in and get him.

815
01:01:33,100 --> 01:01:35,300
Mr. Clark, you can't just go in there
and be like:

816
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:40,500
"Okay, Griff, we're going home,"
else you gonna be going home in a box.

817
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:42,800
The only way we're going to get Griff
out of there...

818
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,300
is you got to show up in the back room
with the cash.

819
01:01:45,500 --> 01:01:47,500
You got the cash, you the man.

820
01:01:47,700 --> 01:01:51,100
- Where am I gonna get the cash?
- Man, DeMarco gonna be there.

821
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:54,200
What you think he carry in his briefcase?
Food stamps?

822
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:57,700
Your job is to make his cash your cash.

823
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:08,500
- Did you get it?
- It's all in there.

824
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:13,500
Good.

825
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:16,200
We just got time to eat.

826
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:21,400
All right, everybody, wait here.

827
01:02:23,500 --> 01:02:26,600
- I'll handle this.
- You not out in 20 minutes...

828
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:29,300
me and my G's is coming in after you,
straight up.

829
01:02:30,500 --> 01:02:33,300
Go in there and represent, Mr. Clark.
You can do it.

830
01:02:34,900 --> 01:02:36,100
I can do this.

831
01:02:39,900 --> 01:02:42,300
- What are you doing here?
- I'm here to help you.

832
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:45,300
Richard, if anything happens,
I want to be here with you.

833
01:02:46,100 --> 01:02:47,300
Thanks.

834
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:52,200
How are we gonna know
which one is DeMarco?

835
01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:56,000
- We'll just take a wild guess.
- Where?

836
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:58,000
Come on.

837
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:07,300
<i>- Someday you will be the world's leaders.</i>
<i>- You suck!</i>

838
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:12,100
Where you going?

839
01:03:13,400 --> 01:03:15,500
It's a mistake, man. I can't do this.

840
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,200
I thought we settled this, Griffy-boy.

841
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:23,600
You better decide right now. You in or out?

842
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:26,900
- I ain't asking again.
- Define "in or out."

843
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:31,300
In, you're with us, and out, you're dead.

844
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:34,300
Works for me.

845
01:03:43,100 --> 01:03:44,700
Where the hell's our waiter?

846
01:03:45,300 --> 01:03:46,900
Good evening, gentlemen...

847
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:50,400
and welcome to Mr. A's
fine dining establishment.

848
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:55,800
I'm Zack. I'll be your waiter this evening,
and this is my trainee, Paula.

849
01:03:56,600 --> 01:03:59,600
I'm an Aries.
I enjoy water sports and dancing.

850
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:02,200
- And my hobbies are origami...
- Enough small talk.

851
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:04,300
Just bring us two thick T-bones.

852
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:06,400
Yes, sir.

853
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:10,100
Would you like those
with or without the bones?

854
01:04:12,700 --> 01:04:15,600
And a couple of glasses of water.

855
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:18,800
All right.
Let me tell you about our water then.

856
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,800
It comes from the Los Angeles aqueduct...

857
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:25,000
where it flows down
a lovely cement channel on a bed of...

858
01:04:25,300 --> 01:04:29,200
I don't care where it came from.
Just bring it to us.

859
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:31,100
I'll take that. It's his birthday.

860
01:04:31,300 --> 01:04:33,600
Would anyone care
for some desserts this evening?

861
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:36,900
Look, you little weasel.
Just bring us what we asked for.

862
01:04:37,300 --> 01:04:40,600
Unless you want me to stick
this bread stick up your ass.

863
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:42,700
It sure would taste better if you didn't.

864
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:46,600
You might want to try buttering it first.

865
01:05:00,900 --> 01:05:02,000
Hey, stand back.

866
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:05,000
Come on. We've got to change disguises.

867
01:05:15,500 --> 01:05:16,900
You ready?

868
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:21,700
Yeah, but unfortunately
we've got this other thing we gotta do first.

869
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:24,300
Let's see what's in this thing.

870
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:25,800
Jesus!

871
01:05:26,600 --> 01:05:27,700
Hurry.

872
01:05:29,900 --> 01:05:32,800
Manny, zap that sauce for me, will you?

873
01:05:33,500 --> 01:05:35,000
Got it.

874
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:47,600
Now, what do you want?

875
01:05:50,700 --> 01:05:53,000
I'm here to see Mr. A.

876
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:54,700
Who the hell are you?

877
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:58,500
I'm Mr. B.

878
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:04,600
Mr. D couldn't make it. He's out with Mr. C.

879
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:09,200
You're early.

880
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:25,700
DeMarco's early.

881
01:06:25,900 --> 01:06:28,300
Say what? You?

882
01:06:30,100 --> 01:06:33,000
Mr. Clark, Miss Chapell,
what are you doing here?

883
01:06:33,700 --> 01:06:36,100
No need to be so formal, boys.

884
01:06:36,900 --> 01:06:38,700
We're not in school anymore.

885
01:06:38,900 --> 01:06:42,600
Two seconds you gonna be
one dead teacher. How's that for formal?

886
01:06:43,300 --> 01:06:46,100
Now, we work for DeMarco,
buying and selling drugs.

887
01:06:46,300 --> 01:06:49,000
We're lowlife scumbags. Just like you.

888
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:53,200
- What are you talking about?
- What better cover than...

889
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:55,200
a teacher and a secretary?

890
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:57,500
Administrative assistant.

891
01:06:58,600 --> 01:07:00,100
Yes, all right.

892
01:07:00,500 --> 01:07:04,700
All right, enough of this small talk.
I've got business with Mr. A. Where is he?

893
01:07:05,100 --> 01:07:06,300
I'm right here.

894
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,200
- Clark?
- Ms. Doyle?

895
01:07:12,900 --> 01:07:15,100
Around here they call me Mr. A.

896
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:16,700
Mister?

897
01:07:16,900 --> 01:07:19,500
I inherited the business
from my late husband.

898
01:07:20,100 --> 01:07:22,500
- I'm shocked.
- What?

899
01:07:22,900 --> 01:07:25,200
That a woman can run a business?

900
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:27,600
No. That you were ever married.

901
01:07:29,300 --> 01:07:32,700
All right. Let's do it.

902
01:07:33,500 --> 01:07:36,000
What exactly is she doing here?

903
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:38,600
She's my bitch.

904
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,300
Well, my significant other.

905
01:07:46,700 --> 01:07:49,500
We've been slapping skins
for quite some time now.

906
01:07:51,100 --> 01:07:54,400
You say you work for DeMarco.
Why should I believe you?

907
01:07:54,600 --> 01:07:57,600
Why would I have his briefcase
unless I was working for him?

908
01:07:57,900 --> 01:07:59,700
That doesn't prove anything.

909
01:08:00,300 --> 01:08:02,600
You could have seen him
down in the restaurant...

910
01:08:02,800 --> 01:08:06,100
dressed up like a waiter,
created some kind of diversion...

911
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:08,900
while she snatched it from under the table.

912
01:08:10,100 --> 01:08:12,700
That's a little far-fetched, don't you think?

913
01:08:12,900 --> 01:08:16,800
Wait a minute. Think about it.
You think he's capable of all that?

914
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:20,200
Hey, all right.

915
01:08:20,300 --> 01:08:22,200
What's the big idea?

916
01:08:22,500 --> 01:08:25,600
- You work out?
- All right. Knock it off.

917
01:08:27,300 --> 01:08:32,000
I say we off him now,
and then do what we want with their bodies.

918
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:34,700
Easy, Paco, easy.

919
01:08:35,500 --> 01:08:38,500
So, you like getting high, Clark?

920
01:08:39,900 --> 01:08:41,200
Who doesn't?

921
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:44,800
Then perhaps you'd like to sample
the finest crank in town.

922
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:49,700
Sure. Load me up a spike.
Let's get this party into gear.

923
01:08:52,300 --> 01:08:56,000
- Look man, he's clean. No tracks.
- I take mine in the ass.

924
01:09:01,500 --> 01:09:04,400
Got used to it as a kid. Shots.

925
01:09:06,100 --> 01:09:08,100
You're starting to piss me off, man.

926
01:09:08,300 --> 01:09:11,000
Maybe you don't have enough holes
in your head already.

927
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:14,500
Excuse me.
Something seems to be riding up here.

928
01:09:17,700 --> 01:09:19,200
What's going on there?

929
01:09:19,300 --> 01:09:21,900
Nothing I know rides up that high.

930
01:09:22,900 --> 01:09:24,100
Here.

931
01:09:25,900 --> 01:09:27,100
Tie off.

932
01:09:36,500 --> 01:09:39,400
You really should have someone
look at that. It could be malignant.

933
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:42,600
Quit stalling.
We don't want to be here all night.

934
01:09:43,900 --> 01:09:46,000
Here's looking at you, kid.

935
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:06,200
This shit be kicking.

936
01:10:07,300 --> 01:10:10,800
Man, I'm wasted off my ass
and you're still ugly.

937
01:10:24,900 --> 01:10:26,100
False alarm.

938
01:10:27,500 --> 01:10:29,700
Some idiot put a gun in the microwave.

939
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:32,400
Good stuff?

940
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:36,500
So what have you got to say for yourself?

941
01:10:36,700 --> 01:10:38,100
Nothing, really.

942
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:42,500
Except it's going to be an interesting
morning tomorrow, after my coffee.

943
01:10:43,700 --> 01:10:45,800
I'll need at least two magazines.

944
01:10:48,600 --> 01:10:51,600
- So it's all here?
- As far as you know.

945
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
- Half a million?
- Really?

946
01:10:54,900 --> 01:10:56,600
Yes, down to the penny.

947
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:00,200
Now, I'll just take my stuff
and be on my way.

948
01:11:01,500 --> 01:11:02,600
Wait here.

949
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:18,600
Griff, you got to get out of here.

950
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:21,700
You're throwing your life away,
messing around with these drug dealers.

951
01:11:21,900 --> 01:11:24,400
- Look who's talking.
- No, he's not a real drug dealer.

952
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:27,000
He's just pretending. He's here to save you.

953
01:11:27,800 --> 01:11:31,100
- You risked your life to come here for me?
- Yeah, of course I did.

954
01:11:31,300 --> 01:11:33,300
Well, not the risking-my-life part.

955
01:11:33,500 --> 01:11:38,100
Anyway, look, Paco switched the tests, and
the police are probably already on their way.

956
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:40,100
We got to get out before...

957
01:11:42,200 --> 01:11:46,300
- It's the waiter and his trainee.
- Yeah. Where the hell's our dinner?

958
01:11:46,500 --> 01:11:50,300
You jughead.
They're the ones who stole our briefcase.

959
01:11:50,700 --> 01:11:52,700
DeMarco, what's going on?

960
01:11:52,900 --> 01:11:55,400
Is this your idea of a straight deal?

961
01:11:57,200 --> 01:12:01,400
- We thought Clark was your guy.
- I never seen him before tonight.

962
01:12:06,900 --> 01:12:10,100
Hey. Another one of these,
one of us is gonna have an orgasm.

963
01:12:10,300 --> 01:12:14,600
Clark, you never should have messed
with me. I don't want him found.

964
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:16,500
No problem.

965
01:12:27,700 --> 01:12:28,800
No.

966
01:12:29,700 --> 01:12:33,000
- Come on, G's. They're down this way.
- You guys.

967
01:12:33,300 --> 01:12:34,500
In the house.

968
01:12:41,500 --> 01:12:44,300
Doyle is getting away. Stop her.

969
01:12:47,300 --> 01:12:49,600
Seems to me
we've got some unfinished business.

970
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:51,900
You're forgetting a couple things,
aren't you?

971
01:12:52,100 --> 01:12:55,900
- Yeah, what's that?
- Richard's not here to help you this time.

972
01:12:56,200 --> 01:12:57,500
And?

973
01:12:57,700 --> 01:12:59,600
I have a frozen pig's foot.

974
01:13:48,500 --> 01:13:49,800
What's he doing?

975
01:13:53,100 --> 01:13:54,800
What's going on?

976
01:13:55,300 --> 01:13:56,600
Come on!

977
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:01,000
Look! There's a bigger man,
and he's got a gun!

978
01:14:29,300 --> 01:14:31,300
- Christ!
- Sorry.

979
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:37,400
This was a new suit, pickle dick.

980
01:14:47,900 --> 01:14:49,400
Get back.

981
01:14:50,600 --> 01:14:54,400
What are you fossils staring at?
Eat your vegetables.

982
01:15:04,300 --> 01:15:08,900
Get back! I'm gonna walk out of here.
You punks get out of the way.

983
01:15:09,700 --> 01:15:13,500
I'm gonna count to three, and if you're
not moving, I'm gonna start shooting.

984
01:15:13,700 --> 01:15:15,200
Do what she says, kids.

985
01:15:15,400 --> 01:15:18,600
Chill, Mr. Clark.
She ain't shooting nothing but the breeze.

986
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:22,200
You kids are even bigger boneheads
than I thought.

987
01:15:22,500 --> 01:15:25,500
And everybody knows it, too,
except for this fool.

988
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,900
You know, Ms. Doyle, that's just what you...

989
01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:31,900
and people like you,
want everyone to think, isn't it?

990
01:15:32,100 --> 01:15:35,600
That somehow, no matter what goes down,
we just can't cut it.

991
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:38,800
You use that as an excuse to hold us back...

992
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:43,200
but Mr. Clark showed us
that there is another way.

993
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:45,400
Another way to flunk.

994
01:15:45,500 --> 01:15:48,300
Think we failed that test? Listen up.

995
01:15:48,600 --> 01:15:52,900
If x is 17, plus the square root of 4,
minus 6...

996
01:15:53,400 --> 01:15:54,500
what's x?

997
01:15:54,900 --> 01:15:56,100
Thirteen.

998
01:15:56,700 --> 01:15:59,700
Famous Russian author of
<i>The Brothers Karamazov?</i>

999
01:15:59,900 --> 01:16:01,300
Who is Dostoyevsky.

1000
01:16:01,500 --> 01:16:04,100
The Gadsden Purchase formed parts
of what two states?

1001
01:16:04,300 --> 01:16:06,300
Arizona and New Mexico.

1002
01:16:06,500 --> 01:16:07,900
All right, I'll shoot him.

1003
01:16:08,100 --> 01:16:10,100
- What's the capital of Ecuador?
- Quito!

1004
01:16:10,200 --> 01:16:11,500
Back off! I mean it.

1005
01:16:11,700 --> 01:16:15,000
- NASA's Apollo Program ended what year?
- 1975!

1006
01:16:15,200 --> 01:16:16,200
Stay away from me.

1007
01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:18,800
Who was responsible
for the first moonwalk?

1008
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:20,300
Michael Jackson!

1009
01:16:22,100 --> 01:16:23,600
What did he say?

1010
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:28,800
No, I'm just playing, man.
It was Louis Armstrong's brother, Neil.

1011
01:16:29,300 --> 01:16:30,300
What group...

1012
01:16:30,500 --> 01:16:34,400
is responsible for the consumption
of the most doughnuts in Los Angeles?

1013
01:16:34,600 --> 01:16:35,700
- Police!
- Right.

1014
01:16:35,900 --> 01:16:37,800
Nobody move. Get your hands up.

1015
01:16:38,500 --> 01:16:40,200
This isn't what it looks like.

1016
01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:42,000
Say hello to Mr. A.

1017
01:16:42,200 --> 01:16:45,000
So this is Mr. A.
We've been looking for him for years.

1018
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:46,700
You're under arrest, fellow.

1019
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:49,800
Hey, partner, there's about five more
gangster-pops in the freezer.

1020
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:53,100
It was her, man.
She masterminded the whole thing.

1021
01:16:53,300 --> 01:16:56,400
- I'll testify in court. She's Mr. A.
- We know.

1022
01:16:57,600 --> 01:17:00,000
Could I borrow your coat?
I can't feel my legs.

1023
01:17:00,200 --> 01:17:02,800
Come on, let me go, man.
I'll give you $50,000.

1024
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:06,300
Ms. Doyle,
I guess we just got off on the wrong foot.

1025
01:17:06,700 --> 01:17:08,100
No hard feelings.

1026
01:17:10,300 --> 01:17:11,700
Wonderbra?

1027
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:16,700
I swear to God, Clark,
when I get out, I'm gonna hunt you down...

1028
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:18,900
and beat you like a circus monkey.

1029
01:17:19,100 --> 01:17:21,000
By the way, happy birthday.

1030
01:17:38,600 --> 01:17:40,800
This shit be kicking.

1031

<i>Will the graduates please rise and begin...</i>

1034
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:55,100
Richard, I never thought I'd say this...

1035
01:17:55,800 --> 01:17:58,100
but I was wrong about you, son.

1036
01:17:58,300 --> 01:18:00,600
I can't believe
what you've accomplished here.

1037
01:18:03,300 --> 01:18:04,700
Thanks, Dad.

1038

01:18:58,300 --> 01:19:00,400
Way to go, Griff! That's my boy!

1048

That's my boy.
