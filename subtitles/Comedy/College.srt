On the sunkist slopes of the Pacific,

California.

00:01:22,054 --> 00:01:31,404
High School Graduation Day, where the next
step is either go to college or go to work.

6
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:41,633
A few drops of rain
couldn't dampen a mother's -

7
00:01:41,645 --> 00:01:45,710
- enthusiasm on her
son's Graduation Day.

Mary Haynes - winner of
every popularity contest -

10
00:02:24,363 --> 00:02:28,013
- in which the boys
were allowed to vote.

12
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:53,358
Jeff Brown -
Star athlete, who believed so much -

13
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:57,820
- in exercise that he made
many a girl walk home.

14
00:03:11,754 --> 00:03:20,494
"I didn't think you would call for me in
the rain. I'm sorry you are all wet."

15
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:04,261
"Young man, it's time you graduated.
You've been here seven years."

16
00:05:30,886 --> 00:05:38,956
"I know you are going to be as popular
at Clayton College as you were here."

17
00:05:55,109 --> 00:06:01,209
"It is my pleasure to present this
diploma to our most brilliant scholar."

18
00:06:25,135 --> 00:06:29,205
"- and your scholastic record
richly merits this honor medal."

19
00:06:40,198 --> 00:06:44,398
"Ronald will now speak on
the 'Curse of Athletics'."

20
00:06:48,244 --> 00:06:54,194
"The secret of getting a medal like
mine is - - books not sports."

21
00:07:10,865 --> 00:07:14,153
"The student who wastes
his time on athletics -

22
00:07:14,165 --> 00:07:17,465
- rather than study shows
only ignorance."

23
00:07:36,504 --> 00:07:40,267
"Future generations depend
upon brains and not -

24
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:44,054
- upon jumping the discus
or hurdling the javelin."

25
00:08:06,404 --> 00:08:11,404
"What have Ty Ruth or Babe
Dempsey done for Science?"

26
00:08:47,466 --> 00:08:50,506
"Where would I be without my books?"

27
00:10:22,672 --> 00:10:26,135
"Your speech was ridiculous.
Anyone prefers -

28
00:10:26,147 --> 00:10:29,622
- an athlete to a weak-knee'd,
teachers' pet."

29
00:10:33,094 --> 00:10:40,084
"When you change your mind about athletics,
then I'll change my mind about you."

30
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:06,527
"Mary is going to enter Clayton ...
I wish I could go."

31
00:11:10,244 --> 00:11:13,524
"I'm afraid we can't afford it, dear."

32
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:20,223
"I can work my way through. Other boys do."

33
00:11:32,182 --> 00:11:40,352
So the following term, Ronald arrived
at Clayton, and was met by ...

34
00:11:46,764 --> 00:11:48,464
Clayton

35
00:12:01,785 --> 00:12:03,845
BOY WANTED

36
00:12:14,764 --> 00:12:19,014
"I need another clerk as good as he is."

37
00:12:50,033 --> 00:12:52,303
"You can commence tomorrow."

38
00:13:14,829 --> 00:13:18,329
"Well, if it isn't the student prince."

39
00:13:48,372 --> 00:13:49,672

00:13:56,302 --> 00:13:57,752
DON'T SPIT

42
00:14:31,725 --> 00:14:35,405
How to play Baseball

43
00:14:36,045 --> 00:14:38,045
How to play Football

44
00:14:39,321 --> 00:14:40,991
How to Sprint

45
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:59,655
"I am Dean Edwards. Your principal writes
me what an excellent student you are."

46
00:15:04,039 --> 00:15:08,127
"A boy like you can make
this athlete-infested college -

47
00:15:08,139 --> 00:15:12,239
- a seat of learning once more."

48
00:15:24,988 --> 00:15:31,028
"You boys will do well to follow the
example of this young scholar."

49
00:15:54,522 --> 00:16:00,292
Sunday found Ronald taking
"fizzical" exercise.

50
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:29,888
BOY WANTED

51
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:39,380
"You play third base for the second team."

52
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:23,250
"You forced two men out
and you're out too."

53
00:27:37,482 --> 00:27:42,212
WANTED
Colored Waiter

54
00:27:59,272 --> 00:28:03,902
"Bring me something you
can't stick your thumb in."

55
00:30:41,696 --> 00:30:48,196
Clayton's wonder track team training
for the intercollegiate meet.

56
00:36:14,814 --> 00:36:18,414
"I admire his spirit.
At least, he's trying."

57
00:36:22,491 --> 00:36:26,224
"Don't get too interested
in that campus clown. -

58
00:36:26,236 --> 00:36:29,981
- You're supposed
to be going with me."

59
00:36:33,051 --> 00:36:36,851
"You take an awful lot for granted."

60
00:38:07,344 --> 00:38:11,004
"Attaboy, you made a hole in one."

61
00:42:36,508 --> 00:42:41,958
A call to the Dean's office
meant only one thing -

62
00:42:42,019 --> 00:42:44,979
GRIEF

63
00:42:58,198 --> 00:43:06,508
"You have been a miserable failure in all
your studies and I know the reason why."

64
00:43:18,387 --> 00:43:24,583
"I took up athletics because the
girl I love thinks I'm a weakling."

65
00:43:28,121 --> 00:43:32,801
"I love her and would do
anything to please her."

66
00:43:36,336 --> 00:43:41,169
"I understand, my boy. The
same thing happened to me, -

67
00:43:41,181 --> 00:43:46,026
- but I was stubborn.
That's why I'm a bachelor."

68
00:43:55,639 --> 00:44:01,319
"Here's a list of the men
eligible for the rowing crew."

69
00:44:09,451 --> 00:44:16,401
"Coach, I'd like to have you make
this young man coxswain of the crew."

70
00:44:24,259 --> 00:44:29,119
"His size and weight are
perfect and he has brains."

71
00:44:38,838 --> 00:44:41,068
"My request is final."

72
00:45:25,908 --> 00:45:32,148
"Clayton can't lose the boat race now.
I've just been appointed the 'Coaxer'."

73
00:46:00,755 --> 00:46:03,848
"Boys, get out the smelling salts - -

74
00:46:03,860 --> 00:46:06,965
- Little Lord Fauntleroy is
your new coxswain."

75
00:46:19,939 --> 00:46:24,859
"It's the Dean's orders. He'll
be in that race unless -"

76
00:46:27,634 --> 00:46:31,284
"- unless something
happens to the poor boy."

77
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:17,058
The day of the race.

78
00:47:26,222 --> 00:47:29,832
"Hey, coach - nothing has
happened to Mama's boy!"

79
00:47:46,976 --> 00:47:51,229
"Don't worry - you're coxswain.
Give him this and -

80
00:47:51,241 --> 00:47:55,506
- he'll wake up just in time
for the football season."

81
00:48:57,932 --> 00:49:05,422
"Please leave! If you were seen in my
room it would mean expulsion for me!"

82
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:13,543
"That's just what I want. I
was expelled this morning -

83
00:49:13,555 --> 00:49:18,710
- and thought I would like
to take you with me."

84
00:49:33,669 --> 00:49:38,192
"I'm going to stay here
until we are discovered - -

85
00:49:38,204 --> 00:49:42,739
- then you might change your
mind about marrying me."

86
00:50:08,064 --> 00:50:12,457
"Boys, we've got to win!
If we don't, rowing -

87
00:50:12,469 --> 00:50:16,874
- will be a thing of the
past at Clayton!"

88
00:50:22,584 --> 00:50:25,194
"Is Ronald our coxswain to-day?"

89
00:50:29,856 --> 00:50:36,106
"Certainly not. I've taken care
of that pest in a big way."

90
00:50:55,696 --> 00:51:02,006
The rival crew, ready for their
most important race of the year.

91
00:51:12,888 --> 00:51:15,198
THE BULLET

92
00:51:39,396 --> 00:51:45,546
"Go on, they are waiting for you.
They've just been kidding me."

93
00:52:47,094 --> 00:52:51,254
"Maybe it's halitosis -
Four out of five have it."

94
00:52:55,665 --> 00:52:58,365
OFFICIAL

95
00:54:11,586 --> 00:54:14,286
DAMFINO

96
00:54:47,212 --> 00:54:50,852
"Go get a boat with a strong bottom."

97
00:55:17,267 --> 00:55:19,667
OLD IRON BOTTOM

98
00:55:48,721 --> 00:55:50,521
"Ready all!"

99
01:01:18,106 --> 01:01:21,286
"Hurry - Jeff has me locked
here in my room, and he -"

100
01:03:47,357 --> 01:03:50,957
"Young lady, do you know what this means?"

101
01:03:55,023 --> 01:03:59,223
"Yes - it means we are
going to be married."

102
01:04:40,527 --> 01:04:43,427
THE END
