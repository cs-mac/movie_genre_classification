1
00:02:09,246 --> 00:02:10,046
Yeah, baby!

2
00:02:28,643 --> 00:02:30,843
Hi, I'm Dixie. Dixie Normous.

3
00:02:34,899 --> 00:02:38,099
I may just be a small town FBI-agent, slash single mother.

4
00:02:38,904 --> 00:02:41,024
But I'm still tough...and sexy.

5
00:02:42,574 --> 00:02:43,334
Well, Miss Normous...

6
00:02:44,536 --> 00:02:47,896
Shall we shag now or shag later?

7
00:02:48,665 --> 00:02:51,145
Oh Austin...behave.

8
00:02:55,589 --> 00:02:56,469
Hey Powers!

9
00:02:58,843 --> 00:03:00,243
You better watch your freaking self.

10
00:03:00,344 --> 00:03:03,424
Because this is one doctor who does make house calls.

11
00:03:08,144 --> 00:03:09,144
Right, Mini-Me?

12
00:03:10,605 --> 00:03:11,685
Hey, assholes!

13
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:17,820
I'm right over here, I'm Mine-Me. Come and get me!

14
00:03:26,999 --> 00:03:29,439
- And cut!
- That's a cut everybody.

15
00:03:36,093 --> 00:03:37,733
So, Austin, what did you think of the opening credits?

16
00:03:38,553 --> 00:03:41,593
Well, I can't believe Sir Steven Spielberg, the grooviest -

17
00:03:41,765 --> 00:03:42,925
- film maker in history of cinema, -

18
00:03:43,601 --> 00:03:45,921
- is making a movie about my life.

19
00:03:46,604 --> 00:03:48,844
Very shagadelic baby, yeah!

20
00:03:50,942 --> 00:03:53,342
Having said that, I do have some thoughts.

21
00:03:54,321 --> 00:03:58,681
Really? My friend here thinks it's fine the way it is.

22
00:04:00,035 --> 00:04:04,595
Well no offense Sir Stevie, but you gotta have Mojo baby, yeah!

23
00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:06,809
Hit it!

24
00:05:17,622 --> 00:05:18,302
Ladies and Gentlemen.

25
00:05:18,372 --> 00:05:19,692
Sir Quincy Jones.

26
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:30,570
This is where the movie get its Mojo, baby.

27
00:05:47,446 --> 00:05:49,526
Alright, everybody. Music video, take 2.

28
00:05:49,657 --> 00:05:51,057
It's Britney Spears!

29
00:06:43,383 --> 00:06:45,583
Oops. I did it again, baby.

30
00:07:33,523 --> 00:07:34,803
Welcome back Herr Doctor.

31
00:07:35,316 --> 00:07:35,956
How was space?

32
00:07:36,442 --> 00:07:39,042
Space was cool, wasn't it Mini-Me?

33
00:07:41,281 --> 00:07:42,681
Doctor Evil, while you were in space.

34
00:07:43,241 --> 00:07:46,441
I created a way for us to make huge sums of legitimate money.

35
00:07:46,996 --> 00:07:49,636
And still maintain the ethics in the business practices -

36
00:07:50,708 --> 00:07:51,908
- of an evil organization.

37
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:57,780
- I have turned us into a talent agency. The Hollywood Talent Agency.
- Really?

38
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:02,010
By charging A-list clients 9 % rather that the traditional 10 %.

39
00:08:02,596 --> 00:08:03,916
We've been able to sign such stars -

40
00:08:04,014 --> 00:08:04,934
- such as George Clooney, -

41
00:08:05,725 --> 00:08:06,565
- Julia Roberts.

42
00:08:08,144 --> 00:08:09,144
And Leo DiCaprio.

43
00:08:09,645 --> 00:08:10,245
Leo!

44
00:08:10,938 --> 00:08:12,738
And the best part of the whole scheme is, -

45
00:08:13,107 --> 00:08:14,307
- we all get our own assistance.

46
00:08:15,903 --> 00:08:17,223
Hi, I'm Number 3.

47
00:08:20,115 --> 00:08:22,395
I'm really excited to be a part of the team, here in HTA.

48
00:08:22,952 --> 00:08:24,392
Very impressive, Number 2, -

49
00:08:25,663 --> 00:08:27,503
- but I finally have the perfect plan.

50
00:08:30,293 --> 00:08:32,693
In the 70s, there lived a Dutch metallurgical heathenish, -

51
00:08:32,838 --> 00:08:34,998
- by the name of Johann Van Der Smut.

52
00:08:35,716 --> 00:08:39,996
He loved gold so much he even lost his genitaliens in an
unfortunate smelting accident.

53
00:08:40,513 --> 00:08:44,433
Hence the name...Goldmember.

54
00:08:45,185 --> 00:08:49,105
He invented a cold fusion power unit for a..."Tractorbeam".

55
00:08:51,483 --> 00:08:52,523
"Tractorbeam"

56
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,360
Powerful enough to pull a meteor to Earth.

57
00:08:55,696 --> 00:08:58,896
The meteor was called..."Midas 22".

58
00:09:00,911 --> 00:09:03,511
It's made of solid gold...is he sleeping?

59
00:09:04,623 --> 00:09:08,423
Well, that's okay. I guess Mini-Me won't get any, CHOCOLATE!

60
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:14,300
You want down Mini-Me? Use your words like a big boy clone.

61
00:09:18,347 --> 00:09:19,267
He's okay!

62
00:09:21,976 --> 00:09:27,576
Here's the chocolate. It's from Brugge. That's in Belgium, that's where daddy's from.

63
00:09:33,697 --> 00:09:34,617
Check out Mini-Me.

64
00:09:35,991 --> 00:09:38,311
He's gone mental on candied chocolate.

65
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:41,435
It's like freakin' catnip for clothes.

66
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,193
- Your chair, Dr. Evil.
- Thank you.

67
00:09:57,015 --> 00:09:59,015
Thanks, scedadum, right.

68
00:09:59,726 --> 00:10:03,606
You know, when you have kids, I think your gonna find out
that all kids are different, ey?

69
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:12,340
For example: Mini-Me loves chocolate.

70
00:10:13,199 --> 00:10:14,039
Scotty don't!

71
00:10:14,409 --> 00:10:15,729
Well, I love chocolate fine. I just...

72
00:10:15,911 --> 00:10:16,591
Scotty don't!

73
00:10:16,661 --> 00:10:20,261
Oh yeah, very familiar, hang on, let me do what I do. Would you stop...

74
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:21,975
How about I what?

75
00:10:23,252 --> 00:10:23,692
What do you...

76
00:10:24,837 --> 00:10:25,477
I don't even...

77
00:10:26,631 --> 00:10:27,631
Honestly, isn't this...

78
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:30,199
How about you don't, ladies and gentlemen, Scotty don't.

79
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:35,030
Dr. Evil, perhaps it's time, that you finish unveiling your plan.

80
00:10:35,224 --> 00:10:36,584
Yes, thank you Number 2.

81
00:10:36,976 --> 00:10:38,496
Ladies and gentlemen, my plan is...

82
00:10:38,603 --> 00:10:39,363
Scotty don't.

83
00:10:39,562 --> 00:10:41,402
Oh, come on, you're such a lame ass!

84
00:10:54,536 --> 00:10:56,856
You know what? This is causing me serious psychological harm!

85
00:10:57,873 --> 00:10:59,513
I don't know. Who am I?

86
00:10:59,626 --> 00:11:01,786
Fine. You know what? I would love some chocolate.

87
00:11:02,045 --> 00:11:03,885
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

88
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:12,300
Heel Mini-Me!

89
00:11:14,684 --> 00:11:15,484
Come on!

90
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,400
You okay, Mini-Me?

91
00:11:22,609 --> 00:11:24,489
Did I pull too hard? I don't want to hurt you.

92
00:11:24,736 --> 00:11:26,016
- Dr. Evil.
- Yo?

93
00:11:26,238 --> 00:11:28,878
What does Goldmember's plan have to do with us?

94
00:11:29,617 --> 00:11:32,617
Our earlier attempts of the tractorbeam went through several preparations.

95
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:35,650
Preparation A through G were a complete failure.

96
00:11:35,915 --> 00:11:39,755
But now ladies and gentlemen, we finally have a working tractorbeam.

97
00:11:40,379 --> 00:11:43,619
Which we shall call "Preparation H".

98
00:11:46,678 --> 00:11:47,318
What?

99
00:11:47,971 --> 00:11:50,851
Why don't you just call it "Operation Ass-creamy", ass?

100
00:11:52,017 --> 00:11:53,537
I'm sorry did you want some ice-cream?

101
00:11:53,894 --> 00:11:56,694
Yes, I'd love some chocolate ass-cream.

102
00:11:58,608 --> 00:11:59,528
Perhaps later.

103
00:11:59,901 --> 00:12:01,821
Dr. Evil, I love your plan.

104
00:12:03,447 --> 00:12:06,047
Ja, Herr Doctor, it's a really good plan.

105
00:12:06,491 --> 00:12:09,531
Yes, Frau, on the whole, I think Preparation H fells good.

106
00:12:11,914 --> 00:12:12,594
What is it now?

107
00:12:12,957 --> 00:12:14,837
No, nothing. You know what? I agree...

108
00:12:15,209 --> 00:12:17,249
Preparation H does feel good.

109
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:18,670
On the hole.

110
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:22,072
Well, I'm glad wir sprechen sie the same lingity.

111
00:12:23,343 --> 00:12:28,743
Ladies and gentlemen. Using my time machine I shall travel back to 1975.

112
00:12:29,267 --> 00:12:31,707
Pick up Goldmember and bring him back to the future.

113
00:12:32,437 --> 00:12:34,517
And the best part of this plan is...

114
00:12:35,649 --> 00:12:36,889
No one can stop me.

115
00:12:37,985 --> 00:12:41,345
Not even...Austin Powers.

116
00:12:53,585 --> 00:12:55,265
Not so fast.

117
00:12:55,838 --> 00:12:57,438
You're sorrounded Dr. Evil.

118
00:12:59,342 --> 00:13:00,022
Shit!

119
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:06,820
Dr. Evil, the world court sentences you to 400 years.

120
00:13:07,184 --> 00:13:08,824
Do you have anything to say?

121
00:13:09,186 --> 00:13:11,986
No, but I think Mini-Me does.

122
00:13:18,655 --> 00:13:20,255
Looks like two eggs and a hankie.

123
00:13:23,744 --> 00:13:26,864
The criminal genius known as, Dr. Evil and his clone -

124
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:28,919
- were sentenced today at the world organization.

125
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,460
For his efforts, Austin Powers, -

126
00:13:31,586 --> 00:13:33,786
- the son of England's most famous spy, Nigel Powers.

127
00:13:34,172 --> 00:13:36,452
Will be knighted by The Queen at Buckingham Palace.

128
00:13:40,303 --> 00:13:42,743
Arise, Sir Austin Powers.

129
00:13:43,974 --> 00:13:45,174
Thank you, Your Majesty.

130
00:13:45,393 --> 00:13:48,033
Your father must be very proud of you.

131
00:13:48,312 --> 00:13:49,472
Oh, yeah.

132
00:13:49,981 --> 00:13:51,901
Come on dad, stand up and take a bow.

133
00:15:09,027 --> 00:15:10,347
"Daddy wasn't there" Peace!

134
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:15,170
I am a sexy beast.

135
00:15:24,127 --> 00:15:27,247
It's Austin Powers, you're so funny.

136
00:15:28,006 --> 00:15:29,606
Also very sexy.

137
00:15:30,634 --> 00:15:31,314
Can I have an autograph?

138
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:33,550
Of course, your name is?

139
00:15:34,097 --> 00:15:34,857
Fook Mi.

140
00:15:36,558 --> 00:15:40,838
Oh behave, baby. Now your name is?

141
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,120
Fook Mi.

142
00:15:42,731 --> 00:15:44,051
You kiss your mother with that mouth?

143
00:15:45,025 --> 00:15:47,065
Fook Mi, like this.

144
00:15:48,905 --> 00:15:50,425
Oh I see.

145
00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:52,744
Your name is Fook Mi.

146
00:15:53,618 --> 00:15:54,418
You want a drink?

147
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:59,375
Yes of course, but I have private bar in the back, that you are more than welcome to use...

148
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:00,185
Here you go.

149
00:16:01,252 --> 00:16:02,852
Fook Mi! That was fast!

150
00:16:03,588 --> 00:16:04,468
Fook Yu.

151
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:07,924
Oh, you're going the right way for a smack-bottom and I don't care who knows it!

152
00:16:10,304 --> 00:16:11,144
Austin.

153
00:16:12,806 --> 00:16:19,166
This is my twin sister, her name, Fook Yu. Fook Yu...Fook Mi.

154
00:16:21,274 --> 00:16:22,874
Twins...twins

155
00:16:28,073 --> 00:16:31,313
Twins. Yes. We're going to see the twins.

156
00:16:34,455 --> 00:16:37,415
I also think Austin Powers is very sexy.

157
00:16:38,293 --> 00:16:40,133
We think you're very great.

158
00:16:41,254 --> 00:16:43,054
We make you sleepy?

159
00:16:43,298 --> 00:16:45,778
Well, you make me many things, but sleepy is not one of them.

160
00:16:47,303 --> 00:16:52,703
- We give you top secret massage.
- Yes, top secret massage, baby!

161
00:16:56,897 --> 00:16:59,577
Sorry about that, I swear to God, that never happens.

162
00:17:01,193 --> 00:17:02,433
Yes, hold on a tick.

163
00:17:08,701 --> 00:17:10,741
Okay, now where were we, baby?

164
00:17:16,043 --> 00:17:18,363
Ah, Austin. I'm sorry to interrupt.

165
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:20,790
Twins, Basil. Twins.

166
00:17:20,924 --> 00:17:22,804
Austin, it's your father.

167
00:17:24,052 --> 00:17:25,612
- What?
- He's been kidnapped.

168
00:17:28,641 --> 00:17:34,601
Very heavy, man. Oh, so that's why my father wasn't at the knighting ceremony.

169
00:17:35,356 --> 00:17:36,796
Well, no actually.

170
00:17:36,899 --> 00:17:39,099
He was kidnapped after you were knighted.

171
00:17:41,113 --> 00:17:43,113
He was last seen on his yatch.

172
00:17:43,406 --> 00:17:47,806
Oh, yes. The "HMS Shag-at-sea".
- Exactly, just take a look.

173
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:49,407
Gentlemen fall in.

174
00:17:50,289 --> 00:17:53,009
Austin, these men were signed to guard you father.

175
00:17:53,418 --> 00:17:55,458
Okay, chaps, chins up, trousers down.

176
00:17:56,171 --> 00:17:57,851
I think we may have found a clue.

177
00:18:00,258 --> 00:18:05,538
Gold blimey! All your privates have had their privates painted gold. How bizarre.

178
00:18:06,098 --> 00:18:11,098
Imagine, guilded tally-wackers, golden wedding-tackle, fourteen-carat trousers snakes...

179
00:18:11,355 --> 00:18:13,115
- That's enough.
- Okay.

180
00:18:13,982 --> 00:18:16,302
Basil, there is only one person in the world, -

181
00:18:16,443 --> 00:18:19,123
- who truly understand the psychology of a mad man...

182
00:18:20,865 --> 00:18:22,345
- Dr. Evil.
- Dr. Evil.

183
00:18:46,018 --> 00:18:47,578
I've been expecting you, Mr. Powers.

184
00:18:48,437 --> 00:18:49,837
My father is missing.

185
00:18:50,398 --> 00:18:52,638
Yes, I've heard. How ironic.

186
00:18:53,192 --> 00:18:56,632
You finally caught me, yet now you need me more that ever.

187
00:18:57,239 --> 00:19:00,279
But then again, you've always needed me, haven't you Mr. Powers?

188
00:19:01,159 --> 00:19:04,359
Remember when I told you, we are not so different you and I?

189
00:19:05,581 --> 00:19:07,701
We are not so different you and I.

190
00:19:09,335 --> 00:19:12,135
- See, I did say that.
- Very clever.

191
00:19:12,589 --> 00:19:14,069
Now who has my father?

192
00:19:14,591 --> 00:19:17,351
Oh, oh...someone have some daddy issues.

193
00:19:18,262 --> 00:19:20,142
Nothing could be my father from the truth.

194
00:19:21,515 --> 00:19:24,115
- You said my father.
- No, I didn't.

195
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:26,390
Didn't, did not.

196
00:19:28,148 --> 00:19:29,708
For me this is a dad issue.

197
00:19:32,736 --> 00:19:34,096
Daddy love me.

198
00:19:35,239 --> 00:19:38,599
It seems the knighting ceremony wasn't the only time your... -

199
00:19:40,286 --> 00:19:41,966
- daddy let you down.

200
00:19:46,418 --> 00:19:48,938
Remember that day at the academy? Think!

201
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:52,790
It was graduation.

202
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:02,730
Yeah, baby, yeah. Do I make you horny, baby?

203
00:20:03,603 --> 00:20:04,843
That, that's the spot. Right there.

204
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:12,290
Have you ever heard of knocking, man?

205
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:16,280
- Right!
- We were just getting started.

206
00:20:18,704 --> 00:20:22,344
Don't forget, Mr. Powers, may tell you about the brief oral exam.

207
00:20:22,791 --> 00:20:28,271
When I have the bit, it's mostly oral, and not too...brief, baby.

208
00:20:29,465 --> 00:20:31,905
You know, brief and oral exam.

209
00:20:39,476 --> 00:20:43,796
It looks like Master Evil is the top-contender for this year's International Man of Mystery.

210
00:20:44,649 --> 00:20:45,809
He's number one in the class.

211
00:20:48,445 --> 00:20:50,845
Hey, everybody, I'm Number 1.

212
00:20:52,783 --> 00:20:54,383
Hello, I'm Number 2.

213
00:20:55,453 --> 00:20:56,773
Nice to meet you Number 2.

214
00:20:56,955 --> 00:21:00,915
But, now I'm going to be named this year's International Man of Mystery.

215
00:21:14,349 --> 00:21:16,509
Who throws a cup cake? Honestly?

216
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:27,180
And now it's time for award of greatest honour. This year's International Man of Mystery is...

217
00:21:28,114 --> 00:21:31,954
- Austin Powers!
- Well done Austin.

218
00:21:45,508 --> 00:21:48,948
It has always been my dream to win this award just like my dad.

219
00:21:50,055 --> 00:21:51,135
Glad he could be here.

220
00:21:51,849 --> 00:21:53,449
Stand up, dad. Take a bow.

221
00:22:00,692 --> 00:22:01,932
Dad?

222
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:20,876
I had the best grades in the class, and I didn't get diddly squat.

223
00:22:21,924 --> 00:22:23,724
- Here we go.
- Tell me Mr. Powers.

224
00:22:24,135 --> 00:22:30,015
What did you find on those sailors? A golden surprise? Perhaps?

225
00:22:31,434 --> 00:22:36,914
How did...yes...all the sailors had their meat and two vege painted gold.

226
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:41,270
Yes, it's the distinctive calling card of a criminal master mind.

227
00:22:41,695 --> 00:22:42,535
The abli named...

228
00:22:45,158 --> 00:22:46,238
Goldmember.

229
00:22:49,163 --> 00:22:50,843
How can I find this Goldmember?

230
00:22:53,125 --> 00:22:54,685
Quid pro quo, Mr Powers.

231
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:58,320
Yes, squid pro row.

232
00:22:59,674 --> 00:23:03,674
I'll give you Goldmember. You give me a transfer to a regular prison.

233
00:23:04,596 --> 00:23:07,676
So that I could be with my beloved Mini-Me.

234
00:23:08,351 --> 00:23:12,751
Okay. I'll get you a transfer to a regular prison. Now where's Goldmember?

235
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:14,710
Not where Mr. Powers, -

236
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:16,410
- but when.

237
00:23:17,235 --> 00:23:21,835
1975 'Studio 69' Disco. New York City. Corner 69 and 8th.

238
00:23:22,867 --> 00:23:25,667
You go now, Mr. Powers. Fly fly.

239
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:35,460
I'll get it.

240
00:23:43,098 --> 00:23:49,178
Instead of hiding your father in some remote location. Goldmember's hiding in 1975.

241
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:53,210
So our engineers has crafted this vehicle, -

242
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,120
- to time travel to the 70s.

243
00:23:55,361 --> 00:24:01,521
- Smashing, Basil. A pimp mobile.
- Yes, yes, I knew it would tickle your fancy.

244
00:24:02,243 --> 00:24:04,803
What can I say? Look. Cough...

245
00:24:07,082 --> 00:24:09,842
Here we go, 1975.

246
00:24:10,419 --> 00:24:11,219
Good luck, Austin.

247
00:24:11,587 --> 00:24:15,107
1975, yeah baby, yeah!

248
00:25:38,308 --> 00:25:42,028
Good evening, everybody. And welcome to Studio 69.

249
00:25:42,646 --> 00:25:46,446
Here he is, ladies and gentlemen, Goldmember.

250
00:25:56,454 --> 00:26:00,414
Everybody, I'm from Holland! Isn't that wierd?

251
00:27:23,299 --> 00:27:25,859
Well. If it isn't Austin Powers.

252
00:27:26,428 --> 00:27:26,988
I'm sorry?

253
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:30,310
You got a lot of nerve, jagging your jive white ass in here.

254
00:27:31,058 --> 00:27:32,298
I don't belive we have met.

255
00:27:34,103 --> 00:27:37,303
It's me Foxxy. Foxxy Cleopatra.

256
00:27:37,941 --> 00:27:39,301
Long time no see.

257
00:27:41,027 --> 00:27:41,747
Stop!

258
00:27:42,404 --> 00:27:44,284
We can't be seen talking to each other. You dig?

259
00:27:44,698 --> 00:27:46,378
I'm using this cat as a distration.

260
00:27:47,201 --> 00:27:48,801
I get it, yes, very clever.

261
00:27:49,621 --> 00:27:50,781
First things first.

262
00:27:54,334 --> 00:27:57,934
Eight years and no phonecall? Nobody stands up Foxxy Cleopatra!

263
00:27:58,422 --> 00:27:59,302
Where have you been?

264
00:27:59,923 --> 00:28:04,523
Listen Foxxy. I just want you to know I never intended to hurt you, baby.

265
00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:12,970
Well, all I know is. Momma only got a taste of honey.
But she wanted the whole beehive.

266
00:28:15,316 --> 00:28:21,436
- Oh, beehive!
- You always knew how to make me smile.

267
00:28:22,157 --> 00:28:26,117
Well you know it's a gift really, I...what am I doing?

268
00:28:26,411 --> 00:28:28,851
Foxxy, what are you doing i Goldmember's club?

269
00:28:30,499 --> 00:28:31,299
I'm undercover.

270
00:28:31,959 --> 00:28:34,799
About a year ago, my partner at the bureau was killed.

271
00:28:35,671 --> 00:28:38,631
And that jive-ass turkey, Goldmember is the prime suspect.

272
00:28:41,302 --> 00:28:42,462
Your father is in the back room -

273
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:43,851
- under heavy guard.

274
00:28:44,056 --> 00:28:44,696
Thanks Foxxy.

275
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:46,648
Austin, good luck.

276
00:29:04,912 --> 00:29:05,752
Dad!

277
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:09,190
Hello son. Just overpowering my guards.

278
00:29:09,667 --> 00:29:11,867
I'm here to rescue you. Come quickly!

279
00:29:12,129 --> 00:29:15,969
I got a better idea. Why don't you rescue me in about...what seven or eight minuts?

280
00:29:17,927 --> 00:29:18,847
Knock it off.

281
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:22,260
I don't wanna see my dad on the job. Come on let's go.

282
00:29:22,682 --> 00:29:25,602
Okay, I'm sorry. I'm sorry girls. I gotta...

283
00:29:30,065 --> 00:29:31,225
What's wrong with your neck?

284
00:29:31,442 --> 00:29:35,002
I took a Viagra, it got stuck in my throat and I've had a stiff neck for hours.

285
00:29:37,991 --> 00:29:41,671
Listen, dad, if you are gonna talk about naughty things infront of these American girls.

286
00:29:42,454 --> 00:29:44,174
Then at least speak english-english.

287
00:29:45,457 --> 00:29:47,017
All right, my son.

288
00:30:18,536 --> 00:30:20,056
God, that was good times, son.

289
00:30:30,173 --> 00:30:34,253
Welcome to 1975, Austin Powers and fassia.

290
00:30:35,346 --> 00:30:38,586
Excuse me, while I change, the hola boogie has made me sweaty.

291
00:30:40,852 --> 00:30:42,412
You see Mr. Powers.

292
00:30:45,648 --> 00:30:48,208
I love gold.

293
00:30:49,361 --> 00:30:53,881
The look of it, the taste of it, the smell of it, the texture...

294
00:30:54,409 --> 00:30:55,569
I love gold so much -

295
00:30:56,077 --> 00:30:58,037
- that I even lost my genitalier -

296
00:30:58,162 --> 00:31:00,202
- in an unfortunate smelting accident.

297
00:31:01,083 --> 00:31:04,083
Hence the name...Goldmember.

298
00:31:13,096 --> 00:31:14,896
We're both swingers, you see?

299
00:31:16,182 --> 00:31:17,302
You have a toite body.

300
00:31:17,684 --> 00:31:20,404
Yesh, I see that from your toite bands.

301
00:31:21,355 --> 00:31:23,795
Yesh, you are toite like a toiger!

302
00:31:24,525 --> 00:31:26,205
Would you like a shmoke and a pancake?

303
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:27,870
A what?

304
00:31:27,946 --> 00:31:29,346
A shmoke and a pancake?

305
00:31:29,948 --> 00:31:32,348
You, know. flapjack and a cigarette?

306
00:31:32,909 --> 00:31:35,909
Hm? All right. Shigar and a waffle? No?

307
00:31:36,622 --> 00:31:38,182
Pipe and a crepe? No?

308
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:39,420
Bong and a blintz?

309
00:31:40,584 --> 00:31:43,264
Oh, well. Then there is no pleasing you.

310
00:31:43,797 --> 00:31:44,757
That's not right.

311
00:31:45,757 --> 00:31:48,237
Uh, hello, what have we here?

312
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:51,920
That's a keeper, yesh. Put it in the skin-box, please.

313
00:31:53,224 --> 00:31:54,144
I'm peeling.

314
00:31:54,642 --> 00:31:56,442
Oh, that's just disgusting.

315
00:31:56,686 --> 00:31:58,286
Quickly, quickly, thank you.

316
00:31:58,479 --> 00:31:59,479
Save me for myself.

317
00:31:59,814 --> 00:32:01,814
You're insane Goldmember!

318
00:32:03,610 --> 00:32:06,090
"And that's the away, uh-huh uh-huh, I like it."

319
00:32:06,488 --> 00:32:08,288
K.C. and the Sunshine Band.

320
00:32:08,866 --> 00:32:12,106
Alright, Goldmember. Don't play the laughing boy.

321
00:32:12,746 --> 00:32:15,026
There are only two things, I can't stand in this world:

322
00:32:15,790 --> 00:32:18,710
People who are intolerant of other people's cultures.

323
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:20,920
And the Dutch.

324
00:32:21,213 --> 00:32:21,853
What?

325
00:32:25,718 --> 00:32:27,798
Take the fassia away.

326
00:32:29,347 --> 00:32:33,587
Dutch-hater. And now it is time to say goodbye.

327
00:32:34,103 --> 00:32:35,823
Dr. Evil's orders.

328
00:32:36,188 --> 00:32:39,588
"Which for you is bad news, bears."

329
00:32:39,942 --> 00:32:40,902
Walter Matthau.

330
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:44,630
Sha-zam! Up yours jive-turkey.

331
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,040
Traitor!

332
00:32:47,951 --> 00:32:49,391
Here's the gun, point it at him.

333
00:32:49,787 --> 00:32:50,827
2002!

334
00:32:52,623 --> 00:32:55,903
- They're taking my father to the time machine.
- You say what-machine?

335
00:32:56,085 --> 00:32:56,645
Come on now.

336
00:32:58,922 --> 00:32:59,722
This way, sugar!

337
00:33:10,185 --> 00:33:12,145
That was close Foxxy, I owe you one.

338
00:33:12,395 --> 00:33:14,515
Austin, I found this in Goldmember's office.

339
00:33:14,772 --> 00:33:17,332
- It's a microfilm, maybe a clue.
- Smashing.

340
00:33:17,484 --> 00:33:18,604
I wanna go to the future with you.

341
00:33:19,402 --> 00:33:22,162
We can catch Goldmember together. I owe it to my partner.

342
00:33:22,739 --> 00:33:25,259
I should warn you Foxxy, 2002 is very different.

343
00:33:25,702 --> 00:33:28,062
Well, the future better get ready for me.

344
00:33:28,788 --> 00:33:30,428
Because I'm Foxxy Cleopatra.

345
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:32,460
And I'm a whole lotta woman!

346
00:33:35,921 --> 00:33:37,761
2002, here we come!

347
00:33:46,098 --> 00:33:48,498
All visitations limited five minuts.

348
00:33:49,395 --> 00:33:51,355
No spitting in the visitors room.

349
00:33:55,651 --> 00:33:58,491
Herr Doctor. I have some news.

350
00:33:59,322 --> 00:34:00,162
It's your son.

351
00:34:01,032 --> 00:34:05,512
- He wants to take over the family business.
- Scotty does?

352
00:34:06,246 --> 00:34:09,646
- He's gotten so evil he's even started losing his hair.
- I know, it's sweet.

353
00:34:10,501 --> 00:34:12,861
Oh, he just wants to make you proud, Herr Doctor.

354
00:34:13,421 --> 00:34:15,661
After all it's hard on the boy not having a father.

355
00:34:16,049 --> 00:34:20,329
You know. First you were frozen, then you were in space, now you're in jail.

356
00:34:20,554 --> 00:34:22,554
Don't tell me he feels neglected.

357
00:34:23,139 --> 00:34:25,539
I was adopted by freakin' Belgians.

358
00:34:26,185 --> 00:34:27,425
You were adopted?

359
00:34:27,645 --> 00:34:29,525
I never met my birth parents.

360
00:34:30,398 --> 00:34:31,518
There was a car accident.

361
00:34:32,985 --> 00:34:35,385
I'm told that it was a beautiful Belgium day.

362
00:34:35,988 --> 00:34:40,868
The smell of waffles and brussels sprout filled the summer air...until...

363
00:34:43,037 --> 00:34:44,717
My birthmother was incinerated.

364
00:34:45,373 --> 00:34:48,013
I only survived because of her smoking carcass -

365
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:51,140
- formed a protective coocoon of slaughtered human effluence.

366
00:34:52,297 --> 00:34:55,457
A Belgium man and his 15-year old love slave with wet feet -

367
00:34:55,634 --> 00:34:59,034
- was looting the accident scene, they come across a bloodsoaked baby...moi!

368
00:34:59,555 --> 00:35:03,915
They raised me to be evil. You know, that old chestnut.

369
00:35:04,727 --> 00:35:05,407
Ja.

370
00:35:05,728 --> 00:35:07,368
But nothing compares to this.

371
00:35:07,731 --> 00:35:10,811
Being inside the belly of the beast, night after night all alone...

372
00:35:11,235 --> 00:35:13,475
Daddy's all pant up, let's freak.

373
00:35:31,799 --> 00:35:32,519
Times up!

374
00:35:33,051 --> 00:35:35,051
Visitings hours are over. Get to the line.

375
00:35:36,095 --> 00:35:37,095
Cuffs up!

376
00:35:43,646 --> 00:35:44,366
Move it!

377
00:35:49,736 --> 00:35:52,336
Hi there. How are you sleeping? Good?

378
00:35:55,618 --> 00:35:58,018
Gentlemen, listen up, ya'll.

379
00:35:58,454 --> 00:35:59,534
Here's the new plan.

380
00:36:00,873 --> 00:36:02,153
You're gonna start a riot.

381
00:36:02,917 --> 00:36:05,077
And we're gonna walk out the front door.

382
00:36:08,799 --> 00:36:13,079
Hey man, I know guys on crack that makes more sense than you.

383
00:36:14,054 --> 00:36:14,774
Really?

384
00:36:15,473 --> 00:36:17,633
Then let me put it to you this way, 'coz...

385
00:37:41,318 --> 00:37:45,318
Alright, listen up! Tonight 8 PM you're gonna start a riot.

386
00:37:45,948 --> 00:37:47,548
Yes, Dr. Evil!

387
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:51,480
Attention all guards. There is a riot in progress.

388
00:37:51,871 --> 00:37:53,151
Seal all exits!

389
00:37:54,249 --> 00:37:58,289
Attention, Dr. Evil and his clone are trying to escape.

390
00:37:59,088 --> 00:38:02,568
All guards report to cell block A immediately...

391
00:38:15,063 --> 00:38:17,903
There you are. Good morning, sunshine.

392
00:38:18,193 --> 00:38:19,073
Good morning.

393
00:38:19,693 --> 00:38:20,373
How did you sleep?

394
00:38:21,321 --> 00:38:22,481
- Great!
- Me too.

395
00:38:22,989 --> 00:38:24,229
If these lips could talk.

396
00:38:26,202 --> 00:38:27,442
Oh, hello.

397
00:38:29,497 --> 00:38:31,697
You have the right to remain sexy, sugar.

398
00:38:31,833 --> 00:38:34,113
Oh, I hope there's a search involved.

399
00:38:36,504 --> 00:38:37,464
You got mail.

400
00:38:37,964 --> 00:38:39,564
So, what does this thing do?

401
00:38:40,342 --> 00:38:41,942
Well, it's called the Internet.

402
00:38:42,135 --> 00:38:46,135
It complete revolutionize the way we live and access vital information.

403
00:38:46,431 --> 00:38:47,831
For example, have a look at this.

404
00:38:56,735 --> 00:38:59,855
- Now that's vital information!
- I know it's amazing.

405
00:39:02,783 --> 00:39:07,223
- Oh, Basil, what's happening, baby?
- A lot is happening Foxxy.

406
00:39:07,664 --> 00:39:09,384
Dr. Evil has escaped.

407
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:14,930
The good news is one of our agents has managed to infiltrate
Dr. Evil's organization.

408
00:39:15,589 --> 00:39:19,189
Excellent, Basil we have been tried for years, to get a mole inside Dr. Evil's lair.

409
00:39:19,385 --> 00:39:21,305
- We now have that mole.
- Yes.

410
00:39:22,013 --> 00:39:23,613
Ah, and here he is.

411
00:39:26,518 --> 00:39:27,278
So, you're the...

412
00:39:29,104 --> 00:39:32,664
Mo...mo...mo...

413
00:39:32,858 --> 00:39:36,698
Most...most...most excellent agent we've ever seen.

414
00:39:37,154 --> 00:39:40,394
Yes, the most excellent agent we've ever seen. Thank you.

415
00:39:41,285 --> 00:39:42,365
Thank you.

416
00:39:43,370 --> 00:39:44,730
Now I wasn't able to get the exact location.

417
00:39:45,122 --> 00:39:48,602
But I did learn that Dr. Evil has moved to a new lair outside Tokyo, Japan.

418
00:39:52,506 --> 00:39:54,866
By the way I realize that I have a large mole on my face.

419
00:39:56,468 --> 00:39:59,988
Where? What? Where's that mole? I didn't see one.

420
00:40:04,018 --> 00:40:07,298
I also realize the ironi, that I am myself...a mole.

421
00:40:08,481 --> 00:40:10,161
No one would make that connection.

422
00:40:13,403 --> 00:40:17,323
Anyway...well done, old chap. Jolly good work.

423
00:40:17,950 --> 00:40:19,630
Nice to mole you...meet you!

424
00:40:19,869 --> 00:40:22,229
- Nice to meet you, Mole! Don't say mole.
- Stop!

425
00:40:22,372 --> 00:40:23,452
- I said mole.
- Stop!

426
00:40:27,878 --> 00:40:28,598
- Bye
- Mole!

427
00:40:33,801 --> 00:40:34,481
Mole!

428
00:40:38,931 --> 00:40:39,771
Mole!

429
00:40:40,058 --> 00:40:41,298
Oh, shut up!

430
00:40:43,896 --> 00:40:46,056
Moley, moley, moley, moley, moley!

431
00:41:01,289 --> 00:41:02,329
Up periscope.

432
00:41:08,423 --> 00:41:09,503
Ladies and gentlemen.

433
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:12,420
Welcome to my new submarine lair.

434
00:41:14,554 --> 00:41:16,594
It's long and hard, and full of seamen.

435
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:23,445
Nothing?

436
00:41:23,522 --> 00:41:24,162
No?

437
00:41:24,232 --> 00:41:25,232
Not even a titter?

438
00:41:26,401 --> 00:41:27,121
Tough sub.

439
00:41:27,444 --> 00:41:33,684
- Dr. Evil, You look very toit! Yesh, toit like a toiger! Yesh Yesh Yesh!
- Really?

440
00:41:33,993 --> 00:41:35,273
Yesh, you look like a "macho-man".

441
00:41:35,578 --> 00:41:36,818
Village People.

442
00:41:37,705 --> 00:41:38,785
You know, Goldmember?

443
00:41:38,873 --> 00:41:41,833
I don't think that's something one dude should say to another dude!

444
00:41:42,376 --> 00:41:43,736
Yeah! A little creepy!

445
00:41:45,130 --> 00:41:47,970
Ooh yesh! Yesh yesh yesh yesh! This is a keeper!

446
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:55,160
Alright... you're not going to put that skin in your mouth, are you?

447
00:41:56,893 --> 00:41:58,973
You did... ok... that's just gross!

448
00:42:00,605 --> 00:42:02,725
Yesh, salty! Yesh that was good!

449
00:42:03,108 --> 00:42:04,228
Ladies and gentlemen.

450
00:42:06,654 --> 00:42:07,574
As you know.

451
00:42:08,531 --> 00:42:10,851
We've been designing a "tractorbeam".

452
00:42:11,409 --> 00:42:13,169
Code name Preparation H.

453
00:42:14,037 --> 00:42:18,677
It's powerful enough to pull the meteor..."Midas 22".

454
00:42:19,335 --> 00:42:21,335
Into a collision course with the Earth, -

455
00:42:21,712 --> 00:42:24,952
- upon entering the atmosphere the hot ball of magma.

456
00:42:26,133 --> 00:42:29,453
Will strike and melt the polar icecaps, causing a global flood.

457
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:32,100
But enough of my technical mumbo-jumbo.

458
00:42:32,474 --> 00:42:33,794
Allow me to demonstrate.

459
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:40,110
Lower the globe.

460
00:42:40,567 --> 00:42:42,407
Lower the globe!

461
00:42:43,528 --> 00:42:45,448
Av, av...

462
00:42:45,781 --> 00:42:46,781
Scheisse.

463
00:42:47,116 --> 00:42:49,116
Well, congratulations numb nuts... -

464
00:42:49,618 --> 00:42:53,058
- you've succeeded in turning me into a frickin' Jack in the box!

465
00:42:53,664 --> 00:42:56,144
Get it off. Get it off! It's dark. It's dark.

466
00:42:56,626 --> 00:42:58,266
I'm okay, I'm okay.

467
00:42:59,671 --> 00:43:01,111
Release the meteor.

468
00:43:01,506 --> 00:43:02,946
Release the meteor!

469
00:43:08,722 --> 00:43:09,802
No way!

470
00:43:09,974 --> 00:43:11,614
Right in the kanickies!

471
00:43:11,851 --> 00:43:12,891
God dammit!

472
00:43:14,813 --> 00:43:15,933
Guys!

473
00:43:16,773 --> 00:43:18,053
Way to go a-hole!

474
00:43:18,567 --> 00:43:22,247
All right hold on, let me try to find my balls for God's sakes!

475
00:43:22,571 --> 00:43:26,011
One, two... and three, okay. I'm okay!

476
00:43:27,327 --> 00:43:30,967
Dr. Evil, we still have the ultimate insurances policy.

477
00:43:31,414 --> 00:43:35,094
May I present to you the very sexual, the very toite.

478
00:43:36,253 --> 00:43:38,853
Austin Powers fassia.

479
00:43:39,674 --> 00:43:40,514
His what?

480
00:43:40,842 --> 00:43:42,202
His fassia Dr. Evil.

481
00:43:42,551 --> 00:43:43,511
His ferder?

482
00:43:44,679 --> 00:43:47,999
- What's a ferder?
-His fassia! You know, the fassia.

483
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:51,840
Yeah Goldmember, I dont speak freaky-deaky dutch.

484
00:43:52,437 --> 00:43:53,677
Okay perv boy?

485
00:43:53,772 --> 00:43:55,812
Fassia, his dad, dad is fassia.

486
00:43:55,941 --> 00:43:59,141
Oh his dad, oh his FATHER.

487
00:43:59,571 --> 00:44:00,771
Yes, that's the right accent.

488
00:44:01,156 --> 00:44:01,996
Isn't that wierd.

489
00:44:02,574 --> 00:44:04,134
Father, father.

490
00:44:04,951 --> 00:44:08,631
- Ah, Nigel Powers.
- Hello, hello.

491
00:44:12,543 --> 00:44:13,583
Bring him to me!

492
00:44:13,669 --> 00:44:15,749
Easy peasy lemon squeezy!

493
00:44:17,549 --> 00:44:20,229
Put the guns down. Is this the first day on the job or something?

494
00:44:20,386 --> 00:44:23,826
Look, this is how it goes... You attack me one at a time.

495
00:44:24,306 --> 00:44:27,066
And I knock you out in a single punch. Okay, go!

496
00:44:28,269 --> 00:44:29,069
Oh, he's good.

497
00:44:30,980 --> 00:44:31,980
Do you know who I am?

498
00:44:32,941 --> 00:44:36,541
Have you any idea how many anonymous henchmen I've killed over the years?

499
00:44:37,362 --> 00:44:39,242
And look at you. You haven't even got a name tag.

500
00:44:39,448 --> 00:44:40,568
You got no chance!

501
00:44:41,409 --> 00:44:42,409
Why don't you just fall down?

502
00:44:46,163 --> 00:44:49,443
Alright, Dr. Evil give yourself up, while you still got a chance.

503
00:44:51,712 --> 00:44:54,512
Okay, okay. You got me.

504
00:44:55,091 --> 00:44:58,851
Nigel Powers, meet...Mini-Me.

505
00:44:59,053 --> 00:45:01,293
Oh, blimey. I though I smelled cabbage.

506
00:45:02,557 --> 00:45:03,477
Take hime away!

507
00:45:04,434 --> 00:45:07,554
Dr. Evil, can I paint his yoo-hoo gold?

508
00:45:08,397 --> 00:45:09,917
It's kindda my thing, you know?

509
00:45:16,572 --> 00:45:19,652
How about no, you crazy Dutch bastard!

510
00:45:22,245 --> 00:45:26,165
Attention henchmen. It's health week. Don't forget your physical. Dr. Evil's orders.

511
00:45:31,506 --> 00:45:33,626
You know, I think it's a shame the way they treat you.

512
00:45:34,509 --> 00:45:36,429
Just because you're one-eight their size.

513
00:45:37,429 --> 00:45:39,989
Doesn't mean you deserve one-eight of their respect.

514
00:45:43,269 --> 00:45:46,309
Mini fella. I'm...I'm curious.

515
00:45:47,982 --> 00:45:51,062
Is everything in proportion.

516
00:45:52,738 --> 00:45:53,938
You know your bobby dangler, -

517
00:45:54,031 --> 00:45:55,591
your general, two colonels.

518
00:45:55,699 --> 00:45:57,859
Your giggle stick, master of ceremonies.

519
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:00,959
Yeah, don't be shy, let's have a look.

520
00:46:07,254 --> 00:46:09,734
My word! You're a tripod.

521
00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:15,780
What do you feed that thing? It's like a baby's arm holding an apple.

522
00:46:17,682 --> 00:46:19,882
The good news is. If you ever get tired.

523
00:46:20,269 --> 00:46:21,669
You can use it as a kick-stand.

524
00:46:27,276 --> 00:46:30,276
I think we both know who the real brain is behind this operation.

525
00:46:46,422 --> 00:46:48,782
Tokyo, a go go, baby, yeah!

526
00:46:51,428 --> 00:46:52,588
What's kicking, Basil?

527
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:54,320
A lot's kicking, Foxxy.

528
00:46:55,016 --> 00:46:55,736
Austin?

529
00:46:55,808 --> 00:47:00,008
One of Dr. Evil's henchmen has been spotted at the Asahi Sumo Arena.

530
00:47:00,229 --> 00:47:03,029
- See there immediately.
- Thanks, Basil.

531
00:47:09,906 --> 00:47:14,106
Ah, Jesus Christ, this diaper is making my nuts rub together.

532
00:47:14,787 --> 00:47:16,707
It's gonna start a fire!

533
00:47:17,832 --> 00:47:19,152
That's Fat Bastard!

534
00:47:36,019 --> 00:47:37,979
Do you know what my favorite Helen Hunt movie is?

535
00:47:38,564 --> 00:47:39,324
TWISTER!

536
00:47:51,703 --> 00:47:53,623
- That's not right.
- Sure ain't.

537
00:47:54,164 --> 00:47:57,564
Are we done here? I've gotta take a crap.

538
00:48:00,129 --> 00:48:02,809
Wait a tic. Something doesn't smell right.

539
00:48:03,674 --> 00:48:05,474
And I think it's Fat Bastard.

540
00:48:23,947 --> 00:48:24,907
You okay, Austin?

541
00:48:24,990 --> 00:48:26,550
Sound as a pound, love.

542
00:48:29,829 --> 00:48:31,669
I didn't have any corn!

543
00:48:47,556 --> 00:48:50,796
Hey diaper-lady! Here's my diaper.

544
00:48:52,854 --> 00:48:54,934
I think I might have pinched one off to soon.

545
00:48:58,568 --> 00:49:00,448
I left a rosebud in there for you.

546
00:49:10,290 --> 00:49:12,770
You really are a fat bastard!

547
00:49:13,043 --> 00:49:16,163
You know, that hurts my feelings. I'm trying to go on a diet, you know.

548
00:49:16,756 --> 00:49:19,356
The zoan. You know curbs are the enemy.

549
00:49:23,137 --> 00:49:26,897
Oh...who's your friend?

550
00:49:28,519 --> 00:49:30,559
Oh, I liked to have a go with that filly.

551
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:33,260
Do you find me sexy?

552
00:49:34,609 --> 00:49:36,409
Look at my titties!

553
00:49:37,446 --> 00:49:38,366
Shut your mouth!

554
00:49:41,408 --> 00:49:42,648
Alright, that's enough!

555
00:49:43,326 --> 00:49:46,686
- Okay, you got me, put it there, would you?
- Okay.

556
00:49:52,462 --> 00:49:53,422
Come here, you!

557
00:49:54,422 --> 00:49:56,902
Oh, my titties!

558
00:49:57,593 --> 00:49:59,193
You give me a nipple!

559
00:50:04,725 --> 00:50:06,085
I've got you now!

560
00:50:07,853 --> 00:50:09,053
Come here you!

561
00:50:15,529 --> 00:50:18,969
Prepare for the ultimate wire-fighting manoeuvre!

562
00:50:20,534 --> 00:50:24,094
I just hope my wire-fighting team is ready!

563
00:50:43,685 --> 00:50:47,725
- Cranky!
- Oh, great, isn't this magical?

564
00:50:48,357 --> 00:50:49,757
One of my wires broke.

565
00:50:57,450 --> 00:50:58,610
Your under arrest, sugar!

566
00:51:01,372 --> 00:51:04,572
Okay, Fat Bastard, who's the Japanese cat you make a exchange with?

567
00:51:05,877 --> 00:51:08,917
All right. His name is Roboto.

568
00:51:09,630 --> 00:51:11,750
He owns Roboto Industries.

569
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:16,300
He's designing some contraption for Dr. Evil...I don't know...

570
00:51:16,764 --> 00:51:18,044
- The tractorbeam.
- The tractorbeam.

571
00:51:18,432 --> 00:51:19,152
That's it!

572
00:51:19,475 --> 00:51:22,515
Listen, do you honestly think that crime can pay?

573
00:51:23,396 --> 00:51:25,836
Well, to be honest with you, I've been trying to go legit.

574
00:51:26,858 --> 00:51:29,858
I really take my sumo wrestling seriously, you know.

575
00:51:31,154 --> 00:51:33,234
But when you are an overweight child.

576
00:51:34,408 --> 00:51:37,208
In this society that demands perfection.

577
00:51:39,038 --> 00:51:42,998
Like your sense of right, wrong, fair and unfair.

578
00:51:45,212 --> 00:51:47,812
We'll always be tragically scud.

579
00:51:54,055 --> 00:51:55,975
Did you just soil yourself?

580
00:51:56,808 --> 00:51:57,808
Maybe.

581
00:51:59,144 --> 00:52:02,384
It did sound a little wet, didn't it, right in the end, uhh...

582
00:52:03,398 --> 00:52:04,398
Let's have a smell, alright.

583
00:52:05,443 --> 00:52:07,403
Wafting, wafting.

584
00:52:07,529 --> 00:52:10,489
Well, everyone likes there own brand, don't they? This is magic!

585
00:52:11,366 --> 00:52:12,606
Alright, analysis.

586
00:52:13,743 --> 00:52:15,783
Smells like carrots and throw up.

587
00:52:16,830 --> 00:52:18,510
That could gag a maggot!

588
00:52:18,749 --> 00:52:22,829
Smells like hot, sick arse and a dead carcass.

589
00:52:24,339 --> 00:52:26,859
Even stink would say that that stinks!

590
00:52:27,592 --> 00:52:29,392
You know when you go to the apartment building, -

591
00:52:29,928 --> 00:52:32,328
- and you smell others people's cookin' on each floor, -

592
00:52:32,472 --> 00:52:33,832
- and you go: "What are they cookin'".

593
00:52:34,058 --> 00:52:35,658
That, plus crap!

594
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:46,900
- Hey pa!
- Hey Scotty! How you been sport...

595
00:52:49,408 --> 00:52:50,408
I got you a present.

596
00:52:50,910 --> 00:52:51,750
Really?

597
00:52:52,328 --> 00:52:53,048
Open the tank.

598
00:52:53,246 --> 00:52:54,006
Open the tank!

599
00:53:01,297 --> 00:53:04,697
Are those sharks with laserbeams attached to their heads?

600
00:53:09,597 --> 00:53:10,477
Cool!

601
00:53:10,974 --> 00:53:14,774
You mean I actually have fricken' sharks with fricken' laser beams
attached to their fricken' heads?

602
00:53:16,313 --> 00:53:17,873
You're the best evil son an evil dad could ever ask for.

603
00:53:22,153 --> 00:53:22,953
I love you, dad.

604
00:53:26,825 --> 00:53:27,785
I love you, son.

605
00:53:29,702 --> 00:53:30,342
Starting moment...

606
00:53:31,163 --> 00:53:33,083
Scotty! Come here.

607
00:53:34,625 --> 00:53:36,545
Pop a squat, right next to daddy!

608
00:53:39,255 --> 00:53:42,615
Mini-Me, move down the bench.

609
00:53:46,054 --> 00:53:47,054
There's a power struggle.

610
00:53:52,979 --> 00:53:54,699
Scotty's on fire!

611
00:53:57,066 --> 00:53:58,786
Alright, it's getting crowded in here.

612
00:53:59,027 --> 00:54:00,907
Everyone out, everyone out, come on!

613
00:54:01,571 --> 00:54:02,291
Not you, Scotty.

614
00:54:02,531 --> 00:54:03,331
Not you, Number 2.

615
00:54:03,532 --> 00:54:04,132
Not you, Frau.

616
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:05,080
Not you, Goldmember.

617
00:54:05,534 --> 00:54:06,774
Not you guys back there.

618
00:54:07,161 --> 00:54:08,761
Not you henchman holding wrench.

619
00:54:09,497 --> 00:54:13,217
Not you henchman arbitrarily turning knobs making it seam like your doing something.

620
00:54:26,516 --> 00:54:27,756
This is uncomfortable!

621
00:54:28,936 --> 00:54:30,536
The tiny one can't take a hint.

622
00:54:32,564 --> 00:54:34,644
He doesn't understand, He's small.

623
00:54:52,962 --> 00:54:54,802
Hello Foxxy. Austin.

624
00:54:55,047 --> 00:54:58,247
We've comfirmed what Fat Bastard told you about Roboto is accurate.

625
00:54:58,676 --> 00:55:01,676
He was hired by Dr. Evil to contruct Preparation H.

626
00:55:02,556 --> 00:55:05,796
So Roboto had the technology to build Goldmember's tractorbeam.

627
00:55:06,435 --> 00:55:08,355
Which means Roboto will lead us to Goldmember.

628
00:55:08,479 --> 00:55:10,479
Which means Goldmember will lead us to my father.

629
00:55:32,422 --> 00:55:34,462
- You speak Japanese?
- A little.

630
00:55:34,675 --> 00:55:37,555
Well you might be a cunning linguist, but I'm a master debator.

631
00:55:41,265 --> 00:55:43,185
I'm looking for my father. He was kidnapped.

632
00:55:48,857 --> 00:55:50,217
Please eat what?

633
00:55:50,901 --> 00:55:56,301
Wait. He said: "Please eat some shitake mushrooms."

634
00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:07,320
Tell me. What do you know about...s...my father's where...about...s.

635
00:56:14,094 --> 00:56:15,934
You're ass is happy?

636
00:56:16,471 --> 00:56:17,711
No!

637
00:56:20,058 --> 00:56:23,258
He said: "Your assignment is an unhappy one".

638
00:56:27,692 --> 00:56:29,252
Nice potty-mouth, dirtbag.

639
00:56:35,617 --> 00:56:38,657
Yes. Quite off topic, thank you very much.

640
00:56:39,079 --> 00:56:40,799
Why don't I just speak in English?

641
00:56:42,583 --> 00:56:44,303
That would be a good idea, now wouldn't it?

642
00:56:44,752 --> 00:56:46,432
That way I wouldn't miss-read the subtitles -

643
00:56:46,546 --> 00:56:48,826
- making you it seem like you're saying that are dirty.

644
00:56:50,425 --> 00:56:53,185
I'm sorry to hear about your father. But I can't help you.

645
00:56:55,347 --> 00:56:55,987
Please excuse me.

646
00:56:56,474 --> 00:56:57,314
I have another appointment.

647
00:57:03,648 --> 00:57:04,488
By the way...

648
00:57:10,405 --> 00:57:11,805
Mr. Roboto is lying to us.

649
00:57:12,450 --> 00:57:13,610
Tell me something I don't know.

650
00:57:13,701 --> 00:57:15,021
I open-mouth kissed a horse once.

651
00:57:15,620 --> 00:57:17,140
- Say-what?
- That's something you don't know.

652
00:57:17,706 --> 00:57:20,226
My spider-senses tells me that my father is still in this building.

653
00:57:20,917 --> 00:57:23,157
You keep a look out. I'm gonna try to sneak in.

654
00:59:34,566 --> 00:59:35,366
Sha-zam!

655
00:59:36,609 --> 00:59:37,289
Come on, sugar.

656
00:59:43,158 --> 00:59:44,518
There is Goldmember and Roboto.

657
00:59:44,619 --> 00:59:48,659
Yesh. Very impressive put Preparation H into my stooping transporten.

658
00:59:53,128 --> 00:59:54,968
You need this to tone the tractorbeam.

659
00:59:55,464 --> 00:59:56,424
It's a gold key.

660
00:59:59,427 --> 01:00:00,147
Smarty pants.

661
01:00:00,970 --> 01:00:01,650
Let's spread out.

662
01:00:07,518 --> 01:00:08,558
Hands up, Goldmember!

663
01:00:08,895 --> 01:00:09,975
It's payback time.

664
01:00:11,523 --> 01:00:12,723
Sure you can kill me.

665
01:00:12,817 --> 01:00:16,417
But then, what happens to Austin Powers' fassia?

666
01:00:25,289 --> 01:00:26,089
Dad!

667
01:00:26,165 --> 01:00:29,525
Yesh! And now he's going to have an unfortunate smelting accident.

668
01:00:39,262 --> 01:00:41,622
Don't worry dad! I'm here to rescue you.

669
01:00:42,766 --> 01:00:45,966
May I point out, that last time around you fell into to an obvious trap.

670
01:00:46,270 --> 01:00:48,630
Now your're trying to save me instead of stopping Goldmember.

671
01:00:48,773 --> 01:00:51,253
Please, I'm not gonna let Goldmember get away!

672
01:00:51,943 --> 01:00:53,583
Austin, Goldmember is getting away.

673
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:03,280
Hello, hello, aren't you gonna introduce us Austin?

674
01:01:04,123 --> 01:01:04,843
Foxxy, this is...

675
01:01:04,915 --> 01:01:06,355
Powers. Nigel Powers.

676
01:01:07,460 --> 01:01:09,220
Is that Eau de Fleuratia your wearing?

677
01:01:09,588 --> 01:01:10,308
Yes, it is.

678
01:01:11,173 --> 01:01:12,493
That's how a woman should smell.

679
01:01:13,300 --> 01:01:14,740
Especially one as beautiful as you.

680
01:01:15,135 --> 01:01:18,855
My my...even in the face of danger you live up to your reputation.

681
01:01:21,935 --> 01:01:22,735
Get on with it!

682
01:01:27,441 --> 01:01:28,441
I got an idea.

683
01:01:33,822 --> 01:01:35,302
Your spycar is a mini.

684
01:01:35,491 --> 01:01:36,531
It's not the size mate.

685
01:01:37,326 --> 01:01:38,366
It's how you use it.

686
01:02:01,979 --> 01:02:03,819
You know I would have found my way out, very well.

687
01:02:04,148 --> 01:02:05,788
What? I saved your life!

688
01:02:05,900 --> 01:02:06,300
Listen.

689
01:02:06,358 --> 01:02:07,398
Should have been doing your job!

690
01:02:07,485 --> 01:02:08,605
Oh, your welcome, mate.

691
01:02:08,694 --> 01:02:10,294
Shut up and turn around, please!

692
01:02:38,936 --> 01:02:41,616
Run! It's Godzilla!

693
01:02:41,773 --> 01:02:42,893
It looks like Godzilla.

694
01:02:42,983 --> 01:02:45,223
But due to International Copyright Laws...it's not.

695
01:02:45,652 --> 01:02:47,772
Still we should run, like it is Godzilla!

696
01:02:48,280 --> 01:02:48,880
Though it isn't.

697
01:02:55,080 --> 01:02:55,920
There is Goldmember.

698
01:03:03,047 --> 01:03:06,607
Greater-greater one-niner, this is Goldie-van. Over.

699
01:03:07,093 --> 01:03:10,733
10-4 there, Goldie-van this is Rubber-ducky, what's your ten-twenty? Over.

700
01:03:11,389 --> 01:03:16,989
I've got Preparation H in rear and smoke
in the barrel of my backdoor... Viva las convoy. Over.

701
01:03:17,646 --> 01:03:20,846
Yee-haa. Copy that you son-of-a-bitch powder of monkeynuts.

702
01:03:22,193 --> 01:03:25,913
Open wide there Rubber-ducky, I'm entering your mouth now. Over.

703
01:03:33,872 --> 01:03:35,592
Great, Goldmember got away.

704
01:03:36,250 --> 01:03:36,770
Now what?

705
01:03:37,084 --> 01:03:40,044
I think it's obvious, we should take Dr. Evil's lair by force.

706
01:03:40,213 --> 01:03:42,333
- You can be my backup, son.
- Backup?

707
01:03:42,882 --> 01:03:44,362
Well that's fairly condescending.

708
01:03:44,842 --> 01:03:47,042
Do you think Dr. Evil's is gonna expect an attack?

709
01:03:47,178 --> 01:03:48,818
We should infiltrate his lair.

710
01:03:49,223 --> 01:03:51,703
It's aint my first rodeo, cowboy.

711
01:03:51,976 --> 01:03:55,536
We need commandos, scuba...gadgets for god-sake.

712
01:03:56,105 --> 01:03:57,625
Well, I don't like to use gadgets.

713
01:03:58,608 --> 01:04:00,688
Outside the bedroom, I thank you...

714
01:04:04,990 --> 01:04:07,990
You know. I think being frozen, damaged your brain.

715
01:04:09,204 --> 01:04:10,964
Really? And how would you know?

716
01:04:11,747 --> 01:04:16,387
This is the most time we ever spent together, since...ever!

717
01:04:17,171 --> 01:04:18,411
What are you saying, son?

718
01:04:19,631 --> 01:04:21,991
What boy learned to drive a car with machineguns on it?

719
01:04:22,552 --> 01:04:24,472
Or had a helicopter you could fit in a nutsack?

720
01:04:25,763 --> 01:04:27,723
What about you Swedish nanny, Helga?

721
01:04:29,184 --> 01:04:30,464
Oh, yes, Helga!

722
01:04:30,561 --> 01:04:32,241
Let's say I didn't hire her for the cooking.

723
01:04:33,939 --> 01:04:35,659
She stayed on, until you were 24.

724
01:04:37,609 --> 01:04:38,929
We were mates you and I.

725
01:04:39,237 --> 01:04:40,437
I didn't need a friend.

726
01:04:41,197 --> 01:04:42,437
I needed a father.

727
01:04:43,449 --> 01:04:45,529
You know I have risked my life trying to save you.

728
01:04:45,660 --> 01:04:47,940
And you still don't give me any respect.

729
01:04:48,330 --> 01:04:50,130
Respect? Come on.

730
01:04:50,541 --> 01:04:52,781
If you got an issue, here's your tissue.

731
01:05:00,635 --> 01:05:02,955
That is not funny.

732
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:06,760
Well, I suppose we better go our seperate ways then?

733
01:05:09,061 --> 01:05:09,981
Fine.

734
01:05:13,524 --> 01:05:14,524
Fine.

735
01:05:26,205 --> 01:05:29,285
So. I've been assigned to welcome you to the Ministry of Defense.

736
01:05:29,584 --> 01:05:32,304
I have a letter from my director personally thanking you for switching sides.

737
01:05:39,679 --> 01:05:43,119
I...can't wait to inform Austin of your defection.

738
01:05:48,438 --> 01:05:49,678
Oh. Hello Basil.

739
01:05:50,482 --> 01:05:51,762
Yes, Austin should be here any second.

740
01:05:53,944 --> 01:05:55,384
Yes, I'm in Austin's hotel room right now.

741
01:06:04,874 --> 01:06:05,834
Assasin!

742
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:11,160
Try to kill me will ya?

743
01:06:14,634 --> 01:06:16,314
Oh. You wanna be friends, huh?

744
01:06:18,055 --> 01:06:19,135
Wait a tick.

745
01:06:23,853 --> 01:06:25,333
I'm not falling for that again!

746
01:06:35,240 --> 01:06:36,400
But, at least he didn't mention it.

747
01:06:37,492 --> 01:06:38,612
Yes, I realize he can't talk.

748
01:06:40,162 --> 01:06:41,922
Listen I think Dr. Evil treated him badly.

749
01:06:42,039 --> 01:06:43,519
And that's why he has decided to help us.

750
01:06:49,965 --> 01:06:51,445
Come back here, you little bugger.

751
01:06:57,598 --> 01:06:59,798
Oh, yes. I'm sure Austin and Mini-Me, will get along famously.

752
01:07:01,979 --> 01:07:04,099
I guarantee nothing will happen to Mini-Me in my watch.

753
01:07:09,361 --> 01:07:11,521
Come here you bugger, I got ya.

754
01:07:16,536 --> 01:07:17,776
Oh, I think he and Austin will be united -

755
01:07:17,870 --> 01:07:20,230
- in their commitment to the mission of stopping Dr. Evil.

756
01:07:26,005 --> 01:07:27,485
Austin. There you are.

757
01:07:27,840 --> 01:07:28,880
I have come to tell you the good news.

758
01:07:33,721 --> 01:07:34,561
Mini-Me has...

759
01:07:36,475 --> 01:07:37,195
- switched sides.

760
01:07:41,355 --> 01:07:42,675
Sorry about that, old chap.

761
01:07:45,652 --> 01:07:46,532
Welcome aboard.

762
01:07:48,321 --> 01:07:49,241
My mole-stake.

763
01:07:50,199 --> 01:07:50,799
What was that?

764
01:07:51,992 --> 01:07:53,992
Listen. Just get it out of you system.

765
01:07:54,119 --> 01:07:55,799
- No I'm fine.
- I insist.

766
01:07:55,913 --> 01:07:57,193
We could work together better if you just...

767
01:07:57,289 --> 01:07:58,009
Mole!

768
01:07:58,083 --> 01:07:59,163
Bloody mole!

769
01:07:59,250 --> 01:08:01,010
We are not supposed to talk about the bloody mole, -

770
01:08:01,127 --> 01:08:03,327
- but there's a bloody mole winking me in the face!

771
01:08:03,589 --> 01:08:05,269
I'm gonna chop it off, and cut it off.

772
01:08:05,382 --> 01:08:07,182
And make some guacamole!

773
01:08:09,845 --> 01:08:10,725
- Better?
- Yeah.

774
01:08:26,405 --> 01:08:28,685
So you decided to join us, huh, Mini-Me?

775
01:08:29,909 --> 01:08:31,669
And welcome to the good side, my mini-brother.

776
01:08:32,245 --> 01:08:33,925
And thank you for the map for Dr. Evil's sub.

777
01:08:36,750 --> 01:08:37,510
What's this?

778
01:08:37,584 --> 01:08:40,304
It says: "Dr. Evil's tractorbeam is now complete" -

779
01:08:40,463 --> 01:08:43,583
- "there is not much time. Dr. Evil must pay!"

780
01:08:48,430 --> 01:08:49,510
"You are so beautiful."

781
01:08:50,432 --> 01:08:51,952
"Are you a clone of an angel?"

782
01:08:53,059 --> 01:08:54,979
That is so sweet!

783
01:08:55,562 --> 01:08:57,282
But no my mini-man, I'm not.

784
01:09:00,318 --> 01:09:02,438
"Are you sure you don't have a little clone in you?"

785
01:09:03,989 --> 01:09:04,749
Yeah I'm sure.

786
01:09:05,531 --> 01:09:06,331
"Would you like to...?"

787
01:09:10,454 --> 01:09:11,534
Holy bugger!

788
01:09:12,581 --> 01:09:13,861
That is so not funny.

789
01:09:15,584 --> 01:09:17,224
Okay, everyone prepare to dive.

790
01:09:17,587 --> 01:09:19,507
This spycar is also a submarine.

791
01:09:35,482 --> 01:09:37,282
Get me the World Organization.

792
01:09:40,237 --> 01:09:41,317
What is it, Dr. Evil?

793
01:09:41,655 --> 01:09:46,455
Gentlemen. In a matter of hours a meteor will crash into Earth causing a global flood.

794
01:09:46,869 --> 01:09:49,229
That is of course unless you pay me.

795
01:09:51,166 --> 01:09:57,606
1 billion-gezillion-fefillion...-

796
01:09:58,549 --> 01:10:00,669
- million...yen.

797
01:10:00,927 --> 01:10:02,007
I think you're bluffing.

798
01:10:02,887 --> 01:10:06,247
Well perhaps you would like a demonstration? Number 2 the key, please.

799
01:10:28,749 --> 01:10:30,789
Sir, Dr. Evil is not bluffing.

800
01:10:31,169 --> 01:10:32,849
One of our satellites is falling out of orbit.

801
01:10:33,254 --> 01:10:33,854
Which one?

802
01:10:34,172 --> 01:10:35,492
It's the one that looks like a pair of...

803
01:10:35,590 --> 01:10:38,870
Melons! Big juicy melons!

804
01:10:39,470 --> 01:10:40,870
Are they nice and ferm?

805
01:10:41,639 --> 01:10:42,599
Well, what do you think?

806
01:10:43,390 --> 01:10:44,190
Look at that!

807
01:10:44,475 --> 01:10:45,955
It looks like a set of giant...

808
01:10:48,146 --> 01:10:50,506
Hey, A and N you're late. How're we doin..

809
01:10:52,025 --> 01:10:56,545
Go Titans! Check it out. Those remind me of...

810
01:10:57,156 --> 01:10:57,956
Boobs!

811
01:10:58,699 --> 01:10:59,459
Boobs, Ozzy?

812
01:10:59,783 --> 01:11:02,503
These film makers is just *BEEP* boobs!

813
01:11:03,245 --> 01:11:04,245
What do you mean, dad?

814
01:11:04,455 --> 01:11:08,295
Well they use the same *BEEP* jokes, as they did in the last Austin Powers movie.

815
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:10,280
What *BEEP* joke?

816
01:11:10,671 --> 01:11:13,991
You know the *BEEP* joke about the long smooth rocket that looks likes some guy's...

817
01:11:14,175 --> 01:11:14,695
Johnson!

818
01:11:15,634 --> 01:11:17,114
- Yes, sir?
- Any sign of that satellite?

819
01:11:18,095 --> 01:11:19,495
No, sir. It's gone.

820
01:11:19,889 --> 01:11:22,609
Gentlemen, you have my demands, peace out!

821
01:11:58,181 --> 01:12:01,301
Cool, baby. You look very switched on.

822
01:12:02,186 --> 01:12:03,146
Thank you, Austin.

823
01:12:07,066 --> 01:12:10,026
No Mini-Me! Off! Bad! No humping!

824
01:12:12,906 --> 01:12:15,386
Dr. Evil. In light of success of the device.

825
01:12:15,785 --> 01:12:18,025
It is japanese custom that I recieve a bonus.

826
01:12:19,789 --> 01:12:20,749
A bonus?

827
01:12:21,458 --> 01:12:23,058
That's good. Yeah.

828
01:12:24,711 --> 01:12:26,111
Throw me a freakin' bonus here!

829
01:12:30,050 --> 01:12:32,570
I haven't laughed that hard since I was a little girl, thank you!

830
01:12:34,347 --> 01:12:36,267
Oh, you're nok joking.

831
01:12:36,975 --> 01:12:39,095
No! In fact if you don't give me the bonus...

832
01:12:39,227 --> 01:12:41,187
- Hey guys!
- Hey Scotty, how are you, sport?

833
01:12:49,655 --> 01:12:51,375
- Why don't you let me take care of this?
- Okay.

834
01:13:04,505 --> 01:13:05,545
That's the evil laugh.

835
01:13:08,885 --> 01:13:09,485
Scotty!

836
01:13:10,803 --> 01:13:11,843
Scotty!

837
01:13:13,640 --> 01:13:16,320
Scotty. Take it down a notch.

838
01:13:19,105 --> 01:13:20,025
It's creepin' a bit.

839
01:13:20,690 --> 01:13:21,290
Let's go.

840
01:13:26,654 --> 01:13:27,694
We will need a disguise.

841
01:13:29,533 --> 01:13:30,853
There's only one uniform.

842
01:13:31,994 --> 01:13:33,994
One of us has to go, on the other one's shoulders.

843
01:13:48,011 --> 01:13:49,131
Hey there buddy how's it going?

844
01:13:49,221 --> 01:13:50,141
Good to see, ya.

845
01:13:51,057 --> 01:13:52,777
Yeah, yeah...hi!

846
01:13:58,189 --> 01:13:59,269
Hello. You alright?

847
01:13:59,650 --> 01:14:01,490
Yes it's a good hat. Very good hat.

848
01:14:03,737 --> 01:14:04,897
Come on Mini-Me, let's go.

849
01:14:07,032 --> 01:14:08,552
Hold it right there, mister.

850
01:14:11,788 --> 01:14:13,708
Did you really think that you could get away with this?

851
01:14:15,208 --> 01:14:16,728
I did actually, yes.

852
01:14:17,419 --> 01:14:19,419
Every new recruit must have a physical.

853
01:14:20,464 --> 01:14:21,584
Now get in here sailor.

854
01:14:22,425 --> 01:14:24,465
I'm going to need an urine sample.

855
01:14:27,180 --> 01:14:28,060
Okay.

856
01:14:35,690 --> 01:14:36,530
Okay, then.

857
01:14:54,001 --> 01:14:54,681
Hello.

858
01:15:01,677 --> 01:15:03,117
And here we go.

859
01:15:11,271 --> 01:15:12,231
- Terrific.
- Yes.

860
01:15:14,190 --> 01:15:19,190
Alright sailor. Go behind that screen and strip down to your skippies.

861
01:15:20,197 --> 01:15:22,237
Alright then, I'll just go to that screen.

862
01:15:24,368 --> 01:15:26,008
Which is over there.

863
01:15:30,834 --> 01:15:31,994
Right behind that screen.

864
01:15:37,133 --> 01:15:38,853
Come on, hurry the map.

865
01:15:39,843 --> 01:15:40,763
Okay, what's on the map.

866
01:15:43,932 --> 01:15:45,812
I'm going to need an urine sample.

867
01:15:46,726 --> 01:15:48,206
Which way to the main chamber?

868
01:16:07,124 --> 01:16:09,644
Okay. So...sure.

869
01:16:22,058 --> 01:16:22,938
Excuse me, doctor?

870
01:16:23,434 --> 01:16:24,714
It's difficult in public, isn't it?

871
01:16:33,487 --> 01:16:35,847
Mini-Me, our shadows, we're casting a shadow.

872
01:16:36,114 --> 01:16:36,954
What's wrong, sailor?

873
01:16:38,116 --> 01:16:39,396
You should check that guy out!

874
01:16:46,376 --> 01:16:47,736
What the hell is going on here?

875
01:16:51,215 --> 01:16:51,735
Hands up.

876
01:16:54,594 --> 01:16:55,874
You heard me, I said hands up!

877
01:16:56,596 --> 01:16:57,516
Both of you!

878
01:17:10,361 --> 01:17:11,121
Come with me!

879
01:17:11,488 --> 01:17:12,528
Mini-Me, the map. Go!

880
01:17:15,784 --> 01:17:17,384
Okay, you got me.

881
01:17:29,382 --> 01:17:30,822
Are you alright, little man?

882
01:17:35,347 --> 01:17:35,987
Right on!

883
01:17:53,534 --> 01:17:54,774
Mr. Powers.

884
01:17:55,619 --> 01:18:00,099
Before I kill you. Perhaps you would like to see the genius of my plan.

885
01:18:02,878 --> 01:18:03,838
Key, please.

886
01:18:08,384 --> 01:18:11,184
What the? Who? But how? Where?

887
01:18:14,015 --> 01:18:14,815
Looking for this?

888
01:18:17,811 --> 01:18:18,611
Mini-Me?

889
01:18:18,978 --> 01:18:21,178
Alright, everybody, drop your guns.

890
01:18:21,439 --> 01:18:23,559
Because Foxxy Cleopatra is in the sub.

891
01:18:23,984 --> 01:18:26,504
Smashing, Foxxy! Yeah!

892
01:18:31,868 --> 01:18:33,028
Alright, Dr. Evil.

893
01:18:33,870 --> 01:18:35,510
It has finally come down to this.

894
01:18:36,998 --> 01:18:40,118
You, me and the gun.

895
01:18:43,214 --> 01:18:44,614
What are you going to do now, Austin?

896
01:18:47,469 --> 01:18:48,309
Dad?

897
01:18:49,262 --> 01:18:50,622
What are you doing here?

898
01:18:51,807 --> 01:18:54,167
I gotta finish this off once and for all.

899
01:18:56,520 --> 01:18:57,880
I'm afraid you can't do that.

900
01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:00,800
I have to protect my son.

901
01:19:01,401 --> 01:19:02,481
Dad, I'm fine.

902
01:19:03,528 --> 01:19:04,728
I'm not talking about you.

903
01:19:06,531 --> 01:19:08,571
I'm talking about...him.

904
01:19:12,664 --> 01:19:13,424
What?

905
01:19:14,582 --> 01:19:16,142
Dr. Evil is not your son.

906
01:19:16,334 --> 01:19:17,214
I am.

907
01:19:18,337 --> 01:19:23,217
You both are.

908
01:19:23,467 --> 01:19:24,387
What?

909
01:19:24,468 --> 01:19:26,868
It was our first...family holiday together.

910
01:19:28,264 --> 01:19:29,864
Just as I was finishing a case.

911
01:19:30,684 --> 01:19:32,484
Your mother brought the two of you to Belgium.

912
01:19:36,523 --> 01:19:37,643
I stopped to have a tinkle.

913
01:19:38,566 --> 01:19:39,246
When the car...

914
01:19:50,581 --> 01:19:54,501
But, my parents died in a car accident.

915
01:19:55,127 --> 01:19:56,767
It was no accident.

916
01:19:57,629 --> 01:19:59,189
t was an assasination attempt.

917
01:20:00,132 --> 01:20:01,772
I though only Austin survived.

918
01:20:02,677 --> 01:20:04,517
I should have told you the truth earlier.

919
01:20:04,930 --> 01:20:08,530
But those Belgians, they made you so damn...evil.

920
01:20:10,436 --> 01:20:13,756
Of course they share border with Dutch.

921
01:20:15,233 --> 01:20:17,953
Very interesting story, Mr. Powers.

922
01:20:19,070 --> 01:20:21,910
Of course, I'm gonna have to wait until I see all the facts.

923
01:20:22,449 --> 01:20:23,489
Daddy!

924
01:20:27,288 --> 01:20:28,008
Daddy is here, Ducky.

925
01:20:29,582 --> 01:20:31,302
Ducky, ducky?

926
01:20:31,542 --> 01:20:32,942
Ducky remember, Ducky...?

927
01:20:33,044 --> 01:20:34,404
Dad, what's going on?

928
01:20:38,550 --> 01:20:39,830
What are you going to do Austin?

929
01:20:53,900 --> 01:20:54,780
Austin!

930
01:20:55,611 --> 01:20:57,411
Are you sure you can trust, Dr. Evil?

931
01:20:58,948 --> 01:21:00,428
He ain't heavy.

932
01:21:02,076 --> 01:21:04,516
He's my brother, baby, yeah!

933
01:21:07,290 --> 01:21:09,210
I should have told you this so long ago, son.

934
01:21:11,086 --> 01:21:12,286
I'm very proud of you.

935
01:21:14,674 --> 01:21:15,474
Can you forgive me?

936
01:21:16,175 --> 01:21:17,095
I forgive you dad.

937
01:21:42,287 --> 01:21:44,807
I'm Ducky! I'm Ducky!

938
01:21:58,514 --> 01:22:00,434
Oh, come on!

939
01:22:01,267 --> 01:22:03,307
I mean first I'm not evil enough for you.

940
01:22:03,978 --> 01:22:05,618
And now you're gonna turn good?

941
01:22:06,398 --> 01:22:07,358
Listen, Scott.

942
01:22:08,066 --> 01:22:09,426
You can spend your whole life -

943
01:22:09,526 --> 01:22:12,566
- trying to win your parents acceptance. Believe me!

944
01:22:13,697 --> 01:22:16,697
But at the end of the day you just gotta do it for yourself, baby.

945
01:22:18,869 --> 01:22:19,669
Hey, Austin...

946
01:22:21,122 --> 01:22:21,842
What?

947
01:22:22,707 --> 01:22:23,467
I hate you.

948
01:22:24,751 --> 01:22:25,711
I hate you!

949
01:22:26,587 --> 01:22:27,467
I hate you!

950
01:22:28,589 --> 01:22:30,829
I don't even know you, but I hate you too.

951
01:22:31,634 --> 01:22:33,474
And I especially hate you!

952
01:22:36,389 --> 01:22:37,109
You'll pay.

953
01:22:38,266 --> 01:22:39,546
You'll all pay!

954
01:22:43,897 --> 01:22:47,217
I'd like to point out that no one else in my gene pool runs like a girl.

955
01:22:48,277 --> 01:22:50,437
Not so fast, smarty pants!

956
01:22:51,447 --> 01:22:52,487
Dr. Evil!

957
01:22:53,158 --> 01:22:55,158
You might not want to destroy the world.

958
01:22:55,410 --> 01:22:57,370
But I do!

959
01:22:59,289 --> 01:23:01,929
Preparation H goes ahead as planned.

960
01:23:02,335 --> 01:23:04,015
I got to flood the Earth!

961
01:23:05,380 --> 01:23:06,500
Think again, Goldmember.

962
01:23:07,131 --> 01:23:09,011
Huh, Foxxy Cleopatra.

963
01:23:09,509 --> 01:23:11,429
It's a shame I had to kill your partner.

964
01:23:12,012 --> 01:23:15,412
- Too bad for you.
- Too bad for me?

965
01:23:16,350 --> 01:23:17,910
How about too bad for you?

966
01:23:18,644 --> 01:23:19,564
Oh no!

967
01:23:26,570 --> 01:23:28,130
Luckily I keep a spare.

968
01:23:36,581 --> 01:23:39,661
Look everyone! My winky was a key!

969
01:23:40,252 --> 01:23:41,732
Oh dear, bloody Dutchman.

970
01:23:48,886 --> 01:23:50,046
Foxxy, I'm coming!

971
01:23:51,055 --> 01:23:54,455
Don't do anything stupid or the shooting begins.

972
01:23:54,643 --> 01:23:58,123
Austin, take Ducky I'll stay here and be your backup.

973
01:23:58,855 --> 01:23:59,935
Ducky, what do we do?

974
01:24:00,775 --> 01:24:03,415
I'm not really a "hands-on-evil-genius".

975
01:24:03,987 --> 01:24:05,907
Think you were always the smart one.

976
01:24:06,614 --> 01:24:10,454
I could re-write the output capacity to the tractorbeam -

977
01:24:10,661 --> 01:24:12,501
- from one of the conduit boxes up there.

978
01:24:13,204 --> 01:24:13,924
Come on, let's go.

979
01:24:20,588 --> 01:24:22,228
Yesh! The shooting begins.

980
01:24:26,553 --> 01:24:27,593
Let me shoot!

981
01:24:33,519 --> 01:24:36,639
You know, Dr. Evil. I used to think you were crazy.

982
01:24:37,231 --> 01:24:37,871
I know.

983
01:24:38,232 --> 01:24:40,832
But now I can see your nuts. I thank you.

984
01:24:59,506 --> 01:25:00,266
Hurry!

985
01:25:04,345 --> 01:25:06,985
Fassia, fassia, fassia, fassia, fassia.

986
01:25:07,139 --> 01:25:09,299
Fassia can you here me?

987
01:25:09,642 --> 01:25:10,802
Fassia, fassia...

988
01:25:21,697 --> 01:25:23,177
Well done, Austin!

989
01:25:23,700 --> 01:25:25,340
You saved the world again.

990
01:25:28,163 --> 01:25:28,763
Thank you.

991
01:25:31,125 --> 01:25:33,325
Austin, you did it.

992
01:25:33,502 --> 01:25:34,302
We did it!

993
01:25:34,629 --> 01:25:35,909
Yeah, baby!

994
01:25:38,841 --> 01:25:40,801
No? Just trying it on.

995
01:25:43,388 --> 01:25:46,308
Goldmember, you're under arrest, sugar.

996
01:25:49,895 --> 01:25:55,935
Hey assholes! Do I have time for a last smoke and a pancake or what?

997
01:26:00,865 --> 01:26:04,065
I'm from Holland! Isn't that wierd?

998
01:26:09,041 --> 01:26:10,841
Yes, well done!

999
01:26:37,281 --> 01:26:38,801
Hey Powers!

1000
01:26:41,912 --> 01:26:43,112
Fat Bastard?

1001
01:26:44,081 --> 01:26:45,441
But you are not fat anymore.

1002
01:26:45,999 --> 01:26:47,479
I'm on the subway diet.

1003
01:26:49,587 --> 01:26:51,507
I've lost a 180 pounds.

1004
01:26:52,048 --> 01:26:53,448
Congratulations, baby.

1005
01:26:53,674 --> 01:26:54,594
Thank you.

1006
01:26:54,675 --> 01:26:57,195
I do have a little bit of excess skin though.

1007
01:26:59,389 --> 01:27:02,309
But unfortunately my neck does look like a vagina.

1008
01:27:17,325 --> 01:27:17,885
Austin.

1009
01:27:19,327 --> 01:27:21,447
Thank you, for eveything.

1010
01:27:30,506 --> 01:27:31,626
Sha-zam!

1011
01:27:44,021 --> 01:27:45,901
I'm gonna get you, Austin Powers.

1012
01:28:08,966 --> 01:28:12,526
MORE TO COME...

1013
01:28:18,977 --> 01:28:20,857
Well they are using the same *BEEP* joke -

1014
01:28:20,979 --> 01:28:24,619
- as they used in the last Austin Powers film...movie...oh I'm sorry.

1015
01:28:25,359 --> 01:28:26,679
Well they are using the...the...what...

1016
01:28:27,028 --> 01:28:28,748
Well they are using the same joke, as they...

1017
01:28:31,449 --> 01:28:32,049
W...what do you mean?

1018
01:28:33,869 --> 01:28:34,789
Boobs, Ozzy?

1019
01:28:35,537 --> 01:28:36,217
Stop...

1020
01:28:38,999 --> 01:28:41,319
Oh, don't start this Kelly, don't you worry about...

1021
01:28:44,756 --> 01:28:45,356
On the mark!

1022
01:28:45,424 --> 01:28:45,984
On the mark?

1023
01:28:46,925 --> 01:28:49,205
I don't like that noise I'm getting all turned on.

1024
01:28:50,095 --> 01:28:52,055
My testeron is going dancing...

1025
01:28:53,766 --> 01:28:54,606
Get off me!

1026
01:28:59,689 --> 01:29:01,529
Is...is it true what they say about you?

1027
01:29:05,862 --> 01:29:10,942
Kickstand? Really? Can I give you my cellphone number?

1028
01:29:12,494 --> 01:29:13,294
Please?

1029
01:29:16,082 --> 01:29:18,482
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Burt Bacharach.
