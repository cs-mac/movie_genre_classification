1
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,310
Doctor.

2
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,557
No!

3
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,396
Doctor.

4
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,588
I thought I wouldn't make it.

5
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:40,749
Your briefcase.

6
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,872
You left it on your desk.

7
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,269
- Are RenoI's papers here?
- Yes.

8
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,436
Don't forget tonight's dinner party.

9
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,071
The class at the University
is tomorrow at 11.

10
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,157
The lecture's in the afternoon.

11
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,159
Please keep warm, and rest.

12
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,670
If there's anything you need...

13
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:06,756
I'm okay.

14
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,669
Doctor!

15
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,039
I wanted to tell you that...

16
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,672
you have nothing to worry about.

17
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,238
I know you don't like to
leave your office unattended.

18
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,355
It's not unattended.

19
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,839
Can I help you?

20
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,032
- Do I know you?
- I don't think so.

21
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,990
All old passengers look alike.

22
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,111
Are you going to the convention?

23
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,555
You too?

24
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,432
I'm going to a party!

25
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,318
Where were you?

26
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,478
In the cafeteria.

27
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,352
Were you drinking?

28
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,639
You stink!

29
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,959
Would you hold this?

30
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,872
I'm going to the bathroom.

31
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,958
I'll be right back.

32
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,317
Are you sure there's no one else?

33
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,028
I'm sure.

34
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:29,070
She couldn't leave without her case.

35
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,629
I've checked each and every car.

36
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,318
And the washrooms?

37
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,991
- Maybe something happened to her.
- Check the cafeteria.

38
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,395
Your mother may be
waiting for you there.

39
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:46,552
- No, she's not my mother.
- Then why worry so much?

40
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,353
I'm sorry.

41
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,076
Doctor?

42
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,599
Dr. Fausto?

43
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,589
Do I know you?

44
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,155
Dr. Fausto, it's you.
What a pleasure!

45
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,199
You don't remember?

46
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,592
You don't remember me?

47
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,559
Well, you should.

48
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,877
You removed my stomach.

49
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,270
Santos.
Santos Vella.

50
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,275
At El ProvinciaI, 8 years ago.

51
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,034
Pancreatic cancer.

52
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,080
A mixed tumor, with complications.

53
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:49,989
No?

54
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,353
Without the oxygen mask...

55
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,551
- Did I attend to you?
- You said I was terminaI.

56
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,115
We had a rather intense relationship.

57
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,830
But you operated 5 times first.

58
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,309
The last time, to show some
students an irreversible process.

59
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,075
- It seems I was wrong.
- It seems.

60
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,392
You said 3 months,
and it's been 8 years.

61
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,395
Don't apologize.
These things happen.

62
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,512
- I'm not.
- As I said, these things happen.

63
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,789
My stomach?

64
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,473
- What?
- My stomach.

65
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,078
- Your stomach?
- Yes. Did you keep it?

66
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:31,035
- What for?
- What became of it?

67
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,436
They threw it away, I guess.

68
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,472
In the garbage?

69
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,639
That's not too cooI.

70
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,199
You want us to keep it after 8 years?

71
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,877
Of course not.
I'd like to have seen it.

72
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,070
I'm sure it didn't look too good.

73
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,035
How'd you do it?

74
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,838
- What?
- This.

75
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,755
Live.

76
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,278
Staying away from hospitals.

77
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,835
When I see one,
I cross the street.

78
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:11,117
I forgot my card.
Santos, Santos Vella.

79
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,828
- It's pronounced with one "I".
- VeI-la.

80
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,114
No, Vella, like mozzarella.

81
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,232
- Vella.
- Vella.

82
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,070
Doctor!

83
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,476
Doctor!
Where are you staying?

84
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,474
Don't tell me.
At the NationaI.

85
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,629
- You're here for the convention.
- Of course.

86
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,956
- I'll drive you.
- No, I'll take a cab.

87
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,149
No problem.

88
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,829
I have to go somewhere else first.

89
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,794
I'll drive you.
It's nice to see you, doctor.

90
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,837
- My stomach...
- Fuck, no!

91
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,036
I'd rather go alone.

92
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:53,590
Great.

93
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,195
Great.

94
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:58,551
When I get to a new city,
I like to discover it alone too.

95
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,398
We're grown-ups.

96
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:03,319
Anything you need,
you've got my card.

97
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,909
You got a problem,
you call me. Okay?

98
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,954
Sure.

99
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,075
You swear?

100
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,516
No, I believe you.

101
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,596
It's a pleasure to see you,
doctor.

102
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,789
And thanks for everything.

103
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:23,838
He's a great guy, lady.
No sweat!

104
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,829
Fuck!

105
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,989
- To the NationaI HoteI, please.
- Right away.

106
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,511
Doesn't that sound strange?

107
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,115
What?

108
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,429
The car.

109
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,393
Not at all.

110
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,911
It's as strong as a bull.

111
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,594
Over 20 years without
a breakdown.

112
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,153
Son of a bitch!

113
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,758
Damn son of a bitch!

114
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,551
Got a problem?

115
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,550
A bull?
It's more like a cow!

116
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,754
What's it about?

117
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,952
The convention.

118
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,274
- TerminaI medicine.
- TerminaI medicine?

119
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,112
That's going to be fun.

120
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,509
I'm gonna fuck your father,
and I'm late!

121
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,519
Well, what then?

122
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,714
You have to go somewhere first?

123
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:11,354
- I'll go later.
- You sure?

124
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,914
Yes.

125
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,917
It was a lie, right?

126
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,073
You say that to get rid of me.
Admit it.

127
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,912
Admit it.

128
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,872
- All right, I admit it.
- Great.

129
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,676
Great.

130
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:35,592
I catch on to everything.
I've gotten smart.

131
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,154
Really, I've studied.

132
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,158
I pay attention to the things I should.

133
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,708
You see...

134
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,156
If someone tells you
you're going to die...

135
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,429
you change.

136
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:54,713
You think: What do I do
with the little time I got left?

137
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,990
You do 4 important things.

138
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:00,391
This, this and this.
The rest is just shit, man.

139
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,669
It's not worth it.

140
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,877
- That's why I owe you.
- Forget it.

141
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:06,275
No, no, no. I owe you one.

142
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:08,275
So...

143
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,119
tell me what you want.

144
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,113
I'll take care of it.

145
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,993
- Don't bother.
- It's no bother.

146
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,633
It's no bother.

147
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,389
Doctor...

148
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,958
I want to make you happy.

149
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:28,673
- What have you got there?
- I don't know. It's not mine.

150
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,270
Did you steaI it?

151
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,633
Me? Please.

152
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,718
Someone left it on the train...

153
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,353
- You haven't opened it?
- No.

154
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,630
Fuck! That is admirable.

155
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,077
Fausto, Fausto...

156
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,112
Well, here we are.

157
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,909
I'll take that case to the station.

158
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,270
No, thanks,
someone at the hoteI can...

159
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,749
I'll take care of it.
No problem.

160
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,070
Besides,
someone there owes me a favor.

161
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,713
Fausto, how nice to see you.
How are you?

162
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,792
We were betting
on whether you'd come or not.

163
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,397
- Has Quiroga arrived?
- He should have this morning.

164
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:23,199
Hi, good evening.
Santos Vella. It's a pleasure.

165
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:24,670
My pleasure.

166
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,477
Vella, pronounced with one "I".
Like mozzarella.

167
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,429
You know the doctor?

168
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,035
Of course.

169
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,231
Me too.
He removed my stomach.

170
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,236
That was a long time ago.
Forget it, man.

171
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,511
You're here for the convention?

172
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,709
Yes.

173
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,275
To talk about your
little tumors and things.

174
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,789
Thank you very much.

175
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,149
He's getting rid of me.

176
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:49,836
It's a pleasure.

177
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:52,669
Anything you need, call.

178
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,512
You want a girI?

179
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:03,157
- I don't understand.
- Man, what a joker!

180
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,712
I don't know him.
He's a patient.

181
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:22,509
My brother-in-law
went to a specialist and asked:

182
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,997
"Doctor, how long have
I get left to live?"

183
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:29,192
And you know what
the guy told him?

184
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,232
"That depends.
When will you pay my bill?"

185
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,391
Why must we wash?

186
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,234
Do butchers wash?

187
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:46,798
Who says they haven't jerked off
before cutting up a sirloin steak?

188
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,358
Although they're butchers...

189
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,595
they jerk off, don't they?

190
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,758
What do you say, Fausto?

191
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,751
"Sagittarius, Capricorn?"

192
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,239
"No, son, what I said was Cancer. "

193
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,073
Cancer, cancer. "

194
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,917
You don't need to be a butcher
to know if they jerk off.

195
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,912
She's Daisy, my assistant.

196
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,113
I've heard that before.

197
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,871
Me too, and I saw it.

198
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,038
The Frenchman, for example,
at the ProvinciaI.

199
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,514
Before each operation.

200
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,995
- Really?
- I swear.

201
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:28,319
And if he operated 3 times,
3 times.

202
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,396
They call the doctor
"the gardener".

203
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,238
- You know why?
- No.

204
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,596
Because he works with plants.

205
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,598
TerminaI cases.

206
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,957
When we don't know
what to do with someone...

207
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,629
we send them to him
to see what he invents.

208
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,956
You've all ordered mushrooms.

209
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,593
You don't understand him.

210
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:55,875
What he'd like is to see
all his patients alive.

211
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,068
Who wouldn't?

212
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,313
We should close the greenhouse.

213
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,399
It's useless.

214
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:07,351
I don't even know if it's
legaI to have all those...

215
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,074
people there.

216
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,713
It's a research center.

217
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,433
We research medicine
to be used in the first phases.

218
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,231
That's fine.

219
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,116
But I wouldn't like
to be in your shoes.

220
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,312
How many patients die a year?

221
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,919
How many this year?

222
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,469
500?

223
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,115
600?

224
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,429
When you get to a thousand,
you'll win a prize!

225
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,235
Never trust a dermatologist.

226
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,079
They skin people alive.

227
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,635
There'll be broads too.

228
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,068
Shit, Bielsa.

229
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,874
They're in coma.

230
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,957
And, so what?

231
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:55,199
You should see them at the morgue,
with the female corpses.

232
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:56,989
That's different.

233
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,715
They're dead.

234
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,874
Like Daisy.

235
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,633
20 years in practice
and still thinks...

236
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:10,912
a practitioner
is a churchgoer.

237
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,754
Excuse me.

238
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,917
Is there a doctor in the house?

239
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,079
Please!

240
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,317
Continue administering Codeine...

241
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,193
only untiI Thursday...

242
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,791
and then give him antibiotics.

243
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,952
His temperature's down to 37.8.

244
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,958
Continue with Naproxen.

245
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:06,875
RenoI.

246
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:08,950
Very good.

247
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,232
I have the file in front of me.

248
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,914
RenoI.

249
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:21,318
Let's withdraw his breather.

250
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,755
- Withdraw it?
- Completely.

251
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:26,232
The corticoids as well.
And watch his apnea.

252
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,714
Watch his evolution.

253
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:32,513
- Is his mother still with him?
- She hasn't moved.

254
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:34,990
Who is it?

255
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:35,997
Doctor?

256
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,953
- Who is it?
- Doctor?

257
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,228
Dr., are you still there?

258
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,876
Julia, my dinner's here.

259
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,674
I'll call you tomorrow.

260
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,429
Is this for reaI?

261
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,068
Great.

262
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:19,231
I love luxury hotels.

263
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,070
When I get rich,
I'II live in one like this.

264
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,039
Who are you?

265
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,631
I hear you're eminent.

266
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,193
I asked you something.

267
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,319
I study medicine.

268
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,790
This helps me pay
my registration fees.

269
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,951
I told Santos
I didn't want anything.

270
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,752
I have no idea.

271
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:55,516
What do you have to do
to be eminent?

272
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,036
Study a lot...

273
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,477
or drink a lot of milk?

274
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,118
I told Santos...

275
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,953
Hold this.

276
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:03,676
Who is it?

277
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:06,235
Room service.
Your breakfast.

278
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,396
Come in and leave it
next to the bed.

279
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:10,950
Okay.

280
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,039
Which one of the two?

281
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,837
The one that was slept in.

282
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:27,073
Do you want orange
or strawberry marmalade?

283
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:32,154
- Strawberry.
- Great, me too.

284
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,115
Good book.

285
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,635
A little slow though.
But that's okay.

286
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:40,198
They never make fuckin' toast properly.

287
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,196
What a pain!

288
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,553
What are you doing here?

289
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,711
- How'd you get in?
- That's easy.

290
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,673
A friend in maintenance
owed me a little favor.

291
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:54,149
And talking about favors,
now you owe me one.

292
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:57,478
The suitcase.
The old lady went to pick it up.

293
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,435
We'll never know what was in it.

294
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:05,435
- How'd you sleep?
- Fine.

295
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,598
- Please leave.
- Sure.

296
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:11,315
I told reception no calls.
You need to rest up a bit.

297
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:15,354
Well, what can I do for you?

298
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,831
Get out.
You have to go.

299
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:20,600
Sure, and so do you.
It's almost eleven...

300
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,995
and from here to the
University we've got...

301
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,508
You're the one who's leaving.

302
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,314
Just a moment.

303
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,755
It's for you.

304
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,673
- For me?
- Yes, for you.

305
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,275
I said I'd be here.
Excuse me. Yes?

306
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:50,111
Hey, man, what's up?

307
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,994
I'm with a friend.
What is it?

308
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:54,990
Yeah.

309
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,552
Okay, five minutes.

310
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,879
I can't go with you.

311
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:05,112
I'm so sorry.
Did I give you my card?

312
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:05,951
Yesterday.

313
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:09,079
Well, here,
I get a good price on them.

314
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:12,352
If you need any,
or anything else, just call.

315
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,591
At any time.
Will you?

316
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,355
Don't worry.

317
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:30,351
Yes?

318
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,039
- Julia.
- Doctor.

319
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,795
I called this morning
but couldn't get through.

320
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,269
They made a mistake.
Listen.

321
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,595
Do me a favor.

322
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,473
Find a Santos Vella's
medical record.

323
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,594
- With a double "I".
- Like in mozzarella.

324
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:47,355
Send it to me at the University.

325
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,751
Right away.
For your lecture?

326
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,029
Of course.

327
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:59,590
Find the origin of the illness
in the body. Surround it...

328
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:03,352
in an attempt to establish
the progress of the metastasis.

329
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,359
Determining what organs

330
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,959
were infected first.

331
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,913
Who infected who?

332
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,272
Differentiating the focaI point
from the satellites.

333
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:18,110
A sick body is like a freeway,
full of signs.

334
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,348
Of indicators.

335
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,156
Some are clear, luminous.

336
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,913
Others are concealed.

337
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,953
Illness is a clumsy criminaI.

338
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:33,556
It leaves clues.

339
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:38,154
Many times, the body itself
is the origin of the illness.

340
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:43,156
It creates it and
encourages it along the way.

341
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:45,589
From where?

342
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,432
Is there an evil gland?

343
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,956
Ancient people spent their lives
searching for it.

344
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:55,909
They thought that removing it,
they would eradicate the illness.

345
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,231
Today,
in certain Asian countries...

346
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:03,270
live rats are inserted
in the sick patients' bodies...

347
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:07,874
to track down putrefaction
amongst the healthy organs.

348
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:11,832
We now know that gland
is not in the human body.

349
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,234
It's in the soul.

350
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,159
In those occasions, the illness...

351
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,631
is a self-destructive process.

352
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,950
Trying to check it is like...

353
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:26,594
trying to stop a suicidaI person.

354
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:27,989
Death...

355
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,036
always finds its way.

356
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,918
It is an end that...

357
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,038
cannot be refused.

358
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,956
It's there from the very beginning.

359
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:42,840
It's part of the deaI
ever since we're born.

360
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,708
All births...

361
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,438
carry an implicit death.

362
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:00,591
It is not enough to teach students...

363
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:03,232
how to eradicate the illness.

364
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,352
We must also learn...

365
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,479
to accept it.

366
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:23,995
Doctor!

367
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,074
Do me the honor.

368
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,439
You know each other, right?

369
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:48,995
Listen to me.

370
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,033
I don't know how you do this...

371
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,238
nor why, but I don't care!

372
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,158
I don't want to see you again!

373
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:59,550
I want you to go,
to disappear from my life!

374
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,716
Watch what you're asking for.

375
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,638
It could come true.

376
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:08,477
Sir.

377
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,354
I thought you could use it.

378
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:13,758
Why are you so surprised?

379
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,916
I told you yesterday, in the car.

380
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:18,397
I'm here to make you happy.

381
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:21,398
I don't want your help...

382
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:24,120
and I'm not interested
in your ghost stories.

383
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:27,273
You're not the first terminaI
case to get better.

384
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:30,870
You say you're my patient,
but I'm not sure.

385
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:34,190
I think you're a charlatan...

386
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,996
and you bore me to no end!

387
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:40,112
- I don't believe a word you say.
- Ask.

388
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:40,991
What?

389
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:43,117
Make a wish.
Whatever you want.

390
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:49,994
I wish...

391
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:52,989
to go.

392
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:54,629
Granted.

393
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,756
If someone...

394
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,996
If you could make a wish...

395
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:14,750
- what would you wish?
- Everything.

396
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,833
More money, to fuck more,...

397
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:19,994
an orgy with five broads...

398
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,599
and one of them black.

399
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,629
And you?

400
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:11,389
At 13:46 we register
the first cortical activity.

401
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:14,155
Sweating, motivity and spasms.

402
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:17,075
Voluntary medullary movements...

403
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:20,113
and cornea, labial
and trachea reflexes...

404
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,231
that continue until 13:52.

405
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:26,237
Oculocephalic reactions after...

406
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:30,069
lateralization and heave
movements of the head.

407
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:33,438
Blood pressure stabilized,
and behavioral response...

408
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:35,471
to nociceptive stimuli.

409
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:39,708
At 13:59, the oxygen mask and
endotrachea catheter were removed

410
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,791
without symptoms of apnea.

411
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:45,520
Three minutes later,
he hugs his mother.

412
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:48,837
17 minutes in total.
Isn't that incredible?

413
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,079
Incredible, yes.

414
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,959
I called the University,
but you had already left.

415
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,075
- Aren't you pleased?
- Of course.

416
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,955
I'll give you the report tomorrow.

417
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,793
I'll take the first train.

418
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:08,356
Doctor.

419
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,553
It's the most amazing recovery
I've ever seen.

420
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,668
Congratulations.

421
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:43,118
What are you looking for?

422
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:47,677
Fausto, have you lost
your speech?

423
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:52,954
What are you doing?

424
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:54,709
Please, sir!

425
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,792
God, I just picked it up!

426
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,913
...dying has become so indecent
that it is disguised and sterilized...

427
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:04,032
between clean
and opaque hospital walls.

428
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,992
Death exists.

429
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:09,238
It forms part of life.
It may be the non-life.

430
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,111
Santos Vella.

431
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,356
Although it's been repressed,
exiled...

432
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:15,833
from the sociaI awareness
it had belonged to...

433
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:19,274
the greatest deceit
for the dying...

434
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:20,515
Have we met before?

435
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:21,830
I don't think so.

436
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:25,596
It is not charity
for those who are to die...

437
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,756
Are you sure?
I think we have.

438
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,998
At a hospitaI, maybe?

439
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:33,999
I doubt it.
I visit my patients at home.

440
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,478
Then at some brotheI.

441
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,600
...a causaI illness
of progressive evolution...

442
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:46,633
with a prognosis
of one month to live,...

443
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:49,559
a treatment of proved
inefficiency...

444
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:53,036
and a loss of hope for recovery.

445
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:59,432
The clinicaI reports...

446
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:04,155
indicate the degree of damage...

447
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:08,230
or organic insufficiency,
and allow establishing deadlines.

448
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:10,879
TerminaI processes.

449
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,748
Excuse me.
What did you say your name is?

450
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:16,315
I didn't say.
Doctor Fierro.

451
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:21,029
Which implies
an old acquaintance...

452
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,799
who I'd rather not see...

453
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,711
- Doctor Fierro.
- Yes.

454
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:30,838
- Cardiologist?
- No, dermatologist.

455
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:32,116
What a coincidence!

456
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:33,591
You too?

457
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:36,872
No. I've got some spots.

458
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,359
What do you think?

459
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,439
It's the first time.

460
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,395
...of a pilgrimage that begins...

461
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,909
with the birth of said protocoI.

462
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:57,795
These images belong to research...

463
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,720
work and surgicaI revitalization
of tissues...

464
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:03,309
carried out
over a two-year period...

465
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:06,432
which we call
the blue phase of the project.

466
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:08,708
They were taken...

467
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:12,638
during the operations
carried out by...

468
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:15,149
the professionaI team
coordinated by...

469
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:34,830
I gave the tape to her.
Shit, it's not my fault!

470
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,356
Your research is very interesting.
We've learned a lot.

471
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,913
Did you film that?

472
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:43,675
It was you!

473
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:44,676
What?

474
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:46,596
Quiroga, I ought to...

475
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:53,472
You ought to what?

476
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,873
I'll tell you.
You ought to shut up.

477
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:01,431
And make sure of thing
before accusing anyone.

478
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:05,514
And show a little more
respect for your colleagues.

479
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:07,989
But, above all, you ought to...

480
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:12,354
lend us that tape for tonight.

481
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:21,596
Fierro.

482
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,752
That means "iron".

483
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,319
Dermatologist.

484
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:28,554
He prescribed a cream, DisantiI.

485
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:30,434
I don't know him.

486
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:34,955
Is she nice?

487
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:36,750
What?

488
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:39,231
Your assistant, Julia.

489
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,673
What do you know about Julia?

490
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:46,474
You never tell me anything.

491
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:49,956
You want to know things about me,
but never tell me anything.

492
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:53,758
"Dr. Fausto,
the report you asked me for.

493
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:56,795
Julia. "

494
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:02,039
If you want to know anything
about me, just ask.

495
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:13,196
Who are you?

496
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:15,790
Your best wish.

497
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:20,596
Why?

498
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,837
Because you alone aren't capable.

499
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:28,030
For how long?

500
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:29,758
UntiI they come true.

501
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:31,549
All of them.

502
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,995
You're getting old, Fausto.

503
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:49,437
How old do you think I am?

504
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:53,156
The same as you.
Do I look it?

505
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:55,951
I take care of myself.

506
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:59,832
But you don't
take care of yourself.

507
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,188
Look how you dress.

508
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:05,836
You earn money and
can buy yourself a better suit.

509
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,599
We're fucked.

510
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:22,153
I've got something you could use.

511
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:24,954
There was a Chinese proverb.

512
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:26,915
How'd it go?

513
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:30,396
I forgot.

514
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:31,949
Oh, yes!

515
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:36,308
Dress you body with elegant clothes
and your souI will smile.

516
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:39,589
What the fuck do they know,
they wear robes?

517
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:41,193
My house.
You like it?

518
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,916
How many hours a day
do you work?

519
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:48,075
You're so surrounded by corpses...

520
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:51,035
that you look like them
more and more.

521
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:52,315
Come in.

522
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:59,516
Make yourself at home.

523
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:03,071
Doctor, right this way.

524
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:08,948
Have you ever tried...

525
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:11,396
leaving a restaurant
without paying?

526
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:13,870
Or crossing the street
against the light?

527
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:15,555
No, right?

528
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:18,518
Have you tried living?

529
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:22,195
- Certain things can't change.
- That's not you talking.

530
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:25,913
- It wasn't you who said that.
- No?

531
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:31,509
- Who did then?
- Your dissatisfaction.

532
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:34,995
And dissatisfaction is an illness.

533
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:38,076
Of the souI, but an illness.

534
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:46,273
Is she nice or not?

535
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:47,351
What?

536
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:49,994
Your assistant.
What's her name...? Julia.

537
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:52,631
Don't tell me it never
crossed your mind.

538
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:54,717
- How do I know?
- "How do I know?"

539
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:56,592
Have you taken
a good look at her?

540
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:58,509
Did you ever kiss her?

541
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:02,799
Yes, once.
On her birthday.

542
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:08,237
Blessed Christ
of the Holy Power, doctor.

543
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:18,519
You two have
an unhealthy relationship.

544
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:20,394
Your glass.

545
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:26,672
That wouldn't be bad.

546
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:29,157
What?

547
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:31,237
Someone to look after her and...

548
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:33,396
Not "someone".
Who is "someone"?

549
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:35,551
Believe me, let yourself go.

550
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:39,034
For example:

551
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:43,356
Haven't you ever wanted to break
something really expensive?

552
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:45,438
No, don't do it.

553
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:48,717
Have you wanted to or not?

554
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:50,874
Sometimes.

555
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:55,239
Let's see.

556
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:57,033
Number seven.

557
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:00,992
Well, well.

558
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:03,838
That's why you're alive.

559
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:07,758
Because you wished it.

560
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:09,869
Could be.

561
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:13,836
Come on, it's very relaxing.

562
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:19,949
Every wanted to rob a store?

563
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:21,878
Go to the movies
without paying?

564
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:24,958
Or drink
your neighbor's whiskey...

565
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:28,550
and put your feet on the table
like a gentleman?

566
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:29,910
Doctor!

567
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:32,232
Have music blasting?

568
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:34,870
Fuck the neighbors!

569
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:37,393
To yell and dance...

570
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:42,428
and jump on the sofa...

571
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:45,433
and just go crazy?

572
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:47,551
Come on!

573
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:56,953
- Ever wanted to kill someone?
- What?

574
00:46:58,320 --> 00:46:59,275
Kill.

575
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:08,675
Doctor!

576
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:10,912
- Try it on.
- For me?

577
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:31,276
Okay?

578
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:32,470
What?

579
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:34,068
How is it?

580
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:38,588
- Why are you taking so long?
- Just a moment!

581
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,433
I'm almost done.

582
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:28,039
To me that's not funny.

583
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:32,438
I think it's very funny.

584
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:37,832
I had to write them a check.

585
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:42,389
A check?

586
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:44,115
How much?

587
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:46,074
Six hundred.

588
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:52,194
I'm sorry.
Six hundred thousand?

589
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:58,679
You at least kept the suit.

590
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:01,114
It doesn't matter.

591
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:04,633
It's going to bounce.

592
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:09,113
Fuckin' cooI!

593
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:12,398
There's no money!

594
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:15,748
Look at you!

595
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:23,917
- What day is today?
- How do I know?

596
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:26,509
My daughter's throwing a party.
Let's go.

597
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:29,190
No, I should go to the hoteI.

598
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:33,034
Doctor, your wishes.
Don't you remember?

599
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:36,029
Besides,
she has some nice girlfriends.

600
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:40,518
Really, he has a
young friend, doctor...

601
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:42,836
- Don't tempt me.
- Don't tempt me!

602
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:45,676
Sure I tempt you.
That's what we're here for.

603
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:41,038
I love young people.

604
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:13,748
Doctor Fausto!

605
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:15,914
Thank you so much!

606
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:19,195
My case.

607
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:21,709
I don't know what I'd
have done without it.

608
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:23,476
You want her?

609
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:33,318
I can get her for you.

610
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:36,709
Where's your daughter?

611
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:39,196
I don't know.
Around somewhere.

612
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:41,034
What's the matter?

613
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:46,433
Julia must be worried
something happened to me.

614
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:48,949
She's worried
you're fucking someone else.

615
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:51,156
Santos, look at this!

616
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:53,713
They're Rolex.

617
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:05,675
Doctor!

618
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:07,673
I'm so happy to see you!

619
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:11,074
Do I know you?

620
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:13,196
A blow job in your hoteI.
Remember?

621
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:19,315
- That's right.
- What are you doing here?

622
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:21,912
Roaming around.

623
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:23,674
You look better.

624
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:26,474
- Than when I blew you off.
- Thanks.

625
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:28,355
Thanks a lot.

626
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:30,153
Martita!

627
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:31,829
Daddy!

628
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:33,149
Hello, darling!

629
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:36,317
- Where were you?
- Right here.

630
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:38,553
A little present!

631
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:40,829
Look.

632
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:44,470
My daughter.

633
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:46,753
You had met, right?

634
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:07,277
Can I make a wish
for someone else?

635
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:09,471
- For who?
- For Julia.

636
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:11,390
Go ahead.

637
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:13,478
I told you before.

638
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:16,793
I'd like for someone
to take care of her.

639
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:19,948
Don't worry.

640
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:22,757
What do you mean "don't worry"?

641
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:24,999
What is "don't worry"?

642
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:29,479
Someone'll take care of her.

643
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:30,994
"Granted".

644
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:33,119
ReaI genies...

645
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:35,391
say "granted".

646
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:37,349
Not "don't worry".

647
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:42,629
- Granted.
- That's better.

648
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:44,669
"Don't worry".

649
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:47,469
What a shitty genie you are.

650
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:50,799
Where are you going?

651
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:53,475
Take a fuckin' guess.

652
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:55,717
Aren't you a genie?

653
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:59,428
Genies never guess.
Those are magicians.

654
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:02,438
He's an asshole.

655
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:04,951
Manolo, another drink.

656
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:13,636
Hello.

657
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:15,110
Hello.

658
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:19,071
Your hands are blue.

659
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:20,635
I know.

660
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:23,115
Yeah?
And you don't care?

661
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:29,318
- It doesn't wash away.
- That's how they are.

662
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:30,709
I dye things blue.

663
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:33,117
Things?
What things?

664
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:35,316
I don't know, everything.

665
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:40,035
You live here?

666
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:43,951
- In the bathroom?
- No, I mean in the city.

667
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:46,916
For now.
I love to move around.

668
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:49,510
- Don't you?
- Moving? I love it.

669
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:52,718
Today here, tomorrow there.
Adventures.

670
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:55,078
- What do you do?
- Nothing.

671
00:57:56,360 --> 00:57:59,397
I operate tumors, necrosis,
those little things.

672
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:02,148
Really?
Or are you putting me on?

673
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:06,109
"Putting me on"?
What does that mean?

674
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:10,632
It's something like teasing me,
making fun of me.

675
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:12,909
"Putting me on".

676
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:14,439
I like that.

677
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:20,757
- What's your name?
- Margarita.

678
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:22,156
For now.

679
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:25,397
For now?
You like to change names?

680
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:27,477
Of course. Don't you?

681
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:31,912
You're "putting me on".

682
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:33,596
No I'm not.

683
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:36,593
Yes, I can tell
you are "putting me on".

684
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:39,392
You're "putting me on".

685
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:43,550
- She's "putting me on".
- Let's go!

686
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:51,477
At your service, Fausto.

687
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:54,599
Why did he say that?

688
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:56,635
No reason.

689
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:00,278
It's a very long story.

690
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:05,591
He spends his time
granting me my wishes.

691
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:06,357
All of them?

692
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:10,708
What do you mean?

693
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:15,754
All your wishes?

694
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:18,759
The eviI ones too?

695
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:24,188
I'm sure you have eviI wishes too.

696
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:25,550
Maybe.

697
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:15,149
Doctor...

698
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:17,308
is this going to hurt?

699
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:06,156
Fausto.

700
01:03:06,320 --> 01:03:07,469
Fausto, wake up.

701
01:03:08,320 --> 01:03:09,673
You're going to miss this.

702
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:10,915
Look.

703
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:22,392
It's not very straight.

704
01:03:22,600 --> 01:03:24,238
But it's not bad,
for being my first time.

705
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:26,158
Santos, get it off me!

706
01:03:27,040 --> 01:03:28,359
Get it off me!

707
01:03:29,960 --> 01:03:31,154
Get out of there.

708
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:34,276
He hadn't eaten anything,
you know?

709
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:38,599
Let's see what we've got here.

710
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:42,197
What was that you said?

711
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:43,913
Please, Santos!

712
01:03:44,920 --> 01:03:47,195
Is there an eviI gland?

713
01:03:48,280 --> 01:03:49,395
It exists, Fausto.

714
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:51,837
Do you have it?
Well, I do.

715
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:55,392
It's an enormous gland.

716
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:57,558
As large as me.

717
01:03:59,640 --> 01:04:01,835
Not you.
You're good. Yes.

718
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:06,153
You just have
a very little gland...

719
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:09,155
that is annoying
and makes you doubt,...

720
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:11,078
makes you be a little eviI...

721
01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:13,238
but only at times.

722
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:16,829
Well, let's rip it out
before it grows.

723
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:21,719
Let's see.

724
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:25,829
Here it is!

725
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:29,995
Could this be it?

726
01:04:31,360 --> 01:04:32,588
I don't think so.

727
01:04:32,760 --> 01:04:35,593
Fuck, could I be looking
in the wrong place?

728
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:37,153
Maybe it's down here.

729
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:35,999
An atrocity. They've given
him a terrible beating.

730
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:39,237
OccipitaI trauma with loss,
possible clot, evaluate.

731
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:41,556
Respiratory apnea
with loss of tone.

732
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:44,320
OccipitaI trauma with loss,
left vestibular tearing.

733
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:45,914
Stop, stop!

734
01:06:46,520 --> 01:06:48,556
- Isn't that Quiroga?
- I think so.

735
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:50,352
Give me the Mayo tube,
fast.

736
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:52,510
That's it.

737
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:54,879
Come on, come on, fast.

738
01:07:22,840 --> 01:07:23,909
Doctor Fausto!

739
01:07:25,560 --> 01:07:27,039
Doctor Fausto, please!

740
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:28,356
Doctor!

741
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:32,429
Doctor Fausto!

742
01:08:35,160 --> 01:08:37,469
QUIROGA, SON OF A BITCH!

743
01:09:09,880 --> 01:09:12,269
For God's sake,
what have you done?

744
01:09:12,480 --> 01:09:15,472
No, man, no. Please.
I didn't do anything.

745
01:09:15,680 --> 01:09:16,590
I just got here.

746
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:19,879
He did it.

747
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:21,229
I'm sure it was him.

748
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:23,953
He gets in anywhere.

749
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:27,030
Friends owe him favors,
and here too.

750
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:30,078
Who?
I don't know who you mean.

751
01:09:30,280 --> 01:09:32,032
The room is in your name.

752
01:09:32,240 --> 01:09:35,789
Everything is broken.
There were many things.

753
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:38,236
Expensive things, broken.

754
01:09:38,440 --> 01:09:39,589
You must pay.

755
01:09:41,280 --> 01:09:42,508
Why all this?

756
01:09:42,920 --> 01:09:45,992
Because I removed his stomach,
his fuckin' stomach!

757
01:09:52,160 --> 01:09:52,558
Yes.

758
01:09:52,760 --> 01:09:53,670
Doctor?

759
01:09:54,240 --> 01:09:56,629
I'm at the station.
I just got in.

760
01:09:57,240 --> 01:09:58,593
I've brought it all.

761
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:00,677
The doctor said
I'd see you at lunch.

762
01:10:02,280 --> 01:10:04,191
Doctor?
What doctor?

763
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:06,956
Fierro. He's very kind.

764
01:10:07,160 --> 01:10:08,798
You shouldn't have bothered.

765
01:10:09,200 --> 01:10:11,714
Fierro. I didn't... Julia!

766
01:10:12,240 --> 01:10:13,673
Fausto, did you sleep well?

767
01:10:13,880 --> 01:10:15,154
Very little, of course.

768
01:10:15,880 --> 01:10:18,030
Let me talk to Julia!

769
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:19,719
She had a good trip.

770
01:10:20,440 --> 01:10:21,111
Excuse me.

771
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:27,037
- I was right, she's a piece.
- Leave her alone!

772
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:29,438
Stay away from her!

773
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:31,034
Don't touch her!
Julia!

774
01:10:31,240 --> 01:10:34,789
Don't be so possessive,
you never looked twice at her.

775
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:36,513
Son of a bitch, don't touch her!

776
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:39,555
If you touch her, I'll kill you!

777
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:41,319
Why worry?

778
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:45,190
You wished this, remember?
"Someone to take care of her. "

779
01:10:46,520 --> 01:10:47,953
No, don't thank me.

780
01:10:48,160 --> 01:10:49,149
That's what I'm here for.

781
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:50,918
I owe it to you.

782
01:10:51,720 --> 01:10:52,914
I will.

783
01:10:54,440 --> 01:10:55,555
Regards.

784
01:10:56,640 --> 01:10:58,949
That man worries a lot about you.

785
01:10:59,160 --> 01:11:01,390
- He sounded a bit strange.
- His voice.

786
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:03,272
Yesterday
we went dancing untiI late.

787
01:11:03,880 --> 01:11:04,790
Really?

788
01:11:06,920 --> 01:11:08,672
What are you doing,
have you gone crazy?

789
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:12,428
You can't go.

790
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:16,555
- You ruined the room...
- The fuckin' room seems yours!

791
01:11:17,320 --> 01:11:18,719
Listen, wait!

792
01:11:25,960 --> 01:11:28,428
Hey, calm down.
It's loaded.

793
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:31,151
- Easy.
- Don't move!

794
01:11:31,880 --> 01:11:32,790
Freeze!

795
01:11:33,440 --> 01:11:35,795
Fuckin' freeze!
Don't follow me!

796
01:11:36,360 --> 01:11:38,316
- Don't follow me!
- Take it easy.

797
01:11:39,080 --> 01:11:41,992
Attention, security, armed
man. Second floor.

798
01:11:45,440 --> 01:11:46,270
Move it!

799
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:53,510
Move it!

800
01:11:55,640 --> 01:11:59,189
He's armed. He's leaving the
hoteI. Call the police.

801
01:12:11,720 --> 01:12:12,869
I hope they show up.

802
01:12:13,880 --> 01:12:15,029
I hope they show up.

803
01:12:19,120 --> 01:12:20,792
I hope they fuckin' show up!

804
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:28,154
I hope they show up.

805
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:35,589
Where is he?

806
01:12:36,320 --> 01:12:38,436
Where is Santos,
you son of a bitch?

807
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:41,711
Talk!

808
01:12:42,240 --> 01:12:43,798
Talk or I'll kill you!

809
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:44,512
Talk!

810
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:46,989
It's okay, he's a patient of mine.

811
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:53,594
Where is Santos?

812
01:12:54,280 --> 01:12:55,599
Where is he?

813
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:57,274
Talk or I'll kill you!

814
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:01,994
You bastard!

815
01:13:09,880 --> 01:13:12,917
Let's have a drink
while we wait for the doctor.

816
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:16,558
I don't know if I should.
I'm a bit tired from the trip.

817
01:13:25,280 --> 01:13:27,999
I promised the doctor
I'd take care of you.

818
01:13:28,240 --> 01:13:28,990
A drink?

819
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:31,635
- Well, if you insist.
- I insist.

820
01:13:32,240 --> 01:13:34,993
You heard me.
You can check it.

821
01:13:35,200 --> 01:13:36,394
I'm a surgeon.

822
01:13:36,840 --> 01:13:38,592
I'm here for a convention.

823
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:43,353
He's crazy.

824
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:46,757
Fuck, you don't understand!

825
01:13:47,080 --> 01:13:48,035
He'll kill her!

826
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:50,678
He'll kill my assistant!

827
01:13:52,840 --> 01:13:55,638
Finish your drink.
It'll do you good.

828
01:13:58,240 --> 01:13:59,229
I'm a doctor.

829
01:14:03,400 --> 01:14:05,311
Fausto will be here any minute now.

830
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:24,950
- You're very kind.
- Thank you.

831
01:14:31,480 --> 01:14:32,708
Are you two involved?

832
01:14:33,320 --> 01:14:35,834
I'm sorry if I've said anything
I shouldn't have.

833
01:14:36,440 --> 01:14:37,236
No.

834
01:14:40,320 --> 01:14:42,356
It's not that.
Our relationship is...

835
01:14:44,160 --> 01:14:45,354
professionaI.

836
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:52,878
Ten years working together,
and with a woman...

837
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:55,955
like you,
next to him every day...

838
01:14:57,200 --> 01:14:58,474
there's been...

839
01:14:59,240 --> 01:15:00,116
nothing?

840
01:15:01,960 --> 01:15:03,313
Nothing at all?

841
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:14,550
You're a very speciaI woman, Julia.

842
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,468
- Charge it to 213.
- Okay.

843
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:52,191
Yeah.

844
01:15:57,880 --> 01:16:00,269
Where'd you say
you visit your patients?

845
01:16:00,480 --> 01:16:01,515
I didn't say.

846
01:16:03,680 --> 01:16:06,797
In private clinics.
I can't stand large hospitals.

847
01:16:07,720 --> 01:16:10,154
All that bureaucracy
was making me dizzy.

848
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:19,788
I think Dr. Fausto
is going to be late.

849
01:16:20,200 --> 01:16:20,996
Yes.

850
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:26,992
- Anything planned for tonight?
- No, nothing.

851
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:29,953
I can't believe that.

852
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:42,793
- How long has it been?
- Ages.

853
01:16:43,880 --> 01:16:47,429
The uniform looks good.
You're quite a dandy, Alfonsito.

854
01:16:48,320 --> 01:16:51,118
Your wife takes good care of
you. You don't deserve her.

855
01:16:51,320 --> 01:16:52,958
That's the way it goes.

856
01:16:53,680 --> 01:16:55,159
How are the kids?

857
01:16:55,480 --> 01:16:57,038
The elder is eight now.

858
01:16:57,920 --> 01:17:00,832
Eight years?
Time sure does fuckin' fly.

859
01:17:01,680 --> 01:17:04,319
- She was in the cradle.
- This is the baby.

860
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:06,476
Shit!

861
01:17:06,680 --> 01:17:10,309
- She starts schooI next week.
- You are drooling, my man!

862
01:17:12,520 --> 01:17:14,112
The hoteI has dropped the charges.

863
01:17:15,960 --> 01:17:18,474
Fausto, for God's sake,
what is this?

864
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:21,399
Have you seen yourself?

865
01:17:22,480 --> 01:17:23,959
Have you calmed down?

866
01:17:24,440 --> 01:17:26,670
Promise him you won't do it again.

867
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:27,517
Listen!

868
01:17:29,960 --> 01:17:33,635
I operated him many years ago.

869
01:17:34,960 --> 01:17:36,951
He should be dead,
but he isn't.

870
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:39,910
I removed his entire stomach.

871
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:43,998
Now he say
he want to make me happy.

872
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:49,035
That fucked him so much,
now he's after me.

873
01:17:51,160 --> 01:17:53,993
What about my assistant?
Maybe he killed her.

874
01:17:55,080 --> 01:17:57,310
- Please, arrest him!
- Here we go again.

875
01:17:57,520 --> 01:18:00,512
Fausto, don't be silly
or this gentleman won't let you out.

876
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:01,516
Come on.

877
01:18:08,760 --> 01:18:10,637
Were you really carrying a gun?

878
01:18:12,560 --> 01:18:13,834
You had me fooled.

879
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:25,271
Julia's an extraordinary woman.

880
01:18:26,080 --> 01:18:27,638
And very attractive.

881
01:18:29,920 --> 01:18:32,309
You should learn
to look at her differently.

882
01:18:33,160 --> 01:18:34,752
I'm sure she'd love that.

883
01:18:36,400 --> 01:18:39,119
She has told me a few things...

884
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,309
about you.
She likes you a lot, you know?

885
01:18:53,560 --> 01:18:54,675
What did you do to her?

886
01:18:55,920 --> 01:18:57,239
What you wanted.

887
01:18:59,720 --> 01:19:00,994
Take care of her.

888
01:19:05,760 --> 01:19:08,513
Shit, stop that,
you're gonna make me fuckin' cry!

889
01:19:11,680 --> 01:19:12,795
Please.

890
01:19:16,920 --> 01:19:18,478
Is there any way...

891
01:19:20,080 --> 01:19:21,308
to stop all this?

892
01:19:22,400 --> 01:19:23,071
Yes.

893
01:19:23,560 --> 01:19:24,515
Of course.

894
01:19:26,680 --> 01:19:27,749
One.

895
01:20:13,080 --> 01:20:14,513
I'm going to miss you.

896
01:20:20,240 --> 01:20:22,993
Okay, okay,
there's no need to say it, doctor.

897
01:20:26,360 --> 01:20:27,952
I know what you're thinking.

898
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:32,228
The bill for 209, please.
I'm checking out.

899
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:33,596
All right.

900
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:37,553
- Dr. Fausto, right?
- Yes.

901
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:39,751
Someone is waiting in the bar, sir.

902
01:21:41,280 --> 01:21:41,917
Who?

903
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:45,478
She didn't leave a name.

904
01:22:08,320 --> 01:22:09,389
Julia?

905
01:22:12,640 --> 01:22:13,550
Julia!

906
01:22:19,040 --> 01:22:21,190
- Are you all right?
- Just fine.

907
01:22:23,240 --> 01:22:24,229
And you?

908
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:26,199
You had me worried.

909
01:22:26,760 --> 01:22:28,512
We waited all afternoon.

910
01:22:29,880 --> 01:22:32,519
My day has been a little...

911
01:22:33,920 --> 01:22:34,670
weird.

912
01:22:35,120 --> 01:22:38,271
Dr. Fierro couldn't wait.
He told me to tell you.

913
01:22:42,480 --> 01:22:44,914
I've brought RenoI's report.
Everything.

914
01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:51,955
I got a research
committee together...

915
01:22:52,160 --> 01:22:53,752
and they want you in it.

916
01:23:01,840 --> 01:23:03,432
They want you there soon.

917
01:23:04,200 --> 01:23:05,553
Today, if possible.

918
01:23:13,080 --> 01:23:14,672
The records you wanted.

919
01:23:16,680 --> 01:23:17,795
The complete originals.

920
01:23:26,440 --> 01:23:27,156
How strange.

921
01:23:29,960 --> 01:23:30,995
It's not signed.

922
01:23:34,600 --> 01:23:36,477
I must have overlooked that.

923
01:23:50,240 --> 01:23:53,869
The next train out today is at 7:15.

924
01:23:54,320 --> 01:23:55,878
That's in 20 minutes.

925
01:24:06,200 --> 01:24:07,269
The next one's at 9...

926
01:24:12,360 --> 01:24:14,078
and the last one at 11:30.

927
01:24:16,160 --> 01:24:17,195
Julia...

928
01:24:19,440 --> 01:24:20,919
we work too much.

929
01:24:21,680 --> 01:24:23,591
We should take the day off.

930
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:26,718
A day to relax,
and go back tomorrow. Okay?

931
01:24:33,400 --> 01:24:34,833
Have you visited the city?

932
01:24:35,680 --> 01:24:37,272
- No.
- Great!

933
01:24:40,440 --> 01:24:41,589
You'II love it.

934
01:24:43,920 --> 01:24:45,638
Pour me a whiskey, and...

935
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:47,995
The same.

936
01:24:50,720 --> 01:24:52,039
Have you had fun?

937
01:24:54,480 --> 01:24:55,469
Truthfully...

938
01:24:59,000 --> 01:24:59,750
yes.

939
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:05,272
Want anything else?

940
01:25:16,160 --> 01:25:17,275
What's wrong?

941
01:25:17,760 --> 01:25:18,829
Nothing. You see...

942
01:25:21,520 --> 01:25:22,873
for a moment...

943
01:25:25,720 --> 01:25:26,948
before seeing you...

944
01:25:29,200 --> 01:25:30,428
I wanted...

945
01:25:33,720 --> 01:25:34,914
to be dead.
