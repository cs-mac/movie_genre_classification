1
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:17,076
# Do not forsake me, oh my darlin'

2
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,551
# On this, our weddin' day

3
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,595
# Do not forsake me, oh my darlin'

4
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:34,193
# Wait, wait along

5
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,714
# The noon day train will bring Frank Miller

6
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,230
# If I'm a man, I must be brave

7
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,957
# And I must face that deadly killer

8
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:59,874
# Orl ie a coward, a craven coward

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,154
# Or lie a coward in my grave

10
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:13,830
# Oh, to be torn 'tweenst love and duty
S'pposin'I lose my fair-hairbeauty

11
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:19,194
# Look at that big hand move
along Nearin' high noon

12
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:25,831
# He made a vow while in state prison
That it would be my life or his

13
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,838
# I'm not afraid of death, but oh

14
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,830
# What will I do if you leave me

15
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,757
# Do not forsake me, oh my darlin'

16
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,557
# You made that promise when we wed

17
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,909
# Do not forsake me, oh my darlin'

18
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:58,913
# Although you're grievin', I can't be leavin'

19
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:03,955
# Unti'l I shoot Frank Miller dead

20
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:10,073
# Wait along, wait along

21
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,719
Did you see what I saw?

22
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:53,414
Come on, Joe. Open her up.
We're gonna have a big day today.

23
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:54,605
Come on, get the door open.

24
00:04:01,858 --> 00:04:04,292
- You in a hurry?
- Yeah, I sure am.

25
00:04:04,609 --> 00:04:06,964
You're a fool. Come on.

26
00:04:11,817 --> 00:04:14,934
All right, all right, ladies and gentlemen,
let us begin.

27
00:04:16,192 --> 00:04:19,150
Now, will the bride and groom
kindly step forward?

28
00:04:22,234 --> 00:04:24,225
Will Kane and Amy Fowler,

29
00:04:24,443 --> 00:04:28,800
you appear before me in my capacity
as justice of the peace of this township

30
00:04:29,109 --> 00:04:32,624
to be joined together
in the bonds of holy matrimony.

31
00:04:39,567 --> 00:04:43,480
- Man, it sure is hot.
- Hot? You call this hot?

32
00:04:47,526 --> 00:04:48,720
Well, I'll be...

33
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:51,130
- What's the matter?
- Thought I saw Ben Miller.

34
00:04:51,443 --> 00:04:54,276
- He's down in Texas somewhere.
- I know.

35
00:04:54,609 --> 00:04:56,645
Looked like Pierce and Colby, too.

36
00:04:57,236 --> 00:04:58,589
It couldn't be, though.

37
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,627
My goodness gracious.

38
00:05:27,276 --> 00:05:30,313
- Noon train on time?
- Yes, sir.

39
00:05:30,653 --> 00:05:32,450
At least, I think so, sir.

40
00:05:32,652 --> 00:05:36,201
Don't know a reason
why it shouldn't be, Mr Pierce.

41
00:05:37,193 --> 00:05:41,869
How are you, Mr Miller?
Mr Pierce? Mr Colby?

42
00:06:17,445 --> 00:06:20,517
Do you, Will Kane,
take Amy to be your lawful wedded wife,

43
00:06:20,778 --> 00:06:22,814
to have and to hold
from this day forward

44
00:06:23,029 --> 00:06:24,621
until death do you part?

45
00:06:25,195 --> 00:06:26,548
I do.

46
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:29,573
Do you, Amy, take Will
to be your lawful wedded husband,

47
00:06:29,904 --> 00:06:32,464
to have and to hold
from this day forward

48
00:06:32,696 --> 00:06:34,368
until death do you part?

49
00:06:34,653 --> 00:06:35,722
I do.

50
00:06:36,321 --> 00:06:38,516
The ring, please.

51
00:06:44,696 --> 00:06:48,371
Then, by the authority vested in me
by the laws of this territory,

52
00:06:48,737 --> 00:06:51,205
I pronounce you man and wife.

53
00:06:57,570 --> 00:07:01,609
I can't speak for the rest of you men,
but I claim an ancient privilege.

54
00:07:09,405 --> 00:07:11,475
Moving mighty fast for a Sunday.

55
00:07:15,655 --> 00:07:16,610
Will!

56
00:07:18,155 --> 00:07:20,032
All those people.

57
00:07:20,987 --> 00:07:24,457
Amy, seems to me like people ought to
be alone when they get married.

58
00:07:24,821 --> 00:07:26,015
I know.

59
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:30,541
I'm going to try, Amy. I'll do my best.

60
00:07:32,029 --> 00:07:33,348
I will, too.

61
00:07:39,905 --> 00:07:42,703
The honeymoon is officially over.
Come on, everybody.

62
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:44,349
And don't look so shocked.

63
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:46,998
No way to treat a man
on his honeymoon day, is it?

64
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:50,727
Well, one more ceremony
and Will's a free man,

65
00:07:50,989 --> 00:07:52,786
more or less.

66
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:54,946
Well, Marshal, turn in your badge.

67
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,838
To tell you the truth,
I kind of hate to do this

68
00:07:57,031 --> 00:07:58,783
without your new marshal being here.

69
00:07:58,988 --> 00:08:03,220
Will, Fuller, Howe and I are the entire
Board of Selectmen of this community.

70
00:08:03,531 --> 00:08:05,647
We're also your very good friends.

71
00:08:05,864 --> 00:08:08,424
With the fine job you've done here,
I feel free to say,

72
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:10,213
and the judge will bear me out,

73
00:08:10,405 --> 00:08:12,396
this town will be safe till tomorrow.

74
00:08:14,031 --> 00:08:15,259
You win.

75
00:08:16,072 --> 00:08:18,632
But don't ever marry a Quaker.
She'll have you running a store.

76
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:21,618
- I can't picture you doing that, Will.
- I can.

77
00:08:21,989 --> 00:08:24,742
So can I. And a good thing, too.

78
00:08:25,114 --> 00:08:26,183
Thank you.

79
00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:29,906
You didn't talk that way
when you were wearing a star.

80
00:08:31,615 --> 00:08:34,891
All right, it's coming off.
But I got to be paid first.

81
00:08:37,239 --> 00:08:38,831
Let me down!

82
00:08:39,698 --> 00:08:42,656
- Not till you kiss me.
- Let me down, you fool.

83
00:08:57,032 --> 00:08:59,546
Nice delaying action, Will.
You should've been a lawyer.

84
00:08:59,782 --> 00:09:01,693
- I was cut out for bigger sport.
- Marshal.

85
00:09:01,906 --> 00:09:03,578
Marshal, telegram for you.

86
00:09:06,032 --> 00:09:08,102
It's terrible. It's shocking.

87
00:09:10,448 --> 00:09:11,881
They've pardoned Frank Miller.

88
00:09:12,073 --> 00:09:13,904
- What is it, Will?
- I don't believe it.

89
00:09:14,532 --> 00:09:17,968
A week ago, too.
Nice of them to let you know.

90
00:09:18,324 --> 00:09:19,552
And that ain't all.

91
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:22,573
Ben Miller's down at the depot now
with Jim Pierce and Jack Colby.

92
00:09:22,908 --> 00:09:25,547
- He asked about the noon train.
- The noon train?

93
00:09:29,199 --> 00:09:32,236
Will, you get out of this town.

94
00:09:33,075 --> 00:09:34,906
Get out of this town this very minute.

95
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:36,310
- Come on, let's get him going.
- What is it?

96
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:37,479
Never mind that now.

97
00:09:37,657 --> 00:09:39,966
Just get going
and don't stop till you get to Clarksburg.

98
00:09:40,199 --> 00:09:41,188
But what is it, Mr Howe?

99
00:09:41,366 --> 00:09:42,401
Don't you worry, madam.

100
00:09:42,575 --> 00:09:44,850
You'll be out of town
in a minute and everything'll be all right.

101
00:09:45,074 --> 00:09:46,427
Go on, Will,
we'll take care of everything.

102
00:09:46,616 --> 00:09:47,935
I think I ought to stay.

103
00:09:48,116 --> 00:09:49,947
Are you crazy? Think of Amy.

104
00:09:54,241 --> 00:09:55,356
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, Amy.

105
00:09:55,533 --> 00:09:58,127
Don't you worry.
Everything will be all right.

106
00:09:58,366 --> 00:10:00,197
- Well done, boy.
- Hurry.

107
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:20,672
That's funny.

108
00:10:23,034 --> 00:10:24,387
What?

109
00:10:24,659 --> 00:10:26,331
Well, you can't see now.

110
00:10:26,741 --> 00:10:29,414
Kane and his new wife
just took off in a big hurry.

111
00:10:30,659 --> 00:10:33,048
- What's so funny?
- I mean a big hurry.

112
00:10:34,826 --> 00:10:38,375
Hey, you don't suppose Kane's scared
of those three gunnies?

113
00:10:41,408 --> 00:10:44,718
Well, you didn't see him.
I never saw him whip a horse that way.

114
00:10:57,159 --> 00:10:59,229
- Sam!
- Come in, Helen.

115
00:10:59,534 --> 00:11:03,368
Ben Miller is in town.
He has two of the old bunch with him.

116
00:11:08,535 --> 00:11:10,287
I guess I'll take a look around.

117
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:58,561
- Why are you stopping?
- It's no good. I've got to go back, Amy.

118
00:11:58,911 --> 00:12:00,264
Why?

119
00:12:00,452 --> 00:12:02,090
This is crazy.
I haven't even got any guns.

120
00:12:02,286 --> 00:12:04,242
Then let's go on. Hurry.

121
00:12:04,536 --> 00:12:07,494
No, that's what I've been thinking.

122
00:12:08,119 --> 00:12:11,156
They're making me run.
I've never run from anybody before.

123
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:15,039
- Well, I don't understand any of this.
- Well, I haven't got time to tell you.

124
00:12:15,329 --> 00:12:19,083
- Then don't go back, Will.
- I've got to. That's the whole thing.

125
00:13:21,497 --> 00:13:23,965
- Kane's back.
- I don't believe it.

126
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:25,556
I just seen him.

127
00:13:29,205 --> 00:13:31,082
- How many coffins we got?
- Two.

128
00:13:31,288 --> 00:13:33,643
We're going to need at least two more
no matter how you figure.

129
00:13:33,871 --> 00:13:35,589
You'd better get busy, Fred.

130
00:13:38,329 --> 00:13:42,447
Please, Will, if you'd just tell me
what this is all about.

131
00:13:43,455 --> 00:13:45,730
I sent a man up five years ago
for murder.

132
00:13:45,954 --> 00:13:47,546
He was supposed to hang.

133
00:13:47,747 --> 00:13:51,456
But up north, they commuted it to life.
Now he's free.

134
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,753
I don't know how.
Anyway, it looks like he's coming back.

135
00:13:54,997 --> 00:13:56,555
- I still don't understand.
- He's a...

136
00:13:57,330 --> 00:14:01,164
Well, he was always wild, kind of crazy.
He'll probably make trouble.

137
00:14:02,455 --> 00:14:04,969
But that's no concern of yours,
not anymore.

138
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:07,900
I'm the one who sent him up.

139
00:14:08,205 --> 00:14:09,718
Well, that was part of your job.

140
00:14:09,913 --> 00:14:12,825
That's finished now.
They've got a new marshal.

141
00:14:13,082 --> 00:14:17,121
He won't be here till tomorrow.
Seems to me I've got to stay.

142
00:14:18,247 --> 00:14:20,602
Anyway, I'm the same man,
with or without this.

143
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:22,263
Well, that isn't so.

144
00:14:22,455 --> 00:14:24,093
I expect he'll come looking for me.

145
00:14:24,288 --> 00:14:26,244
Three of his old bunch are waiting
at the depot.

146
00:14:26,455 --> 00:14:28,332
That's exactly why we ought to go.

147
00:14:28,538 --> 00:14:31,098
They'll just come after us. Four of them.

148
00:14:31,872 --> 00:14:33,828
And we'd be all alone on the prairie.

149
00:14:34,789 --> 00:14:35,824
We've got an hour.

150
00:14:35,998 --> 00:14:37,431
- What's an hour?
- Well, we could...

151
00:14:37,624 --> 00:14:40,457
What's 100 miles? We'd never be able
to keep that store, Amy.

152
00:14:40,706 --> 00:14:43,266
They'd come after us and we'd have to
run again as long as we live.

153
00:14:43,497 --> 00:14:46,728
No, we wouldn't.
Not if they didn't know where to find us.

154
00:14:48,665 --> 00:14:51,816
Oh, Will.
Will, I'm begging you, please let's go.

155
00:14:52,081 --> 00:14:53,070
I can't.

156
00:14:53,247 --> 00:14:56,364
Don't try to be a hero.
You don't have to be a hero. Not for me.

157
00:14:56,623 --> 00:15:00,741
I'm not trying to be a hero.
If you think I like this, you're crazy.

158
00:15:01,124 --> 00:15:03,843
Look, Amy, this is my town.
I've got friends here.

159
00:15:04,289 --> 00:15:05,847
I'll swear in a bunch of special deputies

160
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:08,508
and with a posse behind me,
maybe there won't even be any trouble.

161
00:15:08,748 --> 00:15:12,946
- You know there'll be trouble.
- Then it's better to have it here.

162
00:15:18,247 --> 00:15:20,681
I'm sorry, honey.
I know how you feel about it.

163
00:15:20,915 --> 00:15:22,314
Do you?

164
00:15:22,498 --> 00:15:25,251
Of course I do.
I know it's against your religion and all.

165
00:15:25,582 --> 00:15:29,257
- Sure I know how you feel.
- But you're doing it just the same.

166
00:15:30,581 --> 00:15:34,620
Oh, Will, we were married
just a few minutes ago.

167
00:15:35,456 --> 00:15:38,971
We've got our whole lives ahead of us.
Doesn't that mean anything to you?

168
00:15:39,874 --> 00:15:42,786
You know I've only got an hour
and I've got lots to do.

169
00:15:43,665 --> 00:15:45,735
Stay at the hotel until it's over.

170
00:15:45,957 --> 00:15:48,391
No, I won't be here when it' s over.

171
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:50,183
You're asking me to wait an hour

172
00:15:50,374 --> 00:15:52,251
to find out if I'm going to be
a wife or a widow.

173
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:54,767
I say it's too long to wait. I won't do it.

174
00:15:54,998 --> 00:15:55,953
Amy!

175
00:15:56,123 --> 00:16:00,116
I mean it, if you won't go with me now,
I'll be on that train when it leaves here.

176
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,547
I've got to stay.

177
00:16:26,917 --> 00:16:28,828
- Glad you got here, Perce.
- Are you?

178
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:45,106
Have you forgotten that I'm the man
who passed sentence on Frank Miller?

179
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:49,385
You shouldn't have come back, Will.
It was stupid.

180
00:16:49,626 --> 00:16:53,016
I figured I had to. I figured I had to stay.

181
00:16:53,418 --> 00:16:54,771
You figured wrong.

182
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:57,598
I can deputise a posse.
Ten, 12 guns is all I need.

183
00:16:57,833 --> 00:17:00,063
Yeah, my intuition tells me otherwise.

184
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:01,705
Why?

185
00:17:03,501 --> 00:17:06,299
No time for a lesson in civics, my boy.

186
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,268
In the fifth century B.C.,
the citizens of Athens,

187
00:17:09,501 --> 00:17:11,412
having suffered grievously
under a tyrant,

188
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:13,104
managed to depose and banish him.

189
00:17:13,292 --> 00:17:15,408
However, when he returned
some years later

190
00:17:15,626 --> 00:17:16,695
with an army of mercenaries,

191
00:17:16,876 --> 00:17:20,232
those same citizens
not only opened the gates for him,

192
00:17:20,709 --> 00:17:24,179
but stood by while he executed
members of the legal government.

193
00:17:25,543 --> 00:17:28,137
A similar thing happened
about eight years ago

194
00:17:28,377 --> 00:17:30,766
in a town called Indian Falls.

195
00:17:31,543 --> 00:17:34,819
I escaped death
only through the intercession of a lady

196
00:17:35,084 --> 00:17:37,439
of somewhat dubious reputation,

197
00:17:37,668 --> 00:17:41,581
and at the cost of a very handsome ring
which once belonged to my mother.

198
00:17:41,876 --> 00:17:45,312
- Unfortunately, I have no more rings.
- You're a judge.

199
00:17:45,668 --> 00:17:48,580
I've been a judge many times
in many towns.

200
00:17:49,168 --> 00:17:51,443
And I hope to live to be a judge again.

201
00:17:52,918 --> 00:17:54,351
I can't tell you what to do.

202
00:17:54,543 --> 00:17:57,376
Why must you be so stupid, Will?
Have you forgotten what he is?

203
00:17:57,626 --> 00:17:58,945
Have you forgotten
what he's done to people?

204
00:17:59,128 --> 00:18:00,766
Have you forgotten that he's crazy?

205
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,951
Don't you remember
when he sat in that chair and said,

206
00:18:03,168 --> 00:18:03,888
"You'll never hang me. I'll come back.

207
00:18:03,918 --> 00:18:05,636
"You'll never hang me. I'll come back.

208
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:08,668
"I'll kill you, Will Kane.
I swear it, I'll kill you"?

209
00:18:16,169 --> 00:18:18,399
Here you are, ma'am.
This'll take you to Saint Louis.

210
00:18:18,627 --> 00:18:19,742
Thank you.

211
00:18:27,126 --> 00:18:28,844
Maybe you'd rather wait
somewheres else.

212
00:18:29,044 --> 00:18:30,557
Like at the hotel, maybe.

213
00:18:30,752 --> 00:18:31,946
All right, thank you.

214
00:18:32,127 --> 00:18:34,243
I'm awfully sorry
about all this, Mrs Kane.

215
00:18:34,462 --> 00:18:37,613
But don't you worry, the marshal
will take care of himself all right.

216
00:18:37,878 --> 00:18:39,391
Thank you very much.

217
00:18:41,252 --> 00:18:43,208
Hey, that wasn't here five years ago.

218
00:18:43,794 --> 00:18:45,227
So what?

219
00:18:45,419 --> 00:18:48,138
Nothing. Yet.

220
00:18:53,337 --> 00:18:56,966
Harvey, don't you think Kane
will be looking for you about now?

221
00:18:57,378 --> 00:18:58,333
Yeah.

222
00:18:59,461 --> 00:19:00,894
You're really sore at him.

223
00:19:01,379 --> 00:19:02,698
Wouldn't you be if you were me?

224
00:19:02,879 --> 00:19:04,790
I suppose. If I were you.

225
00:19:13,878 --> 00:19:15,470
Be back in a little while.

226
00:19:37,462 --> 00:19:39,180
- Bye, Will.
- Goodbye.

227
00:19:40,546 --> 00:19:43,299
- Think I'm letting you down, don't you?
- No.

228
00:19:43,836 --> 00:19:46,714
Look, this is just a dirty little village
in the middle of nowhere.

229
00:19:47,379 --> 00:19:50,257
Nothing that happens here
is really important. Now get out.

230
00:19:50,879 --> 00:19:52,392
There isn't time.

231
00:19:53,546 --> 00:19:56,140
What a waste. Good luck.

232
00:20:08,378 --> 00:20:09,606
Johnny.

233
00:20:12,796 --> 00:20:15,515
- Why aren't you in church?
- Why ain't you?

234
00:20:16,463 --> 00:20:17,896
- Look, will you do something for me?
- Sure.

235
00:20:18,089 --> 00:20:19,966
Go find Joe Henderson,
Mart Howe and Sam Fuller

236
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:21,808
- and tell them I want them here.
- Right.

237
00:20:22,005 --> 00:20:25,202
- And then find Harv Pell.
- Don't have to do that, here I am.

238
00:20:25,755 --> 00:20:27,632
- Well, where have you been?
- Busy.

239
00:20:29,006 --> 00:20:30,325
- You know what's doing?
- Sure.

240
00:20:30,505 --> 00:20:31,574
Well, come on, we got lots to do.

241
00:20:31,754 --> 00:20:35,349
Hold up a second.
This ain't really your job, you know.

242
00:20:35,713 --> 00:20:37,066
Well, that's what everybody
keeps telling me.

243
00:20:37,256 --> 00:20:39,975
When I tell you, it means something,
so you can just listen a second.

244
00:20:40,213 --> 00:20:41,646
All right, I'm listening.

245
00:20:42,256 --> 00:20:43,655
Now, this is the way I see it.

246
00:20:44,129 --> 00:20:46,563
If you'd gone, with the new marshal
not due here till tomorrow,

247
00:20:46,797 --> 00:20:48,469
I'd be in charge around here, right?

248
00:20:48,672 --> 00:20:49,787
Right.

249
00:20:49,963 --> 00:20:51,476
Well, tell me this, then,

250
00:20:51,672 --> 00:20:53,947
if I'm good enough to hold down the job
when there's trouble,

251
00:20:54,172 --> 00:20:56,402
how come the city fathers
didn't trust me with it permanent?

252
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:58,302
I don't know.

253
00:20:58,505 --> 00:21:00,621
- Don't you?
- No.

254
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,796
That's funny, I figured
you carried a lot of weight.

255
00:21:03,547 --> 00:21:07,096
Maybe they didn't ask me.
Maybe they figured you were too young.

256
00:21:07,382 --> 00:21:08,895
You think I'm too young, too?

257
00:21:09,089 --> 00:21:11,159
You sure act like it sometimes.
Come on.

258
00:21:20,298 --> 00:21:21,970
It's very simple, Will.

259
00:21:22,173 --> 00:21:23,765
All you gotta do is tell the old boys
when they come

260
00:21:23,964 --> 00:21:25,283
that I'm the new marshal.

261
00:21:25,965 --> 00:21:27,762
And tomorrow
they can tell the other fellow

262
00:21:27,964 --> 00:21:29,920
they're sorry, but the job's filled.

263
00:21:30,131 --> 00:21:32,691
- You really mean it, don't you?
- Sure.

264
00:21:35,006 --> 00:21:37,679
- Well, I can't do it.
- Why not?

265
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:40,570
If you don't know,
it's no use me telling you.

266
00:21:40,798 --> 00:21:41,913
You mean you won't do it.

267
00:21:42,423 --> 00:21:43,822
Have it your way.

268
00:21:44,007 --> 00:21:47,317
All right, the truth is you probably
talked against me from the start.

269
00:21:49,298 --> 00:21:52,449
You've been sore about me and
Helen Ramírez right along, ain't you?

270
00:21:53,882 --> 00:21:55,440
You and Helen Ramírez?

271
00:21:57,008 --> 00:21:58,600
It so happens I didn't know,

272
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,756
and it doesn't mean anything to me
one way or the other.

273
00:22:00,965 --> 00:22:02,000
You ought to know that.

274
00:22:02,174 --> 00:22:04,165
Yeah, you been washed up
for more than a year.

275
00:22:04,382 --> 00:22:06,179
Oh, you go out and get yourself married,

276
00:22:06,382 --> 00:22:09,055
only you can't stand anybody
taking your place there, can you?

277
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:11,530
- Especially me.
- You're a...

278
00:22:17,841 --> 00:22:19,877
I haven't got time, Harv.

279
00:22:20,091 --> 00:22:22,559
Okay, then let's get down to business.

280
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:25,405
You want me to stick,
you put the word in for me like I said.

281
00:22:25,632 --> 00:22:27,145
Sure, I want you to stick.

282
00:22:27,341 --> 00:22:29,980
But I'm not buying it.
It's got to be up to you.

283
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:06,968
I thought you'd grew up by now.

284
00:23:08,008 --> 00:23:11,762
I thought your disposition might have
sweetened up a little down in Abilene.

285
00:23:12,342 --> 00:23:13,821
I guess we're both wrong.

286
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,199
What's so funny?

287
00:23:24,218 --> 00:23:26,607
Did you really think
you could put that over on Kane?

288
00:23:26,842 --> 00:23:27,797
Why not?

289
00:23:28,175 --> 00:23:29,847
When are you going to grow up?

290
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:31,699
I'm getting tired of that kind of talk.

291
00:23:31,884 --> 00:23:34,079
- Then grow up.
- Cut it out!

292
00:23:39,593 --> 00:23:40,662
All right.

293
00:23:41,217 --> 00:23:43,287
Why shouldn't he have gone for it?
He needs me.

294
00:23:43,509 --> 00:23:45,261
He'll need me plenty
when Frank Miller gets here.

295
00:23:45,468 --> 00:23:46,457
That's possible.

296
00:23:46,635 --> 00:23:48,114
Should've had me made marshal
to begin with.

297
00:23:48,302 --> 00:23:50,657
He's just sore, is all.
Sore about you and me.

298
00:23:51,343 --> 00:23:52,776
- Is he?
- Sure.

299
00:23:53,592 --> 00:23:55,708
- You told him?
- Sure.

300
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:57,909
You are a fool.

301
00:24:00,051 --> 00:24:02,611
Why? Didn't you want him to know?

302
00:24:04,635 --> 00:24:08,310
Hey, who did the walking out, anyway?
You or him?

303
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:14,625
Get out, Harvey.

304
00:24:16,177 --> 00:24:18,407
- I might just do that.
- Then do it.

305
00:24:21,010 --> 00:24:23,319
- You don't mean that.
- Try me.

306
00:24:24,927 --> 00:24:27,316
You're gonna talk different
when Frank Miller gets here.

307
00:24:27,551 --> 00:24:28,825
You might want somebody
around you then

308
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:30,728
when you try to explain to him
about Kane.

309
00:24:30,927 --> 00:24:32,883
- I can take care of myself.
- Sure.

310
00:24:33,552 --> 00:24:34,507
Only from what I've heard,

311
00:24:34,677 --> 00:24:36,793
you might not be so pretty
when he gets through with you.

312
00:24:41,427 --> 00:24:43,622
- I won't be back.
- Good.

313
00:24:55,637 --> 00:24:57,036
Come in.

314
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:01,279
I just saw Harvey. Is everything all right?

315
00:25:01,885 --> 00:25:04,274
I think I have to talk with Mr Weaver.

316
00:25:06,178 --> 00:25:08,408
- You're getting out?
- Yes.

317
00:25:09,053 --> 00:25:10,771
You want me to give Kane a hand?

318
00:25:17,344 --> 00:25:20,017
- No.
- All right.

319
00:25:30,554 --> 00:25:32,590
May I wait here for the noon train?

320
00:25:35,637 --> 00:25:38,470
I said, may I wait in the lobby
until noon?

321
00:25:40,261 --> 00:25:41,614
Sure, lady.

322
00:25:42,262 --> 00:25:43,411
Thank you.

323
00:25:45,095 --> 00:25:48,405
- You're Mrs Kane, ain't you?
- Yes.

324
00:25:48,678 --> 00:25:50,987
- You're leaving on the noon train?
- Yes.

325
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:52,573
But your husband ain't?

326
00:25:53,303 --> 00:25:54,372
No. Why?

327
00:25:54,554 --> 00:25:56,545
No reason, but it's mighty interesting.

328
00:25:57,429 --> 00:26:01,661
Now, me, I wouldn't leave this town
at noon for all the tea in China.

329
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:05,201
No, sir.
It's going to be quite a sight to see.

330
00:27:05,097 --> 00:27:08,009
- Will, I just heard about...
- Hello, Herb.

331
00:27:08,264 --> 00:27:10,539
You can count on me.
You know that, don't you?

332
00:27:11,181 --> 00:27:12,739
I was figuring I could.

333
00:27:12,931 --> 00:27:14,125
The way you cleaned this town up,

334
00:27:14,305 --> 00:27:16,182
you made it fit
for women and kids to live in.

335
00:27:16,388 --> 00:27:18,583
Miller nor nobody else
will ever drag it down again.

336
00:27:18,805 --> 00:27:20,761
I was hoping people would feel that way.

337
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:23,725
What other way is there?
How many men you got lined up?

338
00:27:25,806 --> 00:27:27,000
None, yet.

339
00:27:29,181 --> 00:27:30,978
Well, you better get going, man.

340
00:27:31,181 --> 00:27:34,298
I'll be back in 10 minutes,
loaded and prepared.

341
00:28:06,015 --> 00:28:07,243
Where is he?

342
00:28:08,807 --> 00:28:12,117
He's coming up the back way.
There's a careful man.

343
00:28:17,182 --> 00:28:18,217
Come in, Mr Weaver.

344
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:19,379
- Hello, Mrs Ramírez.
- Hello.

345
00:28:19,557 --> 00:28:21,149
- Sit down, please.
- Thanks.

346
00:28:23,974 --> 00:28:26,647
- Is there anything wrong, Mrs Ramírez?
- No.

347
00:28:26,891 --> 00:28:28,165
Then why did you send for me?

348
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:30,784
I'm leaving town. I want to sell the store.

349
00:28:31,015 --> 00:28:33,927
- You want to buy me out?
- Well, how much did you want?

350
00:28:34,557 --> 00:28:36,468
$2,000. I think that's fair.

351
00:28:37,599 --> 00:28:40,909
Well, it's fair, all right,
but I couldn't raise that much right now.

352
00:28:41,184 --> 00:28:44,654
- How much can you raise?
- Oh, $1,000.

353
00:28:46,849 --> 00:28:50,398
All right.
You can pay Sam the rest in six months

354
00:28:50,682 --> 00:28:52,832
and he'll get it to me. A deal?

355
00:28:53,474 --> 00:28:54,793
Yes, ma'am.

356
00:28:55,183 --> 00:28:58,255
All right, Mr Weaver. Thank you.

357
00:29:00,474 --> 00:29:03,511
Mrs Ramírez,
I want to thank you for everything.

358
00:29:03,766 --> 00:29:07,361
I mean, when you first called me in
and put the deal to me about

359
00:29:07,891 --> 00:29:10,644
staking me in the store
and being a silent partner.

360
00:29:10,891 --> 00:29:12,290
You know, my wife thought...

361
00:29:15,601 --> 00:29:17,956
What I really mean to say is that

362
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,670
you've been real decent to me
right along.

363
00:29:21,142 --> 00:29:23,098
And I want you to know
that I've been honest with you.

364
00:29:23,432 --> 00:29:25,662
I know you have, Mr Weaver. Goodbye.

365
00:29:26,141 --> 00:29:29,338
Goodbye, Mrs Ramírez,
and good luck to you.

366
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:30,556
Thank you.

367
00:29:44,643 --> 00:29:46,201
- Oh, Will.
- Amy.

368
00:29:46,391 --> 00:29:48,109
You've changed your mind.

369
00:29:50,058 --> 00:29:52,288
I thought you had changed yours.

370
00:29:55,518 --> 00:29:57,509
No, Will, I have my ticket.

371
00:30:01,266 --> 00:30:02,619
I see.

372
00:30:04,143 --> 00:30:07,135
Open 19 and clean it up good.
Mr Miller's very particular.

373
00:30:08,018 --> 00:30:10,134
- Is Helen Ramírez in?
- I guess so.

374
00:30:12,309 --> 00:30:14,027
Think you can find it all right?

375
00:30:24,141 --> 00:30:25,290
Come in.

376
00:30:37,642 --> 00:30:40,918
What are you looking at?
You think I have changed?

377
00:30:45,018 --> 00:30:47,009
Well, what do you want?

378
00:30:47,226 --> 00:30:50,104
You want me to help you?
You want me to ask Frank to let you go?

379
00:30:50,352 --> 00:30:51,990
You want me to beg for you?

380
00:30:52,185 --> 00:30:55,177
Well, I would not do it.
I would not lift a finger for you.

381
00:30:56,852 --> 00:30:57,967
I came to tell you he was coming.

382
00:30:58,143 --> 00:30:59,974
I should have figured
you'd know about it.

383
00:31:00,603 --> 00:31:02,241
I know about it.

384
00:31:02,434 --> 00:31:05,232
I think you ought to get out of town.
I might not be able to... Well,

385
00:31:06,685 --> 00:31:09,518
- anything can happen.
- I am not afraid of him.

386
00:31:10,436 --> 00:31:14,065
I know you're not,
but you know how he is.

387
00:31:16,185 --> 00:31:17,698
I know how he is.

388
00:31:20,144 --> 00:31:22,135
Maybe he doesn't know.

389
00:31:23,227 --> 00:31:25,946
- He's probably got letters.
- Probably.

390
00:31:28,853 --> 00:31:30,252
Nothing in life is free.

391
00:31:31,395 --> 00:31:36,025
- I'm getting out. I'm packing now.
- That's good.

392
00:31:52,269 --> 00:31:53,782
Goodbye, Helen.

393
00:31:53,977 --> 00:31:58,846
Kane, if you're smart,
you will get out, too.

394
00:32:00,853 --> 00:32:02,969
- I can't.
- I know.

395
00:32:33,687 --> 00:32:36,838
- May I ask you something?
- Sure.

396
00:32:37,479 --> 00:32:40,551
- Who is Miss Ramírez?
- Mrs Ramírez?

397
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:45,017
She used to be a friend
of your husband's a while back.

398
00:32:45,271 --> 00:32:47,387
Before that,
she was a friend of Frank Miller's.

399
00:32:48,729 --> 00:32:50,879
I see. Thank you.

400
00:32:54,064 --> 00:32:56,942
- You don't like my husband, do you?
- No.

401
00:32:57,187 --> 00:32:59,781
- Why?
- Lots of reasons.

402
00:33:00,022 --> 00:33:03,094
One thing, this place was always busy
when Frank Miller was around.

403
00:33:03,772 --> 00:33:05,091
I'm not the only one.

404
00:33:05,271 --> 00:33:08,946
There's plenty people around here
think he's got a comeuppance coming.

405
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:11,824
You asked me, ma'am,
so I'm telling you.

406
00:33:34,396 --> 00:33:36,193
You know, I think I'll go get some liquor.

407
00:33:36,396 --> 00:33:39,149
- Do you have to have it?
- Yeah.

408
00:33:39,397 --> 00:33:42,628
- If you're going after that woman...
- I said I was going for liquor.

409
00:33:42,897 --> 00:33:45,855
- You keep away from Kane.
- Sure, I can wait.

410
00:34:00,898 --> 00:34:01,853
Hiya, Harvey.

411
00:34:14,273 --> 00:34:16,184
- Hello, Harv.
- How are you?

412
00:34:16,397 --> 00:34:20,276
- Where's the tin star?
- I turned it in. I quit.

413
00:34:20,566 --> 00:34:22,124
Smart move.

414
00:34:23,522 --> 00:34:25,433
I didn't ask you for your opinion.

415
00:34:52,858 --> 00:34:55,611
Hey, Ben! Hey, how are you, Ben?

416
00:34:57,940 --> 00:34:59,134
Look who's here.

417
00:35:00,857 --> 00:35:03,212
- How are you, Ben?
- All right, give me a bottle.

418
00:35:03,815 --> 00:35:05,248
Sure thing.

419
00:35:07,732 --> 00:35:10,963
- It's been a long time, Ben.
- Yeah.

420
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:13,188
Yes, sir. How's Frank?

421
00:35:14,857 --> 00:35:16,415
He's not complaining.

422
00:35:16,607 --> 00:35:20,316
Well, there'll be a hot time
in the old town tonight, eh, Ben?

423
00:35:23,441 --> 00:35:24,556
I wouldn't be surprised.

424
00:36:17,733 --> 00:36:21,567
I'll give you odds. Kane's dead five
minutes after Frank gets off the train.

425
00:36:21,859 --> 00:36:25,454
- That's not much time.
- That's all Frank'll need because I...

426
00:36:39,734 --> 00:36:42,248
You carry a badge and a gun, Marshal.

427
00:36:43,109 --> 00:36:44,383
You had no call to do that.

428
00:36:46,734 --> 00:36:47,928
You're right.

429
00:36:50,944 --> 00:36:52,696
No.

430
00:37:02,319 --> 00:37:04,196
I guess you all know why I'm here.

431
00:37:04,402 --> 00:37:07,633
I need deputies. I'll take all I can get.

432
00:37:11,943 --> 00:37:14,662
You must be crazy coming in here
to raise a posse.

433
00:37:14,902 --> 00:37:17,860
Frank's got friends in this room.
You ought to know that.

434
00:37:20,109 --> 00:37:22,942
Some of you were special deputies
when we broke this bunch.

435
00:37:23,194 --> 00:37:25,344
I need you again. Now.

436
00:37:27,527 --> 00:37:29,085
Things were different then, Kane.

437
00:37:29,278 --> 00:37:31,872
You had six steady deputies
to start off with.

438
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:35,898
Every one a top gun.
You ain't got but two now.

439
00:37:36,361 --> 00:37:40,274
You ain't got two.
Harv Pell here says he just quit. Why?

440
00:37:43,694 --> 00:37:45,366
That's between the two of us.

441
00:37:45,568 --> 00:37:46,796
You're asking an awful lot, Kane,

442
00:37:46,985 --> 00:37:49,180
considering the kind of man
Frank Miller is.

443
00:37:49,403 --> 00:37:52,679
All right, we all know what Miller's like.

444
00:37:52,944 --> 00:37:55,504
That's why I'm here. How about it?

445
00:39:04,821 --> 00:39:08,052
Mildred. Mildred, he's coming.
Now, you do like I told you.

446
00:39:08,321 --> 00:39:11,358
I'm not home. Don't let him in.
No matter what he says, I'm not home.

447
00:39:11,613 --> 00:39:12,762
Sam, he's your friend.

448
00:39:12,945 --> 00:39:15,015
Don't argue with me.
He'll be here in a second.

449
00:39:15,238 --> 00:39:17,115
He won't believe me.
He'll know I'm lying.

450
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,673
You do like I tell you.

451
00:39:35,863 --> 00:39:39,822
- Hello, Mrs Fuller, is Sam in?
- No. No, he isn't.

452
00:39:42,696 --> 00:39:45,847
Do you know where he is, Mrs Fuller?
It's important to me that I find him.

453
00:39:46,114 --> 00:39:50,392
I think... He's in church, Will.
He's gone to church.

454
00:39:52,863 --> 00:39:53,978
Without you?

455
00:39:54,154 --> 00:39:56,384
I'm gonna go in a little while,
as soon as I dress.

456
00:40:02,657 --> 00:40:05,296
Thank you, Mrs Fuller. Goodbye.

457
00:40:29,364 --> 00:40:32,595
Now, what do you want?
Do you want me to get killed?

458
00:40:32,864 --> 00:40:35,059
Do you want to be a widow?
Is that what you want?

459
00:40:35,282 --> 00:40:37,034
No, Sam, no.

460
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,195
Kane.

461
00:40:42,071 --> 00:40:45,825
- What's the matter, Jimmy?
- Nothing. I've been looking for you.

462
00:40:46,114 --> 00:40:49,584
I want a gun. I want to be with you
when that train comes in.

463
00:40:51,198 --> 00:40:55,191
- Can you handle a gun?
- Sure I can. I used to be good.

464
00:40:55,614 --> 00:40:57,047
- Honest.
- But why...

465
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:59,754
It ain't just getting even.
It's a chance, see? It's what I need.

466
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:02,220
Please, Kane, let me get in on this.

467
00:41:03,532 --> 00:41:06,330
All right, Jimmy,
I'll call you if I need you.

468
00:41:07,073 --> 00:41:09,029
Get yourself a drink meanwhile, huh?

469
00:41:20,115 --> 00:41:22,071
Come in, Sam.

470
00:41:29,323 --> 00:41:30,961
You're leaving town?

471
00:41:32,491 --> 00:41:35,324
- Where are you going?
- I don't know yet.

472
00:41:36,158 --> 00:41:38,388
That doesn't make much sense.

473
00:41:41,449 --> 00:41:44,009
You're afraid, huh? Afraid of Miller?

474
00:41:44,741 --> 00:41:45,730
No.

475
00:41:45,908 --> 00:41:47,944
Sure you are,
or you wouldn't be running.

476
00:41:48,158 --> 00:41:51,230
You got nothing to be worried about
as long as I'm around. You know that.

477
00:41:51,492 --> 00:41:53,642
I'm not scared of Miller.
I'll take him on any time.

478
00:41:53,866 --> 00:41:55,219
I believe you.

479
00:41:55,784 --> 00:41:57,183
Then why are you going?

480
00:41:58,782 --> 00:42:00,420
- You cutting out with Kane?
- Oh, Harvey.

481
00:42:00,616 --> 00:42:02,652
- Then why are you going?
- What difference does it make?

482
00:42:02,866 --> 00:42:04,066
It's Kane. It's Kane, I know it's Kane.

483
00:42:04,366 --> 00:42:05,958
It isn't Kane,

484
00:42:06,158 --> 00:42:09,195
but I'm going to tell you something
about you and your friend Kane.

485
00:42:09,450 --> 00:42:10,769
You're a good-looking boy.

486
00:42:10,950 --> 00:42:14,386
You have big, broad shoulders,
but he is a man.

487
00:42:14,658 --> 00:42:17,331
It takes more than big, broad shoulders
to make a man, Harvey,

488
00:42:17,575 --> 00:42:19,531
and you have a long way to go.

489
00:42:21,659 --> 00:42:24,332
You know something?
I don't think you will ever make it.

490
00:42:27,075 --> 00:42:29,145
Let me tell you something.
You're not going anywhere.

491
00:42:29,366 --> 00:42:32,722
You're staying here with me.
It's going to be just like it was before.

492
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:39,816
You want to know why I'm leaving?
Then listen.

493
00:42:40,742 --> 00:42:42,573
Kane will be a dead man in half an hour,

494
00:42:42,784 --> 00:42:45,014
and nobody is going to do
anything about it.

495
00:42:45,242 --> 00:42:49,235
And when he dies, this town dies, too.
I can feel it.

496
00:42:49,658 --> 00:42:51,376
I am all alone in the world.

497
00:42:51,575 --> 00:42:55,727
I have to make a living.
So I'm going someplace else. That's all.

498
00:42:59,909 --> 00:43:03,185
And as for you, I don't like anybody
to put his hands on me

499
00:43:03,450 --> 00:43:04,565
unless I want him to.

500
00:43:04,742 --> 00:43:07,415
And I don't like you to anymore.

501
00:43:24,577 --> 00:43:27,728
Our text today is from Malachi,
Chapter Four.

502
00:43:28,117 --> 00:43:31,746
"For, behold, the day cometh,
that shall burn as an oven,

503
00:43:32,368 --> 00:43:35,440
"and all the proud, yea,
and all that do wickedly, shall be..."

504
00:43:40,201 --> 00:43:41,395
Yes?

505
00:43:41,867 --> 00:43:44,665
I'm sorry, Parson.
I don't want to disturb the services.

506
00:43:45,494 --> 00:43:47,132
You already have.

507
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:50,000
You don't come
to this church very often, Marshal.

508
00:43:50,244 --> 00:43:53,441
And when you got married today,
you didn't see fit to be married here.

509
00:43:53,993 --> 00:43:56,507
What could be so important
to bring you here now?

510
00:43:57,494 --> 00:43:58,927
I need help.

511
00:44:04,494 --> 00:44:06,291
It's true, I haven't been
a church-going man.

512
00:44:06,494 --> 00:44:08,212
And maybe that's a bad thing.

513
00:44:08,412 --> 00:44:11,722
And I didn't get married here today
because my wife's a Quaker.

514
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:16,169
But I came here for help
because there are people here.

515
00:44:18,202 --> 00:44:19,601
I'm sorry, Marshal.

516
00:44:20,536 --> 00:44:22,174
Say what you have to say.

517
00:44:24,037 --> 00:44:25,914
Maybe some of you already know it,

518
00:44:26,119 --> 00:44:27,598
but if you don't,

519
00:44:27,786 --> 00:44:30,744
it looks like Frank Miller's
coming back on the noon train.

520
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:37,771
I need all the special deputies I can get.

521
00:44:43,162 --> 00:44:47,713
Well, what are we waiting for? Let's go.

522
00:44:49,995 --> 00:44:51,951
Hold it a minute. Hold it.

523
00:44:52,537 --> 00:44:53,811
Before we go
rushing out into something

524
00:44:53,995 --> 00:44:55,428
that ain't gonna be so pleasant,

525
00:44:55,620 --> 00:44:57,690
let's be sure
we know what this is all about.

526
00:44:59,162 --> 00:45:00,993
What I want to know is this.

527
00:45:01,204 --> 00:45:03,957
Ain't it true
that Kane ain't no longer marshal?

528
00:45:05,788 --> 00:45:08,939
And ain't it true there's personal trouble
between him and Miller?

529
00:45:14,037 --> 00:45:17,347
All right, all right. Quiet, everybody!

530
00:45:17,913 --> 00:45:20,711
If there's a difference of opinion,
let everybody have a say.

531
00:45:20,954 --> 00:45:22,626
But let's do it like grown-up people.

532
00:45:22,829 --> 00:45:25,423
And let's get all the kids
out of the building.

533
00:45:58,205 --> 00:46:01,754
- Anything on the train?
- It's on time as far as I know, sir.

534
00:46:06,789 --> 00:46:09,349
I say it don't really matter
if there's anything personal

535
00:46:09,579 --> 00:46:11,376
between Miller and the marshal here.

536
00:46:11,579 --> 00:46:14,047
We all know who Miller is
and what Miller is.

537
00:46:14,288 --> 00:46:16,358
What's more, we're wasting time.

538
00:46:16,997 --> 00:46:19,352
All right. Coy.

539
00:46:19,581 --> 00:46:23,256
Yes, we all know who Miller is.
But we put him away once.

540
00:46:23,538 --> 00:46:26,894
And who saved him from hanging?
The politicians up north.

541
00:46:27,247 --> 00:46:30,080
I say this is their mess.
Let them take care of it.

542
00:46:30,873 --> 00:46:33,148
- Sawyer.
- Well, I say this.

543
00:46:33,373 --> 00:46:34,965
We've been paying
good money right along

544
00:46:35,163 --> 00:46:36,642
for a marshal and deputies.

545
00:46:36,830 --> 00:46:38,502
Now the first time there's any trouble,

546
00:46:38,705 --> 00:46:40,457
we're supposed
to take care of it ourselves.

547
00:46:40,663 --> 00:46:42,858
Well, what have we been paying for
all this time?

548
00:46:43,081 --> 00:46:45,959
I say we're not peace officers.
This ain't our job.

549
00:46:47,622 --> 00:46:50,420
I've been saying right along,
we ought to have more deputies.

550
00:46:50,664 --> 00:46:53,497
If we did,
we wouldn't be facing this thing now.

551
00:46:54,289 --> 00:46:57,884
Just a minute. Just a minute.
Everybody, quiet!

552
00:46:58,164 --> 00:47:01,122
Keep it orderly.
You had your hand up, Ezra.

553
00:47:02,122 --> 00:47:04,716
I can't believe I've heard some
of the things that have been said here.

554
00:47:04,957 --> 00:47:06,436
You all ought to be ashamed
of yourselves.

555
00:47:06,623 --> 00:47:10,172
Sure, we paid this man and he was
the best marshal this town ever had.

556
00:47:10,456 --> 00:47:12,253
It ain't his trouble, it's ours.

557
00:47:12,455 --> 00:47:15,606
I tell you, if we don't do what's right,
we're gonna have plenty more trouble.

558
00:47:15,872 --> 00:47:19,547
So there ain't but one thing to do now.
And you all know what that is.

559
00:47:19,916 --> 00:47:21,110
Go ahead, Kibbee.

560
00:47:21,290 --> 00:47:22,928
This whole thing's been handled wrong.

561
00:47:23,124 --> 00:47:26,116
Here's those three killers
walking the streets bold as brass.

562
00:47:26,373 --> 00:47:27,852
Why didn't you arrest them, Marshal?

563
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:29,871
Why didn't you put them in jail
where they ought to be?

564
00:47:30,082 --> 00:47:32,550
Then we'd only have Miller to worry
about instead of the four of them.

565
00:47:32,790 --> 00:47:35,304
I haven't anything to arrest them for,
Mr Trumbull.

566
00:47:35,540 --> 00:47:36,973
They haven't done anything.

567
00:47:37,164 --> 00:47:40,440
There's no law against them
sitting on a bench at the depot.

568
00:47:40,832 --> 00:47:42,550
I can't listen to any more of this.

569
00:47:42,749 --> 00:47:44,580
What's the matter with you people?

570
00:47:44,790 --> 00:47:46,382
Don't you remember
when a decent woman

571
00:47:46,582 --> 00:47:48,812
couldn't walk down the street
in broad daylight?

572
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:52,350
Don't you remember when this wasn't
a fit place to bring up a child?

573
00:47:52,625 --> 00:47:55,935
How can you sit here
and talk and talk and talk like this?

574
00:47:56,207 --> 00:47:58,323
What are we all getting
so excited about?

575
00:47:58,540 --> 00:48:01,100
How do we know
Miller's on that train, anyway?

576
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:03,855
Well, we can be pretty sure he's on it.

577
00:48:04,249 --> 00:48:06,046
Time's getting short.

578
00:48:07,623 --> 00:48:10,296
Parson, you got anything to say?

579
00:48:10,541 --> 00:48:14,659
I don't know. The Commandments say,
"Thou shalt not kill."

580
00:48:14,957 --> 00:48:17,391
But we hire men to go out
and do it for us.

581
00:48:17,874 --> 00:48:20,513
The right and the wrong
seem pretty clear here.

582
00:48:21,292 --> 00:48:24,090
But if you're asking me to tell my people
to go out and kill

583
00:48:24,333 --> 00:48:26,289
and maybe get themselves killed,

584
00:48:26,624 --> 00:48:30,697
I'm sorry, I don't know what to say.
I'm sorry.

585
00:48:32,208 --> 00:48:34,324
All right. I'll say this,

586
00:48:34,541 --> 00:48:37,294
what this town owes Will Kane here,
it can never pay with money.

587
00:48:37,542 --> 00:48:39,134
And don't ever forget it.

588
00:48:39,793 --> 00:48:43,388
He's the best marshal we ever had,
maybe the best marshal we'll ever have.

589
00:48:43,667 --> 00:48:48,138
So if Miller comes back here today,
it's our problem, not his.

590
00:48:48,667 --> 00:48:51,625
It's our problem
because this is our town.

591
00:48:51,876 --> 00:48:54,151
We made it with our own hands
out of nothing.

592
00:48:54,375 --> 00:48:56,650
And if we want to keep it decent,
keep it growing,

593
00:48:56,876 --> 00:48:58,753
we've got to think mighty clear
here today.

594
00:48:58,959 --> 00:49:01,553
And we've got to have the courage
to do what we think is right,

595
00:49:01,792 --> 00:49:04,704
no matter how hard it is. All right.

596
00:49:05,542 --> 00:49:08,500
There's gonna be fighting
when Kane and Miller meet.

597
00:49:08,751 --> 00:49:12,585
And somebody's going to get hurt,
that's for sure. Now,

598
00:49:13,375 --> 00:49:16,253
people up north
are thinking about this town.

599
00:49:16,502 --> 00:49:19,699
Thinking mighty hard, thinking about
sending money down here

600
00:49:19,958 --> 00:49:22,313
to put up stores and to build factories.

601
00:49:22,792 --> 00:49:25,829
It'll mean a lot to this town. An awful lot.

602
00:49:26,418 --> 00:49:29,967
But if they're gonna read about
shooting and killing in the streets,

603
00:49:30,251 --> 00:49:32,162
what are they gonna think then?

604
00:49:32,418 --> 00:49:37,048
I'll tell you. They're gonna think
this is just another wide-open town,

605
00:49:37,377 --> 00:49:40,335
and everything we worked for
will be wiped out.

606
00:49:40,586 --> 00:49:45,023
In one day,
this town will be set back five years.

607
00:49:45,543 --> 00:49:47,977
And I don't think we can let that happen.

608
00:49:48,334 --> 00:49:51,451
Mind you, you all know
how I feel about this man.

609
00:49:52,168 --> 00:49:54,477
He's a mighty brave man. A good man.

610
00:49:55,211 --> 00:49:57,520
He didn't have to come back here today.

611
00:49:58,168 --> 00:50:01,683
And for his sake and the sake
of this town, I wish he hadn't.

612
00:50:03,419 --> 00:50:05,649
Because if he's not here
when Miller comes,

613
00:50:05,877 --> 00:50:08,789
my hunch is there won't be any trouble.
Not one bit.

614
00:50:09,043 --> 00:50:10,681
Tomorrow we'll have a new marshal,

615
00:50:10,877 --> 00:50:13,869
and if we can all agree here
to offer him our services,

616
00:50:14,210 --> 00:50:16,883
I think we can handle anything
that comes along.

617
00:50:17,794 --> 00:50:19,432
Now, to me, that makes sense.

618
00:50:20,169 --> 00:50:22,444
To me, that's the only way out of this.

619
00:50:24,043 --> 00:50:27,956
Will, I think you better go
while there's still time.

620
00:50:29,961 --> 00:50:32,919
It's better for you, and it's better for us.

621
00:50:43,670 --> 00:50:44,819
Thanks.

622
00:51:15,337 --> 00:51:17,805
Why don't you put that thing away?

623
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:36,071
- Bang, bang, bang!
- Bang, bang, you're dead, Kane!

624
00:52:14,422 --> 00:52:18,381
- I sent a kid to find you. Didn't he come?
- He was here.

625
00:52:22,505 --> 00:52:25,463
You've been my friend all my life.
You got me this job.

626
00:52:25,714 --> 00:52:27,545
You made them send for me.

627
00:52:28,422 --> 00:52:31,619
Ever since I was a kid,
I wanted to be like you, Mart.

628
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:33,757
You've been a lawman all your life.

629
00:52:33,963 --> 00:52:36,272
Yeah, yeah, all my life.

630
00:52:36,505 --> 00:52:39,781
It's a great life.
You risk your skin catching killers,

631
00:52:40,047 --> 00:52:43,881
and the juries turn them loose so they
can come back and shoot at you again.

632
00:52:44,171 --> 00:52:46,731
If you're honest,
you're poor your whole life.

633
00:52:46,964 --> 00:52:50,957
And in the end, you wind up dying
all alone on some dirty street.

634
00:52:51,256 --> 00:52:52,211
For what?

635
00:52:53,005 --> 00:52:55,883
For nothing. For a tin star.

636
00:52:56,548 --> 00:52:58,618
Listen, the judge has left town,

637
00:52:58,838 --> 00:53:01,306
Harvey's quit,
and I'm having trouble getting deputies.

638
00:53:01,548 --> 00:53:04,187
It figures. It's all happened too sudden.

639
00:53:04,838 --> 00:53:07,398
People got to talk themselves
into law and order

640
00:53:07,630 --> 00:53:09,188
before they do anything about it.

641
00:53:09,380 --> 00:53:14,056
Maybe because down deep
they don't care. They just don't care.

642
00:53:20,839 --> 00:53:22,318
What'll I do, Mart?

643
00:53:25,424 --> 00:53:27,699
I was hoping you wouldn't come back.

644
00:53:28,174 --> 00:53:29,607
You know why I came back.

645
00:53:29,798 --> 00:53:31,754
Well, not to commit suicide.

646
00:53:33,006 --> 00:53:36,282
Sometimes...
Sometimes prison changes a man.

647
00:53:36,549 --> 00:53:40,827
Not him. This is all planned.
That's why they're all here.

648
00:53:41,715 --> 00:53:44,070
Get out, Will. Get out.

649
00:53:55,255 --> 00:53:57,371
Will you come down
to that depot with me?

650
00:53:57,590 --> 00:53:58,625
No.

651
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:04,674
You know how I feel about you.
But I ain't going with you.

652
00:54:05,632 --> 00:54:09,705
Seems like a man with busted knuckles
didn't need arthritis, too, don't it?

653
00:54:11,089 --> 00:54:14,445
No, I couldn't do nothing for you.
You'd be worried about me.

654
00:54:14,716 --> 00:54:17,549
You'd get yourself killed
worrying about me.

655
00:54:17,799 --> 00:54:20,233
It's too one-sided like it is.

656
00:54:26,591 --> 00:54:28,786
- So long, Mart.
- So long.

657
00:54:30,717 --> 00:54:35,233
It's all for nothing, Will.
It's all for nothing.

658
00:54:46,424 --> 00:54:50,337
Excuse me,
what is Mrs Ramírez's room number?

659
00:54:51,632 --> 00:54:53,668
- Three.
- Thank you.

660
00:55:10,924 --> 00:55:12,152
Come in.

661
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:19,270
- Yes?
- Mrs Ramírez? I'm Mrs Kane.

662
00:55:20,133 --> 00:55:21,282
I know.

663
00:55:23,634 --> 00:55:26,068
- May I come in?
- If you like.

664
00:55:32,342 --> 00:55:34,936
- Sit down, Mrs Kane.
- No, thank you.

665
00:55:35,468 --> 00:55:37,424
- What do you want?
- Oh, please...

666
00:55:37,634 --> 00:55:40,831
It's just that I'm afraid if I sat down,
I wouldn't be able to get up again.

667
00:55:41,092 --> 00:55:43,890
- Why?
- It wasn't easy for me to come here.

668
00:55:44,217 --> 00:55:45,252
Why?

669
00:55:46,009 --> 00:55:49,399
Look, Mrs Ramírez,
Will and I were married an hour ago.

670
00:55:49,675 --> 00:55:51,711
We were all packed and ready to leave,

671
00:55:51,926 --> 00:55:54,315
and then this thing happened
and he wouldn't go.

672
00:55:54,550 --> 00:55:58,702
I did everything. I pleaded, I threatened,
I just couldn't reach him.

673
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:03,673
- And now?
- Well, that man downstairs, the clerk,

674
00:56:04,509 --> 00:56:06,545
he said things about you and Will.

675
00:56:07,467 --> 00:56:09,981
I've been trying to understand
why he wouldn't go with me,

676
00:56:10,218 --> 00:56:13,654
and now all I can think of
is that it's got to be because of you.

677
00:56:13,926 --> 00:56:15,439
What do you want from me?

678
00:56:15,635 --> 00:56:18,786
Let him go. He still has a chance.
Let him go.

679
00:56:19,052 --> 00:56:22,362
- I cannot help you.
- Please.

680
00:56:22,634 --> 00:56:24,704
He isn't staying for me.

681
00:56:25,302 --> 00:56:28,180
I haven't spoken to him for a year
until today.

682
00:56:32,010 --> 00:56:36,367
- I am leaving on the same train you are.
- Then what is it? Why is he staying?

683
00:56:37,469 --> 00:56:41,018
If you don't know,
I cannot explain it to you.

684
00:56:43,510 --> 00:56:46,866
Well, thank you, anyway.
You've been very kind.

685
00:56:48,844 --> 00:56:52,723
What kind of woman are you?
How can you leave him like this?

686
00:56:53,218 --> 00:56:56,016
Does the sound of guns
frighten you that much?

687
00:56:56,344 --> 00:56:58,904
No, Mrs Ramírez, I've heard guns.

688
00:56:59,677 --> 00:57:02,191
My father and my brother
were killed by guns.

689
00:57:02,887 --> 00:57:04,002
They were on the right side,

690
00:57:04,177 --> 00:57:06,896
but that didn't help them any
when the shooting started.

691
00:57:07,136 --> 00:57:10,367
My brother was 19. I watched him die.

692
00:57:11,719 --> 00:57:16,474
That's when I became a Quaker.
I don't care who's right or who's wrong.

693
00:57:17,177 --> 00:57:20,294
There's got to be some better way
for people to live.

694
00:57:23,262 --> 00:57:25,492
Will knows how I feel about it.

695
00:57:26,595 --> 00:57:30,144
Just a minute. Are you going
to wait for the train downstairs?

696
00:57:31,052 --> 00:57:33,486
- Yes.
- Why don't you wait here?

697
00:57:50,095 --> 00:57:53,371
Well, I got no use for Kane,
but I'll say this, he's got guts.

698
00:57:53,637 --> 00:57:55,992
You're mighty broad-minded, Joe.

699
00:58:00,346 --> 00:58:02,337
Now, you, Harv,
I always figured you for guts,

700
00:58:02,554 --> 00:58:04,829
but I never gave you any credit
for brains, till now.

701
00:58:05,054 --> 00:58:06,646
What's that mean?

702
00:58:07,512 --> 00:58:11,266
Nothing. Only it takes a smart man
to know when to back away.

703
00:58:14,096 --> 00:58:18,374
If I can't pick my company when I drink
in here, I ain't coming in here anymore.

704
00:58:19,305 --> 00:58:22,377
Okay. All right.

705
00:58:22,638 --> 00:58:25,436
Look at the boy with the tin star.

706
00:58:25,679 --> 00:58:28,147
All right, if that's the way you want it.

707
00:58:31,555 --> 00:58:34,023
All right, boys,
what are you going to have?

708
00:59:52,097 --> 00:59:55,453
Put a saddle on him, Kane.
Go on, saddle him up.

709
00:59:56,139 --> 00:59:57,777
He'll go a long way before he tires.

710
00:59:57,974 --> 00:59:59,726
That's what you were thinking,
wasn't it?

711
00:59:59,932 --> 01:00:01,763
- Kind of.
- You scared?

712
01:00:03,723 --> 01:00:04,872
I guess so.

713
01:00:06,806 --> 01:00:09,161
Sure. It stands to reason.

714
01:00:12,182 --> 01:00:15,015
Come on, let me help you.

715
01:00:20,974 --> 01:00:23,363
Seems like all everybody
and his brother wants

716
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:24,794
is to get me out of town.

717
01:00:24,973 --> 01:00:27,328
Well, nobody wants
to see you get killed.

718
01:00:30,307 --> 01:00:31,422
Hold it. Where are you going?

719
01:00:31,598 --> 01:00:33,031
I don't know. Back to the office, I guess.

720
01:00:33,224 --> 01:00:36,102
Oh, no. You're getting on that horse
and you're getting out.

721
01:00:36,350 --> 01:00:38,022
What's the matter with you?

722
01:00:38,223 --> 01:00:40,783
You were ready to do it yourself.
You said so.

723
01:00:41,307 --> 01:00:42,456
Look, Harv.

724
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:44,870
I thought about it because I was tired.

725
01:00:45,100 --> 01:00:47,375
You think about a lot of things
when you're tired.

726
01:00:47,599 --> 01:00:49,635
- But I can't do it.
- Why?

727
01:00:50,141 --> 01:00:51,574
I don't know.

728
01:00:52,431 --> 01:00:54,023
Get on that horse, Will.

729
01:00:55,849 --> 01:00:58,682
Why is it so important to you?
You don't care if I live or die.

730
01:00:58,932 --> 01:01:00,160
Come on.

731
01:01:00,850 --> 01:01:03,922
Don't shove me, Harv.
I'm tired of being shoved.

732
01:02:48,309 --> 01:02:51,301
I hate this town. I always hated it.

733
01:02:52,851 --> 01:02:55,843
To be a Mexican woman
in a town like this.

734
01:02:56,394 --> 01:02:57,543
I understand.

735
01:02:59,644 --> 01:03:01,635
You do? That's good.

736
01:03:01,852 --> 01:03:05,401
I don't understand you.
No matter what you say.

737
01:03:05,893 --> 01:03:08,612
If Kane was my man,
I'd never leave him like this.

738
01:03:08,853 --> 01:03:10,730
I'd get a gun. I'd fight.

739
01:03:10,935 --> 01:03:12,050
Why don't you?

740
01:03:14,060 --> 01:03:16,654
He is not my man. He's yours.

741
01:03:36,311 --> 01:03:38,825
You got some clean water I can use?

742
01:03:39,060 --> 01:03:42,416
Why, sure, Marshal. Sure, sure.
Sit down.

743
01:03:49,811 --> 01:03:51,927
Run into some kind of trouble, Marshal?

744
01:03:52,145 --> 01:03:53,737
No, no trouble.

745
01:03:58,270 --> 01:04:01,501
- What are you building?
- Oh, just fixing things up out back.

746
01:04:01,769 --> 01:04:04,761
Now take it easy, Mr Kane.
Just settle back. That's it.

747
01:04:08,146 --> 01:04:10,455
- Fred, Fred, hold it a while, will you?
- Hold it?

748
01:04:10,687 --> 01:04:12,279
You just stop till I tell you to start again.

749
01:04:31,437 --> 01:04:33,587
- Thanks.
- You're welcome, Marshal.

750
01:04:34,062 --> 01:04:35,211
No charge...

751
01:04:35,397 --> 01:04:38,116
You can tell your man
he can go back to work now.

752
01:05:03,313 --> 01:05:04,268
Will!

753
01:05:04,437 --> 01:05:07,827
I guess I forgot about you, Herb.
I'm sure glad you're here.

754
01:05:08,105 --> 01:05:09,936
I couldn't figure out
what was keeping you.

755
01:05:10,146 --> 01:05:12,455
- Time's getting pretty short.
- Sure is.

756
01:05:12,689 --> 01:05:15,840
When are the other boys gonna
get here? We got to make plans.

757
01:05:16,103 --> 01:05:18,697
The other boys?
There aren't any other boys, Herb.

758
01:05:18,938 --> 01:05:21,213
- It's just you and me.
- You're joking.

759
01:05:21,855 --> 01:05:23,811
No, I couldn't get anybody.

760
01:05:24,814 --> 01:05:27,726
I don't believe it.
This town ain't that low.

761
01:05:28,062 --> 01:05:29,780
I couldn't get anybody.

762
01:05:30,396 --> 01:05:32,956
- Then it's just you and me.
- I guess so.

763
01:05:33,188 --> 01:05:36,021
You and me against Miller
and all the rest of them?

764
01:05:36,980 --> 01:05:39,494
That's right. Do you want out, Herb?

765
01:05:39,939 --> 01:05:43,773
Well, it isn't that I want out, no.

766
01:05:44,647 --> 01:05:46,763
You see... Look, I'll tell you the truth.

767
01:05:46,980 --> 01:05:50,256
- I didn't figure on anything like this, Will.
- Neither did I.

768
01:05:50,523 --> 01:05:51,956
I volunteered. You know I did.

769
01:05:52,147 --> 01:05:53,865
You didn't have to come to me.
I was ready.

770
01:05:54,064 --> 01:05:57,181
Sure, I'm ready now.
But this is different, Will.

771
01:05:57,439 --> 01:05:59,236
This ain't like
what you said it was gonna be.

772
01:05:59,439 --> 01:06:01,714
This is just plain committing suicide.
And for what?

773
01:06:01,939 --> 01:06:04,214
Why me? I'm no lawman.
I just live here.

774
01:06:04,439 --> 01:06:07,795
I got nothing personal against nobody.
I got no stake in this.

775
01:06:08,856 --> 01:06:10,289
I guess not.

776
01:06:11,105 --> 01:06:12,982
There's a limit
how much you can ask a man.

777
01:06:13,189 --> 01:06:15,578
I got a wife and kids.
What about my kids?

778
01:06:16,774 --> 01:06:18,651
Go on home to your kids, Herb.

779
01:06:23,815 --> 01:06:26,852
You get some of the other fellows, Will,
and I'll still go through with it.

780
01:06:27,106 --> 01:06:28,824
Go on home, Herb.

781
01:06:55,483 --> 01:06:57,075
What do you want?

782
01:06:57,274 --> 01:06:59,230
I found them, Marshal,
like you wanted me to.

783
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:02,910
- All but Mr Henderson.
- I found him. Thanks.

784
01:07:03,190 --> 01:07:04,623
You're welcome.

785
01:07:05,983 --> 01:07:09,817
Marshal, listen. Let me fight with you.
I ain't afraid.

786
01:07:10,982 --> 01:07:13,542
- No.
- Please let me, Marshal.

787
01:07:14,649 --> 01:07:16,446
You're a kid. You're a baby.

788
01:07:16,733 --> 01:07:19,725
I'm 16. And I can handle a gun, too.
You ought to see me.

789
01:07:20,192 --> 01:07:22,308
You're 14.
And what do you want to lie for?

790
01:07:22,524 --> 01:07:25,561
Well, I'm big for my age.
Please, Marshal.

791
01:07:25,816 --> 01:07:28,250
Well, you're big for your age all right,
but, no.

792
01:07:28,483 --> 01:07:30,758
Go on. Get out of here. Go on.

793
01:10:40,030 --> 01:10:42,669
Hey, Charlie, you can go home now.

794
01:10:45,237 --> 01:10:46,465
Thanks, Marshal.

795
01:10:49,653 --> 01:10:52,725
I sure appreciate it. I certainly do.

796
01:10:59,445 --> 01:11:02,039
You don't happen to know
if the saloon's open, do you, Will?

797
01:11:02,279 --> 01:11:04,554
- I said go home, Charlie.
- Yes, sir.

798
01:11:11,237 --> 01:11:13,512
- So long, Helen.
- Goodbye, Sam.

799
01:11:13,738 --> 01:11:14,853
Take care.

800
01:12:50,156 --> 01:12:52,875
- Hello, Frank.
- How are you, Frank?

801
01:12:53,323 --> 01:12:55,553
- Everything ready?
- Sure. Just the way you want it, Frank.

802
01:12:55,781 --> 01:12:59,410
- Yeah, we got your gun over here.
- Let's get started, then.

803
01:15:24,077 --> 01:15:26,716
- Can't you wait?
- Just want to be ready.

804
01:16:19,160 --> 01:16:20,513
Miller.

805
01:19:59,790 --> 01:20:00,939
Go!

806
01:22:50,253 --> 01:22:52,084
All right, Kane. Come on out.

807
01:22:52,337 --> 01:22:55,647
Come out, or your friend here
will get it the way Pierce did.

808
01:22:57,960 --> 01:22:59,951
I'll come out. Let her go.

809
01:23:00,169 --> 01:23:02,409
As soon as you walk through that door.
Come on. I'll hold my fire.

810
01:23:48,160 --> 01:23:51,835
# Do not forsake me, oh my darlin'

811
01:23:53,680 --> 01:23:57,878
# You made that promise when we wed

812
01:23:59,840 --> 01:24:03,753
# Do not forsake me, oh my darlin'

813
01:24:05,880 --> 01:24:11,716
# Although you''re grievin',
I can't be leavin'

814
01:24:11,920 --> 01:24:16,630
# Until I shoot Frank Miller dead

815
01:24:18,640 --> 01:24:24,272
# Wait along, wait along
