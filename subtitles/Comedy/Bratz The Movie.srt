1
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,960 
- Okay, chicas. Ready?
- Let's do it.

2
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,880 
- Okay, on three.
- One.

3
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:16,920 
- Two.
- Three.

4
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:28,520 
First day has arrived.
Ready to be ready?

5
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,160 
Oh, man!

6
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,080 
The skirt I bought
is at my mom's house.

7
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,680 
I thought you were
at your mom's house.

8
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,920 
No, it's Monday.
I'm at my dad's house.

9
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,720 
Joint custody.
What can I say?

10
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,160 
Has anyone seen my turquoise shirt?

11
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,080 
You left it here by mistake.

12
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,040 
Do you mind if I wear?

13
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,880 
- Oh, of course.
- Okay.

14
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,360 
Turquoise thermal, tank,

15
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,920 
and... stripey warmers.

16
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:50,760 
Super cute.

17
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,760 
Killer plunge... shorties,

18
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:56,040 
and leopard kicks.

19
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,960 
Plaid skirt, lame sweater.

20
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:58,920 
Jade.

21
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,840 
What?
You know my parents.

22
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,560 
Just till I get out of the house.

23
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,520 
And then?

24
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,720 
And then I'm gonna blow all y'all away.

25
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,280 
I guess none of you wanna
know what I'm wearing.

26
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,480 
Shoes to die for.

27
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,160 
Lucky guess. Okay.

28
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,640 
40 minutes, front entrance,
we walk in together.

29
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,280 
- Adios.
- Sayonara.

30
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,600 
- Do svidaniya.
- Ciao, my sisters.

31
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,120 
Manny, jandalel

32
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,920 
jEs el primero día de la escuelal

33
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,520 
You have ten seconds to get
out of there, you little toad.

34
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,640 
Don't get your bragas in a twist.

35
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:45,320 
Perfection takes time,
and I'm worth every single second.

36
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,560 
Enough with the hair already.

37
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,480 
Looking good, chica.

38
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,720 
Yasmin, you will pay for this.

39
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,760 
Bubbie, Bubbie!

40
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,000 
You were waiting for me?

41
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,200 
Come on, ni?os. Get dressed.

42
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,200 
You don't wanna be late.

43
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,400 
Go comb your hair.

44
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,560 
And you, you come with me.
I got something for you.

45
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,680 
Buenos diasl

46
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,680 
Oh, hey.

47
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,040 
I want you to go get dressed
and put these on.

48
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,200 
Bubbie!

49
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,440 
I know.

50
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,360 
So, come on. Pay up.

51
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:33,080 
Chocolate. How do you do that?

52
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,880 
I'm not telling.

53
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:38,280 
Nice doing business with you.

54
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,760 
Come on!

55
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,600 
- Dad.
- What?

56
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,320 
What would I do without you?

57
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,600 
It's probably your mom.

58
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,920 
I'll get it.

59
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,320 
Tell her that she's gotta take you
to the dentist on Thursday.

60
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,680 
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi.

61
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,360 
Did your dad give you breakfast?

62
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,440 
I'll be ready in a minute, 'kay?

63
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,480 
Okay, beautiful.

64
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,320 
Oh, hey, honey,
could you tell your dad

65
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,800 
he needs to take you
to the dentist on Thursday?

66
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,640 
Why can't the two of you
just talk to each other?

67
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,080 
I'm the kid.

68
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,600 
You're supposed to be the adults.

69
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,520 
By the way, the dentist is on Friday.

70
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,880 
Bye, Mom. Bye, Dad.

71
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,200 
Jade! Jade!

72
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:55,000 
Let me look at you before you go.

73
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,400 
Now, remember, Jade,
you have Mathletes,

74
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:00,000 
science club, room one, and violin.

75
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,720 
Mom, you forgot something.

76
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,960 
- I did?
- School!

77
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,600 
And speaking of which, I gotta go.

78
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,320 
Papa. Papa.
Take a picture.

79
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,840 
Hey, what's up, ladies?

80
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,240 
Mom.

81
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,440 
Perfect. Have fun.

82
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,680 
Bye.

83
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,360 
C-A-double-R-Y!

84
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,600 
Where's Cloe?

85
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,360 
She's here.

86
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,520 
- Hi, guys.
- Hey, girl.

87
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,640 
Okay, it's a big school.
It's the first day.

88
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,800 
We're just freshmen.

89
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,920 
What are we gonna do?

90
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,160 
Blend?

91
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,160 
- Own it!
- Right.

92
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,920 
BFFs!

93
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:18,160 
Guys. Hello!

94
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,960 
- Re-huddle!
- Yeah.

95
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,920 
I'm gonna own cheerleading.

96
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,520 
I'm gonna try out for soccer.

97
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,720 
Yas, you have to join chorus.

98
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,840 
You know you have the most
insane voice ever.

99
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:33,000 
Not a chance.
Remember kindergarten?

100
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,640 
Me, "Mary Had a Little Lamb,"
throw-up, 30 kids screaming?

101
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,960 
Yeah. I think I'll own journalism instead.

102
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,320 
I'm ownin' the science.

103
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,640 
Okay, work the IQ, girl,

104
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,960 
but please don't lose
your passion for fashion.

105
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,960 
Just to keep Mom and Dad off my back.

106
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,400 
I'm also gonna rule home ec.

107
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,320 
I'm gonna need
sewing machines for projects.

108
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,160 
I'm gonna have the hottest clothes ever.

109
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,400 
Break.

110
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,120 
Wow.

111
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,640 
Okay, girls.
Now let's do it.

112
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,680 
Now, being president of the school
is a huge responsibility.

113
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,400 
And it is one that I take very seriously.

114
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,200 
Just sit here, Paris.

115
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,600 
Hello.

116
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,840 
Dylan, dude, that was a totally...

117
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,560 
Avery, Quinn, please pay attention.

118
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:39,960 
I need to become very familiar
with the clique lunch table assignment chart.

119
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:44,160 
Because, as you can see,
there are 48 distinct cliques.

120
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,800 
Let me break this down for you.

121
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:50,320 
You have the goths, the skaters,
the disco dorks, the beat boy blingers,

122
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:53,280 
the gangstas, the wanna-be gangstas,
the pretzel people who are into yoga,

123
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:57,600 
very different from the greenies
who hate anything not made of plants.

124
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:01,040 
Then you have the nerds,
the kids who like to dress like dinosaurs,

125
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,560 
and the football jocks.

126
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:06,120 
Oh, hi, little freshman.
I'm Meredith.

127
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,800 
- So... any clubs?
- Nope.

128
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,600 
- Interests?
- Nope.

129
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,440 
- Friends?
- Nope.

130
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,760 
Okay.

131
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,560 
- Loner.
- Yeah.

132
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,560 
- Over there.
- I don't get the Ioners.

133
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:22,160 
They're Ioners, but they like
to hang out together.

134
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,640 
Leave me alone.

135
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,560 
Whatever. Next?

136
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:29,440 
I really believe very strongly
in renewable energy.

137
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,880 
Eco-maniac.

138
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:33,680 
Very good, Cameron.
Tree hugger.

139
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,720 
Now, if you sit at this table,
you'll find some people

140
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:39,520 
who totally rock
the "paper versus plastic" debate.

141
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,760 
Next!

142
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,560 
Good morning, Principal Dimly.

143
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,360 
Oh, good morning, students.

144
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,480 
Pumpkin pie?

145
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,200 
- Good morning Principal Dimly.
- Good morning Principal Dimly.

146
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,920 
Yes, Daddy, what is it?

147
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,760 
You were right.

148
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,840 
Chapter 10.

149
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,800 
"Control the population.

150
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,080 
A: Separate the inmates into groups."

151
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,400 
You see, this was your idea.

152
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,440 
Advanced thinking. Genius.

153
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,480 
Okay. Daddy?

154
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,600 
I've told you this more than 50 times.

155
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,880 
You may not speak to me
during school hours.

156
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,480 
Well, dear, everyone knows
you're my daughter,

157
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,440 
and I'm very proud of you.

158
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:19,400 
Do you want me to tell Mother about this?

159
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,480 
Oh, no.

160
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,800 
Well, I'm busy now, Daddy.

161
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,360 
Bye.

162
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,880 
I'll see you at home, then, candy cane.

163
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,760 
Next.

164
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:33,600 
Okay, honey, this is a really nice table,

165
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,400 
and I promise it will
always be the same table

166
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,280 
because I understand that
change is really upsetting.

167
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,360 
Oh, no!

168
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,480 
They did not just walk past us
without checking in.

169
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,080 
Who is that?

170
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,680 
No one you even need
to think about, Cameron.

171
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,920 
They look kind of cool.

172
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:15,240 
Yeah, in a totally trashy,
beneath our contempt,

173
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,680 
maybe we could find a little spare time
to crush them into the dirt sort of way.

174
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,920 
- Yeah.
- No, Avery, we don't crush.

175
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,720 
We focus on the positive
here at Carry Nation High.

176
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,640 
We help them find their way.

177
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,320 
Or else.

178
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,000 
Yeah!

179
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,880 
You try beating Carry Nation High

180
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:50,920 
Is it just me, or does this all look
a little creepily well organized?

181
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,680 
See you at lunch!

182
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,920 
See ya later.

183
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,640 
Excuse me, miss.

184
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,520 
Are you in the right room?

185
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,320 
Yeah.

186
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:11,040 
A little magnesium,
some sodium chloride,

187
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,880 
a pinch of perchlorate,
a soupcon of strontium nitrate,

188
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,200 
and a little bling.

189
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,200 
And...

190
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,280 
A Bernoulli effect.

191
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,200 
You are seriously superior.

192
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,680 
We would be honored to have you
as a member of our science team.

193
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,800 
Yeah, thanks for the accolades.

194
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,400 
Everybody, go

195
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,640 
Let's go, Falcons

196
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,360 
Let's go, Falcons

197
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,400 
Last time!

198
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,560 
Everybody, go

199
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,920 
Let's go, Falcons

200
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,600 
Let's go, Falcons

201
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:55,360 
Now, that's the level I expect
from a Falcon cheerleader.

202
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,960 
- Who's got it?
- Please.

203
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,400 
You've got something better?

204
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:01,280 
- Oh, you know I do.
- So bring it.

205
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,600 
Girl, I brought it, nailed it,
lent it to my friend's kid sister,

206
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,760 
and I brought it back while
you were still figuring out the beat.

207
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,800 
Yeah!

208
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,240 
What are you gawking at?

209
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,600 
She's hot.

210
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,080 
Hot player. Seriously.

211
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,320 
Not bad for a rookie.

212
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,120 
In fact, not bad at all.

213
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,760 
Yes!

214
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,640 
It's very red.

215
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,800 
It's very you.

216
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,840 
You in?

217
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,800 
Why don't you watch where you're going?

218
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,840 
Are you blind?

219
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,120 
Hello?

220
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,960 
No, but I'm deaf.

221
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,120 
What?

222
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,960 
I'm deaf.

223
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,720 
You don't sound deaf.

224
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,560 
Well, you don't look ignorant,
but I guess you can't judge a book, right?

225
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:39,360 
Where do they think they're gonna sit?

226
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,720 
Give me the seating charts.

227
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,920 
Hi, guys. I'm Meredith,
student body president.

228
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,680 
I saw you looking kind of lost,
so I thought I'd come over and help.

229
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,720 
Thanks, but I think we're good.

230
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,760 
It's no problem.
I have the seating charts right here.

231
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:58,640 
Well, thanks, but I think
we'd rather sit together.

232
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:01,720 
But there's really not a table for that.

233
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,840 
That's okay, I'm sure
we'll find space somewhere.

234
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,960 
But the lunch courtyard
isn't organized that way.

235
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,440 
Oh, don't worry.
We'll figure something out.

236
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:12,160 
- What was that about?
- 'Kay.

237
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,920 
What are you looking at?

238
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:23,800 
They're just awesome...

239
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:26,200 
ful.

240
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,520 
Awful.

241
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,360 
Their clothes? Yuck.

242
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,160 
Really super awful.

243
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,280 
To look at.

244
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,320 
Really.

245
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,760 
Yeah, I know.

246
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,320 
What are we gonna
do about them, you guys?

247
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:40,080 
I'll tell you what we're gonna do.
Nothing.

248
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,760 
Quinn, my system is flawless.

249
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,320 
Hey. Hey, Jade.

250
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,360 
Look.

251
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,000 
Come here.
Check out this radical theorem.

252
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,440 
You'll absolutely dig it.

253
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,680 
- Later!
- Bye.

254
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,640 
Hey, Sasha, come sit with us.

255
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,600 
I gotta go.

256
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,160 
- Bye, guys.
- Bye, Sasha.

257
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,160 
Yo, Cloe.
Girl, come check this out.

258
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,800 
Oh, my God.

259
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,040 
Oh, sure.

260
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:13,480 
You see?

261
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,960 
We have no problems at all.

262
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:21,320 
Jade, I'm stuck babysitting.
Come over and hang.

263
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:24,000 
Papi made your favorite.
Matzo albondigas.

264
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,040 
I have Mathletes.
Next week?

265
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:28,600 
- I'm booked solid. Yikes.
- Next week?

266
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,680 
I have journalism.

267
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,400 
- How about tomorrow?
- We have to make time for each other.

268
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,520 
- Wanna come over and study?
- Let's do it next week for sure.

269
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,640 
You said that the last time.

270
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,200 
- Where are you?
- I seriously miss you guys.

271
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,720 
What's happening here?

272
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:38,960 
You're always busy!

273
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,680 
Fine!

274
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,760 
- Hey, Sasha.
- Yasmin, hey, girl.

275
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,040 
Long time, no see.
What are you doing here?

276
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:59,000 
We were supposed to go
shopping together, remember?

277
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,160 
Go, Falcons!

278
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,800 
No worries.

279
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,520 
My bad, Yas.
I'm sorry.

280
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,080 
I've got practice with the girls.

281
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,520 
Can we do it next week?

282
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,320 
Oh, sure.

283
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,040 
Yas, you're the best.

284
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,920 
We'll do it next week, okay?
For sure. I'll call you.

285
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,760 
- Okay. Call me.
- Bye.

286
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,480 
You ruined my hair!

287
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,120 
Hey, you can take the bus.

288
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,920 
Yo, listen up.
That bus is weak.

289
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,360 
It's cramped up with freaks.

290
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,040 
And I have no time
to show my hair mystique.

291
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,600 
Word.

292
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,720 
Weird.

293
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,480 
- Hi, Ali!
- Bethany!

294
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,560 
Hey, Dexter!

295
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,080 
Hey, what's up, ladies?

296
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,640 
All right, we can sit down now.

297
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,360 
Let's sit down.

298
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:09,440 
Well, well, well, welcome back
to another wonderful year

299
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,960 
at Carry Nation High School.

300
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:14,240 
And now, without further ado,
I'm going to introduce to you

301
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,040 
your very popular President
of the Student Body,

302
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,080 
my little pollywog, my daughter,

303
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,120 
Meredith Baxter Dimly.

304
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,320 
Good morning.

305
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:31,800 
I am so thrilled to be here
as your student body president

306
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,040 
once again.

307
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:42,040 
I am here to talk about the talent show,
which I will be heading up again.

308
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:45,400 
And the fact that besides
the coveted Golden Hatchet,

309
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:49,440 
our wonderful arts committee is providing
a spectacular grand prize this semester:

310
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:54,440 
A college scholarship
to the school of your choice!

311
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,680 
Isn't that amazing?

312
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,960 
So you can post
your auditions on MySpace...

313
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,720 
Hey.

314
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,360 
Hi.

315
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,840 
Oh, good gloss.
Peach party?

316
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,760 
Yeah! I just got it!
You like it?

317
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,800 
- I love it.
- I know.

318
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,200 
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

319
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,720 
Great lip gloss.

320
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,760 
Yeah, it's so shiny and...

321
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,360 
- Yes, very.
- Yeah.

322
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,920 
Shiny.

323
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,440 
Yeah, so...

324
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,160 
I actually have to get to class.

325
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,600 
Oh, yeah, of course.
Well...

326
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,520 
Have a good class.

327
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,360 
- Thanks.
- Yeah. Okey-dokey.

328
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,760 
- Back at ya.
- See ya.

329
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,200 
I miss you.

330
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:14,040 
Wow, Meredith,
starting a new trend at school?

331
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:16,720 
House frump chic.
It suits you.

332
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:20,360 
Seriously, Cherish, I told you,
you may not speak to me before noon.

333
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,760 
Is that so I don't have
to smell your morning breath?

334
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,680 
Or is that the dogs?

335
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:28,200 
Did you make your appointment
with Extreme Face Makeover yet?

336
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,280 
Voila.

337
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:37,240 
Now, you are Fido-fabulous.

338
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:41,640 
Now we are both true fashion icons,
aren't we, Paris?

339
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,360 
Yeah, fetching.

340
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,640 
Get it? Dog?

341
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,680 
Fetching?

342
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,120 
A dog fetches?

343
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:53,440 
These are the jokes, people!

344
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,040 
Dylan, you've been holding out on me.

345
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,960 
All this time, I thought
you were just some cool jock.

346
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,760 
Dylan, Dylan, Dylan.
What's up?

347
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,000 
Nothing.

348
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,840 
I miss it.

349
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,000 
I miss music.

350
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,640 
I feel you, but you don't have to.

351
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,840 
What are you talking about?
I can't hear.

352
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,360 
Come here.

353
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,400 
Feel that?

354
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,840 
Yeah, but...

355
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,360 
it doesn't mean that I can play it.

356
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:01,240 
True. Come here.

357
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,000 
Try it.

358
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,120 
Know something, Whitman?

359
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,640 
You're a weird dude.

360
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,480 
But you're okay.
You know that?

361
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,000 
Wanna learn a few tricks?

362
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:36,640 
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

363
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:46,400 
I can feel that on my neck.

364
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,720 
So what're you gonna do
for the talent show this year, Meredith?

365
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:53,120 
It doesn't matter.
You know she's gonna win.

366
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,480 
Just because I'm going to win

367
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,960 
doesn't mean that
I don't owe all of my fans

368
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,320 
a really cool show.

369
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,440 
That's true.

370
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,480 
Hey. What do you think?

371
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,520 
Juggling? Please.

372
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,400 
That is so not talent show ready.

373
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,520 
Hi.

374
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,880 
Who, me?

375
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,000 
Yeah.

376
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:34,560 
Okay, Paris, we're a team,
and Mommy needs your help.

377
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,760 
I need you to go over there.
Yes, I do.

378
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,160 
And I need you to make sure
that Cameron stops talking

379
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,480 
to the evil soccer freak.

380
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:44,240 
Okay? Okay?
Thank you.

381
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:58,520 
Wow. Hi, l...

382
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,840 
- I'm Cloe.
- I'm Cameron.

383
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,560 
Yeah, I know.

384
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:03,720 
What classes are you in?

385
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,240 
Classes?

386
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,120 
Stuff.

387
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,280 
Cloe! You are the biggest klutz ever!

388
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,520 
You always ruin everything...

389
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,680 
Oh, no.

390
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,720 
Cloe!

391
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,920 
Oh, my gosh.
I am so sorry.

392
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:37,680 
Oh! No! You didn't!

393
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,960 
Jade, you totally did that on purpose!

394
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:52,920 
Oh, my gosh!
My hair!

395
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:57,240 
Sasha! You stupid... cheerleader!

396
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,840 
You did not just say that!

397
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,000 
Keep talking!

398
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,840 
Someday you'll say something intelligent.

399
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,480 
You know what?

400
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,600 
You're not as bad as people say you are.

401
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:10,760 
You're worse!

402
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:16,120 
Food fight!

403
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,160 
Yasmin, you...

404
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:24,640 
Cloe, this is all your fault!

405
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,200 
Get down here!

406
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,480 
Take that!
Oh, my gosh!

407
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,160 
No! Jade!

408
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,000 
- Oh, my gosh.
- Here, want some of this?

409
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,360 
Enough already!

410
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,760 
Oh, my gosh!

411
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,640 
Hey, make a hole.
Principal Dimly coming through!

412
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,000 
Move it!

413
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,280 
Principal Dimly's coming through.

414
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,640 
Oh, hi, Daddy.

415
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,160 
Lookie.

416
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:45,680 
I want to know who did this,
or I'm going to...

417
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,600 
I'm going to pass this over
to Vice Principal Sludge.

418
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,160 
Rollo, you take over.

419
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:52,120 
It's the four girls lying next
to the statue. Hello.

420
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:57,200 
You, you, you, and you.

421
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,440 
Detention.

422
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,560 
You started it, clumsy!

423
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:06,040 
I tripped.
Excuse me, Princess Perfect.

424
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,480 
That is so like you!

425
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,080 
You've always been the queen of denial!

426
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,040 
You know what?

427
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,800 
Neither one of you ever thinks
anything through.

428
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,400 
It's always me having
to pick up the pieces.

429
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:16,200 
That's interesting.
We haven't talked in two years.

430
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:18,680 
Ever since you dumped us
to be queen of the dorks!

431
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:19,560 
Me?

432
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:22,600 
You haven't spoken to any of us
since you went all cheerleader.

433
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,480 
I'm not a snob, I'm just better
than you are, yeah!

434
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:27,880 
I didn't stop talking to you,
you stopped talking to me.

435
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,520 
What're you talking about, Sasha?

436
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,920 
At least we don't buy our friends
with our daddy's bank account.

437
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:35,200 
Only because you don't have a dad
or a bank account!

438
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,720 
Stop it!

439
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,760 
All of you, just stop it.

440
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:49,360 
I can't believe
you said that to Cloe.

441
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:51,600 
That's okay.

442
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,520 
No. It's not.

443
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,280 
When your parents got divorced,

444
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:58,960 
Cloe and her mom were
totally there for you.

445
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:00,400 
Don't forget that, Sasha.

446
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:03,480 
Cloe.

447
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,680 
I'm sorry.

448
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:09,320 
Can't believe I said that.

449
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:10,560 
What happened to us?

450
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,200 
- It's okay.
- We were a team.

451
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,840 
We always had each other's backs.

452
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:16,320 
Seriously. Like when you
canceled your ski trip

453
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,680 
to help Cloe study for finals.

454
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:20,920 
That's what friends do.
What about you, Yas?

455
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:23,040 
Remember, you completely
crushed those girls

456
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:26,280 
that used to slam Jade
before she grew into her ears.

457
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:29,480 
Well, she would've done
the same for me. Big deal.

458
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:31,000 
It is a big deal.

459
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:33,200 
Friendship is a big deal.

460
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,720 
Why aren't we friends anymore?

461
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:40,000 
I can't even remember.

462
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:42,400 
It's the cliques.
We're all in them.

463
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:44,440 
That's just how high school works.

464
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,720 
Sasha, you're a cheerleader,
Cloe's a jock,

465
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:50,080 
and Jade, you spend your time between
the science and home ec geeks.

466
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:52,280 
They're not geeks.

467
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,600 
They're really interesting people.

468
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:57,840 
Yeah, but I would never know that
because I'm not in your clique.

469
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,800 
So... what do we do?

470
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,240 
We have to take control

471
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:05,800 
of our lives, of our friendships.

472
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,720 
It's our own fault.

473
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,160 
We can be friends with each other

474
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,880 
and do our own thing, right?

475
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,880 
Okay. How?

476
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:17,320 
We be ourselves,
just like we used to be.

477
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,640 
I miss my girls.

478
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:20,960 
Me, too.

479
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:23,920 
I didn't realize
how much until now.

480
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:29,040 
BFFs?

481
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:32,560 
BFFs!

482
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,920 
- You smell like pasta.
- So do you.

483
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,680 
I can't believe them.

484
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,400 
This is all your fault, Cameron.

485
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:46,000 
Because if you hadn't walked over
and talked to that soccer joke,

486
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,320 
I wouldn't have had to take action.

487
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,080 
And then Daddy's bust
would not have been broken.

488
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:51,160 
And those bimbettes wouldn't be
in detention and back together

489
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:53,560 
creating anarchy in my kingdom.

490
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,400 
Thanks a lot.

491
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:57,880 
Well, if all else fails, I can use this.

492
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,240 
Meredith!

493
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:03,160 
I don't think this, you know,
calls for the jump drive, Meredith.

494
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:05,080 
Maybe everything will be
back to normal by tomorrow.

495
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:07,560 
"Maybe everything will be
back to normal by tomorrow."

496
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:10,560 
Moron.

497
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:13,720 
Let's go.
I can't stand to look at this.

498
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:55,640 
So tell me, chica, why so happy?

499
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,160 
Is there a boy?

500
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:00,040 
Come on, you've been
holding out on me.

501
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,560 
There's no boy, Bubbie.

502
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:03,280 
It's Sasha, Jade, and Cloe.

503
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,440 
We're a team again!

504
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,880 
I mean, everyone at school

505
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,600 
is only friends with
the people in their group,

506
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:10,200 
but we've decided to be
friends with everyone.

507
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,120 
Well, you girls are
doing the right thing.

508
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,240 
You walk into school,

509
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,720 
you socialize with each other,

510
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,160 
with everyone.

511
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:21,440 
You walk in with your
heads held high.

512
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:24,000 
And you walk in

513
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,080 
with these gorgeous new shoes.

514
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:29,400 
JSon divinasl

515
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:32,160 
jHolal
Who's your Bubbie?

516
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:35,800 
JHolal You are!

517
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:39,360 
Bubbie, they're gorgeous!
I love them!

518
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,840 
Ah-ah-ah.
Sweet talk is cheap.

519
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:44,040 
Pay the lettuce.

520
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,840 
Dos chocolatésl

521
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,240 
How do you do that?

522
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,920 
Te amo, Bubbie.

523
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:56,720 
Mmm, I love the smell
of retail in the morning.

524
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,600 
That's my Sasha.

525
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,320 
Gosh, guys.
I missed you so much.

526
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,520 
Two years?
That's, like, forever.

527
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:05,040 
So what's the latest
and greatest?

528
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,400 
Same old, same old,

529
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,600 
I just wish my parents
could see who I really am.

530
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:10,320 
- The worst.
- You know, it's not that bad.

531
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,960 
It just means
I spend a lot of time

532
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:13,600 
changing clothes
in skinny bathrooms.

533
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:16,200 
That's so weird.
Fashion's like your superpower.

534
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,640 
You shouldn't have to hide it.

535
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:20,000 
Please, that's like a textbook
definition of superpower.

536
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:22,040 
It's a thing in your life
that you're really amazing at,

537
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:24,440 
but you hide it from the world
so people will think you're normal.

538
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,480 
And you, Yas?

539
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:26,920 
I started writing some music,

540
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,760 
and yes, it's sounding pretty good.

541
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,280 
And no, you can't hear it.

542
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,280 
- Stage fright?
- Yeah.

543
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,960 
But, Sasha, I mean, it's really
been about missing you guys.

544
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:37,560 
Speaking of guys, whoa.

545
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:40,440 
- Whoo!
- I know, right?

546
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,440 
Yas, look who's walking by

547
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,360 
sporting some bad jeans
and looking fine.

548
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:47,080 
Oh, my gosh.

549
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:48,520 
He totally just checked you out!

550
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,120 
Did you see that? He's into you!

551
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,160 
What, Dylan?
Are you kidding me?

552
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:54,240 
He hates me.

553
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:55,800 
Besides, he is totally not my type.

554
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:58,080 
Oh, you have a type.

555
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,720 
Come on, guys.

556
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,840 
Dylan is not the least bit
interested in me.

557
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,600 
OMG. It's so obvious.

558
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,920 
Okay, you are so wrong.

559
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,360 
He never looks me in the eye,

560
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,600 
he's never asked me out,

561
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:12,080 
and he can never
even remember my name.

562
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,400 
Oh, my God.

563
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,920 
He's crazy about me!

564
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:20,160 
Promise we'll never let anything
break us up ever again.

565
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,400 
Pinky swear.

566
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:25,040 
Pinky swear!

567
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,640 
I love MySpace.

568
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:56,320 
Yeah, that's much.

569
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,840 
Next!

570
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,840 
Hello! I am Magnificent Mike!

571
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:03,400 
Watch as I place my assistant
into the sword box of death.

572
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:04,840 
Prepare to be amazed.

573
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,000 
Great.

574
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,360 
You're in.

575
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,880 
Thank you very much. Next!

576
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,880 
If I see one more violin
playing contortionist,

577
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,080 
I'm going to scream. Next!

578
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:51,080 
I think we're making this too complicated.

579
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:53,760 
I mean, if we wanna be friends,
we should just be friends.

580
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,880 
I totally agree.
I mean, we walk to school.

581
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:58,080 
And we lead by example.
Come on.

582
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:07,560 
Yo, Cloe. Come to us.

583
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:12,640 
Serious?

584
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,840 
Oh, hey, Jade.
Come here. Check this out.

585
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,440 
I'm sorry.

586
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:21,480 
Hey, Sasha!

587
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:22,920 
Come sit with us!

588
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,640 
I can't.

589
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:31,640 
Are people staring?

590
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:33,080 
Oh, yeah.

591
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:01,000 
Super awkward.

592
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,600 
Okay, this is weird.

593
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,800 
I think it's time for plan B.

594
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,240 
Operation Mingle.

595
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:10,840 
Beautiful!

596
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,600 
Wait.

597
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:19,880 
Perfection!

598
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:24,080 
No, straighten your legs.

599
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:27,560 
See, like, don't you have
any fancy pair of sneakers

600
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,000 
in your Yasmin collection?

601
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:30,520 
I mean, anything under 6 inches.

602
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:33,480 
I just want to stay vertical!

603
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,880 
Come on, stay vertical!

604
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,320 
Honey, when I'm through with you,

605
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:40,000 
you will be playing your next
soccer game in stilettos.

606
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,560 
- You serious?
- Trust me.

607
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:43,000 
Hey, Dexter.

608
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,600 
Salutations, Jade.

609
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,240 
Hey, nerd.

610
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,880 
Why is she talking to you?

611
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,600 
Jade? She's my lab partner.

612
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:52,080 
Hey, hottie.

613
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:54,480 
I bet you and I could do
a lab experiment

614
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,400 
without the Bunsen burner.

615
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:57,480 
You feel me?

616
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:58,920 
Ugh.

617
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:03,520 
I think it behooves you to extend
an apology to the lady.

618
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,040 
I don't know what you just said,

619
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:08,400 
but I think you better
mind your own business.

620
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,320 
Oh, you're gonna cry?

621
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:32,960 
Now, would you like to apologize to the lady?

622
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,360 
Sorry, Jade.

623
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,960 
Dude, you ever think
about playing football?

624
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:48,400 
Okay, so, X + Y + Z

625
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,880 
divided by 3 is?

626
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,800 
Okay.

627
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:57,520 
Let's try this.

628
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:00,000 
I think this might make more sense.

629
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:02,400 
Oh, yeah.

630
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:03,720 
What's a touchdown?

631
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,560 
Six!

632
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:07,400 
- Plus an extra point?
- One!

633
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,120 
Plus a safety?

634
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,440 
Two.

635
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,280 
Divided by a field goal?

636
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,520 
Three?

637
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:16,600 
It's good!

638
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:19,280 
Number 1!
Who's number 1?

639
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,440 
Killer rip.

640
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:36,360 
Thanks.

641
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:38,760 
But I think with a little adjustment,

642
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:39,880 
it'd be a whole lot better.

643
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,600 
Power comes from your core.

644
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:46,720 
Like this.

645
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:49,480 
See? All right?

646
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:50,920 
- All right.
- Try one.

647
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:56,400 
You may want to move, just in case.

648
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,920 
I'm good.

649
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,760 
Okay.

650
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:05,040 
Oh, no!

651
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:06,560 
I'm such a klutz!

652
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:09,640 
I'm sorry.

653
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:11,840 
- Are you okay?
- No worries.

654
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:14,120 
Should we try it again?

655
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:32,160 
Oh, my God, Cherish.

656
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,520 
What are you doing?

657
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:36,760 
I'm trying to imagine you
with a personality.

658
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:39,560 
Take me to the happy place.

659
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:42,240 
Take me to the happy place.

660
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,560 
Hurry up.

661
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,880 
Can't you find somewhere
else to be a freak?

662
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:47,400 
So embarrassing.

663
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:48,640 
I'm busy now.

664
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,680 
Can I ignore you some other time?

665
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:51,920 
Didn't you hear, munchkin?

666
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,720 
Everyone does what I tell them to do.

667
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,640 
Not from what I hear.

668
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:58,160 
Ouch.

669
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:59,480 
Oh, whatever, Avery.

670
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,840 
This is just a temporary loss of control.

671
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:08,720 
I can assure you, I will bring order
back to our school.

672
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:11,880 
Now, girls, think.

673
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:15,120 
When was I at the height
of my popularity?

674
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:17,600 
- Last week?
- Last year's talent show?

675
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:19,720 
- I know this one.
- Yes, Quinn?

676
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:21,360 
Your super sweet 16.

677
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:22,720 
She's totally right.

678
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,520 
That was, like, the most
amazing party ever.

679
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,040 
Remember, everyone was,
like, sucking up to you

680
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:28,280 
for weeks before just
to get an invitation.

681
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:29,320 
Well, then, it's settled.

682
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:31,800 
I'm throwing another
super sweet 16 party.

683
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:34,200 
Um, but you're already 16.

684
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:38,920 
I'm throwing
another super sweet 16.

685
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:42,080 
In fact, I'll have MTV
tape the whole thing.

686
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:45,720 
My mom is best friends
with the producers.

687
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,360 
Why is she throwing
another sweet 16?

688
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,560 
I'm not really sure, exactly.

689
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:51,480 
I'm going to use the invitations

690
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:55,040 
to bring organization
and harmony back to our school.

691
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:56,480 
Oh, I get it.

692
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:57,800 
No cliquey, no tickey.

693
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:59,320 
You have a visitor.

694
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,240 
And that'll crush
those snotty girls forever.

695
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:04,240 
And then we'll live happily ever after.
Brilliant!

696
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:07,600 
Yo, Cherish, you left
your shoes at ballet class.

697
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:10,960 
Hey, it's a total chick farm.

698
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:13,640 
Athletic and yet very hot.

699
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:14,600 
Me likey.

700
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:16,880 
Me thinky you're a twerp.

701
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,440 
So what do you think
of my hair today?

702
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:20,360 
I did this side just for you.

703
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:23,400 
Don't you need a license
to be that ugly?

704
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:25,920 
Ooh, I like 'em feisty.

705
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:29,360 
Isn't that Yasmin's little brother?

706
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,840 
Yeah. What's he doing here?

707
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:33,960 
Hey, looking good, mamitas.

708
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:35,960 
Ugh. Okay, that is truly gross.

709
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:37,120 
Oh, my God.

710
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:39,600 
You have the most incredible hair ever.

711
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:40,880 
I know, right?

712
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:42,320 
I'm going out for best hair this year.

713
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:45,480 
No doubt. Anyway...

714
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:48,160 
why don't you come over here
and tell me all about yourself.

715
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:49,400 
Are you kidding me?

716
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:52,760 
Okay. Here, keep this dry.

717
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:05,240 
So, your sister Yasmin.

718
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:07,640 
She is so sweet.

719
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:09,920 
I mean, what's it like
having such a perfect sister?

720
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:12,520 
Yeah, what's it like?

721
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:14,240 
Perfect? Ha ha!

722
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:16,720 
Have you actually met her?

723
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:18,440 
You're so funny.

724
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:20,960 
I mean, she's just so good
at everything, right?

725
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:24,680 
You think so? Check this out.

726
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:27,360 
It's truly fantastic.

727
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:36,120 
Wow.

728
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:38,200 
She is precious.

729
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:41,080 
I just have to have this
for my collection.

730
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:43,400 
Do you think you could
transfer it to this?

731
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:49,440 
Yeah, sure.

732
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:00,560 
Meredith's MTV...
my super sweet 16.

733
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:03,920 
Yeah, it's gonna be totally even more
incredibly awesome than the last one.

734
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,360 
How excited are you?

735
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:07,480 
She already had a sweet 16.

736
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:09,000 
What do you think she's up to?

737
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,160 
Does it matter?

738
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:12,160 
Hello? It's a party.

739
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:13,400 
This can't be good.

740
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:14,560 
Come on.

741
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:19,640 
Oh, my God, how cute is this?

742
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,960 
Darling. Love it.

743
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:24,040 
Apparently so.

744
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:25,680 
Come on, girl. Give it up.

745
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:26,760 
Tell us what's wrong.

746
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:28,480 
I'm not going to Meredith's party.

747
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:31,640 
Okay? I can't afford
to buy anything new.

748
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:33,360 
You guys need to go without me.

749
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:34,320 
I mean it.

750
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:36,720 
Oh, my God, Cloe.
Stop it right now, okay?

751
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:37,960 
The only way
you could embarrass us

752
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:39,200 
is if you don't walk into Meredith's

753
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:41,520 
ridiculously extreme extravaganza.

754
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:43,520 
Yeah, and we've been
pulled apart for too long.

755
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:45,720 
It's not happening again,
not for anything,

756
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:47,360 
and especially not for Meredith.

757
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:51,000 
But, Sasha,
I have nothing to wear.

758
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,640 
You do now.

759
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:54,160 
I have two guilt certificates.

760
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:56,280 
One from my mom
and one from my dad.

761
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:58,680 
And now one for you.

762
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:01,000 
Hey, divorce isn't all that bad.

763
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:03,960 
Now come on, girl, we've got
some serious shopping to do!

764
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:05,000 
Mwah!

765
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:04,840 
Come on!

766
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:06,960 
Aah!

767
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:12,640 
The mall hath no fury
like a shopper scorned.

768
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:13,560 
Yeah.

769
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:14,640 
Good job, girl.

770
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:15,880 
- Thank you.
- I'm proud of you.

771
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:18,760 
Pop your balloons
to see if you're invited

772
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:21,520 
to my MTV
Super Sweet 16 party!

773
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:25,360 
Now, seating will be
organized according to groups,

774
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:27,400 
so if you don't belong to a group,

775
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:29,800 
you really can't come to my party.

776
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:32,480 
So until then, I'll be watching you.

777
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:34,680 
Go ahead, pop 'em!

778
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:43,680 
Oh, my God, this is so fabulous.

779
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:46,560 
I knew it.
It was too good to be true.

780
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:52,120 
I just don't understand
why Meredith is so evil.

781
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:54,440 
I mean, what are we gonna do about her
party?

782
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:56,640 
Nothing, okay? We don't go.

783
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:59,720 
If we can't go to the festival
of Meredith on our own terms,

784
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:01,720 
then trust me, it's not worth it.

785
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:04,320 
Yas, it's gonna be
an amazing party!

786
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:06,240 
Yeah. And, if we don't go,

787
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:09,000 
we can be branded as
total losers and outcasts.

788
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:10,840 
But I'm willing to take the risk.

789
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:12,840 
I'm with Yasmin.
Skip the ego trip.

790
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:14,400 
Yeah, I second that emotion.

791
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:16,680 
- But, guys...
- Sasha, no.

792
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:19,840 
Okay, I hear you.

793
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:22,640 
It's just... there's this
tragic new outfit out there

794
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:24,080 
that's just calling my name.

795
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:27,240 
But... hey, you know?

796
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:29,840 
I'm hanging up and changing my number.

797
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:31,360 
Hold me.

798
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:33,960 
Oh, honey. You'll be just fine.

799
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:35,400 
Come on.

800
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:10,400 
No.

801
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:20,640 
I agree. Absolutely not.

802
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:24,120 
Don't look, Paris.

803
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:27,160 
I'd rather die.

804
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:35,040 
That's the one.

805
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:36,400 
Show me...

806
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:38,200 
I need a little
something right there.

807
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:40,680 
Thank you.

808
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:42,920 
I just love me.

809
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:52,800 
I look so hot.

810
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:54,200 
High five.

811
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:55,640 
Okay, keep going.

812
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:21,760 
Wow. Your singing's amazing.

813
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:24,320 
Oh, my God. Really?

814
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:26,040 
Yeah, like beyond amazing.

815
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:28,080 
Seriously? Thanks.

816
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:30,560 
But I don't understand.

817
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:32,280 
I mean, you can't...

818
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:34,320 
Hear?

819
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:35,560 
It's okay. You can say it.

820
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:38,800 
It's cool. I can't hear, but I heard you.

821
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:41,880 
Okay. I'll bite.

822
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:44,200 
Here. Come here. Let me show you.

823
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:48,120 
Sing something.

824
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:55,320 
Wow! So that's
how you heard me?

825
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:59,640 
Well, I didn't exactly
hear your voice.

826
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:01,920 
I felt your voice.

827
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:03,840 
And it felt amazing.

828
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:04,800 
Awesome.

829
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:06,320 
Yeah, you are.

830
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:07,480 
You have a serious gift.

831
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:09,320 
You did sign up for
the talent show, didn't you?

832
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:10,280 
Because you're definitely winning.

833
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:12,560 
Oh, thanks, but no thanks.

834
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:13,920 
I can't sing in front of people.

835
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,520 
I literally get ill. It's not pretty.

836
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:17,960 
You know what?

837
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:19,960 
I can't hear, but I learned to spin.

838
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,680 
You can do it if you really want to.

839
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:30,040 
Seriously, it'd be a crime
to keep that voice inside yourself.

840
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:34,720 
What's that mean?

841
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:36,080 
Go for it.

842
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:44,040 
Mom? Wow.

843
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:47,080 
This must be a major party.

844
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:49,120 
Mom?

845
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:53,120 
Mom, are you okay?

846
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:54,960 
You're burning up!

847
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:57,760 
Oh, I have to cook the food.
I have to cook the food.

848
00:51:57,840 --> 00:51:59,200 
- No, Mom.
- I have to cook the food.

849
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:00,720 
Mom, you can't work.

850
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:01,880 
You need to sleep.

851
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:04,280 
- Where?
- Mom. Mom.

852
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:05,400 
Mom, look at me!

853
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:09,640 
You need to sleep.

854
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:11,560 
Okay.

855
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:14,320 
A couple hours. You promise
you'll wake me up?

856
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:17,400 
I promise.
Just get some rest.

857
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:19,120 
Please, Mom.

858
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:27,560 
Girl, are you joking?
It's Saturday morning.

859
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:29,120 
- This better be good.
- What's wrong?

860
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:31,680 
It's an emergency.
I need your help.

861
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:32,640 
- I'm there.
- We're there.

862
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:35,720 
So we need to make 150 of each dish.

863
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:38,600 
Cook? You want me to cook?

864
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:41,000 
Girl, I burn water.

865
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,320 
Yeah, are you kidding?

866
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:44,560 
'Cause there's definitely
no way I can do this.

867
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:45,520 
What's this?

868
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:47,040 
Come on, Jade. We can do it.

869
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:48,200 
You're a designer.

870
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:50,600 
Just think of it as...
high fashion for food.

871
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:52,400 
Let's do it.

872
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:20,240 
Cloe, you didn't wake me up.

873
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:22,440 
It's 5:00. I've got so much to...

874
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:27,040 
Who did this?

875
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:28,760 
We did!

876
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:37,680 
This is amazing.

877
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:39,680 
You girls are absolute angels.

878
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:41,800 
Aren't we?

879
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:43,040 
It was a breeze.

880
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:45,440 
What?

881
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:46,800 
Oh, God...

882
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:51,680 
Mom, what's wrong?

883
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:54,760 
My servers can't make it.

884
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:57,520 
This is the biggest party of my career.

885
00:53:57,520 --> 00:54:00,400 
Where am I gonna get
servers in two hours?

886
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:01,760 
We're free.

887
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:03,840 
No, wait. Wait. Wait.

888
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:05,000 
This is Meredith's sweet 16.

889
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:06,720 
Mom, are you kidding?

890
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:09,120 
I couldn't turn it down, honey.
I'm sorry.

891
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:10,960 
No. No. No. It's okay.

892
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:12,120 
I understand.

893
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:13,360 
I'm just gonna cancel it.

894
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:15,280 
We're in.

895
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:17,960 
You sure you want to do it?

896
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:22,560 
What's the worst
that could happen?

897
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:38,080 
Why the sad faces?

898
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:40,760 
Clowns are supposed to be happy.

899
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:43,080 
Be happy.

900
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:50,760 
Perfect.

901
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:56,120 
If you guys want to back out,
I'll totally understand.

902
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:57,760 
All right.

903
00:54:57,840 --> 00:54:59,080 
Everyone's out there
waiting for food,

904
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:01,000 
and gosh darn it,
we're gonna serve it.

905
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:04,080 
I just need five little
minutes and F.E.R.

906
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:07,240 
Girl, I may be wearing
circus clothes and a clown nose,

907
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:09,280 
but I draw a line
at wearing animals.

908
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:11,680 
Uh, no. Not fur.

909
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:13,200 
F-E-R:

910
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:15,320 
My fashion emergency raft.

911
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:18,360 
I never leave home without it.

912
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:21,240 
Well, I got S-M-K:

913
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:23,560 
Sasha's make-up kit.

914
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:26,520 
Holla!

915
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:53,000 
Now that's what I call clown couture.

916
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:06,320 
Giddyup, Jumbo.

917
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:07,880 
Hi, everyone.

918
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:09,680 
Hi, MTV. It's Meredith.

919
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:11,600 
Isn't this amazing?

920
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:13,920 
Hi! Oh, I'm so glad
you could make it

921
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:16,000 
to my super sweet 16 party.

922
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:18,880 
Oh, it's so good to see you.
Hi, everyone.

923
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,320 
I know. So cool, right?

924
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:23,320 
Best party ever already,
and we're just starting.

925
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:28,880 
Fellas, you guys, look.

926
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:31,360 
Oh, yeah!

927
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:33,840 
Oh!

928
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:38,560 
I'm so excited to be here.

929
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:45,160 
Candy, quiche, and pickle puffs!

930
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:50,720 
Thank you so much for coming.

931
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:54,200 
Hello? Me time now.

932
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:57,720 
It's me. On an elephant.

933
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:10,760 
That was amazing.

934
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:12,520 
Get out of my way.

935
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:17,400 
Well, don't you look adorable.

936
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:19,040 
But you're not here to look adorable.

937
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:20,840 
You're here to work.

938
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:22,560 
It's Clover, isn't it?

939
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:24,480 
- Cloe.
- Oopsies.

940
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:26,800 
Anyway, we're all dying of thirst,

941
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:28,040 
so you wanna get us a soda?

942
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:30,160 
I'll take mine with a slice of lime.

943
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:33,600 
Oh, you know, make that
a lemon with a cherry.

944
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:36,760 
But take off the stem
and put in two umbrellas.

945
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:38,600 
One green and, um...

946
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:40,680 
one yellow, 'kay?

947
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:42,440 
Oh, no! Listen, Missy, you...

948
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:43,880 
Sasha.

949
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:47,320 
- Step back.
- Listen...

950
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:48,960 
make sure your friends
keep a cork in it

951
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:51,920 
because I wouldn't want
to have to fire your mother.

952
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,080 
Again.

953
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:58,240 
Okay, what was that about?

954
00:57:58,360 --> 00:57:59,400 
Nothing.

955
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:00,720 
I don't want to talk about it.

956
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:02,280 
Come on, let's work.

957
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:12,920 
Ooh!

958
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,560 
Hi, I'm Meredith's sister.

959
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:17,720 
I've had to put up with
this every day for 11 years.

960
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:20,400 
Can you feel my pain?
Yeah, I'm stuck with her.

961
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:22,040 
You guys look like total rock stars.

962
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:23,360 
I look like a circus freak.

963
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:24,720 
I'll pay you to kidnap me.

964
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:26,520 
I'm worth a lot.

965
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:27,600 
I'll do it.

966
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:29,520 
That nose is workin' for me.

967
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:30,560 
Me likey.

968
00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:00,480 
You're a very beautiful girl, cupcake.

969
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:01,920 
And you look cute
as a button tonight.

970
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:02,880 
Don't let anyone kid ya.

971
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,600 
You're a good dad.

972
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:06,520 
Thank you, uh, jellybean.

973
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:09,320 
May I have your attention, please?

974
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:12,200 
For our first super fun event
of my super evening,

975
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:13,920 
It's time for the entertainment:

976
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,080 
Me!

977
00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:17,280 
Please hold your applause
until the end.

978
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:40,320 
We love you!

979
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:41,560 
Yeah!

980
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:46,280 
Thank you so much.

981
01:00:46,360 --> 01:00:49,320 
And now, for a real treat,

982
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:53,000 
I'd like to invite my dear,
dear friend to go next.

983
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:54,240 
Oh, my God.

984
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:56,240 
I can't believe she's
gonna let me go first.

985
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:57,680 
Yasie, darling.

986
01:00:57,760 --> 01:01:01,240 
A little birdie told me
that you just love to sing.

987
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:08,600 
Come on up here. Come on.

988
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:12,440 
- Come on.
- No. No, please don't.

989
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:13,520 
Don't do this to her.

990
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:14,560 
She has stage fright!

991
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:15,600 
No, stop!

992
01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:22,720 
This is gonna be fantastic.

993
01:01:24,040 --> 01:01:24,920 
Raise the roof, Yasmin!

994
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:32,480 
We love you, Yasmin!

995
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:50,320 
Come on, Yasmin. It's my birthday.

996
01:01:50,320 --> 01:01:52,640 
Show us what you can do.

997
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:08,280 
Oh, dear. She is so adorably shy.

998
01:02:08,360 --> 01:02:10,000 
Precious.

999
01:02:10,080 --> 01:02:13,160 
Well, I have had the privilege
of watching her sing,

1000
01:02:13,240 --> 01:02:14,800 
and I just want you
all to see it.

1001
01:02:33,880 --> 01:02:36,280 
Hey, come on, you guys.
Dance with me.

1002
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:40,120 
Up! Up! Up!

1003
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:41,240 
Come on! Everyone!

1004
01:02:43,480 --> 01:02:45,280 
Stop it!

1005
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:48,640 
Do something about this.

1006
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:49,800 
I'm on it.

1007
01:02:57,160 --> 01:02:58,120 
Stop it!

1008
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:08,200 
And now, for my second change
of the evening.

1009
01:03:08,320 --> 01:03:11,840 
Ladies and gentlemen,
my Aquamarine Meringue.

1010
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:29,800 
Well, is everyone
having a good time?

1011
01:03:31,320 --> 01:03:35,640 
Is this, like, the best
super sweet 16 party ever?

1012
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:38,520 
Do you guys, like,
totally love me?

1013
01:03:39,560 --> 01:03:40,800 
What did she say?

1014
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:42,440 
Let's... Let's start dancing.

1015
01:03:42,560 --> 01:03:43,880 
Okay?

1016
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:49,080 
Hi, MTV.
Welcome to my super sweet 16 party.

1017
01:03:49,160 --> 01:03:51,360 
We love you, MTV!

1018
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:53,560 
My party was totally better than yours.

1019
01:03:58,760 --> 01:04:00,480 
I am so sorry.

1020
01:04:03,080 --> 01:04:05,080 
Foie gras mousse?

1021
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:09,400 
I'm pretty good at lip reading,
not that good.

1022
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:10,840 
You looked great on the big screen.

1023
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:13,120 
Oh, don't remind me.

1024
01:04:13,240 --> 01:04:14,560 
So humiliating.

1025
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:16,480 
Yeah, don't let it get to you.

1026
01:04:16,600 --> 01:04:17,920 
Consider the source.

1027
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:28,680 
Excuse me! Yasmin!

1028
01:04:28,760 --> 01:04:30,480 
Get back to work.
That is not what I'm paying you for.

1029
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:33,080 
No fraternizing with my guests.

1030
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:36,640 
Oh, you have got to be kidding me.

1031
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:38,440 
Shoo! Go! Go!

1032
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,360 
Excuse me!

1033
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:45,760 
Jumbo, come here, boy!

1034
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:47,360 
Go. Go, Jumbo, go.

1035
01:04:48,520 --> 01:04:50,520 
Oh, my gosh.

1036
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:53,520 
Well, if it isn't Cloe the klutzy clown.

1037
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:55,040 
You're fired.

1038
01:04:55,160 --> 01:04:57,440 
Now clean up this disgusting mess
before my guests see it.

1039
01:04:57,440 --> 01:04:59,640 
Cameron, what are you doing?
Get up.

1040
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:02,520 
Cameron!

1041
01:05:02,520 --> 01:05:04,840 
Cameron? Cameron?

1042
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:06,080 
Get me a drink?

1043
01:05:08,680 --> 01:05:10,480 
Get your own drink.

1044
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:13,080 
What? Cameron!

1045
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:18,160 
Thanks a lot, Jumbo.

1046
01:05:32,560 --> 01:05:33,680 
Oh, what are you looking at?

1047
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:37,440 
Stop it! Stop it!

1048
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:40,320 
This is my MTV super sweet 16 party!

1049
01:05:40,320 --> 01:05:43,400 
Everybody go back to your
assigned tables immediately!

1050
01:05:49,720 --> 01:05:51,040 
Thank you.

1051
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:03,320 
Meredith, are you okay?

1052
01:06:03,320 --> 01:06:04,280 
Do you need a hand?

1053
01:06:04,280 --> 01:06:05,640 
I can knit you a towel.

1054
01:06:05,720 --> 01:06:06,800 
I know CPR.

1055
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:09,960 
Look at me!
You guys have ruined everything!

1056
01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:12,720 
There was gonna be
a cake and dancing

1057
01:06:12,840 --> 01:06:14,560 
and an amazing goodie bag.

1058
01:06:14,640 --> 01:06:19,040 
But now the party's over!
You've ruined it for everyone!

1059
01:06:19,160 --> 01:06:20,800 
You... you...

1060
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:22,720 
brats!

1061
01:06:22,800 --> 01:06:24,240 
Hi, MTV.

1062
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:28,840 
This is the best party I have ever
been to in my whole life.

1063
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:31,040 
Happy Birthday, Meredith.

1064
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:38,920 
Well, she's brought back cliques.

1065
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:40,920 
Ok, so, what do we do now?

1066
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:42,280 
Sasha?

1067
01:06:42,280 --> 01:06:43,400 
Hey, Bethany.

1068
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:45,440 
So, we've been talking,

1069
01:06:45,520 --> 01:06:47,560 
and you're a really
great cheerleader,

1070
01:06:47,560 --> 01:06:49,760 
and we really want you
to be a part of the team,

1071
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:52,160 
but if you don't want
to hang out with us,

1072
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:55,520 
then maybe you don't have
the right kind of school spirit for the job.

1073
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:57,600 
So you're saying
if I'm not a part of your clique,

1074
01:06:57,720 --> 01:06:59,320 
I'm off the squad?

1075
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:01,080 
Think about it.

1076
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:06,520 
Hey.

1077
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:09,040 
You either need to spend
more time with us,

1078
01:07:09,040 --> 01:07:11,120 
or we need to cut you
from the roster.

1079
01:07:11,120 --> 01:07:13,720 
Dexter... don't be that guy.

1080
01:07:13,720 --> 01:07:15,560 
I'm afraid that's not up to me.

1081
01:07:17,360 --> 01:07:19,880 
We had a real chemistry, Jade.

1082
01:07:22,360 --> 01:07:23,680 
I'm not doing it.

1083
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:25,440 
Come on, Yas, get over it.

1084
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:28,680 
The only way to get everyone
back together is to win the talent show.

1085
01:07:28,760 --> 01:07:31,000 
Meredith wins every year.

1086
01:07:31,080 --> 01:07:32,920 
You're the only one
that can break her streak.

1087
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,680 
Maybe so, but I'm still not doing it.

1088
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:37,400 
Next subject, please.

1089
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:38,360 
A chicken!

1090
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:42,600 
Fine, that's me.
El pollo Yasmin.

1091
01:07:42,680 --> 01:07:44,320 
Look, if you sing, I'll spin.

1092
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:45,360 
Really?

1093
01:07:45,360 --> 01:07:46,600 
- Yeah.
- No.

1094
01:07:46,600 --> 01:07:49,120 
Come on!
We'll all help you.

1095
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:50,840 
You'll sing, I'll choreograph,

1096
01:07:50,920 --> 01:07:52,480 
Cloe will splash the background
with her video bling,

1097
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:53,440 
and Jade will...

1098
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:54,880 
What, add numbers
faster than anyone?

1099
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:56,120 
2, 147.

1100
01:07:56,200 --> 01:07:57,160 
3,268.

1101
01:07:57,160 --> 01:07:59,080 
5,415. Big whoop.

1102
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:01,960 
Hello, fashion diva.
We're gonna need costumes.

1103
01:08:02,040 --> 01:08:03,000 
Now you're talking, sister.

1104
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:04,280 
And we're gonna need
backup singers, too.

1105
01:08:04,360 --> 01:08:05,880 
- And dancers.
- Why stop there?

1106
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,200 
We should get everyone who
Meredith shot down to perform with us.

1107
01:08:08,280 --> 01:08:09,720 
Perfect! Then you don't need me.

1108
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:11,560 
Ugh. Okay, how about this?

1109
01:08:11,640 --> 01:08:13,480 
The winner gets a scholarship.

1110
01:08:13,560 --> 01:08:16,240 
Know anyone who might need that?

1111
01:08:16,360 --> 01:08:19,320 
Cloe.

1112
01:08:19,400 --> 01:08:21,040 
Okay, fine.

1113
01:08:21,160 --> 01:08:23,640 
But only for Cloe.

1114
01:08:23,640 --> 01:08:24,880 
But I still can't do it.

1115
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:27,360 
- Why?
- Why?

1116
01:08:27,480 --> 01:08:29,880 
Because we don't have a name.

1117
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:34,000 
Well, well, well.
If it isn't the brats?

1118
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:35,520 
Bratz.

1119
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:36,760 
Cloe, you're a genius.

1120
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:38,400 
I am?

1121
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:41,680 
- Bratz!
- Yeah!

1122
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:48,680 
Ready? 5, 6, 7, 8.

1123
01:08:59,800 --> 01:09:01,800 
I love it. Next!

1124
01:09:11,800 --> 01:09:14,160 
I got some great images
that I took of the mime.

1125
01:09:20,320 --> 01:09:22,120 
You're awesome.

1126
01:09:26,280 --> 01:09:27,120 
That looks good.

1127
01:09:38,360 --> 01:09:40,640 
- You're in.
- 5, 6, 7, 8...

1128
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:42,560 
Stop! You're killing us.

1129
01:09:42,680 --> 01:09:44,280 
Alabama, Alaska, Arizona,
Arkansas, California.

1130
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:45,640 
Boring.

1131
01:09:49,480 --> 01:09:50,320 
Horrible.

1132
01:09:50,440 --> 01:09:52,040 
Horrible. You're in.

1133
01:09:55,240 --> 01:09:56,360 
Next!

1134
01:09:56,480 --> 01:09:58,400 
I am Plunger Man!

1135
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:02,240 
Come on, now.
Get up.

1136
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:22,840 
- Hey, sweetheart.
- Hi, Dad.

1137
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:25,160 
Aren't you supposed
to be at Mom's tonight?

1138
01:10:25,240 --> 01:10:28,320 
Oh, Dad, I'm so exhausted,
I completely forgot.

1139
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:30,600 
You know what? You go on to bed.
I'll call Mom.

1140
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:31,960 
And I just wanna
tell you something.

1141
01:10:32,040 --> 01:10:33,400 
I'm really proud of you.

1142
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:35,400 
- You are?
- Yeah.

1143
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:38,080 
You and your friends have put aside
all your differences

1144
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:39,240 
and made it work.

1145
01:10:41,080 --> 01:10:42,880 
Thanks, Dad.

1146
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,080 
Maybe one day you and Mom
will do the same thing.

1147
01:10:45,200 --> 01:10:47,680 
Yeah. Maybe.

1148
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:54,000 
Bratz?

1149
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:57,080 
Oh-no. No way.
Nuh-uh. I don't think so.

1150
01:10:57,080 --> 01:10:58,720 
They ruined my super sweet 16.

1151
01:10:58,720 --> 01:11:01,320 
I am not going to put
them in my talent show.

1152
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:05,520 
Hello, Yasmin?

1153
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:09,440 
So, you see, it's really
in your best interests

1154
01:11:09,560 --> 01:11:10,720 
to drop out of the talent show.

1155
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:13,680 
Or I'll be forced to go public

1156
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:15,000 
with all these embarrassing flaws

1157
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:16,560 
that I have right here
on your friends,

1158
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:19,320 
Sasha, Jade,
and particularly Clover.

1159
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:20,480 
Cloe.

1160
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:22,000 
Same thing.

1161
01:11:22,120 --> 01:11:25,080 
I'm pretty sure Cloe wouldn't want
the entire student body

1162
01:11:25,080 --> 01:11:27,200 
to know that when
her mother worked for us,

1163
01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:29,880 
things just disappeared.

1164
01:11:29,960 --> 01:11:32,680 
Poor girl. How terribly pitiful.

1165
01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:34,280 
You are so devious.

1166
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:36,880 
Thank you.

1167
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:39,080 
I mean, I hate to do it,

1168
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:42,360 
but you can certainly see
my predicament, and yours.

1169
01:11:42,440 --> 01:11:43,680 
Can't you?

1170
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:45,800 
How pathetic.

1171
01:11:45,880 --> 01:11:47,640 
I can't believe you.
You spend half your time

1172
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:49,640 
documenting dirt on everyone else?

1173
01:11:49,720 --> 01:11:51,360 
You really need to get a life.

1174
01:11:51,480 --> 01:11:53,840 
Oh, I have one.
And it is fabulous.

1175
01:11:53,960 --> 01:11:56,160 
Save it.

1176
01:11:56,240 --> 01:11:58,000 
Just leave Cloe alone.

1177
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:59,600 
Smart move.

1178
01:12:05,640 --> 01:12:08,240 
5, 6, 7, 8.

1179
01:12:08,240 --> 01:12:09,600 
1, 2, 3, 4,

1180
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:11,200 
5, 6, 7, 8.

1181
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:13,120 
1, 2, 3, 4,

1182
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:14,960 
5, 6, 7, 8.

1183
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:16,760 
Hit 1, 2, 3, 4.

1184
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:18,400 
5, 6, 7,8.

1185
01:12:18,520 --> 01:12:20,600 
1, 2, 3, 4,

1186
01:12:20,720 --> 01:12:22,040 
5, 6, 7, 8.

1187
01:12:22,160 --> 01:12:24,240 
Yas, come here.
You have to see this.

1188
01:12:24,360 --> 01:12:26,160 
We are so tight. Check.
Watch, show her, ready?

1189
01:12:26,160 --> 01:12:28,200 
Wait. Wait. Guys, wait!

1190
01:12:29,640 --> 01:12:32,040 
I need to tell you something.

1191
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:38,160 
I'm dropping out of the talent show.

1192
01:12:38,280 --> 01:12:39,600 
I just can't do it.

1193
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:41,600 
- What?
- What?

1194
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:42,960 
I'm sorry.

1195
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:45,920 
It's just, you guys kind
of pulled me into it.

1196
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:47,640 
And I never really
wanted to do it anyway.

1197
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:49,480 
This is a joke, right?

1198
01:12:49,560 --> 01:12:52,280 
No, it's not.

1199
01:12:52,360 --> 01:12:54,680 
It's just not my thing.
It's kind of stupid.

1200
01:12:54,760 --> 01:12:58,320 
Stupid?

1201
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:00,120 
No, what's stupid is...

1202
01:13:00,240 --> 01:13:03,480 
is that I'm almost getting
kicked off of my soccer team

1203
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:05,800 
and you, you're the one dropping out?

1204
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:09,240 
Whatever. I don't want to talk about it.

1205
01:13:09,240 --> 01:13:10,600 
You don't wanna talk about it?

1206
01:13:10,680 --> 01:13:13,160 
Can we talk about the fact
that my grades have dropped?

1207
01:13:13,280 --> 01:13:14,320 
How selfish can you be?

1208
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:16,720 
What happened to sticking together?

1209
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:20,920 
I guess I'm just not feeling it anymore.

1210
01:13:20,920 --> 01:13:22,360 
Sorry.

1211
01:13:22,480 --> 01:13:24,880 
Right. Okay.

1212
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:27,560 
Well, I guess if you're not feeling it
anymore, then we're not feeling you.

1213
01:13:27,640 --> 01:13:31,960 
You know what? Come on, girls.
We're through here.

1214
01:13:31,960 --> 01:13:33,520 
Oh, and Yasmin?

1215
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:35,040 
Delete my number from
your cell phone, okay?

1216
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:37,640 
Mine, too.

1217
01:13:37,720 --> 01:13:40,880 
Yeah, sounds about right.

1218
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:36,320 
I tried to protect them,

1219
01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:38,440 
but I lost them instead.

1220
01:14:38,520 --> 01:14:40,040 
Ah, cara mia.

1221
01:14:40,160 --> 01:14:42,080 
They're your best friends.

1222
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:44,200 
Tell them the truth.

1223
01:14:44,280 --> 01:14:45,800 
You don't know Meredith.

1224
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:48,800 
Maybe you should let them decide.

1225
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:51,840 
Está bien, mi ni?a.

1226
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:55,040 
Está bien, mi amor.

1227
01:14:55,040 --> 01:14:58,360 
Bubbie te quiere mucho.

1228
01:15:14,120 --> 01:15:16,120 
Okay.

1229
01:15:16,200 --> 01:15:18,600 
Brown. Blue.

1230
01:15:20,520 --> 01:15:22,840 
Blue. Brown.

1231
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:24,360 
Why aren't you girls getting ready?

1232
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:25,600 
Mom, we're not going.

1233
01:15:25,720 --> 01:15:27,920 
Not going? Why?

1234
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:29,920 
Yasmin bailed on us.

1235
01:15:30,040 --> 01:15:31,160 
Yasmin?

1236
01:15:31,280 --> 01:15:32,920 
She just quit the show.

1237
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:34,920 
We thought our friendship was
more important than anything.

1238
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,320 
I mean, after everything
we've been through.

1239
01:15:37,400 --> 01:15:40,400 
We put it all on the line.
I can't believe it.

1240
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:41,920 
Yeah, it doesn't make sense.

1241
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,600 
Maybe something's wrong with her.

1242
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:50,840 
You girls have been friends forever.

1243
01:15:50,920 --> 01:15:53,240 
Don't you think that you
at least owe it to Yasmin

1244
01:15:53,320 --> 01:15:55,840 
to look a little bit deeper?

1245
01:15:55,920 --> 01:15:57,560 
Find out why she did what she did?

1246
01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:18,360 
Sasha, I have something
to tell you guys.

1247
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:20,480 
- Like, face to face.
- Okay.

1248
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:21,720 
Look out your window.

1249
01:16:40,120 --> 01:16:42,720 
Ladies and gentlemen,

1250
01:16:42,720 --> 01:16:46,360 
welcome to a night of magic.

1251
01:16:48,760 --> 01:16:50,280 
Before we begin,

1252
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:53,360 
I'd like to introduce you
to our illustrious celebrity judges

1253
01:16:53,480 --> 01:16:54,720 
who will be voting for me.

1254
01:16:57,280 --> 01:16:58,840 
I'm totally kidding.

1255
01:16:58,920 --> 01:17:02,480 
Ugh. I can't believe
Meredith would stoop so low.

1256
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:03,720 
Wait, did I just say that?

1257
01:17:03,720 --> 01:17:06,400 
We should've known
you were just protecting us.

1258
01:17:06,520 --> 01:17:07,480 
I didn't tell you.

1259
01:17:07,560 --> 01:17:09,480 
Yeah, but we should've known anyway.

1260
01:17:09,480 --> 01:17:12,720 
Yas, we want to do
the talent show with you.

1261
01:17:12,840 --> 01:17:15,320 
But, guys, remember Meredith?

1262
01:17:15,320 --> 01:17:16,480 
Whatever.

1263
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:18,200 
If we let Meredith scare us
into quitting the show,

1264
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:19,640 
then it's all over.

1265
01:17:19,720 --> 01:17:21,760 
She's gonna make our lives
miserable for the rest of the year.

1266
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:23,680 
Yeah, and it doesn't matter if we win.

1267
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:25,120 
We gotta stand up for ourselves.

1268
01:17:25,200 --> 01:17:26,360 
Show some attitude.

1269
01:17:26,440 --> 01:17:27,880 
So let me get this straight.

1270
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,480 
You guys want to
stand up on stage,

1271
01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:31,920 
in front of the whole school

1272
01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:33,440 
and risk everyone laughing at us

1273
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:35,960 
and thinking we're losers
until we graduate?

1274
01:17:38,040 --> 01:17:40,760 
Exercise?
Yeah, I get enough exercise.

1275
01:17:40,840 --> 01:17:43,720 
Just pushing my luck.
Ba-dum-cha!

1276
01:17:45,720 --> 01:17:49,840 
Anyway, what do termites
eat for breakfast?

1277
01:17:49,960 --> 01:17:53,120 
Oak-meal. Get it?

1278
01:17:53,120 --> 01:17:55,520 
Oak-meal?

1279
01:18:04,040 --> 01:18:05,880 
That was just hilarious.

1280
01:18:05,960 --> 01:18:08,280 
Really. Really wonderful.

1281
01:18:08,360 --> 01:18:10,000 
- Thank you, guys.
- It's hilarious.

1282
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:12,600 
Stiff competition.

1283
01:18:12,680 --> 01:18:15,160 
Our next act is simply amazing.

1284
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:44,320 
Ladies and gentlemen,
live from Carry Nation High,

1285
01:18:44,440 --> 01:18:47,400 
Meredith and the Meredettes.

1286
01:18:59,200 --> 01:19:00,640 
# You know it's all about me #

1287
01:19:01,960 --> 01:19:04,840 
# You know it's all about me #

1288
01:19:04,960 --> 01:19:07,720 
# You know it's all about me #

1289
01:19:07,720 --> 01:19:11,080 
# You know it's all about me #

1290
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,960 
# Don't hate me 'cause I got it goin' on #

1291
01:19:35,080 --> 01:19:38,240 
# It's just me, I'm hot, never cold #

1292
01:19:38,240 --> 01:19:41,000 
# I can rock it any way that I choose #

1293
01:19:41,120 --> 01:19:43,960 
# I'm so good, oh, yeah,
I make up all the rules #

1294
01:19:43,960 --> 01:19:47,240 
# I can't help it if I set all the trends #

1295
01:19:47,320 --> 01:19:49,440 
# Everybody wants
to be my best friend #

1296
01:19:49,560 --> 01:19:52,800 
# It's infectious, come on,
don't you be jealous #

1297
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:53,960 
# Just join in this love fest #

1298
01:19:54,040 --> 01:19:57,600 
# You know that it's all about me #

1299
01:19:57,680 --> 01:20:00,280 
# It's all about me #

1300
01:20:00,360 --> 01:20:03,440 
# Oh, yeah, me, myself, and I #

1301
01:20:03,560 --> 01:20:05,280 
# It's all about me #

1302
01:20:07,560 --> 01:20:10,560 
# Ma-ma-ma MySpace,
I have 10 million friends #

1303
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:13,240 
# Text me, BFF till the end #

1304
01:20:13,240 --> 01:20:16,000 
# Page me on your cell
and press "send" #

1305
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,120 
# Diva what? Diva who?
Diva where? #

1306
01:20:18,200 --> 01:20:19,760 
# That's me #

1307
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:22,360 
# Download all my crazy new hooks #

1308
01:20:22,440 --> 01:20:25,320 
# Upload all my video looks #

1309
01:20:25,400 --> 01:20:28,080 
# So buy my ringtone,
fashion line, and cook books #

1310
01:20:28,200 --> 01:20:29,720 
# Diva what? Diva who?
Diva where? #

1311
01:20:29,840 --> 01:20:33,000 
# It's all about me #

1312
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,680 
# It's all about me,
me, me, me, me #

1313
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:39,320 
# Everybody knows it's I #

1314
01:20:39,400 --> 01:20:41,240 
# It's all about me #

1315
01:20:42,760 --> 01:20:43,840 
# Don't blame her #

1316
01:20:43,920 --> 01:20:46,120 
# I'm so beautiful #

1317
01:20:46,120 --> 01:20:48,440 
- # Not her fault #
- # I'm platinum and gold #

1318
01:20:48,520 --> 01:20:49,880 
# She's the queen #

1319
01:20:49,960 --> 01:20:51,400 
# And my reign is supreme #

1320
01:20:51,480 --> 01:20:54,760 
# So follow the leader,
you're all on my team #

1321
01:20:54,840 --> 01:20:57,520 
# I can't help it
if I set all the trends #

1322
01:20:57,640 --> 01:21:00,800 
# Everybody wants
to be my best friend #

1323
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:03,280 
# It's contagious,
and it's so outrageous #

1324
01:21:03,400 --> 01:21:06,560 
# Grandparents, grownups,
and kids of all ages #

1325
01:21:06,640 --> 01:21:09,640 
# You know Madonna
ain't got nothing on me #

1326
01:21:09,720 --> 01:21:12,000 
# Bu-bu-Beyoncé
ain't got nothing on me #

1327
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:15,000 
# Cha-cha-Christina
ain't got nothing on me #

1328
01:21:15,080 --> 01:21:17,000 
# Diva what? Diva who?
Diva where? #

1329
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:18,160 
# That's me #

1330
01:21:18,240 --> 01:21:19,680 
# You know it's all about me #

1331
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:20,920 
# I'm a specialty #

1332
01:21:20,920 --> 01:21:22,680 
# You know it's all about me #

1333
01:21:22,760 --> 01:21:23,920 
# I'm an anomaly #

1334
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:25,440 
# You know it's all about me #

1335
01:21:25,560 --> 01:21:26,680 
# Who else could it be? #

1336
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:28,720 
# Upload, download,
text me, page me #

1337
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:30,160 
# MySpace, YouTube,
don't erase me #

1338
01:21:30,160 --> 01:21:31,600 
# Indoor, outdoor,
I'm so clever #

1339
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:32,840 
# That's why I will rule forever #

1340
01:21:32,840 --> 01:21:34,000 
# Me #

1341
01:21:39,240 --> 01:21:40,600 
Get off my stage. Go!

1342
01:21:42,600 --> 01:21:43,840 
Wasn't that awesome?

1343
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:48,000 
Ladies and gentlemen,
without further ado,

1344
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:49,720 
let's see who you have chosen

1345
01:21:49,800 --> 01:21:51,160 
as this year's
most talented student

1346
01:21:51,240 --> 01:21:52,760 
at Carry Nation High.

1347
01:21:52,880 --> 01:21:54,680 
Judges, the envelope, please.

1348
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:56,240 
Wait a minute.

1349
01:21:56,240 --> 01:21:57,760 
There's still one more act.

1350
01:21:57,880 --> 01:21:59,760 
No, the show is over,

1351
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:00,720 
with a capital over.

1352
01:22:00,840 --> 01:22:02,280 
Hey, listen, the girls signed up,

1353
01:22:02,360 --> 01:22:04,080 
they deserve the right to perform.

1354
01:22:04,200 --> 01:22:06,200 
- He's right.
- Oh, please.

1355
01:22:06,320 --> 01:22:07,920 
I know the rules, but thanks anyway.

1356
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:09,960 
Hey, those are my parents
you're talking to.

1357
01:22:10,040 --> 01:22:12,160 
You will not disrespect them like that.

1358
01:22:12,240 --> 01:22:13,600 
Have you considered anger management?

1359
01:22:13,680 --> 01:22:16,000 
Oh, Meredith. Bag it.

1360
01:22:16,080 --> 01:22:18,560 
- Introduce us, Cloe.
- Wait!

1361
01:22:18,560 --> 01:22:21,560 
Are you sure you want to do
this to your friends, Yasmin?

1362
01:22:26,520 --> 01:22:28,640 
Well, then, it is my responsibility,

1363
01:22:28,760 --> 01:22:29,880 
as your student body president,

1364
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,760 
to let you know
who these brats really are.

1365
01:22:42,080 --> 01:22:45,240 
Exhibit A, the fashionista.

1366
01:22:45,320 --> 01:22:47,160 
I say Imposturista.

1367
01:22:47,160 --> 01:22:50,520 
She lies to her parents,
to her teachers,

1368
01:22:50,520 --> 01:22:51,960 
and to you.

1369
01:22:52,040 --> 01:22:54,360 
This is who you think she is.

1370
01:22:54,440 --> 01:22:57,400 
This is who she really is.

1371
01:22:58,480 --> 01:23:01,360 
Here's the dealio.

1372
01:23:01,440 --> 01:23:03,760 
I'm not either of those girls
Meredith showed you.

1373
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:05,360 
I'm both.

1374
01:23:05,480 --> 01:23:08,560 
I love science and math
and my parents,

1375
01:23:08,640 --> 01:23:10,280 
a lot,

1376
01:23:10,360 --> 01:23:12,280 
but I have a passion for fashion.

1377
01:23:12,360 --> 01:23:14,480 
It's how I express who I am.

1378
01:23:14,600 --> 01:23:16,040 
And if I can't do that,

1379
01:23:16,120 --> 01:23:17,160 
I'm nobody.

1380
01:23:17,280 --> 01:23:19,680 
I want everyone in my life
to accept that.

1381
01:23:19,680 --> 01:23:20,720 
Sorry.

1382
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:22,440 
Pathetic, isn't it?

1383
01:23:22,560 --> 01:23:25,440 
Well, nowhere as pathetic as this.

1384
01:23:25,440 --> 01:23:28,280 
Exhibit B, the soccer jock.

1385
01:23:28,280 --> 01:23:30,880 
All-American girl, the perfect daughter,

1386
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:31,960 
you decide.

1387
01:23:32,040 --> 01:23:34,920 
When her mother
desperately needed a job,

1388
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:36,640 
my family was kind enough

1389
01:23:36,720 --> 01:23:40,280 
to offer her employment as our maid.

1390
01:23:40,400 --> 01:23:42,480 
And how did her daughter
repay this kindness?

1391
01:23:42,600 --> 01:23:47,760 
By stealing my favorite, most beloved dolly.

1392
01:23:47,880 --> 01:23:51,040 
Ow. Still hurts.

1393
01:23:51,040 --> 01:23:52,760 
Look, it's true.

1394
01:23:52,840 --> 01:23:55,040 
My mom did clean Meredith's house.

1395
01:23:55,040 --> 01:23:59,160 
She would do anything
to provide for us.

1396
01:23:59,280 --> 01:24:01,000 
My mom...

1397
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:04,760 
My mom is my hero.

1398
01:24:10,120 --> 01:24:11,840 
But I never took your doll.

1399
01:24:11,920 --> 01:24:13,480 
Actually, I did.

1400
01:24:13,560 --> 01:24:15,400 
You were using it as a doorstop.

1401
01:24:15,400 --> 01:24:17,400 
I eavesdropped on my sister.

1402
01:24:17,480 --> 01:24:18,760 
And then I betrayed her.

1403
01:24:18,840 --> 01:24:21,640 
Yasmin, I'm very sorry.

1404
01:24:21,640 --> 01:24:23,840 
Most of my friends
think I'm a tough jock,

1405
01:24:23,920 --> 01:24:27,000 
but I've been taking ballet
since I was 5.

1406
01:24:27,080 --> 01:24:28,520 
And you know what? I like it.

1407
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:32,280 
I cheated on my pop quiz

1408
01:24:32,360 --> 01:24:35,720 
and my midterm, and my final.

1409
01:24:35,800 --> 01:24:37,240 
I'm Bubbie,

1410
01:24:37,360 --> 01:24:39,080 
and I am a chocoholic.

1411
01:24:39,080 --> 01:24:40,800 
- Hi, Bubbie.
- Hi, Bubbie.

1412
01:24:42,160 --> 01:24:44,720 
Meredith, this one's for you.

1413
01:24:51,360 --> 01:24:53,160 
# We got that Bratitude #

1414
01:24:53,280 --> 01:24:54,800 
# It's not that attitude #

1415
01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:56,920 
# We got that Bratitude #

1416
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:58,440 
# Yeah, come on #

1417
01:24:59,400 --> 01:25:02,680 
# There's a voice inside of me #

1418
01:25:02,760 --> 01:25:06,120 
# Set it free, set it free, set it free #

1419
01:25:06,200 --> 01:25:09,960 
# And it lives way
down deep in my soul #

1420
01:25:10,040 --> 01:25:13,400 
# Let it go, let it go, let it go. #

1421
01:25:13,520 --> 01:25:16,960 
# Come with me on this ride #

1422
01:25:17,040 --> 01:25:20,040 
# Soar with me through the sky #

1423
01:25:20,040 --> 01:25:23,760 
# You can't hide,
you can't hide, you can't hide #

1424
01:25:23,760 --> 01:25:25,480 
# Everyone, listen up #

1425
01:25:25,480 --> 01:25:28,760 
# They say my Bratitude
is just an attitude #

1426
01:25:28,840 --> 01:25:30,880 
# Gonna take the latitude #

1427
01:25:30,880 --> 01:25:32,400 
# To say that it's okay #

1428
01:25:32,480 --> 01:25:33,920 
# It's not a platitude #

1429
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:35,840 
# To feel some gratitude #

1430
01:25:35,840 --> 01:25:37,960 
# So show your Bratitude #

1431
01:25:38,040 --> 01:25:39,800 
# To the world today #

1432
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:47,440 
# Express yourself and you'll see #

1433
01:25:47,440 --> 01:25:50,240 
# Set it free, set it free,
set it free #

1434
01:25:50,320 --> 01:25:54,280 
# One on one, all together, you know #

1435
01:25:54,360 --> 01:25:57,240 
# Let it go, let it go, let it go #

1436
01:25:58,480 --> 01:26:01,440 
# Believe in all you are #

1437
01:26:01,560 --> 01:26:04,640 
# Let your spirit soar #

1438
01:26:04,720 --> 01:26:08,080 
# This power will open the door #

1439
01:26:08,160 --> 01:26:09,880 
# Now you know, listen up #

1440
01:26:10,680 --> 01:26:12,600 
# Ay ay ay ay #

1441
01:26:12,680 --> 01:26:14,120 
# It's not an attitude #

1442
01:26:14,200 --> 01:26:15,360 
# Ay ay ay ay #

1443
01:26:16,240 --> 01:26:17,480 
# It's not a platitude #

1444
01:26:17,480 --> 01:26:18,920 
# Ay ay ay ay #

1445
01:26:20,080 --> 01:26:23,040 
# To feel some gratitude
Ay ay ay ay #

1446
01:26:23,120 --> 01:26:24,560 
# Bratitude #

1447
01:26:24,680 --> 01:26:26,960 
# You know my Bratitude
is not an attitude #

1448
01:26:27,080 --> 01:26:31,080 
# Gotta take the latitude
to say that it's okay #

1449
01:26:31,080 --> 01:26:34,560 
# It's not a platitude
to feel some gratitude #

1450
01:26:34,640 --> 01:26:37,520 
# So show your Bratitude
in each and every way #

1451
01:26:40,960 --> 01:26:44,320 
# That's what we call #

1452
01:26:44,440 --> 01:26:48,160 
# Bratitude #

1453
01:26:48,240 --> 01:26:51,600 
# That's what we call #

1454
01:26:51,720 --> 01:26:55,640 
# Bratitude #

1455
01:26:55,720 --> 01:26:58,800 
# There ain't no difference
who you are #

1456
01:26:58,920 --> 01:27:02,280 
# No ifs, no buts, no maybes #

1457
01:27:02,360 --> 01:27:05,320 
# Just follow our lead, be fearless #

1458
01:27:05,320 --> 01:27:09,640 
# There's no limit, don't you worry #

1459
01:27:09,760 --> 01:27:11,480 
# B-rat tat tat tat #

1460
01:27:11,560 --> 01:27:15,320 
# The Bratz got your back #

1461
01:27:15,400 --> 01:27:17,240 
# So get up on your feet #

1462
01:27:17,320 --> 01:27:19,040 
# Let's take it to the street #

1463
01:27:19,120 --> 01:27:22,400 
# To everyone you'll meet today #

1464
01:27:24,120 --> 01:27:25,760 
# We got it #

1465
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:28,160 
# We'll share it, we'll show it #

1466
01:27:28,160 --> 01:27:30,640 
# Want the whole world
to know it #

1467
01:27:30,760 --> 01:27:32,680 
# We got it #

1468
01:27:32,680 --> 01:27:35,040 
# We'll share it, we'll show it #

1469
01:27:35,160 --> 01:27:36,800 
# Want the whole world to know it #

1470
01:27:36,880 --> 01:27:39,480 
# They say my Bratitude
is just an attitude #

1471
01:27:39,560 --> 01:27:43,320 
# Gonna take the latitude
to say that it's okay #

1472
01:27:43,320 --> 01:27:46,680 
# It's not a platitude
to feel some gratitude #

1473
01:27:46,760 --> 01:27:50,200 
You go on that stage, and
I am never speaking to you again.

1474
01:27:50,320 --> 01:27:51,560 
You know what?

1475
01:27:51,560 --> 01:27:53,560 
That's the best offer
I've heard all day.

1476
01:27:53,680 --> 01:27:58,280 
# There's a voice deep inside of me #

1477
01:27:58,360 --> 01:28:01,720 
# Set it free, set it free, set it free #

1478
01:28:01,800 --> 01:28:05,080 
# One on one,
all together, you know #

1479
01:28:05,080 --> 01:28:07,360 
# Let it go, let it go, let it go #

1480
01:28:07,480 --> 01:28:09,400 
# B! Bratz style we'll be bringin' #

1481
01:28:09,480 --> 01:28:11,040 
# R! The right way to be singin' #

1482
01:28:11,120 --> 01:28:12,760 
# A! We always keep it real #

1483
01:28:12,760 --> 01:28:14,760 
# T! Stick together, it's the deal #

1484
01:28:14,760 --> 01:28:16,280 
# I! Tell me, girl, what lives inside #

1485
01:28:16,400 --> 01:28:18,040 
# T! To be true and always try #

1486
01:28:18,120 --> 01:28:20,240 
# U-D-E! Express yourself #

1487
01:28:20,320 --> 01:28:21,960 
# Express yourself #

1488
01:28:22,040 --> 01:28:24,640 
# Riding high with our Bratitude #

1489
01:28:24,640 --> 01:28:28,200 
# That is why we got Bratitude #

1490
01:28:28,280 --> 01:28:31,840 
# We can fly with our Bratitude #

1491
01:28:31,920 --> 01:28:35,200 
# Don't deny we got Bratitude #

1492
01:28:35,200 --> 01:28:38,840 
# Riding high with our Bratitude #

1493
01:28:38,920 --> 01:28:42,560 
# That is why we got Bratitude #

1494
01:28:42,680 --> 01:28:45,640 
# We can fly with our Bratitude #

1495
01:28:45,640 --> 01:28:48,040 
# Don't deny that #

1496
01:28:48,120 --> 01:28:50,840 
# We got #

1497
01:28:50,920 --> 01:28:56,080 
# Bra-ti-tude #

1498
01:29:01,760 --> 01:29:02,800 
# Hey #

1499
01:29:15,360 --> 01:29:17,680 
Oh, that was so good!

1500
01:29:17,760 --> 01:29:19,120 
Yes!

1501
01:29:19,200 --> 01:29:21,240 
Yeah!

1502
01:29:29,960 --> 01:29:33,600 
You were all absolutely wonderful.

1503
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:35,600 
And the winner is...

1504
01:29:37,320 --> 01:29:38,880 
It's a tie.

1505
01:29:40,120 --> 01:29:41,160 
It's a tie.

1506
01:29:41,160 --> 01:29:43,560 
Well, we... That's a first.

1507
01:29:43,560 --> 01:29:45,680 
So I guess we just...
We'II, uh...

1508
01:29:45,760 --> 01:29:48,480 
I'd like to present
the Golden Hatchet

1509
01:29:48,560 --> 01:29:51,240 
to Meredith Baxter Dimly.

1510
01:29:51,320 --> 01:29:53,160 
I really didn't see this coming.

1511
01:29:53,240 --> 01:29:56,320 
I won, I won, I won, I won!

1512
01:29:56,440 --> 01:29:58,720 
Look, everyone. I won.

1513
01:29:59,880 --> 01:30:01,520 
- Thank you.
- Yes.

1514
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:06,320 
Now, the scholarship
goes to the Bratz!

1515
01:30:21,760 --> 01:30:25,760 
Meredith. Tom McShavie,
Vice President, MTV Networks.

1516
01:30:25,880 --> 01:30:27,800 
- Great show.
- Thank you.

1517
01:30:27,880 --> 01:30:30,000 
I caught your MTV
My Super Sweet 16,

1518
01:30:30,080 --> 01:30:32,080 
and it's got the best numbers to date.

1519
01:30:32,200 --> 01:30:34,200 
You in the pool. Outrageous.

1520
01:30:34,320 --> 01:30:35,760 
My idea.

1521
01:30:35,840 --> 01:30:37,360 
Smart girl.

1522
01:30:37,480 --> 01:30:39,400 
Oh, but you four girls, whoa.

1523
01:30:39,480 --> 01:30:42,920 
You have got superstar
written all over you.

1524
01:30:42,920 --> 01:30:43,880 
- We do?
- They do?

1525
01:30:43,880 --> 01:30:45,160 
Without question.

1526
01:30:45,240 --> 01:30:48,400 
We're having a movie premiere
next Saturday night.

1527
01:30:48,480 --> 01:30:51,560 
How would you girls like to be
the featured act on the red carpet?

1528
01:30:51,560 --> 01:30:54,080 
Two words. Uh, duh!

1529
01:30:54,080 --> 01:30:55,600 
Fantastic.

1530
01:30:55,600 --> 01:30:57,520 
- We'll be in touch.
- Oh, no way.

1531
01:30:57,600 --> 01:31:00,280 
Oh, my God, the red carpet!

1532
01:31:00,400 --> 01:31:01,720 
Oh, my God, the scholarship!

1533
01:31:01,720 --> 01:31:05,080 
Which...

1534
01:31:05,200 --> 01:31:07,000 
we want to give to you, Cloe.

1535
01:31:07,120 --> 01:31:10,080 
You're going to college,
no ifs, ands, or buts.

1536
01:31:10,160 --> 01:31:11,400 
For real?

1537
01:31:11,400 --> 01:31:14,480 
Oh, I love you guys!

1538
01:31:14,600 --> 01:31:17,840 
We are truly best friends forever.

1539
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:25,720 
BFFs!

1540
01:31:25,800 --> 01:31:28,000 
Even better.

1541
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,040 
Bratz!

1542
01:31:54,760 --> 01:31:56,680 
I totally would've won
that scholarship.

1543
01:31:56,800 --> 01:31:58,880 
Well, dear, there's
always the next time.

1544
01:32:08,760 --> 01:32:10,680 
No, there is not a next time.

1545
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:11,760 
I'm graduating.

1546
01:32:11,840 --> 01:32:13,960 
Oh, yes.

1547
01:32:14,040 --> 01:32:16,840 
Congratulations, dear.

1548
01:32:21,920 --> 01:32:23,360 
Easy, easy, easy, girl.

1549
01:34:02,880 --> 01:34:03,760 
Whoo!
