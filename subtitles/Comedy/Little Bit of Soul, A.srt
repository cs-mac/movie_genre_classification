00:00:57,516 --> 00:01:02,738
(Instrumental music)

2
00:01:06,817 --> 00:01:10,867
(Marley): Come on, let’s go.
Come on, kiddo.

3
00:01:10,946 --> 00:01:13,665
- We're going to have some fun.
- (Cammie):Yeah!

4
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:17,495
(Marley):You know I'm the best friend ever.
Now get out of here.

5
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:20,752
- (Renee): Have fun.
- We won't be back 'til after five, so

6
00:01:20,831 --> 00:01:23,550
- have lots of sex with your husband.
- Marley!

7
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:27,505
Hot, steamy, unbridled sex.

8
00:01:28,547 --> 00:01:31,801
(Loud laughing)

9
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:34,602
Thank you. You all have fun.
Be good for Marley.

10
00:01:34,678 --> 00:01:36,601
(Marley): We're gonna be good, Mommy.

11
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,853
- No sugar,
- Course not.

12
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:42,152
- She said no sugar.
- Love you, Mommy.

13
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:45,276
Take care.
Have fun with her.

14
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:47,949
Make that magic happen!

15
00:01:48,025 --> 00:01:50,323
- Ready, baby?
- Yes.

16
00:01:50,402 --> 00:01:53,827
- What are we gonna do today?
- Go get some sugar.

17
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:55,498
What?! Sugar?

18
00:01:55,574 --> 00:01:59,954
(Voice over Marley): If you think
this is what I want out of life,

19
00:02:00,037 --> 00:02:03,962
you know, the whole matrimonial,
maternal fairy tale, you're wrong.

20
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:07,341
It's not for me and that's okay,
because this idea

21
00:02:07,419 --> 00:02:11,549
that you have to fall in love
in order to live happily ever after

22
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:13,259
is just not true.

23
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:20,231
(Marley): Stanley...

24
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:21,809
Stanley...
(snoring)

25
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:26,689
you gotta get up, buddy.
I gotta go to work.

26
00:02:26,772 --> 00:02:28,866
Hey!
(laughs)

27
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:32,827
Yeah, good morning.

28
00:02:34,613 --> 00:02:36,490
Oh, Shit.

29
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:41,124

00:03:08,397 --> 00:03:10,695
There he is.
Good morning.

00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:17,827

- Thank you.

00:04:11,126 --> 00:04:14,175
- Wow!
- You need to watch where you're going.

55
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:19,010
Hello. Poster child for not mixing
wine with vodka.

56
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:21,470
You drank twice as much.
How are you okay?

57
00:04:21,553 --> 00:04:23,555
- Are you okay?
- Ohhh.

58
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:25,265
Are you? Say yes.

59
00:04:26,308 --> 00:04:27,400
Ohhh!

60
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:40,289
- Glad you could join us. Ready?
- I thought you were doing this.

61
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:43,583
Okay, why don't we start.
Marley?

62
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:49,960
- Good morning.
- Morning.

63
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:53,255
I'm sure this town
has been pitching the hell out of you,

64
00:04:53,335 --> 00:04:55,133
so I won't bother with that.

65
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:57,802
But I will tell you
that you'll never be number one

66
00:04:57,881 --> 00:05:00,851
as long as your customer base
is 82 percent male.

67
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:04,681
Yes. Well, women don't buy condoms.

68
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:08,188
(Marley laughing)
Not yours.

69
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:12,521
Come on, gentlemen.
As I'm sure you're all painfully aware,

70
00:05:12,604 --> 00:05:17,155
it is women, myself included,
who dictate when, where,

71
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:21,535
how, with whom and how many times
we're going to have sex.

72
00:05:21,613 --> 00:05:24,958
We can't always count on the man
to have condoms lying around.

73
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:29,664
So we actually do go buy them
and then we end up in the condom aisle

74
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:33,125
with a choice.
So which brand do we buy?

75
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:37,759
Do we buy Trojan, whose very name
conjures the essence of

76
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:40,591
penetration with protection?

77
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:44,850
Or do we choose the one
with the skanky-looking girl,

78
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:46,396
with big tits,

79
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:50,396
skimpy shorts
and stripper pumps?

80
00:05:58,483 --> 00:05:59,655
I'll keep this one.

81
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:04,490
(Champagne popping,
ambient sounds)

82
00:06:04,573 --> 00:06:06,667
- Hey!
- Yay! Hi, baby.

83
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:10,962
She had them and their condoms
wrapped around her little finger.

84
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:13,290
- Alright!
- To the youngest, the hottest

85
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:16,217
vice president
in the history of advertising.

86
00:06:16,293 --> 00:06:18,967
(Cheering, toasting)

87
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:21,260
You should think about
buying a house now.

88
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:24,434
Yeah, why take the time
to stop and smell the roses?

89
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:28,685
What you need is a big, fat mortgage
like an albatross around your neck.

90
00:06:30,307 --> 00:06:35,814
Okay, in honour of Marley's
white-trash taste buds we have...

91
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:38,319
Mac and cheese pizza?

92
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:41,447
You know what I want
for my birthday? Your metabolism.

93
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:44,700
I'll trade you my metabolism
for those boobs.

94
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:47,453
Throw in that necklace
and you've got a deal.

95
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:49,125
Baby, that's a good trade.

96
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,704
Hey. She's gonna have her own boobs
soon enough.

97
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:54,755
Way to keep a secret, Marley.

98
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:58,009
- Are you getting implants?
- No.

99
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,961
- I'm pregnant.
- You're pregnant?

100
00:07:00,045 --> 00:07:02,173
- Cammie's getting a brother.
- Another one.

101
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:04,553
But we're not ruling out
the implant thing.

102
00:07:04,633 --> 00:07:07,432
- You're disgusting.
- Cheers. To you, Marley.

103
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,807
To us.

104
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:11,436
- Bye, you guys.
- Good luck out there.

105
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:16,395
- Congratulations on the new boy.
- May he be happy and healthy.

106
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:21,234
- And may he have a huge penis.
- Geez! You are just terrible.

107
00:07:21,316 --> 00:07:24,570
- Speaking of terrible...
- Speed down.

108
00:07:24,653 --> 00:07:27,247
- Marley made a booty call.
- Shut up.

109
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:29,745
- I'm serious, baby.
- Bye, good night.

110
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:32,168
Good night, Doug.

111
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:34,337
- Love you.
- Love you.

112
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:36,915
Hey, Doug. Wanna come over?

113
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:41,174
Oh, you're coming over.
No, you are coming over.

114
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:43,596
(Marley moaning and screaming,
Stanley growling)

115
00:07:43,672 --> 00:07:45,891
(Marley): Oh, my God! Oh!

116
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:47,843
(Stanley barking, scratching)

117
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:48,973
(Marley): Oh!

118
00:07:49,052 --> 00:07:51,805
(Sighing)

119
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:59,897
Mmm, not bad, mister.

120
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:03,655
Not bad at all.
(Stanley howling)

121
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:07,203
Oh!
(Marley giggling)

122
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:10,657
So, does this mean
I actually get to spend the night?

123
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:15,917
I mean, I love being the first number
on the booty call list, but...

124
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:18,999
Well, second?

125
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:22,260
Sure.

126
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:25,763
What if I want something more?

127
00:08:26,965 --> 00:08:29,059
What if I don't?

128
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,397
Really?

129
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:37,896
I thought we made that clear
when we met.

130
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:42,527
That's what people say at first,
so no one gets hurt.

131
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:46,906
Not me.
(Stanley barking, scratching door)

132
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:55,912
Oh! What? Oh, my goodness.
I love you. I love you.

133
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:58,580
Real.

134
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:02,588
That's not real. Got it?
- Yes.

135
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:06,046
Real. Okay?
Not real.

136
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:07,631
- Fake.
- Fake.

137
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:11,218
Silicon Valley. Got it?
You sure?

138
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:14,475
Here's a little something
to celebrate your promotion.

139
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:18,775
Thank you, Mommy.
Such a kind mama.

140
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,990
Okay. Let's see.

141
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:31,072
'Congratulations from your best friends
forever. Renee, Thomas and Cammie.'

142
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:33,782
Oh, you're so good with words.

143
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:45,919
Is this the actual gift, or are you
setting me up with him?

144
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:51,224
The idea is: You take him out
and you, um, put a real man in it.

145
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:55,270
(Marley laughing)
- What? Like maybe Doug.

146
00:09:57,347 --> 00:09:58,940
- Who?
- Ohhh.

147
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:01,689
Come on.
We all know he wasn't a keeper.

148
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:03,816
- Poor Doug.
- No poor Doug.

149
00:10:03,895 --> 00:10:06,193
- Ohhh.
- Thank you.

150
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:07,990
Thank you.

151
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:12,784
Could you tell him
that Marley Corbett called?

152
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:15,411
Yeah, that'd be great.
Bye, bye.

153
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:20,746
Okay, I gotta say something.

154
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:24,174
I think this vice-presidency
is making your tits smaller.

155
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:25,592
Really?

156
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:27,969
Yeah.

157
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:29,466
- Really?
- Hm hum.

158
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:31,548
- Hey.
- Hey, Rob.

159
00:10:32,674 --> 00:10:37,020
- Think Marley's tits are shrinking?
- Like, right now?

160
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:40,019
- No, in general.
- Uh, yeah.

161
00:10:41,516 --> 00:10:45,111
- How are we doing on Coffee Land?
- Great. Our favourite so far.

162
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:48,565
'Drink this dark-flavoured spit
and it'll make you shit'

163
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:51,572
- Tell him the others.
- Can't. He has to be across town at 1,

164
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:54,279
back here for storyboards at 3
and dinner at 6,

165
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:57,206
and after dinner we have drinks
with the Home Depot.

166
00:10:57,282 --> 00:10:59,831
That's why I love this woman.
I love you.

167
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:02,378
Jesus. He's running you ragged.

168
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:06,709
You look-- not so good.

169
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:11,012
- When did you last see a doctor?
- Does Dr. Phil count?

170
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:14,474
(Instrumental music)

171
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:20,389
(dropping sounds)

172
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:22,223
Ow!

173
00:11:24,976 --> 00:11:26,273
Shit.

174
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:28,446
(Door closing)
(Marley): Oh.

175
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:32,571
You look familiar.

176
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:36,621
- Have we had sex?
- No, um, I'm sorry.

177
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:40,371
Never mind.
I was just joking.

178
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:45,502
- Marley, I'm Dr. Goldstein.
- You're Dr-- Goldstein?

179
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:48,299
- Yes, I'm Jewish, from Mexico.
- No. I mean,

180
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:51,594
I just expected somebody older,
not so--

181
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,139
young.

182
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:56,842
Take a seat.

183
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,477
- So, Marley".
- Hmm.

184
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:08,528
- What seems to be the problem?
- Not so sure. Hence being here.

185
00:12:08,603 --> 00:12:12,483
Look up. So you've been experiencing
some weight loss, right?

186
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:15,660
- Umm...
- And you had some blood in your stool?

187
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:19,914
Yes, I've been experiencing

188
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:22,492
some of that bleeding
you're talking about.

189
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:27,046
Just lie on your back. I'm gonna
feel around your stomach, okay?

190
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:29,340
- Just relax.
- Okay.

191
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:33,011
(Marley giggling)

192
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:37,094
I'm kind of ticklish,
so don't be a wuss-

193
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:41,269
Don't get all feather-fing...
(Marley laughing)

194
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:46,565
Ow!

195
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:52,648
Okay, Marley,
we're gonna need to run some tests.

196
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:55,358
(James Brown music playing)

197
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:58,365
- Up! Time.
- Oh, no, no, no.

198
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:01,288
- Pens.
- There's still two more seconds left.

199
00:13:01,364 --> 00:13:04,334
- What are you doing?
- Down. Pens down.

200
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:07,128
Is it weird that
I always find the word 'slut'?

201
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:09,581
Too bad you only get two points
for 'slut'.

202
00:13:09,664 --> 00:13:13,510
Whore gets you three points.
(Marley laughing)

203
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:16,007
(timer going off)
Time.

204
00:13:16,087 --> 00:13:18,840
It's pink juice time.

205
00:13:22,677 --> 00:13:28,480
- Think of it like, like bubble gum urine.
- Yummy! Bottoms up.

206
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:33,814
Mmm. Uh mmm.

207
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:36,445
(Eerie music on TV)

208
00:13:37,692 --> 00:13:40,195
Isn't this stuff supposed
to clean you out?

209
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:42,030
Maybe you didn't do it right.

210
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:46,326
How can she not do it right?
She drank it.

211
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:53,710
Maybe she drank it too fast,
or, I don't know, too slow.

212
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,759
(Stanley grunting)

213
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:59,465
Ooh! Aw!
Yee-ha-ha.

214
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:01,675
(Peter): Let us know
when it starts working.

215
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:03,977
(Bathroom door slamming)
(Marley): Oh, my God!

216
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:05,599
(Stanley whining)

217
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:08,773
- Good morning, Marley.
- Oh, really.

218
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:12,523
Is it? I'm about to get a huge camera
stuck up my butt.

219
00:14:12,602 --> 00:14:14,900
So I don't know
if that qualifies as good.

220
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:19,200
I just need you to sign this document
which states that you understand

221
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:23,280
all the colonoscopy's risks,
which include heavy bleeding, uh,

222
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:26,583
infection, perforation, rupture.

223
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:29,911
On a scale of one to ten,
one being 'never'

224
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:32,289
and ten being 'happens all the time',

225
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:35,922
what are the chances of you
rupturing my ass?

226
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,005
Well, not.
The chances are very slim.

227
00:14:40,088 --> 00:14:44,059
It's, uh, more procedural.

228
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:48,309
Good, well, procedure away,
my friend.

229
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:49,856
This is gonna be fun.

230
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:53,939
Would you mind rolling
onto your left side, please.

231
00:14:56,187 --> 00:14:58,656
(Cheerful instrumental music)

232
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:05,705
(sound of rubber gloves
being put on)

233
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:10,793
Thanks-
(sound of air in hose)

234
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:12,586
Wait a minute.

235
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:19,052
Before we go to whatever base
this is we're going to, um,

236
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:23,010
shouldn't I know your first name?

237
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:27,473
Julian.

238
00:15:27,552 --> 00:15:31,807
Julian.
(Marley laughing)

239
00:15:34,225 --> 00:15:36,853
Julian Goldstein.

240
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:44,493
My hero.
(Marley laughing loudly)

241
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:49,202
(echo of Marley laughing)

242
00:15:56,998 --> 00:15:58,966
(instrumental music)

243
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:07,809
Where the hell am I?

244
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:18,061
(Wind blowing)

245
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:25,569
- Hello, Marley.
- Oh, my God.

246
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:30,531
Wait a minute. Oh, my God.
I mean...

247
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:33,997
- Are you God?
- Not really.

248
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:36,295
This is just the way
you wanted to see me.

249
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:40,500
Well, I love Whoopi,
so that's probably why.

250
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:44,304
Yeah, me too.
Oh, have a seat.

251
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:45,971
Wow!

252
00:16:50,218 --> 00:16:53,062
- I can't believe this.
- Guess what?

253
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:56,482
- You're dying.
- I am not dying.

254
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:59,606
I'm just a little stressed,
that's all.

255
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:00,982
Marley?

256
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:06,026
You're dying,
but I'm gonna give you three wishes.

257
00:17:08,653 --> 00:17:11,076
Then I want to

258
00:17:13,658 --> 00:17:16,081
- fly.
- Okay. Done.

259
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,414
Wait a minute.
This is for real?

260
00:17:19,497 --> 00:17:23,343
- I want a million bucks.
- Alright, but I just have to warn you

261
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:26,637
that that is only gonna be
500,000 after taxes.

262
00:17:26,921 --> 00:17:30,721
- Just 'cause I didn't say 'tax free'?
- Even I don't mess with the IRS.

263
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,268
That sucks.

264
00:17:36,347 --> 00:17:37,815
Third wish?

265
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:42,028
Okay. Let me think.

266
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:47,445
- Tic-toc, baby.
- Don't rush me. Jesus.

267
00:17:47,525 --> 00:17:49,698
- Hey, hey.
- Oh.

268
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:51,279
- Wow.
- I'm sorry.

269
00:17:51,362 --> 00:17:53,285
- You said it, didn't you?
- Yeah, I did.

270
00:17:53,364 --> 00:17:54,786
Wow.

271
00:17:57,493 --> 00:18:01,589
I don't know.
I don't know what I want.

272
00:18:01,664 --> 00:18:04,543
You know.
You just don't want to admit it.

273
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:08,425
But I'm pretty sure
that if you give it some thought,

274
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:10,552
you'll figure it out.

275
00:18:12,675 --> 00:18:14,222
(God): Marley.

276
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:17,851
(Julian): Marley.

277
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,353
Marley, wake up.
It's over.

278
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:24,191
What's over?

279
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:27,489
Where am I?

280
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:30,321
Where's Whoopi?

281
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,454
The procedure went fine.

282
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:36,248
We're going to move you
to the recovery room now.

283
00:18:36,324 --> 00:18:41,797
I took some biopsies.
We should get results in a few days.

284
00:18:41,871 --> 00:18:43,464
- It's delicious.
- I agree.

285
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:46,793
It's crunchy and chewy. Peter,
I'd like to share mine with you.

286
00:18:46,876 --> 00:18:48,799
Here, Pop. I'll go.
(Marley laughing)

287
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:52,223
(Sarah makes choking sounds)
Hey, behave.

288
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:54,767
Geez, what the hell?

289
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:59,848
Okay. Alright, alright. I forgot
to cook the noodles first.

290
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:02,729
- Ohhh.
- There's noodles in this?

291
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:05,527
(Peter): Do not feed this to Stanley.
Take it.

292
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:07,605
(Renee): No.
I got all this on my plate.

293
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:10,783
I have cancer.
(everyone continues laughing)

294
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:12,326
(sudden silence)

295
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:16,155
I went to the doctor last week.
Remember?

296
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:20,163
I said I was fine
and that I was just stressed, but

297
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:22,711
- I'm not.
- What are you talking about?

298
00:19:22,787 --> 00:19:24,130
I have, um,

299
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:29,256
colon cancer.
How does one get that, you might ask.

300
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:32,714
Because I did.
And, um,

301
00:19:34,382 --> 00:19:37,932
- he said...
- We don't know.

302
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,728
Of course you don't.

303
00:19:41,639 --> 00:19:43,937
Everyone is dying of cancer
these days.

304
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:47,646
Why would you try to figure it out
and put yourself out of a job?

305
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:52,985
I know this is rough, but we need
to talk about what to do next.

306
00:19:53,067 --> 00:19:57,493
I'm going to consult with the head
of the oncology department, Dr. Sanders.

307
00:19:57,571 --> 00:20:01,621
Can, can, can you just take it out,
so I can go on with my life?

308
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:03,795
No, unfortunately we can't.

309
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:06,964
It's already spread
throughout the entire colon,

310
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,713
making surgery impossible
at this point.

311
00:20:11,502 --> 00:20:14,096
And this other guy
would have a better idea?

312
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:15,593
Dr. Sanders, yes.

313
00:20:15,673 --> 00:20:20,770
He's one of the best in the country
for-- late stage cancers.

314
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:27,060
Marley,
at this point you only have two options.

315
00:20:27,143 --> 00:20:30,989
Either you start treatment immediately,
or you'll die.

316
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:36,285
Ah.

317
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,534
Okay Dr. G., I'm gonna give you
a little free advice.

318
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:42,162
Don't use the 'D' word.
It's a bit of a downer.

319
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,460
And if you're trying
to sell me treatment,

320
00:20:44,535 --> 00:20:49,041
I would rethink the 'B' option,
because dying isn't an option.

321
00:20:49,123 --> 00:20:52,844
Maybe try something like:
'Try our new and improved chemo,

322
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:55,637
because the alternative
will leave you breathless!

323
00:20:55,713 --> 00:20:59,343
When your 2:30 walks in here
and you have to tell him that he's dying,

324
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:01,894
just try it with a little more feeling.

325
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:09,439
(Door slamming)
Anyway-- who wants dessert?

326
00:21:20,196 --> 00:21:22,494
Mom? Hi.

327
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:26,035
Sorry to call so late.

328
00:21:29,455 --> 00:21:30,957
(Sobbing)

329
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:35,086
Mom, I'm okay.

330
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:41,141
(Blowing nose loudly)

331
00:21:44,345 --> 00:21:47,474
I'll make sure that you
get the best possible treatment.

332
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:51,561
- I don't care how much it costs.
- You're going to buy her a new colon?

333
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:53,317
I will not have
a money discussion.

334
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:55,739
The gloves are coming off.

335
00:21:55,815 --> 00:21:58,318
Money is the only thing
you can talk about.

336
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,997
Marley needs our love and support.
At least pretend to be here for her.

337
00:22:03,072 --> 00:22:06,121
I don't have to pretend.
That's your department.

338
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:12,297
I'm so glad we got together.

339
00:22:17,545 --> 00:22:19,388
So what did you tell Rob?

340
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:21,799
- That I have mono.
- Right.

341
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:23,384
And I'm working from home.

342
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:25,845
I don't want anybody
from work knowing.

343
00:22:25,928 --> 00:22:29,933
I got it.
Your butt is your business.

344
00:22:30,975 --> 00:22:32,602
Huh? Huh?

345
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:35,438
- My Dad flew out this morning-
- Is your Mom happy?

346
00:22:35,521 --> 00:22:37,694
So much so she's celebrating
by moving here.

347
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:42,153

- Get the phone.

- What?

358
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:16,946
- Quick, Marley.
-(DJ): Code 9797.

359
00:23:17,021 --> 00:23:19,991

- Hey, how you doing?
- Not too good.

367
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:05,278
Yo, J. G.

368
00:24:05,361 --> 00:24:08,160
- Hi.
- How's it hanging?

369
00:24:09,657 --> 00:24:11,785
Um-- good.

370
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:14,040
You here
to work on your bedside manner?

371
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:17,874
- No. Checking on some test results.
- Ah. Of course.

372
00:24:17,957 --> 00:24:21,052
- Are you on your own?
- Why? Want to keep me company?

373
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:22,719
Yeah.

374
00:24:28,968 --> 00:24:32,472
- How do you feel?
- To be honest, I could use a good laugh.

375
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:36,104
- Want me to tell you a joke?
- I'd prefer someone funny.

376
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:39,110
Alright. What? Go.

377
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:46,201
Okay, um, there's this guy that...

378
00:24:46,276 --> 00:24:49,155
No-- It doesn't work.

379
00:24:49,238 --> 00:24:52,117
It doesn't work,
because you just put me on the spot.

380
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:54,418
Did you hear about the medical student

381
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:57,542
who interrupted the proctologist
during a lecture?

382
00:24:57,621 --> 00:25:00,591
He said: "Excuse me, sir, um,

383
00:25:00,666 --> 00:25:04,261
uh-- is that a rectal thermometer
behind your ear?"

384
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:09,388
The proctologist touched behind his ear
and said: "Oh, shit!

385
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:12,265
Some asshole stole my pen."

386
00:25:15,305 --> 00:25:17,899
You can use that one.
I've got so many more.

387
00:25:19,268 --> 00:25:22,522
- You know, it's okay to feel nervous.
- I'm not.

388
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:24,857
Not really.

389
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:27,318
- I just..
-(Nurse): Marley Corbett?

390
00:25:36,035 --> 00:25:38,003
- Wish me luck.
- You don't need it.

391
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:40,297
- You'll do great.
- Yes!

392
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:52,843
What are you doing here?

393
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:55,304
(Marley sighing)
Just getting caught up.

394
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:57,014
It's Saturday. Go home.

395
00:25:58,057 --> 00:26:01,982
- You look like shit.
- Mono's only moderately contagious.

396
00:26:02,061 --> 00:26:04,814
- It's so nice not having you around.
- Yeah.

397
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:07,491
By the way:
I licked all the water bottles.

398
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:09,193
(Makes licking sounds)

399
00:26:11,862 --> 00:26:13,739
Good afternoon.

(Ambient sounds)

401
00:26:16,075 --> 00:26:19,579
- Ummm.
- Hey! Oooh.

402
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:23,461
You. Hi. Wow.

403
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:27,170
Yeah, my belly button is in
a different zip code than the rest of me.

404
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:28,879
It just pops.

405
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:31,590
- How was the appointment?
- Oh, good.

406
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:36,053
My doctor says that
everything is good. Thank God.

407
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:41,896
- I'm sorry.
- That's okay.

408
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:45,900
'Cause I bet my doctor
is way cuter than your doctor.

409
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:50,530
Marley! Please tell me
you're not flirting with your doctor.

410
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:53,704
- So what if I am?
- Never mind.

411
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:55,907
- Say what you're gonna say.
- No, I...

412
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:59,285
Why do I feel like I'm more concerned
about this than you are?

413
00:26:59,368 --> 00:27:04,420
Shouldn't you focus on getting cured
rather than getting laid?

414
00:27:04,498 --> 00:27:06,592
Can’t I do both?

415
00:27:06,667 --> 00:27:11,047
Could you just for once
not treat everything like it was a joke?

It's good. I like it.

440

Plus, I learned from those ladies

what do you call a jazz musician

(Jazz music)

447
00:30:02,301 --> 00:30:06,852
- So that was incredible.
- He's been performing since he was 8.

448
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:10,651
- Wow!
- So, what are you doing now?

449
00:30:10,726 --> 00:30:13,445
Want to get
something to eat with me?

450
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:19,527
- Like, gefilte fish tacos, perhaps.
- No, I can't stay. I'd love to,

451
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:23,659
but it's not doctor protocol
to hang around with a patient.

452
00:30:23,739 --> 00:30:26,162
Well, I won't say anything
if you don't.

453
00:30:29,536 --> 00:30:31,959
I'm really fun.

454
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:38,925
How can I say no to that, right?

455
00:30:43,175 --> 00:30:46,224
Do you mind if I ask you
a personal question?

456
00:30:46,303 --> 00:30:49,227
- No.
- Why do you not have a girlfriend?

457
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:55,696
- Is it that obvious?
- Oh, yeah. Yup.

458
00:30:55,771 --> 00:30:59,867
- I practically live at the hospital.
- Not much of a life.

459
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:02,694
Actually, Dr. Sanders
called me to work here

out of more than 2000 applicants.
I can't sacrifice that for a personal life.

00:31:14,664 --> 00:31:17,133
Then why aren't you
in a relationship?

465
00:31:17,209 --> 00:31:20,554
Because I don't need to be in one
to have a personal life.

466
00:31:20,629 --> 00:31:23,678
- You're not answering the question.
- Well,

467
00:31:23,757 --> 00:31:27,933
read about it in my next book:
'Why relationships suck ass.'

468
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:31,641
You know, I've never met anyone
that talks so much

469
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:34,351
and says nothing at the same time.

470
00:31:35,394 --> 00:31:37,897
Okay. Fine.

471
00:31:39,106 --> 00:31:41,325
That was so...
(Marley laughing)

472
00:31:47,364 --> 00:31:48,832
This is me.

473
00:31:53,495 --> 00:31:56,499
And-- that's me over there.

474
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,718
Good night, Dr. G.

475
00:32:02,087 --> 00:32:03,384
Good night.

476
00:32:09,553 --> 00:32:11,476
(Stomping sounds)

477
00:32:11,555 --> 00:32:14,934
I'm making you
a nice, big, juicy steak.

478
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:19,021
Ma! I've been a vegetarian
for 12 years.

479
00:32:19,104 --> 00:32:22,108
Well, you need some protein.

480
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:25,493
Mm-hmm.

481
00:32:26,528 --> 00:32:29,031
By the way, your father called again.

482
00:32:30,532 --> 00:32:34,127
(nasally) He said he was going to do
his best to make it out here.

483
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:37,547
Blah, blah, blah.
(meal sizzling)

484
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:41,092
I don't know why you didn't have
your friend Sarah watch the dog.

485
00:32:41,168 --> 00:32:43,091
Then I could stay here with you.

486
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:46,049
Strike one.
Wanna try for two?

487
00:32:46,131 --> 00:32:48,930
Well, I can't control my allergies.

488
00:32:49,009 --> 00:32:51,057
Or her complaining.

489
00:32:51,136 --> 00:32:53,104
(Beverley sniffing)
I heard that.

490
00:32:55,849 --> 00:32:58,978
I just wanna help.
Tell me what to do.

491
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:01,108
Mom, you're here. That's enough.

492
00:33:01,188 --> 00:33:03,611
Would you go to a nutritionist
if I could arrange it?

493
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:05,613
- Mom!
- Everybody,

494
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:09,913
- swears by this macrobiotic diet.
- I don't want that heely-feely shit.

495
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:11,990
So just back off.

496
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:18,459
Oh, this steak is burning.

497
00:33:20,707 --> 00:33:22,630
Go rub some dander on her.

498
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:24,632
Go.
(Stanley whining)

499
00:33:27,506 --> 00:33:31,977
Shoo! Shoo! Call him, Marley.
Call him. That's not funny.

500
00:33:33,178 --> 00:33:36,057
Hi, Dr. Sanders. Marley.

501
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:38,566
Have a seat.

502
00:33:40,602 --> 00:33:44,357
- Is anyone joining you? Mother?
- Trust me,

503
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:46,487
neither of us wants her here.

504
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:47,692
(Door closing)

505
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:50,533
- Hi.
- Uh-oh.

506
00:33:50,612 --> 00:33:53,411
Two against one.
This can't be good.

507
00:33:55,075 --> 00:34:00,377
Marley, I'm sorry I have to say this,
but there's been no improvement.

508
00:34:01,831 --> 00:34:03,549
- Wait. What are you saying?

509
00:34:03,625 --> 00:34:06,754
The chemo hasn't worked
as we had hoped.

510
00:34:08,338 --> 00:34:11,262
And the tumours
have continued to grow.

511
00:34:11,341 --> 00:34:13,764
What now?
What...

512
00:34:13,843 --> 00:34:18,223
There is one particular clinical trial
that's had some success.

513
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:23,028
Although, typically with patients
who had better result from chemo.

514
00:34:23,103 --> 00:34:26,482
Success like people cured?

515
00:34:26,565 --> 00:34:28,988
- Yeah.
- What is it?

516
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:33,163
It's a series of treatments,
two times a week.

517
00:34:33,238 --> 00:34:35,240
It's injected into the affected areas.

518
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:40,250
The objective is to stop or slow down
the growth of the cancerous cells.

519
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:41,420
It's an option.

520
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:45,751
But you need to be aware that
the side effects are very extreme.

521
00:34:45,834 --> 00:34:48,007
There are no guarantees-

522
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:53,595
Of course.

523
00:34:55,176 --> 00:34:56,928
We have to do it.

524
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:02,442
So you're going to be a guinea pig?

525
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:05,487
It's not an experiment.
It's a clinical trial.

526
00:35:05,562 --> 00:35:08,691
What do you know about this trial?
What are the success rates?

527
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:11,276
- He said they're pretty good.
- <i>Pretty good?</i>

528
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:14,909
And that's it? You're going
to do it just off of that?

529
00:35:14,988 --> 00:35:18,868
Actually no, I flipped a coin.
Heads do it. Tails drop dead.

530
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:21,920
Look, I'm just saying
that we need to make sure this is

531
00:35:21,995 --> 00:35:25,215
- the appropriate course of action.
- Excuse me. We?

532
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:26,758
As in you, Mom and me?

533
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:29,837
When have you ever been around
to make any important decision?

534
00:35:29,919 --> 00:35:34,015
You know what? I'm not going to have
this conversation with you. I...

535
00:35:36,301 --> 00:35:37,974
(door slamming)

536
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:53,910
Will she be able to go home today?

537
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:56,579
Depends on how she responds
to the treatment.

538
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:00,701
Ow!

539
00:36:00,784 --> 00:36:03,628
Can I be here
while you do the procedure?

540
00:36:03,703 --> 00:36:04,829
No.

541
00:36:05,705 --> 00:36:07,707
I'm sorry, you cannot.

542
00:36:11,461 --> 00:36:12,587
(Monitor beeping)

543
00:36:12,671 --> 00:36:15,641
What if I'm very, very quiet?

544
00:36:16,675 --> 00:36:18,723
(Marley laughing)

545
00:36:20,136 --> 00:36:24,858
Sorry, but the concept of my mother
being quiet is incredibly funny.

546
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:27,690
It is.

547
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:35,198
-(Marley): Am I gonna lose my hair?
-(Doctor): No, your hair will be fine.

548
00:36:37,779 --> 00:36:40,202
-(Marley): Ow!
-(Doctor): I'm sorry.

549
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:56,598
"Roses are red, violets are blue,

550
00:36:57,716 --> 00:37:00,344
I've got ass cancer,

551
00:37:02,554 --> 00:37:04,932
now you know too."

552
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:08,484
Don't you feel guilty for
leaving me all those nasty messages

553
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,483
for missing work?

554
00:37:10,562 --> 00:37:12,064
Yeah, but I'm...

555
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:17,577
You should have come to me sooner.
Why did you keep it a secret?

556
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:21,282
Because I didn't want you
to look at me the way you are now.

557
00:37:28,747 --> 00:37:32,001
So, have you filed
with the insurance company?

558
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:34,711
Well, I'm not footing the bill
out of my salary.

559
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:36,762
No, I mean life insurance.

560
00:37:36,838 --> 00:37:41,139
Look, people recover from cancer
and, um,

561
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:45,017
however much money you need
to make that happen, I want you to have.

562
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:49,977
There's an option in the company policy
that says that anybody who has a

563
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:54,398
life-threatening illness

564
00:37:54,481 --> 00:37:57,360
- can cash out.
- Meaning how much?

565
00:37:58,401 --> 00:37:59,573
A million dollars.

566
00:37:59,652 --> 00:38:03,282
Let me guess. That would be
500,000 dollars after taxes.

567
00:38:05,033 --> 00:38:07,536
(Upbeat music)

568
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:10,168
I think my God will be Gucci.

569
00:38:11,623 --> 00:38:14,593
- Yeah, definitely.
- I think so.

570
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:18,880
- Oh, I love it.
- You can fight me for it.

571
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:21,807
I've got a big G for gorgeous.

572
00:38:21,883 --> 00:38:24,682
Cammie goes to college,
or Mommy gets this bag.

573
00:38:26,179 --> 00:38:27,601
(Sarah): Love you.

574
00:38:28,348 --> 00:38:29,395
(Peter): Okay.

575
00:38:29,474 --> 00:38:31,647
They're fabulous!

576
00:38:36,815 --> 00:38:38,533
I want you to have these.

577
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:44,702
Am I making you hot?

578
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:50,207
What kind of cologne is that?
He was flirting with me.

579
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:52,664
-(Marley): Oh, boy.
-(Sarah): You're so weird.

580
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:56,876
Hey-

581
00:38:57,919 --> 00:39:01,344
There's a maternity department upstairs.
Want to check that out?

582
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:06,679
You know-- I'm really tired.
I'm gonna go home and lie down.

583
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:10,265
Um, thank you so much for today.

584
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:13,101
- I'll call you later. I love you.
- I love you too.

585
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:20,821
(Sarah): I like that.

586
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:23,824
(Peter): Looks like something
a stripper would wear.

587
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:28,875
- Is everything okay?
- No. It's not okay.

588
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:31,499
- She's really sick.
- I know.

589
00:39:31,578 --> 00:39:35,833
I'm trying so hard to play along,
but I'm terrible at it.

590
00:39:35,915 --> 00:39:40,136
And I-- I just don't want
to ruin her day.

591
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:42,885
That's the last thing I want to do,
so-- bye.

592
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:49,637
I'll take her home.

593
00:39:54,726 --> 00:39:58,151
- No!
- It would look so nice on you.

594
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:02,826
- Yes, it would. If I was you.
- A simple 'no' would have sufficed.

595
00:40:02,901 --> 00:40:05,450
I don't need no clothes.
This is for you guys.

596
00:40:05,528 --> 00:40:08,748
Everything you own
is swimming on you.

597
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:13,374
- The swimming look is in.
- I just want my daughter to look good.

598
00:40:13,453 --> 00:40:15,797
When you look good, you feel good.

599
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:19,342
I don't need a new wardrobe
to feel good.

600
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:22,216
You also don't need
a negative attitude.

601
00:40:22,295 --> 00:40:25,549
You need to wake up and realize
I'm not getting any better.

602
00:40:25,632 --> 00:40:28,010
- Can we not do this here.
- No. Seriously!

603
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:31,312
You always bitch about
how Dad can't confront anything

604
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:33,389
and here you are
walking around in a haze,

605
00:40:33,473 --> 00:40:37,194
like protein and a designer dress
are going to cure my cancer.

606
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:46,278
Ahhhh!

607
00:40:47,904 --> 00:40:50,373
This is the car. This one.
Thank you.

608
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:54,203
- Was it really that bad?
- I heard you from Jimmy Choo.

609
00:40:55,495 --> 00:41:00,342
- It's just that she drives me crazy.
- Well, duh! She's your mom.

610
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:02,043
That's her job.

611
00:41:03,086 --> 00:41:05,805
- Thanks for everything.
- Thank you.

612
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:09,555
Ah. Ow. Ah.

613
00:41:10,593 --> 00:41:11,936
Marley.

614
00:41:12,971 --> 00:41:15,724
Hey. it's okay.

615
00:41:17,433 --> 00:41:19,606
Just give me a second.

616
00:41:20,979 --> 00:41:23,152
It's gonna be okay.

617
00:41:29,696 --> 00:41:32,415
- Is she gonna be alright?
- She's dehydrated.

618
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:35,118
A couple of bags of saline
and she'll be feeling better.

619
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:36,703
She is right here, people.

620
00:41:36,786 --> 00:41:39,209
'Shop 'til you drop'
is only an expression.

621
00:41:39,288 --> 00:41:40,915
Not bad.

622
00:41:40,999 --> 00:41:43,627
That's the best thing
I could come up with.

623
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:45,303
Dr. G.

624
00:41:45,378 --> 00:41:47,676
- Ah, hi.
- Hi. Hello.

625
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:50,975
GI extra ordinaire.
Artist extra ordinaire.

626
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:53,144
- Pleased to meet you.
- Nice to-- oh!

627
00:41:53,219 --> 00:41:54,266
I...

628
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:58,855
I'm suddenly in the mood for some Jell-O.
Do you need anything?

629
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:00,651
Really? Jell-O?

630
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:05,152
- I'm good. Thanks.
- Okay.

631
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:11,617
Strangely, she's not so good
with needles. Ouch!

632
00:42:11,696 --> 00:42:15,496
- So what happened?
- I don't know. I just had a

633
00:42:15,575 --> 00:42:19,125
- sudden, searing pain.
- Hm.

634
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:21,046
Come on, doc. Level with me.

635
00:42:22,123 --> 00:42:24,091
Is all this really
gonna be worth it?

636
00:42:24,167 --> 00:42:26,920
Yeah, um-- well just

637
00:42:27,003 --> 00:42:29,973
- tell me where exactly...
- Ow!

638
00:42:30,048 --> 00:42:31,220
Sorry.

639
00:42:31,299 --> 00:42:32,972
(Marley sighing)

640
00:42:33,051 --> 00:42:37,056
Well, there was a pain in my ass,
but then I realized it was my mother.

641
00:42:37,138 --> 00:42:40,187
Marley, come on.
Just answer the question.

642
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:44,237
Is there a woman with a very big needle
standing next to me?

643
00:42:45,271 --> 00:42:49,276
Ow! That's my skin
you're pricking.

644
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:51,611
I'm sorry. I can't seem
to find a vein.

645
00:42:51,694 --> 00:42:53,162
Let me try.

646
00:43:06,459 --> 00:43:08,211
Dr. G?

647
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:11,798
I think I found one.

648
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:21,065
I don't know how it's doing
against my cancer,

649
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:24,440
but this treatment
sure is kicking my ass.

650
00:43:24,519 --> 00:43:26,521
Two down, eight to go.

651
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:29,323
Hey, Marley. Hey. Marley.

652
00:43:29,398 --> 00:43:31,821
- Hi.
- Hi.

653
00:43:31,901 --> 00:43:34,495
Hey, Marley.

654
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:40,168
There's, um, there's a fund raiser
on Saturday-- for patients.

655
00:43:40,243 --> 00:43:43,998
- Oh, nice.
- Yes, it's for patients, and...

656
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:48,961
Sorry. I'm just going to walk over there
where I can still eavesdrop.

657
00:43:50,128 --> 00:43:52,597
I wanted to see
if you wanted to come with me.

658
00:43:52,672 --> 00:43:56,552
Not come with me as a date,
or anything like that. No.

659
00:43:56,634 --> 00:44:00,605
It's semi-formal, so I don't know
if you like the idea of getting dressed.

660
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:03,399
I can't tell if you're trying
to talk me into it,

661
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:07,024
- or talk yourself out of it.
- A bit of both.

662
00:44:07,103 --> 00:44:12,280
- I'll see how I feel Saturday.
- Oh, good. Okay. Thank you.

663
00:44:12,358 --> 00:44:14,827
- Sorry. Thank you. Bye.
- Bye.

664
00:44:17,613 --> 00:44:22,744
Where, besides your life and General
Hospital, do doctors look like that?

665
00:44:22,827 --> 00:44:25,751
I mean- come on!

666
00:44:27,290 --> 00:44:30,260
<i>Hello, Marley. It's your father.</i>

667
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:33,759
<i>First of all, I don't appreciate
you hanging...</i>

668
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:44,732
Stanley met a really cute Shitszu today.
I think he had a crush.

669
00:44:46,851 --> 00:44:49,855
I'm not saying you should,
but if you let him mate,

670
00:44:49,937 --> 00:44:52,110
you'd probably start
a whole new breed:

671
00:44:53,149 --> 00:44:54,822
BullShits.

672
00:44:55,943 --> 00:44:58,037
BullShit Terriers.

673
00:45:02,241 --> 00:45:04,039
(Stanley whining)

674
00:45:05,494 --> 00:45:07,087
Okay.

675
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:12,502
Someone needs comfort food.

676
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:18,596
I'm gonna go home and fix you
a really nice Italian dish.

677
00:45:19,634 --> 00:45:22,262
So later on when your doorbell rings,

678
00:45:23,471 --> 00:45:26,270
you answer it. Okay?

679
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:27,892
Okay.

680
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,107
Beautiful.

681
00:45:38,486 --> 00:45:40,488
(Soft instrumental music)

682
00:46:10,726 --> 00:46:12,444
(doorbell ringing)

683
00:46:23,155 --> 00:46:24,532
You Marley?

684
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:26,583
- Yeah.
- I'm Vinnie.

685
00:46:28,119 --> 00:46:29,871
These are for you.

686
00:46:31,163 --> 00:46:33,416
Thank you. I-- whoa, whoa.

687
00:46:37,378 --> 00:46:39,927
- I love you.
- Bastard.

688
00:46:56,355 --> 00:46:57,607
Ah.

689
00:46:59,191 --> 00:47:02,286
How do you know Peter?

690
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:04,871
Who?

691
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:10,495
I got a call from work
to be here tonight.

692
00:47:12,163 --> 00:47:14,165
Especial Escorts.

693
00:47:23,007 --> 00:47:24,509
I'm really sorry.

694
00:47:24,592 --> 00:47:29,439
Well, you should know
that I definitely live up to my nickname:

695
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:31,607
Little Bit of Heaven.

696
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:34,982
Oh!
(Marley laughing)

697
00:47:36,645 --> 00:47:39,148
That is some offer, but, um,

698
00:47:40,274 --> 00:47:41,992
no.

699
00:47:51,118 --> 00:47:54,839
- Oh, don't forget your flowers.
- Nah, you keep them.

700
00:47:54,914 --> 00:47:58,214
Beautiful flowers
for a beautiful lady.

701
00:47:58,292 --> 00:47:59,464
Thank you.

702
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:04,674
Actually, I don't mean to sound rude,
but-- you don't look so good.

703
00:48:06,217 --> 00:48:09,812
I'm sick.
Probably dying.

704
00:48:09,887 --> 00:48:12,310
There isn't anything to be afraid of.

705
00:48:12,390 --> 00:48:16,065
I've died twice
and they brought me back both times.

706
00:48:16,143 --> 00:48:19,192
Really?
Did you see anything,

707
00:48:19,271 --> 00:48:22,901
like bright lights or anything?
Whoopi?

708
00:48:22,983 --> 00:48:24,860
No.

709
00:48:24,944 --> 00:48:28,164
It was, uh,
more like floating in water.

710
00:48:29,490 --> 00:48:30,787
It was real nice.

711
00:48:31,867 --> 00:48:34,290
I could have floated there forever.

712
00:48:35,788 --> 00:48:37,631
Nice to meet you, Marley.

713
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:40,501
Nice to meet you.

714
00:48:42,002 --> 00:48:43,549
(Door closing)

715
00:48:46,048 --> 00:48:47,140
Vinnie!

716
00:48:49,301 --> 00:48:51,929
Alright, I'm going all in.
You know why?

717
00:48:52,012 --> 00:48:54,856
Because I got the nuts.

718
00:48:54,932 --> 00:48:58,106
So you should probably fold,
or...

719
00:48:58,185 --> 00:49:00,028
What are you doing?

720
00:49:00,104 --> 00:49:02,027
Or I'm bluffing.

721
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:10,038
Fold.

722
00:49:10,114 --> 00:49:13,209
- Ohhh!
- Ohhh! Woo!

723
00:49:13,284 --> 00:49:15,127
- Okay. See?
- Oh, boy.

724
00:49:15,202 --> 00:49:18,001
- Smart.
- Full house, baby.

725
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:23,886
- Are you really single?
- I'm the cancer chick, remember?

726
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:27,636
Hardly qualifies me for being
somebody's dream girl.

727
00:49:27,715 --> 00:49:32,221
Why? Most of the great romances
in history end in death.

728
00:49:32,303 --> 00:49:36,183
Romeo and Juliet.
JFK and Jackie.

729
00:49:36,265 --> 00:49:38,643
- Siegfried and Roy.
- Um,

730
00:49:39,685 --> 00:49:41,562
Roy is not dead.

731
00:49:43,272 --> 00:49:45,320
Well, he didn't look too good.

732
00:49:46,525 --> 00:49:49,369
- I haven't found the right guy yet.
- Bullshit.

733
00:49:49,445 --> 00:49:51,743
Who wouldn't want a girl like you?

734
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:54,245
You are just afraid to let them in,

735
00:49:54,325 --> 00:49:58,000
because if you do and they reject you,
it hurts worse than death.

736
00:49:58,078 --> 00:50:00,581
(Marley laughing)
You're like

737
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:04,214
- Sigmund Freud all of a sudden?
-(German) Ja.

738
00:50:05,878 --> 00:50:09,758
Actually, a guy I like asked me out
this weekend. Sort of.

739
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,558
He said it wasn’t a date.

740
00:50:11,634 --> 00:50:13,432
- What time does it start?
- Five.

741
00:50:13,511 --> 00:50:15,013
- Dinner and a movie?
- Fund raiser.

742
00:50:15,095 --> 00:50:16,517
- Formal?
- Semi.

743
00:50:16,597 --> 00:50:18,565
- He's an idiot.
- I know. Right?

744
00:50:19,808 --> 00:50:23,438
Well, maybe he'll wise up
and treat it like a real date.

745
00:50:23,521 --> 00:50:24,989
If not, fuck him.

746
00:50:29,985 --> 00:50:32,408
Would you mind doing me a favour?

747
00:50:35,074 --> 00:50:37,327
(Marley): Oh, I like that.
(pounding sounds)

748
00:50:37,409 --> 00:50:39,628
(Vinnie): Yeah, a little bit of heaven?

749
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:41,250
- You want more heaven?
- Oh.

750
00:50:41,330 --> 00:50:45,051
You want a whole lot of heaven?
Oh!

751
00:50:45,125 --> 00:50:48,880
- (Marley): Ooh! Oh, my God, baby.
- Oh, my!

752
00:50:48,963 --> 00:50:52,388
Oh, my. Oh, my God.
Ohhh!

753
00:50:52,466 --> 00:50:54,935
Ohhh! Ohhh!

754
00:50:55,052 --> 00:50:56,850
(Breaking glass)

755
00:50:56,929 --> 00:51:00,650
(Vinnie): Ohhh!
Oh, that feels good.

756
00:51:00,724 --> 00:51:02,601
(Marley): Oh, oh.

757
00:51:02,685 --> 00:51:04,983
(Vinnie): Ow, the bottle. Ow, ow.

758
00:51:05,062 --> 00:51:07,690
- Oh.
- Woo!

759
00:51:07,773 --> 00:51:11,744
- Wow! Oh, my.
- Woo.

760
00:51:11,819 --> 00:51:13,947
Wow, Vinnie.

761
00:51:14,029 --> 00:51:15,781
- Oh.
- Marley.

762
00:51:17,241 --> 00:51:19,494
- Thank you, Vinnie.
- You're welcome.

763
00:51:19,577 --> 00:51:21,545
I had so much fun.

764
00:51:23,163 --> 00:51:25,131
(Vinnie laughing)

765
00:51:25,207 --> 00:51:28,962
See what happens
when you give a guy half a chance.

766
00:51:35,467 --> 00:51:38,767
You might be sore in the morning.

767
00:51:38,846 --> 00:51:41,565
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

768
00:51:43,892 --> 00:51:45,144
See ya.

769
00:51:50,524 --> 00:51:52,322
(Classical string music)

770
00:52:14,632 --> 00:52:19,103
- Is there a doctor in the house?
- <i>Que guapa que estás</i>.

771
00:52:19,178 --> 00:52:23,775
No clue what you just said,
but it sounds so good I don't care.

772
00:52:23,849 --> 00:52:26,068
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

773
00:52:26,143 --> 00:52:29,022
- No, for coming.
- I know.

774
00:52:29,104 --> 00:52:32,529
- Would you like to have a drink?
- Yeah.

775
00:52:33,651 --> 00:52:35,653
Okay. There.

776
00:52:38,238 --> 00:52:42,414
- I have a good one.
- Could you be more specific?

777
00:52:42,493 --> 00:52:46,669
- A joke.
- Oh, God, I created a monster.

778
00:52:46,747 --> 00:52:49,170
- You wanna listen to it?
- Yes, of course.

779
00:52:49,249 --> 00:52:54,756
Okay, um, okay.
Why does it suck being an egg?

780
00:52:56,215 --> 00:52:59,185
- I give up.
- Why does it suck being an egg?

781
00:52:59,259 --> 00:53:03,139
Because you only get laid once,
you only get eaten once,

782
00:53:03,222 --> 00:53:06,852
you take 10 minutes to get hard
and only 3 to get soft.

783
00:53:06,934 --> 00:53:10,689
And then you have to share this box
with 11 other guys.

784
00:53:10,771 --> 00:53:13,194
But the-- worst thing is...

785
00:53:14,316 --> 00:53:16,489
Oh, it's the funny part.

786
00:53:16,568 --> 00:53:19,037
(Marley laughing)

787
00:53:19,113 --> 00:53:21,787
You are the worst joke teller
I've ever met.

788
00:53:21,865 --> 00:53:24,084
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, that

789
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:27,413
the only person to ever
sit in your face is your mother.

790
00:53:27,496 --> 00:53:29,214
You're just hopeless.

791
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:35,839
- Ms. Corbett.
- Hi, Dr. Sanders.

792
00:53:39,717 --> 00:53:41,560
I'll grab an appetizer.

793
00:53:46,598 --> 00:53:48,976
- She's a brave girl.
- Yeah.

794
00:53:50,018 --> 00:53:52,316
You know she quit the trial.

795
00:53:53,814 --> 00:53:58,240
No, I-- I didn't know that.

796
00:54:01,363 --> 00:54:04,788
It seems to me that your patient's
having an easier time

797
00:54:04,867 --> 00:54:08,121
keeping emotion out of this decision
then you are.

798
00:54:08,203 --> 00:54:13,175
I'm just trying to save her life.
What else am I supposed to do?

799
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:15,423
Why did you invite her here?

800
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:20,053
Because there's patients, survivors.
It's a fund raiser for cancer.

801
00:54:20,132 --> 00:54:23,887
The line is there for a reason, Doctor.
Not just for the patients.

802
00:54:23,969 --> 00:54:26,643
You'll need to think about
what you're doing.

803
00:54:32,269 --> 00:54:33,566
- Hey, can I?
- Yes, sir.

804
00:54:33,645 --> 00:54:34,737
Thank you.

805
00:54:38,484 --> 00:54:40,236
What did I miss?

806
00:54:42,529 --> 00:54:46,625
- Do you wanna get out of here?
- Yeah, I know just the place.

807
00:54:47,826 --> 00:54:50,750
First dinner, then a surprise.

808
00:54:54,708 --> 00:54:56,085
Let's go.

809
00:54:56,710 --> 00:55:00,305
What-- a surprise in a dark alley?

810
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:04,760
- Do you really know where we're going?
- Yeah, I do.

811
00:55:04,843 --> 00:55:07,392
Where are you taking me?
Come on-

812
00:55:07,471 --> 00:55:09,974
In all the years you've been here,

813
00:55:10,057 --> 00:55:13,652
you've never been
to a little place called Paradise.

814
00:55:16,188 --> 00:55:18,236
Hey, hey.

815
00:55:18,315 --> 00:55:20,989
(Loud pop music, ambient sounds)

816
00:55:21,068 --> 00:55:24,789
Hey, Marley. Hey.

817
00:55:24,863 --> 00:55:28,959
- Hey. Wow.
- Don't worry, they don't bite

818
00:55:31,537 --> 00:55:32,789
much.

819
00:55:47,803 --> 00:55:49,225
Isn’t this fun?

820
00:55:49,304 --> 00:55:51,978
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Are you new in town?

821
00:55:58,689 --> 00:55:59,736
Hey.

822
00:56:05,571 --> 00:56:06,948
Marley.

823
00:56:10,075 --> 00:56:11,327
Hey.

824
00:56:22,838 --> 00:56:24,966
Hey, no, wait.

825
00:56:25,048 --> 00:56:26,800
No, wait, wait, wait.

826
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:34,566
You look amazing.

827
00:56:49,364 --> 00:56:51,162
(Marley and Julian laughing)

828
00:56:51,241 --> 00:56:53,915
You're such a tranny magnet.

829
00:56:53,994 --> 00:56:58,044
If I wasn't there, you could have
for sure gotten some action.

830
00:56:58,123 --> 00:57:02,344
I know.
Actually, you know that Adam?

831
00:57:02,419 --> 00:57:05,593
She was kind of hot, no?
Yeah.

832
00:57:06,632 --> 00:57:08,430
Ahhh.

833
00:57:11,929 --> 00:57:13,602
Where did you go?

834
00:57:17,601 --> 00:57:19,444
Do you believe in God?

835
00:57:21,521 --> 00:57:23,819
- Wow.
- No, really.

836
00:57:23,899 --> 00:57:28,325
Okay, if you ask me, Dr. Julian Goldstein,
if I believe in God...

837
00:57:28,403 --> 00:57:32,783
I mean, I believe in science
and in empirical evidence, so,

838
00:57:32,866 --> 00:57:36,541
no, I don't believe in a higher power.

839
00:57:36,620 --> 00:57:42,423
But if you ask me, Julian,
I'd say I don't know.

840
00:57:44,503 --> 00:57:45,846
Why?

841
00:57:47,798 --> 00:57:50,051
I envy people who do.

842
00:57:51,259 --> 00:57:54,308
They're so sure
that something exists.

843
00:57:55,389 --> 00:57:57,187
What a great way to live.

844
00:57:58,308 --> 00:57:59,981
Without fear.

845
00:58:03,063 --> 00:58:04,781
What are you afraid of?

846
00:58:08,527 --> 00:58:10,950
- No.
- Come on. Come on.

847
00:58:12,572 --> 00:58:13,949
I want to know.

848
00:58:15,283 --> 00:58:18,457
- The whole list?
- How about the top three?

849
00:58:18,537 --> 00:58:20,039
Fine.

850
00:58:20,122 --> 00:58:23,126
I'm afraid if I die
my Mom will never recover.

851
00:58:25,210 --> 00:58:26,382
Okay.

852
00:58:27,713 --> 00:58:30,341
I worry about who'd take care
of my dog.

853
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:36,138
Anything else?

854
00:58:36,221 --> 00:58:40,146
I'm scared this entire night
is gonna go by without you kissing me.

855
00:58:42,269 --> 00:58:44,021
(soft instrumental music)

856
00:58:50,902 --> 00:58:52,154
Ah.

857
00:59:44,581 --> 00:59:46,583
So this is a date, right?

858
00:59:48,126 --> 00:59:53,007
Yeah-- it's just that I--
they don't wanna...

859
00:59:58,261 --> 01:00:00,013
I quit the trial.

860
01:00:01,181 --> 01:00:02,307
I know.

861
01:00:03,350 --> 01:00:07,071
- Why?
- I want to enjoy quality of life.

862
01:00:08,105 --> 01:00:12,326
Besides, and you're gonna think
I'm crazy, but Whoopi Goldberg...

863
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:15,779
She is a lady who knows
what she's talking about

864
01:00:15,862 --> 01:00:18,331
No, you don't sound crazy at all.

865
01:00:18,406 --> 01:00:20,454
(Marley laughing)

866
01:00:20,534 --> 01:00:23,413
- You don't.
- Right.

867
01:00:23,495 --> 01:00:26,339
Coming from a guy
with a yo-yo collection.

868
01:00:26,414 --> 01:00:29,213
What?
You don't like yo-yos?

869
01:00:29,292 --> 01:00:31,636
You have a problem
against yo-yos?

870
01:00:32,671 --> 01:00:34,093
Well, let me show you.

871
01:00:36,758 --> 01:00:37,930
Okay.

872
01:00:40,595 --> 01:00:43,724
You really are the biggest dork
I've ever slept with.

873
01:00:43,807 --> 01:00:46,026
That's a very nice thing of you to say,

874
01:00:46,101 --> 01:00:50,322
but it's a far better compliment
if you leave dork out of that sentence.

875
01:00:50,397 --> 01:00:55,278
You are the biggest
I have ever slept with.

876
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:56,828
(Marley laughing)

877
01:00:58,697 --> 01:01:02,622
What a trick!
What a trick!

878
01:01:02,701 --> 01:01:04,078
(Upbeat music)

879
01:01:07,372 --> 01:01:09,716
Yeah, yeah, I know, but I...

880
01:01:12,335 --> 01:01:16,385

(Children laughing)

896
01:02:35,543 --> 01:02:39,423
- Hey, do not look over.
- Okay.

897
01:02:39,506 --> 01:02:42,476
Do you see those two guys
talking to Julian?

898
01:02:42,550 --> 01:02:44,598
Okay, look now.

899
01:02:46,346 --> 01:02:48,599
Stop. Stop looking.

900
01:02:48,682 --> 01:02:52,277
I'm having drinks
with Clark Kent tonight.

901
01:02:52,352 --> 01:02:55,276
And dinner with Superman tomorrow.

902
01:02:55,355 --> 01:02:59,861
Oh boy, you have taken my whore crown
and are wearing it so well.

903
01:02:59,943 --> 01:03:03,197
It's a little big.
I've been wearing it as a belt.

904
01:03:05,156 --> 01:03:06,203
Ahh!

905
01:03:07,867 --> 01:03:12,623
You know, actually, Renee's life
is looking pretty good to me lately.

906
01:03:17,919 --> 01:03:19,762
Marley, I...

907
01:03:22,257 --> 01:03:25,932
I'm sorry, Marley, I don't know.
I just-- I'm sorry.

908
01:03:26,011 --> 01:03:27,638
Sssh. it's okay.

909
01:03:30,015 --> 01:03:31,892
(Soft instrumental music)

910
01:04:16,728 --> 01:04:19,777
Oh, that's sweet, isn't it?

911
01:04:19,856 --> 01:04:22,575
Let's put it right in here
with your name on it.

912
01:04:22,692 --> 01:04:27,118
What do you think Martha Stewart
would think of my arrangement, Stanley?

913
01:04:27,197 --> 01:04:28,540
Okay.

914
01:04:28,615 --> 01:04:33,746
Maybe I could quit planning parties
and do my own flower arrangements.

915
01:04:33,828 --> 01:04:35,501
(door closing)

916
01:04:36,748 --> 01:04:38,546
You're home early.

917
01:04:38,625 --> 01:04:41,799
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah, it's fine.

918
01:04:43,296 --> 01:04:46,391
- Did something happen?
- I'm going back to bed.

919
01:04:46,466 --> 01:04:48,844
Did you and Julian have a fight?

920
01:04:50,970 --> 01:04:52,313
No.

921
01:04:52,389 --> 01:04:55,893
Do you want to talk about it?
Maybe I could help.

922
01:04:55,975 --> 01:04:59,229
Right. 'Cause you're the expert
in relationships.

923
01:05:00,855 --> 01:05:02,857
(Door closing)

924
01:05:08,905 --> 01:05:12,159
Mom, please, not now-

925
01:05:12,242 --> 01:05:15,337
I may have made a mistake
marrying your father.

926
01:05:15,412 --> 01:05:19,258
May have?
The man is emotionally constipated.

927
01:05:19,332 --> 01:05:22,176
I'm grateful he gave me you.

928
01:05:26,131 --> 01:05:27,883
(Door closing)

929
01:05:31,636 --> 01:05:32,933
(monkey sounds)

930
01:05:35,265 --> 01:05:38,189
(imitating monkeys)

931
01:05:40,437 --> 01:05:41,984
(laughing)

932
01:05:44,065 --> 01:05:46,159
Oh, my goodness.

933
01:05:47,193 --> 01:05:49,446
Can I have a big hug?
Oh.

934
01:05:50,488 --> 01:05:52,035
Mmm.

935
01:05:54,242 --> 01:05:57,621
- Hey.
- Did she tell you?

936
01:05:57,704 --> 01:05:59,957
God, my mother is a walking mouth.

937
01:06:00,039 --> 01:06:03,760
- A walking mouth.
- Hello, Cammie.

938
01:06:03,835 --> 01:06:06,759
- You look very pretty today.
- What do you tell him?

939
01:06:06,838 --> 01:06:11,514
- And I'm smart.
- Good girl. Good girl.

940
01:06:11,593 --> 01:06:13,095
(Water sounds)
Oooh!

941
01:06:14,387 --> 01:06:18,688
Oh grody, he's peeing!

942
01:06:21,478 --> 01:06:23,697
So what was this morning about?

943
01:06:24,731 --> 01:06:28,235
- I don't know. I couldn't sleep.
- I know.

944
01:06:28,318 --> 01:06:32,539
- But why?
- Well, a reminder: I'm dying.

945
01:06:34,115 --> 01:06:38,541
Yeah okay, and I haven't helped you,
um,

946
01:06:38,620 --> 01:06:41,339
get in touch with all the--
the anger and...

947
01:06:41,414 --> 01:06:42,916
You know what? Just stop.

948
01:06:42,999 --> 01:06:46,549
I'm so not in the mood
for a lecture right now.

949
01:06:46,628 --> 01:06:50,178
Hey! it's obvious that you're scared.
It's normal. it's fine.

950
01:06:50,256 --> 01:06:53,931
Is it normal for doctors
to screw their patients?

951
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:57,765
We had a good time.
Let's just leave it at that.

952
01:06:57,847 --> 01:06:59,690
Wow!

953
01:06:59,766 --> 01:07:03,066
- Whoa, already past tense.
- Well,

954
01:07:04,103 --> 01:07:08,199
reality check: It's going to be
past tense soon enough.

955
01:07:09,901 --> 01:07:13,155
- Hey, Marley...
- Mmm.

956
01:07:14,906 --> 01:07:16,954
I love you.

957
01:07:23,957 --> 01:07:25,959
Oh, great.

958
01:07:27,835 --> 01:07:29,462
Fantastic.

959
01:07:31,089 --> 01:07:32,807
You love me.

960
01:07:34,259 --> 01:07:38,059
What kind of guy
falls in love with a dying girl?

961
01:07:38,137 --> 01:07:41,311
Don't diminish what's going on
between us. Okay?

962
01:07:41,391 --> 01:07:43,485
- I know what I'm feeling.
- I do too.

963
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:46,564
I feel smothered
and I need you to back off!

964
01:07:46,646 --> 01:07:47,693
No, no...

965
01:07:47,772 --> 01:07:50,992
- Ow!
- Are you okay?

966
01:07:51,067 --> 01:07:53,820
Leave me alone!

967
01:07:55,405 --> 01:07:59,330
- Come on, let me help you.
- I said: Leave me the hell alone!

968
01:08:02,328 --> 01:08:05,252
- I'm sorry, sweetie.
- I wanna go home.

969
01:08:05,331 --> 01:08:07,925
I know.
I'm gonna take you home right now.

970
01:08:09,252 --> 01:08:10,845
I'm sorry.

971
01:08:15,258 --> 01:08:17,886
Let me see.
Let me see that beautiful face.

972
01:08:19,679 --> 01:08:22,603
- Let me see...
-(Renee): Hey, you're back early.

973
01:08:24,475 --> 01:08:27,945
- Hi, Mommy.
- Hi, pumpkin. Did you all have fun?

974
01:08:28,021 --> 01:08:29,898
- You're having a party.
- No.

975
01:08:29,981 --> 01:08:34,737
Some of the other moms dropped by.
Sort of an impromptu thing.

976
01:08:34,819 --> 01:08:36,787
It's not contagious, you know.

977
01:08:37,822 --> 01:08:39,244
Of course not.

978
01:08:40,283 --> 01:08:44,754
Um-- why don't you go back
and play for a little bit.

979
01:08:44,829 --> 01:08:48,584
- Bye, sweetie, I love you.
- Bye.

980
01:08:48,666 --> 01:08:52,296
I've just been really busy, you know.
With the baby coming and...

981
01:08:52,378 --> 01:08:56,383
Oh, really? You obviously have time
for those women in there.

982
01:08:56,466 --> 01:09:02,690
- That's different. They're...
- What? They're fat, boring and

983
01:09:03,806 --> 01:09:07,310
- not dying?
- Okay.

984
01:09:07,393 --> 01:09:09,612
Want me to make this
more palatable for you?

985
01:09:09,687 --> 01:09:11,564
- That's not what I want.
- Are you just

986
01:09:11,648 --> 01:09:15,027
angry because you're going
to have to fnd a new babysitter?

987
01:09:17,445 --> 01:09:18,788
Yeah.

988
01:09:20,114 --> 01:09:23,789
Come on.
That's exactly what I'm angry about.

989
01:09:28,039 --> 01:09:30,258
(door slamming)

990
01:09:35,296 --> 01:09:37,845
(Peter): They could fire you
on the first day.

991
01:09:37,924 --> 01:09:39,676
(Matt): Oh, yeah?

992
01:09:39,759 --> 01:09:46,062
- Hey, the zoo, how was it?
- Oh, you know. It was fantastic.

993
01:09:46,140 --> 01:09:51,613
Um, Marley, this is Matt. My friend
who moved here from Brooklyn.

994
01:09:51,688 --> 01:09:54,737
Nice to meet you.
Peter's told me a lot about you.

995
01:09:54,816 --> 01:09:56,238
Really?

996
01:09:56,317 --> 01:09:59,571
- Did he tell you I was dying?
- Yeah.

997
01:09:59,654 --> 01:10:02,783
A couple more weeks
and I'm out of here.

998
01:10:02,865 --> 01:10:05,243
Why don't you take a look
at my apartment.

999
01:10:05,326 --> 01:10:08,751
Then maybe you guys
can be neighbours and love buddies.

1000
01:10:08,830 --> 01:10:11,879
Excuse me.
Babe.

1001
01:10:12,917 --> 01:10:15,796
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

1002
01:10:15,878 --> 01:10:17,551
Have a good day.

1003
01:10:20,299 --> 01:10:22,222

Of what?

1018
01:11:40,963 --> 01:11:45,059
- Of dying.
- Everybody dies.

1019
01:11:45,134 --> 01:11:47,182
What are you really afraid of?

1020
01:11:47,261 --> 01:11:51,437
I didn't have enough time
to do all the things I wanted to do.

- Buy a house!

Have a baby.
Find somebody who loves me.

1023
01:11:58,064 --> 01:12:01,614
You have that.
Or, you had it.

1024
01:12:01,692 --> 01:12:03,319
How do you know?

1025
01:12:03,402 --> 01:12:07,157
He could just have said all that stuff
because he felt sorry for me.

1026
01:12:07,240 --> 01:12:11,120
He doesn't strike me as someone
who loved you out of pity.

1027
01:12:11,202 --> 01:12:13,125
You should try again.

1028
01:12:13,204 --> 01:12:17,675
- I don't know what his issues are.
- I don't care what his issues are.

1029
01:12:17,750 --> 01:12:21,471
- Do you love him?
- Um...

1030
01:12:21,546 --> 01:12:25,141
Do you love him?

1031
01:12:25,216 --> 01:12:27,560
- Do you?
- I do, I do, I do.

1032
01:12:27,635 --> 01:12:31,265
- Say it in a complete sentence.
- I love him. I love him.

1033
01:12:31,347 --> 01:12:34,567
I-- love him.

1034
01:12:34,642 --> 01:12:36,770
I really do.
I really love him.

1035
01:12:36,853 --> 01:12:39,948
Maybe you should go back down
and tell him.

1036
01:12:40,022 --> 01:12:43,697
- I can't go back down. I'm dead.
- You're not dead.

1037
01:12:43,776 --> 01:12:45,619
The car didn't actually hit you.

1038
01:12:45,695 --> 01:12:49,416
Aside from a little headache,
you should be fine.

1039
01:12:53,369 --> 01:12:56,464
(Car horn honking,

01:13:01,002 --> 01:13:02,219
Ohh!

1043
01:13:04,171 --> 01:13:05,388
Ohh.

(Church bell ringing)

1045
01:13:16,475 --> 01:13:18,193
Oh look, he's right here.

1046
01:13:21,439 --> 01:13:26,240
- Mom? Hey.
- Right. Okay. I'll wait for you outside.

1047
01:13:26,319 --> 01:13:27,662
Thank you.

1048
01:13:32,575 --> 01:13:35,044
-(Marley): Hi.
-(Julian): Hi.

1049
01:13:36,162 --> 01:13:39,712
- What happened to you?
- A street hit me in the face.

1050
01:13:41,292 --> 01:13:43,636
- What?
- Can I talk to you?

1051
01:13:43,711 --> 01:13:46,681
- Yeah.
- Okay. Come on.

1052
01:13:51,093 --> 01:13:53,892
My whole life I've been so afraid
of guys lying to me,

1053
01:13:53,971 --> 01:13:57,145
not being there for me
and ending up shafted like my mother.

1054
01:13:57,224 --> 01:14:00,694
Somewhere along the line
I decided to take charge of my life,

1055
01:14:00,770 --> 01:14:04,616
and to never let anybody
ever get close enough to hurt me.

1056
01:14:04,690 --> 01:14:06,909
- Ever.
- Okay. Okay.

1057
01:14:09,195 --> 01:14:10,868
And then you come along.

1058
01:14:10,947 --> 01:14:14,076
With your nose in your books
and your yo-yos and your

1059
01:14:14,158 --> 01:14:19,380
spouting off ridiculous jokes like:
"My Mom sat on my-- face."

1060
01:14:21,374 --> 01:14:24,298
- So you can see how I missed it.
- What?

1061
01:14:24,377 --> 01:14:25,924
What? You missed what?

1062
01:14:30,591 --> 01:14:32,559
(Instrumental music)

1063
01:14:42,269 --> 01:14:44,146
You're my third wish.

1064
01:14:46,649 --> 01:14:47,992
I love you.

1065
01:15:01,038 --> 01:15:05,635
Put your turn signal on. Don't make me
guess which way you're gonna go.

1066
01:15:05,710 --> 01:15:08,213
(Beverley): Just surprise me.

1067
01:15:08,295 --> 01:15:12,266
Remember when I was little how I
used to masturbate all the time?

1068
01:15:13,300 --> 01:15:15,974
Do you remember when we went
to that rug store

1069
01:15:16,053 --> 01:15:18,647
and I hopped up
on one of those rolled-up rugs?

1070
01:15:19,932 --> 01:15:22,651
Then you gave me
a two-week time out

1071
01:15:22,727 --> 01:15:26,527
and told me never to touch
my jingle bells again.

1072
01:15:28,858 --> 01:15:31,611
Yeah, I remember that.

1073
01:15:36,115 --> 01:15:37,537
You know?

1074
01:15:40,453 --> 01:15:44,208
My whole life I think that was
the only time you were a bad Mom.

1075
01:15:47,418 --> 01:15:49,841
Yet I was such a shit.

1076
01:15:50,087 --> 01:15:51,714
You're a daughter.

1077
01:15:53,007 --> 01:15:54,805
That's your job.

1078
01:16:00,890 --> 01:16:03,313
Will you help me plan my funeral?

1079
01:16:06,103 --> 01:16:07,275
Sure.

1080
01:16:08,314 --> 01:16:12,194
I don't want it to be some sombre affair.
I want it to be a celebration.

1081
01:16:12,276 --> 01:16:13,573
I want to put the

1082
01:16:14,612 --> 01:16:17,206
f-u-n back in funeral.

1083
01:16:23,037 --> 01:16:24,835
(Soft instrumental music)

1084
01:16:38,969 --> 01:16:40,346
Hi.

1085
01:16:40,429 --> 01:16:44,229
Listen, you've been a real bitch lately.
Really mean and ugly.

1086
01:16:44,308 --> 01:16:46,982
I just want you to know
that I don't appreciate it.

1087
01:16:47,061 --> 01:16:48,483
- You don't?
- No.

1088
01:16:48,562 --> 01:16:51,816
Because I've done nothing
but support you

1089
01:16:51,899 --> 01:16:55,824
- through this so-called difficult time.
- Well, it has been hard.

1090
01:16:55,903 --> 01:17:00,784
Please-- listening to you
going on and on about

1091
01:17:00,866 --> 01:17:03,870
feeling sick and "I'm too tired"

1092
01:17:03,953 --> 01:17:08,584
and "Oh, that Vinnie
really rocked my world."

1093
01:17:08,666 --> 01:17:10,839
- He was awesome wasn't he?
- He was.

1094
01:17:10,918 --> 01:17:12,716
- So back to you.
- What?

1095
01:17:12,795 --> 01:17:15,639
Your behaviour has really
made me angry. It has.

1096
01:17:15,714 --> 01:17:18,888
But you wanna know what makes me
blow my top, see red

1097
01:17:18,968 --> 01:17:24,441
and makes my blood boil
is the fact that I'm gonna miss you.

1098
01:17:26,934 --> 01:17:28,481
So much.

1099
01:17:38,445 --> 01:17:40,197
(Marley sighing)

1100
01:17:40,281 --> 01:17:44,286
Do you think I could have
that dance now?

1101
01:17:46,120 --> 01:17:47,246
No.

1102
01:17:48,873 --> 01:17:51,717
That ship sailed so long ago.

1103
01:17:57,131 --> 01:18:00,476
You know?
I thought you'd never ask.

1104
01:18:03,345 --> 01:18:05,598
(soft instrumental music)

1105
01:18:21,530 --> 01:18:23,749
(salsa music)

1106
01:18:28,495 --> 01:18:30,589
You're just scared.

1107
01:18:30,664 --> 01:18:34,294
- Break it down.
- Take all that. Aw. Take that.

1108
01:18:34,376 --> 01:18:38,131
Woof. Woof.
I mean it's so high.

1109
01:18:38,214 --> 01:18:41,263
(Spanish football game on TV,
phone ringing)

1110
01:18:45,804 --> 01:18:49,024
(answering machine turning on)
<i>Hi, Marley it's Dad.</i>

1111
01:18:49,099 --> 01:18:52,979
<i>I'm coming into town tonight
and I'd like to see you.</i>

1112
01:18:53,062 --> 01:18:56,282
<i>I'll call you once I get to the hotel.</i>

1113
01:18:56,357 --> 01:18:59,201
<i>Hope you're doing well.
Bye.</i>

1114
01:19:00,986 --> 01:19:03,705
He sounds like he's making an effort.

1115
01:19:06,325 --> 01:19:09,625
It's too little too late.

1116
01:19:12,957 --> 01:19:14,379
Mmm.

1117
01:19:18,212 --> 01:19:19,555
Go ahead.

1118
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:24,309
You know, I don't know the guy,

1119
01:19:24,385 --> 01:19:27,639
and he might be as big a schmuck
as you say he is,

1120
01:19:27,721 --> 01:19:30,895
but, um, it might worth
listening to him.

1121
01:19:32,977 --> 01:19:36,607
Some people have a hard time
opening up about their feelings.

1122
01:19:39,608 --> 01:19:41,155
Low blow.

1123
01:19:53,289 --> 01:19:54,666
(TV announcer): Goal!

1124
01:19:57,001 --> 01:19:59,379
The Penne Arrabiata sounds good.

1125
01:19:59,461 --> 01:20:03,056
Oh thanks, but I'm trying to lose
a couple of pounds.

1126
01:20:04,508 --> 01:20:05,600
(Ambient sounds)

1127
01:20:09,471 --> 01:20:13,271
- What are we doing?
- What do you mean?

1128
01:20:13,350 --> 01:20:17,571
Making chit-chat like nothing's wrong
between us. I hate it.

1129
01:20:17,646 --> 01:20:21,025
- I'm trying to have a nice visit.
- By not saying anything?

1130
01:20:21,108 --> 01:20:24,829
- What do you want me to do?
- Nothing. It's fine.

1131
01:20:24,945 --> 01:20:29,325
- No. I'm here aren't I?
- Yes, Dad, physically you are here.

1132
01:20:29,408 --> 01:20:32,662
- Marley, come on. I'm trying.
- Give the man a trophy.

1133
01:20:32,745 --> 01:20:33,997
He's trying.

1134
01:20:34,079 --> 01:20:38,835
Could we have just one pleasant meal?
Just one and then talk about this later?

1135
01:20:40,836 --> 01:20:42,679
- Fine.
- Thank you.

1136
01:20:46,717 --> 01:20:49,937
No. it's not fine.
I don't know if I have a "later".

1137
01:20:50,012 --> 01:20:53,437
So we need to talk about this right now,
or I walk out the door

1138
01:20:53,515 --> 01:20:55,643
and may never see you again.

1139
01:21:27,841 --> 01:21:29,388
Marley, wait!

1140
01:21:31,970 --> 01:21:34,894
I don't know what to do, kiddo.
Tell me what to do.

1141
01:21:34,973 --> 01:21:37,192
Dad, I don't want to have to tell you.

1142
01:21:37,267 --> 01:21:40,396
And I shouldn't have to tell you.

1143
01:21:41,438 --> 01:21:44,567
Do you remember that time
probably 20 years ago?

1144
01:21:44,650 --> 01:21:47,620
You said: "I'm glad
God brought me into this world,

1145
01:21:47,694 --> 01:21:50,413
but I wish it was
from a different father."

1146
01:21:50,489 --> 01:21:52,787
Do you remember that?

1147
01:21:52,866 --> 01:21:56,587
And yet I said nothing,
because I didn't know what to say.

1148
01:21:57,746 --> 01:21:59,714
But it killed me inside.

1149
01:22:00,833 --> 01:22:04,838
And now my little girl is very sick
and I can't fix it.

1150
01:22:06,463 --> 01:22:08,181
So please tell me what to say,

1151
01:22:08,257 --> 01:22:11,352
because I can't have you
hating me like this any more.

1152
01:22:12,511 --> 01:22:15,731
I love you so very much, Marley.

1153
01:22:17,391 --> 01:22:19,519
Just tell me what to do.

1154
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:23,693
You just did it.

1155
01:22:24,898 --> 01:22:26,616
(Soft piano music)

1156
01:22:32,322 --> 01:22:33,824
Thank you.

1157
01:22:42,040 --> 01:22:43,667
(Marley): Renee?

1158
01:22:47,129 --> 01:22:48,972
Renee!

1159
01:23:00,309 --> 01:23:03,779
I know you're in here, so I'm just
gonna say what I came here to say,

1160
01:23:03,854 --> 01:23:05,902
which is: I'm sorry.

1161
01:23:05,981 --> 01:23:11,112
It really hurt when you started
distancing yourself, but it's okay.

1162
01:23:11,195 --> 01:23:12,913
I get it.

1163
01:23:12,988 --> 01:23:17,915
A new baby coming
and me-- leaving.

1164
01:23:17,993 --> 01:23:24,797
It's not fair having to be so happy
and so sad at the same time, is it?

1165
01:23:27,878 --> 01:23:31,257
Our friendship is one of the best things
in my life.

1166
01:23:31,340 --> 01:23:34,935
I'm sorry I'm not gonna get
to know that little boy.

1167
01:23:35,010 --> 01:23:38,765
But I know he'll be beautiful.
Just like Cammie.

1168
01:23:38,847 --> 01:23:40,599
(Renee sobbing)

1169
01:23:40,682 --> 01:23:44,528
Oh, my God, that little girl is amazing.

1170
01:23:48,440 --> 01:23:50,238
So, please, when she gets older

1171
01:23:50,317 --> 01:23:53,617
tell her that I loved her
like she was my own.

1172
01:24:04,748 --> 01:24:06,295
Bye.

1173
01:24:16,927 --> 01:24:18,895
(Soft instrumental music)

1174
01:24:31,066 --> 01:24:33,569
You sure you still want to do this?

1175
01:24:35,904 --> 01:24:37,076
Yeah.

1176
01:24:38,115 --> 01:24:39,867

Hey, what are you gonna do
after I'm gone?

1198
01:26:19,174 --> 01:26:20,517
Hum?

1199
01:26:22,386 --> 01:26:26,061
Come on. You got on my case
about not opening up.

1200
01:26:29,518 --> 01:26:32,943
I just don't like thinking about it.

1201
01:26:33,021 --> 01:26:36,946
Julian, I need to know
that you're gonna be okay.

1202
01:26:37,025 --> 01:26:38,072
Oh, my God.

1203
01:26:38,151 --> 01:26:40,449
We should talk about
what we're feeling.

1204
01:26:40,529 --> 01:26:45,376
- Now I've created a monster.
- Yeah, you have.

1205
01:26:48,036 --> 01:26:49,504
So?

1206
01:26:54,918 --> 01:26:55,965
Um,

1207
01:26:57,254 --> 01:27:02,431
so-- this old man
he goes to the doctor,

1208
01:27:02,509 --> 01:27:04,682
and he brings his wife along.

1209
01:27:04,761 --> 01:27:07,685
It's the yearly physical,
so the doctor says:

1210
01:27:07,764 --> 01:27:12,315
"I just need a urine sample,
a blood, a sperm and a stool sample."

1211
01:27:12,394 --> 01:27:16,695
The old man can't hear very well,
so he looks over to his wife

1212
01:27:16,773 --> 01:27:20,403
and asks: "What?
What is he saying?"

1213
01:27:20,485 --> 01:27:24,240
And the wife yells back at him:
"He wants your underwear!"

1214
01:27:29,828 --> 01:27:32,206
My work here is done.

1215
01:27:35,125 --> 01:27:38,254
(Sound of rain drops falling)

1216
01:27:46,136 --> 01:27:49,265

1217
01:28:05,322 --> 01:28:07,950
(Marley gasping)
Ohh.

1218
01:28:17,542 --> 01:28:18,964
Oh.

1219
01:28:31,723 --> 01:28:33,976
(Soft instrumental music)

1220
01:29:07,092 --> 01:29:10,471
So, I have to go back
to New York for a few days, but

1221
01:29:10,554 --> 01:29:12,477
call me if you need anything. Okay?

1222
01:29:12,556 --> 01:29:14,604
Okay, I will.

1223
01:29:15,809 --> 01:29:18,608
- I love you.
- I love you too.

1224
01:29:19,646 --> 01:29:21,148
Bye.

1225
01:29:27,654 --> 01:29:31,079
And this includes
a big opening party?

1226
01:29:32,450 --> 01:29:36,455
Alright, that's what I want.
Great.

1227
01:29:37,747 --> 01:29:39,841
The name is Sarah Walker.

1228
01:29:41,126 --> 01:29:42,594
It's a surprise.

1229
01:29:43,628 --> 01:29:47,178
(Marley): Okay, thank you very much.
Bye, bye.

1230
01:29:53,054 --> 01:29:57,605
Mom, would you do me a favour
and give this to Sarah for me?

1231
01:29:58,935 --> 01:30:02,314
She's gonna be here in a minute.
You can...

1232
01:30:04,065 --> 01:30:05,237
Oh.

1233
01:30:08,612 --> 01:30:10,831
I'll make sure she gets it.

1234
01:30:15,410 --> 01:30:18,380
And this is for you.

1235
01:30:27,213 --> 01:30:29,136
- It's for me?
- Hm.

1236
01:30:42,938 --> 01:30:44,406
(Beverley crying)

1237
01:30:50,403 --> 01:30:51,746
Mom?

1238
01:30:53,073 --> 01:30:54,416
Yeah?

1239
01:30:54,491 --> 01:30:56,835
Will you take care of Stanley for me?

1240
01:30:58,119 --> 01:31:01,999
- I wouldn't have it any other way.
- Check.

1241
01:31:05,251 --> 01:31:06,548
Ah.

1242
01:31:10,423 --> 01:31:11,800
Ah.

Go get it.

Get it, buddy.

01:32:02,225 --> 01:32:03,977
Hey.

1253
01:32:04,060 --> 01:32:09,317
I was gonna go for a jog up the hill.
Do you want to come?

1254
01:32:09,399 --> 01:32:14,576
- Sure. You start. I'll catch right up.
- Okay.

1255
01:32:16,531 --> 01:32:22,834
Woo! Yeah. Here we go.
Oh, Oh.

1256
01:32:24,497 --> 01:32:26,750
On second thought,
that's a really big hill.

1257
01:32:27,792 --> 01:32:29,465
Pussy.

1258
01:32:30,670 --> 01:32:32,593
I'm not afraid to admit it.

1259
01:32:35,091 --> 01:32:36,684
Ah.

1260
01:32:40,764 --> 01:32:43,608
When's Julian getting here?

1261
01:32:43,683 --> 01:32:46,653
He had to work late,
so I just left a message.

- Sarah?
- Hm?

1264
01:32:59,157 --> 01:33:00,625
I'm sorry.

1265
01:33:01,493 --> 01:33:04,121
- What?
- I've been so wrapped up in all this,

1266
01:33:04,204 --> 01:33:08,459
I haven't stopped to ask how
it was affecting all of you guys.

1267
01:33:08,541 --> 01:33:11,135
- Oh, that's...
- Ask how you're doing.

1268
01:33:11,211 --> 01:33:14,511
- It's....
- How are you're doing?

1269
01:33:21,054 --> 01:33:23,398
How are you doing?

1270
01:33:25,934 --> 01:33:27,527
Not so good.

1271
01:33:29,020 --> 01:33:32,365
See?
I didn't know that.

1272
01:33:32,440 --> 01:33:36,035
Why didn't you wish
not to die, huh?

1273
01:33:37,445 --> 01:33:39,994
Hm, something else I wanted more.

1274
01:33:40,073 --> 01:33:45,830
Well, I wish it.
I wish it right now. God?

1275
01:33:45,912 --> 01:33:50,793
Hey? God?
You listening?

1276
01:33:52,544 --> 01:33:55,889
You can't take her away.
Okay?

1277
01:33:57,465 --> 01:33:59,888
I want her to stay here.

1278
01:34:01,386 --> 01:34:06,017
It's not gonna work. You need
an anal probe and a morphine shooter.

1279
01:34:14,566 --> 01:34:18,116
- Are you scared?
- No.

1280

Marley?

1285
01:35:11,456 --> 01:35:12,958
Hey.

1286

this was going to be so difficult.</i>

1297

I do.<i>

1300

<i>That's not even
giving you enough credit,</i>

1301
01:37:18,708 --> 01:37:22,508
<i>because until I met you
I had no idea who I could be.</i>

not to fall in love again. Ever.</i>

<i>Ever again.</i>

<i>That's kind of a joke.</i>

- I love you.
- I love you.

I know.

(Instrumental music)

1310
01:38:35,034 --> 01:38:38,504
(voice over Marley)
So, that's my story.

1311
01:38:38,579 --> 01:38:41,924
I had some pretty amazing
friends, didn't I?

1312
01:38:41,999 --> 01:38:46,379
And I include my parents in that group,
even though my whole life I blamed them

1313
01:38:46,462 --> 01:38:48,931
for, well, everything.

1314
01:38:49,006 --> 01:38:54,809
But the truth is: I was afraid.
I was afraid to trust and forgive.

1315
01:38:54,887 --> 01:38:58,687
I was scared I wasn’t enough.
But I was.

- Thank you, Marley.

What I wouldn't give

1324
01:40:31,442 --> 01:40:36,664
to experience just one more time,
to feel that incredible sensation

1325
01:40:38,366 --> 01:40:42,997
when he looked at me
and I felt-- alive.
