{736}{839}Gangland enforcers broke the arms of|an elderly news dealer this afternoon...
{841}{915}when he refused to share|his week´s receipts with them.
{917}{973}Stacks of newspapers|were tossed in the gutter...
{975}{1069}as the thugs wrecked the business|and made their getaway.
{1071}{1169}Lunchtime crowds were paralysed|by the suddenness of the crime.
{1171}{1232}Not a hand was raised in protest!
{1343}{1402}Organized crime is their name.
{1404}{1475}What appeared to be organized hoods|shattered the kneecaps...
{1477}{1538}of the beloved operator|of a shoeshine parlour today...
{1540}{1592}as horrified customers looked on.

{1644}{1712}and paid dearly for his failure|to surrender to gang demands.
{1714}{1798}A mother of four, unable to pay|a gambling debt, lies dead tonight.

{1859}{1925}as they helped themselves|to the contents of a cash register...
{1927}{1985}inside the luncheonette.

{6518}{6569}- Everything all right, Tracy?|- Fine, fine.

{7174}{7271}They believe in you, Tracy.|They think if you´re Chief of Police,|this city´ll be safe.
{7273}{7380}Tess, there´s about as much chance of me|gettin´ behind a desk as there is of me|gettin´ a new girlfriend.
{7382}{7494}Sooner or later|you´re gonna decide

{30738}{30836}Or maybe you weren´t on his side.|Whose side are you on?
{30838}{30937}The side I´m always on.|Mine.
{30939}{31044}- No grief for Lips?|- I´m wearing black underwear.
{31142}{31231}You know, it´s legal for me|to take you down to the station and|sweat it out of you under the lights.
{31233}{31314}I sweat a lot better in the dark.
{31401}{31499}I know how you feel. You don´t know|if you wanna hit me or kiss me.
{31501}{31571}- I get a lot of that.|- Look, you´re safe.
{31573}{31676}Big Boy´s in jail. You´re the one|that can keep him there. Give me a call.
{32043}{32098}You can do a little two-step
{32100}{32164}I´ll go anywhere that you step to
{32166}{32237}´Cause now I´m followin´you
{32271}{32326}My feet
{32328}{32403}Might be fallin´out of rhythm
{32405}{32483}- Don´t know what I´m doin´ with ´em--|- My gosh. What time is it?
{32485}{32566}- It´s 6:30.|- I have to get to the greenhouse.
{32568}{32638}- I´ve got those new delphiniums|coming in.|- Oh.
{32640}{32699}Pat says he´s gonna|call the orphanage today.
{32701}{32769}- Tracy, you might try watering those.|- Tess.
{32771}{32846}- Mm-hmm?|- Thanks for watchin´ the kid.
{32848}{32907}- Night, Tracy.|- Uh, Tess.
{32943}{33012}You know, you´re one in a million.
{33014}{33080}Romance him if he begs you to
{33082}{33162}Now I´m followin´you
{33226}{33299}Oh, Tracy, good night.
{33301}{33376}Oh, by the way, Tracy,|have a good sleep.
{33378}{33430}Rompin´|Rompin´stompin´
{33432}{33496}I´m rompin´|Rompin´stompin´
{33498}{33617}I´m rompin´|Rompin´stompin´all day
{33904}{33959}- You tried the iodine transfer?|- Yes, Tracy.
{33961}{34002}- And the silver nitrate?|- Twice.
{34004}{34062}Big Boy Caprice´s fingerprints|are not on those walnuts, Tracy.
{34064}{34119}Well, I had to take the gamble.|What is it, Sam?
{34121}{34173}Tess is waiting, boy´s department,|Marshall and Bradbury.
{34175}{34305}She says she´s not gonna|go for a drive in the country|with that kid if he´s wearing|the clothes he has on. They stink.
{34307}{34410}Police brutality, boys.|And this is the fifth time.
{34412}{34459}Lucky for me I don´t bruise easily.
{34461}{34539}Mr Caprice, do you intend|to take legal action against the city|for false arrest?
{34541}{34605}Why should I blame the city|for something one man is doing?
{34607}{34668}This Tracy character´s unstable.|The city should get rid of him.
{34670}{34737}- You mean,|if you don´t get rid of him first.|- Who said that?
{34769}{34829}Hey, there´s Fletcher!
{34831}{34917}´´Law without order is as great a danger|to the people as order without law.´´
{34919}{34959}Jefferson.
{34961}{35026}How can I support|a maverick police detective...
{35028}{35132}who keeps making false arrests|of private citizens|and throwing them in jail?
{35134}{35186}- Tracy, I am district attorney--|- Tracy!
{35188}{35240}Tess can´t get the kid to take off|these smelly clothes.
{35242}{35313}Chief, I am a candidate for mayor.
{35315}{35401}If you can´t control Detective Tracy,|you´ll just have to take him off duty.
{35403}{35485}Or I´ll have to prosecute him|and take you off duty.
{35487}{35582}Tracy, Tess is havin´a terrible time|with this kid. What should I do?
{35633}{35687}Hey, hey, hey! Come here!|Come here! Hey, come on!
{35689}{35745}- You don´t have to wear|what Tess tells you to wear.|- No!
{35747}{35824}Come here! Where you goin´?|What are you runnin´ away from?
{35826}{35903}- I don´t need no suit.|A suit´s for school.|- School?
{35905}{36004}You can´t fool me. That means|the orphanage. I ain´t wearin´ no suit.
{36006}{36072}Kid, your clothes|don´t smell very good. Okay?
{36074}{36167}Now, if you don´t wanna wear a suit,|Just go back in there and say|you don´t wanna wear a suit.
{36169}{36224}Otherwise, pick the suit you like.
{36295}{36376}- Yeah?|- Yeah.
{36415}{36495}Just we two, flyin´ high|and hiding up in a tree
{36497}{36608}Live alone and like it|That´s the answer for me
{36610}{36697}Don´t come out of that tree|That´s the answer--
{36699}{36773}Get your mitts off of me!|I can do it myself!
{36775}{36827}- Oww!|- Get outta here!
{36829}{36922}- The young man will be out|in a moment, I presume.|- All right, when do we eat?
{36924}{36960}Live alone and like it
{36962}{37039}- Free as the birds in the trees|- When do we eat?
{37041}{37095}High above the briers|Live alone and like it
{37097}{37161}I do whatever I please
{37163}{37204}- When do we eat?|- What my heart desires
{37206}{37307}Free to hang around|or fly at any old time
{37309}{37386}- When do we eat?|- No equivocation
{37388}{37455}Most of all, no guarantees
{37457}{37523}That´s my only motto|Free of obligations
{37525}{37599}- Only the murmurin´ breeze|- When do we eat?
{37601}{37673}As an obbligato|Live alone and like it
{37675}{37751}Why is that such a crime
{37753}{37820}Free to call the tune
{37822}{37893}Free to say|if I´m gonna work or play
{37895}{37957}I can have the moon
{37959}{38040}But I don´t have to have it|night and day
{38042}{38133}Anyway, what I like is gliding|where the wind takes me to
{38135}{38202}Flyin´ high|and hiding up in a tree
{38204}{38314}Live alone and like it|That´s the answer for me
{38316}{38385}Don´t come out of that tree
{38387}{38440}That´s the answer for me
{38442}{38517}- Nice day.|- Yeah.
{38519}{38579}Uh...
{38720}{38778}What?
{38817}{38904}- I been thinkin´, Tess.|- What about?
{38906}{38988}- Well, you living alone.|- Oh, I like living alone.
{38990}{39078}-Huh?|-You know that. I´m not the lonely type.
{39080}{39144}Well...
{39146}{39197}that´s somethin´ we got in common.
{39199}{39252}Yep. We have that in common.
{39254}{39315}Well, don´t you think that,|since we have so much in common...
{39317}{39455}it might be a good idea|if we just went ahead and--
{39491}{39571}Yes?
{39573}{39646}Uh, well...
{40033}{40120}Look, I-I-I-I wasn´t thinkin´|about you livin´ alone...
{40122}{40206}as much as I-- I was--|I was thinkin´ about me livin´ alone.
{40208}{40279}- I mean--|- What?|- Hey, Tracy, watch out!
{40464}{40543}- Tracy, wait!|- Hey, are you all right, kid?
{40545}{40591}- Yeah, I´m okay.|- Thanks for the tip.
{40593}{40661}- Who was it, Tracy?|- I don´t know, kid.
{40663}{40740}- I thought we was goners.|- They´re just tryin´ to scare us.|They´re just tryin´ to scare us.
{40742}{40821}Geez, this is incredible!|What are we waitin´ for? Let´s get ´em!
{40823}{40919}Let´s get ´em! Come on, let´s go!|We can still get ´em!
{40921}{41003}- They took a right! I saw!|- I´m sorry.
{41005}{41075}- This is amazing, Tracy!|Come on! Let´s go!|- Tracy.
{41077}{41171}When you play in the street,|it´s part of the game-- I know that.
{41173}{41271}-Just don´t ask me to like it.|- Come on, let´s go!
{41364}{41426}Where´d they go? Where´d they go?
{41428}{41479}They headed up towards Main Street.
{41481}{41539}W-Who was it, Tracy?
{41541}{41613}I don´t know, boys. Do me a favour.|Stick around here, will ya?
{41615}{41666}Sure, Tracy.
{42520}{42585}Police have hit a stone wall|in their search for the perpetrators...
{42587}{42718}and the citizens of the peace-abiding|neighborhoods are up in arms|over the relentless gunfire|which shattered the night.
{42720}{42826}Crime is rampant in the streets. The|only general who can take them back--
{42828}{42953}Thanks for calling.|I was beginning to wonder|what a girl had to do to get arrested.
{43004}{43092}Well, wearing that dress|is a step in the right direction.
{43338}{43426}Are you gonna make a move,|or do I have to do everything?
{43461}{43502}I´m on duty.
{43504}{43579}- What´s your day off?|- Sunday.
{43581}{43669}It´s a big world.|Must be Sunday somewhere.
{43828}{43896}Seem hot to you?
{43898}{43956}Hot?
{44070}{44128}Why´d you call me here?
{44186}{44244}You know that car?
{44329}{44473}What I´m looking for is a driver.|Preferably one with some mileage.
{44475}{44533}Yeah?
{44636}{44724}I called you here ´cause I wanted|to know if you´re ready to testify.
{45029}{45086}No.
{45298}{45361}You´re right, Tracy.|Why would you get mixed up with me?
{45363}{45427}I´m a cheap floozie to you.
{45429}{45547}I´ll be lucky if I get through the week|alive. They probably followed me here.
{45590}{45669}It isn´t easy, Tracy.
{45671}{45754}You wanna throw me in jail?|Go ahead.
{46054}{46111}- Let´s dance|- Watch the kid.
{46126}{46188}You can do a little two-step
{46190}{46254}I´ll go anywhere that you step to
{46256}{46330}´Cause now I´m following you
{46363}{46418}My feet
{46420}{46495}Might be fallin´out of rhythm
{46497}{46547}Don´t know|what I´m doin´ with ´em
{46549}{46627}But I know I´m following you
{47041}{47112}I remember all of you|from when I was nothin´.
{47114}{47233}Pruneface, you tossed a fire bomb in my|car one night. Give me a lot of trouble,|but I forgive you.
{47235}{47338}Mocca, you put three slugs into me,|but I lived. I forgive you too.
{47340}{47429}I owe everybody at this table a little|somethin´, but I forgive all of you.
{47431}{47553}Why? Because I put the past|in the past.
{47555}{47640}However, a boss who cannot|see the future...
{47642}{47704}becomes a liability|to everyone concerned.
{47706}{47770}What are you, a fortune-teller?|What do you mean, the future?
{47808}{47881}Pruneface, what I mean...
{47883}{47935}is the future is me.
{47969}{48049}Pat, Sam, come in. This is Tracy.|I followed her to the Club Ritz.
{48051}{48156}It looks like we got|every hood in town in one room--|Pruneface, Flattop,Johnny Ramm.
{48158}{48232}- Those guys hate each other.|- Better get over here fast.
{48234}{48309}- I gotta find out why they´re together.|- All right, let´s go.
{48311}{48392}Baby, you´re mine on a platter
{48394}{48457}I always
{48459}{48547}Get my
{48688}{48799}We got a problem with organization.|We´re all split up. That´s bad business.
{48801}{48867}While we´re divided,|the cops can keep us under control.
{48869}{48974}But use your imaginations.|We form this big company, see.
{48976}{49088}Each of us here at the table|are on the board of directors.
{49090}{49144}- I´m chairman of the board.|- Why you?
{49212}{49275}Because I have a vision.
{49277}{49345}A big boss must have a vision.
{49347}{49472}We got a town with thousands|of small stores and businesses,|people who are workin´ real hard.
{49474}{49558}I think they should be|workin´ real hard for us...
{49560}{49660}because we are for the people.
{49662}{49828}And ´´if you ain´t for the people,|you can´t buy the people.´´ Lincoln.
{49830}{49919}We will become|the people´s silent partner.
{49921}{50035}Every time some citizen buys|a pound of hamburger, we get a nickel.
{50037}{50115}Every time some guy gets a haircut,|we get a dime.
{50117}{50204}We´ll dress like bankers,|Join the Rotary Club.
{50206}{50284}Together we will own this town.
{50286}{50358}Why you?
{50360}{50439}- Excuse me.|- Hey.
{50441}{50518}When do we kill Dick Tracy?
{50520}{50629}As you know, if anything happens|to Tracy, I´m the prime suspect.
{50631}{50723}- Leave Dick Tracy to me.|- I say we kill Tracy now.
{50725}{50777}- You say?|- I say.
{50779}{50931}I say you say nothing.|I say you get behind me, we all profit.
{50933}{50996}You challenge me,|we all go down.
{50998}{51122}There was one Napoleon,|one Washington, one me.
{51153}{51214}I´m out.
{51216}{51298}It only works if we´re all in.
{51332}{51393}Then it don´t work.
{51395}{51481}I got a good business.|I´ll take my chances alone.
{51554}{51642}Let him go, let him go.|It´s still a free country.
{51732}{51830}Maybe he´ll have a change of heart.
{51867}{51979}Sam, I´m worried about Tracy. What would|it take to make you go off your trolley?
{51981}{52034}Not me. I´m not the type.
{52036}{52090}Tracy, are you crazy?|You don´t have a search warrant.
{52092}{52157}If you don´t get off that ledge,|do you have any idea|what the D.A. will do to you?
{52159}{52233}-Yeah, Tracy, this is Pat. Come on down.|-Just be ready to get me outta here.
{52313}{52370}Who´s that? Spaldoni?
{52372}{52423}I think that´s Spaldoni leaving.
{52425}{52510}If any of those bums find you up there,|Tracy, the chief´ll never forgive you.
{52512}{52607}Come on, Tracy, get off that building.|If they catch you, they got a perfect|right to do whatever they want.
{52627}{52667}- Great Scott!|- Great Scott!
{52920}{52960}Very upsetting.
{53057}{53112}Go, Sam! Get him!
{53601}{53663}Peppermint. Try some.
{53741}{53819}You know, Tracy, for a tough guy|you do a lot of pansy things.
{53821}{53898}Is that right?
{53900}{53953}- Who is it?|- Mr Tracy?
{53955}{54011}- Who is it?|- I´m Mrs Skaff.
{54013}{54093}- I´m from the welfare department.|- The welfare department?
{54095}{54198}I´m afraid we´re going to have to|take the little boy to the orphanage.
{54200}{54252}Well, just give me one minute,|Mrs Skaff.
{54254}{54317}I hope you understand, Mr Tracy.
{54319}{54446}As a single man, you can´t just|pick up a child from the streets|and take him home.
{54448}{54532}- Mrs Skaff, let´s discuss this.|- He belongs in the orphanage.|It´s the law.
{54534}{54615}Then he has to be processed|through the proper channels. And then--
{54617}{54735}Uh, Mrs Skaff, if you´ll just leave|this situation to me, I think you´ll--
{54737}{54874}- We don´t want no kid, copper.|- Yeah, we don´t want no kid, copper.|Get dressed.
{55028}{55151}Go on, get in there,|or I´ll plug ya. Go on.
{55516}{55593}Glad you could join us, Tracy.
{55595}{55697}We thought you´d be|much more comfortable meeting us here|in the basement of your girlfriend´s|apartment building...
{55699}{55751}while she´s away at work.
{55753}{55825}You know, Dick--|You mind if I call you Dick?
{55827}{55952}My associates here would very much|like to see you have a little accident.
{55954}{56012}But I tell ´em no.
{56014}{56142}I´ll take care of Tracy myself,|I tell ´em. You know why?
{56144}{56274}I want you on my side!|And let me tell you what my side is.
{56276}{56394}My side is a lifetime of action|and adventure with no clock to punch.
{56396}{56465}It´s treatin´ that gal of yours|one hundred percent.
{56467}{56558}She should be treated like a princess,|protected like a baby.
{56560}{56648}- You gonna put|all that money down there?|- Fifteen thousand clams.
{56756}{56814}- It´s a deal.|- Fifteen thousand clams!
{56816}{56949}Welcome to new waters, Dick! We´re gonna|run one hell of a ship with you aboard.
{56951}{57042}There´s a big world out there,|and it´s up for sale, all of it.
{57044}{57139}All we gotta do is make sure|that the people know...
{57141}{57189}I´m the one|big enough to run it.
{57191}{57321}And that you are guilty of attempting|to bribe an officer of the law.
{57323}{57371}- Hey, hey!|- Not so fast, copper.
{57373}{57446}- You dumb dick.|- Let´s give it to ´im!
{57448}{57505}- Okay, boys!|- Do it!
{57507}{57590}You have just said goodbye to oxygen.
{57592}{57728}You silly, stupid cop.|You refuse me?
{57730}{57805}I offer you the keys to a kingdom...
{57807}{57878}and you tell me|you´re an officer of the law.
{57880}{57967}I am the law! Me!
{58002}{58095}Boys, you guaranteed me that|this is gonna look like an accident.
{58097}{58161}Don´t disappoint me.|So long, sucker.
{58193}{58254}- You should´ve made the deal.|- Yeah!
{58256}{58381}You´re gonna have|one terrible accident, Tracy.|You think they´re gonna find your body?
{58383}{58448}- Dumb dick.|- I didn´t think Tracy´d take a bribe.
{58480}{58585}Ouch! This accident´s been waitin´|to happen all day, Tracy.
{58587}{58675}You sure you don´t wanna|change your mind? Huh?
{58893}{58971}- I guess that´s the end of Dick.|- Yeah. Thirty seconds, no more Dick.
{58973}{59039}Thirty seconds, no more Dick.|Thirty seconds, no more Dick.
{59156}{59237}Hey, Tracy!
{59239}{59310}Kid! Get outta here!|Get away from there!
{59568}{59699}Hurry! It´s gonna explode!|Get outta here, kid! Get outta here!
{59806}{59903}Don´t worry, Tracy!|I´ll get you outta here!
{60375}{60433}Hit the dirt!
{60792}{60909}- Geez, Tracy, that was a lot of dough.|- You´re all right, kid.
{60911}{60987}For action in the face of grave danger,|the Kid...
{60989}{61047}whose name will be filled in|when he thinks of one...
{61049}{61138}is awarded this honorary|detective certificate with badge.
{61140}{61247}- Congratulations, pal.|- The best-lookin´ officer on the force,|with or without a name.
{61249}{61327}Well, this is just|a temporary certificate|till you pick a name for yourself.
{61329}{61378}- What´s the matter with Kid?|- Nothin´.
{61380}{61454}This means no more jumpin´|on the back of cars. Got it?
{61456}{61517}- Tracy.|- When does his certificate|become permanent?
{61519}{61608}- I got a badge for you.|- When he picks a name.|- What do you mean?
{61610}{61691}- Look in your top drawer.|- He´s already got the makin´s|of a detective.
{61693}{61781}- Chief, it´s temporary|till he picks a name, huh?|- Sure. He´ll pick a name.
{61783}{61888}Couple of years, this kid´ll be drivin´.|Maybe I´ll make him my partner.
{61890}{61965}Sam, that´s somethin´, isn´t it?|How´d you like to pick your own name?
{61967}{62089}- Put ´er there, Detective.|- You know what I´d pick? I´d pick Sam.
{62091}{62182}What´s the matter?|We´re not payin´ you enough money?
{62184}{62293}Don´t tell me about my boys|messin´ up the Tracy rub-out.
{62295}{62347}They were being tested.|They flunked.
{62349}{62418}Now they´re just flunkies, like you.
{62420}{62479}I don´t care if Tracy|puts one and one together.
{62481}{62552}Don´t matter to me.|You´re still workin´ for me.
{62554}{62647}You´re on my side.|You´re not out. You´re not out!
{62649}{62764}When you are dead, then you are out.|You are mine. I own you.
{63333}{63387}Tracy, we´ve got 1 4 witnesses.

{64916}{65000}- She´s pretty.|- She´s a lot more than that.
{65293}{65388}Look, if I testify against Big Boy,|he´ll have me bumped off.
{65390}{65473}- He´d have to bump me off first.|- Why?
{65475}{65556}Because I´d be protecting you|24 hours a day.
{65558}{65649}- You would?|- Yeah. That´s my job.
{65651}{65739}Do you always put so much of yourself|into your job?
{65955}{66012}You´re not gonna know that|till you testify.
{66063}{66149}You´re a good man, Tracy.
{66151}{66219}And I wanna do the right thing.

{69748}{69838}Who do I tell him you are?
{69840}{69921}You don´t,|because you never saw me.
{69923}{70042}And don´t try to find me.|I´ll call you.
{70044}{70105}Make the deal.
{70276}{70388}´´If you kill Dick Tracy,|you will be the prime suspect|and the city will mobilize against you.

{80005}{80051}Everywhere I turn...
{80053}{80135}it´s Tracy, Tracy, Tracy!
{80137}{80183}It´s like he´s readin´ my mind.
{80185}{80300}Texie Garcia, Ribs Mocca, Johnny Ramm|and now de Santo-- I don´t get it.

{82516}{82574}Tracy, I´m-- I´m leavin´.
{82650}{82756}I used to be afraid that maybe you´d|never take some time and settle down...
{82758}{82818}and now I know it.
{82861}{82941}- I knew you´d never|want a desk job, Tracy.|- Calling Dick Tracy.

{86540}{86601}What´s the matter? You bums|forgot how to kill people?
{86603}{86658}Doesn´t your work|mean anything to you any more?
{86660}{86727}Have you no sense of pride|in what you do?
{86729}{86813}No sense of duty?|No sense of destiny?
{86815}{86921}I´m lookin´ for generals!|What do I got? Foot soldiers.
{86923}{86994}I want Dick Tracy dead!
{87056}{87165}Don´t get me wrong, Tracy.|If you say there was a man with no face,|I´ll bet the mortgage there was.
{87167}{87217}- But who is he workin´ for?|- Yeah, who´s he workin´ for?
{87219}{87337}I don´t know, boys, but I didn´t dream|him up. Would you get my suit cleaned?|We need a witness who will testify.

{88748}{88791}- Sayin´ to ya|- And one for me too.
{88793}{88876}What can you lose
{88878}{88940}Maybe it shows
{88942}{89000}She´s had clues
{89002}{89106}Which she chose to ignore
{89108}{89163}Maybe, though, she knows
{89165}{89301}And just wants to go on|as before
{89303}{89421}As a friend, nothin´more
{89423}{89515}So she closes the door
{89557}{89672}Well, if she does
{89674}{89787}Those are the dues
{89789}{89894}Once the words are spoken|something may be broken
{89896}{89960}Still you love her
{89962}{90047}What can you lose
{90049}{90123}But what if she goes
{90125}{90223}At least now|you have part of her
{90225}{90342}What if she had to choose
{90344}{90452}Leave it alone
{90454}{90541}Hold it all in
{90569}{90614}Let her alone
{90616}{90674}Don´t even begin
{90676}{90787}With so much to win
{90832}{90897}There´s too much
{90899}{91036}To lose
{91148}{91198}Cheer up, Tracy.|I´m the one in danger.
{91200}{91249}I shouldn´t be talking to a cop.
{91251}{91319}- You know what I want.|- I want to hear you say it.
{91321}{91373}- Well, I don´t want you to be hurt.|- Don´t tell me what you don´t want.
{91375}{91448}Tell me what you do want.
{91494}{91569}You want me.
{91609}{91661}Don´t you?
{91663}{91725}You´re right. I do want you,|in court where you can tell the truth--
{91727}{91812}You´re lying. You want me|the same way that I want you.
{91814}{91873}You want me to take a risk?|I want you to take a risk.
{91875}{91915}I told you I´d protect you|if you testified.
{91917}{91986}- Protect me? You ca--|- It´s my job.|- I don´t know about your job.
{91988}{92035}I only know what I feel.
{92037}{92096}If you can´t tell me how you feel,|Tracy, then I can´t trust you.
{92098}{92181}Wait a minute.|What do you want me to admit?
{92183}{92239}That I think about you?
{92241}{92309}Okay, I admit it. Testify.
{92311}{92414}You want my testimony?|Tell me you want me.
{92416}{92532}If you do that, I´ll do anything|you say. How bad do you want Big Boy?
{92534}{92626}It´s up to you.|Tell me you want me.
{92628}{92719}Tell me you want it all,|but tell me now.
{92880}{92974}If I say that, I´m gonna hurt|somebody I don´t want to hurt.
{93142}{93195}You trust her.
{93317}{93361}I love her.
{93725}{93779}He could be president|of the United States...
{93781}{93833}and he´d call it a desk job.
{93835}{93900}Dick Tracy´s awfully tough on himself.
{93902}{94000}He´s torn, Tess.|He´s torn between love and duty.
{94002}{94087}If you get too close to a man like that,|you probably won´t be treated...
{94089}{94145}much better than he treats himself.
{94147}{94244}It takes a lot of understanding|to love a man like that.
{94246}{94297}What did you say, Mother?
{94299}{94380}I said, ´´It takes a lot of|understanding to love a man like that.´´
{94579}{94636}He´ll never take a desk job.
{94677}{94752}This--
{94784}{94842}Yeah?
{94844}{94891}Sit down, will you.
{94893}{94965}Sam, Mrs Trueheart said|Tess left there a long time ago.
{94967}{95017}Has somebody checked|Route Three for accidents?
{95019}{95059}Right, Tracy.
{95061}{95119}We gotta talk about|this orphanage business.
{95121}{95168}- Who wants--|- Tracy, did you get the sketch?
{95170}{95232}Yes, I got the sketch. I got both|sketches. They´re both the same sketch.
{95234}{95303}Forget the sketch!|Check Route Three for accidents!
{95305}{95376}- We´re working on it, Tracy.|- Don´t work on it, do it!
{95378}{95439}- Right.|- Right.
{95441}{95523}I sure hope she comes back to him.|I´ve never seen him like this.
{95525}{95590}The welfare office called again.
{95592}{95652}I´m not supposed to keep you|out of the orphanage.
{96373}{96474}Yes, and then send the letter|to District Attorney Fletcher.
{96476}{96533}- Can you do it?|- Oh!
{96535}{96605}- I can do anyone´s handwriting.|- All right. Tracy´s handwriting.
{96607}{96703}Write this: ´´District Attorney Fletcher,|I have evidence that will destroy you.

{96800}{96844}Bring $ 1 0,000...
{96846}{96944}to room 429, Midway Hotel.
{97902}{98004}If you want to stay alive,|you´ll do what Big Boy says.
{98060}{98137}That´s not it! That´s not it!|Does Paddy O´Brien know she´s missing?
{98139}{98182}- Yeah.|- Was he the one?|- That´s not him.
{98184}{98258}- That´s not it! That´s not it!|That´s n-- What´s that?|- It´s for you.
{98260}{98333}-Open it.|-Pat, what about that guy from up north?
{98335}{98385}You hear anything about him?|What´s his name? Louie.
{98387}{98450}- Oh, yeah, Louie-- Louie the Louse.|- Yeah. Where is he?

{107349}{107395}Well, you did the right thing|to call me, Kid.
{107397}{107446}Tracy´s in real bad shape about Tess.
{107448}{107494}She´s still missing,|and we haven´t a clue.
{107496}{107547}It looks like a kidnapping,|but nobody´s asked for a ransom.
{107549}{107632}- Tracy´s the only one who can find her.|-Judge said, ´´No bail.´´
{107634}{107728}He didn´t do it, Chief.|He didn´t do it.
{107730}{107825}Why would somebody kidnap Tess|and not even ask for a ransom?
{107827}{107874}If I can just get back|on that street--
{107876}{108003}I´ll leave you two alone for a minute.|It´ll be anytime now.

{113271}{113347}So what do we do? Grab 88 Keys|or go straight for Big Boy?
{113349}{113415}Yeah, Tracy, what do we do?|Grab 88 Keys or go straight for Big Boy?

{123052}{123112}Big Boy!
{123263}{123324}Come on! Get outta there!
{123844}{123908}You know, sometimes I wonder|why I try to improve things.

{128609}{128687}I´ve been humiliated by a woman.
{128689}{128751}The way I see it--|and Plato agrees with me--
{128753}{128877}is that there is what is, and then|there is what we would like it to be.
{128879}{128996}But that´s not important.|What´s important is the future;|it´s planning ahead.

{129636}{129723}take that journey, that journey|into that faraway land...
{129725}{129764}a land that just waits.
{129766}{129845}It waits by the track|where the train of destiny must run...
{129847}{129944}run into the future,|breaking the shackles of the past.
{129946}{130035}Forget the past. Forget the past.|Our limitations are our shackles.

{130202}{130289}Can´t you see I love you?
{130291}{130342}Wait! What´s that?
{130389}{130473}Hands up, copper! We gotta talk.

{131302}{131414}Tracy, I did not kidnap this girl.|Somebody´s trying to frame me.
{131416}{131492}Where are you? Come on!Just let me|see ya. I just wanna see your face.

{131735}{131798}Tracy, you hear that?|What´s happening to that can...
{131800}{131878}is going to be happening|to her head in a few seconds!
{131880}{131955}There´s not going to be|any more beautiful hair to fondle, huh?
{131957}{132015}No, no ears to nuzzle.
{132017}{132098}You´re gonna have|chopped sweetheart, Tracy.
{132100}{132186}There. See those gears?|Those gears are like a clock.

{133451}{133526}Get your hands up, Tracy.|Don´t move, either one of ya.
{133575}{133682}I outsmarted ya, Big Boy.|I knew you´d panic.
{133684}{133802}I brought you down with kidnapping,|the only crime you didn´t commit.
{133804}{133898}Whoever you are,|I know we can make a deal.
{133900}{133989}A deal?|I´m making my deal with Tracy.
{133991}{134074}Tracy, with Big Boy out of the way,|we can own this town.

{135398}{135437}Hey, Tracy, look.
{135869}{135928}Is he still alive?
{136138}{136230}Will you look at that.
{136274}{136338}Tess? Call an ambulance.
{136467}{136558}I´ll call, Tess. I´ll go get it.
{136729}{136820}You were right, Tracy.|I couldn´t pull the trigger.
{136822}{136882}It was a good plan, Breathless.|You almost pulled it off.
{136884}{137009}- The city would´ve been yours.|- Yeah. You were my only mistake.
{137011}{137110}Tell me the truth. Could it ever|have happened between us?
{139675}{139745}But that´s how we got him to confess|that Breathless killed Fletcher.
{139747}{139815}- He was her piano player.|- Not bad.
{139817}{139913}Thanks. Mm-hmm. You know, you´re|probably much too smart to need this...

{140484}{140547}- Tess?|- What?
{140549}{140597}I´ve been thinking.
{140599}{140701}- What about?|- Well, you livin´ alone and--
{140703}{140780}Well, I like living alone.
{140782}{140865}- Uh-huh.|- We have that in common, I guess.
{140867}{140950}- Uh-huh. Uh-huh.|- Well, don´t we?
{141002}{141093}Well, I just think when two people|have so much in common...
{141095}{141161}they oughta do somethin´ about it.
{141299}{141379}- Would--|- Uh-oh.
{141381}{141462}Shut up, kid. And--

{143501}{143585}Come on. Metropolitan Bank.|Come on. Step on it!
{143639}{143735}You know something, Tracy?|I kinda like that dame.
{144596}{144672}Once upon a time|I had plenty of nothin´
{144674}{144764}Which was fine with me|because I had rhythm, music, love
{144766}{144815}The sun, the stars|and the moon above
{144817}{144937}Had the clear blue sky|and the deep blue sea
{144939}{145044}That was when the best things|in life were free
{145046}{145130}Then time went by and now|I get plenty of plenty
{145132}{145192}Which is fine with me|´cause I still got love
{145194}{145288}I still got rhythm, but look|at what I got to go with ´em
{145321}{145449}Who could ask for anything more|I hear you query
{145451}{145573}Who could ask for anything more|Well, let me tell you
{145575}{145645}Dearie
{145716}{145769}Got my diamonds
{145771}{145824}Got my yacht
{145826}{145936}Got a guy I adore
{145938}{146043}I´m so happy with what I got
{146045}{146157}I want more
{146159}{146212}Count your blessings
{146214}{146265}One, two, three
{146267}{146375}I just hate keeping score
{146377}{146475}Any number is fine with me
{146477}{146567}As long as it´s more
{146569}{146652}As long as it´s more
{146654}{146761}I´m no mathematician
{146763}{146871}All I know is addition
{146873}{146973}I find counting a bore
{146975}{147040}Keep the number mounting|Your accountant does the counting
{147042}{147097}More
{147202}{147255}I got rhythm

{147312}{147422}Just as much as before
{147424}{147532}Got my guy and my sky of blue
{147534}{147640}Now, however, I own the view
{147642}{147734}More is better than nothing, true
{147736}{147853}But nothing´s better than|more, more, more
{147855}{147982}- Nothing´s better than more|- More
{148022}{148074}One is fun|Why not two
{148076}{148127}And if you like two|you might as well have four
{148129}{148182}And if you like four|why not a few
{148184}{148259}Why not a slew more
{148261}{148317}If you got a little|why not a lot
{148319}{148368}Add a bit and it´ll|get to be an oodle
{148370}{148423}Every jot and tittle|adds to the pot
{148425}{148479}Soon you´ve got the kit|as well as the caboodle
{148481}{148530}More

{148696}{148747}Happy with ten|Happier with twenty
{148749}{148862}If you like a penny|wouldn´t you like many much more
{148864}{148971}Or does that sound too greedy
{148973}{149079}That´s not greed, no, indeedy
{149081}{149178}That´s just stocking the store
{149180}{149243}Gotta fill your cupboard|Remember Mother Hubbard
{149245}{149298}More
{149300}{149353}More
{149355}{149460}Each possession you possess
{149462}{149570}Helps your spirits to soar
{149572}{149676}That´s what´s soothing about excess
{149678}{149772}Something´s better than nothing, yes
{149774}{149888}But nothing´s better than|more, more, more
{149890}{149945}Except all, all, all
{149947}{150021}Except once
{150023}{150105}You have it all
{150107}{150155}Have it all
{150157}{150279}You may find all else above
{150281}{150367}Else above
{150369}{150451}That though things
{150453}{150530}Are bliss
{150532}{150671}There´s one thing you miss
{150701}{150782}And
{150784}{150858}That´s
