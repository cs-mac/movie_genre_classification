1
00:01:22,141 --> 00:01:26,775
<i>Beat your wings
Lest you succumb to the rain</i>

2
00:01:35,556 --> 00:01:41,433
<i>And now the sun shines</i>

3
00:01:44,471 --> 00:01:47,232
<i>From the dark into the light...
The dark into the light</i>

4
00:01:47,345 --> 00:01:52,559
The dark, dark, dark...

5
00:01:53,928 --> 00:01:57,684
There it is... I see... I'm through...

6
00:01:58,385 --> 00:02:00,933
Into the light.

7
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:07,932
What's going on, little bro?

8
00:02:08,425 --> 00:02:09,765
Nothing.

9
00:02:11,717 --> 00:02:14,478
- You want a beer?
- Yeah.

10
00:02:18,924 --> 00:02:24,304
And then surely the day
follows the night.

11
00:02:24,423 --> 00:02:27,433
As a knight takes the bishop.

12
00:02:27,631 --> 00:02:30,973
My old friends,
it's been such a long time.

13
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:33,844
It's been such a long time.
I missed you.

14
00:02:33,963 --> 00:02:35,930
I missed you.

15
00:02:36,046 --> 00:02:38,428
I missed you, my friends.

16
00:02:38,546 --> 00:02:40,714
It's a nice one, isn't it?

17
00:02:40,837 --> 00:02:43,882
Lovely, lovely. Yes, indeed.

18
00:02:44,003 --> 00:02:46,136
All warriors. They're
all warriors here, see?

19
00:02:50,002 --> 00:02:51,045
Uncle Jim made that

20
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:53,965
when he was locked up.

21
00:02:54,085 --> 00:02:57,877
It's a war game, a pakanga.

22
00:02:58,042 --> 00:02:59,713
Those are all warriors there.

23
00:02:59,834 --> 00:03:03,294
- Can I play you?
- You don't know how to play.

24
00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:04,886
Can you teach me?

25
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:07,886
Fuck, you're a nosy little
bugger, aren't you?

26
00:03:07,999 --> 00:03:09,919
Is there someone you want me to call?

27
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:13,134
No, you couldn't. You can't do that.
I mean...

28
00:03:13,248 --> 00:03:14,339
<i>Rm; Lopez.</i>

29
00:03:14,456 --> 00:03:17,301
There it is, right there.
That's on B5, not C4.

30
00:03:17,456 --> 00:03:19,414
- I'm sorry?
- And you want the Sicilian Defence?

31
00:03:19,456 --> 00:03:21,873
Well, impossible.
C5, that's where that should be.

32
00:03:21,997 --> 00:03:24,498
Your fianchetto bishop, he's on the G7.

33
00:03:24,622 --> 00:03:26,506
That's the way it should be,
but that's not what's happening.

34
00:03:26,621 --> 00:03:27,830
What's happening here
is the Scotch Game.

35
00:03:27,954 --> 00:03:29,376
<i>The bishop takes GA.</i>

36
00:03:29,496 --> 00:03:31,380
And play the gambit,
ease them into the game.

37
00:03:31,495 --> 00:03:33,380
Nice and easy. Here she comes.

38
00:03:34,037 --> 00:03:35,956
Show them the way. Show them... Easy.

39
00:03:36,078 --> 00:03:39,420
See? It's alright, everyone.
You're gonna be okay.

40
00:03:39,536 --> 00:03:41,539
- See this fella?
- Yeah.

41
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:42,870
He's a pawn.

42
00:03:42,994 --> 00:03:45,755
He's basically the weakest fella
on the board.

43
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,127
- Like you.
- Shut up.

44
00:03:48,243 --> 00:03:49,664
This lady?

45
00:03:49,784 --> 00:03:51,170
The queen.

46
00:03:51,284 --> 00:03:53,203
She's like Papatuanuku.

47
00:03:53,909 --> 00:03:55,958
Earth Mother.

48
00:03:56,075 --> 00:03:57,745
She can move wherever she wants,

49
00:03:57,866 --> 00:04:01,493
but she'll always come back
'cause she loves...

50
00:04:02,949 --> 00:04:07,120
The king,
who the pawn will grow up to be.

51
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:10,582
Like Maui, leader of his people.

52
00:04:10,697 --> 00:04:12,665
Lose him, lose the game.

53
00:04:14,114 --> 00:04:15,867
So you keep him safe.

54
00:04:18,696 --> 00:04:22,323
My angry friend... I'm sorry.

55
00:04:28,861 --> 00:04:30,829
Can only be one.

56
00:04:30,944 --> 00:04:32,615
Genesis?

57
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:35,860
Gen, do you want to come with me now?

58
00:04:36,193 --> 00:04:37,527
- He wasn't being...
- it's okay.

59
00:04:40,901 --> 00:04:43,402
Usually I have to do my notation.

60
00:04:43,526 --> 00:04:45,611
Gen?
yes?

61
00:04:46,817 --> 00:04:48,405
Do you want to play one with me?

62
00:04:48,525 --> 00:04:51,108
- Pardon?
- Teach me?

63
00:04:51,233 --> 00:04:53,117
- Teach you? Did I promise?
- Yeah.

64
00:04:53,232 --> 00:04:55,232
I promised to teach you.
I promised to teach you.

65
00:04:56,024 --> 00:04:58,109
I don't know how to...
I don't know how to...

66
00:04:58,232 --> 00:04:59,273
We'll come back.

67
00:04:59,356 --> 00:05:01,027
We could come back.
We can come back. Is that okay?

68
00:05:01,148 --> 00:05:02,189
- Yeah.
- Sure.

69
00:05:02,273 --> 00:05:03,778
- Okay, we'll come back.
- You teach me at home.

70
00:05:03,897 --> 00:05:05,735
Wonderful. I've been craving...

71
00:05:05,855 --> 00:05:08,107
I've been hanging out for a game.
I would just love to have a game.

72
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:09,782
That way, eh?

73
00:05:09,896 --> 00:05:12,574
- Yeah?
- Beautiful.

74
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:15,858
Gonna head this way...

75
00:05:15,979 --> 00:05:17,733
And get in the van, eh?
And come with...

76
00:05:17,853 --> 00:05:20,319
- That's better.
- Come with me to the van.

77
00:05:20,436 --> 00:05:22,025
No, no. Thank you.

78
00:05:22,144 --> 00:05:24,229
- No, Genesis, come here.
- I <i>was</i> just playing a game.

79
00:05:24,352 --> 00:05:26,651
- Come get... Just look at me.
- No, I think I'll go back there by...

80
00:05:26,769 --> 00:05:28,606
- No, no.
- Hey.

81
00:05:28,768 --> 00:05:30,985
It's okay. Gen, you're
not well right now.

82
00:05:31,101 --> 00:05:32,653
Gen. Listen to me, Gen.

83
00:05:32,768 --> 00:05:33,775
I was playing a game of chess.

84
00:05:33,892 --> 00:05:35,528
- Gen?
- I just want to go back!

85
00:05:35,684 --> 00:05:38,813
- Gen, it's going to be okay. Gen.
- No, come on.

86
00:05:38,933 --> 00:05:41,351
Genesis! You're gonna be okay, all
right? You need to get into the van.

87
00:05:41,475 --> 00:05:42,482
You're all right. Here we go.

88
00:05:42,599 --> 00:05:45,894
- In there. Get in the van.
- No!

89
00:05:46,016 --> 00:05:47,057
Come on, Genesis.

90
00:06:03,513 --> 00:06:04,769
Hi, Gen.

91
00:06:07,429 --> 00:06:09,763
I've spoken with Dr Andrews.

92
00:06:09,887 --> 00:06:12,470
He doesn't feel we're going to be able
to release you this time

93
00:06:12,595 --> 00:06:14,846
without someone to look after you.

94
00:06:14,969 --> 00:06:19,105
A family member, support person,
that sort of thing.

95
00:06:19,219 --> 00:06:21,933
Is there someone you'd like us to call?

96
00:07:28,457 --> 00:07:30,377
How are you?

97
00:07:44,538 --> 00:07:46,506
No, bro.

98
00:07:46,621 --> 00:07:48,838
Don't think I can help you.

99
00:07:50,746 --> 00:07:52,795
Be better off with someone else.

100
00:07:56,661 --> 00:07:58,250
Bro...

101
00:08:00,286 --> 00:08:01,956
There ain't nobody else.

102
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:10,916
Just gonna end up back
in here anyway, eh?

103
00:08:11,034 --> 00:08:12,456
Ain't you?

104
00:08:16,866 --> 00:08:18,916
Please.

105
00:08:37,863 --> 00:08:39,119
<i>Don't skip a dose.</i>

106
00:08:39,238 --> 00:08:41,287
<i>Don't get less than eight hours'
uninterrupted sleep</i> a <i>night.</i>

107
00:08:41,404 --> 00:08:43,905
<i>You got an emergency script for
lithium, Zopiclone, and benzodiazepine.</i>

108
00:08:44,029 --> 00:08:45,747
<i>And try to avoid anything
that could stress you out.</i>

109
00:08:45,862 --> 00:08:47,331
<i>Stress is the number-one trigger.</i>

110
00:08:47,445 --> 00:08:48,486
<i>Are you listening?</i>

111
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:50,952
<i>Your brother can have you readmitted.
Try to find something positive.</i>

112
00:08:51,069 --> 00:08:52,195
<i>There will be monitoring
calls twice a week.</i>

113
00:08:52,319 --> 00:08:53,445
<i>Avoid anything
that could stress you out.</i>

114
00:08:53,569 --> 00:08:54,825
<i>Stress is the number-one...</i>

115
00:08:54,944 --> 00:08:58,037
<i>...for lithium, Zopiclone,
and benzodiazepine.</i>

116
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:52,857
This is my boy's room.

117
00:09:52,976 --> 00:09:55,986
He can crash on the
couch in the lounge.

118
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:03,059
I'll be out in the house.

119
00:10:58,674 --> 00:11:00,428
What the fuck you doing in my bed?

120
00:11:06,506 --> 00:11:07,547
You awake?

121
00:11:08,922 --> 00:11:10,890
Mana, this is your uncle.

122
00:11:11,463 --> 00:11:13,264
He's gonna take your bed.

123
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:14,885
You got the couch.

124
00:11:16,796 --> 00:11:18,763
We're out of drinks.

125
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:21,841
- You up for it?
- Yes. Yeah.

126
00:11:21,962 --> 00:11:23,965
Take the boy.

127
00:11:24,086 --> 00:11:26,931
Any change, get yourself something.

128
00:11:42,542 --> 00:11:45,089
Yeah, I'll grab them. I
know what they want.

129
00:12:20,536 --> 00:12:22,535
I think there's only enough change
for one of us.

130
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,546
You have it.

131
00:12:28,576 --> 00:12:30,247
<i>So you're Dad's bro'?</i>

132
00:12:31,242 --> 00:12:33,624
You don't even look like him.

133
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,999
I reckon I look like him more than you.

134
00:12:40,532 --> 00:12:44,668
I reckon you should take the couch
and I take my bed back.

135
00:12:44,782 --> 00:12:46,452
What do you reckon?

136
00:12:48,739 --> 00:12:52,697
Yeah, I reckon that's the best idea
for both of us.

137
00:12:58,113 --> 00:13:00,614
So, where have you been hiding, then?

138
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:03,831
Me? Well...

139
00:13:03,945 --> 00:13:05,913
I've been travelling.

140
00:13:06,028 --> 00:13:08,611
Travelling?

141
00:13:08,736 --> 00:13:10,206
Like where?

142
00:13:17,193 --> 00:13:19,077
Don't worry about it.

143
00:13:22,442 --> 00:13:28,237
Well, I retraced the ascent of The
Creator when he ascended the 12 heavens

144
00:13:28,358 --> 00:13:29,863
on the sacred thread of a spider's web.

145
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:32,448
He <i>was</i> enlightened, that fella, eh?

146
00:13:32,649 --> 00:13:35,031
And I watched Maui catch the sun,

147
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:38,982
seize the day
with a magical net of woven flax,

148
00:13:39,106 --> 00:13:41,358
even witnessed Maui charm flames

149
00:13:41,481 --> 00:13:43,448
from the very fingertips
of the Goddess of Fire

150
00:13:43,564 --> 00:13:46,988
and her retaliate with breath of fire
like a dragon in hot pursuit.

151
00:13:50,646 --> 00:13:52,365
Been busy, eh?

152
00:13:54,604 --> 00:13:56,239
Yes.

153
00:14:01,686 --> 00:14:03,487
And I noticed this
fella across the road,

154
00:14:03,602 --> 00:14:06,363
and he was repping all his colours
and that. I thought, "True.“

155
00:14:06,477 --> 00:14:08,361
Looked straight at him,
and he was just staring at me,

156
00:14:08,477 --> 00:14:09,816
like he wasn't even
taking his eye off of me.

157
00:14:09,935 --> 00:14:11,144
And I was like, "True."

158
00:14:11,268 --> 00:14:13,851
So, I just barged straight over,
jumped off my bike,

159
00:14:13,976 --> 00:14:15,059
went straight up to him...

160
00:14:15,142 --> 00:14:16,813
You just what, bro?

161
00:14:22,808 --> 00:14:25,687
Come on, bro. Share it with the boys.

162
00:14:25,807 --> 00:14:27,775
- Nothing.
- Yeah.

163
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:29,727
Hey, where you going, mate?

164
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:32,983
Come and sit down, bro.
Have a beer with the boys. Come on.

165
00:14:33,098 --> 00:14:35,349
Hey, you too, bro.

166
00:14:37,347 --> 00:14:38,686
Sit down, mate.

167
00:14:38,805 --> 00:14:40,061
Whereabouts is the old man?

168
00:14:41,721 --> 00:14:43,522
Fucked if I know, bro.

169
00:14:43,804 --> 00:14:46,186
Fucked if I care, eh?

170
00:14:46,304 --> 00:14:48,307
Fill the pipe up too, bro.

171
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:53,517
Got some new sunnies there, bro?

172
00:14:56,677 --> 00:14:59,972
No, leave it on, bro. It's a good look.

173
00:15:00,093 --> 00:15:03,388
- Like a fuckin' real gangster, eh?
- Real gangster, eh, boy?

174
00:15:04,551 --> 00:15:05,724
Mean, all right.

175
00:15:09,592 --> 00:15:12,637
What, you scared or something, boy?

176
00:15:12,758 --> 00:15:15,175
Scared of 0l' scary Mutt, eh?

177
00:15:18,715 --> 00:15:20,007
No.

178
00:15:21,798 --> 00:15:24,340
Best you look at someone
when they're talking to you, eh, boy?

179
00:15:25,048 --> 00:15:26,885
Show you ain't afraid.

180
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:34,766
Fucking hell.

181
00:15:38,087 --> 00:15:40,718
Go on, boy. Get us a beer, boy.

182
00:15:55,626 --> 00:15:58,588
You all right there, bro?

183
00:15:58,751 --> 00:16:01,584
You keep staring, cuz, you're gonna
lose those fuckin' eyes in a sec.

184
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:05,675
Better me than a little kid, eh, bro?

185
00:16:07,624 --> 00:16:08,667
I ain't a fuckin' kid!

186
00:16:08,791 --> 00:16:11,540
I don't need your fuckin' help!
I didn't fuckin' ask for it, did I?

187
00:16:18,956 --> 00:16:20,461
- Yeah.
- See ya, man.

188
00:16:20,581 --> 00:16:22,085
Fuck off.

189
00:16:24,788 --> 00:16:27,005
Are you still here, bro?

190
00:16:27,538 --> 00:16:29,090
Fuck, he's gone, bro.

191
00:17:40,568 --> 00:17:41,777
Nobes.

192
00:17:53,899 --> 00:17:54,940
Yeah.

193
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:06,866
The fuck?

194
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:08,734
- Nobes.
- Genesis.

195
00:18:11,229 --> 00:18:12,948
How are you, bro?

196
00:18:14,104 --> 00:18:17,777
Shush, man! How am I?
Got bloody neighbours, man.

197
00:18:17,895 --> 00:18:20,028
What the fuck are you doing here?
Do you know what time it is?

198
00:18:20,145 --> 00:18:22,148
We need to talk. I got this idea.

199
00:18:22,311 --> 00:18:24,693
Listen, I like this area.

200
00:18:24,811 --> 00:18:27,193
I don't want to piss anybody off.

201
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:31,612
- All right? What do you want?
- Yes. This.

202
00:18:31,726 --> 00:18:34,060
I want to join it. I want
to be a part of this.

203
00:18:34,517 --> 00:18:36,318
Eastern Knights.

204
00:18:36,434 --> 00:18:37,903
It's for kids, Gen!

205
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:41,891
Well, that's fine.

206
00:18:42,058 --> 00:18:43,646
- That's fine?
- Yeah.

207
00:18:45,349 --> 00:18:47,186
How are you doing at
the moment, my male?

208
00:18:47,307 --> 00:18:49,274
Good. Really good.

209
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:51,523
- I'm better.
- You're better?

210
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:55,266
You're banging on my bedroom window
at 4:30 in the morning

211
00:18:55,389 --> 00:18:58,103
'cause you want to join
a kids' chess club

212
00:18:58,222 --> 00:19:00,687
and that's better?

213
00:19:00,805 --> 00:19:04,147
These kids are fucked
up enough as it is.

214
00:19:04,263 --> 00:19:06,063
I can't rock their boat.

215
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,805
Sorry, Gen.

216
00:19:09,928 --> 00:19:11,053
Glad you're feeling better.

217
00:19:11,137 --> 00:19:13,388
Hey, look, I could help. I can help.

218
00:19:13,511 --> 00:19:16,012
It's not even a real chess club, Gen.

219
00:19:16,136 --> 00:19:17,973
It's just someplace for them to go.

220
00:19:18,094 --> 00:19:20,262
Stability. Look at me. Stability.

221
00:19:21,968 --> 00:19:23,260
Now, I'm going back to bed

222
00:19:23,385 --> 00:19:25,802
'cause I got to be at work
in two fuckin' hours, bro.

223
00:19:25,926 --> 00:19:29,386
All right, I'll blend in.
You won't even know I'm there.

224
00:19:29,509 --> 00:19:31,511
Stability. <i>I</i> got n.

225
00:19:31,633 --> 00:19:33,885
Gen, no! No!

226
00:19:34,008 --> 00:19:36,591
I'll help organise, do
the dishes, make teas.

227
00:19:36,716 --> 00:19:37,806
We don't have tea.

228
00:19:38,549 --> 00:19:40,847
I don't care. I'm...

229
00:19:40,965 --> 00:19:43,548
No boat-rocking. I will
not rock the boat.

230
00:19:50,297 --> 00:19:54,433
If I agree to this,
will you get off my bloody doorstep?

231
00:20:02,212 --> 00:20:04,012
6:00 p.m. tomorrow.

232
00:20:05,961 --> 00:20:07,513
All right, my bro.

233
00:20:08,961 --> 00:20:10,631
Good night, Gen.

234
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:13,095
Eastern Knights!

235
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:15,971
Gen! Shut up!

236
00:20:51,412 --> 00:20:53,000
<i>ATM'?</i>

237
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:55,421
<i>ATM'?</i>

238
00:21:02,785 --> 00:21:04,504
What are you doing?

239
00:21:04,618 --> 00:21:06,952
I got to O-

240
00:21:07,076 --> 00:21:10,501
You were once a chess champ, eh?
The Dark Horse?

241
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:15,167
You know you shouldn't really
go through other people's things.

242
00:21:15,283 --> 00:21:18,080
Yeah, you shouldn't leave them
in other people's rooms.

243
00:21:18,991 --> 00:21:20,579
How come you stopped playing?

244
00:21:24,865 --> 00:21:25,907
Dad's home.

245
00:21:36,947 --> 00:21:38,037
Where you been?

246
00:21:38,155 --> 00:21:39,790
Drive to fuckin' Hamilton or something?

247
00:21:39,904 --> 00:21:41,326
Sorry. I've left your
keys right there, okay?

248
00:21:41,446 --> 00:21:42,572
No, no, you wait around.

249
00:21:42,696 --> 00:21:43,786
I want to talk to you.

250
00:21:43,904 --> 00:21:46,321
Mana, come out back. Blood's here.

251
00:22:03,817 --> 00:22:05,109
You coming?

252
00:22:10,274 --> 00:22:12,324
Hey, Boss.

253
00:22:34,104 --> 00:22:36,071
Thanks for coming, my brother.

254
00:22:37,229 --> 00:22:38,817
You know my boy.

255
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:42,026
Birthdays coming up.

256
00:22:42,978 --> 00:22:44,187
Fifteen.

257
00:22:44,352 --> 00:22:46,023
Been thinking.

258
00:22:46,602 --> 00:22:48,072
He's ready.

259
00:22:48,185 --> 00:22:49,655
I want him in.

260
00:22:53,559 --> 00:22:55,396
Some ain't right for it, eh?

261
00:22:56,809 --> 00:22:58,361
He is.

262
00:23:04,724 --> 00:23:06,608
This what you <i>want,</i> boy?

263
00:23:09,307 --> 00:23:10,516
Yeah.

264
00:23:12,764 --> 00:23:14,565
Old time's sake, my brother?

265
00:23:16,347 --> 00:23:18,267
Old time's sake.

266
00:23:22,055 --> 00:23:24,685
You want him done on his birthday?

267
00:23:27,137 --> 00:23:28,429
Right.

268
00:23:30,803 --> 00:23:32,095
- Mutt.
- Yeah?

269
00:23:32,886 --> 00:23:34,971
Boy's all yours now. Harden him up.

270
00:23:36,261 --> 00:23:38,394
We ain't patching no child.

271
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:40,394
Sweet as, bro.

272
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:43,058
Moment of truth now, boy?

273
00:23:55,591 --> 00:23:56,632
Sweet.

274
00:23:57,132 --> 00:23:59,550
Be seeing you soon, eh, boy?

275
00:24:04,839 --> 00:24:06,096
<i>ATM'?</i>

276
00:24:08,047 --> 00:24:09,848
You wanted to talk to me?

277
00:25:01,955 --> 00:25:04,373
Murray!

278
00:25:04,497 --> 00:25:05,883
Rusty! Rusty! Murray?

279
00:25:05,996 --> 00:25:07,797
- Hey, bro, can I have a turn?
- No.

280
00:25:07,913 --> 00:25:09,583
- No! No! You can't!
- I said please.

281
00:25:10,954 --> 00:25:13,371
Don't break the table, all right?
You do it every week.

282
00:25:14,703 --> 00:25:16,411
Don't you break it.
I'll break your face!

283
00:25:17,703 --> 00:25:19,453
Thank you for doing
what I said not to do.

284
00:25:22,369 --> 00:25:25,213
Calm down.
Calm down! Rusty.

285
00:25:25,327 --> 00:25:27,080
Come on, you fellas, calm down.
Shut up!

286
00:25:27,201 --> 00:25:28,493
Thank you, Nathan!

287
00:25:28,659 --> 00:25:29,667
All right, everyone, sit down, please.

288
00:25:30,034 --> 00:25:31,160
<i>- I'll</i> take you to...
- Murray, Murray!

289
00:25:31,534 --> 00:25:32,920
Boys, I told you, sit down.

290
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:41,124
Okay, so, you fellas who haven't had a
meal, there's some milk up there for you.

291
00:25:42,074 --> 00:25:43,543
And we've got a new member today.

292
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:45,709
Genesis Potini.

293
00:25:45,823 --> 00:25:47,873
Or, <i>as</i> he was once
called, The Dark Horse.

294
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:50,039
- Dark Pony!
- Nice hair, bro!

295
00:25:50,156 --> 00:25:51,910
Thank you very much, Rip.
Thank you very much.

296
00:25:52,031 --> 00:25:53,831
We're gonna do some
quick introductions,

297
00:25:54,572 --> 00:25:55,828
and when I say quick, I mean quick.

298
00:25:55,947 --> 00:25:57,747
So, Jedi, you want to kick us off, bro?

299
00:25:58,196 --> 00:25:59,618
<i>Kia or a, bro.</i>

300
00:25:59,738 --> 00:26:00,910
I'm Jedi.

301
00:26:01,071 --> 00:26:02,908
- The Stallion.
- The gelding.

302
00:26:03,029 --> 00:26:04,155
I'm the club DJ here,

303
00:26:04,279 --> 00:26:06,195
so if you got any requests,
send them this way.

304
00:26:06,237 --> 00:26:08,737
Even if I was 40 years old,
I wouldn't listen to your shit.

305
00:26:09,569 --> 00:26:10,612
Now, stop it.

306
00:26:11,652 --> 00:26:14,070
And my special power would be...

307
00:26:14,194 --> 00:26:15,485
- No.
- ...ladies' man.

308
00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:17,862
- No special power.
- I want a special power.

309
00:26:17,985 --> 00:26:20,995
All right, you can have one.
Everyone can have one special power.

310
00:26:21,109 --> 00:26:22,614
<i>Kia or a, bro!</i>

311
00:26:22,776 --> 00:26:24,032
I'm Rusty,

312
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:28,108
and my special power will be
to jump to the moon and colonize it.

313
00:26:28,233 --> 00:26:30,318
<i>- Kia or a.
- Kia or a, Rusty.</i>

314
00:26:31,399 --> 00:26:32,609
I'm Piripi.

315
00:26:34,899 --> 00:26:37,115
I don't really have a special power.

316
00:26:37,273 --> 00:26:38,944
- Come on.
- I'm Rangimarie.

317
00:26:39,065 --> 00:26:40,451
I'm from Awapuni,

318
00:26:40,565 --> 00:26:43,361
and if I had a superpower,
it would be to fly to America,

319
00:26:43,481 --> 00:26:46,147
meet Usher, bring him back to Gizzy,
and make him have my babies.

320
00:26:46,189 --> 00:26:47,231
<i>HEY-</i>

321
00:26:47,355 --> 00:26:48,897
- You'd have his babies.
- Cut it out.

322
00:26:48,938 --> 00:26:53,240
My name is Murray. If I had a superpower,
it would be invisible and super strength.

323
00:26:53,354 --> 00:26:55,404
- Can only have one.
- No, only one.

324
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,860
Fine, I pick super strength.

325
00:26:56,979 --> 00:26:59,693
I'm Nathan. My special power
would be playing music.

326
00:26:59,853 --> 00:27:00,896
<i>Kia or a, bro.</i>

327
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:02,690
- My name's Rip.
- Rip!

328
00:27:02,811 --> 00:27:04,565
And if I had a superpower,

329
00:27:04,686 --> 00:27:08,312
I'd have to go with being
like Tumatauenga, the god of <i>war,</i>

330
00:27:08,435 --> 00:27:11,066
so I can, like, beat all you fellas up,
smash you all.

331
00:27:11,185 --> 00:27:12,524
Yeah. Kia or a. Thank you.
Thank you, now.

332
00:27:12,643 --> 00:27:15,143
- I'm talking, bro.
- You can't smash me, I'll smash you.

333
00:27:15,267 --> 00:27:17,270
- Sit down. Sit down.
- Kia or a, Gen.

334
00:27:17,392 --> 00:27:18,518
<i>Kia or a.</i>

335
00:27:18,642 --> 00:27:20,443
I'm Sandy,

336
00:27:20,558 --> 00:27:24,564
and I'm gonna get the invisibility
that Murray gave away

337
00:27:24,807 --> 00:27:27,687
so that I can hide from all of you
when you talk too much.

338
00:27:29,723 --> 00:27:30,765
Especially you!

339
00:27:30,848 --> 00:27:31,974
- Whatever! You love us!
- I got a special power.

340
00:27:32,098 --> 00:27:35,143
My special power is, I'm the milky man.

341
00:27:38,305 --> 00:27:40,639
All right! All right.

342
00:27:41,638 --> 00:27:42,680
And lastly...

343
00:27:44,596 --> 00:27:49,763
Hi, everyone.
I am of the Te Aitanga-a-Hauiti clan.

344
00:27:53,345 --> 00:27:55,394
My name is Genesis Potini.

345
00:27:57,136 --> 00:27:58,345
And...

346
00:27:58,594 --> 00:28:01,011
My special powers, yes.

347
00:28:01,135 --> 00:28:02,806
Yes, yes, yes.

348
00:28:09,009 --> 00:28:11,142
I'm gonna lead you all

349
00:28:11,258 --> 00:28:15,097
to the National Chess Championships
up in Auckland

350
00:28:15,216 --> 00:28:17,515
in six weeks' time!

351
00:28:24,548 --> 00:28:25,934
Outside.

352
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:32,922
Nobes...

353
00:28:33,005 --> 00:28:34,640
Gen, what are you doing?

354
00:28:34,755 --> 00:28:36,390
Positivity. Wait, wait!

355
00:28:36,504 --> 00:28:37,974
I'm trying to give
them some positivity.

356
00:28:38,087 --> 00:28:41,049
- They've already got something positive.
- No, that's not...

357
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:43,303
They don't even have
decent chess sets, cuz.

358
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:44,462
Gen, listen to me.

359
00:28:44,586 --> 00:28:48,011
I have thought about this,
and I know it will work.

360
00:28:48,127 --> 00:28:49,597
- You thought about it?
- Yes.

361
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:51,050
- Thought about them?
- Yes, yes.

362
00:28:51,169 --> 00:28:52,460
Who you just met tonight?

363
00:28:52,585 --> 00:28:55,346
Who you don't even know
whether they can even play!

364
00:28:56,251 --> 00:28:57,507
Yeah.

365
00:28:57,626 --> 00:28:59,261
Gen!

366
00:29:00,375 --> 00:29:02,343
I can help them.

367
00:29:02,458 --> 00:29:03,631
They'll have a purpose.

368
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:07,174
They need a purpose, a focus.

369
00:29:07,291 --> 00:29:08,333
Who knows what'll happen?

370
00:29:08,707 --> 00:29:11,089
I know what will happen.

371
00:29:11,207 --> 00:29:14,834
You'll rev them up
with some new and exciting idea,

372
00:29:14,956 --> 00:29:18,713
then you're gonna go off the rails,
and we're not gonna see you again.

373
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:22,796
They don't need some big,
delusional tournament.

374
00:29:23,538 --> 00:29:25,872
They don't even have parents.

375
00:29:25,996 --> 00:29:29,172
Just fuckin' gangs and jails.
They're not even around.

376
00:29:30,412 --> 00:29:33,339
They need people
who are gonna show up, Gen.

377
00:29:34,745 --> 00:29:36,167
Stability!

378
00:29:36,661 --> 00:29:38,581
- Cuz...
- Go!

379
00:29:43,285 --> 00:29:44,494
Shut up, everyone!

380
00:29:47,868 --> 00:29:48,958
No rocking the boat.

381
00:29:49,284 --> 00:29:51,453
Not supposed to... Don't rock the boat!

382
00:30:25,653 --> 00:30:27,040
<i>Nana'?</i>

383
00:30:41,234 --> 00:30:43,403
Where's he been tonight?

384
00:30:49,691 --> 00:30:52,536
You think you're his
fuckin' mummy now, eh?

385
00:30:59,065 --> 00:31:00,949
Fuckin' retard.

386
00:31:26,269 --> 00:31:28,946
You fuckin' pisshead, eh?

387
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:31,193
Too much!

388
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:32,482
<i>You want a sash, man'!?</i>

389
00:31:32,601 --> 00:31:34,438
You want a drink, you soft cock?

390
00:31:36,975 --> 00:31:38,943
Come on, sis.

391
00:32:01,846 --> 00:32:02,888
<i>ATM'?</i>

392
00:32:05,846 --> 00:32:07,683
Beer, bro?

393
00:32:07,804 --> 00:32:09,356
No. No, no.

394
00:32:25,259 --> 00:32:27,807
I know things have been hard on you,
my bro.

395
00:32:30,009 --> 00:32:31,809
Been hard on me, too.

396
00:32:33,008 --> 00:32:34,347
You understand?

397
00:32:38,965 --> 00:32:40,138
Mutt...

398
00:32:42,048 --> 00:32:43,683
He said you took Mana out last night.

399
00:32:44,881 --> 00:32:47,014
No, he followed me, bro.

400
00:32:51,338 --> 00:32:53,388
I don't want it happening again.

401
00:32:54,796 --> 00:32:57,806
He's got to be a man
now, got to be strong.

402
00:32:59,545 --> 00:33:01,678
I can't have you messing with his head.

403
00:33:01,795 --> 00:33:03,514
No, I would never do that, bro.

404
00:33:03,628 --> 00:33:06,306
That's the last thing I want.

405
00:33:18,917 --> 00:33:20,967
That's 1,000 bucks, bro.

406
00:33:22,458 --> 00:33:23,928
Go and get a place of your own.

407
00:33:25,125 --> 00:33:27,590
No. What about the ward, bro?

408
00:33:27,708 --> 00:33:30,208
I'll tell the ward what
you want 'em to know.

409
00:33:31,290 --> 00:33:33,708
As long as you respect
what I'm asking, bro.

410
00:33:49,954 --> 00:33:51,625
Get on the dole.

411
00:33:52,787 --> 00:33:54,624
Start your own life.

412
00:33:55,953 --> 00:33:58,915
I can't do anything more for you now,
my brother.

413
00:34:15,325 --> 00:34:17,375
When I <i>was</i> really sick...

414
00:34:19,991 --> 00:34:21,792
I'd see you.

415
00:34:22,990 --> 00:34:25,159
Back when we were little kids.

416
00:34:26,948 --> 00:34:30,326
You'd put your hand on my shoulder,
and you'd say,

417
00:34:30,448 --> 00:34:32,581
“We'll be all right, bro.

418
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:36,739
“Everything will be alright."

419
00:34:54,985 --> 00:34:56,620
You're gonna be all right, eh?

420
00:34:56,735 --> 00:35:00,492
You're gonna just buy me out
just like that, eh?

421
00:35:00,609 --> 00:35:02,161
That's how it's gonna be, man.

422
00:35:02,276 --> 00:35:03,697
You think that's good?

423
00:35:03,817 --> 00:35:07,739
That's how you want to do it?
That's how you want to leave it?

424
00:35:08,316 --> 00:35:10,035
I just have to find a purpose.

425
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:15,281
A traitor? A Judas? Why?
What was it about?

426
00:36:15,889 --> 00:36:17,690
Michael!

427
00:36:21,221 --> 00:36:24,267
You want to go inside, bro?
We gonna start soon.

428
00:36:28,179 --> 00:36:30,513
Fella won some local school comp.

429
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,557
Cleaned them all up.

430
00:36:33,636 --> 00:36:35,935
Then tried to burn down the school.

431
00:36:37,427 --> 00:36:40,520
I told his parole officer
that we're going to this...

432
00:36:40,635 --> 00:36:42,389
This tournament.

433
00:36:42,551 --> 00:36:44,768
Be like his community service.

434
00:36:45,593 --> 00:36:47,062
They went for it.

435
00:36:51,883 --> 00:36:55,426
Gen, you probably think
I'm being some big arsehole.

436
00:36:57,007 --> 00:37:00,800
But you talk dreams to those kids,
you better follow through.

437
00:37:01,673 --> 00:37:04,600
Take your meds, get
your sleep, whatever.

438
00:37:05,923 --> 00:37:10,141
Just promise me
that you're looking after yourself.

439
00:37:10,255 --> 00:37:13,597
Promise me you won't let 'em down.

440
00:37:16,296 --> 00:37:17,505
Promise.

441
00:37:22,545 --> 00:37:26,503
So, gear...
I figure we...

442
00:37:29,211 --> 00:37:30,632
What are those?

443
00:37:42,583 --> 00:37:45,166
Just be careful with them, please.
We just got them!

444
00:37:45,291 --> 00:37:48,136
Come on, at least let
them last the night.

445
00:37:48,249 --> 00:37:49,291
Nice one, bro.

446
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:52,212
Michael, can you help Piripi, please?

447
00:37:52,332 --> 00:37:53,422
Thank you.

448
00:37:55,081 --> 00:37:56,421
Be careful with them, eh?

449
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:59,005
Don't want to be like Noble
and end up in no-man's-land.

450
00:37:59,122 --> 00:38:00,165
Someone stole our pawns!

451
00:38:00,289 --> 00:38:01,841
Must have been Usher.

452
00:38:01,955 --> 00:38:04,207
Not even funny, bloody Jedi.

453
00:38:04,372 --> 00:38:06,042
Stop with the fuckin' old music!

454
00:38:10,704 --> 00:38:12,292
Hey, hey! Look here.

455
00:38:13,162 --> 00:38:14,584
Good evening, team.

456
00:38:16,870 --> 00:38:17,911
Rusty!

457
00:38:17,994 --> 00:38:19,879
As members of Eastern Knights,

458
00:38:20,244 --> 00:38:23,503
you belong to a very special family,

459
00:38:23,619 --> 00:38:25,207
which means...

460
00:38:34,242 --> 00:38:35,498
- Oh, man!
- Awesome!

461
00:38:37,283 --> 00:38:38,918
You will each be represented

462
00:38:40,116 --> 00:38:42,533
by a warrior on this board.

463
00:38:44,157 --> 00:38:46,409
You're to keep it with you at all times

464
00:38:47,156 --> 00:38:49,289
<i>as a kaitiaki, or guardian.</i>

465
00:38:49,864 --> 00:38:51,369
At practise, you return it here,

466
00:38:51,697 --> 00:38:53,249
back to the board,

467
00:38:53,364 --> 00:38:54,952
to reunite us all <i>as</i> a family.

468
00:38:55,072 --> 00:38:56,114
Okay?

469
00:38:56,238 --> 00:38:57,280
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

470
00:38:57,363 --> 00:38:58,489
Line up, then.

471
00:39:00,696 --> 00:39:01,738
Wail. Wait.

472
00:39:01,862 --> 00:39:06,578
Before you get your sticky, dirty little
fingers on these beautiful pieces...

473
00:39:08,236 --> 00:39:12,740
I think there's one that needs to
be handed out first, don't you?

474
00:39:16,693 --> 00:39:18,198
King for a king, eh?

475
00:39:21,234 --> 00:39:22,277
What do you all think?

476
00:39:22,401 --> 00:39:23,574
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

477
00:39:23,692 --> 00:39:24,734
Yeah, of course.

478
00:39:27,942 --> 00:39:32,160
All right, now, think about who you
are, all the good things about you.

479
00:39:32,274 --> 00:39:33,317
Pick a piece.

480
00:39:34,191 --> 00:39:35,779
Come on.

481
00:39:35,899 --> 00:39:37,569
Nice one, Rip.

482
00:39:43,439 --> 00:39:44,530
Thanks, Gen.

483
00:39:51,438 --> 00:39:53,073
Thanks, Gen. Mean.

484
00:39:59,437 --> 00:40:02,281
I think I'm gonna take this
because I deserve him.

485
00:40:02,394 --> 00:40:03,520
And... Yeah.

486
00:40:03,644 --> 00:40:05,232
Thanks, Gen.

487
00:40:08,227 --> 00:40:11,604
Thank you, Genesis,
for giving me this beautiful...

488
00:40:11,726 --> 00:40:13,563
- Rook.
- ...rook.

489
00:40:19,767 --> 00:40:23,642
Next week, you're all going to be
learning chess notation.

490
00:40:23,933 --> 00:40:26,184
Who knows what that means?

491
00:40:26,307 --> 00:40:28,559
You got to write down
where you move your pieces?

492
00:40:28,682 --> 00:40:29,772
That's exactly what it means.

493
00:40:29,890 --> 00:40:34,393
You have to write down your moves,
where your pieces end up on the board.

494
00:40:34,514 --> 00:40:37,607
Now, see, I have my little notebook,
and I make chess notation.

495
00:40:37,722 --> 00:40:39,013
See that, see the knight there?

496
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:40,222
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

497
00:40:40,305 --> 00:40:42,983
I take two steps closer to...

498
00:40:43,096 --> 00:40:44,518
Angry Noble!

499
00:40:49,054 --> 00:40:50,440
And where does Angry Noble go?

500
00:40:50,553 --> 00:40:51,679
His milk truck!

501
00:40:51,803 --> 00:40:53,012
Very funny.

502
00:40:53,136 --> 00:40:54,890
His milk truck. Awesome!

503
00:40:55,011 --> 00:40:58,519
And his milk truck is parked at E3.
How do I know that is E3?

504
00:40:58,635 --> 00:41:00,555
A, B, C, D, E.

505
00:41:00,677 --> 00:41:02,265
One, two, three... E3.

506
00:41:02,676 --> 00:41:04,312
- Rank.
- Rank and file.

507
00:41:04,426 --> 00:41:08,016
Easy. All right, now, what move
should black make next?

508
00:41:09,134 --> 00:41:10,175
Manihera?

509
00:41:17,424 --> 00:41:19,059
Bro, I'll give you a game, eh?

510
00:41:19,924 --> 00:41:21,345
Whatever.

511
00:41:24,131 --> 00:41:25,802
All right. How about...

512
00:41:27,672 --> 00:41:29,426
Look.

513
00:41:29,547 --> 00:41:31,182
Jedi the Stallion.

514
00:41:46,419 --> 00:41:47,461
Checkmate again.

515
00:41:48,294 --> 00:41:49,336
Sorry, bro.

516
00:41:51,169 --> 00:41:52,210
Good game, my bro.

517
00:41:53,002 --> 00:41:56,426
Looks like we got another Dark Horse
in our midst, eh?

518
00:41:56,543 --> 00:41:59,008
What Dark Horse? Him?

519
00:41:59,792 --> 00:42:01,667
- Didn't you go crazy or something?
- Michael.

520
00:42:06,125 --> 00:42:07,166
You made a mistake.

521
00:42:08,083 --> 00:42:09,718
What, winning?

522
00:42:11,290 --> 00:42:13,756
You could've got checkmate
about six moves earlier.

523
00:42:14,415 --> 00:42:15,540
This fella for real, Noble?

524
00:42:17,623 --> 00:42:18,713
Let me see.

525
00:42:26,455 --> 00:42:28,043
So, you were here.

526
00:42:28,454 --> 00:42:30,125
- Yeah.
- Pretty much it, right?

527
00:42:30,246 --> 00:42:31,834
And then he moved his queen here.

528
00:42:31,954 --> 00:42:34,501
So, queen takes queen, C3.
That's the best move.

529
00:42:34,662 --> 00:42:35,871
That's what I did.

530
00:42:36,703 --> 00:42:38,670
Try this one. See?

531
00:42:40,244 --> 00:42:42,626
See, you just lost your queen, bro.

532
00:42:42,744 --> 00:42:44,960
No wonder they call you crazy.

533
00:42:46,035 --> 00:42:47,077
Take the queen, Noble.

534
00:42:53,242 --> 00:42:54,498
Checkmate.

535
00:42:56,075 --> 00:42:58,492
See? Be crazy.

536
00:42:59,074 --> 00:43:01,954
- Burn the school down.
- Don't burn the school down.

537
00:43:02,074 --> 00:43:03,413
Burn the school down!

538
00:43:03,532 --> 00:43:05,250
Don't burn the school down!

539
00:43:11,864 --> 00:43:13,073
Burn the school down!

540
00:43:15,405 --> 00:43:19,623
All right, all right, all right.
Everybody, go to your own tables.

541
00:43:19,738 --> 00:43:22,700
Put those back.
Put that back, please, Murray.

542
00:43:22,862 --> 00:43:24,248
Get outta here, man!

543
00:43:25,112 --> 00:43:27,115
Please do not burn down the school.

544
00:43:27,237 --> 00:43:28,825
Crazy little midgets.

545
00:43:28,986 --> 00:43:31,617
Only on the board.
Okay, great, come on.

546
00:43:33,902 --> 00:43:34,945
Go again?

547
00:43:39,026 --> 00:43:42,783
- I can choose what I want!
- What did your parents teach you?

548
00:43:43,942 --> 00:43:45,613
Hurry up, eh...

549
00:43:45,942 --> 00:43:49,117
- Fine. I spy with my little...
- Big eye.

550
00:43:49,233 --> 00:43:52,906
- Big eye.
- ...my big eye something that's green.

551
00:43:53,024 --> 00:43:54,410
- Are you dumb?
- I ain't dumb.

552
00:43:54,524 --> 00:43:56,242
Supposed to be a letter,
not a bloody colour!

553
00:43:56,357 --> 00:43:57,826
I can choose a colour if I want!

554
00:43:57,940 --> 00:43:59,445
- Well, then, grass.
- You have wonderful children.

555
00:43:59,565 --> 00:44:01,235
- No! No! No!
- Yeah! Yeah! Shut up!

556
00:44:01,356 --> 00:44:02,778
Yes, it is,
'cause she's my next-door neighbour.

557
00:44:02,897 --> 00:44:04,983
Thanks.

558
00:44:05,105 --> 00:44:09,111
Mum, can Gen come in when we get home?

559
00:44:09,271 --> 00:44:11,239
I think Gen's got his own stuff
to do tonight, hon.

560
00:44:11,354 --> 00:44:12,943
- Yeah!
- Okay.

561
00:44:13,646 --> 00:44:15,944
- Thank you, though.
- Shut up!

562
00:44:16,062 --> 00:44:18,029
- Said number 10, right?
- You shut up!

563
00:44:18,145 --> 00:44:20,230
- Is this it?
- Yes, yes, yes.

564
00:44:20,353 --> 00:44:22,356
- I can kick your arse.
- I can kick you!

565
00:44:23,186 --> 00:44:24,691
Bro, your leg's down there, Murray.

566
00:44:24,852 --> 00:44:26,404
Nice place.

567
00:44:26,519 --> 00:44:28,273
See you tomorrow then.

568
00:44:28,393 --> 00:44:30,029
See you tomorrow.

569
00:44:30,143 --> 00:44:31,269
BYE, Gen!

570
00:44:31,393 --> 00:44:32,434
- Bye.
- Bye, Gen.

571
00:44:32,518 --> 00:44:34,769
You hold onto those pieces,
all right, you kids?

572
00:44:34,892 --> 00:44:36,101
- Yeah.
- Thanks for the lift.

573
00:44:36,184 --> 00:44:37,653
- Bye.
- Good night.

574
00:44:39,308 --> 00:44:40,778
BYE, Gen!

575
00:46:00,170 --> 00:46:01,924
<i>We a“ know who Maui is, eh'?</i>

576
00:46:02,045 --> 00:46:04,427
<i>- He's one of our ancestors, eh'?
- Yeah.</i>

577
00:46:04,545 --> 00:46:06,796
<i>And one day he went fishing.</i>

578
00:46:06,919 --> 00:46:08,128
He had this magic fishhook.

579
00:46:08,252 --> 00:46:11,346
He threw it over the side,
and then something bit.

580
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:14,305
He <i>was</i> like, “That's a bit heavy.

581
00:46:14,418 --> 00:46:16,172
“Can't pull that up all on my own."

582
00:46:16,293 --> 00:46:19,386
So, because he was a leader
of his people, like this king,

583
00:46:19,501 --> 00:46:23,174
Maui, he went and got
all of his family, just like us,

584
00:46:23,292 --> 00:46:25,176
just like all these
pieces on this board,

585
00:46:25,291 --> 00:46:26,382
they come together,

586
00:46:26,499 --> 00:46:30,256
and they pulled and they pulled
and they pulled up land.

587
00:46:30,915 --> 00:46:33,877
And that land is the land
we all live on now, eh?

588
00:46:33,998 --> 00:46:36,546
- New Zealand?
- That's us.

589
00:46:36,665 --> 00:46:40,089
And that board there,
the kingdom for this king,

590
00:46:40,206 --> 00:46:41,592
that board is like our land.

591
00:46:41,705 --> 00:46:43,673
We have to protect our land, eh?

592
00:46:43,788 --> 00:46:47,083
And we do that
by all working together with our king.

593
00:46:47,204 --> 00:46:52,253
Now, if we lose our king, Maui,
game over, no more game,

594
00:46:52,370 --> 00:46:55,250
'cause he got the magic,
so we have to protect him.

595
00:46:55,370 --> 00:46:59,127
Now, the one last thing about Maui,
our king,

596
00:46:59,286 --> 00:47:02,663
is he has to carry that responsibility,
and it's very heavy.

597
00:47:02,785 --> 00:47:05,712
So, it slows him down,
and he can only move

598
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:08,791
one square at a time.

599
00:47:45,445 --> 00:47:47,246
<i>Nana'?</i>

600
00:47:47,528 --> 00:47:48,820
Mafia.

601
00:47:55,985 --> 00:47:57,739
What are you doing here?

602
00:48:03,942 --> 00:48:05,945
I've got a present for you.

603
00:48:12,024 --> 00:48:14,607
Found it in our house.

604
00:48:14,732 --> 00:48:15,899
I thought you might want it.

605
00:48:26,439 --> 00:48:27,944
You followed me here?

606
00:48:34,021 --> 00:48:36,189
You can't be here, Mana.

607
00:48:41,686 --> 00:48:43,156
Does your father know you're here?

608
00:48:46,852 --> 00:48:50,561
He knows
that you came to our practise.

609
00:48:55,059 --> 00:48:56,978
Are youse going to a tournament?

610
00:48:57,642 --> 00:48:58,933
How did you know that?

611
00:49:08,765 --> 00:49:13,932
I know you think I'd be shit at chess, but
that's just 'cause nobody's taught me.

612
00:49:16,181 --> 00:49:18,148
Maybe I could be all right.

613
00:49:22,513 --> 00:49:24,729
Maybe I could play in your tournament.

614
00:49:26,721 --> 00:49:28,356
Oh, boy.

615
00:49:35,719 --> 00:49:38,018
You have to go.

616
00:49:38,135 --> 00:49:39,806
<i>Nana, I'm sorry.</i>

617
00:49:41,093 --> 00:49:43,345
Fuck it, then! Whatever!

618
00:49:43,468 --> 00:49:45,222
You're just scared!

619
00:49:45,343 --> 00:49:47,262
Fuckin' bullshit anyway!

620
00:52:39,856 --> 00:52:42,902
This is way better than Noble's garage!

621
00:53:12,393 --> 00:53:15,189
All right, you kids, listen up!

622
00:53:21,350 --> 00:53:22,476
Okay-

623
00:53:22,641 --> 00:53:26,101
We need to raise some money if we're
gonna make it to this tournament.

624
00:53:26,516 --> 00:53:30,687
Now, I know all of you
have a special talent,

625
00:53:30,806 --> 00:53:32,726
something that you're good at.

626
00:53:32,848 --> 00:53:34,269
This is what we're gonna do.

627
00:53:34,389 --> 00:53:37,316
We're gonna practise it,
we're gonna make it even better,

628
00:53:37,430 --> 00:53:40,013
and then we're gonna charge people
some big bucks

629
00:53:40,138 --> 00:53:41,180
to come and watch us!

630
00:53:41,930 --> 00:53:43,897
Think about what it is.

631
00:53:44,721 --> 00:53:46,226
What are you gonna do?

632
00:54:14,716 --> 00:54:17,347
You can't sleep up there
any more, all right?

633
00:54:26,256 --> 00:54:27,927
Do you have something Mana could do?

634
00:54:28,047 --> 00:54:29,636
Yeah, of course.

635
00:54:31,463 --> 00:54:33,964
Hey, everyone, say <i>kia</i> or a to Mana.

636
00:54:34,088 --> 00:54:36,636
- Hi, Mana.
- Kia or a, Mana.

637
00:54:38,796 --> 00:54:39,921
Come here.

638
00:54:41,212 --> 00:54:43,179
Go on. Go talk to Sandy.

639
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:47,088
Kia or a. I'm Piripi.

640
00:54:47,253 --> 00:54:49,006
- I'm Rip.
- Cheers.

641
00:54:49,127 --> 00:54:51,710
- Hey, Mana, I'm Nobes.
- I'm Mana.

642
00:54:52,585 --> 00:54:53,877
Jedi.

643
00:54:58,709 --> 00:55:01,470
Okay, show me the next bit.
That's good. What's the next bit?

644
00:55:01,625 --> 00:55:03,675
Like a diamond. But turn around.

645
00:55:03,875 --> 00:55:06,257
Face your audience. Yeah.

646
00:55:08,416 --> 00:55:09,457
Yes!

647
00:55:16,290 --> 00:55:17,380
Yes!

648
00:55:17,498 --> 00:55:19,583
Yeah, this is the story.
This is the story.

649
00:55:19,789 --> 00:55:22,633
Just this old tohunga
that lives up on this cliff.

650
00:55:22,747 --> 00:55:24,169
Do you want to tell the story?

651
00:55:24,288 --> 00:55:25,840
I don't know.

652
00:55:25,955 --> 00:55:27,164
Is it hard?

653
00:55:27,288 --> 00:55:29,255
No, no, you just read it off the paper.

654
00:55:29,662 --> 00:55:30,835
<i>Who's the tohunga?</i>

655
00:55:30,954 --> 00:55:33,122
- You're the tohunga.
- Yeah, bro, I'm the wisest.

656
00:55:33,287 --> 00:55:35,621
So, I'll be the little Maori boy.

657
00:55:35,745 --> 00:55:38,920
Just kicking back while my whole
village is getting smashed.

658
00:55:39,036 --> 00:55:41,003
We got to step up our game right now.

659
00:55:41,119 --> 00:55:42,589
The battle's not far away.

660
00:55:42,702 --> 00:55:44,539
So, 10 rules.

661
00:55:44,660 --> 00:55:46,745
- Control the centre!
- Right on the centre.

662
00:55:46,868 --> 00:55:48,835
- Rip!
- I can't remember.

663
00:55:49,826 --> 00:55:51,627
- Rusty? Rusty?
- Connect the rooks.

664
00:55:51,742 --> 00:55:52,833
Connect the rooks.

665
00:55:52,950 --> 00:55:54,617
Two rooks together are
stronger than one.

666
00:55:54,658 --> 00:55:55,868
Leave no one behind.

667
00:55:55,992 --> 00:55:59,158
All together, that's where we create the
net. That's how Maui caught the sun.

668
00:55:59,199 --> 00:56:00,290
Okay? Coordinate.

669
00:56:00,408 --> 00:56:02,742
- Rip?
- I still can't remember.

670
00:56:10,864 --> 00:56:12,583
Come on, just like a little preview.

671
00:56:12,697 --> 00:56:15,162
- Nah.
- That's just mean.

672
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:20,364
Rangimarie, give me the coordinates
for the Spanish Square.

673
00:56:20,529 --> 00:56:21,702
<i>CA.</i>

674
00:56:22,029 --> 00:56:23,534
- C4.
- Who told her?

675
00:56:23,654 --> 00:56:26,285
- The Italian Square.
- B5.

676
00:56:26,570 --> 00:56:27,861
- Stand up when you say it.
Stand up, Grumpy.

677
00:56:27,986 --> 00:56:30,617
- The Italian Square.
- B5.

678
00:56:30,736 --> 00:56:31,826
Awesome!

679
00:56:38,985 --> 00:56:42,160
You need to show me
how to beat Michael.

680
00:56:43,567 --> 00:56:46,613
He's very good is Michael.

681
00:56:54,149 --> 00:56:56,650
- Who wants to play some blind chess?
- Yeah!

682
00:56:56,773 --> 00:56:57,983
Cover your eyes.

683
00:56:58,107 --> 00:56:59,446
Now, Jedi.

684
00:56:59,565 --> 00:57:01,034
E2 to E4.

685
00:57:01,148 --> 00:57:02,569
Bishop to D6.

686
00:57:02,689 --> 00:57:04,657
Queen to E4. Checkmate.

687
00:57:04,772 --> 00:57:07,237
Murray, did you fall asleep? Murray!

688
00:57:08,230 --> 00:57:09,521
Murray.

689
00:57:10,188 --> 00:57:11,942
Give us the coordinates.

690
00:57:12,813 --> 00:57:14,364
Knight to B6.

691
00:57:14,479 --> 00:57:15,818
Knight to B6.

692
00:57:15,937 --> 00:57:17,028
Genius.

693
00:57:40,391 --> 00:57:42,857
You can't put him there
unless he's protected.

694
00:57:43,183 --> 00:57:45,399
Now, we've gone over this.

695
00:57:46,266 --> 00:57:47,652
See?

696
00:57:48,474 --> 00:57:49,765
Free.

697
00:57:59,597 --> 00:58:01,730
You're not listening.

698
00:58:01,888 --> 00:58:04,187
I'm just gonna keep on
taking your pieces.

699
00:58:14,636 --> 00:58:16,888
Have you ever been pissed on?

700
00:58:23,218 --> 00:58:25,517
It <i>was</i> in front of all of them.

701
00:58:26,759 --> 00:58:29,473
I just sat there. Couldn't do anything.

702
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:34,183
Listened to him laughing.

703
00:58:41,048 --> 00:58:43,347
I just want to fuckin' kill him.

704
00:59:02,462 --> 00:59:05,009
Why are you sleeping here?

705
00:59:05,170 --> 00:59:08,263
Why aren't you fuckin' sleeping
in a house like everyone else?

706
00:59:09,502 --> 00:59:13,129
Is there something wrong with you,
holding on to all those old clippings?

707
00:59:13,293 --> 00:59:15,047
Are you crazy?

708
00:59:16,584 --> 00:59:18,883
Is that why you need those pills?

709
00:59:26,708 --> 00:59:30,216
Just fuckin' tell me!
Or are you too scared?

710
00:59:51,745 --> 00:59:53,795
When I <i>was</i> a boy...

711
00:59:56,703 --> 00:59:59,168
I was taken to a hospital.

712
01:00:01,702 --> 01:00:03,871
Mental hospital,

713
01:00:03,993 --> 01:00:06,838
'cause they thought there was
something wrong with me.

714
01:00:08,743 --> 01:00:12,879
And the doctors,
they looked at me for a while

715
01:00:14,825 --> 01:00:17,077
and told my family I was sick.

716
01:00:18,658 --> 01:00:20,412
I had to stay.

717
01:00:22,491 --> 01:00:25,785
I didn't see your dad for a long time.

718
01:00:27,573 --> 01:00:29,825
But I kept playing-

719
01:00:29,948 --> 01:00:31,239
Play every day,

720
01:00:31,364 --> 01:00:35,950
dreaming of the day
I'd meet him again and thrash him.

721
01:00:39,488 --> 01:00:45,448
I got out,
won a few local games, tournaments,

722
01:00:46,487 --> 01:00:48,536
beat a few good fellas.

723
01:00:49,528 --> 01:00:52,657
That's when they made
those clippings that you found.

724
01:00:57,110 --> 01:00:58,745
But the stress...

725
01:01:00,276 --> 01:01:02,160
I'd just get sick again.

726
01:01:04,859 --> 01:01:09,409
I had to take those pills
to stop me from getting sick.

727
01:01:17,898 --> 01:01:20,150
Have you thrashed Dad yet?

728
01:01:23,147 --> 01:01:24,617
Not yet.

729
01:01:26,064 --> 01:01:28,908
But you have played
against him though, eh?

730
01:01:29,022 --> 01:01:30,859
Yeah.

731
01:01:30,980 --> 01:01:32,864
He taught me.

732
01:01:39,395 --> 01:01:40,781
Mafia.

733
01:01:41,978 --> 01:01:46,114
You are not what they're
making you think you are.

734
01:02:03,683 --> 01:02:05,022
Here.

735
01:02:18,180 --> 01:02:20,018
King for a king.

736
01:02:34,386 --> 01:02:36,105
A couple of you have come and told me

737
01:02:36,219 --> 01:02:39,846
that you don't think you're gonna be
able to make it up to Auckland.

738
01:02:41,135 --> 01:02:42,687
Now, if your parents

739
01:02:42,801 --> 01:02:45,562
really don't want you to come,
we can't make them.

740
01:02:45,676 --> 01:02:49,184
I'm really sorry, but we can't.

741
01:02:49,300 --> 01:02:51,138
Just keep trying, yeah?

742
01:02:51,258 --> 01:02:53,391
That's all I can say, all right?

743
01:02:53,508 --> 01:02:55,013
The tournament is in a week.

744
01:02:55,466 --> 01:02:57,516
We want as many of you up there
as possible.

745
01:02:57,632 --> 01:02:59,386
A week? What day?

746
01:02:59,507 --> 01:03:00,798
Next weekend.

747
01:03:13,296 --> 01:03:15,762
Okay, so, we got to
knuckle in here, yeah?

748
01:03:15,879 --> 01:03:16,420
Be strong... Be courageous...
Get out there and do your best.

749
01:03:16,421 --> 01:03:18,921
Be strong... Be courageous...
Get out there and do your best.

750
01:03:18,962 --> 01:03:20,005
Get into it.

751
01:03:20,129 --> 01:03:22,629
Mana, where you going?

752
01:03:23,836 --> 01:03:26,218
You should have fuckin' told me.

753
01:03:26,336 --> 01:03:28,137
What?

754
01:03:28,252 --> 01:03:30,385
That's my fuckin' birthday.

755
01:03:31,835 --> 01:03:34,300
That's when I'm getting
fuckin' patched!

756
01:03:38,417 --> 01:03:40,053
I'm sorry.

757
01:03:40,167 --> 01:03:41,507
I'm sorry.

758
01:03:57,748 --> 01:04:00,130
It's okay. Carry on.

759
01:04:00,247 --> 01:04:01,290
It's fine.

760
01:04:01,414 --> 01:04:04,045
Okay, let's give her
another little clap.

761
01:04:04,163 --> 01:04:07,541
Good girl. Now take a bow.
You go sit down. Good girl.

762
01:04:07,663 --> 01:04:09,333
Who's gonna come up next?

763
01:04:58,155 --> 01:04:59,494
Yeah?

764
01:05:09,153 --> 01:05:11,784
'Bout time you came
round for a visit, eh?

765
01:05:33,107 --> 01:05:34,991
I was havin' this dream.

766
01:05:37,523 --> 01:05:40,782
You and I were playing
down by the creek like we used to.

767
01:05:42,814 --> 01:05:44,615
You were drowning.

768
01:05:44,731 --> 01:05:46,780
And I'd reach out.

769
01:05:46,939 --> 01:05:49,320
And then you'd jump up,

770
01:05:49,438 --> 01:05:52,400
and I'd realise you were
playing a joke on me.

771
01:06:03,936 --> 01:06:05,985
What you lookin' so serious about?

772
01:06:06,727 --> 01:06:08,279
Nothing.

773
01:06:10,810 --> 01:06:12,694
Ward called.

774
01:06:12,893 --> 01:06:13,935
I told 'em you're so healthy,

775
01:06:14,059 --> 01:06:17,021
they must have got the wrong fella
in the first place.

776
01:06:17,767 --> 01:06:18,809
They liked that.

777
01:06:18,933 --> 01:06:20,569
Thank you, my bro.

778
01:06:26,807 --> 01:06:28,359
Was I wrong?

779
01:06:28,932 --> 01:06:30,437
No.

780
01:06:31,265 --> 01:06:32,734
No.

781
01:06:37,222 --> 01:06:40,812
I need to talk to you
about something, Ariki.

782
01:06:40,930 --> 01:06:42,399
You in trouble?

783
01:06:43,388 --> 01:06:44,774
No.

784
01:06:48,595 --> 01:06:49,721
When I got out of the <i>ward,</i>

785
01:06:49,845 --> 01:06:53,435
they told me I have to find
something positive to focus on,

786
01:06:53,553 --> 01:06:56,267
and, well, I found something.

787
01:06:57,844 --> 01:07:00,806
It's a club. Chess club.

788
01:07:01,218 --> 01:07:03,766
For kids. And...

789
01:07:06,009 --> 01:07:09,268
I'm taking them to this tournament
in Auckland.

790
01:07:09,384 --> 01:07:11,184
They might lose,

791
01:07:12,633 --> 01:07:15,181
but at least it's something
I can do for them, eh?

792
01:07:15,799 --> 01:07:18,761
Something different, positive.

793
01:07:20,923 --> 01:07:22,973
I was thinking maybe...

794
01:07:26,298 --> 01:07:28,466
Maybe Mana could come, too.

795
01:07:30,714 --> 01:07:32,763
Maybe he'd enjoy it.

796
01:07:38,129 --> 01:07:40,890
Pretty hard
if he doesn't know how to play, eh?

797
01:07:44,628 --> 01:07:46,098
He does.

798
01:07:50,085 --> 01:07:52,668
I'm not saying he's gonna win
or nothing, but...

799
01:07:55,501 --> 01:07:57,469
It's next weekend.

800
01:07:58,709 --> 01:08:01,091
The tournament, it's next weekend.

801
01:08:10,124 --> 01:08:11,380
Get out.

802
01:08:12,082 --> 01:08:13,800
Wait. Wait a minute.

803
01:08:13,915 --> 01:08:18,714
Behind my back, both of youse,
after I asked you.

804
01:08:18,831 --> 01:08:21,083
No, it wasn't like that, bro.
I wanted to tell you about it.

805
01:08:21,205 --> 01:08:22,248
- I wanted to ask you...
- About what?

806
01:08:22,372 --> 01:08:25,133
About you knowing
what's best for my boy?

807
01:08:26,288 --> 01:08:28,540
'Cause you got some fuckin' chess club?

808
01:08:30,412 --> 01:08:32,878
Fuck up his chances with the brothers?

809
01:08:32,995 --> 01:08:34,832
No, it wasn't like that.

810
01:08:37,078 --> 01:08:40,538
You think some kids' game's
gonna solve all his problems?

811
01:08:40,661 --> 01:08:43,505
Off to some weekend tournament.

812
01:08:43,619 --> 01:08:45,586
And what, happy endings?

813
01:08:46,701 --> 01:08:47,827
And then what?

814
01:08:48,451 --> 01:08:51,082
You gonna raise him, feed him,

815
01:08:51,201 --> 01:08:53,417
stay out of your nuthouse
long enough for that?

816
01:08:53,534 --> 01:08:55,702
'Course you fuckin' ain't.

817
01:08:57,366 --> 01:09:00,328
Dump him right back here, and then
fuck off back where you came from.

818
01:09:01,199 --> 01:09:03,581
Wait, wait. Stop, please.
Just stop a second.

819
01:09:03,699 --> 01:09:05,784
I don't want take him from you. Okay?

820
01:09:05,907 --> 01:09:09,497
I just want to give him a chance to
see something out there in the world.

821
01:09:09,614 --> 01:09:11,368
There ain't nothing out there for him!

822
01:09:13,989 --> 01:09:15,659
World don't want him.

823
01:09:17,488 --> 01:09:19,822
Didn't want me, and sure as
fuck didn't want you, did it?

824
01:09:21,612 --> 01:09:23,994
He lives in my world,
the real fuckin' world.

825
01:09:24,112 --> 01:09:26,992
Look, I didn't want this. I'm sorry.
I didn't want it to be like this.

826
01:09:27,112 --> 01:09:29,695
Come here telling me fuckin' stories.

827
01:09:31,194 --> 01:09:33,576
Remember my hand on your shoulder,
do you?

828
01:09:34,610 --> 01:09:36,862
Telling you things will be all right?

829
01:09:37,610 --> 01:09:41,153
Well, nobody had theirfuckin' hand
on mine, bro.

830
01:09:41,776 --> 01:09:44,323
No one told me shit'd be all right.

831
01:09:45,567 --> 01:09:47,570
I've been alone with nothing.

832
01:09:48,483 --> 01:09:50,320
But I stayed fuckin' standing.

833
01:09:50,441 --> 01:09:53,487
When you fell all apart,
I stayed fuckin' standing,

834
01:09:53,607 --> 01:09:55,112
and so will he.

835
01:09:55,232 --> 01:09:57,152
And I ain't gonna let you fuck that up.

836
01:09:57,273 --> 01:10:00,235
I don't want to fuck anything up, bro.

837
01:10:00,356 --> 01:10:04,693
But he is being pissed on.
Pissed on and beat up by Mutt.

838
01:10:06,064 --> 01:10:08,280
And you're his father.
You should be protecting him.

839
01:10:08,397 --> 01:10:10,944
Damn fuckin' right I'm his father!
You think I don't know?

840
01:10:11,896 --> 01:10:14,858
You think I didn't go
through the same fuckin' shit?

841
01:10:20,686 --> 01:10:22,985
That's the real world.

842
01:10:23,103 --> 01:10:24,821
That's the shit
the rest of us have to deal with

843
01:10:24,936 --> 01:10:26,560
while you just take your fuckin' pills.

844
01:10:28,893 --> 01:10:30,149
Ariki, please.

845
01:10:30,268 --> 01:10:32,184
- Get out.
- Please, just listen to me. Just...

846
01:10:32,268 --> 01:10:33,441
You got 10 fuckin' seconds.

847
01:10:33,559 --> 01:10:35,194
No, please, listen to me. Just...

848
01:10:35,309 --> 01:10:37,146
No, just listen to...
I'm just asking you for a week.

849
01:10:37,267 --> 01:10:39,100
- Five!
- No, it doesn't make any sense, man.

850
01:10:39,183 --> 01:10:40,570
Why can't you just give him a week, eh?

851
01:10:40,683 --> 01:10:42,641
- Two!
- That's all I'm asking is just one week.

852
01:10:43,141 --> 01:10:44,646
A week!

853
01:10:44,766 --> 01:10:47,231
I'm just asking, why can't you give him
one more week?

854
01:10:47,349 --> 01:10:50,394
'Cause I ain't got one
more fuckin' week!

855
01:10:54,598 --> 01:10:57,015
You fuckin' blind, bro?

856
01:11:10,470 --> 01:11:12,141
What are you talking about?

857
01:11:18,260 --> 01:11:21,638
Just get out.

858
01:11:43,881 --> 01:11:46,891
'There's nothing for him out there.
They have nothing for him out there.

859
01:11:47,006 --> 01:11:49,637
“The world doesn't want you.
It doesn't want me.

860
01:11:49,755 --> 01:11:52,303
“You gonna raise him?
You gonna feed him?

861
01:11:52,422 --> 01:11:54,057
“That's what you gonna do?

862
01:11:54,838 --> 01:11:56,343
“'Cause I haven't got a week."

863
01:11:56,463 --> 01:11:58,548
“Why can't you give him a week?"
"I haven't got a week."

864
01:11:58,671 --> 01:12:00,720
“Why can't you just give him one week?

865
01:12:00,837 --> 01:12:02,253
“We're just talking about a week."

866
01:12:02,337 --> 01:12:06,804
"Yeah, just go on. Get out. Get out.
Told ya to just get out. Just get out."

867
01:12:08,044 --> 01:12:11,634
Got to stay positive.
Got to stay positive.

868
01:12:12,460 --> 01:12:14,131
<i>Just get it together.</i>

869
01:12:14,251 --> 01:12:15,543
<i>Say something.</i>

870
01:12:15,668 --> 01:12:17,635
<i>Say something positive.</i>

871
01:12:17,834 --> 01:12:19,553
<i>There is nothing positive.</i>

872
01:12:20,584 --> 01:12:22,219
<i>Only positive.</i>

873
01:12:23,583 --> 01:12:25,218
Get it together, boy.

874
01:12:25,375 --> 01:12:27,045
<i>Positive.</i>

875
01:12:27,249 --> 01:12:30,010
<i>Come on, now. Come on.</i>

876
01:12:33,832 --> 01:12:35,632
<i>You can do this. You got it.</i>

877
01:12:35,748 --> 01:12:37,502
<i>You got it. You got it.</i>

878
01:12:38,456 --> 01:12:39,925
<i>You can do it.</i>

879
01:12:42,164 --> 01:12:43,550
<i>You can.</i>

880
01:12:43,663 --> 01:12:46,045
<i>Think of something positive.</i>

881
01:12:53,329 --> 01:12:55,331
Into the darkness. It's
just the darkness.

882
01:12:55,537 --> 01:12:58,499
When the darkness comes the light,
then there's another.

883
01:12:58,661 --> 01:13:01,541
There's another day.
There's another day every day.

884
01:13:01,661 --> 01:13:03,331
Every day's a learning day, boy.

885
01:13:03,535 --> 01:13:05,419
<i>Every day's a teaming day.</i>

886
01:13:32,531 --> 01:13:34,082
Where is everyone?

887
01:13:36,613 --> 01:13:38,746
Where you been sleeping, Gen?

888
01:13:40,779 --> 01:13:42,580
Rip's been pulled out.

889
01:13:44,779 --> 01:13:48,156
Rip's mum said you'd been sleeping
up at the monument.

890
01:14:02,026 --> 01:14:03,067
Gen!

891
01:14:46,602 --> 01:14:49,067
Kia or a. Are you Rip's mother?

892
01:14:50,185 --> 01:14:52,816
Hi, my name is Genesis Potini.
I'm his chess coach.

893
01:14:52,934 --> 01:14:56,359
And I implore you to allow him
to stay in the club, please.

894
01:14:56,475 --> 01:14:57,815
Don't make him leave the club.

895
01:14:57,934 --> 01:14:58,976
- Just let him stay...
- I've seen you.

896
01:14:59,100 --> 01:15:01,352
You've been sleeping up on Kaiti Hill.

897
01:15:02,766 --> 01:15:05,065
You just got out of a mental home,
didn't you?

898
01:15:05,182 --> 01:15:08,642
Well, yes,
but please don't do this to him.

899
01:15:08,765 --> 01:15:11,147
You shouldn't be anywhere
near those kids.

900
01:15:24,679 --> 01:15:26,149
Come on. "You shouldn't be anywhere
near those kids.“

901
01:15:26,262 --> 01:15:28,479
“Shouldn't be anywhere
near those kids," eh?

902
01:15:28,595 --> 01:15:29,851
You shouldn't be.

903
01:15:29,970 --> 01:15:31,973
“Shouldn't be anywhere
near those kids."

904
01:15:32,095 --> 01:15:34,726
No, you shouldn't be any...

905
01:15:36,552 --> 01:15:38,637
"You shouldn't be
anywhere near those kids."

906
01:16:06,089 --> 01:16:07,641
Hey, you want to play?

907
01:16:07,756 --> 01:16:10,967
Want to play a game? Come on.
Come on, play a game.

908
01:16:11,089 --> 01:16:14,927
Yeah. Let's have a game. Come on.

909
01:16:15,046 --> 01:16:16,551
You want to...
Don't be frightened of me. Come on.

910
01:16:16,671 --> 01:16:19,254
You can play. You can all play.
Everybody's welcome to play.

911
01:16:19,379 --> 01:16:20,967
Doesn't matter what they tell you.

912
01:16:21,087 --> 01:16:23,255
You're all welcome.
Everybody's welcome here.

913
01:16:23,378 --> 01:16:24,634
Yeah, that's right.

914
01:16:24,753 --> 01:16:28,545
Yeah, doesn't matter if you're a pawn or a
king or a queen or a knight or a bishop.

915
01:16:28,669 --> 01:16:30,377
You're all welcome to
play on this board.

916
01:16:30,460 --> 01:16:32,131
Come on, I can teach
you a thing or two.

917
01:16:32,252 --> 01:16:35,629
Don't be frightened of me.
I'm not gonna bite you.

918
01:16:35,751 --> 01:16:38,429
Look, it's a beautiful day.
It's a beautiful learning day.

919
01:16:38,542 --> 01:16:40,462
We can all learn, can't we?

920
01:16:40,584 --> 01:16:42,254
Every day's a learning day.

921
01:16:42,375 --> 01:16:43,631
Come on. Come down here.

922
01:16:43,750 --> 01:16:46,132
Come on, here.
You want a game?

923
01:16:46,624 --> 01:16:48,923
What's your name? You want to play?

924
01:16:49,832 --> 01:16:51,124
You fellas, too, come on.

925
01:16:51,249 --> 01:16:52,967
Doesn't matter how old you are,
how young you are,

926
01:16:53,082 --> 01:16:55,915
who you are, where you're from.
It doesn't matter what they tell you.

927
01:18:07,070 --> 01:18:09,037
Jesus!

928
01:18:09,153 --> 01:18:11,618
What a Pi!-

929
01:18:13,694 --> 01:18:14,735
Sorry, Gen.

930
01:18:17,610 --> 01:18:23,120
My friend, who is also the most disgusting
person on the Earth, lives here.

931
01:18:23,234 --> 01:18:25,651
He's working in Christchurch
for the next three months,

932
01:18:25,775 --> 01:18:28,276
so you can have it till then.

933
01:18:29,858 --> 01:18:32,026
It's better than a hill, right?

934
01:18:33,232 --> 01:18:35,698
There's a key to a van out the back.

935
01:18:35,815 --> 01:18:36,898
It doesn't have a warrant,

936
01:18:36,982 --> 01:18:40,655
but he said that you can use it
as long as you don't get it ticketed.

937
01:18:40,773 --> 01:18:42,242
My number.

938
01:18:45,855 --> 01:18:48,782
There's milk, eggs, bread.

939
01:19:03,853 --> 01:19:07,479
This is the best thing
that has ever happened to those kids.

940
01:19:19,225 --> 01:19:22,934
I better get you cleaned up
for this fundraiser tomorrow, yeah?

941
01:19:30,223 --> 01:19:31,396
<i>Kia or a, everyone.</i>

942
01:19:31,515 --> 01:19:33,683
My name's Michael Manihera.

943
01:19:34,306 --> 01:19:36,273
This is my family, the Eastern Knights.

944
01:19:36,597 --> 01:19:38,814
We're fundraising here today
for our chess club

945
01:19:38,930 --> 01:19:41,388
so we can go to Auckland
and compete in the national champs.

946
01:19:41,430 --> 01:19:44,440
We've got our bucket down here,
so put money in it if you can.

947
01:19:44,554 --> 01:19:47,268
And if you can't, then
you can just fuck off.

948
01:19:47,387 --> 01:19:48,560
Hey, Michael!

949
01:19:49,429 --> 01:19:50,601
Nah, just kidding.

950
01:19:50,803 --> 01:19:52,273
Is Mana coming?

951
01:19:53,844 --> 01:19:55,598
I don't know.

952
01:20:06,426 --> 01:20:07,599
<i>Kia or a.</i>

953
01:20:07,717 --> 01:20:11,260
This is something I learned
with my friends, Rip and Mana.

954
01:20:12,425 --> 01:20:17,094
<i>Nana chose it (or
Genesis, our chess coach.</i>

955
01:20:17,216 --> 01:20:22,015
They were gonna act it out,
but they couldn't make it.

956
01:20:22,132 --> 01:20:24,762
It's called “The tohunga and the boy."

957
01:20:28,714 --> 01:20:31,475
<i>“Once there was a
tohunga, an old priest,</i>

958
01:20:32,297 --> 01:20:34,714
<i>"who lived up on a cliff.</i>

959
01:20:34,838 --> 01:20:39,258
<i>"In the past, his village
had gone to him for guidance.</i>

960
01:20:39,421 --> 01:20:42,964
<i>"But now they just thought
he was old and crazy.</i>

961
01:20:44,128 --> 01:20:48,181
"One <i>night, he had a dream
of a huge taniwha coming</i>

962
01:20:48,294 --> 01:20:50,593
<i>“and destroying everything</i>

963
01:20:50,710 --> 01:20:53,886
<i>“and only one boy
being able to stand up to it.</i>

964
01:20:56,210 --> 01:20:59,836
<i>"He tried to warn everyone,
but they wouldn't listen.</i>

965
01:20:59,959 --> 01:21:02,720
<i>“Then he saw the boy from his dream.</i>

966
01:21:02,833 --> 01:21:07,384
<i>"He convinced him to be brave enough
to talk to them all.</i>

967
01:21:07,499 --> 01:21:11,587
<i>"That night, the boy nervously stood
in front of the whole village,</i>

968
01:21:11,707 --> 01:21:16,092
<i>"told them that once
the tohunga had been respected,</i>

969
01:21:16,206 --> 01:21:17,960
<i>"and they should listen to him now.</i>

970
01:21:24,622 --> 01:21:25,794
<i>“Feeling bad,</i>

971
01:21:25,913 --> 01:21:29,421
<i>“the people decided
to bring the tohunga some food</i>

972
01:21:29,537 --> 01:21:31,375
<i>“up on his cliff.</i>

973
01:21:33,329 --> 01:21:36,173
<i>“Like the old days, he was happy again.</i>

974
01:21:37,911 --> 01:21:40,376
<i>“Then the earthquake hit.</i>

975
01:21:53,034 --> 01:21:56,790
<i>"As they all watched,
the entire village was flattened,</i>

976
01:21:56,908 --> 01:21:59,290
<i>“ail their houses destroyed.</i>

977
01:21:59,408 --> 01:22:02,667
<i>"But because they was up
on the tohungis cliff,</i>

978
01:22:02,782 --> 01:22:05,199
<i>“not one of them was hurt.</i>

979
01:22:05,323 --> 01:22:09,080
<i>“They hailed the boy and the tohunga
for saving them.</i>

980
01:22:09,198 --> 01:22:13,784
<i>"The boy became their leader,
helping them rebuild the village.</i>

981
01:23:04,689 --> 01:23:07,983
<i>"And when the tohunga
finally left to the spirit world,</i>

982
01:23:08,105 --> 01:23:11,067

for the village."</i>

984
01:23:15,187 --> 01:23:16,527
Thank you.

985
01:23:19,520 --> 01:23:20,562
Fuck that guy, bro.

986
01:23:20,686 --> 01:23:23,862
Tried to get up on my way out the door.

01:23:24,019 --> 01:23:26,484

What? Gen, what?

1009
01:25:17,043 --> 01:25:18,631

what Maui would do if he was me.

1013
01:26:04,493 --> 01:26:06,959
But I couldn't remember.

1014
01:26:08,659 --> 01:26:11,290
Couldn't remember
what you told me any more.

1015
01:26:27,156 --> 01:26:30,166
It's all right. It's all right.

1016
01:26:34,572 --> 01:26:36,491
I talked to Ariki.

1017
01:26:37,446 --> 01:26:39,532
He wants you to come with us now.

1018
01:26:43,737 --> 01:26:45,289
Come on.

No one ever thought I'd do that.

Gen...

1095
01:34:52,659 --> 01:34:54,911

Right. Please wait for the buzzer.

Don't fall for it. Don't fall for it!

1165
01:43:04,330 --> 01:43:05,716
Gen, please!

1166
01:43:06,538 --> 01:43:08,706
Burn the school down, Manihera!

1167
01:43:10,621 --> 01:43:13,038
That's it, sir.
Please, you're gonna have to leave.

1168
01:43:13,162 --> 01:43:14,418
I'm so sorry. I'm gone.

1169
01:43:14,537 --> 01:43:16,753
I'm sorry. I'm gone.

1170
01:43:16,870 --> 01:43:19,547
You're the king, okay?
Give him your energy.

1171
01:43:20,119 --> 01:43:21,671
I'm sorry.

1172
01:43:45,865 --> 01:43:48,081
Develop, coordinate.
Coordinate all your pieces.

1173
01:43:48,198 --> 01:43:50,781
Just look for the combos.
Combinations, combinations.

1174
01:43:50,906 --> 01:43:52,660
That's right, get a flow, active flow.

1175
01:43:52,781 --> 01:43:54,997
Don't leave anyone behind.
You need everybody.

1176
01:43:56,572 --> 01:43:58,242
A net. You <i>catch</i> the sun.
That's how you catch the sun.

1177
01:43:58,363 --> 01:44:00,662
You get a net. And you...

1178
01:44:01,571 --> 01:44:03,988
Keep it positive, positive, positive.

Why don't you crash
at mine tonight, cuz?

1192
01:47:07,208 --> 01:47:09,211
No, I'll be all right.

But I'll come over first thing
in the morning, then, my brother.

Proud of you. Proud.
