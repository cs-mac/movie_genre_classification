<i>And now, get up off your ass!</i>

16
00:01:30,957 --> 00:01:32,549
<i>Get ready to shake your booty.</i>

17
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:35,755
<i>Yo, bitches and bitchettes!</i>

18
00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:37,922
<i>It is the Raider with the Dickhead tour.</i>

19
00:01:37,997 --> 00:01:41,831
<i>And we want you big-butt women</i>
<i>and brothers to get up and dance!</i>

20
00:01:42,969 --> 00:01:46,837
<i>Now live on stage, N. W.H.</i>

21
00:01:48,174 --> 00:01:49,539
<i>Come on!</i>

22
00:01:50,877 --> 00:01:53,209
<i>Don't wear a toupee</i>
<i>'cause that's assimilation</i>

23
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:55,804
<i>Don't say it's okay</i>
<i>that's oral masturbation</i>

24
00:01:55,882 --> 00:01:59,113
<i>Hats offer enclosure</i>
<i>from deadly exposure of sucker imposers</i>

25
00:01:59,185 --> 00:02:01,881
<i>- ready to close your</i>
<i>- Coffin and lower you down, black</i>

26
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:03,946
<i>Bald, buried and beaten into a pre-dug track</i>

27
00:02:04,023 --> 00:02:06,116
<i>That's wack, the way they dis the black</i>

28
00:02:06,192 --> 00:02:08,217
<i>How can we complain</i>
<i>when we don't fight back?</i>

29
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:09,928
<i>It ain't hate 'cause we retaliate</i>

30
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:12,491
<i>with the gat in my hands</i>
<i>and the hat on my pate</i>

31
00:02:12,565 --> 00:02:14,658
<i>See back in the day</i>
<i>out in the fields they kept us</i>

32
00:02:14,734 --> 00:02:16,827
<i>exposed to the rays</i>
<i>without no shields they left us</i>

33
00:02:16,903 --> 00:02:21,033
<i>Without a hat, we was exposed</i>
<i>Without a hat, we was sun-stroked</i>

34
00:02:21,107 --> 00:02:25,407
<i>The African sun was pure and good</i>
<i>never needed a hat, just brotherhood</i>

35
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:27,241
<i>The good old days are</i>
<i>a brother's worst enemy</i>

36
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:29,611
<i>tell me stay bald, I say it ain't in me</i>

37
00:02:29,682 --> 00:02:32,378
<i>Look in my eyes and you'll realize</i>
<i>these ain't lies</i>

38
00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:34,317
<i>- Boy, I wouldn't lead you wrong</i>
<i>- No</i>

39
00:02:34,387 --> 00:02:37,254
<i>Get with the facts as I chart the stats</i>
<i>cold-kick the hats</i>

40
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:38,756
<i>Make the black grow strong!</i>

41
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:40,656
<i>Make the change gotta cover my braids</i>

42
00:02:40,727 --> 00:02:42,558
<i>I deal the pain</i>
<i>to those who keep me in chains</i>

43
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:47,157
<i>They want more than just to see you fall</i>
<i>they wanna keep a brother buried and bald</i>

44
00:02:48,935 --> 00:02:50,197
<i>Wear your hat</i>

45
00:02:55,742 --> 00:02:58,973
<i>That's</i> how it all ends.
But <i>let's</i> start at the beginning.

46
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:01,169
<i>I'm</i> Nina Blackburn.

47
00:03:01,247 --> 00:03:05,616
And what you are about to see
is a documentary on the rap group N.W. H...

48
00:03:05,818 --> 00:03:07,342
or Niggaz With Hats.

49
00:03:07,554 --> 00:03:11,217
I began this project as a thesis
for my doctorate in sociology.

50
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:14,458
My belief was that
not only does rap function...

51
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:17,360
as the political voice
of <i>today's</i> urban youth...

52
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:20,558
but it also serves as a tracer
of styles and values.

53
00:03:21,067 --> 00:03:23,433
I was attracted to N.W.H. Because of...

54
00:03:23,503 --> 00:03:26,995
the strong political poses
adopted on such albums as the...

55
00:03:27,273 --> 00:03:30,731
controversial and never released
<i>Kill Whitey</i> album.

56
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:34,009
This group also seems
to epitomize the disdain...

57
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,548
towards women found
in much of rap culture...

58
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:39,312
with songs such as
<i>My Peanuts</i> and <i>Booty Juice...</i>

59
00:03:39,652 --> 00:03:41,950
which they claim is a political theme.

60
00:03:42,121 --> 00:03:45,147
So sit back and enjoy.
The brothers have a lot to say.

61
00:03:46,926 --> 00:03:50,225
Now, I hear you guys are
from a really rough neighborhood.

62
00:03:50,463 --> 00:03:51,623
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

63
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:55,299
So, where? Compton? The sewer? Oakland?

64
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:56,892
- All that <i>shit's</i> for punks.
- Brooklyn?

65
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:59,939
No, we <i>don't</i> necessarily like to say
where we're from.

66
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,931
I thought all rappers like to say
where they're from.

67
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:05,443
Bragging about their neighborhood
as the toughest.

68
00:04:05,511 --> 00:04:06,671
Yeah, we could.

69
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:09,340
<i>That's</i> like a motherfucker
saying he got a big dick...

70
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:10,609
and can fuck for hours.

71
00:04:10,683 --> 00:04:13,743
Exactly. So what we're saying is,
we <i>don't</i> front.

72
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,913
We perform in this motherfucker.

73
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:19,314
They say <i>it's</i> the quiet ones
that you have to watch out for.

74
00:04:19,392 --> 00:04:23,055
And if you've noticed, I <i>ain't</i>
said shit for a couple minutes now.

75
00:04:23,663 --> 00:04:27,565
<i>That's</i> true. I also noticed
that you <i>don't</i> smile too much.

76
00:04:27,634 --> 00:04:28,623
Damn skippy.

77
00:04:28,701 --> 00:04:31,192
If you be smiling,
motherfuckers think you're a punk.

78
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:32,465
And I <i>ain't</i> no punk.

79
00:04:32,538 --> 00:04:35,234
Tasty once shot a motherfucker
for taking his picture...

80
00:04:35,308 --> 00:04:37,503
while he was thinking about smiling.

81
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:41,640
- How about when you're making love?
- Nah!

82
00:04:42,048 --> 00:04:44,676
If you smile, the woman thinks she got you.

83
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:48,443
The next thing you know,
she asking you for money and shit.

84
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:52,155
Exactly. The best thing, if you think
you're the kind of motherfucker...

85
00:04:52,225 --> 00:04:54,921
<i>that's</i> predisposed to be smiling and shit...

86
00:04:54,994 --> 00:04:57,394
you best to kick that shit doggie-style.

87
00:04:57,897 --> 00:05:00,627
Then you can go in from behind, right?

88
00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:03,392
Then you <i>don't</i> have to worry
about her seeing you.

89
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:07,565
- You can make all kind of faces.
- Make sure you <i>ain't</i> got no mirrors around.

90
00:05:08,908 --> 00:05:12,071
Ice, at that time you had a song out
called <i>My Peanuts?</i>

91
00:05:12,412 --> 00:05:15,506
<i>That's</i> one of the first things
that I dropped, <i>My Peanuts.</i>

92
00:05:15,581 --> 00:05:19,449
I had to get that pressed myself,
then I sold it out the trunk of my car.

93
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:22,579
- Right here on this very street.
- I remember. That was dope.

94
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:26,989
Tone was slinging bean pies, because
he was hooked up in that Muslim shit.

95
00:05:27,727 --> 00:05:32,187
- And Tasty was slinging...
- I was a pharmaceutical distributor.

96
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:37,401
We <i>shouldn't</i> be talking about that,
you know what <i>I'm</i> saying?

97
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:39,028
Maybe you can edit that out.

98
00:05:43,743 --> 00:05:45,040
<i>My peanuts!</i>

99
00:05:48,114 --> 00:05:51,413
<i>Well, they're low cholesterol</i>
<i>and high protein</i>

100
00:05:51,484 --> 00:05:53,952
<i>Hotter than a Mexican jumping bean</i>

101
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,511
<i>Have them dry-roasted or vacuum-packed</i>

102
00:05:56,589 --> 00:05:59,057
<i>My peanuts come alive</i>
<i>when you open that sack</i>

103
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:01,889
<i>Smoother than Jif</i>
<i>and fresher than Planters</i>

104
00:06:01,961 --> 00:06:04,191
<i>My peanuts exceed all standards</i>

105
00:06:04,263 --> 00:06:06,754
<i>They're def enough</i>
<i>to knock you to your knees</i>

106
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:10,234
<i>Even Planters ain't got no nuts like these</i>
<i>My peanuts!</i>

107
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,941
They dissed us and shit,
<i>what's</i> up with that?

108
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:20,740
Now <i>I'm</i> going to have to bust a cap
in <i>somebody's</i> ass.

109
00:06:20,813 --> 00:06:23,873
- Is there a problem?
- Hell yeah, <i>there's</i> a problem.

110
00:06:23,983 --> 00:06:26,679
You got Jam Boys, Yo Highness,
M.C. Slammer...

111
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:30,086
Touch & Groove, and Special Guest.
<i>Everybody's</i> up there but us, N.W.H.

112
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:32,021
- <i>What's</i> up with that?
- We are "Special <i>Guest."</i>

113
00:06:32,091 --> 00:06:34,787
The <i>"L"</i> is a problem.
I am going to take care of that.

114
00:06:34,861 --> 00:06:37,955
We N.W.H.,
we <i>ain't</i> no motherfucking special guest.

115
00:06:38,097 --> 00:06:40,691
Sorry. Go back to your hotel,
come back for sound check.

116
00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:42,257
<i>It's</i> taken care of.

117
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:49,268
Step to the right.

118
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:52,969
Wait a minute, where are you guys going?

119
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,973
Yo, man, we're going backstage,
<i>what's</i> the problem?

120
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:58,573
Problem is, I <i>don't</i> know who you guys are.

121
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:01,843
- Man, we N.W.H.
- In the house.

122
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:04,287
N.W. H? In the house?

123
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:07,852
You <i>ain't</i> on the list.
You got to step aside, baby.

124
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:10,191
Wait. What you mean we <i>ain't</i> on the list?

125
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:13,460
Word, man. Look, Niggaz With Hats.
All right?

126
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,566
Well, I <i>ain't</i> seen no N.W.H.,
Niggaz With Hemorrhoids...

127
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:20,105
or anything else like that on the marquis.

128
00:07:20,239 --> 00:07:23,936
Look, man, we the "also Special <i>Guest"</i>
on the end of the marquis.

129
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:28,608
- Also Special motherfucking Guest.
- "Also Special <i>Guest."</i> Really important?

130
00:07:28,881 --> 00:07:30,644
- Check the list.
- It <i>ain't</i> on here.

131
00:07:30,716 --> 00:07:33,583
I want N.W.H. On the marquis,
we're part of the headlining bill.

132
00:07:33,653 --> 00:07:36,747
When you put Yo Highness on the bill,
you bumped everything else off.

133
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,751
You <i>don't</i> even know your rap history.

134
00:07:39,826 --> 00:07:41,987
Who is Spooney G?
The Sequence Brothers?

135
00:07:42,061 --> 00:07:44,689
A bonus question.
How many people in The Funky Four?

136
00:07:44,764 --> 00:07:46,254
You <i>can't</i> tell <i>me...</i>

137
00:07:46,332 --> 00:07:48,129
You're not on the list.

138
00:07:49,101 --> 00:07:51,035
Look <i>who's</i> rolling behind you, man.

139
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:55,266
Yeah, right! <i>That's</i> a old one.
<i>I'm</i> supposed to turn around and look...

140
00:07:55,341 --> 00:07:58,902
while you guys walk in.
You think <i>I'm</i> stupid? It <i>ain't</i> like that.

141
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:02,708
Take yourselves on out. We got
a real show to do with real performers.

142
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:05,045
Jam Boys! Fellas.

143
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:08,643
All right. Looking good.

144
00:08:08,721 --> 00:08:10,712
<i>Let's</i> have a good show tonight.

145
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:11,779
Yo!

146
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:13,814
Boot!

147
00:08:16,462 --> 00:08:20,159
- Tell that motherfucker who we are.
- Yo, man, you know these guys?

148
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:21,791
You <i>don't</i> know who they are?

149
00:08:22,468 --> 00:08:25,699
They're supposed to clean up
the stage after we rip it up.

150
00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:32,070
- I really enjoy your work.
- Great jacket.

151
00:08:32,144 --> 00:08:34,339
Rich, emotional tapestry. Keep it up.

152
00:08:34,413 --> 00:08:37,075
We got a show to do. I <i>can't</i> help you.

153
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:43,417
He got a gun. Shit, he got a gun.

154
00:08:43,489 --> 00:08:45,889
Motherfuckers be hollering. I'll see you.

155
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:48,523
Okay, I'll change the marquis.

156
00:08:56,702 --> 00:09:00,968
Welcome to the Landmark Theater.
<i>I'm</i> John Craw, head of security here.

157
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:05,143
This is a wonderful old venue,
we used to have some wonderful acts here.

158
00:09:05,344 --> 00:09:09,212
Laverne and Shirley came through here,
the Osmond brothers, Mack Davis.

159
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:12,010
Now we have rappers.
So I've had to add a few extra...

160
00:09:12,084 --> 00:09:14,382
layers to the security system,
<i>it's</i> no problem.

161
00:09:14,453 --> 00:09:17,820
We start here with the brothers
from the Nation of Islam.

162
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:21,849
They keep things under control.
These guys are very under-control people.

163
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:26,422
Nothing rattles them. They keep things
on a calm, even-keel kind of level.

164
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:27,796
And everything.

165
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:31,959
And they'll drop your ass
like a bad bean pie if you fuck up, too.

166
00:09:32,038 --> 00:09:34,029
Friesch, we need a bigger room.

167
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:38,343
Word, man. And another thing:
We <i>don't</i> have our hats, man.

168
00:09:38,945 --> 00:09:42,437
Hats? What do you mean?
Did you check the truck?

169
00:09:42,515 --> 00:09:46,383
- They <i>ain't</i> on the truck or here.
- We <i>ain't</i> going on stage without our gear.

170
00:09:46,452 --> 00:09:48,283
We got to have our performance gear.

171
00:09:48,354 --> 00:09:51,289
You know what?
<i>I'm</i> glad we <i>don't</i> have hats.

172
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:54,023
You know what? <i>It's</i> always the same thing.

173
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:55,890
We've got to mix things up more.

174
00:09:55,962 --> 00:09:57,827
<i>Predictability...</i> Can I go on record here?

175
00:09:57,897 --> 00:10:00,991
Predictability is
the stepson of ingenuity. Okay?

176
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,489
- Yes?
- Hold up, man.

177
00:10:02,568 --> 00:10:05,696
We are N.W.H. <i>That's</i> Niggaz With Hats.

178
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:09,439
If we <i>don't</i> have hats,
then we Niggaz Without Hats.

179
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:11,635
<i>That's</i> a whole different group of niggas.

180
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:14,145
I've got to part company
with you for a second, Ice...

181
00:10:14,213 --> 00:10:17,182
because we are still N.W.H., okay?

182
00:10:17,249 --> 00:10:20,582
We're just growing. I got an idea.
We're growing as artists.

183
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,278
You know? We're done with that.

184
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:26,758
We did the regular hat thing.
Now we're stretching, we're moving on.

185
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:29,192
And this is what we're going to try tonight.

186
00:10:29,261 --> 00:10:31,923
There it is. Look at this, you got a hat here.

187
00:10:32,231 --> 00:10:34,791
You put some riot headlines on the sides...

188
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:38,631
you make your statement,
<i>it's</i> right there in black and white.

189
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:41,671
We've got a trend thing happening there,
you see that?

190
00:10:41,741 --> 00:10:43,038
<i>That's</i> wack.

191
00:10:43,576 --> 00:10:47,945
Man, this <i>ain't Romper Room,</i> and I <i>ain't</i>
going out with page seven on my head.

192
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:52,107
This <i>ain't</i> right. We need to have our hats.
Our performance hats.

193
00:10:53,219 --> 00:10:54,379
- Word.
- Yeah?

194
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,119
And a bigger room.

195
00:10:56,555 --> 00:11:00,082
- Okay, is that setup right around the corner?
- Man, find the damn hats.

196
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,251
All right.

197
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:05,763
Guys, <i>what's</i> the deal with the hats?

198
00:11:06,132 --> 00:11:10,034
<i>That's</i> what N.W.H. Is all about,
we got a whole hat philosophy.

199
00:11:10,236 --> 00:11:11,794
You know what <i>I'm</i> saying?

200
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:15,773
I mean, back in the days
when there was slaves and stuff...

201
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:18,571
they would work in the hot sun all day.

202
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:21,579
With the sun beating down on them.
Hatless.

203
00:11:21,647 --> 00:11:23,376
I mean, not even a babushka.

204
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:26,509
Word. Heads totally exposed to the sun.

205
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:30,314
You know? So, by the time
they got back to the plantation...

206
00:11:30,489 --> 00:11:34,892
from being in all the heat, they was
too tired to rebel against their masters.

207
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:37,325
So what we saying with Niggaz With Hats is:

208
00:11:37,396 --> 00:11:40,365
<i>"Yo, we got some hats now, motherfuckers."</i>

209
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,436
- Yo, <i>what's</i> up, G?
- N.W.H. Is in the house!

210
00:11:45,671 --> 00:11:47,639
<i>What's</i> up? N.W.H. In the house.

211
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,436
<i>What's</i> up? <i>I'm</i> Vanilla Sherbet and shit.

212
00:11:50,242 --> 00:11:53,643
<i>I'm</i> down with you motherfuckers.
I been listening to you for a long time.

213
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:55,578
I got all your old tracks.

214
00:11:56,115 --> 00:11:57,742
I got <i>Booty Juice...</i>

215
00:11:58,117 --> 00:12:02,884
<i>P.U.S.S. Y.</i> I got all that old shit.
I got your old track, Ice man.

216
00:12:02,955 --> 00:12:03,944
That shit:

217
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:06,150
<i>My penis, big and large</i>

218
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:09,251
- Peanuts. My peanuts.
- That shit was on.

219
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:10,659
That shit was dope, G.

220
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,857
<i>I'm</i> down with you motherfuckers,
I can relate.

221
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:16,698
Because I grew up in the 'hood.
I was raised by a black family.

222
00:12:16,836 --> 00:12:19,828
Because my parents abandoned me.
So I can relate to you.

223
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:21,497
<i>I'm</i> almost like a brother.

224
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:24,099
We gotta hook up after the show.

225
00:12:24,176 --> 00:12:26,974
Go pick up some bitches.
Smoke a big, fat blunt.

226
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:30,015
<i>We'd</i> be chilling.
Because y'all my niggas, dude.

227
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:32,346
- You are my niggas.
- Niggas?

228
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:34,443
- Yeah, we chilling.
- We need to talk.

229
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:38,456
N.W.H. In the house.
Vanilla Sherbet. <i>What's</i> up, G!

230
00:12:38,557 --> 00:12:41,458
We <i>chillin',</i> we about to kick it, yo.

231
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:46,726
You're N.W. H?

232
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:49,296
- Yeah. <i>What's</i> up?
- About your manager.

233
00:12:49,368 --> 00:12:52,462
Man, we had nothing to do
with what happened tonight.

234
00:12:52,538 --> 00:12:54,062
<i>That's</i> not the issue.

235
00:12:54,173 --> 00:12:56,971
Did he pass on
what I told him before you came out?

236
00:12:58,244 --> 00:13:00,144
- What?
- Basically...

237
00:13:00,479 --> 00:13:03,642
if you guys perform the song
<i>Grab Your Shit</i> tonight...

238
00:13:05,384 --> 00:13:07,750
we'll have to arrest you for obscenity.

239
00:13:07,887 --> 00:13:10,355
- What you talking about, man?
- Listen...

240
00:13:11,056 --> 00:13:12,182
the lyrics:

241
00:13:13,058 --> 00:13:15,959
<i>"Grab your shit, cover up...

242
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:20,289
- "N.W.H. Say grab your <i>dick."</i>
- <i>That's</i> live, <i>ain't</i> it?

243
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:25,195
Whoever says those words,
I hear them and they say them...

244
00:13:26,205 --> 00:13:27,797
they're going to jail.

245
00:13:28,707 --> 00:13:30,197
Break a leg, fellas.

246
00:13:31,443 --> 00:13:34,071
- Fuck y'all.
- Punk.

247
00:13:35,114 --> 00:13:37,344
We should've bust a cap in their ass.

248
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:41,219
Normally I <i>wouldn't</i> be
for changing something.

249
00:13:41,754 --> 00:13:45,349
But seeing as how our manager
got tapped on tonight, I think...

250
00:13:45,624 --> 00:13:48,252
maybe we ought to play it safe for the night.

251
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:52,559
<i>I'm</i> down with artistic integrity and all that,
but <i>lockup's</i> a bitch.

252
00:13:53,232 --> 00:13:56,360
This is what we gonna do.
We gonna <i>change...</i>

253
00:13:57,069 --> 00:14:01,233
We'll change the "shit" and "dick"
to "Cover up and grab your <i>stuff."</i>

254
00:14:01,574 --> 00:14:03,201
- All right?
- Word.

255
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:05,510
- But just for tonight.
- Just for tonight.

256
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:08,979
- Tomorrow we back to "shit" and "dick."
- Hey, tomorrow we in St. Louis...

257
00:14:09,048 --> 00:14:12,415
- so you know what <i>that's</i> all about.
- They like the shits and dick.

258
00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:16,655
<i>And now N. W.H.</i>

259
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:29,528
<i>People ask why I walk this way</i>
<i>Protection first is all I say</i>

260
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:32,127
<i>I got it, they want it</i>
<i>believe it, they'll steal it</i>

261
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:34,434
<i>Some of them punks just want to feel it</i>

262
00:14:34,506 --> 00:14:38,567
<i>When they see me grip with both hands</i>
<i>It's a black thing they don't understand</i>

263
00:14:38,644 --> 00:14:43,206
<i>It's true they want to take it all</i>
<i>So before they rip you ball for ball</i>

264
00:14:43,315 --> 00:14:45,579
<i>Cup your hand, cover up</i>

265
00:14:45,651 --> 00:14:48,552
<i>N. W.H. Say grab your stuff</i>

266
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:52,282
<i>Grab it! You gotta grab it! Grab it!</i>

267
00:14:56,262 --> 00:14:57,593
<i>Grab your stuff</i>

268
00:15:05,604 --> 00:15:10,064
<i>Four hundred years and it ain't enough</i>
<i>Suckers still trying to take our stuff</i>

269
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:14,703
<i>Stealing it, swiping it, ripping it, biting it</i>
<i>they can't grow it, so punks try to heist it</i>

270
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:18,443
<i>We ain't down with that, no</i>
<i>Got to look out for the black</i>

271
00:15:18,517 --> 00:15:21,452
<i>When they start going for the family jewels</i>

272
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,647
<i>Protect that gear by whatever tools</i>

273
00:15:23,722 --> 00:15:25,781
<i>Cup your hand, cover up</i>

274
00:15:26,058 --> 00:15:28,891
<i>N. W.H. Say grab your stuff!</i>

275
00:15:28,961 --> 00:15:30,622
<i>Grab it! You gotta grab it! Grab it!</i>

276
00:15:40,472 --> 00:15:42,599
<i>Shit, my dick!</i>

277
00:15:43,242 --> 00:15:44,266
<i>My dick!</i>

278
00:15:44,576 --> 00:15:45,873
<i>God, my dick!</i>

279
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,505
Where you're going, boy,
you should grab your ass!

280
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:49,706
My dick!

281
00:15:51,984 --> 00:15:53,144
Oh, my dick!

282
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:56,852
<i>This was the first</i>
<i>of N. W.H. 's several brushes...</i>

283
00:15:56,922 --> 00:15:58,822
<i>with the law regarding censorship.</i>

284
00:15:58,891 --> 00:16:01,291
<i>I caught up with the group</i>
<i>again on the road.</i>

285
00:16:02,227 --> 00:16:05,754
Now, your new album is
<i>N. W.H. Fear of a Black Hat.</i>

286
00:16:06,231 --> 00:16:10,395
Right. But that shit was supposed to be
<i>N. W.H. Fear of a Black Hat...</i>

287
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:12,994
then subtitled,
<i>"Don't</i> Shoot Until You See the <i>Whites."</i>

288
00:16:13,072 --> 00:16:14,869
- Of their eyes?
- Whose eyes?

289
00:16:15,207 --> 00:16:17,641
<i>Don't</i> shoot until you see
the whites of their eyes.

290
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:20,770
No, just <i>don't</i> shoot until
you see the whites, period.

291
00:16:20,846 --> 00:16:23,144
<i>That's</i> it. End of story.
You know what <i>I'm</i> saying?

292
00:16:23,215 --> 00:16:25,706
But the record company,
they dogged us out.

293
00:16:25,884 --> 00:16:29,581
- They <i>didn't</i> let us put it on there.
- We should've bust a cap in their ass.

294
00:16:29,722 --> 00:16:32,919
See, they always trying to censor our shit.

295
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:35,418
For instance, with the song <i>Kill Whitey.</i>

296
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:38,827
No, that shit was
a whole big misunderstanding, there.

297
00:16:38,897 --> 00:16:40,990
They took the whole thing out of context.

298
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:44,695
They was trying to say that
we was advocating killing white people.

299
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:47,034
Do I look like the kind of person
who could kill...

300
00:16:47,106 --> 00:16:49,370
a whole bunch of white motherfuckers?

301
00:16:49,608 --> 00:16:53,044
I mean, you know, given a reason.
But not on a humbug.

302
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:56,042
Well, in the song lyrics, and <i>I'm</i> quoting:

303
00:16:56,281 --> 00:16:59,614
<i>"He'll</i> rip you off, he'll take your money,
make you work for free.

304
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:03,212
<i>"Though you might scoff,
it <i>isn't</i> funny, <i>he's</i> the devil, see.

305
00:17:03,322 --> 00:17:04,584
<i>"Kill Whitey."</i>

306
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,749
How can you listen to that and think...

307
00:17:06,825 --> 00:17:09,385
we talking about killing all white people?

308
00:17:09,461 --> 00:17:12,453
We was talking about one specific Whitey.

309
00:17:13,065 --> 00:17:17,126
Whitey Dilucca. Our ex-manager.
He ripped us off for $70,000.

310
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:20,134
Right, and Whitey Dilucca
<i>wasn't</i> even white. He <i>was...</i>

311
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:25,165
He was Italian. He was one of them
olive-complected motherfuckers.

312
00:17:25,277 --> 00:17:27,939
If I remember correctly,
he ended up murdered.

313
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,745
- We <i>wasn't</i> in town when that happened.
- No, man, we was there...

314
00:17:31,817 --> 00:17:33,682
We was in Cleveland.

315
00:17:33,752 --> 00:17:36,448
- No, we went over to...
- No, money, we was in Toronto.

316
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:38,990
We were trying to set that shit straight.

317
00:17:39,324 --> 00:17:42,623
- Let me talk to you, man.
- Cut this shit now.

318
00:17:42,694 --> 00:17:44,821
<i>Up from the bottom of the heap we creep</i>

319
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:47,297
<i>Sneak peek</i>
<i>breakin' through the concrete</i>

320
00:17:47,466 --> 00:17:51,664
<i>Tired of livin' in an occupied state</i>
<i>other motherfuckers decidin' our fate</i>

321
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:54,467
<i>- Now see me</i>
<i>- Jack you in the valley</i>

322
00:17:57,676 --> 00:18:00,304
<i>Don't</i> you think this song is a little extreme?

323
00:18:00,946 --> 00:18:03,608
No, man, <i>that's</i> my experience from jail.

324
00:18:03,682 --> 00:18:06,150
<i>That's</i> the black <i>man's</i> experience, man.

325
00:18:06,218 --> 00:18:09,244
<i>It's</i> my experience that
this type of song causes problems.

326
00:18:09,321 --> 00:18:11,118
I mean, the lyrics here:

327
00:18:11,457 --> 00:18:14,688
<i>"See me jack you in the valley,
see me ice you in the <i>alley."</i>

328
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,694
I mean, <i>that's</i> a bit too much.

329
00:18:16,895 --> 00:18:20,661
And what about this concept of a video...

330
00:18:20,732 --> 00:18:22,825
that has you guys killing police officers?

331
00:18:22,901 --> 00:18:25,461
<i>Can't</i> you guys just
dance around like Hammer?

332
00:18:25,904 --> 00:18:27,064
Like Hammer?

333
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:30,435
And one, and two, and three.

334
00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:32,908
And spin that shit around.

335
00:18:34,213 --> 00:18:38,513
Yeah, <i>that's</i> the move <i>I'm</i> looking for.
Spin like that, exactly.

336
00:18:39,384 --> 00:18:41,181
A little more hip movement.

337
00:18:42,154 --> 00:18:43,553
Yeah, spin it around.

338
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:45,650
<i>That's</i> good.

339
00:18:45,757 --> 00:18:48,817
Keep it going,
<i>don't</i> try and keep up with me.

340
00:18:50,195 --> 00:18:53,460
Tasty? What the fuck you doing?
We are making a video here.

341
00:18:53,565 --> 00:18:55,226
- <i>Can't</i> you teach him the steps?
- Wait.

342
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:58,098
You do not be stopping
the music in my studio.

343
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:01,003
- <i>I'm</i> the director of this video.
- I <i>don't</i> care.

344
00:19:01,073 --> 00:19:03,735
Have you ever seen
<i>Charles in Charge,</i> the TV show?

345
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:06,710
Okay, my name is Darryl.
Darryl is in charge here, okay?

346
00:19:06,778 --> 00:19:09,178
So you move your
little skinny hips on over there.

347
00:19:09,248 --> 00:19:12,046
And I take care of everything
from here, all right?

348
00:19:12,885 --> 00:19:14,409
I'll take care of it.

349
00:19:14,753 --> 00:19:16,618
Just show the motherfucker the steps.

350
00:19:16,688 --> 00:19:18,519
Cool. Just go on over there.

351
00:19:18,857 --> 00:19:19,846
Go.

352
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:22,555
I <i>ain't</i> afraid of you. Go.

353
00:19:23,228 --> 00:19:24,354
Think he tough?

354
00:19:24,429 --> 00:19:27,557
Okay, I see you seem to be
having some problems.

355
00:19:27,633 --> 00:19:29,828
Yeah, <i>I'm</i> having problems.
I <i>ain't</i> no damn dancer.

356
00:19:29,902 --> 00:19:31,802
What is this <i>Solid Gold</i> shit!

357
00:19:32,871 --> 00:19:34,202
No, you didn't.

358
00:19:34,273 --> 00:19:38,073
Do not be calling my choreography
no <i>Solid Gold</i> shit. Okay?

359
00:19:38,143 --> 00:19:40,771
This is progressive, baby.
<i>Don't</i> even take me there.

360
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:42,837
You need some personal help.

361
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:46,476
Everybody, take five.
Take a little rest. Get some Coke.

362
00:19:46,552 --> 00:19:48,486
Me and you, we're going to work together.

363
00:19:48,554 --> 00:19:50,681
We are going to work together on this.

364
00:19:50,756 --> 00:19:54,453
Get into position. You need to relax.
You all uptight. Rapper and all that.

365
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:57,188
No, just keep that loose.
Keep that open like that.

366
00:19:57,262 --> 00:20:00,288
Now, relax the shoulders
and start by shimmying on the top...

367
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:03,095
and bend it over like that.
Bring it back up like that.

368
00:20:03,168 --> 00:20:06,137
<i>Don't</i> turn around. Face that way.
Just work it like that.

369
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:07,968
Man, what you doing!

370
00:20:08,273 --> 00:20:10,400
I <i>ain't</i> with that! <i>Don't</i> touch me!

371
00:20:11,076 --> 00:20:13,374
I'll take that whip and whip your ass.

372
00:20:13,512 --> 00:20:17,608
You will? Then start to work, daddy,
I kind of like that. Here is the handle.

373
00:20:18,584 --> 00:20:21,485
Yo, Ice, <i>I'm</i> outtie, man.
I <i>can't</i> deal with this, man.

374
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:25,483
Hang on one second. Guys, John Ligget.
I'll just wrap up this call.

375
00:20:26,358 --> 00:20:28,121
Yo, <i>what's</i> up with you homies?

376
00:20:29,528 --> 00:20:31,996
I've got something
I need to talk to you about.

377
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:36,091
And I thought we could just kick it to
the curb for a couple minutes, okay?

378
00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:40,264
What I want to talk to you about is
the album cover to <i>Guerrillas in the Midst.</i>

379
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:41,903
Now <i>that's</i> fly.

380
00:20:41,974 --> 00:20:45,603
<i>That's</i> pretty live with all them cops
with their butts up in the air like that.

381
00:20:45,677 --> 00:20:48,043
And us standing over them. Right, Friesch?

382
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:51,511
Hang on a second.
What exactly? How many cops on the pile?

383
00:20:51,683 --> 00:20:53,844
- Fifteen.
- Fifteen. And you want?

384
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:55,308
None.

385
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:58,283
None? Why <i>don't</i> we split the difference?
Seven.

386
00:20:58,857 --> 00:21:01,087
No, <i>that's</i> not going to solve the problem.

387
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:04,026
What we have to be concerned with
is the moral watchdogs.

388
00:21:04,229 --> 00:21:07,221
People always got a problem
with what we sing anyhow.

389
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:11,126
Look, normally I would
support you guys one hundred percent.

390
00:21:11,203 --> 00:21:14,400
But I <i>can't</i> this time.
To put this album out the way it is...

391
00:21:14,473 --> 00:21:16,270
it just <i>wouldn't</i> be def!

392
00:21:16,975 --> 00:21:18,465
<i>"It wouldn't</i> be <i>def"?</i>

393
00:21:18,577 --> 00:21:22,411
Right! It is not the def, chill,
fresh thing to do.

394
00:21:22,514 --> 00:21:27,008
I mean, it stirs things up too much.
It screams violence.

395
00:21:27,352 --> 00:21:30,651
<i>That's</i> all related to that shit
that came way back then.

396
00:21:31,223 --> 00:21:35,751
My point is, we <i>can't</i> let the white man
tell us how to sell to our market.

397
00:21:35,827 --> 00:21:37,419
You know what I am saying?

398
00:21:37,562 --> 00:21:40,531
- Right, Friesch?
- The white man, no good!

399
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:44,467
Look, I am a white man,
<i>that's</i> not the issue here.

400
00:21:44,536 --> 00:21:47,903
But what <i>I'm</i> trying to tell you guys is
either you do it our way...

401
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:49,702
or we <i>don't</i> do it at all.

402
00:21:50,342 --> 00:21:52,207
Are we cool on this, brothers?

403
00:21:53,445 --> 00:21:56,073
No, I <i>don't</i> feel too cool at all, man.

404
00:21:56,548 --> 00:21:58,277
<i>I'm</i> feeling kind of cocky.

405
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:00,711
We're going to have to talk to you, brother.

406
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:05,481
I think we got a little situation here.
Be right back.

407
00:22:10,062 --> 00:22:12,997
That was bad,
kicking the record company <i>guy's</i> ass.

408
00:22:13,265 --> 00:22:15,995
That was counter-productive.
I got to be honest.

409
00:22:17,069 --> 00:22:19,128
- But he was a dick, man.
- I know.

410
00:22:19,204 --> 00:22:22,071
A punk motherfucker if I ever saw one.
<i>You'd</i> have kicked his ass.

411
00:22:22,274 --> 00:22:24,242
That could be. <i>Here's what's</i> going on.

412
00:22:24,309 --> 00:22:28,769
I am going to move you guys to
another label, called Innergroove Records.

413
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:30,178
Happening! They <i>are...</i>

414
00:22:30,248 --> 00:22:33,149
<i>Soon after, N. W.H. Signed</i>
<i>with Innergroove Records.</i>

415
00:22:33,218 --> 00:22:36,085
<i>And they released</i> Guerrillas in the Midst.
<i>Uncut.</i>

416
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:47,658
<i>Guerrillas in the midst of a race riot</i>

417
00:22:47,733 --> 00:22:50,395
<i>Say it ain't black or white</i>
<i>but I ain't dumb and don't buy it</i>

418
00:22:50,502 --> 00:22:54,370
<i>Talkin' about a time to heal</i>
<i>But step to it, time for you to get real</i>

419
00:22:54,439 --> 00:22:57,408
<i>We can't do it</i>
<i>We were lookin' for healin' in the court, see</i>

420
00:22:57,476 --> 00:22:59,444
<i>Out in the valley of the Simi</i>

421
00:22:59,511 --> 00:23:02,071
<i>But a black man gets no justice</i>

422
00:23:02,147 --> 00:23:04,547
<i>'Cause the kangaroo court don't trust us</i>

423
00:23:04,616 --> 00:23:06,846
<i>Wasn't the first and won't be the last</i>

424
00:23:06,918 --> 00:23:09,079
<i>Brothers got to move to get that ass</i>

425
00:23:09,154 --> 00:23:11,452
<i>Plead your case to the C-O-U-R-T</i>

426
00:23:11,523 --> 00:23:13,787
<i>But they never see Y-O-U and me</i>

427
00:23:13,959 --> 00:23:17,918
<i>Verdict by a punk-assed jury</i>
<i>opened up a black man's fury</i>

428
00:23:18,997 --> 00:23:20,055
See that?

429
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:24,634
<i>Guerrillas in the Midst.</i>
Man, that is going to be crazy large!

430
00:23:25,137 --> 00:23:29,301
And the album, <i>Fear of a Black Hat,</i>
<i>that's</i> going to be bigger than <i>Wild Thing.</i>

431
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:31,974
Man, you brothers are going to be large...

432
00:23:32,344 --> 00:23:34,744
for the simple fact that you're with me.

433
00:23:34,813 --> 00:23:38,442
And I got the winning team, and I am large.
I am larger than large.

434
00:23:38,517 --> 00:23:41,247
In fact, I am so big they call me Dinosaur.

435
00:23:43,488 --> 00:23:46,924
But you got to be careful.
Y'all talking about some heavy shit.

436
00:23:46,992 --> 00:23:51,486
That <i>ain't</i> your average garden-variety,
run-of-the-mill gangster bullshit.

437
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:54,528
Y'all hardcore. But you got an edge.

438
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:58,497
I mean, just look at you three brothers.
Just look at you. Together.

439
00:23:59,371 --> 00:24:00,360
You.

440
00:24:00,472 --> 00:24:03,168
You little black,
stove-pipe-colored nigga, Tasty.

441
00:24:03,241 --> 00:24:06,039
You are the same complexion
as Marcus Garvey...

442
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:10,275
who brought self-love to the black
consciousness movement in the 1930s.

443
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:12,417
And when we speak about complexion...

444
00:24:12,484 --> 00:24:16,181
we move into the political perspective
of where y'all coming from.

445
00:24:16,254 --> 00:24:17,846
You, Ice.

446
00:24:18,356 --> 00:24:20,517
You a high-yellow,
piss-colored motherfucker.

447
00:24:20,592 --> 00:24:22,753
Same complexion as Bob Marley.

448
00:24:23,161 --> 00:24:25,322
You even got that
dreadlock thing going for you.

449
00:24:25,397 --> 00:24:28,457
You could even move into the whole
Rasta thing, if you wanted to.

450
00:24:28,533 --> 00:24:30,023
But <i>that's</i> another story.

451
00:24:30,101 --> 00:24:31,090
And you.

452
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:35,570
You good, red-boned, morani-colored...

453
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,006
genie-in-a-bottle-looking motherfucker.

454
00:24:38,343 --> 00:24:41,312
You're the same complexion as Malcolm X.

455
00:24:41,746 --> 00:24:43,771
<i>That's</i> right. Take off your hat.

456
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:49,010
Red hair! Just like Malcolm.

457
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:52,518
Boy, <i>I'm</i> telling you,
you brothers are going to be large!

458
00:24:53,191 --> 00:24:55,386
Like I said, you got to be careful.

459
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:58,395
Because you're telling the truth
and the white man...

460
00:24:58,463 --> 00:25:00,658
<i>don't</i> want you all saying
what you're saying.

461
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:04,726
Because when you take that bus...

462
00:25:05,937 --> 00:25:07,199
you get there.

463
00:25:09,608 --> 00:25:10,870
<i>That's</i> heavy.

464
00:25:11,309 --> 00:25:12,571
Wait a second.

465
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:14,770
You understand this motherfucker?

466
00:25:15,146 --> 00:25:16,306
Oh, yeah.

467
00:25:18,383 --> 00:25:21,910
<i>Up from the bottom of the heap we creep</i>
<i>Sneak peek</i>

468
00:25:21,987 --> 00:25:25,423
<i>breakin' through the concrete</i>
<i>Tired of livin' in an occupied state</i>

469
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:27,617
<i>Other motherfuckers decidin' our fate</i>

470
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:30,058
<i>- Now see me!</i>
<i>- Jack you in the valley</i>

471
00:25:30,128 --> 00:25:32,426
<i>- Now see me!</i>
<i>- Ice you in the alley</i>

472
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:35,564
<i>- Pull you out the truck</i>
<i>- Now see me!</i>

473
00:25:35,634 --> 00:25:37,898
<i>- I don't give a fuck!</i>
<i>- Now see me!</i>

474
00:25:37,969 --> 00:25:40,267
<i>- Burn all this shit down</i>
<i>- Now see me!</i>

475
00:25:40,338 --> 00:25:43,000
<i>Terrorize this town</i>
<i>Guerrillas in the midst</i>

476
00:25:43,642 --> 00:25:46,770
In the world of rap, N.W.H.,
also known as Niggaz With Hats...

477
00:25:46,845 --> 00:25:50,474
have a surprise hit with their latest single,
<i>Guerrillas in the Midst.</i>

478
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:53,143
The song, off the <i>group's</i>
<i>Fear of a Black Hat</i> album...

479
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:56,153
has also stirred the contempt
of many community organizations...

480
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:59,019
which are upset with the <i>group's</i> policy
of racial retaliation.

481
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:02,355
This group is an affront
to every decent American.

482
00:26:02,794 --> 00:26:05,262
Just listen to some of these song titles:

483
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:06,958
<i>Booty Juice...</i>

484
00:26:07,499 --> 00:26:10,161
<i>Back in the Ho Life Again, Ho Down...</i>

485
00:26:10,435 --> 00:26:12,767
<i>Suck my D-*- C-K...</i>

486
00:26:13,171 --> 00:26:18,165
<i>If Your Mama Don't Shut the F-*- C-K Up</i>
<i>I'm Going to Shoot the B-*- T-C-H.</i>

487
00:26:19,444 --> 00:26:22,004
And now this: <i>Guerrillas in the Midst.</i>

488
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,976
Ice Cold of N.W.H. Says <i>it's</i> funny
no one complained about...

489
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:28,247
their earlier albums,
which included <i>P.U.S.S. Why?</i>

490
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,754
<i>Straight Outta Da Butt, Garden Ho's...</i>

491
00:26:30,822 --> 00:26:34,280
and <i>Ho Ho Ho's,</i> a Christmas release
that featured the group singing:

492
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:37,453
<i>"Santa Claus is coming,
and not necessarily to <i>town."</i>

493
00:26:37,529 --> 00:26:39,759
Ice says, "You can talk
about <i>ho's</i> all you want...

494
00:26:39,831 --> 00:26:43,289
<i>"but when you start talking about
the real deal, everyone starts <i>bugging."</i>

495
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:46,799
<i>Everyone's</i> bugging pushed sales
of the <i>Fear of a Black Hat</i> album...

496
00:26:46,871 --> 00:26:49,704
to number one this week
in record stores across the country.

497
00:26:52,143 --> 00:26:55,704
Guerrillas in the Midst
<i>made N. W.H. Rap superstars.</i>

498
00:26:57,649 --> 00:27:00,049
Fear of a Black Hat <i>went platinum.</i>

499
00:27:07,058 --> 00:27:10,027
No N.W. H!

500
00:27:12,897 --> 00:27:15,661
<i>I'm</i> glad y'all could make it
down here to the gig.

501
00:27:15,734 --> 00:27:17,827
Because this is going to be some other shit.

502
00:27:17,902 --> 00:27:20,370
Check this out. Check out the new gear.

503
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,733
<i>I'm</i> in there. Check out the hood.

504
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:25,435
And then, the shit underneath.

505
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:28,946
When I want to get crazy buck-wild ill
on a motherfucker.

506
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,240
On your ass.

507
00:27:30,415 --> 00:27:31,677
This is some other shit.

508
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:34,480
This is some <i>Horton Hears a Who!</i> type shit.

509
00:27:34,786 --> 00:27:36,913
You know, because <i>I'm</i> all into that.

510
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:39,047
<i>I'm</i> gonna introduce you to someone.

511
00:27:39,124 --> 00:27:41,820
<i>There's</i> some crazy motherfuckers
on this tour.

512
00:27:42,761 --> 00:27:46,288
- Word up.
- Yo, that shit was fucked up, G!

513
00:27:46,865 --> 00:27:48,696
- Are we still cool?
- Yeah, man.

514
00:27:48,767 --> 00:27:51,258
- Y'all remember Vanilla Sherbet.
- <i>What's</i> up, man?

515
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:53,065
We had to jack him a little bit.

516
00:27:53,138 --> 00:27:55,333
- We still chilling though, right, G?
- Yeah.

517
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:57,771
You still seeing that dude
about your nerves?

518
00:27:57,842 --> 00:28:00,106
Yeah, I got the cast off last week.
But we in there.

519
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:01,839
- All right, money.
- All right.

520
00:28:01,913 --> 00:28:03,710
Yeah, this is my man, here.

521
00:28:04,549 --> 00:28:08,645
M.C. Slammer.
All the dance moves for your behind.

522
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,950
Homeboy, I dropped the M.C.

523
00:28:11,056 --> 00:28:14,651
<i>It's</i> just Slammer now.
Slammer, <i>that's</i> what it is.

524
00:28:14,726 --> 00:28:16,557
Yeah. Come on.

525
00:28:16,661 --> 00:28:18,754
This motherfucker spits
when he say that stuff.

526
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:22,061
<i>That's</i> why people call him
M.C. Stammer behind the back.

527
00:28:22,333 --> 00:28:24,927
- Yeah, N.W.H.
- They know what they <i>talkin'</i> about.

528
00:28:25,003 --> 00:28:27,665
- N.W.H. Is where <i>it's</i> at.
- Check it out.

529
00:28:27,739 --> 00:28:29,832
N.W.H. I'll do everything he says.

530
00:28:29,908 --> 00:28:32,399
- They are really hot.
- <i>What's</i> your favorite song?

531
00:28:32,477 --> 00:28:35,446
- <i>Bald and Buried, I'd</i> say.
- Yeah. <i>That's</i> a good one.

532
00:28:35,513 --> 00:28:36,946
What about you?

533
00:28:37,482 --> 00:28:39,848
You know my favorite: <i>Peanuts in My Pants.</i>

534
00:28:39,918 --> 00:28:42,819
You know <i>what's</i> funny:
I used to have peanuts in my pants...

535
00:28:42,954 --> 00:28:45,752
all the time and then
they wrote a song about it.

536
00:28:47,525 --> 00:28:51,222
<i>I'm</i> a producer. This is somebody
<i>I'm</i> getting ready to produce.

537
00:28:51,296 --> 00:28:52,661
<i>What's</i> your name?

538
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:56,659
Wait just a minute! You produce her?

539
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:58,760
You said you supposed to produce me.

540
00:28:59,003 --> 00:29:02,905
<i>Don't</i> try that. You been talking that mess
since I met you five months ago...

541
00:29:02,974 --> 00:29:04,908
on the street, okay?
Who do you think you are?

542
00:29:04,976 --> 00:29:06,739
You cannot treat me like that, honey.

543
00:29:06,811 --> 00:29:08,438
Let me tell you something:

544
00:29:08,513 --> 00:29:12,005
<i>Don't</i> listen to him, okay?
He is tired, honey, okay?

545
00:29:13,318 --> 00:29:15,582
<i>It's</i> rough being me,
you know what <i>I'm</i> saying?

546
00:29:15,653 --> 00:29:17,143
This is Yo Highness.

547
00:29:17,889 --> 00:29:19,880
I <i>ain't</i> wanna fuck with that.

548
00:29:19,958 --> 00:29:23,155
And this is
Parsley, Sage, Rosemary <i>N'</i> Thyme.

549
00:29:23,528 --> 00:29:26,088
- Straight from the Bronx.
- We better than Salt <i>'n</i> Pepa.

550
00:29:26,164 --> 00:29:29,964
- Yeah, they just two spices, we four.
- And they common spices.

551
00:29:30,802 --> 00:29:33,168
Over here we got some perpetrators.

552
00:29:33,538 --> 00:29:35,631
A bunch of Ice wannabes.

553
00:29:35,707 --> 00:29:37,902
See, Ice Cold, <i>I'm</i> the man. But we got:

554
00:29:37,976 --> 00:29:41,309
Ice Tray, Ice Coffee, Ice Water...

555
00:29:41,513 --> 00:29:45,813
Ice Berg, Ice Cup, Ice Box.

556
00:29:45,884 --> 00:29:49,149
I mean, it gets real ridiculous
when people try to bite your style.

557
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:52,383
You know what <i>I'm</i> saying?
<i>That's</i> the way it is. This is the rap world.

558
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:53,685
What can I tell you?

559
00:29:53,758 --> 00:29:54,747
Hold up!

560
00:29:55,593 --> 00:29:58,494
- Kill that noise.
- We got to change the lineup here!

561
00:29:58,563 --> 00:30:00,030
Fuck my ass, man!

562
00:30:00,098 --> 00:30:02,862
<i>There's</i> some groups
that had some hits last week.

We keep our stuff current.

564
00:30:04,402 --> 00:30:06,768
We're changing the lineup.
George, run it down.

565
00:30:06,838 --> 00:30:08,305
Yo, listen up.

566
00:30:09,407 --> 00:30:11,637
Opening up gonna be Touch & Groove...

567
00:30:12,043 --> 00:30:14,671
followed by Vanilla Sherbet,
then Yo Highness.

568
00:30:14,746 --> 00:30:17,306
Then Parsley, Sage, Rosemary <i>N'</i> Thyme...

569
00:30:17,382 --> 00:30:20,681
followed by The Jam Boys,
then followed by N.W.H.

570
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:25,789
- How you gonna put these...
- In the house.

571
00:30:26,057 --> 00:30:28,787
...whatnots in front
of the money-making Jam Boys!

572
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:30,919
Simple, because they got the hit.

573
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:33,463
It <i>shouldn't</i> be The Jam Boys.
It should be "Special <i>Guest."</i>

574
00:30:33,531 --> 00:30:35,260
Son of a bitch, fuck you!

575
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,800
Slammer will close the show.

576

<i>That's</i> it, <i>it's</i> over,

N.W.H. In the house!

579
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:50,909
Sounds to me like somebody
had to take a step back tonight.

580
00:30:52,884 --> 00:30:53,908
Fuck y'all!

581
00:30:53,985 --> 00:30:56,852

You niggas is over.

<i>Excusez-moi.</i>

583
00:30:58,389 --> 00:31:01,187
Do not call them niggas. Just these three.

584
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:02,317
Appreciate it.

585
00:31:02,393 --> 00:31:03,792
Did I say "niggas"?

586
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:05,625
I meant pussies.

587
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:08,221
Fuck this. Fuck them, man.

588
00:31:11,569 --> 00:31:12,558
Hurt.

589
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:14,795
Let me call you right back.

590
00:31:17,308 --> 00:31:20,607
I know this might not be
the right time to mention this...

591
00:31:20,678 --> 00:31:25,479
but I've heard that your last five managers
were killed, also by gunfire.

592
00:31:25,984 --> 00:31:28,179
Yeah, but they was all accidents.

593
00:31:28,253 --> 00:31:31,984
- I mean, except for Whitey Dilucca.
- We <i>don't</i> know what happened to him.

594
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:33,216
Yeah, we do.

595
00:31:34,792 --> 00:31:37,192
Oh, yeah. I forgot. We <i>don't</i> know.

596
00:31:37,795 --> 00:31:41,231
A lot of people been coming down on us...

597
00:31:41,299 --> 00:31:45,065
because a lot of our managers are white.
But <i>there's</i> a very good reason for that.

598
00:31:45,136 --> 00:31:48,435
And this is it:
Our first few managers was black.

599
00:31:48,506 --> 00:31:51,202
And, in fact, they was our cousins,
you know.

600
00:31:51,276 --> 00:31:55,406
So we just decided it would be better
for the black community...

601
00:31:55,480 --> 00:32:00,042
and our relatives, if we just started
having white managers from now on.

602
00:32:00,285 --> 00:32:04,312
But make no mistake,
we hate to see Friesch go.

603
00:32:04,389 --> 00:32:08,018
<i>It's</i> going to be hard for us
to go out there and perform.

604
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:09,351
Real hard.

605
00:32:09,494 --> 00:32:11,018
N.W.H., you on in five.

606
00:32:12,363 --> 00:32:15,230
Well, we can get over this shit if we have to.

607
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:17,427
- <i>Let's</i> go.
- Turn these beepers off.

608
00:32:19,804 --> 00:32:23,035
So now, were you guys, as they say,
down with the riots?

609
00:32:23,408 --> 00:32:27,003
We was out of town.
That brother on TV just look like me.

610
00:32:27,145 --> 00:32:29,443
No, I mean, did you agree with the riots?

611
00:32:29,514 --> 00:32:31,379
Oh, hell yeah, I mean...

612
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:36,318
the media was trying to say that the people
looting was lazy and <i>didn't</i> want to work.

613
00:32:36,387 --> 00:32:39,413
But I tell you what,
you try carrying a leather sofa...

614
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:42,050
all the way from Slauson and Crenshaw...

615
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:44,651
down to Pico or Venice
or <i>somethin'</i> like that...

616
00:32:44,729 --> 00:32:47,095
and then going back
for the matching end tables.

617
00:32:47,165 --> 00:32:49,531
<i>That's</i> some work for your ass.

618
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:53,127
Even with three niggas.
Plus you got to go through all that smoke.

619
00:32:53,204 --> 00:32:57,573
Yeah, but like T said,
we was out of town when the shit happened.

620
00:32:58,142 --> 00:33:02,408
So is it true that N.W.H. Is thinking about
putting a love song on the new album?

621
00:33:02,547 --> 00:33:05,380
Oh, yeah.
Tasty got that, <i>he's hookin'</i> that up.

622
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:06,849
Yeah, check this out.

623
00:33:06,918 --> 00:33:10,877
<i>I want to make you mine</i>
<i>slap your fat behind</i>

624
00:33:10,955 --> 00:33:13,355
<i>Tie you down and make you whine</i>

625
00:33:13,424 --> 00:33:17,417
<i>I want you to scratch my itch</i>
<i>And be my bitch</i>

626
00:33:17,895 --> 00:33:19,487
<i>Because I love you girl</i>

627
00:33:19,564 --> 00:33:23,432
I think that just shows
his whole vulnerability.

628
00:33:23,701 --> 00:33:27,899
The black man was the first sensitive man,
long before Alan Alda.

629
00:33:27,972 --> 00:33:31,931
You know, there are some people
that think you guys are misogynists.

630
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:35,136
A misogynist is a person that hates women.

631
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:36,769
We love women.

632
00:33:37,115 --> 00:33:40,744
<i>It's</i> our civic duty to bang the booty.

633
00:33:41,386 --> 00:33:44,480
You tend to justify most of the things
that the group does...

634
00:33:44,555 --> 00:33:47,786
in political terms.
On your song <i>Booty Juice...</i>

635
00:33:48,126 --> 00:33:50,151
<i>what's</i> the political significance?

636
00:33:50,228 --> 00:33:52,128
The butt is like society...

637
00:33:52,196 --> 00:33:56,496
which we want to see as being
openness and expansion. You understand?

638
00:33:56,801 --> 00:33:59,929
But the white man wants to clog it up,
keep it closed.

639
00:34:00,138 --> 00:34:03,039
And we <i>tryin'</i> to get
a foot up in that motherfucker.

640
00:34:03,107 --> 00:34:05,837
So the easiest way
to get your foot in there is...

641
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:07,775
if <i>it's</i> all greased up and ready.

642
00:34:07,845 --> 00:34:11,645
The butt, that is, a.k.a. Society. Right?

643
00:34:11,749 --> 00:34:14,240
So what we're saying with <i>Booty Juice</i> is:

644
00:34:14,318 --> 00:34:16,946
When is your butt at its most juiciest?

645
00:34:17,655 --> 00:34:18,986
When you dancing.

646
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:21,582
When you doing the nasty,
and stuff like that.

647
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:24,560
I <i>don't</i> know. I <i>can't</i> speak
for your butt, personally...

648
00:34:24,629 --> 00:34:26,392
But I got some suspicions about it.

649
00:34:26,464 --> 00:34:30,264
But anyhow, the thing is, you want
that sucker nice and greased for you to...

650
00:34:30,334 --> 00:34:33,633
slide on in there.
And on the political tip, all we <i>sayin'</i> is:

651
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:35,569
We gonna get that ass.

652
00:34:39,777 --> 00:34:42,177
<i>That booty juice</i>

653
00:34:44,816 --> 00:34:46,943
<i>Booty juice comes right from the source</i>

654
00:34:47,018 --> 00:34:49,111
<i>What's the source? An ass, of course</i>

655
00:34:49,187 --> 00:34:51,246
<i>The kind that spreads out extra wide</i>

656
00:34:51,322 --> 00:34:53,290
<i>The kind that's nice when you come inside</i>

657
00:34:53,357 --> 00:34:57,191
<i>It's fresh and ain't all pasteurized</i>
<i>But I always rise when I tap the thighs</i>

658
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:59,661
<i>'Cause I like 'em big, I like 'em greasy</i>

659
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:01,664
<i>I like 'em round, and I like 'em easy</i>

660
00:35:01,732 --> 00:35:03,632
<i>I like it when the girls step on the floor</i>

661
00:35:03,701 --> 00:35:05,566
<i>Shakin' them booties just like a ho</i>

662
00:35:05,636 --> 00:35:08,104
<i>I like it when it shakes in the pants so loose</i>

663
00:35:08,172 --> 00:35:10,037
<i>but I love it when it's drippin'</i>

664
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:11,700
<i>that booty juice</i>

665
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:14,870
You know, the other night
I went to see the N.W.H. Show.

666
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:18,313
Just so I could see
what it was like for myself, firsthand.

667
00:35:18,416 --> 00:35:21,010
And when I got there,
I <i>couldn't</i> believe my eyes.

668
00:35:21,085 --> 00:35:23,553
<i>Women, dressed like harlots.</i>

669
00:35:23,754 --> 00:35:26,086
<i>Shakin' everything that God give them!</i>

670
00:35:26,524 --> 00:35:30,085
And they are going to wring
their drawers out! On-stage!

671
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:31,617
Panties!

672
00:35:32,029 --> 00:35:35,760
Full of sin.
All the freaks was all out their minds.

673
00:35:35,933 --> 00:35:37,901
And let me hear you say,
<i>"Freaks in the house."</i>

674
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:38,958
Freaks in the house!

675
00:35:54,018 --> 00:35:54,085
Welcome to my establishment.

676
00:35:54,085 --> 00:35:55,985
Welcome to my establishment.

677
00:35:56,287 --> 00:35:58,721
I'll show you my new book <i>I'm</i> working on.

678
00:35:58,789 --> 00:36:02,122
- <i>FYM</i> by Ice.
- <i>FYM?</i>

679
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:04,885
Yeah, Fuck Y'all Motherfuckers.

680
00:36:05,963 --> 00:36:07,260
<i>That's</i> a strong title.

681
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:09,959
Yeah, because it was written
from a strong mindset.

682
00:36:10,034 --> 00:36:13,128
You know how when people mess
with you or put you through shit?

683
00:36:13,371 --> 00:36:17,364
And you feel bad, and then
they put you through some more shit.

684
00:36:17,542 --> 00:36:19,840
And <i>it's</i> like, you get tired of it.

685
00:36:19,911 --> 00:36:22,004
And you feel just like FYM.

686
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:24,280
Fuck Y'all Motherfuckers.

687
00:36:24,382 --> 00:36:26,873
And <i>that's</i> what
the whole riots was all about.

688
00:36:26,951 --> 00:36:29,943
The riots was one big FYM.

689
00:36:30,054 --> 00:36:31,521
Fuck Y'all Motherfuckers.

690
00:36:31,923 --> 00:36:33,857
Are you planning a follow-up to this book?

691
00:36:33,925 --> 00:36:36,553
For certain, because I got a lot more to say.

692
00:36:36,627 --> 00:36:39,289
I think <i>it's</i> going to be called <i>ASMD.</i>

693
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:41,097
And Suck My Dick.

694
00:36:41,265 --> 00:36:45,702
You know, I was going to have it <i>ASMBD,</i>
And Suck My Black Dick.

695
00:36:45,803 --> 00:36:49,170
But <i>I'm</i> a mocha-colored motherfucker,
so that <i>didn't</i> really work.

696
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:53,108
Besides, that was four letters
and it <i>didn't</i> really fit here that well.

697
00:36:53,611 --> 00:36:57,479
But this is gonna be a two-volume set
because I've got a lot of shit to say.

698
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:00,745
Excuse me, what is this?

699
00:37:01,452 --> 00:37:04,182
You got the picture that I sent Chaka.

700
00:37:04,255 --> 00:37:07,816
This is my pride and joy, my son Chaka.
And this is his mama, Re-Re.

701
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:10,986
Rebecca. I told you not to dress
that boy up like that.

702
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:15,294
And I told you not to have him hanging out
with these knotty-haired gangsters.

703
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:16,764
This boy can rap.

704
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:20,234
And I'll team him up with Chaka,
because Chaka wants to be a rapper.

705
00:37:20,304 --> 00:37:23,796
I got a whole thing going on here,
check this out.

706
00:37:24,108 --> 00:37:27,703
I put the pants over his head.
<i>That's</i> his head sticking out of the crotch.

707
00:37:27,778 --> 00:37:31,714
Down there, I've got his feet coming
out of the shirt armpit holes...

708
00:37:31,782 --> 00:37:34,250
and then I turn him upside down...

709
00:37:34,318 --> 00:37:36,809
gonna have him rap like that,
walk around on his hands.

710
00:37:36,887 --> 00:37:40,789
He gonna knock Kris Kross out the box
because he gonna be upside down.

711
00:37:42,026 --> 00:37:45,257
<i>What's</i> it take to get through to you?
The boy <i>won't</i> be <i>anyone's</i> rapper.

712
00:37:46,397 --> 00:37:48,262
- Dude, toss it over here.
- This is lovely.

713
00:37:48,332 --> 00:37:50,698
Yeah. I like it a lot.

714
00:37:53,537 --> 00:37:55,596
Here you go, my European brother.

715
00:37:58,976 --> 00:38:01,672
You see, I <i>don't</i> know all the neighbors yet.

716
00:38:01,746 --> 00:38:04,237
- I kinda just moved in.
- In time, <i>I'm</i> sure.

717
00:38:04,715 --> 00:38:07,582
You see over there?
On the tippity top of the hill?

718
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:10,720
- <i>That's</i> where I live.
- That one with the red top?

719
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:13,552
<i>That's</i> right. I even got a shooting range.
You want to see it?

720
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:15,489
- <i>I'd</i> love to.
- <i>Let's</i> go.

721
00:38:15,559 --> 00:38:17,390
Never let him touch your soccer ball.

722
00:38:21,265 --> 00:38:22,562
<i>That's</i> very impressive.

723
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:24,999
See, <i>I'm</i> going to be ready. Come on.

724
00:38:25,069 --> 00:38:26,058
Duck!

725
00:38:30,041 --> 00:38:31,167
My God!

726
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:34,141
Yeah. I hate that motherfucker, too.

727
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:43,009
See? The cops would have shot homeboy.

728
00:38:43,554 --> 00:38:45,954
But I know better. He was just chilling.

729
00:38:47,224 --> 00:38:49,089
This is my pride and joy.

730
00:38:51,062 --> 00:38:52,791
You sure? It says "danger."

731
00:38:52,863 --> 00:38:54,194
Yeah, come on.

732
00:39:00,638 --> 00:39:02,833
Now, why do you need all these guns?

733
00:39:03,274 --> 00:39:06,038
You see, <i>guns...</i>
When they talk about gun control...

734
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:08,874
they <i>talkin'</i> about taking away
our guns so they can control us.

735
00:39:08,946 --> 00:39:10,413
It <i>ain't</i> that kind of party.

736
00:39:10,481 --> 00:39:14,144
So <i>I'm</i> going to be packing and strapping
because T <i>ain't</i> napping.

737
00:39:15,252 --> 00:39:17,345
<i>What's</i> this one? What is that?

738
00:39:17,621 --> 00:39:20,181
This is a very good choice, little chickadee.

739
00:39:20,591 --> 00:39:23,992
You got eyes for this.
This is an Uzi, fully automatic.

740
00:39:24,128 --> 00:39:26,961
I guess you have to really know
what you're doing to use one.

741
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:29,261
No, this is a good jammy for beginners.

742
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:32,198
I mean, this is better
than those auto-focus cameras.

743
00:39:32,269 --> 00:39:34,430
You just spray the area.

744
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:38,231
Do you know the caliber of all these guns?

745
00:39:39,243 --> 00:39:43,145
Yeah, this one here is
for the little motherfuckers.

746
00:39:43,247 --> 00:39:45,306
This one here is for...

747
00:39:45,449 --> 00:39:47,542
a couple more motherfuckers.

748
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:51,286
And this here is for big motherfuckers.

749
00:39:52,123 --> 00:39:55,388
- Are they registered with the state?
- State of siege.

750
00:39:56,527 --> 00:39:58,688
Let me show you something else
before we go.

751
00:39:58,763 --> 00:40:02,665
I just want to show you this.
This is some Wile E. Coyote Acme shit.

752
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:06,536
The reason I got this is because
every time I watch them cartoons...

753
00:40:06,604 --> 00:40:10,836
this shit be blowing motherfuckers up.
So, I figured I should use it.

754
00:40:11,308 --> 00:40:14,539
The first thing you gotta do
is put this piece of paper in here...

755
00:40:14,612 --> 00:40:18,013
to keep the hole tight,
because nobody likes a sloppy hole.

756
00:40:18,349 --> 00:40:21,944
<i>You'd</i> be slipping out
if you <i>don't</i> have that in there.

757
00:40:22,019 --> 00:40:24,817
That pisses everybody off,
especially the ladies.

758
00:40:56,587 --> 00:40:59,055
Careful, the ladies especially like this one.

759
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:02,286
The average motherfucker <i>can't</i> do this.

760
00:41:04,628 --> 00:41:07,859
You gotta have some lead
in your dick for this one.

761
00:41:13,904 --> 00:41:15,303
Smooth ride.

762
00:41:15,706 --> 00:41:17,867
I notice you have three pagers.

763
00:41:18,175 --> 00:41:21,201
- <i>Yeah. Uno, dos, tres.</i>
- Why?

764
00:41:21,512 --> 00:41:25,312
I gotta be able to stay in touch
with everything I gotta stay in touch with.

765
00:41:27,685 --> 00:41:31,451
See, this is the kind of shit that they do.
This is what I am talking about.

766
00:41:31,522 --> 00:41:34,787
A brother was minding his own business.
I got some shit for their ass...

767
00:41:34,859 --> 00:41:37,760
because this is my pooky right here.
It <i>ain't</i> even a thing.

768
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:39,056
Fuck them!

769
00:41:39,196 --> 00:41:41,892
All right, put your hands
where we can see them.

770
00:41:42,233 --> 00:41:44,258
Both of you, put your hands up!

771
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:47,031
I got a lot of coffee and donuts in me,
<i>don't</i> push me!

772
00:41:47,104 --> 00:41:50,198
You're not even a <i>fucking...</i>
You're a fucking security guard!

773
00:41:50,274 --> 00:41:53,402
This gun will kill you just as good
as a real cop, you got that?

774
00:41:53,477 --> 00:41:55,707
Now, move it slowly.

775
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:58,905
Put your left hand outside the car.

776
00:41:59,149 --> 00:42:02,846
Take your right hand,
and putting it over your left hand...

777
00:42:03,053 --> 00:42:06,250
taking your forefinger and your thumb
from your right <i>hand...</i>

778
00:42:06,323 --> 00:42:08,917
Hey! I said, forefinger, Mr. Fun.

779
00:42:09,727 --> 00:42:12,127
Reach down and open the car door.

780
00:42:12,596 --> 00:42:15,827
You're a little jokester, <i>ain't</i> you?
Big old puffy hat!

781
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:18,869
Now take your left foot
and push the car door open.

782
00:42:18,936 --> 00:42:20,460
Can I let go of the door now?

783
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:23,371
Let go of the door,
push it with your left foot.

784
00:42:23,807 --> 00:42:27,004
Bring your right foot over,
next to your left foot.

785
00:42:27,778 --> 00:42:30,906
Now stand up, get your ass out of the car.

786
00:42:34,084 --> 00:42:36,018
- Hands up.
- They're up!

787
00:42:36,954 --> 00:42:39,548
Now, take your right <i>buttock...</i>

788
00:42:40,758 --> 00:42:42,385
- Close that door!
- With what?

789
00:42:42,459 --> 00:42:43,858
Right cheek.

790
00:42:45,496 --> 00:42:48,056
<i>Don't</i> get smart, <i>I'm</i> looking for an excuse.

791
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:50,692
Now, get your ass on the car.

792
00:42:54,038 --> 00:42:55,403
Turn around!

793
00:42:55,472 --> 00:42:58,032
Get your hands on the car, funny man.

794
00:42:58,175 --> 00:43:01,406
Real funny with a big goddamned
donut hat on, are you?

795
00:43:01,478 --> 00:43:03,503
Now, you take that hat off...

796
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:05,549
and no <i>one's</i> gonna get hurt,
how about that?

797
00:43:05,616 --> 00:43:06,810
Take my hat off?

798
00:43:06,884 --> 00:43:08,852
Take the fucking hat off.

799
00:43:09,286 --> 00:43:12,255
Yo, motherfucker, nobody tells me
to take my hat off.

800
00:43:12,323 --> 00:43:14,814
See, <i>that's</i> the way they try to do you.

801
00:43:14,892 --> 00:43:17,827
They take a black <i>man's</i> hat,
but that <i>ain't</i> happening no more.

802
00:43:17,895 --> 00:43:21,490
I got this camera crew, y'all,
and I got all these people here.

803
00:43:21,565 --> 00:43:24,557
We learned from that Rodney King stuff.
It <i>ain't</i> happening again.

804
00:43:24,635 --> 00:43:28,230
I even got a brother over here
drawing the stuff, courtroom-style.

805
00:43:28,305 --> 00:43:29,363
You know what <i>I'm</i> saying?

806
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:32,773
Just in case the tape and stuff runs out
and <i>doesn't</i> come up.

807
00:43:32,843 --> 00:43:35,368
- This shit <i>ain't</i> happening again.
- Eureka.

808
00:43:36,947 --> 00:43:38,312
<i>Don't</i> tell me.

809
00:43:38,649 --> 00:43:41,140
You shot the sheriff,
but you did not shoot the deputy.

810
00:43:41,218 --> 00:43:44,119
Man, I got permits for both of them guns,
all right?

811
00:43:44,822 --> 00:43:46,551
- Sure you do.
- <i>I'm</i> serious.

812
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:48,455
<i>Here's</i> his registration, okay?

813
00:43:48,525 --> 00:43:51,892
- What the hell is this?
- <i>That's</i> me and the guy that sold me the car.

814
00:43:51,962 --> 00:43:54,931
I want America to see this.
Is that cool for you? Check it out.

815
00:43:54,999 --> 00:43:56,523
<i>That's</i> me, right there.

816
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:59,569
<i>That's</i> the white guy that sold me the car
in a checkered jacket.

817
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:02,231
Paid for it in cash. Cash money!

818
00:44:02,506 --> 00:44:04,633
The guy who sold him the car.

819
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:10,940
The only crime I can get you on now
is taking a real shitty picture.

820
00:44:11,015 --> 00:44:12,812
You're lucky this time.

821
00:44:12,883 --> 00:44:16,842
I <i>don't</i> want you around here no more,
because <i>that's</i> when your luck will run out.

822
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:21,549
Fucking $3.35 an hour, minimum wage.

823
00:44:21,825 --> 00:44:24,191
Get a decent job, you can buy a car.

824
00:44:25,729 --> 00:44:28,823
See, <i>that's</i> the way they do you.
See what <i>I'm</i> talking about?

825
00:44:28,899 --> 00:44:30,867
Get a real job, you can get a real car.

826
00:44:30,934 --> 00:44:34,392
Quit driving that toy shit
with little lights on top of it.

827
00:44:34,471 --> 00:44:37,736
That reminds me of that song
you guys <i>wrote. Fuck the Security Guard.</i>

828
00:44:37,808 --> 00:44:38,809
<i>That's</i> why we wrote that song.

829
00:44:38,809 --> 00:44:40,003
<i>That's</i> why we wrote that song.

830
00:44:40,177 --> 00:44:43,112
Look at that motherfucking
security guard staring at us.

831
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:45,671
The motherfucker <i>ain't</i> nothing
but a punk-ass bitch.

832
00:44:45,749 --> 00:44:48,650
Pissing me off.
I oughta bust a cap in his fat ass.

833
00:44:48,719 --> 00:44:51,017
Yo, what we gonna do?

834
00:44:51,288 --> 00:44:54,086
Just gonna piss on this motherfucker.

835
00:44:57,661 --> 00:45:02,598
<i>N. W.H. Say fuck the security guards</i>
<i>He ain't a cop but he still want to act hard</i>

836
00:45:02,666 --> 00:45:05,032
<i>On patrol at a goddamn convenience store</i>

837
00:45:05,102 --> 00:45:07,002
<i>Get in check</i>
<i>You just a chump minimum wage ho</i>

838
00:45:07,071 --> 00:45:08,936
<i>Just a slob in an ill-fittin' suit</i>

839
00:45:09,006 --> 00:45:11,236
<i>Got a little bit of power</i>
<i>so you want to act the fool</i>

840
00:45:11,308 --> 00:45:13,173
<i>Let some shit break out</i>
<i>and what you gonna do?</i>

841
00:45:13,243 --> 00:45:15,404
<i>Can't get backup</i>
<i>'cause you don't got a crew</i>

842
00:45:15,479 --> 00:45:17,674
<i>It seems like damn near every time I shop</i>

843
00:45:17,748 --> 00:45:20,148
<i>I'm always getting clocked</i>
<i>by some wannabe cop</i>

844
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:24,779
<i>Follows me around like a magnet</i>
<i>Eyes on my ass like a two-bit faggot</i>

845
00:45:24,855 --> 00:45:27,483
<i>Why it gotta be I'm treated like a thief?</i>
<i>Because I'm black</i>

846
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:28,923
<i>and wear a pager on my jeans?</i>

847
00:45:28,992 --> 00:45:31,392
<i>So it seems</i>
<i>I'm gonna have to set the sucker straight</i>

848
00:45:31,462 --> 00:45:33,430
<i>I turn around and say</i>
<i>"Yo, get out my face"</i>

849
00:45:33,497 --> 00:45:35,692
<i>An he wastes no time</i>
<i>pointin' to his fake badge</i>

850
00:45:35,766 --> 00:45:37,927
<i>and nightstick that</i>
<i>can make a nigga hemorrhage</i>

851
00:45:38,001 --> 00:45:40,333
<i>He got cuffs, some mace</i>
<i>and a gat on his hip</i>

852
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:42,463
<i>he makes a move but Ice Cold don't trip</i>

853
00:45:42,539 --> 00:45:44,769
<i>'Cause I'm wearin' my hat</i>
<i>and the shit feels good</i>

854
00:45:44,842 --> 00:45:47,003
<i>besides all that</i>
<i>I'm straight out the neighborhood</i>

855
00:45:47,077 --> 00:45:48,476
<i>With flow I pull my AK-47</i>

856
00:45:48,545 --> 00:45:50,979
<i>gonna send an Acme rents punk cop</i>
<i>straight to heaven</i>

857
00:45:51,048 --> 00:45:53,516
<i>Oh, hell, who cares</i>
<i>where the motherfucker go</i>

858
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:55,643
<i>He's dead on the ground</i>
<i>when I let the trigger go</i>

859
00:45:55,719 --> 00:46:03,649
<i>Fuck the security guards</i>

860
00:46:04,828 --> 00:46:09,561
The association between rap and violence
is purely a "fictitional" thing...

861
00:46:09,633 --> 00:46:11,692
that is a result of media hype.

862
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:14,135
<i>'Cause N.W.H., we're anti-violent.

863
00:46:14,204 --> 00:46:16,672
I'll bust a cap in anybody
who thinks different.

864
00:46:17,508 --> 00:46:20,033
But <i>it's</i> true that you guys
are the only group...

865
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:22,544
to carry live weapons in your stage show.

866
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:25,377
Yeah, <i>that's</i> a result of some shit
that went down...

867
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:26,939
back in Cincinnati.

868
00:46:27,017 --> 00:46:31,283
<i>We used to carry fake AK-47s on-stage.</i>
<i>They was plastic, right?</i>

869
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:35,687
<i>We pulled the shit out in Cincinnati,</i>
<i>the audience pulled some shit out on us.</i>

870
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:39,823
<i>Silly, crazy banana weapons...</i>
<i>Stupid weapons, man.</i>

871
00:46:40,030 --> 00:46:41,793
<i>How was them niggas living, you know?</i>

872
00:46:41,865 --> 00:46:45,028
Since then, we be ready
for the knuckleheads who feeling froggy.

873
00:46:45,102 --> 00:46:48,503
Right, trying to come at us
with a little something extra.

874
00:46:48,572 --> 00:46:51,507
Besides that, we let people know
we <i>ain't</i> with the violence...

875
00:46:51,575 --> 00:46:53,566
by putting out our music in our videos.

876
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:56,511
Like we got one called
<i>A Gangsta's Life Ain't Fun.</i>

877
00:47:08,692 --> 00:47:13,254
<i>I'm a G-A-N-G-S-T-E-R</i>
<i>like Scarface, bitch, I'm a superstar</i>

878
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:15,423
<i>Revered by all though I am the villain</i>

879
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:17,592
<i>Gainin' more juice by the others I'm killin'</i>

880
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:19,659
<i>profilin' and stylin'</i>

881
00:47:19,736 --> 00:47:21,829
<i>Drive a fly ride and the hos just pile in</i>

882
00:47:21,905 --> 00:47:24,305
<i>I make gangster money</i>
<i>'cause I'm gangster bold</i>

883
00:47:24,374 --> 00:47:26,467
<i>Fuck gangster bitches</i>
<i>wearing gangster clothes</i>

884
00:47:26,543 --> 00:47:28,841
<i>and I kill by will with skillful thrills</i>

885
00:47:28,912 --> 00:47:32,905
<i>Another way to pay the bills</i>
<i>I'm the boy wonder, god of thunder</i>

886
00:47:32,983 --> 00:47:34,746
<i>Make a move and I'll put you under</i>

887
00:47:34,818 --> 00:47:39,084
<i>I'm notorious, I live glorious</i>
<i>I'm the fly gangster that remains victorious</i>

888
00:47:39,156 --> 00:47:43,320
<i>Get up in your top-shelf clothes</i>
<i>Cold fuckin' top-shelf hos</i>

889
00:47:43,393 --> 00:47:46,726
<i>I'm the man they call number one</i>
<i>Don't try this shit at home</i>

890
00:47:46,797 --> 00:47:48,162
<i>A gangsta's life ain't fun</i>

891
00:47:48,232 --> 00:47:51,167
<i>Tell 'em, that's the mad hatter Ice</i>
<i>Don't chill while he's schoolin'</i>

892
00:47:51,235 --> 00:47:54,864
<i>'Cause you'll be losing</i>
<i>We coming to you on the e-pod tip</i>

893
00:47:55,439 --> 00:47:55,539
<i>A gangsta's life ain't fun</i>

894
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:57,200
<i>A gangsta's life ain't fun</i>

895
00:47:57,274 --> 00:47:59,970
<i>Ain't no waitin' or hesitatin'</i>
<i>Just hype riff-baitin'</i>

896
00:48:00,043 --> 00:48:02,011
<i>'Cause N. W.H. Is</i>

897
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:05,207
Boys and girls, I think
we've all seen enough of that video.

898
00:48:06,283 --> 00:48:09,275
No, I think that we all get the message...

899
00:48:09,353 --> 00:48:11,719
that being a gangster <i>isn't</i> fun.

900
00:48:12,322 --> 00:48:16,588
And to reinforce that message,
we have some very special guests today.

901
00:48:17,761 --> 00:48:19,251
The Jam Boys.

902
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:23,097
And N.W.H.

903
00:48:25,636 --> 00:48:29,094
They have an important message,
so <i>let's</i> sit back and listen very closely.

904
00:48:29,172 --> 00:48:30,969
<i>Let's</i> start with N.W.H.

905
00:48:32,342 --> 00:48:35,072
Yo, y'all, N.W.H. In the house, right?

906
00:48:35,245 --> 00:48:38,806
We're here to tell you youngsters that
there is a lot of evils and ills...

907
00:48:38,882 --> 00:48:41,851
out there in the world we want you
to stay clear of.

908
00:48:42,019 --> 00:48:45,113
You gotta understand,
when we was y'all's age...

909
00:48:45,355 --> 00:48:48,722
we was already knocking off liquor stores
and stuff like that.

910
00:48:48,792 --> 00:48:51,590
You know what <i>I'm</i> saying?
Making serious ends.

911
00:48:51,662 --> 00:48:54,290
Word. If you wasn't, you was a punk.

912
00:48:54,364 --> 00:48:57,561
Let me tell you something,
these brothers are soft.

913
00:48:57,935 --> 00:49:00,233
You ever hear about Fort Knox?

914
00:49:00,570 --> 00:49:02,663
Tell them about Fort Knox.

915
00:49:04,741 --> 00:49:08,108
We <i>don't</i> wanna get into that
because <i>it's</i> still pending and all.

916
00:49:08,178 --> 00:49:11,306
Before this gets out of hand,
just let me say this.

917
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:12,809
Last year...

918
00:49:12,883 --> 00:49:16,046
there were $700 billion missing...

919
00:49:16,219 --> 00:49:18,380
from the <i>nation's</i> savings and loans.

920
00:49:19,890 --> 00:49:21,016
I <i>ain't</i> gonna say no more.

921
00:49:21,091 --> 00:49:24,083
<i>I'm</i> sure these gentlemen
<i>aren't</i> responsible...

922
00:49:24,161 --> 00:49:26,561
for any savings and loans fraud.

923
00:49:26,763 --> 00:49:30,324
You're right. They're too stupid
to think of something that brilliant.

924
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:32,391
They're too soft to even pull it off.

925
00:49:32,469 --> 00:49:35,370
Yeah, we about as soft as a cock
in a hen house.

926
00:49:35,439 --> 00:49:37,600
Look! How many times have you been shot?

927
00:49:37,674 --> 00:49:39,972
- Show them your wounds.
- No.

928
00:49:40,043 --> 00:49:42,375
No. They got little kids here.

929
00:49:42,446 --> 00:49:44,744
This <i>brother's</i> been shot 22 times.

930
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:47,841
Twenty-two times! He <i>ain't</i> got no blood!

931
00:49:48,318 --> 00:49:50,582
- Twenty-two times <i>ain't</i> nothing.
- Word!

932
00:49:50,654 --> 00:49:53,122
- Tasty-Taste was shot with a bazooka!
- Okay?

933
00:49:53,190 --> 00:49:54,817
What you talking about, tuba breath?

934
00:49:54,891 --> 00:49:57,416
Look at him, man! Just look at him.

935
00:49:57,661 --> 00:50:01,097
He was <i>6'4"</i> before he got capped!

936
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:04,095
Thank you, Toasty.

937
00:50:04,167 --> 00:50:05,327
Tasty.

938
00:50:07,437 --> 00:50:11,999
Excuse me, but I think the whole point
here was to uplift the children and...

939
00:50:12,075 --> 00:50:13,303
Shut up!

940
00:50:13,410 --> 00:50:15,742
- Drop the bomb on that nigga, man.
- Flying mission.

941
00:50:15,812 --> 00:50:18,178
Check this out, you want to see soft?

942
00:50:18,248 --> 00:50:22,514
Man, I was trying to be nice to you all,
because we Rappers Against Violence.

943
00:50:22,586 --> 00:50:24,918
And I did not want this stuff
to get out of hand...

944
00:50:24,988 --> 00:50:26,922
but check this out, here.

945
00:50:27,124 --> 00:50:30,924
My man here, he <i>ain't</i> even seen no 'hood.

946
00:50:31,094 --> 00:50:34,063
My man used to go to a prep school!

947
00:50:34,164 --> 00:50:35,927
That was a pimp school, man!

948
00:50:35,999 --> 00:50:39,162
Look at this, here. Prep school.
Look, my man.

949
00:50:39,236 --> 00:50:43,570
Class of '87. See? Bow tie, checkered pants.

950
00:50:43,907 --> 00:50:48,037
He was on the Glee Club.
My man was on the yearbook staff.

951
00:50:48,245 --> 00:50:50,179
He was the yearbook editor.

952
00:50:50,247 --> 00:50:54,240
How you going to be a hardcore
OG gangster editing a yearbook?

953
00:50:54,518 --> 00:50:56,986
Well, <i>that's</i> great!
That is such a cute picture.

954
00:50:57,054 --> 00:50:58,817
- Let us pass it around...
- Give me that!

955
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:02,052
Get that before I kick your ass,
you going to ruin our rep.

956
00:51:02,125 --> 00:51:04,889
<i>It's</i> uplifting for the kids
to see that kind of thing.

957
00:51:04,961 --> 00:51:08,488
Show them how much punk they was.
Show that piece of paper.

958
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:10,624
You're the punk-ass bitch!

959
00:51:20,544 --> 00:51:22,444
Save yourselves! I quit!

960
00:51:22,512 --> 00:51:23,979
<i>I'm</i> out of here!

961
00:51:33,824 --> 00:51:35,985
- Man, come here.
- Be right back.

962
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:39,896
I want to talk to him in private,
for just a second.

963
00:51:40,230 --> 00:51:41,959
Yo, man <i>what's</i> up?

964
00:51:42,232 --> 00:51:45,224
<i>What's</i> up with you and Cheryl?
She coming with us to Cincinnati?

965
00:51:45,302 --> 00:51:47,702
- Yeah, <i>ain't</i> no biggie.
- Y'all <i>ain't</i> like...

966
00:51:47,771 --> 00:51:49,238
We're just rolling.

967
00:51:49,306 --> 00:51:51,638
- All I got to say is, baby got a rep.
- Cheryl?

968
00:51:51,708 --> 00:51:54,541
Word, man!
<i>She's</i> been out there on the frontline.

969
00:51:54,611 --> 00:51:56,101
You crazy, man.

970
00:51:56,746 --> 00:51:58,043
<i>What's</i> up?

971
00:51:59,049 --> 00:52:01,074
Nothing, we just chilling.

972
00:52:01,218 --> 00:52:03,243
- Yeah, we just talking.
- About?

973
00:52:04,054 --> 00:52:05,988
- Nothing.
- About?

974
00:52:07,057 --> 00:52:11,084
Some nigga talking out the side that
he heard some shit about you.

975
00:52:11,828 --> 00:52:13,489
<i>What'd</i> you hear?

976
00:52:13,964 --> 00:52:16,762
Man, you got a big mouth.
Nothing, I hear nothing.

977
00:52:16,833 --> 00:52:18,164
I wanna know.

978
00:52:18,535 --> 00:52:21,936
Well, he heard some shit about you.
He heard that you've been around.

979
00:52:22,005 --> 00:52:23,063
Around?

980
00:52:24,107 --> 00:52:26,575
<i>That's</i> what I heard.
I heard you've been around.

981
00:52:26,643 --> 00:52:28,873
I heard you had been, like,
hither and thither.

982
00:52:28,945 --> 00:52:32,176
To and fro. Near and far. Yonder and closer.

983
00:52:32,249 --> 00:52:34,843
- Left and right. Back and forth.
- We got it.

984
00:52:34,918 --> 00:52:38,376
- So <i>that's</i> what you heard?
- Yeah! <i>That's</i> just a rumor. Right?

985
00:52:38,455 --> 00:52:41,822
Yeah, baby. Remember what
I told you about jealousy?

986
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:44,551
<i>It's</i> a motherfucker.

987
00:52:45,462 --> 00:52:47,953
But <i>I'm</i> with you. You my baby.

988
00:52:48,165 --> 00:52:50,429
- Please do not let that fool ruin us.
- I won't.

989
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:52,764
Okay, baby. My baby.

990
00:52:53,703 --> 00:52:55,830
You go ahead. I'll catch up.
I gotta get my bag.

991
00:52:55,906 --> 00:52:57,373
All right, hurry up.

992
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:00,705
Damn this nigga. <i>She's playin'</i> his ass.

993
00:53:01,811 --> 00:53:03,403
Do you have a problem with me?

994
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:06,142
Yo, I just <i>don't</i> wanna see my boy
get played like that.

995
00:53:06,216 --> 00:53:08,480
I mean, <i>that's</i> my boy.
I gotta look out for him.

996
00:53:08,552 --> 00:53:10,383
No, do you have a problem with me?

997
00:53:10,453 --> 00:53:13,320
What <i>I'm</i> saying is: I've known
this motherfucker for a long time.

998
00:53:13,390 --> 00:53:15,153
Do you have a problem with me?

999
00:53:15,692 --> 00:53:18,752
I've known this motherfucker
before you were here. All right.

1000
00:53:18,828 --> 00:53:20,819
Before you were thought about.

1001
00:53:20,897 --> 00:53:24,094
Well, <i>I'm</i> with him now.
Do you have a problem with me?

1002
00:53:24,167 --> 00:53:25,634
I just might.

1003
00:53:29,706 --> 00:53:30,798
Cool.

1004
00:53:39,349 --> 00:53:41,408
So, now, you're Cheryl C.

1005
00:53:41,484 --> 00:53:43,884
And I notice you've hooked up with Tasty.

1006
00:53:43,954 --> 00:53:45,546
How did that happen?

1007
00:53:45,622 --> 00:53:48,420
<i>Let's</i> see. Tasty and <i>I...</i>

1008
00:53:51,461 --> 00:53:53,929
- Who are you?
- <i>I'm</i> sorry. <i>I'm</i> Nina Blackburn.

1009
00:53:53,997 --> 00:53:57,125
<i>I'm</i> doing a documentary
on language and communication...

1010
00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:00,033
and <i>I'm</i> kind of following the group around.

1011
00:54:00,103 --> 00:54:02,469
- So you're on the road with them?
- Yes.

1012
00:54:04,808 --> 00:54:06,207
<i>Don't</i> worry.

1013
00:54:07,077 --> 00:54:09,637
So, now, where did you first meet Tasty?

1014
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:13,347
Tasty and I met kind of, sort of at a concert.

1015
00:54:13,416 --> 00:54:15,043
But not really. I mean...

1016
00:54:15,118 --> 00:54:17,848
I was hanging out backstage,
and we hooked up.

1017
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:20,754
You meet a lot of men
hanging out backstage?

1018
00:54:20,991 --> 00:54:22,754
<i>It's</i> not like that.

1019
00:54:23,226 --> 00:54:26,457
I mean there are those girls, honey,
who are straight-up skeezers...

1020
00:54:26,529 --> 00:54:30,431
who'll look to jump on a <i>brother's</i> jock
just 'cause <i>he's</i> got a little money...

1021
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:33,435
you know, a little fame. <i>That's</i> not me.

1022
00:54:33,870 --> 00:54:36,805
How many celebrities
have you been out with?

1023
00:54:37,207 --> 00:54:38,902
I <i>don't</i> know, 14?

1024
00:54:45,782 --> 00:54:49,309
- So what you think, Marty?
- <i>I'm</i> in awe.

1025
00:54:49,386 --> 00:54:52,048
- Fantastic.
- Yo, run that again.

1026
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:54,420
No, actually we got to get over to the studio.

1027
00:54:54,524 --> 00:54:56,651
- Where you going?
- Man, I forgot.

1028
00:54:56,726 --> 00:55:00,025
<i>I'm</i> supposed to go
do this audition thing with Jack today.

1029
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:03,622
No, Ice. We're supposed
to be finishing the tracks today.

1030
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:05,463
<i>Don't</i> worry. We'll be right back.

1031
00:55:05,535 --> 00:55:08,698
<i>What's</i> more important,
that stupid audition or N.W. H?

1032
00:55:08,772 --> 00:55:11,866
Look, man. I said <i>I'm</i> gonna be back.
<i>I'm</i> gonna be back.

1033
00:55:11,941 --> 00:55:14,136
All right. <i>I'm</i> outtie.

1034
00:55:14,210 --> 00:55:17,338
<i>I'm</i> gonna be sure to get you guys
auditions, too, you know.

1035
00:55:17,414 --> 00:55:19,609
- So you just outtie, Ice?
- <i>I'm</i> out, man.

1036
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:27,419
Nigga thinks he bigger
than the rest of the group.

1037
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:30,152
Yo, on the serious 3.5- Percent tip...

1038
00:55:30,226 --> 00:55:33,320
the second letter
of the English alphabet is <i>"B."</i>

1039
00:55:33,530 --> 00:55:35,054
Think about it.

1040
00:55:35,899 --> 00:55:37,526
Shut the fuck up!

1041
00:55:39,703 --> 00:55:39,869
They got me out here playing this cop
on this movie deal, you know.

1042
00:55:39,869 --> 00:55:42,997
They got me out here playing this cop
on this movie deal, you know.

1043
00:55:43,073 --> 00:55:46,565
They had to force me to do this
because I <i>ain't</i> with the cops and stuff.

1044
00:55:46,643 --> 00:55:49,111
I personally <i>don't</i> like
most of them motherfuckers.

1045
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:51,079
That <i>ain't</i> me, I got to stretch.

1046
00:55:51,147 --> 00:55:55,208
Look at this, <i>I'm</i> carrying this little revolver.
<i>I'd</i> have an AK.

1047
00:55:56,119 --> 00:55:59,213
And listen to this,
<i>"Yo, motherfucker. Drop it!"</i>

1048
00:55:59,689 --> 00:56:03,090
How am I sound saying shit like that?
I just bust a cap in their ass...

1049
00:56:03,159 --> 00:56:04,683
and shit be over with.

1050
00:56:05,328 --> 00:56:07,888
Check this out. This is Jike Spingleton...

1051
00:56:07,964 --> 00:56:11,764
the director of <i>New Mack Village.</i>
<i>It's</i> a little film we're doing.

1052
00:56:11,835 --> 00:56:14,565
<i>Don't</i> turn the camera off.
I've got something to say.

1053
00:56:14,637 --> 00:56:18,095
I've got something to say
to John, to Spike, and to Matty.

1054
00:56:18,174 --> 00:56:19,436
You stole my shit!

1055
00:56:19,509 --> 00:56:22,342
I had the hat before you did
and the glasses before you did.

1056
00:56:22,412 --> 00:56:24,505
I was short before you were, <i>wasn't</i> I?

1057
00:56:24,581 --> 00:56:26,446
Yeah, they stole all his shit.

1058
00:56:26,516 --> 00:56:30,247
I mean this motherfucker was short,
nearsighted, angry...

1059
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:32,720
long before y'all motherfuckers.

1060
00:56:32,789 --> 00:56:33,687
<i>I'm</i> pissed.

1061
00:56:33,757 --> 00:56:35,554
- I heard.
- Jike, we're ready.

1062
00:56:35,692 --> 00:56:37,284
- They're ready.
- All right, man.

1063
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:39,724
Scene 59, take 3. Marker.

1064
00:56:39,796 --> 00:56:42,629
Now I told you about holding back on me!

1065
00:56:42,699 --> 00:56:45,668
Kicking out freebies to your friends
<i>ain't</i> part of the program.

1066
00:56:45,735 --> 00:56:49,000
This <i>ain't</i> no Mickey D's.
And it <i>ain't</i> no happy hour.

1067
00:56:49,072 --> 00:56:51,199
So the next time you come up short...

1068
00:56:51,274 --> 00:56:53,299
<i>it's</i> your behind. You got it?

1069
00:56:54,611 --> 00:56:56,238
I want my money.

1070
00:56:56,312 --> 00:56:57,404
Rico!

1071
00:56:57,781 --> 00:56:59,476
I knew you was low...

1072
00:56:59,549 --> 00:57:02,279
but making little babies sell your product...

1073
00:57:02,352 --> 00:57:04,616
I <i>didn't</i> even think you would be that low.

1074
00:57:04,687 --> 00:57:06,746
Hey, I <i>ain't</i> got nothing!

1075
00:57:06,823 --> 00:57:08,085
Prove it!

1076
00:57:08,158 --> 00:57:10,752
I got nothing. I told you I got nothing, man.

1077
00:57:19,669 --> 00:57:21,102
Freeze, Rico!

1078
00:57:21,171 --> 00:57:22,604
I'll take them hostage!

1079
00:57:22,672 --> 00:57:24,264
No, you won't!

1080
00:57:28,411 --> 00:57:29,503
Shit!

1081
00:57:34,651 --> 00:57:36,915
Man, I told you! I <i>ain't</i> got no dope!

1082
00:57:38,221 --> 00:57:41,554
What is this? And I'll tell you
another thing, motherfucker:

1083
00:57:41,624 --> 00:57:43,091
<i>Don't</i> call my mama a bitch!

1084
00:57:43,159 --> 00:57:45,821
What, that ho? Oh, God.

1085
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:50,295
<i>I'm</i> taking your ass in...

1086
00:57:50,366 --> 00:57:53,301
with the rest of the creeps
and the motherfuckers...

1087
00:57:53,369 --> 00:57:57,772
in the motherfucking place where
the creeps and the motherfuckers live.

1088
00:57:57,841 --> 00:58:00,241
<i>Don't</i> be doing this shit no more.

1089
00:58:00,577 --> 00:58:01,839
The baby!

1090
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:12,311
Oh, boy, come here, junior.

1091
00:58:13,156 --> 00:58:14,919
You lucky, little man.

1092
00:58:14,991 --> 00:58:17,551
I'll tell you. You got to straighten up.

1093
00:58:17,627 --> 00:58:21,927
You're too young to be wearing beepers
and stuff on your head. Give me that.

1094
00:58:22,699 --> 00:58:25,167
Look, you a little white child, too.

1095
00:58:25,235 --> 00:58:28,261
<i>Don't</i> let 'em tell you this stuff
<i>ain't</i> going out of the 'hood.

1096
00:58:28,338 --> 00:58:31,034
Boy, it <i>ain't</i> too late for you
to straighten up.

1097
00:58:31,441 --> 00:58:34,069
And it <i>ain't</i> too late for you, either.

1098
00:58:34,310 --> 00:58:37,302
Cut! And print! That shit was the bomb!

1099
00:58:38,748 --> 00:58:41,911
<i>I'm</i> the shit! <i>I'm</i> on your ass.
And you know who <i>I'm</i> talking about.

1100
00:58:41,985 --> 00:58:44,078
Am I right?

1101
00:58:46,122 --> 00:58:48,454
Get this shit over here. <i>Let's</i> move on.

1102
00:58:54,430 --> 00:58:56,523
Yo, Tone, <i>where's</i> Ice?

1103
00:58:57,500 --> 00:59:00,469
- He <i>ain't</i> gonna miss no gig.
- He missed the sound check.

1104
00:59:00,537 --> 00:59:03,506
- Yeah, he missed the sound check.
- <i>He's</i> gonna be here.

1105
00:59:03,573 --> 00:59:06,406
He probably ran a little over schedule
on that movie.

1106
00:59:06,476 --> 00:59:08,637
And why is he the only one doing a movie?

1107
00:59:08,711 --> 00:59:10,269
Cheryl! Please.

1108
00:59:10,947 --> 00:59:13,142
All <i>I'm</i> saying is <i>he's</i> getting all the props...

1109
00:59:13,216 --> 00:59:15,116
and you're being pushed
into the background.

1110
00:59:15,184 --> 00:59:17,084
Okay. Way in the "blackground."

1111
00:59:17,153 --> 00:59:19,178
Yo, Tone, Ice was off point.

1112
00:59:19,255 --> 00:59:21,553
Man, I <i>ain't</i> gonna even trip, all right?

1113
00:59:21,624 --> 00:59:22,522
All right.

1114
00:59:22,892 --> 00:59:26,123
But if you ask me, <i>he's</i> treating
both of y'all like bunch of fools.

1115
00:59:26,462 --> 00:59:29,295
I <i>don't</i> know, but you better look out.

1116
00:59:29,666 --> 00:59:31,725
I <i>don't</i> trust that Marty the manager either.

1117
00:59:31,801 --> 00:59:35,396
Well, <i>nobody's</i> asking you.
Look, I <i>ain't</i> gonna let you undermine...

1118
00:59:35,471 --> 00:59:37,837
my spiritual oneness here tonight.
You understand me?

1119
00:59:37,907 --> 00:59:40,569
Tasty, I suggest
you do the same, my brother.

1120
00:59:41,110 --> 00:59:43,704
Tasty'll do what Tasty wants to do.

1121
00:59:44,747 --> 00:59:47,147
Tonight what you wanna do
is talk to Marty and Ice...

1122
00:59:47,216 --> 00:59:50,083
and get this cleared up as
you deserve what Ice is getting...

1123
00:59:50,153 --> 00:59:51,017
plus some.

1124
00:59:51,487 --> 00:59:53,717
Hello, guys. Sorry we're late.

1125
00:59:53,923 --> 00:59:56,391
Have a good show tonight.
Gonna knock 'em dead?

1126
00:59:56,459 --> 00:59:59,223
- Sorry, airport traffic.
- <i>Let's</i> go out there and do it.

1127
00:59:59,295 --> 01:00:00,284
Yo, man!

1128
01:00:00,363 --> 01:00:04,299
I saw the crowd out front.
<i>Tonight's show's</i> gonna be phat and all that.

1129
01:00:04,367 --> 01:00:07,700
You better go get dressed.
Come on, <i>show's</i> gonna begin pretty soon.

1130
01:00:10,807 --> 01:00:12,798
Could you excuse your lady, man?

1131
01:00:12,875 --> 01:00:15,036
He got to get dressed.
Why <i>don't</i> you step out...

1132
01:00:15,111 --> 01:00:18,080
No, <i>don't</i> you have something
you want to say?

1133
01:00:21,684 --> 01:00:23,845
- I was going to talk to him later.
- No, baby, now.

1134
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:25,854
You need to deal with this.

1135
01:00:26,723 --> 01:00:28,657
T is tired of y'all <i>doggin'</i> him.

1136
01:00:28,725 --> 01:00:31,558
- Dogging him?
- And quite frankly, so am I.

1137
01:00:32,128 --> 01:00:33,618
Who the fuck are you?

1138
01:00:33,696 --> 01:00:36,961
Obviously the only person here
who cares about <i>T's</i> welfare.

1139
01:00:37,033 --> 01:00:39,228
How long you been on welfare?

1140
01:00:39,669 --> 01:00:43,400
<i>I'm</i> the one who wants to know
why T <i>isn't</i> doing a film.

1141
01:00:43,673 --> 01:00:46,107
And why T <i>isn't</i> getting any interviews.

1142
01:00:46,175 --> 01:00:49,440
And why T <i>isn't</i> getting
the same hype you're getting.

1143
01:00:49,946 --> 01:00:54,679
Maybe you need to ask T
why <i>he's</i> putting up with your <i>triflin'</i> ass.

1144
01:00:54,751 --> 01:00:56,480
You <i>don't</i> talk to me like that.

1145
01:00:56,886 --> 01:00:58,751
- I just did.
- I know your type.

1146
01:00:58,821 --> 01:01:00,288
I've been watching him, baby.

1147
01:01:00,356 --> 01:01:03,086
<i>She's</i> been telling me stuff about you
to watch out for.

1148
01:01:03,693 --> 01:01:06,093
I <i>don't</i> have to listen to this bitch...

1149
01:01:06,162 --> 01:01:08,357
in the fucking N.W.H. Dressing room.

1150
01:01:08,431 --> 01:01:10,831
<i>Don't</i> be calling her a bitch, man!

1151
01:01:14,804 --> 01:01:16,965
Look, man, <i>let's</i> just do the show.

1152
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:20,498
<i>Let's</i> get out there and perform.
We <i>don't</i> get paid if we <i>don't</i> perform.

1153
01:01:20,576 --> 01:01:22,942
Now, first things first.
Deal with this shit later.

1154
01:01:29,485 --> 01:01:31,146
Just step off.

1155
01:01:31,220 --> 01:01:34,018
- <i>Don't</i> put your hands on me!
- Man, you got a problem, man?

1156
01:01:42,765 --> 01:01:44,289
Come on, get up!

1157
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:51,541
We need to talk about
what happened out there tonight.

1158
01:01:51,541 --> 01:01:53,099
We need to talk about
what happened out there tonight.

1159
01:01:53,176 --> 01:01:56,270
No, I think we need to talk
about what <i>didn't</i> happen out there.

1160
01:01:56,345 --> 01:01:58,939
And what <i>didn't</i> happen
was that we <i>didn't</i> get paid.

1161
01:01:59,148 --> 01:02:02,140
If we do another gig and
I <i>don't</i> get my <i>motherfuckin'</i> money...

1162
01:02:02,351 --> 01:02:05,320
I will kick the <i>nigga's</i> motherfucking
ass if I have to!

1163
01:02:05,388 --> 01:02:07,185
No need to get loud. We can work this out.

1164
01:02:07,256 --> 01:02:10,191
How'll we work it out if he treats you
like a second-class citizen?

1165
01:02:10,259 --> 01:02:11,248
<i>I'm</i> getting punked.

1166
01:02:11,327 --> 01:02:13,454
Y'all <i>doggin'</i> T. That <i>ain't</i> right.

1167
01:02:13,529 --> 01:02:15,929
<i>Let's</i> just calm down and work this out.

1168
01:02:15,998 --> 01:02:18,432
This is supposed to be us: N.W. H!

1169
01:02:18,501 --> 01:02:22,267
I <i>ain't</i> got my bitch in the motherfucker.
Tone, if he had a bitch...

1170
01:02:22,338 --> 01:02:24,306
she <i>wouldn't</i> be in this motherfucker.

1171
01:02:24,373 --> 01:02:28,241
What the fuck is she doing here, man?
She <i>ain't</i> supposed to be here, man!

1172
01:02:28,311 --> 01:02:31,178
She <i>ain't</i> supposed to be here,
that bitch should be outtie.

1173
01:02:31,247 --> 01:02:34,080
- I <i>ain't</i> going nowhere.
- She <i>ain't</i> going nowhere.

1174
01:02:36,385 --> 01:02:39,946
So <i>that's</i> how <i>it's</i> gonna be.
You gonna side with her.

1175
01:02:40,223 --> 01:02:43,954
<i>That's</i> all right. I <i>don't</i> know
what kind of ill shit this is, motherfucker...

1176
01:02:44,026 --> 01:02:45,550
but all right!

1177
01:02:46,162 --> 01:02:49,757
- He <i>can't</i> tell you and me what to do.
- You <i>can't</i> tell me and her what to do.

1178
01:02:50,166 --> 01:02:52,930
Motherfucker, somebody needs
to tell you something, man!

1179
01:02:53,002 --> 01:02:54,367
Because she ganking you!

1180
01:02:54,437 --> 01:02:57,167
<i>She's</i> licking your ass
like a fucking lollipop...

1181
01:02:57,240 --> 01:02:59,834
- in this motherfucker.
- So what're you saying?

1182
01:02:59,909 --> 01:03:03,970
What <i>I'm</i> saying? Motherfucker!
What the fuck am I saying?

1183
01:03:04,046 --> 01:03:05,513
<i>Motherfucker...</i>

1184
01:03:06,048 --> 01:03:08,209
Shit, <i>where's</i> your wallet, man?

1185
01:03:08,551 --> 01:03:11,076
Where is your motherfucking wallet?

1186
01:03:11,988 --> 01:03:13,250
I got it.

1187
01:03:13,356 --> 01:03:14,448
Damn!

1188
01:03:14,991 --> 01:03:18,188
She just holds onto my wallet
while I perform. So what?

1189
01:03:18,661 --> 01:03:19,992
So what? Motherfucker.

1190
01:03:20,062 --> 01:03:23,361
Count your fucking ends the next time
you get that motherfucker back.

1191
01:03:23,432 --> 01:03:25,161
If you get it back.

1192
01:03:25,268 --> 01:03:27,065
He better stop disrespecting me.

1193
01:03:27,136 --> 01:03:29,366
You better stop <i>dissin'</i> Cheryl.

1194
01:03:29,639 --> 01:03:33,336
Motherfucker, you gonna make me
stop disrespecting that bitch?

1195
01:03:33,409 --> 01:03:35,274
Hell, yeah, <i>I'm</i> gonna make you, nigga.

1196
01:03:35,344 --> 01:03:37,642
- <i>Let's</i> go, motherfucker!
- Come on, Dr. Seuss.

1197
01:03:37,713 --> 01:03:39,476
<i>Let's</i> go. Come on.

1198
01:03:40,216 --> 01:03:42,241
Calm down before somebody gets hurt.

1199
01:03:42,318 --> 01:03:44,309
Word, man. <i>Marty's</i> right.

1200
01:03:44,453 --> 01:03:48,617
If y'all going to go at this,
you've got to come clean. Drop your shit.

1201
01:03:48,858 --> 01:03:50,189
All right.

1202
01:03:51,460 --> 01:03:52,518
There it is.

1203
01:03:52,595 --> 01:03:56,429
Motherfucker, see? Take the clip out
and everything, on your ass.

1204
01:03:56,499 --> 01:03:59,127
Yeah, all right. Here you go.

1205
01:04:00,469 --> 01:04:03,165
<i>I'm</i> dropping everything.

1206
01:04:07,210 --> 01:04:08,575
Wait a minute.

1207
01:04:08,845 --> 01:04:13,305
I want to be totally raw with you, nigga.
<i>'Cause I ain't</i> afraid of you.

1208
01:04:13,649 --> 01:04:14,479
Uzi.

1209
01:04:15,985 --> 01:04:17,077
HK.

1210
01:04:18,754 --> 01:04:19,812
Switch.

1211
01:04:20,656 --> 01:04:22,283
<i>Let's</i> go, nigga.

1212
01:04:23,326 --> 01:04:25,760
- Come on, nigga.
- Brothers.

1213
01:04:26,062 --> 01:04:27,893
You gotta remove the hats.

1214
01:04:28,965 --> 01:04:30,762
You right about that.

1215
01:04:33,669 --> 01:04:36,365
Hold that. I am taking this shit off.

1216
01:04:36,439 --> 01:04:38,430
I am taking my shit off, too.

1217
01:04:38,507 --> 01:04:40,099
Come on. <i>I'm</i> with that.

1218
01:04:40,176 --> 01:04:42,667
I <i>can't</i> have you pull a knife
and fuck up my good jacket.

1219
01:04:42,745 --> 01:04:44,975
<i>I'm</i> gonna whip you butt-naked. Come on.

1220
01:04:45,047 --> 01:04:47,140
- Fuck up my gear and shit.
- <i>Let's</i> go.

1221
01:04:48,217 --> 01:04:50,651
All right, come on. <i>Let's</i> go! I <i>ain't havin'</i> it.

1222
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:53,052
You niggas going to fight or fuck?

1223
01:04:54,690 --> 01:04:56,487
Stop! <i>That's</i> enough!

1224
01:04:56,726 --> 01:04:58,489
<i>Let's</i> go to sleep.

1225
01:04:59,295 --> 01:05:01,991
We'll talk about this in the morning.

1226
01:05:02,398 --> 01:05:04,298
That might be the move.

1227
01:05:06,235 --> 01:05:08,032
I can work with that.

1228
01:05:08,271 --> 01:05:11,240
You are not afraid to work with a group...

1229
01:05:11,307 --> 01:05:13,639
whose last five managers were killed?

1230
01:05:15,811 --> 01:05:18,302
A lot is made of that,
but <i>it's</i> really no big deal.

1231
01:05:18,381 --> 01:05:21,043
Those happen to have been
very tragic accidents...

1232
01:05:21,117 --> 01:05:23,017
but nothing deliberate.

1233
01:05:23,286 --> 01:05:25,220
- No fear at all?
- No.

1234
01:05:26,822 --> 01:05:28,312
You mean this?

1235
01:05:29,725 --> 01:05:31,625
I keep this <i>because...</i>

1236
01:05:31,827 --> 01:05:34,796
You know, <i>it's</i> something the guys have.
They're into guns.

1237
01:05:34,864 --> 01:05:39,267
So, I thought I would get one
because <i>it's</i> something we can talk about.

1238
01:05:39,568 --> 01:05:43,402
It is like a male bonding kind of thing.
You know what I mean?

1239
01:05:43,639 --> 01:05:46,437
I <i>don't</i> keep it loaded. See, <i>it's</i> empty.

1240
01:05:46,509 --> 01:05:50,673
I keep the bullets hidden.
I certainly <i>don't</i> plan on ever using it.

1241
01:05:52,515 --> 01:05:56,076
You <i>don't</i> need to apologize,
but we need to talk this out, all right?

1242
01:05:56,152 --> 01:05:58,120
I mean, <i>he's</i> as upset about this as you are.

1243
01:05:58,187 --> 01:06:01,281
But if he even begins to act ill,
<i>I'm</i> through with his ass.

1244
01:06:01,357 --> 01:06:05,259
<i>Let's</i> just calm things down
and sort things out.

1245
01:06:10,032 --> 01:06:11,056
<i>'Morning.

1246
01:06:12,902 --> 01:06:14,130
Wake up, man.

1247
01:06:14,971 --> 01:06:16,438
Good morning.

1248
01:06:19,308 --> 01:06:21,936
Got the sunshine coming in and everything.
<i>What's</i> up?

1249
01:06:22,011 --> 01:06:23,569
Wake up. We gotta talk.

1250
01:06:23,646 --> 01:06:26,012
Get up. We've got to talk. This is important.

1251
01:06:26,082 --> 01:06:28,778
What is it man? <i>Let's</i> talk. <i>Let's...</i>

1252
01:06:31,387 --> 01:06:33,082
Wake up, man, we gotta talk.

1253
01:06:33,155 --> 01:06:36,283
<i>Let's</i> talk later.
I got somebody here right now.

1254
01:06:36,359 --> 01:06:38,725
We should just talk a little later.

1255
01:06:38,794 --> 01:06:40,921
Marty, <i>don't</i> worry about it.

1256
01:06:40,997 --> 01:06:44,228
I've seen him with a powpow before.
It <i>ain't</i> no big deal.

1257
01:06:47,069 --> 01:06:48,161
Shit.

1258
01:06:53,275 --> 01:06:56,142
<i>That's</i> it. <i>Everybody's</i> gonna die.

1259
01:06:56,212 --> 01:06:58,146
- Listen.
- Bullshit.

1260
01:06:58,514 --> 01:07:01,847
- How could you do this, Ice?
- I told you, baby is a freak.

1261
01:07:01,984 --> 01:07:03,952
Put them down! I'll kill your ass!

1262
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:06,079
We'll just be two dead motherfuckers...

1263
01:07:06,155 --> 01:07:08,817
- 'cause I <i>ain't</i> dying alone.
- <i>That's</i> enough.

1264
01:07:08,891 --> 01:07:11,792
Put them down before somebody gets hurt.

1265
01:07:13,696 --> 01:07:15,357
I need my bullets.

1266
01:07:15,431 --> 01:07:16,989
<i>What's</i> wrong with you, Cheryl?

1267
01:07:17,066 --> 01:07:19,591
<i>Ain't nothin'</i> wrong with me a man <i>can't</i> fix.

1268
01:07:19,668 --> 01:07:22,728
- You're saying I <i>ain't</i> a man?
- <i>I'm</i> saying...

1269
01:07:23,072 --> 01:07:25,700
I needed what I needed when I needed it.

1270
01:07:25,775 --> 01:07:27,367
<i>What'd</i> you buy her, Ice?

1271
01:07:27,576 --> 01:07:30,010
Nothing, man. That bitch is a ho.

1272
01:07:30,112 --> 01:07:32,910
- Ho?
- You heard him, you're a ho!

1273
01:07:33,049 --> 01:07:37,509
<i>Ain't</i> gonna be too many more hos
in this motherfucker. Fuck this.

1274
01:07:41,290 --> 01:07:42,882
<i>What's</i> up, money?

1275
01:07:44,660 --> 01:07:45,752
Come on!

1276
01:07:45,828 --> 01:07:47,796
Now you got this motherfucker involved.

1277
01:07:47,863 --> 01:07:50,297
Everybody here is gonna die!

1278
01:07:50,366 --> 01:07:52,561
Stop it before somebody gets killed!

1279
01:08:02,511 --> 01:08:03,603
Damn!

1280
01:08:04,914 --> 01:08:07,405
It was your fault.
You <i>shouldn't</i> have done that!

1281
01:08:07,483 --> 01:08:10,043
You <i>shouldn't</i> have been bringing
that babe on the tour.

1282
01:08:10,119 --> 01:08:12,644
- I told you not to...
- I'll shoot your dick off!

1283
01:08:27,436 --> 01:08:29,870
<i>This incident proved to be the final straw.</i>

1284
01:08:29,939 --> 01:08:31,839
<i>N. W.H. Was history.</i>

1285
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:42,010
This album is your first artistic venture
since leaving N.W.H.

1286
01:08:42,284 --> 01:08:46,277
You know, I thought it was time
for me to step off...

1287
01:08:46,355 --> 01:08:50,086
and kick that N.W.H. Thing to the curb
for a minute and find my own flavor.

1288
01:08:50,159 --> 01:08:53,128
You say that this album
is politically oriented.

1289
01:08:53,195 --> 01:08:57,029
But this song is called
<i>Come Pet The P.U.S.S. Y.</i>

1290
01:08:57,433 --> 01:08:59,060
<i>Come Pet The P.U.S.S. Y.</i> Yeah.

1291
01:08:59,135 --> 01:09:03,538
But I do say P-U-S-S-Y
in the song because I set it up like that.

1292
01:09:03,973 --> 01:09:06,840
- Like the letters, like an "analagram."
- Anagram?

1293
01:09:06,909 --> 01:09:08,877
An anagram, you know what I am saying?

1294
01:09:08,944 --> 01:09:11,310
So it is like P is political...

1295
01:09:11,380 --> 01:09:14,076
U-unrest, S-stabilizes...

1296
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:16,584
another S-society, Y-year.

1297
01:09:16,852 --> 01:09:18,285
- No.
- Yeah.

1298
01:09:18,687 --> 01:09:21,588
What we are saying is,
if we want to change this madness...

1299
01:09:21,657 --> 01:09:24,421
<i>that's</i> going on in our community
and in our world...

1300
01:09:24,493 --> 01:09:27,826
then we got to step to the pussy.
Step to this ideology.

1301
01:09:27,897 --> 01:09:29,922
We got to embrace the pussy.

1302
01:09:29,999 --> 01:09:33,935
You understand? Embracing <i>the...</i>
Have you ever had your pussy embraced?

1303
01:09:34,670 --> 01:09:37,138
I mean, has someone came up and just...

1304
01:09:37,206 --> 01:09:39,333
embraced that motherfucker?

1305
01:09:43,245 --> 01:09:45,577
<i>P- U-S-S-Y</i>

1306
01:09:47,316 --> 01:09:49,341
<i>P- U-S-S-Y</i>

1307
01:09:51,453 --> 01:09:53,512
<i>P- U-S-S-Y</i>

1308
01:09:55,558 --> 01:09:57,822
<i>P- U-S-S-Y</i>

1309
01:09:59,695 --> 01:10:03,791
<i>Come and pet the pussy</i>
<i>Hey, hey, hey</i>

1310
01:10:03,999 --> 01:10:05,830
<i>Hey, hey, hey!</i>

1311
01:10:07,836 --> 01:10:13,536
<i>Come and pet the pussy!</i>
<i>Hey, hey, hey</i>

1312
01:10:16,045 --> 01:10:19,947
<i>Political unrest stabilizes society yes</i>
<i>and I must confess</i>

1313
01:10:20,015 --> 01:10:24,076
<i>When you step to it, step to it hard</i>
<i>it'll open up so don't bogart</i>

1314
01:10:24,353 --> 01:10:28,380
<i>The P the U the S and another S Y
<i>pet it and you will decide</i>

1315
01:10:28,457 --> 01:10:32,223
<i>The fate of this entire nation</i>
<i>when it comes you'll get total elation</i>

1316
01:10:32,294 --> 01:10:35,991
<i>Step to the L-l-P-S</i>
<i>pucker up and press</i>

1317
01:10:36,065 --> 01:10:38,659
<i>Your lips to the lips of the funk</i>
<i>between the hips</i>

1318
01:10:38,734 --> 01:10:40,702
<i>Nah, this ain't no dis</i>

1319
01:10:40,769 --> 01:10:44,830
<i>Time to stand erect and gain entry</i>
<i>to the richness that waits within, see</i>

1320
01:10:44,907 --> 01:10:48,934
<i>We gotta work hard if we wanna groove it</i>
<i>and I'm in it to win it so let's do it</i>

1321
01:10:49,011 --> 01:10:53,038
<i>Come and pet the pussy</i>
<i>Hey, hey, hey</i>

1322
01:10:53,115 --> 01:10:57,142
<i>Hey, hey, hey</i>
<i>Hey, hey, hey</i>

1323
01:10:57,253 --> 01:10:59,221
<i>Come and pet the pussy</i>

1324
01:10:59,288 --> 01:11:03,315
<i>Hey, hey, hey</i>
<i>Hey, hey, hey</i>

1325
01:11:03,392 --> 01:11:05,383
<i>Hey, hey, hey</i>

1326
01:11:06,061 --> 01:11:07,961
So now, your new group.

1327
01:11:08,230 --> 01:11:10,630
- The New Human Formantics.
- Yes.

1328
01:11:10,899 --> 01:11:12,059
What does that mean?

1329
01:11:12,468 --> 01:11:15,062
Well, it is a new way of looking
at the human form.

1330
01:11:15,137 --> 01:11:18,129
See, you might not notice, but <i>I'm</i> not black.

1331
01:11:18,641 --> 01:11:19,699
You're not?

1332
01:11:19,775 --> 01:11:23,677
It took me a long time to realize that,
but <i>I'm</i> not black...

1333
01:11:24,780 --> 01:11:27,977
or colored, or Negro, or African-American...

1334
01:11:28,050 --> 01:11:32,885
or morani, or high yellow, or Creole.
None of the labels society places on us.

1335
01:11:32,955 --> 01:11:35,981
You see, I <i>don't</i> see color anymore.

1336
01:11:36,325 --> 01:11:39,021
You know, I look at people, and everybody...

1337
01:11:39,161 --> 01:11:41,254
seems to be the same shade.

1338
01:11:41,330 --> 01:11:45,164
- You sure <i>it's</i> not the glasses?
- <i>I'm</i> just a human being.

1339
01:11:55,044 --> 01:11:57,444
<i>- You are just like me</i>
<i>- I'm just a human</i>

1340
01:11:57,546 --> 01:11:59,639
<i>- I am just like you</i>
<i>- I'm just a human</i>

1341
01:11:59,715 --> 01:12:02,377
<i>- We all stand or sit when we pee</i>
<i>- I'm just a human</i>

1342
01:12:02,451 --> 01:12:04,817
<i>I'm just a human being</i>

1343
01:12:04,887 --> 01:12:07,287
<i>- You are just like me</i>
<i>- I'm just a human</i>

1344
01:12:07,389 --> 01:12:09,414
<i>- I am just like you</i>
<i>- I'm just a human</i>

1345
01:12:09,491 --> 01:12:13,928
<i>- We all stand or sit when we pee</i>
<i>- I'm just a human, just a human being</i>

1346
01:12:14,296 --> 01:12:16,787
<i>When I doo-doo, is my shit not brown?</i>

1347
01:12:16,865 --> 01:12:19,231
<i>It's a universal thing, we all flush it down</i>

1348
01:12:19,301 --> 01:12:21,929
<i>When you wipe, do you look at the tissue?</i>

1349
01:12:22,004 --> 01:12:24,472
<i>Most folks do, it ain't even an issue</i>

1350
01:12:24,540 --> 01:12:26,531
<i>Hot stuff makes it burn coming out</i>

1351
01:12:26,608 --> 01:12:29,008
<i>I bet everyone knows</i>
<i>what I am talking about</i>

1352
01:12:29,078 --> 01:12:31,376
<i>because we are all one race on this planet</i>

1353
01:12:31,447 --> 01:12:34,211
<i>We all burp and fart</i>
<i>and that's the way God planned it</i>

1354
01:12:34,283 --> 01:12:36,945
<i>So don't act like you're superior</i>
<i>Eat something bad</i>

1355
01:12:37,019 --> 01:12:39,010
<i>and just like me, you'll get diarrhea</i>

1356
01:12:39,088 --> 01:12:41,522
<i>'Cause black, white, yellow</i>
<i>red, brown, or gold</i>

1357
01:12:41,590 --> 01:12:44,081
<i>our shit all comes from the same little hole</i>

1358
01:12:44,159 --> 01:12:46,559
<i>- You are just like me</i>
<i>- I'm just a human</i>

1359
01:12:46,628 --> 01:12:48,687
<i>- I am just like you</i>
<i>- I'm just a human</i>

1360
01:12:48,764 --> 01:12:53,531
<i>- We all stand or sit when we pee</i>
<i>- I am just a human, just a human being</i>

1361
01:12:54,002 --> 01:12:56,368
<i>- You are just like me</i>
<i>- I'm just a human</i>

1362
01:12:56,438 --> 01:12:58,406
<i>- I am just like you</i>
<i>- I'm just a human</i>

1363
01:12:58,474 --> 01:13:02,843
<i>- We all stand or sit when we pee</i>
<i>- I'm just a human, just a human being</i>

1364
01:13:04,413 --> 01:13:06,210
You're looking well.

1365
01:13:07,082 --> 01:13:09,312
- You've seen my new album?
- No.

1366
01:13:10,018 --> 01:13:13,510
Brand new from the Tasty,
a.k.a. Tasty-Taste.

1367
01:13:13,589 --> 01:13:16,820
<i>Extreme Use Of Force.</i>
Now, see, that is <i>Ice's</i> ass, right?

1368
01:13:16,892 --> 01:13:20,419
And <i>that's</i> me with the jackhammer.
So you know <i>what's</i> going on.

1369
01:13:20,829 --> 01:13:22,296
You hate Ice.

1370
01:13:22,564 --> 01:13:26,728
That high yellow, gold-teeth-wearing
cock blocker, <i>skeezer-grabbin'...</i>

1371
01:13:26,802 --> 01:13:29,737
block-headed punk motherfucker.
I hate him!

1372
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:35,037
Like I was saying. I do things
on my album that he would never do.

1373
01:13:35,110 --> 01:13:38,273
You mean, songs like <i>The Ice Man Melteth...</i>

1374
01:13:38,947 --> 01:13:41,507
<i>Icy Eat Me, Fuck Ice?</i>

1375
01:13:42,050 --> 01:13:44,848
But the cut you did not mention
<i>that's</i> dope, sister...

1376
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:47,787
is the cut called
<i>I Am Going to Kick Your Boot T.</i>

1377
01:13:47,923 --> 01:13:50,323
Where I put my foot up some ice.

1378
01:13:50,426 --> 01:13:50,626
<i>Left, right, left, you're toothless</i>

1379
01:13:50,626 --> 01:13:52,355
<i>Left, right, left, you're toothless</i>

1380
01:13:52,428 --> 01:13:55,989
<i>- Right, left, right, left, you're toothless</i>
<i>- Hit me monkey, hit me</i>

1381
01:13:56,064 --> 01:13:57,895
<i>Yeah, suckers, it's me</i>

1382
01:13:57,966 --> 01:14:00,730
<i>The diddily, diddily T servin' up dynamite</i>

1383
01:14:00,803 --> 01:14:03,636
<i>and strikin' like a cobra</i>
<i>at the foot of your bed</i>

1384
01:14:03,705 --> 01:14:05,935
<i>It is over when I leave you for dead</i>

1385
01:14:06,008 --> 01:14:08,272
<i>Ice melts when the T gets hot</i>

1386
01:14:08,343 --> 01:14:10,641
<i>Ice cracks when the T does rock</i>

1387
01:14:10,712 --> 01:14:12,680
<i>Gonna hit you so hard you scream</i>

1388
01:14:12,748 --> 01:14:15,216
<i>How could a little nigga be so mean</i>

1389
01:14:15,317 --> 01:14:17,649
<i>I'm ready to blast like a megaton</i>

1390
01:14:17,719 --> 01:14:18,845
<i>I'm strong</i>

1391
01:14:18,921 --> 01:14:21,412
<i>I last for millenniums</i>
<i>You are going to feel the stress</i>

1392
01:14:21,490 --> 01:14:24,755
<i>when you mess with the best</i>
<i>The one and only Tasty</i>

1393
01:14:24,827 --> 01:14:26,920
<i>Yeah, power-packed, like TNT</i>

1394
01:14:26,995 --> 01:14:29,122
<i>When I rickity, rickity, rock you get no relief</i>

1395
01:14:29,198 --> 01:14:31,564
<i>From the barrage of rhymes I'm droppin'</i>

1396
01:14:31,633 --> 01:14:34,193
<i>on your head and the ammo ain't stoppin'</i>

1397
01:14:34,269 --> 01:14:37,432
<i>Packed, stacked, tracks that ain't ever wack</i>
<i>and I ain't jacked</i>

1398
01:14:37,506 --> 01:14:40,600
<i>sucka step to the back</i>
<i>It's not a game when the T attacks you</i>

1399
01:14:40,676 --> 01:14:42,940
<i>you so weak I could just bitch-slap you</i>

1400
01:14:43,011 --> 01:14:45,878
<i>I am going to kick your black ass</i>

1401
01:14:45,948 --> 01:14:50,510
<i>Granny says kick your black ass</i>
<i>I am going to kick your black ass</i>

1402
01:14:50,619 --> 01:14:52,644
<i>Granny says kick your black ass</i>

1403
01:14:52,821 --> 01:14:56,222
Tasty-Taste may be looking to do more
than kick just Ice <i>Cold's</i> booty.

1404
01:14:56,291 --> 01:15:00,318
His latest manager has ripped Tasty off
for more than a few thousand dollars.

1405
01:15:00,395 --> 01:15:03,262
In another N.W.H. News,
Ice Cold now finds himself embroiled...

1406
01:15:03,332 --> 01:15:05,527
in a lawsuit filed by Mabel Ann Jackson...

1407
01:15:05,601 --> 01:15:08,195
who claims <i>she's</i> received neither
credit nor compensation...

1408
01:15:08,270 --> 01:15:11,637
for singing the female lead vocal track
on the Ice Plant single...

1409
01:15:11,707 --> 01:15:13,174
<i>Come Pet The P.U.S.S. Y.</i>

1410
01:15:13,242 --> 01:15:16,609
With us in the studio is Tiffini,
who refutes Mabel <i>Ann's</i> claim.

1411
01:15:16,678 --> 01:15:20,239
She says it was her voice
that sang the vocal track on that song.

1412
01:15:21,216 --> 01:15:25,209
<i>I'd</i> like you to listen to something.
Tell me if <i>it's</i> really your voice.

1413
01:15:33,829 --> 01:15:36,024
You're saying <i>that's</i> definitely you?

1414
01:15:36,632 --> 01:15:39,965
<i>That's</i> my <i>voice.</i> "Come and pet the <i>pussy."</i>

1415
01:15:40,168 --> 01:15:42,329
People are having trouble imagining how...

1416
01:15:42,404 --> 01:15:46,397
someone with an accent as pronounced
as yours can sound so black.

1417
01:15:46,575 --> 01:15:48,236
I speak Japanese.

1418
01:15:48,577 --> 01:15:50,477
But I sing black...

1419
01:15:50,546 --> 01:15:52,537
like Paula Abdul.

1420
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:54,409
No, you didn't!

1421
01:15:55,517 --> 01:15:59,283
You know damn well you <i>didn't</i> sing
<i>Come Pet The P.U.S.S. Y.</i>

1422
01:15:59,421 --> 01:16:00,854
I sang that song.

1423
01:16:01,089 --> 01:16:04,024
- No, I sing song.
- Bitch, please!

1424
01:16:12,935 --> 01:16:17,201
In further N.W.H. News, Tone-Def,
former spiritual member of N.W. H...

1425
01:16:17,272 --> 01:16:19,763
currently on his own
with New Human Formantics...

1426
01:16:19,841 --> 01:16:22,366
has run into some trouble in New York City.

1427
01:16:23,845 --> 01:16:27,576
Some cabbies there <i>aren't</i> buying
<i>Tone's</i> assertion that <i>he's</i> not black.

1428
01:16:27,649 --> 01:16:29,810
First, he was turned down
by a cabby on Broadway.

1429
01:16:29,885 --> 01:16:34,151
Then when he attacked a car, screaming,
<i>"I am not black, I am only human"...</i>

1430
01:16:34,222 --> 01:16:36,588
the cabby jumped out and
with some nearby colleagues...

1431
01:16:36,658 --> 01:16:38,990
proceeded to beat Tone until police arrived.

1432
01:16:39,061 --> 01:16:42,292
In New York City, apparently,
being human <i>isn't</i> enough.

1433
01:16:42,464 --> 01:16:46,161
<i>I'm Kurt Loder, still white</i>
<i>and reportedly human in New York City.</i>

1434
01:16:49,304 --> 01:16:52,899
<i>That's</i> some bullshit, because my album
sold way more than that.

1435
01:16:53,842 --> 01:16:57,175
Your album was like dookie on the street,
it just sat there and stank.

1436
01:16:57,245 --> 01:16:59,679
I thought you came to cheer me up.

1437
01:17:00,849 --> 01:17:02,407
Sorry, man.

1438
01:17:02,684 --> 01:17:06,211
I know we <i>shouldn't</i> be acting like this
with you all laid out.

1439
01:17:06,288 --> 01:17:08,756
Look at this shit. All hooked up.

1440
01:17:10,592 --> 01:17:13,755
You got his nuts swinging out
when you did that.

1441
01:17:16,365 --> 01:17:17,627
Fuck you.

1442
01:17:19,334 --> 01:17:21,529
Why <i>don't</i> y'all put this shit in check...

1443
01:17:21,603 --> 01:17:25,130
before I have to get out of this bed
and fuck both y'all up.

1444
01:17:25,240 --> 01:17:26,468
You're right.

1445
01:17:27,776 --> 01:17:29,300
You was wrong, Ice.

1446
01:17:31,446 --> 01:17:32,811
<i>I'm</i> sorry.

1447
01:17:35,183 --> 01:17:39,313
I want both of y'all to know that,
even though N.W.H. <i>Ain't</i> nothing...

1448
01:17:39,388 --> 01:17:41,583
if y'all ever need me, <i>I'm</i> there.

1449
01:17:41,823 --> 01:17:45,782
I got your back, you know, whatever.
We got too much history and whatnot.

1450
01:17:45,894 --> 01:17:47,828
<i>I'm</i> glad you niggas said that, because...

1451
01:17:47,896 --> 01:17:52,560
I need one of you all to grab that bedpan
and stick it up underneath my ass.

1452
01:17:54,469 --> 01:17:56,300
It <i>ain't</i> that kind of party.

1453
01:18:03,912 --> 01:18:06,107
I am giving you more time
than you need already.

1454
01:18:06,181 --> 01:18:09,241
Go out and do the new one,
<i>Put Your Mouth Where Your Manhole Is.</i>

1455
01:18:09,317 --> 01:18:12,150
- <i>Put Your Mouth Where...</i>
- <i>That's</i> the cut, all right.

1456
01:18:12,220 --> 01:18:16,054
<i>That's</i> the new one, they <i>haven't</i> heard that.
You go out there and bust that one.

1457
01:18:16,124 --> 01:18:20,083
How many times you think they want to hear
you do <i>Come Pet The P.U.S.S. Y.?</i>

1458
01:18:20,162 --> 01:18:25,259
Look, I'll do <i>Put Your Manhole Where</i>
<i>My Mouth Is</i> and then I'll...

1459
01:18:26,935 --> 01:18:29,836
Are you begging for more stage time?

1460
01:18:31,339 --> 01:18:33,398
You need to quit, sucker.

1461
01:18:35,811 --> 01:18:38,507
You lie down with dogs...

1462
01:18:38,714 --> 01:18:41,376
and then you wake up
with disease, motherfuckers.

1463
01:18:41,450 --> 01:18:42,917
You seen Ice?

1464
01:18:42,984 --> 01:18:45,612
<i>He's</i> trying to get more time.
They only gave me seven.

1465
01:18:45,721 --> 01:18:49,157
Seven? They gave me four to do
<i>I'm Only Human.</i>

1466
01:18:49,324 --> 01:18:52,589
I <i>don't</i> wanna do that shit.
I'll tell you what, I was wrong on that.

1467
01:18:52,761 --> 01:18:57,198
But on my next joint, I <i>ain't talkin'</i>
about <i>nothin'</i> except for doing something...

1468
01:18:57,299 --> 01:18:59,426
about these punk-ass cab drivers.

1469
01:19:00,469 --> 01:19:02,232
Yo, Ice, did you get more time?

1470
01:19:02,304 --> 01:19:05,273
No, man. <i>I'm</i> getting tired
of this two-song-per-show bullshit.

1471
01:19:06,808 --> 01:19:08,935
It <i>ain't</i> like it was when we was N.W.H.

1472
01:19:09,044 --> 01:19:12,912
What up, Tone, Taste, Ice. I heard y'all
talking to Lucky about the time thing.

1473
01:19:13,515 --> 01:19:15,244
Yeah, man. You got out of the joint?

1474
01:19:15,517 --> 01:19:16,814
Been out three months now.

1475
01:19:17,018 --> 01:19:19,213
Just in time for your boys to drop
their new beats.

1476
01:19:19,354 --> 01:19:21,549
No, they dropped me when I went to jail...

1477
01:19:21,723 --> 01:19:24,920
but such is life, I got a new group,
Peaches and Cream.

1478
01:19:24,993 --> 01:19:28,019
We got the new cut, <i>Yo, Yo, Yogurt,</i>
<i>it's</i> gonna be real smooth.

1479
01:19:28,196 --> 01:19:29,959
Since I <i>don't</i> have The Jam Boys anymore...

1480
01:19:30,031 --> 01:19:32,727
<i>I'm</i> looking for a new crew.
Thought y'all might be interested.

1481
01:19:34,836 --> 01:19:36,701
I got my cousin doing my shit, now.

1482
01:19:36,772 --> 01:19:39,570
Yeah, you know, I've been looking
for somebody, but...

1483
01:19:39,641 --> 01:19:41,939
Yeah, <i>I'm</i> kinda <i>doin'</i> my shit on my own.

1484
01:19:42,110 --> 01:19:46,979
No, not as individuals. <i>I'm</i> talking about
putting N.W.H. Back together again.

1485
01:19:47,249 --> 01:19:50,980
<i>Bustin'</i> mad funky beats so phat
that y'all <i>can't</i> help but blow up.

1486
01:19:52,687 --> 01:19:56,054
I <i>don't</i> know, man.
I mean, we in different creative spaces.

1487
01:19:56,224 --> 01:19:59,284
<i>I'm</i> not sure I <i>ain't</i> still mad enough
to try and kill him.

1488
01:20:00,195 --> 01:20:03,631
Besides, you the same nigga that shot one
of our managers.

1489
01:20:03,698 --> 01:20:05,165
How is that ill shit gonna look?

1490
01:20:05,233 --> 01:20:07,667
Yeah, I mean that is something
to think about.

1491
01:20:07,736 --> 01:20:09,169
Think about this.

1492
01:20:09,237 --> 01:20:10,829
I talked to Be Real Records today.

1493
01:20:10,939 --> 01:20:16,343
They <i>talkin'</i> about giving you $400,000
to go back in the studio and perform.

1494
01:20:16,478 --> 01:20:19,504
<i>That's</i> deep, deep
Jacques Cousteau pockets.

1495
01:20:19,581 --> 01:20:21,742
And on top of that, nine points.

1496
01:20:21,817 --> 01:20:24,012
We're <i>talkin'</i> about wrinkly,
white-people money.

1497
01:20:24,152 --> 01:20:27,121
So, dj vu. <i>It's</i> back on you.

1498
01:20:27,756 --> 01:20:32,750
Well, artistically I could make a move
backward to make that step forward.

1499
01:20:33,495 --> 01:20:35,554
The mad is leaving me.

1500
01:20:36,264 --> 01:20:38,562
Tell you what, my brothers. Spiritually...

1501
01:20:40,135 --> 01:20:43,263
- it feels good as a motherfucker.
- All right. <i>Let's</i> play.

1502
01:20:43,705 --> 01:20:48,074
- Yo, man, why you gotta come up on stage?
- We the damn headliners!

1503
01:20:48,443 --> 01:20:51,537
Say, man, look. We got some special
surprise guests coming on.

1504
01:20:51,613 --> 01:20:55,515
<i>We've got something special tonight.</i>
<i>You all remember N. W.H.</i>

1505
01:20:55,584 --> 01:21:00,146
<i>Well, tonight, for the first time in a year:</i>
<i>N. W.H.</i>

1506
01:21:05,060 --> 01:21:09,656
- We back in the house!
- In this house, going back to the top.

1507
01:21:11,933 --> 01:21:13,924
I got a bottle of syrup that looks like you.

1508
01:21:14,002 --> 01:21:14,035
N.W. H!

1509
01:21:14,035 --> 01:21:18,768
N.W. H!

1510
01:21:28,383 --> 01:21:30,078
<i>Keep your head covered and wear your hat</i>

1511
01:21:30,185 --> 01:21:32,244
<i>to avoid all the noise that destroys the black</i>

1512
01:21:32,354 --> 01:21:35,016
<i>- Or they take you out, one by one</i>
<i>- Basted, baked and done</i>

1513
01:21:35,090 --> 01:21:38,423
<i>A nigga dead from exposure to the sun</i>
<i>Victims of hostile elements</i>

1514
01:21:38,493 --> 01:21:40,927
<i>Not so swell events</i>
<i>Designed to keep the black irrelevant</i>

1515
01:21:54,142 --> 01:21:56,337
<i>Busted caps and breathed the truth</i>

1516
01:21:56,444 --> 01:21:57,911
<i>Wearing hats and save the youth</i>

1517
01:21:57,979 --> 01:22:00,880
<i>While you drinkin' 40s and eight ball</i>
<i>I'm takin' a roll call</i>

1518
01:22:01,016 --> 01:22:02,711
<i>To see who'll fight the white, y'all</i>

1519
01:22:11,192 --> 01:22:13,319
<i>Fresh from the battle but not fatigued</i>

1520
01:22:13,395 --> 01:22:15,454
<i>Perhaps get a medal for avoiding debris</i>

1521
01:22:15,530 --> 01:22:17,521
<i>Yo, G, they stole</i>
<i>the Kangol right off my head</i>

1522
01:22:26,241 --> 01:22:28,505
<i>It really don't matter</i>
<i>just put a lid on it</i>

1523
01:22:28,677 --> 01:22:30,577
<i>They want nothing but to see you fall</i>

1524
01:22:30,679 --> 01:22:32,579
<i>They wanna keep a brother buried and bald</i>

1525
01:22:40,021 --> 01:22:41,318
<i>Wear your hat</i>

1526
01:22:41,523 --> 01:22:43,150
<i>Here come the bullshit</i>

1527
01:23:09,684 --> 01:23:13,780
See, N.W.H., or Niggaz With Hats,
as we <i>prefer...</i>

1528
01:23:13,855 --> 01:23:16,085
I mean, we have all kinds of hats.

1529
01:23:16,157 --> 01:23:19,923
<i>I'm</i> talking beanies, Kangols, <i>fedoras...</i>

1530
01:23:19,995 --> 01:23:23,294
- Scarves, <i>babushkas...</i>
- Baseball caps, beanies.

1531
01:23:23,365 --> 01:23:25,390
- Yarmulkes.
- Yarmulkes?

1532
01:23:25,467 --> 01:23:29,801
Yarmulkes! <i>I'm</i> talking about
some really fresh motherfucking hats...

1533
01:23:29,904 --> 01:23:31,599
in a wide variety.

1534
01:23:31,806 --> 01:23:34,832
Well you certainly do have
some very interesting hats.

1535
01:23:35,210 --> 01:23:37,735
- Oh, we're always moving.
- Never sit still.

1536
01:23:37,812 --> 01:23:39,837
- We like the wind.
- Outta here.

1537
01:23:41,216 --> 01:23:45,949
Take away the pornography,
take away the women-bashing...

1538
01:23:46,021 --> 01:23:50,014
Take away the "kill <i>whitey"</i> stuff.
Take it all away...

1539
01:23:50,825 --> 01:23:53,123
and you got the kids next door,
you really do.

1540
01:23:53,194 --> 01:23:55,492
- Next door to you?
- Not me.

1541
01:23:57,098 --> 01:23:59,464
Now, why do you need
so many tennis shoes?

1542
01:23:59,667 --> 01:24:04,229
Well, you know, for some men
a car is an extension of himself.

1543
01:24:05,473 --> 01:24:09,000
Tennis shoes are for me
an extension of who I am.

1544
01:24:09,177 --> 01:24:11,941
- Plus, I get them for free.
- You've got an endorsement?

1545
01:24:12,781 --> 01:24:17,445
My cousin Ricky endorses me all the time.
He works down at the shoe store in the mall.

1546
01:24:17,519 --> 01:24:20,886
This is my first pair. He gave me those
for my very first concert.

1547
01:24:21,923 --> 01:24:24,483
I want you all to understand something.
When I say nigga...

1548
01:24:24,559 --> 01:24:27,926
I <i>don't</i> mean nigga in the way
a lot of people mean nigga.

1549
01:24:27,996 --> 01:24:30,055
To me, nigga means a whole different thing.

1550
01:24:30,131 --> 01:24:32,531
Check this out. Nigga stands for:

1551
01:24:32,600 --> 01:24:37,765
Naturally, Intelligence, Gonna, Get, Ahead.

1552
01:24:37,839 --> 01:24:40,103
But you might wanna take it
further than that.

1553
01:24:40,175 --> 01:24:43,975
Like you might say that nigga stands for:
Naturally, Intelligent, Gonna, Get...

1554
01:24:44,045 --> 01:24:44,875
that Ass.

1555
01:24:44,946 --> 01:24:47,005
<i>There's</i> no <i>"T"</i> in there.
That would be "niggta."

1556
01:24:47,215 --> 01:24:49,877
You pretend <i>it's</i> there.
You got: Naturally, Intelligent...

1557
01:24:49,951 --> 01:24:51,077
Gonna, Get, Ass.

1558
01:24:51,152 --> 01:24:54,713
Then that ASS stands for
Naturally, Intelligent, Gonna, Get...

1559
01:24:55,123 --> 01:24:59,753
A-Another, S-System, S-Started.

1560
01:25:00,662 --> 01:25:04,598
This is a bazooka, see?
And you just pick this up like this.

1561
01:25:08,403 --> 01:25:12,965
<i>It's</i> kind of heavy. But I figured
if I <i>couldn't</i> pick it up, I need to have it.

1562
01:25:13,041 --> 01:25:14,668
Why would you need a bazooka?

1563
01:25:15,310 --> 01:25:18,871
Sometimes you gotta take out
stuff like a bus...

1564
01:25:19,080 --> 01:25:22,311
or a building or a bunch of motherfuckers.

1565
01:25:22,917 --> 01:25:26,409
Do you worry that you have many enemies?
More than the average guy?

1566
01:25:26,488 --> 01:25:29,252
So what you trying to say?
That <i>I'm</i> paranoid and stuff?

1567
01:25:29,324 --> 01:25:31,519
Do I look like a paranoid person?

1568
01:25:31,626 --> 01:25:36,086
I mean, when you rolling with this,
would you be paranoid?

1569
01:25:38,066 --> 01:25:42,662
This is, as per my song <i>Booty Juice,</i>
bottled Booty Juice. This is gonna be big.

1570
01:25:42,737 --> 01:25:45,262
Check it out. Let me turn on
the Booty Juice display.

1571
01:25:46,808 --> 01:25:50,005
<i>It's</i> not pasteurized,
it <i>ain't</i> from concentrate.

1572
01:25:50,078 --> 01:25:52,740
And I'll tell you what,
we're just like Evian around here.

1573
01:25:52,814 --> 01:25:55,783
We get our Booty Juice
straight from the source.

1574
01:25:57,252 --> 01:26:00,585
And I see you got a little source behind you
we might be able to use.

1575
01:26:00,655 --> 01:26:02,885
Thanks, I like to keep my juices to myself.

1576
01:26:02,957 --> 01:26:05,755
Let me know if we can ever stick
a tap into that...

1577
01:26:05,827 --> 01:26:08,057
and we can all make some money.

1578
01:26:09,430 --> 01:26:12,763
What exactly is the difference
between a ho and a bitch?

1579
01:26:13,168 --> 01:26:15,659
A ho fucks everybody.

1580
01:26:16,070 --> 01:26:20,234
Right, but a bitch fucks everybody but you.

1581
01:26:23,511 --> 01:26:27,413
Now this is something
from back in my more troubled days.

1582
01:26:27,482 --> 01:26:29,814
Back when I was <i>bangin'</i>
like you <i>wouldn't</i> believe.

1583
01:26:30,418 --> 01:26:33,478
- This was my angry shoe, I called it.
- Why?

1584
01:26:33,621 --> 01:26:38,490
Because it was two or three sizes too small,
so you put it on, right away you angry.

1585
01:26:38,860 --> 01:26:40,589
Especially if you walk a block or two.

1586
01:26:40,662 --> 01:26:41,651
Make your face <i>go...</i>

1587
01:26:42,430 --> 01:26:44,955
You know, I was angry at Rick for months
after that shit.

1588
01:26:46,301 --> 01:26:51,500
Look at this, I saw this laying over here.
The N.W.H. Divider and shit.

1589
01:26:51,806 --> 01:26:55,139
This is when you know you <i>blowin'</i> up
major, crazy large...

1590
01:26:55,210 --> 01:26:57,735
because they take you out
of that generic <i>"N"</i> bullshit...

1591
01:26:57,812 --> 01:26:59,143
where they put the wack niggas...

1592
01:26:59,214 --> 01:27:01,739
that had one or two fucked-up albums.

1593
01:27:02,917 --> 01:27:05,044
We got some hats now, motherfuckers.

1594
01:27:05,119 --> 01:27:08,577
Okay, and we <i>ain't</i> too tired
to bust a cap in your ass.

1595
01:27:08,923 --> 01:27:09,912
Believe that.
