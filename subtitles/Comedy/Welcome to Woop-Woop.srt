1
00:00:50,917 --> 00:00:54,876
September 1950,
in the thick of the Korean War,

2
00:00:55,021 --> 00:01:00,287
Allied Forces led by WWII hero
MacArthur succeed in Incheon Landing.

3
00:01:01,026 --> 00:01:03,790
Most of the Communist People's
Army soldiers

4
00:01:03,929 --> 00:01:08,195
were isolated by this operation
died or hid deep in the mountains.

5
00:01:09,535 --> 00:01:12,902
Allied Forces carried out
indiscriminate bombings

6
00:01:13,038 --> 00:01:16,006
to clear out
the People's Army everywhere.

7
00:01:16,741 --> 00:01:21,508
Some of these places were
civilian areas.

8
00:01:35,926 --> 00:01:41,489
Welcome to Dongmakgol

9
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,965
Contact the general.

10
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:06,077
Yes, sir.

11
00:03:55,423 --> 00:03:56,685
High Comrade.

12
00:03:57,825 --> 00:03:59,793
We can't go on like this.

13
00:04:14,808 --> 00:04:16,275
Give the order, comrade.

14
00:04:26,119 --> 00:04:28,177
High Comrade, let us live!
Let us live!

15
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,185
Let us live, please!

16
00:04:30,322 --> 00:04:33,485
High Comrade,
please take me with you.

17
00:04:35,027 --> 00:04:38,394
Why aren't you following
orders from Command?

18
00:04:38,831 --> 00:04:40,696
Please take me with you.

19
00:04:41,233 --> 00:04:42,291
Comrades!

20
00:04:42,434 --> 00:04:43,957
You can't keep doing this.

21
00:04:44,102 --> 00:04:46,468
I can go, I can make it!

22
00:04:46,604 --> 00:04:47,593
Look

23
00:04:48,506 --> 00:04:49,495
Look!

24
00:04:50,308 --> 00:04:51,900
I can make it alone.

25
00:04:52,243 --> 00:04:54,473
I can make it alone.

26
00:04:54,779 --> 00:04:56,041
High Comrade!

27
00:05:01,118 --> 00:05:03,678
One more word out of
you and you're dead.

28
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,458
We are taking all of them with us.

29
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:58,135
Watch out!

30
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:04,371
Get up!

31
00:06:11,718 --> 00:06:13,276
Comrades!

32
00:07:31,692 --> 00:07:32,852
What's your problem?

33
00:07:33,394 --> 00:07:35,453
What are you doing? Huh?

34
00:07:36,597 --> 00:07:37,757
Mister?

35
00:07:44,004 --> 00:07:45,164
Please...

36
00:07:46,706 --> 00:07:48,640
Don't kill me

37
00:07:49,776 --> 00:07:50,970
Please!

38
00:08:33,617 --> 00:08:37,747
How will we ever get to
Pyongyang like this?

39
00:08:37,888 --> 00:08:41,153
Unless you want to get caught
and killed, follow me.

40
00:08:42,292 --> 00:08:46,057
Are you sure we'll make it?

41
00:08:47,797 --> 00:08:49,162
Don't worry.

42
00:08:49,699 --> 00:08:52,065
I'll protect you, no matter...

43
00:09:05,013 --> 00:09:06,378
Damn it!

44
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:39,069
We'll move after sunset,
so get some sleep.

45
00:09:55,894 --> 00:09:58,556
I'm Moon Sang-sang.

46
00:09:59,197 --> 00:10:01,563
I don't know your story, but, still...

47
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:04,668
you shouldn't just go and do that!

48
00:10:07,004 --> 00:10:10,167
What unit are you from?

49
00:10:11,008 --> 00:10:13,568
I'm real glad to
meet up with you here.

50
00:10:14,612 --> 00:10:16,170
Ex-excuse me?

51
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:20,550
It's dangerous to go off by yourself!

52
00:10:30,594 --> 00:10:31,754
What was that?

53
00:10:32,596 --> 00:10:35,156
- I think it was a person.
- Hey! What is it?

54
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:56,744
There are snakes!

55
00:11:00,588 --> 00:11:02,647
Snakes here.

56
00:11:03,491 --> 00:11:05,959
This is a Snake Rock.

57
00:11:08,595 --> 00:11:11,962
Was that you just now,
swished past?

58
00:11:12,199 --> 00:11:13,461
You saw?

59
00:11:13,967 --> 00:11:15,161
You saw me!

60
00:11:15,402 --> 00:11:16,869
I'm kinda fast.

61
00:11:17,004 --> 00:11:20,167
I'm real strange.
I don't run out of breath...

62
00:11:20,307 --> 00:11:23,936
And I swing my arms like this
And my legs get faster,

63
00:11:24,076 --> 00:11:28,137
and then
my arms get faster, and then...

64
00:11:28,381 --> 00:11:31,942
The ground rushes past, and...

65
00:11:32,084 --> 00:11:37,954
- I'm real fast
- What are you talking about?

66
00:11:38,691 --> 00:11:40,555
Your arms go like that,

67
00:11:41,793 --> 00:11:43,658
- and then your legs get...?
- High Comrade!

68
00:11:44,896 --> 00:11:46,659
She has a flower in her hair.

69
00:11:49,801 --> 00:11:52,167
Don't lie here.

70
00:11:52,303 --> 00:11:56,363
Snake bites hurt big.

71
00:11:56,607 --> 00:11:58,837
They hurt really big!

72
00:11:59,877 --> 00:12:01,037
Don't move!

73
00:12:03,781 --> 00:12:05,646
Still there?

74
00:12:05,783 --> 00:12:07,375
Come out of there.

75
00:12:07,985 --> 00:12:09,612
Come on!

76
00:12:10,387 --> 00:12:12,854
Idiots!

77
00:12:39,481 --> 00:12:42,848
Wow! What was that noise?

78
00:12:43,285 --> 00:12:46,549
How wonderful!

79
00:12:50,191 --> 00:12:51,453
Flowers!

80
00:12:56,997 --> 00:12:58,259
Pretty?

81
00:13:03,069 --> 00:13:04,730
Dumb bitch...

82
00:13:04,871 --> 00:13:07,431
High Comrade!

83
00:13:07,574 --> 00:13:09,041
- Let go! Let go of me!
- Please be calm

84
00:13:09,175 --> 00:13:11,837
I'll kill you too
Let go of me!

85
00:13:11,978 --> 00:13:13,536
- Let go of me!
- Calm down, sir!

86
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,238
Where's she going?

87
00:13:15,482 --> 00:13:16,846
Give it here, comrade!

88
00:13:26,492 --> 00:13:29,461
Must be a village here.

89
00:13:29,995 --> 00:13:35,762
Then, maybe the Puppet Army, too?

90
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,327
No way there's any army here.

91
00:13:40,772 --> 00:13:44,833
Shouted with a gun,
but she didn't even blink...

92
00:13:44,976 --> 00:13:47,240
Never seen this kinda thing before.

93
00:13:49,179 --> 00:13:50,840
No way there's any army here.

94
00:13:54,184 --> 00:13:55,344
Come over here.

95
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:02,956
First, we need find the village.

96
00:14:03,293 --> 00:14:05,351
We'll get there and eat

97
00:14:05,895 --> 00:14:07,556
- And get somee food...
- High Comrade!

98
00:14:08,798 --> 00:14:11,926
There might be snakes,
so let's go elsewhere and talk

99
00:14:24,779 --> 00:14:26,337
Where are you going?

100
00:14:26,981 --> 00:14:28,949
Didn't you hear there
are snakes?

101
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:31,449
But, we're the People's Army!

102
00:14:31,586 --> 00:14:33,747
People's Army can't get bit and die?

103
00:14:33,888 --> 00:14:37,050
We have no bullets.
You wanna pull a grenade?

104
00:14:37,191 --> 00:14:41,855
- Look, even High Comrade is going.
- I'm not going for fear of snakes.

105
00:14:43,664 --> 00:14:45,825
Then why are you, sir?

106
00:15:13,391 --> 00:15:16,451
What kind of greeting is that?

107
00:15:16,595 --> 00:15:18,927
Thrusting a stick in a man's face

108
00:15:20,866 --> 00:15:25,131
Is there really a village
up this way?

109
00:15:25,269 --> 00:15:27,430
You think I'd take you
if there weren't?

110
00:15:28,072 --> 00:15:30,040
Geez, this is one tough climb!

111
00:15:31,475 --> 00:15:34,638
We could take
an easier road if you want.

112
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:38,445
But we'd get there tomorrow.

113
00:15:48,391 --> 00:15:51,827
Do you always use that route?

114
00:15:52,262 --> 00:15:55,026
We don't come out often.

115
00:15:55,164 --> 00:15:56,721
But a while ago,

116
00:15:56,865 --> 00:16:00,232
this big guy drop down...

117
00:16:00,369 --> 00:16:03,930
He's real sick so I came out
to pick some medicinal herbs.

118
00:16:17,785 --> 00:16:20,049
A village way up here!

119
00:16:27,461 --> 00:16:30,122
This is our village, Dongmakgol.

120
00:16:32,265 --> 00:16:33,823
Dongmakgol?

121
00:16:34,467 --> 00:16:38,733
They say it's named that so
we'd live carefree, like children.

122
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:42,637
Live carefree?

123
00:16:44,277 --> 00:16:46,437
I don't know
what's behind it.

124
00:16:46,578 --> 00:16:50,446
Just always been called like that,
since way back.

125
00:17:33,956 --> 00:17:35,924
How are you?

126
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,925
What?

127
00:17:39,962 --> 00:17:41,520
How are you?

128
00:17:42,264 --> 00:17:45,233
How do you think I am?
Uh?

129
00:17:45,668 --> 00:17:48,693
How do you think I am?
Look at me!

130
00:17:50,939 --> 00:17:52,566
I mean, look at me.

131
00:17:53,975 --> 00:17:57,274
I'm tied up with sticks

132
00:17:57,379 --> 00:17:59,973
You know I feel like shit!

133
00:18:00,648 --> 00:18:02,548
- Shit!
- Not going well?

134
00:18:03,651 --> 00:18:06,619
It's strange...

135
00:18:06,754 --> 00:18:09,723
You can see,
like it says here, sir...

136
00:18:09,857 --> 00:18:13,224
- I can't read that.
- Yes, sir.

137
00:18:13,494 --> 00:18:17,191
Well, if I say,
'How are you? '

138
00:18:17,364 --> 00:18:22,926
He should say,
'Fine, and you? '

139
00:18:23,069 --> 00:18:25,128
That's the right
American answer...

140
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:29,332
So then I can say,
'I'm fine'

141
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:33,241
Only then is this a completed thing,

142
00:18:33,379 --> 00:18:34,744
but he's a bit...

143
00:18:34,881 --> 00:18:38,407
Why isn't he doing as he should?

144
00:18:40,052 --> 00:18:42,111
Is he picking a fight?

145
00:18:42,554 --> 00:18:45,523
Let's try a bit more.

146
00:18:45,657 --> 00:18:47,215
Do you...
Do you speak english?

147
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:48,724
Village Chief!

148
00:18:51,763 --> 00:18:53,320
Dal-soo's bringing some folks!

149
00:18:53,464 --> 00:18:55,932
From the mountain below!

150
00:18:56,067 --> 00:18:59,230
- Where they from?
- Come see!

151
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:01,531
They've got gourds
on their heads,

152
00:19:01,672 --> 00:19:05,130
and real long sticks
in their hands!

153
00:19:06,177 --> 00:19:07,735
Village Chief, come quick!

154
00:19:20,156 --> 00:19:21,589
Thank you.

155
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:23,220
No, no. Wait, wait!

156
00:19:23,359 --> 00:19:27,624
Wait a second, come back here.
Hey come back here, man!

157
00:19:27,763 --> 00:19:28,730
Wait, don't go anywhere.
Come back!

158
00:19:28,864 --> 00:19:29,831
O... Ok, Ok, Ok.

159
00:19:29,965 --> 00:19:32,934
Wait, come back!
Come back!

160
00:19:46,447 --> 00:19:48,506
They got lost, sir.

161
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:50,808
They're gonna sleep over.

162
00:19:51,252 --> 00:19:53,220
We'll just stay a night, sir.

163
00:19:53,354 --> 00:19:55,515
We're good people.

164
00:19:57,357 --> 00:19:59,018
Welcome!

165
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:02,620
You've come far.

166
00:20:02,762 --> 00:20:05,026
This is our Village Chief.

167
00:20:08,568 --> 00:20:10,832
Have you had something to eat?

168
00:20:16,642 --> 00:20:19,202
How're you feeling?

169
00:20:19,345 --> 00:20:22,712
With these herbs,
you'll be up in no time.

170
00:20:27,553 --> 00:20:29,213
He's UN, sir.

171
00:20:40,865 --> 00:20:43,231
I knew it!

172
00:20:43,368 --> 00:20:45,232
I knew it! I knew you guys would
come to get me.

173
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:49,135
Thank you so much you guys.
Thank god you guys are here.

174
00:20:49,273 --> 00:20:50,103
Thank god.

175
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:55,769
My name is Captain Neal Smith
Captain Neal Smith of US Navy

176
00:20:55,979 --> 00:20:58,573
Thank god you guys have come.

177
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:10,183
How come there's only two of you?

178
00:21:11,194 --> 00:21:12,957
Where's the rest of you guys?

179
00:21:14,263 --> 00:21:15,730
Do you guys understand me?

180
00:21:18,066 --> 00:21:19,431
Hey, where you goin?

181
00:21:19,568 --> 00:21:21,627
Wait, wait! Where you goin?
Come back! Get back here!

182
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:23,203
How did he...?

183
00:21:23,371 --> 00:21:27,205
Dropped from the sky,
three or four days ago.

184
00:21:29,077 --> 00:21:30,772
He almost died...

185
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:44,915
How do I look?

186
00:21:45,893 --> 00:21:49,259
It's sleeping.
Don't make noise.

187
00:21:49,362 --> 00:21:52,820
Be quiet!

188
00:21:52,966 --> 00:21:57,198
My fault, asking a crazy girl.

189
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:08,002
Dong-goo, am I
one of those crazy girls?

190
00:22:08,213 --> 00:22:11,979
Is there more than
one crazy girl in our village?

191
00:22:13,185 --> 00:22:15,210
You put flowers
in your hair, don't you?

192
00:22:17,489 --> 00:22:21,322
- Do lots know beside you?
- Sure.

193
00:22:24,362 --> 00:22:26,592
Just as long as
Teacher Kim doesn't know.

194
00:22:26,764 --> 00:22:30,427
He says so,
that you're crazy.

195
00:22:46,049 --> 00:22:47,311
Walk faster!

196
00:22:54,056 --> 00:22:57,719
Snakes not bite
while I was away?

197
00:22:59,295 --> 00:23:03,391
Guess not.
You look fine.

198
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:11,035
It's Teacher Kim!

199
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:14,399
Well, who's this?

200
00:23:32,693 --> 00:23:34,718
It's too noisy.
Shut up, kids!

201
00:23:34,961 --> 00:23:38,727
Be quiet!

202
00:23:40,534 --> 00:23:43,001
Seems this song never ends.

203
00:23:43,769 --> 00:23:46,237
Teacher Kim, why are your hands up?

204
00:23:53,979 --> 00:23:57,107
Something good must be about to
happen in our village.

205
00:23:57,248 --> 00:23:59,648
So many folks from
down the mountain.

206
00:24:02,587 --> 00:24:04,817
How do you know it'll be good?

207
00:24:07,726 --> 00:24:09,125
A war?

208
00:24:09,294 --> 00:24:12,991
- You say a war's started?
- Yes!

209
00:24:13,164 --> 00:24:17,793
Where'd they invade from?
Are they Japs or Chinks?

210
00:24:17,935 --> 00:24:21,393
Well, it isn't another country
that invaded...

211
00:24:22,573 --> 00:24:24,700
Wait a minute,
is it another country?

212
00:24:24,842 --> 00:24:27,743
Well the thing is,
our National Army is fighting

213
00:24:28,245 --> 00:24:32,806
the Puppet Army from the North!

214
00:24:37,253 --> 00:24:41,815
Then, whose side is the
big-nosed guy on?

215
00:24:43,326 --> 00:24:48,285
Wife, he must be on this side.
They knew him right off.

216
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:49,488
That's right.

217
00:24:49,831 --> 00:24:54,131
Then it's 2 to 1.
That's not fair!

218
00:24:54,236 --> 00:24:58,400
Well the thing is, you shouldn't
look at it that way, ma'am...

219
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:00,030
It's the kids!

220
00:25:00,675 --> 00:25:03,444
They're all up, coming here.
They should be home.

221
00:25:03,444 --> 00:25:06,470
My goodness, Teacher Kim,
you're right on time.

222
00:25:06,547 --> 00:25:10,210
Say hello.
We have guests from outside.

223
00:25:10,317 --> 00:25:13,252
We have guests
over here, too, sir.

224
00:25:27,033 --> 00:25:30,002
Sons of bitches, I'll kill you!

225
00:25:30,136 --> 00:25:32,104
Don't move or you're dead!

226
00:25:32,472 --> 00:25:34,564
Put down the gun, jerk!
Or I'll kill you all!

227
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:36,808
- Put down the gun
- I'll kill you!

228
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:44,110
- Son of a bitch!
- Don't move!

229
00:25:44,249 --> 00:25:46,308
Don't move!

230
00:25:48,887 --> 00:25:50,649
Get inside!
Take the kids and get inside!

231
00:25:50,888 --> 00:25:52,150
Take them inside!

232
00:25:55,226 --> 00:25:56,591
Hey, move!

233
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:02,857
It's alright, folks, don't move!

234
00:26:04,602 --> 00:26:06,660
- I said don't move!
- Don't move!

235
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:08,164
Don't move!

236
00:26:09,206 --> 00:26:11,868
You son of a bitche, get off!

237
00:26:24,687 --> 00:26:26,917
No army here, you said.

238
00:26:27,022 --> 00:26:29,786
What's up with
all the decisions you make?

239
00:26:30,826 --> 00:26:34,887
They're within ten paces.
Three of us, two of them.

240
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:37,497
- Let's take them!
- Just stay put.

241
00:26:41,135 --> 00:26:44,536
Shit! I told you we shouldn't
come way up here!

242
00:26:44,639 --> 00:26:45,799
Hey!

243
00:26:49,244 --> 00:26:51,610
He's calling you.

244
00:26:53,348 --> 00:26:56,316
Since you put your finger in the trigger,
then you should pull it.

245
00:26:57,417 --> 00:26:58,975
What's there to think about?

246
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:03,889
Have you forgotten
we've no bullets left?

247
00:27:04,024 --> 00:27:06,492
Don't talk too tough.

248
00:27:08,128 --> 00:27:10,493
Let's take this elsewhere!

249
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:14,788
Are you crazy?
There's... there's three of them!

250
00:27:14,934 --> 00:27:18,199
Let's leave these innocent villagers
out of it and let's go elsewhere!

251
00:27:18,671 --> 00:27:22,835
- Don't mind us. It's okay.
- Suk-yong.

252
00:27:47,231 --> 00:27:49,096
Listen up closely!

253
00:27:50,334 --> 00:27:54,100
Puppet Army and villagers alike,
with one false move...

254
00:27:55,839 --> 00:27:57,806
...and you're all dead.

255
00:27:58,641 --> 00:28:01,201
I'm serious now.

256
00:28:10,086 --> 00:28:13,055
You got them all mad!

257
00:28:15,624 --> 00:28:19,583
- Is that a rock?
- It's like a lump of metal

258
00:28:19,728 --> 00:28:22,196
What's it for?

259
00:28:24,132 --> 00:28:28,398
I'll tell you later,
just do as they say, folks.

260
00:28:29,137 --> 00:28:31,604
I asked over here,
not there.

261
00:28:31,739 --> 00:28:32,706
God damn it!

262
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:35,502
You turning your back on
me too, Teacher Kim?

263
00:28:37,011 --> 00:28:40,071
- Looks like a potato...
- Damn sons of bitches...

264
00:28:41,916 --> 00:28:44,180
Think I'm kidding?

265
00:28:44,318 --> 00:28:46,285
Maybe they painted one of these?

266
00:28:46,419 --> 00:28:49,877
If that's a potato, my wife eats
four of those a day?

267
00:28:50,023 --> 00:28:52,184
Everyone put your hands up!

268
00:28:52,325 --> 00:28:53,485
Yes, sir!

269
00:28:54,828 --> 00:28:57,695
Hands up, everyone,
before something happens!

270
00:28:57,831 --> 00:29:01,597
- Just one hand?
- Which hand?

271
00:29:01,734 --> 00:29:05,795
- What do we do with them up?
- Put them both up, folks.

272
00:29:06,672 --> 00:29:09,800
- What will happen?
- Everybody hands up

273
00:29:14,013 --> 00:29:15,571
Village Chief!

274
00:29:23,621 --> 00:29:25,088
Get up there!

275
00:29:26,591 --> 00:29:29,059
Damn it, get up there quick!

276
00:29:29,127 --> 00:29:32,290
- Come. Come on up here!
- Hurry, hurry.

277
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:34,358
These folks is all riled up!

278
00:29:34,965 --> 00:29:39,061
Hurry up, hurry!
Hurry, up here!

279
00:29:39,403 --> 00:29:43,806
- Yong-bong, what kept you so late?
- Checking the bee hives, sir.

280
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:45,670
But, we've got bigger troubles!

281
00:29:45,942 --> 00:29:47,807
You should talk with your hands up.

282
00:29:49,312 --> 00:29:52,576
Yeah, you should put them up!

283
00:29:52,715 --> 00:29:56,082
You know the potato field
next to the hives?

284
00:29:56,218 --> 00:29:58,083
- The one we just planted?
- Yeah, there

285
00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:01,485
Wild boars rooted up a path
right through it!

286
00:30:04,927 --> 00:30:08,384
It doesn't look like it was just
one or two boars.

287
00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:14,093
The year before last,
they went into the cornfield and,

288
00:30:14,235 --> 00:30:15,702
- we starved for a whole month in the winter!
- That's right!

289
00:30:15,837 --> 00:30:20,774
Now, now, don't get worked up.
Let's talk it over calmly.

290
00:30:20,909 --> 00:30:22,068
Look here.

291
00:30:25,312 --> 00:30:26,973
Do you not see this?

292
00:30:27,715 --> 00:30:29,979
Worried about stupid boars?

293
00:30:30,117 --> 00:30:33,177
If I open this up, this yard will be
strewn with corpses!

294
00:30:37,324 --> 00:30:38,688
But, hey...

295
00:30:40,827 --> 00:30:42,795
Are you friends with those guys?

296
00:30:47,967 --> 00:30:50,128
- She's making me crazy...
- Have you eaten?

297
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:04,310
Comrade,
this is a weird village...

298
00:31:04,416 --> 00:31:06,077
Shut up, damn it!

299
00:31:13,524 --> 00:31:14,991
Now what's that?

300
00:31:16,827 --> 00:31:18,488
It's a Yankee, sir.

301
00:31:28,605 --> 00:31:30,266
Kicking up a ruckus...

302
00:31:32,208 --> 00:31:36,474
Yelling so much I can't sleep!

303
00:31:36,613 --> 00:31:39,377
Why don't you just yell in my ear...

304
00:31:39,516 --> 00:31:46,318
Get up, Grandma, quit sleeping'?
Rotten offspring!

305
00:31:46,421 --> 00:31:48,082
Look, old lady, don't move!

306
00:31:48,223 --> 00:31:51,590
Where should I poo, then.

307
00:31:51,727 --> 00:31:53,194
My mother.

308
00:31:57,533 --> 00:31:59,557
- What do we do about the boars?
- Catch'em

309
00:31:59,801 --> 00:32:02,895
- How?
- What're you worried about?

310
00:32:03,037 --> 00:32:04,299
Listen

311
00:32:04,405 --> 00:32:08,671
A boar shows up, you grab his neck
with your left hand

312
00:32:08,810 --> 00:32:12,075
Hit him in the eye three times
with your right

313
00:32:12,213 --> 00:32:14,373
Then his eye's will turn all black

314
00:32:14,514 --> 00:32:15,879
He goes home like that

315
00:32:16,016 --> 00:32:18,280
and tells his friends

316
00:32:18,418 --> 00:32:21,581
Don't go to Dongmakgol!
It's an awful place.

317
00:32:21,721 --> 00:32:24,690
Then they'll never come back!

318
00:32:24,825 --> 00:32:27,487
If it were you,
got hit thrice in the eye,

319
00:32:27,627 --> 00:32:28,787
what would you do?

320
00:32:28,929 --> 00:32:31,658
Take all the boys back with me!

321
00:32:32,198 --> 00:32:35,361
Then... then we shouldn't hit them!

322
00:32:35,501 --> 00:32:38,368
If they all come back,
we can't get all those eyes.

323
00:32:41,507 --> 00:32:44,476
Damn it...
All of you shut up!

324
00:32:51,015 --> 00:32:52,277
Everyone sit down.

325
00:32:54,319 --> 00:32:56,617
You hear me?
All of you, sit!

326
00:32:57,622 --> 00:32:58,680
Let's sit down.

327
00:33:28,017 --> 00:33:33,284
- Son of a bitch.
- Son uva-bitch!

328
00:33:34,623 --> 00:33:36,750
- Mother fucker
- Mother fucker...!

329
00:33:36,892 --> 00:33:40,350
- Son of a bitch.
- Son uva-bitch!

330
00:33:41,529 --> 00:33:43,053
What is it?

331
00:33:43,198 --> 00:33:44,756
The outhouse, sir.

332
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:47,268
Don't move!

333
00:33:48,803 --> 00:33:51,464
Don't pee your pants.
Come back quick.

334
00:33:56,944 --> 00:34:00,209
Stay in your seat, sir.

335
00:34:00,414 --> 00:34:04,783
Gonna check the bee hives,
you stay right here, okay?

336
00:34:05,619 --> 00:34:07,586
- See you.
- Yeah

337
00:35:42,676 --> 00:35:44,337
A ring!

338
00:35:48,815 --> 00:35:49,839
You crazy fool!

339
00:35:49,983 --> 00:35:52,042
- Secure it safely!
- Comrade!

340
00:35:52,185 --> 00:35:55,348
Idiot,
can't take care of a grenade!

341
00:35:55,555 --> 00:35:56,920
hold still, you!

342
00:36:05,998 --> 00:36:09,661
Unless you study hard,
you can never speak Engish

343
00:36:09,769 --> 00:36:12,431
Wasn't it inquisitive when
Teacher talked with the American?

344
00:36:12,505 --> 00:36:13,870
Yes!

345
00:36:14,006 --> 00:36:17,372
Want to hear what I said to him?

346
00:36:17,509 --> 00:36:19,374
- Yes!
- Yes!

347
00:36:19,511 --> 00:36:28,044
For instance, if I say, 'How are you? ',
they'd say, 'Fine, and you? '

348
00:36:28,353 --> 00:36:32,413
And then I say, 'I'm fine.'

349
00:36:32,589 --> 00:36:37,390
And that would be the correct
American answer.

350
00:36:46,903 --> 00:36:48,768
Take cover!

351
00:37:00,316 --> 00:37:03,978
Teacher Kim, what's going on?

352
00:37:49,596 --> 00:37:53,156
Think this is a dud, too?

353
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:28,170
Moon Sang-sang!

354
00:40:35,884 --> 00:40:41,083
Gosh~how... how can you sleep so?
Don't your backs ache?

355
00:40:55,770 --> 00:40:57,738
Not again!
Not again... shit...

356
00:41:10,183 --> 00:41:14,847
Now, that's enough.
Come eat something.

357
00:41:14,988 --> 00:41:18,856
Don't worry,
this man promised

358
00:41:18,991 --> 00:41:21,858
...so rest now.
- He promise?

359
00:41:22,695 --> 00:41:26,722
Sir, you don't know
these bastards yet!

360
00:41:33,572 --> 00:41:36,631
If you really want blood...

361
00:41:38,476 --> 00:41:41,639
get yourself a sharper tool.

362
00:41:49,187 --> 00:41:52,349
You all sure got vigor.

363
00:41:52,489 --> 00:41:54,150
I'll bring out some food.

364
00:41:54,324 --> 00:41:57,452
So go wash your faces.

365
00:41:57,828 --> 00:42:00,524
This is horrible.
The storage room is ruined.

366
00:42:00,897 --> 00:42:04,355
At least the potatoes got well baked.

367
00:42:04,468 --> 00:42:07,800
- Are we starving from today?
- Something will happen

368
00:42:07,970 --> 00:42:09,631
Don't mind, something will...

369
00:42:22,318 --> 00:42:26,151
Sorry there's not much to eat.

370
00:42:26,287 --> 00:42:29,916
They blew up a whole year's
village provisions and you give them our food!

371
00:42:30,024 --> 00:42:31,719
What's taking you?

372
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:34,328
Just curb your hunger a bit.

373
00:42:34,462 --> 00:42:37,226
Go on, now.
Eat.

374
00:42:37,365 --> 00:42:39,525
What do we live on
when it gets cold?

375
00:42:40,067 --> 00:42:41,932
The storage's empty.

376
00:42:42,169 --> 00:42:44,228
Is there really
nothing at all left?

377
00:42:50,878 --> 00:42:54,336
- Comrades.
- What?

378
00:43:04,957 --> 00:43:09,621
Shouldn't we have gone
with them to the field?

379
00:43:13,131 --> 00:43:16,100
What were you thinking,
tossing it there?

380
00:43:35,686 --> 00:43:37,415
It's strange...

381
00:43:37,555 --> 00:43:39,921
They're just working.

382
00:43:41,258 --> 00:43:44,715
High Comrade, how about we just
dig potatoes for a while...

383
00:43:44,994 --> 00:43:47,963
And join up with the main unit
when they come back south?

384
00:43:51,434 --> 00:43:54,301
The bastards might be
up to something.

385
00:43:54,404 --> 00:43:57,862
We can't just dig
potatoes in peace.

386
00:43:57,941 --> 00:43:59,407
High Comrade...

387
00:43:59,575 --> 00:44:01,668
Let's attack first!

388
00:44:03,645 --> 00:44:05,408
Just do your work.

389
00:44:10,352 --> 00:44:13,185
They all look like
good folks to me.

390
00:44:13,522 --> 00:44:18,788
You don't know anything
about reading people, do you?

391
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:24,330
Yeah, don't mind about what I say.

392
00:45:13,444 --> 00:45:17,073
We'll fill the storage house.
You can leave the mountain.

393
00:45:18,650 --> 00:45:21,117
No good in staying together, is there?

394
00:45:23,153 --> 00:45:28,921
Cut the funny talk.
You leave!

395
00:45:29,059 --> 00:45:31,118
Why don't you wanna leave?

396
00:45:32,262 --> 00:45:36,425
Take that Yankee down
and you'd get a medal.

397
00:45:36,599 --> 00:45:39,762
Careful on your way, comrade.

398
00:45:40,870 --> 00:45:44,135
Down the mountain, People's Army
must be covering the area.

399
00:45:46,409 --> 00:45:52,369
You three are probably the only commie reds
on this entire mountain.

400
00:45:56,551 --> 00:45:58,815
Allied Forces have landed at Incheon.

401
00:45:59,187 --> 00:46:04,318
They've probably pushed up
to Pyongyang by now.

402
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:09,328
South of that, nothing but
commie corpses scattered below...

403
00:46:09,463 --> 00:46:13,524
- All red!
- Son of a bitch! Quit your crap!

404
00:46:18,973 --> 00:46:21,942
You're the ones should be careful.

405
00:46:25,445 --> 00:46:31,509
If they've taken Pyongyang...
we're in big trouble.

406
00:46:32,952 --> 00:46:37,787
Sergeant, you believe that shit?

407
00:46:38,057 --> 00:46:42,220
Then what are those jerks doing
in these rough mountains?

408
00:46:42,361 --> 00:46:46,058
It's nonsense.
Don't be taken in by it.

409
00:46:50,769 --> 00:46:54,830
They might've run off from their unit.

410
00:47:01,545 --> 00:47:03,604
Aren't you gonna sleep?

411
00:47:04,348 --> 00:47:06,816
Let's get some sleep.

412
00:47:07,151 --> 00:47:09,346
You wanna get killed in your sleep?

413
00:47:10,354 --> 00:47:15,313
If they wanted to, they woulda done it
when we were sleeping before.

414
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:18,125
Wait a minute!

415
00:47:19,262 --> 00:47:21,787
So why didn't they?

416
00:47:26,803 --> 00:47:29,236
Now the area that
the C8O2 transport plane

417
00:47:29,371 --> 00:47:31,601
went missing is
less than 10 kilometers

418
00:47:31,740 --> 00:47:34,402
from where the C520
transport plane went missing.

419
00:47:34,843 --> 00:47:36,902
Now the reconaissance plane that
we sent to the area

420
00:47:37,046 --> 00:47:38,707
has disappeard as well.

421
00:47:38,847 --> 00:47:42,908
We can't be sure but we assume
that the remnants of the KPA

422
00:47:43,052 --> 00:47:47,044
with the small anti-aircraft base
is stationed there.

423
00:47:47,422 --> 00:47:51,324
Sir, this is
nothing but an assumption.

424
00:47:51,993 --> 00:47:54,553
We need to investigate
the situation further.

425
00:47:58,966 --> 00:48:01,229
The problem is geographical.

426
00:48:01,768 --> 00:48:04,896
This is a position
we cannot move or abandon.

427
00:48:05,038 --> 00:48:07,097
This is a supply route that
we must secure

428
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:11,973
for amphibious approach
from Ganglion to Wonsan and Changin

429
00:48:34,165 --> 00:48:37,396
Gee-whiz... We shouldn't have said
we'd do the work for them.

430
00:48:37,535 --> 00:48:39,196
It'll never be done!

431
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:06,289
Look here.

432
00:49:06,462 --> 00:49:10,899
- How come your face turned all red...
- No way!

433
00:49:12,068 --> 00:49:15,435
I'm just mad we have to be
with those dogs!

434
00:49:16,239 --> 00:49:18,002
Hey, jerk...

435
00:49:18,141 --> 00:49:21,701
You're bad luck for us, too!

436
00:49:21,977 --> 00:49:24,639
- You little jerk...
- Forget about him.

437
00:49:24,746 --> 00:49:28,910
It'd just be embarrassing
to take on a little brat like him.

438
00:49:30,752 --> 00:49:33,915
What, a little brat?!

439
00:49:36,457 --> 00:49:38,322
You son of a bitch.

440
00:49:40,461 --> 00:49:42,224
You want to fight?

441
00:49:43,063 --> 00:49:45,691
Scared?

442
00:49:47,134 --> 00:49:49,227
Yeah... you ought to be scared...

443
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:52,060
That's why you ran away
from your unit.

444
00:49:56,943 --> 00:49:58,706
You little bastard...

445
00:50:03,016 --> 00:50:05,678
Let's not make trouble in the village.

446
00:50:07,853 --> 00:50:10,321
You wanted it that way.

447
00:50:13,325 --> 00:50:16,761
Taek-gi, go in the room.

448
00:50:25,536 --> 00:50:28,505
Son of a bitch...

449
00:50:30,541 --> 00:50:32,406
I'll kill you!

450
00:50:32,844 --> 00:50:35,005
Just be calm

451
00:50:35,847 --> 00:50:36,711
Son of a...

452
00:50:36,781 --> 00:50:39,045
Have you forgotten your promise?

453
00:50:53,997 --> 00:50:56,260
Sparrow A1.
Do you copy, over?

454
00:50:59,235 --> 00:51:01,726
Nest, this is Sparrow A1

455
00:51:01,904 --> 00:51:05,135
Sparrow A1 down
do you copy over?

456
00:51:05,241 --> 00:51:09,302
What's you name, mister?
I'm Dong-goo. Lee Dong-goo.

457
00:51:17,952 --> 00:51:19,317
Copy, that

458
00:51:20,154 --> 00:51:21,519
Sparrow A1?

459
00:51:21,656 --> 00:51:22,623
You're still alive?

460
00:51:22,757 --> 00:51:24,884
I said I'm Dong-goo!

461
00:51:25,026 --> 00:51:28,984
Answer a person
when they talk to you!

462
00:51:33,233 --> 00:51:36,396
Why are you yelling like that?

463
00:51:36,536 --> 00:51:38,197
What's your name?

464
00:51:39,539 --> 00:51:43,202
Wanna go some place interesting?

465
00:51:45,444 --> 00:51:49,676
Sparrow A1, Sparrow A1?
Sparrow A1!

466
00:51:51,851 --> 00:51:53,216
What a strange name!

467
00:51:53,352 --> 00:51:56,981
Then your family name is Seu?

468
00:52:05,130 --> 00:52:07,724
- Mr. Seu Miss, run!
- Oh shit!

469
00:52:20,244 --> 00:52:23,907
What happened to your face?

470
00:52:24,848 --> 00:52:25,815
Dong-goo?

471
00:52:25,950 --> 00:52:29,215
This big nosed mister,
you know his name?

472
00:52:29,353 --> 00:52:33,379
His name is Seu?
Seu...

473
00:52:33,523 --> 00:52:35,388
That's right!
Seu Miss!

474
00:52:35,591 --> 00:52:39,288
Family name's Seu, and
his name is Miss.

475
00:52:39,562 --> 00:52:41,689
Seu Miss?

476
00:52:42,732 --> 00:52:45,701
Seu Miss?

477
00:52:45,835 --> 00:52:47,700
What did you tell them, kid?

478
00:52:47,837 --> 00:52:52,796
- Seu Miss?
- yeah, I'm Smith. Yeah, my name.

479
00:52:53,842 --> 00:52:57,005
- Seu Miss!
- What?

480
00:52:57,446 --> 00:53:00,108
- Seu Miss?
- Seu Miss...

481
00:53:03,418 --> 00:53:04,782
What?

482
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:08,088
What's so fun, kid?

483
00:53:08,222 --> 00:53:11,589
Make them stop.
Make them stop call my name like that.

484
00:53:12,927 --> 00:53:14,485
Seu Miss

485
00:53:15,062 --> 00:53:16,529
Me, Dal-soo!

486
00:53:17,398 --> 00:53:19,059
Na... what?

487
00:53:20,133 --> 00:53:22,499
His name's Seu Miss?

488
00:53:31,644 --> 00:53:37,582
It's almost 9 years since
Dong-goo's pa left home.

489
00:53:37,716 --> 00:53:41,880
Sure, he wanted to see
the outside world, but...

490
00:53:42,021 --> 00:53:45,889
I'm worried sick
Dong-goo will leave, too.

491
00:53:46,025 --> 00:53:52,293
We have to send the outsiders away
before something happens.

492
00:53:52,430 --> 00:53:57,299
If Dong-goo ends up leaving, too,
I'll die!

493
00:54:00,138 --> 00:54:01,503
Fermented bean curd!

494
00:54:18,221 --> 00:54:23,921
I'd be in Jongno
looking good right now...

495
00:54:24,427 --> 00:54:29,387
But those fools had to invade.
Now look at me!

496
00:54:29,532 --> 00:54:31,591
Who invaded who?

497
00:54:32,234 --> 00:54:34,668
You're the oneswho put the U.S. up front
and invaded us!

498
00:54:34,737 --> 00:54:38,696
Shut up, you don't know anything.

499
00:54:38,841 --> 00:54:41,900
You mean we invaded South?

500
00:54:42,010 --> 00:54:45,173
Taeki-gi!
That's enough.

501
00:54:45,313 --> 00:54:47,873
That fool keeps telling lies.

502
00:54:48,183 --> 00:54:49,946
Did we invade the South?

503
00:54:51,553 --> 00:54:53,714
We invaded the South.

504
00:54:54,856 --> 00:54:58,951
We did?

505
00:54:59,793 --> 00:55:01,658
See, you jerk?

506
00:55:03,964 --> 00:55:09,527
I just went south
because they told me to.

507
00:55:15,141 --> 00:55:20,238
Sparrow A1 down! Sparrow A1 down!
Sparrow A1 down!

508
01:00:05,012 --> 01:00:07,173
- Quick, get it!
- Tie it up!

509
01:00:11,486 --> 01:00:12,748
Mother!

510
01:00:41,814 --> 01:00:43,577
Thank you so much.

511
01:00:48,721 --> 01:00:50,347
Are you alright?

512
01:00:50,488 --> 01:00:52,149
Not a scratch!

513
01:00:52,490 --> 01:00:54,219
You're a brave boy!

514
01:01:21,717 --> 01:01:23,082
Second Lieutenant Pyo?

515
01:01:27,790 --> 01:01:31,954
How come these villagers
don't eat meat?

516
01:01:32,094 --> 01:01:34,358
It is because it caused them
so much nuisances?

517
01:01:34,497 --> 01:01:36,556
Why did they bury
such a great thing?

518
01:01:37,199 --> 01:01:38,757
Isn't that right,
Second Lieutenant Pyo?

519
01:01:40,902 --> 01:01:44,235
Back on base, they'd call me whenever
there were any pigs to butcher...

520
01:01:44,306 --> 01:01:45,864
Like that one, I would...

521
01:02:15,001 --> 01:02:16,468
Have a bite!

522
01:03:59,199 --> 01:04:00,530
Good, uh?

523
01:04:20,485 --> 01:04:22,453
Have some more, sir.

524
01:04:22,754 --> 01:04:24,654
This tastes great!

525
01:04:43,240 --> 01:04:56,842
Hey, hey, let's get inside quick.

526
01:05:23,323 --> 01:05:29,558
Looks good on you.

527
01:06:31,448 --> 01:06:37,445
Been so long since I had fat,
it just shoots right through me.

528
01:06:39,253 --> 01:06:41,477
What's your name?

529
01:06:42,364 --> 01:06:46,148
I'm called Lee Soo-hwa.

530
01:06:54,758 --> 01:06:59,445
The medic comrade calls you
Second Lieutenant Pyo?

531
01:07:05,100 --> 01:07:09,581
Thanks for helping
our comrade before.

532
01:07:18,061 --> 01:07:23,575
How about we just pretend
to be comfortable and friendly?

533
01:07:41,535 --> 01:07:44,477
Let me ask you one thing.

534
01:07:45,518 --> 01:07:50,809
When we were sleeping...
why did you let us be?

535
01:08:11,365 --> 01:08:14,797
These are the coordinates
of Captain Smith's last radio transmission.

536
01:08:15,036 --> 01:08:17,085
Now that we can
verify the KPA unit,

537
01:08:17,334 --> 01:08:20,527
there is no reason
to delay the operation.

538
01:08:22,239 --> 01:08:23,558
He's guessing, sir.

539
01:08:23,886 --> 01:08:26,383
I don't think we can make quick
decision based on ambiguous data.

540
01:08:26,775 --> 01:08:28,417
The allied forces
are moving north.

541
01:08:28,925 --> 01:08:30,745
We have to consider the fact that
our winning or loosing depends on

542
01:08:31,410 --> 01:08:33,665
the ability to move
weapons and supplies.

543
01:08:34,007 --> 01:08:35,498
We are over-reacting.

544
01:08:35,906 --> 01:08:38,626
We need more time to investigate

545
01:08:39,693 --> 01:08:43,165
How can you say that.
Obviously, the enemy is there.

546
01:08:44,035 --> 01:08:45,772
There's a chance of
civilian casualty.

547
01:08:46,140 --> 01:08:48,798
We don't have the option
of being sympathetic

548
01:08:49,285 --> 01:08:51,437
And right now,
we don't have the time either.

549
01:08:57,982 --> 01:09:01,647
That is irresponsible.

550
01:09:02,700 --> 01:09:04,991
If we lose this passage, this war will last
much longer than we expected.

551
01:09:08,632 --> 01:09:11,487
China is on the way

552
01:09:17,544 --> 01:09:19,217
You ready man?

553
01:09:34,184 --> 01:09:35,505
You stay here

554
01:09:36,289 --> 01:09:37,041
We run

555
01:09:43,090 --> 01:09:44,057
Hey, stop there!

556
01:10:05,783 --> 01:10:11,520
Where did you get back?

557
01:10:40,763 --> 01:10:44,339
Look here.
There are many curious things.

558
01:10:46,381 --> 01:10:47,525
What is that cloud?

559
01:10:52,793 --> 01:10:54,274
I was big in the U.S. Army Club.

560
01:10:54,843 --> 01:10:57,317
The girls loved me!

561
01:11:00,515 --> 01:11:03,852
Second Lieutenant Pyo, join us!

562
01:11:14,430 --> 01:11:16,825
How is it that...

563
01:11:19,665 --> 01:11:28,043
you have such a hold on the villagers
without ever raising your voice.

564
01:11:28,563 --> 01:11:36,458
What's the secret to
your great leadership?

565
01:11:37,863 --> 01:11:41,262
You just gotta feed them a lot.

566
01:11:42,120 --> 01:11:42,720
Huh?

567
01:13:01,784 --> 01:13:04,569
I can't do it now.
Not now!

568
01:13:06,541 --> 01:13:08,677
You can't make that decision
so easily, sir!

569
01:13:09,069 --> 01:13:11,879
"Are you kidding?
You know what needs to be done!"

570
01:13:12,646 --> 01:13:14,581
The bridge is full of refugees!

571
01:13:16,013 --> 01:13:18,376
- "Shut up and destroy the bridge!"
- No, I tell you, no!

572
01:13:20,009 --> 01:13:21,944
You son of a bitch!
You want to kill all these people?

573
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:24,217
- I can't!
- "It's an order!"

574
01:13:25,002 --> 01:13:26,434
"Do it now! Or, I'll have you executed!"

575
01:13:29,752 --> 01:13:31,490
How am I supposed to
kill all these... all these people?

576
01:13:31,978 --> 01:13:34,256
No! I can't!
How can I kill all of them!

577
01:13:34,857 --> 01:13:37,986
"Need to destroy it before the enemy comes!
Or, we'll lose, you son of a bitch!"

578
01:13:39,187 --> 01:13:42,203
- No way!
- "Destroy the bridge! Now!"

579
01:13:42,731 --> 01:13:44,780
"This is an order!
Right now!"

580
01:14:22,525 --> 01:14:27,197
Your mission is to rescue
Captain Neel Smith at all costs.

581
01:14:33,774 --> 01:14:36,758
An order is in place
to begin bombing your location,

582
01:14:37,368 --> 01:14:40,425
24 hours after
the mission has begun.

583
01:14:43,745 --> 01:14:47,714
So keep this in mind and
get out of there as soon as possible.

584
01:14:49,315 --> 01:14:50,946
May the lord be with you all.

585
01:14:52,267 --> 01:14:53,772
Dismissed!

586
01:14:54,420 --> 01:14:55,412
Attention!

587
01:14:56,308 --> 01:14:57,692
Salute!

588
01:15:12,484 --> 01:15:15,660
There's a U.S. Army Club
in Jongno...

589
01:15:17,264 --> 01:15:18,986
It's my dream to become
the manager there...

590
01:15:22,596 --> 01:15:24,260
With a girl on each arm.

591
01:15:25,340 --> 01:15:26,851
Wouldn't that be great?

592
01:15:28,325 --> 01:15:31,043
But my father doesn't understand.

593
01:15:31,669 --> 01:15:34,939
You'll know how he feels
when you're a father, too.

594
01:15:35,685 --> 01:15:37,718
You sound just like him.

595
01:15:43,103 --> 01:15:45,352
Can I call you elder brother?

596
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:47,615
You're too young.
Call me uncle.

597
01:15:49,382 --> 01:15:49,982
Elder brother's better!

598
01:15:50,326 --> 01:15:51,158
You little pup!

599
01:15:51,735 --> 01:15:52,799
Really, it sounds more friendly.

600
01:15:53,743 --> 01:15:54,847
Do as you like! Gosh!

601
01:15:56,094 --> 01:15:57,279
- Elder brother?
- What?

602
01:15:57,840 --> 01:15:58,800
I'm curious...

603
01:16:04,576 --> 01:16:05,688
The first day you saw us...

604
01:16:07,306 --> 01:16:08,883
Were you really gonna shoot me?

605
01:16:10,242 --> 01:16:13,172
Yeah, but the truth is,
I didn't have any bullets!

606
01:16:14,291 --> 01:16:16,820
- Fooled you!
- What? What? What did you say?

607
01:16:19,228 --> 01:16:20,778
No wonder you were
shaking like that!

608
01:16:21,661 --> 01:16:23,564
How could I shoot you
without any bullets?

609
01:16:42,737 --> 01:16:44,523
High Comrade!

610
01:16:47,019 --> 01:16:50,521
Once the storage house is full...
are we to leave?

611
01:16:58,133 --> 01:16:59,397
I guess we'd have to.

612
01:17:02,116 --> 01:17:04,014
Where would we go?

613
01:17:05,238 --> 01:17:08,966
If Pyongyang's taken and
the Allies are moving north...

614
01:17:09,975 --> 01:17:11,856
We have no place to go.

615
01:17:12,943 --> 01:17:15,664
Neither do we.

616
01:18:18,547 --> 01:18:19,780
Alright... here comes lunch!

617
01:18:23,947 --> 01:18:23,798
- It's here! It's finally here.
- Yeah!

618
01:18:25,967 --> 01:18:27,494
Oh, you've come

619
01:18:27,894 --> 01:18:29,405
- Be careful now.
- Give it to me!

620
01:18:30,823 --> 01:18:31,526
It's fine, give it here.

621
01:18:36,313 --> 01:18:37,575
Give that to me, ma'am!

622
01:18:45,490 --> 01:18:46,851
They've done so much so soon!

623
01:18:48,307 --> 01:18:50,203
Yes, they're strong.

624
01:18:51,491 --> 01:18:52,948
That's not a good thing...

625
01:18:53,426 --> 01:18:56,138
Now that the storage is full,
they'll leave...

626
01:19:02,555 --> 01:19:04,331
Thank you very much.

627
01:19:12,357 --> 01:19:15,533
The storage is full,
but we've nowhere to go...

628
01:19:17,405 --> 01:19:19,831
Maybe we should find
another grenade.

629
01:19:20,639 --> 01:19:23,983
A good toss into the storage house and
we'd be set for another few months.

630
01:19:24,425 --> 01:19:26,681
It's your fault
for working so hard.

631
01:19:27,129 --> 01:19:29,855
We're supposed to be soldiers, not farmers.
It doesn't look good.

632
01:19:32,274 --> 01:19:33,722
That storage house is too small.

633
01:19:34,387 --> 01:19:35,452
Let's rebuild it bigger.

634
01:19:37,027 --> 01:19:38,323
It's all bullshit.

635
01:19:38,788 --> 01:19:39,900
You're mocking me?

636
01:19:46,437 --> 01:19:48,174
Why don't you sing us a song?

637
01:19:48,789 --> 01:19:50,150
What? A song?

638
01:19:53,417 --> 01:19:54,034
- Yeah, come on.
- Nah!

639
01:19:54,498 --> 01:19:55,130
- Come on, sing us something.
- Come on!

640
01:19:55,362 --> 01:19:57,323
You put him on the spot, now he won't sing!
We shouldn't have put him on it

641
01:19:57,683 --> 01:19:58,596
Right!

642
01:19:58,875 --> 01:19:59,892
Maybe just once.

643
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:13,005
# A rolling rhythm...
And a sweet melody...

644
01:20:13,673 --> 01:20:18,620
# A boogie song is...
a song of hope.

645
01:20:21,228 --> 01:20:28,359
# Wipe away those sad tears...
Let's move ahead smiling.

646
01:20:30,455 --> 01:20:36,207
# Stop looking surprised...
Let's sing a happy song.

647
01:20:37,056 --> 01:20:39,632
# Let's sing...

648
01:20:40,416 --> 01:20:43,688
# Boogie woogie...

649
01:21:08,150 --> 01:21:09,406
# Let's sing...

650
01:21:10,822 --> 01:21:13,535
# Boogie woogie...

651
01:21:16,712 --> 01:21:19,241
- Seu Miss!
- Seu Miss!

652
01:21:20,399 --> 01:21:20,845
Try this on.

653
01:21:21,231 --> 01:21:22,703
- Will it fit?
- It'll fit.

654
01:21:24,790 --> 01:21:26,111
What if it doesn't?

655
01:21:27,248 --> 01:21:28,143
It's for me?

656
01:21:29,496 --> 01:21:31,759
It fits well!

657
01:21:35,097 --> 01:21:37,273
# I'll move on singing my heart out!

658
01:21:39,289 --> 01:21:40,897
That was great!

659
01:21:45,163 --> 01:21:47,075
Here some drink

660
01:21:48,085 --> 01:21:50,195
What a good voice!

661
01:21:50,709 --> 01:21:53,476
- That's good. More, please!
- Yo, you are a drinker!

662
01:22:26,132 --> 01:22:27,243
Here some drink

663
01:22:28,513 --> 01:22:32,381
I guess we'll have to go
our separate ways.

664
01:22:34,229 --> 01:22:38,358
Although if we were to meet again in
another war we'd have to use our guns again.

665
01:22:41,966 --> 01:22:44,743
We won't meet again.

666
01:22:49,824 --> 01:22:51,648
I deserted.

667
01:22:54,010 --> 01:22:56,290
If I go back,
it's the firing squad for me.

668
01:22:58,051 --> 01:23:00,193
Since I can't go back to my unit...

669
01:23:01,194 --> 01:23:03,410
we won't be using guns
on each other.

670
01:23:23,192 --> 01:23:24,582
Look at them.

671
01:23:26,672 --> 01:23:28,535
Such a good time.

672
01:23:28,961 --> 01:23:30,154
That's life.

673
01:24:02,506 --> 01:24:04,136
OK, listen up! It's time.

674
01:24:06,265 --> 01:24:08,642
Four minutes before drop.

675
01:24:09,907 --> 01:24:12,323
Now we will be landing
on the hot zone

676
01:24:12,644 --> 01:24:14,268
and the enemy will
outnumber us.

677
01:24:14,916 --> 01:24:17,732
They will not hesitate
to kill us violently.

678
01:24:18,566 --> 01:24:23,342
So let's be prepared
to land on the ground with the rifles firing.

679
01:24:25,022 --> 01:24:27,006
All right gentlemen, good luck.

680
01:24:30,238 --> 01:24:32,808
I'll see you on the ground.

681
01:24:34,642 --> 01:24:37,703
Go! Go! Go!

682
01:24:39,513 --> 01:24:41,514
Get your rifle.
Go! Go!

683
01:26:15,888 --> 01:26:17,896
Nest 1, this is Macpie A2

684
01:26:18,401 --> 01:26:20,970
After drop zone,
only five survived.

685
01:26:21,578 --> 01:26:24,186
Current coordinates,
Delta Hotel 4045

686
01:26:24,562 --> 01:26:27,890
We found the wild dog,
we found the wild dog.

687
01:28:08,301 --> 01:28:11,430
- He's looking at us.
- Then greet him!

688
01:28:12,277 --> 01:28:13,518
I don't think that's it.

689
01:28:14,749 --> 01:28:17,975
If you meet a man's eyes,
you greet them!

690
01:28:20,707 --> 01:28:21,659
Come on, let's!

691
01:28:21,979 --> 01:28:23,147
Welcome!

692
01:28:25,259 --> 01:28:27,467
He's smiling.

693
01:28:27,984 --> 01:28:29,417
You think I'm fucking around.

694
01:28:31,433 --> 01:28:33,426
You think I'm fucking around?

695
01:28:33,994 --> 01:28:35,386
You think I'm playing games?

696
01:28:45,853 --> 01:28:49,934
Your fuck'n communist bastards
are driving my patience thin.

697
01:28:50,345 --> 01:28:52,521
I told you we shouldn't!

698
01:28:53,587 --> 01:28:54,875
Damn it!

699
01:29:23,601 --> 01:29:25,320
You bitch!

700
01:29:27,424 --> 01:29:28,511
You know what happens
when you get shot in the head?

701
01:29:28,999 --> 01:29:29,672
Spill it!

702
01:29:29,952 --> 01:29:31,487
Where are all the commie reds hiding?

703
01:29:35,439 --> 01:29:36,689
Damn girl, I'll kill you!

704
01:29:37,538 --> 01:29:38,834
She's crazy!

705
01:29:39,258 --> 01:29:40,991
You don't treat
a crazy girl like that!

706
01:29:56,686 --> 01:30:00,509
You sound like a Northerner.

707
01:30:02,293 --> 01:30:03,526
Uh?

708
01:30:06,255 --> 01:30:08,056
Sure you're from this village?

709
01:30:13,184 --> 01:30:15,368
Who are your parents?

710
01:30:19,897 --> 01:30:21,939
Has this kid no parents?

711
01:30:27,491 --> 01:30:30,322
- He's my son!
- He's mine!

712
01:30:42,974 --> 01:30:45,103
Why you...!

713
01:31:21,509 --> 01:31:22,784
He's this boy's father!

714
01:31:23,558 --> 01:31:24,894
Father!

715
01:31:25,271 --> 01:31:26,135
What do you want?

716
01:31:26,432 --> 01:31:27,488
fuck are they saying?

717
01:31:27,999 --> 01:31:29,096
It's father

718
01:31:38,457 --> 01:31:41,554
What are you so upset about?

719
01:31:42,561 --> 01:31:44,387
Why don't you calm down?

720
01:31:44,740 --> 01:31:46,499
Who do you think you are, bastard?

721
01:31:47,932 --> 01:31:49,572
Seat your fucking as down

722
01:31:52,619 --> 01:31:55,101
Are you bastards playing with us?

723
01:31:56,854 --> 01:32:01,807
Has anyone among you seen any
commie reds or anti-aircraft guns?

724
01:32:03,590 --> 01:32:05,727
Come forward!

725
01:32:06,599 --> 01:32:08,158
No one?

726
01:32:27,650 --> 01:32:29,978
Still no one?
Damned dogs...

727
01:32:32,629 --> 01:32:36,190
Listen up and watch closely...

728
01:32:37,908 --> 01:32:43,607
Until someone comes forward,
one by one, I'm gonna kill you all!

729
01:32:50,602 --> 01:32:52,833
Back off!

730
01:33:27,527 --> 01:33:31,242
No, wait, don't!
Please...

731
01:33:31,593 --> 01:33:33,201
Don't move!

732
01:33:34,777 --> 01:33:35,921
Don't move, asshole!

733
01:33:40,644 --> 01:33:44,011
Wait, just a second.

734
01:33:54,551 --> 01:33:55,958
Come on!

735
01:33:56,676 --> 01:33:57,988
Tie that bastard up!

736
01:33:59,732 --> 01:34:01,687
Village Chief, are you alright?

737
01:34:06,128 --> 01:34:06,839
Yeo-il!

738
01:34:08,009 --> 01:34:10,456
Yeo-il!
Yeo-il!

739
01:34:11,912 --> 01:34:13,217
What do we do?

740
01:34:14,201 --> 01:34:16,179
Dear, what do we do?

741
01:34:16,810 --> 01:34:17,913
Yeo-il!

742
01:34:19,242 --> 01:34:20,994
Hey, hey?

743
01:34:23,123 --> 01:34:24,467
It's hot...

744
01:34:25,277 --> 01:34:26,606
Yeo-il!

745
01:34:27,251 --> 01:34:28,659
Hot here.

746
01:34:30,997 --> 01:34:33,092
Yeo-il, Yeo-il!

747
01:34:38,599 --> 01:34:40,712
Hurts big...

748
01:34:42,886 --> 01:34:44,511
Yeo-il!

749
01:34:47,472 --> 01:34:49,680
Yeo-il!

750
01:34:52,643 --> 01:34:57,228
Yeo-il!

751
01:37:11,242 --> 01:37:13,147
Moon Sang-sa.

752
01:37:13,516 --> 01:37:15,244
- Search him.
- Yes, sir. Hold this, please.

753
01:37:17,213 --> 01:37:17,998
Stay still!

754
01:37:18,469 --> 01:37:20,485
What did you want 
in these mountains?

755
01:37:28,894 --> 01:37:30,487
What's this?

756
01:37:31,328 --> 01:37:33,280
We'll all die together...

757
01:37:34,103 --> 01:37:36,041
How's that?
Alright?

758
01:37:37,954 --> 01:37:40,882
It'll be a sight to see
if they drop it all here.

759
01:37:41,417 --> 01:37:42,761
It's just villagers here!

760
01:37:45,139 --> 01:37:46,570
Tell the truth...

761
01:37:48,762 --> 01:37:50,451
Why'd you come?

762
01:37:51,037 --> 01:37:53,188
Talk, bastard!

763
01:37:53,766 --> 01:37:56,531
Never mind asking him.
Let's just bury him alive.

764
01:37:57,363 --> 01:37:59,453
Smith, hit him again with a rock!

765
01:38:00,646 --> 01:38:03,332
Did you call him Smith?

766
01:38:04,599 --> 01:38:06,439
How the hell do you
know my name?

767
01:38:08,031 --> 01:38:09,744
Are you Smith?

768
01:38:10,369 --> 01:38:11,497
You?

769
01:38:12,441 --> 01:38:16,130
- Is that right?
- Yeah. yeah, how do you know my name?

770
01:38:29,420 --> 01:38:31,218
What's going on here?

771
01:38:38,334 --> 01:38:39,454
Hey, guys.

772
01:38:44,384 --> 01:38:45,920
I found something.

773
01:39:01,827 --> 01:39:08,662
Shouldn't this be enough
to decoy the bomb raid?

774
01:39:13,189 --> 01:39:15,311
It's not enough, but...

775
01:39:15,822 --> 01:39:18,400
If we work altogether,
it wouldn't be totally impossible

776
01:39:20,255 --> 01:39:21,800
What do you mean?

777
01:39:22,272 --> 01:39:23,897
Work together on what?

778
01:39:25,105 --> 01:39:27,145
We know what would happen here,
you can't just sit by.

779
01:39:28,881 --> 01:39:32,434
We're third parties.
Why don't we mind our business...

780
01:39:32,978 --> 01:39:34,922
and just leave the village?

781
01:39:39,090 --> 01:39:40,980
Don't give me any orders.

782
01:39:41,971 --> 01:39:43,580
We're not from the same unit.

783
01:39:44,964 --> 01:39:46,638
I'll do as I want.

784
01:39:49,892 --> 01:39:52,134
High Comrade?

785
01:39:55,135 --> 01:39:57,935
We'd just decoy the bomb attack.

786
01:39:58,688 --> 01:40:00,992
We fire some warning shots and run.

787
01:40:02,423 --> 01:40:04,088
No problem at all.

788
01:40:08,385 --> 01:40:11,576
Moon Sang-sa, you think...

789
01:40:12,682 --> 01:40:15,738
if you run away now and live,
you'll be at ease?

790
01:40:18,202 --> 01:40:21,842
You'd regret it all your life
and probably go crazy.

791
01:40:22,484 --> 01:40:24,517
I'd rather go crazy.

792
01:40:24,900 --> 01:40:29,132
You want to die like hell,
so it doesn't matter for you.

793
01:40:30,294 --> 01:40:32,726
But I'm not
interested at all!

794
01:40:40,552 --> 01:40:42,984
High Comrade

795
01:40:45,048 --> 01:40:46,687
You know how we got here.

796
01:40:48,352 --> 01:40:52,201
The wounded
and women comrades...

797
01:40:52,714 --> 01:40:55,034
I killed all those
that couldn't keep up.

798
01:40:56,874 --> 01:40:59,531
How do I face my family
back home?

799
01:41:00,140 --> 01:41:02,820
That was on orders
from Command.

800
01:41:03,237 --> 01:41:05,828
How many people did we kill
on the way here?

801
01:41:06,942 --> 01:41:09,116
We can repay that debt now.

802
01:41:13,869 --> 01:41:14,622
Moon Sang-sa.

803
01:41:15,655 --> 01:41:17,141
I'm not going!

804
01:41:18,991 --> 01:41:20,183
If my family...

805
01:41:21,670 --> 01:41:23,537
Even if it were my own family
I couldn't do it.

806
01:41:35,106 --> 01:41:37,218
What are you waiting for, guys?

807
01:41:59,022 --> 01:42:01,230
Everything's screwed up!

808
01:42:21,656 --> 01:42:23,417
This operation...

809
01:42:24,808 --> 01:42:27,001
how about Second Lieutenant Pyo
leading it?

810
01:42:32,522 --> 01:42:35,474
These damn weapons are
too new to me.

811
01:42:37,553 --> 01:42:39,493
Which, which is the front?

812
01:43:11,339 --> 01:43:17,114
Wretched offspring... Shouldn't come
if you're gonna leave.

813
01:43:17,979 --> 01:43:21,266
Blowing up all the corn...

814
01:44:02,957 --> 01:44:03,981
Look here!

815
01:44:18,074 --> 01:44:20,706
It'll be cold three or four days.

816
01:44:32,667 --> 01:44:34,917
Are you comin' back?

817
01:44:45,629 --> 01:44:49,454
Uncle Seu Miss!

818
01:46:06,202 --> 01:46:07,466
I have a favor to ask...

819
01:46:08,074 --> 01:46:10,795
Go back to your base with Smith.

820
01:46:13,339 --> 01:46:17,411
Smith, he asked me
to go back to the base with you.

821
01:46:18,900 --> 01:46:19,741
What?

822
01:46:21,069 --> 01:46:22,077
The base?

823
01:46:24,437 --> 01:46:28,565
No, I'm going
with you guys.

824
01:46:29,310 --> 01:46:30,670
We can try this once,

825
01:46:31,119 --> 01:46:33,288
but If they attack
the second time, it's over.

826
01:46:34,182 --> 01:46:36,438
Dongmakgol is in your hands.

827
01:46:37,094 --> 01:46:38,864
They'll believe you if you tell them.

828
01:46:39,705 --> 01:46:42,847
If the 2nd attack is hapenning,
there is no turning back.

829
01:46:43,731 --> 01:46:45,474
They're going to believe your word.

830
01:46:58,685 --> 01:47:02,100
I guess I don't have
much of a choice, do I?

831
01:47:08,455 --> 01:47:09,887
Take this.

832
01:47:23,305 --> 01:47:25,016
It's been good luck for me.

833
01:47:31,964 --> 01:47:36,139
Take care, guys!

834
01:47:38,700 --> 01:47:42,413
Their bombers will pass over us
at about 18:00.

835
01:47:45,774 --> 01:47:47,102
When they discover us...

836
01:47:47,927 --> 01:47:51,319
We have to expose ourselves to
look like an anti-aircraft base.

837
01:47:58,369 --> 01:48:00,152
The flight path on the map...

838
01:48:01,257 --> 01:48:04,682
says they'll come
from that area in this direction.

839
01:48:05,274 --> 01:48:07,193
Your holes should be facing
11 o'clock and...

840
01:48:08,313 --> 01:48:12,388
MG50 and MG30 should be placed
here and here.

841
01:48:13,012 --> 01:48:14,852
Next, Sergeant Jang...

842
01:48:15,733 --> 01:48:17,429
Set up the lanterns you brought...

843
01:48:18,061 --> 01:48:20,942
To light up the decoy tents to look
like a village.

844
01:48:21,765 --> 01:48:23,341
They'll believe
it's an anti-aircraft base.

845
01:48:23,869 --> 01:48:27,560
Just in case this place
doesn't get noticed...

846
01:48:29,855 --> 01:48:32,399
wire the TNT underground, too.

847
01:48:46,339 --> 01:48:49,100
No one's gonna care we did this.

848
01:48:49,979 --> 01:48:52,650
It's not too late.
Let's just leave!

849
01:48:53,172 --> 01:48:54,796
That's enough out of you little pup!

850
01:49:02,710 --> 01:49:05,470
You've got good
command capability.

851
01:49:09,038 --> 01:49:10,414
You all helped so well.

852
01:49:13,392 --> 01:49:15,583
Why'd you yield command to me?

853
01:49:24,225 --> 01:49:27,395
I'm not suited to the vanguard.

854
01:49:30,476 --> 01:49:32,588
The war started and
everyone in my unit died...

855
01:49:35,141 --> 01:49:39,158
I got a commanding rank
for surviving alone.

856
01:49:43,331 --> 01:49:45,390
You're a born leader.

857
01:49:49,127 --> 01:49:51,128
Does it look that way?

858
01:49:52,830 --> 01:49:55,215
That's good.

859
01:50:02,169 --> 01:50:03,787
Listen to me!

860
01:50:04,250 --> 01:50:06,740
How can the five of us stop
a plane in the sky?

861
01:50:13,043 --> 01:50:15,196
Everyone to their positions!
We don't have time!

862
01:50:15,923 --> 01:50:18,581
- You said there was time!
- Shut up and get moving!

863
01:50:39,314 --> 01:50:40,810
Until the bomber...

864
01:50:41,528 --> 01:50:45,866
is within shooting range
we must stay put!

865
01:50:48,620 --> 01:50:51,915
Elder brother!

866
01:50:52,364 --> 01:50:54,131
Come on over here!

867
01:50:55,935 --> 01:50:56,878
Little pup, scared?

868
01:51:02,624 --> 01:51:03,783
Stay here.

869
01:51:10,985 --> 01:51:13,755
Moon Sang-sa.

870
01:51:14,554 --> 01:51:17,035
Sing that song again
from yesterday.

871
01:51:18,362 --> 01:51:21,250
You want me to sing here, now?

872
01:51:23,205 --> 01:51:25,924
Come on, try!

873
01:51:33,055 --> 01:51:35,927
# A rolling rhythm...

874
01:51:37,879 --> 01:51:41,216
# And a sweet melody...

875
01:51:44,353 --> 01:51:47,289
# A boogie song is...

876
01:51:50,482 --> 01:51:53,866
# a song of hope.

877
01:51:55,435 --> 01:51:59,476
# Wipe away those sad tears...

878
01:52:06,636 --> 01:52:08,947
Eagle2, Report current status over.

879
01:52:09,381 --> 01:52:10,213
Roger

880
01:52:10,669 --> 01:52:13,620
We don't see any enemy movement
at the current position, over.

881
01:52:39,470 --> 01:52:40,741
By the way...

882
01:52:42,231 --> 01:52:45,983
Aren't we Allied Forces, too?

883
01:52:49,918 --> 01:52:53,854
We're a North-South Joint Force,
aren't we?

884
01:52:54,561 --> 01:52:55,816
Am I wrong?

885
01:52:56,497 --> 01:52:58,962
You can joke
at a time like this?

886
01:52:59,931 --> 01:53:01,339
That makes sense!

887
01:53:09,054 --> 01:53:11,143
Instead of like this...

888
01:53:12,255 --> 01:53:17,305
If we had met somewhere else
some other way...

889
01:53:18,442 --> 01:53:21,507
We would have had real fun.

890
01:53:22,163 --> 01:53:25,050
Don't you think so?

891
01:53:36,292 --> 01:53:37,038
It's now!

892
01:54:01,761 --> 01:54:03,770
I think that was enough.

893
01:54:04,283 --> 01:54:06,292
Yeah, that should be enough.

894
01:54:06,907 --> 01:54:08,331
Then let's run!

895
01:54:17,853 --> 01:54:21,551
Damn it, they didn't see us!

896
01:54:25,808 --> 01:54:27,272
Nest A-1, Nest A-1

897
01:54:27,785 --> 01:54:29,191
This is Sparrow05

898
01:54:29,545 --> 01:54:33,705
From our current position,
we have detected enemy movements.

899
01:54:34,199 --> 01:54:36,271
I'm on my way down.
Check it out, over.

900
01:54:45,363 --> 01:54:46,516
Gottcha

901
01:55:46,740 --> 01:55:47,460
Taek-gi!

902
01:56:44,072 --> 01:56:45,215
Moon Sang-sa!

903
01:57:59,950 --> 01:58:02,311
Hurry, come on.

904
01:58:06,832 --> 01:58:07,785
Take cover!

905
02:00:13,144 --> 02:00:14,322
Elder brother!
Elder Brother!

906
02:00:18,554 --> 02:00:19,156
Brother!

907
02:00:20,355 --> 02:00:21,147
Brother!

908
02:00:23,274 --> 02:00:24,185
Elder brother!

909
02:00:30,731 --> 02:00:32,382
Little pup!

910
02:00:35,133 --> 02:00:38,052
I'm... fine...

911
02:00:48,024 --> 02:00:48,840
Elder brother...

912
02:01:21,505 --> 02:01:22,713
You damn bastards!

913
02:01:37,907 --> 02:01:39,886
Take cover!
Take cover!

914
02:01:40,748 --> 02:01:42,143
Take cover!

915
02:02:37,164 --> 02:02:38,701
One minute to drop zone, deadline.

916
02:02:44,446 --> 02:02:48,342
Nest A-1, Nest A-1.
We are in hot zone.

917
02:02:48,830 --> 02:02:50,647
Repeat EO 1,2
and 3 are in the hot zone.

918
02:02:51,880 --> 02:02:54,256
Mission has been initiated.

919
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:57,401
One minute to engage.
