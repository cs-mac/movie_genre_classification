1
00:00:02,064 --> 00:00:04,271
And don't worry about the prompter.

2
00:00:04,433 --> 00:00:07,880
- You got a lot of lights in here, I'm just--
- Recording.

3
00:00:08,537 --> 00:00:10,676
Let's go. Okay, right down the lens.

4
00:00:10,839 --> 00:00:12,045
He was scoring--

5
00:00:12,207 --> 00:00:14,710
Tell us the story. ESPN.

6
00:00:14,877 --> 00:00:16,220
- Recording.
- Now?

7
00:00:16,378 --> 00:00:18,551
Yeah. Recording. Okay, loosen up.

8
00:00:18,714 --> 00:00:21,285
Just go for it.
Just go for it, George.

9
00:00:23,952 --> 00:00:28,196
The Los Angeles Galaxy came into
Washington today and beat DC United.

10
00:00:28,357 --> 00:00:31,099
Gotta say, whats going on
with DC United nowadays?

11
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:36,369
Danny Allsopp brought his A-game,
scoring a bicycle kick goal off the corner...

12
00:00:36,532 --> 00:00:39,035
...but he and the rest of
the black and red...

13
00:00:39,201 --> 00:00:44,275
...couldn't put a stop to a particularly
ferocious and unstoppable Galaxy attack:

14
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:48,911
Landon Donovan, the Galaxy captain
and lean, mean scoring machine.

15
00:00:49,077 --> 00:00:52,957
Landon, you went to sleep
after the World Cup for a few months...

16
00:00:53,115 --> 00:00:56,255
...but you're out of bed now
and I gotta say you go, Landon.

17
00:00:56,418 --> 00:00:59,456
Go on with your bad striker self.

18
00:00:59,621 --> 00:01:03,330
And that's it for tonight.
Back to you, Denise.

19
00:01:03,492 --> 00:01:05,267
Yes.

20
00:01:05,427 --> 00:01:08,465
Look at you, huh? How good was that?

21
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:10,632
I enjoyed that.
That was fun.

22
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,575
You enjoyed it?
I really enjoyed that, George.

23
00:01:13,735 --> 00:01:17,615
- Really, and you looked great.
- Thank you.

24
00:01:17,773 --> 00:01:21,482
So how different was that
from coaching soccer?

25
00:01:22,444 --> 00:01:24,117
That's a good question.

26
00:01:24,279 --> 00:01:27,624
I mean, looking after 13 kids
is not exactly a piece of cake.

27
00:01:27,783 --> 00:01:33,461
Well, they say the parents require
the most work. What do you think?

28
00:01:33,622 --> 00:01:38,128
I guess I would take that
on a parent-by-parent basis.

29
00:01:38,293 --> 00:01:41,934
And the moms?
A single dad like yourself...

30
00:01:42,097 --> 00:01:46,477
...do you find that a distraction
or inspiration?

31
00:01:47,302 --> 00:01:49,976
I would have to take that
on a mom-by-mom basis.

32
00:01:50,138 --> 00:01:54,143
And what about me?
Distraction or inspiration?

33
00:01:55,477 --> 00:01:59,892
Listen, it's getting late.
I gotta go pick up Lewis.

34
00:02:00,048 --> 00:02:03,655
- We should get going.
- Yeah.

35
00:02:03,819 --> 00:02:05,492
Listen to me, I gotta-- I can't.

36
00:02:05,654 --> 00:02:09,363
It's not as if I'm not leaving my family,
George.

37
00:02:09,525 --> 00:02:12,199
I'm just looking for laughs.

38
00:02:23,338 --> 00:02:27,753
We're back. Hi. Hi, sweetie.

39
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:30,823
Hey, buddy. Hey, champ.

40
00:02:30,979 --> 00:02:35,724
Sorry we ran on a little long.
You ready to go?

41
00:02:35,884 --> 00:02:38,694
Yeah, okay? All right.

42
00:02:38,854 --> 00:02:41,334
- Bye, George.
- Bye. Bye, Samantha.

43
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:44,562
Come on, it's late. Let's go.

44
00:02:46,028 --> 00:02:48,372
- Wonderful. it's 11:15, George.
- I know.

45
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:50,339
But we had fun, didn't we, champ?

46
00:02:50,499 --> 00:02:52,240
Yeah.

47
00:02:52,401 --> 00:02:56,042
Yeah,
I got that audition as a sportscaster...

48
00:02:56,204 --> 00:02:59,185
...but it was just a little bit last minute.

49
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:02,620
That's good. That's good.
I'm glad for you.

50
00:03:02,778 --> 00:03:06,055
It's all right. No one got hurt.
Everyone's home safe.

51
00:03:06,214 --> 00:03:07,921
Okay. Good night, George.

52
00:03:08,083 --> 00:03:11,895
- All right. Good night, Matt.
- Good night.

53
00:03:12,054 --> 00:03:15,433
You're gonna have to explain to me
what you saw in that guy.

54
00:03:36,979 --> 00:03:42,986
Mr. George, can you explain how you
drive a fancy car and still owe money?

55
00:03:43,151 --> 00:03:45,461
Yeah. No, I can't actually.
The thing is...

56
00:03:45,621 --> 00:03:49,592
No, there is no thing. There is only rent.
If I don't have by tomorrow--

57
00:03:49,758 --> 00:03:53,103
Shit. I'm so sorry.
Sorry, one second.

58
00:03:53,261 --> 00:03:54,968
- Hello?
- Hi, George.

59
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:58,304
-It's Pam.
- Patti, Mrs. King Patti?

60
00:03:58,467 --> 00:04:00,970
Yes, yes, George. It's Mrs. King.

61
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:03,772
Listen, can I call you back?

62
00:04:03,939 --> 00:04:08,786
You can talk to me when you get home.
I'm in your bed, George.

63
00:04:10,779 --> 00:04:12,622
I'm sorry. Where are you?

64
00:04:12,781 --> 00:04:15,921
I'm in your bed.
This is quite some room.

65
00:04:16,084 --> 00:04:20,965
It's a little Mid Eastern for my taste,
but I must say your closets are fabulous.

66
00:04:22,624 --> 00:04:24,626
Wait, wait, Patti, wait. Wait, Param!

67
00:04:24,793 --> 00:04:26,830
Don't-- Param, come here a second.

68
00:04:29,197 --> 00:04:33,942
- I don't think that you're in my bedroom.
- What?

69
00:04:34,336 --> 00:04:38,807
No, you think that you're in my bedroom,
but you're in my landlord's bedroom.

70
00:04:45,047 --> 00:04:46,526
Oh, my God.

71
00:04:47,482 --> 00:04:50,656
- Where are you?
- In the guest house across the driveway.

72
00:04:52,554 --> 00:04:56,229
Patti, just get out of there now, okay?

73
00:04:56,391 --> 00:04:58,496
Mr. George.

74
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:07,245
Param? Okay, yeah.

75
00:05:07,402 --> 00:05:12,181
I'm sorry I didn't sort you out before,
but I forgot I left the cash in my Ferrari.

76
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:14,183
- So how much is it?
-900.

77
00:05:14,342 --> 00:05:17,016
-900? Cash is good, yeah?
- Yeah.

78
00:05:17,179 --> 00:05:20,717
That's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6--

79
00:05:20,882 --> 00:05:23,988
- It's a beautiful night, huh? 7, 8.
- Yeah.

80
00:05:24,152 --> 00:05:25,859
- How much did you say?
-900.

81
00:05:26,021 --> 00:05:28,194
9-- 900. There you go.

82
00:05:28,356 --> 00:05:29,926
All right, buddy.

83
00:05:30,092 --> 00:05:35,201
I'll probably see you around,
maybe tomorrow or something.

84
00:05:41,903 --> 00:05:44,850
- Okay, no, no, no. Out.
- In.

85
00:05:45,006 --> 00:05:47,350
- You know that I can't do this.
- Oh, stop it.

86
00:05:47,509 --> 00:05:51,047
He lent you his Ferrari.
He's more possessive of that than of me.

87
00:05:51,213 --> 00:05:55,127
Whatever it is you got going on with
your husband, I want you to know...

88
00:05:55,851 --> 00:05:57,421
...I consider him a friend.

89
00:05:57,586 --> 00:06:02,626
I need you to put your clothes back on
and just leave.

90
00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:06,637
- You're gonna tell him, aren't you?
- No. God, no. I'm not gonna tell him.

91
00:06:07,429 --> 00:06:13,038
Okay, if you go now, just go home,
there's nothing to tell.

92
00:06:13,201 --> 00:06:16,944
- Mrs. King, you're not moving.
- I'm starting to feel a bit foolish.

93
00:06:17,105 --> 00:06:20,609
Oh, no, no. No reason to feel foolish.
Just go.

94
00:06:20,776 --> 00:06:24,383
You have no idea what he might do.
He's very vindictive, George.

95
00:06:24,546 --> 00:06:26,787
That's the point I'm trying to make here.

96
00:06:26,948 --> 00:06:32,728
He's gonna ask me where I was
and I'm not a very good liar.

97
00:06:32,888 --> 00:06:35,596
I think I just need one drink.

98
00:06:37,392 --> 00:06:38,427
Okay. One drink.

99
00:06:45,267 --> 00:06:46,940
There you go.

100
00:06:47,102 --> 00:06:50,811
Well, aren't you gonna have one?

101
00:06:50,972 --> 00:06:52,576
Just leave.

102
00:07:02,851 --> 00:07:05,263
I need to use the bathroom.

103
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,497
You don't know how many times
he's cheated on me.

104
00:07:14,663 --> 00:07:17,166
And I can't even do unfaithful right.

105
00:07:17,332 --> 00:07:22,008
Mrs. King? You are a smart...

106
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:26,312
...a strong, beautiful woman.

107
00:07:26,474 --> 00:07:30,616
And I personally think...

108
00:07:30,779 --> 00:07:35,057
...that you shouldn't stay in a marriage
that you're not happy in.

109
00:07:38,987 --> 00:07:41,558
Oh, shit. That's probably Carl.

110
00:07:41,723 --> 00:07:44,329
What? Carl knows you're here?

111
00:07:44,492 --> 00:07:47,473
- Yeah. Sometimes he has me followed.
- What?

112
00:07:47,629 --> 00:07:49,302
He thinks I might cheat on him.

113
00:07:49,464 --> 00:07:53,708
Okay, okay. Stay in there, okay?
And don't come out.

114
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:10,752
Par-am'?
Mr. George"...

115
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:13,195
...you gave me an extra hundred.

116
00:08:14,356 --> 00:08:17,166
Yeah, thanks.

117
00:08:21,763 --> 00:08:26,678
Mr. George, how do you meet
all these beautiful women?

118
00:08:26,835 --> 00:08:28,872
Well, maybe it's the accent.

119
00:08:31,573 --> 00:08:33,883
I have an accent too.

120
00:08:37,846 --> 00:08:41,419
- George. George, I was looking for you.
- Oh, hey, how's it going?

121
00:08:41,583 --> 00:08:45,895
Well, it turns out I'm not the only person
who thought you had style.

122
00:08:46,054 --> 00:08:49,797
My old station manager edited your tape.
He's gonna send it to Bristol.

123
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:51,562
He thinks you have a shot.

124
00:08:51,726 --> 00:08:53,433
- Wait, you serious?
- I'm serious.

125
00:08:53,595 --> 00:08:55,233
- Bristol, Connecticut?
- Yeah.

126
00:08:55,397 --> 00:08:59,607
- Just don't forget the girl who said it first.
- No, no, I won't.

127
00:09:00,635 --> 00:09:01,978
Oh, George?

128
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:09,382
When you're out there today
and you see me tug my ear like this.

129
00:09:10,545 --> 00:09:12,923
That means I'm imagining you
on top of me.

130
00:09:13,214 --> 00:09:15,251
ORE?
ORE?

131
00:09:15,417 --> 00:09:17,920
Well, I better get back to the game,
all right'?

132
00:09:18,086 --> 00:09:20,760
- Well, you have a great game.
- Okay.

133
00:09:39,174 --> 00:09:42,280
Hey. Hey, what's going on?

134
00:09:42,444 --> 00:09:44,651
- What's going on? You all right?
- Nothing.

135
00:09:44,813 --> 00:09:47,123
All right, Lewis. Here, your bag.

136
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:50,129
Move forward, Scott.

137
00:09:50,285 --> 00:09:52,492
- Yeah, take it in.
- Come on, Cyclones.

138
00:09:52,654 --> 00:09:58,969
Use the mind, use the wing.
Nice one. Watch your man.

139
00:09:59,127 --> 00:10:02,665
Nice play, Lewis. There you go.

140
00:10:09,037 --> 00:10:11,039
- Hey, hey.
- Hi, coach, it's me.

141
00:10:11,206 --> 00:10:12,276
I'm kind of busy.

142
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:15,387
I'd say everything's great
except for this silly grin...

143
00:10:15,543 --> 00:10:19,389
...I can't seem to get off of my face
since the other night.

144
00:10:19,547 --> 00:10:21,185
Listen, I can't really talk.

145
00:10:21,349 --> 00:10:25,161
I hope that it's not awkward between us.
We're both adults, single.

146
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,061
And if it happens, great.

147
00:10:27,222 --> 00:10:30,692
If not ifs really only what's best
for the kids, right?

148
00:10:33,561 --> 00:10:38,010
I'm a little busy right now,
but, I mean, we could...

149
00:10:38,166 --> 00:10:40,806
- It was Lewis!
- Yes!

150
00:10:41,503 --> 00:10:42,914
Well done, kiddo.

151
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:46,848
Lewis, well done, champ.
Well done.

152
00:10:47,008 --> 00:10:49,352
- That was great.
- Didn't even see it!

153
00:10:52,514 --> 00:10:56,519
All right, come on, Cyclones.
Let's go, let's get another one.

154
00:11:01,222 --> 00:11:02,394
All right, come on.

155
00:11:03,358 --> 00:11:04,666
Let's get another one.

156
00:11:05,193 --> 00:11:07,400
Come on, Cyclones.

157
00:11:09,898 --> 00:11:11,400
Nine.

158
00:11:16,538 --> 00:11:20,042
What the hell was that?
What are you playing at?

159
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:21,585
What the hell was that?

160
00:11:22,177 --> 00:11:24,248
Is this about last night?

161
00:11:26,214 --> 00:11:28,216
- What's the matter?
- Leave me alone!

162
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:31,728
I hate soccer, and I hate you!

163
00:11:50,238 --> 00:11:52,081
- Hello'?
- He doesn't hate me, right?

164
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,618
No, of course he doesn't hate you.

165
00:11:54,776 --> 00:11:58,314
But he does want to quit the team,
George. Do you know that?

166
00:11:59,147 --> 00:12:02,993
You know, I'm a bit lost at sea here,
Stace.

167
00:12:03,151 --> 00:12:06,428
I was thinking maybe you could
give me some parenting tips.

168
00:12:06,588 --> 00:12:07,896
Basic dos and don'ts.

169
00:12:08,056 --> 00:12:11,560
Don't let your 10-year-old son
drive a Ferrari, that kind of thing?

170
00:12:11,726 --> 00:12:15,401
- My son has a big mouth, you know.
- Honest. He gets that from me.

171
00:12:15,563 --> 00:12:18,009
I'm serious.
Can we meet for a drink maybe?

172
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:21,306
No. Absolutely not.
We can meet for coffee, though.

173
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:24,079
- Dinner.
- Lunch.

174
00:12:24,239 --> 00:12:25,616
- Early dinner.
- Late lunch.

175
00:12:25,773 --> 00:12:29,619
- I'm not budging on dinner.
- I'm not the one asking for advice.

176
00:12:29,777 --> 00:12:31,188
Are you sure, no beer?

177
00:12:32,647 --> 00:12:38,791
Well, so I read about this place online.
The true Virginia experience, it says.

178
00:12:38,953 --> 00:12:43,629
Apparently, you have to really like,
you know, beat the stuffing out of it...

179
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:45,998
...you know, to get to the good stuff.

180
00:12:47,428 --> 00:12:50,500
All right, okay, you get it. Good?

181
00:12:50,665 --> 00:12:54,203
According to the Internet,
there's a real kick to the seasoning.

182
00:12:54,369 --> 00:12:57,373
I don't know,
maybe the Internet was wrong.

183
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,013
Oh, here, here.

184
00:13:01,176 --> 00:13:07,127
Oh, yeah. Okay.
Waitress, two beers, please.

185
00:13:08,783 --> 00:13:10,160
Three more beers, please.

186
00:13:11,152 --> 00:13:16,124
So I fall down the stairs, I stubbed my toe,
and I scream, "Shit."

187
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:17,964
And then the next five days...

188
00:13:18,126 --> 00:13:21,699
...Lewis is going around the house
going, "Shit, shit, shit."

189
00:13:22,564 --> 00:13:23,634
I get it. Okay.

190
00:13:23,798 --> 00:13:27,371
Even when it's hard, even when
you want to be anywhere but there...

191
00:13:27,535 --> 00:13:32,314
...even when you feel like he doesn't
need you, trust me, he does.

192
00:13:33,341 --> 00:13:34,547
Here.

193
00:13:34,709 --> 00:13:35,813
What? Where?

194
00:13:35,977 --> 00:13:38,218
- You have some crab on your cheek.
- Crap?

195
00:13:38,379 --> 00:13:40,985
- Crab. Crab, on your cheek.
- Crab. Okay.

196
00:13:41,149 --> 00:13:43,493
- Crab lips.
- Gross.

197
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:51,602
You're the only woman I ever really loved.

198
00:13:52,493 --> 00:13:55,770
- Stop it.
- No, I'm serious. I'm serious.

199
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:58,103
You know what I miss the most?

200
00:13:58,266 --> 00:14:03,045
In the early years, when I used to play
and you were in the stands watching me.

201
00:14:03,204 --> 00:14:07,209
After every game, I would look for you
and I would wave to you. Remember?

202
00:14:07,775 --> 00:14:13,020
And no matter how badly I played
how massively I screwed up...

203
00:14:13,181 --> 00:14:17,721
...I always knew when you waved
back at me, everything would be all right.

204
00:14:17,885 --> 00:14:23,096
I mean, I felt like the most special person
in the world when you did that.

205
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:28,907
Until I'd look behind and six other women
were all waving back along with me.

206
00:14:29,063 --> 00:14:31,566
I was young then.
You know, I'm different now.

207
00:14:31,733 --> 00:14:34,373
Okay, so prove that to Lewis.

208
00:14:34,535 --> 00:14:37,482
- He hates me, remember?
- He doesn't hate you.

209
00:14:37,639 --> 00:14:41,587
He just hates being disappointed,
and you've done that a lot, okay?

210
00:14:41,743 --> 00:14:45,122
I mean, he was 4 when you left,
remember?

211
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,453
You weren't even there before that.

212
00:14:47,615 --> 00:14:52,587
It was easier when you were an absentee
daddy sending gifts, but now you're here.

213
00:14:52,754 --> 00:14:56,292
And I'm sorry
if you take offense to this...

214
00:14:56,457 --> 00:14:59,165
...but you're a time bomb
with a charming accent...

215
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:02,934
...and when you explode, it's like:

216
00:15:03,097 --> 00:15:04,974
You know, boom. Chaos.

217
00:15:07,135 --> 00:15:10,309
I hope you came back for him.
I really do.

218
00:15:10,471 --> 00:15:13,577
Nothing would make me happier.

219
00:15:14,442 --> 00:15:16,444
But if you came back for me...

220
00:15:16,611 --> 00:15:20,753
...you're wasting our time, and you're
gonna break his heart in the process.

221
00:15:28,022 --> 00:15:30,525
- I gotta go.
- All right.

222
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:33,705
Hey, thanks for lunch.

223
00:15:56,684 --> 00:15:58,027
Hey, kiddo.

224
00:16:08,996 --> 00:16:12,842
So your mom was saying you were
thinking of quitting the team.

225
00:16:14,202 --> 00:16:19,379
I just want to say, I think that would be...
I think that would be a big mistake.

226
00:16:20,007 --> 00:16:22,886
What's the point? I'm not good anyway.

227
00:16:23,044 --> 00:16:24,990
No, see, I don't agree with that.

228
00:16:25,146 --> 00:16:27,592
You may have your mom's looks
and her smarts...

229
00:16:27,749 --> 00:16:30,923
...but you're a Dryer kid
and you play soccer.

230
00:16:31,085 --> 00:16:32,564
It's in your blood.

231
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,564
I was thinking maybe we'd go
down to the park now...

232
00:16:35,723 --> 00:16:39,102
...and gel a practice session in
before the big game.

233
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:40,534
What do you say?

234
00:16:45,867 --> 00:16:47,073
Okay.

235
00:16:49,036 --> 00:16:51,209
Dad, ifs raining.

236
00:16:51,372 --> 00:16:55,081
It's just a sprinkle.
It'll be over before you know it.

237
00:16:55,243 --> 00:16:58,713
-It's just typical.
- What do you mean, "typical"?

238
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,882
Nothing ever works out for our family.

239
00:17:01,048 --> 00:17:04,723
What are you talking about?
Plenty of stuff works out.

240
00:17:04,886 --> 00:17:07,560
This is the best time
to learn how to play soccer.

241
00:17:07,722 --> 00:17:10,032
Because in the rain, like this...

242
00:17:10,191 --> 00:17:13,729
...if you can play in this,
you can play in anything, right?

243
00:17:16,297 --> 00:17:18,106
There you go.

244
00:17:30,912 --> 00:17:33,290
Don't worry, Stace,
I'm sure they'll be fine.

245
00:17:34,615 --> 00:17:36,993
I'm just gonna see if they're all right.

246
00:17:37,151 --> 00:17:40,758
- Do you want me to come? I can drive.
- No. I'm fine.

247
00:17:44,826 --> 00:17:47,329
All right, one, two.

248
00:17:47,495 --> 00:17:51,568
And you're gonna do this one now.
Like this.

249
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:53,941
- Okay.
- Okay? There you go.

250
00:17:54,101 --> 00:17:55,341
That's it.

251
00:18:26,634 --> 00:18:29,376
I think I finally got all of that mud
out of my ear.

252
00:18:29,537 --> 00:18:31,312
What about you?

253
00:18:32,473 --> 00:18:33,975
Lewis?

254
00:18:42,683 --> 00:18:44,822
You had a big day.

255
00:18:44,986 --> 00:18:47,057
- Another good result, buddy, huh?
- Yeah.

256
00:18:47,221 --> 00:18:49,223
A great goal coming in from the left.

257
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:50,460
He?
He?'

258
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:51,660
How was the game?

259
00:18:51,826 --> 00:18:53,567
- Mom, I scored a goal.
- You did?

260
00:18:53,728 --> 00:18:56,038
- We won again.
- Nice work, kiddo.

261
00:18:56,197 --> 00:18:59,007
- How was last night?
- Yeah, it was really good.

262
00:19:00,001 --> 00:19:01,207
- Good.
- Hey, Dad?

263
00:19:01,369 --> 00:19:04,350
Me and Mom are going to the arcade
today. Wanna come?

264
00:19:04,505 --> 00:19:08,043
- No, I'm gonna let you guys go on with it.
- Mom, can he come?

265
00:19:09,343 --> 00:19:12,256
Well, yeah, I mean,
you're welcome to come if you want.

266
00:19:14,515 --> 00:19:15,550
Okay.

267
00:19:19,353 --> 00:19:21,526
Yeah! Yeah!

268
00:19:21,689 --> 00:19:24,693
- You're playing like a baby.
- You're hitting like a girl.

269
00:19:24,859 --> 00:19:26,202
Young Dryer.

270
00:19:30,498 --> 00:19:33,707
Two shots? Accident.
Let's get rid of him.

271
00:19:35,202 --> 00:19:36,772
Oh, yes!

272
00:19:38,205 --> 00:19:41,948
Hey, Mom, did you know that Dad
once took the ball off of Beckham?

273
00:19:42,109 --> 00:19:44,589
Oh, yeah, I know, actually.
I was there.

274
00:19:45,212 --> 00:19:47,624
I wanna play like Beckham.

275
00:19:48,282 --> 00:19:50,853
Hey.
What, you don't want to play like me?

276
00:19:51,018 --> 00:19:52,622
Yes!

277
00:19:53,754 --> 00:19:56,564
God, it seems like so long ago,
doesn't it?

278
00:19:56,724 --> 00:19:58,397
Yeah.

279
00:20:01,028 --> 00:20:06,137
So the big day's coming up, huh?

280
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:08,974
Yeah. Yeah.

281
00:20:09,136 --> 00:20:11,980
- Are you excited?
- Yeah. Yeah, of course I am.

282
00:20:13,074 --> 00:20:15,714
It's just crazy.

283
00:20:15,876 --> 00:20:18,755
I just never thought
I'd be doing this again.

284
00:20:20,948 --> 00:20:23,428
Stacie's getting married.

285
00:20:30,224 --> 00:20:31,931
- Hey, Dad?
- Yeah?

286
00:20:32,093 --> 00:20:34,835
Can I have a sleepover
at your house again tonight?

287
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:39,270
It's not my night, buddy.
It's your mom's.

288
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:46,777
Yeah. Sure. Fine with me.

289
00:20:46,941 --> 00:20:49,285
You wanna see my room?

290
00:20:51,312 --> 00:20:54,589
Yeah.
Yeah, of course I want to see your room.

291
00:20:59,153 --> 00:21:01,861
It's not as big as my room at home,
but I like it.

292
00:21:02,023 --> 00:21:05,334
Yeah.
It is way cooler than I thought.

293
00:21:05,493 --> 00:21:07,871
You know that's me, Mom.

294
00:21:08,029 --> 00:21:10,771
Yeah, I know that's you.

295
00:21:10,931 --> 00:21:12,706
- You see this?
- That? Who's that?

296
00:21:12,867 --> 00:21:14,471
- You.
- Me?

297
00:21:14,635 --> 00:21:15,978
- And me.
- You.

298
00:21:16,137 --> 00:21:17,309
Dad.

299
00:21:17,471 --> 00:21:20,213
And Dad, huh? You, me, and Dad.

300
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:33,488
- He okay?
- Yeah. Fast asleep.

301
00:21:36,824 --> 00:21:39,168
Some wine?

302
00:21:39,326 --> 00:21:42,535
Oh, no, no.
I should probably get going.

303
00:21:44,565 --> 00:21:47,876
- Fun day though, huh?
- Yeah. Yeah.

304
00:21:49,904 --> 00:21:52,214
So who gets the teddy bear?

305
00:21:58,746 --> 00:22:01,056
Does he make you laugh, Stace?

306
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:05,057
Like really make you laugh?

307
00:22:07,922 --> 00:22:09,526
Yeah.

308
00:22:14,428 --> 00:22:16,874
It's so weird...

309
00:22:17,031 --> 00:22:19,272
...but sometimes I just...

310
00:22:20,434 --> 00:22:25,884
I look at you and it feels like
nothing ever changed.

311
00:22:27,108 --> 00:22:29,281
Like we're still together.

312
00:22:33,714 --> 00:22:36,285
I look at your face, and I--

313
00:22:37,251 --> 00:22:40,858
I realize how lucky I was
to ever have you.

314
00:22:41,021 --> 00:22:45,595
And it kills me that I can't just
reach out and talk to you anymore.

315
00:23:11,585 --> 00:23:15,795
L-- I can't. I can't do this.

316
00:23:21,962 --> 00:23:26,274
Stacie. Stacie, hold on a second.

317
00:23:26,901 --> 00:23:29,939
Hey, hey. Stacie.

318
00:23:35,509 --> 00:23:37,511
You don't have to go.

319
00:24:16,483 --> 00:24:19,987
- Hey.
- Hey, I thought you'd be home later.

320
00:24:20,154 --> 00:24:23,192
No, I grabbed an earlier flight.
Where were you?

321
00:24:23,357 --> 00:24:25,803
I was just dropping Lewis off at his dad's.

322
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,997
Oh, it's not his night, is it?

323
00:24:28,162 --> 00:24:32,542
No. But he wanted to go,
and I thought it was fine.

324
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:33,735
Who's that?

325
00:24:33,901 --> 00:24:35,744
My mom. Last-minute invites.

326
00:24:35,903 --> 00:24:39,009
Hey, hey, hey. You okay?

327
00:24:39,173 --> 00:24:41,016
- I'm fine.
- You are?

328
00:24:41,175 --> 00:24:42,381
You hungry?

329
00:24:57,524 --> 00:24:59,026
Hey, Denise. What's up?

330
00:24:59,193 --> 00:25:02,197
I am. So you want some good news?

331
00:25:02,363 --> 00:25:04,536
I could certainly
do with some right now.

332
00:25:04,698 --> 00:25:09,044
Okay, good news coming at you
in three, two...

333
00:25:16,043 --> 00:25:18,284
- I like the look, George.
- Yeah?

334
00:25:20,014 --> 00:25:22,517
So, what did you want to tell me?

335
00:25:22,683 --> 00:25:24,253
Well, you gonna some closer?

336
00:25:24,418 --> 00:25:28,127
No, no, no. The last time I came closer
I got myself in trouble.

337
00:25:28,289 --> 00:25:30,291
Which was just fine.

338
00:25:36,130 --> 00:25:37,973
ESPN liked your tape.

339
00:25:40,601 --> 00:25:42,103
They did?

340
00:25:42,269 --> 00:25:43,407
Liked as in liked?

341
00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:46,312
They want to fly you up there
to see you personally.

342
00:25:46,473 --> 00:25:48,953
ESPN? ESP-bloody-N?

343
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:55,321
- You did it, George.
- That's amazing.

344
00:25:55,482 --> 00:25:57,928
You're on your way.

345
00:25:58,085 --> 00:26:00,395
Thank you so much.

346
00:26:03,791 --> 00:26:07,762
All right. Okay, okay.

347
00:26:07,928 --> 00:26:12,968
I gotta get--
I gotta get back inside.

348
00:26:14,501 --> 00:26:18,506
So that's all I get? That's it?

349
00:26:18,672 --> 00:26:22,848
I help you out,
you just leave me hanging?

350
00:26:23,944 --> 00:26:26,015
I just can't.

351
00:26:27,915 --> 00:26:31,761
I just can't do this anymore.

352
00:26:33,153 --> 00:26:34,461
I gotta grow up.

353
00:26:34,621 --> 00:26:38,467
I got a boy in there
who needs me to start being a father.

354
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:41,796
Well...

355
00:26:42,997 --> 00:26:46,137
...you have no idea
what you're missing.

356
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:49,042
I think I do,
which is why I gotta go back inside.

357
00:26:49,203 --> 00:26:50,807
All right.

358
00:26:54,274 --> 00:26:55,844
That's it?

359
00:27:07,621 --> 00:27:09,362
Lewis?

360
00:27:13,394 --> 00:27:15,135
Hey, buddy.

361
00:27:16,563 --> 00:27:18,008
Hey.

362
00:27:18,999 --> 00:27:20,501
You Okay?

363
00:27:21,068 --> 00:27:23,412
Hey, what's the matter?

364
00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:26,312
- You having a bad dream?
- No.

365
00:27:26,473 --> 00:27:28,510
I just want to sleep in here.

366
00:27:28,675 --> 00:27:30,177
Yeah?

367
00:27:31,011 --> 00:27:32,046
Okay.

368
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:36,222
- Dad?
- Yeah?

369
00:27:36,383 --> 00:27:38,056
I love you.

370
00:27:39,219 --> 00:27:41,096
Come here.

371
00:27:42,556 --> 00:27:44,763
Please don't leave again.

372
00:28:14,121 --> 00:28:15,930
- Mr. Dryer?
- Yeah, I'm George.

373
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:18,730
I'm Ellen. I work with Mr. Minion.
You ready?

374
00:28:18,892 --> 00:28:19,927
Yeah, I'm ready.

375
00:28:20,094 --> 00:28:22,973
All right.
They're waiting for you in the studio.

376
00:28:24,264 --> 00:28:26,904
- Right this way.
- Okay.

377
00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:34,648
- Hey. George Dryer. How's it going?
- Good, nice to meet you.

378
00:28:34,808 --> 00:28:37,652
I heard you were coming.
I know you're gonna kill it.

379
00:28:37,811 --> 00:28:39,586
Get out there and make it happen.

380
00:28:39,746 --> 00:28:42,090
Thank you, buddy.
I appreciate it.

381
00:28:42,249 --> 00:28:45,492
In Group E, Cameroon went down
2-1 to the Netherlands.

382
00:28:45,652 --> 00:28:50,624
The Dutch team are appearing as strong
contenders, taking 9 points out of 9...

383
00:28:50,791 --> 00:28:53,931
...and moving on past the group phase
to face Slovakia.

384
00:28:54,328 --> 00:28:57,138
Not moving on are the French...

385
00:28:59,133 --> 00:29:00,806
The French.

386
00:29:01,268 --> 00:29:02,941
What happened to the French?

387
00:29:03,103 --> 00:29:07,848
They came, they saw, they bitched,
they fought, half the management quit.

388
00:29:08,008 --> 00:29:11,251
The rest of the team went on strike,
lost, and went home.

389
00:29:11,411 --> 00:29:15,291
I may be giving the French a hard time,
but it does lead to a point.

390
00:29:15,449 --> 00:29:19,591
Now I've been honored and lucky enough
to play for both club and country...

391
00:29:19,753 --> 00:29:22,632
...and I can tell you
that to stand on a field...

392
00:29:22,789 --> 00:29:26,362
...and score a goal in front of
50-, 70-, 100,000 fans...

393
00:29:26,527 --> 00:29:31,135
...to feel the ground shake beneath you.
It's unbeatable.

394
00:29:31,298 --> 00:29:35,144
And whether you're on that field
or whether you're part of that crowd...

395
00:29:35,302 --> 00:29:38,977
...there's no feeling like it,
and that to me is soccer.

396
00:29:39,139 --> 00:29:42,052
George Dryer...

397
00:29:42,209 --> 00:29:43,552
...welcome to ESPN.

398
00:29:57,558 --> 00:29:59,231
- Hello?
- Oh, hey, Matt.

399
00:29:59,393 --> 00:30:01,634
I was looking for Stacie. Is she there?

400
00:30:01,795 --> 00:30:06,676
Oh, hey, George. No, she's actually--
Went to get fitted for her wedding dress.

401
00:30:08,235 --> 00:30:12,047
Okay, buddy. Thanks.

402
00:30:30,657 --> 00:30:34,730
- Hi, can I help you?
- No, I'm okay. I'll just be a minute.

403
00:30:40,734 --> 00:30:42,509
Hi.

404
00:30:42,669 --> 00:30:45,377
- What are you doing here?
- I'm sorry. It's not cool.

405
00:30:45,539 --> 00:30:47,917
It's not.
You can't come in here like this-

406
00:30:48,075 --> 00:30:51,522
I know, I know. Stacie, the timing's
always off with me. I mean--

407
00:30:51,678 --> 00:30:55,091
-ls everything okay?
- Yeah. it's fine. Just give us a minute.

408
00:30:58,018 --> 00:31:01,522
I'm either too early, or I'm too late.
That's why I came.

409
00:31:01,688 --> 00:31:04,396
In a couple of weeks,
I'm gonna be too late again.

410
00:31:04,558 --> 00:31:06,560
Stop, George, stop.

411
00:31:08,061 --> 00:31:10,302
Why are you doing this to me?

412
00:31:12,366 --> 00:31:16,473
I'm moving to Connecticut.
I got that job.

413
00:31:19,706 --> 00:31:22,312
- You got the job?
- I did, yeah.

414
00:31:24,411 --> 00:31:30,384
You know, and they gave me this book
on things to do in Connecticut.

415
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:35,624
And I'm looking at the chapter
on family life and parks and schools...

416
00:31:35,789 --> 00:31:38,599
...and I'm thinking, what's the point?

417
00:31:38,759 --> 00:31:44,300
What is the point if I don't have my family
with me, if I don't have you with me?

418
00:31:48,969 --> 00:31:50,778
Stacie...

419
00:31:51,672 --> 00:31:54,619
...I want you and Lewis to come with me.

420
00:31:56,443 --> 00:31:57,478
No.

421
00:31:57,644 --> 00:32:01,649
I can't just pick up and go to Connecticut.
I can't, not with a 9-year-old.

422
00:32:01,815 --> 00:32:04,523
- Yes, you can. Yes, you can.
- No. No.

423
00:32:04,685 --> 00:32:10,431
I know that I haven't given you
any good reason to trust me.

424
00:32:11,158 --> 00:32:14,162
But I swear to God
everything's gonna be all right.

425
00:32:15,329 --> 00:32:17,809
I'm gonna make a life for us there.

426
00:32:20,367 --> 00:32:22,813
God, I love you so much.

427
00:32:22,969 --> 00:32:25,711
Oh, George, if you love me...

428
00:32:27,507 --> 00:32:29,384
...let me go.

429
00:32:30,444 --> 00:32:32,446
Let me go.

430
00:32:56,837 --> 00:32:57,975
Excuse me?

431
00:32:58,138 --> 00:33:01,051
I think the lady's waiting for you outside.

432
00:33:31,405 --> 00:33:34,909
Oh, damn you, George.

433
00:33:35,075 --> 00:33:40,753
I know. I know, I know.
I meant everything I said.

434
00:33:47,554 --> 00:33:48,931
Please, don't touch me.

435
00:33:49,089 --> 00:33:51,968
Please don't.
If I want to be touched, I'll tell you.

436
00:33:52,125 --> 00:33:53,536
Okay, my hands are here.

437
00:33:53,693 --> 00:33:56,401
This is on my pace.
This cannot be on your pace.

438
00:33:56,563 --> 00:33:58,634
- Okay, this is not all about you.
- Okay.

439
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:00,904
Okay. On your pace.
Whatever you say.

440
00:34:01,067 --> 00:34:03,047
ORE?
ORE?

441
00:34:04,104 --> 00:34:07,313
Why couldn't you have just come back
two months later?

442
00:34:08,308 --> 00:34:10,948
Because my timing's always bad.
You know that.

443
00:34:38,405 --> 00:34:40,476
That's a couple that can really talk.

444
00:34:42,576 --> 00:34:46,285
I really don't think he's the groom.

445
00:34:48,281 --> 00:34:50,283
- Hello?
- Hey.

446
00:34:50,450 --> 00:34:52,157
Mom, we should've left already.

447
00:34:52,319 --> 00:34:54,799
I know, I know. I'm sorry.
Two minutes, okay?

448
00:34:54,955 --> 00:34:57,128
- Hi.
- Hey.

449
00:34:57,290 --> 00:34:59,793
Buddy, let's go get your bag
and get ready.

450
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:02,440
We should probably
have been there already.

451
00:35:02,596 --> 00:35:06,305
I know. I know. Sorry. Okay.

452
00:35:06,466 --> 00:35:10,778
- So do we have a wedding dress?
- It zips. That's as much as I can tell you.

453
00:35:10,937 --> 00:35:13,144
A bride to soccer mom in two seconds.

454
00:35:13,306 --> 00:35:15,786
All right, beautiful.

455
00:35:23,383 --> 00:35:26,626
Hey, coach.
Looks like we have a friend in common.

456
00:35:26,786 --> 00:35:29,062
It's the accent.

457
00:35:33,827 --> 00:35:36,171
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey, champ.

458
00:35:37,697 --> 00:35:39,335
- You doing all right?
- Yeah.

459
00:35:39,499 --> 00:35:43,003
I looked up my horoscope,
and it said “You're gonna be victorious."

460
00:35:43,169 --> 00:35:45,046
Well, we should be okay, huh?

461
00:35:45,205 --> 00:35:47,583
- Hey, coach.
- Hey. Hi, everybody.

462
00:35:47,741 --> 00:35:49,687
Hi. Hi, everybody.

463
00:35:50,410 --> 00:35:52,856
Hey, coach.
Let's get the show on the road.

464
00:35:54,381 --> 00:35:57,851
Okay, so it's the final game
of the season, okay?

465
00:35:58,018 --> 00:36:01,522
- If we win this, we win the championship.
- Yeah.

466
00:36:01,688 --> 00:36:04,100
Yeah?
And no matter what happens today...

467
00:36:04,257 --> 00:36:06,737
...I want you to know
you've made me proud.

468
00:36:06,893 --> 00:36:09,931
But we're gonna get out there
and win this game, yeah?

469
00:36:10,096 --> 00:36:11,666
Yeah!

470
00:36:11,831 --> 00:36:15,005
Let's give it everything we've got
and get these wankers.

471
00:36:15,168 --> 00:36:16,203
Yeah!

472
00:36:16,369 --> 00:36:18,076
One, two, three...

473
00:36:18,238 --> 00:36:19,683
Go, Cyclones!

474
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:21,284
Yeah!

475
00:36:33,086 --> 00:36:35,032
Well done, Ally.

476
00:36:39,059 --> 00:36:41,369
Cyclones. Cyclones. Cyclones.

477
00:36:45,298 --> 00:36:46,641
Yeah!

478
00:36:51,137 --> 00:36:53,208
Good job, Hunter.

479
00:36:54,608 --> 00:36:57,282
Don't let them play like this.

480
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:02,992
- Don't worry about it.
- Now we got a game on.

481
00:37:03,149 --> 00:37:04,560
Now we can concentrate.

482
00:37:04,718 --> 00:37:07,221
All right, let's go. Keep it together.

483
00:37:07,387 --> 00:37:10,891
Go, go, go. Don't let them--

484
00:37:11,057 --> 00:37:12,127
Okay, not a problem.

485
00:37:12,292 --> 00:37:14,431
Let's move it forward.
Close them down.

486
00:37:14,594 --> 00:37:17,438
Samantha, let's see some playing,
okay?

487
00:37:17,597 --> 00:37:20,942
Just keep pushing forward.

488
00:37:23,103 --> 00:37:26,141
Come on, guys.
Let's talk to each other.

489
00:37:26,306 --> 00:37:27,910
Lewis, make a difference.

490
00:37:28,808 --> 00:37:30,651
Push it down the line.

491
00:37:31,277 --> 00:37:33,985
Go, Lewis. Take the shot.

492
00:37:36,916 --> 00:37:43,197
Come on, Lewis.
That's it, go ahead, take it to the goal.

493
00:37:43,356 --> 00:37:44,926
There you go, Lewis.

494
00:37:46,793 --> 00:37:48,830
Go, Lewis!

495
00:37:49,963 --> 00:37:53,001
Yes. Yes, Lewis.

496
00:37:54,367 --> 00:37:55,846
Yes!

497
00:38:01,174 --> 00:38:03,711
Cyclones. Cyclones. Cyclones.

498
00:38:21,061 --> 00:38:24,975
Two minutes, Cyclones.
Let's finish this off.

499
00:38:25,131 --> 00:38:28,169
Hey, Carl.
I was wondering where you got to.

500
00:38:28,334 --> 00:38:31,543
Let's push forward, Cyclones.
Come on.

501
00:38:33,473 --> 00:38:35,578
Hey, I got a little gift for you.

502
00:38:35,742 --> 00:38:39,189
- Postcards from a great season.
- That's thoughtful. Thank you.

503
00:38:39,345 --> 00:38:41,985
- Open it up. Take a look.
- No, after the game.

504
00:38:42,148 --> 00:38:44,685
Why don't you look at it now, George?

505
00:38:45,719 --> 00:38:47,892
Come on, folks. One minute left.

506
00:38:51,524 --> 00:38:55,529
Now that is my divorce attorney's
favorite.

507
00:38:56,563 --> 00:39:01,171
George, I thought I had mentioned
that I hire people to keep tabs on Patti.

508
00:39:01,334 --> 00:39:04,872
- That slipped your mind?
- Buddy, you know what, I may be a shit.

509
00:39:05,038 --> 00:39:07,450
I'm a bigger shit
than even you dreamed of.

510
00:39:07,607 --> 00:39:09,587
But you don't know me.

511
00:39:09,743 --> 00:39:11,950
I wouldn't sleep with your wife.

512
00:39:21,888 --> 00:39:23,060
Go, go, go!

513
00:39:39,305 --> 00:39:40,784
Dog pile!

514
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:28,128
It's not what it looks like.

515
00:40:33,526 --> 00:40:35,631
It never is.

516
00:40:37,597 --> 00:40:39,770
Good luck in Connecticut.

517
00:41:27,847 --> 00:41:29,758
He?
He?'

518
00:41:31,818 --> 00:41:36,494
So I thought I'd come say goodbye.

519
00:41:38,725 --> 00:41:39,931
Okay.

520
00:41:43,763 --> 00:41:45,709
Well, good luck, George.

521
00:41:49,235 --> 00:41:50,612
Hey, Dad.

522
00:41:50,770 --> 00:41:52,113
Hey.

523
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:58,220
I thought maybe you and I could
take a walk. What do you say'? Yeah?

524
00:41:58,378 --> 00:41:59,948
Okay.

525
00:42:07,921 --> 00:42:09,730
So I'm not gonna see you anymore?

526
00:42:09,889 --> 00:42:13,063
You're gonna see me.
Of course you're gonna see me.

527
00:42:13,226 --> 00:42:15,866
We're onna have weekends.
I'm gonna come back...

528
00:42:16,029 --> 00:42:19,203
...and you can come and visit me
in Connecticut.

529
00:42:23,803 --> 00:42:27,046
Hey, I got something for you.

530
00:42:27,206 --> 00:42:29,243
Remember this?

531
00:42:29,909 --> 00:42:33,948
That's the first medal I ever won
with Celtic.

532
00:42:34,781 --> 00:42:36,761
Yeah.

533
00:42:36,916 --> 00:42:40,762
You're gonna win your own someday,
but you can keep that warm for me.

534
00:42:49,095 --> 00:42:53,771
- I'll miss you, son.
- I'm gonna miss you, too, Dad.

535
00:42:53,933 --> 00:42:55,776
Come here.

536
00:43:04,577 --> 00:43:08,457
- We're gonna talk on the phone, okay?
- Okay.

537
00:43:09,449 --> 00:43:13,488
You're gonna call.
And you're gonna write me.

538
00:43:13,653 --> 00:43:15,599
Okay.

539
00:43:19,659 --> 00:43:21,468
Okay.

540
00:43:24,263 --> 00:43:26,300
Okay, I gotta go.

541
00:43:29,035 --> 00:43:30,946
All right, buddy.

542
00:43:56,696 --> 00:43:59,006
- He'll be okay.
- Yeah.

543
00:44:11,644 --> 00:44:15,182
Stace? Hey. Hey.

544
00:44:18,718 --> 00:44:21,858
Look, I'm not stupid.

545
00:44:22,021 --> 00:44:26,527
We've been together three years,
so I think that you owe me the truth.

546
00:44:30,163 --> 00:44:32,040
Do you still love him?

547
00:44:43,109 --> 00:44:45,749
I've never stopped loving him.

548
00:46:30,516 --> 00:46:31,620
Dad.

549
00:46:34,387 --> 00:46:35,559
Hey.

550
00:46:35,721 --> 00:46:37,894
What are you doing here?

551
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:42,997
Well, I was on my way...

552
00:46:43,162 --> 00:46:47,736
...and I suddenly thought
what if I wake up tomorrow morning...

553
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:51,507
...and I want to take another walk
with you? You know?

554
00:46:51,671 --> 00:46:54,413
Yeah, but what about your job?

555
00:46:55,675 --> 00:46:59,145
Well, I don't have it all worked out...

556
00:46:59,312 --> 00:47:03,988
...but I figure if I'm good enough for them,
gotta be good enough for someone here.

557
00:47:05,218 --> 00:47:07,698
You're really here to stay this time?

558
00:47:07,853 --> 00:47:09,696
Yeah. I'm really hereto stay.

559
00:47:11,591 --> 00:47:15,004
Come on.
Let's go play some soccer, all right?

560
00:47:15,161 --> 00:47:16,504
Okay.

561
00:47:18,064 --> 00:47:21,011
All right, come on.
Come on, here you go.

562
00:47:34,914 --> 00:47:37,554
Mom, Dad came home.

563
00:47:41,721 --> 00:47:43,064
You gave up the job?

564
00:47:45,558 --> 00:47:49,062
Someone very smart once told me
you just have to be there.

565
00:47:51,631 --> 00:47:53,440
I called off the wedding.

566
00:47:56,035 --> 00:47:57,070
Why?

567
00:48:00,873 --> 00:48:03,717
Because someone kind of stupid
got in my head.

568
00:48:07,747 --> 00:48:09,784
I can live with that.

569
00:48:13,085 --> 00:48:14,655
Wanna play?

570
00:48:16,289 --> 00:48:18,895
- Yeah. Wanna play?
- Yeah. I wanna play.

571
00:48:19,058 --> 00:48:21,902
Okay. Let's go.

572
00:48:22,061 --> 00:48:24,940
All right, Lewis. Come on.
Here you go.

573
00:48:56,696 --> 00:48:58,972
--And speaking of time, we are out of it.

574
00:48:59,131 --> 00:49:02,806
We'll see you tomorrow night
with the next George and Chip show.

575
00:49:02,968 --> 00:49:05,278
And he means
the Chip and George show.

576
00:49:07,206 --> 00:49:11,484
I thought we agreed it sounded better if
we called it the George then Chip show?

577
00:49:11,644 --> 00:49:15,490
But that was before we had the logo.
Logo says Chip and George.

578
00:49:15,648 --> 00:49:18,686
Yeah, the Chip and George and Chip.
