3
00:00:12,226 --> 00:00:14,678
Miss independent

4
00:00:14,678 --> 00:00:17,066
Miss self-sufficient

5
00:00:17,066 --> 00:00:21,040
Miss keep your distance

6
00:00:23,246 --> 00:00:25,501
Miss unafraid

7
00:00:25,501 --> 00:00:27,847
Miss out of my way

8
00:00:27,847 --> 00:00:33,545
Miss don't let a man interfere, no

9
00:00:33,545 --> 00:00:36,318
Miss on her own

10
00:00:36,318 --> 00:00:38,292
Miss almost grown

11
00:00:38,292 --> 00:00:43,195
Miss never let a man help her off her throne

12
00:00:43,195 --> 00:00:46,257
So, by keeping her heart protected

13
00:00:46,257 --> 00:00:49,219
She'll never, ever feel rejected

14
00:00:49,219 --> 00:00:51,661
Little miss apprehensive

15
00:00:51,661 --> 00:00:54,456
Said ooh, she fell in love

16
00:00:54,456 --> 00:00:57,554
What is this feeling taking over?

17
00:00:57,554 --> 00:01:00,196
Thinking no one could open the door

18
00:01:00,196 --> 00:01:05,691
Surprise, it's time, to feel what's real

19
00:01:05,691 --> 00:01:08,492
What happened to miss independent's

20
00:01:08,492 --> 00:01:11,221
no longer need to be defensive?

21
00:01:11,221 --> 00:01:17,351
Goodbye, old you, when love, is true.

22
00:01:23,101 --> 00:01:25,600
Misguided heart

23
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,323
Miss play it smart

24
00:01:27,323 --> 00:01:33,329
Miss if you wanna use that line, you better not start, no

25
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:36,343
But she miscalculated

26
00:01:36,343 --> 00:01:38,727
She didn't wanna end up jaded

27
00:01:38,727 --> 00:01:43,335
And this miss decided not to miss out on true love

28
00:01:43,335 --> 00:01:46,101
So, by changing a misconception

29
00:01:46,101 --> 00:01:48,874
She went in a new direction

30
00:01:48,874 --> 00:01:52,247
And found inside, she felt a connection

31
00:01:52,247 --> 00:01:54,892
She fell in love

32
00:01:54,892 --> 00:01:57,595
What is this feeling taking over?

33
00:01:57,595 --> 00:02:00,297
Thinking no one could open the door

34
00:02:00,297 --> 00:02:05,819
Surprise, it's time, to feel what's real

35
00:02:05,819 --> 00:02:08,498
What happened to miss independent's

36
00:02:08,498 --> 00:02:11,403
no longer need to be defensive?

37
00:02:11,403 --> 00:02:17,375
Goodbye, old you, when love, is true (when love, is true)

38
00:02:17,375 --> 00:02:23,003
When miss independent walked away

39
00:02:23,003 --> 00:02:28,562
No time for love that came her way

40
00:02:28,562 --> 00:02:34,144
She looked in the mirror and thought today

41
00:02:34,144 --> 00:02:39,461
What happened to miss no longer afraid?

42
00:02:39,461 --> 00:02:44,818
It took some time for her to see

43
00:02:44,818 --> 00:02:49,849
How beautiful love could truly be

44
00:02:49,849 --> 00:02:55,530
No more talk of why can't that be me

45
00:02:55,530 --> 00:03:00,262
I'm so glad I've finally seen

46
00:03:00,262 --> 00:03:03,037
What is this feeling taking over?

47
00:03:03,037 --> 00:03:05,776
Thinking no one could open the door

48
00:03:05,776 --> 00:03:11,250
Surprise, it's time, to feel what's real

49
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:14,038
What happened to miss independent's

50
00:03:14,038 --> 00:03:16,825
no longer need to be defensive?

51
00:03:16,825 --> 00:03:24,056
Goodbye, old you, when love, is true (when love, is true)

52
00:03:28,723 --> 00:03:31,600
Miss independent

53
00:03:31,601 --> 00:03:41,601
