1
00:02:31,667 --> 00:02:32,683
It's mine.

2
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:33,892
-Get down.
-You're not allowed!

3
00:02:33,958 --> 00:02:35,308
-Good day, Mr. Phipps.
-You're not allowed!

4
00:02:35,375 --> 00:02:36,500
Get down.

5
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,917
You'll have no supper if you keep that up.

6
00:02:43,458 --> 00:02:45,250
-Hello, Joy.
-Hello.

7
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:49,333
-Is all well?
-Very good. Thank you.

8
00:02:50,667 --> 00:02:51,683
-Hello.
-Hello.

9
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,625
-Good morning, Joy.
-Hello.

10
00:02:54,292 --> 00:02:55,542
-Sorry.
-Welcome.

11
00:02:57,542 --> 00:02:58,875
Where is Mr. Keats?

12
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,833
I'm afraid he is not joining us.

13
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:03,292
He's in Mr. Brown's half of the house.

14
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,208
Hello.

15
00:03:06,042 --> 00:03:07,100
Hello.

16
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:12,542
The very well stitched Little Miss Brawne
in all her detail.

17
00:03:13,625 --> 00:03:15,042
Good morning.

18
00:03:17,042 --> 00:03:20,250
What is this? What have I done?
How have I offended?

19
00:03:20,417 --> 00:03:22,833
I don't shake hands with the enemy.

20
00:03:23,083 --> 00:03:26,875
An enemy? What have I done to you?

21
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:31,708
You do nothing to me or for me,
and that's how I'd prefer to keep it.

22
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:34,500
What?

23
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:38,125
Your offense is to my fashion, Mr. Brown.

24
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:39,308
Oh, dear.

25
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:41,750
To which I'm ''so helplessly slavish.''

26
00:03:41,917 --> 00:03:43,792
I have been ill-quoted.

27
00:03:43,917 --> 00:03:47,333
''Her obsession
with flounce and cross-stitch''?

28
00:03:48,042 --> 00:03:49,667
Cross-stitch? Miss Brawne,

29
00:03:49,792 --> 00:03:53,167
-I don't even know what that means.
-For goodness' sake. Baiting, baiting.

30
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:55,625
I feel the same about your poems,
Mr. Brown.

31
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,542
I know nothing of what they mean.

32
00:03:57,708 --> 00:04:01,208
They puff smoke, dissolve,
leaving nothing but irritation.

33
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:06,875
Fanny, take this tea to Mr. Keats.
He is in very poor spirits.

34
00:04:07,292 --> 00:04:10,375
Mr. Keats is composing
and does not want disturbing.

35
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:14,167
It's my finding in the business of disturbing,
you're the expert.

36
00:04:14,292 --> 00:04:17,208
Fanny, why not speak to one of us
you hold in higher favor?

37
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:18,542
I'm praising him!

38
00:04:18,667 --> 00:04:20,583
-Fanny.
-Please, Fanny.

39
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:24,042
I'm wanting to know what you shall say
about Mr. Keats.

40
00:04:24,167 --> 00:04:26,833
I've been waiting two weeks
that I may enjoy your opinion.

41
00:04:26,958 --> 00:04:29,333
I cannot look upon him without smiling.

42
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:34,500
And he is quick with his thoughts,
though now they are mostly sad.

43
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:37,208
His brother Tom's not at all better.

44
00:04:37,417 --> 00:04:38,708
Very diminished.

45
00:04:39,167 --> 00:04:40,817
Mr. Keats nurses him alone.
It's difficult work.

46
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:42,800
Mr. Keats nurses him alone.
It's difficult work.

47
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:46,583
-Is there no other family member?
-No. The parents are both dead.

48
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:51,750
There is only a much younger sister
and a brother who lives in America.

49
00:05:03,167 --> 00:05:04,333
Come in.

50
00:05:08,417 --> 00:05:10,417
You like jokes, Mr. Keats?

51
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:13,042
I like jokes.

52
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:16,708
Mr. Brown, I warn you,
does not like my jokes.

53
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:19,292
He complains I care 
for nothing but fashion.

54
00:05:25,667 --> 00:05:27,583
Would you like biscuits?

55
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:31,458
You've come to spy.

56
00:05:33,167 --> 00:05:34,333
Spy?

57
00:05:35,625 --> 00:05:40,000
How will you describe me? My character?

58
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,542
I am not the least interested
in your character.

59
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:52,292
My jacket, then? Or my pantaloons?

60
00:05:56,167 --> 00:05:58,917
You need a new jacket,
that's what I would say.

61
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:00,417
Is that all?

62
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:04,375
It should be of velvet, blue velvet.

63
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,875
Tell me, Miss Brawne,
how can you be so sure?

64
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:15,833
Well, all I wear,
I've sewn and designed myself.

65
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,875
I'm often told
I am clever to exception about design.

66
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,542
I originated the pleats on my dress,
which are charming...

67
00:06:27,917 --> 00:06:32,417
Has she annoyed you sufficiently?
She has done brilliant well with me.

68
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:34,208
Men's room, out.

69
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:36,542
Poets got to do a bit of writing.

70
00:06:36,667 --> 00:06:40,708
My stitching has more merit and admirers
than your two scribblings put together.

71
00:06:43,417 --> 00:06:44,542
Goodbye, minxstress.

72
00:06:44,708 --> 00:06:46,083
And I can make money from it.

73
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:20,542
Yes?

74
00:07:20,917 --> 00:07:23,333
Have you got John Keats' poem book...

75
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:27,792
<i>-Endymion?
-Endymion, yes.</i>

76
00:07:27,917 --> 00:07:30,458
Yes, I've not heard much good about it.

77
00:07:30,625 --> 00:07:33,542
I've not sold one and took 20.

78
00:07:35,792 --> 00:07:39,292
My sister has met the author,
and she wants to read it for herself

79
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:41,542
to see if he is an idiot or not.

80
00:08:06,792 --> 00:08:08,042
Unwrap it.

81
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:30,625
Read it.

82
00:08:33,583 --> 00:08:38,250
''A thing of beauty is a joy for ever
Its loveliness increases. It will never

83
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:43,583
''Pass into nothingness, but still will keep
A bower quiet for us, and a sleep

84
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:47,167
''Full of sweet dreams, and health
and quiet breathing''

85
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:49,208
-Stop.
-''Therefore, on...''

86
00:08:57,583 --> 00:09:00,125
''Yes, in spite of all

87
00:09:01,167 --> 00:09:05,417
''Some shape of beauty moves away the pall
From our dark spirits''

88
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:43,375
I'd love to speak with Mr. Keats.

89
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:06,708
''A thing of beauty is a joy forever
Its loveliness increases. It will never

90
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:08,542
''Pass into nothingness''

91
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:10,000
<i>You've read Endymion.</i>

92
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:13,958
I wanted to adore it.

93
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:18,875
-But you hated it?
-I can't say.

94
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:24,000
Are you frightened to speak truthfully?

95
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:27,375
-Never.
-Well, tell me then.

96
00:10:27,917 --> 00:10:31,417
No. I'm not clever with poetry.

97
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:34,375
Well, neither, it seems, am I.

98
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:40,250
-Still I have some hope for myself.
-I think hope useful.

99
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:46,292
-But...
-Hope and results are different.

100
00:10:47,792 --> 00:10:50,042
One doesn't necessarily create the other.

101
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:53,292
Would practice help?

102
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:56,708
It might.
I wasn't always able to stitch so well.

103
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:03,042
This is the first frock
in all of Woolwich or Hampstead

104
00:11:03,167 --> 00:11:05,208
to have a triple-pleated mushroom collar.

105
00:11:06,917 --> 00:11:09,625
Isn't that an identical one behind you?

106
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:26,042
My card's completely full.

107
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:30,417
But you don't dance, Mr. Keats.
I love to dance.

108
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:33,583
I don't feel like dancing.

109
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:37,375
Is your brother still ill?

110
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:39,792
He's no better.

111
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,708
My father was ill
for as long as I can remember.

112
00:11:45,542 --> 00:11:47,750
He died when I was still very young.

113
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:50,208
Excuse me.

114
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,500
Miss Brawne, may I?

115
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:02,583
Mama!

116
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:09,208
Fanny has cut my ribbon,
and she never asked.

117
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:14,083
What are you doing, Fanny?

118
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:16,542
Trying to bring some comfort
to a dying man.

119
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:19,000
What dying man?
Where are you taking them?

120
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:23,750
I cannot offer poor Mr. Keats' brother
anything that's not perfect.

121
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:43,708
It's me. Miss Brawne.

122
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,042
I have something to deliver to Mr. Keats.

123
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:50,000
Leave it at the door.

124
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:54,042
-Is he not there?
-We're working, Miss Brawne.

125
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:57,167
I have something for your brother, Mr. Keats.

126
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:01,458
Invite her in. Brown!

127
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,708
You disgusting ape.

128
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:18,667
Be careful as you enter the ape's cage.

129
00:13:20,708 --> 00:13:22,750
Sit next to me, Miss Brawne.

130
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,417
My prospects in the world feel very faint.

131
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:32,292
This room is so poorly cared for.

132
00:13:35,667 --> 00:13:37,083
Please try one.

133
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,667
I'm anxious they'll cause him to choke.

134
00:13:44,167 --> 00:13:47,750
No! Try another and I swear I shall bite you.

135
00:13:47,917 --> 00:13:50,042
Take care. She has sharp teeth.

136
00:13:51,167 --> 00:13:54,458
She has sunk her fangs into my poor poem
and shook it apart.

137
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:58,625
<i>I am very sorry I couldn't love
your Endymion completely, Mr. Keats.</i>

138
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:01,000
Perhaps I did not say,

139
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:05,042
but I thought the beginning of your poem
something very perfect.

140
00:14:08,417 --> 00:14:12,417
But don't leave us. You can see for yourself,
nothing is happening.

141
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:15,958
All we do is lie about the room all day,
begging for inspiration.

142
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:18,708
Please, tell me what I should do.

143
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:25,542
Miss Brawne,
we monkeys just want a little company.

144
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:35,167
Well, I gave him the biscuits.

145
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,042
Mr. Brown kept...

146
00:14:39,917 --> 00:14:43,208
If we've finished tiffing,
come and say hello to Tom.

147
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:45,583
It might cheer him.

148
00:14:45,917 --> 00:14:47,375
We'll have to ask Mama.

149
00:14:47,542 --> 00:14:50,042
-No, we don't, Toots.
-Yes, we do.

150
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:51,667
Isn't that so, Samuel?

151
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:53,792
We have to stick together.

152
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:57,458
I'm going. You'll have to come with me.

153
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:04,875
Would you like to go by the pond
or through the woods?

154
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:09,583
I've explored all these paths, which are more
in number than your eyelashes.

155
00:15:11,167 --> 00:15:12,583
My eyelashes?

156
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:23,417
You know, it amazes me
you can sit opposite Mr. Brown all day.

157
00:15:25,167 --> 00:15:28,292
I've never heard him say one thing of wit.
Not one.

158
00:15:29,417 --> 00:15:31,875
-You favor wit?
-I rate it the highest.

159
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:37,292
-You like the fashionables?
-Yes, I do.

160
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:43,500
Men who say things that make you start
without making you feel?

161
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:45,208
Things that are amusing.

162
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:49,292
I know these dandies.

163
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:54,667
They have a mannerism in their very eating
and drinking, their handling of a decanter.

164
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:59,042
You are making an attack on me?

165
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:03,583
No, I am defending
Mr. Brown's generous, good heart.

166
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:06,167
By attacking myself.

167
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:12,542
Forgive me.

168
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,875
I've been too long at my brother's sickbed.

169
00:16:18,542 --> 00:16:21,458
Can we not still appreciate clever humor?

170
00:16:34,667 --> 00:16:37,667
Thank God! He's been calling out for you.

171
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:40,542
Come in.

172
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:43,583
John.

173
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:45,708
-I didn't... I didn't...
-Tom.

174
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:47,667
-What?
-Tom, get back into bed.

175
00:16:47,792 --> 00:16:51,875
-I don't know. I was having this dream.
-It's all right. I'm here now.

176
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,958
-I'm here.
-Where have you been, John?

177
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:58,375
-I just... I was worried.
-Calm now. Calm.

178
00:16:58,917 --> 00:17:00,417
It's all right. I'm here.

179
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:03,167
It's so hot in this bed.

180
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:06,625
I was so scared for a while.

181
00:17:07,417 --> 00:17:08,708
-Calm down.
-I just panicked.

182
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:11,292
I want to go. I want to leave. It smells.

183
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:14,500
Or I'II cut your hair in the night.

184
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:25,975
-Good evening, John.
-Young man, how are you?

185
00:17:26,042 --> 00:17:27,583
Good evening.

186
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,892
Well, Keats,
I hope you've not forgotten your bassoon.

187
00:17:29,958 --> 00:17:31,833
Of course not. It's in my waistcoat pocket.

188
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,958
-Hello, Mr. Keats.
-Hello, Minx.

189
00:17:34,458 --> 00:17:35,458
How's Tom?

190
00:17:35,625 --> 00:17:37,500
Gentlemen of the orchestra,
just through here.

191
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:39,500
Ladies, straight ahead, please. Thank you.

192
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:40,625
Hurry on, gentlemen.

193
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,875
Is he showing any signs of improvement?

194
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:45,375
Don't ask me of Tom, Minx.

195
00:17:45,542 --> 00:17:48,375
The only good I can do
is say how I love him.

196
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,208
Hurry on, gentlemen.

197
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:55,583
Shall we open the claret?

198
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:07,125
<i>Someone submitted anonymously
to The Examiner a most exquisite sonnet</i>

199
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:11,875
composed on the subject of whether
Love itself could be the 10th muse. Severn!

200
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,017
-Come on.
-En garde!

201
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:14,167
Right.

202
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:19,000
That's my sword, you brute.

203
00:18:20,667 --> 00:18:21,667
Love the 10th muse?

204
00:18:21,792 --> 00:18:24,750
It's full of the most perfect allusions
and really beautifully realized.

205
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:27,042
I thought at first it might be one of yours.

206
00:18:28,417 --> 00:18:31,833
<i>We were just telling Mrs. Brawne
of John Keats' review in Blackwood's.</i>

207
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,667
Was it so very bad?

208
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:40,792
''No man could have profaned and vulgarized

209
00:18:40,917 --> 00:18:45,917
''every association in the manner which has
been adopted by this 'son of promise.'''

210
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:51,417
Did they not admire the opening?
It was perfect. Even I could know that.

211
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:55,875
-Do you Like poetry, Miss Brawne?
-No.

212
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:58,708
Poems are a strain to work out.

213
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:01,975
John, we are talking, or are about to talk,

214
00:19:02,042 --> 00:19:05,250
<i>of your defense
of Mr. Keats' poem Endymion.</i>

215
00:19:05,417 --> 00:19:06,500
Yes.

216
00:19:09,417 --> 00:19:13,042
''I have clung
To nothing, lov'd a nothing, nothing seen

217
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:16,167
''Or felt but a great dream! O I have been

218
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:19,125
''Presumptuous against Love
against the sky

219
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:22,958
''Against all elements, against the tie
Of mortals each to each''

220
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:25,333
The rhythm is beautiful and unique.

221
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:28,142
There are rhymes, but not on the beat.
They're quiet, but binding.

222
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:31,208
And the repetitions set you up to fly.

223
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:34,958
''I have clung
To nothing, lov’d a nothing, nothing seen''

224
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:37,667
And here you come out
''Or felt but a great dream!''

225
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:38,833
It's beautiful.

226
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:41,225
Well, there are immaturities,
but there are also immensities,

227
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:43,000
and that is what they didn't say.

228
00:19:43,167 --> 00:19:45,333
It was said. You said it, Brother.

229
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,750
Thank you.

230
00:19:46,917 --> 00:19:48,333
Very bravely.

231
00:19:52,292 --> 00:19:55,083
Ladies, the Hampstead Heathens
are about to begin.

232
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:56,875
-Reynolds?
-I thought I'd been expelled.

233
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,500
No. I think not. You're very much needed.

234
00:21:24,958 --> 00:21:26,792
Mr. Keats is dead.

235
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:38,375
Mr. Keats is dead. So young.

236
00:21:46,917 --> 00:21:48,125
Is it Tom?

237
00:22:29,542 --> 00:22:34,750
I woke with the strange sensation
of someone holding my hand.

238
00:22:35,417 --> 00:22:37,833
I opened my eyes, and there was John.

239
00:22:38,875 --> 00:22:41,958
I knew immediately what had happened,
and then he said,

240
00:22:42,083 --> 00:22:47,833
''Tom died at 8:00, quietly and without pain.''

241
00:22:53,708 --> 00:22:55,708
Of course, he can't go on living there,

242
00:22:55,833 --> 00:22:59,708
so I have invited Mr. Keats
to come and stay with me.

243
00:23:00,542 --> 00:23:03,750
Well, we do have a Long schedule of visits.

244
00:23:03,917 --> 00:23:05,767
I don't want to interfere with your city plans,

245
00:23:05,833 --> 00:23:07,642
but you are most welcome
to have dinner with us.

246
00:23:07,708 --> 00:23:09,808
-Minx? Are you unwell?
-We have provided and set the table.

247
00:23:09,875 --> 00:23:11,167
No, no, no, not at all.

248
00:23:11,292 --> 00:23:13,475
-I've never seen you so quiet.
-I would appreciate it.

249
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:16,042
We do have some city business.

250
00:23:23,083 --> 00:23:24,625
She sewed it all night Long.

251
00:23:33,083 --> 00:23:34,708
It's a pillow slip.

252
00:23:37,292 --> 00:23:39,750
Then I will rest Tom's head upon it.

253
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:51,667
Keats, the Reynolds are expecting us.

254
00:23:52,208 --> 00:23:54,667
I'II catch you up. Thank you.

255
00:23:57,458 --> 00:23:59,792
Invite me again, alone.

256
00:24:01,083 --> 00:24:02,208
Come for Christmas.

257
00:24:09,917 --> 00:24:12,958
Yes, please do join us, Mr. Keats, please.

258
00:24:13,542 --> 00:24:17,417
But Marianne Reynolds invited us
for Christmas. Remember?

259
00:24:17,583 --> 00:24:20,083
You were there when she said it.
They're having musicians.

260
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:21,750
I am sorry to spoil things.

261
00:24:21,917 --> 00:24:24,667
Not at all. Wherever Mr. Keats is happy,
we're happy for him.

262
00:24:24,792 --> 00:24:27,667
-Thank you, Mrs. Brawne.
-But why can't he be happy with us?

263
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,083
Perhaps Mr. Brown wants
Mr. Keats all to himself.

264
00:24:32,125 --> 00:24:36,208
I am merely remembering to Mr. Keats
a previous engagement.

265
00:24:36,958 --> 00:24:39,542
Miss Brawne, I thought we were conversing.

266
00:24:57,625 --> 00:25:00,667
''Dear Mrs. Brawne.
May I yet join you for Christmas?

267
00:25:00,792 --> 00:25:03,750
''I have not the health
nor the heart to be anywhere

268
00:25:03,917 --> 00:25:07,208
''but with a family such as your own.
John Keats.''

269
00:25:20,667 --> 00:25:21,792
Thank you.

270
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,583
I was wondering this morning
if you're sleeping in my bed.

271
00:25:50,167 --> 00:25:51,250
Pardon?

272
00:25:51,917 --> 00:25:53,917
You see, I believe you are.

273
00:25:54,542 --> 00:25:56,392
We rented Mr. Brown's half of the house
this summer

274
00:25:56,417 --> 00:25:58,708
while you were journeying in Scotland.

275
00:25:58,833 --> 00:26:00,542
Which room do you sleep in?

276
00:26:01,542 --> 00:26:03,542
The one overlooking the back garden.

277
00:26:03,708 --> 00:26:05,542
That was my bed.

278
00:26:08,917 --> 00:26:10,625
For proof, pull it from the wall

279
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:13,542
and by the pillow, you will find a figure
I drew with pin holes.

280
00:26:13,667 --> 00:26:15,250
Is the figure you?

281
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:17,917
It's a fairy princess.

282
00:26:20,208 --> 00:26:24,042
-Should I be feeding her?
-She refuses to eat.

283
00:26:28,917 --> 00:26:30,542
Would you teach me poetry?

284
00:26:33,792 --> 00:26:36,750
I'd... I'd Like to understand it.

285
00:26:38,875 --> 00:26:40,500
I don't know how to begin.

286
00:26:40,625 --> 00:26:42,375
<i>And it's three to the right.</i>

287
00:26:42,667 --> 00:26:44,833
Two, three. Three to the left.

288
00:26:44,958 --> 00:26:46,542
Two, three.

289
00:26:54,917 --> 00:26:57,333
And down. And keep it going.

290
00:26:58,292 --> 00:27:00,833
So that's the English drawing room.

291
00:27:02,625 --> 00:27:04,917
And this is something
that I saw in Scotland.

292
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:12,958
They kick,

293
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:18,417
and they jump,

294
00:27:20,125 --> 00:27:21,875
and they twirl it,

295
00:27:23,417 --> 00:27:27,042
and they sweat it,
and they tattooed the floor Like mad!

296
00:27:34,917 --> 00:27:36,375
What about a poem?

297
00:27:36,542 --> 00:27:40,208
-Yes. Please, Mr. Keats.
-A short one.

298
00:27:46,458 --> 00:27:49,208
''When I have fears that I may cease to be

299
00:27:51,667 --> 00:27:55,125
''Before my pen has glean'd
my teeming brain

300
00:27:57,833 --> 00:28:00,375
''Before high-piled books, in charact'ry

301
00:28:01,833 --> 00:28:04,875
''Hold Like rich garners
the full-ripen'd grain

302
00:28:07,583 --> 00:28:10,417
''When I behold, upon the
night's starr'd face

303
00:28:12,208 --> 00:28:15,583
''Huge cloudy symbols of a high romance''

304
00:28:25,792 --> 00:28:28,875
-I do apologize. I've gone blank.
-You're tired.

305
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,625
Should you Like some sweet?

306
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:32,375
Shall we have coffee and sweet?

307
00:29:17,417 --> 00:29:19,208
Come through to our side.

308
00:29:39,417 --> 00:29:40,958
I've come for my poetry class.

309
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,417
Your poetry class?

310
00:29:46,292 --> 00:29:51,000
Poetry classes!
Keats, are we teaching poetry today?

311
00:29:55,708 --> 00:29:57,292
I hope I don't disturb.

312
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,333
Take a seat.

313
00:30:01,875 --> 00:30:03,542
Have a look at that.

314
00:30:06,542 --> 00:30:08,708
A poet is not at all poetical.

315
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:13,458
He is the most un-poetical thing
in existence.

316
00:30:15,333 --> 00:30:17,167
He has no identity.

317
00:30:17,417 --> 00:30:21,333
He is continually filling some other body,
the sun, the moon.

318
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,417
I cannot restrain my credibility longer.

319
00:30:26,125 --> 00:30:30,042
Miss Brawne,
is this really you or are you acting?

320
00:30:31,583 --> 00:30:34,167
-It's really me.
-Is it?

321
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:36,625
Charles, I have a pupil.

322
00:30:37,625 --> 00:30:40,167
-Desist or depart.
-Apologies.

323
00:30:55,583 --> 00:30:59,458
My modest hope is that the cost
of the lesson will not be the poet.

324
00:30:59,583 --> 00:31:03,625
The cost of the lesson is that Mr. Keats
will forthwith discuss poetry with me.

325
00:31:03,917 --> 00:31:06,000
You don't mean to read the poems?

326
00:31:06,125 --> 00:31:08,250
Until I know all the poets and poems
in the world,

327
00:31:08,417 --> 00:31:10,768
since I've nothing to do,
as you so many times have noted.

328
00:31:10,792 --> 00:31:12,625
I bow to your ambition.

329
00:31:22,292 --> 00:31:25,250
Now he's gone, I shall find it easier to talk.

330
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,875
Can you say something
of the craft of poetry?

331
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,917
Poetic craft is a carcass, a sham.

332
00:31:49,625 --> 00:31:51,934
If poetry does not come as naturally
as leaves to a tree,

333
00:31:51,958 --> 00:31:53,917
then it had better not come at all.

334
00:32:01,375 --> 00:32:03,125
I am mistaken.

335
00:32:06,083 --> 00:32:07,583
I am not sure I can teach you.

336
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:11,000
Was I too rude? I... I can apologize.

337
00:32:11,542 --> 00:32:16,208
I'm not sure I have
the right feelings towards women.

338
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:22,000
I'm suspicious of my feelings.

339
00:32:23,708 --> 00:32:25,375
Do you not Like me?

340
00:32:27,625 --> 00:32:30,375
I'm attracted to you without knowing why.

341
00:32:34,833 --> 00:32:37,333
AII women confuse me, even my mother.

342
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,875
I yearn to be ruined by shrews
and saved by angels,

343
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,583
and in reality,
I've only ever really loved my sister.

344
00:32:51,708 --> 00:32:54,542
I'm annoyed by my sister
as often as I Love her.

345
00:32:58,167 --> 00:33:00,208
I still don't know how to work out a poem.

346
00:33:01,125 --> 00:33:03,083
A poem needs understanding
through the senses.

347
00:33:05,625 --> 00:33:09,208
The point of diving in a lake

348
00:33:11,458 --> 00:33:14,042
is not immediately to swim to the shore

349
00:33:14,208 --> 00:33:19,208
but to be in the Lake,
to luxuriate in the sensation of water.

350
00:33:21,792 --> 00:33:23,917
You do not work the lake out.

351
00:33:25,083 --> 00:33:27,667
It is an experience beyond thought.

352
00:33:30,167 --> 00:33:34,208
Poetry soothes and emboldens
the soul to accept mystery.

353
00:33:36,042 --> 00:33:37,458
I Love mystery.

354
00:33:41,167 --> 00:33:44,375
I found your fairy princess
on the wall in my room.

355
00:33:45,333 --> 00:33:46,917
And you could make her out?

356
00:33:47,083 --> 00:33:48,708
She wears a butterfly frock.

357
00:33:51,667 --> 00:33:53,375
Shall we continue?

358
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:10,333
Mr. Keats is very brilliant.

359
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:16,667
I'm not sure he really likes me.

360
00:34:17,917 --> 00:34:24,458
He prefers Toots and Samuel, even our cat,
who he is always petting to death.

361
00:34:26,708 --> 00:34:28,458
Mr. Keats knows he cannot Like you.

362
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:32,833
He has no Living and no income.

363
00:34:53,292 --> 00:34:55,500
Mr. Keats isn't here.

364
00:34:56,792 --> 00:35:01,268
He said to tell you he had a sore throat and
thought it best to stay on in Chichester.

365
00:35:01,292 --> 00:35:03,042
Samuel, hello.

366
00:35:03,167 --> 00:35:05,333
You don't believe me. Come in.

367
00:35:06,417 --> 00:35:07,583
Come in.

368
00:35:10,458 --> 00:35:13,208
There, no Keats.

369
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:19,542
Tell us, what Chaucer did you read?

370
00:35:19,708 --> 00:35:20,725
AII of it.

371
00:35:22,167 --> 00:35:26,208
<i>Also, Mr. Spenser,
Mr. Milton, and The Odyssey.</i>

372
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,625
That's a lot to read in one week.

373
00:35:31,958 --> 00:35:33,750
<i>What did you think of The Odyssey?</i>

374
00:35:33,917 --> 00:35:35,083
Thank you.

375
00:35:36,625 --> 00:35:41,583
I am yet partway through it,
but I have read all Mr. Keats has written.

376
00:35:42,333 --> 00:35:43,542
Have you?

377
00:35:50,333 --> 00:35:53,750
''Out went the taper as she hurried in

378
00:35:54,958 --> 00:35:58,375
''Its little smoke, in pallid moonshine, died

379
00:36:00,208 --> 00:36:03,708
''She clos'd the door, she panted, all akin

380
00:36:03,875 --> 00:36:07,292
''To spirits of the air, and visions wide''

381
00:36:07,417 --> 00:36:11,375
<i>And... And what, Miss Brawne,
did you make of Paradise Lost?</i>

382
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:15,542
-I... I liked it.
-Did you?

383
00:36:17,583 --> 00:36:21,292
You didn't find Milton's rhymes
a little pouncing?

384
00:36:21,833 --> 00:36:22,833
No.

385
00:36:24,958 --> 00:36:26,958
-Did you not?
-Not very.

386
00:36:35,583 --> 00:36:39,542
Is it the material of her dress that makes
Miss Brawne's eyes so amber-Like?

387
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:44,458
Yes, they are golden.

388
00:36:45,083 --> 00:36:48,292
-Amber almost.
-Yes, yes.

389
00:36:48,417 --> 00:36:49,725
What color are yours, Mr. Brown?

390
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:50,808
Mine?

391
00:36:58,583 --> 00:37:01,708
-Suitcase brown.
-Fanny!

392
00:37:06,833 --> 00:37:10,333
Did you see Mr. Brown? He was amazed.

393
00:37:11,833 --> 00:37:15,042
Well, all those authors in just one week
is a bit incredible.

394
00:37:15,167 --> 00:37:16,292
I know.

395
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:20,125
But he sees I'm serious.
And I will read them.

396
00:37:32,958 --> 00:37:34,708
Fanny, it's a letter.

397
00:37:36,792 --> 00:37:38,750
I think it's a valentine.

398
00:38:02,042 --> 00:38:05,875
''Darling Valentine, I am not sure
if you should have a kiss

399
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,708
''for your amber enchantress eyes
or a whipping.

400
00:38:15,375 --> 00:38:17,083
''Yours, the Suitcase.''

401
00:38:38,792 --> 00:38:39,875
Fanny,

402
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,333
Mr. Keats is behaving very oddly.

403
00:38:47,667 --> 00:38:49,417
Should I invite him inside?

404
00:39:01,917 --> 00:39:05,792
-Mr. Brown sent you a Valentine?
-I think it was a joke.

405
00:39:07,792 --> 00:39:12,250
Keats! Keats! John, wait.

406
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:26,042
-John.
-I was away but 10 days, Brown,

407
00:39:26,167 --> 00:39:28,167
with you encouraging me
to stay on and get well.

408
00:39:28,292 --> 00:39:29,500
-John, easy.
-Now,

409
00:39:29,625 --> 00:39:31,917
you write Miss Brawne a valentine card.
Are you lovers?

410
00:39:32,083 --> 00:39:33,292
-John.
-Is that the truth?

411
00:39:33,417 --> 00:39:35,583
-Easy.
-You sent a card, Charles!

412
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:37,517
You have the income to marry,
where I have not.

413
00:39:37,583 --> 00:39:38,808
Did you accept him, Miss Brawne?

414
00:39:38,875 --> 00:39:41,958
John, I sent that valentine...

415
00:39:43,667 --> 00:39:44,875
It was only a jest.

416
00:39:45,042 --> 00:39:48,208
For whom? I'm not laughing.
Miss Brawne is not Laughing!

417
00:39:48,375 --> 00:39:52,875
John, I wrote the valentine to amuse Fanny,
who makes a religion of flirting.

418
00:39:53,042 --> 00:39:54,267
John, she's what?
A poetry scholar one week

419
00:39:54,292 --> 00:39:57,667
-and, what, a military expert the next?
-You disgust me.

420
00:39:58,250 --> 00:40:02,875
It is a game. It is a game to her.
She collects suitors. John... John...

421
00:40:03,042 --> 00:40:06,833
There is a holiness to the heart's
affections. Know you nothing of that?

422
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:21,042
Believe me, it's not pride!

423
00:40:38,250 --> 00:40:40,167
You're in Love with Mr. Brown?

424
00:40:51,833 --> 00:40:53,625
Why don't you speak?

425
00:40:55,875 --> 00:41:00,083
She can't speak because she only knows
how to flirt and sew.

426
00:41:03,125 --> 00:41:04,625
Isn't that right?

427
00:41:07,958 --> 00:41:13,917
Yes, and read all Milton,
whose rhymes do not pounce, Miss Brawne,

428
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:16,042
because there are none!

429
00:41:17,042 --> 00:41:18,583
John, there are one or two of her kind

430
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:21,458
in every fashionable drawing room
of this city,

431
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:24,917
gasping over skirt lengths.

432
00:41:29,083 --> 00:41:31,208
I'm sorry.
We can have a poetry Lesson tomorrow.

433
00:41:31,375 --> 00:41:34,333
No! I want to dance and flirt,

434
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:38,708
talk of flounces and ribbons
till I find my old happiness and humor.

435
00:41:52,375 --> 00:41:56,500
What if the dwarf were to die in Act 2?

436
00:41:57,750 --> 00:41:59,875
And then we could introduce
the princess sooner.

437
00:42:00,042 --> 00:42:01,500
The princess.

438
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:04,708
Perhaps Act 3 could begin with a tempest.

439
00:42:08,083 --> 00:42:09,875
What else do you think?

440
00:42:30,917 --> 00:42:32,833
We're going to live next door.

441
00:42:32,958 --> 00:42:36,500
The Dilkes are moving to Westminster,
and we get six months half rent!

442
00:42:36,875 --> 00:42:39,583
So we'll be in the same house.
We can all play football.

443
00:42:40,833 --> 00:42:42,708
It's a great economy for Mama.

444
00:42:46,083 --> 00:42:47,208
But only if you Like.

445
00:42:47,333 --> 00:42:49,583
Have we broken for the day, Keats?

446
00:42:53,042 --> 00:42:54,125
Keats!

447
00:42:59,625 --> 00:43:01,342
-Throw the rope up.
-Excuse me, miss.

448
00:43:03,958 --> 00:43:06,208
There should be another one of them.

449
00:43:10,292 --> 00:43:13,542
But if the princess has already abandoned
the dwarf,

450
00:43:13,667 --> 00:43:16,042
I mean, cannot we keep his Love speech?

451
00:43:17,083 --> 00:43:20,042
We have to change it.
Find another place for it.

452
00:43:20,417 --> 00:43:23,625
-We could give the Love speech to...
-Look out!

453
00:43:27,583 --> 00:43:29,708
Sorry, right in the face.

454
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,833
Brown? Brown!

455
00:43:36,375 --> 00:43:37,708
Oh, no!

456
00:43:39,917 --> 00:43:42,125
-What was that, Toots?
-Oh, no!

457
00:43:53,708 --> 00:43:57,458
If Mr. Keats and myself
are strolling in a meadow,

458
00:43:58,083 --> 00:44:02,667
lounging on a sofa or staring into a wall,
do not presume we're not working.

459
00:44:03,125 --> 00:44:07,042
Doing nothing is the musing of the poet.

460
00:44:08,083 --> 00:44:12,125
Are these musings what we common people
know as thoughts?

461
00:44:12,417 --> 00:44:16,667
Thoughts, yes, but of a weightier nature.

462
00:44:17,250 --> 00:44:18,792
Sinking thoughts?

463
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:24,042
Not really, Miss Brawne. Musing,
making one's mind available to inspiration.

464
00:44:25,208 --> 00:44:26,458
Mr. Brown?

465
00:44:26,833 --> 00:44:28,250
As in amusing?

466
00:44:30,083 --> 00:44:33,600
Mr. Brown, our thoughts are all very simple,

467
00:44:33,625 --> 00:44:35,792
so you never need worry
about interrupting us.

468
00:44:35,958 --> 00:44:39,125
And we should be happy
if you would join us for dinner on any day.

469
00:45:01,583 --> 00:45:03,083
Can I choose which bed?

470
00:45:37,458 --> 00:45:38,708
Mr. Keats.

471
00:46:28,417 --> 00:46:31,708
They're sniffing all the flowers in the garden
to try and find the best scent.

472
00:46:33,208 --> 00:46:35,333
Mr. Keats is being a bee.

473
00:46:41,417 --> 00:46:42,667
Thank you.

474
00:46:45,875 --> 00:46:46,958
Fanny!

475
00:46:47,917 --> 00:46:49,042
Come in.

476
00:46:49,583 --> 00:46:51,125
I need your help.

477
00:47:15,375 --> 00:47:18,375
Lie to me.
Tell me you did not dance last night.

478
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:21,833
I did not sit down a single tune.

479
00:47:22,917 --> 00:47:26,375
You can see the truth in my slippers,
completely scuffed.

480
00:47:26,958 --> 00:47:28,600
I don't know how I could have prevented it.

481
00:47:28,625 --> 00:47:31,583
I don't want to sit and wait under the trees
while you talk.

482
00:47:31,708 --> 00:47:34,375
-I want to go and play on the swing.
-AII right.

483
00:47:36,083 --> 00:47:39,958
-Lovely.
-I'm not! Don't go lower. Go higher. Higher.

484
00:47:40,083 --> 00:47:41,375
No. A bit Lower.

485
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:08,625
I had such a dream last night.

486
00:48:10,583 --> 00:48:12,708
I was floating above the trees

487
00:48:13,333 --> 00:48:16,500
with my lips connected
to those of a beautiful figure

488
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,875
for what seemed Like an age.

489
00:48:22,167 --> 00:48:24,292
Flowery treetops sprang up beneath us,

490
00:48:24,458 --> 00:48:28,250
and we rested on them
with the lightness of a cloud.

491
00:48:36,667 --> 00:48:38,292
Who was the figure?

492
00:48:51,750 --> 00:48:55,917
I must have had my eyes closed,
because I can't remember.

493
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,125
And yet, you remember the treetops.

494
00:49:01,792 --> 00:49:03,792
Not so well as I remember the Lips.

495
00:49:08,583 --> 00:49:12,500
Whose lips? Were they my lips?

496
00:49:54,417 --> 00:49:55,500
Fanny?

497
00:50:08,417 --> 00:50:09,475
Fanny?

498
00:50:15,583 --> 00:50:16,958
Fanny?

499
00:50:20,750 --> 00:50:21,792
Fanny!

500
00:51:28,917 --> 00:51:32,042
<i>Mr. Brown bet I couldn't find
the nightingale's nest.</i>

501
00:51:32,167 --> 00:51:34,750
<i>There is no nest and no bet.</i>

502
00:51:39,250 --> 00:51:40,667
That one over there.

503
00:51:40,792 --> 00:51:43,100
You couldn’t have seen it in a tree.
They don't nest in trees.

504
00:51:43,125 --> 00:51:45,583
I know what I saw. It was a nightingale.

505
00:52:07,167 --> 00:52:10,375
''Soon, trembling in her soft and chilly nest

506
00:52:10,542 --> 00:52:15,167
''In sort of wakeful swoon, perplexed she lay''

507
00:52:16,292 --> 00:52:18,708
See, here, there are tears.

508
00:52:22,667 --> 00:52:25,292
You're so far ahead of me and above me.

509
00:52:30,958 --> 00:52:33,458
Brown, I'm amazed.

510
00:52:36,250 --> 00:52:42,750
Your writing is the finest thing in my life.

511
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:54,333
You wrote this, Little hand, did you do it?

512
00:53:04,583 --> 00:53:06,500
As one who truly loves you,

513
00:53:06,667 --> 00:53:09,667
I must warn you kindly
of a trap that you are walking into, John.

514
00:53:09,833 --> 00:53:14,542
If you are going to speak of Miss Brawne,
we have never agreed and cannot agree.

515
00:53:14,667 --> 00:53:18,958
For one or two of your ''slippery blisses,''
you'll lose your freedom permanently.

516
00:53:19,083 --> 00:53:22,708
You will be slaving at medicine
15 hours a day and for what?

517
00:53:23,292 --> 00:53:25,792
To keep Mrs. Keats in French ribbon.

518
00:53:28,875 --> 00:53:31,583
I cherish your talent. I truly do.

519
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:35,167
Then allow me my happiness,
for I am writing again.

What?

539
00:55:44,583 --> 00:55:48,875
Have you told Miss Brawne
of our summer holiday, or shall I?

540
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,292
Not as yet.

541
00:55:58,750 --> 00:56:03,250
Mr. Brown is doing his summer rental,
so we both have to Leave.

542
00:56:05,417 --> 00:56:10,333
We're meeting up on the Isle of Wight
for some undisturbed writing and carousing.

543
00:56:26,792 --> 00:56:28,542
Mrs. Brawne, may I speak to Fanny, please?

544
00:56:28,708 --> 00:56:31,375
No, I will not speak to him.

545
00:56:31,958 --> 00:56:34,208
Fanny, I was going to tell you.

546
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,833
Fanny, I have no money.

547
00:56:47,042 --> 00:56:49,167
In fact, I am in debt.

548
00:56:51,167 --> 00:56:55,042
I must earn. I must write and make a Living.

549
00:56:57,083 --> 00:56:58,517
If I fail, though I hate to think on it,

550
00:56:58,583 --> 00:57:02,375
then I must make way so another may marry
and adore you as I wish to.

551
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:08,667
No! I will not be adored ever again
by you or by anyone!

552
00:57:12,625 --> 00:57:14,417
I hate you!

553
00:57:37,750 --> 00:57:38,808
Anything?

554
00:57:38,917 --> 00:57:40,292
No. Nothing.

555
00:57:46,375 --> 00:57:47,542
Nothing.

556
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:57,167
Fanny, will you check my stitch?
It's an open-work seam.

557
00:57:57,292 --> 00:57:58,208
God.

558
00:57:58,625 --> 00:58:01,417
No, Toots. I don't care a damn for stitches!

559
00:58:24,083 --> 00:58:26,250
-No letter?
-Not today.

560
00:58:34,208 --> 00:58:35,375
Am I in Love?

561
00:58:39,417 --> 00:58:40,708
Is this Love?

562
00:58:46,167 --> 00:58:48,583
I shall never tease about it again.

563
00:58:53,542 --> 00:58:56,042

01:04:46,542 --> 01:04:48,042
You missed that one.

624
01:04:49,458 --> 01:04:51,875
-Hello.
-Hello.

625
01:05:03,375 --> 01:05:07,583
Mama asked me to welcome you home
and introduce you to Miss O'Donoghue,

626
01:05:07,750 --> 01:05:10,667
our new maid who may also do for you.

627
01:05:10,792 --> 01:05:13,583
Please, sir, call me Abigail or Abby.

628
01:05:14,542 --> 01:05:17,375
Very well. Be sure you do not enter
if the door is closed.

629
01:05:17,542 --> 01:05:18,708
Yes, sir.

630
01:05:27,875 --> 01:05:31,125
Mr. Keats is not coming back.
He has gone to Live in London.

631
01:05:34,083 --> 01:05:37,292
Please tell Mr. Keats that we Brawnes
have kept safe all his things.

632
01:05:50,458 --> 01:05:53,667
Mr. Brown has said that
I could learn to read still.

633
01:05:54,208 --> 01:05:56,958
I said to him, ''Sure, what would I read?''

634
01:05:57,625 --> 01:06:02,875
And he said, ''Abigail, even the Bible
is not so dull as you might believe.''

635
01:06:03,042 --> 01:06:08,125
And that in the Songs of Solomon,
there are some bits so juicy,

636
01:06:08,250 --> 01:06:10,792
they'd make even a churchman blush.

637
01:06:11,542 --> 01:06:14,833
And he said that when I get down
to the reading myself,

638
01:06:14,958 --> 01:06:18,250
I'II see he tells not one word of a lie.

639
01:06:34,250 --> 01:06:35,667
Hello, Toots.

640
01:06:50,083 --> 01:06:51,667
Hello, Mr. Keats.

641
01:06:53,375 --> 01:06:55,042
Hello, Miss Brawne.

642
01:07:01,375 --> 01:07:05,042
Mother? We found it.
Fanny had the key, Like I thought.

643
01:07:21,917 --> 01:07:23,708
What do you need for London?

644
01:07:57,167 --> 01:07:58,917
Your vest has no lining.

645
01:08:04,625 --> 01:08:06,125
And your coat

646
01:08:14,458 --> 01:08:16,208
has a small hole.

647
01:08:16,917 --> 01:08:19,042
I could mend it so you wouldn’t see it.

648
01:08:23,042 --> 01:08:26,750
<i>''My sweet girl,
I am living today in yesterday.</i>

649
01:08:27,958 --> 01:08:30,750
<i>''I was in a complete fascination all day.</i>

650
01:08:31,292 --> 01:08:33,792
<i>''I feel myself at your mercy.</i>

651
01:08:33,917 --> 01:08:35,875
<i>''Write me ever so few lines and tell me</i>

652
01:08:36,083 --> 01:08:39,458
<i>''you will never forever be less kind to me
than yesterday.</i>

653
01:08:40,417 --> 01:08:42,208
<i>''You dazzled me.</i>

654
01:08:42,375 --> 01:08:45,667
<i>''There is nothing in the world
so bright and delicate.</i>

655
01:08:47,458 --> 01:08:49,250
<i>''You have absorbed me.</i>

656
01:08:49,917 --> 01:08:53,333
<i>''I have a sensation at the present moment
as if I was dissolving. ''</i>

657
01:09:11,417 --> 01:09:15,375
Fanny, Mrs. Dilke is telling me that

658
01:09:17,042 --> 01:09:19,500
Mr. Keats is proposing
to move in next door again,

659
01:09:19,667 --> 01:09:22,333
and she wants to know
if I have any objections.

660
01:09:22,458 --> 01:09:24,208
Of course you don't.

661
01:09:26,167 --> 01:09:28,917
Mr. Brown is Mr. Keats' best friend.
Why would we object?

662
01:09:31,042 --> 01:09:34,542
Fanny, Mr. Dilke and I are worried

663
01:09:34,708 --> 01:09:38,875
that such close connection
may prove restrictive for you.

664
01:09:39,333 --> 01:09:40,333
No.

665
01:09:41,583 --> 01:09:45,083
Mr. Keats can't afford to marry.

666
01:09:45,917 --> 01:09:48,625
His situation is really quite hopeless,

667
01:09:49,208 --> 01:09:52,167
and if he is next door,
how will you meet anyone else?

668
01:09:52,333 --> 01:09:54,292
How will you go to dances?

669
01:09:56,083 --> 01:09:57,333
But you are engaged?

670
01:09:57,458 --> 01:09:59,542
It's his mother's ring.
It's not an engagement ring.

671
01:09:59,708 --> 01:10:01,667
You were not to wear it.

672
01:10:01,792 --> 01:10:03,708
I wear it on the finger next door.

673
01:10:03,875 --> 01:10:04,917
Do not even discuss it.

674
01:10:05,083 --> 01:10:10,000
You taught me to Love. You never said
only the rich, only a thimbleful.

675
01:10:11,542 --> 01:10:14,458
Attachment is such a difficult thing to undo.

676
01:12:01,042 --> 01:12:03,958
''Pillowed upon
my fair love's ripening breast

677
01:12:06,917 --> 01:12:09,958
''To feel forever its soft swell and fall

678
01:12:12,208 --> 01:12:15,042
''Awake forever in a sweet unrest

679
01:12:17,250 --> 01:12:21,542
''Still, still to hear her tender-taken breath''

680
01:12:27,542 --> 01:12:28,875
That's new.

681
01:12:32,250 --> 01:12:33,708
From which poem?

682
01:12:36,125 --> 01:12:37,167
Yours.

683
01:12:48,083 --> 01:12:49,708
''Bright star,

684
01:12:52,167 --> 01:12:54,583
''would I were steadfast as thou art

685
01:12:57,292 --> 01:13:00,167
''Not in Ione splendor hung aloft the night''

686
01:13:07,208 --> 01:13:08,958
Why do you say ''not''?

687
01:13:10,583 --> 01:13:12,417
''Not in Ione splendor''?

688
01:13:14,708 --> 01:13:19,667
You fear I am not steadfast because
I oblige Mama by going to a dance?

689
01:13:23,125 --> 01:13:24,958
Don't tease, Fanny.

690
01:13:27,125 --> 01:13:28,875
Why are you Laughing?

691
01:13:32,042 --> 01:13:34,167
I shall tell her I am unwell.

692
01:13:36,542 --> 01:13:37,875
No, go.

693
01:13:40,375 --> 01:13:41,500
Go.

694
01:13:45,083 --> 01:13:46,117
Go.

695
01:13:48,042 --> 01:13:50,083
Good Irish Abigail,

696
01:13:50,208 --> 01:13:55,292
who never did fail to make a scone
as good as a swan.

697
01:14:01,708 --> 01:14:03,542
Would you Like some jam with that, sir?

698
01:14:03,708 --> 01:14:04,958
Please.

699
01:14:10,875 --> 01:14:12,083
Delicious.

700
01:14:19,917 --> 01:14:23,375
Fanny! Come in. It's turned cold.

701
01:14:23,708 --> 01:14:26,500
Mr. Keats has gone to London with no coat.

702
01:15:02,375 --> 01:15:03,958
John, have you had wine?

703
01:15:05,417 --> 01:15:08,625
I was severely chilled.

704
01:15:10,625 --> 01:15:13,875
I was on the outside of the coach,

705
01:15:17,375 --> 01:15:18,792
but now I don't feel it.

706
01:15:19,417 --> 01:15:20,750
Abigail!

707
01:15:22,708 --> 01:15:25,625
Abigail! Get up, dress yourself.
We need a doctor.

708
01:15:30,708 --> 01:15:33,042
Abigail, bring the water.

709
01:15:33,500 --> 01:15:35,500
I need a basin and a towel.

710
01:15:36,875 --> 01:15:38,042
And glasses, I need glasses.

711
01:15:38,208 --> 01:15:40,875
-Let me help. I can...
-Stand back, stand back.

712
01:16:08,708 --> 01:16:13,208
Keats has already asked to see Miss Brawne,

713
01:16:13,375 --> 01:16:16,625
but I've managed him
and said that she had gone into town.

714
01:16:17,042 --> 01:16:18,375
But I have not.

715
01:16:18,500 --> 01:16:21,833
I am speaking of keeping Mr. Keats calm.

716
01:16:21,958 --> 01:16:24,417
This is a deception I will not join.

717
01:16:24,583 --> 01:16:27,042
No, no, it is not a deception.

718
01:16:27,708 --> 01:16:32,292
I am simply determined
to preserve the Life of my friend.

719
01:16:32,750 --> 01:16:34,933
You would have it that
I kill Mr. Keats with affection.

720
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,292
-Fanny!
-Perhaps you will.

721
01:16:37,958 --> 01:16:41,917
Apparently, there is nothing I can do to
persuade you of the gravity of the situation,

722
01:16:42,042 --> 01:16:45,708
but Keats is in my care
and all visits will follow my regime

723
01:16:45,833 --> 01:16:47,083
or they will not happen at all.

724
01:16:47,208 --> 01:16:51,625
Please, we Brawnes will do whatever we can
to restore Mr. Keats to health.

725
01:17:08,250 --> 01:17:10,292
I was wondering where you were.

726
01:17:11,292 --> 01:17:14,542
I have been waiting
to be with you the whole day.

727
01:17:18,042 --> 01:17:19,792
Last night there was a...

728
01:17:26,500 --> 01:17:28,417
There was a great rush of blood,

729
01:17:30,500 --> 01:17:33,667
such that I thought that I would suffocate.

730
01:17:36,792 --> 01:17:41,167
And I said to Mr. Brown,
''This is unfortunate.''

731
01:17:43,708 --> 01:17:45,792
My thoughts were of you.

732
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:20,458
<i>''My sweet creature, when I send this round,
I shall be in the front parlor,</i>

733
01:18:21,167 --> 01:18:24,625
<i>''watching to see you show yourself
for a minute in the garden.</i>

734
01:18:28,750 --> 01:18:32,417
<i>''When I look back upon the ecstasies
in which I have passed some days</i>

735
01:18:32,542 --> 01:18:34,625
<i>''and the miseries in their turn,</i>

736
01:18:34,750 --> 01:18:39,167
<i>''I wonder the more at the beauty
which has kept up the spell so fervently.</i>

737
01:18:40,042 --> 01:18:44,167
<i>''How horrid was the chance of slipping
into the ground instead of into your arms.</i>

738
01:18:45,958 --> 01:18:48,208
<i>''The difference is amazing, love. ''</i>

739
01:18:54,375 --> 01:18:57,833
-Go on! Go on, now!
-No, Brown. Brown. Brown.

740
01:18:58,750 --> 01:19:00,542
I get anxious if I don't see her.

741
01:19:07,917 --> 01:19:09,417
Why not bed her?

742
01:19:10,083 --> 01:19:12,125
She'd do whatever you wished.

743
01:19:12,292 --> 01:19:14,000
It might relieve your condition.

744
01:19:27,083 --> 01:19:29,583
<i>''Do not take the trouble of writing much.</i>

745
01:19:29,708 --> 01:19:34,000
<i>''Merely send me my good night
to put under my pillow. John Keats. ''</i>

746
01:20:19,833 --> 01:20:22,542
<i>''Let me no longer detain you
from going to town.</i>

747
01:20:23,333 --> 01:20:26,167
<i>''There may be no end
to this imprisoning of you.</i>

748
01:20:27,958 --> 01:20:31,208
<i>''Perhaps you had better not come
before tomorrow evening.</i>

749
01:20:31,333 --> 01:20:36,833
<i>''You know our situation. I am recommended
not even to read poetry, much less write it.</i>

750
01:20:38,458 --> 01:20:40,583
<i>''I wish I had even a little hope.</i>

751
01:20:42,500 --> 01:20:44,333
<i>''I cannot say forget me,</i>

752
01:20:45,417 --> 01:20:49,000
<i>''but I would mention that
there are impossibilities in the world. ''</i>

753
01:21:33,875 --> 01:21:38,500
John, why do you say ''impossibilities''?

754
01:21:39,542 --> 01:21:43,125
I have coughed blood again.

755
01:21:49,083 --> 01:21:52,875
I fear the disease has the upper hand

756
01:21:55,083 --> 01:21:56,625
and I will not recover.

757
01:21:57,542 --> 01:21:59,083
I can't Leave you.

758
01:22:01,917 --> 01:22:05,042
I have such clear hope
for your new book of poems.

759
01:22:07,500 --> 01:22:10,250
John, they are more beautiful than
any I have read of Mr. Coleridge,

760
01:22:10,375 --> 01:22:13,625
Mr. Wordsworth, even Lord Byron.

761
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,875
''O what can ail thee, knight-at-arms

762
01:22:22,500 --> 01:22:24,875
''Alone and palely loitering?

''The sedge has wither'd from the Lake
And no birds sing''

764
01:22:36,708 --> 01:22:39,042
''I met a lady in the meads

765

''Full beautiful, a faery's child

766
01:22:46,375 --> 01:22:50,708
''Her hair was Long, her foot was light

767
01:22:52,083 --> 01:22:53,708
''And her eyes were wild

768
01:22:56,750 --> 01:22:59,250
''I set her on my pacing steed

''She found me roots of relish sweet

''And sure in language strange she said
'I Love thee true'''

''She took me to her elfin grot''

775
01:23:30,375 --> 01:23:34,583
''And there she wept, and sigh'd full sore''

776
01:23:35,375 --> 01:23:40,250
''And there I shut her wild wild eyes
With kisses four

01:23:46,208 --> 01:23:49,292
''And there I dream'd, ah! woe betide!

779
01:23:50,875 --> 01:23:53,042
''The latest dream I ever dream'd

780
01:23:57,208 --> 01:23:59,042
''On the cold hill side''

781
01:24:07,833 --> 01:24:09,000
Abigail?

782
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:17,667
Here it is.
Mr. Brown said to give it to you tomorrow,

783
01:24:17,792 --> 01:24:19,375
but I'II not wait.

784
01:24:21,625 --> 01:24:23,583
He is the most cruel,

785
01:24:26,125 --> 01:24:29,333
dead-hearted man in this entire world.

786
01:24:30,542 --> 01:24:31,958
Oh, my God!

787
01:24:33,542 --> 01:24:37,208
Oh, my God, I wish I were dead.

788
01:24:39,375 --> 01:24:41,000
I am boiling with fury.

789
01:24:41,167 --> 01:24:43,542
John, you must not convulse again.

790
01:24:44,667 --> 01:24:49,500
Abigail is with child,
but to whom, out of fear or shame,

791
01:24:49,625 --> 01:24:51,042
she would not say.

792
01:24:52,042 --> 01:24:56,042
We, Brown, must find out who it is,
and when we have his name,

793
01:24:56,208 --> 01:24:59,583
then butcher or baker,
he shall face up to his indecency.

794
01:25:02,250 --> 01:25:05,167
-Will you call her?
-It's not necessary.

795
01:25:08,417 --> 01:25:11,292
She has me believe I'm the father.

796
01:25:12,542 --> 01:25:16,083
My God, I had no notion of a Love affair.

797
01:25:20,708 --> 01:25:24,167
There was none,
or I must have slept through it.

798
01:25:26,875 --> 01:25:29,458
With what ease you help yourself.

799
01:25:30,083 --> 01:25:32,167
I have agreed to pay for the child.

800
01:25:34,042 --> 01:25:38,958
And the worst thing is
I can't keep this place.

801
01:25:40,250 --> 01:25:42,875
I have to start my summer rental early.

802
01:25:44,042 --> 01:25:48,417
And I feel wretched turning you out
while you are so unwell,

803
01:25:49,667 --> 01:25:51,792
but, John, I can't do anything else.

804
01:25:52,542 --> 01:25:53,875
I'm overloaded with debt.

805
01:25:54,042 --> 01:25:55,708
Don't concern yourself.

806
01:25:57,083 --> 01:26:00,458
-I shall manage.
-Stupid. Stupid.

807
01:26:11,042 --> 01:26:13,875
In what stumbling ways a new soul is begun.

808
01:26:15,167 --> 01:26:17,167
I'd very much value your opinion, Mr. Keats,

809
01:26:17,292 --> 01:26:20,917
<i>on a new painting of mine,
The Cave of Despair. I was...</i>

810
01:26:21,042 --> 01:26:23,667
If you are suggesting he won't survive
another winter in England,

811
01:26:23,833 --> 01:26:25,167
then we must do something.

812
01:26:25,292 --> 01:26:27,933
Gentlemen, I think we should hear
Dr. Bree on the issue of climate

813
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:29,167
for Keats' health.

814
01:26:29,333 --> 01:26:32,208
Well, a move to a gentler climate
is essential.

815
01:26:33,083 --> 01:26:34,333
I would recommend Italy.

816
01:26:34,458 --> 01:26:36,458
-Rome?
-Rome is good.

817
01:26:37,333 --> 01:26:40,750
-Does he want to go to Rome?
-Well, he has to go.

818
01:26:40,875 --> 01:26:43,583
He won't Live through another winter
in England.

819
01:26:48,458 --> 01:26:50,000
How do you feel about Italy, John?

820
01:26:50,125 --> 01:26:52,583
I do think there is an issue of finance.

821
01:26:56,708 --> 01:27:00,167
Could we not, between us,
start a fund or a coIIection?

822
01:27:01,292 --> 01:27:02,708
It seems possible.

823
01:27:05,708 --> 01:27:09,292
Of course, he'll need a traveling companion.
Brown, you’ll go?

824
01:27:09,417 --> 01:27:11,000
Absolutely, absolutely.

825
01:27:11,125 --> 01:27:14,875
Someone must go.
I'm not sure I shall be able.

826
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,625
-Is that a ''no''?
-Miss. Miss.

827
01:27:28,750 --> 01:27:32,167
I can help find a room for the summer,
John, if you want.

828
01:27:34,917 --> 01:27:37,500
Sammy, walk behind.

829
01:27:41,208 --> 01:27:43,208
I want to go to Italy with you.

830
01:27:44,042 --> 01:27:46,333
We can marry, and I'II go with you.

831
01:27:47,125 --> 01:27:50,000
My friends talk of going to Italy,
but I have so Little money.

832
01:27:50,125 --> 01:27:51,958
Spare a penny, sir?

833
01:27:52,083 --> 01:27:54,542
I can barely afford
these Kentish Town rooms.

834
01:27:55,458 --> 01:27:56,875
Farewell me here.

835
01:27:57,042 --> 01:27:58,100
Why?

836
01:28:00,542 --> 01:28:02,167
We don't do linen.

837
01:28:09,292 --> 01:28:12,208
AII right, I'm coming!

838
01:28:30,333 --> 01:28:31,875
Mr. Hunt can't have meant this room.

839
01:28:38,792 --> 01:28:40,708
I told you not to come.

840
01:28:43,417 --> 01:28:44,542
Go now.

841
01:28:48,875 --> 01:28:49,933
Go.

842
01:28:54,500 --> 01:28:55,875
Please start.

843
01:28:59,083 --> 01:29:00,292
-Please start.
-Where's Fanny?

844
01:29:00,417 --> 01:29:01,475
Thank you.

845
01:29:02,708 --> 01:29:04,250
She's not eating.

846
01:29:18,875 --> 01:29:20,375
Are you all right?

847
01:29:24,375 --> 01:29:26,958
How Long has Mr. Keats been away?

848
01:29:27,083 --> 01:29:28,375
Five weeks.

849
01:29:30,167 --> 01:29:32,167
Perhaps it is for the best.

850
01:29:33,833 --> 01:29:34,917
Whose best?

851
01:29:36,667 --> 01:29:41,542
I thought it might be a relief to be separated
when the circumstances are so difficult.

852
01:29:42,417 --> 01:29:46,708
You all wish I would give up, but I can't.

853
01:29:48,292 --> 01:29:50,333
Even if I wanted to, I cannot.

854
01:30:35,750 --> 01:30:36,792
John!

855
01:30:38,125 --> 01:30:40,583
Keep away from me if you do not Love me,

856
01:30:40,708 --> 01:30:43,583
if you have not a crystal conscience
this past month.

857
01:30:44,375 --> 01:30:45,917
Oh, my Love.

858
01:30:54,042 --> 01:30:56,083
I thought my heart was breaking.

859
01:30:58,125 --> 01:31:01,042
Mama! Mama!

860
01:31:03,417 --> 01:31:04,750
Mr. Keats?

861
01:31:05,292 --> 01:31:07,250
Toots, the door.

862
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:15,375
Take care.

863
01:31:19,542 --> 01:31:22,375
John. John?

864
01:31:27,833 --> 01:31:29,125
Thank you.

865
01:31:32,042 --> 01:31:34,458
-Was there any blood?
-No.

866
01:31:36,708 --> 01:31:38,417
Is he staying here?

867
01:31:39,750 --> 01:31:41,833
Yes, yes. Tonight.

868
01:31:43,875 --> 01:31:46,375
Well, I need to examine the patient.

869
01:31:58,250 --> 01:32:01,917
May he stay tomorrow?
Till he Leaves for Italy?

870
01:32:02,375 --> 01:32:04,792
But you are not even officiaIIy engaged.

871
01:32:05,542 --> 01:32:07,042
Can't we be?

872
01:32:09,375 --> 01:32:11,167
There is no end to this.

873
01:32:11,750 --> 01:32:14,542
Next, you’ll want to marry
then travel to Rome.

874
01:32:15,333 --> 01:32:17,917
I should never have moved into this house.

875
01:32:18,042 --> 01:32:19,042
I have let this happen.

876
01:32:19,208 --> 01:32:20,667
Just until Italy.

877
01:32:23,292 --> 01:32:26,833
You are already the source
of so much gossip.

878
01:32:26,958 --> 01:32:29,083
Well then, Let us be engaged.

879
01:33:10,167 --> 01:33:11,250
Toots.

880
01:33:22,042 --> 01:33:23,500
Have you been eating rosebuds again?

881
01:33:26,833 --> 01:33:28,833
So where do your cheeks get their blush?

882
01:33:35,667 --> 01:33:39,917
<i>I confirmed your ship,
the Maria Crowther, sailing for Naples.</i>

883
01:33:40,417 --> 01:33:41,458
When does she Leave?

884
01:33:41,625 --> 01:33:42,875
-In 10 days.
-So soon?

885
01:33:43,042 --> 01:33:44,042
Autumn is coming.

886
01:33:44,208 --> 01:33:47,667
I'm afraid if you delay
there'll be less and less reason to hope.

887
01:33:48,583 --> 01:33:50,417
Then there's no putting it off.

888
01:33:52,375 --> 01:33:54,500
I must march against the battery.

889
01:33:54,625 --> 01:33:56,417
Allow me to pour you another, Mr. Severn.

890
01:33:56,542 --> 01:33:58,475
Really? Well, perhaps I might just tip it back.

891
01:33:58,542 --> 01:34:00,792
-Is his passage fully paid for?
-Yes, yes.

892
01:34:00,917 --> 01:34:02,500
Everything's taken care of.

893
01:34:05,542 --> 01:34:07,833
What if something should happen
to Mr. Keats

894
01:34:07,958 --> 01:34:13,125
or even to you, in a foreign country?

895
01:34:14,375 --> 01:34:16,000
How would you survive?

896
01:34:17,625 --> 01:34:20,875
It shouldn’t be Severn. He barely knows him.

897
01:34:21,625 --> 01:34:23,517
Where is that fool Mr. Brown
when he is needed?

898
01:34:23,542 --> 01:34:25,542
And why hasn't he written?

899
01:34:27,208 --> 01:34:30,417
I found a goose for Mr. Keats' Last dinner.

900
01:34:33,958 --> 01:34:35,500
Don't say ''Last.''

901
01:34:43,375 --> 01:34:47,500
...two, three. One, two, three.
One, two, three. And one, two, three.

902
01:34:47,708 --> 01:34:50,000
One, two, three. One, two, three.
One, two, three.

903
01:34:50,125 --> 01:34:53,042
One, two, three. One, two, three.
One, two, three. One, two, three.

904
01:34:59,125 --> 01:35:00,208
Toots?

905
01:35:03,958 --> 01:35:05,208
Mr. Keats?

906
01:35:05,333 --> 01:35:07,000
One, two, three...

907
01:35:11,375 --> 01:35:13,750
-She's gone.
-What happened there?

908
01:35:22,458 --> 01:35:27,208
One, two, three. One, two, three.
One, two, three.

909
01:35:27,333 --> 01:35:28,667
Very good.

910
01:35:33,500 --> 01:35:36,958
And don't come back.
There's no autumn around here.

911
01:35:37,708 --> 01:35:38,833
Careful.

912
01:35:41,542 --> 01:35:43,125
Are you all right?

913
01:35:45,958 --> 01:35:47,458
Shall we sit down?

914
01:36:47,083 --> 01:36:49,167
Mrs. Brawne, that's for you.

915
01:36:51,125 --> 01:36:52,667
It's beautiful.

916
01:36:53,208 --> 01:36:55,667
My dear, mad boy.

917
01:36:56,625 --> 01:36:58,167
Is it successful?

918
01:36:58,667 --> 01:37:02,042
There were two very positive reviews,
by friends,

919
01:37:03,458 --> 01:37:07,375
and six mainly positive and four hostile.

920
01:37:10,208 --> 01:37:11,792
I don't know, is that successful?

921
01:37:11,917 --> 01:37:14,375
Yes, extremely so.

922
01:37:15,708 --> 01:37:17,083
So they're selling well?

923
01:37:22,875 --> 01:37:25,417
Come back. Live with us.

924
01:37:26,292 --> 01:37:27,750
Marry our Fanny.

925
01:37:44,667 --> 01:37:45,958
I Love you.

926
01:37:54,208 --> 01:37:56,333
We should say our goodbyes now.

927
01:38:13,250 --> 01:38:14,750
Shall we awake

928
01:38:20,333 --> 01:38:22,458
and find all this is a dream?

929
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:28,083
There must be another Life.

930
01:38:28,208 --> 01:38:31,417
We can't be created
for this kind of suffering.

931
01:38:43,333 --> 01:38:47,208
I doubt that we will see each other again
on this earth.

932
01:38:53,542 --> 01:38:55,958
Then why are you leaving?

933
01:38:57,875 --> 01:38:59,417
Why must you go?

934
01:39:00,750 --> 01:39:03,208
Because my friends have paid my way.

935
01:39:04,750 --> 01:39:06,833
It is a hopeless hope,
but how can I refuse them?

936
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:08,667
Say you are too ill.

937
01:39:10,708 --> 01:39:13,583
We have woven a web, you and I,

938
01:39:15,542 --> 01:39:17,542
attached to this world

939
01:39:18,708 --> 01:39:21,458
but a separate world of our own invention.

940
01:39:22,250 --> 01:39:24,500
We must cut the threads, Fanny.

941
01:39:25,208 --> 01:39:26,292
No.

942
01:39:27,542 --> 01:39:28,708
No.

943
01:39:31,542 --> 01:39:33,375
I can't.

944
01:39:35,625 --> 01:39:36,917
I never will.

945
01:39:46,875 --> 01:39:49,000
You know I would do anything.

946
01:39:56,417 --> 01:39:58,125
I have a conscience.

947
01:40:15,208 --> 01:40:19,042
-Let's pretend I will return in spring.
-You will return.

948
01:40:31,292 --> 01:40:33,333
We will Live in the country.

949
01:40:36,875 --> 01:40:38,292
Close to Mama.

950
01:40:40,250 --> 01:40:43,625
And our bedroom will Look out
onto a Little apple orchard

951
01:40:44,750 --> 01:40:47,292
and, beyond that, a mountain in a mist.

952
01:40:49,208 --> 01:40:53,375
We can make a garden
where every sort of wildflower grows.

953
01:40:55,792 --> 01:40:59,708
And we will go to bed
while the sun is still high.

954
01:41:02,250 --> 01:41:06,250
And when it becomes dark,
the moon will shine through the shutters.

955
01:41:13,708 --> 01:41:17,750
And I will hold you close
and kiss your breasts,

956
01:41:20,083 --> 01:41:23,458
your arms, your waist.

957
01:41:28,042 --> 01:41:29,375
Everywhere.

958
01:41:41,375 --> 01:41:43,042
Touch has a memory.

959
01:41:45,458 --> 01:41:46,708
I know it.

960
01:42:18,292 --> 01:42:19,583
Not a word.

961
01:43:02,042 --> 01:43:05,375
Mama, Mr. Brown's baby has red hair.

962
01:43:05,542 --> 01:43:07,000
Hello!

963
01:43:08,250 --> 01:43:10,417
You beautiful boy.

964
01:43:11,500 --> 01:43:14,500
Hello. Well done. Well done.

965
01:43:15,125 --> 01:43:16,458
Hello.

966
01:43:17,042 --> 01:43:19,000
It is so nice to meet you.

967
01:43:23,375 --> 01:43:25,250
You've seen the baby?

968
01:43:27,292 --> 01:43:29,542
Looks Like Abigail.

969
01:43:35,750 --> 01:43:37,542
John's reached Naples.

970
01:43:39,208 --> 01:43:41,208
They quarantined his ship.

971
01:43:42,167 --> 01:43:47,375
He wrote that he made more puns
out of desperation in two weeks

972
01:43:47,542 --> 01:43:50,167
than he had in any year of his Life.

973
01:43:53,500 --> 01:43:56,667
I should have Liked to have been there
to have heard them.

974
01:43:57,292 --> 01:44:00,833
You could have, had you gone.

975
01:44:09,958 --> 01:44:11,708
It's not that simple,

976
01:44:11,875 --> 01:44:15,875
with a baby and my funds reduced.

977
01:44:17,667 --> 01:44:23,042
And then there is this issue
of the snow and the Alps.

978
01:44:23,500 --> 01:44:25,167
And lack of will.

979
01:44:33,542 --> 01:44:35,292
Shall I say it aloud?

980
01:44:36,292 --> 01:44:37,708
Will that satisfy you?

981
01:44:41,958 --> 01:44:43,250
Shall I say it?

982
01:44:44,500 --> 01:44:46,417
I have failed John Keats.

983
01:44:47,167 --> 01:44:49,042
I failed John Keats.

984
01:44:50,708 --> 01:44:53,833
I failed John Keats!

985
01:44:54,167 --> 01:44:57,042
I failed him! I failed him!

986
01:44:59,375 --> 01:45:04,958
I did not know until now how tightly
he'd wound himself around my heart.

987
01:45:14,708 --> 01:45:18,167
It's for you, Mama. It's from Italy.

988
01:45:34,667 --> 01:45:36,333
It's from Mr. Keats.

989
01:45:38,083 --> 01:45:40,333
He says, ''It looks Like a dream.''

990
01:47:01,750 --> 01:47:03,083
Start again.

991
01:47:37,750 --> 01:47:39,208
It's cold out.

992
01:47:42,500 --> 01:47:43,517
How are you all?

993
01:47:43,542 --> 01:47:46,667
We're all quite well enough,
but how is Mr. Keats?

994
01:47:47,333 --> 01:47:52,125
Mrs. Brawne, it is as unbearable to me

995
01:47:54,125 --> 01:47:56,125
as I know it is to you.

996
01:47:58,542 --> 01:48:00,167
Mr. Keats has died.

997
01:48:02,750 --> 01:48:05,500
I received an account from Severn,

998
01:48:06,417 --> 01:48:10,250
and I've copied it for you, Miss Brawne.

999
01:48:12,667 --> 01:48:14,375
Shall I just read it?

1000
01:48:27,042 --> 01:48:30,500
''Friday, the 23rd of February.
