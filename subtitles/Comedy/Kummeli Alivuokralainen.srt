NUMMELA FILMI & PORKKANA RYHMÄ
presents

2
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:36,426
Let's do a tail slate.

3
00:02:37,834 --> 00:02:43,541
<i>This was the last</i> scene of
<i>Excalibur 4: The Rod in the Stone.</i>

4
00:02:44,049 --> 00:02:45,888
I just want to tell you all-

5
00:02:46,051 --> 00:02:49,468
that l have taken out a huge loan
to finance this film.

6
00:02:49,554 --> 00:02:55,771
My mum, my granny and my sax-wife's
ex-mother acted as guarantors.

7
00:02:56,728 --> 00:02:58,947
Thanks, everyone...

8
00:02:59,105 --> 00:03:02,273
The wrap party is cancelled.
Fuck you!

9
00:03:04,361 --> 00:03:10,127
Kurre, how was my acting?
I think I found the right focus.

10
00:03:10,241 --> 00:03:12,496
It was a penetrating portrayal.

11
00:03:14,496 --> 00:03:16,964
Kurre, wait.

12
00:03:17,123 --> 00:03:22,047
Here's <i>the poster draft for
Excalibur 3: The Rod in the Stone.</i>

13
00:03:22,212 --> 00:03:28,144
Not bad, eh? You can see the trolls,
the cannibals and the wizard.

14
00:03:28,385 --> 00:03:31,137
<i>This is Excalibur 4.
-what?</i>

15
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:36,105
<i>The first two were Excalibur and
Excalibur 2: The Return of the King.</i>

16
00:03:36,351 --> 00:03:39,104
<i>The Return of the G-String?
-The King.</i>

17
00:03:39,562 --> 00:03:42,351
<i>The Return of the Dingaling.</i>

18
00:03:43,566 --> 00:03:46,450
This will be awesome. This is good.

19
00:03:46,611 --> 00:03:49,530
Tomi Paatelainen
promised to work for us.

20
00:03:49,698 --> 00:03:53,743
He's a great graphic designer.
He married our Stina.

21
00:03:53,827 --> 00:03:56,994
Now they're living
in our villa in Kallvik.

22
00:03:58,999 --> 00:04:02,546
You lovade to fix the lodge.
- I'm busy.

23
00:04:02,711 --> 00:04:05,997
You're always like that!
You don't do anything.

24
00:04:06,339 --> 00:04:11,049
Hey, I'm working. I have to make
the poster for Excalibur.

25
00:04:11,219 --> 00:04:18,883
Your dad is breathing down my neck.
- Then hire a decorator.

26
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:22,263
I don't know any builders.

27
00:04:28,528 --> 00:04:32,989
<i>Directory enquiries. May I help you?
-Mauri Mähönen, Tyrnävä.</i>

28
00:04:33,158 --> 00:04:37,298
<i>Here's a master builder
named Monkki Mähönen.</i>

29
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:41,167
<i>It might be a professional name.
- Put me through, please.</i>

30
00:04:41,249 --> 00:04:44,037
<i>Just a moment.
-Hello?</i>

31
00:04:44,961 --> 00:04:51,047
<i>This is</i> Tomi <i>Paatelainen, hi.
-You little prick. What's up?</i>

32
00:04:51,259 --> 00:04:56,254
I'm in advertisement business.
Film posters and graphic design.

33
00:04:56,598 --> 00:05:00,394
Listen, are you still doing
renovation jobs?

34
00:05:02,896 --> 00:05:05,993
This place is rotten.
It should be torn down.

35
00:05:06,107 --> 00:05:09,939
This is our family villa.
One should respect history...

36
00:05:10,111 --> 00:05:13,030
Don't you teach your father to fuck.

37
00:05:13,657 --> 00:05:16,445
Am I not allowed
to peek inside the walls?

38
00:05:16,618 --> 00:05:20,070
Stina, let Monkki check the building.

39
00:05:20,246 --> 00:05:23,094
Let's take a look at the structure.

40
00:05:26,211 --> 00:05:30,043
Shit a brick and fuck me with it.
It's always like this.

41
00:05:33,009 --> 00:05:37,150
Well, what do you see?
- This is full of shit!

42
00:05:40,183 --> 00:05:42,343
Do you smell it?

43
00:05:50,151 --> 00:05:53,319
Your old bass guitar.
Have you played recently?

44
00:05:55,949 --> 00:06:00,493
What's the meaning of this?
- We're old band mates.

45
00:06:00,662 --> 00:06:04,672
Monkki was the drummer of Cobra.
- I should've known.

46
00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:08,967
Hey, cow. Don't you know
how good a bassist your hubby is?

47
00:06:10,672 --> 00:06:13,425
Time to make a hole.

48
00:06:13,883 --> 00:06:17,763
We asked you here to fix the lodge.

49
00:06:18,763 --> 00:06:22,904
You can sleep in our sauna.
- All right.

50
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,530
For the lodge I have thought...
Please, take a look.

51
00:06:29,733 --> 00:06:32,058
A fifties-style wallpaper -

52
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:36,020
a white panel ceiling
and drapes from this fabric.

53
00:06:36,239 --> 00:06:41,198
Shit! That flower stung me!
Fucking hell...

54
00:06:41,828 --> 00:06:45,625
Tomi, I have pots and pans in my van.
- Pots and pans?

55
00:06:45,915 --> 00:06:50,127
Drums? Really?

56
00:06:50,295 --> 00:06:53,641
Let's put them in the lodge.
They'll fit in there.

57
00:06:54,132 --> 00:06:58,427
He's an intolerable oaf.
He doesn't listen and calls me a cow.

58
00:06:58,553 --> 00:07:01,650
Darling Stina,
he's a man of the people.

59
00:07:01,973 --> 00:07:04,761
You should try to be nice to him.

60
00:07:09,648 --> 00:07:12,531
You forgot the brochures
on the porch.

61
00:07:12,901 --> 00:07:17,860
It'd be jättekiva if you could make
the lodge a little bit cosier...

62
00:07:17,947 --> 00:07:21,459
Okay, but I need
a full case of beer.

63
00:07:21,618 --> 00:07:25,201
Are you going to bring it
now or immediately?

64
00:07:25,288 --> 00:07:27,364
<i>Javisst,</i> of <i>course.</i>

65
00:08:01,825 --> 00:08:04,708
Vad is that? I was startled.

66
00:08:05,286 --> 00:08:09,202
Good double bass drumming. Listen.

67
00:08:12,002 --> 00:08:16,641
I'm sure he's not going to play
for long at his age.

68
00:08:55,503 --> 00:09:00,890
"He's not going to play for long.“
He's a tireless... grottman.

69
00:09:01,301 --> 00:09:04,753
What is grottman in Finnish?
-A caveman.

70
00:09:13,229 --> 00:09:17,904
It sounded really good.
You've always had good drum sounds.

71
00:09:18,026 --> 00:09:20,600
That's right.
- Is this the old drum set?

72
00:09:22,197 --> 00:09:26,622
Stina asked me...
or rather told me to ask you -

73
00:09:26,826 --> 00:09:29,330
when are you going to begin
your work?

74
00:09:29,621 --> 00:09:32,504
Is this a labour camp?
- Of course not.

75
00:09:32,707 --> 00:09:36,883
No pressure from me.
- How much will you pay me?

76
00:09:37,003 --> 00:09:40,420
Of course we'll pay you.
what is your hourly rate?

77
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:45,300
Do you think I'm gonna count hours?
- Of course not.

78
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:49,516
It's a thousand euros a day. In cash.
- That's quite a lot.

79
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:56,222
Hey, come on, compadre.
Your old lady is loaded.

80
00:10:00,068 --> 00:10:02,358
What are these fucking slimeballs?

81
00:10:03,446 --> 00:10:06,899
It's scallop pasta.
- It's shit, you trollop!

82
00:10:07,075 --> 00:10:11,121
I want shepherd's pie and sausages
before I starve to death.

83
00:10:11,204 --> 00:10:13,957
And bring me the hard stuff.

84
00:10:15,667 --> 00:10:18,301
On the double!

85
00:10:20,213 --> 00:10:23,844
Hey, Monkki. Have some mercy.
-"Have some mercy."

86
00:10:24,009 --> 00:10:27,805
Give me some sub.
I want an advance on wages.

87
00:10:28,013 --> 00:10:33,695
...5,800, 5,900, 6,000.

88
00:10:34,853 --> 00:10:39,397
Is the lodge going to be ready
in time for our crayfish party?

89
00:10:43,611 --> 00:10:46,815
I have a couple of
wallpaper choices.

90
00:10:49,492 --> 00:10:52,530
Give me the booze.

91
00:11:22,901 --> 00:11:26,531
Now he stopped.
- I'm scared.

92
00:11:27,614 --> 00:11:32,443
You är going to Helsinki tomorrow.
I'm stuck here with that monkey man.

93
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:40,009
Everything's going to be okay.

94
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:04,309
Did it go through?

95
00:12:04,526 --> 00:12:07,409
What? Are you shagging?

96
00:12:07,654 --> 00:12:09,873
Yuck.

97
00:12:26,673 --> 00:12:28,713
<i>It burns!</i>

98
00:12:30,176 --> 00:12:32,561
<i>My arse is on fire!</i>

99
00:13:10,175 --> 00:13:12,809
<i>Toni Paatelainen. Leave a message.</i>

100
00:13:12,969 --> 00:13:16,386
It's <i>jag.</i> Listen, Tomi...

101
00:13:17,098 --> 00:13:20,800
Mähönen was in our toilet.
Luckily, he's gone now.

102
00:13:20,894 --> 00:13:25,888
He took our money.
I hope he's not coming tillbaka.

103
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:35,411
What's the matter, Stina?
Are you ill?

104
00:13:35,533 --> 00:13:38,167
No, everything's fine.

105
00:13:57,389 --> 00:13:59,548
Let's play "Wild Beast".

106
00:14:52,986 --> 00:14:56,533
Amazing women by the sea!

107
00:15:05,707 --> 00:15:09,848
Do you have any Coca-Cola?
I can't drink this straight.

108
00:15:16,134 --> 00:15:19,586
Stina, they're really nice guys.

109
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:26,388
Gerhard Rihmakallo is
a German mushroom expert -

110
00:15:27,228 --> 00:15:29,483
who moved to Finland in the '80s.

111
00:15:29,648 --> 00:15:32,436
His real name is
Gerhard ScheiBenhaus.

112
00:15:32,567 --> 00:15:35,071
He's the king of riffs.

113
00:15:37,238 --> 00:15:40,584
And the singer,
David Foster aka Tapio Mäkinen -

114
00:15:40,659 --> 00:15:43,127
is my old schoolmate.

115
00:15:43,286 --> 00:15:48,210
He's working for the municipality of
Tyrnävä, marking baseball lines.

116
00:15:50,669 --> 00:15:56,186
How do you know them?
- They are Cobra.

117
00:15:59,219 --> 00:16:03,134
Gerhard, you're the brains
in your band.

118
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:05,774
You seem like an intelligent man.

119
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:10,657
Do you understand Swedish?
Talar du svenska?

120
00:16:12,565 --> 00:16:15,104
Okay, let's try German.

121
00:16:43,054 --> 00:16:44,775
<i>Hjälp!-'</i>

122
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:08,756
This is a new song,
"David's On Fire".

123
00:17:09,289 --> 00:17:12,741
It begins with a massive guitar riff.

124
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:17,007
The drumming begins with a gong.
And it's awesome -

125
00:17:17,213 --> 00:17:20,002
to have our bassist playing with us.

126
00:18:21,361 --> 00:18:26,534
Now the going's so good
that I could use a beer.

127
00:18:26,783 --> 00:18:34,281
Välkommen to our traditional
crayfish party here in Kallvik.

128
00:18:34,582 --> 00:18:39,542
I have invited a couple of important
co-operation partners to join us.

129
00:18:39,671 --> 00:18:42,424
Here's a film director
and my dear friend -

130
00:18:42,507 --> 00:18:45,639
<i>Kurt “KurreKurre” von Riikonen.</i>

131
00:18:45,802 --> 00:18:51,817
Maybe you could say something about
your fantastic new film, Excalibur}.

132
00:18:53,435 --> 00:18:55,345
Four.

133
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:05,368
The film's genre is not just sci-fi.
There's also a dash of fantasy.

134
00:19:06,072 --> 00:19:08,825
And here's my dear vän-

135
00:19:09,284 --> 00:19:14,172
the editor-in-chief of
The Sensationalist, Julle Rekola.

136
00:19:17,917 --> 00:19:22,627
I've had a gay old time with Julle.
Our co-operation has been great.

137
00:19:22,839 --> 00:19:26,541
Kalle, Kurre and everyone -

138
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:30,936
it's always a great pleasure
to be with real men's men -

139
00:19:32,015 --> 00:19:35,811
whether on land, sea or air.

140
00:19:36,686 --> 00:19:39,783
Skål, everyone. To crayfish.

141
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:03,414
Now I feel we should play "Lizard".

142
00:20:11,429 --> 00:20:13,755
What the helvete is this?

143
00:20:40,125 --> 00:20:43,791
Who the hell are you?

144
00:20:44,462 --> 00:20:46,598
You have no...

145
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:50,058
Hey, Swede. Shut the fuck up.

146
00:20:50,176 --> 00:20:55,385
Didn't you hear what David said?
He said "hush".

147
00:20:56,057 --> 00:20:59,973
David, go ahead.
- Gerhard, you had something to say.

148
00:21:00,103 --> 00:21:04,647
Go ahead, Gerhard.
- Let's play "Fireball".

149
00:21:18,913 --> 00:21:23,493
My darling <i>lilla</i> Stina will now come
with me to talk about your future.

150
00:21:23,626 --> 00:21:28,301
And I'm going to give the Excalibur
poster to a good graphic designer.

151
00:21:28,798 --> 00:21:32,085
And Tomi... You're fired.

152
00:21:32,344 --> 00:21:36,733
You have two days
to get rid of that riffraff.

153
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:55,492
<i>Drink some water.
Now we're going to calm down...</i>

154
00:22:15,345 --> 00:22:17,421
what are you thinking?

155
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:20,964
My wife's gone.

156
00:22:22,727 --> 00:22:27,058
Don't you worry.
Now we can practice in peace.

157
00:22:28,316 --> 00:22:32,267
Look, it's Leather Jaska,
Mullethead and Stud.

158
00:22:32,779 --> 00:22:35,318
But where's Spunk?

159
00:22:35,532 --> 00:22:38,794
There he is! Spunk is coming!

160
00:22:43,289 --> 00:22:47,750
TWO DAYS LATER

161
00:23:00,724 --> 00:23:03,357
<i>what the helvete?!</i>

162
00:23:03,435 --> 00:23:07,385
They're just setting up the gear.
The party is tomorrow.

163
00:23:31,171 --> 00:23:34,054
Hey, this guy is causing trouble.

164
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:41,940
Kalle, you're running wild.
why are you rampaging?

165
00:23:42,015 --> 00:23:45,776
What is happening here?
- The guys are setting up the gear.

166
00:23:45,894 --> 00:23:50,438
Cobra is playing tomorrow.
- It'll attract over 600 people.

167
00:23:50,523 --> 00:23:53,620
Cobra's concert?
- You're dumb as a doorknob.

168
00:23:53,777 --> 00:23:56,245
This is a great place.

169
00:23:56,404 --> 00:24:00,165
Rihmakallo said this point of land
is made for festivals.

170
00:24:00,241 --> 00:24:04,821
Just add parking, tents,
the stage and a bar.

171
00:24:04,954 --> 00:24:10,377
When we cut down those trees,
there's room for 15 to 20,000 people.

172
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:12,679
A festival? 50,000 people?

173
00:24:12,837 --> 00:24:17,547
The lodge could be used as a jail.
Do you want to go to jail, Kalle?

174
00:24:17,926 --> 00:24:20,714
Cow... I mean Stina.
-Vad?What?

175
00:24:20,804 --> 00:24:25,443
Why are you always so tense?
You're whining day and night.

176
00:24:26,935 --> 00:24:29,343
Tomi is a bass artist.

177
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:34,775
And don't you worry about
the renovation. Spunk will handle it.

178
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:39,441
I don't have time to do it.
I'm a percussion instrument artist.

179
00:24:39,906 --> 00:24:45,921
Are you going to live here?
- Absolutely not.

180
00:24:46,037 --> 00:24:50,368
Maybe during the summer
and the Christmas season.

181
00:24:54,337 --> 00:24:59,961
Tomi?
- Sorry, baby. This is the real me.

182
00:25:09,352 --> 00:25:13,564
You're not coming here.

183
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:16,443
Go away and come back tomorrow.

184
00:25:16,526 --> 00:25:21,414
Shay what you want. We're coming in.
- No, you're not. Shtay away.

185
00:25:22,907 --> 00:25:28,839
Are you making fun of my lishp?
-of courshe not. Shtay away.

186
00:25:28,997 --> 00:25:32,544
He's making fun of you.
- Are you making fun of my lishp?

187
00:25:32,667 --> 00:25:36,499
He's making fun of Jouni.
- Wanna get your head smashed in?

188
00:25:39,716 --> 00:25:44,794
I'll wipe that shmile off your face.
- Please, go away.

189
00:25:45,555 --> 00:25:50,230
He's afraid of you.
- Attack!

190
00:25:51,770 --> 00:25:54,973
Have a gingerbread ice cream.
- I don't like them.

191
00:25:55,106 --> 00:25:59,816
Have an ice jolly.
- That's not real ice cream.

192
00:26:02,322 --> 00:26:06,498
Everyone getsh a choc ice.

193
00:26:08,244 --> 00:26:11,661
I want a choc ice.
- I'll have the same.

194
00:26:13,541 --> 00:26:16,828
Me too.
- And me.

195
00:26:18,588 --> 00:26:23,393
One choc ice, please.
- What has happened to you, Risto?

196
00:26:24,010 --> 00:26:26,514
I fell off my moped in a bend.

197
00:26:27,138 --> 00:26:31,018
One choc ice, please.
- You have a black eye and bruises.

198
00:26:31,184 --> 00:26:34,886
I fell off in the same bend.
-One choc ice, please.

199
00:26:35,063 --> 00:26:38,100
Pentti, did you crash your ATV
in the same bend?

200
00:26:38,233 --> 00:26:40,950
Yeah, it was a pile-up.

201
00:26:42,404 --> 00:26:46,485
It must be one slippery bend.
- One choc ice, please.

202
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:50,247
Jarmo, I guess you crashed
your moped in the same bend.

203
00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:54,380
No, we got our arses kicked
by a group of heavy metal roadies.

204
00:26:54,541 --> 00:27:00,627
We didn't manage
to throw even one punch. Bye.

205
00:27:00,964 --> 00:27:06,765
The men in our village...
-Risto is ugly and stupid.

206
00:27:06,928 --> 00:27:10,808
Pentti is fat.
Antti is just super annoying.

207
00:27:10,932 --> 00:27:14,598
I bet they're all virgins.
- And then there's Jouni.

208
00:27:16,563 --> 00:27:20,075
A pathetic splutterer.
- Thinks he's the leader.

209
00:27:20,191 --> 00:27:24,332
Have you noticed how he looks at you?
- But he's really small.

210
00:27:24,446 --> 00:27:29,025
Could you imagine being with him?
- Not even if he was the last man.

211
00:27:29,159 --> 00:27:34,296
Take a look at their little thingies.
They're just a bunch of buffoons.

212
00:27:41,254 --> 00:27:44,042
I'm not buying anything
from thish shop.

213
00:27:48,762 --> 00:27:51,396
Jouni, why didn't you buy ice cream?

214
00:27:52,557 --> 00:27:56,769
I'll put plenty of sausages
in your fresh sausage soup.

215
00:27:59,397 --> 00:28:02,494
That's nice. I like lumpsh.

216
00:28:02,734 --> 00:28:05,237
COMEDY, DRAMA
CRIME

217
00:28:08,782 --> 00:28:12,543
Don't watch your films until dawn.

218
00:28:12,786 --> 00:28:16,048
Then you'll just snooze
till afternoon.

219
00:28:16,206 --> 00:28:20,951
<i>What is that movie called?
-Shpiderman 3.</i>

220
00:28:51,533 --> 00:28:55,163
Risto, be careful with those.
Jouni is calling.

221
00:28:57,247 --> 00:28:58,837
<i>Antti.
-where are you?</i>

222
00:28:58,999 --> 00:29:00,660
What?
-where are you?

223
00:29:01,001 --> 00:29:05,331
We're watching Pentti's dad's cows.
- Come to the Shkull Cave.

224
00:29:05,964 --> 00:29:07,720
Okay.)'-

225
00:29:11,511 --> 00:29:14,264
We're going to rob
jushtiina's shop.

226
00:29:14,389 --> 00:29:17,806
What?
- We're going to rob Jushtiina's shop.

227
00:29:17,976 --> 00:29:21,262
All the cash and tenderloinsh.
- Why?

228
00:29:21,604 --> 00:29:24,179
Becaushe they're fucking with ush.

229
00:29:25,525 --> 00:29:28,907
It's an impossible mission.
- I have a plan.

230
00:29:29,404 --> 00:29:34,149
Justiina is going to kill us.
- What is this plan of yours?

231
00:29:36,411 --> 00:29:41,868
You've all sheen Harrishon Ford in
Witnessh with those Amish guysh.

232
00:29:42,459 --> 00:29:46,919
<i>Me and Antti will go to Justiina's
shop dressed ash the Amish.</i>

233
00:29:48,673 --> 00:29:54,060
<i>We'll shurvey the shecurity shystems.
There are two shurveillance camerash.</i>

234
00:29:55,430 --> 00:30:00,069
<i>A shecurity guard visitsh jushtiina's
shop at leasht once a day.</i>

235
00:30:00,352 --> 00:30:04,302
<i>He enters through the back door
which has a double padlock.</i>

236
00:30:04,564 --> 00:30:09,702
That's a tricky one. But the shop
has a weak point: the tin roof.

237
00:30:10,737 --> 00:30:14,996
The ceiling is made of shoft
Haltex panelsh. Passh it around.

238
00:30:17,077 --> 00:30:21,372
We're entering through the ceiling.
-justiina will strangle us.

239
00:30:21,539 --> 00:30:25,300
We need a wild bunch.
Shpecialists!

240
00:30:25,543 --> 00:30:30,182
Shteven Sheagal, Shylvester
Shtallone, Charlesh Bronson and...

241
00:30:31,466 --> 00:30:33,851
...Telly Shavalash!

242
00:30:34,094 --> 00:30:36,941
Where are you going, Rishto?
- Mealtime.

243
00:30:37,055 --> 00:30:40,935
It's my mealtime, too.
- I'm going for a swim.

244
00:30:41,601 --> 00:30:43,677
Let's go, boys.

245
00:30:47,524 --> 00:30:51,949
Jouni, you have been
in your own world recently.

246
00:30:52,862 --> 00:30:55,188
What do you mean?

247
00:30:55,949 --> 00:30:59,496
You haven't mown the lawn
or chopped firewood.

248
00:31:00,829 --> 00:31:03,332
And you should clean your room.

249
00:31:04,749 --> 00:31:08,925
This morning,
you didn't ﬂush the toilet.

250
00:31:10,171 --> 00:31:15,510
Shorry.
- Here's a cucumber sandwich.

251
00:31:15,719 --> 00:31:20,642
Thanksh.
- Don't watch films all day.

252
00:31:23,059 --> 00:31:25,729
What is this movie called?

253
00:32:07,479 --> 00:32:10,267
Jouni is calling. Antti.

254
00:32:10,357 --> 00:32:12,682
<i>Where are you?
-On the beach.</i>

255
00:32:12,776 --> 00:32:16,442
<i>Immediately to the Shkull Cave.
-But</i> I <i>haven't swum yet.</i>

256
00:32:16,571 --> 00:32:19,585
Okay. To the Skull Cave.

257
00:32:19,658 --> 00:32:22,126
I haven't swum yet.
- Now.

258
00:32:41,179 --> 00:32:43,848
Boysh, do you know what these are?

259
00:32:44,599 --> 00:32:47,138
Rishto.
- They look like suction caps.

260
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:53,266
Me and jarmo will climb onto the roof
ushing shuction cupsh.

261
00:32:54,484 --> 00:32:58,696
Seems quite difficult.
- What do you mean "difficult"?

262
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:03,610
The wall is not smooth.
The suction cups won't work.

263
00:33:04,244 --> 00:33:07,257
<i>They don't adhere
to a porous surface.</i>

264
00:33:09,541 --> 00:33:12,115
<i>Bugger. Ish that she?</i>

265
00:33:14,087 --> 00:33:18,892
jarmo, why are you naked?
- I left my swimming trunks at home.

266
00:33:19,009 --> 00:33:23,837
But why are you naked?
- I told him to swim in his underwear.

267
00:33:23,972 --> 00:33:26,819
He didn't have any,
so he swam in his shorts.

268
00:33:26,975 --> 00:33:31,365
The shorts came off because
the elastic band was too loose -

269
00:33:31,479 --> 00:33:34,054
and he had his keys in his pocket.

270
00:33:34,149 --> 00:33:37,910
Why are you jumping, jarmo?
- I have water in my ear.

271
00:33:40,155 --> 00:33:43,002
Blimey, jarmo is jumping.

272
00:33:43,992 --> 00:33:49,046
So?
- It's whatchamacallit... Parkour!

273
00:33:49,247 --> 00:33:52,285
What's that?
-It's city jumping.

274
00:33:52,417 --> 00:33:55,834
You've seen <i>it in</i> Casino Royale.

275
00:33:56,004 --> 00:33:59,635
<i>I'm going to jump like a brown hare
onto the tin roof.</i>

276
00:33:59,799 --> 00:34:02,967
<i>Then I'll throw a rope to jarmo.</i>

277
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:07,941
jarmo is not able to climb the wall.
- He's going to climb the wall.

278
00:34:11,394 --> 00:34:14,182
Now my ear is empty.

279
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:20,327
<i>We'll cut a hole in the tin roof with
a shide grinder and lower me inshide.</i>

280
00:34:20,528 --> 00:34:25,333
How do you get electricity?
- Good point. Let me think.

281
00:34:25,533 --> 00:34:30,671
We can borrow my dad's generator.
- We'll use a generator.

282
00:34:31,748 --> 00:34:35,035
<i>Then we can ushe the grinder-</i>

283
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:39,090
<i>to cut a hole for me.</i>

284
00:34:44,886 --> 00:34:48,588
<i>The ceiling is
a piece of cake for me.</i>

285
00:34:49,057 --> 00:34:52,640
Then I'll lower myself
into jushtiina's shop.

286
00:34:56,064 --> 00:34:59,979
But you said that there are
two surveillance cameras.

287
00:35:00,527 --> 00:35:03,659
Bugger. That's a good point.

288
00:35:04,781 --> 00:35:07,569
What are we going to do now?

289
00:35:08,326 --> 00:35:11,957
When are we going to go
to the shop dressed as the Amish?

290
00:35:12,038 --> 00:35:15,740
Go swimming.
Fish out Jarmo's shorts -

291
00:35:15,875 --> 00:35:18,545
and the Shkull Cave's shpare key.

292
00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:22,585
Happy Birthday, Jouni.
Have some cake.

293
00:35:22,716 --> 00:35:25,184
Sit down. I'll take a picture.

294
00:35:25,302 --> 00:35:30,688
49 years. when you turn fifty,
we'll cut those sideburns.

295
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:34,767
No way. I'd look stupid.

296
00:35:41,067 --> 00:35:42,609
<i>Mat“.
-Where are you?</i>

297
00:35:42,694 --> 00:35:46,206
We're driving dougnuts.
-To the Shkull <i>Cave.</i>

298
00:35:46,323 --> 00:35:50,273
But I haven't driven the lawnmower.
- Now!

299
00:35:50,410 --> 00:35:52,249
Okay.)'-

300
00:35:53,204 --> 00:35:55,613
To the Skull Cave!

301
00:36:00,253 --> 00:36:03,291
Rishto,
you'll go to Jushtiina's shop-

302
00:36:03,548 --> 00:36:08,377
<i>and take a photo of the area where
the shurveillance camera ish pointed.</i>

303
00:36:09,387 --> 00:36:11,606
The camera records in B & W -

304
00:36:11,723 --> 00:36:16,303
<i>so you musht develop a B & W photo
in a dark room.</i>

305
00:36:16,394 --> 00:36:18,779
Then you'll build a mount-

306
00:36:18,897 --> 00:36:24,663
and shecretly hang your photograph -

307
00:36:24,778 --> 00:36:30,235
<i>in front of the shurveillance camera.</i>

308
00:36:31,493 --> 00:36:35,788
But I haven't got a camera.
And how do we find a dark room?

309
00:36:37,791 --> 00:36:42,050
Why are you like that?
Don't be like that!

310
00:36:42,545 --> 00:36:45,559
We'll fool the shurveillance camera -

311
00:36:45,715 --> 00:36:48,848
sho that I can be lowered
into the store.

312
00:36:48,969 --> 00:36:52,730
But what if the security guard
is in the shop?

313
00:36:54,224 --> 00:36:57,392
What then?
- What are we going to do now?

314
00:37:02,941 --> 00:37:07,236
Pentti, Antti, Rishto and jarmo,
why are you messhing with me?

315
00:37:07,404 --> 00:37:11,912
Jouni, you are messing with us.
- Pentti is right.

316
00:37:12,075 --> 00:37:16,156
You have a short fuse.
- A short fushe!

317
00:37:18,206 --> 00:37:23,130
Fushe... I figured out how to
get rid of the shecurity guard.

318
00:37:23,253 --> 00:37:26,599
Pentti, you know how to weld.
- Yeah.

319
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:31,932
Your mother is coming, Jouni.
Terttu is coming.

320
00:37:35,932 --> 00:37:38,780
I brought you
marble cake and squash.

321
00:37:41,521 --> 00:37:44,025
What are you planning, boys?

322
00:37:44,733 --> 00:37:49,372
Are you up to your tricks again?
- Of course not.

323
00:37:49,529 --> 00:37:51,914
You're such nice boys.

324
00:37:52,699 --> 00:37:57,208
Goodbye.
- Thanks for the cake, Terttu.

325
00:37:57,370 --> 00:37:59,755
Thanks.
- Thanks, Terttu.

326
00:38:00,332 --> 00:38:04,093
Pentti, you can weld the shop's
back door shut.

327
00:38:05,503 --> 00:38:11,091
<i>The shecurity guard can't get in
becaushe the door is welded shut</i> -

328
00:38:11,176 --> 00:38:12,837
<i>and he goesh home.</i>

329
00:38:13,011 --> 00:38:19,346
And then I can get inshide
jushtiina's village shop.

330
00:38:19,809 --> 00:38:24,270
<i>You haven't taken into account
that Justiina might be in her shop.</i>

331
00:38:29,069 --> 00:38:30,101
Shit.

332
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,325
<i>Jouni!
-Yea h?</i>

333
00:38:32,447 --> 00:38:36,327
<i>Your egg sandwich is on the table.
Good night.</i>

334
00:38:37,327 --> 00:38:40,839
<i>What are you watching?
- All the Batmanfilmsh.</i>

335
00:38:46,002 --> 00:38:50,178
It's Jouni. Antti.
- Where are you?

336
00:38:50,298 --> 00:38:53,585
I'm at home, in bed.
- To the Shkull Cave!

337
00:38:57,013 --> 00:39:01,094
What about Rishto, Pentti and jarmo?
- They're not coming.

338
00:39:01,267 --> 00:39:04,815
They said they no longer
want to be involved.

339
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:07,139
Why not?

340
00:39:07,732 --> 00:39:12,537
Pentti doesn't want to borrow
his dad's generator all the time.

341
00:39:13,363 --> 00:39:18,441
Jarmo is afraid of the side grinder
and the dark room confuses Risto.

342
00:39:19,577 --> 00:39:24,631
Then they said you boss around
and don't listen to their ideas.

343
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:28,159
But they don't have any ideas.

344
00:39:28,336 --> 00:39:31,504
Risto meant that if they had ideas.

345
00:39:34,926 --> 00:39:37,880
What about you?
- I have nothing else.

346
00:39:39,514 --> 00:39:41,650
Jouni?
- What?

347
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,760
What does "Amish" mean?

348
00:40:09,294 --> 00:40:11,548
Come here, boysh.

349
00:40:13,548 --> 00:40:17,594
<i>“Mo, do you know 'aha
Tupshu shim about yen'!?</i>

350
00:40:17,927 --> 00:40:21,214
No.
- She shaid that you're shtupid.

351
00:40:21,681 --> 00:40:23,651
That's right.

352
00:40:24,059 --> 00:40:29,931
Guess what she shaid about you,
Rishto? She shaid you're a virgin.

353
00:40:30,523 --> 00:40:32,564
That's right.

354
00:40:33,276 --> 00:40:36,539
Guess what she shaid about you,
Pentti?

355
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:41,419
She shaid that you're
a four-eyed fatsho.

356
00:40:41,576 --> 00:40:46,286
Really?
-justiina made fun of our rides.

357
00:40:46,456 --> 00:40:50,881
What? That's a bit rich!
These aren't even finished yet.

358
00:40:51,252 --> 00:40:54,705
<i>Hum 'x .
' “M- Mn“.!</i>

359
00:41:09,854 --> 00:41:14,814
<i>1 want to be Shteven Sheagal
-1 want to be Steven Seagal</i>

360
00:41:14,943 --> 00:41:19,772
<i>I don't want to be Richard Gere
-1 don't want to be Richard Gere</i>

361
00:41:19,906 --> 00:41:24,984
<i>1 want to be Schwarzenegger
-I want to be Schwarzenegger</i>

362
00:41:25,078 --> 00:41:29,539
<i>who wantsh to be Hugh Grant?
-Nobody! Nobody!</i>

363
00:41:30,583 --> 00:41:33,301
You know that
justiina is talking crap.

364
00:41:33,378 --> 00:41:36,047
I'm pretty sure
that I'm not a virgin.

365
00:41:36,506 --> 00:41:39,140
And Pentti is not fat.
He is just heavy.

366
00:41:39,801 --> 00:41:43,681
When we have robbed
jushtiina's shop-

367
00:41:43,763 --> 00:41:47,429
jushtiina's and Tupshu's livesh
will go down the drain.

368
00:41:47,517 --> 00:41:51,777
They'll have to file for pershonal
bankruptcy. They'll be poor.

369
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:58,247
And they will both be
begging ush for shex.

370
00:42:02,115 --> 00:42:04,749
Yes, where wash I?

371
00:42:04,993 --> 00:42:09,537
We have eliminated the camerash,
out-faxed the shecurity guard -

372
00:42:10,123 --> 00:42:14,703
and now I can once again
lower myself into jushtiina's shop.

373
00:42:14,878 --> 00:42:18,330
Jouni...
- What ish it?

374
00:42:18,423 --> 00:42:22,564
What about Justiina and Tupsu?
They're in the shop.

375
00:42:22,677 --> 00:42:27,008
Pentti, the answer is Antti.
- Antti?

376
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:29,050
Antti.
- What?

377
00:42:29,434 --> 00:42:34,488
<i>We 'll shpray Antti with self-tanning
lotion and greashe him up.</i>

378
00:42:34,606 --> 00:42:37,240
He'll be our decoy.
- What does it mean?

379
00:42:37,442 --> 00:42:39,732
A shtool pigeon.

380
00:42:39,819 --> 00:42:43,486
<i>While Antti flexes his musclesh
like Schwarzenegger-</i>

381
00:42:43,573 --> 00:42:47,334
I'm going to rob Jushtiina's shop.

382
00:42:47,661 --> 00:42:53,427
Any questionsh?
- Sounds good.

383
00:42:55,794 --> 00:43:00,373
Here are your costumes
for the youth society's masked ball.

384
00:43:00,465 --> 00:43:03,182
I don't want to go
to a masked ball.

385
00:43:03,301 --> 00:43:06,967
You're going.
These are our costumes.

386
00:43:08,723 --> 00:43:12,804
Oh, that's right.
- But they're not black.

387
00:43:12,894 --> 00:43:15,908
I think black
is such a depressing colour.

388
00:43:16,022 --> 00:43:19,653
And what colour did you ushe?
- Different colours.

389
00:43:23,071 --> 00:43:27,745
Bloody hell.
I guess we'll have to wear these.

390
00:43:43,717 --> 00:43:46,185
Now it begins.

391
00:43:46,761 --> 00:43:53,097
Antti, have I been all keyed up?
- It's nothing. Don't worry.

392
00:43:53,184 --> 00:43:56,851
Jouni, what are we going to do?
- Don't ashk me.

393
00:43:57,022 --> 00:43:59,406
Antti?

394
00:43:59,899 --> 00:44:02,569
Men, attack!

395
00:44:15,457 --> 00:44:20,036
Kalle, is the drummer and his band
Cobra still living in the villa?

396
00:44:20,211 --> 00:44:24,352
No, they're on tour, in Germany.

397
00:44:24,883 --> 00:44:28,300
When will I get the Excalibur poster?

398
00:44:28,428 --> 00:44:31,940
It's on its way.
just a little longer.

399
00:44:32,682 --> 00:44:36,692
Julle, how is The Sensationalist
involved in the marketing?

400
00:44:36,895 --> 00:44:40,561
I've been thinking about
a hunting trip.

401
00:44:40,690 --> 00:44:44,107
Let's go and shoot
a shitload of bears.

402
00:44:44,611 --> 00:44:49,119
We can do a story about the makers of
Excalibur hunting bears.

403
00:44:52,869 --> 00:44:57,010
Pentti! Oh my God!
- Do you see that?

404
00:44:57,457 --> 00:45:01,918
What the helvete?
- What is this circus?

405
00:45:02,879 --> 00:45:05,548
Wait a moment.
I'll take some pictures.

406
00:45:06,466 --> 00:45:12,089
Erkki "Slop Bucket" Sysimetsä,
this is how we sell magazines.

407
00:45:12,263 --> 00:45:15,467
Beginner's luck.
You just happened to be there.

408
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:18,483
Don't you get smart with me.

409
00:45:18,728 --> 00:45:24,067
You're writing stories about
Keijo-Sinikka's summer cottage.

410
00:45:24,526 --> 00:45:28,666
Sinikka has a gold record.
- In the seventies, Sysimetsä!

411
00:45:28,780 --> 00:45:32,197
1973.
-You write too much.

412
00:45:32,283 --> 00:45:36,792
People want pictures. Here are some
pictures. Look and learn.

413
00:45:37,455 --> 00:45:41,596
This arsehole is Antti Peräkorpi.
He was flexing his muscles -

414
00:45:41,668 --> 00:45:43,958
to lure the shop assistants out.

415
00:45:44,129 --> 00:45:48,957
This is Pentti Alakarvasto. He was
supposed to weld the back door shut -

416
00:45:49,092 --> 00:45:52,260
but a spark lit him up.

417
00:45:52,470 --> 00:45:54,310
This is Risto Näre.

418
00:45:54,472 --> 00:45:59,550
He was supposed to fool the
surveillance camera with a photo.

419
00:45:59,769 --> 00:46:04,574
This is jarmo Komulainen. They
managed to cut a hole in the roof -

420
00:46:04,733 --> 00:46:06,892
but Komulainen got stuck.

421
00:46:07,193 --> 00:46:11,369
This guy is
the "brains" of the outfit.

422
00:46:11,489 --> 00:46:17,113
Jouni Hirvi had a panic attack
and cried for his mummy in a ditch.

423
00:46:17,287 --> 00:46:20,324
I got the best material -

424
00:46:20,623 --> 00:46:23,471
when the shopkeeper
justiina found out-

425
00:46:23,585 --> 00:46:26,539
that these nitwits
tried to rob her shop.

426
00:46:26,713 --> 00:46:32,764
Look at this shit.
I just had to start shooting video.

427
00:46:33,053 --> 00:46:36,090
The images are moving.
- This is a YouTube hit.

428
00:46:36,264 --> 00:46:41,567
What will happen to those guys?
will they do time?

429
00:46:41,686 --> 00:46:45,352
No, every talk show
wants to have them.

430
00:46:45,482 --> 00:46:50,476
They'll be touring in a helicopter
and releasing records and books.

431
00:46:50,654 --> 00:46:55,458
Jouni got excited when he heard that
they're making a film based on them.

432
00:46:55,533 --> 00:46:59,235
You're fired!
Stide, is the fake tits here?

433
00:46:59,329 --> 00:47:01,583
What?
- Is the fake tits here?

434
00:47:01,748 --> 00:47:04,845
There she is. Where's Thomas?
- Julle.

435
00:47:05,335 --> 00:47:10,579
There's a slight problem with my
costume. I don't have the sword...

436
00:47:10,715 --> 00:47:14,417
Kalle!
- <i>Vad</i> is it?

437
00:47:14,511 --> 00:47:18,462
Stide is going to take pictures
of fake tits and Thomas.

438
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:23,149
Then Stide will send them to me
and I will publish them.

439
00:47:23,269 --> 00:47:26,153
Okay. Go, go, go.

440
00:47:29,275 --> 00:47:33,155
Did you say that I'm fired?

441
00:47:35,615 --> 00:47:41,547
Listen to me, Julle. I began to write
for The Sensationalist in the '60s...

442
00:47:41,663 --> 00:47:44,451
Shut up. You're fired.

443
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,752
Now! Get the fuck out of here.

444
00:47:47,961 --> 00:47:50,369
Get out of this building.

445
00:48:11,443 --> 00:48:14,729
Listen... Hey, listen!

446
00:48:15,488 --> 00:48:20,542
Do you remember...
of course not.

447
00:48:21,995 --> 00:48:27,132
But listen... One sunny morning,
about fifty years ago -

448
00:48:27,292 --> 00:48:32,915
I was on my way to The Sensationalist
offices for the very first time.

449
00:48:33,590 --> 00:48:37,849
<i>It was spring.
The air was oozing with eroticism.</i>

450
00:48:41,139 --> 00:48:44,426
<i>Urpo Lehtinen
was the editor-in-chief.</i>

451
00:48:44,643 --> 00:48:48,344
<i>He gave me the nickname
"Slop Bucket'.</i>

452
00:48:48,688 --> 00:48:53,991
<i>Urpo told me to write a feature
about the sinful Finnish summer.</i>

453
00:48:56,237 --> 00:48:59,785
<i>At the same time,
organ repairman Arvo Hakala -</i>

454
00:48:59,866 --> 00:49:03,627
<i>was leaving his dog
with his neighbour for the summer.</i>

455
00:49:03,745 --> 00:49:06,782
Thank you, Alma.
Have a nice summer.

456
00:49:06,915 --> 00:49:10,747
Arvo, try to leave the ladies alone.

457
00:49:11,169 --> 00:49:14,372
Otherwise, there'll be hell to pay.
- Of course.

458
00:49:14,589 --> 00:49:16,749
Bye.
- Bye.

459
00:49:16,966 --> 00:49:20,063
Well, hello Seija.

460
00:49:20,679 --> 00:49:23,846
You're still delivering the post.

461
00:49:37,904 --> 00:49:41,819
What is our route?
- First to Alahärmä. A tuning job.

462
00:49:42,784 --> 00:49:45,797
Then to Ylihärmä'.
An organ needs servicing.

463
00:49:45,954 --> 00:49:51,577
The B-foot and 16-foot pipe valves
are stuck -

464
00:49:51,710 --> 00:49:54,498
and the woodpipes are clogged up.

465
00:49:54,671 --> 00:49:57,625
There's a full renovation job
in Köyrä.

466
00:49:59,592 --> 00:50:04,552
In Köyrä...
we've never been to Köyrä.

467
00:50:04,681 --> 00:50:08,691
First we'll take a pump organ
to Nurmo.

468
00:50:09,519 --> 00:50:12,556
To Nurmo? The school of Ala-Yrvä?

469
00:50:13,315 --> 00:50:15,533
Helena is there.
- Yes, she is.

470
00:50:35,754 --> 00:50:42,564
<i>Each tiny floweret whispers
the great life-givers name</i>

471
00:50:43,094 --> 00:50:45,882
I have brought you an organ.

472
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:51,468
Thank you, children.
You can go home already.

473
00:50:51,728 --> 00:50:55,987
I have other things to do.

474
00:50:56,191 --> 00:51:01,020
It's wonderful that you're here.
But what if the headmaster comes?

475
00:51:01,196 --> 00:51:06,084
Helena, it's been an eternity
since I last kissed your lips -

476
00:51:06,618 --> 00:51:09,252
felt your sensitive bosom -

477
00:51:09,329 --> 00:51:12,912
and caressed
the soft skin of your buttocks.

478
00:51:18,046 --> 00:51:21,878
It's not the headmaster
who will come soon.

479
00:51:42,988 --> 00:51:45,313
Helena?

480
00:51:45,490 --> 00:51:49,287
<i>The pump</i> organ is <i>working now.
- Thank you, Yrjö'.</i>

481
00:51:49,494 --> 00:51:51,998
Thank you.
- Yrjö

482
00:51:52,163 --> 00:51:54,382
<i>Yes'!
-This will take a moment.</i>

483
00:51:54,833 --> 00:51:57,621
Okay, I'll wait for you in the car.

484
00:51:59,295 --> 00:52:01,550
Helena?
- Yes?

485
00:52:01,673 --> 00:52:04,627
Have a nice summer.
-Likewise.

486
00:52:18,398 --> 00:52:21,530
Where are you, Helena?

487
00:52:25,071 --> 00:52:28,903
Our pump organ
has been serviced.

488
00:52:29,326 --> 00:52:32,173
I must pump it immediately.

489
00:52:34,164 --> 00:52:37,510
What is that sound
coming from the map room?

490
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:44,088
Helena? Is something wrong?

491
00:52:54,184 --> 00:52:57,031
What a sight.

492
00:53:09,157 --> 00:53:14,544
Crikey, the pump organ repairman is
pumping Helena with his organ.

493
00:53:20,502 --> 00:53:23,349
It's as thick as a yardstick.

494
00:53:26,174 --> 00:53:29,211
Get a grip, Isotalo.

495
00:53:49,489 --> 00:53:52,835
<i>And so went the summer.</i>

496
00:53:52,993 --> 00:53:55,033
<i>Yrjö' drove the car -</i>

497
00:53:55,203 --> 00:53:59,249
<i>and Arvo drove women crazy.</i>

498
00:54:06,589 --> 00:54:09,378
Hello. Is something wrong?

499
00:54:09,801 --> 00:54:14,689
Hello. We have a flat tyre.
Do you happen to have a jack?

500
00:54:14,973 --> 00:54:19,019
Sure, we have a jack for you.

501
00:54:21,604 --> 00:54:25,745
I wonder if there are any
raspberries in the bushes?

502
00:54:26,609 --> 00:54:30,655
Let's check it out.
- Yes.

503
00:54:33,783 --> 00:54:36,916
I'm Wolf Scout leader
Peter Ramfeld.

504
00:54:37,078 --> 00:54:40,626
Heidi is a Bunny Scout leader
from Munkkiniemi.

505
00:54:41,458 --> 00:54:45,598
We were on our way to a jamboree,
when our tyre blew out.

506
00:54:46,463 --> 00:54:51,042
I'm a knot course instructor and
Heidi is running a first aid course.

507
00:54:53,261 --> 00:54:57,212
I might get to go to sauna
with Heidi tonight.

508
00:54:59,893 --> 00:55:03,559
What was that?
A badger? A pine marten?

509
00:55:03,730 --> 00:55:07,111
Sounds like it.
- That's not a pine marten.

510
00:55:07,317 --> 00:55:11,612
Maybe it's a rutting badger.
- That's not a badger.

511
00:55:11,780 --> 00:55:17,023
Was that all?
- Yes. Thanks for the help.

512
00:55:19,079 --> 00:55:22,033
Everyone's happy now.

513
00:55:23,208 --> 00:55:25,367
Get in the car, Heidi.

514
00:55:31,091 --> 00:55:33,499
Okay then...

515
00:55:36,221 --> 00:55:40,681
I had trouble writing my story -

516
00:55:40,850 --> 00:55:44,730
because I had been on a bender
the whole summer.

517
00:55:45,230 --> 00:55:50,189
I had been travelling around Finland
on The Sensationalist's tab -

518
00:55:50,402 --> 00:55:55,206
<i>and was stuck in a motel
somewhere in Northern Ostrobothnia.</i>

519
00:55:55,281 --> 00:55:57,915
<i>But one evening,
the action picked up.</i>

520
00:55:58,118 --> 00:56:03,255
<i>Two organ repairmen came in,
Yrjö Kortesmäki -</i>

521
00:56:03,373 --> 00:56:07,004
<i>and Arvo Hakala,
who was a superstud.</i>

522
00:56:11,339 --> 00:56:16,797
<i>Half an hour later, and the waitress
was ready and willing.</i>

523
00:56:18,555 --> 00:56:23,728
I never figured out why women
were interested in Hakala -

524
00:56:23,852 --> 00:56:27,138
<i>but the waitress was like putty
in his hands.</i>

525
00:56:27,272 --> 00:56:31,662
His singing sends butterflies
to my stomach.

526
00:56:38,199 --> 00:56:40,952
Oh dear me...
- What is it?

527
00:56:41,119 --> 00:56:43,587
Well...

528
00:56:43,872 --> 00:56:47,253
Do you have fresh towels
in your room?

529
00:56:48,168 --> 00:56:50,837
Let's go and check it out.

530
00:56:58,136 --> 00:57:00,011
Oh yes!

531
00:57:00,180 --> 00:57:02,754
<i>Hakala': downfall was the fact -</i>

532
00:57:02,932 --> 00:57:08,449
<i>that this world is full of
jealous and vengeful men.</i>

533
00:57:09,648 --> 00:57:12,934
Your friend is quite the ladies' man.

534
00:57:13,860 --> 00:57:16,577
Well, I don't know about that.

535
00:57:17,197 --> 00:57:21,907
We're organ repairmen.
We're just doing our job.

536
00:57:22,035 --> 00:57:27,552
<i>Yrjö' was a novice drinker,
so I started buying him drinks -</i>

537
00:57:27,666 --> 00:57:33,503
<i>and pumping him for information
on Hakala's female encounters.</i>

538
00:57:34,005 --> 00:57:39,712
<i>1 realised that this is the story
I'd been looking for.</i>

539
00:57:40,095 --> 00:57:44,603
"Superstud took the waitress'
hand and guided her to the stairs -

540
00:57:44,683 --> 00:57:47,471
leading to a sinful motel room."

541
00:57:47,686 --> 00:57:52,823
"The waitress felt hot and cold
waves going through her..."

542
00:57:56,403 --> 00:57:58,728
"ﬂ-body-n

543
00:58:07,539 --> 00:58:11,869
I have a sensational story for you.
I'm sending it right away.

544
00:58:18,550 --> 00:58:22,465
Don't puke on the ﬂoor!
- I didn't do it on purpose.

545
00:58:23,763 --> 00:58:28,687
I'm sorry.
- I'm sending you a bill.

546
00:58:28,810 --> 00:58:32,357
How can I contact you?
- Call me on the porcelain phone.

547
00:58:32,439 --> 00:58:35,986
Where's Raili?
- She's taking a shower.

548
00:58:36,109 --> 00:58:38,862
Shit!
- What's wrong, Yrjö?

549
00:58:40,155 --> 00:58:42,943
Should I drive today?
- Gentlemen...

550
00:58:43,158 --> 00:58:47,298
where are you headed?
- To Köyrä', I think.

551
00:58:48,121 --> 00:58:52,131
To Köyrä? I'm going there, too.

552
00:58:54,711 --> 00:58:57,594
Can I tag along?

553
00:58:57,839 --> 00:59:01,980
Life on the road
must be quite wild.

554
00:59:02,719 --> 00:59:06,136
Well, all kinds of things happen
along the way.

555
00:59:07,182 --> 00:59:11,642
My life's not always this wild.
- I can believe that.

556
00:59:13,146 --> 00:59:21,273
<i>I was so smitten
but you gave me the mitten</i>

557
00:59:21,613 --> 00:59:29,277
<i>La la la la la la,
why did you make a fool out of me?</i>

558
00:59:30,121 --> 00:59:33,752
The organ repairmen, I presume.
Welcome to Köyrä.

559
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:38,924
Our organ is in need of service.
I'm cantor Sakari Res.

560
00:59:45,220 --> 00:59:49,680
Well, well, well.
We have never serviced this organ.

561
00:59:49,849 --> 00:59:52,519
The vicar has been stingy-

562
00:59:52,769 --> 00:59:57,194
but soon our organ will be clean as
a whistle. It's a lead-pipe cinch!

563
00:59:59,067 --> 01:00:03,278
How come every other
pedalboard key is broken?

564
01:00:03,446 --> 01:00:09,129
There's a big wedding coming up.
I'll be going up the aisle -

565
01:00:09,202 --> 01:00:11,670
with a beautiful woman.

566
01:00:14,958 --> 01:00:17,912
You're getting married?
Congratulations.

567
01:00:18,044 --> 01:00:20,014
I do!

568
01:00:24,426 --> 01:00:27,095
I'm playing my trouser trumpet.

569
01:00:45,196 --> 01:00:48,957
I'm the vicar of this parish.
Rauno Ylämäki.

570
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:52,214
Hello.
- Nice to meet you.

571
01:00:52,662 --> 01:00:57,206
Are the organ repairmen
busy at work?

572
01:00:57,500 --> 01:00:59,885
Yes, they're tuning the organ.

573
01:01:00,003 --> 01:01:05,211
Go tell them that there's a lunch
waiting at the vicarage.

574
01:01:05,383 --> 01:01:09,559
Elk soup.
- Thanks for the invite.

575
01:01:09,721 --> 01:01:16,531
What the hell? Your Camionnette's
radiator is leaking.

576
01:01:17,979 --> 01:01:23,152
I'm not a big fan of organ music.

577
01:01:23,860 --> 01:01:28,499
Our Sakari is such a bad
organ player-

578
01:01:28,615 --> 01:01:32,495
that he can barely play any hymns -

579
01:01:33,203 --> 01:01:36,050
let alone Christmas songs.

580
01:01:42,462 --> 01:01:49,343
Okay, that's enough. But now our
organ will be ready for the wedding.

581
01:01:49,511 --> 01:01:53,556
An esteemed cantor
is coming from Nurmo.

582
01:01:53,723 --> 01:01:57,306
He knows all the wedding marches
by heart.

583
01:01:58,979 --> 01:02:01,612
Sakari told us about the wedding.

584
01:02:01,731 --> 01:02:05,563
That's right.
And it's going to be a big wedding.

585
01:02:06,152 --> 01:02:11,361
My daughter Susanna and Sakari
are getting married.

586
01:02:11,574 --> 01:02:16,119
They're going to love each other
till death does them part.

587
01:02:20,709 --> 01:02:22,619
That was a good one!

588
01:02:24,129 --> 01:02:28,589
Whoever is holding a fart,
is keeping a secret.

589
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:32,976
And if shit doesn't stink,
it's gone bad!

590
01:02:36,641 --> 01:02:42,229
<i>Ben appétit!
-The vicarage was a madhouse.</i>

591
01:02:42,522 --> 01:02:45,239
We spent weeks in Köyrä.

592
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:50,074
The cantor had completely crushed
the organ.

593
01:02:56,536 --> 01:02:59,419
That'll do!

594
01:03:05,879 --> 01:03:08,204
<i>Yrjö and Arvo beavered away.</i>

595
01:03:08,381 --> 01:03:11,798
<i>I must say,
they were true professionals.</i>

596
01:03:13,928 --> 01:03:15,649
A little too high.

597
01:03:15,805 --> 01:03:18,688
<i>They were staying
in the vicarage granary.</i>

598
01:03:18,808 --> 01:03:24,930
<i>They slept all night
and worked all day.</i>

599
01:03:26,358 --> 01:03:27,639
Oh yeah.

600
01:03:27,776 --> 01:03:31,228
<i>I decided to observe
how the situation would unfold.</i>

601
01:03:31,321 --> 01:03:33,480
<i>I lied to the vicar-</i>

602
01:03:33,615 --> 01:03:36,747
<i>that I was a poet
who needed a workroom.</i>

603
01:03:36,993 --> 01:03:40,031
I'm a poet who needs a workroom.

604
01:03:40,163 --> 01:03:44,672
There's always room for a poet
in our granary.

605
01:03:44,876 --> 01:03:47,012
I know a poem.

606
01:03:47,837 --> 01:03:52,298
<i>I was just fifteen
when I took my grandfather's life</i>

607
01:03:52,509 --> 01:03:56,899
<i>I taught him a lesson
by tickling his ribs with my knife</i>

608
01:03:59,557 --> 01:04:03,437
<i>I wrote my best work
in that granary.</i>

609
01:04:03,770 --> 01:04:06,867
<i>"Finland's sinful summer",
"Superstud" -</i>

610
01:04:06,940 --> 01:04:11,080
<i>"Superstud and the three tarts '1
"Superstud sows his seeds</i> ” -

611
01:04:11,194 --> 01:04:15,026
<i>"The return of Superstud",
"Superstud rides again" -</i>

612
01:04:15,115 --> 01:04:19,125
<i>"who is Superstud?'
and 'This is Superstud".</i>

613
01:04:21,037 --> 01:04:27,717
Those magazines sold like hot cakes,
and I got my nickname, "Slop Bucket".

614
01:04:28,003 --> 01:04:31,704
But then the story
took an unexpected turn.

615
01:04:31,965 --> 01:04:38,087
<i>Arvo was a restless man.
He couldn't sleep.</i>

616
01:05:35,820 --> 01:05:39,902
Good evening.
- Good evening to you, too.

617
01:05:41,284 --> 01:05:45,745
You play the saw beautifully.
Fancy a walk this night?

618
01:05:49,334 --> 01:05:52,620
I don't want to marry
that farting ogre.

619
01:05:54,089 --> 01:05:58,549
He behaves like a pig.
And my father just laughs.

620
01:05:59,427 --> 01:06:02,524
He thinks that Sakari is a funny guy.

621
01:06:02,597 --> 01:06:05,266
You cannot force love to happen.

622
01:06:12,273 --> 01:06:13,614
I want to run away.

623
01:06:13,733 --> 01:06:17,649
Arvo, it is a new work day.

624
01:06:19,072 --> 01:06:21,990
Today, we're going to polish
organ pipes.

625
01:06:27,247 --> 01:06:29,086
Arvo?

626
01:06:32,210 --> 01:06:34,500
Is Arvo here?

627
01:06:41,428 --> 01:06:43,563
Goddamn...

628
01:06:46,808 --> 01:06:48,813
THIS IS SUPERSTUD

629
01:06:49,019 --> 01:06:51,558
Fucking hell!

630
01:06:55,317 --> 01:06:56,563
YOU rat!

631
01:06:56,943 --> 01:07:02,187
Hello? This is headmaster Isotalo.

632
01:07:02,657 --> 01:07:08,115
I have a question.
- Ask away.

633
01:07:08,246 --> 01:07:15,875
Is an organ repairman named
Arvo Hakala repairing your organ?

634
01:07:17,088 --> 01:07:18,714
Well... yes.

635
01:07:20,300 --> 01:07:24,132
Do you read magazines?

636
01:07:24,471 --> 01:07:28,766
Let's cut his balls off-

637
01:07:28,892 --> 01:07:34,824
with a rusty fighting knife.

638
01:07:38,360 --> 01:07:40,436
Susanna?

639
01:07:40,737 --> 01:07:43,620
Susanna!

640
01:07:44,616 --> 01:07:46,751
Where is Susanna?
- Susanna!

641
01:07:46,868 --> 01:07:50,214
Who is Susanna?
- Susanna is Susanna!

642
01:07:50,288 --> 01:07:54,713
Susanna!
- I'm going to kill him!

643
01:07:54,918 --> 01:07:58,335
I'm going to kill him!
- Kill! Kill!

644
01:08:01,841 --> 01:08:06,646
Arvo, wake up.
You have to go now.

645
01:08:09,891 --> 01:08:13,237
Susanna, I think I love you.

646
01:08:13,937 --> 01:08:16,606
I love you too, Arvo.

647
01:08:22,237 --> 01:08:25,583
Where is he?
-where is that lothario?

648
01:08:26,157 --> 01:08:28,412
Is he in the cupboard?

649
01:08:29,536 --> 01:08:31,920
I'm going to kill him!

650
01:08:32,205 --> 01:08:39,335
Rauno, do you have heavier weapons
in the attic or under the floor?

651
01:08:43,883 --> 01:08:46,019
I sure do.

652
01:08:56,271 --> 01:08:58,311
Arvo!

653
01:09:02,819 --> 01:09:05,607
What is this commotion?

654
01:09:11,119 --> 01:09:13,587
Arvo, you're in trouble.

655
01:09:15,457 --> 01:09:17,533
They're pissed off.

656
01:09:28,428 --> 01:09:31,382
They hit the engine.

657
01:09:36,853 --> 01:09:40,116
Yrjö, thanks for everything.
I'm sorry.

658
01:09:57,082 --> 01:10:02,005
It's time to break out
the heavy artillery.

659
01:10:22,816 --> 01:10:25,604
Sakari, a little to the left.
- What?

660
01:10:25,777 --> 01:10:30,701
Everyone, squeeze up a bit.
Taneli, chin up.

661
01:10:31,324 --> 01:10:34,492
Don't look into the camera.
Say cheese.

662
01:10:35,537 --> 01:10:37,827
Great.

663
01:10:38,373 --> 01:10:40,592
Get the hell out of our way.

664
01:10:40,792 --> 01:10:44,838
Superstud, your game's up.
It's payback time!

665
01:10:45,005 --> 01:10:48,457
Time to meet your maker, lothario!

666
01:10:55,890 --> 01:11:03,946
<i>I was so smitten
but you gave me the mitten</i>

667
01:11:04,441 --> 01:11:12,034
<i>La la la la la la,
why did you make a fool out of me?</i>

668
01:11:49,444 --> 01:11:51,948
Are you happy now?

669
01:12:11,633 --> 01:12:17,434
<i>Arvo Hakala was remembered by
Susanna, Yrjö and Rekku the dog.</i>

670
01:12:18,515 --> 01:12:24,138
<i>Also a multitude of women
paid their respects to a man -</i>

671
01:12:24,312 --> 01:12:27,824
<i>who had brought joy
to their everyday lives.</i>

672
01:12:28,358 --> 01:12:34,195
<i>Ever since the funeral, there have
been fresh ﬂowers on his grave -</i>

673
01:12:34,447 --> 01:12:37,401
<i>and an eternal flame.</i>

674
01:12:38,702 --> 01:12:42,712
That was the beginning of my career,
but it's all over now.

675
01:12:42,956 --> 01:12:47,215
Don't you want to order anything?
- No. I've had enough.

676
01:12:52,549 --> 01:12:55,337
Hey, you forgot your magazines.

677
01:13:05,395 --> 01:13:08,029
INTERNATIONAL FUNDING
FOR EXCALIBUR?

678
01:13:08,481 --> 01:13:12,029
This is sub-par work.
who did the poster?

679
01:13:12,110 --> 01:13:15,562
Me. It's not that bad.

680
01:13:16,531 --> 01:13:20,921
I have to get a couple million.
Otherwise, it's bye-bye life.

681
01:13:21,036 --> 01:13:23,753
Has Make the Millionaire arrived?
- No.

682
01:13:23,872 --> 01:13:27,454
But the room is full of
international sponsors.

683
01:14:32,315 --> 01:14:36,610
Sometimes Igor has a little taster.
How do you say it in English?

684
01:15:35,587 --> 01:15:37,746
Well?

685
01:15:37,964 --> 01:15:42,176
The Americans have left.
They're so rude.

686
01:18:03,526 --> 01:18:07,821
Do you have to talk over it?
Now the Germans have left.

687
01:18:07,989 --> 01:18:11,905
Achtung! Ze programm kontinues.

688
01:18:12,243 --> 01:18:16,254
Lapland! You burned Rovaniemi.

689
01:18:16,748 --> 01:18:21,007
Just to let you know,
Make the Millionaire is now here.

690
01:18:21,169 --> 01:18:24,123
Make is here. Great.
- No, it's not.

691
01:18:37,477 --> 01:18:41,618
What were you saying?
- Make drank three bottles of booze.

692
01:18:41,773 --> 01:18:43,849
He is shitfaced.

693
01:18:48,113 --> 01:18:50,497
Fucking hell.

694
01:18:55,912 --> 01:18:58,166
I have money!

695
01:19:03,086 --> 01:19:05,803
Let's go.
- I'm on the ceiling.

696
01:19:14,723 --> 01:19:17,736
The cannibals
get the shit kicked out of them.

697
01:20:15,241 --> 01:20:19,786
I have a train to catch.

698
01:20:21,665 --> 01:20:25,841
"1 have a train to catch."
Catch that train then!

699
01:20:26,002 --> 01:20:31,246
What about your train? And your bus?
- I have a dentist appointment.

700
01:20:31,424 --> 01:20:35,850
Go catch your trains and buses! Go!
The train is leaving!

701
01:20:36,012 --> 01:20:39,892
Go! All aboard!

702
01:20:44,688 --> 01:20:46,408
What kind of mistake?

703
01:21:09,671 --> 01:21:12,245
<i>Make!
-Yeah?</i>

704
01:21:12,924 --> 01:21:17,219
The Japs say that (Ögil killed
John's father Bill in part II.

705
01:21:17,304 --> 01:21:20,187
<i>(Ögil poisoned him.</i>

706
01:21:20,974 --> 01:21:25,435
why didn't anyone tell me?
- You never ask <i>anything.</i>

707
01:21:27,439 --> 01:21:29,230
<i>Dear 3695-"...</i>

708
01:21:49,461 --> 01:21:52,000
It was a great success.

709
01:21:53,548 --> 01:21:56,930
Don't you fucking write about this.
- Of course not.

710
01:21:58,428 --> 01:22:02,438
Kurre. These Japanese gentlemen
have something to say.

711
01:22:08,229 --> 01:22:11,812
Screw <i>Zero, Nagamoto,
hara/rirl} kamikaze</i> and <i>banzai.</i>

712
01:22:38,385 --> 01:22:42,466
Soon we'll be hunting bears!
We're tough as nails!

713
01:22:43,723 --> 01:22:46,820
Hey, try to behave back there.

714
01:22:47,602 --> 01:22:50,106
What the fuck?

715
01:22:50,230 --> 01:22:54,311
We just got 18 million!
Shut the fuck up, you flying monkey!

716
01:22:54,442 --> 01:22:57,788
Don't you know who I am?
john Excalibur!

717
01:22:58,571 --> 01:23:01,953
I don't care! I have money.

718
01:23:02,200 --> 01:23:06,341
<i>I have so much money
that even death is funny</i>

719
01:23:06,496 --> 01:23:10,886
<i>I have such an expensive toy
that even death brings me joy</i>

720
01:23:11,084 --> 01:23:13,338
Look at those country bumpkins.

721
01:23:18,049 --> 01:23:20,897
Try to hit them.

722
01:23:26,558 --> 01:23:29,820
Hey, flying monkey, land there.

723
01:23:29,978 --> 01:23:32,113
We're getting out.

724
01:23:32,355 --> 01:23:37,279
This is not your destination.
- Do as Kurre tells you.

725
01:23:37,360 --> 01:23:40,279
Land the whirlybird.
- Land the whirlybird.

726
01:23:40,405 --> 01:23:43,158
Land the whirlybird!

727
01:23:44,200 --> 01:23:49,005
Daddy! A helo!
The Vietnam War is starting!

728
01:23:49,122 --> 01:23:52,254
Are you okay, boys?
-Jeremias is fine.

729
01:23:52,375 --> 01:23:56,041
Hesekiel is okay. They dropped
a hundred kilos of napalm.

730
01:23:56,129 --> 01:23:58,134
Don't exaggerate.

731
01:23:58,298 --> 01:24:01,644
They're just arrogant arseholes
from Helsinki.

732
01:24:01,926 --> 01:24:04,596
Calm down.

733
01:24:06,222 --> 01:24:09,983
More. A little bit more.
That's good.

734
01:24:14,356 --> 01:24:18,496
Guys, guess what this lake is called?

735
01:24:19,486 --> 01:24:21,894
This is Jordan.

736
01:24:23,531 --> 01:24:27,198
Make, let's booze.

737
01:24:32,832 --> 01:24:35,870
A killer. Don't point it at me.

738
01:24:36,336 --> 01:24:38,412
Good.

739
01:24:40,256 --> 01:24:44,397
This is chamois from
Mount Kilimanjaro. 400 euros a kilo.

740
01:24:44,594 --> 01:24:47,311
I have a hundred kilos
in the freezer.

741
01:24:47,722 --> 01:24:51,673
Tender as fuck.
Marbled chamois.

742
01:24:52,185 --> 01:24:55,768
Let's leave the meat to cook
and shoot some bears.

743
01:24:56,356 --> 01:25:01,030
Take your CB radios.
- Be quiet for a moment.

744
01:25:01,194 --> 01:25:04,646
Shush! Listen.

745
01:25:08,410 --> 01:25:11,921
The wilderness... It's so relaxing!

746
01:25:23,299 --> 01:25:25,340
Where are the bears?

747
01:25:28,805 --> 01:25:31,973
Put the safety on!
- Where is it?

748
01:25:34,185 --> 01:25:37,139
There's something wrong
with my rifle.

749
01:25:39,316 --> 01:25:45,082
A bullet hit momma's jar.
- Esteri, my wife!

750
01:25:46,031 --> 01:25:50,705
Father Isaskar, those townies have
set up camp without permission.

751
01:25:50,910 --> 01:25:55,122
Nobody camps here,
with or without permission.

752
01:25:55,623 --> 01:25:58,720
Calm down, boys.
- But we're already calm.

753
01:25:58,793 --> 01:26:04,097
Yeah, but more.
I'm declaring a holy war.

754
01:26:32,661 --> 01:26:36,077
Metusalem, bury these.

755
01:26:36,456 --> 01:26:41,700
If you live by the elk rifle,
you die by the elk rifle.

756
01:26:41,836 --> 01:26:46,546
It's time to teach these fucktards
a valuable lesson.

757
01:26:47,968 --> 01:26:52,512
Throw them in there.
- Thomas! Korhonen!

758
01:26:52,931 --> 01:26:55,648
Don't move. They'll see you.

759
01:26:56,601 --> 01:26:59,235
There's one of those vermin.

760
01:26:59,396 --> 01:27:04,106
Look.
The townies are surprisingly fast.

761
01:27:04,859 --> 01:27:07,363
Lead it a little.

762
01:27:09,614 --> 01:27:11,868
That's my boy!

763
01:27:12,659 --> 01:27:15,068
Go get the body.

764
01:27:19,499 --> 01:27:22,453
What is this thingy?

765
01:27:26,297 --> 01:27:28,801
Shut

766
01:27:33,054 --> 01:27:35,273
You townie monkey.

767
01:27:51,656 --> 01:27:53,981
Wake up, Make!

768
01:28:00,832 --> 01:28:04,095
Hello? Does anyone hear me? Over.

769
01:28:37,369 --> 01:28:40,465
Hello? Does anyone hear me? Over.

770
01:28:42,123 --> 01:28:44,971
Hello? Does anyone hear me? Over.

771
01:28:46,169 --> 01:28:49,301
<i>Hello. Over.</i>

772
01:28:52,342 --> 01:28:56,008
Hello. Our camp has been destroyed.

773
01:28:56,513 --> 01:29:00,724
Crazy hillbillies are hunting us,
just like in Deliverance.

774
01:29:00,976 --> 01:29:03,301
I want to get the fuck out of here.

775
01:29:09,109 --> 01:29:13,119
<i>Come to the forest road,
and we'll pick you up.</i>

776
01:29:13,279 --> 01:29:16,910
<i>There's no need to use swear words.
Help is on its way.</i>

777
01:29:17,117 --> 01:29:20,913
<i>Thank you and goodbye.</i>
- Bye.

778
01:29:27,335 --> 01:29:30,218
Did someone call for a rescue party?

779
01:29:33,883 --> 01:29:36,458
He's zigzagging.

780
01:29:57,490 --> 01:29:59,650
It's no use.

781
01:30:04,414 --> 01:30:08,329
Kurre?
- Kurre! Over here!

782
01:30:08,626 --> 01:30:11,794
Kom here!
- Great, Kurre!

783
01:30:11,963 --> 01:30:14,123
Open this door.
- Get pliers.

784
01:30:14,299 --> 01:30:17,431
Shut up! You're going to wake them.
- Kurre!

785
01:30:17,552 --> 01:30:19,522
Kurre?
- Are you leaving?

786
01:30:19,596 --> 01:30:22,942
Shut up! You're going to wake
the catapult guy up.

787
01:30:23,308 --> 01:30:26,440
This bike has no chain.

788
01:30:29,439 --> 01:30:31,598
<i>Donkey KN“?-!</i>

789
01:30:38,448 --> 01:30:40,287
Kurre!
- Help us!

790
01:30:40,367 --> 01:30:42,526
Kurre!
- Fuck of-f!

791
01:30:51,753 --> 01:30:54,387
Hey, he's Excalibur.

792
01:30:56,633 --> 01:31:00,714
The action man. Come.

793
01:31:01,012 --> 01:31:03,148
Get away! Not you!

794
01:31:06,893 --> 01:31:09,029
I'm going to make it. I'm a star.

795
01:31:17,904 --> 01:31:24,405
Let's watch all the Exralibur films.
Metusalem, bring us some mead.

796
01:31:24,494 --> 01:31:27,033
Mead!
- Mead!

797
01:31:27,205 --> 01:31:30,088
Mead!
- Mead.

798
01:31:31,751 --> 01:31:35,334
What kind of mead?
- Strong mead.

799
01:32:00,488 --> 01:32:04,071
What are we going to watch next?
- Part II.

800
01:32:04,200 --> 01:32:08,032
But we just watched it.
- We're watching it again.

801
01:32:11,499 --> 01:32:16,494
You can fly.
- No, not really.

802
01:32:16,629 --> 01:32:19,762
Have a fish.
- It's a stuntman.

803
01:32:21,676 --> 01:32:26,754
<i>You have ﬂown a spaceship.
-Have you seen trolls or orcs?</i>

804
01:32:27,390 --> 01:32:29,775
What?
- Trolls and orcs.

805
01:32:29,893 --> 01:32:33,654
Can you do anything?
Do you know how to fence?

806
01:32:34,189 --> 01:32:37,107
As a matter of fact,
I know how to fence.

807
01:32:37,525 --> 01:32:41,322
You need to know
how to hold a sword.

808
01:32:42,447 --> 01:32:44,357
I see.

809
01:32:47,744 --> 01:32:51,955
Metusalem goes mental
when he grabs a sword.

810
01:32:52,123 --> 01:32:56,798
He's unbeatable.
- He punctured Jeremias' eye.

811
01:32:57,212 --> 01:33:01,791
I recommend a turtle defence,
but I'm afraid it won't save you.

812
01:33:01,883 --> 01:33:04,837
Nothing will save you.
-Break a leg!

813
01:33:05,053 --> 01:33:07,592
Let the tournament begin.

814
01:33:09,975 --> 01:33:14,969
He'd probably need a stuntman.
That's good!

815
01:33:15,730 --> 01:33:20,476
That hit left his head spinning
and ears ringing.

816
01:33:22,028 --> 01:33:24,283
Great!

817
01:33:27,200 --> 01:33:31,875
That was a cowardly move.
A kick in the nuts from behind.

818
01:33:31,955 --> 01:33:34,363
His nuts can't take such punishment.

819
01:33:40,588 --> 01:33:43,436
Watch out!
- He's behind you!

820
01:33:45,927 --> 01:33:47,932
Hit him!

821
01:33:48,596 --> 01:33:51,550
Done.
- He's dead.

822
01:33:59,983 --> 01:34:05,440
Thomas is dead.
They killed Thomas!

823
01:34:05,864 --> 01:34:10,324
They'll kill us all.
They're going to lynkka us.

824
01:34:10,577 --> 01:34:12,796
Shit! We're all going to db'.

825
01:34:13,038 --> 01:34:16,953
I didn't want to go
on a hunting trip!

826
01:34:17,083 --> 01:34:21,224
Quit your whining!
-Shut up!

827
01:34:22,088 --> 01:34:28,898
<i>Listen to them.
- Let's rut this off first.</i>

828
01:34:30,180 --> 01:34:33,881
Then we'll stick the knife
into the rectum.

829
01:34:34,100 --> 01:34:40,281
We'll stick the knife deep inside
and slice open the belly.

830
01:34:41,858 --> 01:34:46,438
Like this. And have to be careful
not to burst the gall bladder.

831
01:34:46,988 --> 01:34:52,126
What is that white slime?
- This is a male.

832
01:34:53,036 --> 01:34:54,946
A man.
- It's spunk.

833
01:34:55,080 --> 01:34:57,334
Yes, it's semen.

834
01:34:58,083 --> 01:35:01,345
Give these to the cat.

835
01:35:03,129 --> 01:35:08,053
<i>Vim“.
-Then cut off the head.</i>

836
01:35:08,134 --> 01:35:13,687
They're going to eat us.
They're cannibals.

837
01:35:14,140 --> 01:35:18,945
What about the eyes and the brain?
- This has no brains.

838
01:35:20,230 --> 01:35:26,601
It's time to take you inside.
- Everything's ready.

839
01:35:27,821 --> 01:35:32,400
Everything.
- Forgive me.

840
01:35:34,327 --> 01:35:38,337
You have nothing to fear.
- I love you guys.

841
01:35:45,255 --> 01:35:48,173
Excalibur woke up.

842
01:35:48,466 --> 01:35:50,875
He's a nice guy.

843
01:35:51,052 --> 01:35:55,596
Give me some fish.
Take off your hat.

844
01:35:56,641 --> 01:35:58,801
Korhonen... he's alive.

845
01:35:58,893 --> 01:36:03,105
I have to say
that violence is golden.

846
01:36:20,957 --> 01:36:25,786
Daddy! There are japaneses
in our garden.

847
01:36:35,555 --> 01:36:37,774
It's a Lexus.

848
01:37:35,281 --> 01:37:37,785
What the hell? Where am I?

849
01:37:43,748 --> 01:37:45,908
More violence.

850
01:37:49,462 --> 01:37:54,351
Kurre, I have a horrible hangover.
I need something to drink.

851
01:37:54,634 --> 01:37:58,431
There's some mead.
- Guess how much money I have?

852
01:37:58,722 --> 01:38:01,296
How much?
- I don't know.

853
01:38:02,642 --> 01:38:06,059
<i>We spent another night
at the Toukkas' -</i>

854
01:38:06,271 --> 01:38:09,652
<i>drinking strong mead.</i>

855
01:38:09,941 --> 01:38:13,204
<i>We became best of friends.</i>

856
01:38:13,737 --> 01:38:18,376
<i>we're going to remember this lesson
for the rest of our lives.</i>

857
01:38:19,284 --> 01:38:24,278
<i>Respect your neighbour.
All men are equally worthy.</i>

858
01:38:24,748 --> 01:38:29,007
<i>Wash your hands before meals
and finish your plate.</i>

859
01:38:29,461 --> 01:38:32,178
<i>No singing at the dinner table.</i>

860
01:38:53,735 --> 01:38:59,572
Yes, but I've told you that there
won't be more Excalibur films.

861
01:38:59,908 --> 01:39:03,325
Silence. Rolling.

862
01:39:07,248 --> 01:39:10,831
And action.
- Raspberry fool is a tricky dish.

863
01:39:10,960 --> 01:39:14,971
But you can also use other berries.

864
01:39:15,173 --> 01:39:17,747
Add some sugar.

865
01:39:18,134 --> 01:39:20,602
I'm using potato ﬂour -

866
01:39:20,804 --> 01:39:26,321
but if you can't eat it,
you can use just about anything.

867
01:39:35,110 --> 01:39:39,914
Arvo? Is that you, Arvo Hakala?

868
01:39:41,574 --> 01:39:43,793
Slop Bucket.

869
01:39:50,542 --> 01:39:53,804
How did you get out alive?

870
01:39:57,257 --> 01:40:00,603
There was a cellar
under the floorboards.

871
01:40:01,636 --> 01:40:03,712
Good to hear.

872
01:40:04,222 --> 01:40:08,932
It all worked out in the end.

873
01:40:34,127 --> 01:40:36,701
Last one in the lake is a rotten egg!

874
01:40:42,969 --> 01:40:45,473
Damn, I forgot to take off my watch.

875
01:41:06,660 --> 01:41:10,836
