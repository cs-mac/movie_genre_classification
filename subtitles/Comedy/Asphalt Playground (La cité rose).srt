and waiting; I know that room. "</i>

9
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:18,498
I can't wait to see you in this
piece. Look out, here comes Canetti.

10
00:01:18,706 --> 00:01:22,919
- The conductor's been waiting three hours.
- So?

11
00:01:23,127 --> 00:01:25,588
The premiere is less than 48 hours away.

12
00:01:25,796 --> 00:01:29,300
Do you know many people whom
Cocteau's written a piece for?

13
00:01:30,176 --> 00:01:31,969
- Miss?
- Yes, Suzanne?

14
00:01:32,178 --> 00:01:36,140
Meurisse called. Dinner
with Mr. Cocteau at eight.

15
00:01:36,349 --> 00:01:37,808
You see?

16
00:01:38,017 --> 00:01:41,562
- Ask him to come back at midnight.
- Are you sure?

17
00:01:41,771 --> 00:01:45,483
You're worse than Raymond. Do this, do that.

18
00:01:45,816 --> 00:01:48,903
- That's why you fired him.
- Stop it.

19
00:01:49,111 --> 00:01:52,490
- Do you wish to see the gowns?
- Yes, the gowns.

20
00:02:00,414 --> 00:02:04,919
That's all of them. Careful with those pins.

21
00:02:05,336 --> 00:02:07,755
The simplest one, without the collar.

22
00:02:11,342 --> 00:02:14,386
There's a man at the door...
He has something for you.

23
00:02:14,595 --> 00:02:16,430
- Who is it?
- A soldier.

24
00:02:16,638 --> 00:02:21,226
I told him you were busy. He's outside
in the corridor. A bit embarrassed.

25
00:02:21,435 --> 00:02:23,645
Have him come in.

26
00:02:31,987 --> 00:02:33,322
Will you come this way?

27
00:02:40,829 --> 00:02:44,458
- Here she is.
- Much better without the collar.

28
00:02:45,417 --> 00:02:46,835
Yes?

29
00:02:47,294 --> 00:02:50,213
My name is Michel Emer. I'm a corporal.

30
00:02:50,422 --> 00:02:53,300
This isn't the army. What do you want?

31
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:58,430
I have a song for you.

32
00:02:58,638 --> 00:03:03,477
Not another... I've enough already.
I have a premiere in two days' time.

33
00:03:03,685 --> 00:03:05,103
I wish this one.

34
00:03:05,312 --> 00:03:07,606
Tomorrow I leave for the front.

35
00:03:11,485 --> 00:03:14,154
There's the piano. You have five minutes.

36
00:03:18,825 --> 00:03:20,285
Edith...

37
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:25,081
We shall have to wait.

38
00:04:02,785 --> 00:04:04,287
Stop.

39
00:04:06,247 --> 00:04:07,874
I want it.

40
00:04:08,249 --> 00:04:09,792
Everybody out.

41
00:04:11,586 --> 00:04:14,464
You can't mean that. We're already late.

42
00:04:14,672 --> 00:04:16,340
What can't she mean?

43
00:04:16,549 --> 00:04:19,177
Play it. I want it for Bobino.

44
00:04:22,972 --> 00:04:24,557
You can't do that.

45
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:28,769
Edith Piaf can do whatever she pleases!

46
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:39,030
French, please.

47
00:04:39,238 --> 00:04:43,117
- She's too hopeless, too poor...
- Help us out here, Charles.

48
00:04:43,367 --> 00:04:45,286
I'm no translator.

49
00:04:45,703 --> 00:04:51,500
<i>'Miserable. And not in the French tradition
of the Can-Can and Gay Paris. '</i>

50
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:53,127
A complete flop.

51
00:04:53,335 --> 00:04:56,881
This isn't the first time I've had to fight.

52
00:04:57,214 --> 00:04:59,925
The Americans want pretty girls, not me.

53
00:05:00,134 --> 00:05:03,762
I'm not the Parisian sex
bomb you were hoping for.

54
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:08,851
Can you picture me in a ballet?
With a feather in my arse?

55
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:18,902
Go ahead and laugh. I'm not what they want.

56
00:05:19,153 --> 00:05:22,531
- They think I'm too doleful, THEY are stupid.
- Yes, too stupid.

57
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:34,418
- You made the front page.
- Two columns.

58
00:05:50,601 --> 00:05:53,186
I can't read it. Translate it.

59
00:05:53,395 --> 00:05:58,817
He says that she shouldn't let
you go. That it would be a mistake.

60
00:05:59,026 --> 00:06:01,653
The Americans don't deserve you.

61
00:06:02,821 --> 00:06:05,907
I knew something would
happen! I have to change...

62
00:06:06,241 --> 00:06:08,618
...Ginou, help me help me choose a dress.

63
00:06:10,412 --> 00:06:13,457
I'm going out tonight. I have a date.

64
00:06:28,013 --> 00:06:31,016
- What's this, Marcel?
- Beef... try it.

65
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:36,021
It smells like damp dog.

66
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:40,817
What?

67
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:50,243
Your English is as good as the meat.

68
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:59,127
Don't you like it here?

69
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:02,672
I was taken a bit by
surprise. I didn't expect it...

70
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:11,180
...when you phoned to say that as two French
people in New York we should have a meal...

71
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:15,852
- ...I didn't expect this.
- I come here all the time.

72
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:23,192
You sure know how to spoil a girl.

73
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:40,001
- Have you decided?
- Twee broodjes pastrami.

74
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:48,426
two Tournedos Rossini, and a
bottle of Chateau Langelus 1938.

75
00:07:53,097 --> 00:07:57,393
- Are you hungry?
- It's better than cooked dog.

76
00:07:58,477 --> 00:07:59,937
I'm sorry.

77
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:03,399
Let's start over. Okay?

78
00:08:05,025 --> 00:08:09,488
- How long have you been in New York?
- Eight weeks.

79
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:14,451
- And do you like America?
- It doesn't interest me at all.

80
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,912
I don't understand them,
and they don't understand me.

81
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:19,665
- You must miss Paris.
- Terribly.

82
00:08:19,873 --> 00:08:22,459
What do you do when you're not singing?

83
00:08:24,628 --> 00:08:28,632
Your like the police with
your questions. I knit.

84
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:33,053
Give me your size and I'll knit you a sweater.

85
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:34,763
No, but thanks all the same...

86
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:40,102
- Those people recognized you.
- Really?

87
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:47,860
<i>'That schmuck lost his recent
fights. He's washed up. '</i>

88
00:08:48,068 --> 00:08:50,737
- I'll show them who's washed up.
- No!

89
00:08:51,613 --> 00:08:54,491
Relax. I was joking.

90
00:09:06,837 --> 00:09:08,296
It's fine.

91
00:09:19,015 --> 00:09:22,060
- Can we be less formal to each other?
- Of course.

92
00:09:22,769 --> 00:09:26,940
- What do you do when you aren't boxing?
- I train and I run...

93
00:09:27,148 --> 00:09:31,820
- And after the training?
- In Morocco I work on my farm.

94
00:09:32,529 --> 00:09:34,364
You have a farm?

95
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:36,825
I breed pigs.

96
00:09:41,579 --> 00:09:43,456
Well, why not?

97
00:09:46,835 --> 00:09:48,753
Absolutely. Why not?

98
00:09:48,962 --> 00:09:52,173
modern, with superb, fat pigs.

99
00:09:52,465 --> 00:09:55,510
- Who takes care of them when you're boxing?
- My wife.

100
00:10:04,018 --> 00:10:05,478
You have...

101
00:10:06,771 --> 00:10:08,147
...wonderful hands.

102
00:10:10,733 --> 00:10:14,654
- Did you hear what I said, Momone?
- You have really beautiful fingers.

103
00:10:16,656 --> 00:10:18,032
Listen.

104
00:10:18,241 --> 00:10:20,284
What colour are your eyes?

105
00:10:20,868 --> 00:10:25,039
- He leaned over...
- And his breath smelled.

106
00:10:25,248 --> 00:10:28,543
- You can be such a bitch!
- He is of course a pig breeder.

107
00:10:28,751 --> 00:10:31,546
- He said...
- Violet blue.

108
00:10:31,838 --> 00:10:33,631
Of course, violet blue.

109
00:10:34,132 --> 00:10:38,177
It was the way he said it.
As though he was a child.

110
00:10:39,804 --> 00:10:43,558
You're just like a fairy.

111
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,019
A bit of an exaggeration.

112
00:11:16,298 --> 00:11:19,760
- Did you kiss him?
- I didn't dare.

113
00:11:21,178 --> 00:11:24,223
- It was a wonderful evening.
- Too short.

114
00:11:27,017 --> 00:11:30,854
- Will you come and see me box?
- Of course.

115
00:11:33,107 --> 00:11:35,567
Did he try to kiss you?

116
00:11:35,984 --> 00:11:38,320
I don't know if he even thought about it.

117
00:11:39,113 --> 00:11:40,656
And I'm supposed to believe that!

118
00:11:40,864 --> 00:11:43,033
I'll come to see you sing.

119
00:11:47,079 --> 00:11:48,831
Goodnight.

120
00:11:53,168 --> 00:11:55,546
He's the love of my life...

121
00:13:28,513 --> 00:13:30,765
You were superb.

122
00:13:30,973 --> 00:13:34,977
Mr. Lucien Roupp, Mr. Cerdan's manager.

123
00:13:35,353 --> 00:13:38,981
Mr. Jameson, of CBS television.

124
00:13:54,288 --> 00:13:55,581
Marlene.

125
00:13:58,793 --> 00:14:03,089
Good evening. I'm sorry, I
just wanted to say something.

126
00:14:05,591 --> 00:14:08,469
I haven't been in Paris in years.

127
00:14:08,761 --> 00:14:14,141
But this evening, when you sang
I was right back there again..

128
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,228
...on her streets, beneath her skies.

129
00:14:17,645 --> 00:14:21,023
Your voice is the soul of Paris.

130
00:14:21,482 --> 00:14:25,736
You took me with you on your
travels. You brought tears to my eyes.

131
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:31,492
- Thank you, from the bottom of my heart.
- Thank you.

132
00:15:09,947 --> 00:15:11,531
Come on.

133
00:15:18,038 --> 00:15:22,918
I'm beginning to like this
city. The stars are out tonight.

134
00:15:23,543 --> 00:15:25,337
Let's go.

135
00:15:40,518 --> 00:15:44,606
Marc, do you know how long a frog lives for?

136
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:47,776
In fairytales or in real life?

137
00:15:50,403 --> 00:15:54,074
No one ever read me fairytales.

138
00:15:54,616 --> 00:15:57,202
You never had the chance to hear them.

139
00:15:58,286 --> 00:16:01,623
That's true, but all the same...

140
00:16:49,504 --> 00:16:53,674
Dreux. 13 December 1959

141
00:17:34,924 --> 00:17:36,342
I'm a little tired.

142
00:17:38,469 --> 00:17:39,595
I'll be right back.

143
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:01,575
Lay her down there.

144
00:18:09,583 --> 00:18:12,210
- I'll go back on in a minute.
- Out of the question.

145
00:18:12,419 --> 00:18:14,379
Nobody tells ME when to stop.

146
00:18:15,172 --> 00:18:18,717
- What are we going to do?
- Sorry, you'll have to clear the house.

147
00:18:19,259 --> 00:18:21,637
- I'm going back there!
- No, Edith.

148
00:18:21,845 --> 00:18:24,431
- I have to continue.
- It would be suicide.

149
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:25,974
You're going to hospital.

150
00:18:27,726 --> 00:18:30,937
No, I'm begging you!

151
00:18:31,146 --> 00:18:35,984
She left hospital only three
weeks ago. There'll be more galas.

152
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:39,946
Take me back to the stage.

153
00:18:40,697 --> 00:18:43,033
I have to sing.

154
00:18:43,241 --> 00:18:46,286
I have to sing, Louis. I have no choice.

155
00:18:47,162 --> 00:18:49,956
Edith, please...

156
00:18:50,582 --> 00:18:53,376
- Can't you hear them?
- Stop...

157
00:18:54,711 --> 00:18:56,004
Shut that door!

158
00:18:56,546 --> 00:18:58,173
Take me back there, Louis.

159
00:18:58,715 --> 00:19:02,469
If I don't sing tonight...

160
00:19:03,094 --> 00:19:10,059
If I don't sing one song at least, I'll
lose faith in myself. Do you follow?

161
00:19:25,325 --> 00:19:26,534
Doctor...

162
00:19:28,369 --> 00:19:30,121
...do what you have to do.

163
00:19:56,314 --> 00:19:59,567
Not this time, boys.

164
00:19:59,942 --> 00:20:03,362
You think I'm going to
collapse, but I'm in great shape.

165
00:20:03,571 --> 00:20:06,449
Don't you dare write that
this is my suicide tour!

166
00:20:11,871 --> 00:20:13,247
<i>'Padam'!</i>

167
00:21:43,879 --> 00:21:47,257
<i>Saint Theresa, first of all my thanks...</i>

168
00:21:48,175 --> 00:21:53,054
<i>I know you're behind it
all. You sent him to me.</i>

169
00:21:54,055 --> 00:21:57,892
<i>I've found love, thanks to you.</i>

170
00:21:58,727 --> 00:22:02,355
<i>Baby Jesus, protect Marcel.</i>

171
00:23:18,681 --> 00:23:19,890
Come on, Marcel!

172
00:23:22,351 --> 00:23:23,352
No!

173
00:23:23,728 --> 00:23:27,022
- It's too early, Edith.
- He's going to win. I feel it.

174
00:23:27,565 --> 00:23:29,817
- If things go wrong, you've a problem.
- What do you mean?

175
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:35,364
If there's no problem, I'll call you. Now go.

176
00:23:47,876 --> 00:23:49,169
Hurry up!

177
00:24:05,185 --> 00:24:06,854
Come on, Marcel!

178
00:24:23,579 --> 00:24:25,664
One more round!

179
00:24:40,721 --> 00:24:42,222
Come on, Marcel!

180
00:24:46,977 --> 00:24:48,520
Finish him off!

181
00:25:27,016 --> 00:25:29,602
- What's happening?
- Zale is sitting it out.

182
00:25:58,172 --> 00:26:00,550
Did he do it? Is he the world champion?

183
00:27:02,611 --> 00:27:04,738
You look like an angel.

184
00:27:06,615 --> 00:27:08,826
Not a fairy any more?

185
00:27:15,707 --> 00:27:17,584
You're my champion.

186
00:27:17,793 --> 00:27:20,295
I want to be with you always.

187
00:27:20,879 --> 00:27:24,341
There was nothing before I met
you. All that is in the past.

188
00:27:28,887 --> 00:27:30,639
Stay with me.

189
00:27:35,102 --> 00:27:39,356
<i>My dearest, before going to bed
last night I crossed off a day...</i>

190
00:27:39,564 --> 00:27:42,734
<i>...a day that was long and short.</i>

191
00:27:42,943 --> 00:27:48,865
<i>Such pain, that plane flew away
with my heart. My life, my breath...</i>

192
00:27:49,074 --> 00:27:52,369
<i>...my sweet boy, my child, my dearest love...</i>

193
00:27:52,577 --> 00:27:57,415
<i>...your scent is still on my sheets,
and my heart sleeps without waking...</i>

194
00:27:57,624 --> 00:27:59,876
<i>...in the arms of sadness.</i>

195
00:28:00,085 --> 00:28:04,673
<i>Darling, I love you. What have you done to me?</i>

196
00:28:04,965 --> 00:28:05,966
<i>I miss you.</i>

197
00:28:06,174 --> 00:28:10,637
<i>I'm depressed, lifeless, as
though I'm waiting for something...</i>

198
00:28:10,887 --> 00:28:18,645
<i>...hold me close against your heart and
know that nothing means more to me than you.</i>

199
00:28:19,062 --> 00:28:23,817
<i>Bring me back my heart.</i>

200
00:28:24,025 --> 00:28:27,737
<i>Whenever I'm in a restaurant
and hear 'La Vie en Rose'...</i>

201
00:28:27,946 --> 00:28:34,619
<i>If I see, my love, how devoted you
are to your wife and children...</i>

202
00:28:34,828 --> 00:28:36,788
<i>...I have the urge to go far away...</i>

203
00:28:36,996 --> 00:28:41,501
<i>...and perhaps one day you'll
be grateful for what I've done.</i>

204
00:28:41,709 --> 00:28:46,130
<i>I can't have you to myself
and I can't live without you.</i>

205
00:28:46,339 --> 00:28:50,093
<i>As God is my witness, I
ask nothing for myself...</i>

206
00:28:50,301 --> 00:28:52,929
<i>...and am prepared to sacrifice everything.</i>

207
00:28:54,847 --> 00:28:57,934
<i>'If life were to take you from me...</i>

208
00:28:58,142 --> 00:29:02,647
<i>...if you should die or be far away, and
you were to love me, I too would die. '</i>

209
00:29:07,527 --> 00:29:11,489
In three months' time,
wait for it, in April...

210
00:29:11,781 --> 00:29:16,494
<i>...I'm going to star in L'Olympia.
Full house and then we're back again.</i>

211
00:29:16,911 --> 00:29:20,665
Your liver is damaged...

212
00:29:20,873 --> 00:29:24,001
...you've been ill and need
rest. It's serious this time.

213
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:26,837
I'm only 44. I'm not dead yet.

214
00:29:27,046 --> 00:29:30,174
Because of all the cancellations we're broke.

215
00:29:30,383 --> 00:29:32,551
Oh, so it's my fault?

216
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:36,263
I didn't say that. The taxman
is breathing down our necks.

217
00:29:36,722 --> 00:29:39,600
<i>We have to pay 120.000 franc.</i>

218
00:29:40,184 --> 00:29:45,272
I only have jaundice! That won't
last 100 years. Don't exaggerate.

219
00:29:46,023 --> 00:29:48,901
<i>I want to sing in L'Olympia.</i>

220
00:29:55,658 --> 00:30:00,037
- Anything else?
- We shouldn't give in all the time.

221
00:30:00,246 --> 00:30:05,042
I can't watch her all the time. She
discharged herself too soon from hospital.

222
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:09,296
<i>L'Olympia is in 3 months.
That's going to be a disaster.</i>

223
00:30:09,505 --> 00:30:13,342
- She needs this sort of challenge.
- This is hopeless.

224
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:17,346
In that case I'll have to tell the
insurers that we're cancelling everything.

225
00:30:17,554 --> 00:30:21,433
We have to make the decisions for
her. Whether she likes it or not.

226
00:31:15,695 --> 00:31:19,157
<i>I said to myself, 'Edith, it's over. '</i>

227
00:31:19,366 --> 00:31:22,702
- There's someone else. You've lost him.
- Did he have an affair?

228
00:31:22,911 --> 00:31:25,914
I he did have, would I be telling you?

229
00:31:26,289 --> 00:31:28,833
He left the restaurant. I followed him.

230
00:31:29,042 --> 00:31:34,339
My Marcel walked the whole of New
York to eat with an old blind boxer...

231
00:31:34,547 --> 00:31:39,135
...whom he'd met a couple of
years before. Can you imagine that?

232
00:31:40,136 --> 00:31:45,934
- Men like that are scarce.
- My Marcel...

233
00:31:46,351 --> 00:31:49,729
...that's all you ever talk about.
That's the only thing that counts.

234
00:31:53,441 --> 00:31:57,904
But listen, Ginou, I'll never have him.

235
00:31:58,529 --> 00:32:02,575
He'll never be mine. He'll
remain with his wife and children.

236
00:32:08,164 --> 00:32:10,583
He phones her every day.

237
00:32:12,001 --> 00:32:16,130
I pretend I don't know what's
going on. I want him to be happy.

238
00:32:18,591 --> 00:32:19,926
I'll be right back.

239
00:32:25,348 --> 00:32:27,391
<i>I could have been Edith Piaf.</i>

240
00:32:28,142 --> 00:32:30,603
There's more in life than chansons.

241
00:32:41,947 --> 00:32:46,160
<i>It's been too long, Marcel! Call
Orly. Book a flight this evening.</i>

242
00:32:46,577 --> 00:32:51,415
I'd never survive it. I miss you, Marcel.

243
00:32:51,957 --> 00:32:54,502
I can't bear to be apart from you.

244
00:32:55,628 --> 00:32:59,215
- Perhaps I have to return to Paris.
- Hold on.

245
00:32:59,423 --> 00:33:03,344
- I'm no more than Madame's lapdog.
- Stop it...

246
00:33:05,429 --> 00:33:10,726
Rum, coke! Whisky! People think I'm rubbish.

247
00:33:11,727 --> 00:33:13,854
Getting drunk in Belleville was better.

248
00:33:17,066 --> 00:33:18,984
You abandoned me.

249
00:33:19,568 --> 00:33:21,153
That's enough, Momone!

250
00:33:23,530 --> 00:33:25,324
Take her away from here.

251
00:33:30,162 --> 00:33:32,039
I'm taking the boat.

252
00:33:32,915 --> 00:33:35,000
To your career, Edith!

253
00:33:40,505 --> 00:33:43,759
Marcel, leave tonight. For me.

254
00:34:35,769 --> 00:34:40,774
- You won't be sleeping if I'm not there.
- Thank God for that, Marcel.

255
00:34:51,117 --> 00:34:54,537
I'll make you coffee. You stay where you are.

256
00:35:01,085 --> 00:35:03,171
Let me serve you.

257
00:35:20,438 --> 00:35:22,440
What are you doing here?

258
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:42,376
I knew you'd come.

259
00:35:44,879 --> 00:35:47,840
Lucien found it hard to get tickets.

260
00:35:53,304 --> 00:35:55,055
I've a gift for you.

261
00:35:58,225 --> 00:36:02,479
You don't look too well. You could
do with some sun. You're pale.

262
00:36:11,822 --> 00:36:13,115
Ginou!

263
00:36:14,783 --> 00:36:16,827
I'm looking for that watch!

264
00:36:23,459 --> 00:36:26,795
Wat nou? I'm looking for that watch!

265
00:36:27,004 --> 00:36:31,216
In the red Cartier box.
Shit, it was right here!

266
00:36:40,601 --> 00:36:41,852
What's the matter with you?

267
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:46,023
I'm looking for Marcel's
watch! Where is that watch?

268
00:36:50,986 --> 00:36:55,198
I'm looking for Marcel's watch! What?

269
00:36:56,867 --> 00:37:00,454
Louis? What's the matter?

270
00:37:02,789 --> 00:37:05,000
I want you to be brave, Edith.

271
00:37:07,002 --> 00:37:08,545
Is it Marcel?

272
00:37:10,088 --> 00:37:11,465
What?

273
00:37:14,342 --> 00:37:16,344
The plane crashed...

274
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,573
Marcel!

275
00:37:39,659 --> 00:37:41,327
Marcel!

276
00:39:17,214 --> 00:39:19,633
What more can I tell you?

277
00:39:20,718 --> 00:39:22,511
They say you're the best clairvoyant there is.

278
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:27,725
This is your third visit this
week. I've told you all I know.

279
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:29,935
Why do you keep coming back?

280
00:39:31,729 --> 00:39:34,314
So you can tell me again.

281
00:39:35,774 --> 00:39:38,902
So that I know why I should continue living.

282
00:39:40,446 --> 00:39:43,574
He died in the air, so
that is where he must be...

283
00:39:55,794 --> 00:39:58,380
<i>California, August 1955</i>

284
00:40:06,805 --> 00:40:12,018
Jack Peals! Can we go any faster? I need air.

285
00:40:12,227 --> 00:40:14,813
I love the heat. It makes me dizzy.

286
00:40:15,730 --> 00:40:18,358
- Step on it. Our pin
- up is melting!

287
00:40:19,776 --> 00:40:25,282
I'm getting a sore throat. Then you can
take care of me. Like a good husband.

288
00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:29,244
- The best I've had.
- The FIRST you've had!

289
00:40:30,662 --> 00:40:33,456
Are you going to spend the day gawping at up?

290
00:40:37,002 --> 00:40:38,670
I'm feeling nauseous.

291
00:40:39,129 --> 00:40:42,132
Look out, you'll drive us off the road.

292
00:40:43,091 --> 00:40:48,638
Let me drive. Stop, I'll
drive. Then Ginou can throw up.

293
00:40:54,144 --> 00:40:55,103
Go on, Ginou.

294
00:40:56,604 --> 00:40:58,189
May I, Madame?

295
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,985
Go ahead, Ginou!

296
00:41:02,652 --> 00:41:04,904
Very good!

297
00:41:10,952 --> 00:41:12,078
Bye bye, Ginou!

298
00:41:12,996 --> 00:41:14,747
Wait for me!

299
00:41:18,751 --> 00:41:20,294
My, you're some driver.

300
00:41:23,464 --> 00:41:28,511
Our journey hasn't been wasted
after all. We just murdered a tree.

301
00:41:36,853 --> 00:41:41,566
My God, the service here is
awful. Can nobody take our order?

302
00:41:42,775 --> 00:41:47,738
<i>Take it easy. You're no star
here. Mocambo is tonight.</i>

303
00:41:47,947 --> 00:41:51,867
Remind me who invited us.

304
00:41:52,076 --> 00:41:55,997
Marlon Brando, Ginger Rogers, Mr. Chaplin...

305
00:41:59,959 --> 00:42:01,544
What's this?

306
00:42:03,254 --> 00:42:07,341
- We didn't order that swill!
- That's your cocktail.

307
00:42:16,642 --> 00:42:20,020
Don't touch me! I said don't touch me!

308
00:42:20,604 --> 00:42:22,439
Here, wipe it off.

309
00:42:25,067 --> 00:42:27,152
We should get a divorce.

310
00:42:32,032 --> 00:42:35,536
How many times a day are you shooting up now?

311
00:42:36,453 --> 00:42:38,163
About ten.

312
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:45,170
Excuse me for being so
direct, but why do you do it?

313
00:42:48,423 --> 00:42:50,634
So that my body doesn't protest.

314
00:42:54,429 --> 00:42:58,517
When did you start injecting every day?

315
00:42:58,725 --> 00:43:02,062
Five years ago, after the plane crash.

316
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:06,900
I contracted rheumatism.
I couldn't knit any more.

317
00:43:08,902 --> 00:43:11,822
You're very dependent on it.

318
00:43:12,781 --> 00:43:15,742
- It's an addiction...
- Doctor?

319
00:43:16,243 --> 00:43:18,912
I want my wife to kick the habit.

320
00:43:21,873 --> 00:43:25,210
I want to be well again. I can do it.

321
00:43:30,131 --> 00:43:34,678
October 1960 - 5 years later

322
00:43:55,698 --> 00:43:57,867
Danielle, a chair!

323
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:08,878
Edith?

324
00:44:16,052 --> 00:44:17,679
Here you are.

325
00:44:18,554 --> 00:44:20,056
Sit down now.

326
00:44:30,733 --> 00:44:32,068
Bruno...

327
00:44:37,907 --> 00:44:40,243
<i>...there won't be another L'Olympia.</i>

328
00:44:46,958 --> 00:44:48,543
I understand.

329
00:45:00,513 --> 00:45:01,806
No!

330
00:45:10,314 --> 00:45:15,402
The composer Charles Dumont and the
lyricist Michel Vaucaire are here.

331
00:45:15,611 --> 00:45:18,864
<i>They wish us to hear their chanson.</i>

332
00:45:26,997 --> 00:45:29,333
Quickly then. I'm tired.

333
00:45:47,184 --> 00:45:51,772
<i>no, no nothing at all</i>

334
00:45:53,398 --> 00:45:56,860

335
00:45:57,945 --> 00:46:02,532
<i>not the good times I had</i>

336
00:46:03,075 --> 00:46:06,995
<i>not the pain it means nothing to me</i>

337
00:46:07,204 --> 00:46:08,580
Stop!

338
00:46:09,831 --> 00:46:13,377
I love it. Carry on!

339
00:46:14,252 --> 00:46:16,963
<i>with my souvenirs</i>

340
00:46:17,547 --> 00:46:20,175

00:46:25,430 --> 00:46:27,891

344
00:46:28,100 --> 00:46:30,477

00:46:30,685 --> 00:46:33,355

You're wonderful!

348
00:46:37,234 --> 00:46:41,363
That's precisely what I was looking
out for. Unbelievable. This is so ME!

349
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:44,449
That is MY life. That is me!

350
00:46:44,783 --> 00:46:50,038
<i>Call Coquatrix. L'Olympia is on!
Play it again. It's exquisite.</i>

351
00:46:50,580 --> 00:46:54,376
<i>no, no nothing at all</i>

352

<i>You're doing well, my dear.
Your friend, Marguerite'</i>

354
00:47:24,656 --> 00:47:28,076
Aznavour, Mr. Cocteau, Yves Montand.

355
00:47:28,284 --> 00:47:31,412
Montand's here? I read that he wasn't coming.

356
00:47:31,621 --> 00:47:32,830
He's come for you!

357
00:47:33,039 --> 00:47:37,251
- They've been waiting a half hour.
- The room is jumping.

358
00:47:49,180 --> 00:47:51,015
Not too tight?

359
00:47:53,726 --> 00:47:56,604
- Who's that?
- A friend.

360
00:48:18,125 --> 00:48:20,294
Let's go, Edith.

361
00:48:20,544 --> 00:48:21,837
Up you get.

362
00:48:27,635 --> 00:48:29,011
My crucifix?

363
00:48:30,888 --> 00:48:31,889
My crucifix...

364
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:35,726
My crucifix?

365
00:48:35,935 --> 00:48:39,063
- I forgot. I'll fetch it.
- I won't sing without it.

366
00:48:40,189 --> 00:48:42,858
Everybody out!

367
00:49:53,762 --> 00:49:58,141
<i>Grasse, Oktober 1963 The Final Night</i>

368
00:49:58,475 --> 00:49:59,851
See you tomorrow.

369
00:50:00,060 --> 00:50:01,686
I'll do it.

370
00:50:07,192 --> 00:50:12,822
I'm afraid, Simone. I'm losing
my memory. It's serious this time.

371
00:50:14,282 --> 00:50:16,784
My brain is confused.

372
00:50:17,202 --> 00:50:22,790
I try to remember things but they won't come.

373
00:50:24,584 --> 00:50:28,713
Things do come, but not the things I want.

374
00:50:31,591 --> 00:50:35,887
I wanted to see his watch. Don't
you remember? Marcel's watch?

375
00:50:36,095 --> 00:50:41,184
- I'm afraid not. I never knew him.
- I wanted to see his watch...

376
00:50:59,869 --> 00:51:01,621
What a face!

377
00:51:03,372 --> 00:51:05,249
You have wild eyes.

378
00:51:08,628 --> 00:51:10,504
I like the little one.

379
00:51:45,331 --> 00:51:48,375
- Simone?
- Yes, Edith?

380
00:51:50,794 --> 00:51:53,047
I haven't said my prayers.

381
00:51:56,175 --> 00:51:59,052
I must get down on my knees and pray.

382
00:51:59,511 --> 00:52:03,891
No one will think less of you if
you don't get down on your knees.

383
00:52:04,224 --> 00:52:07,060
I wish to pray for my papa.

384
00:53:10,206 --> 00:53:11,583
Marcelle...

385
00:53:13,209 --> 00:53:14,461
Marcelle...

386
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:17,505
...my little ghost...

387
00:53:19,591 --> 00:53:24,387
Only Momone knows. I must
tell you about my ghost.

388
00:53:24,596 --> 00:53:27,473
- Take it easy, Edith.
- Marcelle!

389
00:53:36,607 --> 00:53:40,028
Marcelle, go to bed. Enough for today.

390
00:53:40,236 --> 00:53:46,284
And I'm supposed to look out for the
police... and your child! What Louis up to?

391
00:53:47,702 --> 00:53:49,245
It's your father.

392
00:53:54,167 --> 00:53:55,418
Has she eaten?

393
00:53:55,710 --> 00:53:59,547
- They're saying you were on the street with her.
- Who says that?

394
00:53:59,755 --> 00:54:03,009
You only have her twice a month
and you can't even do THAT right!

395
00:54:03,259 --> 00:54:04,844
not on the street!

396
00:54:14,645 --> 00:54:15,521
Come quick.

397
00:54:18,524 --> 00:54:19,275
It's Marcelle! Come quick!

398
00:54:24,071 --> 00:54:25,656
She's in the hospital!

399
00:54:48,345 --> 00:54:50,306
Are you her mother?

400
00:54:50,889 --> 00:54:55,853
Meningitis. We could do nothing. I'm sorry.

401
00:55:30,429 --> 00:55:31,930
Edith?

402
00:55:33,432 --> 00:55:35,308
I have the crucifix.

403
00:55:54,077 --> 00:55:56,580
They told me you were on the beach.

404
00:55:57,497 --> 00:56:01,710
- Thanks for agreeing to this interview.
- My pleasure.

405
00:56:02,836 --> 00:56:05,380
How strange to meet you so far from Paris.

406
00:56:05,588 --> 00:56:08,091
I'm never far from Paris.

407
00:56:09,009 --> 00:56:14,264
I have a list of question. Just say
the first thing that occurs to you.

408
00:56:20,603 --> 00:56:24,190
- What is your favourite colour?
- Blue.

409
00:56:24,399 --> 00:56:28,403
- Your favourite food?
- Roast beef.

410
00:56:30,071 --> 00:56:35,326
- Would you like to live sensibly?
- I already do.

411
00:56:39,580 --> 00:56:44,544
<i>Who are your most loyal friends?
All my genuine friends.</i>

412
00:56:46,838 --> 00:56:49,590
<i>If you were unable to sing...</i>

413
00:56:50,299 --> 00:56:53,720
<i>Then I could no longer live.</i>

414
00:56:54,762 --> 00:56:56,722
<i>Are you afraid of death?</i>

415
00:56:58,224 --> 00:57:00,726
<i>I'm more afraid of loneliness.</i>

416
00:57:02,270 --> 00:57:07,191
- Do you pray?
- Yes, for I believe in love.

417
00:57:08,401 --> 00:57:10,444
I don't want to, Simone.

418
00:57:11,445 --> 00:57:15,283
Where's Theo? I want my husband.

419
00:57:15,574 --> 00:57:18,077
Theo will be here in less than an hour.

420
00:57:19,161 --> 00:57:22,039
What was the finest part of the show for you?

421
00:57:22,999 --> 00:57:25,209
When the curtain went up.

422
00:57:40,850 --> 00:57:43,185
And as a woman?

423
00:57:44,436 --> 00:57:46,522
My first kiss.

424
00:57:48,607 --> 00:57:53,320
- Do you like the night?
- Yes, with lots of light.

425
00:57:53,529 --> 00:57:58,242
- The morning?
- With a piano and friends.

426
00:57:58,450 --> 00:57:59,702
The evening?

427
00:57:59,952 --> 00:58:02,746
Because that's our morning.

428
00:58:08,293 --> 00:58:10,462
You see, you're breathing.

429
00:58:18,470 --> 00:58:20,472
I can't go back.

430
00:58:24,393 --> 00:58:26,228
I can't.

431
00:59:05,308 --> 00:59:09,020
<i>What advice would you give a woman?</i>

432
00:59:10,438 --> 00:59:11,815
<i>Love.</i>

433
00:59:12,065 --> 00:59:14,985
- To a young girl?
- Love.

434
00:59:15,193 --> 00:59:18,655
- To a child?
- Love.

435
00:59:21,783 --> 00:59:23,993
Whom are you knitting for?

436
00:59:25,662 --> 00:59:28,540
For anyone who'll wear my sweaters.

437
00:59:30,250 --> 00:59:34,087
That's it. I hope it wasn't too long.

438
00:59:36,381 --> 00:59:39,926
- Thank you so much, madame.
- Thank you too.
