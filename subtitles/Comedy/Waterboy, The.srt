{45140}{45210}anybody else?|Yes, sir. You, sir.
{45230}{45316}alligators are aggressive because|of an enlarged medulla oblongata.

{45403}{45499}- That is correct!|The medulla oblongata.|- But Mama said--
{45528}{45595}The medulla oblongata...
{45654}{45767}is where anger, jealousy|and aggression come from.

{46097}{46208}all right, let's hear what|Mama has to say on the subject.

{121625}{121713}and the big story here, Dan, is a game|that's lost some of its luster...

{121852}{121917}You know, Red's got a couple|of solid early rounders out there.

{131971}{132036}- Dan, this is bizarre.|- [Dan] No, it's not, Brent.
{132055}{132134}It’s brilliant, because Red is|taking the waterboy out of the game.
{132160}{132219}By kneeling down|three times and punting,
{132239}{132286}he's gonna make the Mud Dog|offence try to beat him.
{132301}{132358}and the way they're playing|today, that's impossible.
{132375}{132424}[Musburger] Well, the Mud Dog's|most valuable player,
{132440}{132515}the linebacker they call ''the Waterboy,''|is now powerless.
{132540}{132663}That means Coach Klein will have|to find another way to outfox Red.

{136117}{136198}We go from a championship|football team to a bunch of dogs!

{136746}{136794}Mud Dogs are gonna win,|30 to 27.
{136810}{136874}That's very interesting.|How'd you come up with that guess?
{136895}{136975}Guess? That ain't no guess!|That's what it's gonna be.
{136999}{137069}- Okay. That's fine.|- Oh! Be careful down there, Swannie.

{137335}{137420}- Get in there and let's see if|that waterboy can stop you.|- Yes, sir!
{137444}{137545}Red is sending his best defender in|as a running back?
{137575}{137634}What do you make of this, Dan?
{137652}{137705}Well, Brent, he's gotta find|some way to neutralize the waterboy.
{137724}{137804}He probably thinks that Meaney|will just pound it in there like|Fridge used to do for the Bears.
{137829}{137915}Hey, Waterboy! Is your girlfriend|gonna save you again?

{145857}{145900}[Fouts] Yeah, this is|a real gutsy call, Brent.
{145916}{145962}He'll either be a hero|or a goat because of this.
