MAN:
Assistant Professor Thurber,

3
00:01:33,559 --> 00:01:36,128
First, on behalf
of the tenure committee

4
00:01:36,162 --> 00:01:37,196
And Grey College,

5
00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:38,597
I would like to thank you

6
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:40,266
For your services
these past three years.

7
00:01:40,299 --> 00:01:41,867
Thank you,
Dean Leakey.

8
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:44,836
CHARLIE: 12 years
teaching college.

9
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:48,507
Up for tenure again...
A job for life.

10
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:52,178
Before this, there was
Bowdoin and Union.

11
00:01:52,211 --> 00:01:54,146
This may be
my last chance.

12
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,748
Friggin' Grey College.

13
00:01:56,782 --> 00:01:59,651
Motherfuckin'
Grey College.

14
00:02:07,426 --> 00:02:09,261
Hi.
Hi.

15
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:12,364
Dude!
Where you been?

16
00:02:13,832 --> 00:02:15,401
Sorry.

17
00:02:15,434 --> 00:02:18,370
I'm almost up.
I know.

18
00:02:18,404 --> 00:02:20,439
What do you think?
Maybe... lose the shades?

19
00:02:20,472 --> 00:02:22,808
My Oakleys?
No way, man.

20
00:02:22,841 --> 00:02:24,376
Okay.

21
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:25,811
Nervous?

22
00:02:25,844 --> 00:02:27,779
What do I have to be
nervous about?

23
00:02:27,813 --> 00:02:31,217
It's only my entire
academic career
on the line.

24
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:33,852
Of course I'm nervous,
jack-off.

25
00:02:33,885 --> 00:02:36,222
Steve Kim's been
in there two hours.

26
00:02:36,255 --> 00:02:37,689
Really?

27
00:02:37,723 --> 00:02:39,958
Okay, just remember what
I told you, all right?

28
00:02:39,991 --> 00:02:41,293
Not the end
of the world

29
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:42,828
If you don't get this.

30
00:02:42,861 --> 00:02:44,463
Yeah, well, if you
don't get tenure

31
00:02:44,496 --> 00:02:45,931
At Grey College...

32
00:02:45,964 --> 00:02:48,234
[Clears throat]

33
00:02:48,267 --> 00:02:49,635

good-bye.

34
00:02:51,737 --> 00:02:53,939
Steve.
Steve.

35
00:02:55,607 --> 00:02:57,909
Shake it off, okay?

36
00:02:57,943 --> 00:03:01,247
Whew. I got a good
feeling about this.

37
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,748
You're a great teacher.

38
00:03:02,781 --> 00:03:03,949
Professor Hadley?

39
00:03:03,982 --> 00:03:06,452
The tenure committee
is waiting.

40
00:03:06,485 --> 00:03:07,919
[Whispers]
Great teacher.

41
00:03:11,457 --> 00:03:13,292
JAY: Hi, everyone.

00:03:13,325 --> 00:03:14,793

CHARLIE: Oh, hey, guys.

44
00:03:16,762 --> 00:03:18,330
Where's Dr. Hadley?

45
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:19,665
You just missed him.

46
00:03:26,305 --> 00:03:27,839
We made cookies
and everything.

47
00:03:27,873 --> 00:03:29,441
Oh, that's nice.

48
00:03:30,942 --> 00:03:32,244
May I?

49
00:03:32,278 --> 00:03:35,381
[Clears throat]
Oh, yeah.

50
00:03:38,817 --> 00:03:41,387
So, that's Bigfoot?

51
00:03:43,355 --> 00:03:45,257
How can I just get
one vote?

52
00:03:47,025 --> 00:03:48,994
One vote out of 12.

53
00:03:49,027 --> 00:03:50,629
That's a joke.

54
00:03:52,731 --> 00:03:54,533
I wonder who
voted for you.

55
00:03:58,537 --> 00:04:01,907
I mean, I really thought
I had a chance.
Didn't you?

56
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:04,376
I thought you were a lock.

57
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,378
What has Steve Kim
ever done

58
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:08,013
For the anthropological
community?

59
00:04:08,046 --> 00:04:09,748
Steve Kim... come on.

60
00:04:09,781 --> 00:04:11,717
I mean,
I produced evidence

61
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,652
Of a genuine Sasquatch.

62
00:04:15,754 --> 00:04:16,955
[Tape plays]

63
00:04:23,362 --> 00:04:26,332
There! Look.

64
00:04:26,365 --> 00:04:29,401
Right there.
Yeah.

65
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:30,769
You come over here
and tell me

66
00:04:30,802 --> 00:04:32,704
That that is not
the hind leg

67
00:04:32,738 --> 00:04:34,906
Of an Appalachian
Sasquatch. Seriously.

68
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:38,410
I just don't see
anything, Jay.

69
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:39,745
I'm sorry.

70
00:04:39,778 --> 00:04:41,046
What?!

71
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:42,614
It's right here, man!

72
00:04:42,648 --> 00:04:44,950
That looks like
a tree.

73
00:04:44,983 --> 00:04:46,952
It's not a fuckin'
tree, Charlie!

74
00:04:46,985 --> 00:04:49,054
Come on!
It's Bigfoot!

75
00:04:49,087 --> 00:04:51,089
[Sighs]
I saw him.

76
00:04:51,122 --> 00:04:53,291
I was there.

77
00:04:54,393 --> 00:04:56,595
I'm the guy
runnin' the camera.

78
00:04:57,663 --> 00:04:59,898
It's right here.

79
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:03,535
Sasquatch weather, man.
Look for tracks.

80
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:04,770
Where are we going?

81
00:05:04,803 --> 00:05:06,071
Relax, man.

82
00:05:06,104 --> 00:05:07,906
It's my party,
remember?

83
00:05:07,939 --> 00:05:10,108
I just thought
it was gonna more
of an indoor thing.

84
00:05:10,141 --> 00:05:11,677
Dude.

85
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:13,379
Roll with it, okay?
Sorry.

86
00:05:13,412 --> 00:05:15,481
I just got dealt
a hammer blow to the nuts.

87
00:05:15,514 --> 00:05:17,416
I know, I know.

88
00:05:17,449 --> 00:05:19,385
Besides, it's not like
you got anybody

89
00:05:19,418 --> 00:05:20,786
Waiting up for you.

90
00:05:20,819 --> 00:05:22,320
Why did you have
to say that?

91
00:05:26,925 --> 00:05:28,694
Just tell me where
we're going, Jay.

92
00:05:28,727 --> 00:05:30,729
Dean Leakey's.
Why?

93
00:05:33,765 --> 00:05:35,401
Come on!

94
00:05:47,178 --> 00:05:49,114
CHARLIE:
It is with great pride

95
00:05:49,147 --> 00:05:52,451
That I look back on
the last three years
at Grey College.

96
00:05:52,484 --> 00:05:55,153
I strongly believe
that I deserve tenure,

97
00:05:55,186 --> 00:05:56,922
And through this
personal statement,

98
00:05:56,955 --> 00:05:58,657
I hope the committee
will get to know me

99
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:00,792
A little better...
My accomplishments,

100
00:06:00,826 --> 00:06:03,862
My dreams, and my myriad
contributions

101
00:06:03,895 --> 00:06:07,499
To the academic community
at Grey College.

102
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:08,834
Huh?

103
00:06:08,867 --> 00:06:11,136
"Myriad contributions"?

104
00:06:17,443 --> 00:06:20,612
Okay, we're gonna start
a new novel this week.

105
00:06:20,646 --> 00:06:22,147
It's called The Magus,

106
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:25,484
By an English writer
named John Fowles.

107
00:06:25,517 --> 00:06:27,486
Anybody heard of
The Magus?

108
00:06:28,987 --> 00:06:31,990
No? Well, some people...
Smart people...

109
00:06:32,023 --> 00:06:34,526
Think it's one of the best
novels ever written.

110
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,562
Then how come we've
never heard of it?

111
00:06:36,595 --> 00:06:38,530
I... I don't know, Robin,

112
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:41,433
But if you all would like
to read the same books

113
00:06:41,467 --> 00:06:43,201
That every other college kid
in America is reading,

114
00:06:43,234 --> 00:06:44,936
We can do that.

115
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:47,005
Let's see, uh...
Catcher in the Rye.

116
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:49,508
Yeah, let's examine why
"Fuck you" is written

117
00:06:49,541 --> 00:06:51,843
Is written on
the bathroom wall... again.

118
00:06:51,877 --> 00:06:53,812
No, look,
I pick the books I read

119
00:06:53,845 --> 00:06:55,647
Back when I was like you...

120
00:06:55,681 --> 00:06:57,449
Misguided, morose...

121
00:06:57,483 --> 00:06:59,585
You're still morose.

122
00:06:59,618 --> 00:07:01,920
Anyhow, The Magus.

123
00:07:01,953 --> 00:07:03,722
You all might not
have heard of it,

124
00:07:03,755 --> 00:07:05,557
But it changed my life.

125
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:07,192
It has a little bit
of everything.

126
00:07:07,225 --> 00:07:09,127
It has love,

127
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,463
And exotic locales.

128
00:07:11,497 --> 00:07:13,031
It even has
a little bit of sex.

129
00:07:13,064 --> 00:07:15,767
Ooh, Stan's
gonna like it.

130
00:07:15,801 --> 00:07:17,202
Shut up, Ben.

131
00:07:17,235 --> 00:07:18,804
Yeah, Ben,
take it easy, okay?

132
00:07:20,238 --> 00:07:22,608
Excuse me.
That's Professor Hadley.

133
00:07:23,975 --> 00:07:26,444
[Whispering] Dude,
we hit the wrong pad.

134
00:07:28,146 --> 00:07:29,447
Excuse me.

135
00:07:30,982 --> 00:07:32,951
I'm in the middle of
a class here, dude.

136
00:07:32,984 --> 00:07:35,186
What do you mean,
we hit the wrong pad?

137
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,822
I guess our recon
was off.

138
00:07:36,855 --> 00:07:38,189
Our recon?

139
00:07:38,223 --> 00:07:39,825
All right, mine.

140
00:07:39,858 --> 00:07:41,560
I just feel bad.

141
00:07:41,593 --> 00:07:42,894
Dean Leakey's
next-door neighbor

142
00:07:42,928 --> 00:07:44,563
Never did
anything to us.

143
00:07:44,596 --> 00:07:46,498
Dean Leakey's
next-door neighbor?

144
00:07:46,532 --> 00:07:48,233
Yeah, man.
He's in a wheelchair.

145
00:07:48,266 --> 00:07:49,768
Jesus, Jay!

146
00:07:49,801 --> 00:07:51,937
Yeah. Veteran.

147
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:53,772
Hero. Purple Heart.

148
00:07:53,805 --> 00:07:55,641
I gotta talk
to you later.

149
00:07:55,674 --> 00:07:57,108
All right.

150
00:08:07,185 --> 00:08:09,521
Professor Thurber?

151
00:08:09,555 --> 00:08:11,823
Hey, Stan.
What's up?

152
00:08:11,857 --> 00:08:13,959
We need a new
faculty adviser

153
00:08:13,992 --> 00:08:15,894
For the poetry club.

154
00:08:15,927 --> 00:08:17,663
I'm president.
Wow.

155
00:08:17,696 --> 00:08:20,231
Well, what happened
to the old adviser?

156
00:08:20,265 --> 00:08:21,266
He died.

157
00:08:21,299 --> 00:08:25,036
Oh, yeah... Dr. Churchill.
Sorry, I...

158
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:27,272
Wasn't that last year,
though?

159
00:08:27,305 --> 00:08:29,274
We never got a new one.

160
00:08:29,307 --> 00:08:31,109
Well, Stan...

161
00:08:31,142 --> 00:08:33,078
Look, I gotta be
honest with you.

162
00:08:33,111 --> 00:08:35,647
I've never been
a huge poetry guy.

163
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:39,017
So, I think
the best thing to do

164
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:40,786
Would be for me
to take a pass on it,

165
00:08:40,819 --> 00:08:43,254
Just in fairness to you
and to the club.

166
00:08:43,288 --> 00:08:44,790
Okay?

167
00:08:44,823 --> 00:08:46,257
Thank you.

168
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:48,660
Thanks, man. Okay.

169
00:09:14,653 --> 00:09:16,121
Son of a bitch.

170
00:09:16,154 --> 00:09:18,189
Fuckin' kids.

171
00:09:31,837 --> 00:09:32,971
[Beep]

172
00:09:33,004 --> 00:09:34,773
Charlie, it's Margaret.

173
00:09:34,806 --> 00:09:36,842
Remember me... your sister?

174
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:38,376
Dad told me that
he hasn't seen you

175
00:09:38,409 --> 00:09:40,245
In almost two weeks.

176
00:09:40,278 --> 00:09:41,913
The reason we put him
in that facility

177
00:09:41,947 --> 00:09:43,715
Was because
it was close to you.

178
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:45,784
I'm not gonna bring up
the whole money thing,
Charlie,

179
00:09:45,817 --> 00:09:47,853
But you said this was
the only way that
you could contribute.

180
00:09:47,886 --> 00:09:50,121
You promised you'd visit him
at least once a week.

181
00:09:50,155 --> 00:09:51,723
So do it, Charlie!

182
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:53,759
Oh, and I almost forgot
the best part.

183
00:09:53,792 --> 00:09:55,627
I got a call from
a lady over there

184
00:09:55,661 --> 00:09:57,395
Who claims that Dad's been
making prank phone calls

185
00:09:57,428 --> 00:09:59,731
To PBS telethons
or something.

186
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:01,967
She said he's lonely
and he just wants to talk,

187
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,369
So... I don't know.
It's nothing weird.

188
00:10:04,402 --> 00:10:07,138
I mean, yes, it is.
It is fucking weird.

189
00:10:07,172 --> 00:10:08,974
But it's not perverted,
thank God.

190
00:10:09,007 --> 00:10:10,709
So you need to talk
to him about that.

191
00:10:10,742 --> 00:10:12,310
God, do you have
a cell phone yet?

192
00:10:12,343 --> 00:10:13,745
[Beep]

193
00:10:43,241 --> 00:10:44,876
[Moaning]

194
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:46,712
[Thudding]

195
00:10:50,181 --> 00:10:51,850
Hey, Dad?

196
00:10:51,883 --> 00:10:54,419
Dad, you in there?

197
00:10:54,452 --> 00:10:55,954
Dad?

198
00:10:57,322 --> 00:10:58,656
Dad?

199
00:11:05,363 --> 00:11:07,232
Dad!
Huh?

200
00:11:07,265 --> 00:11:08,700
Huh?

201
00:11:11,336 --> 00:11:13,705
This place is
chock full of widows.

202
00:11:13,739 --> 00:11:15,373
Like Sue in there.

203
00:11:15,406 --> 00:11:17,142
She's Canadian.

204
00:11:17,175 --> 00:11:19,778
Did you ever make love to
a native French speaker?

205
00:11:19,811 --> 00:11:21,279
Dad, can we please talk
about something else?

206
00:11:21,312 --> 00:11:23,148
Sure we can.

207
00:11:23,181 --> 00:11:25,784
Sure we can...
Whatever you want.

208
00:11:25,817 --> 00:11:30,088
I so treasure these
monthly visits, Charlie.

209
00:11:30,121 --> 00:11:33,424
Well, Margaret called,
and...

210
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:35,961
She said you didn't
sound so good.

211
00:11:35,994 --> 00:11:37,796
Well, how do you feel?

212
00:11:37,829 --> 00:11:39,364
I feel fine.
Okay.

213
00:11:39,397 --> 00:11:42,834
Fine as I can feel
in this goddamn place.

214
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:44,169
It's not so bad.

215
00:11:44,202 --> 00:11:47,105
Oh, what the hell do you
know about anything?

216
00:11:47,138 --> 00:11:49,174
When I was your age,

217
00:11:49,207 --> 00:11:51,176
I was a tenured
professor of English

218
00:11:51,209 --> 00:11:53,044
At Princeton University.

219
00:11:53,078 --> 00:11:54,746
Really?
I didn't know that.

220
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:57,315
Don't get smart
with me.

221
00:11:57,348 --> 00:12:00,385
[Sighs] You should be
further along.

222
00:12:01,787 --> 00:12:03,889
So... what about tenure?

223
00:12:03,922 --> 00:12:05,891
Come on, Dad.
We've been through this.

224
00:12:05,924 --> 00:12:07,859
I'm on the fast track
at Grey,

225
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:10,028
And I find out
in May, so...

226
00:12:10,061 --> 00:12:11,830
[Clears throat]

227
00:12:11,863 --> 00:12:13,498
Well, you were on
the fast track
at Bowdoin, too.

228
00:12:13,531 --> 00:12:14,966
It's gonna happen.

229
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,968
Christ, I'd hate
to see the slow track.

230
00:12:17,002 --> 00:12:18,736
It's gonna happen.

231
00:12:45,363 --> 00:12:46,865
Let's take some ecstasy.

232
00:12:48,133 --> 00:12:50,235
What?

233
00:12:50,268 --> 00:12:52,337
Let's take some ecstasy.

234
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:54,439
I bought it off this kid
in my Anthro 101.

235
00:12:54,472 --> 00:12:56,007
Jay, that is idiotic.

236
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:57,775
You could get fired
for that.

237
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:00,946
That's just rude, man.

238
00:13:02,147 --> 00:13:03,815
You know what I meant.

239
00:13:03,849 --> 00:13:05,817
Come on. I heard about
this cool student party

240
00:13:05,851 --> 00:13:06,651
Way off campus.

241
00:13:06,684 --> 00:13:08,987
You're still a member
of the faculty.

242
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:10,588
And so am I.

243
00:13:10,621 --> 00:13:12,390
Dude, just
drop me off, then.

244
00:13:12,423 --> 00:13:13,524
I don't have a car.

245
00:13:13,558 --> 00:13:14,826
I'm sorry, man.

246
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:16,461
I've got to work
on my article

247
00:13:16,494 --> 00:13:18,263
And my personal
statement.

248
00:13:18,296 --> 00:13:20,031
That's cool.

249
00:13:21,499 --> 00:13:23,101
I'll just hang here.

250
00:13:24,936 --> 00:13:26,437
With you.

251
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:29,174
No, don't. I mean it.

252
00:13:29,207 --> 00:13:30,575
I don't think
you should...

253
00:13:30,608 --> 00:13:31,943
Mmm.

254
00:13:33,011 --> 00:13:34,880
Jesus.

255
00:13:36,281 --> 00:13:38,149
CHARLIE:
You sure this is it?

256
00:13:38,183 --> 00:13:39,617
JAY: Yeah, they said
it was in the backyard,

257
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:41,219
In the woods and shit.

258
00:13:41,252 --> 00:13:43,188
Outside? I don't even
have my jacket.

259
00:13:43,221 --> 00:13:45,590
I'm not cold at all.

260
00:13:45,623 --> 00:13:48,459
Fuck, I think
it's starting to work.

261
00:13:48,493 --> 00:13:49,995
Touch my face.
No.

262
00:13:50,028 --> 00:13:51,930
It's unbelievable.
Touch my face.

263
00:13:51,963 --> 00:13:53,231
Come on.

264
00:13:53,264 --> 00:13:55,000
Whew!
Take it easy.

265
00:13:55,033 --> 00:13:56,167
Come on, touch it.

266
00:13:56,201 --> 00:13:58,203
[* Rock music playing]

267
00:14:01,072 --> 00:14:02,974
Professor Thurber?

268
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:05,343
Hey, Robin,
how you doing?
Good.

269
00:14:05,376 --> 00:14:07,012
Oh, my God.
What are you doing here?

270
00:14:07,045 --> 00:14:09,514
Nothin'. Just kind of
checking in.

271
00:14:10,982 --> 00:14:13,018
I'm gonna head
to the woods.

272
00:14:16,454 --> 00:14:19,157
Shouldn't you be at home,
doing your reading?

273
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:20,658
It's Friday.

274
00:14:20,691 --> 00:14:22,627
Right, sorry.
Excuse me.

275
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:25,163
Besides, I already
finished The Magus.

276
00:14:25,196 --> 00:14:27,933
Wow, that was quick.
So, what'd you think?

277
00:14:27,966 --> 00:14:30,668
Uh... it had
a lot of sex in it.

278
00:14:30,701 --> 00:14:33,604
Really? Did you...
You thought that?

279
00:14:33,638 --> 00:14:35,907
I mean,
it's not all sex.

280
00:14:35,941 --> 00:14:37,542
I think that
there are, you know,

281
00:14:37,575 --> 00:14:39,444
Larger themes at work.

282
00:14:39,477 --> 00:14:41,646
I really like your class.
Thank you, Robin.

283
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:44,215
It's, like, the best class
I have at Grey.

284
00:14:44,249 --> 00:14:45,683
It's a great group
of kids.

285
00:14:45,716 --> 00:14:48,019
Except Ben.
[Laughs]

286
00:14:49,487 --> 00:14:51,156
Do you think I'm fat?

287
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:54,025
Of course not.

288
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:55,626
Why... Why would you
say that?

289
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:57,628
This guy...

290
00:14:57,662 --> 00:14:59,697
This asshole...

291
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:01,232
Look, Robin...

292
00:15:01,266 --> 00:15:02,567
Heh.

293
00:15:04,535 --> 00:15:06,537
You're a very...

294
00:15:06,571 --> 00:15:08,573
Attractive girl.

295
00:15:08,606 --> 00:15:10,008
All right?

296
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:12,477
So don't let anybody
tell you otherwise.

297
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:13,644
Okay?

298
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,481
Do you have a girlfriend?

299
00:15:16,514 --> 00:15:19,717
Um, no.
Not right now.

300
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:21,953
Don't you get lonely?

301
00:15:21,987 --> 00:15:24,489
I... Yeah, sure I do.

302
00:15:24,522 --> 00:15:26,024
I mean, just like
everybody...

303
00:15:26,057 --> 00:15:27,358
So do I.
Yeah.

304
00:15:28,726 --> 00:15:30,128
Well...

305
00:15:30,161 --> 00:15:32,497
I should go find
Professor Hadley.

306
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:34,032
But it was great
talking to you.

307
00:15:34,065 --> 00:15:35,967
And, uh,
I'll see you Monday.

308
00:15:36,001 --> 00:15:38,369
Hi, Stan.
How you doing?

309
00:15:38,403 --> 00:15:39,704
Can you drive me home?

310
00:15:39,737 --> 00:15:41,939
Nope, gotta go.

311
00:15:43,441 --> 00:15:45,510
Jay!

312
00:15:45,543 --> 00:15:47,245
Jay!

313
00:15:47,278 --> 00:15:48,946
Come on, man!

314
00:15:50,648 --> 00:15:52,717
JAY: Up here, man.

315
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,285
Jay?

316
00:15:55,786 --> 00:15:57,455
JAY: Up here, man!

317
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:05,430
Come on up, man.
It's unreal.

318
00:16:11,169 --> 00:16:14,572
JAY: I've spent days
up in trees...

319
00:16:14,605 --> 00:16:16,107
Waiting for Bigfoot.

320
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:19,310
That's great, Jay.

321
00:16:19,344 --> 00:16:21,012
Should we
head home now?

322
00:16:21,046 --> 00:16:22,780
What do you think?

323
00:16:22,813 --> 00:16:25,016
It's about the passion,
you know?

324
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:27,318
Yes. Passion.

325
00:16:27,352 --> 00:16:30,788
You think Steve Kim
ever spent four days
in a tree?

326
00:16:30,821 --> 00:16:32,723
Probably not, no.

327
00:16:32,757 --> 00:16:34,792
And he got tenure.

328
00:16:34,825 --> 00:16:36,794
Yeah, it's, uh...

329
00:16:36,827 --> 00:16:38,429
It's messed up.

330
00:16:38,463 --> 00:16:40,231
Passion isn't enough
anymore.

331
00:16:40,265 --> 00:16:42,067
That's what's
messed up.

332
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:44,235
It's not about
the classroom.

333
00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:46,037
It's not about
the kids.

334
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:48,306
What do you think
my chances are?

335
00:16:48,339 --> 00:16:50,675
For tenure?
Yeah.

336
00:16:52,143 --> 00:16:54,612
Dude, you're running
unopposed.

337
00:16:54,645 --> 00:16:57,615
I haven't published
anything in over a year.

338
00:16:57,648 --> 00:16:59,817
Can we focus
on my shit-storm here?

339
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:01,686
Yeah. Sorry.

340
00:17:01,719 --> 00:17:05,090
I'm 42 years old.

341
00:17:05,123 --> 00:17:07,225
I'm sitting in a tree.

342
00:17:08,693 --> 00:17:10,328
You seem so sober now.

343
00:17:10,361 --> 00:17:13,531
What happened to
"touch my face"?

344
00:17:14,865 --> 00:17:18,203
I'm pretty sure it was
just dyed aspirin.

345
00:17:18,236 --> 00:17:20,638
Placebo, man.

346
00:17:20,671 --> 00:17:23,274
I'll tell you one thing...

347
00:17:23,308 --> 00:17:27,145
That shit-stack
just flunked Anthro 101.

348
00:17:27,178 --> 00:17:29,147
Guarantee it.

349
00:17:44,629 --> 00:17:46,731
WOMAN: Mr. Thurber,
may I have a word?

350
00:17:46,764 --> 00:17:48,566
Professor Slocumb,
how are you?

351
00:17:48,599 --> 00:17:51,402
Myself and the rest of
the female faculty

352
00:17:51,436 --> 00:17:53,104
Would very much
appreciate it

353
00:17:53,138 --> 00:17:55,606
If you would please
lift the toilet seat

354
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:58,709
When you urinate in
the faculty restroom.

355
00:17:58,743 --> 00:18:00,378
What are you
talking about?

356
00:18:00,411 --> 00:18:01,679
I always do.

357
00:18:01,712 --> 00:18:03,348
So, are you telling me

358
00:18:03,381 --> 00:18:06,117
That the puddle of urine
I just sat in

359
00:18:06,151 --> 00:18:07,652
Was not yours?

360
00:18:07,685 --> 00:18:09,654
Yeah. I mean, no.
It, uh...

361
00:18:09,687 --> 00:18:12,190
It wasn't mine.
It wasn't my urine.

362
00:18:12,223 --> 00:18:14,225
I watched you
leave the bathroom.

363
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:16,327
I swear,
I put the seat up.

364
00:18:16,361 --> 00:18:18,129
Maybe...

365
00:18:18,163 --> 00:18:19,630
Maybe when
I flushed it,

366
00:18:19,664 --> 00:18:21,266
You know, maybe
it sprayed up.

367
00:18:21,299 --> 00:18:24,135
No, no.
It was urine.

368
00:18:24,169 --> 00:18:26,237
And it looked to me
like you aimed directly

369
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:27,705
At the toilet seat...

370
00:18:27,738 --> 00:18:30,808
And just pissed...
Willy-nilly...

371
00:18:30,841 --> 00:18:32,177
Without a care
in the world.

372
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:36,214
I don't piss
willy-nilly, all right?

373
00:18:36,247 --> 00:18:38,149
I'm fairly accurate,

374
00:18:38,183 --> 00:18:39,550
And I always
put the seat up.

375
00:18:39,584 --> 00:18:41,852
Don't let it happen
again, Thurber.

376
00:18:43,854 --> 00:18:45,690
Hey. I didn't do it.

377
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:51,796
Way to go, fire hose.

378
00:19:00,571 --> 00:19:04,242
A pledge of $50 is
all we're asking for.

379
00:19:04,275 --> 00:19:06,244
Show us your support

380
00:19:06,277 --> 00:19:08,879

Hello?

Uh, hi.

387
00:19:27,998 --> 00:19:30,235
Hi. Are you interested
in contributing

388
00:19:30,268 --> 00:19:31,469
To public television?

389
00:19:31,502 --> 00:19:33,704
Not really, no.

390
00:19:33,738 --> 00:19:36,541
Well, sir, this is
a pledge drive.

391
00:19:36,574 --> 00:19:38,309
What are you wearing?

392
00:19:40,378 --> 00:19:42,480
I'm sorry, sir.
Please don't call again

393
00:19:42,513 --> 00:19:44,949
Unless you want
to contribute
to public television.

394
00:19:44,982 --> 00:19:48,219
I'm sorry.
It's just, uh...

00:19:48,253 --> 00:19:50,355
My father, uh...

396
00:19:50,388 --> 00:19:52,657
He's been calling

to people,

399
00:19:56,026 --> 00:19:58,696
And I, uh...

400
00:19:58,729 --> 00:20:01,599
Just wanted to see
what that was like.

401
00:20:01,632 --> 00:20:03,701
That's really weird.

402
00:20:03,734 --> 00:20:04,869
Yeah.

403
00:20:07,472 --> 00:20:08,873

Oh, thank you.

408
00:20:39,437 --> 00:20:41,539

put your coat in there.

the bathroom tonight,

to lift the seat?

I want to share with you all
a little secret

427
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,862
That Professor Slocumb
and I have been keeping
from you.

428
00:21:37,895 --> 00:21:39,564
We have decided

429
00:21:39,597 --> 00:21:42,099
To hire another tenure track
assistant professor

430
00:21:42,132 --> 00:21:44,402
In the English Department.

431
00:21:44,435 --> 00:21:45,870
Her name is Elaine Grasso.

432
00:21:45,903 --> 00:21:47,972
She comes to us directly
from Yale University,

433
00:21:48,005 --> 00:21:50,808
Where she received her Ph.D.
in English Literature,

434
00:21:50,841 --> 00:21:52,977
And has been teaching
for three years.

436
00:21:54,545 --> 00:21:57,348

very lucky to get her.

00:21:57,382 --> 00:22:01,786
I hope you will all
welcome her with open arms...

438
00:22:01,819 --> 00:22:03,421
And open minds.

some more thought

458

To what we talked about,
and, uh...

459
00:22:45,996 --> 00:22:48,132
I'd love to new
faculty adviser

460

you want, man.

had you pegged for it,

are we talking here?

we've started up.

Very creative, Stan.

513
00:24:53,257 --> 00:24:55,526

knew each other already.

00:25:58,055 --> 00:26:00,958
[Woman talking]

543
00:26:00,991 --> 00:26:03,961
JAY: Dude...
that's your sister?

544
00:26:07,632 --> 00:26:08,999
Come on, time's up.

545
00:26:09,033 --> 00:26:10,835
We're not playing
timed turns.

546
00:26:10,868 --> 00:26:12,970
DAD: The hell we're not.
Put 'em down.

547
00:26:14,271 --> 00:26:15,372
"Chug"?

548
00:26:15,405 --> 00:26:17,307
[Laughs]

549
00:26:17,341 --> 00:26:18,876
[Laughs]

550
00:26:18,909 --> 00:26:20,711
For Christ's sake, Charlie,
you're an English professor.

551
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:23,681
That's a word.
Maybe if I'd had
more time...

552
00:26:23,714 --> 00:26:25,082
"Chug" won't
get you tenure.

553
00:26:25,115 --> 00:26:28,152
I'll bet
that new girl...

554
00:26:28,185 --> 00:26:29,787
The Yaley...

555
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:31,288
Grasso.
Professor Grasso.

556
00:26:31,321 --> 00:26:33,057
Right. Grasso.

557
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:37,194
I'll bet you she knows
some two-syllable words.

558
00:26:37,227 --> 00:26:39,630
"Quixotic"?

559
00:26:39,664 --> 00:26:41,231
Dude, that's,
like, 1,000 points.

560
00:26:41,265 --> 00:26:42,967
Damn right,
Sasquatch.

561
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,769
And they say
I have Alzheimer's.

562
00:27:03,453 --> 00:27:04,855
Where's he going?

563
00:27:04,889 --> 00:27:06,891
Who the fuck knows?

564
00:27:08,225 --> 00:27:10,194
He's pretty cute.
Jay?!

565
00:27:10,227 --> 00:27:11,729
Yeah, man?

566
00:27:11,762 --> 00:27:14,398
No. Sorry.

567
00:27:14,431 --> 00:27:16,133
I wasn't
talking to you.

568
00:27:16,166 --> 00:27:17,401
It's okay.

569
00:27:17,434 --> 00:27:19,236
That's cool.

570
00:27:26,376 --> 00:27:28,779
Ah!

571
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:30,314
[Laughs]

572
00:27:34,318 --> 00:27:35,886
We need to talk.

573
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,688
About what?

574
00:27:37,722 --> 00:27:39,790
What do you think?
About Dad.

575
00:27:41,258 --> 00:27:42,693
More specifically...

576
00:27:42,727 --> 00:27:44,829
About how much money
his care is costing me.

577
00:27:44,862 --> 00:27:46,764
Oh, God.

578
00:27:46,797 --> 00:27:48,933
It's not right.
You're not even
visiting him regularly.

579
00:27:48,966 --> 00:27:50,735
I visit him. I've
missed once or twice.

580
00:27:50,768 --> 00:27:51,435
It's no biggie.

581
00:27:51,468 --> 00:27:53,738
Yes, it is.
It is a biggie.

582
00:27:53,771 --> 00:27:56,073
He needs to be able to
count on us. He's sick.

583
00:27:56,106 --> 00:27:58,809
He's fine! He just
won at Scrabble.

584
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:01,111
Okay, well,
I need a budget.

585
00:28:01,145 --> 00:28:03,480
And it wouldn't kill you
to spend $1,000 a month.

586
00:28:03,513 --> 00:28:05,983
And more, when you
get your tenure.

587
00:28:07,284 --> 00:28:09,453
JAY [shouts]: Somebody get
my video camera!

588
00:28:09,486 --> 00:28:10,988
Huh?

589
00:28:14,491 --> 00:28:16,326
[Phone ringing]

590
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,895
BETH: Hello?

591
00:28:17,928 --> 00:28:20,330
Beth?
Yeah? Who's this?

592
00:28:20,364 --> 00:28:22,366
Hi, it's Charlie,
from the telethon.

593
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:24,735
You gave me your
number, remember?

594
00:28:24,769 --> 00:28:27,471
Um... why are you
calling?

595
00:28:27,504 --> 00:28:30,908
Well, you said
that I could call
after pledge week.

596
00:28:30,941 --> 00:28:33,043
I just wanted
to talk.

597
00:28:33,077 --> 00:28:35,813
It's 2am, Charlie.

598
00:28:35,846 --> 00:28:38,315
I'm sorry. I just...
I thought...

599
00:28:38,348 --> 00:28:40,818
This is really weird.

600
00:28:40,851 --> 00:28:42,787
Please don't call me
anymore.

601
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:44,955
Okay. Um...

602
00:28:44,989 --> 00:28:46,924
I am sorry.

603
00:28:46,957 --> 00:28:48,826
[Sighs] Whatever.
Good night.

604
00:28:48,859 --> 00:28:50,861
[Beth hangs up]

605
00:29:05,242 --> 00:29:07,211
[Shouting indistinctly]

606
00:29:07,244 --> 00:29:09,880
Yeah! All right!

607
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:11,949
At least Steve Kim was...

608
00:29:11,982 --> 00:29:14,151
A pretty run-of-the-mill
Korean guy.

609
00:29:14,184 --> 00:29:15,820
I mean, he's a sharp
dresser and all...

610
00:29:15,853 --> 00:29:17,888
I don't think
she's that hot.

611
00:29:18,989 --> 00:29:20,891
Well, that's good, man.

612
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:23,760
Because as of today,
she's your mortal enemy.

613
00:29:26,263 --> 00:29:28,899
CHARLIE: She's not my
mortal enemy, buddy.

614
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:29,934
Not me.

615
00:29:29,967 --> 00:29:32,870
She's your Steve Kim.
Only hot.

616
00:29:32,903 --> 00:29:35,005
I'm doing everything
I can do, right?

617
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:37,441
I've started this new
poetry club with Stan.

618
00:29:37,474 --> 00:29:40,144
I'm pretty sure
my article's gonna be
published this semester.

619
00:29:40,177 --> 00:29:42,813
I've taught damn near
every class you can teach

620
00:29:42,847 --> 00:29:44,081
In the department.

621
00:29:45,549 --> 00:29:48,118
I think I'm in pretty
good shape. Aren't I?

622
00:29:48,152 --> 00:29:49,820
Do you pee sitting down?

623
00:29:49,854 --> 00:29:51,889
Yeah, occasionally,
at night. Why?

624
00:29:51,922 --> 00:29:53,523
Don't admit that.

625
00:29:53,557 --> 00:29:55,292
Look, I played
by the rules,

626
00:29:55,325 --> 00:29:57,561
And you saw what
happened to me.

627
00:29:57,594 --> 00:30:00,430
It's time
for politics, man.

628
00:30:00,464 --> 00:30:02,566
The dirtier, the better.

629
00:30:02,599 --> 00:30:05,535
Why can't I just teach
my damn classes?

630
00:30:05,569 --> 00:30:08,305
That's not how it works.
You gotta get creative.

631
00:30:08,338 --> 00:30:09,940
I mean, look at her.
She's not even sitting

632
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:11,441
On the right side
of the bleachers.

633
00:30:11,475 --> 00:30:12,843
CHARLIE: Yeah.

634
00:30:12,877 --> 00:30:14,578
Catch my drift?
No.

635
00:30:14,611 --> 00:30:16,881
Wrong side
of the bleachers.

636
00:30:18,883 --> 00:30:20,985
Oh, yeah. Like, uh...

637
00:30:22,219 --> 00:30:24,421
Poor school spirit?
Exactly.

638
00:30:24,454 --> 00:30:27,091
School spirit
is a solid angle, man.

639
00:30:27,124 --> 00:30:29,259
You deserve tenure.

640
00:30:29,293 --> 00:30:31,461
That's your spot,
not hers.

641
00:30:32,629 --> 00:30:34,431
School spirit.

642
00:30:39,669 --> 00:30:41,972
[Laughing]

643
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:54,384
Good Lord.

644
00:30:54,418 --> 00:30:56,887
Charlie, what are
you wearing?

645
00:30:56,921 --> 00:30:59,957
Oh. Yeah. Hi.

646
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:01,125
Oh, I see.

647
00:31:01,158 --> 00:31:02,893
Elaine was
just telling me

648
00:31:02,927 --> 00:31:04,895
She is going
to be published

649
00:31:04,929 --> 00:31:06,897
In the next issue
of the August Journal.

650
00:31:06,931 --> 00:31:08,165
Isn't that fantastic?

651
00:31:09,399 --> 00:31:11,601
That's really great.
It's wonderful.

652
00:31:11,635 --> 00:31:13,403
No, it's not
such a big deal.

653
00:31:13,437 --> 00:31:16,606
On the contrary, Elaine,
it is a big deal.

654
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,675
The August Journal
is the cream of the crop.

655
00:31:18,708 --> 00:31:21,678
Yes. Congratulations.
Good job.

656
00:31:21,711 --> 00:31:24,648
Oh, say, Elaine, I was
gonna mention to you

657
00:31:24,681 --> 00:31:26,951
That, uh... I couldn't
help but notice,

658
00:31:26,984 --> 00:31:29,419
At the basketball game
yesterday,

659
00:31:29,453 --> 00:31:32,990
You were sitting on
the opposing team's
side of the court.

660
00:31:33,023 --> 00:31:35,059
Oh.

661
00:31:35,092 --> 00:31:36,526
I didn't even know.

662
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:38,662
I just wanted
to watch the game.

663
00:31:38,695 --> 00:31:40,697
No biggie.

664
00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:43,200
I don't know how they
do things over at Yale,

665
00:31:43,233 --> 00:31:44,701
But around here,

666
00:31:44,734 --> 00:31:47,371
We're pretty big
on school spirit.

667
00:31:49,706 --> 00:31:52,342
Okay. Go Whales!
Right? Ha ha!

668
00:32:00,717 --> 00:32:02,987
What I'm saying, Ben,

669
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:05,122
I just don't think
your story's as smart
as you are.

670
00:32:05,155 --> 00:32:06,356
I don't think
there is enough

671
00:32:06,390 --> 00:32:07,691
Of who you are
as a person in it.

672
00:32:07,724 --> 00:32:10,127
So, you're saying
it sucks, right?

673
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,396
No, that's not what
I'm saying at all.

674
00:32:12,429 --> 00:32:14,064
I just think
it could be great

675
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:16,266
If there was more,
you know, Ben in it.

676
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:19,036
You've written a story here
that's about a hockey player.

677
00:32:19,069 --> 00:32:20,137
That's not you.

678
00:32:20,170 --> 00:32:21,538
Well, what would
you write about?

679
00:32:21,571 --> 00:32:23,473
Uh...

680
00:32:23,507 --> 00:32:25,742
I'd write a story
about a, uh...

681
00:32:25,775 --> 00:32:28,445
A teacher whose life
is in a shambles,

682
00:32:28,478 --> 00:32:31,748
Just a kind of
slow-moving disaster.

683
00:32:31,781 --> 00:32:33,517
He's mid-thirties,

684
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:35,352
Still sleeping on a futon.

685
00:32:35,385 --> 00:32:37,121
[Chuckling]

686
00:32:37,154 --> 00:32:38,755
The point is,
it'd be terrible.

687
00:32:38,788 --> 00:32:41,425
But I'm not a good writer.
You are. You all are.

688
00:32:41,458 --> 00:32:44,094
That's what I'm trying
to tell you guys.

689
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:45,996
Maybe the teacher
in your story

690
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:48,198
Just needs somebody
to help him...

691
00:32:48,232 --> 00:32:50,567
You know,
to organize himself.

692
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:53,237
Yeah. Yeah, thanks.

693
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:56,006
Look, you all want
to be writers.

694
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,741
You're really gonna have to
try and look inside yourselves

695
00:32:57,774 --> 00:32:59,343
And examine who you are.

696
00:32:59,376 --> 00:33:02,579
Otherwise,
it's a waste of time.

697
00:33:02,612 --> 00:33:04,781
You know,
take Stan, for instance.

698
00:33:04,814 --> 00:33:07,384
He's been working on,
uh...

699
00:33:07,417 --> 00:33:09,053
Well, sex poems.

700
00:33:09,086 --> 00:33:11,021
[Laughter]

701
00:33:11,055 --> 00:33:13,523
Look, it's not a joke.
It takes courage to do that.

702
00:33:13,557 --> 00:33:15,492
That's what I'm trying
to say to you guys.

703
00:33:15,525 --> 00:33:18,095
You're gonna have
to take a chance
to do something good.

704
00:33:18,128 --> 00:33:20,330
But what if writing
what you really want
would get you in trouble?

705
00:33:20,364 --> 00:33:23,133
Guys, look...

706
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:25,602
I told you...
For this class,

707
00:33:25,635 --> 00:33:27,337
I don't want there
to be any rules.

708
00:33:27,371 --> 00:33:29,106
I don't care what
the other teachers tell you.

709
00:33:29,139 --> 00:33:32,309
I just want you
to be yourselves. Okay?

710
00:33:32,342 --> 00:33:34,144
Write about what you know.

711
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:36,780
Okay.

712
00:33:36,813 --> 00:33:40,084
Don't... Don't worry.
It's not a test.

713
00:33:40,117 --> 00:33:41,818
Teacher evaluation form.

714
00:33:41,851 --> 00:33:43,453
Just take a look at it.

715
00:33:43,487 --> 00:33:45,189
Fill it out for me, please.

716
00:33:45,222 --> 00:33:46,623
STAN: What's it for?

717
00:33:46,656 --> 00:33:48,158
It's standard

719
00:33:49,359 --> 00:33:52,196

No, not yet.

725
00:34:12,816 --> 00:34:14,818
Is this gonna be
a problem?

726
00:34:14,851 --> 00:34:17,154
No. I, uh...

it again, and...

for tenure.

into something really good.

Yeah, all the time.
You know, since the trip.

the best advice
I got about teaching

Was just to try to not
act like a teacher.

892
00:42:18,602 --> 00:42:20,336

be the problem.

I've been lookin'
all over for you.

897
00:42:26,843 --> 00:42:28,878
We've got
the Bigfoot Club.

898
00:42:28,912 --> 00:42:30,213
The kids are waiting.

899
00:42:30,246 --> 00:42:33,216
You know, we can
do this another time.

900
00:42:33,249 --> 00:42:34,317
I'm sorry.

901
00:42:34,350 --> 00:42:35,852
No, that's fine.

902
00:42:35,885 --> 00:42:37,553
We're searching
for Sasquatch.

903
00:42:38,988 --> 00:42:40,323
Oh. Great.

904
00:42:40,356 --> 00:42:42,726
Well, good luck.

905
00:42:42,759 --> 00:42:44,160
Yeah.

906
00:42:46,262 --> 00:42:48,632
Dude, I told you to page me
if you were under attack.

907
00:42:48,665 --> 00:42:50,233
I wasn't under attack.

908
00:42:50,266 --> 00:42:51,901
I was trying to converse
with a colleague.

909
00:42:51,935 --> 00:42:53,369
I was just trying
to talk to Elaine.

910
00:42:53,402 --> 00:42:55,338
Don't let Elaine
sweet-talk you.

911
00:42:55,371 --> 00:42:57,874
It's time to be strong...

912
00:42:57,907 --> 00:42:59,776
Or it's all over.

913
00:42:59,809 --> 00:43:02,178
Pack your bags
for Turdville State.

914
00:43:02,211 --> 00:43:04,180
Come on.
Where are we going?

915
00:43:04,213 --> 00:43:05,882
I told you...
Bigfoot Club.

916
00:43:05,915 --> 00:43:08,117
That was for real?

917
00:43:08,151 --> 00:43:10,620
Well, I'm not a member,
am I? So I...

918
00:43:10,654 --> 00:43:13,156
Probationary.
But the guys dig you.

919
00:43:13,189 --> 00:43:15,324
Plus, you got a car.

920
00:43:15,358 --> 00:43:16,826
Come on.

921
00:43:19,028 --> 00:43:20,764
[Sighs]

922
00:43:23,867 --> 00:43:25,401
Leakey's gonna be pissed

923
00:43:25,434 --> 00:43:27,804
When I'm on the cover of
National Geographic.

924
00:43:27,837 --> 00:43:29,305
Oh, yeah.

925
00:43:29,338 --> 00:43:30,974
You'll be
an American hero,

926
00:43:31,007 --> 00:43:33,342
And he'll still be riding
his stupid fold-up bike

927
00:43:33,376 --> 00:43:35,712
Around Grey College.

928
00:43:35,745 --> 00:43:38,214
Does that thing
fold up?

929
00:43:38,247 --> 00:43:40,383
That's actually
kind of sweet.

930
00:43:40,416 --> 00:43:42,118
I don't know. Maybe.

931
00:43:42,151 --> 00:43:43,386
BOY [shouts]: Dr. Hadley!

932
00:43:43,419 --> 00:43:45,354
Get the calipers!

933
00:43:47,423 --> 00:43:49,025
Calipers.

934
00:43:50,326 --> 00:43:52,996
Remember...
If we make contact,

935
00:43:53,029 --> 00:43:55,631
Don't show your teeth.
Never bare your teeth!

936
00:43:58,301 --> 00:43:59,669
Come on!

937
00:43:59,703 --> 00:44:01,237
This is what
you signed up for!

938
00:44:10,146 --> 00:44:12,248
Remind me
to email that photo

939
00:44:12,281 --> 00:44:13,683
To Steve Kim,
will you?

940
00:44:13,717 --> 00:44:16,820
Okay. "Email
Professor Kim."

941
00:44:16,853 --> 00:44:18,421
CHARLIE: Do you think
it's real?

942
00:44:18,454 --> 00:44:21,157
You're fuckin'-A right
it's real.

943
00:44:21,190 --> 00:44:23,359
The only problem is...

944
00:44:23,392 --> 00:44:26,129
I forgot to bring
my plaster casting
gear with me.

945
00:44:26,162 --> 00:44:28,297
The West Coasters
are gonna call bullshit

946
00:44:28,331 --> 00:44:29,733
On the whole thing.

947
00:44:29,766 --> 00:44:31,267
Fucking snobs.

948
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:32,736
That's bullshit!

949
00:44:32,769 --> 00:44:34,137
Take it easy, guys.

950
00:44:34,170 --> 00:44:36,339
It's all part of
the yeti game.

951
00:44:36,372 --> 00:44:38,441
What about the photos?
Those work, right?

952
00:44:38,474 --> 00:44:41,277
Anybody can pull a hoax
with Photoshop these days.

953
00:44:41,310 --> 00:44:43,713
This is bull-crap.

954
00:44:43,747 --> 00:44:46,115
This is solid
progress, guys.

955
00:44:46,149 --> 00:44:47,751
Don't let it
get you down.

956
00:44:47,784 --> 00:44:49,819
Go back to campus,
get my plaster gear...

957
00:44:49,853 --> 00:44:51,454
What if it rains?
We'll lose the print!

958
00:44:51,487 --> 00:44:53,156
Cool down, dudes!

959
00:44:53,189 --> 00:44:55,191
Easy. It's okay.

960
00:44:55,224 --> 00:44:58,027
One thing's for sure...

961
00:44:58,061 --> 00:45:01,397
That son of a bitch
is out there somewhere.

962
00:45:07,303 --> 00:45:10,807
[Thunder]

963
00:45:18,848 --> 00:45:20,784
[Beep]

964
00:45:20,817 --> 00:45:22,986
MARGARET:
Did you ever talk to Dad
about the telethons?

965
00:45:23,019 --> 00:45:24,520
You didn't, did you?

966
00:45:24,553 --> 00:45:26,756
They called me again,
Charlie.

967
00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:28,291
[Beep]

968
00:45:28,324 --> 00:45:30,526
JAY:
Faculty lounge, noon.

969
00:45:30,559 --> 00:45:32,862
I've got a winner.

970
00:45:32,896 --> 00:45:34,130
[Beep]

971
00:45:42,171 --> 00:45:43,840
Hmm!

972
00:45:45,241 --> 00:45:46,542
That's funny.

973
00:45:46,575 --> 00:45:49,078
I thought I left a Coke
in here yesterday.

974
00:45:49,112 --> 00:45:51,180
Hmm. Oh, Elaine?

975
00:45:51,214 --> 00:45:53,249
Did you get that Coke
out of the refrigerator?

976
00:45:53,282 --> 00:45:55,184
No.

977
00:45:55,218 --> 00:45:57,320
I brought this one
from home. Why?

978
00:45:57,353 --> 00:46:00,156
No reason. I left a Coke
in the fridge yesterday,

979
00:46:00,189 --> 00:46:01,490
And now it's gone.

980
00:46:01,524 --> 00:46:03,559
Well,
this one's mine.

981
00:46:03,592 --> 00:46:05,394
I'm sure of it.

982
00:46:05,428 --> 00:46:08,197
Oh. Well, I always put
a little sticker on mine

983
00:46:08,231 --> 00:46:09,966
With my name on it.

984
00:46:09,999 --> 00:46:11,901
So, I guess
we could find out.

985
00:46:11,935 --> 00:46:13,803
Do you mind?

986
00:46:16,105 --> 00:46:17,540
Heh.

987
00:46:19,075 --> 00:46:20,243
Satisfied?

988
00:46:20,276 --> 00:46:21,811
I would be...

989
00:46:21,845 --> 00:46:24,347
Except I put the sticker
on the bottom of the can.

990
00:46:33,156 --> 00:46:34,590
That can't...
That can't be.

991
00:46:34,623 --> 00:46:36,392
I brought this one
from home.

992
00:46:36,425 --> 00:46:37,994
JAY: I'm not gonna make
a big deal out of it.

993
00:46:38,027 --> 00:46:39,562
ELAINE: It's warm.
It's not from
the refrigerator.

994
00:46:39,595 --> 00:46:41,230
JAY: Do me a favor.

995
00:46:41,264 --> 00:46:43,867
Just buy your own Coke
from now on.

996
00:47:01,918 --> 00:47:05,288
STAN: "My fuck machine's
engines are roaring",

997
00:47:05,321 --> 00:47:07,857
"They're soaring!

998
00:47:07,891 --> 00:47:11,627
Stroking and stroking
my balls..."

999
00:47:11,660 --> 00:47:12,962
[Door opens]

1000
00:47:12,996 --> 00:47:16,599
Is this
the Erotic Poetry Club?

1001
00:47:16,632 --> 00:47:18,601
Uh, yeah. Hi, Robin.

1002
00:47:18,634 --> 00:47:21,270
It is, but we're actually
just wrapping things up.

1003
00:47:21,304 --> 00:47:22,405
Weren't we, Stan?

1004
00:47:22,438 --> 00:47:23,973
No. We just started.

1005
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:25,608
You should join.

1006
00:47:25,641 --> 00:47:28,277
I don't think we're actually
taking new members
this semester. Sorry.

1007
00:47:28,311 --> 00:47:30,246
Yes, we are.
Yes, we are.

1008
00:47:30,279 --> 00:47:32,181
ROBIN: Um, so...

1009
00:47:32,215 --> 00:47:34,951
What are you guys...
do here?

1010
00:47:34,984 --> 00:47:36,652
Well, um...

1011
00:47:36,685 --> 00:47:39,655
Stan kind of teaches me
the ways of the world,

1012
00:47:39,688 --> 00:47:41,657
And I try
and soak it all in.

1013
00:47:41,690 --> 00:47:43,993
That's not true.
It is, Stan.

1014
00:47:44,027 --> 00:47:46,662
Don't sell yourself short.
Remember what I told you?

1015
00:47:46,695 --> 00:47:49,032
ROBIN:
I wrote a poem.

1016
00:47:49,065 --> 00:47:51,500
It's called
Teacher's Pet.

1017
00:47:51,534 --> 00:47:53,036
Read it. Read it.

1018
00:47:53,069 --> 00:47:54,403
Whoa. Robin,
do me a favor...

1019
00:47:54,437 --> 00:47:56,005
Wait on that, okay?

1020
00:47:56,039 --> 00:47:57,673
Stan, do you have something
you could read first?

1021
00:47:57,706 --> 00:47:59,675
No.

1022
00:47:59,708 --> 00:48:01,244
It's just that there's
kind of a hierarchy

1023
00:48:01,277 --> 00:48:02,545
In the Erotic Poetry Club.

1024
00:48:02,578 --> 00:48:04,147
And generally, as a rule,

1025
00:48:04,180 --> 00:48:06,549
We don't allow our
newer members to read

1026
00:48:06,582 --> 00:48:07,984
On their first day.

1027
00:48:08,017 --> 00:48:10,019
There's never been
a new member.

1028
00:48:10,053 --> 00:48:11,520
And I'm president,

1029
00:48:11,554 --> 00:48:13,656
So I can overrule you.
Read it.

1030
00:48:13,689 --> 00:48:15,925
ROBIN: Okay.

1031
00:48:20,663 --> 00:48:22,966
"I want to be
the teacher's pet."

1032
00:48:25,201 --> 00:48:27,536
"The thought of it
makes me..."

1033
00:48:27,570 --> 00:48:29,072
Okay!
I gotta get going.

1034
00:48:29,105 --> 00:48:30,673
You guys take it
from here.

1035
00:48:30,706 --> 00:48:32,341
No! Let her finish.

1036
00:48:32,375 --> 00:48:33,909
Sit down. Sit down.

1037
00:48:36,679 --> 00:48:39,983
ROBIN: "I want to be
the teacher's pet."

1038
00:48:40,016 --> 00:48:43,319
"The thought of it
makes me..."

1039
00:48:43,352 --> 00:48:45,521
"Sad."

1040
00:48:45,554 --> 00:48:49,625
"Because I know
it's not to be."

1041
00:48:49,658 --> 00:48:51,694
"I'm not for him..."

1042
00:48:51,727 --> 00:48:54,163
"And he's not for me."

1043
00:48:56,699 --> 00:48:59,602
That wasn't very erotic.

1044
00:48:59,635 --> 00:49:01,937
Was it?

1045
00:49:20,723 --> 00:49:21,724
Hey.

1046
00:49:21,757 --> 00:49:23,359
Hi.

1047
00:49:25,761 --> 00:49:27,463
Don't worry, okay?

1048
00:49:27,496 --> 00:49:29,032
It gets better.

1049
00:49:30,333 --> 00:49:32,235
I'm not so sure.

1050
00:49:34,070 --> 00:49:36,105
You want to take a walk
or something?

1051
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:38,407
Yeah.

1052
00:49:38,441 --> 00:49:39,742
Yeah, I'd like that.

1053
00:49:39,775 --> 00:49:41,344
Okay.

1054
00:49:46,082 --> 00:49:47,450
I'm a terrible
teacher.

1055
00:49:47,483 --> 00:49:50,219
Oh, come on.
No.

1056
00:49:50,253 --> 00:49:52,455
You're just having
a tough time adjusting.

1057
00:49:52,488 --> 00:49:54,257
It gets easier.

1058
00:49:54,290 --> 00:49:56,059
No, no.

1059
00:49:56,092 --> 00:49:58,361
I was at Yale
for three years.

1060
00:49:58,394 --> 00:50:01,597
Same thing...
I never adjusted.

1061
00:50:01,630 --> 00:50:04,200
Well, they can
smell fear, the kids.

1062
00:50:04,233 --> 00:50:05,634
I know.

1063
00:50:05,668 --> 00:50:07,036
Yeah.

1064
00:50:09,805 --> 00:50:12,108
Can I tell you
a secret?

1065
00:50:12,141 --> 00:50:13,209
Sure.

1066
00:50:15,078 --> 00:50:17,513
Yale was going
to fire me.

1067
00:50:17,546 --> 00:50:19,448
Really?

1068
00:50:19,482 --> 00:50:21,784
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

1069
00:50:21,817 --> 00:50:23,719
That's why I'm here.

1070
00:50:23,752 --> 00:50:27,090
I know Dean Leakey
paints a rosier picture,

1071
00:50:27,123 --> 00:50:29,192
But that's the truth.

1072
00:50:29,225 --> 00:50:32,161
I just couldn't cut it.

1073
00:50:32,195 --> 00:50:34,363
I just freeze up,
you know?

1074
00:50:34,397 --> 00:50:36,265
I prepare, I plan,

1075
00:50:36,299 --> 00:50:38,367
I write everything down.
I know...

1076
00:50:38,401 --> 00:50:41,137
I know all the material
backwards and forwards.

1077
00:50:41,170 --> 00:50:42,605
But it just never fails.

1078
00:50:42,638 --> 00:50:44,840
Every time I get
in front of the class,

1079
00:50:44,873 --> 00:50:46,809
I freeze up.

1080
00:50:49,212 --> 00:50:51,080
I don't know
what to do.

1081
00:50:55,184 --> 00:50:57,486
Well, I mean,
maybe you should try

1082
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:59,155
To not prepare
so much.

1083
00:50:59,188 --> 00:51:00,289
Don't write
everything down.

1084
00:51:00,323 --> 00:51:02,525
Don't plan so much.

1085
00:51:02,558 --> 00:51:04,727
Just try to wing it
and see what happens.
Ha ha!

1086
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:07,096
No, I think
you'd be surprised
by how well you do.

1087
00:51:07,130 --> 00:51:09,432
That's completely
terrifying.

1088
00:51:09,465 --> 00:51:11,234
The fear part
goes away

1089
00:51:11,267 --> 00:51:13,202
Once you get
the hang of it.

1090
00:51:14,903 --> 00:51:16,672
I don't know.

1091
00:51:18,707 --> 00:51:21,810
Well, just remember...

1092
00:51:21,844 --> 00:51:24,447
You're the smartest
person in the room.

1093
00:51:26,249 --> 00:51:28,217
Hell, you're probably
the smartest person

1094
00:51:28,251 --> 00:51:30,253
At Grey College.

1095
00:51:34,290 --> 00:51:35,724
Hmm.

1096
00:51:35,758 --> 00:51:37,593
Hmm.

1097
00:51:37,626 --> 00:51:40,363
JAY: Did you see the look
on Leakey's face?

1098
00:51:40,396 --> 00:51:42,198
You're not hearing me.

1099
00:51:42,231 --> 00:51:43,799
It's over.

1100
00:51:46,602 --> 00:51:49,505
You're my best
friend, Charlie.

1101
00:51:49,538 --> 00:51:51,207
I'm just trying
to help.

1102
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:54,177
I know you are, Jay,
but it's not right,

1103
00:51:54,210 --> 00:51:55,611
What you're doing.

1104
00:51:55,644 --> 00:51:58,181
And it's
stressing me out.

1105
00:51:58,214 --> 00:52:00,749
And, you know,
she's a nice person.

1106
00:52:02,251 --> 00:52:03,586
How nice?

1107
00:52:03,619 --> 00:52:05,154
Nice.

1108
00:52:05,188 --> 00:52:06,755
Pleasant.

1109
00:52:06,789 --> 00:52:09,225
Christ, you dig her,
don't you?

1110
00:52:09,258 --> 00:52:10,893
No, I don't dig her, Jay.

1111
00:52:10,926 --> 00:52:13,362
I just... I said
she was pleasant.

1112
00:52:17,933 --> 00:52:19,868
Still want to go to
the seminar with me?

1113
00:52:19,902 --> 00:52:21,637
Or are you all
mad at me?

1114
00:52:21,670 --> 00:52:23,939
I'll go. Just stop
accusing people

1115
00:52:23,972 --> 00:52:27,443
Of stealing Cokes,
all right?

right, my man.

everyone in this room.

You!

1127
00:52:53,702 --> 00:52:56,205

What's your name?

1128
00:52:56,239 --> 00:52:57,340
Charlie.

1129
00:52:57,373 --> 00:53:00,209
Charlie! I'm Dave.

1130
00:53:00,243 --> 00:53:01,043
Hi.

1131
00:53:01,076 --> 00:53:02,611
That's the guy I was
telling you about.

1132
00:53:02,645 --> 00:53:04,713
Tell me something,
Charlie...

1133
00:53:04,747 --> 00:53:06,415
Are you satisfied

1134
00:53:06,449 --> 00:53:08,484
With the way things
are going in your life?

1135
00:53:08,517 --> 00:53:10,919
Yeah,
it's pretty good.

1136
00:53:10,953 --> 00:53:13,322
Zowie! Then why
are you here, Charlie?

1137
00:53:13,356 --> 00:53:14,657
Actually...

1138
00:53:14,690 --> 00:53:16,959
If my life were
pretty good,

1139
00:53:16,992 --> 00:53:19,662
I sure as hell wouldn't
be here right now,
you know what I'm sayin'?

1140
00:53:19,695 --> 00:53:21,630
So...

1141
00:53:21,664 --> 00:53:24,300
"Pretty good".

1142
00:53:24,333 --> 00:53:26,469
"Pretty good."

1143
00:53:26,502 --> 00:53:28,537
You're satisfied
with "pretty good"?

1144
00:53:28,571 --> 00:53:30,806
Yeah, I think so.

1145
00:53:33,542 --> 00:53:35,444
Let me tell you something,

1146
00:53:35,478 --> 00:53:38,247
Right here, right now,
Charlie.

1147
00:53:38,281 --> 00:53:40,383
No, you're not.

1148
00:53:41,817 --> 00:53:44,687
Now I'm gonna ask
that question again.

1149
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:46,655
Are you satisfied?

1150
00:53:46,689 --> 00:53:47,956
Yes.

1151
00:53:47,990 --> 00:53:52,361
And the answer is:
no... you're... not.

1152
00:53:52,395 --> 00:53:53,362
I am, actually.
I'm...

1153
00:53:53,396 --> 00:53:55,998
No, you're not, Charlie.
Everybody, come on.

1154
00:53:56,031 --> 00:53:57,533
Say it with me.

1155
00:53:57,566 --> 00:53:59,635
No, you're not.

1156
00:53:59,668 --> 00:54:01,804
ALL: No, you're not.
Yeah!

1157
00:54:01,837 --> 00:54:03,872
No, you're not!

1158
00:54:03,906 --> 00:54:05,007
I'm happy...

1159
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:06,575
You're not, Charlie.
Okay, no, I'm not.

1160
00:54:06,609 --> 00:54:08,344
Or you wouldn't be here.

1161
00:54:08,377 --> 00:54:09,745
You follow me?

1162
00:54:09,778 --> 00:54:11,514
Yeah.

1163
00:54:11,547 --> 00:54:13,849
Herb-Erect is the future.

1164
00:54:15,050 --> 00:54:17,486
And believe you me...

1165
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:23,025
If you have ever had
a 100% organic erection,

1166
00:54:23,058 --> 00:54:25,761
You'll understand why
this stuff sells itself.

1167
00:54:25,794 --> 00:54:27,330
I gotta go.
Excuse me.

1168
00:54:27,363 --> 00:54:28,597
Charlie.

1169
00:54:42,945 --> 00:54:44,813
Wonderful news,
isn't it, Charlie?

1170
00:54:44,847 --> 00:54:46,081
Yeah.

1171
00:54:46,114 --> 00:54:48,351

1172
00:54:48,384 --> 00:54:51,086
How are your own
publishing pursuits going?

1173
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:54,523
It's been a dog's age
since your last article.

1174
00:54:54,557 --> 00:54:56,859
Things are looking
really good.

1175
00:54:58,394 --> 00:55:00,463
We'll be hearing
the good news soon, then.

1176

ELAINE: Charlie.

1177
00:55:10,373 --> 00:55:11,940
Oh. Hey, Elaine.

1178
00:55:11,974 --> 00:55:14,076
Congratulations
on your article.

1179
00:55:14,109 --> 00:55:15,911
Oh, thank you.

1180
00:55:15,944 --> 00:55:18,113
Listen, um...

1181
00:55:18,146 --> 00:55:19,982
My boyfriend is visiting
for the weekend,

1182
00:55:20,015 --> 00:55:21,650
And, well,
I was wondering

1183
00:55:21,684 --> 00:55:23,752
If you and your partner
might want to come
for dinner.

1184
00:55:23,786 --> 00:55:25,854
Sure, that sounds gr...

1185
00:55:25,888 --> 00:55:27,623
I'm sorry,
did you say "partner"?

1186
00:55:27,656 --> 00:55:29,692
Yeah. Well,
Professor Hadley told me

1187
00:55:29,725 --> 00:55:31,093
You had a partner.

1188
00:55:32,795 --> 00:55:35,431
Like a male partner?
Like a man?

1189
00:55:35,464 --> 00:55:37,433
Well, yeah.
That's what he said.

1190
00:55:37,466 --> 00:55:39,602
No. No, uh...

1191
00:55:39,635 --> 00:55:41,404
That's not true.

1192
00:55:41,437 --> 00:55:43,539
What exactly, uh...

1193
00:55:43,572 --> 00:55:45,641
Did Professor Hadley
say to you?

1194
00:55:45,674 --> 00:55:47,743
He told me you were gay.

1195
00:55:47,776 --> 00:55:49,512
No. No, I'm not.

1196
00:55:49,545 --> 00:55:51,847
I'm afraid he was
just pulling your leg.
I'm straight...

1197
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:54,583
Uh, as an arrow.
Oh, my God...

1198
00:55:54,617 --> 00:55:56,485
I've got a girlfriend
and everything.

1199
00:55:56,519 --> 00:55:59,488
I'm so... I'm sorry.
No, I'm so embarrassed.

1200
00:55:59,522 --> 00:56:00,556
Don't be.

1201
00:56:00,589 --> 00:56:02,157
I didn't... I thought
it was strange.

1202
00:56:02,190 --> 00:56:03,792
Um, well, listen,

1203
00:56:03,826 --> 00:56:05,828

girlfriend come?

It's her night off.

1207
00:56:10,499 --> 00:56:12,468
She works at PBS.

1208
00:56:12,501 --> 00:56:14,937
Great.
Yeah.

1209
00:56:14,970 --> 00:56:16,472
Well, I'll see you then.

1210
00:56:16,505 --> 00:56:18,006
We'll be there.

actually met in person,

not to call me again.

But, look...

1215
00:56:33,889 --> 00:56:36,058
I really need a date
to this party,

1216
00:56:36,091 --> 00:56:39,094
And who knows? You may
even like me, right?

1217
00:56:39,127 --> 00:56:40,696
I don't know.

1218
00:56:40,729 --> 00:56:43,966
All right, well, listen,
I'm not a stalker, okay?

1219
00:56:43,999 --> 00:56:46,001
So, we meet
in a public place,

1220
00:56:46,034 --> 00:56:48,036
So there are
no safety issues.

1221
00:56:48,070 --> 00:56:49,805
It's a long story,

1222
00:56:49,838 --> 00:56:51,940
But it would really
be helpful for me

1223
00:56:51,974 --> 00:56:54,610
If you could do this,
you know?

1224
00:56:54,643 --> 00:56:57,580
I'm sorry.
I just can't do it.

1225
00:57:00,215 --> 00:57:02,217
What if I pay you
a hundred bucks?

00:57:04,653 --> 00:57:06,455
Okay, fine.

1228
00:57:06,489 --> 00:57:07,856
Yeah, 250's good.

1229
00:57:07,890 --> 00:57:09,758

is going to drive us.

Indians call him
Sasquatch.

1249

They believe
he is as gentle

1250
00:57:50,766 --> 00:57:52,968
As he is powerful
and mysterious.

What I said was
that you were bi...

She obviously doesn't even
know how to take a joke.

of English Literature.

The food at Yale is
positively exquisite, Beth.

Beth, did you know
that Charlie

1409
01:04:32,500 --> 01:04:35,003
Is one of the most popular
teachers at Grey?

1410
01:04:35,037 --> 01:04:38,540

much, to be honest.

a good teacher,

In your professional
opinion?

1421
01:05:00,728 --> 01:05:02,697
Well, I think
the most important thing

1422
01:05:02,730 --> 01:05:05,333
Is to never forget what
it was like to be a student.

and picture myself

01:05:10,738 --> 01:05:11,974
[Laughs]

1427
01:05:15,077 --> 01:05:16,378
What?

1428
01:05:16,411 --> 01:05:18,380
Um, I mean...

1429
01:05:18,413 --> 01:05:20,548
Why the hell should they
care what I say?

1430
01:05:20,582 --> 01:05:22,550
I think you have
to find a way in,

1431
01:05:22,584 --> 01:05:24,686
And, you know, make them
laugh, challenge them,

1432
01:05:24,719 --> 01:05:27,222
Keep surprising them.

1433
01:05:27,255 --> 01:05:29,624
And, um, once you're in,

1434
01:05:29,657 --> 01:05:32,027
I think you'd better
find a way to stay in.

1435
01:05:32,060 --> 01:05:35,030
I guess that's...
what I think.

1436
01:05:35,063 --> 01:05:36,564
We have a slightly
different approach.

1437
01:05:36,598 --> 01:05:38,300
I've never really felt
that friendships

1438
01:05:38,333 --> 01:05:40,535
Between teacher
and student
are beneficial.

1439
01:05:40,568 --> 01:05:43,571
But obviously
we're all entitled

1440
01:05:43,605 --> 01:05:45,040
To our own, uh...

1441
01:05:45,073 --> 01:05:47,409
Shall we say, style.

1442
01:05:47,442 --> 01:05:51,379
Warren, you haven't taught
a class for three years.

1443
01:05:51,413 --> 01:05:54,216
Thank you for reminding me
of that. That's true.

1444
01:05:54,249 --> 01:05:56,551
So, are you on sabbatical?

1445
01:05:56,584 --> 01:05:58,120
Yes, that's right.

1446
01:05:58,153 --> 01:06:00,255
That must be so cool.

1447
01:06:00,288 --> 01:06:02,024
Do you get high a lot?

1448
01:06:04,559 --> 01:06:06,428
Hmm, no.

1449
01:06:06,461 --> 01:06:08,330
No, I... I don't.

01:06:13,301 --> 01:06:14,769
Heh.

1452
01:06:14,802 --> 01:06:17,072
Beth's...
really nice.

1453
01:06:17,105 --> 01:06:18,740
Yeah.

1454
01:06:18,773 --> 01:06:20,708
Where'd you meet her?

1455
01:06:20,742 --> 01:06:23,211
We met at a, uh...

1456
01:06:23,245 --> 01:06:26,048
PBS thing.

1457
01:06:26,081 --> 01:06:28,183
We were volunteers.

1458
01:06:28,216 --> 01:06:30,718
Oh. That's sweet.

1459
01:06:30,752 --> 01:06:33,021
And how long
have you been dating?

1460
01:06:33,055 --> 01:06:35,223
Not long. It's really
not serious.

1461
01:06:35,257 --> 01:06:37,492
Oh. Charlie.
That's awful.

1462
01:06:37,525 --> 01:06:39,661
No, it's the truth.

1463
01:06:39,694 --> 01:06:42,797
Well, she adores you.
Trust me.

1464
01:06:42,830 --> 01:06:46,268
Warren... Warren seems
pretty cool.

1465
01:06:46,301 --> 01:06:49,137
Yeah. Well,
he's unique.

1466
01:06:49,171 --> 01:06:51,439
Yeah.

1467
01:06:51,473 --> 01:06:53,275
You know what?
I really...

1468
01:06:53,308 --> 01:06:55,043
I liked what
you said in there

1469
01:06:55,077 --> 01:06:56,644
About teaching.

1470
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:01,583
Um, so, has it been
going any better?

1471
01:07:01,616 --> 01:07:03,218
Yeah. You know,
I still feel

1472
01:07:03,251 --> 01:07:05,520
A little bit like
an imposter, you know?

1473
01:07:05,553 --> 01:07:07,189
But I tried
what you told me.

1474
01:07:07,222 --> 01:07:08,556
Oh, yeah?
Did it work?

1475
01:07:08,590 --> 01:07:10,258
It did, it did.
Things have gotten

1476
01:07:10,292 --> 01:07:12,260
A lot more...
relaxed around there.

1477
01:07:12,294 --> 01:07:15,063
That's good.
I felt like it would.

this wine at Yale?

1480

Yes, that's right.

1481
01:07:21,203 --> 01:07:22,804
It's really good.

1482
01:07:22,837 --> 01:07:24,272
Well...

1483
01:07:24,306 --> 01:07:26,841
I guess that's it.

give a hand.

for helping me.

That got me so hot.

1491
01:07:46,194 --> 01:07:48,330
It was like role-play.

1492
01:07:50,398 --> 01:07:52,634
You up for some fun
tonight, Professor?

1493
01:07:52,667 --> 01:07:55,303
Me? Oh, no, thanks.

1494
01:07:55,337 --> 01:07:57,239
No? What are you,
gay or something?

1495
01:07:57,272 --> 01:08:00,108
God, she is hotter than
a firecracker right now.

1496

Well, thanks a lot,
you two.

worked out really well.

you're responsible.

I mean,
how can we trust you?

What do you people do?
You know what?

1510
01:09:09,777 --> 01:09:11,379
I need
to call you back.

1511
01:09:11,413 --> 01:09:13,548
I see you, jackass!

1512
01:09:13,581 --> 01:09:15,417
God! You're such
a loser.

1513
01:09:15,450 --> 01:09:17,151
Hey, Margaret.
Sorry, I didn't see you.

1514

Dad escaped.
What?

1515
01:09:20,755 --> 01:09:22,524
They called me
two hours ago.

1516
01:09:22,557 --> 01:09:24,392
He didn't show up
to water aerobics,
and they got worried.

1517
01:09:24,426 --> 01:09:25,960
Why didn't they
call me?

1518
01:09:25,993 --> 01:09:27,795
They tried, but you
never answer your phone.

1519

And God forbid
you get a cell phone.

1520

so well.

1521
01:09:35,570 --> 01:09:37,305
He's fine, Margaret.

1522
01:09:37,339 --> 01:09:38,673
No, he disappeared
again, Charlie!

1523
01:09:38,706 --> 01:09:40,242
He's not fine!

1524
01:09:40,275 --> 01:09:41,509
Okay.

1525
01:09:42,877 --> 01:09:44,246
MARGARET:
He has these episodes,

1526
01:09:44,279 --> 01:09:45,647
And he doesn't know
where he is.

1527
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:47,415
He could be in danger.

1528
01:09:56,491 --> 01:09:58,192
Ohh.

1529
01:10:00,928 --> 01:10:02,430

For your fugitive status,
Professor Thurber.

1531
01:10:04,799 --> 01:10:07,602
Well, I appreciate
that, Sasquatch.

1532

in your shoes...

1533

do you think...

with Charlie?

Professor.

his head on straight.

1540
01:10:28,856 --> 01:10:31,326
I thought when I got
to be this age,

1541
01:10:31,359 --> 01:10:33,495
Things would get
easier.

1542

gets more absurd.

to make a choice

to do with it.

the truth, I swear.

leave like that.

doing all day?

we've been?

to take a walk,

tell somebody.

01:24:58,259 --> 01:24:59,660
So, why do you
want to teach us?

1781
01:25:01,228 --> 01:25:03,364
Well, uh...

1782
01:25:03,397 --> 01:25:04,865
I don't know.

1783
01:25:04,898 --> 01:25:06,733
It's the only thing
I'm good at.

1784
01:25:06,767 --> 01:25:08,135
[Kids laugh]

1785
01:25:08,169 --> 01:25:09,603
No, it really is.

1786
01:25:09,636 --> 01:25:11,138
So...

1787
01:25:11,172 --> 01:25:13,574

[* Dean and Britta:
Ginger Snaps]

1789
01:26:29,783 --> 01:26:32,653

WOMAN:

1791
01:26:38,792 --> 01:26:41,562
* When the ginger snaps

1792
01:26:43,330 --> 01:26:46,233
* When the thunder claps

1793
01:26:47,534 --> 01:26:49,836
* You can cut my hair

1794
01:26:49,870 --> 01:26:51,738
* You can fill my cup

1795
01:26:51,772 --> 01:26:53,974
* You can tell me lies

1796
01:26:54,007 --> 01:26:56,410
* You can make it up

1797
01:26:56,443 --> 01:27:01,948
BOTH: * We're gonna make it
after all *

01:27:09,523 --> 01:27:12,225
* Who's right or wrong

1800
01:27:14,495 --> 01:27:16,263
* It's not a crime

1801
01:27:16,297 --> 01:27:19,232
* To change your mind

1802
01:27:22,836 --> 01:27:25,506
* When the kitchen sinks

1803
01:27:27,040 --> 01:27:30,243
* When the sugar winks

1804
01:27:31,645 --> 01:27:34,748
* When the doctor calls

1805
01:27:36,082 --> 01:27:39,353
* When Niagara falls

1806
01:27:40,587 --> 01:27:42,623
* I'm a wayward Tom

1807
01:27:42,656 --> 01:27:44,958
* I'm a silver streak

1808
01:27:44,991 --> 01:27:47,361
* And the walls have ears

1809
01:27:47,394 --> 01:27:49,062
* But the walls don't speak

1810
01:27:49,095 --> 01:27:54,801
* We're gonna make it
after all *

1811
01:27:58,572 --> 01:28:02,376
* I don't need to know

1812
01:28:02,409 --> 01:28:05,312
* who's right or wrong

1813
01:28:07,448 --> 01:28:09,316
* It's not a crime

1814
01:28:09,350 --> 01:28:12,386
* To change your mind

1815
01:28:15,422 --> 01:28:18,325
* Don't need to know

1816
01:28:19,860 --> 01:28:22,963
* Don't need to know

1817
01:28:24,431 --> 01:28:27,334
