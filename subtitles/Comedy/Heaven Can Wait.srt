1
00:00:37,121 --> 00:00:39,885
Break! Let's move it.

2
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:44,299
20! 29!

3
00:00:59,727 --> 00:01:02,112
All right. You take the inside.

4
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:06,528
On this one,
you take the inside. 54...

5
00:01:06,609 --> 00:01:08,329
Ready, set...

6
00:01:08,402 --> 00:01:09,790
2-85!

7
00:01:13,783 --> 00:01:17,579
Back! Throw! Throw! Throw the ball!

8
00:01:17,661 --> 00:01:19,334
Touchdown, Joe.

9
00:01:19,413 --> 00:01:22,213
- Looking good, isn't he?
- What?

10
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:25,506
Pendleton. He's looking awful good.

11
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:30,261
Fall into it.
All right. Come on, baby.

12
00:01:30,341 --> 00:01:32,761
Set... Hike!

13
00:01:32,843 --> 00:01:33,971
Good movement.

14
00:01:34,053 --> 00:01:37,185
Let's try it again.

15
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:45,192
Go deep.

16
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:47,112
1-83!

17
00:01:53,364 --> 00:01:55,167
He's looking awful good.

18
00:01:55,241 --> 00:01:56,498
Here we go.

19
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:08,010
Hustle back, hustle back.
Come on, guys. Come on.

20
00:02:11,007 --> 00:02:15,099
Opposite left, play past 35.
X-curl on 1.

21
00:02:15,177 --> 00:02:16,565
Ready? Break.

22
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:20,775
4-3, set!

23
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:24,196
- Play past 29...
- 2-81!

24
00:02:28,024 --> 00:02:30,159
Pass! Pass! Pass!

25
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:32,790
Ball! Ball! Ball!

26
00:02:32,862 --> 00:02:36,124
Once again, we had a foul-up
on that scrimmage.

27
00:02:36,198 --> 00:02:38,784
The fullback has been
slow on his block.

28
00:02:38,868 --> 00:02:43,091
The guard almost ran into him.
We got to do it till it's right.

29
00:02:43,164 --> 00:02:46,011
Formation left. Screen right on 2.

30
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:47,673
Ready? Break!

31
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,841
Right, left! Right, left!

32
00:02:53,049 --> 00:02:54,721
4-3...

33
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,093
Se"

34
00:02:56,177 --> 00:02:57,600
2-85!

35
00:03:06,771 --> 00:03:08,823
Looking awful good.

36
00:03:09,482 --> 00:03:14,037
I'm thinking of starting him
on Sunday.

37
00:03:15,863 --> 00:03:19,375
- What about Jarrett?
- Pendleton's looking better.

38
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:20,791
2-81!

39
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:25,800
Pass! Pass! Pass!

40
00:03:25,873 --> 00:03:28,293
Ball! Ball! Ball!

41
00:03:28,376 --> 00:03:30,630
- Is he still on cortisone?
- No.

42
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:32,763
Any kind of painkiller?

43
00:03:32,838 --> 00:03:36,469
- Nothing.
- He's looking awful good.

44
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,638
2-84!

45
00:03:42,848 --> 00:03:44,438
Ball! Ball! Ball!

46
00:03:44,517 --> 00:03:47,981
I never saw a knee like that
heal without surgery.

47
00:03:48,062 --> 00:03:50,826
- He's looking awful good.
- Looking good.

48
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:52,191
Thanks a lot.

49
00:03:52,274 --> 00:03:56,865
- Oh, hi, Joe. How's the knee?
- Good.

50
00:03:56,946 --> 00:03:59,663
What do you think
of the Rams' chances?

51
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:02,291
We're going to the Super Bowl to win.

52
00:04:02,368 --> 00:04:05,915
- No, off the record.
- Off the record?

53
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:08,761
We're going to the Super Bowl to win.

54
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:12,095
- Sure. What about your competition?
- Competition?

55
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:15,966
- Jarrett.
- My competition's 25 other teams.

56
00:04:46,495 --> 00:04:47,504
Max?

57
00:04:48,748 --> 00:04:50,800
- Yeah!
- How you doing?

58
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:52,761
What's in this brown stuff?

59
00:04:52,835 --> 00:04:54,923
Oh, that's mainly whipped liver.

60
00:04:55,004 --> 00:04:57,223
- Liver?
- Yep.

61
00:04:57,298 --> 00:05:01,806
I put a little whey in it, then mix
it with a little alfalfa sprouts,

62
00:05:01,886 --> 00:05:04,899
and some bean curd, and spinach.

63
00:05:04,972 --> 00:05:09,195
It's nice, isn't it?
It's a liver and whey shake.

64
00:05:10,603 --> 00:05:12,275
Happy birthday to you

65
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:14,616
Happy birthday to you

66
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:17,905
Happy birthday, clear Joe

67
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:20,833
Happy birthday to you

68
00:05:20,905 --> 00:05:24,369
I didn't think anybody knew.
Thanks for coming, Max.

69
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:27,214
- Put it here.
- I hope you have a lot more.

70
00:05:27,286 --> 00:05:29,540
Thank you. That's...

71
00:05:31,207 --> 00:05:32,760
What's this?

72
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:39,550
Yeah!

73
00:05:40,257 --> 00:05:41,681
You know something?

74
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,724
At my age, in any other business,
I'd be young.

75
00:05:44,804 --> 00:05:46,773
Look at it this way...

76
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:50,774
Soon you can get into another
business and have a real life.

77
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:51,860
Yeah?

78
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:56,191
I don't know what that means.

79
00:05:56,273 --> 00:05:59,655
This is the only business I know
that's real. I'm stuck.

80
00:05:59,735 --> 00:06:01,787
What do you mean, stuck?

81
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:04,199
I've been working my whole life

82
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:07,211
to get a chance
to do something, and...

83
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:11,544
I don't know if I'm ever going
to get a chance to do it.

84
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:16,472
- No, it's all right.
- I'll fix your neck.

85
00:06:16,544 --> 00:06:19,225
- Don't do that, Joe.
- Wait a minute.

86
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:22,641
- How's that?
- Oh, boy. Yeah.

87
00:06:22,717 --> 00:06:25,896
It scares the hell out of me
every time you do that.

88
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:30,027
If you don't watch how yourtrapezius
goes into your deltoids,

89
00:06:30,099 --> 00:06:34,524
you're going to throw off your entire
cervical and your lumbar areas.

90
00:06:34,603 --> 00:06:37,487
Since I'm the only guy
knows how to fix that,

91
00:06:37,565 --> 00:06:41,326
- you should listen to me.
- Maybe you should trade places.

92
00:06:41,402 --> 00:06:44,036
You be the trainer.
I'll start on Sunday.

93
00:06:44,113 --> 00:06:45,406
Yeahmwhat?

94
00:06:48,993 --> 00:06:51,461
- I'm starting against Dallas?
- Yeah.

95
00:06:51,537 --> 00:06:54,586
They don't want Jarrett.
They want you.

96
00:06:56,709 --> 00:06:58,714
Happy birthday, Joe.

97
00:09:05,546 --> 00:09:09,508
Hey, my watch stopped.
It keeps flashing the same time.

98
00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:12,690
I'm dreaming, huh?

99
00:09:19,643 --> 00:09:21,696
Well, l...

100
00:09:22,188 --> 00:09:23,825
Hey...

101
00:09:23,898 --> 00:09:26,366
This is an aeroplane dream.

102
00:09:26,442 --> 00:09:29,954
I forget what they mean.
I think they're a good sign.

103
00:09:33,074 --> 00:09:35,209
Mr Pendleton.

104
00:09:35,284 --> 00:09:39,081
Mr Pendleton, you must wait for me.
I'm your escort.

105
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:44,544
Wait for me, please, Mr Pendleton.

106
00:09:49,548 --> 00:09:52,514
The end of the line,
Mr Pendleton, please.

107
00:09:52,593 --> 00:09:55,975
Hi. How you doing? You want
to hear a little music?

108
00:09:56,055 --> 00:09:59,816
- You have to wait in line.
- What? This is my dream, isn't it?

109
00:09:59,892 --> 00:10:02,609
You mustn't get out of line. Really!

110
00:10:03,104 --> 00:10:05,987
- Chamberlain, Paul R.
- All right.

111
00:10:06,065 --> 00:10:10,620
I've brought the final passenger.
This manifest is complete.

112
00:10:10,695 --> 00:10:14,456
- Hi.
- You cannot board before your turn.

113
00:10:14,532 --> 00:10:16,619
I don't need a turn.
I'm not boarding.

114
00:10:16,701 --> 00:10:20,758
You don't understand. This is not
your ultimate destination.

115
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:23,416
That will take you to it.

116
00:10:23,499 --> 00:10:27,260
I'm not going. I'm going to run
around till I wake up.

117
00:10:27,336 --> 00:10:32,141
I'm afraid I haven't fully explained
how this system is organised.

118
00:10:32,216 --> 00:10:34,055
The rules derive from yours -

119
00:10:34,135 --> 00:10:38,061
a product of your image and that
of those who share your image.

120
00:10:38,139 --> 00:10:40,607
Violate the rules, the principles...

121
00:10:40,683 --> 00:10:42,984
You want to see a trick?

122
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:46,323
I do this to keep
my abductor pollicis limber.

123
00:10:46,397 --> 00:10:48,983
I don't have a lot of patter with it.

124
00:10:49,066 --> 00:10:52,080
Feel that. That's a 50-cent piece.

125
00:10:52,153 --> 00:10:54,787
I just throw that
into that hand, you see.

126
00:10:54,864 --> 00:10:58,210
I say the magic words, abracadabra.

127
00:10:58,284 --> 00:11:00,503
And then presto, it's gone.

128
00:11:00,578 --> 00:11:04,421
Now, you probably think
I still have it.

129
00:11:04,498 --> 00:11:08,591
You're wrong, cos I can see it
coming out of your ear.

130
00:11:08,669 --> 00:11:11,173
That's the only trick I know.

131
00:11:12,882 --> 00:11:15,266
- Mr Pendleton!
- Gentlemen?

132
00:11:16,927 --> 00:11:19,348
Gentlemen, what's the delay?

133
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:22,858
We've received a new arrival
who refuses to board.

134
00:11:22,933 --> 00:11:26,611
That's impossible. Have you
explained the rules to him?

135
00:11:26,687 --> 00:11:28,527
- Yes, sir.
- Quite clearly?

136
00:11:28,606 --> 00:11:31,109
- Yes, sir.
- And what was his rebuttal?

137
00:11:31,984 --> 00:11:34,036
He took a coin out of my ear.

138
00:11:35,154 --> 00:11:38,369
Did he? Perhaps I should
have a word with him.

139
00:11:39,075 --> 00:11:41,625
Yes, sir. Mr Pendleton!

140
00:11:43,537 --> 00:11:46,088
He's right over there, sir.

141
00:11:46,165 --> 00:11:49,297
- Mr Pendleton!
- Yeah. Hey, you can call me Joe.

142
00:11:50,378 --> 00:11:52,430
How you doing?

143
00:11:52,505 --> 00:11:54,759
Mr Pendleton,
do you know where you are?

144
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,558
I'm in the middle
of a really weird dream.

145
00:11:57,635 --> 00:12:00,600
- You see the problem?
- Joe, come here.

146
00:12:12,191 --> 00:12:15,988
Look at me and listen carefully
to what I'm saying.

147
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:17,280
Yeah?

148
00:12:17,363 --> 00:12:21,124
- This is not a dream.
- Yeah.

149
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:26,587
Life has a certain quality all its
own, a certain feeling. So do dreams.

150
00:12:27,665 --> 00:12:30,002
You know that this is not life,

151
00:12:30,084 --> 00:12:33,927
and you know now
that this is not a dream.

152
00:12:34,005 --> 00:12:38,560
This is a place that comes
after life and after dreams.

153
00:12:38,634 --> 00:12:42,561
I'm sure you'll aware of that
and will take your place.

154
00:12:48,269 --> 00:12:50,108
Are you telling me...?

155
00:13:07,913 --> 00:13:09,669
I'm not supposed to be here.

156
00:13:09,749 --> 00:13:11,339
But you are here.

157
00:13:11,417 --> 00:13:13,256
You guys made a mistake.

158
00:13:13,336 --> 00:13:16,598
This is insupportable.
You're talking to Mr Jordan.

159
00:13:16,672 --> 00:13:20,634
- Anybody can make a mistake.
- Mr Jordan, we're clue to take off.

160
00:13:20,718 --> 00:13:23,186
I have the situation in hand.

161
00:13:23,262 --> 00:13:28,102
If you don't take your place, the
others can't complete their journey.

162
00:13:28,184 --> 00:13:30,687
- Is that fair?
- I'm not supposed to be fair.

163
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:34,364
If this is heaven,
YOU'RE supposed to be fair.

164
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:37,026
This is not heaven.
it's a way station.

165
00:13:37,109 --> 00:13:40,491
- There is no mistake.
- Check on Joseph Pendleton.

166
00:13:40,571 --> 00:13:44,249
When is he clue to arrive
at this way station?

167
00:13:44,325 --> 00:13:49,046
Sir, I don't understand.
A check? Why?

168
00:13:49,121 --> 00:13:52,550
The likelihood of one being right
increases in proportion

169
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:55,887
to how much others try
to prove him wrong.

170
00:13:57,004 --> 00:14:02,936
Pendleton, Joseph. Due to arrive
10.17 am, March 20th, 2025.

171
00:14:04,637 --> 00:14:07,484
Sir, I really can't believe it. I...

172
00:14:07,556 --> 00:14:11,483
I took him out
just before the accident.

173
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,862
You did what?!

174
00:14:13,938 --> 00:14:18,078
You're not supposed to do that,
you must wait for the outcome.

175
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:22,207
But I was so sure, and it looked
like it would be painful.

176
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:25,993
- Wait. Are you saying...?
- Is this your first assignment?

177
00:14:26,075 --> 00:14:27,083
Yes, sir.

178
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:29,627
Haven't you learned the rules?

179
00:14:29,704 --> 00:14:34,212
Every question of life and death
is a probability until the outcome.

180
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:36,427
So he jumped the gun.

181
00:14:36,502 --> 00:14:40,559
Just put me back
and we'll forget the whole thing.

182
00:14:40,631 --> 00:14:43,597
This man must be put back
into his body at once.

183
00:14:43,676 --> 00:14:44,886
Yeah.

184
00:14:46,637 --> 00:14:48,227
Thanks, Mr Jordan.

185
00:14:48,305 --> 00:14:51,153
Hey, I'll see you in about 50 years.

186
00:15:03,029 --> 00:15:04,321
Hey, hey, Max.

187
00:15:04,405 --> 00:15:07,917
- Max, I'm back.
- He can't hear you, Mr Pendleton.

188
00:15:07,992 --> 00:15:13,793
I hope they got the best football
team in America in heaven,

189
00:15:13,873 --> 00:15:16,423
and I hope God makes you
first-string.

190
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:20,297
Oh. Max, I'm going to get
my body back.

191
00:15:20,379 --> 00:15:22,716
Where's my body?

192
00:15:26,177 --> 00:15:27,600
Oh, clear.

193
00:15:27,678 --> 00:15:29,185
Cremated. I see.

194
00:15:29,263 --> 00:15:31,814
I'm starting against Dallas
on Sunday.

195
00:15:31,891 --> 00:15:35,319
The body you occupied
on Earth has been cremated.

196
00:15:35,394 --> 00:15:38,988
Uncremate me! You must be able
to do something right.

197
00:15:39,065 --> 00:15:43,324
Do the words “not being a good sport“
mean anything to you?

198
00:15:43,402 --> 00:15:45,870
We can put you
into another man's body,

199
00:15:45,946 --> 00:15:49,043
provided his death
has not yet been discovered.

200
00:15:49,116 --> 00:15:52,462
Are you kidding? Put me
into the body of another man?

201
00:15:52,536 --> 00:15:54,755
I just got my body back in shape.

202
00:15:54,830 --> 00:16:00,549
Joe, the only way you can return to
life is in the body of another man.

203
00:16:02,004 --> 00:16:05,433
I shall have to take charge
of this case personally.

204
00:16:07,218 --> 00:16:11,809
Incredibly graceful. He's about
your age and in perfect condition.

205
00:16:11,889 --> 00:16:14,772
He's too short.
He'd never see over the line.

206
00:16:18,187 --> 00:16:22,743
You know what kind of shape you gotta
be in to get to the Super Bowl?

207
00:16:22,817 --> 00:16:25,071
Yes, Joe. I understand.

208
00:16:29,365 --> 00:16:32,877
- He's not talking English.
- I told you he was German.

209
00:16:32,952 --> 00:16:35,288
Hey, you talk any English?

210
00:16:35,371 --> 00:16:37,874
We can't be seen or heard, Joe.

211
00:16:37,957 --> 00:16:40,128
Well, I don't want to talk German.

212
00:16:43,421 --> 00:16:47,597
- I gotta call plays in English.
- Joe, if you could not so much lower

213
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:50,648
but broaden your standards.

214
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,979
We've seen many bodies
and the choices are becoming limited.

215
00:17:03,065 --> 00:17:06,494
- Julia, I beg of you.
- I want a drink.

216
00:17:06,569 --> 00:17:09,499
- There's plenty...
- I've got to have a drink.

217
00:17:10,906 --> 00:17:14,169
Mr Farnsworth loathes
cold cucumber soup.

218
00:17:16,203 --> 00:17:18,837
Hey, this is some house.
Who lives here?

219
00:17:18,914 --> 00:17:22,758
Leo Farnsworth,
a man of enormous power.

220
00:17:22,835 --> 00:17:25,599
...later this afternoon.

221
00:17:25,671 --> 00:17:27,926
Thank you, Sisk.

222
00:17:28,007 --> 00:17:30,937
Just leave the door open
as you leave, Sisk.

223
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:32,433
Thank you very much.

224
00:17:32,511 --> 00:17:35,062
The more servants who see us,
the better.

225
00:17:35,139 --> 00:17:38,770
- You're kidding?
- That's not Farnsworth.

226
00:17:38,851 --> 00:17:40,274
- Give me a drink.
- No.

227
00:17:40,353 --> 00:17:42,155
Who are they?

228
00:17:42,229 --> 00:17:44,863
His wife and confidential secretary.

229
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,115
You hate me.

230
00:17:46,192 --> 00:17:49,905
- Don't be ridiculous. I love you.
- I want a drink! Tony...

231
00:17:49,987 --> 00:17:52,787
It would be better
if you didn't drink.

232
00:17:52,865 --> 00:17:55,962
How long will it be
before they find him?

233
00:17:56,035 --> 00:17:58,752
I don't know, darling. Not long.

234
00:17:58,829 --> 00:18:01,547
- I'm glad we did it.
- We couldn't help it.

235
00:18:01,624 --> 00:18:05,337
It would be better
if you'd try not to unravel now.

236
00:18:05,419 --> 00:18:06,677
Thank you, Julia.

237
00:18:06,754 --> 00:18:09,969
- Is Farnsworth dead yet?
- Not yet.

238
00:18:10,049 --> 00:18:13,596
What's the matter with him?
He can't keep his eyes open.

239
00:18:13,678 --> 00:18:17,604
He's been drugged by those two
downstairs. This is a murder.

240
00:18:17,682 --> 00:18:21,561
You see how he's slowly
sliding into the water?

241
00:18:21,644 --> 00:18:23,281
Hey, somebody, get...!

242
00:18:26,941 --> 00:18:29,195
Hey, get a doctor.
There's a guy...

243
00:18:29,276 --> 00:18:33,120
Get a doctor. You got a guy
drowning in the bathtub.

244
00:18:33,197 --> 00:18:37,669
- You left a pot on the carpet.
- I can't hold everything at once.

245
00:18:37,743 --> 00:18:41,172
Mrs Farnsworth would kill you,
if she saw that.

246
00:18:41,247 --> 00:18:43,418
Hey, somebody! You got, uh...

247
00:18:43,499 --> 00:18:45,469
- Give me a drink!
- Please.

248
00:18:45,543 --> 00:18:50,134
- Don't go overboard.
- Look, everyone wanted him dead.

249
00:18:50,214 --> 00:18:52,433
I should be canonised!

250
00:18:52,508 --> 00:18:54,513
Perhaps one drink.

251
00:18:54,593 --> 00:18:57,856
- Where can he be?
- I'm sorry.

252
00:18:57,930 --> 00:18:59,520
What harm can that do him?

253
00:18:59,598 --> 00:19:02,446
He deserves to be dead.

254
00:19:02,518 --> 00:19:05,900
They didn't? No kidding?
They're murderers.

255
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:09,574
- What's going on?
- I'm sorry, sir. it's Miss Logan,

256
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:12,154
- to see Mr Farnsworth.
- Show her in.

257
00:19:12,236 --> 00:19:14,870
- Yes, sir.
- Oh, my God...

258
00:19:14,947 --> 00:19:18,827
No. it's the perfect alibi.
She insists on seeing him.

259
00:19:18,909 --> 00:19:20,463
Let's find another body.

260
00:19:20,536 --> 00:19:22,257
A servant will find him.

261
00:19:22,329 --> 00:19:25,960
Excuse yourself and keep Sisk
with you at all times...

262
00:19:26,042 --> 00:19:27,429
Let's get out of here.

263
00:19:27,501 --> 00:19:29,008
Miss Logan, sir.

264
00:19:30,838 --> 00:19:33,139
Oh, Miss Logan. I'm Tony Abbott.

265
00:19:33,215 --> 00:19:36,478
This is the library.

266
00:19:36,552 --> 00:19:38,355
That's Mrs Farnsworth.

267
00:19:38,429 --> 00:19:41,810
Hello. I'm going
into the living room.

268
00:19:41,891 --> 00:19:45,438
- Want to come, Sisk?
- Oh, certainly, madam.

269
00:19:47,104 --> 00:19:51,280
I'm Mr Farnsworth's personal
and private executive secretary.

270
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:53,660
I didn't know whether you knew that.

271
00:19:53,736 --> 00:19:57,746
- I'm sorry he's not down yet.
- That's all right. I'll wait.

272
00:19:57,823 --> 00:20:00,327
- Would you take a seat?
- No, thank you.

273
00:20:01,827 --> 00:20:04,757
Perhaps you'd like
to tell me what it's about.

274
00:20:06,749 --> 00:20:09,846
Mr Farnsworth has been sent
hundreds of letters

275
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:11,722
from Pagglesham in England.

276
00:20:11,796 --> 00:20:15,343
The people who live there -
1,600, including my father -

277
00:20:15,424 --> 00:20:17,809
are to be evicted from their homes

278
00:20:17,885 --> 00:20:20,982
to make way for the proposed
Exo-Grey refinery.

279
00:20:21,055 --> 00:20:24,686
Hundreds of families
will be forced to find other homes.

280
00:20:24,767 --> 00:20:27,780
The few who remain
will have their health endangered

281
00:20:27,853 --> 00:20:34,450
by poisoning of their air and water,
the evidence for which I have here,

282
00:20:34,527 --> 00:20:39,533
along with a petition signed
by the 1,673 citizens of that area.

283
00:20:40,449 --> 00:20:44,246
This is what I'm here
to see Mr Farnsworth about.

284
00:20:44,328 --> 00:20:47,425
Mr Farnsworth conducts business
at his office.

285
00:20:47,498 --> 00:20:50,547
I've been to his office.
He refused to see me.

286
00:20:50,626 --> 00:20:53,130
I seriously doubt he'd see you here.

287
00:20:53,212 --> 00:20:55,680
He'll have to, I'm not leaving.

288
00:20:58,217 --> 00:20:59,475
L\\ \ \ \\, \

289
00:20:59,552 --> 00:21:02,517
I'm not leaving.
I've come 8,000 miles

290
00:21:02,596 --> 00:21:05,729
to do something
about a terrible injustice

291
00:21:05,808 --> 00:21:10,981
that this man has perpetrated
on hundreds of defenceless people.

292
00:21:11,063 --> 00:21:14,326
- Somebody ought to help her.
- You can help her.

293
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,823
You can be Farnsworth.

294
00:21:15,901 --> 00:21:19,698
If Mr Farnsworth doesn't see me,
I don't know what I'll do.

295
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:21,750
Is that a threat?

296
00:21:21,824 --> 00:21:23,331
Yes.

297
00:21:23,409 --> 00:21:25,628
I'd like to help
but not as Farnsworth.

298
00:21:25,703 --> 00:21:27,673
The decision is yours.

299
00:21:27,747 --> 00:21:30,167
You give me no choice, Sisk!

300
00:21:30,249 --> 00:21:34,129
If I had to be Farnsworth,
could we do it temporary?

301
00:21:34,211 --> 00:21:35,718
Yes.

302
00:21:35,796 --> 00:21:39,178
We could arrange that if you wish it.

303
00:21:40,718 --> 00:21:45,273
Sisk, please tell Mr Farnsworth Miss
Logan is here and refuses to leave.

304
00:21:45,348 --> 00:21:46,558
Yes, sir.

305
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,603
If you really want to help her,
you'd better hurry.

306
00:21:50,686 --> 00:21:54,483
- Well, it's only temporary, right?
- That's correct.

307
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:59,035
Only Farnsworth can help her.

308
00:21:59,111 --> 00:22:01,615
Once the body's discovered,
it'll be too late.

309
00:22:11,791 --> 00:22:13,796
Hey.

310
00:22:13,876 --> 00:22:15,217
That's me.

311
00:22:16,128 --> 00:22:17,682
I haven't changed.

312
00:22:21,008 --> 00:22:22,266
It's just me.

313
00:22:22,343 --> 00:22:23,814
Mr Farnsworth?

314
00:22:23,886 --> 00:22:25,274
Now what do we do?

315
00:22:25,346 --> 00:22:27,398
Are you there, sir?

316
00:22:27,473 --> 00:22:30,819
I'll never get away with this.
What will we do now?

317
00:22:30,893 --> 00:22:32,696
Are you all right?

318
00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:35,618
- Answer him.
- People can hear me now?

319
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:38,869
- Of course.
- But he knows the other guy's voice.

320
00:22:38,943 --> 00:22:41,577
Mr Farnsworth,
is everything all right?

321
00:22:41,654 --> 00:22:42,995
Answer him.

322
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:49,129
Will you take it easy?
I'll be out in a minute.

323
00:22:49,203 --> 00:22:50,461
Very good, sir.

324
00:22:51,789 --> 00:22:53,082
It works.

325
00:22:53,165 --> 00:22:55,135
Of course. You haven't changed.

326
00:22:55,209 --> 00:22:58,673
You're still Joe Pendleton.
That's what you and I see.

327
00:22:58,754 --> 00:23:03,511
But outwardly, you're Leo Farnsworth,
and that's what everyone else sees.

328
00:23:12,768 --> 00:23:15,105
Miss Betty Logan is downstairs, sir.

329
00:23:15,187 --> 00:23:17,489
She insists on seeing you.
Will you dress?

330
00:23:17,565 --> 00:23:20,946
Oh, sure, sure.

331
00:23:21,027 --> 00:23:22,319
Very good, sir.

332
00:23:22,403 --> 00:23:26,283
You mean I sound like this guy,
no matter what I talk like?

333
00:23:26,365 --> 00:23:29,046
I beg your pardon, Mr Farnsworth?

334
00:23:29,118 --> 00:23:30,874
You see?

335
00:23:37,209 --> 00:23:38,716
Well...

336
00:23:50,222 --> 00:23:52,726
Julia, Julia, please, please, clear.

337
00:23:52,808 --> 00:23:55,941
- Please, clear, not now. Not now.
- I want a sip.

338
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:59,863
You're sorry you have me, aren't you?
You wish he were alive.

339
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:04,116
- Julia, please.
- Why don't you say it's not true?

340
00:24:04,195 --> 00:24:07,742
- You didn't say it's not true.
- it's not true.

341
00:24:07,823 --> 00:24:10,753
- Say it again.
- Darling, it's not true.

342
00:24:10,826 --> 00:24:12,629
I don't hate you. I love you.

343
00:24:14,413 --> 00:24:17,131
- There, sir.
- Thank you. Thank you.

344
00:24:22,463 --> 00:24:24,302
Your helmet, sir.

345
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,394
Your polo helmet, sir.

346
00:24:26,467 --> 00:24:29,397
Oh, thanks. Thanks. Do I play polo?

347
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:32,187
- Oh, not really, sir.
- Sir?

348
00:24:34,308 --> 00:24:35,945
Thank you. Thank you.

349
00:24:36,018 --> 00:24:39,612
- This Logan girl is a godsend.
- What's taking so long?

350
00:24:39,689 --> 00:24:42,951
Pretend you're reading.

351
00:24:43,025 --> 00:24:45,280
- All right.
- You go up.

352
00:24:54,203 --> 00:24:55,710
Miss Logan, sir.

353
00:24:55,788 --> 00:24:58,374
Hi. How you doing?

354
00:24:58,457 --> 00:25:02,598
I'm not leaving until you've
heard what I have to say.

355
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:04,757
Uh, oh, yeah. Well, good.

356
00:25:07,216 --> 00:25:11,641
Mr Farnsworth, you've been sent
hundreds of letters from Pagglesham.

357
00:25:11,721 --> 00:25:14,900
- I know about that.
- Have you read the letters?

358
00:25:14,974 --> 00:25:16,896
Well... Er...

359
00:25:16,976 --> 00:25:20,073
- Well, no.
- No. I suspected as much.

360
00:25:20,146 --> 00:25:25,864
That's why I've flown over here.
I and the 1,673 people I represent

361
00:25:25,943 --> 00:25:28,791
and whose names are on this petition

362
00:25:28,863 --> 00:25:32,457
will not have their futures
determined by bureaucrats

363
00:25:32,533 --> 00:25:35,546
at the beck and call
of certain industrialists

364
00:25:35,619 --> 00:25:41,753
for whom the elderly and children
are just figures in a ledger.

365
00:25:41,834 --> 00:25:44,338
- Do I make myself clear?
- Yeah, but...

366
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:49,474
There are no buts. You can call
your guards and have me dragged out.

367
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:52,647
- It would be bad publicity.
- Well...

368
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,603
- Why don't just sit down?
- I prefer to stand.

369
00:25:55,681 --> 00:25:57,022
We can stand.

370
00:25:57,099 --> 00:26:01,156
I've made it my business to find out
about Exo-Grey Industries.

371
00:26:01,228 --> 00:26:05,239
Facts that would make
interesting newspaper copy.

372
00:26:06,525 --> 00:26:08,577
Your tea, Mr Farnsworth.

373
00:26:08,652 --> 00:26:10,823
Oh, right... Yeah.

374
00:26:10,905 --> 00:26:13,918
My tea.

375
00:26:13,991 --> 00:26:16,874
Will there be anything else,
Mr Farnsworth?

376
00:26:16,952 --> 00:26:19,005
No. I think that's about it.

377
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,633
Thanks a lot.

378
00:26:20,706 --> 00:26:22,047
You want some tea?

379
00:26:22,124 --> 00:26:25,553
I want to know what you're
doing about Pagglesham.

380
00:26:27,171 --> 00:26:28,263
PaQQHesham!

381
00:26:28,339 --> 00:26:30,558
It's what we're talking about!

382
00:26:30,633 --> 00:26:33,812
These people care very much
that their community

383
00:26:33,886 --> 00:26:37,101
isn't destroyed in the name
of free enterprise.

384
00:26:37,181 --> 00:26:41,737
A community where families
have lived for generations...

385
00:26:41,811 --> 00:26:43,152
I know.

386
00:26:43,229 --> 00:26:47,903
These people will not let you
intimidate and frighten them.

387
00:26:47,983 --> 00:26:49,324
I don't frighten anybody.

388
00:27:02,415 --> 00:27:04,171
What in God's name was that?

389
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:06,171
Well, that...

390
00:27:06,252 --> 00:27:09,965
My...my Mrs Farnsworth.

391
00:27:11,966 --> 00:27:13,556
Sorry to disturb you.

392
00:27:13,634 --> 00:27:16,849
Mrs Farnsworth saw a mouse,
but she's better now.

393
00:27:16,929 --> 00:27:18,602
She just saw a mouse?

394
00:27:18,681 --> 00:27:21,528
No. Before. Outside.
But she relives it.

395
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:26,606
I'll be in the other room
if you need me, sir. Excuse me.

396
00:27:26,689 --> 00:27:28,528
What's the matter with her?

397
00:27:28,607 --> 00:27:33,329
Well, listen. I don't know.
it's really none of my business.

398
00:27:33,404 --> 00:27:36,916
- Your wife's not your business?
- You don't understand.

399
00:27:37,283 --> 00:27:41,293
I understand one thing. We will
never let you build that refinery.

400
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:45,048
All right. I'll build my refinery
in some other place.

401
00:27:45,124 --> 00:27:49,466
Very funny. If you think I'm going
back to Pagglesham, you're wrong.

402
00:27:49,545 --> 00:27:51,431
You're not afraid of me.

403
00:27:51,505 --> 00:27:55,765
You think a schoolteacher is no
challenge for a famous industrialist.

404
00:27:55,843 --> 00:27:58,643
- Believe me...
- Will you please listen?

405
00:27:58,721 --> 00:28:01,224
- Just be quiet a minute.
- Leo...

406
00:28:01,307 --> 00:28:02,897
Just let me say one thing.

407
00:28:02,975 --> 00:28:05,194
- What is it?
- Sit down.

408
00:28:08,314 --> 00:28:11,113
- Why?
- If you'd just sit down,

409
00:28:11,192 --> 00:28:16,162
I think I can explain something
that'll clear this whole thing up.

410
00:28:23,996 --> 00:28:26,962
I'm not really Leo Farnsworth.

411
00:28:27,041 --> 00:28:29,924
- What?
- My name is Joe.

412
00:28:30,002 --> 00:28:31,805
Very funny, Mr Farnsworth.

413
00:28:31,879 --> 00:28:35,806
I'm sure you enjoy playing
these insulting little games.

414
00:28:35,883 --> 00:28:39,347
However, I know about
your board meeting on Thursday,

415
00:28:39,428 --> 00:28:41,350
which may mean nothing to you,

416
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:45,986
but if you think you can treat women
with the same manipulative contempt

417
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:48,860
your company treats
communities of the world,

418
00:28:48,938 --> 00:28:52,948
you've a lot to learn about
the strength of people like myself.

419
00:28:53,025 --> 00:28:56,572
Don't think you're getting away
with this. You're not!

420
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,130
You got till that board
meeting on Thursday

421
00:29:04,203 --> 00:29:07,585
to find me a body
that can play quarterback.

422
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,546
Darling, I'm going to let you go.

423
00:29:13,629 --> 00:29:16,892
I'm going to let you go now.
Please stop screaming.

424
00:29:16,966 --> 00:29:19,896
Listen. There is nothing
to be frightened of.

425
00:29:19,969 --> 00:29:24,228
There's plenty to be worried about,
but nothing to be frightened of.

426
00:29:24,306 --> 00:29:27,272
Are you all right? Can I trust you?

427
00:29:27,351 --> 00:29:29,191
Yes, clearest?

428
00:29:31,605 --> 00:29:34,820
- You locked me in a closet.
- Only for a moment.

429
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:37,748
- What did you tell him?
- You saw a mouse.

430
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:41,996
Look, I'm no good
at spur-of-the-moment alibis.

431
00:29:42,074 --> 00:29:45,835
He's probably got enough evidence
to lock us away forever.

432
00:29:45,911 --> 00:29:50,420
I don't understand this.
I saw him inhale the nose spray.

433
00:29:50,499 --> 00:29:54,011
He never really inhaled it.
He overheard us somehow.

434
00:29:54,086 --> 00:29:56,804
Maybe he's got us bugged right now.

435
00:29:56,881 --> 00:30:00,143
No, an electronics expert
sweeps the place daily.

436
00:30:00,217 --> 00:30:04,014
- He's afraid of being bugged, too.
- He's playing with us.

437
00:30:04,096 --> 00:30:07,857
He's playing a game with us,
that's what it is.

438
00:30:07,933 --> 00:30:09,820
You locked me in a closet. Why?

439
00:30:11,771 --> 00:30:12,814
Hello.

440
00:30:12,897 --> 00:30:15,447
Mr Farnsworth would like
to see you now.

441
00:30:15,524 --> 00:30:19,237
Yes, indeed. Yes. Would you
excuse me, Mrs Farnsworth?

442
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:21,242
Yes, of course, Mr Abbott.

443
00:30:24,617 --> 00:30:28,294
We could raise it at the meeting,
but I'm sure it's legal.

444
00:30:28,371 --> 00:30:31,419
But can't something be legal
but still wrong?

445
00:30:31,499 --> 00:30:34,263
- In what sense?
- Bad for somebody else.

446
00:30:34,335 --> 00:30:35,972
What are you referring to?

447
00:30:36,045 --> 00:30:39,557
Like this refinery in Pagglesham.

448
00:30:41,342 --> 00:30:44,355
- Was that the living room?
- That was my office.

449
00:30:44,428 --> 00:30:46,848
- My coordination is shot?
- Yes, sir.

450
00:30:46,931 --> 00:30:49,102
- Just not my clay.
- No, sir.

451
00:30:52,103 --> 00:30:56,611
I wanted to discuss the Haitian
arrangement. The 2.5 million acres.

452
00:30:56,691 --> 00:30:59,111
- 2.5 million acres?
- The sugar deal.

453
00:30:59,193 --> 00:31:00,913
- It's no good.
- The deal?

454
00:31:00,986 --> 00:31:03,241
No, the sugar. It's bad for the body.

455
00:31:03,322 --> 00:31:05,826
Shall I speak
to the Haitian ambassador?

456
00:31:05,908 --> 00:31:09,455
No, check on Pagglesham,
see if we're hurting anybody.

457
00:31:09,537 --> 00:31:12,301
- If we're hurting anybody?
- Yeah.

458
00:31:22,883 --> 00:31:25,138
Is the wicket bugged?

459
00:31:28,305 --> 00:31:31,235
We certainly wouldn't
want to hurt anybody.

460
00:31:31,308 --> 00:31:35,817
That's the last thing Exo-Grey
would ever want to do, right?

461
00:31:35,896 --> 00:31:38,233
Yeah. We don't want to hurt anybody.

462
00:31:38,315 --> 00:31:39,656
Thank you.

463
00:31:41,986 --> 00:31:42,994
Pagglesham.

464
00:32:00,087 --> 00:32:03,266
He pretended not to know
what a stockholder was!

465
00:32:03,341 --> 00:32:08,062
I can't tell if he's toying with me
or actually precipitating a crisis.

466
00:32:08,137 --> 00:32:11,150
He's toying.
He won't forget being drugged.

467
00:32:11,223 --> 00:32:14,936
- Why would he pretend?
- Why pretend to inhale the spray?

468
00:32:15,019 --> 00:32:17,605
To bait us.
He's waiting for us to crack.

469
00:32:17,688 --> 00:32:21,829
Do you think he's playing
that saxophone? it's a tape.

470
00:32:21,901 --> 00:32:24,535
That's why we keep hearing
the same song.

471
00:32:24,612 --> 00:32:28,206
It's like those
idiot costumes of his...

472
00:32:28,282 --> 00:32:30,750
You are dumb, aren't you?

473
00:33:28,509 --> 00:33:31,190
Thanks. Thank you.

474
00:33:37,018 --> 00:33:39,023
Their magic number is one,

475
00:33:39,103 --> 00:33:43,113
meaning a Ram victory Sunday
or next week against the Falcons

476
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:47,497
or a 49er loss, and the Rams clinch
the NFL Western Division title.

477
00:33:47,570 --> 00:33:49,622
The way they're playing,

478
00:33:49,697 --> 00:33:53,754
the team feels this is the Rams' year
to go to the Super Bowl.

479
00:33:53,826 --> 00:34:00,588
Jarrett has completed an astounding
62% of his passes for 18 touchdowns.

480
00:34:00,666 --> 00:34:03,680
The defence has given up
but 10 points a game,

481
00:34:03,753 --> 00:34:06,552
while the offence
scores 21 points a game.

482
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:08,683
The Rams' record is the best...

483
00:34:33,741 --> 00:34:37,882
What you're saying is that
nobody should have that information,

484
00:34:37,953 --> 00:34:42,462
because if two big companies get
together, they're worth more money?

485
00:34:42,541 --> 00:34:44,214
Yes, sir.

486
00:34:44,293 --> 00:34:48,469
That's why the rumour of a merger
makes the price of the stock rise.

487
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:54,097
If it's supposed to be a secret,
how does the rumour start?

488
00:34:54,178 --> 00:34:57,690
Well, sir, wrong as it seems,
they leak it.

489
00:34:57,765 --> 00:34:59,735
But that's dishonest.

490
00:35:00,768 --> 00:35:01,979
Yes, it is.

491
00:35:11,237 --> 00:35:12,743
Well...

492
00:35:12,822 --> 00:35:15,242
if I got a board meeting tomorrow,

493
00:35:15,324 --> 00:35:18,207
I got to do a lot
of studying tonight.

494
00:35:18,285 --> 00:35:20,006
Yes, sir.

495
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:22,843
How you doing down there?

496
00:35:22,915 --> 00:35:25,798
Oh, I'm doing fine.
Thank you very much.

497
00:35:25,876 --> 00:35:28,427
Yeah? Thanks.

498
00:35:28,504 --> 00:35:30,177
Thanks a lot.

499
00:35:32,216 --> 00:35:34,933
Say, thanks for dinner.

500
00:35:41,642 --> 00:35:43,778
I think we should do it right away.

501
00:35:43,853 --> 00:35:46,736
Sisk, may we have some
more coffee, please?

502
00:36:12,798 --> 00:36:14,969
And now for your hat, sir.

503
00:36:15,051 --> 00:36:18,230
Do you wish the homburg
or the bowler, sir,

504
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:21,234
or something that makes
more of a statement?

505
00:36:21,307 --> 00:36:22,648
Whatever you say.

506
00:36:22,725 --> 00:36:26,605
Why have I got so many
of these sailor outfits?

507
00:36:26,687 --> 00:36:29,617
Oh, sir, you have
always fancied the sea.

508
00:36:30,691 --> 00:36:31,699
Do I sail?

509
00:36:33,319 --> 00:36:35,656
Not really, sir.

510
00:36:37,239 --> 00:36:38,580
OK, OK.

511
00:37:29,125 --> 00:37:31,675
Mr Farnsworth,
I'm Helen Rich from The Times.

512
00:37:31,752 --> 00:37:34,718
I have this petition
from the citizens of Pagglesham.

513
00:37:34,797 --> 00:37:37,051
Do you plan to do anything about it?

514
00:37:37,133 --> 00:37:41,143
We're taking it into consideration.
We really have to be going.

515
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:42,727
Excuse us.

516
00:37:42,805 --> 00:37:47,610
Is it true that the new factories
will displace 11 communities?

517
00:37:47,685 --> 00:37:51,316
- Is it that many?
- They granted permits, didn't they?

518
00:37:51,397 --> 00:37:55,656
- I guess so, if we got 'em.
- How did Exo-Grey get those permits?

519
00:37:55,735 --> 00:37:58,119
Beats me. I guess we bribed somebody.

520
00:37:58,195 --> 00:38:00,082
- He's joking.
- Funny.

521
00:38:00,156 --> 00:38:01,828
Really, we must be going.

522
00:38:03,659 --> 00:38:07,005
- What about Acrilonitrile?
- What about what?

523
00:38:07,079 --> 00:38:10,876
The toxic substance released
by the plastic bottles you market,

524
00:38:10,958 --> 00:38:15,300
despite the lawsuit forcing you to
delay until the effects are tested.

525
00:38:15,379 --> 00:38:19,472
- We really must go.
- I've been studying this thing.

526
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:23,512
I've got it figured out, so come
and see what's going on yourselves.

527
00:38:23,596 --> 00:38:27,772
- You can't have outsiders...
- Sure we can. Come in, everybody.

528
00:38:27,850 --> 00:38:29,487
Is he kidding?

529
00:38:29,935 --> 00:38:33,234
This can be taken care of.

530
00:38:35,941 --> 00:38:37,199
Hi.

531
00:38:51,248 --> 00:38:53,336
Hi. How you doing, everybody?

532
00:38:53,417 --> 00:38:57,048
These people are reporters
from some of the newspapers.

533
00:38:57,129 --> 00:39:01,140
I thought it would be good
if they saw how we did things.

534
00:39:01,217 --> 00:39:03,898
Leo, this is a very
dangerous precedent.

535
00:39:03,969 --> 00:39:06,899
We have a very full agenda
today already.

536
00:39:06,972 --> 00:39:09,690
I don't see that we
have time for a press...

537
00:39:09,767 --> 00:39:14,406
Mr Farnsworth, is it true that
an accident in your nuclear plant

538
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:18,241
could stimulate seismic activity
in the San Andreas Fault

539
00:39:18,317 --> 00:39:21,117
and destroy most
of southern California?

540
00:39:21,195 --> 00:39:23,876
I think you'd have to define destroy.

541
00:39:23,948 --> 00:39:28,705
Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen,
I'd like to make something clear.

542
00:39:28,786 --> 00:39:31,799
The Exo-Grey nuclear facility
has a foolproof

543
00:39:31,872 --> 00:39:36,796
built-in safety system that
guarantees no danger of any kind.

544
00:39:36,877 --> 00:39:38,301
That's rubbish.

545
00:39:38,379 --> 00:39:41,973
If there's no danger,
why are we in a lawsuit?

546
00:39:42,049 --> 00:39:44,730
It's a protest, not a lawsuit.

547
00:39:44,802 --> 00:39:47,602
The point is
we're doing something wrong.

548
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:51,393
Everybody's suing us.
We got a lawsuit from a refinery,

549
00:39:51,475 --> 00:39:56,909
a nuclear lawsuit,
a guy named Porpoise is suing us.

550
00:39:56,981 --> 00:39:58,986
Mr Farnsworth,
that's an ecological suit

551
00:39:59,066 --> 00:40:03,159
against our canning factory
for destroying porpoises.

552
00:40:06,574 --> 00:40:08,495
For God's sake, he knows that.

553
00:40:08,576 --> 00:40:11,079
We can porpoises?

554
00:40:11,162 --> 00:40:14,341
- Our San Diego fleet...
- As everybody knows,

555
00:40:14,415 --> 00:40:19,802
we can tuna...and in netting the
tuna, we kill a number of porpoises.

556
00:40:19,879 --> 00:40:26,226
Since they're mammals of alleged high
intelligence, there's been an outcry.

557
00:40:26,302 --> 00:40:31,225
Yeah, well... Yeah... Yeah.

558
00:40:31,307 --> 00:40:34,154
I would just like
to ask you a question.

559
00:40:34,226 --> 00:40:37,406
Why is he bringing the press in here?

560
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:41,157
- You know Leo Farnsworth.
- Maybe I don't know him.

561
00:40:41,233 --> 00:40:42,444
Exactly.

562
00:40:42,526 --> 00:40:46,667
We have a responsibility
to thousands of shareholders

563
00:40:46,739 --> 00:40:51,413
of moderate means, less well off than
the ecological groups fighting us.

564
00:40:53,079 --> 00:40:57,005
If we were a football team,
would you call this a winning season?

565
00:41:00,628 --> 00:41:02,597
I haven't the faintest idea...

566
00:41:02,672 --> 00:41:06,219
Just generally. Would you say
we got a winning season?

567
00:41:07,343 --> 00:41:10,807
I would say on balance we have had
an extremely good year.

568
00:41:10,888 --> 00:41:12,727
We've got a winning season.

569
00:41:12,807 --> 00:41:15,690
What do you do when
you're ahead in the game?

570
00:41:15,768 --> 00:41:20,074
- I don't know what you want.
- You don't make mistakes.

571
00:41:20,147 --> 00:41:23,944
You don't gamble unnecessarily.
You protect your lead.

572
00:41:24,026 --> 00:41:26,114
You don't pass from your own end.

573
00:41:26,195 --> 00:41:28,366
You make sure nobody gets hurt.

574
00:41:28,447 --> 00:41:31,413
You got to use these
guys in the next game.

575
00:41:31,492 --> 00:41:36,747
We won this game. We got to stay
in shape for the rest of the game.

576
00:41:36,831 --> 00:41:40,841
It's like when everybody was supposed
to stop eating grapes.

577
00:41:40,918 --> 00:41:43,006
I didn't because I like grapes.

578
00:41:43,087 --> 00:41:45,507
A lot of guys will keep eating tuna.

579
00:41:45,589 --> 00:41:49,386
What if we had a good-guy
tuna company on the porpoise team?

580
00:41:49,468 --> 00:41:54,474
A lot of guys would buy that so their
kids wouldn't get mad, right?

581
00:41:54,557 --> 00:41:58,187
I don't think they're
taking into account...the expense.

582
00:41:58,269 --> 00:42:02,492
We don't care how much it costs,
just how much it makes.

583
00:42:02,565 --> 00:42:05,495
If it costs too much,
we charge a penny more.

584
00:42:05,568 --> 00:42:08,332
Would you pay more
to save a fish who thinks?

585
00:42:08,404 --> 00:42:11,536
- Wait...
- We handle all lawsuits that way.

586
00:42:11,615 --> 00:42:14,499
Let other teams build plants
in the wrong places.

587
00:42:14,577 --> 00:42:16,664
Let the other quarterback
throw a gurgle

588
00:42:16,746 --> 00:42:20,886
so newspapers get hold of it
and stockholders don't like it.

589
00:42:20,958 --> 00:42:27,341
Let's be the team that makes the
rules. Let's be the popular players.

590
00:42:27,423 --> 00:42:32,180
Forget these nuclear power plants
until we know they're safe.

591
00:42:32,261 --> 00:42:35,643
That Pagglesham refinery,
we'll have to relocate it.

592
00:42:35,723 --> 00:42:38,440
It'll cost us $35 million,
but we don't care,

593
00:42:38,517 --> 00:42:41,068
because we'll come out ahead
in the end.

594
00:42:41,145 --> 00:42:45,238
That plastic stuff we're making,
we'll have to stop.

595
00:42:45,316 --> 00:42:47,784
We're not here forjust one game.

596
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:50,494
We're going all the way
to the Super Bowl!

597
00:42:50,571 --> 00:42:52,623
When we get there,
let's already have won!

598
00:43:18,683 --> 00:43:20,070
Hi. How you doing?

599
00:43:21,477 --> 00:43:24,111
Fine, thank you.
Very well. I'm just...

600
00:43:24,188 --> 00:43:25,695
What is happening?

601
00:43:25,773 --> 00:43:29,830
...give the Rams advantage
through the playoffs.

602
00:43:29,902 --> 00:43:32,619
The Super Bowl is set
for the Coliseum.

603
00:43:32,697 --> 00:43:37,751
If he weren't going to be dead soon,
he'd need years of psychiatric help.

604
00:43:37,827 --> 00:43:40,330
Let's do it tonight.

605
00:43:40,413 --> 00:43:45,502
The Rams will probably face Dallas
in the opening round. If they win...

606
00:43:45,584 --> 00:43:48,633
- Mr Pendleton.
- Hey!

607
00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:52,936
Am I glad to see you.
Line up any bodies yet?

608
00:43:53,009 --> 00:43:55,689
We haven't got a lot of time. If...

609
00:43:57,221 --> 00:43:59,440
I... The...

610
00:43:59,515 --> 00:44:02,149
...and only four measly field goals...

611
00:44:02,226 --> 00:44:04,646
Er, hi. I... I'm just...

612
00:44:28,002 --> 00:44:29,176
What's up?

613
00:44:29,253 --> 00:44:32,219
We have several
interesting probabilities.

614
00:44:32,298 --> 00:44:36,688
I kept my word to Betty Logan.
Did you find a body in good shape?

615
00:44:36,761 --> 00:44:38,647
I want to see some bodies.

616
00:44:40,556 --> 00:44:44,269
...someone who can throw.
The Super Bowl's coming up.

617
00:44:44,352 --> 00:44:47,151
You must have checked out
a lot of bodies...

618
00:44:48,564 --> 00:44:51,992
- Who is it?
- It's Sisk, sir.

619
00:44:53,027 --> 00:44:54,237
Come in, Sisk.

620
00:45:00,451 --> 00:45:05,172
Sorry to disturb you, Mr Farnsworth,
but Miss Betty Logan is downstairs

621
00:45:05,247 --> 00:45:09,174
and asks if she might have
a moment of your time.

622
00:45:11,629 --> 00:45:14,512
Er... Tell her I'll be right down.

623
00:45:14,590 --> 00:45:16,512
Very good, sir.

624
00:45:17,968 --> 00:45:21,895
Do you...? Do you wish
the door closed, sir?

625
00:45:21,972 --> 00:45:25,935
Er... closed is fine. Thank you.

626
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:35,664
Do your best.
I gotta find out what she wants.

627
00:45:47,039 --> 00:45:48,463
Hi.

628
00:45:51,377 --> 00:45:54,177
I don't know
what you must think of me

629
00:45:54,255 --> 00:45:57,352
after my behaviour
at our first meeting,

630
00:45:57,425 --> 00:46:01,980
but I feel I must tell you what an
extraordinary thing you did today.

631
00:46:02,054 --> 00:46:03,478
Quite extraordinary.

632
00:46:03,556 --> 00:46:05,561
- You don't have to say...
- No.

633
00:46:05,641 --> 00:46:08,061
- Because I...
- It's...

634
00:46:08,144 --> 00:46:12,450
You know what? You look a little
pale. You want something to eat?

635
00:46:12,690 --> 00:46:14,742
- Well...
- I'll be right back.

636
00:46:14,817 --> 00:46:17,367
Bentley. Everett.

637
00:46:17,445 --> 00:46:20,292
Miss Logan's going to
have dinner with us.

638
00:46:20,364 --> 00:46:23,045
Whip up a liver and whey shake.

639
00:46:23,325 --> 00:46:25,165
Where you going?

640
00:46:25,244 --> 00:46:26,667
Oh, I thought...

641
00:46:26,746 --> 00:46:31,669
You thought I meant to go out.
Sisk, we're going out. Come on.

642
00:46:31,751 --> 00:46:35,179
Bentley! Everett!
We're going out and eat. Good idea.

643
00:46:35,254 --> 00:46:37,176
Which hat would you prefer?

644
00:46:37,256 --> 00:46:40,186
Look, I don't want to wear a hat.

645
00:46:40,259 --> 00:46:44,186
I'm sick of hats.
Don't show me any more hats.

646
00:46:44,263 --> 00:46:47,941
- Understand?
- Yes, sir. No more hats.

647
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:05,753
It's...

648
00:47:09,455 --> 00:47:11,425
Do you eat here often?

649
00:47:13,709 --> 00:47:15,761
Are you...? Now, look...

650
00:47:18,631 --> 00:47:23,270
I just didn't think you'd want people
to see you out with a guy like me.

651
00:47:24,553 --> 00:47:26,144
I see.

652
00:47:43,364 --> 00:47:45,286
Pick up 24. Pick up 28.

653
00:47:45,366 --> 00:47:50,455
I'm sorry. I just can't stop
staring at you.

654
00:47:57,294 --> 00:47:59,798
I seem to be staring at you, too.

655
00:48:07,430 --> 00:48:11,273
Even when I was trying to hate you,
I saw something else.

656
00:48:12,351 --> 00:48:14,606
- Something...
- What?

657
00:48:14,687 --> 00:48:17,866
In your eyes. Does that sound silly?

658
00:48:22,069 --> 00:48:26,625
When you see that, it doesn't matter
who a person is or anything.

659
00:48:32,246 --> 00:48:33,800
What is it?

660
00:48:34,999 --> 00:48:38,546
This isn't what I thought
was going to happen to me.

661
00:48:42,798 --> 00:48:46,013
Listen, I got to talk
to somebody right away.

662
00:48:46,093 --> 00:48:48,857
Would you mind if I took you home?

663
00:48:57,229 --> 00:49:01,026
I... Good night.

664
00:49:01,108 --> 00:49:03,160
Good night.

665
00:49:05,571 --> 00:49:07,742
By the way, I'm getting a divorce.

666
00:49:07,823 --> 00:49:11,038
But you and your wife
aren't even separated.

667
00:49:11,118 --> 00:49:13,799
Oh, sure we are. It's a big house.

668
00:49:36,268 --> 00:49:40,195
- Hey! How you doing, Bentley?
- Fine, sir.

669
00:49:42,233 --> 00:49:47,619
- Mr Pendleton?
- Oh. Hi. Uh...

670
00:49:53,411 --> 00:49:56,341
I don't want that body
we talked about.

671
00:49:56,414 --> 00:49:58,383
Something happened tonight.

672
00:49:58,457 --> 00:49:59,715
This is an outrage.

673
00:49:59,792 --> 00:50:03,256
We've gone to enormous difficulty
to find an athlete.

674
00:50:03,337 --> 00:50:07,050
I did want it, but something happened
with Betty Logan

675
00:50:07,133 --> 00:50:08,972
and I changed my mind.

676
00:50:09,051 --> 00:50:11,103
I'll get Farnsworth into shape.

677
00:50:11,178 --> 00:50:14,227
I'll get Corkle to help me.

678
00:50:14,306 --> 00:50:16,442
- Back in there?
- Oh, yes.

679
00:50:16,517 --> 00:50:17,905
I can do it.

680
00:50:17,977 --> 00:50:21,239
I know more about getting
into shape than anybody.

681
00:50:21,313 --> 00:50:23,116
So hold up on that body.

682
00:50:23,190 --> 00:50:24,744
Hold up on the body?

683
00:50:24,817 --> 00:50:27,949
Tell Mr Jordan not to worry about it.
Thank him.

684
00:50:28,029 --> 00:50:31,208
I'm sorry, I want to get
into shape with this body.

685
00:50:31,282 --> 00:50:35,162
You leave me speechless.
I have nothing to say to that.

686
00:50:35,244 --> 00:50:37,498
I can't even think how to retort

687
00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:41,127
to something as ridiculous
as turning down a body

688
00:50:41,208 --> 00:50:43,545
we've gone to such extremes to find.

689
00:50:43,627 --> 00:50:47,009
An athlete in prime condition.
What can I say?

690
00:50:47,089 --> 00:50:49,391
What do I do with his cocoa?

691
00:50:49,467 --> 00:50:53,014
I don't want to disturb him,
but dare I let it get cold?

692
00:50:53,095 --> 00:50:55,017
I notice there are two cups.

693
00:50:55,097 --> 00:50:58,645
Sisk felt since he was pretending
to talk to somebody,

694
00:50:58,726 --> 00:51:01,739
he might want to pretend
to give him cocoa, too.

695
00:51:01,812 --> 00:51:03,023
Yes.

696
00:51:03,105 --> 00:51:08,455
Hey, how you doing, Everett?
How you doing, Bentley?

697
00:51:12,156 --> 00:51:13,497
Hurry UP-

698
00:51:13,574 --> 00:51:17,750
Wait a minute.
Just a minute, please. All right.

699
00:51:17,828 --> 00:51:23,001
Sorry to bother you, but we don't
love each other. Let's get divorced.

700
00:51:24,335 --> 00:51:26,589
I don't know
what you're talking about.

701
00:51:26,671 --> 00:51:28,094
Come on. Yes, you do.

702
00:51:28,172 --> 00:51:31,803
Abbott, there's a trainer
for the Rams named Max Corkle.

703
00:51:31,884 --> 00:51:35,266
Could you call and ask
him to come see me?

704
00:51:35,346 --> 00:51:37,102
Yes, Mr Farnsworth.

705
00:51:37,181 --> 00:51:39,649
Thank you. Good night.

706
00:51:39,725 --> 00:51:43,569
You idiot! You idiot!
Why did you answer him?

707
00:51:43,646 --> 00:51:46,493
I couldn't resist.
His will is too strong.

708
00:51:46,565 --> 00:51:50,955
That's our weekend forecast.
Now here's tonight's sports.

709
00:51:51,028 --> 00:51:53,080
Leach and Char will have to...

710
00:51:54,615 --> 00:51:57,415
He's dead. It's over with.

711
00:51:57,493 --> 00:52:00,458
...left for Philadelphia
this morning...

712
00:52:02,248 --> 00:52:03,754
At last, at last.

713
00:52:03,833 --> 00:52:06,882
- At last, my clearest.
- It's incredible.

714
00:52:11,048 --> 00:52:15,011
Yes! Just a minute. Yes!
Yes, Sisk.

715
00:52:15,094 --> 00:52:19,934
And, Abbott, Corkle's number
is 654-1654. All right?

716
00:52:20,016 --> 00:52:22,946
- Yes, Mr Farnsworth.
- OK.

717
00:52:23,019 --> 00:52:24,858
Oh, my God.

718
00:52:26,814 --> 00:52:28,866
Right this way.

719
00:52:28,941 --> 00:52:33,746
Mr Farnsworth is waiting for you
in the ballroom. Follow me, please.

720
00:52:41,871 --> 00:52:43,710
Mr Corkle, sir.

721
00:52:43,789 --> 00:52:46,672
Max. How you doing?

722
00:52:48,044 --> 00:52:49,681
Fine.

723
00:52:52,048 --> 00:52:54,266
Lost a little weight, huh?

724
00:52:55,843 --> 00:52:57,314
Have we met?

725
00:52:57,386 --> 00:52:58,774
Sort of. Yeah.

726
00:52:58,846 --> 00:53:01,527
Thanks, Sisk. Hey.

727
00:53:04,643 --> 00:53:08,107
I hear you got all Joe Pendleton's
athletic equipment.

728
00:53:08,189 --> 00:53:10,525
Yeah. How d'you know that?

729
00:53:10,608 --> 00:53:13,740
I'd like to buy it.
I'd like to bring it in here.

730
00:53:13,819 --> 00:53:17,782
No, I'm sorry, Mr Farnsworth.
That's not for sale.

731
00:53:17,865 --> 00:53:19,870
- No?
- What do you want it for?

732
00:53:19,950 --> 00:53:23,332
I've got to get in shape.
I'd like you to help me train.

733
00:53:23,412 --> 00:53:26,509
- Oh, train?
- Yeah. As soon as I'm ready...

734
00:53:29,251 --> 00:53:32,680
I want you to get me
a tryout with the Rams.

735
00:53:32,755 --> 00:53:35,009
What are you trying out for?

736
00:53:35,091 --> 00:53:36,930
Quarterback.

737
00:53:41,597 --> 00:53:44,611
Yeah, well, the point is,
Mr Farnsworth,

738
00:53:44,684 --> 00:53:48,030
we already got a quarterback
working with the team.

739
00:53:48,104 --> 00:53:50,572
We got a couple
of pretty good backups.

740
00:53:50,648 --> 00:53:53,116
You call Hodges good, huh?

741
00:53:53,192 --> 00:53:58,447
The point is
we don't need a quarterback.

742
00:53:58,531 --> 00:54:00,583
Why don't you try another team?

743
00:54:00,658 --> 00:54:03,707
The Oakland Raiders are close.
Give them a call.

744
00:54:03,786 --> 00:54:07,927
I want to play quarterback
and get in shape for the Super Bowl.

745
00:54:07,998 --> 00:54:10,004
What would it cost to try out?

746
00:54:10,084 --> 00:54:14,593
Look, Mr Farnsworth,
no team wants a crazy trainer,

747
00:54:14,672 --> 00:54:18,219
and only a crazy trainer
would arrange a tryout for you.

748
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:20,981
You keep your money,
I'll keep my job,

749
00:54:21,053 --> 00:54:24,897
and we'll keep this little
misunderstanding to ourselves.

750
00:54:24,974 --> 00:54:28,236
Hey, that's all right,
I'll finish that up.

751
00:54:28,310 --> 00:54:33,863
What would you say if I told you
I was a professional football player?

752
00:54:33,941 --> 00:54:37,405
Boy, hey, these... These are nice.

753
00:54:37,486 --> 00:54:40,868
Max... You know how people die?

754
00:54:40,948 --> 00:54:43,285
Yeah. Why?

755
00:54:44,326 --> 00:54:47,174
And after they die,
they go to heaven?

756
00:54:47,246 --> 00:54:51,387
I guess, if...if they're good.
I mean, why not?

757
00:54:52,835 --> 00:54:55,006
You know how it works in heaven?

758
00:54:55,087 --> 00:54:58,101
- Not exactly.
- It's probability and outcome.

759
00:55:01,552 --> 00:55:03,355
I never knew that.

760
00:55:03,429 --> 00:55:07,142
Say there's a probability
that some guy's going to die.

761
00:55:07,224 --> 00:55:09,858
An escort from his way station
gets a signal.

762
00:55:09,935 --> 00:55:13,115
He goes down
and waits for the outcome.

763
00:55:13,189 --> 00:55:15,906
If the guy lives,
the escort wasted a trip.

764
00:55:15,983 --> 00:55:19,365
If he dies, he takes him back
to his way station.

765
00:55:19,445 --> 00:55:23,158
He puts him in line for his
final destination. You follow?

766
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:24,664
Yeah. Mind if I smoke?

767
00:55:24,742 --> 00:55:29,167
Go ahead. Let's say there's
a new escort. He gets a signal.

768
00:55:29,246 --> 00:55:33,173
He takes off and sees a guy
riding a bicycle into a tunnel.

769
00:55:33,250 --> 00:55:37,343
The car's coming the other way.
The escort's supposed to wait,

770
00:55:37,421 --> 00:55:40,767
but he's new and figures
the guy's a goner.

771
00:55:40,841 --> 00:55:43,771
He figures, why should I
have the car hit him?

772
00:55:43,844 --> 00:55:46,941
Why not take him out
a few seconds early

773
00:55:47,014 --> 00:55:49,778
and take him up to his way station?

774
00:55:49,850 --> 00:55:52,568
Listen, l...need a match.

775
00:55:52,645 --> 00:55:54,531
That clock, that's a lighter.

776
00:55:54,605 --> 00:55:58,199
So the thing is, the guy he takes up
to the way station

777
00:55:58,275 --> 00:56:00,281
isn't just some ordinary guy.

778
00:56:00,361 --> 00:56:03,209
He's an athlete
with fantastic reflexes.

779
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:05,535
He wouldn't have hit
the car at all.

780
00:56:05,616 --> 00:56:08,416
- How do you light this?
- There.

781
00:56:08,494 --> 00:56:10,416
The guy wasn't really dead.

782
00:56:10,496 --> 00:56:14,339
His number wasn't up for years.
He would have missed the car.

783
00:56:14,417 --> 00:56:15,888
- No kidding?
- Yeah.

784
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:17,431
Is this lighter right?

785
00:56:17,503 --> 00:56:21,346
Max! They're supposed to put him
back in his body,

786
00:56:21,424 --> 00:56:23,345
but he's been cremated.

787
00:56:23,426 --> 00:56:27,732
- They have to find another body.
- Look, Mr Farnsworth,

788
00:56:27,805 --> 00:56:32,729
I'm just a trainer. What you need
is like a really good doctor.

789
00:56:32,810 --> 00:56:34,897
Don't you understand?

790
00:56:34,979 --> 00:56:37,233
Sure. That's a hell of a story.

791
00:56:37,314 --> 00:56:41,158
Max, you... Mr Jordan.
I'm so glad to see you.

792
00:56:41,235 --> 00:56:45,162
I'm trying to get Farnsworth
into shape for the Super Bowl.

793
00:56:45,239 --> 00:56:48,502
- I want Corkle to help me.
- Somebody with us?

794
00:56:48,576 --> 00:56:52,419
- Who are you talking to?
- Mr Jordan. He runs the way station.

795
00:56:52,496 --> 00:56:55,000
You can't see him.
You're still alive.

796
00:56:55,082 --> 00:56:58,713
You two probably got a lot
to talk about. I'll be on my way.

797
00:56:58,794 --> 00:57:02,140
- Wait a second, Max.
- Tell him who you are, Joe.

798
00:57:02,214 --> 00:57:05,014
He'll never believe me.
Can't you tell him?

799
00:57:05,092 --> 00:57:08,390
He's the only person who can get me
a tryout with the Rams.

800
00:57:08,471 --> 00:57:10,725
You can make him believe you.

801
00:57:10,806 --> 00:57:12,894
- Look at me.
- Mr Farnsworth...

802
00:57:12,975 --> 00:57:16,024
Max! I'm not Farnsworth.
I'm Joe Pendleton.

803
00:57:16,103 --> 00:57:19,236
Farnsworth's wife
and secretary murdered him.

804
00:57:19,315 --> 00:57:21,367
This is a body they found for me.

805
00:57:21,442 --> 00:57:25,036
They drugged him, stuck him
in a bath, then I stepped in.

806
00:57:25,112 --> 00:57:28,245
It's not bad material.
I can get it into shape.

807
00:57:28,324 --> 00:57:30,163
I don't want to hear any more.

808
00:57:30,242 --> 00:57:33,955
- Max, please.
- l...want to get out of here.

809
00:57:34,038 --> 00:57:36,458
- Max.
- I won't tell a word to anybody.

810
00:57:36,540 --> 00:57:39,008
I promise.
It'll be our little secret.

811
00:57:39,085 --> 00:57:43,261
A secret? Like your sister
and the Coca-Cola salesman?

812
00:57:44,965 --> 00:57:48,429
- What about the scar on your tongue?
- How did you...?

813
00:57:48,511 --> 00:57:51,275
What did you do
at your uncle's wedding?

814
00:57:51,347 --> 00:57:55,856
What about the first time
I fixed your neck in Pittsburgh?

815
00:57:59,438 --> 00:58:02,950
Now do you believe me, Max?
Please say you believe me.

816
00:58:03,025 --> 00:58:07,747
They don't have a team in heaven,
so God couldn't make me first-string.

817
00:58:07,822 --> 00:58:09,874
He doesn't believe me.

818
00:58:09,949 --> 00:58:13,745
Try a little music.
That's a great persuader.

819
00:58:26,257 --> 00:58:29,354
Joe, you never could play that thing.

820
00:58:34,598 --> 00:58:38,193
You all right, Max?
Max...you all right?

821
00:58:44,859 --> 00:58:48,205
Bentley! Whip up a liver and whey
shake right away!

822
00:58:51,198 --> 00:58:53,286
I'm gonna play in the Super Bowl.

823
00:58:53,367 --> 00:58:56,546
That's what I've got coming to me,
right, Mr Jordan?

824
00:58:56,620 --> 00:58:58,957
As you say.

825
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:01,210
- He's still here?
- Right there.

826
00:59:01,292 --> 00:59:04,554
Max, listen to me.
Farnsworth isn't in bad shape.

827
00:59:04,628 --> 00:59:08,639
I still know the moves.
Just help me with the body.

828
00:59:09,759 --> 00:59:10,886
Thanks, Mr Jordan.

829
00:59:14,221 --> 00:59:18,777
Sisk! How about that liver and
whey shake? Hurry up. Hurry up.

830
00:59:18,851 --> 00:59:22,149
- I need it for Mr Corkle.
- Yes, sir. Right away.

831
00:59:22,229 --> 00:59:26,192
I want the whole staff to suit up.
We're going into training.

832
00:59:32,198 --> 00:59:35,163
Listen, Mr...Jordan, is it?

833
00:59:38,621 --> 00:59:40,840
You still there?

834
00:59:42,333 --> 00:59:46,758
Any time you want to chime in...
why, just feel free.

835
00:59:46,837 --> 00:59:50,432
Feel free.
I'm telling you to feel free.

836
00:59:50,508 --> 00:59:53,355
You got to help me
talk Joe out of this.

837
00:59:53,427 --> 00:59:56,476
If I do get him a tryout,

838
00:59:56,555 --> 01:00:00,518
that team will put him
out of commission like that.

839
01:00:00,601 --> 01:00:05,358
Christ, I can't even snap
my fingers any more. Oh, sorry.

840
01:00:05,439 --> 01:00:09,865
He's not there, Max.
Don't get crazy. I'm counting on you.

841
01:00:52,486 --> 01:00:54,289
This isn't going to work.

842
01:01:00,536 --> 01:01:02,541
We're fooling with the Rams.

843
01:01:08,669 --> 01:01:10,970
It...it's just... Well, all right.

844
01:01:22,266 --> 01:01:25,030
I'm still figuring out
what I'll say. I...

845
01:01:44,288 --> 01:01:47,752
You're playing football
with a bunch of butlers.

846
01:01:47,833 --> 01:01:50,966
- This isn't gonna work!
- I fixed all that.

847
01:01:51,045 --> 01:01:54,224
- How?
- I bought the Rams.

848
01:01:56,550 --> 01:01:59,564
Leo Farnsworth has bought this team,

849
01:01:59,637 --> 01:02:02,057
and he wants to play quarterback.

850
01:02:02,139 --> 01:02:04,476
- Shit!
- Crazy son of a bitch.

851
01:02:04,558 --> 01:02:06,361
We won't take this bullshit.

852
01:02:06,435 --> 01:02:09,283
Wait a minute.
Fellas, this is the way it is.

853
01:02:09,355 --> 01:02:12,653
He'll play quarterback
in Wednesday's scrimmage.

854
01:02:12,733 --> 01:02:15,451
At which time,
he and the coach will decide

855
01:02:15,528 --> 01:02:18,375
whether he's qualified
for the job or not.

856
01:02:18,447 --> 01:02:21,959
Mr Farnsworth says,
"Tell no one to hold back“.

857
01:02:22,034 --> 01:02:26,294
These were his words, play that
scrimmage like the Super Bowl.

858
01:02:26,372 --> 01:02:29,172
- Take him at his word.
- Let's kill him.

859
01:02:32,003 --> 01:02:36,225
My team.
That son of a bitch got my team.

860
01:02:36,298 --> 01:02:39,098
What kind of pressure
did he use, Milt?

861
01:02:39,176 --> 01:02:44,563
Well, I asked for 67 million,
and he said OK.

862
01:02:45,850 --> 01:02:48,186
Ruthless bastard.

863
01:03:00,197 --> 01:03:04,208
We", very, very nice.
Very, Very, impressive.

864
01:03:04,285 --> 01:03:09,090
I'm Tony Abbott, Mr Farnsworth's
personal private executive secretary.

865
01:03:09,165 --> 01:03:11,170
Very nice. Very...very nice.

866
01:03:11,250 --> 01:03:15,971
Don't let any of Mr Farnsworth's
racial statements offend you.

867
01:03:19,216 --> 01:03:21,138
Nice talking to you.

868
01:03:23,763 --> 01:03:25,353
Come on, fellas.

869
01:03:49,872 --> 01:03:52,553
Get rid of that ball fast, all right?

870
01:03:52,625 --> 01:03:54,345
Good luck, Mr Farnsworth.

871
01:03:58,172 --> 01:04:01,850
Don't worry about the plays.
I got them down last night.

872
01:04:01,926 --> 01:04:05,354
- Yes, sir.
- I want to run a split right, X-go,

873
01:04:05,429 --> 01:04:08,312
Z-curl, a Y-straight.

874
01:04:08,391 --> 01:04:10,230
Like the Super Bowl. Break.

875
01:04:17,692 --> 01:04:20,277
Ready? Break.

876
01:04:20,361 --> 01:04:22,164
Tighten it up.

877
01:04:22,238 --> 01:04:25,417
Look at them.
That's how they look when they eat.

878
01:04:29,620 --> 01:04:31,210
Look out.

879
01:04:31,288 --> 01:04:32,712
4-3, set!

880
01:04:34,583 --> 01:04:35,876
2-85!

881
01:04:46,345 --> 01:04:48,267
Sorry, Mr Farnsworth.

882
01:04:52,518 --> 01:04:55,615
- Nice.
- Let's try it again, Mr Farnsworth.

883
01:04:58,482 --> 01:05:02,030
OK, get him back in there.
Let's go! Let's go!

884
01:05:02,111 --> 01:05:03,997
Try it with the ball!

885
01:05:04,071 --> 01:05:05,661
Come on, positions!

886
01:05:05,740 --> 01:05:07,827
Playing football is so much fun.

887
01:05:07,908 --> 01:05:09,201
Try this time.

888
01:05:09,285 --> 01:05:11,586
- Set!
- Come on now!

889
01:05:11,662 --> 01:05:13,252
2-81!

890
01:05:27,219 --> 01:05:31,442
I'm terribly sorry, Mr Farnsworth.
This is really embarrassing.

891
01:05:31,515 --> 01:05:34,730
Come on. Help him up.

892
01:05:34,810 --> 01:05:37,444
I guess you went offsides.

893
01:05:37,521 --> 01:05:40,736
Come on, guys, get him,
get him, get him.

894
01:05:40,816 --> 01:05:44,529
Give me a little more room, Billy.

895
01:05:44,612 --> 01:05:46,000
Se"

896
01:05:46,530 --> 01:05:49,295
Let's all try and stay onsides.

897
01:05:49,367 --> 01:05:50,957
2-85!

898
01:05:53,996 --> 01:05:56,215
- Better get a stretcher.
- Jesus!

899
01:05:56,290 --> 01:05:59,553
He's an eccentric.
We've always known that.

900
01:05:59,627 --> 01:06:02,841
Eccentric? Buying
a football team for 67 million

901
01:06:02,922 --> 01:06:05,258
- that has a book value of 19?
- Harry.

902
01:06:05,341 --> 01:06:08,271
Three weeks ago,
the stock was selling at 56.

903
01:06:08,344 --> 01:06:10,396
This morning it opened at 14.

904
01:06:10,471 --> 01:06:12,808
Go, 90, 9°-

905
01:06:12,890 --> 01:06:17,446
- You want a rest, Mr Farnsworth?
- No, no, it's OK.

906
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:23,202
Mr Farnsworth is taking the Rams to
the Super Bowl as their quarterback.

907
01:06:23,275 --> 01:06:25,993
No sign of aberration
in his behaviour?

908
01:06:26,070 --> 01:06:29,285
Nothing in his personal life
bothering him?

909
01:06:29,365 --> 01:06:31,536
That statement speaks for itself.

910
01:06:31,617 --> 01:06:35,164
All right, I'm going to save
you guys some trouble.

911
01:06:35,246 --> 01:06:38,508
Want me to quit?
Give me the ball once.

912
01:06:38,582 --> 01:06:40,967
If I don't hit Evans, I'll quit.

913
01:06:41,043 --> 01:06:42,597
- Ready?
- Break!

914
01:06:45,089 --> 01:06:47,059
Look out!

915
01:06:49,176 --> 01:06:50,600
Hey, now!

916
01:06:50,678 --> 01:06:52,481
On three!

917
01:06:52,555 --> 01:06:53,598
Se"

918
01:07:00,104 --> 01:07:01,907
Beautiful!

919
01:07:03,399 --> 01:07:06,282
There's a potential there! He's...

920
01:07:08,863 --> 01:07:10,702
- OK.
- Take it easy.

921
01:07:10,781 --> 01:07:11,873
I know.

922
01:07:11,949 --> 01:07:16,172
- Shit, man, what you doing?
- What's he doing?

923
01:07:16,245 --> 01:07:17,586
Ready? Break.

924
01:07:18,414 --> 01:07:21,131
Red right, red right. Watch the pass.

925
01:07:21,208 --> 01:07:24,008
4-3. Set! 3!

926
01:07:31,177 --> 01:07:32,387
Not bad.

927
01:07:34,930 --> 01:07:36,484
1-81!

928
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:42,908
Jesus.

929
01:07:44,190 --> 01:07:46,776
I think we got us
a rich quarterback.

930
01:08:02,208 --> 01:08:04,213
He's looking awful good.

931
01:08:11,384 --> 01:08:13,720
Boy, you pulled it off.

932
01:08:13,803 --> 01:08:17,765
Yeah? I don't know.
I think I can do it.

933
01:08:19,058 --> 01:08:21,988
Hey, Mr Farnsworth,
play any college ball?

934
01:08:22,061 --> 01:08:24,446
No. I played a little polo.

935
01:08:33,364 --> 01:08:34,918
Look, look.

936
01:08:34,990 --> 01:08:36,746
He brought the whole team.

937
01:08:36,826 --> 01:08:39,162
That's not a football team.

938
01:08:39,245 --> 01:08:41,879
There are old men
and skinny younger men.

939
01:08:41,956 --> 01:08:43,213
Look at the women.

940
01:08:43,290 --> 01:08:46,470
That's the ecology group
Exo-Grey is funding.

941
01:08:46,544 --> 01:08:50,008
He's getting ready to spring a trap.
This whole thing.

942
01:08:50,089 --> 01:08:53,720
The football team gag,
the ecology crap, the divorce...

943
01:08:53,801 --> 01:08:57,977
The only thing he has not announced
is our divorce and when he does,

944
01:08:58,055 --> 01:09:00,938
I'll be the first suspect
when we kill him.

945
01:09:01,017 --> 01:09:05,821
Darling, perhaps I'm being silly,
but I'd be more comfortable...

946
01:09:05,896 --> 01:09:08,482
Have I offended you in some way?

947
01:09:09,817 --> 01:09:12,700
Don't put your hand
over my mouth again.

948
01:09:12,862 --> 01:09:14,831
- You used to like it.
- Listen,

949
01:09:14,905 --> 01:09:17,041
if we don't act now, we'll lose it.

950
01:09:17,116 --> 01:09:20,497
I was mad to sign a prenuptial
agreement.

951
01:09:20,578 --> 01:09:23,259
I'll get an allowance.
You'll be fired.

952
01:09:23,330 --> 01:09:26,178
- We'll have each other.
- Not after he brings charges...

953
01:09:26,250 --> 01:09:27,258
Don't!

954
01:11:14,608 --> 01:11:16,578
Is it?

955
01:11:20,281 --> 01:11:22,368
Want to make a wish?

956
01:11:23,117 --> 01:11:27,791
- Yes.
- All right. There.

957
01:11:27,872 --> 01:11:29,165
Go ahead.

958
01:11:30,958 --> 01:11:32,346
Very good.

959
01:11:44,805 --> 01:11:49,195
Tell me, do you think it's silly,
me trying to be a football player?

960
01:11:49,268 --> 01:11:51,522
Of course not. That's what you want.

961
01:11:51,604 --> 01:11:53,905
You think I can do it?

962
01:11:53,981 --> 01:11:56,698
I think you could do
anything you wanted.

963
01:11:56,776 --> 01:12:00,204
Anything you committed yourself
to do, you could do.

964
01:12:01,197 --> 01:12:03,996
Because I'm a big wheel
at Exo-Grey?

965
01:12:04,075 --> 01:12:09,247
- You're not afraid of things.
- Afraid of things? Why would I be?

966
01:12:09,330 --> 01:12:14,170
Well, you know, most people are
afraid of something, aren't they?

967
01:12:14,251 --> 01:12:18,214
You want to know
the only thing I'm afraid of?

968
01:12:22,134 --> 01:12:25,267
How I'd feel
if I couldn't be with you.

969
01:12:27,556 --> 01:12:30,938
Then there's nothing
to be afraid of, is there?

970
01:12:32,645 --> 01:12:33,986
Got to go.

971
01:12:34,063 --> 01:12:36,946
Wait a minute. I'd...

972
01:12:37,024 --> 01:12:40,370
How would you feel about marrying me?

973
01:12:46,617 --> 01:12:48,171
It's crazy?

974
01:12:49,161 --> 01:12:51,842
No, it doesn't sound crazy.

975
01:12:51,914 --> 01:12:54,382
You know, if I...

976
01:12:54,458 --> 01:12:57,887
What is it? What is it?

977
01:12:57,962 --> 01:13:01,059
Could you wait here?
I'll be right back.

978
01:13:10,182 --> 01:13:11,689
What do you want?

979
01:13:11,767 --> 01:13:13,440
I'm sorry, Mr Pendleton,

980
01:13:13,519 --> 01:13:17,232
you won't be able to use
Mr Farnsworth's body any longer.

981
01:13:17,314 --> 01:13:20,114
What are you talking about?

982
01:13:20,192 --> 01:13:23,241
Just what I said.
Your time is up. You don't fit.

983
01:13:23,320 --> 01:13:25,408
You said I'd get to the Super Bowl.

984
01:13:25,489 --> 01:13:30,080
Whatever you do, it won't be
with Mr Farnsworth's body.

985
01:13:31,328 --> 01:13:33,914
- Why not?
- It wasn't meant to be.

986
01:13:33,998 --> 01:13:36,715
" Why not?
' S'°P saying that!

987
01:13:36,792 --> 01:13:38,762
I won't keep paying for your mistake.

988
01:13:38,836 --> 01:13:42,134
- Look, Mr Pendleton...
- I'm not talking to you.

989
01:13:42,214 --> 01:13:44,895
Tell Mr Jordan
I'd like to talk to him.

990
01:13:44,967 --> 01:13:49,855
We'll settle this once and for all.
Get out of here. You're bad news.

991
01:13:57,188 --> 01:14:00,118
- Is something wrong?
- No, it's...

992
01:14:00,191 --> 01:14:03,240
I just got to straighten
something out.

993
01:14:03,319 --> 01:14:05,538
Maybe I better walk you to the car.

994
01:14:22,546 --> 01:14:25,097
Something is wrong, isn't it?

995
01:14:25,174 --> 01:14:27,475
- I was just thinking, Betty.
- What?

996
01:14:27,551 --> 01:14:31,264
We got a great life ahead,
you and me,

997
01:14:31,347 --> 01:14:35,024
and nobody's going
to take that away from us.

998
01:14:35,101 --> 01:14:37,900
Why are you looking at me like that?

999
01:14:37,978 --> 01:14:42,201
I'm memorising your face. I want
to memorise everything about you

1000
01:14:42,274 --> 01:14:45,204
so no matter what happens,
I won't forget you.

1001
01:14:45,277 --> 01:14:49,121
- What's going to happen?
- Nothing's going to happen.

1002
01:14:50,241 --> 01:14:53,290
You'd never forget me either,
would you?

1003
01:14:53,369 --> 01:14:55,504
- No.
- That thing you said you saw in me.

1004
01:14:55,579 --> 01:14:58,213
It was something in my eyes.
Remember?

1005
01:14:58,290 --> 01:15:02,052
If some clay somebody came up to you,
maybe a football player,

1006
01:15:02,128 --> 01:15:04,631
and he acted like
he'd seen you before,

1007
01:15:04,714 --> 01:15:07,182
you'd notice that same thing, right?

1008
01:15:07,258 --> 01:15:10,188
You'd give him a chance?
He might be a good guy.

1009
01:15:10,261 --> 01:15:14,484
- He could even be a quarterback.
- I don't understand.

1010
01:15:15,558 --> 01:15:17,527
I'm just acting crazy.

1011
01:15:21,772 --> 01:15:23,113
Betty?

1012
01:15:37,204 --> 01:15:41,345
It's all right.
There's nothing to be afraid of.

1013
01:16:18,496 --> 01:16:20,667
You must abide by what is written.

1014
01:16:20,748 --> 01:16:22,302
Why?

1015
01:16:22,375 --> 01:16:26,598
There's a reason for everything.
There's always a plan.

1016
01:16:26,671 --> 01:16:30,017
- How can I give up Farnsworth now?
- I'm sorry, Joe.

1017
01:16:30,091 --> 01:16:31,847
You said we'd get to the Super Bowl.

1018
01:16:31,926 --> 01:16:34,097
Yes, if it's meant to be.

1019
01:16:34,178 --> 01:16:36,148
- I'm not leaving.
- Sorry.

1020
01:16:36,222 --> 01:16:38,642
- I'm not leaving, Mr Jordan.
- Joe,

1021
01:16:38,724 --> 01:16:41,488
you asked
for a temporary arrangement.

1022
01:16:41,560 --> 01:16:45,701
I never went back on a deal,
but I am now. I'm not going.

1023
01:16:45,773 --> 01:16:50,163
Your destiny is not in my hands.
Please don't make it more difficult.

1024
01:16:50,236 --> 01:16:53,083
I won't. I'm just not going to do it.

1025
01:16:53,155 --> 01:16:56,370
Joe, you must abide
by what is written.

1026
01:16:56,450 --> 01:16:58,918
She loves me, Mr Jordan.

1027
01:16:58,994 --> 01:17:01,878
Joe, you must abide
by what is written.

1028
01:17:45,791 --> 01:17:49,754
Don't be afraid, Joe. There is
a plan. There's always a plan.

1029
01:18:00,139 --> 01:18:02,903
Bentley, have you seen
Mr Farnsworth?

1030
01:18:02,975 --> 01:18:04,696
No, sir, I haven't.

1031
01:18:04,769 --> 01:18:08,280
- Guess I'll just keep looking.
- Yes, sir.

1032
01:18:11,484 --> 01:18:13,820
Joe, you in here?

1033
01:18:20,368 --> 01:18:22,503
Are you in there, Mr Farnsworth?

1034
01:18:36,592 --> 01:18:38,478
Yes.

1035
01:18:38,552 --> 01:18:39,763
Yes!

1036
01:18:39,845 --> 01:18:44,520
Listen, Your Highness, I'm telling
you what I told the Mayor last week.

1037
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:47,779
By the end of the week,
I'll crack this case.

1038
01:18:47,853 --> 01:18:50,321
Right. Another Arab.

1039
01:18:50,398 --> 01:18:53,826
Son of a bitch Farnsworth
was into everything,

1040
01:18:53,901 --> 01:18:56,784
and now he's vanished, disappeared.

1041
01:18:56,862 --> 01:19:00,160
This is the craziest nut
I've ever had to deal with.

1042
01:19:00,241 --> 01:19:03,871
He wasn't fooling around.
If he was alive, he'd be here.

1043
01:19:03,953 --> 01:19:08,176
You're asking me to believe Leo
Farnsworth asked you to marry him?

1044
01:19:08,249 --> 01:19:10,336
Yes. He was going to get a divorce.

1045
01:19:10,418 --> 01:19:14,179
When I left, he said he'd call me,
but something happened.

1046
01:19:14,255 --> 01:19:17,387
- How do you know?
- Because he didn't call me.

1047
01:19:17,466 --> 01:19:19,518
He would have kept his word.

1048
01:19:21,595 --> 01:19:24,858
With less than 24 hours
before the big game,

1049
01:19:24,932 --> 01:19:28,563
the whereabouts of Leo Farnsworth
remains a mystery.

1050
01:19:28,644 --> 01:19:32,820
Farnsworth said his wife and
Tony Abbott were trying to kill him.

1051
01:19:32,898 --> 01:19:35,746
Let me spring it on Abbott,

1052
01:19:35,818 --> 01:19:37,574
I can make him crack.

1053
01:19:37,653 --> 01:19:41,580
OK. Take Corkle
to the Farnsworth house.

1054
01:19:41,657 --> 01:19:43,080
The game.

1055
01:19:48,622 --> 01:19:54,009
If you win this one, you're going
to be champions of the world.

1056
01:19:54,086 --> 01:19:57,883
And they can take away
the money and the cheers.

1057
01:19:57,965 --> 01:20:01,643
They can take away the good looks,

1058
01:20:03,137 --> 01:20:06,020
but nobody will ever
take that away from you.

1059
01:20:11,854 --> 01:20:13,147
Let's go.

1060
01:20:19,820 --> 01:20:21,623
Let me get this straight.

1061
01:20:21,697 --> 01:20:26,419
You're saying you saw no specific
changes in Mr Farnsworth's behaviour?

1062
01:20:26,494 --> 01:20:30,883
No, sir. A bit more talkative,
but other than that, normal.

1063
01:20:30,956 --> 01:20:34,089
And that's your opinion, too,
Mr Sisk?

1064
01:20:34,168 --> 01:20:39,423
Yes. I did notice he seemed
to take a dislike to his hats,

1065
01:20:39,507 --> 01:20:41,227
but it was never violent.

1066
01:20:41,300 --> 01:20:44,682
Why don't you ask me
whatever you want and...?

1067
01:20:44,762 --> 01:20:46,767
Mr Corkle, please. Mr Everett?

1068
01:20:46,847 --> 01:20:48,852
Oh. Y-y-yes?

1069
01:20:48,933 --> 01:20:52,112
- You had cocoa with him every night.
- Uh, yes.

1070
01:20:52,186 --> 01:20:54,108
What did you talk about?

1071
01:20:54,188 --> 01:20:56,738
Well, he'd say something like,

1072
01:20:56,816 --> 01:21:05,334
"This cocoa is good, isn't it?“
And I'd say, “Yes, it is.“

1073
01:21:05,408 --> 01:21:08,456
And then he'd say something like,

1074
01:21:08,536 --> 01:21:11,335
"I wish the marshmallow
would last longer.“

1075
01:21:11,414 --> 01:21:15,673
And I'd say, “So do l.“

1076
01:21:15,751 --> 01:21:19,097
Sometimes he talked about cookies.

1077
01:21:20,381 --> 01:21:21,935
Thank you, Mr Everett.

1078
01:21:22,008 --> 01:21:24,476
Did he mention disliking his hats?

1079
01:21:24,552 --> 01:21:27,814
What the hell is this?
What does it matter?

1080
01:21:27,888 --> 01:21:29,976
I'm following a line of questioning.

1081
01:21:30,057 --> 01:21:35,775
Please. Mr Everett, did he ever
say anything to you about his hats?

1082
01:21:35,855 --> 01:21:39,069
- Never, sir.
- Thank you, Mr Everett.

1083
01:21:50,786 --> 01:21:55,342
Mr Abbott, what did you discuss
the last time you saw him?

1084
01:21:55,416 --> 01:21:58,002
He was considering buying Haiti.

1085
01:21:58,085 --> 01:21:59,758
- The country?
- Yes, sir.

1086
01:22:03,090 --> 01:22:07,101
Thank you, Mr Abbott.
Nothing about hats?

1087
01:22:07,470 --> 01:22:08,893
No.

1088
01:22:08,971 --> 01:22:10,774
Thank you, Mr Abbott.

1089
01:22:10,848 --> 01:22:14,810
Mrs Farnsworth, how was your
relationship with your husband?

1090
01:22:14,894 --> 01:22:17,907
Very, very close. Very, very special.

1091
01:22:17,980 --> 01:22:21,860
Miss Logan claims
he was getting a divorce

1092
01:22:21,942 --> 01:22:24,908
and he asked her to marry him.

1093
01:22:24,987 --> 01:22:27,123
I don't doubt that.

1094
01:22:27,198 --> 01:22:30,994
My husband loved me very, very much,
but he was a man.

1095
01:22:31,077 --> 01:22:32,998
He would say or do anything

1096
01:22:33,079 --> 01:22:37,041
to make a conquest,
but it never touched our marriage.

1097
01:22:37,124 --> 01:22:39,212
That's what made it so special.

1098
01:22:39,293 --> 01:22:41,215
They're pinning it on Betty.

1099
01:22:41,295 --> 01:22:45,518
Miss Logan, I am sorry if I've said
anything that's hurt you.

1100
01:22:45,591 --> 01:22:49,601
That's all right, I don't know you
well enough for you to hurt me.

1101
01:22:49,679 --> 01:22:54,768
- I hope you don't doubt my word.
- I don't, I'm sure you're lying.

1102
01:22:55,893 --> 01:22:57,945
I assume if Mr Farnsworth told you

1103
01:22:58,020 --> 01:23:00,986
about disliking his hats,
you'd let us know.

1104
01:23:01,065 --> 01:23:03,782
You want to know about his hats?

1105
01:23:03,859 --> 01:23:06,030
He wouldn't wear socks with a suit!

1106
01:23:06,112 --> 01:23:10,371
Every time he crossed his legs,
you could see his ankles were bare!

1107
01:23:10,449 --> 01:23:12,786
That's when he stopped wearing hats.

1108
01:23:12,868 --> 01:23:14,755
They looked funny without socks!

1109
01:23:14,829 --> 01:23:17,926
But he never told you
he disliked them.

1110
01:23:17,998 --> 01:23:19,754
- What?
- His hats.

1111
01:23:19,834 --> 01:23:23,215
Are you crazy? What kind
of questions are you asking?

1112
01:23:23,295 --> 01:23:26,558
All right. Sit down.
Conway, turn that thing on.

1113
01:23:26,632 --> 01:23:28,222
Let him watch the game.

1114
01:23:28,300 --> 01:23:30,103
Everything will be all right.

1115
01:23:30,177 --> 01:23:34,400
We're getting a clearer picture
of Mr Farnsworth's patterns.

1116
01:23:34,473 --> 01:23:37,771
There's a reason for everything.
There's got to be.

1117
01:23:37,852 --> 01:23:40,071
It's a demanding defence.

1118
01:23:40,146 --> 01:23:42,482
You don't need to worry about her.

1119
01:23:42,565 --> 01:23:46,077
Tom Jarrett, the Rams' quarterback,
back to pass.

1120
01:23:46,152 --> 01:23:49,035
Looking, scrambling. He's in trouble.

1121
01:23:49,113 --> 01:23:51,450
And he's hit hard! Down he goes!

1122
01:23:57,913 --> 01:24:00,084
What you're telling me, Mr Abbott,

1123
01:24:00,166 --> 01:24:03,096
is that Mr Farnsworth
never carried any money

1124
01:24:03,169 --> 01:24:05,803
or credit cards, right?

1125
01:24:05,880 --> 01:24:07,849
And no identification papers?

1126
01:24:07,923 --> 01:24:11,138
- Right, sir. Yes.
- Then what we have here...

1127
01:24:11,218 --> 01:24:15,145
The score, 24-24. Overtime.

1128
01:24:15,222 --> 01:24:18,520
The way he was hit,
Tom Jarrett is hurt.

1129
01:24:18,601 --> 01:24:24,864
The Ram players are concerned and
they're calling for the stretcher.

1130
01:24:24,940 --> 01:24:26,447
Jarrett has not moved.

1131
01:24:26,525 --> 01:24:30,369
It'll be a miracle, frankly,
and I hope he's well.

1132
01:24:30,446 --> 01:24:31,703
He really got hit.

1133
01:24:31,781 --> 01:24:36,420
Now they order Jerry Hodges to start
warming up on the sidelines.

1134
01:24:36,494 --> 01:24:39,377
The Pittsburgh defence
has been brilliant.

1135
01:24:39,455 --> 01:24:41,425
They've stopped the Rams...

1136
01:24:41,499 --> 01:24:43,967
The Haitian ambassador's here.

1137
01:24:44,043 --> 01:24:46,593
Oh, yes. Yes, thank you, Sisk.

1138
01:24:46,671 --> 01:24:48,261
Tell him to wait.

1139
01:24:49,799 --> 01:24:51,555
Who do you think you are?

1140
01:24:51,634 --> 01:24:55,857
- You call this an investigation!
- Now!

1141
01:24:55,930 --> 01:24:58,433
- Standing around...
- How'd you do it?

1142
01:24:58,516 --> 01:25:01,814
Did you drug him like you did before?

1143
01:25:01,894 --> 01:25:05,073
This one has seesawed back and forth.

1144
01:25:05,147 --> 01:25:08,944
Lieutenant, I will not be spoken to
in this way in my house.

1145
01:25:19,704 --> 01:25:23,761
- Why did it have to be Jarrett?
- Because it's his time, Joe.

1146
01:25:23,833 --> 01:25:26,052
It's his destiny.

1147
01:25:38,389 --> 01:25:40,109
Look at the pupils!

1148
01:25:40,182 --> 01:25:42,270
Bill! Get that ambulance!

1149
01:26:05,249 --> 01:26:08,097
Jarrett's coming back into the game.

1150
01:26:13,215 --> 01:26:15,018
Oh, my God! It's his jacket!

1151
01:26:16,635 --> 01:26:18,438
So it's you, Mr Abbott!

1152
01:26:18,512 --> 01:26:21,193
I should have known
I couldn't trust you.

1153
01:26:21,265 --> 01:26:24,148
- Here's your murderer!
- She did it!

1154
01:26:24,226 --> 01:26:27,026
I'll sign a confession
that she did it!

1155
01:26:27,104 --> 01:26:29,441
She's been planning it for years!

1156
01:26:29,523 --> 01:26:33,118
- Corkle, where are you going?
- To the Coliseum.

1157
01:26:33,194 --> 01:26:36,456
- I'm conducting an investigation.
- I'm going.

1158
01:26:36,530 --> 01:26:39,828
Take this investigation
and shove it up your ass!

1159
01:26:41,369 --> 01:26:43,006
3-23.

1160
01:26:56,300 --> 01:27:00,144
It's sudden death!
This crowd's delirious!'

1161
01:27:15,069 --> 01:27:19,245
Jarrett was sacked hard.
He's getting up. He's OK.

1162
01:27:39,176 --> 01:27:41,347
2-85!

1163
01:27:52,314 --> 01:27:54,948
A remarkable comeback by Jarrett.

1164
01:27:55,026 --> 01:27:57,078
The first team that scores wins.

1165
01:28:07,079 --> 01:28:08,716
Se"

1166
01:28:10,041 --> 01:28:11,251
2...

1167
01:28:49,288 --> 01:28:50,499
All right!

1168
01:28:50,581 --> 01:28:53,167
We're number one! We're number one!

1169
01:29:06,222 --> 01:29:07,812
We did it!

1170
01:29:12,728 --> 01:29:13,939
Hi, Max.

1171
01:29:14,021 --> 01:29:16,869
I am right, it is you, isn't it?

1172
01:29:16,941 --> 01:29:18,068
Yeah.

1173
01:29:21,028 --> 01:29:23,496
I knew it! I knew it!

1174
01:29:24,865 --> 01:29:29,670
I was watching the TV,
and I said, “That's him!“

1175
01:29:29,745 --> 01:29:31,466
The Rams are champions!

1176
01:29:31,539 --> 01:29:35,596
Here's the star, Tom Jarrett.
He led his team to victory.

1177
01:29:35,668 --> 01:29:38,088
- How do you feel?
- Good.

1178
01:29:38,170 --> 01:29:40,756
I mean, can you describe
your feelings?

1179
01:29:40,840 --> 01:29:43,937
- World champions!
- I... I feel good.

1180
01:29:44,010 --> 01:29:45,267
Please, please.

1181
01:29:45,344 --> 01:29:48,476
I have to go now, Joe. It's time.

1182
01:29:48,556 --> 01:29:50,976
I can't stay here any longer.

1183
01:29:51,058 --> 01:29:54,938
- What do you mean?
- How does it feel to be Tom Jarrett?

1184
01:29:55,021 --> 01:29:57,951
And when I've gone,
you won't remember me.

1185
01:29:58,024 --> 01:30:01,785
You'll be Thomas Jarrett
with no memory of Joe Pendleton

1186
01:30:01,861 --> 01:30:05,455
or Leo Farnsworth
or anything that's happened.

1187
01:30:05,531 --> 01:30:09,790
This is your destiny, Joe.
You're back on your own road now.

1188
01:30:09,869 --> 01:30:12,253
What do you mean, I won't remember?

1189
01:30:12,329 --> 01:30:15,010
Goodbye, Joe.

1190
01:30:15,082 --> 01:30:17,337
There's a lot of confusion.

1191
01:30:17,418 --> 01:30:20,383
Wait. I got to talk to you. Wait.

1192
01:30:20,463 --> 01:30:22,931
Goodbye.

1193
01:30:23,007 --> 01:30:25,593
Congratulations.
Here he is, Coach...

1194
01:30:25,676 --> 01:30:28,013
You OK, Tom? You OK?

1195
01:30:28,095 --> 01:30:32,983
Here's Lamar Crawford, the man
who caught one of those key passes.

1196
01:30:33,059 --> 01:30:35,527
I'm just happy that we won.

1197
01:30:51,035 --> 01:30:55,507
In September, I told you
the beginning of this season!

1198
01:30:55,581 --> 01:30:59,342
Hey, Benny!
Hey, Joe! Uh, Tom!

1199
01:30:59,418 --> 01:31:04,342
- Hey, Doc. Did Tom leave?
- He's putting some ice on his eye.

1200
01:31:04,423 --> 01:31:08,646
He'll be all right.
That's something about Farnsworth.

1201
01:31:08,719 --> 01:31:11,982
- Poor son of a bitch.
- Yeah...

1202
01:31:28,572 --> 01:31:33,163
Hey. Corkle. What are you doing,
closing up the joint?

1203
01:31:33,244 --> 01:31:36,174
I didn't know you played that thing.

1204
01:31:36,247 --> 01:31:40,553
- What are you talking about?
- Hmm? Is that yours?

1205
01:31:40,626 --> 01:31:42,927
What are you talking about?

1206
01:31:43,004 --> 01:31:46,302
- What do you mean?
- You know what I mean.

1207
01:31:46,382 --> 01:31:49,347
I mean, what are you
talking about, Joe?

1208
01:31:54,140 --> 01:31:55,730
Am I missing something?

1209
01:31:57,852 --> 01:32:01,909
Come on. What are you
trying to do to me, huh?

1210
01:32:01,981 --> 01:32:05,362
Hey, I'm the guy
that got hit in the head.

1211
01:32:05,443 --> 01:32:07,578
You sure you're all right, Corkle?

1212
01:32:09,155 --> 01:32:12,868
Hey, play something
for me on this thing, huh?

1213
01:32:14,493 --> 01:32:17,376
That's the way it is
with champagne, huh?

1214
01:32:17,455 --> 01:32:22,010
You just keep swallowing it
cos it doesn't taste like anything,

1215
01:32:22,084 --> 01:32:25,050
and all of a sudden, you're drunk.

1216
01:32:33,304 --> 01:32:37,266
You going to the party, Corkle?
I'll give you a ride.

1217
01:32:45,316 --> 01:32:47,285
Hey, you...

1218
01:32:48,652 --> 01:32:51,037
A little fresh air wouldn't hurt.

1219
01:32:53,449 --> 01:32:58,088
Hey, look. Just do me one favour.
Look at me.

1220
01:32:58,162 --> 01:33:01,211
Just...just... Just look at me.

1221
01:33:02,291 --> 01:33:03,928
What?

1222
01:33:29,568 --> 01:33:33,199
You want to tell me why
you're calling me Joe?

1223
01:33:37,368 --> 01:33:40,417
I guess it has
something to do with...

1224
01:33:40,496 --> 01:33:41,884
Joe Pendleton.

1225
01:33:47,420 --> 01:33:49,341
Hey, uh...

1226
01:33:49,422 --> 01:33:52,470
I'm sorry. I didn't think, Corkle.

1227
01:33:58,014 --> 01:34:00,564
You sure you don't want a ride?

1228
01:34:00,641 --> 01:34:05,363
No, I'll just... I'm going
to sit here for a minute.

1229
01:34:07,940 --> 01:34:11,701
Hey, son, you...
You played a hell of a game.

1230
01:34:11,777 --> 01:34:15,657
Oh, thanks, Corkle. You all right?

1231
01:34:15,740 --> 01:34:19,086
Yeah. Yeah.

1232
01:34:19,160 --> 01:34:20,548
OK.

1233
01:34:52,109 --> 01:34:56,072
Oh, excuse me.
Where might I find Max Corkle?

1234
01:34:56,155 --> 01:35:00,117
- I believe he's here somewhere.
- He's in the locker room.

1235
01:35:00,201 --> 01:35:02,704
Go back up there the way you came

1236
01:35:02,787 --> 01:35:06,334
or go back and take a right
and then a left.

1237
01:35:06,415 --> 01:35:11,137
- It's the second door on the right.
- I see. Thank you.

1238
01:35:11,212 --> 01:35:12,600
Thank you.

1239
01:35:19,428 --> 01:35:23,900
He's not expecting me.
Is it all right if I just walk in?

1240
01:35:23,974 --> 01:35:26,359
Sure. He's the only guy in there.

1241
01:35:32,483 --> 01:35:33,906
Have we met?

1242
01:35:33,984 --> 01:35:37,448
No. I don't think so.

1243
01:35:37,530 --> 01:35:42,204
No, I guess we haven't. I'm sorry.

1244
01:35:43,369 --> 01:35:45,291
What did you think of the game?

1245
01:35:45,371 --> 01:35:47,423
L...l didn't see it.

1246
01:35:49,792 --> 01:35:51,512
Does your eye hurt?

1247
01:35:51,585 --> 01:35:55,216
No, no, I...
Listen, my name's Tom Jarrett.

1248
01:35:55,297 --> 01:35:58,892
- Hello. I'm Betty Logan.
- Yeah. It's nice to meet you.

1249
01:36:00,052 --> 01:36:04,359
- You must play for the Rams.
- Yeah. You interested in football?

1250
01:36:05,933 --> 01:36:07,855
A friend of mine was.

1251
01:36:07,935 --> 01:36:10,106
Was?

1252
01:36:10,187 --> 01:36:12,109
Leo Farnsworth.

1253
01:36:13,691 --> 01:36:16,740
I'm sorry. Was he a close friend?

1254
01:36:16,819 --> 01:36:19,453
Yes, he was very close.

1255
01:36:21,032 --> 01:36:25,421
- Oh, that's too bad. I'm sorry.
- Have you put some ice on that?

1256
01:36:28,956 --> 01:36:32,338
- What's that?
- They're just closing up the place.

1257
01:36:32,418 --> 01:36:34,388
Here, give me your hand.

1258
01:36:36,756 --> 01:36:39,935
It's all right.
There's nothing to be afraid of.

1259
01:36:44,388 --> 01:36:48,481
- You can...
- What did you say?

1260
01:36:48,559 --> 01:36:50,529
What?

1261
01:36:52,355 --> 01:36:56,116
Just then, when you said,
there's nothing to be afraid of.

1262
01:36:56,192 --> 01:36:58,244
Your voice sounded so familiar.

1263
01:36:58,319 --> 01:37:03,456
Yeah? Well, like I said,
I thought I knew you, too.

1264
01:37:06,035 --> 01:37:09,132
People always think
they knew somebody before.

1265
01:37:09,205 --> 01:37:11,708
Yes, they do.

1266
01:37:14,752 --> 01:37:17,089
I was going to meet
a bunch of people.

1267
01:37:17,171 --> 01:37:19,472
We're having a big party

1268
01:37:19,548 --> 01:37:22,016
- and I'm a little late.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

1269
01:37:22,093 --> 01:37:24,394
0h, n0, no, no.

1270
01:37:24,470 --> 01:37:27,649
All of a sudden,
I don't feel like going to a party,

1271
01:37:27,723 --> 01:37:31,780
and...and I thought maybe if...

1272
01:37:31,852 --> 01:37:34,189
I mean...

1273
01:37:35,272 --> 01:37:38,156
You want to have a cup of coffee
or something?

1274
01:37:45,491 --> 01:37:47,662
Well, I guess not.

1275
01:37:52,456 --> 01:37:54,046
You're the quarterback.

1276
01:37:55,876 --> 01:37:59,009
Yeah. How'd you know that?

1277
01:38:03,426 --> 01:38:07,306
Yes, I'd love to have
a cup of coffee with you.

1278
01:40:07,466 --> 01:40:09,637
