1
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:07,810
(Episode 29)

2
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,220
We played you for fun.

3
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,320
Why...

4
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:26,089
Why did you do this to me?

5
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:29,059
That's the wrong question.

6
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,100
We don't have a special reason
when we pick out our toy.

7
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,929
You should ask why we chose...

8
00:00:34,429 --> 00:00:37,239
the scholarship student,
Eun Tae Hee.

9
00:00:39,469 --> 00:00:42,409
It's because as it so happens,
you're Ki Young's first love.

10
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:45,909
- What?
- Si Hyun started the bet first...

11
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:48,609
to make Soo Ji feel better.

12
00:00:49,149 --> 00:00:51,479
To him, what kind of girl you were
or who you were...

13
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:52,990
wasn't of any importance.

14
00:00:53,689 --> 00:00:54,950
Si Hyun...

15
00:00:57,289 --> 00:00:58,859
had to remind himself...

16
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,159
of your name a few times
to memorize it.

17
00:01:02,659 --> 00:01:04,600
- What was her name again?
- Eun Tae Hee.

18
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,929
Her name is written right here.
Try to remember.

19
00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:09,540
We found out places
you frequently visited...

20
00:01:09,739 --> 00:01:12,170
and withdrew your application
for the dorm you were to move into.

21
00:01:13,709 --> 00:01:15,879
We thought about putting
an end to the bet at that time,

22
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:18,239
but Si Hyun wouldn't stop.

23
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:21,609
He lied and
went to help you move in.

24
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:24,819
He even let you
move in across his studio.

25
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:28,519
He did everything he could do to
stop you from coming on the trip.

26
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:31,420
He chased after you when
you left early the next morning.

27
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,730
I don't know what happened
between the two of you.

28
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:37,000
But at some point,

29
00:01:37,959 --> 00:01:39,530
he started seeing you in secret,

30
00:01:40,269 --> 00:01:42,870
liking you, and missing you.

31
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:45,500
And he's protecting you too.

32
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:52,680
Are you doing this to me...

33
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:55,180
because Si Hyun started to like me?

34
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,290
I can't care less about
whether he really likes you or not.

35
00:01:59,489 --> 00:02:00,689
It doesn't even matter to me.

36
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:03,219
Do I have a reason
to want to split you two up?

37
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:05,060
I don't have one.

38
00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:08,590
Now, think about this question.

39
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:12,030
Instead of asking
why Si Hyun went after you,

40
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,699
ask this question.

41
00:02:13,699 --> 00:02:16,340
"Why is Se Joo telling me
all this?"

42
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,669
Don't you want to know that now?

43
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:23,509
Enough.

44
00:02:24,509 --> 00:02:26,750
I don't want to hear anything else
you people have to say.

45
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:28,710
Soo Ji,

46
00:02:30,449 --> 00:02:32,349
Si Hyun, and me.

47
00:02:33,349 --> 00:02:35,789
It's because things ended
between the three of us.

48
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:40,289
Si Hyun has left us because of you.

49
00:02:40,789 --> 00:02:42,930
I'm sorry that you became our toy.

50
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,360
But...

51
00:02:44,729 --> 00:02:47,629
you're the only way
I can punish him.

52
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,370
There's nothing else
I can do to him.

53
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,599
Each and every one of you are...

54
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:54,840
nothing but human garbage.

55
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:56,039
We know.

56
00:02:56,539 --> 00:02:59,449
We're impossible, human garbage
who don't care at all...

57
00:02:59,949 --> 00:03:01,479
when we hurt others.

58
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,120
So what?

59
00:03:06,889 --> 00:03:08,889
You enjoy your lavish lives,

60
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:11,490
then complain that your lives
are the hardest on earth.

61
00:03:12,289 --> 00:03:16,030
Even when people get hurt,
they don't live like you.

62
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:21,129
Did you have a blast
when you deceived...

63
00:03:21,629 --> 00:03:24,800
and made fun of me, thinking
it's some kind of a great revenge?

64
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,810
Did this make you feel like
you're above Ki Young?

65
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:31,740
This is disappointing.
I thought you'd be touched.

66
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:35,520
You said Si Hyun loved you...

67
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:37,250
and that you loved him too.

68
00:03:37,849 --> 00:03:40,389
That's why our little nest
got torn apart.

69
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:45,020
Shouldn't you be touched
even after knowing everything...

70
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:47,189
to make sure you stay
as the Great Tae Hee?

71
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:50,629
Someone so great
that you can humiliate us...

72
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:52,300
like that.

73
00:03:53,169 --> 00:03:54,629
What will you do now?

74
00:03:54,629 --> 00:03:58,300
Since you accepted everything else,
will you forgive him for this too?

75
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:00,509
Can you really like him...

76
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:03,310
even after knowing the truth?

77
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:23,819
Are you all right?

78
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,959
(Kwon Si Hyun)

79
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:27,160
Can you get up?

80
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:40,439
Hello?

81
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:43,939
Oh, isn't this Tae Hee's phone?

82
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:47,180
She doesn't seem so well.

83
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:51,149
Where is she?

84
00:06:25,379 --> 00:06:26,449
Tae Hee.

85
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:29,620
Are you okay?

86
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,589
Why are you here?

87
00:06:38,129 --> 00:06:39,300
You know...

88
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:41,899
why I'm here.

89
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,939
- Well...
- I saw it.

90
00:06:46,209 --> 00:06:47,870
Your little nest.

91
00:06:48,939 --> 00:06:50,009
And...

92
00:06:50,839 --> 00:06:53,649
I also saw how you
played around with me.

93
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:55,649
I saw everything.

94
00:06:58,379 --> 00:07:00,750
- Tae Hee.
- Was this why...

95
00:07:01,889 --> 00:07:04,389
you were dying to talk to me?

96
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,560
I can explain everything.

97
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,360
Explain? What will you start with?

98
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,269
How you did my background check?

99
00:07:15,029 --> 00:07:17,670
Or that you asked
Kyung Joo about me?

100
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:23,480
Or about your plan to show up
on the day my dorm got cancelled,

101
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:26,050
pretending to help me out?

102
00:07:27,009 --> 00:07:29,649
And did you come up with the plan
to bring me out on that trip...

103
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:32,720
and to pick me up at the station?

104
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:39,230
How did you know who my mom was?

105
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:42,930
Since when and how much
did you find out about me...

106
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:45,970
before you did this to me?

107
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,370
You three...

108
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:51,199
You three must have had...

109
00:07:52,339 --> 00:07:53,939
a lot of fun.

110
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,709
Why aren't you saying anything?

111
00:07:58,949 --> 00:08:01,410
Did you forget to
come up with a plan...

112
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:03,220
in case you get caught?

113
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:08,050
I remember your asking if I won't
regret my decision in the beginning.

114
00:08:08,649 --> 00:08:10,889
That you're worried
you might make a mistake.

115
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:13,790
You're really something.

116
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:16,730
You left room...

117
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,899
to run away since the beginning.

118
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:20,970
No.

119
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,899
Why did it have to be me?

120
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,040
What did I ever do to you?

121
00:08:27,769 --> 00:08:29,509
Even after hearing...

122
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:32,879
that you and Soo Ji
like each other,

123
00:08:33,009 --> 00:08:35,279
I still trusted the way
you showed your heart to me.

124
00:08:36,019 --> 00:08:37,549
Even when you humiliated me...

125
00:08:37,549 --> 00:08:39,549
in front of your friends
because of your pride,

126
00:08:39,549 --> 00:08:41,389
I held back like an idiot.

127
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:44,720
Because I thought
we liked each other.

128
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:49,230
I thought we could undo
those little misunderstandings.

129
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:51,929
I took you in, held back,
and tried to understand you.

130
00:08:51,929 --> 00:08:53,669
Even if it was difficult,

131
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,639
I did it because I loved you.

132
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:01,809
It was so natural to me.

133
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:05,950
Must I be punished like this...

134
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:10,919
just because I trusted you?

135
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:12,750
It's...

136
00:09:14,149 --> 00:09:15,350
I'm sorry.

137
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:18,720
I know that I can't be forgiven
no matter what I say.

138
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:22,830
But I was serious too.

139
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:23,960
Serious?

140
00:09:26,629 --> 00:09:29,169
If you were
even a bit serious about me,

141
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:32,340
you should've ended everything
when I asked you to break up.

142
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:35,269
No matter how much fun it was
to see...

143
00:09:35,269 --> 00:09:36,779
the idiot I was
for taking you back...

144
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:40,480
No matter how amusing it was to see
the way I embraced you,

145
00:09:41,649 --> 00:09:43,779
you should have stopped
right there and then.

146
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,350
If you're someone who can
do this to someone you like...

147
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,889
If that's the Si Hyun I knew,

148
00:09:51,019 --> 00:09:52,830
then I've never liked you.

149
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:56,059
I've never called out your name,

150
00:09:56,159 --> 00:09:58,529
and I've never even known you.

151
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:07,769
Tae Hee.

152
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:15,049
I came to like you so much.

153
00:10:15,149 --> 00:10:16,649
That's why this happened.

154
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:19,149
I know I wasn't supposed to do that,

155
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:22,460
but I tried to...

156
00:10:23,059 --> 00:10:25,090
extend this day by day,
then ended up like this.

157
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:29,230
At one point,
I came to like you so much...

158
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,059
that I forgot about
how guilty I felt.

159
00:10:32,429 --> 00:10:35,100
I was scared to see time passing by,

160
00:10:37,169 --> 00:10:38,669
but I wanted to...

161
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:43,379
remain as the guy who liked you
for just one more day.

162
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:46,779
Sure.

163
00:10:48,409 --> 00:10:50,250
I'm sure it wasn't in your plan...

164
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:52,720
to actually come to like me.

165
00:10:53,789 --> 00:10:55,519
What you three planned was...

166
00:10:56,019 --> 00:10:57,559
to see me suffer...

167
00:10:58,389 --> 00:11:00,289
after I get abandoned.

168
00:11:02,129 --> 00:11:04,960
- Tae Hee, please.
- What are you trying to get back?

169
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:07,570
I never knew you.

170
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:08,700
No.

171
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,669
I said I was not sure
who you really were...

172
00:11:11,669 --> 00:11:13,769
and that I'd like to find out.

173
00:11:14,009 --> 00:11:17,409
This is the last time
I regret having said that.

174
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:20,049
Don't you get it?

175
00:11:21,179 --> 00:11:23,580
The idiot that you three
wanted to humiliate...

176
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,950
will end up loathing you
for a long time.

177
00:11:26,389 --> 00:11:29,220
I want you to be in
as much pain as my hatred.

178
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:32,830
I want you to suffer.

179
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:37,029
I hope you will never be all right.

180
00:11:37,529 --> 00:11:39,029
If not,

181
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:42,000
I will end up despising myself
for knowing you...

182
00:11:43,139 --> 00:11:46,570
and hating myself
for accepting you every time.

183
00:11:51,409 --> 00:11:53,149
I don't want to ever see you again.

184
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:18,909
(Hye Jeong)

185
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:23,809
(Power Off)

186
00:13:28,169 --> 00:13:29,840
Did you have to do this?

187
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,059
I said...

188
00:13:45,289 --> 00:13:47,990
I'd tell her everything and beg.

189
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:54,029
Did you have to take
that one opportunity from me?

190
00:15:55,389 --> 00:15:58,019
(Recent calls)

191
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:45,470
(Hye Jeong)

192
00:16:52,379 --> 00:16:53,879
Go home.

193
00:16:54,779 --> 00:16:56,850
Your mother will scold you a lot.

194
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,120
No.

195
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:03,360
If I go back home now,
nothing will ever change.

196
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:05,590
Get up. You'll catch a cold.

197
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:39,359
Tae Hee.

198
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:46,029
- Tae Hee.
- Mom.

199
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:49,339
Gosh. Are you okay? Come inside.

200
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:52,200
Kwon Seok Woo, 46 years old, male.

201
00:18:52,529 --> 00:18:55,970
He came in as an outpatient,
requesting we check his tumor.

202
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:59,869
The tumor showed up in both
the CT and MRI.

203
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:02,279
We'll cut it out
in a guided operation.

204
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:05,710
The tumor's putting pressure on
the optic nerves,

205
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:06,980
so we'll observe...

206
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:12,349
The operation will take all day.

207
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:14,390
Okay.

208
00:19:17,619 --> 00:19:19,690
Let's not worry too much.

209
00:19:20,529 --> 00:19:23,630
Our best doctors and I
will do our best to...

210
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:27,069
My dad's a tough guy.
He'll pull through.

211
00:19:30,299 --> 00:19:31,470
Si Hyun.

212
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:35,039
I know I wronged you...

213
00:19:35,609 --> 00:19:37,539
and that I must beg for years.

214
00:19:39,549 --> 00:19:41,049
It'll be hard, I know,

215
00:19:41,349 --> 00:19:43,779
but can't you let me
focus on your dad for now?

216
00:19:46,289 --> 00:19:47,519
Please.

217
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:49,289
Sure.

218
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:52,990
Please take good care of him for me.

219
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,660
Kwon Seok Woo's
being prepped for surgery.

220
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:27,890
He must've named you
as his guardian.

221
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:50,920
Tae Hee.

222
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:55,619
Try to sit up.

223
00:21:01,089 --> 00:21:02,430
Are you okay?

224
00:21:03,829 --> 00:21:06,329
Drink some water,
then go back to sleep.

225
00:21:06,329 --> 00:21:07,369
Take some medicine.

226
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:19,009
Dad's in Seoul.

227
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:23,650
- I heard.
- When he leaves,

228
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:26,150
I'll go with him.

229
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:27,849
What about school?

230
00:21:28,289 --> 00:21:30,759
The more I say,
the worse you'll feel.

231
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:32,990
Shall I still explain?

232
00:21:34,529 --> 00:21:37,960
Only bad things happened to me
since I came back.

233
00:21:39,069 --> 00:21:40,900
We fought every day.

234
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:43,539
I was in an accident.

235
00:21:43,539 --> 00:21:45,099
I suffered and recovered.

236
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:46,640
And then,

237
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:49,509
I thought things were only
going to get better.

238
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,809
I thought if I moved
to Seoul and lived alone,

239
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:57,519
everything was going to be fine.

240
00:21:58,819 --> 00:22:01,019
I got into the college
I wanted to attend.

241
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:03,819
I thought
my life was going to get better.

242
00:22:05,319 --> 00:22:07,430
But now, I just want to
get away from all this.

243
00:22:24,539 --> 00:22:26,309
It's not like you to oversleep.

244
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:31,549
Did you have breakfast?

245
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:35,890
You're concerned about me.
That feels great.

246
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:41,589
Are you taking...

247
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:43,460
those pills again?

248
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,599
It's just because
I can't seem to fall asleep.

249
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:49,400
Where were you this early?

250
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:52,809
Se Joo.

251
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:54,940
What is it?

252
00:22:58,309 --> 00:22:59,509
Did you get hit?

253
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:03,279
I met Si Hyun.

254
00:23:04,119 --> 00:23:05,150
I...

255
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:07,950
told everything to Tae Hee.

256
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,789
Tell her what?

257
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:12,559
Everything.

258
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:14,829
I ended it.

259
00:23:15,259 --> 00:23:16,660
Does Si Hyun know?

260
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:18,930
Probably.

261
00:23:20,299 --> 00:23:21,430
Se Joo.

262
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,569
I'll tell him that
I told you to do this.

263
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,640
What do you mean?

264
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:29,940
- Why would you say that?
- Just listen to me.

265
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:34,450
Si Hyun and I can't go back to
how it used to be anyway.

266
00:23:34,809 --> 00:23:36,819
If Mr. Kwon and my mom get married,

267
00:23:37,579 --> 00:23:40,319
we'd become family
even if he hates me.

268
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:44,890
But I can't stand to watch...

269
00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:48,559
your friendship fall apart.

270
00:23:50,599 --> 00:23:51,730
Okay?

271
00:23:57,569 --> 00:23:58,569
It's Hye Jeong.

272
00:24:00,569 --> 00:24:01,710
Yes, Hye Jeong.

273
00:24:09,079 --> 00:24:11,779
My gosh, what a nice place.

274
00:24:12,079 --> 00:24:15,220
- We can play games here too.
- I know.

275
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:25,329
Make yourselves at home.
No one will come here.

276
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:28,000
Go back home
as soon as possible if you can.

277
00:24:28,869 --> 00:24:31,670
Don't you think your mother
will find you no matter what?

278
00:24:32,509 --> 00:24:34,009
Anyway, thank you, Se Joo.

279
00:24:34,269 --> 00:24:37,309
Thanks to you, she will be safe
even if it's for a day.

280
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,849
I'm sorry for making you worry.

281
00:24:40,849 --> 00:24:41,910
Don't be.

282
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:46,150
Thank Soo Ji. I'm leaving now.

283
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:51,559
Thank you, Se Joo.
We'll clean up the place.

284
00:24:51,559 --> 00:24:52,930
We'll do that.

285
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:56,529
- Should we clean up?
- Yes, let's do that.

286
00:24:56,529 --> 00:24:59,170
Where are you, Hye Jeong?

287
00:25:01,329 --> 00:25:03,369
- You have a guest, ma'am.
- Goodness.

288
00:25:07,539 --> 00:25:08,539
Ms. Jo.

289
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:11,480
You won't be able to attend
the meeting with my family, right?

290
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:13,150
It's because of Hye Jeong.

291
00:25:17,779 --> 00:25:19,450
What should we do?

292
00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:22,190
I'm in a pickle too.

293
00:25:23,319 --> 00:25:25,160
I don't know what to tell them.

294
00:25:25,859 --> 00:25:28,329
I can't say Hye Jeong ran away
from home.

295
00:25:29,329 --> 00:25:30,400
However,

296
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:32,869
families are supposed
to help each other out...

297
00:25:32,869 --> 00:25:35,299
even though they may fight
from time to time.

298
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:38,799
We'll be family soon.

299
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,140
Should I help you out?

300
00:25:42,339 --> 00:25:44,740
Could you do that for me?

301
00:25:47,109 --> 00:25:48,779
All right...

302
00:25:50,819 --> 00:25:52,220
Hello, Secretary Kim.

303
00:25:53,319 --> 00:25:55,619
Today's family meeting is canceled.

304
00:25:57,789 --> 00:26:00,589
Tell my father that...

305
00:26:00,859 --> 00:26:02,660
Ms. Jo is very sick.

306
00:26:03,559 --> 00:26:07,099
Tell him that I'm personally
taking her to the hospital.

307
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:11,170
It's done.

308
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,910
It won't take long to
locate Hye Jeong.

309
00:26:14,309 --> 00:26:15,509
Korea is a small country.

310
00:26:23,319 --> 00:26:27,089
(Assemblyman Kim Se Cheol)

311
00:26:28,789 --> 00:26:30,319
Hello, Assemblyman Kim.

312
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:33,289
I heard that the clinical trials are
being evaluated now.

313
00:26:33,289 --> 00:26:34,390
Thank you.

314
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:36,960
When does your VIP center close?

315
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,299
It closes at 7pm.

316
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:42,940
My gosh,
the center closes quite early.

317
00:26:43,869 --> 00:26:46,569
Well, you know the promise
you made the other day.

318
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:50,240
Some of my VIPs
will be there by 8pm.

319
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:51,779
Please take good care of them.

320
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:57,279
Okay, I understand.

321
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,230
Hi.

322
00:27:14,170 --> 00:27:17,269
Mr. Kwon is in surgery now.
It's going well.

323
00:27:18,599 --> 00:27:19,640
Okay.

324
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:22,210
Si Hyun is in his ward now.

325
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,650
Okay.

326
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,519
What's wrong with you?

327
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,930
Mr. Kwon is still in surgery.

328
00:28:19,930 --> 00:28:22,269
My mom said that
it will take the entire day.

329
00:28:25,769 --> 00:28:27,710
Why did you do that?
You should've kept it on.

330
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,349
About the other day
in the parking lot...

331
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:41,049
- I'm sorry.
- Why would you be sorry?

332
00:28:42,289 --> 00:28:44,960
At least, I deserved that.

333
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:51,759
You should've just run me over.

334
00:28:52,829 --> 00:28:54,470
If you did, she wouldn't have...

335
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:56,299
known anything,
and I would've thanked you.

336
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:57,970
Si Hyun.

337
00:29:00,609 --> 00:29:02,309
I asked Se Joo...

338
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:05,309
to tell everything to Tae Hee.

339
00:29:09,079 --> 00:29:11,380
You know that
Se Joo will do anything I ask.

340
00:29:12,619 --> 00:29:15,349
I asked him to tell her that
because I wanted to hurt her.

341
00:29:17,819 --> 00:29:20,130
So don't resent Se Joo.

342
00:29:20,690 --> 00:29:21,890
Soo Ji.

343
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:25,700
Think about everything
we have done all these years.

344
00:29:27,069 --> 00:29:29,799
We are such monsters, aren't we?

345
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:33,609
No.

346
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:37,539
I'm in no position to judge you two.

347
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,750
I didn't do anything right either.

348
00:29:41,809 --> 00:29:44,750
How did we get here?

349
00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:54,359
I'm sorry.

350
00:29:55,529 --> 00:29:56,599
But...

351
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:59,630
let's not ever see each other again.

352
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:04,769
Even if we meet by coincidence,

353
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:07,740
let's pretend
we don't know each other.
