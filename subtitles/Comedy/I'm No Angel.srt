1
00:01:47,292 --> 00:01:50,289
Right this way, folks!

2
00:01:54,285 --> 00:01:58,281
Gather round. That's right.
You gotta hear me.

3
00:01:58,281 --> 00:02:01,278
All right. You will see a show of amazing...

4
00:02:01,278 --> 00:02:03,276
stupendous and cataclysmic proportions.

5
00:02:03,276 --> 00:02:05,274
Your two bits will do the work of a sawbuck.

6
00:02:05,274 --> 00:02:09,270
From the inside, folks, you're gonna see,
right before your very eyes...

7
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:12,267
without the aid of cheaters or a microscope...

8
00:02:12,267 --> 00:02:14,265
- Joe, the Turtle Boy.
- That's it, the picture.

9
00:02:16,263 --> 00:02:18,261
Jail me, folks, if I ain't telling the truth.

10
00:02:18,261 --> 00:02:20,259
He walks, eats and sleeps just like a turtle...

11
00:02:20,259 --> 00:02:23,256
but talks the English language
as well as you and I.

12
00:02:23,256 --> 00:02:26,253
<i>And shaves himself with a safety razor.</i>

13
00:02:26,253 --> 00:02:29,250
<i>And as an added attraction folks,</i>
<i>Joe plays the zither.</i>

14
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:32,247
<i>Believe it or not, folks, he plays the zither.</i>

15
00:02:32,247 --> 00:02:34,245
<i>That's what you'll see when you go inside.</i>

16
00:02:34,245 --> 00:02:36,243
What did you get?
Not much.

17
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,238
Them birds have to work for a living.

18
00:02:42,237 --> 00:02:45,234
These tickers look like a lot of heirlooms.
Look at them.

19
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:52,227
And that, folks, is only a sample
of what you're gonna see for the one price.

20
00:02:52,227 --> 00:02:56,223
Now look, folks, you've got to give me
your undivided attention...

21
00:02:56,223 --> 00:02:59,220
because I want you to hear
each and every word that I'm going to say.

22
00:03:00,219 --> 00:03:04,215
Over there, Tira, the beautiful Tira!

23
00:03:05,214 --> 00:03:08,211
Dancing, singing marvel of the age!

24
00:03:08,211 --> 00:03:10,209
Supreme flower of feminine pulchritude!

25
00:03:10,209 --> 00:03:14,205
The girl who discovered
you don't have to have feet to be a dancer.

26
00:03:14,205 --> 00:03:17,202
Boys, just push right in there,
you're gonna have a better view.

27
00:03:17,202 --> 00:03:20,199
All right, boys, the lumber. Drag it out!
Pull ahead, men!

28
00:04:02,157 --> 00:04:05,154
If I wasn't a married man,
I could go for you, baby.

29
00:04:05,154 --> 00:04:06,153
No wisecracks, now.

30
00:04:12,147 --> 00:04:14,145
A penny for your thoughts.

31
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:21,138
Tira, boys! Tira!

32
00:04:21,138 --> 00:04:23,136
Just look at those eyes.

33
00:04:24,135 --> 00:04:26,133
I dig those eyes.

34
00:04:27,132 --> 00:04:31,128
Boys, she can assume shapes
that will astonish a chiropractor!

35
00:04:31,128 --> 00:04:34,125
<i>And next to her</i>
<i>a wiggling worm looks paralysed.</i>

36
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:36,123
Get the idea, boys?

37
00:04:36,123 --> 00:04:39,120
I can say
without fear of contradiction...

38
00:04:41,118 --> 00:04:44,115
that if Tira had played the town at the time...

39
00:04:45,114 --> 00:04:47,112
Noah would have missed the boat.

40
00:04:47,112 --> 00:04:48,111
You follow me?

41
00:04:50,109 --> 00:04:52,107
Boys, with the right kind of encouragement...

42
00:04:52,107 --> 00:04:54,105
she'll throw discretion to the winds...

43
00:04:54,105 --> 00:04:56,103
and her hips
to the north, east, south and west.

44
00:04:56,103 --> 00:04:59,100
It's the only show on earth
where the tickets are made of asbestos.

45
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:04,095
And now inside, Tira,
the girl who makes your dreams come true.

46
00:05:05,094 --> 00:05:06,093
Step right up, men.

47
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:12,087
Does she do her stuff?
You bet she can do it.

48
00:05:45,054 --> 00:05:47,052
Oh, mama!

49
00:05:48,051 --> 00:05:50,049
I know just how you feel, honey.

50
00:05:57,042 --> 00:06:00,039
- Is that elegant or is that elegant?
- Elegant.

51
00:06:05,034 --> 00:06:08,031
<i>They call me Sister Honky-Tonk</i>

52
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:11,028
<i>I've got the face of a saint</i>

53
00:06:11,028 --> 00:06:14,025
<i>On the level, it ain't paint</i>

54
00:06:14,025 --> 00:06:17,022
<i>Beware of these eyes</i>

55
00:06:18,021 --> 00:06:23,016
<i>I'm a devil in disguise</i>

56
00:06:23,016 --> 00:06:26,013
<i>And they call me Sister Honky-Tonk</i>

57
00:06:26,013 --> 00:06:28,011
<i>Get over dirty</i>

58
00:06:28,011 --> 00:06:31,008
<i>They call me Sister Honky-Tonk</i>

59
00:07:10,968 --> 00:07:13,965
<i>Just play a passionate strain</i>

60
00:07:13,965 --> 00:07:16,962
<i>And I'll be low down again</i>

61
00:07:16,962 --> 00:07:19,959
<i>It's fire and it's flame</i>

62
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:22,956
<i>So be careful of this dame</i>

63
00:07:22,956 --> 00:07:26,952
<i>They call me Sister Honky-Tonk</i>

64
00:07:26,952 --> 00:07:27,951
<i>I got to scram now</i>

65
00:07:40,938 --> 00:07:42,936
Am I making myself clear, boys?

66
00:07:46,932 --> 00:07:47,931
Suckers.

67
00:07:49,929 --> 00:07:53,925
Tomorrow night at the same time: Tira!

68
00:07:55,923 --> 00:07:59,919
Tira, you're gonna be a good girl
and work them lions tonight, ain't you?

69
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:02,916
No, I'm gonna be a bad girl
and go home to bed.

70
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:04,914
- No.
- I'm tired from tossing my hips.

71
00:08:04,914 --> 00:08:07,911
- I know, but...
- Besides the cat act's on too late, anyway.

72
00:08:07,911 --> 00:08:09,909
I'll work them tomorrow night
if you put them on earlier.

73
00:08:10,908 --> 00:08:12,906
Sometime you'll ask me
to do you a favour and I'll...

74
00:08:12,906 --> 00:08:13,905
So what?

75
00:08:14,904 --> 00:08:18,900
- Hello, honey.
- I've just been working on you.

76
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:20,898
Oh, yeah?

77
00:08:20,898 --> 00:08:24,894
- What have you got to tell me tonight?
- I have your horoscope.

78
00:08:24,894 --> 00:08:26,892
- I hope you got some good news in it.
- Good and bad.

79
00:08:26,892 --> 00:08:28,890
Go ahead, I got my fingers crossed.

80
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:30,888
You were born in August.

81
00:08:30,888 --> 00:08:33,885
- Yes, one of the hot months.
- It was on the 17th...

82
00:08:34,884 --> 00:08:36,882
under the sign of Leo, the lion.

83
00:08:36,882 --> 00:08:38,880
King of the beasts, huh?

84
00:08:40,878 --> 00:08:42,876
Today is not lucky for you.

85
00:08:42,876 --> 00:08:44,874
I can't complain. So far it's been perfect.

86
00:08:45,873 --> 00:08:48,870
Tomorrow will be very lucky.

87
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:50,868
But tonight, be careful.

88
00:08:51,867 --> 00:08:53,865
Something told me not to work
that lion act tonight.

89
00:08:53,865 --> 00:08:55,863
You are very wise.

90
00:08:55,863 --> 00:08:57,861
I profit by my experience.

91
00:08:57,861 --> 00:09:00,858
Now listen, honey,
you just tell me about my future.

92
00:09:01,857 --> 00:09:03,855
You see, I know all about my past.

93
00:09:06,852 --> 00:09:08,850
You have a wonderful future.

94
00:09:10,848 --> 00:09:12,846
I see a man in your life.

95
00:09:14,844 --> 00:09:15,843
What, only one?

96
00:09:16,842 --> 00:09:19,839
But this is one very particular man.

97
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:22,836
He is very wealthy. Enormously wealthy.

98
00:09:22,836 --> 00:09:25,833
You mean a millionaire.
What does he look like?

99
00:09:26,832 --> 00:09:29,829
I see he has brown eyes.

100
00:09:29,829 --> 00:09:31,827
In fact, I see two men.

101
00:09:31,827 --> 00:09:33,825
You don't mean twins?

102
00:09:35,823 --> 00:09:38,820
No. Two different men.

103
00:09:39,819 --> 00:09:42,816
In the near future I see a change.

104
00:09:43,815 --> 00:09:46,812
What, a change of men?
Not yet.

105
00:09:47,811 --> 00:09:49,809
<i>I see a change of position.</i>

106
00:09:50,808 --> 00:09:51,807
Sitting or reclining?

107
00:09:53,805 --> 00:09:55,803
But it's all left me.

108
00:09:57,801 --> 00:10:00,798
I can't help you anymore tonight. I can't.

109
00:10:01,797 --> 00:10:04,794
Thanks, Rajah.
It's all right, I'm in a hurry anyway.

110
00:10:04,794 --> 00:10:06,792
- Give me my thing.
- Horoscope.

111
00:10:06,792 --> 00:10:09,789
Keep this where you may
consult it frequently.

112
00:10:09,789 --> 00:10:11,787
All right, I'll take it to bed with me.

113
00:10:13,785 --> 00:10:16,782
What are you playing me the chill for
all of a sudden, baby?

114
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:18,780
Because I ain't exactly in the mood.

115
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:20,778
Seems like I can't put you
in the mood, lately.

116
00:10:20,778 --> 00:10:21,777
I guess you're right.

117
00:10:25,773 --> 00:10:28,770
Barton wants you to get in the cage
and wrestle them lions tonight.

118
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:29,769
Not tonight. I told Barton.

119
00:10:29,769 --> 00:10:33,765
Tira, you've got to. The show is walking
on its heels in this town.

120
00:10:33,765 --> 00:10:34,764
What's the rush?

121
00:10:36,762 --> 00:10:39,759
You seem awful anxious to get somewhere.

122
00:10:40,758 --> 00:10:43,755
- Pulling something funny, if you ask me.
- I ain't asking you.

123
00:10:43,755 --> 00:10:44,754
I'm asking you.

124
00:10:46,752 --> 00:10:48,750
What do you want to stay
in a hotel in town for?

125
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,748
Why don't you stay on the lot,
same as the rest of us?

126
00:10:50,748 --> 00:10:52,746
'Cause I ain't the same as the rest of you.

127
00:10:52,746 --> 00:10:54,744
I'm sick of people worrying about what I do.

128
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:01,737
I get about as much privacy around here
as a goldfish.

129
00:11:01,737 --> 00:11:03,735
Getting high hat, huh?

130
00:11:05,733 --> 00:11:08,730
What did you do? Got you a haircut
or have your ears moved down?

131
00:11:11,727 --> 00:11:12,726
It's a wonder you noticed.

132
00:11:13,725 --> 00:11:16,722
Miss Tira.
Come in, honey.

133
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,718
A gentleman gave me this note for you.

134
00:11:21,717 --> 00:11:23,715
What's your name?

135
00:11:23,715 --> 00:11:25,713
My name is Frederick, but they calls me Otto.

136
00:11:27,711 --> 00:11:30,708
All right, honey,
you tell the gentleman it's okay.

137
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:31,707
Yes, ma'am.

138
00:11:31,707 --> 00:11:34,704
- Who's the boyfriend?
- Wouldn't you like to know?

139
00:11:35,703 --> 00:11:38,700
I tell you, you go mixing up with any guy
and I'll bust his jaw.

140
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:41,697
I'll break him in two, you hear?
I'll give him the works.

141
00:11:41,697 --> 00:11:43,695
If you ain't careful,
you're liable to hurt somebody.

142
00:11:43,695 --> 00:11:45,693
Take that as a warning.

143
00:11:45,693 --> 00:11:48,690
You take it and bury it,
maybe it will grow lilies.

144
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:51,687
- I'll see you later.
- The later, the better.

145
00:11:53,685 --> 00:11:56,682
Tira, can I come in?
Come on in.

146
00:11:56,682 --> 00:11:58,680
See, I just felt I had to talk to somebody.

147
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:02,676
I'm in a rush, but go ahead and talk.

148
00:12:02,676 --> 00:12:04,674
You look terrible. What's the matter?

149
00:12:04,674 --> 00:12:07,671
Everything is the matter, with me anyhow.

150
00:12:07,671 --> 00:12:09,669
- Barton again?
- Yeah.

151
00:12:09,669 --> 00:12:10,668
That guy is a habit with you, honey.

152
00:12:11,667 --> 00:12:13,665
Why don't you step out?
A change will do you good.

153
00:12:13,665 --> 00:12:15,663
- That's what I'm doing.
- What about Slick?

154
00:12:15,663 --> 00:12:19,659
He's all right. If he kept his hands
out of other people's pockets.

155
00:12:20,658 --> 00:12:22,656
What is it gonna get me
hanging around him?

156
00:12:22,656 --> 00:12:24,654
I got ideas.

157
00:12:25,653 --> 00:12:29,649
Somewhere there's a guy with a million
waiting for a dame like me.

158
00:12:29,649 --> 00:12:30,648
Rajah said so.

159
00:12:32,646 --> 00:12:35,643
Tira, you always have such swell things.

160
00:12:35,643 --> 00:12:37,641
How do you do it on your salary?

161
00:12:37,641 --> 00:12:39,639
It's a gift, honey.

162
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:41,637
Them beads is pretty.

163
00:12:41,637 --> 00:12:42,636
They are kind of pretty.

164
00:12:44,634 --> 00:12:47,631
He gave me them. Genuine amber.

165
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:50,628
The beads, I mean.

166
00:12:50,628 --> 00:12:54,624
And these here handkerchiefs,
genuine Madeira.

167
00:12:57,621 --> 00:12:59,619
No, he gave me the pillows.

168
00:12:59,619 --> 00:13:01,617
Here, here's the baby.
He gave me them.

169
00:13:02,616 --> 00:13:06,612
And this here sailor,
he gave me this here jade set...

170
00:13:07,611 --> 00:13:11,607
he got in Shanghai, genuine jade, he said.

171
00:13:11,607 --> 00:13:12,606
Here.

172
00:13:15,603 --> 00:13:17,601
Tira, they're beautiful.

173
00:13:17,601 --> 00:13:19,599
- You like them?
- Yes.

174
00:13:19,599 --> 00:13:22,596
Try them on. If they do something to you,
you can have them.

175
00:13:22,596 --> 00:13:24,594
Thanks.
Don't mention it.

176
00:13:24,594 --> 00:13:29,589
I'd like to stick around and show you
the rest of my stuff, but I got a heavy date.

177
00:13:29,589 --> 00:13:31,587
I gotta be leaving you.

178
00:13:31,587 --> 00:13:34,584
- Tira, how can I ever thank you?
- Don't.

179
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:37,581
Why, you look better already.

180
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:41,577
Say, you're a good-looking dame.

181
00:13:41,577 --> 00:13:44,574
There is a lot of guys
that would go for you in a big way.

182
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:47,571
Always remember, honey, a good motto is:

183
00:13:47,571 --> 00:13:50,568
"Take all you can get
and give as little as possible."

184
00:13:50,568 --> 00:13:53,565
Don't forget, honey,
never let one man worry your mind.

185
00:13:53,565 --> 00:13:56,562
Find them, fool them, forget them.
Thanks again.

186
00:13:56,562 --> 00:13:58,560
Hello, how's the joints tonight?
Fine.

187
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,558
Swell, Tira.
Hello, Tira.

188
00:14:01,557 --> 00:14:04,554
This is the first chance
I've had to talk to you.

189
00:14:04,554 --> 00:14:07,551
- When are we going out again together?
- Almost anytime you say, Harry.

190
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:09,549
I got to see you more often.

191
00:14:09,549 --> 00:14:13,545
- You know, I'm kind of crazy about you.
- Oh, yeah?

192
00:14:13,545 --> 00:14:15,543
- Can't get you out of my mind.
- That's bad.

193
00:14:15,543 --> 00:14:18,540
Better not be thinking about me
when you're up there in the flying rings.

194
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:20,538
- Something's liable to happen.
- Not a chance.

195
00:14:21,537 --> 00:14:23,535
How about us going somewhere
after the show tonight?

196
00:14:23,535 --> 00:14:25,533
Not tonight, I gotta see my aunt.

197
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:28,530
Tira, us fellows are worried
about Harry here.

198
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:31,527
He don't eat enough,
won't even sleep enough.

199
00:14:31,527 --> 00:14:34,524
Love, you know, is bad for an acrobat.

200
00:14:34,524 --> 00:14:37,521
Don't worry. I ain't gonna hurt him.

201
00:14:37,521 --> 00:14:39,519
I only wanna feel his muscles.

202
00:14:40,518 --> 00:14:41,517
Bye, Harry.

203
00:14:53,505 --> 00:14:57,501
I never met anybody
just like you before. You're different.

204
00:14:57,501 --> 00:14:59,499
Anything different always costs more
but it's worth it.

205
00:15:01,497 --> 00:15:03,495
By the way, you married or single?

206
00:15:03,495 --> 00:15:05,493
Married five times.
Five times.

207
00:15:06,492 --> 00:15:08,490
Wedding bells must sound
like an alarm clock to you.

208
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:11,487
I don't' suppose
you believe in marriage, do you?

209
00:15:11,487 --> 00:15:12,486
Only as a last resort.

210
00:15:13,485 --> 00:15:15,483
What do you do for a living?

211
00:15:17,481 --> 00:15:19,479
I'm sort of a politician.

212
00:15:19,479 --> 00:15:21,477
I don't like work, either.

213
00:15:23,475 --> 00:15:26,472
I like to get around and travel.

214
00:15:26,472 --> 00:15:29,469
Believe me, I've been places and seen things.

215
00:15:30,468 --> 00:15:32,466
I've been things and seen places.

216
00:15:32,466 --> 00:15:34,464
That sort of evens us up, eh?

217
00:15:36,462 --> 00:15:37,461
Sit down.

218
00:15:42,456 --> 00:15:44,454
I didn't get your name.

219
00:15:44,454 --> 00:15:47,451
I don't give my name to everybody,
but it's...

220
00:15:47,451 --> 00:15:49,449
Don't tell me it's Smith.
No.

221
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:52,446
- Brown. Ernest Brown.
- That will do.

222
00:15:53,445 --> 00:15:55,443
What colour are you eyes?
I don't know.

223
00:15:56,442 --> 00:15:58,440
You like them?
Lovely.

224
00:16:00,438 --> 00:16:02,436
Where did you say you are from?

225
00:16:02,436 --> 00:16:05,433
Don't think I've said,
but I'm from Dallas, Texas.

226
00:16:05,433 --> 00:16:07,431
Dallas, huh?

227
00:16:07,431 --> 00:16:10,428
I see. Pardon me.

228
00:16:14,424 --> 00:16:16,422
Dallas, huh?

229
00:16:29,409 --> 00:16:31,407
There we are.

230
00:16:33,405 --> 00:16:35,403
Dallas, huh?

231
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:52,386
<i>No one loves me like that Dallas man</i>

232
00:16:53,385 --> 00:16:55,383
Bet your life no one loves you
like that Dallas man.

233
00:16:56,382 --> 00:16:57,381
<i>Kisses sweet like honey</i>

234
00:16:57,381 --> 00:16:58,380
Oh, yeah?

235
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:01,377
<i>Smiles that big and sunny</i>

236
00:17:01,377 --> 00:17:05,373
<i>No one loves me like that Dallas man</i>

237
00:17:06,372 --> 00:17:09,369
<i>Why, folks, he's got backbone</i>

238
00:17:09,369 --> 00:17:12,366
<i>He's a Texas cyclone</i>

239
00:17:12,366 --> 00:17:16,362
<i>No one loves me like that Dallas man</i>

240
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:22,356
<i>Why, brother, he's a wild-horse trainer</i>

241
00:17:22,356 --> 00:17:25,353
<i>With a special whip</i>

242
00:17:25,353 --> 00:17:28,350
<i>Gals, you'll go insaner</i>

243
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:31,347
<i>When he gets you in his grip</i>

244
00:17:31,347 --> 00:17:34,344
<i>Strong arms made for loving</i>

245
00:17:35,343 --> 00:17:37,341
<i>Heat like from an oven</i>

246
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:41,337
<i>No one loves me like that Dallas man</i>

247
00:18:01,317 --> 00:18:05,313
You just put your heart and soul
in your dancing, don't you, honey?

248
00:18:07,311 --> 00:18:09,309
You've certainly given me
the time of my life, baby.

249
00:18:09,309 --> 00:18:12,306
Don't say "given,"
I don't like that word "given."

250
00:18:19,299 --> 00:18:21,297
Do pretty well for yourself, don't you?

251
00:18:21,297 --> 00:18:23,295
That's nothing.

252
00:18:25,293 --> 00:18:29,289
Ever take a crack at show business?
That's one business I never tried.

253
00:18:30,288 --> 00:18:32,286
You ought to do great in that racket.

254
00:18:32,286 --> 00:18:36,282
In front of the tent, the big boss.
You mean with a cigar?

255
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:37,281
You catch on.

256
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:42,276
Maybe I can fix it up with Mr. Barton
to sell you an interest in the show.

257
00:18:42,276 --> 00:18:45,273
Then I can take the leading lady out
all the time, huh?

258
00:18:45,273 --> 00:18:46,272
That's the angle.

259
00:18:46,272 --> 00:18:48,270
We'll talk that over later.

260
00:18:49,269 --> 00:18:51,267
Remember your five wives.

261
00:18:51,267 --> 00:18:54,264
You're the baby that can make me
forget them. Kiss Papa.

262
00:18:56,262 --> 00:18:58,260
Give me a long one.

263
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:01,257
You ain't the only girl I've ever kissed.

264
00:19:01,257 --> 00:19:03,255
You got a lot to learn even at that.

265
00:19:09,249 --> 00:19:12,246
What do you mean
by busting in here like this?

266
00:19:13,245 --> 00:19:15,243
What are you doing here with my wife?

267
00:19:15,243 --> 00:19:17,241
Your wife?
He's lying, I ain't his wife.

268
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,238
You can't get away with this.
Listen, you're in a tough spot.

269
00:19:21,237 --> 00:19:24,234
Wait, let me get this straight.
You got it straight.

270
00:19:24,234 --> 00:19:27,231
It's gonna be just too bad for you
when I call the cops.

271
00:19:32,226 --> 00:19:33,225
You can't shake this guy down.

272
00:19:33,225 --> 00:19:36,222
Here I am about to promote him
for dough, you come in to spoil it.

273
00:19:36,222 --> 00:19:38,220
Don't give me that.

274
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:42,216
I get it. You all don't have to talk it over.
I reckon I'm leaving right now.

275
00:19:44,214 --> 00:19:47,211
No, you ain't.
There's a business matter to settle first.

276
00:19:47,211 --> 00:19:48,210
I won't give you a nickel.

277
00:19:49,209 --> 00:19:52,206
You picked the wrong one.
I got connections in this town.

278
00:19:52,206 --> 00:19:54,204
I'll see that you get
what's coming to you.

279
00:19:55,203 --> 00:19:56,202
Now wait a minute.

280
00:20:00,198 --> 00:20:03,195
I've laid out bigger chumps
than you, you mug.

281
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:11,187
- Now try and get out of this.
- You're in it with me.

282
00:20:11,187 --> 00:20:13,185
As fast as you pick them up, I'll drop them.

283
00:20:13,185 --> 00:20:16,182
Yeah? He ain't doing so good.
You better look him over.

284
00:20:22,176 --> 00:20:25,173
- I think he's croaked.
- Ain't that nice.

285
00:20:25,173 --> 00:20:28,170
I told you them barroom tricks of yours
will get us in trouble.

286
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:29,169
Come on, we gotta lam.

287
00:20:30,168 --> 00:20:32,166
What? Leave him here in my place
for the cops to find?

288
00:20:33,165 --> 00:20:36,162
I ain't taking any rap
for something you've done.

289
00:20:36,162 --> 00:20:39,159
You like me to get sent up,
so you can have a free hand with the boys.

290
00:20:39,159 --> 00:20:41,157
What a good time you'd have.

291
00:20:41,157 --> 00:20:45,153
Listen, you may be tired of me,
but I ain't tired of you.

292
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:50,148
There ain't no time for that now.
Get him out of here.

293
00:20:51,147 --> 00:20:52,146
Where am I gonna put a stiff in this joint?

294
00:20:53,145 --> 00:20:56,142
Put him out in the hall.
They can't tell who did it then.

295
00:21:04,134 --> 00:21:08,130
Hey, lay off.
Ain't you got no respect for the dead?

296
00:21:10,128 --> 00:21:11,127
Come on, let's blow.

297
00:21:22,116 --> 00:21:25,113
Is he dead?
He's coming around.

298
00:21:25,113 --> 00:21:26,112
Got a crack on his head.

299
00:21:26,112 --> 00:21:27,111
Wonder how.

300
00:21:27,111 --> 00:21:29,109
Did you people hear any noise?

301
00:21:29,109 --> 00:21:30,108
Sure, I heard a phonograph playing.

302
00:21:30,108 --> 00:21:33,105
That's it. Take it easy, partner.
Got any idea who did this?

303
00:21:35,103 --> 00:21:36,102
It's one of them circus fellows.

304
00:21:36,102 --> 00:21:39,099
- Pick him out?
- Sure I can pick him.

305
00:21:40,098 --> 00:21:41,097
- Say, I've been robbed!
- Are you sure?

306
00:21:42,096 --> 00:21:44,094
I had a diamond that big
in a ring on my finger.

307
00:21:45,093 --> 00:21:48,090
We'll get some of the boys to pick him up
if he ain't left town.

308
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:49,089
- Can you make the grade?
- Sure.

309
00:21:49,089 --> 00:21:50,088
Right this way.

310
00:22:00,078 --> 00:22:02,076
That's him.
Through the tent.

311
00:22:02,076 --> 00:22:04,074
Move, boys.
That's him.

312
00:22:04,074 --> 00:22:06,072
<i>That's him, men, hurry up.</i>

313
00:22:07,071 --> 00:22:08,070
<i>There he goes. Don't let him get away.</i>

314
00:22:11,067 --> 00:22:12,066
<i>Catch him, men.</i>

315
00:22:12,066 --> 00:22:14,064
You're not going to pull that on me.

316
00:22:14,064 --> 00:22:15,063
Help!

317
00:22:17,061 --> 00:22:19,059
None of that. Don't start no riot.

318
00:22:19,059 --> 00:22:21,057
- That's him.
- Go ahead, frisk him.

319
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:29,049
Come on.

320
00:22:29,049 --> 00:22:31,047
That's it.
You sure?

321
00:22:31,047 --> 00:22:33,045
I can prove it.
Take him along.

322
00:22:34,044 --> 00:22:37,041
- But it's mine.
- It's evidence, give it here. Come on.

323
00:22:49,029 --> 00:22:51,027
- Our phone working?
- Yeah.

324
00:22:51,027 --> 00:22:53,025
Thanks.

325
00:22:53,025 --> 00:22:56,022
- Hello. Give me long distance.
- Long distance?

326
00:22:56,022 --> 00:22:58,020
- Ain't you never heard of it?
- Anything wrong?

327
00:22:59,019 --> 00:23:03,015
Cops picked up Slick for knocking over
a guy and lifting his diamond ring.

328
00:23:03,015 --> 00:23:05,013
He pulled that job here?
Don't worry.

329
00:23:05,013 --> 00:23:07,011
You're safe. It's me that they...

330
00:23:07,011 --> 00:23:09,009
Hello. Long distance?

331
00:23:10,008 --> 00:23:12,006
I want to talk to Benny Pinkowitz.

332
00:23:12,006 --> 00:23:16,002
New York City. I don't know. He lives
around 88th Street and Riverside Drive.

333
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:18,999
Pinkowitz.

334
00:23:19,998 --> 00:23:21,996
Pinkowitz, I said.

335
00:23:23,994 --> 00:23:25,992
All right, I'll spell it for you.

336
00:23:25,992 --> 00:23:29,988
"P" like in pansy.

337
00:23:30,987 --> 00:23:34,983
I- N-K-O-W...

338
00:23:34,983 --> 00:23:36,981
"W" like in witch.

339
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:38,979
No, witch!

340
00:23:38,979 --> 00:23:40,977
Dame misunderstood me.

341
00:23:41,976 --> 00:23:43,974
I- T...

342
00:23:44,973 --> 00:23:45,972
"T" like in tomato.

343
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:48,969
"Z."

344
00:23:49,968 --> 00:23:52,965
Put them all together, they spell "Pinkowitz."

345
00:23:52,965 --> 00:23:54,963
All right, you'll ring me?

346
00:23:54,963 --> 00:23:56,961
Okay.

347
00:23:56,961 --> 00:23:57,960
Why are you calling that shyster?

348
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,958
He helped me beat one rap,
and he can do it again.

349
00:23:59,958 --> 00:24:01,956
How're you mixed up in this?

350
00:24:01,956 --> 00:24:02,955
Like an olive in a martini.

351
00:24:08,949 --> 00:24:10,947
Hello.

352
00:24:13,944 --> 00:24:14,943
That's service.

353
00:24:16,941 --> 00:24:18,939
Hello, Benny?

354
00:24:18,939 --> 00:24:19,938
Benny, this is Tira.

355
00:24:19,938 --> 00:24:21,936
Hello, Tira.

356
00:24:22,935 --> 00:24:24,933
It's all right. You didn't disturb me.

357
00:24:25,932 --> 00:24:26,931
What is this time?

358
00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:29,928
Can that be the truth?

359
00:24:31,926 --> 00:24:34,923
All right, I'll catch the first train out.

360
00:24:35,922 --> 00:24:37,920
Maybe for you, Tira, I can do something.

361
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:40,917
But as for Slick, I ain't so sure.

362
00:24:40,917 --> 00:24:42,915
Say, have you got any money?

363
00:24:42,915 --> 00:24:45,912
It will take a nice piece of change
to square up everything.

364
00:24:45,912 --> 00:24:47,910
About myself, I ain't asking a nickel.

365
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:51,906
Don't worry, Benny. I'll have the money
when you get here. Only work fast.

366
00:24:51,906 --> 00:24:54,903
Leave it to me. Goodbye. See you later.

367
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:00,897
Hey, operator, listen...

368
00:25:01,896 --> 00:25:04,893
I don't accept reverse charges. Yeah.

369
00:25:05,892 --> 00:25:07,890
Bill, you gotta let me have some dough.

370
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:09,888
You're asking favours of me now?

371
00:25:10,887 --> 00:25:12,885
All right, you win. Give me a light.

372
00:25:14,883 --> 00:25:17,880
If you'd been nicer to me
and worked the way I wanted you to...

373
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,878
why then...

374
00:25:19,878 --> 00:25:21,876
It's either one thing or the other.

375
00:25:21,876 --> 00:25:23,874
You fix me up with dough
or I gotta get out of town.

376
00:25:24,873 --> 00:25:27,870
If Slick goes up,
he's gonna drag me with him.

377
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:30,867
<i>I want the dough,</i>
<i>and I'll pay you back as soon as I can.</i>

378
00:25:31,866 --> 00:25:33,864
<i>I wanna help around here.</i>

379
00:25:33,864 --> 00:25:35,862
I'm willing to do my share,
more than my share.

380
00:25:36,861 --> 00:25:38,859
I'll work them cats
like they've never been worked.

381
00:25:38,859 --> 00:25:41,856
If it'll make you happy,
I'll even stick my head in the big cat's mouth.

382
00:25:41,856 --> 00:25:43,854
Think it over.

383
00:25:45,852 --> 00:25:47,850
She'll stick her head in the big cat's mouth?

384
00:25:50,847 --> 00:25:53,844
This is big. If she'll do that,
your fortune's as good as made.

385
00:25:53,844 --> 00:25:55,842
The Big Show would grab that act
in a minute.

386
00:25:55,842 --> 00:25:58,839
They've been all season
looking for an attraction like that.

387
00:25:58,839 --> 00:26:01,836
They've been wanting something big.
This is it. Can't you see it?

388
00:26:01,836 --> 00:26:05,832
The 24 sheets, "Dame Sticks
Her Beautiful Head in a Lion's Mouth."

389
00:26:05,832 --> 00:26:08,829
The jaws of death! I mean, it's stupendous!

390
00:26:08,829 --> 00:26:12,825
<i>Don't you realise you'd be a chump</i>
<i>not to cash in on it? Give yourself a break.</i>

391
00:26:13,824 --> 00:26:17,820
<i>If I can't sell that act to the Big Show</i>
<i>in 10 minutes, my name ain't Flea Madigan.</i>

392
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:19,818
Tell them we can handle them cats
like nobody else.

393
00:26:20,817 --> 00:26:23,814
She's safer in that cage than in bed.
I don't doubt it.

394
00:26:27,810 --> 00:26:30,807
- Tira, I've changed my mind.
- Does it work any better?

395
00:26:31,806 --> 00:26:34,803
I've got your money.
It's a drop in the bucket to what you'll get.

396
00:26:34,803 --> 00:26:36,801
There is a Santa Claus,
but why the great joy?

397
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:41,796
We can sell the act to the Big Show.
That was a great idea you got.

398
00:26:41,796 --> 00:26:44,793
- What idea was that?
- Sticking your head in the lion's mouth!

399
00:26:44,793 --> 00:26:46,791
Who's sticking whose head in whose mouth?

400
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:51,786
You! It's marvellous, it's stupendous!
It's lousy.

401
00:26:51,786 --> 00:26:54,783
You can't back out on me.
What do you think I am, screwy?

402
00:26:54,783 --> 00:26:56,781
Sticking my head in a lion's mouth.

403
00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:58,779
Don't make me laugh, I ain't in the mood.

404
00:26:58,779 --> 00:27:00,777
He'll let you stick your hand in,
why not your head?

405
00:27:02,775 --> 00:27:04,773
You're crazy if you don't grab this chance.
It means a fortune.

406
00:27:05,772 --> 00:27:08,769
Think of it, all the dough you can use!
What is the proposition?

407
00:27:08,769 --> 00:27:11,766
The Big Show, playing big cities.
Your name in 1,000-watt Mazdas.

408
00:27:11,766 --> 00:27:14,763
<i>No more worrying, no more doubling,</i>
<i>all the clothes you want.</i>

409
00:27:14,763 --> 00:27:17,760
What good will clothes do me
without a head?

410
00:27:18,759 --> 00:27:21,756
It's a cinch for you, Tira.
Big Boy will never hurt you.

411
00:27:21,756 --> 00:27:24,753
He's young, you'll never have to use
another cat.

412
00:27:24,753 --> 00:27:26,751
The Big Show, playing in all the big cities.

413
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:29,748
The silk hats, the Rolls-Royce cars...

414
00:27:29,748 --> 00:27:32,745
the clothes, the jewels, the smart money.

415
00:27:32,745 --> 00:27:34,743
Meeting the swells, huh?

416
00:27:35,742 --> 00:27:37,740
Boys, I think you got me sold.

417
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:39,738
The only trouble with a trick like that...

418
00:27:39,738 --> 00:27:42,735
if it don't work the first time,
you don't get a second chance.

419
00:27:42,735 --> 00:27:44,733
- How much dough you got?
- A couple of grand.

420
00:27:44,733 --> 00:27:45,732
Let's have it.

421
00:27:48,729 --> 00:27:51,726
I may need more later.
Here, sign.

422
00:27:52,725 --> 00:27:54,723
What's the matter, don't you trust me?

423
00:27:54,723 --> 00:27:56,721
I wouldn't trust my own mother,
you know that.

424
00:28:03,714 --> 00:28:06,711
I'll hop that first plane
in the morning and I'll...

425
00:28:26,691 --> 00:28:29,688
Joe, open up this cage. I'm going in.

426
00:28:29,688 --> 00:28:32,685
All right.

427
00:28:33,684 --> 00:28:37,680
Now listen, honey, there's a little something
I wanna talk over with you.

428
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:40,677
Now this is what you got to do.

429
00:29:21,636 --> 00:29:25,632
- When does this lion tamer appear?
- Few minutes.

430
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:28,629
- 9:45, to be exact.
- How do you know?

431
00:29:31,626 --> 00:29:33,624
Why, it's here on the programme.

432
00:29:44,613 --> 00:29:47,610
Ladies and gentlemen...

433
00:29:47,610 --> 00:29:50,607
I take great pleasure in introducing to you...

434
00:29:51,606 --> 00:29:53,604
Tira, the million-dollar beauty!

435
00:30:55,542 --> 00:30:56,541
You see her?

436
00:31:31,506 --> 00:31:34,503
She is something special, isn't she?

437
00:31:34,503 --> 00:31:36,501
I'll say, she's fascinating.

438
00:32:09,468 --> 00:32:10,467
Where were you last night?

439
00:32:13,464 --> 00:32:14,463
Give me a peek.

440
00:32:16,461 --> 00:32:18,459
Come on, talk to me.

441
00:32:24,453 --> 00:32:25,452
Come on, get up.

442
00:32:28,449 --> 00:32:30,447
Come on, speak up for yourself.

443
00:32:32,445 --> 00:32:36,441
What's the matter with you?
You gotta be sitting? Get up.

444
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:40,437
Yeah, you'll end up as a rug.

445
00:32:42,435 --> 00:32:46,431
Come on, you're holding up the works,
you mug.

446
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:48,429
<i>Come on, get up there.</i>

447
00:32:51,426 --> 00:32:52,425
Give us a peek.

448
00:32:59,418 --> 00:33:03,414
Romeo, what's the matter with you?
Come on, get up there, that's it.

449
00:33:26,391 --> 00:33:28,389
And now, ladies and gentlemen...

450
00:33:29,388 --> 00:33:33,384
for the first time
since Nero threw the Christians to the lions...

451
00:33:35,382 --> 00:33:39,378
you will see feminine beauty,
triumphant and unafraid.

452
00:33:39,378 --> 00:33:44,373
Miss Tira will defy death
by placing her head...

453
00:33:45,372 --> 00:33:47,370
in the jaws of the king of beasts.

454
00:33:47,370 --> 00:33:49,368
Miss Tira!

455
00:34:11,346 --> 00:34:16,341
If them lions don't show some sense,
I'm going down and bite her myself.

456
00:34:18,339 --> 00:34:20,337
Come on, handsome, say, "Ah."
Come on, big guy.

457
00:34:22,335 --> 00:34:23,334
That's it.

458
00:34:29,328 --> 00:34:32,325
Remember my contract, baby.

459
00:34:54,303 --> 00:34:57,300
- That was great, wasn't it?
- I didn't see anything great about it.

460
00:34:57,300 --> 00:35:00,297
Look here, I happen to know
her publicity man.

461
00:35:00,297 --> 00:35:02,295
- How would you all like to go back...
- I'm for that.

462
00:35:02,295 --> 00:35:03,294
Oh, no.

463
00:35:03,294 --> 00:35:07,290
Let's do, Alicia. We don't care
about seeing the rest of the show, do we?

464
00:35:07,290 --> 00:35:09,288
- No.
- And it'll be a lot of fun knowing her.

465
00:35:10,287 --> 00:35:13,284
It's absurd to make such a fuss
over an ordinary circus performer.

466
00:35:13,284 --> 00:35:16,281
- Are we going, or aren't we?
- We certainly are.

467
00:35:16,281 --> 00:35:17,280
Well, let's go.

468
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,278
Very well.

469
00:35:19,278 --> 00:35:22,275
I suppose I must bow
before the general enthusiasm.

470
00:35:25,272 --> 00:35:29,268
Beulah, that's another performance
under my belt and I still got the face.

471
00:35:29,268 --> 00:35:31,266
Bless you, child,
I hopes you always keeps it.

472
00:35:31,266 --> 00:35:34,263
It's my fortune.

473
00:35:35,262 --> 00:35:38,259
When I was born with this face,
it was the same as striking oil.

474
00:35:38,259 --> 00:35:39,258
Yes, ma'am.

475
00:35:43,254 --> 00:35:46,251
You sure do believe in that horoscope,
don't you, Miss Tira?

476
00:35:46,251 --> 00:35:48,249
It tells me everything.
I wouldn't make a move without it.

477
00:35:49,248 --> 00:35:52,245
Yes, indeed, Tira enjoys meeting people.

478
00:35:52,245 --> 00:35:55,242
You'll find her a regular fellow.
She has to be in the mood.

479
00:35:55,242 --> 00:35:58,239
That is, her work is very strenuous
and stars will be temperamental at times.

480
00:36:00,237 --> 00:36:03,234
- Yes, so I've heard.
- Yes.

481
00:36:03,234 --> 00:36:04,233
Excuse me just a moment.

482
00:36:06,231 --> 00:36:07,230
See who that is.

483
00:36:10,227 --> 00:36:12,225
Evening, Mr. Madigan.
May I see Miss Tira, please?

484
00:36:12,225 --> 00:36:13,224
Yes, sir.

485
00:36:13,224 --> 00:36:15,222
Come in, Flea.

486
00:36:16,221 --> 00:36:17,220
- Are you in the mood?
- For what?

487
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:18,219
Silk hats.

488
00:36:20,217 --> 00:36:21,216
I can get that way.

489
00:36:23,214 --> 00:36:24,213
Okay, Beulah.

490
00:36:26,211 --> 00:36:28,209
Step right in, please.
Thank you.

491
00:36:28,209 --> 00:36:31,206
Just make yourself right at home.
Miss Tira'll be out directly.

492
00:36:31,206 --> 00:36:33,204
That's nice. Appreciate it.
Thank you.

493
00:36:33,204 --> 00:36:36,201
Mr. And Mrs. Fletcher, Mr. And Mrs. Bond.

494
00:36:36,201 --> 00:36:39,198
How do you do?
Mr. Lawrence and Miss Hatton.

495
00:36:39,198 --> 00:36:40,197
Pleased to meet you, won't you sit down?

496
00:36:41,196 --> 00:36:42,195
Thank you.

497
00:36:45,192 --> 00:36:46,191
Won't you sit down?

498
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:49,188
If you don't mind,
I'd rather wait in the lounge.

499
00:36:49,188 --> 00:36:51,186
Pleased to have met you, anyway.

500
00:36:58,179 --> 00:37:00,177
Now, let's see, where were we?

501
00:37:00,177 --> 00:37:04,173
I was about to say, we really came back
to tell you what a thrill you gave us.

502
00:37:04,173 --> 00:37:07,170
Thank you, I'm glad you liked my act.
It is kind of unusual.

503
00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:11,166
I don't see how you get up enough courage
to thrust your head in that beast's mouth.

504
00:37:12,165 --> 00:37:14,163
I often wonder myself.

505
00:37:14,163 --> 00:37:16,161
It seems terribly dangerous.

506
00:37:16,161 --> 00:37:19,158
It is, that's why I have to carry a rod,
I mean a gun.

507
00:37:19,158 --> 00:37:20,157
I had to shoot a lion once.

508
00:37:20,157 --> 00:37:22,155
Really, was he mad?

509
00:37:22,155 --> 00:37:25,152
He wasn't exactly pleased about it.

510
00:37:26,151 --> 00:37:28,149
Would you be so good
as to autograph my programme?

511
00:37:28,149 --> 00:37:29,148
Love to.

512
00:37:29,148 --> 00:37:32,145
I should think
you dread every new performance.

513
00:37:32,145 --> 00:37:33,144
It is kind of wearing on the nerves.

514
00:37:34,143 --> 00:37:36,141
Of course, I don't intend to do this
all my life.

515
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:38,139
- Thanks.
- And mine?

516
00:37:40,137 --> 00:37:44,133
I don't believe after all this excitement,
that you'd enjoy being idle.

517
00:37:44,133 --> 00:37:46,131
I'll be doing something.

518
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:50,127
Say, I've got a great idea.
Why don't you have supper with us?

519
00:37:50,127 --> 00:37:52,125
We'd love to have you.

520
00:37:52,125 --> 00:37:54,123
Thanks, but I've previous engagements.

521
00:37:54,123 --> 00:37:55,122
That's too bad.

522
00:37:55,122 --> 00:37:58,119
- It's been such a great pleasure to meet you.
- Thank you.

523
00:37:58,119 --> 00:38:01,116
Permit me to say,
I think you're perfectly wonderful.

524
00:38:02,115 --> 00:38:04,113
Coming from a woman,
that's a big compliment.

525
00:38:05,112 --> 00:38:06,111
Delighted.

526
00:38:06,111 --> 00:38:08,109
It's been charming to meet you lovely people.

527
00:38:08,109 --> 00:38:11,106
Have a lovely evening.
Good night.

528
00:38:15,102 --> 00:38:19,098
Anyway, you've been awfully kind.
I'll never forget you.

529
00:38:19,098 --> 00:38:20,097
No one ever does.

530
00:38:21,096 --> 00:38:23,094
- Good night.
- Good night.

531
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:26,091
Swell person, isn't she?

532
00:38:27,090 --> 00:38:29,088
I'm so glad we met her.

533
00:38:29,088 --> 00:38:31,086
How about taking a look at the lion
she works with?

534
00:38:31,086 --> 00:38:34,083
Good idea.
We'll wait for Alicia.

535
00:38:34,083 --> 00:38:36,081
Yes. We'll join you later.
Until then.

536
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:39,078
Don't be long.
All right.

537
00:38:41,076 --> 00:38:45,072
Beulah, remind me to tell Flea Madigan
to get that blue book in here...

538
00:38:45,072 --> 00:38:48,069
with the 400 in it. So I'll know who's who
and what's what in this town.

539
00:38:49,068 --> 00:38:51,066
Yes, ma'am.

540
00:38:52,065 --> 00:38:54,063
Mr. Lawrence, huh?

541
00:38:55,062 --> 00:38:58,059
Did you have a nice visit
with your lion tamer?

542
00:38:58,059 --> 00:39:01,056
Alicia, she's marvellous.
You really should've stayed.

543
00:39:01,056 --> 00:39:03,054
- Such good fun.
- Nonsense.

544
00:39:03,054 --> 00:39:06,051
I can't see why everybody's
so absolutely gaga about her.

545
00:39:06,051 --> 00:39:08,049
<i>She's obviously a person</i>
<i>of the commonest sort.</i>

546
00:39:09,048 --> 00:39:10,047
Not at all.

547
00:39:10,047 --> 00:39:12,045
Of course,
she would impress the men.

548
00:39:12,045 --> 00:39:17,040
<i>They all have low minds. And she's certainly</i>
<i>low enough to appeal to them.</i>

549
00:39:18,039 --> 00:39:19,038
Alicia, how can you say that?

550
00:39:19,038 --> 00:39:23,034
We all have a right
to our own opinion and I think she's cruel...

551
00:39:23,034 --> 00:39:24,033
and a very ill-bred person.

552
00:39:29,028 --> 00:39:30,027
I've never been so...

553
00:39:30,027 --> 00:39:32,025
I must get out of this place before I scream.

554
00:39:33,024 --> 00:39:36,021
Can you imagine that broad
discussing me in that manner?

555
00:39:38,019 --> 00:39:41,016
Say, I like them brocades.

556
00:39:41,016 --> 00:39:43,014
- Order me six more pair in the morning.
- Yes, ma'am.

557
00:39:50,007 --> 00:39:54,003
- Is you in to anyone else?
- I'm meeting all comers tonight.

558
00:39:58,998 --> 00:40:00,996
Sorry, I believe I left my cane inside.

559
00:40:02,994 --> 00:40:06,990
He says he left his cane.
Come in, Mr. Lawrence. Let's find it.

560
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:08,988
It isn't necessary, I know right where I left it.

561
00:40:09,987 --> 00:40:12,984
- You got a good memory.
- I ought to, since I left it here on purpose.

562
00:40:12,984 --> 00:40:15,981
You mean you planted that stick?
Sure.

563
00:40:15,981 --> 00:40:18,978
Had to find a way to see you alone.

564
00:40:18,978 --> 00:40:21,975
I've seen your show three times
and I think you're wonderful.

565
00:40:21,975 --> 00:40:24,972
- You're dazzling, beautiful, gorgeous...
- Wait a minute, take it slower.

566
00:40:27,969 --> 00:40:30,966
What I mean is, let's get better acquainted.

567
00:40:30,966 --> 00:40:33,963
You know, we can have a lot of fun together.
You'll like me when you know me.

568
00:40:34,962 --> 00:40:35,961
I'm not half bad.

569
00:40:35,961 --> 00:40:38,958
If you're half the man I think you are,
you'll do.

570
00:40:40,956 --> 00:40:42,954
- I am.
- Oh, well.

571
00:40:42,954 --> 00:40:45,951
Come on, let's go out tonight.
I'll ditch the crowd.

572
00:40:45,951 --> 00:40:48,948
- I told you I have a previous engagement.
- Break it.

573
00:40:48,948 --> 00:40:50,946
- You'll never regret it.
- No.

574
00:40:52,944 --> 00:40:55,941
I'd love to, but I've got to meet my aunt.

575
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:58,938
These relatives are a nuisance at times.

576
00:40:58,938 --> 00:41:01,935
What about tomorrow?
For breakfast, lunch, dinner, anything.

577
00:41:01,935 --> 00:41:03,933
Let me see.

578
00:41:03,933 --> 00:41:06,930
Breakfast I have in bed, so that's out.

579
00:41:06,930 --> 00:41:09,927
I don't eat lunch, and dinner...

580
00:41:09,927 --> 00:41:11,925
We'll make it supper tomorrow night.

581
00:41:12,924 --> 00:41:14,922
That's a date, then we'll go out.

582
00:41:14,922 --> 00:41:17,919
I like sophisticated men to take me out.

583
00:41:17,919 --> 00:41:20,916
I'm not really sophisticated.

584
00:41:21,915 --> 00:41:23,913
You're not really out yet, either.

585
00:41:29,907 --> 00:41:31,905
You got me.

586
00:41:32,904 --> 00:41:33,903
Have I?

587
00:41:34,902 --> 00:41:37,899
I guess I'd better be going
before they come in here and get me.

588
00:41:37,899 --> 00:41:40,896
- Tomorrow night, then.
- That's the night.

589
00:41:43,893 --> 00:41:46,890
Beulah, bring me my horoscope.

590
00:41:46,890 --> 00:41:49,887
- Here it is.
- That's service.

591
00:41:49,887 --> 00:41:51,885
That man sure is crazy about you, ain't he?

592
00:41:51,885 --> 00:41:54,882
Crazy about me?
The guy's a pushover for me.

593
00:42:06,870 --> 00:42:09,867
Thank you, Mr. Lawrence.
That will be delivered to Miss Tira today.

594
00:42:15,861 --> 00:42:17,859
We will deliver the card to Miss Tira
on Wednesday.

595
00:42:18,858 --> 00:42:22,854
All right, Miss Tira,
Mr. Lawrence has arranged for the account.

596
00:42:22,854 --> 00:42:24,852
Yeah? Now let me see.

597
00:42:28,848 --> 00:42:31,845
My, oh, my! Look at that.

598
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:39,777
<i>I always love to be in bright lights</i>

599
00:43:39,777 --> 00:43:41,775
<i>My streets are paved with gold</i>

600
00:43:43,773 --> 00:43:45,771
<i>I found myself a new kind of man</i>

601
00:43:45,771 --> 00:43:46,770
Sing it, honey.

602
00:43:47,769 --> 00:43:48,768
<i>He's mine to have and hold</i>

603
00:43:48,768 --> 00:43:49,767
And how.

604
00:43:49,767 --> 00:43:51,765
<i>I'm in my glory when he's around</i>

605
00:43:51,765 --> 00:43:52,764
Yes, ma'am.

606
00:43:53,763 --> 00:43:55,761
<i>Found a new way to go to town</i>

607
00:43:58,758 --> 00:44:01,755
- Miss Tira, you got something.
- Something not bad, huh?

608
00:44:02,754 --> 00:44:03,753
Not bad?

609
00:44:03,753 --> 00:44:06,750
I've never seen such presents as this here
Mr. Kirk Lawrence done give you.

610
00:44:07,749 --> 00:44:10,746
You sure skinned him pretty.
You only knowed him a week.

611
00:44:10,746 --> 00:44:12,744
Yeah, but what a week!

612
00:44:13,743 --> 00:44:15,741
He's crazy about you, same as all the rest.

613
00:44:15,741 --> 00:44:17,739
I don't see how any man
could help loving you.

614
00:44:18,738 --> 00:44:20,736
I don't give them any help,
they do it themselves.

615
00:44:21,735 --> 00:44:24,732
You do keep me busy
keeping track of your gentleman friends.

616
00:44:24,732 --> 00:44:26,730
I want to make it easy for you, Beulah...

617
00:44:26,730 --> 00:44:28,728
I'm thinking about putting in a filing system.

618
00:44:30,726 --> 00:44:31,725
Yes, ma'am.

619
00:44:31,725 --> 00:44:33,723
Men don't mean a thing to me.

620
00:44:34,722 --> 00:44:35,721
Be careful with that million-dollar foot.

621
00:44:35,721 --> 00:44:39,717
I don't know, but me and men
do pretty well together.

622
00:44:39,717 --> 00:44:41,715
What kind of men do you like, Libby?

623
00:44:41,715 --> 00:44:43,713
I'm just crazy about dark men.

624
00:44:44,712 --> 00:44:47,709
Dark men?
You ought to have a big time in Africa.

625
00:44:47,709 --> 00:44:49,707
Yes, ma'am.

626
00:44:49,707 --> 00:44:52,704
Don't get those nails too short,
or they'll think I bite them.

627
00:44:52,704 --> 00:44:57,699
Miss Tira, I've been under the impression
you is a one-man woman.

628
00:44:58,698 --> 00:45:00,696
I am, one man at a time.

629
00:45:01,695 --> 00:45:02,694
Beulah.
Yes, ma'am.

630
00:45:02,694 --> 00:45:04,692
Fetch me that importation.

631
00:45:04,692 --> 00:45:06,690
You mean this one?

632
00:45:06,690 --> 00:45:08,688
Yes, that Parisian one.
Yes, ma'am.

633
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:19,677
<i>I play to win the game of romance</i>

634
00:45:20,676 --> 00:45:23,673
<i>With high cards in my hands</i>

635
00:45:23,673 --> 00:45:26,670
<i>But I've been trumped by an ace of hearts</i>

636
00:45:26,670 --> 00:45:29,667
<i>That feeling's oh, so grand</i>

637
00:45:29,667 --> 00:45:32,664
<i>Give me my parasols and fancy gowns</i>

638
00:45:32,664 --> 00:45:34,662
<i>I found a new way to go to town</i>

639
00:45:35,661 --> 00:45:36,660
<i>I'm high</i>

640
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:37,659
Yes, ma'am.

641
00:45:37,659 --> 00:45:38,658
<i>I'm low</i>

642
00:45:38,658 --> 00:45:39,657
<i>Takes a good man to break me</i>

643
00:45:39,657 --> 00:45:40,656
Sure does.

644
00:45:40,656 --> 00:45:42,654
<i>No man can shake me</i>

645
00:45:42,654 --> 00:45:43,653
<i>Until I let him go</i>

646
00:45:45,651 --> 00:45:46,650
<i>Oh de lum</i>

647
00:45:46,650 --> 00:45:47,649
Come on.

648
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:59,637
Is it a flash or is it a flash?
That's beautiful.

649
00:45:59,637 --> 00:46:02,634
I know it's beautiful,
but I'm asking you is it a flash?

650
00:46:02,634 --> 00:46:03,633
It's a flash, all right.

651
00:46:03,633 --> 00:46:05,631
- Kind of daring, huh?
- Not for you, it ain't.

652
00:46:05,631 --> 00:46:07,629
That's all I want to know.

653
00:46:10,626 --> 00:46:13,623
If that's that house detective, tell him I'm...

654
00:46:13,623 --> 00:46:16,620
I never will get used to this joint.

655
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:17,619
- Show the gentleman in.
- Yes, ma'am.

656
00:46:17,619 --> 00:46:18,618
Get me my beads.

657
00:46:19,617 --> 00:46:21,615
You mean that pretty necklace
you just had give to you?

658
00:46:21,615 --> 00:46:23,613
Yeah, the necklace. I will say beads.

659
00:46:25,611 --> 00:46:27,609
- Pretty, ain't it?
- I'll say it is.

660
00:46:27,609 --> 00:46:29,607
I just wonder how much money that costs?

661
00:46:29,607 --> 00:46:31,605
I couldn't tell you right now,
but I have an idea...

662
00:46:31,605 --> 00:46:35,601
It ain't no he, it's a she.
Says her name is Miss Hatton.

663
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:38,598
- Miss who?
- Miss Hatton.

664
00:46:41,595 --> 00:46:43,593
- Pardon me.
- Yes, ma'am.

665
00:46:48,588 --> 00:46:49,587
So it's you.

666
00:46:50,586 --> 00:46:51,585
You know why I'm here.

667
00:46:51,585 --> 00:46:54,582
Hardly. You see I'm a lion tamer,
not a mind reader.

668
00:46:54,582 --> 00:46:58,578
Then it might refresh you to know
that I'm Kirk's fiance.

669
00:46:59,577 --> 00:47:01,575
Nothing refreshing about that.

670
00:47:01,575 --> 00:47:04,572
- I want to know just what you intend to do.
- What do you mean?

671
00:47:04,572 --> 00:47:06,570
You know you're making a fool of him.

672
00:47:06,570 --> 00:47:10,566
He ain't any different than
when I first met him, not much.

673
00:47:10,566 --> 00:47:13,563
Everyone knows we're engaged
and yet you're deliberately interfering.

674
00:47:13,563 --> 00:47:15,561
I ain't interfering with nothing.

675
00:47:15,561 --> 00:47:19,557
- If Kirk prefers my company to yours...
- No, he doesn't, he only imagines he does.

676
00:47:19,557 --> 00:47:21,555
I'll admit the boy has got a great imagination.

677
00:47:23,553 --> 00:47:26,550
It's perfectly obvious
what your intentions are.

678
00:47:26,550 --> 00:47:27,549
<i>Kirk has lots of money...</i>

679
00:47:27,549 --> 00:47:30,546
Wait a minute.
Whatever you're thinking, you're wrong.

680
00:47:30,546 --> 00:47:34,542
I only like him like a brother.
You ain't got nothing to worry about.

681
00:47:34,542 --> 00:47:36,540
- You're a liar!
- Say, listen you...

682
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:38,538
a better dame than you
once called me a liar...

683
00:47:38,538 --> 00:47:41,535
and they had a sew her up
in 12 different places.

684
00:47:41,535 --> 00:47:44,532
You're lucky I'm a little more refined
than I used to be.

685
00:47:45,531 --> 00:47:47,529
And if you were as much a lady as I am...

686
00:47:47,529 --> 00:47:49,527
you'd get out of here before I get real sore.

687
00:47:49,527 --> 00:47:53,523
- You haven't a streak of decency in you.
- I don't show my good points to strangers.

688
00:47:55,521 --> 00:47:56,520
I'll trouble you to scram.

689
00:47:59,517 --> 00:48:01,515
Just a minute.

690
00:48:01,515 --> 00:48:06,510
I realise there's only one thing
that will influence you to leave Kirk alone.

691
00:48:06,510 --> 00:48:08,508
How much?

692
00:48:18,498 --> 00:48:20,496
Beulah.
Yes, ma'am.

693
00:48:20,496 --> 00:48:21,495
Peel me a grape.

694
00:48:25,491 --> 00:48:27,489
I can't wait any longer.
You'd better go.

695
00:48:27,489 --> 00:48:30,486
- I'm not going to Texas. That's final.
- You're being ridiculous.

696
00:48:30,486 --> 00:48:33,483
This mad infatuation of yours for this...

697
00:48:33,483 --> 00:48:35,481
lion tamer, will ruin your life
and Alicia's, too.

698
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:38,478
Don't you worry about Alicia.

699
00:48:38,478 --> 00:48:40,476
You seem to forget
that you're an engaged man.

700
00:48:40,476 --> 00:48:43,473
Jack, it's no good arguing.
I'll handle my own affairs.

701
00:48:43,473 --> 00:48:45,471
- You're gonna continue with this woman?
- Indefinitely.

702
00:48:46,470 --> 00:48:47,469
- You're mad.
- Right.

703
00:49:01,455 --> 00:49:03,453
Leave that where you found it.

704
00:49:03,453 --> 00:49:06,450
Well, hello, baby.

705
00:49:06,450 --> 00:49:07,449
Here I am.
So I see.

706
00:49:08,448 --> 00:49:10,446
When'd did they open
the pearly gates for you?

707
00:49:10,446 --> 00:49:11,445
Yesterday. Glad to see me?

708
00:49:11,445 --> 00:49:13,443
Sure, don't I look it?

709
00:49:13,443 --> 00:49:15,441
- And you ain't sore.
- Why should I be?

710
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:18,438
You've done the time, not me.

711
00:49:18,438 --> 00:49:20,436
How did you happen to come up here?

712
00:49:20,436 --> 00:49:22,434
The show was laying off this week,
so I looks up Barton.

713
00:49:22,434 --> 00:49:24,432
He tells me what a swell joint you got here.

714
00:49:25,431 --> 00:49:29,427
You've done pretty nice for yourself.
From a tent to a penthouse.

715
00:49:32,424 --> 00:49:35,421
Yeah, this is a great layout.

716
00:49:35,421 --> 00:49:38,418
This is one place
you ain't laying out in, honey.

717
00:49:39,417 --> 00:49:42,414
I guess that sort of means
I don't exactly fit in around here.

718
00:49:42,414 --> 00:49:44,412
I wouldn't say that.

719
00:49:44,412 --> 00:49:46,410
The whole trouble with you,
you got nervous fingers.

720
00:49:47,409 --> 00:49:49,407
I'm all washed up with that.

721
00:49:49,407 --> 00:49:51,405
What are you figuring on doing for a living?

722
00:49:51,405 --> 00:49:55,401
I don't know. I'm sort of up against it.
I thought maybe you might...

723
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:57,399
Pulling the sob on me?

724
00:49:57,399 --> 00:49:58,398
No, I...

725
00:49:58,398 --> 00:50:00,396
I'll do something for you...

726
00:50:00,396 --> 00:50:02,394
if you promise to keep your hands
in your own pockets.

727
00:50:02,394 --> 00:50:05,391
- Baby, I'd promise you anything.
- But would you keep it?

728
00:50:05,391 --> 00:50:08,388
- Do you want me to swear?
- Never mind, I can do that myself.

729
00:50:08,388 --> 00:50:12,384
Listen, go see Barton. Tell him I said
to find something for you to do over there.

730
00:50:13,383 --> 00:50:16,380
And here, take this.
But don't make a habit of it.

731
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:19,377
Get yourself some clothes
so you start looking normal again.

732
00:50:19,377 --> 00:50:20,376
Say, you're a pal.

733
00:50:21,375 --> 00:50:24,372
- You know there never was a dame like you.
- Forget that.

734
00:50:24,372 --> 00:50:27,369
Okay, but I just want you to know
I'm still warm for you, baby.

735
00:50:27,369 --> 00:50:30,366
- Maybe I'll be seeing you.
- Make it soon, will you?

736
00:50:31,365 --> 00:50:32,364
Get going.

737
00:50:34,362 --> 00:50:37,359
That guy would show up now.

738
00:50:39,357 --> 00:50:41,355
Excuse me.

739
00:50:48,348 --> 00:50:50,346
- Miss Tira's apartment?
- Yes, sir.

740
00:50:50,346 --> 00:50:54,342
Just say if she can spare the time,
Mr. Clayton would like to see her.

741
00:50:54,342 --> 00:50:57,339
I will if I can remember it,
if not, I'll just say he's here.

742
00:50:57,339 --> 00:50:59,337
Perhaps that will do as well.

743
00:50:59,337 --> 00:51:03,333
Take the gentleman's hat and coat.
Thanks.

744
00:51:04,332 --> 00:51:05,331
I hope I haven't disturbed you.

745
00:51:05,331 --> 00:51:07,329
Not so far.

746
00:51:09,327 --> 00:51:11,325
Anything I can do for you?

747
00:51:11,325 --> 00:51:14,322
Yes, there is,
but first I better introduce myself.

748
00:51:14,322 --> 00:51:17,319
That's not necessary, I know who you are.

749
00:51:17,319 --> 00:51:19,317
I've heard Kirk speak of you.

750
00:51:19,317 --> 00:51:21,315
Good, that simplifies matters.

751
00:51:21,315 --> 00:51:23,313
It's on Kirk's account I'm here.

752
00:51:23,313 --> 00:51:25,311
I see.

753
00:51:28,308 --> 00:51:31,305
Let's sit down and be comfortable about it.

754
00:51:35,301 --> 00:51:37,299
I hope I can come right to the point.

755
00:51:37,299 --> 00:51:39,297
About this situation between you and Kirk...

756
00:51:39,297 --> 00:51:42,294
he's neglecting important business
on your account.

757
00:51:42,294 --> 00:51:45,291
And there's Miss Hatton, his fiance,
to be considered.

758
00:51:45,291 --> 00:51:47,289
She's a novel twist.

759
00:51:49,287 --> 00:51:51,285
Of course, I know you have no liking
for Miss Hatton.

760
00:51:51,285 --> 00:51:54,282
She came in here, got nasty,
I had to put her in her place.

761
00:51:54,282 --> 00:51:57,279
Yes, I heard you had
some slight misunderstanding.

762
00:51:59,277 --> 00:52:00,276
Do you mind if I get personal?

763
00:52:00,276 --> 00:52:03,273
Go right ahead.
I don't mind if you get familiar.

764
00:52:04,272 --> 00:52:06,270
It's all in the family.

765
00:52:06,270 --> 00:52:10,266
Well, then, do you really care for Kirk?
I mean, do you love him?

766
00:52:11,265 --> 00:52:13,263
I don't know. See, my horoscope says so.

767
00:52:15,261 --> 00:52:16,260
I'm afraid I don't understand.

768
00:52:17,259 --> 00:52:19,257
I'm afraid
I don't understand it myself sometimes.

769
00:52:20,256 --> 00:52:23,253
You see, it describes a guy,
I mean, a man like Kirk.

770
00:52:24,252 --> 00:52:26,250
Surely you're not being serious.

771
00:52:26,250 --> 00:52:29,247
Why, I certainly am.
My whole life is ruled by astrology.

772
00:52:30,246 --> 00:52:31,245
Well...

773
00:52:33,243 --> 00:52:35,241
What colour eyes have you got?

774
00:52:38,238 --> 00:52:39,237
I don't know.

775
00:52:41,235 --> 00:52:42,234
Fine.

776
00:52:43,233 --> 00:52:45,231
Well, as you were saying...

777
00:52:47,229 --> 00:52:51,225
You're telling me simply because Kirk fits
some description in your horoscope...

778
00:52:51,225 --> 00:52:54,222
that you'd deliberately break up things
between him and Miss Hatton?

779
00:52:54,222 --> 00:52:56,220
Maybe it would be a good break for him.

780
00:52:56,220 --> 00:53:00,216
Surely you wouldn't let personal dislike
destroy their engagement.

781
00:53:00,216 --> 00:53:02,214
Unless, of course,
you have serious intentions.

782
00:53:02,214 --> 00:53:04,212
What if I have?

783
00:53:05,211 --> 00:53:07,209
I'm afraid that's impossible.

784
00:53:07,209 --> 00:53:11,205
Listen, with me nothing is impossible.

785
00:53:12,204 --> 00:53:13,203
That may be.

786
00:53:13,203 --> 00:53:17,199
But I'm here to tell you, if you're thinking
of marrying Kirk, you better not count on it.

787
00:53:17,199 --> 00:53:21,195
Kirk sent you up here with that line?
He doesn't know I'm here.

788
00:53:21,195 --> 00:53:25,191
I get it. You figure the family honour
needs protecting.

789
00:53:25,191 --> 00:53:29,187
A circus dame would be sort of
a red leaf on the family tree, is that it?

790
00:53:30,186 --> 00:53:32,184
Please understand
that it's been difficult for me...

791
00:53:33,183 --> 00:53:37,179
to come here and talk to you about what you
no doubt consider is none of my business.

792
00:53:37,179 --> 00:53:38,178
That's all right, I don't care.

793
00:53:38,178 --> 00:53:42,174
If someone's got something on their mind,
I like them to get it off.

794
00:53:42,174 --> 00:53:46,170
- You're an unusual sort of person.
- I've been accused of that.

795
00:53:46,170 --> 00:53:50,166
As a matter of fact, I'd much rather have
met you under pleasanter circumstances.

796
00:53:50,166 --> 00:53:53,163
Same here, there's no hard feelings.

797
00:53:53,163 --> 00:53:56,160
Of course not. I shouldn't want you
to feel unfriendly toward me.

798
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:59,157
I shouldn't want you to get the impression
that I'm just an adventuress.

799
00:53:59,157 --> 00:54:02,154
- I didn't think that.
- What did you think?

800
00:54:02,154 --> 00:54:05,151
I had no definite idea
what you would be like.

801
00:54:05,151 --> 00:54:06,150
I've seen newspaper pictures of you.

802
00:54:06,150 --> 00:54:09,147
Yeah? Ever seen this one here?

803
00:54:09,147 --> 00:54:11,145
There's one of my favourites.

804
00:54:13,143 --> 00:54:16,140
- It looks just like you.
- It should, I posed for it.

805
00:54:19,137 --> 00:54:20,136
- You like it?
- Yes.

806
00:54:20,136 --> 00:54:21,135
You can have it.

807
00:54:22,134 --> 00:54:24,132
No, thanks, I wouldn't want to deprive you...

808
00:54:24,132 --> 00:54:28,128
It's all right, I get them by the hundreds,
frame and all.

809
00:54:28,128 --> 00:54:29,127
Well, in that case...

810
00:54:30,126 --> 00:54:32,124
Won't you stay? I'll ring for tea.

811
00:54:32,124 --> 00:54:35,121
No, thanks, really, I must be going.
You've been wonderful.

812
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:38,118
You've been kind of wonderful yourself.

813
00:54:40,116 --> 00:54:41,115
Thank you.

814
00:54:48,108 --> 00:54:52,104
Now you'll consider all I've said
and try and bring Kirk to his senses.

815
00:54:53,103 --> 00:54:55,101
I can't promise anything right now, but...

816
00:54:56,100 --> 00:54:59,097
you have started a new train of thought
in my mind.

817
00:54:59,097 --> 00:55:02,094
I'll think it over and let you know
what I decide.

818
00:55:02,094 --> 00:55:05,091
- You'd be doing a fine thing.
- Yeah? Fine for who?

819
00:55:06,090 --> 00:55:08,088
For all of us.

820
00:55:08,088 --> 00:55:11,085
You're kind of unusual yourself.

821
00:55:11,085 --> 00:55:13,083
I've been accused of that.

822
00:55:15,081 --> 00:55:17,079
Now you can reach me there at any time.

823
00:55:17,079 --> 00:55:20,076
And I want to thank you
for the way you received me.

824
00:55:20,076 --> 00:55:22,074
And you can reach me there at any time.

825
00:55:24,072 --> 00:55:26,070
You'll hear from me.

826
00:55:29,067 --> 00:55:31,065
That will be fine.

827
00:55:32,064 --> 00:55:35,061
You fascinate me. You'd better go.

828
00:55:37,059 --> 00:55:38,058
Good night.

829
00:56:01,035 --> 00:56:03,033
Hello.
<i>Miss Tira calling.</i>

830
00:56:03,033 --> 00:56:04,032
Good. Put her on.

831
00:56:06,030 --> 00:56:07,029
Mr. Clayton?

832
00:56:08,028 --> 00:56:10,026
I've been thinking over
everything you said and...

833
00:56:11,025 --> 00:56:12,024
I've made my decision.

834
00:56:12,024 --> 00:56:14,022
Good. I'm glad you made up
your mind quickly.

835
00:56:14,022 --> 00:56:16,020
I'm very quick in a slow way.

836
00:56:19,017 --> 00:56:22,014
You see I can't discuss it over the phone.

837
00:56:22,014 --> 00:56:24,012
It's got a lot of angles to it.

838
00:56:24,012 --> 00:56:26,010
You better come up and see me.

839
00:56:27,009 --> 00:56:28,008
I'll be glad to.

840
00:56:28,008 --> 00:56:31,005
In fact, I'll come over right away
if it's convenient for you.

841
00:56:31,005 --> 00:56:33,003
Most convenient.

842
00:56:33,003 --> 00:56:35,001
I'll tell you this much...

843
00:56:35,001 --> 00:56:36,999
you're gonna like what I got in mind.

844
00:56:38,997 --> 00:56:39,996
I'll be ready.

845
00:56:40,995 --> 00:56:41,994
Goodbye.

846
00:57:10,965 --> 00:57:12,963
- Hello, honey.
- Good evening, Miss Tira.

847
00:57:12,963 --> 00:57:15,960
If anyone should call, I'm indisposed.

848
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:16,959
Yes, ma'am.

849
00:57:17,958 --> 00:57:20,955
You know what I mean, don't you?
Yes, ma'am.

850
00:57:21,954 --> 00:57:22,953
Come here, dear.

851
00:57:22,953 --> 00:57:25,950
I haven't had you alone all evening
with all those people.

852
00:57:25,950 --> 00:57:27,948
My public.

853
00:57:30,945 --> 00:57:32,943
Let me take a good look at you.

854
00:57:35,940 --> 00:57:37,938
You were wonderful tonight.

855
00:57:37,938 --> 00:57:40,935
I'm always wonderful at night.

856
00:57:40,935 --> 00:57:42,933
Yes, but tonight you were especially good.

857
00:57:42,933 --> 00:57:44,931
When I'm good, I'm very good.

858
00:57:44,931 --> 00:57:46,929
But when I'm bad...

859
00:57:46,929 --> 00:57:47,928
I'm better.

860
00:57:49,926 --> 00:57:51,924
Don't go away, I'll be right back.

861
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:58,917
<i>No one loves me</i>
<i>like that New York man</i>

862
00:57:58,917 --> 00:58:00,915
You must've had a good time,
you seem so happy.

863
00:58:00,915 --> 00:58:03,912
If I wasn't, you'd know it.
Get me another gown, Beulah.

864
00:58:03,912 --> 00:58:06,909
I've danced this one around all evening.
I gotta give it a rest.

865
00:58:06,909 --> 00:58:07,908
Yes, ma'am. Which one?

866
00:58:07,908 --> 00:58:09,906
- That lucky one.
- Yes, ma'am.

867
00:58:45,870 --> 00:58:49,866
- That guy's got rhythm, eh?
- Yes, I know what you means.

868
00:59:00,855 --> 00:59:03,852
Bring out a couple of drinks
and then you two dames can retire.

869
00:59:04,851 --> 00:59:06,849
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

870
00:59:06,849 --> 00:59:07,848
Open up that door.

871
00:59:09,846 --> 00:59:11,844
Here goes my big moment.

872
00:59:18,837 --> 00:59:21,834
Don't stop, honey, you put me in the mood.

873
00:59:21,834 --> 00:59:24,831
It's good to be here alone with you, dear.

874
00:59:24,831 --> 00:59:26,829
I kind of like it, too.

875
00:59:27,828 --> 00:59:30,825
The only thing I've got to be jealous.

876
00:59:30,825 --> 00:59:33,822
- Of course, if I could only trust you.
- You can, hundreds have.

877
00:59:37,818 --> 00:59:39,816
Do you know I'm mad about you?

878
00:59:39,816 --> 00:59:42,813
I could tell you'd be, the first time I saw you.

879
00:59:43,812 --> 00:59:45,810
Say, I must be transparent.

880
00:59:45,810 --> 00:59:48,807
Honey, you're just wrapped in cellophane.

881
00:59:49,806 --> 00:59:50,805
Come on, darling.

882
00:59:50,805 --> 00:59:52,803
- Be serious.
- You want me to?

883
00:59:52,803 --> 00:59:55,800
- Sure I do.
- All right, now I'm very serious.

884
00:59:58,797 --> 00:59:59,796
I adore you.

885
01:00:01,794 --> 01:00:03,792
Yes, ma'am.

886
01:00:03,792 --> 01:00:05,790
How am I doing, Beulah?

887
01:00:05,790 --> 01:00:08,787
You're doing fine, you're doing grand.

888
01:00:09,786 --> 01:00:11,784
I'll do better when you are gone,
you rascal, you!

889
01:00:12,783 --> 01:00:14,781
Yes, ma'am,
I know you will, ma'am.

890
01:00:22,773 --> 01:00:23,772
Great gals, huh?

891
01:00:26,769 --> 01:00:29,766
Honey, I wonder if you realise
just how much you mean to me.

892
01:00:30,765 --> 01:00:33,762
- I've never been so happy in my life.
- You mean that?

893
01:00:33,762 --> 01:00:35,760
I guess love is a wonderful thing.

894
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:37,758
Yes, I've heard it highly praised.

895
01:00:38,757 --> 01:00:43,752
<i>No one could be</i>
<i>half as nice as you</i>

896
01:00:48,747 --> 01:00:51,744
<i>What have you done to me</i>

897
01:00:51,744 --> 01:00:55,740
<i>You're simply grand</i>

898
01:00:55,740 --> 01:00:58,737
<i>You worked your spell on me</i>

899
01:00:59,736 --> 01:01:02,733
<i>So make your demand</i>

900
01:01:02,733 --> 01:01:06,729
<i>I want you, I need you</i>

901
01:01:07,728 --> 01:01:10,725
<i>Your love must be mine</i>
<i>oh, baby, baby</i>

902
01:01:11,724 --> 01:01:16,719
<i>To have you would be paradise divine</i>

903
01:01:16,719 --> 01:01:19,716
- Move over, honey, and don't stop.
- I'll never stop.

904
01:01:19,716 --> 01:01:22,713
<i>Want you, need you</i>

905
01:01:23,712 --> 01:01:25,710
<i>To call you my own</i>

906
01:01:26,709 --> 01:01:28,707
<i>To have you would be</i>

907
01:01:29,706 --> 01:01:31,704
<i>paradise I know</i>

908
01:01:32,703 --> 01:01:34,701
<i>Please won't you believe me</i>

909
01:01:35,700 --> 01:01:38,697
Darling, you can never guess
how much I love you.

910
01:01:38,697 --> 01:01:40,695
I'll never guess, you've got to you show me.

911
01:01:40,695 --> 01:01:43,692
- Just give me the chance.
- You'll get it.

912
01:01:43,692 --> 01:01:44,691
<i>To have you</i>

913
01:01:44,691 --> 01:01:47,688
I could be your slave.

914
01:01:47,688 --> 01:01:49,686
I guess that could be arranged.

915
01:01:50,685 --> 01:01:53,682
<i>What have you done to me?</i>

916
01:01:54,681 --> 01:01:57,678
<i>You're simply grand</i>

917
01:01:57,678 --> 01:01:58,677
What have you done to me?

918
01:01:59,676 --> 01:02:01,674
You ought to know.

919
01:02:03,672 --> 01:02:06,669
<i>So make your demand</i>

920
01:02:06,669 --> 01:02:09,666
<i>I want you, need you</i>

921
01:02:10,665 --> 01:02:13,662
<i>Your love must be mine</i>
<i>oh, baby, baby</i>

922
01:02:14,661 --> 01:02:17,658
<i>To have you would be paradise</i>

923
01:02:19,656 --> 01:02:20,655
What are you gonna do about it?

924
01:02:37,638 --> 01:02:40,635
What's this in the paper
about you marrying this rich guy, Clayton?

925
01:02:40,635 --> 01:02:43,632
If it's publicity it's great,
and if it ain't, it's no good.

926
01:02:43,632 --> 01:02:45,630
I'm quitting the show.

927
01:02:45,630 --> 01:02:47,628
- You're quitting?
- Yeah, I'm sick of this racket.

928
01:02:49,626 --> 01:02:51,624
I found the right man, I'm gonna get married.

929
01:02:51,624 --> 01:02:53,622
You can't quit.

930
01:02:53,622 --> 01:02:56,619
- You got a five year contract with me.
- Yeah?

931
01:02:56,619 --> 01:02:57,618
Did you ever read it?

932
01:02:57,618 --> 01:03:00,615
It says for a good cause
you could give a two week's notice.

933
01:03:00,615 --> 01:03:03,612
- I'm giving you that notice now.
- But you ain't got no good cause.

934
01:03:03,612 --> 01:03:05,610
Marriage is a good enough cause
for anything.

935
01:03:05,610 --> 01:03:08,607
You can't do that to me
and get away with it.

936
01:03:08,607 --> 01:03:09,606
No?

937
01:03:18,597 --> 01:03:20,595
What's my picture doing by that skunk?

938
01:03:20,595 --> 01:03:22,593
I figured it belonged there.

939
01:03:22,593 --> 01:03:24,591
What do you mean?
Everybody used to call me "The Bull."

940
01:03:24,591 --> 01:03:28,587
You may be the bull to them,
but you're just plain skunk to me.

941
01:03:31,584 --> 01:03:32,583
I got everything set.

942
01:03:32,583 --> 01:03:35,580
<i>You get to the apartment</i>
<i>and see everything's clear.</i>

943
01:03:35,580 --> 01:03:36,579
All right.

944
01:03:37,578 --> 01:03:39,576
But suppose Tira gets back
before we spring it.

945
01:03:39,576 --> 01:03:40,575
I got the chauffer fixed...

946
01:03:41,574 --> 01:03:43,572
so there'll be trouble with the car
on the road.

947
01:03:43,572 --> 01:03:45,570
Now, get going. Every minute counts.

948
01:03:49,566 --> 01:03:52,563
Can't you hurry and get that thing fixed,
I gotta get back.

949
01:03:52,563 --> 01:03:54,561
I'm expecting Mr. Clayton at the apartment.

950
01:03:54,561 --> 01:03:56,559
Doing the best I can, ma'am.

951
01:03:56,559 --> 01:03:57,558
Your best is no good, try your worst.

952
01:03:57,558 --> 01:03:58,557
Yes, ma'am.

953
01:03:59,556 --> 01:04:01,554
Say, where are we?
I thought we were in Jersey.

954
01:04:02,553 --> 01:04:04,551
We're in Jersey, ma'am.

955
01:04:04,551 --> 01:04:07,548
You sure you didn't take
the wrong road and land in Brazil?

956
01:04:07,548 --> 01:04:08,547
No, ma'am.

957
01:04:10,545 --> 01:04:11,544
Come on.

958
01:04:12,543 --> 01:04:13,542
Yes, ma'am.

959
01:04:37,518 --> 01:04:38,517
Tira.

960
01:04:41,514 --> 01:04:42,513
What do you want?

961
01:04:46,509 --> 01:04:48,507
You're Clayton.

962
01:04:48,507 --> 01:04:50,505
I know all about you and Tira.

963
01:04:51,504 --> 01:04:53,502
But that's all finished.

964
01:04:53,502 --> 01:04:57,498
I've been away, but I'm back again
and she ain't wanting no change.

965
01:04:57,498 --> 01:04:59,496
We're going on just the same as before.

966
01:05:00,495 --> 01:05:02,493
- Get it?
- No, I don't get it.

967
01:05:02,493 --> 01:05:04,491
- Where's Miss Tira?
- She ain't here now.

968
01:05:04,491 --> 01:05:06,489
She knew you was coming
and she didn't want to see you.

969
01:05:06,489 --> 01:05:08,487
What're you talking about?

970
01:05:08,487 --> 01:05:12,483
She didn't like to tell you herself,
so I'm doing it for her.

971
01:05:12,483 --> 01:05:13,482
<i>Ain't that enough?</i>

972
01:05:16,479 --> 01:05:17,478
Yes, I guess that's enough.

973
01:05:24,471 --> 01:05:26,469
This is the right thing to do, Jack.

974
01:05:26,469 --> 01:05:29,466
With a woman of her type,
this would have happened sooner or later.

975
01:05:29,466 --> 01:05:31,464
If you ask me, I think you're lucky.

976
01:05:31,464 --> 01:05:33,462
Maybe you are right.

977
01:05:35,460 --> 01:05:38,457
Frank, get a messenger
and send that at once, will you?

978
01:05:39,456 --> 01:05:41,454
I'm gonna be out of town
for three or four weeks.

979
01:05:41,454 --> 01:05:44,451
In the meantime, I'm out to all callers.
Everybody, understand?

980
01:05:44,451 --> 01:05:46,449
Is that message for Miss Tira, too?

981
01:05:47,448 --> 01:05:48,447
Yes.

982
01:05:48,447 --> 01:05:51,444
But I understood
you were to be married this month.

983
01:05:52,443 --> 01:05:53,442
We're both mistaken.

984
01:05:54,441 --> 01:05:55,440
Yes, sir.

985
01:05:58,437 --> 01:06:00,435
<i>What have you done to me</i>

986
01:06:00,435 --> 01:06:03,432
<i>You're simply grand</i>

987
01:06:04,431 --> 01:06:07,428
<i>You worked your spell on me</i>

988
01:06:07,428 --> 01:06:09,426
<i>So make your demand</i>

989
01:06:10,425 --> 01:06:13,422
<i>I want you, I need you</i>

990
01:06:13,422 --> 01:06:15,420
<i>Your love must be mine</i>

991
01:06:15,420 --> 01:06:18,417
You sure gonna make a gorgeous bride.

992
01:06:18,417 --> 01:06:21,414
I know I'm gonna make a nervous bride.

993
01:06:21,414 --> 01:06:23,412
I ain't never done this before.

994
01:06:23,412 --> 01:06:25,410
Marriage is a new kind of racket for me.

995
01:06:25,410 --> 01:06:27,408
I've been married four times.

996
01:06:29,406 --> 01:06:32,403
You ought to do well
in the wholesale business.

997
01:06:34,401 --> 01:06:36,399
I don't wanna see anyone but Mr. Clayton.

998
01:06:36,399 --> 01:06:37,398
Yes, ma'am.

999
01:06:38,397 --> 01:06:41,394
That Mr. Clayton is sure a wonderful man.

1000
01:06:41,394 --> 01:06:42,393
I'll say he is.

1001
01:06:43,392 --> 01:06:46,389
I never knew I could go for anyone
like I have for him.

1002
01:06:46,389 --> 01:06:48,387
He made me feel like a different dame.

1003
01:06:48,387 --> 01:06:50,385
I ain't just a "Sister Honky Tonk" no more.

1004
01:06:52,383 --> 01:06:53,382
You're a lady now.

1005
01:06:53,382 --> 01:06:54,381
Thank you.

1006
01:06:55,380 --> 01:06:57,378
Some messenger gave me
this note to give you, Miss Tira.

1007
01:06:57,378 --> 01:06:59,376
Yeah?

1008
01:07:07,368 --> 01:07:09,366
You can go.

1009
01:07:17,358 --> 01:07:19,356
This is Miss Tira speaking.

1010
01:07:20,355 --> 01:07:22,353
I'm sorry, madam, Mr. Clayton's gone away.

1011
01:07:22,353 --> 01:07:25,350
Gone away? When is he expected back?

1012
01:07:25,350 --> 01:07:28,347
I couldn't say definitely
but I'm sure not for several weeks.

1013
01:07:28,347 --> 01:07:31,344
- Is that the only message he left for me?
- Yes, that's all.

1014
01:07:33,342 --> 01:07:34,341
Thanks.

1015
01:07:42,333 --> 01:07:44,331
Hello, Tira darling.
Benny.

1016
01:07:44,331 --> 01:07:47,328
How are you?
You look so marvellous.

1017
01:07:47,328 --> 01:07:51,324
Come right in, sit right down
and make yourself at home.

1018
01:07:52,323 --> 01:07:55,320
Let me look
at that beautiful smile of yours.

1019
01:07:55,320 --> 01:07:59,316
You know about me getting married?
Sure. Congratulations.

1020
01:07:59,316 --> 01:08:00,315
Too late. It's all off.

1021
01:08:00,315 --> 01:08:03,312
Sue the guy for breach of promise.
Certainly.

1022
01:08:03,312 --> 01:08:05,310
- The lowlife.
- No, he ain't, Benny.

1023
01:08:07,308 --> 01:08:09,306
The first guy I ever really loved.

1024
01:08:09,306 --> 01:08:12,303
- I thought he loved me, too.
- What a tragedy.

1025
01:08:13,302 --> 01:08:15,300
We start proceedings immediately.

1026
01:08:15,300 --> 01:08:17,298
How much is he worth?
Millions.

1027
01:08:17,298 --> 01:08:19,296
Millions? We sue him for damages.

1028
01:08:20,295 --> 01:08:21,294
I ain't damaged.

1029
01:08:22,293 --> 01:08:25,290
I just want you to sue him
for breach of promise.

1030
01:08:25,290 --> 01:08:29,286
I got all the proof you want, letters, wires,
newspaper stories, even my trousseau.

1031
01:08:30,285 --> 01:08:33,282
For that trousseau alone we collect plenty.

1032
01:08:33,282 --> 01:08:35,280
It's a cinch.
When do you want the case tried?

1033
01:08:36,279 --> 01:08:37,278
Let me see.

1034
01:08:37,278 --> 01:08:39,276
I go on the road with the show and...

1035
01:08:39,276 --> 01:08:41,274
I'll be back in a few months.

1036
01:08:41,274 --> 01:08:44,271
- Better start then.
- Easy. Got the case.

1037
01:08:44,271 --> 01:08:48,267
Darling, you give me a few details
and I'll serve him with papers right away.

1038
01:08:48,267 --> 01:08:51,264
Okay. First, I'll tell you how I met the guy.

1039
01:08:51,264 --> 01:08:55,260
But remember in anything I say
I ain't got any real animosity for him.

1040
01:08:56,259 --> 01:08:57,258
Of course.

1041
01:09:00,255 --> 01:09:03,252
- If I was a home girl, I'd be heartbroken.
- Yes.

1042
01:09:07,248 --> 01:09:11,244
Miss Tira, I understand you've had
a rather colourful past.

1043
01:09:12,243 --> 01:09:16,239
I gotta admit I've been the love interest
in more than one guy's life.

1044
01:09:18,237 --> 01:09:22,233
I don't see what my past
has got to do with my present.

1045
01:09:22,233 --> 01:09:25,230
We shall show that
to the satisfaction of the court, I believe.

1046
01:09:25,230 --> 01:09:28,227
Nevertheless, the fact remains
that you've been on...

1047
01:09:28,227 --> 01:09:29,226
friendly terms with several men.

1048
01:09:30,225 --> 01:09:32,223
All right, I'm a sweetheart of Sphigma Psi,
so what?

1049
01:09:41,214 --> 01:09:43,212
You must answer questions directly, please.

1050
01:09:46,209 --> 01:09:47,208
Pardon me, Judge.

1051
01:09:54,201 --> 01:09:55,200
Proceed.

1052
01:09:55,200 --> 01:09:57,198
Do you know a man named Wiley...

1053
01:09:57,198 --> 01:09:59,196
generally called Slick?

1054
01:09:59,196 --> 01:10:01,194
Yes, I know the... The gentleman.

1055
01:10:01,194 --> 01:10:04,191
And you recall the man you see there?

1056
01:10:07,188 --> 01:10:10,185
If I'm not mistaken,
you mean that Dallas man.

1057
01:10:11,184 --> 01:10:14,181
And you are also acquainted,
aren't you, with Mr. Kirk Lawrence?

1058
01:10:15,180 --> 01:10:17,178
Yes, I had the pleasure.

1059
01:10:17,178 --> 01:10:20,175
And no doubt you recall
those five gentlemen...

1060
01:10:20,175 --> 01:10:23,172
seated in the first row
right inside the railing?

1061
01:10:23,172 --> 01:10:26,169
<i>Mr. Blake, Mr. Larson, Mr. Willard...</i>

1062
01:10:27,168 --> 01:10:30,165
Mr. Foster, Mr. Harris.

1063
01:10:33,162 --> 01:10:36,159
I do recall their faces
but them ain't the names they gave me.

1064
01:10:44,151 --> 01:10:46,149
Pardon me again, Judge.

1065
01:10:47,148 --> 01:10:48,147
It's all right.

1066
01:10:48,147 --> 01:10:50,145
That's all, Miss Tira.

1067
01:10:50,145 --> 01:10:53,142
Does the plaintiff's attorney
wish any further questions?

1068
01:10:53,142 --> 01:10:55,140
I would like to request recess
for about 10 minutes.

1069
01:10:56,139 --> 01:10:59,136
Is that agreeable to the defence?
Perfectly.

1070
01:10:59,136 --> 01:11:01,134
This court's adjourned for 10 minutes.

1071
01:11:10,125 --> 01:11:12,123
Why did you admit
that you knew all these men?

1072
01:11:12,123 --> 01:11:14,121
I do know them.
You don't want me to commit perjury?

1073
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:17,118
Yes, why didn't you tell me
there was so many men in your life?

1074
01:11:18,117 --> 01:11:19,116
Why shouldn't I know guys?

1075
01:11:19,116 --> 01:11:23,112
I've been around. I travel from coast to coast.

1076
01:11:23,112 --> 01:11:27,108
A dame like me can't make trips like that
without meeting any of the male population.

1077
01:11:27,108 --> 01:11:30,105
Listen to me, Tira.
You know me, I'm a smart lawyer.

1078
01:11:30,105 --> 01:11:33,102
Give me that much loophole
and I'm through it like an eel.

1079
01:11:33,102 --> 01:11:36,099
With what all those guys,
all those riffraffs, pardon me...

1080
01:11:36,099 --> 01:11:39,096
going up to the judge and telling
all they know about you and them.

1081
01:11:39,096 --> 01:11:42,093
- It's curtains for us.
- You mean we're finished?

1082
01:11:42,093 --> 01:11:43,092
Yeah, sure, drop it.

1083
01:11:43,092 --> 01:11:45,090
You had enough publicity.

1084
01:11:46,089 --> 01:11:49,086
What those guys are gonna tell the judge
won't read so nice in the newspapers.

1085
01:11:49,086 --> 01:11:51,084
I ain't gonna drop it.

1086
01:11:51,084 --> 01:11:53,082
Listen, Benny, have I a right
to question witnesses myself?

1087
01:11:54,081 --> 01:11:55,080
Yeah, sure but...

1088
01:11:55,080 --> 01:11:57,078
- That's what I'm gonna do.
- You don't mean it.

1089
01:11:57,078 --> 01:12:01,074
Now Mr. Brown, just tell the jury
in your words, what took place.

1090
01:12:02,073 --> 01:12:05,070
I was watching her dance
and I seen her looking at me.

1091
01:12:06,069 --> 01:12:09,066
I kind of looked back
and she flirted and made a date with me.

1092
01:12:11,064 --> 01:12:14,061
So, I took her out for a ride in my car...

1093
01:12:14,061 --> 01:12:17,058
and she asked me up to her hotel room
where she was living.

1094
01:12:17,058 --> 01:12:18,057
We had a couple of drinks...

1095
01:12:18,057 --> 01:12:21,054
and she put on a phonograph record
and we danced.

1096
01:12:21,054 --> 01:12:24,051
And while we was dancing, she kissed me.

1097
01:12:27,048 --> 01:12:31,044
And how long were you
with Miss Tira in her hotel room?

1098
01:12:31,044 --> 01:12:34,041
- Close to a couple hours, I should say.
- That's all, Mr. Brown.

1099
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:36,039
Cross-examine.

1100
01:12:37,038 --> 01:12:39,036
My client begs
the permission of the court...

1101
01:12:39,036 --> 01:12:41,034
to question the defence witness herself.

1102
01:12:42,033 --> 01:12:45,030
It's a little unusual,
but quite within the plaintiff's right.

1103
01:12:45,030 --> 01:12:48,027
She may question the witnesses.
If you please...

1104
01:12:48,027 --> 01:12:51,024
the court should warn
the jury not to be swayed...

1105
01:12:51,024 --> 01:12:53,022
by any theatricalism by the plaintiff.

1106
01:12:53,022 --> 01:12:57,018
The jury in weighing the evidence
will bear in mind the defence's warning.

1107
01:12:58,017 --> 01:12:59,016
<i>Proceed.</i>

1108
01:13:04,011 --> 01:13:06,009
Lovely tie.

1109
01:13:06,009 --> 01:13:09,006
Mr. Brown, aren't you the man
that had the five wives?

1110
01:13:10,005 --> 01:13:11,004
Yeah.

1111
01:13:11,004 --> 01:13:14,001
And you was married to one
when you were with me, wasn't you?

1112
01:13:14,001 --> 01:13:15,000
- Yes.
- Cheating.

1113
01:13:15,999 --> 01:13:17,997
You made it sound nasty
the way you spoke about us two...

1114
01:13:17,997 --> 01:13:19,995
being alone together in my place.

1115
01:13:19,995 --> 01:13:23,991
And you know nothing happened that
you couldn't tell your grandchildren about.

1116
01:13:24,990 --> 01:13:25,989
Well, I...

1117
01:13:25,989 --> 01:13:28,986
In other words, it was just
a harmless little social date, wasn't it?

1118
01:13:29,985 --> 01:13:30,984
- Yeah.
- Okay, I'm through with you.

1119
01:13:32,982 --> 01:13:33,981
How am I doing?

1120
01:13:36,978 --> 01:13:37,977
Any further questions?

1121
01:13:38,976 --> 01:13:41,973
You're excused, Mr. Brown. Next witness.

1122
01:13:41,973 --> 01:13:42,972
Mr. Kirk Lawrence.

1123
01:13:42,972 --> 01:13:44,970
Mr. Kirk Lawrence, take the stand.

1124
01:13:44,970 --> 01:13:46,968
Quiet, please.

1125
01:13:53,961 --> 01:13:56,958
Do you solemnly swear
to tell the whole truth...

1126
01:13:56,958 --> 01:13:58,956
and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

1127
01:13:58,956 --> 01:14:00,954
I do.
Take the stand.

1128
01:14:00,954 --> 01:14:02,952
Aren't you well-acquainted
with the plaintiff?

1129
01:14:02,952 --> 01:14:05,949
- Yes.
- In fact, you were intimate friends.

1130
01:14:05,949 --> 01:14:06,948
Yes.

1131
01:14:07,947 --> 01:14:10,944
Isn't it true that you once seriously
contemplated asking her to marry you?

1132
01:14:12,942 --> 01:14:13,941
Yes.

1133
01:14:13,941 --> 01:14:15,939
Now, I understand
that after knowing you only a week...

1134
01:14:16,938 --> 01:14:19,935
the plaintiff accepted several thousand
dollars worth of gifts from you.

1135
01:14:19,935 --> 01:14:21,933
Such as a diamond bracelet...

1136
01:14:21,933 --> 01:14:23,931
Gowns, a fur coat...
That's correct.

1137
01:14:23,931 --> 01:14:26,928
And almost immediately
after accepting these gifts...

1138
01:14:26,928 --> 01:14:28,926
she became engaged to Mr. Clayton,
isn't that so?

1139
01:14:29,925 --> 01:14:30,924
Yes.

1140
01:14:30,924 --> 01:14:34,920
And after becoming engaged she refused
to talk to you, even on the telephone.

1141
01:14:35,919 --> 01:14:36,918
Yes.

1142
01:14:36,918 --> 01:14:38,916
Mr. Clayton has more money
than you have, hasn't he?

1143
01:14:39,915 --> 01:14:40,914
That's true.

1144
01:14:40,914 --> 01:14:43,911
What construction did you place upon
this woman's treatment of you?

1145
01:14:44,910 --> 01:14:47,907
In plain words, I felt she simply
played me for a good thing.

1146
01:14:47,907 --> 01:14:48,906
Thank you, Mr. Lawrence.

1147
01:14:52,902 --> 01:14:53,901
Your witness.

1148
01:15:02,892 --> 01:15:05,889
You're not looking to get
those presents back, are you, Mr. Lawrence?

1149
01:15:05,889 --> 01:15:06,888
No, of course not.

1150
01:15:07,887 --> 01:15:10,884
- I don't expect you to return them, anyway.
- You're right, I wouldn't.

1151
01:15:11,883 --> 01:15:15,879
You gave me those presents
because you liked me a little, didn't you?

1152
01:15:15,879 --> 01:15:17,877
Yes.

1153
01:15:17,877 --> 01:15:18,876
I didn't ask you for them, did I?

1154
01:15:18,876 --> 01:15:21,873
I don't regret giving them to you,
if that's what you mean.

1155
01:15:21,873 --> 01:15:23,871
Thanks, I didn't think you did.

1156
01:15:25,869 --> 01:15:27,867
Now, you was engaged to marry a girl...

1157
01:15:27,867 --> 01:15:30,864
just at the time you started
running around with me, wasn't you?

1158
01:15:30,864 --> 01:15:31,863
Yes.

1159
01:15:31,863 --> 01:15:34,860
And you know your fiance
came up to me to see me...

1160
01:15:34,860 --> 01:15:36,858
to ask me to break it off with you, don't you?

1161
01:15:36,858 --> 01:15:37,857
I heard so.

1162
01:15:37,857 --> 01:15:39,855
All right, I broke it off.
So what are you crying about?

1163
01:15:43,851 --> 01:15:46,848
Your Honour, this sort of questioning
is most irregular.

1164
01:15:46,848 --> 01:15:48,846
The plaintiff, not being
a practicing attorney...

1165
01:15:50,844 --> 01:15:52,842
may put her questions as best she can.

1166
01:15:52,842 --> 01:15:53,841
Thanks, Judge, you're regular.

1167
01:15:53,841 --> 01:15:55,839
I'm doing my best to be legitimate.

1168
01:15:55,839 --> 01:15:56,838
That's all with you.

1169
01:16:00,834 --> 01:16:01,833
Any further questions?

1170
01:16:01,833 --> 01:16:04,830
Defence is ready for the next witness.
Excused.

1171
01:16:04,830 --> 01:16:06,828
Proceed.
Miss Beulah Thorndyke.

1172
01:16:08,826 --> 01:16:11,823
They had nerve enough
to call my own maid to squeal on me?

1173
01:16:11,823 --> 01:16:13,821
You are Miss Tira's personal maid,
aren't you?

1174
01:16:14,820 --> 01:16:17,817
I was, but I ain't sure now.

1175
01:16:17,817 --> 01:16:20,814
As her personal maid, it was your duty
to answer telephone calls...

1176
01:16:21,813 --> 01:16:22,812
and admit visitors to the apartment?

1177
01:16:22,812 --> 01:16:24,810
Yes, ma'am... Yes, sir.

1178
01:16:25,809 --> 01:16:27,807
Miss Tira often had
gentlemen callers, didn't she?

1179
01:16:27,807 --> 01:16:28,806
Quite some.

1180
01:16:29,805 --> 01:16:31,803
During the time Miss Tira
and Mr. Clayton were engaged...

1181
01:16:31,803 --> 01:16:33,801
did she have other men visitors?

1182
01:16:35,799 --> 01:16:36,798
Not that I recall.

1183
01:16:38,796 --> 01:16:40,794
You have a very convenient memory.

1184
01:16:40,794 --> 01:16:42,792
That's all. Cross-examine.

1185
01:16:45,789 --> 01:16:48,786
Shadow, what are you doing here?
I don't know.

1186
01:16:49,785 --> 01:16:51,783
They done subpoenaed me.

1187
01:16:52,782 --> 01:16:54,780
- Beulah, tell the boys the truth.
- Yes, ma'am.

1188
01:16:54,780 --> 01:16:56,778
After Mr. Clayton and me became engaged...

1189
01:16:56,778 --> 01:16:58,776
did you ever hear me talk
about any other man...

1190
01:16:58,776 --> 01:17:00,774
or did you ever see me with any other man...

1191
01:17:02,772 --> 01:17:04,770
- outside of my manager, Mr. Barton?
- No, ma'am.

1192
01:17:04,770 --> 01:17:07,767
Did you ever hear me make any cracks
about Mr. Clayton's money?

1193
01:17:07,767 --> 01:17:09,765
- No, ma'am.
- Did you hear me talk about Mr. Clayton?

1194
01:17:10,764 --> 01:17:11,763
Oh, yes, ma'am.

1195
01:17:12,762 --> 01:17:13,761
What did you hear me say?

1196
01:17:13,761 --> 01:17:15,759
- You said...
- Just a minute.

1197
01:17:18,756 --> 01:17:19,755
Tell the jury.

1198
01:17:19,755 --> 01:17:21,753
- Is that all right with you, Judge?
- Yes.

1199
01:17:22,752 --> 01:17:23,751
Proceed.

1200
01:17:23,751 --> 01:17:27,747
You said that you never knew
you could love a man like you love him.

1201
01:17:30,744 --> 01:17:31,743
I kind of forgot I said that.

1202
01:17:31,743 --> 01:17:34,740
And you said you had fallen
so hard for him that it hurt.

1203
01:17:35,739 --> 01:17:36,738
Wait a minute.

1204
01:17:37,737 --> 01:17:39,735
Answer one question at a time.

1205
01:17:39,735 --> 01:17:41,733
I just telling the truth like you told me to.

1206
01:17:41,733 --> 01:17:43,731
Yes, but you're telling too much of it.

1207
01:17:43,731 --> 01:17:46,728
I ain't never seen nobody
so brokenhearted as you was...

1208
01:17:46,728 --> 01:17:48,726
when you and Mr. Clayton done bust up.

1209
01:17:50,724 --> 01:17:53,721
That's enough, Beulah.
You're ruining my character.

1210
01:17:53,721 --> 01:17:57,717
I object, Your Honour.
This witness' testimony is entirely irrelevant.

1211
01:17:57,717 --> 01:17:58,716
I move to strike it from record.

1212
01:17:58,716 --> 01:17:59,715
Motion denied.

1213
01:17:59,715 --> 01:18:01,713
Any more questions?
No.

1214
01:18:01,713 --> 01:18:03,711
You're excused. Next witness.

1215
01:18:03,711 --> 01:18:05,709
Call Mr. Slick Wiley to the stand.

1216
01:18:05,709 --> 01:18:07,707
Mr. Wiley, Mr. Slick Wiley,
please take the stand.

1217
01:18:10,704 --> 01:18:13,701
- Bob, do you have to question this man?
- Of course, Jack.

1218
01:18:13,701 --> 01:18:16,698
He'll win our case for us.
She can't laugh him off.

1219
01:18:17,697 --> 01:18:19,695
Don't mention the night
I found him at her apartment.

1220
01:18:20,694 --> 01:18:21,693
I've got to ask him about that.

1221
01:18:21,693 --> 01:18:25,689
That's what I'm depending on.
I don't want you to mention it.

1222
01:18:25,689 --> 01:18:27,687
All right, I'll keep it as clean as I can.

1223
01:18:30,684 --> 01:18:33,681
When he gets through with Slick,
we haven't got a chance.

1224
01:18:33,681 --> 01:18:36,678
Mr. Wiley, you know the plaintiff,
Miss Tira, very well, do you not?

1225
01:18:37,677 --> 01:18:40,674
Sure, we've been like that.

1226
01:18:41,673 --> 01:18:43,671
During the time...

1227
01:18:43,671 --> 01:18:46,668
the plaintiff was engaged
to the defendant, Mr. Clayton...

1228
01:18:46,668 --> 01:18:47,667
were you friendly with her?

1229
01:18:48,666 --> 01:18:50,664
Never better.

1230
01:18:50,664 --> 01:18:54,660
Isn't it true the plaintiff used to give you
sums of money at times for your own use?

1231
01:18:54,660 --> 01:18:58,656
Yeah, sure. She was always a good
for anywhere from $10 to a C-note.

1232
01:18:58,656 --> 01:18:59,655
Isn't it also a fact...

1233
01:18:59,655 --> 01:19:02,652
that you kept personal belongings
in the plaintiff's apartment?

1234
01:19:02,652 --> 01:19:07,647
<i>And that on at least once you were seen</i>
<i>in her apartment only partly dressed?</i>

1235
01:19:07,647 --> 01:19:09,645
You mean in pyjamas?
Yes.

1236
01:19:09,645 --> 01:19:11,643
Yeah, I always kept two pair there.

1237
01:19:12,642 --> 01:19:13,641
Silk ones.

1238
01:19:13,641 --> 01:19:15,639
One green and one purple
with yellow stripes.

1239
01:19:19,635 --> 01:19:21,633
Mr. Wiley,
did the plaintiff ever suggest to you...

1240
01:19:21,633 --> 01:19:25,629
her interest in the defendant
was principally because of his wealth?

1241
01:19:25,629 --> 01:19:26,628
Yeah, sure.

1242
01:19:26,628 --> 01:19:29,625
She always looked to hook
some guy with a lot of dough.

1243
01:19:30,624 --> 01:19:33,621
That's all, Mr. Wiley. Cross-examine.

1244
01:19:37,617 --> 01:19:39,615
Where were you
on the night of June 7?

1245
01:19:42,612 --> 01:19:43,611
I don't remember.

1246
01:19:43,611 --> 01:19:48,606
All right, I'll give you a choice, where were
you any night last June, July, or August?

1247
01:19:49,605 --> 01:19:51,603
Come on, make up your mind.

1248
01:19:52,602 --> 01:19:53,601
In stir.

1249
01:19:53,601 --> 01:19:56,598
That's it, speak up so they can hear you.

1250
01:19:56,598 --> 01:19:57,597
He was in stir.

1251
01:19:57,597 --> 01:20:01,593
That means, in other words,
gentlemen of the jury, he was in jail.

1252
01:20:02,592 --> 01:20:06,588
Tell the gentlemen how many other jails
you been in the last 10 years.

1253
01:20:07,587 --> 01:20:08,586
I don't remember.

1254
01:20:09,585 --> 01:20:10,584
He can't remember.

1255
01:20:10,584 --> 01:20:12,582
<i>And what's this</i>
<i>about you owning silk pyjamas?</i>

1256
01:20:13,581 --> 01:20:14,580
<i>You know it's a lie.</i>

1257
01:20:14,580 --> 01:20:16,578
You forgot to tell these good people...

1258
01:20:17,577 --> 01:20:20,574
the only time I gave you money
was when you got out of jail...

1259
01:20:20,574 --> 01:20:22,572
you were broke, and walking on your heels.

1260
01:20:22,572 --> 01:20:23,571
You heel.

1261
01:20:24,570 --> 01:20:27,567
As for you sitting in my apartment
in silk pyjamas...

1262
01:20:27,567 --> 01:20:29,565
you never sat around my apartment
in nothing.

1263
01:20:29,565 --> 01:20:30,564
And you know it.

1264
01:20:32,562 --> 01:20:33,561
Answer me, did you?

1265
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:35,559
Sure, I did.

1266
01:20:36,558 --> 01:20:38,556
- And I was seen there, too.
- Why you...

1267
01:20:39,555 --> 01:20:40,554
You perjurer.

1268
01:20:41,553 --> 01:20:43,551
I object to the witness
being harassed this way.

1269
01:20:43,551 --> 01:20:45,549
Who's harassing who?

1270
01:20:46,548 --> 01:20:49,545
I'm just asking for a square deal, that's all.

1271
01:20:49,545 --> 01:20:51,543
I'm asking good, honest,
and intelligent people not to take...

1272
01:20:52,542 --> 01:20:55,539
the word of an ex-convict
against a good, honest and innocent woman.

1273
01:20:55,539 --> 01:20:57,537
I object, Your Honour.

1274
01:20:57,537 --> 01:20:59,535
Objection overruled.
You're right, Judge.

1275
01:21:04,530 --> 01:21:05,529
There you are.

1276
01:21:06,528 --> 01:21:08,526
She's got the jury and the judge
under her arm.

1277
01:21:08,526 --> 01:21:10,524
They'll hand her the case on a silver platter.

1278
01:21:11,523 --> 01:21:12,522
- Don't be unfair.
- Unfair?

1279
01:21:12,522 --> 01:21:15,519
You've got so much money,
you don't mind losing this case.

1280
01:21:15,519 --> 01:21:17,517
But my reputation means something to me.

1281
01:21:17,517 --> 01:21:19,515
If ever there was a case I wanted to win,
this is it.

1282
01:21:20,514 --> 01:21:22,512
I told you not to put the man on the stand
in the first place.

1283
01:21:22,512 --> 01:21:25,509
You'll have to take stand and tell your story.

1284
01:21:25,509 --> 01:21:26,508
I'll do nothing of the kind.

1285
01:21:26,508 --> 01:21:30,504
If you feel that way about it,
why did you contest the case at all?

1286
01:21:33,501 --> 01:21:35,499
I'm sorry I did.

1287
01:21:36,498 --> 01:21:40,494
If any right-thinking man will believe
what a crook and a jailbird will say...

1288
01:21:40,494 --> 01:21:43,491
then there's nothing I could say
that'll make any difference.

1289
01:21:43,491 --> 01:21:45,489
I'm through with this guy, Judge.

1290
01:21:45,489 --> 01:21:47,487
Do you wish to question the witness further?

1291
01:21:47,487 --> 01:21:50,484
Yes. I have a few questions
I should like to ask.

1292
01:21:50,484 --> 01:21:53,481
- Mr. Wiley...
- Stop. Sit down.

1293
01:21:55,479 --> 01:21:57,477
That's enough. Call it off.

1294
01:21:57,477 --> 01:22:01,473
- I'll settle for the amount asked.
- You're absolutely mad.

1295
01:22:01,473 --> 01:22:04,470
I don't want it to go any further,
do you understand?

1296
01:22:05,469 --> 01:22:06,468
All right, have it your own way.

1297
01:22:06,468 --> 01:22:10,464
If you want to make a fool of yourself
over this woman, I can't stop you.

1298
01:22:10,464 --> 01:22:11,463
Don't try to.

1299
01:22:12,462 --> 01:22:13,461
Your Honour...

1300
01:22:13,461 --> 01:22:16,458
my client has requested me,
for some peculiar reason of his own...

1301
01:22:16,458 --> 01:22:18,456
to cease contest of this suit.

1302
01:22:19,455 --> 01:22:22,452
He's prepared to settle
for the full amount of the case.

1303
01:22:22,452 --> 01:22:24,450
How extraordinary.
I'll say it is.

1304
01:22:24,450 --> 01:22:27,447
- What is this, Benny?
- Don't ask me, I'm paralysed.

1305
01:22:27,447 --> 01:22:29,445
Sounds like a trick.

1306
01:22:29,445 --> 01:22:32,442
Does the plaintiff accept this motion
as satisfaction of this suit?

1307
01:22:32,442 --> 01:22:35,439
Okay, the plaintiff accepts it with pleasure.

1308
01:22:35,439 --> 01:22:37,437
In view of the agreement
between the parties...

1309
01:22:37,437 --> 01:22:39,435
the jury is discharged with thanks.

1310
01:22:40,434 --> 01:22:42,432
Case dismissed. Court's adjourned.

1311
01:22:47,427 --> 01:22:49,425
I'm glad you won your case,
Miss Tira.

1312
01:22:49,425 --> 01:22:51,423
That's our pleasure.

1313
01:22:51,423 --> 01:22:55,419
Wait a minute. Boys, now, take it easy.

1314
01:22:55,419 --> 01:22:57,417
I'll give you all the breaks in the worid
but don't crowd.

1315
01:22:57,417 --> 01:22:59,415
Pictures first.

1316
01:23:00,414 --> 01:23:02,412
Miss Tira,
would you stand up?

1317
01:23:02,412 --> 01:23:04,410
Of course, if it'll make you happy.

1318
01:23:04,410 --> 01:23:06,408
Look this way, please.

1319
01:23:06,408 --> 01:23:08,406
Wait a minute boys, one at a time.
I'm not twins.

1320
01:23:10,404 --> 01:23:12,402
Hold that pose, please.

1321
01:23:12,402 --> 01:23:14,400
That's it. All right.

1322
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:16,398
Hold for me, please.

1323
01:23:16,398 --> 01:23:17,397
Thank you.

1324
01:23:19,395 --> 01:23:21,393
- Will you answer a few questions, Miss Tira?
- Of course.

1325
01:23:21,393 --> 01:23:23,391
You've won the case.
What do you intend to do?

1326
01:23:23,391 --> 01:23:25,389
Carry on the same as before.

1327
01:23:25,389 --> 01:23:28,386
Why did you admit knowing
so many men in your life?

1328
01:23:28,386 --> 01:23:31,383
It's not the men in your life that counts,
it's the life in your men.

1329
01:23:33,381 --> 01:23:35,379
Do you feel you've done right?

1330
01:23:35,379 --> 01:23:37,377
Show me a woman who can do better.

1331
01:23:40,374 --> 01:23:42,372
You were right, Judge.

1332
01:23:43,371 --> 01:23:46,368
- It was nice of you to come up.
- Thank you.

1333
01:23:46,368 --> 01:23:48,366
You've been charming, my dear.
Very charming.

1334
01:23:49,365 --> 01:23:51,363
- I'm glad you found that out.
- Of course.

1335
01:23:51,363 --> 01:23:53,361
Well, goodbye.

1336
01:23:54,360 --> 01:23:56,358
I see you've that hand trouble, too, huh?

1337
01:23:58,356 --> 01:24:01,353
- Goodbye again.
- Goodbye.

1338
01:24:07,347 --> 01:24:08,346
Hello?

1339
01:24:09,345 --> 01:24:11,343
Juror Number 4.

1340
01:24:12,342 --> 01:24:14,340
Yes, I remember you.

1341
01:24:14,340 --> 01:24:16,338
You were the one with the nice, kind face.

1342
01:24:18,336 --> 01:24:20,334
I know you were for me.

1343
01:24:25,329 --> 01:24:27,327
I wanna thank you
for those beautiful flowers.

1344
01:24:27,327 --> 01:24:29,325
They were lovely.

1345
01:24:29,325 --> 01:24:32,322
And don't forget,
come up and see me sometime.

1346
01:24:33,321 --> 01:24:35,319
Mr. Clayton, how is you?

1347
01:24:37,317 --> 01:24:38,316
Yes.

1348
01:24:40,314 --> 01:24:42,312
All right, goodbye.

1349
01:24:46,308 --> 01:24:50,304
You said things in the courtroom
that led me to believe you loved me.

1350
01:24:50,304 --> 01:24:52,302
That you still love me. Did you mean them?

1351
01:24:53,301 --> 01:24:57,297
- What difference does it make now?
- All the difference in the worid.

1352
01:24:57,297 --> 01:24:58,296
You didn't believe me before.

1353
01:24:58,296 --> 01:25:01,293
Because I didn't understand
about Slick being up here that night.

1354
01:25:02,292 --> 01:25:04,290
So that's it.

1355
01:25:04,290 --> 01:25:08,286
I didn't understand it myself
till I found out it was all a big frame-up.

1356
01:25:08,286 --> 01:25:10,284
To keep me from leaving the show.

1357
01:25:11,283 --> 01:25:13,281
Then let's forget the whole thing
and go on together.

1358
01:25:14,280 --> 01:25:16,278
- You sure you want it that way?
- You know I do.

1359
01:25:17,277 --> 01:25:18,276
Sit down.

1360
01:25:19,275 --> 01:25:21,273
You're everything to me.

1361
01:25:23,271 --> 01:25:24,270
Beulah.
Yes, ma'am.

1362
01:25:24,270 --> 01:25:26,268
Bring me my jewel case.

1363
01:25:27,267 --> 01:25:30,264
- You're more fascinating than ever.
- I get better as I go along.

1364
01:25:30,264 --> 01:25:32,262
Here, Miss Tira.

1365
01:25:32,262 --> 01:25:33,261
Got something for you.

1366
01:25:36,258 --> 01:25:38,256
I'm glad to know
it wasn't the money you wanted.

1367
01:25:38,256 --> 01:25:41,253
You got a lot of other things
it takes to make a woman happy.

1368
01:25:43,251 --> 01:25:45,249
I'm crazy about you.

1369
01:25:45,249 --> 01:25:47,247
I did my best to make you that way.

1370
01:25:47,247 --> 01:25:50,244
Look, darling, you need a rest, and so do I.

1371
01:25:50,244 --> 01:25:53,241
- Let me take you away somewhere.
- Would you call that a rest?

1372
01:25:55,239 --> 01:25:58,236
- What are you thinking about?
- The same thing you are.

1373
01:26:08,226 --> 01:26:11,223
<i>Baby, I can warm you</i>
<i>with this love of mine</i>

1374
01:26:12,222 --> 01:26:15,219
<i>I'm no ngel</i>

1375
01:26:16,218 --> 01:26:19,215
<i>Oh, let me feel my fingers</i>
<i>running through your hair</i>

1376
01:26:20,214 --> 01:26:23,211
<i>I can give you kisses till you</i>

1377
