1
00:02:28,421 --> 00:02:31,630
Ivan and I moved here
a few months ago.

2
00:02:31,796 --> 00:02:34,005
The world was falling apart...

3
00:02:34,171 --> 00:02:37,880
...and I wanted to save it
and save myself.

4
00:02:38,047 --> 00:02:40,089
I felt like Noah.

5
00:02:40,464 --> 00:02:42,005
In the coop on my terrace...

6
00:02:42,172 --> 00:02:45,423
...I wanted to save
a couple of each species.

7
00:02:46,547 --> 00:02:48,298
Anyway...

8
00:02:48,464 --> 00:02:51,589
...I couldn't save
the couple I cared about most:

9
00:02:51,797 --> 00:02:53,132
Ivan and me.

10
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:55,299
Pepa, darling...

11
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:58,674
...I never want to hear you say,
"I'm unhappy."

12
00:02:58,841 --> 00:03:00,050
Yours, Ivan.

13
00:03:31,302 --> 00:03:33,760
Life means nothing without you.

14
00:03:34,843 --> 00:03:37,135
Will you marry me?

15
00:03:40,469 --> 00:03:43,595
A million nights
wouldn't be enough.

16
00:03:45,387 --> 00:03:47,678
I can't live without you.

17
00:03:47,844 --> 00:03:50,720
I love you,
desire you, need you.

18
00:03:51,761 --> 00:03:54,220
That night in the jungle
was heaven.

19
00:03:54,429 --> 00:03:57,304
Let's get married again.

20
00:03:57,845 --> 00:04:00,555
You're the geisha of my life.
Sayonara.

21
00:04:02,305 --> 00:04:05,055
With you by my side,
I don't need success.

22
00:04:05,222 --> 00:04:07,972
I'm willing
to accept you as you are.

23
00:04:10,389 --> 00:04:13,722
Baby, some things
are unmistakably American.

24
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,890
I'm all yours.

25
00:04:19,556 --> 00:04:22,722
- I accept you as you are.
- Great.

26
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:34,558
How many men
have you had to forget?

27
00:04:36,474 --> 00:04:37,891
Say something nice.

28
00:04:41,975 --> 00:04:43,100
Lie.

29
00:04:43,308 --> 00:04:45,601
Tell me you've been
waiting for me...

30
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:50,726
...and you'd die
if I didn't return.

31
00:04:53,809 --> 00:04:55,643
Say you still love me
as I love you.

32
00:05:04,019 --> 00:05:05,311
Thanks.

33
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:08,560
Thanks a lot.

34
00:05:31,147 --> 00:05:33,312
Call these two numbers.

35
00:05:35,146 --> 00:05:36,272
First, I'll call one...

36
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,438
...then the other.

37
00:05:45,481 --> 00:05:47,105
Pepa.

38
00:05:47,272 --> 00:05:50,607
Pepa, sweetheart,
did you oversleep?

39
00:05:50,773 --> 00:05:52,814
We started without you.

40
00:05:53,814 --> 00:05:56,773
Listen. Pack all my stuff
in a suitcase.

41
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:59,065
I'm going on a trip tomorrow.

42
00:05:59,231 --> 00:06:01,607
I'll come and pick it up
and say goodbye...

43
00:06:01,773 --> 00:06:03,607
...but I'll call you before.

44
00:06:03,774 --> 00:06:06,940
If you don't want to see me,
just leave it downstairs.

45
00:06:08,232 --> 00:06:10,650
Thanks for being so understanding.

46
00:06:10,817 --> 00:06:12,441
I don't deserve it.

47
00:06:14,775 --> 00:06:16,234
I'll call later, darling.

48
00:06:19,276 --> 00:06:20,775
Ivan?

49
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:33,485
"EXA." Hello.

50
00:06:33,652 --> 00:06:35,944
Is Ivan there?

51
00:06:36,152 --> 00:06:37,443
He just called me.

52
00:06:37,651 --> 00:06:39,777
Sorry. He just left.

53
00:06:39,944 --> 00:06:44,444
But your director is here
having a fit because you're not here.

54
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:46,570
Yes. Here he is.

55
00:06:50,695 --> 00:06:52,403
I'm sorry, German.

56
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:56,237
I couldn't sleep,
so I took a pill.

57
00:06:56,404 --> 00:06:59,945
Don't worry. Just come now.

58
00:07:00,112 --> 00:07:01,571
I'll be right there.

59
00:07:01,736 --> 00:07:05,779
I have to stop by
for some test results on my way.

60
00:07:05,947 --> 00:07:08,279
Okay, but make it quick.

61
00:07:09,696 --> 00:07:12,946
Some people are lucky.
I'll call your cab now.

62
00:07:15,447 --> 00:07:17,447
Who wanted a taxi?

63
00:07:18,863 --> 00:07:22,823
Whoever asked for a taxi,
come to the front desk.

64
00:07:22,989 --> 00:07:24,823
Don't smoke...

65
00:07:24,989 --> 00:07:27,698
...eat properly,
and you'll be fine.

66
00:07:40,657 --> 00:07:44,575
Mr. Salcedo,
please pick up the telephone.

67
00:07:45,491 --> 00:07:47,324
It's about time. Studio seven.

68
00:07:47,491 --> 00:07:48,783
Did Ivan call again?

69
00:07:48,992 --> 00:07:51,284
No. Forget him, honey.

70
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:53,450
I'm working on it.

71
00:07:53,658 --> 00:07:54,992
Just give me time.

72
00:07:55,159 --> 00:07:56,826
And cut the microphone.

73
00:07:57,492 --> 00:08:00,451
Give me that paper!
Give me that!

74
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,827
- I'm really sorry, guys.
- Okay, let's go.

75
00:08:23,452 --> 00:08:25,829
Arturo, do you take...

76
00:08:25,995 --> 00:08:27,494
...Eugenia as your wife...

77
00:08:27,661 --> 00:08:30,454
...and promise to be faithful,
for richer or for poorer...

78
00:08:30,663 --> 00:08:33,037
...in sickness and in health,
until death do you part?

79
00:08:33,204 --> 00:08:35,288
Yeah, I think so.

80
00:08:38,329 --> 00:08:40,788
And you, Eugenia. Eugenia?

81
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:42,621
Yes, Father?

82
00:08:42,871 --> 00:08:44,497
Do you take Arturo
as your husband?

83
00:08:44,747 --> 00:08:46,954
Sure. Of course I do.

84
00:08:48,705 --> 00:08:51,789
What God has united,
let no man tear asunder.

85
00:08:52,038 --> 00:08:54,248
Can we kiss now, Father?

86
00:08:54,498 --> 00:08:57,497
My child, you mustn't trust any man.

87
00:08:57,664 --> 00:08:59,206
Not even my husband?

88
00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:01,956
You can't be too careful.

89
00:09:02,831 --> 00:09:05,290
Fine. We'll check it later.

90
00:09:05,456 --> 00:09:07,123
Roll it.

91
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:09,874
- You start rehearsing.
- Thank you.

92
00:09:36,335 --> 00:09:37,834
Here. Drink.

93
00:09:38,001 --> 00:09:39,459
I'm not thirsty.

94
00:09:39,627 --> 00:09:41,336
It'll help you to sleep.

95
00:09:41,502 --> 00:09:45,335
I already tried it,
and it didn't help.

96
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:47,835
How many men
have you had to forget?

97
00:09:48,002 --> 00:09:51,002
As many as the women
you remember.

98
00:09:51,169 --> 00:09:52,502
Don't go.

99
00:09:52,669 --> 00:09:54,003
I haven't moved.

100
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:56,086
Say something nice.

101
00:09:57,669 --> 00:10:00,128
What shall I say?

102
00:10:00,295 --> 00:10:03,962
Lie. Tell me you've
waited for me forever.

103
00:10:05,045 --> 00:10:07,337
I've waited for you
all these years.

104
00:10:07,504 --> 00:10:09,838
Say you'd die
if I didn't return.

105
00:10:10,005 --> 00:10:13,295
I'd have died
if you hadn't returned.

106
00:10:13,463 --> 00:10:16,964
Say you still love me
as I love you.

107
00:10:17,129 --> 00:10:19,963
I still love you as you love me.

108
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:22,463
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

109
00:10:28,839 --> 00:10:30,798
Pepa, are you okay?

110
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:36,007
Yeah, I'm fine.
I'll be right back.

111
00:10:53,757 --> 00:10:55,842
You've got some nerve.

112
00:10:56,008 --> 00:10:58,134
Call this number, please.

113
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:00,468
You have no right, Pepa.

114
00:11:00,634 --> 00:11:01,968
Just dial the number.

115
00:11:02,134 --> 00:11:03,592
You're making a fool of yourself.

116
00:11:03,758 --> 00:11:06,176
Well, a little more won't hurt.

117
00:11:06,343 --> 00:11:08,134
- Were you crying?
- Yes.

118
00:11:08,301 --> 00:11:11,676
There! You see? I knew it, Pepa.

119
00:11:11,843 --> 00:11:15,468
Dial! They won't like
you holding up our work.

120
00:11:15,635 --> 00:11:20,135
Yes, right away.
Excuse me! At your service!

121
00:11:20,302 --> 00:11:21,636
My coffee can wait.

122
00:11:21,803 --> 00:11:24,511
I've had enough breakfasts
in my time.

123
00:11:24,677 --> 00:11:26,511
The other woman's number.

124
00:11:26,678 --> 00:11:29,844
She'll never learn. Not her.

125
00:11:30,011 --> 00:11:33,845
She should have by now.
Not her.

126
00:11:35,513 --> 00:11:36,679
No way.

127
00:11:39,096 --> 00:11:42,512
- Who's this?
- Pepa Marcos. Is Ivan there?

128
00:11:44,346 --> 00:11:47,929
- Forgive my bothering you.
- Not as sorry as I am.

129
00:11:48,096 --> 00:11:49,763
I must speak to him. It's urgent.

130
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:51,305
How dare you call here?

131
00:11:51,472 --> 00:11:54,638
Don't yell at me.
I just had a fainting spell.

132
00:11:54,847 --> 00:11:56,806
I don't care if you drop dead!

133
00:11:57,014 --> 00:11:59,514
Look, Ivan and I are finished.

134
00:11:59,681 --> 00:12:01,973
- Fuck off!
- Fuck off yourself!

135
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:05,515
Just tell him to call me.

136
00:12:07,972 --> 00:12:10,473
Pepa, I didn't know
you had fainted.

137
00:12:10,682 --> 00:12:11,974
Poor thing.

138
00:12:12,183 --> 00:12:13,807
This is too much!

139
00:12:14,015 --> 00:12:15,640
Don't you dare defend her!

140
00:12:15,807 --> 00:12:17,267
- Mom.
- Yes?

141
00:12:17,473 --> 00:12:18,808
We should talk.

142
00:12:18,974 --> 00:12:22,974
Not now. I'm doing my eye lines,
and you make me nervous.

143
00:12:23,141 --> 00:12:24,975
Okay. Then later?

144
00:12:25,183 --> 00:12:27,683
Later. Later.

145
00:12:30,767 --> 00:12:32,100
What's wrong?

146
00:12:32,267 --> 00:12:36,351
That bitch Ivan sleeps with
had the nerve to call me.

147
00:12:36,518 --> 00:12:39,643
He should be more discreet.

148
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:42,227
Why haven't I thrown those out?

149
00:12:42,394 --> 00:12:44,143
Dad wouldn't let you.

150
00:12:44,351 --> 00:12:46,977
I could sell them at the store,
you know?

151
00:12:47,143 --> 00:12:48,976
I like wearing them.

152
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:50,977
It's as if time stood still.

153
00:12:51,144 --> 00:12:54,186
Well, it hasn't stood still.

154
00:12:55,311 --> 00:12:58,894
Don't be rude.
Let her wear what she wants.

155
00:12:59,061 --> 00:13:01,895
Go on. Humor her.
She'll never get well.

156
00:13:02,061 --> 00:13:03,895
Let me help you.

157
00:13:04,061 --> 00:13:06,854
- Hold that.
- Let's see. There.

158
00:13:12,105 --> 00:13:13,979
Like it?

159
00:13:14,146 --> 00:13:15,980
You look terrific.

160
00:13:16,147 --> 00:13:19,687
You're a great liar, Dad.
That's why I love you.

161
00:13:21,688 --> 00:13:23,562
You think it's too dark?

162
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:26,855
- No.
- Neither do I.

163
00:13:33,856 --> 00:13:36,856
- Am I interrupting something?
- No. How are you?

164
00:13:37,023 --> 00:13:39,231
- Fine.
- How's the penthouse?

165
00:13:39,398 --> 00:13:42,856
- Are you enjoying it?
- It's great, but I'm here to sublet it.

166
00:13:43,022 --> 00:13:45,065
We'll get a good price for it.

167
00:13:45,232 --> 00:13:48,482
Good. I'll want to rent an apartment.

168
00:13:48,691 --> 00:13:51,482
Can I make a call?
I've been out all day.

169
00:13:51,691 --> 00:13:53,482
What type of apartment?

170
00:13:53,691 --> 00:13:56,775
With a terrace, but not so big.

171
00:13:58,357 --> 00:14:01,358
- Yours is number seven Montalban?
- Yes, seventh floor.

172
00:14:01,526 --> 00:14:05,233
220 square yards
including the terrace.

173
00:14:09,317 --> 00:14:12,817
Everybody just loved
your scale model.

174
00:14:13,026 --> 00:14:14,318
It turned out well.

175
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:16,152
The jerk hasn't called.

176
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:19,276
- How much is that?
- 200 pesetas.

177
00:14:23,318 --> 00:14:26,777
- Is Isabel here?
- She's busy. Can I help you?

178
00:14:26,944 --> 00:14:29,486
- I have to see her.
- One moment.

179
00:14:33,361 --> 00:14:34,486
Hi.

180
00:14:35,529 --> 00:14:37,819
You want to try a facial?

181
00:14:38,028 --> 00:14:40,654
- I can't now.
- It's free.

182
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,987
They're giving a demonstration.

183
00:14:43,195 --> 00:14:45,946
I need sleeping pills.

184
00:14:46,113 --> 00:14:47,655
I've run out.

185
00:14:47,862 --> 00:14:51,947
- You have the prescription?
- No. I'll bring it later or tomorrow.

186
00:14:52,113 --> 00:14:54,321
I can't sleep without them.

187
00:14:54,488 --> 00:14:57,155
- Okay.
- Thanks.

188
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:06,114
- She's not much in person.
- She's skinnier than on TV.

189
00:15:25,074 --> 00:15:29,116
Pepa, honey, are you there?

190
00:15:29,282 --> 00:15:32,033
If I can't reach you,
I'm going to get worried.

191
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,533
So am I.

192
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:37,617
I've had no luck
reaching you today, so...

193
00:15:37,868 --> 00:15:39,450
Well?

194
00:15:39,617 --> 00:15:42,118
I feel you're avoiding me.

195
00:15:43,201 --> 00:15:44,534
Such bullshit.

196
00:15:44,701 --> 00:15:47,368
I'll keep trying until I get you.

197
00:15:47,535 --> 00:15:49,827
- I may get lucky.
- Sure.

198
00:15:49,993 --> 00:15:52,535
I really want to talk to you.

199
00:15:52,702 --> 00:15:55,535
- I miss you.
- I noticed.

200
00:15:55,702 --> 00:15:57,869
Well, take care.

201
00:15:58,035 --> 00:15:59,869
See you later.

202
00:16:00,036 --> 00:16:02,036
Asshole.

203
00:16:34,414 --> 00:16:36,372
This is Juan
at the real estate agency.

204
00:16:36,539 --> 00:16:39,789
Tomorrow I'm sending a couple
to see your apartment.

205
00:16:39,955 --> 00:16:42,456
Try to be there in the morning.
Thank you.

206
00:17:07,376 --> 00:17:08,833
I'm sick of being good.

207
00:17:41,878 --> 00:17:43,878
I shouldn't smoke.

208
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:58,926
I'm finally getting rid of this shit!

209
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:02,969
And this dumb flower!

210
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:07,678
Who'd think of giving a duck
as a present?

211
00:19:07,886 --> 00:19:09,177
Only you.

212
00:19:09,386 --> 00:19:13,511
But now I'll get rid of it all.
And of you!

213
00:20:35,768 --> 00:20:39,227
"Something's come up
that concerns both of us.

214
00:20:39,393 --> 00:20:43,811
I must talk to you before you leave."

215
00:21:16,064 --> 00:21:18,148
Follow that cab!

216
00:21:18,314 --> 00:21:22,190
I thought this only happened
in the movies.

217
00:21:25,439 --> 00:21:27,066
WELCOME TO MAMBO TAXI

218
00:21:28,191 --> 00:21:30,107
MAGAZINES FOR RENT

219
00:21:30,773 --> 00:21:33,525
Help yourself.
It's on the house.

220
00:21:33,692 --> 00:21:36,316
Thanks. Just follow that cab.

221
00:21:36,482 --> 00:21:39,274
Don't worry. It's under control.

222
00:21:40,274 --> 00:21:42,066
Do you mind the Mambo?

223
00:21:42,233 --> 00:21:45,358
I've got everything.
Heavy metal, rock, soul...

224
00:21:45,567 --> 00:21:48,525
...cumbias, even sevillanas.

225
00:21:48,692 --> 00:21:51,025
Salsa, techno-pop...

226
00:21:51,234 --> 00:21:52,693
...whatever you like.

227
00:21:52,859 --> 00:21:55,276
- You really like Mambo?
- I love Mambo.

228
00:21:55,442 --> 00:21:57,568
Yes, the Mambo...

229
00:21:57,734 --> 00:22:00,401
...goes best with this decor.

230
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:04,985
You're that TV actress.

231
00:22:05,151 --> 00:22:09,652
You play the killer's mother.

232
00:22:09,819 --> 00:22:12,444
How about an autograph?

233
00:22:13,695 --> 00:22:16,570
It's for my girlfriend.
Could you make it personal?

234
00:22:16,737 --> 00:22:19,403
- What's her name?
- Azucena.

235
00:22:21,654 --> 00:22:24,153
THANK YOU FOR SMOKING

236
00:22:31,737 --> 00:22:34,905
- It stopped.
- What's the address?

237
00:22:35,071 --> 00:22:38,697
Thirty-eight Almagro,
but I don't know what floor.

238
00:22:39,737 --> 00:22:41,197
She waved.

239
00:22:42,155 --> 00:22:44,030
Do you think she's on to us?

240
00:22:44,197 --> 00:22:46,030
I don't care.

241
00:22:46,197 --> 00:22:48,156
Where to now?

242
00:22:48,364 --> 00:22:50,489
Montalban, and thank you.

243
00:23:34,326 --> 00:23:37,369
Ladies, there's something
for you to lean on.

244
00:23:37,535 --> 00:23:42,036
Hope it does you more good
than it did me.

245
00:23:42,244 --> 00:23:45,285
Here's your food,
and that's to sleep on.

246
00:23:45,452 --> 00:23:48,036
You can shit on it all you like.

247
00:23:48,245 --> 00:23:50,786
Hey. Jump here. Jump!

248
00:23:50,953 --> 00:23:53,620
She won't jump. She hates it.

249
00:23:53,787 --> 00:23:56,579
Well, back to my waiting.

250
00:24:17,081 --> 00:24:19,248
Number 38 Almagro.

251
00:24:27,915 --> 00:24:30,123
Number 38 Almagro.
Let's see.

252
00:24:30,289 --> 00:24:33,291
Almagro, Almagro,
Almagro.

253
00:24:33,458 --> 00:24:36,915
Thirty-one, 32, 33, 34, 35, 38.

254
00:24:37,999 --> 00:24:39,999
410-0430.

255
00:24:41,041 --> 00:24:43,500
Of course!

256
00:24:44,707 --> 00:24:48,708
Of course. It's the same one
who insulted me this morning.

257
00:24:52,875 --> 00:24:54,375
Hello.

258
00:24:54,583 --> 00:24:58,709
I'm the mother
of the notorious "Crossroads Killer."

259
00:24:58,918 --> 00:25:02,710
When my son comes home
after one of his famous crimes...

260
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:05,251
...his clothes are just filthy.

261
00:25:07,252 --> 00:25:09,377
Where are the clothes
your son wore...

262
00:25:09,585 --> 00:25:11,710
At the time of the murder?

263
00:25:13,252 --> 00:25:16,710
Right here. Sparkling clean.

264
00:25:19,045 --> 00:25:21,378
- No trace of blood.
- Or guts.

265
00:25:21,587 --> 00:25:23,878
Unbelievable.

266
00:25:24,087 --> 00:25:26,628
Ecce Homo. It's unbelievable.

267
00:25:53,631 --> 00:25:57,631
A group of armed Shiites
was captured here in Madrid today...

268
00:25:57,798 --> 00:26:01,048
...according to police sources.

269
00:26:02,132 --> 00:26:06,090
A local Shiite spokesman
living in Madrid...

270
00:26:06,257 --> 00:26:10,882
...stated that the commando group
was acting on its own...

271
00:26:11,091 --> 00:26:15,383
...without any connection
to the Shiite community.

272
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:19,383
The same police sources...

273
00:26:19,591 --> 00:26:21,716
...promise to release
additional information...

274
00:26:21,925 --> 00:26:23,717
...within a few hours...

275
00:26:23,926 --> 00:26:27,050
...after the interrogations
are completed.

276
00:26:29,051 --> 00:26:31,509
Oh, my book!

277
00:26:58,262 --> 00:27:02,845
Ivan, I have to speak to you.
It's urgent.

278
00:27:03,013 --> 00:27:06,553
Leave a message
telling me where and when.

279
00:27:07,638 --> 00:27:10,721
I'm going out
to look for you now. Bye.

280
00:27:13,930 --> 00:27:16,471
It's me, Candela.
I've got to see you.

281
00:27:16,638 --> 00:27:19,389
I'm going out. Call me later.

282
00:27:19,597 --> 00:27:23,430
- I'm in trouble.
- So am I. Goodbye.

283
00:27:24,598 --> 00:27:27,514
Pepa! Damn it, I need you!

284
00:29:25,691 --> 00:29:27,942
- Pepa, it's me.
- That woman!

285
00:29:28,108 --> 00:29:29,817
Pepa, answer.

286
00:29:31,567 --> 00:29:33,942
I'm in big trouble.

287
00:29:37,443 --> 00:29:41,109
"From your dad,
who doesn't deserve you. Ivan."

288
00:29:44,611 --> 00:29:46,735
- What are you doing?
- Making a phone call.

289
00:29:46,902 --> 00:29:48,860
Well, make it!

290
00:29:49,861 --> 00:29:53,235
- Your mother's too much.
- I'm sorry, Marisa.

291
00:29:53,402 --> 00:29:56,361
- And that slut in the window!
- What slut? Where?

292
00:29:56,569 --> 00:29:59,737
Weren't you going to use the phone?
Why don't you use it?

293
00:29:59,903 --> 00:30:01,319
Let's go.

294
00:30:01,487 --> 00:30:04,195
Gather everything and let's go.

295
00:30:39,949 --> 00:30:42,490
"Something's come up
that concerns us both.

296
00:30:42,656 --> 00:30:46,574
I must talk to you
before you leave."

297
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:48,616
Throw that away!

298
00:31:16,868 --> 00:31:19,119
God, I hope he called.

299
00:31:26,786 --> 00:31:29,161
Pepa, it's 5:00 A.M.

300
00:31:29,328 --> 00:31:31,953
I'm across from your place,
and you're still not home.

301
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:37,870
I don't know which end is up
anymore!

302
00:31:40,453 --> 00:31:42,787
I can't explain over the phone.

303
00:31:42,954 --> 00:31:44,287
What a pest!

304
00:31:44,455 --> 00:31:46,662
I'll tell you one thing...

305
00:31:47,412 --> 00:31:51,871
I don't understand,
because if you had a problem...

306
00:31:52,037 --> 00:31:54,914
You'll feel guilty about this!

307
00:32:06,413 --> 00:32:08,581
- It's you.
- I called a million times.

308
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:10,581
You're a drag!

309
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:12,706
Don't say that, or I'll leave.

310
00:32:12,873 --> 00:32:14,707
Come on in.

311
00:32:14,873 --> 00:32:17,249
I've been out all night.

312
00:32:17,457 --> 00:32:18,749
So have I.

313
00:32:18,957 --> 00:32:20,249
Let's have some coffee.

314
00:32:20,457 --> 00:32:23,749
- Going somewhere?
- No. Ivan's leaving me.

315
00:32:23,958 --> 00:32:26,749
- We're doing great.
- My life's a mess.

316
00:32:26,958 --> 00:32:28,250
Mine too.

317
00:32:28,458 --> 00:32:31,708
- Problems at work?
- No. I couldn't tell you on the phone.

318
00:32:31,875 --> 00:32:34,709
The phone! I just ripped it out!

319
00:32:34,876 --> 00:32:37,125
Damn! I'll have to call
the phone company.

320
00:32:37,292 --> 00:32:39,876
Can I stay here?

321
00:32:40,043 --> 00:32:41,876
I'm in big trouble, Pepa!

322
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:46,001
Fix the coffee, then we'll talk.
You're a pain today!

323
00:32:47,126 --> 00:32:48,752
What?

324
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:52,335
Don't call me a pain!
I'm feeling very vulnerable.

325
00:32:57,335 --> 00:32:58,836
My God.

326
00:33:02,003 --> 00:33:04,920
Looks like the work of terrorists.

327
00:33:06,085 --> 00:33:07,836
Oh, the phone...

328
00:33:10,004 --> 00:33:12,254
This just isn't normal.

329
00:33:13,796 --> 00:33:16,337
God, the cops. I'm dead.

330
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:27,505
Hello.

331
00:33:28,338 --> 00:33:30,547
Open up.
We know you're in there.

332
00:33:30,713 --> 00:33:33,547
- What do you want?
- To see the apartment.

333
00:33:33,713 --> 00:33:35,048
- Which one?
- This one.

334
00:33:35,214 --> 00:33:37,881
- Why?
- To rent it.

335
00:33:38,047 --> 00:33:40,298
The real estate agency sent us.

336
00:33:40,465 --> 00:33:42,048
In that case...

337
00:33:43,631 --> 00:33:47,756
Come in. The owner
will be back in a minute.

338
00:33:51,966 --> 00:33:53,799
- Carlos.
- Yes, honey?

339
00:33:53,965 --> 00:33:56,132
It's too high.

340
00:33:56,299 --> 00:33:58,133
Darling, it's a penthouse.

341
00:33:58,299 --> 00:34:00,966
- And expensive.
- Super-expensive.

342
00:34:01,132 --> 00:34:03,759
But it's a great location.

343
00:34:03,925 --> 00:34:07,634
I want a real house,
and this is not a real house.

344
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,300
The girl is right.

345
00:34:09,467 --> 00:34:11,717
Don't call me a girl.

346
00:34:15,801 --> 00:34:17,634
Carlos.

347
00:34:17,801 --> 00:34:19,301
Yes, my love?

348
00:34:19,468 --> 00:34:21,301
You call this great too?

349
00:34:21,468 --> 00:34:22,801
Christ.

350
00:34:26,802 --> 00:34:28,803
Pepa is really something.

351
00:34:28,969 --> 00:34:31,760
Let's go. Come on.

352
00:34:35,803 --> 00:34:38,970
Drop that! You're a cop, right?

353
00:34:39,137 --> 00:34:41,095
My Carlos a cop?
Very funny!

354
00:34:41,261 --> 00:34:42,594
I'm no cop.

355
00:34:42,762 --> 00:34:44,221
Isn't that your father?

356
00:34:44,429 --> 00:34:47,095
Nice people don't touch
what is not theirs.

357
00:34:47,262 --> 00:34:48,596
Why is this here?

358
00:34:48,762 --> 00:34:50,096
I don't know.

359
00:34:50,262 --> 00:34:53,596
- Do you know her?
- That's Pepa.

360
00:34:53,763 --> 00:34:55,429
You know Pepa?

361
00:34:55,596 --> 00:34:57,555
Not personally, no.

362
00:34:57,721 --> 00:34:59,097
Well, here I am.

363
00:35:01,804 --> 00:35:03,263
You know who I am?

364
00:35:04,722 --> 00:35:06,430
Did you see the bed?

365
00:35:06,597 --> 00:35:09,056
I think so, ma'am.
You know who I am?

366
00:35:09,265 --> 00:35:12,890
Since last night.
But don't call me ma'am.

367
00:35:13,723 --> 00:35:15,598
Ivan sent you for his bag?

368
00:35:15,765 --> 00:35:18,723
- No, the realtor sent us.
- What a coincidence.

369
00:35:18,931 --> 00:35:22,099
I'm glad to meet you anyway.

370
00:35:22,265 --> 00:35:24,599
- This is Marisa.
- Who?

371
00:35:24,766 --> 00:35:26,098
Oh, hello.

372
00:35:26,265 --> 00:35:27,640
I'm his fiancée.

373
00:35:27,807 --> 00:35:30,600
Very nice.
I'm his father's ex-lover.

374
00:35:30,766 --> 00:35:32,099
Pepa, listen...

375
00:35:32,266 --> 00:35:33,600
This is Candela.

376
00:35:33,766 --> 00:35:35,434
Pleased to meet you.

377
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,558
Carlos, please.

378
00:35:36,766 --> 00:35:39,683
Pardon the mess.
My life's been hectic lately.

379
00:35:41,809 --> 00:35:43,684
Can you fix telephones?

380
00:35:43,851 --> 00:35:45,851
I can try.

381
00:35:46,017 --> 00:35:48,101
Come with me.

382
00:35:49,684 --> 00:35:51,225
This one's out of order...

383
00:35:51,392 --> 00:35:54,226
...and I'm expecting a call
from your dad.

384
00:35:54,393 --> 00:35:56,226
Candela, make some coffee.

385
00:35:56,393 --> 00:35:57,560
We have to go.

386
00:35:57,727 --> 00:35:59,560
Yeah. Good idea.

387
00:35:59,728 --> 00:36:01,685
Don't be rude.
This is my house.

388
00:36:01,852 --> 00:36:03,853
We've got to talk.

389
00:36:04,019 --> 00:36:05,519
It can't be that urgent!

390
00:36:05,686 --> 00:36:07,519
- Have you any tools?
- Yes, in the kitchen.

391
00:36:07,686 --> 00:36:09,478
I'll go get them.

392
00:36:10,812 --> 00:36:13,062
Is this any time for repairs?

393
00:36:14,312 --> 00:36:17,187
Don't you recognize her?

394
00:36:17,353 --> 00:36:20,480
She was in the phone booth
last night.

395
00:36:21,771 --> 00:36:23,187
I hadn't noticed.

396
00:36:25,312 --> 00:36:27,688
If you don't want me here, say so.

397
00:36:27,854 --> 00:36:29,772
Who says I don't?

398
00:36:29,939 --> 00:36:33,063
I just learned
that my ex-lover has a son.

399
00:36:33,229 --> 00:36:34,897
And he's here.

400
00:36:35,064 --> 00:36:36,688
Shouldn't he come first?

401
00:36:36,855 --> 00:36:38,772
But I've got a big problem.

402
00:36:38,939 --> 00:36:41,106
Okay, we'll talk.

403
00:36:43,314 --> 00:36:45,773
Let me know when we're leaving.

404
00:36:45,981 --> 00:36:47,439
It won't take long.

405
00:36:47,648 --> 00:36:49,106
Here.

406
00:36:50,106 --> 00:36:52,106
Where's Ivan?

407
00:36:52,315 --> 00:36:53,607
I don't know.

408
00:36:53,815 --> 00:36:56,773
Why doesn't he call?
I need to talk to him.

409
00:36:56,982 --> 00:36:58,774
I don't see him very much.

410
00:36:58,982 --> 00:37:02,774
Don't lie.
He's taking a trip with your mom.

411
00:37:02,983 --> 00:37:07,524
My mother thinks
he's going with you.

412
00:37:07,691 --> 00:37:10,025
Then it's someone else.

413
00:37:10,192 --> 00:37:14,026
So that's why
he didn't sleep at his studio!

414
00:37:14,192 --> 00:37:18,984
- How do you know?
- I spent all night keeping watch.

415
00:37:19,151 --> 00:37:20,485
You must think I'm crazy.

416
00:37:20,652 --> 00:37:25,110
No. You're just nervous
from a lack of sleep.

417
00:37:25,277 --> 00:37:26,943
You didn't know about me?

418
00:37:27,151 --> 00:37:29,276
Never. I had no idea.

419
00:37:29,485 --> 00:37:31,443
Ivan never tells me anything.

420
00:37:31,652 --> 00:37:33,444
I just find things out.

421
00:37:33,652 --> 00:37:37,778
Last night,
when I saw your picture...

422
00:37:37,985 --> 00:37:40,278
"From your dad,
who doesn't deserve you. Ivan."

423
00:37:40,445 --> 00:37:42,403
- That's how I knew.

424
00:37:43,319 --> 00:37:46,402
He never says anything,
never admits anything...

425
00:37:46,570 --> 00:37:48,736
...never criticizes.

426
00:37:48,903 --> 00:37:52,237
Do you think I didn't know
he was cheating?

427
00:37:52,404 --> 00:37:55,238
Sure, but I put up with it.

428
00:37:55,404 --> 00:37:59,279
I tried talking to him civilly,
but it didn't work.

429
00:38:00,363 --> 00:38:04,238
So I begged him not to lie
about important things...

430
00:38:04,404 --> 00:38:07,946
...and to tell me
if he stopped loving me.

431
00:38:09,031 --> 00:38:12,572
Last week, I finally got him
to admit he didn't love me.

432
00:38:13,656 --> 00:38:15,614
It was like pulling teeth.

433
00:38:15,823 --> 00:38:20,239
Thanks for listening,
since your father wouldn't.

434
00:38:21,324 --> 00:38:23,990
Waiting for his call
had me ready to choke myself...

435
00:38:24,157 --> 00:38:26,199
...with the telephone cord.

436
00:38:26,365 --> 00:38:29,783
- So I ripped out the phone.
- You did right.

437
00:38:29,949 --> 00:38:33,116
She's gonna jump!

438
00:38:33,282 --> 00:38:34,950
Your friend's jumping!

439
00:38:37,366 --> 00:38:39,199
She jumped!

440
00:38:40,158 --> 00:38:41,326
Help!

441
00:38:41,491 --> 00:38:43,574
Carlos, be careful!

442
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:50,659
Don't let go of me, Pepa!

443
00:38:50,826 --> 00:38:54,660
Oh, my God! I can't do it.

444
00:38:54,826 --> 00:38:56,826
Come on! Pull!

445
00:39:10,495 --> 00:39:12,494
You could have killed yourself!

446
00:39:12,661 --> 00:39:14,953
That was the idea!

447
00:39:16,744 --> 00:39:18,162
I'm desperate.

448
00:39:18,328 --> 00:39:21,828
So am I, and I don't go
jumping off terraces.

449
00:39:22,161 --> 00:39:25,829
Young people don't know
how to fight for things.

450
00:39:25,996 --> 00:39:28,829
You think life is all pleasure.

451
00:39:28,996 --> 00:39:30,496
Well, it isn't.

452
00:39:30,663 --> 00:39:33,454
You have to suffer a lot.

453
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:37,496
Pepa, please.
This isn't the right time.

454
00:39:37,663 --> 00:39:39,956
Yes. I'm sorry.

455
00:39:40,122 --> 00:39:41,621
It's because you scared me.

456
00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:44,372
- Ivan...
- Yes?

457
00:39:44,539 --> 00:39:48,123
I mean Carlos. Bring me
my tranquilizers from the kitchen.

458
00:39:56,165 --> 00:39:58,165
I'm in big trouble.

459
00:39:58,331 --> 00:40:00,332
I can see that.

460
00:40:00,499 --> 00:40:02,832
Carlos, do you love me?

461
00:40:02,999 --> 00:40:05,083
Please, not now.

462
00:40:08,791 --> 00:40:10,833
Okay, what's wrong?

463
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Three months ago,
I spent a weekend with a guy.

464
00:40:15,167 --> 00:40:20,000
I didn't know his name or anything,
but after he left...

465
00:40:20,168 --> 00:40:22,666
...I couldn't get him out of my mind.

466
00:40:22,834 --> 00:40:24,334
What happened that weekend?

467
00:40:24,501 --> 00:40:28,335
Nothing special.
We fucked the whole weekend.

468
00:40:28,501 --> 00:40:32,834
Just thinking about it
gives me goose bumps.

469
00:40:33,001 --> 00:40:36,003
It was like a revelation.

470
00:40:36,169 --> 00:40:39,460
Like making love
for the first time.

471
00:40:42,169 --> 00:40:43,544
I loved it.

472
00:40:43,711 --> 00:40:46,670
Sex means a lot at your age.

473
00:40:47,836 --> 00:40:50,795
Because he's like a terrorist.

474
00:40:50,962 --> 00:40:53,878
He's more intense
than other guys.

475
00:40:54,670 --> 00:40:57,587
I knew he'd be back,
and I'd agree to anything.

476
00:40:57,753 --> 00:40:59,629
He came back?

477
00:40:59,795 --> 00:41:02,587
Two weeks ago,
with two more guys.

478
00:41:02,754 --> 00:41:06,463
- You let them all stay?
- They were with him.

479
00:41:07,505 --> 00:41:10,296
- They took advantage.
- Wait, wait.

480
00:41:10,463 --> 00:41:13,296
I noticed
something weird about them...

481
00:41:13,463 --> 00:41:16,298
...and he confessed
that they were Shiite terrorists.

482
00:41:16,465 --> 00:41:18,798
I flipped. I really did.

483
00:41:18,964 --> 00:41:22,297
I knew it could be dangerous,
but I didn't think about it.

484
00:41:22,464 --> 00:41:25,131
What's worse, they had weapons...

485
00:41:25,298 --> 00:41:27,256
...and were planning
to attack somewhere.

486
00:41:27,464 --> 00:41:29,131
Then I said to him:

487
00:41:29,299 --> 00:41:32,256
"You should have
told me about this."

488
00:41:32,465 --> 00:41:34,424
That's when I realized it was a ploy.

489
00:41:34,632 --> 00:41:37,466
He didn't love me. He used me.

490
00:41:39,341 --> 00:41:41,175
Gazpacho.

491
00:41:43,508 --> 00:41:45,383
You didn't call the cops?

492
00:41:45,550 --> 00:41:46,842
Delicious.

493
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:51,008
How could I?
I was a hostage in my own house.

494
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:53,467
- They were arrested yesterday?
- Yes.

495
00:41:53,634 --> 00:41:58,384
- The ones on TV?
- I threw out all their stuff...

496
00:41:58,551 --> 00:42:00,384
...but if they confess
where they were living...

497
00:42:00,552 --> 00:42:02,843
If they're tortured,
they might tell.

498
00:42:03,009 --> 00:42:05,636
They probably won't tell.

499
00:42:05,843 --> 00:42:09,219
But if they do, the cops will
want me for collaborating...

500
00:42:09,385 --> 00:42:11,677
...and you for not alerting them.

501
00:42:11,844 --> 00:42:14,928
In my house,
I collaborate with whomever I want.

502
00:42:15,094 --> 00:42:17,052
I didn't know where to go.

503
00:42:17,219 --> 00:42:19,886
I couldn't face my folks.

504
00:42:20,053 --> 00:42:22,469
It's bad enough
that I became a model.

505
00:42:22,678 --> 00:42:25,387
You need to see a lawyer.

506
00:42:25,553 --> 00:42:28,886
I'll arrange for that.
You can't leave now.

507
00:42:29,053 --> 00:42:31,346
- Go to Paulina Morales.
- The feminist?

508
00:42:31,513 --> 00:42:33,512
A feminist?

509
00:42:33,679 --> 00:42:36,888
As a woman,
she'll take a personal interest.

510
00:42:37,055 --> 00:42:40,429
I'll go change.
Then give me her address.

511
00:42:46,348 --> 00:42:48,472
Why are men like that?

512
00:42:52,972 --> 00:42:54,806
I really don't understand.

513
00:42:55,014 --> 00:42:58,306
I couldn't stand to be
with a man right now.

514
00:42:58,514 --> 00:43:00,390
That's all I needed!

515
00:43:12,807 --> 00:43:14,141
Help me!

516
00:43:14,349 --> 00:43:16,975
- What happened?
- Nothing. She fell asleep.

517
00:43:17,182 --> 00:43:18,474
So suddenly?

518
00:43:18,683 --> 00:43:22,517
The strangest things
can happen suddenly.

519
00:43:22,683 --> 00:43:24,975
You should know, Candela.

520
00:43:25,184 --> 00:43:26,976
It's true.

521
00:43:27,184 --> 00:43:28,475
But a minute ago...

522
00:43:28,684 --> 00:43:31,977
A minute ago
she wanted to go home...

523
00:43:32,185 --> 00:43:34,310
...but since you ignored her...

524
00:43:34,518 --> 00:43:36,643
...she got depressed
and had some gazpacho.

525
00:43:38,143 --> 00:43:39,935
That made her fall asleep?

526
00:43:40,101 --> 00:43:43,602
Yes. It was spiked with barbiturates.

527
00:43:46,727 --> 00:43:48,518
Sorry.

528
00:43:48,686 --> 00:43:50,478
We could call a doctor.

529
00:43:52,561 --> 00:43:55,603
- What kind of barbiturates?
- Morphidal.

530
00:43:55,770 --> 00:43:58,312
- How many?
- Twenty-five or thirty.

531
00:43:58,519 --> 00:44:01,229
She'll have a good sleep.

532
00:44:12,896 --> 00:44:16,855
Why did you do that?
Were you trying to kill yourself too?

533
00:44:17,896 --> 00:44:21,606
It was for your dad.
He loves gazpacho.

534
00:44:21,772 --> 00:44:24,105
It's no excuse...

535
00:44:24,272 --> 00:44:28,773
...but after waiting for hours,
I just lost control.

536
00:44:28,939 --> 00:44:30,773
That's what happened to me.

537
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:32,898
It could happen to anyone.

538
00:44:36,899 --> 00:44:39,107
Don't get me wrong.

539
00:44:39,274 --> 00:44:43,857
I didn't want to kill him.
Just to make him stay.

540
00:44:44,024 --> 00:44:47,191
I meant to throw it, but...

541
00:44:47,358 --> 00:44:49,191
I understand perfectly.

542
00:44:49,358 --> 00:44:52,025
Thanks. The lawyer's address?

543
00:44:52,192 --> 00:44:54,025
Thirty-one Castellana.

544
00:44:54,192 --> 00:44:56,025
Do you mind staying?

545
00:44:56,192 --> 00:44:58,525
The house is so full of women.

546
00:44:58,691 --> 00:45:02,193
- I'll stay as long as you like.
- Thanks. And fix the phone?

547
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:05,693
- Are you okay?
- A bit shaken, but...

548
00:45:05,859 --> 00:45:08,026
Don't let her near the ledge.
See you later.

549
00:45:08,192 --> 00:45:09,984
Forget it.

550
00:45:21,861 --> 00:45:23,653
Hi, Ana.

551
00:45:28,695 --> 00:45:31,362
Look what fell down from the sky.

552
00:45:31,529 --> 00:45:34,195
It's mine. Thanks.

553
00:45:34,362 --> 00:45:36,070
It seemed strange. Just one.

554
00:45:37,737 --> 00:45:39,153
Be more careful!

555
00:45:39,321 --> 00:45:41,780
Ana was arguing
with her boyfriend...

556
00:45:41,988 --> 00:45:44,655
...and it almost hit her head.

557
00:45:53,614 --> 00:45:55,822
- You again!
- Hope you don't mind.

558
00:45:55,989 --> 00:45:57,573
Thirty-one Castellana.

559
00:45:58,656 --> 00:46:00,990
I'm glad to see you.

560
00:46:01,156 --> 00:46:03,489
My girlfriend loved the autograph.

561
00:46:03,656 --> 00:46:07,781
When I tell her I saw you again,
she'll think we...

562
00:46:30,617 --> 00:46:32,159
Do you have eyedrops?

563
00:46:32,367 --> 00:46:34,784
No. Sorry.

564
00:46:36,368 --> 00:46:38,242
We could buy some.

565
00:46:38,409 --> 00:46:39,660
That's okay.

566
00:46:39,867 --> 00:46:42,784
Why didn't I think of eyedrops?

567
00:46:42,951 --> 00:46:44,910
What a dope!

568
00:46:53,536 --> 00:46:55,536
It's working.

569
00:46:56,870 --> 00:46:58,744
Forget about them.

570
00:46:58,911 --> 00:47:03,245
But they're hijacking
the 10:00 p.m. Stockholm flight...

571
00:47:03,411 --> 00:47:06,412
...and taking it to Beirut
to free some Shiite prisoners.

572
00:47:07,204 --> 00:47:10,746
That flight will be fully booked.
We must report it.

573
00:47:10,913 --> 00:47:12,828
Then the cops will get me too!

574
00:47:13,870 --> 00:47:16,913
I'll talk fast
so they can't trace the call.

575
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:19,622
Yeah. You have a way with words.

576
00:47:27,205 --> 00:47:29,205
Police precinct. Hello.

577
00:47:30,539 --> 00:47:32,914
Tonight's 10:00 p.m. Flight...

578
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:35,081
...to Stockholm...

579
00:47:35,248 --> 00:47:37,749
...will be hijacked
by Shiite terrorists.

580
00:47:37,914 --> 00:47:39,165
Thanks.

581
00:47:59,125 --> 00:48:00,334
Here we are.

582
00:48:00,542 --> 00:48:02,167
Don't tell anyone I cried.

583
00:48:02,376 --> 00:48:04,167
It'll be our secret.

584
00:48:04,376 --> 00:48:05,834
Good.

585
00:48:11,043 --> 00:48:14,334
- Here?
- Where it says "sign."

586
00:48:16,210 --> 00:48:18,210
Is Paulina Morales in?

587
00:48:18,376 --> 00:48:20,668
She's not seeing anyone
this afternoon.

588
00:48:20,877 --> 00:48:24,002
It's urgent. It won't take long.

589
00:48:24,210 --> 00:48:26,670
Come on. You can arrange it.

590
00:48:27,836 --> 00:48:30,169
- Okay. Come on.
- Thanks.

591
00:48:30,836 --> 00:48:32,503
See you later.

592
00:48:37,504 --> 00:48:38,919
Wait here.

593
00:48:42,754 --> 00:48:44,129
I'm coming.

594
00:48:44,295 --> 00:48:45,630
Can I use the phone?

595
00:48:45,796 --> 00:48:47,255
Okay.

596
00:48:56,088 --> 00:48:58,630
Is Paulina there?

597
00:48:58,797 --> 00:49:00,422
Ivan?

598
00:49:02,756 --> 00:49:04,755
I'm going crazy.

599
00:49:17,049 --> 00:49:18,798
"Stockholm."

600
00:49:27,092 --> 00:49:29,091
You can go in.

601
00:49:38,135 --> 00:49:41,384
- Of all the nerve!
- She said I could come in.

602
00:49:41,551 --> 00:49:43,717
I'm in a hurry.

603
00:49:43,884 --> 00:49:47,844
Don't worry.
This won't take long.

604
00:49:49,092 --> 00:49:50,969
May I sit down?

605
00:49:51,135 --> 00:49:52,969
Go ahead.

606
00:49:53,135 --> 00:49:54,968
What's the problem?

607
00:49:55,135 --> 00:49:58,136
A friend of mine is in trouble.

608
00:49:58,301 --> 00:49:59,343
A "problem."

609
00:50:00,261 --> 00:50:03,594
She got involved
with a Shiite terrorist.

610
00:50:05,095 --> 00:50:07,762
I'm dying to smoke. May I?

611
00:50:11,470 --> 00:50:13,386
The shoe is hers.

612
00:50:14,471 --> 00:50:18,346
Anyway, he showed up
with two more Shiites.

613
00:50:18,553 --> 00:50:19,679
Three Shiites.

614
00:50:19,888 --> 00:50:22,638
All three just moved in.

615
00:50:22,805 --> 00:50:24,638
Now they've been arrested...

616
00:50:24,805 --> 00:50:27,347
...and she's scared shitless.

617
00:50:28,097 --> 00:50:29,972
So she needs a lawyer.

618
00:50:30,139 --> 00:50:32,139
Why come to me?

619
00:50:32,347 --> 00:50:34,805
- You're a feminist.
- So?

620
00:50:36,222 --> 00:50:38,181
This is clear-cut chauvinism.

621
00:50:38,389 --> 00:50:41,682
I'm going on a trip.
I'll recommend a colleague.

622
00:50:41,848 --> 00:50:44,014
There's not much to be done.

623
00:50:44,182 --> 00:50:47,140
She must turn herself in,
go to jail...

624
00:50:47,349 --> 00:50:50,473
...and let the jury decide her case.

625
00:50:51,724 --> 00:50:55,307
- I don't understand.
- She's committed a crime.

626
00:50:55,516 --> 00:51:00,100
Her only crime was falling in love
and being afraid.

627
00:51:00,266 --> 00:51:02,016
I'd do the same.

628
00:51:02,308 --> 00:51:03,808
I'm sure.

629
00:51:05,141 --> 00:51:07,142
I don't believe this!

630
00:51:07,350 --> 00:51:10,601
And whom were you crying for?
Your friend?

631
00:51:11,767 --> 00:51:13,725
Not over her.

632
00:51:13,892 --> 00:51:15,559
You see?

633
00:51:15,726 --> 00:51:17,393
Aren't you the victim?

634
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:19,976
Yes. I've also been cheated on.

635
00:51:20,143 --> 00:51:21,476
By a terrorist?

636
00:51:22,477 --> 00:51:24,351
You could say that.

637
00:51:24,518 --> 00:51:26,810
But not a Shiite. He's from Madrid.

638
00:51:26,977 --> 00:51:30,394
I don't give advice to the lovelorn.

639
00:51:30,561 --> 00:51:33,560
You're certainly no lawyer,
you bitch!

640
00:51:33,727 --> 00:51:36,187
Leave, or I'll call the police!

641
00:51:44,020 --> 00:51:45,353
Was it helpful?

642
00:51:45,562 --> 00:51:47,354
Yes. I feel much better.

643
00:51:47,562 --> 00:51:48,936
Good.

644
00:51:53,646 --> 00:51:55,146
What's this doing here?

645
00:51:55,355 --> 00:51:58,604
A kid brought it
and said it's for Mr. Ivan.

646
00:51:58,771 --> 00:52:03,189
If he wants it, let him come upstairs
and show his face!

647
00:52:03,356 --> 00:52:06,022
Fine. Do you need some help?

648
00:52:06,189 --> 00:52:08,646
No, I don't!

649
00:52:10,897 --> 00:52:14,189
Pepa, I'm here in Madrid with you.
That's all I need.

650
00:52:14,356 --> 00:52:19,482
I'm also with you, and I'm so happy
to see you write this card. Pepa.

651
00:52:25,649 --> 00:52:27,316
He called?

652
00:52:31,149 --> 00:52:33,025
Yeah. I answered.

653
00:52:33,191 --> 00:52:34,524
Well? Give me that!

654
00:52:34,691 --> 00:52:39,108
- I shouldn't read your postcards.
- Never mind. What did he say?

655
00:52:39,275 --> 00:52:42,484
He's too embarrassed to see you,
because...

656
00:52:42,651 --> 00:52:44,483
...you know who I am.

657
00:52:44,650 --> 00:52:46,109
How sensitive of him!

658
00:52:46,275 --> 00:52:48,110
I don't want to see him either...

659
00:52:48,276 --> 00:52:51,777
...but if he wants
his damn suitcase...

660
00:52:51,944 --> 00:52:54,151
...he'll have to come and get it!

661
00:52:54,318 --> 00:52:57,111
- How are the girls?
- Fine.

662
00:52:57,277 --> 00:52:58,611
Where's Candela?

663
00:52:58,776 --> 00:53:00,444
In your room.

664
00:53:00,610 --> 00:53:01,944
Did anything happen?

665
00:53:02,110 --> 00:53:05,444
No, no. Did you see the lawyer?

666
00:53:05,611 --> 00:53:08,654
Yes. I'll tell you about it later.

667
00:53:15,736 --> 00:53:18,279
You mind my wearing your dress?

668
00:53:18,446 --> 00:53:21,446
Keep it. It looks nicer on you.

669
00:53:21,612 --> 00:53:24,945
Don't lose it again.
My shoes don't fit you.

670
00:53:25,112 --> 00:53:27,779
- You saw the lawyer?
- Yes.

671
00:53:28,863 --> 00:53:30,779
We're taking a trip.

672
00:53:31,905 --> 00:53:35,489
Running from the law
like two fugitives?

673
00:53:35,655 --> 00:53:39,821
It's best if we take a vacation
away from Madrid.

674
00:53:39,989 --> 00:53:41,822
I sure need one.

675
00:53:41,989 --> 00:53:44,364
I knew they'd lock me up...

676
00:53:44,572 --> 00:53:46,364
...and get you for hiding me.

677
00:53:46,573 --> 00:53:48,365
Nothing will happen.

678
00:53:48,574 --> 00:53:50,531
We'll come back in a week.

679
00:53:50,740 --> 00:53:53,699
You'll go to court
and tell everything...

680
00:53:53,906 --> 00:53:56,365
...except for the fucking,
and that'll be that.

681
00:53:56,574 --> 00:54:00,532
Really? Don't lie to me.
You know I'm naive.

682
00:54:00,740 --> 00:54:03,200
The lawyer said not to worry...

683
00:54:03,366 --> 00:54:07,033
...just to stay in touch with her.

684
00:54:07,242 --> 00:54:09,033
I'm causing so much trouble...

685
00:54:09,241 --> 00:54:12,200
...as if you don't have
enough of your own.

686
00:54:12,367 --> 00:54:14,866
Let's water the plants now.

687
00:54:15,075 --> 00:54:17,117
Then we'll pack our bags.

688
00:54:21,118 --> 00:54:22,993
"Dr. J. Pardo.

689
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:26,702
Test results
on patient Pepa Marcos."

690
00:54:26,910 --> 00:54:28,494
Christ!

691
00:54:33,870 --> 00:54:36,536
- What about the animals?
- I don't know.

692
00:54:36,744 --> 00:54:40,494
Your stepson was
snooping around all day, spying.

693
00:54:40,661 --> 00:54:43,495
It's quite natural,
but he won't find much.

694
00:54:43,662 --> 00:54:45,662
Relax. Let me do that.

695
00:54:45,828 --> 00:54:46,995
Why?

696
00:54:47,161 --> 00:54:49,495
- You feel okay?
- Sure.

697
00:54:49,661 --> 00:54:53,454
You two clean the cage
while I water.

698
00:54:57,746 --> 00:55:00,662
Poor things.
You're going to miss me.

699
00:55:00,830 --> 00:55:02,663
You're depressed.

700
00:55:02,830 --> 00:55:05,496
Just like me.

701
00:55:05,663 --> 00:55:08,163
But you'll come along when I move.

702
00:55:08,330 --> 00:55:10,163
I won't leave you alone.

703
00:55:10,330 --> 00:55:13,789
I'd be a fine one to abandon you.

704
00:55:15,747 --> 00:55:18,457
She's out cold. Let's see.

705
00:55:20,290 --> 00:55:23,957
Anyway, who cares?
Too bad for her.

706
00:55:26,457 --> 00:55:27,999
Poor bunnies!

707
00:55:28,166 --> 00:55:29,832
Look. Totally dry.

708
00:55:29,999 --> 00:55:32,166
Pepa just has
too much on her mind.

709
00:55:32,333 --> 00:55:35,166
Did you ever have rabbits?

710
00:55:35,333 --> 00:55:38,250
Back home I had many.

711
00:55:38,417 --> 00:55:40,333
I know lots about them.

712
00:55:41,916 --> 00:55:45,250
Look how they love turnips.

713
00:55:45,417 --> 00:55:49,750
Carlos, I'm sorry I teased you
about your stuttering.

714
00:55:49,917 --> 00:55:52,584
- Sometimes I'm so dumb.
- Forget it.

715
00:55:52,751 --> 00:55:54,750
But you went a little too far.

716
00:55:54,917 --> 00:55:57,418
You didn't behave properly.

717
00:55:57,584 --> 00:56:00,919
Men keep taking advantage of me.

718
00:56:01,085 --> 00:56:04,418
I always realize it when it's too late.

719
00:56:04,585 --> 00:56:09,752
Look how the Arab world treated me.

720
00:56:09,919 --> 00:56:12,419
I sure didn't deserve that.

721
00:56:20,712 --> 00:56:23,463
This is Lucia.
I need to see you.

722
00:56:23,629 --> 00:56:26,129
I can't. I'm leaving town.

723
00:56:26,296 --> 00:56:27,838
We have to talk.

724
00:56:28,046 --> 00:56:30,754
About something
that concerns us both.

725
00:56:30,921 --> 00:56:34,171
If you mean Ivan,
I'm not interested.

726
00:56:34,337 --> 00:56:36,713
Then why are you
going away with him?

727
00:56:36,921 --> 00:56:38,505
Lady, you're nuts!

728
00:56:38,672 --> 00:56:42,047
Between Ivan and me,
there's nothing but pain.

729
00:56:42,255 --> 00:56:45,589
I'm coming anyway.
I know where you live.

730
00:56:45,756 --> 00:56:49,215
For two days everyone
has been saying "no" to me.

731
00:56:49,381 --> 00:56:51,673
Now it's my turn to say "no."

732
00:56:51,839 --> 00:56:56,257
I must see Ivan
before he leaves.

733
00:56:56,423 --> 00:56:59,673
Look somewhere else
and leave me alone!

734
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:01,048
- That was Mom?
- Yes.

735
00:57:01,257 --> 00:57:02,882
Don't be too hard on her.

736
00:57:03,090 --> 00:57:04,882
The way she talks...

737
00:57:05,049 --> 00:57:07,341
She's mentally ill.

738
00:57:07,508 --> 00:57:09,591
She threatened to come here.

739
00:57:09,757 --> 00:57:12,216
- She shouldn't see you.
- And me?

740
00:57:12,384 --> 00:57:16,175
Fix Marisa some coffee.
We need to talk.

741
00:57:16,342 --> 00:57:19,342
The lawyer didn't work out.
We got into a fight.

742
00:57:19,508 --> 00:57:21,050
She won't defend her?

743
00:57:21,258 --> 00:57:24,051
She'd rather prosecute her.
How'd you meet her?

744
00:57:24,218 --> 00:57:25,468
She was Mom's lawyer.

745
00:57:25,634 --> 00:57:28,343
I'm not surprised
your mother is sick.

746
00:57:29,884 --> 00:57:32,551
They split up before I was born.

747
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:34,593
After my birth, she went crazy...

748
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:36,593
...and was placed
in a mental institution.

749
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:38,427
My grandparents raised me.

750
00:57:39,426 --> 00:57:42,219
They wouldn't let Ivan see me.

751
00:57:42,386 --> 00:57:44,386
You can look now.

752
00:57:48,262 --> 00:57:50,053
Mom was released a year ago.

753
00:57:50,262 --> 00:57:54,388
When she got out,
she wanted to go back to Ivan...

754
00:57:54,553 --> 00:57:56,804
...but he was with you.

755
00:57:56,971 --> 00:57:58,971
Can you zip me up?

756
00:58:00,637 --> 00:58:03,012
So she sued him for millions...

757
00:58:03,180 --> 00:58:06,554
...for all the time
she'd been locked up.

758
00:58:06,721 --> 00:58:08,305
Paulina was her lawyer.

759
00:58:08,472 --> 00:58:10,305
Your mother doesn't mess around.

760
00:58:10,471 --> 00:58:14,222
Paulina tried to sue Ivan,
but it didn't work.

761
00:58:14,389 --> 00:58:16,347
What an insane story.

762
00:58:16,514 --> 00:58:18,056
Mom hates me.

763
00:58:18,264 --> 00:58:21,806
I represent all her years
without Ivan.

764
00:58:21,972 --> 00:58:23,764
Well, I love you.

765
00:58:23,932 --> 00:58:26,723
You're the only good thing
Ivan ever did.

766
00:58:30,139 --> 00:58:33,891
- Oh, it's you.
- I didn't want to interrupt.

767
00:58:34,058 --> 00:58:37,224
- Why so dressed up?
- I'm going out.

768
00:58:37,391 --> 00:58:39,099
Don't mention the lawyer.

769
00:58:39,266 --> 00:58:42,141
- What?
- See if you can wake up Marisa.

770
00:58:42,308 --> 00:58:44,933
- And if not?
- It's up to you.

771
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:47,892
- Anyway, we're leaving.
- What?

772
00:58:48,058 --> 00:58:49,267
- On a trip.
- Where?

773
00:58:49,434 --> 00:58:51,267
- It's a secret.
- We're fugitives.

774
00:58:51,433 --> 00:58:54,017
It's better if you don't know.

775
00:58:54,184 --> 00:58:56,934
- But he knows everything.
- Come on.

776
00:59:04,185 --> 00:59:05,434
What if Ivan calls?

777
00:59:06,977 --> 00:59:09,768
Tell him I expect nothing
from him.

778
00:59:09,935 --> 00:59:12,644
All I have left from him
is the suitcase...

779
00:59:12,811 --> 00:59:14,520
...and I'm getting rid of it now.

780
00:59:15,811 --> 00:59:19,437
No. Don't say anything.

781
00:59:19,603 --> 00:59:21,102
Don't get the phone...

782
00:59:21,270 --> 00:59:22,394
...or the door.

783
00:59:22,562 --> 00:59:23,770
Fine.

784
00:59:24,727 --> 00:59:26,478
I'll be right back.

785
00:59:32,980 --> 00:59:37,229
I overheard about your mom,
and I'm really sorry.

786
00:59:39,313 --> 00:59:41,147
You're a kissing fanatic!

787
00:59:41,313 --> 00:59:43,897
Let's give her some coffee.

788
00:59:56,314 --> 00:59:57,940
What's wrong?

789
00:59:58,107 --> 01:00:00,440
Nothing. She's having fun.

790
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:04,440
I've never seen her like this.

791
01:00:04,607 --> 01:00:07,524
Don't wake her.
She's having a great time.

792
01:00:07,690 --> 01:00:09,400
See her face?

793
01:00:09,567 --> 01:00:11,607
She's having a ball.

794
01:00:12,941 --> 01:00:14,233
Her face!

795
01:00:16,441 --> 01:00:18,025
Look at her lip!

796
01:00:27,109 --> 01:00:30,568
Hi. I've come for my bag.
Pepa said it was here.

797
01:00:30,734 --> 01:00:36,318
That's strange.
A kid brought it down earlier...

798
01:00:36,485 --> 01:00:39,235
...but when Pepa saw it,
she threw a fit.

799
01:00:39,402 --> 01:00:43,403
- So where's the bag?
- She took it and she said:

800
01:00:43,569 --> 01:00:46,110
"If he wants it,
let him come and get it...

801
01:00:46,277 --> 01:00:47,778
...and show his face!"

802
01:00:47,944 --> 01:00:49,944
That's what she said.

803
01:00:50,111 --> 01:00:51,527
She's upstairs now.

804
01:00:51,694 --> 01:00:53,904
I'm in a hurry.

805
01:00:55,445 --> 01:00:57,695
She's probably calmed down...

806
01:00:57,862 --> 01:00:59,571
...but you never know.

807
01:00:59,737 --> 01:01:02,904
I'll be back tomorrow.
Don't tell her I was here.

808
01:01:03,113 --> 01:01:07,654
Sir, I'm a Jehovah's Witness
and cannot tell lies.

809
01:01:07,862 --> 01:01:10,737
Only the truth,
and nothing but the truth.

810
01:01:10,946 --> 01:01:12,196
But if she doesn't ask...

811
01:01:12,363 --> 01:01:15,155
If she asks,
I have to tell the gospel truth.

812
01:01:15,321 --> 01:01:16,863
Goodbye.

813
01:01:17,030 --> 01:01:18,322
I'd like to lie!

814
01:01:18,489 --> 01:01:21,572
The bad thing
about my religion is...

815
01:01:21,738 --> 01:01:23,823
...that we can't.

816
01:01:30,656 --> 01:01:35,698
I love the sound of the trumpets
on Judgment Day

817
01:01:37,949 --> 01:01:41,907
Ivan, I have to speak
to you immediately.

818
01:01:42,116 --> 01:01:45,532
Leave a message
and tell me when and where.

819
01:01:47,533 --> 01:01:49,283
I can't pick up my bag.

820
01:01:49,450 --> 01:01:51,616
I wanted to talk to you...

821
01:01:51,783 --> 01:01:55,075
...but I see you're avoiding me.

822
01:01:55,241 --> 01:01:58,325
I'll try again in a few days...

823
01:01:58,492 --> 01:02:00,575
...when you're a bit calmer.

824
01:02:00,784 --> 01:02:04,243
I want you to know
that our years together...

825
01:02:04,410 --> 01:02:07,784
...were the best of my life.

826
01:02:09,202 --> 01:02:11,576
I'm not going away
with any woman.

827
01:02:13,993 --> 01:02:16,243
Goodbye, sweetheart.

828
01:02:16,410 --> 01:02:19,369
I wish you the best
with all my heart.

829
01:02:19,703 --> 01:02:24,703
I'm so unhappy

830
01:02:24,912 --> 01:02:28,203
Because you no longer love me

831
01:02:28,370 --> 01:02:32,161
Why should I try
to change your mind

832
01:02:34,204 --> 01:02:38,913
Be happy, my love

833
01:02:39,079 --> 01:02:45,538
For I'll never forget
the love you gave me

834
01:02:48,205 --> 01:02:51,538
I'm so unhappy

835
01:02:54,498 --> 01:02:57,247
Look at him!

836
01:02:57,540 --> 01:02:59,082
He's nuts!

837
01:03:12,416 --> 01:03:14,041
I'll show her, all right!

838
01:03:14,249 --> 01:03:17,707
Pepa, you'll pay dearly
for those three Shiites!

839
01:03:19,375 --> 01:03:21,875
I'm not going away
with any women.

840
01:03:22,082 --> 01:03:24,375
Goodbye, sweetheart.
I wish you the best...

841
01:03:24,542 --> 01:03:26,083
Liar!

842
01:03:26,416 --> 01:03:27,875
Maybe it's true.

843
01:03:28,042 --> 01:03:30,334
He can fool me with everything
but his voice.

844
01:03:30,500 --> 01:03:35,001
I know all his intonations.
I worked long enough with him.

845
01:03:35,167 --> 01:03:36,793
Goddamn phone!

846
01:03:37,918 --> 01:03:39,751
What were you doing?

847
01:03:41,251 --> 01:03:43,919
That damn fucking bitch!

848
01:03:44,794 --> 01:03:46,293
What did you see in her?

849
01:03:46,460 --> 01:03:47,918
Let's get your luggage.

850
01:03:48,253 --> 01:03:49,795
- You did it again.
- Forget it.

851
01:03:49,961 --> 01:03:53,544
Calm down!
Just look at this place.

852
01:03:55,295 --> 01:03:59,045
- The cops!
- Take it easy. Come on.

853
01:03:59,211 --> 01:04:00,795
It's Ivan.
I knew he's no coward.

854
01:04:00,961 --> 01:04:02,962
It's your mother.

855
01:04:03,129 --> 01:04:04,421
- Let's play.
- I can't!

856
01:04:04,587 --> 01:04:06,462
- Should I let her in?
- Yes.

857
01:04:06,628 --> 01:04:09,505
- Read the instructions!
- "Strategy is..."

858
01:04:09,671 --> 01:04:11,253
Not out loud!

859
01:04:14,505 --> 01:04:17,338
What are you doing here,
traitor?

860
01:04:17,505 --> 01:04:20,297
- Well...
- Carlos, who is it?

861
01:04:20,462 --> 01:04:21,880
I don't know.

862
01:04:22,047 --> 01:04:23,255
It's the police.

863
01:04:25,173 --> 01:04:26,630
What do they want?

864
01:04:27,964 --> 01:04:31,548
We understood.

865
01:04:31,755 --> 01:04:33,840
- Come on.
- Right.

866
01:04:34,923 --> 01:04:37,465
Shut up or I'll smack you.

867
01:04:43,591 --> 01:04:45,007
Good evening.

868
01:04:45,174 --> 01:04:47,590
Is she with you?

869
01:04:47,757 --> 01:04:49,674
We met in the elevator.

870
01:04:57,091 --> 01:04:59,509
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

871
01:04:59,675 --> 01:05:03,301
- Just discussing the lady's dress.
- It's awful.

872
01:05:03,467 --> 01:05:06,008
- It's just a dress.
- But it's awful.

873
01:05:06,175 --> 01:05:07,550
Maybe she likes it.

874
01:05:07,718 --> 01:05:12,093
Stop acting like a kid
in front of the policemen!

875
01:05:15,510 --> 01:05:18,469
"I love you, need you, want you."

876
01:05:19,678 --> 01:05:21,676
"Your Ivan."

877
01:05:21,843 --> 01:05:24,136
May I ask why you're here?

878
01:05:24,303 --> 01:05:26,760
A call was made
from your telephone...

879
01:05:26,927 --> 01:05:28,386
...about some terrorists.

880
01:05:28,594 --> 01:05:30,429
Pardon?

881
01:05:30,594 --> 01:05:35,054
Someone called from here
about the Shiite terrorists.

882
01:05:35,262 --> 01:05:37,220
See! I told you!

883
01:05:37,387 --> 01:05:39,388
Those kids!

884
01:05:39,595 --> 01:05:44,429
There's been some mistake.
My phone's been out of order all day.

885
01:05:44,638 --> 01:05:46,637
She just now pulled it out.

886
01:05:46,805 --> 01:05:49,096
I called her 20 minutes ago.

887
01:05:49,304 --> 01:05:51,263
Ignore her. She's a bit crazy.

888
01:05:51,430 --> 01:05:54,388
- What am I charged with?
- Nothing.

889
01:05:54,597 --> 01:05:58,055
We just wanted information
about who called.

890
01:05:58,222 --> 01:05:59,472
Who ripped out the phone?

891
01:05:59,639 --> 01:06:01,764
I did. This morning.

892
01:06:01,931 --> 01:06:03,973
So nobody's called
from here today.

893
01:06:04,139 --> 01:06:06,056
Pepa's some talker!

894
01:06:06,222 --> 01:06:07,431
Why?

895
01:06:07,598 --> 01:06:11,223
I was expecting a call.
They didn't call, and I got upset.

896
01:06:11,390 --> 01:06:13,848
Who? Ivan? Where is he?

897
01:06:14,015 --> 01:06:17,223
Shut up. I'll ask the questions.
Well, we will.

898
01:06:17,390 --> 01:06:20,100
Go ahead. Ask her who Ivan is.

899
01:06:20,307 --> 01:06:23,099
- Who's Ivan?
- The cause of this mess...

900
01:06:23,266 --> 01:06:25,600
...and of the mess
your partner's about to see.

901
01:06:27,433 --> 01:06:29,266
He's going to find Marisa.

902
01:06:29,433 --> 01:06:30,517
All right. Explain.

903
01:06:30,684 --> 01:06:32,725
May I sit down?

904
01:06:34,309 --> 01:06:37,642
If I'm to bare my soul,
I'd rather be comfortable.

905
01:06:37,809 --> 01:06:39,601
I've had a hard day.

906
01:06:39,767 --> 01:06:41,101
Are you comfortable?

907
01:06:41,476 --> 01:06:43,935
I'd be more comfortable
alone with my friends...

908
01:06:44,101 --> 01:06:45,435
...playing Strategy.

909
01:06:45,602 --> 01:06:48,143
You can't always
have everything.

910
01:06:48,310 --> 01:06:50,018
We agree on that.

911
01:06:50,185 --> 01:06:52,727
Who is this Ivan?

912
01:06:52,894 --> 01:06:56,977
He was my lover.
Before that he was with her.

913
01:06:57,144 --> 01:06:59,561
He's my son's father.

914
01:06:59,728 --> 01:07:02,019
Him?
What's he doing here?

915
01:07:02,186 --> 01:07:04,228
He came to rent my apartment.

916
01:07:04,437 --> 01:07:05,437
I didn't know.

917
01:07:05,603 --> 01:07:08,770
I get the feeling
you're pulling my leg.

918
01:07:08,937 --> 01:07:12,270
You think I like
baring my soul to strangers?

919
01:07:12,437 --> 01:07:15,480
Well, you're wrong.
It's humiliating.

920
01:07:15,646 --> 01:07:17,271
Damn it, Mom!

921
01:07:17,437 --> 01:07:19,896
- Candela, get me a drink.
- What kind?

922
01:07:20,063 --> 01:07:22,605
- There's gazpacho.
- Right! Gazpacho!

923
01:07:22,771 --> 01:07:24,271
Let's go.

924
01:07:26,021 --> 01:07:28,772
- Where are you going?
- For gazpacho. Want some?

925
01:07:28,938 --> 01:07:31,771
We're on duty,
but we don't want to be rude...

926
01:07:31,938 --> 01:07:34,148
Gazpacho for everyone.

927
01:07:34,314 --> 01:07:36,398
Is she sleeping?

928
01:07:36,605 --> 01:07:39,273
Like a log.
She's Carlos' fiancée.

929
01:07:39,439 --> 01:07:42,690
She was tired.
You want me to wake her up?

930
01:07:42,857 --> 01:07:44,482
Not yet.

931
01:07:44,649 --> 01:07:48,524
Why don't you sit down?
I'm getting a stiff neck.

932
01:07:56,941 --> 01:07:59,108
We have nothing against you...

933
01:07:59,275 --> 01:08:00,650
Thanks a lot.

934
01:08:00,817 --> 01:08:03,609
Without being inquisitive...

935
01:08:03,775 --> 01:08:06,275
...you must admit
this is a little weird.

936
01:08:06,442 --> 01:08:08,358
A charred bedroom...

937
01:08:08,525 --> 01:08:10,109
...a broken phone,
a smashed window...

938
01:08:10,276 --> 01:08:12,776
It's been weird, all right.

939
01:08:12,942 --> 01:08:15,276
Okay. Start at the beginning.

940
01:08:15,443 --> 01:08:17,693
And make it clear,
concise, and fair.

941
01:08:17,859 --> 01:08:19,068
I don't know if I can.

942
01:08:19,235 --> 01:08:21,943
I'm too hurt to be clear,
concise, and fair.

943
01:08:22,110 --> 01:08:23,110
Words!

944
01:08:23,277 --> 01:08:26,402
- Just the facts.
- Okay.

945
01:08:26,568 --> 01:08:28,944
I lived here with Ivan.

946
01:08:29,110 --> 01:08:32,611
We loved each other.
At least, I loved him.

947
01:08:32,778 --> 01:08:36,653
After months of trying
to keep our love together...

948
01:08:37,736 --> 01:08:39,778
...we split up a week ago.

949
01:08:39,945 --> 01:08:44,404
He told me to pack his bags.
He'd be taking a trip...

950
01:08:44,612 --> 01:08:46,195
...with another woman.

951
01:08:46,362 --> 01:08:49,112
- He said that?
- He never travels alone.

952
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:52,988
Remember, these two
for the cops. An extra dose.

953
01:08:53,154 --> 01:08:54,905
Careful.

954
01:08:55,072 --> 01:08:56,946
This is too warm.

955
01:09:00,156 --> 01:09:01,613
Carlos, my God!

956
01:09:01,780 --> 01:09:05,573
In front of your mother,
the cops, your fiancée!

957
01:09:05,739 --> 01:09:06,947
Aren't you afraid?

958
01:09:07,114 --> 01:09:09,198
Go on, please.

959
01:09:09,365 --> 01:09:12,114
So I packed up his stuff
and went to work.

960
01:09:12,281 --> 01:09:15,032
When I came back,
the house was like this.

961
01:09:15,198 --> 01:09:17,824
Except for the phone,
which I did.

962
01:09:17,990 --> 01:09:20,532
The suitcase was gone...

963
01:09:20,699 --> 01:09:23,365
...and the bed was all burned.

964
01:09:23,532 --> 01:09:28,199
They're taking very long.
Go. Check.

965
01:09:29,783 --> 01:09:32,950
They're probably kissing.

966
01:09:33,157 --> 01:09:35,034
- What about Marisa?
- She'd better wake up.

967
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:37,575
Takes after his father.

968
01:09:38,617 --> 01:09:40,992
- Now, who's that?
- Yeah?

969
01:09:41,159 --> 01:09:43,159
- Telephone repair. And you?
- Police.

970
01:09:43,325 --> 01:09:46,035
- Your I.D.?
- And yours?

971
01:09:54,452 --> 01:09:56,285
Are you the lady
who called this morning?

972
01:09:56,451 --> 01:10:00,285
Yes. Here's the phone,
and here's the plug.

973
01:10:00,494 --> 01:10:03,453
I reached her here by phone
20 minutes ago.

974
01:10:03,619 --> 01:10:05,203
There she goes again!

975
01:10:05,369 --> 01:10:07,244
Not on this phone.

976
01:10:07,411 --> 01:10:09,120
Let's get to the point.

977
01:10:09,287 --> 01:10:13,412
Do you know
any Shiite terrorists?

978
01:10:13,619 --> 01:10:15,746
Shut up! He's asking her!

979
01:10:15,912 --> 01:10:18,287
I didn't know Madrid had any.

980
01:10:19,579 --> 01:10:21,204
Do you know them?

981
01:10:21,370 --> 01:10:24,579
Not me. I'm not into politics.

982
01:10:24,746 --> 01:10:26,746
Sure, man.
They were on TV today!

983
01:10:26,912 --> 01:10:29,789
- Shut up!
- You want the TV on?

984
01:10:29,955 --> 01:10:32,746
I'm not interested in Shiites.

985
01:10:32,913 --> 01:10:34,455
Ma'am, what about you?

986
01:10:34,623 --> 01:10:38,039
Pepa and I have
important things to discuss.

987
01:10:38,205 --> 01:10:39,372
Men, right?

988
01:10:39,539 --> 01:10:40,747
What's more important?

989
01:10:40,914 --> 01:10:43,164
Fine. We'll talk about men.

990
01:10:45,998 --> 01:10:49,040
Is Ivan involved
with these terrorists?

991
01:10:50,457 --> 01:10:54,290
- Relax.
- Ivan?

992
01:10:54,457 --> 01:10:56,748
I don't know.
He's hidden so many things from me.

993
01:10:56,916 --> 01:10:58,874
Can you give me his address...

994
01:11:00,166 --> 01:11:01,375
...or phone number?

995
01:11:01,541 --> 01:11:05,541
He has no phone.
And he's not home.

996
01:11:05,708 --> 01:11:07,791
I told you he's leaving town.

997
01:11:07,958 --> 01:11:09,292
Try the airport.

998
01:11:10,458 --> 01:11:13,417
The airport? Where's he going?

999
01:11:37,752 --> 01:11:39,253
Where is he going?

1000
01:11:39,586 --> 01:11:43,295
To Stockholm. Tonight.
With Paulina Morales.

1001
01:11:43,586 --> 01:11:45,545
Stockholm!

1002
01:11:45,712 --> 01:11:47,879
Why didn't you say so before?

1003
01:11:48,212 --> 01:11:50,629
Because I just figured it out.

1004
01:11:51,754 --> 01:11:54,838
Now I understand it all.

1005
01:11:55,004 --> 01:11:56,546
The phone call.

1006
01:11:56,712 --> 01:12:00,463
What an idiot I am!
Why didn't I see it before?

1007
01:12:01,796 --> 01:12:04,088
Your lawyer
played it beautifully.

1008
01:12:04,255 --> 01:12:07,922
You didn't know
they'd be hijacking that flight?

1009
01:12:10,256 --> 01:12:11,797
The Shiites?

1010
01:12:15,298 --> 01:12:19,132
The whole country knows.
It was on TV.

1011
01:12:19,298 --> 01:12:21,756
But the tip
came from this phone.

1012
01:12:21,923 --> 01:12:24,632
I want to know
who the hell called...

1013
01:12:24,799 --> 01:12:27,215
...or I'll haul you all in!

1014
01:12:28,507 --> 01:12:31,216
Why aren't you at the airport?

1015
01:12:31,382 --> 01:12:34,800
There are more cops there
than passengers.

1016
01:12:35,883 --> 01:12:38,425
I don't know what's going on...

1017
01:12:38,592 --> 01:12:40,591
...but if you don't start talking...

1018
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:43,550
Chief, this stuff has been spiked.

1019
01:12:46,134 --> 01:12:48,134
What's in the gazpacho?

1020
01:12:48,301 --> 01:12:51,051
Tomatoes, cucumbers...

1021
01:12:51,218 --> 01:12:54,051
...bell pepper, onion...

1022
01:12:54,218 --> 01:12:55,635
...one garlic clove...

1023
01:12:57,759 --> 01:13:01,010
...oil, salt, vinegar...

1024
01:13:01,177 --> 01:13:03,552
...some day-old bread, and water.

1025
01:13:03,719 --> 01:13:06,261
The secret's in mixing it right.

1026
01:13:06,427 --> 01:13:09,094
Ivan loves the way I mix it.

1027
01:13:09,260 --> 01:13:10,469
I made it for him.

1028
01:13:12,428 --> 01:13:13,970
You collect weapons?

1029
01:13:14,136 --> 01:13:15,303
Get back!

1030
01:13:15,886 --> 01:13:19,637
Move back. I don't want
to hurt the kids.

1031
01:13:19,804 --> 01:13:22,428
Is Ivan really going
to Stockholm?

1032
01:13:22,594 --> 01:13:25,304
It's just a hunch,
but I'm pretty sure.

1033
01:13:25,471 --> 01:13:27,637
What did you have to tell him?

1034
01:13:27,804 --> 01:13:29,888
Nothing, now.

1035
01:13:30,055 --> 01:13:32,929
I just want to forget him.

1036
01:13:33,096 --> 01:13:35,805
And you should do the same.

1037
01:13:35,972 --> 01:13:38,680
In the hospital,
I had forgotten him.

1038
01:13:38,847 --> 01:13:41,389
I didn't remember anything.

1039
01:13:41,556 --> 01:13:43,097
Until suddenly...

1040
01:13:43,263 --> 01:13:47,388
...one night,
I heard his voice on TV.

1041
01:13:47,556 --> 01:13:49,431
I didn't recognize his face...

1042
01:13:49,598 --> 01:13:51,599
...just his voice.

1043
01:13:51,807 --> 01:13:53,932
He was telling a woman
he loved her.

1044
01:13:54,099 --> 01:13:57,931
I felt a spasm inside me.

1045
01:13:58,098 --> 01:14:01,599
I remembered all the times
he's said that to me.

1046
01:14:03,557 --> 01:14:05,975
I regained my sanity
and my memory.

1047
01:14:06,142 --> 01:14:07,516
From that moment on...

1048
01:14:07,683 --> 01:14:10,933
...I acted as if I had been cured...

1049
01:14:11,100 --> 01:14:13,100
...and they released me.

1050
01:14:13,308 --> 01:14:15,975
If you're cured,
stop aiming at me.

1051
01:14:16,143 --> 01:14:20,101
But I'm not cured.

1052
01:14:20,309 --> 01:14:23,434
I faked it, and I fooled them.

1053
01:14:23,601 --> 01:14:27,143
I can only forget him
by killing him.

1054
01:14:27,309 --> 01:14:30,310
How will you do that?

1055
01:14:30,477 --> 01:14:31,935
At the airport.

1056
01:14:32,101 --> 01:14:36,103
The airport is full of cops.
You heard him.

1057
01:14:36,269 --> 01:14:37,727
I'll manage.

1058
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:40,269
Now that you know...

1059
01:14:41,436 --> 01:14:43,352
Let's drink a toast.

1060
01:14:55,020 --> 01:14:56,771
Drink!

1061
01:14:57,520 --> 01:14:58,687
You too.

1062
01:15:10,439 --> 01:15:12,438
Oh, my eyes!

1063
01:15:21,398 --> 01:15:22,647
My eyes!

1064
01:15:26,649 --> 01:15:28,773
She left the door open!

1065
01:15:28,940 --> 01:15:30,941
The door!

1066
01:15:43,149 --> 01:15:45,567
Take me to the airport,
please.

1067
01:15:45,733 --> 01:15:47,191
Sorry. I have a date.

1068
01:15:47,358 --> 01:15:48,900
Take me!

1069
01:15:49,066 --> 01:15:51,734
- What the hell is that?
- A gun. Let's go.

1070
01:15:51,901 --> 01:15:53,525
My girlfriend will be mad.

1071
01:15:53,692 --> 01:15:58,109
Not as mad as I'll be.
Quick, to Stockholm!

1072
01:16:07,610 --> 01:16:10,027
Right under my nose!

1073
01:16:10,194 --> 01:16:11,486
Did you see that?

1074
01:16:11,653 --> 01:16:13,444
Come on. After them!

1075
01:16:15,069 --> 01:16:16,737
You again! Great!

1076
01:16:16,903 --> 01:16:19,361
We're meant for each other!

1077
01:16:19,527 --> 01:16:21,278
Whom do we follow today?

1078
01:16:21,445 --> 01:16:23,737
- That motorcycle!
- That Harley!

1079
01:16:26,321 --> 01:16:28,112
I'll do my best.

1080
01:16:28,279 --> 01:16:29,695
To the airport!

1081
01:16:29,862 --> 01:16:31,946
Blow on my eyes.

1082
01:16:32,113 --> 01:16:35,654
That lady is crazy,
and she carries two guns.

1083
01:16:35,821 --> 01:16:39,237
- Why did she take Ambite?
- Because she's in a hurry.

1084
01:16:39,405 --> 01:16:42,321
Ah! Eyedrops!

1085
01:16:42,488 --> 01:16:44,321
Anything else, ladies?

1086
01:16:44,488 --> 01:16:48,489
No. Just step on it.
That lady is dangerous.

1087
01:16:48,655 --> 01:16:51,615
No lady's dangerous
if you know how to handle her.

1088
01:16:51,781 --> 01:16:54,115
- There they are.
- I've got them.

1089
01:16:54,281 --> 01:16:55,281
I can't see.

1090
01:16:55,448 --> 01:16:58,447
He can never say "no."

1091
01:16:58,656 --> 01:17:01,490
Ana, that lady has two guns,
and she's a nut.

1092
01:17:01,657 --> 01:17:04,073
Look what she did to me!

1093
01:17:04,240 --> 01:17:07,283
You think I go around
like this for fun?

1094
01:17:07,490 --> 01:17:10,074
She's capable of anything!

1095
01:17:10,949 --> 01:17:14,158
My ass is the only one
allowed on that bike.

1096
01:17:14,324 --> 01:17:16,533
I'm fed up.

1097
01:17:16,700 --> 01:17:19,116
I'm gonna get myself
some quick cash...

1098
01:17:19,283 --> 01:17:20,741
...buy myself his bike and split.

1099
01:17:20,908 --> 01:17:22,159
With a bike...

1100
01:17:22,326 --> 01:17:24,200
...who needs a man?

1101
01:17:24,367 --> 01:17:27,284
Learning mechanics is easier
than learning male psychology.

1102
01:17:28,325 --> 01:17:30,826
You can figure out a bike...

1103
01:17:30,993 --> 01:17:33,909
...but you can never
figure out a man.

1104
01:17:34,993 --> 01:17:37,118
She's going for his balls!

1105
01:17:37,327 --> 01:17:39,868
I think she's just
trying to hang on.

1106
01:17:40,035 --> 01:17:42,286
Fresh out of the mental ward...

1107
01:17:42,451 --> 01:17:44,327
...and she looks
like a professional biker.

1108
01:17:58,495 --> 01:18:01,370
Be careful! She's crazy!

1109
01:18:01,538 --> 01:18:02,829
And she has a gun!

1110
01:18:04,079 --> 01:18:05,537
Bitch!

1111
01:18:05,704 --> 01:18:07,288
Get down!

1112
01:18:15,372 --> 01:18:18,372
Shut up, idiot women!

1113
01:18:25,706 --> 01:18:27,664
Leave my man alone!

1114
01:18:47,833 --> 01:18:50,208
Can't you go any faster?

1115
01:18:50,375 --> 01:18:52,916
Lady, this thing is a relic.

1116
01:18:53,083 --> 01:18:56,000
A relic?
Just remember this gun!

1117
01:18:56,167 --> 01:18:57,625
Okay! Don't shoot!

1118
01:19:06,627 --> 01:19:08,501
Don't you sell guns?

1119
01:19:08,668 --> 01:19:10,168
I don't need them.

1120
01:19:10,334 --> 01:19:12,044
What if you're held up?

1121
01:19:12,211 --> 01:19:14,126
I avoid danger, just like now.

1122
01:19:14,293 --> 01:19:17,960
Sorry, ladies.
The chase is over.

1123
01:19:18,127 --> 01:19:22,128
Please, just take us
to the airport somehow.

1124
01:19:22,336 --> 01:19:25,212
I'm a taxi driver,
not a bounty hunter.

1125
01:19:25,378 --> 01:19:27,795
I warned you
she was a dangerous woman.

1126
01:19:27,961 --> 01:19:29,670
He said he could deal.

1127
01:19:50,422 --> 01:19:51,839
Right here.

1128
01:19:55,423 --> 01:19:56,756
Thanks.

1129
01:20:02,674 --> 01:20:04,673
Stockholm, please?

1130
01:20:04,839 --> 01:20:07,257
International flights
are over there.

1131
01:20:54,344 --> 01:20:56,761
- You're weak, Ivan.
- Yes, sweetheart.

1132
01:20:56,928 --> 01:21:00,470
- Don't agree with me!
- But you're right.

1133
01:21:00,636 --> 01:21:03,761
Sometimes I like to be wrong.

1134
01:21:59,308 --> 01:22:03,350
Take me back to the hospital.
That's my home.

1135
01:22:26,103 --> 01:22:27,978
Are you all right?

1136
01:22:28,145 --> 01:22:29,936
Let go.

1137
01:22:30,103 --> 01:22:32,520
You saved my life, darling.

1138
01:22:32,687 --> 01:22:36,521
Don't worry.
I don't want anything in return.

1139
01:22:36,687 --> 01:22:39,145
Just one thing.
Tell her to go away!

1140
01:22:40,354 --> 01:22:41,855
Go away!

1141
01:22:45,354 --> 01:22:47,855
Pepa, I'm ashamed.

1142
01:22:48,022 --> 01:22:51,188
I've treated you so badly.

1143
01:22:51,355 --> 01:22:53,438
All I wanted was to talk to you.

1144
01:22:53,604 --> 01:22:55,897
I've spent two days waiting...

1145
01:22:56,064 --> 01:22:58,647
...looking for you,
leaving messages.

1146
01:22:58,814 --> 01:23:00,814
We can talk tonight.

1147
01:23:01,022 --> 01:23:02,814
The trip to Stockholm can wait.

1148
01:23:02,981 --> 01:23:05,356
No. It's too late now.

1149
01:23:05,523 --> 01:23:06,856
Don't hold a grudge.

1150
01:23:07,023 --> 01:23:10,648
Let's have a drink,
now, in the cafeteria.

1151
01:23:12,690 --> 01:23:14,815
Yesterday, this morning,
or even at noon today...

1152
01:23:15,023 --> 01:23:16,733
...we could have.

1153
01:23:16,899 --> 01:23:18,565
But now it's too late.

1154
01:23:18,732 --> 01:23:21,024
It's been too late
for the past two hours.

1155
01:23:21,191 --> 01:23:25,191
Then why did you come out here?

1156
01:23:25,357 --> 01:23:28,483
Lucia wanted to kill you...

1157
01:23:28,691 --> 01:23:32,692
...and I came to stop her.

1158
01:23:32,859 --> 01:23:36,025
Since you're out of danger,
I'm leaving.

1159
01:23:37,735 --> 01:23:39,442
Goodbye.

1160
01:24:04,570 --> 01:24:06,362
Home at last!

1161
01:24:07,529 --> 01:24:09,487
The visitors...

1162
01:24:09,653 --> 01:24:11,821
...are comfortable.

1163
01:24:11,987 --> 01:24:14,278
And the kids?

1164
01:24:14,445 --> 01:24:17,821
Candela really manages
to recover quickly.

1165
01:24:17,988 --> 01:24:20,697
Hope he's luckier for her
than the Shiites were.

1166
01:24:21,780 --> 01:24:23,530
God, what a mess!

1167
01:24:23,696 --> 01:24:25,822
The maid comes tomorrow.

1168
01:24:25,988 --> 01:24:28,780
Better wear shoes
with this mess.

1169
01:24:28,947 --> 01:24:31,239
I wonder which is better...

1170
01:24:31,405 --> 01:24:35,114
...slipping on gazpacho,
or cutting myself on the glass.

1171
01:24:35,280 --> 01:24:39,031
The repairman is a doll, but
I'd better save him for Marisa.

1172
01:24:48,615 --> 01:24:51,032
I fell asleep.

1173
01:24:51,199 --> 01:24:52,491
How do you feel?

1174
01:24:52,657 --> 01:24:55,699
Like new. But you don't look so hot.

1175
01:24:55,866 --> 01:24:59,074
Well, I'm going to have a baby.

1176
01:24:59,241 --> 01:25:00,783
I didn't know.

1177
01:25:00,950 --> 01:25:02,992
You're the first person
I've told.

1178
01:25:03,200 --> 01:25:06,159
Congratulations!
You should sit here.

1179
01:25:11,867 --> 01:25:13,076
I'll explain tomorrow.

1180
01:25:13,243 --> 01:25:15,159
- But...
- Sit down.

1181
01:25:15,326 --> 01:25:19,243
You just woke up,
but I haven't slept in two days.

1182
01:25:21,035 --> 01:25:23,286
I won't sublet it.

1183
01:25:23,453 --> 01:25:25,201
I love the view.

1184
01:25:27,702 --> 01:25:29,661
Yeah, it's gorgeous.

1185
01:25:31,994 --> 01:25:33,537
How long was I asleep?

1186
01:25:33,703 --> 01:25:35,411
Hours!

1187
01:25:35,578 --> 01:25:37,745
You have beautiful skin.

1188
01:25:39,536 --> 01:25:41,871
I had a dream.

1189
01:25:42,037 --> 01:25:44,661
- A good one?
- I think so.

1190
01:25:46,496 --> 01:25:48,870
I was a virgin this morning...

1191
01:25:49,038 --> 01:25:50,663
...but I don't think I am now.

1192
01:25:50,829 --> 01:25:54,705
- Don't tell me one of these jerks...
- No. It was in my dream!

1193
01:25:54,871 --> 01:25:56,747
Great!

1194
01:25:56,913 --> 01:25:58,913
Actually, you've lost...

1195
01:25:59,080 --> 01:26:01,038
...that hard look
that virgins have.

1196
01:26:01,205 --> 01:26:02,247
Virgins are awful.
