1
00:00:12,078 --> 00:00:15,445
Since some time, some
raids conducted by fake CBI..

2
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:17,710
...has come up before CBI enquiry.

3
00:00:17,784 --> 00:00:21,743
Call us on this phone number
for any doubtful situation.

4
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:54,302
Hello, sir.

5
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:56,672
Why do you want to join the bureau?

6
00:02:57,043 --> 00:02:57,839
What, sir?

7
00:02:57,911 --> 00:03:00,744
Intelligence. CBl. Why
do you want to join it?

8
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:03,281
There's a lot of
corruption in our country.

9
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:05,040
The entire system's in a mess.

10
00:03:05,118 --> 00:03:07,552
Our enemies are weakening our system.

11
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:10,589
We need to uproot the enemies, sir.

12
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:11,984
Will you uproot them?

13
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:14,892
We'll do it together, sir.

14
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:16,992
You... and me.

15
00:05:27,927 --> 00:05:29,622
Republic Day.

16
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:33,927
'Republic' is a word, which,
if you look up its meaning..

17
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,460
...you see a the picture
of a group of people..

18
00:05:38,571 --> 00:05:42,905
...which guides them to follow rules.

19
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:46,570
The same republic is
called democracy as well.

20
00:05:52,985 --> 00:05:55,715
The journey of lndia's Republic..

21
00:05:55,788 --> 00:06:00,623
...began 37 years ago,
with 21 cannon salute..

22
00:06:00,727 --> 00:06:06,063
...and with Dr.
Rajendra Prasad hoisting..

23
00:06:06,165 --> 00:06:09,259
...the lndian flag on
26th January, 1950..

24
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:13,669
...and announced the historical
birth of the Republic of lndia.

25
00:06:14,006 --> 00:06:15,473
Four junior constables
and one lady constable..

26
00:06:15,575 --> 00:06:17,634
...along with you will be adequate.
- Yes.

27
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:18,836
Where are we conducting the raid?

28
00:06:18,911 --> 00:06:20,708
Even I don't know that yet.

29
00:06:20,813 --> 00:06:22,337
Only Mr. Sharma knows for now.

30
00:06:22,448 --> 00:06:25,246
Meet us at Safdurjung in 15 minutes.

31
00:06:28,187 --> 00:06:29,176
Ajay.

32
00:06:36,028 --> 00:06:37,427
Sir, we're getting late.

33
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,364
Sir, don't be tense.

34
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:44,164
Do you want me to lead?

35
00:06:47,673 --> 00:06:50,665
Are you nervous
because he's a minister..

36
00:06:53,713 --> 00:06:55,874
Ministers are not more
important than the country.

37
00:06:56,883 --> 00:06:57,907
Did you call the police?

38
00:06:57,984 --> 00:06:58,951
Yes, I did.

39
00:06:59,051 --> 00:07:00,518
They will be at
Safdurjung in 15 minutes.

40
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:02,281
Who is the Sl?
- Ranveer Singh.

41
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:11,628
Where is my staff?

42
00:07:12,398 --> 00:07:13,888
Sir.

43
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:41,481
Sir..

44
00:08:50,229 --> 00:08:51,753
Your shoelace is untied.

45
00:08:56,569 --> 00:08:57,968
The minister's home?

46
00:09:01,407 --> 00:09:02,635
Let's go.

47
00:09:56,362 --> 00:09:58,023
8% is not too much.

48
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:00,462
Your job's not too easy.

49
00:10:00,566 --> 00:10:03,126
The minister's said yes, otherwise..

50
00:10:04,503 --> 00:10:06,061
Sir, we're from the CBl.

51
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:07,896
We need to search your house.

52
00:10:08,007 --> 00:10:10,475
So what if you're the CBl,
you cannot barge in like this..

53
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:16,972
Sir. They're the CBl.

54
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,884
I think they're here
to raid your house.

55
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:20,850
Ajay.
- Sir.

56
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,182
Start.
- Yes, sir.

57
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:23,312
You look that way.
- Ranveer.

58
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:24,014
And you look that way.

59
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:25,090
Sir.

60
00:10:25,157 --> 00:10:27,182
If anyone tries to act smart,
don't hesitate to slap them.

61
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:28,225
Sir.

62
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:32,328
Come on, hurry up.

63
00:10:32,398 --> 00:10:34,730
Come on. Everyone, get inside.

64
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,960
Hurry up.

65
00:10:36,035 --> 00:10:37,263
Keep the phone down.
- L..

66
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:38,598
Keep it down. Come on.

67
00:10:38,671 --> 00:10:40,298
No one will come out.

68
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:55,448
Guddu's going to eat
this hot sweetmeat.

69
00:10:55,521 --> 00:10:56,613
Eat it.

70
00:10:56,722 --> 00:10:58,314
Bravo.

71
00:10:58,391 --> 00:10:59,688
One more.

72
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:01,590
Like this..

73
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:03,190
Who are you?

74
00:11:03,262 --> 00:11:04,729
You can't barge in here.

75
00:11:04,797 --> 00:11:06,822
The CBl has raided your house.

76
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:14,362
Sir.

77
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:21,143
Listen. Believe me,
there's nothing in here.

78
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:22,771
Handover the cupboard keys.

79
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:23,974
The key's lost, I don't have it.

80
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:25,983
Stop joking, handover the keys.

81
00:11:26,118 --> 00:11:27,983
Guddu's father, why
don't you say something?

82
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:29,527
Why is he asking for the keys?
- Sir.

83
00:11:29,588 --> 00:11:30,748
No point in calling him.

84
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:32,251
Handover the keys.
- What happened?

85
00:11:32,324 --> 00:11:33,552
Sir, she's not handing
over the cupboard keys.

86
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:34,785
I don't have it, so how can I..

87
00:11:34,894 --> 00:11:35,826
Break the lock.
- Yes.

88
00:11:35,928 --> 00:11:37,759
Move aside, let him do his job.

89
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:39,023
What are you doing?

90
00:11:39,131 --> 00:11:39,995
Stop.

91
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:41,761
He's broken the lock.

92
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:43,859
Oh God.

93
00:11:47,073 --> 00:11:49,701
Oh God.

94
00:11:51,243 --> 00:11:53,734
Sir. The minister's salary.

95
00:11:57,783 --> 00:12:01,014
Look... at that they
found from the cupboard.

96
00:12:01,087 --> 00:12:02,884
Guddu's father.

97
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:05,987
You never told me about these.

98
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:15,827
Shanti.

99
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:16,993
Sir.

100
00:12:17,636 --> 00:12:18,830
There's nothing here.

101
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:20,701
The Lord's resting here.

102
00:12:20,806 --> 00:12:22,501
Don't trouble Him.

103
00:12:22,608 --> 00:12:23,700
There's nothing.

104
00:12:23,809 --> 00:12:27,336
At least think about the Lord.
- Sir.

105
00:12:27,446 --> 00:12:28,926
What are you doing? You'll be cursed.

106
00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:30,779
Come on. The Lord's
omniscient One. He won't say a thing.

107
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:33,283
He'll curse you.
- Madam, please step aside.

108
00:12:33,352 --> 00:12:34,580
Sir.

109
00:12:34,987 --> 00:12:36,955
You're so mean.

110
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:40,619
Quiet.

111
00:12:54,507 --> 00:12:55,474
Sir. This too.

112
00:13:27,273 --> 00:13:28,797
Stop.
- Take all this out.

113
00:13:28,874 --> 00:13:30,102
Stop.
- Just a minute.

114
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:31,335
Leave me. Leave me.

115
00:13:31,443 --> 00:13:34,776
It's his hard earned money,
don't take it away.

116
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:37,372
Look, you're ruining my clothes.

117
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:39,178
Let go.
- Guddu's father. Stop them.

118
00:13:39,285 --> 00:13:41,116
Let go.
- Come on, let go of his sweater.

119
00:13:41,187 --> 00:13:43,519
You should be thankful that you
still have the jewellery you're wearing.

120
00:13:43,589 --> 00:13:45,523
You'll be cursed.

121
00:13:45,591 --> 00:13:48,287
We're ruined.

122
00:14:57,162 --> 00:14:58,390
Ajay.

123
00:15:54,353 --> 00:15:55,615
Sir, these are the documents.

124
00:15:55,721 --> 00:15:56,585
Look here, sir.

125
00:15:56,689 --> 00:15:58,452
These are land investments.

126
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:17,535
Sir.

127
00:16:24,883 --> 00:16:25,907
Sign here.
- Here.

128
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,384
I've one.

129
00:16:32,558 --> 00:16:36,187
Can we step aside for a minute, sir?

130
00:16:43,369 --> 00:16:46,634
Sir, my PA's really ill-mannered.

131
00:16:46,705 --> 00:16:48,639
He doesn't have the etiquettes..

132
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:52,438
...of how to talk to an
officer of your calibre.

133
00:16:53,245 --> 00:16:54,678
He's completely insane.

134
00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:58,077
I was saying, sir..
- What's your offer?

135
00:17:03,555 --> 00:17:04,988
How much do you want?

136
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:06,888
Two?

137
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,893
I think that will be fine.

138
00:17:09,461 --> 00:17:10,985
Two?
- Yes.

139
00:17:17,503 --> 00:17:18,765
P.K Sharma.

140
00:17:19,638 --> 00:17:21,196
Don't forget the name.

141
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:23,868
And tell your other corrupt friends..

142
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:27,174
...to pray that the CBl
don't raid their homes.

143
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,782
And if they do, then PK
Sharma isn't conducting it.

144
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:51,630
Sir.

145
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:56,071
Thankfully, you offered him only two.

146
00:17:58,610 --> 00:17:59,668
Joginder.
- Sir.

147
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:01,144
Lodge an FIR, make an inventory..

148
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:02,770
...and report back here.
- Yes.

149
00:18:02,881 --> 00:18:04,439
Take Ranveer Singh's
signature on the GM D..

150
00:18:04,516 --> 00:18:05,949
...you have only 30 minutes left.
- Yes, sir.

151
00:18:06,051 --> 00:18:07,382
Ranveer Singh.
- Sir.

152
00:18:07,486 --> 00:18:09,287
Inform your police
station over the wireless..

153
00:18:09,354 --> 00:18:11,720
...that Joginder's arriving
with all these valuables. - Sir.

154
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:12,950
You will wait here.

155
00:18:13,025 --> 00:18:14,720
Joginder will lodge an
FIR and come back to you..

156
00:18:14,793 --> 00:18:16,920
...and take your
signature on the GM D and.. - GM D?

157
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:18,388
What's wrong?

158
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:21,198
Sir, I..
- Sir?

159
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:23,396
What's GM D?

160
00:18:23,902 --> 00:18:25,369
Is this your first raid?

161
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:26,563
Yes, sir.

162
00:18:27,172 --> 00:18:28,298
How do you feel?

163
00:18:28,407 --> 00:18:30,932
Very good, sir. I've become your fan.

164
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:34,508
First time I'm seeing
the power of honesty.

165
00:18:34,813 --> 00:18:35,939
Such people should be..

166
00:18:36,048 --> 00:18:38,141
Always remember one
thing Ranveer Singh.

167
00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:41,411
True power comes from the heart.

168
00:18:41,854 --> 00:18:43,879
Always remember this in life.

169
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:44,854
Okay, sir.

170
00:18:45,324 --> 00:18:46,723
Sir, now we..
- Yes.

171
00:18:47,092 --> 00:18:49,253
Go and start the car. Okay.
- Yes.

172
00:18:49,361 --> 00:18:51,591
Sir.
- Good luck. Well done.

173
00:18:52,397 --> 00:18:54,297
Jai Hind.
- Jai Hind.

174
00:19:15,554 --> 00:19:17,112
You know what, sir.

175
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:19,079
Yes, Shanti.

176
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:21,492
They're doing the real duty.

177
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:24,392
We're just..

178
00:19:48,387 --> 00:19:49,877
True power comes from the heart.

179
00:19:49,955 --> 00:19:50,922
What else could I do?

180
00:19:50,989 --> 00:19:52,183
I didn't know what to do.

181
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:54,316
That minister was still tailing
me even after I slapped him twice.

182
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:55,553
I was so scared.

183
00:19:55,661 --> 00:19:57,185
The PA was fine, but then..

184
00:19:57,262 --> 00:19:58,422
And what was everyone up to?

185
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:00,691
Iqbal was taking my pictures,
without a reason.

186
00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:02,700
You wanted to lead.

187
00:20:02,801 --> 00:20:04,393
Go ahead and lead.

188
00:20:41,873 --> 00:20:43,465
Hurry up.

189
00:20:47,946 --> 00:20:49,573
Come on, come on.

190
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:55,718
Here you go.
- Yes, brother.

191
00:20:55,787 --> 00:20:58,153
Now leave.

192
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:37,353
Airport.

193
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:46,271
Old Delhi Station.
- Sit.

194
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:03,014
Hey mister, will I get a
bus to Jaipur from here?

195
00:22:03,088 --> 00:22:04,646
Yes.

196
00:22:21,073 --> 00:22:22,370
Here you go.

197
00:22:29,047 --> 00:22:30,947
One for Chandigarh.

198
00:23:40,051 --> 00:23:40,983
Say that again.

199
00:23:43,822 --> 00:23:45,153
Shanti, they...

200
00:23:45,223 --> 00:23:46,588
You know, sir.

201
00:23:46,658 --> 00:23:48,182
I knew something was wrong.

202
00:23:49,661 --> 00:23:51,424
Wait here.
- Yes.

203
00:24:00,305 --> 00:24:01,499
Mr. Minister.

204
00:24:06,411 --> 00:24:07,378
What's wrong?

205
00:24:07,479 --> 00:24:08,776
I've been ruined.

206
00:24:08,847 --> 00:24:10,439
Why do you look so sad?

207
00:24:12,884 --> 00:24:16,376
We made a small mistake.

208
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:51,285
Good morning, brother Joginder.
- Morning.

209
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:20,542
Anything in the papers?

210
00:25:20,619 --> 00:25:21,449
Nothing.

211
00:25:21,553 --> 00:25:24,454
Hindi, English, Punjabi,
nothing in either of them.

212
00:25:25,223 --> 00:25:26,349
Sell everything.

213
00:25:26,424 --> 00:25:27,391
We'll meet at the marriage.

214
00:25:27,459 --> 00:25:28,517
Of course.

215
00:25:35,567 --> 00:25:37,262
Raise that higher.

216
00:25:37,335 --> 00:25:39,235
Just a minute.

217
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:44,074
Anything in the news?
- No.

218
00:25:45,277 --> 00:25:46,801
How are the marriage preparations?

219
00:25:46,912 --> 00:25:48,243
I'm going crazy?

220
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,600
My own marriage
preparations were lot smoother...

221
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:52,580
then my daughter's.

222
00:25:52,817 --> 00:25:53,784
That's normal.

223
00:25:53,852 --> 00:25:56,013
The father's normally at his
tethers on his daughter's marriage.

224
00:25:56,087 --> 00:25:57,486
That's fine.

225
00:25:57,589 --> 00:25:58,578
When are you arriving?

226
00:25:58,657 --> 00:25:59,851
Friday.

227
00:26:00,191 --> 00:26:02,386
Come soon. I feel alone.

228
00:26:02,794 --> 00:26:04,056
Do you need anything?

229
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:05,996
No, just come here.

230
00:26:06,865 --> 00:26:09,163
Get me 7-8 cartons
of imported cigarette.

231
00:26:09,267 --> 00:26:11,030
For the wedding guests.

232
00:26:11,336 --> 00:26:12,530
And wait a minute.

233
00:26:12,637 --> 00:26:13,797
What's written here?

234
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:16,507
A nice watch for the groom.

235
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:17,473
And?

236
00:26:17,542 --> 00:26:19,874
And a Philips VCR.

237
00:26:19,945 --> 00:26:22,004
And... what's a Chuser-grinder?

238
00:26:22,113 --> 00:26:23,705
I don't get it.

239
00:26:23,782 --> 00:26:27,582
A nice black pair of
Bata shoes, without laces.

240
00:26:27,652 --> 00:26:29,142
Don't forget.

241
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:31,484
Perfumes and scents.

242
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:34,081
And you get anything
else that you like.

243
00:26:34,726 --> 00:26:37,194
How about a car?
- No, I've booked one here.

244
00:26:37,495 --> 00:26:39,190
Inform me about your flight.

245
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:40,731
I'll send someone to pick you up.

246
00:26:40,832 --> 00:26:42,493
You'll be carrying a lot of luggage.

247
00:26:43,034 --> 00:26:44,160
Fine.

248
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:45,994
See you.

249
00:26:46,471 --> 00:26:47,460
Come soon.

250
00:26:48,873 --> 00:26:49,771
Where are you going?

251
00:26:49,841 --> 00:26:51,866
Who will finish the work downstairs,
lazy bums?

252
00:26:57,816 --> 00:26:59,511
Hello.
- It's your uncle.

253
00:26:59,584 --> 00:27:00,346
How are you, Rahul?

254
00:27:00,418 --> 00:27:02,181
I'm good. How are you?

255
00:27:02,253 --> 00:27:03,652
I am fine. Where's your papa?

256
00:27:03,755 --> 00:27:05,746
He's washing the clothes.
I'll call him.

257
00:27:09,661 --> 00:27:11,959
Papa. Uncle Ajay's called.

258
00:27:12,497 --> 00:27:13,327
What did you say?

259
00:27:13,431 --> 00:27:15,032
I said you're
washing clothes, what else?

260
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:24,297
Hello.

261
00:27:24,509 --> 00:27:26,807
Anything in the papers?
- No.

262
00:27:26,911 --> 00:27:28,071
Why were you washing clothes?

263
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:29,340
Clothes? No.

264
00:27:29,414 --> 00:27:31,245
My handkerchief was too dirty.

265
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:32,840
Malti's gone to see the doctor.

266
00:27:32,951 --> 00:27:34,145
Look at that!

267
00:27:34,219 --> 00:27:35,618
Wasting time on the phone.

268
00:27:35,687 --> 00:27:37,416
I asked you to make tea.

269
00:27:38,089 --> 00:27:39,716
And, did you finish
washing the clothes?

270
00:27:40,792 --> 00:27:42,113
It's a call from the head-office.

271
00:27:42,193 --> 00:27:44,388
Ask them to give you an increment.

272
00:27:44,462 --> 00:27:46,054
You can't even afford a servant now.

273
00:27:46,131 --> 00:27:48,531
I've to do all the chores at home.

274
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:52,667
We'll meet at the marriage.

275
00:27:53,071 --> 00:27:54,538
Hello. Hello.
- Yes.

276
00:27:54,606 --> 00:27:57,905
Ajay. Don't tell them about this.

277
00:27:57,976 --> 00:27:59,034
Why?

278
00:27:59,477 --> 00:28:00,910
They'll tease me to death.

279
00:28:00,979 --> 00:28:02,207
I won't.

280
00:28:02,814 --> 00:28:03,940
See you.

281
00:28:24,636 --> 00:28:27,196
Who are you?

282
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:31,498
How are we related?

283
00:28:32,977 --> 00:28:39,746
What's this bond that binds us?

284
00:28:41,252 --> 00:28:49,125
I can't control myself before you.

285
00:28:49,594 --> 00:28:52,062
Who are you?

286
00:28:52,464 --> 00:28:56,992
How are we related?

287
00:29:24,129 --> 00:29:26,359
Stupid girl. Can't you see?

288
00:29:30,535 --> 00:29:32,400
Grandma, I'm leaving.

289
00:29:33,238 --> 00:29:35,039
Say See you. You're
not running away, are you?

290
00:29:35,073 --> 00:29:42,707
Don't ever leave me and go away.

291
00:29:42,814 --> 00:29:47,114
For my sake.

292
00:29:47,352 --> 00:29:55,088
Always stay with,
whether it's true of false.

293
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:59,286
Or just an illusion.

294
00:29:59,397 --> 00:30:07,397
I've tried my best to make you mine.

295
00:30:07,906 --> 00:30:15,906
Hold my hands so I
can let everyone know.

296
00:30:16,581 --> 00:30:19,448
Who are you?

297
00:30:19,551 --> 00:30:23,647
How are we related?

298
00:30:29,627 --> 00:30:30,719
What is it?

299
00:30:32,463 --> 00:30:33,930
Wedding invitation.

300
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:36,193
She's getting married.

301
00:30:36,301 --> 00:30:37,393
To whom?

302
00:30:37,602 --> 00:30:38,762
Tukaram.

303
00:30:39,304 --> 00:30:40,737
Now?

304
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:43,672
What now? The groom will be ruined.

305
00:30:44,943 --> 00:30:46,672
Come on, clean the scooter.

306
00:30:46,744 --> 00:30:48,143
Come on, go.

307
00:30:52,817 --> 00:30:53,579
Sir, please.

308
00:30:53,651 --> 00:30:54,982
If you give me some more time...

309
00:30:55,053 --> 00:30:57,248
I will find out who they were.

310
00:30:57,822 --> 00:31:00,052
You don't want to file a complaint?
- No.

311
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:01,685
What about the investigation?

312
00:31:01,793 --> 00:31:03,818
Look, ACP. I've
already lost everything.

313
00:31:03,895 --> 00:31:05,362
Now this news shouldn't be
leaked out to the press.

314
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:06,292
That's it.

315
00:31:06,397 --> 00:31:08,957
If you can still do anything,
then go ahead.

316
00:31:09,067 --> 00:31:11,001
We cannot do anything without an FIR.

317
00:31:11,336 --> 00:31:13,702
You can suspend these officers.

318
00:31:13,771 --> 00:31:17,263
These two were helping
those thieves the other day.

319
00:31:17,775 --> 00:31:20,107
Sir, let's stop
arguing over those thieves.

320
00:31:20,478 --> 00:31:23,777
Let me tell you, we cannot
do anything without an FIR.

321
00:31:27,352 --> 00:31:29,650
Why don't you understand?

322
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:32,189
I've a public image.

323
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:35,851
If they find out four
people made a fool out of me...

324
00:31:36,294 --> 00:31:38,854
it will be the end
of my political career.

325
00:31:39,764 --> 00:31:42,289
No. Let it go.

326
00:31:47,805 --> 00:31:49,602
Ranvir Singh.
- Sir.

327
00:31:51,276 --> 00:31:52,368
Shame on you.

328
00:31:52,844 --> 00:31:54,607
Will we help thieves and robbers now?

329
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:56,178
You're absolutely right, sir.

330
00:31:56,281 --> 00:31:59,341
The Minister isn't
filing a report, otherwise...

331
00:32:01,619 --> 00:32:03,746
But, there will be a
departmental inquiry.

332
00:32:05,023 --> 00:32:06,888
And, until the inquiry isn't over...

333
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:10,493
you and Shanti are suspended.

334
00:32:11,329 --> 00:32:13,024
Got it.
- Sir.

335
00:32:17,735 --> 00:32:19,362
See you, sir.

336
00:32:21,572 --> 00:32:23,267
That was the right thing to do, sir.

337
00:32:23,374 --> 00:32:25,239
Suspending those two.

338
00:32:25,343 --> 00:32:26,810
Here, sir.

339
00:33:21,265 --> 00:33:22,698
Welcome, welcome.

340
00:33:23,034 --> 00:33:26,561
Lift this up.

341
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:28,434
Come, brother.

342
00:33:31,376 --> 00:33:32,468
Brother, you're still here.

343
00:33:32,543 --> 00:33:33,976
Let's go. Come on.

344
00:33:34,245 --> 00:33:35,337
That way.

345
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:41,008
Come on.

346
00:33:41,619 --> 00:33:43,450
Hail the Lord!

347
00:33:44,455 --> 00:33:46,082
Move aside.

348
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:47,623
Let me sit.

349
00:33:48,493 --> 00:33:50,290
Come on.

350
00:34:07,178 --> 00:34:08,839
You're here.

351
00:34:08,913 --> 00:34:10,380
How are you, Sharma?

352
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:12,413
Bless you.

353
00:34:12,517 --> 00:34:13,609
Congratulations.

354
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:14,343
Did you get the things?

355
00:34:14,419 --> 00:34:15,010
Hello, son.

356
00:34:15,086 --> 00:34:16,075
Get the things.

357
00:34:16,187 --> 00:34:17,381
Yes, the luggage's right there.
Take all of them.

358
00:34:17,455 --> 00:34:18,046
Come.

359
00:34:18,156 --> 00:34:19,680
Are the others here?
- Yes, they are.

360
00:34:19,791 --> 00:34:21,258
They arrived in the morning.
- Where are they?

361
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:22,121
They're inside.

362
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:23,784
They must be eating.

363
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:26,420
Let them eat.
- This is the time for them to eat.

364
00:34:26,531 --> 00:34:28,362
Don't taunt them.

365
00:34:28,433 --> 00:34:31,129
He's here.

366
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:34,261
Go ahead, eat.
- Congratulations.

367
00:34:35,173 --> 00:34:36,265
Come on.

368
00:34:36,374 --> 00:34:38,069
You didn't eat anything.

369
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:40,203
You're looking really smart.
- Where are the others?

370
00:34:40,278 --> 00:34:42,041
I'll introduce you to my kids.

371
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,275
This is Sukhwinder.
- Hello.

372
00:34:44,348 --> 00:34:45,246
This is Parminder.
- Hello.

373
00:34:45,349 --> 00:34:46,349
This is Maninder.
- Hello.

374
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:47,247
This is Jitender.
- Hello.

375
00:34:47,351 --> 00:34:48,648
This is Harminder.
- Hello.

376
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:49,777
This is Dharmender.
- Hello.

377
00:34:49,854 --> 00:34:51,082
She's getting married, Tinky.
- Hello.

378
00:34:51,189 --> 00:34:52,781
And she's Mrs. Sharma.
- Hello.

379
00:34:52,857 --> 00:34:54,882
And this is Ajay, lqbal, Joginder.

380
00:34:54,992 --> 00:34:56,118
And she's newly born.

381
00:34:56,227 --> 00:34:57,626
We haven't given her a name yet.

382
00:34:57,695 --> 00:34:58,627
That's it.

383
00:35:00,064 --> 00:35:02,157
We didn't have television.

384
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:03,233
Surprising.

385
00:35:03,301 --> 00:35:04,825
Take a picture.

386
00:35:10,875 --> 00:35:13,901
Hurry up, or else...

387
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:18,872
The moon will rise up.

388
00:35:20,885 --> 00:35:23,877
The tent will be...

389
00:35:25,923 --> 00:35:28,892
Filled with fog.

390
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:36,232
I want to bathe in your colour.

391
00:36:00,057 --> 00:36:02,548
You are so beautiful.

392
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,924
You look priceless.

393
00:36:05,129 --> 00:36:07,495
Every time I look at you.

394
00:36:07,598 --> 00:36:10,032
My heart skips a beat.

395
00:36:10,434 --> 00:36:11,696
Your face...

396
00:36:11,769 --> 00:36:12,963
Your face...

397
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:15,561
Your face covered with tresses.

398
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:18,471
It's so awesome, girl.

399
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:28,018
Your face covered with tresses.

400
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:30,952
It's so awesome, girl.

401
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:45,433
My friends say.

402
00:36:47,605 --> 00:36:50,540
Boys are such a flirt.

403
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:55,144
My friends say.

404
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:57,545
Boys are such a flirt.

405
00:36:57,615 --> 00:37:00,209
They always sweet-talk girls.

406
00:37:00,318 --> 00:37:02,377
Beloved.

407
00:37:02,453 --> 00:37:05,149
If you're one of them.

408
00:37:05,256 --> 00:37:07,724
If you break my heart.

409
00:37:07,825 --> 00:37:10,293
Then what about me?

410
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:12,862
Beloved.

411
00:37:13,431 --> 00:37:15,695
I'm no betrayer,
test me all you want.

412
00:37:15,766 --> 00:37:17,996
Just spend a night with me.

413
00:37:18,369 --> 00:37:20,462
I will never leave you, I swear.

414
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:22,596
I will love you all my life.

415
00:37:22,673 --> 00:37:24,834
I am the shadow, you
are the sun, beloved.

416
00:37:25,176 --> 00:37:27,235
You are priceless, beloved.

417
00:37:27,612 --> 00:37:29,978
Every time I look at you.

418
00:37:30,047 --> 00:37:32,515
My heart skips a beat.

419
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:34,212
Your face...

420
00:37:34,318 --> 00:37:35,478
Your face...

421
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:38,077
Your face covered with tresses.

422
00:37:38,155 --> 00:37:41,022
It's so awesome, girl.

423
00:37:50,134 --> 00:37:53,103
The game of love.

424
00:37:55,139 --> 00:37:58,108
Is a deceitful one.

425
00:38:00,144 --> 00:38:02,544
The game of love.

426
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:05,104
Is a deceitful one.

427
00:38:05,182 --> 00:38:07,776
Your freedoms always at stake.

428
00:38:07,852 --> 00:38:10,013
Beloved.

429
00:38:10,087 --> 00:38:12,555
Once you fall in love.

430
00:38:12,657 --> 00:38:15,091
You can't get out of it.

431
00:38:15,159 --> 00:38:17,821
I don't want fall in love ever.

432
00:38:17,895 --> 00:38:20,728
Beloved.

433
00:38:20,831 --> 00:38:23,299
Love me, trust me just once.

434
00:38:23,401 --> 00:38:25,494
I will always be with you.

435
00:38:25,903 --> 00:38:27,029
If you give me your heart...

436
00:38:27,104 --> 00:38:30,005
I will give you everything,
that's my promise.

437
00:38:30,107 --> 00:38:32,337
We're made for each other.

438
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:34,873
You are precious, beloved.

439
00:38:35,046 --> 00:38:37,446
Every time I look at you.

440
00:38:37,548 --> 00:38:40,016
My heart skips a beat.

441
00:38:40,584 --> 00:38:41,676
Your face...

442
00:38:41,786 --> 00:38:42,980
Your face...

443
00:38:43,054 --> 00:38:45,579
Your face covered with tresses.

444
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:48,921
It's so awesome, girl.

445
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:19,914
You did the right thing
by attending the marriage.

446
00:39:20,091 --> 00:39:21,353
We had such fun.

447
00:39:21,492 --> 00:39:22,959
How can I not come if you call?

448
00:39:24,829 --> 00:39:25,955
Jai Hind, sir.

449
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:27,790
Jai Hind.

450
00:39:27,932 --> 00:39:29,024
Anything else, Mr. Khurana?

451
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:30,860
You can leave, I'll
talk to you later. - Yes.

452
00:39:32,136 --> 00:39:33,228
Mr. Khurana?

453
00:39:33,337 --> 00:39:35,362
Yes. They think I'm the lG of police.

454
00:39:37,274 --> 00:39:39,936
Think big. The children have grown up.

455
00:39:40,578 --> 00:39:42,307
It's not like before.
It's getting scarier.

456
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:44,379
Last night I had a dream, that...

457
00:39:44,448 --> 00:39:46,279
my son-in-law's
come to see me in jail.

458
00:39:46,484 --> 00:39:47,951
And you were nowhere to be seen.

459
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:49,144
You didn't look properly.

460
00:39:49,253 --> 00:39:50,948
I must be standing right behind you.

461
00:39:52,423 --> 00:39:53,583
Where's the next one?

462
00:39:54,258 --> 00:39:55,452
Kolkata.

463
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,186
Where in Kolkata?

464
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:58,453
Bada Bazaar.

465
00:39:58,729 --> 00:39:59,821
Is it good?

466
00:40:00,931 --> 00:40:02,023
When?

467
00:40:02,333 --> 00:40:03,425
A week later.

468
00:40:03,501 --> 00:40:05,162
Big or small.
- Small.

469
00:40:06,537 --> 00:40:07,765
Think something big.

470
00:40:07,838 --> 00:40:08,964
We'll need more
people do something big...

471
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:10,700
and that means more money.

472
00:40:10,808 --> 00:40:13,174
Had I been doing a job,
then I would've retired at this age.

473
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:15,210
You've been saying
that for the last 5 years.

474
00:40:15,312 --> 00:40:16,643
No, I'm serious now.

475
00:40:16,714 --> 00:40:18,474
You've been saying
that for the past 3 years.

476
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:21,176
Here you go.

477
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:22,780
The tickets and money are in this.

478
00:40:22,787 --> 00:40:24,721
You Joginder and lqbal
will meet me directly.

479
00:40:24,789 --> 00:40:26,086
Okay?
- Okay.

480
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:27,248
See you.

481
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:29,256
Take care.
- Yes.

482
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:48,103
Run, run, run, run, run.

483
00:41:05,196 --> 00:41:06,891
Stop, stop, stop.

484
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:08,329
Stop.

485
00:41:08,666 --> 00:41:10,395
Sorry.
- Come on.

486
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:12,629
Hi, Aman.
- Hi.

487
00:41:12,903 --> 00:41:14,165
Come on.

488
00:41:14,271 --> 00:41:15,499
Let's go.
- Bye.

489
00:41:15,606 --> 00:41:16,937
Bye, dad.
- Bye.

490
00:41:17,041 --> 00:41:19,441
Father. Call me father.
- Bye, father.

491
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:31,600
We were about to miss the bus.
- Rahul's called.

492
00:41:37,461 --> 00:41:38,723
Where's your veil?

493
00:41:42,066 --> 00:41:43,226
Yes, Rahul.

494
00:41:44,268 --> 00:41:45,394
Where?

495
00:41:46,437 --> 00:41:47,563
I'll be right there.

496
00:41:49,373 --> 00:41:51,253
Something urgent has
come up. I'll be back soon.

497
00:41:51,542 --> 00:41:52,770
Will you go like this?

498
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:54,842
Yes, it's okay.

499
00:42:53,971 --> 00:42:55,131
Morning, sir.

500
00:42:55,606 --> 00:42:57,767
Are you sure it's him?
- Yes, sir. He'll be here soon.

501
00:42:57,875 --> 00:42:59,604
Who will identify him?
- Munna, sir.

502
00:43:06,817 --> 00:43:10,548
Don't beat me. Don't beat me, sir.
- No. Let me go.

503
00:43:10,621 --> 00:43:13,249
I've children.
- Shut up or we'll beat you more.

504
00:43:13,357 --> 00:43:15,222
Leave me. Let me go.

505
00:43:18,028 --> 00:43:19,256
Why did you beat him so much?

506
00:43:19,396 --> 00:43:21,887
They were gentle compared
to you, Waseem sir. - Move.

507
00:43:24,702 --> 00:43:25,964
Sir. Gupta.

508
00:43:34,178 --> 00:43:35,702
Is that him?
- Yes.

509
00:43:35,879 --> 00:43:37,813
Rascal. Come here. Identify him.

510
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:41,511
Yes, that's him.

511
00:43:42,486 --> 00:43:43,646
Go.
- Sir. - Come on.

512
00:44:01,005 --> 00:44:02,996
Hey. Hey, Gupta. Stop.

513
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:04,266
Come here.

514
00:44:06,877 --> 00:44:08,435
Stop.

515
00:44:08,512 --> 00:44:09,979
Where are you going? Stop the car.

516
00:44:12,616 --> 00:44:13,742
Stop.

517
00:44:19,957 --> 00:44:21,083
Stop.

518
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:35,930
Stop.

519
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:17,740
Stop.

520
00:45:25,856 --> 00:45:26,982
Hey, move.

521
00:45:30,194 --> 00:45:31,320
You..

522
00:45:34,331 --> 00:45:35,491
Stop. Stop.

523
00:45:42,372 --> 00:45:43,498
Stop.

524
00:45:47,211 --> 00:45:48,508
Hey, what is it?

525
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:50,604
CBl. Follow that rickshaw.

526
00:45:57,621 --> 00:45:58,747
Closer.

527
00:45:59,723 --> 00:46:01,588
Run. You..

528
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:07,825
Do you want to die?

529
00:46:52,943 --> 00:46:54,501
Don't come any closer.

530
00:46:59,149 --> 00:47:00,377
I will jump down.

531
00:47:02,786 --> 00:47:04,014
Don't come any closer.

532
00:47:04,087 --> 00:47:05,486
Stay there. I will jump down.

533
00:47:07,724 --> 00:47:08,850
Stay there.

534
00:47:11,028 --> 00:47:12,325
I say stop.

535
00:47:27,811 --> 00:47:30,075
Sir. He's doing the real job.

536
00:47:31,148 --> 00:47:32,877
We're just.

537
00:47:35,819 --> 00:47:37,252
Step aside. Move.

538
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:38,548
Come, sir.

539
00:47:52,002 --> 00:47:53,697
Good morning, teacher.
- Morning.

540
00:48:00,978 --> 00:48:02,138
How are you?

541
00:48:02,679 --> 00:48:03,737
Don't you dare talk to me.

542
00:48:03,847 --> 00:48:05,041
Where were you?

543
00:48:05,582 --> 00:48:06,810
Chandigarh.

544
00:48:07,651 --> 00:48:09,278
My friend's daughter
was getting married.

545
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:12,945
I tried to meet you the
other day, but the old man...

546
00:48:13,056 --> 00:48:14,717
Father.
- Yes, him.

547
00:48:15,692 --> 00:48:17,717
I tried calling you all evening...

548
00:48:17,794 --> 00:48:19,314
but he answered
the call every time.

549
00:48:19,329 --> 00:48:20,557
Did you see the card?

550
00:48:21,465 --> 00:48:22,659
How was it?

551
00:48:24,701 --> 00:48:27,169
Why are you wasting your
father's provident fund?

552
00:48:27,804 --> 00:48:29,328
Grandma really likes the boy.

553
00:48:30,407 --> 00:48:31,806
You look happy.

554
00:48:32,876 --> 00:48:35,037
Do you like that Tukaram as well?

555
00:48:35,846 --> 00:48:37,507
I'm happy because I know...

556
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:39,674
you won't let me
marry that Tukaram.

557
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:41,730
By the way, what are you waiting for?

558
00:48:42,252 --> 00:48:43,685
For a big tender.

559
00:48:44,454 --> 00:48:46,319
You call your scams and thefts tender.

560
00:48:46,957 --> 00:48:48,424
I still have some shame left in me.

561
00:48:48,926 --> 00:48:50,621
Then why do such
things in the first place?

562
00:48:51,261 --> 00:48:52,741
Because that's the only thing I know.

563
00:48:53,964 --> 00:48:55,226
People are restless..

564
00:48:55,299 --> 00:48:56,698
...and my mind is restless.

565
00:48:57,768 --> 00:49:00,896
Whenever I look at you...

566
00:49:02,172 --> 00:49:03,935
I feel like being good.

567
00:49:10,747 --> 00:49:12,387
Is that why you keep
running away from me?

568
00:49:14,151 --> 00:49:17,245
I try, but I can't.

569
00:49:19,923 --> 00:49:21,413
The marriage is next week, Ajay.

570
00:49:22,359 --> 00:49:23,553
I know.

571
00:49:24,761 --> 00:49:26,092
What if you're caught?

572
00:49:30,934 --> 00:49:33,528
There's no one in this
world who can catch me.

573
00:49:38,308 --> 00:49:39,741
Jai Hind, sir.
- Jai Hind.

574
00:49:41,678 --> 00:49:43,509
And look, sir.
- Good morning, sir.

575
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:44,974
A similar case took place in Kanpur.

576
00:49:45,048 --> 00:49:46,606
A year ago.
- I see. This one.

577
00:49:47,718 --> 00:49:49,242
Good morning, sir.

578
00:49:53,557 --> 00:49:54,615
Sir.

579
00:49:54,725 --> 00:49:55,919
Jai Hind.
- Jai Hind.

580
00:49:56,259 --> 00:49:58,139
Did you hear about the
26th January case? - Yes.

581
00:49:58,195 --> 00:50:00,390
Four people conducted a raid
posing as officers of our department.

582
00:50:00,697 --> 00:50:02,892
The minister isn't filing
a case for obvious reasons.

583
00:50:02,966 --> 00:50:05,332
For reasons best known to him.
- Yes.

584
00:50:05,435 --> 00:50:06,835
The minister isn't filing a case...

585
00:50:06,870 --> 00:50:08,394
for reasons best known to him.

586
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:10,371
It's a simple police case, sir.

587
00:50:10,474 --> 00:50:12,704
You do know that they...
- But still, sir.

588
00:50:12,909 --> 00:50:14,604
Why indulge in such petty...

589
00:50:14,945 --> 00:50:16,173
Do you see that man?

590
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:18,980
He's the Sl who helped
them conduct the rain.

591
00:50:19,082 --> 00:50:20,447
Poor guy, he was humiliated.

592
00:50:21,385 --> 00:50:23,216
He conducted an investigation...

593
00:50:24,121 --> 00:50:25,918
and gathered this information.

594
00:50:26,890 --> 00:50:29,154
There have been 13 such
cases in the last 2 years.

595
00:50:29,626 --> 00:50:30,957
These are the ones that were detected.

596
00:50:31,061 --> 00:50:32,756
No one knows the real number of cases.

597
00:50:33,497 --> 00:50:36,728
Fake CBl, income Tax or
ACB teams conduct a raid...

598
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:39,132
and the victims never report.

599
00:50:39,503 --> 00:50:40,970
Rumours are spreading.

600
00:50:42,005 --> 00:50:45,099
There's a theory that they're ex-CBl.

601
00:50:45,542 --> 00:50:46,702
Strange.

602
00:50:47,677 --> 00:50:49,645
Anyway, we've to stop this nonsense.

603
00:50:50,547 --> 00:50:51,912
They're slandering our name.

604
00:50:52,115 --> 00:50:56,916
Madras(Chennai),
Nagpur, Trivandrum. Lucknow.

605
00:50:57,020 --> 00:50:58,351
Sir, it's all over the country.

606
00:50:58,422 --> 00:51:01,550
They mostly target
businessmen and politicians.

607
00:51:01,658 --> 00:51:03,057
Because there's
black money involved...

608
00:51:03,126 --> 00:51:04,718
no one wants to report it.

609
00:51:05,162 --> 00:51:07,153
Which party do these
politicians belong to, sir?

610
00:51:07,330 --> 00:51:09,389
They're from every party we know.

611
00:51:09,933 --> 00:51:12,197
I expect you to end
this nuisance immediately.

612
00:51:12,569 --> 00:51:13,695
Yes, sir.

613
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:16,600
Sir, I haven't received a
promotion and increment yet.

614
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:17,968
It's getting difficult
to run the household.

615
00:51:18,041 --> 00:51:20,202
Shall I start accepting bribes?
- Threatening me again.

616
00:51:20,577 --> 00:51:21,703
I'm discussing this matter.

617
00:51:21,812 --> 00:51:23,012
Consider it done from my side.

618
00:51:24,381 --> 00:51:25,780
Jai Hind, sir.
- Jai Hind.

619
00:51:29,186 --> 00:51:30,787
And in that case all
the four officers...

620
00:51:30,854 --> 00:51:33,550
they posed as income tax officers.
- Here, take this.

621
00:51:33,623 --> 00:51:35,215
Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

622
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:38,020
He's Waseem sir.

623
00:51:38,128 --> 00:51:39,561
He will be handling the case.

624
00:51:40,063 --> 00:51:41,724
Sl Ranveer Singh. Jai Hind.

625
00:51:42,699 --> 00:51:44,792
Why is he standing? Let him sit.
- Sit.

626
00:51:44,901 --> 00:51:45,959
No, I'm fine.
- No, sit.

627
00:51:46,036 --> 00:51:47,765
No, I..
- Please. Please.

628
00:51:47,838 --> 00:51:48,998
Sit.
- Sit.

629
00:51:49,106 --> 00:51:50,232
Sit.

630
00:52:04,521 --> 00:52:06,716
They made a fool of you, Mr. Ranveer.

631
00:52:09,426 --> 00:52:10,552
Yes.

632
00:52:11,995 --> 00:52:13,792
Will you tell me
what exactly happened?

633
00:52:16,833 --> 00:52:18,266
It was the 26th of January.

634
00:52:18,902 --> 00:52:20,062
I was on duty.

635
00:52:20,704 --> 00:52:21,830
I received a call.

636
00:52:28,645 --> 00:52:30,125
'Tughlak Road police station, hello.'

637
00:52:30,380 --> 00:52:31,506
'Jai Hind.'

638
00:52:32,182 --> 00:52:33,877
'Jai Hind.
- Who's this?'

639
00:52:34,718 --> 00:52:35,810
'Sl Ranveer Singh.'

640
00:52:35,886 --> 00:52:37,615
'This is Ajay Singh from CBl ward 16.'

641
00:52:37,721 --> 00:52:39,689
'From additional
director PK Sharma's office.'

642
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:42,291
'Who is the officer on duty?
- That's me, sir.

643
00:52:42,492 --> 00:52:44,460
We need some men, to conduct a raid.'

644
00:52:44,895 --> 00:52:46,055
'How many, sir?'

645
00:52:46,429 --> 00:52:48,795
'Four junior constables, and one
lady constable along with you.'

646
00:52:48,899 --> 00:52:51,333
'That will be enough.
- Where's the raid?'

647
00:52:51,535 --> 00:52:53,435
'Even we don't know that.'

648
00:52:53,503 --> 00:52:54,765
'Only Mr. Sharma knows.'

649
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:56,358
'Meet us at Safdurjung in 15 minutes.'

650
00:52:56,373 --> 00:52:57,806
'Jai Hind.
- Jai Hind.'

651
00:53:00,610 --> 00:53:02,475
Four of them.
- Yes, sir.

652
00:53:03,413 --> 00:53:04,573
Then?

653
00:53:05,415 --> 00:53:06,575
Then...

654
00:53:12,389 --> 00:53:14,220
'You just can't barge in here...'

655
00:53:15,525 --> 00:53:16,787
'Keep the phone down.'

656
00:53:26,203 --> 00:53:27,636
'Believe me, there's nothing in here.'

657
00:53:27,704 --> 00:53:28,932
'Madam, please step aside.'

658
00:53:29,005 --> 00:53:30,996
'Guddu's papa, stop them.
- Let go of him.'

659
00:53:39,883 --> 00:53:44,183
Ranveer Singh, did
someone tell you or did you...

660
00:53:45,455 --> 00:53:46,683
If you had been in my place then...

661
00:53:46,756 --> 00:53:49,782
If I had been in your place this
situation would've never come up.

662
00:53:50,827 --> 00:53:53,489
I didn't join the CBl to screw up!

663
00:53:58,134 --> 00:54:00,432
I admit my mistake, Waseem sir.

664
00:54:01,504 --> 00:54:03,165
I don't have to listen to your taunts.

665
00:54:03,873 --> 00:54:05,773
I came here because
I needed your help.

666
00:54:06,176 --> 00:54:08,440
If you help me we can
solve this case quickly.

667
00:54:09,145 --> 00:54:11,613
Otherwise, don't be mistaken
that I've admitted defeat.

668
00:54:12,349 --> 00:54:14,180
It will take me longer alone...

669
00:54:15,218 --> 00:54:18,449
but, I won't rest until
I don't put an end to this.

670
00:54:25,729 --> 00:54:27,060
That's what I wanted to hear.

671
00:54:28,431 --> 00:54:30,160
Co-ordinate with all the
police stations. - Yes, sir.

672
00:54:30,267 --> 00:54:32,064
And Ranveer, you will check all
the police records yourself...

673
00:54:32,135 --> 00:54:35,036
because you're the only
one who have seen them. - Sir.

674
00:54:35,305 --> 00:54:37,637
Let's hope we find
their police records.

675
00:54:37,907 --> 00:54:39,340
When can we meet the minister?

676
00:54:42,746 --> 00:54:44,213
Yes. What is it?

677
00:54:44,648 --> 00:54:45,740
Sir, this is Waseem Khan.

678
00:54:45,849 --> 00:54:46,941
From CBl.

679
00:54:47,150 --> 00:54:48,242
Again?

680
00:54:48,752 --> 00:54:49,878
He's the real one.

681
00:54:51,354 --> 00:54:52,480
Hello.

682
00:55:27,123 --> 00:55:28,249
Taxi.

683
00:55:28,892 --> 00:55:30,052
Bada Bazaar.

684
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:51,472
Joginder.
- Sir.

685
00:57:30,713 --> 00:57:31,839
Ajay.

686
00:57:39,422 --> 00:57:41,083
Don't waste my time.

687
00:57:41,391 --> 00:57:42,722
Otherwise I'll note this down.

688
00:57:42,792 --> 00:57:44,191
Note this down.
- Yes, sir.

689
00:58:08,518 --> 00:58:10,008
You?
- CBl. And you?

690
00:58:10,086 --> 00:58:12,486
What...
- Income Tax Department.

691
00:58:12,922 --> 00:58:14,514
Mr. Sharma, give me the papers.

692
00:58:14,891 --> 00:58:16,950
Mr. Sharma, the order papers. Quick.

693
00:58:20,964 --> 00:58:22,989
Aggarwal Traders?
- Poddar Traders.

694
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:29,695
124?
- 214!

695
00:58:31,674 --> 00:58:32,766
What's this?

696
00:58:32,976 --> 00:58:34,238
Why do you mess up?

697
00:58:34,444 --> 00:58:36,344
Can't you see the numbers properly?

698
00:58:36,412 --> 00:58:38,380
You'll make me lose my job.

699
00:58:38,681 --> 00:58:39,909
You've grown old.

700
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:41,476
We were supposed to go to 124...

701
00:58:41,551 --> 00:58:42,643
instead you brought us to 214.

702
00:58:42,752 --> 00:58:44,276
See?
- Sorry, sir.

703
00:58:44,821 --> 00:58:45,947
Sorry!

704
00:58:46,322 --> 00:58:48,483
It's time for you to retire.
- Yes.

705
00:58:49,425 --> 00:58:53,361
It happens sometimes.
Things mess up. It's ok.

706
00:58:53,463 --> 00:58:55,192
Sorry, it was a slight blunder.

707
00:58:55,632 --> 00:58:56,860
You can continue.

708
00:58:57,100 --> 00:58:58,863
You can get on with your job,
and we'll get back to ours.

709
00:58:59,302 --> 00:59:00,564
Let's go.
- Yes.

710
00:59:14,584 --> 00:59:15,744
Aggarwal Traders.

711
00:59:15,852 --> 00:59:17,683
We're from the income Tax.

712
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:21,857
No calls allowed. None.

713
00:59:21,925 --> 00:59:23,051
Sir...
- Quiet.

714
00:59:23,126 --> 00:59:24,354
Sir, there's nothing.
- Where's the key?

715
00:59:24,427 --> 00:59:25,553
Where's the key?
- Sir... - Get it.

716
00:59:25,628 --> 00:59:27,061
Sir, the accounts...

717
00:59:38,775 --> 00:59:39,935
Sir, what have you done?

718
00:59:40,276 --> 00:59:42,369
I told you won't find anything.
- Shut up.

719
00:59:44,581 --> 00:59:46,879
Come on.
- Sir, sir...

720
00:59:54,324 --> 00:59:56,485
You're tearing the mattress.

721
01:00:15,645 --> 01:00:17,545
Where's the rest of the cash?
- Sir...

722
01:00:17,614 --> 01:00:19,172
Where is it?
- Sir, please.

723
01:00:19,248 --> 01:00:21,182
Where's the money?
- Iqbal.

724
01:00:21,250 --> 01:00:22,410
Where's the cash...

725
01:00:25,722 --> 01:00:27,747
Move this mattress. Hurry up.

726
01:00:27,857 --> 01:00:29,757
Move back. Hold me.

727
01:00:44,173 --> 01:00:45,970
What's going on?

728
01:00:46,042 --> 01:00:48,567
Clear them out. Clear all them out.

729
01:00:48,678 --> 01:00:50,043
What's going on here?

730
01:02:00,216 --> 01:02:01,478
Sign here.
- Sir, sir please.

731
01:02:01,551 --> 01:02:03,109
Sir, can't we reach some compromise.

732
01:02:03,219 --> 01:02:04,709
Sir, please.
- Shall I arrest you?

733
01:02:17,567 --> 01:02:19,034
How will get out of here?

734
01:02:19,702 --> 01:02:21,761
Why don't you understand?

735
01:02:22,572 --> 01:02:26,565
Not these. I'm talking about the
ones in the vault. - Right, sir.

736
01:02:28,344 --> 01:02:30,642
I know. I've seen these.

737
01:02:30,713 --> 01:02:32,010
Brother.
- Yes.

738
01:02:32,281 --> 01:02:33,509
I need a little help.

739
01:02:34,951 --> 01:02:37,442
Brother.
- No, no. It's okay. It's my duty.

740
01:02:37,553 --> 01:02:39,043
Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

741
01:04:14,350 --> 01:04:15,476
Hello.

742
01:04:16,185 --> 01:04:17,345
Yes.

743
01:04:18,287 --> 01:04:20,016
Yes, Mr. Banerjee. How are you?

744
01:04:22,291 --> 01:04:23,485
When?

745
01:04:24,660 --> 01:04:25,820
Where?

746
01:04:29,065 --> 01:04:30,225
How many people?

747
01:04:31,601 --> 01:04:32,761
FIR?

748
01:04:33,836 --> 01:04:35,633
No, Mr. Banerjee. Whether
anyone reports this or not...

749
01:04:35,705 --> 01:04:37,366
I want this news to be reported.

750
01:04:38,507 --> 01:04:40,805
This has to get printed
in tomorrow's newspapers.

751
01:04:41,110 --> 01:04:42,304
I don't care.

752
01:04:42,745 --> 01:04:44,406
It has to be printed big and bold.

753
01:04:44,513 --> 01:04:45,571
Alright? Thank you.

754
01:04:45,681 --> 01:04:46,773
Goodnight.

755
01:04:58,594 --> 01:05:00,357
Find anything?
- Nothing, sir.

756
01:05:01,597 --> 01:05:02,962
Kolkata, Bada Bazaar.

757
01:05:03,266 --> 01:05:06,064
A fake income tax team
of four conducted a raid.

758
01:05:06,903 --> 01:05:08,768
No business man wants to report this.

759
01:05:09,939 --> 01:05:12,134
But it will still be in
tomorrow's newspapers.

760
01:05:13,976 --> 01:05:16,001
Let's make these rascals nervous.

761
01:05:38,234 --> 01:05:39,360
Congratulations.

762
01:05:46,976 --> 01:05:49,240
Bogus income Tax...

763
01:05:51,681 --> 01:05:53,945
Four people came dressed...

764
01:05:54,016 --> 01:05:55,210
Ajay.

765
01:06:05,594 --> 01:06:06,788
Sir.
- Sir.

766
01:06:07,430 --> 01:06:08,590
Sir.

767
01:06:08,965 --> 01:06:10,091
Sir.

768
01:06:11,434 --> 01:06:12,594
Found him.

769
01:06:22,244 --> 01:06:23,973
Are you sure?
- 100%

770
01:06:24,180 --> 01:06:26,045
He said his name was P.K. Sharma...

771
01:06:26,382 --> 01:06:28,282
and I can never forget one thing.

772
01:06:28,517 --> 01:06:30,542
'Always remember, Ranveer Singh.'

773
01:06:30,619 --> 01:06:32,246
'Real power comes from the heart.'

774
01:06:33,289 --> 01:06:36,486
'Always listen to your heart.'

775
01:06:36,592 --> 01:06:38,287
It's definitely him, sir.

776
01:06:40,129 --> 01:06:41,721
They've published about us.

777
01:06:41,797 --> 01:06:43,924
It's clearly written here
Four people posed as...

778
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,262
Ajay, what now?

779
01:06:46,102 --> 01:06:47,592
Mr. Sharma, you always said...

780
01:06:47,670 --> 01:06:49,934
Let's do something big,
and then retire.

781
01:06:51,207 --> 01:06:52,731
Do you have something in mind?

782
01:06:53,042 --> 01:06:55,010
Where?
- Mumbai.

783
01:06:55,544 --> 01:06:56,704
Is it worth it?

784
01:06:56,812 --> 01:06:58,677
You'll have to work harder.

785
01:06:58,814 --> 01:07:01,681
It might be painful,
but the amount is huge.

786
01:07:02,218 --> 01:07:03,549
Is this the right time?

787
01:07:03,619 --> 01:07:04,847
Because, now everyone knows...

788
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:06,512
there's something
called a fake CBl.

789
01:07:06,889 --> 01:07:08,857
This is the best time.

790
01:07:10,026 --> 01:07:11,220
I'll call you later.

791
01:07:11,293 --> 01:07:12,487
Look after yourself.

792
01:07:17,933 --> 01:07:19,696
What's the address?
- Chandigarh.

793
01:07:19,835 --> 01:07:21,097
Shall I get him?

794
01:07:23,172 --> 01:07:24,605
And what will you do after that?

795
01:07:25,841 --> 01:07:28,036
Lock him up, interrogate him.

796
01:07:28,144 --> 01:07:30,112
He'll be released the next day.

797
01:07:30,613 --> 01:07:32,205
No one will testify against him.

798
01:07:32,982 --> 01:07:34,574
Say hello to him.
- Yes, sir.

799
01:07:35,584 --> 01:07:36,744
What?

800
01:07:37,453 --> 01:07:38,784
Tape his calls.

801
01:08:38,881 --> 01:08:44,649
Even if Lord or
this world forsakes me.

802
01:08:45,054 --> 01:08:51,391
Even if my body or
my soul deceives me.

803
01:08:51,894 --> 01:08:57,230
But my beloved, the
love between us...

804
01:08:57,299 --> 01:09:01,702
Let the love
between us stay forever.

805
01:09:01,770 --> 01:09:06,798
The love between us...

806
01:09:08,144 --> 01:09:10,044
When did you arrive?
- Yesterday.

807
01:09:10,980 --> 01:09:13,414
We're leaving now? But my luggage.

808
01:09:13,482 --> 01:09:16,144
No, not today.
- Why a taxi?

809
01:09:16,785 --> 01:09:18,218
Where's your car?

810
01:09:18,754 --> 01:09:19,880
I sold it.

811
01:09:28,297 --> 01:09:29,764
Make him quiet.

812
01:09:34,970 --> 01:09:37,200
Hello.
- Hello.

813
01:09:37,406 --> 01:09:38,839
I'm from the telephone exchange.

814
01:09:38,941 --> 01:09:40,966
225463?
- Yes.

815
01:09:41,043 --> 01:09:42,510
Is there a disturbance in the line?

816
01:09:43,512 --> 01:09:44,604
No.

817
01:09:45,047 --> 01:09:46,309
Then why lodge a complaint.

818
01:09:46,615 --> 01:09:48,242
But we didn't.

819
01:09:48,851 --> 01:09:50,546
225463?

820
01:09:51,220 --> 01:09:52,687
That's my number.

821
01:09:52,922 --> 01:09:54,890
Then someone else from
your family must have.

822
01:09:55,291 --> 01:09:56,451
Show me your phone.

823
01:09:57,760 --> 01:09:58,852
Come.

824
01:10:10,372 --> 01:10:11,566
Here's the phone.

825
01:10:14,143 --> 01:10:15,735
There's a slight disturbance.

826
01:10:17,713 --> 01:10:20,238
I don't hear a thing.
- What are you saying?

827
01:10:21,350 --> 01:10:23,181
Don't you hear a 'Whoosh' sound?

828
01:10:25,421 --> 01:10:27,821
I don't hear anything.

829
01:10:28,324 --> 01:10:31,191
It's worse for the
caller on the other side.

830
01:10:31,393 --> 01:10:32,485
I'll show you.

831
01:10:32,728 --> 01:10:36,220
These two wires
shouldn't touch each other.

832
01:10:36,565 --> 01:10:40,228
If they do, then you
hear that 'Whoosh' sound.

833
01:10:40,536 --> 01:10:42,504
Don't you clean it?

834
01:10:43,706 --> 01:10:44,798
That's the problem.

835
01:10:44,907 --> 01:10:46,568
People don't clean
their telephone sets...

836
01:10:46,642 --> 01:10:48,940
and we're
burdened with all the work.

837
01:10:50,012 --> 01:10:51,912
You see, the
circumference can be cleaned...

838
01:10:51,981 --> 01:10:54,006
from inside as well as outside.

839
01:10:56,619 --> 01:10:57,779
Let's check.

840
01:11:01,690 --> 01:11:02,987
Hello, sir.

841
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:07,854
Hello.
- 225463.

842
01:11:08,264 --> 01:11:09,492
All okay, sir?

843
01:11:09,598 --> 01:11:10,724
Yes, all okay.

844
01:11:10,833 --> 01:11:12,858
Any disturbance?

845
01:11:12,935 --> 01:11:14,835
Gurmeet, disconnect
the call and get out.

846
01:11:16,472 --> 01:11:17,734
Fine, sir.

847
01:11:20,576 --> 01:11:21,975
That's done.

848
01:11:26,382 --> 01:11:27,849
When are you leaving again?

849
01:11:28,684 --> 01:11:29,878
Today evening.

850
01:11:30,152 --> 01:11:31,346
And when will you return?

851
01:11:33,188 --> 01:11:34,280
Never.

852
01:11:35,824 --> 01:11:36,950
Why?

853
01:11:37,459 --> 01:11:40,724
Because soon the local
police will be looking for me.

854
01:11:41,730 --> 01:11:42,992
Is it important?

855
01:11:45,834 --> 01:11:47,233
Last time.

856
01:11:47,536 --> 01:11:48,867
And what if
something happens this time?

857
01:11:48,937 --> 01:11:50,234
Don't scare me.

858
01:11:52,441 --> 01:11:55,035
We'll meet directly on Thursday now.

859
01:11:55,611 --> 01:11:57,238
4 o'clock, in the airport.

860
01:11:59,782 --> 01:12:02,444
Ajay, I'm willing to
leave with you right now.

861
01:12:03,285 --> 01:12:05,014
Do you have to take this risk?
- Priya...

862
01:12:05,387 --> 01:12:06,752
Why don't you understand?

863
01:12:06,855 --> 01:12:08,083
What if something goes wrong?

864
01:12:08,157 --> 01:12:10,352
Nothing will happen?
- What if something does?

865
01:12:10,426 --> 01:12:12,121
Nothing will happen, Priya?
- Ajay.

866
01:12:13,662 --> 01:12:15,289
If anything happens to you, I...

867
01:12:19,401 --> 01:12:20,732
Shall I leave you home?

868
01:12:21,737 --> 01:12:23,102
How much more will you leave me?

869
01:12:23,505 --> 01:12:30,934
Just you... you dwell in my heart.

870
01:12:31,046 --> 01:12:38,009
Just like dreams... in my eyes.

871
01:12:38,187 --> 01:12:41,850
Without you... my
eyes brim with tears.

872
01:12:41,957 --> 01:12:45,586
Without you... I don't exist either.

873
01:12:45,661 --> 01:12:52,760
You mean everything to me.

874
01:12:53,068 --> 01:13:00,634
Just you... you dwell in my heart.

875
01:13:00,709 --> 01:13:08,673
Just like dreams... in my eyes.

876
01:13:49,458 --> 01:13:56,796
Love... picks only a handful few.

877
01:13:56,965 --> 01:14:04,064
Gives them dreams, and sorrows.

878
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:11,707
Shatters all their
dreams in a minute.

879
01:14:12,347 --> 01:14:15,874
It can ruin one.

880
01:14:16,185 --> 01:14:19,677
Without you... my
eyes brim with tears.

881
01:14:19,788 --> 01:14:23,417
Without you... I don't exist either.

882
01:14:23,492 --> 01:14:27,155
You mean everything to me.

883
01:14:27,362 --> 01:14:34,768
Just you... you dwell in my heart.

884
01:14:34,837 --> 01:14:42,837
Just like dreams... in my eyes.

885
01:14:49,051 --> 01:14:52,248
Sister... Sister...

886
01:15:14,343 --> 01:15:21,749
The journey that's love...
is a short one.

887
01:15:21,817 --> 01:15:28,780
But lovers... are
always treading on this path.

888
01:15:29,925 --> 01:15:36,592
The path of love is
a never-ending one.

889
01:15:37,232 --> 01:15:40,861
It's undying.

890
01:15:40,969 --> 01:15:44,598
Without you... my
eyes brim with tears.

891
01:15:44,673 --> 01:15:48,302
Without you... I don't exist either.

892
01:15:48,410 --> 01:15:52,107
You mean everything to me.

893
01:15:52,180 --> 01:15:59,609
Just you... you dwell in my heart.

894
01:15:59,721 --> 01:16:06,991
Just like dreams... in my eyes.

895
01:16:57,279 --> 01:17:00,339
Operator, 0172225463.

896
01:17:09,224 --> 01:17:10,953
Hello.
- Hello.

897
01:17:11,393 --> 01:17:12,519
Yes, Ajju.

898
01:17:13,095 --> 01:17:14,187
Did you get the tickets?

899
01:17:14,396 --> 01:17:15,454
Yes, I did.

900
01:17:15,731 --> 01:17:17,255
Did you talk to Joginder and lqbal?

901
01:17:17,432 --> 01:17:18,763
Yes, I did.

902
01:17:18,934 --> 01:17:20,595
They will meet you at Delhi Airport.

903
01:17:21,203 --> 01:17:22,295
I see.

904
01:17:23,005 --> 01:17:24,836
What's wrong? You sound worried.

905
01:17:26,375 --> 01:17:27,706
Nothing, just tired.

906
01:17:28,910 --> 01:17:30,571
You're not allowed to tire right now.

907
01:17:30,879 --> 01:17:33,677
Once we do this last job,
you can retire for good.

908
01:17:36,118 --> 01:17:38,416
See you tomorrow at
the airport. Goodnight.

909
01:17:38,887 --> 01:17:40,149
Goodnight, son.

910
01:17:52,134 --> 01:17:53,624
Did you talk to Joginder and lqbal?

911
01:17:56,004 --> 01:17:58,768
Once we do this last job,
you can retire for good.

912
01:18:04,312 --> 01:18:05,404
Yes, Deepak.

913
01:18:05,580 --> 01:18:07,707
Where did Sharma get
the last call from?

914
01:18:09,618 --> 01:18:12,951
Bombay, Sea Castle.

915
01:18:13,822 --> 01:18:17,280
435276.

916
01:18:17,693 --> 01:18:18,751
Room no?

917
01:18:19,561 --> 01:18:20,789
1453.

918
01:18:21,697 --> 01:18:23,858
Sir, Sharma received a call
from some Ajju from Bombay.

919
01:18:23,932 --> 01:18:26,799
Ajju's staying in Sea Castle,
room no. 1453.

920
01:18:27,169 --> 01:18:28,534
Sir, Sharma will be meeting...

921
01:18:28,603 --> 01:18:31,071
some Joginder and lqbal
at Delhi airport tomorrow.

922
01:18:31,306 --> 01:18:33,365
And they will leave for
Bombay in the evening.

923
01:18:33,875 --> 01:18:36,105
Ajju will pick them up
from Bombay airport.

924
01:18:36,678 --> 01:18:39,272
Sir, they were mentioning
something about a last job.

925
01:18:40,449 --> 01:18:42,110
Send someone after Sharma.

926
01:18:42,451 --> 01:18:45,147
I want details of his every
movement from Chandigarh to here.

927
01:18:45,754 --> 01:18:47,153
Call Solanki at Bombay office...

928
01:18:47,255 --> 01:18:48,415
Sir, Solanki's been transferred.

929
01:18:48,490 --> 01:18:49,851
Who's been appointed in his place?

930
01:18:51,393 --> 01:18:52,485
Solanki, sir.

931
01:18:54,896 --> 01:18:56,697
Tell him to get all the
information on Ajju's.

932
01:18:56,965 --> 01:18:59,490
And book three tickets
for tomorrow for Bombay.

933
01:18:59,568 --> 01:19:00,660
Yes, sir.

934
01:19:02,237 --> 01:19:03,363
Show me this one again.

935
01:19:03,638 --> 01:19:05,503
I'll be back soon.

936
01:19:05,574 --> 01:19:06,871
Yes.
- Don't worry.

937
01:19:07,075 --> 01:19:09,600
Fix the bedroom latch.
- Yes.

938
01:19:10,011 --> 01:19:11,774
And look after him. Okay.
- Yes.

939
01:19:11,880 --> 01:19:13,677
See you. Okay.

940
01:21:03,692 --> 01:21:04,784
That's the three.

941
01:21:06,928 --> 01:21:08,589
Excuse me. Phone please.

942
01:21:21,676 --> 01:21:24,645
They say Gyaani Dayal
Singh isn't President...

943
01:21:24,746 --> 01:21:26,179
it's Rajiv Gandhi.

944
01:22:04,986 --> 01:22:06,078
Yes.

945
01:22:09,524 --> 01:22:10,684
Here.

946
01:22:12,961 --> 01:22:14,428
20 rupees.

947
01:22:16,331 --> 01:22:17,559
Thank you.

948
01:22:27,142 --> 01:22:30,043
That man who just left, what
ad did he give you to publish?

949
01:22:30,412 --> 01:22:31,538
This one.

950
01:23:15,523 --> 01:23:17,115
Follow that taxi. Come on.

951
01:23:48,189 --> 01:23:49,315
Hello.
- Thank you.

952
01:23:50,658 --> 01:23:51,750
Sir.
- Jai Hind.

953
01:23:51,926 --> 01:23:54,207
You've to keep an eye on the
people that just went inside.

954
01:24:21,022 --> 01:24:22,143
Sir, this is our team and...

955
01:24:22,190 --> 01:24:23,950
they will be
working with us on this team.

956
01:24:24,159 --> 01:24:26,150
Okay, let's start from Ajju.

957
01:24:26,361 --> 01:24:27,919
Sir, he's been staying in
Hotel Sea Castel since yesterday...

958
01:24:27,996 --> 01:24:29,759
under the name of A. K Wardhan.

959
01:24:29,998 --> 01:24:32,865
He's given a address of
Trivandrum in the register.

960
01:24:33,101 --> 01:24:34,193
I checked it out, sir.

961
01:24:34,335 --> 01:24:35,427
That address was a fake.

962
01:24:35,570 --> 01:24:38,050
Sir, today morning he left the
hotel and went to 'Jhari Mandi'.

963
01:24:38,139 --> 01:24:40,403
It's a notoriously famous
place known for forgery.

964
01:24:40,542 --> 01:24:43,375
Sir, from there he went to a
local ad booking agency in Bandra.

965
01:24:43,545 --> 01:24:45,638
He's booked this ad for tomorrow.

966
01:24:49,250 --> 01:24:50,342
Wanted 50 dynamic graduates...

967
01:24:50,418 --> 01:24:54,252
for intelligence
officer's post and secoo...

968
01:24:54,355 --> 01:24:57,222
Security.
- Yes, security officer's post.

969
01:24:57,292 --> 01:24:59,817
Males and females come personally...

970
01:24:59,894 --> 01:25:02,761
for interview with bio-data,
certificates...

971
01:25:02,831 --> 01:25:06,790
passport size photo
on 18th March, 1987...

972
01:25:06,901 --> 01:25:08,801
at Hotel Sea Castle.

973
01:25:09,070 --> 01:25:12,562
Enquiry counter
between 10 am and 5 pm.

974
01:25:13,074 --> 01:25:14,871
What's this...
- This is really big, Ajju.

975
01:25:14,976 --> 01:25:16,068
Because it's the last one.

976
01:25:16,978 --> 01:25:19,003
But why do you need so many people?

977
01:25:19,714 --> 01:25:20,840
Because it's a big job.

978
01:25:21,683 --> 01:25:23,913
Consider that we'll
need public support.

979
01:25:24,886 --> 01:25:26,513
They're planning something big.

980
01:25:27,322 --> 01:25:28,448
Where else did Ajju go?

981
01:25:28,556 --> 01:25:29,682
From Bandra he went to the airport.

982
01:25:29,791 --> 01:25:31,816
He picked up the three and then hotel.

983
01:25:32,460 --> 01:25:33,552
Solanki.
- Sir.

984
01:25:33,862 --> 01:25:36,888
We need a new base. The closer
to their hotel, the better. - Yes.

985
01:25:36,965 --> 01:25:39,058
I need 10-12 people
for their interview.

986
01:25:39,267 --> 01:25:40,859
Give me some really smart men...

987
01:25:40,935 --> 01:25:42,800
who can crack their interview.

988
01:25:44,038 --> 01:25:47,974
Let's find out what they exactly want.

989
01:25:48,309 --> 01:25:49,435
Sir.

990
01:25:49,511 --> 01:25:50,603
Sir.

991
01:25:50,778 --> 01:25:52,507
Why not go ask Sharma directly?

992
01:25:55,383 --> 01:25:58,409
Ranveer, I know why you're
in a hurry to meet Sharma?

993
01:25:59,721 --> 01:26:02,622
But, use my mind as well.

994
01:26:03,291 --> 01:26:04,451

All you do is eat and
sleep the entire day.

1004
01:27:58,840 --> 01:28:00,205
You don't move a muscle.

1005
01:28:00,275 --> 01:28:01,902
Look at this ad. Read it.

1006
01:28:38,212 --> 01:28:39,338

You please sit.

1028
01:31:29,217 --> 01:31:30,878
Why do you want to join the bureau?

1029
01:31:30,952 --> 01:31:32,749
There's a lot of
corruption in our country.

1030
01:31:32,987 --> 01:31:34,420
The entire system's in a mess.

1031
01:31:34,722 --> 01:31:36,781
Our enemies are weakening our system.

1032
01:31:37,225 --> 01:31:39,955
We need to uproot the enemies, sir.

1033
01:31:40,361 --> 01:31:42,795
Will you uproot them?
- We'll do it together, sir.

1034
01:31:43,231 --> 01:31:44,892
You... and me.

1035

to corruption, sir.

1036

1037
01:31:50,872 --> 01:31:52,703
Because, I'm born intelligent, sir.

1038
01:31:52,773 --> 01:31:54,707
I want to eradicate all the thieves.

1039
01:31:56,611 --> 01:31:58,442

1048
01:32:23,004 --> 01:32:25,302
Sir, Sudeep Chatterjee.

1049
01:32:25,773 --> 01:32:27,001
Prakash Madhav, sir.

1050
01:32:27,174 --> 01:32:28,436
Where else have you
worked prior to this?

1051
01:32:28,576 --> 01:32:30,373
I'm a writer, sir.
Shall I narrate something?

1052
01:32:43,791 --> 01:32:45,486
Do you know how to drive a car?

1053
01:32:45,626 --> 01:32:47,423
I was born on the driver's seat.

1054
01:32:52,667 --> 01:32:53,759
Did you see anyone?

1055
01:32:54,302 --> 01:32:55,462
No, sir.

1056
01:32:56,370 --> 01:32:58,338
Why do you think you're
the right person for the job?

1057
01:32:58,406 --> 01:33:00,397
Sir, I...
- Please answer in English.

1058
01:33:00,474 --> 01:33:01,736

something to my country.

I am honest and disciplined, sir.

1063
01:33:09,150 --> 01:33:10,344
I am hardworking, sir.

1064
01:33:10,518 --> 01:33:13,351
Even when I was a small kid,
I wanted to do my country.

1065
01:33:13,454 --> 01:33:15,081
And I've good work ethics.

1066
01:33:20,027 --> 01:33:22,188
People's wanted to be film-stars,
cricketers...

1067
01:33:22,263 --> 01:33:24,197
but I always
wanted to be intelligence.

1068
01:33:24,865 --> 01:33:25,923
Wait outside.

1069
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:28,732

01:34:21,188 --> 01:34:22,815
Fine. Okay.

1082
01:34:25,092 --> 01:34:26,252
Sir, it was Rane.

1083
01:34:26,527 --> 01:34:27,888
More and Gupte have been selected.

1084
01:34:28,929 --> 01:34:30,123
Congratulations, sir.

1085
01:34:40,408 --> 01:34:42,137
And, Kishen Chaudhary.

1086
01:34:42,510 --> 01:34:43,568
Sir.

1087
01:34:45,613 --> 01:34:47,581
Congratulations, all of you.

1088
01:34:47,782 --> 01:34:49,181
Thanks, sir.

1089
01:34:49,583 --> 01:34:54,680
But, I am sorry... all of
you can leave. Thank you.

1090
01:34:54,755 --> 01:34:56,655
They've chosen the wrong people.

1091
01:35:12,540 --> 01:35:14,303
Many, many congratulations.

1092
01:35:15,076 --> 01:35:17,101
My name is A.K. Wardhan.

1093
01:35:17,411 --> 01:35:19,174
You are Special 26.

1094
01:35:19,747 --> 01:35:22,215
You've proven to be the smartest,
intelligent...

1095
01:35:22,283 --> 01:35:23,978
and the best.

1096
01:35:24,351 --> 01:35:26,683
But our selection
process isn't over yet.

1097
01:35:27,188 --> 01:35:28,246
Tomorrow...

1098
01:35:28,723 --> 01:35:30,987
Stand straight. Straight!

1099
01:35:33,194 --> 01:35:36,220
Tomorrow morning at 11 am
you will all report here.

1100
01:35:36,664 --> 01:35:39,326
Short hair, and formally dressed.

1101
01:35:39,934 --> 01:35:44,928
Mr. Roy and Mr.
Shukla, will give a lecture.

1102
01:35:45,606 --> 01:35:47,130
This class will last two hours.

1103
01:35:47,208 --> 01:35:49,608
Post-lunch you will
have a final exam...

1104
01:35:49,710 --> 01:35:51,678
which we call practical.

1105
01:35:52,146 --> 01:35:54,774
In the practical, you'll
be a part of our CBl team...

1106
01:35:54,882 --> 01:35:56,406
that will conduct a raid.

1107
01:35:56,817 --> 01:35:58,808
The whole idea of putting
you guys in this situation...

1108
01:35:58,919 --> 01:36:01,615
is to verify if you
can handle pressure or not.

1109
01:36:01,789 --> 01:36:04,349
Or let me correct myself,
whether you can handle...

1110
01:36:04,425 --> 01:36:06,120
extreme pressure or not.

1111
01:36:24,044 --> 01:36:26,103
Hey. Don't be scared, get it.

1112
01:36:26,180 --> 01:36:27,374
Yes, sir.
- Good.

1113
01:36:29,049 --> 01:36:30,607
Tamil?
- Yes, sir.

1114
01:36:30,785 --> 01:36:32,514
CBl is not just wind, its Tsunami...

1115
01:36:32,653 --> 01:36:34,143
Whoever it maybe, Whoosh.

1116
01:36:34,421 --> 01:36:36,184
That's all. We will sweep him up!

1117
01:36:36,290 --> 01:36:39,487
Boss. When you say it once, it's
like saying it a hundred times!

1118
01:36:39,827 --> 01:36:40,885
Good.

1119
01:36:44,965 --> 01:36:46,227
Patel.
- Yes, sir.

1120
01:36:46,433 --> 01:36:48,333
Do your job with hard work...

1121
01:36:48,402 --> 01:36:51,269
that law-breakers start
sweating thinking about us.

1122
01:36:51,405 --> 01:36:52,497
Yes, sir.

1123
01:36:55,843 --> 01:36:58,311
There's 4 of you and 22 of them.

1124
01:36:58,979 --> 01:37:00,469
This isn't discrimination.

1125
01:37:01,148 --> 01:37:05,050
4 of you can do what these 22 can.

1126
01:37:05,553 --> 01:37:08,954
I believe and trust you.
- Thank you, sir.

1127
01:37:09,190 --> 01:37:10,817
Remember one thing.

1128
01:37:11,392 --> 01:37:13,485
Real power comes from the heart.

1129
01:37:14,428 --> 01:37:16,521
Don't ever be scared
of anyone in life.

1130
01:37:16,931 --> 01:37:18,694
Understood?
- Yes, sir.

1131
01:37:19,366 --> 01:37:20,766
After the completion of the raid...

1132
01:37:20,835 --> 01:37:23,395
you will all report back here,
and if nothing goes wrong...

1133
01:37:23,470 --> 01:37:25,768
everyone will get
their appointment letter.

1134
01:37:26,073 --> 01:37:29,839
And then, you can all
throw a small party for all.

1135
01:37:30,344 --> 01:37:31,504
Sure, sir.

1136
01:37:36,116 --> 01:37:39,779
Ladies and Gentlemen, you're
just one step away from...

1137
01:37:39,887 --> 01:37:44,187
becoming a part of lndia's
best and intellectual agency.

1138
01:37:44,391 --> 01:37:47,952
CBl means, that you love your
country above everything else.

1139
01:37:48,362 --> 01:37:50,523
CBl means, that you will
live for your country...

1140
01:37:50,598 --> 01:37:52,361
and that you will
die for your country.

1141
01:37:52,600 --> 01:37:54,761
CBl means, that you're the best.

1142
01:37:55,236 --> 01:37:56,965
Are you the best?
- Yes, sir.

1143
01:37:57,071 --> 01:37:58,766
Are you the best?
- Yes, sir.

1144
01:37:58,839 --> 01:38:00,966
I can't hear you.
- Yes, sir!

1145
01:38:01,041 --> 01:38:03,509
I still can't hear you.
- Yes, sir!

1146
01:38:03,577 --> 01:38:05,636
These discussions
shouldn't leave this room.

1147
01:38:06,013 --> 01:38:08,641
Do you understand?
- Yes, sir!

1148
01:38:08,883 --> 01:38:10,077
Dismiss.

1149
01:38:20,561 --> 01:38:21,721
Thank you, sir.

1150
01:38:22,496 --> 01:38:23,690
Good luck.

1151
01:38:27,067 --> 01:38:28,227
Great.

1152
01:38:28,969 --> 01:38:32,097
For a minute I
forgot that we're thieves.

1153
01:38:35,576 --> 01:38:37,373
They asked us the full form of CBl.

1154
01:38:37,478 --> 01:38:38,843
They even asked me my favourite song.

1155
01:38:38,946 --> 01:38:40,538
They've asked us to report
at the conference room...

1156
01:38:40,648 --> 01:38:42,445
tomorrow at 11 am,
for some lecture.

1157
01:38:42,516 --> 01:38:44,575
They said we'll go out
for a raid post-lunch.

1158
01:38:44,752 --> 01:38:46,652
Where?
- They haven't said that yet.

1159
01:38:47,321 --> 01:38:49,881
Anything else? - They said
Congratulations, I'm the best.

1160
01:38:50,557 --> 01:38:51,956
He said I am the best, sir.

1161
01:38:55,829 --> 01:38:56,955
Fine.

1162
01:38:57,131 --> 01:38:58,758
You can go and report their tomorrow.

1163
01:38:59,400 --> 01:39:01,334
Be sharp and alert.
- Sir!

1164
01:40:36,397 --> 01:40:37,989
See you.
- Bye. Goodnight

1165
01:40:38,232 --> 01:40:40,257
Goodnight.
- Goodnight. - Goodnight. - Goodnight.

1166
01:40:40,334 --> 01:40:41,824
Sleep well.
- Goodnight.

1167
01:40:57,284 --> 01:40:58,546
Who is it?

1168
01:41:01,388 --> 01:41:03,151
Who is it?
- Room service, sir.

1169
01:41:08,695 --> 01:41:11,721
The queen of my dreams,
when will you come.

1170
01:41:11,799 --> 01:41:13,699
Life is passing by,
when will you come?

1171
01:41:13,767 --> 01:41:14,961
Come in.

1172
01:41:43,931 --> 01:41:45,489
How are you, Mr. Sharma?

1173
01:41:48,035 --> 01:41:49,627
We're from the CBl.

1174
01:41:51,738 --> 01:41:52,966
The real one.

1175
01:41:57,578 --> 01:41:58,704
So, Mr. Sharma.

1176
01:41:59,213 --> 01:42:01,511
You like playing cops-and-robbers,
don't you?

1177
01:42:01,882 --> 01:42:05,045
No, I was just...

1178
01:42:05,953 --> 01:42:09,286
I will ask you some questions,
and you will have two options.

1179
01:42:09,556 --> 01:42:11,148
Firstly, you will deny everything...

1180
01:42:11,258 --> 01:42:13,123
and say you don't know anything.

1181
01:42:13,193 --> 01:42:15,273
In that condition, we'll
be compelled to do it and...

1182
01:42:15,329 --> 01:42:20,596
in places, which was never
done to you before by anyone.

1183
01:42:21,735 --> 01:42:24,761
It will cause you a lot
of pain but, believe me...

1184
01:42:24,838 --> 01:42:28,672
you will suddenly
remember everything in detail.

1185
01:42:29,309 --> 01:42:30,276
I... I...

1186
01:42:30,377 --> 01:42:33,710
Your second option is that
you cooperate with us...

1187
01:42:33,814 --> 01:42:36,078
and save our time and effort.

1188
01:42:36,216 --> 01:42:37,649
This option won't
cause you any pain...

1189
01:42:37,718 --> 01:42:40,516
and you can expect us to
be slightly lenient with us.

1190
01:42:44,057 --> 01:42:45,456
So, let's begin.

1191
01:42:45,692 --> 01:42:47,887
First question,
where's your fake CBl team...

1192
01:42:47,961 --> 01:42:49,292
going to conduct a raid tomorrow?

1193
01:42:49,363 --> 01:42:51,297
Bhuvandas Singhania Jewels.

1194
01:42:51,398 --> 01:42:53,628
What time?
- 3 pm.

1195
01:42:53,934 --> 01:42:55,526
What's Special 26?

1196
01:42:59,740 --> 01:43:03,369
It... was a big place,
so we thought...

1197
01:43:03,443 --> 01:43:05,604
if we have more men with us...

1198
01:43:06,480 --> 01:43:07,760
So you put an ad in the paper...

1199
01:43:07,814 --> 01:43:10,510
stating Come one, come all,
it's a big heist. Help us.

1200
01:43:10,617 --> 01:43:11,777
What's the plan?

1201
01:43:14,188 --> 01:43:15,849
Tomorrow morning
we'll give them training.

1202
01:43:15,923 --> 01:43:17,083
Training?

1203
01:43:20,194 --> 01:43:22,992
I mean we'd explain them their role...

1204
01:43:23,096 --> 01:43:25,656
like what to do, how to do it.

1205
01:43:26,433 --> 01:43:31,393
We would explain them
all that and prepare them.

1206
01:43:31,672 --> 01:43:36,837
And then at 2:30, our
bus would reach the hotel.

1207
01:44:08,375 --> 01:44:09,535
Then?

1208
01:44:11,078 --> 01:44:14,070
We were supposed to go
to Opera House in it...

1209
01:44:14,147 --> 01:44:17,708
and conduct a big raid.

1210
01:45:02,429 --> 01:45:04,624
We're from the CBl! No one moves!

1211
01:45:04,731 --> 01:45:06,358
Come on, start.

1212
01:45:09,569 --> 01:45:10,729
Come on, get it.

1213
01:45:10,804 --> 01:45:12,135
Get in, quickly.

1214
01:45:12,205 --> 01:45:13,832
Come on, come on, quickly.

1215
01:45:13,940 --> 01:45:15,066
Hurry up.

1216
01:45:19,613 --> 01:45:22,275
Sir.. please sir.. sorry sir..

1217
01:45:42,869 --> 01:45:44,564
Pick up everything.

1218
01:45:58,352 --> 01:46:02,516
We would flee before
anyone knew what happened?

1219
01:46:02,756 --> 01:46:07,193
We planned to loot 2
crores in 30 minutes.

1220
01:46:09,930 --> 01:46:12,524
What's your Ajju's background?

1221
01:46:16,470 --> 01:46:18,461
He wanted to join the CBl.

1222
01:46:27,848 --> 01:46:29,907
He had cleared the written exam.

1223
01:46:30,450 --> 01:46:32,008
But failed in the interview.

1224
01:46:39,993 --> 01:46:42,985
He failed in the exam and he was hurt.

1225
01:46:43,697 --> 01:46:45,722
So he started a fake CBl team.

1226
01:46:48,735 --> 01:46:50,703
How many raids have
you conducted so far?

1227
01:46:55,675 --> 01:46:58,508
We were supposed to
complete half century tomorrow.

1228
01:46:58,578 --> 01:46:59,772
What the...

1229
01:47:00,547 --> 01:47:02,606
I've to admit one thing.

1230
01:47:03,350 --> 01:47:04,578
There's just four of you...

1231
01:47:04,651 --> 01:47:06,881
but you've spread a chaos.

1232
01:47:08,221 --> 01:47:09,688
Not four.

1233
01:47:11,658 --> 01:47:14,422
People like him help us as well.

1234
01:47:15,529 --> 01:47:17,997
Sir, can I talk to him
in private for a minute?

1235
01:47:18,498 --> 01:47:21,331
Why a minute, you can talk
to him all you want tomorrow.

1236
01:47:21,468 --> 01:47:22,696
Yes.

1237
01:47:23,036 --> 01:47:24,628
So, tell us, Mr. Sharma.

1238
01:47:25,372 --> 01:47:28,102
Do you want to be safe
or go down with them?

1239
01:47:28,475 --> 01:47:29,601
Let me tell you...

1240
01:47:29,709 --> 01:47:31,709
jail isn't a great
place for people of your age.

1241
01:47:34,014 --> 01:47:37,040
Sir... sir, another option.

1242
01:47:37,150 --> 01:47:39,880
I've children.

1243
01:47:39,986 --> 01:47:42,216
You should've thought that before.

1244
01:47:43,056 --> 01:47:45,286
I did...

1245
01:47:45,525 --> 01:47:48,323
Tell us. We don't have time.

1246
01:47:53,300 --> 01:47:55,131
Mr. Sharma.

1247
01:48:06,580 --> 01:48:08,343
What will I have to do?

1248
01:48:08,915 --> 01:48:11,406
Just do as you were supposed to.

1249
01:48:11,852 --> 01:48:13,877
Forget that we ever met.

1250
01:48:13,987 --> 01:48:16,888
Everything should go
as it was supposed to.

1251
01:48:16,990 --> 01:48:19,788
Let me tell you, that a
few of our officers...

1252
01:48:19,860 --> 01:48:21,657
are in your Special 26 team.

1253
01:48:22,128 --> 01:48:24,187
So don't try to act smart.

1254
01:48:24,531 --> 01:48:28,490
I want to arrest them, not kill them.

1255
01:48:38,512 --> 01:48:39,706
What's wrong?

1256
01:48:42,249 --> 01:48:44,581
I just remembered something.

1257
01:48:45,218 --> 01:48:49,655
Ajju always said There's
no one who can catch him.

1258
01:48:52,325 --> 01:48:55,317
Over-confidence has led to the
downfall of many, Mr. Sharma.

1259
01:48:55,862 --> 01:48:58,057
Ajju's no different.

1260
01:49:02,369 --> 01:49:04,269
Will you treat him too harsh...

1261
01:49:04,337 --> 01:49:07,067
Stop worrying about him
and think about yourself.

1262
01:49:07,574 --> 01:49:08,905
Get some sleep.

1263
01:49:08,975 --> 01:49:11,000
You've a busy day tomorrow.

1264
01:49:11,978 --> 01:49:13,172
Goodnight.

1265
01:49:35,235 --> 01:49:37,100
Brief More and Gupte again.

1266
01:49:37,170 --> 01:49:38,194
We'll meet tomorrow morning.

1267
01:49:38,271 --> 01:49:40,102
Goodnight.
- Goodnight, sir.

1268
01:49:48,214 --> 01:49:49,772
Sorry.
- It's okay.

1269
01:50:43,103 --> 01:50:44,331
Sir.

1270
01:50:50,677 --> 01:50:52,474
All that money for one drink?

1271
01:50:52,812 --> 01:50:55,007
How much?
- 30 ml.

1272
01:50:55,615 --> 01:50:57,742
Anything smaller?
- No, sir.

1273
01:50:58,551 --> 01:51:00,143
Fine. Get me this one.

1274
01:51:00,820 --> 01:51:02,082
Okay, sir.

1275
01:51:11,431 --> 01:51:12,591
Hello.

1276
01:51:13,033 --> 01:51:14,261
Hello.

1277
01:51:14,968 --> 01:51:16,833
Waseem.
- Wardhan.

1278
01:51:18,972 --> 01:51:20,701
What do you do, Mr. Wardhan?

1279
01:51:21,374 --> 01:51:22,671
Import-export.

1280
01:51:22,742 --> 01:51:24,073
Excuse me, sir.

1281
01:51:24,144 --> 01:51:25,543
Sir, your drink.

1282
01:51:26,780 --> 01:51:29,112
Sir, soda?
- I didn't ask for soda.

1283
01:51:29,215 --> 01:51:30,443
Sir, it's complimentary.

1284
01:51:30,583 --> 01:51:33,416
Go ahead, pour it. That's it.

1285
01:51:33,520 --> 01:51:35,112
Sir, water.
- Yes.

1286
01:51:37,490 --> 01:51:38,980
What do you do?

1287
01:51:40,060 --> 01:51:41,550
Government job.

1288
01:51:43,997 --> 01:51:45,089
What are you saying?

1289
01:51:45,165 --> 01:51:46,826
The government works?

1290
01:51:46,900 --> 01:51:48,959
Cheers.
- Oh... Cheers.

1291
01:51:50,970 --> 01:51:53,268
You've a lot of
complaints with the government.

1292
01:51:53,339 --> 01:51:55,967
Only the weak complain, Mr. Waseem.

1293
01:51:56,776 --> 01:51:58,539
And people like you.

1294
01:51:58,745 --> 01:52:01,908
People like me just have
their drink and live their life.

1295
01:52:01,981 --> 01:52:03,243
What else?

1296
01:52:03,349 --> 01:52:04,873
What a thought.

1297
01:52:07,654 --> 01:52:08,985
Waiter.
- Sir.

1298
01:52:09,422 --> 01:52:11,322
Put the tab on my room.
- Sure, sir.

1299
01:52:11,491 --> 01:52:13,425
Goodnight, Mr. Waseem.
- Goodnight.

1300
01:52:15,729 --> 01:52:17,526
Wardhan sir.
- Yes.

1301
01:52:17,764 --> 01:52:20,232
I think you dropped your money.

1302
01:52:23,970 --> 01:52:25,369
Is this yours?

1303
01:52:25,705 --> 01:52:27,070
Yes, it's mine.

1304
01:52:27,207 --> 01:52:28,504
Thank you.

1305
01:52:32,145 --> 01:52:33,772
What an attitude?

1306
01:52:34,748 --> 01:52:37,148
I will hunt him down personally.

1307
01:52:56,336 --> 01:52:57,701
Nitin Srivastav.

1308
01:52:58,938 --> 01:52:59,962
Kapil Gorekar.

1309
01:53:00,073 --> 01:53:01,062
Archana Mansekar.

1310
01:53:01,174 --> 01:53:02,198
Thank you.

1311
01:53:02,308 --> 01:53:03,297
Minal Jain.

1312
01:53:03,376 --> 01:53:04,707
Harish Pendekar.

1313
01:53:28,134 --> 01:53:29,158
Good morning.

1314
01:53:29,235 --> 01:53:30,755
Good morning, sir.
- Good morning, sir.

1315
01:53:33,873 --> 01:53:35,636
Hail Krishna!

1316
01:53:35,742 --> 01:53:36,766
Hail Krishna!

1317
01:53:36,876 --> 01:53:37,934
Sir.

1318
01:53:38,044 --> 01:53:39,306
Look there.

1319
01:53:53,593 --> 01:53:55,390
Yes, Solanki sir.

1320
01:53:55,628 --> 01:53:57,391
Magandas, this is Mr. Waseem Khan..

1321
01:53:57,463 --> 01:53:58,657
I see..
- From CBl.

1322
01:53:58,731 --> 01:54:00,722
CBl?

1323
01:54:01,100 --> 01:54:04,536
Why CBl...

1324
01:54:04,604 --> 01:54:05,969
That.

1325
01:54:07,407 --> 01:54:08,874
Did you see that?

1326
01:54:10,577 --> 01:54:12,772
That's exactly what they bank on.

1327
01:54:14,647 --> 01:54:17,241
Did you steal anything?
- No.

1328
01:54:17,350 --> 01:54:19,284
Plunder?
- No.

1329
01:54:19,385 --> 01:54:21,376
Then why are you so scared of the CBl?

1330
01:54:23,389 --> 01:54:25,880
Something terrible going
to happen with you instead.

1331
01:54:26,659 --> 01:54:29,492
Your shop's going to be looted.
- What?

1332
01:54:29,729 --> 01:54:31,219
When?

1333
01:54:31,698 --> 01:54:33,097
Around 3 pm.

1334
01:54:33,666 --> 01:54:35,327
Around 30 people will come here...

1335
01:54:35,435 --> 01:54:37,369
posing as CBl
officers and loot your shop.

1336
01:54:38,972 --> 01:54:40,633
Do you want to avert it?

1337
01:54:41,975 --> 01:54:44,136
Are you telling me
or giving me a choice?

1338
01:54:44,711 --> 01:54:47,737
Do you have a safer place?
- Yes.

1339
01:54:48,214 --> 01:54:49,579
My workshop.

1340
01:54:49,649 --> 01:54:50,707
How far?

1341
01:54:50,783 --> 01:54:52,876
20 minutes from here.

1342
01:54:53,186 --> 01:54:54,380
Good.

1343
01:54:54,587 --> 01:54:55,849
We'll replace your
store's jewellery...

1344
01:54:55,955 --> 01:54:58,185
with your fake
jewellery that's marked. - Yes.

1345
01:54:58,258 --> 01:54:59,987
Shift the entire stock in your shop...

1346
01:55:00,059 --> 01:55:02,687
to your workshop in half an hour.

1347
01:55:02,795 --> 01:55:04,315
Half an hour! How is it possible, sir?

1348
01:55:04,397 --> 01:55:05,455
It's possible, sir.

1349
01:55:05,531 --> 01:55:08,091
They were going to loot your
shop in 30 minutes. - I see.

1350
01:55:08,167 --> 01:55:09,691
Only your staff will
stay in your shop.

1351
01:55:09,802 --> 01:55:11,326
Okay. - Your shop will
be closed for the public.

1352
01:55:11,404 --> 01:55:14,430
Some of officers will wait
for them posing as customers.

1353
01:55:14,507 --> 01:55:16,873
Sir, when you know all this...

1354
01:55:16,943 --> 01:55:19,002
why don't you arrest them?

1355
01:55:19,112 --> 01:55:20,602
Sir.
- Yes.

1356
01:55:20,847 --> 01:55:23,907
One cannot be punished for
thinking of such crimes.

1357
01:55:23,983 --> 01:55:25,541
Only for committing it.

1358
01:55:25,618 --> 01:55:27,984
And only if we've evidence.

1359
01:55:30,223 --> 01:55:33,215
Remember that, there's
no authority over you.

1360
01:55:33,526 --> 01:55:35,790
No one has the power to stop you.

1361
01:55:35,862 --> 01:55:37,727
No one can stop you.

1362
01:55:37,964 --> 01:55:40,455
And no one has the power
to come between you...

1363
01:55:40,533 --> 01:55:41,932
and your duty.

1364
01:55:42,035 --> 01:55:44,026
Understand?
- Yes, sir.

1365
01:56:04,223 --> 01:56:08,523
Grandma.

1366
01:56:13,199 --> 01:56:14,564
I am leaving.

1367
01:57:09,689 --> 01:57:10,781
Keep this in there.

1368
01:57:10,857 --> 01:57:12,119
Keep this over there.

1369
01:57:12,825 --> 01:57:14,520
I'll make a call.
- Yes, sir.

1370
01:57:14,827 --> 01:57:16,124
This one.

1371
01:57:27,874 --> 01:57:29,466
Sir.
- Rahul, what's going on there?

1372
01:57:29,542 --> 01:57:30,907
Training, sir.

1373
01:57:30,977 --> 01:57:32,808
Anything to worry?
- Nothing, sir.

1374
01:57:39,419 --> 01:57:40,818
Solanki.
- Sir.

1375
01:57:44,590 --> 01:57:47,252
No madam, today the shop
is closed for customers.

1376
01:57:47,326 --> 01:57:48,554
You please come tomorrow.

1377
01:57:49,662 --> 01:57:50,890
Sir.

1378
01:58:00,306 --> 01:58:02,069
I want a sniper there.
- Yes.

1379
01:58:02,141 --> 01:58:04,405
Send few of your men
to both the lanes.

1380
01:58:04,510 --> 01:58:07,377
Two on that corner and two on
that one, dressed in civil. - Okay.

1381
01:58:07,447 --> 01:58:08,709
Our vehicle should be stationed...

1382
01:58:08,781 --> 01:58:11,261
exactly where they park their bus,
to block it. - Okay, sir.

1383
01:58:46,486 --> 01:58:47,475
Open it.

1384
01:58:47,587 --> 01:58:48,611
Quickly.

1385
01:58:48,688 --> 01:58:50,019
Quickly.
- Load it.

1386
01:58:50,089 --> 01:58:51,181
Quickly. Quickly.

1387
01:58:51,257 --> 01:58:52,588
How much longer?
- Sir.

1388
01:58:52,692 --> 01:58:54,182
Just a few more minutes.

1389
01:58:54,260 --> 01:58:56,455
Load the jewels and check the CCTV.
- Sir.

1390
01:59:00,032 --> 01:59:01,226
Come.

1391
01:59:03,369 --> 01:59:04,631
Go.

1392
01:59:14,213 --> 01:59:15,407
Okay, guys.

1393
01:59:15,515 --> 01:59:17,142
You can have your lunch now.

1394
01:59:17,216 --> 01:59:18,478
See you in 30 minutes.

1395
01:59:18,584 --> 01:59:19,983
Thank you, sir.

1396
01:59:40,006 --> 01:59:41,234
What's wrong?

1397
01:59:44,277 --> 01:59:45,471
Nothing.

1398
01:59:47,013 --> 01:59:48,241
Nervous?

1399
01:59:49,148 --> 01:59:50,775
Can't handle it anymore.

1400
01:59:54,020 --> 01:59:55,351
I've grown old.

1401
01:59:58,191 --> 01:59:59,453
This is the last one.

1402
01:59:59,692 --> 02:00:00,886
Enjoy it.

1403
02:00:01,994 --> 02:00:05,293
Don't worry. I'm leading today.

1404
02:00:07,333 --> 02:00:09,563
You can leave them in the bus.

1405
02:00:09,902 --> 02:00:12,598
I will come along with
Joginder and lqbal in the car.

1406
02:00:14,207 --> 02:00:15,401
Okay.

1407
02:00:30,623 --> 02:00:33,649
Yes, Rahul. - Sir, its lunch-break.
They're on schedule.

1408
02:00:33,793 --> 02:00:35,727
Fine, inform me as soon as
the bus leaves from there.

1409
02:00:35,861 --> 02:00:36,919
Right, sir.

1410
02:00:38,097 --> 02:00:39,894
Is everyone ready?
- We're fully ready, sir.

1411
02:00:39,966 --> 02:00:40,990
Okay.

1412
02:00:41,100 --> 02:00:43,000
CCTV's working perfectly, sir.

1413
02:00:43,269 --> 02:00:45,567
Find out where has the van reached?
- Sir.

1414
02:01:06,993 --> 02:01:08,221
Keep it there.

1415
02:01:17,069 --> 02:01:18,832
Take position.
- Yes, sir.

1416
02:01:37,356 --> 02:01:38,448
You understand that.

1417
02:01:38,557 --> 02:01:40,047
Mr. Roy.
- Yes, sir.

1418
02:01:40,159 --> 02:01:41,421
Sir.

1419
02:02:17,463 --> 02:02:20,864
The bus's no is MRT
- 2431.

1420
02:02:21,067 --> 02:02:22,398
Okay, out.

1421
02:02:26,305 --> 02:02:27,329
Listen, everyone.

1422
02:02:27,440 --> 02:02:28,668
Listen.

1423
02:02:28,741 --> 02:02:30,470
The bus has just left the hotel.

1424
02:02:30,543 --> 02:02:32,602
It will be here in 30 minutes.

1425
02:02:32,745 --> 02:02:35,236
If anyone wants to use
the bathroom, do it now.

1426
02:02:35,414 --> 02:02:36,711
Wait for my signal.

1427
02:02:36,782 --> 02:02:42,015
Do not... I repeat, nobody
will move until I signal.

1428
02:02:43,089 --> 02:02:44,954
Right?
- Yes, sir.

1429
02:02:46,225 --> 02:02:48,159
Ranveer. Check the status outside.
- Yes, sir.

1430
02:02:48,260 --> 02:02:49,784
Sir.
- Yes.

1431
02:02:58,771 --> 02:03:00,136
Hey.

1432
02:03:00,239 --> 02:03:02,359
What are you doing here?
Get to your positions. - Sir.

1433
02:03:32,571 --> 02:03:34,869
Sir, we're doing the real job.

1434
02:03:34,940 --> 02:03:36,635
They're just...

1435
02:04:11,710 --> 02:04:14,941
'You'll have to work hard,
might pain you as well.'

1436
02:04:15,014 --> 02:04:16,914
'But the money involved is huge.'

1437
02:04:16,982 --> 02:04:18,415
'ls the timing right?'

1438
02:04:18,517 --> 02:04:20,348
'There can't be a better time.'

1439
02:04:48,914 --> 02:04:50,745
Stop at the left.

1440
02:05:01,393 --> 02:05:03,258
Kishen.
- Sir.

1441
02:05:07,299 --> 02:05:08,698
What's this?

1442
02:05:09,635 --> 02:05:11,466
Police Headquarters, sir.

1443
02:05:12,104 --> 02:05:15,403
Kishen, I'll go
verify the order papers.

1444
02:05:15,508 --> 02:05:17,373
The rest of you get to
Bhuvandas Singhania Jewellers...

1445
02:05:17,476 --> 02:05:18,966
and wait for me and Wardhan sir.

1446
02:05:19,078 --> 02:05:20,306
No one will get down from the bus...

1447
02:05:20,412 --> 02:05:21,470
as long we get there.

1448
02:05:21,580 --> 02:05:22,740
That's an order!

1449
02:05:23,315 --> 02:05:24,714
Yes, sir.
- Good.

1450
02:05:28,621 --> 02:05:29,883
Let's go.

1451
02:05:37,997 --> 02:05:39,396
Just a minute, sir.
- Yes.

1452
02:05:39,465 --> 02:05:41,831
Sir, which way to Metro Cinema?

1453
02:05:41,901 --> 02:05:43,266
Go straight and take a left.

1454
02:05:43,335 --> 02:05:44,927
Thank you.

1455
02:06:00,619 --> 02:06:03,452
Yes. - So, you wanted to
talk to me in private?

1456
02:06:03,556 --> 02:06:06,684
You were acting too smart.
I'll slap you.

1457
02:06:07,126 --> 02:06:09,822
Come on, change your
clothes in the jeep. - Yes.

1458
02:06:10,062 --> 02:06:12,030
Shanti.
- Sir.

1459
02:06:12,097 --> 02:06:14,190
How are you?
- Fine.

1460
02:06:39,425 --> 02:06:40,915
Stop at the side.

1461
02:06:50,402 --> 02:06:51,630
Shinde.
- Sir.

1462
02:06:51,704 --> 02:06:54,400
Don't let anyone in.
- Yes, sir.

1463
02:06:58,344 --> 02:06:59,606
Who are you?

1464
02:07:07,553 --> 02:07:09,214
Come on. This is a CBl raid.

1465
02:07:09,288 --> 02:07:10,448
Everyone stop working.

1466
02:07:10,556 --> 02:07:12,285
Come on. Stop working.

1467
02:07:12,391 --> 02:07:14,256
It's a CBl raid.
- Stop your work.

1468
02:07:14,326 --> 02:07:15,987
Stop your work.
- Stop working.

1469
02:07:16,061 --> 02:07:18,120
Close that file. I said... Come on.
- I said stop the work.

1470
02:07:18,230 --> 02:07:19,527
Get up. Get up.

1471
02:07:19,632 --> 02:07:20,963
Stop your work.

1472
02:07:22,768 --> 02:07:24,497
Madam, come on. Hurry up.

1473
02:07:24,570 --> 02:07:26,561
This way.
- Come on. Get out.

1474
02:07:26,639 --> 02:07:28,402
Leave him. Hurry up.
- Come on.

1475
02:07:28,474 --> 02:07:29,600
Check their account books.

1476
02:07:29,708 --> 02:07:32,108
Check their account books.
- No one will touch the account books.

1477
02:07:32,177 --> 02:07:35,169
Keep the account
books down. No changes.

1478
02:07:35,247 --> 02:07:37,272
I said no changes...
What's written in this?

1479
02:07:37,916 --> 02:07:40,180
Hey. Keep the phone down?

1480
02:07:44,823 --> 02:07:46,290
Sir.
- What's written here?

1481
02:07:46,392 --> 02:07:48,383
What are these entries?
- I don't know, sir.

1482
02:07:48,460 --> 02:07:49,518
It's not my mistake.

1483
02:07:49,628 --> 02:07:50,720
Give me that account book.

1484
02:07:50,829 --> 02:07:52,319
What is this?
- Sir, I don't know.

1485
02:07:52,431 --> 02:07:53,728
What's this?

1486
02:07:53,832 --> 02:07:55,527
All your goods can be seized?

1487
02:07:55,634 --> 02:07:56,828
Do you know that?
- Sir, please, sir.

1488
02:07:56,935 --> 02:07:59,130
You don't have one proper paper.
- Sir.

1489
02:08:00,005 --> 02:08:01,404
Roy. Seize everything.

1490
02:08:01,473 --> 02:08:02,497
But, sir...
- Shut up!

1491
02:08:02,574 --> 02:08:05,304
Sir asked me to do this. - Bring
your sir to Crime Branch. Come on.

1492
02:08:05,377 --> 02:08:07,208
Open the vault door. Come on.
- Sir, I will lose my job.

1493
02:08:07,279 --> 02:08:08,803
Good that you do.
- Sir.

1494
02:08:08,914 --> 02:08:10,279
Open it, quickly.

1495
02:08:11,316 --> 02:08:14,615
Come on. You two, out. Out.

1496
02:08:19,024 --> 02:08:21,288
You haven't got a single proper
entry in this register. - Sir.

1497
02:08:21,393 --> 02:08:22,519
Come with me...
- Listen to me...

1498
02:08:22,628 --> 02:08:23,993
What's written here?

1499
02:08:24,063 --> 02:08:25,496
What's this?

1500
02:08:57,863 --> 02:08:59,296
Keep this inside.

1501
02:08:59,431 --> 02:09:00,693
This one too.

1502
02:09:01,366 --> 02:09:03,197
Greed is not good.

1503
02:09:04,136 --> 02:09:05,433
Keep that out.

1504
02:09:05,637 --> 02:09:07,070
That one too.

1505
02:09:07,606 --> 02:09:08,903
Keep that one.

1506
02:09:09,108 --> 02:09:10,769
Yes, that one too.

1507
02:09:33,365 --> 02:09:35,526
Sign here. Write your name here. Name.

1508
02:09:35,634 --> 02:09:36,999
Come on, hurry up.

1509
02:09:37,536 --> 02:09:38,935
Yes, thank you.

1510
02:09:53,852 --> 02:09:55,877
Careful. Hurry up.

1511
02:09:55,988 --> 02:09:57,683
Quickly, quickly.
- Yes, there.

1512
02:09:58,957 --> 02:10:00,219
Quickly.

1513
02:10:00,292 --> 02:10:02,226
Hurry up.
- Fast.

1514
02:10:50,075 --> 02:10:52,100
Here's your share.
- Madam, a little more.

1515
02:10:52,177 --> 02:10:53,701
Get lost.
- I worked so hard.

1516
02:10:53,779 --> 02:10:55,644
I will break your face.
You were over-acting.

1517
02:10:55,747 --> 02:10:57,044
I was paid less for
the ACP's role as well.

1518
02:10:57,149 --> 02:10:58,912
I'm being paid less here too.
- Get lost.

1519
02:11:05,390 --> 02:11:06,618
Take care.

1520
02:11:16,034 --> 02:11:17,194
We'll meet again soon.

1521
02:11:17,302 --> 02:11:18,633
See you.
- Soon.

1522
02:11:40,993 --> 02:11:42,585
Come here.

1523
02:11:46,398 --> 02:11:47,592
You...

1524
02:11:48,300 --> 02:11:49,528
CBl!

1525
02:11:49,835 --> 02:11:51,302
Oh God!

1526
02:11:52,471 --> 02:11:53,904
Here to conduct a raid?

1527
02:11:55,507 --> 02:11:56,633
Quiet!

1528
02:11:57,175 --> 02:11:59,166
If you're here to
conduct a raid, then go ahead.

1529
02:11:59,511 --> 02:12:00,910
What are you doing inside?

1530
02:12:02,581 --> 02:12:04,446
Waiting for the boss.

1531
02:12:05,050 --> 02:12:06,381
Where's the boss?

1532
02:12:06,985 --> 02:12:09,419
He's on the way.

1533
02:12:09,621 --> 02:12:11,020
Get lost.

1534
02:12:19,498 --> 02:12:20,760
Hurry up.

1535
02:12:21,166 --> 02:12:22,633
How much longer.

1536
02:12:24,803 --> 02:12:26,065
Got it.

1537
02:12:33,578 --> 02:12:34,738
Hello.

1538
02:12:34,813 --> 02:12:36,041
Yes.

1539
02:12:36,481 --> 02:12:37,641
What?

1540
02:12:38,784 --> 02:12:40,149
What are you saying?

1541
02:12:41,987 --> 02:12:43,249
Sir.

1542
02:12:43,355 --> 02:12:44,652
Sir.

1543
02:12:44,756 --> 02:12:48,157
Sir, the CBl raided
Magandas's workshop.

1544
02:12:48,694 --> 02:12:50,525
What?
- Yes, sir.

1545
02:12:50,762 --> 02:12:52,252
We just received a call.

1546
02:12:55,734 --> 02:12:57,861
CBl?
- Yes, sir.

1547
02:12:59,638 --> 02:13:01,902
The workshop?
- Yes, sir.

1548
02:13:21,626 --> 02:13:23,491
'He was humiliated.'

1549
02:13:23,996 --> 02:13:26,487
'He conducted an investigation...'

1550
02:13:26,698 --> 02:13:28,427
'... and gathered this information.'

1551
02:13:28,500 --> 02:13:30,627
'Why is he standing? Let him sit.'

1552
02:13:30,702 --> 02:13:32,567
'No, sir. I am fine.
- Come on.'

1553
02:13:33,872 --> 02:13:36,136
'They made a fool of you, Ranveer.'

1554
02:13:36,208 --> 02:13:38,836
'l came here because
I needed your help.'

1555
02:13:39,011 --> 02:13:41,809
'lf you help me, this
case will be solved faster.'

1556
02:13:42,581 --> 02:13:44,811
'I'll have to admit one thing.'

1557
02:13:45,050 --> 02:13:48,577
'There are just four of you,
but you've spread chaos.'

1558
02:13:48,887 --> 02:13:50,684
'Not four.'

1559
02:13:52,257 --> 02:13:55,624
'People like them help us as well.'

1560
02:14:04,536 --> 02:14:06,504
How wonderful.

1561
02:14:08,940 --> 02:14:10,805
Just remembered.

1562
02:14:11,777 --> 02:14:15,770
'Ajju always used to say,
there's no one who can catch him.'

1563
02:14:17,716 --> 02:14:19,741
Solanki, come here.

1564
02:14:20,352 --> 02:14:23,048
Yes, sir.
- How many people in our team?

1565
02:14:23,488 --> 02:14:27,390
Sir, counting you, me,
Rahul and Ranveer around 27.

1566
02:14:27,859 --> 02:14:30,589
Ranveer isn't a
police officer, Solanki.

1567
02:14:31,063 --> 02:14:33,429
Ranveer was Ajju's aide...

1568
02:14:33,498 --> 02:14:35,762
who came to our office
posing as a police officer.

1569
02:14:35,867 --> 02:14:38,267
And we believed him.

1570
02:14:40,939 --> 02:14:41,997
'Jai Hind.
- Who's this?'

1571
02:14:42,107 --> 02:14:45,565
Ranveer, Shanti, they are all fake.

1572
02:14:46,311 --> 02:14:47,778
You, along with four
junior constables...

1573
02:14:47,846 --> 02:14:49,711
and one female
constable will be enough.

1574
02:14:49,781 --> 02:14:52,301
We'll meet at Safdurjung in 15
minutes. - They were all in this.

1575
02:14:56,855 --> 02:15:00,450
They... they are all fake!

1576
02:15:13,371 --> 02:15:15,236
'Are you sure?
- 100%.'

1577
02:15:17,609 --> 02:15:22,012
We didn't know, but we
were playing for their team.

1578
02:15:27,119 --> 02:15:30,486
We're Special 26, Solanki.

1579
02:15:32,891 --> 02:15:35,587
The rascals didn't
just rob the shop...

1580
02:15:37,062 --> 02:15:39,087
but also the workshop.

1581
02:15:43,268 --> 02:15:44,758
Solanki.

1582
02:15:45,437 --> 02:15:46,734
Yes, sir.

1583
02:15:48,740 --> 02:15:51,334
Where can I find a handful of water?

1584
02:15:52,577 --> 02:15:53,874
What, sir?

1585
02:15:54,779 --> 02:15:56,110
Water.

1586
02:15:57,949 --> 02:15:59,177
Handful of water.

1587
02:16:26,011 --> 02:16:34,011
You'll find me
everywhere I go, I know that.

1588
02:16:38,557 --> 02:16:46,557
I now belong to you, since I know,
that's your influence.

1589
02:16:50,402 --> 02:16:54,463
I close to you, in your feelings.

1590
02:16:54,539 --> 02:16:58,339
In your memories.

1591
02:16:58,710 --> 02:17:06,710
Now you dwell in me.

1592
02:17:07,619 --> 02:17:10,053
Who are you?

1593
02:17:10,555 --> 02:17:14,457
How are we related?

1594
02:17:15,927 --> 02:17:23,231
What's this bond that binds us?

1595
02:17:24,236 --> 02:17:31,836
I can't control myself before you.

1596
02:17:32,577 --> 02:17:35,239
Who are you?

1597
02:17:35,480 --> 02:17:39,712
How are we related?

1598
02:17:56,034 --> 02:17:58,832
We're here. Stop, stop, stop.
- The bus is here.

1599
02:17:59,904 --> 02:18:01,201
Thank you.
- Come, son.

1600
02:18:01,306 --> 02:18:03,001
Thank you. Very good.

1601
02:18:03,642 --> 02:18:05,007
Bye.
- Let's go.

1602
02:18:05,110 --> 02:18:06,941
Bye, dad.
- Go.

1603
02:18:13,151 --> 02:18:14,846
Waseem sir.

1604
02:18:15,120 --> 02:18:16,815
There's a money-order for you.

1605
02:18:16,888 --> 02:18:18,788
Money-order? From where?

1606
02:18:20,258 --> 02:18:23,659
Laxmipur, Bhojpur, District Bihar.

1607
02:18:23,728 --> 02:18:26,219
What? How much?
- 100 rupees.

1608
02:18:26,331 --> 02:18:28,265
And yes, there's a message as well.

1609
02:18:28,333 --> 02:18:29,527
See.

1610
02:18:29,634 --> 02:18:32,467
Waseem sir, I wanted to
return it personally...

1611
02:18:32,537 --> 02:18:34,198
but I am helpless.

1612
02:18:34,773 --> 02:18:38,072
Your hard-earned
money is no use to me.

1613
02:18:38,143 --> 02:18:40,008
Yours, Ajju.

1614
02:18:40,278 --> 02:18:41,575
'It's yours, isn't it?'

1615
02:18:41,946 --> 02:18:43,174
'Yes, it is.'

1616
02:18:43,515 --> 02:18:44,709
'Thank you.'

1617
02:18:45,984 --> 02:18:47,178
Here you go.

1618
02:19:02,567 --> 02:19:04,967
We were about to miss the bus...
- Rahul's called.

1619
02:19:14,346 --> 02:19:17,110
Yes, Rahul.
- Sir, we've information about them.

1620
02:19:34,699 --> 02:19:37,293
Couple of years ago,
maybe three years ago.

1621
02:19:37,369 --> 02:19:39,735
One would have never
associated him with a shot like this.

1622
02:19:39,838 --> 02:19:42,705
But I think he has
come to learn and life..

1623
02:19:42,807 --> 02:19:48,302
...In one day cricket and has
played some really good shots.

1624
02:19:50,248 --> 02:19:51,510
Shot!

1625
02:19:52,817 --> 02:19:54,114
Six!

1626
02:19:59,224 --> 02:20:01,317
Once more, he has to do it.

1627
02:20:20,745 --> 02:20:24,408
In the youth, was on the streets.
Half the world are sinners.

1628
02:20:24,482 --> 02:20:28,816
Who is original, all is a copy.
Whole life is hectic.

1629
02:20:31,856 --> 02:20:35,519
His neck, his legs. His
loin cloth, her veil.

1630
02:20:35,627 --> 02:20:39,188
His finger, his hair, hold
it and get your work done.

1631
02:20:39,297 --> 02:20:42,733
Don't be over confident,
life is catch and hold.

1632
02:20:42,801 --> 02:20:46,396
Catch and hold.

1633
02:20:46,471 --> 02:20:50,237
Catch and hold.

1634
02:20:50,308 --> 02:20:53,835
Catch the thief by his tail.
Everything is related to food.

1635
02:20:53,945 --> 02:20:58,405
Police and thieves, cat and mouse,
whether it is Mumbai, Patna or Delhi.

1636
02:21:01,352 --> 02:21:05,015
Everyone is playing catch.
But money has a good hold.

1637
02:21:05,089 --> 02:21:09,287
The world is an animal,
money leads this animal.

1638
02:21:12,263 --> 02:21:16,029
The money should come any how.
Whether white or black.

1639
02:21:16,100 --> 02:21:19,729
Everyone is running
after this money.

1640
02:21:23,475 --> 02:21:26,933
There is a lot of attitude with
this. If its black then catch it.

1641
02:21:27,011 --> 02:21:29,912
Catch and hold.

1642
02:21:29,981 --> 02:21:33,382
Catch and hold.

1643
02:21:33,485 --> 02:21:37,319
Catch and hold.

1644
02:21:37,388 --> 02:21:40,915
Youth is stuck in
the yes or no of love.

1645
02:21:40,992 --> 02:21:43,722
If she says yes,
then movie and coffee.

1646
02:21:43,795 --> 02:21:45,729
If she says no, then sister,
forgive me.

1647
02:21:48,366 --> 02:21:52,029
The world comes in between,
but love continues.

1648
02:21:52,136 --> 02:21:56,869
Whether you have sense or no,
still it continues.

1649
02:21:59,544 --> 02:22:03,105
Catch the one on the way.

1650
02:22:03,181 --> 02:22:06,878
Catch and hold.

1651
02:22:06,951 --> 02:22:10,352
Catch and hold.

1652
02:22:10,421 --> 02:22:14,255
Catch and hold.

1653
02:22:14,325 --> 02:22:17,920
Catch and hold.

1654
02:22:17,996 --> 02:22:22,365
Catch and hold.

1655
02:22:23,535 --> 02:22:24,797
Catch and hold.
