338
00:24:51,942 --> 00:24:54,110
<b>So he gets the money back
if he divorces.</b>

339
00:24:58,490 --> 00:24:59,450
<b>Love is beautiful!</b>

340
00:25:02,495 --> 00:25:04,538
<b>Let's recap...</b>

341
00:25:06,916 --> 00:25:09,210
<b>Be seen everywhere with this man:</b>

342
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:13,005
<b>Convince those watching you
that you're a real couple.</b>

343
00:25:14,423 --> 00:25:15,424
<b>Yes?</b>

344
00:25:16,677 --> 00:25:18,052
<b>Right away.</b>

345
00:25:18,803 --> 00:25:19,972
<b>He's here.</b>

346
00:25:20,972 --> 00:25:21,932
<b>I'll leave you.</b>

347
00:25:27,437 --> 00:25:29,398
<b>Sorry, darling. I'm a bit late.</b>

348
00:25:29,648 --> 00:25:31,442
<b>I'm so happy to see you.</b>

349
00:25:32,734 --> 00:25:34,528
<b>It's all done,
money's been transferred.</b>

350
00:25:34,778 --> 00:25:37,282
<b>An accounting headache,
but I'll skip that.</b>

351
00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:40,742
<b>Let's chitchat.
How's the divorce coming along?</b>

352
00:25:42,119 --> 00:25:44,789
<b>Elena, be nice to me.
Things aren't easy.</b>

353
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:46,624
<b>Because of your wife?</b>

354
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:49,002
<b>No, because of you.</b>

355
00:25:49,252 --> 00:25:51,880
<b>I feel guilty
about what you're going through.</b>

356
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:56,134
<b>Living with that pathetic guy
must be dreadful.</b>

357
00:25:56,968 --> 00:25:59,053
<b>Not really. In fact, it's quite fun.</b>

358
00:25:59,345 --> 00:26:02,308
<b>The apartment is barely livable,
but the guy is cute.</b>

359
00:26:02,558 --> 00:26:05,352
<b>Cute? Are we talking
about the same guy?</b>

360
00:26:05,769 --> 00:26:07,897
<b>He has lovely eyes,
and he makes me laugh.</b>

361
00:26:08,397 --> 00:26:11,483
<b>It's sweet of you
to try and reassure me,</b>

362
00:26:11,734 --> 00:26:14,821
<b>but it's hard on you.
Thank you for playing along.</b>

363
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:17,657
<b>You know me.
I can't be with two men at once.</b>

364
00:26:17,908 --> 00:26:18,658
<b>That's not funny.</b>

365
00:26:18,908 --> 00:26:21,828
<b>You made me live with another man.
I do my best.</b>

366
00:26:22,078 --> 00:26:24,039
<b>Cooking, the dishes, the laundry...</b>

367
00:26:24,331 --> 00:26:24,998
<b>Not funny!</b>

368
00:26:25,332 --> 00:26:27,542
<b>Your lawyer said
we must be seen together,</b>

369
00:26:27,792 --> 00:26:30,545
<b>and look like a real couple.</b>

370
00:26:30,837 --> 00:26:33,465
<b>I love you.
Soon we'll be together forever.</b>

371
00:26:33,965 --> 00:26:37,470
<b>Gotta go. I can't keep him waiting,
we have a lunch date.</b>

372
00:26:46,229 --> 00:26:49,106
<b>Don't sulk.
I kicked you out because I was low.</b>

373
00:26:49,315 --> 00:26:51,527
<b>Miss me?
See, you're alone like a dog!</b>

374
00:26:51,901 --> 00:26:52,985
<b>I'm not alone.</b>

375
00:26:53,236 --> 00:26:56,740
<b>Sure! The neighbors complain
of your all night parties,</b>

376
00:26:56,989 --> 00:26:59,283
<b>and chicks shrieking in ecstasy.</b>

377
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:08,209
<b>Don't park it, I'll be fast.
Is Francois here?</b>

378
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:10,504
<b>Francois?</b>

379
00:27:30,108 --> 00:27:31,359
<b>Hi, honey!</b>

380
00:27:33,779 --> 00:27:35,029
<b>Is our lunch on?</b>

381
00:27:35,406 --> 00:27:37,365
<b>No, I'm busy, stop by later.</b>

382
00:27:51,714 --> 00:27:53,424
<b>Thanks. Bye.</b>

383
00:28:02,975 --> 00:28:04,144
<b>Bye...</b>

384
00:28:10,442 --> 00:28:12,485
<b>- Friend of yours?
- Yeah.</b>

385
00:28:17,658 --> 00:28:19,326
<b>Known her long?</b>

386
00:28:19,535 --> 00:28:21,662
<b>No. We're living together.</b>

387
00:28:23,998 --> 00:28:26,083
<b>- There were photographers.
- Really?</b>

388
00:28:26,334 --> 00:28:28,461
<b>That's why I kissed you.</b>

389
00:28:29,879 --> 00:28:30,838
<b>What's so funny?</b>

390
00:28:31,088 --> 00:28:32,965
<b>The other valet, you killed him!</b>

391
00:28:33,216 --> 00:28:33,758
<b>Why?</b>

392
00:28:34,008 --> 00:28:35,928
<b>He says I'm hopeless with women.</b>

393
00:28:36,178 --> 00:28:38,346
<b>Why would he say that? He's crazy!</b>

394
00:28:38,555 --> 00:28:41,057
<b>He doesn't believe
in my powers of seduction.</b>

395
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:42,726
<b>I don't either.</b>

396
00:28:45,728 --> 00:28:47,189
<b>Where do you usually lunch?</b>

397
00:28:47,397 --> 00:28:49,066
<b>At Luigi's, an Italian place.</b>

398
00:28:49,358 --> 00:28:52,320
<b>- I keep going straight?
- No, not Luigi's. Elsewhere.</b>

399
00:28:52,570 --> 00:28:55,072
<b>If you're a regular,
let's be seen there.</b>

400
00:28:55,322 --> 00:28:58,368
<b>Not at Luigi's. There's other places.</b>

401
00:29:00,327 --> 00:29:00,995
<b>Is it good?</b>

402
00:29:01,579 --> 00:29:02,872
<b>You read it, Mr Herve.</b>

403
00:29:03,081 --> 00:29:04,790
<b>I did?</b>

404
00:29:05,083 --> 00:29:08,086
<b>You bought it last month
and read it in one go!</b>

405
00:29:08,753 --> 00:29:12,298
<b>I don't recall it!
Yet I still have all my marbles.</b>

406
00:29:12,507 --> 00:29:15,385
<b>Then... give me a lamb chop.</b>

407
00:29:16,887 --> 00:29:20,015
<b>The butcher's next door,
this is the bookstore.</b>

408
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:25,937
<b>This way, Mr Herve.</b>

409
00:29:28,566 --> 00:29:30,526
<b>You could've sold it to him twice.</b>

410
00:29:34,865 --> 00:29:35,657
<b>It's not him.</b>

411
00:29:35,907 --> 00:29:38,034
<b>- He won't come back.
- Just as well!</b>

412
00:29:38,577 --> 00:29:40,162
<b>I had a voice mail from him.</b>

413
00:29:40,412 --> 00:29:42,414
<b>Said he had funds
to cover my debt.</b>

414
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:43,790
<b>Nonsense.</b>

415
00:29:44,624 --> 00:29:46,084
<b>- I didn't call back.
- Good.</b>

416
00:29:46,334 --> 00:29:49,713
<b>He's bluffing.
He can't find that kind of money!</b>

417
00:29:56,012 --> 00:29:57,470
<b>Isn't that amazing?</b>

418
00:29:57,721 --> 00:30:00,766
<b>You can pick another ring tone.
It has 40! For you!</b>

419
00:30:01,184 --> 00:30:02,894
<b>That's sweet, but I can't accept.</b>

420
00:30:03,144 --> 00:30:05,146
<b>Yes, you can!
Look how cool this one is.</b>

421
00:30:05,396 --> 00:30:07,857
<b>- How many functions?
- 100! One's for scuba diving!</b>

422
00:30:08,107 --> 00:30:08,608
<b>Wow!</b>

423
00:30:08,858 --> 00:30:10,902
<b>It's yours. Have lunch with me!</b>

424
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:15,948
<b>OK, but a quick one.</b>

425
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,284
<b>We'll be at Luigi's. I'll be back soon.</b>

426
00:30:18,911 --> 00:30:22,331
<b>No, not Luigi's. Let's go elsewhere.</b>

427
00:30:27,752 --> 00:30:30,881
<b>She's amazing.
Takes guts to kiss a guy like that.</b>

428
00:30:31,131 --> 00:30:33,425
<b>- Yes, she's giving it her all.
- Fuck you!</b>

429
00:30:33,675 --> 00:30:36,470
<b>- Beg your pardon?
- Nothing, I'm sorry.</b>

430
00:30:37,222 --> 00:30:38,180
<b>Yes?</b>

431
00:30:39,057 --> 00:30:42,185
<b>- Don't forget the meeting in Lille.
- Right, Lille.</b>

432
00:30:42,435 --> 00:30:45,855
<b>Being booed by 800 striking workers.
Just what I need!</b>

433
00:30:46,105 --> 00:30:47,857
<b>- When do I leave?
- Helicopter's ready, sir.</b>

434
00:30:48,483 --> 00:30:49,234
<b>I'm off.</b>

435
00:30:49,484 --> 00:30:52,237
<b>Watch them day and night.
Got that?</b>

436
00:30:59,912 --> 00:31:01,412
<b>Everybody's watching us!</b>

437
00:31:01,997 --> 00:31:03,957
<b>Why would you be with me?</b>

438
00:31:04,208 --> 00:31:06,836
<b>Let's up the ante:
Put your arm around me.</b>

439
00:31:07,044 --> 00:31:08,796
<b>I'll rest my head on your shoulder.</b>

440
00:31:09,004 --> 00:31:10,172
<b>Don't, they'll lynch me!</b>

441
00:31:10,422 --> 00:31:11,841
<b>Put down your fork.</b>

442
00:31:13,509 --> 00:31:14,718
<b>See the green Renault?</b>

443
00:31:14,927 --> 00:31:16,762
<b>A guy's taking pictures of us.</b>

444
00:31:18,473 --> 00:31:21,433
<b>Relax! We're supposed to be in love.</b>

445
00:31:23,561 --> 00:31:27,065
<b>It's like when I park a great car:
Perfect, but not mine.</b>

446
00:31:29,651 --> 00:31:30,986
<b>Hurry!</b>

447
00:31:31,862 --> 00:31:33,446
<b>- Let's try this one.
- OK.</b>

448
00:31:36,283 --> 00:31:38,326
<b>- That girl's a supermodel!
- What?</b>

449
00:31:38,577 --> 00:31:41,163
<b>She's everywhere,
she's totally famous.</b>

450
00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:51,591
<b>How are you?</b>

451
00:31:51,841 --> 00:31:53,301
<b>Fine, and you?</b>

452
00:31:53,509 --> 00:31:54,719
<b>OK. You dropped Luigi's?</b>

453
00:31:54,969 --> 00:31:57,806
<b>- I wanted a change.
- Me, too.</b>

454
00:31:58,056 --> 00:32:00,308
<b>- Pascal Bouliveau.
- Francois Pignon.</b>

455
00:32:02,519 --> 00:32:06,398
<b>My kid brother
has your picture on every wall!</b>

456
00:32:06,606 --> 00:32:08,317
<b>- Coming?
- On my way.</b>

457
00:32:08,525 --> 00:32:11,820
<b>If you need a cell phone,
I'll make you a deal.</b>

458
00:32:12,696 --> 00:32:14,448
<b>For you, too. See you.</b>

459
00:32:14,907 --> 00:32:16,116
<b>Enjoy your meal!</b>

460
00:32:20,246 --> 00:32:22,290
<b>Your buddy's doing OK!</b>

461
00:32:23,666 --> 00:32:25,335
<b>Let's hurry, I'm rushed.</b>

462
00:32:25,585 --> 00:32:27,420
<b>- What does he do?
- Parking valet.</b>

463
00:32:27,670 --> 00:32:29,339
<b>He found a nice chassis!</b>

464
00:32:31,591 --> 00:32:32,800
<b>What do you want to eat?</b>

465
00:32:34,010 --> 00:32:36,846
<b>Sorry, I forgot to turn it off.</b>

466
00:32:37,388 --> 00:32:39,224
<b>You can have that ring tone, too.</b>

467
00:32:39,474 --> 00:32:41,017
<b>Two salads!</b>

468
00:32:41,267 --> 00:32:43,479
<b>- Let's look at the menu...
- No!</b>

469
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,814
<b>OK, two salads.</b>

470
00:32:48,484 --> 00:32:50,361
<b>I know you have money problems.</b>

471
00:32:52,196 --> 00:32:55,658
<b>Why did you start a bookstore?
It's a shaky business.</b>

472
00:32:55,908 --> 00:32:57,368
<b>I like books.</b>

473
00:32:57,701 --> 00:32:59,621
<b>Sure, but I'm talking business.</b>

474
00:32:59,871 --> 00:33:01,790
<b>My line is more interesting.</b>

475
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:02,832
<b>Maybe.</b>

476
00:33:03,083 --> 00:33:06,044
<b>Look how many people
walk around with a cell phone.</b>

477
00:33:06,335 --> 00:33:08,672
<b>How many walk around
reading a book?</b>

478
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:13,760
<b>Must we stay glued all the time?</b>

479
00:33:14,010 --> 00:33:15,555
<b>Your friends are watching us.</b>

480
00:33:15,805 --> 00:33:18,223
<b>No, I must go. I got work to do!</b>

481
00:33:18,473 --> 00:33:20,560
<b>Alright then, let's go.</b>

482
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,028
<b>OK, he's gone.</b>

483
00:33:34,198 --> 00:33:35,117
<b>What sign is she?</b>

484
00:33:35,367 --> 00:33:36,952
<b>- Who?
- You.</b>

485
00:33:37,618 --> 00:33:38,703
<b>Why say "She"?</b>

486
00:33:39,037 --> 00:33:39,996
<b>Manner of speech.</b>

487
00:33:40,246 --> 00:33:41,789
<b>Sorry, "she" finds that lame.</b>

488
00:33:42,749 --> 00:33:44,417
<b>And I find you a bit uptight.</b>

489
00:33:44,877 --> 00:33:46,128
<b>- Taurus.
- What?</b>

490
00:33:46,378 --> 00:33:47,545
<b>You asked for my sign!</b>

491
00:33:47,921 --> 00:33:49,882
<b>I figured Sagittarius. Funny, huh?</b>

492
00:33:50,132 --> 00:33:50,924
<b>Hysterical.</b>

493
00:33:51,341 --> 00:33:53,010
<b>- Give me your hand.
- What for?</b>

494
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:54,970
<b>Come on. Just for a second.</b>

495
00:33:58,850 --> 00:34:00,727
<b>What a heart line...</b>

496
00:34:01,477 --> 00:34:02,895
<b>Luck line's good, too...</b>

497
00:34:03,145 --> 00:34:04,814
<b>Cut it out, you're no expert.</b>

498
00:34:05,064 --> 00:34:08,234
<b>If it's fleshy,
it means you're sexy. And you're...</b>

499
00:34:18,494 --> 00:34:19,537
<b>The guy left.</b>

500
00:34:19,787 --> 00:34:21,664
<b>I saw another, over there!</b>

501
00:35:03,918 --> 00:35:05,419
<b>Get to work!</b>

502
00:35:10,132 --> 00:35:14,679
<b>Romeo, spare us your babes
during working hours, it's disrupting.</b>

503
00:35:19,642 --> 00:35:21,603
<b>- You're kidding me, right!
- No.</b>

504
00:35:21,854 --> 00:35:24,021
<b>- That girl? With Pignon?
- Yes.</b>

505
00:35:24,272 --> 00:35:27,025
<b>It's Elena Simonsen,
the best paid supermodel!</b>

506
00:35:27,276 --> 00:35:30,112
<b>Then Pignon's got
the best paid supermodel.</b>

507
00:35:30,487 --> 00:35:32,656
<b>She's crazy!
Why's she with that bozo?</b>

508
00:35:33,282 --> 00:35:34,366
<b>I don't care.</b>

509
00:35:34,616 --> 00:35:36,411
<b>The bastard!
Wants to marry you...</b>

510
00:35:36,661 --> 00:35:38,328
<b>I said, drop it!</b>

511
00:35:40,706 --> 00:35:42,625
<b>Wait, there must be a reason.</b>

512
00:35:42,875 --> 00:35:45,295
<b>Maybe she saw him in a Ferrari,</b>

513
00:35:45,503 --> 00:35:47,714
<b>and doesn't know he's a valet.</b>

514
00:35:48,631 --> 00:35:51,676
<b>No, takes more
than wheels to get her!</b>

515
00:35:51,926 --> 00:35:54,429
<b>Give me a break, drop it!</b>

516
00:35:55,638 --> 00:35:59,184
<b>She can have any man,
and picks Pignon? What's next?</b>

517
00:36:07,818 --> 00:36:10,196
<b><i>It's Mom. About Dad's birthday:</b></i>

518
00:36:10,446 --> 00:36:12,573
<b><i>We'll eat early, around 7PM,</b></i>

519
00:36:12,781 --> 00:36:15,535
<b><i>as the doctor's coming.
He tires fast.</b></i>

520
00:36:15,743 --> 00:36:17,494
<b><i>Big kiss.</b></i>

521
00:36:17,745 --> 00:36:19,164
<b><i>See you Sunday.</b></i>

522
00:36:43,104 --> 00:36:45,190
<b>- Hi!
- There are people opposite.</b>

523
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,652
<b>It's a vacant building.
But I saw a light.</b>

524
00:36:47,902 --> 00:36:49,570
<b>Don't look. We'll seem suspicious.</b>

525
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:51,197
<b>They gonna spy for long?</b>

526
00:36:51,447 --> 00:36:54,117
<b>I hope not.
Pretend we're a normal couple.</b>

527
00:36:54,368 --> 00:36:55,910
<b>What would we be doing?</b>

528
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,788
<b>You watch TV, I'll go in the kitchen.</b>

529
00:36:59,038 --> 00:37:02,501
<b>A guy who comes home to you
and watches TV isn't normal!</b>

530
00:37:06,587 --> 00:37:07,923
<b>- What is it?
- Nothing!</b>

531
00:37:08,172 --> 00:37:11,426
<b>- You were moody all afternoon.
- I'm in a fine mood!</b>

532
00:37:12,010 --> 00:37:13,220
<b>It's the girl at the restaurant.</b>

533
00:37:14,555 --> 00:37:17,516
<b>Your eyes never left her.
Women notice that.</b>

534
00:37:17,766 --> 00:37:20,102
<b>That kiss wasn't
for the photographers.</b>

535
00:37:21,563 --> 00:37:24,857
<b>Sorry if I'm nosey.
Maybe I can help with her.</b>

536
00:37:26,942 --> 00:37:28,777
<b>- Expecting anyone?
- No.</b>

537
00:37:30,655 --> 00:37:32,323
<b>- Who is it?
- Richard.</b>

538
00:37:32,949 --> 00:37:33,783
<b>He works with me.</b>

539
00:37:34,576 --> 00:37:36,412
<b>And thinks you're no Romeo?</b>

540
00:37:43,752 --> 00:37:44,837
<b>Forgot my Play Station.</b>

541
00:37:45,087 --> 00:37:47,464
<b>I'd have brought it to work.</b>

542
00:37:52,344 --> 00:37:53,554
<b>- Is that her?
- Yes.</b>

543
00:37:53,804 --> 00:37:55,347
<b>- You really live with her?
- Sure.</b>

544
00:37:55,598 --> 00:37:56,474
<b>- Why?
- Why what?</b>

545
00:37:56,725 --> 00:37:57,933
<b>Why would she...</b>

546
00:37:58,184 --> 00:37:59,060
<b>Hi!</b>

547
00:37:59,352 --> 00:38:02,022
<b>We met at the restaurant.
Remember? The Porsche.</b>

548
00:38:02,354 --> 00:38:03,773
<b>Introduce us, hon.</b>

549
00:38:04,024 --> 00:38:05,232
<b>Richard...</b>

550
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:06,735
<b>Elena.</b>

551
00:38:07,068 --> 00:38:08,737
<b>A drink, Richard?</b>

552
00:38:10,614 --> 00:38:11,781
<b>How about a beer?</b>

553
00:38:15,494 --> 00:38:16,328
<b>She's not bad.</b>

554
00:38:16,661 --> 00:38:17,704
<b>Quite nice.</b>

555
00:38:19,957 --> 00:38:22,585
<b>Nice? That chick's a knockout!</b>

556
00:38:22,835 --> 00:38:26,297
<b>Don't tell me you're doing her!
Don't tell me!</b>

557
00:38:26,505 --> 00:38:27,172
<b>OK, I won't.</b>

558
00:38:27,422 --> 00:38:30,051
<b>Yes, tell me, dammit!
Tell me you are!</b>

559
00:38:30,301 --> 00:38:32,261
<b>- Calm down.
- Yeah, I gotta.</b>

560
00:38:33,179 --> 00:38:35,223
<b>OK, I'm calming down...</b>

561
00:38:35,723 --> 00:38:38,309
<b>He's doing her!
Bastard's doing her, I know it!</b>

562
00:38:38,519 --> 00:38:40,770
<b>You need a cold shower.</b>

563
00:38:41,187 --> 00:38:43,482
<b>No, I'm OK, I'm fine...</b>

564
00:38:44,733 --> 00:38:45,859
<b>How'd you meet?</b>

565
00:38:46,109 --> 00:38:48,654
<b>On the street.
He was alone and sad.</b>

566
00:38:48,904 --> 00:38:51,657
<b>I never do it, but I went up to him.</b>

567
00:38:52,032 --> 00:38:54,826
<b>Yes. I just said:
"Out for a stroll?"</b>

568
00:38:55,077 --> 00:38:56,870
<b>Not very original.</b>

569
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:58,914
<b>He said: "Don't bug me, lady."</b>

570
00:38:59,624 --> 00:39:00,375
<b>You said that?</b>

571
00:39:02,125 --> 00:39:04,045
<b>OK, what would you have said?</b>

572
00:39:04,295 --> 00:39:05,672
<b>Me? Plenty!</b>

573
00:39:05,922 --> 00:39:07,631
<b>You're a pushover, he isn't.</b>

574
00:39:07,881 --> 00:39:11,052
<b>I took a risk. Right, hon?
But it was worth it.</b>

575
00:39:11,301 --> 00:39:12,762
<b>The bottle opener!</b>

576
00:39:15,890 --> 00:39:17,433
<b>- She's cool.
- Yes.</b>

577
00:39:17,684 --> 00:39:19,602
<b>You told her not to bug you?
You gay?</b>

578
00:39:19,853 --> 00:39:20,980
<b>Get off my back!</b>

579
00:39:21,187 --> 00:39:24,108
<b>I treat women my way,
and I'm doing OK.</b>

580
00:39:24,441 --> 00:39:25,526
<b>Here!</b>

581
00:39:26,277 --> 00:39:28,195
<b>Hope it's cold enough.</b>

582
00:39:28,696 --> 00:39:31,991
<b>No, I'm going home. I gotta go...</b>

583
00:39:32,825 --> 00:39:34,786
<b>You don't have time for a beer?</b>

584
00:39:35,661 --> 00:39:39,206
<b>No, my mom's waiting for me.
I live with her now.</b>

585
00:39:39,749 --> 00:39:40,625
<b>Your Play Station!</b>

586
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:43,085
<b>Oh, yeah... Thanks.</b>

587
00:39:49,217 --> 00:39:51,177
<b>Guess I went overboard.</b>

588
00:39:51,595 --> 00:39:53,346
<b>- That wasn't nice.
- Why not?</b>

589
00:39:53,597 --> 00:39:55,849
<b>That's my life.
You upset it, then split.</b>

590
00:39:56,099 --> 00:39:58,435
<b>I get to pick up the pieces.</b>

591
00:40:01,731 --> 00:40:02,606
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

592
00:40:02,856 --> 00:40:04,441
<b>I shouldn't have agreed to this.</b>

593
00:40:04,691 --> 00:40:06,903
<b>I did it for the money, it was dumb.</b>

594
00:40:09,405 --> 00:40:11,616
<b>Did I upset the girl at Luigi's?</b>

595
00:40:12,868 --> 00:40:15,369
<b>They held hands, so I kissed you.
I blew it!</b>

596
00:40:15,870 --> 00:40:16,871
<b>You love her?</b>

597
00:40:18,789 --> 00:40:19,832
<b>You think it's funny?</b>

598
00:40:20,082 --> 00:40:22,960
<b>I feared you'd be a creep
who pawed me.</b>

599
00:40:23,211 --> 00:40:24,963
<b>You're nice and in love.</b>

600
00:40:25,296 --> 00:40:29,218
<b>I asked her to marry me,
next I'm kissing an impossible thing.</b>

601
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,845
<b>- I'm the impossible thing?
- Yeah...</b>

602
00:40:32,471 --> 00:40:34,056
<b>You're not part of my world.</b>

603
00:40:34,306 --> 00:40:37,768
<b>OK, but I know life.
You didn't blow it.</b>

604
00:40:38,018 --> 00:40:39,311
<b>She was with a guy, too.</b>

605
00:40:39,686 --> 00:40:41,813
<b>- Looked like a jerk.
- He was with her.</b>

606
00:40:42,064 --> 00:40:44,107
<b>Like you and me. She'll call back.</b>

607
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:48,070
<b>She didn't when I said
I had money for her.</b>

608
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:51,366
<b>She's a woman, and saw us together.
She'll call!</b>

609
00:40:56,956 --> 00:40:58,582
<b>Pick it up.</b>

610
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:01,334
<b>Hello?</b>

611
00:41:01,793 --> 00:41:04,338
<b>Foix here.
Sorry to bother you so late.</b>

612
00:41:04,547 --> 00:41:06,589
<b>It's that asshole lawyer.</b>

613
00:41:06,798 --> 00:41:08,759
<b><i>- I'm listening.
- Elena has</b></i>

614
00:41:09,009 --> 00:41:11,804
<b>a runway show tomorrow.
You should attend.</b>

615
00:41:12,054 --> 00:41:14,473
<b>- He wants me at your show tomorrow.
- Why not?</b>

616
00:41:14,723 --> 00:41:15,724
<b>He pisses me off!</b>

617
00:41:15,975 --> 00:41:16,475
<b>OK.</b>

618
00:41:16,725 --> 00:41:18,895
<b>All those photographers
could be useful.</b>

619
00:41:19,145 --> 00:41:20,480
<b>You have proper attire?</b>

620
00:41:20,730 --> 00:41:22,857
<b>I'm not criticizing your clothes,</b>

621
00:41:23,108 --> 00:41:26,151
<b>but elegance will make you
more credible with Elena.</b>

622
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:29,406
<b>We can have clothes delivered,
so you'll look your best.</b>

623
00:41:29,823 --> 00:41:32,701
<b>I'm fine as I am.
Keep your clothes. Bye!</b>

624
00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:35,329
<b>Now he wants to dress me up!</b>

625
00:41:35,537 --> 00:41:36,914
<b>I hung up on him.</b>

626
00:41:37,873 --> 00:41:38,540
<b>Hello!</b>

627
00:41:38,790 --> 00:41:39,457
<b>It's Emilie.</b>

628
00:41:41,043 --> 00:41:42,879
<b>Keep your money,
and don't call again!</b>

629
00:41:44,171 --> 00:41:45,756
<b>Let's meet, we gotta talk.</b>

630
00:41:46,007 --> 00:41:48,009
<b>What's left to talk about?</b>

631
00:41:48,885 --> 00:41:51,345
<b>It's a long story,
I can't explain now...</b>

632
00:41:51,929 --> 00:41:54,390
<b>Don't bother, after what I saw.
Good-bye.</b>

633
00:41:54,724 --> 00:41:56,058
<b>Hello?</b>

634
00:42:00,771 --> 00:42:01,606
<b>She hung up.</b>

635
00:42:02,023 --> 00:42:03,399
<b>She'll call back.</b>

636
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:06,904
<b>She never wants to see me again.</b>

637
00:42:07,154 --> 00:42:10,574
<b>I said she'd call.
Now I say she'll call again.</b>

638
00:42:12,743 --> 00:42:14,328
<b>- You don't have curtains?
- What?</b>

639
00:42:14,536 --> 00:42:16,747
<b>- That's a problem.
- Why?</b>

640
00:42:16,997 --> 00:42:18,666
<b>We'll have to sleep together.</b>

641
00:42:18,917 --> 00:42:21,335
<b>You on the couch,
and me in the bed looks odd.</b>

642
00:42:21,544 --> 00:42:22,545
<b>My bed's tiny.</b>

643
00:42:22,961 --> 00:42:24,714
<b>If you'd bought curtains...</b>

644
00:42:24,923 --> 00:42:27,383
<b>That building was empty.
Curtains cost money!</b>

645
00:42:27,634 --> 00:42:29,928
<b>It'll be a tight squeeze tonight.</b>

646
00:42:47,196 --> 00:42:49,614
<b><i>Levasseur's a liar!</b></i>

647
00:42:49,864 --> 00:42:52,326
<b>You hear them, sir?</b>

648
00:42:52,576 --> 00:42:55,037
<b>They're shouting what we all feel.</b>

649
00:42:55,287 --> 00:42:57,581
<b>Management
broke all its promises,</b>

650
00:42:58,207 --> 00:43:00,042
<b>regarding salaries, lay-offs</b>

651
00:43:00,292 --> 00:43:01,877
<b>or, even worse,</b>

652
00:43:02,086 --> 00:43:04,171
<b>possible outsourcing.</b>

653
00:43:06,006 --> 00:43:10,262
<b>Sorry to interrupt the meeting.
An urgent phone call.</b>

654
00:43:16,811 --> 00:43:17,644
<b>Hello?</b>

655
00:43:18,311 --> 00:43:19,896
<b>I can see them in bed.</b>

656
00:43:20,814 --> 00:43:23,401
<b>Not in the same bed?</b>

657
00:43:23,943 --> 00:43:26,069
<b>Others are watching, so it's better.</b>

658
00:43:28,155 --> 00:43:29,657
<b>Yes, it's better.</b>

659
00:43:30,031 --> 00:43:31,784
<b>- What are they doing?
- Sorry?</b>

660
00:43:32,034 --> 00:43:33,494
<b>In the bed, what are they doing?</b>

661
00:43:33,870 --> 00:43:36,789
<b>Nothing yet, but they just tucked in.</b>

662
00:43:38,458 --> 00:43:39,876
<b>Talk to you later.</b>

663
00:43:49,261 --> 00:43:50,928
<b>Forgive me.</b>

664
00:43:57,644 --> 00:43:59,521
<b>- Where were we?
- Nowhere, sir.</b>

665
00:43:59,938 --> 00:44:04,319
<b>My colleague was frank.
You can tell how disastrous it is.</b>

666
00:44:04,569 --> 00:44:08,823
<b>Closing this factory
will upset hundreds of lives,</b>

667
00:44:09,073 --> 00:44:11,409
<b>a human drama I needn't describe.</b>

668
00:44:11,701 --> 00:44:13,953
<b>Think it over, sir.</b>

669
00:44:15,705 --> 00:44:18,125
<b>I'm thinking...</b>

670
00:44:18,833 --> 00:44:20,919
<b>It's very painful,</b>

671
00:44:22,296 --> 00:44:24,505
<b>a very painful situation.</b>

672
00:44:30,596 --> 00:44:32,264
<b>Is there a subway close by?</b>

673
00:44:32,514 --> 00:44:34,475
<b>- No, why?
- Everything's shaking.</b>

674
00:44:34,683 --> 00:44:36,268
<b>That's just me.</b>

675
00:44:37,102 --> 00:44:38,520
<b>My nerves.</b>

676
00:44:39,146 --> 00:44:41,523
<b>- Where do you usually live?
- On the Left Bank.</b>

677
00:44:41,774 --> 00:44:44,360
<b>- Better than here, I bet.
- It's a nice place.</b>

678
00:44:44,568 --> 00:44:46,237
<b>Can't I come live with you?</b>

679
00:44:46,487 --> 00:44:47,822
<b>I'd rather not.</b>

680
00:44:48,073 --> 00:44:49,865
<b>I won't ask why, you must know.</b>

681
00:44:50,115 --> 00:44:52,077
<b>No one can spy on me there.</b>

682
00:44:52,369 --> 00:44:54,412
<b>- Wouldn't that be better?
- No.</b>

683
00:44:54,663 --> 00:44:57,040
<b>- You like being spied on?
- Yes.</b>

684
00:44:57,457 --> 00:45:00,418
<b>I don't get it.
I haven't since day one.</b>

685
00:45:00,670 --> 00:45:03,214
<b>You must have figured out
a thing or two.</b>

686
00:45:03,464 --> 00:45:05,591
<b>A guy too rich paid me to sleep</b>

687
00:45:05,841 --> 00:45:08,010
<b>with a girl too pretty,
in a bed too small.</b>

688
00:45:08,261 --> 00:45:10,638
<b>We're being spied on,
but I don't know by whom.</b>

689
00:45:10,846 --> 00:45:11,681
<b>The guy too rich.</b>

690
00:45:12,139 --> 00:45:13,266
<b>He can see us now?</b>

691
00:45:13,516 --> 00:45:16,185
<b>His flunky can,
with a camera and binoculars.</b>

692
00:45:17,603 --> 00:45:20,022
<b>Life's complex
for pretty people with dough.</b>

693
00:45:20,482 --> 00:45:23,902
<b>No, it's simple.
Like yours with Emilie:</b>

694
00:45:24,152 --> 00:45:28,073
<b>You're unhappy, she's unhappy,
so's the rich guy and so am I.</b>

695
00:45:28,739 --> 00:45:30,367
<b>How cheerful!</b>

696
00:45:30,617 --> 00:45:32,870
<b>Never fall for a married man.</b>

697
00:45:33,412 --> 00:45:35,747
<b>On that score, I'm safe.</b>

698
00:45:40,377 --> 00:45:41,962
<b>You still love him?</b>

699
00:45:45,216 --> 00:45:46,885
<b>We're quite a pair!</b>

700
00:45:48,302 --> 00:45:50,597
<b>It's late, let's get some sleep.</b>

701
00:45:51,806 --> 00:45:54,183
<b>I want to call her.
But she won't answer.</b>

702
00:45:54,434 --> 00:45:56,102
<b>Yes she will, call her.</b>

703
00:45:56,394 --> 00:45:58,104
<b>Now I know: I'm nothing to her.</b>

704
00:45:58,396 --> 00:46:01,901
<b>She's right, I sleep with a supermodel
to make ends meet.</b>

705
00:46:02,150 --> 00:46:03,151
<b>That's rough.</b>

706
00:46:03,401 --> 00:46:04,736
<b>With you, it's not so bad...</b>

707
00:46:05,154 --> 00:46:07,363
<b>Poor guy! On supermodel duty!</b>

708
00:46:07,531 --> 00:46:08,532
<b>Making fun of me?</b>

709
00:46:08,782 --> 00:46:11,118
<b>Yes. Call her.</b>

710
00:46:11,452 --> 00:46:12,703
<b>I don't dare.</b>

711
00:46:22,005 --> 00:46:23,964
<b>Emilie?
It's Pascal, am I intruding?</b>

712
00:46:24,174 --> 00:46:25,257
<b><i>Know what time it is?</b></i>

713
00:46:25,508 --> 00:46:27,344
<b>Sorry, I'm at the store,
doing the books.</b>

714
00:46:27,594 --> 00:46:29,137
<b>Didn't see the time go by.</b>

715
00:46:29,387 --> 00:46:31,389
<b>I loved our lunch together.</b>

716
00:46:32,389 --> 00:46:33,391
<b><i>- Hello?
- Yes, I'm here.</b></i>

717
00:46:33,642 --> 00:46:35,352
<b>Let's do it again soon.</b>

718
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:37,396
<b>You call me at 11 PM for that?</b>

719
00:46:37,771 --> 00:46:41,441
<b>No, I had a great idea,
and wanted to tell you at once.</b>

720
00:46:41,650 --> 00:46:44,861
<b>Ask your friend
to come by my store with his girl.</b>

721
00:46:45,111 --> 00:46:48,323
<b>We'll take some photos
to put in the window.</b>

722
00:46:48,908 --> 00:46:49,951
<b>Hello?</b>

723
00:46:50,201 --> 00:46:53,329
<b>He's not my friend!
Screw his girl and your window!</b>

724
00:46:53,579 --> 00:46:56,166
<b>I'm sick of all this.
I'm not interested!</b>

725
00:47:17,396 --> 00:47:18,606
<b>Emilie...</b>

726
00:47:19,399 --> 00:47:21,441
<b>It's not Emilie...</b>

727
00:47:22,693 --> 00:47:25,362
<b>- It's not?
- No, it's not.</b>

728
00:47:26,113 --> 00:47:27,532
<b>Oh, it's you.</b>

729
00:47:27,782 --> 00:47:31,076
<b>Sorry about that.
Mind letting go of my breast?</b>

730
00:47:31,452 --> 00:47:32,495
<b>Sorry.</b>

731
00:47:35,623 --> 00:47:38,334
<b>- I was dreaming, I'm sorry.
- No big deal.</b>

732
00:47:38,918 --> 00:47:40,336
<b>She was snuggled against me...</b>

733
00:47:40,546 --> 00:47:42,547
<b>I figured that out.</b>

734
00:47:43,256 --> 00:47:45,593
<b>Her skin was so soft.
But it wasn't hers.</b>

735
00:47:45,843 --> 00:47:49,596
<b>I'm sure hers is soft, too.
Turn around.</b>

736
00:47:50,514 --> 00:47:51,180
<b>Right.</b>

737
00:47:54,435 --> 00:47:56,020
<b>I'm not used to someone in my bed.</b>

738
00:47:56,270 --> 00:47:59,273
<b>My buddy Richard,
a few times before we got the couch.</b>

739
00:47:59,523 --> 00:48:02,401
<b>But it wasn't like sleeping with you.</b>

740
00:48:02,651 --> 00:48:05,487
<b>If it'll calm you down,
pretend I'm him.</b>

741
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:08,700
<b>True, that calms me down fast.</b>

742
00:48:47,658 --> 00:48:49,368
<b>We can't show him that.</b>

743
00:48:50,410 --> 00:48:52,579
<b>You can see he's fondling her breast.</b>

744
00:48:53,205 --> 00:48:53,872
<b>Why?</b>

745
00:48:54,122 --> 00:48:56,417
<b>There's a street lamp
by the window...</b>

746
00:48:56,668 --> 00:48:58,585
<b>No, why'd she let him touch her?</b>

747
00:48:58,961 --> 00:49:00,003
<b>Don't know.</b>

748
00:49:00,254 --> 00:49:02,215
<b>I sat on an old crate all night,</b>

749
00:49:02,423 --> 00:49:05,552
<b>in a crumbling building.
What do I know?</b>

750
00:49:06,135 --> 00:49:09,347
<b>If we show him these pictures,
he'll go ballistic.</b>

751
00:49:09,556 --> 00:49:10,098
<b>Well?</b>

752
00:49:10,765 --> 00:49:13,350
<b>You saw the press coverage, sir?
Fabulous, no?</b>

753
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:16,854
<b>These articles show
that they took the bait.</b>

754
00:49:17,105 --> 00:49:20,817
<b>They all fell for
"The Princess and the Parking Valet".</b>

755
00:49:21,067 --> 00:49:23,070
<b>- The pictures!
- I was getting to that.</b>

756
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:26,156
<b>We have some, but they're
not great... technically.</b>

757
00:49:26,407 --> 00:49:29,159
<b>- You can't see much.
- Not enough light.</b>

758
00:49:33,122 --> 00:49:36,000
<b>I disagree.
These pictures are fine.</b>

759
00:49:36,875 --> 00:49:39,503
<b>Nice work, Paul.</b>

760
00:49:39,754 --> 00:49:40,255
<b>Thanks, sir.</b>

761
00:49:40,505 --> 00:49:42,548
<b>Back to your stake-out.</b>

762
00:49:43,174 --> 00:49:44,259
<b>That little bastard!</b>

763
00:49:45,051 --> 00:49:46,553
<b>Trying to make her!</b>

764
00:49:46,803 --> 00:49:49,764
<b>I'll fix him. He'll be out cold.</b>

765
00:49:50,015 --> 00:49:52,350
<b>You'll make him lose his valet job?</b>

766
00:49:53,435 --> 00:49:56,813
<b>Sir, small fry are tough
to put the screws on.</b>

767
00:49:57,732 --> 00:50:01,026
<b>She's in his bed, he touches her,
for whole nights.</b>

768
00:50:01,985 --> 00:50:03,653
<b>May I speak as a friend?</b>

769
00:50:04,780 --> 00:50:05,697
<b>No.</b>

770
00:50:05,947 --> 00:50:06,616
<b>Alright.</b>

771
00:50:06,866 --> 00:50:08,534
<b>Say what you have to say.</b>

772
00:50:08,743 --> 00:50:11,162
<b>A man like you can't be jealous of him.</b>

773
00:50:11,621 --> 00:50:15,082
<b>You're paid to defend me,
not to judge me. Get out!</b>

774
00:50:22,131 --> 00:50:23,424
<b>Mr Berman.</b>

775
00:50:24,843 --> 00:50:25,343
<b>Well?</b>

776
00:50:25,551 --> 00:50:27,386
<b>You were right, they're not an item.</b>

777
00:50:27,637 --> 00:50:29,598
<b>Even though they slept together.</b>

778
00:50:30,098 --> 00:50:31,141
<b>You have proof?</b>

779
00:50:31,558 --> 00:50:34,436
<b>- Your husband has them watched.
- What?</b>

780
00:50:34,686 --> 00:50:37,397
<b>Another guy
was spying from that building.</b>

781
00:50:37,648 --> 00:50:39,524
<b>He hid, but I recognized him.</b>

782
00:50:40,484 --> 00:50:42,236
<b>No kidding!
He has them watched?</b>

783
00:50:42,569 --> 00:50:44,613
<b>As there are no curtains,</b>

784
00:50:44,821 --> 00:50:46,824
<b>he's like us, he sees it all.</b>

785
00:50:47,075 --> 00:50:48,242
<b>This is too good!</b>

786
00:50:48,492 --> 00:50:51,454
<b>He puts her in the guy's bed,
and now frets.</b>

787
00:50:52,163 --> 00:50:55,166
<b>Wouldn't curtains add to his anxiety?</b>

788
00:50:56,417 --> 00:50:59,546
<b>When you can't see,
your imagination runs wild.</b>

789
00:51:01,005 --> 00:51:05,594
<b>How sad, this poor guy
who can't afford curtains!</b>

790
00:51:09,889 --> 00:51:11,766
<b>- How is he?
- My husband gave him a shot.</b>

791
00:51:12,016 --> 00:51:14,353
<b>- He gives shots now?
- He learned, he had to.</b>

792
00:51:16,188 --> 00:51:17,189
<b>Feeling better, Dad?</b>

793
00:51:17,439 --> 00:51:19,401
<b>- He stuck me like a pig.
- I'm sorry.</b>

794
00:51:19,651 --> 00:51:22,028
<b>I saw the grocer's wife
for her phlebitis.</b>

795
00:51:22,279 --> 00:51:25,239
<b>The shot she gave me was a joy!</b>

796
00:51:25,864 --> 00:51:28,618
<b>- Do you have bronchitis?
- That's right.</b>

797
00:51:28,868 --> 00:51:31,413
<b>- What did I prescribe?
- Suppositories and syrup.</b>

798
00:51:31,663 --> 00:51:33,373
<b>Suppositories?</b>

799
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:35,292
<b>So keep it up.</b>

800
00:51:37,085 --> 00:51:39,254
<b>Coming to Andre's birthday?</b>

801
00:51:39,504 --> 00:51:40,839
<b>I have a ton of work.</b>

802
00:51:41,089 --> 00:51:42,716
<b>Stop by to please Francois.</b>

803
00:51:42,966 --> 00:51:46,136
<b>Move! I have
another patient to see.</b>

804
00:51:57,441 --> 00:51:59,650
<b>- She won't come.
- Why not?</b>

805
00:51:59,901 --> 00:52:00,943
<b>Because she won't.</b>

806
00:52:01,319 --> 00:52:03,946
<b>I hope you're wrong:
He must be so unhappy.</b>

807
00:52:04,196 --> 00:52:07,074
<b>Holed up in his place
with his heartache.</b>

808
00:53:29,412 --> 00:53:30,162
<b>Bravo!</b>

809
00:54:26,513 --> 00:54:28,973
<b>Karl, bravo.</b>

810
00:54:29,224 --> 00:54:30,266
<b>Thank you for coming.</b>

811
00:54:30,516 --> 00:54:32,394
<b>One of your finest collections!</b>

812
00:54:32,644 --> 00:54:35,439
<b>On to the next! I'm never satisfied.</b>

813
00:54:56,086 --> 00:54:57,379
<b>Not too bored?</b>

814
00:54:57,629 --> 00:54:59,464
<b>Why do you all walk like horses?</b>

815
00:55:07,806 --> 00:55:09,558
<b>We did our job, let's go.</b>

816
00:55:12,018 --> 00:55:15,064
<b>You looked magnificent
in that wedding dress!</b>

817
00:55:15,731 --> 00:55:17,441
<b>- Thanks.
- You're very good.</b>

818
00:55:18,569 --> 00:55:19,569
<b>So are you.</b>

819
00:55:19,819 --> 00:55:20,404
<b>Me?</b>

820
00:55:20,778 --> 00:55:24,198
<b>Keep it up, it amuses me no end!</b>

821
00:55:25,241 --> 00:55:27,828
<b>She says I'm good?
Have I parked her car?</b>

822
00:55:29,913 --> 00:55:32,873
<b>I've re-estimated
the cost of your divorce.</b>

823
00:55:33,124 --> 00:55:34,709
<b>It's still rough but...</b>

824
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:35,961
<b>I'm not divorcing.</b>

825
00:55:36,211 --> 00:55:39,923
<b>I thought it over last night
with a cool head:</b>

826
00:55:40,173 --> 00:55:42,467
<b>No woman is worth
losing my life's work.</b>

827
00:55:43,051 --> 00:55:43,678
<b>Bravo.</b>

828
00:55:44,886 --> 00:55:47,222
<b>In business school,</b>

829
00:55:47,515 --> 00:55:50,100
<b>I dreamed of being
the CEO I am now.</b>

830
00:55:50,350 --> 00:55:52,020
<b>Why lose it to a passing fancy?</b>

831
00:55:52,270 --> 00:55:53,396
<b>Bravo again, sir.</b>

832
00:55:53,646 --> 00:55:56,190
<b>Losing my drive,
my pride, my power,</b>

833
00:55:56,399 --> 00:55:58,943
<b>for someone I may soon tire of?</b>

834
00:55:59,193 --> 00:56:00,153
<b>Music to my ears!</b>

835
00:56:00,403 --> 00:56:04,115
<b>After 20 years, leaving my wife
is tearing off a part of myself.</b>

836
00:56:04,407 --> 00:56:06,701
<b>A big part,
she has 60% of the shares.</b>

837
00:56:06,951 --> 00:56:09,705
<b>- That's not what I meant.
- Sure, I'm sorry.</b>

838
00:56:09,955 --> 00:56:12,833
<b>In short, I'll call that girl
to say it's over.</b>

839
00:56:13,542 --> 00:56:15,668
<b>- Does she keep the 20 million?
- Sure.</b>

840
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:19,256
<b>She can keep the money,
it's only honorable.</b>

841
00:56:19,506 --> 00:56:20,758
<b>Yes, of course...</b>

842
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:24,095
<b>I had a trick to get back
most of the sum, but...</b>

843
00:56:26,347 --> 00:56:28,140
<b>That's not what matters.</b>

844
00:56:29,267 --> 00:56:31,018
<b>I'm myself again.</b>

845
00:56:31,268 --> 00:56:32,520
<b>Well done, sir.</b>

846
00:56:32,771 --> 00:56:35,815
<b>To think that I equated
an industrial empire...</b>

847
00:56:36,066 --> 00:56:38,568
<b>with... Elena.</b>

848
00:56:41,488 --> 00:56:42,073
<b>It's Paul.</b>

849
00:56:43,448 --> 00:56:44,282
<b>Yes?</b>

850
00:56:46,201 --> 00:56:46,994
<b>Really?</b>

851
00:56:49,413 --> 00:56:50,706
<b>I'll tell him.</b>

852
00:56:51,499 --> 00:56:52,625
<b>They've put up curtains.</b>

853
00:56:53,042 --> 00:56:53,876
<b>What?</b>

854
00:56:54,585 --> 00:56:56,295
<b>His place has curtains now.</b>

855
00:56:56,837 --> 00:56:57,713
<b>But why?</b>

856
00:56:58,464 --> 00:56:59,258
<b>I don't know.</b>

857
00:56:59,548 --> 00:57:00,466
<b>I knew it!</b>

858
00:57:00,716 --> 00:57:03,470
<b>He's sleeping with her,
hiding behind curtains!</b>

859
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:05,597
<b>No matter, since you're leaving her.</b>

860
00:57:05,806 --> 00:57:08,266
<b>Let's break his legs
with a lead pipe!</b>

861
00:57:08,517 --> 00:57:11,645
<b>We pay him to act decently,
and he reams her ass!</b>

862
00:57:11,895 --> 00:57:13,939
<b>Sir, you came to a decision.</b>

863
00:57:14,189 --> 00:57:16,983
<b>Curtains! So they can hide their smut!</b>

864
00:57:17,234 --> 00:57:19,027
<b>Why the curtains, dammit?</b>

865
00:57:47,765 --> 00:57:48,516
<b>Hello?</b>

866
00:57:49,101 --> 00:57:50,644
<b><i>- Evening. Foix speaking.
- Evening.</b></i>

867
00:57:50,893 --> 00:57:51,437
<b>Things fine?</b>

868
00:57:51,644 --> 00:57:54,189
<b>I just got home,
I liked the fashion show.</b>

869
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:56,275
<b>- You did?
- Ask about the curtains!</b>

870
00:57:56,483 --> 00:57:59,153
<b>It was awesome.
I'd seen that on TV, but...</b>

871
00:57:59,445 --> 00:58:02,531
<b>Sorry to cut in,
but did you do some decorating?</b>

872
00:58:02,781 --> 00:58:03,240
<b><i>What?</b></i>

873
00:58:03,491 --> 00:58:06,535
<b>The curtains. Nice, aren't they?</b>

874
00:58:06,828 --> 00:58:08,037
<b>The little shit!</b>

875
00:58:08,287 --> 00:58:12,249
<b>May I ask why you bought
those curtains?</b>

876
00:58:12,499 --> 00:58:13,584
<b>She bought them.</b>

877
00:58:14,252 --> 00:58:15,462
<b>Elena bought them?</b>

878
00:58:15,712 --> 00:58:17,088
<b><i>I saw them when I got home.</b></i>

879
00:58:17,339 --> 00:58:19,799
<b>- Why did she buy curtains?
- Why did she buy curtains?</b>

880
00:58:20,050 --> 00:58:22,385
<b>To protect our privacy, I guess.</b>

881
00:58:22,719 --> 00:58:24,847
<b>Privacy!
What's the creep saying?</b>

882
00:58:26,056 --> 00:58:29,560
<b>We didn't hire you
to have "privacy" with Elena.</b>

883
00:58:29,810 --> 00:58:32,438
<b>I told you clearly
it was a pretense.</b>

884
00:58:32,647 --> 00:58:33,272
<b>A what?</b>

885
00:58:33,522 --> 00:58:35,900
<b>An act, a game,
you're just a stand-in.</b>

886
00:58:36,150 --> 00:58:39,696
<b>We paid you to pretend
you were a couple, not to be one.</b>

887
00:58:40,446 --> 00:58:41,948
<b>People were watching us.</b>

888
00:58:42,198 --> 00:58:44,159
<b>She was sick of it,
hence the curtains.</b>

889
00:58:44,409 --> 00:58:46,911
<b>We have peace,
they can think what they want.</b>

890
00:58:47,287 --> 00:58:50,873
<b>You're exploiting us, scumbag!
You'll regret it!</b>

891
00:58:51,123 --> 00:58:51,583
<b>Who is this?</b>

892
00:58:51,833 --> 00:58:54,670
<b>I paid you! You thief, you thug!</b>

893
00:58:56,004 --> 00:58:56,922
<b>Hello?</b>

894
00:58:57,965 --> 00:58:59,424
<b>I hung up, sir.</b>

895
00:59:00,592 --> 00:59:01,718
<b>I did it.</b>

896
00:59:05,515 --> 00:59:07,724
<b>Don't lose your temper like that.</b>

897
00:59:08,476 --> 00:59:10,603
<b>Calm down,</b>

898
00:59:10,936 --> 00:59:13,398
<b>analyze the situation coolly.</b>

899
00:59:15,608 --> 00:59:16,693
<b>That guy's sick!</b>

900
00:59:22,782 --> 00:59:25,077
<b>It's 8PM, we're dining
at the Lambert's.</b>

901
00:59:25,327 --> 00:59:27,912
<b>I'll let you go alone,
I don't feel well.</b>

902
00:59:28,162 --> 00:59:28,831
<b>Are you sick?</b>

903
00:59:29,414 --> 00:59:31,667
<b>Tired. I've had some rough days.</b>

904
00:59:31,917 --> 00:59:34,128
<b>Sorry, but I don't feel up to it.</b>

905
00:59:34,419 --> 00:59:35,879
<b>True, you do seem tired.</b>

906
00:59:36,130 --> 00:59:38,465
<b>It takes real stress
to look that way.</b>

907
00:59:39,091 --> 00:59:40,926
<b>Apologize to the Lamberts for me.</b>

908
00:59:41,427 --> 00:59:42,928
<b>Should I cancel?</b>

909
00:59:43,178 --> 00:59:45,432
<b>I can stay
and hear of your troubles.</b>

910
00:59:45,974 --> 00:59:48,767
<b>Forget my troubles,
I'm tired, that's all.</b>

911
00:59:49,018 --> 00:59:51,313
<b>Don't lie,
I know what's upsetting you.</b>

912
00:59:54,316 --> 00:59:55,817
<b>That strike in the factory.</b>

913
00:59:57,527 --> 00:59:59,195
<b>It hasn't made life easier.</b>

914
01:00:00,530 --> 01:00:01,740
<b>I'm so sorry, poor dear.</b>

915
01:00:02,909 --> 01:00:03,993
<b>You'll be late.</b>

916
01:00:04,535 --> 01:00:05,869
<b>Get some rest!</b>

917
01:00:06,786 --> 01:00:08,205
<b>See you later.</b>

918
01:00:16,422 --> 01:00:18,674
<b>A guy insulted me
over your curtains.</b>

919
01:00:18,925 --> 01:00:20,885
<b>Called me a scumbag and a thug.</b>

920
01:00:23,555 --> 01:00:26,433
<b>- If you wanted curtains...
- But I didn't!</b>

921
01:00:26,683 --> 01:00:28,392
<b>- You didn't?
- No!</b>

922
01:00:28,601 --> 01:00:30,062
<b>Then, who?</b>

923
01:00:30,896 --> 01:00:33,315
<b>His wife. Only she would do it.</b>

924
01:00:33,565 --> 01:00:34,858
<b>His wife?</b>

925
01:00:35,275 --> 01:00:36,777
<b>Why'd she fix up my place?</b>

926
01:00:37,069 --> 01:00:38,987
<b>It's their problem. Not yours.</b>

927
01:00:39,237 --> 01:00:42,033
<b>It's my home,
I could file a complaint!</b>

928
01:00:42,825 --> 01:00:43,575
<b>No.</b>

929
01:00:44,284 --> 01:00:47,704
<b>Cops'll say: "What was stolen?"
"No, they hung curtains."</b>

930
01:00:47,955 --> 01:00:48,873
<b>Might turn ugly.</b>

931
01:00:49,415 --> 01:00:50,250
<b>And he called you?</b>

932
01:00:50,500 --> 01:00:54,045
<b>His lawyer did. Then that maniac
insulted me and hung up.</b>

933
01:00:57,131 --> 01:00:58,883
<b>She pulled it off.</b>

934
01:01:00,302 --> 01:01:01,761
<b>I'll be right back.</b>

935
01:01:09,228 --> 01:01:11,688
<b>Give it back.
Emilie won't take it, nor will I.</b>

936
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:14,900
<b>Why? No one's asking
for the money back.</b>

937
01:01:15,150 --> 01:01:16,693
<b>He called me a thief, I'm not.</b>

938
01:01:16,944 --> 01:01:19,071
<b>32,450 Euros is a lot.
He'll want it.</b>

939
01:01:19,780 --> 01:01:22,993
<b>He's a billionaire,
that's a tip for him.</b>

940
01:01:23,325 --> 01:01:25,370
<b>No, he called me a thief!</b>

941
01:01:26,245 --> 01:01:28,163
<b>Give it to Emilie, she'll take it.</b>

942
01:01:28,456 --> 01:01:32,210
<b>It's over with Emilie.
Now she's with Mr Cell Phone.</b>

943
01:01:32,460 --> 01:01:33,545
<b>Francois...</b>

944
01:01:33,795 --> 01:01:35,505
<b>I'm sure she realizes</b>

945
01:01:35,755 --> 01:01:38,174
<b>she's losing a really great guy.</b>

946
01:01:49,227 --> 01:01:50,479
<b>I'm cold.</b>

947
01:01:54,567 --> 01:01:57,612
<b>Take my blanket, I'm not cold at all.</b>

948
01:01:58,571 --> 01:02:01,282
<b>No, I don't need it. Thanks, keep it.</b>

949
01:02:10,416 --> 01:02:11,835
<b>It's because of him?</b>

950
01:02:12,419 --> 01:02:15,172
<b>He's a bastard.
It's wrong to cheat on your wife.</b>

951
01:02:15,422 --> 01:02:18,007
<b>Wait till you're married to say that.</b>

952
01:02:19,426 --> 01:02:21,429
<b>Why am I so cold?</b>

953
01:02:28,435 --> 01:02:32,482
<b>All the men I meet are creeps
with a one-track mind.</b>

954
01:02:41,950 --> 01:02:45,536
<b>If we stay any longer like this,
I'll turn into one, too.</b>

955
01:02:51,376 --> 01:02:54,088
<b>Go back to bed, I feel better.</b>

956
01:03:03,932 --> 01:03:04,890
<b>Thanks.</b>

957
01:03:12,274 --> 01:03:13,650
<b>- What's that?
- Nothing.</b>

958
01:03:14,776 --> 01:03:17,112
<b>You said not to talk about it,
so I won't.</b>

959
01:03:17,779 --> 01:03:19,447
<b>They're getting married.</b>

960
01:03:20,448 --> 01:03:21,324
<b>What?</b>

961
01:03:21,741 --> 01:03:24,703
<b>Their picture's in here,
she's in a wedding dress.</b>

962
01:03:24,953 --> 01:03:27,415
<b>But you're right,
it's their business.</b>

963
01:03:27,665 --> 01:03:30,959
<b>Do the new pens go in the rack
or at the register?</b>

964
01:03:31,210 --> 01:03:34,463
<b>He won't marry her.
I'm the one he loves, he said so.</b>

965
01:03:34,714 --> 01:03:36,882
<b>- Don't bring that up again.
- I didn't.</b>

966
01:03:37,508 --> 01:03:39,719
<b>Never again! Is that clear?</b>

967
01:03:40,636 --> 01:03:43,599
<b>It's for you.
Can we talk? Got a minute?</b>

968
01:03:44,141 --> 01:03:45,600
<b>Go get a coffee.</b>

969
01:03:46,058 --> 01:03:48,936
<b>- Did you hear? Get a coffee!
- OK.</b>

970
01:03:56,861 --> 01:03:57,946
<b>Thanks.</b>

971
01:04:01,199 --> 01:04:01,700
<b>Well?</b>

972
01:04:02,118 --> 01:04:03,118
<b>She's still there.</b>

973
01:04:03,368 --> 01:04:05,747
<b>If she'd pose
for a picture for my window.</b>

974
01:04:06,331 --> 01:04:08,458
<b>Bad timing.
Whatever they're saying,</b>

975
01:04:08,708 --> 01:04:10,167
<b>it's heavy.</b>

976
01:04:10,585 --> 01:04:11,919
<b>Means another lunch alone.</b>

977
01:04:13,379 --> 01:04:14,672
<b>You had a date with her?</b>

978
01:04:14,923 --> 01:04:17,425
<b>She cancels all the time.
She can't like me.</b>

979
01:04:17,675 --> 01:04:18,468
<b>Weird, huh?</b>

980
01:04:18,718 --> 01:04:22,805
<b>Yeah. A handsome guy like you
shouldn't lunch alone.</b>

981
01:04:26,225 --> 01:04:28,394
<b>- What sign is she?
- Who?</b>

982
01:04:28,812 --> 01:04:29,855
<b>You!</b>

983
01:04:30,564 --> 01:04:32,273
<b>Aries, Gemini rising.</b>

984
01:04:32,524 --> 01:04:34,985
<b>That's very good.
Let's see your hand.</b>

985
01:04:39,031 --> 01:04:41,659
<b>- You're very sensual...
- Really?</b>

986
01:04:41,909 --> 01:04:44,412
<b>Being fleshy there means you're hot.</b>

987
01:04:44,913 --> 01:04:46,163
<b>Let's see yours.</b>

988
01:04:50,501 --> 01:04:51,920
<b>I never saw that before.</b>

989
01:04:52,169 --> 01:04:53,505
<b>Me neither.</b>

990
01:04:56,633 --> 01:04:58,134
<b>Wanna have lunch?</b>

991
01:05:03,432 --> 01:05:04,808
<b>There you're lovely...</b>

992
01:05:05,058 --> 01:05:06,310
<b>Great.</b>

993
01:05:07,185 --> 01:05:08,396
<b>Perfect.</b>

994
01:05:08,646 --> 01:05:10,647
<b>Let's do a few more.</b>

995
01:05:12,232 --> 01:05:13,317
<b>Like that.</b>

996
01:05:14,151 --> 01:05:16,237
<b>Let's take a break!</b>

997
01:05:22,034 --> 01:05:23,787
<b>I'm not wild
about the collections this year.</b>

998
01:05:24,037 --> 01:05:27,290
<b>Only the big names
held their own...</b>

999
01:05:27,540 --> 01:05:31,086
<b>The young ones were all
rags and tatters. Diddly poo!</b>

1000
01:05:31,544 --> 01:05:33,422
<b>As for Elena! Seen her guy?</b>

1001
01:05:34,922 --> 01:05:36,049
<b>Look!</b>

1002
01:05:37,467 --> 01:05:40,387
<b>He's a parking valet! Elena, with him?</b>

1003
01:05:40,637 --> 01:05:42,055
<b>He has no money, no looks!</b>

1004
01:05:42,514 --> 01:05:44,100
<b>What does she see in him?</b>

1005
01:05:44,850 --> 01:05:48,563
<b>He must have hidden talents.
That's gotta be it.</b>

1006
01:05:49,438 --> 01:05:50,898
<b>Something huge!</b>

1007
01:05:54,192 --> 01:05:55,819
<b>Things OK, Richard?</b>

1008
01:05:58,489 --> 01:06:00,533
<b>- You OK?
- Sure. When's the wedding?</b>

1009
01:06:00,784 --> 01:06:02,827
<b>That's just fan-mag bullshit.</b>

1010
01:06:03,077 --> 01:06:04,579
<b>- Can I ask you a favor?
- Sure.</b>

1011
01:06:04,787 --> 01:06:06,790
<b>When you're married, don't eat here.</b>

1012
01:06:07,040 --> 01:06:08,626
<b>I'd hate parking your car.</b>

1013
01:06:08,917 --> 01:06:09,792
<b>- Richard...
- What?</b>

1014
01:06:10,044 --> 01:06:12,211
<b>There's nothing between Elena and me.</b>

1015
01:06:12,546 --> 01:06:13,254
<b>Sure.</b>

1016
01:06:13,504 --> 01:06:15,841
<b>I can't explain now, but soon I will.</b>

1017
01:06:16,091 --> 01:06:17,717
<b>You'll see, it was no big deal.</b>

1018
01:06:18,052 --> 01:06:19,970
<b>- You're just ashamed.
- Of what?</b>

1019
01:06:20,220 --> 01:06:22,431
<b>Kicking me out
to ball a supermodel.</b>

1020
01:06:22,681 --> 01:06:25,935
<b>Now you're marrying her,
and I'm stuck at my drunken mom's.</b>

1021
01:06:26,226 --> 01:06:28,020
<b>I'm not ashamed or marrying anyone.</b>

1022
01:06:28,229 --> 01:06:29,939
<b>I bet you gave her Emilie's ring.</b>

1023
01:06:30,189 --> 01:06:32,150
<b>You're a dog,
that's why you get laid.</b>

1024
01:06:32,442 --> 01:06:34,027
<b>But you're not happy.</b>

1025
01:06:34,277 --> 01:06:35,487
<b>I'm not getting laid!</b>

1026
01:06:37,781 --> 01:06:39,616
<b>This thing with Elena's a fraud.</b>

1027
01:06:39,866 --> 01:06:41,701
<b>I'm telling you, you're my buddy.</b>

1028
01:06:41,910 --> 01:06:43,536
<b>Soon we'll be living together again.</b>

1029
01:06:45,622 --> 01:06:46,539
<b>You shitting me?</b>

1030
01:06:47,165 --> 01:06:48,793
<b>You have my word.</b>

1031
01:06:51,127 --> 01:06:52,838
<b>You're an ass-face, but I like you.</b>

1032
01:06:55,216 --> 01:06:56,299
<b>Thanks, Francois.</b>

1033
01:07:04,016 --> 01:07:06,227
<b>Don't park it, I'll only be a minute.</b>

1034
01:07:06,435 --> 01:07:07,728
<b>Is Mr. Pignon around?</b>

1035
01:07:08,188 --> 01:07:09,063
<b>Yes, he's here.</b>

1036
01:07:13,234 --> 01:07:14,068
<b>It's for you!</b>

1037
01:07:36,593 --> 01:07:37,135
<b>Bastard!</b>

1038
01:07:37,385 --> 01:07:41,014
<b>She gives me her number,
and I didn't ask for it.</b>

1039
01:07:46,770 --> 01:07:48,522
<b>Casanova, you about through?</b>

1040
01:07:48,771 --> 01:07:49,731
<b>Francois...</b>

1041
01:07:52,443 --> 01:07:53,443
<b>Francois.</b>

1042
01:08:11,004 --> 01:08:12,589
<b>Mrs Levasseur, sir.</b>

1043
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:15,300
<b>Show her in.</b>

1044
01:08:19,220 --> 01:08:20,263
<b>You wanted to see me?</b>

1045
01:08:20,513 --> 01:08:23,141
<b>I haven't been here in ages.</b>

1046
01:08:23,391 --> 01:08:24,976
<b>I walked through the place.</b>

1047
01:08:25,226 --> 01:08:26,978
<b>A landlord's visit!</b>

1048
01:08:27,730 --> 01:08:28,855
<b>That's fine...</b>

1049
01:08:29,189 --> 01:08:31,067
<b>- Know what the gossip is?
- No.</b>

1050
01:08:31,317 --> 01:08:32,944
<b>Your mind's not on the job.</b>

1051
01:08:33,194 --> 01:08:34,402
<b>Screw the gossip.</b>

1052
01:08:35,321 --> 01:08:39,325
<b>And that if you keep it up,
you won't be CEO for long.</b>

1053
01:08:40,076 --> 01:08:41,619
<b>Got nothing funnier?</b>

1054
01:08:43,038 --> 01:08:46,166
<b>I had the curtains
put up at Pignon's.</b>

1055
01:08:50,462 --> 01:08:53,215
<b>Your lies about that photo
are such fun.</b>

1056
01:08:53,464 --> 01:08:55,175
<b>Your bumbling's hilarious.</b>

1057
01:08:55,467 --> 01:08:57,427
<b>I don't follow you.</b>

1058
01:08:57,678 --> 01:08:58,637
<b>Then I'll spell it out.</b>

1059
01:08:59,096 --> 01:09:00,681
<b>If you love that girl, leave me,</b>

1060
01:09:00,931 --> 01:09:03,016
<b>go off with her to Venice,</b>

1061
01:09:03,267 --> 01:09:04,810
<b>I'll file for a divorce.</b>

1062
01:09:05,185 --> 01:09:06,436
<b>What are you talking about?</b>

1063
01:09:06,687 --> 01:09:09,606
<b>A poor sap who wants
both a wife and a mistress.</b>

1064
01:09:09,856 --> 01:09:10,941
<b>It's time to choose.</b>

1065
01:09:11,191 --> 01:09:14,319
<b>Darling, I never planned
to divorce you.</b>

1066
01:09:15,488 --> 01:09:18,741
<b>You've been glum
since she lives with that guy.</b>

1067
01:09:19,032 --> 01:09:22,036
<b>She means nothing to me, it's over.</b>

1068
01:09:22,287 --> 01:09:23,955
<b>I'll go to Venice, but with you!</b>

1069
01:09:24,163 --> 01:09:25,915
<b>Once the Board meeting's over,</b>

1070
01:09:26,165 --> 01:09:29,003
<b>we'll leave on a second honeymoon.</b>

1071
01:09:29,253 --> 01:09:31,880
<b>We had a lovely suite
for our first one.</b>

1072
01:09:32,131 --> 01:09:33,339
<b>Try to book it again.</b>

1073
01:09:33,799 --> 01:09:34,842
<b>I'll get right on it.</b>

1074
01:10:06,792 --> 01:10:08,961
<b><i>I haven't been here in ages.</b></i>

1075
01:10:09,336 --> 01:10:11,255
<b><i>I walked through the place.</b></i>

1076
01:10:11,505 --> 01:10:12,964
<b><i>A landlord's visit!</b></i>

1077
01:10:23,893 --> 01:10:25,269
<b>Francois is marrying a model!</b>

1078
01:10:26,145 --> 01:10:26,812
<b>What?</b>

1079
01:10:27,063 --> 01:10:29,941
<b>I heard it at the beauty parlor.
They saw it in a paper.</b>

1080
01:10:30,191 --> 01:10:32,194
<b>He's marrying a very famous model.</b>

1081
01:10:32,444 --> 01:10:34,696
<b>- What's this?
- They forgot which paper,</b>

1082
01:10:35,154 --> 01:10:39,201
<b>but swore Francois
is marrying Naomi Campbell.</b>

1083
01:10:39,451 --> 01:10:40,452
<b>A name like that...</b>

1084
01:10:40,744 --> 01:10:42,120
<b>He'd have told you...</b>

1085
01:10:42,371 --> 01:10:44,289
<b>Why would Naomi Campbell
marry our kid?</b>

1086
01:10:44,539 --> 01:10:46,833
<b>It's not her, but someone famous...</b>

1087
01:10:47,042 --> 01:10:48,752
<b>I couldn't reach Francois at home.</b>

1088
01:10:49,002 --> 01:10:50,754
<b>But he was heartbroken over Emilie.</b>

1089
01:10:50,964 --> 01:10:52,923
<b>- I don't get it.
- Me, neither.</b>

1090
01:10:53,883 --> 01:10:54,926
<b>It's me!</b>

1091
01:10:57,053 --> 01:10:58,721
<b>Happy birthday, Dad!</b>

1092
01:11:00,473 --> 01:11:02,141
<b>Your hair looks great, Mom.</b>

1093
01:11:03,476 --> 01:11:05,186
<b>Why are you staring at me?</b>

1094
01:11:05,479 --> 01:11:07,356
<b>Are you marrying a model?</b>

1095
01:11:07,564 --> 01:11:09,315
<b>- No way!
- My hairdresser read it.</b>

1096
01:11:09,524 --> 01:11:11,150
<b>It's just fan-mag gossip.</b>

1097
01:11:11,401 --> 01:11:13,194
<b>Open your gift, Dad!</b>

1098
01:11:19,034 --> 01:11:20,160
<b>It's magnificent!</b>

1099
01:11:20,452 --> 01:11:22,037
<b>- You don't have that one?
- No.</b>

1100
01:11:22,288 --> 01:11:23,706
<b>Thanks, Francois.</b>

1101
01:11:23,956 --> 01:11:26,417
<b>My collection's becoming famous.</b>

1102
01:11:26,667 --> 01:11:29,920
<b>I'm invited to a dinner
to talk about my corkscrews!</b>

1103
01:11:30,170 --> 01:11:31,631
<b>That's great, Dad.</b>

1104
01:11:31,964 --> 01:11:33,758
<b>I brought a friend. That OK?</b>

1105
01:11:33,967 --> 01:11:34,925
<b>A friend?</b>

1106
01:11:41,850 --> 01:11:42,600
<b>Hello.</b>

1107
01:11:42,809 --> 01:11:43,311
<b>Elena.</b>

1108
01:11:43,561 --> 01:11:45,146
<b>Happy birthday, sir.</b>

1109
01:11:45,396 --> 01:11:46,271
<b>Can I help?</b>

1110
01:11:46,521 --> 01:11:49,066
<b>No, sit in the other room,
I'll handle it all.</b>

1111
01:11:52,486 --> 01:11:54,237
<b>Our sonny has a secret life.</b>

1112
01:11:54,446 --> 01:11:57,199
<b>Incredible.
Where'd he ever find that?</b>

1113
01:11:58,326 --> 01:12:01,078
<b>- My God, maybe it's Emilie.
- You said she wasn't coming.</b>

1114
01:12:01,287 --> 01:12:03,289
<b>- Hello.
- Hi, sweetheart.</b>

1115
01:12:03,915 --> 01:12:05,416
<b>He calls her "sweetheart"!</b>

1116
01:12:17,054 --> 01:12:19,181
<b>- Happy birthday!
- Thanks Emilie, dear.</b>

1117
01:12:19,473 --> 01:12:20,848
<b>Where's the oldie?</b>

1118
01:12:22,351 --> 01:12:23,852
<b>- Happy birthday.
- Thanks.</b>

1119
01:12:24,102 --> 01:12:27,148
<b>How old are you, around 75?</b>

1120
01:12:32,904 --> 01:12:36,157
<b>I'm 58. That guy's an idiot!</b>

1121
01:12:36,407 --> 01:12:38,076
<b>I'll change doctors.</b>

1122
01:12:38,743 --> 01:12:42,622
<b>What did I say?
He can get all the girls he wants!</b>

1123
01:12:43,040 --> 01:12:46,125
<b>About the 20 million,
I'm canceling the transfer.</b>

1124
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:54,843
<b>I'll never see her again.</b>

1125
01:12:55,094 --> 01:12:57,137
<b>But to hold her one last time...</b>

1126
01:12:57,763 --> 01:13:00,474
<b>I went through that once.</b>

1127
01:13:00,808 --> 01:13:02,476
<b>I got my last time.</b>

1128
01:13:02,685 --> 01:13:05,688
<b>I lied to the girl,
told her what she wanted to hear.</b>

1129
01:13:05,938 --> 01:13:07,648
<b>She came to our date, elated.</b>

1130
01:13:07,898 --> 01:13:10,150
<b>I got a glorious last night with her.</b>

1131
01:13:10,818 --> 01:13:12,070
<b>That's odious.</b>

1132
01:13:12,653 --> 01:13:13,822
<b>I know.</b>

1133
01:13:14,280 --> 01:13:17,867
<b>"Happy birthday to you..."</b>

1134
01:13:40,182 --> 01:13:43,020
<b>- Doctor, may I ask you for something.
- What?</b>

1135
01:13:43,644 --> 01:13:44,562
<b>Your daughter's hand.</b>

1136
01:13:44,937 --> 01:13:46,690
<b>You should ask her.</b>

1137
01:13:47,148 --> 01:13:48,149
<b>I did.</b>

1138
01:13:48,399 --> 01:13:49,442
<b>Did she accept?</b>

1139
01:13:49,775 --> 01:13:50,318
<b>Yes.</b>

1140
01:13:51,068 --> 01:13:52,988
<b>Then why are you pestering me?</b>

1141
01:13:59,911 --> 01:14:00,912
<b>Thanks, Doctor.</b>

1142
01:14:11,507 --> 01:14:14,093
<b>Why's that doctor always angry?</b>

1143
01:14:14,301 --> 01:14:16,471
<b>He's allergic to patients.</b>

1144
01:14:18,014 --> 01:14:18,598
<b>Hello?</b>

1145
01:14:18,890 --> 01:14:21,099
<b>It's me, I have good news for you,</b>

1146
01:14:21,351 --> 01:14:23,019
<b>or rather, good news for us.</b>

1147
01:14:23,269 --> 01:14:23,770
<b>I'm listening.</b>

1148
01:14:23,979 --> 01:14:26,481
<b>No, I want to surprise you.</b>

1149
01:14:26,689 --> 01:14:28,316
<b>Can we meet tomorrow?</b>

1150
01:14:28,566 --> 01:14:30,485
<b>I've got a show,
but I'm free at 5PM.</b>

1151
01:14:30,693 --> 01:14:33,447
<b><i>- Where?
- At the Pavilion, in the Park.</b></i>

1152
01:14:33,780 --> 01:14:35,240
<b>I'll pick you up at five.</b>

1153
01:14:35,491 --> 01:14:38,869
<b>No, let's avoid the press,
meet me in the usual place.</b>

1154
01:14:39,119 --> 01:14:41,455
<b>Do I spend tonight
at his place or mine?</b>

1155
01:14:41,704 --> 01:14:44,166
<b><i>Go home, you're through
with that bum.</b></i>

1156
01:14:44,458 --> 01:14:45,751
<b>See you tomorrow, love.</b>

1157
01:14:47,795 --> 01:14:49,755
<b>Why does he keep insulting me?</b>

1158
01:14:50,005 --> 01:14:51,548
<b>Doesn't matter now.</b>

1159
01:14:52,175 --> 01:14:54,052
<b>I'm happy, Francois.</b>

1160
01:14:54,761 --> 01:14:57,555
<b>Then he can call me a bum
all he wants.</b>

1161
01:15:10,402 --> 01:15:12,195
<b>Time to say good-bye.</b>

1162
01:15:14,407 --> 01:15:15,824
<b>Not coming up for your things?</b>

1163
01:15:16,074 --> 01:15:17,618
<b>I've got stuff at my place.
Tomorrow.</b>

1164
01:15:18,743 --> 01:15:20,829
<b>Well, good night, Elena.</b>

1165
01:15:21,080 --> 01:15:23,082
<b>I didn't think this 3 days ago.</b>

1166
01:15:23,749 --> 01:15:24,333
<b>What?</b>

1167
01:15:24,542 --> 01:15:26,502
<b>That I'd be sad to leave you.</b>

1168
01:15:27,753 --> 01:15:28,672
<b>Me neither.</b>

1169
01:15:33,218 --> 01:15:34,428
<b>Good night, Francois.</b>

1170
01:16:15,179 --> 01:16:16,472
<b>Am I bothering you?</b>

1171
01:16:16,722 --> 01:16:19,558
<b>No, I'm with my mom.
She quit drinking.</b>

1172
01:16:19,933 --> 01:16:20,517
<b>Yeah, when?</b>

1173
01:16:20,768 --> 01:16:22,686
<b>Today. Looks like it's working.</b>

1174
01:16:22,936 --> 01:16:24,605
<b>- You OK, Mom?
- I'm thirsty.</b>

1175
01:16:25,815 --> 01:16:29,693
<b>You can have this apartment:
I'm moving in with Emilie.</b>

1176
01:16:30,278 --> 01:16:31,779
<b>No way! That's so cool!</b>

1177
01:16:32,029 --> 01:16:34,865
<b>Elena there?
She can stay, wouldn't bother me.</b>

1178
01:16:35,115 --> 01:16:36,284
<b>No, she left.</b>

1179
01:16:36,534 --> 01:16:40,246
<b>To live with the man she loves,
and she's very happy.</b>

1180
01:16:40,622 --> 01:16:43,917
<b><i>Darling,
I never planned to divorce you.</b></i>

1181
01:16:44,918 --> 01:16:48,297
<b><i>You've been glum
since she lives with that guy.</b></i>

1182
01:16:48,506 --> 01:16:51,467
<b><i>She means nothing to me, it's over.</b></i>

1183
01:16:51,717 --> 01:16:53,343
<b><i>I'll go to Venice, but with you!</b></i>

1184
01:16:53,593 --> 01:16:55,304
<b><i>Once the Board meeting's over,</b></i>

1185
01:16:55,554 --> 01:16:58,474
<b><i>we'll leave on a second honeymoon.</b></i>

1186
01:17:14,198 --> 01:17:15,158
<b>Here she is.</b>

1187
01:17:45,648 --> 01:17:47,775
<b>- You?
- She's through with you.</b>

1188
01:17:48,359 --> 01:17:49,777
<b>Get out of this car!</b>

1189
01:17:49,986 --> 01:17:52,239
<b>- I have a message for you.
- Screw that!</b>

1190
01:17:52,655 --> 01:17:53,782
<b>Get him out!</b>

1191
01:17:54,033 --> 01:17:55,742
<b>- When do you go to Venice?
- What?</b>

1192
01:17:55,992 --> 01:17:58,454
<b>Hope you get the honeymoon suite.</b>

1193
01:17:58,829 --> 01:18:00,956
<b>No, wait! Take a walk.</b>

1194
01:18:03,292 --> 01:18:05,419
<b>I don't know what you're saying.</b>

1195
01:18:05,753 --> 01:18:07,755
<b>You will, in Venice with your wife.</b>

1196
01:18:09,214 --> 01:18:12,594
<b>I don't know how,
but you stole her, you creep!</b>

1197
01:18:13,094 --> 01:18:15,262
<b>I'm marrying
the girl I love in 3 weeks.</b>

1198
01:18:15,804 --> 01:18:17,807
<b>You can insult me all you want.</b>

1199
01:18:18,058 --> 01:18:20,017
<b>Elena says that, rich as you are,</b>

1200
01:18:20,226 --> 01:18:22,771
<b>you're a poor man!
She's sorry for you!</b>

1201
01:18:24,147 --> 01:18:26,775
<b>She won't get her 20 million,
I had it voided!</b>

1202
01:18:27,025 --> 01:18:29,487
<b>Not a penny, tell her!</b>

1203
01:18:29,903 --> 01:18:33,239
<b>She knew you'd cover yourself.
I'm sorry for you too!</b>

1204
01:18:47,505 --> 01:18:48,589
<b>Pignon!</b>

1205
01:19:01,186 --> 01:19:03,230
<b>Feeling blue? Want a little treat?</b>

1206
01:19:03,480 --> 01:19:04,940
<b>Leave me alone, dammit!</b>
