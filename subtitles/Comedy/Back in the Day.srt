00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:49,763
I can't make it.
I'm uh... taken.

170
00:08:49,797 --> 00:08:50,631
Shut up, skunk.

171
00:08:50,664 --> 00:08:51,999
Like you had a chance.

172
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:53,233
Uck.

173
00:08:53,266 --> 00:08:54,935
So, what're you guys-
what do you boys got

174
00:08:54,968 --> 00:08:56,003
planned for the weekend?

175
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:58,205
Going to Kramer's lake?

176
00:08:58,238 --> 00:09:00,140
That lake has been
closed for years.

177
00:09:00,173 --> 00:09:02,042
Yeah, t, it's called a joke.

178
00:09:02,075 --> 00:09:03,611
Your joke was a joke.

179
00:09:03,644 --> 00:09:04,678
Your sweater is a joke.

180
00:09:04,712 --> 00:09:06,146
Your birth control is a joke.

181
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:07,247
Ok, your hair is a joke.

182
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,716
Your food stamps are a joke.

183
00:09:08,749 --> 00:09:09,917
Oh really?

184
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:11,084
Your watch is fake.

185
00:09:11,118 --> 00:09:12,953
You're like a fake person.

186
00:09:12,986 --> 00:09:15,355
Actually, we don't
have a lot planned.

187
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,625
Besides for the reunion,
and len's having

188
00:09:17,658 --> 00:09:18,826
a litte barbeque tomorrow.

189
00:09:18,859 --> 00:09:20,127
Oh, sweet.

190
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,062
Oh, len.

191
00:09:22,095 --> 00:09:24,064
Do you mind if i
bring my little ones?

192
00:09:24,097 --> 00:09:25,733
No, of course.
The more the merrier.

193
00:09:25,766 --> 00:09:26,867
Awesome.

194
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:30,103
Ok, well I'll see
you guys tomorrow.

195
00:09:30,137 --> 00:09:31,071
Cheers to that.

196
00:09:31,104 --> 00:09:34,074
Good stuff. Cheers to that.

197
00:09:34,107 --> 00:09:35,743
You think you should?
Alright.

198
00:09:35,776 --> 00:09:36,376
Mmm.

199
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,011
Go for it.

200
00:09:38,045 --> 00:09:39,046
Ok.

201
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:41,715
I haven't seen you in a while.

202
00:09:41,749 --> 00:09:44,685
Alright, bye guys.

203
00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:49,056
She's gonna have a
hills have eyes kid.

204
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:51,124
You know Molly is gonna kill me.

205
00:09:51,158 --> 00:09:51,925
Why?

206
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:52,860
Len slept with her
in high school.

207
00:09:52,893 --> 00:09:55,162
So what, everyone slept
with Angie Kramer

208
00:09:55,195 --> 00:09:56,697
back in high school.

209
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:59,232
Not while you were dating
your soon to be wife?

210
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:01,368
Shame.

211
00:10:01,401 --> 00:10:04,271
I didn't sleep with Angie
Kramer in high school.

212
00:10:04,304 --> 00:10:06,940
Did you sleep with
anybody in high school?

213
00:10:06,974 --> 00:10:08,108
Your dad.

214
00:10:08,141 --> 00:10:09,810
What?

215
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:12,145
Alright, my wife
is really gonna kill me.

216
00:10:12,179 --> 00:10:13,080
You're gonna be alright.

217
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:15,182
I'm sure she forgot
all about it by now.

218
00:10:15,215 --> 00:10:17,017
It's been a long time.

219
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:18,886
Brother, you don't know Molly.

220
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:20,153
What about you?

221
00:10:20,187 --> 00:10:23,290
Yeah, I bet you got all sorts
of ass just throwin' themselves

222
00:10:23,323 --> 00:10:24,992
at you out there in Hollywood.

223
00:10:25,025 --> 00:10:27,160
Oh yeah, I'm just dodging pussy.

224
00:10:27,194 --> 00:10:28,962
Come on, give us something man.

225
00:10:28,996 --> 00:10:31,131
Hollywood is like
a pussy pinata.

226
00:10:31,164 --> 00:10:33,166
I don't have any...

227
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,802
There- give us some dirt.
-Come on man.

228
00:10:34,835 --> 00:10:37,237
I kinda hooked up with a
Lakers cheerleader once.

229
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:39,072
Ha!

230
00:10:39,106 --> 00:10:41,008
Jim, how old was she?

231
00:10:43,711 --> 00:10:46,113
I don't know. She was like 22.

232
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:47,047
Wooo.

233
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,116
22, oh I'm impressed.

234
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:51,985
Jim, you have got to start
datin' someone your own age man.

235
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:55,122
You gotta date someone that you
have at least a little bit of

236
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:56,790
something in common with.

237
00:10:56,824 --> 00:10:58,058
Yeah.

238
00:10:58,091 --> 00:10:59,426
Someone who likes that shitty
ass eighties music like you do.

239
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:00,894
I'm trying, alright?

240
00:11:00,928 --> 00:11:02,863
But it doesn't really
exist out there.

241
00:11:02,896 --> 00:11:05,866
You're just not looking
in the right places.

242
00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:07,234
You'll find somebody.

243
00:11:08,869 --> 00:11:10,938
I hope.

244
00:11:10,971 --> 00:11:13,173
Pray to sweet Jesus you do.

245
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:18,846
**

246
00:11:27,154 --> 00:11:28,789
you gotta be kidding me.

247
00:11:31,959 --> 00:11:32,860
Huh?

248
00:11:32,893 --> 00:11:34,027
Get up.

249
00:11:37,464 --> 00:11:39,099
Laurie Miller.

250
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:44,171
Hey.

251
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:51,111
Too long. Too long.

252
00:11:51,144 --> 00:11:52,412
Yeah, a little bit.

253
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:54,414
Too long of a hug. It was weird.

254
00:11:54,447 --> 00:11:56,149
What are the odds of that?

255
00:11:56,183 --> 00:11:58,151
That's some Casablanca
shit right there.

256
00:11:58,185 --> 00:11:59,086
Man, you should've
said something.

257
00:11:59,119 --> 00:12:00,320
Hey, hey, I was going to.

258
00:12:00,353 --> 00:12:02,089
He's here for, what?
4 or 5 days.

259
00:12:02,122 --> 00:12:03,423
I thought there was a very good
chance that they might

260
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:04,925
not bump into each other.

261
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:06,159
Well they bumped.

262
00:12:06,193 --> 00:12:07,527
I just hope they don't bump.

263
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,429
Bump. bump.

264
00:12:10,497 --> 00:12:11,498
Bump.

265
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:14,067
What are you doing home?

266
00:12:14,101 --> 00:12:15,836
The reunion.

267
00:12:15,869 --> 00:12:17,237
What are you doing at the knob?

268
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:19,272
Mark had a business
thing at the back.

269
00:12:19,306 --> 00:12:21,208
Oh. your boyfriend?

270
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:22,943
Fiance.

271
00:12:22,976 --> 00:12:24,211
I'm getting married
next weekend.

272
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:25,445
Didn't len tell you?

273
00:12:26,847 --> 00:12:28,849
Yeah.
no, len told me.

274
00:12:28,882 --> 00:12:32,352
I just, uh, I thought it was
next month for some reason.

275
00:12:32,385 --> 00:12:34,021
Congratulations, that's great.

276
00:12:34,054 --> 00:12:34,754
Thanks.

277
00:12:34,788 --> 00:12:36,223
You're more than
welcome to come.

278
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:37,925
That'd be a little weird.

279
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:40,227
Come on, we dated when
we were like kids.

280
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,129
Kids don't...

281
00:12:42,162 --> 00:12:44,031
Shush!

282
00:12:45,065 --> 00:12:48,035
I see you on
bilboards and buses.

283
00:12:48,068 --> 00:12:49,369
I'm proud of you.

284
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:52,205
You look good.

285
00:12:52,906 --> 00:12:53,874
You look good.

286
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:57,177
I look awesome.

287
00:12:59,479 --> 00:13:01,181
Yes you do.

288
00:13:01,214 --> 00:13:02,415
Wah!

289
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:05,485
Oh, I hate it when you do that.

290
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,089
Hey, how are you?

291
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:09,890
I'm good.

292
00:13:09,923 --> 00:13:11,524
Wait a minute, I know you.
Don't I?

293
00:13:11,558 --> 00:13:13,126
Uhh, I don't know...

294
00:13:15,095 --> 00:13:16,997
Always there.

295
00:13:17,397 --> 00:13:19,066
Where?

296
00:13:19,499 --> 00:13:21,869
All the time.

297
00:13:21,902 --> 00:13:23,536
This is Jim, honey.

298
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:25,472
Hollywood Jim.

299
00:13:25,505 --> 00:13:26,940
That's my nickname now.

300
00:13:26,974 --> 00:13:30,210
Oh man, I remember you.
Of course.

301
00:13:30,243 --> 00:13:33,013
How's the leg been
holding up, partner?

302
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:36,216
Mark lochyear?

303
00:13:40,921 --> 00:13:42,522
Times running out here
in the 4th quarter.

304
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:44,992
The castle knights need a
touchdown desperately

305
00:13:45,025 --> 00:13:47,060
or their season is over.

306
00:13:47,094 --> 00:13:47,861
Here's a snap.

307
00:13:47,895 --> 00:13:49,029
Johsnon looks downfield.

308
00:13:49,062 --> 00:13:49,930
He sees a man.

309
00:13:49,963 --> 00:13:51,965
It's Jim Owens.

310
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:53,233
Caught by Jim Owens.

311
00:13:53,266 --> 00:13:54,968
He is at the 40.

312
00:13:55,002 --> 00:13:56,069
He's at the 30.

313
00:13:56,103 --> 00:13:57,237
Oh, what a block.

314
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:59,406
He might go all the way.

315
00:13:59,439 --> 00:14:01,541
Owens is at the ten.

316
00:14:01,574 --> 00:14:02,642
[Grunt]

317
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:05,578
Ohh, he is rocked by
Mark lochlear

318
00:14:05,612 --> 00:14:06,513
just short of the goal line.

319
00:14:06,546 --> 00:14:08,148
That one has got to hurt.

320
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:09,416
Ow, my leg.

321
00:14:09,449 --> 00:14:12,886
And the castle knights
come up just short.

322
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:16,389
How's the leg, partner?

323
00:14:16,423 --> 00:14:19,159
Haha.

324
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:20,894
I didn't even realize he
was the same guy

325
00:14:20,928 --> 00:14:23,530
until months into dating.

326
00:14:23,563 --> 00:14:26,233
It was a long time ago.
He's grown up.

327
00:14:26,266 --> 00:14:27,434
Yeah, I've grown up.

328
00:14:27,467 --> 00:14:29,236
Hey girl, how you doin' Laurie?

329
00:14:29,269 --> 00:14:31,371
Hey, you guys remember Mark.

330
00:14:31,404 --> 00:14:33,173
-How you doin' Mark?
Hey fellas.

331
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:35,375
Is that skunk?

332
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:38,211
Oh yeah.

333
00:14:38,245 --> 00:14:40,047
That fool has been
drinking since birth.

334
00:14:41,014 --> 00:14:43,083
Say Laurie, do you still
live on south broadview?

335
00:14:43,116 --> 00:14:44,952
Until the real estate agent
here sells our house,

336
00:14:44,985 --> 00:14:46,119
that's where we live.

337
00:14:46,153 --> 00:14:47,654
'Cause that's near
skunk house, and...

338
00:14:47,687 --> 00:14:49,089
We've been drinking
a little bit.

339
00:14:49,122 --> 00:14:51,158
Would you mind taking
his fatass home for us?

340
00:14:51,191 --> 00:14:52,359
Oh sure. Of course.

341
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:53,460
We were just leaving anyway.

342
00:14:53,493 --> 00:14:55,595
Would you put him in our truck?

343
00:14:56,196 --> 00:14:57,931
I've known him since
i was like nine.

344
00:14:57,965 --> 00:14:59,499
First weenie I ever saw.

345
00:14:59,532 --> 00:15:01,168
Oh yuck.

346
00:15:01,201 --> 00:15:03,103
Alright, Laurie.
Great to see you, Mark.

347
00:15:03,136 --> 00:15:04,571
Take care.
-Pleasure.

348
00:15:06,539 --> 00:15:08,241
Something's never change.

349
00:15:09,042 --> 00:15:10,143
Come on, skunk.

350
00:15:10,177 --> 00:15:11,678
I don't need to if
i don't' want to.

351
00:15:14,181 --> 00:15:16,549
Hey, see you around man.

352
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:18,085
Think fast.

353
00:15:19,219 --> 00:15:20,653
Hey bill, how's it going?

354
00:15:20,687 --> 00:15:22,222
Excuse me, honey.

355
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:23,690
Laurie?

356
00:15:23,723 --> 00:15:25,725
Uh, you know, len's having
a little barbeque tomorrow.

357
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:27,594
You guys should stop by.

358
00:15:27,627 --> 00:15:29,496
Don't you mean a
whiffle ball game?

359
00:15:29,529 --> 00:15:32,165
And isn't that for kids.

360
00:15:32,199 --> 00:15:34,201
Yes and yes.

361
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:37,204
What time?

362
00:15:37,237 --> 00:15:38,005
Whenevs.

363
00:15:38,505 --> 00:15:40,007
Whenevs.

364
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,374
Ready?

365
00:15:41,408 --> 00:15:42,575
Bye.

366
00:15:45,678 --> 00:15:46,679
Alright.

367
00:15:49,182 --> 00:15:54,988
**

368
00:16:41,101 --> 00:16:42,102
damnit Freeman.

369
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:44,237
My bad, team.

370
00:16:44,271 --> 00:16:46,173
You're worst at bat.
Terrible.

371
00:16:46,206 --> 00:16:47,440
How can you not
hit a plastic ball?

372
00:16:47,474 --> 00:16:48,741
You're a grown man.

373
00:16:48,775 --> 00:16:50,343
I'm not good with
the slow pitches.

374
00:16:50,377 --> 00:16:52,245
He's really good at pitching.

375
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:54,114
You're a shitfaced redneck.

376
00:16:54,147 --> 00:16:56,183
I won't disagree with you there.

377
00:16:56,216 --> 00:16:57,750
C'mon, the guy
just lost his job.

378
00:16:59,319 --> 00:17:00,820
I don't give a shit.
I'm losing this game.

379
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:02,522
Yes you are, you're losing.

380
00:17:02,555 --> 00:17:03,823
Alright I'm going to take
a piss and grab a beer.

381
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,058
Who wants one?

382
00:17:05,092 --> 00:17:06,426
I do.
-Alright.

383
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:17,137
Hey Carter. Hey

384
00:17:18,238 --> 00:17:19,506
that's not Carter.

385
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:20,740
That's Nixon.

386
00:17:20,773 --> 00:17:22,742
Carter died about five years
ago, but you wouldn't know that

387
00:17:22,775 --> 00:17:24,577
because you never come home.

388
00:17:25,345 --> 00:17:26,546
Looks just like Carter.

389
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:27,614
You came.

390
00:17:27,647 --> 00:17:28,748
I did.

391
00:17:28,781 --> 00:17:31,284
Where's the, uh,
where's the lucky guy?

392
00:17:31,318 --> 00:17:32,219
Oh, he's showing a house.

393
00:17:32,252 --> 00:17:33,386
He'll be here in a bit.

394
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,321
Nice.

395
00:17:34,354 --> 00:17:37,324
How long have you
guys, you know, dated?

396
00:17:39,426 --> 00:17:40,560
A little over a year.

397
00:17:41,594 --> 00:17:43,263
So what about you,
you seeing somebody?

398
00:17:43,296 --> 00:17:44,597
I mean, you are
getting out there?

399
00:17:44,631 --> 00:17:45,832
I'm sorta dating someone.

400
00:17:45,865 --> 00:17:47,167
Sort of?

401
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:47,667
Wow.

402
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:48,835
Sounds intriguing.

403
00:17:48,868 --> 00:17:50,170
What's his name?

404
00:17:50,203 --> 00:17:51,070
Mmm.

405
00:17:53,306 --> 00:17:55,842
Her name is Tiffany.

406
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:57,510
She goes by tificult.

407
00:17:57,544 --> 00:18:02,215
She uh, listens to small
Wayne and she rages.

408
00:18:03,316 --> 00:18:04,884
It's lil' Wayne.

409
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:05,818
Lil?

410
00:18:05,852 --> 00:18:06,586
Lil.

411
00:18:06,619 --> 00:18:08,521
Lil Wayne.

412
00:18:08,555 --> 00:18:09,389
I was close.

413
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:11,324
I mean the same thing.
Small and lil'.

414
00:18:11,358 --> 00:18:13,293
[Laughs]

415
00:18:13,326 --> 00:18:15,562
So what's it like doing
those commericials?

416
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:17,764
It looks like a pretty easy job.

417
00:18:17,797 --> 00:18:19,732
You know, it's easy I guess.

418
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:22,402
It's also a little embarrassing.

419
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:23,470
I went out there to
become an actor,

420
00:18:23,503 --> 00:18:24,871
not an insurance salesman.

421
00:18:24,904 --> 00:18:26,105
Is that why you're back?

422
00:18:26,139 --> 00:18:28,308
Are you having some sort of
midlife crisis and you thought

423
00:18:28,341 --> 00:18:30,243
reliving the glory days
with your boys

424
00:18:30,277 --> 00:18:31,444
was gonna solve everything?

425
00:18:31,478 --> 00:18:33,680
You know what, there's nothing
wrong with coming back and

426
00:18:33,713 --> 00:18:35,682
having some good times
with some old friends.

427
00:18:35,715 --> 00:18:37,584
Hey I didn't say that there was.

428
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:39,619
Then why aren't you and
Clark going to the reunion?

429
00:18:39,652 --> 00:18:42,155
Mark has a bachelor
party that night.

430
00:18:42,189 --> 00:18:44,624
Great, than you can
go with all of us.

431
00:18:44,657 --> 00:18:45,858
Is the whole gang going?

432
00:18:45,892 --> 00:18:47,360
Yeah, everybody's goin'.

433
00:18:47,394 --> 00:18:49,128
We're all goin'.
It's a gaggle of us.

434
00:18:53,266 --> 00:18:55,468
Alright, I'm in.

435
00:18:55,502 --> 00:18:57,437
Really? you're in?

436
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:58,471
I'm in.

437
00:18:58,505 --> 00:19:00,240
You're in. Urine?

438
00:19:00,273 --> 00:19:01,241
No I'm in.

439
00:19:01,274 --> 00:19:02,875
I'm all in.

440
00:19:02,909 --> 00:19:04,511
All the time.

441
00:19:04,544 --> 00:19:05,044
How dare you?

442
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:08,181
[Laughing] I had to.

443
00:19:08,215 --> 00:19:09,148
Jim, Jim.

444
00:19:09,182 --> 00:19:10,850
Hey buddy, we're all
waitin' for you, man.

445
00:19:10,883 --> 00:19:11,751
Hey Laurie.

446
00:19:11,784 --> 00:19:14,721
Laurie is going to
the renuion with us.

447
00:19:14,754 --> 00:19:17,190
That's fantastic, man.

448
00:19:17,224 --> 00:19:18,291
That's so cool.

449
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,361
See ya.

450
00:19:22,329 --> 00:19:23,330
[Screams]

451
00:19:23,363 --> 00:19:24,264
Jerk.

452
00:19:24,297 --> 00:19:26,333
I hate it when you do that.

453
00:19:26,366 --> 00:19:27,367
Hi baby.

454
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,568
I brought you a casserole.

455
00:19:28,601 --> 00:19:31,271
Thank you.
Did you sell the house?

456
00:19:31,304 --> 00:19:33,206
Yes, I did.

457
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,342
Congrats, that's great.

458
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:36,543
How's the barbeque?

459
00:19:36,576 --> 00:19:37,244
Hey you know what sweetie, i
think I'm going to go to the

460
00:19:37,277 --> 00:19:38,711
reunion thing tomorrow night.

461
00:19:38,745 --> 00:19:41,348
What? why?

462
00:19:41,381 --> 00:19:42,582
'Cause Jim's going.

463
00:19:42,615 --> 00:19:44,317
No, I just haven't seen a bunch
of my old friends in awhile.

464
00:19:44,351 --> 00:19:46,219
I think it'll be fun.

465
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:47,754
Aren't you going with
a bunch of strippers

466
00:19:47,787 --> 00:19:49,021
to your bachelor party?

467
00:19:49,055 --> 00:19:51,891
Uh, well I'm not going with the
strippers to the bachelor party,

468
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:53,560
but yes, there's gonna
be strippers there.

469
00:19:53,593 --> 00:19:55,295
C'mon. let's go say hi to
everybody.

470
00:19:57,797 --> 00:19:58,965
Freeman, hold on to the bat.

471
00:19:58,998 --> 00:20:00,867
Damnit. you're going
to kill someone.

472
00:20:01,734 --> 00:20:02,802
Hi Molly.

473
00:20:02,835 --> 00:20:04,471
Laurie!

474
00:20:04,504 --> 00:20:07,574
We were just talking about you.

475
00:20:07,607 --> 00:20:08,675
Hi Mark.

476
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:09,942
Great to see you again.

477
00:20:11,844 --> 00:20:13,246
Out!
-shit!

478
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,514
You're out.

479
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:16,416
Alright that means your ghost
runner stays on third, alright?

480
00:20:16,449 --> 00:20:17,750
You gotta push him in man.

481
00:20:17,784 --> 00:20:19,486
The old push.

482
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:21,321
Pushy push.

483
00:20:21,354 --> 00:20:23,356
Same old Jim.

484
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:24,457
You're up Freeman.

485
00:20:24,491 --> 00:20:25,325
No man, I'm out.

486
00:20:25,358 --> 00:20:26,493
Dude, my knee is jacked.

487
00:20:26,526 --> 00:20:27,727
I've gotta stretch out.

488
00:20:29,362 --> 00:20:30,697
[Grunt]

489
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:32,965
Well I guess that's
forfeit then.

490
00:20:32,999 --> 00:20:34,267
Damn.

491
00:20:34,301 --> 00:20:35,201
I'm gonna kill skunk.

492
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:36,736
Even his dumb ass is
better than Freeman.

493
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:38,705
Where is skunk?

494
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:39,872
I mean I hope he's alright.

495
00:20:39,906 --> 00:20:42,775
Hey Mark, you play?

496
00:20:42,809 --> 00:20:44,977
Uh, I played a
little college ball.

497
00:20:45,011 --> 00:20:48,715
Yes, but did they play with
bucket rules in college?

498
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:49,882
Boom.

499
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:51,984
I don't know, let's find out.

500
00:20:52,519 --> 00:20:53,453
Here we go.

501
00:20:53,486 --> 00:20:54,687
[Laughs]

Hey, Freeman.

You know she's pregant, right?

678
00:29:02,508 --> 00:29:04,944
You know what they say?

679
00:29:04,977 --> 00:29:06,946
You can't get 'em
preganant twice.

680
00:29:08,247 --> 00:29:09,515
Ron Freeman.

681
00:29:10,216 --> 00:29:11,017
Is that what they say?

682
00:29:12,084 --> 00:29:13,152
Get over here and
open up the door.

683
00:29:13,185 --> 00:29:13,886
I'm comin'.

684
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,988
Kids!

685
00:29:17,123 --> 00:29:18,224
Where are my kids?

686
00:29:18,257 --> 00:29:20,026
Kids!?

687
00:29:20,059 --> 00:29:21,560
Hey, you ready for

688
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:23,963
Yes I am.

689
00:29:27,366 --> 00:29:28,434
What's this?

690
00:29:28,467 --> 00:29:30,302
The baby goes in there.

691
00:29:30,336 --> 00:29:33,572
Somebody took the baby.

692
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:35,141
Somebody took- [baby crying]

693
00:29:35,174 --> 00:29:37,243
Oh sorry, we got her right here.

694
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:44,083
Hey jimbo, he's still safe.

695
00:29:44,116 --> 00:29:45,217
Remember at second?

696
00:29:45,251 --> 00:29:46,385
I remember

697
00:29:46,418 --> 00:29:47,954

698
00:29:49,922 --> 00:29:51,023
Sweet car.

699
00:29:53,159 --> 00:29:55,094
Sweet wax job, too.

700
00:29:55,127 --> 00:29:56,462
Night Freeman.

701
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:20,552
Now fart throwin' has
always been a tradition.

702
00:30:20,586 --> 00:30:23,122
So what you want to do son
is you wanna cup it,

703
00:30:23,155 --> 00:30:24,857
[farts] ok?

704
00:30:24,891 --> 00:30:27,526
And then when you catch it,
what you want to do is a thing

705
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:29,896
called the garvin, ok?

706
00:30:34,266 --> 00:30:36,335
When your dad was in
junior high school,

707
00:30:36,368 --> 00:30:42,008
he played basketball with a guy
named Larry garvin.

708
00:30:42,041 --> 00:30:44,243
Now this guy would just
roll the basketball

709
00:30:44,276 --> 00:30:46,979
right off his fingertips, huh?

710
00:30:47,013 --> 00:30:48,280
So cup [farts]

711
00:30:48,314 --> 00:30:50,316
Catch.

712
00:30:50,349 --> 00:30:52,118
Roll.

713
00:30:52,151 --> 00:30:53,319
Right in there.

714
00:30:53,352 --> 00:30:55,154
Put it right in the
old Tom Selleck.

715
00:30:55,187 --> 00:30:57,990
Wham. garvin.
Ya understand?

716
00:30:58,024 --> 00:31:00,326
Land it right there.

717
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:02,228
Right on the old catfish hunter.

718
00:31:02,261 --> 00:31:05,164
Right there on Freddie murcury.

719
00:31:05,197 --> 00:31:08,267
Snap, crackle, garvin.

720
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:10,269
Right there on the
old clip mantle.

721
00:31:10,302 --> 00:31:11,570
Let them smell the
pineapple juice.

722
00:31:14,306 --> 00:31:16,075
There it is.

723
00:31:16,475 --> 00:31:18,110
Now you go play with your face.

724
00:31:18,144 --> 00:31:20,512
You're daddy's gotta get
ready for his reunion.

725
00:31:23,282 --> 00:31:26,018
Len, do you think that
Jim is going to try to mess

726
00:31:26,052 --> 00:31:27,253
things up with Mark and Laurie?

727
00:31:27,286 --> 00:31:28,587
No, no, no, no.

728
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:31,557
He's just having some fun
with his friends, baby.

729
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:33,025
[Engine revving]

730
00:31:33,059 --> 00:31:34,226
He hasn't been home
in a long time.

731
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:35,427
Is that my mustang?

732
00:31:35,461 --> 00:31:36,828
Woo hoo.

733
00:31:40,699 --> 00:31:43,435
Hey what are you doing?

734
00:31:43,469 --> 00:31:45,137
She sounds good.

735
00:31:45,171 --> 00:31:46,338
You've been taking
care of my girl.

736
00:31:46,372 --> 00:31:47,473
No, no, no.

737
00:31:47,506 --> 00:31:49,408
She is my girl and has been ever
since you gave her to me

738
00:31:49,441 --> 00:31:51,577
for my wedding gift.

739
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:53,379
You know, this is great.

740
00:31:53,412 --> 00:31:56,015
I didn't expect to have
this much fun being back.

741
00:31:56,048 --> 00:31:58,550
I went to pizza king
today and had a strong.

742
00:31:58,584 --> 00:32:00,086
Remember the grocery mart?

743
00:32:00,119 --> 00:32:02,221
It's a Bob's gym now.

744
00:32:03,255 --> 00:32:04,490
Who the hell is Bob?

745
00:32:04,523 --> 00:32:05,624
Bob swallows.

746
00:32:05,657 --> 00:32:06,592
I bet he does.

747
00:32:06,625 --> 00:32:07,960
No, no, Bob swallows.

748
00:32:07,994 --> 00:32:09,161
It's the guy who owns the gym.

749
00:32:09,195 --> 00:32:10,329
We went to high school with him.

750
00:32:10,362 --> 00:32:11,363
Oh that's right.

751
00:32:11,397 --> 00:32:12,298
You know, I guess...

752
00:32:12,331 --> 00:32:15,234
I'm surprised that
you remember all that.

753
00:32:15,267 --> 00:32:16,568
I mean, man your
life is so exciting.

754
00:32:16,602 --> 00:32:18,237
You get to go to Lakers games.

755
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:21,173
You get to party with
Lohan and Hilton.

756
00:32:21,207 --> 00:32:24,576
I do not party with
Lohan and Hilton.

757
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:27,479
Hey len, you wouldn't
care if I, uh...

758
00:32:27,513 --> 00:32:30,416
Picked up Laurie in the
old ride, would ya?

759
00:32:33,319 --> 00:32:35,087
What?

760
00:32:35,121 --> 00:32:36,022
Ah Jim.

761
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:40,359
You know that she's getting
married, right?

762
00:32:40,392 --> 00:32:43,629
We are going as friends.

763
00:32:43,662 --> 00:32:44,863
Alright?

764
00:32:44,896 --> 00:32:47,499
I thought it would be cool to
pick her up in my old ride.

765
00:32:47,533 --> 00:32:50,169
Len, I'm an adult.

766
00:32:50,202 --> 00:32:51,370
You sure?

767
00:32:51,403 --> 00:32:52,304
Yeah.

768
00:32:52,338 --> 00:32:54,240
Is that why your fly
is down, Mr. adult?

769
00:32:55,207 --> 00:32:56,708
How did you notice that?

770
00:32:56,742 --> 00:32:57,909
The whole time?

771
00:32:57,943 --> 00:33:01,280
I think I saw it the second
you got out of the car, man.

772
00:33:01,313 --> 00:33:02,581
C'mon, what do you say?

773
00:33:02,614 --> 00:33:04,116
Yeah, go on.
-Alright!

Music's a little loud.

788
00:34:18,224 --> 00:34:20,292
I can't hear you.

789
00:34:21,327 --> 00:34:22,428
Oh no.

00:34:22,461 --> 00:34:24,430
We're meeting them there.

791
00:34:25,397 --> 00:34:27,633
C'mon, I don't want to be late.

792
00:34:27,666 --> 00:34:29,401
Ok.

793

[Singing]

794
00:34:39,778 --> 00:34:41,213
Slow down.

795
00:34:41,247 --> 00:34:43,081
It's faster than I remember.

796
00:34:44,283 --> 00:34:46,185

Oh shit, look who's coming.

You guys, you can't call him
skunk in front of his wife.

810
00:35:23,255 --> 00:35:24,356
Carol hates it.

811
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:25,424
Well what should
we call him then?

812
00:35:25,457 --> 00:35:26,858
By his real name.

813

What is it?

814
00:35:30,362 --> 00:35:30,829

I've been hangin' out with

That shit was in the vote, man.

823

00:44:31,002 --> 00:44:32,704
Me too.

1010
00:44:40,378 --> 00:44:43,214
Oh Ron, yeah, yeah.

1011
00:44:43,248 --> 00:44:47,252
Uh, uh.

1012
00:44:47,285 --> 00:44:48,353
Oh Ron.

1013
00:44:48,386 --> 00:44:50,789
Yeah, yeah.

1014
00:44:53,258 --> 00:44:55,693
[Crying]

1015
00:44:56,261 --> 00:44:58,229
What's wrong?

1016
00:45:00,265 --> 00:45:01,967
You wanna change
positions or something?

1017
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,269
My knees a little banged up but
i could do doggie if you want.

1018
00:45:04,302 --> 00:45:05,270
Is that it?

1019
00:45:08,073 --> 00:45:09,240
No.

1020
00:45:10,375 --> 00:45:13,244
I'm- I'm giving it all I got.

1021
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:18,750
No, I just don't even
know how I got here.

1022
00:45:20,285 --> 00:45:25,490
You were up in the bleachers and
you did like that basic instinct

1023
00:45:25,523 --> 00:45:29,194
move where you open your legs
and show the downstairs...

1024
00:45:29,961 --> 00:45:32,263
I used to be really popular.

1025
00:45:32,297 --> 00:45:34,299
And I was a cheerleader
in high school.

1026
00:45:34,332 --> 00:45:36,267
And I was on top of the world.

1027
00:45:36,301 --> 00:45:40,471
And now I've got three
kids and one on the way.

1028
00:45:40,505 --> 00:45:42,841
Oh fuck, Ron.

1029
00:45:46,978 --> 00:45:48,213
Listen to me.

1030
00:45:49,547 --> 00:45:52,918
I grew this mustache
in third grade.

1031
00:45:54,285 --> 00:45:55,787
Alright?

1032
00:45:55,821 --> 00:45:57,088
I bought beer.

1033
00:45:57,122 --> 00:45:58,123
I bought cigarrettes.

1034
00:45:58,156 --> 00:45:59,290
I bought dip.

1035
00:45:59,324 --> 00:46:03,261
Everyone wanted
to hang with Ron.

1036
00:46:03,294 --> 00:46:05,230
All the girls loved me.

1037
00:46:06,197 --> 00:46:09,334
And then 'bout junior year in
high school,

1038
00:46:09,367 --> 00:46:12,170
every guy could grow a mustache.

1039
00:46:12,203 --> 00:46:13,839
I lost everything.

1040
00:46:13,872 --> 00:46:16,374
Nobody wanted to hang
out with me, alright?

1041
00:46:16,407 --> 00:46:20,946
So things didn't exactly work
out for me either, alright?

1042
00:46:20,979 --> 00:46:22,447
Yeah, but...

1043
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:24,249
I'm a terrible person, Ron

1044
00:46:24,282 --> 00:46:28,486
because I don't even
know who the dad is.

1045
00:46:28,519 --> 00:46:30,255
I don't know.

1046
00:46:30,288 --> 00:46:31,356
Fuck.

1047
00:46:31,389 --> 00:46:34,259
Oh no.
Hey, hey.

1048
00:46:34,292 --> 00:46:35,293
Look at me, alright.

1049
00:46:36,895 --> 00:46:40,932
You are a beautiful person, ok?

1050
00:46:40,966 --> 00:46:42,133
Yeah.

1051
00:46:42,533 --> 00:46:47,172
And if you need help
raisin' that thing, ok?

1052
00:46:47,205 --> 00:46:52,243
If you need anything,
you call me, alright?

1053
00:46:52,277 --> 00:46:54,946
Because I don't
got shit going on.

1054
00:46:56,882 --> 00:46:58,249
Ron Freeman.

1055
00:46:59,350 --> 00:47:01,319
Fuck me, Ron.

1056
00:47:01,352 --> 00:47:03,889
Yeah, Ron.

1057
00:47:05,456 --> 00:47:09,360
A cheerleader.
I'm fucking a cheerleader.

1058
00:47:09,394 --> 00:47:10,461
Yeah, you are.

1059
00:47:10,495 --> 00:47:12,964
The hottest
cheerleader in school.

1060
00:47:12,998 --> 00:47:15,533
You'll give me an "o" Ron.

1061
00:47:15,566 --> 00:47:18,970
Oh my god.

1062
00:47:19,004 --> 00:47:20,906
Oh Ron.

1063
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:36,287
Oh shit, slow down.

1064
00:47:38,423 --> 00:47:39,590
This is embarrassing.

1065
00:47:39,624 --> 00:47:40,658
You driving me home.

1066
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:42,460
This is a first.

1067
00:47:44,129 --> 00:47:45,330
I'll call you a cab.

1068
00:47:45,363 --> 00:47:47,365
I'll call you a cab, cab.

1069
00:47:48,299 --> 00:47:51,502
C'mon, take a
little walk with me.

1070
00:47:51,536 --> 00:47:53,004
I don't think
that's a good idea.

1071
00:47:53,038 --> 00:47:55,240
C'mon. help me sober up a bit.

1072
00:47:55,273 --> 00:47:56,207
Oh shit.

1073
00:47:56,241 --> 00:47:57,575
[Laughs]

1074
00:47:57,608 --> 00:47:59,310
That was the curb, not me.

1075
00:47:59,344 --> 00:48:01,079
Ok, just for a little bit.
It's a good idea.

1076
00:48:03,614 --> 00:48:04,983
You ok? I'm not even...

1077
00:48:05,016 --> 00:48:06,184
[Laughing]

1078
00:48:06,217 --> 00:48:08,086
I'm totally cool.

1079
00:48:08,119 --> 00:48:10,521
Right up there on the
left, Steve tibbles.

1080
00:48:10,555 --> 00:48:12,190
Didn't he kill somebody?

1081
00:48:12,223 --> 00:48:13,658
Yes he did.

1082
00:48:13,691 --> 00:48:15,560
You know what's
funny about that?

1083
00:48:15,593 --> 00:48:18,196
Only friend my mother ever
let spend the night.

1084
00:48:18,229 --> 00:48:20,298
She siad he was a good kid,
came from a good family.

1085
00:48:20,331 --> 00:48:22,367
My mother was not a
good judge of character.

1086
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:23,501
Wait, she liked me.

1087
00:48:23,534 --> 00:48:25,103
Exactly.

1088
00:48:25,303 --> 00:48:28,206
Hey, why'd you decide
to come back now?

1089
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:29,407
What do you mean?

1090
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:30,375
The reunion.

1091
00:48:30,408 --> 00:48:32,110
You don't come back
for like eight years.

1092
00:48:32,143 --> 00:48:33,311
Suddenly you're excited
about things you

1093
00:48:33,344 --> 00:48:35,346
never even noticed before.

1094
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:39,384
You know, maybe I was so focused
on getting out of here, I never-

1095
00:48:39,417 --> 00:48:41,619
I never really gave
this place a chance.

1096
00:48:41,652 --> 00:48:43,088
Maybe what I've always needed

1097
00:48:43,121 --> 00:48:45,323
has been right here in
front of me.

1098
00:48:45,356 --> 00:48:46,357

1099
00:48:46,391 --> 00:48:47,392
Uh.

00:48:47,425 --> 00:48:48,359
Oh my god.

1101
00:48:48,393 --> 00:48:50,962
Oh my god, Jim. Are you ok?

1102
00:48:50,996 --> 00:48:51,662
No.

1103
00:48:53,331 --> 00:48:54,565
Ouch.

1104
00:48:54,599 --> 00:48:56,001
We should get you some ice.

1105
00:48:58,569 --> 00:49:00,371
Maybe it was a sign.

1106
00:49:00,405 --> 00:49:02,340
What?

1107
00:49:02,373 --> 00:49:04,642
The sign that I bumped into.

1108
00:49:04,675 --> 00:49:06,377
Maybe it was a sign.

1109
00:49:06,411 --> 00:49:09,180
[Laughing]

1110
00:49:10,348 --> 00:49:11,749
It was a sign.

1111
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:13,384
A sign that you're drunk and
you need to go home

1112
00:49:13,418 --> 00:49:14,519
and get some sleep.

1113
00:49:14,552 --> 00:49:15,520
I'm not drunk.

1114
00:49:15,553 --> 00:49:17,722
I had like two beers and
some of skunk's urine.

1115
00:49:17,755 --> 00:49:19,257
Ew.

1116
00:49:20,391 --> 00:49:22,693
How's your head?

1117
00:49:22,727 --> 00:49:24,395
It's better.

Ow.

1120
00:49:29,167 --> 00:49:30,035
What was that for?

1121
00:49:30,068 --> 00:49:32,170
Why didn't you ever call me?
You jerk.

1122
00:49:34,172 --> 00:49:36,441
Are you serious, you want
to talk about this now?

1123
00:49:36,474 --> 00:49:37,708
Yeah, I want to
talk about this now.

1124
00:49:37,742 --> 00:49:40,245
I've waited ten year
to talk about this.

1125
00:49:42,147 --> 00:49:46,551
I was- I was young and stupid.

1126
00:49:46,584 --> 00:49:48,653
And i- I didn't know what i
wanted and I didn't think it was

1127
00:49:48,686 --> 00:49:51,322
fair if I kept you hangin' on.

1128
00:49:51,656 --> 00:49:54,692
Well I appreciate you letting
me make my own decisions.

1129
00:49:55,693 --> 00:49:57,328
[Sigh]

1130
00:49:59,264 --> 00:50:02,333
I just- I just got so
caught up with all of it.

1131
00:50:02,367 --> 00:50:04,102
With all of what?

1132
00:50:04,135 --> 00:50:06,204
Becoming somebody.

1133
00:50:06,237 --> 00:50:09,740
I didn't want to come
back until I was.

1134
00:50:10,308 --> 00:50:13,211
You were somebody to me.

1135
00:50:14,245 --> 00:50:16,414
I guess that wasn't enough.

1136
00:50:21,152 --> 00:50:22,620
I'm sorry.

1137
00:50:22,653 --> 00:50:24,422
You'll never know
how sorry I am.

1138
00:50:26,791 --> 00:50:28,426
Did you hear something?

1139
00:50:29,127 --> 00:50:29,627
Laurie?

1140
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:30,528
Shit.

1141
00:50:32,097 --> 00:50:33,231
What's he doing home?

1142
00:50:33,264 --> 00:50:34,299
Doesn't he live here?

1143
00:50:34,332 --> 00:50:37,202
Yes, but tonight was his
bachelor party and he was

1144
00:50:37,235 --> 00:50:39,104
supposed to spend the night
at his friend's house.

1145
00:50:39,137 --> 00:50:40,571
Go hide in the bathroom,
then he'll pass out,

1146
00:50:40,605 --> 00:50:42,140
and then you can go downstairs
and leave.

1147
00:50:42,173 --> 00:50:43,341
Just tell Mark what happened.

1148
00:50:43,374 --> 00:50:44,442
I'm sure he'll understand.

1149
00:50:44,475 --> 00:50:45,443
He's drunk.

1150
00:50:45,476 --> 00:50:46,544
That's not the time to
be honest with anyone.

1151
00:50:46,577 --> 00:50:47,812
Go!

01:09:47,484 --> 01:09:48,285
No.

1503
01:09:51,955 --> 01:09:55,292
You know, I've been wasting
so much time chasing

1504
01:09:55,325 --> 01:09:58,362
after things that I thought
would make me happy,

1505
01:09:59,463 --> 01:10:01,565
but the only thing that's ever
really made me happy

1506
01:10:01,598 --> 01:10:02,566
was you.

1507
01:10:03,500 --> 01:10:04,734
Alright?

1508
01:10:04,768 --> 01:10:07,904
I didn't come here to break up
your wedding or win you back.

1509
01:10:08,738 --> 01:10:10,774
Then I see you.

1510
01:10:10,807 --> 01:10:12,442
You still look the same.

1511
01:10:12,476 --> 01:10:18,715
And you smile, and i
realize, I really am at home.

1512
01:10:20,484 --> 01:10:22,319
It's so sweet.

1513
01:10:22,352 --> 01:10:22,886
Shh.

1514
01:10:22,919 --> 01:10:24,854
Why are you doing this?

1515
01:10:26,323 --> 01:10:28,325
Yeah, Jim why are
you doing this?

1516
01:10:28,358 --> 01:10:30,360
Molly, can you please
stay out of this.

1517
01:10:30,994 --> 01:10:33,963
I'm sorry, I'm sorry ladies.

1518
01:10:33,997 --> 01:10:35,899
I'm just really confused.

1519
01:10:36,766 --> 01:10:38,568
Hey Laurie, wait!

1520
01:10:38,602 --> 01:10:41,805
I don't know what kind of life
you life out there

1521
01:10:41,838 --> 01:10:45,642
but that kind of crap
doesn't fly out here.

1522
01:10:48,945 --> 01:10:50,514
It's ok Carol.

1523
01:10:57,354 --> 01:10:58,455
She still has feelings
for me, skunk.

1524
01:10:58,488 --> 01:10:59,589
I know it.

1525
01:10:59,623 --> 01:11:01,024
Maybe I've been wasting my time
out there on something

1526
01:11:01,057 --> 01:11:02,526
that's never gonna happen.

1527
01:11:02,559 --> 01:11:04,428
Can I saw something to you Jim?

1528
01:11:05,595 --> 01:11:06,996
Do I have a choice?

1529
01:11:07,030 --> 01:11:09,333
You don't belong here.

1530
01:11:10,700 --> 01:11:12,502
Well thank you.

1531
01:11:12,536 --> 01:11:14,904
No, I don't mean
that in a bad way.

1532
01:11:14,938 --> 01:11:19,909
It's just uh, you're
different son.

1533
01:11:21,811 --> 01:11:24,013
You were always the
center of attention.

1534
01:11:24,047 --> 01:11:28,652
You were always trying to be
the best of everything you did.

1535
01:11:28,685 --> 01:11:31,655
You actually got
out of newburgh, ok?

1536
01:11:31,688 --> 01:11:35,559
You got out of newburgh, and
you found a new bigger, better

1537
01:11:35,592 --> 01:11:37,427
burgh- er.

1538
01:11:37,461 --> 01:11:39,829
A juicier new burgh.

1539
01:11:39,863 --> 01:11:45,602
You ran away from here so you
could become something there.

1540
01:11:45,635 --> 01:11:50,807
But now you're running away from
there to become something here?

1541
01:11:50,840 --> 01:11:54,411
It just doesn't
make sense, Jim, ok?

1542
01:11:54,444 --> 01:11:56,846
Sometimes you just gotta grab
that rear view mirror and

1543
01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:58,915
rip it the fuck off.

1544
01:11:58,948 --> 01:12:01,685
And never look back man.

1545
01:12:01,918 --> 01:12:02,919
[Sigh]

1546
01:12:06,656 --> 01:12:10,860
I can't believe I'm actually
getting advice from you, skunk.

1547
01:12:10,894 --> 01:12:13,096
Yeah, well I can't believe we
have a black president.

1548
01:12:13,129 --> 01:12:16,433
But I turn on my TV and there
he is. He's black.

1549
01:12:16,466 --> 01:12:17,634
That's a little racist.

1550
01:12:17,667 --> 01:12:18,535
No it's not.

1551
01:12:18,568 --> 01:12:19,603
My best friend's black.

1552
01:12:19,636 --> 01:12:20,604
T.

1553
01:12:20,637 --> 01:12:22,739
Yeah, I know him.

1554
01:12:22,772 --> 01:12:25,409
Jim, I want you to know
that I'm not always

1555
01:12:25,442 --> 01:12:27,577
this much of a screw up, ok?

1556
01:12:27,611 --> 01:12:28,712
If you ever need anything,

1557
01:12:30,580 --> 01:12:32,015
you can count on me.

1558
01:12:33,182 --> 01:12:35,419
Anything at all.

1559
01:12:35,852 --> 01:12:40,056
You just want to come out to
California and party with me,

1560
01:12:40,089 --> 01:12:41,458
don't ya?

1561
01:12:41,491 --> 01:12:42,492
[Laughing]

1562
01:12:42,526 --> 01:12:44,661
I would like to roll around
with some of them

1563
01:12:44,694 --> 01:12:47,497
Victoria secret angels.

1564
01:12:48,498 --> 01:12:49,499
I bet you would.

1565
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:54,538
But, honestly, if you ever need
anything from me,

1566
01:12:54,571 --> 01:12:56,506
you consider it done.

1567
01:12:56,540 --> 01:12:58,408
Well, if you can get
rid of Mark...

1568
01:12:58,442 --> 01:13:01,511
And get Laurie to marry me in
say the next 24 hours,

1569
01:13:01,545 --> 01:13:03,513
that would be great.

1570
01:13:05,014 --> 01:13:07,784
Alright, I gotta a
lot to think about.

1571
01:13:08,552 --> 01:13:10,086
I don't care wht teagely said.

1572
01:13:10,119 --> 01:13:12,021
You are not mentally challenged.

1573
01:13:14,223 --> 01:13:15,492
[Fart]

1574
01:13:15,525 --> 01:13:16,993
Huh?

1575
01:13:21,565 --> 01:13:26,503
**

1576
01:14:02,572 --> 01:14:04,708
take a deep breath.

1577
01:14:05,675 --> 01:14:07,477
You look beautiful.

1578
01:14:08,745 --> 01:14:09,879
Laurie?

1579
01:14:16,052 --> 01:14:17,487
I'll be right back.

1580
01:14:19,523 --> 01:14:20,456
Hi Jim.

1581
01:14:24,628 --> 01:14:26,863
Listen, about yesterday-

1582
01:14:26,896 --> 01:14:28,031
he's late.

1583
01:14:29,633 --> 01:14:31,568
He's never late for anything.

1584
01:14:31,601 --> 01:14:32,669
What happened?

1585
01:14:37,173 --> 01:14:39,643
I told him that you came
over and he asked me

1586
01:14:39,676 --> 01:14:41,678
if I still had feelings for you.

1587
01:14:42,546 --> 01:14:43,847
And I said of course.

1588
01:14:45,314 --> 01:14:47,751
I've known you since
we were like kids.

1589
01:14:47,784 --> 01:14:49,553
You were my first love.

1590
01:14:51,688 --> 01:14:54,123
But that I love him.

1591
01:14:54,157 --> 01:14:55,859
I want to marry him.

1592
01:14:59,095 --> 01:15:02,198
I thought everything was fine
this morning, but

1593
01:15:02,231 --> 01:15:05,168
now he's gone and nobody
know's where he is.

1594
01:15:06,603 --> 01:15:08,504
I just hope he didn't
have second thoughts.

1595
01:15:29,593 --> 01:15:31,194
This is all my fault.

1596
01:15:33,196 --> 01:15:34,664
Skunk was right.

1597
01:15:34,698 --> 01:15:36,265
What are you talking about?

1598
01:15:39,669 --> 01:15:42,038
What I'm trying to say
is who the hell am I to

1599
01:15:42,071 --> 01:15:44,708
come back here and screw up
everybody lse's lives

1600
01:15:44,741 --> 01:15:46,810
because I haven't figured out
mine yet?

1601
01:15:49,646 --> 01:15:50,880
Hey.

1602
01:15:52,616 --> 01:15:53,950
Mark loves you.

1603
01:15:56,185 --> 01:15:57,587
I can see it.

1604
01:15:58,888 --> 01:16:00,690
He'll be here, ok?

1605
01:16:00,724 --> 01:16:01,958
I promise.

1606
01:16:05,128 --> 01:16:07,096
Jim, have you seen Stewart?

1607
01:16:07,997 --> 01:16:10,199
Stewart's missing?

1608
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:17,641
Wait.

1609
01:16:18,341 --> 01:16:20,009
Mark's missing too.

1610
01:16:20,944 --> 01:16:24,180
Shit give me your keys.

1611
01:16:24,213 --> 01:16:25,281

Man what the hell is that?

1614
01:16:31,688 --> 01:16:32,889
It's called the garvin.

1615
01:16:32,922 --> 01:16:34,323
You a sick kid, you know that?

1616
01:16:34,357 --> 01:16:36,392
I cold knock your little
ass out for doing that.

1617
01:16:36,425 --> 01:16:39,328
Throwing ass fragments
at human beings.

1618
01:16:39,362 --> 01:16:41,230
Don't smile at me.

1619
01:16:41,264 --> 01:16:42,632
You rotten.

Skunk, where are ya?

with fava beens for dinner.

I know you've done
something to Mark.

1631
01:17:21,437 --> 01:17:23,639

Hey buddy, you've gotta
let Mark go, alright?

01:18:41,985 --> 01:18:44,220
He stole your girl Jim,
and now he's gonna get

1645
01:18:44,253 --> 01:18:45,989
what he's got coming.

1646

He is dealing with a
retarded individual.

1647

You and Laurie, you
go get married.

You will never meet the

Don't listen to him, ok?

Have a corn beef sandwhich, guy.

1707

It's on me.

1708
01:20:58,354 --> 01:21:00,489
He tells me payback's a bitch.

1709
01:21:00,523 --> 01:21:02,125
What the fuck is-
payback for what?

What the hell were
you gonna do to me?

I just let a rapist get away.

You will rape again.

I am sorry, Mark.

I don't trust you.

1720
01:21:33,589 --> 01:21:35,391
I guess I have to work on that.

Could you go a little faster?

Thank you.

the first promise I kept.

01:22:45,128 --> 01:22:47,530
So, what's next?

1741
01:22:47,563 --> 01:22:49,265
I mean next time I come back
I'll be the voice

The partridge family.

01:29:48,183 --> 01:29:50,586
Could I just have a
tissue for one second?

1831
01:29:50,819 --> 01:29:54,857
She'll Jeffrey
dommer your balls.

01:30:47,843 --> 01:30:49,011
One more yell. Just
scream at him.

1845
01:30:49,044 --> 01:30:52,648
Look at him and just go- scream

Sorry guys.

You ran away from here to
become something there.

1857
01:31:22,711 --> 01:31:23,679
Fuck off.

1858
01:31:24,747 --> 01:31:25,280
I'd like to be known for
something a little cooler

1859
01:31:25,313 --> 01:31:27,115
than the all city guy.

1860
01:31:27,149 --> 01:31:29,652
Yeah you could be
the old spice guy.

1861
01:31:29,685 --> 01:31:31,286
Or that asshole in
that show ringer.

1862
01:31:31,319 --> 01:31:32,721
Take that back.

1863
01:31:33,822 --> 01:31:37,993
One wrong move, and I will line
up all four of you,

What did I say?

1868
01:31:44,633 --> 01:31:45,734
What was I supposed to say?

1869
01:31:45,768 --> 01:31:46,969
What was the word?

1870
01:31:47,002 --> 01:31:49,638
I'll squarely fuck
you in the ass.

1871
01:31:50,606 --> 01:31:51,239
Everybody remain calm.

1872
01:31:51,273 --> 01:31:52,240
It is squarely, isn't it?

1873
01:31:52,274 --> 01:31:53,676
Fuck you square in the ass.

All city insurance.

1881
