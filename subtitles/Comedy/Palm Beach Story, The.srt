1
00:00:47,919 --> 00:00:50,683
<i>Everybody tells me
That it's so hard to make it</i>

2
00:00:50,855 --> 00:00:52,345
<i>It's so hard to break in</i>

3
00:00:52,523 --> 00:00:54,115
<i>There's no way to fake it</i>

4
00:00:54,292 --> 00:00:57,193
<i>Everybody tells me
That it's wrong what I'm feeling</i>

5
00:00:57,361 --> 00:01:00,159
<i>I shouldn't believe in
The dreams that I'm dreaming</i>

6
00:01:00,331 --> 00:01:01,992
<i>I hear it every day</i>

7
00:01:02,166 --> 00:01:03,292
<i>I hear it all the time</i>

8
00:01:03,468 --> 00:01:06,904
<i>I'm never gonna amount to much
But they're never gonna change my mind</i>

9
00:01:07,071 --> 00:01:09,699
<i>Tell me, tell me
Tell me somethin' I don't know</i>

10
00:01:09,874 --> 00:01:11,205
<i>Somethin' I don't know</i>

11
00:01:11,375 --> 00:01:13,070
<i>Somethin' I don't know</i>

12
00:01:13,244 --> 00:01:16,008
<i>How many inches in a mile?
What it takes to make you smile?</i>

13
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:19,479
<i>Get you not to treat me like
A child, baby</i>

14
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:21,914
Mary!

15
00:01:22,653 --> 00:01:28,148
How can I be an artist
when you can't be bothered to do your job?

16
00:01:28,326 --> 00:01:30,521
Which, by the way,
is fetching me bubbly water.

17
00:01:33,798 --> 00:01:37,666
- Are you trying to ruin me?
- I'm sorry. It won't happen again.

18
00:01:38,102 --> 00:01:40,366
There are people
who would just kill for this job.

19
00:01:40,538 --> 00:01:41,698
Important people.

20
00:01:41,873 --> 00:01:44,842
Bubble me now or you're grounded.
Stay out of my dressing room.

21
00:01:45,009 --> 00:01:48,672
I hate your energy.
It's ugly and sad and lonely.

22
00:01:53,117 --> 00:01:57,281
Oh, my God. Thank you so much, Mary.
That was the last bottle of bubbly.

23
00:01:57,455 --> 00:02:00,356
No, thank you, Britt.
Your mom's gonna kill me.

24
00:02:00,758 --> 00:02:02,316
- Not my problem.
- So true.

25
00:02:02,493 --> 00:02:05,189
Um, they told me to tell you
you're holding the whole shoot up.

26
00:02:05,363 --> 00:02:07,354
And you work for us, in case you forgot.

27
00:02:07,532 --> 00:02:09,295
Oh, how could I ever forget?

28
00:02:09,734 --> 00:02:13,500
Oh, it's a tragic story.
Her mother was one of my dancers.

29
00:02:13,671 --> 00:02:16,640
Truth to tell, probably the weak link.

30
00:02:16,808 --> 00:02:18,639
But then she died.

31
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:22,337
And I needed some help around the house,
so I took her little brat in.

32
00:02:22,513 --> 00:02:24,174
I'm really a saint, you know?

33
00:02:24,348 --> 00:02:27,283
Dominique, turtledove.
Listen, we're a bit behind schedule.

34
00:02:27,451 --> 00:02:30,147
What I need from you is
I need you to be a little cuddle...

35
00:02:30,321 --> 00:02:32,755
...and shake that moneymaker
before I'm brown bread.

36
00:02:32,924 --> 00:02:36,121
I have no idea what you are saying.

37
00:02:36,294 --> 00:02:37,989
What's with the attitude?

38
00:02:38,162 --> 00:02:40,130
We are so good to you.

39
00:02:40,298 --> 00:02:43,927
You may live in the 90210,
but you're still just a zero.

40
00:02:46,003 --> 00:02:48,995
We live in the 90211, genius.

41
00:02:49,173 --> 00:02:51,835
Mary, bubbles! Now!

42
00:02:52,009 --> 00:02:53,476
Coming, Dominique.

43
00:02:53,644 --> 00:02:54,668
Is that true?

44
00:02:54,846 --> 00:02:56,575
3C, take one. Mark.

45
00:02:56,747 --> 00:02:59,841
<i>I'm on hold for you</i>

46
00:03:00,017 --> 00:03:02,485
<i>I keep pushing number one and two</i>

47
00:03:02,653 --> 00:03:04,120
<i>That's me, Dominique.</i>

48
00:03:04,288 --> 00:03:07,621
<i>I'm singing my number-one hit,
"On Hold 4 You."</i>

49
00:03:07,792 --> 00:03:11,694
<i>For an hour or two
On hold for you</i>

50
00:03:11,963 --> 00:03:16,024
<i>You know, I'm not just
a pop star, I'm also a human being.</i>

51
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:19,963
<i>And I've suffered
from embarrassing back acne for years.</i>

52
00:03:21,339 --> 00:03:23,466
When they used
to shoot my music videos...

53
00:03:23,641 --> 00:03:27,133
...they had to digitally remove
my entire back...

54
00:03:27,311 --> 00:03:28,539
...and my arms...

55
00:03:28,713 --> 00:03:30,442
...and my legs.

56
00:03:30,615 --> 00:03:34,449
I looked terrible and I sued everyone.
It was embarrassing.

57
00:03:35,253 --> 00:03:38,950
Not since I've been using
Baby Got Bacne Vanishing Cream.

58
00:03:39,123 --> 00:03:41,683
<i>Baby Got Bacne works
by destroying blemishes...</i>

59
00:03:41,859 --> 00:03:45,192
<i>... pores and all surrounding skin.</i>

60
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:49,524
<i>I like clear skin and that's the truth</i>

61
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,827
<i>All you sisters just look uncouth</i>

62
00:03:52,003 --> 00:03:54,164
<i>You give your man a heart attack</i>

63
00:03:54,338 --> 00:03:56,966
<i>'Cause you got acne on your back</i>

64
00:03:57,475 --> 00:03:58,806
<i>Baby Got Bacne</i>

65
00:03:58,976 --> 00:04:00,967
<i>Live bacne-free.</i>

66
00:04:09,887 --> 00:04:12,481
I'm not gonna do
that old lizard's talk show again.

67
00:04:12,657 --> 00:04:14,818
He's got a serious case
of the grab-hands.

68
00:04:14,992 --> 00:04:17,620
Not that I mind that sort of thing
from someone under 90.

69
00:04:17,795 --> 00:04:19,660
This semester is so gonna rock.

70
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:21,491
Oh, tell me something I don't know.

71
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:24,191
Because I know that
and I know everything.

72
00:04:24,969 --> 00:04:26,664
- There's laundry to do.
- Okay.

73
00:04:40,885 --> 00:04:42,876
He's coming back
for the rest of the year.

74
00:04:43,054 --> 00:04:44,351
I mean, how hot is that?

75
00:04:44,522 --> 00:04:46,080
Like surface-of-the-sun hot.

76
00:04:46,257 --> 00:04:48,953
- Don't you dare turn on that TV set.
- Okay.

77
00:04:49,126 --> 00:04:50,855
- Yeah.
- Turn it, turn it, turn it.

78
00:04:51,028 --> 00:04:55,590
<i>I'm here at Beverly Glen High School,
where there's nothing but buzz, buzz, buzz.</i>

79
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,031
<i>Fresh from his fourth world tour...</i>

80
00:04:58,202 --> 00:05:02,832
<i>... teen heartthrob Joey Parker has decided
to bring his triple threat of singing...</i>

81
00:05:03,007 --> 00:05:07,034
<i>... dancing and breaking hearts
back home to the Hills.</i>

82
00:05:07,511 --> 00:05:11,607
<i>That girl, baby</i>

83
00:05:11,782 --> 00:05:12,806
Oh...

84
00:05:12,984 --> 00:05:17,148
<i>She knew she's just that girl
She knew she's just that girl</i>

85
00:05:18,622 --> 00:05:20,590
<i>Joey, can you
give me any information...</i>

86
00:05:20,758 --> 00:05:22,157
<i>... about what you're doing in the future?</i>

87
00:05:22,326 --> 00:05:25,784
<i>Just get back to my roots, take
my senior year off, go back to school.</i>

88
00:05:25,963 --> 00:05:27,658
<i>I'm just trying to keep it real.</i>

89
00:05:27,832 --> 00:05:30,062
<i>How does JP plan to keep it real?</i>

90
00:05:30,234 --> 00:05:33,635
<i>Joey and his record label are sponsoring
a huge dance competition...</i>

91
00:05:33,804 --> 00:05:37,570
<i>... where one lucky student
will win the opportunity...</i>

92
00:05:37,742 --> 00:05:40,006
<i>... to dance with JP in his next video.</i>

93
00:05:40,177 --> 00:05:44,580
<i>So all you dancers in waiting,
it's time to get your freak on.</i>

94
00:05:44,749 --> 00:05:48,446
<i>Mary, I need you pronto, now.
You forgot to TiVo my soaps.</i>

95
00:05:48,619 --> 00:05:50,143
Oh...

96
00:05:50,554 --> 00:05:52,522
Sorry, Dominique, I'll be right there.

97
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:54,089
<i>Can you feel that?</i>

98
00:05:54,925 --> 00:05:58,486
<i>- What?
- I'm choking you from a distance.</i>

99
00:05:58,662 --> 00:06:00,789
<i>Choking you!</i>

100
00:06:17,948 --> 00:06:21,076
- Hey.
- Hey. What up?

101
00:06:27,491 --> 00:06:30,016
Tami, you should really get
this thing fixed.

102
00:06:30,194 --> 00:06:33,721
Thing? Don't hurt her feelings
or she'll break down for good.

103
00:06:34,765 --> 00:06:37,928
We have to respect the Great Pumpkin.

104
00:06:39,336 --> 00:06:41,463
You're so weird, Tami.

105
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:43,834
Hey, you think my leather
goes with my tutu?

106
00:06:44,008 --> 00:06:46,568
You look amazing, as always.

107
00:06:46,744 --> 00:06:47,768
It's a Tami original.

108
00:06:47,945 --> 00:06:51,210
I figured I should dress in style
for our last semester together, ever.

109
00:06:51,382 --> 00:06:54,647
Aw... Do you think you could
survive senior year without me?

110
00:06:54,819 --> 00:06:57,686
I'm gonna start my own clothing line
and become a billionaire.

111
00:06:57,855 --> 00:06:59,846
And you'll be a superstar
in dance school...

112
00:07:00,024 --> 00:07:04,688
...and on weekends, I'll pick you up in my
private jet and we'll go shopping in Paris.

113
00:07:04,862 --> 00:07:07,262
- Wow.
- Embrace your awesomeness.

114
00:07:07,431 --> 00:07:11,265
Tami, I have to get into dance school
before I embrace my awesomeness.

115
00:07:11,435 --> 00:07:13,995
Shut up, you're gonna get in.

116
00:07:14,171 --> 00:07:16,969
Don't even pretend to think otherwise.

117
00:07:17,141 --> 00:07:19,939
Yeah, I'm telling you.
Seriously, it's better for your skin.

118
00:07:21,045 --> 00:07:22,876
It's called the one-sip diet.

119
00:07:27,551 --> 00:07:31,749
I am so sorry, Mary.
I didn't even see you standing there.

120
00:07:31,922 --> 00:07:34,288
It's like you were totally invisible.

121
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:37,291
Check out my totally invisible finger.

122
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:46,098
- Halloween was in October, tutu.
- Then why are you dressed like a tool?

123
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:49,034
That was code for "Your butt rules."
Which it totally does.

124
00:07:49,206 --> 00:07:51,037
Tell me something I don't know.

125
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:54,575
Oh, my God. It's Joey Parker!

126
00:07:58,883 --> 00:08:01,010
I love drama. It's so dramatic.

127
00:08:01,185 --> 00:08:03,745
- Let's go before we get trampled.
- Okay.

128
00:08:10,961 --> 00:08:12,326
Hey.

129
00:08:13,364 --> 00:08:15,491
What's up, everybody?

130
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:16,894
Oh, my God.
- Oh.

131
00:08:17,067 --> 00:08:18,932
Make way, people. No touching.

132
00:08:19,103 --> 00:08:20,730
God, all right, JP's here.

133
00:08:20,905 --> 00:08:23,066
Hey, Joey, party at my house
on Friday, dude.

134
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:27,802
I'm gonna be in your contest, Joey.
You wanna practice in private?

135
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:29,505
Maybe. Ha-ha.

136
00:08:30,047 --> 00:08:33,107
- Oh, my God. I love you so much.
- Hey, thanks.

137
00:08:35,586 --> 00:08:37,952
That's nasty. JP, step over that.

138
00:08:43,494 --> 00:08:46,258
I don't want you to feel like
a prepackaged piece of meat.

139
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:47,658
Your words, not mine.

140
00:08:47,831 --> 00:08:51,790
I just want you to chillax.
And remember, I got your bacne.

141
00:08:51,969 --> 00:08:55,871
<i>- I got bacne, you got bacne, we got bacne...
- Don't even get started with her.</i>

142
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,829
Ow! Oh...

143
00:08:58,008 --> 00:09:01,034
Sorry. Sorry, I wasn't looking, I just...

144
00:09:01,212 --> 00:09:04,045
Hey, Joey, long time no kiss.

145
00:09:05,282 --> 00:09:06,374
Are you okay?

146
00:09:07,851 --> 00:09:09,375
Wow, Natalia, hi.

147
00:09:09,553 --> 00:09:11,350
You can't call me back?

148
00:09:11,522 --> 00:09:14,252
I was on tour, in Japan, you know?

149
00:09:14,425 --> 00:09:17,519
It was such a long year without you.

150
00:09:17,695 --> 00:09:19,822
Look, um, Natalia...

151
00:09:19,997 --> 00:09:23,262
First things first. I heard
that you were coming to dance class.

152
00:09:23,434 --> 00:09:25,026
<i>Save me.</i>

153
00:09:30,007 --> 00:09:31,531
Nice tutu.

154
00:09:32,676 --> 00:09:33,802
Thanks.

155
00:09:34,645 --> 00:09:36,510
- I think.
- I'm Dustin.

156
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,511
But the people call me the Funk.

157
00:09:38,882 --> 00:09:40,509
Well, that's unfortunate.

158
00:09:40,684 --> 00:09:43,653
Ah. Feisty, yeah. I like feisty.

159
00:09:45,189 --> 00:09:47,054
I'll see you around.

160
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:50,891
Why would I wanna go out
with a guy named the Funk?

161
00:09:51,061 --> 00:09:52,085
Because he's cute.

162
00:09:52,263 --> 00:09:54,390
What's your damage, Mary?

163
00:09:54,565 --> 00:09:56,260
Nothing. What's your damage?

164
00:09:56,433 --> 00:09:57,957
This is our hallway.

165
00:09:58,135 --> 00:09:59,625
Or did you trolls forget that?

166
00:09:59,803 --> 00:10:01,600
Oh, yeah? You want a piece of me?

167
00:10:01,772 --> 00:10:04,832
Come on, Tami, it's not even worth it.

168
00:10:05,976 --> 00:10:08,240
What's a troll?

169
00:10:59,963 --> 00:11:03,763
Hey, Natalia. It was a tragedy
when you and Joey broke up.

170
00:11:03,934 --> 00:11:07,301
Seeing him must feel like getting dumped
all over again.

171
00:11:07,471 --> 00:11:10,998
Joey and I will be together again
before the Black and White Ball.

172
00:11:13,043 --> 00:11:14,567
Good afternoon, class.

173
00:11:14,745 --> 00:11:17,509
It's one thing to dance with your feet.

174
00:11:17,681 --> 00:11:20,013
It's another thing
to dance with your heart.

175
00:11:20,184 --> 00:11:23,517
Let's start with some sun salutations.

176
00:11:23,687 --> 00:11:27,088
Inhale and exhale...

177
00:11:27,257 --> 00:11:31,250
...and inhale and exhale.

178
00:11:31,428 --> 00:11:33,157
Oh, my God. It's Joey Parker!

179
00:11:34,331 --> 00:11:36,265
- Hey, what's up?
- Joey.

180
00:11:36,433 --> 00:11:41,996
Joey, as I live and dance,
I'm so glad you had the time to stop by.

181
00:11:42,606 --> 00:11:43,834
How could I say no to you?

182
00:11:44,007 --> 00:11:48,000
Girls and boys, I know all of you
are planning on enrolling in his competition.

183
00:11:48,178 --> 00:11:50,646
I thought you might like
to learn some moves...

184
00:11:50,814 --> 00:11:53,044
...from the man who made them famous:

185
00:11:53,717 --> 00:11:55,514
Joey Parker.

186
00:11:55,686 --> 00:11:57,517
- Okay, how you guys doing?
- Great.

187
00:11:57,688 --> 00:11:59,679
Yeah?
You ready to show me what you got?

188
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:02,522
Okay, nice.
I'm gonna start off the combination.

189
00:12:02,693 --> 00:12:06,151
I'm gonna show it to you slow
and then we speed it up, okay? Follow me.

190
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:07,957
Five, six, seven, eight.

191
00:12:08,132 --> 00:12:09,861
Hit, one, two...

192
00:12:11,468 --> 00:12:12,992
That's right.

193
00:12:14,138 --> 00:12:16,231
Five, six, watch me.

194
00:12:16,407 --> 00:12:18,807
One, two. Three, four...

195
00:12:19,576 --> 00:12:22,670
Seven and eight. One, two...

196
00:12:22,846 --> 00:12:24,905
Five, six, and seven, and eight.

197
00:12:25,082 --> 00:12:26,811
One, two.

198
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:35,324
Let's just do the whole thing up to tempo,
you ready?

199
00:12:35,492 --> 00:12:37,687
Okay, your energy's about a five,
I need a 10.

200
00:12:37,861 --> 00:12:39,488
Here we go.

201
00:12:57,247 --> 00:12:58,509
Oh, come on.

202
00:12:58,682 --> 00:13:01,344
Okay, okay. You guys got
the moves down. That was great.

203
00:13:01,518 --> 00:13:04,351
Why don't we do it again?
We'll break it down, do it slower.

204
00:13:04,521 --> 00:13:07,388
So you can put your own style on it.
And make it your own.

205
00:13:07,558 --> 00:13:09,788
We'll start in the same spot.
Here we go, ready?

206
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,951
And five, six.

207
00:13:12,129 --> 00:13:15,030
And five, six, seven, eight.

208
00:13:39,456 --> 00:13:40,480
Oh!

209
00:13:59,643 --> 00:14:00,871
Yeah.

210
00:14:01,044 --> 00:14:02,978
Okay, one last time.

211
00:14:04,381 --> 00:14:07,214
Five, six, seven, eight.

212
00:14:27,971 --> 00:14:31,338
Nice. Now, if you guys can dance
like that in the competition...

213
00:14:31,508 --> 00:14:33,032
...we're gonna have some serious fun.

214
00:14:35,012 --> 00:14:37,276
- What did I say about cell phones in class?
- Oh!

215
00:14:41,318 --> 00:14:42,376
<i>Where are you?</i>

216
00:14:42,553 --> 00:14:45,488
The most important luncheon of my life
and you forget?

217
00:14:45,656 --> 00:14:48,284
I'm sorry. I'm on my way.
I'll be there soon.

218
00:14:48,458 --> 00:14:50,085
I don't want whispered excuses.

219
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:53,024
I want crab puffs on a tray.

220
00:14:55,232 --> 00:14:56,563
Hello?

221
00:15:01,939 --> 00:15:03,406
I have crab puffs to make.

222
00:15:03,574 --> 00:15:05,201
Then you know who's coming over.

223
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:07,240
It's just your crush: Joey Parker.

224
00:15:07,644 --> 00:15:09,578
I don't have a crush on Joey Parker.

225
00:15:09,746 --> 00:15:12,715
Oh, no? Then what's this?

226
00:15:17,921 --> 00:15:23,757
<i>Hi, I'm Mary and I'd like to send this video
to Joey Parker because he rocks.</i>

227
00:15:23,927 --> 00:15:25,588
What's this? A freakish stalker...

228
00:15:25,762 --> 00:15:28,492
...with an embarrassing crush on Joey.
- Snap.

229
00:15:28,665 --> 00:15:30,758
You went through my stuff.

230
00:15:30,934 --> 00:15:32,834
No, just watch. It gets better.

231
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:36,002
<i>I love you so much, Joey.</i>

232
00:15:36,173 --> 00:15:38,573
<i>And you're totally kissable.</i>

233
00:15:41,044 --> 00:15:42,341
<i>This is for you.</i>

234
00:15:53,357 --> 00:15:55,018
The dork princess.

235
00:15:55,192 --> 00:15:57,786
Troll. She's a troll.

236
00:15:57,961 --> 00:15:59,792
That's not our only copy.

237
00:15:59,963 --> 00:16:01,294
Jinx, give me your Vera Wang.

238
00:16:01,465 --> 00:16:02,625
Give me your Jimmy Choo.

239
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:04,323
- No, seriously?
- I said it first.

240
00:16:04,501 --> 00:16:06,366
- You shut up.
- Oh, stop.

241
00:16:06,536 --> 00:16:09,596
That's it.
- Ow! Mom!

242
00:16:11,608 --> 00:16:13,269
Have another crab puff, Rod.

243
00:16:14,044 --> 00:16:17,138
Mom, he's hungry. It's been 40 minutes.

244
00:16:17,781 --> 00:16:20,409
Look, you asked me to come, I'm here.

245
00:16:20,584 --> 00:16:24,020
- But five more minutes and I'm out.
- I'm right behind you, JP.

246
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:30,148
Joey, I know that you and Dominique
have had your differences...

247
00:16:30,327 --> 00:16:33,763
<i>...but try not to bring up
the time she dissed you on TRL.</i>

248
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:34,954
She didn't mean it.

249
00:16:35,132 --> 00:16:37,999
How do you call someone overrated
and not mean it? That's just disrespect.

250
00:16:38,168 --> 00:16:39,260
Shh.

251
00:16:41,004 --> 00:16:45,407
Joey, doing a duet with Dominique
means reaching her audience.

252
00:16:45,575 --> 00:16:47,008
Like Daddy and I.

253
00:16:47,477 --> 00:16:49,411
And if doing a duet means that Mommy...

254
00:16:51,214 --> 00:16:55,344
- The family can have another house, well...
- Okay, Mom, you have a house.

255
00:16:55,619 --> 00:16:56,643
Okay?

256
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:59,789
Nobody's bought a Dominique CD
in years. I mean, she's not cool.

257
00:16:59,956 --> 00:17:00,980
I think she's cool.

258
00:17:02,059 --> 00:17:03,959
Thank you. Exactly.

259
00:17:04,127 --> 00:17:05,617
Hi.

260
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:11,126
Look at all of these beautiful people.

261
00:17:11,301 --> 00:17:13,428
Well, I'm so sorry
to keep you all waiting.

262
00:17:13,603 --> 00:17:17,004
But it took 20 minutes
to descend the staircase.

263
00:17:17,174 --> 00:17:19,642
But it was worth it, don't you think?

264
00:17:19,976 --> 00:17:21,500
Hello, Rod. No, no.

265
00:17:21,678 --> 00:17:23,976
Evie. No, no, no.

266
00:17:24,147 --> 00:17:26,342
- Young man whose name I don't know.
- I'm...

267
00:17:26,516 --> 00:17:27,710
Oh. Shh.

268
00:17:27,884 --> 00:17:29,852
Wow, that's some dress.

269
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:33,114
Oh, yeah?
I'm wearing this in my next video.

270
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:36,225
It's a duet, great stuff.

271
00:17:36,393 --> 00:17:38,486
Hello, Grammy. Ha-ha-ha.

272
00:17:39,863 --> 00:17:42,195
But enough about me, for now.

273
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,795
Oh, let me help you.

274
00:17:44,968 --> 00:17:46,196
- Yeah. Um...
- Thank you.

275
00:17:46,369 --> 00:17:48,234
Look, Dominique...

276
00:17:49,406 --> 00:17:52,307
...I'm not doing the duet with you, okay?

277
00:17:52,476 --> 00:17:54,137
No, listen to what she has to say.

278
00:17:54,311 --> 00:17:55,642
Zip it, Rod.
- Or not.

279
00:17:55,812 --> 00:17:57,837
Drinks, we need drinks. Mary?

280
00:17:58,381 --> 00:18:00,144
Well, thanks, but I don't drink.

281
00:18:00,317 --> 00:18:02,979
- Oh, my God.
- Sorry. Thank you.

282
00:18:03,353 --> 00:18:05,719
Of course you don't, darling boy,
but I do.

283
00:18:05,889 --> 00:18:07,686
- Okay.
- I drink.

284
00:18:07,958 --> 00:18:09,255
- So, Joey...
- I'll get you one.

285
00:18:09,426 --> 00:18:11,485
...asked anyone
to the Black and White Ball yet?

286
00:18:11,661 --> 00:18:13,856
You have a crab puff in your teeth, Britt.

287
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:16,191
- You should really take me to the ball.
- Yeah.

288
00:18:16,366 --> 00:18:19,199
I speak French. How about you?

289
00:18:19,369 --> 00:18:20,631
Thanks, yeah.

290
00:18:20,804 --> 00:18:24,296
Look, Dominique, I'm kind of on a break
right now, so...

291
00:18:24,474 --> 00:18:27,932
You all must be famished.
First course, Mary. Now.

292
00:18:28,678 --> 00:18:32,114
Joey would gladly take a break
from his break.

293
00:18:32,282 --> 00:18:35,080
No. No, no.
Actually, I am focusing on school.

294
00:18:35,252 --> 00:18:39,211
- I'm just hanging with friends, you know?
- That's right. The new JP.

295
00:18:39,389 --> 00:18:40,617
Who are you?

296
00:18:40,791 --> 00:18:42,258
I'm Joey Parker's manager.

297
00:18:42,425 --> 00:18:45,121
Oh, please ignore him.

298
00:18:45,295 --> 00:18:46,922
I'm Joey's manager.

299
00:18:47,097 --> 00:18:48,758
You have two managers?

300
00:18:48,932 --> 00:18:51,594
- Apparently.
- You must be a real handful.

301
00:18:51,768 --> 00:18:53,201
Wanna make out?

302
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:55,235
You know, actually, technically, I'm...

303
00:18:55,405 --> 00:18:58,704
Oh, shut up, Rod. Even I know
you're completely inconsequential.

304
00:18:58,875 --> 00:19:00,433
You see? It's not just me.

305
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:02,771
This is why I did not wanna come today.

306
00:19:03,647 --> 00:19:04,875
You're all nuts.

307
00:19:05,282 --> 00:19:09,150
You can either do the duet with me
and become a superstar...

308
00:19:09,319 --> 00:19:14,052
...or you can fade away
into teenybopper obscurity.

309
00:19:14,224 --> 00:19:16,954
Okay. I've heard enough, okay?

310
00:19:17,127 --> 00:19:19,595
Joey Parker is a man
that needs to do things his way.

311
00:19:19,763 --> 00:19:24,826
He needs to keep it real. So from here
on out, I'm Joey Parker's only manager.

312
00:19:25,001 --> 00:19:26,525
I think we're done here. Let's go.

313
00:19:26,703 --> 00:19:28,000
Thanks for everything.

314
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,632
We keep meeting like this.

315
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:36,438
You have shrimp in your hair.

316
00:19:36,613 --> 00:19:37,739
Come on.

317
00:19:37,914 --> 00:19:39,245
- You all right?
- That's nuts.

318
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:41,281
- You hear how he...?
- I don't care!

319
00:19:41,451 --> 00:19:43,078
Are you ready?
- Mary?

320
00:19:43,253 --> 00:19:44,277
Let's go.

321
00:19:44,454 --> 00:19:49,323
You will clean this room spotless
in 30 minutes. Rod.

322
00:19:50,961 --> 00:19:54,419
And your phone privileges are suspended
for an entire month. Cough it up.

323
00:19:54,598 --> 00:19:55,963
Come on, look alive.

324
00:19:56,499 --> 00:19:58,467
Clean.

325
00:19:58,635 --> 00:20:00,364
Joey, honey, wait.

326
00:20:00,537 --> 00:20:02,596
I gotta talk to you.

327
00:20:08,278 --> 00:20:09,939
Tami, don't hate me...

328
00:20:11,948 --> 00:20:13,939
...but I don't wanna go to the ball.

329
00:20:14,117 --> 00:20:17,052
You have to go. I've been working
on our dresses for two weeks.

330
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:19,415
I know. I know. It's just...

331
00:20:19,589 --> 00:20:23,116
I don't know. It's on Valentine's Day.
We don't even have dates.

332
00:20:23,293 --> 00:20:26,194
Plus, everyone's gonna be wearing masks,
which is really weird.

333
00:20:26,363 --> 00:20:30,129
But that's good. We can each meet
a handsome, mysterious stranger.

334
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,868
How will we know he's handsome
if he's wearing a mask?

335
00:20:33,036 --> 00:20:35,561
By how he dances.
Hot guys always dance the best.

336
00:20:35,739 --> 00:20:37,263
- Anyway...
- I don't fit in here.

337
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,806
So why go and pretend like I do?

338
00:20:39,976 --> 00:20:41,409
Guys don't even know I exist.

339
00:20:41,578 --> 00:20:44,138
Again, no one will know who anyone is.

340
00:20:44,314 --> 00:20:46,680
There's no such thing as not fitting in.

341
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:49,182
If there's a guy you like,
he'll meet the real you.

342
00:20:49,352 --> 00:20:53,152
Not some fake you that's been created
by the cliques at our lame-ass high school.

343
00:20:53,323 --> 00:20:55,314
- Don't get me started about... What?
- Tami.

344
00:20:55,492 --> 00:20:58,120
You should really breathe
in between monologues.

345
00:20:58,295 --> 00:20:59,922
You're going to the ball.

346
00:21:01,231 --> 00:21:02,926
Oh, I forgot to start cleaning.

347
00:21:03,767 --> 00:21:05,632
<i>Faster.</i>

348
00:21:07,137 --> 00:21:09,332
Give it a rhythm. Make it a samba.

349
00:21:09,506 --> 00:21:10,666
Give it a:

350
00:21:14,477 --> 00:21:15,774
- Mother.
- Mommy?

351
00:21:15,946 --> 00:21:17,413
Hello, my little pretties.

352
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:21,641
This is Fabio and Paulo
and somebody else.

353
00:21:21,818 --> 00:21:24,912
I'm thinking of making one of them
my new daddy.

354
00:21:25,488 --> 00:21:27,422
I mean, your new daddy.

355
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:29,581
Anyway, uh...

356
00:21:29,759 --> 00:21:32,819
...we were on our way to get manis
and pedis for the ball tonight.

357
00:21:32,996 --> 00:21:36,432
Which we heard Mary talking about, FYI.

358
00:21:36,599 --> 00:21:39,295
As in she's planning to go, FYI.

359
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:41,401
Oh. Oh...

360
00:21:41,571 --> 00:21:43,436
That won't do.

361
00:21:44,374 --> 00:21:46,706
Uh, you could tell her to clean my room.

362
00:21:46,876 --> 00:21:49,037
And my closet.
I think something died in there.

363
00:21:49,212 --> 00:21:51,009
No, no, no.

364
00:21:51,181 --> 00:21:56,949
I have a very special place
that needs cleaning.

365
00:21:58,788 --> 00:21:59,948
Mary?

366
00:22:01,524 --> 00:22:05,221
- The twins are turning 16 next week.
- Didn't they turn 16 last year?

367
00:22:05,595 --> 00:22:09,361
Yes, and they'll keep turning 16
until I tell them to stop.

368
00:22:09,532 --> 00:22:13,525
We're having a big party
and I need this house to be spotless.

369
00:22:13,703 --> 00:22:17,969
But Tami and I are going to the ball.
Plus, I've cleaned every room in this house.

370
00:22:18,141 --> 00:22:19,733
Not...

371
00:22:21,244 --> 00:22:23,007
...my bedroom.

372
00:22:28,151 --> 00:22:30,517
You're kidding me, right?

373
00:22:31,354 --> 00:22:32,821
I'm clubbing with Paris tonight.

374
00:22:32,989 --> 00:22:36,652
It's my turn to throw the after-party.
Don't step on my hair.

375
00:22:36,826 --> 00:22:41,695
When I get home at midnight,
this room will be pristine.

376
00:22:41,865 --> 00:22:45,198
Dominique, I'd need heavy equipment.
For example, a flamethrower.

377
00:22:45,568 --> 00:22:48,867
Don't you sass me, smarty pants.

378
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:51,098
I'll revoke your school privileges.

379
00:22:51,274 --> 00:22:53,504
You could say goodbye
to those trendy friends.

380
00:22:53,676 --> 00:22:59,114
Or shall I say friend,
Little Miss Not-So-Popular?

381
00:23:01,351 --> 00:23:02,375
Ooh!

382
00:23:03,086 --> 00:23:06,385
Oh, and clean up these fish sticks.
They've been there since Lent.

383
00:23:12,929 --> 00:23:14,362
<i>Tami, I can't go to the ball.</i>

384
00:23:14,531 --> 00:23:16,465
"Domifreak's" making me clean
her bedroom.

385
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,968
You're in her lair?

386
00:23:19,135 --> 00:23:22,229
There are species of bugs in here
still unknown to science.

387
00:23:22,405 --> 00:23:24,805
<i>There's no way I'll finish in time.</i>

388
00:23:25,275 --> 00:23:27,243
<i>- Wait, what if...?
- Who are you talking to?</i>

389
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:31,077
<i>When I said no phone privileges,
that included the landline.</i>

390
00:23:31,247 --> 00:23:32,805
I'm sorry. I have to go.

391
00:23:41,658 --> 00:23:43,023
Ugh.

392
00:24:19,696 --> 00:24:23,860
Manson, we've been looking for you
since Christmas, boy.

393
00:24:24,033 --> 00:24:26,024
You're free, boy. Go. Go, go.

394
00:24:33,276 --> 00:24:35,471
Go, Manson, go. You're free. Oh, hey.

395
00:24:35,645 --> 00:24:39,274
Gosh, look, I just found Manson.
And please tell me those aren't our dresses.

396
00:24:39,682 --> 00:24:42,310
I can't. Because they are.

397
00:24:42,485 --> 00:24:44,146
We're going to the ball.

398
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:48,222
Tami, what part of "Domifreak's making me
clean her bedroom" did you not understand?

399
00:24:48,791 --> 00:24:52,192
What would you say if I told you
I could clean up the mess for you...

400
00:24:52,362 --> 00:24:54,455
...and Dominique would never know?

401
00:24:54,631 --> 00:24:58,397
I'd say you're my hero, but there's no way,
and you have to go to the ball.

402
00:24:58,568 --> 00:25:03,164
- Plus, you can't clean this mess up alone.
- Well, who said I was alone?

403
00:25:04,474 --> 00:25:05,498
- Hi, Mary.
- Hey.

404
00:25:06,142 --> 00:25:07,507
You did this for me?

405
00:25:07,677 --> 00:25:10,407
Mary, meet my sister's
boyfriend's cousins.

406
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:13,048
Cousins, this is Mary.

407
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:15,411
Hello, hello. You go to dance?

408
00:25:15,585 --> 00:25:16,847
Very nice.

409
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:18,248
House clean by midnight?

410
00:25:18,421 --> 00:25:23,154
No problem. Like van say, "No mess...

411
00:25:23,326 --> 00:25:25,590
...too messy."
- Okay.

412
00:25:28,164 --> 00:25:29,722
This mess is too messy.

413
00:25:29,899 --> 00:25:32,424
- Lee-Ha, you promised.
- Is there a problem?

414
00:25:32,602 --> 00:25:35,537
I'm on it. Get started and hide the van.

415
00:25:39,742 --> 00:25:40,868
Isn't that him?

416
00:25:41,044 --> 00:25:44,411
No, that's not him.
Oh, that's him. No, it's not.

417
00:25:45,548 --> 00:25:47,072
Joey can dance.

418
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:49,684
When we see a guy who can move,
we'll have our man.

419
00:25:49,852 --> 00:25:51,945
Let me know when you find him.

420
00:25:52,121 --> 00:25:55,056
Hey, we were just looking for you.

421
00:25:55,225 --> 00:25:58,023
Yeah, I'm sure you were.

422
00:25:59,295 --> 00:26:01,627
- Nice mask.
- Nice dress.

423
00:26:01,798 --> 00:26:03,789
Nice face.

424
00:26:05,535 --> 00:26:07,298
Hey, ladies, hey.

425
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:10,462
Boo, where you going?
All the funk you need is right here.

426
00:26:13,576 --> 00:26:15,203
Man.

427
00:26:15,645 --> 00:26:16,907
Hey, man.

428
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:19,275
Why did you tell me this
was a costume party?

429
00:26:19,449 --> 00:26:20,882
It is the Black and White Ball.

430
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:22,642
You look good, man. This is sharp.

431
00:26:22,819 --> 00:26:24,844
I do clean up good, huh?

432
00:26:26,055 --> 00:26:28,489
I guess I'm not the only one
who didn't get the memo.

433
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:33,493
- Who is that?
- No idea.

434
00:26:34,664 --> 00:26:36,097
But I'm gonna find out.

435
00:26:36,532 --> 00:26:37,931
Everyone's looking at me.

436
00:26:38,101 --> 00:26:41,002
Who's the Lohan
who decided to make her own rules?

437
00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:43,229
You need a drink.
Punch bowl, straight ahead.

438
00:26:43,406 --> 00:26:46,842
I don't know, but she looks good.

439
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:51,844
I mean, not good like us. Good like bad.
Pff.

440
00:26:53,182 --> 00:26:55,946
Here they come.
- All right, be cool. Be cool.

441
00:27:01,524 --> 00:27:03,253
Hi.

442
00:27:03,693 --> 00:27:07,527
You really know how to make an entrance.
That, uh, dress is amazing.

443
00:27:08,598 --> 00:27:11,533
Thank you. That's a nice cape.

444
00:27:13,136 --> 00:27:15,536
I mean, coat. It's a nice coat...

445
00:27:15,838 --> 00:27:18,033
- What should I do?
- Say something. Anything.

446
00:27:18,207 --> 00:27:19,936
- He's cute.
- Um...

447
00:27:20,109 --> 00:27:22,669
Hey, do you want some punch?

448
00:27:23,112 --> 00:27:24,875
Or you have some... Cool, okay.

449
00:27:31,788 --> 00:27:32,948
Weird.

450
00:27:33,122 --> 00:27:35,488
- Are you supposed to be Cupid?
- Yeah. Smart girl.

451
00:27:36,059 --> 00:27:37,117
Dope, right?

452
00:27:37,293 --> 00:27:40,558
With these arrows of love,
somebody gonna fall hard tonight.

453
00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:43,062
- Is that so?
- Yeah.

454
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:45,427
Usually, I'm a lot cooler than this.

455
00:27:45,601 --> 00:27:48,399
I'm actually, like,
Joey Parker's best friend, see?

456
00:27:48,571 --> 00:27:51,699
- Is that supposed to impress me?
- Yeah, a little.

457
00:27:52,141 --> 00:27:54,166
You wanna see my Cupid dance?

458
00:28:04,554 --> 00:28:07,250
- What was that?
- I don't usually come to these things.

459
00:28:07,423 --> 00:28:08,720
Yeah, me too.

460
00:28:08,891 --> 00:28:11,257
What? Wait. Do you, um, wanna...?

461
00:28:11,427 --> 00:28:13,190
Wait. You don't like to dance?

462
00:28:13,363 --> 00:28:14,591
Sorry, what?

463
00:28:15,264 --> 00:28:17,095
- Do you wanna...?
- Hey.

464
00:28:17,266 --> 00:28:18,927
Can I ask you to dance?

465
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:22,529
Yes, I'd love to.

466
00:28:27,443 --> 00:28:29,172
Now, don't take this the wrong way...

467
00:28:29,345 --> 00:28:32,075
...but I have never seen anything like you
in my life.

468
00:28:32,248 --> 00:28:34,148
- That's a good thing, right?
- Yes.

469
00:28:34,317 --> 00:28:35,841
Dance with me, Cupid-man.

470
00:28:40,356 --> 00:28:43,519
Do me a favor. Can you play this for me?
Track five.

471
00:28:43,693 --> 00:28:45,661
Here, hold this for me.

472
00:28:45,828 --> 00:28:46,817
Hey.

473
00:28:48,197 --> 00:28:50,256
Shake it, baby.

474
00:28:50,666 --> 00:28:51,690
Nice.

475
00:29:03,413 --> 00:29:06,541
- What was that?
- I guess the music just speaks to me.

476
00:29:12,789 --> 00:29:15,189
Well, I guess
we don't have a language barrier.

477
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:19,960
Isn't that funny? I just love monkeys too.
Anyway, she'd...

478
00:29:21,864 --> 00:29:23,456
Look at him move.

479
00:29:23,633 --> 00:29:25,260
That has to be Joey.

480
00:29:25,435 --> 00:29:27,562
But who's the tramp?

481
00:29:51,894 --> 00:29:52,918
Ow.

482
00:30:32,368 --> 00:30:33,494
Oh...

483
00:30:33,669 --> 00:30:35,330
Oh, hey, are you okay?

484
00:30:38,407 --> 00:30:39,567
You were amazing.

485
00:30:39,742 --> 00:30:41,733
No, I wasn't. I fell.

486
00:30:45,381 --> 00:30:46,405
Joey?

487
00:30:51,921 --> 00:30:53,650
I have to go.

488
00:30:55,091 --> 00:30:56,991
I have to go. Can I have it back?

489
00:30:57,159 --> 00:30:59,525
- Today?
- Is that Joey?

490
00:30:59,695 --> 00:31:01,162
Wait, wait...

491
00:31:01,330 --> 00:31:02,820
- I'm late.
- Where are you...?

492
00:31:03,666 --> 00:31:05,065
Wait.

493
00:31:12,141 --> 00:31:13,733
Oh, my God. That was...

494
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:16,879
Holy cow...
- I feel like I have to throw up.

495
00:31:17,046 --> 00:31:19,708
Tami, if I don't get home by midnight,
I am dead.

496
00:31:19,882 --> 00:31:21,941
You were dancing with Joey Parker.

497
00:31:22,118 --> 00:31:25,349
I fell on my butt with Joey Parker.
God, I knew I shouldn't have come.

498
00:31:25,521 --> 00:31:29,355
- He was into you.
- Because he didn't know who I was.

499
00:31:29,625 --> 00:31:31,115
You really think he was into me?

500
00:31:40,469 --> 00:31:44,235
- I'm so sorry.
- No, no, no, this can't be happening.

501
00:32:09,532 --> 00:32:13,491
I am not doing
that old diva's talk show again.

502
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:15,669
She's got a serious... What?

503
00:32:16,739 --> 00:32:18,070
Oh, God.

504
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:22,506
She's got a serious case
of the grab-hands.

505
00:32:24,213 --> 00:32:27,046
No, no, no, she's right behind me.
Go, go, go.

506
00:32:30,486 --> 00:32:32,147
No, no, no!

507
00:32:32,321 --> 00:32:35,256
That's my answer
to all those talk shows. No!

508
00:32:40,029 --> 00:32:42,623
Go that way, that way, that way. Go.

509
00:32:49,405 --> 00:32:52,203
Hmm. Well, it seems you managed
to follow orders.

510
00:32:52,742 --> 00:32:53,868
For once.

511
00:32:54,777 --> 00:32:56,802
Why are you wearing my robe?

512
00:32:57,179 --> 00:33:00,376
I was admiring its silky quality.

513
00:33:03,619 --> 00:33:08,147
You like my after-party?
It's a total rager, isn't it? Ha-ha.

514
00:33:08,591 --> 00:33:11,219
Oh, it's not a rager at all.

515
00:33:11,394 --> 00:33:13,487
No one's coming.

516
00:33:13,763 --> 00:33:17,722
I'm a Little Miss Not-So-Popular too.

517
00:33:18,734 --> 00:33:21,703
God, I'm so tired.

518
00:33:28,210 --> 00:33:30,007
<i>Thank you.</i>

519
00:33:34,684 --> 00:33:39,314
All right, now, look. If you pull this off,
you will be the prince of all princes, okay?

520
00:33:39,488 --> 00:33:43,015
- Now, just let me talk to the teacher.
- Why aren't you two in class?

521
00:33:45,761 --> 00:33:48,161
I have a huge favor to ask, Miss B.

522
00:33:48,330 --> 00:33:50,890
I need to find somebody
who was at the dance last night.

523
00:33:51,067 --> 00:33:52,932
And if you don't, you'll die?

524
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:56,097
I think I might.

525
00:33:57,873 --> 00:33:59,773
No way.
- Yeah.

526
00:33:59,942 --> 00:34:02,604
Whoever she was, she was a freak show.

527
00:34:02,778 --> 00:34:05,611
Totally.
Who runs away from Joey Parker?

528
00:34:05,781 --> 00:34:07,043
Not me.

529
00:34:07,216 --> 00:34:09,013
She'll never show her face now.

530
00:34:12,254 --> 00:34:14,017
We missed you at the ball, Mary.

531
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:17,125
I guess a maid's job is just never done.

532
00:34:20,763 --> 00:34:24,426
This is an administrative announcement
from the administrative office.

533
00:34:27,002 --> 00:34:28,196
What's up?

534
00:34:28,370 --> 00:34:30,565
You're on the mike
with the Funk master.

535
00:34:32,341 --> 00:34:36,141
<i>- Okay, very funny. Keep the voices down.
- Check it out. Listen up.</i>

536
00:34:36,312 --> 00:34:38,644
<i>Once upon a time
There was this chill hottie</i>

537
00:34:38,814 --> 00:34:41,214
<i>She left Joey Parker
Now, that was real naughty</i>

538
00:34:41,383 --> 00:34:43,374
<i>Now here's JP just to tell you more</i>

539
00:34:43,552 --> 00:34:45,986
<i>Now, put down your pencils
And give JP the floor</i>

540
00:34:46,155 --> 00:34:47,816
All right, Funk, Funk, that's good.

541
00:34:47,990 --> 00:34:49,321
<i>'Cause I was on the mike...</i>

542
00:34:49,492 --> 00:34:51,926
- All right, I got another verse.
- Funk, thank you.

543
00:34:52,094 --> 00:34:54,756
- You're welcome.
- That was the Funk, ladies and gentlemen.

544
00:34:54,930 --> 00:34:56,227
<i>Anyway...</i>

545
00:34:56,398 --> 00:34:59,492
...last night, I, uh...
I danced with somebody at the ball.

546
00:35:00,035 --> 00:35:02,333
<i>And you dropped your Zune
when you left.</i>

547
00:35:02,505 --> 00:35:05,804
<i>I'd love to return it.
The problem is, I don't know who you are.</i>

548
00:35:06,275 --> 00:35:07,936
And this is important...

549
00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:11,944
<i>... because you made
it one of the best nights of my life.</i>

550
00:35:12,248 --> 00:35:13,272
I...

551
00:35:13,449 --> 00:35:15,110
...love him.

552
00:35:15,284 --> 00:35:18,014
You have bacon in your braces.

553
00:35:18,187 --> 00:35:19,848
Keep the voices down.

554
00:35:21,257 --> 00:35:23,452
Okay, so here's the deal. Uh...

555
00:35:23,626 --> 00:35:26,220
If you were the girl
that I danced with last night...

556
00:35:26,395 --> 00:35:30,456
<i>... tell me the names of the four
most-listened-to songs on your playlist.</i>

557
00:35:30,633 --> 00:35:31,861
Thanks, mystery girl.

558
00:35:32,034 --> 00:35:33,262
<i>I'll be waiting.</i>

559
00:35:33,435 --> 00:35:36,165
"Thanks, mystery girl. I'll be waiting."

560
00:35:39,542 --> 00:35:42,067
- That was good. That was good.
- Was that all right?

561
00:35:42,244 --> 00:35:43,871
This is gonna be easy.

562
00:35:45,714 --> 00:35:50,276
I know. I know, sweetie.
It's okay, but you gotta go, okay? All right.

563
00:35:50,452 --> 00:35:52,784
Just... All right, yeah. Whoo.

564
00:35:52,955 --> 00:35:55,287
Everybody, please,
single-file line, all right?

565
00:35:55,457 --> 00:35:57,448
You guys are so not his mystery girl.

566
00:35:57,626 --> 00:36:00,060
All right, everybody's gonna get a chance
to meet JP.

567
00:36:00,229 --> 00:36:01,457
You call me. Ha-ha.

568
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:04,360
All right, all right. Cynthia? It's your turn.

569
00:36:04,533 --> 00:36:05,795
- You ready?
- Yes.

570
00:36:05,968 --> 00:36:07,458
All right, good.

571
00:36:07,636 --> 00:36:09,263
Look excited.

572
00:36:09,805 --> 00:36:10,829
Hey.

573
00:36:11,006 --> 00:36:16,740
"Push," "High," "Boys Don't Cry,"
and "Lullaby," all by the Cure.

574
00:36:18,747 --> 00:36:20,908
Now give me my Zune.

575
00:36:21,851 --> 00:36:23,250
I'm sorry, that's not it.

576
00:36:23,853 --> 00:36:26,253
- All right, I'm sorry. It's okay.
- Get off.

577
00:36:29,024 --> 00:36:30,321
Hey.

578
00:36:30,593 --> 00:36:32,561
Mind if I pick up the slack
you don't want?

579
00:36:32,728 --> 00:36:34,821
- Knock yourself out.
- I will.

580
00:36:36,098 --> 00:36:37,531
God, they're all the same.

581
00:36:38,534 --> 00:36:40,024
But that girl from last night.

582
00:36:40,603 --> 00:36:43,197
- Special.
- Yeah, man, I saw it, man.

583
00:36:43,639 --> 00:36:48,804
I mean, I haven't seen you dance like that
since the 2006 VMAs, remember that night?

584
00:36:48,978 --> 00:36:50,275
It's pretty funky.

585
00:36:50,446 --> 00:36:52,607
So look, we're gonna find her, all right?

586
00:36:53,282 --> 00:36:54,874
She's here somewhere.

587
00:36:55,284 --> 00:36:57,616
I think she helped you
get your mojo back.

588
00:36:57,786 --> 00:37:00,186
Yeah, you're with me.

589
00:37:00,356 --> 00:37:01,948
- Let's do it.
- Who's next?

590
00:37:02,124 --> 00:37:04,649
Come on, ladies, have your songs ready.

591
00:37:04,827 --> 00:37:06,920
Oh, my gosh. He wasn't kidding.

592
00:37:07,096 --> 00:37:10,031
Go down and tell him it was you
before someone starts a riot.

593
00:37:10,199 --> 00:37:11,223
Forget it, Tami.

594
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:14,563
He said last night
was one of the best nights of his life.

595
00:37:14,737 --> 00:37:17,604
- Yeah.
- Until he finds out it was me.

596
00:37:19,708 --> 00:37:22,575
- Are you listening? Come on.
- No. What?

597
00:37:25,748 --> 00:37:27,613
Stop right there.

598
00:37:28,884 --> 00:37:32,376
Oh, look at you, acting all innocent.

599
00:37:32,554 --> 00:37:35,853
- What are you talking about?
- We know, Mary.

600
00:37:36,025 --> 00:37:39,324
- What?
- It was you at the ball. With Joey.

601
00:37:41,096 --> 00:37:43,064
- You guys are crazy.
- No, you're crazy...

602
00:37:43,232 --> 00:37:46,463
...if you think we'll let you end up
with Joey, Miss Stalker Face.

603
00:37:46,635 --> 00:37:49,069
And if you tell him it was you...

604
00:37:49,238 --> 00:37:51,206
...this video will be everywhere.

605
00:37:51,373 --> 00:37:52,840
Hello, YouTube.

606
00:37:53,008 --> 00:37:56,000
You barely know how to work the toaster,
let alone YouTube.

607
00:37:56,178 --> 00:37:58,078
Well, try us.

608
00:37:58,814 --> 00:38:00,839
Now, go make the lamb chops.

609
00:38:01,016 --> 00:38:02,779
Mother's very hungry.

610
00:38:07,423 --> 00:38:08,913
Where are you going?

611
00:38:09,091 --> 00:38:12,527
None of your beeswax. I mean, nowhere.

612
00:38:12,695 --> 00:38:15,687
For a walk. In the woods.

613
00:38:17,032 --> 00:38:18,556
Okay.

614
00:38:19,401 --> 00:38:20,766
Ow! Oh...

615
00:38:24,406 --> 00:38:27,773
If I were a playlist,
where would I hide myself?

616
00:38:36,485 --> 00:38:38,851
In plain sight.

617
00:38:39,021 --> 00:38:40,454
Brilliant.

618
00:38:42,825 --> 00:38:45,885
"We All Fall Down."
"She Wants to Move."

619
00:39:03,345 --> 00:39:08,009
Do you think maybe you could give me
a clue as to what the songs are?

620
00:39:08,617 --> 00:39:10,278
Are they emo?

621
00:39:10,452 --> 00:39:12,113
Techno?

622
00:39:12,554 --> 00:39:13,885
Young contemporary?

623
00:39:14,056 --> 00:39:18,493
Okay, people, people.
Please, disperse, okay?

624
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:19,922
He's gonna take a break...

625
00:39:20,095 --> 00:39:24,156
...and you guys can just come line up
after class or something, all right?

626
00:39:24,333 --> 00:39:27,029
- I'm never gonna find her.
- Hey, hey, hey, mister.

627
00:39:27,202 --> 00:39:30,535
I don't wanna hear that crazy talk.
You leave that in crazy town, okay?

628
00:39:30,706 --> 00:39:34,039
Remember, you're Joey Parker,
and Joey Parker always gets his girl.

629
00:39:34,209 --> 00:39:35,608
I'm right. You know I'm right.

630
00:39:36,011 --> 00:39:38,912
All right, what's your name? Say it, huh?

631
00:39:39,081 --> 00:39:41,242
- I'm...
- Joey Parker.

632
00:39:41,417 --> 00:39:43,783
Your prayers have been answered.

633
00:39:43,952 --> 00:39:45,351
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

634
00:39:46,221 --> 00:39:49,418
Look, Britt, okay?
Joey is on break, okay?

635
00:39:49,591 --> 00:39:50,990
And he's exhausted...

636
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:53,424
Oh, I'm not here to talk to Joey.

637
00:39:53,595 --> 00:39:55,062
I'm in the mood for some funk.

638
00:39:57,166 --> 00:39:59,794
- Really?
- No. Now, get out of my way.

639
00:40:02,337 --> 00:40:05,397
I'm the one.

640
00:40:07,943 --> 00:40:10,070
You're kidding me, right?

641
00:40:10,245 --> 00:40:13,476
I can totally prove it.
I know all the songs on the Zune.

642
00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:15,883
Prove it.

643
00:40:16,618 --> 00:40:20,486
"We All Fall Down," "She Wants to Move,"
"Pon de Replay," and "Hips Don't Lie."

644
00:40:22,524 --> 00:40:23,821
I'm right, right?

645
00:40:24,526 --> 00:40:26,494
I knew it!

646
00:40:26,829 --> 00:40:29,195
Well, what are you waiting for?

647
00:40:29,565 --> 00:40:32,056
- Kiss me.
- No, no, no.

648
00:40:32,234 --> 00:40:33,496
We're gonna dance first.

649
00:40:33,669 --> 00:40:35,432
What?

650
00:40:36,338 --> 00:40:39,068
But you said we only needed
to know the songs.

651
00:40:39,241 --> 00:40:41,869
Plus, I'm not warmed up.
And there's no music.

652
00:40:42,044 --> 00:40:45,172
Well, if you were the one,
you wouldn't need music.

653
00:40:45,347 --> 00:40:47,247
- Sorry, Britt.
- Wait.

654
00:40:48,484 --> 00:40:50,247
I don't need music.

655
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:53,852
I love to dance and sing.

656
00:40:54,022 --> 00:40:55,512
Are you kidding me?

657
00:40:55,991 --> 00:41:00,860
<i>Oh, babe, you want it like that
You want it like this</i>

658
00:41:01,763 --> 00:41:04,197
I just lose control when I'm dancing.

659
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,631
I love it so much.

660
00:41:06,802 --> 00:41:08,269
<i>Oh, baby</i>

661
00:41:09,004 --> 00:41:10,699
Come on.

662
00:41:10,873 --> 00:41:12,738
What is with her?

663
00:41:12,908 --> 00:41:15,376
<i>Like that
You like it like that</i>

664
00:41:16,879 --> 00:41:20,406
How dare they hold that tape against you?
You were 11.

665
00:41:20,582 --> 00:41:24,985
What do I do? I don't want Joey to think
I'm Little Miss Stalker.

666
00:41:25,521 --> 00:41:27,648
You and Joey connected out there.

667
00:41:27,823 --> 00:41:31,122
Even if he sees the tape,
he's not gonna think you're a crazy stalker.

668
00:41:31,293 --> 00:41:33,022
I hope.

669
00:41:34,029 --> 00:41:36,224
I feel nauseous.

670
00:41:36,398 --> 00:41:38,457
- All right, dude?
- Yeah, fine.

671
00:41:44,106 --> 00:41:45,198
Whoa. Um...

672
00:41:45,374 --> 00:41:48,707
- Awkward.
- Ready to meet your mystery girl?

673
00:41:49,311 --> 00:41:51,506
Of course, you know the songs too.

674
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:52,704
God, no.

675
00:41:52,881 --> 00:41:55,076
But I'm the real freaking one.

676
00:41:55,250 --> 00:41:58,549
And I freaking love you
and you just better freaking love me back...

677
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:01,450
...because I'm the freaking one,
you freak.

678
00:42:02,157 --> 00:42:06,150
Way, way, way deep inside...

679
00:42:06,328 --> 00:42:08,262
...I'm sure you're a lovely person.

680
00:42:09,097 --> 00:42:11,088
I can prove I'm the one.

681
00:42:12,868 --> 00:42:14,859
Through dance.

682
00:42:23,212 --> 00:42:24,338
What?

683
00:42:24,513 --> 00:42:29,075
Okay, if this shows up on TMZ,
my attorneys will eat you all for lunch.

684
00:42:29,251 --> 00:42:30,548
Literally.

685
00:42:30,719 --> 00:42:32,550
You should talk to him.

686
00:42:32,721 --> 00:42:35,713
Love can bring any man... Oh, look!

687
00:42:35,891 --> 00:42:38,416
I'll check a couple parties.
I'll call if I get a lead.

688
00:42:38,594 --> 00:42:40,858
It's show time. You can do this.

689
00:42:42,231 --> 00:42:43,255
- I can do it.
- Yeah.

690
00:42:43,432 --> 00:42:44,865
Okay.

691
00:42:45,033 --> 00:42:48,298
- Wait, let's go get some food.
- No.

692
00:42:48,470 --> 00:42:50,631
I'm done with this.
There's no... Ridiculous.

693
00:42:50,806 --> 00:42:52,205
- Joey?
- Yeah.

694
00:42:52,641 --> 00:42:54,506
I have something important to tell you.

695
00:42:54,676 --> 00:42:57,543
- Oh, hey. You work for Dominique, right?
- What?

696
00:42:57,713 --> 00:43:00,045
No, no, that's...

697
00:43:01,083 --> 00:43:03,051
You had shrimp in your hair.

698
00:43:03,852 --> 00:43:07,879
Well, no. No, I mean, yes, that was me,
but that's not what I wanted to tell you.

699
00:43:08,056 --> 00:43:10,547
- Um, I'm...
- Dominique is relentless.

700
00:43:11,526 --> 00:43:13,926
Bree, Britt and now her.

701
00:43:14,896 --> 00:43:18,923
Look, I'm looking for somebody
and I don't have the time right now to talk.

702
00:43:19,101 --> 00:43:20,363
I gotta go, I'm sorry.

703
00:43:21,403 --> 00:43:23,268
But it was nice seeing you.

704
00:43:36,051 --> 00:43:37,518
Yes. Hello? Okay.

705
00:43:37,686 --> 00:43:40,587
Could you please connect me
to the YouTube?

706
00:43:42,224 --> 00:43:43,953
No, you don't understand. I have...

707
00:43:44,126 --> 00:43:47,061
- I told you.
- Oh, my God. He blew you off?

708
00:43:47,696 --> 00:43:50,756
People like me don't belong
with people like him anyway. Whatever.

709
00:43:52,301 --> 00:43:53,859
Damn.

710
00:43:58,106 --> 00:44:01,041
<i>Mary, I need you to
finalize the menu for the girls' party.</i>

711
00:44:01,209 --> 00:44:04,110
<i>And have Dr. Woo move up
my high colonic to this afternoon.</i>

712
00:44:04,279 --> 00:44:05,769
<i>I'm feeling blocked.</i>

713
00:44:05,947 --> 00:44:08,313
<i>Have your sisters' moved up too.</i>

714
00:44:09,584 --> 00:44:12,280
What else do I have to live for?

715
00:44:12,788 --> 00:44:15,518
<i>That's the spirit, sweetie.</i>

716
00:44:21,663 --> 00:44:23,460
<i>Hold on</i>

717
00:44:23,632 --> 00:44:25,623
<i>Then I hear your phone a-ringing</i>

718
00:44:25,801 --> 00:44:29,237
<i>Just waiting for your voice to come on</i>

719
00:44:29,404 --> 00:44:30,769
Come on.

720
00:44:30,939 --> 00:44:33,066
Come on, pay attention to me.
Look at me.

721
00:44:33,241 --> 00:44:34,640
This is a treat for you.

722
00:44:34,810 --> 00:44:37,973
Oh, here. Crab cakes? Anyone?

723
00:44:39,781 --> 00:44:41,942
Hey. What are you doing here?

724
00:44:42,484 --> 00:44:43,849
Oh, I'm here to help.

725
00:44:44,019 --> 00:44:46,078
- I love you.
- I know.

726
00:44:46,254 --> 00:44:49,746
- Here. Start serving there. I'll get the rest.
- Okay.

727
00:44:51,426 --> 00:44:53,690
Hey, bro. Hey, bro.

728
00:44:53,862 --> 00:44:55,454
You want a crab cake?

729
00:44:56,865 --> 00:44:58,799
Yeah, man, the whole school is here.

730
00:44:58,967 --> 00:45:02,630
Just give me 20 minutes,
I'm gonna find your girl, all right?

731
00:45:03,171 --> 00:45:05,036
Gotta call you back.

732
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:08,376
Hey, it's a party. Get off the phone.

733
00:45:10,612 --> 00:45:13,547
- Nice dance moves.
- Oh. Ha-ha-ha.

734
00:45:14,316 --> 00:45:17,911
You know, those purple highlights
look very familiar.

735
00:45:18,086 --> 00:45:22,489
You might not recognize me
without my angel wings of love.

736
00:45:23,125 --> 00:45:24,524
- I'm the Funk.
- The what?

737
00:45:24,693 --> 00:45:26,217
You know, Cupid dance.

738
00:45:26,395 --> 00:45:28,454
You can't forget the Cupid dance.

739
00:45:28,630 --> 00:45:31,224
- Oh, sorry, no. No.
- No?

740
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:33,368
I'm Joey Parker's best friend.

741
00:45:33,535 --> 00:45:35,469
Oh. Is that supposed to impress me?

742
00:45:35,637 --> 00:45:38,800
Ah, you are my mystery girl. I knew it.

743
00:45:38,974 --> 00:45:40,202
Hey, is your friend here?

744
00:45:40,375 --> 00:45:42,400
What, Mary? Yeah, she's here.

745
00:45:42,577 --> 00:45:45,671
Can you go get her? I'm gonna call Joey.
We have to hook them up.

746
00:45:45,847 --> 00:45:46,871
He is in love.

747
00:45:47,048 --> 00:45:49,175
- Seriously? Seriously?
- Yeah. Yeah.

748
00:45:49,351 --> 00:45:52,514
- Awesome, I'll be right back. Okay.
- Okay.

749
00:45:57,125 --> 00:45:58,786
Dustin.

750
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:01,258
- What up?
- Why does it sound like you're frowning?

751
00:46:01,430 --> 00:46:03,625
You better not be frowning.
What did I tell you?

752
00:46:03,799 --> 00:46:05,562
- What's your name?
- We're not playing...

753
00:46:05,734 --> 00:46:07,827
<i>We do it until you cheer up.
What's your name?</i>

754
00:46:08,003 --> 00:46:10,267
- Joey Parker.
- Who keeps it funky?

755
00:46:10,439 --> 00:46:12,430
- Joey Parker.
- Right. And who keeps it real?

756
00:46:12,607 --> 00:46:15,075
<i>- Joey Parker.
- Joey Parker keeps it real, am I right?</i>

757
00:46:15,243 --> 00:46:16,642
You're stupid is what you are.

758
00:46:16,812 --> 00:46:19,940
- Joey Parker, let me hear you screaming.
- I'm in front of her house.

759
00:46:20,115 --> 00:46:21,673
I know, but scream it out loud.

760
00:46:21,850 --> 00:46:24,216
<i>- Joey Parker!
- Joey Parker, that's right. Look.</i>

761
00:46:24,386 --> 00:46:27,753
All evidence indicates that your girl
is in the spot.

762
00:46:27,923 --> 00:46:30,221
<i>- For real?
- Your girl's inside. Come on.</i>

763
00:46:30,392 --> 00:46:31,882
Copy that.

764
00:46:33,028 --> 00:46:35,189
There's my girls, see?

765
00:46:35,764 --> 00:46:37,698
- Yeah.
- Ow!

766
00:46:37,866 --> 00:46:40,300
Chins up. Chins up. Tummies in.

767
00:46:40,469 --> 00:46:42,130
Yes.

768
00:46:44,473 --> 00:46:46,873
- Oh. Happy birthday.
- Thanks.

769
00:46:52,647 --> 00:46:55,946
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Stop right there,
Mr. Man.

770
00:46:56,485 --> 00:46:59,477
I'm the one, Joey Parker.

771
00:46:59,654 --> 00:47:00,712
So let's duet.

772
00:47:01,223 --> 00:47:02,588
You know, duet?

773
00:47:02,757 --> 00:47:04,588
You get it? Duet.

774
00:47:04,759 --> 00:47:06,317
Do a duet with me.

775
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:09,293
Um, not if the human race
depended on it.

776
00:47:09,731 --> 00:47:10,823
Well, that's rude.

777
00:47:10,999 --> 00:47:14,230
Now, I wouldn't do a duet
with you, mister...

778
00:47:14,402 --> 00:47:17,030
...if we were the last two people
alive, okay?

779
00:47:17,205 --> 00:47:19,400
And the world was taken over by apes...

780
00:47:19,574 --> 00:47:22,065
...and we were the only two
with opposable thumbs...

781
00:47:22,244 --> 00:47:24,178
...I still wouldn't.

782
00:47:27,215 --> 00:47:28,239
Crab cakes?

783
00:47:28,416 --> 00:47:29,713
- It's fate.
- What?

784
00:47:29,885 --> 00:47:32,012
He's here. Now's your chance.

785
00:47:32,187 --> 00:47:35,156
I don't know what she's wearing.
I just know that she's here.

786
00:47:35,323 --> 00:47:36,950
I'm a little nervous, man.

787
00:47:37,125 --> 00:47:38,456
Go and talk to him.

788
00:47:38,627 --> 00:47:40,857
- Fine, okay, I'll go.
- Go, go, go.

789
00:47:41,029 --> 00:47:42,326
I hope we find her.

790
00:47:44,499 --> 00:47:45,523
Oh, hey.

791
00:47:46,268 --> 00:47:50,034
- Um... Crab cake?
- Thanks.

792
00:47:50,205 --> 00:47:53,766
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

793
00:47:53,942 --> 00:47:58,174
Have you seen a girl here that can dance
like you've never seen a girl dance before?

794
00:47:58,346 --> 00:48:00,940
Actually, Joey, yes.

795
00:48:03,585 --> 00:48:06,782
<i>- It's funny because you're looking...
MARY I love you so much, Joey.</i>

796
00:48:06,955 --> 00:48:08,684
<i>And you are totally kissable.</i>

797
00:48:10,892 --> 00:48:12,723
<i>This is for you.</i>

798
00:48:20,502 --> 00:48:21,901
This can't be happening.

799
00:48:22,737 --> 00:48:25,570
Is that you?

800
00:48:26,541 --> 00:48:28,941
No, it's okay.

801
00:49:12,020 --> 00:49:14,352
- You guys hear that?
- Yeah.

802
00:49:23,565 --> 00:49:24,589
Uh...

803
00:49:24,766 --> 00:49:26,631
I'll be right back.

804
00:49:38,113 --> 00:49:39,910
You're the one.

805
00:49:48,390 --> 00:49:50,415
I think this is yours.

806
00:49:54,362 --> 00:49:56,523
You tried to tell me at school too...

807
00:49:56,698 --> 00:49:58,791
...and I was a jerk to you.

808
00:50:00,101 --> 00:50:02,626
Wow, you're the one.

809
00:50:02,804 --> 00:50:05,671
I actually found you. This is amazing.

810
00:50:06,775 --> 00:50:08,208
It's cold, huh?

811
00:50:08,376 --> 00:50:09,400
Hey, um...

812
00:50:10,979 --> 00:50:13,447
- No.
- Take my jacket. No, really.

813
00:50:18,086 --> 00:50:20,418
You don't have to pretend
like you like me.

814
00:50:20,588 --> 00:50:22,647
I've had enough charity to last a lifetime.

815
00:50:23,291 --> 00:50:25,919
Who said anything about charity?

816
00:50:26,194 --> 00:50:28,822
I've been going crazy looking for you.

817
00:50:28,997 --> 00:50:30,624
I couldn't stop thinking about you.

818
00:50:31,099 --> 00:50:32,691
The way that we moved together.

819
00:50:34,069 --> 00:50:37,470
Well, my mom was a dancer.
So I guess it's in my blood.

820
00:50:41,976 --> 00:50:45,309
So you really think I'm totally kissable?

821
00:50:45,814 --> 00:50:47,338
What? No, that was...

822
00:50:48,116 --> 00:50:52,678
That was... I was a kid. I didn't... Pff. No.
Ha-ha.

823
00:50:53,121 --> 00:50:55,055
That's too bad. I thought it was cool.

824
00:50:57,459 --> 00:50:58,892
Wow, I...

825
00:50:59,260 --> 00:51:00,887
I know I barely know you...

826
00:51:01,062 --> 00:51:02,552
...but...

827
00:51:03,698 --> 00:51:06,189
Can I...? I wanna take you out, Mary.

828
00:51:07,969 --> 00:51:12,065
Mary, get in here.
- And that's my cue.

829
00:51:14,209 --> 00:51:16,507
Wait, you gonna give me an answer?

830
00:51:17,345 --> 00:51:18,835
Yes.

831
00:51:51,312 --> 00:51:52,506
Joey.

832
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:55,308
Whoa. Hey, Tony Hawk, slow down.
You know you're in a hallway.

833
00:51:55,483 --> 00:51:58,350
Guess who has an audition for
the Academy of Performing Arts.

834
00:51:58,520 --> 00:51:59,612
Me, that's who.

835
00:51:59,788 --> 00:52:02,552
They narrowed the applicants,
500 to 20. I'm in the top 20.

836
00:52:02,724 --> 00:52:05,192
Someone's gonna call, let me know
when my audition is.

837
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:07,692
I'm so close I can feel it.
My gosh, Mary, breathe.

838
00:52:07,862 --> 00:52:10,956
- Breathe. Breathe.
- Mary, that's amazing. That's amazing.

839
00:52:11,132 --> 00:52:14,226
Wow. Hey, you want me to show you
some moves? Uh...

840
00:52:14,402 --> 00:52:16,768
For your audition.
I can help you practice.

841
00:52:16,938 --> 00:52:19,099
I might be into that.

842
00:52:19,407 --> 00:52:20,669
You might be into that?

843
00:52:22,443 --> 00:52:24,104
Meet me tomorrow.

844
00:52:29,684 --> 00:52:30,708
Speak.

845
00:52:30,885 --> 00:52:34,821
Hello. I'm calling from the Manhattan
Academy of Performing Arts...

846
00:52:34,989 --> 00:52:38,390
...regarding an application
for Mary Santiago.

847
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:40,585
I'm her guardian. Talk faster.

848
00:52:41,896 --> 00:52:43,625
We'd like to schedule an audition.

849
00:52:43,798 --> 00:52:46,892
Oh, no, no, no. That won't do.

850
00:52:47,802 --> 00:52:50,202
She can't dance.

851
00:52:50,371 --> 00:52:51,736
She broke both her legs.

852
00:52:54,175 --> 00:52:56,075
Oh, my goodness. That's awful. How?

853
00:52:56,244 --> 00:53:00,180
Well, they're chicken legs
and they were very weak...

854
00:53:00,348 --> 00:53:02,009
...and they just snapped.

855
00:53:02,450 --> 00:53:03,917
<i>Like twigs.</i>

856
00:53:04,085 --> 00:53:06,280
We'd appreciate it
if you didn't call again...

857
00:53:06,454 --> 00:53:12,256
...because, well, it just reminds us
that her dance career is over.

858
00:53:13,494 --> 00:53:15,758
Hey, I'm going clubbing in Vegas
this weekend...

859
00:53:15,930 --> 00:53:18,763
...you wouldn't happen to know
what the weather is like?

860
00:53:20,435 --> 00:53:21,629
Hello?

861
00:53:22,370 --> 00:53:24,167
Hurry up and drive. I'm late.

862
00:53:24,339 --> 00:53:27,900
If I miss this flight, it's your fault,
you nimrod.

863
00:53:29,277 --> 00:53:31,905
Well, there goes the wicked witch
of the west.

864
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:33,479
Maybe she took her broomstick.

865
00:53:33,648 --> 00:53:36,344
- You're off the hook for the weekend.
- Ha-ha-ha. Yeah.

866
00:53:39,721 --> 00:53:41,154
You have to be kidding me.

867
00:53:41,322 --> 00:53:43,381
- She's driving me nuts.
- What is it?

868
00:53:46,794 --> 00:53:48,625
Okay, wow. Um...

869
00:53:48,796 --> 00:53:50,855
"Paint the pool pink.

870
00:53:51,032 --> 00:53:53,227
Regrout the tile.

871
00:53:53,401 --> 00:53:56,928
- Vacuum the driveway"? This is ridiculous.
- Chores from Dominique.

872
00:53:57,105 --> 00:54:00,563
She's gone and I have to do them
or who knows how long she'll ground me.

873
00:54:00,742 --> 00:54:02,141
Sorry, maybe another time.

874
00:54:02,310 --> 00:54:04,778
Unless you do your work
while you do her work.

875
00:55:07,175 --> 00:55:09,040
You're good. You are good, but I...

876
00:55:09,210 --> 00:55:11,770
I think we need to work on your
technique a little bit.

877
00:55:11,946 --> 00:55:12,970
Okay.

878
00:55:15,049 --> 00:55:18,314
Just, you need to loosen up
a little bit more.

879
00:55:19,721 --> 00:55:20,745
Not like that. No.

880
00:55:38,139 --> 00:55:39,163
- isn't so bad.

881
00:55:39,340 --> 00:55:42,332
He's doing all of her work.

882
00:55:42,677 --> 00:55:44,838
I feel very upset right now.

883
00:55:45,146 --> 00:55:46,841
Let's make her repaint the pool?

884
00:55:47,015 --> 00:55:52,078
Let's make her vacuum the driveway?
You're an idiot.

885
00:55:53,054 --> 00:55:54,783
No. What are you doing? No.

886
00:55:54,956 --> 00:55:56,981
What's he see in that little freak show?

887
00:55:57,158 --> 00:55:59,956
Well, I think she's, like,
a good height for him.

888
00:56:00,128 --> 00:56:01,857
- And she has pretty hair...
- Shut up.

889
00:56:04,298 --> 00:56:06,129
We need a plan B.

890
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:15,934
- Uh... I think you need a new guitar.
- Ha.

891
00:56:16,110 --> 00:56:18,101
Yeah, that'd be nice.

892
00:56:20,248 --> 00:56:22,182
You writing a new song?

893
00:56:23,084 --> 00:56:24,108
Yeah.

894
00:56:24,619 --> 00:56:26,849
You, uh, wanna help me
with the harmony?

895
00:56:27,889 --> 00:56:30,357
- No, I...
- I think you wanna help me with harmony.

896
00:56:30,525 --> 00:56:32,390
- Come on.
- Okay.

897
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:34,118
Here.

898
00:56:35,630 --> 00:56:37,894
And this, this is as far as I got
with the lyrics.

899
00:56:38,066 --> 00:56:40,899
- Okay.
- Just start right here.

900
00:56:41,069 --> 00:56:42,400
- You ready?
- Yeah.

901
00:56:42,570 --> 00:56:44,197
Okay.

902
00:56:46,107 --> 00:56:48,701
<i>It's become so hard</i>

903
00:56:48,876 --> 00:56:50,639
<i>- For me to be surprised
- For me to be surprised</i>

904
00:56:50,812 --> 00:56:51,836
That's good.

905
00:56:52,013 --> 00:56:54,777
<i>- But you're bringing back the real me
- But you're bringing back the real me</i>

906
00:56:54,949 --> 00:56:57,417
<i>- No judgment in your eyes
- No judgment in your eyes</i>

907
00:56:57,585 --> 00:57:00,452
<i>- It's the way you make me feel
- It's the way you make me feel</i>

908
00:57:00,621 --> 00:57:05,422
<i>- Like I'm finally something real
- Like I'm finally something real</i>

909
00:57:09,230 --> 00:57:10,390
Okay.

910
00:57:10,865 --> 00:57:12,628
Break time's over.

911
00:57:13,668 --> 00:57:16,136
Back to resting.

912
00:57:24,545 --> 00:57:28,037
You know, one of the reasons I came back
was because I wanted to remember...

913
00:57:28,216 --> 00:57:31,151
...why I started dancing in the first place.

914
00:57:33,988 --> 00:57:36,013
Dancing with you...

915
00:57:36,757 --> 00:57:38,782
...I'm starting to remember.

916
00:57:41,028 --> 00:57:43,019
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

917
00:57:46,567 --> 00:57:48,091
And you're getting closer.

918
00:57:48,269 --> 00:57:49,463
So are you.

919
00:57:49,637 --> 00:57:53,198
- I mean with your moves.
- Well, you're not looking so bad yourself.

920
00:57:53,374 --> 00:57:55,569
Why don't we pick up again tomorrow,
right here?

921
00:57:55,743 --> 00:57:57,973
As in my house, as in this position?

922
00:57:58,146 --> 00:57:59,340
I'm not that kind of guy.

923
00:57:59,514 --> 00:58:02,483
Somehow I don't find that
entirely convincing.

924
00:58:09,891 --> 00:58:12,189
So where's Prince Charming now?

925
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:15,329
Couldn't stand to spend another second
with his charity case?

926
00:58:15,496 --> 00:58:17,396
Wow, jealous much?

927
00:58:18,933 --> 00:58:22,664
Was that the doorbell? That's strange.
I wonder who that could be.

928
00:58:22,837 --> 00:58:25,499
I don't know, Bree.
Get that, would you, Mary?

929
00:58:25,673 --> 00:58:27,140
God, you guys are weird.

930
00:58:30,077 --> 00:58:32,443
Hello, plan B.

931
00:58:32,613 --> 00:58:34,342
Could you be more obvious?

932
00:58:34,515 --> 00:58:37,143
Well, no. That would totally give it away.

933
00:58:53,768 --> 00:58:55,292
Tami, what if he fell asleep?

934
00:58:55,469 --> 00:58:58,165
No way. Go. And call me later.

935
00:58:58,339 --> 00:59:00,705
Domifreak took my cell phone,
remember?

936
00:59:00,875 --> 00:59:02,672
Do you want me to wait?

937
00:59:02,977 --> 00:59:05,810
No, I'm good. Joey will take me home.
Thank you.

938
00:59:05,980 --> 00:59:07,971
- Go kill it.
- Okay.

939
00:59:38,713 --> 00:59:40,305
What was that?

940
00:59:40,748 --> 00:59:42,511
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

941
00:59:42,683 --> 00:59:45,413
Natalia. Natalia, look. Ha.

942
00:59:45,586 --> 00:59:47,986
We had a thing, but it's over.

943
00:59:48,923 --> 00:59:51,915
- Joey. Joey, come on.
- It's time for you to go.

944
00:59:52,093 --> 00:59:53,822
I'll see you at school.

945
01:00:27,895 --> 01:00:30,455
Hey, where have you been all night?

946
01:00:30,631 --> 01:00:33,532
I'm just doing a little yoga.

947
01:00:35,536 --> 01:00:39,404
Hey, have you been crying?
Or are you just naturally puffy?

948
01:00:39,573 --> 01:00:42,041
I never noticed that before.
What's wrong?

949
01:00:42,209 --> 01:00:45,042
- Dominique, I'd rather not talk about it.
- Oh, come on.

950
01:00:45,212 --> 01:00:47,146
Talk to me. Come on, sit down.

951
01:00:47,815 --> 01:00:50,477
Come on, sit down. Come on.

952
01:00:51,185 --> 01:00:52,652
Okay. Sit in the hand.

953
01:00:53,688 --> 01:00:55,747
Is it Joey, honey?

954
01:00:55,923 --> 01:00:58,551
Oh, I knew it.

955
01:00:58,726 --> 01:01:02,059
Did he find someone prettier
and more successful?

956
01:01:02,229 --> 01:01:05,392
Oh, I'm sorry. That is difficult.

957
01:01:05,566 --> 01:01:09,093
Not that I would know, but I did take
an acting class once. I can imagine.

958
01:01:09,970 --> 01:01:14,134
<i>Let me give you a word of advice.
Joey is an E! Hollywood True Story...</i>

959
01:01:14,308 --> 01:01:16,674
...just waiting to happen.

960
01:01:16,844 --> 01:01:19,438
There's no sense crying over him.
Mm-mm.

961
01:01:19,613 --> 01:01:22,104
In fact, it's kind of pathetic.

962
01:01:23,050 --> 01:01:25,518
I can't wait to get out of here
and move to Manhattan.

963
01:01:25,686 --> 01:01:29,087
Oh, I'm sorry. Did I forget to tell you?
I did, my bad.

964
01:01:29,256 --> 01:01:32,248
They called. There's no audition.
It was a mistake.

965
01:01:32,426 --> 01:01:35,259
- What? You're lying.
- No, I'm not.

966
01:01:35,429 --> 01:01:37,829
The rejection letter is right there
in that mess...

967
01:01:37,998 --> 01:01:41,365
...you need to clean up here
and sort through.

968
01:01:44,739 --> 01:01:46,639
I'm so glad we had this little talk.

969
01:01:46,807 --> 01:01:51,244
I've always wanted to be the mother
you'll never have.

970
01:01:54,548 --> 01:01:58,609
Yeah. So the Japan tour was awesome.
Like a Bruce Lee movie, but no subtitles.

971
01:01:58,786 --> 01:02:01,653
- The sushi kind of made me sick...
- Mary.

972
01:02:02,656 --> 01:02:05,056
Hey. Catch you in a minute.

973
01:02:05,226 --> 01:02:06,750
Mary.

974
01:02:07,428 --> 01:02:10,397
Mary, slow down. Hey, what...?

975
01:02:10,564 --> 01:02:11,724
What's wrong?

976
01:02:11,899 --> 01:02:14,424
I've been calling Tami,
trying to get ahold of you.

977
01:02:16,504 --> 01:02:19,166
- What did I do?
- It doesn't matter. It's done. We're done.

978
01:02:20,408 --> 01:02:21,807
Wait.

979
01:02:22,176 --> 01:02:23,666
Whoa, whoa.

980
01:02:23,844 --> 01:02:26,404
- What are you talking about?
- Did you feel sorry for me?

981
01:02:26,580 --> 01:02:29,048
Was I your charity case?
Is that why you asked me out?

982
01:02:29,216 --> 01:02:31,878
- What does that mean?
- You figured you'd toy with me...

983
01:02:32,052 --> 01:02:34,680
...until someone better came along
and I wouldn't mind...

984
01:02:34,855 --> 01:02:36,846
...because I was lucky
a big star wanted me.

985
01:02:37,124 --> 01:02:41,458
You know what really sucks about falling
for a guy you know you're not right for?

986
01:02:42,029 --> 01:02:45,624
You fall anyway because you think
he might turn out to be different.

987
01:02:46,333 --> 01:02:47,766
Mary.

988
01:02:49,737 --> 01:02:51,170
- I am different.
- Anyway...

989
01:02:51,338 --> 01:02:54,000
...thanks for all the dance moves,
but I'm done dancing.

990
01:02:54,175 --> 01:02:55,665
Goodbye.

991
01:02:58,078 --> 01:03:00,342
All right, time for some damage control.

992
01:03:00,514 --> 01:03:03,574
And what'd I tell you? My mystery girl.

993
01:03:08,322 --> 01:03:10,119
- Whoa, Tami.
- I need your help.

994
01:03:10,291 --> 01:03:12,259
- What's with the blinds?
- It's about Mary.

995
01:03:12,426 --> 01:03:15,122
- Come on, girl.
- Don't you "girl" me.

996
01:03:15,896 --> 01:03:18,091
Just give me a second.

997
01:03:18,265 --> 01:03:19,289
One second.

998
01:03:19,467 --> 01:03:22,630
Don't you have a stadium show to play
or something?

999
01:03:22,803 --> 01:03:24,065
Come on. Back door.

1000
01:03:25,873 --> 01:03:27,238
Ah, beat you to it.

1001
01:03:27,408 --> 01:03:29,376
- How about a shiner, superstar?
- Oh, no.

1002
01:03:29,543 --> 01:03:32,706
Won't be no bruising the moneymaker,
okay?

1003
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:36,213
You broke my best friend's heart.
Have a nice life.

1004
01:03:36,383 --> 01:03:39,477
- Tami, I don't even know what I did wrong.
- Let me handle this, JP.

1005
01:03:39,653 --> 01:03:41,712
He doesn't even know
what he did wrong.

1006
01:03:41,889 --> 01:03:43,083
I just said that.

1007
01:03:43,257 --> 01:03:45,225
I know, but it's all about
your intonation.

1008
01:03:45,392 --> 01:03:48,225
Hey. She knows you cheated. Get it?

1009
01:03:48,395 --> 01:03:51,922
- You're done.
- What? That's crazy. And not true.

1010
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:55,398
That's funny, because she saw you
with Natalia.

1011
01:03:57,938 --> 01:03:59,200
Wait a second, hold on.

1012
01:03:59,373 --> 01:04:03,002
So Mary was there
when Natalia broke into your house?

1013
01:04:03,177 --> 01:04:04,701
No. No, nothing happened.

1014
01:04:05,779 --> 01:04:08,475
Natalia busted into my parents' house.
She set me up.

1015
01:04:09,116 --> 01:04:11,311
There's nothing going on between us.

1016
01:04:11,485 --> 01:04:13,419
I would never hurt Mary like that.

1017
01:04:14,221 --> 01:04:15,984
This is insane.
You have to believe me.

1018
01:04:16,156 --> 01:04:19,023
Look, I want to believe you
and I want her to be happy.

1019
01:04:19,193 --> 01:04:21,957
Especially now that she's stuck
with Dominique another year.

1020
01:04:22,129 --> 01:04:24,256
Wait, she didn't get into Manhattan?

1021
01:04:24,431 --> 01:04:27,366
- They didn't give her the audition.
- Oh, my God.

1022
01:04:27,535 --> 01:04:30,834
- Why would they reject her?
- Guess they changed their mind.

1023
01:04:33,874 --> 01:04:35,637
But we can change them back.

1024
01:04:35,809 --> 01:04:37,504
- You can?
- You can?

1025
01:04:38,579 --> 01:04:40,206
What's my name?

1026
01:04:40,381 --> 01:04:42,144
- Joey Parker.
- What's my name?

1027
01:04:42,316 --> 01:04:44,443
Ha. Joey Parker.

1028
01:04:45,653 --> 01:04:47,780
Get Mary to come to the competition,
all right?

1029
01:04:47,955 --> 01:04:49,752
I'll handle it from there.

1030
01:05:05,372 --> 01:05:06,737
Hi.

1031
01:05:06,907 --> 01:05:09,740
- Hi.
- We need to show you something.

1032
01:05:09,910 --> 01:05:12,378
Dustin, what are you doing here?

1033
01:05:13,147 --> 01:05:14,512
Um...

1034
01:05:14,682 --> 01:05:16,172
See, look, Mary.

1035
01:05:16,350 --> 01:05:20,150
Sometimes in relationships, you know,
there could be misunderstandings.

1036
01:05:20,321 --> 01:05:22,482
Bumpy roads and stuff.
But you and JP...

1037
01:05:22,656 --> 01:05:25,124
...like moth to flame,
you keep attracting each other.

1038
01:05:25,292 --> 01:05:27,760
And we, your friends, we see that we...

1039
01:05:27,928 --> 01:05:29,520
You have to trust your friends.

1040
01:05:29,697 --> 01:05:33,258
Please get dressed. Something nice.
It'll be worth it.

1041
01:05:34,635 --> 01:05:36,398
Okay.

1042
01:05:37,838 --> 01:05:40,966
- Do you think she's gonna come?
- Yeah. My lecture was so good.

1043
01:05:41,141 --> 01:05:44,235
Yeah, it was good. It was just kind of long.
You should shorten it.

1044
01:05:44,411 --> 01:05:47,642
- Next time maybe a little bit. A little bit.
- I've been working on it.

1045
01:05:47,815 --> 01:05:49,806
<i>- I've been watching my Dr. Phil.
- Oh, good.</i>

1046
01:05:49,984 --> 01:05:51,542
Great. So weird.

1047
01:06:16,443 --> 01:06:18,877
Ha-ha! Check it out.

1048
01:06:19,046 --> 01:06:20,536
What are you guys doing?

1049
01:06:20,714 --> 01:06:23,911
We felt bad about you not getting
your audition, so we hooked you up.

1050
01:06:24,084 --> 01:06:27,178
- By bringing me to Joey's competition?
- Yeah.

1051
01:06:27,354 --> 01:06:30,255
Mary, this isn't about the competition.

1052
01:06:30,424 --> 01:06:32,892
Tami, I told you, I'm done dancing.

1053
01:06:33,327 --> 01:06:35,625
Trust me.

1054
01:06:37,698 --> 01:06:41,065
Okay. While you contemplate the most
important moment of your life...

1055
01:06:41,235 --> 01:06:44,932
...I'm running late. They need me inside
for the show. So I gotta go, okay?

1056
01:06:47,574 --> 01:06:51,010
All right. I'll go for a second.
But just a second.

1057
01:06:51,178 --> 01:06:52,406
Awesome.

1058
01:06:52,579 --> 01:06:54,103
It's too expensive to valet here.

1059
01:06:54,281 --> 01:06:55,908
- Let's go around the back.
- Oh, God.

1060
01:07:03,691 --> 01:07:06,785
Move. Dominique Blatt coming through.

1061
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:10,396
Sausage-fingered masses. Move.

1062
01:07:10,564 --> 01:07:11,690
Get down. Go, go.

1063
01:07:11,865 --> 01:07:14,629
Sweet roots, blondie. Hey, hey, hey.

1064
01:07:14,802 --> 01:07:16,793
No. Grandpa, up. Up.

1065
01:07:16,970 --> 01:07:18,801
There you go, old man. Move.

1066
01:07:19,206 --> 01:07:23,040
All right, no eye contact, people.
Periphery only.

1067
01:07:24,912 --> 01:07:26,004
What are you looking at?

1068
01:07:26,680 --> 01:07:28,739
Hey, how you doing?
Great. Good to see you.

1069
01:07:31,418 --> 01:07:32,851
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1070
01:07:33,020 --> 01:07:35,011
What's happening?

1071
01:07:36,190 --> 01:07:37,987
Make some noise.

1072
01:07:40,194 --> 01:07:42,526
- How y'all doing tonight?
- Whoo!

1073
01:07:44,064 --> 01:07:45,088
How you doing?

1074
01:07:45,999 --> 01:07:48,900
Are y'all ready to get it popping?

1075
01:07:49,703 --> 01:07:51,227
Oh, no. Um...

1076
01:07:51,405 --> 01:07:52,736
Tami, why don't you sit down?

1077
01:07:52,906 --> 01:07:54,305
I'm gonna hang back. Okay?

1078
01:07:54,475 --> 01:07:56,534
Okay. I'm your host, the Funk.

1079
01:07:56,710 --> 01:07:59,474
I'd like to introduce the man that made
this all possible.

1080
01:07:59,646 --> 01:08:03,742
Give it up for my boy, your boy,
Joey Parker.

1081
01:08:07,521 --> 01:08:09,819
All right. Thanks for coming out
tonight.

1082
01:08:09,990 --> 01:08:12,083
- Whoo!
- Joey! Ha-ha-ha!

1083
01:08:13,594 --> 01:08:15,391
What's up? How y'all doing?

1084
01:08:15,562 --> 01:08:17,189
Hello. Hello. Hello.

1085
01:08:17,364 --> 01:08:19,389
Hey. All right?

1086
01:08:19,566 --> 01:08:21,329
Check it out. I was just backstage.

1087
01:08:21,502 --> 01:08:25,131
We got some ridiculously sick dancers
for you guys tonight.

1088
01:08:25,305 --> 01:08:27,500
Here's how it's gonna work.

1089
01:08:27,674 --> 01:08:32,008
These dancers are gonna be judged on
three things: individuality, skill and style.

1090
01:08:32,179 --> 01:08:34,773
I need you guys to get really loud
and really hyped.

1091
01:08:34,948 --> 01:08:37,610
That's gonna help the judges
from our label pick a winner.

1092
01:08:37,785 --> 01:08:39,753
That winner's gonna dance
in my next video.

1093
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:43,412
- Hi, Dominique Blatt. How are you?
- I'm gonna turn it over to the Funk.

1094
01:08:43,690 --> 01:08:45,157
I'll catch you in a minute.

1095
01:08:45,325 --> 01:08:48,488
All right. All right. Yeah.

1096
01:08:48,662 --> 01:08:52,962
All right. Our first set of dancers go
by the name of Angel and Derek.

1097
01:08:53,133 --> 01:08:56,728
Make some noise for them. DJ, kick that!

1098
01:09:27,935 --> 01:09:31,462
Our next contestant goes by the name
of Taylor. He's gonna give you guys...

1099
01:09:31,638 --> 01:09:33,162
<i>...a little Swan Lake action.</i>

1100
01:09:42,249 --> 01:09:45,685
Hey, boy, ballet's for girls. Ha-ha-ha.

1101
01:09:45,853 --> 01:09:52,224
Now we got the Doctor and Maurice
for some hip-hop dancing. Let's hear it.

1102
01:09:56,697 --> 01:09:57,686
Whoo!

1103
01:10:08,642 --> 01:10:10,109
Boom!

1104
01:10:12,512 --> 01:10:14,776
They're poisoning the minds
of our children...

1105
01:10:14,948 --> 01:10:16,939
...but that is something.
- Okay.

1106
01:10:17,117 --> 01:10:19,176
Cool. Now...

1107
01:10:19,353 --> 01:10:23,016
...the next act goes
by the name of Brittney Blatt.

1108
01:10:23,190 --> 01:10:25,124
And she's doing who knows what.

1109
01:10:28,829 --> 01:10:30,524
There you go, pop it.

1110
01:10:34,768 --> 01:10:36,065
Terrible.

1111
01:10:56,857 --> 01:10:58,757
Oh, that's good. Robot, pop it.

1112
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:01,584
Yeah!

1113
01:11:06,433 --> 01:11:08,901
Did you guys see that?
That was just terrible.

1114
01:11:09,069 --> 01:11:10,730
Thank God that's over. All right.

1115
01:11:10,904 --> 01:11:13,372
We gonna continue this competition,
keep it rolling.

1116
01:11:13,540 --> 01:11:16,031
This is our last dancer of the night,
all right?

1117
01:11:16,677 --> 01:11:21,205
Go ahead and give it up for Natalia Faroush.
Make some noise.

1118
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:34,518
Look, don't regret this.

1119
01:11:34,695 --> 01:11:37,596
You're here. What are you waiting for?

1120
01:12:00,053 --> 01:12:03,022
You're so much better than her.

1121
01:12:11,798 --> 01:12:14,824
Yeah. Give it up for her.

1122
01:12:21,675 --> 01:12:25,611
Come on, now.
- Come on. Come on.

1123
01:12:34,788 --> 01:12:36,983
Yeah, yeah.
It's getting hot in here, right?

1124
01:12:39,826 --> 01:12:41,987
It's getting hot in here. That's right.

1125
01:12:42,162 --> 01:12:46,394
All right. Now it's time that the judges
go ahead and decide who the winner is.

1126
01:12:46,566 --> 01:12:49,091
That was our last dancer of the night.

1127
01:12:51,638 --> 01:12:53,071
What, what? Wait a second.

1128
01:12:53,240 --> 01:12:55,333
What you guys saying?
You guys want some more?

1129
01:12:55,509 --> 01:12:57,204
Yeah.

1130
01:12:58,712 --> 01:13:02,045
Okay. Well, we do have one little special
number for you guys.

1131
01:13:02,215 --> 01:13:03,773
- So check it out.
- Nice.

1132
01:13:03,950 --> 01:13:05,212
You won't believe it.

1133
01:13:19,032 --> 01:13:20,659
Go.

1134
01:13:35,182 --> 01:13:36,479
Whoo!

1135
01:13:42,656 --> 01:13:45,022
Woo-hoo! Whoo!

1136
01:13:47,060 --> 01:13:51,224
Ha-ha. I'm just messing with y'all.
I'm just goofing. That's not it.

1137
01:13:51,398 --> 01:13:52,729
But what's in store...

1138
01:13:52,899 --> 01:13:55,868
...is a lot crazy. Let's go. Let's go.

1139
01:14:48,288 --> 01:14:49,414
Wow.

1140
01:14:49,856 --> 01:14:51,983
- Hey.
- Hey, baby.

1141
01:14:54,561 --> 01:14:58,793
<i>It's become so hard
For me to be surprised</i>

1142
01:14:58,965 --> 01:15:03,595
<i>But you're bringing back the real me
No judgment in your eyes</i>

1143
01:15:03,770 --> 01:15:08,173
<i>It's the way you make me feel
Like I'm finally something real</i>

1144
01:15:08,341 --> 01:15:12,334
<i>The words are hard to find
But I'm gonna get it right this time</i>

1145
01:15:12,913 --> 01:15:17,350
<i>Just come and take my hand
Let me lift you up</i>

1146
01:15:17,517 --> 01:15:21,476
<i>Take away my fear
And make me strong enough</i>

1147
01:15:22,189 --> 01:15:26,683
<i>It's when I dance with you
It's how I speak the truth</i>

1148
01:15:26,860 --> 01:15:32,162
<i>Was just classic when we met
And how you made me move</i>

1149
01:15:32,832 --> 01:15:34,265
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.

1150
01:15:34,434 --> 01:15:36,129
Hold on, guys. Hold on. Hold on.

1151
01:15:36,303 --> 01:15:38,066
Hold on a minute.

1152
01:15:38,905 --> 01:15:40,031
You guys...

1153
01:15:40,207 --> 01:15:41,834
I want this to be perfect.

1154
01:15:43,677 --> 01:15:46,305
It's not gonna be perfect until
I have someone special...

1155
01:15:46,479 --> 01:15:48,140
...standing here right next to me.

1156
01:15:53,853 --> 01:15:55,878
Mary, you out there?

1157
01:15:56,456 --> 01:15:58,014
Mary?

1158
01:15:58,191 --> 01:15:59,385
Did he say Mary?

1159
01:16:02,495 --> 01:16:05,726
Mary, are you here?
I know you're here.

1160
01:16:06,299 --> 01:16:08,824
Where did she go?
- She was right here.

1161
01:16:10,937 --> 01:16:12,234
Mary, come on.

1162
01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:15,601
I know you're out there. Come on.

1163
01:16:24,784 --> 01:16:27,480
<i>Mary, Mary.</i>

1164
01:16:27,654 --> 01:16:30,521
<i>Mary, Mary.</i>

1165
01:16:30,690 --> 01:16:34,387
<i>Mary, Mary, Mary.</i>

1166
01:16:34,561 --> 01:16:35,823
<i>Mary.</i>

1167
01:16:35,996 --> 01:16:38,021
<i>Mary, Mary.</i>

1168
01:16:38,198 --> 01:16:40,689
<i>- Mary, Mary, Mary.
- Dominique. Dominique.</i>

1169
01:16:41,034 --> 01:16:43,332
<i>Mary, Mary.</i>

1170
01:16:43,670 --> 01:16:45,604
<i>- Mary, Mary.
- There she is.</i>

1171
01:16:45,772 --> 01:16:47,399
Hey, Mary.

1172
01:16:51,278 --> 01:16:54,611
- Dance with me.
- Dance with you? No, thanks.

1173
01:16:57,284 --> 01:16:59,718
Well, maybe I'm wrong...

1174
01:17:00,220 --> 01:17:03,189
...but you're the most amazing
dance partner I've ever had.

1175
01:17:03,356 --> 01:17:04,618
Aw...

1176
01:17:05,825 --> 01:17:08,794
Even though I taught her
everything she knows.

1177
01:17:12,599 --> 01:17:16,000
That's funny, because you said
you forgot why you even started dancing...

1178
01:17:16,169 --> 01:17:17,397
...until you met me.

1179
01:17:19,673 --> 01:17:21,265
Burn.

1180
01:17:21,441 --> 01:17:23,102
No, it's okay. It's true.

1181
01:17:24,277 --> 01:17:28,737
So why don't you bring yourself up here
and show me why I remember?

1182
01:17:28,915 --> 01:17:30,940
Yeah.

1183
01:17:32,085 --> 01:17:35,486
Yeah. That's what I'm talking about.
Now this party's heating up.

1184
01:17:35,655 --> 01:17:36,644
Whoo!

1185
01:17:36,823 --> 01:17:38,347
Dominique.

1186
01:17:38,525 --> 01:17:39,549
Shoot.

1187
01:17:39,726 --> 01:17:44,993
Ladies and gentlemen,
Miss Mary Santiago.

1188
01:17:49,602 --> 01:17:53,231
Ooh. I guess I better get out of your way.

1189
01:17:54,074 --> 01:17:57,840
All right. Let's see.
Was it a little boy-band move like this?

1190
01:18:04,417 --> 01:18:05,816
Ooh.

1191
01:18:05,985 --> 01:18:08,180
Okay. Um...

1192
01:18:08,355 --> 01:18:10,448
That was cute. What was it?

1193
01:18:10,990 --> 01:18:12,457
Oh, um, that was you.

1194
01:18:17,564 --> 01:18:20,294
That's not how it goes.
You need some help with that move?

1195
01:18:20,467 --> 01:18:23,402
Like you could have done it any better.

1196
01:18:24,704 --> 01:18:26,365
Really?

1197
01:18:27,407 --> 01:18:29,841
Sweetheart, I invented that move.

1198
01:18:30,009 --> 01:18:31,670
Oh, yeah.

1199
01:18:31,845 --> 01:18:33,904
Well, that's right. I did.

1200
01:18:36,783 --> 01:18:39,809
Prove it. Let's see you keep it real.

1201
01:18:40,820 --> 01:18:43,550
Thank you. Oh, I'm keeping it real.

1202
01:18:54,701 --> 01:18:56,760
- Beat that.
- Well, let's see you top this.

1203
01:18:56,936 --> 01:18:58,870
Give me something with some edge.

1204
01:19:06,579 --> 01:19:08,206
That was cute. Remember this?

1205
01:19:17,991 --> 01:19:19,652
Oh, really?

1206
01:19:23,630 --> 01:19:24,654
Remember this?

1207
01:19:56,229 --> 01:19:58,129
<i>You're the new classic</i>

01:21:14,974 --> 01:21:17,340
<i>- And watch us while we do that
- And watch us while we do that</i>

1241
01:21:26,352 --> 01:21:27,717
Yeah.

1242
01:21:27,887 --> 01:21:29,377
- All right, Mary!
- Yeah.

1243
01:21:29,556 --> 01:21:31,524
You're showing off, Mary.

1244
01:21:31,691 --> 01:21:33,716
Stop showing off.

1245
01:21:53,580 --> 01:21:55,275
All right.

1246
01:21:55,548 --> 01:21:58,881
Thank you. Check it out. I'm gonna let
the judges over there deliberate.

1247
01:21:59,052 --> 01:22:01,077
And I'll be back in five short minutes...

1248
01:22:01,254 --> 01:22:04,155
...with the name of our winner.
Make some noise.

1249
01:22:05,858 --> 01:22:08,224
Mary, you...

1250
01:22:08,394 --> 01:22:10,225
You were amazing.

1251
01:22:11,331 --> 01:22:13,128
So were you.

1252
01:22:14,167 --> 01:22:17,136
No, no. There's nothing going on
between me and Natalia, okay?

1253
01:22:17,303 --> 01:22:20,534
I was ambushed.
I was set up by your stepsisters.

1254
01:22:21,841 --> 01:22:23,536
I would never hurt you like that.

1255
01:22:25,278 --> 01:22:27,576
Believe me, okay?

1256
01:22:27,981 --> 01:22:30,381
And no matter what they do...

1257
01:22:32,285 --> 01:22:34,378
...we were meant to be together.

1258
01:22:44,497 --> 01:22:47,398
- I believe you.
- Good. Because I'm totally kissable.

1259
01:22:57,076 --> 01:22:58,100
That's my cue.

1260
01:22:58,878 --> 01:23:01,142
- Go.
- Okay.

1261
01:23:04,584 --> 01:23:06,609
Everybody still here?

1262
01:23:06,819 --> 01:23:09,117
No, no, no, I can't hear you. Come on.

1263
01:23:14,027 --> 01:23:17,963
Everybody that came out tonight, dancers.
Thank you so much. You're amazing.

1264
01:23:18,131 --> 01:23:20,156
I love you.

1265
01:23:20,733 --> 01:23:24,567
But there can only be one winner.
I have that name in my hand. Here we go.

1266
01:23:25,104 --> 01:23:27,368
The winner of the competition...

1267
01:23:28,074 --> 01:23:29,507
...is...

1268
01:23:30,710 --> 01:23:34,111
- Oh, my God. Mary Santiago.
- What?

1269
01:23:37,750 --> 01:23:39,775
Everybody give it up.

1270
01:23:41,454 --> 01:23:43,285
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1271
01:23:47,126 --> 01:23:49,253
No, it's fixed. What, you rig it, Mary?

1272
01:23:51,998 --> 01:23:53,090
La-la-la.

1273
01:23:53,433 --> 01:23:55,628
- You're amazing.
- Hey.

1274
01:23:55,802 --> 01:23:58,293
This isn't fair. I deserve this award.

1275
01:24:00,707 --> 01:24:02,698
But you were really good, Mary.

1276
01:24:04,610 --> 01:24:06,373
Hey.
- Aah!

1277
01:24:07,346 --> 01:24:09,280
Congratulations.

1278
01:24:09,449 --> 01:24:12,077
Look, hey, those moves were so
redonkulous, Mary.

1279
01:24:12,251 --> 01:24:14,310
And I have to say, Joey,
as your manager...

1280
01:24:14,487 --> 01:24:17,547
...I have to say
I think you got your swagger back.

1281
01:24:17,724 --> 01:24:19,214
Move it.
- Oh.

1282
01:24:19,392 --> 01:24:21,223
How dare you?

1283
01:24:21,861 --> 01:24:26,491
How dare you embarrass me
and your sisters?

1284
01:24:26,666 --> 01:24:29,658
How do you think
this makes us look, huh?

1285
01:24:30,069 --> 01:24:33,561
You, our maid,
wins the Joey Parker competition?

1286
01:24:33,740 --> 01:24:39,872
You have humiliated us in front
of the entire Los Angeles metropolitan area.

1287
01:24:41,080 --> 01:24:43,708
Miss Santiago?
My name is Regina Cretikos.

1288
01:24:43,883 --> 01:24:45,475
I'm with the Manhattan Academy.

1289
01:24:46,486 --> 01:24:50,183
You danced spectacularly well
for someone with two broken legs.

1290
01:24:51,991 --> 01:24:55,188
Wait. What do you mean,
two broken legs?

1291
01:24:55,361 --> 01:24:56,623
Don't look at me like that.

1292
01:24:56,796 --> 01:24:59,663
We'll talk about this later.
Don't you pull that face with me.

1293
01:24:59,832 --> 01:25:01,595
Girls, come with me.

1294
01:25:11,511 --> 01:25:12,910
Anyway...

1295
01:25:13,079 --> 01:25:15,877
...we would be honored
if you would come study with us.

1296
01:25:16,048 --> 01:25:19,540
- Full scholarship. Call me on Monday.
- Oh, my God.

1297
01:25:20,119 --> 01:25:22,280
It worked, man.

1298
01:25:29,428 --> 01:25:32,955
Britt? I seem to have broken things.

1299
01:25:35,768 --> 01:25:36,757
Hello?

1300
01:25:37,036 --> 01:25:38,628
Call me every day, okay?

1301
01:25:38,805 --> 01:25:41,239
I don't know if I can handle senior year
without you.

1302
01:25:41,407 --> 01:25:43,898
Give it a few months,
you'll pick me up in your jet.

1303
01:25:44,076 --> 01:25:45,976
- And we'll go shopping in Paris.
- Okay.

1304
01:25:46,145 --> 01:25:47,908
I need my meds.

1305
01:25:48,080 --> 01:25:50,776
P-R-O-N-T-O, pronto.

1306
01:25:50,950 --> 01:25:53,578
Mary, did you hear me?

1307
01:25:53,753 --> 01:25:56,415
Not the OxoCollon, that's for breakfast.

1308
01:25:56,589 --> 01:25:58,989
I need my morphine, it's lunch time.

1309
01:25:59,158 --> 01:26:01,023
Mary. Come on.

1310
01:26:01,194 --> 01:26:03,822
Mary. A little help here, please.

1311
01:26:05,565 --> 01:26:08,159
Sorry, Dominique.
I don't work for you anymore.

1312
01:26:08,935 --> 01:26:10,960
- Oh, come on.
- Hey.

1313
01:26:11,137 --> 01:26:15,335
Mary, aren't we BFFFFs or...?
Isn't that what the kids say?

1314
01:26:15,508 --> 01:26:17,772
I can't believe all my dreams
are coming true.

1315
01:26:17,944 --> 01:26:19,605
I know I can be a witch.

1316
01:26:19,779 --> 01:26:21,474
You shouldn't be so sensitive.

1317
01:26:21,647 --> 01:26:23,911
Don't you dare get in that van, Mary.

1318
01:26:24,283 --> 01:26:25,341
Mary?

1319
01:26:25,518 --> 01:26:28,510
Mary, don't leave me with these people.

1320
01:26:28,688 --> 01:26:30,952
Don't be my frienemy!

1321
01:26:33,292 --> 01:26:35,624
Oh, I'm feeling something.

1322
01:26:36,062 --> 01:26:38,007
I'm feeling
abandoned.

1323
01:26:49,008 --> 01:26:50,032
Shh.

1324
01:32:00,886 --> 01:32:02,877
