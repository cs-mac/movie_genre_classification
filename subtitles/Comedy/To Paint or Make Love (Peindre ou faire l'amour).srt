1
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:25,764
Yes, Bernard.

2
00:00:26,726 --> 00:00:29,866
Exactly.
A painter without a ladder is like...

3
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:32,273
Or a baker without sugar.

4
00:00:34,267 --> 00:00:36,247
Take Pablo's.

5
00:00:36,403 --> 00:00:39,907
The facade will be done by tonight.
The scaffolding's back.

6
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:43,346
I'll talk to them
about colors inside.

7
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,553
Okay, thanks, Bernard.

8
00:00:45,912 --> 00:00:47,619
Goodbye. See you tomorrow.

9
00:01:22,315 --> 00:01:25,353
To Paint or Make Love

10
00:02:31,851 --> 00:02:32,921
Who's painting?

11
00:02:35,788 --> 00:02:36,960
Good day, sir.

12
00:02:40,727 --> 00:02:42,104
It's a woman.

13
00:02:43,696 --> 00:02:46,233
- She's the painter?
- Yes.

14
00:02:46,566 --> 00:02:47,704
At last!

15
00:02:52,038 --> 00:02:53,278
Where are you?

16
00:02:54,107 --> 00:02:55,108
Here.

17
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:58,322
Speak to me!
The air is whirling.

18
00:02:58,978 --> 00:03:00,013
I'm here.

19
00:03:09,956 --> 00:03:11,731
Sorry I called you sir.

20
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:15,168
The smell of paint
covered your fragrance.

21
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:16,636
It doesn't matter.

22
00:03:18,097 --> 00:03:19,167
Are you lost?

23
00:03:19,632 --> 00:03:22,044
No, not at all. Don't worry.

24
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:26,616
I often come here.
It's on my route.

25
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:32,589
It's only here,

26
00:03:32,745 --> 00:03:34,691
exactly where we are,

27
00:03:34,847 --> 00:03:36,884
that I can make out shapes.

28
00:03:38,084 --> 00:03:39,062
Shapes?

29
00:03:39,652 --> 00:03:43,862
Yes, shapes,
like currents of colored air.

30
00:03:44,023 --> 00:03:46,765
Yellow, orange, rust.

31
00:03:48,094 --> 00:03:49,334
They're like...

32
00:03:49,963 --> 00:03:51,033
Flames?

33
00:03:51,831 --> 00:03:54,903
Flames, yes,
but comforting flames.

34
00:03:55,835 --> 00:03:57,974
Like a volcano but...

35
00:03:59,005 --> 00:04:01,383
without the sulfur or eruptions.

36
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:03,244
A very gentle volcano.

37
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:04,983
A breeze

38
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:07,782
that's warm and silent.

39
00:04:10,783 --> 00:04:12,888
Just the wind in the leaves.

40
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:20,830
Yes, of course
but I'm only an amateur.

41
00:04:21,227 --> 00:04:23,707
I paint landscapes to get fresh air

42
00:04:23,863 --> 00:04:26,104
and wind down after work.

43
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:29,043
Am I bothering you?
I can move away.

44
00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:30,647
No, not at all.

45
00:04:48,054 --> 00:04:51,194
Is the house at the end of the field
in your painting?

46
00:04:52,892 --> 00:04:54,269
No, but...

47
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:56,573
Let's go visit. It's for sale.

48
00:04:56,963 --> 00:05:00,968
I'm the mayor of the village.
I know where the key is.

49
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:03,271
It will only take a few minutes.

50
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,129
Do you mind guiding me?

51
00:05:21,187 --> 00:05:23,326
We'll step into your painting.

52
00:05:27,226 --> 00:05:28,705
My name is Adam.

53
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,164
Madeleine.

54
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:35,845
Home ownership is an emotion too.

55
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:45,217
Madeleine, it's me again.
Everyone's waiting.

56
00:05:45,445 --> 00:05:47,789
I don't know what's for dinner.

57
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:50,619
I'll serve drinks.

58
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:01,434
These winding roads
are dangerous at nightfall.

59
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:03,866
The deer are out. They cross.

60
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,873
Bang! It happens in no time.

61
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:08,911
- Retirement anxiety?
- Early retirement.

62
00:06:09,168 --> 00:06:10,374
It's not easy.

63
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:13,115
Weather is a real passion,
not just a job.

64
00:06:13,272 --> 00:06:14,273
I know.

65
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:17,080
It took me time
to forget teaching and mathematics.

66
00:06:17,243 --> 00:06:18,688
Then one day,

67
00:06:18,845 --> 00:06:22,816
you realize there are
more exciting things in a man's life.

68
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,923
I feel completely useless.

69
00:06:28,688 --> 00:06:31,692
Elise called me this afternoon,
for two seconds,

70
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:34,532
to say she got
an architecture residency

71
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:37,265
at the Villa... something, in Italy.

72
00:06:37,597 --> 00:06:38,632
The Villa Medicis.

73
00:06:39,198 --> 00:06:41,200
What an opportunity
for your daughter.

74
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:42,842
Yes but...

75
00:06:43,002 --> 00:06:45,983
she's never traveled.
We won't see her anymore.

76
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:48,676
In Rome! That's fantastic.

77
00:06:48,841 --> 00:06:50,582
You two will be able to visit.

78
00:06:55,314 --> 00:06:57,590
Where's Madeleine?
It's almost dark.

79
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:09,797
Dear William, you don't know
what happiness awaits.

80
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:14,769
All that free time still scares you
because it's so new.

81
00:07:15,868 --> 00:07:19,315
The eternal vacation
you dreamed of as a kid...

82
00:07:19,672 --> 00:07:20,673
Don't deny it.

83
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:22,651
It's yours at last.

84
00:07:22,975 --> 00:07:25,285
You mean the last stretch before...

85
00:07:28,181 --> 00:07:30,183
For your outfit, drop by the store.

86
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:32,090
It's a wonderful sport.

87
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:35,929
- About time!
- Hello, everyone.

88
00:07:36,088 --> 00:07:38,625
Why are you sitting in the dark?

89
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,896
- You're getting mud everywhere.
- Sorry!

90
00:07:44,263 --> 00:07:45,833
Fresh country air!

91
00:07:46,098 --> 00:07:49,739
At sunset, a cool breeze sets in.
It's so invigorating.

92
00:07:49,902 --> 00:07:53,816
It's amazing how many wild animals
you see at nightfall.

93
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:57,687
William, didn't you reheat
the rabbit stew?

94
00:07:57,844 --> 00:07:59,050
I completely forgot.

95
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:01,214
Let's eat. I'll get the boar pate.

96
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:02,586
Let's eat.

97
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:05,026
Who'll get me a glass of port?

98
00:09:20,826 --> 00:09:22,066
Smoking again?

99
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:23,873
No.

100
00:09:29,502 --> 00:09:31,379
You're lacking magnesium.

101
00:09:31,704 --> 00:09:32,774
Maybe.

102
00:09:35,007 --> 00:09:37,453
Now I don't work,
I have nothing to tell you.

103
00:09:39,045 --> 00:09:40,149
Let's take a walk.

104
00:09:41,013 --> 00:09:41,991
Now?

105
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:43,684
You're free, aren't you?

106
00:10:12,178 --> 00:10:13,282
What do you think?

107
00:10:32,164 --> 00:10:35,373
The advantages of the country:
calm, charm and beauty,

108
00:10:35,701 --> 00:10:37,180
without the isolation.

109
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:40,216
Unfortunately, Ma'am,
walnut orchards

110
00:10:40,373 --> 00:10:42,785
are renowned for being damp.

111
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:46,718
Cool in summer.

112
00:10:51,117 --> 00:10:56,191
This magnificent walnut drier
is sold with the farmhouse.

113
00:11:18,377 --> 00:11:20,983
Home ownership is an emotion too.

114
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:43,843
It's exactly the aspect you want:

115
00:11:44,003 --> 00:11:48,713
facing sunrise at dusk
and the Vercors sunset at night.

116
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:50,012
How much is it?

117
00:11:50,176 --> 00:11:51,985
140,000, agency fees included.

118
00:11:52,144 --> 00:11:55,853
Double with renovations.
For an old retired bachelor...

119
00:11:56,015 --> 00:11:58,359
Old! Come now, Mr. Lassere.

120
00:11:58,517 --> 00:12:01,760
Many women find you attractive.
Take me for example.

121
00:12:03,355 --> 00:12:05,767
I've wanted you from day one.

122
00:12:13,265 --> 00:12:14,266
Come here.

123
00:12:55,975 --> 00:12:57,784
I don't know what got into me.

124
00:12:57,943 --> 00:13:00,150
Not at all. It's been a long time.

125
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:06,120
Ready? I have to get going.

126
00:13:06,318 --> 00:13:07,388
I'll take it.

127
00:13:07,887 --> 00:13:10,925
- What?
- The house. We're buying it.

128
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:12,467
It is for sale?

129
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:14,397
You're not rushing it?

130
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,403
- Who's selling?
- I don't know.

131
00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:20,169
I met the village mayor by chance.
He told me.

132
00:13:20,332 --> 00:13:23,245
Okay. You can go back.
I'll work it out.

133
00:13:23,402 --> 00:13:25,404
I have time. A whole lifetime.

134
00:13:28,607 --> 00:13:31,019
Don't worry. Everything's fine.

135
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:33,957
See you tonight, darling.

136
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,527
Got your cell phone?

137
00:13:45,457 --> 00:13:47,562
- You'll call me?
- I'll call you.

138
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:44,058
Hello, Elise? It's Dad.

139
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:47,530
I have some big news too.

140
00:15:04,837 --> 00:15:06,373
There are...

141
00:15:07,773 --> 00:15:10,913
There are snowfalls in Kergellen

142
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:15,057
The coral in Vanua Levou

143
00:15:15,447 --> 00:15:17,449
The "Hello, how are you?"

144
00:15:17,616 --> 00:15:21,655
There are worries and heartaches

145
00:15:21,887 --> 00:15:24,424
Religions and gurus

146
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:28,098
Big questions that are taboo

147
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:30,873
You can see that man is mad

148
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:36,642
Mad like someone in love

149
00:15:48,647 --> 00:15:49,717
There are...

150
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:52,686
There are Indians and totems

151
00:15:52,851 --> 00:15:55,559
Rocky mountains and gold diggers

152
00:15:55,721 --> 00:15:58,133
Travelers and meteors

153
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:00,960
There are the secrets of poems

154
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:03,629
A hundred thousand other treasures

155
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:05,400
Like evening or daybreak

156
00:16:06,231 --> 00:16:08,711
You can see he ignores them all

157
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:13,980
For he knows that Jessie loves him

158
00:16:20,245 --> 00:16:21,656
Goodbye.

159
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:25,722
Have a nice weekend.

160
00:16:49,575 --> 00:16:50,986
Perfect timing, darling.

161
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:55,917
Light mist, mild autumn, rising sap,

162
00:16:56,248 --> 00:16:58,694
first night in dream home,

163
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:01,457
starlit dinner with new friends...

164
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,600
What dinner? Grass clippings?

165
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:05,235
Roast roasting.

166
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:10,737
Time for gardening together
in new room.

167
00:17:21,006 --> 00:17:21,916
Adam!

168
00:17:22,074 --> 00:17:23,212
Don't move!

169
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:27,884
Sorry, I didn't warn you.
I planted it yesterday.

170
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,254
My fault. I should have smelt it.

171
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:32,291
It seems magnificent.

172
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:34,097
Or sturdy at least.

173
00:17:34,753 --> 00:17:37,131
And its fragrance
is as delicate as yours.

174
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:38,597
Hello, Adam.

175
00:17:44,863 --> 00:17:47,400
That must be... Eva.

176
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:48,711
Eva?

177
00:17:48,967 --> 00:17:51,607
My wife's name is Eva.
I didn't tell you?

178
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:52,840
No.

179
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:02,120
I know what people
are like in the valley.

180
00:18:02,614 --> 00:18:04,525
How could they elect you?

181
00:18:05,984 --> 00:18:06,894
Close your eyes.

182
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:12,291
Done.

183
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:27,581
See how dependent you are
when you live in the dark.

184
00:18:28,073 --> 00:18:29,484
Absolutely.

185
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:34,155
They asked me to run for office.
I was elected.

186
00:18:34,313 --> 00:18:38,489
I realized nobody dared lie to me.

187
00:18:39,218 --> 00:18:43,963
They assumed I had the power
to read everyone's mind

188
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:45,734
like an open book.

189
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:56,943
Look, William's running off.
He's hiding something.

190
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:00,611
Not at all.
I'm getting the roast.

191
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:55,831
We're out of wine.

192
00:19:56,795 --> 00:19:57,739
I love you.

193
00:19:57,896 --> 00:19:58,897
I love you.

194
00:20:06,071 --> 00:20:08,415
It's as mild as it is in June.

195
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:12,344
We called it an Indian summer
in my weather days.

196
00:20:13,278 --> 00:20:17,055
We should let you
enjoy your first night here.

197
00:20:18,016 --> 00:20:19,757
I have something for you.

198
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:25,865
It's a surprise for me too.

199
00:20:49,014 --> 00:20:49,992
Here.

200
00:20:53,652 --> 00:20:55,689
It's the painting I started

201
00:20:56,688 --> 00:20:59,362
when we met the first time
in the field.

202
00:21:01,627 --> 00:21:03,903
Eva will describe it better than me.

203
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:06,007
If you like it, it's yours.

204
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:12,180
This enchanted evening
must have been under its spell.

205
00:21:12,504 --> 00:21:14,780
We like it very much already.

206
00:21:16,642 --> 00:21:20,249
- Does it have a title?
- I don't know...

207
00:21:20,412 --> 00:21:21,914
"Sun going down on..."

208
00:21:22,247 --> 00:21:24,921
Or maybe
"Sunset over the Vercors"!

209
00:21:35,394 --> 00:21:36,930
I think they're very lonely.

210
00:21:39,665 --> 00:21:41,804
I feel so small.

211
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:44,204
I feel proud.

212
00:21:48,607 --> 00:21:50,553
It's full of new sounds.

213
00:21:51,943 --> 00:21:54,253
- Time for bed?
- Yes.

214
00:22:29,915 --> 00:22:31,553
I think I have an idea.

215
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:41,602
Hello.

216
00:22:47,966 --> 00:22:49,775
I don't want to bother you.

217
00:22:50,769 --> 00:22:53,807
I came to invite you
to dinner tonight.

218
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:56,815
Why not? Yes, we'd love to.

219
00:22:56,975 --> 00:22:57,953
See you tonight.

220
00:22:58,410 --> 00:22:59,980
I'm going to the village.

221
00:23:05,283 --> 00:23:07,593
He's always flat out
at the weekend.

222
00:23:09,421 --> 00:23:11,059
I like your painting a lot.

223
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:12,801
Really? Thanks.

224
00:23:14,626 --> 00:23:17,800
I felt embarrassed.
I painted it so fast

225
00:23:17,963 --> 00:23:19,704
and I didn't touch it up.

226
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,839
I'd like you to do my portrait.

227
00:23:24,503 --> 00:23:28,451
I'm flattered but I'm not sure I can.
I've never done it.

228
00:23:28,607 --> 00:23:30,883
I've never posed.
We'll improvise.

229
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:37,893
Okay, why not?

230
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:40,530
- Can we try?
- Now?

231
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:44,492
Okay then.

232
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:46,402
This way.

233
00:24:18,723 --> 00:24:19,701
Here?

234
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:21,799
Fine.

235
00:25:09,474 --> 00:25:10,782
I'm diving in.

236
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:26,468
It's been so long
since anyone saw me.

237
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,449
- Do you like...
- Who?

238
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:45,779
The cart.

239
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:19,612
Welcome.

240
00:26:20,645 --> 00:26:21,589
Hello.

241
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,759
- How are you?
- Fine.

242
00:26:24,115 --> 00:26:25,924
Go ahead. Step inside.

243
00:26:31,957 --> 00:26:34,233
The last six months
have been intense.

244
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:37,938
But it's strange.
I feel I lived them in reverse.

245
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:40,372
Like I'm ten years younger.

246
00:26:41,533 --> 00:26:43,843
What were you doing
ten years ago?

247
00:26:48,473 --> 00:26:50,009
The cold snaps of '95.

248
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:57,559
Another Glenfiddich?

249
00:26:57,716 --> 00:26:58,694
Yes, please.

250
00:27:26,778 --> 00:27:31,750
Are you happy with the spot
where we hung your painting?

251
00:27:33,785 --> 00:27:34,889
It's embarrassing...

252
00:27:38,023 --> 00:27:39,024
Sorry!

253
00:27:40,458 --> 00:27:43,132
Nonetheless,
the true value of a work of art

254
00:27:43,461 --> 00:27:46,374
lies in the atmosphere
that develops around it.

255
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:50,438
Your sunset in our bedroom

256
00:27:50,602 --> 00:27:53,014
will have an interesting influence

257
00:27:53,705 --> 00:27:54,809
on our nights.

258
00:27:58,977 --> 00:28:02,720
What do you want to drink
after all this excitement?

259
00:28:05,817 --> 00:28:06,955
A glass of port.

260
00:28:08,086 --> 00:28:12,535
There are a few caves
painted in prehistoric times

261
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:14,967
where there is no trace of fire

262
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:16,996
and no light source.

263
00:28:17,595 --> 00:28:18,733
They painted...

264
00:28:19,397 --> 00:28:20,637
We painted

265
00:28:20,832 --> 00:28:24,871
at that time and in certain places,
in complete darkness.

266
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:29,511
They never saw
the shapes we see now in the caves.

267
00:28:29,674 --> 00:28:31,415
They caressed them.

268
00:28:32,277 --> 00:28:36,248
These paintings
are invisible sculptures,

269
00:28:36,848 --> 00:28:38,885
like everything around me.

270
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:44,265
When I was a student,
I worked as a guide in a cave.

271
00:28:44,656 --> 00:28:46,727
A man visited regularly.

272
00:28:47,525 --> 00:28:48,970
He had lost his sight.

273
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:53,531
He didn't know my name
but I learned his: Adam.

274
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:58,536
He asked me to describe
the shapes of the bears.

275
00:29:01,106 --> 00:29:06,351
The women's genitals,
the men running after their arrows.

276
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:12,391
Once, after a visit, for fun,
I asked him to describe me.

277
00:29:12,984 --> 00:29:15,590
He described a naked belly dancer.

278
00:29:17,489 --> 00:29:20,026
I decided to become
his invisible wife.

279
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:26,803
I often feel I see
through Eva's eyes.

280
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:29,335
Like when you're in love.

281
00:29:42,714 --> 00:29:43,692
Do you mind?

282
00:29:44,149 --> 00:29:45,492
Go ahead.

283
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:12,682
You have it?

284
00:30:13,411 --> 00:30:15,652
It was playing when we first met.

285
00:31:22,981 --> 00:31:24,358
Good night.

286
00:31:26,417 --> 00:31:28,397
Sorry, I forgot the flashlight.

287
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:32,432
Could you lend us one?

288
00:31:32,991 --> 00:31:36,336
We haven't owned a flashlight
for ages.

289
00:31:38,029 --> 00:31:39,804
I'll give you a lift.

290
00:31:40,365 --> 00:31:41,708
It's okay, Eva.

291
00:31:43,101 --> 00:31:45,342
It takes no time through the forest.

292
00:31:50,174 --> 00:31:51,881
Let's go.

293
00:31:52,477 --> 00:31:55,356
Give me your hand, Madeleine.
Take William's.

294
00:32:05,723 --> 00:32:06,997
I'll be back soon.

295
00:32:10,495 --> 00:32:11,530
Are you sure?

296
00:32:19,037 --> 00:32:21,574
Hear the stream on your right?

297
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:24,014
Yes.

298
00:32:25,743 --> 00:32:29,020
For 120 steps,
you keep it by your right ear.

299
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:31,116
- Everything okay?
- Yes.

300
00:32:34,085 --> 00:32:36,031
Feel the different breeze?

301
00:32:36,487 --> 00:32:37,795
Very clearly.

302
00:32:40,525 --> 00:32:43,904
Now we take a left.

303
00:32:45,663 --> 00:32:47,108
We'll soon feel grass...

304
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,840
What's that?

305
00:32:51,703 --> 00:32:54,912
A wild boar.
We're walking against the wind.

306
00:32:56,741 --> 00:32:57,947
- Where are you?
- Come to me.

307
00:32:58,109 --> 00:32:59,679
Nothing's in your way.

308
00:33:02,013 --> 00:33:04,050
Come to me.
Nothing's in your way.

309
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:09,222
There's Madeleine's hand.
No, it's William's.

310
00:33:16,861 --> 00:33:18,033
Let's go.

311
00:33:18,463 --> 00:33:20,807
It goes downhill but not for long.

312
00:33:27,238 --> 00:33:28,842
Knees up.

313
00:33:30,108 --> 00:33:32,554
We're going over a dead tree.

314
00:33:38,583 --> 00:33:40,062
Recognize the grass?

315
00:33:40,952 --> 00:33:42,625
It's the sunset field.

316
00:33:43,287 --> 00:33:44,265
Is it?

317
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:47,460
Your field, Madeleine.

318
00:33:49,127 --> 00:33:51,505
Here's the rosebush. You're home.

319
00:33:51,662 --> 00:33:52,640
Do you think?

320
00:33:52,797 --> 00:33:54,470
So, if we're home,

321
00:33:54,632 --> 00:33:58,671
the light must be...

322
00:34:01,239 --> 00:34:02,274
here!

323
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:08,080
Thanks a lot, Adam.

324
00:34:08,279 --> 00:34:10,623
I'll be going. Good night.

325
00:34:10,782 --> 00:34:13,285
Will you be okay?
I'll drive you home.

326
00:34:13,618 --> 00:34:14,824
Don't worry.

327
00:34:20,191 --> 00:34:21,727
What is it?

328
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:23,167
A cart.

329
00:34:23,995 --> 00:34:25,770
Very nice.

330
00:35:12,844 --> 00:35:13,879
My God!

331
00:35:24,222 --> 00:35:25,895
See, it's at their place.

332
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:40,782
It's us!

333
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:47,387
I was so scared!

334
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:51,157
Come on. Don't stay here.

335
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:56,294
How did it happen?

336
00:35:56,687 --> 00:35:58,997
I don't get it.
I didn't smell a thing.

337
00:36:34,325 --> 00:36:36,202
Wow, they look great!

338
00:36:41,098 --> 00:36:43,078
So, what are you up to?

339
00:36:43,434 --> 00:36:45,812
We haven't heard
since you moved.

340
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:47,313
You look radiant.

341
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:50,318
Look at you.

342
00:36:51,309 --> 00:36:54,153
- You've toned up.
- It's the gardening.

343
00:36:55,279 --> 00:36:56,849
- Smoking again?
- No.

344
00:36:57,181 --> 00:36:59,627
How's the new life coming along?

345
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:01,621
It's wonderful!

346
00:37:03,421 --> 00:37:06,664
They live at your place?
The council couldn't help?

347
00:37:07,491 --> 00:37:08,868
It must be hard work.

348
00:37:09,193 --> 00:37:11,230
No, it's going really well.

349
00:37:12,496 --> 00:37:13,566
How long's it for?

350
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:17,076
We asked Adam and Eva
to move in with us.

351
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:19,340
All that's left is four black walls.

352
00:37:19,503 --> 00:37:22,143
Furniture, books, clothes.
Up in smoke.

353
00:37:22,306 --> 00:37:25,310
Imagine losing
your whole history in a few hours.

354
00:37:25,476 --> 00:37:28,719
They were literally
stripped bare overnight.

355
00:37:29,113 --> 00:37:31,787
How long will it take
to make sense of it?

356
00:37:32,116 --> 00:37:36,189
They don't know and nor do we
but we'll be there until they do.

357
00:37:41,525 --> 00:37:44,301
How's Elise?
Everything okay in Rome?

358
00:37:44,462 --> 00:37:46,464
No news is good news.

359
00:37:48,699 --> 00:37:51,737
Can we start playing?
I said I'd be back early.

360
00:37:52,236 --> 00:37:53,271
No coffee?

361
00:37:53,571 --> 00:37:55,175
He's motivated for once.

362
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:57,551
You're picking me up?

363
00:37:58,476 --> 00:37:59,887
Tonight at 7 o'clock.

364
00:38:01,345 --> 00:38:02,847
I have to go too.

365
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:05,359
You're not playing?

366
00:38:05,516 --> 00:38:07,894
I open the store at 3:00.
Janine's away.

367
00:38:08,753 --> 00:38:11,199
- Let's go swimming some time.
- We can try.

368
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,766
Hey, I know.

369
00:38:18,195 --> 00:38:20,835
Would you lend us the chalet
this weekend?

370
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:24,871
Why not?

371
00:38:25,336 --> 00:38:28,806
I don't know what we're doing.
I'll ask Jean-Marc.

372
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,210
Can you call me later?

373
00:38:48,392 --> 00:38:49,803
Hello there!

374
00:38:50,561 --> 00:38:51,835
You're home early.

375
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:53,474
For me?

376
00:38:54,532 --> 00:38:56,443
For you and our friends.

377
00:38:57,768 --> 00:38:59,645
For our friends and you.

378
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:04,285
What's the weather forecast?

379
00:39:04,442 --> 00:39:05,750
Blue skies. Why?

380
00:39:08,446 --> 00:39:10,892
The four of us are going
to the mountains.

381
00:39:11,282 --> 00:39:12,317
I'd love to.

382
00:39:12,583 --> 00:39:13,527
We're home!

383
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:19,660
They've gone shopping.

384
00:39:21,926 --> 00:39:24,634
Adam was going
to the town hall today.

385
00:39:34,939 --> 00:39:37,385
- What's for dinner?
- Duck in orange sauce.

386
00:39:42,313 --> 00:39:46,318
Adam and Eva won't be here
for dinner. They're seeing friends.

387
00:39:46,817 --> 00:39:47,955
They could have called.

388
00:39:48,285 --> 00:39:49,730
Last minute decision.

389
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:50,922
That's my point.

390
00:39:55,626 --> 00:39:58,038
In this weather,
they'll stay overnight.

391
00:39:59,029 --> 00:40:00,667
So much for the forecast!

392
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:05,240
It's a local low pressure front.

393
00:40:07,605 --> 00:40:09,209
I'm worried about mud.

394
00:40:15,813 --> 00:40:18,316
Maybe they're bored here with us.

395
00:40:18,482 --> 00:40:19,688
Want some cognac?

396
00:40:20,351 --> 00:40:23,161
We can't wait all night.
I'm going up.

397
00:40:59,156 --> 00:41:01,397
What's the forecast for tomorrow?

398
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:09,107
Where's the remote control?

399
00:41:18,409 --> 00:41:19,387
Hello.

400
00:41:23,581 --> 00:41:25,185
You've been shopping.

401
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:27,786
I feel all new.

402
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:31,666
This afternoon I had a dream.

403
00:41:31,956 --> 00:41:34,493
For the first time,
our house wasn't on fire.

404
00:41:35,726 --> 00:41:37,535
It was an underwater house.

405
00:41:39,296 --> 00:41:42,743
I swam through the living room
to get your painting.

406
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:45,676
The water was very clear,
very peaceful.

407
00:41:46,871 --> 00:41:50,876
We're sleeping better
now the Azores anticyclone has hit.

408
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:54,516
- You didn't predict the rain!
- True.

409
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:57,891
How was your evening?

410
00:41:58,382 --> 00:41:59,554
Very emotional.

411
00:41:59,717 --> 00:42:02,527
They're people
we haven't seen for years.

412
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:04,324
Since we first met.

413
00:42:04,755 --> 00:42:07,668
They're jazz musicians.
They were playing here.

414
00:42:07,825 --> 00:42:09,862
We dropped in on them.

415
00:42:10,394 --> 00:42:12,203
Did you find our note?

416
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:14,667
You didn't come home for us?

417
00:42:14,832 --> 00:42:15,810
No.

418
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:17,774
We have some good news.

419
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:21,979
The insurance company
will pay all reconstruction costs.

420
00:42:22,907 --> 00:42:24,318
That's excellent news.

421
00:42:24,475 --> 00:42:27,388
We'll even get money
for immediate costs.

422
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:29,782
We'll rent something locally.

423
00:42:29,947 --> 00:42:32,587
It's time for us to ease up on you.

424
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:34,855
You've been great the last 10 days.

425
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:39,698
Let's discuss it tomorrow.
It'll be blue skies all weekend.

426
00:42:40,824 --> 00:42:42,929
We're leaving you some time alone.

427
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:45,504
Our friends invited us
to the Montreux Festival.

428
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,676
It's more fun with jazz musicians

429
00:42:51,835 --> 00:42:54,406
than with us in a little chalet!

430
00:42:55,205 --> 00:42:56,616
- Madeleine...
- Oh, you!

431
00:43:03,681 --> 00:43:07,288
We wanted to surprise you
with a weekend away.

432
00:43:29,807 --> 00:43:30,877
I was coming up.

433
00:43:37,348 --> 00:43:39,760
Sorry, I don't know
what came over me.

434
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:44,528
I work too hard.

435
00:43:55,366 --> 00:43:58,313
Some fresh mountain air
will do us good.

436
00:43:59,503 --> 00:44:01,983
I'd love to hear
the glaciers crack.

437
00:44:03,374 --> 00:44:05,786
We can see
our friends play any time.

438
00:44:07,211 --> 00:44:09,191
Let's spend the weekend together.

439
00:44:32,736 --> 00:44:33,874
Coming up?

440
00:44:37,775 --> 00:44:38,776
Coming up?

441
00:44:40,811 --> 00:44:42,484
Yes, let's go up.

442
00:45:06,270 --> 00:45:07,476
What happens now?

443
00:45:07,638 --> 00:45:08,548
Nothing.

444
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:15,721
I can't...

445
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:18,788
I can't paint.

446
00:45:22,686 --> 00:45:23,687
Come here.

447
00:46:24,681 --> 00:46:25,659
Ready?

448
00:47:33,517 --> 00:47:34,757
We need some sleep.

449
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:37,964
Are you okay?

450
00:47:38,488 --> 00:47:39,466
Fine.

451
00:47:41,458 --> 00:47:42,596
It's fine.

452
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:44,032
A wild boar.

453
00:47:44,661 --> 00:47:47,005
- Did you hit it?
- I don't know.

454
00:47:48,265 --> 00:47:49,539
Maybe I killed it.

455
00:48:08,952 --> 00:48:10,590
Did you find the car?

456
00:48:11,488 --> 00:48:12,558
Good.

457
00:48:13,457 --> 00:48:18,065
No, the sooner the better.
We'll get the bodywork done later.

458
00:48:20,597 --> 00:48:22,577
About 6 o'clock? Thanks.

459
00:49:21,725 --> 00:49:23,329
Two coffees, please.

460
00:49:28,532 --> 00:49:29,772
Got any cigarettes?

461
00:49:53,156 --> 00:49:54,692
You smell.

462
00:49:57,928 --> 00:49:59,464
Does it bother you?

463
00:50:20,917 --> 00:50:22,055
Do you have a room?

464
00:50:22,219 --> 00:50:24,825
Yes. Room 11 or 17.

465
00:50:25,422 --> 00:50:27,129
The keys are on the board.

466
00:50:27,758 --> 00:50:29,396
It's 40 euros.

467
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:36,771
Thanks.

468
00:51:27,684 --> 00:51:28,890
What time is it?

469
00:51:29,686 --> 00:51:31,563
I don't know. Late.

470
00:51:34,624 --> 00:51:36,797
- I dozed off.
- Me too.

471
00:51:39,229 --> 00:51:40,503
It hurts.

472
00:52:05,322 --> 00:52:06,596
It's 5 o'clock.

473
00:52:13,697 --> 00:52:15,176
No message.

474
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:19,476
Maybe they were true friends.
We ruined it.

475
00:52:20,737 --> 00:52:23,980
I started it
and they didn't dare refuse.

476
00:52:26,009 --> 00:52:28,250
That's exactly
where they want you.

477
00:52:28,545 --> 00:52:32,357
They're cunning. You feel guilty
when it's their fault.

478
00:52:34,251 --> 00:52:35,992
We were completely...

479
00:52:37,487 --> 00:52:38,557
Fucked over.

480
00:52:43,393 --> 00:52:45,737
Adam's not blind, we were.

481
00:52:46,396 --> 00:52:47,773
We were manipulated.

482
00:52:49,332 --> 00:52:52,370
They're swingers,
they're very dangerous.

483
00:52:53,336 --> 00:52:55,179
We have to get rid of them.

484
00:52:57,674 --> 00:52:59,347
We're losing our grip.

485
00:53:04,381 --> 00:53:06,452
- Does it still hurt?
- Yes.

486
00:53:13,723 --> 00:53:15,396
Let's go home.

487
00:53:18,528 --> 00:53:19,666
You're right.

488
00:53:25,735 --> 00:53:28,272
They understood.
They've already gone.

489
00:53:28,438 --> 00:53:30,475
Or they're with the musicians.

490
00:53:57,801 --> 00:54:00,407
It's over, my love.
The room's empty.

491
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:02,174
Want a drink?

492
00:54:20,857 --> 00:54:22,131
I'm sorry.

493
00:54:22,292 --> 00:54:23,270
What for?

494
00:54:29,199 --> 00:54:30,177
I'll get it.

495
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:37,846
Yes, it's me.

496
00:54:39,142 --> 00:54:41,122
No, we didn't get away.

497
00:54:41,578 --> 00:54:43,489
We had an accident.

498
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:47,157
No, a roebuck.
Very early this morning.

499
00:54:48,518 --> 00:54:50,156
Okay, why not?

500
00:54:51,521 --> 00:54:53,262
Fine. Let's do that.

501
00:54:56,326 --> 00:54:57,498
It was Suzanne.

502
00:55:01,531 --> 00:55:03,238
I'll make dinner.

503
00:55:18,348 --> 00:55:21,625
Jean-Marc and Suzanne want
to go mushrooming tomorrow.

504
00:55:22,452 --> 00:55:23,726
Excellent idea.

505
00:55:44,507 --> 00:55:45,542
Coming up?

506
00:56:02,659 --> 00:56:04,366
Go up. I'll deal with it.

507
00:56:21,878 --> 00:56:22,879
It's open.

508
00:56:27,417 --> 00:56:28,521
Hello.

509
00:56:30,754 --> 00:56:31,664
The Italians.

510
00:56:32,856 --> 00:56:34,631
Dad, this is Joao.

511
00:56:40,897 --> 00:56:43,036
- Hello, Villiam.
- Wi-lliam.

512
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:44,902
Joao is Brazilian.

513
00:56:45,835 --> 00:56:48,338
- Mom's in bed?
- Yes... no.

514
00:56:49,939 --> 00:56:51,714
- Everything okay?
- Yes.

515
00:56:54,411 --> 00:56:56,687
You're locking Elise and Joao in.

516
00:56:56,846 --> 00:56:57,824
Sorry.

517
00:57:02,886 --> 00:57:05,867
Where will
the mayor and his wife live now?

518
00:57:06,022 --> 00:57:07,399
That's their problem.

519
00:57:07,557 --> 00:57:10,333
It's not easy
living on top of each other.

520
00:57:19,803 --> 00:57:21,043
Take your cell phone.

521
00:57:50,433 --> 00:57:51,343
Adam.

522
00:57:55,138 --> 00:57:56,378
How are you?

523
00:58:01,978 --> 00:58:02,956
What?

524
00:58:05,882 --> 00:58:06,860
What?

525
00:58:08,685 --> 00:58:09,959
The night in...

526
00:58:12,655 --> 00:58:14,157
Tomorrow night in Futuna?

527
00:58:20,163 --> 00:58:22,404
Where are they?
What did they say?

528
00:58:22,866 --> 00:58:24,709
Tomorrow night in Futuna.

529
00:58:25,702 --> 00:58:27,443
Is Futuna in the Pacific?

530
00:58:27,904 --> 00:58:29,042
Absolutely.

531
00:58:31,541 --> 00:58:32,576
I'm worried.

532
00:58:32,742 --> 00:58:34,813
Maybe they'll call back.
I'll go home.

533
00:58:34,978 --> 00:58:36,048
I'll come too.

534
00:58:36,646 --> 00:58:37,750
Don't wait for us.

535
00:58:37,914 --> 00:58:38,984
Something wrong?

536
00:58:41,017 --> 00:58:42,928
No, go without us.

537
00:58:46,456 --> 00:58:47,366
Hello.

538
00:58:49,392 --> 00:58:50,598
Nobody called?

539
00:58:55,031 --> 00:58:57,011
- Did you sleep well?
- Yes.

540
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:58,970
The room is lovely.

541
00:59:12,916 --> 00:59:15,123
It's cyclone season in the Pacific.

542
00:59:16,886 --> 00:59:18,024
What did you say?

543
00:59:19,055 --> 00:59:20,762
Maybe I heard him wrong.

544
00:59:39,375 --> 00:59:40,683
Do you mind the music?

545
00:59:41,177 --> 00:59:42,417
Not at all.

546
00:59:44,547 --> 00:59:46,356
- Want one?
- No.

547
00:59:47,684 --> 00:59:48,958
Still painting?

548
00:59:49,786 --> 00:59:52,130
I'm fed up with still lives.

549
01:00:00,697 --> 01:00:01,675
William?

550
01:00:01,831 --> 01:00:02,809
Yes, it's me.

551
01:00:02,966 --> 01:00:03,910
It's Adam.

552
01:00:06,202 --> 01:00:07,442
Where are you?

553
01:00:07,604 --> 01:00:10,414
We're in Paris.
We fly to Sydney tomorrow.

554
01:00:10,573 --> 01:00:14,020
The day after, we'll be
on the Pacific island, Futuna.

555
01:00:16,446 --> 01:00:17,754
William, can you hear me?

556
01:00:17,914 --> 01:00:22,488
I'm sorry about yesterday morning.
And we were mushrooming earlier.

557
01:00:22,652 --> 01:00:24,063
My phone didn't work.

558
01:00:24,387 --> 01:00:28,096
We're the ones who apologize.
Eva and I were distraught.

559
01:00:28,424 --> 01:00:30,028
We panicked when you left.

560
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:34,433
I decided to take up an offer
a friend made when he heard.

561
01:00:34,597 --> 01:00:36,167
We left immediately.

562
01:00:36,733 --> 01:00:39,714
I hope we didn't hurt your feelings.

563
01:00:40,036 --> 01:00:42,073
I'm truly sorry.

564
01:00:42,405 --> 01:00:45,750
Don't be. It's our fault. I mean...

565
01:00:46,609 --> 01:00:48,520
How long will you stay there?

566
01:00:49,445 --> 01:00:51,015
We're not coming back.

567
01:00:55,351 --> 01:00:57,888
You and Madeleine
were fantastic with us

568
01:00:58,054 --> 01:01:00,796
but we were shattered by the fire.

569
01:01:00,957 --> 01:01:03,528
We don't feel
up to living there again.

570
01:01:03,693 --> 01:01:06,765
We'll sell the house
as soon as it's rebuilt.

571
01:01:14,103 --> 01:01:15,582
It's not possible...

572
01:01:16,472 --> 01:01:17,450
What's wrong?

573
01:01:21,678 --> 01:01:23,680
My daughter's
getting married next month.

574
01:01:23,846 --> 01:01:25,848
We hoped you would...

575
01:01:26,015 --> 01:01:29,963
Of course, William.
We can come back for it.

576
01:01:30,119 --> 01:01:32,929
I'll resign from the council
just after.

577
01:01:33,790 --> 01:01:37,067
That's fantastic.
How do we do this?

578
01:01:37,393 --> 01:01:40,670
I'll back in a few days
and we'll fix a date.

579
01:01:40,930 --> 01:01:42,500
Okay, perfect.

580
01:01:45,768 --> 01:01:46,940
Is Eva okay?

581
01:01:47,970 --> 01:01:48,948
She's fine.

582
01:01:49,405 --> 01:01:51,578
She's by my side.
She sends her love.

583
01:01:53,476 --> 01:01:54,454
Me too.

584
01:01:57,380 --> 01:01:58,358
Well?

585
01:02:01,084 --> 01:02:02,392
They're distraught.

586
01:02:02,552 --> 01:02:03,690
Where are they?

587
01:02:04,887 --> 01:02:06,764
Heading for the Pacific.

588
01:02:06,923 --> 01:02:08,664
They're fine.

589
01:02:10,660 --> 01:02:12,662
You mean the mayor and his wife?

590
01:02:13,196 --> 01:02:15,733
Yes. The ones who lost everything.

591
01:02:16,899 --> 01:02:18,845
- They'll come back?
- Yes.

592
01:02:19,068 --> 01:02:20,206
When?

593
01:02:21,504 --> 01:02:23,450
In a month or two, if...

594
01:02:23,606 --> 01:02:25,017
Go ahead.

595
01:02:25,975 --> 01:02:27,147
Right now?

596
01:02:34,951 --> 01:02:37,022
Joao and I are getting married.

597
01:02:37,854 --> 01:02:42,599
We'd like to do it here,
in the village.

598
01:02:44,026 --> 01:02:45,903
- Are you pregnant?
- No.

599
01:02:46,829 --> 01:02:48,433
But it could happen.

600
01:02:53,970 --> 01:02:55,142
That's wonderful.

601
01:02:56,973 --> 01:02:59,613
- When's Adam coming?
- Whenever we want.

602
01:03:02,612 --> 01:03:04,148
Let's drink a toast.

603
01:03:07,617 --> 01:03:08,595
Done!

604
01:03:11,587 --> 01:03:14,591
What did they say exactly?
Why did they leave?

605
01:03:14,957 --> 01:03:16,698
We left, not them.

606
01:03:16,859 --> 01:03:20,671
I was wrong, Madeleine.
I'm sorry. They're so sensitive.

607
01:03:22,098 --> 01:03:24,601
This wedding is an excellent idea.

608
01:03:27,870 --> 01:03:29,144
If you say so.

609
01:03:33,276 --> 01:03:37,986
We always begin life
in an admirable twilight.

610
01:03:38,214 --> 01:03:41,821
Everything that later helps us
transcend disappointments

611
01:03:41,984 --> 01:03:45,454
depends on our first steps.

612
01:03:48,291 --> 01:03:51,761
Madeleine's field!
Sweet as the first day.

613
01:03:51,928 --> 01:03:54,636
To think yesterday
we walked on golden sands.

614
01:03:54,864 --> 01:03:58,175
It's a miracle
you were only an hour late.

615
01:03:58,334 --> 01:04:01,281
What time is it there...
in the Pacific?

616
01:04:01,604 --> 01:04:02,878
The sun's rising.

617
01:04:03,639 --> 01:04:05,516
We're about to wake up.

618
01:04:05,675 --> 01:04:07,211
Where's your luggage?

619
01:04:07,543 --> 01:04:08,886
At the hotel.

620
01:04:09,045 --> 01:04:10,046
The hotel?

621
01:04:10,213 --> 01:04:12,819
We thought that for a few days...

622
01:04:13,549 --> 01:04:15,927
Elise and Joao are sleeping upstairs

623
01:04:16,085 --> 01:04:18,793
but we set up a bed in the studio.

624
01:04:18,988 --> 01:04:21,264
Madeleine, that's very sweet,

625
01:04:21,858 --> 01:04:23,599
but stop worrying about us.

626
01:04:23,759 --> 01:04:25,329
You have enough to do.

627
01:04:41,110 --> 01:04:42,282
Have you seen them?

628
01:04:42,645 --> 01:04:43,988
Not for a while.

629
01:04:44,247 --> 01:04:46,124
They hardly spoke to us.

630
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:50,697
- We make them sick.
- No, it's jetlag.

631
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:45,878
I forgot where I was.

632
01:05:46,976 --> 01:05:49,684
Somewhere in heaven.

633
01:05:53,316 --> 01:05:55,887
We're going to a club,
the New Lagoon.

634
01:06:08,698 --> 01:06:10,678
How are our travelers?

635
01:06:11,901 --> 01:06:13,938
Sorry, we couldn't help it.

636
01:06:14,704 --> 01:06:18,208
Sorry we put you through this
in the state you're in.

637
01:06:18,841 --> 01:06:20,752
Now you must be starving.

638
01:06:20,910 --> 01:06:24,949
- Don't let us spoil it for you.
- We're off to the New Lagoon.

639
01:06:25,181 --> 01:06:26,251
Coming?

640
01:06:28,150 --> 01:06:29,652
Go ahead. We're coming.

641
01:06:30,453 --> 01:06:31,431
Let's go.

642
01:06:34,657 --> 01:06:36,534
I can tell you're hungry.

643
01:06:40,596 --> 01:06:43,099
Are the islands as pleasant as they say?

644
01:06:46,068 --> 01:06:46,978
Very.

645
01:06:55,945 --> 01:06:57,424
You're going back...

646
01:06:58,414 --> 01:06:59,916
At the end of next week.

647
01:07:06,889 --> 01:07:08,732
I'm scared it will rain.

648
01:07:20,469 --> 01:07:23,541
It's ridiculous.
Don't stay at the hotel.

649
01:07:23,873 --> 01:07:26,752
Stay here.
The studio's almost ready.

650
01:07:26,909 --> 01:07:28,547
You're exhausted.

651
01:07:29,879 --> 01:07:32,655
Do you really
want to go to a nightclub?

652
01:07:32,815 --> 01:07:34,123
You know me.

653
01:07:35,418 --> 01:07:36,522
In that case...

654
01:07:37,186 --> 01:07:39,826
the only problem
is our toothbrushes.

655
01:07:40,623 --> 01:07:42,193
I'll make the bed.

656
01:07:48,731 --> 01:07:49,732
I'll help you.

657
01:07:49,965 --> 01:07:51,501
Don't bother, Eva.

658
01:07:51,667 --> 01:07:53,613
It's done except for the sheets.

659
01:07:56,505 --> 01:07:58,007
I'll go get a...

660
01:08:38,047 --> 01:08:40,687
They talk about death

661
01:08:41,183 --> 01:08:42,924
Like you talk about fruit

662
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:46,623
They look at the sea

663
01:08:47,590 --> 01:08:51,003
Like you look at a well

664
01:08:56,232 --> 01:08:58,576
The women are lascivious

665
01:08:58,734 --> 01:09:01,510
In the fearsome sun

666
01:09:01,704 --> 01:09:04,275
Although it's not winter

667
01:09:04,974 --> 01:09:09,480
Nor is it summer

668
01:09:13,215 --> 01:09:16,025
Rain cuts across

669
01:09:16,185 --> 01:09:18,893
Pelting grain by grain

670
01:09:19,188 --> 01:09:22,032
A few old white horses

671
01:09:22,191 --> 01:09:26,765
Are humming Gauguin

672
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,674
For lack of a breeze

673
01:09:33,836 --> 01:09:37,682
Time stands still

674
01:09:38,707 --> 01:09:41,745
On the Marquesas

675
01:09:45,347 --> 01:09:48,226
From darkness, fires rise

676
01:09:48,551 --> 01:09:50,963
And dots of silence

677
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:53,760
They expand outwards

678
01:09:54,790 --> 01:09:56,770
This gives a softer light.

679
01:10:03,065 --> 01:10:05,773
The sea tears itself apart

680
01:10:05,935 --> 01:10:08,779
Infinitely shattered

681
01:10:08,938 --> 01:10:11,714
By rocks that take on

682
01:10:11,874 --> 01:10:16,254
Delirious names

683
01:10:20,649 --> 01:10:23,357
There in the distance, dogs

684
01:10:23,686 --> 01:10:26,166
Chants of repentance

685
01:10:26,322 --> 01:10:29,235
And a few dance moves

686
01:10:29,391 --> 01:10:33,305
And a few dance steps

687
01:10:39,702 --> 01:10:41,739
Can I make myself useful?

688
01:10:44,873 --> 01:10:45,943
Anyone home?

689
01:10:46,108 --> 01:10:47,246
You turned off...

690
01:10:47,409 --> 01:10:48,752
the light.

691
01:10:51,747 --> 01:10:53,124
Are you here, William?

692
01:10:53,682 --> 01:10:54,660
Yes.

693
01:10:55,985 --> 01:10:56,986
Welcome.

694
01:12:32,081 --> 01:12:33,321
We're over here.

695
01:13:07,282 --> 01:13:08,761
Has the sun risen?

696
01:13:09,017 --> 01:13:10,325
Yes.

697
01:13:12,855 --> 01:13:14,801
I wish I could see you.

698
01:13:39,882 --> 01:13:42,260
Why don't we move to your island?

699
01:13:45,087 --> 01:13:48,432
We could go for a month,
and come back to sell the houses.

700
01:13:48,590 --> 01:13:51,867
I'll sell the company
to my workers.

701
01:13:58,967 --> 01:13:59,945
You didn't come.

702
01:14:01,437 --> 01:14:03,280
No, we're sorry, darling.

703
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:05,510
No problem.

704
01:14:05,874 --> 01:14:07,319
See you later.

705
01:14:17,352 --> 01:14:20,333
Elise will visit more
if we're in the Pacific.

706
01:14:24,393 --> 01:14:26,999
"Couple Making Love
in a Lotus Flower"

707
01:14:30,566 --> 01:14:31,670
Gauguin.

708
01:14:31,934 --> 01:14:33,607
Painter of the islands.

709
01:15:13,175 --> 01:15:14,119
Ma'am?

710
01:15:19,381 --> 01:15:20,860
I drifted off!

711
01:15:21,183 --> 01:15:22,423
It's all done.

712
01:15:22,684 --> 01:15:23,662
Perfect.

713
01:15:24,119 --> 01:15:26,395
You can go, Bernard.
See you tomorrow.

714
01:15:26,555 --> 01:15:27,465
See you.

715
01:15:28,790 --> 01:15:30,133
Goodbye, Fabrice.

716
01:16:02,658 --> 01:16:07,129
I'll pass on your offer
to the owners tonight.

717
01:16:07,296 --> 01:16:09,173
We're in touch by e-mail.

718
01:16:09,331 --> 01:16:11,743
We'll call you early next week.

719
01:16:11,900 --> 01:16:12,844
Okay.

720
01:16:13,168 --> 01:16:15,580
- And the other house for sale?
- It's ours.

721
01:16:15,737 --> 01:16:17,341
- It's sold.
- Already?

722
01:16:17,506 --> 01:16:18,814
Already.

723
01:16:19,141 --> 01:16:20,245
Goodbye.

724
01:16:28,550 --> 01:16:31,531
Ghastly people
with their pools and ponies.

725
01:16:31,687 --> 01:16:32,825
What counts is to sell.

726
01:16:33,155 --> 01:16:35,795
Not just this house but ours too.

727
01:16:35,958 --> 01:16:37,869
If you won't let anyone visit...

728
01:16:38,193 --> 01:16:41,504
I know but they were
unbearable enough here.

729
01:16:41,763 --> 01:16:44,903
His face when you said,
"It's a waterfall in the rain."

730
01:16:47,402 --> 01:16:49,177
- Shall we go home?
- Let's go.

731
01:16:49,338 --> 01:16:50,749
By foot?

732
01:16:51,406 --> 01:16:53,909
- What about the cars?
- We'll get them tomorrow.

733
01:17:01,783 --> 01:17:03,262
That's for us.

734
01:17:03,719 --> 01:17:06,222
Another one?
I thought we were done.

735
01:17:18,367 --> 01:17:20,472
Hello, Mr. Lassere?

736
01:17:22,871 --> 01:17:24,873
Sorry to turn up unannounced.

737
01:17:25,207 --> 01:17:28,745
We saw your ad for the house
by chance.

738
01:17:28,910 --> 01:17:31,686
We don't live here
but we often pass by.

739
01:17:31,847 --> 01:17:33,190
We were at Lake Leman.

740
01:17:33,348 --> 01:17:35,851
We lost our phone
but we wanted to visit.

741
01:17:36,551 --> 01:17:37,461
Come in.

742
01:17:40,355 --> 01:17:41,527
They were at Lake Leman.

743
01:17:41,690 --> 01:17:43,192
Lucky you!

744
01:17:46,762 --> 01:17:49,265
We were having a drink.
Join us.

745
01:17:49,698 --> 01:17:51,006
Why not?

746
01:17:51,366 --> 01:17:52,344
Madeleine.

747
01:17:52,501 --> 01:17:53,479
Mathieu.

748
01:17:53,568 --> 01:17:54,546
Julie.

749
01:17:59,274 --> 01:18:03,416
The light was exactly like this
when I first saw the house.

750
01:18:05,814 --> 01:18:07,316
It's beautiful.

751
01:18:07,549 --> 01:18:10,928
Imagine your sculptures here
at this time of day.

752
01:18:11,620 --> 01:18:12,758
You're a sculptor?

753
01:18:13,488 --> 01:18:14,796
We're graphic designers.

754
01:18:15,057 --> 01:18:16,468
Freelance.

755
01:18:17,459 --> 01:18:19,837
I sculpt in my spare time.

756
01:18:21,963 --> 01:18:24,842
I'd love another...
"Tohu-bohu", is that it?

757
01:18:25,367 --> 01:18:26,368
That's it.

758
01:18:26,568 --> 01:18:27,706
Of course.

759
01:18:28,470 --> 01:18:29,949
It's what we drank there.

760
01:18:32,541 --> 01:18:33,679
You too, Mathieu?

761
01:18:34,309 --> 01:18:36,050
Yes, please. It's delicious.

762
01:18:44,820 --> 01:18:47,926
Why are you selling up?
It feels so right here.

763
01:18:48,523 --> 01:18:49,729
To go back.

764
01:18:50,425 --> 01:18:52,996
To the islands to join friends.

765
01:18:54,062 --> 01:18:58,511
It's tempting.
You're not scared you'll get bored?

766
01:18:58,934 --> 01:19:00,675
Is it as pleasant as they say?

767
01:19:01,369 --> 01:19:02,814
Yes, it is.

768
01:19:04,106 --> 01:19:08,054
What we'll miss the most
is the charm of the seasons.

769
01:19:10,045 --> 01:19:11,319
Starting over.

770
01:19:12,414 --> 01:19:13,518
Like tonight.

771
01:19:14,116 --> 01:19:15,789
Stay for dinner.

772
01:19:17,519 --> 01:19:21,433
You'll have time to visit the house
and drive home later.

773
01:19:22,090 --> 01:19:23,467
We'd love to.

774
01:19:25,827 --> 01:19:27,033
We'd love to.

775
01:19:28,530 --> 01:19:30,737
"They talk about death
like you talk about fruit

776
01:19:30,899 --> 01:19:33,846
They look at the sea
Like you look at a well

777
01:19:34,002 --> 01:19:36,676
The women are lascivious
In the fearsome sun

778
01:19:36,838 --> 01:19:39,409
Although it's not winter
Nor is it summer"

779
01:19:39,574 --> 01:19:42,919
"A few dance moves
And a few dance steps

780
01:19:43,612 --> 01:19:46,650
Night is submissive
And the wind fades"

781
01:19:46,815 --> 01:19:49,489
"Laughter is in the heart
The word is in a glance

782
01:19:49,918 --> 01:19:52,831
The heart is a traveler
The future left to chance"

783
01:19:52,988 --> 01:19:56,697
"Coconut trees pass by
Writing love songs"

784
01:20:04,566 --> 01:20:07,570
The truth is
we were bored stiff there.

785
01:20:17,012 --> 01:20:18,548
Tiramisu, anyone?

786
01:20:18,713 --> 01:20:20,454
It was delicious.

787
01:20:20,615 --> 01:20:22,026
I'll go get it.

788
01:20:23,485 --> 01:20:24,657
I'll help you.

789
01:21:03,491 --> 01:21:06,165
It's even magnificent inside.

790
01:21:06,595 --> 01:21:08,006
You can visit it all.

791
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:09,842
Thanks.

792
01:21:27,883 --> 01:21:29,453
I'm getting the cognac.

793
01:21:38,159 --> 01:21:39,661
I'm sorry.

794
01:21:42,163 --> 01:21:44,234
- We were cold.
- Come in.

795
01:21:47,969 --> 01:21:49,971
It cools down quickly.

796
01:21:52,641 --> 01:21:53,585
Cognac, Mathieu?

797
01:21:54,075 --> 01:21:55,679
Yes, please, Madeleine.

798
01:22:09,124 --> 01:22:10,831
Where is the bathroom?

799
01:22:10,992 --> 01:22:11,993
It's upstairs.

800
01:22:14,996 --> 01:22:15,906
I'll show you.

801
01:22:16,064 --> 01:22:17,304
After you.

802
01:22:39,788 --> 01:22:40,823
Here it is.

803
01:22:47,862 --> 01:22:50,138
Stay, if you want.

804
01:22:50,665 --> 01:22:51,803
I'd like that.

805
01:23:32,674 --> 01:23:33,675
Thank you.

806
01:23:37,512 --> 01:23:38,582
Let's go down.

807
01:24:49,984 --> 01:24:52,988
Thanks for your hospitality.

808
01:24:57,125 --> 01:24:59,162
You don't want to finish dinner?

809
01:24:59,494 --> 01:25:02,566
No thanks.
We have a long way to drive.

810
01:25:03,064 --> 01:25:06,671
I don't like driving at night,
especially on Saturday.

811
01:25:10,505 --> 01:25:11,984
Some other time?

812
01:25:13,007 --> 01:25:15,544
Sorry, we never see people again.

813
01:25:16,845 --> 01:25:17,983
I understand.

814
01:25:21,116 --> 01:25:22,288
Good luck, then.

815
01:25:22,617 --> 01:25:23,823
You too.

816
01:25:24,285 --> 01:25:25,662
Thanks again.

817
01:25:26,621 --> 01:25:28,259
- It was really nice.
- Thanks.

818
01:25:53,114 --> 01:25:55,185
Did you come to see the house?

819
01:25:55,350 --> 01:25:56,294
Yes.

820
01:25:56,885 --> 01:25:58,523
We like it here a lot.

821
01:25:58,820 --> 01:26:00,891
Things don't always go as planned.

822
01:26:04,893 --> 01:26:08,739
Do you often...
meet people like this?

823
01:26:10,798 --> 01:26:13,244
Sometimes, on a Saturday night.

824
01:26:13,968 --> 01:26:16,744
Hardly ever by chance,
like tonight.

825
01:26:18,039 --> 01:26:19,916
It was really nice.

826
01:26:21,943 --> 01:26:23,650
Drive carefully.

827
01:26:41,729 --> 01:26:43,640
I forgot to tell you.

828
01:26:45,300 --> 01:26:47,576
Michel and Annick
are getting married.

829
01:26:47,735 --> 01:26:48,713
When?

830
01:26:49,070 --> 01:26:50,777
This summer, I guess.

831
01:26:54,409 --> 01:26:56,218
It will be in the North.

832
01:26:56,778 --> 01:26:58,883
Annick is from Calais, I think.

833
01:27:07,155 --> 01:27:08,896
It's me. Hi, Jean-Marc.

834
01:27:09,991 --> 01:27:12,369
We were just talking about it.

835
01:27:16,864 --> 01:27:18,639
The Wedding's on August 15?

836
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:20,939
We didn't have definite dates.

837
01:27:22,770 --> 01:27:24,681
We'll still be here.

838
01:27:26,274 --> 01:27:28,379
What's another season?

839
01:27:29,310 --> 01:27:31,153
Anyway, they don't have seasons.

840
01:27:33,047 --> 01:27:37,518
I wonder if life is not made up of
rare moments of great importance

841
01:27:37,885 --> 01:27:41,628
and lots of interludes
that are only a shadow of them,

842
01:27:41,789 --> 01:27:43,564
hovering around us.

843
01:27:44,826 --> 01:27:46,828
Love, a beautiful melody...

844
01:27:48,496 --> 01:27:50,032
I haven't been drinking.

845
01:27:51,933 --> 01:27:55,278
Okay, see you Sunday.
Depending on the weather.

846
01:27:59,941 --> 01:28:01,750
I'm going up to the studio.

847
01:28:04,379 --> 01:28:06,882
Tomorrow, I'll send the offer
to Adam and Eva.

848
01:28:19,727 --> 01:28:21,536
I was thinking...

849
01:28:22,430 --> 01:28:23,773
You were thinking?

850
01:28:24,732 --> 01:28:25,972
Why sell after all?

851
01:28:27,168 --> 01:28:28,374
Absolutely.

852
01:28:30,505 --> 01:28:34,317
Let's stay. We can travel
wherever and whenever we want.

853
01:28:34,776 --> 01:28:35,948
Exactly.
