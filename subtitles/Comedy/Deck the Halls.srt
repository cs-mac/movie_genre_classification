1
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,279
Better here?

2
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,280
Or better here?

3
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,599
Better here?

4
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,600
Or better here? You don't want to be blind
at Christmas, Mrs Ryor. Help me out.

5
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,759
- l don't need glasses.
- You need binoculars.

6
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,239
We're settling for glasses.

7
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:07,240
- Better one?
- Glasses will make me look old.

8
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,480
Try these.

9
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,680
l look hot.

10
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,520
- Evening, Father Bruce.
- Hello, Dr Finch.

11
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:38,960
- Hello, Mrs Patterson.
- Hello, Dr Finch.

12
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,639
- Dr Finch.
- Hello, Gustave, Gerta.

13
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,640
l'd love to chat and so, but you know
how focused Gerta gets on our runs.

14
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,799
You should maybe get that looked at.

15
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,039
And start wearing some padding.

16
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,639
Well, l'm sure
it's more fun your way, Arturo,

17
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,640
but hang the decorations,
don'tjust chuck 'em up and hope they stick.

18
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,599
- Hey, Steve.
- Mayor Young.

19
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,599
- What do you think?
- Looking good.

20
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,159
- Thank you.
- ls that an angel on top?

21
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,799
lt should be,
but we couldn't find one big enough.

22
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,800
But my wife has a doll collection,
so she lent us her Marilyn Monroe.

23
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,560
Nice touch. lt looks good.
Don't go overboard with the lights, though.

24
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,640
- We don't want to seem tacky.
- As you say. Winterfest is your baby.

25
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,679
Have we got any big surprises this year?

26
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:35,680
Come on, nobody keeps a secret
better than me. For instance...

27
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:39,680
l know for a fact
that Sheriff Dave is a cross-dresser.

28
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,119
l never told a soul.

29
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,120
Until today.

30
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,360
Hi, honey. l'm home.

31
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,960
lt's the raw quail eggs, isn't it? lt's the texture,
right? The grainy, slimy, milky...

32
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,760
- Can you taste the curry?
- Yeah. Yeah.

33
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,679
Gee, l sure hope there's more ofthat.

34
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:45,399
You are such a bad liar.

35
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,119
l knew it was awful. lt's awful, right?

36
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,120
- Yeah.
- Who wants pizza?

37
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,119
My life just isn't working out
the way l thought it would.

38
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,919
- Excuse me?
- Oh, honey, you don't mean that.

39
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,359
l'm ten and what have l really accomplished?

40
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,360
A half-season of soccer.
Cleared legendary mode of Halo.

41
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,719
A lacklustre stint in the Cub Scouts.

42
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,919
Hey.

43
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,920
Hey, guess what day it is? Come on, guess.

44
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,440
- Maddy?
- l don't know and l don't care.

45
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,999
Wrong.

46
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
lt's December 1st.

47
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,160
Time to break out the Christmas calendar.

48
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,400
Yes, this is a busy time ofyear,
so you have to have a game plan.

49
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,920
OK. December 3rd, we hang the wreath.

50
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,560
- You get so intense about Christmas.
- l'm not intense, just extremely organised.

51
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:45,120
When talking about caroling,
you shouldn't say ''flanking manoeuvre''.

52
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:49,200
Look, l know it's only December 1st, but l
have all the planning to do for the Winterfest.

53
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,399
You have a cookbook to write,
the kids have school.

54
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,400
lt all goes by so quickly.
Before you know it, Christmas will be over.

55
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,839
That doesn't mean
we have to plan every second.

56
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,840
Look, my dad dragged me
from one air force base to another.

57
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,400
Christmas was not a priority for him.
We didn't even have a tree.

58
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,759
l want things to be different for my kids.

59
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:13,760
l want them to have
big family traditions year after year

60
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:17,120
that they can count on and look forward to.

61
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,719
You're right.

62
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,720
- l'm gonna try to be more supportive.
- Well, you should be.

63
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,520
Madison is a loner.
She has hardly any friends.

64
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,520
Carter's a ten-year-old boy
with a midlife crisis.

65
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:34,399
Let's face it, our kids are a little weird.

66
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,039
This year they need Christmas
more than ever.

67
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,319
You're right.

68
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:42,320
l'm sorry. You're right.

69
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:46,160
Snowmen, eggnog, caroling -
we're gonna do it all, OK?

70
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:50,560
OK.

71
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,920
- And l don't write cookbooks.
- What?

72
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,519
You always say that l write cookbooks,
but l don't.

73
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:07,520
l just edit other people's recipes and compile
them into cookbooks that nobody buys.

74
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,879
Then write your own.

75
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,880
So the rejection would be more personal?
No, thank you.

76
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,959
- l think you should.
- Really?

77
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,159
- Yeah. l think you could.
- Really?

78
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,160
Sure.

79
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,759
What is that?

80
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,760
- ls it a truck?
- l don't know.

81
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,079
Looks like we have new neighbours.

82
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,080
Who moves in the middle ofthe night?
A meth lab?

83
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,360
How bad could it be?

84
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,560
Here we go. OK.

85
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,839
Hot!

86
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,279
Whoa, big guy. Take it easy.

87
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,280
You're spazzing out on me.
Look like you're having a seizure.

88
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:29,639
l got Tasered once.
lt looked exactly like that.

89
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:32,640
- And l'm man enough to say l wet myself.
- Who are you?

90
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,600
l'm Buddy Hall.
We just moved in across the street.

91
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,199
- You don't happen to have a cat, do you?
- No.

92
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,200
Good. l was moving in last night,
l accidentally dropped a fridge on one.

93
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,199
- Thank God most of it got away.
- Buddy!

94
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:49,079
Tia, come on over and meet...
What's your name?

95
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:52,080
- Steve Finch. But this isn't a good time.
- Come and meet Steve.

96
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,079
- Good morning.
- Oh, well.

97
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,519
Steve, you have a way with the ladies.

98
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,439
Oh, thank you.

99
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:03,119
Kelly, this is Buddy, our next-door neighbour.

100
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,120
Honey, l measured and
the ceiling's too low in the bedroom.

101
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,039
We're gonna have to get a shorter pole.

102
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:12,040
Morning. Oh, what did he do?
Try to steal your paper?

103
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,960
- No, l was just being neighbourly.
- Leave you alone for five minutes...

104
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:20,720
Looks like we got a visitor.

105
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:25,120
Don't put the little guy away on my account.

106
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,599
Tia, this is Kelly. Kelly, this is Tia.

107
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,919
- Hi, so nice to meet you.
- You too.

108
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,559
- You have kids, right?
- We do.

109
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:36,560
Why don't you come over?
We should talk about starting a car pool.

110
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:40,240
- That sounds great. Welcome. Bye.
- Thank you.

111
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,560
Watch out, it's hot. Hot, hot, hot.

112
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,599
Mm, it's good.

113
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,600
- l can't believe this.
- We're just saying hello.

114
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,879
Come on in, it's open.

115
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:58,199
- Hello.
- Oh, good.

116
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,159
Could you come over here
and give me a little boost?

117
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,359
Oh, sure.

118
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,839
Seriously, l'm about to break my neck.

119
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:07,840
Just yank it up there.
Yeah, just a little bit harder.

120
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,559
More. Up.

121
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,560
There you go.
That's one way to get acquainted, huh?

122
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:17,520
- Oh, these are for you.
- Oh, thank you.

123
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,199
l love blueberry.

124
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,200
Right to the hip.

125
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,720
- And who do we have here?
- This is Madison. Say hello, Madison.

126
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,959
Hello, Madison.

127
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,960
- She's 15. You know how they get.
- You're kidding me? 15? My girls are 15.

128
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:38,400
Girls! Get your butts down here!
We've got company.

129
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,799
Carter. Carter!

130
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,800
- You're staring.
- Oh. Oh. Sorry about that.

131
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,960
l used to do some modelling, mostly
for art classes at the community college.

132
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:52,160
- That's how l met Buddy.
- Really? Was he an artist?

133
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:56,080
No, they caught him peeking
in through the windows.

134
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,840
- That's such a sweet story.
- l just got so tired of dating boys.

135
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,119
No offence.

136
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,120
Then one day l met Buddy and
he just swept me right off my feet.

137
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,119
Oh, there you are.

138
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:13,120
These are my babies, Ashley and Emily.

139
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,199
- Hi, girls.
- Hi.

140
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,839
- This is Madison and this is Carter.
- Hi.

141
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:21,840
You girls will probably
be in a lot ofthe same classes.

142
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,240
Great. Are there any hot guys?

143
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:28,480
Yeah, but, you know,
they're all enormous tools.

144
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,759
Really? Will you introduce us?

145
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:33,599
Kelly, thank you.
That has been in my family for years.

146
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,639
- lt's beautiful.
- lt ought to be.

147
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:38,640
lt's worth more than
this entire house put together.

148
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:41,279
l'll find a safe place and we'll get to school.

149
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:44,039
l can drop them all at school
ifyou want to unpack.

150
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,639
- Really?
- Sure.

151
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,759
- You'd do that for me?
- No problem.

152
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,119
l'll get the car while they get dressed.

153
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:53,120
They are dressed. This is more clothes
than they've worn in months.

154
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:57,040
- Can l live here?
- Get in the car.

155
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,480
- You got a fake lD?
- No.

156
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,159
- Don't worry. We can make you one.
- Nice girls.

157
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,160
You kidding me? l pray every day for the
strength not to run over them with the truck.

158
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,159
Have a nice day.

159
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,160
All right, listen up, you guys.
We just got in a new shipment ofAspens.

160
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:17,280
And l want you to sell three for me
by lunchtime. All right.

161
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:20,479
- What? Are you kidding?
- Hey! We got a new salesman.

162
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,199
Buddy Hall over here.
Let's make him feel welcome.

163
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,200
All right, all right, all right.

164
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:30,080
Welcome aboard. Sell, sell, sell. All right.

165
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,199
This is gonna be good.

166
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:39,200
Buddy, hey.
So, are you ready to sell some cars?

167
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,039
Me? l'm a born car salesman.

168
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:45,040
But l was thinking today that maybe l would
just kinda ease into it, get a feel for the place.

169
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:50,720
Yeah, well, you see that tyre-kicker
right there? He's all yours.

170
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,680
- l don't know.
- l got 1,000 bucks says you can't sell him.

171
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,120
- Let me in on that action.
- Let's just make it three.

172
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:03,760
- Three?
- Three Gs.

173
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,200
All right. You guys are asking for it.

174
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:12,160
There's one born every minute. Come on.

175
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,839
Ted, this is genius.

176
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:17,840
You can't let these new guys
get into a rhythm.

177
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,920
l'm telling you, boys,
from this day forward, we own that guy.

178
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,999
Here we go.

179
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
The brush-off, the brush-off.
OK, here he comes.

180
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,119
- We got you.
- Are you OK?

181
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,120
You walked facefirst into that, Buzzo.

182
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:41,360
Money on my desk by the end ofthe day.
No cheques.

183
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,320
- That's not possible.
- Mr Murray owns the dealership.

184
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:56,160
l just bought one of my own cars.

185
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,320
And the worst part is
l paid sticker.

186
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:10,280
- Hey, girls.
- Hey, Dad.

187
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,639
And?

188
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:25,640
- Sold a car the first five minutes.
- Buddy, no? Oh, my God!

189
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:29,839
Things are gonna work out
great this time, baby.

190
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:32,840
- l'm so proud ofyou.
- Great, great, great, great. Yeah.

191
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:37,119
- lt's great.
- Buddy?

192
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,479
Buddy?

193
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,519
- Buddy? Bud?
- Yeah.

194
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,599
- l know.
- Don't you even.

195
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,600
You always do this.
You start out great, you lose interest.

196
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:49,200
And the next thing you know,
l'm up to my neck in cardboard boxes.

197
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,239
No, it's great. l'm a car salesman.

198
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,319
Hey, that's a good job.

199
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,320
lt's a greatjob. Greatjob.
Car salesman, carpets, copiers.

200
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,840
Futons.

201
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:06,359
lt's all the same.

202
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:09,360
l don't know, l was just hoping
that one day l'd do something big.

203
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:14,119
Something important.

204
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,279
Something monumental.

205
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:19,280
You are. You're going to pay off
our monumental debt.

206
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:23,840
Buddy, you promised me.

207
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Well, l will keep my promise.

208
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,120
Everything's going to be great.

209
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,760
Daddy, Daddy, come look.
We got something real cool.

210
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,279
The honeys.

211
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:40,280
Hey, Dad.

212
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:45,080
- What do you got going here?
- lt's MyEarth. You type in an address

213
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,319
and you can see every house
in the country from space.

214
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,799
Really?

215
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,800
Emily's used it to track
the five hottest guys in school.

216
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,119
Yeah. Three ofthem live two blocks away.

217
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:59,120
Wow. That's more math
than you've done in years. Did it hurt?

218
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,039
Loser.

219
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,239
Easy. You can see every house from space?

220
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:06,240
- Yeah.
- Let's see.

221
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:15,080
- Where's our house?
- Oh, you can't see our house.

222
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,279
But you can see the neighbour's.

223
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:20,280
- That figures. We're invisible.
- Buddy. Trash.

224
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:27,360
Space, huh?

225
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:38,320
Of course, you can see the big house.

226
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:04,840
See it from space?

227
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:09,360
l'll light it up.

228
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,040
Not gonna be invisible any more.

229
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,400
Three o'clock in the morning. Unbelievable.

230
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:39,520
Oh, man.

231
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,839
Buddy.

232
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,039
- Buddy.
- Hey, Steve.

233
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,079
Do you have any idea what time it is?

234
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,319
Are all the clocks in your house busted?

235
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,839
No. l know what time it is.

236
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:53,840
Oh, did you just need an excuse
to come over here in your underwear?

237
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,680
No, l was being sarcastic.

238
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:01,360
You gotta know that stuff like that
just goes right over my head.

239
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:04,839
- Hold these things. l'll strand them out.
- l will not.

240
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:07,840
That's why l came over here.
You're making all kinds of noise.

241
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,879
Do you have any idea
how bright your house is?

242
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,759
Yeah, it's pretty damn bright.

243
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,759
Look at that.

244
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:19,760
Oh, is that what's bothering you? The lights?

245
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:23,280
- Yes, that's right.
- l'm sorry. l didn't mean it. l'll turn them off.

246
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:26,159
Thank you. Thank you.

247
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,799
Steve.

248
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,800
Are we gonna be friends? Because
we just moved into the neighbourhood

249
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,600
and, boy, it would be bad
if l ticked offthe only guy l know.

250
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:41,080
- That would kill me.
- Well, maybe l overreacted a little bit.

251
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,880
Well, you know,
l can be a real jerk sometimes.

252
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,080
Maybe we should just start completely over.

253
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,719
Buddy Hall. And you are?

254
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:56,720
No, l didn't mean we should literally...
l was speaking metaphorically.

255
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:03,760
That's it. l don't...
Sometimes, my stupidity astounds me.

256
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:10,160
l got an idea. How about ifyou and l
come up with a series of hand signals

257
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,080
so l'll know when you're gonna talk weird?

258
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:19,840
l'll see you tomorrow.

259
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:24,880
This is gonna be good. Get that
satellite image up that you had before.

260
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,239
Go on. Here, honey, you sit here.

261
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,399
Yeah, sit right there and watch.

262
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,239
- There's so many buttons.
- l'll do it. Move.

263
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:36,240
OK, you do it. Where are you going?
Stick around. l want you to see this.

264
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,759
- You still can't see it.
- You're gonna miss it.

265
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,760
What? You can't see it? lt's impossible.
l put so many more lights on.

266
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:46,960
Honey, you're gonna get it. You'll get it.

267
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,720
l gotta go bigger.

268
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:04,879
- Oh, hi.
- Can you order me more ofthese?

269
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,439
- Sure.
- Yeah?

270
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:09,440
- Yeah.
- What's that?

271
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,440
You're gonna love this.

272
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:18,399
lt's a horse-drawn sleigh.

273
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,400
- You don't see many ofthese around.
- No, you don't.

274
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,600
Nice.

275
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,879
l'll take it.

276
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,359
- No!
- Come on. Why?

277
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,360
Get away from me with that.
l'll call Child Services.

278
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,079
One look at that and they will put you away.

279
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,639
Maddy. Maddy.

280
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,640
We always wear matching sweaters
for the family Christmas card. lt's all right.

281
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:44,239
Please?

282
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,240
Look, huh?

283
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,679
Please.

284
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:52,679
- Are we ready?
- You see, Mom's wearing hers.

285
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:55,680
OK, Mom's old and married.
She doesn't need the self-esteem.

286
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:59,159
- l still have something to live for.
- lt's true.

287
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:02,160
Madison's right.
She's got her whole life ahead of her.

288
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,599
lt's more than l can say for some of us.

289
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,600
He does this every year.
He starts acting all depressed

290
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,199
so people feel bad
and buy him bigger presents.

291
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,200
- Hey! The new neighbours have reindeer.
- Reindeer?

292
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:17,680
Wait. Wait. Wait.

293
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:20,719
Hey, Steve, what do you think?

294
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,399
Oh, my God.

295
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,400
lt's so cute.
Where in the world did you find it?

296
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,440
Eugene Young down at the hardware store
sold it to him. lsn't it beautiful?

297
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:32,680
Beautiful.
Yes, and these horses... these horses...

298
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:36,560
l especially like the way you've
duct-taped the antlers to their heads.

299
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:40,480
Yeah, well, apparently reindeer
are not indigenous to the region.

300
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,440
- That sweater is really cool.
- Yeah, is it Marc Jacobs?

301
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:49,120
l'm not sure. l have so many,
it's kind of hard to keep track these days.

302
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:54,560
Well, this has been fun.
So let's go take the picture, huh?

303
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,759
Wait, what picture? Your Christmas picture?

304
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,839
You should take it here in the sleigh.

305
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,840
- That's a great idea.
- No, that's a horrible idea,

306
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,360
because we take our picture
in front ofthe fireplace. lt's a tradition.

307
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:10,360
- Wouldn't it be nice to try something new?
- No, l don't think so.

308
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,720
Here's a hat. Take the picture in the sleigh.
You put the Santa suit on.

309
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:17,600
- You'll take the picture in the sleigh.
- That's silly.

310
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:20,680
- lt's adorable.
- Carter, get out ofthere. Right now.

311
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,639
We should keep our voices down,

312
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:26,640
because l found these horses
on the outskirts oftown

313
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:29,599
and, between you and me,
they look a little skittish.

314
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,600
You found these horses?
Carter, out ofthat deathtrap now!

315
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:37,280
- OK, Carter, give me your hand.
- Carter, let's go. Give me the reins.

316
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:41,080
Let go. Let go ofthe reins. Let go ofthe reins!

317
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,759
- Oh, my God. Steve!
- Honey! Honey!

318
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:53,760
- Daddy!
- Honey!

319
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,319
- Run, run, run, run!
- Daddy!

320
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:59,320
Whoa, stop, horsey!

321
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:07,920
That's not good!

322
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,520
How do you steer this thing?

323
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,200
Out ofthe way! Out ofthe way!

324
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:25,760
Mrs Ryor!

325
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:44,880
Oh, my!

326
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,439
Santa! He's real!

327
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:53,440
l knew it! l knew it!

328
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:13,040
Oh, boy!

329
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:33,840
He's coming to.
l think he's gonna be all right.

330
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
- Where am l?
- We're in the back seat ofyour wife's car,

331
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:42,720
on the way to the hospital.
You warming up?

332
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:45,920
Yeah.

333
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,999
Where are my clothes?

334
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
You were freezing to death.
We had to get you out ofthem.

335
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:56,920
- Where are your clothes?
- l had to get your body temperature up,

336
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:00,560
so l stripped us both down
and zipped us into this sleeping bag.

337
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:05,320
Trust me, it works.
l've done it a half a dozen times.

338
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,520
Calm down, calm down.

339
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,239
The doctor said he saved your life.

340
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:22,240
Which is only fair, since he's the one
who almost got me killed in the first place.

341
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:27,040
This used to be such a nice,
quiet neighbourhood. Look at it now.

342
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:30,640
People driving by all night.

343
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:37,200
Did you see that? Did you see that?
l think he's tapping into our power.

344
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:41,320
Yes. And in the process,
he is stealing our very souls.

345
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:44,800
- How do you think he's powering his lights?
- l think you're wrong about him.

346
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,080
Look at what he dropped off. He knew
we didn't get a chance to take a picture,

347
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:53,440
so look what he made
from a picture he took at the hospital.

348
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,599
- That's you, with the blue lips.
- Yeah.

349
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:59,599
Yeah, and a cute little oxygen tube
coming from your nose.

350
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,999
Yeah, l picked up on that. Thanks.

351
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Come on, now.
That is a nice gesture, don't you think?

352
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,359
OK.

353
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,360
OK, yeah. Maybe. l don't know.
Maybe. l don't know.

354
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,759
l think we should take them
with us to get the tree.

355
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,599
- No!
- Yes.

356
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,600
Cos l really like Tia.
She's taking a real interest in my cookbooks,

357
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,520
and you just need to find a way
to get along with Buddy.

358
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,999
OK, but he's not touching any of my trees.

359
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,199
OK, fine. But they're coming with us.

360
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,519
- Hey, Mom.
- Hey, sweetie.

361
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,239
Hey, Dad.

362
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:34,240
l was thinking, maybe you could take me
Christmas shopping for Mom.

363
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:37,439
We could go to the mall and wander around.

364
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,440
- We could get hot chocolate.
- Know what? Already taken care of.

365
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,880
You're getting her a nice sweater
that l ordered from a catalogue.

366
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:47,599
So we don't have to go to the mall together.

367
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,600
lsn't that great?
lt's an insane asylum this time ofyear.

368
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:00,920
A little more power.

369
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,639
- Did you see that?
- Yeah.

370
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,640
You did?

371
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,840
Come on, kids. Carter, come on.

372
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,279
Oh, you guys have your own lot.

373
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:43,280
- Private.
- lt's great. Steve's worked on it for years.

374
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:46,560
So nice. Oh, this is amazing, honey. Look.

375
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,599
lt's a nice tree, honey.

376
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:55,600
Nice? lt's perfect. A 12-foot silver noble.

377
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,639
Yes, sir, this is the way
God intended trees to look.

378
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:02,640
What do you do?
Chop 'em down or launch 'em?

379
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:06,800
Laugh all you want. But l got
the next five years oftrees lined up.

380
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:10,400
And each one ofthem is perfect.
No twisted trunks, no bald spots.

381
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:15,040
Well, it's certainly a dandy tree,
l'll give you that.

382
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,519
Honeys, let's go.

383
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:20,520
- Yeah, Dad, let's find a really big one.
- But it has to be pretty.

384
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,919
Hey.

385
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:25,920
The last ones to the car are losers.

386
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,879
Please. lt's not like it's a race.

387
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,880
- Give me the axe. No way he beats us.
- Honey, you said he could cut it down.

388
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:37,800
Well, he can do it next year.
Come on, give me the axe.

389
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:41,560
- lt's all right, sweetheart.
- What's the record?

390
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,960
Well, Dad, l think l wrote it down in my diary,
but l must have forgot.

391
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:49,120
Funny. But we'll be halfway home
by the time he...

392
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,119
Does anyone smell gas?

393
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:02,120
Well, it's probably me, but cut me some slack,
l'm swinging pretty hard.

394
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:11,280
Oh, my God!

395
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:15,440
- Sweetheart, do something.
- What? What happened?

396
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,959
- We're ruining the forest.
- What's happening?

397
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,960
- No, it's got the fence too.
- The trees.

398
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:25,080
The little one. The little one.

399
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:37,160
15 years. 15 years
l've been growing those trees.

400
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,840
He obviously didn't mean to do it, honey.
lt was an accident.

401
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:44,119
He did offer to cut you down a tree, Dad.

402
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:47,120
Finches always have a silver noble tree. lt's
a tradition, and thank God they had one left.

403
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,600
You get the tree, son.

404
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:56,800
All right, here we go.
Keep it up. That's a girl.

405
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,600
l'm pretty sure you broke the record
cutting this one down, Dad.

406
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,439
Better there?

407
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:13,239
Better there?

408
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:16,240
Better one? Better two?

409
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,919
- l can't believe you made it.
- Hi, guys.

410
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,559
- Hi, guys.
- Merry Christmas.

411
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:23,560
Hi, thanks for coming. Merry Christmas.

412
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:27,800
Honey, the girls are having so much fun
showing everybody the lights.

413
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:32,559
l pray that's all they're showing 'em.
You coming?

414
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,799
- l'll run a sequencer on the lights.
- Buddy!

415
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,199
- Synchronise it to the music.
- Are you deaf?

416
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,200
These people are depending on me
to give 'em something amazing.

417
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,919
And that's just what l'm gonna do.

418
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:45,599
ls it me? Oh, God.

419
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,519
A good idea to have
a fire extinguisher around.

420
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:51,520
You think?

421
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:57,599
Oh, no.

422
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,600
More lights? No.

423
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:06,719
Buddy. Buddy.

424
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,119
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Hi, Steve.

425
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:12,079
- More lights?
- ls that your shop across the street?

426
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:15,080
- This is wrong. All this has to go back.
- What do you think ofthe tree for Winterfest?

427
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:19,759
- Well...
- Steve, l was talking to Buddy here.

428
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:22,760
l mean, after all, he is the expert.

429
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:26,160
- Come on, would you have a look?
- Watch my stuff, Steve.

430
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:30,480
Hi, folks. Everything's free today.
Anything you want.

431
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:33,600
l love the coloured strands of lights.
The spacing is great.

432
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:36,559
- Thank you.
- Ornaments, well dispersed.

433
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,399
Oh, yes.

434
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:41,400
l see you're using my bulb of choice, the C9.

435
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:46,080
Very nice.
That adds a lot of class to that tree. l love it.

436
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,919
- Thank you.
- Really good.

437
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:51,920
- He likes it.
- Hey, Steve, that... that is a tree.

438
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Yes, it is. Yeah. Listen, we need
to get something straight.

439
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:00,359
Around here, l'm the Christmas guy.

440
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:03,360
- Really?
- Yeah, it's kind of my thing.

441
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:07,320
Chris has Memorial Day. Pete has
the Fourth ofJuly, but l have Christmas.

442
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:11,479
But, hey, you can have Halloween.

443
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:14,159
- Oh, good. Halloween?
- Yeah, sure.

444
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,679
Pumpkins in the yard, a skeleton or two.

445
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:19,439
You can jump out and scare people.
What do you think?

446
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:22,440
l don't think so. This Winterfest thing,
what is this all about?

447
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:26,159
lt's our annual Christmas carnival.

448
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:29,160
We have a show, games, ice sculpture, races.

449
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:33,040
l happen to be the chairman.
lt's a pretty prestigious position.

450
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:36,480
- Races? What kind of races?
- Speed skating.

451
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,879
We do it here.
They put the ice down here on Main Street.

452
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:42,319
l used to do a little speed skating myself.

453
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,679
Really? Well, so did l.

454
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:47,680
- Excuse me. Wallace Fiskin.
- Buddy Hall.

455
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:52,240
Sir, meeting you is one of
the great moments of my life.

456
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,999
Thank you. lt's a pleasure to meet you.

457
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,000
So, anyway... How do you feel
about the liberal use of mistletoe?

458
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:02,760
Well, l feel that you should go sparingly
around the threshold,

459
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,519
because that's a cliché.

460
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:09,239
Please. Please.

461
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:11,439
- My mission is clear.
- Thank you.

462
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:14,119
Good luck.
Would you take this inside for me?

463
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:17,120
Steve. Oh, Steve.

464
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:20,360
l guess l'm the new Christmas guy.

465
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:23,680
That's OK. You can take Toe Jam Day.

466
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,760
This isn't over yet. We're just getting started.

467
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:31,920
l'm the Christmas guy.
l'm the Christmas guy!

468
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:38,240
Honey, Tiajust gave me a great idea.

469
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:42,399
- l'm gonna write my own cookbook.
- That's my girl.

470
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:45,400
Tia gave you the idea?
l've been telling you to do that for years.

471
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:48,720
You know what? lt should be cookbook
for real moms who cook for real families.

472
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:54,600
Yes. And l have the title for you.

473
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:57,159

475
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,960
Dad, there's 50 singing dorks
waiting in the front yard.

476
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:05,079
50? lsn't that great?

477
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:08,080
You know what?
You are gonna help me write the cookbook.

478
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,919
- OK. l'd be happy to.
- Yes!

479
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:16,879
Kids.

480
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,799
Oh, nice.

481
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:21,800
- Where are your clothes?
- Calm down, Dad. l have ajacket.

482
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:24,479
Well, keep it zipped.

483
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,480
- Where are the twins?
- They'll be over when the boys come.

484
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:30,359
Boys? Boys? Madison is not allowed to date.

485
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:33,360
Honey, don't worry, it's a one-time thing.
They ship out next week.

486
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,799
- They're in the navy?
- Bye, Dad.

487
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:39,239
Wait! Wait!

488
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:42,240
Wait! Wait!

489
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,600
Thank you for coming,
and thank you for braving the insanity.

490
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:52,240
l have the songbooks here,
so pass them amongst yourselves.

491
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:58,400
Do you have
''There's An Acorn ln My Stocking''?

492
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:03,519
Do you have ''The lgnorant Snowman''?

493
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:06,520
- l don't think l do.
- There's a news crew over at the Halls'.

494
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:10,240
Yeah, it really is quite a spectacle.

495
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:13,280
l thought that we would start
with one of my very favourites.

496
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:16,720
''The Holly and the lvy''.
Pitch pipe.

497
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:19,279
Oh, l'm sorry. Hi.

498
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:22,280
- Have a good time. Sing away.
- Sorry, honey.

499
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:26,920
Thanks for coming.

500
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:34,560
- l love that song!
- No, wait. Wait, come back.

501
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:38,119
Come back here.
We're not done with rehearsal.

502
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:41,120
Come back. We're going caroling.
lt's a tradition. Everybody...

503
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:44,719
Honey. You!

504
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:47,720
l'm not going anywhere.

505
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:50,920
Where are the kids?

506
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:54,680
Oh, look. They're going
to be making kissing and so.

507
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:57,079
Kissing and so.

508
00:34:57,080 --> 00:35:00,080
Hello, there. We're from Channel Eight News,
and we would love to have an interview.

509
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:05,120
Hi. l'm just very happy
that everyone likes the lights.

510
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:11,080
Yes, indeed. Obviously you have
put an awful lot ofwork into this.

511
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:14,719
Yeah. And l'm nowhere near being finished.

512
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:17,720
Oh, are you kidding me? Jesus!

513
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:25,520
Look at that. The lights have brought
out the Christmas spirit in everyone.

514
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:30,520
Yeah. They bring out
the Christmas spirit in everybody.

515
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:34,399
- Yeah, l'm really happy about that.
- Oh, my gosh.

516
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:37,159
l'm not gonna stop until l have

517
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:40,160
the biggest and brightest light display
in the world.

518
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:45,440
- Oh, please.
- l also...

519
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:48,960
l really want my house to be seen...

520
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:54,039
from space!

521
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:56,159
Oh, my God!

522
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,719
- Outer space.
- Oh, God!

523
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,919
Honey, wait. What are you gonna do?

524
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:03,920
You heard him, didn't you?
This is gonna stop. Tonight.

525
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,999
We'll see what Sheriff Dave has to say.

526
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Does anybody know
who these RVs belong to? Anybody?

527
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:13,120
- Why? You want to make me an offer?
- No, l need to get out.

528
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:17,240
OK. Scoot on through.

529
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:21,400
- l don't know.
- l swear to God, men can't drive any more.

530
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,839
Hold my beer, l'll do it for you.

531
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:26,840
OK, OK, l'll do it, l'll do it. Just guide me out.

532
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,400
All right.

533
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:35,160
You could probably use a few more lights
on your house. Look at that thing.

534
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,479
- All right, you ready?
- You sure?

535
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:42,480
That's why l'm here, buddy. Don't worry.
l'm watching you. l'm watching.

536
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,999
A little bit to your right.
No, no, your other right.

537
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,000
- Yeah, come on.
- l can't see the other side at all.

538
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:53,200
No, that's OK.
l'm your eyes. l'm your eyes.

539
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:58,160
- Straight back.
- Doesn't look like enough room to me.

540
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:07,200
- God!
- Oh, boy!

541
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,919
Oh, that's ugly.

542
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:18,920
OK, OK. lt's all right. At this point,
it's like pulling off a Band-Aid.

543
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,759
You gottajust gun it. You know what l mean?

544
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,999
OK, you ready?

545
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,399
One, two...

546
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:30,400
Gun it!

547
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:45,359
Get out ofthe way, please. Excuse me.

548
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:48,360
This is an active roadway.
Please. Oh, come on.

549
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:12,399
Sheriff, do something
about my neighbour's house.

550
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:15,400
Oh, yeah, the Hall place. l take my kids
by there every night after dinner.

551
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:18,599
lt keeps getting bigger and bigger.

552
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:21,600
Yes. Well, that's why l want you to arrest him.

553
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:24,079
Arrest him? On what charge?

554
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:26,479
- Light trespass.
- Light trespass?

555
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,799
Uh-huh.

556
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:30,239
Yes. Light trespass.

557
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:33,240
''When bright, uncontrolled light
shines in neighbouring property or windows

558
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:36,999
as to cause a public nuisance.''

559
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Well, l'm public and l've been nuisanced.

560
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:44,280
Well, l can't arrest a man for dec...
What are you looking at?

561
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:48,440
- What? This?
- No. l...

562
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:51,600
l don't mind ifyou wear a bra.
Looks like a nice one.

563
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:55,440
lt's a brace. My wife made it for me.

564
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:58,640
l dislocated my shoulder and it keeps
popping back out. What did you think?

565
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:04,720
- Did you think l was wearing a bra?
- No. That would...

566
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,399
That would be crazy.

567
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:10,400
Now, as far as the lights are concerned,

568
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:13,520
l'm saying it's Christmas and
you have a lot on your mind with Winterfest,

569
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:17,520
but ifyou want to file a complaint,
l'll fill out the paperwork.

570
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:20,840
l do. Thank you. l appreciate it.
l will file a complaint.

571
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:23,960
Now, where is that form?

572
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:29,040
Ah, yes. Ah, here we are.

573
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:34,880
Dr Finch?

574
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:38,439
Yo.

575
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:40,399
Sleigh man.

576
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:43,400
What happened? l woke up and you
were gone. What are you doing out here?

577
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:49,160
Honey, you've really been doing a lot ofwork.

578
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,000
- Yeah.
- lt looks amazing.

579
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:59,919
l guess the light thing
is pretty stupid, isn't it?

580
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,920
Oh, honey.

581
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:06,680
Yeah, it is.

582
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:09,960
lt's the stupidest thing l've ever heard.
You want our lights to be seen from space.

583
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:14,760
Certifiable.

584
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:19,760
- l'll take 'em all down tomorrow.
- You touch one bulb on that house

585
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:23,440
and you've seen the last of my special
holiday offers. You know what l mean.

586
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,799
- You said they looked stupid.
- lt's crazy.

587
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,800
But all good ideas are crazy.

588
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:33,320
- These are lights.
- Oh, come on.

589
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:37,240
l think we both know
it means more to you than just lights.

590
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,359
Who knows?

591
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:46,360
lt might turn out to be...

592
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:50,200
something monumental.

593
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:57,480
- l can always count on you, can't l?
- Sure.

594
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:05,479
Oh, cow. We'll have
buttermilk pancakes tomorrow.

595
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:08,480
- What is he up to now?
- Animals for a live manger scene.

596
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:12,119
Unbelievable. ls that a camel?

597
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:14,359
Look at that. He is sweet.

598
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:17,079
Yep. Can't wait to run my kids by.

599
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:20,080
lfyou wanna make sure they see it,
bring 'em tonight.

600
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:34,160
Let's light this candle.

601
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:42,599
What are you doing?

602
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,399
Oh, l...

603
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,559
What are you doing up anyway?

604
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:49,560
lt's late. You should go to bed.
Zip up your coat.

605
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:53,240
You're gonna cut his power, aren't you?

606
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Need a lookout?

607
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:09,720
SpongeBob, this is SquarePants.
The tiger is in the cage.

608
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:14,199
Roger that, SquarePants.

609
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:17,200
- l'm going in.
- Roger.

610
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,639
Stop!

611
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:29,640
Ashley, ouch!

612
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:33,840
This is the best Christmas ever.

613
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,439
Emily, stop.

614
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:40,440
The tiger is offthe enclosure.

615
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:02,759
What? What channel are you on? Hello?

616
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:05,760
He's coming! Hide!

617
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:13,400
Oh, good Lord.

618
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:17,040
That's disgusting.

619
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:21,160
No. No, get away from me.

620
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:37,199
Well, go, before he comes back.

621
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:40,200
Pardon me.

622
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:44,200
Yeah, l oughta...

623
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:14,880
Jackpot.

624
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:27,880
Mission accomplished.

625
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:37,840
Yeah! Yeah!

626
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:42,039
Hi, hon. Couldn't sleep?

627
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:44,679
What the hell are you doing over there?

628
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:47,680
Oh, my God. You smell.
Were you with the camel?

629
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:50,960
l did it. l did it.
The lights are off. lsn't it great?

630
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:55,840
Little help, please. Sorry, Mom.

631
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:00,519
- lt was his idea.
- Get him down right now!

632
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:03,520
All right. But, tonight, when you're getting
your best sleep in weeks, remember l did it.

633
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:08,760
The lights are off. The lights are finally...

634
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:13,760
Now we're talking!

635
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:18,640
You see that? That was a close one.
The lights went out.

636
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:22,560
Yeah. We came right over to see ifthere
was anything we could do to help, Buddy.

637
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:27,320
- What's that noise?
- Oh, that? That's the Generac-3000.

638
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:31,920
Liquid-cooled generator.
Comes in really handy in a pinch like this.

639
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:36,040
- Very handy.
- Everything seems to be in order here, honey.

640
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:40,319
l think we should go to bed.
Good night, Buddy.

641
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:43,320
Excuse me. ls that your son
dangling from that telephone pole?

642
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:46,679
Hi, Mr Hall.

643
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:49,680
- We're having him tested.
- Oh, yeah.

644
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:52,199
Well, good night. Thank you very much.

645
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:55,200
Go get him right now!

646
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:58,920
Coming, Carter.

647
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:15,480
Finch!

648
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:20,159
Where's my paper?

649
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:22,879
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

650
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:24,319
Kelly.

651
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:27,320
He's messing with the wrong hombre.
l'm making the call.

652
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:30,840
The Neighbourhood Association
are not gonna stand by with this...

653
00:46:57,120 --> 00:47:00,120
What is it?

654
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:02,879
How did this get here?

655
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:05,639
- Buddy.
- Really?

656
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:08,279
Hey, Dad. What's that car
doing in our driveway?

657
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:11,280
- lt's beautiful.
- This is awesome. l call shotgun.

658
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:15,239
lfyou don't like the colour, we can change it.

659
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:18,240
Buddy? Buddy, the tree? A car?

660
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:21,600
lt's an amazingly generous gesture,
but we can't possibly accept it.

661
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:24,599
Yeah. lt's too much.

662
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:26,879
- But we don't wanna be rude.
- Steve.

663
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:29,880
Well, l drive a car with no doors.
We live in Massachusetts. l could die.

664
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:33,920
The car is yours.
l'm not gonna take no for an answer.

665
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:37,239
After all l put you through,
that's all there is to it.

666
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:39,199
The keys are inside. Enjoy.

667
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:41,639
- Thank you so much.
- This is great.

668
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:44,640
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

669
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:53,919
l'll get the electrician to fix the fuse box.

670
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:56,920
- Yes, l think you'd better.
- l will.

671
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:31,720
Guys, what happened?

672
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,239
Vandals.

673
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:36,240
They took a chainsaw to it last night.
Stole the whole thing, decorations and all.

674
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:40,800
Gee.

675
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:51,279
Nah.

676
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:54,119
He couldn't have. lt can't be the same tree.

677
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:57,120
- Dr Finch, this is from the car dealer.
- Oh, probably the documentation...

678
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:01,880
They say you have to pay by lunchtime
or you'll be arrested.

679
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:05,040
Arrested? Arrested? But that car...

680
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:09,360
- Bob, you wanted to see me?
- Yeah. Hey, Buddy, come on in here.

681
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:12,760
Grab a seat. Let me just
send that important thing offthere.

682
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:17,040
Look, l know you think l'm young
and maybe a little inexperienced,

683
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:21,199
but the truth is you don't get to where l am

684
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:24,200
without knowing a thing or two
about the art of selling cars. Huh?

685
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:28,680
Actually, Bob, you got to where you are
because your dad owns the business.

686
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:32,480
Look, yeah, we're getting offtask here.
lt's not important.

687
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:35,840
What's important is this month's
sales figures. Theyjust came in...

688
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:39,519
Bob, l should be out there selling cars.

689
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:42,520
Whoa, hold up there.
Come on. Come on back inside here.

690
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:45,680
Look, you're a great salesman,
everybody knows that. All right?

691
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:50,120
But the problem is
your numbers are way down, Buddy.

692
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:53,400
You can't sell cars ifyou're never here.

693
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:58,199
Bob...

694
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:01,200
lt's the lights, the Christmas lights.

695
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:05,440
See, all my life
l've been looking for that one thing,

696
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:09,279
that one important thing.

697
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:12,280
And l've always quit everything l started.

698
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:17,680
l can't quit this, Bob. l gotta finish this.

699
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:23,200
Right. Well, iffinishing those lights
means more time away from work,

700
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:27,360
then you're not gonna have ajob
to come back to when you're done.

701
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:31,720
- Buddy Hall, customer in the showroom.
- Duty calls.

702
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:34,519
Hey, Steve.

703
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:37,520
What is this? Hey, what is this?
What's inside here?

704
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:40,439
l don't have my X-ray goggles with me,

705
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:43,440
but l'm guessing that's the bill
to the new car you bought.

706
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,000
l didn't buy a car. You gave me a car.
And l know about the tree.

707
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:50,840
Tree? The tree? What tree?
l don't know about any tree.

708
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:54,560
And unless they have film on it,
you don't know about any tree.

709
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:57,639
They don't have film on it, do they?

710
00:50:57,640 --> 00:51:00,640
You chopped down the town tree
and stuck it in my living room,

711
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:03,639
and you made me believe
that car was a present.

712
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:06,279
Steve, ifyou would have looked at the bill,

713
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:09,280
you'd have noticed that l shaved
my commission by almost a third,

714
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:14,120
which in most circles
is quite a substantial gift.

715
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:16,799
Well, your gift is parked outside.

716
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:19,800
Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve,
you cannot walk away from your obligations.

717
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:24,040
- You signed the contract.
- l didn't sign anything.

718
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:26,759
No, that's true. You didn't sign anything.

719
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:29,760
l had to forge your signature, otherwise
they wouldn't let me drive the car out of here.

720
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:34,640
OK, that's it, that's it.
We are going to settle this like men.

721
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:36,399
Who?

722
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:39,400
- l'm gonna contact my attorney.
- Contact your attorney?

723
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:42,440
ls the way you settle things like men?
Your mommy out oftown?

724
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:46,000
OK, that's it. You wanna go?
Let's go outside right now!

725
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:48,719
Let's do it. l'm gonna kick your ass!

726
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:50,519
Take it easy, Jackie Chan.

727
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:53,520
Relax. We're not barbarians.

728
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:58,319
What do you wanna do?

729
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:01,320
Well, there's the little Winterfest coming up.

730
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:05,880
And in the Winterfest,
there is an ice-skating race.

731
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:10,479
Yeah.

732
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:12,599
Yeah, great idea.

733
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:15,600
Great idea. You win, l buy the car.
l win, you take down the lights.

734
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:20,520
Deal.

735
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:26,800
Tree sap.

736
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:30,120
lt's a beautiful car. lt's fully loaded.

737
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:33,280
You spared no expense.

738
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:54,639
Keep your eye on the frozen ball.

739
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:57,640
l'm gonna knock the little hairs
offthat little Russian guy.

740
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:00,800
- Do it. Do it like l know you can.
- Little wooden man going down.

741
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,319
- Zingo!
- Touchdown.

742
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:07,719
Come on, son. Let's show him how it's done.

743
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:09,839
- Hello, Steve.
- Hello.

744
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:12,840
- OK. Give him five dollars, son.
- My dad's gonna win.

745
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:16,679
- Ah, southpaw.
- Watch and learn.

746
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:19,680
Look at them. Why are they working
so hard at hating each other?

747
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:22,880
l don't know. Why can't theyjust be quiet and
do it with a big smile like normal neighbours?

748
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:28,040
Yeah.

749
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:40,879
That mean man knocked down the old lady.

750
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:43,880
- He just winged her.
- That's gonna swell up.

751
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:55,239
Not too late to back out, Finch.

752
00:53:55,240 --> 00:53:58,240
- What are they doing now?
- This is just getting embarrassing.

753
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:03,359
On your mark, get set...

754
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:05,319
Wait.

755
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:08,320
They're acting like a bunch of 12 year olds.

756
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:14,080
l don't know... Let's just... l can't.

757
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:30,959
Buddy! Buddy!

758
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:33,960
You! Come on. Come with me. Come on.

759
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:37,600
- You two have tweaked my last nerve.
- She's right. This is crazy.

760
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:41,640
l don't care if it takes all day.
You're gonna stand here and work it out.

761
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:44,679
- There's nothing to work out.
- You see?

762
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:47,680
You can't talk to a guy like this.
lt's a waste oftime.

763
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:52,679
- Why'd you hit me?
- l don't know. She started it.

764
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:54,559
Don't be such babies.

765
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:57,560
This is important to us. And it better
be important to you too. Talk it out.

766
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:04,400
Talk it out.

767
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:08,119
What are we supposed to say?

768
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:11,120
- There is nothing that we could agree on.
- You got that right.

769
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:15,520
OK, everybody, now let's give
a nice, warm Winterfest welcome to...

770
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:20,120
the Santa Babies.

771
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:25,520
Now, that is something we can agree on.
l mean, that's got it going on.

772
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:30,120
Look at that.

773
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:33,760
- Well, you're a guy, right?
- Yeah, l'm a guy.

774
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:35,599
Hey! Hey!

775
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:38,600
ls it getting hot out here or is itjust you girls?

776
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:41,840
Oh, nice dip.

777
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:47,800
Yeah, that's what l'm talking about!
Hey, baby, who's your daddy?

778
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:51,839
Who's your daddy?

779
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:54,840
Who's your daddy?

780
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:58,079
Oh, God. l'm your daddy. l'm your daddy!

781
00:55:58,080 --> 00:56:01,080
- l'm your daddy. Oh, God!
- My eyes! My eyes!

782
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:04,599
My eyes. My eyes.

783
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:07,600
- We're going to hell.
- You think l don't know that?

784
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:11,640
l let myselfthink you were a normal guy
and this is what happens.

785
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:15,040
You blame me for this?
''Who's your daddy? Who's your daddy?''

786
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:18,640
The annual Winterfest speed skating races
will begin in five minutes.

787
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:26,360
ln the world of sport, it has no equal.

788
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:31,880
Modern-day gladiators
throwing caution to the wind,

789
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:35,400
risking their very lives
for a chance at immortality.

790
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:42,400
OK, so they're not risking their lives, but they
are skating pretty fast. And it's really cool.

791
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:47,360
lt's Winterfest's ninth
annual speed skating race.

792
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:52,759
OK, is that everybody?

793
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:55,519
Well, looks like somebody got cold feet.

794
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:58,520
- Let's start the race.
- Wait!

795
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:00,959
Wait.

796
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:03,960
Wait.

797
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:07,639
Very nice. Very nice suit.

798
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:10,640
Looks like you're smuggling
two chicken nuggets up there.

799
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:13,799
lt's a skin suit. l raced in college.

800
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:16,479
- Go, Dad.
- Thank you, Carter.

801
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:19,480
Dad, Dad, he's our man,
if he can't do it, nobody can. Dad!

802
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:22,839
On your mark.

803
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:25,119
- Honeys.
- Get set.

804
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:28,120
Go!

805
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:31,359
Oh! Finch is down!

806
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:34,360
Finch is down and he looks bad.

807
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:37,199
Wait. He's back up.

808
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:40,200
He's on his feet and he's skating fast,
but he's got a lot of ice to catch up.

809
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:49,240
And into the first turn,
it's Buddy Hall, Gustave and Gerta.

810
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:52,360
Finch really appears to be struggling
as he heads for the straightaway.

811
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:56,840
Wait. Mayor Eugene Young
has yet to leave the starting line.

812
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:06,040
You're going the wrong way!

813
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:09,439
Gustave and Gerta make
their move on Buddy in turn three.

814
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:11,559
And they've taken the lead.

815
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:13,759
Buddy Hall seems to be running out of gas.

816
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:16,760
The crowd urges him on,
but it may not be his day.

817
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:21,520
Wrong-way Finch slips past Gustave
and Gerta and is really pouring it on.

818
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:29,959
Finch has got to make his move now or else.

819
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:32,960
He jumps the bales,
almost taking out Buddy in the process.

820
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:36,120
Miraculously, Steve Finch has taken
the lead going into the final turn!

821
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:42,280
Steve Finch has a huge lead.

822
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:46,319
- Nothing can stop him now!
- Yeah!

823
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:49,320
Finch is sent sprawling!
Oh, the carnage.

824
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:53,200
And it's Buddy Hall by a nose!
Buddy Hall wins the race!

825
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:56,880
Buddy Hall is our new champion!

826
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:02,200
Buddy! Buddy!
Buddy! Buddy! Buddy!

827
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:06,440
Thank you. Thank you.

828
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:10,080
l will be back with the payment booklet
for your new car, Flash.

829
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:16,480
Yeah, fine, fine, but the last time
l looked at the satellite pictures,

830
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,999
you still couldn't see your house.

831
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,999
Not a flicker, not a blip.

832
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,159
How's that feel, huh? Huh?

833
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:27,799
How's it feel to be invisible?

834
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:30,800
Huh?

835
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:37,439
What?

836
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:40,440
OK, let's go over it. The LED lights, the grid,
the wires, the shipping, the handling.

837
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:46,440
Everything, the whole ball ofwax.
How much, out the door?

838
00:59:49,360 --> 00:59:51,839
How much? What?

839
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:54,159
Are you serious?

840
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:57,160
What is that? ln yen?

841
00:59:57,520 --> 01:00:00,520
ls that with the discount?

842
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:08,880
Can you get it here overnight?

843
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:16,159
Buddy! Buddy Hall!

844
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:19,160
- Hi, honey.
- This is a bad dream. This isn't happening.

845
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:22,880
No, no, l'm just going to take
a couple ofthese branches off...

846
01:00:25,320 --> 01:00:28,119
l'm not talking about the trees!

847
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:30,679
l'm talking about this.

848
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:32,999
- What's that?
- You know what this is.

849
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:36,000
This is the stand to my vase.
You pawned it, didn't you?

850
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:39,079
You pawned my grandmother's vase.

851
01:00:39,080 --> 01:00:42,080
Well, how am l supposed to afford a camel
on a car salesman's salary?

852
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:47,440
And then l went for a loan,
and ifyou don't have ajob...

853
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:50,600
You lost yourjob?

854
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:55,360
That was a pretty awkward way
for you to find that out.

855
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:59,600
But don't worry about it.
l can sell anything to anybody.

856
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:03,679
Not me. Not any more.

857
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:05,799
Honey, things are gonna get better.

858
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:08,759
When? l'm tired ofwaiting, Buddy.

859
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:11,760
Waiting for you to find the rightjob,
the right town.

860
01:01:12,120 --> 01:01:15,120
Waiting for you to find
that one true thing that makes you happy.

861
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:18,800
l think this is it.

862
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:21,559
You see, that's just the thing, Buddy.

863
01:01:21,560 --> 01:01:24,560
l just thought you might wake up one day
and see that itjust might be me.

864
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:29,760
That itjust might be your family.

865
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:32,800
You know what? l'm done.

866
01:01:33,240 --> 01:01:36,119
Oh, honey. Come on. Don't.

867
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:39,120
- Cords! Cords are everywhere!
- Please, baby... No.

868
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:41,679
Oh, no, honey.

869
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:44,680
Buddy Hall's Christmas wish
is to make his house bright enough

870
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:48,480
to be visible notjust from miles around,

871
01:01:48,560 --> 01:01:51,239
but from space.

872
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:53,239
Oh, right...

873
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:56,240
When we heard about Mr Hall's quest,
ifyou will,

874
01:01:57,120 --> 01:02:00,120
we downlinked images from his general area
as often as possible.

875
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:02,999
l can show you, ifyou'd like to take a look.

876
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:06,000
Right... Nothing yet.

877
01:02:06,040 --> 01:02:07,879
Wow. Thank you for that.

878
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:10,880
This may be one Christmas wish
even Santa can't grant.

879
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:14,880
Hi, everybody. Thanks for coming.

880
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:19,760
l'm really happy that you came tonight.
l hope you enjoy these lights,

881
01:02:21,160 --> 01:02:23,719
cos l did 'em all for you.

882
01:02:23,720 --> 01:02:25,879
And for my family.

883
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:28,880
And for my wonderful neighbours
across the street.

884
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:32,400
Thank you.

885
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:07,400
Tia!

886
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:11,239
Tia!

887
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:14,240
Come back!

888
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:46,880
lfyou missed anything,
this show is gonna be repeated

889
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:50,480
every night on a loop until 4am.

890
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:11,279
l can't take it any more.

891
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:14,280
Well, me neither, but you've
gotta take some ofthe blame.

892
01:05:15,320 --> 01:05:17,159
- You hear that?
- Yeah.

893
01:05:17,160 --> 01:05:20,160
Hear that? lt's getting louder.
He wants to play rough? l can play rough.

894
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:23,960
Steve, where are you going? Steve!

895
01:05:35,360 --> 01:05:38,360
l hear if someone's in the market
for something with a little pop,

896
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:41,599
you're the guy.

897
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:44,600
Maybe. Could be the guy.

898
01:05:46,080 --> 01:05:49,080
Depends on what you're looking for.

899
01:05:50,040 --> 01:05:53,040
Don't let the reindeer pyjamas fool you, pal.
l'm not playing around.

900
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:57,200
- l'm looking to do some serious damage.
- Yeah? Cool.

901
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:01,400
You've come to the right place. l've got
enough firepower back here for two wars.

902
01:06:07,120 --> 01:06:10,079
l got reapers, crackle dragons,

903
01:06:10,080 --> 01:06:12,439
wagon wheels, throbbing copperheads.

904
01:06:12,440 --> 01:06:15,440
- Great. l'll take 'em all.
- What's this for, man?

905
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:19,560
l'm gonna shoot them at my neighbour's
house and hopefully give him a heart attack.

906
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:24,200
Cool. ln that case, you need this.

907
01:06:34,680 --> 01:06:37,680
- The atomic warlord.
- Wow.

908
01:06:38,120 --> 01:06:41,120
Yeah.

909
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:52,600
Good night, Steve.

910
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:55,880
Good night, Buddy.

911
01:07:07,080 --> 01:07:10,080
Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse.

912
01:07:14,520 --> 01:07:17,520
You want lights, Buddy?
You want lights? l'll show you lights.

913
01:07:26,120 --> 01:07:28,559
Oh, yeah! Yeah, how do you like that?

914
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:30,679
Yeah, sleep through that, Buddy.

915
01:07:30,680 --> 01:07:33,680
Huh? Huh?

916
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:38,439
Yeah!

917
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:41,440
How's that feel, huh? Hey, you think
they can see that from space, Buddy?

918
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:46,920
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

919
01:07:48,600 --> 01:07:51,600
How does it feel to have
your whole world exploding around you?

920
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:02,239
Oh, no!

921
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:05,240
Oh, gosh.

922
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:09,960
Steve? Where are you?
What's happening? Honey?

923
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:25,399
Oh, God. l really wish that hadn't happened.

924
01:08:25,400 --> 01:08:28,400
Honey?

925
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:44,520
Kelly! Kelly!

926
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:56,040
You sure you've been watering that thing?
lt went up awfully fast.

927
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:00,000
- Are you kidding me?
- Fire extinguisher.

928
01:09:11,320 --> 01:09:14,320
Yeah, yeah. Faulty Christmas lights,
an underwatered tree.

929
01:09:15,480 --> 01:09:18,480
What can l say? We're a cautionary tale.

930
01:09:19,040 --> 01:09:22,040
So the fact you apparently purchased
an illegal-grade military firework

931
01:09:23,760 --> 01:09:26,760
and set it off in your own home
had nothing to do with it, huh?

932
01:09:27,400 --> 01:09:30,359
That could have been a contributing factor.

933
01:09:30,360 --> 01:09:32,839
What about this?

934
01:09:32,840 --> 01:09:35,840
Never seen that before in my life.

935
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:39,439
You're getting to be
a knot in my panties, mister.

936
01:09:39,440 --> 01:09:41,239
A real knot.

937
01:09:41,240 --> 01:09:44,240
All right, let's go.

938
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:49,800
Hey, kids. What are you...?

939
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:53,560
Where are you going, huh?

940
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:57,119
- Hey, Madison. What's going on?
- Father.

941
01:09:57,120 --> 01:09:59,119
Kelly. Kelly, what are you doing?

942
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:02,120
Trying to salvage
part ofthis Christmas for the kids.

943
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:04,479
Wait. You're leaving? You're lea...

944
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:07,079
Come on, it's not that bad. lt's not that bad.

945
01:10:07,080 --> 01:10:09,719
Most ofthe smoke damage
was in the family room.

946
01:10:09,720 --> 01:10:12,720
And on the bright side,
you always hated that wallpaper.

947
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:16,280
- Now that high-pressure hoses have ripped...
- We're gonna stay with Tia and the twins.

948
01:10:18,120 --> 01:10:21,120
Come on, Kelly, don't do that.
Don't let thatjerk ruin our Christmas.

949
01:10:21,960 --> 01:10:24,799
- The onlyjerk ruining Christmas is you.
- Me?

950
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:27,279
- Yeah.
- Me? l'm trying to save Christmas.

951
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:30,280
Really? What is your
favourite Christmas memory?

952
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:34,000
Well... Well, you know what it is.

953
01:10:34,080 --> 01:10:36,999
l was seven years old.
My dad and l moved to Alabama,

954
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:40,000
and on Christmas morning we woke up
and sat on the kitchen floor,

955
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:42,879
ate fries and drank chocolate milk.

956
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:45,880
Yeah, exactly. lt wasn't planned.
lt wasn't organised.

957
01:10:46,520 --> 01:10:49,279
Nobody entered it in a BlackBerry.
ltjust happened.

958
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:51,719
Our family is so busy,
we have to plan things out.

959
01:10:51,720 --> 01:10:53,719
No. You, you are the busy one.

960
01:10:53,720 --> 01:10:56,720
You said our kids needed Christmas
more than ever. No.

961
01:10:56,960 --> 01:10:59,679
What they need more than ever is you.

962
01:10:59,680 --> 01:11:02,680
Carter wanted to go
Christmas shopping with you.

963
01:11:03,240 --> 01:11:06,240
He wanted to cut down that tree with you.
And Madison, well...

964
01:11:07,040 --> 01:11:10,040
Madison's a teenage girl so she ignores you,
but ifyou'd been paying attention,

965
01:11:11,560 --> 01:11:14,560
you'd have seen that she wants you
to know she's not a little girl.

966
01:11:14,920 --> 01:11:17,119
That's a message l got pretty clear.

967
01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:19,279
You just don't get it.

968
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:22,280
Christmas traditions are born in those little
chocolate-milk-and-French-fry moments,

969
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:26,359
and you can't control it.

970
01:11:26,360 --> 01:11:29,360
We don't fit in the tiny little boxes
on your Christmas calendar.

971
01:11:32,160 --> 01:11:35,160
Oh, don't.

972
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:37,599
What will l eat?

973
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:40,600
Wait, Kelly. Don't. Wait.

974
01:11:47,560 --> 01:11:50,560
Steve. What happened to your house?
Did you have a fire?

975
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:54,519
Are you telling me
you weren't even home last night?

976
01:11:54,520 --> 01:11:57,520
No. Tia and the girls
went and stayed in a motel.

977
01:11:58,360 --> 01:12:01,360
l spent all night throwing
little pebbles at their window.

978
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:04,520
You missed the whole...

979
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:08,479
Oh, that's nothing.
That's nothing. That's just...

980
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:11,480
The kids probably left it out here last night.

981
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:15,400
lt's just a wire that goes...

982
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:18,879
l knew it. You've been stealing my power.

983
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:21,880
Borrowing. Look, it's an extension cord.
lt goes both ways.

984
01:12:22,760 --> 01:12:25,519
l was gonna shoot it back to you
after the holidays.

985
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:28,520
Fine, you win. You win.
The skating, the lights, the trees.

986
01:12:29,200 --> 01:12:32,200
You've been two steps ahead of me.
But you know what?

987
01:12:32,280 --> 01:12:34,359
You're still a screwup,

988
01:12:34,360 --> 01:12:37,360
and that doesn't change because
you put some lights on the roof.

989
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:42,279
Hey, pal.

990
01:12:42,280 --> 01:12:45,280
You're gonna be spending Christmas alone,
like the rest of us screwups.

991
01:12:46,040 --> 01:12:49,040
How do you like that?

992
01:13:03,400 --> 01:13:05,799
Tootie, where are you?

993
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:08,800
No, no. But we're luckier than lots
offamilies because we're really going.

994
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:14,599
Wait till you see the fine home
we're going to have.

995
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:17,479
And the loads and loads offriends we'll make.

996
01:13:17,480 --> 01:13:19,999
Wonderful friends.

997
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:23,000
But the main thing, Tootie,
is that we're all going to be together,

998
01:13:23,400 --> 01:13:25,839
just like we've always been.

999
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:28,119
That's what really counts.

1000
01:13:28,120 --> 01:13:31,120
We could be happy anywhere
as long as we're together.

1001
01:14:11,160 --> 01:14:14,160
l see you're taking down all the lights.

1002
01:14:14,520 --> 01:14:17,279
Oh, you noticed?

1003
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:19,759
What are you, some kind of genius?

1004
01:14:19,760 --> 01:14:22,760
Apparently not.

1005
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:26,920
l can't do it, Buddy.

1006
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:30,360
l can't spend Christmas without them.

1007
01:14:32,640 --> 01:14:34,959
Tell me about it.

1008
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:37,039
This is awful.

1009
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:39,679
lt's killing me.

1010
01:14:39,680 --> 01:14:42,680
And you know Tia.

1011
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:45,960
She's so stubborn. She won't even talk to me.

1012
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:52,600
l tried everything.

1013
01:14:55,160 --> 01:14:58,160
Maybe not everything.

1014
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:10,000
Girls, come over here
and help us decorate the tree.

1015
01:15:10,520 --> 01:15:13,520
Mom, you're hanging booze from the minibar
on a branch that you got out of a car bumper.

1016
01:15:15,480 --> 01:15:18,239
Pardon me for not being
in the Christmas spirit.

1017
01:15:18,240 --> 01:15:21,240
- We're making the best of it.
- Girls, put those books down.

1018
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:24,520
Get your butts over here.
Are you reading?

1019
01:15:25,160 --> 01:15:28,160
Emily Dickinson.
Madison gave it to us. lt's really good.

1020
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:32,239
Yeah, it's not giving me
a headache or anything.

1021
01:15:32,240 --> 01:15:35,240
Maybe l should
go to law school or something.

1022
01:15:38,720 --> 01:15:41,519
Hey, Mom, look.

1023
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:43,959
Carter, get back here.

1024
01:15:43,960 --> 01:15:46,960
l'll get him.
Carter, get back here, you little fart.

1025
01:15:53,280 --> 01:15:56,280
Mom, you won't believe this.
You guys have to come.

1026
01:15:56,600 --> 01:15:57,919
Carter.

1027
01:15:57,920 --> 01:16:00,920
lt's like a path. Let's see where it goes.

1028
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:07,079
Oh, my...

1029
01:16:07,080 --> 01:16:10,080
lt's just unbelievable.
What do you think, sweetie?

1030
01:16:11,080 --> 01:16:14,080
Mom, look at this one.

1031
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:25,880
This is amazing.

1032
01:16:26,200 --> 01:16:29,200
Take a picture!

1033
01:16:31,040 --> 01:16:34,040
l can't believe it.

1034
01:16:53,560 --> 01:16:56,560
Mom, all these lights were Dad's lights.

1035
01:16:57,920 --> 01:17:00,920
- l begged you to let me do the yams.
- You have no feeling for starches.

1036
01:17:02,600 --> 01:17:05,600
- Your three bean salad is bad.
- You expect me to do the salad

1037
01:17:06,280 --> 01:17:09,280
and the fiesta corn?

1038
01:17:10,440 --> 01:17:13,440
We thought maybe you'd be hungry.

1039
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:17,400
lfyou thought some lights and a TV dinner
would make up for all the crap that l have...

1040
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:27,640
- ls that what l think?
- We didn't have time to do a turkey.

1041
01:17:27,800 --> 01:17:30,800
So we made a few things
from your new cookbook.

1042
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:39,400
l got you this little pre-Christmas gift.

1043
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:54,760
l missed you so much.

1044
01:17:54,960 --> 01:17:57,960
Oh, gosh, how did you afford it?
How did you ever afford it?

1045
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:01,800
Let's just say we're not gonna use
our credit cards for the rest of our lives.

1046
01:18:07,240 --> 01:18:10,199
- You've been busy.
- Kelly, l'm so sorry.

1047
01:18:10,200 --> 01:18:13,200
lt's just everything got so... You think you're
doing the right things for the right reasons

1048
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:18,440
and then one day you blow up your house.

1049
01:18:19,880 --> 01:18:22,880
And it occurs to you that somewhere
along the way, things got out of hand.

1050
01:18:25,080 --> 01:18:27,319
lt seemed like your whole life got so loud

1051
01:18:27,320 --> 01:18:30,320
that the only thing you were gonna hear
was an empty house.

1052
01:18:30,440 --> 01:18:32,759
You're right.

1053
01:18:32,760 --> 01:18:35,760
You were right. And you were right to leave.

1054
01:18:36,520 --> 01:18:39,520
You were. l understand. You were all right
to leave. And l'm so glad you're back.

1055
01:18:47,200 --> 01:18:50,200
- So l can date now?
- Sailors during wartime? No.

1056
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:54,600
But you are growing up,
so l guess l have to get used to that.

1057
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:01,000
- Mr Hall, you took down all your lights.
- Yeah, l thought it would be better.

1058
01:19:02,040 --> 01:19:04,639
- l bet it would have worked.
- lt might have.

1059
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:06,799
l bet they could have seen us from space.

1060
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:09,319
We'll never know.

1061
01:19:09,320 --> 01:19:12,320
Then again, maybe you will.

1062
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:26,959
Oh, my...

1063
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:29,960
Look, l'm sorry.

1064
01:19:31,520 --> 01:19:34,520
You all have to go home.
There are no lights tonight.

1065
01:19:36,040 --> 01:19:38,799
No, but there will be.

1066
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:41,119
- Buddy, what's happening?
- l don't know.

1067
01:19:41,120 --> 01:19:44,120
l told them Buddy was short on lights
and maybe they'd like to come and help out.

1068
01:19:45,320 --> 01:19:47,399
How many people did you call?

1069
01:19:47,400 --> 01:19:50,400
You have no idea
how bad the eyesight is in this town.

1070
01:19:50,760 --> 01:19:53,760
MTV is sending someone down
to do a story on Buddy's lights.

1071
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:57,800
- They don't know he took 'em down.
- Which is why we'd better put 'em back up.

1072
01:19:58,920 --> 01:20:01,920
Are you just gonna stand there
or are you gonna help me do this?

1073
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:05,320
Let's go.

1074
01:20:23,240 --> 01:20:26,240
- Oh, it's beautiful.
- Thank you so much.

1075
01:20:29,960 --> 01:20:32,960
And keep those truck lights on too.
Those are good too.

1076
01:20:33,080 --> 01:20:36,080
Thanks for coming. lt's really nice ofyou.
Beautiful. Good to see you.

1077
01:20:40,040 --> 01:20:43,040
Steve, you're doing an excellentjob.
You got a future in this.

1078
01:20:43,400 --> 01:20:46,400
Happy holidays. SuChin Pak coming to you
live from Cloverdale, Massachusetts,

1079
01:20:48,200 --> 01:20:50,559
where the whole town has come out

1080
01:20:50,560 --> 01:20:53,560
to see if Buddy Hall, a local car salesman,
can achieve the impossible.

1081
01:20:54,560 --> 01:20:57,560
He's put up a Christmas light display
that can hopefully be seen from space.

1082
01:20:59,720 --> 01:21:02,720
The folks at MyEarth have been
monitoring the situation live.

1083
01:21:02,960 --> 01:21:05,960
Guys, thanks so much for spending
your holiday plans with us.

1084
01:21:06,440 --> 01:21:08,439
Oh, no, that's no trouble at all.

1085
01:21:08,440 --> 01:21:11,440
Basil's mum stopped by with a tin of biscuits,
so we're just having a laugh.

1086
01:21:12,480 --> 01:21:15,119
Oh, good... good times.

1087
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:18,120
They're gonna do it.
They're gonna turn on the lights.

1088
01:21:18,160 --> 01:21:21,160
All right. lt looks like
the moment has finally arrived.

1089
01:21:21,960 --> 01:21:24,039
Let's do this as a family. Come on.

1090
01:21:24,040 --> 01:21:26,959
- Put your hand on it.
- Buddy, everybody ready?

1091
01:21:26,960 --> 01:21:28,479
- Yeah.
- On the count ofthree.

1092
01:21:28,480 --> 01:21:31,480
One, two, three.

1093
01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:43,880
People worked so hard.
They're gonna be so disappointed.

1094
01:21:44,520 --> 01:21:47,520
l'm gonna go get some candles.

1095
01:21:47,800 --> 01:21:50,800
OK. All right. l need light.

1096
01:22:13,400 --> 01:22:16,400
Wanna borrow my phone?

1097
01:22:37,080 --> 01:22:40,080
Hey, Dad. Wouldn't it be great
ifwe could do this every Christmas?

1098
01:22:41,240 --> 01:22:43,319
What do you think?

1099
01:22:43,320 --> 01:22:46,320
Yeah. Yeah, we could use
some new traditions around here.

1100
01:22:48,320 --> 01:22:51,320
Buddy, l really like this town.

1101
01:22:51,720 --> 01:22:54,720
Do you think maybe you could ask
for yourjob back and we could stay here?

1102
01:22:55,760 --> 01:22:57,839
- Yeah, l like it too.
- You do?

1103

1104
01:23:05,080 --> 01:23:08,080
Hey, Steve, l know everything got really crazy,

1105
01:23:08,200 --> 01:23:11,200
but l just wanted you to know
that when we first met, l wasn't lying.

1106
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:14,679
l really did want to be your friend.

1107
01:23:14,680 --> 01:23:17,680

01:23:21,320 --> 01:23:23,199

The house is clearly visible from space!

1116
01:24:46,280 --> 01:24:49,280
Oh, my God.
