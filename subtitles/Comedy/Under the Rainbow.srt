1
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,034
I was in a forest.

2
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,559
I couldn't find my way.

3
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,913
I was hopelessly lost.

4
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,840
It kept getting darker.

5
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,553
I started to panic.

6
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:02,079
I thought,
I'll never find my way again.

7
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,271
UNDER THE RAINBOW

8
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,231
And then... I see a man,

9
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,350
stock still,

10
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:11,120
looking at me,
with so much kindness.

11
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:14,278
He reaches out,
and I go to him, without thinking.

12
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,835
And someone is behind him.
Like an angel.

13
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,553
He <i>is</i> an angel.

14
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,399
Pointing at him.

15
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,873
He carries me up and away.

16
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,436
Wait, the angel carries you?

17
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,550
No, the man.

18
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,637
Then he and I are flying.

19
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,353
On a horse, but a weird one,
with a bird's head.

20
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,596
A hippogriff.

21
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,156
A horse with a bird's head.

22
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,033
It's called a hippogriff.

23
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,834
So we're flying,

24
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,472
flying over the countryside.

25
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,513
And suddenly I felt great.
I was confident.

26
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,593
All my fear was gone.

27
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,598
And we fly over my home,

28
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,473
and I see my dad as tiny.

29
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,875
Really tiny!

30
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,032
Waving his arms, yelling to me.

31
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,674
Not that way!

32
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,030
Not that way!

33
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,040
"Not that way!"

34
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,279
Stop that, Lauranie!

35
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,675
Give me those...

36
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,038
...wands.
This is not a game.

37
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:16,358
Look! Now it's broken.
It won't work anymore!

38
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,076
And the flowers, the pumpkins!
I'm not picking them up!

39
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,517
Mathieu, Lulu! You hear me?

40
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,754
Nina is so absorbed.

41
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:30,395
Stock still,
totally into her book.

42
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,113
Yeah, it's the Bible.

43
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,114
- The Bible?
- Yes.

44
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,709
Every chance she gets,
she reads the Bible.

45
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,436
- Your dream?
- That's all I remember.

46
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,710
It's idiotic, but I was thinking...

47
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:46,678
there's a chance
it will never happen to me.

48
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,916
What?

49
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,553
I woke up and I thought,

50
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,433
I've never really felt that.

51
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,870
I've never been carried away
like that.

52
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,478
I've never really loved. I...

53
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,831
never really loved someone.

54
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,233
It got me so depressed.

55
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,873
Come on,
you're so young, you have time!

56
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,952
Nothing but bad luck lately.

57
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,639
Yeah, what can you do?

58
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,760
I had the 4 and the 11.

59
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,951
4th time in a row I had 2.

60
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:20,712
That's the trifecta.
You need 3, that's the whole point.

61
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,871
Anyway,
there are more dire things.

62
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,710
Right.

63
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,237
- My condolences, Pierre.
- Thank you.

64
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,276
You hadn't seen your dad
in how long?

65
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,960
I was just wondering that,
last night.

66
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,230
I don't know...

67
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,640
2 or 3 months, I guess.

68
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,793
I feel nothing.

69
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,594
I hadn't seen him in ages,
but it affects me.

70
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,997
Affects you.
Because you decided it would.

71
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,839
My father was nothing to you.

72
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,556
He was not nothing to me.
What does that mean?

73
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,755
Don't exaggerate.

74
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,955
He's your dad.
He was always there for Sandro.

75
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,117
And he was very shaken.

76
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,030
Where is Sandro?

77
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,917
Did you ask him about the deposit?

78
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,399
I didn't get a chance.

79
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,953
We buried someone. You notice?

80
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,275
What deposit?

81
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,356
Well...

82
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,599
I either live at Mum's till I'm 50,
or rent a place.

83
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,870
Pierre!

84
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,511
Oh, I loved your father so!

85
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,472
- Be strong, OK?
- Yeah.

86
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,353
You can still talk to him.

87
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,473
He hears you.

88
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,592
- You'll talk to him?
- Sure.

89
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,837
In any case, you'll see him soon.

90
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,720
- You must speak to him.
- Yes, I will.

91
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,275
That's good.

92
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:04,155
Madame Irma. She still exists?

93
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,350
Apparently.

94
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,036
And still sick.

95
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,119
You remember the date?

96
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,520
Date?

97
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,120
Of your death, remember?

98
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,435
Come on!

99
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,515
How should I remember that crap?

100
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,915
Date of your death?

101
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,633
No, it's horseshit.

102
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:25,480
A crazy lady
who used to do everyone's horoscope.

103
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,954
It's nonsense.

104
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,358
So... when is it?

105
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,834
I said I can't recall.

106
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,191
I can. It made an impression on me.

107
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,710
Not that I believe it.
Sure, it's horseshit but...

108
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,194
it makes an impression.

109
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,874
There they are, I'm off.

110
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:45,394
You're off?
Aren't you coming to Odette's?

111
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,113
Certainly not.

112
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,835
Come by the office,
talk about the deposit?

113
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,674
- Your girlfriend has kids?
- As you can see.

114
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,200
Can't be fun for you.

115
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,549
No, it isn't.

116
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,194
I'm parked at the corner.

117
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,516
Pull it up!

118
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,915
Pull the handle up,
the thingy will fall.

119
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,276
This is great.

120
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,791
Enough room for a vegetable garden.

121
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:40,359
You said a tiny garden.
It's not so tiny.

122
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,393
No, don't drink the water!

123
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,713
It's supposedly drinkable, but...

124
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,958
Which reminds me,
Eric said he might stop by.

125
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,357
Tell him the water's back,
but it's brown.

126
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,833
Nina, I'm leaving!

127
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,909
That's my mum, I'm not taking it.

128
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,679
Did her operation go well?

129
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,917
Hands aren't easy, I'm told.

130
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,520
That's her again.

131
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:09,155
If I answer,
we'll just argue as usual.

132
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,430
Nina!

133
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:15,519
She won't say goodbye.
The Red Sea must be parting.

134
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,116
You free Saturday?

135
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,320
Not Saturday.
That's the Princes' Ball.

136
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:23,080
- You never showed me your dress.
- Right!

137
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,759
Actually, there are two.

138
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,872
I loved them, so I got both.

139
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,796
I don't really want to go.

140
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,910
Why?

141
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:34,078
Your dream might be an omen.
You could meet someone.

142
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,396
That's exactly
what Mrs Bérard said.

143
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,239
Is she your fortune teller?

144
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,238
Well, she's a radiesthesist.

145
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,554
Hello, Ma'am.
A survey on the fears of the French.

146
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,080
No, thanks!

147
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,160
Hello. A survey...

148
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,470
The crisis.

149
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,398
This is a time of crisis.

150
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,034
Terrorism.

151
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,949
Unemployment.

152
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,636
Poverty, disease.

153
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,514
Like I said, the climate.

154
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,040
It's all mixed up.

155
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,153
Winter in summer,
summer in winter.

156
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,480
Summer in winter.

157
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,795
Well, thanks.

158
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,240
You're welcome.

159
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,154
I'm not working enough.

160
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,919
I have to work on the recital!
My goddamn father!

161
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,838
What's he got to do with it?

162
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:31,590
Here I am doing stupid surveys.
Will he lift a finger?

163
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,996
He runs a driving school.
Is he rich?

164
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,634
No, but...

165
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,356
My grandfather just died.
Left him money, he could help.

166
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,915
Every single time,
I have to beg him.

167
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,358
For the deposit,
I have to get on my knees.

168
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,352
The grandfather you liked?

169
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,910
Going to the party?

170
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,110
What party?

171
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,471
The princes' ball, on Saturday.

172
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,592
I have a quintet rehearsal.

173
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,234
Shit, you're rehearsing.

174
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,760
Why? You're going?

175
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,472
Well I don't know...

176
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,634
I won't know anyone.

177
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,559
Julien's brothers got comps.

178
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,320
Frankly,
I don't feel like going but...

179
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,716
Without you...

180
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:25,674
They might finish early.
I could meet you there.

181
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,632
I was sure you were going.

182
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,351
I'll try to skip a movement.

183
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,715
Could totally suck.

184
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:48,594
It could always totally suck.
Why do anything?

185
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,154
Just come and see.

186
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,158
- Got to go!
- Later!

187
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,990
You know them, it's your milieu.
I don't.

188
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,600
I'll feel like an idiot.

189
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,996
My milieu? Don't go overboard.

190
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,713
You're not from the jungle.

191
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:04,833
And you have to dress.
I don't own a suit.

192
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,634
You don't need one.
Got a black jacket?

193
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,798
Anyway, on Saturdays
I have to pick up my mum.

194
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,276
Pick up your mum?

195
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,915
She works Saturday nights.
I drive her home.

196
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,230
She's afraid she'll get mugged.

197
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:21,194
So at midnight, in any case,
I'll have to split.

198
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,274
Where's your dad?

199
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,356
He's in the cemetery.

200
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,233
When does he go to heaven?

201
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,555
Heaven? No.

202
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,196
No, he'll stay in the cemetery...

203
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:50,360
- Morgane, eat your carrots.
- I'm eating them!

204
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,639
Are you going to die?

205
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,355
Sure, one day. We all die.

206
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,914
So when do you die?

207
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,315
I have no idea.

208
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,590
Enough, Johanna.

209
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,995
Doesn't bother me.

210
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,192
Stop, you'll break your glass!

211
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,959
Eat your vegetables.

212
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,150
I'm eating them!

213
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:10,351
Will you go to heaven when you die?

214
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,472
You don't go to heaven when...

215
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,513
You stay in a sort of...

216
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,839
Like... Like in a box.

217
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,472
Can't hear myself talk!

218
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,240
- Got any olive oil?
- On the right.

219
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,478
It's not the body.
The spirit goes to heaven.

220
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,831
And there you meet
everyone you knew.

221
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,714
People think you go to heaven,
because they need

222
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,479
to believe in an afterlife.

223
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,590
But no.

224
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,236
You turn into a skeleton.
You've seen those before, right?

225
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,591
The skin goes and the bones remain.

226
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,076
Personally, I think we go to heaven.

227
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,750
The truth is, no one knows.
You do as you see fit.

228
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,797
Put that glass down!

229
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,272
No way I drink that water!

230
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:55,199
Or even wash with it.
Washing with brown water!

231
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,073
It's not dirty, it's rust.

232
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,237
I don't wash with rust.

233
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,476
It won't last.

234
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,958
There you go. It works.

235
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,357
For more heat, press here.

236
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,550
Minus, plus.

237
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,917
This button. Minus, plus.

238
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,556
Got it?

239
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,357
If it turns off... It won't.

240
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,632
But if it does,
press here, with the flame.

241
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,433
I'll never remember.

242
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,550
Fine.

243
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:24,076
Well, I'll say goodbye to Nina.

244
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,880
Yeah, I remember.

245
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,957
He's the first one who...

246
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,870
Isn't John the Baptist
from Jesus' family?

247
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,550
No! Jesus has no family.
Even his parents aren't his parents.

248
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:37,796
Oh I see.

249
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,278
- Know what "Jesus" means?
- Tell me Tuesday.

250
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,039
It means "saviour".

251
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,278
She keeps scratching. Notice?

252
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,074
She never stops.

253
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,032
Then sometimes not at all.

254
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,279
It's very psychosomatic.

255
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,916
Right. Everything is psychosomatic.

256
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,918
Well everything is!

257
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,078
I didn't say it,
the dermatologist did.

258
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,154
I don't get it. I clicked OK.

259
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,920
And it says to enter my code again.

260
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,355
Enter it.

261
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,235
All right.

262
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,035
I enter it...

263
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,231
And it says "incorrect code".

264
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:23,114
I don't know.
Maybe you spelled it wrong.

265
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:26,312
Wait, I know.
It might be another one.

266
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,272
What? You have several codes?

267
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,914
Sure! I have a code for...

268
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:32,794
Why? Use one code!
I only have one code.

269
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:35,071
Shit, that one didn't work either!

270
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:39,594
Take a look?
I know there's a way to...

271
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,120
Why don't you look?

272
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:45,439
For once, pick up a manual.
Say, "I can do this. I'm no dummy."

273
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,199
Objects don't hate me!

274
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,390
Like an old lady!

275
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:51,718
Want to end up like my mum,
who can only push on or off?

276
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:54,036
Is that your technological aim?

277
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,640
Seriously, Marianne!

278
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,877
Fine. I asked because you were here!

279
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,356
Finding your new man's email
is no fun.

280
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,711
He was never my man.
And I no longer see him!

281
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,878
But fine, no problem.
I'll figure it out.

282
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,349
It's no joke.

283
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,832
She really wants a first communion.

284
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:22,912
Nina!
She wants a first communion.

285
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,597
You quit med school.
What did Dad say?

286
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,313
Not a word...

287
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,396
What's your point?

288
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,955
He was disappointed but he let you.

289
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:43,118
This is the same.
It's fine for her to do this.

290
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:47,393
It will give her time to find
what she really wants to do.

291
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:50,240
Don't answer for her.
I'm talking to Laura.

292
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,751
That's right. A gap year.

293
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,156
And that was your own idea?

294
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,350
Sure.

295
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,391
Incredible. You don't like
what she does, you look at me.

296
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,591
Your daughter keeps scratching.

297
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,032
"The Casseul Empire Shaken."

298
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,514
Listen, no.

299
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:13,394
Don't bother. Thanks.
Talk to you later.

300
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,200
What was that?

301
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,800
Pain in my ass!

302
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,951
Thierry.
Any article that skewers me,

303
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,958
he just has to read it to me.

304
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,196
Enough!

305
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,912
It's been 2 weeks! I know about it.

306
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,636
They're sick. "An Empire Shaken"!

307
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,513
They have no right!

308
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,996
They can't just print that bull!

309
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,193
Don't worry, darling.

310
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,514
I am worried.

311
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,433
About time! I called twice!

312
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,756
Don't yell at me! I hurried.

313
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,280
My phone's off.

314
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,914
What good is a cell phone?

315
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,633
Get on. I have to get back.

316
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:37,073
I ask you to pick me up once,
it's like pulling teeth!

317
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,236
Where's your shoe?

318
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:40,238
Strap your helmet. I got a party!

319
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:43,239
Is it a shoeless party?
Why are you missing a shoe?

320
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,591
<i>The Casseul Inc. empire is shaken.</i>

321
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,918
<i>The CEO, Vincent Casseul,
and 4 executives,</i>

322
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,838
<i>accused of massive toxic...</i>

323
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,679
Pierre? What's the matter?

324
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,235
I just got in. Everything all right?

325
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,510
Go ahead.

326
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,879
Oh, that's why.

327
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,311
So you're actually interested.

328
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:11,159
You don't believe in that.
You're reason incarnate.

329
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,195
If you can't remember, I won't say.

330
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,632
March 14th.

331
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,837
This one. This year.

332
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,314
Oh I see.

333
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,671
No. Just asking.
I wanted to know.

334
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,477
Had a little trouble sleeping.

335
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,118
You don't have to tell me that.

336
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,749
Of course!

337
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,395
Of course it's horseshit.
I'm just curious.

338
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,274
You reminded me of it
at the cemetery and...

339
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:53,355
So I'm feeling a little guilty
about Sandro.

340
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:56,120
I'm thinking he must be waiting,
all alone.

341
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:00,154
Then, I see him dancing
with this incredible girl.

342
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:02,875
And from then on,
hypnotised, under her spell.

343
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,753
She approached me.

344
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,755
I didn't get it.

345
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,109
She liked you.

346
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,799
These things happen.

347
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,070
Can we start?

348
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:16,713
In any case,
I don't even have her number.

349
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:19,309
- Seriously?
- Seriously.

350
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,999
You're weird.

351
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,236
Can we start?

352
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,593
There, great.

353
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,874
No! Don't cover his butt,
cover his face!

354
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,230
Now...

355
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,399
Hang on. A little over...

356
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,670
There. Good.

357
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,837
My wand. Or this won't work.

358
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,430
No, not now.

359
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,679
Not too noisy?

360
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,554
I gave them 5 minutes.

361
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,716
No, it's fine.

362
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,111
Joanna wants you to say good night.

363
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:44,916
Really?

364
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,399
- Yeah.
- Oh my.

365
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:48,910
What?

366
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:51,796
No, I...

367
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,634
I don't know how.

368
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,760
To say good night?

369
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:58,440
It's uncomfortable. What do I say?

370
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,358
- Are you kidding?
- No.

371
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,593
You kiss her, say "Good night."

372
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,270
Well...

373
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,390
All right.

374
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:18,713
Maybe it was a bad idea
to come here with the kids.

375
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:19,796
Why?

376
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,115
We put you out.

377
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,800
Not at all.
It's not like that.

378
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:24,990
It's fine.

379
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:30,160
No, we're putting you out.
You were alone, 3 of us move in.

380
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,192
Eléonore, I said it's fine.

381
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:36,280
Come on. I can take it.

382
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,154
I can adjust
for 3 or 4 months, without...

383
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:42,432
Three months, barely.
I move in on March 14th.

384
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,120
March 14th?

385
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,435
That's right.

386
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,677
- How about that?
- What?

387
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,035
Well it's...

388
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,319
That's very precise.

389
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:59,157
That's the date on the lease.

390
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,869
Hopefully, it'll be ready on time.

391
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,430
I'm exhausted.

392
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,274
I wanted to kill Morgane tonight.
So annoying!

393
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,909
So is Joanna, in her own way.

394
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:20,269
They're kids. Kids are annoying.

395
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:24,518
They demand attention,
every second. It fries your brain.

396
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:27,271
You repeat yourself over and over.

397
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:30,677
It's animal training. Awful.
That's undeniable.

398
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:36,120
I mean, when you look at it head on.

399
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,113
Head on, that's how it is.

400
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,836
No, Laura. Don't confuse things.

401
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,839
I do argue with your dad,
we have differing views.

402
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:14,950
But I'm sure.

403
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:17,914
I know he's incapable
of doing such a thing.

404
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:20,396
Polluting,
knowingly and voluntarily.

405
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,715
No, it's nonsense.

406
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:25,117
The lady I see told me,
"Ordeals await you."

407
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,594
Your fortune teller?

408
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,189
Not a fortune teller,
a radiesthesist.

409
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:31,630
I swear,
everything she said is true.

410
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:32,910
Yeah? Like what?

411
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:35,475
That ordeals awaited me.

412
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,759
That I was too sensitive.

413
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:41,312
I had a burning need to be loved.

414
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,279
That I lacked confidence.

415
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,752
And that I'd meet
the man of my dreams.

416
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,998
Why don't you ask her
where your musician is?

417
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,554
She's not a dowser.

418
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,399
I know one who is.

419
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,795
You do?

420
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:57,956
Nina?

421
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,432
It's your father. Come down!

422
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,154
Now you tell me.

423
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,600
- Couldn't you warn me?
- They just called.

424
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,639
I can't turn work down.

425
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,396
What is it?

426
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,955
Voice work.
For a shampoo.

427
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,230
Eco-friendly.

428
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:20,391
So I'd keep her till Thursday night?

429
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,314
Fine, what else can I say?

430
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:30,072
The blue tube is... in any case.

431
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:33,637
The yellow one
is if it itches really, really bad.

432
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,395
Oh and...

433
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,474
I said no, but...

434
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:40,236
if she has a fit,
she sleeps with that.

435
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:42,431
This is getting hard to take.

436
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,794
OK, bye.

437
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,274
Bye, and thanks.

438
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:09,957
I have to concentrate
full time on my music,

439
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,639
if I want to make it.

440
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:16,270
You, instead of a bank,
you go see your dad.

441
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,840
Mum told me...

442
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:26,037
that Grandpa left you something.

443
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,916
Here, this is for the deposit.

444
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:38,032
About the rest, I'll think it over.

445
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,993
Got a minute for...?

446
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,994
Excuse me. Do you have a minute...?

447
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,554
Excuse me...

448
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:20,954
TWO MONTHS LATER...

449
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:36,396
"It's easier to split an atom

450
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,000
"than a prejudice."

451
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,998
According to Einstein.

452
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,637
I would also agree with him

453
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,035
that a rumour

454
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,800
is harder to combat

455
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,149
than an entire army.

456
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,234
Relax, he'll be here.

457
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,556
His rehearsal was over at 4:30.

458
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,114
He should be here.

459
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:56,356
He'll be here.

460
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,640
That's enough talk.

461
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:01,594
Now it's time to get down
to serious matters.

462
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,749
Bravo, daddykins.

463
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:16,113
Where the hell is Sandro?

464
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,471
He's working, constantly.

465
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,193
His audition is coming up.

466
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,640
Plus those surveys.

467
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,878
Why not give him money?

468
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,150
Out of principle?

469
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,595
Yes, principle.

470
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:35,115
Why are we here?
"So the parents can meet."

471
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,674
Isn't that 19th-century?

472
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:39,554
Not just the 19th century.
Nowadays, too.

473
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:43,037
They met a month ago.
The parents have to meet already?

474
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:46,790
It's been two months.
And this is the occasion.

475
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:49,480
Don't start, Pierre.
I'm begging you.

476
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:53,278
I think it's fun.
I never saw a Legion of Honour.

477
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,596
Didn't quote me once in your speech.

478
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,313
What should I have said?

479
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,799
Let me congratulate you.

480
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,673
I'm very happy for you.

481
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,234
You might have said...

482
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,877
"I congratulate my sister.

483
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,872
"An actress unjustly ignored,

484
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,072
"she brings my life
all the humanity it needs."

485
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,475
Oh, Mr Alexis!

486
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:14,829
Seen my bracelet?

487
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,191
Yes. Really pretty.

488
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,274
He can't afford better.

489
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:22,393
Which I like.
He's so real-life, it's refreshing.

490
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:25,160
He struggles all day,
thinks only about music.

491
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,270
He was cute...

492
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,915
Do you have any drinkable red wine?

493
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:33,391
Then go and see!
Wait.

494
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,240
Want to order?

495
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:40,317
Hello. I'm fine, thanks.

496
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:42,875
Sandro, my dad. Dad, Sandro.

497
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,195
Pleasure.

498
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,359
I thought he was a waiter.

499
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,874
Hello, sir.

500
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:51,596
How are you?

501
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,473
Did your parents come with you?

502
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,356
No, I'll go get them.

503
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,356
Does he stutter, or am I...

504
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,800
I knew you'd say that.

505
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,479
He does? I didn't notice.

506
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:05,590
Marianne!

507
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,873
What are you doing?

508
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,231
Getting bored silly. Why?

509
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:16,279
Mum, come on.
We're over here with Laura and...

510
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,115
You have a license.

511
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:23,152
I have the license, but...

512
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:26,717
I haven't driven in so long.
I need to regain confidence.

513
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,433
I've moved out of town.

514
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:33,038
You see?
Now I absolutely have to...

515
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,673
I have a car I don't use.

516
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:38,634
It's parked outside, I don't use it.
Seriously.

517
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:39,955
Rules of the road?

518
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,480
Basically, I know them.

519
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:44,559
No, not basically.
The rules are important.

520
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:48,274
Anyway, if you want
I could give you lessons.

521
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:49,870
Nice of you.

522
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,479
Rehearsal go OK?

523
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,034
Yeah, fine. Fine.

524
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,240
But I missed you.

525
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,919
So did I.

526
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:00,236
I didn't hear a word my dad said.

527
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,715
Your mother is so young.

528
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,069
Not that young.

529
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,114
I have to get back.

530
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:22,233
It's funny.
He wet the bed until the age of 15.

531
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:24,511
A lot of people told me that...

532
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:28,680
that and stuttering
often go together.

533
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,519
But why? I mean...

534
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:33,277
It happens
to converted left-handers.

535
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,754
But he's a righty! So...

536
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,315
No one knows.

537
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:41,233
Or some childhood trauma,
they say that often.

538
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:45,754
As far as I know, frankly,
he wasn't particularly traumatised.

539
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,997
However you bring them up is wrong.

540
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:51,352
Excuse me,
I must tell my husband something.

541
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,949
I turn around and I see Sandro,
staring back

542
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:56,197
with an angel pointing him out.

543
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:59,518
Because there was this statue
behind him, a finger

544
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:00,790
pointing at him.

545
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,673
The fortune teller said that?

546
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,553
No, it was my dream.

547
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:06,990
I see,
but the fortune teller said it.

548
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:10,632
She's not a fortune teller,
but yes she said it.

549
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:14,234
You remember
I didn't want to go to that party.

550
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:16,192
I remember. Do you?

551
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,595
Girl's totally nuts.

552
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:20,679
Come on...
But how old is her mother?

553
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:21,870
That's her mother?

554
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:26,040
You're the fairest of them all.
As usual.

555
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:29,673
Don't bother.
My father believes in nothing.

556
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:32,269
This is verified. They're facts.

557
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,915
Facts... They're coincidences.

558
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,360
Anyway, anyway...

559
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:39,472
what we wanted to say is...

560
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:43,149
we're getting engaged on...

561
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,914
March 14th.

562
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:49,069
We had said the 13th,
but it was a Friday.

563
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,354
I was wondering,

564
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,358
is there some medicine...?

565
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,920
No connection.

566
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:17,231
But since I have these thoughts
that keep coming back,

567
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,955
I thought maybe
there's some drug to...

568
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,952
get rid of them, stop them.

569
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,440
What kind of thoughts?

570
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,399
Not the thoughts themselves.

571
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:33,797
It's how they keep coming back,
all the time.

572
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:39,836
Listen,
I can't help, I'm a podiatrist.

573
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:43,317
But I know a good therapist.
Want his address?

574
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,793
No, I was just asking.

575
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:47,796
No, I'm fine.

576
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:49,790
It's just...

577
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:54,198
I'm a little tense right now.
That can't help.

578
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,633
I got people at the house.

579
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:59,550
Tiresome...

580
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:03,033
Yes. Getting back to your feet,
the soles.

581
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:05,470
Wear them every day,
or the pain returns.

582
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,354
Isn't love beautiful?

583
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,994
I'm not objective.

584
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:23,236
Meaning?

585
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:30,516
Really?

586
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,430
I get it.

587
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,719
I didn't know.

588
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,638
I meant it ironically.

589
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,717
I don't think love is so great.

590
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:48,356
Some detail you get attached to,
fabricating a myth.

591
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,956
- Don't you agree?
- Not at all.

592
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,480
Of course not.

593
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,192
I must not be very perceptive.

594
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,240
I didn't see a thing.

595
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:01,953
No one saw a thing.

596
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:07,151
Think you'll be destroyed for long?

597
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:10,510
Lots of charming guys around,
you know?

598
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:13,235
- Like you?
- Yes, good example.

599
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,158
- You don't believe in love.
- No.

600
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:18,034
But... I believe in friendship.

601
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,879
I hate seeing you like that.

602
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:39,960
Kiss her already!

603
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:45,675
What did we say?
I tap my wand and he turns into...?

604
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,360
- Prince Charming.
- Right, and kiss her!

605
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:53,640
Come on, not this again.

606
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:56,559
You wanted to be Prince Charming
and now...

607
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:59,878
you won't kiss her.
That's not charming, sorry!

608
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,912
You too! Everybody!

609
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:04,953
Get into character!
You have to believe a little!

610
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,480
Lulu, same thing!

611
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:09,559
Each time you offer the apple,
you look apologetic.

612
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,120
You're a witch.
So act like a witch a little!

613
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:15,118
I don't like being a witch.

614
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:17,391
Oh? What do you want to be?

615
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,510
A tree.

616
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:19,756
A tree?

617
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,235
Get to the right.

618
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,231
Right. Right!

619
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:32,079
Get to the right! The right!

620
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:38,350
Excuse me, I'm sorry. Sorry.

621
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,119
OK, we're all right, but...

622
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:42,914
when I grab the wheel,
you have to let me.

623
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,077
You fought me, you can't fight.

624
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,032
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry!

625
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:54,280
How long has it been
since you drove?

626
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,914
I don't know, 10 years.

627
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:58,271
Sure, but even then,
it was the same.

628
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,595
I was paralysed.

629
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:01,313
I thought I was more mature.

630
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:04,880
That I'd be more at ease.
But it's like before.

631
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,310
I'm paralysed... terrified.

632
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:08,954
No reason to be terrified.

633
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:11,800
There is!
I keep feeling I'm going to die.

634
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,400
Or else kill people.

635
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:16,756
It's a fantasy.

636
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,109
I understand.

637
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:21,229
A fantasy, but that's just it.

638
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:22,909
It is a fantasy.

639
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,357
You can't always just submit.

640
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:27,472
Take control, we're not children.

641
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,956
We must be capable
of taking control.

642
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:32,790
Right.

643
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,912
That's what I'm trying to do.

644
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:40,559
Maybe acupuncture,
at the same time, could help.

645
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:42,194
Maybe it will relax me.

646
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,356
Well, in any case, thanks.

647
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,712
For dropping me off.

648
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,911
No problem, it's on my way.

649
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:55,874
- See you Thursday?
- Right. Thursday.

650
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:01,437
- Sure you won't have coffee?
- No, I'm fine. Thanks.

651
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:03,199
See? That's my car.

652
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,550
See you Thursday.

653
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:09,875
Thursday.

654
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:49,630
Excuse me...

655
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,593
Excuse me, I'm lost.

656
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:58,235
I'm going to Rue des Acacias.
Lost my way.

657
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:00,272
Rue des Acacias?
I'm going there.

658
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,800
Can I drop you?

659
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,593
No. Thank you, but...

660
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:06,280
I wanted to walk. I've been there,

661
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:07,595
but I always drove.

662
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:09,313
Now I'm completely lost.

663
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:10,836
All right.

664
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:14,031
It depends
what you expect from life.

665
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,599
If you want to go fast,
no time to lose,

666
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:21,875
if you know exactly what you want,
it's straight ahead, then right.

667
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:28,152
But if you're more of a dreamer,
open to the unknown, a thinker,

668
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:29,555
that way.

669
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:32,960
It's longer, but much prettier.

670
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:35,398
It's called "Needle Way".

671
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:39,796
Well thanks.

672
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:41,149
Don't mention it.

673
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:48,916
I'm waiting to see which way you go.

674
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:07,274
I got totally lost.

675
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:10,313
I cut through the woods.
I got all turned around.

676
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:13,080
Fortunately,
this guy straightened me out.

677
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:15,754
He wanted to drive me.

678
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:18,671
He was strange. Know what he said?

679
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,678
This corkscrew is impossible.

680
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:22,510
Hello.

681
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:25,558
Was it pretty? Like the walk?

682
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:28,113
You know each other?

683
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:32,200
He's the one.
The man who gave me directions.

684
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:35,996
This is Maxime. My neighbour.

685
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:37,630
I mentioned him.

686
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,831
Laura, my darling niece.

687
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:40,916
Laura...

688
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:42,994
Want some wine?

689
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:44,190
Sure.

690
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:55,836
I'll go, Marianne.

691
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:57,110
You can stay.

692
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:58,754
I have to go anyway.

693
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:01,920
A pleasure, Laura.
Maybe see you soon?

694
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:03,394
Yes, maybe.

695
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:08,514
Tomorrow your life changes.
You'll have a 21st-century corkscrew.

696
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:10,120
One that unscrews corks.

697
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:15,640
Thanks for the extension cord!

698
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:21,796
He's great.

699
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:24,318
You know he's in music?

700
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:26,113
Really? What does he do?

701
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:28,596
I don't know,
I didn't really get it.

702
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:31,076
I know he writes articles.

703
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:33,478
Critiques... I don't know.

704
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:36,718
And he works for a festival.
Or an orchestra.

705
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:39,150
I can't recall, but he's in music.

706
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:41,876
Funny.

707
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:44,198
- Pretty, right?
- Yeah.

708
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:53,712
"Hi, Mum! Hi, Laura!"

709
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:54,910
How are you, Laura?

710
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:00,592
I have no idea what's wrong.

711
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:04,350
It's been 2 hours.
She won't talk, won't answer.

712
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,356
The Bible's not doing her any good.

713
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:09,039
I'll go say hello.

714
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:16,877
In any case,
I know when this shit got into her.

715
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:23,354
Well then, please Eric, let's do it.
Let's at least try.

716
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:26,996
- We'll go see Devaux, the 3 of us.
- No, please.

717
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:28,998
What's so terrible?

718
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:30,954
What are you afraid of?

719
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:32,753
I'm afraid of nothing.

720
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:37,554
I won't go see some guy
with his own ideas about parenting

721
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:40,639
so he can drum us full
of his personal morality! What a bore!

722
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:42,752
You don't know, you never tried.

723
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:45,472
And this is for Nina.

724
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:48,160
Not for you.
I'm not trying to convince you.

725
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:50,830
Try.

726
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:53,437
A shrink can tell me nothing new.

727
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:59,358
It's our separation
that Nina can't stand.

728
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:05,952
Are you doing so much better
since you started therapy?

729
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:10,034
Yes, I'm doing better.

730
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,754
<i>Hundreds of dead fish.
Utter devastation.</i>

731
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:16,679
<i>Local people all point
to upriver Casseul Industries,</i>

732
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:18,473
<i>saying they fill these waters</i>

733
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:20,314
<i>with toxic waste.</i>

734
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:21,874
<i>CEO Guillaume Casseul</i>

735
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,550
<i>denies his company had a role
in this ecological disaster,</i>

736
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:28,878
<i>but the company stock price
took a plunge...</i>

737
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,150
Mum?

738
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:34,554
Mum, could I take this
to Dad's tomorrow?

739
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:35,955
You're not going.

740
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:39,198
He called.
He can't. Something came up.

741
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:45,350
Come on.

742
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:49,235
I mentioned it, I didn't call him.
It just came up.

743
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:51,035
He'll feel obliged.

744
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:54,915
He'll think I put you up to it.
I don't care if he comes!

745
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:56,599
Hardly knows I make music!

746
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:58,837
And if it's so he can scowl

747
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:01,716
like at the Legion of Honour,
no thanks!

748
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:03,797
I said it just came up.

749
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:07,038
I said Sandro's concert is soon.
I didn't say to come.

750
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:09,360
"Sandro's concert."

751
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:11,996
What? It's not your concert?

752
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:14,396
It's a finals recital.

753
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:16,951
There are others. It's not just me.

754
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:21,120
I say "Sandro's concert," too.
We don't care about the others.

755
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:22,993
Did Laura hear it already?

756
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:24,270
Did she like it?

757
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:27,677
He won't let me. He wants me
to hear it fresh, in concert.

758
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:29,439
Directly at the concert?

759
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:31,916
Of course, Mum. No comparison!

760
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:34,677
I'll be finished in two minutes.

761
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:37,439
Where do we meet after?

762
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:39,556
My place?

763
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:41,990
Your place?

764
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:44,234
Your place is better.

765
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:46,158
My place?
My place.

766
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:50,558
She sees herself
in a pretty white dress, that's why.

767
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:54,238
Sure, but...
that's incidental.

768
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:57,430
Lots of girls
want a first communion.

769
00:48:58,080 --> 00:48:59,514
It's not about that.

770
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:05,273
The move maybe.

771
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:06,390
Maybe.

772
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:09,200
As I see it,

773
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:12,400
I'm hearing about a girl
who's not with us.

774
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:14,799
Who isn't concentrating.

775
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:18,959
You know, when children...

776
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:23,040
when they feel things are
a little... unstable,

777
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:25,917
they need to find reassurance.

778
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:28,878
I was recently separated.

779
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:37,750
But it's fine. Everything's fine...

780
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:41,195
For the child,
I certainly hope so.

781
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:12,550
By the way,

782
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:14,634
I thought it over.

783
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:16,395
I'm OK with it.

784
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:18,474
You're OK with what?

785
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:20,549
What you wanted.

786
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:23,033
How you wanted us to be.

787
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:25,680
To be freer.

788
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:28,795
I'm OK with it.
You're right.

789
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:33,154
Want us to try?

790
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:36,239
To get back together?

791
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:47,195
You don't love me anymore.

792
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:50,916
Don't. I'll always love you.
That's not the point.

793
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:06,589
Sorry, I'm no good.

794
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:08,598
No big deal, we're alive.

795
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:11,360
No, I can't even drive.

796
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:14,154
I can't even...
I'll never drive again.

797
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:17,591
You can drive.
Just check the rear-view mirror.

798
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:20,117
I'll give you a manual, for review.

799
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:22,277
My husband did the driving.

800
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:24,073
He didn't want me to drive.

801
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:26,271
He was right. We nearly died!

802
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:27,914
It's your second lesson.

803
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:31,438
I wanted only to be alone,
to be independent.

804
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:32,880
It was my dream.

805
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:34,714
Now I realise...

806
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:37,513
I need help with everything.

807
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:40,237
I'm handicapped, it's horrible.

808
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:43,758
I have to re-learn everything.

809
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:45,549
It sucks to be alone.

810
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:48,036
No, don't say that.
It's wonderful.

811
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:50,320
The peace of mind.

812
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:54,553
No obligations, no negotiations.
No noise.

813
00:51:57,120 --> 00:51:58,076
Well...

814
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:00,236
Should we go?

815
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:02,511
Ignition, signal, rear-view.

816
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:03,990
Are you sure?

817
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:06,114
We can't stay here.

818
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:07,640
You don't want to drive?

819
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:09,194
I already know how.

820
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:10,436
We almost died!

821
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:14,715
No. I'm not supposed to die today.

822
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:17,236
You're not?

823
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:21,759
When are you supposed to die?

824
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:23,109
March 14th.

825
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:28,156
- This year?
- This year, yes.

826
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:30,675
Really?

827
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:35,273
Just a note of levity.

828
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:37,312
This astrologer, a madwoman...

829
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:39,272
told me that 40 years ago.

830
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:42,152
They never say the date of death.

831
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:45,079
They see it, but they don't tell.
I'm surprised!

832
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:46,520
Well I don't care.

833
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:48,950
Fortune-teller ethics don't matter to me.

834
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:50,753
I really don't care.

835
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:52,075
Ready to go?

836
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:55,750
They have no right.

837
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:57,837
Yeah, I know. But I don't care.

838
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:04,430
Ignition.

839
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:11,510
Signal.

840
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:14,555
Rear-view.

841
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:18,315
No, the rear-view
is to see behind you.

842
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:34,630
What is this mess?

843
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:04,638
- Bravo again!
- Thank you.

844
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:05,750
- Call me?
- Sure.

845
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:08,315
- I was so embarrassed.
- I didn't hear it.

846
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:10,113
Like it?

847
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:12,471
It was remarkable. Quality writing!

848
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:13,920
Look. Behind you.

849
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:16,476
The composer?

850
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:18,870
Maxime Wolff.

851
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,354
I know who you are.

852
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:21,914
Your work is great.

853
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:27,271
I'll leave you to your friends.
But here's my card.

854
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:28,436
This is my card.

855
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:30,275
Call me.

856
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:32,312
I'd like to discuss an idea.

857
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:33,430
All right.

858
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,118
Laura, why are you here?
Are you lost again?

859
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:40,720
No, not this time.

860
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:42,672
Too bad, I can't help you.

861
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:44,390
See you round?

862
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:46,235
- See you?
- Yes.

863
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:49,630
You know Wolff?

864
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:53,199
- Did you know he was coming?
- No, I didn't!

865
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:55,871
- Incredible. What luck.
- You knew?

866
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,070
No, I didn't know!

867
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:58,395
Is he famous?

868
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:03,597
What do we do first?

869
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:06,554
We put our stuff away!
That's right!

870
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:10,437
What is it? Why the long face?

871
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:12,872
Why are you frowning? Simon.

872
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,959
Want to be a squirrel,
if you won't kiss her?

873
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:17,912
She's the one who won't.

874
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:20,079
Really? Why?

875
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:21,998
She doesn't love me anymore.

876
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:28,120
We'll see, no big deal.

877
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:29,720
It is a big deal.

878
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:32,155
No, listen...

879
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:35,194
We'll think it over...

880
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:37,559
we'll work it out.

881
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:41,359
- I don't know...
- Can I be a dog?

882
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:42,990
Sure, yeah...

883
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:45,635
Well, is there a dog in the show?

884
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:48,958
There are lots of animals.
Sure, no problem.

885
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:50,514
Want to be a squirrel?

886
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:52,393
No, I don't play animals.

887
00:56:54,560 --> 00:56:58,395
Well... Sure you don't mind,
half way through the term?

888
00:56:58,520 --> 00:57:00,477
No! Just the opposite.

889
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:03,399
No, I need a flower.
I need a squirrel.

890
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:06,160
My mushroom shows up
only half the time.

891
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:08,110
See you Wednesday?

892
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:10,675
- Yes, thanks.
- My pleasure.

893
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:12,314
Well... goodbye.

894
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:13,430
Goodbye, girls!

895
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:14,550
Time to go!

896
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:09,471
The worst is when even close friends
start to have doubts.

897
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:11,910
Maybe they're not that close.

898
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:14,913
It's understandable.

899
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:17,509
So tempting to join the pack.

900
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:22,479
And he's not even polluting.

901
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:23,750
There you are!

902
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:26,312
One more reason not to worry.

903
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:29,878
Rumours pass.

904
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:32,479
People will tire of it.

905
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:41,797
That's what made you so sad?

906
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:46,674
Yes. Well...

907
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:50,073
Life in general.

908
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:54,792
These days, I don't know...

909
00:58:58,120 --> 00:58:59,520
it's complicated.

910
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:03,874
True, it's complicated.

911
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:10,310
Oh, Maxime! You here?

912
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:14,959
- Hi.
- How are you?

913
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:16,196
Not cold?

914
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:17,959
SEPARATE AND GROW

915
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:22,631
GETTING FAMILIAR WITH DEATH

916
00:59:26,080 --> 00:59:27,673
And with your father?

917
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:30,599
No, with my father it's fine.

918
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:33,039
He's dead anyway, so...

919
00:59:35,080 --> 00:59:36,560
Want to talk about him?

920
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:44,479
How'd your father treat you?

921
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:46,398
No, listen. I said no.

922
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:53,193
My problem is...

923
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:55,680
I don't understand.

924
00:59:56,120 --> 00:59:57,600
I don't recognise myself.

925
00:59:58,080 --> 01:00:00,515
I don't buy that shit.
How can it get to me?

926
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:02,711
That's what I want to know.

927
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:10,030
Is this the first time
you can't control something?

928
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:14,629
Look,

929
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:17,752
I think coming here was a mistake.

930
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:21,516
I need an answer here and now.

931
01:00:21,640 --> 01:00:22,960
I don't want to...

932
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:25,679
spend years just...

933
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:29,429
How much do I owe?

934
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:30,596
Nothing.

935
01:00:38,560 --> 01:00:39,596
Thank you.

936
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:42,593
Very good solo, Julian.

937
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:44,871
From the same place again, please.

938
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:22,476
So I pushed it, I said,
"why not play it at the festival?"

939
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:24,159
He said yes, on the spot!

940
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:26,319
- Horwitz?
- Horwitz!

941
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:29,039
That's amazing!

942
01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:32,955
Horwitz wants to play my piece?

943
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:34,400
Holy shit!

944
01:01:35,560 --> 01:01:37,040
He liked it that much?

945
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:39,399
He might tell you himself.

946
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:41,751
I gave him your number,
he'll call you.

947
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:44,952
Holy shit, this is... amazing.
Amazing!

948
01:01:46,080 --> 01:01:48,072
Wait a second.
I don't understand.

949
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:50,396
The orchestra is full. So he...

950
01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:53,354
He would take the place
of the 1st violin. Got to.

951
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:55,633
Julien's place?

952
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:57,956
If his name is Julien, then yes.

953
01:01:58,080 --> 01:01:59,355
- Really?
- Of course.

954
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:03,439
He's my friend.

955
01:02:03,560 --> 01:02:07,076
Not about your friend.
You want your music to be known?

956
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:10,034
This is an uncanny break.
You don't get that?

957
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:11,435
Sure I do.

958
01:02:11,560 --> 01:02:13,552
It was really special today.

959
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:14,670
Nice of you.

960
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:16,632
It's not nice, it's what I think.

961
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:20,320
Great, Sandro.

962
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:21,760
I'm very happy.

963
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:23,594
- Very happy.
- Right.

964
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:27,510
Sandro!

965
01:02:28,600 --> 01:02:30,239
Starting to shape up!

966
01:02:30,760 --> 01:02:31,830
Did Wolff like it?

967
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:37,351
- You think I'm awful.
- No way.

968
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:40,756
- I'm ashamed.
- Of what?

969
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:42,360
I'm in love with Sandro.

970
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:44,597
I think of someone else,
it's not normal.

971
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:47,758
Normal or not...
What is normal anyway?

972
01:02:49,320 --> 01:02:51,198
Can't imagine how guilty I feel.

973
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:54,950
Yes, I imagine it very well.
I ruined my life with that guilt.

974
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:01,119
He invited me to a party.

975
01:03:01,640 --> 01:03:02,756
Really?

976
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:05,039
But I'm not going to go.

977
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,275
Fuck...

978
01:05:41,720 --> 01:05:43,359
I have to call Sandro.

979
01:05:43,480 --> 01:05:46,154
I don't know how to tell him.
What do I do?

980
01:05:47,080 --> 01:05:49,436
He left me so many messages,
it's terrible.

981
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:52,832
Maybe a text message?

982
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:54,550
Not as harsh.

983
01:05:55,040 --> 01:05:56,918
Well, not as harsh for you.

984
01:05:57,040 --> 01:05:58,633
Eat your apple!

985
01:06:02,520 --> 01:06:04,512
In this light, I see them.

986
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:05,835
Mum!

987
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:08,718
My mother says I have wrinkles.

988
01:06:08,840 --> 01:06:10,433
Not wrinkles, fine lines.

989
01:06:10,560 --> 01:06:12,916
- Wrinkles!
- Fine lines.

990
01:06:13,040 --> 01:06:15,953
Come on, she's fabulous.
She's perfect.

991
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:17,719
Marianne, I know about this.

992
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:20,719
You have to act early.
The sooner the better.

993
01:06:21,800 --> 01:06:24,520
She can't get a facelift at 24,
that's ludicrous!

994
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:25,630
I use creams.

995
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:29,436
It's not a facelift. It's acid
produced by the body, re-injected.

996
01:06:29,560 --> 01:06:32,120
She's 24. She's got time!

997
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:34,471
She doesn't have to act like you.

998
01:06:34,600 --> 01:06:36,592
Like me? Meaning?

999
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:38,630
I don't know...

1000
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:40,875
Like you.

1001
01:06:42,680 --> 01:06:44,637
You have stuff done.

1002
01:06:44,760 --> 01:06:46,877
Why? What stuff do I have done?

1003
01:06:47,840 --> 01:06:50,799
I don't know.
I have no idea what you got done.

1004
01:06:52,320 --> 01:06:54,277
You're 62, Fanfan.

1005
01:06:56,440 --> 01:06:58,750
I didn't mean to hurt her feelings.

1006
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:02,593
- Then why say that?
- I said her age.

1007
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:04,520
I can't pretend to...

1008
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:10,592
You think old age is fun?

1009
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:12,550
What do you mean?

1010
01:07:12,680 --> 01:07:15,070
As an actress, well...

1011
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:19,876
You like your wrinkles, folds,
sagging flesh?

1012
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:21,116
You think it's fun?

1013
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:23,834
No, I don't.

1014
01:07:23,960 --> 01:07:25,394
Neither does she.

1015
01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:27,836
Nobody does.

1016
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:29,235
It was about Laura.

1017
01:07:31,320 --> 01:07:33,118
We have to go now anyway.

1018
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:36,350
Nina, stop.
You'll get all marked up.

1019
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:37,916
Should I drop you?

1020
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:41,036
No, thanks. We'll walk a little.

1021
01:07:41,160 --> 01:07:42,913
You still don't drive?

1022
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:45,319
No, I still don't.

1023
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:51,115
What are you doing?

1024
01:07:51,240 --> 01:07:53,880
The apartment is ready.
I'm starting to pack.

1025
01:07:55,120 --> 01:07:57,351
It's ready? Today is only the 8th.

1026
01:07:57,480 --> 01:07:58,914
Yes, but it's ready.

1027
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:00,996
Morgane?

1028
01:08:02,360 --> 01:08:04,511
Go get me your sister's bag.

1029
01:08:04,640 --> 01:08:05,915
Why doesn't she go?

1030
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:07,713
She never does a thing!

1031
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:11,558
We're leaving tomorrow.

1032
01:08:12,360 --> 01:08:14,272
Tomorrow we'll be gone.

1033
01:08:14,760 --> 01:08:17,195
A relief for you,
and me too actually.

1034
01:08:17,320 --> 01:08:18,674
For everyone.

1035
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:19,950
But...

1036
01:08:22,040 --> 01:08:23,394
All right.

1037
01:08:23,920 --> 01:08:25,718
That contrite pose is great.

1038
01:08:25,840 --> 01:08:27,240
It's not a pose.

1039
01:08:28,040 --> 01:08:29,315
I'm... surprised.

1040
01:08:29,440 --> 01:08:31,238
A pleasant surprise, isn't it?

1041
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:33,957
We'll get past this rough period.

1042
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:36,117
- Rough?
- Oh yes.

1043
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:38,997
You went through hell and I...

1044
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:43,234
Thank you. You did us a favour.
You took us in.

1045
01:08:43,360 --> 01:08:45,716
Three people, invading your space.

1046
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:50,118
It was your idea.
You suggested it.

1047
01:08:51,240 --> 01:08:55,314
I never got why
you were so closed up, so icy.

1048
01:08:56,120 --> 01:08:59,716
I even thought you had
a serious problem, you couldn't share.

1049
01:08:59,840 --> 01:09:00,956
I had one.

1050
01:09:01,080 --> 01:09:02,230
What?

1051
01:09:05,840 --> 01:09:09,959
Nothing, it's silly.
Something... stuck inside my head.

1052
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:15,358
What? You thought I'd force your hand,
form a new family? That it?

1053
01:09:16,120 --> 01:09:18,191
No. You never talk anyway.

1054
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:21,711
You're shut tight like a vault.
No one can talk to you.

1055
01:09:24,520 --> 01:09:26,273
Anyway, we'll be gone tomorrow.

1056
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:49,031
Who is he? Do I know him?

1057
01:09:52,680 --> 01:09:54,160
Oh, I know him!

1058
01:09:54,280 --> 01:09:55,839
I said no.

1059
01:10:09,680 --> 01:10:10,750
Well...

1060
01:10:17,320 --> 01:10:19,391
Rehearsals going well?

1061
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:23,114
Yeah, fine.

1062
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:33,399
I'll come get my things.

1063
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:38,678
I brought them for you.

1064
01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:12,190
You're a funny one.

1065
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:14,232
These things happen.

1066
01:11:14,360 --> 01:11:15,589
Four days out.

1067
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:18,593
Go tell the caterer.

1068
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:22,992
Cancel everything.
Call everyone back. Lovely.

1069
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:25,396
I know, everything I do is bad.

1070
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:28,399
You have time, darling.
To fall in love, to...

1071
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:31,553
There's nothing in the paper.

1072
01:11:31,680 --> 01:11:33,797
Where do they say you did nothing?

1073
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:37,072
Page 10. Now that he's innocent,
no one cares.

1074
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:42,840
I don't get it.

1075
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:47,872
You met the man of your dreams.
Two minutes later, it's over.

1076
01:11:48,680 --> 01:11:49,875
You don't realise.

1077
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:51,150
I do realise!

1078
01:11:51,280 --> 01:11:53,590
I'm not a retard,
whatever you think.

1079
01:11:53,720 --> 01:11:56,679
I won't get married
because you ordered cheese puffs

1080
01:11:56,800 --> 01:11:58,553
and a new pair of breasts!

1081
01:11:59,160 --> 01:12:01,470
Stop being angry at your dad.

1082
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:03,876
I'm not angry.
I don't care.

1083
01:12:04,840 --> 01:12:06,433
He always did his part.

1084
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:09,520
I know, Mum. He's perfect.

1085
01:12:09,640 --> 01:12:11,711
- Always has been.
- Not perfect.

1086
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:12,956
He's been up front.

1087
01:12:13,080 --> 01:12:16,756
He always said he didn't want kids.
Always been there in a pinch.

1088
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:18,439
I know, you told me.

1089
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:20,995
- That's right.
- Right, and all is well.

1090
01:12:23,720 --> 01:12:25,234
Are you getting on?

1091
01:12:39,320 --> 01:12:41,357
I'm not taking anything.

1092
01:12:41,480 --> 01:12:43,153
I'm trying to muddle through.

1093
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:45,675
Is it working?

1094
01:12:45,800 --> 01:12:47,200
Well, no.

1095
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:50,390
I'm stuck.

1096
01:12:50,520 --> 01:12:52,318
Have you tried sophrology?

1097
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:54,872
Yoga. Yoga is very good.

1098
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:56,229
Really?

1099
01:12:57,080 --> 01:12:58,878
You believe in all that?

1100
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,117
I believe in what does you good.

1101
01:13:06,040 --> 01:13:09,112
Eléonore is very happy.
She says thanks... for the kids.

1102
01:13:09,240 --> 01:13:11,960
- No problem. Very cute girls.
- Yeah.

1103
01:13:12,080 --> 01:13:13,070
No?

1104
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:15,351
Sure, they're cute.

1105
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:21,155
Didn't I park a little crooked?

1106
01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:22,714
No, it's fine.

1107
01:13:24,680 --> 01:13:26,592
I can't Tuesday. An audition.

1108
01:13:26,720 --> 01:13:28,632
- Good!
- Well...

1109
01:13:28,760 --> 01:13:29,989
But Saturday is good.

1110
01:13:30,520 --> 01:13:33,513
In the morning.
I might be dead by afternoon.

1111
01:13:33,640 --> 01:13:35,279
Oh shit. The 14th?

1112
01:13:38,120 --> 01:13:40,351
If you'd rather stay home, I get it.

1113
01:13:40,480 --> 01:13:42,597
I'm kidding, no problem.

1114
01:13:43,640 --> 01:13:46,599
I'm obsessed but...
I haven't gone mad.

1115
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:50,760
- Saturday?
- Yes.

1116
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:51,996
Saturday.

1117
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:05,035
Marianne guessed
we'd get together.

1118
01:14:05,160 --> 01:14:06,276
Really?

1119
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:07,390
Right away!

1120
01:14:17,880 --> 01:14:19,439
You believe in destiny?

1121
01:14:19,560 --> 01:14:20,596
What?

1122
01:14:21,640 --> 01:14:22,915
No, nothing.

1123
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:36,759
I didn't hear. What?

1124
01:14:42,680 --> 01:14:44,512
Do you believe in destiny?

1125
01:14:49,560 --> 01:14:51,199
I'm going now.

1126
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:53,312
You staying, or should I drop you?

1127
01:14:56,560 --> 01:14:58,279
I looked at your message.

1128
01:15:00,240 --> 01:15:01,469
By accident.

1129
01:15:02,760 --> 01:15:04,114
My message?

1130
01:15:07,040 --> 01:15:08,440
A text message.

1131
01:15:10,320 --> 01:15:11,515
From Rose.

1132
01:15:13,560 --> 01:15:14,880
By accident.

1133
01:15:16,240 --> 01:15:18,675
You went into my phone by accident?

1134
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:24,752
I read her message, it was...

1135
01:15:25,720 --> 01:15:28,519
"Your kisses all over me.
And now I have to wait!"

1136
01:15:28,640 --> 01:15:30,233
That's her message.

1137
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:33,710
Laura...

1138
01:15:35,880 --> 01:15:39,078
it isn't nice to go through
other people's things.

1139
01:15:40,840 --> 01:15:44,720
Open the wrong door,
don't complain about what you find.

1140
01:15:46,120 --> 01:15:48,351
If anyone can complain, it's me.

1141
01:15:50,280 --> 01:15:53,512
In case you didn't know,
there is such a thing as privacy.

1142
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:58,559
I'm going,
close the door behind you.

1143
01:16:35,360 --> 01:16:39,274
<i>... temperatures
well above normal for the season...</i>

1144
01:16:39,400 --> 01:16:41,551
<i>...a crisis without precedent.</i>

1145
01:16:41,680 --> 01:16:44,559
<i>... this spring,
unemployment spiked,</i>

1146
01:16:44,680 --> 01:16:46,592
<i>especially among rural youth...</i>

1147
01:16:46,720 --> 01:16:48,677
<i>...attributable to human activities,</i>

1148
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:52,191
<i>to deforestation, to greenhouse
gas emission increases.</i>

1149
01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:56,439
<i>Clearly, all this yields
an unrelenting warming of the planet,</i>

1150
01:16:56,560 --> 01:17:00,315
<i>at a rate never before
recorded in human history...</i>

1151
01:17:04,440 --> 01:17:06,671
No desire to see it, or know it.

1152
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:09,998
That's why you shouldn't
have looked, he's right.

1153
01:17:10,120 --> 01:17:11,156
But...

1154
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:13,440
fidelity...

1155
01:17:15,240 --> 01:17:17,630
It's just an idea.
It doesn't hold up.

1156
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:20,874
People sleep with each other.
That's how it is.

1157
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:22,514
Then it's horrible!

1158
01:17:22,640 --> 01:17:24,916
When I'm in love,
I desire no one else.

1159
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:26,872
Or it means I'm not in love.

1160
01:17:28,680 --> 01:17:31,639
You say that
because your lifestyle...

1161
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:33,240
is a little unusual.

1162
01:17:33,680 --> 01:17:34,670
But...

1163
01:17:36,280 --> 01:17:37,760
Unusual?

1164
01:17:37,880 --> 01:17:38,870
Really?

1165
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:42,116
Extremely free.

1166
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:45,240
Extremely free?

1167
01:17:46,440 --> 01:17:47,590
That's him.

1168
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:51,789
He wants to see me.

1169
01:18:34,840 --> 01:18:36,752
The way she looked at him...

1170
01:18:38,160 --> 01:18:42,359
Like she looked at me,
but it wasn't me.

1171
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:44,437
Wolff is a frisky one.

1172
01:18:46,120 --> 01:18:47,349
He's very frisky.

1173
01:18:47,480 --> 01:18:50,632
He wanted to take me home
after rehearsal.

1174
01:18:50,760 --> 01:18:52,160
Really? No!

1175
01:18:52,280 --> 01:18:55,193
Yeah, he did.
He must hit on everybody.

1176
01:18:55,800 --> 01:18:58,759
By the way,
when do you tell Julien he's fired?

1177
01:18:59,680 --> 01:19:01,194
I don't feel right.

1178
01:19:01,320 --> 01:19:03,551
I'm going to... tell him.

1179
01:19:03,680 --> 01:19:04,750
I'll tell him.

1180
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,276
That language you use!
"Anti-social"!

1181
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:14,995
A 9-year-old,
"anti-social, chronic failure"!

1182
01:19:15,120 --> 01:19:16,236
All I said was...

1183
01:19:16,360 --> 01:19:18,920
You have little boxes,
to file people away!

1184
01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:21,555
You always imply
Marianne is a bad mother.

1185
01:19:21,680 --> 01:19:24,798
I think she's an excellent mother!
And I've seen her!

1186
01:19:24,920 --> 01:19:26,400
No reason to get upset.

1187
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:29,354
There is reason!
I am getting upset.

1188
01:19:29,480 --> 01:19:31,472
I think it's incredible...

1189
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:33,910
that you are so... uncharitable.

1190
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:36,359
There. I'm going.

1191
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:38,039
Anyway, that covers it.

1192
01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:46,279
Sorry. She got to me.

1193
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:48,995
No, don't be sorry.
That was great.

1194
01:19:49,120 --> 01:19:51,271
I wish I could answer her like that.

1195
01:19:51,400 --> 01:19:55,110
Plus, Nina's doing better. Right?
Not scratching as much.

1196
01:19:55,240 --> 01:19:58,039
Yes. She hardly scratches anymore.

1197
01:19:58,160 --> 01:20:00,675
- She gave up on communion.
- Really?

1198
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:02,359
She wants to ride a pony.

1199
01:20:03,160 --> 01:20:04,355
No shit?

1200
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:06,120
She's searching.

1201
01:20:09,280 --> 01:20:11,715
You really think I'm a good mother?

1202
01:20:12,440 --> 01:20:13,715
Of course I do.

1203
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,913
Bravo.
That's all for today, thank you.

1204
01:20:20,040 --> 01:20:23,590
I have one note.
The woodwinds, at bar 8...

1205
01:20:23,720 --> 01:20:26,997
a little more character
and it would be perfect.

1206
01:20:27,120 --> 01:20:28,236
I'll speak to them.

1207
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:35,077
What's with Clémence? Is she mad?

1208
01:20:35,200 --> 01:20:36,839
I don't know.

1209
01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:38,670
Get a drink?

1210
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:41,797
I can't, I have an appointment.

1211
01:20:43,480 --> 01:20:44,516
See you tomorrow.

1212
01:20:44,640 --> 01:20:46,120
Yeah, see you tomorrow.

1213
01:20:54,440 --> 01:20:56,238
Fine. I'm very glad.

1214
01:20:57,880 --> 01:21:01,840
Horwitz will be here at noon
tomorrow, for the second go-around.

1215
01:21:01,960 --> 01:21:04,919
We'll re-schedule rehearsals.
He can't do mornings.

1216
01:21:05,800 --> 01:21:08,076
- Fucking drag!
- Excuse me?

1217
01:21:08,200 --> 01:21:09,316
No, I mean...

1218
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:13,191
The Julien thing bothers me.

1219
01:21:13,320 --> 01:21:14,754
Bothers you? How?

1220
01:21:16,640 --> 01:21:19,394
I don't want to replace him.
I don't want to.

1221
01:21:19,520 --> 01:21:20,749
You don't want to?

1222
01:21:21,440 --> 01:21:22,954
Little late for regrets.

1223
01:21:23,080 --> 01:21:26,073
I never liked it.
Julien's been there all along.

1224
01:21:26,200 --> 01:21:28,112
He's a friend. My friend.

1225
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:30,234
Did you say no?

1226
01:21:31,640 --> 01:21:33,074
Did you tell me no?

1227
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:47,230
No, if you don't mind,
I'd rather you don't drive today.

1228
01:21:47,360 --> 01:21:48,840
Oh yeah, right.

1229
01:22:02,200 --> 01:22:04,032
You very rarely signal.

1230
01:22:04,160 --> 01:22:05,230
Really?

1231
01:22:05,960 --> 01:22:07,872
I must have forgotten.

1232
01:22:10,160 --> 01:22:12,755
We could have had coffee
at my house.

1233
01:22:12,880 --> 01:22:14,678
Yeah, that's true.

1234
01:22:19,320 --> 01:22:20,754
How did your audition go?

1235
01:22:20,880 --> 01:22:23,793
I'm in the final three,
they'll call back.

1236
01:22:23,920 --> 01:22:25,036
But...

1237
01:22:26,800 --> 01:22:29,474
The kids' show is coming up.
It's almost ready.

1238
01:22:30,960 --> 01:22:32,155
Will you come see it?

1239
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:37,954
- No?
- Well, no. Because...

1240
01:22:45,680 --> 01:22:48,240
You're not seriously
thinking about it?

1241
01:22:48,360 --> 01:22:49,350
About what?

1242
01:22:49,480 --> 01:22:51,119
The date of... Today.

1243
01:22:51,760 --> 01:22:54,070
That thing... Your date of death.

1244
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:01,513
How many lessons do I need?

1245
01:23:01,640 --> 01:23:03,313
You know how to drive already.

1246
01:23:05,680 --> 01:23:07,160
It's all in your head.

1247
01:23:09,080 --> 01:23:11,117
When you're with me, I'm OK.

1248
01:23:11,240 --> 01:23:13,072
But alone...
Look out!

1249
01:23:21,800 --> 01:23:22,870
Sorry.

1250
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:24,798
- It's OK.
- I never saw it.

1251
01:23:26,600 --> 01:23:27,590
Never saw it.

1252
01:23:33,440 --> 01:23:35,238
What a wonderful wine.

1253
01:23:37,560 --> 01:23:39,711
Won't you order something?

1254
01:23:40,280 --> 01:23:41,475
I'm not hungry.

1255
01:23:42,240 --> 01:23:44,357
You live on love and Saint-Emilion?

1256
01:24:03,240 --> 01:24:05,436
Go ahead,
you can answer if you want.

1257
01:24:05,560 --> 01:24:06,755
Yes, I know.

1258
01:24:13,040 --> 01:24:14,360
Did you see her?

1259
01:24:15,480 --> 01:24:16,755
See who?

1260
01:24:17,400 --> 01:24:18,516
Rose.

1261
01:24:23,240 --> 01:24:24,594
Answer me.

1262
01:24:25,960 --> 01:24:29,237
We covered this.
Must we speak of Rose each time?

1263
01:24:31,760 --> 01:24:35,037
- If you still love her, tell me.
- If I still love her?

1264
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:36,829
You don't?

1265
01:24:37,960 --> 01:24:40,031
Stop, this is ridiculous.

1266
01:24:41,960 --> 01:24:44,634
Why? If we're together,
it's natural for...

1267
01:24:44,760 --> 01:24:46,035
If we're together?

1268
01:24:48,280 --> 01:24:50,476
Laura, we've been out 3 times.

1269
01:24:57,640 --> 01:24:58,835
More.

1270
01:25:00,560 --> 01:25:02,358
Five times, maybe six?

1271
01:25:03,480 --> 01:25:04,834
We're not together.

1272
01:25:07,120 --> 01:25:10,352
I don't want to be with anyone.
I thought that was clear.

1273
01:25:32,120 --> 01:25:34,191
I was an idiot. Believe me, I know.

1274
01:25:35,560 --> 01:25:37,040
I couldn't tell you.

1275
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:43,031
I'm sorry. I feel terrible.

1276
01:25:44,760 --> 01:25:46,399
That's why I saw Horwitz.

1277
01:25:47,640 --> 01:25:49,552
I wondered why he was here.

1278
01:25:50,760 --> 01:25:51,750
Fuck...

1279
01:25:59,480 --> 01:26:00,709
It's great.

1280
01:26:01,840 --> 01:26:04,196
- Yeah, but...
- No, it's great!

1281
01:26:05,040 --> 01:26:06,360
Horwitz!

1282
01:26:06,480 --> 01:26:07,834
You can't say no.

1283
01:26:14,320 --> 01:26:16,960
You know that Wolff
is seeing Laura?

1284
01:26:17,080 --> 01:26:18,355
I heard, yeah.

1285
01:26:21,880 --> 01:26:23,872
Wolff's a charming guy, isn't he?

1286
01:26:27,880 --> 01:26:29,155
I'm cancelling.

1287
01:26:29,280 --> 01:26:31,476
You play or I cancel. He can't...

1288
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:33,512
No! Don't cancel a thing!

1289
01:26:35,480 --> 01:26:38,359
Are you nuts?
It's great. Everyone will come.

1290
01:26:38,480 --> 01:26:41,359
Everyone will hear you.
It's really great.

1291
01:26:43,360 --> 01:26:45,397
We've got years to play together.

1292
01:26:47,160 --> 01:26:50,073
We're friends.
We won't be out of touch.

1293
01:26:54,320 --> 01:26:55,515
We're friends, right?

1294
01:27:25,080 --> 01:27:27,117
Why are you here, Mushroom?

1295
01:27:32,160 --> 01:27:34,914
My wand! It doesn't work!
Did you replace it?

1296
01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:37,239
You brought it for repair?

1297
01:27:37,360 --> 01:27:40,080
It broke right before
the concert. Fantastic!

1298
01:27:40,920 --> 01:27:42,877
What a situation. So...

1299
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:44,036
Clémence?

1300
01:27:45,720 --> 01:27:46,756
Meet you later?

1301
01:27:49,640 --> 01:27:51,154
I left you a message.

1302
01:27:51,280 --> 01:27:53,920
It's done. I told Julien.

1303
01:27:56,080 --> 01:27:57,594
How did he take it?

1304
01:27:58,080 --> 01:27:59,673
He was great.

1305
01:28:01,200 --> 01:28:02,475
It was horrible.

1306
01:28:02,960 --> 01:28:06,237
I said I'd cancel
if he wasn't playing with us.

1307
01:28:06,360 --> 01:28:08,636
- He said no.
- Of course not.

1308
01:28:09,560 --> 01:28:12,519
- What do you mean?
- What could he say?

1309
01:28:12,640 --> 01:28:15,712
You knew he'd say that.
The time to act was before.

1310
01:28:15,840 --> 01:28:18,275
It's easy to play hero now.

1311
01:28:18,400 --> 01:28:20,960
Wow.
No clemency from Clémence.

1312
01:28:21,080 --> 01:28:23,436
What? You want sympathy, as usual?

1313
01:28:23,560 --> 01:28:26,234
Julien gets my sympathy.
It's always about you!

1314
01:28:26,360 --> 01:28:28,477
I'm sick of showing clemency!

1315
01:28:34,120 --> 01:28:35,236
I got to go.

1316
01:28:40,120 --> 01:28:41,839
Laura's waiting for you.

1317
01:28:52,720 --> 01:28:53,836
How are you?

1318
01:28:56,480 --> 01:28:57,834
Looking for Maxime?

1319
01:28:58,440 --> 01:29:00,477
I'm not looking for Maxime.

1320
01:29:01,080 --> 01:29:02,196
Are you well?

1321
01:29:02,320 --> 01:29:04,232
Yeah. Sure.

1322
01:29:04,720 --> 01:29:06,552
- And you?
- Great!

1323
01:29:08,880 --> 01:29:10,712
How are your parents?

1324
01:29:12,400 --> 01:29:14,232
How are your parents?

1325
01:29:15,080 --> 01:29:17,311
Are you busy? This a bad time?

1326
01:29:17,440 --> 01:29:18,715
No, but...

1327
01:29:18,840 --> 01:29:21,435
You got something to do?

1328
01:29:23,960 --> 01:29:25,599
Got something to say?

1329
01:29:26,960 --> 01:29:28,633
Yeah, I can't remember.

1330
01:29:29,360 --> 01:29:30,635
I better go.

1331
01:29:32,280 --> 01:29:33,430
Sure you're OK?

1332
01:29:33,560 --> 01:29:36,871
Oh right!
I just wanted to mention this.

1333
01:29:37,320 --> 01:29:40,154
I can't remember which scientist.

1334
01:29:40,280 --> 01:29:43,830
My dad is clean as a whistle.
He did nothing, it's proven!

1335
01:29:44,760 --> 01:29:46,194
I just mentioned it.

1336
01:29:46,320 --> 01:29:47,834
Where the hell is my car?

1337
01:29:47,960 --> 01:29:50,156
Oh right, I didn't drive.

1338
01:30:12,520 --> 01:30:15,513
Yeah. Jacqueline, it's me.
It's Pierre.

1339
01:30:16,560 --> 01:30:18,631
You must be working.

1340
01:30:20,560 --> 01:30:22,597
Actually, I just called to...

1341
01:30:25,680 --> 01:30:27,672
No, it's stupid. Never mind.

1342
01:30:28,880 --> 01:30:31,270
Anyway, I hope you're doing well.

1343
01:30:32,280 --> 01:30:33,350
Love you.

1344
01:30:35,520 --> 01:30:37,034
Love you, Jacqueline.

1345
01:30:47,720 --> 01:30:48,949
Marianne!

1346
01:30:50,120 --> 01:30:51,600
Too bad you're not home.

1347
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:54,234
Oh shit.

1348
01:30:56,800 --> 01:31:00,589
I wanted to tell you, you're right.
It's great to be free.

1349
01:31:02,240 --> 01:31:03,515
Marianne...

1350
01:31:13,080 --> 01:31:14,309
Want a beer?

1351
01:31:37,920 --> 01:31:39,240
Why are you here?

1352
01:31:41,280 --> 01:31:42,794
I wanted to see you.

1353
01:31:44,160 --> 01:31:45,753
So you know where I live?

1354
01:31:53,920 --> 01:31:55,115
Come on up.

1355
01:32:02,840 --> 01:32:03,990
Right.

1356
01:32:04,920 --> 01:32:06,400
I wanted to tell you,

1357
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:09,111
I thought it over. You can have it.

1358
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:11,229
The money you wanted.

1359
01:32:13,320 --> 01:32:15,232
I don't need it, I worked it out.

1360
01:32:15,360 --> 01:32:16,396
Really?

1361
01:32:17,240 --> 01:32:18,356
Oh shit.

1362
01:32:24,280 --> 01:32:25,919
I'll give it to you anyway.

1363
01:32:27,120 --> 01:32:28,076
I can't use it.

1364
01:32:28,200 --> 01:32:30,795
No, I'm telling you,
I worked it out.

1365
01:32:32,840 --> 01:32:35,116
I thought it over.
It should be yours.

1366
01:32:35,240 --> 01:32:38,233
He loved you.
If he had made a will...

1367
01:32:38,880 --> 01:32:40,234
If he had the time...

1368
01:32:42,600 --> 01:32:43,829
Come on, please.

1369
01:32:47,120 --> 01:32:48,190
Keep it.

1370
01:32:54,400 --> 01:32:57,199
Well, then thank you.

1371
01:33:11,240 --> 01:33:13,038
So Laura, in the end...

1372
01:33:13,920 --> 01:33:16,310
- Didn't work out?
- No, it didn't.

1373
01:33:19,840 --> 01:33:21,320
How's your music?

1374
01:33:22,840 --> 01:33:23,830
Yeah.

1375
01:33:28,120 --> 01:33:30,316
Last time, I was curt because...

1376
01:33:31,040 --> 01:33:33,839
every time you call
you ask for money.

1377
01:33:34,800 --> 01:33:37,360
What else can I ask of you?

1378
01:34:08,560 --> 01:34:11,871
I never saw that picture
of you and my father.

1379
01:34:16,160 --> 01:34:17,833
What's going on?

1380
01:34:17,960 --> 01:34:19,280
Nothing.

1381
01:34:21,680 --> 01:34:24,798
- I don't like outbursts.
- Yeah, I know that.

1382
01:34:34,480 --> 01:34:36,312
Want something to drink?

1383
01:34:37,360 --> 01:34:38,430
Something strong?

1384
01:34:38,560 --> 01:34:40,392
Yeah, I have vodka.

1385
01:34:40,520 --> 01:34:42,079
Vodka would be fine.

1386
01:34:59,600 --> 01:35:01,159
- Not too much.
- Say when.

1387
01:35:09,640 --> 01:35:10,869
Did you have plans?

1388
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:12,116
No, it's fine.

1389
01:35:34,640 --> 01:35:35,960
It's nice.

1390
01:35:43,920 --> 01:35:45,115
Wait up.

1391
01:35:46,840 --> 01:35:48,797
That's Laura, Sandro's girl.

1392
01:35:49,320 --> 01:35:51,357
- You sure?
- Yeah, that's her!

1393
01:35:57,160 --> 01:35:58,389
Yes, all right.

1394
01:35:58,920 --> 01:36:00,479
Thank you, Clémence.

1395
01:36:05,160 --> 01:36:07,629
Laura is on the street in a stupor.

1396
01:36:07,760 --> 01:36:09,831
A friend said she's totally drunk.

1397
01:36:09,960 --> 01:36:11,394
Laura, your...

1398
01:36:13,480 --> 01:36:15,199
What can I do about it?

1399
01:36:15,920 --> 01:36:17,593
We can't leave her like that.

1400
01:36:18,360 --> 01:36:19,589
Where is she?

1401
01:36:19,720 --> 01:36:22,189
I didn't want to worry you, but...

1402
01:36:23,240 --> 01:36:25,880
We're here.
We're at the bus stop.

1403
01:36:26,440 --> 01:36:30,719
Be right there. She left me
this crazy message. I'm coming.

1404
01:36:56,480 --> 01:36:58,233
A little further up.

1405
01:36:59,960 --> 01:37:01,519
- Here.
- Yes.

1406
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:03,150
Careful.

1407
01:37:15,040 --> 01:37:16,872
No-one saw her.

1408
01:38:31,880 --> 01:38:35,430
Maxime, finally.
Sorry about the messages...

1409
01:38:35,560 --> 01:38:36,596
Really?

1410
01:38:37,760 --> 01:38:39,797
Really? Is she...

1411
01:38:40,320 --> 01:38:41,549
How is she?

1412
01:38:44,680 --> 01:38:46,273
We'll be right there.

1413
01:38:47,840 --> 01:38:49,274
She's outside my house.

1414
01:38:50,040 --> 01:38:53,238
He found her on the sidewalk.
Unconscious.

1415
01:38:53,360 --> 01:38:54,589
She doesn't react.

1416
01:38:55,440 --> 01:38:56,715
Thirsty...

1417
01:38:56,840 --> 01:38:58,320
Sitting...

1418
01:38:58,440 --> 01:38:59,840
Zirsting, sting...

1419
01:38:59,960 --> 01:39:01,599
She wants to sit up.

1420
01:39:01,720 --> 01:39:03,677
She says she's thirsty.

1421
01:39:04,320 --> 01:39:07,438
Let her drink, but wake her up.
She took something.

1422
01:39:07,560 --> 01:39:09,199
- Took what?
- Not sure.

1423
01:39:09,320 --> 01:39:11,118
I think she said she took stuff.

1424
01:39:17,040 --> 01:39:18,315
I'm going.

1425
01:39:18,440 --> 01:39:19,999
I'll go with you.

1426
01:39:20,120 --> 01:39:23,352
Sorry, she won't wake up.
I'm calling an ambulance.

1427
01:39:23,480 --> 01:39:25,472
No, don't get all worried.

1428
01:39:26,480 --> 01:39:29,314
I know a way
to wake a sleeping princess.

1429
01:39:35,680 --> 01:39:36,875
See? It works.

1430
01:39:37,760 --> 01:39:40,673
I have to get up early.
Good night.

1431
01:39:40,800 --> 01:39:42,200
Good night, Marianne.

1432
01:40:03,240 --> 01:40:05,391
Everything worked out in the end.

1433
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:07,150
Well...

1434
01:40:08,040 --> 01:40:10,680
I pushed Laura into his arms,
instead of...

1435
01:40:11,800 --> 01:40:12,916
Awful.

1436
01:40:13,880 --> 01:40:15,917
You say he's usually charming?

1437
01:40:18,160 --> 01:40:21,471
When he wants to be,
he is charming. He was...

1438
01:40:22,320 --> 01:40:23,549
super-charming.

1439
01:40:25,920 --> 01:40:27,798
By the way, bravo!

1440
01:40:28,520 --> 01:40:29,636
- Bravo?
- Yes!

1441
01:40:30,240 --> 01:40:32,630
You drove on your own, at night.

1442
01:40:32,760 --> 01:40:35,275
While making calls,
down all those streets!

1443
01:40:35,400 --> 01:40:36,595
Bravo.

1444
01:40:36,720 --> 01:40:37,836
I did?

1445
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:40,229
I did.

1446
01:40:45,280 --> 01:40:46,839
Two-fifteen.

1447
01:40:47,600 --> 01:40:48,670
It's late.

1448
01:40:49,160 --> 01:40:50,514
So it's the 15th.

1449
01:40:53,680 --> 01:40:56,878
- And you're not dead.
- Hey, that's right.

1450
01:41:10,520 --> 01:41:12,113
Guess you're laughing now.

1451
01:41:12,720 --> 01:41:14,359
No, I'm not actually.

1452
01:41:20,680 --> 01:41:22,000
Nice of you.

1453
01:41:22,520 --> 01:41:24,034
You took care of me.

1454
01:41:24,520 --> 01:41:27,160
Clémence saw you
and she called me.

1455
01:41:27,640 --> 01:41:28,676
Clémence.

1456
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:34,280
Are you with her now?

1457
01:41:55,600 --> 01:41:58,160
Not to Daddy.
The show's going to start.

1458
01:41:58,280 --> 01:42:00,272
You can wave from over there.

1459
01:42:10,160 --> 01:42:11,992
Go, Mushroom. Go.

1460
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:14,150
OK, you stay here.

1461
01:42:14,280 --> 01:42:15,839
Go stand behind there.

1462
01:42:23,920 --> 01:42:25,400
What are you doing here?

1463
01:42:25,520 --> 01:42:27,159
I came to see the show.

1464
01:42:27,640 --> 01:42:28,676
The show?

1465
01:42:29,760 --> 01:42:31,479
Watch out, lots of kids in it.

1466
01:42:36,120 --> 01:42:37,793
I wanted to see you, too.

1467
01:42:38,280 --> 01:42:39,634
I want to talk.

1468
01:42:41,840 --> 01:42:43,399
You were right, I...

1469
01:42:44,640 --> 01:42:47,997
I was afraid of, I don't know.
But I realised...

1470
01:42:48,120 --> 01:42:49,554
It's starting.

1471
01:42:57,720 --> 01:43:00,918
Once upon a time,
a beautiful young princess,

1472
01:43:01,040 --> 01:43:02,633
like every princess,

1473
01:43:03,160 --> 01:43:06,756
believed with all her heart
a great love awaited her.

1474
01:43:07,440 --> 01:43:10,274
But... she was lost in a forest

1475
01:43:10,400 --> 01:43:12,517
and couldn't find her way.

1476
01:43:35,200 --> 01:43:36,350
Kiss her.

1477
01:43:38,240 --> 01:43:39,390
Kiss him!

1478
01:43:39,520 --> 01:43:40,510
Kiss him?

1479
01:43:42,160 --> 01:43:44,755
They're supposed to kiss,
but things go awry.

1480
01:43:44,880 --> 01:43:48,271
But the forest is still overjoyed!

1481
01:44:33,960 --> 01:44:36,680
THEY LIVED HAPPILY EVER AFTER

1482
01:44:36,800 --> 01:44:39,918
AND OFTEN STRAYED...

1483
01:46:36,800 --> 01:46:37,995
Bravo!

1484
01:46:38,120 --> 01:46:41,591
Anaïs,
the princess and the prince, come!

1485
01:46:43,760 --> 01:46:47,720
The princess! Anaïs!

1486
01:46:47,840 --> 01:46:50,071
The Prince, Simon.

1487
01:46:51,240 --> 01:46:53,755
Gabriel, the mushroom.

1488
01:46:55,800 --> 01:46:58,360
Mathieu, the rabbit.

1489
01:46:59,480 --> 01:47:02,314
And Selma, the pretty flower.

1490
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:09,435
Lauranie, the squirrel.

1491
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:13,515
The strawberry, Flore.

1492
01:47:15,040 --> 01:47:16,440
Laura, the wolf.

1493
01:47:18,480 --> 01:47:20,472
Lulu, the tree.

1494
01:47:21,880 --> 01:47:24,952
And another flower, Candy.

1495
01:47:26,280 --> 01:47:30,433
And I forgot... the dog, Joanna.

1496
01:47:31,480 --> 01:47:32,630
Bravo, thank you.

1497
01:47:32,760 --> 01:47:34,717
You can go
and say hello to your parents.
