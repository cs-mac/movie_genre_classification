1
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,636
They've killed the boy!
They've killed young Paolo!

2
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,469
They've killed your son Paolo!

3
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,831
Murderers! Murderers!

4
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,673
My son...

5
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,475
All my respect, Don Ciccio.

6
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,439
You killed my husband because
he wouldn't give in to you.

7
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,110
And his oldest son Paolo...

8
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:00,269
...because he swore revenge.

9
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,795
But vito is only nine.
And dumb-witted.

10
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,357
He never speaks.

11
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,915
It's not his words I'm afraid of.

12
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:15,317
He's weak. He couldn't hurt anyone.

13
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,275
But when he grows, he'll grow strong.

14
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:22,150
Don't worry. This little boy
can't do a thing to you.

15
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,751
When he's a man, he'll
come for revenge.

16
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,633
I beg you, Don Ciccio,
spare my only son.

17
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,156
He's all I have left.

18
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:46,309
I swear to God he'll never do
you any harm. Spare him!

19
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,835
Move and I'll kill him!

20
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,871
Run, vito!

21
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,474
Kill him!

22
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:20,675
Any family who hides the boy
vito Andolini will regret it!

23
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,676
You understand?

24
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:37,870
Anybody who hides the boy
vito Andolini is in for trouble!

25
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,359
vito, we're praying for you!

26
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,039
If anyone is hiding the boy
vito Andolini...

27
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,550
...turn him over to us.

28
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,918
Don Ciccio will thank you for it!

29
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,716
It'll be better for the boy,
and better for you!

30
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:40,111
Any family who hides the boy
vito Andolini will regret it!

31
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,236
Nurse.

32
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,952
Money?

33
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,951
Interpreter!

34
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,195
Where are you from?

35
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:52,393
- What is your name?
- Maria.

36
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,956
What is your name?

37
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,998
Come on, son. What is your name?

38
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:08,118
vito Andolini from Corleone.

39
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,348
Corleone. vito Corleone.

40
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,268
Okay, over there.

41
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,111
Next.

42
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,592
Tell him he has smallpox.
Quarantine three months.

43
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,349
vito Corleone!

44
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,310
vito Corleone!

45
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,355
Here he is. This is him.

46
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,636
Did you bring the car keys?

47
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,114
Laurie! Laurie!

48
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,596
Mama!

49
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,392
Mama!

50
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,874
- Look who's here.
- Father Carmelo.

51
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:08,152
- This is Father Carmelo.
- I'm Merle Johnson.

52
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,752
Mama!

53
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:16,599
- Here I am.
- Constanzia, after one week?

54
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,475
I sent the car to the airport last week
to pick you up.

55
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:26,357
It was chaos. Anyway, here I am, just
one week late. This is for my mama!

56
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,597
- What is this?
- You remember Merle?

57
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,360
Hello. How are you? Thank you.

58
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:37,429
Where's Michael? I've got to talk to him
and I can't wait on line.

59
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:40,074
You go see your children first.

60
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:45,638
Then you worry about waiting on line to
see your brother. Like everybody else.

61
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,475
Ladies and gentlemen...

62
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,716
A most distinguished guest
would like to say a few words.

63
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:00,708
Please welcome Senator Pat Geary
of the State of Nevada.

64
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:03,559
And there is Mrs Geary.

65
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,476
Thank you very much.

66
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:22,472
This is a very, very happy day
for me and my wife Mrs Geary.

67
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:25,592
We see Nevada far too seldom.

68
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:30,510
But today we can join with old friends,
we can make new friends,

69
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,315
and we help celebrate
a young man's first Communion.

70
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:41,069
And also to thank that boy's family for
a magnificent contribution to the State.

71
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:47,317
I have here in my hand a cheque
made out to the university,

72
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:52,116
and it is a magnificent endowment
in the name of...

73
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,994
...Anthony vito Corleone.

74
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:00,118
The cheque is signed by
that young man's parents,

75
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,959
whom I think we should recognise.

76
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:07,153
Mike, Pat, Kay - stand up, please.
Let the folks see you!

77
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,396
Folks, I want you to join me

78
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:15,118
in giving a real Nevada thank you
to Mr and Mrs Michael Corleone!

79
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:25,674
We also have, as a special added
attraction, the Sierra Boys Choir,

80
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:31,830
who have chosen a certain special song
and a special arrangement

81
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:35,828
to honour their host,
Mr Michael Corleone.

82
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,473
Boys.

83
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,316
The plaque.

84
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,954
Okay, fellows, did you get that one?

85
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,831
Okay, that's good.

86
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,874
Now, Senator,
just you and Mrs Corleone.

87
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:28,358
My lawyer Tom Hagen. Senator Geary.

88
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,518
He arranged everything
through your man Turnbull.

89
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:34,678
- Yes, yes.
- Sit down.

90
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:41,036
I thought that you and l
would talk alone.

91
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:47,479
I trust these men with my life, Senator.
To ask them to leave would be an insult.

92
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,797
Well, it's perfectly all right with me,

93
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,471
but I am a blunt man and I intend
to speak very frankly to you.

94
00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:00,754
Maybe more frankly than anyone in my
position has ever talked to you before.

95
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,793
The Corleone family
has done well in Nevada.

96
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,790
You own, or control,
two major hotels in vegas,

97
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,232
and one in Reno.
The licences were grandfathered in,

98
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,671
so there was no problem
with the Gaming Commission.

99
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:21,359
Now my sources tell me

100
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:25,155
that you plan to make a move
against the Tropigala.

101
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:30,036
They tell me that, within a week,
you're going to move Klingman out.

102
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:35,712
Quite an expansion. However, it will
leave you with a little technical problem.

103
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:41,119
The licence will still be
in Klingman's name.

104
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:46,797
- Turnbull is a good man.
- Yeah, well, let's cut out the bullshit.

105
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,233
I don't want to spend more time here
than I have to. You can have the licence.

106
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,749
The price is 250,000 dollars.

107
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,713
Plus five per cent of the gross monthly,

108
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:02,198
of all four hotels, Mr Corleone.

109
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:10,310
The price for the licence
is less than 20,000 dollars, right?

110
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,670
That's right.

111
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:18,079
- Why would I pay more than that?
- Because I intend to squeeze you.

112
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,714
I don't like your kind of people.

113
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:25,869
I don't like to see you come out
to this clean country in oily hair,

114
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:28,435
dressed up in those silk suits

115
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,315
and try to pass yourselves off
as decent Americans.

116
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:37,833
I'll do business with you, but the fact is
that I despise your masquerade,

117
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:43,239
the dishonest way you pose yourself
and your whole fucking family.

118
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,192
Senator...

119
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,158
...we're both part of the same hypocrisy.

120
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,996
But never think it applies to my family.

121
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,755
All right, all right.

122
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:09,589
Some people have to play little games.
You play yours.

123
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,673
Let's say that you'll pay me
because it's in your interest.

124
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:20,518
I want your answer and the money
by noon tomorrow. One more thing.

125
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,712
Don't you contact me again, ever.

126
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:27,589
From now on you deal with Turnbull.
Open that door, son.

127
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,915
Senator, you can have my answer now
if you like.

128
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,273
My offer is this:

129
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,913
Nothing.

130
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:45,958
Not even the fee for the gaming licence,
which I would like you to put up.

131
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,309
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

132
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:58,473
Ladies! I didn't know you were out here.

133
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:01,592
- Honey, we have to go.
- Really? I'm sorry.

134
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,951
- It's been delightful.
- It was our pleasure.

135
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,594
It was wonderful talking to you.

136
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:55,194
Fredo! Fredo, you son-of-a-bitch,
you look great!

137
00:19:55,400 --> 00:20:00,349
Frank Pentangeli! I thought you was
never coming out west, you big bum!

138
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,954
I've got to check on my boys.

139
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,913
- What's with the food here?
- What's the matter?

140
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:12,672
A kid gives me a Ritz cracker
with chopped liver and says "canapés".

141
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:17,829
I said, "Can of peas, my ass. That's
a Ritz cracker and chopped liver!"

142
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:23,798
Bring out the peppers and sardines!

143
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,597
Seeing you reminds me of New York
in the old days!

144
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:33,913
You remember Willi Cicci, who was
with old man Clemenza in Brooklyn?

145
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,755
We were all upset about that.
Heart attack, huh?

146
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,872
No, that was no heart attack.

147
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:46,629
That's what I'm here to see
your brother Mike about.

148
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,832
- But what's with him?
- What do you mean?

149
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:55,160
Do I have to get a letter of introduction
to get a sit-down?

150
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:59,672
- You can't get in to see Mike?
- He's got me waiting in a lobby!

151
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:05,832
- Johnny Ola.
- Al Neri.

152
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:16,229
- Do you know my lawyer Tom Hagen?
- I remember Tom from the old days.

153
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,873
Rocco...

154
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:21,959
- What's this?
- It's an orange from Miami.

155
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:26,597
Take care of Johnny's men. They look
like they might be hungry. Johnny?

156
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,959
Tom won't stay. He only handles
specific areas of the business.

157
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,596
Sure, Mike.

158
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,957
- What are you drinking, Johnny?
- Anisette.

159
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:52,869
- If you need anything, I'll be outside.
- Just tell Rocco we're waiting, Tom.

160
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:01,799
- I just left Mr Roth in Miami.
- How is his health?

161
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,434
It's not good.

162
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:07,434
Can I do anything or send anything?

163
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:12,270
He appreciates your concern, Michael,
and your respect.

164
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,879
That casino...

165
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:19,359
Registered owners: Jacob Lawrence,
Allan Barclay. Beverly Hills attorneys.

166
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:24,236
The real owners are the old Lakeville
Road group and our friend in Miami.

167
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:30,353
Klingman runs it and owns a piece of
it too, but I've been instructed to tell you

168
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:34,473
that if you move him out,
our friend in Miami will go along.

169
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:41,397
It's very kind of him.
Tell him it's greatly appreciated.

170
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,075
Hyman Roth always makes money
for his partners.

171
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:51,156
One by one, our old friends are gone.

172
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,557
Death - natural or not,

173
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:57,394
prison, deported...

174
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:03,754
Only Hyman Roth is left, because he
always made money for his partners.

175
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:11,037
I can't believe it! Out of 30 professional
musicians there isn't one ltalian!

176
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:13,800
Let's have a tarantella!

177
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:21,196
You! Up, up, up!

178
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,679
Questa mano!

179
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,711
Questa mano!

180
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,358
What the hell have we here?

181
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:58,873
- I'll see my sister alone.
- It concerns me too. May I stay?

182
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:03,358
How are you, honey? You've met
Merle, he was with me in vegas.

183
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:06,552
- I saw him with you.
- Could I have a drink?

184
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,755
Al, please get him a drink!

185
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,509
We're going to Europe. I'd like to book
passage on the Queen.

186
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:21,274
Why don't you go to a travel agent?

187
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:24,553
We're getting married first.

188
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,232
The ink on your divorce isn't dry yet,
and you're getting married?

189
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,800
You see your children on weekends.

190
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,630
Your oldest boy was picked up in Reno
for a theft you don't even know about.

191
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,912
You fly around the world
with men who use you!

192
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,429
- You're not my father!
- So why come to me?

193
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,993
I need money.

194
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:08,234
Connie, Connie, Connie...

195
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,994
I want to be reasonable with you.

196
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:20,600
Why don't you stay with the family?

197
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:24,553
You can live on the estate
with your kids.

198
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:28,230
You won't be deprived of anything.

199
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:37,399
I don't know this Merle. I don't know
what he does or what he lives on.

200
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,755
Tell him marriage is out of the question
and you don't want to see him anymore.

201
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:46,196
He'll understand, believe me.

202
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,916
Connie.

203
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:01,793
If you don't listen to me,
and marry this man...

204
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:08,235
...you'll disappoint me.

205
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:42,519
- Famiglia!
- Cent' anni!

206
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,110
What's "Chen dannay"?

207
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:48,039
"Cent' anni". It means 1 00 years.

208
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:52,279
It means we should all live happily
for 1 00 years. The family.

209
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:56,234
- It would be true if my father were alive.
- Connie.

210
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,759
Hey...

211
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:01,430
Merle, you've met my sister-in-law
Deanna.

212
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,358
- Fredo's wife.
- My pleasure.

213
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:17,513
With all respect, I didn't
come here to eat dinner!

214
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,638
I know, I know.

215
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:53,475
- I just want to dance!
- You're falling all over the floor.

216
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:57,229
You're just jealous
because he's a real man!

217
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:01,911
- I'm going to belt you right in the teeth.
- You couldn't belt your mama!

218
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,712
These Dagos are crazy
when it comes to their wives.

219
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:10,630
Michael says that if you can't
take care of this, I have to.

220
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:13,513
- I think you'd better.
- Never marry a Wop.

221
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:18,919
They treat their wives like shit!
I didn't mean to say Wop. Don't!

222
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:24,670
What are you doing to me,
you big slob? Help!

223
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,154
Fredo!

224
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:30,956
- I can't control her, Mikey.
- You're my brother, don't apologise.

225
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:38,239
Clemenza promised the Rosato
brothers three territories after he died.

226
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:41,318
- You took over and didn't give it to them.
- I welched.

227
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:45,752
Clemenza promised them lu cazzo.
He promised them nothing.

228
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:50,875
- He hated them more than I do.
- Frankie, they feel cheated.

229
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:56,037
You're sitting up in the Sierra
Mountains and you're drinking...

230
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,470
- What's he drinking?
- Champagne.

231
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:03,470
...Champagne cocktails, and passing
judgement on how I run my family.

232
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:07,475
Your family's still called Corleone.

233
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:11,437
And you'll run it like a Corleone.

234
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:15,394
My family doesn't eat here,
doesn't eat in Las vegas...

235
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,431
...and doesn't eat in Miami...

236
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,995
...with Hyman Roth!

237
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:29,272
You're a good old man, and I like you.

238
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,035
You were loyal to my father for years.

239
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:37,428
The Rosato brothers
are taking hostages.

240
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:44,357
They spit right in my face, all because
they're backed up by that Jew in Miami.

241
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:47,313
I know. That's why I don't want
them touched.

242
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,990
- Not touched?
- No, I want you to be fair with them.

243
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:55,990
You want me to be fair with them?
How can you be fair to animals?

244
00:29:56,200 --> 00:30:01,672
Tom, listen. They recruit spics,
they recruit niggers.

245
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:05,668
They do violence in their grandmothers'
neighbourhoods!

246
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:11,671
And everything with them is whores!
And junk, dope!

247
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:14,519
And they leave the gambling to last.

248
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:19,714
I want to run my family without you on
my back. I want those Rosatos dead!

249
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:22,593
- No.
- Morte.

250
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:32,396
I have business that's important with
Hyman Roth. I don't want it disturbed.

251
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:38,199
Then you give your loyalty to a Jew
before your own blood.

252
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:45,150
You know my father did business
with Hyman Roth. He respected him.

253
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:49,956
Your father did business with Hyman
Roth, he respected Hyman Roth,

254
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:52,720
but he never trusted Hyman Roth

255
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:56,469
or his Sicilian messenger boy
Johnny Ola.

256
00:30:56,680 --> 00:31:02,118
You'll have to excuse me. I'm tired,
and I'm a little drunk!

257
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:08,914
I want everybody here to know, there's
not going to be no trouble from me!

258
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,076
Don Corleone.

259
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:13,430
Cicci, the door...

260
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:23,878
You want him to leave now?

261
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:29,638
Let him go back to New York.
I've already made my plans.

262
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:33,074
The old man had too much wine.

263
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:39,396
It's late.

264
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:52,716
How's the baby?

265
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:56,879
- Sleeping inside me.
- Does it feel like a boy?

266
00:31:57,080 --> 00:32:00,072
Yes, it does, Michael.

267
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,071
Kay?

268
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:08,239
I'm sorry about all the people today.
Bad timing.

269
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:10,635
It couldn't be helped, though.

270
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:14,469
It made me think of what you
once told me.

271
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:19,878
"ln five years the Corleone family
will be completely legitimate."

272
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:22,873
That was seven years ago.

273
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,913
I know. I'm trying, darling.

274
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:32,440
Did you see this?

275
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,476
Why are the drapes open?

276
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,271
Kay, are you all right?

277
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,994
- Are you hit?
- No.

278
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,876
It's all right.

279
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:27,075
Stop! Stop!

280
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:30,356
Halt!

281
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:44,035
They're still on the property.
Please stay inside.

282
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:46,196
- Keep them alive.
- We'll try.

283
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,356
Alive!

284
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,756
Stay by the door.

285
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,031
Yeah, come in.

286
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:18,393
- Mike, are you all right?
- Yeah.

287
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,153
There's a lot I can't tell you, Tom.

288
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:30,111
And I know that's upset you in the past.

289
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:35,199
You felt it was because of
some lack of trust or confidence.

290
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:41,110
But it's because I admire you
and love you,

291
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:43,993
that I kept things secret from you.

292
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:48,273
Now you're the only one I can trust.

293
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,712
Fredo?

294
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:55,388
Well, he's got a good heart.

295
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:59,991
But he's weak and he's stupid,
and this is life and death.

296
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:03,877
Tom, you're my brother.

297
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:14,108
I always wanted to be thought of as
a brother by you, Mikey. A real brother.

298
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:18,636
I know that.

299
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:27,318
You're going to take over.

300
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:29,676
You're going to be the Don.

301
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:37,673
If what I think has happened, has
happened, I'm leaving here tonight.

302
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:44,356
I give you complete power. Over Fredo
and his men. Rocco, Neri, everyone.

303
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:52,513
I'm trusting you with the lives of my wife
and my children, the future of this family.

304
00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:00,471
- If we catch them, will we find out...?
- We won't catch them.

305
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:05,757
Unless I'm very wrong,
they're dead already.

306
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:10,312
They were killed by somebody
close to us.

307
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:14,832
Inside. very, very frightened
that they botched it.

308
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:19,319
You don't think that Rocco and Neri
had something to do with this?

309
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:26,912
See... All our people are businessmen.

310
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:31,398
Their loyalty is based on that.

311
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:36,000
One thing I learned from Pop...

312
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:41,439
...was to try to think
as people around you think.

313
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:45,877
On that basis, anything is possible.

314
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:50,915
Mike, they're dead!
Right outside my window!

315
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:54,078
I want to get out of here.
They're lying there dead!

316
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:07,354
Over here! There's two of them.

317
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:11,999
Looks like they were hired out of
New York. I don't recognise them.

318
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:14,998
Won't get anything out of them now.

319
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,191
Fish them out.

320
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:42,795
Get rid of the bodies.

321
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,798
- Where's Mike?
- Rocco.

322
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:19,634
Anthony, everything is going to be
all right. Try to sleep.

323
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:39,477
- Did you like your party?
- I got lots of presents.

324
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:42,831
I know. Did you like them?

325
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:46,157
Yeah. I didn't know the people
who gave them to me.

326
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:49,353
Well, they were friends.

327
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:55,352
- Did you see my present for you?
- It was on my pillow.

328
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:00,792
I'm going to be leaving
very early tomorrow.

329
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:05,758
- Will you take me?
- No, I can't, Anthony.

330
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:10,556
- Why do you have to go?
- I have to do business.

331
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:14,198
I could help you.

332
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:19,398
I know. Some day you will.

333
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:22,716
Get some sleep.

334
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:39,756
She's really beautiful.
You've got to see her.

335
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:03,231
Wait till you see her.
Words can't describe her.

336
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:16,398
I left Naples. I left Mama.

337
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:19,395
For a no-good tramp!

338
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:25,350
Now here I am in America,
in New York.

339
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:30,708
Alone! Thinking of my mother.

340
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:34,515
Without news from home.

341
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:45,280
Finally, a letter from Naples!

342
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:51,354
vito, how do you like my little angel?
Isn't she beautiful?

343
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:53,835
She's very beautiful.

344
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:59,078
To you, she's beautiful. For me,
there's only my wife and son.

345
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:01,316
Our dear mother -

346
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:05,274
...is dead!

347
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:02,432
We'll go backstage later
and take her to eat.

348
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:08,595
Sit down, you bum!

349
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:17,114
Oh, excuse me, Don Fanucci.

350
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:27,198
We'll go see her backstage.

351
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,510
Who was that?

352
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:33,632
The Black Hand.

353
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:07,159
That's Fanucci...the Black Hand.

354
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:09,874
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

355
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:13,516
Tomorrow! Always tomorrow!

356
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:16,037
You'll pay me today!

357
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:27,637
Let's go.

358
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:32,749
Not my daughter! Let her go!

359
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:36,390
Here, take all my money!

360
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:46,070
vito, come on.

361
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:55,915
I know what you're thinking. But
you don't know how things are.

362
00:46:56,120 --> 00:46:59,749
Fanucci's with the Black Hand.
The whole neighborhood pays him.

363
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:01,791
Even my father, in the grocery store.

364
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,956
If he's ltalian...

365
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:07,549
...why does he bother other ltalians?

366
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:10,399
He knows they have nobody
to protect them.

367
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:12,158
Forget that. Did you like my angel?

368
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:14,794
If you're happy, I'm happy.

369
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:02,594
Don't you feel well?

370
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:09,356
Is your boss treating you all right?

371
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:11,710
Forget it.

372
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:26,313
Hey, you speak ltalian?

373
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:33,559
Hide this for me!

374
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:36,991
Next week I'll come and get it!

375
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:18,551
Abbandando, meet my nephew!

376
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:23,388
How's business?

377
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:31,115
It's good, it's good.

378
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:40,517
Fanucci's mad. Says the
neighborhood's getting sloppy.

379
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:44,395
People don't pay on time,
don't pay the full amount.

380
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:47,558
Says he's been too nice to everyone.

381
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:54,795
So Fanucci's changing?

382
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,639
Sure. He wants double
from everybody.

383
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:00,834
Even from my father.

384
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:05,431
I'm a friend, right? So you'll
let him work here?

385
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:37,799
I've got some bad news.

386
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:45,991
I feel rotten about telling you this...

387
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:51,191
But Fanucci...he's got a nephew...

388
00:50:57,640 --> 00:50:59,676
And you have to give him my job.

389
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:04,476
You've always been good to me,
ever since I came here.

390
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:06,955
You looked after me like a father.

391
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:08,752
I thank you.

392
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:12,554
And I won't forget it.

393
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:26,591
vito!

394
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:32,273
Oh, no!

395
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:36,994
Take this to your family.

396
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:41,111
Thanks anyway. But please,
I can't accept.

397
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:16,389
What a nice pear!

398
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:41,635
I'm Clemenza, you still
have my goods?

399
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:46,233
Did you look inside?

400
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:51,199
I'm not interested in things
that don't concern me.

401
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:05,396
A friend of mine has a nice rug.
Maybe your wife would like it.

402
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:15,479
Sure she would. But who has
money for a rug?

403
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:21,277
It would be a present.
I know how to return a favor.

404
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:30,077
Yeah, sure.

405
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:32,953
My wife would like it.

406
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:58,552
The son of a bitch! He isn't home!

407
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:04,518
Damn, he didn't even leave the key.

408
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:10,669
Well, he won't mind.

409
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:50,108
This is your friend's place?

410
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:54,075
This is a real palace.

411
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:56,032
One of the best.

412
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:04,555
vito, give me a hand, will you?

413
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,117
Look how pretty it is, Santino!

414
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:23,834
Come on in.

415
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:27,679
It's all right. Hyman's in there.

416
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:32,476
- Would you like a tuna sandwich?
- No, thank you.

417
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:42,030
...pick up of two by Holden.
Second and eight for S. C...

418
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:46,510
- Mr Roth?
- Come in, Michael.

419
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:51,437
Sit down, make yourself comfortable.

420
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:55,308
It's almost over.

421
00:59:56,560 --> 01:00:01,111
- Do you follow the football game?
- Not for a while I haven't.

422
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:04,558
I enjoy watching football
in the afternoon.

423
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:09,470
One of the things I love
about this country. Baseball too.

424
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:15,550
Ever since Arnold Rothstein
fixed the World Series in 1 91 9.

425
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:23,474
I heard you had some trouble.

426
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,672
Stupid.

427
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:31,593
People behaving like that with guns.

428
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:36,198
The important thing is you're all right.

429
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:39,358
Good health is the most important thing.

430
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:42,913
More than success, more than money.

431
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:45,998
More than power.

432
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:03,549
I came here because
there's going to be more bloodshed.

433
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:07,548
I wanted you to know,
so another war won't start.

434
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:11,512
Nobody wants another war.

435
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:16,669
Frank Pentangeli asked my permission
to get rid of the Rosato brothers.

436
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:20,919
When I refused he tried to have me
killed. He was stupid, I was lucky.

437
00:00:03,121 --> 00:00:04,952
I'll visit him soon.

438
00:00:05,161 --> 00:00:09,712
The important thing is that nothing
interferes with our plans for the future.

439
00:00:10,801 --> 00:00:13,110
Nothing is more important.

440
00:00:14,961 --> 00:00:19,796
- You're a wise and considerate man.
- And you're a great man, Mr Roth.

441
00:00:20,761 --> 00:00:25,516
- There's much I can learn from you.
- Whatever I can do to help, Michael.

442
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:29,921
- Excuse me. Lunch.
- Come in.

443
00:00:30,201 --> 00:00:34,797
- Thank you, my dear.
- You're going to break your eardrums.

444
00:00:35,841 --> 00:00:38,150
- Enjoy it.
- Thank you.

445
00:00:43,721 --> 00:00:46,360
You're young, I'm old and sick.

446
00:00:47,441 --> 00:00:51,229
What we'll do in the next few months
will make history.

447
00:00:52,361 --> 00:00:54,511
It's never been done before.

448
00:00:55,041 --> 00:00:59,478
Not even your father would dream
that such a thing could be possible.

449
00:01:01,441 --> 00:01:06,151
Frank Pentangeli is a dead man.
You don't object?

450
00:01:07,281 --> 00:01:10,114
He's small potatoes.

451
00:01:19,641 --> 00:01:21,950
What's up?

452
00:01:24,081 --> 00:01:26,311
We got company?

453
00:01:40,921 --> 00:01:43,674
Michael Corleone is here.

454
00:01:46,321 --> 00:01:48,994
He's in your den. You better hurry.

455
00:01:49,201 --> 00:01:52,159
He's been waiting a half hour.

456
00:01:58,201 --> 00:02:00,431
Is something wrong?

457
00:02:04,001 --> 00:02:07,357
I wish you would have let me know
you were coming.

458
00:02:07,561 --> 00:02:11,270
- I could have prepared something.
- I didn't want you to know.

459
00:02:18,481 --> 00:02:22,599
- You heard what happened?
- I almost died. We were so relieved...

460
00:02:22,801 --> 00:02:24,757
In my home!

461
00:02:27,361 --> 00:02:30,910
In my bedroom where my wife sleeps!

462
00:02:32,841 --> 00:02:35,036
Where my children come to play.

463
00:02:36,641 --> 00:02:38,597
In my home.

464
00:02:54,881 --> 00:02:57,839
I want you to help me take my revenge.

465
00:02:58,041 --> 00:03:01,511
Michael, anything. What can I do?

466
00:03:04,281 --> 00:03:07,557
Settle these troubles
with the Rosato brothers.

467
00:03:07,761 --> 00:03:10,116
I don't understand. I don't...

468
00:03:10,321 --> 00:03:14,837
I don't have your brain for big deals.
But this is a street thing.

469
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:19,796
That Hyman Roth in Miami.
He's backing up those sons-of-bitches.

470
00:03:20,001 --> 00:03:24,392
- I know he is.
- So why ask me to lay down to them?

471
00:03:30,121 --> 00:03:33,750
It was Hyman Roth
that tried to have me killed.

472
00:03:35,121 --> 00:03:37,510
I know it was him.

473
00:03:38,121 --> 00:03:40,476
Jesus Christ, Mike.

474
00:03:40,681 --> 00:03:44,799
Jesus Christ, let's get them all.
Now while we've got the muscle.

475
00:03:50,121 --> 00:03:52,840
This used to be my father's old study.

476
00:03:54,001 --> 00:03:56,151
It's changed.

477
00:03:57,161 --> 00:04:01,120
I remember there used to be
a big desk here.

478
00:04:04,201 --> 00:04:09,150
I remember when I was a kid. We had
to be quiet when we played near here.

479
00:04:16,321 --> 00:04:20,280
I was very happy that this house
never went to strangers.

480
00:04:21,241 --> 00:04:24,756
First Clemenza took it over. Now you.

481
00:04:26,801 --> 00:04:30,999
My father taught me many things here.
He taught me in this room.

482
00:04:33,001 --> 00:04:36,835
He taught me, "Keep your friends close,
but your enemies closer."

483
00:04:40,881 --> 00:04:46,877
If Hyman Roth sees that I interceded
in this, in the Rosato brothers' favour,

484
00:04:47,081 --> 00:04:50,357
he'll think his relationship with me
is still good.

485
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:55,435
That's what I want him to think.

486
00:04:56,081 --> 00:04:59,790
I want him relaxed and confident
in our friendship.

487
00:05:00,681 --> 00:05:04,515
Then I'll be able to find out
who the traitor in my family was.

488
00:05:30,921 --> 00:05:34,197
- Yeah?
- Fredo, this is Johnny Ola.

489
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:38,596
- We need some more help.
- Johnny?

490
00:05:39,441 --> 00:05:42,319
Jesus Christ, what the hell time is it?

491
00:05:42,521 --> 00:05:45,194
- Who's that, honey?
- Listen good, Fredo.

492
00:05:45,401 --> 00:05:48,393
Why are you calling me?
I don't want to talk to you.

493
00:05:48,601 --> 00:05:51,798
Pentangeli is going to accept
the Rosato brothers' deal.

494
00:05:52,001 --> 00:05:53,957
- Oh, God.
- Will he come alone?

495
00:05:54,161 --> 00:05:57,119
I don't know. You've got me in
deep enough already.

496
00:05:57,321 --> 00:06:02,270
Everything will be all right. Pentangeli
says he's willing to make a deal.

497
00:06:02,481 --> 00:06:06,679
All we want to know is if he's on
the level, or if he'll bring his boys.

498
00:06:06,881 --> 00:06:09,839
You lied to me. I don't want you
to call me anymore.

499
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:14,990
- Your brother won't find out we talked.
- I don't know what you're talking about.

500
00:06:24,481 --> 00:06:28,156
- Who was that?
- Wrong number.

501
00:06:35,121 --> 00:06:39,353
- Frankie, I've got nobody here.
- Wait in the car, Cicc'.

502
00:06:39,561 --> 00:06:42,121
- Frankie.
- That's okay, Cicc'.

503
00:06:48,401 --> 00:06:52,440
- What's this?
- A lucky C note for our new deal.

504
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:57,714
Ritchie. Give us a taste.

505
00:07:01,801 --> 00:07:05,111
We were all real happy
about your decision, Frankie.

506
00:07:05,681 --> 00:07:09,754
- You won't regret it.
- I don't like the C note, Rosato.

507
00:07:09,961 --> 00:07:12,555
I take that as an insult.

508
00:07:12,761 --> 00:07:15,639
Michael Corleone says hello!

509
00:07:32,081 --> 00:07:33,639
Close the door!

510
00:07:34,281 --> 00:07:35,953
Your friend the cop...

511
00:07:36,761 --> 00:07:40,470
Hey, Ritch. It's dark in here.
Are you open or closed?

512
00:07:40,681 --> 00:07:44,310
I just came in to clean up a little,
you know?

513
00:07:46,681 --> 00:07:49,070
What's the matter?

514
00:07:49,281 --> 00:07:53,240
- Is that something on the floor?
- Carmine, not here! Anthony!

515
00:07:56,281 --> 00:07:59,796
You open this bar
and I'll blow your head in!

516
00:08:43,841 --> 00:08:46,116
Freddy, it's good to see you.

517
00:08:48,481 --> 00:08:53,032
- How is he?
- He's okay. He's in the back.

518
00:08:56,921 --> 00:08:59,230
Girls, take a hike.

519
00:09:02,281 --> 00:09:04,397
In this room here.

520
00:09:06,881 --> 00:09:10,351
- I want to talk to him alone first.
- Come on.

521
00:09:18,601 --> 00:09:21,832
I thought I could help you, Senator.

522
00:09:25,121 --> 00:09:26,839
Hagen?

523
00:09:28,081 --> 00:09:32,074
- Listen, I did not...
- It's all right.

524
00:09:32,281 --> 00:09:36,797
- I didn't do anything.
- It's okay. You're very lucky.

525
00:09:37,601 --> 00:09:42,038
My brother Fredo operates this place.
He was called before anyone.

526
00:09:42,841 --> 00:09:46,800
Had this happened some place else,
we couldn't have helped you.

527
00:09:49,561 --> 00:09:52,792
When I woke up, I was on the floor.

528
00:09:53,881 --> 00:09:58,113
- And I don't know how it happened.
- You can't remember?

529
00:10:01,241 --> 00:10:03,277
I passed out.

530
00:10:18,761 --> 00:10:21,719
Just a game. Jesus.

531
00:10:31,761 --> 00:10:33,991
Jesus, Jesus!

532
00:10:38,281 --> 00:10:40,636
Jesus God!

533
00:10:40,961 --> 00:10:42,758
God!

534
00:10:44,881 --> 00:10:48,556
I don't know, and I don't understand
why I can't remember.

535
00:10:48,761 --> 00:10:51,434
Doesn't matter, just do as I say.

536
00:10:51,641 --> 00:10:57,238
Put in a call to your office.
Explain that you'll be there tomorrow.

537
00:10:57,881 --> 00:11:02,671
You decided to spend the night at
Michael Corleone's house in Tahoe.

538
00:11:02,881 --> 00:11:07,193
- As his guest.
- I do remember that she was laughing.

539
00:11:09,121 --> 00:11:14,354
We'd done it before, and I know
that I could not have hurt that girl.

540
00:11:15,321 --> 00:11:19,280
This girl has no family.
Nobody knows that she worked here.

541
00:11:19,481 --> 00:11:22,917
It'll be as though she never existed.

542
00:11:24,321 --> 00:11:27,119
All that's left is our friendship.

543
00:11:41,481 --> 00:11:45,190
- Yes?
- Sorry, but we're not to let you through.

544
00:11:45,801 --> 00:11:49,760
- I'm just going to the market.
- We'll pick up anything you want.

545
00:11:49,961 --> 00:11:53,078
- Whose orders are these?
- Mr Hagen's. He's coming.

546
00:11:53,281 --> 00:11:55,272
I'll speak to him.

547
00:12:01,201 --> 00:12:04,591
I wanted to explain,
but I had business in Carson City.

548
00:12:04,801 --> 00:12:08,760
It's Michael's request for your safety.
We'll get anything you need.

549
00:12:08,961 --> 00:12:13,796
- So I'm supposed to stay in my house?
- No, within the compound will be fine.

550
00:12:14,001 --> 00:12:17,038
- We were going to New England.
- That's off.

551
00:12:17,481 --> 00:12:20,712
- Am I a prisoner?
- That's not how we see it, Kay.

552
00:12:20,921 --> 00:12:23,993
Come on, kids.
We're going back to the house.

553
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:27,838
Joe.

554
00:13:11,761 --> 00:13:13,433
Cuba, Cuba!

555
00:13:52,801 --> 00:13:55,440
Most respected gentlemen.

556
00:13:55,801 --> 00:13:57,871
Welcome to Havana.

557
00:13:59,921 --> 00:14:04,870
I want to thank this distinguished group
of American industrialists...

558
00:14:06,601 --> 00:14:09,399
...for continuing to work with Cuba...

559
00:14:10,081 --> 00:14:13,039
...for the greatest period of prosperity...

560
00:14:13,961 --> 00:14:16,634
...in her entire history.

561
00:14:17,041 --> 00:14:19,191
Mr William Shaw...

562
00:14:19,401 --> 00:14:22,757
...representing
the General Fruit Company.

563
00:14:22,961 --> 00:14:25,350
Messrs Corngold and Dant...

564
00:14:25,561 --> 00:14:29,349
...of United Telephone
and Telegraph Company.

565
00:14:29,561 --> 00:14:30,960
Mr Petty...

566
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:36,474
...regional vice President of
the Pan American Mining Corporation.

567
00:14:36,681 --> 00:14:40,879
Mr Robert Allen
of South American Sugar.

568
00:14:41,081 --> 00:14:44,915
Mr Michael Corleone of Nevada...

569
00:14:45,121 --> 00:14:49,433
...representing our associates
in tourism and leisure activities.

570
00:14:49,641 --> 00:14:54,192
And my old friend and associate
from Florida...

571
00:14:54,401 --> 00:14:56,471
...Mr Hyman Roth.

572
00:14:56,681 --> 00:15:01,630
I would like to thank United Telephone
and Telegraph for their Christmas gift.

573
00:15:06,281 --> 00:15:09,239
A solid gold telephone.

574
00:15:10,881 --> 00:15:14,191
Perhaps you gentlemen
would like to look at it.

575
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:16,793
- Mr President?
- Yes?

576
00:15:17,001 --> 00:15:22,519
Could you discuss the rebel activity and
what this can mean to our businesses?

577
00:15:22,721 --> 00:15:23,995
- Of course.
- Heavy stuff.

578
00:15:24,201 --> 00:15:29,594
I assure you that, although the rebels
have started a campaign in Las villas...

579
00:15:35,881 --> 00:15:41,160
...my staff indicates, with assurance,
that we'll drive them out of Santa Clara

580
00:15:41,361 --> 00:15:43,591
before the New Year.

581
00:15:45,561 --> 00:15:47,711
I want to put you all at ease.

582
00:15:47,921 --> 00:15:52,870
We will tolerate no guerrillas
in the casinos or the swimming pools.

583
00:16:09,801 --> 00:16:14,716
He said that they're making an arrest,
and in a few minutes he'll let us through.

584
00:16:14,921 --> 00:16:15,876
Johnny...

585
00:16:16,081 --> 00:16:17,036
It's nothing.

586
00:16:17,241 --> 00:16:21,200
Just some lousy bandits.
The police are cleaning them up.

587
00:16:22,721 --> 00:16:23,995
Viva Fidel!

588
00:16:39,161 --> 00:16:43,871
I hope my age is correct.
I'm always accurate about my age.

589
00:16:45,001 --> 00:16:48,755
Make sure that everybody
sees the cake before we cut it.

590
00:16:51,441 --> 00:16:54,001
I'm very pleased...

591
00:16:54,201 --> 00:16:59,070
...you're all able to come from
such distances to be with me today.

592
00:17:00,041 --> 00:17:03,397
When a man comes to this point
in his life...

593
00:17:04,081 --> 00:17:07,039
...he wants to turn over
the things he's been blessed with.

594
00:17:07,521 --> 00:17:11,878
Turn them over to friends,
as a reward for the friends he's had...

595
00:17:13,641 --> 00:17:18,590
...and to make sure that everything
goes well after he's gone.

596
00:17:18,801 --> 00:17:21,395
- Not for years.
- Hear, hear!

597
00:17:21,601 --> 00:17:26,550
We'll see. The doctors would disagree,
but what do they know?

598
00:17:26,801 --> 00:17:31,238
These are wonderful things
that we've achieved in Havana,

599
00:17:31,441 --> 00:17:34,353
and there's no limit
to where we can go from here.

600
00:17:34,561 --> 00:17:39,077
This kind of government knows how to
help business, to encourage it.

601
00:17:39,281 --> 00:17:45,800
The hotels here are bigger and swankier
than any of the joints in vegas.

602
00:17:46,081 --> 00:17:48,470
We can thank our friends
in the Cuban government,

603
00:17:48,681 --> 00:17:53,709
which has put up half the cash with the
Teamsters, on a dollar for dollar basis,

604
00:17:53,921 --> 00:17:56,151
and has relaxed restrictions on imports.

605
00:17:56,361 --> 00:18:00,752
What I'm saying is that we have now
what we have always needed:

606
00:18:00,961 --> 00:18:03,634
Real partnership with a government.

607
00:18:03,841 --> 00:18:05,399
Smaller piece.

608
00:18:06,161 --> 00:18:10,951
You all know Michael Corleone
and we all remember his father.

609
00:18:11,161 --> 00:18:14,597
At the time of my retirement, or death,

610
00:18:14,801 --> 00:18:20,273
I turn over all my interests
in the Havana operation to his control.

611
00:18:20,481 --> 00:18:23,871
But, all of you will share.

612
00:18:24,081 --> 00:18:27,915
The Nacionale will go
to the Lakeville Road Boys,

613
00:18:28,121 --> 00:18:31,079
the Capri to the Corleone family,

614
00:18:31,281 --> 00:18:33,636
the Sevilla Biltmore also,

615
00:18:33,841 --> 00:18:39,359
but Eddie Levine will bring in the Pennino
brothers, Dino and Eddie, for a piece

616
00:18:39,561 --> 00:18:42,075
and to handle the casino operations.

617
00:18:42,281 --> 00:18:45,398
We've saved a piece
for some friends in Nevada

618
00:18:45,601 --> 00:18:49,150
to make sure that things go smoothly
back home.

619
00:18:51,201 --> 00:18:55,956
I want all of you to enjoy your cake.
So, enjoy!

620
00:18:56,161 --> 00:18:58,470
- Happy birthday!
- L'chaim!

621
00:18:59,561 --> 00:19:02,519
I saw an interesting thing happen today.

622
00:19:03,321 --> 00:19:06,518
A rebel was being arrested
by the military police.

623
00:19:06,721 --> 00:19:10,953
Rather than be taken alive, he exploded
a grenade he had in his jacket.

624
00:19:11,161 --> 00:19:14,790
He killed himself and took a captain
of the command with him.

625
00:19:15,001 --> 00:19:18,596
- Those rebels are lunatics.
- Maybe so.

626
00:19:19,761 --> 00:19:24,437
But it occurred to me, that the soldiers
are paid to fight, the rebels aren't.

627
00:19:24,641 --> 00:19:28,190
- What does that tell you?
- They can win.

628
00:19:30,481 --> 00:19:33,917
This country has had rebels
for 50 years. It's in their blood.

629
00:19:34,121 --> 00:19:37,636
I know, I've been coming here
since the Twenties.

630
00:19:37,841 --> 00:19:41,390
We were running molasses
from Havana when you were a baby.

631
00:19:41,601 --> 00:19:44,877
The trucks were owned by your father.

632
00:19:45,081 --> 00:19:46,594
Michael...

633
00:19:53,481 --> 00:19:57,440
I'd rather we talked about this
when we're alone.

634
00:19:58,961 --> 00:20:01,919
The two million never got to the island.

635
00:20:07,361 --> 00:20:10,319
It mustn't be known
that you held back the money,

636
00:20:10,521 --> 00:20:12,876
because you worried about the rebels.

637
00:20:19,401 --> 00:20:22,518
Sit down, Michael. Sit down.

638
00:20:29,881 --> 00:20:33,556
If I could only live to see it,
to be there with you.

639
00:20:35,961 --> 00:20:39,954
What I wouldn't give for 20 more years.

640
00:20:41,681 --> 00:20:46,152
Here we are, protected. Free to make
our profits without Kefauver,

641
00:20:46,361 --> 00:20:49,910
the goddamn Justice Department
and the FBl.

642
00:20:50,121 --> 00:20:53,477
90 miles away, in partnership
with a friendly government.

643
00:20:54,681 --> 00:20:57,991
90 miles. It's nothing.

644
00:20:58,921 --> 00:21:04,518
Just one small step for a man looking
to be President of the United States

645
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:07,838
and having the cash
to make it possible.

646
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:09,474
Michael...

647
00:21:11,161 --> 00:21:12,879
...we're bigger than U.S. Steel.

648
00:21:39,121 --> 00:21:41,954
Mikey, how are you? Okay?

649
00:21:43,361 --> 00:21:47,798
- Hi! Freddie Corleone.
- Mio frati.

650
00:21:48,921 --> 00:21:51,276
Jesus Christ, what a trip!

651
00:21:51,481 --> 00:21:54,837
I thought, "What if somebody knows
what I've got in here".

652
00:21:55,041 --> 00:21:59,319
Can you imagine that? Two million
dollars on the seat next to me.

653
00:22:02,881 --> 00:22:05,634
- Excuse me.
- It's okay.

654
00:22:07,001 --> 00:22:09,561
You want to count it?

655
00:22:13,081 --> 00:22:16,437
What's going on? I'm totally in the dark.

656
00:22:16,641 --> 00:22:21,920
The family is making an investment in
Havana. This is a gift for the President.

657
00:22:22,121 --> 00:22:25,477
That's great! Havana's great.

658
00:22:26,921 --> 00:22:29,310
It's my kind of town.

659
00:22:30,161 --> 00:22:35,110
- Anybody I know in Havana?
- Don't know. Hyman Roth, Johnny Ola?

660
00:22:37,561 --> 00:22:40,075
No. I've never met them.

661
00:22:43,561 --> 00:22:47,395
Listen, Mikey, I'm kind of...

662
00:22:51,121 --> 00:22:55,319
...kind of nervous from the trip.
Can I get a drink or something?

663
00:22:56,081 --> 00:22:59,039
I thought maybe we'd go out together.

664
00:22:59,401 --> 00:23:03,280
I know a place where we
can spend some time together.

665
00:23:04,521 --> 00:23:09,879
Sometimes I think I should have
married a woman like you did. Like Kay.

666
00:23:10,081 --> 00:23:13,437
Have kids. Have a family.

667
00:23:14,881 --> 00:23:18,590
For once in my life, be more like...

668
00:23:19,641 --> 00:23:21,199
...Pop.

669
00:23:23,321 --> 00:23:27,678
It's not easy to be a son, Fredo.
It's not easy.

670
00:23:27,881 --> 00:23:30,918
Mama used to say,
"You don't belong to me."

671
00:23:31,121 --> 00:23:34,397
"You were left on the doorstep
by gypsies."

672
00:23:34,601 --> 00:23:37,240
Sometimes I think it's true.

673
00:23:37,441 --> 00:23:39,875
You're no gypsy, Fredo.

674
00:23:40,721 --> 00:23:44,350
Mikey... I was mad at you.

675
00:23:51,801 --> 00:23:55,157
Why didn't we spend time
like this before?

676
00:23:55,361 --> 00:23:57,795
- You want a drink, right?
- Waiter!

677
00:24:01,841 --> 00:24:03,832
Por favor...

678
00:24:05,161 --> 00:24:07,914
- How do you say Banana Daquiri?
- Banana Daquiri.

679
00:24:08,121 --> 00:24:10,351
- That's it?
- That's it.

680
00:24:10,561 --> 00:24:13,200
Uno Banana Daquiri...

681
00:24:13,401 --> 00:24:15,631
...and a club soda.

682
00:24:23,041 --> 00:24:28,161
Senator Geary flies in from Washington
tomorrow with some government people.

683
00:24:28,361 --> 00:24:31,831
I want you to show them
a good time in Havana.

684
00:24:33,561 --> 00:24:37,440
- That's my speciality, right?
- Can I trust you with something?

685
00:24:38,201 --> 00:24:40,476
Of course, Mike.

686
00:24:42,601 --> 00:24:47,959
Later in the evening we're all invited to
the President to bring in the New Year.

687
00:24:48,481 --> 00:24:53,839
After it's over they'll take me home
in a military car - alone.

688
00:24:54,041 --> 00:24:56,475
For my protection.

689
00:24:56,681 --> 00:25:00,754
Before I reach my hotel,
I'll be assassinated.

690
00:25:17,441 --> 00:25:20,433
- Who?
- Roth.

691
00:25:25,841 --> 00:25:29,117
It was Roth who tried to kill me
in my home.

692
00:25:30,401 --> 00:25:32,517
It was Roth all along.

693
00:25:32,721 --> 00:25:36,509
He acts like I'm his son, his successor.

694
00:25:37,561 --> 00:25:40,553
But he thinks he'll live forever
and wants me out.

695
00:25:45,281 --> 00:25:49,593
- How can I help?
- Just go along, as if you know nothing.

696
00:25:49,801 --> 00:25:53,555
- I've already made my move.
- What move?

697
00:25:53,761 --> 00:25:56,195
Hyman Roth won't see the New Year.

698
00:26:12,721 --> 00:26:16,350
You're to take it easy,
he'll be back tomorrow.

699
00:26:16,561 --> 00:26:21,237
Fly in my own doctor from Miami. I don't
trust a doctor who can't speak English.

700
00:26:22,721 --> 00:26:25,713
- Gracias, señor.
- Buenas noches.

701
00:26:27,241 --> 00:26:30,756
- Honey, go to the casino.
- If you're feeling better.

702
00:26:30,961 --> 00:26:32,997
Feel fine.

703
00:26:34,281 --> 00:26:38,797
- Play the bingo game.
- Okay. Nice to see you, Mr Paul.

704
00:26:40,681 --> 00:26:45,436
My sixth sense tells me Fredo brought
a bag full of money. Where is it?

705
00:26:47,841 --> 00:26:54,155
- You're pulling out?
- Just want to... Just want to wait.

706
00:26:57,641 --> 00:27:00,951
- How do you feel?
- Terrible.

707
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:04,597
I'd give four million to be able to take
a painless piss.

708
00:27:05,201 --> 00:27:10,673
- Who had Frank Pentangeli killed?
- The Rosato brothers.

709
00:27:10,881 --> 00:27:14,396
I know, but who gave the go-ahead?

710
00:27:14,601 --> 00:27:16,080
I know I didn't.

711
00:27:24,001 --> 00:27:28,791
There was this kid I grew up with.
He was younger than me.

712
00:27:29,001 --> 00:27:34,837
Sort of looked up to me, you know.
We did our first work together.

713
00:27:35,321 --> 00:27:38,916
Worked our way out of the street.
Things were good.

714
00:27:40,161 --> 00:27:44,518
During Prohibition
we ran molasses into Canada.

715
00:27:44,721 --> 00:27:47,679
Made a fortune. Your father too.

716
00:27:49,201 --> 00:27:54,958
As much as anyone,
I loved him and trusted him.

717
00:27:57,641 --> 00:28:03,193
Later on he had an idea to build a city

718
00:28:03,401 --> 00:28:06,996
out of a desert stop-over
for G. I.s going to the West Coast.

719
00:28:08,841 --> 00:28:12,390
That kid's name was Moe Greene

720
00:28:12,601 --> 00:28:16,071
and the city he invented was Las vegas.

721
00:28:17,201 --> 00:28:19,590
This was a great man.

722
00:28:19,801 --> 00:28:22,156
A man of vision and guts.

723
00:28:22,361 --> 00:28:28,311
And there isn't even a plaque, signpost
or statue of him in that town.

724
00:28:30,161 --> 00:28:33,597
Someone put a bullet through his eye.

725
00:28:34,801 --> 00:28:36,996
No one knows who gave the order.

726
00:28:38,001 --> 00:28:41,038
When I heard it, I wasn't angry.

727
00:28:41,241 --> 00:28:46,873
I knew Moe, I knew he was headstrong.
Talking loud, saying stupid things.

728
00:28:47,081 --> 00:28:51,632
So when he turned up dead, I let it go.

729
00:28:53,321 --> 00:28:56,279
And I said to myself,

730
00:28:56,481 --> 00:29:00,190
"This is the business we've chosen."

731
00:29:00,401 --> 00:29:02,517
I didn't ask...

732
00:29:03,081 --> 00:29:08,030
...who gave the order, because it had
nothing to do with business.

733
00:29:16,241 --> 00:29:20,519
That two million in a bag in your room...

734
00:29:22,721 --> 00:29:26,191
I'm going in to take a nap.

735
00:29:26,641 --> 00:29:32,318
When I wake, if the money
is on the table, I know I have a partner.

736
00:29:32,521 --> 00:29:35,479
If it isn't, I know I don't.

737
00:30:28,241 --> 00:30:32,234
Does everybody know everybody?
You know Senator Geary.

738
00:30:32,441 --> 00:30:35,513
Good to see you, Mike.
I'm glad we spend this time together.

739
00:30:35,721 --> 00:30:38,474
Senator Payton from Florida...

740
00:30:38,681 --> 00:30:41,673
...Judge DeMalco from New York...

741
00:30:41,881 --> 00:30:44,554
...Senator Ream from Maryland...

742
00:30:44,761 --> 00:30:47,116
...Fred Corngold from UTT.

743
00:30:47,321 --> 00:30:50,950
- That Fred does a mean cha-cha-cha!
- He does?

744
00:30:51,161 --> 00:30:53,356
Gentlemen, it's refill time!

745
00:30:53,561 --> 00:30:57,839
You might try some of the local drinks.
Cuba Libre, Piña Colada...

746
00:30:58,041 --> 00:31:01,750
I think I'll try
one of those redheaded Yolandas...

747
00:31:01,961 --> 00:31:04,634
- That you got! Con gusto...
- Johnny!

748
00:31:05,401 --> 00:31:08,837
You don't know my brother Fredo.
Johnny Ola, Fredo.

749
00:31:09,041 --> 00:31:12,431
- We never met. Johnny Ola.
- Pleasure.

750
00:31:13,681 --> 00:31:15,990
Gentlemen, to a night in Havana!

751
00:31:16,201 --> 00:31:17,680
- Happy New Year!
- Happy New Year!

752
00:31:17,881 --> 00:31:20,679
- Feliz Año Nuevo!
- Happy New Year.

753
00:31:31,921 --> 00:31:35,834
- Hey, Freddie, why are we standing?
- Everybody stands.

754
00:31:36,041 --> 00:31:40,353
- It's worth it. You won't believe this.
- I don't believe it already.

755
00:31:40,561 --> 00:31:43,519
- 50 dollars, right?
- You've got a bet, mister.

756
00:31:51,361 --> 00:31:52,760
That's Superman.

757
00:32:25,441 --> 00:32:27,557
Did I tell you or did I tell you?

758
00:32:29,241 --> 00:32:31,675
- I don't believe it!
- It's got to be fake.

759
00:32:31,881 --> 00:32:35,032
It's real. That's why he's called
Superman.

760
00:32:35,561 --> 00:32:39,315
Hey, Freddy, where did you find
this place?

761
00:32:39,521 --> 00:32:43,639
Johnny Ola brought me here.
I didn't believe it, but seeing is believing!

762
00:32:43,841 --> 00:32:47,197
- I see it, but still don't believe it!
- 50 bucks, Pat.

763
00:32:47,401 --> 00:32:50,837
Roth won't go here,
but Johnny knows these places!

764
00:32:51,561 --> 00:32:56,271
- Watch, he'll break a cracker with it.
- I want to see him break a brick!

765
00:34:14,921 --> 00:34:18,152
Relax, we're taking you to the hospital.

766
00:35:05,281 --> 00:35:07,590
...and you'll continue to get those.

767
00:35:07,801 --> 00:35:11,874
I don't believe that President Eisenhower
would ever pull out of Cuba,

768
00:35:12,081 --> 00:35:15,596
as we have over one billion dollars
invested in this country.

769
00:35:18,801 --> 00:35:22,237
The American public
believe in non-intervention...

770
00:35:22,441 --> 00:35:24,909
Fredo! Where are you going?

771
00:35:25,121 --> 00:35:28,591
I'm getting a real drink,
because I can't...

772
00:36:21,921 --> 00:36:25,197
What kept Mr Roth?
I understood he was coming.

773
00:36:25,401 --> 00:36:28,757
Reeves, what's the protocol?
How long should we stay?

774
00:36:28,961 --> 00:36:34,081
I think a half hour ought to do it. Just
long enough to bring in the New Year.

775
00:36:49,681 --> 00:36:54,914
It's New Year's Eve. Come on,
just for a minute.

776
00:38:04,601 --> 00:38:08,560
There's a plane waiting to take us
to Miami in an hour.

777
00:38:08,761 --> 00:38:11,229
Don't make a big thing about it.

778
00:38:14,721 --> 00:38:18,316
I know it was you, Fredo.
You broke my heart.

779
00:38:19,801 --> 00:38:21,473
You broke my heart!

780
00:39:00,041 --> 00:39:04,990
Due to serious setbacks to our
troops in Guantanamo and Santiago...

781
00:39:05,201 --> 00:39:09,319
...my position in Cuba is untenable.

782
00:39:09,521 --> 00:39:14,436
I am resigning from office
to avoid further bloodshed.

783
00:39:14,641 --> 00:39:17,872
And I shall leave the city immediately.

784
00:39:21,721 --> 00:39:24,758
I wish all of you good luck.

785
00:39:31,641 --> 00:39:34,519
Salud!

786
00:39:35,721 --> 00:39:38,952
Viva la revolución! Viva Fidel!

787
00:39:59,961 --> 00:40:01,394
Fredo!

788
00:40:02,081 --> 00:40:05,835
Come on. Come with me.
It's the only way out of here tonight.

789
00:40:06,441 --> 00:40:08,272
Roth is dead.

790
00:40:09,081 --> 00:40:13,074
Fredo, come with me!
You're still my brother.

791
00:40:14,201 --> 00:40:15,600
Fredo!

792
00:40:39,241 --> 00:40:41,914
I'm Pat Geary, United States Senator.

793
00:41:10,401 --> 00:41:13,552
Fidel! Fidel! Fidel!

794
00:41:52,081 --> 00:41:55,437
Al. Get me a wet towel.

795
00:42:01,881 --> 00:42:04,600
Does Kay know I'm back?

796
00:42:08,241 --> 00:42:11,438
My boy? Did you get him
something for Christmas?

797
00:42:11,641 --> 00:42:14,872
- I took care of it.
- What was it, so I'll know.

798
00:42:15,081 --> 00:42:19,871
It was a little car with an electric motor
that he can ride in. It's nice.

799
00:42:22,361 --> 00:42:24,317
Thank you, Al.

800
00:42:25,161 --> 00:42:28,471
Fellows, could you step outside
for a minute?

801
00:42:44,961 --> 00:42:47,395
Where's my brother?

802
00:42:47,601 --> 00:42:50,673
Roth got out on a private boat.
He's in a hospital in Miami.

803
00:42:50,881 --> 00:42:55,272
He had a stroke, but recovered okay.
Your bodyguard is dead.

804
00:42:55,481 --> 00:42:58,041
I asked about Fredo.

805
00:42:58,241 --> 00:43:02,200
I think he got out.
He must be somewhere in New York.

806
00:43:04,161 --> 00:43:05,753
All right.

807
00:43:06,721 --> 00:43:09,474
I want you to get in touch with him.

808
00:43:09,681 --> 00:43:12,593
I know he's scared.
Tell him everything is all right.

809
00:43:12,801 --> 00:43:17,875
Tell him I know Roth misled him. That
he didn't know they would try to kill me.

810
00:43:18,521 --> 00:43:22,594
- They can come in now.
- There was something else.

811
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:25,193
What?

812
00:43:31,241 --> 00:43:32,913
What? Come on.

813
00:43:35,201 --> 00:43:37,351
Kay had a miscarriage.

814
00:43:49,721 --> 00:43:52,713
- Was it a boy?
- At three and a half months...

815
00:43:52,921 --> 00:43:56,391
Can't you give me a straight answer?!
Was it a boy?

816
00:43:59,081 --> 00:44:01,470
I really don't know.

817
00:44:15,921 --> 00:44:18,799
Poor little Fredo, he's got pneumonia.

818
00:45:02,641 --> 00:45:06,270
Young man, I hear you and
your friends are stealing goods.

819
00:45:06,481 --> 00:45:10,315
But you don't even send a
dress to my house. No respect!

820
00:45:10,521 --> 00:45:13,035
You know I've got three daughters.

821
00:45:13,241 --> 00:45:15,072
This is my neighborhood.

822
00:45:15,281 --> 00:45:18,830
You and your friends should
show me some respect.

823
00:45:19,521 --> 00:45:23,355
You should let me wet
my beak a little.

824
00:45:25,481 --> 00:45:29,440
I hear you and your friends
cleared $600 each.

825
00:45:29,641 --> 00:45:34,271
Give me $200 each, for your own
protection. And I'll forget the insult.

826
00:45:34,481 --> 00:45:39,714
You young punks have to learn
to respect a man like me!

827
00:45:41,561 --> 00:45:44,121
Otherwise the cops will
come to your house.

828
00:45:44,321 --> 00:45:47,597
And your family will be ruined.

829
00:45:47,801 --> 00:45:53,080
Of course if I'm wrong about how much
you stole - I'll take a little less.

830
00:45:53,281 --> 00:45:57,593
And by less, I only mean -
a hundred bucks less.

831
00:45:57,801 --> 00:46:00,156
Now don't refuse me.

832
00:46:01,321 --> 00:46:03,277
Understand, paesano?

833
00:46:08,841 --> 00:46:10,991
I understand.

834
00:46:12,721 --> 00:46:17,875
My friends and I share all the money.
So first, I have to talk to them.

835
00:46:18,681 --> 00:46:23,960
Tell your friends I don't want a lot.
Just enough to wet my beak.

836
00:46:27,041 --> 00:46:29,430
Don't be afraid to tell them!

837
00:46:31,561 --> 00:46:34,394
600 bucks...

838
00:46:34,601 --> 00:46:36,671
Suppose we don't pay?

839
00:46:36,881 --> 00:46:40,317
You know his gang, Tessio.
Real animals.

840
00:46:40,521 --> 00:46:46,073
Maranzalla himself let Fanucci
work this neighborhood.

841
00:46:46,281 --> 00:46:48,511
He's got connections with the cops, too.
We have to pay him.

842
00:46:48,721 --> 00:46:51,110
$200 each...everybody agreed?

843
00:46:55,481 --> 00:46:56,914
Why do we have to pay him?

844
00:46:57,121 --> 00:47:00,318
vito, leave this to us.

845
00:47:00,641 --> 00:47:03,474
He's one person, we're three.

846
00:47:03,681 --> 00:47:06,434
He's got guns, we've got guns.

847
00:47:06,641 --> 00:47:09,633
Why should we give him the
money we sweated for?

848
00:47:09,841 --> 00:47:12,480
This is his neighborhood!

849
00:47:13,681 --> 00:47:18,436
I know two bookies who don't give
anything to Fanucci.

850
00:47:24,841 --> 00:47:27,480
They don't pay Fanucci.

851
00:47:27,681 --> 00:47:32,709
If they don't pay Fanucci, then
somebody else collects for Maranzalla!

852
00:47:32,921 --> 00:47:37,836
We'll all be better off if we
pay him. Don't worry.

853
00:47:52,081 --> 00:47:54,834
Now what I say stays in this room.

854
00:47:55,041 --> 00:48:00,035
If you both like, why not give me
$50 each to pay Fanucci?

855
00:48:02,561 --> 00:48:06,315
I guarantee he'll accept
what I give him.

856
00:48:08,561 --> 00:48:10,597
If Fanucci says $200...

857
00:48:10,801 --> 00:48:12,314
...he means it, vito!

858
00:48:12,521 --> 00:48:15,718
I'll reason with him.

859
00:48:17,601 --> 00:48:19,910
Leave everything to me.

860
00:48:20,121 --> 00:48:23,477
I'll take care of everything.

861
00:48:23,681 --> 00:48:26,753
I never lie to my friends.

862
00:48:26,961 --> 00:48:29,839
Tomorrow you both go talk to Fanucci.

863
00:48:30,041 --> 00:48:32,714
He'll ask for the money.

864
00:48:32,921 --> 00:48:38,632
Tell him you'll pay whatever
he wants. Don't argue with him.

865
00:48:38,841 --> 00:48:41,639
Then I'll go and get him to agree.

866
00:48:41,881 --> 00:48:46,397
Don't argue with him, since
he's so tough.

867
00:48:46,601 --> 00:48:49,673
How can you get him to take less?

868
00:48:49,881 --> 00:48:52,395
That's my business.

869
00:48:52,601 --> 00:48:55,911
Just remember that I did you a favor.

870
00:49:00,121 --> 00:49:02,476
Is it a deal?

871
00:49:49,441 --> 00:49:51,830
His family's out of the house.

872
00:49:52,041 --> 00:49:54,601
Fanucci's alone in the cafe.

873
00:49:58,921 --> 00:50:02,436
vito, here's my 50 dollars.
Buona fortuna.

874
00:50:13,161 --> 00:50:15,959
Are you sure he's going to go for it?

875
00:50:19,001 --> 00:50:23,074
I'll make an offer he don't refuse.
Don't worry.

876
00:50:54,561 --> 00:50:59,840
It looks like there's -
$1 00 under my hat.

877
00:51:10,481 --> 00:51:13,075
I was right.

878
00:51:13,961 --> 00:51:16,236
Only $1 00...

879
00:51:18,881 --> 00:51:22,396
I'm short of money right now.

880
00:51:22,601 --> 00:51:27,675
I've been out of work...so just
give me a little time.

881
00:51:27,881 --> 00:51:30,236
You understand, don't you?

882
00:51:38,121 --> 00:51:41,079
You've got balls, young man!

883
00:51:42,561 --> 00:51:46,395
How come I never heard
of you before?

884
00:51:51,681 --> 00:51:54,639
You've got a lot of guts.

885
00:51:57,961 --> 00:52:00,919
I'll find you some work
for good money.

886
00:52:11,561 --> 00:52:16,271
No hard feelings, right? If I can
help you, let me know.

887
00:52:18,401 --> 00:52:21,154
You've done well for yourself.

888
00:52:24,241 --> 00:52:26,550
Enjoy the festa!

889
00:54:29,921 --> 00:54:32,913
Oh, this is too violent for me!

890
00:56:48,601 --> 00:56:50,557
What've you got there?

891
00:59:22,281 --> 00:59:26,672
Michael, your father loves you
very much.

892
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,229
Mr Cicci, from the year 1942
to the present time,

893
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,750
you were an employee
of the Genco Olive Oil Company?

894
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,473
That's right.

895
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:51,233
But in actuality you were a member
of the Corleone crime organisation.

896
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,073
No, we called it
the Corleone family, Senator.

897
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,635
What was your position?

898
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,158
At first, like everybody else,
I was a soldier.

899
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:07,477
- What is that?
- A button, you know, Senator.

900
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,830
No, I don't know. Tell me.

901
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,479
When the boss says "push a button" on
a guy, I push a button. See, Senator?

902
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,954
Mr Questadt.

903
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,836
You mean you kill people?

904
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:25,670
You kill people at the...
behest of your superiors.

905
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,639
Yeah, that's right.

906
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:36,119
And the head of your family
is Michael Corleone?

907
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:39,073
Yeah, Counsellor. Michael Corleone.

908
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,512
Did you ever get such an order
directly from Michael Corleone?

909
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,676
No, I never talked to him.

910
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:49,475
Mr Cicci, could you amplify
your answer a bit?

911
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,831
- Do what?
- Could you expand on your answer?

912
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:57,750
I'm particularly interested in knowing,
was there always a buffer involved?

913
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,837
Someone in between you
and your superiors who gave the order.

914
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:07,272
Right, a buffer.
The family had a lot of buffers!

915
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:13,189
You may find this very amusing, but
the members of this committee do not.

916
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,389
Tell me something, Ma.

917
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,119
What did Papa think...
deep in his heart?

918
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,519
He was being strong...

919
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:05,914
Strong for his family.

920
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,832
But by being strong for his family...

921
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,070
...could he...

922
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,039
...Iose it?

923
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:31,277
You're thinking about your wife...
about the baby you lost.

924
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:36,399
But you and your wife can
always have another baby.

925
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:41,597
No, I meant...Iose his family.

926
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:46,869
But you can never lose your family.

927
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,910
Times are changing.

928
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,190
It's my pleasure.
I don't want money.

929
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,630
Take it as a gift.

930
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,079
If there's something I can do for you,
you come, we talk.

931
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:50,279
Signora Colombo, why did you
come to see me?

932
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:57,677
Your wife told me to ask
if you could help me.

933
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,269
She's in bad trouble.

934
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:05,190
Her neighbors complained to the
landlord about her dog.

935
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,434
He told her to get rid of the animal.

936
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:14,157
But her little boy loves that dog.
So she hid it.

937
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:18,319
When the landlord found out, he
got mad and told her to leave.

938
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:23,311
Now she can't stay even if she
gets rid of it.

939
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,150
I'm so ashamed!

940
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:31,309
He said he'd get the police to
throw us out on the street.

941
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,996
I'm sorry, but...

942
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,519
I could give you a couple dollars
to help you move.

943
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,233
I can't move!

944
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,550
I want you to talk to him!

945
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:48,911
Tell him I want to stay here!

946
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,470
What's your landlord's name?

947
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,955
His name is Signor Roberto.

948
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,350
He lives on Fourth Street, near here.

949
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:06,675
They break the windows,
they dirty the floors...

950
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:09,314
A real pig-sty, eh?

951
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:31,509
My name is vito Corleone.
Signora Colombo is a friend of my wife.

952
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,917
She says she's been evicted
for no good reason.

953
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,398
She's a poor widow, she has nobody
to take care of her.

954
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:43,639
She has no relatives, no money.
All she has is this neighborhood.

955
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:47,833
I already rented the place
to another family.

956
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:57,434
I told her that I'd talk to you.
That you're a reasonable man.

957
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:02,273
She got rid of the animal that
caused all the trouble.

958
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,232
So let her stay.

959
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,715
Impossible.

960
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:07,989
Are you Sicilian?

961
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,475
No, I'm Calabrese.

962
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,752
We're practically paesani,
do me this favor.

963
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,276
I already rented it!
I'll look like an idiot.

964
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,359
Besides, the new tenants
pay more rent.

965
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,154
How much more a month?

966
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,670
Five bucks.

967
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,593
Here's six months increase in advance.

968
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,713
But don't tell her about it.
She's very proud.

969
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:39,878
Come see me in another six months.

970
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:44,276
Of course, the dog stays. Right?

971
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,879
The dog stays.

972
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:53,435
Who the hell are you
to come give me orders?

973
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:59,431
Watch out or I'll kick your Sicilian ass
right into the street!

974
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,676
Do me this favor.

975
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,510
I won't forget it.

976
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:09,199
Ask your friends in the
neighborhood about me.

977
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:13,473
They'll tell you I know how
to return a favor.

978
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,594
What a character!

979
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:32,916
That landlord is here... Roberto,
the one who owns those ratholes.

980
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:44,039
He's been asking all around
the neighborhood about you.

981
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,678
I hope I'm not disturbing you,
Don vito.

982
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,915
What can I do for you, Don Roberto?

983
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:01,475
What a misunderstanding! Holy Mary!

984
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:06,470
Of course Signora Colombo can stay!

985
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:13,717
I'm giving back the money you gave me.

986
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:20,832
Un, due, three, four, five, six, tutt'!

987
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,911
Because after all, Don vito,
money isn't everything.

988
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,270
Can I sit down?

989
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:41,956
Your kindness to that widow
made me ashamed of myself.

990
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:45,830
The rent stays like before!

991
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,796
I'll even lower it.

992
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,994
I'll lower it $5.

993
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,953
I'll lower it $1 0!

994
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,229
Can I offer you some coffee?

995
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:21,395
I'm late for an appointment! I can't
this time! Ask me another time!

996
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,719
You'll have to excuse me for now.

997
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:36,233
I wish I could stay longer!

998
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,757
Just call me and I'll be here!

999
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:57,077
He won't be back. He'll hide out
in the Bronx!

1000
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:16,469
- vito, what do you think?
- We'll make a big business!

1001
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,559
Would you speak up, please?

1002
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,034
New York City.

1003
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,596
- Are you the son of vito Corleone?
- Yes, I am.

1004
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:35,270
- Where was he born?
- Corleone, Sicily.

1005
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:41,112
Did he at times use an alias that was
known in certain circles as Godfather?

1006
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:47,790
Godfather is a term used by his friends.
One of affection and respect.

1007
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:52,918
Mr Chairman, I would like to verify
the witness' statement.

1008
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:57,989
For years many of my constituents
have been of ltalian descent.

1009
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,156
I've come to know them well.

1010
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:05,111
They have honoured me
with their support and their friendship.

1011
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:10,269
I can proudly say that some of my
very best friends are ltalian-Americans.

1012
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,790
However, Mr Chairman, unfortunately
I have to leave these proceedings,

1013
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,676
in order to preside over a very important
meeting of my own committee.

1014
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,838
Before I leave, I do want to say this,

1015
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:27,999
that these hearings on the Mafia
are in no way whatsoever

1016
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,760
a slur upon the great ltalian people.

1017
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:33,952
I can state from my own knowledge
and experience

1018
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:38,870
that ltalian-Americans are among
the most loyal, most law-abiding,

1019
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:43,198
patriotic, hard-working
American citizens in this land.

1020
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:48,076
It would be a shame, Mr Chairman,
if we allowed a few rotten apples

1021
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,430
to give a bad name to the whole barrel.

1022
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:55,794
Because from the time of Christopher
Columbus to the time of Enrico Fermi,

1023
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,956
to the present day,

1024
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:02,233
Italian-Americans have been pioneers
in building and defending our nation.

1025
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:07,669
They are the salt of the earth, and
one of the backbones of this country.

1026
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:17,069
I'm sure we all agree
with our esteemed colleague.

1027
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:21,159
Mr Corleone, you have been advised
as to your legal rights.

1028
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:27,310
We have testimony from
a previous witness, one Willi Cicci.

1029
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:31,513
He stated that you are head of the most
powerful Mafia family in the country.

1030
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,070
- Are you?
- No, I'm not.

1031
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:37,750
He testified that you are personally
responsible

1032
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:41,191
for the murder of a New York
police captain in 1 947,

1033
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:44,836
and with him a man
named virgil Sollozzo.

1034
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,395
- Do you deny this?
- Yes, I do.

1035
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,512
Is it true that in the year 1 950

1036
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:55,794
you devised the murder of the heads
of the "Five Families" in New York,

1037
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,276
to assume and consolidate
your nefarious power?

1038
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:02,517
- It's a complete falsehood.
- Mr Questadt.

1039
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:07,191
Is it true you have a controlling interest
in three major hotels in Las vegas?

1040
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:13,229
No, it's not true. I own some stock in
some of the hotels there, but very little.

1041
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:19,799
I also have stock in lBM and lT&T.

1042
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:26,758
Do you have any control over gambling
and narcotics in New York State?

1043
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,473
No, I do not.

1044
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:31,831
Senator, my client would like to
read a statement.

1045
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:37,353
Mr Chairman, I think this statement
is totally out of order at this time.

1046
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:43,112
Sir, my client has answered this
committee's questions with sincerity.

1047
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:48,917
He hasn't taken the Fifth Amendment,
so this statement should be heard!

1048
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:55,550
No, I'll allow Mr Corleone to read
his statement. I'll put it in the record.

1049
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,318
In the hopes of clearing
my family name,

1050
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:04,195
to give my children their share
of the American way of life

1051
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,358
without a blemish on their name
and background,

1052
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:12,509
I have appeared before this committee
and given it all my cooperation.

1053
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:18,919
I consider it a great personal dishonour
to have to deny that I am a criminal.

1054
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:23,157
I wish to have the following noted
for the record:

1055
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:27,194
That I served my country faithfully
in World War Two

1056
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:32,349
and was awarded the Navy Cross
for actions in defence of my country.

1057
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:37,153
That I have never been arrested
or indicted for any crime.

1058
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:41,148
That no proof linking me to any
criminal conspiracy,

1059
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:45,797
whether it is called Mafia
or Cosa Nostra or any other name,

1060
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,195
has ever been made public.

1061
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:53,349
I have not taken refuge behind the Fifth
Amendment, although I may do so.

1062
00:17:56,120 --> 00:18:01,433
I challenge this committee to produce
any witness or evidence against me,

1063
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:07,078
and if they do not, I hope they will have
the decency to clear my name

1064
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,750
with the same publicity
with which they have besmirched it.

1065
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:17,479
I'm sure we're impressed. Particularly
with your love for our country.

1066
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,274
We'll be in recess until 1 0 a.m. Monday,

1067
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,996
when we will produce a witness who'll
corroborate the charges against you.

1068
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:30,115
At which time you may very well
be subject to indictment for perjury.

1069
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:34,598
I remind you that you're still
under subpoena. Adjourned!

1070
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:45,436
Ten-to-one shot, you said.
He would take the Fifth, and I'd lose.

1071
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:50,077
You sound like my bookie.
I owe that monkey my life.

1072
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,317
- Well, just get a good night's sleep.
- Yeah.

1073
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,556
You've got a big day tomorrow.

1074
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:00,196
I've got you a new suit,
new shirt, new tie.

1075
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:04,037
I'll shave you myself in the morning.

1076
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:08,199
You'll look respectable for 50 million
of your fellow Americans.

1077
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:13,349
Tomorrow... My life won't be worth
a nickel after tomorrow.

1078
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,596
Come on! I saw this 1 9 times.

1079
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:22,275
You've got a great home here,
for the rest of your life.

1080
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,438
Nobody gets near you,
you're not going anywhere.

1081
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:30,077
That's great. Beautiful.
Some deal I made.

1082
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:33,033
You'll live like a king. You'll be a hero.

1083
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,879
You'll live better here
than most people outside.

1084
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,230
Some deal!

1085
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:44,435
Alive. Pentangeli is alive.

1086
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:51,188
- How did they get their hands on him?
- Roth. He engineered it, Michael.

1087
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:56,278
When Frankie went to make a deal with
the Rosato brothers they tried to kill him.

1088
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,438
He thought you double-crossed him.

1089
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:02,837
Our people with the detectives
said he was half dead, scared,

1090
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:05,600
and shouted that you'd turned on him.

1091
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:10,749
They already had him on possession,
bookmaking, murder one and more.

1092
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:16,958
The FBl has him airtight. He's on
an army base, 24 hour guards.

1093
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:21,910
We can't get to him. You've opened
yourself to five counts of perjury.

1094
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:27,038
What about Fredo?
What does he know?

1095
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:30,710
He says he doesn't know anything,
and I believe him.

1096
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:34,993
Roth, he... played this one beautifully.

1097
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,679
I'm going to talk to Fredo.

1098
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,920
I haven't got a lot to say, Mike.

1099
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,835
We have time.

1100
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:31,998
I was kept pretty much in the dark.

1101
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:36,073
I didn't know all that much.

1102
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:40,876
What about now? Is there anything
you can help me out with?

1103
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,073
Anything you can tell me now?

1104
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,994
They've got Pentangeli.

1105
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:05,635
I didn't know it was going to be
a hit, Mike.

1106
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,990
I swear to God I didn't know.

1107
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:14,838
Johnny Ola bumped into me
in Beverly Hills.

1108
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,518
He said that he wanted to talk.

1109
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:26,950
He said that you and Roth
were in on a big deal together.

1110
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:33,433
And that there was something in it
for me if I could help him out.

1111
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:37,269
He said that you were being tough
on the negotiations,

1112
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:41,632
but if they could get a little help
and close the deal fast...

1113
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,589
...it would be good for the family.

1114
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:51,398
And you believed that story?
You believed that?

1115
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,275
He said there was something in it
for me, on my own!

1116
00:22:55,480 --> 00:23:00,429
- I've always taken care of you, Fredo.
- Taken care of me?!

1117
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:04,309
You're my kid brother!
You take care of me?

1118
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:08,957
Did you ever think about that?
Did you ever once think about that?

1119
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:13,319
"Send Fredo off to do this,
send Fredo off to do that!"

1120
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:18,278
"Let Fredo take care of some
Mickey Mouse nightclub somewhere."

1121
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,199
"Let Fredo fetch somebody at the airport!"

1122
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,478
I'm your older brother,
but was stepped over!

1123
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:28,832
- It's the way Pop wanted it.
- It's not the way I wanted it!

1124
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:33,670
I can handle things, I'm smart!
Not like everybody says.

1125
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:37,589
Like dumb. I'm smart
and I want respect!

1126
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:49,909
Is there anything you can tell me about
this investigation? Anything more?

1127
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:03,397
The senate lawyer, Questadt...
He belongs to Roth.

1128
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,358
Fredo...

1129
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:19,148
...you're nothing to me now.

1130
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:23,349
Not a brother, not a friend.

1131
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,998
I don't want to know you,
or what you do.

1132
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,838
I don't want to see you at the hotels.

1133
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:34,474
I don't want you near my house.

1134
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:40,837
When you see our mother, I want to
know in advance, so I won't be there.

1135
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,675
You understand?

1136
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,191
Mikey.

1137
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:05,838
I don't want anything to happen to him
while my mother's alive.

1138
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:56,430
There's more people
than at a ballgame in here.

1139
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:00,599
- Hey, there's Willi Cicci!
- Frankie Five-Angels...

1140
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,594
This committee will come to order!

1141
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,913
- State your name, please.
- Frank Pentangeli.

1142
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:30,635
- Where were you born?
- Pontenegro, it's outside of Palermo.

1143
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,796
Where do you live now?

1144
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,949
I live in an army barracks
with the FBl guys.

1145
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:43,198
We have here a witness
that will further testify

1146
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:49,475
to Michael Corleone's rule of a criminal
empire that controls all gambling.

1147
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:54,550
This witness has had no buffer between
himself and Michael Corleone.

1148
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:57,513
He can corroborate enough charges

1149
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:02,157
for us to recommend a charge
of perjury against Michael Corleone.

1150
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:04,191
- Senator.
- Thank you, Chairman.

1151
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,833
Mr Pentangeli...

1152
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:13,593
Mr Pentangeli. Were you a member
of the Corleone family?

1153
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:18,351
Did you serve under Caporegime,
Peter Clemenza,

1154
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:22,917
and under vito Corleone,
also known as the Godfather?

1155
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:31,028
I never knew any Godfather.

1156
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,511
I have my own family.

1157
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:41,229
Mr Pentangeli, you...

1158
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:45,353
You are contradicting
your own sworn statement.

1159
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:48,836
I ask you again, sir, here and now
under oath,

1160
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:54,751
were you at any time a member of a crime
organisation led by Michael Corleone?

1161
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:58,313
I don't know nothing about that!

1162
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:04,789
I was in the olive oil business
with his father,

1163
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,514
but that was a long time ago.

1164
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:11,511
We have a sworn affidavit.

1165
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:17,352
Your sworn affidavit, that you murdered
on the orders of Michael Corleone.

1166
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:22,031
Do you deny this confession, and do
you realise what will happen if you do?

1167
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,232
The FBl guys promised me a deal,

1168
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:30,878
so I made up a lot of stuff about
Michael Corleone, just to please them.

1169
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:34,834
But it was all lies. Everything!

1170
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,676
They kept saying,

1171
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:42,670
"Michael Corleone did this"
and "Michael Corleone did that".

1172
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,788
So I said, "Yeah, sure. Why not?"

1173
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:53,518
Mr Corleone, would you kindly identify
the gentleman sitting to your left?

1174
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:56,110
I can answer that.

1175
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:59,278
His name is vincenzo Pentangeli.

1176
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:03,598
- Is he related to the witness?
- He is, I believe, his brother.

1177
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:08,471
- Will he come forward and be sworn?
- He doesn't understand English.

1178
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:12,195
He came at his own expense
to aid his brother.

1179
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:15,710
He's not under subpoena
and has an impeccable reputation.

1180
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:19,310
- He knows nothing about this?
- To my knowledge, nothing.

1181
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:24,270
I'm going to find out what happened!
This committee is now adjourned.

1182
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,471
- The witness is excused.
- Senator!

1183
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:30,990
Senator! This committee
owes an apology!

1184
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:35,314
This committee owes an apology.
Apology, Senator!

1185
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:05,308
- Michael, excuse me.
- Hello, darling.

1186
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:09,070
The children are outside. We're going.

1187
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,914
What do you mean?
We're leaving tomorrow.

1188
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,035
Rocco?

1189
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:19,514
I'll be in my room, Mike.

1190
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:25,158
Michael, I'm not going back to Nevada.

1191
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:28,636
I brought the children
to say goodbye to you.

1192
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,909
I'm very happy for you.

1193
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:38,398
I always knew you were too smart
to let any of them beat you.

1194
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:44,197
- Why don't you sit down?
- No, I'm not going to stay long.

1195
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:47,949
There are some things
I'd like to talk to you about.

1196
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:52,950
Things that have been on my mind,
changes I want to make.

1197
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:56,038
I think it's too late for changes, Michael.

1198
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:01,671
- I wasn't going to say anything...
- What do you mean, "too late"?

1199
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,394
What really happened with Pentangeli?

1200
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:19,949
- His brother came and helped him.
- I didn't even know he had a brother.

1201
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:22,958
Where is he now?

1202
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:25,674
He's on a plane, back to Sicily.

1203
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:28,749
All he had to do was show his face.

1204
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:34,996
It was between the brothers, Kay.
I had nothing to do with it.

1205
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:46,269
Don't tell me you're going.
Not you, not the kids. No.

1206
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:51,148
You're my wife and my children.
I love you and won't allow it.

1207
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:56,069
You say you love me,
but talk about allowing me to leave!

1208
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:59,795
Things between men and women
will not change.

1209
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,709
You've become blind!
Look what's happened to us.

1210
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:08,835
- Look what's happened to our son!
- Nothing's happened to him. He's fine!

1211
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:12,077
- Anthony is not fine!
- I don't want to hear about it.

1212
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:15,989
- Anthony is...
- I don't want to hear about it!

1213
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:19,236
Over!

1214
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:34,759
At this moment
I feel no love for you at all.

1215
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:40,075
I never thought that would ever happen,
but it has.

1216
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,836
Kay...

1217
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,636
We're leaving tomorrow.

1218
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:04,352
Why don't you take the kids
back to their room?

1219
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:10,112
- Michael, you haven't heard me.
- Kay, what do you want from me?

1220
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:16,395
Do you expect me to let you go,
to let you take my children from me?

1221
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:22,433
Don't you know me? Don't you know
that that's an impossibility?

1222
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:26,349
That I'd use all my power
to keep that from happening?

1223
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,430
Don't you know that?

1224
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,832
Kay...

1225
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:40,031
In time, you'll feel differently.

1226
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,353
You'll be glad I stopped you now.

1227
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:48,237
I know that.

1228
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:53,311
I know you blame me
for losing the baby.

1229
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,633
Yes.

1230
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,954
I know what that meant to you.

1231
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:04,633
I'll make it up to you, Kay.

1232
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:07,559
I swear I'll make it up to you. I'll...

1233
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,234
I'm going to change.

1234
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:16,193
I'll change. I've learned that I have
the strength to change.

1235
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:20,958
Then you'll forget about
this miscarriage...

1236
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:26,430
...and we'll have another child.
And we'll go on, you and l.

1237
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:31,719
- We'll go on.
- Oh, Michael!

1238
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:35,070
Michael, you are blind.

1239
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,155
It wasn't a miscarriage.

1240
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,833
It was an abortion.

1241
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:49,549
An abortion, Michael.
Just like our marriage is an abortion.

1242
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:53,316
Something that's unholy and evil!

1243
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:57,873
I didn't want your son, Michael!

1244
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:02,358
I wouldn't bring another one
of your sons into this world!

1245
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:06,155
It was an abortion, Michael.

1246
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:11,793
It was a son - and I had it killed
because this must all end!

1247
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:17,234
I know now that it's over. I knew it then.

1248
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:23,674
There would be no way, Michael,
no way you could ever forgive me.

1249
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:28,351
Not with this Sicilian thing
that's been going on for 2,000...

1250
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:38,791
- You won't take my children.
- I will.

1251
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:43,152
- You won't take my children!
- They're my children too.

1252
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:12,396
Fredo, give this to Grandmother.

1253
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:24,439
Don Ciccio, it's Tommasino.

1254
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:30,638
Allow me the honor of
introducing someone.

1255
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:33,798
My partner in America, in New York.

1256
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,275
His name is vito Corleone.

1257
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:39,119
We'll send him olive oil from here.

1258
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:41,197
To his company in America.

1259
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,758
They're olive oil importers, Don Ciccio.

1260
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:04,279
We'd like your blessing, and your
permission to start work.

1261
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,753
Where is this young man
from New York?

1262
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:14,236
Have him come closer.

1263
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:17,956
I can't see him so good.

1264
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:28,198
My respects, Don Ciccio.
Give me your blessing.

1265
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:32,116
Bless you!

1266
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,353
What's your name?

1267
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:43,511
You took the name of this town!

1268
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:45,517
And what's your father's name?

1269
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:49,235
His name was...Antonio Andolini.

1270
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:53,319
Louder, I don't hear so good.

1271
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:59,511
My father's name was
Antonio Andolini...

1272
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:02,393
...and this is for you!

1273
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:23,108
Michael, say goodbye.

1274
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:26,030
Hi, Al.

1275
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:39,553
Can I speak with you
for a second, Tom?

1276
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,873
Tom, where's Mike?

1277
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:52,833
Waiting for you to leave.

1278
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:58,672
- Can I talk with him?
- Sorry, Fredo. No chance.

1279
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:02,397
- Can I see him?
- He's in the boathouse.

1280
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,275
Michael, it's Connie.

1281
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:39,711
Michael...

1282
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:46,995
I'd like to stay close to home now,
if it's all right.

1283
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:56,108
Is Kay coming?

1284
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:00,158
No.

1285
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:10,317
Fredo's in the house with Mama.

1286
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:14,274
He asked for you
and Tom said you wouldn't see him.

1287
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:19,352
That's right.

1288
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:25,317
Kids, why don't you go outside
for a while?

1289
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,230
Please, I want to talk to you.

1290
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:45,954
Michael, I hated you for so many years.

1291
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:51,474
I think I did things to myself,
to hurt myself, so that you'd know...

1292
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:56,596
...that I could hurt you.

1293
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:06,672
You were just being strong for all of us,
the way Papa was.

1294
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:09,789
And I forgive you.

1295
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:16,233
Can't you forgive Fredo?

1296
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:20,831
He's so sweet,
and helpless without you.

1297
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:30,549
You need me.
I want to take care of you now.

1298
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:42,196
Connie...

1299
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:22,034
Tom, sit down.

1300
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:38,036
Our friend and business partner,
Hyman Roth, is in the news.

1301
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:42,677
- Did you hear about it?
- I hear that he's in lsrael.

1302
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:47,631
The High Court in lsrael
turned down his request to live there.

1303
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:51,276
His passport's been invalidated,
except to return here.

1304
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:54,074
He landed in Buenos Aires yesterday.

1305
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:58,751
He offered them a million dollars
if they'd let him live there.

1306
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:02,748
- They turned him down.
- He's going to try Panama.

1307
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:07,557
Panama won't take him.
Not for a million, not for ten million.

1308
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:12,231
His condition is reported as terminal.
He's only got six months left.

1309
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:15,273
He's had the same heart attack
for 20 years.

1310
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:19,439
- That plane goes to Miami.
- That's right. That's where I want it met.

1311
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:25,680
Impossible. They'll turn him over to the
lnternal Revenue, Customs and FBl.

1312
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:28,838
It's not impossible.
Nothing's impossible.

1313
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:34,592
- There's no way we can get to him!
- Tom, you surprise me.

1314
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:40,876
If anything in this life is certain...

1315
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:44,197
...if history has taught us anything...

1316
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:46,868
...it's that you can kill anyone.

1317
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:56,556
- Rocco?
- Difficult. Not impossible.

1318
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:58,990
Good.

1319
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:04,356
Why did you ask me if something
was wrong when I came in?

1320
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:13,517
I thought you were going to tell me that
you're moving your family to vegas...

1321
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:19,710
...and that you'd been offered the vice
Presidency of the Houstan hotels there.

1322
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:25,839
- I thought you'd tell me that.
- Must I tell you every offer I turn down?

1323
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:31,679
- Let's do business.
- All right.

1324
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:37,674
Just consider this, Michael.
Just consider it.

1325
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:42,431
Roth and the Rosatos are on the run.
Are they worth it, are we strong enough?

1326
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:47,591
Is it worth it? You've won.
Do you want to wipe everybody out?

1327
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:52,874
I don't feel I have to wipe everybody
out, Tom. Just my enemies, that's all.

1328
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:02,760
Are you with me in these things,
or what?

1329
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:09,999
Because if not, you can take your wife,
your family and your mistress,

1330
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:13,158
and move them all to Las vegas.

1331
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:20,950
Why do you hurt me, Michael? I've
always been loyal to you. What is this?

1332
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:27,356
So...you're staying?

1333
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:31,156
Yes, I'm staying.

1334
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:35,995
What do you want me to do?

1335
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:38,111
Hey, Anthony...

1336
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:42,991
How would you like it if I taught you
how to catch the really big fish?

1337
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:45,555
- Would you like that?
- Okay.

1338
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:48,228
You know, when I was your age...

1339
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:55,273
... I went out fishing with all my brothers
and my father. Everybody.

1340
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:59,750
I was the only one that caught a fish.

1341
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:04,593
Nobody else could catch one.
Do you know how I did it?

1342
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:09,755
Every time I put the line in the water
I said a Hail Mary

1343
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:13,396
and every time I said a Hail Mary,
I caught a fish.

1344
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:19,719
Do you believe that? It's true.
That's the secret.

1345
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:25,389
- Do you want to try it out on the lake?
- Okay.

1346
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:27,352
What else have you got?

1347
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:56,354
Everything will be okay.

1348
00:52:56,560 --> 00:53:00,269
- Did my brother go back?
- Yeah, don't worry.

1349
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:05,156
He's ten times tougher than me,
my brother. He's old-fashioned.

1350
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:09,237
He didn't want dinner,
just wanted to go home.

1351
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:14,230
That's my brother! Nothing could get
him away from that two-mule town.

1352
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:18,638
He could have been big here.
He could have had his own family.

1353
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,797
Tom...

1354
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:28,114
...what do I do now?

1355
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:30,717
Frankie...

1356
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:38,954
You were always interested
in politics and history.

1357
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:43,676
I remember you talking about Hitler
back in '33.

1358
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:47,316
Yeah, I still read a lot.
I get good stuff in there.

1359
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:54,999
You were around the old-timers, who
built the organisation of the families,

1360
00:53:55,200 --> 00:54:00,399
basing them on the old Roman legions,
with "regimes", "capos" and "soldiers".

1361
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:05,674
- And it worked.
- Yeah, it worked.

1362
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:09,750
Those were the great old days,
you know.

1363
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:12,872
We was like the Roman Empire.

1364
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:16,356
The Corleone family
was like the Roman Empire.

1365
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:20,517
Yeah...

1366
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:22,995
...it was once.

1367
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:29,356
Frankie...

1368
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:42,116
When a plot against the Emperor failed...

1369
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:46,676
...the plotters were always
given a chance...

1370
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:51,870
...to let their families keep their fortunes.
Right?

1371
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:54,036
Only the rich guys.

1372
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:58,995
The little guys got knocked off and all
their estates went to the Emperors.

1373
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:04,149
Unless they went home and killed
themselves, then nothing happened.

1374
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:09,393
And their families were taken care of.

1375
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:14,191
That was a good break, a nice deal.

1376
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:16,239
Yeah.

1377
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:19,116
They went home...

1378
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:23,118
...and sat in a hot bath...

1379
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:25,709
...opened up their veins...

1380
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:28,480
...and bled to death.

1381
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:33,599
And sometimes they had a little party
before they did it.

1382
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:42,195
Don't worry about anything,
Frankie Five-Angels.

1383
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:45,517
Thanks, Tom. Thanks.

1384
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,560
- See you, Tom.
- Addio, Frankie.

1385
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:19,598
Kay... You have to go.

1386
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:24,629
- So pretty...
- Kay, please hurry. He's coming.

1387
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:36,595
Anthony... Kiss Mama goodbye.

1388
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:41,799
Anthony, kiss your mother goodbye!

1389
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:46,835
Anthony, say goodbye to Mama.
Anthony... I love you, Anthony.

1390
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:50,235
Kay, please.

1391
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:54,871
All right.

1392
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:09,510
Mary, come here.

1393
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:18,192
Anthony...

1394
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:21,233
Anthony, please. Kiss me once.

1395
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:58,356
Easy.

1396
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:06,712
Anthony! Anthony!

1397
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:09,832
- He's here, we're going fishing.
- No!

1398
00:59:10,040 --> 00:59:12,474
Michael wants to take him to Reno now.

1399
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:14,557
Shit!

1400
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:19,476
Okay, kid, you have to go to Reno
with your pop.

1401
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:24,394
- I'll take you fishing tomorrow, okay?
- Okay.

1402
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:29,273
Hey, Anthony...

1403
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:33,632
Listen, I'll catch one for you in secret.

1404
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:37,874
Let's go.

1405
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:20,399
- Mr Roth, I must take you into custody.
- I understand.

1406
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:23,558
What's your reaction
to the lsraeli High Court ruling?

1407
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:26,399
I'm a retired investor on a pension.

1408
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:31,515
I went to lsrael to live there as a Jew,
in the twilight of my life.

1409
01:00:37,360 --> 01:00:40,796
Hey, Frankie! Come on out,
let's play some Hearts.

1410
01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:50,272
Frankie!

1411
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:08,279
Is it true you're worth
over 300 million dollars?

1412
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:11,916
I'm a retired investor,
living on a pension.

1413
01:01:12,120 --> 01:01:15,476
I came home to vote
in the presidential election,

1414
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:18,911
because they wouldn't give me
an absentee ballot.

1415
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:33,075
Jesus Christ.

1416
01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:38,511
Hail Mary, full of grace.
The Lord is with thee.

1417
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:43,037
Blessed art thou amongst women.

1418
01:01:43,240 --> 01:01:46,198
Blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

1419
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:51,393
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners.

1420
01:02:31,560 --> 01:02:36,509
Hey! Everybody, pay attention.
This is my friend Carlo Rizzi.

1421
01:02:37,360 --> 01:02:39,920
- You know my brother Fredo.
- Sure.

1422
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:44,557
This is my stepbrother Tom,
and that's his girl Theresa.

1423
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:47,832
This cute little thing is my sister Connie.

1424
01:02:48,040 --> 01:02:52,318
- Say hello to Carlo. He's good-looking?
- Yes.

1425
01:02:52,520 --> 01:02:56,354
The droopy thing is Mike.
We call him Joe College.

1426
01:02:56,880 --> 01:03:00,509
Sit down. Talk to each other.

1427
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:02,836
Hey, Mr Einstein...

1428
01:03:06,080 --> 01:03:08,435
- The cake.
- Sally, get in here!

1429
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:10,631
- I was scared.
- Come on.

1430
01:03:11,320 --> 01:03:14,471
- Where's your father?
- Christmas shopping.

1431
01:03:14,680 --> 01:03:16,910
Let's see that thing.

1432
01:03:18,280 --> 01:03:20,316
That's nice!

1433
01:03:20,520 --> 01:03:24,195
- Should I put the candles on now?
- Yeah. You help her, Carlo.

1434
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:28,238
- What is that? Rum?
- Yeah.

1435
01:03:33,080 --> 01:03:36,197
Don't touch the antipasto
until Pop sees it.

1436
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:38,914
He's not ugly...

1437
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:49,792
What do you think of the nerve of those
Japs? Bombing us on Pop's birthday.

1438
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:53,470
They didn't know it was Pop's birthday.

1439
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:56,194
Not surprising after the oil embargo.

1440
01:03:56,400 --> 01:04:00,678
They've got no right dropping bombs!
Are you a Jap-lover?

1441
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:04,316
- 30,000 enlisted this morning.
- Bunch of saps...

1442
01:04:04,520 --> 01:04:07,830
- Why are they saps?
- Let's not talk about the war.

1443
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:09,758
You talk to Carlo.

1444
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:15,397
Only saps risk their lives for strangers.

1445
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:18,956
- That's Pop talking.
- You're right, that's Pop talking!

1446
01:04:19,160 --> 01:04:22,550
- They risk their lives for their country.
- Country isn't your blood.

1447
01:04:22,760 --> 01:04:28,437
- I don't feel that way.
- Then quit college and join the army!

1448
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:30,039
I did.

1449
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:34,198
I've enlisted in the Marines.

1450
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:39,391
- Why didn't you come to us?
- What do you mean?

1451
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:43,639
- Pop managed to get you a deferment.
- I didn't ask for it.

1452
01:04:43,840 --> 01:04:45,796
I didn't want it.

1453
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:49,795
Come on! Knock it off!

1454
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:53,549
- Punk!
- Sonny, sit down.

1455
01:04:56,200 --> 01:04:59,510
Mommy, Daddy's fighting again!

1456
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:05,354
Go and show Carlo the tree.

1457
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:16,876
Nice.

1458
01:05:18,320 --> 01:05:20,470
Nice.

1459
01:05:20,680 --> 01:05:23,638
Break your father's heart
on his birthday.

1460
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:26,834
That's swell, Mike. Congratulations.

1461
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:29,076
Don't encourage him!

1462
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:31,840
Get me a drink. Go on!

1463
01:05:35,480 --> 01:05:38,756
You don't understand.
Your father has plans for you.

1464
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:42,953
Many times he and I have talked
about your future.

1465
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:48,349
You've talked to my father
about my future?

1466
01:05:49,640 --> 01:05:53,474
- My future.
- Mikey, he has high hopes for you.

1467
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:59,073
- I have my own plans for my future.
- Did you go to college to get stupid?

1468
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:01,077
He's here!

1469
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:04,791
Come on.

1470
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:08,831
Stupid!

1471
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:27,670
Surprise!

1472
01:06:30,680 --> 01:06:36,073
For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow

1473
01:06:36,280 --> 01:06:40,796
That nobody can deny
Nobody can deny...

1474
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,636
They've killed the boy!
They've killed young Paolo!

1475
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,469
They've killed your son Paolo!

1476
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,831
Murderers! Murderers!

1477
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,673
My son...

1478
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,475
All my respect, Don Ciccio.

1479
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,439
You killed my husband because
he wouldn't give in to you.

1480
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,110
And his oldest son Paolo...

1481
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:00,269
...because he swore revenge.

1482
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,795
But vito is only nine.
And dumb-witted.

1483
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,357
He never speaks.

1484
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,915
It's not his words I'm afraid of.

1485
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:15,317
He's weak. He couldn't hurt anyone.

1486
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,275
But when he grows, he'll grow strong.

1487
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:22,150
Don't worry. This little boy
can't do a thing to you.

1488
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,751
When he's a man, he'll
come for revenge.

1489
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,633
I beg you, Don Ciccio,
spare my only son.

1490
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,156
He's all I have left.

1491
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:46,309
I swear to God he'll never do
you any harm. Spare him!

1492
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,835
Move and I'll kill him!

1493
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,871
Run, vito!

1494
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,474
Kill him!

1495
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:20,675
Any family who hides the boy
vito Andolini will regret it!

1496
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,676
You understand?

1497
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:37,870
Anybody who hides the boy
vito Andolini is in for trouble!

1498
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,359
vito, we're praying for you!

1499
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,039
If anyone is hiding the boy
vito Andolini...

1500
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,550
...turn him over to us.

1501
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,918
Don Ciccio will thank you for it!

1502
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,716
It'll be better for the boy,
and better for you!

1503
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:40,111
Any family who hides the boy
vito Andolini will regret it!

1504
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,320
The nurse.

1505
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,920
- Do you have any money? 
 - No.

1506
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,640
Interpreter.

1507
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,840
Where are you from?

1508
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,840
- What is your name? 
 - Maria.

1509
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,120
What is your name?

1510
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,600
Come on, son. 
 What is your name?

1511
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,680
Vito Andolini from Corleone.

1512
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:11,000
Vito Corleone.

1513
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,440
Okay. Over there.

1514
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:17,520
Next. Your name.

1515
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:27,800
Tell him he has smallpox. 
 Quarantine, three months.

1516
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,960
Vito Corleone?

1517
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,080
Here he is. 
 This is him.

1518
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,760
Did you bring the car keys?

1519
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,400
- Look who's here. 
 - Father Carmelo.

1520
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,600
- This is Father Carmelo. 
 - I'm Merle Johnson.

1521
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:09,200
Nice to meet you. Hi. 
 Excuse me.

1522
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:16,040
- Here I am. 
 - After one week?

1523
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:19,480
I sent the car out to the airport 
 last week to pick you up.

1524
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,920
It was chaos.

1525
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,920
Anyway, here I am, 
 just one week late.

1526
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,520
And this is for my mama.

1527
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,040
- What is this? 
 - You remember Merle, don't you?

1528
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,760
- Hello, Mama. 
 - Yeah, hello.

1529
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,680
How are you? 
 Thank you.

1530
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,360
Where's Michael? 
 I gotta talk to him...

1531
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,600
and get a few things straight, 
 and I can't wait on line.

1532
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,520
You go see your children first...

1533
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:42,960
and then you worry about waiting 
 on line to see your brother...

1534
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,280
Like everybody else.

1535
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:52,640
- Ladies and gentlemen. 
 - Frankie, wake up.

1536
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:55,840
A most distinguished guest 
 would like to say a few words.

1537
00:12:55,960 --> 00:13:00,160
Would you please welcome Senator 
 Pat Geary of the state of Nevada.

1538
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,080
And there's Mrs. Geary.

1539
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,600
Thank you very much, 
 ladies and gentlemen.

1540
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:18,360
And this is a very, 
 very happy day for me...

1541
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,840
and my wife, Mrs. Geary.

1542
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:25,040
We see Nevada far too seldom...

1543
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,120
but particularly today...

1544
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,840
when we can join with old friends, 
 we can make new friends...

1545
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:33,440
and we help celebrate 
 a young man's first communion...

1546
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:37,240
and also to thank 
 that boy's family...

1547
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,320
for a magnificent contribution 
 to the state.

1548
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:44,360
I have here in my hand a check...

1549
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,600
made out to the university...

1550
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:49,360
and it is 
 a magnificent endowment...

1551
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,280
in the name of...

1552
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,400
Anthony Vito Corleone.

1553
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:59,600
And the check is signed 
 by that young man's parents...

1554
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,160
whom I think 
 we should recognize now.

1555
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,720
Mike, Pat, Kay--

1556
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,600
Stand up, please. 
 Let the folks see you.

1557
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,680
Folks, I want you to join with me...

1558
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:11,520
in giving a real 
 Nevada thank-you...

1559
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:14,240
to Mr. and Mrs. Michael Corleone!

1560
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,960
We also have, 
 as a special added attraction...

1561
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,040
the Sierra Boys Choir...

1562
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,520
who have chosen...

1563
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:31,280
a certain special song 
 and a special arrangement...

1564
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:35,160
to honor their host, 
 Mr. Michael Corleone.

1565
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,240
Boys.

1566
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:47,960
- Why this feeling 
 - Why this feeling

1567
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:52,280
- Why this glow 
 -Just why this glow

1568
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,680
The plaque.

1569
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,600
Okay, fellas, I got that one.

1570
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:01,040
Okay, this is yours.

1571
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,960
Senator, just you and Mrs. Corleone.

1572
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,840
- Excuse me. 
 - This is my lawyer Tom Hagen.

1573
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,760
- Senator Geary. 
 - Mr. Hagen.

1574
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:30,800
He's the one who arranged this whole 
 thing through your man Turnbull.

1575
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,040
- Yes, yes. 
 - Sit down.

1576
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:40,160
I was under the impression 
 that you and I would talk alone.

1577
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,600
I trust these men 
 with my life, Senator.

1578
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,720
If I were to ask them to leave, 
 it would be an insult.

1579
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:52,040
It's all right with me, but I should 
 tell you I am a blunt man...

1580
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,840
and I intend to speak 
 very frankly to you...

1581
00:15:54,960 --> 00:16:00,240
more frankly than anyone in my 
 position's talked to you before.

1582
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,920
The Corleone family has done 
 very well here in Nevada.

1583
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:08,160
You own, or you control, 
 two major hotels in Vegas...

1584
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:10,520
one in Reno.

1585
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,680
The licenses 
 were grandfathered in...

1586
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:15,840
so there was no problem 
 with the gaming commission.

1587
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,800
But now my sources tell me that...

1588
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:24,280
you plan to make a move 
 against the Tropigala.

1589
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,640
They tell me that within a week...

1590
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:29,160
you're gonna move Klingman out.

1591
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,320
That's quite an expansion.

1592
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,960
However, it will leave you 
 with one little technical problem.

1593
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,240
The license will still be 
 in Klingman's name.

1594
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,120
Turnbull is a good man.

1595
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:46,040
Yeah, well, let's just-- 
 Let's cut out the bullshit.

1596
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,200
I don't want to spend any more time 
 here than I have to.

1597
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,640
You can have the license.

1598
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,880
The price is $250,000...

1599
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,840
plus a monthly payment 
 of five percent of the gross...

1600
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,560
of all four hotels...

1601
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:01,320
Mr. Corleone.

1602
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:08,720
Now, the price for the license 
 is less than $20,000.

1603
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,640
- Am I right? 
 - That's right.

1604
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:14,320
Now, why would I ever consider 
 paying more than that?

1605
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,480
Because I intend to squeeze you.

1606
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:20,080
I don't like your kind of people.

1607
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,280
I don't like to see you come out 
 to this clean country...

1608
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:24,120
in your oily hair...

1609
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,760
dressed up in those silk suits...

1610
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:31,640
and you try to pass yourselves off 
 as decent Americans.

1611
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,520
I'll do business with you, 
 but the fact is that...

1612
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,320
I despise your masquerade...

1613
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:40,240
the dishonest way 
 you pose yourself--

1614
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,440
yourself and your whole 
 fucking family.

1615
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:52,560
Senator...

1616
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,880
we're both part 
 of the same hypocrisy...

1617
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:00,120
but never think it applies 
 to my family.

1618
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,720
All right, all right.

1619
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:07,120
Some people have to play 
 little games.

1620
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,680
You play yours.

1621
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:14,800
Let's just say that you'll pay me 
 because it's in your interest to.

1622
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:18,640
But I want your answer 
 and the money by noon tomorrow.

1623
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:22,840
And one more thing: 
 Don't you contact me again, ever.

1624
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,760
From now on, you deal with Turnbull. 
 Open that door, son.

1625
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:31,040
Senator, you can have 
 my answer now if you like.

1626
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,680
My offer is this:

1627
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,120
nothing.

1628
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,600
Not even the fee 
 for the gaming license...

1629
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:45,080
which I would appreciate 
 if you would put up personally.

1630
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,920
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

1631
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,680
Ladies. I didn't know 
 you were out here.

1632
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,800
- We have to go. We're late. 
 - Really? I'm sorry.

1633
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:03,400
It's been a delightful party. 
 Thank you for inviting us.

1634
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:06,720
It's been our pleasure. 
 It was wonderful talking to you.

1635
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,720
Fredo, you son ofa bitch!

1636
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,520
You look great!

1637
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,400
Frank Pentangeli!

1638
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:59,120
I thought you was never 
 coming out west, you big bum.

1639
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,720
I gotta check on my boys, huh?

1640
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,360
- What's with the food around here? 
 - What's the matter?

1641
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,040
Kid comes up to me 
 in a white jacket...

1642
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:10,240
gives me a Ritz cracker 
 and a chopped liver...

1643
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,000
he says "canapes."

1644
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:15,040
I said,"Can of peas my ass!

1645
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,320
That's a Ritz cracker 
 and chopped liver."

1646
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:23,320
- Bring out the peppers and sausage. 
 - Hey, Freddie.

1647
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,920
Seeing you reminds me of New York. 
 The old days, huh?

1648
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,200
Hey, Fredo, 
 you remember Willi Cicci?

1649
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,520
We was with old man Clemenza 
 in Brooklyn.

1650
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,520
We were all upset about that.

1651
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,920
Heart attack, huh?

1652
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,840
No, there was no heart attack.

1653
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,280
That's what I'm here to see 
 your brother Mike about.

1654
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,240
- But what's with him? 
 - What do you mean?

1655
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,200
I mean, what do I gotta do? 
 Do I have to get...

1656
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:54,520
a letter of introduction 
 to get a sit-down?

1657
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,040
You can't get in to see Mike?

1658
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,800
He's got me waiting in a lobby!

1659
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,520
-Johnny Ola. 
 - AI Neri.

1660
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,240
Do you know my lawyer 
 Tom Hagen? Johnny Ola.

1661
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:15,840
Sure. I remember Tom 
 from the old days.

1662
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18,760
Rocco, what's this?

1663
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:21,480
It's an orange from Miami.

1664
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:24,240
Take care of Johnny's men. 
 They look like they might be hungry.

1665
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:29,440
- Good to see you. 
 - Tom isn't gonna sit in with us.

1666
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:32,080
He only handles specifiic areas 
 of the family business.

1667
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,000
- Tom? 
 - Sure, Mike.

1668
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,960
What are you drinking, Johnny?

1669
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,400
Anisette.

1670
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,560
If you need anything 
 I'll be outside, all right?

1671
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,480
Just tell Rocco we're waiting.

1672
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:59,720
I just left Mr. Roth in Miami.

1673
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,440
- How's his health? 
 - It's not good.

1674
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,920
Is there anything I can do, 
 anything I can send?

1675
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,320
He appreciates your concern, 
 Michael, and your respect.

1676
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:14,840
That casino you're interested in, 
 the registered owners are...

1677
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:18,800
Jacob Lawrence, Allan Barclay, 
 both Beverly Hills attorneys.

1678
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,720
The real owners are the Lakeville 
 Road group from Cleveland...

1679
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,160
and our friend in Miami.

1680
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,760
Meyer Klingman runs the store.

1681
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:28,400
He owns a piece of it too, 
 and he does all right.

1682
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:31,200
But I've been instructed to tell you 
 that if you move Klingman out...

1683
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,600
our friend in Miami will go along.

1684
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,280
That's very kind of him.

1685
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:40,520
You tell him 
 that's greatly appreciated.

1686
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:44,720
Hyman Roth always makes money 
 for his partners.

1687
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,800
One by one, 
 our old friends are gone.

1688
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,080
Death, natural or not...

1689
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,240
prison, deported.

1690
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:00,400
Hyman Roth is the only one left...

1691
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,600
because he always made money 
 for his partners.

1692
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,920
My God! 
 I can't believe...

1693
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:08,040
out of 30 professional musicians...

1694
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,480
there isn't one Italian 
 in the group here.

1695
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,400
Come on. 
 Let's have a tarantella.

1696
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,520
You, up! Come on! 
 Up, up, up!

1697
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:55,120
I'll see my sister alone.

1698
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,000
It concerns me too. 
 Is it okay if I stay?

1699
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,760
How are you, honey?

1700
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,840
You've met Merle. 
 He was with me in Vegas.

1701
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,680
- I saw him with you. 
 - Could I have a drink or something?

1702
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,880
Al, would you please 
 get him a drink?

1703
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,640
We're going to Europe. I'd like 
 to book passage on the Queen.

1704
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:20,400
So what do you come to me for? 
 Why don't you go to a travel agent?

1705
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,240
We're getting married first.

1706
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,400
The ink on your divorce isn't dry 
 yet, and you're getting married?

1707
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:40,120
You see your children on weekends.

1708
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,520
Your oldest boy 
 was picked up in Reno...

1709
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,760
for some petty theft 
 you don't even know about.

1710
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,880
You fly around the world with men 
 who use you like a whore.

1711
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:50,560
- You're not my father! 
 - Then what do you come to me for?

1712
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,120
'Cause I need money.

1713
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,840
I wanna be reasonable with you.

1714
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,720
Now, why don't you stay here 
 with us, with the family?

1715
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:23,920
You can live here on the estate 
 with your kids.

1716
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,360
You won't be deprived of anything. 
 You can have everything you want.

1717
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:34,440
Now, I don't know this Merle. 
 I don't know what he does.

1718
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,360
I don't know what he lives on.

1719
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,840
Tell him marriage 
 is out ofthe question...

1720
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:42,880
and you don't want 
 to see him anymore.

1721
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,320
He'll understand. 
 Believe me.

1722
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:59,440
If you don't listen to me...

1723
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,400
and marry this man...

1724
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,480
you'll disappoint me.

1725
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,560
What's cent'anni?

1726
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,560
Cent'anni. 
 It means a hundred years.

1727
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:51,600
It means we should all live happily 
 for a hundred years, the family.

1728
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,440
It'd be true 
 if my father were alive.

1729
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:59,880
Merle, you've met 
 my sister-in-law Deanna.

1730
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,480
- Fredo's wife. 
 - A pleasure, Merle.

1731
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,400
- How do you do? 
 - My pleasure.

1732
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,000
What did she mean by that?

1733
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:50,600
What's the matter? 
 I just wanna dance.

1734
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,720
Dancing is one thing. 
 You're falling all over the floor.

1735
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:56,360
I know what's the matter. You're 
 jealous 'cause he's a real man.

1736
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:59,400
I swear to God, I'm gonna 
 belt you right in the teeth.

1737
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,040
You couldn't belt your mama.

1738
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,920
You know something? These dagos are 
 crazy when it comes to their wives.

1739
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:07,840
Michael says that if 
 you can't take care of this...

1740
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:10,160
I have to.

1741
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:12,960
- I think you'd better. 
 - Never marry a Wop!

1742
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:15,840
They treat their wives like shit! 
 I didn't mean to say Wop!

1743
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,760
Stop that!

1744
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,880
What are you doing to me?

1745
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,280
You big slob! Help!

1746
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,360
I can't control her, Mikey.

1747
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:29,800
You're my brother, Fredo. 
 You don't have to apologize to me.

1748
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,320
Clemenza promised 
 the Rosato brothers...

1749
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,320
three territories in the Bronx 
 after he died.

1750
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,320
You took over, 
 and you didn't give it to them.

1751
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,560
- I welched? 
 - You welched.

1752
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:43,480
Clemenza promised them "ugatz."

1753
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,280
Clemenza promised them nothing.

1754
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,520
He hated those son ofa bitches 
 more than I do.

1755
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:50,640
Frankie, they feel cheated.

1756
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:54,160
You're sitting high up 
 in the Sierra Mountains...

1757
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,600
and you're drinking--

1758
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,360
- What's he drinking, Cicci? 
 - Champagne.

1759
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,360
Champagne cocktails.

1760
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,440
And you're passing judgment 
 on how I run my family.

1761
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,760
You're a good old man.

1762
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,400
I like you.

1763
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,160
And you were loyal 
 to my father for years.

1764
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:36,480
The Rosato brothers, 
 they're taking hostages.

1765
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:41,200
And Mike, 
 they spit right in my face...

1766
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,600
all because they're backed up 
 by that Jew in Miami.

1767
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:46,560
I know. That's why 
 I don't want 'em touched.

1768
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,680
- You don't want 'em touched. 
 - No.

1769
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:50,240
I want you to be fair with them.

1770
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,240
You want me to be fair with 'em?

1771
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,280
How can you be fair to animals?

1772
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,680
Tom, for Christ's sakes, listen.

1773
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:01,200
They recruit spics. 
 They recruit niggers.

1774
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:05,120
And they do violence in 
 their grandmothers' neighborhoods.

1775
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:07,760
And I tell ya, 
 everything with them is whores.

1776
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:11,160
Whores and junk. Dope.

1777
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:13,840
And they leave the gambling to last.

1778
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:16,840
Now, I wanna run my family 
 without you on my back...

1779
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:19,880
and I want those 
 Rosato brothers dead.

1780
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:30,200
Now, I have business that's 
 important with Hyman Roth.

1781
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,520
I don't want it disturbed.

1782
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,600
Then you'll give your loyalty 
 to a Jew before your own blood?

1783
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:42,760
Come on. You know my father 
 did business with Hyman Roth.

1784
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,280
He respected him.

1785
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:47,000
Your father did business 
 with Hyman Roth...

1786
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,400
your father respected Hyman Roth...

1787
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,840
but your father 
 never trusted Hyman Roth...

1788
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:55,600
or his Sicilian messenger boy 
 Johnny Ola.

1789
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:05,440
And I want everybody here to know...

1790
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:08,440
there's not gonna be 
 no trouble from me.

1791
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,400
Don Corleone.

1792
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:22,200
You want him to leave now?

1793
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:28,040
Let him go back to New York. 
 I've already made my plans.

1794
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,840
The old man had too much wine.

1795
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:38,880
It's late.

1796
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,160
How's the baby?

1797
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:54,960
Sleeping inside me.

1798
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:58,720
- Does it feel like a boy? 
 - Yes, it does, Michael.

1799
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:06,000
I'm sorry about 
 all the people today.

1800
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,720
Bad timing.

1801
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:10,120
It couldn't be helped, though.

1802
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,720
It made me think 
 of what you once told me.

1803
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:19,280
In five years, the Corleone family 
 will be completely legitimate.

1804
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,200
That was seven years ago.

1805
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,600
I know.

1806
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,200
I'm trying, darling.

1807
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,480
Did you see this?

1808
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:47,560
Michael, why are the drapes open?

1809
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:15,400
- Kay, you all right? 
 - Yeah.

1810
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,920
- Are you hit? 
 - No.

1811
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:22,000
It's over. It's over.

1812
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:26,280
Now! Shut it off!

1813
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,480
Hold it!

1814
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:43,440
They're still on the property. 
 Please, stay inside.

1815
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:45,000
- Keep them alive. 
 - We'll try.

1816
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,240
Rocco! Alive!

1817
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,080
Stay by the door.

1818
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,400
Check by the boathouse!

1819
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,920
Yeah, come in.

1820
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,800
- Mike, are you all right? 
 - Yeah.

1821
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,240
Yeah?

1822
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,840
There's a lot 
 I can't tell you, Tom.

1823
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:28,400
Now, I know that's 
 upset you in the past.

1824
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:33,800
You felt it was because of some 
 lack of trust or confidence...

1825
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:40,400
but it's because 
 I admire you and I love you...

1826
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:42,360
that I kept things 
 secret from you.

1827
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:47,400
That's why at this moment you're 
 the only one I can completely trust.

1828
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,840
Fredo?

1829
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:54,760
Well, he's got a good heart...

1830
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,800
but he's weak and he's stupid...

1831
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,720
and this is life and death.

1832
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:03,120
Tom, you're my brother.

1833
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:11,680
I always wanted to be thought of 
 as a brother by you.

1834
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,240
A real brother.

1835
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,640
I know that.

1836
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:26,440
You're gonna take over.

1837
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:28,800
You're gonna be the don.

1838
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:35,000
If what I think has happened 
 has happened...

1839
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,800
I'm gonna leave here tonight.

1840
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,360
I give you complete power 
 over Fredo and his men--

1841
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:43,480
Rocco, Neri, everyone.

1842
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:50,560
I'm trusting you with the lives 
 of my wife and my children--

1843
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:52,160
the future of this family.

1844
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,520
When we catch these guys...

1845
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,320
do you think we'll be able to 
 find out who's back ofall this?

1846
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,560
We're not gonna catch 'em.

1847
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,200
Unless I'm very wrong, 
 they're dead already.

1848
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:09,720
They were killed by somebody 
 close to us.

1849
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,320
Inside.

1850
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,960
Very, very frightened 
 they botched it.

1851
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:16,240
Yeah, but your people, 
 Rocco and Neri...

1852
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:18,440
you don't think that they had 
 something to do with this?

1853
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:26,040
See, all our people 
 are businessmen.

1854
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,320
Their loyalty's based on that.

1855
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,720
One thing I learned from Pop...

1856
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:39,760
was to try to think 
 as people around you think.

1857
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:45,000
Now, on that basis, 
 anything's possible.

1858
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:50,400
I seen them! 
 Right out my window!

1859
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:53,080
I wanna get out of here! 
 They're lying there dead!

1860
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,440
Get her inside!

1861
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:07,080
Over here. 
 There's two of'em.

1862
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:08,880
Looks like they were 
 hired out of New York.

1863
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,160
I don't recognize 'em.

1864
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:14,360
We won't get anything 
 out of them now.

1865
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,960
Fish 'em out.

1866
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:42,280
All right, get rid of the bodies.

1867
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:44,280
- Where's Mike? 
 - Rocco.

1868
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:17,520
Anthony, everything's 
 gonna be all right.

1869
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:19,120
Try to sleep.

1870
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:37,320
Did you like your party?

1871
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:38,920
I got lots of presents.

1872
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,640
I know. 
 Did you like 'em?

1873
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:45,280
I didn't know the people 
 who gave them to me.

1874
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:48,480
Well, they're my friends.

1875
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,560
Did you see my present for you?

1876
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:54,480
It was on my pillow.

1877
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,920
Anthony, I'm going to be leaving 
 very early tomorrow.

1878
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:03,080
Will you take me?

1879
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:06,360
- No, I can't, Anthony. 
 - Why do you have to go?

1880
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:10,440
'Cause I have to do business.

1881
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:12,360
I could help you.

1882
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:18,200
Well, someday you will.

1883
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,760
Get some sleep.

1884
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:31,800
Good night.

1885
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:46,800
Vito. Come on.

1886
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:50,840
We'll go see her backstage.

1887
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:01,000
Come here.

1888
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,920
Vito. Come here. Come on.

1889
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:49,920
Come here.

1890
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:25,160
You speak Italian?

1891
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:29,360
Yeah, sure.

1892
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:22,240
Come on in.

1893
00:59:24,040 --> 00:59:26,800
It's all right. Come on. 
 Hyman's in there.

1894
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:29,760
I was just making some lunch. 
 Would you like a tuna sandwich?

1895
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:31,680
Uh, no, thankyou.

1896
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:39,760
Pickup of two by Holden. 
 Second and eight for S.C...

1897
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:42,120
and the ball is at 
 the Trojan 38-yardline.

1898
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:43,400
Mr. Roth?

1899
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:45,320
Come in, Michael.

1900
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:50,040
Sit down. 
 Make yourself comfortable.

1901
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:53,840
It's almost over.

1902
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:57,640
You follow the football game?

1903
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:01,000
- Pickup offive. 
 - Not for a while I haven't.

1904
01:00:01,080 --> 01:00:03,800
I enjoy watching football 
 in the afternoon.

1905
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:06,720
One of the things I love 
 about this country.

1906
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:08,840
Baseball too.

1907
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:10,720
I've loved baseball...

1908
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:14,680
ever since Arnold Rothstein 
 fixed the World Series in 1919.

1909
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:18,040
...47. Marked down there, 
 say the officials.

1910
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:20,640
And at that point 
 it'll be first and ten--

1911
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:22,240
I heard you had some trouble.

1912
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:25,160
It'll be third and ten, another 
 of those big plays now...

1913
01:00:25,240 --> 01:00:27,800
- Stupid. 
 - coming up for S.C.

1914
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:30,080
People behaving like that 
 with guns.

1915
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:32,640
...but it looks like 
 it could stall here.

1916
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:35,400
The important thing is, 
 you're all right.

1917
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:39,280
Good health. 
 The most important thing.

1918
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:41,800
More than success. 
 More than money.

1919
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:44,560
- Now he's back to pass. 
 - More than power.

1920
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:46,680
Rolls up field for Hayes. 
 He's intercepted.

1921
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:52,240
Hurd has it to the Irish 40. 
 To the far sideline. Gets by the 45.

1922
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:56,520
He's hit and dropped 
 at the S.C. 42-yardline.

1923
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:59,120
Notre Dame's first bigbreak 
 of the game.

1924
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:02,880
I came here because there's 
 gonna be more bloodshed.

1925
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:05,200
I want you to know about it 
 before it happens...

1926
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:07,680
so that there's no danger 
 of starting another war.

1927
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:10,680
Nobody wants another war.

1928
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:14,320
Frank Pentangeli came to my home 
 and he asked my permission...

1929
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:15,880
to get rid of the Rosato brothers.

1930
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:18,200
When I refused, 
 he tried to have me killed.

1931
01:01:18,320 --> 01:01:21,640
He was stupid. I was lucky. 
 I'll visit him soon.

1932
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:24,920
The important thing is that 
 nothing interfere...

1933
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:26,840
with our plans for the future.

1934
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:30,480
- Yours and mine. 
 - Nothing is more important.

1935
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:32,040
Good.

1936
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:34,920
You're a wise 
 and considerate young man.

1937
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,760
And you're a great man, 
 Mr. Roth.

1938
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:41,720
- There's much I can learn from you. 
 - What can I do to help, Michael?

1939
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:44,560
To the 32, and is downed there 
 by Danny Zika.

1940
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:47,040
- Excuse me. Lunch. 
 - Oh.

1941
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:48,960
- Okay. 
 - Ohh!

1942
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:51,840
Hyman, you're gonna 
 break my ear drums.

1943
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:55,000
- Okay, enjoy it. 
 - Thanks.

1944
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:04,560
You're young. 
 I'm old and sick.

1945
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:07,320
What we'll do together 
 in the next few months...

1946
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:09,480
will make history, Michael.

1947
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:12,360
History. 
 It's never been done before.

1948
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:16,600
Not even your father would dream 
 that such a thing could be possible.

1949
01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:21,400
And Pentangeli is a dead man.

1950
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:24,440
- You don't object? 
 - Pickup of four.

1951
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:26,360
He's small potatoes.

1952
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:39,080
What's up?

1953
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:43,000
We got company, huh?

1954
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:24,400
Don Corleone, I wish you would've 
 let me know you were comin'.

1955
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:26,880
I could've prepared 
 something for you.

1956
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,760
I didn't want you to know 
 I was coming.

1957
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:37,480
You heard what happened 
 in my home?

1958
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:41,360
- Mike, I almost died myself. 
 - In my home!

1959
01:03:44,680 --> 01:03:47,480
In my bedroom 
 where my wife sleeps!

1960
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:53,920
Where my children come 
 and play with their toys.

1961
01:03:54,040 --> 01:03:55,840
In my home.

1962
01:04:12,280 --> 01:04:15,200
I want you to help me 
 take my revenge.

1963
01:04:15,320 --> 01:04:17,240
Michael, anything.

1964
01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:19,160
What can I do?

1965
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:24,960
Settle these troubles 
 with the Rosato brothers.

1966
01:04:25,080 --> 01:04:27,600
Mike, I don't understand. 
 I don't--

1967
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:30,320
I don't have your brain 
 for big deals...

1968
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:32,080
but this is a street thing.

1969
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:35,160
That Hyman Roth in Miami. 
 That--

1970
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:37,320
He's backin' up 
 those son-of-a-bitches.

1971
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:38,320
I know.

1972
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:41,600
Then why? Why do you ask me 
 to lay down to him, Mike?

1973
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:50,680
It was Hyman Roth that 
 tried to have me killed.

1974
01:04:52,440 --> 01:04:55,440
I know it was him.

1975
01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:57,800
Jesus Christ, Mike.

1976
01:04:57,880 --> 01:04:59,720
Jesus Christ, look, 
 let's get 'em all.

1977
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:03,000
Let's hit 'em all now, 
 while we got the muscle.

1978
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:09,760
This used to be 
 my father's old study.

1979
01:05:11,320 --> 01:05:13,120
It's changed.

1980
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:16,800
I remember 
 there used to be a--

1981
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:18,720
A big desk was here.

1982
01:05:21,600 --> 01:05:23,440
I remember when I was a kid, 
 Frankie...

1983
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:25,840
we had to be very quiet 
 when we played near here.

1984
01:05:33,720 --> 01:05:36,960
I was very happy that this 
 house never went to strangers.

1985
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:41,640
First Clemenza took it over. 
 Now you.

1986
01:05:44,120 --> 01:05:46,680
My father taught me 
 many things here.

1987
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:49,080
He taught me in this room.

1988
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:55,680
He taught me, 
 keep your friends close...

1989
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:58,000
but your enemies closer.

1990
01:05:58,080 --> 01:06:01,360
Now, if Hyman Roth sees that 
 I interceded in this thing...

1991
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:04,200
in the Rosato brothers' favor...

1992
01:06:04,280 --> 01:06:07,000
he's gonna think his relationship 
 with me is still good.

1993
01:06:10,320 --> 01:06:13,280
That's what I want him to think.

1994
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:17,880
I want him completely relaxed 
 and confident in our friendship.

1995
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:21,720
Then I'll be able to find out 
 who the traitor in my family was.

1996
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:52,200
- Yeah? 
 - Fredo. This is Johnny.

1997
01:06:52,280 --> 01:06:54,600
Johnny Ola. 
 We need some more help.

1998
01:06:54,680 --> 01:06:56,760
Johnny?

1999
01:06:56,880 --> 01:06:59,640
Jesus Christ, 
 what the hell time is it?

2000
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:02,600
- Who is that, honey? 
 - Listen good, Fredo.

2001
01:07:02,680 --> 01:07:05,600
What are you callin' me here for? 
 I don't want to talk to you.

2002
01:07:05,720 --> 01:07:07,840
Pentangeli's set up a meeting 
 with the Rosato brothers.

2003
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:10,200
- He's gonna go for their deal. 
 - Oh, God.

2004
01:07:10,280 --> 01:07:12,720
- Will he come alone? 
 - I don't know anything.

2005
01:07:12,800 --> 01:07:15,280
- You got me in deep enough already. 
 - Just go along.

2006
01:07:15,360 --> 01:07:17,280
Everything will be allright, 
 Fredo.

2007
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:19,600
Pentangeli says he's 
 willing to make a deal.

2008
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:22,480
All we wanna know is 
 if he's on the level.

2009
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,920
You guys lied to me. I don't 
 want you to call me anymore.

2010
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,400
Your brother's not gonna 
 find out we talked.

2011
01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:32,280
I don't know 
 what you're talkin' about.

2012
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:43,640
Who was that?

2013
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:45,560
Uh, wrong number.

2014
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:55,280
Frank, I got nobody here.

2015
01:07:55,360 --> 01:07:57,200
- Wait in the car, Cheech. 
 - Frankie--

2016
01:07:57,280 --> 01:07:59,120
It's okay, Cheech.

2017
01:08:05,960 --> 01:08:09,240
- What's this, Rosato? 
 - A lucky "C" note for our new deal.

2018
01:08:12,520 --> 01:08:14,840
Richie. 
 Give us a taste, huh?

2019
01:08:19,320 --> 01:08:23,120
Yeah, we're all real happy 
 about your decision, Frankie.

2020
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:27,480
- You're not gonna regret it. 
 - I don't like this "C" note.

2021
01:08:27,560 --> 01:08:29,920
I take that as an insult.

2022
01:08:30,040 --> 01:08:32,160
Michael Corleone says hello.

2023
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:51,520
Get him in! 
 Close the fuckin' door!

2024
01:08:51,640 --> 01:08:53,920
Your friend the cop. 
 What the--

2025
01:08:54,040 --> 01:08:56,640
Hey, Rich, it's dark in here.

2026
01:08:56,760 --> 01:09:00,960
- Are you open or closed? 
 - I just come in to clean up.

2027
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:06,440
What's the matter?

2028
01:09:06,520 --> 01:09:09,400
- Is that somethin' on the floor? 
 - Carmine, no, no. Not here!

2029
01:09:09,480 --> 01:09:11,840
- Not here! 
 - Not here, Carmine! Not a cop!

2030
01:09:11,960 --> 01:09:13,760
What?

2031
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:17,200
You open your fuckin' mouth, 
 I'll blow your head off!

2032
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:03,120
Freddie. Good to see ya.

2033
01:10:05,880 --> 01:10:07,720
Where is he?

2034
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:10,360
He's okay. He's in the back.

2035
01:10:14,200 --> 01:10:16,520
Come on, girls. 
 Take a hike, huh?

2036
01:10:19,480 --> 01:10:21,320
In this room here.

2037
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:27,000
- I wanna talk to him alone first. 
 - Come on, huh?

2038
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:38,640
I thought I could 
 help you, Senator.

2039
01:10:42,360 --> 01:10:44,520
Hagen?

2040
01:10:45,320 --> 01:10:48,240
- Listen, Hagen, I did not-- 
 - No.

2041
01:10:48,360 --> 01:10:50,320
- It's all right. 
 - I didn't do anything.

2042
01:10:50,440 --> 01:10:52,480
It's okay.

2043
01:10:52,600 --> 01:10:54,760
You're very lucky.

2044
01:10:54,840 --> 01:10:57,240
My brother Fredo 
 operates this place.

2045
01:10:57,320 --> 01:11:00,000
He was called before anyone.

2046
01:11:00,120 --> 01:11:01,760
Now, if this had happened 
 someplace else...

2047
01:11:01,880 --> 01:11:02,880
we couldn't 
 have helped you.

2048
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:11,040
When I woke up 
 I was on the floor...

2049
01:11:11,160 --> 01:11:12,960
and I don't know 
 how it happened.

2050
01:11:13,080 --> 01:11:14,880
You can't remember?

2051
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:20,400
I passed out.

2052
01:11:26,080 --> 01:11:27,920
I'll fix it.

2053
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:29,880
Okay.

2054
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:37,920
It was just a game.

2055
01:11:38,040 --> 01:11:39,360
Jesus.

2056
01:11:42,040 --> 01:11:43,840
Oh.

2057
01:11:49,080 --> 01:11:51,120
Jesus! Jesus!

2058
01:11:55,400 --> 01:11:58,000
Jesus God.

2059
01:11:58,120 --> 01:11:59,960
Oh, God.

2060
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:05,760
I don't know and I don't 
 understand why I can't remember.

2061
01:12:05,880 --> 01:12:08,600
You don't have to remember. 
 Just do as I say.

2062
01:12:08,680 --> 01:12:11,160
They're putting a call in 
 to your office.

2063
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:15,040
Explain that you'll be there 
 tomorrow afternoon.

2064
01:12:15,160 --> 01:12:17,200
You decided to spend the night...

2065
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:21,040
at Michael Corleone's house 
 in Tahoe as his guest.

2066
01:12:21,720 --> 01:12:24,480
I do remember 
 that she was laughing.

2067
01:12:26,360 --> 01:12:28,200
We'd done it before...

2068
01:12:28,280 --> 01:12:31,480
and I know that I could 
 not have hurt that girl.

2069
01:12:32,600 --> 01:12:34,400
This girl has no family.

2070
01:12:34,520 --> 01:12:36,400
Nobody knows 
 that she worked here.

2071
01:12:36,520 --> 01:12:38,880
It'll be as though 
 she never existed.

2072
01:12:41,480 --> 01:12:43,800
All that's left 
 is our friendship.

2073
01:12:58,840 --> 01:13:00,680
- Yes? 
 - I'm sorry, Mrs. Corleone.

2074
01:13:00,760 --> 01:13:04,560
- We're not to let you through. 
 - I'm just going to the market.

2075
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:07,120
Well, if you'll just give us a list, 
 we'll pick up anything you want.

2076
01:13:07,240 --> 01:13:10,320
- Whose orders are these? 
 - Mr. Hagen's, ma'am. He's coming.

2077
01:13:10,440 --> 01:13:13,440
All right, well, I'm just gonna 
 have to speak to Mr. Hagen.

2078
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:22,000
I wanted to explain this, but 
 I had business in Carson City.

2079
01:13:22,120 --> 01:13:24,080
Now, this is Michael's 
 request for your safety.

2080
01:13:24,160 --> 01:13:26,640
- We can send out for anything. 
 - I see.

2081
01:13:26,760 --> 01:13:28,640
I'm supposed to stay 
 in my house.

2082
01:13:28,760 --> 01:13:31,120
No, within the compound 
 would be fine.

2083
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:33,400
I was going to take the children 
 to New England next week.

2084
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:36,600
- That's off now. 
 - Am I a prisoner? Is that it?

2085
01:13:36,720 --> 01:13:39,080
- That's not the way we look at it. 
 - All right, come on, kids.

2086
01:13:39,160 --> 01:13:41,000
We're going back to the house.

2087
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:45,080
Joe.

2088
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:30,640
Cuba! Cuba!

2089
01:15:10,120 --> 01:15:12,920
Most respected gentlemen...

2090
01:15:13,040 --> 01:15:15,120
allow me to welcome you 
 to the city of Havana.

2091
01:15:17,160 --> 01:15:21,960
I want to thank this distinguished 
 group of American industrialists...

2092
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:25,720
for continuing to work 
 with Cuba...

2093
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:29,520
toward the greatest period 
 of prosperity...

2094
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:32,920
in her entire history.

2095
01:15:34,360 --> 01:15:38,200
Mr. William Shaw, representing 
 the General Fruit Company;

2096
01:15:40,040 --> 01:15:41,840
Misters Corngold and Dant...

2097
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:44,600
of United Telephone 
 and Telegraph Company;

2098
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:48,960
Mr. Petty, 
 regional vice president...

2099
01:15:49,080 --> 01:15:51,360
of the Pan American 
 Mining Corporation;

2100
01:15:53,960 --> 01:15:56,080
Mr. Robert Allen 
 of South American Sugar;,

2101
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:00,360
Mr. Michael Corleone of Nevada...

2102
01:16:02,160 --> 01:16:05,320
representing our associates in 
 tourism and leisure activities;

2103
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:09,560
and my old friend and associate 
 from Florida...

2104
01:16:11,640 --> 01:16:13,680
Mr. Hyman Roth.

2105
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:15,480
I would like to take this 
 opportunity...

2106
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:17,400
to thank United 
 Telephone and Telegraph...

2107
01:16:17,480 --> 01:16:19,320
for their lovely Christmas gift:

2108
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:25,560
a solid gold telephone.

2109
01:16:28,200 --> 01:16:31,000
Perhaps you gentlemen would 
 like to take a look at it.

2110
01:16:32,440 --> 01:16:34,080
- Mr. President. 
 - Yes?

2111
01:16:34,200 --> 01:16:37,120
Perhaps you would discuss 
 the status of rebel activity...

2112
01:16:37,240 --> 01:16:39,840
and what this can mean 
 to our businesses.

2113
01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:41,360
- Of course. 
 - Very lovely.

2114
01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:43,800
I want to assure you 
 that although the rebels...

2115
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:46,960
have mounted an impressive 
 campaign in Las Villas...

2116
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:55,160
my staff indicates 
 with assurance...

2117
01:16:55,280 --> 01:16:59,960
we'll drive them out of the city 
 of Santa Clara before the new year.

2118
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:04,920
And I want to put you all 
 at ease.

2119
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:08,760
We will tolerate no guerillas 
 in the casinos or swimming pools.

2120
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:28,720
He say that they are 
 making arrest...

2121
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:31,600
and in a few minutes 
 he'll let us through.

2122
01:17:32,120 --> 01:17:34,080
Johnny.

2123
01:17:55,680 --> 01:17:58,680
Well, I hope my age 
 is correct.

2124
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:01,760
I'm always accurate 
 about my age.

2125
01:18:01,880 --> 01:18:05,280
Make sure that everybody 
 sees the cake before we cut it.

2126
01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:11,560
I'm very pleased...

2127
01:18:11,640 --> 01:18:14,440
you were all able to come 
 from such distances...

2128
01:18:14,520 --> 01:18:15,680
to be with me today.

2129
01:18:17,560 --> 01:18:20,120
When a man comes 
 to this point in his life...

2130
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:24,920
he wants to turn over the 
 things he's been blessed with--

2131
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:26,920
turn them over to friends--

2132
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:31,080
as a reward 
 for the friends he's had...

2133
01:18:31,160 --> 01:18:36,200
and to make sure that everything 
 goes well after he's gone.

2134
01:18:36,280 --> 01:18:38,840
- Not for years. 
 - Hear, hear.

2135
01:18:38,960 --> 01:18:42,640
The doctors would disagree, 
 but what do they know?

2136
01:18:44,080 --> 01:18:48,880
These are wonderful things 
 that we've achieved in Havana...

2137
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,920
and there's no limit to 
 where we can go from here.

2138
01:18:52,040 --> 01:18:56,600
This kind of government knows how 
 to help business, to encourage it.

2139
01:18:56,720 --> 01:19:00,560
The hotels here 
 are bigger and swankier...

2140
01:19:00,680 --> 01:19:03,200
than any of the rough joints 
 we've put in in Vegas.

2141
01:19:03,320 --> 01:19:06,520
And we can thank our friends 
 in the Cuban government...

2142
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:09,480
which has put up half of the cash, 
 with the Teamsters...

2143
01:19:09,560 --> 01:19:11,040
on a dollar-for-dollar basis;

2144
01:19:11,160 --> 01:19:13,880
has relaxed restrictions 
 on imports.

2145
01:19:13,960 --> 01:19:18,200
What I'm saying is that we have now 
 what we have always needed:

2146
01:19:18,280 --> 01:19:20,920
real partnership 
 with a government.

2147
01:19:21,040 --> 01:19:23,520
Smaller piece.

2148
01:19:23,640 --> 01:19:26,080
You all know Michael Corleone...

2149
01:19:26,200 --> 01:19:28,320
and we all remember his father.

2150
01:19:28,440 --> 01:19:31,920
At the time of my retirement 
 or death...

2151
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:36,280
I turn over all my interest 
 in the Havana operation...

2152
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:37,560
to his control.

2153
01:19:37,680 --> 01:19:41,560
But all of you will share.

2154
01:19:41,680 --> 01:19:45,200
The Nacionale will go to 
 the Lakeville Road boys.

2155
01:19:45,320 --> 01:19:50,960
The Capri to the Corleone family. 
 The Sevilla Biltmore also.

2156
01:19:51,040 --> 01:19:54,760
But Eddie Levine of Newport will 
 bring in the Pennino brothers...

2157
01:19:54,840 --> 01:19:56,560
Dino and Eddie, for a piece...

2158
01:19:56,640 --> 01:19:59,360
and also to handle 
 the actual casino operations.

2159
01:19:59,480 --> 01:20:02,840
And we've saved a piece for 
 some friends in Nevada...

2160
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:06,480
to make sure that things 
 go smooth back home.

2161
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:11,320
I want all of you 
 to enjoy your cake...

2162
01:20:11,440 --> 01:20:13,240
so enjoy.

2163
01:20:13,360 --> 01:20:15,160
- Happy birthday. 
 - Happy birthday.

2164
01:20:16,920 --> 01:20:20,720
I saw an interesting thing 
 happen today.

2165
01:20:20,840 --> 01:20:23,840
A rebel was being arrested 
 by the military police...

2166
01:20:23,960 --> 01:20:25,640
and rather than be taken alive...

2167
01:20:25,720 --> 01:20:28,240
he exploded a grenade he had 
 hidden in his jacket.

2168
01:20:28,360 --> 01:20:31,640
He killed himself, and he took 
 a captain of the command with him.

2169
01:20:31,720 --> 01:20:33,840
- Right, Johnny? 
 - Those rebels, they're lunatics.

2170
01:20:33,920 --> 01:20:37,040
- Yes, I agree. 
 - Maybe so.

2171
01:20:37,160 --> 01:20:38,680
But it occurred to me...

2172
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:42,000
the soldiers are paid to fight, 
 the rebels aren't.

2173
01:20:42,080 --> 01:20:44,160
What does that tell you?

2174
01:20:44,280 --> 01:20:46,080
They could win.

2175
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:50,520
This country has had rebels 
 for the last 50 years.

2176
01:20:50,640 --> 01:20:55,080
It's in their blood. I've been 
 coming here since the '20s.

2177
01:20:55,160 --> 01:20:58,840
We were running molasses out 
 of Havana when you were a baby...

2178
01:20:58,960 --> 01:21:02,400
the trucks owned by your father.

2179
01:21:02,520 --> 01:21:04,880
Michael.

2180
01:21:10,720 --> 01:21:13,520
I'd rather we talked about 
 this when we we're alone.

2181
01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:19,120
The two million 
 never got to the island.

2182
01:21:24,720 --> 01:21:27,720
I wouldn't want it to get around 
 that you held back the money...

2183
01:21:27,800 --> 01:21:31,040
because you had second thoughts 
 about the rebels.

2184
01:21:36,200 --> 01:21:39,000
Ah, sit down, Michael.

2185
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:40,920
Sit down.

2186
01:21:47,160 --> 01:21:50,840
If I could only live to see it, 
 to be there with you.

2187
01:21:50,920 --> 01:21:53,160
Ohh.

2188
01:21:53,240 --> 01:21:55,640
What I wouldn't give for...

2189
01:21:55,720 --> 01:21:57,560
20 more years.

2190
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:01,480
Here we are, protected--

2191
01:22:01,560 --> 01:22:03,560
free to make our profiits without 
 Kefauver...

2192
01:22:03,640 --> 01:22:07,200
the goddamn Justice 
 Department and the FBl--

2193
01:22:07,320 --> 01:22:10,680
90 miles away, partnership 
 with a friendly government.

2194
01:22:12,080 --> 01:22:16,080
Ninety miles. It's nothing.

2195
01:22:16,200 --> 01:22:18,640
Just one small step, 
 looking for a man...

2196
01:22:18,760 --> 01:22:21,800
that wants to be President 
 of the United States...

2197
01:22:21,880 --> 01:22:25,120
and having the cash 
 to make it possible.

2198
01:22:25,240 --> 01:22:27,040
Michael...

2199
01:22:28,600 --> 01:22:31,320
we're bigger than U.S.Steel.

2200
01:22:56,440 --> 01:22:58,720
Mikey, how are ya? Okay?

2201
01:23:00,680 --> 01:23:03,280
Hiya. Freddie Corleone.

2202
01:23:06,360 --> 01:23:08,560
Jesus Christ, what a trip.

2203
01:23:08,640 --> 01:23:10,040
The whole time I'm thinkin'...

2204
01:23:10,120 --> 01:23:12,120
"What if somebody knows 
 what I got in here?"

2205
01:23:12,240 --> 01:23:16,400
Imagine that. Two million dollars 
 on the seat next to me.

2206
01:23:16,480 --> 01:23:18,320
All right.

2207
01:23:19,800 --> 01:23:22,120
- Whoops. Excuse me. 
 - No, it's okay.

2208
01:23:24,320 --> 01:23:26,160
You wanna count it?

2209
01:23:30,400 --> 01:23:33,720
Mikey, what the hell's 
 goin' on anyway?

2210
01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:35,960
The family's making 
 an investment in Havana.

2211
01:23:36,080 --> 01:23:39,280
- This is a gift for the president. 
 - Oh.

2212
01:23:39,360 --> 01:23:41,240
Well, that's great.

2213
01:23:41,360 --> 01:23:43,160
Havana's great.

2214
01:23:44,240 --> 01:23:46,040
It's my kind of town.

2215
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:49,520
- Anybody I know in Havana? 
 - I don't know.

2216
01:23:49,640 --> 01:23:51,520
Hyman Roth? Johnny Ola?

2217
01:23:54,840 --> 01:23:57,280
No. I never met them.

2218
01:24:00,920 --> 01:24:03,120
Listen, Mikey...

2219
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:05,040
I'm kind of, uh--

2220
01:24:08,440 --> 01:24:09,760
kind of nervous from the trip.

2221
01:24:09,880 --> 01:24:13,360
Uh, can I-- can I get 
 a, uh, drink or somethin'?

2222
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:16,560
I thought maybe we'd-- 
 we'd go out together.

2223
01:24:16,680 --> 01:24:19,480
I know a place we can spend 
 some time together. Okay?

2224
01:24:21,880 --> 01:24:24,880
Sometimes I think I should've 
 married a woman like you did...

2225
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,320
Like Kay.

2226
01:24:27,400 --> 01:24:29,720
Have kids, have a family.

2227
01:24:32,280 --> 01:24:35,520
For once in my life 
 be more like...

2228
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:38,400
Pop.

2229
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:45,120
It's not easy to be a son, 
 Fredo. It's not easy.

2230
01:24:45,240 --> 01:24:48,240
Mama used to tease me. She'd say, 
 "You don't belong to me.

2231
01:24:48,320 --> 01:24:51,720
You were left on the doorstep 
 by gypsies."

2232
01:24:51,800 --> 01:24:54,560
Sometimes I think it's true.

2233
01:24:54,680 --> 01:24:56,480
You're no gypsy, Fredo.

2234
01:24:58,040 --> 01:24:59,960
Mikey, I--

2235
01:25:00,080 --> 01:25:01,880
I was mad at you.

2236
01:25:08,840 --> 01:25:12,600
Why didn't we spend time 
 like this before?

2237
01:25:12,720 --> 01:25:15,000
You want a drink, right? 
 Waiter.

2238
01:25:22,520 --> 01:25:25,240
- How do you say banana daiquiri? 
 - Banana daiquiri.

2239
01:25:25,360 --> 01:25:27,520
- That's it? 
 - That's it.

2240
01:25:27,640 --> 01:25:30,400
- Uh, uno banana daiquiri. 
 - Banana daiquiri. Si, senor.

2241
01:25:30,520 --> 01:25:32,800
And, uh, a club soda.

2242
01:25:40,320 --> 01:25:43,000
Senator Geary's flying in 
 from Washington tomorrow night...

2243
01:25:43,120 --> 01:25:45,400
with some people, 
 some government people...

2244
01:25:45,520 --> 01:25:48,560
and I want you to show 'em 
 a good time in Havana.

2245
01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:53,120
It's my specialty, right?

2246
01:25:53,240 --> 01:25:56,240
- Can I trust you with something? 
 - Ofcourse, Mike.

2247
01:25:59,880 --> 01:26:03,120
In the evening, we're all invited 
 to the presidential palace...

2248
01:26:03,200 --> 01:26:05,680
a reception to bring in 
 the new year.

2249
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:07,600
After it's over...

2250
01:26:07,680 --> 01:26:10,120
they're gonna take me home 
 in a military car...

2251
01:26:10,200 --> 01:26:13,760
alone, for my protection...

2252
01:26:13,880 --> 01:26:17,120
and before I reach my hotel 
 I'll be assassinated.

2253
01:26:34,720 --> 01:26:37,680
- Who? 
 - Roth.

2254
01:26:43,240 --> 01:26:46,040
It was Roth who tried 
 to kill me in my home.

2255
01:26:47,760 --> 01:26:49,720
It was Roth all along.

2256
01:26:49,840 --> 01:26:54,840
He acts like I'm his son, 
 his successor...

2257
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:57,760
but he thinks he's gonna live 
 forever and he wants me out.

2258
01:27:02,680 --> 01:27:03,720
How can I help?

2259
01:27:03,800 --> 01:27:07,040
You just go along 
 as though you know nothing.

2260
01:27:07,160 --> 01:27:10,920
- I've already made my move. 
 - What move?

2261
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,400
Hyman Roth'll never see 
 the new year.

2262
01:27:30,040 --> 01:27:32,520
He says you have to take it easy 
 and he'll give you a prescription.

2263
01:27:32,600 --> 01:27:33,840
He'll be back tomorrow.

2264
01:27:33,920 --> 01:27:36,280
I want my own doctor. 
 Fly him in from Miami.

2265
01:27:36,360 --> 01:27:38,480
I don't trust a doctor 
 can't speak English.

2266
01:27:44,600 --> 01:27:46,400
Honey, go down to the casino.

2267
01:27:46,520 --> 01:27:49,760
- If you're sure you're better. 
 - Feel fine.

2268
01:27:51,640 --> 01:27:54,320
- Play the bingo game. 
 - Nice to see you, Mr. Paul.

2269
01:27:54,400 --> 01:27:56,280
-Just make yourself at home. 
 - Thank you.

2270
01:27:58,080 --> 01:27:59,440
My sixth sense tells me...

2271
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:01,960
your brother Fredo brought 
 a bag full of money.

2272
01:28:02,040 --> 01:28:05,080
Where is it?

2273
01:28:05,200 --> 01:28:07,520
You're pulling out?

2274
01:28:07,640 --> 01:28:11,360
Just wanna-- 
 I just wanna wait.

2275
01:28:14,600 --> 01:28:17,080
How do you feel?

2276
01:28:17,200 --> 01:28:19,280
Terrible. I'd give four million...

2277
01:28:19,400 --> 01:28:22,480
just to be able to take a piss 
 without it hurting.

2278
01:28:22,600 --> 01:28:25,760
Who had Frank Pentangeli killed?

2279
01:28:25,880 --> 01:28:28,120
The Rosato brothers.

2280
01:28:28,240 --> 01:28:31,640
I know. But who gave 
 the go-ahead?

2281
01:28:31,760 --> 01:28:34,520
I know I didn't.

2282
01:28:41,440 --> 01:28:43,880
There was this kid 
 I grew up with.

2283
01:28:43,960 --> 01:28:46,040
He was younger than me.

2284
01:28:46,160 --> 01:28:48,560
Sort of looked up to me, 
 you know.

2285
01:28:48,640 --> 01:28:52,080
We did our first work together.

2286
01:28:52,160 --> 01:28:54,160
Worked our way 
 out of the street.

2287
01:28:54,240 --> 01:28:56,160
Things were good. 
 We made the most of it.

2288
01:28:57,440 --> 01:28:59,840
During Prohibition...

2289
01:28:59,960 --> 01:29:01,840
we ran molasses into Canada.

2290
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:04,280
Made a fortune. Your father too.

2291
01:29:06,720 --> 01:29:09,640
As much as anyone...

2292
01:29:09,720 --> 01:29:12,160
I loved him and trusted him.

2293
01:29:15,080 --> 01:29:18,400
Later on he had an idea...

2294
01:29:18,520 --> 01:29:20,560
to build a city...

2295
01:29:20,680 --> 01:29:24,240
out of a desert stopover for G.I. s 
 on their way to the West Coast.

2296
01:29:26,200 --> 01:29:29,760
That kid's name was Moe Green...

2297
01:29:29,880 --> 01:29:32,960
and the city he invented 
 was Las Vegas.

2298
01:29:34,640 --> 01:29:36,960
This was a great man...

2299
01:29:37,080 --> 01:29:39,440
a man of vision and guts...

2300
01:29:39,560 --> 01:29:44,520
and there isn't even a plaque 
 or a signpost or a statue of him...

2301
01:29:44,600 --> 01:29:47,400
in that town.

2302
01:29:47,480 --> 01:29:50,800
Someone put a bullet 
 through his eye.

2303
01:29:52,120 --> 01:29:55,240
No one knows 
 who gave the order.

2304
01:29:55,320 --> 01:29:58,320
When I heard it I wasn't angry.

2305
01:29:58,440 --> 01:30:00,400
I knew Moe; 
 I knew he was headstrong.

2306
01:30:00,480 --> 01:30:04,240
Talking loud, 
 saying stupid things.

2307
01:30:04,320 --> 01:30:07,440
So when he turned up dead...

2308
01:30:07,520 --> 01:30:10,600
I let it go...

2309
01:30:10,680 --> 01:30:13,800
and I said to myself...

2310
01:30:13,880 --> 01:30:17,640
"This is the business 
 we've chosen."

2311
01:30:17,720 --> 01:30:20,400
I didn't ask...

2312
01:30:20,520 --> 01:30:22,360
who gave the order...

2313
01:30:22,440 --> 01:30:25,240
because it had nothing 
 to do with business.

2314
01:30:33,560 --> 01:30:37,280
That two million 
 in a bag in your room--

2315
01:30:40,120 --> 01:30:41,920
I'm going in...

2316
01:30:42,040 --> 01:30:44,000
to take a nap.

2317
01:30:44,120 --> 01:30:46,120
When I wake...

2318
01:30:46,200 --> 01:30:49,720
if the money's on the table 
 I'll know I have a partner.

2319
01:30:49,840 --> 01:30:52,120
If it isn't, 
 I'll know I don't.

2320
01:31:45,560 --> 01:31:47,600
All right, does everybody 
 know everybody here, huh?

2321
01:31:47,680 --> 01:31:49,560
- This is Senator Geary. 
 - How are you, Senator?

2322
01:31:49,680 --> 01:31:52,760
Good to see you, Mike. I'm glad 
 we could spend time together.

2323
01:31:52,880 --> 01:31:55,800
- Senator Payton from Florida. 
 - How you doing, Mike?

2324
01:31:55,920 --> 01:31:58,240
- And Judge DeMalco from New York. 
 - How do you do, sir?

2325
01:31:58,360 --> 01:32:00,400
- Fine, thank you. 
 - Senator Ream from Maryland.

2326
01:32:00,520 --> 01:32:03,680
- I've been looking forward to this. 
 - This is Fred Corngold from U.T.T.

2327
01:32:03,800 --> 01:32:07,120
- I know Fred. How are you? 
 - Fred does a mean cha-cha-cha.

2328
01:32:07,240 --> 01:32:10,560
- Oh, he does, huh? 
 - Gentlemen, it's refiill time.

2329
01:32:10,680 --> 01:32:15,000
Try some of them local drinks-- 
 uh, cuba libre, pina colada.

2330
01:32:15,120 --> 01:32:18,840
I think I'll try one of 
 those redheaded Yolandas.

2331
01:32:18,920 --> 01:32:22,680
- That you got. Congusto. 
 - Johnny.

2332
01:32:22,800 --> 01:32:26,280
You don't know my brother Fredo, 
 do you, Johnny? Johnny Ola, Fredo.

2333
01:32:26,360 --> 01:32:28,440
- We never met. Johnny Ola. 
 - Pleasure.

2334
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,200
Gentlemen, to a night in Havana.

2335
01:32:33,320 --> 01:32:35,160
- Happy New Year. 
 - Happy New Year.

2336
01:32:36,440 --> 01:32:38,960
- Happy New Year. 
 - That's right, huh?

2337
01:32:42,960 --> 01:32:46,160
- Checkin' in now. Right now. 
 - Never fear! Pat Geary's here!

2338
01:32:46,240 --> 01:32:48,960
- Hey, Fred. 
 - Cheers! Hey!

2339
01:32:49,080 --> 01:32:51,440
- Hey, Freddie, why are we standin'? 
 - Come on, man!

2340
01:32:51,560 --> 01:32:54,200
Everybody stands, 
 but it's worth it.

2341
01:32:54,320 --> 01:32:57,000
- You're not gonna believe this. 
 - I don't believe it already.

2342
01:32:57,080 --> 01:33:00,480
- That's right. Fifty dollars. 
 - You got a bet, mister.

2343
01:33:08,600 --> 01:33:10,960
That's him. That's Superman.

2344
01:33:42,280 --> 01:33:44,760
- Jesus Christ! 
 - Did I tell ya, or did I tell ya?

2345
01:33:46,480 --> 01:33:48,920
- I don't believe it. 
 - That thing's gotta be a fake.

2346
01:33:49,040 --> 01:33:52,760
That ain't no fake. That's real. 
 That's why they call him Superman.

2347
01:33:52,880 --> 01:33:56,720
Hey, Freddie. Freddie. 
 Where did you find this place?

2348
01:33:56,800 --> 01:33:59,080
Johnny Ola told me about 
 this place. He brought me here.

2349
01:33:59,160 --> 01:34:01,000
I didn't believe it, 
 but seein' is believin', huh?

2350
01:34:01,080 --> 01:34:04,400
- I see it and I don't believe it. 
 - Fifty bucks, Pat.

2351
01:34:04,520 --> 01:34:06,000
Old man Roth'd never come here...

2352
01:34:06,120 --> 01:34:08,880
but ol'Johnny knows these places 
 like the back of his hand.

2353
01:34:08,960 --> 01:34:11,440
Now watch him. He's gonna 
 break the cracker with it.

2354
01:34:11,560 --> 01:34:14,680
I wanna see him break a brick.

2355
01:34:14,800 --> 01:34:17,080
He could knock down a building.

2356
01:35:32,280 --> 01:35:35,360
Relax, Senor Roth. We're 
 taking you to the hospital.

2357
01:36:17,480 --> 01:36:19,760
And in my judgment 
 you'll continue to get those...

2358
01:36:19,880 --> 01:36:22,600
because I don't believe 
 that President Eisenhower...

2359
01:36:22,720 --> 01:36:24,120
will ever pull out of Cuba.

2360
01:36:24,200 --> 01:36:27,760
Not as long as we have over one billion 
 dollars invested in this country.

2361
01:36:30,880 --> 01:36:34,280
Now, the American public 
 believes in nonintervention.

2362
01:36:34,400 --> 01:36:37,160
Fredo. Where you goin'?

2363
01:36:37,280 --> 01:36:40,320
I'm gonna get me a real drink, 
 'cause I can't--

2364
01:37:34,080 --> 01:37:37,400
What kept Mr. Roth? 
 I understood he was coming.

2365
01:37:37,480 --> 01:37:40,880
Ream, what's the protocol? How long 
 should we stay around here?

2366
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:43,760
Oh, I don't know. I think 
 a half hour oughta do it.

2367
01:37:43,880 --> 01:37:46,240
Just long enough 
 to bring in the new year.

2368
01:39:16,880 --> 01:39:20,720
There's a plane waiting for us 
 to take us to Miami in an hour.

2369
01:39:20,840 --> 01:39:23,120
Don't make a big thing about it.

2370
01:39:27,040 --> 01:39:29,320
I know it was you, Fredo.

2371
01:39:29,440 --> 01:39:32,120
You broke my heart.

2372
01:39:32,200 --> 01:39:35,120
You broke my heart.

2373
01:41:12,160 --> 01:41:15,360
Fredo! Come on.

2374
01:41:15,480 --> 01:41:18,640
Come with me. It's the only 
 way out of here tonight.

2375
01:41:18,760 --> 01:41:21,240
Roth is dead. Fredo.

2376
01:41:21,320 --> 01:41:24,160
Fredo, come with me! 
 You're still my brother!

2377
01:41:24,240 --> 01:41:26,960
Fredo! Fredo!

2378
01:41:45,200 --> 01:41:46,960
U.S. passports only.

2379
01:41:49,600 --> 01:41:54,160
- U.S. passports only. 
 - I'm from the United States Senate.

2380
01:41:56,720 --> 01:41:58,960
- Back, please. 
 - Please! I must leave!

2381
01:43:04,560 --> 01:43:07,520
Al, get me a wet towel.

2382
01:43:14,280 --> 01:43:16,080
Kay know I'm back?

2383
01:43:20,680 --> 01:43:23,840
What about my boy? Did you get 
 him something for Christmas?

2384
01:43:23,960 --> 01:43:27,320
- I took care of it. 
 - What was it so I'll know?

2385
01:43:27,400 --> 01:43:30,720
It was a little car with an electric 
 motor that he could ride in.

2386
01:43:30,840 --> 01:43:32,680
It was nice.

2387
01:43:34,800 --> 01:43:37,520
Thank you, Al.

2388
01:43:37,640 --> 01:43:39,960
Fellas, could you step outside 
 for a minute, please?

2389
01:43:57,360 --> 01:43:59,200
Where's my brother?

2390
01:43:59,280 --> 01:44:03,080
Uh, Roth got out on a private boat. 
 He's in a hospital in Miami.

2391
01:44:03,160 --> 01:44:05,960
He had a stroke. 
 He recovered okay.

2392
01:44:06,080 --> 01:44:10,400
- Your bodyguard's dead. 
 - I asked about Fredo.

2393
01:44:10,480 --> 01:44:13,320
I think he got out. He must be 
 somewhere in New York.

2394
01:44:16,600 --> 01:44:19,000
All right.

2395
01:44:19,080 --> 01:44:21,880
I want you to get 
 in touch with him.

2396
01:44:21,960 --> 01:44:24,880
I know he's scared. 
 Tell him everything's all right.

2397
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:26,560
Tell him I know Roth misled him;

2398
01:44:26,680 --> 01:44:29,160
that he didn't know 
 they were gonna try to kill me.

2399
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:33,160
And they can come in now.

2400
01:44:33,280 --> 01:44:35,840
Oh, there was something else.

2401
01:44:35,960 --> 01:44:38,480
What?

2402
01:44:43,280 --> 01:44:45,160
What? 
 Come on. What?

2403
01:44:47,560 --> 01:44:49,600
Kay had a miscarriage. 
 She lost the baby.

2404
01:45:02,080 --> 01:45:04,360
- Was it a boy? 
 - After three and a half months--

2405
01:45:04,480 --> 01:45:08,560
Can't you give me a straight answer 
 anymore? Was it a boy?

2406
01:45:11,120 --> 01:45:12,960
I really don't know.

2407
01:49:32,400 --> 01:49:33,320
I take care of everything.

2408
01:51:11,200 --> 01:51:13,080
Vito, here's my $50.

2409
01:51:31,400 --> 01:51:35,200
I'll make an offer he don't refuse. 
 Don't worry.

2410
02:03:42,960 --> 02:03:45,720
From the year 1942 
 to the present time...

2411
02:03:45,800 --> 02:03:49,280
you were an employee 
 of the Genco Olive Oil Company?

2412
02:03:49,360 --> 02:03:50,880
That's right.

2413
02:03:51,920 --> 02:03:55,640
But in actuality you were a member 
 of the Corleone crime organization?

2414
02:03:58,760 --> 02:04:02,320
We called it the Corleone family, 
 Senator. We called it the family.

2415
02:04:02,440 --> 02:04:04,720
What was your position?

2416
02:04:05,800 --> 02:04:08,560
At first, like everybody else, 
 I was a soldier.

2417
02:04:08,680 --> 02:04:11,960
- What is that? 
 - A button. You know, come on.

2418
02:04:12,040 --> 02:04:14,240
No, I don't know. Tell me.

2419
02:04:15,880 --> 02:04:19,840
When the boss says "push a button 
 on a guy," I push a button.

2420
02:04:19,960 --> 02:04:22,360
- See, Senator? 
 - Mr. Questadt.

2421
02:04:22,440 --> 02:04:25,240
- You mean you killed people? 
 - What?

2422
02:04:25,320 --> 02:04:30,080
You killed people 
 at the behest of your superiors?

2423
02:04:33,840 --> 02:04:35,040
Yeah, that's right, counselor.

2424
02:04:35,120 --> 02:04:40,520
And the head of your family 
 is Michael Corleone?

2425
02:04:40,640 --> 02:04:43,560
Yeah, counselor, Michael Corleone, 
 right.

2426
02:04:43,680 --> 02:04:46,920
Did you ever get such an order 
 directly from Michael Corleone?

2427
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:50,080
No, I never talked to him.

2428
02:04:50,200 --> 02:04:53,840
Mr. Cicci, could you amplify 
 your answer a bit, please?

2429
02:04:53,960 --> 02:04:55,600
Do what?

2430
02:04:55,720 --> 02:04:59,840
Could you expand on your answer? 
 I'm interested in knowing...

2431
02:04:59,920 --> 02:05:02,200
was there always a buffer involved?

2432
02:05:03,080 --> 02:05:06,040
Someone in between you 
 and your possible superiors...

2433
02:05:06,120 --> 02:05:09,440
- who gave the actual orders? 
 - Yeah, right, a buffer.

2434
02:05:09,520 --> 02:05:12,560
The family had a lot of buffers.

2435
02:05:12,680 --> 02:05:14,640
Mr. Cicci, 
 you may find this very amusing...

2436
02:05:14,760 --> 02:05:17,600
but I promise you the members 
 of this committee do not.

2437
02:07:31,760 --> 02:07:34,960
If there's something I could do 
 for you, you come, we talk.

2438
02:12:47,120 --> 02:12:50,800
The rent stays like before.

2439
02:14:16,160 --> 02:14:20,880
Hey, what do you think? 
 God bless America. Big business.

2440
02:14:27,600 --> 02:14:30,880
- New York City. 
 - Would you mind speaking up?

2441
02:14:30,960 --> 02:14:32,840
New York City.

2442
02:14:32,920 --> 02:14:36,000
- Are you the son of Vito Corleone? 
 - Yes, I am.

2443
02:14:36,080 --> 02:14:39,960
- And where was he born? 
 - Corleone, Sicily.

2444
02:14:40,040 --> 02:14:42,160
Did he, at times, use an alias...

2445
02:14:42,280 --> 02:14:45,520
that was known in certain circles 
 as "Godfather"?

2446
02:14:46,400 --> 02:14:49,240
"Godfather" is a term 
 that was used by his friends...

2447
02:14:49,360 --> 02:14:53,080
one of affection, 
 one of respect.

2448
02:14:53,160 --> 02:14:57,440
Mr. Chairman, I would like 
 to verify the witness's statement.

2449
02:14:57,560 --> 02:15:00,000
For years now, a growing number 
 of my constituents...

2450
02:15:00,120 --> 02:15:02,560
have been of Italian descent...

2451
02:15:02,680 --> 02:15:04,560
and I've come to know them well.

2452
02:15:04,680 --> 02:15:09,600
They have honored me with their 
 support and with their friendship.

2453
02:15:09,720 --> 02:15:12,760
Indeed, I can proudly say 
 that some of my very best friends...

2454
02:15:12,840 --> 02:15:14,680
are Italian-Americans.

2455
02:15:15,640 --> 02:15:20,560
However, Mr. Chairman, at this time, 
 I have to leave these proceedings...

2456
02:15:20,680 --> 02:15:25,320
to preside over a very important 
 meeting of my own committee.

2457
02:15:25,440 --> 02:15:28,440
But before I leave, 
 I do want to say this--

2458
02:15:28,520 --> 02:15:32,880
that these hearings on the Mafia 
 are in no way whatsoever...

2459
02:15:33,000 --> 02:15:35,160
a slur upon 
 the great Italian people...

2460
02:15:35,240 --> 02:15:38,360
because I can state from 
 my own knowledge and experience...

2461
02:15:38,440 --> 02:15:41,960
that Italian-Americans are among 
 the most loyal...

2462
02:15:42,080 --> 02:15:44,280
most law-abiding, patriotic...

2463
02:15:44,360 --> 02:15:47,840
hard-working American citizens 
 in this land.

2464
02:15:47,960 --> 02:15:50,280
And it would be a shame, 
 Mr. Chairman...

2465
02:15:50,400 --> 02:15:52,480
if we allowed 
 a few rotten apples...

2466
02:15:52,560 --> 02:15:55,160
to give a bad name 
 to the whole barrel...

2467
02:15:55,240 --> 02:15:57,760
because from the time 
 of the great Christopher Columbus...

2468
02:15:57,840 --> 02:16:00,480
up to the time of Enrico Fermi...

2469
02:16:00,600 --> 02:16:02,520
right up until the present day...

2470
02:16:02,600 --> 02:16:04,440
Italian-Americans 
 have been pioneers...

2471
02:16:04,520 --> 02:16:06,640
in building and defending 
 our great nation.

2472
02:16:06,760 --> 02:16:08,880
They are the salt of the earth.

2473
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:11,760
They are one of the backbones 
 of this country.

2474
02:16:15,760 --> 02:16:18,120
The chairman is calling 
 the meeting back to order.

2475
02:16:18,200 --> 02:16:21,680
I'm sure we all agree 
 with our esteemed colleague.

2476
02:16:21,800 --> 02:16:25,560
Now, Mr. Corleone, you have been 
 advised as to your legal rights.

2477
02:16:25,640 --> 02:16:29,160
We have testimony from a witness, 
 a previous witness...

2478
02:16:29,280 --> 02:16:31,680
one Willi Cicci.

2479
02:16:31,800 --> 02:16:33,640
He has stated that you are head...

2480
02:16:33,720 --> 02:16:35,920
of the most powerful Mafia family 
 in this country.

2481
02:16:36,040 --> 02:16:38,800
- Are you? 
 - No, I'm not.

2482
02:16:38,920 --> 02:16:42,240
The witness has testified that 
 you are personally responsible...

2483
02:16:42,360 --> 02:16:45,840
for the murder of a New York City 
 police captain in 1947.

2484
02:16:45,960 --> 02:16:49,520
And with him, 
 a man named Virgil Solozzo.

2485
02:16:49,640 --> 02:16:51,800
- Do you deny this? 
 - Yes, I do.

2486
02:16:51,880 --> 02:16:55,040
Is it true that in the year 1950...

2487
02:16:55,120 --> 02:16:59,320
you devised a murder of the heads 
 of the so-called "five families"...

2488
02:16:59,400 --> 02:17:01,600
in New York, to assume 
 and consolidate...

2489
02:17:01,720 --> 02:17:04,040
your nefarious power?

2490
02:17:04,120 --> 02:17:07,800
- That's a complete falsehood. 
 - Is it true...

2491
02:17:07,880 --> 02:17:11,600
you have a controlling interest 
 in three major hotels in Las Vegas?

2492
02:17:12,840 --> 02:17:16,320
No, it is not true. I own some stock 
 in some of the hotels there...

2493
02:17:16,400 --> 02:17:18,400
but very little.

2494
02:17:20,480 --> 02:17:24,400
I also have stock in IBM and IT&T.

2495
02:17:24,520 --> 02:17:29,640
Do you have any interests or control 
 over gambling and narcotics...

2496
02:17:29,760 --> 02:17:31,160
in the state of New York?

2497
02:17:31,240 --> 02:17:33,120
No, I do not.

2498
02:17:33,200 --> 02:17:36,240
Senator, my client would like to 
 read a statement for this committee.

2499
02:17:36,360 --> 02:17:40,000
Mr. Chairman, 
 I think this statement...

2500
02:17:40,080 --> 02:17:42,200
is totally out of order 
 at this time.

2501
02:17:42,280 --> 02:17:45,920
Sir, my client has answered every 
 question asked by this committee...

2502
02:17:46,040 --> 02:17:47,720
with the utmost sincerity.

2503
02:17:47,840 --> 02:17:50,640
He did not take the Fifth Amendment, 
 as it was his right to do...

2504
02:17:50,760 --> 02:17:53,280
so in all fairness I think 
 the statement should be heard.

2505
02:17:55,480 --> 02:17:58,520
No, I'm going to allow Mr. Corleone 
 to read his statement.

2506
02:17:58,600 --> 02:17:59,960
I'll put it in the record.

2507
02:18:01,880 --> 02:18:04,880
"In the hopes of clearing 
 my family name...

2508
02:18:05,000 --> 02:18:07,440
and my sincere desire to give 
 my children their fair share...

2509
02:18:07,560 --> 02:18:09,520
of the American way of life 
 without a blemish...

2510
02:18:09,640 --> 02:18:11,840
on their name and background...

2511
02:18:11,960 --> 02:18:13,920
I have appeared 
 before this committee...

2512
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:16,800
and given it all the cooperation 
 in my power.

2513
02:18:18,120 --> 02:18:20,960
I consider it a great dishonor 
 to me personally...

2514
02:18:21,040 --> 02:18:23,360
to have to deny 
 that I am a criminal.

2515
02:18:24,240 --> 02:18:27,760
I wish to have the following 
 noted for the record:

2516
02:18:27,880 --> 02:18:31,720
that I served my country faithfully 
 and honorably in World War Two...

2517
02:18:31,840 --> 02:18:36,040
and was awarded a Navy Cross for 
 actions in defense of my country...

2518
02:18:37,560 --> 02:18:41,800
that I have never been arrested or 
 indicted for any crime whatsoever...

2519
02:18:41,880 --> 02:18:45,760
that no proof linking me to any 
 criminal conspiracy...

2520
02:18:45,880 --> 02:18:48,400
whether it is called "Mafia," 
 "Cosa Nostra"...

2521
02:18:48,520 --> 02:18:50,320
or whatever other name 
 you wish to give...

2522
02:18:50,440 --> 02:18:51,760
has ever been made public.

2523
02:18:53,000 --> 02:18:55,680
I have not taken refuge 
 behind the Fifth Amendment...

2524
02:18:55,800 --> 02:18:57,760
although it is my right to do so.

2525
02:19:00,680 --> 02:19:02,600
I challenge this committee...

2526
02:19:02,720 --> 02:19:06,040
to produce any witness 
 or evidence against me.

2527
02:19:06,120 --> 02:19:08,480
And if they do not...

2528
02:19:08,560 --> 02:19:11,880
I hope they will have the decency 
 to clear my name...

2529
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:15,160
with the same publicity with which 
 they now have besmirched it."

2530
02:19:16,760 --> 02:19:19,640
I'm sure we're allquite impressed, 
 Mr. Corleone...

2531
02:19:19,760 --> 02:19:22,120
particularly with your love 
 for our country.

2532
02:19:22,240 --> 02:19:24,800
Committee will stand in recess 
 until 10:00 a. m. Monday morning...

2533
02:19:24,920 --> 02:19:26,760
at which time the committee 
 will produce a witness...

2534
02:19:26,840 --> 02:19:29,440
who will corroborate the charges 
 which were made against you today...

2535
02:19:29,560 --> 02:19:32,440
and at which time, Mr. Corleone, 
 you may very well be subject...

2536
02:19:32,520 --> 02:19:34,520
to indictment for perjury.

2537
02:19:34,600 --> 02:19:36,640
I remind you that 
 you're still under subpoena.

2538
02:19:36,760 --> 02:19:38,560
Adjourned.

2539
02:19:42,600 --> 02:19:45,280
Ten-to-one shot, you said.

2540
02:19:45,400 --> 02:19:48,240
Ten-to-one shot 
 he would take the Fifth...

2541
02:19:48,360 --> 02:19:50,000
and I lose.

2542
02:19:50,120 --> 02:19:52,000
You sound like my bookie.

2543
02:19:52,120 --> 02:19:54,080
I owe that monkey my life.

2544
02:19:55,840 --> 02:19:57,760
Well, just get 
 a good night's sleep.

2545
02:19:57,880 --> 02:20:01,120
- Good night's sleep. 
 - Got a big day tomorrow.

2546
02:20:01,240 --> 02:20:04,040
Got you a new suit, 
 a new shirt, new tie.

2547
02:20:05,600 --> 02:20:07,880
I'm gonna shave you myself 
 in the morning.

2548
02:20:08,800 --> 02:20:12,600
You're gonna look respectable for 
 50 million of your fellow Americans.

2549
02:20:13,960 --> 02:20:18,680
My life won't be worth a nickel 
 after tomorrow.

2550
02:20:18,760 --> 02:20:22,040
Come on. 
 I saw this thing 19 times.

2551
02:20:23,360 --> 02:20:25,760
You got a great home here, Frankie.

2552
02:20:25,880 --> 02:20:29,680
The rest of your life, nobody gets 
 near you, you're not going anywhere.

2553
02:20:29,800 --> 02:20:32,880
That's great. 
 Beautiful.

2554
02:20:33,000 --> 02:20:34,880
Some deal I made.

2555
02:20:34,960 --> 02:20:37,600
You'll live like a king. 
 You'll be a hero.

2556
02:20:37,720 --> 02:20:40,640
You'll live better in here 
 than most people on the outside.

2557
02:20:40,760 --> 02:20:43,440
Some deal. 
 Jesus.

2558
02:20:45,160 --> 02:20:48,880
Alive. 
 Pentangeli is alive.

2559
02:20:50,680 --> 02:20:55,600
- How'd they get their hands on him? 
 - Roth. He engineered it.

2560
02:20:56,360 --> 02:20:58,680
Frankie went to make a deal 
 with the Rosato brothers...

2561
02:20:58,760 --> 02:21:00,800
and they tried to kill him.

2562
02:21:00,880 --> 02:21:02,720
He thought you double-crossed him.

2563
02:21:04,280 --> 02:21:06,440
Our people with the New York 
 detective said he was halfdead...

2564
02:21:06,560 --> 02:21:10,080
scared stiffand calling out loud 
 that you turned on him.

2565
02:21:10,200 --> 02:21:12,800
They already had him on possession, 
 bookmaking, murder one...

2566
02:21:12,920 --> 02:21:14,720
and a lot more.

2567
02:21:16,200 --> 02:21:18,760
The FBI has him airtight.

2568
02:21:18,880 --> 02:21:21,600
He's on an army base, 
 24-hour guards.

2569
02:21:21,720 --> 02:21:23,840
No way we can get to him.

2570
02:21:23,920 --> 02:21:26,760
You've opened yourself 
 to five counts of perjury.

2571
02:21:28,880 --> 02:21:31,720
What about Fredo? 
 What does he know?

2572
02:21:31,800 --> 02:21:34,400
He says he doesn't know anything, 
 and I believe him.

2573
02:21:35,280 --> 02:21:39,040
Roth-- he played this one 
 beautifully.

2574
02:21:46,840 --> 02:21:48,680
I want to talk to Fredo.

2575
02:22:26,760 --> 02:22:28,600
I haven't got a lot to say, Mike.

2576
02:22:31,040 --> 02:22:33,400
We have time.

2577
02:22:33,520 --> 02:22:36,320
I was kept pretty much in the dark.

2578
02:22:37,920 --> 02:22:39,720
I didn't know all that much.

2579
02:22:40,960 --> 02:22:45,240
What about now? Is there anything 
 you can help me out with?

2580
02:22:46,040 --> 02:22:47,840
Anything you can tell me now?

2581
02:22:50,120 --> 02:22:52,400
They got Pentangeli, 
 that's all I can tell you.

2582
02:23:06,720 --> 02:23:10,080
I didn't know 
 it was gonna be a hit, Mike.

2583
02:23:10,200 --> 02:23:12,400
I swear to God, 
 I didn't know it was gonna be a hit.

2584
02:23:15,320 --> 02:23:19,560
Johnny Ola bumped into me 
 in Beverly Hills...

2585
02:23:21,200 --> 02:23:23,520
and he said 
 that he wanted to talk.

2586
02:23:25,720 --> 02:23:28,360
He said that you and Roth...

2587
02:23:28,480 --> 02:23:31,720
were in on a big deal together...

2588
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:38,080
and that there was something in it 
 for me if I could help him out.

2589
02:23:38,160 --> 02:23:41,840
He said that you were being tough 
 on the negotiations.

2590
02:23:41,960 --> 02:23:46,160
But if they could get a little help 
 and close the deal fast...

2591
02:23:47,880 --> 02:23:50,000
it'd be good for the family.

2592
02:23:51,720 --> 02:23:53,680
You believed that story?

2593
02:23:53,800 --> 02:23:56,040
You believed that?

2594
02:23:56,160 --> 02:23:59,680
He said there was something in it 
 for me... on my own.

2595
02:23:59,760 --> 02:24:02,280
I've always taken care of you.

2596
02:24:02,400 --> 02:24:04,200
Taken care of me?

2597
02:24:05,280 --> 02:24:08,880
You're my kid brother. 
 You take care of me?

2598
02:24:09,000 --> 02:24:13,920
Did you ever think about that? 
 Did you ever once think about that?

2599
02:24:14,000 --> 02:24:17,280
Send Fredo off to do this, 
 send Fredo off to do that.

2600
02:24:18,640 --> 02:24:22,720
Let Fredo take care of some 
 Mickey Mouse nightclub somewhere.

2601
02:24:22,800 --> 02:24:25,600
Send Fredo to pick somebody up 
 at the airport.

2602
02:24:25,680 --> 02:24:28,840
I'm your older brother, Mike, 
 and I was stepped over!

2603
02:24:28,960 --> 02:24:33,520
- That's the way Pop wanted it. 
 - It ain't the way I wanted it!

2604
02:24:33,640 --> 02:24:36,000
I can handle things! 
 I'm smart!

2605
02:24:36,120 --> 02:24:39,920
Not like everybody says. 
 Like dumb. I'm smart...

2606
02:24:40,040 --> 02:24:42,000
and I want respect!

2607
02:24:49,600 --> 02:24:52,640
Is there anything you can tell me 
 about this investigation?

2608
02:24:52,720 --> 02:24:54,560
Anything more?

2609
02:25:02,280 --> 02:25:06,200
The Senate lawyer, Questadt...

2610
02:25:06,280 --> 02:25:07,800
he belongs to Roth.

2611
02:25:21,320 --> 02:25:23,320
You're nothing to me now.

2612
02:25:25,640 --> 02:25:27,760
You're not a brother, 
 you're not a friend.

2613
02:25:29,720 --> 02:25:32,400
I don't wanna know you 
 or what you do.

2614
02:25:33,520 --> 02:25:36,520
I don't wanna see you at the hotels.

2615
02:25:36,640 --> 02:25:38,920
I don't want you near my house.

2616
02:25:41,000 --> 02:25:43,720
When you see our mother, 
 I wanna know a day in advance...

2617
02:25:43,840 --> 02:25:45,240
so I won't be there.

2618
02:25:47,080 --> 02:25:49,720
You understand?

2619
02:26:06,120 --> 02:26:09,800
I don't want anything to happen 
 to him while my mother's alive.

2620
02:26:57,680 --> 02:27:01,160
There are more people 
 than a ball game in here.

2621
02:27:01,280 --> 02:27:03,080
There's Willi Cicci.

2622
02:27:24,240 --> 02:27:26,080
This committee will come to order.

2623
02:27:28,960 --> 02:27:31,520
- State your name, please. 
 - Frank Pentangeli.

2624
02:27:31,600 --> 02:27:35,160
- And where were you born? 
 - Partanego. Outside of Palermo.

2625
02:27:35,240 --> 02:27:37,400
Where do you live now?

2626
02:27:37,480 --> 02:27:41,720
I live in an army barracks 
 with the FBI guys.

2627
02:27:42,760 --> 02:27:47,720
We have here, finally, a witness 
 that will further testify...

2628
02:27:47,840 --> 02:27:50,400
to Michael Corleone's rule 
 over a criminal empire...

2629
02:27:50,520 --> 02:27:52,440
that controls all of the gambling 
 in this country...

2630
02:27:52,560 --> 02:27:53,920
and perhaps in other countries.

2631
02:27:54,000 --> 02:27:59,040
This witness had no buffer between 
 himself and Michael Corleone.

2632
02:27:59,160 --> 02:28:02,560
He can corroborate ourcharges on 
 enough counts for this committee...

2633
02:28:02,680 --> 02:28:06,880
to recommend a charge of perjury 
 against Michael Corleone.

2634
02:28:06,960 --> 02:28:08,600
- Senator. 
 - Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

2635
02:28:10,040 --> 02:28:11,200
Mr. Pentangeli.

2636
02:28:15,240 --> 02:28:18,240
Were you a member 
 of the Corleone family?

2637
02:28:18,360 --> 02:28:22,720
Did you serve under 
 caporegime Peter Clemenza...

2638
02:28:22,840 --> 02:28:27,320
under Vito Corleone, 
 also known as the "Godfather"?

2639
02:28:33,400 --> 02:28:35,440
I never knew no Godfather.

2640
02:28:38,120 --> 02:28:39,920
I have my own family, Senator.

2641
02:28:43,720 --> 02:28:47,840
Mr. Pentangeli, you are 
 contradicting a sworn statement...

2642
02:28:47,920 --> 02:28:49,760
you'd previously made to me 
 and signed.

2643
02:28:49,840 --> 02:28:53,280
I ask you again, sir, 
 here and now under oath...

2644
02:28:53,360 --> 02:28:57,720
were you at anytime 
 a memberof a crime organization...

2645
02:28:57,800 --> 02:28:59,160
headed by Michael Corleone?

2646
02:28:59,240 --> 02:29:02,800
I don't know nothing about that.

2647
02:29:05,760 --> 02:29:09,520
I was in the olive oil business 
 with his father...

2648
02:29:09,640 --> 02:29:11,920
but that was a long time ago, 
 that's all.

2649
02:29:13,000 --> 02:29:14,840
We have a sworn affidavit.

2650
02:29:16,280 --> 02:29:19,240
We have it-- 
 your sworn affidavit...

2651
02:29:19,360 --> 02:29:21,720
that you murdered on 
 the orders of Michael Corleone.

2652
02:29:21,840 --> 02:29:23,920
Do you deny that confession?

2653
02:29:24,040 --> 02:29:26,680
And do you realize what will happen 
 as a result of your denial?

2654
02:29:26,760 --> 02:29:29,760
Look, the FBI guys, 
 they promised me a deal...

2655
02:29:29,880 --> 02:29:33,440
so I made up a lot of stuff 
 about Michael Corleone...

2656
02:29:33,560 --> 02:29:35,440
'cause that's what they wanted.

2657
02:29:35,560 --> 02:29:39,200
But it was all lies-- 
 everything.

2658
02:29:40,120 --> 02:29:42,400
And they kept saying...

2659
02:29:42,480 --> 02:29:44,560
Michael Corleone did this...

2660
02:29:44,680 --> 02:29:47,120
and that Michael Corleone did that.

2661
02:29:48,520 --> 02:29:52,440
So I said,"Yeah, sure!"

2662
02:29:52,520 --> 02:29:56,000
Mr. Corleone, would you kindly 
 identify for the committee...

2663
02:29:56,080 --> 02:29:57,920
the gentleman sitting 
 to your left?

2664
02:29:58,000 --> 02:29:59,840
I can answer that.

2665
02:30:01,080 --> 02:30:03,960
His name is Vincenzo Pentangeli.

2666
02:30:04,040 --> 02:30:08,000
- Is he related to the witness? 
 - He is, I believe, his brother.

2667
02:30:08,080 --> 02:30:10,480
Will he come forward 
 and be sworn, sir?

2668
02:30:10,600 --> 02:30:13,160
Sir, this man 
 does not understand English.

2669
02:30:13,280 --> 02:30:16,760
He came at his own expense to aid 
 his brother in this time of trouble.

2670
02:30:16,840 --> 02:30:20,360
He's not under subpoena. 
 His reputation is impeccable.

2671
02:30:20,480 --> 02:30:22,240
Are you saying he knows nothing 
 about these matters?

2672
02:30:22,360 --> 02:30:23,680
To my knowledge, nothing.

2673
02:30:23,800 --> 02:30:26,640
I'm gonna find out 
 what the hell happened here.

2674
02:30:26,760 --> 02:30:28,640
Allright, this committee 
 is now adjourned.

2675
02:30:28,760 --> 02:30:30,880
- The witness is excused. 
 - Senator!

2676
02:30:33,160 --> 02:30:35,840
This committee owes an apology!

2677
02:30:35,960 --> 02:30:39,680
This committee owes an apology. 
 Apology, Senator.

2678
02:31:06,440 --> 02:31:09,920
- Michael, excuse me. 
 - Hold on a minute.

2679
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:12,600
The children are outside. 
 We're going.

2680
02:31:15,320 --> 02:31:17,520
What do you mean you're going? 
 We're all gonna leave tomorrow.

2681
02:31:21,960 --> 02:31:23,760
I'll be in my room.

2682
02:31:27,040 --> 02:31:29,880
Michael, I'm not going 
 back to Nevada.

2683
02:31:29,960 --> 02:31:32,760
I brought the children 
 to say good-bye to you.

2684
02:31:36,480 --> 02:31:38,520
I want you to know 
 I'm very happy for you.

2685
02:31:38,600 --> 02:31:41,040
I suppose I always knew 
 you were too smart...

2686
02:31:41,160 --> 02:31:43,000
to let any of them 
 ever beat you.

2687
02:31:44,800 --> 02:31:49,080
- Why don't you sit down? 
 - I'm not going to stay long.

2688
02:31:49,160 --> 02:31:51,480
There are some things 
 I'd like to talk to you about.

2689
02:31:53,160 --> 02:31:55,480
Some things that have been 
 on my mind.

2690
02:31:56,680 --> 02:32:00,640
- Changes I wanna make. 
 - I think it's too late for changes.

2691
02:32:02,080 --> 02:32:04,080
I promised myself 
 I wasn't going to say anything.

2692
02:32:04,200 --> 02:32:07,480
You're too late.

2693
02:32:11,720 --> 02:32:14,000
What really happened 
 with Pentangeli?

2694
02:32:20,040 --> 02:32:21,960
His brother came, helped him.

2695
02:32:22,080 --> 02:32:24,880
I didn't even know 
 he had a brother.

2696
02:32:25,000 --> 02:32:26,800
Where is he now?

2697
02:32:27,960 --> 02:32:30,280
He's on a plane back to Sicily.

2698
02:32:31,040 --> 02:32:33,360
All he had to do 
 was show his face.

2699
02:32:35,240 --> 02:32:39,600
It was between the brothers. 
 I had nothing to do with it.

2700
02:32:47,440 --> 02:32:52,320
Nobody is going-- 
 not you, not the kids! You hear me?

2701
02:32:52,440 --> 02:32:56,000
You're my wife, they're my children. 
 I love you. I won't allow it.

2702
02:32:57,040 --> 02:33:00,760
You say you love me, then you 
 talk about allowing me to leave!

2703
02:33:00,840 --> 02:33:03,800
Things have been going on for years 
 between men and women...

2704
02:33:03,880 --> 02:33:05,720
- that will not change. 
 - You've become blind!

2705
02:33:05,800 --> 02:33:08,600
- Blind to what? 
 - Look what happened to us.

2706
02:33:08,680 --> 02:33:11,640
- Look what's happened to our son! 
 - Nothing's happened--

2707
02:33:11,720 --> 02:33:14,760
- Anthony is fine! 
 - Anthony is not fine!

2708
02:33:14,880 --> 02:33:16,720
- I don't wanna hear about it! 
 - You will!

2709
02:33:16,840 --> 02:33:19,240
Anthony's not fine!

2710
02:33:19,360 --> 02:33:20,920
I don't wanna hear about it!

2711
02:33:21,800 --> 02:33:23,280
Over!

2712
02:33:35,880 --> 02:33:38,640
At this moment, 
 I feel no love for you at all.

2713
02:33:40,240 --> 02:33:42,560
I never thought 
 that would ever happen...

2714
02:33:43,760 --> 02:33:45,240
but it has.

2715
02:34:03,640 --> 02:34:05,240
We're gonna leave tomorrow.

2716
02:34:06,280 --> 02:34:09,120
Okay? Why don't you take the kids 
 back to their room?

2717
02:34:09,200 --> 02:34:11,040
You haven't heard me.

2718
02:34:12,520 --> 02:34:15,160
What do you want from me?

2719
02:34:15,240 --> 02:34:17,240
Do you expect me to let you go?

2720
02:34:17,360 --> 02:34:21,000
Do you expect me to let you take 
 my children from me?

2721
02:34:22,080 --> 02:34:24,960
Don't you know me? Don't you know 
 that that's an impossibility?

2722
02:34:25,080 --> 02:34:27,000
That that could never happen?

2723
02:34:27,120 --> 02:34:30,960
That I'd use all my power to keep 
 something like that from happening?

2724
02:34:31,880 --> 02:34:34,040
Don't you know that?

2725
02:34:40,560 --> 02:34:43,280
Now, in time...

2726
02:34:43,400 --> 02:34:44,800
you'll feel differently.

2727
02:34:46,440 --> 02:34:48,960
You'll be glad I stopped you now.

2728
02:34:51,040 --> 02:34:52,920
I know that.

2729
02:34:55,000 --> 02:34:57,760
I know you blame me 
 for losing the baby.

2730
02:34:59,880 --> 02:35:01,920
Yes.

2731
02:35:02,040 --> 02:35:04,320
I know what that meant to you.

2732
02:35:06,800 --> 02:35:09,600
I'll make it up to you.

2733
02:35:09,720 --> 02:35:11,520
I swear, I'll make it up to you.

2734
02:35:13,640 --> 02:35:15,480
I'm gonna change.

2735
02:35:16,680 --> 02:35:18,320
I'll change.

2736
02:35:18,440 --> 02:35:20,800
I've learned that I have 
 the strength to change.

2737
02:35:23,080 --> 02:35:25,360
And you'll forget about 
 this miscarriage...

2738
02:35:26,760 --> 02:35:28,240
and we'll have another child...

2739
02:35:28,360 --> 02:35:31,040
and we'll go on-- 
 you and I.

2740
02:35:32,520 --> 02:35:34,360
We'll go on.

2741
02:35:37,880 --> 02:35:39,840
You are blind.

2742
02:35:41,480 --> 02:35:43,800
It wasn't a miscarriage.

2743
02:35:45,760 --> 02:35:47,240
It was an abortion.

2744
02:35:48,960 --> 02:35:50,760
An abortion.

2745
02:35:51,640 --> 02:35:54,000
Just like our marriage 
 is an abortion.

2746
02:35:54,920 --> 02:35:57,920
Something that's unholy and evil.

2747
02:35:59,680 --> 02:36:02,680
I didn't want your son!

2748
02:36:02,760 --> 02:36:06,960
I wouldn't bring another one 
 of your sons into this world!

2749
02:36:08,280 --> 02:36:10,640
It was an abortion!

2750
02:36:10,760 --> 02:36:13,440
It was a son! A son! 
 And I had it killed...

2751
02:36:13,560 --> 02:36:16,240
because this must all end!

2752
02:36:17,800 --> 02:36:21,680
I know now that it's over. 
 I knew it then.

2753
02:36:22,920 --> 02:36:25,200
There would be no way...

2754
02:36:25,320 --> 02:36:28,160
no way you could ever forgive me...

2755
02:36:28,240 --> 02:36:30,520
not with this Sicilian thing...

2756
02:36:30,600 --> 02:36:32,760
that's been going on 
 for 2,000 years--

2757
02:36:32,840 --> 02:36:34,680
Bitch!

2758
02:36:40,160 --> 02:36:43,280
- You won't take my children. 
 - I will.

2759
02:36:43,400 --> 02:36:47,120
- You won't take my children! 
 - They're my children too.

2760
02:38:13,480 --> 02:38:16,760
Fredo, here's this for Grandma.

2761
02:38:26,000 --> 02:38:27,200
What are you doing?

2762
02:43:25,160 --> 02:43:26,960
Michael, say good-bye.

2763
02:44:41,320 --> 02:44:43,280
Can I speak with you 
 for a second?

2764
02:44:51,720 --> 02:44:55,640
- Where's Mike? 
 - Waiting foryou to leave.

2765
02:44:59,080 --> 02:45:00,920
Can I talk with him?

2766
02:45:01,000 --> 02:45:02,840
Sorry, no chance.

2767
02:45:03,760 --> 02:45:06,560
- Can I see him? 
 - He's in the boathouse.

2768
02:45:19,640 --> 02:45:21,440
Michael, it's Connie.

2769
02:45:46,640 --> 02:45:49,120
I'd like to stay close to home now, 
 if it's all right.

2770
02:45:58,040 --> 02:45:59,960
Is Kay coming?

2771
02:46:12,040 --> 02:46:14,880
Fredo's in the house with Mama.

2772
02:46:14,960 --> 02:46:18,720
He asked for you, 
 and Tom said you wouldn't see him.

2773
02:46:21,960 --> 02:46:23,800
That's right.

2774
02:46:26,280 --> 02:46:29,520
Kids, why don't you go outside 
 for a while?

2775
02:46:33,640 --> 02:46:35,640
Please, I wanna talk to you.

2776
02:46:47,040 --> 02:46:50,360
I hated you for so many years.

2777
02:46:50,440 --> 02:46:54,320
I think that I did things to myself, 
 to hurt myself...

2778
02:46:54,440 --> 02:46:56,240
so that you'd know...

2779
02:46:59,200 --> 02:47:01,000
that I could hurt you.

2780
02:47:07,160 --> 02:47:11,080
You were just being strong 
 for all of us the way Papa was.

2781
02:47:12,000 --> 02:47:13,800
And I forgive you.

2782
02:47:18,000 --> 02:47:20,840
Can't you forgive Fredo?

2783
02:47:20,960 --> 02:47:25,640
He's so sweet 
 and helpless without you.

2784
02:47:31,560 --> 02:47:34,960
You need me. 
 I want to take care ofyou now.

2785
02:49:25,640 --> 02:49:27,000
Sit down.

2786
02:49:37,920 --> 02:49:40,960
Our friend and business partner, 
 Hyman Roth, is in the news.

2787
02:49:42,760 --> 02:49:44,840
You hear about it?

2788
02:49:44,960 --> 02:49:46,760
I hear that he's in Israel.

2789
02:49:47,840 --> 02:49:50,120
And the High Court in Israel 
 turned down his request...

2790
02:49:50,240 --> 02:49:52,320
to live there as a returned Jew.

2791
02:49:52,440 --> 02:49:56,240
His passport's been invalidated, 
 except for return to the US.

2792
02:49:56,360 --> 02:49:58,720
He landed in Buenos Aires yesterday.

2793
02:49:58,840 --> 02:50:01,680
He offered a gift of a million 
 dollars if they let him live there.

2794
02:50:03,560 --> 02:50:05,360
They turned him down.

2795
02:50:05,480 --> 02:50:09,560
- He's gonna try Panama. 
 - Panama won't take him.

2796
02:50:09,640 --> 02:50:12,040
Not for a million, 
 not for ten million.

2797
02:50:12,160 --> 02:50:13,960
His medical condition 
 is reported as terminal.

2798
02:50:14,080 --> 02:50:16,880
He's only gonna live 
 another six months anyway.

2799
02:50:17,000 --> 02:50:19,920
He's been dying of 
 the same heart attack for 20 years.

2800
02:50:20,040 --> 02:50:24,960
- That plane goes to Miami. 
 - Right. That's where I want it met.

2801
02:50:25,080 --> 02:50:28,160
Mike, that's impossible. 
 They'll turn him over directly...

2802
02:50:28,240 --> 02:50:30,360
to the Internal Revenue, Customs 
 and half the FBl.

2803
02:50:30,440 --> 02:50:33,560
It's not impossible. 
 Nothing's impossible.

2804
02:50:33,640 --> 02:50:35,920
It would be like trying to kill 
 the president. No way to get to him.

2805
02:50:37,200 --> 02:50:39,040
You know, you surprise me.

2806
02:50:42,120 --> 02:50:45,600
If anything in this life 
 is certain--

2807
02:50:45,720 --> 02:50:47,880
if history's taught us anything...

2808
02:50:48,760 --> 02:50:51,280
it's that you can kill anyone.

2809
02:50:58,320 --> 02:51:01,240
Difficult, not impossible.

2810
02:51:01,320 --> 02:51:03,520
Good.

2811
02:51:05,640 --> 02:51:08,760
Why did you ask me if something 
 was wrong when I came in?

2812
02:51:12,200 --> 02:51:16,040
I thought you were 
 gonna tell me that...

2813
02:51:16,160 --> 02:51:17,960
you were moving 
 your family to Vegas.

2814
02:51:19,680 --> 02:51:25,080
And that you'd been offered the 
 vice presidency of the hotels there.

2815
02:51:25,160 --> 02:51:27,120
- I thought you'd tell me that. 
 - I turned them down.

2816
02:51:27,240 --> 02:51:28,880
Do I have to tell you 
 about every offer that I turn down?

2817
02:51:33,880 --> 02:51:34,960
Let's do business.

2818
02:51:35,080 --> 02:51:37,360
All right.

2819
02:51:38,360 --> 02:51:40,320
Just consider this. 
 Just consider it.

2820
02:51:42,320 --> 02:51:43,920
Now, Roth and the Rosatos 
 are on the run.

2821
02:51:44,040 --> 02:51:46,880
Are they worth it, 
 and are they strong enough?

2822
02:51:46,960 --> 02:51:50,640
Is it worth it? 
 I mean, you won.

2823
02:51:50,760 --> 02:51:52,560
Do you want to wipe 
 everybody out?

2824
02:51:52,680 --> 02:51:55,520
I don't feel I have to wipe 
 everybody out--

2825
02:51:55,600 --> 02:51:58,600
just my enemies, that's all.

2826
02:52:04,600 --> 02:52:07,200
You gonna come along with me on 
 these things I have to do or what?

2827
02:52:09,520 --> 02:52:13,840
'Cause if not, you can take your 
 wife, family and your mistress...

2828
02:52:13,920 --> 02:52:16,240
move them all to Las Vegas.

2829
02:52:20,720 --> 02:52:25,360
Why do you hurt me? I've always been 
 loyal to you. I mean, what is this?

2830
02:52:38,560 --> 02:52:40,400
What is it that you want me to do?

2831
02:52:43,600 --> 02:52:47,480
How would you like it if I taught 
 you how to catch really big fish?

2832
02:52:47,600 --> 02:52:50,280
- Would you like that? 
 - Okay.

2833
02:52:50,400 --> 02:52:53,120
You know, when I was your age...

2834
02:52:53,240 --> 02:52:56,480
I went out fishing 
 with all my brothers...

2835
02:52:56,600 --> 02:52:58,880
and my father...

2836
02:52:59,000 --> 02:53:00,920
everybody...

2837
02:53:01,040 --> 02:53:03,840
and I was the only one 
 that caught a fish.

2838
02:53:05,240 --> 02:53:07,520
Nobody else could catch one, 
 except me.

2839
02:53:07,600 --> 02:53:09,440
You know how I did it?

2840
02:53:10,920 --> 02:53:14,360
Every time I put the line 
 in the water, I said a Hail Mary.

2841
02:53:14,440 --> 02:53:17,240
And every time I said a Hail Mary, 
 I caught a fish.

2842
02:53:20,480 --> 02:53:22,800
You believe that? 
 It's true.

2843
02:53:22,920 --> 02:53:24,720
That's the secret.

2844
02:53:26,280 --> 02:53:28,960
Wanna try it 
 when we go on the lake?

2845
02:53:29,080 --> 02:53:33,040
Okay. 
 What else you got?

2846
02:53:58,560 --> 02:54:01,000
Things are gonna be okay, Frankie. 
 Don't worry.

2847
02:54:01,120 --> 02:54:04,880
- Did my brother go back? 
 - Yeah. Don't worry.

2848
02:54:05,000 --> 02:54:07,920
He's ten times tougher than me-- 
 my brother.

2849
02:54:08,040 --> 02:54:10,720
He's old-fashioned.

2850
02:54:10,840 --> 02:54:13,880
He didn't wanna go out to dinner. 
 He just wanted to go straight home.

2851
02:54:13,960 --> 02:54:15,840
That's my brother. 
 There's nothing...

2852
02:54:15,920 --> 02:54:18,840
that could get him away 
 from that two-meal town.

2853
02:54:18,960 --> 02:54:21,760
He could've been big here, 
 could've had his own family.

2854
02:54:30,200 --> 02:54:32,000
What do I do now?

2855
02:54:39,840 --> 02:54:42,600
You were always interested 
 in politics and history.

2856
02:54:45,120 --> 02:54:48,360
I remember you talking about Hitler 
 back in '33.

2857
02:54:48,480 --> 02:54:51,720
I still read a lot. 
 I get good stuff in there.

2858
02:54:54,520 --> 02:54:56,800
You were around the old-timers...

2859
02:54:56,920 --> 02:55:00,000
agreeing about how the family's 
 should be organized...

2860
02:55:00,080 --> 02:55:02,960
based on the old home allegiance 
 and called them regimes--

2861
02:55:03,040 --> 02:55:05,360
capos and soldiers.

2862
02:55:06,480 --> 02:55:08,320
And it worked.

2863
02:55:08,440 --> 02:55:10,840
Yeah, it worked.

2864
02:55:10,960 --> 02:55:14,440
Those were the great old days, 
 you know?

2865
02:55:14,560 --> 02:55:17,480
And we was like the Roman Empire.

2866
02:55:17,600 --> 02:55:20,840
The Corleone family 
 was like the Roman Empire.

2867
02:55:25,200 --> 02:55:27,040
It was once.

2868
02:55:43,480 --> 02:55:47,880
When a plot 
 against the emperor failed...

2869
02:55:48,000 --> 02:55:50,520
the plotters were always given 
 a chance...

2870
02:55:53,160 --> 02:55:55,480
to let the families 
 keep their fortunes.

2871
02:55:56,520 --> 02:55:58,640
Yeah, but only the rich guys.

2872
02:55:58,720 --> 02:56:00,840
The little guys, 
 they got knocked off...

2873
02:56:00,960 --> 02:56:03,560
and all their estates 
 went to the emperors...

2874
02:56:03,680 --> 02:56:06,520
unless they went home 
 and killed themselves.

2875
02:56:06,600 --> 02:56:08,440
Then nothing happened to them.

2876
02:56:09,840 --> 02:56:13,600
And their families 
 were taken care of.

2877
02:56:15,640 --> 02:56:19,200
That was a good break. 
 Nice deal.

2878
02:56:19,320 --> 02:56:20,640
Yeah.

2879
02:56:21,720 --> 02:56:23,520
They went home...

2880
02:56:24,840 --> 02:56:27,840
and sat in a hot bath...

2881
02:56:27,960 --> 02:56:30,360
opened up their veins...

2882
02:56:30,440 --> 02:56:32,760
and bled to death.

2883
02:56:34,240 --> 02:56:37,040
And sometimes they had 
 a little party before they did it.

2884
02:56:43,200 --> 02:56:45,760
Don't worry about anything.

2885
02:56:46,760 --> 02:56:49,560
Thanks, Tom. Thanks.

2886
02:57:07,520 --> 02:57:09,000
See you, Tom.

2887
02:57:22,080 --> 02:57:24,640
You have to go.

2888
02:57:25,800 --> 02:57:28,560
- So pretty. 
 - Please hurry. He's coming.

2889
02:57:30,920 --> 02:57:33,720
Go rest.

2890
02:57:39,680 --> 02:57:41,520
Kiss Mama good-bye.

2891
02:57:44,160 --> 02:57:46,200
Will you kiss your mother good-bye?

2892
02:57:46,280 --> 02:57:48,120
Say good-bye to Mama.

2893
02:57:49,520 --> 02:57:51,360
I love you.

2894
02:57:53,080 --> 02:57:54,400
Please.

2895
02:58:12,640 --> 02:58:14,120
Come here.

2896
02:58:23,520 --> 02:58:25,480
Please, kiss me once.

2897
03:00:01,120 --> 03:00:03,160
Easy.

2898
03:00:11,560 --> 03:00:14,240
He's here! 
 We're going fishing!

2899
03:00:14,320 --> 03:00:16,880
Michael wants to take him 
 to Reno now!

2900
03:00:16,960 --> 03:00:18,960
Oh, shit.

2901
03:00:20,960 --> 03:00:23,760
Okay, kid, you gotta go to Reno 
 with your pop.

2902
03:00:25,240 --> 03:00:27,920
Come on, I'll take you 
 fishing tomorrow, okay?

2903
03:00:28,040 --> 03:00:29,360
Okay.

2904
03:00:31,680 --> 03:00:34,080
Attaboy. 
 Hey, Anthony.

2905
03:00:34,160 --> 03:00:38,440
Listen. I'll catch one for you 
 in secret, huh? All right?

2906
03:00:38,560 --> 03:00:40,360
Okay, go ahead.

2907
03:00:41,280 --> 03:00:42,280
Okay, let's go.

2908
03:01:20,920 --> 03:01:23,200
Mr. Roth, you understand 
 I'll have to take you into custody?

2909
03:01:23,320 --> 03:01:25,120
Yes, I understand.

2910
03:01:25,240 --> 03:01:28,040
Can you give us your reaction to 
 the High Court of Israel's ruling?

2911
03:01:28,160 --> 03:01:31,000
I'm a retired investor 
 on a pension.

2912
03:01:31,080 --> 03:01:34,320
I went to Israel because I wished 
 to live there as Jew...

2913
03:01:34,400 --> 03:01:35,920
in the twilight of my life.

2914
03:01:42,080 --> 03:01:44,840
Hey, Frankie, come on out! 
 Let's play some hearts!

2915
03:02:09,960 --> 03:02:12,680
Is it true you're worth 
 over $300 million, Mr. Roth?

2916
03:02:12,800 --> 03:02:16,520
I'm a retired investor 
 living on a pension.

2917
03:02:16,640 --> 03:02:20,160
I came home to vote 
 in the presidential election...

2918
03:02:20,280 --> 03:02:23,320
because they wouldn't give me 
 an absentee ballot.

2919
03:02:35,320 --> 03:02:37,680
Jesus Christ.

2920
03:02:37,800 --> 03:02:41,760
Hail Mary, full of grace...

2921
03:02:41,880 --> 03:02:44,480
the Lord is with thee.

2922
03:02:44,600 --> 03:02:47,760
Blessed are thou amongst women.

2923
03:02:47,840 --> 03:02:50,640
Blessed is the fruit of thy womb, 
 Jesus.

2924
03:02:52,200 --> 03:02:55,800
Holy Mary, Mother of God, 
 pray for us sinners.

2925
03:03:36,040 --> 03:03:39,680
Hey, everybody, 
 come on, pay attention. Come here.

2926
03:03:39,760 --> 03:03:42,760
This is my friend, Carlo Rizzi. 
 My brother, Fredo.

2927
03:03:42,880 --> 03:03:44,520
- You know Fredo. 
 - Sure.

2928
03:03:44,640 --> 03:03:49,160
Here's my stepbrother, Tom. 
 That's his girl, Theresa.

2929
03:03:49,280 --> 03:03:52,320
This cute little thing over here's 
 my sister Connie I told you about.

2930
03:03:52,440 --> 03:03:55,120
Come on, say hello to Carlo. 
 He's good-looking, ain't he?

2931
03:03:55,200 --> 03:03:56,960
Yes.

2932
03:03:57,040 --> 03:03:59,520
Oh, that droopy thing over there, 
 that's my brother, Mike.

2933
03:03:59,640 --> 03:04:02,240
We call him Joe Collar, you know 
 what I mean? Go on, sit down.

2934
03:04:02,360 --> 03:04:05,440
- Go ahead. Talk to each other. 
 - Sit down.

2935
03:04:05,560 --> 03:04:07,360
Hey, Mr. Einstein.

2936
03:04:10,560 --> 03:04:13,320
- Here's the cake. 
 - Hey, get in here.

2937
03:04:15,880 --> 03:04:18,680
- Where's your father? 
 - On a wild goose chase.

2938
03:04:18,760 --> 03:04:21,080
- Here. 
 - Let's see that thing.

2939
03:04:22,400 --> 03:04:24,960
- Oh, honey, that's nice. 
 - That's beautiful.

2940
03:04:25,040 --> 03:04:27,480
- Should I put the candles on now? 
 - Go on. You help her, all right?

2941
03:04:27,560 --> 03:04:28,920
Sure.

2942
03:04:30,040 --> 03:04:32,520
- What is that, rum? 
 - Yeah.

2943
03:04:37,920 --> 03:04:41,120
Sonny, come on, don't touch 
 the antipasto till Pop sees it.

2944
03:04:48,800 --> 03:04:52,120
What do you think, the nerve of them 
 Japs, them slanty-eyed bastards?

2945
03:04:52,240 --> 03:04:54,440
Dropping bombs on our own backyard. 
 On Pop's birthday, you know?

2946
03:04:54,560 --> 03:04:57,840
They didn't know 
 it was Pop's birthday.

2947
03:04:57,920 --> 03:05:00,560
Well, we should've expected it 
 after the oil embargo.

2948
03:05:00,640 --> 03:05:03,160
What do you mean, expected it? 
 They got no right dropping bombs.

2949
03:05:03,280 --> 03:05:05,360
What are you, a Jap lover? 
 You on their side?

2950
03:05:05,440 --> 03:05:07,360
I understand 30,000 men enlisted 
 this morning.

2951
03:05:07,440 --> 03:05:10,000
- Bunch of saps. 
 - Why are they saps?

2952
03:05:10,080 --> 03:05:12,360
Come on, do we even have to talk 
 about the war?

2953
03:05:12,480 --> 03:05:14,160
You talk to Carlo, all right?

2954
03:05:16,360 --> 03:05:20,240
They're saps because 
 they risk their lives for strangers.

2955
03:05:20,320 --> 03:05:24,000
- That's Pop talking. 
 - You're goddamn right.

2956
03:05:24,080 --> 03:05:25,560
They risk their lives 
 for their country.

2957
03:05:25,640 --> 03:05:27,280
Country ain't your blood. 
 You remember that.

2958
03:05:27,360 --> 03:05:29,520
- I don't feel that way. 
 - "I don't feel that way."

2959
03:05:29,600 --> 03:05:32,920
If you don't feel like that, 
 quit college and join the army.

2960
03:05:33,040 --> 03:05:34,440
I did.

2961
03:05:35,520 --> 03:05:37,200
I enlisted in the Marines.

2962
03:05:40,720 --> 03:05:43,840
- Mike, why didn't you come to us? 
 - What do you mean?

2963
03:05:43,920 --> 03:05:46,960
Pop had to pull a lot of strings 
 to get you a deferment.

2964
03:05:47,040 --> 03:05:48,080
I didn't ask for it.

2965
03:05:48,160 --> 03:05:50,200
I didn't ask for a deferment. 
 I didn't want it.

2966
03:05:51,880 --> 03:05:54,280
Come on, knock it off! Come on!

2967
03:05:54,400 --> 03:05:56,280
Punk.

2968
03:05:56,400 --> 03:05:58,000
- Go on. 
 - Sit down.

2969
03:06:00,760 --> 03:06:03,840
Mommy, Daddy's fighting again!

2970
03:06:07,440 --> 03:06:09,280
Go show Carlo the tree.

2971
03:06:19,520 --> 03:06:20,840
Nice.

2972
03:06:25,240 --> 03:06:28,000
Break your father's heart 
 on his birthday.

2973
03:06:28,760 --> 03:06:31,360
That's swell. Congratulations.

2974
03:06:31,440 --> 03:06:34,960
That's right, encourage him. 
 Go on, get me a drink.

2975
03:06:35,800 --> 03:06:37,880
Go on.

2976
03:06:40,320 --> 03:06:43,320
I don't understand. 
 Your father has plans for you.

2977
03:06:43,400 --> 03:06:47,400
Many times, he and I have talked 
 about your future.

2978
03:06:49,240 --> 03:06:50,920
You talked to my father 
 about my future?

2979
03:06:54,080 --> 03:06:57,880
- My future? 
 - He has high hopes for you.

2980
03:06:57,960 --> 03:07:00,000
I have my own plans 
 for my future.

2981
03:07:00,920 --> 03:07:03,480
Did you go to college to get stupid? 
 You're really stupid.

2982
03:07:03,560 --> 03:07:05,400
He's here, come on!

2983
03:07:07,600 --> 03:07:09,760
Come on.

2984
03:07:11,560 --> 03:07:12,920
Stupid.

2985
03:07:29,240 --> 03:07:32,760
Surprise!

2986
03:07:32,840 --> 03:07:36,960
For he's a jolly good fellow 
 For he's a jolly good fellow

2987
03:07:37,040 --> 03:07:40,440
For he's a jolly good fellow

2988
03:07:40,560 --> 03:07:42,560
Which nobody can deny
