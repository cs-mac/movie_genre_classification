1
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,005
My name is Alice.

2
00:03:51,775 --> 00:03:54,350
I worked for the Umbrella Corporation,
in a secret laboratory

3
00:03:54,351 --> 00:03:56,840
developing experimental bio weaponry

4
00:03:57,471 --> 00:04:00,061
There was an incident, a virus escaped.

5
00:04:00,441 --> 00:04:01,611
Everybody died.

6
00:04:03,236 --> 00:04:04,501
trouble was...

7
00:04:05,321 --> 00:04:06,696
There didn't stay dead.

8
00:04:07,657 --> 00:04:10,937
This was the start of an apocalypse
that would sweep the entire world

9
00:04:11,327 --> 00:04:14,222
The men responsible for this disaster took
refuge underground

10
00:04:14,697 --> 00:04:17,182
And continued to experiment
with the deadly T-Virus.

11
00:04:18,042 --> 00:04:20,052
They felt secure in their high tech fortress.

12
00:04:21,613 --> 00:04:22,886
But they were wrong.

13
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:48,165
Bio hazard.
{Speaking Japanese}

14
00:06:16,359 --> 00:06:17,374
Mr General?

15
00:06:18,254 --> 00:06:19,654
- Report.
- Sir.

16
00:06:20,219 --> 00:06:23,729
A half hour ago we began
lose contact with parameter sentries.

17
00:06:24,539 --> 00:06:25,719
How many have we lost?

18
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,760
- All of them.
- And you waited 30 minutes to tell me?

19
00:06:29,975 --> 00:06:33,195
We thought it was a communications problem.
I didn't want to disturb you.

20
00:06:33,786 --> 00:06:35,296
Give me the surface gate.
Hai!

21
00:06:39,835 --> 00:06:42,055
- This is General Wesker.
- Sir.

22
00:06:42,386 --> 00:06:45,036
- Report your situation.
- Everything is quiet here.

23
00:06:45,302 --> 00:06:46,592
No sign of intruders?

24
00:06:48,791 --> 00:06:50,776
Hotaka...we have movement!
Multiples targets

25
00:06:54,392 --> 00:06:56,207
Surface gate,
Identify targets.

26
00:06:56,562 --> 00:06:58,287
repeat...identify targets.

27
00:06:58,353 --> 00:07:02,467
- Sir, elevator 2 is moving.
- I want security at that main entrance now!

28
00:09:33,647 --> 00:09:34,827
Hey, boys...

29
00:09:36,157 --> 00:09:38,492
Is that any way to treat a lady?

30
00:09:53,484 --> 00:09:56,569
Tell security to flood the main entrance
with Nano-Gas.

31
00:09:58,519 --> 00:09:59,469
Sir...?

32
00:10:00,004 --> 00:10:01,424
Our men are still out there!

33
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:07,460
Any more questions?

34
00:10:09,345 --> 00:10:12,545
Intruders in sectors 1 thru 5
7 and 8.

35
00:10:12,547 --> 00:10:14,871
Reports of gun fire in
sectors 10 and 11.

36
00:10:18,161 --> 00:10:19,491
Stay at your stations!

37
00:10:20,181 --> 00:10:22,706
All security protocols
are now in full effect.

38
00:10:22,961 --> 00:10:26,461
Lock down all elevators
Seal all internal blast doors

39
00:10:27,637 --> 00:10:29,487
And I want damage reports.

40
00:12:34,789 --> 00:12:37,184
Intruder Alert

41
00:13:47,981 --> 00:13:49,380
Purge Facility.
Authorization.

42
00:13:49,381 --> 00:13:50,561
Countdown Started.

43
00:13:53,981 --> 00:13:58,281
- Run. Move! Go! Go! Go!
- Out! Everybody move out!

44
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:10,783
{Computer Voice}
Turbulence. Turbulence. Turbulence.

45
00:14:14,778 --> 00:14:16,123
{Computer Voice}
Turbulence. Turbulence.

46
00:14:29,944 --> 00:14:31,064
{Computer Voice}
Turbulence. Turb...

47
00:14:47,546 --> 00:14:48,681
Any last words?

48
00:15:01,728 --> 00:15:04,028
How nice to finally
meet the real you.

49
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:07,203
Hurts...doesn't it?

50
00:15:07,858 --> 00:15:10,253
Well, it's just the start
of the bad news.

51
00:15:10,963 --> 00:15:12,553
All those powers of yours...

52
00:15:13,113 --> 00:15:15,354
Speed ...Strength...

53
00:15:15,739 --> 00:15:19,249
Accelerated healing...
Well, you can kiss all those goodbye.

54
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,601
- What have you done?
- The Serum I've injected you with

55
00:15:22,602 --> 00:15:25,280
is neutralizing the T-cells within your body.

56
00:15:25,865 --> 00:15:30,600
Put simply...The Umbrella Corporation
is taking back its property.

57
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:33,320
You just didn't work out.

58
00:15:33,975 --> 00:15:35,240
So, you are being withdrawn

59
00:15:50,292 --> 00:15:53,797
I am what you used to be...
Only better.

60
00:15:54,407 --> 00:15:55,492
Please wait.

61
00:15:55,942 --> 00:15:57,042
Last words?

62
00:15:58,507 --> 00:16:00,657
- Thank you.
- For killing you?

63
00:16:01,828 --> 00:16:03,603
For making me human again.

64
00:16:06,144 --> 00:16:09,074
{Computer Voice}
Pull up...Terrian...Terrian... Pull up...Terrian...Terrian...

65
00:17:12,999 --> 00:17:15,804
This is Arcadia, broadcasting on
the emergency frequency.

66
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,950
There is no infection. We offer safety
and security...food and shelter.

67
00:17:22,501 --> 00:17:25,190
This is Arcadia, broadcasting on
the emergency frequency.

68
00:17:25,486 --> 00:17:26,731
There is no infection...

69
00:17:28,551 --> 00:17:30,151
Well I took revenge on Umbrella,

70
00:17:30,551 --> 00:17:32,952
The last handful of survivors
took a chopper to safety.

71
00:17:33,961 --> 00:17:36,341
They were Headed for a town in
Alaska called Arcadia.

72
00:17:37,352 --> 00:17:39,282
We had received radio transmissions from there

73
00:17:39,803 --> 00:17:42,438
They offered food and shelter,
safety and security ...

74
00:17:42,778 --> 00:17:43,703
A Haven.

75
00:17:44,182 --> 00:17:45,397
Free of infection.

76
00:17:58,998 --> 00:18:01,053
May 3, 16:00 hours

77
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:04,024
177 days without signs of life.

78
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,360
I'm at, uh...

79
00:18:06,734 --> 00:18:11,629
58.37 degrees North, 134.58 degrees West.

80
00:18:12,645 --> 00:18:14,740
Closing on coordinates
for Arcadia

81
00:18:15,205 --> 00:18:16,920
But no signs appear on any map.

82
00:18:19,271 --> 00:18:20,806
I hope Claire & the others made it.

83
00:20:44,369 --> 00:20:45,819
You're not coming?

84
00:20:46,434 --> 00:20:47,819
Take care of the others.

85
00:20:48,569 --> 00:20:49,854
Good luck, K-Mart.

86
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:53,220
Claire...

87
00:21:27,873 --> 00:21:28,793
May 3

88
00:21:29,438 --> 00:21:30,728
19:30 hours

89
00:21:31,369 --> 00:21:32,489
Arcadia.

90
00:21:33,449 --> 00:21:35,354
If such a place exists.

91
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:37,560
Just an empty field...

92
00:21:38,824 --> 00:21:39,864
And a beach.

93
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:44,455
We all heard the transmissions.

94
00:21:45,325 --> 00:21:46,760
Someone must've sent them.

95
00:21:47,475 --> 00:21:48,755
Someone must have...

96
00:21:49,276 --> 00:21:51,091
Why aren't all these people here?

97
00:21:53,225 --> 00:21:54,435
Or why...

98
00:21:56,001 --> 00:21:57,326
Where they go?

99
00:22:02,367 --> 00:22:04,207
Day 177 signing off.

100
00:22:08,918 --> 00:22:10,808
I don't know if I can do this much longer.

101
00:22:13,528 --> 00:22:16,018
I am the last one...or is there no one else?

102
00:22:18,198 --> 00:22:20,038
Anyone who watches this tape...

103
00:22:22,663 --> 00:22:24,118
Is this my punishment?

104
00:22:25,029 --> 00:22:26,719
To know that all this happened?

105
00:22:30,029 --> 00:22:31,779
Hey! Wait!

106
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:38,030
Wait! Please! Stop!

107
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:43,780
Hello?

108
00:22:46,181 --> 00:22:47,226
Hello...?

109
00:22:49,381 --> 00:22:50,621
Answer me!

110
00:24:33,871 --> 00:24:34,901
Hey. Hey!

111
00:24:36,091 --> 00:24:37,221
It's okay.

112
00:24:40,042 --> 00:24:41,460
Sorry about that.

113
00:24:42,341 --> 00:24:45,941
But I had to get this thing
off for you. What is this?

114
00:24:46,242 --> 00:24:47,577
Who did this to you?

115
00:24:51,473 --> 00:24:53,123
Do you know who I am?

116
00:24:57,543 --> 00:24:59,458
My name is Alice.

117
00:25:00,543 --> 00:25:02,903
We met in the Nevada desert
18 months ago.

118
00:25:02,904 --> 00:25:04,433
Any of this sound familiar?

119
00:25:06,334 --> 00:25:08,874
Mikey, Carlos, L.J. ...

120
00:25:09,444 --> 00:25:10,444
K-Mart.

121
00:25:12,365 --> 00:25:15,695
You left in a helicopter with a
group of survivors headed for Alaska.

122
00:25:17,345 --> 00:25:18,835
Arcadia, remember?

123
00:25:25,745 --> 00:25:27,450
Arcadia, remember?

124
00:25:29,746 --> 00:25:31,231
Arcadia, remember?

125
00:25:55,029 --> 00:25:57,104
May 4...08:00 hours

126
00:25:57,449 --> 00:25:59,964
Plotted a course to Prince
Rupert and British Columbia.

127
00:26:00,648 --> 00:26:03,483
I'll pass Vancouver,
Drop down in Seattle

128
00:26:03,485 --> 00:26:05,424
After that its San Francisco...

129
00:26:06,364 --> 00:26:08,151
And the rest of the West Coast.

130
00:26:13,315 --> 00:26:15,910
My passengers is still
talkative as ever.

131
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:21,680
Whatever that thing was
it was injecting her with some sort of drug.

132
00:26:22,261 --> 00:26:24,051
Something that causes memory loss.

133
00:26:26,601 --> 00:26:28,401
I just hope the effects aren't permanent.

134
00:26:43,463 --> 00:26:44,543
Your name...?

135
00:26:46,213 --> 00:26:47,508
Is Alice right...?

136
00:26:48,674 --> 00:26:49,984
You shouldn't speak.

137
00:26:51,353 --> 00:26:52,953
Look, I'm sorry about back there.

138
00:26:55,029 --> 00:26:56,364
I don't...I don't know what happened.

139
00:26:59,204 --> 00:27:00,679
I don't remember anything.

140
00:27:03,435 --> 00:27:04,885
I don't even know my name.

141
00:27:06,305 --> 00:27:07,455
It's Claire.

142
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:11,590
Claire Redfield.

143
00:27:12,705 --> 00:27:13,825
Claire.

144
00:27:14,506 --> 00:27:15,646
Sound familiar?

145
00:27:18,166 --> 00:27:19,296
Not really.

146
00:27:20,646 --> 00:27:21,996
You'll get used to it.

147
00:27:25,527 --> 00:27:27,237
Perhaps you can cut me loose now.

148
00:27:27,957 --> 00:27:30,097
We should get know each
other a little better first.

149
00:28:02,655 --> 00:28:04,175
City of Angels ...

150
00:28:09,806 --> 00:28:11,561
May 6th at 18:00 hours

151
00:28:11,816 --> 00:28:13,101
Los Angeles.

152
00:28:13,861 --> 00:28:15,256
No signs of life.

153
00:28:16,762 --> 00:28:18,177
Not even the undead.

154
00:28:20,217 --> 00:28:21,892
Someone must have cleaned up the city.

155
00:28:23,112 --> 00:28:24,512
But what about the rest?

156
00:28:40,318 --> 00:28:41,448
Oh! My God.

157
00:28:42,264 --> 00:28:43,284
What?

158
00:28:43,664 --> 00:28:44,814
Look over there.

159
00:28:54,445 --> 00:28:55,565
Damn.

160
00:29:09,627 --> 00:29:12,197
It's a plane. It's a plane!

161
00:29:13,667 --> 00:29:14,692
I knew it!

162
00:29:14,693 --> 00:29:16,073
Help Us.

163
00:29:16,267 --> 00:29:19,647
- I told you they will come.
- Hey! We're down here! Hello!

164
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:53,660
No way we're getting' in there.

165
00:29:59,491 --> 00:30:02,396
Where is going? Why is it flying away?

166
00:30:02,787 --> 00:30:03,993
It's not flying away.

167
00:30:04,721 --> 00:30:06,221
- circling...
- "circling"

168
00:30:08,672 --> 00:30:09,962
Damn, he's low.

169
00:30:15,372 --> 00:30:17,037
What the hell is he doing'?

170
00:30:21,393 --> 00:30:23,898
- he's goanna land.
- he's goanna land!

171
00:30:23,899 --> 00:30:25,638
Get over there...out of the away!
Quick! Go!

172
00:30:25,639 --> 00:30:27,973
- Land?
- Yeah...land!

173
00:30:29,564 --> 00:30:31,354
That is one crazy son of a bitch.

174
00:30:33,064 --> 00:30:34,609
It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance.

175
00:30:35,774 --> 00:30:36,954
Then cut me loose.

176
00:30:45,575 --> 00:30:48,575
- Thanks.
- Just don't try anything crazy, alright?

177
00:30:50,376 --> 00:30:52,326
Nothing as crazy as
what you have in mind.

178
00:31:01,927 --> 00:31:03,862
- Come on! Keep moving!
- I'm trying.

179
00:31:13,557 --> 00:31:14,797
All right, hold on.

180
00:31:18,199 --> 00:31:19,269
Hey, help me!

181
00:31:24,579 --> 00:31:25,679
Come on.

182
00:32:01,942 --> 00:32:03,117
No!

183
00:32:11,884 --> 00:32:13,479
- Hold him!
- Grab it!

184
00:32:20,884 --> 00:32:22,921
-That's it
-Good job.

185
00:32:31,825 --> 00:32:35,135
- Nice landing.
- I think technically is called crashing.

186
00:32:39,286 --> 00:32:42,304
- Luther West.
- Alice.

187
00:32:42,836 --> 00:32:43,886
And this is Claire.

188
00:32:44,987 --> 00:32:46,367
Luther West.

189
00:32:46,368 --> 00:32:47,368
It is a pleasure to meet you.

190
00:32:53,588 --> 00:32:55,603
- Hi! My name is Crystal.
- No, no, no!

191
00:32:55,603 --> 00:32:58,887
Enough with the introductions.
So you're here to help, right?

192
00:32:58,958 --> 00:33:00,878
- can you get us out?
- are you from Arcadia?

193
00:33:01,188 --> 00:33:03,313
- What did you say?
- are you from Arcadia?

194
00:33:03,448 --> 00:33:05,428
- What do you know about Arcadia?
- They said that they can help us!

195
00:33:06,088 --> 00:33:08,533
There are other survivors,
civilization and safety.

196
00:33:08,534 --> 00:33:09,823
Infection free.

197
00:33:09,824 --> 00:33:11,038
So they sent you, right?

198
00:33:11,809 --> 00:33:14,304
- No.
- But there are others out there?

199
00:33:14,305 --> 00:33:17,314
- Like you?
- It's just us.

200
00:33:18,539 --> 00:33:21,394
- There'll be no rescue?
- I'm sorry...	Oh...

201
00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:30,450
- Sorry.
- Don't even think about it...they had their hopes up

202
00:33:31,555 --> 00:33:33,465
Thery thought you could take them
to the promise lands.

203
00:33:34,189 --> 00:33:35,391
Angel Ortiz.

204
00:33:35,991 --> 00:33:37,306
That was some fine flying!

205
00:33:37,931 --> 00:33:39,191
Thanks.

206
00:33:46,692 --> 00:33:47,842
What's the prognosis?

207
00:33:48,829 --> 00:33:50,292
- She'll live.
- Yeah.

208
00:33:51,426 --> 00:33:55,433
You know...I have the strangest feeling...

209
00:33:55,523 --> 00:33:56,593
I know you.

210
00:33:58,793 --> 00:34:00,558
Yeah...I get that lot.

211
00:34:01,143 --> 00:34:02,233
You a sports fan, huh?

212
00:34:02,643 --> 00:34:03,893
You like basketball?

213
00:34:04,644 --> 00:34:06,874
- Not really.
- No? Oh.

214
00:34:08,494 --> 00:34:11,654
Then maybe just a fan of...
A fine timepiece.

215
00:34:17,005 --> 00:34:20,455
Yeah. Luther here is our resident
superstar.

216
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,615
So, tell me about Arcadia?

217
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:25,716
What exactly do you know?

218
00:34:26,088 --> 00:34:27,625
Just what we heard from their transmissions.

219
00:34:28,056 --> 00:34:29,836
We've been receiving that broadcast for a week.

220
00:34:30,496 --> 00:34:32,151
Food and shelter, safety
and security ...

221
00:34:32,496 --> 00:34:34,851
- No infection.
- We thought they sent you.

222
00:34:35,846 --> 00:34:38,326
We launched flares for days
to get their attention.

223
00:34:38,957 --> 00:34:40,097
Flares?

224
00:34:42,347 --> 00:34:44,247
Who goanna see flares
from Alaska?

225
00:34:44,978 --> 00:34:46,178
- Alaska?
- Alaska?

226
00:34:46,497 --> 00:34:48,137
Arcadia...I've been there.

227
00:34:48,466 --> 00:34:49,598
It's in Alaska.

228
00:34:49,948 --> 00:34:52,248
- It's a town or so we thought.
- A town?

229
00:34:53,498 --> 00:34:55,123
I don't think so.

230
00:34:56,504 --> 00:34:57,684
Take a look.

231
00:34:58,099 --> 00:34:59,099
At what?

232
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:05,310
You see?

233
00:35:07,446 --> 00:35:08,629
It's not a town.

234
00:35:10,885 --> 00:35:11,950
It's a ship.

235
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,780
I recorded this from the short-wave.

236
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:18,033
This is Arcadia...broadcasting on the
emergency frequency.

237
00:35:18,576 --> 00:35:22,346
There is no infection. We offer safety and
security, food and shelter.

238
00:35:22,347 --> 00:35:24,131
It's..It's the same message we've heard.

239
00:35:24,132 --> 00:35:26,621
They must have been sailing
up and down the coast picking up survivors.

240
00:35:26,917 --> 00:35:29,532
This is Arcadia...broadcasting on the
emergency frequency.

241
00:35:32,402 --> 00:35:33,477
What is that?

242
00:35:33,834 --> 00:35:34,834
I don't know.

243
00:35:35,557 --> 00:35:37,512
That was the we heard from them.

244
00:35:37,933 --> 00:35:39,321
Then it just stopped.

245
00:35:40,943 --> 00:35:42,142
That was two days ago.

246
00:35:43,384 --> 00:35:45,224
We've been sending up flares on the hour.

247
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:47,944
And when you have arrived,
of course, we thought they had sent you.

248
00:35:56,554 --> 00:35:57,554
Claire.

249
00:35:58,999 --> 00:36:00,254
That ship over there...

250
00:36:01,185 --> 00:36:02,408
That's Arcadia.

251
00:36:02,575 --> 00:36:03,591
I know.

252
00:36:04,422 --> 00:36:07,164
- You remember?
- I remember the beach.

253
00:36:12,955 --> 00:36:14,598
People were coming to help us.

254
00:36:16,066 --> 00:36:18,730
What happened?
Why didn't you go with others?

255
00:36:20,097 --> 00:36:22,487
I don't know. I can't remember.

256
00:36:27,072 --> 00:36:28,762
We have to get to that ship.

257
00:36:29,939 --> 00:36:31,633
We have to get to that ship.

258
00:37:49,465 --> 00:37:50,721
Welcome to your new home.

259
00:37:51,445 --> 00:37:52,559
Cell Block B

260
00:37:59,770 --> 00:38:04,083
Crystal's our cook. The menus are not
extensive, but she's master what she does.

261
00:38:05,004 --> 00:38:06,491
Sorry I didn't bring better news.

262
00:38:06,904 --> 00:38:09,951
Get used to disappointment, right?
That my agent used to say.

263
00:38:10,817 --> 00:38:11,904
Were you an actress?

264
00:38:12,954 --> 00:38:15,532
Came to Hollywood to live the dream
and ended up waiting tables.

265
00:38:15,534 --> 00:38:18,048
Why are we waiting? Excuse me
I'm hungry. Thank you.

266
00:38:18,729 --> 00:38:20,433
- Get out of here.
- Thank you.

267
00:38:23,868 --> 00:38:25,852
I had plenty of creeps right here in my time.

268
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:28,996
What's his story?

269
00:38:28,996 --> 00:38:31,663
Back in the world, he was
kind of a big movie producer.

270
00:38:31,868 --> 00:38:33,989
The boy's got stick to his ass!

271
00:38:37,004 --> 00:38:40,288
Kim Young used to intern for him
But he still hasn't figured out the world has changed.

272
00:38:53,751 --> 00:38:55,204
That plane of yours...

273
00:38:55,204 --> 00:38:56,325
You think it can still fly?

274
00:38:57,171 --> 00:38:58,886
It can fly...but it only takes two.

275
00:38:59,421 --> 00:39:01,793
So you could take us to
Arcadia one at a time.

276
00:39:01,872 --> 00:39:04,404
Look, I think she was lucky
to land here once.

277
00:39:04,822 --> 00:39:06,561
Five or six times
would be suicide.

278
00:39:08,422 --> 00:39:11,133
- No offense.
- None taken.

279
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:17,347
There has to be another way out.

280
00:39:17,893 --> 00:39:19,464
We have to get to that ship.

281
00:39:19,465 --> 00:39:21,443
Well... There is the...   {Clears throat}

282
00:39:24,804 --> 00:39:26,918
- What?
- Nothing.

283
00:39:26,919 --> 00:39:30,686
Look, it would be a waste of your time.

284
00:39:32,886 --> 00:39:34,264
I have time to waste.

285
00:39:38,224 --> 00:39:40,724
When shit hit the fan,
We took refuge in the prison.

286
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:44,225
Seemed like the biggest,
strongest walls...

287
00:39:45,125 --> 00:39:46,850
Best chance of keeping
those thing out.

288
00:39:48,308 --> 00:39:51,394
By the time we got here, the guards
and inmates were already long gone.

289
00:39:52,811 --> 00:39:54,247
I guess...

290
00:39:54,484 --> 00:39:56,223
When peoples starting
eating one other ...

291
00:39:56,924 --> 00:39:59,141
Wasn't much fun keeping
anyone locked up.

292
00:40:00,539 --> 00:40:02,027
We thought the place was abandoned.

293
00:40:03,508 --> 00:40:04,942
Until we made a discovery.

294
00:40:10,328 --> 00:40:11,328
Wendell...

295
00:40:12,064 --> 00:40:13,289
It's time to take a break.

296
00:40:13,290 --> 00:40:14,670
It's about god damn time.

297
00:40:14,996 --> 00:40:18,928
I hate being down here.
I hear movement...in the walls.

298
00:40:20,125 --> 00:40:21,304
Well, let's check it out.

299
00:40:22,956 --> 00:40:24,229
We'll be back in a minute.

300
00:40:26,708 --> 00:40:27,729
Come on.

301
00:41:04,333 --> 00:41:05,409
Name's Chris.

302
00:41:09,283 --> 00:41:10,892
You're the one flying that plane.

303
00:41:13,233 --> 00:41:14,335
How do you know that?

304
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:17,534
Wendell isn't only one who hears things.

305
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,712
I am glad you made it.

306
00:41:21,555 --> 00:41:23,792
Maybe you can talk some
sense into these people's.

307
00:41:25,312 --> 00:41:26,680
What do you mean?

308
00:41:29,235 --> 00:41:30,687
Isn't it obvious?

309
00:41:31,306 --> 00:41:32,514
I'm not a prisoner.

310
00:41:34,236 --> 00:41:35,514
I shouldn't be in here.

311
00:41:39,976 --> 00:41:41,932
I was working with military unit.

312
00:41:42,763 --> 00:41:44,747
We were using this place
as a staging post.

313
00:41:46,637 --> 00:41:49,625
Things were already pretty bad when
the order came through from the Governor

314
00:41:49,626 --> 00:41:51,442
to release all immates.

315
00:41:52,266 --> 00:41:55,989
You see, we need as many people on
the streets as possible to fight those things.

316
00:41:57,499 --> 00:41:58,921
And it was chaos.

317
00:42:00,338 --> 00:42:02,780
We were pulling out and a
gang of prisoners jumped me.

318
00:42:03,757 --> 00:42:05,451
Guess they thought I was guard.

319
00:42:06,328 --> 00:42:08,873
When I woke up, my unit was gone ...

320
00:42:09,926 --> 00:42:11,165
And I was in here.

321
00:42:12,139 --> 00:42:13,684
Their idea of joke.

322
00:42:15,524 --> 00:42:16,738
You don't believe me?

323
00:42:20,295 --> 00:42:21,440
If the others ...

324
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:24,070
You need to get me
out of here.

325
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:26,264
We're all trapped here
one way or another.

326
00:42:26,266 --> 00:42:28,944
That's true but I can help you.

327
00:42:30,070 --> 00:42:32,339
-Seen enough?
-You find anything?

328
00:42:32,441 --> 00:42:33,540
No.

329
00:42:34,141 --> 00:42:35,586
I know way out of this place.

330
00:42:41,638 --> 00:42:43,760
You get me out of here
I'll do the same for you

331
00:42:45,623 --> 00:42:46,807
You'll goanna need me!

332
00:42:48,825 --> 00:42:51,724
- Have you checked out what its talking about?
- His way out?

333
00:42:52,742 --> 00:42:55,452
He's not telling us shit until we let him out.
And I'm not letting him out.

334
00:42:56,324 --> 00:42:57,373
The man is a killer.

335
00:42:57,693 --> 00:42:59,443
- Really?
- I can see it in his eyes.

336
00:42:59,534 --> 00:43:02,123
- How can you be so sure?
- I know people.

337
00:43:02,644 --> 00:43:04,584
Interesting. Tell me...

338
00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:07,668
What you seen when you look in my eyes?

339
00:43:15,807 --> 00:43:17,513
Whoa!	Holy Shit.

340
00:43:19,375 --> 00:43:20,851
Girl's gotta be prepared.

341
00:43:23,523 --> 00:43:25,264
What could you possibly want with those?

342
00:43:26,266 --> 00:43:27,446
It's a hobby.

343
00:43:28,211 --> 00:43:29,431
A hobby?

344
00:43:30,271 --> 00:43:31,271
All right.

345
00:43:32,297 --> 00:43:33,616
Well, I'll see you in the morning.

346
00:43:44,262 --> 00:43:46,003
No sign of anyone on deck.

347
00:43:47,798 --> 00:43:49,108
Your friends are out there.

348
00:43:52,048 --> 00:43:53,048
I think so.

349
00:43:54,249 --> 00:43:55,577
You don't remember?

350
00:43:56,482 --> 00:43:57,848
It's coming back.

351
00:43:58,714 --> 00:43:59,760
Slowly...

352
00:44:03,649 --> 00:44:05,077
Nothing makes any sense.

353
00:45:44,721 --> 00:45:48,409
- We still have running water.
- Very civilized

354
00:45:48,897 --> 00:45:50,081
We do our best.

355
00:45:53,570 --> 00:45:56,560
- It's cold.
- Our best only goes so far.

356
00:45:57,560 --> 00:45:59,532
- These are for you.
- Thank you.

357
00:46:01,495 --> 00:46:02,880
I guess I should leave you to it?

358
00:46:03,945 --> 00:46:05,277
I guess you should.

359
00:46:05,278 --> 00:46:07,316
- I'll be right outside.
- Thank you.

360
00:46:21,462 --> 00:46:22,476
Luther...?

361
00:46:24,862 --> 00:46:26,091
Luther?

362
00:47:16,805 --> 00:47:18,870
- Easy, baby.
Move it!

363
00:47:19,367 --> 00:47:21,983
Hey, I'll just be on my way now.

364
00:47:22,607 --> 00:47:26,375
- Take it easy, take it easy, take it easy.
- I didn't see you.

365
00:47:55,549 --> 00:47:57,391
What is that smell?

366
00:47:57,934 --> 00:47:59,691
Must've burrowed up from the sewers...

367
00:48:00,154 --> 00:48:02,312
Wendell said he heard
things moving behind the walls.

368
00:48:02,312 --> 00:48:04,621
So...so...these can just
burst out anywhere?

369
00:48:05,301 --> 00:48:08,311
- We gotta get out of this place.
- Arcadia will send help.

370
00:48:08,572 --> 00:48:09,618
No one's coming to get us.

371
00:48:09,619 --> 00:48:13,692
Okay? No one.
We have to help ourselves.

372
00:48:14,035 --> 00:48:16,281
- Now this plane that you have?
- It can't hold all of us.

373
00:48:16,282 --> 00:48:18,009
- We draw straws...
- No!

374
00:48:18,010 --> 00:48:20,865
We all get out of here
And no one is left behind

375
00:48:21,273 --> 00:48:22,273
Great.

376
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:23,543
How are we goanna do that?

377
00:48:24,270 --> 00:48:26,275
Walk out of here...just single file?

378
00:48:26,836 --> 00:48:28,798
Are you crazy?

379
00:48:29,617 --> 00:48:31,826
- They didn't want him getting out.
- That's right. He's dangerous.

380
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:34,366
Angel...what do you think?

381
00:48:35,923 --> 00:48:37,663
I think we don't have much of a choice.

382
00:48:38,025 --> 00:48:41,670
This is insane. Crystal, Crystal, Crystal?
Look at me. What do you think?

383
00:48:41,671 --> 00:48:43,191
I mean, not even you're that dumb

384
00:48:43,471 --> 00:48:46,508
I guess I am. I agree with Angel.

385
00:48:47,376 --> 00:48:50,119
If this guy knows a way out
I want to hear it.

386
00:48:50,764 --> 00:48:51,776
All right.

387
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:53,518
Seriously?

388
00:48:54,942 --> 00:48:56,849
This...this is a mistake.

389
00:48:57,676 --> 00:49:00,847
- This is a big mistake.
- You'd better keep your eyes on him.

390
00:49:13,128 --> 00:49:14,706
I was wondering how long it would take.

391
00:49:29,179 --> 00:49:31,080
Boo!	Ahh!
Alright, let's get the hell out of here.

392
00:49:34,830 --> 00:49:36,501
- Claire?
- What?

393
00:49:40,507 --> 00:49:41,716
Claire, it's me.

394
00:49:46,684 --> 00:49:47,808
It's Chris.

395
00:49:51,176 --> 00:49:53,430
- I don't know you.
- Claire?

396
00:49:54,932 --> 00:49:56,441
I'm your brother, remember?

397
00:49:57,983 --> 00:49:59,299
What the hell has happened to you?

398
00:50:01,283 --> 00:50:03,773
Hey. It's okay. Let him go.

399
00:50:08,613 --> 00:50:10,274
Look, she suffered some sort
of memory loss.

400
00:50:11,286 --> 00:50:14,093
If you really are her brother...
It will come back.

401
00:50:16,054 --> 00:50:19,047
Alright, this is very touching...
I mean, a family reunion...

402
00:50:19,048 --> 00:50:23,163
But if we could just get a move on please?
Before we are all eaten the fuck alive!

403
00:50:33,019 --> 00:50:37,267
Behind those doors is a UPV:
Urban Pacification Vehicle.

404
00:50:37,536 --> 00:50:39,638
Prison kept it in case of a serious riot.

405
00:50:39,639 --> 00:50:43,687
16 wheeler, steel plated,
water cannon, seats 20

406
00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:45,944
Ten tons of fun.

407
00:50:46,587 --> 00:50:49,556
Roll on out style, drive right over 'em.

408
00:50:49,557 --> 00:50:50,867
The lock's jammed.

409
00:50:51,587 --> 00:50:54,062
- Maybe we could cut through it.
- When we hit the coast

410
00:50:54,063 --> 00:50:55,738
We're going to have to transfer
to a boat or something.

411
00:50:55,966 --> 00:50:58,435
- We goanna need some more fire power.
- I got you covered.

412
00:50:59,137 --> 00:51:01,764
When I was stationed here
We used a room in the basement as an armoury.

413
00:51:02,337 --> 00:51:04,091
It's got every weapon
you can dream of.

414
00:51:04,739 --> 00:51:07,292
How do you know you're unit didn't take
them with 'em when they pulled out?

415
00:51:07,548 --> 00:51:10,410
Because...by the end...
There were lot more guns

416
00:51:10,412 --> 00:51:12,127
than people to use them.

417
00:51:16,539 --> 00:51:17,735
You go get the guns! Luther!

418
00:51:22,197 --> 00:51:23,290
Oh! My god!

419
00:51:30,216 --> 00:51:31,216
What is this?

420
00:51:31,317 --> 00:51:33,720
They had pumps to keep the water
out of the foundations.

421
00:51:34,742 --> 00:51:38,334
When electricity failed,
some of the lower levels start filling up.

422
00:51:38,987 --> 00:51:40,685
There are another two
floors down there

423
00:51:41,658 --> 00:51:43,061
How far down is the armoury?

424
00:51:44,363 --> 00:51:45,556
All the way.

425
00:51:47,943 --> 00:51:49,068
Luther, come on!

426
00:51:50,408 --> 00:51:52,348
Get back! Get back!

427
00:51:58,643 --> 00:52:01,716
- Where do you think you're going?
- I was swimming champ back in high school.

428
00:52:03,464 --> 00:52:05,740
- Is that right?
- Here.

429
00:52:11,142 --> 00:52:12,666
So now you're goanna trust me with a gun?

430
00:52:13,213 --> 00:52:14,827
Yeah. Why not?

431
00:52:18,616 --> 00:52:20,130
Luther, just shoot
That motherfucker.

432
00:52:26,596 --> 00:52:28,043
What the fuck is that thing?

433
00:54:49,141 --> 00:54:51,359
All right. Let's go.

434
00:55:10,011 --> 00:55:11,059
Let's go!

435
00:55:35,994 --> 00:55:37,317
Nice.

436
00:55:51,916 --> 00:55:52,996
Damn.

437
00:56:10,730 --> 00:56:12,492
There must be hundreds of them out there.

438
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:15,392
We can't go back that way.

439
00:56:20,538 --> 00:56:22,811
- Oh shit!
- What? What do you mean, "Oh shit!"?

440
00:56:23,553 --> 00:56:24,657
What? What is this?

441
00:56:26,218 --> 00:56:29,436
- What do you think it is?
- Oh! Don't tell me that thing fits inside of there.

442
00:56:29,685 --> 00:56:31,169
Can you put this back together?

443
00:56:31,695 --> 00:56:33,484
Maybe, but it could take a week.

444
00:56:34,639 --> 00:56:35,839
What do we do now?

445
00:56:36,647 --> 00:56:37,720
I know.

446
00:56:43,570 --> 00:56:47,220
Bennett...What have you done?

447
00:56:54,584 --> 00:56:56,021
Luther, we gotta get out of here!

448
00:56:56,462 --> 00:56:57,666
Come on!

449
00:57:23,904 --> 00:57:25,151
Do you hear that?

450
00:57:30,056 --> 00:57:32,306
- Come on, baby. Come on!
- What are we doing?

451
00:57:32,308 --> 00:57:34,269
- We getting out here!
- But the others...

452
00:57:34,270 --> 00:57:37,038
Fuck the others!
Now get on board.

453
00:57:37,039 --> 00:57:38,789
Bennett!
What are you doing?

454
00:57:39,575 --> 00:57:41,524
- Hey!
- Kim Yong! Don't do this.

455
00:57:42,095 --> 00:57:43,175
Open this door!

456
00:57:45,189 --> 00:57:46,293
Please! Please!

457
00:57:51,426 --> 00:57:52,427
Bennett!

458
00:57:59,966 --> 00:58:01,046
Shit!

459
00:58:02,460 --> 00:58:04,127
That’s right, bitch! Fuck you!

460
00:58:09,578 --> 00:58:11,938
Yes! Yes!

461
00:58:12,758 --> 00:58:14,593
- Fucking' bitch...
- I'm sorry.

462
00:58:15,229 --> 00:58:16,385
I'm so sorry.

463
00:58:16,499 --> 00:58:17,891
He's heading for the Arcadia.

464
00:58:30,495 --> 00:58:31,579
Alice!

465
00:58:52,510 --> 00:58:53,533
Come on!

466
00:59:08,139 --> 00:59:09,509
Hit the cell block!

467
00:59:11,749 --> 00:59:14,096
- Move!
- I'll meet you there!

468
00:59:16,350 --> 00:59:17,648
This thing has no power!

469
00:59:18,385 --> 00:59:19,805
We won't need power!

470
00:59:24,766 --> 00:59:25,755
Oh shit!

471
00:59:49,237 --> 00:59:51,093
Hey, head for the shower block. Go!

472
01:00:49,493 --> 01:00:50,543
Over Here!

473
01:01:39,027 --> 01:01:41,697
- You alright?
- I'm fine. Thanks.

474
01:01:44,924 --> 01:01:46,617
This is a joke, right?

475
01:01:47,532 --> 01:01:49,948
- No.
- Tunnels leads to the sewers, sewers lead to

476
01:01:49,950 --> 01:01:50,976
the storm drains...

477
01:01:50,976 --> 01:01:52,413
Storm drains leads to sea.

478
01:01:53,649 --> 01:01:54,709
It's our only chance.

479
01:01:54,949 --> 01:01:57,082
I'll take point. I got your back.

480
01:02:01,150 --> 01:02:02,257
Ladies...

481
01:02:07,050 --> 01:02:08,122
Alright, you next.

482
01:02:10,071 --> 01:02:12,001
- I can't do it.
- You can.

483
01:02:13,901 --> 01:02:15,028
Let's go!

484
01:06:14,474 --> 01:06:16,074
Shhh...Those things are close.

485
01:06:17,973 --> 01:06:19,458
We found a way out
Just out there

486
01:06:20,143 --> 01:06:22,593
The tunnel drop into
a storm drain. Go.

487
01:06:31,950 --> 01:06:33,206
Where's Kim Yong?

488
01:06:36,107 --> 01:06:37,246
Go. Go!

489
01:06:53,177 --> 01:06:54,395
Knew you'd make it.

490
01:07:03,318 --> 01:07:04,378
Luther!

491
01:07:07,278 --> 01:07:08,478
Go!

492
01:07:11,183 --> 01:07:12,398
Luther!

493
01:07:17,649 --> 01:07:19,052
We can't help him now.

494
01:07:21,311 --> 01:07:22,838
We have to move on.

495
01:08:49,488 --> 01:08:50,888
No welcome party, huh?

496
01:09:09,950 --> 01:09:11,356
Looks like Bennett made it.

497
01:09:14,070 --> 01:09:15,490
Let's check inside.

498
01:09:33,491 --> 01:09:35,380
- Find anyone?
- Nothing.

499
01:09:36,112 --> 01:09:38,732
I checked the crew quarters...
They're all gone.

500
01:09:39,522 --> 01:09:41,052
Looks like they left in hurry.

501
01:09:43,176 --> 01:09:46,052
This is Arcadia, broadcasting on the
emergency frequency.

502
01:09:46,054 --> 01:09:50,248
There is no infection. We offer safety
and security, food and shelter.

503
01:09:52,243 --> 01:09:54,966
Fuel...power...Everything's
Running normally.

504
01:09:54,968 --> 01:09:57,256
Look at this. It's the ships log.

505
01:09:58,044 --> 01:09:59,924
Crew launched the life
boats three days ago.

506
01:10:00,656 --> 01:10:02,591
Exactly when the transmission stopped.

507
01:10:03,076 --> 01:10:06,380
But it says there’s still
2,000 survivors on board.

508
01:10:13,746 --> 01:10:15,617
We have to search every inch of the ship.

509
01:10:32,162 --> 01:10:34,786
Umbrella...of course.

510
01:10:36,421 --> 01:10:37,962
Never where coming for us.

511
01:10:55,053 --> 01:10:56,133
This whole thing...

512
01:10:56,976 --> 01:10:57,815
The beacon...

513
01:10:58,795 --> 01:10:59,754
Was a lie.

514
01:11:00,351 --> 01:11:01,451
And that's not the worst part.

515
01:11:02,797 --> 01:11:03,658
It's a trap!

516
01:11:38,126 --> 01:11:39,179
Where is everybody?

517
01:11:43,719 --> 01:11:44,901
I don't understand.

518
01:11:53,001 --> 01:11:54,086
I think I do.

519
01:11:55,962 --> 01:11:57,334
They're underneath our feet.

520
01:12:04,475 --> 01:12:06,687
They're holding survivors
to experiment on them.

521
01:12:09,106 --> 01:12:09,981
Look...

522
01:12:11,463 --> 01:12:12,591
It's K-Mart...she's here.

523
01:12:13,619 --> 01:12:16,700
Bring them up. All of them.

524
01:12:36,091 --> 01:12:38,612
Here she is...K-mart

525
01:12:39,097 --> 01:12:40,089
Get her out.

526
01:12:43,744 --> 01:12:44,663
Baa.

527
01:12:44,864 --> 01:12:47,118
K-Mart. It's okay.
It's okay.

528
01:12:47,597 --> 01:12:49,308
K-Mart, ok, it's all right.

529
01:12:49,441 --> 01:12:50,414
I'll get that thing off her.

530
01:12:50,493 --> 01:12:51,727
Go let everyone else out.

531
01:12:52,097 --> 01:12:54,566
We your friends.
and right now, I need your help.

532
01:12:55,007 --> 01:12:56,073
-Let me get this off of you.

533
01:15:31,385 --> 01:15:32,909
Why am I not surprised?

534
01:15:34,144 --> 01:15:35,636
You weren't too hard to find

535
01:15:36,454 --> 01:15:38,600
Our satellite system
is still operational.

536
01:15:39,395 --> 01:15:41,569
And not as many people fly these days.

537
01:15:42,819 --> 01:15:47,060
Besides, I always knew
You'd be drawn to your friends.

538
01:15:48,315 --> 01:15:49,749
Loyalty...

539
01:15:50,114 --> 01:15:51,269
Highly overrated.

540
01:15:55,338 --> 01:15:56,318
Stop!

541
01:15:58,254 --> 01:15:59,698
Down!

542
01:16:01,228 --> 01:16:03,051
Wouldn't want you
Harming my pets

543
01:16:06,503 --> 01:16:08,045
Drop your guns.

544
01:16:14,015 --> 01:16:15,316
Good...kick them to me.

545
01:16:18,793 --> 01:16:19,816
Your hands.

546
01:16:23,407 --> 01:16:24,817
You don't look so good, Bennett.

547
01:16:25,668 --> 01:16:28,652
Yeah, I am looking forward to
Playing with your pretty face.

548
01:16:28,860 --> 01:16:29,840
What do you want from me?

549
01:16:30,691 --> 01:16:32,436
The T-virus brought me back.

550
01:16:38,081 --> 01:16:39,868
But it's so strong.

551
01:16:40,790 --> 01:16:42,598
It fights for full control.

552
01:16:44,465 --> 01:16:47,148
And I thought that if
I ingested fresh human DNA

553
01:16:47,847 --> 01:16:49,469
I could redress the balance.

554
01:16:50,153 --> 01:16:52,214
No wonder your crew
abandoned ship.

555
01:16:52,964 --> 01:16:56,509
No matter.
Now I have a new subordinate.

556
01:16:57,311 --> 01:16:58,609
And a new plan.

557
01:16:59,103 --> 01:17:02,267
You were the only one who
successfully bonded with the T-virus.

558
01:17:03,251 --> 01:17:05,260
Your DNA is stronger than the others.

559
01:17:06,477 --> 01:17:10,367
I ingest you...
I gain control.

560
01:17:13,381 --> 01:17:14,871
That's pretty smart thinking.

561
01:17:15,678 --> 01:17:17,888
There is only one problem
with that plan.

562
01:17:18,235 --> 01:17:19,515
Stop. Right, right there.

563
01:17:21,064 --> 01:17:22,187
And what is that?

564
01:17:23,125 --> 01:17:24,379
I'm not on the menu.

565
01:18:02,462 --> 01:18:05,432
Well, isn't this one big
family reunion?

566
01:18:06,756 --> 01:18:12,545
Chris & Claire Redfield...you've really
become quite inconvenience for me.

567
01:18:14,797 --> 01:18:16,760
I told you I'd be bringing a few friends.

568
01:18:21,931 --> 01:18:23,525
You should've brought more.

569
01:19:37,205 --> 01:19:38,084
Claire!

570
01:19:39,028 --> 01:19:39,973
Claire!

571
01:20:30,166 --> 01:20:32,571
Don't...even think about it.

572
01:20:39,938 --> 01:20:41,157
Who the fuck are you?

573
01:21:31,070 --> 01:21:32,400
I don't think so.

574
01:21:53,538 --> 01:21:55,824
No! Don't do that! I'm a producer!

575
01:21:58,538 --> 01:22:00,125
Open those doors!

576
01:22:00,586 --> 01:22:04,763
You're deal with some serious consequences
You motherfuckers.

577
01:22:05,329 --> 01:22:06,153
Open the...

578
01:22:10,538 --> 01:22:12,791
You're goanna live to regret this.
All of ya!

579
01:22:20,648 --> 01:22:21,730
Oh god.

580
01:22:23,204 --> 01:22:24,421
I just wanna go home.

581
01:22:33,402 --> 01:22:35,565
Hey. It's goanna be okay.

582
01:22:38,767 --> 01:22:39,645
No!

583
01:22:39,981 --> 01:22:41,128
Where is Alice!

584
01:23:00,544 --> 01:23:01,624
Come on!

585
01:23:40,514 --> 01:23:41,691
Yeah!

586
01:23:43,347 --> 01:23:44,784
I really didn't want you to miss that.

587
01:24:04,451 --> 01:24:05,492
Let's Rock!

588
01:24:07,087 --> 01:24:08,457
Start something' bitches.

589
01:24:20,130 --> 01:24:21,246
It's a miracle.

590
01:24:23,566 --> 01:24:26,186
I never dreamed that was
this many of them left alive.

591
01:24:30,303 --> 01:24:31,417
So what next?

592
01:24:36,887 --> 01:24:39,362
This is Arcadia, broadcasting on the
emergency frequency.

593
01:24:41,834 --> 01:24:45,769
I say...that we live up to the promise.

594
01:24:47,255 --> 01:24:50,744
This is Arcadia, broadcasting on the
emergency frequency.

595
01:24:51,276 --> 01:24:53,677
Location: 118.30 degrees West.

596
01:24:54,218 --> 01:24:56,374
34.05 degrees North.

597
01:24:56,780 --> 01:25:00,381
There is no infection.
Repeat, there is no infection.

598
01:25:01,291 --> 01:25:03,061
We offer safety, security,

599

01:25:07,416 --> 01:25:08,383
We will help you

602
01:25:09,616 --> 01:25:10,590
There is hope.

603
01:25:35,050 --> 01:25:36,800
- What is that?
- Trouble.

604
01:26:49,001 --> 01:26:53,001
Deployed minute T-minus 57 seconds ,
