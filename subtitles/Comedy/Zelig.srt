1
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,520
He was the phenomenon
of the twenties.

2
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:40,650
When you think that he was
as well-known as Lindbergh...

3
00:00:40,687 --> 00:00:42,791
it's really quite astonishing.

4
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:48,869
His story reflected the nature
of our civilization...

5
00:00:48,908 --> 00:00:50,795
the character of our times.

6
00:00:50,828 --> 00:00:53,729
Yet it was also
one man's story...

7
00:00:53,772 --> 00:00:57,087
and all the themes
of our culture were there...

8
00:00:57,130 --> 00:00:59,847
heroism, will,
things like that...

9
00:00:59,882 --> 00:01:03,591
but when you look back on it,
it was very strange.

10
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:07,167
Well, it is ironic...

11
00:01:07,208 --> 00:01:10,207
to see how quickly
he has faded from memory...

12
00:01:10,248 --> 00:01:13,411
considering what
an astounding record he made.

13
00:01:13,446 --> 00:01:15,813
He was,
of course, very amusing...

14
00:01:15,846 --> 00:01:19,642
but at the same time
touched a nerve in people...

15
00:01:19,685 --> 00:01:24,921
perhaps in a way in which they
would prefer not to be touched.

16
00:01:24,963 --> 00:01:28,224
It certainly is
a very bizarre story.

17
00:01:41,952 --> 00:01:44,406
The year is 1928.

18
00:01:44,447 --> 00:01:48,243
America, enjoying a decade
of unequaled prosperity...

19
00:01:48,286 --> 00:01:49,780
has gone wild.

20
00:01:49,821 --> 00:01:51,861
The Jazz Age, it is called.

21
00:01:51,901 --> 00:01:55,413
The rhythms are syncopated.
The morals are looser.

22
00:01:55,453 --> 00:01:57,972
The liquor is cheaper,
when you can get it.

23
00:01:58,012 --> 00:02:03,226
It is a time of diverse heroes
and madcap stunts...

24
00:02:03,258 --> 00:02:06,902
of speak-easies
and flamboyant parties.

25
00:02:06,937 --> 00:02:09,620
One typical party occurs
at the Long Island estate...

26
00:02:09,657 --> 00:02:12,853
of Mr. And Mrs.
Henry Porter Sutton...

27
00:02:12,888 --> 00:02:15,822
socialites,
patrons of the arts.

28
00:02:15,864 --> 00:02:17,270
Politicians and poets...

29
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:20,149
rub elbows
with the cream of high society.

30
00:02:20,182 --> 00:02:23,029
Present at the party
is Scott Fitzgerald...

31
00:02:23,061 --> 00:02:25,297
who is to cast perspective
on the twenties...

32
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:27,536
for all future generations.

33
00:02:27,573 --> 00:02:28,849
He writes in his notebook...

34
00:02:28,884 --> 00:02:31,731
about a curious little man
named Leon Selwyn, or Zelman...

35
00:02:31,763 --> 00:02:34,610
who seemed clearly
to be an aristocrat...

36
00:02:34,643 --> 00:02:38,984
and extolled the very rich
as he chatted with socialites.

37
00:02:39,025 --> 00:02:41,872
He spoke adoringly of Coolidge
and the Republican Party...

38
00:02:41,905 --> 00:02:44,587
all in an upper-class
Boston accent.

39
00:02:44,624 --> 00:02:46,412
"An hour later,"
writes Fitzgerald...

40
00:02:46,448 --> 00:02:49,294
"I was stunned
to see the same man...

41
00:02:49,327 --> 00:02:51,214
"speaking with
the kitchen help.

42
00:02:51,246 --> 00:02:53,929
"Now he claimed
to be a Democrat...

43
00:02:53,966 --> 00:02:58,667
"and his accent seemed coarse,
as if he were one of the crowd."

44
00:02:58,701 --> 00:03:02,083
It's the first small notice
taken of Leonard Zelig.

45
00:03:02,124 --> 00:03:04,709
Florida, one year later.

46
00:03:04,747 --> 00:03:06,569
An odd incident occurs...

47
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:09,449
at the New York Yankees'
training camp.

48
00:03:09,482 --> 00:03:11,304
Journalists,
anxious as always...

49
00:03:11,337 --> 00:03:15,330
to immortalize the exploits
of the great home-run hitters...

50
00:03:15,369 --> 00:03:17,256
notice a strange new player...

51
00:03:17,289 --> 00:03:20,135
waiting his turn at bat
after Babe Ruth.

52
00:03:20,168 --> 00:03:22,175
He's listed on the roster
as Lou Zelig...

53
00:03:22,215 --> 00:03:25,563
but no one on the team
has heard of him.

54
00:03:25,606 --> 00:03:26,653
Security guards are called...

55
00:03:26,693 --> 00:03:28,416
and he's escorted
from the premises.

56
00:03:28,454 --> 00:03:33,308
It appears as a small item
in the next day's newspaper.

57
00:03:40,003 --> 00:03:42,369
Chicago, Illinois,
that same year.

58
00:03:42,402 --> 00:03:44,408
There is a private party...

59
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:47,166
at a speak-easy
on the South Side.

60
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,305
People from the most
respectable walks of life...

61
00:03:49,344 --> 00:03:52,377
dance and drink bathtub gin.

62
00:03:56,831 --> 00:04:01,107
Present that evening
was Calvin Turner, a waiter.

63
00:04:01,149 --> 00:04:03,996
A lot of gangsters
come in the place.

64
00:04:04,028 --> 00:04:06,875
They're good tippers
and take care of us.

65
00:04:06,908 --> 00:04:09,176
We take care of our customers.

66
00:04:09,212 --> 00:04:12,527
On this particular night,
here's a strange guy coming in.

67
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:14,261
I'd never seen him before.

68
00:04:14,298 --> 00:04:15,378
So I asked the one
or the other...

69
00:04:15,418 --> 00:04:17,141
I said, "John,
you know this guy?

70
00:04:17,177 --> 00:04:18,671
"You ever seen him?"
So he looks.

71
00:04:18,713 --> 00:04:20,371
"No. I ain't never
seen him before.

72
00:04:20,409 --> 00:04:21,553
"I don't know who he is...

73
00:04:21,593 --> 00:04:23,218
"but I know one thing...
he's a tough-Iooking hombre."

74
00:04:23,256 --> 00:04:24,914
So I looked over, and then...

75
00:04:24,951 --> 00:04:26,358
the next thing,
the guy had disappeared.

76
00:04:26,392 --> 00:04:28,595
I don't know where he went to.

77
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:30,997
But about this time,
the music starts...

78
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:33,070
and the band
started playing.

79
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:36,906
I looked. Here's a colored boy
over there playing trumpet.

80
00:04:36,949 --> 00:04:40,429
Man, he was playing back,
and I looked at the guy...

81
00:04:40,468 --> 00:04:42,736
and I said, "He looks
just like that gangster...

82
00:04:42,771 --> 00:04:47,472
"but the gangster was white,
and this guy is black."

83
00:04:47,506 --> 00:04:50,408
So I don't know
what's happening.

84
00:04:50,482 --> 00:04:54,507
New York City.
It is several months later.

85
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:58,318
Police are investigating
the disappearance of a clerk...

86
00:04:58,351 --> 00:04:59,758
named Leonard Zelig.

87
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:01,994
Both his landlady
and his employer...

88
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:03,753
have reported him missing.

89
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:08,131
They tell police he was an odd
little man who kept to himself.

90
00:05:08,173 --> 00:05:11,107
Two clues are found in
Zelig's Greenwich Village flat.

91
00:05:11,149 --> 00:05:16,483
One, a photograph of Zelig
with Eugene O'Neill...

92
00:05:16,523 --> 00:05:19,653
and one of him as Pagliacci.

93
00:05:22,602 --> 00:05:27,270
Acting on a tip, they trace
his whereabouts to Chinatown...

94
00:05:27,305 --> 00:05:30,151
where, in the rear
of a Chinese establishment...

95
00:05:30,184 --> 00:05:32,125
a strange-Iooking Oriental...

96
00:05:32,168 --> 00:05:35,483
who fits the description
of Leonard Zelig is discovered.

97
00:05:35,526 --> 00:05:38,842
Suspicious, the detectives
try to pull off his disguise...

98
00:05:38,886 --> 00:05:43,140
but it is not a disguise,
and a fight breaks out.

99
00:05:43,173 --> 00:05:46,816
He is removed by force
and taken to Manhattan Hospital.

100
00:05:46,852 --> 00:05:49,786
In the ambulance,
he rants and curses...

101
00:05:49,827 --> 00:05:52,193
in what sounds
like authentic Chinese.

102
00:05:52,226 --> 00:05:55,454
He is restrained
with a straitjacket.

103
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:58,805
When he emerges from the car
twenty minutes later...

104
00:05:58,848 --> 00:06:03,288
incredibly, he is no longer
Chinese, but Caucasian.

105
00:06:03,328 --> 00:06:06,175
Bewildered interns place him
in the emergency room...

106
00:06:06,207 --> 00:06:08,094
for observation.

107
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:11,671
At 7 a.m., Dr. Eudora Fletcher,
a psychiatrist...

108
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:14,808
makes her usual rounds.

109
00:06:14,845 --> 00:06:17,692
When I first heard
about this emergency case...

110
00:06:17,724 --> 00:06:19,611
I didn't think
anything peculiar...

111
00:06:19,644 --> 00:06:22,491
and when I first
laid eyes on him...

112
00:06:22,523 --> 00:06:28,305
it was a bit strange because
I mistook him for a doctor.

113
00:06:28,345 --> 00:06:31,792
He had a very professional
demeanor about him.

114
00:06:31,832 --> 00:06:33,620
As a young psychiatrist...

115
00:06:33,656 --> 00:06:36,503
Eudora Fletcher is fascinated
by Leonard Zelig.

116
00:06:36,535 --> 00:06:39,698
She convinces the conservative
staff at the hospital...

117
00:06:39,735 --> 00:06:42,451
to allow her to pursue
a study of the new admission.

118
00:06:42,486 --> 00:06:44,787
So, what do you do?

119
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:46,730
Oh, me? I'm a psychiatrist.

120
00:06:48,021 --> 00:06:51,598
I work mostly
with delusional paranoids.

121
00:06:51,635 --> 00:06:53,610
Tell me about it.

122
00:06:53,651 --> 00:06:55,057
There's not much to tell.

123
00:06:55,091 --> 00:06:57,457
I work mostly
on the continent...

124
00:06:57,490 --> 00:07:00,337
and I've written quite a few
psychoanalytic papers.

125
00:07:00,369 --> 00:07:03,052
I worked with Freud in Vienna.

126
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:05,772
We broke over the concept
of penis envy.

127
00:07:05,808 --> 00:07:09,670
Freud felt that it
should be limited to women.

128
00:07:09,711 --> 00:07:13,507
It's not that he was
making any sense at all.

129
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:16,397
It was a conglomeration
of psychological double-talk...

130
00:07:16,429 --> 00:07:18,316
that he had apparently heard...

131
00:07:18,349 --> 00:07:20,519
or was familiar with
through reading.

132
00:07:20,557 --> 00:07:22,379
The funny thing was
his delivery was quite fluid...

133
00:07:22,412 --> 00:07:24,778
and might have been
convincing...

134
00:07:24,812 --> 00:07:27,877
to someone
who did not know any better.

135
00:07:27,915 --> 00:07:30,761
Who was this Leonard Zelig
that seemed to create...

136
00:07:30,794 --> 00:07:32,681
such diverse impressions
everywhere?

137
00:07:32,714 --> 00:07:36,542
All that was known of him
was that he was the son...

138
00:07:36,584 --> 00:07:39,431
of a Yiddish actor
named Morris Zelig...

139
00:07:39,464 --> 00:07:41,252
whose performance as Puck...

140
00:07:41,287 --> 00:07:44,548
in the Orthodox version of
"A Midsummer Night's Dream"...

141
00:07:44,583 --> 00:07:46,949
was coolly received.

142
00:07:46,982 --> 00:07:48,957
The elder Zelig's
second marriage...

143
00:07:48,998 --> 00:07:52,543
is marked by constant violent
quarreling, so much so...

144
00:07:52,581 --> 00:07:55,428
that although the family
lives over a bowling alley...

145
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:58,526
it's the bowling alley
that complains of noise.

146
00:07:58,563 --> 00:08:02,937
As a boy, Leonard is frequently
bullied by anti-Semites.

147
00:08:02,978 --> 00:08:05,825
His parents,
who never take his part...

148
00:08:05,858 --> 00:08:09,686
and blame him for everything,
side with the anti-Semites.

149
00:08:09,728 --> 00:08:13,502
They punish him often
by locking him in a dark closet.

150
00:08:13,536 --> 00:08:15,423
When they are really angry...

151
00:08:15,455 --> 00:08:18,040
they get into the closet
with him.

152
00:08:18,078 --> 00:08:20,925
On his deathbed,
Morris Zelig tells his son...

153
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:23,804
that life is a meaningless
nightmare of suffering...

154
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:28,724
and the only advice he gives him
is to save string.

155
00:08:28,764 --> 00:08:31,415
Though brother Jack
has a nervous breakdown...

156
00:08:31,451 --> 00:08:34,647
and sister Ruth becomes
a shoplifter and alcoholic...

157
00:08:34,682 --> 00:08:37,977
Leonard Zelig appears
to have adjusted to life.

158
00:08:38,009 --> 00:08:40,791
Somehow, he seems to have coped.

159
00:08:40,825 --> 00:08:46,094
And then, suddenly,
increasingly strange behavior.

160
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,450
Fascinated
by the Zelig phenomenon...

161
00:08:50,486 --> 00:08:53,333
Dr. Fletcher arranges
a series of experiments...

162
00:08:53,365 --> 00:08:56,747
and invites the skeptical staff
to observe.

163
00:08:56,789 --> 00:09:02,385
With the doctors watching, Zelig
becomes a perfect psychiatrist.

164
00:09:02,419 --> 00:09:05,735
When two Frenchmen
are brought in...

165
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:09,520
Zelig assumes their characters
and speaks reasonable French.

166
00:09:09,554 --> 00:09:12,401
In the company
of a Chinese person...

167
00:09:12,433 --> 00:09:15,531
he begins to develop
Oriental features.

168
00:09:15,569 --> 00:09:18,884
By now, word has gotten out
to the press...

169
00:09:18,927 --> 00:09:21,774
and the public, thirsting
for thrills and novelty...

170
00:09:21,806 --> 00:09:24,010
is immediately captivated.

171
00:09:26,894 --> 00:09:29,130
The clamor is so great...

172
00:09:29,165 --> 00:09:32,907
that Dr. Allan Sindell
is forced to issue a statement.

173
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:35,329
We're beginning
to realize the dimensions...

174
00:09:35,372 --> 00:09:38,371
of what could be the scientific
medical phenomenon of the age...

175
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:40,712
and possibly of all time.

176
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:42,983
Fresh stories roll off
the press every day...

177
00:09:43,018 --> 00:09:45,920
about Zelig
and his puzzling condition.

178
00:09:45,961 --> 00:09:49,757
Although the doctors claim
to have the situation in hand...

179
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:53,061
no two can agree
on a diagnosis.

180
00:09:53,095 --> 00:09:55,484
I'm convinced
it's glandular in nature...

181
00:09:55,527 --> 00:09:57,893
and although there's
no evidence of misfunction...

182
00:09:57,926 --> 00:10:01,187
further tests will show
a problem in the secretions.

183
00:10:01,221 --> 00:10:04,352
It's something he picked up
from eating Mexican food.

184
00:10:04,388 --> 00:10:06,754
This manifestation
is neurological in origin.

185
00:10:06,788 --> 00:10:10,103
This patient is suffering
from a brain tumor...

186
00:10:10,147 --> 00:10:14,848
and I should not be surprised
if within several weeks he died.

187
00:10:14,882 --> 00:10:18,678
We have not been able
to locate the tumor...

188
00:10:18,721 --> 00:10:20,509
but we're still looking.

189
00:10:20,545 --> 00:10:23,959
Ironically,
within two weeks' time...

190
00:10:23,999 --> 00:10:27,795
it is Dr. Birsky himself
who dies of a brain tumor.

191
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:30,489
Leonard Zelig is fine.

192
00:10:30,622 --> 00:10:33,556
Throughout the weeks
of testing and speculation...

193
00:10:33,597 --> 00:10:35,419
Eudora Fletcher
begins to feel...

194
00:10:35,453 --> 00:10:37,820
that the patient
might be suffering...

195
00:10:37,852 --> 00:10:39,739
not from
a physiological disorder...

196
00:10:39,772 --> 00:10:42,138
but from a psychological one.

197
00:10:42,172 --> 00:10:45,487
It is Zelig's unstable makeup,
she suggests...

198
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:47,417
that accounts
for his metamorphoses.

199
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:52,206
The governing board of doctors
is hostile to her notion.

200
00:10:52,249 --> 00:10:54,136
They conclude
that Zelig's malady...

201
00:10:54,168 --> 00:10:57,484
can be traced to poor alignment
of the vertebrae.

202
00:10:57,528 --> 00:11:00,080
Tests prove them wrong...

203
00:11:00,119 --> 00:11:02,987
and cause a temporary problem
for the patient.

204
00:11:04,598 --> 00:11:08,874
Now the press and public
hang on every bit of news...

205
00:11:08,917 --> 00:11:11,818
thoroughly absorbed
in the real-life drama.

206
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:15,504
The continuing saga
at Manhattan Hospital goes on.

207
00:11:15,539 --> 00:11:18,572
This morning, doctors report,
experiments were conducted.

208
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:21,806
Several women were placed
in proximity to the subject...

209
00:11:21,841 --> 00:11:23,663
but no change occurred...

210
00:11:23,697 --> 00:11:25,420
leading authorities
to conclude...

211
00:11:25,457 --> 00:11:27,213
that the phenomenon
does not occur with women.

212
00:11:27,248 --> 00:11:31,404
Doctors will experiment
with a midget and a chicken.

213
00:11:37,678 --> 00:11:39,979
Leonard Zelig continues
to astound scientists...

214
00:11:40,013 --> 00:11:42,947
at New York's
Manhattan Hospital...

215
00:11:42,989 --> 00:11:45,257
where numerous tests
have led nowhere...

216
00:11:45,292 --> 00:11:47,909
in determining the nature of
this astonishing manifestation.

217
00:11:47,947 --> 00:11:50,793
He is confronted
by two overweight men...

218
00:11:50,826 --> 00:11:53,192
at the request of the doctors.

219
00:11:53,226 --> 00:11:55,592
As the men
discuss their obesity...

220
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:57,991
an initially reticent Zelig
joins in...

221
00:11:58,025 --> 00:12:01,253
swelling himself
to a miraculous 250 pounds.

222
00:12:01,288 --> 00:12:04,353
Next, in the presence
of two Negro men...

223
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:07,489
Zelig rapidly
becomes one himself.

224
00:12:07,527 --> 00:12:10,111
What will they think of next?

225
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:14,851
Meanwhile, Americans all over
have their own reactions.

226
00:12:14,884 --> 00:12:18,397
I wish I could be Lenny Zelig,
the changing man.

227
00:12:18,436 --> 00:12:20,159
I'd be different people.

228
00:12:20,195 --> 00:12:22,366
Someday my wishes
will come true.

229
00:12:22,402 --> 00:12:26,679
Leonard Zelig is
one of the finest gentlemen...

230
00:12:26,722 --> 00:12:29,088
in the United States of America.

231
00:12:29,121 --> 00:12:32,502
He is the cat's pajamas.

232
00:12:32,545 --> 00:12:34,366
Trying a new approach...

233
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:37,334
Dr. Fletcher places the subject
under hypnosis.

234
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:41,400
Tell me why you assume
the characteristics...

235
00:12:41,438 --> 00:12:43,325
of the person you're with.

236
00:12:43,357 --> 00:12:48,691
- It's safe.
- What do you mean safe?

237
00:12:48,732 --> 00:12:51,579
Safe...

238
00:12:51,612 --> 00:12:54,927
to be like the others.

239
00:12:54,971 --> 00:12:58,767
You want to be safe?

240
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:01,657
I want to be liked.

241
00:13:03,225 --> 00:13:04,631
Probing Zelig's unconscious...

242
00:13:04,665 --> 00:13:07,511
Dr. Fletcher gradually
puts together the pieces...

243
00:13:07,544 --> 00:13:10,543
of Zelig's behavioral puzzle.

244
00:13:10,582 --> 00:13:12,949
Dividing her time
between the hospital...

245
00:13:12,982 --> 00:13:16,910
and the 42nd-Street Library,
she writes her report.

246
00:13:16,949 --> 00:13:19,315
A closed meeting
of doctors listens...

247
00:13:19,349 --> 00:13:23,723
as Dr. Fletcher describes Zelig
as a human chameleon.

248
00:13:23,764 --> 00:13:26,611
Like the lizard
that is endowed by nature...

249
00:13:26,643 --> 00:13:28,465
with a marvelous
protective device...

250
00:13:28,499 --> 00:13:30,832
that enables it
to change color...

251
00:13:30,866 --> 00:13:33,713
and blend in with
its immediate surrounding...

252
00:13:33,745 --> 00:13:35,719
Zelig, too, protects himself...

253
00:13:35,761 --> 00:13:38,760
by becoming
whoever he is around.

254
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,647
The doctors listen,
and their reaction is skeptical.

255
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:43,818
"Impossible," they claim.
"Preposterous."

256
00:13:43,855 --> 00:13:46,702
"If he's a lizard,"
quips one doctor...

257
00:13:46,734 --> 00:13:49,581
"then we shouldn't spend
hospital money feeding him...

258
00:13:49,614 --> 00:13:52,035
"but simply catch him
some flies."

259
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:03,977
We knew we had
a good story this time...

260
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:06,398
because it had everything in it.

261
00:14:06,442 --> 00:14:08,808
It had romance.
It had suspense.

262
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:11,687
This fellow Zelig,
he grew up poor.

263
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,607
My city editor said, "Ted...

264
00:14:13,639 --> 00:14:17,916
"we want this story
on page one every day."

265
00:14:17,959 --> 00:14:21,755
In those days, you'd do anything
to sell papers.

266
00:14:21,798 --> 00:14:24,644
To get a story,
you'd jazz it up...

267
00:14:24,677 --> 00:14:26,978
you'd exaggerate,
play with the truth.

268
00:14:27,012 --> 00:14:29,694
Here was a story.
It was a natural.

269
00:14:29,732 --> 00:14:32,415
You told the truth,
and it sold papers.

270
00:14:32,451 --> 00:14:34,207
It never happened before.

271
00:14:34,242 --> 00:14:36,129
Overnight,
Leonard Zelig has become...

272
00:14:36,162 --> 00:14:38,649
the main topic
of conversation everywhere...

273
00:14:38,689 --> 00:14:41,536
and is discussed with amusement
and wonder.

274
00:14:41,568 --> 00:14:44,884
No social gathering is without
its Leonard Zelig joke...

275
00:14:44,928 --> 00:14:47,775
and in a decade
of popular dance crazes...

276
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:49,629
a new one
sweeps the nation.

277
00:15:59,661 --> 00:16:02,508
What's brown, white,
and yellow with four eyes?

278
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:05,442
Leonard Zelig
at the League of Nations.

279
00:16:05,484 --> 00:16:06,891
Not everyone, however...

280
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:09,345
was entranced
by the human chameleon...

281
00:16:09,387 --> 00:16:11,176
and amongst the fanatics...

282
00:16:11,211 --> 00:16:13,992
he was a handy symbol
of iniquity.

283
00:16:14,026 --> 00:16:18,215
This creature
personifies Capitalist man.

284
00:16:18,249 --> 00:16:23,485
A creature who takes
many forms to achieve ends...

285
00:16:23,528 --> 00:16:28,796
the exploitation of the workers
by deception.

286
00:16:30,438 --> 00:16:33,339
To the Ku Klux Klan, Zelig...

287
00:16:33,381 --> 00:16:36,228
a Jew who was able
to transform himself...

288
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:39,642
into a Negro or Indian,
was a triple threat.

289
00:16:39,684 --> 00:16:41,658
Meanwhile, Dr. Fletcher...

290
00:16:41,699 --> 00:16:44,065
certain that her findings
are correct...

291
00:16:44,099 --> 00:16:46,465
begs for time
with her patient...

292
00:16:46,498 --> 00:16:49,115
to put her theories
into operation.

293
00:16:49,154 --> 00:16:51,608
You recall
the first time you began...

294
00:16:51,649 --> 00:16:55,096
behaving like the people
you were around?

295
00:16:55,136 --> 00:16:58,451
In school,
some very bright people...

296
00:16:58,495 --> 00:17:01,342
asked me if I read "Moby Dick."

297
00:17:02,814 --> 00:17:06,129
I was ashamed to say
I never read it.

298
00:17:06,174 --> 00:17:07,580
And you pretended?

299
00:17:09,053 --> 00:17:12,368
When did the changes
begin happening automatically?

300
00:17:12,412 --> 00:17:14,321
Years ago.

301
00:17:14,363 --> 00:17:15,769
Saint Patrick's Day.

302
00:17:15,803 --> 00:17:18,552
I wandered into a bar.

303
00:17:18,586 --> 00:17:21,488
Wasn't wearing green.

304
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:23,417
They made remarks.

305
00:17:23,449 --> 00:17:25,336
I turned Irish.

306
00:17:25,369 --> 00:17:27,735
You told them you were Irish?

307
00:17:27,768 --> 00:17:31,564
My hair turned red.
My nose turned up.

308
00:17:31,607 --> 00:17:34,508
Spoke about
the great potato famine...

309
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:37,681
and the little people.

310
00:17:37,717 --> 00:17:40,564
We do not agree
with Dr. Fletcher's ideas.

311
00:17:40,597 --> 00:17:43,978
We believe those ideas
are pipe dreams.

312
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:46,866
We believe that any change
in Zelig's condition...

313
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:49,265
is going to be brought about...

314
00:17:49,299 --> 00:17:50,705
through certain
experimental drugs...

315
00:17:50,738 --> 00:17:54,381
which although risky,
have been known to work wonders.

316
00:17:54,418 --> 00:17:57,352
Zelig is treated
with the experimental drug...

317
00:17:57,393 --> 00:17:59,432
somadril hydrate.

318
00:17:59,472 --> 00:18:01,359
He undergoes
severe mood changes...

319
00:18:01,391 --> 00:18:05,994
and for several days
will not come off the wall.

320
00:18:06,031 --> 00:18:08,005
Then suddenly...

321
00:18:08,046 --> 00:18:11,362
as Dr. Fletcher is beginning
to make some progress...

322
00:18:11,405 --> 00:18:13,771
the question of Zelig's fate
takes a new twist...

323
00:18:13,805 --> 00:18:17,546
as his half sister Ruth
removes him from the hospital.

324
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:21,376
"He can be better cared for
at home," she tells the doctors.

325
00:18:21,419 --> 00:18:25,695
He'll be looked after by her
and her lover Martin Geist...

326
00:18:25,738 --> 00:18:29,534
a businessman
and ex-carnival promoter.

327
00:18:29,577 --> 00:18:32,424
There is very little resistance
amongst the doctors...

328
00:18:32,457 --> 00:18:36,198
who are relieved to be rid
of the frustrating case.

329
00:18:36,231 --> 00:18:40,027
Only Dr. Fletcher cares
about Zelig as a human being.

330
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:42,787
She insists he desperately needs
special care...

331
00:18:42,821 --> 00:18:44,609
but it is to no avail.

332
00:18:44,645 --> 00:18:48,441
No one was questioning
her legal right to Zelig.

333
00:18:48,484 --> 00:18:51,331
She was his half sister
and his guardian...

334
00:18:51,363 --> 00:18:54,265
but she had a strange
boyfriend called Geist.

335
00:18:54,307 --> 00:18:58,103
He'd been in jail
for real-estate fraud.

336
00:18:58,146 --> 00:19:00,895
He was selling
the same piece of property...

337
00:19:00,929 --> 00:19:02,816
to a lot of people.

338
00:19:02,849 --> 00:19:05,663
A Delaware Congressman
bought it twice.

339
00:19:05,695 --> 00:19:07,582
The crowds
that line the roads...

340
00:19:07,615 --> 00:19:11,891
to glimpse the human chameleon
tie up traffic for days.

341
00:19:11,934 --> 00:19:14,803
He's a sight to behold
for tourists and children.

342
00:19:14,845 --> 00:19:17,943
People from all over the country
fight for space...

343
00:19:17,981 --> 00:19:20,347
to peek at this new wonderment.

344
00:19:28,923 --> 00:19:30,809
Selling mementos
while her brother...

345
00:19:30,842 --> 00:19:32,980
is allowed
to be on exhibition...

346
00:19:33,018 --> 00:19:36,595
is only the beginning
for Ruth Zelig and Martin Geist.

347
00:19:36,632 --> 00:19:39,381
Admission is charged for
twice-daily demonstrations...

348
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:41,455
of Leonard's stunning prowess.

349
00:19:41,495 --> 00:19:43,382
He does not disappoint...

350
00:19:43,415 --> 00:19:46,262
changing appearance
over and over upon demand.

351
00:19:46,294 --> 00:19:50,090
Overnight, he has become
an attraction, a novelty...

352
00:19:50,133 --> 00:19:52,653
a freak.

353
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:56,652
In this 1935 film
based on the life of Zelig...

354
00:19:56,692 --> 00:19:59,560
called "The Changing Man"...

355
00:19:59,602 --> 00:20:01,489
the atmosphere
is best summed up.

356
00:20:01,522 --> 00:20:04,369
We can't give up
custody of Leonard.

357
00:20:04,401 --> 00:20:06,768
I know, if given the chance,
I can cure him.

358
00:20:06,801 --> 00:20:09,834
Even our attorney
says it's hopeless.

359
00:20:09,872 --> 00:20:12,686
Dr. Fletcher...
may I call you Eudora?

360
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,607
Somewhere behind
that vacuous face...

361
00:20:14,639 --> 00:20:16,046
that zombielike stare...

362
00:20:16,079 --> 00:20:19,787
is a real human being,
and I can bring it out.

363
00:20:19,822 --> 00:20:20,934
How?

364
00:20:20,973 --> 00:20:22,828
Some new way, some technique.

365
00:20:22,861 --> 00:20:26,308
Whatever it is,
it will have to be personal.

366
00:20:26,348 --> 00:20:28,715
There's not much
I can do legally.

367
00:20:28,747 --> 00:20:31,114
They don't care.
They'll exploit him.

368
00:20:31,147 --> 00:20:33,994
They see a chance to make money.

369
00:20:34,026 --> 00:20:36,808
Look. They're selling
this Leonard Zelig doll.

370
00:20:36,842 --> 00:20:38,728
The film did not exaggerate.

371
00:20:38,761 --> 00:20:42,077
There weren't only Leonard Zelig
pens and lucky charms...

372
00:20:42,121 --> 00:20:44,967
but clocks and toys,
watches and books...

373
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,098
and a famous Leonard Zelig doll.

374
00:20:48,135 --> 00:20:49,662
There were aprons,
chameleon-shaped earmuffs...

375
00:20:49,703 --> 00:20:51,939
and a popular
Leonard Zelig game.

376
00:21:35,004 --> 00:21:38,003
There were many popular songs...

377
00:21:38,043 --> 00:21:41,687
inspired by Leonard Zelig,
tunes that swept the nation.

378
00:22:04,053 --> 00:22:06,735
In addition to
the products and endorsements...

379
00:22:06,772 --> 00:22:09,040
there are
the endless exhibitions.

380
00:22:09,075 --> 00:22:11,376
In Hollywood,
he's a great favorite...

381
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:13,930
and is offered a film contract.

382
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:16,816
Clara Bow invites him
for a private weekend...

383
00:22:16,849 --> 00:22:19,499
and tells him to bring
all his personalities.

384
00:22:19,536 --> 00:22:23,180
In Chicago, he meets heavyweight
champion Jack Dempsey...

385
00:22:23,215 --> 00:22:26,062
who clowns with Zelig
at his training camp.

386
00:22:26,095 --> 00:22:28,298
In Washington, D.C.,
he is introduced...

387
00:22:28,334 --> 00:22:31,236
to both Calvin Coolidge
and Herbert Hoover.

388
00:22:31,278 --> 00:22:34,125
In France, he is hailed
as Le Lezard.

389
00:22:34,157 --> 00:22:37,572
He is the toast
of the Parisian music halls.

390
00:22:37,612 --> 00:22:40,458
His performance endears him to
leading French intellectuals...

391
00:22:40,491 --> 00:22:44,135
who see in him
a symbol for everything.

392
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:46,690
His transformation
into a rabbi...

393
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:49,096
is so realistic
that certain Frenchmen...

394
00:22:49,129 --> 00:22:52,706
suggest he be sent
to Devil's Island.

395
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,021
At the Folies Bergere...

396
00:22:57,063 --> 00:23:00,379
Josephine Baker does her version
of the Chameleon Dance...

397
00:23:00,423 --> 00:23:02,244
and later tells friends...

398
00:23:02,278 --> 00:23:05,921
she finds Zelig amazing,
but a little lost.

399
00:23:05,957 --> 00:23:09,087
Everyone used to be
at my place...

400
00:23:09,124 --> 00:23:11,490
everyone who was someone...

401
00:23:11,524 --> 00:23:16,760
and occasionally
someone would bring Zelig in...

402
00:23:16,802 --> 00:23:18,209
Leonard in.

403
00:23:18,242 --> 00:23:22,518
Cole Porter
was fascinated by Leonard...

404
00:23:22,561 --> 00:23:25,876
and he once
wrote a line in a song...

405
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:31,156
"You're the tops.
You're Leonard Zelig."

406
00:23:31,198 --> 00:23:35,670
But then he couldn't find
anything to rhyme with Zelig.

407
00:23:41,533 --> 00:23:43,987
I'm flying high

408
00:23:44,027 --> 00:23:47,093
'Cause I've got a feeling
I'm falling

409
00:23:47,131 --> 00:23:53,556
Falling for nobody else but you

410
00:23:53,593 --> 00:23:55,284
You caught my eye

411
00:23:55,321 --> 00:23:58,703
Now I got a feeling I'm falling

412
00:23:58,744 --> 00:24:03,086
Show me that ring,
and I'll jump right through

413
00:24:03,127 --> 00:24:06,574
I used to travel single, oh

414
00:24:06,614 --> 00:24:09,744
We chanced to mingle, oh

415
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:14,123
Now I'm a-tingle over you

416
00:24:14,165 --> 00:24:17,611
Hey, Mr. Zelig, stand by

417
00:24:17,652 --> 00:24:20,815
'Cause I've got a feeling
I'm falling

418
00:24:20,851 --> 00:24:25,291
Falling for nobody else but you

419
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:26,671
Wow!

420
00:24:26,706 --> 00:24:29,072
Though the shows and parties...

421
00:24:29,105 --> 00:24:32,453
keep Zelig's sister
and her lover rich and amused...

422
00:24:32,496 --> 00:24:34,862
Zelig's own existence
is a nonexistence.

423
00:24:34,895 --> 00:24:36,301
Devoid of personality...

424
00:24:36,335 --> 00:24:40,611
his human qualities long since
lost in the shuffle of life...

425
00:24:40,653 --> 00:24:43,500
he sits alone,
quietly staring into space...

426
00:24:43,533 --> 00:24:48,288
a cipher, a nonperson,
a performing freak.

427
00:24:48,332 --> 00:24:51,647
He who wanted only to fit in,
to belong...

428
00:24:51,691 --> 00:24:55,487
to go unseen by his enemies
and be loved...

429
00:24:55,530 --> 00:24:58,791
neither fits in nor belongs...

430
00:24:58,826 --> 00:25:02,916
is supervised by enemies,
and remains uncared for.

431
00:25:02,952 --> 00:25:07,294
The board at the hospital
has all but forgotten Zelig.

432
00:25:07,335 --> 00:25:10,683
Only Dr. Fletcher continues
to fight for his custody.

433
00:25:10,726 --> 00:25:14,108
The court turns
her final appeal down.

434
00:25:14,149 --> 00:25:16,036
Throughout her valiant
legal battle...

435
00:25:16,069 --> 00:25:20,094
she is frequently in the company
of her attorney Charles Koslow.

436
00:25:20,132 --> 00:25:22,336
He falls in love with her...

437
00:25:22,372 --> 00:25:25,306
and presses
for her hand in marriage.

438
00:25:25,347 --> 00:25:26,754
She is ambivalent.

439
00:25:26,786 --> 00:25:29,153
Reluctantly,
she is beginning to abandon...

440
00:25:29,186 --> 00:25:32,601
all hope of recovering
Leonard Zelig.

441
00:25:32,641 --> 00:25:37,244
That summer,
Geist has booked them in Spain.

442
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:40,574
It is the last leg
of a European tour...

443
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:42,517
that has been wildly successful.

444
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:45,405
Relations between Martin Geist
and Ruth Zelig...

445
00:25:45,438 --> 00:25:47,325
have grown strained.

446
00:25:47,358 --> 00:25:50,204
They have become bored
with one another...

447
00:25:50,237 --> 00:25:51,643
and quarrel frequently.

448
00:25:51,676 --> 00:25:54,992
The situation grows worse
when she meets Luis Martinez...

449
00:25:55,036 --> 00:25:58,002
a mediocre
and cowardly bullfighter...

450
00:25:58,043 --> 00:25:59,952
with whom she falls in love.

451
00:26:01,115 --> 00:26:03,961
Though he wishes
to impress Ruth Zelig...

452
00:26:03,994 --> 00:26:07,157
Martinez displays
his usual panic in the arena.

453
00:26:07,192 --> 00:26:09,396
Good fortune is
with him, however...

454
00:26:09,432 --> 00:26:11,701
as the bull gives himself
a brain concussion.

455
00:26:11,735 --> 00:26:14,102
Martinez takes credit
for the kill...

456
00:26:14,135 --> 00:26:16,338
and cutting off
the bull's ear...

457
00:26:16,375 --> 00:26:19,058
presents it to his lover
with great bravado.

458
00:26:19,094 --> 00:26:21,297
That evening,
in a jealous rage...

459
00:26:21,333 --> 00:26:24,082
Martin Geist returns
to his hotel room...

460
00:26:24,116 --> 00:26:26,123
and confronts Ruth Zelig.

461
00:26:26,164 --> 00:26:29,098
He demands that she
give him the ear.

462
00:26:29,139 --> 00:26:30,448
She refuses.

463
00:26:30,483 --> 00:26:33,329
Geist insists upon
possession of the ear.

464
00:26:33,362 --> 00:26:36,012
They quarrel furiously,
and Martinez is discovered...

465
00:26:36,050 --> 00:26:38,089
hiding in the closet.

466
00:26:38,129 --> 00:26:40,016
Geist pulls a revolver
and shoots him.

467
00:26:40,049 --> 00:26:43,364
He turns the gun on Zelig's
half sister and kills her.

468
00:26:43,407 --> 00:26:45,611
Then he takes his own life.

469
00:26:45,647 --> 00:26:48,167
In an orgy
of jealous violence...

470
00:26:48,206 --> 00:26:51,075
Leonard Zelig's life
is turned upside down.

471
00:27:05,898 --> 00:27:09,923
At first, the news reverberates
around the world.

472
00:27:09,962 --> 00:27:12,100
Then, just as quickly...

473
00:27:12,137 --> 00:27:14,886
the thrill-hungry public
becomes apathetic.

474
00:27:14,921 --> 00:27:17,408
Fresh scandals appear
and make headlines.

475
00:27:17,448 --> 00:27:20,295
Events in the Jazz Age
move too rapidly...

476
00:27:20,327 --> 00:27:22,301
like Red Grange.

477
00:27:22,343 --> 00:27:26,652
A population glutted with
distractions is quick to forget.

478
00:27:26,693 --> 00:27:29,147
The twenties come
to a crashing climax...

479
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:32,057
and still, Leonard Zelig
is nowhere to be found.

480
00:27:36,739 --> 00:27:41,408
Dr. Eudora Fletcher
searches in vain to locate him.

481
00:27:41,442 --> 00:27:43,808
When several leads
prove disappointing...

482
00:27:43,841 --> 00:27:46,361
she gives up, discouraged.

483
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,123
I felt it was a shame.

484
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:50,047
Here was this unique case...

485
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,861
that I could make
my reputation on.

486
00:27:52,895 --> 00:27:55,742
Not that I knew
how to cure him...

487
00:27:55,774 --> 00:27:58,621
but if I could
have him alone...

488
00:27:58,654 --> 00:28:01,969
and feel my way and be
innovative and creative...

489
00:28:02,012 --> 00:28:04,859
I felt that I could
change his life...

490
00:28:04,892 --> 00:28:07,411
if I only had the chance.

491
00:28:15,482 --> 00:28:19,256
300,000 of the faithful are
waiting before St. Peter's...

492
00:28:19,288 --> 00:28:21,524
for the appearance
of Pope Pius XI.

493
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,566
Borne on the shoulders
of twelve attendants...

494
00:28:23,608 --> 00:28:26,454
the seat of the Adjustortoria
carrying the Holy Father...

495
00:28:26,487 --> 00:28:28,374
is drawn out
to the central balcony...

496
00:28:28,406 --> 00:28:31,635
where he bestows his
blessings on all the world.

497
00:28:31,669 --> 00:28:34,124
This is the first time this
ritual has been performed...

498
00:28:34,165 --> 00:28:38,921
in 63 years and brings
to a climax on Easter Sunday...

499
00:28:38,964 --> 00:28:40,851
the religious ceremonies
of Holy Week.

500
00:28:40,883 --> 00:28:44,199
What's this? A commotion
next to the Papal Father?

501
00:28:44,242 --> 00:28:46,129
Somebody doesn't
belong up there.

502
00:28:46,162 --> 00:28:48,048
The guards are summoned
amidst chaos...

503
00:28:48,081 --> 00:28:49,968
as His Holiness Pope Pius XI...

504
00:28:50,001 --> 00:28:52,847
tries to swat the intruder
with his sacred decree.

505
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,767
The faithful can't believe it.

506
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:56,839
It is, of course, Zelig.

507
00:28:56,879 --> 00:28:59,245
He's returned
to the United States...

508
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,613
by Italian authorities...

509
00:29:01,646 --> 00:29:04,613
and readmitted
to Manhattan Hospital.

510
00:29:04,653 --> 00:29:07,686
I welcome this opportunity
to treat Leonard Zelig...

511
00:29:07,724 --> 00:29:12,000
now that he is back
as a ward of the hospital.

512
00:29:12,044 --> 00:29:15,359
I'm grateful the board
has given me this chance.

513
00:29:15,402 --> 00:29:18,249
I sincerely hope
to return him to society...

514
00:29:18,282 --> 00:29:20,168
a useful,
self-possessed citizen...

515
00:29:20,201 --> 00:29:23,997
no longer a curiosity
with no life of his own.

516
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:27,684
Dr. Fletcher has no time now
to think of marriage.

517
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:30,469
All her attention must be
devoted to Leonard Zelig.

518
00:29:30,502 --> 00:29:34,276
Her plan is to bring him
to her country home.

519
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:37,953
She will set up a neutral
environment away from society.

520
00:29:37,989 --> 00:29:42,265
She will begin searching for
some new way to treat him...

521
00:29:42,308 --> 00:29:44,991
in the hopes of penetrating
his unique malady.

522
00:29:45,027 --> 00:29:47,961
Aware of the significance
of her work...

523
00:29:48,003 --> 00:29:50,849
Eudora Fletcher arranges
to keep a filmed record...

524
00:29:50,882 --> 00:29:52,769
of the proceedings.

525
00:29:52,801 --> 00:29:56,597
For this, she contacts
her first cousin Paul Deghuee...

526
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:00,185
an inventor
and part-time photographer.

527
00:30:00,224 --> 00:30:04,794
She said, "I want to make
a record of this case...

528
00:30:04,831 --> 00:30:07,677
"for future generations
and the world of science.

529
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:09,597
"I want you to keep
the camera very quiet."

530
00:30:09,629 --> 00:30:13,906
I said, "Why not just
take notes and write it up?"

531
00:30:13,948 --> 00:30:15,835
She said, "Paul, when a man...

532
00:30:15,867 --> 00:30:19,663
"changes his physical
appearance, you want to see it.

533
00:30:19,706 --> 00:30:21,593
"You can't read about it.

534
00:30:21,626 --> 00:30:24,211
"Besides which,
I am planning to make history."

535
00:30:24,249 --> 00:30:27,216
The white room
is carefully arranged...

536
00:30:27,257 --> 00:30:29,144
for maximum serenity.

537
00:30:29,177 --> 00:30:32,492
It is a small study
in Dr. Fletcher's house...

538
00:30:32,535 --> 00:30:34,422
sparsely furnished.

539
00:30:34,455 --> 00:30:38,251
Clumsy photographic lights
are nailed to the wall...

540
00:30:38,294 --> 00:30:41,806
to provide
sufficient illumination.

541
00:30:41,845 --> 00:30:45,227
Microphones are hidden
in specially selected places.

542
00:30:45,268 --> 00:30:48,399
The camera shoots
through a pane of glass...

543
00:30:48,436 --> 00:30:50,476
which renders it
relatively unobtrusive.

544
00:30:50,516 --> 00:30:53,232
The noise of the motor
is a problem.

545
00:30:53,267 --> 00:30:57,543
This is muffled with a blanket
and anything else handy.

546
00:30:57,586 --> 00:30:59,473
From this cramped
vantage point...

547
00:30:59,506 --> 00:31:01,294
photographer Paul Deghuee
will record...

548
00:31:01,328 --> 00:31:03,695
the famous
White Room Sessions...

549
00:31:03,728 --> 00:31:07,786
a remarkable document
in the history of psychotherapy.

550
00:31:07,823 --> 00:31:09,481
By today's standards...

551
00:31:09,518 --> 00:31:13,314
the White Room Sessions
would seem very primitive...

552
00:31:13,357 --> 00:31:16,673
and yet they were
really quite effective...

553
00:31:16,717 --> 00:31:20,033
in developing a very strong
personal relation...

554
00:31:20,076 --> 00:31:21,985
between doctor and patient.

555
00:31:22,028 --> 00:31:25,322
The question whether
Zelig was a psychotic...

556
00:31:25,355 --> 00:31:28,202
or merely extremely neurotic...

557
00:31:28,234 --> 00:31:31,550
was a question
that was endlessly discussed...

558
00:31:31,593 --> 00:31:33,480
among us doctors.

559
00:31:33,513 --> 00:31:38,268
I myself felt that
his feelings were really...

560
00:31:38,311 --> 00:31:41,093
not all that different
from the normal...

561
00:31:41,127 --> 00:31:42,687
maybe what one would call...

562
00:31:42,727 --> 00:31:44,930
the well-adjusted
normal person...

563
00:31:44,966 --> 00:31:47,333
only carried
to an extreme degree...

564
00:31:47,365 --> 00:31:49,252
to an extreme extent.

565
00:31:49,285 --> 00:31:52,132
I myself felt that one could...

566
00:31:52,164 --> 00:31:55,873
really think of him
as the ultimate conformist.

567
00:31:59,363 --> 00:32:02,232
Leonard, do you know
why you're here?

568
00:32:04,162 --> 00:32:06,049
To discuss psychiatry, right?

569
00:32:06,081 --> 00:32:07,968
You're a doctor?

570
00:32:08,001 --> 00:32:09,888
Yes, I am.

571
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:12,287
Perhaps you've read
my latest paper...

572
00:32:12,319 --> 00:32:14,206
on delusional paranoia.

573
00:32:14,239 --> 00:32:17,085
Turns out
the entire thing is mental.

574
00:32:17,118 --> 00:32:22,354
Suppose I tell you
you're not a doctor.

575
00:32:22,397 --> 00:32:27,633
I would say
that you're making a joke.

576
00:32:27,675 --> 00:32:30,522
Incidentally, is it
always so bright in here?

577
00:32:30,555 --> 00:32:34,351
I'm recording these sessions
on film, if you don't mind.

578
00:32:34,394 --> 00:32:35,800
There's somebody
behind there, right?

579
00:32:35,834 --> 00:32:38,615
That's right.
That's a camera.

580
00:32:40,088 --> 00:32:42,935
Why don't we start
with simple reality.

581
00:32:42,967 --> 00:32:44,854
Leonard, you're not a doctor.

582
00:32:46,327 --> 00:32:49,174
You're a patient,
and I'm the doctor.

583
00:32:49,206 --> 00:32:54,442
I wouldn't tell it to
too many people if I were you.

584
00:32:54,485 --> 00:32:56,851
Leonard, you're not a doctor.

585
00:32:56,885 --> 00:32:59,731
Is she going to be all right?

586
00:32:59,764 --> 00:33:03,079
I've got to get back to town.

587
00:33:03,123 --> 00:33:05,489
Really. I have
an interesting case...

588
00:33:05,522 --> 00:33:07,889
treating two sets
of Siamese twins...

589
00:33:07,921 --> 00:33:09,328
with split personalities.

590
00:33:09,361 --> 00:33:11,019
I'm getting paid
by eight people.

591
00:33:11,057 --> 00:33:14,318
"The first week's sessions
did not go too well..."

592
00:33:14,352 --> 00:33:16,718
writes Dr. Fletcher
in her diary.

593
00:33:16,752 --> 00:33:18,639
"Leonard identifies with me...

594
00:33:18,671 --> 00:33:21,518
"and is convinced
that he is a doctor.

595
00:33:21,551 --> 00:33:23,525
"He is guarded and suspicious.

596
00:33:23,566 --> 00:33:26,315
"There is something
very appealing about him, too.

597
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:28,237
"He's quick-witted
and energetic.

598
00:33:28,269 --> 00:33:31,913
"Perhaps it is his very
helplessness that moves me.

599
00:33:31,948 --> 00:33:35,842
"I must keep flexible
and play the situation by ear."

600
00:33:37,322 --> 00:33:39,231
How are you today, Leonard?

601
00:33:40,682 --> 00:33:44,958
Fine.
I got to get back to town soon.

602
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,367
I teach a course...

603
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:50,716
at the Psychiatric Institute
on masturbation.

604
00:33:50,759 --> 00:33:52,165
I see.

605
00:33:52,199 --> 00:33:54,086
I'm a doctor, and I...

606
00:33:54,119 --> 00:33:56,005
Guilt-related masturbation.

607
00:33:56,038 --> 00:33:58,885
Not guilt-related.
I teach advanced.

608
00:33:58,917 --> 00:34:01,764
I'm quite
a respected doctor there.

609
00:34:01,797 --> 00:34:04,163
Let your eyes follow this pen.

610
00:34:04,196 --> 00:34:07,675
Just let yourself
breathe deeply.

611
00:34:07,715 --> 00:34:09,275
Relax.

612
00:34:09,315 --> 00:34:11,354
You're trying to hypnotize me.

613
00:34:11,394 --> 00:34:14,241
- Do you mind?
- Yes, I mind. I'm a doctor.

614
00:34:14,274 --> 00:34:16,161
You're not a doctor.

615
00:34:16,193 --> 00:34:18,080
I am a doctor.

616
00:34:18,113 --> 00:34:19,519
Just relax.

617
00:34:19,552 --> 00:34:21,439
I can't.
I'm due back in town.

618
00:34:21,471 --> 00:34:23,358
I have this
masturbation class.

619
00:34:23,391 --> 00:34:26,205
If I'm not there,
they start without me.

620
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:28,180
As the weeks go by...

621
00:34:28,222 --> 00:34:31,069
Dr. Fletcher grows
more and more frustrated.

622
00:34:31,102 --> 00:34:33,883
"Leonard continues
to insist he is a doctor...

623
00:34:33,917 --> 00:34:37,232
"and even refuses to let me
hypnotize him," she writes.

624
00:34:37,275 --> 00:34:40,122
"I believe his experiences
of the past year...

625
00:34:40,155 --> 00:34:42,837
"have made him
more defensive than ever.

626
00:34:42,875 --> 00:34:44,184
"It is discouraging."

627
00:34:44,218 --> 00:34:46,040
She was under great pressure.

628
00:34:46,073 --> 00:34:48,920
You could tell.
She was moody and nervous.

629
00:34:48,953 --> 00:34:53,491
He was fine, napping,
sitting in his chair reading.

630
00:34:53,528 --> 00:34:56,375
He referred to himself
as Dr. Zelig.

631
00:34:56,407 --> 00:34:58,828
He was reading
books on psychiatry.

632
00:34:58,871 --> 00:35:02,186
I told her to get away
for a day and relax.

633
00:35:02,229 --> 00:35:04,596
The strain was
becoming too much.

634
00:35:04,629 --> 00:35:06,287
Leaving Zelig alone...

635
00:35:06,324 --> 00:35:08,745
Dr. Fletcher takes
Paul Deghuee's advice...

636
00:35:08,788 --> 00:35:12,748
and she and her fiance
spend some hours off, relaxing.

637
00:35:12,787 --> 00:35:16,680
They go to Broadway, then
to a well-known nightclub...

638
00:35:16,723 --> 00:35:18,991
where, despite
a lively stage show...

639
00:35:19,026 --> 00:35:21,392
Dr. Fletcher
is distracted and uneasy.

640
00:35:21,425 --> 00:35:25,166
She is unable to think
of anything but her patient.

641
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:28,102
The atmosphere with
her fiance Koslow is awkward.

642
00:35:28,143 --> 00:35:32,365
He is put off by her
total obsession with Zelig.

643
00:35:32,398 --> 00:35:35,714
Ironically, it is in the noisy,
smoke-filled atmosphere...

644
00:35:35,758 --> 00:35:38,856
of the nightclub
that Eudora Fletcher...

645
00:35:38,893 --> 00:35:41,958
is struck by a brilliant
and innovative plan...

646
00:35:41,996 --> 00:35:44,865
that will create a major
breakthrough in the case.

647
00:35:52,074 --> 00:35:54,440
Dr. Zelig.

648
00:35:54,473 --> 00:35:58,269
I wonder if you could
help me with a problem.

649
00:35:58,312 --> 00:36:00,199
I could certainly try.

650
00:36:00,231 --> 00:36:02,598
Of course,
we can't promise anything.

651
00:36:02,631 --> 00:36:07,867
Last week, I was with a group
of fairly erudite people...

652
00:36:07,909 --> 00:36:10,756
who were discussing
the novel "Moby Dick."

653
00:36:10,789 --> 00:36:15,577
I was afraid to admit
I hadn't read it, so I lied.

654
00:36:18,467 --> 00:36:21,782
I want so badly to be liked...

655
00:36:21,826 --> 00:36:25,655
to be like other people
so I don't stand out.

656
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,847
That's natural.

657
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:34,228
I go to such extreme
lengths to blend in.

658
00:36:37,598 --> 00:36:42,834
You're a doctor. You should know
how to handle that.

659
00:36:42,877 --> 00:36:45,724
But the truth
of the matter is...

660
00:36:45,756 --> 00:36:49,105
I'm not an actual doctor.

661
00:36:51,515 --> 00:36:53,424
You're not?

662
00:36:54,874 --> 00:36:58,189
I've been pretending
to be a doctor...

663
00:36:58,233 --> 00:37:00,600
to fit in with my friends.

664
00:37:00,632 --> 00:37:02,541
You see, they're doctors.

665
00:37:07,351 --> 00:37:08,779
That's something.

666
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:14,026
But you're a doctor,
and you can help me.

667
00:37:14,069 --> 00:37:15,956
You have to help me.

668
00:37:15,988 --> 00:37:19,304
I don't feel that well,
actually.

669
00:37:19,348 --> 00:37:23,144
My whole life's just been a lie.

670
00:37:23,187 --> 00:37:27,409
I've been posing
as one thing after another.

671
00:37:27,442 --> 00:37:29,329
You need help, lady.

672
00:37:29,362 --> 00:37:32,677
Last night, I dreamt I was
falling into fire.

673
00:37:32,721 --> 00:37:34,608
What does that mean?

674
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,527
That's terrible.
I don't know.

675
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:41,130
Doctor, I know
I'm a complicated patient.

676
00:37:41,167 --> 00:37:43,239
- I don't feel that well.
- What am I suffering from?

677
00:37:43,278 --> 00:37:46,125
How should I know?
I'm not a doctor.

678
00:37:46,157 --> 00:37:47,564
You're not?

679
00:37:47,597 --> 00:37:50,444
- No. Am I?
- Who are you?

680
00:37:50,477 --> 00:37:53,323
What do you mean?
These are tough questions.

681
00:37:53,356 --> 00:37:54,763
Leonard Zelig?

682
00:37:54,795 --> 00:37:56,682
Definitely. Who is he?

683
00:37:56,715 --> 00:37:58,121
You.

684
00:37:58,155 --> 00:38:00,042
I'm nobody. I'm nothing.

685
00:38:00,074 --> 00:38:01,983
I... catch me.
I'm falling.

686
00:38:03,273 --> 00:38:04,996
Playing on
Zelig's identity disorder...

687
00:38:05,033 --> 00:38:06,920
Dr. Fletcher
has manipulated him...

688
00:38:06,953 --> 00:38:08,676
into momentary disorientation.

689
00:38:08,712 --> 00:38:13,021
With his guard lowered, she
quickly puts him under hypnosis.

690
00:38:13,095 --> 00:38:14,883
Using posthypnotic suggestion...

691
00:38:14,919 --> 00:38:18,213
she will now be able
to induce a trance at will.

692
00:38:18,246 --> 00:38:21,114
My brother beat me.

693
00:38:21,157 --> 00:38:24,953
My sister beat my brother.

694
00:38:24,996 --> 00:38:30,232
My father beat my sister
and my brother and me.

695
00:38:30,275 --> 00:38:33,590
My mother beat my father...

696
00:38:33,634 --> 00:38:37,429
and my sister and me
and my brother.

697
00:38:37,473 --> 00:38:40,319
The neighbors beat our family.

698
00:38:40,352 --> 00:38:47,158
People down the block beat
the neighbors and our family.

699
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:49,915
I'm twelve years old.

700
00:38:49,950 --> 00:38:52,796
I run into a synagogue.

701
00:38:52,829 --> 00:38:57,105
I ask the rabbi
the meaning of life.

702
00:38:57,148 --> 00:39:00,944
He tells me
the meaning of life...

703
00:39:00,987 --> 00:39:03,834
but he tells it to me in Hebrew.

704
00:39:03,867 --> 00:39:07,182
I don't understand Hebrew.

705
00:39:07,225 --> 00:39:11,763
Then he wants to charge me
$600 for Hebrew lessons.

706
00:39:11,801 --> 00:39:16,306
Dr. Fletcher's therapy consists
of a two-pronged attack.

707
00:39:16,344 --> 00:39:20,140
In the trance state,
the personality will be...

708
00:39:20,183 --> 00:39:22,004
deeply probed
and then restructured.

709
00:39:22,038 --> 00:39:23,925
In the conscious state...

710
00:39:23,957 --> 00:39:26,324
she will provide
love and affection...

711
00:39:26,357 --> 00:39:28,266
unconditional positive regard.

712
00:39:51,311 --> 00:39:53,198
You will be completely honest.

713
00:39:53,231 --> 00:39:55,118
You're in a deep trance.

714
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:59,906
You will become not who you
think I want you to be...

715
00:39:59,949 --> 00:40:01,836
but you will be yourself.

716
00:40:01,869 --> 00:40:04,737
Now, how do you
feel about it here?

717
00:40:07,147 --> 00:40:09,513
It's the worst.

718
00:40:09,547 --> 00:40:11,913
I hate the country.

719
00:40:11,946 --> 00:40:15,261
I hate the grass
and the mosquitos.

720
00:40:15,305 --> 00:40:17,672
And cooking...

721
00:40:17,704 --> 00:40:20,005
your cooking is terrible.

722
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:21,927
Your pancakes...

723
00:40:21,959 --> 00:40:26,236
I dump them in the garbage
when you're not looking.

724
00:40:27,718 --> 00:40:30,565
And the jokes
you try and tell...

725
00:40:30,597 --> 00:40:34,874
when you think you're amusing
are long and pointless.

726
00:40:34,916 --> 00:40:37,282
There's no end to them.

727
00:40:37,316 --> 00:40:39,203
I see.

728
00:40:39,235 --> 00:40:41,122
And what else?

729
00:40:41,155 --> 00:40:44,983
I want to go to bed with you.

730
00:40:47,873 --> 00:40:50,720
Well, that surprises me.

731
00:40:50,752 --> 00:40:53,599
I didn't think you
liked me very much.

732
00:40:53,632 --> 00:40:55,541
I love you.

733
00:40:57,471 --> 00:40:59,837
You do?

734
00:40:59,870 --> 00:41:01,757
You're very sweet...

735
00:41:01,789 --> 00:41:06,066
because you're not as clever
as you think you are.

736
00:41:06,109 --> 00:41:12,304
You're all mixed up and nervous,
and you're the worst cook.

737
00:41:12,347 --> 00:41:14,713
Those pancakes...

738
00:41:14,747 --> 00:41:17,048
I love you.

739
00:41:17,082 --> 00:41:20,398
I want to take care of you.

740
00:41:20,441 --> 00:41:22,350
No more pancakes.

741
00:41:30,519 --> 00:41:32,242
I started out...

742
00:41:32,406 --> 00:41:35,275
by trying to use Leonard
to make my reputation.

743
00:41:35,318 --> 00:41:39,114
Then I found I had
very strong feelings for him.

744
00:41:39,157 --> 00:41:41,523
I never thought
I was attractive.

745
00:41:41,556 --> 00:41:43,443
I never had a real romance.

746
00:41:43,475 --> 00:41:46,322
Charles Koslow
was the type of man...

747
00:41:46,355 --> 00:41:48,743
my mother felt I should marry.

748
00:41:52,913 --> 00:41:56,392
Feeling more confident
every day with her patient...

749
00:41:56,433 --> 00:41:59,279
Dr. Fletcher takes him
for a cautious outing...

750
00:41:59,312 --> 00:42:03,435
an afternoon at her sister's
house in nearby Teaneck.

751
00:42:03,470 --> 00:42:05,510
Meryl Fletcher
is an aviatrix...

752
00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:07,437
a fine professional pilot.

753
00:42:07,469 --> 00:42:10,316
Eudora Fletcher
is an amateur pilot...

754
00:42:10,349 --> 00:42:12,715
and the afternoon
is spent relaxing...

755
00:42:12,749 --> 00:42:15,497
and retelling
old flying experiences.

756
00:42:17,003 --> 00:42:18,890
As the weeks pass...

757
00:42:18,922 --> 00:42:22,238
Zelig is encouraged
to open up more and more...

758
00:42:22,282 --> 00:42:24,169
to give his own opinions.

759
00:42:24,202 --> 00:42:27,048
What was guarded at first
soon becomes expansive.

760
00:42:27,081 --> 00:42:31,422
I hated my stepmother.
I don't care who knows it.

761
00:42:33,351 --> 00:42:34,758
I love baseball.

762
00:42:34,791 --> 00:42:37,157
It doesn't
have to mean anything.

763
00:42:37,190 --> 00:42:39,579
It's just very beautiful
to watch.

764
00:42:41,637 --> 00:42:45,793
I'm a Democrat.
I always was a Democrat.

765
00:42:47,268 --> 00:42:52,023
Is it OK if I don't agree
with you about that recording?

766
00:42:52,066 --> 00:42:53,953
Of course.

767
00:42:53,986 --> 00:42:57,946
Brahms is just always
too melodramatic for me.

768
00:42:57,985 --> 00:43:00,668
You have to be
your own person...

769
00:43:00,704 --> 00:43:03,071
and make your own
moral choices...

770
00:43:03,104 --> 00:43:05,951
even when they do
require real courage.

771
00:43:05,983 --> 00:43:09,976
Otherwise, you're like
a robot or a lizard.

772
00:43:10,014 --> 00:43:12,599
Are you really going
to marry that lawyer?

773
00:43:12,638 --> 00:43:15,026
I would much rather you didn't.

774
00:43:16,477 --> 00:43:17,883
I don't agree.

775
00:43:17,917 --> 00:43:20,785
I think this guy Mussolini
is a loser.

776
00:43:22,716 --> 00:43:26,326
Are we ever going to make love?

777
00:43:26,362 --> 00:43:27,922
It has been three months...

778
00:43:27,962 --> 00:43:30,809
and the board wishes
to examine the patient.

779
00:43:30,841 --> 00:43:34,637
Dr. Fletcher says Zelig isn't
ready to leave the premises.

780
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:37,047
The doctors agree
to visit him there.

781
00:43:37,079 --> 00:43:39,926
The date is set...
four days hence.

782
00:43:39,959 --> 00:43:41,846
If progress is insufficient...

783
00:43:41,878 --> 00:43:43,787
she will be removed
from the case.

784
00:43:45,782 --> 00:43:49,097
I was very nervous
because in his waking state...

785
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:51,987
he never remembered anything
from his trance state...

786
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:54,386
and I wondered
if there could be some way...

787
00:43:54,419 --> 00:43:56,786
of locking
these two things together.

788
00:43:56,818 --> 00:43:59,185
And then I also was worried...

789
00:43:59,218 --> 00:44:02,065
that if he was
with strong personalities...

790
00:44:02,098 --> 00:44:04,202
he might lose his personality.

791
00:44:04,241 --> 00:44:06,445
Sunday at noon,
the doctors arrive.

792
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:08,847
They are greeted
by Eudora Fletcher...

793
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:12,676
and Leonard Zelig and are shown
around the grounds.

794
00:44:12,719 --> 00:44:15,566
Though Dr. Fletcher
is tense and alert...

795
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:18,445
Leonard Zelig seems calm
and at ease.

796
00:44:18,478 --> 00:44:21,793
Despite the fact that he
is surrounded by physicians...

797
00:44:21,836 --> 00:44:24,203
he does not turn into one.

798
00:44:24,236 --> 00:44:27,083
The encounter appears to be
a resounding success...

799
00:44:27,116 --> 00:44:29,482
when Dr. Henry Mayerson
comments innocently...

800
00:44:29,515 --> 00:44:33,311
about the weather,
saying that it is a nice day.

801
00:44:33,354 --> 00:44:36,669
Zelig tells Dr. Mayerson
that he does not agree...

802
00:44:36,713 --> 00:44:39,080
that it is a nice day.

803
00:44:39,112 --> 00:44:40,999
Dr. Mayerson is taken aback...

804
00:44:41,032 --> 00:44:43,333
at the firmness
of Zelig's conviction.

805
00:44:43,367 --> 00:44:48,123
He points out that the sun
is shining and that it is mild.

806
00:44:48,166 --> 00:44:51,482
Zelig, trained to voice his own
personal opinions fearlessly...

807
00:44:51,525 --> 00:44:53,412
is too aggressive.

808
00:44:53,445 --> 00:44:57,240
He has been molded too far
in the other direction.

809
00:44:57,284 --> 00:44:59,170
He has become
over-opinionated...

810
00:44:59,203 --> 00:45:02,977
and cannot brook any
disagreement with his own views.

811
00:45:03,011 --> 00:45:06,392
I'd taken him too far
in the other direction.

812
00:45:06,433 --> 00:45:09,280
He struck Dr. Mayerson
and several board members...

813
00:45:09,313 --> 00:45:10,719
with a rake.

814
00:45:10,753 --> 00:45:12,640
This wasn't what we wanted...

815
00:45:12,672 --> 00:45:14,941
yet I felt I'd
accomplished something.

816
00:45:14,975 --> 00:45:17,877
If I could have him
two more weeks...

817
00:45:17,919 --> 00:45:20,285
I could do some fine-tuning...

818
00:45:20,318 --> 00:45:23,284
and turn Leonard Zelig
back into his own man.

819
00:45:33,339 --> 00:45:36,568
Dr. Eudora Nesbit Fletcher,
the hero...

820
00:45:36,602 --> 00:45:38,489
or should we say, heroine...
of the hour.

821
00:45:38,522 --> 00:45:40,823
The beautiful and brilliant
young psychiatrist...

822
00:45:40,857 --> 00:45:43,224
never lost faith
in her conviction...

823
00:45:43,256 --> 00:45:45,143
that Leonard Zelig,
the human chameleon...

824
00:45:45,176 --> 00:45:47,063
was suffering
from a mental disorder.

825
00:45:47,095 --> 00:45:48,469
Working with her cousin...

826
00:45:48,503 --> 00:45:50,990
cameraman Paul Deghuee,
the doctor managed...

827
00:45:51,030 --> 00:45:52,917
to keep a vital record
of the proceedings...

828
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:56,178
including rare footage
of Zelig hypnotized.

829
00:45:56,214 --> 00:45:59,115
The patient and healer
have become fast friends...

830
00:45:59,157 --> 00:46:01,044
and enjoy
one another's company...

831
00:46:01,077 --> 00:46:03,923
even when she's
not working on him.

832
00:46:03,956 --> 00:46:06,803
The result of maintaining
a minority opinion...

833
00:46:06,835 --> 00:46:08,842
is a resounding success
for psychiatry.

834
00:46:08,882 --> 00:46:11,915
Who says women
are just good for sewing?

835
00:46:11,953 --> 00:46:13,295
Now it's on to City Hall...

836
00:46:13,329 --> 00:46:15,216
where the town's
newest celebrities...

837
00:46:15,249 --> 00:46:16,874
are given the key to the city.

838
00:46:16,912 --> 00:46:18,734
We're honored to present...

839
00:46:18,768 --> 00:46:21,517
this key
to New York City to you.

840
00:46:24,047 --> 00:46:26,894
Jimmy Walker
did want to be here...

841
00:46:26,926 --> 00:46:31,235
and sing "Leonard the Lizard,"
but he was just too busy.

842
00:46:33,996 --> 00:46:36,003
After city hall,
Eudora Fletcher...

843
00:46:36,043 --> 00:46:38,345
the beautiful genius
who cured Zelig...

844
00:46:38,379 --> 00:46:40,266
of his science-defying
condition...

845
00:46:40,299 --> 00:46:44,095
is honored by fellow scientists
at New York's Waldorf-Astoria.

846
00:46:44,138 --> 00:46:46,984
Present are luminaries
from all over the world...

847
00:46:47,017 --> 00:46:49,864
not just in the field
of psychiatry...

848
00:46:49,896 --> 00:46:52,743
but physics, biology,
mathematics, and you name it.

849
00:46:52,776 --> 00:46:55,458
Here she is exchanging theories
with Nils Andersen...

850
00:46:55,495 --> 00:46:57,883
the father
of modern blood disease.

851
00:46:57,926 --> 00:47:00,347
Later in the week,
Dr. Fletcher is again honored...

852
00:47:00,389 --> 00:47:03,236
as she gets to christen
her first ship.

853
00:47:03,269 --> 00:47:06,050
Quite a success story
for a little girl...

854
00:47:06,085 --> 00:47:07,579
from the backwoods.

855
00:47:11,396 --> 00:47:12,802
I'm speaking to you...

856
00:47:12,835 --> 00:47:15,289
from the home of
Mrs. Catherine Fletcher.

857
00:47:15,331 --> 00:47:18,177
She's the mother
of Dr. Eudora Fletcher...

858
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:21,057
the famous psychiatrist
in the news these days.

859
00:47:21,089 --> 00:47:24,885
I'll be asking Mrs. Fletcher...
to begin with...

860
00:47:24,928 --> 00:47:27,775
to tell us something
about what it's like...

861
00:47:27,807 --> 00:47:30,654
to raise a medical genius.

862
00:47:30,687 --> 00:47:33,533
I might ask you about
the many sacrifices...

863
00:47:33,566 --> 00:47:36,827
You've made to put your daughter
through medical school.

864
00:47:36,861 --> 00:47:39,227
Speak right into
the microphones, please.

865
00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:41,235
Sacrifices, we had none.

866
00:47:41,276 --> 00:47:44,504
John was a stockbroker.
We had plenty of money...

867
00:47:44,539 --> 00:47:46,905
and I came from a wealthy
Philadelphia family.

868
00:47:46,939 --> 00:47:50,582
I'm sure that your daughter
always wanted to be a doctor...

869
00:47:50,617 --> 00:47:52,657
ever since she could remember.

870
00:47:52,697 --> 00:47:54,584
I don't think so.

871
00:47:54,617 --> 00:47:57,932
I always thought she
wanted to be a flier...

872
00:47:57,975 --> 00:48:00,822
like her sister Meryl,
and raise a family...

873
00:48:00,855 --> 00:48:02,742
but she was a very moody child.

874
00:48:02,774 --> 00:48:05,621
But a mother always
dreams for her child...

875
00:48:05,653 --> 00:48:08,020
to have the success
your daughter has.

876
00:48:08,053 --> 00:48:10,420
She was a very difficult girl.

877
00:48:10,452 --> 00:48:12,339
Tell me about your husband.

878
00:48:12,372 --> 00:48:13,778
I understand that he is
a simple businessman.

879
00:48:13,812 --> 00:48:15,699
He must be so thrilled
and pleased...

880
00:48:15,732 --> 00:48:19,527
to have his daughter
achieve such recognition.

881
00:48:19,571 --> 00:48:22,886
John had problems... depression.
He drank.

882
00:48:22,929 --> 00:48:25,776
Well, Mrs. Fletcher,
thank you so much...

883
00:48:25,809 --> 00:48:28,525
for speaking with us today.

884
00:48:36,207 --> 00:48:38,628
Here at San Simeon,
glorious dreamland...

885
00:48:38,670 --> 00:48:41,157
of newspaper mogul
William Randolph Hearst...

886
00:48:41,197 --> 00:48:45,091
celebrities from all walks
of society sun or play.

887
00:48:45,132 --> 00:48:47,914
There's Marie Dressler
with Mr. Hearst.

888
00:48:47,947 --> 00:48:50,794
Always a popular guest
at San Simeon...

889
00:48:50,827 --> 00:48:54,623
Miss Dressler accepts a flower
from an ardent admirer.

890
00:48:54,666 --> 00:48:57,512
Along with her is Marion Davies.

891
00:48:57,545 --> 00:49:00,861
When she works, Miss Davies
is always dead serious...

892
00:49:00,905 --> 00:49:03,271
But here,
at this fabulous playground...

893
00:49:03,304 --> 00:49:06,172
She shows us her fun side.

894
00:49:06,215 --> 00:49:09,629
There she is with
you-know-who... Charlie Chaplin...

895
00:49:09,670 --> 00:49:11,644
always kidding.

896
00:49:11,686 --> 00:49:14,685
Although New York
is 3,000 miles away...

897
00:49:14,725 --> 00:49:18,434
Jimmy Walker appears through
Mr. Hearst's enchanted gateway.

898
00:49:18,468 --> 00:49:21,882
Another New Yorker
is Leonard Zelig...

899
00:49:21,924 --> 00:49:23,811
here shown clowning...

900
00:49:23,843 --> 00:49:26,210
with everybody's
favorite cowboy... Tom Mix.

901
00:49:26,242 --> 00:49:28,129
Won't Tony be jealous?

902
00:49:28,162 --> 00:49:30,779
Tony is Tom's horse...

903
00:49:30,817 --> 00:49:33,631
and we always thought
they went everywhere together.

904
00:49:33,664 --> 00:49:35,835
There's that fellow
Chaplin again...

905
00:49:35,871 --> 00:49:38,326
this time with Adolphe Menjou.

906
00:49:38,367 --> 00:49:42,425
There's Claire Windsor
and Delores del Rio...

907
00:49:42,462 --> 00:49:44,949
and a very charming
Eudora Fletcher...

908
00:49:44,990 --> 00:49:47,836
chatting with Hollywood's
newest dancing sensation...

909
00:49:47,869 --> 00:49:49,756
James Cagney.

910
00:49:49,788 --> 00:49:52,155
And what have we here?

911
00:49:52,187 --> 00:49:55,154
Only a beautiful lady
named Carole Lombard.

912
00:49:55,195 --> 00:49:57,464
There's Dr. Fletcher
and Leonard Zelig...

913
00:49:57,498 --> 00:50:01,775
hitting a few with Bobby Jones
on Mr. Hearst's golf course.

914
00:50:01,818 --> 00:50:05,614
Unless Leonard can go back to
his old chameleon personality...

915
00:50:05,657 --> 00:50:10,412
and turn into a golf pro,
I'd bet my money on Bobby.

916
00:50:10,456 --> 00:50:13,324
But who cares,
if they're having fun?

917
00:50:18,421 --> 00:50:23,276
Do you want to give the kids
of this country some advice?

918
00:50:23,316 --> 00:50:26,632
I sure do.
Kids, you got to be yourself.

919
00:50:26,676 --> 00:50:28,497
Don't act like anybody else...

920
00:50:28,531 --> 00:50:31,312
because you think
they have all the answers.

921
00:50:31,346 --> 00:50:35,273
Be your own man, speak up,
say what's on your mind.

922
00:50:35,314 --> 00:50:38,160
Maybe they can't do that
in foreign countries...

923
00:50:38,193 --> 00:50:40,080
but that's the American way.

924
00:50:40,112 --> 00:50:43,908
I used to be a member
of the reptile family...

925
00:50:43,951 --> 00:50:45,860
but I'm not anymore.

926
00:51:28,740 --> 00:51:32,035
Zelig, no longer a chameleon,
is his own man.

927
00:51:32,067 --> 00:51:35,383
His point of view
on politics, art, and love...

928
00:51:35,427 --> 00:51:38,274
is honest and direct.

929
00:51:38,306 --> 00:51:41,622
Though his taste is described
by many as lowbrow...

930
00:51:41,665 --> 00:51:43,552
it is his own.

931
00:51:43,584 --> 00:51:46,431
He is finally an individual,
a human being.

932
00:51:46,464 --> 00:51:49,310
He no longer gives up
his own identity...

933
00:51:49,343 --> 00:51:52,691
to be a safe part
of his surroundings.

934
00:51:52,734 --> 00:51:54,621
His taste wasn't terrible.

935
00:51:54,654 --> 00:51:57,500
He was a man who preferred
watching baseball...

936
00:51:57,533 --> 00:51:59,420
to reading "Moby Dick"...

937
00:51:59,453 --> 00:52:02,768
and that got him off
on the wrong foot...

938
00:52:02,811 --> 00:52:04,698
or so the legend goes.

939
00:52:04,731 --> 00:52:07,097
It was much more
a matter of symbolism.

940
00:52:07,131 --> 00:52:09,977
To the Marxists
he was one thing.

941
00:52:10,010 --> 00:52:12,376
The Catholic Church
never forgave him...

942
00:52:12,409 --> 00:52:13,816
for the Vatican incident.

943
00:52:13,849 --> 00:52:15,256
The American people...

944
00:52:15,288 --> 00:52:18,604
in the throes of the Depression
as they were...

945
00:52:18,648 --> 00:52:21,495
found in him a symbol
of possibility...

946
00:52:21,527 --> 00:52:23,828
of self-improvement
and self-fulfillment.

947
00:52:23,863 --> 00:52:26,710
And of course,
the Freudians had a ball.

948
00:52:26,742 --> 00:52:30,058
They could interpret him
in any way they pleased.

949
00:52:30,101 --> 00:52:31,988
It was all symbolism...

950
00:52:32,020 --> 00:52:35,914
but no two intellectuals
agreed about what it meant.

951
00:52:35,955 --> 00:52:38,410
I don't know if you can call it
a triumph of psychotherapy.

952
00:52:38,451 --> 00:52:41,298
It's more like a triumph
of aesthetic instincts.

953
00:52:41,330 --> 00:52:43,697
Dr. Fletcher's techniques
didn't owe anything...

954
00:52:43,729 --> 00:52:46,096
to then-current schools
of therapy...

955
00:52:46,129 --> 00:52:49,445
but she sensed what was needed
and provided it.

956
00:52:49,488 --> 00:52:51,375
That was, in its way...

957
00:52:51,407 --> 00:52:53,349
a remarkable
creative accomplishment.

958
00:52:53,391 --> 00:52:55,846
When I think about it,
it seems to me his story...

959
00:52:55,887 --> 00:52:59,203
reflected a lot of the
Jewish experience in America...

960
00:52:59,246 --> 00:53:03,522
the great urge to push in
and to find one's place...

961
00:53:03,565 --> 00:53:06,412
and then to assimilate
into the culture.

962
00:53:06,444 --> 00:53:08,997
He wanted to assimilate
like crazy.

963
00:53:16,361 --> 00:53:19,360
Eudora Fletcher's
life has also changed...

964
00:53:19,401 --> 00:53:20,807
from this experience.

965
00:53:20,841 --> 00:53:23,688
For her, fame and recognition
are empty rewards...

966
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:27,036
and do not live up
to the adolescent fantasies...

967
00:53:27,079 --> 00:53:29,217
that prompted her ambition.

968
00:53:29,254 --> 00:53:32,069
She and her patient
have fallen in love...

969
00:53:32,102 --> 00:53:34,949
and it is no surprise
when she forsakes...

970
00:53:34,981 --> 00:53:36,868
the upwardly-mobile
attorney Koslow...

971
00:53:36,901 --> 00:53:39,934
and announces wedding plans
with Zelig.

972
00:54:32,055 --> 00:54:35,983
It was wonderful to see
my sister and Leonard together.

973
00:54:36,022 --> 00:54:39,337
She drew strength from him.

974
00:54:39,381 --> 00:54:43,658
And they were so much in love
with each other...

975
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:47,976
and she looked happier
than she had in years.

976
00:54:48,019 --> 00:54:53,255
I remember they decided
to get married in the spring...

977
00:54:53,298 --> 00:54:57,126
and then, of course,
the roof fell in.

978
00:54:58,641 --> 00:55:00,583
Two weeks before the wedding...

979
00:55:00,624 --> 00:55:03,787
an ex-showgirl
named Lita Fox comes forth...

980
00:55:03,823 --> 00:55:07,139
and claims that
she is married to Zelig.

981
00:55:07,183 --> 00:55:10,499
She also claims
to have had his child.

982
00:55:10,542 --> 00:55:13,410
It is an immediate scandal.

983
00:55:16,429 --> 00:55:18,403
We were married a year ago.

984
00:55:18,444 --> 00:55:22,720
He said he was an actor.
He sounded just like one.

985
00:55:22,763 --> 00:55:24,650
I'm in show business, too.

986
00:55:24,682 --> 00:55:27,529
We drove to Baltimore,
and we were married...

987
00:55:27,562 --> 00:55:30,179
and I have a license
to prove it.

988
00:55:30,217 --> 00:55:33,533
He had married her while under
a different personality.

989
00:55:33,576 --> 00:55:35,942
When she read of the plans...

990
00:55:35,976 --> 00:55:37,863
for his forthcoming wedding
to Eudora Fletcher...

991
00:55:37,896 --> 00:55:41,277
she was mortified and
decided to take legal action.

992
00:55:41,318 --> 00:55:44,100
Zelig says he will
fight it in court...

993
00:55:44,134 --> 00:55:48,224
but public opinion begins
subtly to shift away from him.

994
00:55:48,260 --> 00:55:52,220
Clever attorneys portray
Lita Fox as an abandoned woman.

995
00:55:52,259 --> 00:55:56,514
The child is neglected, poor,
and fatherless.

996
00:55:56,546 --> 00:55:59,360
Zelig has sold his life story
to Hollywood...

997
00:55:59,394 --> 00:56:01,695
for a large sum of money.

998
00:56:01,730 --> 00:56:03,671
When the scandal breaks...

999
00:56:03,712 --> 00:56:06,079
the studio demands
its money back.

1000
00:56:06,112 --> 00:56:09,275
Zelig can only return half.
The rest has been spent.

1001
00:56:09,312 --> 00:56:12,606
Outraged, the studio gives him
half his life back.

1002
00:56:12,639 --> 00:56:14,526
They keep the best moments.

1003
00:56:14,558 --> 00:56:18,835
He is left with only his
sleeping hours and mealtimes.

1004
00:56:18,877 --> 00:56:23,186
Zelig is shaken by the scandal,
but it is only the beginning.

1005
00:56:23,228 --> 00:56:25,137
Now another woman
steps forward.

1006
00:56:25,180 --> 00:56:29,140
Helen Gray, a salesgirl
from a Wisconsin gift shop...

1007
00:56:29,178 --> 00:56:32,494
claims that Zelig
is the father of her twins.

1008
00:56:32,538 --> 00:56:37,294
She tells lawyers that he passed
himself off as a fur trapper.

1009
00:56:37,337 --> 00:56:39,703
Zelig has no recollection,
but admits...

1010
00:56:39,736 --> 00:56:43,532
it could have happened
during one of his spells.

1011
00:56:43,575 --> 00:56:45,614
It's the signal
for the floodgates to open.

1012
00:56:45,654 --> 00:56:49,101
He married me
at the First Church of Harlem.

1013
00:56:49,142 --> 00:56:51,824
He told me he was the brother
of Duke Ellington.

1014
00:56:51,861 --> 00:56:55,209
He was the guy
who smashed my car up.

1015
00:56:55,252 --> 00:56:57,139
It was brand-new.

1016
00:56:57,172 --> 00:57:00,018
Then he backed up
over my mother's wrist.

1017
00:57:00,051 --> 00:57:04,807
She's elderly
and uses her wrist a lot.

1018
00:57:04,850 --> 00:57:07,664
He painted my house
a disgusting color.

1019
00:57:07,697 --> 00:57:10,064
He said he was a painter.

1020
00:57:10,096 --> 00:57:12,714
I couldn't believe the results.

1021
00:57:12,752 --> 00:57:15,239
Then he disappeared.

1022
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:17,189
That Zelig
could be responsible...

1023
00:57:17,231 --> 00:57:20,077
for the behavior of
each personality he assumed...

1024
00:57:20,110 --> 00:57:22,662
means dozens of lawsuits.

1025
00:57:22,702 --> 00:57:25,035
He is sued
for bigamy, adultery...

1026
00:57:25,069 --> 00:57:27,916
automobile accidents,
plagiarism, household damages...

1027
00:57:27,948 --> 00:57:30,468
negligence, property damages...

1028
00:57:30,507 --> 00:57:33,922
and performing unnecessary
dental extractions.

1029
00:57:33,963 --> 00:57:36,864
I would like to apologize
to everyone.

1030
00:57:36,906 --> 00:57:39,753
I'm awfully sorry
for marrying all those women.

1031
00:57:39,786 --> 00:57:41,673
It just... I don't know.

1032
00:57:41,705 --> 00:57:44,552
It just seemed
like the thing to do.

1033
00:57:44,584 --> 00:57:47,431
To the gentleman
whose appendix I took out...

1034
00:57:47,464 --> 00:57:49,830
I don't know what to say.

1035
00:57:49,863 --> 00:57:51,750
If it's any consolation...

1036
00:57:51,782 --> 00:57:54,149
I may still have it
somewhere around the house.

1037
00:57:54,182 --> 00:57:58,458
My deepest apology goes to
the Trokman family in Detroit.

1038
00:57:58,501 --> 00:58:01,816
I never delivered
a baby before in my life...

1039
00:58:01,860 --> 00:58:07,042
and I just thought that
ice tongs was the way to do it.

1040
00:58:07,074 --> 00:58:10,718
Thriving mercilessly on
loopholes and technicalities...

1041
00:58:10,754 --> 00:58:14,234
the American legal profession
has a field day.

1042
00:58:14,273 --> 00:58:16,160
Zelig is branded a criminal.

1043
00:58:16,193 --> 00:58:19,039
Despite Dr. Fletcher's
insistence that he cannot be...

1044
00:58:19,072 --> 00:58:22,551
held responsible for actions
while in his chameleon state...

1045
00:58:22,591 --> 00:58:23,965
it is no use.

1046
00:58:23,998 --> 00:58:27,958
Leonard Zelig sets
a bad moral influence.

1047
00:58:27,997 --> 00:58:30,844
America is a moral country.

1048
00:58:30,877 --> 00:58:34,520
It's a God-fearing country.

1049
00:58:34,556 --> 00:58:40,981
We don't condone scandals...
scandals of fraud and polygamy.

1050
00:58:41,018 --> 00:58:47,475
In keeping with a pure society,
I say, lynch the little Hebe.

1051
00:58:48,504 --> 00:58:50,391
Throughout
the humiliating ordeal...

1052
00:58:50,424 --> 00:58:54,863
Eudora Fletcher stands by
the man she loves, valiantly.

1053
00:58:54,903 --> 00:58:56,790
Privately, she tells friends...

1054
00:58:56,823 --> 00:58:59,670
that she is worried about
Zelig's emotional condition...

1055
00:58:59,702 --> 00:59:02,549
which seems to her
to be deteriorating...

1056
00:59:02,581 --> 00:59:05,777
under the weight
of conservative moral opinion.

1057
00:59:05,813 --> 00:59:08,594
In public, he tries to keep up
an appearance of composure...

1058
00:59:08,628 --> 00:59:10,449
but it is increasingly
difficult.

1059
00:59:10,483 --> 00:59:13,450
It is clear that
he is coming apart...

1060
00:59:13,491 --> 00:59:16,806
when he and Eudora dine
at a Greek restaurant...

1061
00:59:16,849 --> 00:59:21,704
and in the midst of the meal,
Zelig begins to turn Greek.

1062
00:59:26,511 --> 00:59:29,358
He longs desperately
to be liked once again...

1063
00:59:29,391 --> 00:59:32,205
to be accepted, to fit in.

1064
00:59:32,237 --> 00:59:35,368
Public clamor over his morality
reaches a fever pitch...

1065
00:59:35,405 --> 00:59:38,252
and on the eve
of his sentencing...

1066
00:59:38,285 --> 00:59:40,423
Leonard Zelig vanishes.

1067
00:59:47,083 --> 00:59:50,660
This is Chief Inspector
of Police Thomas Dowd...

1068
00:59:50,697 --> 00:59:53,152
with a national
broadcasting news break.

1069
00:59:53,193 --> 00:59:55,080
Leonard Zelig is missing.

1070
00:59:55,113 --> 00:59:57,479
On the eve of his sentencing...

1071
00:59:57,511 --> 01:00:00,478
for an assortment
of crimes and misdemeanors...

1072
01:00:00,519 --> 01:00:03,202
ranging from polygamy to fraud,
he has disappeared.

1073
01:00:03,238 --> 01:00:05,125
We are searching for clues...

1074
01:00:05,158 --> 01:00:07,524
and would appreciate
speaking with anyone...

1075
01:00:07,557 --> 01:00:11,200
who might have any information
leading to his apprehension.

1076
01:00:11,236 --> 01:00:14,050
My sister was just shattered.

1077
01:00:14,083 --> 01:00:18,839
She tried to keep up
a calm front...

1078
01:00:18,882 --> 01:00:21,249
but she was just too upset.

1079
01:00:21,282 --> 01:00:23,169
And she wasn't a person...

1080
01:00:23,202 --> 01:00:26,048
who usually
displayed emotion easily...

1081
01:00:26,081 --> 01:00:28,469
except where Leonard
was concerned.

1082
01:00:31,584 --> 01:00:34,682
Dr. Fletcher and the police
confer daily.

1083
01:00:34,719 --> 01:00:36,606
Together they make
public appeals...

1084
01:00:36,638 --> 01:00:39,485
to anyone who might know
of his whereabouts.

1085
01:00:39,518 --> 01:00:41,884
Apart from several
crank telephone calls...

1086
01:00:41,917 --> 01:00:43,672
there is little response.

1087
01:00:43,709 --> 01:00:47,003
Months go by,
and Zelig is not heard from.

1088
01:00:47,036 --> 01:00:48,442
Cars are searched.

1089
01:00:48,475 --> 01:00:51,158
False leads pour in
from everywhere.

1090
01:00:51,194 --> 01:00:53,582
His jacket is recovered
in Texas.

1091
01:00:53,626 --> 01:00:56,472
A manhunt in that state
proves futile.

1092
01:00:56,505 --> 01:00:59,701
He is reported seen
in Chicago, in California.

1093
01:00:59,736 --> 01:01:03,412
This still photo appears
to have a man resembling him...

1094
01:01:03,448 --> 01:01:05,836
with a mariachi band in Mexico.

1095
01:01:09,174 --> 01:01:12,075
Dr. Fletcher continues
to search for Zelig...

1096
01:01:12,117 --> 01:01:14,964
but hopes fade
with each passing day.

1097
01:01:14,996 --> 01:01:18,312
All I could think of
was Leonard...

1098
01:01:18,356 --> 01:01:21,203
how much I missed him
and loved him...

1099
01:01:21,235 --> 01:01:24,082
and all the terrific times
we'd spent together.

1100
01:01:24,115 --> 01:01:27,627
It was really
a very painful time for me.

1101
01:01:27,665 --> 01:01:31,974
The year ends,
and Zelig is still missing.

1102
01:01:35,216 --> 01:01:37,549
I just moped around and wept.

1103
01:01:37,583 --> 01:01:40,430
And one night
after a very bad time...

1104
01:01:40,462 --> 01:01:42,829
my sister Meryl said to me...

1105
01:01:42,862 --> 01:01:45,709
"Come on, let's go out
for dinner or a concert."

1106
01:01:45,742 --> 01:01:49,537
I said, "No. I can't do it,"
but she insisted.

1107
01:01:49,581 --> 01:01:52,776
We went out
and ended up in a movie.

1108
01:01:52,812 --> 01:01:56,291
We saw "Grand Hotel," and
with it, there was a newsreel.

1109
01:02:05,768 --> 01:02:08,637
Adolf Hitler and
the National Socialist Party...

1110
01:02:08,679 --> 01:02:11,526
continue to consolidate gains
in depression-ridden Berlin.

1111
01:02:11,558 --> 01:02:13,762
Denouncing
the Treaty of Versailles...

1112
01:02:13,798 --> 01:02:17,375
the Nazis make fervent appeals
to German patriotism...

1113
01:02:17,414 --> 01:02:21,122
Eudora Fletcher is stunned
by what she sees.

1114
01:02:21,156 --> 01:02:23,043
Amongst the brown shirts...

1115
01:02:23,076 --> 01:02:25,922
she spots a figure
who could be Zelig.

1116
01:02:25,955 --> 01:02:29,270
Then it made all
the sense in the world...

1117
01:02:29,314 --> 01:02:32,161
because although
he wanted to be loved...

1118
01:02:32,194 --> 01:02:34,081
craved to be loved...

1119
01:02:34,113 --> 01:02:36,480
there was also
something in him...

1120
01:02:36,512 --> 01:02:40,439
that desired immersion
in the mass and anonymity.

1121
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:43,610
And Fascism offered Zelig
that kind of opportunity...

1122
01:02:43,647 --> 01:02:47,923
so that he could make something
anonymous of himself...

1123
01:02:47,966 --> 01:02:52,438
by belonging
to this vast movement.

1124
01:02:52,476 --> 01:02:55,824
She sails for
Europe the following week.

1125
01:02:55,868 --> 01:02:58,714
Ten days later,
she arrives in Berlin.

1126
01:02:58,747 --> 01:03:03,023
Germany is a country deep
in the throes of the Depression.

1127
01:03:03,066 --> 01:03:06,448
Militarism and unrest
are in the air.

1128
01:03:06,489 --> 01:03:08,910
She searches everywhere
and makes inquiries...

1129
01:03:08,952 --> 01:03:10,381
but it is impossible.

1130
01:03:10,424 --> 01:03:11,766
After three weeks...

1131
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:14,166
the authorities begin
to get suspicious.

1132
01:03:14,199 --> 01:03:15,606
They watch her.

1133
01:03:15,639 --> 01:03:18,955
While she is out,
they search her hotel room.

1134
01:03:18,998 --> 01:03:20,852
A fourth week goes by...

1135
01:03:20,886 --> 01:03:23,187
and she is about
to give up and go home...

1136
01:03:23,221 --> 01:03:27,498
when news of a large rally
at Munich catches her attention.

1137
01:03:27,540 --> 01:03:29,427
It is rumored
that it will be...

1138
01:03:29,459 --> 01:03:32,306
the largest gathering to date
of Nazi personnel.

1139
01:03:32,339 --> 01:03:34,542
Eudora Fletcher
is counting on the hope...

1140
01:03:34,578 --> 01:03:39,596
that Zelig may attend and that
if she can confront him...

1141
01:03:39,633 --> 01:03:44,073
the strong feeling he has always
had for her can be awakened.

1142
01:03:44,112 --> 01:03:46,500
At first, all appears hopeless.

1143
01:03:46,543 --> 01:03:48,452
The crowd is huge.

1144
01:03:48,495 --> 01:03:51,941
It seems impossible to locate
any one particular face.

1145
01:04:06,155 --> 01:04:09,002
Then suddenly, a figure flanking
the chancellor...

1146
01:04:09,034 --> 01:04:10,659
catches her attention.

1147
01:04:10,698 --> 01:04:15,137
Behind and to the right
of Hitler, she spots Zelig.

1148
01:04:15,176 --> 01:04:19,070
Struggling to make contact,
she manages to catch his eye.

1149
01:04:19,111 --> 01:04:23,420
Like a man emerging
from a dream, Zelig notices her.

1150
01:04:23,462 --> 01:04:27,739
In a matter of seconds,
everything comes back to him.

1151
01:05:23,767 --> 01:05:26,222
It was nothing like
it happened in the movie.

1152
01:05:26,263 --> 01:05:30,637
When Leonard left the podium,
they didn't know what to think.

1153
01:05:30,678 --> 01:05:32,620
We couldn't believe our eyes.

1154
01:05:32,661 --> 01:05:34,548
Hitler's speech was ruined.

1155
01:05:34,581 --> 01:05:38,224
He wanted to make
a good joke about Poland...

1156
01:05:38,260 --> 01:05:42,536
but just then,
Zelig interfered...

1157
01:05:42,579 --> 01:05:46,375
and Hitler was extremely upset.

1158
01:05:46,418 --> 01:05:52,080
The SS wanted to grab Zelig...

1159
01:05:52,113 --> 01:05:54,959
but if they would have
grabbed him...

1160
01:05:54,992 --> 01:05:57,838
they probably would have
tortured him...

1161
01:05:57,871 --> 01:06:00,237
or maybe even shot him.

1162
01:06:00,271 --> 01:06:01,678
So in the confusion...

1163
01:06:01,710 --> 01:06:05,026
Fletcher and Zelig
got out of the building...

1164
01:06:05,070 --> 01:06:06,957
through a side door.

1165
01:06:06,989 --> 01:06:10,305
They grabbed a car,
sped away in the car...

1166
01:06:10,348 --> 01:06:13,064
and the SS after them,
shot them.

1167
01:06:14,060 --> 01:06:16,001
In rare
German newsreel footage...

1168
01:06:16,042 --> 01:06:18,911
a quick glimpse of the escape
was recorded.

1169
01:06:32,358 --> 01:06:35,205
I was flying.
It was wonderful.

1170
01:06:35,238 --> 01:06:37,604
And then suddenly,
something happened.

1171
01:06:37,638 --> 01:06:40,004
I was frightened.
I lost control.

1172
01:06:40,037 --> 01:06:41,923
We went into a dive.

1173
01:06:41,956 --> 01:06:46,014
Leonard was so terrified that
he changed his personality...

1174
01:06:46,051 --> 01:06:49,847
and before my eyes,
because I was a pilot...

1175
01:06:49,890 --> 01:06:51,995
he turned into one, too.

1176
01:06:52,034 --> 01:06:54,684
Zelig takes control
of the airplane.

1177
01:06:54,722 --> 01:06:56,609
Acting the role of pilot...

1178
01:06:56,641 --> 01:06:59,096
he struggles valiantly
with the aircraft.

1179
01:06:59,136 --> 01:07:02,997
The Germans, who are stunned,
take a full fifteen minutes...

1180
01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:05,756
before following
in hot pursuit of their quarry.

1181
01:07:05,791 --> 01:07:07,798
With Eudora Fletcher
unconscious...

1182
01:07:07,838 --> 01:07:10,685
Zelig, who had never flown
before in his life...

1183
01:07:10,717 --> 01:07:13,084
not only escapes
the German pilots...

1184
01:07:13,117 --> 01:07:16,913
but sets a record for flying
nonstop across the Atlantic...

1185
01:07:16,956 --> 01:07:18,385
upside down.

1186
01:07:38,679 --> 01:07:41,013
With a storm of cheers
and a blizzard of ticker tape...

1187
01:07:41,046 --> 01:07:43,729
New York welcomes back
Eudora Fletcher...

1188
01:07:43,765 --> 01:07:46,285
and Leonard Zelig,
the human chameleon.

1189
01:07:46,325 --> 01:07:50,153
His remarkable feat of aviation
fills the nation with pride...

1190
01:07:50,196 --> 01:07:52,716
and earns him
a full presidential pardon.

1191
01:07:52,755 --> 01:07:54,348
Forgiving multitudes
flock to see him...

1192
01:07:54,387 --> 01:07:57,201
as he sits by the side
of his plucky bride-to-be.

1193
01:07:57,234 --> 01:07:59,208
Their journey of triumph
leads to City Hall.

1194
01:07:59,249 --> 01:08:02,096
New York's greatest honor,
the Medal of Valor...

1195
01:08:02,129 --> 01:08:04,975
is bestowed on Zelig
by Carter Dean.

1196
01:08:05,008 --> 01:08:09,741
You are a great inspiration
to the young of this nation...

1197
01:08:09,775 --> 01:08:12,141
who will one day grow up...

1198
01:08:12,174 --> 01:08:15,021
and be great doctors
and great patients.

1199
01:08:22,731 --> 01:08:24,618
This was a great thrill.

1200
01:08:24,651 --> 01:08:27,498
I'm glad we lived
to see this day.

1201
01:08:27,530 --> 01:08:30,377
Right. I've never flown
before in my life...

1202
01:08:30,409 --> 01:08:33,256
and it shows exactly
what you can do...

1203
01:08:33,289 --> 01:08:35,198
if you're a total psychotic.

1204
01:08:39,848 --> 01:08:42,149
The thing was paradoxical...

1205
01:08:42,183 --> 01:08:45,498
because what enabled him to
perform this astounding feat...

1206
01:08:45,542 --> 01:08:49,022
was his ability
to transform himself.

1207
01:08:49,061 --> 01:08:53,817
Therefore, his sickness was also
at the root of his salvation...

1208
01:08:53,860 --> 01:08:57,656
and I think it's interesting
to view the thing that way.

1209
01:08:57,699 --> 01:09:03,546
It was his very disorder
that made a hero of him.

1210
01:09:03,586 --> 01:09:06,520
It was really absurd in a way.

1211
01:09:06,561 --> 01:09:09,408
I mean, he had
this curious quirk...

1212
01:09:09,441 --> 01:09:11,164
this strange characteristic.

1213
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:13,566
And for a time,
everyone loved him...

1214
01:09:13,599 --> 01:09:15,965
and then people
stopped loving him.

1215
01:09:15,999 --> 01:09:18,845
Then he did this stunt
with the airplane...

1216
01:09:18,878 --> 01:09:21,244
and then everybody
loved him again.

1217
01:09:21,277 --> 01:09:24,124
And that was what
the twenties were like.

1218
01:09:24,156 --> 01:09:27,701
When you think about it,
has America changed so much?

1219
01:09:27,740 --> 01:09:29,627
I don't think so.

1220
01:09:29,660 --> 01:09:34,099
After untangling
countless legal details...

1221
01:09:34,138 --> 01:09:37,454
Leonard Zelig
and Eudora Fletcher marry.

1222
01:09:37,497 --> 01:09:41,555
It is a simple ceremony
captured on home movies.

1223
01:09:59,636 --> 01:10:03,596
"Wanting only to be liked,
he distorted himself...

1224
01:10:03,635 --> 01:10:06,155
"beyond measure,"
wrote Scott Fitzgerald.

1225
01:10:06,194 --> 01:10:09,193
"One wonders what would have
happened if at the outset...

1226
01:10:09,234 --> 01:10:13,989
"he had had the courage to speak
his mind and not pretend.

1227
01:10:14,032 --> 01:10:17,960
"In the end, it was, after all,
not the approbation of many...

1228
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:22,636
"but the love of one woman
that changed his life."
