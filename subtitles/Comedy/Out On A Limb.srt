00:00:43,777 --> 00:00:47,377
MISS CLAYTON:  <i>Okay,</i>
<i>find a seat. Sit down, please.</i>

2
00:00:48,515 --> 00:00:52,645
<i>My name is Miss Clayton,</i>
<i>and I'm your new teacher.</i>

3
00:00:52,653 --> 00:00:54,493
<i>And since today's</i>
<i>our first day together,</i>

4
00:00:54,488 --> 00:00:56,518
<i>I think we should get</i>
<i>to know one another.</i>

5
00:00:56,524 --> 00:01:00,634
So I'm gonna ask each
of you to tell us about
your summer vacation.

6
00:01:01,528 --> 00:01:03,358
Who wants to start?

7
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:10,669
What's your name?

8
00:01:10,671 --> 00:01:12,441
Priscilla Johnson.

9
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:15,140
You want to tell us about
your vacation, Priscilla?

10
00:01:15,142 --> 00:01:16,442
I got the measles.

11
00:01:16,444 --> 00:01:18,414
Oh, the measles.
That's too bad.

12
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:20,752
Was that at the beginning
of vacation or the end?

13
00:01:20,748 --> 00:01:22,408
The beginning.

14
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:24,146
Well, good. Then you had
all of August to rest up.

15
00:01:24,151 --> 00:01:25,551
What did you do in August?

16
00:01:25,553 --> 00:01:26,723
I got the mumps.

17
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:27,850
You didn't.

18
00:01:27,855 --> 00:01:30,415
I did.
But it was okay.

19
00:01:30,424 --> 00:01:33,834
It was a neat vacation
with lots of presents.

20
00:01:33,828 --> 00:01:35,828
And everyone
was very nice to me.

21
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:37,430
Oh, good.

22
00:01:37,431 --> 00:01:39,631
Except Daddy got nervous
when he got the mumps.

23
00:01:39,633 --> 00:01:41,803
(LAUGHING)

24
00:01:41,802 --> 00:01:43,772
But aside from that,
it was great.

25
00:01:44,571 --> 00:01:46,111
Is that all?

26
00:01:46,107 --> 00:01:47,367
Isn't that enough?

27
00:01:47,841 --> 00:01:49,541
Sure. Yes.

28
00:01:49,543 --> 00:01:51,413
Thanks, Priscilla.

29
00:01:51,412 --> 00:01:53,382
And what's your name?

30
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:56,721
Elliot Field.

31
00:01:56,717 --> 00:01:58,247
Go ahead, Elliot.
We're listening.

32
00:01:58,852 --> 00:02:01,422
I went to summer camp.

33
00:02:01,422 --> 00:02:03,622
Okay. What'd you do
at summer camp?

34
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:07,885
We threw cottage cheese
at each other.

35
00:02:07,895 --> 00:02:10,125
(CHILDREN LAUGHING)

36
00:02:10,663 --> 00:02:11,803
And then what?

37
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:15,567
Ketchup.

38
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:17,339
(CHILDREN LAUGHING)

39
00:02:17,338 --> 00:02:20,868
And aside from having
food fights, did you
do anything interesting?

40
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:25,709
No, but that
was interesting.

41
00:02:25,713 --> 00:02:28,883
Yes, it was.
Thank you, Elliot.

42
00:02:28,883 --> 00:02:31,783
And let's see.
What's your name?

43
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:33,889
Marci Campbell.

44
00:02:33,888 --> 00:02:36,258
Tell us about
your vacation, Marci.

45
00:02:36,257 --> 00:02:39,487
Well, during my vacation,
my brother lost his job,

46
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:41,633
my mom almost
lost her mind

47
00:02:41,629 --> 00:02:44,159
and my stepfather
was murdered
by his twin brother.

48
00:02:45,765 --> 00:02:48,265
What kind of story
is that, Marci?

49
00:02:48,269 --> 00:02:50,639
It's not a story.
It's the truth.

50
00:02:50,638 --> 00:02:52,198
It happened in Buzzsaw.

51
00:02:52,206 --> 00:02:54,266
That's a little
town up north.

52
00:02:54,275 --> 00:02:56,635
My stepfather
was the mayor.

53
00:02:56,644 --> 00:02:58,544
I don't remember
any story about a mayor

54
00:02:58,546 --> 00:03:01,576
being murdered
by his twin brother.

55
00:03:01,582 --> 00:03:05,222
Okay, Marci, go ahead.
Tell your story,
we're listening.

56
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:08,322
It was a dark night.

57
00:03:08,322 --> 00:03:11,422
Actually, it was a dark
and stormy night.

58
00:03:12,293 --> 00:03:18,203
<i>A big truck came to my</i>
<i>stepfather's lumberyard.</i>

59
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:20,869
<i>A very big truck.</i>

60
00:03:26,973 --> 00:03:29,743
<i>And in the truck</i>
<i>was a killer.</i>

61
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:33,210
<i>His name</i>
<i>was Matt Skearns</i>

62
00:03:33,214 --> 00:03:36,284
<i>and he was very tall</i>
<i>like my stepfather</i>

63
00:03:36,283 --> 00:03:38,983
<i>and very ugly</i>
<i>like my stepfather.</i>

64
00:03:38,986 --> 00:03:42,846
<i>And he couldn't see</i>
<i>without his glasses,</i>
<i>like my stepfather.</i>

65
00:03:44,457 --> 00:03:47,387
<i>But that was normal,</i>

66
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:49,934
<i>because he was</i>
<i>his twin brother.</i>

67
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:05,711
<i>Matt Skearns had come bak</i>
<i>to town to get his reven.</i>

<i>He'd been in jail for 15 yeas</i>
<i>for a crime he didn't commit,</i>

69
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:12,550
<i>so you can imagine</i>
<i>how mad he was.</i>

70
00:04:12,553 --> 00:04:15,423
(SCREAMING)

71
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:25,402
<i>Matt had an accomplice,</i>
<i>Virgil,</i>

72
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:27,329
<i>a man he'd met in prison.</i>

73
00:04:27,334 --> 00:04:30,744
<i>Virgil was mean too,</i>
<i>but not as mean as Mat.</i>

74
00:04:30,738 --> 00:04:34,008
Yo, four eyes.
You're late, four eyes.

75
00:04:34,008 --> 00:04:35,838
Don't call me that.

76
00:04:35,843 --> 00:04:38,813
So, how are the boys
in the joint?

77
00:04:38,812 --> 00:04:41,352
They don't miss me
and they sure as hell
don't miss you.

78

(SCOFFS) Now here's
the phone number.

79
00:04:44,952 --> 00:04:49,692
And the name is Van Der Haven.
Mayor Van Der Haven.

80
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,460
Good luck.
I'll meet you
tomorrow night.

81
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,741
MARCI:  <i>I couldn't sleep</i>
<i>because of the storm,</i>

82
00:05:03,737 --> 00:05:06,937
<i>so I was relaxing</i>
<i>and watching a funny</i>
<i>movie on TV</i>

83
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:09,371

<i>Who is this?</i>

90

91
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:30,602
Ah, hold on.

92
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:44,412
Matt, how nice
to hear from you
after all these years.

93
00:05:44,411 --> 00:05:49,081
I want $150,000,
tomorrow,

94
00:05:49,083 --> 00:05:50,783
<i>at your lumberyard!</i>

95

$150,000?

96
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:56,958
Okay, okay.

97
00:05:56,957 --> 00:05:59,117
You'll get your goddamn
money, you little shit!

98
00:05:59,126 --> 00:06:01,356
Just keep your end
of the bargain.

99

If I ever see
or hear from you again,

100

kill you! Understand?

Wow.

109
00:06:43,937 --> 00:06:46,707
Are you watching too many
horror movies, Marci?

110
00:06:46,707 --> 00:06:48,567
No, why?

111
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:51,705
Well, one thing's
for sure. You have
a very active imagination.

112
00:06:51,712 --> 00:06:54,512
This isn't imagination.
It's the truth.

113

Are there
any comments?

Yes?

115
00:07:00,821 --> 00:07:04,961
It may be too soon to judge,
but I have to say
I'm really not convinced.

116
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:08,458
It's so overstated,
so melodramatic.

117
00:07:08,462 --> 00:07:10,802
I'm sorry, Julius,
I disagree.

118
00:07:10,798 --> 00:07:13,028
So far,
it works for me.

119
00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:17,803
It's the most outrageous
summer vacation I've
heard in years.

120
00:07:17,805 --> 00:07:19,035
Should I go on?

121
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,669
ALL: Yeah!

Go ahead, Marci.

123
00:07:24,645 --> 00:07:28,105
I needed help.
I needed it fast.

124
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:30,775
Only one person
to turn to.

All right.
Odds for a hundred.

130
00:07:43,896 --> 00:07:46,966
Damn, every time.
Evens for 200.

Do you read minds?

It's a question of
reorientation, Steve.

I know what you're
gonna do before you know
what you're gonna do.

Jerry Beck had a
heart attack last night.

My God,
he's only 36.

136
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:03,819
34. No time
for condolences.

137
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:06,017
You're taking over
Daisy Cellular deal.

138
00:08:06,019 --> 00:08:09,749
Background,
two days ago, Daisy's C.O.
Leonard Hathaway dropped dead.

139
00:08:09,756 --> 00:08:13,826
Controlling stocks slipped
into hands of Julie Holland,
niece, must sell.

140
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:15,487
Jerry was to meet today.

141
00:08:15,496 --> 00:08:17,026
Decided to have
heart attack instead.

142
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:19,760
Such poor judgment
will cost Jerry.

143
00:08:19,766 --> 00:08:21,126
You will take this meeting.

144
00:08:21,134 --> 00:08:22,534
How much me offer?

145
00:08:22,536 --> 00:08:23,736
160 million ceiling.

146
00:08:23,737 --> 00:08:26,637
I want it bad.
Really bad.

147
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:30,540
Watch out. Travis of
Travis, Jacoby and Travis
is doing the legal.

148
00:08:30,544 --> 00:08:31,614
The elder Travis?

149
00:08:31,612 --> 00:08:34,612
Yes, Count Dracula
himself.

150
00:08:34,615 --> 00:08:35,905
Big bonus if you win.

151
00:08:40,119 --> 00:08:41,889
Let's play poker.

152
00:08:43,122 --> 00:08:44,992
I got a figure in
the back of my mind.

153
00:08:44,992 --> 00:08:46,932
Let's see how close
you can get to it.

154
00:08:47,593 --> 00:08:48,993
A hundred million.

155
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:54,600
If we auctioned it off,
it'll get done at 175.

156
00:08:54,601 --> 00:08:57,271
(SCOFFS) Maybe
five years ago.

157
00:08:57,271 --> 00:08:59,001
Not with a market
this unstable.

158
00:08:59,672 --> 00:09:00,942
160.

159
00:09:02,276 --> 00:09:06,706
Excuse me, Mr. Travis.
Telephone call for you.

160
00:09:07,847 --> 00:09:09,007
Excuse me.

161
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:15,022
It's too bad we have
to go through all this.

162
00:09:15,022 --> 00:09:17,722
It's just gonna
get done at 140.

163
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:19,164
How's that?

164
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:21,129
Oh, Travis is gonna
come back in here.

165
00:09:21,128 --> 00:09:23,958
He's gonna say that the two
of you have to go somewhere.

166
00:09:23,964 --> 00:09:26,974
That's supposed to make me
think he's got another offer.

167
00:09:26,967 --> 00:09:28,327
Watch this.

168
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:34,938
I'm terribly sorry,
but something important
has come up.

169
00:09:34,942 --> 00:09:36,142
Julie.

170
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:50,217
I'd be willing

until they got back,

would be a kidnapping.

00:31:39,198 --> 00:31:40,358
Good night, Mom.

508
00:32:43,094 --> 00:32:44,394
Hey, Matt.
Matt?

509
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:48,027
My name's Peter
Van Der Haven.
Who are you?

510
00:32:48,033 --> 00:32:50,573
(SCOFFS) Don't give
me that crap, Matt.

511
00:32:50,569 --> 00:32:52,599
I figured you'd try
and double-cross me.

512
00:32:52,604 --> 00:32:56,044
(CHUCKLES)
You've got
the wrong man.

513
00:32:56,041 --> 00:32:59,181
Get off my property or
I'll call the police.

514
00:32:59,178 --> 00:33:01,378
Hey, four eyes.
I told you
not to...

515
00:33:04,048 --> 00:33:07,278
Well, that's very good.
That's very smart, Virgil.

516
00:33:08,186 --> 00:33:11,586
So, where's
the money?

517
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:15,260
He didn't have it,
so I had to kill him.

518
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:17,630
VIRGIL: Son of a bitch!
What are we supposed
to do now?

519
00:33:17,629 --> 00:33:19,559
MATT: I'll tell you
what I'm gonna do now.

520
00:33:19,565 --> 00:33:24,295
I'm gonna go into
that house and I'm gonna
become Peter Van Der Haven.

521
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:28,613
And you are gonna lay low.

522
00:33:28,607 --> 00:33:31,307
And when the time comes,
you're gonna get
your 10 percent.

523
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:32,610
Now get!

524
00:33:32,611 --> 00:33:36,181
Ten percent?
It's 50/50, Matt.

525
00:33:36,181 --> 00:33:39,181
Who the hell told you
your brother was the mayor
of Buzzsaw anyway, huh?

526
00:33:39,184 --> 00:33:40,624
Who told you? It was me!

527
00:33:40,619 --> 00:33:43,649
I'm the mayor of Buzzsaw,
and this is the new deal!

528
00:33:43,655 --> 00:33:46,685
Oh, no! No, Matt!
What are you doing?

529
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:52,030
Bill! Bill!
Guess what?

530
00:33:52,031 --> 00:33:55,231
Peter's dead and his
twin brother killed him
and took his place!

531
00:33:55,234 --> 00:33:57,774
Hold on. Marci,
it's very late,
and I'm busy.

532
00:33:57,770 --> 00:34:02,410
And he killed
this other guy, too.
I saw it on my wall!

533
00:34:02,408 --> 00:34:04,368
I think you're
having a bad dream.

534
00:34:04,376 --> 00:34:06,536
No.
Yes, and you should
go to sleep.

535
00:34:06,545 --> 00:34:08,545
But...
We'll talk in the morning.
It's okay.

536

Go ahead, go to sleep.

Yeah, Marci?

Peter's twin brother
went into the closet twice
instead of the bathroom

and sat at the wrong seat
at the table and Dudley took

You remember when
you were on your

the house in Oakland
was a landing spot

622
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:40,740
for those creatures
from the planet Arkanon?

623
00:39:40,746 --> 00:39:44,046
It wasn't a landing
spot. It was where
they came to meet.

624

Do you know the reason
that I never saw the
Arkanese space invaders?

the real reason
that I never saw them?

Why?

627
00:39:53,425 --> 00:39:55,725
Because I am from
the planet Arkanon.

628
00:39:55,727 --> 00:39:58,157

and my mission is...
