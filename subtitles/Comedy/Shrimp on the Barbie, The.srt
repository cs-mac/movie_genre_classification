1
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:30,596
<i>So rare to find</i>

2
00:00:30,597 --> 00:00:32,019
<i>A friend like you</i>

3
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,979
<i>Somehow when you're around</i>

4
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:39,799
<i>The sky is always blue</i>

5
00:00:39,872 --> 00:00:43,103
<i>The way we talk</i>
<i>The things you say</i>

6
00:00:43,175 --> 00:00:46,372
<i>The way you make it all okay</i>

7
00:00:46,445 --> 00:00:49,744
<i>And how you know</i>
<i>All of my jokes</i>

8
00:00:49,815 --> 00:00:52,875
<i>But you laugh anyway</i>

9
00:00:53,619 --> 00:00:55,742
<i>If I could wish</i>

10
00:00:55,743 --> 00:00:56,747
<i>For one thing</i>

11
00:00:56,822 --> 00:00:59,986
<i>I'd take the smile</i>
<i>That you bring</i>

12
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:03,120
<i>Wherever you go</i>
<i>In this world</i>

13
00:01:03,196 --> 00:01:05,596
<i>I'll come along</i>

14
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,036
<i>Together we dream</i>
<i>The same dream</i>

15
00:01:10,103 --> 00:01:13,869
<i>Forever I'm here for you</i>
<i>You're here for me</i>

16
00:01:15,475 --> 00:01:20,242
<i>Two voices</i>
<i>One song</i>

17
00:01:23,016 --> 00:01:25,484
I really like
that Teresa.

18
00:01:25,552 --> 00:01:29,352
And for the bridge,
let's try E-flat for two bars,

19
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:32,118
then D-flat then
back to A-flat.

20
00:01:32,192 --> 00:01:34,786
Yeah, nice.
Let's try it.

21
00:01:41,902 --> 00:01:44,029
I never wanna see her again.

22
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:46,265
She's so not my
friend anymore.

23
00:01:46,339 --> 00:01:47,863
Hey, Stacie.

24
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:49,636
Had a fight
with Courtney?

25
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:51,836
You mean the
backstabber?

26
00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:55,080
You're best friends.
Can't you two work it out?

27
00:01:56,283 --> 00:01:58,547
What's the point of
even having friends?

28
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:00,313
They just
turn on you.

29
00:02:00,587 --> 00:02:02,282
Not real friends.

30
00:02:02,355 --> 00:02:04,824
Real friends care even
if you make a mistake.

31
00:02:05,326 --> 00:02:09,262
Yeah, right. I think they
let you down when it counts.

32
00:02:10,164 --> 00:02:12,928
You're not the only
person to think that.

33
00:02:13,301 --> 00:02:16,828
I know a story about best
friends who thought that, too.

34
00:02:17,071 --> 00:02:20,438
Of course, they lived in a
world with good and bad magic,

35
00:02:20,508 --> 00:02:23,807
flying serpents and
a diamond castle.

36
00:02:24,312 --> 00:02:25,904
Yeah...

37
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:28,972
One day, they had
a terrible fight.

38
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:30,779
That's what put them
in danger.

39
00:02:31,452 --> 00:02:32,885
What happened?

40
00:02:33,187 --> 00:02:36,281
Well, it started with music.

41
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:38,958
Music?
What do you mean?

42
00:02:39,594 --> 00:02:41,323
They loved
to sing together.

43
00:02:41,395 --> 00:02:42,794
Like Teresa
and I do.

44
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:46,590
<i>If I could wish for one thing</i>

45
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:49,830

49

50

<i>Two voices</i>
<i>One song</i>

51
00:03:11,126 --> 00:03:13,526
<i>And anywhere you are</i>

52
00:03:13,595 --> 00:03:16,462
<i>You know I'll be around</i>

53
00:03:17,633 --> 00:03:20,033
<i>And when you call my name</i>

54
00:03:20,102 --> 00:03:25,597
<i>I'll listen for the sound</i>

55
00:03:26,074 --> 00:03:28,096
<i>If I could wish</i>

56
00:03:28,097 --> 00:03:29,134

63
00:03:47,396 --> 00:03:54,029
<i>Two voices</i>
<i>One song</i>

64
00:03:56,171 --> 00:03:58,162
I really like that.

65
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,605
So do I.

66
00:03:59,675 --> 00:04:02,007
It sounds magical
somehow.

67
00:04:03,445 --> 00:04:06,278
Everything sounds
magical to you, Alexa.

68
00:04:06,348 --> 00:04:08,544
That's because
I believe in magic.

69
00:04:08,618 --> 00:04:10,210
And wishes.

70
00:04:10,286 --> 00:04:12,413
And dreams
that come true?

71
00:04:12,488 --> 00:04:14,683
Always dreams
that come true.

72
00:04:14,757 --> 00:04:17,351
Good, then it's your
night to do the dishes.

73
00:04:17,427 --> 00:04:18,451
What?

74
00:04:18,528 --> 00:04:20,223
My dream
come true.

75
00:04:20,296 --> 00:04:23,527
You know, Liana,
I also believe in witches.

76
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,730
Evil witches who chase
unsuspecting girls

77
00:04:26,803 --> 00:04:28,270
with soapy dish cloths.

78
00:04:37,447 --> 00:04:39,074
Alexa, look.

79
00:04:39,449 --> 00:04:40,438
What?

80
00:04:40,516 --> 00:04:41,881
Come here.

81
00:04:46,889 --> 00:04:49,016
Oh, watch out for
that slippery spot.

82
00:04:51,361 --> 00:04:52,885
Now, look.

83
00:04:55,465 --> 00:04:57,399
They're beautiful.

84
00:04:58,167 --> 00:05:00,397
Two perfect hearts.

85
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:04,864
They are perfect.

86
00:05:04,941 --> 00:05:06,238
They almost look...

87
00:05:06,309 --> 00:05:07,537
Magical?

88
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:08,770
Precisely.

89
00:05:08,845 --> 00:05:11,576
I think they
look pretty magical, too.

90
00:05:11,648 --> 00:05:14,446
What if we made
them into necklaces?

91
00:05:14,518 --> 00:05:17,419
Necklaces that have the
secret power to grant...

92
00:05:17,488 --> 00:05:18,477
A wish!

93
00:05:18,555 --> 00:05:19,817
Exactly.

94
00:05:20,157 --> 00:05:22,284
Best friends today.

95
00:05:22,393 --> 00:05:23,758
Tomorrow.

96
00:05:23,827 --> 00:05:25,692
And always.

97
00:05:31,001 --> 00:05:32,434
What is it?

98
00:05:32,569 --> 00:05:37,063
My stomach's growling and all
we have at home is bread and jam.

99
00:05:39,777 --> 00:05:41,142
Whoa!

100
00:05:47,117 --> 00:05:48,709
Flowers.

101
00:06:03,667 --> 00:06:05,692
I don't like
this, Liana.

102
00:06:30,929 --> 00:06:33,227
Do you think it'll be over soon?

103
00:06:33,765 --> 00:06:36,563
Maybe if you wish
on something magical.

104
00:06:38,169 --> 00:06:40,899
Liana, it's beautiful.

105
00:06:44,509 --> 00:06:45,771
I love it.

106
00:06:45,844 --> 00:06:47,175
What about yours?

107
00:06:48,213 --> 00:06:49,771
The perfect match.

108
00:07:31,624 --> 00:07:33,353
Oh, Liana...

109
00:07:33,826 --> 00:07:35,521
I know.

110
00:07:36,028 --> 00:07:38,553
Well, let's salvage
what we can.

111
00:07:46,939 --> 00:07:49,533
That's it. All the
flowers we have.

112
00:07:49,608 --> 00:07:51,872
Even if we sell them all,
the money will never last us

113
00:07:51,944 --> 00:07:53,844
until next
growing season.

114
00:07:53,979 --> 00:07:56,277
Of course it will.
It has to.

115
00:07:57,316 --> 00:07:59,113
Now what would
you like for lunch?

116
00:07:59,184 --> 00:08:01,311
Looks like we have

117
00:08:01,387 --> 00:08:03,446
bread and jam or

118
00:08:03,522 --> 00:08:04,921
jam and bread.

119
00:08:05,758 --> 00:08:09,524
You know what I would wish for,
if these stones were really magic?

120
00:08:09,695 --> 00:08:12,960
More. More food than
we can possible eat,

121
00:08:13,032 --> 00:08:15,557
more house than we
could ever explore,

122
00:08:15,634 --> 00:08:17,864
more clothes than
we could ever wear.

123
00:08:17,937 --> 00:08:21,135
Then we'd never have to worry
about another thing ever again.

124
00:08:21,308 --> 00:08:23,640
Except how insufferable we'd be.

125
00:08:23,843 --> 00:08:27,939
"Butler, I can't possibly wear
all these beautiful dresses.

126
00:08:28,014 --> 00:08:29,606
"It's horrible."

127
00:08:29,683 --> 00:08:31,651
"How dare those princes invite me

128
00:08:31,718 --> 00:08:34,346
"to five different balls
on the same night?

129
00:08:34,421 --> 00:08:36,582
"I can't possibly
go to all of them."

130
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:41,152
Good day,
ma'am.

131
00:08:41,227 --> 00:08:43,491
And to you, Miss.

132
00:08:47,133 --> 00:08:48,225
She looks...

133
00:08:48,301 --> 00:08:49,427
Starving.

134
00:08:50,437 --> 00:08:52,234
Excuse me,
ma'am.

135
00:08:52,772 --> 00:08:55,002
Please, may I
share this with you?

136
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:58,969
But it's
your lunch.

137
00:08:59,045 --> 00:09:01,138
I'm not very hungry.

138
00:09:01,214 --> 00:09:02,545
Go ahead.

139
00:09:03,783 --> 00:09:05,250
Thank you.

140
00:09:06,252 --> 00:09:09,551
Please, take one
of my treasures.

141
00:09:12,092 --> 00:09:13,684
I couldn't.

142
00:09:15,962 --> 00:09:19,125
You don't want to hurt her feelings.

143
00:09:22,202 --> 00:09:23,693
Well...

144
00:09:25,272 --> 00:09:26,739
Maybe this.

145
00:09:26,807 --> 00:09:28,900
There you
go then,

146
00:09:28,976 --> 00:09:32,571
a nice present
for a nice girl.

147
00:09:32,647 --> 00:09:33,978
Thank you.

148
00:09:40,521 --> 00:09:41,647
One,

149
00:09:41,722 --> 00:09:43,587
two, three.

150
00:09:44,091 --> 00:09:47,686
I guess the fancy carriage will
have to wait until next year.

151
00:09:47,762 --> 00:09:49,161
Right, Liana?

152
00:09:50,031 --> 00:09:51,259
Liana?

153
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:55,561
Now, that
is magical.

154
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:57,230
Isn't it?

155
00:09:58,406 --> 00:10:00,340
We should give it back
to that poor old woman.

156
00:10:00,408 --> 00:10:02,069
She didn't know
what she had.

157
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:05,340
Unlike us. We have
bread and jam.

158
00:10:05,813 --> 00:10:07,678
And jam and bread.

159
00:10:08,249 --> 00:10:10,149
And a ruined garden.

160
00:10:10,418 --> 00:10:12,215
We have
work to do.

161
00:10:14,121 --> 00:10:15,383
<i>I'm blindfolded</i>

162
00:10:15,456 --> 00:10:19,620
<i>On this carriage ride</i>
<i>That they call life</i>

163
00:10:19,694 --> 00:10:22,023
<i>Keep trying to make it</i>

164
00:10:22,024 --> 00:10:23,653
<i>Through that next turn</i>

165
00:10:23,731 --> 00:10:27,293
<i>Knuckles white</i>

<i>The Muses hid their musical instruments</i>

331
00:19:07,991 --> 00:19:10,161
<i>in case anything</i>
<i>should happen to them.</i>

332
00:19:11,801 --> 00:19:14,133
<i>The Muses tried to</i>
<i>reason with Lydia,</i>

333
00:19:14,203 --> 00:19:16,103
<i>but she just</i>
<i>turned on them.</i>

334
00:19:30,686 --> 00:19:34,281
<i>I ran and ran,</i>
<i>but Slyder was chasing me.</i>

335
00:19:34,357 --> 00:19:36,757
<i>And then,</i>
<i>I saw my only chance.</i>

336
00:19:42,865 --> 00:19:44,196
<i>I hid.</i>

337
00:19:44,834 --> 00:19:47,909
<i>But I dropped my whistle</i>
<i>and Slyder broke it,</i>

338
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:49,498
<i>trapping me in the mirror.</i>

339
00:19:51,907 --> 00:19:53,398
I was so afraid.

340
00:19:53,477 --> 00:19:55,570
I never said a word,

341
00:19:56,146 --> 00:19:58,080
until I met you two.

342
00:19:58,181 --> 00:19:59,375
And now, look.

343
00:19:59,449 --> 00:20:01,644
I've ruined everything.

344
00:20:01,985 --> 00:20:04,920
But if you
have the key...

345
00:20:04,988 --> 00:20:07,218
Do you know where the
Diamond Castle's hidden?

346
00:20:07,724 --> 00:20:10,090
Yes, near the
Seven Stones,

347
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,787
far to the west.

348
00:20:11,862 --> 00:20:13,921
Can Lydia
be stopped?

349
00:20:13,997 --> 00:20:15,362
I hope so.

350
00:20:15,432 --> 00:20:17,457
I think if I play
the Muses' instruments,

351
00:20:17,534 --> 00:20:19,331
I can break her spells.

352
00:20:22,406 --> 00:20:24,465
No. No. Liana,

353
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:27,135
we've never been farther
away than the village.

354
00:20:27,244 --> 00:20:31,578
Melody, what happens if Lydia
destroys the Muses' instruments?

355
00:20:31,948 --> 00:20:34,644
She wins.
She has it all.

356
00:20:34,851 --> 00:20:38,787
Our world will be nothing
but shadows and sorrow.

357
00:20:39,656 --> 00:20:41,283
Kind of like
our home.

358
00:20:41,358 --> 00:20:43,349
Exactly like
our home.

359
00:20:43,427 --> 00:20:45,952
Lydia and Slyder
did that to us.

360
00:20:46,029 --> 00:20:48,520
They'll do that and
worse to other people.

361
00:20:48,598 --> 00:20:50,498
Can we let
that happen?

362
00:20:51,468 --> 00:20:53,766
You want me to say no, don't you?

363
00:20:57,408 --> 00:20:59,638
It's the three of us now, Melody.

364
00:20:59,911 --> 00:21:02,038
Really?
The three of us?

365
00:21:02,113 --> 00:21:03,444
I like that.

366
00:21:03,514 --> 00:21:05,982
What about that serpent?
Will he come back?

367
00:21:06,317 --> 00:21:08,444
Not if I don't sing.

368
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,945
And I love singing.

369
00:21:20,998 --> 00:21:22,556
I found her,
mistress.

370
00:21:27,505 --> 00:21:28,972
Where is she?

371
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:31,304
I'm in no mood
for games, Slyder.

372
00:21:31,376 --> 00:21:33,901
Here, here. She's
hiding in the mirror.

373
00:21:33,978 --> 00:21:36,811
I saw her singing
in the mirror.

374
00:21:37,115 --> 00:21:39,174
Oh, really?

375
00:21:40,551 --> 00:21:42,280
Melody...

376
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:48,582
Auntie Lydia would like
to have a word with you.

377
00:21:50,828 --> 00:21:52,352
Melody?

378
00:21:54,832 --> 00:21:56,823
Where did
you find this?

379
00:21:57,235 --> 00:21:59,966
She was singing with two
other girls near a cottage.

380
00:22:00,038 --> 00:22:03,235
One with light hair
and one with dark hair.

381
00:22:04,343 --> 00:22:06,743
Take me to them.

382
00:22:11,617 --> 00:22:14,051
It's beyond
beautiful.

383
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:15,887
Look, Melody.

384
00:22:16,054 --> 00:22:19,217
We made it,
the Valley of Flowers.

385
00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:25,919
Mmm.

386
00:22:25,998 --> 00:22:27,022
I smell roses.

387
00:22:32,838 --> 00:22:34,032
Liana.

388
00:22:43,015 --> 00:22:44,004
Snake!

389
00:22:52,825 --> 00:22:53,814
Cutest snake
I've ever seen.

390
00:22:54,993 --> 00:22:58,087
Okay, okay, I was only
trying to protect you.

391
00:23:03,369 --> 00:23:04,961
Look at you.

392
00:23:05,038 --> 00:23:07,666
Aren't you the
cutest thing?

393
00:23:07,974 --> 00:23:09,532
Where'd they
come from?

394
00:23:09,609 --> 00:23:11,600
There's nobody
for miles.

395
00:23:12,178 --> 00:23:13,975
They must
be lost.

396
00:23:14,214 --> 00:23:16,205
Look,
they're friends.

397
00:23:19,419 --> 00:23:21,216
We can't leave
them here.

398
00:23:21,287 --> 00:23:22,618
They'll starve.

399
00:23:22,822 --> 00:23:25,620
Hey, hey,
that tickles.

400
00:23:27,594 --> 00:23:30,119
What do you think, Melody?
She's a keeper right?

401
00:23:30,396 --> 00:23:33,729
Aw, look at
her sparkly little eyes.

402
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,400
Sparkles, I like that.

403
00:23:36,703 --> 00:23:38,967
I hereby name you
Sparkles.

404
00:23:42,976 --> 00:23:45,171
And what should
we call that little one?

405
00:23:45,245 --> 00:23:48,544
Your name is Lily,
like the beautiful flower.

406
00:23:48,848 --> 00:23:50,816
Can we keep them?
Can we keep them?

407
00:23:50,884 --> 00:23:53,409
I think we have
room for two more.

408
00:23:53,486 --> 00:23:56,580
Oh, I bet you little guys
are hungry though, aren't you?

409
00:23:56,656 --> 00:23:58,317
Don't even talk
about food,

410
00:23:58,391 --> 00:24:01,326
my stomach has been
rumbling for miles.

411
00:24:01,528 --> 00:24:03,656
Ah! So, that's
what I was hearing.

412
00:24:03,731 --> 00:24:05,460
I thought
it was thunder.

413
00:24:05,666 --> 00:24:07,793
Or stampeding horses.

414
00:24:07,868 --> 00:24:09,335
Enough.

415
00:24:09,537 --> 00:24:11,562
Or jump
roping elephants.

416
00:24:25,853 --> 00:24:26,842
Mmm!

417
00:24:26,921 --> 00:24:29,082
Smells like
roast chicken.

418
00:24:29,156 --> 00:24:31,056
I'm starving.

419
00:24:31,125 --> 00:24:34,219
Go ahead, you
haven't eaten all day.

420
00:24:34,795 --> 00:24:38,060
We'd love to, but we
don't have any money.

421
00:24:38,999 --> 00:24:41,467
That's where the
smell is coming from.

422
00:24:48,909 --> 00:24:51,810
Am I drooling?
I think I'm drooling.

423
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:55,911
Have you seen him?
Well, have you?

424
00:24:55,983 --> 00:24:57,143
Who?

425
00:24:57,217 --> 00:24:59,777
Those good for
nothing musicians.

426
00:24:59,853 --> 00:25:01,514
They were due
here an hour ago.

427
00:25:01,589 --> 00:25:03,216
I should never
have hired them.

428
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:07,022
I told myself, "Edgar, don't
hire those rascals again."

429
00:25:07,095 --> 00:25:10,462
Oh, but did I
listen to myself, no!

430
00:25:10,532 --> 00:25:12,090
When are
they coming?

431
00:25:12,167 --> 00:25:13,964
They're getting
restless.

432
00:25:16,237 --> 00:25:18,637
Hold your horses,
they're coming.

433
00:25:18,707 --> 00:25:22,040
Actually, they're here.
That is, we're here.

434
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:24,010
We're the
substitute rascals.

435
00:25:24,079 --> 00:25:26,240
Uh... Musicians.

436
00:25:26,781 --> 00:25:28,180
We are?

437
00:25:28,249 --> 00:25:29,273
We are.

438
00:25:29,351 --> 00:25:31,649
We're very good and
we'll only cost you...

439
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:34,052
A meal.
I mean, two meals.

440
00:25:36,424 --> 00:25:38,585
And two
doggie bags.

441
00:25:39,628 --> 00:25:40,822
Hmm...

442
00:25:40,895 --> 00:25:42,829
How do I know
you can play?

443
00:25:42,897 --> 00:25:44,194
Where
is the music?

444
00:25:45,967 --> 00:25:46,956
You're hired.

445
00:25:53,875 --> 00:25:54,899
Hey!

446
00:25:54,976 --> 00:25:57,570
Perfectly good
mashed potatoes.

447
00:25:57,646 --> 00:26:00,240
Think I could get them to
throw some gravy this way?

448
00:26:00,315 --> 00:26:01,543
Come on.

449
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:03,675
Give us some music,
will you?

450
00:26:11,961 --> 00:26:13,121
Who are they?

451
00:26:14,964 --> 00:26:16,124
Good evening.

452
00:26:16,198 --> 00:26:17,392
Hello.

453
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:30,374
<i>Here we are</i>

454
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,905
<i>Far from home</i>

455
00:26:33,849 --> 00:26:36,374
<i>Little bit hungry</i>

456
00:26:36,452 --> 00:26:38,647
<i>And a little alone</i>

457
00:26:38,888 --> 00:26:42,722
<i>But it's all right</i>

458
00:26:43,325 --> 00:26:47,261
<i>Yes, it's all right</i>

459
00:26:48,631 --> 00:26:50,622
<i>'Cause in this room</i>

460
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:52,895
<i>There might be friends</i>

461
00:26:52,968 --> 00:26:56,631
<i>Can't see how the story ends</i>

462
00:26:57,273 --> 00:27:00,709
<i>But it's all right</i>

463
00:27:01,143 --> 00:27:05,409
<i>Yeah, it's all right</i>

464
00:27:05,915 --> 00:27:08,713
<i>We can start</i>

465
00:27:08,784 --> 00:27:12,846
<i>Anew</i>

466
00:27:13,223 --> 00:27:17,057
<i>Can't go back</i>
<i>So we gotta go on</i>

467
00:27:17,127 --> 00:27:19,960
<i>We'll stick together</i>
<i>Staying strong</i>

468
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:24,091
<i>There's a diamond castle</i>
<i>In my mind</i>

469
00:27:24,167 --> 00:27:27,762
<i>And someday soon</i>
<i>We're gonna find it</i>

470
00:27:27,838 --> 00:27:29,567
<i>We're gonna find it</i>

471
00:27:29,639 --> 00:27:31,470
<i>We're gonna find it</i>

472
00:27:31,541 --> 00:27:34,567
<i>We're gonna find it</i>

473
00:27:35,846 --> 00:27:38,940
<i>Somehow things are looking up</i>

474
00:27:39,316 --> 00:27:42,308
<i>Feeling like we've</i>
<i>Changed our luck</i>

475
00:27:42,385 --> 00:27:45,752
<i>I can see life</i>

476
00:27:45,822 --> 00:27:49,519
<i>In a new light</i>

477
00:27:49,726 --> 00:27:51,455
<i>Can't stay long</i>
<i>Can't stay long</i>

478
00:27:51,528 --> 00:27:53,223
<i>Passing through</i>
<i>Passing through</i>

479
00:27:53,296 --> 00:27:54,854
<i>Don't know where we're</i>

480
00:27:54,931 --> 00:27:56,228
<i>Going to</i>

481
00:27:56,299 --> 00:27:59,632
<i>But it's all right</i>

482
00:27:59,703 --> 00:28:03,662
<i>'Cause we just might</i>

483
00:28:03,907 --> 00:28:06,398
<i>Find a way</i>

484
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:10,469
<i>That's true</i>

485
00:28:10,547 --> 00:28:12,913
<i>Can't go back</i>
<i>So we got to go on</i>

486
00:28:12,983 --> 00:28:15,714
Cheeky they are,
taking our place.

487
00:28:16,821 --> 00:28:18,721
Not bad though.

488
00:28:18,823 --> 00:28:21,087
Not bad, for girls.

489
00:28:21,159 --> 00:28:24,754
<i>And someday soon</i>
<i>We're gonna find it</i>

490
00:28:24,829 --> 00:28:26,194
<i>We're gonna find it</i>

491
00:28:26,264 --> 00:28:27,526
<i>We're gonna find</i>

492
00:28:27,598 --> 00:28:31,364
<i>The perfect place</i>
<i>For us to be</i>

493
00:28:31,435 --> 00:28:34,404
<i>And hear our</i>
<i>Melody set free</i>

494
00:28:37,909 --> 00:28:40,571
Wait, wait...

495
00:28:40,645 --> 00:28:43,045
I feel something.

496
00:28:43,114 --> 00:28:45,605
It's very faint.

497
00:28:45,683 --> 00:28:49,050
Can't quite make it out,
but it's just about...

498
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,315
Oh, I think I got it.

499
00:28:51,389 --> 00:28:54,324
Oh, just take me
to her. Now!

500
00:28:55,693 --> 00:28:57,024
Yes, mistress.

501
00:28:57,094 --> 00:28:58,823
<i>We're gonna find it</i>

502
00:28:58,896 --> 00:29:00,056
<i>Can't go back</i>

503
00:29:00,131 --> 00:29:02,497
<i>So we got to go on</i>

504
00:29:02,567 --> 00:29:05,331
<i>We'll stick together</i>
<i>Staying strong</i>

505
00:29:05,403 --> 00:29:09,169
<i>There's a diamond castle</i>
<i>In my mind</i>

506
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:11,140
<i>And someday soon</i>

507
00:29:11,209 --> 00:29:12,904
<i>We're gonna find it</i>

508
00:29:12,977 --> 00:29:14,604
<i>We're gonna find it</i>

509
00:29:14,679 --> 00:29:16,237
<i>We're gonna find it</i>

510
00:29:16,314 --> 00:29:17,941
<i>We're gonna find it</i>

511
00:29:18,015 --> 00:29:19,881
<i>We're gonna find it</i>

512
00:29:19,952 --> 00:29:22,113
<i>We're gonna find it</i>

513
00:29:22,187 --> 00:29:25,645
<i>We're gonna find it</i>

514
00:29:25,724 --> 00:29:29,922
<i>Someday soon</i>

515
00:29:32,164 --> 00:29:33,631
Thank you.

516
00:29:36,468 --> 00:29:38,595
And for our
next number...

517
00:29:39,504 --> 00:29:41,267
Mashed potatoes.

518
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,865
We're going to
take a little break.

519
00:29:46,511 --> 00:29:48,206
You've earned your keep.

520
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:49,645
Thank you.

521
00:29:55,988 --> 00:29:58,821
<i>Two maidens were stealing</i>

522
00:29:59,258 --> 00:30:01,818
<i>A gig from two kind men</i>

523
00:30:03,528 --> 00:30:05,962
<i>Whose singing was magic</i>

524
00:30:07,132 --> 00:30:09,726
<i>They were both so handsome</i>

525
00:30:09,801 --> 00:30:12,201
How did you get to
be so good-looking?

526
00:30:12,271 --> 00:30:13,295
Genetics.

527
00:30:13,372 --> 00:30:14,634
Ah!

528
00:30:14,706 --> 00:30:17,732
<i>One girl fair and pretty</i>

529
00:30:18,844 --> 00:30:21,005
<i>And one a dark beauty</i>

530
00:30:22,215 --> 00:30:25,082
<i>One wearing orange</i>

531
00:30:25,151 --> 00:30:26,982
<i>And one...</i>

532
00:30:27,053 --> 00:30:29,487
Well, you know perfectly well
nothing rhymes with orange.

533
00:30:29,889 --> 00:30:33,120
<i>In this song you belong</i>

534
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,990
<i>With lads like us</i>

535
00:30:37,664 --> 00:30:39,154
<i>In this song you belong</i>

536
00:30:39,232 --> 00:30:40,221
<i>You belong</i>

537
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:43,167
<i>You belong</i>

538
00:30:43,236 --> 00:30:45,227
<i>With lads like us</i>

539
00:30:45,305 --> 00:30:46,329
Hey!

540
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,699
That's for leaving
without a goodbye.

541
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:53,240
Sorry,
that was meant for me.

542
00:30:54,213 --> 00:30:55,475
I feel for you.

543
00:30:55,548 --> 00:30:58,642
Far be it from us to
spoil a happy reunion.

544
00:30:58,785 --> 00:31:00,275
Come on, Alexa.

545
00:31:00,453 --> 00:31:02,387
No, no, my apologies.

546
00:31:02,455 --> 00:31:04,184
That was ancient history.

547
00:31:04,424 --> 00:31:05,652
Uh... Ian.

548
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,349
Hey!

549
00:31:09,028 --> 00:31:11,155
Smells like mashed
potatoes, too.

550
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:15,899
They skipped out.

551
00:31:16,336 --> 00:31:17,462
Incredible.

552
00:31:17,537 --> 00:31:19,698
We always
get the girl.

553
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:21,564
Ah!

554
00:31:21,641 --> 00:31:24,611
Wait, the story
is not over.

555
00:31:24,678 --> 00:31:27,476
I'm guessing they
left it on purpose.

556
00:31:27,548 --> 00:31:29,106
So, we could
return it.

557
00:31:29,183 --> 00:31:30,912
Would a
girl do that?

558
00:31:30,985 --> 00:31:32,919
It is possible.

559
00:31:32,987 --> 00:31:35,683
The only polite thing
to do is find them.

560
00:31:35,956 --> 00:31:37,423
Definitely.

561
00:31:43,097 --> 00:31:45,622
Nice to see
you too, Bertha.

562
00:32:03,417 --> 00:32:04,850
I'm looking
for two girls.

563
00:32:04,918 --> 00:32:06,613
One light haired,
one dark haired.

564
00:32:06,687 --> 00:32:07,745
Did they
pass this way?

565
00:32:07,821 --> 00:32:09,049
I...

566
00:32:09,623 --> 00:32:11,352
I don't remember.

567
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:15,253
Really? Memory
escapes you, does it?

568
00:32:37,318 --> 00:32:39,843
Oh, look at all
these sad, sad faces.

569
00:32:39,921 --> 00:32:42,583
So, deliciously
dreadful.

570
00:32:43,391 --> 00:32:46,383
Let's try again,
shall we?

571
00:32:46,461 --> 00:32:48,588
Where are the girls?

572
00:32:50,131 --> 00:32:53,623
Out back,
down the trail.

573
00:32:56,771 --> 00:32:58,500
You have
to be kidding.

574
00:32:58,573 --> 00:33:01,633
No, they were
really cute.

575
00:33:01,743 --> 00:33:03,938
Too cute for
their own good.

576
00:33:05,246 --> 00:33:06,907
What is it, Sparkles?

577
00:33:09,184 --> 00:33:10,651
We better get
out of here.

578
00:33:10,718 --> 00:33:12,549
Why? What's
wrong?

579
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:14,247
Slyder!

580
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:16,214
Lydia.

581
00:33:16,291 --> 00:33:17,883
So, you know
my name.

582
00:33:17,959 --> 00:33:20,154
I wonder who could have told you.

583
00:33:20,228 --> 00:33:21,786
Leave them alone.

584
00:33:22,063 --> 00:33:26,090
Ha! Doesn't take much
to fool Slyder, I see.

585
00:33:27,769 --> 00:33:29,532
Give me the mirror.

586
00:33:31,073 --> 00:33:33,007
The mirror, now!

587
00:33:33,075 --> 00:33:34,736
I don't think so.

588
00:33:35,711 --> 00:33:39,010
Oh, you won't.
What will I do?

589
00:33:42,885 --> 00:33:44,375
No!

590
00:34:02,738 --> 00:34:03,727
The mirror.

591
00:34:04,573 --> 00:34:05,597
Never!

592
00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:09,043
How on Earth...

593
00:34:09,111 --> 00:34:11,170
Run, Alexa, run!

594
00:34:11,247 --> 00:34:13,147
Slyder, get them!

595
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:28,353
Don't look back!

596
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:37,900
Up we go.

597
00:34:37,974 --> 00:34:39,236
Not late, am I?

598
00:34:39,309 --> 00:34:42,301
Not yet.
Go, go, go!

599
00:35:04,034 --> 00:35:05,592
Watch out!

600
00:35:05,702 --> 00:35:07,636
Ye of little faith.

601
00:35:28,425 --> 00:35:30,359
Wherever did
you come from?

602
00:35:30,427 --> 00:35:32,793
Is that how you
say thank you?

603
00:35:32,996 --> 00:35:35,362
I'm sorry,
thank you.

604
00:35:35,432 --> 00:35:36,422
We were almost...

605
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:37,592
But you weren't.

606
00:35:37,668 --> 00:35:39,829
Timing is everything.

607
00:35:40,271 --> 00:35:42,000
Your handkerchief.

608
00:35:42,073 --> 00:35:43,768
Thank you.

609
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:48,073
Jeremy.
Liana.

610
00:35:48,145 --> 00:35:49,476
My brother Ian.

611
00:35:49,547 --> 00:35:51,071
My friend Alexa.

612
00:35:51,515 --> 00:35:53,312
An honor, milady.

613
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:55,042
You're twins.

614
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:57,053
What? No!

615
00:35:57,121 --> 00:35:58,315
Really?

616
00:35:58,389 --> 00:36:00,016
Mum should
have told us.

617
00:36:00,091 --> 00:36:01,422
I feel cheated.

618
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:02,481
Duped.

619
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,686
Hoodwinked.

620
00:36:03,761 --> 00:36:04,955
They think
they're charming.

621
00:36:05,029 --> 00:36:06,394
Rakish.
Roguish.

622
00:36:07,164 --> 00:36:09,325
Is he gone?
Is anybody hurt?

623
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,424
Hmm?

624
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:11,934
I don't understand,

625
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:14,528
how'd you escape
Lydia's flute?

626
00:36:15,273 --> 00:36:16,740
I don't know.

627
00:36:16,807 --> 00:36:19,742
I avoided the spell by
disappearing, but you...

628
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:21,277
I just don't get it.

629
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:25,913
Mind us asking what we've
gotten ourselves into?

630
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:31,978
There were two...
No, no, 20 men. Uh... Soldiers.

631
00:36:32,056 --> 00:36:33,717
Lashing swords
everywhere.

632
00:36:33,791 --> 00:36:35,918
I finished off
scores of them.

633
00:36:35,993 --> 00:36:37,756
But in the end,

634
00:36:37,828 --> 00:36:39,194
the girls escaped.

635
00:36:39,264 --> 00:36:40,891
Quiet, I'm thinking.

636
00:36:40,966 --> 00:36:44,231
Oh, that's good.
You go right ahead. Think away.

637
00:36:45,337 --> 00:36:46,361
Hmm...

638
00:36:46,438 --> 00:36:48,702
Has to be, yes.

639
00:36:48,774 --> 00:36:52,904
They wear stones from
the Diamond Castle.

640
00:36:56,248 --> 00:36:58,910
And here we are,
the Grand River.

641
00:37:00,585 --> 00:37:02,576
Do you know
this place, Melody?

642
00:37:03,488 --> 00:37:05,615
This is good.
Really good.

643
00:37:05,691 --> 00:37:08,956
We just have to make it
across to the Seven Stones.

644
00:37:10,162 --> 00:37:11,390
I wonder...

645
00:37:11,463 --> 00:37:15,194
Ian, do you remember those odd
rocks we passed last spring?

646
00:37:15,834 --> 00:37:17,563
Yes, I do.

647
00:37:17,636 --> 00:37:20,400
Something almost
magical about them.

648
00:37:20,806 --> 00:37:24,105
Melody, what do the
Seven Stones look like?

649
00:37:24,843 --> 00:37:25,969
Here.

650
00:37:27,212 --> 00:37:29,510
Well, there you go,
same place.

651
00:37:29,614 --> 00:37:32,014
I know exactly
where it is.

652
00:37:34,286 --> 00:37:36,311
Wait! The sign
shows a bridge.

653
00:37:36,388 --> 00:37:39,482
Probably washed
out long ago.

654
00:37:39,558 --> 00:37:41,618
But it would be
so much faster.

655
00:37:41,694 --> 00:37:44,595
No, not really.
We're doing fine.

656
00:37:44,664 --> 00:37:46,564
Shall we
carry on, Ian?

657
00:37:46,632 --> 00:37:49,601
Oh, straight ahead, old boy.
Straight ahead.

658
00:37:53,473 --> 00:37:54,531
Sparkles.

659
00:37:54,607 --> 00:37:55,699
Lily.

660
00:37:59,645 --> 00:38:00,634
Be right back.

661
00:38:02,081 --> 00:38:03,810
We could just
keep going.

662
00:38:03,883 --> 00:38:05,180
We could.

663
00:38:05,251 --> 00:38:06,809
But we won't.

664
00:38:06,886 --> 00:38:07,875
No.

665
00:38:11,457 --> 00:38:13,721
Here, Sparkles!
Here, girl.

666
00:38:15,094 --> 00:38:16,891
Something's wrong.

667
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:21,189
Looking for
these morsels?

668
00:38:21,768 --> 00:38:23,099
Put them down.

669
00:38:24,337 --> 00:38:27,465
Now why would
I choose to do that?

670
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:28,802
Common courtesy.

671
00:38:31,244 --> 00:38:34,509
I know you and you.

672
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:36,343
Double trouble.

673
00:38:36,416 --> 00:38:38,782
You owe me!

674
00:38:38,851 --> 00:38:40,842
Ancient history,
mate.

675
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:45,556
Meat, you two.

676
00:38:45,626 --> 00:38:47,491
He's got a point.

677
00:38:47,561 --> 00:38:50,257
And a rather
sharp one, at that.

678
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:01,235
Thank you for
releasing the dogs,

679
00:39:01,308 --> 00:39:03,173
you'll free the
gentlemen, next.

680
00:39:04,311 --> 00:39:06,176
Free them?

681
00:39:06,246 --> 00:39:08,476
I'm gonna eat some.

682
00:39:08,882 --> 00:39:11,749
Those boys?
They'll give you indigestion.

683
00:39:12,085 --> 00:39:13,382
Don't care.

684
00:39:13,454 --> 00:39:15,581
Collecting on
an old debt.

685
00:39:15,889 --> 00:39:17,322
They owe
you money?

686
00:39:17,391 --> 00:39:19,018
No, lives.

687
00:39:19,493 --> 00:39:22,894
They wanted to cross my bridge.

688
00:39:22,963 --> 00:39:24,863
But there isn't any bridge.

689
00:39:25,098 --> 00:39:28,659
Course there is,
if you answer my riddle.

690
00:39:28,969 --> 00:39:31,870
And they failed,
just like everyone else.

691
00:39:32,506 --> 00:39:34,133
Ask us your riddle.

692
00:39:34,208 --> 00:39:36,802
If we answer correctly,
you let them go.

693
00:39:36,877 --> 00:39:40,313
If we don't, you have dinner
for tomorrow night, too.

694
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:41,779
It's a deal.

695
00:39:42,115 --> 00:39:44,083
Are you ready?

696
00:39:44,151 --> 00:39:45,550
Of course.

697
00:39:47,856 --> 00:39:51,257
What instrument
can you hear,

698
00:39:51,326 --> 00:39:53,055
but can't see

699
00:39:53,127 --> 00:39:55,220
and can't touch?

700
00:39:56,731 --> 00:39:59,666
It's a trick. There's no
instrument like that.

701
00:40:00,335 --> 00:40:02,565
Final answer?

702
00:40:02,637 --> 00:40:03,831
No.

703
00:40:04,472 --> 00:40:06,440
Melody, what
do you think?

704
00:40:06,508 --> 00:40:07,634
I don't know.

705
00:40:07,709 --> 00:40:09,677
You play every
instrument I know

706
00:40:09,744 --> 00:40:12,042
with either your hands
or your mouth.

707
00:40:12,714 --> 00:40:16,081
Right. Your hands
or your mouth...

708
00:40:21,155 --> 00:40:23,623
Your time is...

709
00:40:23,691 --> 00:40:25,852
The answer is,
your voice.

710
00:40:25,927 --> 00:40:28,657
You can't see it or touch it,
but when you sing,

711
00:40:28,730 --> 00:40:30,493
everybody
can hear it.

712
00:40:30,565 --> 00:40:31,964
Yes.

713
00:40:33,001 --> 00:40:35,629
No! No, no, no.

714
00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:37,360
Can't be done.

715
00:40:37,438 --> 00:40:39,998
Can't be done.
No! No! No!

716
00:40:43,845 --> 00:40:45,210
Is it real?

717
00:40:45,747 --> 00:40:47,806
Yes.

718
00:40:47,882 --> 00:40:50,146
Nobody knows my riddle.
Impossible.

719
00:40:50,218 --> 00:40:52,084
Unthink...

720
00:40:53,889 --> 00:40:56,824
Pity, I was rather
looking forward to dinner.

721
00:41:00,162 --> 00:41:01,151
Hey!

722
00:41:02,865 --> 00:41:03,991
Girls...

723
00:41:04,066 --> 00:41:05,158
Wait for us.

724
00:41:06,035 --> 00:41:07,434
We can't.

725
00:41:07,903 --> 00:41:10,463
Meet us at the
Seven Stones.

726
00:41:11,674 --> 00:41:13,801
What's wrong with
that picture?

727
00:41:13,876 --> 00:41:15,571
Everything.

728
00:41:22,551 --> 00:41:24,985
I can't do it
anymore, Liana.

729
00:41:25,054 --> 00:41:27,181
We've been walking for hours.

730
00:41:29,124 --> 00:41:30,614
Are you okay?

731
00:41:31,126 --> 00:41:32,923
Do we have
a little water?

732
00:41:32,995 --> 00:41:34,360
We ran out.

733
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:37,422
About an hour after
we ran out of food.

734
00:41:37,499 --> 00:41:38,796
Oh.

735
00:41:38,867 --> 00:41:40,027
I know.

736
00:41:49,111 --> 00:41:51,671
Alexa, I see
something.

737
00:41:52,915 --> 00:41:54,406
And it's
not that far.

738
00:42:01,891 --> 00:42:04,724
This mansion,
it's beautiful.

739
00:42:05,095 --> 00:42:07,120
I wonder if someone
royal lives here.

740
00:42:07,597 --> 00:42:10,464
Hopefully someone
generous and royal.

741
00:42:10,533 --> 00:42:12,524
Who can spare a bed and some food.

742
00:42:21,645 --> 00:42:23,408
You've come
at last.

743
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:27,147
Welcome.
Welcome, miladies.

744
00:42:30,987 --> 00:42:32,545
Sparkles, no!

745
00:42:37,994 --> 00:42:39,859
What may
we serve you?

746
00:42:40,430 --> 00:42:42,398
Could you spare
some bread and water?

747
00:42:42,866 --> 00:42:45,232
Please, this
is all yours.

748
00:42:45,635 --> 00:42:48,798
The grounds,
the house, everything.

749
00:42:49,272 --> 00:42:50,398
Ours?

750
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:51,698
The legend.

751
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:54,209
It's been foretold
two friends,

752
00:42:54,277 --> 00:42:57,770
best friends, will come
to live in the hall.

753
00:42:57,848 --> 00:43:00,408
For years, we've been
tending the hall

754
00:43:00,484 --> 00:43:02,611
until the rightful
owners arrive.

755
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:04,954
You must
be mistaken.

756
00:43:05,022 --> 00:43:08,253
No. It's just as
the legend foretold.

757
00:43:09,727 --> 00:43:11,388
I can't
believe it.

758
00:43:11,462 --> 00:43:13,191
I don't
believe it.

759
00:43:14,699 --> 00:43:16,360
What do you
think, Melody?

760
00:43:16,434 --> 00:43:20,427
You know, the Muses sing songs
about legends and destiny.

761
00:43:20,504 --> 00:43:22,597
This really
could be yours.

762
00:43:22,673 --> 00:43:24,436
So, if
it's ours...

763
00:43:24,508 --> 00:43:26,271
Do you think we can eat something?

764
00:43:26,777 --> 00:43:28,608
Yes. Go, eat.

765
00:43:35,653 --> 00:43:38,019
Oh, of course you get your share.

766
00:43:42,927 --> 00:43:45,919
You don't have to
do tricks for your supper.

767
00:43:45,996 --> 00:43:47,964
What's mine is yours.

768
00:43:53,537 --> 00:43:54,697
Oh!

769
00:43:54,772 --> 00:43:56,535
They're
beautiful.

770
00:43:57,341 --> 00:43:58,808
Try one on.

771
00:44:03,648 --> 00:44:05,513
I look like
a princess.

772
00:44:06,251 --> 00:44:08,879
Oh, Liana,
it's a perfect home for us.

773
00:44:08,954 --> 00:44:10,819
More food than we could ever eat,

774
00:44:10,889 --> 00:44:13,357
a beautiful
dress every day

775
00:44:13,425 --> 00:44:15,552
and a gorgeous
garden.

776
00:44:15,627 --> 00:44:17,652
But we can't stay.

777
00:44:17,729 --> 00:44:19,663
Why not?
It's ours.

778
00:44:19,731 --> 00:44:21,426
We're finally having
some good luck,

779
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:23,195
why can't
we enjoy it?

780
00:44:23,268 --> 00:44:26,999
Maybe we can come back after we
take Melody to the Diamond Castle.

781
00:44:27,072 --> 00:44:28,539
If we come back.

782
00:44:28,874 --> 00:44:30,034
What do you mean?

783
00:44:30,108 --> 00:44:32,633
Trolls, serpents,
evil magic.

784
00:44:33,178 --> 00:44:34,702
We may not live
to come back.

785
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:36,873
We promised Melody
we'd help her.

786
00:44:36,948 --> 00:44:39,940
And we did.
We've taken her this far.

787
00:44:40,018 --> 00:44:42,646
I can't go
any farther.

788
00:44:42,721 --> 00:44:43,745
I can't.

789
00:44:43,822 --> 00:44:45,050
But, we promised.

790
00:44:45,123 --> 00:44:46,283
You gave your word.

791
00:44:46,358 --> 00:44:48,223
Let Ian and
Jeremy do it.

792
00:44:48,293 --> 00:44:50,056
I'm staying here.

793
00:44:50,295 --> 00:44:51,762
You don't mean that.

794
00:44:51,830 --> 00:44:53,354
Yes, I do.

795
00:44:53,431 --> 00:44:56,457
Please, don't argue.
You've done enough.

796
00:44:56,968 --> 00:44:59,436
See, even
Melody thinks so.

797
00:44:59,504 --> 00:45:00,971
Stay with me.

798
00:45:01,039 --> 00:45:05,534
If we don't stop Lydia,
we'll all be living under a dark cloud.

799
00:45:05,645 --> 00:45:09,081
No laughter, no music,
just sadness everywhere.

800
00:45:09,148 --> 00:45:11,309
Why us?
Why can't somebody else do it?

801
00:45:11,384 --> 00:45:13,147
Because Melody
is our friend.

802
00:45:13,219 --> 00:45:15,653
You're choosing
Melody over me.

803
00:45:15,755 --> 00:45:18,781
No, it's
not like that.

804
00:45:18,858 --> 00:45:21,622
If you were really my friend,
you'd understand.

805
00:45:22,528 --> 00:45:23,859
You're right,

806
00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:25,761
I don't understand.

807
00:45:25,832 --> 00:45:27,595
Come on,
Sparkles.

808
00:45:28,701 --> 00:45:29,895
Ready, Melody?

809
00:45:29,969 --> 00:45:32,028
We are going to
the Seven Stones.

810
00:45:58,197 --> 00:45:59,687
No, Lily.

811
00:45:59,832 --> 00:46:01,629
I can't believe
she did that.

812
00:46:09,109 --> 00:46:10,201
Liana?

813
00:46:31,198 --> 00:46:33,166
Liked the manor,
did you?

814
00:46:33,233 --> 00:46:35,861
So terribly
tempting.

815
00:46:35,936 --> 00:46:37,198
How did you know?

816
00:46:37,304 --> 00:46:39,101
Because I was
there first.

817
00:46:39,172 --> 00:46:41,936
Did the servants tell
you about a legend?

818
00:46:42,009 --> 00:46:43,909
Yes, they said
that two...

819
00:46:44,845 --> 00:46:47,006
They were under
your power.

820
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:48,513
Mmm-hmm.

821
00:46:48,582 --> 00:46:51,050
Now, give me
the mirror.

822
00:46:51,618 --> 00:46:53,552
I don't
have it.

823
00:47:07,734 --> 00:47:09,100
You hurt her.

824
00:47:11,472 --> 00:47:13,235
No mirror,
mistress.

825
00:47:13,308 --> 00:47:15,640
So, the other
girl has it.

826
00:47:15,710 --> 00:47:16,904
Where is
your friend,

827
00:47:16,978 --> 00:47:19,572
or should I say
ex-friend?

828
00:47:19,647 --> 00:47:22,241
I don't know.

829
00:47:24,686 --> 00:47:26,677
That doesn't
work on me.

830
00:47:26,754 --> 00:47:29,814
Bold words for a girl who
no longer wears her necklace.

831
00:47:29,891 --> 00:47:33,850
As long as you and your friend wore
your guardian stones, you were protected.

832
00:47:33,928 --> 00:47:35,725
But now...

833
00:47:46,107 --> 00:47:47,540
Where is she?

834
00:47:47,608 --> 00:47:51,100
Going to the
Seven Stones.

835
00:47:51,179 --> 00:47:53,374
Slyder, get the
girl and the mirror.

836
00:47:53,448 --> 00:47:55,473
And this time,
do it right.

837
00:47:56,217 --> 00:47:57,741
Yes, mistress.

838
00:48:11,166 --> 00:48:12,963
This must be it,
right?

839
00:48:13,702 --> 00:48:15,829
The Seven Stones!
We're here!

840
00:48:15,904 --> 00:48:18,168
We're really here.
You did it.

841
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:22,267
Just down there is the misty
glade and the Diamond Castle.

842
00:48:26,215 --> 00:48:27,910
I wish Alexa
were with us.

843
00:48:27,983 --> 00:48:30,884
Yes, well, she
made her choice.

844
00:48:31,286 --> 00:48:33,720
Liana, I know
you miss her.

845
00:48:34,256 --> 00:48:36,850
Miss her?
Why would I miss her?

846
00:48:36,925 --> 00:48:39,655
We've only been friends for
as long as I can remember.

847
00:48:39,728 --> 00:48:42,026
She's been with me through the
best and worst times of my life.

848
00:48:43,165 --> 00:48:46,760
She knows me better than anyone
else in the entire universe.

849
00:48:47,603 --> 00:48:49,935
I feel like a part
of me is gone.

850
00:48:52,174 --> 00:48:53,664
What is it?

851
00:48:56,812 --> 00:48:58,871
Put me down.

852
00:48:58,947 --> 00:49:01,814
Mistress Lydia
will be glad to see you.

853
00:49:09,825 --> 00:49:12,316
Welcome, darling.

854
00:49:12,861 --> 00:49:14,887
I have nothing
to say to you.

855
00:49:15,031 --> 00:49:16,020
Aw!

856
00:49:16,099 --> 00:49:18,465
That must be because
you're lonely.

857
00:49:18,535 --> 00:49:21,698
Alexa, won't
you join us?

858
00:49:24,307 --> 00:49:26,798
Alexa!
Alexa!

859
00:49:29,913 --> 00:49:31,938
She told me where to find you.

860
00:49:32,015 --> 00:49:35,473
Friends are highly
overrated, don't you think?

861
00:49:37,854 --> 00:49:39,754
And here it is.

862
00:49:39,856 --> 00:49:43,849
Ah! So much trouble
for such a little apprentice.

863
00:49:45,128 --> 00:49:47,995
Melody, I know
you can hear me.

864
00:49:48,465 --> 00:49:51,696
Melody,
come out now.

865
00:49:52,035 --> 00:49:53,900
Oh,
stubborn girl.

866
00:49:53,970 --> 00:49:56,564
Walk, Alexa, walk.

867
00:50:02,479 --> 00:50:05,812
Alexa, no!
Stop, stop!

868
00:50:07,117 --> 00:50:09,142
She only
listens to me.

869
00:50:09,552 --> 00:50:13,352
And I'll only stop her
if Melody asks me to.

870
00:50:14,557 --> 00:50:17,493
Anything to say,
Melly Belly?

871
00:50:37,214 --> 00:50:38,545
Stop her, Lydia.

872
00:50:39,016 --> 00:50:40,415
Girl, wait.

873
00:50:45,523 --> 00:50:47,957
I want the key to
the Diamond Castle.

874
00:50:48,025 --> 00:50:50,255
Let my friends go.

875
00:50:50,327 --> 00:50:51,919
Ha! The key first,

876
00:50:51,996 --> 00:50:53,554
and show me
where the castle is,

877
00:50:53,631 --> 00:50:55,121
then I'll release them.

878
00:51:00,037 --> 00:51:01,265
Okay.

879
00:51:01,338 --> 00:51:03,636
But we come right
back to let them go.

880
00:51:03,707 --> 00:51:06,471
Oh, there's
a good girl.

881
00:51:06,977 --> 00:51:09,172
Meet me
outside, Slyder.

882
00:51:10,314 --> 00:51:12,009
When you're ready.

883
00:51:22,327 --> 00:51:24,693
Alexa, Alexa,
wake up.

884
00:51:24,763 --> 00:51:26,697
It's me, Liana.

885
00:51:27,399 --> 00:51:29,765
On behalf of my
great mistress,

886
00:51:29,834 --> 00:51:32,632
the one and
only Muse.

887
00:51:45,550 --> 00:51:46,574
Aw.

888
00:51:46,651 --> 00:51:49,449
Nothing like
a sad ending.

889
00:52:00,298 --> 00:52:01,993
West, I presume?

890
00:52:03,201 --> 00:52:04,190
Yes.

891
00:52:16,881 --> 00:52:18,746
No sign of them.

892
00:52:18,817 --> 00:52:20,546
Must have gone
without us.

893
00:52:20,619 --> 00:52:21,847
Disappointing.

894
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:23,786
To say the least.

895
00:52:25,157 --> 00:52:26,488
Oh, hang on.

896
00:52:28,761 --> 00:52:31,559
Okay, okay,
what's the rush?

897
00:52:31,631 --> 00:52:33,223
Where's Liana?

898
00:52:35,234 --> 00:52:37,634
Why do I have
a bad feeling?

899
00:52:38,104 --> 00:52:39,571
Where are they, girl?

900
00:52:53,753 --> 00:52:55,220
I'm sorry,
Alexa.

901
00:52:55,288 --> 00:52:56,915
Why did I
ever leave?

902
00:52:56,989 --> 00:52:58,718
I'm so sorry.

903
00:53:02,228 --> 00:53:03,388
Lily?

904
00:53:05,164 --> 00:53:07,132
That's Alexa's
necklace.

905
00:53:08,067 --> 00:53:11,969
We were both wearing the necklaces
when Lydia couldn't mesmerize us.

906
00:53:14,674 --> 00:53:17,871
Drop, Lily,
it's okay.

907
00:53:23,316 --> 00:53:25,079
Please let
this work.

908
00:53:25,852 --> 00:53:31,119
Best friends, today,
tomorrow and always.

909
00:53:48,308 --> 00:53:49,468
Liana,

910
00:53:50,210 --> 00:53:51,336
where are we?

911
00:53:52,179 --> 00:53:55,342
In trouble, but then,
what else is new?

912
00:53:56,516 --> 00:53:57,710
What happened?

913
00:53:57,784 --> 00:53:59,376
Lydia has Melody.

914
00:53:59,453 --> 00:54:00,545
No!

915
00:54:00,620 --> 00:54:02,747
They're on their way
to the Diamond Castle.

916
00:54:02,823 --> 00:54:05,917
We have to stop
them, but how?

917
00:54:06,460 --> 00:54:08,451
We're going
to climb up,

918
00:54:08,528 --> 00:54:09,790
together.

919
00:54:22,075 --> 00:54:25,533
If you want me to believe
the Diamond Castle is here,

920
00:54:25,612 --> 00:54:27,079
give me the key.

921
00:54:27,147 --> 00:54:28,274
The key...

922
00:54:28,983 --> 00:54:31,315
Now, or I throw
you in the pond

923
00:54:31,386 --> 00:54:33,684
and your friends never
come out of the cave.

924
00:54:34,689 --> 00:54:36,418
The key...

925
00:54:39,193 --> 00:54:41,491
Is to place diamonds

926
00:54:42,063 --> 00:54:43,360
in the diamond.

927
00:54:43,431 --> 00:54:44,989
And that is...

928
00:54:45,066 --> 00:54:46,055
The boulder.

929
00:54:48,536 --> 00:54:50,766
Ah, I see it.

930
00:54:51,038 --> 00:54:52,403
Now what?

931
00:54:52,473 --> 00:54:54,634
Each slot
holds a diamond.

932
00:54:54,709 --> 00:54:56,404
Placed in
the proper order,

933
00:54:56,477 --> 00:54:58,707
the castle will
then be revealed.

934
00:54:58,780 --> 00:55:00,748
Where do I begin?

935
00:55:02,283 --> 00:55:05,252
I'm so sorry, Liana,
about everything I said.

936
00:55:06,053 --> 00:55:08,419
Me, too.
Me, too.

937
00:55:22,470 --> 00:55:24,233
Lily, come back.

938
00:55:30,678 --> 00:55:32,579
Whoa!

939
00:55:36,985 --> 00:55:38,077
Jeremy.

940
00:55:38,153 --> 00:55:39,415
Liana.

941
00:55:39,555 --> 00:55:41,921
I see you'll
follow us anywhere.

942
00:55:41,990 --> 00:55:44,891
Look at that. Again you show
up just when we need you.

943
00:55:45,494 --> 00:55:47,689
Timing is
everything.

944
00:55:54,102 --> 00:55:55,091
Here.

945
00:55:55,170 --> 00:55:56,262
Mmm-hmm.

946
00:55:56,338 --> 00:55:58,636
And then to the
right, two spaces.

947
00:55:58,707 --> 00:56:00,265
Ooh, the last one.

948
00:56:00,642 --> 00:56:02,633
So horribly exciting.

949
00:56:23,131 --> 00:56:26,123
Where's
the castle?

950
00:56:26,802 --> 00:56:29,896
You see, there are
a few more steps.

951
00:56:33,408 --> 00:56:36,003
You actually think
this mad plan will work?

952
00:56:36,212 --> 00:56:37,304
It has to.

953
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:40,781
Once Lydia finds the castle and
destroys the musical instruments,

954
00:56:40,850 --> 00:56:43,148
nobody will ever
be able to stop her.

955
00:56:44,687 --> 00:56:46,177
What you think,
Ian?

956
00:56:46,256 --> 00:56:49,350
Doom, disaster,
catastrophe.

957
00:56:49,425 --> 00:56:51,359
So, we're in then?

958
00:56:51,427 --> 00:56:52,894
Definitely.

959
00:56:59,202 --> 00:57:01,432
You've been
playing with me.

960
00:57:01,504 --> 00:57:02,493
I just...

961
00:57:02,572 --> 00:57:04,199
Diamonds aren't
the key at all.

962
00:57:04,274 --> 00:57:06,868
You think your friends
will come rescue you.

963
00:57:06,943 --> 00:57:08,706
You fool.

964
00:57:08,778 --> 00:57:12,680
You can't be the only
Muse, Lydia, it isn't right.

965
00:57:12,749 --> 00:57:15,309
The Diamond Castle's
meant for everybody.

966
00:57:15,385 --> 00:57:18,115
Great singers don't need a chorus.

967
00:57:26,563 --> 00:57:27,894
Mistress?

968
00:57:27,964 --> 00:57:30,694
Go, Slyder,
and make it snappy.

969
00:58:04,969 --> 00:58:07,164
Slyder,
what is it?

970
00:58:08,205 --> 00:58:09,229
What?

971
00:58:09,306 --> 00:58:10,295
So far...

972
00:58:10,374 --> 00:58:11,534
So good.

973
00:58:11,809 --> 00:58:14,710
Oh, I knew
they'd come.

974
00:58:14,778 --> 00:58:16,678
A waste of a trip.

975
00:58:28,359 --> 00:58:29,883
Come to me.

976
00:58:30,127 --> 00:58:32,721
No, don't
listen to her.

977
00:58:42,073 --> 00:58:44,007
Back off,
beastie.

978
00:58:51,983 --> 00:58:53,951
I liked
that guitar.

979
00:59:00,158 --> 00:59:03,252
Into the water
and drown.

980
00:59:03,695 --> 00:59:06,823
No! Liana,
Alexa, stop!

981
00:59:06,898 --> 00:59:08,058
Stop!

982
00:59:10,702 --> 00:59:11,862
How did you...

983
00:59:11,936 --> 00:59:13,995
Do you believe
in magic?

984
00:59:15,407 --> 00:59:17,773
My flute, now,
or I break the mirror,

985
00:59:17,842 --> 00:59:19,901
then she never
gets out, never.

986
00:59:19,978 --> 00:59:21,138
Wait!

987
00:59:21,212 --> 00:59:22,440
The flute.

988
00:59:22,614 --> 00:59:25,174
Don't do it.
Don't let her have it.

989
00:59:25,250 --> 00:59:27,844
You sound like someone who
wants to stay in there forever.

990
00:59:27,919 --> 00:59:31,355
No, but I will
to stop you.

991
00:59:32,691 --> 00:59:34,352
No!
Melody!

992
00:59:34,426 --> 00:59:36,394
Pathetic child.

993
00:59:39,698 --> 00:59:40,687
Give it
to me.

994
00:59:42,868 --> 00:59:44,267
Save Melody!

995
00:59:58,851 --> 01:00:00,978
Hey, Slyder,
over here.

996
01:00:11,597 --> 01:00:13,622
Nice serpent.

997
01:00:36,088 --> 01:00:37,112
Nice.

998
01:00:37,590 --> 01:00:38,989
Nice.

999
01:00:57,010 --> 01:00:58,944
Well done,
mate.

1000
01:00:59,513 --> 01:01:01,003
All in a
day's work.

1001
01:01:01,681 --> 01:01:03,808
You good girls.

1002
01:01:32,445 --> 01:01:33,434
No!

1003
01:01:38,118 --> 01:01:40,518
No! No! No!

1004
01:01:41,154 --> 01:01:42,382
No!

1005
01:01:49,564 --> 01:01:51,862
I... I can't
believe it.

1006
01:01:51,933 --> 01:01:53,025
She's gone.

1007
01:01:55,336 --> 01:01:58,203
It's over,
finally over.

1008
01:01:58,873 --> 01:02:01,433
Melody, can
you hear us?

1009
01:02:02,043 --> 01:02:03,510
Everybody all right?

1010
01:02:03,578 --> 01:02:05,011
Lydia's gone,

1011
01:02:05,780 --> 01:02:07,145
but so is
Melody.

1012
01:02:08,883 --> 01:02:11,716
There must be some way
to bring Melody back.

1013
01:02:14,388 --> 01:02:16,879
The Muses'
instruments might do it.

1014
01:02:17,158 --> 01:02:19,820
But we don't have the key
to the Diamond Castle.

1015
01:02:19,894 --> 01:02:24,354
I hate to be a spoil sport,
but I don't see any Diamond Castle.

1016
01:02:27,802 --> 01:02:29,633
I believe it's here.

1017
01:02:30,204 --> 01:02:32,866
How can you believe
what you don't see?

1018
01:02:34,008 --> 01:02:36,340
Sometimes what's real...

1019
01:02:37,678 --> 01:02:40,476
Is something
you can't see.

1020
01:02:40,848 --> 01:02:44,181
What if Melody's
song is the key?

1021
01:02:46,120 --> 01:02:48,953
<i>Hidden beneath the ground</i>

1022
01:02:49,390 --> 01:02:51,293
<i>Is the spring</i>

1023
01:02:51,294 --> 01:02:52,827
<i>That feeds the creek</i>

1024
01:02:54,096 --> 01:02:57,065
<i>Invisible as the wind</i>

1025
01:02:58,200 --> 01:03:01,294
<i>That you feel</i>
<i>Upon your cheek</i>

1026
01:03:01,970 --> 01:03:05,736
<i>And every breeze that whispers</i>

1027
01:03:05,807 --> 01:03:09,140
<i>Reminds us constantly</i>

1028
01:03:09,578 --> 01:03:11,512
<i>Sometimes what's real</i>

1029
01:03:11,580 --> 01:03:16,984
<i>Is something you can't see</i>

1030
01:03:17,219 --> 01:03:18,914
<i>Believe</i>

1031
01:03:18,987 --> 01:03:21,012
<i>In all that can be</i>

1032
01:03:21,089 --> 01:03:22,920
<i>A miracle starts</i>

1033
01:03:22,991 --> 01:03:24,891
<i>Whenever you dream</i>

1034
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:26,689
<i>Believe</i>

1035
01:03:26,762 --> 01:03:28,491
<i>And sing from your heart</i>

1036
01:03:28,563 --> 01:03:30,463
<i>You'll see</i>

1037
01:03:31,066 --> 01:03:35,025
<i>Your song will hold the key</i>

1038
01:05:20,611 --> 01:05:23,409
Liana, Alexa.

1039
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:53,175
Don't you
look precious?

1040
01:05:58,248 --> 01:06:00,877
Not a word about
this to anyone.

1041
01:06:08,560 --> 01:06:09,822
Home.

1042
01:06:25,009 --> 01:06:27,068
Ian, have
you see this?

1043
01:06:33,318 --> 01:06:36,116
The Muses' instruments are up here.

1044
01:06:52,003 --> 01:06:53,868
If we play the
instruments now?

1045
01:06:53,938 --> 01:06:56,133
The Muses
will come home.

1046
01:06:58,343 --> 01:06:59,776
Lydia!

1047
01:07:02,580 --> 01:07:04,640
Quick,
the instruments.

1048
01:07:11,524 --> 01:07:12,513
No!

1049
01:07:24,870 --> 01:07:26,497
<i>Believe</i>

What?

1058
01:07:43,189 --> 01:07:44,178
No!

1059
01:07:44,256 --> 01:07:45,951
<i>Your song will hold the key</i>

1060

<i>Believe</i>

1061
01:07:47,226 --> 01:07:49,660

<i>Believe</i>

1074
01:08:19,859 --> 01:08:21,383
What happened?

1075
01:08:29,803 --> 01:08:32,033
You're a tough
act to follow.

1076
01:08:54,761 --> 01:08:56,922
Liana, Alexa

1077
01:08:56,997 --> 01:09:00,626
for the beautiful music in
your hearts, which saved us all,

1078
01:09:00,700 --> 01:09:03,430
we anoint you
Princesses of Music.

1079
01:09:05,005 --> 01:09:06,438
Thank you.

1080
01:09:06,539 --> 01:09:08,404
No, thank you.

1081
01:09:08,475 --> 01:09:12,003
Without your sacrifices,
we would not be here.

1082
01:09:17,818 --> 01:09:19,911
And this is
for you, Melody.

1083
01:09:19,987 --> 01:09:22,012
You are no longer
an apprentice.

1084
01:09:22,089 --> 01:09:23,784
You are
a true Muse.

1085
01:09:25,126 --> 01:09:26,559
Thank you.

1086
01:09:27,194 --> 01:09:29,628
You have proven
your worth.

1087
01:09:29,697 --> 01:09:33,565
You now replace Lydia
as the third Muse.

1088
01:09:45,212 --> 01:09:47,442
For your courage and kind aid.

1089
01:09:49,250 --> 01:09:50,512
Thank you.

1090
01:09:50,584 --> 01:09:52,211
Many thanks.

1091
01:09:52,653 --> 01:09:53,642
Odd looking.

1092
01:09:56,257 --> 01:09:58,157
Whoa!

1093
01:10:05,366 --> 01:10:06,958
Wicked!

1094
01:10:09,003 --> 01:10:10,334
Oh, right.

1095
01:10:12,007 --> 01:10:13,474
Will you stay with us?

1096
01:10:13,542 --> 01:10:15,305
We can have rooms
near each other.

1097
01:10:15,377 --> 01:10:17,641
Live in this
beautiful castle?

1098
01:10:19,715 --> 01:10:22,741
Once, I would have said
yes in the blink of an eye,

1099
01:10:22,818 --> 01:10:25,810
but now, I just want
my old home back.

1100
01:10:26,722 --> 01:10:28,189
It was more
than enough.

1101
01:10:29,057 --> 01:10:31,252
We thought you might say that.

1102
01:10:33,428 --> 01:10:35,726
Plant these in
your garden at home.

1103
01:10:38,633 --> 01:10:40,726
<i>

1104
01:10:45,674 --> 01:10:50,976
<i>It's not an accident</i>
<i>The time we spent apart</i>

1105
01:10:51,046 --> 01:10:55,676
<i>But now we're so close</i>
<i>I can always find you</i>

1106
01:10:55,751 --> 01:10:59,585
<i>Right here in my heart</i>

1107
01:11:00,322 --> 01:11:04,019
<i>You've given me</i>
<i>Something I need</i>

1108
01:11:04,793 --> 01:11:07,421
<i>And I don't ever</i>
<i>Want it to end</i>

1109
01:11:07,496 --> 01:11:09,361
<i>Because of you</i>

1110
01:11:09,431 --> 01:11:12,559
<i>I know I've found</i>
<i>My strength again</i>

1111
01:11:12,634 --> 01:11:15,399
<i>I feel connected</i>
<i>Connected</i>

1112
01:11:15,471 --> 01:11:17,371
<i>Protected</i>
<i>Protected</i>

1113
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:20,807
<i>It's like you're sitting</i>
<i>Right with me all the time</i>

1114
01:11:20,877 --> 01:11:22,606
<i>You hear me</i>
<i>You hear me</i>

1115
01:11:22,678 --> 01:11:24,612
<i>You're near me</i>
<i>You're near me</i>

1116
01:11:24,680 --> 01:11:27,979
<i>And everything else</i>
<i>Is gonna be all right</i>

1117
01:11:28,050 --> 01:11:30,211
<i>'Cause nothing can break this</i>

1118
01:11:30,286 --> 01:11:32,015
<i>Nothing can break this</i>

1119
01:11:32,088 --> 01:11:35,148
<i>Nothing can break this tie</i>

1120
01:11:35,224 --> 01:11:37,089
<i>Connected</i>

1121
01:11:38,795 --> 01:11:42,356
<i>Connected inside</i>

1122
01:11:46,269 --> 01:11:48,829
Do you suppose
they need an escort?

1123
01:11:48,905 --> 01:11:51,635
Someone has to keep
them out of trouble.

1124
01:11:52,442 --> 01:11:54,034
Goodbye.

1125
01:11:54,143 --> 01:11:55,974
Farewell.
- Farewell.

1126
01:11:56,045 --> 01:11:57,307
Thank you.

1127
01:11:57,380 --> 01:11:59,245
I'll come visit.

1128
01:13:17,561 --> 01:13:20,759
I would have hated it if
Alexa and Liana didn't make up.

1129
01:13:20,965 --> 01:13:22,227
Me, too.

1130
01:13:22,300 --> 01:13:24,291
Best friends
stick together.

1131
01:13:25,637 --> 01:13:29,129
Do you think Courtney's
sorry for what she said?

1132
01:13:29,207 --> 01:13:31,198
Only one way
to find out.

1133
01:13:31,276 --> 01:13:32,641
What do
you think?

1134
01:13:32,710 --> 01:13:34,644
I'm sorry for
what I said.

1135
01:13:34,712 --> 01:13:36,612
Maybe you should
tell her that.

1136
01:13:37,282 --> 01:13:38,579
Yeah...

1137
01:13:39,484 --> 01:13:41,111
Yeah.

1138
01:13:41,352 --> 01:13:42,717
Thanks, Barbie.

1139
01:13:42,787 --> 01:13:44,049
Bye, Teresa.

1140
01:13:47,425 --> 01:13:48,687
Well done.

1141
01:13:49,561 --> 01:13:51,426
Timing is
everything.

1142
01:13:52,130 --> 01:13:53,961
Now, where were we?
