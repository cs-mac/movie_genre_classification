1
00:01:38,078 --> 00:01:41,289
No can do, James.

2
00:01:41,331 --> 00:01:44,209
<i>- What do you mean "no can do"?
- You know why.</i>

3
00:01:44,251 --> 00:01:46,211
No, I don't. Tell me.

4
00:01:46,253 --> 00:01:48,380
You're not supposed to eat this stuff.

5
00:01:48,421 --> 00:01:51,675
Okay. Look.

6
00:01:51,758 --> 00:01:53,969
Crisp $20 bill. Come on.

7
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:56,513
I can't do it.

8
00:01:56,596 --> 00:01:59,015
Dick...

9
00:01:59,099 --> 00:02:01,017
I support you.

10
00:02:01,101 --> 00:02:03,645
I come here.
I could go to those corporate stores.

11
00:02:03,728 --> 00:02:06,523
<i>No. I come to you,
the small businessman.</i>

12
00:02:06,606 --> 00:02:09,776
I'm here to see you.
Support you.

13
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:14,322
- Okay. One last time.
- One last time. Here you go.

14
00:02:14,406 --> 00:02:16,992
- I got a question for you.
- What?

15
00:02:17,075 --> 00:02:19,911
You got chocolate.
Why no rice pudding?

16
00:02:19,995 --> 00:02:21,913
- Why don't I carry it?
- Yeah.

17
00:02:21,997 --> 00:02:25,250
I don't like it.
In fact, I have an aversion to it.

18
00:02:26,293 --> 00:02:30,255
So if you didn't like milk,
then you wouldn't carry milk.

19
00:02:30,297 --> 00:02:33,049
If I don't like it,
how can I recommend it?

20
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,681
Well, I thank you, my friend.

21
00:02:39,764 --> 00:02:41,766
Say hi to your mother.

22
00:03:35,737 --> 00:03:38,281
You're going without saying good-bye?

23
00:03:38,365 --> 00:03:40,325
I'm sorry, Ma. Good-bye.

24
00:03:40,367 --> 00:03:43,828
You're not gonna
wear that shirt, are you?

25
00:03:43,912 --> 00:03:47,791
- Don't you see that's not even a question?
- That shirt makes you look fat.

26
00:03:47,874 --> 00:03:51,294
- That's because I am fat.
- You're not fat.

27
00:03:51,378 --> 00:03:53,922
If anything, I make the shirt look fat.

28
00:03:54,005 --> 00:03:56,258
Your snoring is getting louder.

29
00:03:56,341 --> 00:04:00,971
<i>I can hear it even with the door closed
and a pillow over my head.</i>

30
00:04:02,514 --> 00:04:05,100
I don't know what to tell ya.

31
00:04:05,183 --> 00:04:07,561
<i>Bye, Ma.</i>

32
00:04:07,644 --> 00:04:10,188
Bye.

33
00:04:10,272 --> 00:04:12,190
All right.
Here's your clipboard.

34
00:04:12,274 --> 00:04:14,568
When you go in, you tell him
you're from the government.

35
00:04:14,651 --> 00:04:16,570
- Right?
- From the government.

36
00:04:16,611 --> 00:04:18,738
- What did I just say?
- From the government.

37
00:04:18,822 --> 00:04:21,324
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Okay. Why do I have an empty metal clipboard?

38
00:04:21,366 --> 00:04:24,160
Because there's a hidden
microphone up there. See?

39
00:04:24,244 --> 00:04:26,955
<i>- Hold it high.
- Well, why is there no paper in it?</i>

40
00:04:27,038 --> 00:04:29,583
What do you know from paper?

41
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:32,460
Now go into the showroom
and ask for Bill Bango.

42
00:04:32,544 --> 00:04:36,548
<i>Then you ask Bill Bango,
'Are you the same Bill Bango...</i>

43
00:04:36,631 --> 00:04:39,676
"who used to ride hotrods
at Lake Geneva in the '70s?

44
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:44,139
<i>'And we know that Bill Bango
knew someone named Vicki Seberg.</i>

45
00:04:44,222 --> 00:04:48,185
We know you had relations with Vicki Seberg,
and you have a long-lost daughter."

46
00:04:48,268 --> 00:04:49,644
Really?

47
00:04:49,728 --> 00:04:52,063
He's a prick car dealer.
What do you care?

48
00:04:53,148 --> 00:04:55,108
Well, where are the cameras?

49
00:04:55,192 --> 00:04:58,195
Cameras?
What are you, a producer now?

50
00:04:59,237 --> 00:05:01,531
Never mind the cameras.

51
00:05:02,574 --> 00:05:04,576
Jesus.

52
00:05:10,123 --> 00:05:12,042
- Can I help you?
- Yeah.

53
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:15,170
Uh, I'm looking for, uh, Bill Bango.

54
00:05:15,212 --> 00:05:17,005
You mean Bill Bjango?

55
00:05:17,088 --> 00:05:19,507
I thought it was Bango.

56
00:05:19,549 --> 00:05:22,510
No. It's Bjango.

57
00:05:24,512 --> 00:05:28,767
Bill Bjango. Bill Bjango,
customer to see you in the showroom.

58
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,729
Where did the term
"dealership" come from?

59
00:05:32,771 --> 00:05:35,732
- I don't know.
- Just wondering.

60
00:05:35,815 --> 00:05:37,943
What about tent sales?

61
00:05:38,026 --> 00:05:40,862
What is it about tents
that make people wanna buy cars?

62
00:05:54,292 --> 00:05:56,503
May I help you, sir?

63
00:05:56,586 --> 00:05:59,297
- Bill Bango?
- It's Bjango.

64
00:05:59,381 --> 00:06:03,635
Yeah. Um, Mr. Bjango,
I'm, uh, Rory Rorerson.

65
00:06:03,718 --> 00:06:05,971
What can I do for you, Mr. Rorerson?

66
00:06:06,012 --> 00:06:08,014
Uh, I'm from the government and, uh...

67
00:06:08,098 --> 00:06:11,977
Are you the same Bill Bjango that raced
hotrods up at Lake Geneva in the '70s?

68
00:06:12,018 --> 00:06:14,104
- That's me.
- Okay. Do you remember a woman...

69
00:06:14,187 --> 00:06:16,439
named, uh, Vicki Seberg?

70
00:06:16,523 --> 00:06:18,441
Vicki Seberg. Whoa.

71
00:06:18,525 --> 00:06:21,862
<i>- You know, I knew a lot of gals back then.
- Yeah, well, um...</i>

72
00:06:21,945 --> 00:06:24,239
here's where it gets a little bit messy.

73
00:06:24,322 --> 00:06:27,909
It appears you had relations
with Miss Seberg back then, and, uh...

74
00:06:27,993 --> 00:06:29,995
from that, um...

75
00:06:30,078 --> 00:06:33,123
devil-may-care moment
came a, uh... a-a daughter.

76
00:06:37,168 --> 00:06:40,505
Did you say I have... Did you say I have...
have a... have a daughter?

77
00:06:40,589 --> 00:06:42,799
Yes. I also said "devil-may-care."

78
00:06:42,883 --> 00:06:44,801
I said...

79
00:06:44,885 --> 00:06:45,969
Cue the girl.

80
00:06:46,011 --> 00:06:47,512
- Is she...
- Daddy!

81
00:06:47,596 --> 00:06:50,599
- Oh.
- Oh, I have missed you.

82
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:53,435
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

83
00:06:53,476 --> 00:06:56,104
This is great.

84
00:06:56,188 --> 00:06:57,814
Oh, Daddy.

85
00:07:01,526 --> 00:07:05,322
I don't know what...
what... what to say.

86
00:07:05,405 --> 00:07:07,616
What to... What to say.

87
00:07:07,699 --> 00:07:09,868
Mr. Bjango.
Mr. Bjango.

88
00:07:09,951 --> 00:07:14,414
I'm, uh, not really from the government...

89
00:07:14,497 --> 00:07:17,042
<i>and, uh, she's not really your daughter.</i>

90
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:20,795
- She's not... not my daughter?
- No, she's not your daughter.

91
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:25,008
<i>We're from a TV show called SmearJob,
and this has all been a joke.</i>

92
00:07:25,091 --> 00:07:27,302
Joke?

93
00:07:31,389 --> 00:07:34,309
- It's not funny, sir.
- I know it's not funny.

94
00:07:34,392 --> 00:07:36,728
<i>- Not funny.
- I'm-I'm-I'm terribly sorry.</i>

95
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:38,730
<i>I...</i>

96
00:07:39,731 --> 00:07:42,025
It's not funny.

97
00:07:44,569 --> 00:07:47,113
<i>- I'm not enjoying this.
- What? What's not to enjoy?</i>

98
00:07:47,197 --> 00:07:49,491
You got the whole fat guy thing
all wrapped up.

99
00:07:49,574 --> 00:07:52,577
I mean, who else is out there
who's fat and funny? Huh?

100
00:07:52,661 --> 00:07:54,746
Being fat has nothing to do with
why I'm funny.

101
00:07:54,829 --> 00:07:58,542
Okay. I got ya. I got ya. Anyway,
there's a couple eating in the back, okay?

102
00:07:58,625 --> 00:08:01,670
<i>I want you to go up there and pretend
that you're a government agent...</i>

103
00:08:01,753 --> 00:08:04,965
and you tell them you've got proof
that the guy's cheating on her.

104
00:08:05,966 --> 00:08:09,678
- This is disturbing. You know that, right?
- What's disturbing? It'll be funny.

105
00:08:09,761 --> 00:08:14,015
Funny, funny, funny. And you make sure
that it's the guy who's doing the cheating.

106
00:08:14,099 --> 00:08:16,726
- Otherwise it's not funny.
- How do you know that?

107
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:19,396
Not me. It's research.
Our research tells us...

108
00:08:19,479 --> 00:08:22,190
that people think it's funnier
if the guy is cheating.

109
00:08:22,274 --> 00:08:25,193
Okay. Now once I tell them he's cheating,
what do I do after that?

110
00:08:25,235 --> 00:08:29,072
Whatever you say will be great.
You are a multitalented young man.

111
00:08:29,155 --> 00:08:31,491
Oh. There you go.

112
00:08:31,575 --> 00:08:33,493
- Clipboard. Paper.
- All right?

113
00:08:33,577 --> 00:08:34,744
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Okay.

114
00:08:34,828 --> 00:08:37,414
<i>- Thank you.
- Okay. Go get 'em, you little pisher.</i>

115
00:08:37,497 --> 00:08:40,125
Oh, yeah.

116
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:45,505
<i>- So you don't work here at the store?
- Not really. No.</i>

117
00:08:45,547 --> 00:08:48,508
You'll have to forgive her.

118
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:52,804
It's just that she shows up every day
and does more work than our paid employees do.

119
00:08:52,888 --> 00:08:55,307
So we kind of just let her stay.

120
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:58,101
- Did you need to be in a line?
- Um...

121
00:08:58,185 --> 00:09:00,729
Well, wouldn't you know?

122
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:03,899
I just think that...

123
00:09:03,982 --> 00:09:05,901
this is not a good thing.

124
00:09:07,402 --> 00:09:09,321
Well, why not?

125
00:09:09,404 --> 00:09:12,490
I just don't feel that you and I
are on the same page.

126
00:09:12,532 --> 00:09:15,619
Okay, Susie von Cliche,
what are you talking about?

127
00:09:15,702 --> 00:09:17,871
You're 39,
and you live with your mother.

128
00:09:17,954 --> 00:09:19,539
Yeah?

129
00:09:19,623 --> 00:09:21,917
You're in terrible shape.
You don't care about how you look.

130
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,213
I care about how I look. There's a matter
of pride as I get dressed every day.

131
00:09:26,296 --> 00:09:30,091
<i>I'm gonna get in shape. That's part of the plan.
And I'm gonna move out of my mom's.</i>

132
00:09:30,175 --> 00:09:33,011
I told you this wouldn't work.
We work together.

133
00:09:35,514 --> 00:09:38,141
- It's because I'm fat.
- It is not because you're fat.

134
00:09:38,225 --> 00:09:40,477
<i>Don't do this because...</i>

135
00:09:41,645 --> 00:09:43,647
I love you.

136
00:09:43,688 --> 00:09:45,857
I love you.
And I've always loved you.

137
00:09:45,941 --> 00:09:48,652
Ever since you started working here,
l- I've been in love with you.

138
00:09:48,735 --> 00:09:50,695
You don't love me.

139
00:09:52,572 --> 00:09:55,325
<i>Maybe I do.</i>

140
00:09:55,367 --> 00:09:57,827
You don't know.
How do you know?

141
00:10:00,288 --> 00:10:03,500
Hi. I'm leaving right now.
I'll be there in a minute. Bye.

142
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:05,502
- Who's that?
- None of your business.

143
00:10:05,585 --> 00:10:08,046
- I thought you were going straight home.
- I have to meet somebody.

144
00:10:08,088 --> 00:10:10,674
- A guy?
- l... I'm leaving.

145
00:10:10,757 --> 00:10:12,175
So it's over.

146
00:10:12,259 --> 00:10:14,553
Whatever it was, it's over.

147
00:10:51,089 --> 00:10:53,091
Hey. Where were you?

148
00:10:54,384 --> 00:10:56,678
- Out.
- Where?

149
00:10:57,679 --> 00:10:59,681
None of your business.

150
00:11:11,276 --> 00:11:13,278
<i>Hi, Mom.</i>

151
00:11:13,361 --> 00:11:16,198
Hi, honey. How was your day?

152
00:11:16,239 --> 00:11:18,241
Fine.

153
00:11:19,284 --> 00:11:24,331
Even when you were a little boy,
whenever I asked you "How was your day?"...

154
00:11:24,414 --> 00:11:27,083
you always said, "Fine."

155
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:29,127
It was fine.

156
00:11:30,503 --> 00:11:33,298
- Are you hungry?
- Mmm, not really.

157
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:35,508
I made some kugel.

158
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,845
All right. Maybe one piece.

159
00:12:09,376 --> 00:12:11,920
- James.
- Luca.

160
00:12:15,131 --> 00:12:17,133
Somebody's probably sick.

161
00:12:18,635 --> 00:12:21,054
- Nobody's sick.
- Why else would they not be open?

162
00:12:21,137 --> 00:12:23,265
'Cause they're closed.

163
00:12:23,348 --> 00:12:26,518
- They're closed. Yeah. Yeah.
- They're closed.

164
00:12:26,601 --> 00:12:29,062
Next time you come here,
it's gonna be a bank.

165
00:12:29,145 --> 00:12:31,022
<i>Look at that floor.
You see that floor?</i>

166
00:12:31,064 --> 00:12:33,358
It's a beautiful floor.

167
00:12:33,441 --> 00:12:36,486
All that stone was cut by hand
by some immigrant.

168
00:12:36,528 --> 00:12:38,655
Irish guy, or Italian.

169
00:12:38,697 --> 00:12:41,741
Like in the '30s or something.
Worked hard.

170
00:12:41,825 --> 00:12:44,703
Made every piece fit in that floor.

171
00:12:44,786 --> 00:12:47,497
Go home at night.

172
00:12:47,581 --> 00:12:49,541
A little place.
A wife.

173
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:53,420
<i>Maybe a couple kids.
It's a great floor.</i>

174
00:12:53,503 --> 00:12:56,923
All right. I've been coming here for years...
with my dad, with my grandfather.

175
00:12:57,007 --> 00:13:00,802
- Never noticed the floor.
- That's part of the problem.

176
00:13:02,512 --> 00:13:05,473
What, you're writing me up
for never noticing the floor?

177
00:13:05,515 --> 00:13:07,601
Writing a note.

178
00:13:12,647 --> 00:13:14,649
<i>We need a new place to eat.</i>

179
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:18,361
- That's a big ball of Purim.
- What's Purim?

180
00:13:18,445 --> 00:13:22,324
- It's kind of like a Jewish Halloween.
- Oh.

181
00:13:37,422 --> 00:13:40,675
There is nothing hotter
than an angry Frenchwoman.

182
00:13:41,927 --> 00:13:43,887
No.

183
00:13:43,929 --> 00:13:46,640
Yowza. Wow.

184
00:13:46,723 --> 00:13:48,642
Where you wanna go? Waffle King?

185
00:13:48,725 --> 00:13:51,937
- King of the cinnamon waffle.
- I hate the Waffle King.

186
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:56,983
No. You hate the Waffle King's son.
Uh, Kenny G-lookin' guy who mixes the fruit.

187
00:13:57,067 --> 00:13:58,985
- Yeah.
- IHOP?

188
00:13:59,069 --> 00:14:01,071
IHOP? No.

189
00:14:01,154 --> 00:14:03,114
Guess not.

190
00:14:03,198 --> 00:14:07,452
- Man, the girls around here are way hot.
- Yeah. It's a nice neighborhood.

191
00:14:08,453 --> 00:14:11,039
<i>- Look at that. See the cornices up there?
- Yeah.</i>

192
00:14:11,122 --> 00:14:13,083
<i>Nice Romanesque vaulting.</i>

193
00:14:16,294 --> 00:14:18,505
<i>- They don't make this anymore.
- You love Chicago.</i>

194
00:14:18,588 --> 00:14:22,759
<i>I do. I know. Manny's.</i>

195
00:14:22,842 --> 00:14:26,930
Manny's is great,
but my car is up by Wrigley Field.

196
00:14:26,972 --> 00:14:29,599
- Why is it up by Wrigley?
- I found a great space.

197
00:14:29,683 --> 00:14:32,644
But you don't live by Wrigley.
Shouldn't your car be near where you live?

198
00:14:32,727 --> 00:14:35,188
Yeah, but I got a great space.

199
00:14:42,821 --> 00:14:46,116
Nothing hotter than
an elderly angry Filipino woman.

200
00:14:46,199 --> 00:14:48,451
- Nothing in the world.
- Nothing in the world.

201
00:14:51,329 --> 00:14:54,875
- Look at that.
- Arrgh, matey. Get your hot dogs.

202
00:14:55,917 --> 00:14:57,836
Get your hot dogs. Arrgh.

203
00:14:57,919 --> 00:15:01,298
What does being a pirate
have to do with hot dogs?

204
00:15:01,381 --> 00:15:03,341
That's sad.

205
00:15:04,593 --> 00:15:06,887
- Why a pirate?
- I don't know. Let's go find out.

206
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:09,681
- Let's go ask him.
- I gotta go to the bank.

207
00:15:09,764 --> 00:15:12,851
All right. You go to the bank.
I'm gonna find out why he's a pirate.

208
00:15:12,893 --> 00:15:14,895
- Find out.
- All right.

209
00:15:14,978 --> 00:15:17,147
<i>Thank you, ladies. Arrgh.</i>

210
00:15:22,527 --> 00:15:24,988
Hey, James.

211
00:15:25,071 --> 00:15:27,282
- Yeah?
- Larry.

212
00:15:27,365 --> 00:15:29,492
- Larry?
- It's...

213
00:15:29,534 --> 00:15:31,745
- Larry?
- It's Larry.

214
00:15:31,828 --> 00:15:33,872
<i>- What are you doing? You're dressed like a pirate.
- Yeah.</i>

215
00:15:33,955 --> 00:15:37,459
<i>- What does pirates have to do with hot dogs?
- Listen. You gotta do me a big favor.</i>

216
00:15:37,542 --> 00:15:40,462
<i>I got a big audition at 11:00,
and my boss won't let me leave...</i>

217
00:15:40,545 --> 00:15:43,131
unless I get somebody to cover for me.

218
00:15:43,173 --> 00:15:45,967
- Not me.
- Come on, man. You owe me.

219
00:15:46,051 --> 00:15:48,011
<i>- Well, what's the audition for?
- Uh, Marty.</i>

220
00:15:48,053 --> 00:15:49,638
<i>Marty?</i>

221
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:51,723
<i>- Yeah, Marty.
- Paddy Chayefsky's Marty?</i>

222
00:15:51,806 --> 00:15:53,350
I guess.

223
00:15:55,477 --> 00:15:57,687
<i>Why would they remake Marty?
That makes no sense.</i>

224
00:15:57,771 --> 00:16:00,649
<i>Marty's a perfect movie.
Won an Academy Award.</i>

225
00:16:00,732 --> 00:16:02,776
Ernest Borgnine won an Academy Award.

226
00:16:02,859 --> 00:16:06,780
I even have the video version with Rod Steiger.
I've seen it a million times.

227
00:16:06,821 --> 00:16:08,823
It takes place in New York, not Chicago.

228
00:16:08,907 --> 00:16:11,785
My reading's this afternoon.

229
00:16:14,412 --> 00:16:16,581
- Who's the casting director?
- Burl Canasta.

230
00:16:16,623 --> 00:16:19,751
Burl Canasta?
He loves me.

231
00:16:19,834 --> 00:16:22,295
<i>Why didn't Burl Canasta bring me in?
I'm perfect for Marty.</i>

232
00:16:22,379 --> 00:16:25,382
<i>- That makes no sense.
- Would you cover for me?</i>

233
00:16:25,465 --> 00:16:28,343
<i>I've always wanted to do anything by
Paddy Chayefsky. Now they're remaking Marty.</i>

234
00:16:28,426 --> 00:16:31,680
<i>- Wait. Who is Paddy Chayefsky?
- Who's Paddy Chayefsky?</i>

235
00:16:31,763 --> 00:16:33,723
He's one of the greatest writers
that's ever lived.

236
00:16:33,765 --> 00:16:36,017
<i>He wrote Marty.
He won an Academy Award for it.</i>

237
00:16:36,101 --> 00:16:38,353
<i>- I'm sorry. I didn't know.
- He also wrote Network.</i>

238
00:16:38,395 --> 00:16:41,106
Is that the movie where everyone,
uh, yells out the window?

239
00:16:41,189 --> 00:16:43,775
Yes. That's what it's about,
people yelling out the window.

240
00:16:43,859 --> 00:16:46,194
<i>- Yeah, I didn't see it. I remember it.
- Oh, that's beautiful.</i>

241
00:16:46,236 --> 00:16:48,196
Please do me this one favor.
You owe me.

242
00:16:48,238 --> 00:16:51,032
<i>You ripped the cover
on my Silver Surfer number one.</i>

243
00:16:51,074 --> 00:16:53,577
- I told you I'd pay you back.
- When?

244
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:56,371
Well, I'd much rather pay you back.

245
00:16:56,413 --> 00:16:59,875
Look it. You cover for me,
and we'll call it even.

246
00:17:15,891 --> 00:17:18,768
- Can I have two?
- Sure.

247
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:20,770
- Do you have mustard?
- No.

248
00:17:20,812 --> 00:17:22,772
Oh, then I don't want any.

249
00:17:31,448 --> 00:17:34,784
Hey, little fella. Why you wearin' a poncho?
It's so nice out.

250
00:17:34,868 --> 00:17:37,662
Whenever I'm bad,
my dad makes me wear it.

251
00:17:37,704 --> 00:17:39,623
Ah. How about a hot dog?

252
00:17:39,706 --> 00:17:43,126
<i>- Sure.
- Hey. Come back here.</i>

253
00:17:43,168 --> 00:17:46,171
- Did you say thank you to the man?
- No.

254
00:17:46,213 --> 00:17:48,757
That's another week in the poncho.

255
00:17:51,009 --> 00:17:53,386
Where's Larry?

256
00:17:53,428 --> 00:17:57,098
<i>- He's at an audition.
- Oh, the Marty audition.</i>

257
00:17:57,182 --> 00:17:59,184
Yeah.

258
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:04,564
You know,
I think I'd make a great Marty.

259
00:18:04,648 --> 00:18:07,526
Yeah, yeah, but you're a pirate now.

260
00:18:08,527 --> 00:18:10,487
You hungry?

261
00:18:10,529 --> 00:18:13,281
- Yes.
- Have a hot dog.

262
00:18:13,365 --> 00:18:16,034
No, thank you. I don't eat nitrates.

263
00:18:17,077 --> 00:18:20,664
All right. You wanna cover for me?
I'll give you, like, 10 bucks.

264
00:18:20,747 --> 00:18:23,291
I'd like to, but all I got is my dignity.

265
00:18:35,512 --> 00:18:37,764
Yeah. James Aaron for Herb.

266
00:18:40,392 --> 00:18:42,853
I'm sure he is. Okay. Yeah.

267
00:18:44,938 --> 00:18:46,982
- Name an actress.
- Huh?

268
00:18:47,065 --> 00:18:48,984
Name an actress.

269
00:18:50,068 --> 00:18:52,612
<i>- Why?
- Just do it.</i>

270
00:18:52,696 --> 00:18:55,198
All right. Um, uh...

271
00:18:55,282 --> 00:18:57,200
Gwyneth Paltrow.

272
00:18:57,284 --> 00:18:59,536
Been naked in the movies five times.

273
00:18:59,619 --> 00:19:04,457
<i>Actually, she had a body double
in 1998's Hush.</i>

274
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:06,543
So, actually, four times.

275
00:19:06,626 --> 00:19:07,836
Name another.

276
00:19:07,878 --> 00:19:11,006
- All right. Julianne Moore.
- Naked five times.

277
00:19:11,089 --> 00:19:14,801
She holds the record
for the longest bush shot...

278
00:19:14,885 --> 00:19:18,513
<i>in 1993's Short Cuts...</i>

279
00:19:18,597 --> 00:19:21,516
for one minute, 24 seconds.

280
00:19:21,558 --> 00:19:23,560
By the way,
it happens at the 2:17 mark.

281
00:19:23,602 --> 00:19:25,562
- Come on. Come and get me.
- I'll take note.

282
00:19:25,604 --> 00:19:28,732
<i>- Do you do this with Larry?
- Oh, all the time. He's good.</i>

283
00:19:28,773 --> 00:19:32,861
<i>That's... That's quite a talent you have.
That's really good.</i>

284
00:19:32,944 --> 00:19:35,822
Hey. Hey. Hey.

285
00:19:35,906 --> 00:19:38,491
<i>- Hmm.
- Yeah.</i>

286
00:19:38,575 --> 00:19:43,455
I just wanted to see how it would feel to be
desperate enough to do something like this.

287
00:19:43,496 --> 00:19:45,707
And how's that feel?

288
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:47,334
Like my life.

289
00:19:47,417 --> 00:19:49,794
Let's get going. I'm starved.

290
00:19:49,878 --> 00:19:51,796
<i>Hey. Hold on one second.
Before we leave...</i>

291
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:54,174
tell this gentleman an actress's name.

292
00:19:54,257 --> 00:19:57,594
<i>Wait, wait, wait.
And make it sort of obscure.</i>

293
00:19:57,677 --> 00:20:00,597
Don't go with Gina Gershon,
'cause that's too easy for what he does.

294
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,599
- Kay Lenz.
- Kay Lenz!

295
00:20:02,682 --> 00:20:04,601
Just out of nowhere. Kay Lenz.
Very good.

296
00:20:04,684 --> 00:20:07,812
Great ass.
Naked five times.

297
00:20:07,896 --> 00:20:12,234
<i>The best movie to see her naked in
is 1973's Breezy.</i>

298
00:20:13,276 --> 00:20:15,278
Directed by Mr. Clint Eastwood.

299
00:20:16,279 --> 00:20:19,533
Bonus note!
She was married to David Cassidy.

300
00:20:21,076 --> 00:20:24,287
- Let's go. I'm starving.
- All right. Here you go, Mr. Skin.

301
00:20:24,329 --> 00:20:26,748
I told you. I don't eat nitrates.

302
00:20:31,378 --> 00:20:33,380
- Thank you.
- Mmm.

303
00:20:34,381 --> 00:20:36,383
You always eat so healthy,
yet you're still fat.

304
00:20:36,466 --> 00:20:38,343
<i>- I don't know why.
- Hmm.</i>

305
00:20:40,929 --> 00:20:45,225
- Wanna go to the Cubs game?
- No, I can't. I gotta go to work. It's movie day.

306
00:20:45,308 --> 00:20:48,270
<i>We're showing The Party, and I'm the only
one who knows how to run the projector.</i>

307
00:20:48,353 --> 00:20:50,272
<i>- I love The Party.
- Great movie.</i>

308
00:20:50,355 --> 00:20:53,441
Yeah. Kind of falls apart, though,
when they start washing the elephant.

309
00:20:53,525 --> 00:20:55,902
See, now I like it when they wash
the elephant. It's trippy.

310
00:20:55,986 --> 00:20:57,445
<i>- Trippy?
- Mm-hmm.</i>

311
00:20:57,529 --> 00:20:59,072
All right. Maybe I'll come by.

312
00:21:00,365 --> 00:21:04,494
Gotta get going. Hey. Don't forget.
Career day at Penelope's school.

313
00:21:04,578 --> 00:21:07,330
All right. I'm there.
Now, um, why aren't you going?

314
00:21:07,372 --> 00:21:09,958
She didn't ask for me.
She asked for you.

315
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,587
I run a retirement home. You're an actor.
What's more interesting to a seven-year-old?

316
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:15,714
I don't know.

317
00:21:15,797 --> 00:21:19,092
- I gotta take my pumpkin muffin and get going.
- You got a pumpkin muffin? Good for you.

318
00:21:19,134 --> 00:21:20,677
- Yeah.
- You know what? My treat.

319
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,179
<i>- Really?
- As a matter of fact...</i>

320
00:21:22,262 --> 00:21:24,681
from now on,
whenever you get a pumpkin muffin...

321
00:21:24,764 --> 00:21:26,850
<i>- years from now, my treat.
- You sure?</i>

322
00:21:26,892 --> 00:21:29,519
<i>- Oh, I'm Mr. Pumpkin Muffin. It's all done.
- Carrot muffin?</i>

323
00:21:29,603 --> 00:21:32,439
No, not carrot muffin.
Not chocolate. Not blueberry.

324
00:21:32,522 --> 00:21:35,901
Corn muffin too.
Corn and pumpkin on me.

325
00:21:35,942 --> 00:21:39,362
Like, if I get it with a... a whole meal?

326
00:21:40,405 --> 00:21:42,866
- No. Just the pumpkin muffin part.
- All right. Thanks.

327
00:21:42,949 --> 00:21:44,910
See you later, man.

328
00:21:52,584 --> 00:21:53,668
Hi.

329
00:21:53,752 --> 00:21:55,837
<i>- Hi.
- What are you reading?</i>

330
00:21:55,921 --> 00:21:57,881
Huxley.

331
00:21:57,964 --> 00:22:00,550
<i>The guy who wrote, uh,
The Doors of Perception.</i>

332
00:22:00,634 --> 00:22:02,511
You've read him?

333
00:22:02,594 --> 00:22:07,015
No. Actually, I read a book about the Doors
and it said that's how they got their name. That's...

334
00:22:09,351 --> 00:22:11,853
- The band the Doors.
- I know.

335
00:22:12,896 --> 00:22:16,358
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
Well, I'm starting a diet today.

336
00:22:16,399 --> 00:22:19,194
<i>- Good for you.
- Oh.</i>

337
00:22:19,277 --> 00:22:21,655
<i>What I do is,
the night before I go on a diet...</i>

338
00:22:21,738 --> 00:22:25,033
I go to the store and get every piece
of crap junk food in the universe...

339
00:22:25,075 --> 00:22:29,204
and the next morning I start fresh by having
a half a cantaloupe and some melba toast.

340
00:22:42,425 --> 00:22:46,763
Hi, I'm Marsha, compulsive overeater,
grateful, uh, recovering bulimic.

341
00:22:46,847 --> 00:22:48,849
<i>Hi, Marsha.</i>

342
00:22:48,932 --> 00:22:51,560
Well, um, as most of you know,
I just got a promotion.

343
00:22:51,601 --> 00:22:55,313
And, uh, because of that, I'm supposed to
do some work out of my home.

344
00:22:55,397 --> 00:22:58,149
Um, that's not been a problem
till last night.

345
00:22:58,233 --> 00:23:03,113
Uh, Joey, my neighbor,
was blasting his stereo, and, um...

346
00:23:03,196 --> 00:23:05,866
he plays Tom Jones all the time.

347
00:23:05,949 --> 00:23:09,953
So I went over to his apartment,
uh, to tell him, uh, to turn it down.

348
00:23:10,036 --> 00:23:13,582
And he invites me in, uh,
to, uh, finish my work.

349
00:23:13,665 --> 00:23:18,003
And before you know it, I'm in his place,
I'm not getting my work done...

350
00:23:18,086 --> 00:23:21,923
and as a matter of fact,
I'm listening to "What's New, Pussycat?"...

351
00:23:22,007 --> 00:23:24,426
drinking cocoa and eating cookies.

352
00:23:24,509 --> 00:23:26,845
<i>Um...</i>

353
00:23:26,928 --> 00:23:28,847
<i>I didn't get my work done.</i>

354
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:31,766
At least I didn't sleep with Joey.
I mean, that's another whole story.

355
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:34,144
I don't even want to get into that.

356
00:23:34,227 --> 00:23:37,355
Uh, but, uh,
I'm really happy you're all here...

357
00:23:37,439 --> 00:23:41,776
and that I have these rooms to walk in
and not feel alone.

358
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:45,488
And for today, right now, I'm abstinent.

359
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:48,158
And that's all I want to say.

360
00:23:48,241 --> 00:23:50,243
Thanks.

361
00:23:52,078 --> 00:23:55,582
Would anyone else like to share?

362
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,641
<i>Okay. Um...</i>

363
00:24:12,724 --> 00:24:16,478
how about we end the meeting
with five minutes of silent meditation.

364
00:24:45,549 --> 00:24:48,218
<i>dd</i>

365
00:25:08,029 --> 00:25:10,740
- Hi.
- One second.

366
00:25:10,824 --> 00:25:13,451
Okay. Take your time.

367
00:25:17,873 --> 00:25:20,083
- l... You're from Second City.
- Yeah.

368
00:25:20,166 --> 00:25:22,127
- You're funny.
- Wow. Thank you.

369
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:25,589
- You're really funny.
- Oh, look at you. Thank you very much. Thank you.

370
00:25:25,672 --> 00:25:28,133
- I'm James.
- Beth.

371
00:25:28,175 --> 00:25:30,927
<i>Beth. Pleasure.
What you makin'?</i>

372
00:25:31,011 --> 00:25:33,263
Uh, I just made the banana cookie train.

373
00:25:33,346 --> 00:25:35,557
<i>The banana cookie train.
Look at that. That's beautiful.</i>

374
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,893
But there's nobody here.

375
00:25:37,934 --> 00:25:41,188
I know. Well, this place is my sister's,
and I'm helping her out.

376
00:25:41,229 --> 00:25:45,150
- So when it's slow I have to, you know, make sure I can do everything on the menu.
- Wow.

377
00:25:45,233 --> 00:25:47,152
- Practice.
- What are you doing?

378
00:25:47,235 --> 00:25:48,862
I was throwing it away.

379
00:25:50,822 --> 00:25:53,491
I don't have to throw it away.

380
00:25:53,533 --> 00:25:57,454
- You could help me out and eat 'em.
- I could help you out and eat 'em.

381
00:25:57,495 --> 00:25:59,623
You are the most wonderful woman
who has ever lived.

382
00:25:59,706 --> 00:26:02,000
- Enjoy.
- Gosh.

383
00:26:02,083 --> 00:26:06,296
The last thing I need to do now is start obsessing
about the hot girl with the free ice cream.

384
00:26:06,379 --> 00:26:08,757
<i>- Yeah. That's the last thing you need, right?
- Yeah.</i>

385
00:26:08,798 --> 00:26:11,510
You know,
it used to be okay to obsess and say...

386
00:26:11,593 --> 00:26:14,262
"I'm never gonna give up.
I'm gonna make her love me."

387
00:26:14,346 --> 00:26:17,849
But now I'm too old.
If I did it, I'd be thrown in jail for stalking.

388
00:26:17,933 --> 00:26:20,268
- I had a stalker once.
- Yeah?

389
00:26:20,352 --> 00:26:24,439
Yeah. His name was Mick. He called me every day
for, like, a year, and I didn't even know him.

390
00:26:24,523 --> 00:26:28,068
- What did he want?
- He wanted me to pay off my student loan.

391
00:26:28,151 --> 00:26:30,403
<i>dd</i>

392
00:26:30,487 --> 00:26:32,489
Well, that's not really stalking.

393
00:26:32,572 --> 00:26:37,661
No, but I did. I paid it after, like, a week, and he
kept calling me, 'cause he, you know, liked me.

394
00:26:37,744 --> 00:26:40,163
He never even saw you, and he liked you.
How about that?

395
00:26:40,247 --> 00:26:42,249
- It's pretty good.
- Yeah.

396
00:26:46,419 --> 00:26:48,630
- James.
- Yeah?

397
00:26:49,714 --> 00:26:51,716
You ever give a girl a hoagie shack?

398
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:55,303
Huh? A hoagie shack?
What's that?

399
00:26:55,387 --> 00:27:00,183
That's when you take your wiener and you
sandwich it between the bosoms of a lady.

400
00:27:00,267 --> 00:27:03,061
I sandwich my wiener
between the bosoms of a lady?

401
00:27:03,103 --> 00:27:05,063
<i>Exact... Yeah.
You're a guy.</i>

402
00:27:05,105 --> 00:27:07,732
You never had a nice little
old-fashioned hoagie shack?

403
00:27:10,193 --> 00:27:12,237
Where do you get this stuff from?

404
00:27:14,155 --> 00:27:16,074
Well, I gotta get back to work.

405
00:27:21,246 --> 00:27:23,623
Actually, no, I never have.

406
00:27:23,665 --> 00:27:25,917
Oh.

407
00:27:28,587 --> 00:27:31,840
- Ooh. How's your ice cream?
- Good.

408
00:27:31,882 --> 00:27:34,301
Yay!

409
00:27:39,347 --> 00:27:42,100
You know what?
I'm gonna get going.

410
00:27:42,142 --> 00:27:44,102
<i>- Okay.
- Yeah. Yeah.</i>

411
00:27:44,144 --> 00:27:48,356
Um, thank you, though, very much
for the free ice cream.

412
00:27:48,398 --> 00:27:50,400
- My pleasure. Anytime.
- All right.

413
00:27:50,483 --> 00:27:52,485
Come back again.

414
00:27:55,614 --> 00:27:58,241
- So, yes.
- I don't know.

415
00:27:58,325 --> 00:28:00,869
Well, do you think that she, uh...

416
00:28:00,952 --> 00:28:03,872
- I couldn't possibly know.
- What do you mean you couldn't possibly know?

417
00:28:03,914 --> 00:28:06,791
- I wasn't there, but it seems like perhaps...
- I told you all the information.

418
00:28:06,875 --> 00:28:10,170
I know. It seems like an offer to me,
but I wasn't there for her intonation.

419
00:28:10,253 --> 00:28:14,132
- Well, bosoms and wiener...
- Yeah, well, it's got all the earmarks of an offer.

420
00:28:14,174 --> 00:28:16,092
- It does have the earmarks of an offer.
- Yes.

421
00:28:16,134 --> 00:28:19,095
Wow. What a... What a strange term.
"Hoagie shack."

422
00:28:19,179 --> 00:28:21,139
Never heard of it.

423
00:28:22,182 --> 00:28:24,226
- Hoagie shack.
- Hoagie shack.

424
00:28:24,309 --> 00:28:26,353
Hoagie shack.
Hoagie shack.

425
00:28:26,394 --> 00:28:28,438
- I can't stop staying it now.
- Hoagie shack.

426
00:28:28,522 --> 00:28:31,733
- Hey, mister, hows about a hoagie shack?
- Have you ever done a hoagie shack?

427
00:28:31,775 --> 00:28:34,528
I've never done... I've never heard of
a hoagie shack before, much less...

428
00:28:34,611 --> 00:28:38,240
- So it's not just me. It would freak you out too.
- Oh, I would be taken aback. Yes.

429
00:28:38,323 --> 00:28:41,826
Okay. So I'm not, like, you know, a loser
for not going, "Hey, we'll hoagie shack later."

430
00:28:41,910 --> 00:28:45,705
No. It's understandable, but you
should have, yes, taken her up on it.

431
00:28:45,747 --> 00:28:48,833
- But how do you do that in an ice cream parlor?
- You lead the life.

432
00:28:48,917 --> 00:28:52,254
Hot dogs, ice cream, hoagie shacks.
You got it all.

433
00:28:52,295 --> 00:28:54,214
- I do, don't I?
- Man.

434
00:28:54,297 --> 00:28:55,632
- I'm lucky.
- Man.

435
00:28:55,715 --> 00:28:58,468
- All right.
- One of these days you're gonna have responsibilities.

436
00:28:59,678 --> 00:29:01,972
Get the hoagie shack while you can.
That's what I say.

437
00:29:02,013 --> 00:29:04,891
- Hey. How about my tape measure?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

438
00:29:07,853 --> 00:29:09,813
- Why are there no pictures on the walls?
- It's out of respect.

439
00:29:09,855 --> 00:29:12,232
Out of respect? I've never gotten that.
What does that mean?

440
00:29:12,315 --> 00:29:15,777
- It's out of resp... What do you want?
- Come on. There's nothing going on in your office.

441
00:29:15,861 --> 00:29:18,446
It's an office. It's not a photo gallery.
What do you want?

442
00:29:18,530 --> 00:29:22,534
<i>Okay. Listen to me. Number one, why didn't I
get an audition for Marty with Burl Canasta?</i>

443
00:29:22,576 --> 00:29:25,704
I did submit you, and Burl Canasta
said that you're not right for the role.

444
00:29:25,745 --> 00:29:29,749
Not right for the role? I know for a fact
my friend Larry Albert had an audition today.

445
00:29:29,833 --> 00:29:34,462
- If he had an audition, it was for the movie. It wasn't for the role of Marty. What else you need?
- Okay.

446
00:29:34,546 --> 00:29:38,508
Your sister. She broke up with me.
Doesn't wanna go out with me anymore.

447
00:29:38,592 --> 00:29:41,011
- I didn't know you two were serious.
- She never talked about it?

448
00:29:41,094 --> 00:29:43,013
Listen. Listen.

449
00:29:43,096 --> 00:29:46,224
I know this is a bad time,
but I'm dropping you as a client.

450
00:29:46,308 --> 00:29:50,520
I'm sorry about you and my sister,
but, uh, I'm not kidding.

451
00:29:50,604 --> 00:29:53,231
What's with your family?
Why now?

452
00:29:53,315 --> 00:29:57,402
- Because you're feeling pain from a similar thing.
- What does that mean?

453
00:29:57,485 --> 00:30:02,782
Well, it means that, uh, it's better to have
one big pain than two separate pains.

454
00:30:02,866 --> 00:30:06,077
You know, why spread it out?
Just get it over with. One big pain.

455
00:30:06,161 --> 00:30:09,039
- That's insane.
- You know what's insane?

456
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:13,168
The fact that you keep turning down auditions
because they're not up to your standards.

457
00:30:13,251 --> 00:30:15,045
Well, I'd rather wait tables
than do crappy work.

458
00:30:15,128 --> 00:30:17,547
- Have you ever waited tables?
- No.

459
00:30:17,631 --> 00:30:19,758
Exactly.
This is Chicago, my friend.

460
00:30:19,841 --> 00:30:22,344
It's not New York.
It's not L.A.

461
00:30:22,427 --> 00:30:24,346
You can't be picky.

462
00:30:24,429 --> 00:30:26,848
<i>Who are you to screw up
some show like SmearJob?</i>

463
00:30:26,932 --> 00:30:29,434
That wasn't acting.
That was pure evil.

464
00:30:29,518 --> 00:30:32,896
<i>That's what the name should have been:
Pure Evil, brought to you by the devil.</i>

465
00:30:32,938 --> 00:30:36,191
It was money. You know how many shows
are shot in Chicago?

466
00:30:37,484 --> 00:30:39,402
One?

467
00:30:39,486 --> 00:30:43,365
I used to think you were terrific.
I used to think you were great.

468
00:30:43,448 --> 00:30:45,367
Boy, was I wrong.

469
00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:48,078
You're like a first round draft pick
that goes bust.

470
00:30:48,161 --> 00:30:50,080
I'm sorry.

471
00:30:52,290 --> 00:30:54,251
You're not sorry.

472
00:30:56,211 --> 00:30:58,171
I'm a little sorry.

473
00:31:07,097 --> 00:31:09,349
Hey, where were you?

474
00:31:09,432 --> 00:31:11,726
- Out.
- Where?

475
00:31:11,810 --> 00:31:13,770
None of your business.

476
00:31:19,526 --> 00:31:21,486
I was at Gustav's Meats today.

477
00:31:22,529 --> 00:31:25,991
This meat is as tender
as he said it would be.

478
00:31:26,992 --> 00:31:29,244
Anyway, you know his daughter Maria.

479
00:31:29,327 --> 00:31:31,079
No.

480
00:31:31,121 --> 00:31:34,082
- No, what?
- No, I won't go out with her.

481
00:31:34,165 --> 00:31:36,668
- I never said that.
- That's what you were going to say.

482
00:31:36,751 --> 00:31:38,962
- I was not gonna say that.
- Oh, you were going to.

483
00:31:39,045 --> 00:31:41,381
No. I wasn't because...

484
00:31:41,464 --> 00:31:45,093
she got married last weekend.

485
00:31:45,135 --> 00:31:46,970
And?

486
00:31:47,053 --> 00:31:48,638
And there you are.

487
00:31:50,098 --> 00:31:52,851
- You know, Ma, I'm gonna get going.
- But you haven't finished your dinner.

488
00:31:52,934 --> 00:31:54,853
I'm not hungry.

489
00:31:55,979 --> 00:31:57,981
Yes, I am.

490
00:32:25,467 --> 00:32:27,427
Ooh. Oh.

491
00:32:27,469 --> 00:32:30,055
- No way.
- You don't really want that album, do you?

492
00:32:30,138 --> 00:32:33,725
- Ben Webster. Were you gonna get it?

493
00:32:33,808 --> 00:32:35,936
Well, yeah, but you know Ben Webster?

494
00:32:36,019 --> 00:32:37,938
Well, I don't "know him" know him.

495
00:32:38,021 --> 00:32:40,440
My dad was a big fan
of Duke Ellington's...

496
00:32:40,524 --> 00:32:44,528
and, you know, he loves his version of
"Danny Boy," and I love "Tenderly," so...

497
00:32:44,611 --> 00:32:47,614
I wasn't even looking for this.
I just saw it. If you wanna get it...

498
00:32:47,697 --> 00:32:51,868
<i>- Ben and Sweets is a great album. If you don't have it, you should get it.
- No... I know. I mean...</i>

499
00:32:51,952 --> 00:32:54,412
- But I don't wanna take it if you...
- No. Hey, hey. Um...

500
00:32:54,454 --> 00:32:57,457
<i>isn't there, like, a Ben Webster box set
that's due out soon?</i>

501
00:32:57,541 --> 00:33:01,753
Yeah. It's coming in like, uh, two weeks.
I got, uh, three comin'.

502
00:33:01,837 --> 00:33:05,048
Great. Great, great.
Can I, uh, put, uh, one on hold?

503
00:33:05,131 --> 00:33:07,342
Yeah, I could,
but I think you'll be just fine.

504
00:33:07,425 --> 00:33:10,512
I don't think there's gonna be a big rush
on the Ben Webster box sets.

505
00:33:10,595 --> 00:33:12,848
Big rush?
Take a look, my friend.

506
00:33:12,931 --> 00:33:15,934
Mini-rush right now.
Your hair's blowin' back as we come at ya.

507
00:33:16,017 --> 00:33:17,978
- Very good.
- Two of us.

508
00:33:18,061 --> 00:33:20,564
- No, go ahead and... and get it. Please.
- Are you sure?

509
00:33:20,605 --> 00:33:22,566
- Yeah. Please.
- That is so sweet of you.

510
00:33:22,607 --> 00:33:25,443
- What's your name?
- Stella.

511
00:33:25,527 --> 00:33:27,988
Stella. So your dad liked,
uh, Miles Davis too.

512
00:33:28,029 --> 00:33:31,491
Yeah. Or a big Marlon Brando fan.
I've never quite figured that out.

513
00:33:31,533 --> 00:33:33,577
- What's your name? I'm sorry.
- I'm James.

514
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:35,620
- James.
- Yeah. Nice meeting you, Stella.

515
00:33:35,662 --> 00:33:37,622
- Nice meeting you.
- Yeah.

516
00:33:37,664 --> 00:33:41,001
- Well, enjoy it. You're gonna love it.
- Oh, thanks.

517
00:33:41,084 --> 00:33:43,503
Sure. All right. Um...

518
00:33:43,545 --> 00:33:45,505
You're not getting anything?

519
00:33:45,547 --> 00:33:48,508
No. l... l... l... I'm gonna come back.
I'll get the box set.

520
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:50,510
It'll be here. There won't be a rush.

521
00:33:50,552 --> 00:33:53,013
- Okay. I'll... I'll... I'll get it.
- Oh. There you go.

522
00:33:53,054 --> 00:33:57,100
- So, well, nice meeting you, Stella.
- Nice meeting you, James.

523
00:33:57,184 --> 00:33:59,352
- Take care.
- Thank you. You too.

524
00:34:05,692 --> 00:34:08,904
Kind of neat, two people
looking for Ben Webster.

525
00:34:08,987 --> 00:34:11,489
Isn't it?

526
00:34:11,573 --> 00:34:13,533
Well, I think it is.

527
00:34:36,014 --> 00:34:37,974
Are you looking for me?

528
00:34:38,016 --> 00:34:40,185
Oh, uh...

529
00:34:40,268 --> 00:34:42,604
I live upstairs.

530
00:34:42,687 --> 00:34:44,231
Oh.

531
00:34:44,314 --> 00:34:47,025
<i>- Did you want some more ice cream?
- Uh, no, no, no.</i>

532
00:34:47,108 --> 00:34:50,904
You know what? I really gotta stop eating
ice cream. I need to lose some weight.

533
00:34:50,987 --> 00:34:55,033
- Yeah. I used to be chubby when I was a little girl.
- Yeah, but I'm not a little girl.

534
00:34:55,116 --> 00:34:56,993
No, you're a big girl.

535
00:34:57,077 --> 00:34:59,329
Big, pretty girl.

536
00:34:59,371 --> 00:35:02,123
Does the big, pretty girl
wanna go for a walk?

537
00:35:02,207 --> 00:35:04,709
Sure. Yeah.

538
00:35:13,552 --> 00:35:16,304
- Have you seen Marty?
- Marty who?

539
00:35:16,388 --> 00:35:19,432
- No, it's a movie. It's my favorite movie.
- Oh. No.

540
00:35:20,433 --> 00:35:23,019
- Do you like rice puddin'?
- No.

541
00:35:23,103 --> 00:35:25,063
I haven't tried it, but l... No.

542
00:35:25,146 --> 00:35:27,691
Oh, you'd love it.
You don't know what you're missing.

543
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:32,779
How come you don't
have a girlfriend, James?

544
00:35:33,947 --> 00:35:35,949
I don't know how to answer that.

545
00:35:36,032 --> 00:35:38,243
l... l... I, uh, um...

546
00:35:38,326 --> 00:35:40,453
I don't know.

547
00:35:40,495 --> 00:35:42,414
Have you ever had a relationship?

548
00:35:42,497 --> 00:35:44,457
Um...

549
00:35:44,541 --> 00:35:46,459
a couple.

550
00:35:46,543 --> 00:35:50,297
Uh, let's see here.
Uh, there was, uh, one girl at camp.

551
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:53,175
Um, but that was imaginary.

552
00:35:53,258 --> 00:35:56,094
Um, and then, uh, let's see here.

553
00:35:56,094 --> 00:35:58,471
Um...

554
00:35:58,513 --> 00:36:01,892
Yeah. There's my agent's sister.
But that was more of a thing.

555
00:36:01,933 --> 00:36:03,977
She really didn't have
that much interest in me.

556
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:06,563
How about you?

557
00:36:06,605 --> 00:36:09,941
No. No relationships. Just sex.

558
00:36:09,983 --> 00:36:13,653
Or... Or one... I did have one relationship
with a girl in college.

559
00:36:13,695 --> 00:36:16,031
- Really?
- It... Hmm, yeah.

560
00:36:16,114 --> 00:36:18,575
Well, she was a woman.
She was my women's studies professor.

561
00:36:18,658 --> 00:36:21,077
Well, tell me more about
your hot lesbian professor.

562
00:36:21,161 --> 00:36:23,121
It wasn't. It was... She...

563
00:36:23,205 --> 00:36:25,624
It was just during college,
and I only went out with her...

564
00:36:25,665 --> 00:36:28,168
'cause she looked like Barry Gibb,
and I love the Bee Gees.

565
00:36:28,251 --> 00:36:31,254
And I am no longer interested in the story.

566
00:36:33,381 --> 00:36:35,926
<i>As an adult, I've never really been on a picnic.</i>

567
00:36:36,009 --> 00:36:38,261
That's not really a picnic.

568
00:36:38,345 --> 00:36:41,848
They don't have the red-and-white
checkerboard cloth and the picnic basket.

569
00:36:44,059 --> 00:36:47,312
They're really just a couple
of young people in love eating cheese.

570
00:36:47,395 --> 00:36:50,732
Mmm, I want someone to eat cheese with.

571
00:36:50,774 --> 00:36:53,235
That's what I want.

572
00:36:53,276 --> 00:36:55,237
That's so simple. That's perfect.

573
00:36:55,278 --> 00:36:57,322
Although I'd probably prefer
rice pudding. I love...

574
00:36:57,405 --> 00:37:00,325
I'm telling you. You have no idea
what you're missing. It's so good.

575
00:37:02,702 --> 00:37:04,996
You wanna come with me
to buy some underwear?

576
00:37:06,081 --> 00:37:08,083
I was just thinking that.

577
00:37:09,334 --> 00:37:12,504
<i>dd</i>

578
00:37:15,423 --> 00:37:17,384

<i>Mmm. Delicioso.</i>

00:37:21,847 --> 00:37:23,807
Oh.

00:37:24,808 --> 00:37:26,726
You like this?

582
00:37:26,810 --> 00:37:28,728
- Chocolaty.
- Chocolaty.

583
00:37:28,812 --> 00:37:30,730
- Chocolaty.
- I'm trying this on.

584
00:37:30,814 --> 00:37:32,774
All right.

585
00:38:18,445 --> 00:38:20,363
<i>- Excuse me.
- Huh?</i>

586
00:38:20,405 --> 00:38:22,199
Your girlfriend wants to talk with you.

587
00:38:22,282 --> 00:38:24,951
<i>- Who?
- Your girlfriend.</i>

588
00:38:24,993 --> 00:38:27,370
Oh.

589
00:38:29,414 --> 00:38:31,374
<i>Come here.</i>

590
00:38:39,216 --> 00:38:41,426
<i>Come here.
I need you to see this.</i>

591
00:38:44,262 --> 00:38:46,264
I need to know what you think.

592
00:38:48,350 --> 00:38:50,519
<i>- It's great.
- You're not even looking.</i>

593
00:38:53,605 --> 00:38:55,982
Hey. It's... It's great.

594
00:38:56,024 --> 00:38:57,984
It's great.

595
00:38:58,026 --> 00:39:00,028
<i>All right.
I'm gonna try something else on.</i>

596
00:39:00,111 --> 00:39:01,821
I'm gonna need you to come back.

597
00:39:01,905 --> 00:39:04,574
Uh, okay.
I'll be right here.

598
00:39:14,459 --> 00:39:16,920
- You know what? I'm gonna go.
- Really?

599
00:39:16,962 --> 00:39:18,964
Yeah.

600
00:39:21,341 --> 00:39:23,885
I'll see ya tomorrow night
after your show.

601
00:40:06,219 --> 00:40:08,263
- There you are.
- Hey.

602
00:40:08,346 --> 00:40:11,141
Getting a little upset. Thought I was gonna
have to talk to 'em about being mayor.

603
00:40:11,224 --> 00:40:13,185
- Thank you.
- All right. Well, I'm here. I'm sorry.

604
00:40:13,268 --> 00:40:17,522
- Ms. Lewis, this is Penelope's uncle, James. James, this is Penelope's teacher, Ms. Lewis.
- Hi.

605
00:40:17,606 --> 00:40:19,608
- Stella.
- Yes.

606
00:40:19,691 --> 00:40:21,610
- From the record store. Wow.
- Mm-hmm.

607
00:40:21,693 --> 00:40:23,195
- You remember, huh?
- Yeah.

608
00:40:23,278 --> 00:40:26,656
Okay. Um, I just need to say Mr. So-and-So.
Your last name?

609
00:40:26,698 --> 00:40:32,204
- Oh, Aaron.
- Aaron. Oh. All right, kids. Okay. Kids.

610
00:40:32,287 --> 00:40:35,415
This is Mr. Aaron.
Say, "Hello, Mr. Aaron," right?

611
00:40:35,498 --> 00:40:37,417
Hi, Mr. Aaron.

612
00:40:37,501 --> 00:40:39,961
Come on, we can do better than that.
A round of applause.

613
00:40:40,003 --> 00:40:43,215
<i>- Hi, Mr. Aaron!
- Hi, kids. Hi, kids.</i>

614
00:40:43,215 --> 00:40:46,510
I'm, uh... I'm, uh,
Penelope's uncle.

615
00:40:46,593 --> 00:40:50,222
Well, I'm not really her uncle.
I'm actually her dad's best friend.

616
00:40:50,305 --> 00:40:52,682
But she calls me uncle.

617
00:40:54,434 --> 00:40:58,438
<i>Yeah. Well, uh, what do I do?
I'm an actor.</i>

618
00:40:58,522 --> 00:41:02,067
Uh, I've been doing this for about,
uh, 20 years now.

619
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:04,152
Wow. Twenty years.

620
00:41:04,236 --> 00:41:07,113
You would've thought I would have
made it already, you know?

621
00:41:07,197 --> 00:41:11,076
I mean, that's a long time, 20 years.
Did you hear they're remaking Marty?

622
00:41:11,159 --> 00:41:13,787
<i>Yeah. Remaking Marty.</i>

623
00:41:13,870 --> 00:41:16,581
I don't know why-why would they
remake Marty? Makes no sense.

624
00:41:16,623 --> 00:41:18,708
<i>I would've been a perfect Marty.</i>

625
00:41:18,792 --> 00:41:20,710
Question, yeah.
Go ahead, my friend.

626
00:41:20,794 --> 00:41:22,170
<i>- I'm bored.
- What?</i>

627
00:41:22,254 --> 00:41:24,297
- I'm bored.
- What?

628
00:41:24,381 --> 00:41:26,174
He's bored.

629
00:41:26,258 --> 00:41:28,718
Oh. All right.
Uh, bored. Um...

630
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:32,389
<i>All right, I'll try and, uh...
Let's see here. Um, okay, uh...</i>

631
00:41:32,472 --> 00:41:35,225
I should really keep going,
you know, not give up.

632
00:41:35,308 --> 00:41:37,519
Uh, I do work.
I'm not gonna say I don't work.

633
00:41:37,602 --> 00:41:41,815
<i>I do work. I was on a show
recently, uh... Get this.</i>

634
00:41:41,898 --> 00:41:45,193
It was supposed to be a funny show,
but I made people cry. Isn't that silly?

635
00:41:45,277 --> 00:41:49,114
<i>Made people cry on a funny show? Hmm.</i>

636
00:41:49,197 --> 00:41:54,077
l... You know, the really... The big
thing for me is, I need somebody to love.

637
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:58,123
I want somebody to love. That's the thing
that's missing for me, is somebody to love.

638
00:41:58,206 --> 00:42:01,042
And I did meet this one girl,
but she's kind of a nut-bag.

639
00:42:01,126 --> 00:42:04,171
Maybe I'm the nut-bag for digging her,
you know? Who knows?

640
00:42:04,254 --> 00:42:08,091
Do we really pick who we fall in love with
or does it just happen?

641
00:42:08,175 --> 00:42:11,428
You know, bottom line is,
I need to get laid.

642
00:42:15,182 --> 00:42:19,269
When I say "laid," I mean a nap.

643
00:42:19,352 --> 00:42:21,813
I need a nap right now.
Do they have a cot here?

644
00:42:21,855 --> 00:42:24,816
<i>'Cause I could just
lay down all day long.</i>

645
00:42:24,858 --> 00:42:28,945
While you guys are learning,
I could take a nap and, uh...

646
00:42:29,029 --> 00:42:33,575
You know, when I go to work sometimes,
I walk through the park.

647
00:42:33,658 --> 00:42:36,369
And when I'm walking
through the park I, um...

648
00:42:36,453 --> 00:42:41,666
I don't wanna step in doody,
and that's all that's in the park is doody.

649
00:42:41,750 --> 00:42:44,252
<i>Horse doody, dog doody, duck doody.</i>

650
00:42:44,294 --> 00:42:48,548
Bee doody. Bees make doody. They do.
There are just tons of doody.

651
00:42:48,632 --> 00:42:52,010
- Doody.
- And also, there's a guy I gotta avoid. You know why?

652
00:42:52,052 --> 00:42:55,472
On his nose, the biggest booger
in the world.

653
00:42:55,555 --> 00:42:57,599
<i>Yeah, that's right.</i>

654
00:42:57,641 --> 00:43:01,311
<i>His name? Baron von Booger.
That's his name.</i>

655
00:43:01,394 --> 00:43:03,313
<i>Oh.</i>

656
00:43:03,396 --> 00:43:05,815
<i>l- I'm sorry. I am.
I don't know where that came from.</i>

657
00:43:05,857 --> 00:43:08,818
Please. The kids don't know what
it means. Don't even worry about it.

658
00:43:08,902 --> 00:43:13,198
- I'm just so sorry.
- Please, I really... I understand.

659
00:43:14,241 --> 00:43:16,785
- Well, thanks.
- Yeah, I mean, who hasn't been there?

660
00:43:16,868 --> 00:43:20,914
You know what I mean? Where you think food or
sex somehow's gonna bring you some fulfillment.

661
00:43:20,997 --> 00:43:24,000
And then you just realize that
all we really want is some love.

662
00:43:24,084 --> 00:43:26,002
I mean, everybody feels that way,
don't you think?

663
00:43:26,086 --> 00:43:28,421
The other night I went to a restaurant
and I was ordering ice cream.

664
00:43:28,505 --> 00:43:30,423
I thought I'll just get a little something
to go, you know?

665
00:43:30,507 --> 00:43:33,426
I ordered, like, a whole pint,
and then I sat there at the counter eating it.

666
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:36,596
Then the guy from the hardware store
came in to... for a pie to go.

667
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:40,225
And I almost left with him.
That's just...

668
00:43:40,308 --> 00:43:42,727
You know what I mean.

669
00:43:42,811 --> 00:43:44,938
- Sure, I do. Sure, I do.
- Right.

670
00:43:45,021 --> 00:43:49,317
Yeah, I do. That's... I'm just embarrassed
about what happened, that's all.

671
00:43:49,401 --> 00:43:51,528
Don't be.
Don't be embarrassed.

672
00:43:51,570 --> 00:43:54,573
You know, when you're lonely,
you're lonely and...

673
00:43:54,614 --> 00:43:57,242
Do you have a couple minutes?

674
00:43:59,452 --> 00:44:02,831
Now I'm really embarrassed.
I have to be honest.

675
00:44:02,914 --> 00:44:05,917
Oh, God, no!
No, I didn't mean for that.

676
00:44:06,001 --> 00:44:08,628
Oh, I didn't mean that either.
I didn't know. I didn't mean that.

677
00:44:08,670 --> 00:44:11,173
Oh. I should shower right now,
just at the thought.

678
00:44:11,214 --> 00:44:13,216
- Y-You didn't mean that?
- No, I didn't mean that.

679
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:15,260
What did you mean?

680
00:44:15,302 --> 00:44:17,262
- I meant that. I did.
- Uh-huh.

681
00:44:17,304 --> 00:44:19,389
- I meant that because...
- Can you give me one minute?

682
00:44:19,472 --> 00:44:22,934
- Yes, I'll give you one minute.
- All right, good. Okay, I want you to meet somebody.

683
00:44:34,821 --> 00:44:36,823
Do you know why you're here?

684
00:44:36,907 --> 00:44:39,451
Uh, not really.

685
00:44:39,534 --> 00:44:42,746
Well, um, Ms. Lewis,
um, is actually concerned.

686
00:44:42,829 --> 00:44:46,875
- She said you had a misadventure.
- She said "misadventure"?

687
00:44:46,958 --> 00:44:50,504
Misadventure. Mm-hmm.
Is that true?

688
00:44:50,587 --> 00:44:54,216
I'd be careful if I were you, James.
She's a chubby chaser.

689
00:44:54,257 --> 00:44:58,637
- What's a chubby chaser?
- l... Never mind. I'm sorry. I just don't wanna get off track.

690
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:01,473
<i>Um, James, are you familiar with...</i>

691
00:45:01,556 --> 00:45:04,726
<i>the, uh, children's classic,
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory?</i>

692
00:45:04,809 --> 00:45:09,064
- Yeah.
- Okay. So you remember the oddity that was Augustus Gloop?

693
00:45:09,147 --> 00:45:12,150
The fat kid who fell
into the chocolate river.

694
00:45:12,234 --> 00:45:15,946
The fat kid who fell into
the chocolate river. He was a sloth.

695
00:45:16,029 --> 00:45:21,076
<i>A gluttonous sloth.
And despite being warned, he fell into...</i>

696
00:45:21,159 --> 00:45:24,496
<i>- The chocolate river.
- The chocolate river.</i>

697
00:45:24,538 --> 00:45:29,709
Jimmy, you are the chocolate river
of your life, all right?

698
00:45:29,793 --> 00:45:33,088
And I'm Oompa Loompa.
Hmm. Isn't that cute? I'm Oompa Loompa.

699
00:45:33,171 --> 00:45:36,174
<i>Please, I'm begging you,
do not fall in.</i>

700
00:45:36,216 --> 00:45:41,471
Do not go near the room where they make the
strawberry-flavored, chocolate-coated fudge.

701
00:45:43,223 --> 00:45:46,935
- I won't fall in.
- Well, then, okay.

702
00:45:46,977 --> 00:45:51,982
You can just tell Ms. Lewis that we had a chitchat
and that you come back and see me if you need to.

703
00:45:52,065 --> 00:45:54,776
And please don't tell her I told you
that she was a chubby chaser.

704
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:57,529
- I won't.
- Okay.

705
00:45:57,612 --> 00:45:59,656
Do you think I'm pretty?

706
00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:02,158
<i>I don't know what that means...</i>

707
00:46:03,952 --> 00:46:06,454
because I'm an old sharecropper.

708
00:46:06,496 --> 00:46:09,457
- But I'd love some of your corn.
- Yes, of course.

709
00:46:09,541 --> 00:46:13,712
It's funny you say sharecroppers,
and we're sharing a crop.

710
00:46:16,381 --> 00:46:21,178
How is it my little lady
and I are gonna get us some corn?

711
00:46:21,261 --> 00:46:24,472
Because, man, I love corn so much.

712
00:46:24,556 --> 00:46:30,020
It overwhelm me the way
I love the corn. I love the corn.

713
00:46:30,103 --> 00:46:35,650
Man, I remember as a little boy,
I sit on my grandpa's lap lovin' the corn.

714
00:46:35,734 --> 00:46:39,362
Excuse me. Do you have a washcloth
in your mouth?

715
00:46:39,446 --> 00:46:42,574
Why, you know what?
Let's take a look.

716
00:46:42,616 --> 00:46:46,161
l- I have not brushed my teeth
in over 40 years.

717
00:46:46,203 --> 00:46:51,917
There's a great possibility that
I could have a washcloth in my mouth.

718
00:46:55,086 --> 00:46:58,882
Hello.

719
00:47:19,027 --> 00:47:21,905
- Hi.
- Hi. Where do you want to go?

720
00:47:21,988 --> 00:47:24,824
All right, before we go anywhere
I wanna establish something.

721
00:47:24,866 --> 00:47:28,411
You are a huge-time hottie
and I am Baron von Fat.

722
00:47:28,495 --> 00:47:31,414
- You're not fat.
- And you're a little bit crazy.

723
00:47:31,456 --> 00:47:34,292
Where are we gonna go?
I'm cold.

724
00:47:34,376 --> 00:47:36,837
All right, come on.

725
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:39,214
Here's what we're gonna do.
This will be lots of fun.

726
00:47:39,256 --> 00:47:43,510
Um, let's go down the next aisle and when
we see each other, we'll do, like, a scenario.

727
00:47:43,593 --> 00:47:49,099
- Okay.
- All right, um, I'm gonna be your, um, 12th grade science teacher...

728
00:47:49,182 --> 00:47:51,434
who, uh... who failed you.

729
00:47:51,518 --> 00:47:54,062
And because he failed you, you didn't
get into the college that you wanted to.

730
00:47:54,145 --> 00:47:56,147
- And you're seeing me for the first time.
- Excellent.

731
00:47:56,231 --> 00:48:00,026
Cool. All right.
Um, by the way, I'm, uh, Mr. Johanssen.

732
00:48:11,121 --> 00:48:14,166
- Oh.
- Oh. Beth, is that you?

733
00:48:14,249 --> 00:48:16,293
Mr. Johanssen.

734
00:48:16,376 --> 00:48:20,755
You may call me Bill,
because we are both adults.

735
00:48:20,839 --> 00:48:23,091
<i>- Okay, Bill. Yeah.
- Hi.</i>

736
00:48:23,175 --> 00:48:26,136
- So how are you?
- I'm great.

737
00:48:26,178 --> 00:48:29,598
I just... I really wanna thank you
for failing me in that class.

738
00:48:29,681 --> 00:48:31,850
What?

739
00:48:31,933 --> 00:48:36,229
I'll explain. See, when you failed me,
I wasn't able to get into Northwestern.

740
00:48:36,271 --> 00:48:38,273
That was my number one school.

741
00:48:38,356 --> 00:48:41,484
So when I couldn't go to my number
one school, I got so depressed...

742
00:48:41,568 --> 00:48:43,904
I didn't even go to college.

743
00:48:43,945 --> 00:48:47,532
<i>- I am so sorry.
- Don't be sad, Bill.</i>

744
00:48:47,616 --> 00:48:51,036
Because once I got better,
once I came out of my funk...

745
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:53,622
I became Chicago's
number one crack whore.

746
00:48:54,706 --> 00:48:57,667
- The number one crack whore?
- Yeah.

747
00:48:57,751 --> 00:49:02,714
That is quite an accomplishment. You must
have done some things that are not clean.

748
00:49:02,797 --> 00:49:08,094
The scum of the earth of Chicago
has been inside me.

749
00:49:08,136 --> 00:49:12,974
<i>Oh. Well, I must go home
and experiment on self.</i>

750
00:49:13,016 --> 00:49:17,103
Oh, yeah. I have to go too. I'm very busy.
Very popular. Can't keep the tricks waiting.

751
00:49:17,187 --> 00:49:19,648
No, you cannot. Good-bye.

752
00:49:19,731 --> 00:49:22,567
- So long.
- Bye-bye.

753
00:49:22,651 --> 00:49:24,819
Bye.

754
00:49:24,903 --> 00:49:27,822
<i>- That was fun.
- Okay. Let's try this one.</i>

755
00:49:27,906 --> 00:49:30,951
Uh, um, I'm a, um...

756
00:49:30,992 --> 00:49:34,204
I'm a young cadet
fresh out of the academy...

757
00:49:34,287 --> 00:49:38,250
and you are a, um...
a hippie chick.

758
00:49:38,291 --> 00:49:40,252
<i>Different sides of the track.</i>

759
00:49:40,335 --> 00:49:43,547
I'm in full, uh, uniform. Okay?

760
00:49:43,630 --> 00:49:46,758
And you, uh... you love corn.

761
00:49:46,842 --> 00:49:49,386
<i>- I love corn.
- That's it.</i>

762
00:49:49,469 --> 00:49:51,429
I love corn.

763
00:49:59,145 --> 00:50:01,398
- Oh.
- Ma'am, you seem to have dropped this.

764
00:50:01,481 --> 00:50:04,067
Why, thank you, young cadet.

765
00:50:04,150 --> 00:50:07,571
- Groovy uniform.
- Groovy, ma'am?

766
00:50:07,612 --> 00:50:11,199
Yeah, groovy.
I'm a hippie chick...

767
00:50:11,241 --> 00:50:13,243
who loves corn.

768
00:50:15,245 --> 00:50:17,497
<i>Oh, man.</i>

769
00:50:17,581 --> 00:50:20,750
That was a lame one.
Okay, uh, they're not all great.

770
00:50:20,834 --> 00:50:23,253
Um, all right,
you think of the next one.

771
00:50:23,336 --> 00:50:27,215
Okay. Um... you just be you.

772
00:50:27,299 --> 00:50:29,217
<i>- Be me?
- Yeah.</i>

773
00:50:29,301 --> 00:50:31,511
Okay. That's easy.

774
00:50:37,559 --> 00:50:41,104
- You live near here?
- Yeah.

775
00:50:43,565 --> 00:50:47,152
- Okay.
- Okay, what?

776
00:50:48,695 --> 00:50:51,489
<i>- Okay, I'll come over.
- You'll come over?</i>

777
00:50:52,574 --> 00:50:55,160
You'll come over.

778
00:50:55,243 --> 00:50:57,245
Great. My mom's not home.

779
00:50:57,329 --> 00:51:00,123
<i>- You live with your mom?
- Yeah.</i>

780
00:51:00,165 --> 00:51:02,459
But she's out playing Mahjong.

781
00:51:05,378 --> 00:51:07,589
Okay.

782
00:51:14,137 --> 00:51:16,806
How come you only have records,
no CDs?

783
00:51:16,890 --> 00:51:20,769
<i>Uh, I've got some CDs,
but I, uh, prefer records.</i>

784
00:51:20,852 --> 00:51:24,356
<i>- Why?
- Well, I, uh...</i>

785
00:51:24,439 --> 00:51:27,108
<i>Do you really want me to tell you?</i>

786
00:51:27,192 --> 00:51:30,612
Hmm. You're right.

787
00:51:39,955 --> 00:51:43,542
- You gotta kick me out.
- What?

788
00:51:43,583 --> 00:51:48,088
I really wanna have sex with you. I really do.
But first, I need you to kick me out.

789
00:51:50,924 --> 00:51:53,468
<i>- You're kidding, right?
- No, I'm not. I'm not kidding.</i>

790
00:51:53,552 --> 00:51:57,389
Kick me out and I'll go home.
And then call me.

791
00:51:59,015 --> 00:52:00,976
What kind of screwed-up
childhood did you have?

792
00:52:01,017 --> 00:52:03,687
Just kick me out
and don't care about me...

793
00:52:03,728 --> 00:52:05,689
and we'll call it a day, you know?

794
00:52:05,730 --> 00:52:10,151
- And then call me another day and we'll...
- I'm not gonna kick you out.

795
00:52:13,446 --> 00:52:16,616
Okay, by not kicking me out,
you're basically asking me to leave.

796
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:19,536
I don't want you to leave.

797
00:52:19,578 --> 00:52:22,455
I'm gonna leave.

798
00:52:40,307 --> 00:52:43,602
- Who was that?
- Myra, please.

799
00:52:43,685 --> 00:52:46,229
Who?

800
00:52:46,313 --> 00:52:48,982
Good night, Myra.

801
00:52:58,241 --> 00:53:01,036
I'm sorry.

802
00:53:20,096 --> 00:53:23,517
- Hi.
- Hey. Did you sleep good?

803
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:27,437
- You snore.
- I know. I'm sorry.

804
00:53:27,521 --> 00:53:30,023
<i>Is someone here?</i>

805
00:53:30,106 --> 00:53:33,443
<i>Oh. James, who's this?</i>

806
00:53:33,527 --> 00:53:35,445
I'm James's friend, Beth.

807
00:53:35,529 --> 00:53:39,366
Oh. A girl. How sweet.

808
00:53:39,449 --> 00:53:41,701
- Dear, would you sit down there?
- Sure.

809
00:53:41,785 --> 00:53:44,329
- We'll have a cup of tea.
- Okay.

810
00:53:44,412 --> 00:53:47,624
- You don't need to do that, Ma.
- Oh, I wanna do it. No trouble at all.

811
00:53:47,707 --> 00:53:49,835
- I'd prefer if you didn't do that, Ma.
- Yes.

812
00:53:49,918 --> 00:53:53,004
l- I'd like to know
your friend a little bit.

813
00:53:53,088 --> 00:53:57,509
<i>Tell me, uh, how long
have you known James?</i>

814
00:53:57,592 --> 00:54:01,346
- We just met.
- Oh.

815
00:54:01,429 --> 00:54:03,765
- You like?
- Ma!

816
00:54:05,642 --> 00:54:08,937
James is a lovely boy.

817
00:54:09,020 --> 00:54:11,565
With my mom, both people
and food are lovely.

818
00:54:11,648 --> 00:54:15,277
- The other day she asked me
if I wanted a lovely brisket.

819
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:17,320
All right, you know what, Ma,
we're gonna go.

820
00:54:17,362 --> 00:54:19,322
- I understand.
- Yeah.

821
00:54:19,364 --> 00:54:23,785
- Why don't you come with us?
- Well, I'd like to, but James wants me to, uh, leave him alone.

822
00:54:23,869 --> 00:54:27,914
<i>- That I do.
- Yes, well, that's the way it is.</i>

823
00:54:27,998 --> 00:54:30,208
<i>- Okay, let's go. Bye, Ma.
- It was nice to meet you.</i>

824
00:54:30,292 --> 00:54:33,170
Bye-bye, dear.
Nice to meet you, sweetheart.

825
00:54:36,381 --> 00:54:38,466
Morning, Henry.

826
00:54:38,550 --> 00:54:40,719
Why do you live with your mother?

827
00:54:40,802 --> 00:54:44,431
Well, you know,
I figure she's just lonely and...

828
00:54:44,472 --> 00:54:46,641
she needs someone
to keep her company and...

829
00:54:46,683 --> 00:54:49,352
I really don't know why to be honest,
I just, uh...

830
00:54:49,436 --> 00:54:52,939
It's comfortable and I don't know
what she'd do if I ever moved out.

831
00:54:55,692 --> 00:54:58,528
- I want coffee.
- I could use some coffee too.

832
00:54:58,570 --> 00:55:02,616
<i>I'm just gonna go home
and get some Starbucks on the way.</i>

833
00:55:02,657 --> 00:55:04,826
<i>You sure?</i>

834
00:55:04,910 --> 00:55:08,997
<i>- Uh, I'll-I'll call you.
- Okay.</i>

835
00:55:10,248 --> 00:55:12,250
Okay.

836
00:55:18,465 --> 00:55:20,383
- James?
- Yeah.

837
00:55:20,467 --> 00:55:22,385
- Forget something?
- No.

838
00:55:22,469 --> 00:55:25,305
- Where's the girl?
- She had to go home.

839
00:55:25,388 --> 00:55:28,058
<i>- Neil called from the theater.
- Well, what did he want?</i>

840
00:55:28,141 --> 00:55:32,020
- He didn't say.
- Hey, Ma, did you know that they're remaking Marty?

841
00:55:32,103 --> 00:55:36,191
<i>- What do you mean, remaking?
- New actors, same movie.</i>

842
00:55:36,274 --> 00:55:38,527
They're remaking Marty.
They're redoing the movie.

843
00:55:38,610 --> 00:55:41,613
<i>- That's wonderful.
- No, it's not wonderful.</i>

844
00:55:41,696 --> 00:55:43,657
<i>It's horrible.</i>

845
00:55:43,657 --> 00:55:46,284
I mean, why would you remake Marty?
It's a perfect movie.

846
00:55:46,368 --> 00:55:51,081
And even worse than that, I can't get an audition.
The casting director won't see me.

847
00:55:51,164 --> 00:55:55,085
Why don't you go and tell that casting
director that you wanna be in the movie?

848
00:55:55,168 --> 00:55:57,796
<i>- 'Cause it doesn't work that way.
- Why not?</i>

849
00:56:00,465 --> 00:56:02,384
You're right. Why not?

850
00:56:02,467 --> 00:56:04,553
Put on something nice.

851
00:56:04,636 --> 00:56:07,180
Why don't you just tell me
to put on the blue suit?

852
00:56:07,264 --> 00:56:10,016
The blue suit.
What blue suit?

853
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:12,310
It was a joke, like in Marty...

854
00:56:12,394 --> 00:56:15,981
when she tells him to put on the blue suit
and go to the Stardust Ballroom.

855
00:56:16,022 --> 00:56:18,441
<i>- Do you have a blue suit?
- I do.</i>

856
00:56:18,483 --> 00:56:22,654
- Wear it.
- All right. I will, Ma.

857
00:56:27,242 --> 00:56:29,703
I'm, uh, here to audition for, uh, Marty.

858
00:56:29,786 --> 00:56:31,913
Oh, we're actually just
seeing, uh, Claras today.

859
00:56:31,997 --> 00:56:34,541
I know. He told me that.
But I think you should see me for Marty.

860
00:56:34,624 --> 00:56:36,543
I'm perfect.
It's my favorite all-time movie, man.

861
00:56:36,626 --> 00:56:39,754
<i>- You gotta let me audition.
- Not now, James.</i>

862
00:56:39,838 --> 00:56:45,177
Well, if you don't let me audition,
I'm gonna stay here all day.

863
00:56:45,218 --> 00:56:48,305
- Ooh.
- Not gonna leave.

864
00:56:48,388 --> 00:56:51,224
<i>- Y- You don't wanna do that.
- Oh, yes, I do.</i>

865
00:56:51,308 --> 00:56:53,602
- Oh, you shouldn't do that.
- I will.

866
00:56:53,643 --> 00:56:56,438
Okay. Okay, fine.

867
00:56:57,564 --> 00:57:00,525
- Glenn, who's my next Clara?
- She is.

868
00:57:00,609 --> 00:57:02,527
Okay.

869
00:57:02,611 --> 00:57:04,529
Come on in.

870
00:57:04,613 --> 00:57:06,615
<i>- I'll be right here.
- Yeah.</i>

871
00:57:07,824 --> 00:57:12,829
Sorry to freak you guys out,
but, uh, l-I have to do this.

872
00:57:12,913 --> 00:57:14,831
<i>Why are you doing this?</i>

873
00:57:14,915 --> 00:57:19,711
Well, uh, last night I had sex
for the first time in five years...

874
00:57:19,794 --> 00:57:22,339
and I'm feeling pretty invincible.

875
00:57:26,343 --> 00:57:31,097
I know, it's a little bit too much
information, but... I'm sorry.

876
00:57:51,576 --> 00:57:53,537
Come on, James.
It's been cast.

877
00:57:54,621 --> 00:57:56,581
- Burl...
- It's cast. It's cast.

878
00:57:56,665 --> 00:58:00,418
- See me.
- It's cast. The role has been cast.

879
00:58:00,502 --> 00:58:03,255
- Who's playing Marty?
- Aaron Carter.

880
00:58:03,296 --> 00:58:06,716
- Who is Aaron Carter?
- If you were a teenage girl, you'd know.

881
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:10,220
<i>- They're making Marty for teenage girls?
- Mmm.</i>

882
00:58:10,303 --> 00:58:12,722
- Who's playing the mother?
- Gina Gershon.

883
00:58:12,764 --> 00:58:15,767
- Marty's mom is hot?
- She is now.

884
00:58:15,851 --> 00:58:18,019
<i>- Have you ever seen Marty?
- Of course I've seen Marty.</i>

885
00:58:18,103 --> 00:58:21,356
- You've never seen Marty.
- I have seen Marty.

886
00:58:21,398 --> 00:58:23,400
<i>Who starred in Marty?</i>

887
00:58:24,693 --> 00:58:26,820
Ernest Borgnine won an Academy Award.
Who wrote it?

888
00:58:26,903 --> 00:58:29,114
- Uh...
- Paddy Chayefsky.

889
00:58:29,197 --> 00:58:31,575
Gosh.

890
00:58:32,576 --> 00:58:35,036
<i>Did you hear, uh,
they're remaking Marty?</i>

891
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:37,706
- Yeah. Oh, yeah, I heard.
- You know who's playing Marty?

892
00:58:37,789 --> 00:58:39,708
- Who?
- Aaron Carter.

893
00:58:39,791 --> 00:58:42,836
- The old Wonder Woman?
- That's Linda Carter.

894
00:58:42,919 --> 00:58:45,005
- Oh, right.
- No, Aaron Carter.

895
00:58:45,088 --> 00:58:47,507
Right, uh, pop star.
I think my daughter likes him.

896
00:58:47,591 --> 00:58:50,010
<i>Well, she's gonna love
the new Marty, okay?</i>

897
00:58:50,093 --> 00:58:52,345
<i>I'll let her know.</i>

898
00:58:52,429 --> 00:58:54,514
James, I gotta fire you.

899
00:58:56,183 --> 00:58:59,102
It's nothing personal.
It's just you've been around here too long.

900
00:58:59,186 --> 00:59:03,023
And I got some great people in the touring
company I gotta move up or I'm gonna lose 'em.

901
00:59:03,106 --> 00:59:05,025
But it's nothing personal.

902
00:59:05,108 --> 00:59:08,445
<i>Listen to me, I'm telling you, it's not personal.
You should give L.A. another shot.</i>

903
00:59:08,486 --> 00:59:10,655
Go on out there.
You're not getting any younger.

904
00:59:10,697 --> 00:59:13,283
I'm not going to L.A.
I'm staying here in Chicago.

905
00:59:13,366 --> 00:59:17,496
<i>Well, that's your business,
but you can't stay here. I'm sorry.</i>

906
00:59:19,539 --> 00:59:21,750
You're not sorry.

907
00:59:23,460 --> 00:59:25,504
You're right. I'm not.

908
00:59:31,051 --> 00:59:33,011
- Hi, sweetie.
- Hi, Ma.

909
00:59:33,094 --> 00:59:37,098
- Where you going with flowers?
- Uh, to see a girl about a horse.

910
00:59:37,182 --> 00:59:39,184
Oh, what do you mean?

911
00:59:39,226 --> 00:59:42,062
Uh, it's what Grandpa used to say,
to see a man about a horse.

912
00:59:42,145 --> 00:59:44,064
Uh-huh. And?

913
00:59:44,147 --> 00:59:47,943
So I'm gonna see a girl about a horse.
I was just having... Never mind.

914
00:59:48,026 --> 00:59:51,404
- Well, what are you doing with flowers?
- I'm goin' to see a girl.

915
00:59:51,488 --> 00:59:55,075
- Well, don't do anything I would do.
- Wouldn't do.

916
00:59:55,158 --> 00:59:58,078
That's too negative.

917
00:59:59,162 --> 01:00:01,081
- Bye, Ma.
- Bye, sweetie.

918
01:00:01,164 --> 01:00:03,333
- I love you.
- Love you.

919
01:00:17,222 --> 01:00:20,058
Um, Clark, north of Addison.

920
01:00:20,100 --> 01:00:23,937
Can do.
You meeting a girl?

921
01:00:23,979 --> 01:00:29,150
- What makes you say that?
- The flowers. You going on a date?

922
01:00:29,234 --> 01:00:32,946
Um... no, I'm just meeting a girl.

923
01:00:33,029 --> 01:00:35,031
Uh, I'm not...
No date. It's not a date.

924
01:00:35,115 --> 01:00:39,578
Don't do it, okay? Don't do it.

925
01:00:39,661 --> 01:00:42,247
- What are you talking about, don't do it?
- Don't do it.

926
01:00:42,330 --> 01:00:46,042
l... I can turn the meter off
right now and take you home.

927
01:00:46,126 --> 01:00:48,545
I won't charge you a penny.

928
01:00:48,628 --> 01:00:52,090
Well, why do you say that?

929
01:00:52,174 --> 01:00:54,467
Because I can tell these...
I know these things.

930
01:00:54,509 --> 01:00:57,679
That girl gonna break your heart, man.
I know these things.

931
01:00:57,762 --> 01:01:00,599
- You know she's gonna break my heart?
- I know she's gonna break your heart.

932
01:01:00,682 --> 01:01:03,685
Oh, I think it'll be fine.
l- l-I don't think any problem.

933
01:01:03,768 --> 01:01:06,730
I'm just going over to see a girl.
Nothing more than that.

934
01:01:10,192 --> 01:01:12,944
Not too late.
I can still take you home.

935
01:01:12,986 --> 01:01:14,446
No.

936
01:01:14,529 --> 01:01:17,032
<i>Should I wait?
Maybe I'll wait.</i>

937
01:01:17,115 --> 01:01:19,576
No. Don't wait.

938
01:01:19,618 --> 01:01:22,454
I tried.

939
01:01:28,126 --> 01:01:30,962
- Who is it?
- James.

940
01:01:31,046 --> 01:01:34,132
- James who?
- James Aaron.

941
01:01:34,216 --> 01:01:36,510
<i>I don't know any James.</i>

942
01:01:36,551 --> 01:01:39,304
Then why did you ask James who?

943
01:01:39,387 --> 01:01:41,389
<i>Good night.</i>

944
01:01:46,603 --> 01:01:50,273
<i>- Hello?
- Beth, it's James.</i>

945
01:01:51,900 --> 01:01:53,902
I'll be right down.

946
01:02:10,836 --> 01:02:14,089
- Hi.
- Thanks. Hey.

947
01:02:14,172 --> 01:02:17,676
- Why are you here?
- Just wanted to see you.

948
01:02:17,759 --> 01:02:23,014
Well, I don't want flowers. I don't want
someone to bring me flowers.

949
01:02:23,056 --> 01:02:26,142
- So I won't bring you flowers anymore.
- No.

950
01:02:26,226 --> 01:02:31,690
There's no anymore. There's
not gonna be an anymore, James. It's...

951
01:02:33,024 --> 01:02:35,277
What about wanting somebody
to eat cheese with?

952
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:37,821
I just... I've never been with a fat guy.

953
01:02:39,155 --> 01:02:42,159
<i>I mean, it was fun.</i>

954
01:02:42,242 --> 01:02:46,163
It just... was just a thing, you know.

955
01:02:47,164 --> 01:02:49,416
<i>Oh.</i>

956
01:02:49,457 --> 01:02:51,585
Don't look at me so sad.

957
01:02:51,668 --> 01:02:55,422
<i>You're gonna be fine.
You're gonna be okay.</i>

958
01:02:57,632 --> 01:02:59,968
<i>Thanks for the flowers.</i>

959
01:03:14,107 --> 01:03:16,026
<i>Uh, thank you.</i>

960
01:03:16,109 --> 01:03:18,612
- Hello, James.
- Hello, Claude.

961
01:03:18,695 --> 01:03:21,531
- I spoke to the producers tonight.
- Producers?

962
01:03:21,615 --> 01:03:23,783
And they said that there's some parts
that are still open.

963
01:03:23,867 --> 01:03:27,204
- What parts, what producers?
- The producers of Marty.

964
01:03:27,287 --> 01:03:31,208
I saw them earlier this evening at Gamekeepers.
I told them I'm Claude Clochet...

965
01:03:31,249 --> 01:03:34,461
and I've won three Joseph Jefferson Awards
for excellence in the theater arts.

966
01:03:34,544 --> 01:03:37,005
<i>I told them I didn't have much time
to do their film...</i>

967
01:03:37,088 --> 01:03:40,926
<i>as I'm currently in rehearsals for
Creme Brulee, a new work by Vic Meyerson.</i>

968
01:03:41,009 --> 01:03:45,013
<i>I hadn't heard of Vic either
until last year when we met at a party...</i>

969
01:03:45,096 --> 01:03:48,683
and he came up to me and he said,
"You're Claude Clochet, are you not?"

970
01:03:48,767 --> 01:03:51,436
And I said,
"I am indeed Claude Clochet."

971
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:55,732
And he said, "Claude Clochet, I believe
that you are an instrument of emotions."

972
01:03:55,815 --> 01:03:58,693
And I said, "Huh.
That's funny and ironic...

973
01:03:58,777 --> 01:04:01,363
because I often think of myself
as an instrument of emotion."

974
01:04:01,446 --> 01:04:04,658
And then I thought to myself
if, as an instrument of emotion...

975
01:04:04,699 --> 01:04:07,702
I happen to win three
Joseph Jefferson Awards, well, then so be it.

976
01:04:07,786 --> 01:04:11,039
At that time I'd only won two,
but I knew a third was soon to come.

977
01:04:11,122 --> 01:04:13,500
I didn't feel it. I knew it.

978
01:04:13,583 --> 01:04:17,379
And, as a matter of fact, I told this very story
as part of my acceptance speech.

979
01:04:19,130 --> 01:04:21,091
Great.

980
01:04:21,174 --> 01:04:23,593
There's still some parts open.
I thought you might like to know.

981
01:04:23,677 --> 01:04:25,804
And maybe you can have Herb call for you.

982
01:04:25,887 --> 01:04:27,931
I gotta go.

983
01:04:35,105 --> 01:04:37,482
- You're all out.
- They're gonna deliver tomorrow.

984
01:04:37,566 --> 01:04:42,153
- I can't believe you're all out.
- Well, I got some in back, but they're way past their freshness date.

985
01:04:42,237 --> 01:04:45,657
- How far past?
- I don't know. I just know it's not fresh.

986
01:04:45,657 --> 01:04:48,285
- Get 'em.
- You don't want those.

987
01:04:48,368 --> 01:04:51,037
Please, get 'em, Dick.

988
01:04:52,330 --> 01:04:54,457
Oh.

989
01:05:19,691 --> 01:05:23,361
- Where's the guy?
- I don't know. He went in the back.

990
01:05:23,445 --> 01:05:25,447
That's weird.

991
01:05:31,828 --> 01:05:33,830
I've never seen this before.

992
01:05:34,998 --> 01:05:37,918
We ought to just walk out of here,
teach him a lesson.

993
01:05:39,586 --> 01:05:41,713
It's outrageous.

994
01:05:46,176 --> 01:05:48,637
- Where were you?
- I had something to take care of.

995
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:51,556
- I got stuff to do too, you know.
- I'm sorry.

996
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:56,019
- If you cared, you'd be out here.
- I got diarrhea, okay? You happy?

997
01:05:56,102 --> 01:06:00,440
Yeah, actually I am happy.
Dick like you deserves diarrhea.

998
01:06:01,816 --> 01:06:05,320
<i>Wow. Do you believe that guy?</i>

999
01:06:05,403 --> 01:06:09,199
- Diarrhea?
- It's all I could think of.

1000
01:06:09,282 --> 01:06:14,287
- Here, I found some.
- Oh, man. Thank you.

1001
01:06:14,371 --> 01:06:18,875
- Thank you.
- Don't. No, don't. They're old.

1002
01:06:18,959 --> 01:06:23,088
I'm not gonna charge you for 'em.
Here. Take 'em.

1003
01:06:23,171 --> 01:06:25,423
<i>- Milk's on me.
- Wow. Thank you.</i>

1004
01:06:25,465 --> 01:06:28,927
Uh, it's none of my business...

1005
01:06:29,010 --> 01:06:31,137
but I think you got a problem.

1006
01:06:31,221 --> 01:06:33,807
Take it for what it's worth.

1007
01:06:33,890 --> 01:06:36,017
Thanks.

1008
01:08:05,857 --> 01:08:09,027
<i>How did things go with that girl?
- I'd rather not talk about it.</i>

1009
01:08:09,110 --> 01:08:11,238
<i>Why not?</i>

1010
01:08:11,321 --> 01:08:14,658
Because you're my mom.
You're gonna have an opinion.

1011
01:08:14,699 --> 01:08:17,577
<i>- I will not.
- Oh, yes, you will.</i>

1012
01:08:17,619 --> 01:08:21,456
No. There's nothing that
you can say that will get me.

1013
01:08:21,498 --> 01:08:23,458
- Nothing?
- Nothing.

1014
01:08:23,500 --> 01:08:25,877
All right. Um...

1015
01:08:25,961 --> 01:08:30,298
let's see, the other night, uh,
when you were out playing Mahjong...

1016
01:08:30,340 --> 01:08:33,176
<i>I, um...</i>

1017
01:08:33,218 --> 01:08:36,471
I had sex for the first time
in five years.

1018
01:08:36,555 --> 01:08:39,683
- Uh, and...
- And?

1019
01:08:39,766 --> 01:08:42,727
Yes, and-and, uh, she only did it...

1020
01:08:42,811 --> 01:08:45,897
for her own little game,
or I don't even know why...

1021
01:08:45,939 --> 01:08:48,233
she felt bad for me,
I'm not sure.

1022
01:08:48,316 --> 01:08:53,029
But, uh, it wasn't about anything,
and she doesn't really dig me.

1023
01:08:53,113 --> 01:08:55,574
- And...
- And?

1024
01:08:55,615 --> 01:08:59,035
I'm, uh, moving out.

1025
01:09:01,037 --> 01:09:06,001
Jamesy, l-l-I do think
you should move out.

1026
01:09:06,042 --> 01:09:07,836
You need to live your own life.

1027
01:09:07,878 --> 01:09:13,383
All right. I'm so... Wow.
I'm shocked that you'd even say that.

1028
01:09:13,466 --> 01:09:15,677
<i>Okay, well.</i>

1029
01:09:15,760 --> 01:09:18,054
So tomorrow I'm gonna
go look for an-an apartment.

1030
01:09:18,138 --> 01:09:20,056
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1031
01:09:20,098 --> 01:09:22,893
That's good. I think I'll look for one too.
I hate it here.

1032
01:09:22,976 --> 01:09:25,145
I thought I was gonna be
the one to move out.

1033
01:09:25,228 --> 01:09:27,355
Well, couldn't we both move out?

1034
01:09:27,439 --> 01:09:29,357
- Let's both move out.
- Get our own...

1035
01:09:29,441 --> 01:09:31,860
- We'll help each other look for apartments.
- We'll get our own places.

1036
01:09:31,943 --> 01:09:33,862
- Yes.
- It'll be no trouble.

1037
01:09:33,945 --> 01:09:35,947
- And I'll have sex.
- All you want.

1038
01:09:37,657 --> 01:09:40,368
<i>I have lived a life of unhealthy choices.</i>

1039
01:09:40,452 --> 01:09:42,370
Elaborate.

1040
01:09:42,454 --> 01:09:44,998
I'm an actor. How healthy is that?
As... Wait, hold on.

1041
01:09:45,081 --> 01:09:48,543
I'm not even an actor, okay?
I got fired from Second City.

1042
01:09:48,627 --> 01:09:52,297
<i>- Being an actor isn't, in itself, unhealthy.
- Okay.</i>

1043
01:09:52,297 --> 01:09:56,259
I stand up on stage and I say,
"Hey, everybody, look at me. Look at me.

1044
01:09:56,343 --> 01:09:59,387
"I'm worthy and good.
Cheer me and applaud.

1045
01:09:59,471 --> 01:10:01,723
Hooray for me, the actor."

1046
01:10:01,765 --> 01:10:05,268
<i>- Okay, I'll give you that one.
- Okay. Secondly.</i>

1047
01:10:05,352 --> 01:10:08,939
I like 'em young and insane.
I do. Okay?

1048
01:10:09,022 --> 01:10:12,692
And someday I'd like to be married
and have kids, and here I am some fat-ass...

1049
01:10:12,776 --> 01:10:15,320
By the way, that's the third thing.
I'm fat-assed.

1050
01:10:15,403 --> 01:10:17,989
Look, I am married
to an old insane woman...

1051
01:10:18,073 --> 01:10:21,535
who, by the way, when we met,
was young and insane.

1052
01:10:21,618 --> 01:10:25,539
It's not so much who you're attracted to,
but you do need to lead a healthier life.

1053
01:10:27,082 --> 01:10:30,585
You know what, I've decided from now on
I want you to refer to me as "Kitten."

1054
01:10:31,670 --> 01:10:34,714
You seem real comfortable
with yourself, but you're not.

1055
01:10:34,798 --> 01:10:38,760
<i>- The magic of self-loathing.
- I know it well.</i>

1056
01:10:38,802 --> 01:10:42,138
- Hello, Luca. Hello, James.
- Hello, ladies.

1057
01:10:42,180 --> 01:10:44,599
- We're ready, Luca.
- Wonderful. So am I.

1058
01:10:44,641 --> 01:10:47,686
So am I.
I think we should play canasta.

1059
01:10:47,769 --> 01:10:50,438
As long as we have blackjack,
I don't care what else we use.

1060
01:10:50,522 --> 01:10:52,774
That's okay too.
That's okay too.

1061
01:10:52,858 --> 01:10:55,944
- Casino night.
- Oh. Sounds like fun.

1062
01:10:56,027 --> 01:10:58,363
Why don't you come?
We don't see you often.

1063
01:10:58,446 --> 01:11:02,742
<i>Oh, that's so nice of you, Mrs. Schwartz.
Uh, maybe I will. I'll consider it.</i>

1064
01:11:02,826 --> 01:11:05,579
Okay. Nice to see you, ladies.

1065
01:11:05,662 --> 01:11:07,581
Bye, ladies.

1066
01:11:07,664 --> 01:11:10,959
I think she's got a thing for you,
that Mrs. Schwartz.

1067
01:11:11,001 --> 01:11:13,378
Yeah, that's just what I want now
is elderly and insane.

1068
01:11:13,461 --> 01:11:15,463
I'm just saying
it's there if you want it.

1069
01:11:15,547 --> 01:11:17,632
It's there if I want it.

1070
01:11:19,217 --> 01:11:23,013
Philip, don't forget,
flyer for the art fair, everybody.

1071
01:11:25,140 --> 01:11:28,018
- Hi.
- Hi.

1072
01:11:28,059 --> 01:11:32,147
- I'm here to pick up Penelope.
- Oh, you've got your official note.

1073
01:11:32,230 --> 01:11:34,232
- Mm-hmm.
- All right, sure.

1074
01:11:34,316 --> 01:11:38,778
Penelope, your uncle James
is here for you, hon. How are ya?

1075
01:11:38,778 --> 01:11:41,573
I'm great.
Much better than the last time. Uh...

1076
01:11:41,615 --> 01:11:44,034
<i>- Oh, good. So you're good.
- I'm, uh... Yeah, I'm young and handsome.</i>

1077
01:11:44,117 --> 01:11:46,620
Yes, you are.

1078
01:11:46,703 --> 01:11:48,788
That's right.
You're, uh, a chubby chaser.

1079
01:11:48,872 --> 01:11:51,625
<i>Hi, uncle James.</i>

1080
01:11:51,708 --> 01:11:53,919
<i>- Hi, sweetie.
- Where's daddy?</i>

1081
01:11:54,002 --> 01:11:58,173
<i>- He had to work late, so I thought I'd come and get you and we'd have fun.
- Okay.</i>

1082
01:11:58,256 --> 01:12:00,842
Honey, where's your lunch box?
You better go fetch that, right?

1083
01:12:00,926 --> 01:12:02,886
- Oh.
- You don't wanna leave that here.

1084
01:12:02,928 --> 01:12:04,888
Chubby chaser?
I'm a chubby chaser?

1085
01:12:04,930 --> 01:12:08,225
Yeah. You know, a chubby chaser.

1086
01:12:08,308 --> 01:12:10,936
<i>- Who said that to you?
- That guidance lady.</i>

1087
01:12:10,977 --> 01:12:12,979
The one you, uh, sent me to.

1088
01:12:13,063 --> 01:12:15,273
<i>- Guidance lady?
- Yeah, you...</i>

1089
01:12:15,357 --> 01:12:18,235
She has... She does have a name.
Oh, Ms. Clark.

1090
01:12:18,318 --> 01:12:20,237
Ms. Clark.
The guidance lady, yeah.

1091
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:23,573
- I think it's Mr. Faye is why it happened, why...
- Mr. Faye?

1092
01:12:23,657 --> 01:12:26,493
Yeah. He was a teacher that worked here
that was a little overweight...

1093
01:12:26,576 --> 01:12:29,246
and he didn't have any friends,
and I asked him to dinner.

1094
01:12:29,329 --> 01:12:32,415
He turned me down and then he started
telling everybody I had the hots for him, so...

1095
01:12:32,457 --> 01:12:35,669
- Wow.
- That's where it started. I'm not chasing all the chubbies.

1096
01:12:35,752 --> 01:12:39,089
I would never deliberately
run after chubby men.

1097
01:12:39,130 --> 01:12:41,091
Not that there's anything
wrong with chubby men.

1098
01:12:41,132 --> 01:12:44,594
You know what I mean?
Fat guys can be a lot of fun. Not fat guys.

1099
01:12:44,678 --> 01:12:47,138
<i>I'm saying guys that eat a lot more
than other people...</i>

1100
01:12:47,138 --> 01:12:49,224
and some of the weight
stays on their body inappropriately.

1101
01:12:49,307 --> 01:12:52,143
- Mm-hmm.
- It's good to see you here.

1102
01:12:52,185 --> 01:12:56,106
I've never seen you pick up Penelope before.
I'm sorry. I get on a rampage sometimes.

1103
01:12:56,189 --> 01:12:59,025
Well, I thought it'd be fun and, uh...

1104
01:12:59,067 --> 01:13:01,319
I love hanging out with her,
and I get to say hi to you.

1105
01:13:03,697 --> 01:13:05,866
That's very nice.

1106
01:13:05,949 --> 01:13:08,493
<i>I didn't bring my lunch box today.
It was pizza day.</i>

1107
01:13:08,577 --> 01:13:11,705
No, it's not pizza day.
I think you did bring your lunch box.

1108
01:13:11,788 --> 01:13:13,707
It was pizza day.

1109
01:13:13,790 --> 01:13:17,752
<i>I thought you brought it.
I think I made just an honest mistake.</i>

1110
01:13:17,836 --> 01:13:19,921
<i>- Is what happened.
- Okay, um...</i>

1111
01:13:20,005 --> 01:13:23,592
- I just thought she could make sure that she didn't bring it.
- Sure.

1112
01:13:25,552 --> 01:13:27,345
Yeah.

1113
01:13:27,387 --> 01:13:31,099
- Well, nice, uh, seeing you again.
- Mm-hmm. Nice seeing you too.

1114
01:13:31,183 --> 01:13:34,644
- Should I take a flyer? Bring a flyer?
- Yeah, you better or I'll chase you out of here.

1115
01:13:34,686 --> 01:13:36,730
All right, uh, bye.

1116
01:13:36,813 --> 01:13:38,231
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

1117
01:13:38,273 --> 01:13:40,275
- Come on, sweetie.
- Bye, cutie.

1118
01:13:52,662 --> 01:13:56,041
- You're gonna die without a son.
- So I'll die without a son.

1119
01:13:56,124 --> 01:13:58,418
Put on your blue suit, huh?

1120
01:13:58,502 --> 01:14:02,672
Blue suit, gray suit.
I'm still a fat man. A fat, ugly man.

1121
01:14:02,756 --> 01:14:05,967
- You no ugly.
- I'm ugly! I'm ugly! I'm ugly!

1122
01:14:06,051 --> 01:14:09,304
- Marty.
- Leave me alone, Ma.

1123
01:14:14,935 --> 01:14:18,271
- It was pretty good.
- You know, I thought so too.

1124
01:14:21,191 --> 01:14:23,109
What, you stole 3-D glasses?

1125
01:14:23,193 --> 01:14:25,695
I didn't know they weren't for...
What do you wanna do?

1126
01:14:25,779 --> 01:14:28,365
Um, I don't know.
What do you wanna do?

1127
01:14:28,448 --> 01:14:31,243
Want to get something to eat?

1128
01:14:31,326 --> 01:14:34,329
You know what, I wanna get something to eat,
but I'm not gonna get something to eat.

1129
01:14:34,412 --> 01:14:38,375
<i>l... I'm not hungry and so, if I'm not hungry
I'm not gonna eat. No more bonus eating.</i>

1130
01:14:38,458 --> 01:14:41,711
- Good for you.
- Thank you. Thank you.

1131
01:14:44,422 --> 01:14:48,218
- Wanna watch me eat?
- What do you mean, come watch you eat?

1132
01:14:48,260 --> 01:14:50,512
<i>Why would I wanna come watch you eat?
You know what?</i>

1133
01:14:50,595 --> 01:14:52,597
I'm gonna go see my mom.
I haven't seen her for a while.

1134
01:14:52,681 --> 01:14:54,724
- How's she doing?
- She's doing great.

1135
01:14:54,808 --> 01:14:58,353
- I thought she'd freak out after I moved out, but you know what? She's digging it.
- Good for her.

1136
01:14:58,436 --> 01:15:00,397
Maybe she'll come watch you eat.

1137
01:15:00,480 --> 01:15:04,401
- Hey, tell her I said hi.
- I'll tell her you said hi.

1138
01:15:25,714 --> 01:15:28,508
So what are you doing tonight?

1139
01:15:28,592 --> 01:15:32,095
- Ah, gonna stay home.
- And do what?

1140
01:15:32,179 --> 01:15:35,265
- I don't know, watch TV, watch Jackie Gleason.
- Oh, boy, that's a thrill.

1141
01:15:35,348 --> 01:15:39,019
- Jackie Gleason.
- Again with the Jackie Gleason.
