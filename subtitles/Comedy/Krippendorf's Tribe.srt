You want Dr. Leakey back.

Dad, it's Mr. Schramm

He said he's dead. What
do you mean, dead...

Mickey, put on this shirt.

76

Oh.

78

This smells too.
Only it smells like you.

00:06:01,428 --> 00:06:03,495
Hmm.

I'm sorry. I rang the doorbell a bunch

- Excuse me.

May I say something? What?

91
00:06:44,438 --> 00:06:46,872
You're the reason
I became an anthropologist.

92
00:06:46,874 --> 00:06:50,542
<i>You</i> are an anthropologist?
Yeah, I'm on the faculty now.

93

We are colleagues.
Isn't that amazing?

94
00:06:52,713 --> 00:06:54,179
Thrilling. I know.

95
00:06:54,181 --> 00:06:56,782
Can I ask you a question?
Of course.

96
00:06:56,784 --> 00:07:00,552
What are you doing here? Shouldn't the
What are<i> you</i> doing here?

One of the greatest anthropological
minds of our time.

98

A mind that has now discovered a
lost civilization that no one...

99
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:10,028
what are you doing here?
That's what I think.

100
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:12,798
Because you should be up there!

101
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,933
Yeah. Up there...

102

that are already up there.

Well, there doesn't
seem to be any fax.

123

I'm not finding any... oh!

124
00:08:28,642 --> 00:08:31,543

on the lost tribe
that you found.

128
00:08:43,156 --> 00:08:46,725
Well, if I told you I lost them
again, could I get an extension?

129
00:08:46,727 --> 00:08:48,260
Oh, Professor.

130
00:08:48,262 --> 00:08:50,262

Hoo-ha, hoo-ha... what
are you doing up there?

134
00:09:02,576 --> 00:09:04,843
I'm giving Dr. Leakey
a gotonta tree burial.

135
00:09:04,845 --> 00:09:07,012
<i>It's my project</i>

Mickey, stop! Get back here!

141
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:24,930
Oh, for crying out loud, Mickey!
I think I'll be going now.

142
00:09:24,932 --> 00:09:28,600
- Do you hear me?
- So sorry to interrupt, but the bus is here.

143

All right, all right. I wanted
a dog, you stupid hamster!

144
00:09:31,972 --> 00:09:34,306
Mickey, put the rake down
and get on the bus.

145
00:09:34,308 --> 00:09:37,742
You can finish killing your pet
when you get home.

146
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:40,879
Put the rake down. There we go.
Give me the camera!

<i>What is wrong with you?</i>

149
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:47,218
So what can I do to help you?
Not a thing.

150
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:50,255
I'm a whiz with data entry.
Under control.

151
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:52,257
Proofreading? Nope, nope, nope.

152
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:55,260
Okay, should you need anything at all,
look, I wrote down my home number,

153
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:57,228
and that's my fax number,
and that's my cel phone.

154
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:59,230
You're too kind.

155
00:09:59,232 --> 00:10:02,267
Please. I feel we share a common
goal with this. Thank you.

156
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:04,669
Don't mention it.

157
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:07,205
Beeper! Thank... you.

158
00:10:07,207 --> 00:10:09,674
Okay.

159
00:10:09,676 --> 00:10:11,843
Thank you! Okay.

160
00:10:35,902 --> 00:10:38,837
<i>Mmm, good? Mmm, good.</i>

161
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:42,841
<i>No, no, that's enough. No more. You
know what fruit does to you. I said no.</i>

162
00:10:42,843 --> 00:10:47,646
Mmm. Mm. Oh.

163
00:10:50,851 --> 00:10:54,919
<i>Hey, Professor
krippendorf, nice to see you back.</i>

164
00:11:42,102 --> 00:11:45,270
<i>Well, I guess you can</i>
<i>come home again.</i>

165
00:11:45,272 --> 00:11:47,272
Ruth.

166
00:11:47,274 --> 00:11:50,075
Popo. How are you?

167
00:11:50,077 --> 00:11:52,811
He's a little flatulent today.

168
00:11:52,813 --> 00:11:55,013
Oh, that was him.

169
00:11:55,015 --> 00:11:59,350
Oh, James, you've always
had such a way with toilet humor.

170
00:11:59,352 --> 00:12:02,187
Which reminds me, I'm so looking
forward to tonight's lecture.

171
00:12:02,189 --> 00:12:05,757
Are you? <i>You know, I've
always wanted to ask you,</i>

172
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:08,359
did Jennifer write this
grant proposal, or did you?

173
00:12:08,361 --> 00:12:10,295
Why do you ask?

174
00:12:10,297 --> 00:12:15,900
Well, Jennifer, as we all know, was
brilliant, but this proposal is so vague,

175
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:18,403
so insubstantial,

176
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:21,106
so... you.

177
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:24,375
How are you?

178
00:12:24,377 --> 00:12:27,145
I'm fine, Ruth. Thank
you so much for asking.

179
00:12:27,147 --> 00:12:30,815
I'm so glad to hear that. I'm not
gonna wish you luck tonight...

180
00:12:30,817 --> 00:12:32,817
Because I know
you don't need it.

181
00:12:32,819 --> 00:12:37,055
I'll say a little prayer instead.

182
00:12:48,802 --> 00:12:51,903
I have... nothing!

183
00:12:56,476 --> 00:12:58,977
Come on, man! Hey, wait up!

184
00:12:58,979 --> 00:13:01,980
<i>Children,
your biological father is here.</i>

185
00:13:01,982 --> 00:13:04,415
- You're late.
- Oh, see ya!

186
00:13:04,417 --> 00:13:08,353
Oh, why don't the
children spend the night here?

187
00:13:08,355 --> 00:13:10,989
Are you serious? Again?
Sounds like a no.

188
00:13:10,991 --> 00:13:13,258
Open. Go, go, go! What are you trying
to do, turn the children against us?

189
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:16,294
Yes, Irene, it's part of
my master plan. Shelly.

190
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:19,964
How you managed to drag our daughter
to those squalid jungles...

191
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:21,866
Still remains a mystery to me.

192
00:13:21,868 --> 00:13:26,104
He didn't have to drag her. My mother
was an eminent anthropologist.

193
00:13:26,106 --> 00:13:28,840
Thank you. And whatever her
reasons for marrying dad were,

194
00:13:28,842 --> 00:13:31,042
we'll never know. I think.

195
00:13:31,044 --> 00:13:34,045
But no one ever
dragged mom anywhere.

196
00:13:34,047 --> 00:13:36,281
Angry.

197
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:42,453
Ooh.

198
00:13:42,455 --> 00:13:45,490
<i>Can I help the next
person in line please?</i>

199
00:13:55,535 --> 00:13:58,570
<i>Nine-piece mcnugget, please.</i>

200
00:14:01,908 --> 00:14:04,075
What?

201
00:14:04,077 --> 00:14:07,011
Isn't it a little bit late
to be writing your speech now?

202
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:10,915
I'm polishing. <i> Want it?
Want it? Come get it.</i>

203
00:14:10,917 --> 00:14:14,519
Come on, you poor baby.
Come on. You jerk.

204
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:18,223
<i>You wanna get it?</i> Son of a...
oh, just...

205
00:14:18,225 --> 00:14:20,558
<i>way to go, Edmund.</i>
What is this?

206
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:24,095
It's what's left of that stupid space
shuttle bank you bought him in Orlando.

207
00:14:24,097 --> 00:14:28,099
He put it in the blender. It's a piece of crap.
<i>All right, settle down.</i>

208
00:14:28,101 --> 00:14:30,101
Settle down! <i> Loser!</i>

209
00:14:30,103 --> 00:14:33,004
What a bunch of savages.

210
00:14:33,006 --> 00:14:37,075
Ow. I have an idea.

211
00:14:37,077 --> 00:14:40,545
All right, come on. Settle up...
down. Now listen.

212
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:44,215
Why don't we...
why don't we... wait.

213
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:49,554
Why don't we, um, do what
normal families do, okay?

214
00:14:49,556 --> 00:14:51,990
They sit around the dinner table
and they tell stories.

215
00:14:51,992 --> 00:14:56,127
<i>Huh? What do you think?</i> Oh, it's fabulous.
Party time.

216
00:14:56,129 --> 00:14:58,596
W-what kind of stories?

217
00:14:58,598 --> 00:15:01,132
Stories. Golly.

218
00:15:01,134 --> 00:15:04,102
You know, like about one of our
trips to new Guinea together.

219
00:15:04,104 --> 00:15:07,605
And why's that?

220
00:15:07,607 --> 00:15:12,110
And boys, let's try to be
as detailed as possible.

221
00:15:12,112 --> 00:15:14,245
<i>Edmund?</i>

222
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:16,948
No, no, talk to me.
Talk to your dad.

223
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:19,284
<i>Talk to me for once.</i>

224
00:15:19,286 --> 00:15:22,453
Everything was green
and beautiful.

225
00:15:22,455 --> 00:15:25,023
Then mom died.

226
00:15:30,964 --> 00:15:34,599
<i>Jimmy, can you
drop some fries, please?</i>

227
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:37,035
That was a good idea.

228
00:15:37,037 --> 00:15:39,570
<i>Get back here, you loser!</i>

229
00:15:41,408 --> 00:15:43,641
Mickey. Gotcha.

230
00:15:43,643 --> 00:15:46,177
Get off him. Come on!

231
00:15:46,179 --> 00:15:48,579
Get inside. Get up the steps.
Get inside.

232
00:15:48,581 --> 00:15:50,581
I'm sick of this.
Hey-hey, hey-hey, hey.

233
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:53,451
I spoke to him this morning...
oh, excuse me.

234
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:56,154
Uh, Professor krippendorf.
Oh, tinker bell.

235
00:15:56,156 --> 00:15:58,122
Hello. Listen, I've been
trying to call you all day...

236
00:15:58,124 --> 00:16:00,525
Because I have these great publicity ideas
that I wanted to talk to you about.

237
00:16:00,527 --> 00:16:02,727
I would rather that you didn't.

238
00:16:02,729 --> 00:16:07,598
As a matter of fact, I would
rather that you back off.

239
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,101
Excuse me. I, uh...

240
00:16:17,043 --> 00:16:19,077
Thank you, God.

241
00:16:22,749 --> 00:16:26,217
Good evening. Gentlemen.

242
00:16:26,219 --> 00:16:29,020
My name
is Professor krippendorf.

243
00:16:29,022 --> 00:16:32,190
Uh, Professor. <i>I'm here to begin the...
what, what, what?</i>

244
00:16:32,192 --> 00:16:35,126
Your lecture's across the hall.

245
00:16:38,765 --> 00:16:41,432
Excuse me.

246
00:16:41,434 --> 00:16:43,434
<i>Come on.</i>

247
00:16:43,436 --> 00:16:45,470
Get in there and behave yourself.
Lecture's in here.

248
00:16:45,472 --> 00:16:47,672
Quiet. Come on. Come on, come on.
I'm sick of this.

249
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:50,708
Right this way. Come on,
come on, come on, come on.

250
00:16:58,618 --> 00:17:00,551
Gerald.

251
00:17:00,553 --> 00:17:02,553
That's krippendorf.
Krippendorf.

252
00:17:02,555 --> 00:17:06,157
James! Professor krippendorf.
Look, everybody.

253
00:17:06,159 --> 00:17:10,228
Gerald, I have something important
to tell you. What, now?

254
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:14,465
James, what the hell's wrong with you?
Are you nervous?

255
00:17:14,467 --> 00:17:17,135
Gerald. <i>Don't you see
the crowd out there?</i>

256
00:17:17,137 --> 00:17:19,170
I'm telling ya, this is hot.

257
00:17:19,172 --> 00:17:21,172
Let me ask you a question,
Gerald.

258
00:17:21,174 --> 00:17:24,275
How long have we known
each other? Twenty years.

259
00:17:24,277 --> 00:17:29,213
Charlie farrick's office. As soon as we
finish sprucing it up, it's yours, all yours.

260
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:31,215
Good. Uh, you see,
the thing is,

261
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:35,319
uh, after Jennifer died,
I kinda cracked up.

262
00:17:35,321 --> 00:17:38,523
<i>You know, if it was just me...
</i> farrick's going to jail.

263
00:17:38,525 --> 00:17:41,592
Uh, jail? <i>Yeah.</i>

264
00:17:41,594 --> 00:17:43,528
Charlie farrick
is going to jail?

265
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:46,130
Can you believe the son of a
bitch was robbing us blind?

266
00:17:46,132 --> 00:17:48,266
He was? <i>Oh, yeah.</i>

267
00:17:48,268 --> 00:17:53,137
He stole. He stole grant
money for personal use.

268
00:17:53,139 --> 00:17:56,507
He did? <i>Oh, yeah, and he
never even did the research.</i>

269
00:17:56,509 --> 00:17:58,509
I'm talkin' about
New York hotels,

270
00:17:58,511 --> 00:18:00,778
Broadway plays,
flowers, hookers.

271
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:04,248
Uh, oh, uh...

272
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:08,820
golly, you know, people do
this kind of thing all the time.

273
00:18:08,822 --> 00:18:13,224
Not to me, they don't.
Not to me.

274
00:18:13,226 --> 00:18:15,827
Charlie's gonna do time
for this, Jimmy.

275
00:18:15,829 --> 00:18:18,830
Hard time.

276
00:18:18,832 --> 00:18:23,835
So, you ready, huh? You ready to go out
there and razzle-dazzle them, buddy?

277
00:18:23,837 --> 00:18:25,837
Huh? Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

278
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:28,372
All right, let's go!

279
00:18:35,215 --> 00:18:40,551
I'm telling you, this is gonna be big.
Really big. It better be.

280
00:18:42,322 --> 00:18:44,355
Hi.

281
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:52,163
Excuse me, people. Could we settle down?
Can I have some quiet, please?

282
00:18:52,165 --> 00:18:54,298
<i>Everybody take their seats.</i>

283
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:57,835
<i>Good. Thank you.</i>

284
00:18:57,837 --> 00:19:00,771
- <i> Ladies and gentlemen.</i>
- He's terrified.

285
00:19:00,773 --> 00:19:04,842
Colleagues, distinguished
guests, president Porter.

286
00:19:04,844 --> 00:19:09,313
<i>The moment we've all been eagerly
anticipating has finally arrived.</i>

287
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:14,318
<i>I know, you're all chomping at the bit to
hear about this truly astonishing work.</i>

288
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,655
So without further adieu
and with great pride,

289
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:21,359
<i>I give you my old friend</i>
<i>and distinguished colleague,</i>

290
00:19:21,361 --> 00:19:24,295
Professor James krippendorf.

291
00:19:38,444 --> 00:19:42,280
Thank you very much
for, uh, for coming.

292
00:19:44,417 --> 00:19:49,420
Uh, first, I-I, uh,
would like to, uh, apologize...

293
00:19:49,422 --> 00:19:54,625
For the abbreviated nature
of this first proxmire lecture.

294
00:19:54,627 --> 00:19:58,496
I'd like to thank the department
for the extra time to prepare...

295
00:19:58,498 --> 00:20:01,232
Before I did
these presentations.

296
00:20:02,202 --> 00:20:04,435
He doesn't have anything.

297
00:20:04,437 --> 00:20:07,772
Thank you, thank you.
Thank you so much.

298
00:20:09,275 --> 00:20:13,544
Okay, the tribe
in question. Um...

299
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:17,582
the tribe in question,
uh, um...

300
00:20:19,252 --> 00:20:23,421
well, isolated from the world
by, uh, mountains...

301
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:27,425
And, uh, uh,
extensive swamp land,

302
00:20:27,427 --> 00:20:31,729
uh, the, uh, tribe in question had
been untouched by civilization...

303
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:34,532
Until, uh, two years ago...

304
00:20:34,534 --> 00:20:36,901
When it was discovered...

305
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:41,806
By my wife and myself.

306
00:20:41,808 --> 00:20:45,509
Um... questions?

307
00:20:49,515 --> 00:20:52,483
Okay. Okay.

308
00:20:55,455 --> 00:20:59,490
The, uh... the, uh, um...

309
00:20:59,492 --> 00:21:01,892
- Professor krippendorf?
- Yes.

310
00:21:01,894 --> 00:21:04,462
In the proposal for this grant,

311
00:21:04,464 --> 00:21:08,866
<i>"I believe
when found, they will astound us."</i>

312
00:21:08,868 --> 00:21:12,937
Yes, uh, that, yes... "they will astound
us." Yes, that's exactly right.

313
00:21:12,939 --> 00:21:14,939
Give us an example.

314
00:21:14,941 --> 00:21:18,843
- Uh, an example of...
- Of how they will astound us.

315
00:21:18,845 --> 00:21:20,878
Of how they will astound us.
Yes.

316
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,649
Um, well, they will astound us...
you, um...

317
00:21:27,487 --> 00:21:32,623
uh, because they have
a domestic unit.

318
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:36,427
A domestic unit,
which until now...

319
00:21:36,429 --> 00:21:40,598
Is unheard of
in neolithic society.

320
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,401
And what is this domestic unit?

321
00:21:43,403 --> 00:21:48,939
That is a, uh... what we would
call a single-parent home.

322
00:21:51,611 --> 00:21:54,979
<i>You're saying a young female...</i>

323
00:21:54,981 --> 00:21:58,382
Is allowed to raise
a family by herself?

324
00:21:58,384 --> 00:22:01,485
No, I am... I am saying something
more remarkable than that.

325
00:22:01,487 --> 00:22:06,691
I am saying that, uh, the single
parent in this instance... is male.

326
00:22:14,801 --> 00:22:17,468
Well, that's a first.

327
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:19,503
I find it fascinating.

328
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:21,605
So do I, Professor micelli.

329
00:22:21,607 --> 00:22:26,010
As a matter of fact, the single father...
if I might call him that...

330
00:22:26,012 --> 00:22:29,347
is highly regarded
in this community.

331
00:22:29,349 --> 00:22:32,717
He is called the<i> utabaji,</i>

332
00:22:32,719 --> 00:22:37,922
which literally translates as
"the esteemed single parent."

333
00:22:37,924 --> 00:22:41,425
You mean the male in question
did not run off...

334
00:22:41,427 --> 00:22:44,562
And find another female
to immediately oppress?

335
00:22:44,564 --> 00:22:46,664
No, that's not the way
they operate.

336
00:22:46,666 --> 00:22:52,470
As a matter of fact, with all of the
incredible difficulty that they have,

337
00:22:52,472 --> 00:22:55,373
single fathers with children...

338
00:22:55,375 --> 00:22:59,977
Have immense pride in the
comfort and cleanliness...

339
00:22:59,979 --> 00:23:03,447
<i>Of their domestic hut.</i>
What are they called?

340
00:23:03,449 --> 00:23:05,449
Huh?

341
00:23:05,451 --> 00:23:08,919
Do they have a name,
Professor krippendorf?

342
00:23:10,156 --> 00:23:15,393
Of course they have a name.
Uh, uh...

343
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:24,969
the, uh, the "shelmikedmu."

344
00:23:27,573 --> 00:23:30,941
- The shel... shelmikedmu.
- What?

345
00:23:30,943 --> 00:23:33,844
The shelmikedmu.

346
00:23:33,846 --> 00:23:37,515
But, Professor,
without sexual partners,

347
00:23:37,517 --> 00:23:42,720
would this not cause problems for the,
uh, social balance of the community?

348
00:23:42,722 --> 00:23:45,723
Ah, that is
an excellent question.

349
00:23:45,725 --> 00:23:48,592
Thank you very much.
That is a superb question.

350
00:23:48,594 --> 00:23:51,195
As a matter of fact, we do have
an object here today...

351
00:23:51,197 --> 00:23:56,534
Which solves that very problem
that you were mentioning.

352
00:23:56,536 --> 00:23:58,769
I'm sorry. Here.

353
00:23:58,771 --> 00:24:02,740
All right, now, uh,
this little item here...

354
00:24:02,742 --> 00:24:07,645
Is called by the
shelmikedmu a<i> shutal.</i>

355
00:24:07,647 --> 00:24:11,649
<i>A</i> shutal,<i> see?</i>
That takes talent.

356
00:24:11,651 --> 00:24:13,651
It's a very, very
powerful totem.

357
00:24:13,653 --> 00:24:18,489
It has, as you can see,
both a male and a female plug.

358
00:24:18,491 --> 00:24:22,026
<i>And it is, in fact,</i>
<i>a marital device.</i>

359
00:24:22,028 --> 00:24:26,630
I-I-it's a neolithic dildo.

360
00:24:30,636 --> 00:24:36,474
Would you care to, uh... pass
that down to Dr. Allen, please.

361
00:24:36,476 --> 00:24:38,709
<i>You can take it home for
the weekend if you'd like.</i>

362
00:24:38,711 --> 00:24:42,613
Hmm.

363
00:24:45,885 --> 00:24:48,619
Thank you.

364
00:24:48,621 --> 00:24:51,021
Wonderful. You were great.

365
00:24:51,023 --> 00:24:55,226
Outstanding! I especially liked the way you
handled our resident blowhard, Ruth Allen.

366
00:24:55,228 --> 00:24:57,862
That was beautiful. Beautiful.

367
00:24:57,864 --> 00:25:00,664
I would do anything
to be part of this.

368
00:25:00,666 --> 00:25:02,633
Professor krippendorf. <i>Oh!</i>

369
00:25:02,635 --> 00:25:06,971
<i>Mrs. Proxmire will be thrilled
when I tell her how well it went.</i>

370
00:25:06,973 --> 00:25:09,173
Thank you, thank you.
Quite a relief.

371
00:25:09,175 --> 00:25:11,742
Oh, yes. Yes, yes.

372
00:25:11,744 --> 00:25:15,279
When can I see the film?

373
00:25:15,281 --> 00:25:18,682
You do have film, don't you?

374
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:25,623
Of course he has film. Oh, my
God, it's magnificent film.

375
00:25:25,625 --> 00:25:28,792
The imagery. When I first
saw it, I was amazed.

376
00:25:28,794 --> 00:25:32,897
Excellent. I'll plan to screen
some at the lecture on Friday.

377
00:25:32,899 --> 00:25:34,899
We'll be there. <i>Mm-hmm.</i>

378
00:25:34,901 --> 00:25:38,669
See you then.
Isn't this exciting?

379
00:25:38,671 --> 00:25:42,072
Ow. What?
Footage is good, isn't it?

380
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:49,647
Professor krippendorf,
this is Mr. Schramm at the bank.

381
00:25:49,649 --> 00:25:54,018
I still have not received your check.
Call me.

382
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:57,121
Thank you.

383
00:25:59,191 --> 00:26:02,293
- What's this for?
- A urine sample.

384
00:26:02,295 --> 00:26:05,262
I wanna know what drugs you're on.
I had to tell them something.

385
00:26:05,264 --> 00:26:08,482
How about the truth?

386
00:26:08,483 --> 00:26:11,701
That I spent all the money and I didn't
complete the research. That'd dazzle 'em.

387
00:26:11,704 --> 00:26:16,240
- How big a grant did they give you?
- A hundred thousand.

388
00:26:16,242 --> 00:26:18,676
Dollars? Awesome.

389
00:26:18,678 --> 00:26:23,647
<i>We didn't spend it all in new Guinea, so
how could you squander that much money?</i>

390
00:26:23,649 --> 00:26:26,250
Squander? Squander?

391
00:26:26,252 --> 00:26:30,621
Let's think about this, my little
"squandees." Food, clothing, shelter.

392
00:26:30,623 --> 00:26:33,791
<i>Big screen tvs, vcrs,</i>
<i>counseling sessions.</i>

393
00:26:33,793 --> 00:26:36,260
Those were a waste of time.
Clearly.

394
00:26:36,262 --> 00:26:39,597
T-they expect to see
film footage.

395
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:41,632
Excuse me. Who is the
adult in this room?

396
00:26:41,634 --> 00:26:43,834
Don't answer that! I am
the adult in this room.

397
00:26:43,836 --> 00:26:47,237
<i>The adult in this
room doesn't have any film footage.</i>

398
00:26:47,239 --> 00:26:50,341
And do you know why?
Because there is no tribe.

399
00:26:50,343 --> 00:26:54,945
<i>Yeah? Well, everybody in that audience
tonight thinks there is a tribe.</i>

400
00:26:54,947 --> 00:26:57,281
That's true.

401
00:26:57,283 --> 00:27:01,018
That is very, very true.

402
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:02,987
What are you saying?

403
00:27:02,989 --> 00:27:05,022
What I am saying is...

404
00:27:05,024 --> 00:27:07,625
That you take
a little nishowiku...

405
00:27:07,627 --> 00:27:09,893
And you add a little imatosa,

406
00:27:09,895 --> 00:27:12,696
and you throw in a dash
of katanka,

407
00:27:12,698 --> 00:27:16,800
and you've got
the shelmikedmu, huh?

408
00:27:16,802 --> 00:27:21,805
They want the shelmikedmu, they're
gonna get the shelmikedmu.

409
00:27:21,807 --> 00:27:24,241
Huh?

410
00:27:24,243 --> 00:27:27,011
<i>So, uh, let's
get some palm trees.</i>

411
00:27:27,013 --> 00:27:30,147
No palm trees.
We don't need palm trees.

412
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:34,251
<i>All right, uh, Venus flytraps?
Venus flytraps?</i>

413
00:27:34,253 --> 00:27:34,753
¶¶

414
00:27:43,996 --> 00:27:46,764
<i>have you ever been</i>
<i>close to tragedy</i>

415

<i>I never had to knock on

420
00:28:03,849 --> 00:28:06,150
I'm working on it.

421
00:28:06,152 --> 00:28:08,752
It needs to be about
this much wider. Okay.

422
00:28:08,754 --> 00:28:10,754
Look at this. Yes.

423
00:28:10,756 --> 00:28:14,992
<i>I never had to</i>
<i>knock on wood</i>

424

oh, hello, pumpkin.
How are you?

428
00:28:28,874 --> 00:28:30,841
Do you remember me from yesterday?
I'm Veronica micelli.

429
00:28:30,843 --> 00:28:33,744
I'm friends with your daddy. I brought
this really nice reporter here.

430
00:28:33,746 --> 00:28:35,879
We just wanna ask him
a couple of questions...

431
00:28:39,151 --> 00:28:43,987
<i>I never had to</i>
<i>knock on wood</i>

432

435
00:28:56,902 --> 00:28:59,336
come on, guys!

436
00:28:59,338 --> 00:29:02,072
We're losin' the light.

437
00:29:02,074 --> 00:29:07,978
Hey! The shelmikedmu do not allow pictures
taken without the ritual body paint on.

438
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:10,748
- Nicely put.
- It is our way.

439
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:12,816
Yo!

440
00:29:16,889 --> 00:29:19,823
It's really great, you know that?
What?

441
00:29:19,825 --> 00:29:22,059
The way you are.

442
00:29:22,061 --> 00:29:25,829
You know, always helping out around
here, doing things for us...

443
00:29:25,831 --> 00:29:28,832
the answer is no. What?

444
00:29:28,834 --> 00:29:30,968
I'm not playing boo-boo,
the native girl.

445
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:32,936
Shelly, it's only one film.

446
00:29:32,938 --> 00:29:34,772
You're a fraud.

447
00:29:36,942 --> 00:29:39,143
I need you.

448
00:29:40,546 --> 00:29:42,546
No way.

449
00:29:42,548 --> 00:29:45,983
<i>Shelly!</i>

450
00:29:48,854 --> 00:29:53,323
<i>Now catch the chicken.</i> If it doesn't
come in a bucket, I don't touch it.

451
00:29:53,325 --> 00:29:56,093
Shelly, don't break my hump,
okay?

452
00:29:56,095 --> 00:29:58,295
<i>Catch the chicken. They're
gonna repossess my hut.</i>

453
00:29:58,297 --> 00:30:00,330
Come on, come on.
Let's go. Let's go.

454
00:30:00,332 --> 00:30:02,366
Go, go, go! Go!

455
00:30:02,368 --> 00:30:04,568
All right, that's it.
That's it.

456
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:06,170
<i>Quicker, quicker.</i>
<i>Come on, let's go.</i>

457
00:30:06,172 --> 00:30:07,538
Shelly! Shelly!
<i>That's it. Come on.</i>

458
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:10,407
<i>Get your hands</i>
<i>on the little son of a...</i>

459
00:30:10,409 --> 00:30:13,977
e-excellent work.
Very, very good.

460
00:30:13,979 --> 00:30:16,246
- Now what?
- Now cook the chicken.

461
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:23,220
I just chased poultry through my
backyard looking like Tammy faye bakker.

462
00:30:23,222 --> 00:30:25,222
You owe me.

463
00:30:25,224 --> 00:30:27,524
Thank you, boo-boo.
Where are you going?

464
00:30:27,526 --> 00:30:30,027
To a friend's. <i> She
doesn't have any friends.</i>

465
00:30:30,029 --> 00:30:31,595
<i>Shut up!</i> Besides, you're
part of our tribe.

466
00:30:31,597 --> 00:30:35,566
There is no tribe.
Oh, and one small point:

467
00:30:35,568 --> 00:30:39,136
<i>Maybe Edmund's tutu</i>
<i>should have a few more leaves.</i>

468
00:30:39,138 --> 00:30:44,041
- I mean, how many neolithic tribes practice circumcision?
- Whoops.

469
00:30:47,546 --> 00:30:50,480
Boo-boo has made
an excellent point.

470
00:30:50,482 --> 00:30:53,050
<i>That</i> will be the subject
of our film.

471
00:30:53,052 --> 00:30:55,485
A rare, primitive
circumcision ritual.

472
00:30:55,487 --> 00:30:59,189
Yes! In which the older brother
performs the actual deed.

473
00:31:02,328 --> 00:31:05,329
<i>No, no, no, no, no.</i>

474
00:31:05,331 --> 00:31:08,198
This is not<i> nightmare</i>
<i>on "shelmikedmu" street.</i>

475
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:12,436
This is a delicate ritual
between brothers.

476
00:31:12,438 --> 00:31:14,471
Sh... sorry.

477
00:31:14,473 --> 00:31:17,908
All right, your wee-wee's on the log.
Okay. Now what?

478
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:22,012
The young shelmikedmu boy
sits at the<i> egala</i> altar...

479
00:31:22,014 --> 00:31:24,648
Waiting for his older brother to guide
him through the portals of manhood.

480
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:27,651
<i>Egala</i> altar.
That's a nice little detail.

481
00:31:27,653 --> 00:31:31,488
There's a spider on the log.

482
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:34,057
Oh, oh, oh.

483
00:31:34,059 --> 00:31:37,494
Oh, oh. Mickey.
There was a spider.

484
00:31:39,298 --> 00:31:43,033
Oh. Whatever.

485
00:31:43,035 --> 00:31:47,070
Okay, let the ceremony begin.

486
00:31:52,278 --> 00:31:56,546
Excuse me, uh, what exactly
is the older brother doing?

487
00:31:56,548 --> 00:31:58,982
He is completing
the ritual dance...

488
00:31:58,984 --> 00:32:01,485
In which he asks the gods
to protect the young boy...

489
00:32:01,487 --> 00:32:04,922
From many brides who want him
and his pig wealth.

490
00:32:04,924 --> 00:32:07,524
Hey, you put a lot of thought
into this, haven't you?

491
00:32:07,526 --> 00:32:10,994
It's my tribe. <i>Yeah. All right.
Now, wait, wait, wait.</i>

492
00:32:10,996 --> 00:32:15,332
Edmund, you're... you're looking
up to the gods with trepidation.

493
00:32:16,468 --> 00:32:19,102
Trepidation.

494
00:32:19,104 --> 00:32:22,573
Trepidation, trepidation,
trepidation.

495
00:32:22,574 --> 00:32:26,043
Um, well, you're really afraid that your
brother is going to chop your wee-wee off.

496
00:32:26,045 --> 00:32:27,945
Ah, there we go.
Excellent trepidation.

497
00:32:29,949 --> 00:32:33,984
All right, here's the footage
from our last trip to new Guinea.

498
00:32:39,525 --> 00:32:42,559
[ Tape audio in fast forward ]

499
00:32:52,171 --> 00:32:55,973
Okay, we just need to shoot
a few more pieces.

500
00:32:55,975 --> 00:32:58,542
Look at the camera.
One, two, three, ah!

501
00:32:58,544 --> 00:33:00,510
Come on, ah! Ah!

502
00:33:00,512 --> 00:33:04,114
- One, two, three.
- Ah!

503
00:33:05,451 --> 00:33:08,285
Excellent. Did you get that?

504
00:33:08,287 --> 00:33:12,155
No, here. Tilt that.
There you are.

505
00:33:12,157 --> 00:33:15,726
Can you see him now? There we go.
Okay, ready?

506
00:33:15,728 --> 00:33:17,761
<i>Magunga.</i>

507
00:33:17,763 --> 00:33:21,565
Edmund, look miserable.

508
00:33:21,567 --> 00:33:23,633
Excellent.

509
00:33:27,106 --> 00:33:29,573
Here goes nothin'.

510
00:33:36,715 --> 00:33:40,083
Good job.

511
00:33:40,085 --> 00:33:44,354
<i>At first glance, the shelmikedmu appear to
be a somewhat typical new Guinea tribe,</i>

512
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:49,126
<i>as unremarkable</i>
<i>as they are undiscovered.</i>

513
00:33:49,128 --> 00:33:52,262
However, that all changed
when we began to focus in...

514
00:33:52,264 --> 00:33:56,199
<i>On one particular family unit.</i>

515
00:33:57,603 --> 00:34:00,103
<i>Although there is, uh,</i>
<i>no evidence,</i>

516
00:34:00,105 --> 00:34:04,608
uh, of circumcision
among other new Guinea tribes,

517
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:08,812
we find that circumcision is a
ritual used by the shelmikedmu.

518
00:34:10,783 --> 00:34:15,452
<i>Now, the uncircumcised child</i>
<i>of a shelmikedmu family here...</i>

519
00:34:15,454 --> 00:34:20,157
Is waiting patiently at the<i> egala
</i> altar for his older brother...

520
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:22,626
<i>Who will be the one</i>
<i>to guide him into manhood.</i>

521
00:34:22,628 --> 00:34:26,596
<i>Magunga. Here, the older boy is

522
00:34:26,598 --> 00:34:29,599
By the native shaman.

523
00:34:29,601 --> 00:34:32,602
Now, this axe, which has been
fashioned from stone,

524
00:34:32,604 --> 00:34:37,574
has been used to circumcise tribal members
for thousands and thousands of years.

525
00:34:42,281 --> 00:34:47,184
Now, this is interesting. The older brother
here is performing a ritual dance,

526
00:34:47,186 --> 00:34:52,322
the purpose of which is to ask
the gods for a steady hand...

527
00:34:52,324 --> 00:34:56,560
For what will surely be
a delicate, uh, procedure.

528
00:34:58,697 --> 00:35:01,798
And here we are.

529
00:35:14,813 --> 00:35:16,880
Ah!

530
00:35:21,587 --> 00:35:23,553
Quite remarkable, yes?

531
00:35:23,555 --> 00:35:26,323
Amazing. <i> Professor krippendorf.</i>

532
00:35:26,325 --> 00:35:28,492
Professor krippendorf, I wonder if you could
talk to a couple of my students here.

533
00:35:28,494 --> 00:35:31,361
I'm sorry, I have to go to my
son's science fair. Scientist!

534
00:35:31,363 --> 00:35:34,297
Chip off the old block. <i>Oh,
Professor krippendorf. Professor.</i>

535
00:35:34,299 --> 00:35:36,166
Professor, I have somebody
I want you to meet.

536
00:35:36,168 --> 00:35:39,369
May I speak to you
privately for a second?

537
00:35:39,371 --> 00:35:43,573
This is an interview with Veronica
micelli about the shelmikedmu.

538
00:35:43,575 --> 00:35:45,776
Yeah, I know. Does that upset you?
Yes, it does upset me.

539
00:35:45,777 --> 00:35:48,378
Thank you. God. See, me,
too, because they told us...

540
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:51,148
They were gonna give us a
full-color photo and three columns.

541
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:53,884
You had no right
to give this interview.

542
00:35:53,886 --> 00:35:59,222
What? This paper has a circulation of 35,000, James.
That's not the point!

543
00:35:59,224 --> 00:36:01,324
Professor! Thank you so much.
Thank you.

544
00:36:01,326 --> 00:36:05,295
Will you shut up! It is not your lecture.
It is not her tribe.

545
00:36:05,297 --> 00:36:07,931
It has nothing to do with you.

546
00:36:07,933 --> 00:36:12,369
And this article is a brazen
attempt at self-promotion.

547
00:36:12,371 --> 00:36:15,739
I am crushed that
you would say that, James.

548
00:36:15,741 --> 00:36:17,941
May I call you James? No!

549
00:36:17,943 --> 00:36:20,277
But, speaking of promotion, I
have someone I want you to meet.

550
00:36:20,279 --> 00:36:22,679
Professor krippendorf,
meet Henry "spivvey."

551
00:36:22,681 --> 00:36:25,649
Spivey. I'm a great admirer
of yours, Professor.

552
00:36:25,651 --> 00:36:29,319
I could not have been more thrilled
to receive your call. My call?

553
00:36:29,321 --> 00:36:32,222
Well, Mr. Spivey operates
a new cable TV network...

554
00:36:32,224 --> 00:36:34,958
Dedicated to anthropology
called<i> primal time.</i>

555
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:39,362
- You're joking?
<i>- No, I am not, and I want you to come on board.</i>

556
00:36:39,364 --> 00:36:41,731
Give me the television rights
to the shelmikedmu story.

557
00:36:41,733 --> 00:36:44,634
No.

558
00:36:44,636 --> 00:36:49,272
Professor, we share the goal of making
anthropology accessible to the common man.

559
00:36:49,274 --> 00:36:52,609
The common
man could give a shit.

560
00:36:52,611 --> 00:36:56,947
Well, no, that's just because anthropology
has never been presented to them...

561
00:36:56,949 --> 00:36:59,416
As relevant
to their lives before.

562
00:36:59,418 --> 00:37:02,886
Our little shelmikedmu deal with the
same problems that we face every day:

563
00:37:02,888 --> 00:37:06,690
Loneliness, despair,
intense sexual longing.

564
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:11,294
<i>Uh, next we have
Michael krippendorf...</i>

565
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:16,433
<i>With his project on a tribe
from the jungles of new Guinea.</i>

566
00:37:16,435 --> 00:37:18,635
<i>All right, Michael.</i>

567
00:37:33,252 --> 00:37:37,387
I am a member
of the shelmikedmu tribe.

568
00:37:37,389 --> 00:37:40,690
<i>These pigs, a staple</i>
<i>of the shelmikedmu's economy,</i>

569
00:37:40,692 --> 00:37:43,793
are adorned with hornbilled beaks
and bird-of-paradise feathers.

570
00:37:43,795 --> 00:37:47,664
<i>This structure is called</i>
<i>an</i> ojatani.

571
00:37:47,666 --> 00:37:50,367
It is used only once
by the women of my tribe.

572
00:37:50,369 --> 00:37:53,837
It is built to house
a young virgin...

573
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:57,507
Experiencing
her first menstruation.

574
00:37:57,509 --> 00:38:00,277
What did he say?

575
00:38:03,448 --> 00:38:08,285
At first signs of menses, the young
female is anointed with pig urine...

576
00:38:08,287 --> 00:38:11,588
<i>And placed in the</i> menarpat, <i>where
she will remain for three days...</i>

577
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:14,691
<i>Until the spirits of maidenhood have left her body.
</i> Isn't that interesting?

578
00:38:14,693 --> 00:38:17,861
Thank you, Michael. Next we have
Adam kant and his lima bean graphs.

579
00:38:17,863 --> 00:38:20,730
Because she's in her first days
of menstruation,

580
00:38:20,732 --> 00:38:25,835
- I've placed abbey tournquist in the<i> menarpat.</i>
- Oh, my God, it's abbey!

581
00:38:25,837 --> 00:38:28,438
I shall now douse her
with the sacred pig urine.

582
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:29,906
Aaaah!

583
00:38:32,511 --> 00:38:36,379
Please, don't do this.

584
00:38:36,381 --> 00:38:39,983
- <i> No problem, no problem. Can I talk to you?</i>
- Abbey, come out of there now!

585
00:38:39,985 --> 00:38:43,720
Not until I'm purified.

586
00:38:43,722 --> 00:38:46,656
<i>Discuss it?
Discuss? Discuss what?</i>

587
00:38:46,658 --> 00:38:50,360
<i>I am not sending my
kids to any boarding school.</i>

588
00:38:50,362 --> 00:38:52,729
Hey! Time out,
time out, time out!

589
00:38:52,731 --> 00:38:56,499
Unfortunately, these problems
are not confined to Mickey.

590
00:38:56,501 --> 00:38:59,002
<i>His behavior seems to be</i>
<i>affecting Edmund.</i>

591
00:38:59,004 --> 00:39:04,574
Edmund was asked to draw "what I
enjoyed most about my weekend."

592
00:39:06,044 --> 00:39:08,611
Let me take a look at that drawing.
I wanna see the drawing.

593
00:39:08,613 --> 00:39:10,613
What is the matter with you?
Get your hands off of it.

594
00:39:10,615 --> 00:39:13,416
Would you stop acting
like a child?

595
00:39:13,418 --> 00:39:16,419
All right, let's just
calm down here.

596
00:39:16,421 --> 00:39:19,389
The fact is, a school
like Chester hills,

597
00:39:19,391 --> 00:39:23,560
<i>with its emphasis on discipline,</i>
<i>is probably a better choice.</i>

598
00:39:23,562 --> 00:39:26,062
My sentiments exactly.

599
00:39:30,736 --> 00:39:32,802
I apologize.

600
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:38,375
I guess things might have
gotten out of hand,

601
00:39:38,377 --> 00:39:41,444
<i>and, uh, I'm not making</i>
<i>any excuses,</i>

602
00:39:41,446 --> 00:39:45,382
but I should take
responsibility for this.

603
00:39:45,384 --> 00:39:47,917
I don't want my kids
to go to boarding school,

604
00:39:47,919 --> 00:39:50,787
so from now on,
no more crazy behavior.

605
00:39:50,789 --> 00:39:54,023
Things are gonna change.
I give you my word.

606
00:39:54,025 --> 00:39:57,594
<i>Another magical day in the
krippendorf household, Mr. Schramm.</i>

607
00:39:57,596 --> 00:40:01,264
The children are all ready
for school,

608
00:40:01,265 --> 00:40:04,933
and they're clean and coiffed and anxious
to embark on another day of learning.

609
00:40:04,936 --> 00:40:07,971
Mickey, take that headdress off.
I mean, take that red dress off.

610
00:40:07,973 --> 00:40:12,475
I mean, take that red dress
and give it to your sister.

611
00:40:12,477 --> 00:40:15,412
What? I... no, sir.

612
00:40:15,414 --> 00:40:18,181
No, sir, the check is in the...
yes, I'll hold.

613
00:40:18,183 --> 00:40:20,417
Of course I'll hold.

614
00:40:20,419 --> 00:40:22,452
Good morning, sweetheart.

615
00:40:22,454 --> 00:40:27,857
Darling, honey, can I ask you
a question... Seriously?

616
00:40:27,859 --> 00:40:30,026
Are you happy?

617
00:40:30,028 --> 00:40:32,962
The color won't come out
of my hair.

618
00:40:32,964 --> 00:40:37,066
Foreclosure? Are you serious?

619
00:40:37,068 --> 00:40:40,670
<i>No, no, no. No. No, no, no, I didn't
mean that you weren't serious. No, no.</i>

620
00:40:40,672 --> 00:40:44,941
Leo... may I call you Leo?

621
00:40:44,943 --> 00:40:48,077
Mr. Schramm, I know that deadlines
are not meant to be ignored,

622
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:50,079
but please don't do
anything rash.

623
00:40:50,081 --> 00:40:53,216
The check will be in your hands
by 3:00 this afternoon.

624
00:40:53,218 --> 00:40:56,586
I swear to God,
I'll bring it myself.

625
00:40:56,588 --> 00:40:59,656
I'm ready to make a deal.

626
00:40:59,658 --> 00:41:01,491
<i>Veronica!</i>

627
00:41:01,493 --> 00:41:04,761
- Can I talk to you in private for a second?
- Yes.

628
00:41:04,763 --> 00:41:08,665
I knew you'd see it my way. Okay,
so how we're gonna play this...

629
00:41:08,667 --> 00:41:11,501
<i>don't give away</i>
<i>the merchandising!</i>

630
00:41:11,503 --> 00:41:13,503
<i>This is an
insult to anthropology.</i>

631
00:41:13,505 --> 00:41:15,572
<i>- That's right, an insult.
- This seems fine to me.</i>

632
00:41:15,574 --> 00:41:17,941
<i>James' style has always</i>
<i>been unconventional.</i>

633
00:41:17,943 --> 00:41:22,645
Uh, unconventional. Gerald, for God's
sake, this is tabloid anthropology.

634
00:41:22,647 --> 00:41:24,948
The shelmikedmu demi-bra?

635
00:41:24,950 --> 00:41:26,950
It's tabloid. You're jealous.

636
00:41:26,952 --> 00:41:30,186
Oh, you're ridiculous. I've never
been jealous of anyone in my life.

637
00:41:30,188 --> 00:41:35,725
Bullshit. The shelmikedmu have captured
the imagination of the public.

638
00:41:35,727 --> 00:41:39,896
<i>Unlike your musty old galincas.</i>

639
00:41:39,898 --> 00:41:44,634
<i>Which by comparison strike me as...
oh, what's that word? Boring.</i>

640
00:41:44,636 --> 00:41:48,938
Krippendorf is sensationalizing this
tribe for his own financial gain.

641
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:50,807
Oh, get a grip.

642
00:41:50,809 --> 00:41:53,042
<i>Professor, please,</i>
<i>just... please!</i>

643
00:41:53,044 --> 00:41:58,715
James' style may not be to your liking,
but miss micelli is absolutely right.

644
00:41:58,717 --> 00:42:02,218
<i>Thanks to krippendorf's tribe, this department's
reputation is growing by leaps and bounds,</i>

645
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:04,187
and I, for one, am delighted.

646
00:42:04,189 --> 00:42:06,623
Well, you may be falling
for this shelmikedmu crap,

647
00:42:06,625 --> 00:42:09,592
but every instinct in my body tells
me that this stinks to high heaven.

648
00:42:09,594 --> 00:42:11,961
- Excuse me, Ruth. - Mine too!
- Mine, too, Professor.

649
00:42:11,963 --> 00:42:14,697
In fact, I don't think
there is a shelmikedmu tribe.

650
00:42:14,699 --> 00:42:17,600
All right,
miss Professor know-it-all.

651
00:42:17,602 --> 00:42:21,170
If you're so sure there's no tribe, why don't
you take off to mount bosavi and prove it.

652
00:42:21,172 --> 00:42:23,706
- I should.
- That's right. She should.

653
00:42:23,708 --> 00:42:26,609
- Go ahead.
- I just might.

654
00:42:26,611 --> 00:42:29,979
- Be my guest.
- Hah! I will!

655
00:42:29,981 --> 00:42:34,317
Lori and I will leave tomorrow.
That's right, tomorrow.

656
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:38,187
We will? Ruth. Ruth!

657
00:42:38,189 --> 00:42:40,023
<i>[ Disco ]</i>

658
00:42:40,025 --> 00:42:42,325
<i>Boogie fever</i>

659
00:42:42,327 --> 00:42:45,261
you got to boogie down

660
00:42:47,032 --> 00:42:49,966
boogie fever

661
00:42:49,968 --> 00:42:52,602
I think it's goin' around¶

662
00:43:05,817 --> 00:43:07,884
Oh, my God, I'd forgotten.

663
00:43:07,886 --> 00:43:12,755
Oh, the decay, the stench.

664
00:43:12,757 --> 00:43:15,124
The chaos.

665
00:43:16,094 --> 00:43:20,763
Oh, popo, we're home.

666
00:43:20,765 --> 00:43:23,066
So much cleaner in the books.

667
00:43:23,068 --> 00:43:25,702
We'll go find someone
to take us where we're going.

668
00:43:25,704 --> 00:43:29,372
Lori, you look positively green.
You should eat something.

669
00:43:29,374 --> 00:43:31,608
Who wants to get work?

670
00:43:31,610 --> 00:43:35,878
You! Me like go long bosavi now.
No bosavi. No.

671
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:39,749
Me like buy 'em triple man.

672
00:43:39,751 --> 00:43:42,652
Go bosavi. <i> No bosavi.</i>

673
00:43:42,654 --> 00:43:44,654
<i>Not me! Not me!</i>

674
00:43:56,768 --> 00:43:59,335
You, me, go bosavi now.

675
00:44:11,049 --> 00:44:13,750
I-I'm fine, thank you.

676
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:17,253
<i>Now, for the shelmikedmu,</i>

677
00:44:17,255 --> 00:44:20,123
personal appearance
is of primary concern.

678
00:44:20,125 --> 00:44:23,760
And for the young people,
especially the teenagers,

679
00:44:23,762 --> 00:44:26,963
one second. These ritual obligations
are terribly painful and...

680
00:44:26,965 --> 00:44:29,232
<i>psst, psst, psst.</i>
And absolutely necessary.

681
00:44:29,234 --> 00:44:31,234
Excuse me. Pardon me.
Excuse me. Pardon me.

682
00:44:31,236 --> 00:44:34,737
It's random house.
They love us.

683
00:44:34,739 --> 00:44:36,773
Sit down!

684
00:44:38,777 --> 00:44:41,911
Um, the
rituals that I spoke about...

685
00:44:41,913 --> 00:44:45,915
Are performed in a small
and sacred shrine...

686
00:44:45,917 --> 00:44:50,186
Dad, Shelly's been
in the bathroom for an hour!

687
00:44:50,188 --> 00:44:52,155
<i>Located near the sleeping area.</i>

688
00:44:52,157 --> 00:44:57,026
<i>In the center of that shrine</i>
<i>is an altar affixed to a wall.</i>

689
00:44:57,028 --> 00:45:00,897
<i>Inside these altars are</i>
<i>various talismen and potions.</i>

690
00:45:00,899 --> 00:45:03,332
<i>Let me in!</i> I'm busy.

691
00:45:03,334 --> 00:45:06,069
<i>Much attention is paid</i>
<i>to the underarm,</i>

692
00:45:06,071 --> 00:45:09,739
<i>a sacred part</i>
<i>of the shelmikedmu anatomy.</i>

693
00:45:09,741 --> 00:45:13,076
<i>Good or bad fortune is believed</i>
<i>to emanate from this area.</i>

694
00:45:13,078 --> 00:45:15,978
<i>Oh, well.</i>

695
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:18,314
Any other...
any other questions?

696
00:45:18,316 --> 00:45:22,785
<i>Yes?</i> Do the shelmikedmu
practice divorce?

697
00:45:24,823 --> 00:45:29,826
Well, when a shelmikedmu couple
wish to divorce,

698
00:45:29,828 --> 00:45:34,864
the tribal equivalent of a lawyer is
appointed to each side in the marriage.

699
00:45:34,866 --> 00:45:38,868
Everybody concerned works very hard
to avoid an annulment from happening.

700
00:45:38,870 --> 00:45:44,107
However, if a divorce, in fact,
takes place,

701
00:45:44,109 --> 00:45:46,809
the two lawyers are executed.

702
00:45:46,811 --> 00:45:51,848
Yes! Yes! Yes!

703
00:45:51,850 --> 00:45:54,751
There's just so much we can
learn from the shelmikedmu,

704
00:45:54,753 --> 00:45:56,519
except for their hair
and makeup.

705
00:45:56,521 --> 00:45:58,821
Another brilliant lecture,
Professor.

706
00:45:58,823 --> 00:46:01,958
I am anxious to see what you come
up with for our sweeps week video.

707
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:04,827
Uh, sweeps week video?

708
00:46:04,829 --> 00:46:07,764
Yes, I paid you for it last week.
I need it by Monday.

709
00:46:07,766 --> 00:46:09,999
Ah, sweet potato.

710
00:46:10,001 --> 00:46:14,904
It examines the role of the sweet potato
in shelmikedmu agriculture. Sweet potato.

711
00:46:14,906 --> 00:46:16,939
<i>Boring. </i> What, boring?

712
00:46:16,941 --> 00:46:19,909
Well, let's speak frankly here.
We need ratings.

713
00:46:19,911 --> 00:46:22,879
Now, we have their attention, but
we need something that grabs focus.

714
00:46:22,881 --> 00:46:25,414
<i>Not sweet potatoes. Precisely.</i>

715
00:46:25,416 --> 00:46:28,818
Such as... sex.

716
00:46:30,855 --> 00:46:33,856
Shelmikedmu sex videos?

717
00:46:33,858 --> 00:46:38,828
Mating rituals, James. One of the
cornerstones of any field research.

718
00:46:38,830 --> 00:46:41,030
You did cover them, didn't you?

719
00:46:41,032 --> 00:46:43,065
Don't be ridiculous.

720
00:46:43,067 --> 00:46:46,068
Besides, no one is gonna wanna watch
the shelmikedmu do each other.

721
00:46:46,070 --> 00:46:48,271
Certainly not. How vulgar.

722
00:46:48,273 --> 00:46:50,273
Unless scientifically
presented, of course.

723
00:46:50,275 --> 00:46:52,341
Don't move.

724
00:46:52,343 --> 00:46:54,343
Excuse me, ladies.

725
00:46:54,345 --> 00:46:57,413
Would any of you be interested in
watching a one-hour special...

726
00:46:57,415 --> 00:46:59,882
On the mating rituals
of the shelmikedmu?

727
00:46:59,884 --> 00:47:02,885
You mean sex videos?
Oh, absolutely. Yes.

728
00:47:02,887 --> 00:47:05,955
Oh, very interested. What
night will it be on?

729
00:47:05,957 --> 00:47:08,524
Discovery channel,
eat your heart out.

730
00:47:08,526 --> 00:47:10,927
Loosen up, James.

731
00:47:13,064 --> 00:47:15,932
I think you're right.

732
00:47:15,934 --> 00:47:21,137
Would you like to discuss this
over a drink?

733
00:47:21,139 --> 00:47:23,472
Mm.

734
00:47:23,474 --> 00:47:27,877
¶The
shelmikedmu courting chant.

735
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:31,581
When a shelmikedmu male
wishes to woo a female,

736
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:37,086
<i>he breaks the ice with a drink of
fermented juteberries and banana sap.</i>

737
00:47:37,088 --> 00:47:39,422
Another Brandy,
Professor micelli?

738
00:47:39,424 --> 00:47:43,459
Oh, call me Veronica, please.

739
00:47:45,496 --> 00:47:48,865
I really don't think I should.

740
00:47:48,867 --> 00:47:51,968
No, a little more.

741
00:47:53,171 --> 00:47:55,238
Thank you.

742
00:47:59,444 --> 00:48:01,944
So...

743
00:48:01,946 --> 00:48:05,348
Are your children sleeping?

744
00:48:05,350 --> 00:48:08,384
They're spending the evening
at their grandparents'.

745
00:48:11,356 --> 00:48:13,456
Oh.

746
00:48:16,527 --> 00:48:18,594
Ahh.

747
00:48:21,399 --> 00:48:24,333
What's that? This?

748
00:48:24,335 --> 00:48:28,571
Oh! This is a<i> kiefo.</i>

749
00:48:28,573 --> 00:48:32,174
The shelmikedmu use it
when choosing a bride.

750
00:48:32,176 --> 00:48:35,077
Oh.

751
00:48:35,079 --> 00:48:37,113
How does it work?

752
00:48:37,115 --> 00:48:42,051
Well, uh, that's, uh,
very graphic.

753
00:48:42,053 --> 00:48:45,054
Please. Yes, okay.

754
00:48:45,056 --> 00:48:48,691
Um, just bear in mind that I'm
speaking to you as a scholar...

755
00:48:48,693 --> 00:48:54,096
And not as a man who finds
you unbelievably attractive.

756
00:48:54,098 --> 00:48:57,366
<i>The prospective</i>
<i>shelmikedmu bride...</i>

757
00:48:57,368 --> 00:49:02,405
Holds the<i> kiefo</i> thusly, allowing
her breasts to fall over the edge,

758
00:49:02,407 --> 00:49:05,441
<i>suggesting the possibility</i>
<i>of her fertility.</i>

759
00:49:05,443 --> 00:49:09,478
A sort of shelmikedmu
wet t-shirt contest.

760
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:11,981
Yeah.

761
00:49:11,983 --> 00:49:15,451
Now these lines here,
um, indicate...

762
00:49:15,453 --> 00:49:19,021
How large the breasts
might be...

763
00:49:19,023 --> 00:49:22,992
<i>And also determine payment.</i>

764
00:49:22,994 --> 00:49:25,061
One pig's worth, two pig's
worth, three pig's worth,

765
00:49:25,063 --> 00:49:28,531
and so on and so forth
and so on.

766
00:49:28,533 --> 00:49:31,067
Oh.

767
00:49:31,069 --> 00:49:34,103
Here, let me be
the shelmikedmu virgin.

768
00:49:42,246 --> 00:49:45,982
Ah. Ooh, there we go.

769
00:49:47,752 --> 00:49:50,720
How do I stack up?

770
00:49:50,722 --> 00:49:52,722
Um...

771
00:49:52,724 --> 00:49:56,425
well, as the shelmikedmu
would say,

772
00:49:56,427 --> 00:49:58,427
<i>jagabondo!</i>

773
00:49:58,429 --> 00:50:01,364
Which roughly
translates as, uh,

774
00:50:01,366 --> 00:50:05,067
more pigs than you can
possibly imagine.

775
00:50:05,069 --> 00:50:08,571
Wee-wee-wee, all the way home.

776
00:50:09,674 --> 00:50:13,342
Oh. What's this hole for?

777
00:50:13,344 --> 00:50:16,178
That hole...

778
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:19,148
By golly, I think you found
out what that hole is for.

779
00:50:19,150 --> 00:50:23,519
Extra credit
for Professor micelli.

780
00:50:23,521 --> 00:50:28,024
You know, I've always had
a crush on you.

781
00:50:28,026 --> 00:50:31,027
When I was in your seminar
on the kinaposa,

782
00:50:31,029 --> 00:50:36,032
you made me feel like I was
the only woman in the room.

783
00:50:36,034 --> 00:50:39,802
You<i> were</i> the only woman
in that room.

784
00:50:39,804 --> 00:50:42,471
Be honest. Are you attracted to me?
Uh-huh.

785
00:50:42,473 --> 00:50:46,175
Uh-huh. Are you just saying that
'cause I'm holding your penis?

786
00:50:48,579 --> 00:50:52,548
Would you like to slip in
to something more...

787
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:54,550
Comfortable?

788
00:50:54,552 --> 00:50:56,552
Mm-hmm.

789
00:51:26,584 --> 00:51:30,286
Ah, ah, ah.

790
00:51:30,288 --> 00:51:33,222
Ah, yeah, yeah.

791
00:51:37,295 --> 00:51:41,197
<i>I always wondered if all those months
in the jungle would change a man,</i>

792
00:51:41,199 --> 00:51:43,165
<i>but, James, I had no idea.</i>

793
00:51:45,169 --> 00:51:49,738
<i>You're a wild man. Come here.</i>

794
00:52:02,186 --> 00:52:07,189
<i>a-wimoweh, a-wimoweh
a-wimoweh, a-wimoweh</i>

795
00:52:09,227 --> 00:52:11,293
<i>Wimoweh.</i>

796
00:52:17,135 --> 00:52:19,168
Ooh.

797
00:52:48,366 --> 00:52:51,767
Last night was unbelievable.

798
00:52:54,338 --> 00:52:57,173
Mmm, yes, it was.

799
00:53:00,511 --> 00:53:05,381
So what are you gonna do today?
Um, let's see.

800
00:53:05,383 --> 00:53:07,416
Whatever you're doing.

801
00:53:07,418 --> 00:53:10,686
You know, it's never good
when couples work together,

802
00:53:10,688 --> 00:53:15,357
so I've decided that this
shelmikedmu thing is over.

803
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:17,326
Mm-hmm.

804
00:53:17,328 --> 00:53:19,929
I'm gonna take a shower.

805
00:53:19,931 --> 00:53:21,964
Okay.

806
00:53:32,777 --> 00:53:36,512
What do you mean, this
shelmikedmu thing is over?

807
00:53:36,514 --> 00:53:40,382
We just can't invade these innocent people's
lives any more than we already have.

808
00:53:40,384 --> 00:53:42,651
Why not? Why? Because
it's not right.

809
00:53:42,653 --> 00:53:45,254
Well, well, what was
last night about then?

810
00:53:45,256 --> 00:53:48,891
Are you saying that last night happened only
because you want to become a partner...

811
00:53:48,893 --> 00:53:51,727
<i>In the shelmikedmu?</i>

812
00:53:51,728 --> 00:53:54,562
No! What I am saying is, I
thought that we... that wh...

813
00:53:54,565 --> 00:53:58,334
goddamn it, where is my shoe?

814
00:53:58,336 --> 00:54:02,805
You know what? I worked my butt off to
make shelmikedmu the talk of anthropology.

815
00:54:02,807 --> 00:54:04,807
Who asked you?

816
00:54:04,809 --> 00:54:08,377
Oh, find yourself a genius.

817
00:54:08,379 --> 00:54:10,379
Gordon. James.

818
00:54:10,381 --> 00:54:12,414
Can we talk? Um...

819
00:54:12,416 --> 00:54:15,417
as you know, Irene believes the
children belong in Chester hills,

820
00:54:15,419 --> 00:54:17,419
but, really, all she needs
is assurance...

821
00:54:17,421 --> 00:54:20,889
That the children are being raised in
a decent and sanitary environment.

822
00:54:20,891 --> 00:54:25,561
<i>You are an egomaniacal monster. Do you know that?
</i> I'm at the front door.

823
00:54:25,563 --> 00:54:27,630
Who's that? My new housekeeper.

824
00:54:27,632 --> 00:54:30,799
Housekeeper!

825
00:54:30,801 --> 00:54:34,536
<i>Housekeep this!</i>

826
00:54:34,538 --> 00:54:38,440
Don't worry about the ironing, miss micelli.
Have a nice day off.

827
00:54:38,442 --> 00:54:40,509
Would you like some coffee?
What's going on here?

828
00:54:40,511 --> 00:54:44,313
Out of this house.

829
00:54:44,315 --> 00:54:46,715
The old school
type of housekeeper.

830
00:54:46,717 --> 00:54:50,486
<i>Runs this house any way she wants, and
God help the person who gets in her way.</i>

831
00:54:50,488 --> 00:54:52,821
Uh, Tuesday, as usual?

832
00:54:52,823 --> 00:54:55,324
Kiss my neolithic ass!

833
00:54:57,495 --> 00:55:01,497
A proud woman. I try to be
sensitive to her feelings.

834
00:55:05,002 --> 00:55:07,770
You forgot your goat,
miss micelli.

835
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:14,343
Hurry up. Lick, lick.
We're almost up on top.

836
00:55:14,345 --> 00:55:17,680
Hurry up! You must hurry up!

837
00:55:19,750 --> 00:55:22,518
Day three.
Despite my best efforts,

838
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:25,721
the mood of the expedition has
turned against me...

839
00:55:25,723 --> 00:55:31,460
And heavy weather threatens to delay
us even-even more... more than...

840
00:55:31,462 --> 00:55:34,630
my God, that has got to be the
greatest ass I've ever seen on a man.

841
00:55:34,632 --> 00:55:37,032
<i>Ole,</i> man.

842
00:55:37,034 --> 00:55:39,101
What's wrong?

843
00:55:44,575 --> 00:55:46,809
What's wrong? No bosavi.

844
00:55:46,811 --> 00:55:48,877
Yes, bosavi. Make way! Go!

845
00:55:51,816 --> 00:55:56,618
You can talk to me. What's the
deal with this bosavi thing?

846
00:55:56,620 --> 00:55:59,088
Too dangerous?
Too sacred? What?

847
00:55:59,090 --> 00:56:02,124
No. Too far uphill.

848
00:56:06,831 --> 00:56:10,632
Give me that!

849
00:56:10,634 --> 00:56:12,634
Woman knows
how to cut the bush.

850
00:56:12,636 --> 00:56:15,437
Die, krippendorf!
Lying, cheating...

851
00:56:15,439 --> 00:56:19,108
- oh, man, you go.
- Aaah! Aaah!

852
00:56:19,110 --> 00:56:23,645
Lick, lick! <i>Krippendorf!
Aaah! Aaah! Aaah!</i>

853
00:56:32,490 --> 00:56:37,092
The shelmikedmu<i> utabaji</i> embraces his
death with courage and dignity.

854
00:56:37,094 --> 00:56:41,130
Ohh! Ahh. All right,
let's get this show on the road.

855
00:56:41,132 --> 00:56:44,133
I still don't understand
why we have to kill him.

856
00:56:44,135 --> 00:56:47,469
I told you... so we can get rid
of this "shelmikedmu" crap.

857
00:56:47,471 --> 00:56:50,506
<i>I got a better idea. The shelmikedmu
family could celebrate the harvest.</i>

858
00:56:50,508 --> 00:56:52,574
Nah! Come on, Mickey. Let's go.

859
00:56:54,478 --> 00:56:58,480
Okay. Ready for my sweet
potato, Mr. Demille.

860
00:56:59,483 --> 00:57:01,417
<i>Okay, action.</i>

861
00:57:01,419 --> 00:57:04,486
- God, you are pathetic.
- What?

862
00:57:04,488 --> 00:57:07,623
- You said you weren't doing any more of these.
- Oh, give me a break.

863
00:57:07,625 --> 00:57:09,725
I'm dyin' with dignity
out here.

864
00:57:09,727 --> 00:57:12,795
Why don't you try living with some?
I mean, what's next?

865
00:57:12,797 --> 00:57:16,198
<i>Gee, let's see. Well, we've had
the backyard circumcision.</i>

866
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:19,568
We've danced with the pigs
to ensure my fertility.

867
00:57:19,570 --> 00:57:21,670
That one really
changed my life.

868
00:57:21,672 --> 00:57:23,939
So, what's the next step?
Cannibalism?

869
00:57:23,941 --> 00:57:27,443
Hey, Mrs. O'Brian, are you doing
anything tonight? Oh! Shit!

870
00:57:27,445 --> 00:57:30,479
We're having a barbecue.
Wear some hot sauce.

871
00:57:30,481 --> 00:57:32,214
Will you keep it down!

872
00:57:32,216 --> 00:57:35,584
Listen to you, Ms. High and mighty,
too busy to help your family.

873
00:57:35,586 --> 00:57:39,087
That's such bullshit, and it doesn't
change the fact that you're a liar.

874
00:57:39,089 --> 00:57:41,623
I had to lie! Not
to me, you didn't.

875
00:57:41,625 --> 00:57:44,660
Every time you do one of
these, "it's the last one."

876
00:57:44,662 --> 00:57:46,662
This<i> is</i> the last one.

877
00:57:46,664 --> 00:57:50,833
Shelly, why do you think I'm dressed this way?
I'm killing the<i> utabaji.</i>

878
00:57:52,069 --> 00:57:54,169
You are? <i>Yes!</i>

879
00:57:54,171 --> 00:57:59,208
After this, it's over. I'm killing
the son of a bitch and burying him.

880
00:57:59,210 --> 00:58:01,677
When? Now.

881
00:58:01,679 --> 00:58:04,513
And after this,
it's back to normal.

882
00:58:07,551 --> 00:58:10,118
"Normal."

883
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:19,061
Who is that?

884
00:58:24,068 --> 00:58:26,034
That's it!

885
00:58:26,036 --> 00:58:29,705
Porter and Adams saw me. We're dead!

886
00:58:29,707 --> 00:58:32,207
Dad. Dad!

887
00:58:32,209 --> 00:58:34,209
Dad! What?

888
00:58:34,211 --> 00:58:36,645
They don't know it's you.

889
00:58:36,647 --> 00:58:38,747
Perfect.

890
00:58:38,749 --> 00:58:42,718
Edmund, go outside
and hide in the hut.

891
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:45,687
Mickey, go to the door.

892
00:58:48,659 --> 00:58:50,893
Dean Adams. Come in. Thank you.

893
00:58:50,895 --> 00:58:52,961
Who... what... what was that?

894
00:58:52,963 --> 00:58:55,597
We just saw the strangest thing.
Uh... uh, that?

895
00:58:55,599 --> 00:58:58,767
Well, my father wanted to
surprise you, but, uh...

896
00:58:58,769 --> 00:59:01,103
he brought one of the
shelmikedmu here to America.

897
00:59:01,105 --> 00:59:03,105
Oh, this is marvelous.
Unbelievable.

898
00:59:03,107 --> 00:59:06,074
Are you serious? Are you serious?
This is incredible!

899
00:59:06,076 --> 00:59:08,110
<i>Gerald?</i> Yes, James?

900
00:59:08,112 --> 00:59:10,612
<i>Who's that with you?
</i> President Porter, James.

901
00:59:10,614 --> 00:59:13,048
<i>I'm so upset.</i>
<i>You spoiled my surprise.</i>

902
00:59:13,050 --> 00:59:16,084
You have outdone
yourself, James.

903
00:59:16,086 --> 00:59:19,054
I came here this afternoon...

904
00:59:19,056 --> 00:59:22,758
To talk you into extending your
lecture series, Professor,

905
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:24,760
but I never imagined this.

906
00:59:24,762 --> 00:59:28,830
- Who could?
- So, bring him out. I want to meet him.

907
00:59:30,768 --> 00:59:33,302
I would, but, uh, he's praying.

908
00:59:33,304 --> 00:59:35,270
Yeah, uh, just one...
one, uh...

909
00:59:39,577 --> 00:59:41,643
Oh. Yeah. Excuse me.

910
00:59:43,180 --> 00:59:46,214
Did you know
he was planning this?

911
00:59:46,216 --> 00:59:48,216
Yes. Yes, yes, I did.

912
00:59:50,854 --> 00:59:53,088
May I use the phone? Sure.

913
00:59:59,797 --> 01:00:02,798
<i>He's got
an incredible sense of humor.</i>

914
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:05,834
- How long is he here for?
- Uh, just a little while.

915
01:00:05,836 --> 01:00:07,869
Um, he's on a super saver.

916
01:00:07,871 --> 01:00:09,871
I'd like him to meet
a friend of mine.

917
01:00:09,873 --> 01:00:13,742
Oh, I... I'd like that, but I don't
think it's gonna be, uh, possible.

918
01:00:13,744 --> 01:00:16,745
Y-you see, he has to get back for, uh...
for<i> shelriku.</i>

919
01:00:16,747 --> 01:00:19,748
Yes! That's right. He has
to get back for<i> shelriku.</i>

920
01:00:19,750 --> 01:00:22,718
<i>Uh... uh...</i>
<i>the sweet potato harvest.</i>

921
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:25,754
The sweet potato har...
God, that is right!

922
01:00:25,756 --> 01:00:27,756
Excellent. Excellent.
That's right.

923
01:00:27,758 --> 01:00:30,759
Has the sweet potato harvest
come so quickly again?

924
01:00:30,761 --> 01:00:33,328
Gosh, only 28 more cropping
days till<i> shelriku.</i>

925
01:00:33,330 --> 01:00:35,263
<i>Hold on. It's my nephew.</i>

926
01:00:35,265 --> 01:00:38,100
He books talent for a talk
show, and he loves the idea.

927
01:00:38,102 --> 01:00:41,136
- Excellent!
- Talk show? Oh, I don't think so.

928
01:00:41,138 --> 01:00:43,739
- No, no, he's got a, uh...
- No. <i> Yes.</i>

929
01:00:43,741 --> 01:00:45,774
No, no. No. Yes!

930
01:00:45,776 --> 01:00:49,077
Tomorrow it is, then. It's settled.
Congratulations, James.

931
01:00:49,079 --> 01:00:52,147
Oh, don't you think the alumni association...
This is the most exciting...

932
01:00:59,023 --> 01:01:02,724
<i>wishbone
world's most colorful face</i>

933
01:01:02,726 --> 01:01:05,727
<i>[ Monkey screeching ]</i>

934
01:01:05,729 --> 01:01:08,830
<i>Good evening, and welcome
to another episode of...</i>

935
01:01:08,832 --> 01:01:10,732
<i>Life of the shelmikedmu.</i>

936
01:01:10,734 --> 01:01:13,802
<i>Tonight we are airing</i>
<i>a very special...</i>

937
01:01:13,804 --> 01:01:16,405
<i>And perhaps</i>
<i>controversial aspect...</i>

938
01:01:16,407 --> 01:01:19,074
Of Professor krippendorf's
unique tribe:

939
01:01:19,076 --> 01:01:22,778
The mating rituals
of the shelmikedmu.

940
01:01:22,780 --> 01:01:24,780
<i>I feel obliged to clarify...</i>

941
01:01:24,782 --> 01:01:26,782
For the viewer...

942
01:01:26,784 --> 01:01:28,784
That the material
presented tonight,

943
01:01:28,786 --> 01:01:30,919
offensive as it may be
for some...

944
01:01:30,921 --> 01:01:33,922
And inappropriate as it may be
for children,

945
01:01:33,924 --> 01:01:36,925
is offered as
scientific research.

946
01:01:36,927 --> 01:01:40,762
And now, sit back and enjoy.

947
01:01:40,764 --> 01:01:43,765
The marriage of
a shelmikedmu male and female...

948
01:01:43,767 --> 01:01:48,904
Is consummated in the relative privacy
of the<i> penumana,</i> or matrimonial hut.

949
01:01:48,906 --> 01:01:51,440
<i>Keeping to centuries</i>
<i>of tradition,</i>

950
01:01:51,442 --> 01:01:53,709
the villagers
wait outside the hut,

951
01:01:53,711 --> 01:01:56,712
singing and hoping for
a successful and fertile union.

952
01:01:56,714 --> 01:01:58,346
<i>Ho-ho!</i>

953
01:01:58,348 --> 01:02:00,348
After years
of domestic drudgery...

954
01:02:00,350 --> 01:02:04,052
The young bride takes advantage
of this rare chance to let loose,

955
01:02:04,054 --> 01:02:08,857
acting in a way that, to the untrained
Western eye, might appear as drunkenness.

956
01:02:08,859 --> 01:02:10,959
<i>Go, baby!</i>

957
01:02:10,961 --> 01:02:12,794
<i>Wild jungle woman.</i>

958
01:02:12,796 --> 01:02:16,231
That's what I like. <i> This is gettin' good!</i>

959
01:02:16,233 --> 01:02:18,166
I'd do her.

960
01:02:19,236 --> 01:02:21,737
Oww! <i>Ha ha! Look at this!</i>

961
01:02:21,739 --> 01:02:24,740
What'd you do that for?
I wasn't talkin' about you.

962
01:02:24,742 --> 01:02:28,877
<i>Life of the shelmikedmu</i> will be back in a moment.
<i>Shake it, baby! Shake it!</i>

963
01:02:28,879 --> 01:02:32,380
<i>Everybody wants to be on</i>
<i>the</i> Larry swift show,<i> James.</i>

964
01:02:32,382 --> 01:02:34,382
<i>It's a great honor,</i>
<i>I know, but...</i>

965
01:02:34,384 --> 01:02:36,885
<i>look, Simon, I need you</i>
<i>to do this for me.</i>

966
01:02:36,887 --> 01:02:38,820
<i>But the shelmikedmu,</i>
<i>that's your baby.</i>

967
01:02:38,822 --> 01:02:41,857
<i>Why don't you appear</i>
<i>on the show yourself?</i>

968
01:02:41,859 --> 01:02:45,227
I would, but I told you I have to
fly home for my brother's funeral.

969
01:02:45,229 --> 01:02:48,764
But I'm concerned, James. I do not
speak shelmikedmu. You'll be fine.

970
01:02:48,766 --> 01:02:51,933
Just follow the notes. Look, I'm
gonna be late for my flight.

971
01:02:51,935 --> 01:02:54,970
The<i> utabaji's</i> gonna be here any second.
You're gonna be okay.

972
01:02:54,972 --> 01:02:58,874
Go, go, go. I'm going to do this for you.
It will be an honor.

973
01:02:58,876 --> 01:03:02,844
I'm ashamed I supported Ruth when she
left for new Guinea to discredit you.

974
01:03:03,947 --> 01:03:06,314
When was that? Last Tuesday.

975
01:03:08,852 --> 01:03:11,820
And now back
to the<i> Larry swift show.</i>

976
01:03:11,822 --> 01:03:13,855
Camera two. Welcome back.

977
01:03:13,857 --> 01:03:17,259
We're here discussing the amazing
discovery of Dr. James krippendorf.

978
01:03:17,261 --> 01:03:20,262
Unfortunately, a death in his family
means he couldn't be here tonight,

979
01:03:20,264 --> 01:03:22,898
but we have the help of his
colleague Simon Alonso.

980
01:03:22,900 --> 01:03:24,900
Hello, Simon. Hello, Larry.

981
01:03:24,902 --> 01:03:26,902
And welcome, chief kawanakapi.

982
01:03:29,039 --> 01:03:31,940
A traditional
shelmikedmu greeting.

983
01:03:31,942 --> 01:03:34,176
Oh. <i> Hamass! Hamamass!</i>

984
01:03:34,178 --> 01:03:36,978
They must go through quite a few
tables where he comes from.

985
01:03:40,551 --> 01:03:43,885
<i>Uh, what is he saying, Simon?
</i> Um...

986
01:03:43,887 --> 01:03:48,190
You know, Larry, I...
Larry, I...

987
01:03:48,192 --> 01:03:51,893
wait a second.
My producer is telling me...

988
01:03:51,895 --> 01:03:54,963
oh, we have found an expert, someone
who is fluent in shelmikedmu.

989
01:03:54,965 --> 01:03:57,966
- You did?
<i>- Yes, and here she is now.</i>

990
01:03:57,968 --> 01:04:01,069
<i>Professor Veronica micelli, a colleague
of yours at bounderbee university.</i>

991
01:04:01,071 --> 01:04:03,071
Hi, Professor micelli.
Shelmikedmu.

992
01:04:03,073 --> 01:04:05,373
Shelmikedmu. Hi. Nice
to see you, Alonso.

993
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:08,009
You can go. Uh, no, I promised prof.
Krippendorf...

994
01:04:08,011 --> 01:04:09,978
go!

995
01:04:09,980 --> 01:04:12,013
I have to go, Larry.

996
01:04:14,017 --> 01:04:15,984
Professor, you're an authority
on the shelmikedmu?

997
01:04:15,986 --> 01:04:18,971
That's right, Larry.

998
01:04:18,972 --> 01:04:21,957
Actually, in anthropological circles I have done
everything but replace prof. Krippendorf...

999
01:04:21,959 --> 01:04:24,125
As<i> the</i> expert
on the shelmikedmu.

1000
01:04:24,127 --> 01:04:28,563
Not to take anything away from his studies,
of course, as inconclusive as they are.

1001
01:04:29,967 --> 01:04:32,934
Now the shit-ah
hit-ah da fan-ah.

1002
01:04:35,372 --> 01:04:37,205
<i>Could you ask the chief his initial
impressions of the United States?</i>

1003
01:04:37,207 --> 01:04:39,241
Oh, sure. Uh...

1004
01:04:43,013 --> 01:04:44,980
You-ah...

1005
01:04:44,982 --> 01:04:46,514
Bitch.

1006
01:04:46,516 --> 01:04:48,183
Mmm.

1007
01:04:48,185 --> 01:04:51,186
He says it's a very large
and frightening country,

1008
01:04:51,188 --> 01:04:55,123
full of things he thought
existed only in myth.

1009
01:04:55,125 --> 01:04:59,094
And he said that in only three syllables?
It's a very concise language.

1010
01:04:59,096 --> 01:05:03,198
Sadly, this is the chief's
final appearance in America.

1011
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:05,233
He flies home tonight.

1012
01:05:05,235 --> 01:05:08,103
<i>Well, that makes this visit</i>
<i>very special indeed.</i>

1013
01:05:08,105 --> 01:05:12,040
Could you please explain his
costume for us? Gladly.

1014
01:05:12,042 --> 01:05:17,012
I guess the most obvious ornament to the
Western eye would be this penis sheath.

1015
01:05:17,014 --> 01:05:21,316
Um, its intention is to
intimidate opposing tribes.

1016
01:05:21,318 --> 01:05:25,654
Now, interestingly,
my research has proven...

1017
01:05:25,656 --> 01:05:30,458
That the size of the man's
sheath is in direct contrast...

1018
01:05:30,460 --> 01:05:32,527
To the size of...

1019
01:05:33,630 --> 01:05:36,031
let's just say,
the bigger the sheath...

1020
01:05:36,033 --> 01:05:38,033
The smaller the... obviously.

1021
01:05:38,035 --> 01:05:39,935
<i>Now, Professor,</i>

1022
01:05:39,937 --> 01:05:42,003
what is the chief doing now?

1023
01:05:44,007 --> 01:05:46,308
This would be a sign
of affection...

1024
01:05:46,310 --> 01:05:48,944
Amongst the shelmikedmu.

1025
01:05:48,946 --> 01:05:51,947
- Pretty much the same thing we do here.
- Uh-huh.

1026
01:05:51,949 --> 01:05:55,417
Now, this act of the chief calls for
the requisite response from the woman.

1027
01:05:55,419 --> 01:05:57,419
Aaaah!

1028
01:05:57,421 --> 01:06:00,088
¶¶

1029
01:06:00,090 --> 01:06:03,959
So, uh, I know this may seem
violent to the viewers,

1030
01:06:03,961 --> 01:06:06,995
but I can assure you the
chief is very used to this.

1031
01:06:06,997 --> 01:06:10,132
Or, at least, he should be.

1032
01:06:10,133 --> 01:06:13,268
Now, after such a display of affection it is
very common to give an offering of gifts.

1033
01:06:13,270 --> 01:06:16,304
Just so happen to have
some gifts right here.

1034
01:06:16,306 --> 01:06:18,273
What have you got there,
Professor?

1035
01:06:18,275 --> 01:06:21,309
Well, right here
I have a lovely selection...

1036
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:23,311
Of stink slugs and sego grubs.

1037
01:06:23,313 --> 01:06:27,048
It's a delicacy
for the shelmikedmu.

1038
01:06:29,086 --> 01:06:32,087
Ah, see. He's like
a kid in a candy store.

1039
01:06:32,089 --> 01:06:35,490
- He would like to know, can he eat one right here?
- Oh, of course he can.

1040
01:06:35,492 --> 01:06:38,426
I'll just get a nice, big, slimy one.
It'll fly right down.

1041
01:06:38,428 --> 01:06:42,197
Let's see here. Okay.

1042
01:06:42,199 --> 01:06:45,700
Here we go. <i>Can we get
a close-up of that?</i>

1043
01:06:45,702 --> 01:06:47,669
Sure! Camera one.

1044
01:06:50,073 --> 01:06:53,408
He says he can't wait to eat it.
<i>Oh, be my guest.</i>

1045
01:06:53,410 --> 01:06:55,410
All right.

1046
01:06:55,412 --> 01:06:58,580
Down-dah hatch-ah.
Eat-ah, puke-ah.

1047
01:07:09,226 --> 01:07:11,092
Fascinating, isn't it?

1048
01:07:25,642 --> 01:07:28,676
And the part where you slapped each other?
That was so rad.

1049
01:07:28,678 --> 01:07:31,179
Oh, yeah.
I enjoyed that part too.

1050
01:07:31,181 --> 01:07:33,181
See ya.

1051
01:07:33,183 --> 01:07:36,051
Are you out of your mind?

1052
01:07:36,053 --> 01:07:38,420
What? Out of<i> my</i> mind?

1053
01:07:40,157 --> 01:07:44,426
You lied to everyone. You falsified research.
You misappropriated grant money.

1054
01:07:44,428 --> 01:07:47,128
Is there anything
you haven't done?

1055
01:07:47,130 --> 01:07:49,264
No... hey!

1056
01:07:49,266 --> 01:07:51,666
Let me see. Eating a grub
on national television.

1057
01:07:51,668 --> 01:07:53,768
That about wraps it up

When did you figure this out?

1062
01:08:01,545 --> 01:08:05,847
Oh, gee, let me see. Maybe when I saw
the wall of sex at the TV store.

1063

They did everything
but sell popcorn!

01:08:35,545 --> 01:08:38,480
Why did you tell Larry

1208
01:16:30,954 --> 01:16:32,987
Stop krippendorf."

1209
01:16:32,989 --> 01:16:35,022
You bet I will.

1210
01:16:36,059 --> 01:16:39,260
You made me lie to Larry swift!

1211
01:16:54,377 --> 01:16:56,611
All clear!

1212
01:16:58,281 --> 01:17:00,281
Help me. Keep breathing.

1213
01:17:00,283 --> 01:17:02,316
Oww!

1214
01:17:03,720 --> 01:17:05,786
I thought you were gonna
stay the<i> utabaji...</i>

1215
01:17:05,788 --> 01:17:07,788
<i>Until at least the main course.</i>

1216
01:17:07,790 --> 01:17:11,692
How was I supposed to know Mrs. Proxmire
was gonna be so hot to talk to me?

1217
01:17:11,694 --> 01:17:14,295
How did I ever get into this?

1218
01:17:14,297 --> 01:17:16,998
¶¶

1219
01:17:26,309 --> 01:17:28,275
You are actually enjoying
this, aren't you?

1220
01:17:28,277 --> 01:17:30,211
Mm-hmm.

1221
01:17:47,964 --> 01:17:52,400
Hi. I am a colleague of your
father from the university.

1222
01:17:52,402 --> 01:17:55,870
What do you want? Uh, I,
uh, I am Professor Alonso.

1223
01:17:55,872 --> 01:17:58,939
Perhaps you have seen me
on the<i> Larry swift show?</i>

1224
01:17:59,942 --> 01:18:02,109
Your father
asked me to come by...

1225
01:18:02,111 --> 01:18:05,846
And pick up all the shelmikedmu
research material.

1226
01:18:05,848 --> 01:18:08,015
Why?

1227
01:18:08,017 --> 01:18:12,253
Why? Because he wants to
show it at the gala tonight.

1228
01:18:12,255 --> 01:18:14,055
You'll have to
come back tomorrow.

1229
01:18:14,057 --> 01:18:16,090
<i>No!</i>

1230
01:18:16,092 --> 01:18:18,059
We need it tonight.
Please. Please!

1231
01:18:18,061 --> 01:18:21,295
I am good with children.
Please listen to me.

1232
01:18:21,297 --> 01:18:23,297
Please open up. Please!

1233
01:18:26,368 --> 01:18:29,436
Oh, you think that's funny? You wait till
Ruth Allen comes back from new Guinea!

1234
01:18:29,439 --> 01:18:31,872
I'll show you
who's going to laugh last!

1235
01:18:31,874 --> 01:18:33,407
Shelly!

1236
01:18:33,409 --> 01:18:35,843
Oh, I hate children!

1237
01:18:38,014 --> 01:18:40,915
<i>They know.</i>
Don't you ever knock?

1238
01:18:40,917 --> 01:18:44,051
They know there's no shelmikedmu.
We have to tell dad.

1239
01:18:49,459 --> 01:18:51,759
I'm driving.

1240
01:18:51,761 --> 01:18:54,261
You? You drive?

1241
01:18:54,263 --> 01:18:57,298
For your approval, sir. <i>¶¶</i>

1242
01:18:57,300 --> 01:19:00,835
<i>So he says, "that goes for
your cat too."</i>

1243
01:19:04,474 --> 01:19:06,474
Are you a nursing mother?

1244
01:19:08,444 --> 01:19:10,478
Mmm!

1245
01:19:13,249 --> 01:19:16,250
You know, did I say "Happy
Birthday" to you yet?

1246
01:19:16,252 --> 01:19:18,786
Happy Birthday, Edith.

1247
01:19:20,056 --> 01:19:23,057
May I call you Edith?
God, what a gorgeous ring.

1248
01:19:23,059 --> 01:19:27,128
<i>I've been meaning to talk to
you about the timototta tribe.</i>

1249
01:19:27,130 --> 01:19:30,831
<i>Because people are gonna start
getting bored with the shelmikedmu.</i>

1250
01:19:30,833 --> 01:19:33,000
So, we'll talk. Okay, good.

1251
01:19:34,937 --> 01:19:36,937
So, must be something
very important...

1252
01:19:36,939 --> 01:19:39,940
To keep your wife from attending
this honor for your son-in-law.

1253
01:19:39,942 --> 01:19:42,943
Yeah. She hadda defrost
the refrigerator.

1254
01:19:42,945 --> 01:19:45,212
Aah!

1255
01:19:45,214 --> 01:19:48,015
<i>Oh, for God's sake... I'm terribly sorry.</i>

1256
01:19:48,017 --> 01:19:50,451
Krippendorf.

1257
01:19:50,453 --> 01:19:53,521
<i>Where is he? It's almost time for
the presentation of the check...</i>

1258
01:19:53,523 --> 01:19:55,523
<i>And he's not here.</i>

1259
01:19:55,525 --> 01:19:57,925
Oh... kay. I'll find him.

1260
01:19:58,895 --> 01:20:00,895
Chief?

1261
01:20:00,897 --> 01:20:03,798
<i>Hamamass!</i>

1262
01:20:03,800 --> 01:20:07,134
He says he'll
miss you, but we'll be back.

1263
01:20:10,406 --> 01:20:14,875
Okay. God, Porter reminds me of
my cranky first-grade teacher.

1264
01:20:17,914 --> 01:20:19,446
Penis. Oh.

1265
01:20:21,484 --> 01:20:24,985
Okay, I am only gonna dress like the
<i>utabaji</i> until we get that check.

1266
01:20:24,987 --> 01:20:27,988
All right, all right. I'm
just letting you know.

1267
01:20:27,990 --> 01:20:30,925
Would you hurry up? I'm not that excited.

1268
01:20:30,927 --> 01:20:33,928
Self-obsessed person
I have ever met in my life.

1269
01:20:33,930 --> 01:20:37,832
I can't believe you. "I, I, I. Me,
me, me." <i>Oh, would you stop it?</i>

1270
01:20:37,834 --> 01:20:41,869
<i>You wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for me.
You're the one who wanted...</i>

1271
01:20:53,549 --> 01:20:55,549
Oh, God! Aaaah!

1272
01:20:58,554 --> 01:21:01,088
Mrs. Proxmire, this is
not what it looks like.

1273
01:21:01,090 --> 01:21:04,491
<i>Listen, we're just...</i>

1274
01:21:04,493 --> 01:21:07,494
are you all right? Of course she's not.
She's turning blue!

1275
01:21:07,496 --> 01:21:11,198
Do something!

1276
01:21:15,071 --> 01:21:19,039
<i>Ohh. Oh, good.</i>
<i>You saved her life.</i>

1277
01:21:20,443 --> 01:21:23,644
Ah-ah! No bell. No bell.

1278
01:21:23,646 --> 01:21:25,512
- Shh!
- No bell, please!

1279
01:21:25,514 --> 01:21:28,315
No bell! No bell!

1280
01:21:32,021 --> 01:21:35,990
My God, you killed her. I didn't kill her.
Are you crazy?

1281
01:21:35,992 --> 01:21:39,059
Don't be silly. Mrs. Proxmire!
Look how happy she...

1282
01:21:39,061 --> 01:21:41,095
<i>- no, no. Mrs. Proxmire!</i>
- Huh?

1283
01:21:41,097 --> 01:21:43,664
- Hello! Hello! Mrs... oh, look at that.
<i>- Mrs. Proxmire!</i>

1284
01:21:43,666 --> 01:21:46,000
Oh, shit!

1285
01:21:47,904 --> 01:21:51,071
Get dressed. Give me my penis
and I'll meet you downstairs.

1286
01:21:51,073 --> 01:21:53,140
<i>Mrs. Proxmire,
are you all right?</i>

1287
01:21:54,977 --> 01:21:57,544
- What'll I say to president Porter?
- You'll think of something.

1288
01:22:08,157 --> 01:22:10,057
<i>Hey!</i> Whoa.

1289
01:22:10,059 --> 01:22:11,659
<i>Ohhh.</i>

1290
01:22:11,661 --> 01:22:13,627
What's goin' on in here?

1291
01:22:42,325 --> 01:22:44,024
Mmm.

1292
01:22:49,398 --> 01:22:53,133
A-wimoweh, a-wimoweh,
a-wimoweh...

1293
01:22:53,135 --> 01:22:56,570
Get outta my way, you moron.

1294
01:22:56,572 --> 01:22:59,073
I thought you said dad
taught you to drive.

1295
01:22:59,075 --> 01:23:01,141
This<i> is</i> how he taught me!

1296
01:23:01,143 --> 01:23:03,177
What's happening?
There's no answer.

1297
01:23:03,179 --> 01:23:05,679
Keep tryin'. Wait, wait, wait.
Somebody picked up. Hello?

1298
01:23:05,681 --> 01:23:07,681
Is it him? Hello?

1299
01:23:07,683 --> 01:23:11,285
Hello? Papa sulukim?
Can you hear me?

1300
01:23:11,287 --> 01:23:14,989
Ladies and gentlemen,
please take your seats.

1301
01:23:14,991 --> 01:23:17,658
Thank you. Thank you.

1302
01:23:17,660 --> 01:23:21,061
Now it's time for the
presentation of the check...

1303
01:23:21,063 --> 01:23:23,998
To Professor... Krippendorf?

1304
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:28,435
Yeah, he had to leave because, um...
well, just because.

1305
01:23:28,437 --> 01:23:30,371
And he said
that as his partner...

1306
01:23:30,373 --> 01:23:33,407
I could accept the check
in his name.

1307
01:23:33,409 --> 01:23:36,276
Very well, Ms. Micelli.

1308
01:23:36,278 --> 01:23:38,479
And now, ladies and gentlemen,

1309
01:23:38,481 --> 01:23:41,248
let's have a warm greeting...

1310
01:23:41,250 --> 01:23:45,285
<i>For our shelmikedmu</i> utabaji.

1311
01:23:46,789 --> 01:23:49,089
Chief, that's for you.
Go on up.

1312
01:23:50,226 --> 01:23:52,092
<i>Hamamass!</i>

1313
01:23:52,094 --> 01:23:54,261
<i>Hamamass!</i>

1314
01:24:00,169 --> 01:24:05,606
Ms. Micelli, in recognition
of the remarkable research...

1315
01:24:05,608 --> 01:24:07,775
That prof. Krippendorf...

1316
01:24:07,777 --> 01:24:10,210
and, apparently, you...
have accomplished,

1317
01:24:10,212 --> 01:24:14,681
<i>Mrs. Proxmire</i>
<i>is proud to present you...</i>

1318
01:24:14,683 --> 01:24:18,152
With a check for $100,000...

1319
01:24:18,154 --> 01:24:21,622
To further your work
on the shelmikedmu people.

1320
01:24:21,624 --> 01:24:23,090
Wonderful.

1321
01:24:24,360 --> 01:24:27,528
Oh, thank you, Mrs. Proxmire.

1322
01:24:27,530 --> 01:24:30,097
Thank you very much.

1323
01:24:30,099 --> 01:24:32,166
It's so profoundly
generous of you.

1324
01:24:35,271 --> 01:24:37,271
Oh, my God.

1325
01:24:37,273 --> 01:24:39,239
Thank you.

1326
01:24:39,241 --> 01:24:42,409
Well, as a girl
I had a dream...

1327
01:24:48,217 --> 01:24:51,185
<i>And that dream was to
become an anthropologist.</i>

1328
01:24:51,187 --> 01:24:54,254
Now, no accomplishment
comes easily...

1329
01:24:54,256 --> 01:24:57,724
stop! Stop!
This whole thing is a fraud!

1330
01:24:57,726 --> 01:25:01,295
I have been faxed with proof...

1331
01:25:01,297 --> 01:25:03,397
That the shelmikedmu
do not exist!

1332
01:25:03,399 --> 01:25:06,300
Professor, are you out of your mind?
What are you saying?

1333
01:25:06,302 --> 01:25:10,404
I hold here a facsimile from Professor
Ruth Allen in new Guinea...

1334
01:25:10,406 --> 01:25:14,141
Confirming that there is no evidence
whatsoever of the shelmikedmu.

1335
01:25:14,143 --> 01:25:18,245
Gerald.<i>- Ladies and gentlemen,
there's been a small misunderstanding.</i>

1336
01:25:18,247 --> 01:25:20,481
Give me that. See for yourself.
They do not exist!

1337
01:25:20,483 --> 01:25:23,383
Hey. Hold on.

1338
01:25:23,385 --> 01:25:27,254
To any of you familiar
with the shelmikedmu,

1339
01:25:27,256 --> 01:25:30,557
it's not surprising that Professor
Allen couldn't find them.

1340
01:25:30,559 --> 01:25:33,760
- And why not?
- "Why not?"

1341
01:25:33,762 --> 01:25:37,831
There is a very good reason
why not.

1342
01:25:39,535 --> 01:25:42,136
And my brother Mickey...

1343
01:25:42,138 --> 01:25:44,505
<i>Will explain it to you.</i>

1344
01:25:44,507 --> 01:25:46,573
Well, yes, um,

1345
01:25:47,543 --> 01:25:49,543
the reason why...

1346
01:25:49,545 --> 01:25:53,413
Professor Allen was not able
to locate the shelmikedmu...

1347
01:25:53,415 --> 01:25:56,917
I-it's quite simple. You see, they
practice an obscure ritual...

1348
01:25:56,919 --> 01:25:58,752
<i>Called</i> bu api...

1349
01:25:58,754 --> 01:26:03,657
<i>In which the gods instruct them
to conceal and reveal themselves.</i>

1350
01:26:03,659 --> 01:26:06,160
And now you can't
find them anymore.

1351
01:26:06,162 --> 01:26:08,195
Exactly.

1352
01:26:08,197 --> 01:26:09,830
<i>This...</i>

1353
01:26:09,832 --> 01:26:12,466
these children are
part of the conspiracy.

1354
01:26:12,468 --> 01:26:14,434
This tribe is a fraud!

1355
01:26:14,436 --> 01:26:17,771
- It's not a fraud!
- Eddie.

1356
01:26:21,377 --> 01:26:23,677
There has to be
a shelmikedmu tribe,

1357
01:26:23,679 --> 01:26:26,647
<i>because if there isn't we
won't have fun anymore...</i>

1358
01:26:26,649 --> 01:26:28,849
Watching Shelly
chase chickens...

1359
01:26:28,851 --> 01:26:31,351
And dancing together.

1360
01:26:31,353 --> 01:26:34,288
It'll be like it was
after mom died...

1361
01:26:34,290 --> 01:26:36,323
And nobody was happy.

1362
01:26:37,493 --> 01:26:41,228
Tell them. Tell them.

1363
01:26:54,376 --> 01:26:56,810
No, don't.

1364
01:26:56,812 --> 01:26:59,379
<i>Ohh!</i>

1365
01:27:00,883 --> 01:27:02,883
<i>Krippendorf!</i>

1366
01:27:02,885 --> 01:27:04,918
James! Professor!

1367
01:27:04,920 --> 01:27:07,287
Krippendorf? <i> I knew it!</i>

1368
01:27:07,289 --> 01:27:09,256
The children know nothing!

1369
01:27:13,295 --> 01:27:17,798
Personally, I would like to string you up
by that sheath and hang you out to dry.

1370
01:27:17,800 --> 01:27:22,436
The humiliation this university
will have to endure...

1371
01:27:22,438 --> 01:27:24,438
On account of your actions...

1372
01:27:24,440 --> 01:27:26,440
Is unthinkable.

1373
01:27:26,442 --> 01:27:31,345
<i>I warned you, James, and now
you are going to pay big-time!</i>

1374
01:27:31,347 --> 01:27:33,347
<i>Very</i> big-time!

1375
01:27:33,349 --> 01:27:37,551
I only hope you both stole enough money
so you can afford a damn good lawyer!

1376
01:27:37,553 --> 01:27:40,420
A very good damn lawyer!
Gentlemen.

1377
01:27:40,422 --> 01:27:44,024
We have to put aside
personal revenge...

1378
01:27:44,026 --> 01:27:46,393
<i>And consider what's best</i>
<i>for the university.</i>

1379
01:27:46,395 --> 01:27:48,395
For the university. Exactly.

1380
01:27:50,366 --> 01:27:52,933
All this happened because...

1381
01:27:52,935 --> 01:27:56,403
I'm sorry to interrupt, but there's an
urgent call from a Professor Allen...

1382
01:27:56,405 --> 01:27:59,306
<i>In new Guinea on line three.</i>

1383
01:27:59,308 --> 01:28:01,308
Yeah. Thank you.

1384
01:28:01,310 --> 01:28:03,410
I'm sure we all
want to hear this.

1385
01:28:04,947 --> 01:28:08,315
President
Porter here, Professor.

1386
01:28:08,317 --> 01:28:11,818
Hello, Ruth... with
Adams and krippendorf.

1387
01:28:11,820 --> 01:28:13,820
You're on the speakerphone.

1388
01:28:13,822 --> 01:28:16,523
- I want to thank you for...
<i>- We've found them.</i>

1389
01:28:16,525 --> 01:28:19,393
I'm sorry, Ruth. It sounded as
if you said you found something.

1390
01:28:19,395 --> 01:28:21,395
What did you find?

1391
01:28:21,397 --> 01:28:24,398
Aaaah! <i>What was that, Ruth?
I couldn't hear you.</i>

1392
01:28:24,400 --> 01:28:28,368
<i>Ruth?
Could you say it again, please?</i>

1393
01:28:28,370 --> 01:28:31,071
<i>¶¶</i>

1394
01:28:31,073 --> 01:28:33,307
<i>What did you find?</i>

1395
01:28:34,076 --> 01:28:36,710
The shelmikedmu.

1396
01:28:36,712 --> 01:28:39,713
Stop that drumming!

1397
01:28:39,715 --> 01:28:42,015
We found the shelmikedmu.

1398
01:28:42,017 --> 01:28:45,519
I am on the phone.
I am on the phone!

1399
01:28:45,521 --> 01:28:49,856
<i>Lori, you are
driving me "f" -ing crazy!</i>

1400
01:28:49,858 --> 01:28:52,592
We found the shelmikedmu.

1401
01:28:52,594 --> 01:28:54,928
<i>- No, no, no. Wait a minute.
- Yes.</i>

1402
01:28:54,930 --> 01:28:56,763
<i>Yes, we found the shelmikedmu.</i>

1403
01:28:56,765 --> 01:28:59,499
<i>How can you do this, Ruth?</i>

1404
01:28:59,501 --> 01:29:02,869
<i>I'm losing you. I am losing you!</i>

1405
01:29:02,871 --> 01:29:05,872
<i>- He is right here in this room!</i>
- You tell me now that...

1406
01:29:05,874 --> 01:29:08,842
we'll send out a press
release immediately...

1407
01:29:08,844 --> 01:29:11,478
Explaining that
what happened tonight...

1408
01:29:11,480 --> 01:29:13,747
<i>Was all a practical joke. No, no, no, no...</i>

1409
01:29:13,749 --> 01:29:16,416
that's what we'll do.

1410
01:29:16,418 --> 01:29:18,085
Exactly.

1411
01:29:18,087 --> 01:29:19,820
Yes.

1412
01:29:20,956 --> 01:29:24,558
Well, there's just so much
that I could say,

1413
01:29:24,560 --> 01:29:27,561
but I think I'll be a bigger
person than you and not say it.

1414
01:29:27,563 --> 01:29:30,497
Children, let's go.
Ms. Micelli.

1415
01:29:30,499 --> 01:29:33,867
That does not
surprise me at all, because...

1416
01:29:33,869 --> 01:29:35,535
you're fired.

1417
01:29:35,537 --> 01:29:37,471
Exactly.

1418
01:29:37,473 --> 01:29:39,573
What do you want, guys?
I want a hot dog.

1419
01:29:39,575 --> 01:29:41,608
A hot dog.

1420
01:29:45,614 --> 01:29:47,681
Hello, hello.

1421
01:29:47,683 --> 01:29:49,683
Any problems, papa sulukim?

1422
01:29:49,685 --> 01:29:51,885
<i>¶No!</i>

1423
01:29:51,887 --> 01:29:54,521
Not a one, Shelly. Not a one.

1424
01:29:54,523 --> 01:29:57,524
So Professor Allen
swallowed the whole thing?

1425
01:29:57,526 --> 01:30:02,529
Good for you, too, because no amount of money
could get me to wear a penis sheath again.

1426
01:30:02,531 --> 01:30:05,565
Well, I sent your stuff
this morning.

1427
01:30:05,567 --> 01:30:07,501
Any problems, call me.

1428
01:30:07,503 --> 01:30:09,503
Take care of yourself,

1429
01:30:09,505 --> 01:30:11,505
my little Shelly krippendorf,

1430
01:30:11,507 --> 01:30:13,140
and<i> hamamass.</i>

1431
01:30:13,142 --> 01:30:15,675
<i>Hamamass,</i> papa sulukim.

1432
01:30:15,677 --> 01:30:17,944
<i>Eee-eee-eee-eee</i> and thanks.

1433
01:30:17,946 --> 01:30:21,948

<i>ee-wi-om-om-moweh</i>

1434
01:30:21,950 --> 01:30:24,151
so, when exactly did...

1435
01:30:24,153 --> 01:30:26,720
it's a tribal thing.

1436
01:30:26,722 --> 01:30:30,757
<i>Wi-om-om-mowehyour father's right.
The timototta are wrong.</i>

1437
01:30:30,759 --> 01:30:33,460
We'll just stick with the shelmikedmu.
I never said that.

1438
01:30:33,462 --> 01:30:36,496
You know where we went wrong with them?
Yes, I do.

1439
01:30:36,498 --> 01:30:40,000
There is no such tribe. That's where we went wrong.
Be that as it may...

1440
01:30:40,002 --> 01:30:43,503
we blew the publishing. Big time!
Thank you! See?

1441
01:30:43,505 --> 01:30:47,040
Okay, so what we're gonna do with the shelmikedmu...
there is no such thing.

1442
01:30:47,042 --> 01:30:50,577
We're going to concentrate our
efforts on a glossy presentation.

1443
01:30:50,579 --> 01:30:53,980
Does anybody listen to me?
There is no such tribe.

1444
01:30:57,553 --> 01:30:58,053
