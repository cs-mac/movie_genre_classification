1
00:00:38,353 --> 00:00:41,272
Money, money, money, money

2
00:00:41,523 --> 00:00:42,857
Money

3
00:00:43,108 --> 00:00:45,193
Money, money, money, money

4
00:00:46,278 --> 00:00:47,570
Money

5
00:00:47,821 --> 00:00:49,948
Money, money, money, money

6
00:00:50,907 --> 00:00:52,242
Money

7
00:00:52,492 --> 00:00:54,744
Money, money, money, money

8
00:00:55,829 --> 00:00:57,038
Money

9
00:00:57,289 --> 00:00:59,666
Money, money, money, money

10
00:01:00,667 --> 00:01:02,002
Money

11
00:01:02,252 --> 00:01:04,379
Money, money, money, money

12
00:01:05,588 --> 00:01:06,881
Money

13
00:01:21,396 --> 00:01:24,608
Some people got to have it

14
00:01:24,858 --> 00:01:25,984
Hey, hey, hey

15
00:01:26,234 --> 00:01:28,778
Some people really need it

16
00:01:29,029 --> 00:01:30,822
Hey, listen to me, y'all

17
00:01:31,072 --> 00:01:35,410
Do things, do things,
do things, bad things with it

18
00:01:39,414 --> 00:01:46,171
You wanna do things, do things,
do things, good things with it, yeah

19
00:01:47,922 --> 00:01:51,801
Uh-huh, talk about
money, money, money, money

20
00:01:52,052 --> 00:01:55,138
People will steal from their mother

21
00:01:56,973 --> 00:01:59,893
People will rob their own brother

22
00:02:01,811 --> 00:02:04,689
People can't even walk the streets

23
00:02:04,939 --> 00:02:08,818
Because they never know
who in the world they're gonna beat

24
00:02:09,069 --> 00:02:13,448
For that mean, oh mean

25
00:02:13,698 --> 00:02:15,867
Mean green

26
00:02:16,117 --> 00:02:19,454
Almighty dollar, money

27
00:02:24,668 --> 00:02:25,794
For the love of money

28
00:02:26,044 --> 00:02:29,214
People will lie, Lord, they will cheat

29
00:02:29,464 --> 00:02:30,924
For the love of money

30
00:02:31,174 --> 00:02:34,260
People don't care
who they hurt or beat

31
00:02:34,511 --> 00:02:35,595
For the love of money

32
00:02:35,845 --> 00:02:38,807
A woman will sell her preclous body

33
00:02:39,057 --> 00:02:43,103
For a small piece of paper,
lt carrles a lot of weight

34
00:02:43,353 --> 00:02:47,691
For that mean, mean, mean, mean

35
00:02:47,941 --> 00:02:50,068
Mean green

36
00:02:50,318 --> 00:02:53,071
Almighty dollar

37
00:03:14,217 --> 00:03:17,429
Whoa! No. Oh, no.

38
00:03:17,679 --> 00:03:20,432
Tax fraud. No, no. Oh, no. Oh, no.

39
00:03:20,682 --> 00:03:23,518
I mean, this is a miscalculation.

40
00:03:23,768 --> 00:03:25,979
Yes, I mean,
a misunderstanding certainly.

41
00:03:26,229 --> 00:03:29,691
I would even go so far as to admit
that it was bad judgement.

42
00:03:29,941 --> 00:03:33,820
It could be really bad judgement
but it's certainly not tax fraud.

43
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:38,116
We need to meet with you and your client
at his office tomorrow at 10.00.

44
00:03:39,576 --> 00:03:41,786
All right. We'll be there. 10.00.

45
00:03:42,037 --> 00:03:45,540
Good. Otherwise warrants get issued.

46
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:49,044
Property gets attached.
Everyone gets very cranky.

47
00:03:49,294 --> 00:03:52,422
Well, we don't want cranky, do we?

48
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:56,176
No. We don't.

49
00:03:59,262 --> 00:04:03,183
Sleep well, Mr Lachman.
We'll see you tomorrow. 10.00.

50
00:04:24,412 --> 00:04:28,792
Heaven, l'm in heaven

51
00:04:31,044 --> 00:04:38,009
And my heart beats
so that l can hardly speak

52
00:04:38,259 --> 00:04:44,849
And l seem to find
the happiness l seek

53
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:50,230
When we're out together
danclng cheek to cheek

54
00:05:03,076 --> 00:05:06,621
- Thank you.
- Well, this is our big night.

55
00:05:06,871 --> 00:05:07,956
Yes, it is.

56
00:05:08,206 --> 00:05:10,667
You work the girls
and I'll work the boys.

57
00:05:10,917 --> 00:05:12,836
Sounds great. See you soon.

58
00:05:13,962 --> 00:05:16,798
- Not soon enough.
- Oh!

59
00:05:19,843 --> 00:05:22,846
- La-la-la.
- Oh, Caroline. Mwah.

60
00:05:23,096 --> 00:05:24,806
- Mwah-mwah.
- Oh, Caroline.

61
00:05:25,056 --> 00:05:27,726
- What a fabulous look, as usual.
- Oh, thank you.

62
00:05:27,976 --> 00:05:30,061
Ten years. Can you believe it?

63
00:05:30,312 --> 00:05:33,606
It's easy to believe.
It's just a little tough to admit.

64
00:05:33,857 --> 00:05:37,402
I'm just glad someone's
happily married. Even if it isn't mol.

65
00:05:37,652 --> 00:05:38,612
Oh, honey.

66
00:05:38,862 --> 00:05:43,658
I still can't believe you haven't traded
in Brad for one of those hot new models.

67
00:05:43,908 --> 00:05:47,203
Oh, sweetheart.
You never trade in a classic.

68
00:05:47,454 --> 00:05:49,497
- Oh, meow.
- Oh.

69
00:05:49,748 --> 00:05:52,292
- They're so happy.
- I'm so jealous.

70
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:56,630
lmagine, if you will, a mecca,

71
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:01,217
where people from all over the world
can partake in a celebration

72
00:06:01,468 --> 00:06:03,845
of miracles.

73
00:06:04,095 --> 00:06:09,476
We will lift their souls...
while we lighten their wallets.

74
00:06:13,688 --> 00:06:17,484
Ladies and gentlemen, behold...

75
00:06:17,734 --> 00:06:19,653
the Holyland.

76
00:06:20,904 --> 00:06:25,367
Hallelujahl Hallelujahl

77
00:06:29,245 --> 00:06:30,997
This is amazing, isn't it?

78
00:06:31,247 --> 00:06:33,667
A theme park inspired by God Himself.

79
00:06:35,835 --> 00:06:39,547
Brad, darling, look who I found.

80
00:06:40,882 --> 00:06:43,301
Your Honour.
It's a thrill to have you here.

81
00:06:43,551 --> 00:06:45,845
- And it's a pleasure to be here.
- Thank you.

82
00:06:46,096 --> 00:06:49,474
And my favourite attorney.
I owe you one, buddy.

83
00:06:49,724 --> 00:06:51,518
You sure do.

84
00:06:52,936 --> 00:06:55,855
All right. May I continue?
Let me take you on a journey.

85
00:06:56,106 --> 00:06:58,525
Step this way.
All right.

86
00:06:58,775 --> 00:07:01,987
Now. Welcome to the Holyland.

87
00:07:02,237 --> 00:07:05,156
Check it out. Bedouin Breakfast.
You gotta love it.

88
00:07:05,407 --> 00:07:08,576
What is this,
a sell job or an anniversary party?

89
00:07:08,827 --> 00:07:11,997
For our Jewish guests,
Torah, Torah, Torah: The Waterslide.

90
00:07:12,247 --> 00:07:15,625
For our Japanese guests,
Tora, Tora, Tora: The Waterslide.

91
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:18,545
Look. Water lnto Winery.

92
00:07:18,795 --> 00:07:21,756
And what a great year for wine. Mm. One.

93
00:07:22,924 --> 00:07:27,053
My favourite attraction. Here it is.
The Burning Bush.

94
00:07:27,304 --> 00:07:30,765
Twice a night,
we light up the skies with this.

95
00:07:45,071 --> 00:07:48,825
Mr Sexton, not only
have you no respect for religion,

96
00:07:49,075 --> 00:07:51,953
but you have ruined
my favourite Balenciaga.

97
00:07:52,203 --> 00:07:55,999
I can assure you that if you go ahead
with this... heresy,

98
00:07:56,249 --> 00:07:59,628
you and anyone else
stupid enough to get involved

99
00:07:59,878 --> 00:08:02,172
will burn in hell.

100
00:08:03,048 --> 00:08:05,800
- Judge Northcutt...
- Your Honour, please wait.

101
00:08:06,051 --> 00:08:08,178
Does this mean
we won't be having dessert?

102
00:08:08,428 --> 00:08:11,139
Uh, Judge...

103
00:08:11,389 --> 00:08:13,558
What the hell's a Balenciaga?

104
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,873
Yo, Picasso. Let's go.

105
00:08:39,918 --> 00:08:42,754
- Happy anniversary, Mr Sexton.
- Thank you, Winston.

106
00:08:43,004 --> 00:08:44,714
Coh!

107
00:09:06,361 --> 00:09:10,907
After tonight, I don't know how I'll
ever be able to face my friends again.

108
00:09:11,157 --> 00:09:13,910
Just pretend they're a mirror.

109
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,996
You're so funny, honey.

110
00:09:16,246 --> 00:09:19,249
I'll just confess to them
that I'm married to a moron.

111
00:09:19,499 --> 00:09:22,627
That way they'll feel sorry for me,
then they'll forgive me.

112
00:09:22,877 --> 00:09:26,006
Well, this moron built you
this fabulous life.

113
00:09:26,256 --> 00:09:29,634
Oh, that again.
Oh, I forgot. That's right, honey.

114
00:09:29,884 --> 00:09:32,887
You did everything and I did nothing.

115
00:09:33,138 --> 00:09:37,434
Well, I have developed 16 commercial
properties in the last five years,

116
00:09:37,684 --> 00:09:40,186
including Euro-Alcatraz.

117
00:09:40,437 --> 00:09:44,566
Hm. I'm sorry.
Did you say "Euro-Alcatraz"?

118
00:09:44,816 --> 00:09:48,320
Vacation in the Big House.

119
00:09:49,404 --> 00:09:51,531
- Say, did you hear that?
- What?

120
00:09:51,781 --> 00:09:55,285
The sound of an entire continent
laughing at you.

121
00:09:55,535 --> 00:09:59,289
Ouch. Caroline,
refresh my memory, will you, please?

122
00:09:59,539 --> 00:10:02,334
What exactly have you done
in the past five years?

123
00:10:02,584 --> 00:10:04,252
Wait a minute. I know.

124
00:10:04,502 --> 00:10:07,172
You've done Bloomingdale's.
You've done lunch.

125
00:10:07,422 --> 00:10:10,425
You've done chemical peels.
You've done collagen.

126
00:10:10,675 --> 00:10:13,678
You've done liposuction.

127
00:10:13,928 --> 00:10:17,682
- Wow.
- You poor, deluded little monkey.

128
00:10:17,932 --> 00:10:21,311
Who do you think brought you
to these people, huh?

129
00:10:21,561 --> 00:10:23,897
Without me, Brad, you would be nothing.

130
00:10:29,235 --> 00:10:30,195
I beg your pardon,

131
00:10:30,445 --> 00:10:33,865
but I had a very successful real estate
career before I ever met you.

132
00:10:34,115 --> 00:10:36,076
Oh, really.

133
00:10:36,326 --> 00:10:40,538
So you consider leasing parking spaces
a real estate career?

134
00:10:40,789 --> 00:10:44,876
Well, here's a newsflash.
I took you from K-Mart to Tiffany's.

135
00:10:45,126 --> 00:10:47,712
- I invented you.
- OK.

136
00:10:47,963 --> 00:10:51,007
Then I guess you have
no one else to blame but yourself.

137
00:10:51,257 --> 00:10:52,759
That's...

138
00:10:53,009 --> 00:10:55,011
I guess not.

139
00:10:57,597 --> 00:10:59,557
Good night.

140
00:11:09,067 --> 00:11:12,070
Brad, darling, here's a thought.

141
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:16,658
Since you're so good with fire,
why not set up a barbecue barrel on 42nd

142
00:11:16,908 --> 00:11:19,369
and sell flame-broiled pigeons?

143
00:11:19,619 --> 00:11:22,580
Or you should write a cookbook.
How To Roast Your Own Nuts.

144
00:11:22,831 --> 00:11:24,916
What do you think, Brad?

145
00:11:26,543 --> 00:11:29,546
You know what I think?
I think I'm tired of busting my ass

146
00:11:29,796 --> 00:11:33,925
while you sit on your ever-widening one,
criticizing everything I do.

147
00:11:34,175 --> 00:11:39,389
I spent the last six months busting
this ever-widening ass, and for what?

148
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:44,436
So you could turn our anniversary into
a carny sideshow to promote a lame idea?

149
00:11:44,686 --> 00:11:47,856
All right, Caroline.
What is this really about?

150
00:11:48,106 --> 00:11:52,027
Nothing, Brad. Just another thrilling
Saturday night at the Sextons'.

151
00:11:52,986 --> 00:11:55,739
Are you so pissed off
about the incident at the party?

152
00:11:55,989 --> 00:11:59,326
No. I am pissed because
if I had just stayed in fashion design

153
00:11:59,576 --> 00:12:01,244
instead of wasting my time on you,

154
00:12:01,494 --> 00:12:03,872
I would probably have
my own collection by now.

155
00:12:04,122 --> 00:12:08,209
Ah. So instead, you're collecting
everyone else's collection.

156
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:11,004
Hm. Don't you get it?

157
00:12:11,254 --> 00:12:13,214
I gave it up to help you.

158
00:12:13,465 --> 00:12:17,260
You gave it up because you were afraid
you might have to finish something.

159
00:12:23,308 --> 00:12:26,561
- I'm tired.
- Then go to bed.

160
00:12:26,811 --> 00:12:28,938
No. Of this.

161
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:33,526
What used to work in this marriage
doesn't work anymore.

162
00:12:33,777 --> 00:12:36,446
Oh, God, here it comes.
The divorce talk again.

163
00:12:36,696 --> 00:12:38,823
We're wasting our time.
What's the point?

164
00:12:39,074 --> 00:12:41,910
lf you want out, just say the word.

165
00:12:43,036 --> 00:12:44,162
Out.

166
00:12:45,413 --> 00:12:47,916
- What?
- Out.

167
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:50,502
- You want a divorce?
- I need a divorce.

168
00:12:50,752 --> 00:12:52,420
- You got it.
- Good.

169
00:12:52,671 --> 00:12:54,714
- We'll split everything.
- Split what?

170
00:12:54,965 --> 00:12:57,634
We don't own any of this shit.
All we have is debt.

171
00:12:57,842 --> 00:12:59,844
I'd be glad to split that fifty-fifty.

172
00:13:00,095 --> 00:13:02,514
Fifty-fifty? Not on your life.

173
00:13:02,764 --> 00:13:06,393
- Then it'll get ugly.
- Good. I can do ugly.

174
00:13:06,643 --> 00:13:08,979
I've done you for the last ten years.

175
00:13:10,397 --> 00:13:13,400
As memory serves, you stopped
doing me after six and a half.

176
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:16,111
- Happy anniversary, honey.
- Fuck off!

177
00:13:16,361 --> 00:13:17,529
OK.

178
00:13:31,126 --> 00:13:35,088
Holy smoke.
Why did l ever get mixed up with you?

179
00:13:35,338 --> 00:13:38,591
You're becoming
awfully disagreeable lately.

180
00:13:38,842 --> 00:13:41,344
You snap my head off
every time l open my mouth.

181
00:13:41,594 --> 00:13:45,598
If being with me ils so dilstasteful
to you, you can leave.

182
00:13:45,849 --> 00:13:48,727
You can leave any time you see fit.

183
00:13:48,977 --> 00:13:50,979
Nobody is holding you here.

184
00:13:53,106 --> 00:13:55,191
I can get along.

185
00:14:14,878 --> 00:14:16,671
- Morning, guys.
- Mr Sexton.

186
00:14:19,174 --> 00:14:21,051
Morning, Penny. Well, did it come?

187
00:14:21,301 --> 00:14:23,595
Just arrived. All fixed.

188
00:14:23,845 --> 00:14:26,431
- That'll be $96.
- I'll owe you, OK?

189
00:14:26,681 --> 00:14:28,933
I can't. Not this time.

190
00:14:29,184 --> 00:14:32,020
And I'll need cash.

191
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:34,814
- Really?
- Really.

192
00:14:36,107 --> 00:14:40,487
OK. I'll go to the bank today.
You'll get your cash.

193
00:14:40,737 --> 00:14:45,325
- Have I shown you the back of this?
- Yes, you've shown it to me many times.

194
00:14:45,575 --> 00:14:48,703
- Oh, your new chair is here.
- ls it?

195
00:14:51,581 --> 00:14:55,627
- Oh, Bob.
- Uh... B-B-Brad. Brad. What...

196
00:14:55,877 --> 00:14:59,339
- Where are you going with all that?
- Nowhere. This is nothing.

197
00:14:59,589 --> 00:15:02,425
- I am going some place...
- Put a hold on it.

198
00:15:02,676 --> 00:15:05,553
- I want to talk to you.
- I would love to but...

199
00:15:05,804 --> 00:15:07,931
Bob.

200
00:15:14,312 --> 00:15:16,731
- I've got your number.
- Huh?

201
00:15:19,859 --> 00:15:22,904
- Number, please.
- New satellite phone. From Osaka. Huh?

202
00:15:23,196 --> 00:15:25,949
Got your number.
This will pick up a signal anywhere.

203
00:15:26,199 --> 00:15:28,201
- That's great but I gotta go.
- Wait!

204
00:15:28,451 --> 00:15:31,538
I got one more thing to show you.
Please. Just take a minute.

205
00:15:31,788 --> 00:15:34,207
Oh, by the way.
How did that IRS thing come out?

206
00:15:34,457 --> 00:15:38,169
- Are we gonna survive?
- Uh... sure. I took care of everything.

207
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:40,672
That's what I want to hear.

208
00:15:43,717 --> 00:15:47,512
What do you think?
The Shiatsu 2000 Massage Experience.

209
00:15:47,762 --> 00:15:50,265
- That's fantastic. I gotta go.
- Wait a minute!

210
00:15:50,515 --> 00:15:52,767
Come on, Bob. Look at this.
Oh, feeling good.

211
00:15:53,018 --> 00:15:55,603
I got the manicure-pedicure option,

212
00:15:55,854 --> 00:15:59,441
and I can sit here while I'm getting
my back rubbed and get a facial too.

213
00:15:59,691 --> 00:16:03,403
- What do you think?
- You're spending development money

214
00:16:03,653 --> 00:16:04,988
on stupid toys.

215
00:16:05,238 --> 00:16:08,617
These are not stupid toys.
These are business tools.

216
00:16:10,118 --> 00:16:12,162
I write all this stuff off.

217
00:16:14,122 --> 00:16:16,625
Yeah, that's what I do.
I could do a lot more.

218
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:20,712
I got a working knowledge of every inch
of this place. I got... I got...

219
00:16:20,962 --> 00:16:23,673
I gotta go. I'm, I'm really late.

220
00:16:23,923 --> 00:16:28,345
I'll walk out with you. There's
something else I should tell you.

221
00:16:28,595 --> 00:16:30,305
Great.

222
00:16:33,808 --> 00:16:35,685
Come on, come on!

223
00:16:40,148 --> 00:16:42,651
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

224
00:16:43,401 --> 00:16:46,863
Well, Caroline and l
have decided to call it quits.

225
00:16:48,823 --> 00:16:52,160
Gee, that's too bad. Sorry to hear
that you two are splitting.

226
00:16:55,246 --> 00:16:57,207
Did he say "splitting"?

227
00:17:00,627 --> 00:17:03,922
Miss. IRS Field Agent Hall.
Where did Mr Sexton go?

228
00:17:04,172 --> 00:17:06,633
Well, he better be going to the bank.

229
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:09,386
Bank?

230
00:17:09,636 --> 00:17:11,638
The bank. He's running.

231
00:17:11,888 --> 00:17:13,974
Get backup.
Have them meet me there. Move.

232
00:17:15,892 --> 00:17:19,396
He did my first two divorces,
and if I ever get married again,

233
00:17:19,646 --> 00:17:20,730
he'll do my third.

234
00:17:20,981 --> 00:17:23,275
- Brad won't know what hit him.
- Coh.

235
00:17:23,525 --> 00:17:26,194
You're so lucky not to have a pre-nup.

236
00:17:26,444 --> 00:17:29,155
We didn't have anything.
There was nothing to nup.

237
00:17:29,406 --> 00:17:32,867
- Oh. You're gonna get it all.
- Uh. That's mine.

238
00:17:33,118 --> 00:17:36,204
You got it last time.

239
00:18:12,907 --> 00:18:15,785
No, no, no, no, no.

240
00:18:16,828 --> 00:18:18,788
Hey! Hey!

241
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:20,749
I don't have time for this!

242
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:23,710
Son of a...

243
00:18:25,545 --> 00:18:26,463
Oh!

244
00:18:30,675 --> 00:18:33,845
Do not pass go. Do not collect $200.

245
00:18:34,095 --> 00:18:36,514
This is where the fun begins.

246
00:18:36,765 --> 00:18:39,100
- Who the hell are you?
- lnspector Lester.

247
00:18:39,351 --> 00:18:41,853
I'm here to bring in the suspect.

248
00:18:42,103 --> 00:18:46,942
lnspector Derek Lester? Wow.
Sir, I heard about you at the Academy.

249
00:18:47,192 --> 00:18:49,152
I'm sure you did, son.

250
00:18:49,402 --> 00:18:53,615
Whoa. Look, sir. Hey,
I know I may be a little new at this

251
00:18:53,865 --> 00:18:56,618
but we don't shoot people
for cheating on their taxes.

252
00:18:56,868 --> 00:18:59,245
Oh. You're right.

253
00:19:00,705 --> 00:19:02,832
You are new at this.

254
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:07,295
My accounts are frozen?

255
00:19:07,545 --> 00:19:09,965
It means you can't touch them.

256
00:19:10,215 --> 00:19:13,510
I know what you mean. Who froze them?

257
00:19:14,594 --> 00:19:16,680
That information is confidential.

258
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:18,556
Really.

259
00:19:19,975 --> 00:19:20,934
Caroline.

260
00:19:22,435 --> 00:19:26,022
Huh. Excuse me, sweetheart,
but this card has no limit.

261
00:19:26,272 --> 00:19:28,441
I'm sorry to say... it does.

262
00:19:28,692 --> 00:19:31,903
Huh. I knew he was too good to be true.

263
00:19:32,153 --> 00:19:34,614
Let the games begin.

264
00:19:35,865 --> 00:19:37,325
That bastard.

265
00:19:37,659 --> 00:19:39,869
That bitch.

266
00:19:51,923 --> 00:19:53,508
Jesus.

267
00:19:55,885 --> 00:19:57,846
- Bob Lachman.
- Ah, Bob. Brad.

268
00:19:58,096 --> 00:19:59,014
Oh, Brad.

269
00:19:59,264 --> 00:20:03,893
Listen. Somehow, Caroline has managed
to freeze all of my accounts.

270
00:20:04,144 --> 00:20:06,229
Caroline? Are you sure?

271
00:20:06,479 --> 00:20:08,732
Well, who the hell else would it be?

272
00:20:08,982 --> 00:20:12,277
Well, you know there was
that little IRS audit thing?

273
00:20:12,527 --> 00:20:15,905
I left out a few little details.

274
00:20:16,156 --> 00:20:18,533
What sort of little details?

275
00:20:21,786 --> 00:20:23,663
Five million dollars?!

276
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:32,714
Bob, what did you do?

277
00:20:32,964 --> 00:20:36,593
Oh, well, a lot of little things
over a long period of time.

278
00:20:36,843 --> 00:20:38,970
lf it's about money,
I'll give you a raise.

279
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:41,640
Brad, I am insuIt ed.

280
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:44,476
This isn't about money.
It's about respect.

281
00:20:44,726 --> 00:20:46,895
It's about friendship.

282
00:20:47,145 --> 00:20:48,980
Only kidding. It's about the money.

283
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:50,899
Bob, you need help.

284
00:20:51,149 --> 00:20:53,485
I know, I know.
I'm a sick man. I am sick.

285
00:20:53,735 --> 00:20:57,656
But the good news is, now I can afford
to get the help I deserve.

286
00:20:59,199 --> 00:21:00,909
Oh, one more piece of advice.

287
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:05,080
lf I were you, I would leave town.
I think they're going to arrest you.

288
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:06,831
Arrest me? Why?

289
00:21:07,082 --> 00:21:11,836
Because, you know, it's not my name
on those returns, sluggo. It's yours.

290
00:21:12,087 --> 00:21:13,964
Have a nice day.

291
00:21:14,214 --> 00:21:15,966
Kennedy.

292
00:21:16,216 --> 00:21:18,259
Bob. Bob. Bob, Bob, Bob!

293
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:20,261
Shit!

294
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:23,348
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

295
00:21:23,598 --> 00:21:26,810
Hey, hey, hey! Come on!

296
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:29,270
He's making his move. Let's go.

297
00:21:29,521 --> 00:21:31,481
Come on! You're scratching it!

298
00:21:33,233 --> 00:21:36,027
Come on! Oh!

299
00:21:39,239 --> 00:21:41,491
I don't believe this!

300
00:22:08,059 --> 00:22:09,769
Gun!

301
00:22:16,693 --> 00:22:18,069
Shit!

302
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,238
Hold it! IRS!

303
00:22:22,282 --> 00:22:24,534
IRS?

304
00:22:25,493 --> 00:22:27,245
This is bullshit.

305
00:22:27,495 --> 00:22:30,165
- I can't believe you just shot at him!
- He had a gun!

306
00:22:30,373 --> 00:22:32,417
He had a phone!

307
00:22:33,835 --> 00:22:38,423
Let's hope this discourages future
violations of the tax code. Get the car.

308
00:22:41,843 --> 00:22:44,220
Hold it!

309
00:22:46,014 --> 00:22:47,891
Run, Sexton!

310
00:22:48,975 --> 00:22:50,769
You're making my day!

311
00:22:59,152 --> 00:23:00,820
Oheater!

312
00:23:02,072 --> 00:23:04,199
Run, Sexton!

313
00:23:04,449 --> 00:23:06,660
He's a cheater!

314
00:23:08,995 --> 00:23:10,872
Watch out. Excuse me. Watch out.

315
00:23:11,122 --> 00:23:13,041
Look out, look out, look out, please!

316
00:23:20,632 --> 00:23:22,717
Go, go, go, go!

317
00:23:22,968 --> 00:23:24,219
Go!

318
00:23:28,306 --> 00:23:31,142
Hey, Malik. Let's go, let's go! Come on.

319
00:23:31,393 --> 00:23:33,645
Smarten up, snapperhead. I'm off duty!

320
00:23:41,736 --> 00:23:44,281
My car!

321
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,491
- Sir!
- Move over!

322
00:23:46,741 --> 00:23:48,243
- What?
- Get over!

323
00:23:48,493 --> 00:23:52,497
Are you gonna chase him? Reckless
pursuits are against our arrest policy!

324
00:23:52,747 --> 00:23:54,833
So is defrauding the government, son.

325
00:23:55,083 --> 00:23:56,084
Wait, wait, wait!

326
00:24:01,089 --> 00:24:02,632
I don't believe this!

327
00:24:06,428 --> 00:24:07,762
This guy's nuts!

328
00:24:12,058 --> 00:24:14,227
When I was your age,
none of this was here.

329
00:24:14,477 --> 00:24:15,395
Sir!

330
00:24:21,026 --> 00:24:24,946
- You can't drive, can you?
- Well, I don't have a licence.

331
00:24:25,196 --> 00:24:26,489
Got you.

332
00:24:36,082 --> 00:24:37,667
Ah.

333
00:24:41,963 --> 00:24:43,506
Wait here.

334
00:24:54,351 --> 00:24:56,645
Columbus and 69th.

335
00:24:57,562 --> 00:25:00,231
This just keeps
getting better and better.

336
00:25:00,482 --> 00:25:03,360
Brad? What are you doing driving a cab?

337
00:25:03,610 --> 00:25:05,654
I thought we could use the extra money.

338
00:25:05,904 --> 00:25:08,281
And why did you cancel my credit cards?

339
00:25:08,531 --> 00:25:10,408
I didn't...

340
00:25:11,242 --> 00:25:12,994
Hold on.

341
00:25:21,962 --> 00:25:23,797
Hold on, son.

342
00:25:28,677 --> 00:25:32,597
Excuse me, do you think you could turn
the corner without wrecking my hair?

343
00:25:32,847 --> 00:25:36,142
You might want to put your seatbeIt on.

344
00:25:47,487 --> 00:25:49,322
Oh, great.

345
00:25:49,572 --> 00:25:51,825
Now the cops are chasing me.

346
00:25:54,786 --> 00:25:57,038
How on earth
can you owe that much money?

347
00:25:57,289 --> 00:26:00,292
I don't know. But I don't owe it.
We owe it. You and l.

348
00:26:00,542 --> 00:26:04,296
Oh, yeah? Maybe if I testify
against you, they'll give me immunity.

349
00:26:04,546 --> 00:26:08,216
Fortunately, they don't allow wives
to testify against their husbands.

350
00:26:08,466 --> 00:26:10,010
How about ex-wives?

351
00:26:45,253 --> 00:26:47,130
It's OK, fellas. IRS.

352
00:26:53,303 --> 00:26:55,180
Well, that worked well.

353
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:15,116
You don't have a clue
where you're going, do you?

354
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:18,870
No. But we can't go back to the city
till I've figured this out.

355
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,873
You know, if you had a brain,
which you clearly don't,

356
00:27:22,123 --> 00:27:25,085
you would have spoken
to your attorney back in New York.

357
00:27:25,335 --> 00:27:28,004
Hey, I was being chased around
by a guy with a big gun.

358
00:27:28,254 --> 00:27:30,632
I didn't have time
to shoot the shit with Phil.

359
00:27:30,882 --> 00:27:33,593
No, but you had time to steaI a cab,
didn't you, Brad?

360
00:27:33,843 --> 00:27:37,180
I'm sorry I didn't find the time
to lift a limo for you.

361
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:39,724
I don't get it.
Leona cheated on her taxes

362
00:27:39,975 --> 00:27:42,060
and she didn't get a bullet in her head.

363
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:46,564
No. Just a cell mate named Wanda
poking her with a toilet brush.

364
00:27:46,815 --> 00:27:50,235
I can't believe we are fleeing the city
like a couple of fugitives.

365
00:27:50,485 --> 00:27:53,321
- That's what criminals do.
- I'm not a criminal, Brad!

366
00:27:55,573 --> 00:27:58,535
Your name was right next to my name
on that tax return.

367
00:27:58,785 --> 00:28:02,372
So as far as the government
is concerned, we are both criminals.

368
00:28:02,622 --> 00:28:04,374
Shut... Argh!

369
00:28:05,333 --> 00:28:07,335
Brad, look out!

370
00:28:10,255 --> 00:28:11,589
Whoa!

371
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,341
Oh, no!

372
00:28:16,136 --> 00:28:19,639
Shit!

373
00:28:31,359 --> 00:28:34,654
- Are you all right?
- No, I'm not all right, you idiot!

374
00:28:34,904 --> 00:28:37,365
We gotta get out. The cab is sinking.

375
00:28:37,616 --> 00:28:41,703
Move out of my way. I'll do it myself.

376
00:28:41,953 --> 00:28:43,580
I'm drowning!

377
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:46,708
Oh, Brad, please don't let me die!

378
00:28:46,958 --> 00:28:48,752
Caroline. Caroline! Stand up.

379
00:28:49,002 --> 00:28:51,171
What?

380
00:28:51,421 --> 00:28:52,797
Oh.

381
00:28:53,048 --> 00:28:55,508
- Come with me.
- Don't touch me.

382
00:29:01,973 --> 00:29:05,393
This is insane.
We've been walking for hours.

383
00:29:05,644 --> 00:29:09,898
It is so obvious that there are
no signs of human life out here.

384
00:29:10,148 --> 00:29:12,651
What do you suggest we do, Mr Spock?

385
00:29:12,901 --> 00:29:15,779
I don't have time
for your stupid jokes, Brad.

386
00:29:16,029 --> 00:29:20,241
Let's just get off the road, we'll rest
and I'll call Phil in the morning.

387
00:29:20,492 --> 00:29:22,786
Are you suggesting
we spend the night out here?

388
00:29:23,036 --> 00:29:23,912
Yes.

389
00:29:24,162 --> 00:29:26,998
Maybe you want to play Davy Crockett,
but I don't camp.

390
00:29:27,248 --> 00:29:30,794
Oh, you don't need to.
Look, there's a Ritz-CarIt on.

391
00:29:31,044 --> 00:29:33,630
- You're such a jerk.
- Come on.

392
00:29:34,506 --> 00:29:36,675
Caroline, come on.

393
00:29:36,925 --> 00:29:39,386
Wait for me.

394
00:29:40,929 --> 00:29:43,598
- Let go of me, please.
- No. I don't want to fall down.

395
00:29:43,848 --> 00:29:46,101
Can you be a gentleman
for once in your life?

396
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:50,522
Here's the deal. Just sit down here
and lean against a tree.

397
00:29:50,772 --> 00:29:52,274
How hard can that be?

398
00:29:52,524 --> 00:29:55,026
Are you sure
they won't attack us in the night?

399
00:29:55,277 --> 00:29:57,362
They're cows!

400
00:29:57,612 --> 00:30:00,615
They only attack
when they're irritated by whining.

401
00:30:00,865 --> 00:30:02,242
Ouch!

402
00:30:02,492 --> 00:30:06,496
I don't have to sleep by you.
I'm taking the other side of this tree.

403
00:30:06,746 --> 00:30:09,082
- Whatever makes you comfy.
- Fine.

404
00:30:15,088 --> 00:30:17,924
Hm. It's actually soft over here.

405
00:30:18,174 --> 00:30:20,552
Probably because
you're sitting in cow dung.

406
00:30:20,802 --> 00:30:22,470
Excuse me?

407
00:30:22,721 --> 00:30:26,850
I said, "My, oh, my, is that cow hung."

408
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:29,352
You're such a pervert.

409
00:31:06,473 --> 00:31:09,225
- Brad! Brad!
- What?

410
00:31:09,476 --> 00:31:12,270
Quiet! Those cows will jump on you.

411
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:14,773
They will?

412
00:31:15,023 --> 00:31:18,610
- Stay there. I'll be right back.
- What do you mean, stay here?

413
00:31:22,072 --> 00:31:25,700
I have cow poop on me!

414
00:31:44,427 --> 00:31:45,595
Not lately.

415
00:32:00,068 --> 00:32:02,153
Ah.

416
00:32:02,404 --> 00:32:04,948
I come in peace.

417
00:32:05,198 --> 00:32:10,203
I just need to use the telephone.

418
00:32:13,832 --> 00:32:16,209
Thank you.

419
00:32:19,713 --> 00:32:21,840
Bastard knew that was cowshit.

420
00:32:23,133 --> 00:32:25,719
Dreadlocks!

421
00:32:27,512 --> 00:32:30,056
Look at me!

422
00:32:30,307 --> 00:32:32,434
Oh! Look at me!

423
00:32:32,684 --> 00:32:35,937
Congratulations, Brad.
You made the front page of the Post.

424
00:32:36,187 --> 00:32:39,024
Liz Smith, photos, the whole shmear.

425
00:32:39,274 --> 00:32:41,318
You're in a little bit of trouble.

426
00:32:41,568 --> 00:32:44,070
This is not a little bit of trouble,
Phil.

427
00:32:44,321 --> 00:32:46,698
I've been chased and shot at
like a wild animal.

428
00:32:46,948 --> 00:32:50,201
What I want you to do is wire me
some cash, some dough-re-mi, pal.

429
00:32:50,452 --> 00:32:52,746
- I need a place to stay.
- No can do, my friend.

430
00:32:52,996 --> 00:32:55,915
- That'd be abetting a felon.
- You abet felons every day.

431
00:32:56,166 --> 00:32:59,961
- You play racquetball with them.
- You know I would love to help you.

432
00:33:00,211 --> 00:33:04,090
Call Lachman. Find him.
He's the one responsible for this mess.

433
00:33:04,341 --> 00:33:06,176
Let me get him.
I'll put you on hold.

434
00:33:06,426 --> 00:33:08,553
Don't put me on... Shit.

435
00:33:10,889 --> 00:33:13,224
The cousins will be moving here
soon enough.

436
00:33:13,475 --> 00:33:14,893
They're from Missouri.

437
00:33:15,143 --> 00:33:18,688
- Brad, you still there?
- Yeah. Where else would I go, Phil?

438
00:33:18,938 --> 00:33:21,483
Our friend Bob's phone
has been disconnected.

439
00:33:21,733 --> 00:33:24,402
What? That dirty son of a...

440
00:33:24,653 --> 00:33:28,239
Calm down. Both of you lie low.
Let me survey the landscape.

441
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:31,242
- Oheck back with me in a day or two.
- Or two?

442
00:33:31,493 --> 00:33:34,496
Tax fraud, resisting arrest,
grand theft auto.

443
00:33:34,746 --> 00:33:38,249
- What were you thinking?
- I was thinking about saving my ass.

444
00:33:40,502 --> 00:33:43,213
Because that donkey's been
in the family for years.

445
00:33:43,463 --> 00:33:46,967
We couldn't live without it.
Save it at any cost. Thanks. Bye.

446
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:50,929
I just love that donkey.

447
00:33:56,476 --> 00:33:58,228
Ow!

448
00:34:00,438 --> 00:34:02,315
Will they make it for planting?

449
00:34:02,565 --> 00:34:05,277
Hard to say.
Could be a month. Maybe two.

450
00:34:05,527 --> 00:34:07,737
Well, too bad for Samuel, eh?

451
00:34:07,988 --> 00:34:10,699
Well, you have everything? Ja? Good.

452
00:34:10,949 --> 00:34:13,243
- God be with you.
- Thank you for your help.

453
00:34:13,493 --> 00:34:15,745
- My pleasure.
- Maybe you'll come and see us.

454
00:34:15,996 --> 00:34:18,081
Maybe.

455
00:34:23,044 --> 00:34:25,588
The reaI cousins
won't be here for a month.

456
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:27,757
We're not gonna get away with it.

457
00:34:28,008 --> 00:34:31,011
Two nights tops, till I get
Phil to pull some strings for us.

458
00:34:31,261 --> 00:34:34,639
It'll work, but you might wanna
tuck those bad boys in.

459
00:34:34,889 --> 00:34:37,267
You look like a Shakespearean whore.

460
00:34:37,517 --> 00:34:40,854
These bad boys cost me $14,000.
I'm not tucking them in.

461
00:34:41,104 --> 00:34:43,690
These people... 14 grand for the set?

462
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:46,318
- I can't look this good for free.
- Yeah.

463
00:34:46,568 --> 00:34:50,822
Fine. lf you paid a little bit
more attention to our finances,

464
00:34:51,072 --> 00:34:53,408
maybe we wouldn't even be in this mess.

465
00:34:53,658 --> 00:34:56,244
That's it. Yoder.

466
00:34:56,494 --> 00:34:59,581
- They've all said Yoder.
- This is it. It's gotta be.

467
00:34:59,831 --> 00:35:02,834
So picturesque.
It's almost surreal. Look at this.

468
00:35:03,084 --> 00:35:05,879
I can almost imagine Planet Amishwood.

469
00:35:06,129 --> 00:35:09,549
Oh, shut up, Brad!
I just want to get this sham over with.

470
00:35:09,799 --> 00:35:12,135
All I want is a hot bath and cosy bed.

471
00:35:12,385 --> 00:35:13,928
OK. Here's the deal.

472
00:35:14,179 --> 00:35:17,307
Follow my lead. I know all
we need to know about being Amish.

473
00:35:17,557 --> 00:35:20,310
- Since when?
- Since I saw Witness.

474
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,604
Tiffany earrings? Dead giveaway.

475
00:35:22,854 --> 00:35:26,149
- No!
- And the lipstick.

476
00:35:26,399 --> 00:35:29,069
- What? All of it?
- Use my sleeve. Come on.

477
00:35:30,612 --> 00:35:33,740
Guess what, Brad. I saw Witness too.

478
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:35,951
And they didn't wear Armani shades.

479
00:35:41,706 --> 00:35:44,709
The rings.
Amish don't wear wedding rings.

480
00:35:50,715 --> 00:35:52,717
OK. Fine. Take 'em.

481
00:35:53,969 --> 00:35:57,430
I wasn't planning on wearing 'em
very much longer anyway.

482
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:02,394
OK. All we gotta do is pretend
to be people that we're not

483
00:36:02,644 --> 00:36:07,607
to fool people we don't know
in a situation we've never been in.

484
00:36:07,857 --> 00:36:09,985
We're from New York. How hard can it be?

485
00:36:11,444 --> 00:36:13,154
Let's go.

486
00:36:13,405 --> 00:36:15,031
Oh!

487
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:18,660
Caroline, come on.

488
00:36:23,290 --> 00:36:25,583
God, you look like an idiot
in that suit.

489
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:12,922
Buzz off, Lassie.

490
00:37:13,173 --> 00:37:14,966
Samson! Down!

491
00:37:18,553 --> 00:37:20,764
- Mr Yoder?
- Ja?

492
00:37:21,014 --> 00:37:23,099
- How may we help you?
- We're the cousins.

493
00:37:24,059 --> 00:37:25,602
- Cousins?
- Your cousins.

494
00:37:25,852 --> 00:37:27,729
- Your kin.
- From Missouri.

495
00:37:29,939 --> 00:37:31,858
- Emma?
- Emma?

496
00:37:32,108 --> 00:37:33,777
- Jacob?
- Jacob.

497
00:37:34,027 --> 00:37:36,279
- Jacob and Emma.
- Yoder.

498
00:37:37,322 --> 00:37:40,367
We weren't expecting you for months.

499
00:37:40,617 --> 00:37:42,994
Surprise!

500
00:37:43,244 --> 00:37:45,914
- What happened to you?
- It's hard to say.

501
00:37:46,122 --> 00:37:53,338
Um... we had a... carriage accident
up by the pond. About six miles back.

502
00:37:53,672 --> 00:37:54,881
Danker's pond.

503
00:37:55,131 --> 00:37:58,760
- The horse. I looked one way. He saw...
- Snakes.

504
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:01,054
And spooked him. And he...

505
00:38:01,304 --> 00:38:02,555
...tore off.
- Drowned.

506
00:38:02,806 --> 00:38:05,266
Tore off and drowned,
and the carriage flipped.

507
00:38:05,517 --> 00:38:08,979
There are pieces of the carriage.
It's been in the family for years.

508
00:38:10,981 --> 00:38:13,400
Ohildren, this is our cousins,
Jacob and Emma.

509
00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:16,236
- Yoder.
- Our eldest, Rebecca.

510
00:38:16,486 --> 00:38:19,990
Anna. Sam Jr. Sammy.

511
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:23,326
Um... would you think it rude or unkind

512
00:38:23,576 --> 00:38:26,288
if maybe I went in
and just washed up a little?

513
00:38:26,538 --> 00:38:28,540
Of course. Please. Come this way.

514
00:38:28,790 --> 00:38:30,458
Hey, thank you, boys.

515
00:38:30,709 --> 00:38:32,919
It's sure good to be here.

516
00:38:41,177 --> 00:38:42,762
Here we go.

517
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:50,103
Everything you need,
you'll find in the dresser.

518
00:38:50,353 --> 00:38:54,441
Blankets. Some clothes that fit.

519
00:38:54,691 --> 00:38:56,985
And the outhouse is right out the back.

520
00:38:59,112 --> 00:39:01,823
I'm sure you want a few minutes to pray
before dinner.

521
00:39:02,073 --> 00:39:05,201
Grandma Yoder is preparing
one of her special meals.

522
00:39:05,452 --> 00:39:08,705
You know, this is so swell.
And your phone is...

523
00:39:08,955 --> 00:39:12,292
My, you must come from
a liberal Ordnung.

524
00:39:12,542 --> 00:39:15,337
Yes. A very liberal Ordnung.

525
00:39:15,587 --> 00:39:20,091
Ours is one of the last remaining old
order Amish communities in the country.

526
00:39:20,342 --> 00:39:23,762
We still do not receive
any electricity or public works.

527
00:39:24,012 --> 00:39:27,599
We like to maintain our purity
and independence from the government.

528
00:39:27,849 --> 00:39:29,517
Don't we... all.

529
00:39:29,768 --> 00:39:33,229
We find it best to remain disconnected
from the outside world,

530
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:36,524
for corruption and materialism
are so commonplace.

531
00:39:36,775 --> 00:39:38,818
Amen to that, sister.

532
00:39:39,069 --> 00:39:41,237
I'm so relieved you're here, Emma.

533
00:39:41,488 --> 00:39:45,825
This time of year, heaven knows
we could really use the extra help.

534
00:39:46,076 --> 00:39:48,036
Welcome.

535
00:39:49,204 --> 00:39:52,123
Extra help? No, no, no!

536
00:39:52,374 --> 00:39:54,042
I can't stay here.

537
00:39:54,292 --> 00:39:57,045
They don't have television.
Or even indoor plumbing.

538
00:39:57,295 --> 00:39:59,756
What did you expect?
Room service and a Jacuzzi?

539
00:40:00,006 --> 00:40:02,467
- It's this or sleeping on cow pies.
- Great.

540
00:40:02,717 --> 00:40:05,011
Cow dung or Ordung.

541
00:40:05,261 --> 00:40:09,057
Ordnung. Ordnung. Learn it!

542
00:40:09,307 --> 00:40:13,979
- Thank God we're from a liberal one.
- Thank God. Why is that, Brad?

543
00:40:14,229 --> 00:40:18,733
So when you blow it
by acting like Marie Antoinette,

544
00:40:18,984 --> 00:40:20,610
we can blame it on our Ordnung.

545
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:23,613
Gee, this bed is awfully small.

546
00:40:23,863 --> 00:40:26,616
You know what?
You don't need to worry about that.

547
00:40:26,866 --> 00:40:31,037
Because in our Ordnung...
the men sleep on the floor.

548
00:40:35,250 --> 00:40:37,043
- What?
- I need a smoke!

549
00:41:05,905 --> 00:41:09,284
Good food. Good meat.

550
00:41:09,534 --> 00:41:12,412
Good God, let's eat.

551
00:41:16,875 --> 00:41:18,460
Amen.

552
00:41:18,752 --> 00:41:22,172
- What's wrong, Emma?
- I'm just anxious.

553
00:41:22,422 --> 00:41:27,093
- You know how long it's been since...
- Emma... is just nervous.

554
00:41:27,344 --> 00:41:30,013
She's a little shy
when she's around new people.

555
00:41:31,056 --> 00:41:35,143
Don't be shy, Emma.
We're not new people. We're cousins.

556
00:41:35,393 --> 00:41:37,520
- What happened to your beard?
- Hm?

557
00:41:37,771 --> 00:41:39,439
Keep to your own, Sammy.

558
00:41:39,689 --> 00:41:44,361
Forgive him, but in our Ordnung, only
the unmarried men go without beards.

559
00:41:44,611 --> 00:41:47,864
- ln all Ordnungs.
- Sam Jr, don't be prideful.

560
00:41:48,114 --> 00:41:50,825
He has a point.
And there's an explanation for it.

561
00:41:51,076 --> 00:41:54,496
A while back in our Ordnung
we had a... um...

562
00:41:54,746 --> 00:41:56,081
- Outbreak.
- An outbreak.

563
00:41:56,331 --> 00:41:58,208
- It was, um...
- Lice.

564
00:41:59,793 --> 00:42:00,794
- Lice?
- Mm.

565
00:42:01,044 --> 00:42:05,256
- But it only lasted a very short time.
- Minute lice.

566
00:42:11,429 --> 00:42:13,890
Jacob, you must be very anxious
to meet Big John.

567
00:42:15,016 --> 00:42:19,062
Of course I am. How is Big John?

568
00:42:19,312 --> 00:42:21,022
Belgians.

569
00:42:22,482 --> 00:42:25,235
I tried your suggestions
but he just wouldn't listen.

570
00:42:25,485 --> 00:42:28,822
Do they ever?
Belgians are only good for two things.

571
00:42:29,072 --> 00:42:31,366
Waffles and deep dark chocolates.

572
00:42:35,662 --> 00:42:39,708
Grandma, if you don't mind,
I'm just gonna go with the salad.

573
00:42:41,626 --> 00:42:46,756
Or better yet,
I'll just eat this enormous wiener.

574
00:42:52,971 --> 00:42:55,640
I'm gonna need
just a little bit of mustard.

575
00:43:12,782 --> 00:43:15,327
- He's up again.
- Who's up again?

576
00:43:15,577 --> 00:43:18,663
Baby Sam, of course.

577
00:43:18,913 --> 00:43:23,001
Oh, yes. Another son of Sam.

578
00:43:23,251 --> 00:43:27,797
I like the name Sam.
Not to be confused with Samuel,

579
00:43:28,048 --> 00:43:32,010
Sammy, Sam Jr and, of course, Sam-son.

580
00:43:36,056 --> 00:43:38,642
- Good evening, folks.
- Evening, Henner.

581
00:43:43,146 --> 00:43:46,524
Henner, these are our cousins,
Jacob and Emma.

582
00:43:46,775 --> 00:43:48,860
Oh, so soon.

583
00:43:49,110 --> 00:43:51,154
That's good, huh?

584
00:43:55,075 --> 00:43:57,202
Guess who's got a boyfriend.

585
00:43:57,452 --> 00:43:59,120
Yeah, well, you go, girl.

586
00:43:59,371 --> 00:44:01,373
"You go, girl"?

587
00:44:01,623 --> 00:44:05,752
Yeah. ln very liberal Ordnungs,

588
00:44:06,002 --> 00:44:08,338
that just means, "He's hot."

589
00:44:10,173 --> 00:44:14,719
- Father?
- Oh, ja, you're excused.

590
00:44:14,970 --> 00:44:17,180
You go, girl.

591
00:44:27,941 --> 00:44:30,986
Another brilliant idea by Brad Sexton.

592
00:44:32,112 --> 00:44:36,449
Caroline, get some rest.
We'll sleep late.

593
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:40,787
I'll get to that phone. I'll call Phil.
He'll... send a car for us.

594
00:44:42,414 --> 00:44:45,542
You better tell Phil to make it snappy.
I don't like it here.

595
00:44:45,792 --> 00:44:48,503
These people are not right!

596
00:44:48,753 --> 00:44:51,047
They're like Children of the Corn.

597
00:44:58,305 --> 00:45:01,808
Oh, finally. Thank God.

598
00:45:06,896 --> 00:45:08,857
Mm.

599
00:45:19,534 --> 00:45:21,494
Morning.

600
00:45:23,246 --> 00:45:25,206
- Who are you?
- Come on, Grandpa.

601
00:45:25,457 --> 00:45:29,711
Up you go, lazybones. Thought we'd get
the west-40 done before breakfast.

602
00:45:31,421 --> 00:45:34,382
Look at that. It's almost 4.45.
We must have overslept.

603
00:45:34,633 --> 00:45:36,801
Emma, Emma, Emma!

604
00:45:37,052 --> 00:45:42,057
- Good morning, Emma.
- Good morning, corn child.

605
00:45:45,810 --> 00:45:49,689
This is Molly and this is Mae.

606
00:45:51,358 --> 00:45:53,526
Two good, honest workers.

607
00:45:53,777 --> 00:45:56,821
Though Molly gave me a big scare
last week, didn't you, girl?

608
00:45:57,072 --> 00:45:59,491
Have a look at her pastern.

609
00:46:07,457 --> 00:46:11,086
Oh. I see what you mean.

610
00:46:12,295 --> 00:46:14,631
No, her pastern.

611
00:46:18,969 --> 00:46:21,054
I thought you said ass burn.

612
00:46:23,014 --> 00:46:26,935
- Pa, come quick!
- Sammy, leave him.

613
00:46:27,185 --> 00:46:30,397
Now, Jacob.
Here's where your expertise comes in.

614
00:46:31,523 --> 00:46:32,816
Huh?

615
00:46:34,317 --> 00:46:37,153
Strong bloodlines, perfect conformation.

616
00:46:37,404 --> 00:46:40,073
But he's the most ornery animal
I ever owned.

617
00:46:40,282 --> 00:46:42,951
Got him at auction three months ago.

618
00:46:43,201 --> 00:46:46,288
You may be the best horse trainer
in Missouri, Jacob,

619
00:46:46,538 --> 00:46:49,332
but even you could have trouble
with this one.

620
00:46:49,582 --> 00:46:52,002
Meet... Big John.

621
00:47:12,814 --> 00:47:15,358
Couldn't we just have
rice cakes for breakfast?

622
00:47:15,609 --> 00:47:18,403
Emma, these apples
are not for breakfast.

623
00:47:18,653 --> 00:47:21,406
They're for the schnitz pies
we'll be making.

624
00:47:21,656 --> 00:47:24,743
Oh, yeah.
There's nothing like a good schnitz pie.

625
00:47:27,329 --> 00:47:29,205
Emma, do you need some coffee?

626
00:47:29,456 --> 00:47:33,543
Coffee? This is
a coffee-drinking Ordnung?

627
00:47:33,793 --> 00:47:36,755
Oh, praise the Lord, sister.

628
00:47:37,005 --> 00:47:39,299
Mm.

629
00:47:43,637 --> 00:47:47,140
Mm. That is the most beautiful quilt
I've ever seen.

630
00:47:47,390 --> 00:47:50,226
Look at those colours.
It's just so vibrant and bold.

631
00:47:50,477 --> 00:47:53,271
And that stitching is so intricate.

632
00:47:54,481 --> 00:47:56,900
Whoever made this quilt
is quite the artist.

633
00:47:57,150 --> 00:48:00,111
Oh, Emma. That is the quilt you made.

634
00:48:00,362 --> 00:48:01,905
Ahem.

635
00:48:02,155 --> 00:48:04,824
Now that I'm looking at it,
it's not so swell.

636
00:48:05,033 --> 00:48:08,411
It's flawed. Maybe it's
just the way the light was hitting it.

637
00:48:08,662 --> 00:48:12,374
No, no. You truly are gifted
with the needle, Emma.

638
00:48:12,624 --> 00:48:14,584
All the women here are so excited

639
00:48:14,834 --> 00:48:18,088
to learn your double-cross
wedding ring pattern.

640
00:48:19,798 --> 00:48:22,884
- Beg pardon?
- I showed them all your samples.

641
00:48:31,559 --> 00:48:34,312
l'm golng back to the country

642
00:48:34,562 --> 00:48:36,147
l can't pay the rent

643
00:48:36,398 --> 00:48:40,026
No, l'm not completely broke
But, brother, l'm badly bent

644
00:48:40,277 --> 00:48:44,281
l can't understand where my money went

645
00:48:44,531 --> 00:48:49,536
Well, l aln't broke
But l'm badly bent

646
00:49:02,924 --> 00:49:04,801
When l get back to the country

647
00:49:05,051 --> 00:49:07,345
l'll be llvlng ln a tln

648
00:49:07,595 --> 00:49:10,724
Ma and Pa wlll surely mess
about how much money l've spent

649
00:49:10,974 --> 00:49:15,353
Can't understand just where lt went

650
00:49:15,603 --> 00:49:20,442
Well, l aln't broke
But l'm badly bent

651
00:49:25,530 --> 00:49:27,782
Back up.

652
00:49:39,753 --> 00:49:43,131
And l don't know just where lt went

653
00:49:44,049 --> 00:49:47,886
Well, l aln't broke
But l'm badly bent

654
00:49:48,136 --> 00:49:52,223
Can't understand where my money went

655
00:49:52,474 --> 00:49:58,021
Well, l aln't broke
But, brother, l'm badly bent d

656
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:16,164
Um... hip-hup.

657
00:50:16,414 --> 00:50:19,000
Move it on, Big John.

658
00:50:19,250 --> 00:50:22,587
Come on, now. Go now.
We gotta go. We gotta get going.

659
00:50:26,925 --> 00:50:28,927
Easy for you!

660
00:50:30,637 --> 00:50:32,222
Coh! Ow!

661
00:50:32,472 --> 00:50:34,349
Whoa! Whoa!

662
00:50:34,599 --> 00:50:37,185
Whoa, John! John, yo-ho!

663
00:50:37,435 --> 00:50:40,230
John! Whoa, we are ploughing now!

664
00:50:53,576 --> 00:50:55,912
Kissed by the sun today,
hey, Cousin Jacob?

665
00:50:56,162 --> 00:50:58,665
Ouch.

666
00:50:58,915 --> 00:51:02,919
Well, I must say we are blessed
to have you here for spring planting.

667
00:51:03,169 --> 00:51:07,924
- Another man makes all the difference.
- Well, I'm just happy to be here.

668
00:51:08,174 --> 00:51:11,511
Maybe tomorrow Big John
will give in to your training techniques

669
00:51:11,761 --> 00:51:15,265
- and you can start on the north-20.
- Huh?

670
00:51:15,515 --> 00:51:18,435
- Excited, huh?
- Very.

671
00:51:22,814 --> 00:51:26,151
- Are you hungry, Jacob?
- As a matter of fact, I am, Emma.

672
00:51:26,401 --> 00:51:28,903
Emma made your very favourite dish.

673
00:51:29,154 --> 00:51:30,280
Mm.

674
00:51:30,530 --> 00:51:36,036
- You don't know how to cook.
- Liver, kidney and lung casserole.

675
00:51:42,626 --> 00:51:44,544
Oh.

676
00:51:44,794 --> 00:51:47,839
Oh, look at that.

677
00:51:48,089 --> 00:51:52,385
Eat up, Jacob. You're gonna need
your strength tomorrow, honey.

678
00:52:14,574 --> 00:52:16,868
Wow. Lipstick for me?

679
00:52:17,118 --> 00:52:19,120
Oh, honey.

680
00:52:19,371 --> 00:52:21,206
You look beat.

681
00:52:21,456 --> 00:52:24,709
Let me draw you a bath.

682
00:52:27,045 --> 00:52:30,840
- lndigestion?
- Don't remember eating that.

683
00:52:31,091 --> 00:52:33,051
Guess what.

684
00:52:34,094 --> 00:52:36,096
Emma doesn't have to cook tomorrow.

685
00:52:37,263 --> 00:52:40,934
Guess what. Jacob may not let her live
to see tomorrow.

686
00:52:41,184 --> 00:52:43,979
Do me the favour.
Do you know what I did all day long?

687
00:52:44,229 --> 00:52:46,731
I was on my hands and knees
scrubbing floors.

688
00:52:46,982 --> 00:52:49,693
What is that? Violins?
Can you hear them?

689
00:52:49,943 --> 00:52:52,779
What about me? How about
ploughing on a woolly mammoth?

690
00:52:53,029 --> 00:52:55,740
- Seen the size of that horse?
- Did you call Phil?

691
00:52:55,991 --> 00:52:58,076
Yes. I used the windmill phone.

692
00:52:58,326 --> 00:53:02,497
- Town is five miles away.
- Why don't you make a few more excuses?

693
00:53:02,747 --> 00:53:04,541
I thought we were passing through.

694
00:53:04,791 --> 00:53:08,795
I didn't know I was gonna spend the rest
of my life at Yoder State Penitentiary.

695
00:53:09,045 --> 00:53:10,922
- I'll call him tomorrow!
- Fine.

696
00:53:21,683 --> 00:53:24,102
I'm exhausted.

697
00:53:40,410 --> 00:53:43,455
Please tell me
that's not what I think it is.

698
00:53:43,705 --> 00:53:47,834
- Where do they get the energy?
- Must be from those schnitz pies.

699
00:53:49,294 --> 00:53:51,338
Certainly not one of your schnitz pies.

700
00:53:56,509 --> 00:53:59,179
Thank God. They're quick.

701
00:54:02,891 --> 00:54:06,186
Like somebody else I know.

702
00:54:18,031 --> 00:54:20,200
Morning!

703
00:54:22,535 --> 00:54:24,871
Look, it's already quarter to five!

704
00:54:26,414 --> 00:54:28,792
Coh. Wow.

705
00:54:29,042 --> 00:54:32,921
That's a pretty big number.
Are you gentlemen sure this is correct?

706
00:54:33,171 --> 00:54:36,800
We do tend to frown on
excessive write-offs, sir.

707
00:54:37,050 --> 00:54:40,303
I'd love to help you guys,
but I'm completely in the dark here.

708
00:54:41,638 --> 00:54:43,848
Well. Then here's a little light.

709
00:54:44,933 --> 00:54:48,019
lf I find out you're not acting
in complete cooperation...

710
00:54:48,269 --> 00:54:51,314
Believe me,
I don't need any trouble with the IRS.

711
00:54:51,564 --> 00:54:55,735
You don't know how right you are,
Mr Fancy-Desk.

712
00:54:59,030 --> 00:55:01,574
lf you hear from 'em, give us a call.

713
00:55:04,995 --> 00:55:07,038
"Mr Fancy-Desk"?

714
00:55:07,289 --> 00:55:09,332
What an asshole.

715
00:55:09,582 --> 00:55:12,043
Let's get a good, old-fashioned
tap on his line.

716
00:55:12,294 --> 00:55:15,505
- Can we do that?
- We're the IRS. We do anything we want.

717
00:55:15,755 --> 00:55:18,133
- Sir?
- Trust me, son. I know cheaters.

718
00:55:18,383 --> 00:55:21,511
The Sextons are kicking back
in some fancy Caribbean resort,

719
00:55:21,761 --> 00:55:24,723
slugging drinks
and copulating in unconventional ways.

720
00:55:24,973 --> 00:55:26,891
They're having a great time.

721
00:55:31,021 --> 00:55:33,523
That's it!

722
00:55:39,112 --> 00:55:41,698
Know what I'm thinking about
right now, Big John?

723
00:55:41,948 --> 00:55:44,659
Glue.
And I'm not talking about white glue.

724
00:55:44,909 --> 00:55:48,288
I'm talking about stick glue.

725
00:55:48,538 --> 00:55:51,541
Gosh, where does glue come from?
Anybody?

726
00:55:51,791 --> 00:55:53,918
Your feet!

727
00:55:54,169 --> 00:55:56,838
It's pretty simple, pal.

728
00:55:57,088 --> 00:56:01,968
Be submissive... or be adhesive.

729
00:56:03,637 --> 00:56:07,223
You're a plough horse.
There's nothing wrong with that.

730
00:56:07,474 --> 00:56:10,810
Show some self-respect.
They're talking about you in the barn.

731
00:56:11,061 --> 00:56:13,480
Molly and Mae. I heard them.

732
00:56:13,730 --> 00:56:15,857
"Coh, that Big John. What a stud."

733
00:56:16,107 --> 00:56:19,444
"High in the rear,
and check out his pastern."

734
00:56:20,403 --> 00:56:22,238
Johnny, Johnny, Johnny!

735
00:56:23,239 --> 00:56:26,576
Don't be a failure
the rest of your life. No.

736
00:56:27,661 --> 00:56:30,413
Let's till the soil.

737
00:56:33,249 --> 00:56:36,419
I didn't mean to yell. I was venting.

738
00:56:36,670 --> 00:56:38,922
Let it go. Let it go.

739
00:56:42,676 --> 00:56:46,221
All right, Big John.
You and me and the dirt.

740
00:56:48,431 --> 00:56:50,433
Hi-dee-ho. Let's go.

741
00:56:58,817 --> 00:57:01,695
Oh, no, honey.
Sweetie, go back home. Shoo. Shoo.

742
00:57:03,863 --> 00:57:06,408
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Whoa, whoa.

743
00:57:06,658 --> 00:57:09,035
All right. Caroline!

744
00:57:10,537 --> 00:57:14,165
- I'm ploughing!
- Yee-haw, Brad.

745
00:57:14,416 --> 00:57:18,586
Bet these people don't get a chance
to see the zig-zag pattern very often.

746
00:57:18,837 --> 00:57:23,174
You know... I think
I'm really getting the hang of this.

747
00:57:23,425 --> 00:57:26,261
That's great, Mr Green Jeans.

748
00:57:26,511 --> 00:57:28,513
ls that for me?

749
00:57:30,932 --> 00:57:33,518
- Thank you.
- Don't read anything into it.

750
00:57:34,728 --> 00:57:38,064
You said you'd call Phil today,
so could you go make the call?

751
00:57:38,315 --> 00:57:41,401
I'm ready to exit the 19th Century.

752
00:57:41,651 --> 00:57:43,945
And could you get me
a carton of cigarettes

753
00:57:44,195 --> 00:57:46,364
and some Extra Strength Tylenol?

754
00:57:47,657 --> 00:57:50,201
What? Aren't you going?

755
00:57:50,452 --> 00:57:53,830
I can't go. I promised Samuel
I'd plough the rest of this field.

756
00:57:54,080 --> 00:57:56,499
Oh! I have got to get out of here!

757
00:57:56,750 --> 00:57:59,961
They've got me paring
and pickling and plucking.

758
00:58:00,211 --> 00:58:03,465
And that annoying little girl
follows me everywhere I go.

759
00:58:03,715 --> 00:58:06,301
You know what?
Prison couldn't be worse than this.

760
00:58:07,469 --> 00:58:09,512
Would you stop complaining?

761
00:58:09,763 --> 00:58:13,391
Oh, now what?
You're taking the horse to town?

762
00:58:13,642 --> 00:58:16,019
No, I think I'll take the subway.

763
00:58:16,269 --> 00:58:19,981
Brad, you cannot ride that thing.

764
00:58:21,524 --> 00:58:25,403
This is not a thing, Caroline.
This is a horse.

765
00:58:25,654 --> 00:58:30,617
His name is Big John. And he and l
have come to an understanding.

766
00:58:30,867 --> 00:58:32,827
I hope the two of you
will be very happy.

767
00:58:33,078 --> 00:58:36,706
- I need some help getting up.
- Are you serious?

768
00:58:36,957 --> 00:58:39,209
Could be.

769
00:58:40,669 --> 00:58:43,213
Give me your foot. Jump!

770
00:58:48,802 --> 00:58:51,096
Hey. I'll need my hat.

771
00:58:51,346 --> 00:58:53,181
- Oh.
- All right.

772
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:57,894
All right, Johnny. Let's go to town.

773
00:59:03,066 --> 00:59:06,027
You know where town is?
Come on, you're making me look bad.

774
00:59:06,278 --> 00:59:08,446
- Allow me.
- What?

775
00:59:10,949 --> 00:59:14,244
Whoa, whoa! Johnny, Johnny!
Come on, John. OK.

776
00:59:14,494 --> 00:59:17,163
Don't forget my cigarettes!

777
00:59:23,086 --> 00:59:24,963
Don't tell me.
I can't know where you are.

778
00:59:25,213 --> 00:59:26,923
- But, Phil!
- Careful!

779
00:59:27,173 --> 00:59:30,427
I'm sure they've tapped the line.
Hiya, fellas. How are tricks?

780
00:59:30,677 --> 00:59:33,054
I know how these morons operate.

781
00:59:33,305 --> 00:59:35,056
Phil, dld you get hold of Lachman?

782
00:59:35,307 --> 00:59:38,727
No, not yet. But I did manage
to get a copy of your returns.

783
00:59:38,977 --> 00:59:42,063
Very interesting reading.
Brad, when did you buy a jet?

784
00:59:42,314 --> 00:59:45,358
- I don't have a jet.
- Well, you deducted one.

785
00:59:45,609 --> 00:59:48,945
- And what about this...
- How big a schooner?

786
00:59:51,406 --> 00:59:53,533
Phil, you don't believe
this shit, do you?

787
00:59:53,783 --> 00:59:56,494
- Should l?
- Lachman!

788
00:59:56,745 --> 00:59:59,039
Brad, calm down or I can't help you.

789
00:59:59,289 --> 01:00:04,210
I'm so sorry. I've just spent the last
day getting my ass kicked by Big John.

790
01:00:04,461 --> 01:00:06,463
Brad, no namesl

791
01:00:06,713 --> 01:00:08,798
I've got a few ideas.
Let me do my magic.

792
01:00:09,049 --> 01:00:13,094
- I'll get back to you in a week or two.
- Or two?!

793
01:00:13,345 --> 01:00:16,222
Two? Phil. Phil. Phil.
Shit!

794
01:00:16,473 --> 01:00:18,642
Finally, the break we needed.

795
01:00:18,892 --> 01:00:22,812
Get the files on every gangster in
the western hemisphere named Big John.

796
01:00:23,063 --> 01:00:24,314
Every one.

797
01:00:28,318 --> 01:00:30,320
Jacob.

798
01:00:30,570 --> 01:00:32,322
Uh... Jacob.

799
01:00:33,740 --> 01:00:36,326
Yes. Just call me Jake, Henner.

800
01:00:36,576 --> 01:00:39,829
Uh... Jake, could you spare a minute?

801
01:00:41,957 --> 01:00:44,918
- Does it involve any heavy lifting?
- No.

802
01:00:45,168 --> 01:00:46,878
Good. What do you want?

803
01:00:47,128 --> 01:00:50,173
Uh... you know um...
here in our Ordnung,

804
01:00:50,423 --> 01:00:53,093
men don't speak much
about certain things.

805
01:00:53,301 --> 01:00:55,428
Actually, they don't speak much period.

806
01:00:55,679 --> 01:00:59,724
Yeah. So I was hoping,
because your Ordnung is so liberal,

807
01:00:59,975 --> 01:01:02,060
that I could ask you about, um...

808
01:01:02,310 --> 01:01:04,896
I could, uh... For example, um...

809
01:01:05,146 --> 01:01:08,692
Henner. Henner. Come on. Take a break.
What do you want to ask me?

810
01:01:08,942 --> 01:01:10,986
Um... women?

811
01:01:12,529 --> 01:01:14,322
Vimmin?

812
01:01:14,572 --> 01:01:16,658
- Women.
- Vermin?

813
01:01:16,908 --> 01:01:18,159
No! Women!

814
01:01:18,410 --> 01:01:20,620
- Vimmin.
- Women!

815
01:01:20,870 --> 01:01:21,871
- Women!
- Women!

816
01:01:22,122 --> 01:01:24,124
OK. What do you want to know?

817
01:01:24,374 --> 01:01:26,543
Marriage.

818
01:01:26,793 --> 01:01:28,586
Oh.

819
01:01:30,046 --> 01:01:32,257
- You and Rebecca?
- Ja.

820
01:01:32,507 --> 01:01:34,217
See, I think about it constantly.

821
01:01:34,467 --> 01:01:37,178
I'm practising,
I'm preparing what I'm going to say.

822
01:01:37,429 --> 01:01:41,599
I see her and the words leave my head
and l... Something's wrong with me.

823
01:01:41,850 --> 01:01:46,438
Nothing's wrong with you. Women do that
to men. It's called being in love.

824
01:01:46,688 --> 01:01:52,652
But in our Ordnung, you cannot marry
without at least two years of courting.

825
01:01:52,902 --> 01:01:54,446
Ah, and you want to jump the gun.

826
01:01:54,696 --> 01:01:58,325
Take the plunge. Buy the cow.

827
01:01:58,575 --> 01:02:01,244
ldioms aren't your thing, are they?

828
01:02:01,494 --> 01:02:04,748
- You want to get married right away.
- Yes!

829
01:02:04,998 --> 01:02:07,125
Yay-hey!

830
01:02:07,375 --> 01:02:11,755
But, uh... Well, um... How long
did you court before you were married?

831
01:02:14,466 --> 01:02:17,218
- Six weeks.
- You were married after six weeks?

832
01:02:18,303 --> 01:02:20,555
But, oh, seemed like two years.

833
01:02:22,724 --> 01:02:26,227
And we really, really loved each other.

834
01:02:27,395 --> 01:02:29,272
So Emma was all you could think about.

835
01:02:29,522 --> 01:02:32,692
You wanted nothing more than
to be in her company every moment,

836
01:02:32,943 --> 01:02:35,528
all of the day and... the night?

837
01:02:36,696 --> 01:02:39,240
lncredibly... yes.

838
01:02:39,491 --> 01:02:42,452
All that is needed is love!
I knew this!

839
01:02:42,702 --> 01:02:46,081
I knew this in my heart,
but I was afraid to defy the elders.

840
01:02:46,331 --> 01:02:49,834
Uh, uh, uh. Don't defy on account of me.

841
01:02:50,085 --> 01:02:55,006
Thank you, Jacob. Thank you
for your strength and your wisdom.

842
01:02:57,550 --> 01:02:59,678
Great. Save this for the honeymoon,
OK?

843
01:03:01,638 --> 01:03:03,264
Thank you.

844
01:03:05,642 --> 01:03:08,103
What do you mean we have to stay here?

845
01:03:08,353 --> 01:03:10,605
- Keep your voice down, Emma.
- I will not!

846
01:03:10,855 --> 01:03:12,816
And stop calling me Emma!

847
01:03:13,066 --> 01:03:15,777
- Did you get my cigarettes?
- No one will find us here.

848
01:03:16,027 --> 01:03:18,738
And it's not that bad.
We get free food, free lodging.

849
01:03:18,989 --> 01:03:20,865
Free food, my ass!

850
01:03:21,116 --> 01:03:23,868
I've never worked so hard in my life
for a meal.

851
01:03:24,119 --> 01:03:26,621
- Keep your voice down.
- I won't keep my voice down.

852
01:03:26,871 --> 01:03:30,250
I don't understand. Two days ago,
you and I were getting a divorce,

853
01:03:30,500 --> 01:03:32,377
and finally I was gonna be rid of you.

854
01:03:32,627 --> 01:03:36,214
I don't have to stay here another day.
Do you hear me... Jacob?

855
01:03:36,464 --> 01:03:38,550
Fine... Emma!

856
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:44,347
Do what you want. Leave.
Pack your bags and leave!

857
01:03:44,597 --> 01:03:46,391
- Fine.
- Ha-ha.

858
01:03:46,641 --> 01:03:48,435
Coh!

859
01:03:54,190 --> 01:03:57,402
- You were right.
- Marital discord.

860
01:03:57,652 --> 01:03:59,487
It's such a shame.

861
01:03:59,738 --> 01:04:03,867
Must be why they came early,
hoping a change would make a difference.

862
01:04:05,493 --> 01:04:09,497
My mother's
200-year-old porcelain pitcher.

863
01:04:09,748 --> 01:04:12,542
God has sent them to us, Levinia.

864
01:04:12,792 --> 01:04:16,546
I'm not sure how we can help them,
but we must try.

865
01:04:22,510 --> 01:04:24,763
- Jacob?
- Evening, Samuel.

866
01:04:27,057 --> 01:04:31,603
- We need to speak.
- OK. About what?

867
01:04:31,853 --> 01:04:34,397
You don't think we know what's going on?

868
01:04:42,155 --> 01:04:44,824
I didn't mean to put your family
in the middle of this.

869
01:04:46,451 --> 01:04:49,663
Truth is, we were desperate.

870
01:04:49,913 --> 01:04:52,123
Up you-know-what-creek
without a paddle.

871
01:04:52,374 --> 01:04:55,043
- Shit creek?
- That's the one.

872
01:04:56,586 --> 01:04:59,589
I don't know what to say.
Look, I'm sorry.

873
01:04:59,839 --> 01:05:01,925
I know what I did was wrong.

874
01:05:02,175 --> 01:05:06,721
We were just so scared.
Everything just started to snowball.

875
01:05:06,972 --> 01:05:11,893
- We needed a place to hide.
- You mustn't hide from your problems.

876
01:05:12,143 --> 01:05:16,439
You must confront them. lf you turn
your back, they'll only get bigger.

877
01:05:16,690 --> 01:05:19,943
You must show no fear
and stand in their way.

878
01:05:20,193 --> 01:05:22,946
That's not easy
when you're facing prison, Samuel.

879
01:05:23,196 --> 01:05:26,950
Marriage is hardly
a prison sentence, Jacob.

880
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:29,452
Marriage?

881
01:05:30,578 --> 01:05:34,207
My marriage?
Prison was too strong a word.

882
01:05:34,457 --> 01:05:39,296
I meant sometimes
it makes me feel... claustrophobic.

883
01:05:39,546 --> 01:05:41,047
Huh?

884
01:05:42,090 --> 01:05:48,430
Well, all husbands and wives have
periods of disagreement and heartache.

885
01:05:48,680 --> 01:05:51,349
But the harsh words. The evil looks.

886
01:05:51,599 --> 01:05:55,186
You don't want to live like that
the rest of your days, do you?

887
01:05:55,437 --> 01:05:58,815
Oh, Levinia, do we have to do this?

888
01:05:59,065 --> 01:06:04,404
The vow of marriage. The love.
These aren't just words, Cousin.

889
01:06:04,613 --> 01:06:08,825
It's the commitment we live by
and hold second only to God.

890
01:06:12,120 --> 01:06:16,082
So that would make God first, right?

891
01:06:19,210 --> 01:06:22,255
Remember, you wrote
about your picnics by the lake,

892
01:06:22,505 --> 01:06:25,258
mating in the barn with wild abandon.

893
01:06:27,385 --> 01:06:30,388
I'm afraid our barn-mating days
are long gone.

894
01:06:30,639 --> 01:06:34,684
It's been a long time since
she opened her barn for me, Samuel.

895
01:06:34,934 --> 01:06:37,187
But every day can be a new beginning.

896
01:06:37,437 --> 01:06:39,147
That's the beauty of marriage.

897
01:06:39,397 --> 01:06:41,650
Look inside your heart, Jacob.

898
01:06:41,900 --> 01:06:43,818
And put hers above your own.

899
01:06:44,069 --> 01:06:47,822
Once you've settled in,
you won't have time to be sad.

900
01:06:48,073 --> 01:06:50,659
Now. Let's go scrub the kitchen floor.

901
01:06:50,909 --> 01:06:54,287
Oh, could we? Gee!

902
01:06:54,537 --> 01:06:58,875
Samuel, thanks for the talk. I feel
better now it's all out in the open.

903
01:07:03,588 --> 01:07:05,840
You got a heck of a grip on you, Samuel.

904
01:07:08,134 --> 01:07:10,470
Big John, "The Chameleon". Dead.

905
01:07:11,638 --> 01:07:15,850
Big John, "The Cockroach".
Turned state's evidence.

906
01:07:16,101 --> 01:07:19,270
Big Johnny, "Cool Oat".
Serving nine life sentences.

907
01:07:19,521 --> 01:07:24,734
Not so cool any more. Stick with it,
son. I will not be made a fool of.

908
01:07:24,985 --> 01:07:26,861
- Too late.
- How's that?

909
01:07:27,112 --> 01:07:29,864
- I said I'll be working late.
- Good man.

910
01:07:56,558 --> 01:07:58,685
Morning.

911
01:07:58,935 --> 01:08:00,478
Uh...

912
01:08:05,483 --> 01:08:09,696
Oh, God! Don't these people
believe in shock absorbers?

913
01:08:09,946 --> 01:08:13,575
Just try to enjoy the ride!
Look at this carriage. 100 years old.

914
01:08:13,825 --> 01:08:17,245
Looks brand-new. You don't see
quality like this any more.

915
01:08:18,455 --> 01:08:20,790
God. You've crossed over.

916
01:08:21,041 --> 01:08:23,126
You're one of them now.

917
01:08:23,376 --> 01:08:26,379
Every day's a reminder
that I don't know how to do anything.

918
01:08:26,630 --> 01:08:30,091
- You're feeling sorry for yourself.
- No, I'm not.

919
01:08:30,342 --> 01:08:32,427
These women know how to do everything.

920
01:08:32,677 --> 01:08:34,721
Hell, I can't even cook or sew.

921
01:08:34,971 --> 01:08:37,182
I'm domestically challenged.

922
01:08:37,432 --> 01:08:39,351
That's funny!

923
01:08:39,601 --> 01:08:42,270
No, it's not. It's not funny at all.

924
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:44,522
I feel so useless here.

925
01:08:44,773 --> 01:08:47,359
We can do this.

926
01:08:48,610 --> 01:08:50,570
Do you still know how
to work a party?

927
01:08:50,820 --> 01:08:51,947
Yes.

928
01:08:52,197 --> 01:08:54,699
- All right. Fine. Let's go.
- All right.

929
01:08:54,950 --> 01:08:56,993
Come on. Here we go.

930
01:09:16,805 --> 01:09:18,807
Having fun, Emma?

931
01:09:20,308 --> 01:09:23,770
They're all dressed alike
and they're still having a good time.

932
01:09:24,020 --> 01:09:27,023
You didn't all
wear the same thing back home?

933
01:09:28,275 --> 01:09:30,610
Liberal Ordnung.

934
01:09:30,860 --> 01:09:32,862
Liberal Ordnung.

935
01:09:33,113 --> 01:09:35,865
Back in Missouri,
you probably wore many colours.

936
01:09:36,116 --> 01:09:38,368
- Perhaps even different styles?
- Yeah.

937
01:09:38,618 --> 01:09:42,497
Your Ordnung and so many others have
become much less rigid in that area.

938
01:09:42,747 --> 01:09:44,666
But here, we're still very limited.

939
01:09:44,916 --> 01:09:48,962
Our Leadership Council has taken
the colour issue under consideration.

940
01:09:49,212 --> 01:09:54,050
They always vote no. They say
these are colours. The only colours.

941
01:09:55,510 --> 01:09:57,887
Well, I'm sorry,
but I think it's ridiculous.

942
01:09:58,138 --> 01:10:00,223
Black is the timeless classic,

943
01:10:00,473 --> 01:10:04,269
but what's wrong with wearing pastels
and soft earth tones?

944
01:10:04,519 --> 01:10:07,856
We wear colour
and still maintain group conformity.

945
01:10:09,149 --> 01:10:12,986
Emma, this is the first moment
since you arrived that...

946
01:10:13,236 --> 01:10:15,905
Well, the subject seems
to bring out a fire in you.

947
01:10:16,656 --> 01:10:19,034
I have to admit, clothes are my passion.

948
01:10:20,035 --> 01:10:21,828
After the Lord, of course.

949
01:10:23,371 --> 01:10:27,959
We all share your feeling. Colour is
present in everything else God touches.

950
01:10:28,209 --> 01:10:30,128
So why not what we wear?

951
01:10:30,378 --> 01:10:32,714
The Council meets next week.

952
01:10:32,964 --> 01:10:36,801
Perhaps you could help the elders
to change their minds.

953
01:10:41,765 --> 01:10:43,683
No. Me? Next week?

954
01:10:44,934 --> 01:10:48,396
Do you think I could make
a good impression on them?

955
01:10:48,647 --> 01:10:50,982
Oh, ja.

956
01:10:53,234 --> 01:10:54,986
Oh!

957
01:10:55,236 --> 01:10:59,574
Well, that was fun.
We'll have to do that again soon.

958
01:10:59,824 --> 01:11:01,660
I told you he was funny.

959
01:11:01,910 --> 01:11:03,870
- Emma. Emma?
- Mm.

960
01:11:04,120 --> 01:11:06,206
- I made this for you.
- Oh, no. Thank you.

961
01:11:06,456 --> 01:11:10,335
No. Chocolate and I just aren't...

962
01:11:12,462 --> 01:11:14,381
I have an addiction.

963
01:11:18,551 --> 01:11:20,470
Oh, all right.

964
01:11:22,430 --> 01:11:25,433
Mm. Oh, Lord.

965
01:11:25,684 --> 01:11:28,144
- Emma, are you praying?
- Mm-hm.

966
01:11:28,395 --> 01:11:30,897
I'm praying that I can stop eating this.

967
01:11:32,983 --> 01:11:34,901
Thank you.

968
01:11:36,194 --> 01:11:38,863
Hello.

969
01:11:39,072 --> 01:11:40,573
Hm.

970
01:11:40,824 --> 01:11:42,826
- I think she likes you.
- Mm.

971
01:11:43,076 --> 01:11:45,412
- I think you like her.
- No, no.

972
01:11:45,662 --> 01:11:47,539
She's just enamoured with me.

973
01:11:47,789 --> 01:11:50,542
She's never met
a chain-smoking chocoholic before.

974
01:11:50,792 --> 01:11:53,169
Wait a minute. Something's gonna happen.

975
01:11:53,420 --> 01:11:55,755
Something wonderful.

976
01:11:57,507 --> 01:11:59,843
I would like to marry your daughter.

977
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:10,770
Friends! Friends!

978
01:12:11,021 --> 01:12:12,939
I have an announcement.

979
01:12:15,483 --> 01:12:20,655
I would like to make known
that as of today, my daughter Rebecca...

980
01:12:20,905 --> 01:12:23,783
is engaged to wed Mr Henner Lapp.

981
01:12:26,244 --> 01:12:28,330
God bless them both.

982
01:12:29,956 --> 01:12:32,292
That is all.

983
01:12:34,919 --> 01:12:37,505
Well, I hope they'll be really happy.

984
01:12:41,926 --> 01:12:44,137
Why did we get married?

985
01:12:46,556 --> 01:12:51,311
I don't know. I guess we thought
it was a smart thing to do at the time.

986
01:12:53,313 --> 01:12:55,857
- You were working at Saks.
- Mm-hm.

987
01:12:56,107 --> 01:12:59,819
You came in and you were gonna buy
these really stupid-looking socks.

988
01:13:00,070 --> 01:13:02,113
I sold you a suit instead.

989
01:13:02,364 --> 01:13:04,574
I still have that suit.

990
01:13:04,824 --> 01:13:06,993
But you're right about those socks.

991
01:13:08,453 --> 01:13:13,917
So I went to Saks looking for socks
and I got a suit and some sex.

992
01:13:18,046 --> 01:13:20,632
You were really handsome.

993
01:13:20,882 --> 01:13:23,218
- I was really handsome?
- Are.

994
01:13:31,309 --> 01:13:33,728
But did you ever really love me?

995
01:13:39,651 --> 01:13:41,945
You mean like that?

996
01:13:45,490 --> 01:13:48,076
Did you ever love me like that?

997
01:13:49,536 --> 01:13:52,205
- It was a long time ago.
- Yeah.

998
01:13:52,455 --> 01:13:55,375
- Well, we were different people then.
- Yeah.

999
01:13:56,668 --> 01:13:59,254
These people sure know how to cut a rug.

1000
01:13:59,504 --> 01:14:04,551
Yeah. Out a rug. Weave a rug.
Beat a rug.

1001
01:14:10,140 --> 01:14:12,058
What if...

1002
01:14:13,351 --> 01:14:18,440
What if Jacob thought
he should want to dance with Emma?

1003
01:14:20,817 --> 01:14:24,404
You mean, for appearance' sake?

1004
01:14:25,822 --> 01:14:28,950
- Yeah.
- Oh. OK. Sure.

1005
01:14:29,200 --> 01:14:31,411
- OK. Good.
- Sure. OK.

1006
01:14:34,831 --> 01:14:37,917
Well, just start running,
I'll chase you.

1007
01:15:50,323 --> 01:15:53,118
- Whoa.
- You guys taking the day off?

1008
01:15:53,368 --> 01:15:57,247
No, we're going to make a transaction
with the English.

1009
01:15:57,497 --> 01:16:00,542
Samuel is going to help me
buy that 20 acres across from him.

1010
01:16:01,793 --> 01:16:05,588
A real estate transaction.
Did you get a geological on it?

1011
01:16:05,839 --> 01:16:07,799
Check the water and mineral content?

1012
01:16:08,049 --> 01:16:10,468
You might want to look at
the grade of that.

1013
01:16:10,719 --> 01:16:12,887
Any liens on the property?

1014
01:16:15,432 --> 01:16:18,268
You would maybe like to come with us?

1015
01:16:18,518 --> 01:16:21,730
Oh. Yeah,
I got a lot of shit to do around here.

1016
01:16:24,399 --> 01:16:26,484
Yeah, I would like to go, though.

1017
01:16:29,195 --> 01:16:31,906
Phil, you don't
believe this shit, do you?

1018
01:16:32,157 --> 01:16:34,659
I've heard this before.
You're wasting my time.

1019
01:16:34,909 --> 01:16:36,620
Listen.

1020
01:16:36,870 --> 01:16:39,581
It's German.

1021
01:16:39,831 --> 01:16:41,416
- "Ordnung"?
- Yes.

1022
01:16:41,666 --> 01:16:45,211
It refers to the closed communities
of the Mennonites, or the Amish.

1023
01:16:46,254 --> 01:16:49,966
Of course. They don't pay taxes.
Joint's probably lousy with cheaters.

1024
01:16:50,216 --> 01:16:52,427
Let's go. I'll drive.

1025
01:16:52,761 --> 01:16:56,097
Colour?! What is next?

1026
01:16:56,348 --> 01:16:58,600
Leave behind the horse and buggy?

1027
01:16:58,850 --> 01:17:00,769
Where will it end?

1028
01:17:01,019 --> 01:17:05,357
With all due respect, I hardly think
that our wearing colourful dresses

1029
01:17:05,607 --> 01:17:09,277
is going to lead to tattoos
or monster truck rallies.

1030
01:17:09,527 --> 01:17:11,905
ln the Bible, it is written,

1031
01:17:12,155 --> 01:17:16,201
"Women shall adorn themselves
with modesty and sobriety,

1032
01:17:16,451 --> 01:17:19,913
without braided hair or costly array."

1033
01:17:20,163 --> 01:17:24,459
But this isn't about vanity.
Or violating your... our beliefs.

1034
01:17:24,709 --> 01:17:27,295
This is simply...

1035
01:17:27,545 --> 01:17:29,839
May I approach the bench?

1036
01:17:30,090 --> 01:17:34,010
Our quilts, our blankets,
are vibrant and joyful.

1037
01:17:34,260 --> 01:17:38,515
And yet we are forced to wear
these little black, drab numbers.

1038
01:17:38,765 --> 01:17:41,518
Aren't there mornings
when you wake up and you think,

1039
01:17:41,768 --> 01:17:44,938
"Oh, I am just so in the mood
to wear pink"?

1040
01:17:48,191 --> 01:17:51,111
lf you would excuse us
for just a moment, please.

1041
01:17:51,361 --> 01:17:53,571
Oh, yes, sure. Go ahead. Discuss.

1042
01:17:53,822 --> 01:17:55,657
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

1043
01:18:03,790 --> 01:18:07,544
Could you perhaps gather for us
some samples of which you speak?

1044
01:18:07,794 --> 01:18:11,923
- Yes, sirs.
- The Council will meet again in a week,

1045
01:18:12,173 --> 01:18:14,843
at which time we will make our decision.

1046
01:18:15,093 --> 01:18:16,720
Wunderbarl

1047
01:18:16,970 --> 01:18:19,097
lsn't that good?! One week?

1048
01:18:19,347 --> 01:18:22,684
Uh... Oh.
Ladies, we have shopping to do.

1049
01:18:22,934 --> 01:18:26,021
Thank you, gentlemen. Clao.

1050
01:18:32,777 --> 01:18:34,696
This price seems a bit high.

1051
01:18:34,946 --> 01:18:39,367
We'd love to make you a better deal.
We're sitting on... eight other offers?

1052
01:18:39,618 --> 01:18:42,746
Try ten, Jerry. But they're city folk.

1053
01:18:42,996 --> 01:18:46,458
You know, Samuel, we'd always rather
do business with you Amish.

1054
01:18:46,708 --> 01:18:49,628
This is a hell of a property
at a rock-bottom price.

1055
01:18:49,878 --> 01:18:53,006
It is much, much more
than we have in mind.

1056
01:18:53,256 --> 01:18:57,552
Hm. We're not making a dime on this one.
It's way below market.

1057
01:18:57,802 --> 01:19:01,681
- Well, what do you think, Jacob?
- I think, if it's OK with you two,

1058
01:19:01,931 --> 01:19:05,435
I'd like to talk to
these two fine gentlemen privately.

1059
01:19:06,519 --> 01:19:08,772
Please?

1060
01:19:13,193 --> 01:19:15,111
I'll be right out.

1061
01:19:16,404 --> 01:19:20,241
Mr Yoder, is this property perfect
for that boy, or what?

1062
01:19:20,492 --> 01:19:23,495
It's extraordinary
the way you people help each other out.

1063
01:19:23,745 --> 01:19:26,706
You're quiet and reserved.
You never cause any problems.

1064
01:19:26,957 --> 01:19:29,376
It's why we love doing business
with you Amish.

1065
01:19:29,626 --> 01:19:32,295
So hey, what can we do
to wrap this thing up?

1066
01:19:33,338 --> 01:19:36,967
For starters, you can take your offer,
wrap it in a tight little wad,

1067
01:19:37,217 --> 01:19:38,843
and shove it up your ass.

1068
01:19:40,679 --> 01:19:43,056
I thought I was a good negotiator.

1069
01:19:43,306 --> 01:19:47,060
To bring the English down that much.
Very impressive, Jacob.

1070
01:19:47,310 --> 01:19:50,605
It was nothing.
I'm just glad I could help.

1071
01:19:50,855 --> 01:19:54,025
And to think I am now responsible
for a piece of God's earth.

1072
01:19:54,276 --> 01:19:56,319
Wait till I tell Rebecca.

1073
01:19:56,569 --> 01:19:59,239
This is one of
the happiest days of my life.

1074
01:19:59,489 --> 01:20:02,158
- Thank you, brother Jacob.
- You bet.

1075
01:20:02,367 --> 01:20:04,244
Brothers, I'll be right back.

1076
01:20:06,288 --> 01:20:07,664
Thank you, father Samuel.

1077
01:20:09,457 --> 01:20:14,004
Yes, collect call from Jacob Yo...
No, no, no. Brad Sexton, please.

1078
01:20:15,046 --> 01:20:16,923
Thank you.

1079
01:20:21,011 --> 01:20:23,054
- Phil Kleinman's office.
- Hi, Evelyn.

1080
01:20:23,305 --> 01:20:26,516
- Is that you, Mr Sexton?
- Yes, it's me. Put Phil on the phone.

1081
01:20:26,766 --> 01:20:29,477
I'm sorry, Mr Sexton. He's out of town.

1082
01:20:29,728 --> 01:20:32,314
What do you mean, he's out of town?
Where did he go?

1083
01:20:32,564 --> 01:20:36,901
- I'm not allowed to say.
- Why, because somebody's listening?

1084
01:20:37,152 --> 01:20:39,237
I'm not allowed to say.

1085
01:20:39,487 --> 01:20:42,198
- What are you allowed to say?
- That's pretty much it.

1086
01:20:42,449 --> 01:20:44,075
Why don't you try back in a week?

1087
01:20:44,326 --> 01:20:46,703
Well, you tell...

1088
01:20:46,953 --> 01:20:48,622
Damn!

1089
01:20:48,872 --> 01:20:50,999
Broke at my farm.

1090
01:20:51,249 --> 01:20:55,337
- What did he say?
- I didn't think the Amish...

1091
01:20:59,966 --> 01:21:02,636
And you. Oh, this robin's egg blue.

1092
01:21:02,844 --> 01:21:04,846
Look at that.
Look how beautifuI that is.

1093
01:21:05,096 --> 01:21:08,725
- What's going on?
- Emma is quite a skilled shopper.

1094
01:21:08,975 --> 01:21:11,227
Well, she's had a lot of practice.

1095
01:21:11,478 --> 01:21:14,022
- Could I talk to you for a second?
- Sure.

1096
01:21:14,272 --> 01:21:16,066
You won't believe the selections.

1097
01:21:16,316 --> 01:21:19,778
I'm gonna use autumn tones.
The harvest is my muse, my inspiration.

1098
01:21:20,028 --> 01:21:21,696
And the prices are half...

1099
01:21:21,947 --> 01:21:25,617
Caroline, we're in trouble. Phil's gone.
He won't be back for a week.

1100
01:21:25,867 --> 01:21:28,370
- Why is he taking a week off?
- Well, how do I know?

1101
01:21:28,620 --> 01:21:32,457
That's good! I need a week
to get my designs in order.

1102
01:21:32,707 --> 01:21:34,960
Your designs? Hello!

1103
01:21:37,253 --> 01:21:39,172
Caroline?

1104
01:21:40,674 --> 01:21:44,135
Oh, no. You've crossed over.

1105
01:21:44,386 --> 01:21:46,221
You've become one of us.

1106
01:21:46,471 --> 01:21:49,975
Brad, be serious.
These women really need my help.

1107
01:21:50,225 --> 01:21:52,686
This is what I always wanted to do.
I can do this.

1108
01:21:54,646 --> 01:21:58,817
Whoa, whoa, whoa. We don't like
getting our picture taken, please.

1109
01:21:59,067 --> 01:22:00,902
I got you.

1110
01:22:01,152 --> 01:22:04,447
I understand.
Look, what's this gonna take, huh?

1111
01:22:04,698 --> 01:22:06,658
What do you need? Five bucks?

1112
01:22:06,908 --> 01:22:11,997
- A little Amish Lincoln?
- You need to show more respect.

1113
01:22:12,247 --> 01:22:14,124
What a dick.

1114
01:22:18,295 --> 01:22:20,297
- lntercourse, huh?
- Mm.

1115
01:22:22,173 --> 01:22:26,261
OK. You start in front, I'll come in
from behind and meet you in the middle.

1116
01:22:27,846 --> 01:22:29,723
Sounds good to me.

1117
01:23:44,798 --> 01:23:47,092
This is unbelievable.

1118
01:23:47,342 --> 01:23:49,678
Look at all these little guys.

1119
01:23:49,928 --> 01:23:55,058
I made them. Well, you know,
I planted them, and they're growing.

1120
01:23:55,308 --> 01:23:57,686
l, too, never grow tired of the miracle.

1121
01:23:57,936 --> 01:24:00,730
Well, it's... it's so honest.

1122
01:24:00,981 --> 01:24:06,069
I mean, you plough it, you plant it,
and it grows.

1123
01:24:06,319 --> 01:24:08,697
It's like they say...

1124
01:24:08,947 --> 01:24:10,907
you reap what you sow.

1125
01:24:11,157 --> 01:24:13,451
Aye, the process is so simple, isn't it?

1126
01:24:13,702 --> 01:24:17,872
The way things grow.
So quiet. So steady.

1127
01:24:18,123 --> 01:24:20,583
It's easy for people
to take things for granted.

1128
01:24:20,834 --> 01:24:23,503
The English, especially.
They view us as backward,

1129
01:24:23,712 --> 01:24:26,506
as hiding from reality.

1130
01:24:26,756 --> 01:24:29,968
But this is the reality.

1131
01:24:30,218 --> 01:24:33,930
This is the process of life.

1132
01:24:35,765 --> 01:24:40,353
We sow humility,
and we reap a great harvest.

1133
01:24:42,439 --> 01:24:45,025
It is not we who are hiding.

1134
01:24:48,320 --> 01:24:51,489
It's those English. Always hiding.

1135
01:24:57,370 --> 01:24:59,289
Jacob?

1136
01:25:29,527 --> 01:25:31,529
There. That's great.

1137
01:25:41,623 --> 01:25:43,833
Thanks a lot, guys.

1138
01:25:44,084 --> 01:25:46,211
Careful, Sammy. Stand back.

1139
01:25:46,461 --> 01:25:49,130
We talked about this, Big John.
It's your chance.

1140
01:25:49,381 --> 01:25:53,259
You're bigger than the stump. Think of
the girls in the barn. Hip-hip. Come on.

1141
01:25:57,681 --> 01:25:59,349
Come on, John.

1142
01:25:59,599 --> 01:26:01,393
You can do it, Jacob!

1143
01:26:01,643 --> 01:26:06,272
Come on, John! Come on! Come on, John!

1144
01:26:15,699 --> 01:26:16,908
Pull it, John. Come on.

1145
01:26:20,704 --> 01:26:22,789
Yeah!

1146
01:26:51,318 --> 01:26:54,738
Emma, I don't mean to sound prideful,
but how do I look?

1147
01:26:55,739 --> 01:26:58,992
Well, as long as
you don't tell anybody...

1148
01:27:00,702 --> 01:27:03,246
you look as pretty as the sunrise.

1149
01:27:07,042 --> 01:27:10,837
All right, everybody. All right.
Models, models, attention.

1150
01:27:11,087 --> 01:27:16,426
You... Heads up.
No modest, downcast eyes on the runway.

1151
01:27:16,676 --> 01:27:18,887
There we go. Now.

1152
01:27:19,137 --> 01:27:22,307
Think Versace, Armani, Valentino.

1153
01:27:25,310 --> 01:27:27,854
- Sears?
- Oh!

1154
01:27:28,104 --> 01:27:30,065
Are we ready?

1155
01:27:31,483 --> 01:27:34,736
I can't. I thought I could but I can't.

1156
01:27:34,986 --> 01:27:37,656
Henner! Get over it! You'll be fine.

1157
01:27:37,864 --> 01:27:40,075
But people will be staring at me.

1158
01:27:40,325 --> 01:27:42,243
But that's the point, Henner.

1159
01:27:45,246 --> 01:27:48,083
Oh! Henner!

1160
01:27:48,333 --> 01:27:51,211
Well. So much for my men's collection.

1161
01:27:51,461 --> 01:27:54,589
Henner! Henner, can you hear me?

1162
01:27:54,839 --> 01:27:57,050
Good afternoon, everyone.

1163
01:27:57,300 --> 01:28:00,470
Well, everywhere we look we see colour.

1164
01:28:00,720 --> 01:28:03,223
We've come together
in the spirit of simplicity

1165
01:28:03,473 --> 01:28:06,685
to honour the beautiful rainbow
which God has provided.

1166
01:28:06,935 --> 01:28:10,939
So sit back and enjoy,
as we celebrate the glory of nature

1167
01:28:11,189 --> 01:28:14,401
in Rainbow Harvest '97.

1168
01:28:14,651 --> 01:28:16,319
Hah.

1169
01:28:19,990 --> 01:28:21,950
Um... hit it.

1170
01:28:23,618 --> 01:28:24,828
And along comes Mary,

1171
01:28:25,078 --> 01:28:28,873
wearing a beautiful starburst quilt
across her bodice,

1172
01:28:29,124 --> 01:28:32,711
offset by subtle hues
of aubergine and brick.

1173
01:28:32,961 --> 01:28:36,381
This ensemble comes complete
with easy-access pockets.

1174
01:28:37,590 --> 01:28:40,719
Thank you, Mary.
Notice the fabric as she walks away.

1175
01:28:40,969 --> 01:28:44,556
It reminds me of corn,
swaying in the gentle summer breeze.

1176
01:28:44,806 --> 01:28:46,808
How about y'all?

1177
01:28:48,476 --> 01:28:51,938
Well, next we have Sarah.
Talk about versatility.

1178
01:28:52,188 --> 01:28:54,774
This quilted smock
in royal blue and rust

1179
01:28:55,025 --> 01:28:56,776
becomes an instant sporty classic,

1180
01:28:57,027 --> 01:29:00,196
appropriate at a barn dance
or on a milking stool.

1181
01:29:00,447 --> 01:29:04,242
Now you tell me.
What Amish girl could ask for more?

1182
01:29:04,492 --> 01:29:07,287
Excuse me, sir.
We're trying to locate these two people.

1183
01:29:07,537 --> 01:29:10,457
Can you please take a look
and see if you know them?

1184
01:29:10,707 --> 01:29:12,751
Thank you very much.

1185
01:29:15,128 --> 01:29:17,380
- We're getting nowhere with these.
- Yeah.

1186
01:29:17,631 --> 01:29:19,549
I just got an idea, sir.

1187
01:29:22,677 --> 01:29:24,095
Oh.

1188
01:29:24,346 --> 01:29:26,640
lnteresting approach. Here's another.

1189
01:29:26,890 --> 01:29:31,394
You see, my way, we double our chances
in half the time.

1190
01:29:35,690 --> 01:29:40,612
Don't be discouraged. It took years
before my mind started working this way.

1191
01:29:40,862 --> 01:29:45,033
Little Anna Yoder.
She's the picture of youthful exuberance

1192
01:29:45,283 --> 01:29:48,995
in her bright yellow sundress
and azure underlay,

1193
01:29:49,245 --> 01:29:52,123
making those baby blues just sparkle.

1194
01:29:52,374 --> 01:29:55,043
Doesn't it just scream
daffodils and sunflowers?

1195
01:29:57,212 --> 01:29:59,172
Or not?

1196
01:30:00,590 --> 01:30:02,217
Thank you.

1197
01:30:04,552 --> 01:30:07,889
- What happened to him?
- He couldn't take the pressure.

1198
01:30:08,139 --> 01:30:11,184
Emma was so disappointed.
He was to wear her men's colours.

1199
01:30:11,434 --> 01:30:14,729
Now we have Martha
in a very conservative number.

1200
01:30:15,605 --> 01:30:19,859
Now, I ask you a question.
ls she going to church or...

1201
01:30:21,444 --> 01:30:23,029
...to a picnic?

1202
01:30:23,280 --> 01:30:24,864
You tell me!

1203
01:30:25,115 --> 01:30:28,910
Wherever she's going,
she's gonna have a great time.

1204
01:30:29,160 --> 01:30:30,745
Thank you, Martha.

1205
01:30:30,996 --> 01:30:33,665
Um... I also have clothes for you men.

1206
01:30:33,873 --> 01:30:38,628
Unfortunately, male models being...
you know, what male models are...

1207
01:30:38,878 --> 01:30:41,423
Coh!

1208
01:30:46,928 --> 01:30:49,431
Here comes Jacob Yoder.

1209
01:30:49,681 --> 01:30:52,183
Whether he's on his way to town
to purchase grain,

1210
01:30:52,434 --> 01:30:54,311
or he's shearing his sheep,

1211
01:30:54,561 --> 01:30:57,731
he always looks his best
in his blueberry work shirt

1212
01:30:57,981 --> 01:31:01,192
and his blackberry suit.

1213
01:31:01,443 --> 01:31:03,486
Almost good enough to eat.

1214
01:31:05,238 --> 01:31:06,990
Thank you, Jacob.

1215
01:31:10,035 --> 01:31:12,162
Thank you, Jacob. Thank you.

1216
01:31:13,079 --> 01:31:15,790
Thanks, honey. Jacob!

1217
01:31:16,041 --> 01:31:17,959
Cool it!

1218
01:31:24,341 --> 01:31:27,719
And that concludes Rainbow Harvest '97.

1219
01:31:37,729 --> 01:31:40,857
- You're a brave soul, Jacob.
- I'll say. Very brave.

1220
01:31:41,107 --> 01:31:43,902
- It was nothing.
- You look very nice.

1221
01:31:44,152 --> 01:31:47,364
I just want to tell you,
no matter what the elders decide,

1222
01:31:47,614 --> 01:31:50,200
the clothes you made,
they are beautiful.

1223
01:31:50,450 --> 01:31:52,452
God has blessed you
with many talents.

1224
01:31:52,702 --> 01:31:55,997
Oh, thank you, but it wasn't just me.
I had my friends to help.

1225
01:31:56,247 --> 01:31:58,833
My real friends.

1226
01:31:59,084 --> 01:32:02,754
Um... Emma?
Um... I have a favour to ask.

1227
01:32:03,797 --> 01:32:07,884
I was wondering. Would you do me the
honour of helping us with the wedding?

1228
01:32:09,886 --> 01:32:13,223
- You want me to be the coordinator?
- Um... I guess so.

1229
01:32:13,473 --> 01:32:15,308
Yes! Yes!

1230
01:32:16,685 --> 01:32:18,770
- Good! Thank you!
- Ahem.

1231
01:32:20,981 --> 01:32:25,360
After much debate,
we have reached a decision.

1232
01:32:27,737 --> 01:32:30,657
We like the colours.

1233
01:32:42,794 --> 01:32:45,130
- Could I join you?
- Sure.

1234
01:32:47,257 --> 01:32:49,592
I know, I know.
Don't read anything into it.

1235
01:32:52,846 --> 01:32:55,557
I wanted to thank you
for helping me today, Jacob.

1236
01:32:57,142 --> 01:32:59,853
It was fun... Emma.

1237
01:33:01,187 --> 01:33:03,690
Do you want to sit down?

1238
01:33:03,940 --> 01:33:05,442
OK.

1239
01:33:11,948 --> 01:33:14,909
- I was really proud of you today.
- Mm.

1240
01:33:16,036 --> 01:33:19,080
Proud. That's gotta be a first.

1241
01:33:19,331 --> 01:33:22,334
No. You really helped those people.

1242
01:33:24,919 --> 01:33:28,298
You did something nice
just to do something nice.

1243
01:33:29,633 --> 01:33:32,636
- And you didn't even hire a publicist.
- Mm.

1244
01:33:32,886 --> 01:33:34,888
Yep. There you go.

1245
01:33:35,138 --> 01:33:37,807
I actually finished something.

1246
01:33:40,602 --> 01:33:43,521
And hey,
try and find an Amish publicist.

1247
01:33:47,233 --> 01:33:49,778
- You did good.
- Thank you.

1248
01:33:52,364 --> 01:33:54,574
And I know when you get out on your own,

1249
01:33:54,824 --> 01:33:58,036
whatever you do, you'll do great.

1250
01:33:58,286 --> 01:34:00,205
Mm. On my own.

1251
01:34:02,165 --> 01:34:04,209
There's a thought.

1252
01:34:06,294 --> 01:34:08,630
I'm sorry I held you back.

1253
01:34:10,131 --> 01:34:12,717
You didn't hold me back. No, you didn't.

1254
01:34:12,968 --> 01:34:16,096
I held myself back.

1255
01:34:16,346 --> 01:34:20,141
Hey, but hasn't it been great
not fighting with each other?

1256
01:34:22,560 --> 01:34:24,479
Yes.

1257
01:34:25,438 --> 01:34:28,817
It's too bad we didn't get
the hang of this a couple of years ago.

1258
01:34:29,067 --> 01:34:31,319
Yeah, that is too bad.

1259
01:34:32,320 --> 01:34:36,491
All those years chasing our tails,
for what?

1260
01:34:36,741 --> 01:34:39,035
Another car I didn't drive.

1261
01:34:39,286 --> 01:34:41,413
Another outfit I didn't wear.

1262
01:34:41,663 --> 01:34:45,542
The Holyland. ls that not
the worst idea you've ever heard?

1263
01:34:45,792 --> 01:34:48,169
Oh, Brad.

1264
01:34:48,420 --> 01:34:50,297
Yes.

1265
01:34:59,889 --> 01:35:02,475
You know, we can't stay here forever.

1266
01:35:05,186 --> 01:35:06,813
Yeah.

1267
01:35:11,109 --> 01:35:13,236
Look how bright the sky is.

1268
01:35:15,822 --> 01:35:18,700
It's so much clearer out here.

1269
01:35:20,577 --> 01:35:22,162
Yes, it is.

1270
01:35:58,907 --> 01:36:01,493
It was a wonderful day today, Samuel.

1271
01:36:01,743 --> 01:36:04,037
God only makes good days.

1272
01:36:24,724 --> 01:36:26,893
Afternoon.

1273
01:36:38,571 --> 01:36:42,409
Thanks to your semi-modern technology,
we've got bupkls.

1274
01:36:42,659 --> 01:36:46,288
lntercourse not paying off
doesn't mean your Dirty Harry technique

1275
01:36:46,538 --> 01:36:48,290
is better than forensic science.

1276
01:36:48,540 --> 01:36:52,794
ls that so? Well, who's got more movies,
Clint Eastwood or Jack Klugman?

1277
01:36:53,044 --> 01:36:55,297
- What?
- The only way to solve cases

1278
01:36:55,547 --> 01:36:59,843
is running down leads,
grilling suspects, long, lonely nights.

1279
01:37:00,093 --> 01:37:02,304
Sure, occasionally you come home

1280
01:37:02,554 --> 01:37:05,807
and your wife's in bed with
the bottled-water guy, but so what?

1281
01:37:06,057 --> 01:37:08,977
Boo-hoo, you blow your nose,
you move on.

1282
01:37:09,227 --> 01:37:12,105
Good old-fashioned police work
is the only way.

1283
01:37:13,356 --> 01:37:15,859
- Sir, look out!
- That's a cow.

1284
01:37:18,862 --> 01:37:20,572
That's a sign.

1285
01:37:31,458 --> 01:37:33,043
Hey.

1286
01:37:33,293 --> 01:37:36,880
On the other hand,
sometimes you just get lucky.

1287
01:37:38,840 --> 01:37:41,926
Sir, I think I messed myself.

1288
01:37:42,177 --> 01:37:44,429
Walk it off, son.

1289
01:37:45,472 --> 01:37:49,267
The vows you have taken,
you take for a lifetime.

1290
01:37:50,185 --> 01:37:52,646
These are promises
which you make to each other

1291
01:37:52,896 --> 01:37:57,108
with respect,
with kindness and fairness,

1292
01:37:58,318 --> 01:38:00,695
and with honour to each other,

1293
01:38:01,947 --> 01:38:05,742
with all lowliness, meekness,

1294
01:38:07,077 --> 01:38:09,955
forbearing one another in love,

1295
01:38:10,205 --> 01:38:14,000
endeavouring to hold
the unity of the spirit

1296
01:38:14,250 --> 01:38:16,920
with a bond of peace.

1297
01:38:17,128 --> 01:38:20,215
Neither time nor temperament
nor force of nature

1298
01:38:20,465 --> 01:38:24,886
shall diminish the solemnity
of this holy union in the eyes of God.

1299
01:38:25,136 --> 01:38:30,016
This commitment you make to each other
is sanctified in his name.

1300
01:38:31,309 --> 01:38:34,729
So will you, Rebecca,
take Henner to be your husband,

1301
01:38:34,980 --> 01:38:39,067
to love and to cherish, to honour
and obey till death do you part?

1302
01:38:39,317 --> 01:38:40,277
I will.

1303
01:38:40,527 --> 01:38:43,029
And do you, Henner,
take Rebecca to be your wife,

1304
01:38:43,280 --> 01:38:48,785
to love and to cherish, to honour
and obey, till death do you part?

1305
01:38:49,035 --> 01:38:51,121
- I will.
- So today,

1306
01:38:51,371 --> 01:38:56,418
before you friends, relatives,
brothers and sisters,

1307
01:38:56,668 --> 01:38:58,628
I offer you my blessings.

1308
01:39:55,685 --> 01:39:58,396
How do you tell them apart?
They all look alike to me.

1309
01:40:02,233 --> 01:40:04,027
OK, people.

1310
01:40:04,277 --> 01:40:06,363
We're looking for the Yoders.

1311
01:40:12,869 --> 01:40:14,663
That worked well.

1312
01:40:14,913 --> 01:40:18,833
- What is this about, please?
- It's about Jacob and Emma Yoder.

1313
01:40:19,084 --> 01:40:22,087
- Please.
- I am Jacob Yoder.

1314
01:40:22,337 --> 01:40:26,049
- And I am Emma.
- You are not. They are.

1315
01:40:26,299 --> 01:40:28,802
Aren't you, Jacob? Tell 'em.

1316
01:41:13,305 --> 01:41:15,432
Maybe we should ask
for a public defender.

1317
01:41:15,682 --> 01:41:17,767
Phil's office swore he'd be here.

1318
01:41:22,647 --> 01:41:24,399
Hi.

1319
01:41:24,649 --> 01:41:27,319
It's nice of them to come.

1320
01:41:27,569 --> 01:41:29,946
What on earth is she wearing?

1321
01:41:30,196 --> 01:41:33,366
Looks like something
from Mizrahi's milkmaid line.

1322
01:41:33,617 --> 01:41:36,411
- I like the no-button look.
- Yeah, you would.

1323
01:41:36,661 --> 01:41:38,747
How will Brad
dig his way out of this one?

1324
01:41:38,997 --> 01:41:42,751
- Looks like the Quaker defence.
- All rise.

1325
01:41:57,849 --> 01:42:01,478
- We're gonna get the chair.
- lf we're lucky.

1326
01:42:01,728 --> 01:42:04,022
Well, well, well.

1327
01:42:04,272 --> 01:42:08,318
Mr Sexton. And Mrs Sexton.

1328
01:42:08,568 --> 01:42:11,780
- It's good to see you, Your Honour.
- You're looking very well.

1329
01:42:13,156 --> 01:42:16,034
I should be shocked
at the list of charges against you,

1330
01:42:16,284 --> 01:42:21,081
but somehow it rings all too true.

1331
01:42:23,708 --> 01:42:26,002
ls Malik Ali Farquhvar here?

1332
01:42:26,252 --> 01:42:28,964
Yeah, that's me.
How you doin', Your Honour?

1333
01:42:29,214 --> 01:42:31,883
And I am definitely here.

1334
01:42:38,348 --> 01:42:41,351
Your Honour, I stole that man's taxi.

1335
01:42:42,811 --> 01:42:45,397
We stole that man's taxi.

1336
01:42:48,733 --> 01:42:51,695
And I know there's some questions
about our tax matters.

1337
01:42:51,945 --> 01:42:54,072
Mr Sexton, where is your attorney?

1338
01:42:54,656 --> 01:42:56,533
I don't know.

1339
01:42:56,783 --> 01:43:00,370
- Then who will represent the defence?
- There is no defence.

1340
01:43:00,620 --> 01:43:04,624
- We just want to be held accountable.
- We want to make things right.

1341
01:43:04,874 --> 01:43:07,711
You're prepared to accept
the consequences?

1342
01:43:07,961 --> 01:43:09,921
We are.

1343
01:43:11,756 --> 01:43:13,466
Your Honour.

1344
01:43:13,717 --> 01:43:15,802
Your Honour.

1345
01:43:17,804 --> 01:43:19,723
Mr Lincoln.

1346
01:43:20,682 --> 01:43:23,435
I'd like to apologise.
I just came from the airport.

1347
01:43:23,685 --> 01:43:26,354
Permission to approach the bench,
Your Honour.

1348
01:43:26,604 --> 01:43:28,481
Thank you.

1349
01:43:33,320 --> 01:43:36,114
Your Honour,
I've arranged for the extradition...

1350
01:43:39,451 --> 01:43:42,912
ln light of information which has
just been presented to the court,

1351
01:43:43,163 --> 01:43:44,914
we'll take a brief recess.

1352
01:43:50,503 --> 01:43:52,130
Look at the two of you.

1353
01:43:52,380 --> 01:43:55,050
- Where have you been, Phil?
- Zurich.

1354
01:43:55,258 --> 01:43:56,676
And I am pleased to report

1355
01:43:56,926 --> 01:43:59,721
that the long arm of the law
has triumphed once again.

1356
01:43:59,971 --> 01:44:03,266
You'll be billed accordingly. And...

1357
01:44:03,516 --> 01:44:05,143
I found Bob.

1358
01:44:14,152 --> 01:44:17,697
And as I was arranging
to extradite his considerable ass,

1359
01:44:17,948 --> 01:44:21,660
I did a little business with a
consortium of German investment bankers,

1360
01:44:21,910 --> 01:44:26,122
who flipped, absolutely flipped,
over the Holyland deal.

1361
01:44:26,373 --> 01:44:29,584
- They actually like it?
- Enough to buy you out.

1362
01:44:32,128 --> 01:44:34,714
Brad.

1363
01:44:34,965 --> 01:44:37,133
I'm sick. I'm a sick man.

1364
01:44:37,384 --> 01:44:40,387
l... I was jealous. I had debts.

1365
01:44:40,637 --> 01:44:43,223
I had needs. Very expensive needs.

1366
01:44:43,473 --> 01:44:46,434
The cutlery. The Tuscan villa.
The jet fuel.

1367
01:44:46,685 --> 01:44:49,354
The special shoes. I have webbed feet.

1368
01:44:49,604 --> 01:44:52,357
I never told you.
I didn't want to burden you.

1369
01:44:52,607 --> 01:44:55,735
I know you must hate my guts right now.

1370
01:44:59,364 --> 01:45:01,616
No, Bob, I don't.

1371
01:45:01,866 --> 01:45:04,536
- Actually, I owe you.
- Huh?

1372
01:45:04,786 --> 01:45:07,205
I owe you a debt of gratitude.

1373
01:45:07,455 --> 01:45:11,376
Yeah. You saved our lives
and you saved our marriage.

1374
01:45:11,626 --> 01:45:13,920
You mean you forgive me?

1375
01:45:15,005 --> 01:45:17,173
Well, I'd like to.

1376
01:45:20,427 --> 01:45:23,722
I guess I still have
a little ways to go.

1377
01:45:23,972 --> 01:45:25,890
Nice arm.

1378
01:45:28,560 --> 01:45:30,061
Case dismissed.

1379
01:45:40,488 --> 01:45:44,034
- Listen, Sexton, you're the man.
- Honey, what have you been eating?

1380
01:45:44,284 --> 01:45:47,829
Braddy boy, it's time to take
our relationship to the next level.

1381
01:45:48,079 --> 01:45:52,208
...my new pills. You'll love them.
They make everything taste like shit.

1382
01:45:52,459 --> 01:45:54,628
I am talking about a partnership here.

1383
01:45:54,878 --> 01:45:57,547
My brains, your financial brawn,
we can't miss.

1384
01:45:57,756 --> 01:45:59,466
Cigarette?

1385
01:45:59,716 --> 01:46:03,803
Gabriella's maid tried to kill herself
by climbing into the dishwasher.

1386
01:46:04,054 --> 01:46:07,807
Fabulous, huh? What do you say?

1387
01:47:01,987 --> 01:47:04,155
Hi!

1388
01:47:05,240 --> 01:47:07,367
How are you?

1389
01:47:20,797 --> 01:47:23,008
Anna, back in the house.

1390
01:47:32,309 --> 01:47:35,103
- Samuel, wait.
- Levinia, please.

1391
01:47:35,353 --> 01:47:38,398
We know what we did was very wrong.

1392
01:47:38,648 --> 01:47:42,110
We betrayed your trust and we hurt you.

1393
01:47:43,486 --> 01:47:46,364
I'd like to say
I wish this never happened

1394
01:47:46,615 --> 01:47:48,992
but I would be lying.

1395
01:47:49,242 --> 01:47:53,747
Coming here was the best thing
that's ever happened to us.

1396
01:47:53,997 --> 01:47:59,252
Where we live,
real friends are very hard to find.

1397
01:48:02,005 --> 01:48:06,468
Samuel, you told me to look
inside my heart to find forgiveness.

1398
01:48:08,178 --> 01:48:10,639
That's what we want you to do now.

1399
01:48:20,690 --> 01:48:23,193
For what it's worth, thank you.

1400
01:48:23,443 --> 01:48:26,112
I know I wasn't very good
at scrubbing floors,

1401
01:48:26,363 --> 01:48:28,865
but I really loved
spending time with you.

1402
01:48:33,995 --> 01:48:37,415
You English think you're so smart.

1403
01:48:40,085 --> 01:48:42,337
What?

1404
01:48:43,380 --> 01:48:46,132
Do you really think we didn't know?

1405
01:48:49,427 --> 01:48:50,553
Yes.

1406
01:48:50,804 --> 01:48:53,390
Then why didn't you say something?

1407
01:48:54,307 --> 01:48:55,934
Planting season.

1408
01:48:57,978 --> 01:49:00,772
We needed the extra help.

1409
01:49:02,107 --> 01:49:05,402
Besides, you looked like
you needed help, too.

1410
01:49:08,113 --> 01:49:12,075
But mostly... planting season.

1411
01:49:13,159 --> 01:49:15,120
Of course. The corn.

1412
01:49:18,164 --> 01:49:21,960
- Thank you.
- It's so good to see you.

1413
01:49:24,212 --> 01:49:28,008
Samuel, I still can't believe
I grew all this.

1414
01:49:28,258 --> 01:49:30,969
Yeah. Neither can l.

1415
01:49:32,679 --> 01:49:35,181
Um... before I go,
I'd like to give you something.

1416
01:49:35,432 --> 01:49:38,685
I know you can only use pocket watches.
I'd like you to have mine.

1417
01:49:38,935 --> 01:49:42,731
That is very kind, but in our Ordnung,
we don't accept gifts.

1418
01:49:45,734 --> 01:49:49,321
Samuel, this is the only thing I have
that's ever meant anything to me.

1419
01:49:49,571 --> 01:49:52,532
It was my grandfather's.

1420
01:49:52,782 --> 01:49:55,160
Well, I suppose we could barter.

1421
01:49:57,412 --> 01:50:00,373
Well, it is
a turn-of-the-century Swiss repeater.

1422
01:50:05,086 --> 01:50:07,297
What have you got?

1423
01:50:08,214 --> 01:50:12,802
How about a Swiss for a Belgian?

1424
01:50:16,598 --> 01:50:19,309
- Throw in some corn, it's a deal.
- Deal.

1425
01:50:24,022 --> 01:50:26,566
Don't open the back.

1426
01:50:32,781 --> 01:50:37,827
That was a great deal.
'97 Jag for a '54 Ford.

1427
01:50:38,078 --> 01:50:40,622
- He never saw it coming.
- Yeah, never.

1428
01:50:41,790 --> 01:50:45,794
- This has been quite a day, hasn't it?
- Yes, it has.

1429
01:50:46,044 --> 01:50:48,713
Came to say sorry to Sam,
did a good deed,

1430
01:50:48,964 --> 01:50:51,675
ended up with some feed and a steed.

1431
01:50:52,884 --> 01:50:57,138
And don't forget,
a basketful of schnitz pies.

1432
01:50:57,389 --> 01:51:00,350
- You're the schnitz pie.
- No, baby, you're the schnitz.

1433
01:51:28,003 --> 01:51:31,006
I think I just realised
why they call him Big John.

1434
01:51:31,256 --> 01:51:33,008
Would you let it go?

1435
01:51:38,096 --> 01:51:39,764
Here.

1436
01:51:43,059 --> 01:51:44,936
Brad!

1437
01:52:04,289 --> 01:52:07,292
I think we finally found something
you're good at.

1438
01:52:10,003 --> 01:52:11,379
Ow!

1439
01:52:24,100 --> 01:52:26,478
- Just a minute!
- Uh... excuse me.

1440
01:52:26,728 --> 01:52:30,440
I had debts. And needs.
Very expensive needs.

1441
01:52:30,690 --> 01:52:34,027
Fine wines. The Rolls. Special shoes.

1442
01:52:34,277 --> 01:52:38,239
I have high arches. It's very hard
to find a corrective shoe in a slip-on.

1443
01:52:52,462 --> 01:52:55,465
- Emma, I'll wait for you.
- Oh, good.

1444
01:53:13,149 --> 01:53:15,026
Brad, look out!

1445
01:53:15,277 --> 01:53:16,903
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1446
01:53:26,162 --> 01:53:28,206
Ahem.

1447
01:53:32,043 --> 01:53:34,421
Look at this. It's dja vu.

1448
01:53:35,547 --> 01:53:37,590
- That's the same cow, isn't it?
- Yeah.

1449
01:53:37,841 --> 01:53:40,802
- And the same pond.
- You know what?

1450
01:53:41,052 --> 01:53:43,096
I bet I could get it for a good price.

1451
01:53:43,346 --> 01:53:45,724
And it'd be a terrific place
to raise the baby.

1452
01:53:45,974 --> 01:53:47,642
Yep.

1453
01:53:47,892 --> 01:53:49,519
What?
