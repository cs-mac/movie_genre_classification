00:00:18,617 --> 00:00:20,585
Thank you.

3
00:00:20,619 --> 00:00:22,587
If you overate
too much tonight...

4
00:00:22,621 --> 00:00:26,079
I got a great song
the paesans would understand...

5
00:00:26,125 --> 00:00:27,592
"Agita."

6
00:00:27,626 --> 00:00:29,719
Una two!

7
00:00:29,762 --> 00:00:31,753
Agita

8
00:00:31,797 --> 00:00:34,732
My gumba in the banzone

9
00:00:34,767 --> 00:00:36,632
When I eat, he gets a treat

10
00:00:36,669 --> 00:00:38,637
Like a canzone

11
00:00:38,671 --> 00:00:40,434
He enjoys every meal

12
00:00:40,472 --> 00:00:42,167
Every bite that I steal

13
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:43,698
Agita

14
00:00:43,742 --> 00:00:46,438
My gumba in the banzone

15
00:00:46,478 --> 00:00:48,309
Za da da da da
boom cha boom cha

16
00:00:48,347 --> 00:00:50,144
Za da da dum
cha boom cha boom

17
00:00:50,182 --> 00:00:54,118
Some people like their pizza,
some people like-a suffrite

18
00:00:54,153 --> 00:00:57,816
And others like hot pepper
on everything they eat

19
00:00:57,856 --> 00:01:01,758
You'll hunger with a vuole
to taste that baccala

20
00:01:01,794 --> 00:01:05,127
Then all at once you think,
"Will I answer to gumba?"

21
00:01:05,164 --> 00:01:07,155
Ba ba ba ba bum
cha cha dum

22
00:01:07,199 --> 00:01:09,224
Ba ba ba ba bum
cha cha dum

23
00:01:09,268 --> 00:01:12,999
My lovely, lovely woman,
I hate to see her cry

24
00:01:13,038 --> 00:01:16,906
But when I start to mangia,
I get the evil eye

25
00:01:16,942 --> 00:01:18,705
My vuole's getting stronger

26
00:01:18,744 --> 00:01:20,905
Ah, the hell with my gumba

27
00:01:20,946 --> 00:01:25,406
Then I get it from my woman,
che da botts a na sciatta

28
00:01:25,451 --> 00:01:27,783
Agita

29
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:30,789
My gumba in the banzone

30
00:01:30,823 --> 00:01:32,791
When I eat, he gets a treat

31
00:01:32,825 --> 00:01:34,725
Like a canzone

32
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,591
He enjoys every meal

33
00:01:36,629 --> 00:01:38,529
Every bite that I steal

34
00:01:38,564 --> 00:01:40,054
Agita

35
00:01:40,099 --> 00:01:42,431
My gumba in the banzone

36
00:01:42,468 --> 00:01:45,631
Za da da dum

37
00:01:45,671 --> 00:01:47,434
You have to do Miami jokes.

38
00:01:47,473 --> 00:01:49,100
In Florida, you do Miami jokes.

39
00:01:49,141 --> 00:01:50,938
In Atlantic City you do...

40
00:01:50,976 --> 00:01:54,104
Morty, I tried Miami jokes.
I don't know what works anymore.

41
00:01:54,146 --> 00:01:55,306
Why? What happened?

42
00:01:55,347 --> 00:01:56,644
You know I got that big
Miami joke that I do...

43
00:01:56,682 --> 00:01:58,309
about the hotels
being expensive...

44
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:00,318
how much it costs to stay...

45
00:02:00,352 --> 00:02:02,286
like $150 a day
for a sleeping room.

46
00:02:02,321 --> 00:02:04,289
I asked the clerk
what's cheaper?

47
00:02:04,323 --> 00:02:05,950
He said,
"I got a room for $10...

48
00:02:05,991 --> 00:02:07,458
but you gotta
make your own bed."

49
00:02:07,493 --> 00:02:08,721
I said, "I'll take it..."

50
00:02:08,761 --> 00:02:10,729
so he gave me a hammer
and a board and some nails.

51
00:02:10,763 --> 00:02:12,230
That's a good joke. It works.

52
00:02:12,264 --> 00:02:14,596
It's been working for years.
Last night it died.

53
00:02:14,633 --> 00:02:17,568
Morty, that audience sat there
like they were an oil painting.

54
00:02:17,603 --> 00:02:20,401
I don't know why.
It always works when I do it.

55
00:02:20,439 --> 00:02:22,737
- You do that joke?
- Sure. All the time.

56
00:02:22,775 --> 00:02:24,072
Maybe that's where
I got it from.

57
00:02:24,109 --> 00:02:26,600
When I broke into
this business, in New York...

58
00:02:26,645 --> 00:02:29,614
I could play at least
twelve to twenty weeks a year...

59
00:02:29,648 --> 00:02:31,513
without leaving the city.

60
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:33,575
There was the Latin Quarter...

61
00:02:33,619 --> 00:02:35,746
China Doll, Elegante,
Queen's Terrace.

62
00:02:35,788 --> 00:02:37,619
Played the Boulevard.

63
00:02:37,656 --> 00:02:39,624
Well, what about Jersey?

64
00:02:39,658 --> 00:02:40,920
The Stagecoach.

65
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:42,085
Riviera, Bill Miller's.

66
00:02:42,127 --> 00:02:44,118
Look how far you have to go.

67
00:02:44,163 --> 00:02:46,597
You went to Washington
last week.

68
00:02:46,632 --> 00:02:49,567
I went to Baltimore.
You need good tires now.

69
00:02:49,601 --> 00:02:50,795
Or a good car.

70
00:02:50,836 --> 00:02:52,098
The first impression
I ever did...

71
00:02:52,137 --> 00:02:55,129
I saw a film called
"The Seventh Veil."

72
00:02:55,174 --> 00:02:57,665
I didn't even want
to become an impressionist.

73
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:01,009
I was trying to develop
an English accent.

74
00:03:01,046 --> 00:03:02,343
Impersonating
James Mason...

75
00:03:02,381 --> 00:03:04,611
was the furthest
thing from my mind.

76
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:06,641
I've been doing
impressions ever since.

77
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:11,088
This is like the mask.

78
00:03:11,123 --> 00:03:13,091
Then I did Picasso
for a few weeks.

79
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:16,094
You know the first time
I saw you do Mason?

80
00:03:16,128 --> 00:03:18,062
It was backstage
at the Sullivan show.

81
00:03:18,097 --> 00:03:21,589
You were brilliant.
I was there with Danny Rose.

82
00:03:21,633 --> 00:03:25,592
He was handling an actor
and a one-legged tap dancer.

83
00:03:25,637 --> 00:03:27,571
It was his normal handling.

84
00:03:27,606 --> 00:03:29,631
Always the best.

85
00:03:29,775 --> 00:03:31,072
May I say one word?

86
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:33,943
Might I just interject
one concept at this juncture?

87
00:03:33,979 --> 00:03:37,938
You're looking for somebody
for Memorial Day weekend.

88
00:03:37,983 --> 00:03:39,951
My blind xylophone player, OK?

89
00:03:39,985 --> 00:03:42,954
The man would be perfect
for your room.

90
00:03:42,988 --> 00:03:44,455
Aw, forget it.

91
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:46,458
Philly, please hear me out.

92
00:03:46,492 --> 00:03:50,189
The man is a beautiful man.
He's a fantastic individual.

93
00:03:50,229 --> 00:03:52,595
It's old Jewish people.
They're blind!

94
00:03:52,631 --> 00:03:54,861
They ain't gonna pay
to see a blind guy.

95
00:03:54,900 --> 00:04:00,099
All right. Forget that.
How about Herbie Jayson's birds?

96
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:02,437
They peck tunes out on a piano.

97
00:04:02,474 --> 00:04:05,102
- It's a beautiful thing!
- Never.

98
00:04:05,144 --> 00:04:07,112
What about
my one-legged tap dancer?

99
00:04:07,146 --> 00:04:09,205
- Take him for a weekend.
- No.

100
00:04:09,248 --> 00:04:10,909
All right,
my one-armed juggler?

101
00:04:10,949 --> 00:04:12,917
Not for my hotel.

102
00:04:12,951 --> 00:04:15,044
What about Lou Canova,
my Italian singer?

103
00:04:15,087 --> 00:04:16,418
He'd be great!

104
00:04:16,455 --> 00:04:19,151
Lou Canova's a dumb, fat
temperamental has-been...

105
00:04:19,191 --> 00:04:21,159
with a drinking problem.

106
00:04:21,193 --> 00:04:23,058
What about
Eddie Clark's penguin?

107
00:04:23,095 --> 00:04:25,393
That's the perfect...
Eddie Clark and his penguin.

108
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:27,399
The penguin skates
dressed as a rabbi.

109
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:31,028
It's hilarious. The penguin's
got a beard like a...

110
00:04:31,069 --> 00:04:33,094
Give me Sonny Chase.

111
00:04:33,138 --> 00:04:35,106
He's your best act.
He's fast, funny.

112
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:38,166
- I don't handle Sonny anymore.
- Since when?

113
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:40,440
It's a long story, Philly.

114
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:41,776
I discovered the kid.

115
00:04:41,814 --> 00:04:43,441
He slept on my sofa.
I supported him.

116
00:04:43,482 --> 00:04:45,950
I don't wanna
badmouth the kid...

117
00:04:45,984 --> 00:04:48,452
but he's a horrible,
dishonest, immoral louse.

118
00:04:48,487 --> 00:04:51,422
I say that with all due respect.

119
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:52,754
I know, Danny.

120
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:56,090
They get a little success,
and then they leave you.

121
00:04:56,128 --> 00:04:57,925
That's my point!
Believe me, Philly...

122
00:04:57,963 --> 00:05:00,454
if I had every act
that I started that made it...

123
00:05:00,499 --> 00:05:02,467
I'd be a rich man today.

124
00:05:02,501 --> 00:05:04,093
I'd like to help, Danny...

125
00:05:04,136 --> 00:05:06,104
but Weinstein's
Majestic Bungalow Colony...

126
00:05:06,138 --> 00:05:08,538
is a classy place,
and I need a classy act.

127
00:05:08,574 --> 00:05:10,906
Well, this lady
is the Jascha Heifetz...

128
00:05:10,943 --> 00:05:13,036
of this instrument.
She is really something.

129
00:05:13,078 --> 00:05:15,410
You gotta see this.
It's absolutely incredible.

130
00:05:19,451 --> 00:05:22,420
Never took a lesson.
She's self-taught.

131
00:05:22,454 --> 00:05:24,046
Next year, Philly,
my hand to God...

132
00:05:24,089 --> 00:05:25,920
she'll be at Carnegie Hall.

133
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:29,416
You can have her now
at the old price...

134
00:05:29,461 --> 00:05:32,089
which is anything
you want to give me...

135
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:33,427
anything at all, Philly.

136
00:05:33,465 --> 00:05:36,798
I remember that woman
that played the glasses.

137
00:05:36,835 --> 00:05:38,894
You have never seen acts
like this in your life.

138
00:05:38,937 --> 00:05:41,633
This guy worked his tail
off for these acts.

139
00:05:41,673 --> 00:05:44,801
If he believed in an act,
he went all-out.

140
00:05:44,843 --> 00:05:47,744
Danny, my partner wants me
to open up with a dachshund...

141
00:05:47,779 --> 00:05:51,806
but I think I should open up
with the swan or giraffe.

142
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:54,944
The swan is pretty.
It fascinates people.

143
00:05:54,987 --> 00:05:57,888
Or, have an animal of this type.

144
00:05:57,923 --> 00:06:00,448
I think your partner's right.

145
00:06:00,492 --> 00:06:02,460
You should open
with the dachshund...

146
00:06:02,494 --> 00:06:04,587
then move on and build
to the giraffe.

147
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:06,723
Close with the giraffe.
It's got more impact.

148
00:06:06,765 --> 00:06:08,460
Really?

149
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,694
If you take my advice...

150
00:06:09,735 --> 00:06:12,033
you'll become one of the great
balloon-folding acts...

151
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:14,038
of all time. Really,
'cause I don't see you just...

152
00:06:14,072 --> 00:06:16,700
folding balloons in joints.
You listen to me.

153
00:06:16,742 --> 00:06:20,405
You're gonna fold balloons
at universities and colleges.

154
00:06:20,445 --> 00:06:24,108
You're gonna make snails
and elephants on Broadway.

155
00:06:24,149 --> 00:06:27,277
But the thing to remember
is before you go out on stage...

156
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:30,914
Iook in the mirror
and say your three S's...

157
00:06:30,956 --> 00:06:33,618
star, smile, strong.

158
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:36,753
Star, smile, strong.

159
00:06:36,795 --> 00:06:38,922
Danny used to be a performer.

160
00:06:38,964 --> 00:06:40,932
He worked the Catskills.

161
00:06:40,966 --> 00:06:42,900
He did all the old jokes.

162
00:06:42,935 --> 00:06:44,596
And stole from everybody.

163
00:06:44,636 --> 00:06:46,604
He was exactly
the kind of comic...

164
00:06:46,638 --> 00:06:48,936
you'd think he'd be.

165
00:06:48,974 --> 00:06:51,966
- Sweetheart, how old are you?
- Eighty-one.

166
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:54,069
Eighty-one years old.
Isn't that fantastic?

167
00:06:54,112 --> 00:06:56,080
No, really, she's eighty-one.

168
00:06:56,114 --> 00:06:57,945
It's fantastic!

169
00:06:57,983 --> 00:06:59,450
Unbelievable.

170
00:06:59,484 --> 00:07:01,418
You don't look
a day over eighty.

171
00:07:01,453 --> 00:07:03,080
I'm just kidding,
darling, really.

172
00:07:03,121 --> 00:07:04,952
I love you, sweetheart.
You're really...

173
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:06,958
What sign are you, darling?

174
00:07:06,992 --> 00:07:08,391
What?

175
00:07:08,427 --> 00:07:09,894
What? She says what?
She's great.

176
00:07:09,928 --> 00:07:13,125
I drove up here today.
I love driving.

177
00:07:13,165 --> 00:07:15,030
You run across so many
interesting people.

178
00:07:15,067 --> 00:07:18,696
I saw a terrible accident.
Two taxicabs collided.

179
00:07:18,737 --> 00:07:20,830
Thirty Scotchmen were killed.

180
00:07:20,872 --> 00:07:23,272
The reason he stopped
doing his act is...

181
00:07:23,308 --> 00:07:26,766
because he was working
the Catskill Mountains.

182
00:07:26,812 --> 00:07:29,280
Nobody in the audience
is under eighty years old.

183
00:07:29,314 --> 00:07:32,875
He's on stage doing his act.
Two people get heart attacks.

184
00:07:32,918 --> 00:07:34,886
Naturally, he became
a personal manager.

185
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,046
Yeah, that's right.

186
00:07:36,088 --> 00:07:37,555
If you can't do a good act...

187
00:07:37,589 --> 00:07:39,318
you become
a personal manager, right?

188
00:07:39,358 --> 00:07:41,883
But his acts were devoted
to him. They loved him.

189
00:07:41,927 --> 00:07:43,792
Where are you gonna find
that kind of devotion?

190
00:07:43,829 --> 00:07:46,297
The funniest Danny Rose story...

191
00:07:46,331 --> 00:07:49,300
is the time when he's
handling a hypnotist.

192
00:07:49,334 --> 00:07:52,064
He's got the guy working
the Catskill Mountains.

193
00:07:52,104 --> 00:07:55,073
The hypnotist brings up
this little old Jewish lady...

194
00:07:55,107 --> 00:07:56,836
and he hypnotized her.

195
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:59,537
Tessie!
What's wrong with my wife?

196
00:07:59,578 --> 00:08:02,706
The body is warm.
It's a good sign.

197
00:08:04,216 --> 00:08:06,707
I promise, if your
wife never wakes up...

198
00:08:06,752 --> 00:08:10,347
I'll take you to
any restaurant of your choice.

199
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:12,755
I'll go to a restaurant
after my wife dies?

200
00:08:12,791 --> 00:08:15,089
Do you like Chinese food?

201
00:08:17,295 --> 00:08:19,763
It was such a sight!

202
00:08:19,798 --> 00:08:21,766
All right, are you finished?

203
00:08:23,301 --> 00:08:26,270
'Scuse me. Hold it.
Are you finished?

204
00:08:27,572 --> 00:08:30,769
Because I have
the greatest Danny Rose story.

205
00:08:30,809 --> 00:08:32,276
He's always got the greatest.

206
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:37,543
Hold it. I have the greatest
Danny Rose story, all right?

207
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:40,551
Do you want to do anything?

208
00:08:40,585 --> 00:08:42,553
'Cause this is gonna
take some time.

209
00:08:42,587 --> 00:08:44,452
I might have
to change my suit.

210
00:08:44,489 --> 00:08:45,717
Coffee!

211
00:08:45,757 --> 00:08:48,055
OK, are you ready?
We're gonna be here a while.

212
00:08:48,093 --> 00:08:50,561
This is the greatest
Danny Rose story.

213
00:08:50,595 --> 00:08:52,654
This is the one with Lou Canova.

214
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:54,723
That's the tall guy, the singer?

215
00:08:54,766 --> 00:08:57,564
The kid that had
those semi-hit records.

216
00:08:57,602 --> 00:09:00,036
He had a record
called "Agita."

217
00:09:00,072 --> 00:09:02,563
He was on the charts
for about fifteen minutes.

218
00:09:02,607 --> 00:09:04,575
This is not during
those fifteen minutes.

219
00:09:04,609 --> 00:09:07,908
This is
twenty-five years later...

220
00:09:07,946 --> 00:09:10,107
and Lou cannot get anybody
to handle him.

221
00:09:10,148 --> 00:09:12,173
I mean, the man's in trouble.

222
00:09:12,217 --> 00:09:14,845
The only one who believes
in him is Danny Rose.

223
00:09:14,886 --> 00:09:18,344
By now, remember,
Lou is a has-been.

224
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:21,018
He's got a big ego,
a temperament...

225
00:09:21,059 --> 00:09:25,086
and a slight drinking problem,
and Danny has faith.

226
00:09:29,034 --> 00:09:33,437
I like the looks of you

227
00:09:33,472 --> 00:09:38,466
The lure of you

228
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:43,243
The sweet of you

229
00:09:43,281 --> 00:09:47,581
The pure of you

230
00:09:47,619 --> 00:09:50,747
The eyes, the nose

231
00:09:50,789 --> 00:09:54,247
The mouth of you

232
00:09:54,292 --> 00:09:59,696
The East, West, North,
and the South of you

233
00:09:59,731 --> 00:10:02,256
I'd like to gain

234
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:07,738
Complete control of you

235
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:14,144
And handle even
the heart and soul of you

236
00:10:14,179 --> 00:10:18,582
So love at least
a small percent of me, do

237
00:10:18,617 --> 00:10:20,778
Do, do, I do, I do

238
00:10:20,819 --> 00:10:24,949
'Cause I love all of you

239
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:27,618
I do, I do, I do, I do

240
00:10:27,659 --> 00:10:29,854
Yeah

241
00:10:33,465 --> 00:10:36,798
Three shows?
I thought there was two.

242
00:10:36,835 --> 00:10:39,804
Three on weekdays,
four on weekends.

243
00:10:39,838 --> 00:10:41,100
Four? Tell 'em I'll walk.

244
00:10:41,139 --> 00:10:42,834
What do you mean?
You can't walk.

245
00:10:42,874 --> 00:10:45,104
Lou, we're not
in a position yet to walk.

246
00:10:45,143 --> 00:10:47,111
And I say yet.
I used the word yet.

247
00:10:47,145 --> 00:10:48,612
My hair's all screwed up.

248
00:10:48,647 --> 00:10:50,444
Your hair is fine.
Your tux is fine.

249
00:10:50,482 --> 00:10:52,279
Did you do the three S's?

250
00:10:52,317 --> 00:10:54,308
Strong, smile, star.
I know it.

251
00:10:54,352 --> 00:10:56,320
You tell me every time.

252
00:10:56,354 --> 00:10:58,322
Do "My Funny Valentine"...

253
00:10:58,356 --> 00:11:01,814
after you do great crooners
from the past who are deceased.

254
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:05,125
- Hi, Lou. I wanted to meet you.
- I'm discouraged. I'm down.

255
00:11:05,163 --> 00:11:07,961
Darling, later. Really.
God bless you, darling.

256
00:11:07,999 --> 00:11:09,728
What are discouraged about?
You're magnificent.

257
00:11:09,768 --> 00:11:11,759
I can't pay my alimony.

258
00:11:11,803 --> 00:11:15,762
I'll waive my commissions
till we get rolling.

259
00:11:15,807 --> 00:11:17,775
How will you live?
You gotta eat.

260
00:11:17,809 --> 00:11:19,777
Don't worry about me so much.
I got other acts.

261
00:11:19,811 --> 00:11:23,770
I think about you
in the long run.

262
00:11:23,815 --> 00:11:25,908
You're the kinda guy
that'll always make...

263
00:11:25,951 --> 00:11:27,816
a beautiful dollar
in this business.

264
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:30,048
You're what I call a perennial.

265
00:11:30,088 --> 00:11:32,283
You get better-Iooking
as you get older.

266
00:11:32,324 --> 00:11:34,087
That's true.
When I'm out there singing...

267
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:36,753
I can feel the women
mentally undressing me.

268
00:11:36,795 --> 00:11:38,490
It's true.

269
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:40,998
So Danny is everything to Lou.

270
00:11:41,032 --> 00:11:43,899
He picks his songs,
his arrangements.

271
00:11:43,935 --> 00:11:46,426
He picks his shirts,
his clothes.

272
00:11:46,471 --> 00:11:48,769
He eats with him.
They're inseparable.

273
00:11:48,807 --> 00:11:52,106
Danny's his manager, his friend,
his father confessor.

274
00:11:52,143 --> 00:11:53,633
Do me a favor.
I wanna go across the street...

275
00:11:53,678 --> 00:11:55,441
and get one white rose.

276
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,607
Why do you want a white rose?

277
00:11:57,649 --> 00:11:58,946
I met this chick.

278
00:11:58,984 --> 00:12:00,611
Don't tell me about it...

279
00:12:00,652 --> 00:12:04,952
because you're gonna
get caught in a hotel room.

280
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:07,458
You'll be paying
three alimonies, not two.

281
00:12:07,492 --> 00:12:11,394
This is a classy chick.
She's one of these decorators.

282
00:12:11,429 --> 00:12:14,990
With all due respect, Lou,
you got a sweet wife.

283
00:12:15,033 --> 00:12:16,557
This is different.
I'm in love.

284
00:12:16,601 --> 00:12:18,000
Great.

285
00:12:18,036 --> 00:12:21,972
The usual single white rose
for Tina Vitale.

286
00:12:22,007 --> 00:12:24,976
Just the words
"I love you, my bambina."

287
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:26,409
Come here.

288
00:12:26,444 --> 00:12:29,072
Step into my office
for a minute.

289
00:12:29,114 --> 00:12:33,073
What do you mean the usual rose?
How long has this been going on?

290
00:12:33,118 --> 00:12:35,484
For a while.
I can keep a secret.

291
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,987
You're keeping a secret from me?

292
00:12:37,022 --> 00:12:39,252
Look, I knew
you'd get miffed about it...

293
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:41,350
because of my wife
and everything...

294
00:12:41,393 --> 00:12:43,418
but Tina's... she's beautiful.

295
00:12:43,461 --> 00:12:45,088
She's like a madonna.

296
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:46,495
Does she know you're married?

297
00:12:46,531 --> 00:12:48,499
I leveled with her.

298
00:12:48,533 --> 00:12:52,094
So what kind of woman is she
if she knows you're married?

299
00:12:52,137 --> 00:12:54,298
I tried to introduce you
to her for a long time...

300
00:12:54,339 --> 00:12:56,432
but I knew you wouldn't have it.

301
00:12:56,474 --> 00:12:58,442
Have I tried
to teach you, Lou...

302
00:12:58,476 --> 00:13:00,944
that sooner or later
you'll have to...

303
00:13:00,979 --> 00:13:03,174
square yourself
with the big guy.

304
00:13:03,214 --> 00:13:05,512
Is that true?
You'll pay your dues.

305
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:07,450
You know?
You're a married man.

306
00:13:07,485 --> 00:13:09,715
My Aunt Rose.
Take my Aunt Rose.

307
00:13:09,754 --> 00:13:11,312
Not a beautiful woman at all.

308
00:13:11,356 --> 00:13:14,723
She looked like something from
a live-bait store, but wise.

309
00:13:14,759 --> 00:13:16,590
She had wisdom.
She used to say...

310
00:13:16,628 --> 00:13:20,064
"You can't ride two horses
with one behind."

311
00:13:20,098 --> 00:13:22,191
You see what I'm saying?
That's my point.

312
00:13:22,233 --> 00:13:25,066
Now a little time passes.

313
00:13:25,103 --> 00:13:27,571
Danny's still struggling
with the bird acts...

314
00:13:27,605 --> 00:13:30,073
and the blind xylophone player.

315
00:13:30,108 --> 00:13:33,566
Suddenly, the nostalgia craze
is starting to build.

316
00:13:33,611 --> 00:13:38,571
Danny finds he can
book Lou a little easier.

317
00:13:38,616 --> 00:13:41,414
You may be king

318
00:13:41,453 --> 00:13:46,584
You may possess
the world and all of its gold

319
00:13:46,624 --> 00:13:49,092
Oh, but gold won't bring you

320
00:13:49,127 --> 00:13:51,095
Happiness

321
00:13:51,129 --> 00:13:54,098
When you're growing old

322
00:13:54,132 --> 00:13:55,861
Oh, the world

323
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,197
It's still the same...

324
00:13:57,235 --> 00:13:58,930
He's working
these nostalgia cruises...

325
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:00,767
and the audience
is eating it up.

326
00:14:00,805 --> 00:14:03,706
Suddenly, an over-the-hill
boy singer...

327
00:14:03,742 --> 00:14:05,710
is starting to get
some attention.

328
00:14:05,744 --> 00:14:09,578
And the stars
they shine high above

329
00:14:09,614 --> 00:14:11,639
And I am honored to announce...

330
00:14:11,683 --> 00:14:16,120
that one of America's
great singing legends...

331
00:14:16,154 --> 00:14:18,054
a cherished musical legend...

332
00:14:18,089 --> 00:14:21,650
is making part of his comeback
on the Joe Franklin TV show.

333
00:14:21,693 --> 00:14:24,662
I hope my enthusiasm
is generating...

334
00:14:24,696 --> 00:14:27,164
because I love this man.

335
00:14:27,198 --> 00:14:30,292
I love Lou Canova.

336
00:14:30,335 --> 00:14:33,168
Thank you, Joe.
You're very kind.

337
00:14:33,204 --> 00:14:39,165
I've been on the show three,
four times, and it just helps.

338
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:42,304
You're New York.
What can I tell you?

339
00:14:42,347 --> 00:14:46,613
I always had the feeling
you were never obsessed...

340
00:14:46,651 --> 00:14:48,084
to be a superstar.

341
00:14:48,119 --> 00:14:51,020
You were never driven
to be a superstar.

342
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:52,921
You let it take its own course.

343
00:14:52,957 --> 00:14:55,118
When I had a record out
in the fifties...

344
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,128
it made some noise
and everything.

345
00:14:57,162 --> 00:15:00,131
You feel like you want
to be a bigger star.

346
00:15:00,165 --> 00:15:01,792
You wanna be this,
you wanna be that.

347
00:15:01,833 --> 00:15:03,596
It didn't bother me.

348
00:15:03,635 --> 00:15:05,933
Now I'm doing cruise ships,
bigger shows.

349
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:11,033
I feel great. It's a good time
in life to do it.

350
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:13,374
Now, two days later...

351
00:15:13,411 --> 00:15:16,642
Danny runs into Milton Berle
on Broadway.

352
00:15:16,681 --> 00:15:21,550
Milton is doing an NBC special,
a nostalgia show...

353
00:15:21,586 --> 00:15:23,554
plus he needs a singing act...

354
00:15:23,588 --> 00:15:26,056
to open for him
at Caesar's Palace.

355
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:28,059
Danny convinces him
to come and see Lou...

356
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:32,154
on a club date at the Waldorf,
and if Milton likes Lou...

357
00:15:32,197 --> 00:15:35,496
he gets the TV shot
and Caesar's.

358
00:15:35,533 --> 00:15:38,661
I love Milton.
He's a beautiful man.

359
00:15:38,703 --> 00:15:42,070
This is two years
out of our guts.

360
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:44,075
Don't be so nervous, Lou.

361
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:46,134
Take him out Sunday
and let him relax.

362
00:15:46,177 --> 00:15:47,838
He's gonna be all wound up.

363
00:15:47,879 --> 00:15:50,370
I'll open with "Volare"
or "You Make Me Feel So Young."

364
00:15:50,415 --> 00:15:53,179
How are you, darling?
How old are you?

365
00:15:53,218 --> 00:15:56,984
- Twelve.
- Are you married?

366
00:15:57,021 --> 00:15:58,579
It's fantastic fettucini.

367
00:15:58,623 --> 00:16:00,591
Don't forget to do
"My Funny Valentine"...

368
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:03,355
with the special lyrics
about the moon landing.

369
00:16:03,394 --> 00:16:05,259
We need a press agent.

370
00:16:05,296 --> 00:16:09,130
I'm getting your name
in the columns pretty good.

371
00:16:09,167 --> 00:16:12,625
It's not like
a steady press agent.

372
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:14,695
Take him to a movie,
or he'll be a wreck.

373
00:16:14,739 --> 00:16:17,264
Great idea for a TV show...

374
00:16:17,308 --> 00:16:20,766
"Mr. Television Looks at
the Stars of the Fifties."

375
00:16:20,812 --> 00:16:22,507
Beautiful!

376
00:16:22,547 --> 00:16:27,041
That week, Danny devotes
to Lou exclusively.

377
00:16:27,085 --> 00:16:30,213
They go over the running order
of his act fifteen times...

378
00:16:30,255 --> 00:16:32,485
what color shirts to wear,
his weight...

379
00:16:32,524 --> 00:16:34,458
he wants Lou
to lose some pounds.

380
00:16:34,492 --> 00:16:37,552
I don't know who's
more nervous... Lou or Danny.

381
00:16:37,595 --> 00:16:40,325
Meanwhile, his other clients
are starting to complain...

382
00:16:40,365 --> 00:16:42,299
about their own problems.

383
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:45,666
I had a crisis!
A cat ate my bird.

384
00:16:45,703 --> 00:16:49,070
I canceled the show.
Now Ralph won't pay.

385
00:16:49,107 --> 00:16:51,075
What do you mean,
you don't wanna pay?

386
00:16:51,109 --> 00:16:52,576
A cat ate his bird.

387
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:54,669
That comes under
the act of God clause.

388
00:16:54,712 --> 00:16:56,646
He gets paid
if he does the show.

389
00:16:56,681 --> 00:16:59,081
It was a lead bird.
It was Pee Wee.

390
00:16:59,117 --> 00:17:00,744
He pecked "September Song."

391
00:17:00,785 --> 00:17:02,184
Pee Wee's gone... Pee...

392
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:03,847
Ralph, what are you doing?

393
00:17:03,888 --> 00:17:06,083
Pee Wee has now been
eaten by a feline.

394
00:17:06,124 --> 00:17:09,116
Pee Wee gave us
many a laugh and tear.

395
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:12,357
Danny, I don't pay no birds
that don't work.

396
00:17:12,397 --> 00:17:15,525
Where were you
when I needed a replacement?

397
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:17,865
I admit, it's my fault.
I've been remiss lately.

398
00:17:17,902 --> 00:17:19,699
I've been very busy
with another client.

399
00:17:19,737 --> 00:17:22,535
After Sunday, my hand to God,
I'll be yours exclusively.

400
00:17:22,574 --> 00:17:24,371
I know how you feel.

401
00:17:24,409 --> 00:17:28,641
Pee Wee was the son
he never had, so it's...

402
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:31,444
I promise, after Sunday night,
I'm with you.

403
00:17:31,482 --> 00:17:33,541
Un, deux, one, two...

404
00:17:33,585 --> 00:17:35,712
Tomorrow night
I want you to open with...

405
00:17:35,753 --> 00:17:38,017
"You're Nobody Till
Somebody Loves You."

406
00:17:38,056 --> 00:17:39,887
Then go into "My Bambina."

407
00:17:39,924 --> 00:17:42,552
After that, do great crooners
from the past...

408
00:17:42,594 --> 00:17:44,653
who are now deceased.

409
00:17:44,696 --> 00:17:46,061
And then "Agita."

410
00:17:46,097 --> 00:17:48,657
Danny, would you do me a favor
tomorrow night?

411
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,167
You name it, you got it.

412
00:17:50,201 --> 00:17:53,170
- I want you to bring Tina.
- Who's Tina?

413
00:17:53,204 --> 00:17:55,570
Come on.
I'm really crazy about her.

414
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:57,575
I thought I talked you
out of that.

415
00:17:57,609 --> 00:18:00,237
It's no use.
I'm like a little kid.

416
00:18:00,278 --> 00:18:02,178
I'm still sending her
a white rose every day.

417
00:18:02,213 --> 00:18:04,078
Don't we have enough
on our mind?

418
00:18:04,115 --> 00:18:07,175
She's been lucky for me
from the first day I met her.

419
00:18:07,218 --> 00:18:10,119
Yeah, but Teresa's
gonna be there.

420
00:18:10,154 --> 00:18:12,145
You're gonna get
in a lotta trouble.

421
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:15,626
That's why you gotta bring her.
You be the beard.

422
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,685
I don't want to be a beard.

423
00:18:17,729 --> 00:18:20,027
Come on, I'll do a great job
if she's there.

424
00:18:20,064 --> 00:18:21,622
Without her, I'm gonna be lost.

425
00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:23,634
Since when?
Lou, this is business.

426
00:18:23,668 --> 00:18:25,966
Why are you making
such a big deal out of this?

427
00:18:26,004 --> 00:18:27,471
Terry goes home
right after the show.

428
00:18:27,505 --> 00:18:29,530
Then I'll take her
off your hands.

429
00:18:29,574 --> 00:18:31,633
When there's any people around,
she's with you.

430
00:18:31,676 --> 00:18:34,110
You could wind up
in alimony jail.

431
00:18:34,145 --> 00:18:36,204
I can't function without her.

432
00:18:36,247 --> 00:18:38,147
Since when?
Who is this woman?

433
00:18:38,182 --> 00:18:40,116
Why does she have
such a hold on you?

434
00:18:40,151 --> 00:18:42,483
I don't know what it is
about her. I love her.

435
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,545
Maybe it's a mother thing.

436
00:18:44,589 --> 00:18:47,057
Your mother's alive.
Let me take her.

437
00:18:47,091 --> 00:18:49,218
She gives me confidence.
I love her.

438
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:52,423
I'm scared enough as it is.

439
00:18:52,463 --> 00:18:55,296
Jesus, Lou, is this more
serious than I thought?

440
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:57,267
You don't listen to me
when I talk.

441
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:59,270
I haven't had a night's sleep...

442
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:01,397
trying to figure out
what to do with my life, OK?

443
00:19:01,439 --> 00:19:04,602
So all of a sudden,
I got to be the beard?

444
00:19:04,642 --> 00:19:09,511
I got to know she's there,
and I gotta know she loves me.

445
00:19:09,547 --> 00:19:12,846
I can only say,
as your friend and manager...

446
00:19:12,884 --> 00:19:14,511
you're a sick individual...

447
00:19:14,552 --> 00:19:17,544
but if that's what you want,
we'll do it.

448
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:57,887
Tina? You're Tina?
Danny Rose.

449
00:19:57,929 --> 00:19:59,658
Had no trouble
getting here at all.

450
00:19:59,697 --> 00:20:01,562
Are you ready?
'Cause I'm double-parked.

451
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:03,396
Listen, Lou, you can drop dead.

452
00:20:03,434 --> 00:20:05,334
That's what you been
saying for months.

453
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:07,065
I don't buy it.

454
00:20:07,105 --> 00:20:09,573
I'm sick and tired
of your stories.

455
00:20:09,607 --> 00:20:14,601
Being married is one thing,
but two-timing's something else.

456
00:20:14,645 --> 00:20:16,909
That's a bunch of garbage.

457
00:20:16,948 --> 00:20:18,575
Because I don't buy it.

458
00:20:18,616 --> 00:20:20,345
And you better watch yourself!

459
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:22,580
I don't care
how important it is.

460
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:24,588
It's too damn bad
if you're upset.

461
00:20:24,622 --> 00:20:26,590
The way you treat me,
you're lucky I don't...

462
00:20:26,624 --> 00:20:29,593
stick an ice pick
in your goddamn chest!

463
00:20:29,627 --> 00:20:31,094
Like hell I'll be there!

464
00:20:31,129 --> 00:20:34,690
You know what you can do!
Goddamn phony!

465
00:20:34,732 --> 00:20:38,259
Lou tells me you're
an interior decorator.

466
00:20:38,302 --> 00:20:40,099
I don't want to hear Lou's name.

467
00:20:40,138 --> 00:20:41,935
I don't want any crap,
God damn it!

468
00:20:41,973 --> 00:20:43,702
Darling, sweetheart...

469
00:20:43,741 --> 00:20:47,700
may I interject one notion
at this juncture?

470
00:20:47,745 --> 00:20:49,713
Sweetheart, how old are you?

471
00:20:49,747 --> 00:20:51,715
None of your goddamn business.

472
00:20:51,749 --> 00:20:55,207
Darling, you're upset.
What sign are you? Gemini?

473
00:20:55,253 --> 00:20:56,720
Will you shut up?

474
00:20:56,754 --> 00:21:00,713
Can I just say
one thing, sweetheart?

475
00:21:00,758 --> 00:21:03,727
My father, may he rest in peace,
would say...

476
00:21:03,761 --> 00:21:06,787
"Maturity, a little tolerance,
a willingness to give."

477
00:21:06,831 --> 00:21:09,664
It's a big night for Lou.
Don't ruin it for him.

478
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:11,167
I don't wanna talk
to that creep!

479
00:21:11,202 --> 00:21:12,669
What happened?
I don't understand.

480
00:21:12,703 --> 00:21:14,068
Go to hell!

481
00:21:14,105 --> 00:21:16,073
Sweetheart,
may I make one statement...

482
00:21:16,107 --> 00:21:18,166
and I don't mean to be
didactic nor facetious...

483
00:21:18,209 --> 00:21:19,904
What are you talking about?

484
00:21:19,944 --> 00:21:22,174
The man's crazy about you.
He's nuts for you.

485
00:21:22,213 --> 00:21:27,173
My friends saw him last night
with a cheap blonde.

486
00:21:27,218 --> 00:21:30,676
Would Lou fall for
a cheap blonde?

487
00:21:30,721 --> 00:21:32,689
The man has class.

488
00:21:32,723 --> 00:21:34,691
I thought so, too.

489
00:21:34,725 --> 00:21:36,693
Sweetheart, I promise you...

490
00:21:36,727 --> 00:21:38,695
he's cheating with you.
He's got integrity.

491
00:21:38,729 --> 00:21:42,096
He cheats with one person
at a time. That's his style.

492
00:21:42,133 --> 00:21:44,693
My friends told me he was
at the track last night...

493
00:21:44,735 --> 00:21:46,600
with his arm around
a cheap blonde.

494
00:21:46,637 --> 00:21:48,605
They bother him
because he's cute.

495
00:21:48,639 --> 00:21:51,699
They try and grab,
so he pushes them away.

496
00:21:51,742 --> 00:21:54,210
Maybe when he pushes,
his arm goes around...

497
00:21:54,245 --> 00:21:56,213
Aw, knock it off.
You think I buy that?

498
00:21:57,748 --> 00:21:59,613
His wife is blonde.
She's not cheap.

499
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:03,211
A lovely woman, educated.
She's a cocktail waitress.

500
00:22:03,254 --> 00:22:05,222
They don't all hustle.

501
00:22:05,256 --> 00:22:06,780
What the hell do you want?

502
00:22:06,824 --> 00:22:08,382
Please, don't upset him.

503
00:22:08,426 --> 00:22:10,053
I'm not coming.

504
00:22:10,094 --> 00:22:11,391
You got that? Drop dead!

505
00:22:11,429 --> 00:22:13,397
Let me speak to him.

506
00:22:13,431 --> 00:22:17,561
Hello, Lou. Yes, it's me.
I got here OK.

507
00:22:17,602 --> 00:22:21,766
The directions were good.
It was a Gulf station.

508
00:22:23,441 --> 00:22:25,568
She seems to be a little upset.

509
00:22:31,616 --> 00:22:34,244
- Will you get lost!
- Where are you going?

510
00:22:34,285 --> 00:22:37,413
I've got other things
on my mind besides two-timers.

511
00:22:37,455 --> 00:22:39,423
The man is crazy about you.

512
00:22:39,457 --> 00:22:41,687
He wants you ringside.

513
00:22:41,726 --> 00:22:43,694
Why'd you come
to get me so early for?

514
00:22:43,728 --> 00:22:46,595
- I come every place early.
- You're hours early.

515
00:22:46,631 --> 00:22:49,600
'Cause tonight's a big night.
Milton is coming tonight.

516
00:22:49,634 --> 00:22:51,659
Remember when you
were a little girl...

517
00:22:51,702 --> 00:22:53,636
Milton, Tuesday nights?

518
00:22:53,671 --> 00:22:55,605
He'd wear a dress.
He's an immortal!

519
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:58,700
Why does he two-time me?

520
00:22:58,743 --> 00:23:01,109
You got it wrong.
Women annoy him.

521
00:23:01,145 --> 00:23:04,012
He sings, and they
mentally undress him.

522
00:23:06,484 --> 00:23:09,282
I see an adventure.

523
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,288
Yes. A trip.

524
00:23:11,322 --> 00:23:16,760
A man in a gray suit who owns
a dog will come to see you.

525
00:23:16,794 --> 00:23:18,659
That's Tommy.

526
00:23:18,696 --> 00:23:20,163
Tommy?

527
00:23:20,197 --> 00:23:22,165
When is he coming?

528
00:23:22,199 --> 00:23:23,666
Soon.

529
00:23:23,701 --> 00:23:26,169
When you least expect it.

530
00:23:26,203 --> 00:23:28,637
What are you doing here?

531
00:23:28,673 --> 00:23:32,473
At least call Lou.

532
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:34,171
Will you just get outta here?

533
00:23:34,211 --> 00:23:36,179
The man is nervous.
He doesn't seem so...

534
00:23:36,213 --> 00:23:38,681
She wants to get ahead.

535
00:23:38,716 --> 00:23:40,684
I've been waiting.

536
00:23:40,718 --> 00:23:43,243
- My nephew's ill.
- He's ill?

537
00:23:43,287 --> 00:23:46,723
- He has a lump on his neck.
- A lump on his neck?

538
00:23:46,757 --> 00:23:48,088
Aw, that's terrible.
God bless you.

539
00:23:48,125 --> 00:23:51,253
- How old are you, darling?
- Seventy-eight.

540
00:23:51,295 --> 00:23:53,957
Seventy-eight? That's wonderful.
What are your hobbies?

541
00:23:53,998 --> 00:23:55,260
Fish.

542
00:23:55,299 --> 00:23:57,096
Fish? Tropical fish?
That's incredible.

543
00:23:57,134 --> 00:23:58,567
My Uncle Menachem,
may he rest in peace...

544
00:23:58,603 --> 00:24:01,595
a wonderful man,
raised hamsters.

545
00:24:01,639 --> 00:24:04,199
I personally
found them disgusting.

546
00:24:04,241 --> 00:24:06,209
But he adored them...

547
00:24:06,243 --> 00:24:08,404
like you probably feel
about your guppies.

548
00:24:08,446 --> 00:24:10,311
These are wonderful people.

549
00:24:10,348 --> 00:24:13,044
They're of your persuasion.
Lou's of your persuasion.

550
00:24:13,084 --> 00:24:14,381
Lou's a liar.

551
00:24:14,418 --> 00:24:16,545
He loves you like a mother.

552
00:24:16,587 --> 00:24:19,715
All that crap about his
bad marriage and then he lies?

553
00:24:19,757 --> 00:24:21,224
The man loves her like a mother.

554
00:24:21,258 --> 00:24:23,158
He worships the ground
she walks on.

555
00:24:23,194 --> 00:24:24,627
Angelina, my lover's unfaithful.

556
00:24:24,662 --> 00:24:27,563
Excuse me, Angelina.
Might I interject one concept?

557
00:24:27,598 --> 00:24:31,398
He is unfaithful,
yet he cares for you.

558
00:24:31,435 --> 00:24:34,165
See, he cares. God bless you.

559
00:24:34,205 --> 00:24:35,900
Don't go to him.

560
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:38,067
- I won't.
- Wait. Time out.

561
00:24:38,109 --> 00:24:41,237
See friends,
resolve all situations...

562
00:24:41,278 --> 00:24:45,772
even if it means
traveling long distances.

563
00:24:45,816 --> 00:24:47,306
But be careful.

564
00:24:47,351 --> 00:24:49,012
Where you going?

565
00:24:49,053 --> 00:24:53,581
Lou, we're into a definite
type of situation here.

566
00:24:53,624 --> 00:24:56,593
Definitely.

567
00:24:56,627 --> 00:24:59,095
We're into a complete
type of situation.

568
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:01,098
I'm telling you,
it's a complete...

569
00:25:01,132 --> 00:25:03,259
definite type of situation.

570
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:08,260
Why is she so mad at me?
What did I do?

571
00:25:08,305 --> 00:25:10,273
Won't she speak to me?

572
00:25:10,307 --> 00:25:12,298
I need a drink.

573
00:25:12,343 --> 00:25:15,369
Don't get the jitters,
because you get nervous...

574
00:25:15,413 --> 00:25:18,780
your whole performance
goes right into the toilet.

575
00:25:18,816 --> 00:25:20,784
You start drinking...
Lou, I'll get her there.

576
00:25:20,818 --> 00:25:22,786
I promise. Just let me
work out the logistics.

577
00:25:30,294 --> 00:25:31,727
Now it's the big day.

578
00:25:31,762 --> 00:25:34,287
Things are starting
to go wrong.

579
00:25:34,331 --> 00:25:36,299
Lou is boozing a little bit.

580
00:25:36,333 --> 00:25:38,301
He liked Cutty Sark.

581
00:25:38,335 --> 00:25:39,802
Now she splits.

582
00:25:39,837 --> 00:25:41,168
The girl?

583
00:25:41,205 --> 00:25:43,298
And Danny follows.

584
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:45,808
She drives and she drives
way the hell out somewhere.

585
00:25:45,843 --> 00:25:49,472
Danny's on her heels,
but you know how he drives.

586
00:25:49,513 --> 00:25:53,813
She winds up, an hour later,
God knows where.

587
00:25:53,851 --> 00:25:56,820
She's taken Angelina
the fortune teller's advice.

588
00:25:56,854 --> 00:25:59,152
She's winding up business
with old friends.

589
00:26:00,624 --> 00:26:03,320
We didn't think you were coming.

590
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:07,091
I had a change in plans.

591
00:26:07,131 --> 00:26:09,497
The party can begin.

592
00:26:35,593 --> 00:26:36,890
Can we help you, sir?

593
00:26:36,927 --> 00:26:38,053
I'm with Tina.

594
00:26:38,095 --> 00:26:40,063
I'm a friend of Tina's.

595
00:26:40,097 --> 00:26:42,065
God bless you, fellas.
Stay where you are.

596
00:26:42,099 --> 00:26:44,567
You're doing an aces job.

597
00:26:44,602 --> 00:26:47,833
I'll leave
something nice for you.

598
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:54,143
Who are you?

599
00:26:54,178 --> 00:26:55,645
I'm here with Tina.

600
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:57,647
I'm her Uncle Rocco.

601
00:26:57,681 --> 00:26:59,649
Danny Rose,
theatrical management.

602
00:26:59,683 --> 00:27:01,651
What are you looking for?

603
00:27:01,685 --> 00:27:03,653
I'm looking for Tina.
I lost her.

604
00:27:03,687 --> 00:27:05,587
Relax. You gotta be
around her every second?

605
00:27:05,623 --> 00:27:07,147
What do you do, Rocco?

606
00:27:07,191 --> 00:27:09,182
Cement. I own a fleet
of cement mixers.

607
00:27:09,226 --> 00:27:10,352
No kidding!

608
00:27:10,394 --> 00:27:13,591
Isn't that a very big
organized cri...

609
00:27:13,631 --> 00:27:18,034
Cement, that's fantastic.
You always need cement.

610
00:27:18,068 --> 00:27:19,865
That's what's great
about cement.

611
00:27:19,904 --> 00:27:21,872
It's not like tape recorders.

612
00:27:21,906 --> 00:27:23,601
This is Tina's new boyfriend.

613
00:27:23,641 --> 00:27:26,610
How long you been going out
with my niece?

614
00:27:26,644 --> 00:27:30,102
We don't go out.
We're just friends.

615
00:27:30,147 --> 00:27:32,115
Yeah, right. I know Tina.

616
00:27:32,149 --> 00:27:34,117
Vinnie!
Danny's in show business.

617
00:27:34,151 --> 00:27:36,119
He's a manager.

618
00:27:36,153 --> 00:27:37,882
Yeah? You know Jackie Whalen?

619
00:27:37,922 --> 00:27:39,719
He's a comedian.
He's funny.

620
00:27:39,757 --> 00:27:42,123
I don't think he's funny.
I think he's dirty.

621
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:44,719
Well, today, everything's
pornography, am I right?

622
00:27:44,762 --> 00:27:46,889
All the four-letter words.
It's all filthy.

623
00:27:46,931 --> 00:27:51,630
I saw this guy in Atlantic City.
He cuts a hole in a cigar box.

624
00:27:51,669 --> 00:27:54,900
Then he goes backstage,
he opens up his fly...

625
00:27:54,939 --> 00:27:56,270
and sticks his thing in it.

626
00:27:56,307 --> 00:27:58,241
Then he goes outside
down to ringside...

627
00:27:58,275 --> 00:28:01,073
to some old lady's table,
opens up the box.

628
00:28:01,111 --> 00:28:02,635
I mean, that's humor?

629
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:05,148
They call me old-fashioned,
but if it's old-fashioned...

630
00:28:05,182 --> 00:28:06,809
to like Mr. Danny Kaye...

631
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:08,842
Mr. Bob Hope,
Mr. Milton Berle...

632
00:28:08,886 --> 00:28:11,047
then all right,
then I'm old-fashioned.

633
00:28:12,256 --> 00:28:14,019
Tina, can't we discuss it?

634
00:28:14,058 --> 00:28:16,026
We discussed it a hundred times.

635
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:18,051
Then why did you
come here today?

636
00:28:18,095 --> 00:28:20,529
I don't know.
I guess I shouldn't have.

637
00:28:20,564 --> 00:28:23,692
- I love you.
- It's over.

638
00:28:23,734 --> 00:28:26,032
If I thought that,
I'd kill myself.

639
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:27,697
Johnny, don't talk like that.

640
00:28:27,738 --> 00:28:29,365
You know I'd do it, too.

641
00:28:29,406 --> 00:28:30,703
You're too emotional.

642
00:28:30,741 --> 00:28:32,538
I wrote you a poem.

643
00:28:32,576 --> 00:28:35,101
It's about our month in Sicily.

644
00:28:35,145 --> 00:28:37,113
Can't you forget it?

645
00:28:37,147 --> 00:28:41,607
"We strolled on cliffs of stone
like Greeks of ancient times.

646
00:28:41,652 --> 00:28:44,052
"Your hair blew
this way and that...

647
00:28:44,088 --> 00:28:46,989
"mixed with bits of sand.

648
00:28:47,024 --> 00:28:49,117
"Our eyes met,
and then looked out...

649
00:28:49,159 --> 00:28:52,526
"toward the sea,
the blue Aegean."

650
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:55,991
What are you doing here?

651
00:28:56,033 --> 00:28:58,001
You're thinking pushy.
Right?

652
00:28:58,035 --> 00:28:59,332
I'm reading a poem.

653
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:02,237
I'm sorry.
I came to get you.

654
00:29:02,273 --> 00:29:05,242
- What are you doing here?
- I want you to come with me.

655
00:29:05,276 --> 00:29:06,800
Who are you?

656
00:29:06,844 --> 00:29:08,072
Danny Rose,
theatrical management.

657
00:29:08,112 --> 00:29:11,775
Might I just get five minutes
with the young lady alone?

658
00:29:11,815 --> 00:29:14,511
I'm dying to come
to the Waldorf.

659
00:29:14,551 --> 00:29:16,815
It's just that I've been hurt.

660
00:29:16,854 --> 00:29:19,345
So this is who's been sending
the single white roses.

661
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:20,948
Danny Rose.

662
00:29:20,991 --> 00:29:23,289
How do you know
about the white roses?

663
00:29:23,327 --> 00:29:26,125
I know more about you
than you think I know.

664
00:29:26,163 --> 00:29:27,323
Might I interject something...

665
00:29:27,364 --> 00:29:29,491
You know because you spy on me.

666
00:29:29,533 --> 00:29:31,865
It's not spying when
you care about someone...

667
00:29:31,902 --> 00:29:33,631
how they live,
what's happening to them.

668
00:29:33,671 --> 00:29:35,536
You check my mailbox
in my apartment...

669
00:29:35,572 --> 00:29:38,040
when I'm not there.
Admit it!

670
00:29:38,075 --> 00:29:40,100
So you prefer him
with his white roses...

671
00:29:40,144 --> 00:29:42,044
to me and all we were
to each other?

672
00:29:42,079 --> 00:29:46,015
I prefer someone that
respects me and doesn't spy.

673
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:47,574
Are you going with him?

674
00:29:49,954 --> 00:29:52,650
Can I get one...

675
00:30:00,698 --> 00:30:02,598
What are you doing with money?

676
00:30:02,633 --> 00:30:04,999
You see what they're doing?

677
00:30:05,035 --> 00:30:08,493
I've been tearing money
since my first Holy Communion.

678
00:30:08,539 --> 00:30:10,131
See? Ten dollars.

679
00:30:10,174 --> 00:30:12,642
I don't care. Here.
What does it mean?

680
00:30:12,676 --> 00:30:13,836
Twenty.

681
00:30:13,877 --> 00:30:15,742
Here's twenty, forty.

682
00:30:15,779 --> 00:30:16,905
They're crazy.

683
00:30:16,947 --> 00:30:19,507
What does it mean?
It means nothing.

684
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:21,074
Why don't you stop it?

685
00:30:21,118 --> 00:30:23,052
Mere fascination, that's all.

686
00:30:23,087 --> 00:30:25,920
I want to see Lou,
but he treats me lousy.

687
00:30:25,956 --> 00:30:31,087
Lou's crazy about you.
Tonight's a big shot for him.

688
00:30:31,128 --> 00:30:33,596
Will all due respect for Lou,
he's not a kid.

689
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:35,097
He's trying to make a comeback.

690
00:30:35,132 --> 00:30:38,568
When he sings "That's Amore,"
that's the end for me.

691
00:30:38,602 --> 00:30:40,593
Is it unbelievable
what he does with that song?

692
00:30:40,637 --> 00:30:42,264
Isn't that fantastic?

693
00:30:42,306 --> 00:30:44,797
I'm going to hit you
with one word...

694
00:30:44,842 --> 00:30:46,901
just one word...
Sorrento.

695
00:30:46,944 --> 00:30:48,844
Sorrento? Am I lying?

696
00:30:48,879 --> 00:30:52,110
I like it when he takes
the microphone off the stand...

697
00:30:52,149 --> 00:30:54,117
and sort of throws
the microphone...

698
00:30:54,151 --> 00:30:55,618
from hand to hand.

699
00:30:55,652 --> 00:30:57,620
That's my gesture.
I gave him that.

700
00:30:57,654 --> 00:31:00,782
Years ago he took
the microphone off the stand.

701
00:31:00,824 --> 00:31:02,792
But he didn't throw it
from hand to hand.

702
00:31:02,826 --> 00:31:04,623
I used to do that
in nightclub acts.

703
00:31:04,661 --> 00:31:06,629
So you taught him
to throw the microphone...

704
00:31:06,663 --> 00:31:07,960
from hand to hand.

705
00:31:07,998 --> 00:31:09,556
I taught him
everything he knows.

706
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,568
I gave him his gestures.
I handle his budget.

707
00:31:11,602 --> 00:31:13,069
I pick his clothes, his songs.

708
00:31:13,103 --> 00:31:14,866
And you manage his love life.

709
00:31:14,905 --> 00:31:17,738
Look, my father,
may he rest in peace, said,

710
00:31:17,775 --> 00:31:20,573
"In business,
friendly but not familiar."

711
00:31:20,611 --> 00:31:22,636
This is personal management
I'm in.

712
00:31:22,679 --> 00:31:25,739
The key word is personal.
So I got to get involved.

713
00:31:25,783 --> 00:31:30,811
Like Herbie Jayson, my bird act.
A cat ate the lead bird.

714
00:31:30,854 --> 00:31:32,913
I got to leap
right into the breach.

715
00:31:32,956 --> 00:31:34,924
Or my Puerto Rican
ventriloquist.

716
00:31:34,958 --> 00:31:37,586
The kid's got everything
you need to make it big.

717
00:31:37,628 --> 00:31:41,086
He's a dope addict.
I got to get in there and help.

718
00:31:41,131 --> 00:31:42,496
What can I say?

719
00:31:42,533 --> 00:31:45,593
I'm the wrong guy
to be the beard...

720
00:31:45,636 --> 00:31:48,434
because who would believe
that such a beautiful girl...

721
00:31:48,472 --> 00:31:50,133
- would date me?
- Come on.

722
00:31:50,174 --> 00:31:52,608
I'm telling the truth,
my hand to God.

723
00:31:52,643 --> 00:31:54,201
No, sweetheart,
I'm telling you...

724
00:31:54,244 --> 00:31:56,439
and I see a lot
of singers and actresses.

725
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,539
You're not so terrible.

726
00:31:58,582 --> 00:32:00,049
I know one thing, honey.

727
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:02,109
I'm never going
to be Cary Grant.

728
00:32:02,152 --> 00:32:05,610
I don't care what anybody says.
Can I get a sip of that?

729
00:32:05,656 --> 00:32:07,624
Can I tell you a secret?

730
00:32:07,658 --> 00:32:11,560
I'm not just trying
to make you feel good.

731
00:32:11,595 --> 00:32:14,063
Handsome men
never did anything for me.

732
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:16,498
You know what turns me on?
Intellectual.

733
00:32:16,533 --> 00:32:20,230
I'm not just saying this to
make you feel good or anything.

734
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:21,669
You're a smooth talker.

735
00:32:21,705 --> 00:32:25,038
Angelina once even predicted
I would marry a Jew.

736
00:32:25,075 --> 00:32:26,770
Did she say which Jew?

737
00:32:26,810 --> 00:32:28,903
A Jew or someone musical.

738
00:32:28,946 --> 00:32:31,915
Listen, sweetheart, now that
we're talking about music...

739
00:32:31,949 --> 00:32:33,746
could you go call Lou?

740
00:32:33,784 --> 00:32:35,513
'Cause the guy needs you.

741
00:32:35,552 --> 00:32:38,578
Give him a call, 'cause
it's late. We'll get outta here.

742
00:32:38,622 --> 00:32:40,419
Please, darling.

743
00:32:41,458 --> 00:32:43,983
No, Lou.
It's not that I hate you.

744
00:32:44,027 --> 00:32:47,588
It's just you get me
angry sometimes.

745
00:32:47,631 --> 00:32:51,089
I'm going to...
I was always going to be there.

746
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:52,602
I'll be there.

747
00:32:52,636 --> 00:32:55,104
Will you listen to me?
I'm coming.

748
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:58,404
It's just that sometimes
you get me crazy.

749
00:33:01,111 --> 00:33:03,602
Oh, my God. Look!

750
00:33:04,748 --> 00:33:07,512
She betrayed me with him.

751
00:33:07,551 --> 00:33:09,348
Danny Rose.

752
00:33:09,386 --> 00:33:11,547
Oh, my God!

753
00:33:11,588 --> 00:33:13,852
He drank iodine.

754
00:33:13,891 --> 00:33:17,759
He seduced her away from me.

755
00:33:17,794 --> 00:33:21,230
Were you seeing Tina
while she was seeing Johnny?

756
00:33:21,265 --> 00:33:22,789
Would I do that?

757
00:33:22,833 --> 00:33:26,360
Then who sent the white roses,
one every day?

758
00:33:26,403 --> 00:33:30,362
Johnny, what happened?

759
00:33:30,407 --> 00:33:32,238
What happened? Tell Mommy.

760
00:33:32,276 --> 00:33:35,871
My son is sensitive.
He's a poet.

761
00:33:39,449 --> 00:33:42,714
He's fantastic.
How old are you, Johnny?

762
00:33:42,753 --> 00:33:45,654
- He's forty.
- Unbelievable.

763
00:33:45,689 --> 00:33:47,657
Are you an Aries?

764
00:33:47,691 --> 00:33:50,592
Johnny's been made
a fool out of.

765
00:33:50,627 --> 00:33:54,654
They force him
to wear the horns!

766
00:33:57,501 --> 00:34:03,167
We were engaged
until he put a spell on her.

767
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:05,539
This man's a beautiful man.

768
00:34:05,576 --> 00:34:07,669
He's a fantastic individual.

769
00:34:07,711 --> 00:34:10,145
Vendetta!

770
00:34:20,691 --> 00:34:24,627
Boy, that guy Johnny must
have been crazy about you.

771
00:34:24,661 --> 00:34:26,629
I don't know.
I like to flirt.

772
00:34:26,663 --> 00:34:29,632
Sometimes people
take it too seriously.

773
00:34:29,666 --> 00:34:31,634
Johnny's all right.
He was really nice to me...

774
00:34:31,668 --> 00:34:33,636
when my marriage fell apart.

775
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:35,570
And what did your husband do?

776
00:34:35,606 --> 00:34:38,131
A little bookmaking,
loan sharking...

777
00:34:38,175 --> 00:34:40,405
extortion... like that.

778
00:34:40,444 --> 00:34:42,275
A professional man.

779
00:34:42,312 --> 00:34:44,371
What'd you do, you divorced him
or got a separation or what?

780
00:34:44,414 --> 00:34:46,712
Some guy shot him in the eyes.

781
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:49,412
- Really? He's blind?
- Dead.

782
00:34:49,453 --> 00:34:51,921
Dead. Of course,
'cause the bullets go through.

783
00:34:51,955 --> 00:34:53,445
Oh, my God.
You poor thing.

784
00:34:53,490 --> 00:34:55,549
You must have been in shock.

785
00:34:55,592 --> 00:34:57,321
He had it coming.

786
00:34:57,361 --> 00:34:59,761
I see.
It was a close marriage.

787
00:34:59,796 --> 00:35:01,764
It was exciting for a while.

788
00:35:01,798 --> 00:35:03,959
You never knew
what would happen next.

789
00:35:04,001 --> 00:35:06,094
That kind of excitement
I can live without.

790
00:35:06,136 --> 00:35:08,696
He was tough, good-Iookin'...

791
00:35:08,739 --> 00:35:10,707
What did he tell you he did?

792
00:35:10,741 --> 00:35:12,572
A juice man for the mob.

793
00:35:12,609 --> 00:35:14,440
He made juice for the mob?

794
00:35:14,478 --> 00:35:17,743
Juice man. He collected
for the loan sharks.

795
00:35:17,781 --> 00:35:21,148
So now Danny's
driving along with Tina.

796
00:35:21,184 --> 00:35:23,584
They're talking.
What they don't know...

797
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:25,520
is two minutes after they
left the party...

798
00:35:25,555 --> 00:35:28,490
there was this little scene
with Johnny's brothers...

799
00:35:28,525 --> 00:35:31,551
Joe and Vito,
both hitmen for the mob.

800
00:35:31,595 --> 00:35:34,223
Their mother is outraged
and humiliated...

801
00:35:34,264 --> 00:35:37,199
over what's been happening
with Danny Rose...

802
00:35:37,234 --> 00:35:39,998
who they call
"Danny White Roses."

803
00:35:40,037 --> 00:35:42,505
Don't worry, Mama.
Just leave him to us.

804
00:35:42,539 --> 00:35:46,407
Your brother is soft.
He's sensitive.

805
00:35:46,443 --> 00:35:48,877
Her husband had
no respect for us, either.

806
00:35:48,912 --> 00:35:50,971
He was no damn good.
He cheated us.

807
00:35:51,014 --> 00:35:53,278
And she's no better.

808
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:57,014
She said one thing to my face,
then betrayed me.

809
00:35:57,054 --> 00:36:01,081
The lover's got her
under his spell, Johnny.

810
00:36:01,124 --> 00:36:04,093
- We'll fix him.
- We'll chop his legs off.

811
00:36:04,127 --> 00:36:06,755
We'll kill him.
I don't trust him.

812
00:36:06,797 --> 00:36:09,732
But not Tina.
Please, not Tina.

813
00:36:09,766 --> 00:36:14,499
Get rid of the lover,
and you get her back.

814
00:36:14,538 --> 00:36:17,006
He's got the evil eye.

815
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:20,703
Figlio mio e malocchio.
You understand?

816
00:36:20,744 --> 00:36:23,577
Mama, he's a dead man.

817
00:36:23,613 --> 00:36:26,548
I'll just have an iced coffee.

818
00:36:26,583 --> 00:36:28,551
I'll have milk.
Large glass, sweetheart.

819
00:36:28,585 --> 00:36:32,043
I got an ulcer. I shouldn't
have drank at the party.

820
00:36:32,089 --> 00:36:34,751
My ex-husband had an ulcer.

821
00:36:34,791 --> 00:36:38,784
They say it's stress,
an entire mental syndrome.

822
00:36:38,829 --> 00:36:43,562
Carmine was always afraid they
would shoot him in the back.

823
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:47,502
He was wrong, so...

824
00:36:47,537 --> 00:36:49,471
Who else you handle besides Lou?

825
00:36:49,506 --> 00:36:54,569
Me? I got various
interesting artists.

826
00:36:54,611 --> 00:37:00,072
I got a very wonderful,
blind xylophone player.

827
00:37:00,117 --> 00:37:02,813
I'm currently working
with a parrot...

828
00:37:02,853 --> 00:37:05,788
that sings "I Gotta Be Me."

829
00:37:05,822 --> 00:37:08,689
And I got some very nice
balloon folders.

830
00:37:08,725 --> 00:37:10,192
It's interesting.

831
00:37:10,227 --> 00:37:12,024
No big shots, right?

832
00:37:12,062 --> 00:37:14,121
I've discovered
certain artists...

833
00:37:14,164 --> 00:37:17,600
that have gone on
to better things.

834
00:37:17,634 --> 00:37:20,330
But they all leave you, right?
How come?

835
00:37:20,370 --> 00:37:23,498
I got a theory about that.

836
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:26,008
I think they get a swelled head.

837
00:37:26,042 --> 00:37:29,011
People like to forget
their beginnings...

838
00:37:29,045 --> 00:37:31,513
and they just split.

839
00:37:31,548 --> 00:37:33,379
You must be doing
something wrong...

840
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:34,850
if everybody leaves you.

841
00:37:34,885 --> 00:37:38,377
What am I doing wrong?
I find 'em. I discover 'em.

842
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:41,220
I breathe life into them,
and then they go.

843
00:37:41,258 --> 00:37:43,522
They don't feel guilty.
They just split.

844
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:46,495
Guilty? What the hell is that?

845
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:47,895
They see something better...

846
00:37:47,931 --> 00:37:50,491
and they grab it.
Who's got time for guilt?

847
00:37:50,534 --> 00:37:53,025
It's important to feel guilty.

848
00:37:53,069 --> 00:37:56,402
Otherwise, you're capable
of terrible things.

849
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,567
It's very important
to be guilty.

850
00:37:58,608 --> 00:38:01,634
I'm guilty all the time,
and I never did anything.

851
00:38:01,678 --> 00:38:06,547
My rabbi used to say we're
all guilty in the eyes of God.

852
00:38:06,583 --> 00:38:08,676
You believe in God?

853
00:38:08,718 --> 00:38:11,516
No, but I'm guilty over it.

854
00:38:11,555 --> 00:38:13,489
I never feel guilty.

855
00:38:13,523 --> 00:38:16,549
You got to do
what you got to do.

856
00:38:16,593 --> 00:38:18,117
Life's short.

857
00:38:18,161 --> 00:38:20,686
You don't get any medals
for being a Boy Scout.

858
00:38:20,730 --> 00:38:22,994
Do me a favor. Don't give
this information to Lou...

859
00:38:23,033 --> 00:38:25,001
because I got enough problems.

860
00:38:25,035 --> 00:38:27,060
Danny, don't move.
Let's get up slowly...

861
00:38:27,103 --> 00:38:31,005
and get out of here...
out the back door.

862
00:38:31,041 --> 00:38:32,770
I don't understand.
What's out there?

863
00:38:32,809 --> 00:38:34,037
Johnny's brothers.

864
00:38:34,077 --> 00:38:36,204
Johnny... you mean
the guy with the iodine?

865
00:38:36,246 --> 00:38:38,180
They're crazy,
that whole family.

866
00:38:38,215 --> 00:38:41,116
Because they think
I'm your lover?

867
00:38:41,151 --> 00:38:43,051
They'll tear the tongue
out of your head.

868
00:38:43,086 --> 00:38:44,383
I'm just a beard.

869
00:38:44,421 --> 00:38:47,413
They'll tear the tongue
out of the beard?

870
00:38:47,457 --> 00:38:50,517
Throw some money down.
Let's get out of here.

871
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:53,028
I only got ten bucks.

872
00:38:53,063 --> 00:38:55,031
Leave it. Come on, will ya?

873
00:38:55,065 --> 00:38:57,556
We're going to leave
an eight and a half dollar tip.

874
00:38:57,601 --> 00:39:00,570
There ought to be a delivery
entrance out here somewhere.

875
00:39:00,604 --> 00:39:02,572
Eight and a half bucks.
For that kinda dough...

876
00:39:02,606 --> 00:39:04,631
I could get the waitress
to sleep with me.

877
00:39:04,674 --> 00:39:06,699
Where's the... there it is.

878
00:39:06,743 --> 00:39:08,472
Don't get up, fellas.

879
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:10,946
Keep turning out the junk food.

880
00:39:13,083 --> 00:39:15,017
Come on, this way.

881
00:39:15,051 --> 00:39:16,518
I don't like this.

882
00:39:16,553 --> 00:39:19,488
Darling, may I interject
one statement?

883
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:21,491
I don't like what's going on.

884
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:23,390
Christ.

885
00:39:23,426 --> 00:39:25,053
Better go down there.

886
00:39:25,095 --> 00:39:27,359
What the hell
did you get me into?

887
00:39:27,397 --> 00:39:28,864
Do what I'm telling you...

888
00:39:28,899 --> 00:39:31,026
or you'll wind up
on a meat hook.

889
00:39:31,067 --> 00:39:34,696
A meat hook?
I'll go first.

890
00:39:34,738 --> 00:39:37,969
- I'm angry, Tina.
- Come on!

891
00:39:38,008 --> 00:39:41,341
I'm telling ya, I'm angry!
I'm really fuming.

892
00:39:41,378 --> 00:39:45,212
Just feel free to dig your heel
into my groin like that.

893
00:39:45,248 --> 00:39:46,738
Just...

894
00:40:08,171 --> 00:40:11,038
So Danny and Tina, they run.

895
00:40:11,074 --> 00:40:13,542
What's he going to do?

896
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:15,545
Now, he's not only scared.

897
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:18,047
The man is pissed off.

898
00:40:18,081 --> 00:40:20,549
Sure, because he
didn't do anything.

899
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:25,044
You got it. Wait.
Cut to a half-hour later.

900
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:27,556
Now they're lost,
and he's furious.

901
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:30,059
He's getting on her nerves.

902
00:40:30,093 --> 00:40:32,357
She's getting on his nerves.

903
00:40:32,395 --> 00:40:35,057
Jesus, where the hell are we?

904
00:40:35,098 --> 00:40:36,725
All right! Take it easy.

905
00:40:36,766 --> 00:40:38,597
Don't tell me
to take it easy...

906
00:40:38,635 --> 00:40:40,603
because I've had
enough already today.

907
00:40:40,637 --> 00:40:43,606
I'm a personal manager.
I got a big night ahead.

908
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:46,609
Meanwhile I'm wandering around
in North Vietnam.

909
00:40:46,643 --> 00:40:48,110
We got away, didn't we?

910
00:40:48,144 --> 00:40:50,112
I've got nothing
to get away from.

911
00:40:50,146 --> 00:40:51,613
I didn't do anything.

912
00:40:51,648 --> 00:40:53,616
I got more running
all of a sudden...

913
00:40:53,650 --> 00:40:56,050
with fortune tellers
and meat hooks and...

914
00:40:56,086 --> 00:40:58,714
I'll take care of it
when we get a phone.

915
00:40:58,755 --> 00:41:00,450
A phone? We're in a swamp.

916
00:41:00,490 --> 00:41:02,617
Where is there going
to be a phone here?

917
00:41:02,659 --> 00:41:05,685
She shacks up with Lou,
and they wanna break my legs.

918
00:41:05,729 --> 00:41:07,629
I don't have to go tonight.

919
00:41:07,664 --> 00:41:09,564
That's fine with me.
Then don't...

920
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:11,931
because I'm too scared
around you anyhow.

921
00:41:11,968 --> 00:41:13,902
Lou, honey,
don't drink like that.

922
00:41:13,937 --> 00:41:15,837
You've got
an important show tonight.

923
00:41:15,872 --> 00:41:17,499
I got a cold sore.

924
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:19,303
Look at this thing over here.

925
00:41:19,342 --> 00:41:20,866
Oh, it's nothing.

926
00:41:20,910 --> 00:41:22,571
It's got to be tonight.

927
00:41:22,612 --> 00:41:25,479
And those Vegas people,
they notice everything.

928
00:41:25,515 --> 00:41:28,177
They're pros.
They got it down to a science.

929
00:41:28,218 --> 00:41:29,742
Turn on the ball game.

930
00:41:29,786 --> 00:41:32,755
I can't decide to go with
"Boulevard of Broken Dreams"...

931
00:41:32,789 --> 00:41:36,418
or "Three Coins in the Fountain"
as an encore. I don't know.

932
00:41:36,459 --> 00:41:39,087
The kids are driving me
nuts over here.

933
00:41:39,129 --> 00:41:41,154
Gimme a break over here.

934
00:41:41,197 --> 00:41:44,598
I wonder where Danny is.
I'm waiting for his call.

935
00:41:44,634 --> 00:41:46,192
Where is Danny?

936
00:41:46,236 --> 00:41:48,864
Went to pick up his date
in Jersey.

937
00:41:48,905 --> 00:41:50,805
I guess he got
tied up in traffic.

938
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,273
Who's his date?

939
00:41:52,308 --> 00:41:54,299
How do I know? Some broad.

940
00:41:54,344 --> 00:41:56,642
Jesus, we're
in the middle of nowhere.

941
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,773
I never saw so many
reeds in my life.

942
00:41:58,815 --> 00:42:00,442
I feel like Moses.

943
00:42:00,483 --> 00:42:02,110
Lou's probably worried sick.

944
00:42:02,152 --> 00:42:03,949
Darling,
Lou's probably drinking...

945
00:42:03,987 --> 00:42:06,581
out of the promotional-size
whiskey bottle.

946
00:42:06,623 --> 00:42:08,716
I know where we are.

947
00:42:08,758 --> 00:42:10,555
These are the flatlands.

948
00:42:10,593 --> 00:42:13,061
My husband's friends
dump bodies here.

949
00:42:13,096 --> 00:42:16,827
I'm sure you can show me
the points of cultural interest.

950
00:42:16,866 --> 00:42:18,731
Hey, who are you?

951
00:42:18,768 --> 00:42:21,293
Who are you?

952
00:42:21,337 --> 00:42:23,396
Who are you?

953
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,465
We're lost.

954
00:42:25,508 --> 00:42:28,739
We're shooting a commercial
down by the river.

955
00:42:28,778 --> 00:42:30,075
Fantastic! Unbelievable!

956
00:42:30,113 --> 00:42:32,081
What a break!

957
00:42:32,115 --> 00:42:35,107
I'm Danny Rose,
theatrical management.

958
00:42:35,151 --> 00:42:38,314
- God bless you. This is Tina...
- Vitale.

959
00:42:38,354 --> 00:42:40,948
I'm Ray Webb, the actor.

960
00:42:40,990 --> 00:42:42,924
Listen, we got to get a car.

961
00:42:42,959 --> 00:42:46,087
There are no cars here
until tonight.

962
00:42:46,129 --> 00:42:48,097
It's an emergency.

963
00:42:48,131 --> 00:42:50,759
I've got to see
Berle at the Waldorf.

964
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:55,931
Yeah? Your best bet...
there's a guy with a boat.

965
00:42:55,972 --> 00:42:58,566
Give him a few bucks.
He'll take you across.

966
00:42:58,608 --> 00:43:00,974
- Great.
- I don't travel by water.

967
00:43:01,010 --> 00:43:02,307
It's against my religion.

968
00:43:02,345 --> 00:43:03,778
I'm a land-Iocked people.

969
00:43:03,813 --> 00:43:05,781
Tina, you ever seen me
on television?

970
00:43:05,815 --> 00:43:08,716
I play the shaving-cream man
from outer space.

971
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:10,481
Come on, Danny.

972
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:13,887
We've got to take this boat.
Lou's waiting. Come on.

973
00:43:13,923 --> 00:43:15,891
Five minutes
to cross the Hudson.

974
00:43:15,925 --> 00:43:19,088
You want me to go on
the Hudson River? That's crazy.

975
00:43:19,129 --> 00:43:21,063
How did you get here
without a car?

976
00:43:21,097 --> 00:43:22,564
What about that?

977
00:43:22,599 --> 00:43:24,533
I been through thick
and thin with that car...

978
00:43:24,567 --> 00:43:27,058
now I gotta leave it
at the diner overnight?

979
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:32,336
If anything happens to that car,
I'll be furious, Tina.

980
00:43:39,883 --> 00:43:43,250
Now they're gonna go back
to Manhattan by boat.

981
00:43:43,286 --> 00:43:45,584
A boat, mind you.

982
00:43:45,622 --> 00:43:47,920
Can you picture Danny Rose
on a boat?

983
00:43:47,957 --> 00:43:50,755
I mean, this guy
is strictly pavement.

984
00:43:50,794 --> 00:43:53,524
He needs the smell
of carbon monoxide and litter...

985
00:43:53,563 --> 00:43:54,894
to feel good.

986
00:43:54,931 --> 00:43:57,092
Danny is not meant for water.

987
00:43:57,133 --> 00:44:00,102
So naturally, the minute
he steps on the boat...

988
00:44:00,136 --> 00:44:02,104
he's gone.

989
00:44:02,138 --> 00:44:04,333
A lunch he ate in 1956...

990
00:44:04,374 --> 00:44:06,433
is beginning to come up on him.

991
00:44:06,476 --> 00:44:08,171
He's green. He's dizzy.

992
00:44:08,211 --> 00:44:10,543
Tina's fine.
She's made of steel.

993
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:12,844
I'll tell you what's
going through her mind.

994
00:44:12,882 --> 00:44:14,873
She's thinking
of the conversation...

995
00:44:14,918 --> 00:44:17,443
that she and Lou
had a week before.

996
00:44:17,487 --> 00:44:20,513
All right!

997
00:44:20,557 --> 00:44:24,015
Lou, I don't want
you to break up...

998
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:26,028
with your wife because of me.

999
00:44:26,062 --> 00:44:29,554
Tina, it's not you.
This has been on my mind.

1000
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:31,567
But I'd feel like
a home wrecker.

1001
00:44:31,601 --> 00:44:33,899
I got to change
my whole lifestyle.

1002
00:44:33,937 --> 00:44:36,565
The thing you gotta
change is your manager.

1003
00:44:36,606 --> 00:44:38,574
That's what you gotta change.

1004
00:44:38,608 --> 00:44:40,576
Listen, Danny's all right.

1005
00:44:40,610 --> 00:44:43,238
He's no world beater,
but he's all right.

1006
00:44:43,279 --> 00:44:45,270
I don't know anything
about show business...

1007
00:44:45,315 --> 00:44:47,875
and I got nothing
against the guy.

1008
00:44:47,917 --> 00:44:51,580
But I see the joints you work
and the way things are going.

1009
00:44:51,621 --> 00:44:53,919
You're better than
all these new guys.

1010
00:44:53,957 --> 00:44:56,551
You're prejudiced
'cause you like me.

1011
00:44:56,593 --> 00:45:01,428
Danny would be lost without me.
He's counting on me.

1012
00:45:01,464 --> 00:45:04,592
Let me introduce you
to Sid Bacharach.

1013
00:45:04,634 --> 00:45:06,602
How do you know Sid Bacharach?

1014
00:45:06,636 --> 00:45:08,695
Why would he give me
five minutes of his time?

1015
00:45:08,738 --> 00:45:10,535
He was good friends
with my husband.

1016
00:45:10,573 --> 00:45:12,473
They were very tight
in Atlantic City.

1017
00:45:12,508 --> 00:45:15,534
- Sid Bacharach?
- He's a big guy, right?

1018
00:45:15,578 --> 00:45:18,103
Big gun.
No two ways about it.

1019
00:45:18,147 --> 00:45:22,516
Now they're in the middle
of the Hudson River.

1020
00:45:22,552 --> 00:45:25,020
The fog has come in.

1021
00:45:25,054 --> 00:45:27,522
Danny's face is...
what color should I say?

1022
00:45:27,557 --> 00:45:29,582
It's khaki.
The man has a khaki face.

1023
00:45:29,626 --> 00:45:33,255
So what are you saying?
Tina wanted Lou to leave Danny?

1024
00:45:33,296 --> 00:45:36,231
That's exactly what I'm saying.
Three days earlier...

1025
00:45:36,266 --> 00:45:38,234
Tina had set up
a secret lunch meeting...

1026
00:45:38,268 --> 00:45:40,361
at some steak joint
in Manhattan.

1027
00:45:40,403 --> 00:45:42,564
Well, guys,
we finally made it.

1028
00:45:42,605 --> 00:45:45,574
Lou Canova, Sid Bacharach.
Sid, this is Lou.

1029
00:45:45,608 --> 00:45:47,075
Pleasure, Mr. Bacharach.

1030
00:45:47,110 --> 00:45:51,046
I've heard wonderful things
about you from my girl.

1031
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:54,049
You remember Lou
from the fifties.

1032
00:45:54,083 --> 00:45:56,551
I remember
"Tossin' and Turnin'."

1033
00:45:56,586 --> 00:45:59,555
That thing on Perfidia, too.

1034
00:45:59,589 --> 00:46:02,080
I understand you already
have representation.

1035
00:46:02,125 --> 00:46:03,558
Yeah, I do.

1036
00:46:03,593 --> 00:46:05,584
He's loyal to a guy
who means well...

1037
00:46:05,628 --> 00:46:07,596
but he can't seem to move him.

1038
00:46:07,630 --> 00:46:09,530
I know all about those things.

1039
00:46:09,565 --> 00:46:11,032
Sometimes it just
doesn't work out...

1040
00:46:11,067 --> 00:46:13,001
and he can't help you.

1041
00:46:13,036 --> 00:46:16,005
It's my career.
It's my life.

1042
00:46:16,039 --> 00:46:19,031
I really want
to catch your act.

1043
00:46:19,075 --> 00:46:21,543
The nostalgia thing
is really coming on strong.

1044
00:46:21,577 --> 00:46:23,044
He's hot now.

1045
00:46:23,079 --> 00:46:25,377
I'll be at the
Waldorf on the twenty-fifth.

1046
00:46:25,415 --> 00:46:27,713
It would be great
if you could come, Sid.

1047
00:46:27,750 --> 00:46:29,718
All he needs is somebody
with a little clout...

1048
00:46:29,752 --> 00:46:31,583
to open some doors.

1049
00:46:31,621 --> 00:46:34,522
I'll do my best
to make it on Sunday night.

1050
00:46:34,557 --> 00:46:37,390
Don't worry about it.
I'll get you in the back.

1051
00:46:37,427 --> 00:46:38,758
You won't regret it.

1052
00:46:42,732 --> 00:46:44,700
So Tina's thinking
about all this stuff...

1053
00:46:44,734 --> 00:46:47,202
while they're sailing
back across the Hudson.

1054
00:46:47,236 --> 00:46:50,205
Meanwhile, the two crazy
brothers are in New York...

1055
00:46:50,239 --> 00:46:51,706
Iooking to kill Danny.

1056
00:46:51,741 --> 00:46:53,208
I don't get it.

1057
00:46:53,242 --> 00:46:55,710
Wasn't Tina going
to have them called off?

1058
00:46:55,745 --> 00:46:57,713
She did,
the minute they got ashore.

1059
00:46:57,747 --> 00:46:59,044
But it didn't work.

1060
00:46:59,082 --> 00:47:00,549
So what's happening?

1061
00:47:00,583 --> 00:47:02,380
You have to lay low for a while.

1062
00:47:02,418 --> 00:47:03,715
What do you mean?

1063
00:47:03,753 --> 00:47:05,721
You got any friends out of town?

1064
00:47:05,755 --> 00:47:07,723
Out of town?
Where? Are you nuts?

1065
00:47:07,757 --> 00:47:09,384
You'd better check into a hotel.

1066
00:47:09,425 --> 00:47:12,394
You said you were going to
settle this with one phone call.

1067
00:47:12,428 --> 00:47:14,396
It will be,
but it'll take a few days.

1068
00:47:14,430 --> 00:47:16,421
Meanwhile,
they're looking for you.

1069
00:47:16,466 --> 00:47:19,230
Darling, can I say one thing?
I'm going to the police.

1070
00:47:19,268 --> 00:47:21,736
That's a mistake.
You got to lay low.

1071
00:47:21,771 --> 00:47:24,569
What are you talking about?
I didn't do anything!

1072
00:47:24,607 --> 00:47:27,405
My whole life I never got
involved in any trouble.

1073
00:47:27,443 --> 00:47:29,411
I ate the right foods.
Now I gotta lay low?

1074
00:47:29,445 --> 00:47:31,413
Jesus, you said one phone call.

1075
00:47:31,447 --> 00:47:35,281
It's gonna be taken care of.
I got someone onto it.

1076
00:47:35,318 --> 00:47:37,252
My advice is to check
into a hotel.

1077
00:47:37,286 --> 00:47:39,413
I got an apartment.
Why do I need a hotel?

1078
00:47:39,455 --> 00:47:42,515
You can't go back there
for a few days.

1079
00:47:42,558 --> 00:47:46,187
I'm gonna spend for a hotel
with an apartment? Are you nuts?

1080
00:47:46,229 --> 00:47:48,197
It's a mix-up.
Just don't go home.

1081
00:47:48,231 --> 00:47:50,699
I've got to go home.
You're bad news, honey.

1082
00:47:50,733 --> 00:47:52,200
I knew that when I came in...

1083
00:47:52,235 --> 00:47:54,226
and you were starting with
the ice pick.

1084
00:47:54,270 --> 00:47:56,204
Nice girls don't screw around
with ice picks.

1085
00:47:56,239 --> 00:47:57,706
They got ribbons!

1086
00:47:57,740 --> 00:47:59,207
Just don't go home.

1087
00:47:59,242 --> 00:48:01,210
I gotta go home
and get my pills...

1088
00:48:01,244 --> 00:48:03,212
and my shorts,
and Lou, the poor guy...

1089
00:48:03,246 --> 00:48:04,736
he's probably a wreck!

1090
00:48:07,083 --> 00:48:14,216
I'm not drunk. I'm OK.

1091
00:48:14,257 --> 00:48:17,226
I'm going to be all right.

1092
00:48:17,260 --> 00:48:19,228
Where you been?
I'm going crazy.

1093
00:48:19,262 --> 00:48:20,820
Where's Tina?

1094
00:48:20,863 --> 00:48:25,732
Lou, take some black coffee
and get over to the Waldorf.

1095
00:48:25,768 --> 00:48:27,736
She's here.
Will you speak to him?

1096
00:48:27,770 --> 00:48:29,738
'Cause he's lost.
He's gone already.

1097
00:48:29,772 --> 00:48:31,740
Lou, I'll be there.

1098
00:48:31,774 --> 00:48:34,242
Just do what Danny says.

1099
00:48:34,277 --> 00:48:38,737
Of course I miss you, but will
you lay off the sauce?

1100
00:48:38,781 --> 00:48:41,682
He's drunk.
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

1101
00:48:41,717 --> 00:48:43,582
I knew this would happen.

1102
00:48:43,619 --> 00:48:45,018
Where are my pills?

1103
00:48:45,054 --> 00:48:48,353
I need a valium
the size of a hockey puck.

1104
00:48:48,391 --> 00:48:50,188
Who is this here?

1105
00:48:50,226 --> 00:48:52,194
That's Frank,
Tony Bennett, and me.

1106
00:48:52,228 --> 00:48:53,991
This was a big night.

1107
00:48:54,030 --> 00:48:57,090
See the little smudge?
That's my head.

1108
00:48:57,133 --> 00:48:59,431
There I am with
Miss Judy Garland.

1109
00:48:59,469 --> 00:49:02,063
Never a dearer woman existed.

1110
00:49:02,105 --> 00:49:04,039
Where are you?

1111
00:49:04,073 --> 00:49:06,041
I'm right outside the frame.

1112
00:49:06,075 --> 00:49:09,636
If the picture went another
inch, I was behind the dais.

1113
00:49:09,679 --> 00:49:11,544
Then here's Mr. Myron Coen.

1114
00:49:11,581 --> 00:49:14,049
Jesus, where is
my bottle of pills?

1115
00:49:14,083 --> 00:49:16,051
How long have you
had this joint?

1116
00:49:16,085 --> 00:49:18,053
What do you mean joint?

1117
00:49:18,087 --> 00:49:20,055
This is rent controlled.
This is fine.

1118
00:49:20,089 --> 00:49:22,717
You ought to fix it up.
You're living like a loser.

1119
00:49:22,758 --> 00:49:26,216
Nobody ever comes over,
so what do I care?

1120
00:49:26,262 --> 00:49:28,787
Nobody comes over?
You ever been married?

1121
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:30,799
I was engaged to a dancer...

1122
00:49:30,833 --> 00:49:33,461
but she ran away
with a piano player...

1123
00:49:33,503 --> 00:49:35,403
and I broke off with her.

1124
00:49:35,438 --> 00:49:37,406
You know what I'd do
with this room?

1125
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:39,408
- What?
- Liven it up.

1126
00:49:39,442 --> 00:49:42,843
Do it all in something up,
pink maybe.

1127
00:49:42,879 --> 00:49:46,007
- Pink?
- You got to lighten it up.

1128
00:49:46,048 --> 00:49:49,017
Pink with maybe
some gold wallpaper.

1129
00:49:49,051 --> 00:49:52,179
Then, you need fabric,
big purple pillows.

1130
00:49:52,221 --> 00:49:54,189
Maybe some incense.

1131
00:49:54,223 --> 00:49:57,192
What is this,
a Turkish whorehouse?

1132
00:49:57,226 --> 00:49:58,523
I live here, darling.

1133
00:49:58,561 --> 00:50:00,495
I'm serious.
You gotta lighten it up.

1134
00:50:00,530 --> 00:50:02,430
Maybe some bamboo furniture.

1135
00:50:02,465 --> 00:50:07,198
I always wanted to do a room
in bamboo with zebra skins.

1136
00:50:07,236 --> 00:50:09,033
Really? You're serious?

1137
00:50:09,071 --> 00:50:10,698
Why not? It's exciting.

1138
00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:13,470
You're talking about
a tropical motif?

1139
00:50:13,509 --> 00:50:17,036
It's funny because
actually I like bamboo.

1140
00:50:17,079 --> 00:50:18,546
Really?

1141
00:50:18,581 --> 00:50:22,381
Picture hanging plants maybe,
and a really nice tile floor.

1142
00:50:22,418 --> 00:50:25,387
Bamboo furniture is very
beautiful and very dramatic.

1143
00:50:25,421 --> 00:50:27,048
You got an eye for drama.

1144
00:50:27,089 --> 00:50:28,556
Really? You really think so?

1145
00:50:28,591 --> 00:50:30,559
I do. Yeah.
You sound surprised.

1146
00:50:30,593 --> 00:50:33,562
Nobody ever liked
my African jungle idea before.

1147
00:50:33,596 --> 00:50:34,824
It's great.

1148
00:50:34,864 --> 00:50:37,230
You're the first person
ever liked it.

1149
00:50:37,266 --> 00:50:40,235
I'm willing to bet that
you're full of good ideas...

1150
00:50:40,269 --> 00:50:43,170
but you don't have
any confidence.

1151
00:50:43,206 --> 00:50:45,174
My big problem
as a decorator...

1152
00:50:45,208 --> 00:50:46,675
I got no confidence.

1153
00:50:46,709 --> 00:50:49,177
It's like the acts I handle.
If I was handling you...

1154
00:50:49,212 --> 00:50:51,442
I could straighten
you out in no time.

1155
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:54,540
I don't see you just
decorating little joints...

1156
00:50:54,584 --> 00:50:56,609
in little apartments
in the suburbs.

1157
00:50:56,652 --> 00:51:00,349
I see you doing your gold walls
and your Turkish pillows...

1158
00:51:00,389 --> 00:51:04,189
and your... all that garbage
in hotels and embassies.

1159
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:05,489
Really?

1160
00:51:05,528 --> 00:51:07,689
You could, I can smell it.

1161
00:51:07,730 --> 00:51:10,028
The boat sailed for me.

1162
00:51:10,066 --> 00:51:13,035
I shoulda been more
serious when I was younger.

1163
00:51:13,069 --> 00:51:16,527
Younger? You got
your whole life ahead of you.

1164
00:51:16,572 --> 00:51:19,541
I look at my work,
and I think it's ugly.

1165
00:51:19,575 --> 00:51:22,703
My Uncle Morris, a famous
diabetic from Brooklyn...

1166
00:51:22,745 --> 00:51:24,713
used to say,
"If you hate yourself...

1167
00:51:24,747 --> 00:51:27,215
then you hate your work."

1168
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:30,378
I sleep at night.
It's you that's got the ulcer.

1169
00:51:30,419 --> 00:51:32,387
Yeah, but it may be
a good thing.

1170
00:51:32,421 --> 00:51:34,548
You know what my
philosophy of life is?

1171
00:51:34,590 --> 00:51:36,717
It's important
to have some laughs...

1172
00:51:36,759 --> 00:51:38,727
but you got to suffer
a little, too...

1173
00:51:38,761 --> 00:51:42,288
because otherwise you miss
the whole point of life.

1174
00:51:42,331 --> 00:51:43,696
Know what
my philosophy of life is?

1175
00:51:43,733 --> 00:51:45,166
Oh, I can imagine.

1176
00:51:45,201 --> 00:51:47,192
It's over quick,
so have a good time.

1177
00:51:47,236 --> 00:51:48,828
You see what you want,
go for it.

1178
00:51:48,871 --> 00:51:50,270
Don't pay any attention
to anybody else...

1179
00:51:50,306 --> 00:51:51,603
and do it
to the other guy first...

1180
00:51:51,641 --> 00:51:53,905
'cause if you don't,
he'll do it to you.

1181
00:51:53,943 --> 00:51:55,467
This is a philosophy of life?

1182
00:51:55,511 --> 00:51:59,379
This sounds like the screenplay
to Murder Incorporated.

1183
00:51:59,415 --> 00:52:00,905
Hold this a second.
That's ridiculous.

1184
00:52:00,950 --> 00:52:02,850
No wonder
you don't like yourself.

1185
00:52:02,885 --> 00:52:05,115
Stop saying that.
I like myself fine.

1186
00:52:05,154 --> 00:52:07,850
I'm just saying down deep
I sense that you don't.

1187
00:52:07,890 --> 00:52:10,120
You're the one
that's living like a loser.

1188
00:52:10,159 --> 00:52:11,626
Why, because I haven't made it?

1189
00:52:11,661 --> 00:52:14,027
You see, that's the beauty
of this business.

1190
00:52:14,063 --> 00:52:16,429
Overnight,
you can go from a bum to a hero.

1191
00:52:16,465 --> 00:52:18,365
I think it's gonna happen now
with Lou.

1192
00:52:18,401 --> 00:52:20,062
We'd better get goin'.
Hurry up.

1193
00:52:20,102 --> 00:52:22,935
Just let me say one thing.
My Uncle Sidney...

1194
00:52:22,972 --> 00:52:25,873
lovely uncle. Dead. Completely...
used to say three things.

1195
00:52:25,908 --> 00:52:28,399
He used to say, "Acceptance,
forgiveness, and love."

1196
00:52:28,444 --> 00:52:30,173
And that
is a philosophy of life.

1197
00:52:30,212 --> 00:52:31,873
Acceptance, forgiveness,
and love.

1198
00:52:31,914 --> 00:52:34,212
So there's where it is.

1199
00:52:34,250 --> 00:52:36,514
So tell me more about
the bamboo room. I love it.

1200
00:52:50,466 --> 00:52:52,263
I'm gonna stay one night...

1201
00:52:52,301 --> 00:52:53,768
'cause I don't wanna incur
expense.

1202
00:52:53,803 --> 00:52:55,065
Listen, I'm going to make
a phone call.

1203
00:52:55,104 --> 00:52:56,935
I got another idea.

1204
00:53:09,218 --> 00:53:10,981
How much is a single room?

1205
00:53:11,020 --> 00:53:12,715
Sorry, all filled up.

1206
00:53:33,242 --> 00:53:34,641
Tina, darling.

1207
00:53:53,229 --> 00:53:55,197
Come on. Get in the car.

1208
00:54:03,272 --> 00:54:04,432
Come on.

1209
00:54:16,685 --> 00:54:21,588
Fellas... fellas, may... may I
just interject one thing...

1210
00:54:21,624 --> 00:54:22,989
at this particular point
in time?

1211
00:54:23,025 --> 00:54:24,151
Keep going straight.

1212
00:54:24,193 --> 00:54:27,253
Look, I like Johnny.
I like your brother.

1213
00:54:27,296 --> 00:54:29,491
I got nothin' against him.
I just met him today.

1214
00:54:29,532 --> 00:54:31,193
I liked his poem.

1215
00:54:31,233 --> 00:54:34,396
What's under discussion here
is the girl's feelings.

1216
00:54:34,437 --> 00:54:35,836
Incidentally, where is the girl?

1217
00:54:35,871 --> 00:54:38,032
We're gonna take
real good care of you, pal.

1218
00:54:38,073 --> 00:54:39,335
I want to say one thing...

1219
00:54:39,375 --> 00:54:42,833
and I don't mean to be didactic
or facetious in any manner.

1220
00:54:42,878 --> 00:54:46,177
She doesn't love him.
She doesn't love him anymore.

1221
00:54:46,215 --> 00:54:48,183
I know it's hard to take...

1222
00:54:48,217 --> 00:54:51,152
because we all want
what we can't have in life.

1223
00:54:51,187 --> 00:54:54,714
It's an actual thing.
Take my cousin, Ceil.

1224
00:54:54,757 --> 00:54:56,691
Not pretty like Tina at all.

1225
00:54:56,725 --> 00:54:58,693
She looked like something
in the reptile house in the zoo.

1226
00:54:58,727 --> 00:55:01,059
So... you'll like this story...
she meets this accountant...

1227
00:55:01,096 --> 00:55:02,393
Will you shut up!

1228
00:55:13,742 --> 00:55:18,770
No. Wait. Wait. No.
Listen, you misunderstand me.

1229
00:55:18,814 --> 00:55:20,372
God damn you!

1230
00:55:23,385 --> 00:55:27,151
Fellas, fellas, I'm a veteran.
I'm a veteran.

1231
00:55:27,189 --> 00:55:30,249
- Get the ax.
- There's an ax?

1232
00:55:30,292 --> 00:55:31,759
Fellas, I'm the beard.

1233
00:55:31,794 --> 00:55:33,694
I'm just the beard.
You don't understand.

1234
00:55:33,729 --> 00:55:37,187
He's telling the truth.
He has nothing to do with this.

1235
00:55:37,233 --> 00:55:39,895
You don't believe me, right?

1236
00:55:39,935 --> 00:55:41,027
We're going
to chop your legs off.

1237
00:55:41,070 --> 00:55:43,538
Fellas, I'm only the beard.

1238
00:55:43,572 --> 00:55:46,541
Would I waste my time
with a guy like this?

1239
00:55:46,575 --> 00:55:48,099
OK, then who?

1240
00:55:48,143 --> 00:55:50,577
You want him to walk outta here,
give us a name.

1241
00:55:50,613 --> 00:55:53,514
- I'm not talking.
- You tell us, you punk.

1242
00:55:53,549 --> 00:55:56,677
You don't want me
to rat on a friend.

1243
00:55:56,719 --> 00:56:00,621
Let me quote Rabbi Hershel,
an extremely learned man...

1244
00:56:00,656 --> 00:56:02,487
Who are you bearding for?

1245
00:56:02,525 --> 00:56:04,891
I'm not the guy.
Isn't that enough?

1246
00:56:04,927 --> 00:56:06,417
Whatever happens to him,
you two are dead men.

1247
00:56:06,462 --> 00:56:08,054
Oh, yeah? Come on, tell us.

1248
00:56:08,097 --> 00:56:10,156
Who are you bearding for,
you little cheese-eater?

1249
00:56:10,199 --> 00:56:12,861
Cheese-eater. I don't know
exactly what it means...

1250
00:56:12,902 --> 00:56:14,597
but I know it's not good.

1251
00:56:14,637 --> 00:56:15,934
Who are you bearding for?

1252
00:56:15,971 --> 00:56:18,064
I'll put a bullet
right between her eyes!

1253
00:56:18,107 --> 00:56:19,665
Don't do that! I'll talk.

1254
00:56:19,708 --> 00:56:21,505
Danny, don't! They'll kill him!

1255
00:56:21,544 --> 00:56:22,977
I don't want to get
my legs chopped off...

1256
00:56:23,012 --> 00:56:24,274
'cause I do a guy a favor.

1257
00:56:24,313 --> 00:56:26,178
Come on, let's go. Who is it?

1258
00:56:26,215 --> 00:56:27,341
All right,
you want to know who it is?

1259
00:56:27,383 --> 00:56:30,181
Should I tell you who it is?
Should I say?

1260
00:56:30,219 --> 00:56:32,779
It's Barney Dunn.

1261
00:56:32,821 --> 00:56:34,288
Who's Barney Dunn?

1262
00:56:34,323 --> 00:56:37,315
- Come on, who is it?
- Danny, you rat!

1263
00:56:37,359 --> 00:56:40,385
Listen, I don't owe you
anything over this.

1264
00:56:40,429 --> 00:56:44,126
Fellas, I swear on my life,
it's Barney Dunn.

1265
00:56:44,166 --> 00:56:47,363
And... and Barney,
may God forgive me.

1266
00:56:47,403 --> 00:56:49,064
- Who?
- Barney Dunn.

1267
00:56:49,104 --> 00:56:51,937
- I remember Barney Dunn.
- You know Barney Dunn.

1268
00:56:51,974 --> 00:56:53,703
I can't hear you.

1269
00:56:53,742 --> 00:56:57,508
Barney Dunn was the world's
worst ventriloquist.

1270
00:56:57,546 --> 00:56:59,207
If they couldn't get
an animal act...

1271
00:56:59,248 --> 00:57:00,442
they would call Barney Dunn.

1272
00:57:00,482 --> 00:57:03,417
Barney would work
children's parties.

1273
00:57:03,452 --> 00:57:05,977
Five-year-old kids
would boo him.

1274
00:57:06,021 --> 00:57:08,717
Two weeks ago, Danny,
who doesn't handle Barney...

1275
00:57:08,757 --> 00:57:10,782
That'll tell you something
about Barney's act.

1276
00:57:10,826 --> 00:57:12,384
Danny didn't want to handle him.

1277
00:57:12,428 --> 00:57:13,827
Danny meets Barney
on the street.

1278
00:57:13,862 --> 00:57:17,025
- Hey, how are you doing, Barney?
- Hi there, Danny.

1279
00:57:17,066 --> 00:57:19,159
I'm leaving on a c-c-cruise
tomorrow.

1280
00:57:19,201 --> 00:57:20,463
Oh, you're kidding. Where for?

1281
00:57:20,502 --> 00:57:22,834
I'm working this ship
to the Bahamas.

1282
00:57:22,871 --> 00:57:25,237
Oh, fantastic! Then back here?

1283
00:57:25,274 --> 00:57:27,708
No, and here's
the b-b-beauty part...

1284
00:57:27,743 --> 00:57:31,235
from the Bahamas
to Puerto Rico for three weeks.

1285
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:32,645
Oh, fantastic.
Who's your friend?

1286
00:57:32,681 --> 00:57:35,445
- So Danny names Barney Dunn.
- But can't they check that?

1287
00:57:35,484 --> 00:57:36,712
They do check it.

1288
00:57:36,752 --> 00:57:40,119
They tie up Danny and Tina,
and they go to check it.

1289
00:57:41,090 --> 00:57:43,820
What am I doing here?
How did I get into this?

1290
00:57:43,859 --> 00:57:48,455
Why me? What did I do to
deserve this that I'm here now?

1291
00:57:48,497 --> 00:57:49,623
You were really
quick on your feet...

1292
00:57:49,665 --> 00:57:51,189
to come up with that name
so fast.

1293
00:57:51,233 --> 00:57:52,700
Oh, great. That's wonderful.

1294
00:57:52,735 --> 00:57:55,829
Let me tell you something,
darling. I was traumatized.

1295
00:57:55,871 --> 00:57:59,272
My body went into shock
when they stuck that gun on you.

1296
00:57:59,308 --> 00:58:00,866
All I thought was,
they're going to kill us.

1297
00:58:00,909 --> 00:58:02,206
I'm going to be dead...

1298
00:58:02,244 --> 00:58:05,111
and Milton is coming
to the Waldorf soon.

1299
00:58:05,147 --> 00:58:07,479
Listen, Danny, they're going
to be back in a minute.

1300
00:58:07,516 --> 00:58:09,848
- We got to do something.
- What? I can't move a finger.

1301
00:58:09,885 --> 00:58:11,853
I'm tied up here like a pig.

1302
00:58:11,887 --> 00:58:13,252
If we could just
get out of these ropes.

1303
00:58:13,288 --> 00:58:15,620
- I can't.
- There's one guy out there.

1304
00:58:15,658 --> 00:58:17,125
There's two of us against him.

1305
00:58:17,159 --> 00:58:18,922
Yeah, but let me remind you...
he's got an ax.

1306
00:58:18,961 --> 00:58:21,020
The man has an ax.
So there's two of us.

1307
00:58:21,063 --> 00:58:23,327
- There'll be four of us.
- Maybe we could sneak away.

1308
00:58:23,365 --> 00:58:26,801
No. You know
what I'm thinking, though?

1309
00:58:26,835 --> 00:58:29,030
I used to handle...

1310
00:58:29,071 --> 00:58:32,404
I used to handle an escape
artist named Shandar...

1311
00:58:32,441 --> 00:58:34,841
who could get out of ropes.

1312
00:58:34,877 --> 00:58:39,678
But the problem is,
you got to be standing up to...

1313
00:58:39,715 --> 00:58:42,206
Even then,
I'm not sure we could do it.

1314
00:58:43,452 --> 00:58:45,682
Let me ask you something.
Do you think it's possible...

1315
00:58:45,721 --> 00:58:48,315
that we could work our way
off this table?

1316
00:58:48,357 --> 00:58:50,985
I can hardly move.

1317
00:58:51,026 --> 00:58:53,392
Try with me. I'm serious.

1318
00:58:53,429 --> 00:58:55,989
Try a little bit.
Come on, give it a try.

1319
00:58:56,031 --> 00:58:58,056
- You're so heavy.
- All right, just try.

1320
00:58:58,100 --> 00:58:59,692
Just do what I'm telling you.

1321
00:58:59,735 --> 00:59:01,362
Come on. Come on! It'll happen.

1322
00:59:01,403 --> 00:59:03,564
Move. Move. OK?

1323
00:59:03,605 --> 00:59:04,731
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1324
00:59:04,773 --> 00:59:06,172
Come on. Try and pull.
That's it.

1325
00:59:06,208 --> 00:59:08,904
See? It's not so tough.
Very good.

1326
00:59:08,944 --> 00:59:11,412
That's it. Try and slide down.

1327
00:59:11,447 --> 00:59:13,540
That's it. That's it. Very good.

1328
00:59:13,582 --> 00:59:15,709
Slowly. That's it, slowly.

1329
00:59:15,751 --> 00:59:18,151
That's it. Come on. Now pull.

1330
00:59:18,187 --> 00:59:20,985
Come on. Hard.
That's it. That's it.

1331
00:59:21,023 --> 00:59:23,082
A little more.
I think we've got it.

1332
00:59:23,125 --> 00:59:26,754
That a girl! That's right. OK.

1333
00:59:26,795 --> 00:59:28,626
- You got it?
- Yeah.

1334
00:59:28,664 --> 00:59:32,191
All right, all right.
Very good. Now...

1335
00:59:32,234 --> 00:59:35,226
I'm out of breath. All right
now, here's what Shandar...

1336
00:59:35,270 --> 00:59:36,794
When Shandar was like this...

1337
00:59:36,839 --> 00:59:39,603
what he would do is,
he would wriggle.

1338
00:59:39,641 --> 00:59:41,404
- Wriggle?
- Yeah. He would wriggle...

1339
00:59:41,443 --> 00:59:44,503
and what happens is,
the ropes gradually...

1340
00:59:44,546 --> 00:59:46,980
start to get some play in them,
they start to get loose.

1341
00:59:47,015 --> 00:59:48,778
Take my word for it.
He would wriggle. Yeah.

1342
00:59:48,817 --> 00:59:51,786
- You sure?
- Yeah, so... You ready?

1343
00:59:51,820 --> 00:59:54,653
Ready? All right now.
Now start to wriggle.

1344
00:59:54,690 --> 00:59:56,282
That's right. Wriggle.

1345
00:59:56,325 --> 00:59:58,190
See what I mean? That's a girl.

1346
00:59:58,227 --> 01:00:00,354
Just wriggle. That's it.

1347
01:00:00,395 --> 01:00:02,022
I'm wriggling.

1348
01:00:02,064 --> 01:00:04,032
Keep wriggling.
That's very important.

1349
01:00:04,066 --> 01:00:05,829
- You wriggling?
- Uh-huh.

1350
01:00:05,868 --> 01:00:08,860
That's... that's good wriggling.

1351
01:00:08,904 --> 01:00:11,372
- I don't want to over-wriggle.
- No, but it's nice wriggling.

1352
01:00:11,406 --> 01:00:14,068
That's it. The ropes
are starting to get loose.

1353
01:00:14,109 --> 01:00:16,873
Come on, it's happening.

1354
01:00:16,912 --> 01:00:18,209
My hand's getting free.

1355
01:00:18,247 --> 01:00:20,272
Keep wriggling. Don't stop now.

1356
01:00:20,315 --> 01:00:22,146
Ooh! I got it! I got it!

1357
01:00:22,184 --> 01:00:23,378
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Hold on!

1358
01:00:23,418 --> 01:00:24,783
I got it! I got it!

1359
01:00:24,820 --> 01:00:27,983
Yes? Oh, great!

1360
01:00:28,023 --> 01:00:30,355
Come on. Get this thing off.
Come on, keep wriggling.

1361
01:00:30,392 --> 01:00:33,054
Keep wriggling, darling.
Don't...

1362
01:00:33,095 --> 01:00:34,255
- Oh, great!
- I told you.

1363
01:00:34,296 --> 01:00:36,196
That's what Shandar did.
He would wriggle...

1364
01:00:36,231 --> 01:00:38,893
and then you get
the whole thing to happen.

1365
01:00:38,934 --> 01:00:40,492
I saw it a million times.

1366
01:01:04,326 --> 01:01:06,226
Hey, hey, hold it!

1367
01:01:30,919 --> 01:01:33,854
Let's go.
Where the hell are we?

1368
01:01:33,889 --> 01:01:35,015
What is this?

1369
01:01:35,057 --> 01:01:37,218
This looks like some kind
of a factory or something.

1370
01:01:37,259 --> 01:01:39,819
Looks like a warehouse.

1371
01:01:39,862 --> 01:01:42,296
You hear him?
I think he's right behind us.

1372
01:01:42,331 --> 01:01:43,491
Let's get out of here.

1373
01:01:43,532 --> 01:01:46,660
- It's so dark.
- All right. Don't panic.

1374
01:01:46,702 --> 01:01:49,000
Looks like a lot
of parade floats and stuff.

1375
01:01:49,037 --> 01:01:51,335
Perfect. There's a guy with
a pistol running after us...

1376
01:01:51,373 --> 01:01:55,207
we're stuck in the middle
of the Macy's Day Parade.

1377
01:01:55,244 --> 01:01:58,441
What's going on here?
Where the hell are we?

1378
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:00,175
Jesus!

1379
01:02:11,560 --> 01:02:13,858
Don't move, or I'll blow
your goddamn brains out!

1380
01:02:13,896 --> 01:02:16,296
Don't shoot!
I'm just the beard, really.

1381
01:02:16,331 --> 01:02:18,424
You're making a mistake.
He's just the beard!

1382
01:02:18,467 --> 01:02:22,130
Don't tell me you're the beard,
you goddamn little rat, you.

1383
01:02:22,170 --> 01:02:24,229
Run, Tina, run!
He's out of bullets!

1384
01:02:24,273 --> 01:02:27,208
This is our chance!
He's out of bullets!

1385
01:02:27,242 --> 01:02:29,870
All right, all right.
I'm coming!

1386
01:02:33,215 --> 01:02:35,240
You little rat. You're never
going to get out of here.

1387
01:02:35,284 --> 01:02:36,717
I'll find you.

1388
01:03:30,305 --> 01:03:32,068
I don't believe this!
He's drunk!

1389
01:03:32,107 --> 01:03:33,267
I got a show in a half hour!

1390
01:03:33,308 --> 01:03:35,640
I got a packed house, Danny!
He's drunk!

1391
01:03:35,677 --> 01:03:39,078
Don't panic. I'll deal with him.

1392
01:03:39,114 --> 01:03:40,672
Relax, will you?
I can talk to him.

1393
01:03:40,716 --> 01:03:42,650
Lou. Lou. Is Milton here yet?

1394
01:03:42,684 --> 01:03:44,151
Yes.
He came with Howard Cosell.

1395
01:03:44,186 --> 01:03:47,246
Jesus.
All right, relax, everybody.

1396
01:03:47,289 --> 01:03:49,154
This is Lou's wife Teresa.

1397
01:03:49,191 --> 01:03:51,523
That's Tina Musante.

1398
01:03:51,560 --> 01:03:53,460
- Vitale.
- Danny, we got to do something.

1399
01:03:53,495 --> 01:03:55,486
He's got to go on in 20 minutes.
I got a full house out there.

1400
01:03:55,530 --> 01:03:58,294
- OK. Lou. Lou.
- Something's gotta happen.

1401
01:03:58,333 --> 01:03:59,994
Say the three S's, Lou.
Lou, please.

1402
01:04:00,035 --> 01:04:02,526
You got to pull yourself
together.

1403
01:04:02,571 --> 01:04:05,039
Listen to me.
You're gonna do a great show.

1404
01:04:05,073 --> 01:04:06,199
Is he going to be OK?

1405
01:04:06,241 --> 01:04:08,334
Danny will get him sober.
He's done it before.

1406
01:04:08,377 --> 01:04:11,437
Come on, Lou. I need two
aspirin, some tomato juice...

1407
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:13,675
and some worcestershire sauce...

1408
01:04:13,715 --> 01:04:16,309
and some goat cheese
and some chicken fat.

1409
01:04:16,351 --> 01:04:18,683
- That's gonna do it?
- That's the Danny Rose formula.

1410
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:20,085
I still can't figure out
how it works.

1411
01:04:20,122 --> 01:04:24,559
I promise you're going to be OK
tonight, my hand to God.

1412
01:04:24,593 --> 01:04:30,793
One day, you will hold,
my cara mia

1413
01:04:30,832 --> 01:04:37,203
A child of your own, and I pray

1414
01:04:37,239 --> 01:04:43,644
Bambina, remember the story

1415
01:04:43,678 --> 01:04:48,911
Your mama, my mama would say

1416
01:04:48,950 --> 01:04:53,478
Keep Italian in your heart

1417
01:04:53,522 --> 01:04:56,514
Let it always be a part

1418
01:04:56,558 --> 01:05:01,757
Of you

1419
01:05:02,898 --> 01:05:06,231
Never let it fade away

1420
01:05:06,268 --> 01:05:09,328
Be a part of every day

1421
01:05:09,371 --> 01:05:15,367
Let it stay in your heart
forever

1422
01:05:15,410 --> 01:05:18,937
Keep Italian in your heart

1423
01:05:18,980 --> 01:05:22,245
Let it always be a part

1424
01:05:22,284 --> 01:05:25,947
Of you

1425
01:05:28,590 --> 01:05:31,718
Never let it fade away

1426
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:34,854
Be a part of every day

1427
01:05:34,896 --> 01:05:40,801
Let it stay in your heart
forever

1428
01:05:40,836 --> 01:05:44,328
My bambina

1429
01:05:44,372 --> 01:05:47,466
My cara mia

1430
01:05:47,509 --> 01:05:52,640
My bambina

1431
01:05:54,149 --> 01:05:55,673
Thank you. Thank you.

1432
01:05:55,717 --> 01:05:57,241
Thank you. Love ya.

1433
01:05:57,285 --> 01:05:59,378
This is what you get
when you eat too much.

1434
01:05:59,421 --> 01:06:01,651
Una two.

1435
01:06:01,690 --> 01:06:04,181
Agita

1436
01:06:04,226 --> 01:06:06,820
My gumba in the banzone

1437
01:06:06,862 --> 01:06:08,762
When I eat, he gets a treat

1438
01:06:08,797 --> 01:06:10,526
Like a canzone

1439
01:06:10,565 --> 01:06:12,590
He enjoys every meal

1440
01:06:12,634 --> 01:06:14,363
Every bite that I steal

1441
01:06:14,402 --> 01:06:18,065
Agita, my gumba in the banzone

1442
01:06:22,010 --> 01:06:25,605
Some people like-a their pizza,
some people like-a suffrite

1443
01:06:25,647 --> 01:06:29,242
And others like hot pepper
on everything they eat

1444
01:06:29,284 --> 01:06:33,050
You hunger with a vuole
to taste some baccala

1445
01:06:33,088 --> 01:06:36,785
Then all at once you think,
"Will I answer to gumba?"

1446
01:06:40,662 --> 01:06:44,189
My lovely, lovely woman,
I hate to see her cry

1447
01:06:44,232 --> 01:06:47,690
But when I start to mangia,
I get the evil eye

1448
01:06:47,736 --> 01:06:49,761
My vuole's getting stronger

1449
01:06:49,804 --> 01:06:51,863
Ah, the hell with my gumba

1450
01:06:51,907 --> 01:06:54,375
Lou,
you were wonderfully superb.

1451
01:06:54,409 --> 01:06:56,172
- Chicago is my favorite.
- I know my fans.

1452
01:06:56,211 --> 01:06:59,237
- You were terrific.
- You were worried.

1453
01:06:59,281 --> 01:07:01,545
I wasn't worried at all.
You were fabulous.

1454
01:07:01,583 --> 01:07:04,051
Thank you for coming.
I don't forget my friends.

1455
01:07:04,085 --> 01:07:06,451
George,
you don't miss an act, huh?

1456
01:07:06,488 --> 01:07:09,013
How you doing, hon?
You holding up all right?

1457
01:07:09,057 --> 01:07:10,319
Phil and Diane are
going to give me a lift home.

1458
01:07:10,358 --> 01:07:11,655
I'm so tired.

1459
01:07:11,693 --> 01:07:13,092
And I have to take care
of the sitter, too.

1460
01:07:13,128 --> 01:07:14,288
I appreciate it...

1461
01:07:14,329 --> 01:07:16,092
because I got to do some
serious things with Danny.

1462
01:07:16,131 --> 01:07:18,395
I got to talk to him.
Milton, the cigar man, you know?

1463
01:07:18,433 --> 01:07:19,593
I'll be home
in about two, three hours.

1464
01:07:19,634 --> 01:07:21,397
OK, Danny,
make sure he gets home early.

1465
01:07:21,436 --> 01:07:23,233
- Thanks for coming!
- Hey, Lou!

1466
01:07:23,271 --> 01:07:25,432
Benny. All right!

1467
01:07:27,142 --> 01:07:29,440
Have I got a story for you.
Lou, when I tell you...

1468
01:07:29,477 --> 01:07:31,707
what this woman and I
have been through today...

1469
01:07:31,746 --> 01:07:34,579
really, when you find out
what you put me through today...

1470
01:07:34,616 --> 01:07:35,742
unbelievable.

1471
01:07:35,784 --> 01:07:37,445
Danny, I got to speak to you,
and I got to do it now...

1472
01:07:37,485 --> 01:07:39,817
while I'm still a little high.

1473
01:07:39,854 --> 01:07:42,721
Lou, I can't sleep home
tonight, OK?

1474
01:07:42,757 --> 01:07:44,054
I got to get this off my chest.

1475
01:07:44,092 --> 01:07:46,686
It's only right that Tina be
here, because she's part of it.

1476
01:07:46,728 --> 01:07:48,719
What?

1477
01:07:48,763 --> 01:07:51,357
Well, come next week, I feel
some changes gotta be made.

1478
01:07:51,399 --> 01:07:52,991
Yeah? Like what?

1479
01:07:53,034 --> 01:07:56,026
Like, Tina and I, you know,
we're crazy about each other...

1480
01:07:56,071 --> 01:07:58,562
and I feel I got to say
something to Terry about it.

1481
01:07:58,607 --> 01:08:00,700
Well, you know, if that's what
you guys decide on...

1482
01:08:00,742 --> 01:08:02,107
that's what you wanna do,
you know...

1483
01:08:02,143 --> 01:08:03,269
you got to do
what you got to do.

1484
01:08:03,311 --> 01:08:05,404
I just hope that
you know what you're doing.

1485
01:08:05,447 --> 01:08:06,971
We're sure about a lotta things.

1486
01:08:07,015 --> 01:08:08,175
Tina and I have been doin'
a lot of discussing.

1487
01:08:08,216 --> 01:08:10,878
I feel for myself that
I got to make a few changes.

1488
01:08:10,919 --> 01:08:13,752
- Like what kind of changes?
- Like management.

1489
01:08:15,390 --> 01:08:20,487
What do you mean, management?
What do you mean, management?

1490
01:08:20,528 --> 01:08:22,462
Tina's really close
to Sid Bacharach.

1491
01:08:22,497 --> 01:08:24,795
You had to notice him there
tonight.

1492
01:08:24,833 --> 01:08:26,425
He was there to see me.

1493
01:08:29,271 --> 01:08:33,640
I don't understand. What do...
You want to change management?

1494
01:08:34,776 --> 01:08:36,175
Don't think
it's not hard for me to say...

1495
01:08:36,211 --> 01:08:38,611
but I got to do
what's right for my career.

1496
01:08:41,650 --> 01:08:43,447
What do you mean? Am I hear...

1497
01:08:43,485 --> 01:08:45,476
I can't believe
you're saying this.

1498
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:48,421
Danny, Sid can really move me.

1499
01:08:48,456 --> 01:08:50,947
I mean,
we've got this special rapport.

1500
01:08:52,794 --> 01:08:54,284
How do you know Sid?

1501
01:08:54,329 --> 01:08:57,696
Have you been pushing him
to leave me?

1502
01:08:57,732 --> 01:08:59,131
Hey, leave me out of this.

1503
01:08:59,167 --> 01:09:02,193
All I know is he's a big talent,
and he's playing joints.

1504
01:09:02,237 --> 01:09:05,206
Joints? What do you mean?
He was lucky he could get...

1505
01:09:05,240 --> 01:09:09,040
When I met him, he was still
singing Finiculi, Finicula.

1506
01:09:09,077 --> 01:09:11,045
Look, Danny, facts are facts.

1507
01:09:11,079 --> 01:09:13,070
What are you talking about,
facts are facts?

1508
01:09:13,114 --> 01:09:14,775
You know,
this kid owes me his life.

1509
01:09:14,816 --> 01:09:17,216
Will you leave her out of this?
What's done is done.

1510
01:09:17,252 --> 01:09:20,153
I don't understand you. We've
been through so much together.

1511
01:09:20,188 --> 01:09:22,986
You make everything
into a personal situation.

1512
01:09:23,024 --> 01:09:25,254
Of course I make it personal.

1513
01:09:25,293 --> 01:09:27,261
That's the point.
That's our relationship.

1514
01:09:27,295 --> 01:09:29,889
You can't put into a contract
what I do with you.

1515
01:09:29,931 --> 01:09:31,558
Look, all right,
can I give you...

1516
01:09:31,599 --> 01:09:33,726
May I give you... my Uncle Meir...

1517
01:09:33,768 --> 01:09:35,429
Say something, will you?

1518
01:09:35,470 --> 01:09:36,903
This is business
between the two of you.

1519
01:09:36,938 --> 01:09:38,166
You got to do
what you got to do...

1520
01:09:38,206 --> 01:09:39,901
and Danny's gotta understand it.
He's a big boy.

1521
01:09:39,941 --> 01:09:42,000
What are you talking about?

1522
01:09:42,043 --> 01:09:44,534
If anything comes out of this,
you'll be in for a taste.

1523
01:09:45,947 --> 01:09:47,847
Danny, where are you going?
Danny?

1524
01:09:58,259 --> 01:10:01,854
Hey, how you doing, Danny?
You hear about Barney Dunn?

1525
01:10:01,896 --> 01:10:03,625
A couple of guys
done a pretty good job on him.

1526
01:10:03,665 --> 01:10:05,826
They beat him up pretty badly.

1527
01:10:09,037 --> 01:10:11,096
I thought he was on a cruise.

1528
01:10:11,139 --> 01:10:14,666
Nah, nah. That was canceled.
He's in the hospital now.

1529
01:10:14,709 --> 01:10:17,803
It was pretty rough for a while.
It was touch and go.

1530
01:10:17,846 --> 01:10:20,713
But it's all right now.
The cops got 'em.

1531
01:10:20,749 --> 01:10:22,910
They got the guys
that done the job on him.

1532
01:10:24,886 --> 01:10:27,480
- Which hospital?
- Roosevelt.

1533
01:11:01,289 --> 01:11:02,813
How you doing, Barney?

1534
01:11:06,928 --> 01:11:09,123
W-w-what are you doing here?

1535
01:11:09,164 --> 01:11:14,864
Well, I heard
that you got beat up, so...

1536
01:11:14,903 --> 01:11:17,337
I s-s-still don't know
what happened.

1537
01:11:18,773 --> 01:11:20,968
I want you to know,
if there's anything I can do...

1538
01:11:21,009 --> 01:11:23,409
anything at all,
you know what I mean?

1539
01:11:23,445 --> 01:11:26,039
Hospital bills, anything
at all... I'll take care of it.

1540
01:11:26,080 --> 01:11:28,913
You want to pay
my hospital bills?

1541
01:11:28,950 --> 01:11:31,441
Danny, are you sure you're OK?

1542
01:11:31,486 --> 01:11:34,387
Really, Barney, anything at all.
Whatever you need.

1543
01:11:53,575 --> 01:11:56,442
I thought this was
a funny story. It's terrible!

1544
01:11:56,478 --> 01:11:59,072
So what do you want me to do?
It's not my life.

1545
01:11:59,113 --> 01:12:02,480
So Lou leaves his wife and kids,
and he moves in with Tina.

1546
01:12:02,517 --> 01:12:05,247
Sid Bacharach's handling him.
He's doing all right.

1547
01:12:05,286 --> 01:12:10,019
You may possess the world
and all of its gold

1548
01:12:10,058 --> 01:12:12,356
Oh, gold won't bring you

1549
01:12:12,393 --> 01:12:14,122
Happiness

1550
01:12:14,162 --> 01:12:17,029
When you're growing old

1551
01:12:17,065 --> 01:12:18,999
Oh, the world

1552
01:12:19,033 --> 01:12:20,591
It's still the same...

1553
01:12:20,635 --> 01:12:22,603
You OK?
You seem a little down.

1554
01:12:22,637 --> 01:12:24,605
No. I have a headache.

1555
01:12:25,974 --> 01:12:28,670
What are you giving me?
I ordered a courvoisier.

1556
01:12:28,710 --> 01:12:31,201
Gee, I'm awfully sorry.
Didn't you order a Jack Daniels?

1557
01:12:31,246 --> 01:12:33,146
I know what I ordered.
I ordered a courvoisier.

1558
01:12:33,181 --> 01:12:34,910
You did say courvoisier.

1559
01:12:34,949 --> 01:12:37,440
Let's not make a federal case
out of it.

1560
01:12:37,485 --> 01:12:38,816
Loves you

1561
01:12:38,853 --> 01:12:41,583
Go find yourself that body...

1562
01:12:41,623 --> 01:12:44,615
Honey, what are you doing up?

1563
01:12:44,659 --> 01:12:47,389
I can't sleep.

1564
01:12:47,428 --> 01:12:49,089
You know,
it's 4:00 in the morning.

1565
01:12:49,130 --> 01:12:51,564
Yeah, I know.
I had a bad dream.

1566
01:12:51,599 --> 01:12:52,930
What is this,
like a thing or something?

1567
01:12:52,967 --> 01:12:55,197
I mean, This is goin' on
every other night.

1568
01:12:55,236 --> 01:12:56,965
Why don't you take a pill
or something?

1569
01:12:57,005 --> 01:12:58,870
No, no. I don't like pills.

1570
01:12:58,907 --> 01:13:01,239
When I can't sleep,
I take one of those Seconals.

1571
01:13:01,276 --> 01:13:03,801
- I got out like a baby.
- I'm OK. I'm fine.

1572
01:13:03,845 --> 01:13:07,679
Listen, I got a great new idea.
When I go to Atlantic City...

1573
01:13:07,715 --> 01:13:11,344
I'll open with "You're Nobody
Till Somebody Loves You"...

1574
01:13:11,386 --> 01:13:13,411
then I'm going to go right into
"When You're Smiling."

1575
01:13:13,454 --> 01:13:15,786
Lou, will you give me a break?
It's 4:00 in the morning.

1576
01:13:15,823 --> 01:13:19,520
You're not listening to me.
This is important stuff.

1577
01:13:19,561 --> 01:13:22,530
Angelina, I can't sleep.

1578
01:13:22,564 --> 01:13:25,499
L... I feel jumpy.

1579
01:13:25,533 --> 01:13:28,400
I don't know. I'm not myself.

1580
01:13:29,470 --> 01:13:32,837
I see bad dreams...

1581
01:13:32,874 --> 01:13:34,967
deep dreams...

1582
01:13:35,009 --> 01:13:37,569
bad conscience.

1583
01:13:37,612 --> 01:13:39,978
A little while ago,
I met some man.

1584
01:13:40,014 --> 01:13:42,949
I hardly spent any time
with him.

1585
01:13:42,984 --> 01:13:46,283
One day, we had an adventure.

1586
01:13:46,321 --> 01:13:50,052
Yes. He makes you feel uneasy.

1587
01:13:50,091 --> 01:13:53,652
I did him some little wrong,
you know?

1588
01:13:53,695 --> 01:13:55,356
Just some small business matter.

1589
01:13:55,396 --> 01:13:57,830
I didn't even know him
very well.

1590
01:13:57,865 --> 01:14:01,266
Then, you know, when I had
the chance to say something...

1591
01:14:01,302 --> 01:14:04,499
I didn't speak up.

1592
01:14:04,539 --> 01:14:07,633
I have a vision of you...

1593
01:14:07,675 --> 01:14:10,473
standing before a large mirror.

1594
01:14:10,511 --> 01:14:13,912
I had that dream last week.

1595
01:14:13,948 --> 01:14:16,178
That was it...
exactly my dream.

1596
01:14:16,217 --> 01:14:18,208
What is it you're seeking there?

1597
01:14:18,252 --> 01:14:21,153
I don't know.

1598
01:14:21,189 --> 01:14:23,817
I want to rest easy again.

1599
01:14:23,858 --> 01:14:25,723
I want to find myself.

1600
01:14:27,061 --> 01:14:30,462
I want to wipe out my thoughts
and forget this guy.

1601
01:14:30,498 --> 01:14:32,659
I can't see clearly.

1602
01:14:32,700 --> 01:14:35,669
It's unclear.

1603
01:14:35,703 --> 01:14:37,068
It's all unclear.

1604
01:14:42,343 --> 01:14:43,833
What's the matter with you
lately?

1605
01:14:43,878 --> 01:14:45,641
I mean, you're always so edgy.

1606
01:14:45,680 --> 01:14:47,739
I don't want to go
to California, OK?

1607
01:14:47,782 --> 01:14:49,147
It gives me the creeps
out there.

1608
01:14:49,183 --> 01:14:51,151
It's important
you go to California.

1609
01:14:51,185 --> 01:14:53,983
Well, then you go.

1610
01:14:54,022 --> 01:14:56,422
I mean, what is it with you?
I mean lately.

1611
01:14:56,457 --> 01:14:57,685
Everything's going so nicely.

1612
01:14:57,725 --> 01:14:59,750
My comeback's
in full swing now...

1613
01:14:59,794 --> 01:15:02,092
but, no,
you weren't happy in Vegas.

1614
01:15:02,130 --> 01:15:03,654
You weren't happy
in Atlantic City.

1615
01:15:03,698 --> 01:15:06,223
You complain all the time.
I thought you'd be happy.

1616
01:15:06,267 --> 01:15:09,202
I'm moody. You knew I was moody
when you met me.

1617
01:15:09,237 --> 01:15:10,363
I've had it with the moods.

1618
01:15:10,405 --> 01:15:13,704
I mean, I gotta go
to California. That's it.

1619
01:15:13,741 --> 01:15:15,265
Now what's the matter?

1620
01:15:17,645 --> 01:15:19,203
I don't know.

1621
01:15:22,483 --> 01:15:26,214
Lou moves to L.A. Tina doesn't.

1622
01:15:26,254 --> 01:15:27,949
It's all over between them.

1623
01:15:27,989 --> 01:15:29,752
- Guess who calls her for a date?
- I have no idea.

1624
01:15:29,791 --> 01:15:32,123
Remember the shaving-cream man
from outer space?

1625
01:15:32,160 --> 01:15:34,151
The guy she met with Danny when
they were lost in the reeds?

1626
01:15:34,195 --> 01:15:36,663
That's right.
Well, they start going out...

1627
01:15:36,698 --> 01:15:37,960
but she's just as moody
with him.

1628
01:15:37,999 --> 01:15:40,194
- Naturally.
- They fight. They argue.

1629
01:15:40,234 --> 01:15:42,566
Then one morning,
Thanksgiving morning...

1630
01:15:42,603 --> 01:15:44,537
the two of them
are on Central Park West.

1631
01:15:44,572 --> 01:15:46,335
There's the parade.

1632
01:16:42,163 --> 01:16:44,222
- Now what's wrong?
- I don't know.

1633
01:16:44,265 --> 01:16:46,733
Jesus, Tina,
what's wrong with you?

1634
01:16:46,768 --> 01:16:49,168
Look, maybe we should have
a little heart to heart.

1635
01:16:49,203 --> 01:16:51,603
Everything makes you cry.

1636
01:16:51,639 --> 01:16:53,334
Maybe you should see a doctor.
I don't know what to do.

1637
01:16:53,374 --> 01:16:55,342
- Excuse me.
- Baby...

1638
01:16:55,376 --> 01:16:57,276
Tina, what are you
trying to pull here?

1639
01:16:57,311 --> 01:17:00,337
I gotta see Angelina right away.

1640
01:17:00,381 --> 01:17:02,474
I'm sorry. Angelina's not here.

1641
01:17:02,517 --> 01:17:05,077
What time is she coming back?
I need her advice.

1642
01:17:05,119 --> 01:17:07,781
Angelina's having Thanksgiving
with her grandchildren...

1643
01:17:07,822 --> 01:17:09,153
and she won't be here
until Monday.

1644
01:17:09,190 --> 01:17:10,384
This is important.

1645
01:17:10,424 --> 01:17:12,654
Well, I can't help it
if it's important.

1646
01:17:12,693 --> 01:17:15,924
She won't be here until Monday.
Please come Monday.

1647
01:17:32,780 --> 01:17:35,442
Hey, I got the frozen turkeys.

1648
01:17:35,483 --> 01:17:37,451
I can smell it.

1649
01:17:37,485 --> 01:17:38,918
- Here you go.
- Thank you, Danny.

1650
01:17:38,953 --> 01:17:40,477
Give me a little room there.

1651
01:17:40,521 --> 01:17:42,182
God love you.

1652
01:17:42,223 --> 01:17:43,884
- Here's your frozen turkey.
- Thank you, Danny.

1653
01:17:43,925 --> 01:17:48,259
Believe me, the frozen
is just as g-g-good as real.

1654
01:17:48,296 --> 01:17:49,695
- Got it?
- Uh-huh.

1655
01:17:49,730 --> 01:17:52,221
And the frozens are much cheaper
than the real ones.

1656
01:17:52,266 --> 01:17:53,392
Can I help?

1657
01:17:53,434 --> 01:17:54,867
No, sit there. You'll fall over.

1658
01:17:54,902 --> 01:17:56,426
It really smells terrific.

1659
01:17:56,470 --> 01:18:01,567
Just dig in. Dig in.
Don't hesitate.

1660
01:18:01,609 --> 01:18:02,735
Would you like a drink
or something?

1661
01:18:02,777 --> 01:18:05,211
- Oh, I'd love it.
- Yeah?

1662
01:18:05,246 --> 01:18:09,945
There's some tab over there,
and there's some club soda.

1663
01:18:09,984 --> 01:18:11,417
Excuse me one second.

1664
01:18:13,054 --> 01:18:15,113
Yeah, sure. That's right.

1665
01:18:15,156 --> 01:18:17,852
It's the twins! It's the twins!

1666
01:18:17,892 --> 01:18:21,191
Yes, yes.
Sure. Sure, darling, sure.

1667
01:18:21,229 --> 01:18:23,697
Yes. The new noses are good?

1668
01:18:23,731 --> 01:18:26,063
Yes. Sure.

1669
01:18:32,573 --> 01:18:35,872
L... I came to apologize.

1670
01:18:40,514 --> 01:18:43,312
Are you going to ask me in?

1671
01:18:43,351 --> 01:18:45,842
Let me call you back. Yeah.

1672
01:18:45,887 --> 01:18:48,549
No, I'll get back to you.
Let me... I'll call you back.

1673
01:18:52,360 --> 01:18:53,793
I hope I'm not intruding.

1674
01:18:59,700 --> 01:19:01,691
I realize you hate me.

1675
01:19:01,736 --> 01:19:03,931
Danny, bring her in, will you?
The food's gettin' cold.

1676
01:19:03,971 --> 01:19:06,496
Danny,
who is your fr-fr-fr... guest?

1677
01:19:06,540 --> 01:19:10,271
Oh, it's nobody. It's nothing.

1678
01:19:12,380 --> 01:19:14,814
Was it your Uncle Sidney
who said...

1679
01:19:14,849 --> 01:19:17,818
acceptance, forgiveness,
and love?

1680
01:19:17,852 --> 01:19:19,251
Look, I've had a bad year.

1681
01:19:19,287 --> 01:19:20,914
You know, if things
don't pick up for me...

1682
01:19:20,955 --> 01:19:24,288
I'm going to be selling
storm windows soon.

1683
01:19:26,527 --> 01:19:28,427
I'd like to be friends.

1684
01:19:29,630 --> 01:19:31,996
I don't think that would be
such a great idea.

1685
01:19:34,035 --> 01:19:36,663
This is the best Thanksgiving
party we've had so far.

1686
01:19:36,704 --> 01:19:38,865
Here's your napkin, honey.
You said you needed one.

1687
01:19:38,906 --> 01:19:41,670
This is absolutely
the best Thanksgiving party.

1688
01:19:41,709 --> 01:19:42,835
Danny, this is marvelous.

1689
01:19:42,877 --> 01:19:45,437
Hey, Danny,
wh is your fr-fr-fr... guest?

1690
01:19:45,479 --> 01:19:47,071
The cranberry sauce is dry.

1691
01:19:47,114 --> 01:19:49,048
You're eating
the mashed potatoes.

1692
01:19:50,952 --> 01:19:52,920
Hey, what a spread.

1693
01:19:54,488 --> 01:19:56,820
Wait a second. I'll be right in.

1694
01:19:56,857 --> 01:19:59,348
Hey, Danny,
thanks a lot for the invite.

1695
01:19:59,393 --> 01:20:02,157
Boy, Thanksgiving
sure rolls around fast.

1696
01:21:01,222 --> 01:21:03,884
Well, that's
my Danny Rose story.

1697
01:21:03,924 --> 01:21:07,690
- Unbelievable. Fantastic.
- The man is a living legend.

1698
01:21:07,728 --> 01:21:09,491
Do you know
that only six months ago...

1699
01:21:09,530 --> 01:21:10,963
they gave him
the single greatest honor...

1700
01:21:10,998 --> 01:21:12,966
you can get
in the Broadway area?

1701
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,434
Look at the menu.
At this very delicatessen...

1702
01:21:15,469 --> 01:21:17,266
they named a sandwich
after him...

1703
01:21:17,304 --> 01:21:19,738
the Danny Rose Special.

1704
01:21:19,774 --> 01:21:22,334
Probably a cream cheese
on a bagel with marinara sauce.

1705
01:21:22,376 --> 01:21:25,277
- Perfect.
- He deserves it.

1706
01:21:25,312 --> 01:21:26,973
Did you ever go to one
of his Thanksgiving parties?

1707
01:21:27,014 --> 01:21:28,811
- Once.
- Anybody go? Did you go?

1708
01:21:28,849 --> 01:21:32,478
Yeah, yeah. Where they have
the frozen turkey, right?

1709
01:21:32,520 --> 01:21:34,715
Economical,
but a lotta of laughs.

1710
01:21:34,755 --> 01:21:37,519
Cranberry sauce
made like a rock.

1711
01:21:37,558 --> 01:21:38,957
Oh, it was incredible.

1712
01:21:38,993 --> 01:21:42,485
Listen. Excuse me.
Before we go any further...

1713
01:21:42,530 --> 01:21:43,861
may I ask you a favor?

1714
01:21:43,898 --> 01:21:45,991
- Sir?
- Can we go home now?

1715
01:21:46,033 --> 01:21:48,866
- I'm tired.
- What are you talking about?

1716
01:21:48,903 --> 01:21:50,268
I haven't see you
in 110 years. Stay.

1717
01:21:50,304 --> 01:21:52,101
I have to go to Atlantic City
tomorrow.

1718
01:21:52,139 --> 01:21:53,663
I'll get the check.
I'll take care of it.

1719
01:21:53,707 --> 01:21:58,872
Really?
Oh, national holiday.

1720
01:21:58,913 --> 01:22:01,473
With these kind of laughs,
I figure it's worth it.

1721
01:22:01,515 --> 01:22:03,415
Well, we'll do it again
tomorrow.

1722
01:22:04,415 --> 01:22:14,415
