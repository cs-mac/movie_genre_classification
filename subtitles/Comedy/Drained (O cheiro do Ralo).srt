1
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:07,484
DRAINED

2
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,528
EVERYTHING LIFE HAS TO OFFER

3
00:02:17,937 --> 00:02:21,338
<i>Soran was an anagram,</i>
<i>that's what he told me</i>.

4
00:02:21,441 --> 00:02:24,377
I had to pay a lot
for this watch...

5
00:02:24,377 --> 00:02:26,504
it used to belong
to Prof. Soran.

6
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:29,639
- Sorun?
- Soran, it's an anagram.

7
00:02:29,716 --> 00:02:31,616
And does it really works?

8
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:35,749
And so, how much
will you give me for it.

9
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:38,653
The bad Smell comes
from the drain.

10
00:02:38,725 --> 00:02:39,953
<i>I was afraid</i>
<i>he might think that</i>...

11
00:02:40,059 --> 00:02:41,321
<i>the Smell was coming from me</i>.

12
00:02:41,394 --> 00:02:43,692
Prof. Soran was a genius...

13
00:02:44,697 --> 00:02:48,064
a sage, a visionary.

14
00:02:48,134 --> 00:02:51,763
Could I take a closer look...

15
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:54,534
at your wonderful watch
which belonged to Prof. Soril.

16
00:02:54,607 --> 00:02:55,767
- Soran.
- Sorun.

17
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:58,072
Soran, it's an anagram.

18
00:02:58,945 --> 00:03:01,470
You know how
I came by the watch?

19
00:03:01,915 --> 00:03:04,213
Through an archeologist.

20
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:06,650
I didn't think it was that old.

21
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,220
The archeologist's name,
I can't remember now...

22
00:03:09,322 --> 00:03:11,224
but he used to be a spy.

23
00:03:11,224 --> 00:03:13,021
<i>I knew I was about to hear</i>
<i>another one of those stories</i>...

24
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:14,460
<i>which I was in no mood for</i>.

25
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,451
Despite the inestimable value
of this watch...

26
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:19,465
I'm ready to offer it to you
for a very special price.

27
00:03:19,465 --> 00:03:21,831
Listen, I really don't want it...

28
00:03:21,901 --> 00:03:24,734
if it had a cover at least,
I'd buy it.

29
00:03:28,808 --> 00:03:29,968
I don't think you realize...

30
00:03:30,076 --> 00:03:32,476
the opportunity coming
your way here.

31
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,947
Luck opens its doors
to everyone...

32
00:03:37,016 --> 00:03:39,211
at least once in a lifetime.

33
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:43,447
But if the opportunity is lost...

34
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:47,985
luck closes its doors.

35
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:20,553
What's your name?

36
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:25,462
<i>I'd never in my life be able</i>
<i>to pronounce that name</i>.

37
00:04:25,531 --> 00:04:27,400
You work here long?

38
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,368
One week.

39
00:04:30,637 --> 00:04:32,798
What you reading?

40
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:35,534
James, what?

41
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:38,372
That's James. James Ellroy.

42
00:04:43,816 --> 00:04:46,046
What's wrong,
didn't like your sandwich?

43
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:48,087
No, it's just that
I'm not feeling too hot.

44
00:04:48,154 --> 00:04:50,213
I'd like something to drink.
A soft drink.

45
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,485
- Which one?
- Doesn't matter.

46
00:04:52,558 --> 00:04:54,150
OK.

47
00:04:56,829 --> 00:04:58,729
<i>I could spend a whole week...</i>

48
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:01,028
<i>just looking at that ass</i>.

49
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:04,763
Thank you.

50
00:05:11,277 --> 00:05:12,676
For you.

51
00:05:13,246 --> 00:05:18,912
Huh, raspberry drop, nice.

52
00:05:20,887 --> 00:05:22,718
What's your name again?

53
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:27,384
<i>I'd never in my life be able</i>
<i>to pronounce that name</i>.

54
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:30,327
<i>I wanted to ask her to turn</i>
<i>around, just once more</i>.

55
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:33,425
- Bye.
- Bye.

56
00:05:56,756 --> 00:05:58,553
It's silver.

57
00:06:13,005 --> 00:06:14,632
$30?

58
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:23,777
Life's not easy.

59
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:26,578
The Smell is coming
from the drain...

60
00:06:26,686 --> 00:06:28,244
have to fix the bathroom.

61
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:33,886
Aren't you going to
touch your strogonoff?

62
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,087
No, I'm not very hu...

63
00:06:36,929 --> 00:06:40,456
The invitations are
already at the printers.

64
00:06:45,371 --> 00:06:48,135
We're going to be real happy,
you'll see.

65
00:06:49,108 --> 00:06:51,099
You'll see.

66
00:06:52,545 --> 00:06:54,604
I think only a naive person...

67
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:59,711
practically a retard,
believes in happiness.

68
00:07:11,364 --> 00:07:13,798
Heartless,
that's what you are.

69
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:26,745
I'm sorry.

70
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:30,917
I'm sorry, I didn't want
to spoil this night...

71
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:33,010
it's just that I'm so nervous,
with only one month left...

72
00:07:33,085 --> 00:07:35,417
- I'm sorry.
- I don't want to get married.

73
00:07:37,423 --> 00:07:39,186
What?

74
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,788
You heard right,
I don't want to get married...

75
00:07:43,863 --> 00:07:46,593
I think we should end this
whole shitty thing right now.

76
00:07:52,572 --> 00:07:55,302
I'm sorry, sorry.

77
00:07:56,075 --> 00:07:57,906
It's just that you said
our relationship is shitty...

78
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:59,968
I'm sorry...

79
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:04,076
sorry.

80
00:08:04,183 --> 00:08:06,447
I don't like you.

81
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,985
I never have.

82
00:08:10,857 --> 00:08:13,052
I've never liked anyone.

83
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:22,494
You're crazy.

84
00:08:24,637 --> 00:08:27,868
Now I'm the one who
doesn't want to marry you.

85
00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:35,144
I don't ever want to see you
again. You lunatic.

86
00:08:36,282 --> 00:08:38,580
The invitations are already
at the printers...

87
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:41,877
what is everyone
going to think?

88
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:24,596
- Another book...
- Yeah.

89
00:09:25,031 --> 00:09:28,933
How nice, Raymond.

90
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:31,593
Raymond, Raymond Chandler.

91
00:09:31,704 --> 00:09:33,934
- I like to read too.
- What?

92
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,409
I only read magazines,
ones about movie stars.

93
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,502
Ohh, soap opera actors.

94
00:09:42,782 --> 00:09:44,682
<i>I could wait a whole week...</i>

95
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,911
<i>just to see her turn around</i>.

96
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:54,727
Listen, I'd like some coffee.

97
00:09:54,727 --> 00:09:57,525
Not hungry again, huh?

98
00:09:58,197 --> 00:10:01,530
<i>I'd pay,</i>
<i>just to look at that ass</i>.

99
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:05,970
<i>Her name was a mixture of</i>
<i>at least three other names:</i>

100
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:10,372
<i>her father, her mother</i>
<i>and some movie star</i>.

101
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:51,570
Weird smell, huh?

102
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:53,612
Strange smell.

103
00:11:56,315 --> 00:11:58,078
Must be from the drain.

104
00:12:02,922 --> 00:12:04,753
How'd you get this?

105
00:12:04,824 --> 00:12:07,156
Family heirloom.

106
00:12:20,506 --> 00:12:22,269
$50?

107
00:12:41,026 --> 00:12:42,584
Howdy.

108
00:12:46,232 --> 00:12:47,824
Howdy.

109
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:51,764
No, no, not on
the table, rickety...

110
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:54,406
- Can I?
- What?

111
00:12:54,473 --> 00:12:56,202
Sit down?

112
00:13:00,045 --> 00:13:01,444
Right.

113
00:13:02,081 --> 00:13:03,446
Gracias.

114
00:13:05,818 --> 00:13:07,183
Does it work?

115
00:13:07,253 --> 00:13:09,221
- It works...
- Where you from?

116
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:10,856
- From Lima, Peru.
- Peru?

117
00:13:10,856 --> 00:13:12,551
- Yes, yes.
- Near Bolivia and Chile.

118
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,320
No, on the other side.

119
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:16,424
Does it work?

120
00:13:17,263 --> 00:13:22,257
Not really,
but it's an "ornamento".

121
00:13:22,334 --> 00:13:24,199
Avery nice ornamento,
very old.

122
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:27,762
Ornamento, what's an ornamento?
Like a decoration?

123
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,638
Yeah, ornamento, a decoration.

124
00:13:30,709 --> 00:13:32,540
Sorry, but not interested.

125
00:13:32,611 --> 00:13:36,206
You don't understand,
I've come a long way, by bus.

126
00:13:36,282 --> 00:13:39,774
Oh, by bus.
And you'll go back by bus.

127
00:13:39,852 --> 00:13:42,650
- To where, Peru?
- No, your house.

128
00:13:44,256 --> 00:13:48,852
This gramophone here,
it's got a story.

129
00:13:48,928 --> 00:13:57,097
Right, the bad smell... the bad
smell, it's from the drain...

130
00:13:59,138 --> 00:14:01,473
but come back when you've got
something more worthwhile...

131
00:14:01,473 --> 00:14:04,670
because "mi casa, su casa",
and I'll always be here...

132
00:14:04,743 --> 00:14:06,438
Ornamento, no.

133
00:14:06,545 --> 00:14:08,069
- No.
- No.

134
00:14:08,147 --> 00:14:09,944
Gracias.

135
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:14,243
Look...

136
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:17,485
life isn't easy.

137
00:14:18,224 --> 00:14:20,624
- This book the same as yesterday?
- Yeah.

138
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:38,502
If the food here was any good,
this place would be paradise.

139
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:44,947
I'll get you a soft drink.

140
00:15:12,378 --> 00:15:15,142
- Why'd you say that.
- What?

141
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:17,307
The bit about paradise.

142
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:21,176
- Let me have a look.
- You work here?

143
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:23,221
Security.

144
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:30,095
- 54 cards, all types.
- How much you want for them?

145
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:33,223
54 times 10, $540.

146
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:34,425
He won't even give you 10.

147
00:15:34,533 --> 00:15:37,161
He don't like this sort of thing.

148
00:15:37,236 --> 00:15:39,864
- He don't like this?!
- No way.

149
00:15:40,406 --> 00:15:42,567
- He queer?
- Since he was a little boy.

150
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:45,472
Shit... But wait, if he's
queer better for me.

151
00:15:45,544 --> 00:15:46,533
Fags have got good taste.

152
00:15:46,645 --> 00:15:48,112
They know how to appreciate
things. This is art.

153
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:50,916
Queer and has bad taste, if you
want, I'll give you 10 reais...

154
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:53,407
- so you don't lose your trip.
- But, from $540 to $10.

155
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,010
- It's up to you.
- Twenty?

156
00:15:56,555 --> 00:15:58,546
- Fifteen.
- Eighteen?

157
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:00,854
You got two?

158
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:08,233
- You can keep the box.
- None missing?

159
00:16:08,233 --> 00:16:10,463
None missing.
You can count.

160
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:14,196
You there with the violin.

161
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:23,808
How much?

162
00:16:32,358 --> 00:16:35,555
$100, maximum!

163
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:38,525
It's a Stradivarius.

164
00:16:42,801 --> 00:16:44,792
$112?

165
00:16:48,707 --> 00:16:51,267
That violin must have some story.

166
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:09,788
- This place smells like shit.
- It's from the drain there.

167
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:12,956
- No, no it isn't.
- Yeah it is...

168
00:17:13,065 --> 00:17:14,896
The Smell comes from
the drain in there.

169
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,968
You're the one that stinks.

170
00:17:18,137 --> 00:17:19,695
No.

171
00:17:20,672 --> 00:17:23,732
No way buddy I've got a problem
here in the bathroom...

172
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:26,435
here, in the drain.

173
00:17:26,512 --> 00:17:29,504
And who uses the bathroom?

174
00:17:30,282 --> 00:17:31,180
Me.

175
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:34,185
- Who else?
- Just me.

176
00:17:34,853 --> 00:17:39,881
So, where does
the Smell come from?

177
00:17:44,863 --> 00:17:44,897
- <i>Energy</i>.

178
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:47,695
- <i>Energy</i>.
- Energy to you too.

179
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:51,429
- <i>Energy,</i>
- Energy...

180
00:17:51,503 --> 00:17:53,372
<i>we're about to begin another show</i>.

181
00:17:53,372 --> 00:17:56,773
- Let's begin.

182
00:17:57,276 --> 00:17:58,937
<i>One, two and three and four</i>.

183
00:17:59,044 --> 00:18:01,103
<i>One, two and three and four</i>.

184

<i>One, two, and three</i>
<i>and four and do it</i>.

185
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:04,640
I'll do it.

186
00:18:04,716 --> 00:18:08,948
- <i>Hold and go and together</i>.
- And together, do it.

187
00:18:09,021 --> 00:18:10,511
- <i>And do it</i>.
- I'll do it.

188
00:18:12,524 --> 00:18:13,991
<i>Aê</i>.
- Aê.

189
00:18:14,059 --> 00:18:16,027
<i>Aê</i>.
- Aê.

190
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,824
- <i>Open</i>.
- I open.

191
00:18:17,896 --> 00:18:19,727
- <i>Hold it</i>.
- I hold.

192
00:18:19,832 --> 00:18:22,926
- <i>Lower your hips, stop, hold</i>.

193
00:18:23,001 --> 00:18:24,559
Hold, mad.

194
00:18:24,636 --> 00:18:25,864
- <i>Hold</i>.
- Order me around.

195
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:28,065
- <i>Hold</i>.
- Go on.

196
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,937
<i>Go on</i>.

197
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:31,100
- <i>Hold</i>.
- I hold.

198
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:32,074
- <i>Hold</i>.
- I hold.

199
00:18:32,144 --> 00:18:33,975
- <i>Hold</i>.
- Mad, I like it when you get mad.

200
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:35,376
<i>Hold the thighs</i>.

201
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:36,937
<i>Hold the thighs</i>.
- Thighs, didn't get that right.

202
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:38,676
<i>Hold the thighs</i>.
- Thighs, didn't get that right.

203
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:41,651
<i>Hold the thighs</i>.

204
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,585
- Thighs?
- <i>Hold the thighs</i>.

205
00:18:43,655 --> 00:18:45,020
I don't think I got that right.

206
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,350
I'll be right back, OK?

207
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,163
- You busy?
- Yeah.

208
00:18:59,238 --> 00:19:02,002
- Aren't you going to let me in.
- What do you want?

209
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:05,942
You aren't going to get
rid of me so easy.

210
00:19:06,011 --> 00:19:08,275
I'm going to talk to your mother,
and tell her...

211
00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:10,549
that you called the whole thing
off with only one month left.

212
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:12,278
I don't like my mother,
I don't like you...

213
00:19:12,384 --> 00:19:14,477
I never liked anyone.

214
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:20,215
Life isn't easy.

215
00:19:28,066 --> 00:19:31,035
<i>Aiê, aiê!</i>

216
00:19:31,103 --> 00:19:33,094
- Aiê.
Aiê!

217
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:36,403
<i>Aiê, aiê!</i>
- <i>Aiê</i>.

218
00:19:36,475 --> 00:19:39,911
<i>It's time to say goodbye</i>.
<i>But don't forget...</i>

219
00:19:39,978 --> 00:19:43,345
<i>I can't believe in a god</i>
<i>who doesn't know how to dance</i>.

220
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:45,747
- <i>Sexy</i>.
- <i>Sexy</i>.

221
00:19:45,817 --> 00:19:49,218
<i>A big kiss from Samantha Rolls</i>.

222
00:19:51,089 --> 00:19:53,489
<i>If she was here</i>
<i>she'd slap me in the face</i>.

223
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,061
<i>I don't care about anyone</i>.

224
00:19:56,061 --> 00:19:57,262
<i>I just don't want them to think</i>...

225
00:19:57,262 --> 00:19:59,423
<i>that the Smell from the drain</i>
<i>comes from me</i>.

226
00:20:06,071 --> 00:20:07,561
I can't hear you.

227
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:08,970
I've got to talk to you.

228
00:20:09,074 --> 00:20:11,406
Mr. Lourenço,
they left this for you, sir.

229
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:20,913
You know that
God created the world...

230
00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:27,453
but it was man that created
comfort in the world.

231
00:20:27,526 --> 00:20:29,323
It's in the bible.

232
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:32,192
- Right, man is god of comfort.
- That makes sense.

233
00:20:32,297 --> 00:20:35,095
The only animal who
could do this is man.

234
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,293
You think a dog would
do something like that?

235
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:40,598
A giraffe, would do that?
Fucking long neck.

236
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:44,574
- And a whale, would do that?
- He'd get everything all wet.

237
00:20:47,312 --> 00:20:49,246
Only man is able
to make something...

238
00:20:49,314 --> 00:20:53,273
as comfortable as an
upholstery chair. Feel it.

239
00:20:56,321 --> 00:20:58,585
A jacket like this. Hum...

240
00:21:03,195 --> 00:21:06,028
But man filled the world
with bad things too.

241
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:07,690
- Like what?
- Garbage.

242
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:10,360
No, I don't agree. Garbage is good.

243
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:13,233
- Garbage is the payback.
- Payback?

244
00:21:13,305 --> 00:21:17,676
Man created garbage
to keep idle people busy.

245
00:21:17,676 --> 00:21:18,443
- Gotcha.
- You get me?

246
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:20,212
- Gotcha.
- Too many bums around, man.

247
00:21:20,212 --> 00:21:21,975
Shysters,
guys who don't take baths.

248
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,878
Don't go near a shower,
they're different from us.

249
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,781
Don't want to know about comfort.

250
00:21:26,852 --> 00:21:30,088
Man created garbage
to keep people like that busy.

251
00:21:30,088 --> 00:21:32,886
- Gotcha.
- The bum out front, could you...

252
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,153
- You want me to...
- Yeah, I do.

253
00:21:35,227 --> 00:21:37,752
- It's as good as done.
- Right? You got me huh?

254
00:21:37,829 --> 00:21:39,456
Gotcha.

255
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:42,066
You get me?

256
00:21:42,668 --> 00:21:43,600
Mr. Lourenço,
what should I do with this?

257
00:21:43,702 --> 00:21:45,465
Can't talk now.

258
00:21:48,607 --> 00:21:50,199
Excuse me.

259
00:21:51,376 --> 00:21:55,107
Listen, the bad smell
comes from the drain.

260
00:21:57,749 --> 00:21:59,478
- May I?
- Please.

261
00:21:59,551 --> 00:22:01,246
Thank you.

262
00:22:03,221 --> 00:22:04,916
- Fifty.
- Fifty what?

263
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:07,254
World Cup, 1950

264
00:22:09,895 --> 00:22:11,692
Ahh, a real beauty...

265
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:19,501
- may I?
- Please, help yourself.

266
00:22:20,238 --> 00:22:21,967
That's from... Newtonia.

267
00:22:22,741 --> 00:22:25,437
In celebration of the
independence of Newtonia.

268
00:22:27,212 --> 00:22:30,704
Well, listen buddy,
they're worthless for me.

269
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:34,519
But I need money bad.

270
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:37,113
You're loaded with money, right?

271
00:22:37,222 --> 00:22:39,918
Yeah, but it's that
this money is worthless.

272
00:22:39,991 --> 00:22:41,083
You can rest assured
that mine...

273
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:43,650
won't be worth anything
real soon either.

274
00:22:46,164 --> 00:22:48,758
- I'll kill you.
- Calm down.

275
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:53,605
The invitations are already at the printers.

276
00:22:53,605 --> 00:22:55,340
Take it easy.

277
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:57,331
There's someone else,
isn't there?

278
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:02,680
- Tell me you don't love me.
- You don't need it.

279
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:05,577
- We're going to get married.
- You don't need it.

280
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:07,948
- Yes we are...
- You don't need it.

281
00:23:08,019 --> 00:23:10,886
- I did everything, everything...
- You don't need it.

282
00:23:11,656 --> 00:23:13,392
You don't need it.
You don't need it.

283
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:15,952
I love you.

284
00:23:31,143 --> 00:23:33,441
Get out, I don't have
anything to offer you.

285
00:23:33,512 --> 00:23:36,106
And you have anything
to offer me.

286
00:23:57,869 --> 00:24:00,736
- Didn't bring the book?
- No, not today.

287
00:24:04,843 --> 00:24:07,471
You want a Cheese-sausage,
Cheese-bacon...

288
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:09,307
Cheese-egg,
Cheese-salad...

289
00:24:09,915 --> 00:24:12,110
Anyone will do, I'm...

290
00:24:13,518 --> 00:24:16,885
- Cheese-vinaigrette?
- Cheese-vinaigrette, OK.

291
00:24:19,157 --> 00:24:22,718
- Today's not my day.
- Mine neither.

292
00:24:26,765 --> 00:24:29,029
I brought you this.

293
00:24:31,102 --> 00:24:33,070
I hope...

294
00:24:36,942 --> 00:24:39,570
A movie star magazine.

295
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:45,112
Nice, thank you.

296
00:24:48,887 --> 00:24:51,913
<i>I wanted to grow old</i>
<i>alongside that ass</i>.

297
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:55,983

00:25:02,734 --> 00:25:04,497

<i>You hear me you son-of-a-bitch</i>.

306
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:25,610
How much?

307
00:26:29,454 --> 00:26:32,321
$200? $350?

308
00:26:49,874 --> 00:26:51,364
Changed.

309
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:57,048
You don't know how desperately
I needed money.

310
00:26:57,148 --> 00:26:59,013
You look like that movie star.

311
00:27:01,553 --> 00:27:03,953
You're sick buddy.

312
00:27:04,723 --> 00:27:08,921
You're all yellow!

313
00:27:20,505 --> 00:27:23,074
You know what I read in
the magazine you gave me?

314
00:27:23,074 --> 00:27:25,702
- The horoscope.
- And what did it say?

315
00:27:25,777 --> 00:27:28,813
Just good stuff,
that I'm going to be happy.

316
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:32,715
Let me ask you something,
you think I look yellow?

317
00:27:33,118 --> 00:27:35,253
- Yellow?
- Yeah, yellow.

318
00:27:35,253 --> 00:27:37,721
You think I look yellow?

319
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:42,320
Everyone who comes in here
is a little yellow.

320
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:52,265
Yeah, sure stinks.

321
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:54,567
It stinks, huh?

322
00:28:00,879 --> 00:28:02,614
Look, its all full of shit.

323
00:28:02,614 --> 00:28:04,912
We're going to have to break
the floor, it's the siphon.

324
00:28:04,983 --> 00:28:06,575
Siphon? What's that?

325
00:28:06,651 --> 00:28:09,779
Siphon is a siphon.

326
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:11,344
You're going to have
to break the floor?

327
00:28:11,423 --> 00:28:13,324
Break it all up.

328
00:28:13,324 --> 00:28:15,815
- How much is that going to cost?
- Around $300, $350.

329
00:28:15,894 --> 00:28:16,883
Screw you, man.

330
00:28:16,961 --> 00:28:19,191
Hey, take it easy,
show some respect.

331
00:28:19,264 --> 00:28:20,665
If it's that much,
I prefer the smell.

332
00:28:20,665 --> 00:28:22,690
So keep the smell,
and the price is only labor...

333
00:28:22,767 --> 00:28:25,235
- without material.
- That's it then.

334
00:28:25,303 --> 00:28:27,100
Get your things and beat it.

335
00:28:27,172 --> 00:28:28,196
Sticking your hand in their
like some fag...

336
00:28:28,273 --> 00:28:30,173
didn't even take a good look.

337
00:28:36,481 --> 00:28:38,972
But if you eat that shit,
I'll give you $300.

338

<i>I'll cement it tomorrow</i>.

346
00:30:20,351 --> 00:30:21,409
You call?

347
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:25,183
Go buy some cement.
Go on, move it..

348
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:26,689
Yes sir.

349
00:30:49,781 --> 00:30:52,147
Could you please not make
that noise on your way back.

350
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:14,869
Sit down.

351
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:26,913
$50. Ohh, sorry
about the smell.

352
00:31:27,018 --> 00:31:29,782
- No problem.
- I got a problem in the drain.

353
00:31:29,854 --> 00:31:31,685
- In the bathroom, it's...
- Clogged?

354
00:31:31,756 --> 00:31:34,884
No, it'll get clogged as soon
as I fill it with cement...

355
00:31:37,762 --> 00:31:40,754
So, $50?

356
00:31:40,865 --> 00:31:43,163
Not enough,
the eye is worth more.

357
00:31:43,701 --> 00:31:46,431
That eye has seen everything.

358
00:31:49,807 --> 00:31:52,605
But that's the most I can pay.

359
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:56,679
Maybe next time.

360
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:05,913
- $100?
- Still not enough.

361
00:32:06,891 --> 00:32:08,483
How much?

362
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:14,398
$400.

363
00:32:19,637 --> 00:32:21,161
No.

364
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:26,175
- $400 is too much.
- No problem.

365
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:29,943
Maybe next time.

366
00:32:58,576 --> 00:33:00,601
You drive a hard bargain.

367
00:33:10,288 --> 00:33:11,846
No.

368
00:33:13,424 --> 00:33:16,154
This eye hasn't seen everything.

369
00:33:18,296 --> 00:33:20,230
It hasn't seen the ass yet.

370
00:33:34,112 --> 00:33:35,739
Crazy.

371
00:33:40,284 --> 00:33:41,911
Wait!

372
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,954
I want to show you something.

373
00:33:50,495 --> 00:33:52,429
Wow!

374
00:33:53,998 --> 00:33:57,297
Shit, outasight.

375
00:33:58,336 --> 00:34:00,429
This eye here used
to belong to my father.

376
00:34:00,505 --> 00:34:03,030
- Really, your father?
- Yeah.

377
00:34:03,107 --> 00:34:05,473
I've had this eye
since I was a little kid.

378
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:10,776
- Nice, your dad die?
- Yeah, in the war.

379
00:34:11,416 --> 00:34:14,408
- What war?
- Second World War.

380
00:34:16,521 --> 00:34:19,115
I never knew anyone
who died in the war.

381
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:24,320
- That's because you're too young.
- Yeah, that's true.

382
00:34:28,766 --> 00:34:33,066
You're kinda nice. You even look
like that guy in the add.

383
00:34:33,137 --> 00:34:35,332
So I've been told.

384
00:34:37,341 --> 00:34:40,504
I've got to go,
I think your eye is great.

385
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:44,173
- Outasight, huh?
- Outasight.

386
00:35:01,899 --> 00:35:03,491
OK then.

387
00:35:10,508 --> 00:35:11,975
What's that?

388
00:35:12,043 --> 00:35:14,739
- A rake.
- A rake?

389
00:35:14,812 --> 00:35:16,643
Garden rake.

390
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:22,686
- You got a country home?
- No.

391
00:35:23,387 --> 00:35:26,117
- You weed?
- If I weed?

392
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:28,249
- Yeah?
- No.

393
00:35:29,327 --> 00:35:32,990
You use this to gather
dry leaves after they fall...

394
00:35:33,064 --> 00:35:35,191
or weeds after weeding.

395
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,329
Gather weeds, huh?

396
00:35:37,401 --> 00:35:39,699
- Pretty useful, huh?
- Yeah.

397
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:41,635
I'll take it.

398
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:44,338
You won't be sorry, no way.

399
00:35:44,408 --> 00:35:46,535
$10?

400
00:35:48,579 --> 00:35:50,479
$20?

401
00:35:55,419 --> 00:35:56,943
Let me show you
something, look...

402
00:35:58,189 --> 00:36:00,214
- What's that?
- My father's eye.

403
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:20,770
- You order pizza?
- Yeah.

404
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:22,642
Excuse me.

405
00:36:26,551 --> 00:36:28,686
- Keep the change.
- Thank you, enjoy.

406
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:30,517
Let me show you something?

407
00:36:31,489 --> 00:36:34,356
Wow, man, that's weird.
Where'd you get that from?

408
00:36:34,425 --> 00:36:36,052
It came in a pizza.

409
00:36:36,127 --> 00:36:38,527
- From our pizza joint?
- No, this other one I order from.

410
00:36:39,163 --> 00:36:41,222
Freaking one-eyed pizza maker...

411
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,158
Man, it reminds me
of those munchies.

412
00:36:44,235 --> 00:36:45,497
What munchies?

413
00:36:45,603 --> 00:36:47,972
The kind that
look like fingers...

414
00:36:47,972 --> 00:36:50,702
ears, really weird looking.

415
00:36:50,775 --> 00:36:52,675
Ohh... it kinda looks at us.

416
00:36:52,743 --> 00:36:54,643
Wow!

417
00:36:54,745 --> 00:36:58,340
Real weird man,
but I've got to go.

418
00:36:58,416 --> 00:37:01,180
I'll keep my eye on you,
as you go.

419
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:03,717
- Right on.
- Right on.

420
00:37:03,788 --> 00:37:05,619
- Thanks, bro.
- Thanks.

421
00:37:18,202 --> 00:37:20,329
It's gold.

422
00:37:25,876 --> 00:37:27,935
$20, at the most.

423
00:37:28,012 --> 00:37:29,843
But, it's gold.

424
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:33,042
- Not interested.
- Why not?

425
00:37:34,051 --> 00:37:35,814
Because I don't like your face.

426
00:37:35,886 --> 00:37:38,821
Sorry about my face...

427
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:45,093
but that's not what I'm
offering you, it's the pen.

428
00:37:45,162 --> 00:37:48,461
Don't want it.

429
00:37:48,532 --> 00:37:51,092
I need the money real bad.

430
00:37:52,069 --> 00:37:54,060
Would you do anything
to get the money?

431
00:37:54,205 --> 00:38:01,043
Not anything, no.
I've got principles.

432
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:05,242
How far do your principles go?

433
00:38:05,316 --> 00:38:06,647
What do you want me to do?

434
00:38:06,717 --> 00:38:08,052
Nothing, you can go.

435
00:38:08,052 --> 00:38:10,577
Aren't you even go to make me
an offer on the pen?

436
00:38:10,655 --> 00:38:13,818
I already have,
but I take it back.

437
00:38:15,259 --> 00:38:17,159
I'm not going to help you.

438
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:21,557
Go on, leave.

439
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:52,088
Long time no see,
get tired of paradise?

440
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:53,460
- Almost.
- Really?

441
00:38:53,531 --> 00:38:55,556
No, but I went
from paradise to hell.

442
00:38:55,633 --> 00:38:58,035
I've got a couple
problems myself.

443
00:38:58,035 --> 00:38:59,866
- Life isn't easy.
- Cheese-vinaigrette?

444
00:38:59,937 --> 00:39:01,272
- Great.
- To drink, the usual?

445
00:39:01,272 --> 00:39:03,240
- The usual.
- OK then.

446
00:39:18,255 --> 00:39:19,813
Thank you...

447
00:39:23,594 --> 00:39:25,528
- I'd like another one of these.
- Another?

448
00:39:25,596 --> 00:39:27,131
- For the office.
- But, sir....

449
00:39:27,131 --> 00:39:28,999
No need to call me sir,
you know my name?

450
00:39:28,999 --> 00:39:32,025
Lourenço. Right. OK then.

451
00:39:49,019 --> 00:39:51,715
What's the little
rascal looking at, huh?

452
00:39:58,095 --> 00:39:59,562
You...

453
00:40:00,598 --> 00:40:02,862
your body.

454
00:40:03,968 --> 00:40:05,993
You're a dream come true.

455
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:09,635
Paradise.

456
00:40:10,808 --> 00:40:13,244
That ass of yours.

457
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:17,237
- Just the ass?
- No, all of you.

458
00:40:22,553 --> 00:40:26,148
Today is Friday,
I get off at ten...

459
00:40:26,657 --> 00:40:28,147
why don't you come by
and pick me up...

460
00:40:28,225 --> 00:40:30,693
for a beer?

461
00:40:32,029 --> 00:40:34,999
- I can't.
- You married?

462
00:40:34,999 --> 00:40:37,524
- No.
- Because if you are, count me out.

463
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:39,865
No, it's just I've got some
things I've gotta do, at work.

464
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:42,773
- What you work with?
- Real estate.

465
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:44,909
OK then, maybe some other time.

466
00:40:44,909 --> 00:40:48,538
<i>It can't be like this</i>.

467
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:51,877
<i>If I start out this way I'm</i>
<i>screwed too many commitments</i>.

468
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:54,285
<i>And I'd rather pay</i>.

469
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:56,583
<i>I don't want to marry the ass</i>.

470
00:40:56,654 --> 00:40:58,815
<i>I want to buy it for myself</i>.

471
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:14,260
You again?

472
00:41:14,738 --> 00:41:18,174
Please, buy the pen.

473
00:41:18,242 --> 00:41:19,709
I've already said no.

474
00:41:20,277 --> 00:41:21,244
Just tell me...

475
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:23,848
what you want me to do.

476
00:41:23,848 --> 00:41:27,443
- What about your principles?
- I'll do whatever you ask me to.

477
00:41:27,518 --> 00:41:28,452
Call security.

478
00:41:28,452 --> 00:41:31,655
No, I'll do whatever you want.

479
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:34,852
For God's sake, help me.

480
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:38,195
Get this pile of shit out of my
sight, along with his fucking pen.

481
00:41:38,195 --> 00:41:41,494
C'mon, let's go.

482
00:41:53,277 --> 00:41:54,904
Beat it.

483
00:42:08,926 --> 00:42:10,027
<i>I think it was the violin man</i>...

484
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:12,496
<i>that said the smell</i>
<i>was coming from me</i>.

485
00:42:12,496 --> 00:42:14,623
<i>Right to my face</i>.

486
00:42:15,432 --> 00:42:17,525
<i>The worst thing is</i>
<i>that it hurt me</i>.

487
00:42:18,502 --> 00:42:20,671
<i>It was like</i>
<i>some vicious circle</i>.

488
00:42:20,671 --> 00:42:23,040
<i>I see the ass</i>
<i>which I thrive on</i>.

489
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,564
<i>The price I pay...</i>

490
00:42:24,642 --> 00:42:26,803
<i>is having to eat the garbage</i>
<i>they serve in the sandwich bar</i>.

491
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:30,472
<i>The food always goes down like</i>
<i>a rock, and so the drain stinks</i>.

492
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:33,949
<i>Or in other words,</i>
<i>the ass makes the drain stink</i>.

493
00:42:35,486 --> 00:42:39,047
<i>No, that's not it</i>.
<i>That's not how it works</i>.

494
00:42:39,156 --> 00:42:41,892
<i>Because even before I ever</i>
<i>saw the ass, the drain stank</i>.

495
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:44,861
<i>And the ass doesn't have</i>
<i>anything to do with it</i>.

496
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:49,522
<i>I sure wish that ass</i>
<i>was here right now</i>.

497
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,363
<i>But women are all alike...</i>

498
00:42:51,902 --> 00:42:52,703
<i>and if you don't watch out</i>...

499
00:42:52,703 --> 00:42:55,069
<i>the invitations will make it</i>
<i>to the printers</i>.

500
00:42:59,176 --> 00:43:01,838
I WAS IN HELL AND
REMEMBERED YOU

501
00:43:02,646 --> 00:43:05,444
Is today the day we're going
to have that beer?

502
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:10,787
What you thinking about, man?

503
00:43:11,889 --> 00:43:13,891
You're weird,
you some kind of fag?

504
00:43:13,891 --> 00:43:16,257
Let's have that beer.

505
00:43:16,327 --> 00:43:18,062
<i>She should be different</i>.

506
00:43:18,062 --> 00:43:19,757
<i>Things weren't supposed</i>
<i>to happen like this</i>.

507
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:21,131
<i>She's supposed</i>
<i>to be more bashful...</i>

508
00:43:21,131 --> 00:43:24,201
<i>sheepish</i>.
<i>Then I'd pay her</i>.

509
00:43:24,201 --> 00:43:27,037
<i>And she'd show me her ass</i>
<i>sort of against her will</i>...

510
00:43:27,037 --> 00:43:28,902
<i>because she needed the money</i>.

511
00:43:28,973 --> 00:43:31,271
<i>I'd be in command</i>.

512
00:43:31,342 --> 00:43:32,934
<i>She's breaking the rules</i>.

513
00:43:33,010 --> 00:43:35,444
I'd pay to see that ass.

514
00:43:38,382 --> 00:43:41,418
- How much?
- How much what?

515
00:43:41,418 --> 00:43:44,751
- How much, jerk?
- What?

516
00:43:45,556 --> 00:43:48,582
How much would you pay for me
to show you my ass?

517
00:43:48,659 --> 00:43:51,992
Spit it out.
I want to know, how much?

518
00:43:53,697 --> 00:43:55,961
$500?

519
00:43:57,267 --> 00:44:01,465
So that's how you get your kicks?
That your fantasy?

520
00:44:01,538 --> 00:44:03,267
No, it's my reality.

521
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:06,832
Get out of here you asshole.
Get out of here.

522
00:44:07,444 --> 00:44:08,342
Just because you've got money...

523
00:44:08,445 --> 00:44:11,107
you think you can treat
women like whores.

524
00:44:11,915 --> 00:44:14,748
Didn't you ever think that
I'd have shown it to you for free?

525
00:44:15,185 --> 00:44:17,517
Get out of here jerk-off...

526
00:44:17,588 --> 00:44:20,421
before I slap you in the face.

527
00:44:27,598 --> 00:44:30,431
<i>Weird, it was all so fast...</i>

528
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:33,629
<i>and I usually know</i>
<i>what's going to happen</i>.

529
00:44:33,704 --> 00:44:38,232
<i>Must be the eye,</i>
<i>yeah, that's it the eye</i>.

530
00:44:38,308 --> 00:44:42,301
<i>It's bad luck, it's bad</i>.

531
00:44:44,114 --> 00:44:47,777
<i>I know what happened,</i>
<i>it wasn't the eye's fault</i>.

532
00:44:48,252 --> 00:44:50,345
<i>It's just that I'm stressed out</i>.

533
00:44:50,421 --> 00:44:53,413
<i>That's why I absorbed</i>
<i>the vibes from everything</i>.

534
00:44:53,490 --> 00:44:57,294
<i>Because everything I buy has</i>
<i>a story, things have got vibes</i>.

535
00:44:57,294 --> 00:45:00,531
<i>And I wind up</i>
<i>absorbing them all</i>.

536
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:02,522
<i>but I'll change that</i>.

537
00:45:02,599 --> 00:45:04,567
<i>The Smell from the drain</i>
<i>is gone forever</i>.

538
00:45:04,635 --> 00:45:06,904
<i>My thoughts are flowing again</i>.

539
00:45:06,904 --> 00:45:09,702
<i>And today I feel a lot better</i>.

540
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:40,336
My father served in the army,
sit down.

541
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:43,335
Died in the Second World War.

542
00:45:48,779 --> 00:45:53,409
My father's eye,
he lost it in Monte Castelo.

543
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:56,386
I fought in that battle.

544
00:45:56,386 --> 00:45:59,355
Monte Castelo?
You were in Monte Castelo?

545
00:45:59,456 --> 00:46:01,947
- In Monte Castelo?
- I swear to God.

546
00:46:03,227 --> 00:46:08,460
I was with the Third Battalion,
Sixth Infantry Regiment...

547
00:46:09,032 --> 00:46:12,524
first reconnaissance squadron.

548
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:14,594
My father's squadron.

549
00:46:15,239 --> 00:46:17,400
Hail to the enlisted men!

550
00:46:27,584 --> 00:46:29,415
You fought alongside my father.

551
00:46:29,486 --> 00:46:35,288
It's true, my God,
how small the world is...

552
00:46:36,193 --> 00:46:38,753
I fought with your father.

553
00:46:40,330 --> 00:46:45,768
Looking better now,
you do look like him.

554
00:46:48,672 --> 00:46:53,974
- I saved his life.
- No. No.

555
00:46:54,044 --> 00:46:58,606
The time they threw a grenade...

556
00:46:58,682 --> 00:47:01,583
and I pushed him
into the trenches.

557
00:47:02,019 --> 00:47:07,116
It was close, real close.

558
00:47:13,630 --> 00:47:15,427
Good morning everyone.

559
00:47:16,266 --> 00:47:18,564
Today is a special day for me.

560
00:47:18,635 --> 00:47:22,594
My father died in the war.
My father's eye.

561
00:47:23,473 --> 00:47:27,034
And this amazing man
saved my father's life.

562
00:47:27,110 --> 00:47:29,947
So today is a day to celebrate.

563
00:47:29,947 --> 00:47:32,177
Will you accompany me
in this celebration?

564
00:47:32,249 --> 00:47:34,877
Anybody want money?
Anybody want a cigar?

565
00:47:35,219 --> 00:47:37,154
- Mr. Lourenço...
- Wait a minute.

566
00:47:37,154 --> 00:47:40,487
Who wants a cigar?
Money, who wants money?

567
00:47:41,425 --> 00:47:43,594
Around of applause
for this fine man!

568
00:47:43,594 --> 00:47:45,494
C'mon everyone.

569
00:47:45,562 --> 00:47:47,962
<i>Today was the day I was supposed</i>
<i>to have gotten married</i>.

570
00:47:48,031 --> 00:47:50,932
<i>The date written on the</i>
<i>invitations from the printers</i>.

571
00:47:51,435 --> 00:47:53,494
<i>Everyone hugs me</i>.

572
00:47:53,570 --> 00:47:56,039
<i>Everyone likes my money</i>.

573
00:47:56,039 --> 00:47:59,406
<i>Today I like everyone</i>.

574
00:48:06,984 --> 00:48:09,820
This is Steve who's autograph?

575
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:12,618
- Steve McQueen.
- What does he do?

576
00:48:12,689 --> 00:48:16,591
- Steve McQueen, the actor.
- Actor, you're from the south.

577
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:19,494
Steve McQueen,
the actor from Hollywood.

578
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:21,497
- He make good movies?
- For sure.

579
00:48:21,565 --> 00:48:25,194
- Example?
- Le Mans.

580
00:48:25,269 --> 00:48:28,636
- Never heard of it.
- The Getaway.

581
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:30,240
Man, you don't know
much about movies.

582
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:31,675
Not interested.

583
00:48:31,675 --> 00:48:34,011
Man, this is worth a lot.

584
00:48:34,011 --> 00:48:36,605
Man, I'm not interested.

585
00:48:38,181 --> 00:48:39,478
But I can tell from your looks...

586
00:48:39,549 --> 00:48:41,915
that you like exotic stuff.

587
00:48:42,019 --> 00:48:42,951
Exotic stuff?

588
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:45,923
Celebrity stuff.

589
00:48:45,923 --> 00:48:50,053
Everyone likes exotic
and celebrity stuff.

590
00:48:50,827 --> 00:48:53,022
Yeah, let me show you something.

591
00:49:03,206 --> 00:49:06,141
- That's exotic.
- Do you know who it belonged to?

592
00:49:06,209 --> 00:49:08,268
- No.
- That Stardust guy.

593
00:49:08,345 --> 00:49:11,281
- Stardust?
- Yeah, the one-eyed singer.

594
00:49:11,281 --> 00:49:13,545
One-eyed Stardust...
opera singer?

595
00:49:13,617 --> 00:49:16,051
No, rock, David something
or other. David...

596
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:19,316
- David, David...
- David...

597
00:49:19,389 --> 00:49:21,118
Well, man...

598
00:49:22,192 --> 00:49:23,026
do me a favor, leave...

599
00:49:23,026 --> 00:49:25,358
and tell the next in line
to come in.

600
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:31,559
- Sure liked that eye.
- Fuck off.

601
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:34,930
<i>Today, I feel more like myself</i>.

602
00:49:44,014 --> 00:49:46,209
What do you want to sell?

603
00:49:47,017 --> 00:49:49,679
The only thing you want to buy.

604
00:50:08,472 --> 00:50:11,608
- You frightened me Mr. Lourenço.
- What time is it Luzinete?

605
00:50:11,608 --> 00:50:13,166
Around nine thirty.

606
00:50:13,243 --> 00:50:15,677
I'm never late, what happened.

607
00:50:15,746 --> 00:50:18,237
Hold on,
I'll make you some coffee.

608
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:22,015
Make some coffee, coffee.

609
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:25,989
You cancelled your wedding,
didn't you?

610
00:50:25,989 --> 00:50:27,889
Sit down a bit.

611
00:50:29,192 --> 00:50:32,923
It's a long story, and I'll try
making it short for you.

612
00:50:32,996 --> 00:50:35,464
There's this bathroom
in my office...

613
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:38,394
and I had a problem
with the drain...

614
00:50:39,069 --> 00:50:43,972
and it started stinking up the
whole place, a very bad smell...

615
00:50:44,741 --> 00:50:48,700
and it started to get
on my nerves, irritated me.

616
00:50:49,579 --> 00:50:51,774
And I think I began
taking it out on everybody...

617
00:50:51,848 --> 00:50:53,679
on my life, I don't know.

618
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:55,342
Why didn't you have it fixed?

619
00:50:55,419 --> 00:50:58,081
I just never got around to it.

620
00:50:58,789 --> 00:51:00,950
Life is like that, Mr. Lourenço...

621
00:51:01,024 --> 00:51:05,017
we just let things slip by
and they start to get bigger.

622
00:51:06,129 --> 00:51:07,864
At first, we don't pay
too much attention...

623
00:51:07,864 --> 00:51:09,933
because it isn't that important.

624
00:51:09,933 --> 00:51:12,702
But they start growing,
getting bigger.

625
00:51:12,702 --> 00:51:15,728
Like a steam boiler,
and then they explode.

626
00:51:16,473 --> 00:51:18,202
You're right there.

627
00:51:26,149 --> 00:51:28,485
When I began to work...

628
00:51:28,485 --> 00:51:30,976
I had to be strong,
cold-blooded...

629
00:51:31,521 --> 00:51:34,046
because I buy things from people.

630
00:51:34,758 --> 00:51:38,091
I had to offer them much less for
their things to make any money.

631
00:51:39,329 --> 00:51:42,355
But, in the beginning
I felt sorry for them...

632
00:51:43,333 --> 00:51:45,460
but I couldn't feel sorry...

633
00:51:45,769 --> 00:51:48,363
if I wanted to get
to where I am today.

634
00:51:49,539 --> 00:51:52,030
So I began to be heartless...

635
00:51:52,142 --> 00:51:55,077
more and more unfeeling.

636
00:51:55,145 --> 00:51:58,444
And what did you get
for being so heartless.

637
00:51:59,616 --> 00:52:01,516
I don't know.

638
00:52:02,719 --> 00:52:05,381
Must be sad.

639
00:52:05,455 --> 00:52:08,117
I don't know if sad
is the right word.

640
00:52:08,225 --> 00:52:09,715
Would you like
some more coffee?

641
00:52:09,793 --> 00:52:12,455
Yes, Luzinete, that'd be nice.

642
00:52:12,529 --> 00:52:16,522
Mr. Lourenço, seeing that
we're here talking like this...

643
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:19,068
and I've worked for you
for eight years now...

644
00:52:19,136 --> 00:52:22,867
my name isn't Luzinete,
it's Josina.

645
00:52:25,342 --> 00:52:25,675
Hi.

646
00:52:25,675 --> 00:52:26,869
Hi.

647
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:29,301
What'll it be honey?

648
00:52:31,548 --> 00:52:33,383
I just wanted to apologize.

649
00:52:33,383 --> 00:52:35,908
For what I said the other day.

650
00:52:35,986 --> 00:52:37,521
The way I talked...

651
00:52:37,521 --> 00:52:39,751
I could have said it another way.

652
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:41,191
And I think I somehow
hurt your feelings...

653
00:52:41,191 --> 00:52:43,056
and that wasn't my intention.

654
00:52:43,493 --> 00:52:46,985
You're confusing me with the
other girl who used to work here.

655
00:52:48,632 --> 00:52:49,428
You're joking, right?

656
00:52:49,499 --> 00:52:51,990
No way, what'll it be?

657
00:52:58,375 --> 00:53:00,536
Could you just turn around?

658
00:53:01,978 --> 00:53:02,967
Turn around?

659
00:53:03,079 --> 00:53:04,247
Yeah, turn around,
just for me to be sure...

660
00:53:04,247 --> 00:53:06,016
that you're not putting me on.

661
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:07,881
OK.

662
00:53:07,951 --> 00:53:09,782
- You have her telephone number?
- Hey, man, take it easy.

663
00:53:09,853 --> 00:53:12,189
- Can you get her number?
- Me, no...

664
00:53:12,189 --> 00:53:13,679
I wouldn't even give it to you
if I had it, crazy loony.

665
00:53:13,757 --> 00:53:16,793
You have the telephone
number of the girl...

666
00:53:16,793 --> 00:53:18,420
- who used to work here?
- What girl?

667
00:53:18,495 --> 00:53:20,326
The blond girl,
you have her number?

668
00:53:20,397 --> 00:53:21,591
- No.
- Not even in your register papers?

669
00:53:21,665 --> 00:53:23,462
What registry, you think I
register anyone around here man?

670
00:53:23,533 --> 00:53:24,966
To pay vacations, pension funds?

671
00:53:25,035 --> 00:53:26,832
I'd go broke like that.

672
00:53:26,903 --> 00:53:29,463
- Can you get me her number?
- No, no I can't.

673
00:53:37,113 --> 00:53:39,513
Man, you look yellow.

674
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:43,546
Remember me?

675
00:53:48,491 --> 00:53:51,358
I brought you the watch
the other day.

676
00:54:36,773 --> 00:54:38,536
Mr. Lourenço, what is going on?

677
00:54:38,608 --> 00:54:41,076
He tried to rob me,
call security.

678
00:54:52,689 --> 00:54:56,090
This pig here tried to rob me,
take care of him.

679
00:55:17,681 --> 00:55:21,481
Poor guy, you'll
screw him up for good.

680
00:55:35,765 --> 00:55:37,357
You saw him attack me.

681
00:55:37,434 --> 00:55:39,698
- Didn't you?
- Yeah.

682
00:55:52,315 --> 00:55:53,839
How much?

683
00:55:54,584 --> 00:55:55,949
Around $30.

684
00:55:56,019 --> 00:55:59,079
No, how much do they weight?

685
00:55:59,155 --> 00:56:00,986
Around five kilos.

686
00:56:04,861 --> 00:56:06,453
Come here.

687
00:56:12,969 --> 00:56:16,063
- Strong smell, huh?
- It sometimes gets worse.

688
00:56:16,806 --> 00:56:19,969
look buddy, I'm sorry, but I'm
not going to buy your books.

689
00:56:21,177 --> 00:56:23,668
It's just, I didn't plan
on hauling them back.

690
00:56:23,747 --> 00:56:26,807
- Why, you drive here?
- No, I took the bus.

691
00:56:26,883 --> 00:56:27,975
Fuck off.

692
00:56:28,051 --> 00:56:31,145
Tough luck, ask the driver to let
you get in through the back door.

693
00:56:32,055 --> 00:56:34,956
Jeeez, you got shit coming
back up through the pipes.

694
00:56:35,024 --> 00:56:38,152
Do like the shit,
come back later.

695
00:56:46,369 --> 00:56:48,394
Who was the jerk
who plugged up the drain?

696
00:56:48,471 --> 00:56:50,132
I plugged it up.

697
00:56:51,474 --> 00:56:54,244
Amateurs. Try fixing
things themselves...

698
00:56:54,244 --> 00:56:55,845
without spending any money,
that's what you get.

699
00:56:55,845 --> 00:56:57,514
I don't like the tone
of your voice buddy.

700
00:56:57,514 --> 00:56:59,149
Yeah, I'm like that, I sometimes
say what I think, you got me?

701
00:56:59,149 --> 00:57:01,684
- You talk big for an amateur.
- I'm no amateur.

702
00:57:01,684 --> 00:57:04,744
I'm not saying you're an amateur
when it comes to shit and siphons.

703
00:57:04,821 --> 00:57:05,789
What am I an amateur in then?

704
00:57:05,789 --> 00:57:06,890
You're an amateur
in the art of talking.

705
00:57:06,890 --> 00:57:08,983
Jeez, seems like everyone's
a mental case these days.

706
00:57:09,058 --> 00:57:11,026
You don't know what you're saying
nor who you're talking to.

707
00:57:11,094 --> 00:57:12,228
Look buddy,
the conversation's great...

708
00:57:12,228 --> 00:57:13,456
but we're going to have
to bust this all wide open.

709
00:57:13,530 --> 00:57:14,326
I'll tell you
what you're going to do.

710
00:57:14,397 --> 00:57:15,762
You're going to yank out
this goddamn toilet...

711
00:57:15,832 --> 00:57:17,697
and plug up the fucking hole.

712
00:57:17,767 --> 00:57:20,201
Look, if we do that, you're going
to plug up the whole pipe...

713
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:22,795
shit will come out
all over the place.

714
00:57:22,872 --> 00:57:23,940
If you want, we can do it...

715
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:26,465
but how about doing it
the right way.

716
00:57:26,543 --> 00:57:27,840
How much will that cost?

717
00:57:27,911 --> 00:57:30,846
My partner takes care
of the financial part.

718
00:57:30,914 --> 00:57:34,372
Around two bags of cement,
two sand, a new siphon...

719
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:35,440
Do me a favor, while you see
how much it'll cost...

720
00:57:35,518 --> 00:57:36,815
get this fucking toilet
out of here...

721
00:57:36,886 --> 00:57:38,478
and cement the goddamn hole.

722
00:57:38,555 --> 00:57:39,852
But that won't fix...

723
00:57:39,923 --> 00:57:41,720
your problem.

724
00:57:41,791 --> 00:57:43,622
- Why?
- Because the shit'll back up.

725
00:57:43,693 --> 00:57:44,785
In here it won't.

726
00:57:44,894 --> 00:57:46,463
No, but it'll leak out
somewhere else.

727
00:57:46,463 --> 00:57:47,725
Screw it, it won't be my problem.

728
00:57:47,797 --> 00:57:49,594
Amateurs are full of shit.

729
00:57:49,666 --> 00:57:52,396
No, no way, shit is full of shit.

730
00:57:53,236 --> 00:57:54,703
And you two don't know
what's going on here, do you?

731
00:57:54,771 --> 00:57:55,999
- No?
- No.

732
00:57:56,105 --> 00:57:57,697
Why don't you just tell us?

733
00:57:57,774 --> 00:58:00,709
- Yeah, tell us.
- I'll tell you, come here.

734
00:58:04,013 --> 00:58:09,586
These drains
and pipes just seem...

735
00:58:09,586 --> 00:58:13,784
like the place where the water
and shit runs through.

736
00:58:14,390 --> 00:58:16,415
But they aren't.

737
00:58:17,527 --> 00:58:20,496
These holes are something else.

738
00:58:21,431 --> 00:58:26,528
They're portals, portals to hell.

739
00:58:28,404 --> 00:58:31,396
They spy on us through them.

740
00:58:34,777 --> 00:58:36,608
<i>The Smell from the drain</i>.

741
00:58:37,313 --> 00:58:38,481
<i>I get some strange</i>
<i>kind of satisfaction</i>...

742
00:58:38,481 --> 00:58:40,183
<i>when I say these words</i>.

743
00:58:40,183 --> 00:58:42,481
<i>It's like if I found myself again</i>.

744
00:58:43,186 --> 00:58:45,211
<i>Perhaps the Smell is mine</i>.

745
00:58:45,288 --> 00:58:47,313
<i>It was the Smell</i>
<i>that led me to the ass</i>.

746
00:58:47,390 --> 00:58:49,483
<i>A present from hell</i>.

747
00:59:04,574 --> 00:59:06,132
Hi.

748
00:59:07,410 --> 00:59:10,675
Can I bring something in another
day, cause I need the money.

749
00:59:11,314 --> 00:59:13,043
You smell that Smell?

750
00:59:14,083 --> 00:59:17,416
Yeah, I promise you I'll bring
something tomorrow...

751
00:59:17,487 --> 00:59:19,751
I just need a little.

752
00:59:19,822 --> 00:59:22,518
- Money?
- Yeah.

753
00:59:23,426 --> 00:59:25,758
Show me your ass
and I'll give you money.

754
00:59:26,629 --> 00:59:29,132
If I show you,
you'll give me some?

755
00:59:29,132 --> 00:59:30,929
You swear?

756
00:59:34,671 --> 00:59:37,071
Swear on my father's eye.

757
01:00:07,003 --> 01:00:09,995
Lower, lower, the panties too.

758
01:00:10,073 --> 01:00:11,131
The panties too?

759
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:15,074
Yeah, if not, I can't see
your ass, that's it, lower.

760
01:00:36,399 --> 01:00:39,061
- Can I get dressed?
- No, turn around.

761
01:00:40,403 --> 01:00:41,836
Turn.

762
01:00:44,507 --> 01:00:46,304
Pull up your blouse.

763
01:00:48,111 --> 01:00:50,079
That's it. More.

764
01:00:52,715 --> 01:00:56,845
More. Like that.

765
01:01:44,934 --> 01:01:47,704
<i>Power is like an aphrodisiac</i>.

766
01:01:47,704 --> 01:01:50,264
<i>The Smell gives me power</i>.

767
01:01:50,339 --> 01:01:53,706
<i>The Smell and the eye</i>.

768
01:02:45,228 --> 01:02:49,892
I WAS IN HELL AND
REMEMBERED YOU

769
01:02:50,833 --> 01:02:53,802
<i>I'm going to re-connect</i>
<i>with my real self</i>.

770
01:03:06,015 --> 01:03:11,885
<i>Life is a symbol</i>.
<i>The drain is hell's eye</i>.

771
01:03:11,954 --> 01:03:17,517
<i>Hell has only one eye</i>.
<i>Hell and my father</i>.

772
01:03:52,829 --> 01:03:54,160
Mr. Lourenço it's your mother.

773
01:03:54,230 --> 01:03:56,399
- Who?
- Your mother.

774
01:03:56,399 --> 01:03:57,533
Tell her I'm busy.

775
01:03:57,533 --> 01:03:59,330
But she needs to talk to you now.

776
01:03:59,402 --> 01:04:01,165
No way, tell her
there's a line of people.

777
01:04:01,237 --> 01:04:02,932
She said not to forget
your medicine.

778
01:04:03,005 --> 01:04:04,700
I won't.

779
01:04:04,774 --> 01:04:07,538
Excuse me,
there's people waiting.

780
01:04:07,610 --> 01:04:09,168
OK. Listen.

781
01:04:09,912 --> 01:04:11,573
Do you like it?

782
01:04:11,647 --> 01:04:14,343
- Like it what?
- The aroma of shit.

783
01:04:18,955 --> 01:04:20,445
I don't have anything else,
just this...

784
01:04:20,523 --> 01:04:21,888
I've already given you
everything I had.

785
01:04:21,958 --> 01:04:24,290
You never gave me anything.

786
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:26,462
I've always paid you
for your stuff.

787
01:04:26,462 --> 01:04:27,895
I've sold everything
I had to you.

788
01:04:27,964 --> 01:04:31,000
Did I ask you to sell anything?

789
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,560
No, you never did.

790
01:04:33,636 --> 01:04:35,570
And why did you sell?

791
01:04:35,638 --> 01:04:37,538
Because I needed to.

792
01:04:37,607 --> 01:04:39,768
Because you wanted to.

793
01:04:41,510 --> 01:04:43,501
Right.

794
01:04:44,180 --> 01:04:49,675
So say it, I sold my stuff
because I wanted to.

795
01:04:52,421 --> 01:04:54,582
I sold because I wanted to.

796
01:04:59,629 --> 01:05:02,223
- That plate isn't worth anything.
- But I need the money.

797
01:05:02,298 --> 01:05:04,892
If you need money,
you need to give me something.

798
01:05:04,967 --> 01:05:07,162
No, I didn't like
doing what I did...

799
01:05:07,236 --> 01:05:08,863
I didn't feel good doing it.

800
01:05:08,938 --> 01:05:11,702
So, go and get me
something worthwhile.

801
01:05:12,208 --> 01:05:13,232
But, I've got this plate.

802
01:05:13,342 --> 01:05:15,606
No, I don't want the plate.

803
01:05:19,916 --> 01:05:21,440
OK.

804
01:05:22,718 --> 01:05:25,084
Then, I'll do it...

805
01:05:25,154 --> 01:05:27,884
but it's only because
I need the money.

806
01:05:28,758 --> 01:05:29,986
It's the last time.

807
01:05:30,059 --> 01:05:33,051
Listen... you're doing because...

808
01:05:33,129 --> 01:05:35,063
I've never made you...

809
01:05:35,131 --> 01:05:37,656
I've never made you
do anything, did I?

810
01:05:38,301 --> 01:05:40,166
No.

811
01:05:40,236 --> 01:05:42,329
You never made me do anything,
but I did it against my will.

812
01:05:42,438 --> 01:05:44,463
That's what makes it so good.

813
01:05:45,608 --> 01:05:46,542
Only for you.

814
01:05:46,542 --> 01:05:49,033
Of course for me,
I'm the one who's paying.

815
01:06:03,926 --> 01:06:06,087
Fucking stench,
I think it's the siphon.

816
01:06:06,162 --> 01:06:07,459
No, it's not the siphon,
it's the drain...

817
01:06:07,530 --> 01:06:10,124
but I don't want to explain it
to you, what you got there?

818
01:06:10,199 --> 01:06:13,293
This here is a useless genie,
poetry is all it's good at.

819
01:06:14,670 --> 01:06:15,659
Even worthless to sell.

820
01:06:15,738 --> 01:06:17,603
So, I don't know
why you came here.

821
01:06:17,673 --> 01:06:20,301
But, I like your face,
you're alright.

822
01:06:20,409 --> 01:06:21,933
You remind me of an uncle I have.

823
01:06:22,011 --> 01:06:24,411
I'm going to show you something
I think you'll like.

824
01:06:26,449 --> 01:06:29,441
The eye from the man
in the dollar bill.

825
01:06:29,518 --> 01:06:32,817
No, no. Look this.

826
01:06:34,623 --> 01:06:37,786
Pyramid, the man, the eye.

827
01:06:37,860 --> 01:06:39,657
The eye from the man
in the dollar bill.

828
01:06:40,863 --> 01:06:43,058
Let me explain something to you.

829
01:06:43,132 --> 01:06:45,167
This is not the eye
on the dollar bill...

830
01:06:45,167 --> 01:06:48,193
because that eye
is the eye of God...

831
01:06:48,804 --> 01:06:55,177
and this here is the other
guy's eye. The other guy.

832
01:06:55,177 --> 01:06:57,145
The other siphon?

833
01:06:59,949 --> 01:07:01,041
Get this jerk out of here...

834
01:07:01,117 --> 01:07:03,142
and bring me the next guy please?

835
01:07:03,519 --> 01:07:05,384
- The siphon.
- Bye buddy.

836
01:07:38,421 --> 01:07:41,083
<i>Of all the things</i>
<i>I've ever had...</i>

837
01:07:41,157 --> 01:07:45,685
<i>those that were worth anything,</i>
<i>the ones I miss the most...</i>

838
01:07:45,795 --> 01:07:48,855
<i>are the things</i>
<i>you can't touch</i>...

839
01:07:48,964 --> 01:07:53,025
<i>the things that are out</i>
<i>of reach of our hands</i>...

840
01:07:53,102 --> 01:07:56,765
<i>the things that don't</i>
<i>belong in the material world</i>.

841
01:08:23,799 --> 01:08:26,700
That stupid jingle
the gas truck plays.

842
01:08:29,338 --> 01:08:31,829
You don't like it?

843
01:08:38,747 --> 01:08:40,374
$15?

844
01:08:43,119 --> 01:08:45,417
Yeah, you didn't like it.

845
01:08:46,555 --> 01:08:48,750
And I really need the money.

846
01:08:49,992 --> 01:08:51,254
Let me tell you something...

847
01:08:51,327 --> 01:08:54,524
this isn't just
any old music box.

848
01:08:54,597 --> 01:08:57,430
Yeah, I know, it plays that
stupid jingle the gas truck plays.

849
01:08:57,500 --> 01:08:59,161
That's not what I mean, no sir.

850
01:08:59,235 --> 01:09:00,327
This music box has been
playing this song...

851
01:09:00,402 --> 01:09:03,706
long before the gas truck
began playing it.

852
01:09:03,706 --> 01:09:06,903
And this music box is special.

853
01:09:06,976 --> 01:09:10,309
You know why?
Because it's got a story.

854
01:09:10,379 --> 01:09:11,347
And that's why
it's worth much more...

855
01:09:11,347 --> 01:09:13,315
than what you're
offering to pay for it.

856
01:09:18,387 --> 01:09:20,321
You know how to write?

857
01:09:20,923 --> 01:09:22,720
Yeah.

858
01:09:30,799 --> 01:09:32,790
So do me a favor...

859
01:09:33,169 --> 01:09:37,401
write down all the stories
about this music box...

860
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:43,710
because when I sell it I'll give
this paper as a bonus...

861
01:09:43,812 --> 01:09:47,509
to the buyer to know all the
stories about the music box.

862
01:09:47,583 --> 01:09:49,107
And then...

863
01:09:49,185 --> 01:09:54,316
it'll be a music box
with a story.

864
01:09:54,823 --> 01:09:57,121
You joking with me?

865
01:10:03,065 --> 01:10:05,968
Only reason I'm taking
this chickenshit...

866
01:10:05,968 --> 01:10:08,300
is because I need the money.

867
01:10:08,437 --> 01:10:10,673
But don't forget that...

868
01:10:10,673 --> 01:10:13,073
this music box belonged
to my mother...

869
01:10:13,175 --> 01:10:18,169
and she used to play
this song on the piano for me.

870
01:10:27,723 --> 01:10:29,122
Now when you want
to hear this song...

871
01:10:29,191 --> 01:10:31,421
your mother used to play you...

872
01:10:33,429 --> 01:10:36,421
you're going to have to wait
for the gas truck to come by.

873
01:10:46,342 --> 01:10:47,866
THE GAME

874
01:10:54,717 --> 01:10:56,548
For you.

875
01:11:02,358 --> 01:11:04,485
This music box
is full of stories.

876
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:08,052
You're a sweet guy.

877
01:11:18,207 --> 01:11:20,300
How do we begin?

878
01:11:20,376 --> 01:11:23,038
- Make me an offer.
- I've made it.

879
01:11:23,512 --> 01:11:26,140
No, it's got to be real.

880
01:11:33,022 --> 01:11:34,922
I'd pay to see.

881
01:11:36,091 --> 01:11:37,490
Pay to see what?

882
01:11:37,593 --> 01:11:40,027
You naked.

883
01:11:40,095 --> 01:11:41,756
What do you think I am?

884
01:11:41,830 --> 01:11:43,798
A slut, a little whore.

885
01:11:44,466 --> 01:11:46,991
"Ha, ha, ha", what?

886
01:11:47,069 --> 01:11:49,765
You need money, you're going
to have to work to make it.

887
01:11:49,838 --> 01:11:52,306
Work doesn't excite me,
order me to show you.

888
01:11:52,374 --> 01:11:54,239
Show me then you whore.

889
01:11:54,310 --> 01:11:56,478
Pay then.

890
01:11:56,478 --> 01:11:58,673
You want me
to pay you real money?

891
01:11:58,747 --> 01:12:00,874
Of course,
you want to see or not?

892
01:12:00,949 --> 01:12:02,814
Real bad.

893
01:12:05,654 --> 01:12:07,554
How much?

894
01:12:08,324 --> 01:12:11,191
How much would you
pay to see?

895
01:12:29,144 --> 01:12:33,672
Is that all? I think
I'm worth more than that.

896
01:12:38,721 --> 01:12:41,485
Is that all?

897
01:12:43,726 --> 01:12:44,886
Show me.

898
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:46,393
I think I'm worth more than that.

899
01:12:46,462 --> 01:12:48,521
Show me and I'll pay you more.

900
01:12:49,631 --> 01:12:50,495
Show me and I'll pay you more.

901
01:12:50,566 --> 01:12:52,727
Pay me more.

902
01:12:57,439 --> 01:12:58,997
You little pimp.

903
01:12:59,108 --> 01:13:00,442
- Show me more you slut.
- Disgusting.

904
01:13:00,442 --> 01:13:01,966
Show me more, I'll give you more.

905
01:13:02,044 --> 01:13:04,877
Show me more, I'll give you more.
That's it, more.

906
01:13:04,980 --> 01:13:06,345
- You bum
- Slut.

907
01:13:06,448 --> 01:13:07,244
- Pimp.
- Whore.

908
01:13:07,316 --> 01:13:09,409
- You wretch.
- Show me.

909
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:13,088
Show me more,
and I'll give it all to you.

910
01:13:13,155 --> 01:13:14,256
- In my hand.
- Show me.

911
01:13:14,256 --> 01:13:16,451
In my hand.
In my hand.

912
01:13:16,525 --> 01:13:18,925
Don't throw it like that.
Don't throw it like that.

913
01:13:21,663 --> 01:13:23,858
I'm a married woman.

914
01:13:26,702 --> 01:13:30,297
Do you have another box?
Is this the only one?

915
01:13:31,740 --> 01:13:33,207
Here.

916
01:13:33,275 --> 01:13:34,902
Take it.

917
01:13:36,211 --> 01:13:38,975
Here. Take more.

918
01:13:39,047 --> 01:13:42,505
Pay then.
I'm a married woman.

919
01:15:25,587 --> 01:15:27,384
You busy?

920
01:15:33,996 --> 01:15:36,021
You busy? Hey, you busy?

921
01:15:36,532 --> 01:15:38,600
Hi?

922
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:40,295
Hi.

923
01:15:40,369 --> 01:15:42,667
Who let you come in here?

924
01:15:42,738 --> 01:15:44,069
What are you doing?

925
01:15:44,172 --> 01:15:46,732
Who let you in?

926
01:15:48,744 --> 01:15:50,712
I won't do it today.
Here, take this.

927
01:15:50,812 --> 01:15:52,302
I don't have anything
left to offer.

928
01:15:52,381 --> 01:15:54,508
I've got twenty here,
take it. Go away.

929
01:15:54,650 --> 01:15:56,345
I don't have any more money,
I don't have anything.

930
01:15:56,451 --> 01:15:57,349
You're a big liar.

931
01:15:57,419 --> 01:15:58,613
Look... nothing here,
look, look.

932
01:15:58,720 --> 01:15:59,982
Why you saying that?
Why you saying that?

933
01:16:00,088 --> 01:16:01,919
What year were you born?
What year were you born?

934
01:16:02,024 --> 01:16:03,150
Sixty eight, why?

935
01:16:03,225 --> 01:16:06,217
So, how'd your father die
in the war, how'd he die.

936
01:16:06,295 --> 01:16:08,263
My father died because
of a hand grenade, why?

937
01:16:08,330 --> 01:16:09,524
- Alie, it's a lie.
- It's true.

938
01:16:09,598 --> 01:16:10,860
My boyfriend said...

939
01:16:10,933 --> 01:16:13,231
the war ended in 1945,
so it's a lie.

940
01:16:13,302 --> 01:16:14,530
Your boyfriend's a dope,
just like you...

941
01:16:14,603 --> 01:16:15,501
my father died before
I was born...

942
01:16:15,604 --> 01:16:17,094
- why are you saying this?
- Your father didn't die before...

943
01:16:17,172 --> 01:16:18,605
- you were born, no way.
- Shit, what's going on here?

944
01:16:18,707 --> 01:16:19,696
Nobody was outside,
I just came in.

945
01:16:19,808 --> 01:16:21,241
What do you mean, just came in,
what the fuck?

946
01:16:21,343 --> 01:16:23,311
- I brought some playmobils...
- Fuck your playmobils.

947
01:16:23,378 --> 01:16:24,675
I don't want this shit
here buddy.

948
01:16:24,746 --> 01:16:26,304
- He molested me.
- What do you mean, molested you?

949
01:16:26,415 --> 01:16:27,382
He was smelling the drain.

950
01:16:27,449 --> 01:16:28,541
- You molesting the girl man?
- He was.

951
01:16:28,617 --> 01:16:29,549
Me molesting.
I'm molesting the girl?

952
01:16:29,651 --> 01:16:31,084
- Are you craze?
- Me? Molesting the girl?

953
01:16:31,186 --> 01:16:32,312
Get him. Molested the girl.

954
01:16:32,421 --> 01:16:35,083
- Take it easy.
- You molesting the girl, man?

955
01:16:35,190 --> 01:16:36,851
Are you all mad?

956
01:16:36,925 --> 01:16:39,985
Girl? That girl is crazy!

957
01:16:41,463 --> 01:16:44,330
So, Mr. Lourenço,
what happened here?

958
01:16:46,401 --> 01:16:49,097
I don't even know what happened.

959
01:16:49,171 --> 01:16:51,036
One big uproar.

960
01:16:51,573 --> 01:16:53,131
What is it?

961
01:16:53,208 --> 01:16:55,438
No way. You've got to pay.

962
01:16:58,080 --> 01:17:01,183
The receptionist didn't know
where the security guard was.

963
01:17:01,183 --> 01:17:02,582
- I was taking a shit.
- What?

964
01:17:02,651 --> 01:17:04,846
Taking a shit,
when I heard this racket.

965
01:17:04,920 --> 01:17:06,410
Shame on you!

966
01:17:06,488 --> 01:17:08,820
People began coming in...

967
01:17:08,890 --> 01:17:12,053
I didn't see them,
all my money disappeared.

968
01:17:13,895 --> 01:17:15,294
My office was full of people.

969
01:17:15,364 --> 01:17:19,892
- Get him!
- Shame on you!

970
01:17:20,602 --> 01:17:23,366
- Son-of-a-bitch!
- Scumbag!

971
01:17:24,072 --> 01:17:27,132
- I went in and fired.
- At who?

972
01:17:30,178 --> 01:17:31,577
Into the air.

973
01:17:32,481 --> 01:17:34,574
Excuse me!

974
01:17:34,716 --> 01:17:36,479
Tumult...

975
01:17:36,885 --> 01:17:39,285
What can you tell me
about the naked girl?

976
01:17:39,388 --> 01:17:41,049
The what girl?

977
01:17:44,926 --> 01:17:46,325
Naked girl?

978
01:17:46,395 --> 01:17:48,090
The people in
the next store, said...

979
01:17:48,163 --> 01:17:50,495
a naked girl came running out.

980
01:17:58,840 --> 01:18:02,105
The scarecrow's crazy, worse
than the devil, bearded woman!

981
01:18:02,944 --> 01:18:04,707
She's completely insane and
came here to slander the boss.

982
01:18:04,780 --> 01:18:06,304
- He molested me.
- Who molested you?

983
01:18:06,381 --> 01:18:07,939
He. He was smelling the drain.

984
01:18:08,116 --> 01:18:09,811
- You molest the girl?
- Me, molesting the girl?

985
01:18:09,918 --> 01:18:11,476
- Accused him of rape.
- "Rape".

986
01:18:11,586 --> 01:18:12,575
Rape.

987
01:18:12,688 --> 01:18:15,623
I was molesting you?
I was molesting you?

988
01:18:15,724 --> 01:18:18,284
- He was molesting the girl!
- Take it easy!

989
01:18:22,030 --> 01:18:23,554
Was she pretty?

990
01:18:24,366 --> 01:18:25,924
Said she looked like the devil.

991
01:18:26,001 --> 01:18:27,992
Himself!

992
01:18:28,070 --> 01:18:30,538
<i>What else could she look like?</i>

993
01:18:31,106 --> 01:18:35,065
<i>Today, hell came out of the</i>
<i>drain just to pay me a visit</i>.

994
01:18:35,177 --> 01:18:37,543
ABSENCE

995
01:18:41,483 --> 01:18:44,919
You wouldn't believe it lady,
the hubbub.

996
01:18:45,921 --> 01:18:49,220
I wasn't here, I had some
problem with my intestine...

997
01:18:49,324 --> 01:18:52,919
but as soon as I saw what
was going on. I ran in and...

998
01:18:53,028 --> 01:18:56,794
The crowd dispersed
and I saved the guy's life.

999
01:18:56,865 --> 01:18:58,560
When I looked at him,
after everyone had gone...

1000
01:18:58,633 --> 01:19:03,070
his face turned red
in happiness...

1001
01:19:03,572 --> 01:19:05,802
I saved his life.

1002
01:19:05,907 --> 01:19:09,104
- Dr. Lourenço.
- Everything OK?

1003
01:19:09,177 --> 01:19:13,580
Nice to see you like this sir,
healthy, alive.

1004
01:19:13,648 --> 01:19:15,343
<i>The receptionist</i>
<i>was so frightened...</i>

1005
01:19:15,450 --> 01:19:17,941
<i>she ran off without</i>
<i>asking for her pay</i>.

1006
01:19:18,019 --> 01:19:22,285
<i>Now it's the stupid security</i>
<i>guard who attends to the clients</i>.

1007
01:19:22,390 --> 01:19:24,688
<i>He thinks he's</i>
<i>real important now</i>.

1008
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:27,456
<i>Little does he know</i>
<i>he'll be fired</i>.

1009
01:19:27,529 --> 01:19:29,224
<i>Life is hard</i>.

1010
01:19:31,900 --> 01:19:33,561
Hi. What'll it be?

1011
01:19:33,635 --> 01:19:34,260
Nothing...

1012
01:19:34,369 --> 01:19:36,394
just something to drink,
I'm not feeling....

1013
01:19:38,106 --> 01:19:42,177
Don't be sad, honey.
Here's a little present for you.

1014
01:19:42,177 --> 01:19:43,645
Your friend passed by
the other day.

1015
01:19:43,645 --> 01:19:46,409
- When.
- Around ten days ago.

1016
01:19:46,481 --> 01:19:49,177
Came to talk to Judith
about suing the boss.

1017
01:19:49,251 --> 01:19:51,481
- She's going to what?
- Sue the boss.

1018
01:19:53,555 --> 01:19:55,147
She left you a message.

1019
01:19:55,223 --> 01:19:56,781
- Left a message, what is it?
- Yeah...

1020
01:19:56,858 --> 01:19:58,086
Tell me.

1021
01:19:58,160 --> 01:20:00,526
Said she hadn't found
a job yet...

1022
01:20:00,595 --> 01:20:02,927
and that she was going
to sell you what you wanted.

1023
01:20:03,031 --> 01:20:05,158
Said you'd know what it was.

1024
01:20:06,434 --> 01:20:09,562
- Yeah, I know.
- Message delivered.

1025
01:20:09,671 --> 01:20:13,038
- Thanks a lot.
- For nothing honey.

1026
01:21:42,530 --> 01:21:44,327
It's Japanese...

1027
01:21:47,435 --> 01:21:49,596
belonged to an uncle of mine.

1028
01:22:00,949 --> 01:22:02,712
Thanks, huh?

1029
01:22:14,162 --> 01:22:19,429
<i>It'll be my father's leg</i>.
<i>And I've already got the eye</i>.

1030
01:22:19,501 --> 01:22:22,095
<i>I can put him back</i>
<i>together again in time</i>.

1031
01:22:22,737 --> 01:22:24,796
<i>My father, Frankenstein</i>.

1032
01:22:25,573 --> 01:22:28,176
<i>He only went out</i>
<i>with my mother once</i>.

1033
01:22:28,176 --> 01:22:30,178
<i>I don't even know his name</i>.

1034
01:22:30,178 --> 01:22:34,516
<i>He never saw me</i>.
<i>Never knew how much I loved him</i>.

1035
01:22:34,516 --> 01:22:38,086
<i>He left and I stayed</i>.

1036
01:22:38,086 --> 01:22:40,145
<i>He's sadder than me</i>.

1037
01:22:40,255 --> 01:22:43,122
<i>Because he probably</i>
<i>doesn't have anyone</i>.

1038
01:22:43,191 --> 01:22:47,355
<i>And I've got him</i>.
<i>My father Frankenstein</i>.

1039
01:23:28,303 --> 01:23:30,100
I'm not going to take off
my clothes today.

1040
01:23:30,171 --> 01:23:32,307
You've got something
for me today, right?

1041
01:23:32,307 --> 01:23:33,375
You liar.

1042
01:23:33,375 --> 01:23:35,240
Depends on your point of view,
how you see things.

1043
01:23:35,310 --> 01:23:36,402
Lies.

1044
01:23:39,647 --> 01:23:42,138
Even your face is a lie.

1045
01:23:44,152 --> 01:23:45,954
The face you wear
isn't even yours...

1046
01:23:45,954 --> 01:23:47,322
it's the face from the commercial.

1047
01:23:47,322 --> 01:23:50,018
It's a mask of the guy from
the commercial I use.

1048
01:23:51,593 --> 01:23:53,993
It's because
you don't have a face.

1049
01:23:54,729 --> 01:24:00,133
If you take it off,
you're left with a hole.

1050
01:24:10,245 --> 01:24:12,839
Go on, leave.

1051
01:24:13,548 --> 01:24:15,539
- Go on, leave.
- You look like a lie.

1052
01:24:15,617 --> 01:24:17,812
- And you look like the truth.
- You're a lie.

1053
01:24:17,886 --> 01:24:21,287
And you're the fucking truth.

1054
01:24:30,532 --> 01:24:31,760
<i>Hello?</i>

1055
01:24:31,833 --> 01:24:34,859
ONLY THE BIG BUTT
AND NOTHING ELSE

1056
01:24:54,889 --> 01:24:57,380
You don't know how long
I've waited for this.

1057
01:25:03,465 --> 01:25:05,330
Sit down.

1058
01:25:13,875 --> 01:25:18,209
I wanted to apologize, I
shouldn't have said those things.

1059
01:25:20,815 --> 01:25:23,807
- So, why'd you say them?
- It just came out...

1060
01:25:26,087 --> 01:25:28,385
But I wish I hadn't said it.

1061
01:25:29,390 --> 01:25:31,585
Not the way I did.

1062
01:25:33,795 --> 01:25:36,787
It made me sad.

1063
01:25:36,898 --> 01:25:42,200
I know, it made you sad,
but I was sad too.

1064
01:25:47,709 --> 01:25:49,233
Were you?

1065
01:25:49,344 --> 01:25:51,608
Very much...

1066
01:25:55,884 --> 01:25:58,876
because I like you.

1067
01:26:00,989 --> 01:26:03,924
Like me, or only my ass?

1068
01:26:04,025 --> 01:26:06,391
That's hard to explain...

1069
01:26:08,129 --> 01:26:10,290
Why don't you try?

1070
01:26:12,467 --> 01:26:14,799
I hadn't noticed you at first.

1071
01:26:16,404 --> 01:26:20,864
I only saw how beautiful
you were after I saw your...

1072
01:26:20,942 --> 01:26:22,569
You see?

1073
01:26:23,378 --> 01:26:25,513
You want me
only because of my ass...

1074
01:26:25,513 --> 01:26:28,049
if not, you wouldn't
be interested.

1075
01:26:28,049 --> 01:26:31,018
No, at first it was like that.

1076
01:26:33,321 --> 01:26:35,619
Now I want you.

1077
01:26:41,196 --> 01:26:43,664
But if you don't want me...

1078
01:26:47,669 --> 01:26:50,365
let me see your ass, just once.

1079
01:26:50,438 --> 01:26:55,000
From up close, just once.

1080
01:26:56,711 --> 01:26:58,838
I'll pay.

1081
01:26:58,913 --> 01:27:03,441
Before you said what you did,
that day...

1082
01:27:04,786 --> 01:27:08,222
the thing I wanted most was
for you to touch me all over.

1083
01:27:10,024 --> 01:27:14,654
I wanted to give myself to you,
not sell.

1084
01:27:14,729 --> 01:27:16,697
Forgive me?

1085
01:27:18,032 --> 01:27:20,193
Not easy...

1086
01:27:26,608 --> 01:27:30,044
If you want to work here,
as my secretary, if you...

1087
01:27:31,112 --> 01:27:33,842
need some money...

1088
01:27:36,150 --> 01:27:39,051
whatever you want,
the way you want it.

1089
01:27:41,289 --> 01:27:44,725
The thing I want most in this
world is to have you near.

1090
01:27:46,494 --> 01:27:49,395
What you just said,
that was nice.

1091
01:27:50,398 --> 01:27:55,062
Forgive me,
I didn't mean to hurt you.

1092
01:27:56,404 --> 01:27:59,066
I don't know if
I'll be able to do it.

1093
01:28:06,581 --> 01:28:09,607
- Nice place here.
- Yeah.

1094
01:28:13,054 --> 01:28:16,285
There's everything
the world has to offer here.

1095
01:28:17,025 --> 01:28:20,085
I think I should
just get it over with.

1096
01:28:20,662 --> 01:28:25,122
But we haven't agreed
on anything, like the price...

1097
01:28:38,980 --> 01:28:41,414
That's too much money
just to look.

1098
01:28:44,652 --> 01:28:46,745
I just want to look.

1099
01:28:48,723 --> 01:28:52,750
OK, but if you don't like it will
I have to give the money back?

1100
01:28:52,827 --> 01:28:56,160
No, no.

1101
01:28:56,230 --> 01:28:58,664
The money is yours.

1102
01:29:01,369 --> 01:29:03,303
No, no.

1103
01:29:05,273 --> 01:29:09,209
Let me see you in jeans first.

1104
01:29:09,277 --> 01:29:11,643
As I did before.

1105
01:29:14,315 --> 01:29:16,010
Button up.

1106
01:29:21,122 --> 01:29:22,749
That's it.

1107
01:29:28,396 --> 01:29:32,662
- Can I turn around?
- Yes.

1108
01:31:29,116 --> 01:31:34,288
<i>And so the ass becomes</i>
<i>one more object</i>...

1109
01:31:34,288 --> 01:31:36,090
<i>like all the rest</i>...

1110
01:31:36,090 --> 01:31:38,888
<i>like everything I lock</i>
<i>into the next room</i>.

1111
01:32:08,222 --> 01:32:12,522
I'm so happy, so nervous,
I hope I don't let you down.

1112
01:32:12,593 --> 01:32:16,051
Take down some things
you have to do.

1113
01:32:17,298 --> 01:32:20,062
Well, very old
or broken things...

1114
01:32:20,134 --> 01:32:22,967
you have to pre-select,
so I don't waste my time.

1115
01:32:23,971 --> 01:32:25,632
Another very important thing...

1116
01:32:25,706 --> 01:32:31,167
you never, never enter my office
without knocking first.

1117
01:32:31,279 --> 01:32:33,975
- Enjoy your work.
- Thank you.

1118
01:32:35,216 --> 01:32:37,616
I got another job.

1119
01:32:42,189 --> 01:32:47,286
He buys things, he helps people.

1120
01:32:50,331 --> 01:32:52,891
What you got for me
this time gal?

1121
01:32:53,668 --> 01:32:55,898
I brought you something
that belongs to you.

1122
01:32:55,970 --> 01:32:57,938
Let me see.

1123
01:34:25,126 --> 01:34:29,460
Lourenço! Lourenço!
Lourenço!

1124
01:34:29,530 --> 01:34:31,395
Lourenço!

1125
01:34:31,499 --> 01:34:33,899
You OK?

1126
01:35:03,431 --> 01:35:07,231
<i>And so now, nobody enters</i>
<i>and nobody leaves</i>.
