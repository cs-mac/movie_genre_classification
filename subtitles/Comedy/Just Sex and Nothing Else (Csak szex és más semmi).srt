1
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:48,938
JUST SEX AND NOTHING ELSE

2
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:42,291
Move over, honey!

3
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:44,533
Hey, move!

4
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:45,650
What?

5
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:47,731
Come on, you're in the way.

6
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:50,099
Sorry.

7
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:13,373
Hi!

8
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,295
Don't you recognize me?

9
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:19,976
It's me, Máramarosi from
high school!

10
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:21,414
- Hi.
- Hello.

11
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:27,499
- You are...
- I work here. And you?

12
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:31,812
I don't... work here.
I'm a script editor at a theatre.

13
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:34,011
- Great!
- Yea.

14
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:37,616
- Are you getting married?
- No, no.

15
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:41,290
A friend of mine asked me to pick
something out for her. Got to run.

16
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:45,652
I thought so. At our age you're
a reject if you're not married.

17
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:51,573
It's 12 more weeks to go.

18
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:55,138
- Congratulations.
- It's going to be the third one.

19
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:58,929
My husband wants a dozen of them.
How about you?

20
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:02,380
- Me? - How many kids do you have?
- Oh, five.

21
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:06,016
Seriously?
That's fantastic! Boys?

22
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:08,933
- Girls?
- Three boys, three girls.

23
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:12,254
Didn't you say you have five kids?

24
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:16,015
Oh well, I have to go home
and make a headcount.

25
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,011
Well, well, hey!

26
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:27,337
Could you give us a hand, lady?

27
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:46,334
According to the agreement,

28
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:50,290
the defendant cannot submit
any claim...

29
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:24,295
The lady has come to see me,
Magdika.

30
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:27,094
We are done for today,
you can leave.

31
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:30,739
Thank you.

32
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,011
Goodbye.

33
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:35,499
Goodbye.

34
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:40,770
- You didn't tell me you weren't
alone. - When could I've done that?

35
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:44,370
- We always meet in your office.
- I wanted to meet at your place.

36
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:47,936
- Why always my place?
- They're fixing up my apartment.

37
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:50,210
Everything is a mess.

38
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:55,979
Don't, my father used to
kiss me on my forehead.

39
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:58,296
Understood.
No kiss on the forehead.

40
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,489
How about a kiss on the back?

41
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,528
Allowed.

42
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:06,372
Kiss on hips?

43
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:09,898
Kiss on belly?
And this comes off.

44
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,413
Wait, wait!

45
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:17,056
- Let's just talk a little first.
- That will cost you.

46
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:21,014
- Alright, how much?
- Twenty grand per hour plus VAT.

47
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:23,780
Ripoff! And what's the VAT for?

48
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:26,972
- Very Aroused Tax.
- Very funny.

49
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,659
Very serious.

50
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:35,138
- Do you like children at all?
- I'm not a pedophile.

51
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:40,016
- I know it's against the law.
- Can we talk seriously for once?

52
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:43,016
I'm very serious.

53
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:49,776
Happy birthday, sweetie.

54
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:51,488
What's this?!

55
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:56,019
They only had this
with Mickey Mouse on it.

56
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:59,012
What's the matter?

57
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:04,973
- I'm thirty two years old.
- Sweetheart, you know I adore you!

58
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:09,612
Look, I've got something else, too.

59
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:16,018
I knew it, I knew it!

60
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:19,612
I love you!

61
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:23,179
Without you I'm like a fallow field,

62
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:26,932
a forest without leaves,
empty and sad.

63
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:29,059
You mean it?

64
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:35,968
Shit!

65
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:39,213
I'll see who it is.
Just stay here.

66
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,333
- You have to leave!
- Why?

67
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:51,418
A client Very important.

68
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,895
- Now?
- I completely forgot about him.

69
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:56,056
Shall I fly out the window?

70
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:58,012
Not a bad idea.

71
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:01,935
- Are you crazy?
- It won't be long. -András!

72
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:04,813
- Just a minute.
- András!

73
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:14,416
Oh, baby, jump!
I'll catch you.

74
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:18,619
I'm driving.
I'm on the highway.

75
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,936
Can't you hear the traffic?

76
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,177
You are overdressed!

77
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:25,735
No, you can't call me now.

78
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:28,491
Get down! Get down!

79
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:31,129
I'll give you a call, okay?

80
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:34,049
Wait, my mobile is about to die.

81
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:41,699
Hello.

82
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:47,939
- Can you tell me what is so funny?
- It looks like I'm overdressed.

83
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:49,891
Get down!

84
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:53,088
The door is shut.

85
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:55,299
Mine isn't.

86
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,449
Shall I climb over?

87
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:01,772
I wouldn't mind, or they'll
never finish the pavement.

88
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:04,659
Alright, but stop staring.

89
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,689
Careful, careful!

90
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:21,096
Do you need help?

91
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:25,009
- Could you give me a hand?
- But then I'll have to look.

92
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:33,179
- I'd appreciate if you didn't say
anything. - I'm at a loss for words.

93
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:36,177
Lucky son of a bitch!

94
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:39,292
Isn't that the guy
from the commercial?

95
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:43,136
- Welcome. - Could you give me
something to put on?

96
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,617
Turn away first.

97
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:12,459
- Thanks. The lawyer will return it.
- Is that how you see your lawyer?

98
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:16,215
- Of course not. Something came up.
- His wife, I guess.

99
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:32,414
- I want my clothes!
- Don't make a scene!

100
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:35,896
- I want my clothes!
- András, who is it?

101
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:38,739
No idea... A Jehovah's witness.

102
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:41,209
Again?!

103
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:49,499
Jehovah's witness, huh?
Just come inside.

104
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,930
Hey guys, the show ain't over.

105
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,611
What's going on here?

106
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:11,454
Come back I'll cheer you up!

107
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:17,500
Hatred is a little death.

108
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:21,692
Anger kills the mind.

109
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:25,376
I respect myself,

110
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,975
I love others...

111
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:35,055
I love others.

112
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:07,413
What's happening with the text?
I'd like to read what

113
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:11,699
I have to direct before the
premiere. Get your act together.

114
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:14,175
It's me, Paskó.

115
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:25,374
- Good morning.
- You're late Miss Dóra.

116
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:29,010
They're all on the main stage.
Don't you have an alarm clock?

117
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:40,249
- What time zone do you live in,
honey? - Sorry.

118
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:43,617
Dóra Sárffy, our dramaturge.
Péter Markovics, composer.

119
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:45,691
And Tamás Szatmári
will play Valmont.

120
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:48,858
- Tamás Szatmári.
- Dóra Sárffy.

121
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:52,018
We have met.

122
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:54,569
Oh yeah? Where?

123
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:58,412
We worked together
on the balcony scene.

124
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:02,130
You've been here for two weeks
and you already screwed my editor?

125
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:06,455
Excuse me.

126
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,975
- Your coffee.
- Thanks.

127
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:13,538
I've brought one for you, too.

128
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,698
Miss Keresztesi hasn't arrived yet.

129
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,219
Wrong!

130
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:22,010
Dangerous Liaisons. If you've seen
the film, forget about it.

131
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:25,019
- This will be much better.
- Rehearsal!

132
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:29,179
Do I always have to wait for you?

133
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:31,776
"I deserve to suffer. "

134
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:36,053
"I know I've made a fatal mistake
and you'll never forgive me,

135
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:40,094
but please believe me I have always,
always loved only you. "

136
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:44,049
Who the hell did the adaptation?

137
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:46,850
Why?

138
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:51,133
It's awful. It turns Valmont
into a sentimental idiot.

139
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:55,936
- He is an idiot who wants to screw
every woman. -And he does, too.

140
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:59,729
By the way, his name
is pronounced "Valmon", no T.

141
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:01,935
It's French.

142
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:06,571
Standard procedure: we rehearse
first, then we trash the text.

143
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,289
Sorry.

144
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:14,620
- He's not an idiot.
- I said, we rehearse first.

145
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:18,218
"Without you I am like
a fallow field,

146
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:23,374
a forest without leaves... "

147
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:28,211
- Some people do talk like that.
- But who would believe it?

148
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:29,979
That's it!

149
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:34,528
Valmont is an idiot, Madame Tourvel
is a spinster but they still screw.

150
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:38,619
That's love. Then they die - that's
drama. Let's just continue.

151
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:46,458
- I would appreciate it if you didn't
tell anyone what happened. - Okay.

152
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,691
And stop reminding me too.

153
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:50,895
Okay.

154
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:55,169
And stop looking at me like that.
Just forget about the whole thing!

155
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:58,975
I'm trying but you stood in my living
room in your panties, didn't you?

156
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:08,457
- Enjoy.
- Thanks. Happy birthday.

157
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:10,455
Jesus!

158
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:15,613
She eats like a horse
and doesn't gain weight.

159
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:17,657
She must be bulimic.

160
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:22,172
Did you see the little bitch?
She's already hooked him.

161
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:23,978
Good for him.

162
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:29,890
He's got a great ass.

163
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:32,535
- Didn't you see the commercial?
- What commercial?

164
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:36,854
He is stark naked in it.
Has a cute tattoo.

165
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:41,173
You mean he flashes his ass
and Paskó brings him here?

166
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:43,815
Where did he find him anyway?

167
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:46,170
In Debrecen.
He was the local superstar.

168
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:48,814
He screwed the director's wife
and had to go.

169
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:51,050
Why am I not surprised?

170
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:54,019
If I were that handsome,
I would screw everybody, too.

171
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:57,212
- You screw everyone as it is.
- By the way,

172
00:14:57,420 --> 00:15:00,651
I need your burgundy lace dress.
I've got a date with Makai.

173
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:03,618
- The TV guy? Isn't he married?
- A little bit.

174
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:06,334
- Enjoy your lunch, ladies.
- Thank you.

175
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:16,249
Aren't they sweet? After 30 years
they still adore each other.

176
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:19,612
He's a deviation from the species.
The rest is like Szatmári.

177
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:23,733
- He would have sex with a fly...
- Flies? I wouldn't go that far!

178
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:26,852
Perhaps a sexy little goat.
But flies?!

179
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:30,889
Let me have a brandy.

180
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:36,418
Listen!
"Without you I'm like a fallow field

181
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:40,014
a forest without leaves. "

182
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:41,539
Really?

183
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:43,453
Wow, man!

184
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,976
- Hi Ali!
- Dóra!

185
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:58,609
I thought you forgot me.

186
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:01,779
- I was on a diet.
- Hungarian women very strange.

187
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:06,417
Always diet. But why? Who cares
about a toothpick in skirt?

188
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:08,736
Guys. It doesn't matter any more.

189
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:15,370
- Let me have this... and this.
- What you mean it doesn't matter?

190
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:19,175
Dóra whistle and Ali fly.

191
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:22,459
Thanks, Ali, I'd just
rather have something to eat.

192
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:24,178
That one too.

193
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:26,776
Dóra, I bring delicious zucchini,

194
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:28,976
cauliflower in yoghurt.

195
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:32,491
You want taste?

196
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:38,052
Delicious.
I'll just have the cake.

197
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:39,457
Right away.

198
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:43,297
- Here.
- How much?

199
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:45,178
Present from me.

200
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:47,976
The boss don't see, alright?

201
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:49,529
Thanks!

202
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:08,736
How much?!
Then I don't want a priest!

203
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:11,011
I'm not paying a fortune.

204
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:15,010
I don't give a shit about it.
About your mother, either!

205
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:17,131
Look, a miracle.

206
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:22,017
Sárffy, wait. Get me Markovics,
I want to go over the music.

207
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:27,490
Oh, and that bullshit about
the field and the forest is out.

208
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:29,771
- Why?
- Because I say so.

209
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:32,374
- My opinion doesn't count here?
- No.

210
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:35,128
Stop. Take this and
you get one of these.

211
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:37,539
Here, this is yours.

212
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:41,488
- Wedding? Again? You want to set
a Guinness world record? - Fuck you!

213
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:47,251
I don't mean you, honey.
Though now that I think about it...

214
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:50,535
Yours.

215
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:59,613
If you touch the dialogue again...

216
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:05,415
- What are you doing here?
- Waiting for Tamás.

217
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:10,096
- Paskó is looking for you. He wants
to go over the score. - I'm busy.

218
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:12,533
Have you arrested yourself?

219
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:15,089
Didn't think
I wouldn't be able to open it.

220
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:17,974
- Can I help?
- I would appreciate it.

221
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:27,258
What you played last time
was beautiful.

222
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:29,890
I love the way you play.

223
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:32,290
Your last album was great.

224
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:35,094
Too bad I'll have to play
with one hand.

225
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,370
The key must be here somewhere.

226
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:46,289
Am I interrupting something?

227
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:49,259
- No... but...
- There is a little problem.

228
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:52,777
If you need a whip, it's right
next to the testicle ring.

229
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:57,248
Could you tell me what you cut
from the text?

230
00:19:57,540 --> 00:20:01,294
- It read like the weather report.
- I've put a lot of work into this.

231
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,809
If you have a problem, ask me.

232
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:07,899
- I have. - No you haven't.
You trashed it. - Same thing.

233
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:09,653
Could you help?

234
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:16,937
Are you sure you don't want
to give him a good beating?

235
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:23,532
Here's your shirt.

236
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,778
- Zsófi!
- Come in.

237
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:36,133
- What are you doing here?
- It's the sweating lotus position.

238
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:39,776
Your orgasm will be
three times as long.

239
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:43,216
- But not right now...
- No. But it hurts.

240
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:46,499
Here.

241
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:49,056
Thank you.
I adore you!

242
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:52,730
- How long can I have it?
- It's yours. And these, too.

243
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:59,579
- And how do you hope to meet a guy?
Wearing sweatpants? - I don't.

244
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:03,659
I'll do fine by myself.
They're all jerks.

245
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:08,018
Honey, if all the women were
waiting for a normal guy,

246
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:10,256
the human race
would long be extinct.

247
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:13,020
Look at Makai!
We also had a bad start.

248
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:16,054
We spent all last weekend together.

249
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:19,449
Did I tell you he's taking me
to Mauritius?

250
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:22,373
- By the way, you have a date
next week. - Leave me alone!

251
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:26,573
Makai has a friend. Businessman.
Divorced and drives a Jaguar.

252
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:29,300
- I don't care.
- Twins.

253
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:33,777
- I don't care about group sex either.
- I meant he's Gemini.

254
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,891
I don't want to date.

255
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:37,973
Your business.

256
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:40,212
How do you like it?

257
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:43,053
- You look like a whore.
- Perfect.

258
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:48,729
- Don't drink that!
- What is it?

259
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:51,932
- Jesus! It's pesticide.
- Why did you put it in here?

260
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:54,530
I added some water to it.

261
00:21:58,620 --> 00:21:59,894
Listen!

262
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:04,893
I want to have a child.

263
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:09,651
You are kidding, right?

264
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:12,771
And with whom?

265
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:14,135
Nobody.

266
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:17,176
I've been looking for ten years

267
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:20,571
and all I found was lying,
cheating sex maniacs.

268
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:24,978
Why didn't you have a child with
that French guy? What was his name?

269
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:29,128
- Pierre.
- He wanted one, didn't he?

270
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:32,497
He did, but he forgot to stay
in the country.

271
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,975
And that cute sculptor?

272
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:36,932
He was a painter.

273
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:40,928
He skipped screwing his model only
when he painted a still life.

274
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:44,177
Well, a guy is still needed.

275
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:49,698
In the worst case
I can go to a sperm bank.

276
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:53,736
That's very romantic.
And when is that worst case?

277
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:56,778
Tomorrow.

278
00:22:58,060 --> 00:22:59,891
The procedure is very simple.

279
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:02,568
After an isolation period
of 3-5 days,

280
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:07,410
the sperm is extracted and placed
in a sterile plastic container.

281
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:11,938
Then it is stored in liquid nitrogen

282
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:17,049
at -196 Celsius. Let me point out
that we only work with

283
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:24,411
athletic intellectuals
and intellectual athletes.

284
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:32,215
Excuse me, where is the exit?

285
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:35,133
You're in the wrong place,
but you can go out this way.

286
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:37,092
Turn right past
the donor section.

287
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:40,056
- Thank you.
- Not at all.

288
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:14,259
- Man, that's all I need now.
- Why did you do it?

289
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,138
For the money, that's why.

290
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:20,373
You must have made a lot of money.
I wish someone paid me for my ass.

291
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:25,130
- Bury the thought.
- Nah, forget it.

292
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:28,332
- Are your mothers fine?
- Shall we try to take it down?

293
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:32,175
Are you kidding?
I'm going to use this on the flyer.

294
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:38,128
- Alright.
- No, don't!

295
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:40,576
- Hi everybody.
- Good morning, darling.

296
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:42,611
- We are rehearsing...
- Act ll Scene 3.

297
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:47,575
- Here's our posterboy! - Drag
your famous ass on the stage.

298
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:53,012
- Hi.
- Hi.

299
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:56,856
What's going on? A tea party?
Let's get going!

300
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:02,691
Dóra, listen. The maid has
a lot more dialogue in the novel.

301
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:05,209
But you're not playing the novel.

302
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:10,252
There is a cool monologue,
can I do it?

303
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:14,015
Sure. In your bathroom. Rehearsal!
Act ll Scene 3.

304
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:17,729
Tamás, I don't want any of that
macho bullshit today.

305
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:20,096
"Listen to me!

306
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:21,250
I love you.

307
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:25,258
You cannot even imagine how much.

308
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:27,775
I want you to be happy,

309
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:30,371
- very happy. "
- Tomi!

310
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:35,491
"I want you to be happy, very happy"

311
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:38,089
Don't drone on, okay? Vary it!

312
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:40,615
"Shed a few tears for me,
but not too many. "

313
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:44,210
- "Don't!" - "Why does it alarm
you that I could make you happy?"

314
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:45,290
No!

315
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:46,810
No!

316
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:49,888
I want to see that you crave her.

317
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:53,536
There is no one else in the world
only her, her, her!

318
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:57,369
- With these lines I can't.
- Fuck the lines! This is love!

319
00:25:57,740 --> 00:26:01,699
- It has to show even if you speak
Uzbek. - From the top?

320
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:04,170
No, from behind.

321
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:06,854
"Listen to me! I love you. "

322
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:10,934
Whose idea was it to bring this
wild boar here?

323
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:12,409
Yours.

324
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:16,049
The stupid ass that I am.

325
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:20,100
"I deserve to suffer,
I know I've made a fatal mistake.

326
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:22,939
But believe me, I have always,
always loved you. "

327
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:24,335
Dóra,

328
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:28,894
do something with these lines.
Leave me alone!

329
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:32,092
- I'm in deep shit.
- But not because of your lines.

330
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:35,690
- Your acting is shit.
- Telling it straight, huh?

331
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:38,534
Try not to focus just
on Valmont's dick.

332
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:42,379
Hear that?
All that practice for nothing!

333
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:45,373
Don't you want to comfort him?

334
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:48,339
I'm sorry! Dóra! Wait!

335
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:52,935
I'm sorry, I was a jerk.

336
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:54,733
No kidding.

337
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:58,013
The lines could still be changed.

338
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:00,609
You look stupid, do you know that?

339
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:02,731
I feel stupid, too.

340
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:06,898
I can't go back to Debrecen. If
I don't get a contract...

341
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:08,858
Tough luck.

342
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:11,376
Alright, what am I doing wrong?

343
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:14,248
Valmont is only interesting
if he has feelings.

344
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:16,729
He does! He feels like
screwing Madame Tourvel.

345
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:19,215
First. But then he falls in love.

346
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,730
But he could still act like a man.

347
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:23,575
Fuck!

348
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:27,051
- Is this what you call manly?
- Shit! Stupid pins.

349
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:31,930
Listen!
No one talks like Valmont.

350
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:35,969
- Bye.
- How would you say this:

351
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:39,576
Listen to me! I love you!
You cannot imagine how much.

352
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:42,016
I want you to be happy,
very happy.

353
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:45,775
- Shed a few tears, but not
too many. -Tickets, passes, please!

354
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:48,454
- Fuck off!
- You're not going to get away.

355
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:51,254
Leave me alone, man,
I use a carriage.

356
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:55,135
- Hey, was that you in that ad, with
the naked butt? - It's my brother.

357
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,251
- Dóra, wait!
- Alright, let's go!

358
00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:01,135
Dóra, wait! I'm not going back
to Debrecen, you hear? Let me go!

359
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:04,138
Just keep walking.
Pull yourself together.

360
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:07,816
- Look in the mirror, you moron.
- Who? Who are you talking about?

361
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:12,449
Makai is such a bastard.

362
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:15,695
I found out he still lives
with his wife.

363
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:18,454
And now he is in Mauritius
with a third woman.

364
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:20,975
Excuse me, may I get an autograph?

365
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:24,099
- Sure. What's your name?
- Lajos.

366
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:28,818
You know what?

367
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:33,053
I'll give you two tickets to the
premiere. Bring your girlfriend.

368
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:34,852
I don't have a girlfriend.

369
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:37,375
- Even better.
- Thanks!

370
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:51,412
Why is it that all normal guys
are taken?

371
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:56,216
Do you know who called me?
Simon, the alpinist.

372
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,775
The one who vanished
with your half a million?

373
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:01,614
- I hope you didn't speak with him.
- He was super nice.

374
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:04,610
Did you sleep with him?

375
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:09,019
- He brought me flowers.
- You're out of your mind.

376
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:18,099
Because of this stupid ad everyone's
been up in arms about my ass.

377
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:20,450
I can't go out
to meet women any more.

378
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:23,538
You don't have to screw every woman
you come across.

379
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:24,809
- Why?
- Isn't it better

380
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:27,255
if you needn't ask
the woman's name in the morning?

381
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:30,094
I don't ask.
I just call all of them "cutie".

382
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:33,053
Well it's still better to say
"Good morning, Dóra"

383
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:34,898
- than "cutie", no?
- Dóra?!

384
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:37,732
Dóra, Kati, Éva...

385
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:39,293
- That Dóra?
- Which Dóra?

386
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:41,098
- The dramaturge chick.
- She's Dóra?

387
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:42,779
- Isn't she Dóra?
- Yeah, Dóra

388
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:46,017
- Well, then that one.
- I didn't mean her.

389
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:51,532
She'd be alright if she didn't
act like a drill sergeant.

390
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:52,815
Well, go for her!

391
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:56,217
Me? It's you who haven't had
a girlfriend in four years.

392
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:58,052
I manage.

393
00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:02,008
- Yeah. Hands-on management.
- What are you? My libido manager?

394
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:04,610
You'll let me know
when you turn gay, right?

395
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:07,294
Sure. You'll be the
first one I'll lust after.

396
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:09,849
- Your cute tattooed ass.
- Get off my back.

397
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:12,013
Cutie.

398
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:15,215
I envy you. All you want
is a sperm donor.

399
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:17,536
If it were that easy I'd be
pregnant by now.

400
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:20,772
- Pick the first guy who has no
herpes. - What shall I tell him?

401
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:23,693
Hi, my name is Dóra and
I want to get pregnant.

402
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:27,733
You suck in your stomach, push out
your tits and talk silly. That's it.

403
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:29,933
Right now?

404
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:33,331
Wait too long and you'll skip
a phase and become grandma.

405
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:34,899
Thanks.

406
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:04,375
Dostoyevsky in bright sunshine?

407
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:06,850
My mother used to like vanilla too.

408
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:10,979
- Used to?
- She is in an asylum.

409
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:12,613
I'm sorry.

410
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:17,291
Could be worse.
My sister hung herself.

411
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:20,731
- Jesus! Recently?
- A year after my dad did.

412
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:22,777
Runs in the family.

413
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:26,137
Don't you ever think about death?

414
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:36,168
Next time I listen to you, hit me.

415
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:40,257
Why don't you use the personals?
I heard they work pretty well.

416
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:42,456
I'm not that desperate.

417
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:49,812
<i>Said to be attractive...</i>

418
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:53,297
<i>Attractive.</i>

419
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:00,577
<i>Sex goddess</i>

420
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:07,296
<i>looking for partner with negative</i>
<i>AIDS test. Just sex and nothing else.</i>

421
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:16,171
What are you doing here?

422
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:18,537
Me? Nothing.

423
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:21,620
You don't dig the guy either, huh?

424
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:24,418
Can you help?

425
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:36,129
This is not going to work.

426
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:39,173
Yes it will.

427
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:48,854
MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING

428
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,619
Super!

429
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:05,809
- That's it for now. At the end it's
the same refrain? - Beautiful...

430
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:09,573
It's good, but a little pale.

431
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:11,776
Pale?! I almost cried.

432
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:14,130
- Because you are nearing menopause.
- Please...

433
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:17,969
- Not you. Speed it up a bit.
- I'll try.

434
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:22,975
What if you brought back the part
that starts soft then picks up?

435
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:24,699
This one?

436
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:26,937
No, this...

437
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:36,254
- This sound came out of you?
- Did you study singing?

438
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:37,853
I know which one. This?

439
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:40,698
Yeah, that's it!

440
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:43,619
- You recognized it?
- It was okay.

441
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:46,778
- It reminded me of Kurtág.
- Don't you have to rehearse?

442
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:50,899
- Do you have singing gigs? - Sing
something so we can have a laugh.

443
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:55,935
You know when you'll hear me sing
next? When I'll serenade you.

444
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:03,454
- Here's that monologue, take a look!
- No.

445
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:05,970
Let's start the rehearsal.

446
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:10,133
I don't want anybody using a script.
Margitka!

447
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:13,650
- I'm right here.
- Good, let's get going.

448
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:16,290
Ms. Keresztesi hasn't arrived yet.

449
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:19,771
- Did you call her?
- She doesn't answer.

450
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:22,050
Shall I read her lines?

451
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:26,254
- Sárffy, get your butt on the stage.
- Me?

452
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:30,419
Yes, you! Valmont is sitting,
Mme Tourvel is on her knees.

453
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:38,014
For heaven's sake, Valmont.
Don't do anything crazy.

454
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:40,017
Valmon. The T is silent.

455
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:44,169
It's French.

456
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:49,978
For heaven's sake, Valmont.
Don't do anything crazy.

457
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:53,928
Too late. Your decision
has ripened mine too.

458
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:55,613
What is it?

459
00:34:57,540 --> 00:35:00,896
The only way to free myself
from your suffering.

460
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:03,494
What do you mean?

461
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:05,618
Listen to me!

462
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:08,658
I love you.

463
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:12,252
You cannot even imagine how much.

464
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:15,648
I want you to be happy,

465
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:18,458
very happy.

466
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:29,531
That's it!
Sensational!

467
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:32,015
I knew you had it in you!

468
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:35,013
Hey, where are you running?
Now comes the sex scene.

469
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:41,816
Are you mad at me? Why? Valmont
is not allowed to kiss Mme Tourvel?

470
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:43,618
- He is.
- And me?

471
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:46,334
You're unable to act like an adult.

472
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:49,008
Why do chicks go nuts
when they approach forty?

473
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:52,178
- What do you mean, forty?!
- Why? How old are you?

474
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:55,292
- Why? How long is your dick?
- One foot.

475
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:58,014
And I'm 20 years old.

476
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:14,973
Hello.

477
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:17,459
Looking for Zsófi?

478
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:21,173
I'm Charlie.

479
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:23,938
Glad to meet you.

480
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:31,295
Shit.

481
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:33,570
What's happening?

482
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,491
We got a little drunk.

483
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:40,052
- Not a little.
- Who is the Chippendale boy?

484
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:46,019
Could you ask him his name, where we
met and what it was like with him?

485
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:53,859
I'm splitting.

486
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:59,091
I'll call you.

487
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:06,368
He didn't even ask for my number!

488
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:08,811
How was the rehearsal?

489
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:12,850
- Paskó will kill you.
- I know.

490
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:14,778
- He is right.
- I know.

491
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:16,896
I subbed for you.

492
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:20,573
That bastard Szatmári
kissed me in front of everyone.

493
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:22,808
Lucky you!

494
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:25,813
Yeah, if you want to be chewed up
and spat out.

495
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:28,614
As long as I'm in his mouth.

496
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:31,689
- You'll wear this tomorrow.
- If I wear this

497
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:36,536
they'll rape me in the restaurant.
Are you sure this is a good idea?

498
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:38,339
Sure thing.

499
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:42,858
You take home the one you like,
drain him and never see him again.

500
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:45,853
I hope I'll meet at least one
who's acceptable.

501
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:49,378
I ovulate from the 19th to the 21st.

502
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:53,580
I have three more days.

503
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:10,409
If I twirl my hair like this,
call me on my mobile right away.

504
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:12,492
I'm so excited!

505
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:14,732
You're not running away!

506
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:24,936
I actually get along with my wife
quite well.

507
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:30,015
But after ten years
one needs a little variety.

508
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:31,415
Sure.

509
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:34,891
Here are things one can't do at home.

510
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:39,419
- Like what?
- I want to change your diapers.

511
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:44,809
We'll use baby cream, you wear a bib,
then we switch and you nurse me.

512
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:46,698
Hello! Yes?

513
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:51,655
You dance with him a little
then you two go upstairs...

514
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:55,890
There's nothing wrong with women...

515
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:58,574
a good thrashing to know
where it's at.

516
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:02,538
Open your heart to the Lord!
Don't be afraid!

517
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:06,334
I just got out. Let's go and do it.

518
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:11,571
Sandwich?

519
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:17,133
Just hit me and call me your slave!
Whip me hard!

520
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:24,739
After the surgery it will work
like the real thing.

521
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:40,578
"Just sex and nothing else"?

522
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:41,656
Yes.

523
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:44,294
- I'm Krisztián.
- Sit.

524
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:47,893
- I thought you were blond.
- Not on my head.

525
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:00,574
Dórika?

526
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:04,614
Tivadar, what are you doing here?

527
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:07,735
Are you the "sex goddess"?

528
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:14,935
Believe me, I didn't expect
to meet you here, either.

529
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:26,373
Well, after all

530
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:29,375
I've always liked you.

531
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:32,699
No, you misunderstand.

532
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:36,536
You take this home to Margit and
let's just forget about it.

533
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:40,055
Dóra!

534
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:42,053
Agyro, please.

535
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:45,292
Dóra sit, Ali bring it.

536
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:16,655
Thank you.

537
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:20,652
It's beautiful.

538
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:24,730
When do we go on date?

539
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:28,408
- Tell me, Ali, how old are you?
- Twenty seven.

540
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:31,054
And everybody in your family
has your beautiful eyes?

541
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:34,857
I have eight brothers and sisters.
All beautiful eyes.

542
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:37,298
Tell me, Ali...

543
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:40,974
- Do you like me?
- Very.

544
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:42,814
And

545
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:47,175
would you like to...

546
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:53,412
you know.

547
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:56,015
- Very.
- But it's not just sex.

548
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:59,772
- Ali is alright.
- I want to have a child.

549
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:03,416
Ali love children.
But I go back to Turkey.

550
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:06,253
No problem. The child will be
mine. I don't need a father.

551
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:11,454
Ali good father. I will be famous,
Guinness Book of Records.

552
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:15,609
- What record?
- I stuff twenty in one minute.

553
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:17,371
Pita.

554
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:19,895
But I still don't need a father.
Just sex.

555
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:23,135
Hungarian women very strange.

556
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:27,331
Dóra lives here.

557
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:31,293
- Do you have time today?
- No, no.

558
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:35,692
I have to help boss to pack,
then I go to Turkey.

559
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:38,778
I'm back in two weeks.

560
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:42,097
- But I ovulate now.
- Ali doesn't need eggs.

561
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:47,332
Sorry.

562
00:42:58,220 --> 00:43:00,814
- Traitor!
- You should thank me.

563
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:04,973
- All night he talked about his wife,
crying in my lap. - You deserve it.

564
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:15,213
- You have no idea what she's
really like. - No kidding.

565
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:20,739
She acts like a pussycat, comes
and goes. I could tell you stories.

566
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:22,499
Coffee, please.

567
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:25,129
Hey, Dóra,
I'd have never thought this.

568
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:26,938
What?

569
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:30,289
- Son of a bitch!
- But Dórika...

570
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:33,890
- Why did you have to tell them?
- Dórika, are you crazy?

571
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:37,775
I may advertise in the personals
but at least I'm single.

572
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:40,369
I don't know what
you're talking about.

573
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:46,414
About the perfect gentleman
looking for naughty fun.

574
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:50,059
Are you sleeping together?

575
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:54,612
Margit!
It's not that kind of fun...

576
00:43:56,180 --> 00:43:59,297
- Why do you have to mess up
everything? - Wait!

577
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:04,250
He talked about New Year's Eve when
you sang into a toilet brush.

578
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:07,095
Yeah, really!

579
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:09,368
Really.

580
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:13,574
Really?

581
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:21,612
Can you take this?

582
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:28,731
Where are you going?

583
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:33,056
At her age I can understand
that she takes out a personal.

584
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:44,938
- Get in! I'll take you home.
- Leave me alone!

585
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:48,371
- You'll be drenched.
- No kidding! Anything else?

586
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:51,335
You're not wearing a bra.

587
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:07,491
I don't live here.

588
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:11,574
I said I would drive you home.
I didn't say to your home.

589
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:17,179
- Would you like some wine?
- Yes.

590
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:20,170
Is this Miles Davis?

591
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:23,532
Yes. I once performed
with him in New York.

592
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:27,090
How was it?

593
00:45:27,380 --> 00:45:30,258
It made me realize how bad I am.

594
00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:34,052
Shit! It always happens.

595
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:37,298
I know how to make it disappear.

596
00:45:40,460 --> 00:45:44,214
That's coffee, and that is ice cream.
Sour cherry,

597
00:45:44,420 --> 00:45:45,853
ink, and my favorite...

598
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:49,977
Tomato paste.

599
00:45:51,100 --> 00:45:53,489
Don't ask.

600
00:45:56,780 --> 00:46:00,216
- Listen, that sex ad...
- You don't have to talk about it.

601
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:02,490
But it's so embarrassing.

602
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:04,617
Poor Margit.

603
00:46:04,860 --> 00:46:07,613
I screwed up a thirty-year marriage
in a second.

604
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:10,130
Chill out.
You can go on worrying tomorrow.

605
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:14,128
- I just don't want you to think
I'm a nymphomaniac. - You're not?

606
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:15,489
Damn!

607
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:22,175
Is this your wife?

608
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:31,851
- She was.
- I read about the accident.

609
00:46:32,740 --> 00:46:36,972
A drunk driver thought it might be
fun to drive in the wrong lane.

610
00:46:38,780 --> 00:46:41,692
Nothing has changed here
in four years.

611
00:46:42,140 --> 00:46:45,337
- Tamás says it's sick.
- Tamás is sick.

612
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:49,898
I thought you two...

613
00:46:51,140 --> 00:46:52,539
We aren't.

614
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:56,056
I do fine by myself.

615
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:03,809
A little more wine?

616
00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:06,740
- So, how was it with Markovics?
- Nothing.

617
00:47:06,940 --> 00:47:09,613
Jesus! What else do you need
to get plugged?

618
00:47:09,820 --> 00:47:11,776
He's been mourning his wife
for four years.

619
00:47:12,020 --> 00:47:15,092
How could I tell him:
Get me pregnant and get lost.

620
00:47:15,740 --> 00:47:17,332
Four years?

621
00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:21,136
- Wow, he must be starved for sex.
- I don't get it.

622
00:47:22,060 --> 00:47:24,938
All I need is an irresponsible,
insensitive guy

623
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:28,456
who knocks me up and leaves me.
Is that such a big wish?

624
00:47:28,620 --> 00:47:31,498
I don't know, honey,
you want too much.

625
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:35,058
I can't believe I'm unable
to find someone who...

626
00:47:39,020 --> 00:47:41,215
I'll hang up.

627
00:48:02,540 --> 00:48:04,337
What are you doing here?

628
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:11,653
What was that?!

629
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:14,972
I have this habit of kissing
unappealing people...

630
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:17,132
Yeah, me too.

631
00:48:35,180 --> 00:48:37,819
Listen, this is
just sex and nothing else!

632
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:39,891
Fine.
Can I smoke a cigi afterwards?

633
00:48:40,340 --> 00:48:43,138
We don't know each other
outside of the bed.

634
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:44,415
Good, good.

635
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:52,734
- And you can't tell anyone.
- That's going to be tough.

636
00:49:48,540 --> 00:49:49,859
Where are you going?

637
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:51,689
Home.

638
00:49:56,340 --> 00:49:57,932
The hell you are.

639
00:49:58,340 --> 00:50:00,331
We made a deal, remember?

640
00:50:02,220 --> 00:50:05,018
And if I promise I won't
marry you tomorrow?

641
00:50:07,180 --> 00:50:08,613
Sleep well.

642
00:50:13,580 --> 00:50:14,649
Now...

643
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:32,859
- You want to wear this on stage?
- Oh, it's just a symbol.

644
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:35,694
A symbol for what?
The mating season?

645
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:38,619
- Shall I put on something?
- Don't you dare!

646
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:44,731
How could I hope

647
00:50:45,140 --> 00:50:48,769
that of all the quivering
female hearts

648
00:50:49,820 --> 00:50:55,850
would notice me, little Emilie.

649
00:50:56,300 --> 00:51:01,693
Oh, dear Valmont, you are amazing.
Making my poor Dutchman drunk.

650
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:03,857
What is that?

651
00:51:04,180 --> 00:51:08,173
- There's a monologue in the novel.
- You said she couldn't do it.

652
00:51:08,460 --> 00:51:11,338
Naughty man.

653
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:15,049
- She convinced me.
- I thought you're getting married.

654
00:51:15,460 --> 00:51:17,815
Honey, spit out that chewing gum

655
00:51:18,220 --> 00:51:20,097
and show some life, okay?

656
00:51:20,340 --> 00:51:23,650
Alright,
but what is my motivation here?

657
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:25,379
Your motivation?

658
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:31,058
You want Valmont to fuck you hard.

659
00:51:32,340 --> 00:51:34,695
Is that enough for motivation?

660
00:51:35,580 --> 00:51:38,333
Oh, dear Valmont...

661
00:51:38,860 --> 00:51:41,658
you are amazing.

662
00:51:42,580 --> 00:51:45,413
This thing with Simon
might get serious.

663
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:50,612
What I dig about alpinists is that
they never run out of breath.

664
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:53,853
- What's the matter with you?
- Nothing.

665
00:52:02,940 --> 00:52:04,976
Ali!

666
00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:08,809
Dóra!

667
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:14,059
Don't worry.
You little tired but Ali ready.

668
00:52:14,420 --> 00:52:17,856
- I thought you left.
- Dóra need Ali, so Ali stay.

669
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:22,418
I'm sorry, Ali,
but I've found someone else.

670
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:25,208
- Better than Ali?
- Not at all.

671
00:52:25,420 --> 00:52:27,411
Things have changed.

672
00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:29,172
I'm ready.

673
00:52:31,140 --> 00:52:34,928
- Hungarian women like this.
- It's okay, Mrs. Szabó. It's me.

674
00:52:35,260 --> 00:52:38,650
No looking lady. Ali no peepshow.

675
00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:42,214
- I'm sorry, Ali.
- But I've got

676
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:48,092
pita, the heel cut off
the way Dóra likes.

677
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:50,770
Ali is an angel.

678
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:55,890
Angel, angel,
but I have to go home.

679
00:53:08,620 --> 00:53:10,417
No worry.

680
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:12,815
Ali doing fine.

681
00:53:13,140 --> 00:53:15,017
Stairs also fine.

682
00:54:10,020 --> 00:54:14,775
- What are you doing here?
- Good evening. I saw your ad.

683
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:20,209
Do you know what time it is?
How do you know where I live?

684
00:54:20,380 --> 00:54:23,816
- An important question won't
let me sleep. - What is it?

685
00:54:24,020 --> 00:54:26,375
You said,
just sex and nothing else, right?

686
00:54:26,620 --> 00:54:29,339
But you never specified how much.

687
00:54:29,980 --> 00:54:32,130
Just once, that's it.

688
00:54:32,580 --> 00:54:34,935
It's almost midnight anyway.

689
00:54:35,420 --> 00:54:37,376
Midnight is a very...

690
00:54:38,260 --> 00:54:40,137
special time.

691
00:54:42,820 --> 00:54:45,732
I hate when someone bursts in on me.

692
00:54:47,180 --> 00:54:49,614
Wait! What's today's date?

693
00:54:50,140 --> 00:54:52,734
The 21 st, for another half hour.

694
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:54,249
Alright.

695
00:55:17,980 --> 00:55:19,698
Stop staring.

696
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:24,336
- I'm ugly in the morning.
- You are stupid in the morning.

697
00:55:25,060 --> 00:55:27,176
- Stupid and ugly.
- Good.

698
00:55:31,420 --> 00:55:36,175
- Watch out, the handle is broken.
- What's this sticky stuff?

699
00:55:36,380 --> 00:55:38,940
Chewing gum. I had no glue at home.

700
00:55:39,180 --> 00:55:41,899
- I thought I was out of food.
- You weren't.

701
00:55:42,140 --> 00:55:46,053
This is leftover cheese
from 20 years ago.

702
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:49,252
And this jam doesn't look bad.

703
00:55:49,460 --> 00:55:51,371
That's my wax.

704
00:55:51,820 --> 00:55:52,809
Wax?

705
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:56,092
You need waxing?

706
00:55:59,220 --> 00:56:03,099
This much wax won't do.
We need a lawnmower here.

707
00:56:05,220 --> 00:56:07,609
Well, what are we doing today?

708
00:56:07,820 --> 00:56:09,572
You mean, together?

709
00:56:10,420 --> 00:56:13,969
- Shouldn't we start the day
with a song? - Leave me alone!

710
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:30,649
Look, this is not going to work.

711
00:56:30,980 --> 00:56:34,768
Alright, let's go see a movie.
Nothing intellectual.

712
00:56:35,140 --> 00:56:38,132
I watch the action
and you read the subtitles.

713
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:41,810
This is it for me,
I told you in advance.

714
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:46,695
I've got it, just sex. But between
two rounds couldn't we have a break?

715
00:56:46,860 --> 00:56:49,454
We both want something else.

716
00:56:49,620 --> 00:56:51,850
Yes, I want you and you want me.

717
00:56:52,020 --> 00:56:54,932
Good line. How many women
did you use it with?

718
00:56:55,340 --> 00:56:57,774
Come on, let's not start it.

719
00:56:59,140 --> 00:57:01,574
Shall I put it in writing
that I'll love you?

720
00:57:01,780 --> 00:57:03,736
That's what I was talking about.

721
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:06,972
You've made up your mind that
I'm a bastard, right?

722
00:57:07,220 --> 00:57:11,498
- What do you know about me?
- I know that you're going to hurt me.

723
00:57:11,860 --> 00:57:14,169
Well, I had other plans for today.

724
00:57:14,420 --> 00:57:19,175
I could cook lunch, see a film then
I'll eat ice cream from your belly.

725
00:57:19,340 --> 00:57:22,093
Today, yes. Maybe tomorrow
or the next week. And then?

726
00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:25,212
- I'm no psychic.
- And I'm no guinea pig.

727
00:57:54,860 --> 00:57:56,532
Listen, kids!

728
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:01,218
Shut up everybody!

729
00:58:02,460 --> 00:58:05,691
- Thanks for coming.
- Thank you for inviting us.

730
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:09,458
I swear,
this is the happiest day of my life.

731
00:58:11,060 --> 00:58:14,177
Isn't she gorgeous?
Look at this!

732
00:58:14,420 --> 00:58:17,332
The nation's best ass.
And it's mine!

733
00:58:18,020 --> 00:58:20,136
Enjoy the party.
We'll retire for a while.

734
00:58:28,260 --> 00:58:30,535
Have you seen the offering?

735
00:58:31,700 --> 00:58:34,897
What's going on with the alpinist?

736
00:58:35,140 --> 00:58:37,529
That bastard quit on me again.

737
00:58:37,740 --> 00:58:40,652
- But you didn't give him any money,
right? - No.

738
00:58:41,820 --> 00:58:43,219
Look at me!

739
00:58:43,780 --> 00:58:46,533
He helped himself. Took my TV.

740
00:58:46,820 --> 00:58:48,731
What can I bring you, ladies?

741
00:58:48,940 --> 00:58:50,817
A Martini, please.

742
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:54,139
- A whole bottle.
- Yes, madam.

743
00:59:08,980 --> 00:59:12,290
Son!
Was it you in that TV ad?

744
00:59:14,060 --> 00:59:15,539
Shall we dance?

745
00:59:16,180 --> 00:59:18,740
No thanks. Have you seen Tivadar?

746
00:59:18,940 --> 00:59:22,649
He isn't here. I've heard
he moved into the old actors' home.

747
00:59:22,860 --> 00:59:26,739
Those above don't look kindly
upon this. This nakedness.

748
00:59:27,140 --> 00:59:28,858
Come, visit me.

749
00:59:29,380 --> 00:59:32,497
I hold confession daily
from 2 to 4.

750
00:59:32,740 --> 00:59:35,618
- It's not your fault.
- The hell it isn't.

751
00:59:36,380 --> 00:59:40,658
And now every idiot at
the theatre makes a pass at me.

752
00:59:40,860 --> 00:59:42,976
And which one did you pick?

753
00:59:43,540 --> 00:59:46,816
The one that wanted to lick
my shoes.

754
01:00:28,220 --> 01:00:30,131
Careful, honey.

755
01:00:33,020 --> 01:00:35,853
- Come, I'll take you home.
- I don't want to go home.

756
01:00:36,060 --> 01:00:38,972
- You've had too much to drink.
- I want to party.

757
01:00:39,900 --> 01:00:42,892
- What's going on between you and
Szatmári? - Nothing, I told you.

758
01:00:43,100 --> 01:00:45,853
- He's been staring at you all night.
- That's his problem.

759
01:00:46,020 --> 01:00:51,094
If you pass on him I'll make my move
before that bitch gets there first.

760
01:00:56,820 --> 01:00:58,697
Want a little wine?

761
01:01:00,060 --> 01:01:01,698
What's this?

762
01:01:02,020 --> 01:01:06,855
I tried to cover it with a chair
but it didn't match my shirt.

763
01:01:21,140 --> 01:01:23,529
What's going on
between you and Péter?

764
01:01:23,700 --> 01:01:27,170
So, you've noticed me. I thought
Saci's breasts blocked the view.

765
01:01:27,540 --> 01:01:29,656
Or aren't they big enough?

766
01:01:30,180 --> 01:01:32,853
- Are you jealous?
- Jealous?

767
01:01:33,020 --> 01:01:36,410
Anybody who goes to the gym
eight times a week

768
01:01:36,580 --> 01:01:39,378
and can walk in those heels
deserves my respect.

769
01:01:39,700 --> 01:01:41,452
You're jealous.

770
01:01:46,100 --> 01:01:47,613
We are stuck.

771
01:01:53,180 --> 01:01:54,852
We'd better stop.

772
01:01:55,940 --> 01:01:57,214
I agree.

773
01:01:59,500 --> 01:02:01,730
Alright. What's today's date?

774
01:02:02,020 --> 01:02:04,773
- What are you? Pope Gregory?
- No, I just...

775
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:11,298
I'm crazy about you... Saci,
... Dóra...

776
01:02:19,540 --> 01:02:21,815
That's not what I meant to say.

777
01:02:22,220 --> 01:02:25,769
You mentioned Saci's name
a minute ago and that's why I...

778
01:02:28,180 --> 01:02:32,458
I didn't... I don't love Saci
I love you, I just...

779
01:02:33,700 --> 01:02:35,850
Go ahead, just leave!

780
01:02:36,220 --> 01:02:40,611
In 30 years, pushing a walker,
remember if you did the right thing.

781
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:44,092
- Gotcha!
- Yeah.

782
01:02:44,300 --> 01:02:46,814
- Am I disturbing?
- No, come on in.

783
01:02:47,300 --> 01:02:51,259
- I was worried when you ran out.
- It was a shitty party, wasn't it?

784
01:02:52,340 --> 01:02:54,251
You missed the best part.

785
01:02:54,500 --> 01:02:58,095
Paskó had a fight with someone
who sat on his wife by accident.

786
01:02:58,420 --> 01:03:01,059
- Would you like something? Tea?
- Thanks.

787
01:03:02,100 --> 01:03:04,773
I've brought you a piece
of the wedding cake.

788
01:03:06,940 --> 01:03:09,852
It's supposed to help those
who want children.

789
01:03:11,460 --> 01:03:13,690
Help yourself, I'll be right back.

790
01:03:42,460 --> 01:03:44,371
Ali, what are you doing here?

791
01:03:44,620 --> 01:03:46,736
I know you said
you don't want baby from Ali.

792
01:03:47,340 --> 01:03:49,695
You didn't see Ali's
erotic dance yet.

793
01:03:49,860 --> 01:03:53,899
- Ali, I have a visitor.
- The man who makes you baby?

794
01:03:54,140 --> 01:03:55,050
No.

795
01:03:55,700 --> 01:03:59,010
Another one.
I'm sorry I must go.

796
01:03:59,500 --> 01:04:03,379
- Once you want Ali, then you don't.
- I'm sorry.

797
01:04:11,060 --> 01:04:14,814
Ali said before.
Lady don't peek.

798
01:04:15,420 --> 01:04:18,378
Lady pay or close her eyes.

799
01:04:29,140 --> 01:04:30,858
What are you doing?

800
01:04:33,020 --> 01:04:36,171
I just wanted to pour some tea and
the handle broke.

801
01:04:36,700 --> 01:04:38,372
and I found this...

802
01:04:40,460 --> 01:04:42,610
I didn't mean to muck it up.

803
01:04:42,940 --> 01:04:45,852
Sorry, I'll throw out the stupid pot.

804
01:04:50,460 --> 01:04:52,815
Right now I'd rather be dead.

805
01:04:54,140 --> 01:04:58,053
- Sorry. Let me help you.
- I'm fine, I can't fall any further.

806
01:04:58,620 --> 01:05:01,088
Sit on the sofa
and don't touch anything.

807
01:05:01,300 --> 01:05:03,655
I'll bring a fork for the cake.

808
01:05:14,580 --> 01:05:16,696
What are you doing here?

809
01:05:18,500 --> 01:05:21,970
- Did we have sex?
- You were sensational.

810
01:05:23,260 --> 01:05:25,137
Did I throw up on you?

811
01:05:26,140 --> 01:05:28,051
I've got good reflexes.

812
01:05:29,940 --> 01:05:33,728
No, we didn't have sex.
I would remember you.

813
01:05:35,340 --> 01:05:38,252
Go to sleep or you'll
feel like shit tomorrow.

814
01:05:40,180 --> 01:05:43,172
Don't you want
to take advantage of me?

815
01:05:44,700 --> 01:05:46,850
You don't like me, do you?

816
01:05:48,060 --> 01:05:50,779
- You are beautiful.
- I know.

817
01:05:51,540 --> 01:05:54,008
But you're in love with Dóra.

818
01:05:55,220 --> 01:05:58,735
- Nonsense.
- I agree, but it's still true.

819
01:05:59,820 --> 01:06:01,333
Who told you that?

820
01:06:02,140 --> 01:06:04,495
My age and my experience.

821
01:06:05,620 --> 01:06:08,851
She doesn't need a boyfriend,
just a sperm donor.

822
01:06:09,220 --> 01:06:12,849
She wants to get knocked up
and then ditch the guy.

823
01:06:19,020 --> 01:06:19,896
What?!

824
01:06:22,180 --> 01:06:25,889
I'm telling you.
She wants a child for herself.

825
01:06:29,340 --> 01:06:31,979
- Shall we dance?
- I never do.

826
01:06:32,220 --> 01:06:35,257
- Do you think I don't know how?
- I think I don't know.

827
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:38,658
Everybody can. As my father
used to say, all you need is

828
01:06:38,900 --> 01:06:41,653
two left feet and the tuition.
He was a dance teacher.

829
01:06:42,260 --> 01:06:47,015
Have you noticed that my elbow and
waist are at a 45 degree angle

830
01:06:47,180 --> 01:06:49,489
- when I eat?
- What is it for?

831
01:06:49,700 --> 01:06:53,978
No idea. It's uncomfortable and
I always spill something on myself.

832
01:06:55,100 --> 01:06:57,489
How about your parents?

833
01:06:59,260 --> 01:07:02,411
Anybody on the horizon?

834
01:07:02,660 --> 01:07:06,050
Not that we want to put
pressure on you, darling.

835
01:07:06,180 --> 01:07:09,013
You have a lot of time.

836
01:07:10,980 --> 01:07:15,053
You can wait with the children
after all.

837
01:07:16,900 --> 01:07:19,095
- Let's forget about it.
- Come.

838
01:07:19,500 --> 01:07:21,297
Let's dance.

839
01:07:24,180 --> 01:07:26,250
You can step on my toes.

840
01:07:34,780 --> 01:07:36,975
One-two-three...

841
01:07:38,180 --> 01:07:40,375
one-two-three...

842
01:07:53,660 --> 01:07:55,139
I am sorry.

843
01:07:56,100 --> 01:07:58,170
It was just a bit unexpected.

844
01:07:59,860 --> 01:08:02,454
And if I ask permission next time?

845
01:08:04,540 --> 01:08:06,417
It is too complicated.

846
01:08:07,740 --> 01:08:08,809
Alright.

847
01:08:11,100 --> 01:08:13,011
Are you going to call me?

848
01:08:13,980 --> 01:08:15,618
I'll call you.

849
01:08:38,140 --> 01:08:39,289
You?

850
01:08:55,260 --> 01:08:59,094
Is it true that all you want
is to get pregnant?

851
01:08:59,420 --> 01:09:03,208
- What?
- You only want to get pregnant.

852
01:09:04,500 --> 01:09:06,013
True or false?

853
01:09:07,860 --> 01:09:10,055
It's not that simple.

854
01:09:13,340 --> 01:09:15,900
I can't fucking believe it!

855
01:09:16,940 --> 01:09:21,252
- You wouldn't understand.
- Are you playing games with me?

856
01:09:22,380 --> 01:09:24,371
I'm not playing games.

857
01:09:24,580 --> 01:09:27,697
Nothing outside the bed, just a kid!
Are you nuts?

858
01:09:27,860 --> 01:09:30,454
- How about you?!
- Me?!

859
01:09:31,300 --> 01:09:34,337
It wasn't me who screwed
half the country!

860
01:09:35,340 --> 01:09:38,252
Listen to her!
So chaste all of a sudden!

861
01:09:41,260 --> 01:09:43,137
What a fucking bitch you are!

862
01:09:53,700 --> 01:09:55,611
Tamás! Tamás!

863
01:10:03,380 --> 01:10:07,259
Farewell to our sister Dóra.

864
01:10:07,740 --> 01:10:11,779
Let's hope her soul ascends to
Heaven and she finds things to read.

865
01:10:12,460 --> 01:10:16,897
She was the love of my life.
Had she not wanted just my sperm,

866
01:10:17,180 --> 01:10:20,968
I might have never taken
the vow of celibacy.

867
01:10:21,620 --> 01:10:24,817
She was killed by cowardice
and chocolate,

868
01:10:25,500 --> 01:10:27,650
let her rest in peace.

869
01:10:28,380 --> 01:10:33,170
And now, let us listen to the
Ave Maria in Dóra's performance.

870
01:10:43,420 --> 01:10:46,173
Listen, Sárffy!
Drag your ass to rehearsal,

871
01:10:46,300 --> 01:10:49,292
I'm fucking mad at you.
Full dress rehearsal is tomorrow.

872
01:10:49,500 --> 01:10:52,014
I don't care if you are giving
birth or whatever,

873
01:10:52,220 --> 01:10:54,859
just get your ass in here.
It's me, Paskó.

874
01:11:01,300 --> 01:11:04,019
- I think it's him.
- Yeah.

875
01:11:06,140 --> 01:11:08,495
I'm sure that's him.

876
01:11:13,220 --> 01:11:15,495
So cute.

877
01:11:15,700 --> 01:11:17,656
Ask him!

878
01:11:21,780 --> 01:11:24,692
Is it you in that TV commercial?

879
01:11:28,100 --> 01:11:29,135
No.

880
01:11:29,580 --> 01:11:31,172
Sure?

881
01:11:32,140 --> 01:11:33,539
Sure.

882
01:11:38,500 --> 01:11:43,210
I beg you to keep a vow
of silence about this subject.

883
01:11:46,180 --> 01:11:48,330
Good bye!

884
01:11:50,580 --> 01:11:53,697
- Azolan!
- Yes, my lord!

885
01:11:54,300 --> 01:11:56,131
High school students.

886
01:11:56,420 --> 01:11:58,456
- They neigh like cows.
- Horses.

887
01:11:58,700 --> 01:12:01,533
Same thing.
Szatmári is totally out of it.

888
01:12:03,260 --> 01:12:04,693
I'm leaving.

889
01:12:05,180 --> 01:12:07,819
Where are you travelling, my lord?

890
01:12:11,540 --> 01:12:12,655
Paris!

891
01:12:13,780 --> 01:12:15,372
To Paris?

892
01:12:20,020 --> 01:12:22,409
I know that you are going to Paris!

893
01:12:29,220 --> 01:12:31,780
Yes, yes, Paris.

894
01:12:32,580 --> 01:12:35,970
- So, get me my hat!
- Hat?

895
01:12:38,340 --> 01:12:41,093
- My hat and my gown!
- The hat and the gown!

896
01:12:41,300 --> 01:12:43,734
- My hat and my gown!
- Yes, my lord!

897
01:12:44,060 --> 01:12:45,891
Curtain! Curtain!

898
01:12:46,220 --> 01:12:47,972
Shit, man! Shit!

899
01:12:48,300 --> 01:12:50,336
Look who is here!

900
01:12:50,740 --> 01:12:53,538
Call up Kerekes, tell him
to start learning the lines.

901
01:12:53,740 --> 01:12:55,935
I may have to replace Szatmári.
Shut up!

902
01:12:57,260 --> 01:13:01,219
I kick his fucking ass!

903
01:13:12,100 --> 01:13:16,013
What the hell was that? You were
better on the first read through.

904
01:13:16,100 --> 01:13:19,775
You don't care? Learn your
lines or I'll have you replaced.

905
01:13:20,020 --> 01:13:20,930
Go ahead.

906
01:13:21,860 --> 01:13:24,693
What is it? A chick, right?

907
01:13:26,020 --> 01:13:28,693
Believe me, no woman is worth it.

908
01:13:29,420 --> 01:13:31,980
Alright, maybe two together.
If they're twins.

909
01:13:32,140 --> 01:13:34,495
- And sixteen years old.
- I'm not in love.

910
01:13:34,660 --> 01:13:37,333
Yeah, sure.
And I'm not a genius.

911
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:39,331
Alright, I'll take care of it.

912
01:13:43,980 --> 01:13:46,733
What are you staring at?
Get lost.

913
01:13:47,140 --> 01:13:49,654
Come, baby, you were great.

914
01:13:52,860 --> 01:13:54,054
Hi,

915
01:13:54,620 --> 01:13:56,212
how are you?

916
01:13:57,740 --> 01:13:58,809
Wait!

917
01:13:59,900 --> 01:14:02,016
This will help you relax.

918
01:14:03,060 --> 01:14:05,415
- Not now, thanks.
- Okay.

919
01:14:05,580 --> 01:14:08,538
Can I use your shower?
There is no hot water in mine.

920
01:14:08,660 --> 01:14:10,571
They're fixing the pipe.

921
01:14:12,460 --> 01:14:13,529
Thanks.

922
01:14:17,700 --> 01:14:20,533
Tomi, would you bring me the towel?

923
01:14:33,220 --> 01:14:34,494
Finally!

924
01:14:34,980 --> 01:14:37,175
- They told me you were here.
- I was ill.

925
01:14:37,340 --> 01:14:39,854
I've tried to call you.
I was worried.

926
01:14:40,100 --> 01:14:42,091
I know, I'm sorry.

927
01:14:42,540 --> 01:14:44,337
We should talk.

928
01:14:45,500 --> 01:14:47,297
Another time.

929
01:14:47,980 --> 01:14:50,414
- It's important.
- Not now.

930
01:15:02,340 --> 01:15:03,739
Tamás?!

931
01:15:12,220 --> 01:15:14,290
What are you doing here?

932
01:15:14,420 --> 01:15:15,455
It's just...

933
01:15:17,180 --> 01:15:19,296
That's not what I wanted.

934
01:15:24,140 --> 01:15:26,859
Do you know what you want?

935
01:15:27,620 --> 01:15:29,736
I should, shouldn't I?

936
01:15:48,980 --> 01:15:51,289
You took a shower in your costume?

937
01:15:52,620 --> 01:15:56,010
Aren't you hungry? Let's go
to the cafeteria. I'm starving.

938
01:15:56,380 --> 01:16:01,056
- Don't you turn it off? - The tap
is broken, it'll stop by itself.

939
01:16:02,220 --> 01:16:04,097
Tomi, are you coming?

940
01:16:05,060 --> 01:16:07,016
Who is that?

941
01:16:07,540 --> 01:16:12,216
The plumber... a woman.
The plumber woman is inside.

942
01:16:12,740 --> 01:16:15,049
Tomi, I'm freezing...

943
01:16:24,900 --> 01:16:27,050
We broke up, right?

944
01:16:29,820 --> 01:16:34,211
I don't want to beat around the bush.
Tamás told me about this child thing.

945
01:16:34,900 --> 01:16:36,333
I'm sorry.

946
01:16:36,900 --> 01:16:39,698
I want one, too. With you.

947
01:16:40,860 --> 01:16:43,977
I know it's kind of sudden.
I'm going to Canada

948
01:16:44,100 --> 01:16:46,330
after the premiere for two months.

949
01:16:46,500 --> 01:16:49,139
- You can't possibly want me.
- Why not?

950
01:16:49,300 --> 01:16:51,211
You're beautiful, bright,

951
01:16:51,540 --> 01:16:54,577
although you could use
a few dance lessons.

952
01:16:54,820 --> 01:16:57,618
Don't tell me you love me.

953
01:16:59,740 --> 01:17:01,696
I know what's wrong.

954
01:17:02,100 --> 01:17:06,013
You're afraid you're going to fall
in love then lose again.

955
01:17:06,540 --> 01:17:10,328
Same here.
But things change.

956
01:17:10,700 --> 01:17:15,091
- I don't need a father. - How do you
want to raise a child alone?

957
01:17:15,300 --> 01:17:16,574
That's my problem.

958
01:17:16,860 --> 01:17:18,771
Think about it.

959
01:17:19,100 --> 01:17:23,935
You can rely on me,
I can teach the kid to play soccer.

960
01:17:24,540 --> 01:17:26,815
I can use my two left feet.

961
01:17:28,980 --> 01:17:31,130
But, how do you mean to do it?

962
01:17:33,300 --> 01:17:35,211
I could marry you.

963
01:17:36,220 --> 01:17:38,780
I think we would get along well.

964
01:17:39,980 --> 01:17:41,971
Very well.

965
01:17:46,380 --> 01:17:49,019
I don't know what to say.

966
01:17:49,420 --> 01:17:51,172
Say yes.

967
01:17:51,940 --> 01:17:55,012
I can't believe this. I just
can't believe that you love him.

968
01:17:55,380 --> 01:17:59,134
- This is not about romantic love.
- And how about Szatmári?

969
01:17:59,300 --> 01:18:02,929
- He'll be fine with ten other women.
- You're so stupid!

970
01:18:03,140 --> 01:18:06,928
I'll have a child with a
good father who won't let me down.

971
01:18:07,220 --> 01:18:11,054
- You said you didn't want a father.
- Not someone like Szatmári.

972
01:18:11,220 --> 01:18:14,849
- You think you'll be happy?
- At least I won't get an ulcer.

973
01:18:14,980 --> 01:18:18,290
- What do you think?
- This is not that kind of wedding.

974
01:18:18,700 --> 01:18:21,453
- No big deal.
- You can't miss this opportunity.

975
01:18:21,700 --> 01:18:24,772
- Sorry, I got held up... Sárffy!
- Hi.

976
01:18:24,900 --> 01:18:28,051
- Is this the girlfriend who is
getting married? - Yes.

977
01:18:28,220 --> 01:18:31,690
- Could you show her something sexy?
- Sure. How are the kids doing?

978
01:18:31,900 --> 01:18:35,131
Fine. All six of them. Five...

979
01:18:35,340 --> 01:18:39,618
- I see. I'll show you a few pieces.
- Never mind.

980
01:18:47,460 --> 01:18:49,371
Makai is here!

981
01:18:49,700 --> 01:18:53,249
- I saw him. I'm sure it's him!
- Relax, forget about him now!

982
01:18:54,340 --> 01:18:55,773
The bastard.

983
01:18:57,140 --> 01:19:00,974
- He wanted me to beg him.
- Did you beg him?

984
01:19:04,620 --> 01:19:06,417
Do I look beautiful?

985
01:19:09,140 --> 01:19:11,335
I'm so damn tired.

986
01:19:15,340 --> 01:19:17,217
Relax, Sárffy!

987
01:19:18,780 --> 01:19:22,090
Why does the thought alarm you?
Alarm...

988
01:19:23,780 --> 01:19:26,214
Why does it alarm you?

989
01:19:27,340 --> 01:19:30,537
I know I've made
a fatal mistake...

990
01:19:30,780 --> 01:19:33,248
and you'll never forgive me.

991
01:19:35,660 --> 01:19:37,571
Listen to me!

992
01:19:38,580 --> 01:19:40,218
I love you,

993
01:19:41,220 --> 01:19:43,575
you cannot imagine how much.

994
01:19:45,300 --> 01:19:47,894
I want you to be happy,

995
01:19:48,500 --> 01:19:49,979
very happy.

996
01:19:50,660 --> 01:19:51,695
Don't!

997
01:19:53,180 --> 01:19:55,648
Why does the thought alarm you
that I could make you happy?

998
01:20:38,980 --> 01:20:40,572
You were great.

999
01:20:40,820 --> 01:20:43,493
You were divine! I knew it!
We'll get smashed after this.

1000
01:20:43,820 --> 01:20:45,936
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

1001
01:20:47,940 --> 01:20:50,329
- How was I?
- Pretty good.

1002
01:20:51,380 --> 01:20:53,450
Szatmári totally upstaged me.

1003
01:20:53,700 --> 01:20:56,419
I don't know,
I've been nervous all week.

1004
01:20:57,260 --> 01:21:00,172
Makai is here.
I know he'll come back crawling.

1005
01:21:01,180 --> 01:21:03,375
- Hi... Look who's here!
- Hi. Everything okay?

1006
01:21:03,780 --> 01:21:06,248
- I'm sorry, sir.
- Good evening.

1007
01:21:07,180 --> 01:21:09,171
You're amazing!

1008
01:21:10,700 --> 01:21:12,292
Listen, honey.

1009
01:21:12,620 --> 01:21:15,976
You were simply fantastic.
You were the best.

1010
01:21:16,180 --> 01:21:18,740
I can put you on the cover of
any magazine.

1011
01:21:22,540 --> 01:21:25,691
What's this bullshit
about your leaving?

1012
01:21:25,860 --> 01:21:29,250
It's true. Tomorrow morning.
For two months.

1013
01:21:29,420 --> 01:21:33,698
We'll do Othello in September.
Who'll tell us what it's about?

1014
01:21:33,900 --> 01:21:36,209
- You don't need me, genius.
- True.

1015
01:21:36,460 --> 01:21:40,738
You have to marry this nerdy
musician of all people.

1016
01:21:40,940 --> 01:21:44,979
- Aren't you sleeping with Szatmári?
- Even you don't know everything.

1017
01:21:45,300 --> 01:21:48,212
- Silly girl.
- Wicked bear.

1018
01:21:52,540 --> 01:21:55,418
- Did you see Zsófi?
- No, I didn't.

1019
01:21:59,780 --> 01:22:03,170
Excuse me. You'll drink this,
then...

1020
01:22:06,580 --> 01:22:09,652
- Margit, can I talk to you?
- Sure.

1021
01:22:10,100 --> 01:22:11,328
Hello.

1022
01:22:11,700 --> 01:22:15,852
First of all, I want to apologize.
I was such a jerk.

1023
01:22:16,060 --> 01:22:19,496
You're kind,
but this is a longer story.

1024
01:22:19,660 --> 01:22:22,618
- Not your fault.
- Nothing at all has happened.

1025
01:22:22,820 --> 01:22:24,651
We've made up.

1026
01:22:25,020 --> 01:22:29,650
- Really?! - Thirty years
is thirty years. You'll see.

1027
01:22:29,860 --> 01:22:31,737
- Shall we leave, honey?
- I'm ready.

1028
01:22:31,980 --> 01:22:34,289
- Goodbye, Dórika.
- Take care.

1029
01:22:35,900 --> 01:22:37,253
No kissing.

1030
01:22:39,460 --> 01:22:43,089
- Shall we leave?
- I want to say goodbye to Zsófi.

1031
01:22:43,340 --> 01:22:45,695
Alright, I'll wait outside.

1032
01:22:55,620 --> 01:22:59,818
Goddamn piece of shit!

1033
01:23:00,580 --> 01:23:03,572
Whoever invented this shit
should drop dead!

1034
01:23:04,860 --> 01:23:06,896
That was very impressive, bravo.

1035
01:23:07,060 --> 01:23:09,620
Jesus!
I thought I was by myself.

1036
01:23:09,820 --> 01:23:12,050
Did you see Zsófi?

1037
01:23:12,540 --> 01:23:16,294
I've been trying to call her
but this piece of junk died on me.

1038
01:23:26,620 --> 01:23:28,736
I won't return your call.

1039
01:23:29,020 --> 01:23:31,580
Someone should film my life story.

1040
01:23:32,420 --> 01:23:37,050
And thanks to all the guys and other
bacteria for their contribution.

1041
01:23:37,260 --> 01:23:38,773
My God!

1042
01:23:43,020 --> 01:23:44,339
Zsófi!

1043
01:23:48,020 --> 01:23:50,534
Wait, I have the key.

1044
01:24:27,900 --> 01:24:30,494
I haven't even congratulated you.

1045
01:24:31,780 --> 01:24:34,340
- You were very good.
- Thanks.

1046
01:24:36,300 --> 01:24:38,894
You don't have to go back
to Debrecen.

1047
01:24:39,300 --> 01:24:41,860
The director's wife
will be disappointed.

1048
01:24:44,220 --> 01:24:47,371
I don't think so.
She's the one who got me fired.

1049
01:24:47,820 --> 01:24:49,378
Are you serious?

1050
01:24:50,180 --> 01:24:55,049
Women can get crazy if you screw them
and even crazier if you don't.

1051
01:24:58,180 --> 01:25:00,011
What a jerk.

1052
01:25:00,460 --> 01:25:03,213
No, the jerks were those
who believed her.

1053
01:25:07,940 --> 01:25:11,694
You can go in.
She came to but she needs rest.

1054
01:25:12,780 --> 01:25:15,613
- Are you going to wait for me?
- Go ahead.

1055
01:25:34,740 --> 01:25:38,653
Did you tell them to shove
this big pipe down my throat?

1056
01:25:39,060 --> 01:25:41,176
You're such a pinhead.

1057
01:25:42,780 --> 01:25:44,293
I'm sorry.

1058
01:25:45,580 --> 01:25:46,933
Why did you do it?

1059
01:25:49,900 --> 01:25:52,653
I was the star of my high school.

1060
01:25:53,660 --> 01:25:55,969
Everyone wanted to bed me.

1061
01:25:58,300 --> 01:26:03,135
- And most of them did.
- You can have anyone you want.

1062
01:26:04,340 --> 01:26:07,935
- It's not the same. - You're
stupid. You are 34 years old.

1063
01:26:08,900 --> 01:26:11,130
33 and a half.

1064
01:26:12,820 --> 01:26:15,892
And I live alone with my vibrator.

1065
01:26:16,220 --> 01:26:17,892
For the time being.

1066
01:26:18,180 --> 01:26:20,978
I cannot even kill myself.

1067
01:26:23,260 --> 01:26:25,296
Do you want me to stay?

1068
01:26:26,020 --> 01:26:27,294
Just leave.

1069
01:26:30,540 --> 01:26:34,692
At least you have something going...
sort of.

1070
01:26:35,420 --> 01:26:38,378
Since you're leaving, can I use
your place for a while?

1071
01:26:38,540 --> 01:26:41,737
I don't want all the journalists
breaking down my door.

1072
01:26:41,900 --> 01:26:43,015
Sure.

1073
01:26:43,380 --> 01:26:45,098
Take a rest now.

1074
01:26:49,540 --> 01:26:51,292
- You?
- How is she?

1075
01:26:52,220 --> 01:26:54,814
- She will survive.
- Thank God.

1076
01:26:55,620 --> 01:26:56,735
Tamás?

1077
01:26:56,940 --> 01:26:59,693
- Went home.
- He said he'd wait for me.

1078
01:26:59,900 --> 01:27:01,811
Why should he?

1079
01:27:02,460 --> 01:27:04,098
Are you alright?

1080
01:27:06,100 --> 01:27:08,819
We'll have a cup of coffee
at the airport.

1081
01:27:09,340 --> 01:27:13,094
We'll have to get the luggage.
I don't want to miss the plane.

1082
01:27:22,180 --> 01:27:24,057
I'm not going.

1083
01:27:30,740 --> 01:27:35,018
You can come a couple of days later,
once Zsófi feels better.

1084
01:27:35,220 --> 01:27:38,018
It's not about Zsófi.

1085
01:27:39,100 --> 01:27:40,738
What?

1086
01:27:41,780 --> 01:27:44,692
I'm not going at all.

1087
01:27:47,860 --> 01:27:50,135
I see... It might have worked.

1088
01:27:51,700 --> 01:27:54,772
But that's not enough.

1089
01:27:55,700 --> 01:27:57,577
I'm sorry.

1090
01:28:12,100 --> 01:28:13,249
Bye.

1091
01:28:26,700 --> 01:28:29,612
- Good morning.
- Dalszínház Street, please.

1092
01:28:29,820 --> 01:28:32,334
- Are you in a hurry?
- Terribly.

1093
01:28:37,540 --> 01:28:39,178
Trouble?

1094
01:28:40,620 --> 01:28:43,054
- I'm in love!
- Trouble.

1095
01:29:07,180 --> 01:29:09,740
Shut her up!

1096
01:29:10,020 --> 01:29:14,457
<i>Happiness, time to come home</i>

1097
01:29:14,900 --> 01:29:19,212
<i>It is late, time to come home</i>

1098
01:29:19,780 --> 01:29:24,376
<i>Where you come from, I don't care.</i>

1099
01:29:25,060 --> 01:29:29,099
<i>Come right home, that is all</i>

1100
01:29:30,420 --> 01:29:33,651
- Are you coming downstairs?
- No way.

1101
01:29:34,940 --> 01:29:36,339
Your choice.

1102
01:29:41,980 --> 01:29:43,459
Sweetie!

1103
01:29:46,420 --> 01:29:48,490
You can come up to me!

1104
01:29:51,180 --> 01:29:54,331
I know. A Jehova's witness.

1105
01:29:56,020 --> 01:29:59,137
- I'm calling the police.
- I like it!

1106
01:30:05,580 --> 01:30:07,889
Finally! Give it to her!

1107
01:30:18,980 --> 01:30:22,450
- What are you doing?
- I'm serenading you.

1108
01:30:23,820 --> 01:30:25,936
I may have to move.

1109
01:30:26,140 --> 01:30:28,495
You can always move in with me.

1110
01:30:28,820 --> 01:30:30,173
And Péter?

1111
01:30:30,900 --> 01:30:32,811
On his way to Canada.

1112
01:30:41,380 --> 01:30:43,974
And what if I replace you
in two weeks?

1113
01:30:44,260 --> 01:30:47,172
You'll be sorry
for the rest of your life.

1114
01:31:58,980 --> 01:32:00,095
Thanks.

1115
01:32:01,300 --> 01:32:02,699
Damn!

1116
01:32:03,500 --> 01:32:04,649
Sorry.

1117
01:32:06,780 --> 01:32:08,691
I always do this.

1118
01:32:13,860 --> 01:32:17,330
Look here.
It's just like a tattoo.

1119
01:32:39,420 --> 01:32:40,819
What is this

1120
01:32:44,300 --> 01:32:45,619
There's cinnamon in it...

1121
01:32:45,820 --> 01:32:47,492
Cauliflower in yoghurt...

1122
01:32:48,980 --> 01:32:51,972
This is like beef stew,
delicious.

1123
01:32:53,820 --> 01:32:57,449
Tzatziki in yoghurt and...

1124
01:32:59,220 --> 01:33:03,736
Eggplant... yoghurt...
zucchini...

1125
01:33:21,620 --> 01:33:25,738
Get me Szatmáry... shit...
Markovits...

1126
01:33:27,380 --> 01:33:29,291
Take it...
You take it...

1127
01:33:31,620 --> 01:33:32,848
This rushing...

1128
01:33:33,060 --> 01:33:37,258
Why? My opinion doesn't...
isn't holy...

1129
01:33:37,620 --> 01:33:40,976
You'll be the first one I'll
lust after. Your tattooed butt...

1130
01:33:41,100 --> 01:33:42,818
- Stop it...
- Sweetie.

1131
01:33:42,940 --> 01:33:44,532
You are the sweetie.
And your mom...

1132
01:33:47,220 --> 01:33:48,892
<i>My mom is called sweetie!</i>

1133
01:33:49,100 --> 01:33:52,172
Since that ad came out,
everyone's been joking about my butt.

1134
01:33:52,340 --> 01:33:54,058
I can't date women any more.

1135
01:33:54,180 --> 01:33:57,297
Aren't we driving damn slowly?
Even the bicycles ride faster.

1136
01:33:57,500 --> 01:33:59,730
- Isn't this weird?
- Let's follow him...

1137
01:34:28,540 --> 01:34:32,579
Just sex and everything else?...
I mean...

1138
01:34:34,980 --> 01:34:37,255
You cannot imagine how much...

1139
01:34:38,380 --> 01:34:41,019
I want you to be happy...

1140
01:34:44,140 --> 01:34:47,257
I meant to say: Dóra I love you...
I don't love you, Saci...

1141
01:34:47,500 --> 01:34:51,618
I mean... I never loved Saci,
I have loved you...

1142
01:34:51,980 --> 01:34:52,696
Dóra...

1143
01:34:53,180 --> 01:34:54,329
I was going to say,

1144
01:34:55,220 --> 01:34:58,929
that I don't love Saci,
and not because I loved her...

1145
01:35:00,660 --> 01:35:04,130
<i>Come right home, that's all</i>
