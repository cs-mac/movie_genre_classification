1
00:00:08,562 --> 00:00:13,606
Eunsu's father is someone I know?

2
00:00:14,002 --> 00:00:15,064
Yes.

3
00:00:15,622 --> 00:00:17,633
Who is he?

4
00:00:21,412 --> 00:00:24,418
Whoever it is,

5
00:00:24,472 --> 00:00:28,488
you're saying this is all because of him?

6
00:00:28,632 --> 00:00:29,698
Yes.

7
00:00:33,712 --> 00:00:35,734
Just who is he...

8
00:00:43,832 --> 00:00:44,871
Mother...

9
00:00:50,402 --> 00:00:51,463
Hiding?

10
00:00:52,012 --> 00:00:53,097
What am I hiding?

11
00:00:54,872 --> 00:00:56,887
Why is your mother meeting Hyeondo?

12
00:00:57,022 --> 00:00:59,121
What is she going to tell him?

13
00:01:01,172 --> 00:01:04,174
- Mother! / - Mr. Jang Taesu...

14
00:01:07,172 --> 00:01:08,253
Your father.

15
00:01:12,352 --> 00:01:13,401
Eunsu?

16
00:01:13,842 --> 00:01:14,850
Is Eunsu my daughter?

17
00:01:17,922 --> 00:01:19,963
Talk about insolence!

18
00:01:20,792 --> 00:01:23,821
If you weren't Sangjun's son, I would...

19
00:01:27,592 --> 00:01:30,678
Are you saying this is a misunderstanding?

20
00:01:31,452 --> 00:01:32,549
Misunderstanding?

21
00:01:33,422 --> 00:01:34,485
Out of nowhere, your family

22
00:01:35,052 --> 00:01:36,099
drew this conclusion without my knowledge,

23
00:01:36,522 --> 00:01:37,558
and now you want me to answer

24
00:01:37,882 --> 00:01:39,903
this ludicrous question?

25
00:01:40,092 --> 00:01:41,098
Just how big of an idiot did you think I was

26
00:01:41,692 --> 00:01:42,760
to ask me such a thing!

27
00:01:46,872 --> 00:01:47,918
Get out right now.

28
00:01:48,332 --> 00:01:49,373
I said get out!

29
00:01:50,492 --> 00:01:51,539
What about my father?

30
00:01:53,492 --> 00:01:55,533
Did he tell you that himself?

31
00:01:58,442 --> 00:02:00,513
Did he

32
00:02:02,452 --> 00:02:04,541
tell you Eunsu is his daughter?

33
00:02:18,962 --> 00:02:19,985
Hyeondo!

34
00:02:22,742 --> 00:02:25,790
What did you and my mom talk about?

35
00:02:33,232 --> 00:02:37,269
Your call is being forwarded to an automated...

36
00:02:38,972 --> 00:02:40,977
He should rush here, demanding my answer,

37
00:02:41,022 --> 00:02:42,093
but he won't even pick up his phone.

38
00:02:43,452 --> 00:02:46,550
How far is he trying to go with Han Eunsu?

39
00:02:47,432 --> 00:02:49,489
Your secretaries are out looking for them.

40
00:02:50,492 --> 00:02:54,507
Hyeondo and Eunsu, they're bad news.

41
00:03:12,712 --> 00:03:16,760
What did you talk about with my mom?

42
00:03:22,732 --> 00:03:25,733
Where are we going right now?

43
00:03:25,742 --> 00:03:26,807
We're running away.

44
00:03:28,762 --> 00:03:30,773
I'm kidnapping you.

45
00:03:31,672 --> 00:03:33,733
So don't feel badly about your mom.

46
00:03:59,232 --> 00:04:04,256
Your call is being forwarded to an automated...

47
00:04:09,762 --> 00:04:14,811
Your call is being forwarded to an automated...

48
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:18,940
Eunsu,

49
00:04:19,952 --> 00:04:21,957
I know you're having a hard time.

50
00:04:22,002 --> 00:04:24,045
But you need to talk to me.

51
00:04:24,432 --> 00:04:28,443
Call me when you get this, okay?

52
00:04:45,832 --> 00:04:48,883
So are we

53
00:04:49,342 --> 00:04:51,437
running away for the sake of love?

54
00:04:54,892 --> 00:04:55,966
I guess we are.

55
00:04:59,612 --> 00:05:06,615
So you're not willing to

56
00:05:06,912 --> 00:05:09,949
talk about it with me and try to resolve it?

57
00:05:14,002 --> 00:05:16,019
But then again,

58
00:05:16,172 --> 00:05:17,255
if you were willing to do that,

59
00:05:18,002 --> 00:05:20,069
you wouldn't run away like this.

60
00:05:26,122 --> 00:05:28,175
So where are we going?

61
00:05:28,652 --> 00:05:29,750
To an island of some sort?

62
00:05:31,262 --> 00:05:33,279
That'd be nice.

63
00:05:34,082 --> 00:05:37,085
I'll abandon my family,

64
00:05:38,002 --> 00:05:41,015
and you'll abandon yours.

65
00:05:41,972 --> 00:05:43,984
We'll see each other every day

66
00:05:44,092 --> 00:05:47,104
and talk about things we couldn't talk about.

67
00:05:49,982 --> 00:05:55,047
Are you sure we'd be happy that way?

68
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:18,025
Jiwan, it's you.

69
00:06:19,102 --> 00:06:20,163
I'm home, grandma.

70
00:06:22,002 --> 00:06:23,010
Where's mom?

71
00:06:23,802 --> 00:06:24,857
She's in her room.

72
00:06:25,352 --> 00:06:29,370
She won't eat, talk to me or come out.

73
00:06:29,532 --> 00:06:31,587
Something must have happened.

74
00:06:32,082 --> 00:06:33,168
Do you know anything about this?

75
00:06:34,592 --> 00:06:35,620
I'll go in and talk to her.

76
00:06:35,872 --> 00:06:36,933
Don't worry, grandma.

77
00:06:57,592 --> 00:06:58,646
Jiwan.

78
00:06:59,702 --> 00:07:02,795
Eunsu, I can't reach Eunsu.

79
00:07:03,632 --> 00:07:06,671
I think Hyeondo and Eunsu are together,

80
00:07:07,022 --> 00:07:11,053
and if Hyeondo says anything to her,

81
00:07:11,332 --> 00:07:12,354
if he does...

82
00:07:12,552 --> 00:07:14,552
Calm down, mother.

83
00:07:14,892 --> 00:07:15,983
We shouldn't be sitting idly by like this.

84
00:07:16,802 --> 00:07:17,858
Jiwan, why don't you call Eunsu...

85
00:07:18,362 --> 00:07:19,414
Mother.

86
00:07:21,042 --> 00:07:25,089
Listen to me carefully.

87
00:07:28,832 --> 00:07:31,918
I just talked to Mr. Jang Taesu.

88
00:07:37,602 --> 00:07:38,696
Eunsu...

89
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:45,037
Eunsu isn't Mr. Jang's daughter.

90
00:07:50,312 --> 00:07:51,399
Jiwan...

91
00:07:55,032 --> 00:07:57,038
What are you saying?

92
00:08:04,562 --> 00:08:05,659
Look at this.

93
00:08:15,572 --> 00:08:18,577
This is your dad's passport.

94
00:08:19,072 --> 00:08:22,097
When Ms. Lee Jeongae was pregnant with Eunsu,

95
00:08:22,322 --> 00:08:26,390
Mr. Jang and father were overseas in China.

96
00:08:31,542 --> 00:08:33,546
Jiwan...

97
00:08:33,582 --> 00:08:36,582
I don't know why,

98
00:08:37,942 --> 00:08:40,957
but I think Ms. Lee lied to you.

99
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:06,584
Your call is being forwarded to an automated...

100
00:09:25,452 --> 00:09:28,470
Your call is being forwarded to an automated...

101
00:09:28,992 --> 00:09:30,069
Jeongae...

102
00:09:30,762 --> 00:09:33,789
Why would Jeongae tell me such a lie?

103
00:09:36,132 --> 00:09:41,160
Jang Taesu, he said she isn't her daughter?

104
00:09:41,412 --> 00:09:42,475
Yes.

105
00:09:43,042 --> 00:09:44,135
Mr. Jang said she wasn't.

106
00:09:45,702 --> 00:09:47,758
Those were his exact words?

107
00:09:49,032 --> 00:09:50,073
Yes.

108
00:10:19,492 --> 00:10:22,536
My mom, Jiwan,

109
00:10:22,932 --> 00:10:26,097
my grandmother and my aunt

110
00:10:26,097 --> 00:10:29,262
must be really worried.

111
00:10:34,002 --> 00:10:40,051
Can my family live without me?

112
00:10:46,422 --> 00:10:47,513
Hyeondo, how about you?

113
00:10:51,842 --> 00:10:55,881
Can you live without your family?

114
00:11:02,542 --> 00:11:03,626
How cruel you are, Han Eunsu.

115
00:11:07,482 --> 00:11:08,491
You're making it impossible for us to run away.

116
00:11:21,262 --> 00:11:23,291
You're home?

117
00:11:24,372 --> 00:11:26,444
Hyeondo isn't home, is he?

118
00:11:27,952 --> 00:11:30,036
No, he's not. Why are you asking?

119
00:11:30,792 --> 00:11:32,858
He's with Eunsu right now.

120
00:11:33,452 --> 00:11:34,494
What?

121
00:11:34,872 --> 00:11:35,940
Han Eunsu?

122
00:11:37,182 --> 00:11:38,193
That idiot!

123
00:11:38,292 --> 00:11:40,331
That's no use. He won't pick up.

124
00:11:41,822 --> 00:11:43,823
What do you do all day at home?

125
00:11:43,922 --> 00:11:45,007
Why did you let him go around doing this?

126
00:11:45,772 --> 00:11:48,849
I can't control his private life.

127
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:52,584
You shouldn't have let things get this far!

128
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:55,029
You really think I did nothing?

129
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:57,724
I've been busy, too.

130
00:11:59,192 --> 00:12:01,270
I'm not letting him get away with this.

131
00:12:01,972 --> 00:12:03,010
Mark my words!

132
00:12:03,352 --> 00:12:04,445
Do whatever you want!

133
00:12:07,252 --> 00:12:08,328
That jerk!

134
00:12:09,352 --> 00:12:12,354
What's he doing with Han Eunsu?

135
00:12:23,682 --> 00:12:25,687
What's your blood type?

136
00:12:28,332 --> 00:12:29,400
I'm A.

137
00:12:31,672 --> 00:12:32,765
You can tell I'm A, can't you?

138
00:12:34,442 --> 00:12:36,442
I'm B.

139
00:12:37,752 --> 00:12:39,756
Oh, a type B man.

140
00:12:39,792 --> 00:12:40,796
Very attractive.

141
00:12:41,192 --> 00:12:43,211
You can't get enough of me, right?

142
00:12:45,502 --> 00:12:46,580
What's your favorite season?

143
00:12:49,812 --> 00:12:51,837
Summer.

144
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:53,159
I can't stand cold weather.

145
00:12:55,502 --> 00:12:58,551
I can't stand the heat, so I like winter.

146
00:13:00,272 --> 00:13:01,356
How come we're so different?

147
00:13:07,492 --> 00:13:09,506
So?

148
00:13:09,632 --> 00:13:10,704
You're turned off?

149
00:13:12,122 --> 00:13:15,187
So I'm turned on.

150
00:13:25,222 --> 00:13:27,245
What is it?

151
00:13:28,152 --> 00:13:30,223
You're not going to tell me?

152
00:13:34,372 --> 00:13:35,467
For a split second,

153
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:39,536
I thought something was really weird,

154
00:13:41,922 --> 00:13:44,925
but I don't think it's right.

155
00:13:48,102 --> 00:13:49,178
It just doesn't make any sense.

156
00:13:50,952 --> 00:13:52,046
Mr. Jang Hyeondo.

157
00:13:52,892 --> 00:13:57,968
Yes, I'm Jang Hyeondo and you're Han Eunsu.

158
00:14:01,262 --> 00:14:03,306
Nothing will change.

159
00:14:50,322 --> 00:14:53,420
Are you still waiting for Ms. Lee to call?

160
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:56,439
Why don't you get some sleep?

161
00:14:57,222 --> 00:14:59,223
You can go see her tomorrow.

162
00:15:01,682 --> 00:15:03,751
I'm not waiting for her call.

163
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:07,436
Eunsu hasn't called me yet.

164
00:15:09,352 --> 00:15:11,438
What if she finds out

165
00:15:12,212 --> 00:15:15,230
she has a birth mom from Hyeondo?

166
00:15:15,392 --> 00:15:17,400
Mother,

167
00:15:17,472 --> 00:15:21,478
you're Eunsu's mom and my mother.

168
00:15:21,532 --> 00:15:24,555
Nothing's going to change that.

169
00:15:29,172 --> 00:15:30,270
And Hyeondo

170
00:15:31,152 --> 00:15:33,241
isn't that thoughtless.

171
00:15:34,482 --> 00:15:39,511
He wouldn't say anything that'd hurt Eunsu.

172
00:15:40,702 --> 00:15:42,779
So get some sleep, mother.

173
00:15:47,172 --> 00:15:50,189
You, too. You have work in the morning.

174
00:15:52,752 --> 00:15:53,798
Okay.

175
00:17:23,232 --> 00:17:25,310
What were you going to do to a sleeping girl?

176
00:17:26,012 --> 00:17:28,034
You were pretending?

177
00:17:28,232 --> 00:17:30,314
Wow, talk about being coy.

178
00:17:31,052 --> 00:17:32,091
A coy woman is...

179
00:17:32,442 --> 00:17:33,486
Not attractive?

180
00:17:33,882 --> 00:17:35,890
So very attractive.

181
00:17:36,322 --> 00:17:37,399
How did you know I love coy women?

182
00:17:38,092 --> 00:17:39,174
What are you trying to do with me?

183
00:17:39,912 --> 00:17:41,917
You're such a player.

184
00:17:47,812 --> 00:17:48,877
Han Eunsu.

185
00:17:50,362 --> 00:17:52,381
Yes, Mr. Jang Hyeondo?

186
00:17:53,792 --> 00:17:54,887
Eunsu.

187
00:17:56,182 --> 00:17:57,260
What is it?

188
00:17:59,392 --> 00:18:02,398
You seem to love my name too much.

189
00:18:11,102 --> 00:18:12,176
Hyeondo.

190
00:18:13,912 --> 00:18:14,915
Yes?

191
00:18:18,572 --> 00:18:19,653
Let's go home now.

192
00:18:24,012 --> 00:18:30,013
I'm mad at my mom and Jiwan,

193
00:18:30,022 --> 00:18:37,073
so I want to leave them, but...

194
00:18:37,532 --> 00:18:40,541
I think I'll end up regretting it.

195
00:18:46,622 --> 00:18:48,676
You can't leave them?

196
00:18:53,582 --> 00:18:56,641
If you can't leave them,

197
00:18:57,172 --> 00:18:59,249
you must live with them.

198
00:19:01,322 --> 00:19:03,329
Let's try to get through it.

199
00:19:04,022 --> 00:19:06,030
Whatever awaits

200
00:19:06,102 --> 00:19:09,151
in our future,

201
00:19:10,142 --> 00:19:11,214
I can't wait to find out.

202
00:19:14,702 --> 00:19:18,731
You keep saying things I can't understand.

203
00:19:20,102 --> 00:19:22,148
What are you hiding from me?

204
00:19:22,562 --> 00:19:24,647
You couldn't even begin to imagine.

205
00:19:25,412 --> 00:19:28,419
You have no sense of loyalty.

206
00:19:41,592 --> 00:19:42,599
Yes, Seonhui, I'm on my way.

207
00:19:43,292 --> 00:19:44,359
I'll be there shortly.

208
00:19:48,012 --> 00:19:49,063
Step on it.

209
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:50,546
Yes, sir.

210
00:19:53,822 --> 00:19:58,881
You remember about what happened back then.

211
00:19:59,412 --> 00:20:01,456
Back then?

212
00:20:01,852 --> 00:20:04,857
Around the time Jiwan's mother passed away.

213
00:20:04,902 --> 00:20:08,945
I didn't stay in touch, so I don't know much.

214
00:20:09,332 --> 00:20:14,351
Sangjun was in China for six months on business.

215
00:20:15,792 --> 00:20:21,811
Do you remember about that time?

216
00:20:23,762 --> 00:20:27,780
Your call is being forwarded to an automated...

217
00:20:27,942 --> 00:20:30,019
Jeongae, pick up the phone.

218
00:20:30,712 --> 00:20:32,787
I need to see you right now.

219
00:20:33,462 --> 00:20:35,476
Pick up the phone!

220
00:20:51,652 --> 00:20:52,658
Jeongae?

221
00:20:53,822 --> 00:20:55,859
I think she might have moved back

222
00:20:56,192 --> 00:20:58,236
to where she lived before she went to America.

223
00:20:59,082 --> 00:21:00,124
I'm not sure.

224
00:21:00,502 --> 00:21:03,538
I haven't talked to her much these days.

225
00:21:03,862 --> 00:21:06,936
She might come for Eunha.

226
00:21:09,452 --> 00:21:10,537
Eunha?

227
00:21:11,302 --> 00:21:12,349
Will she be here on her birthday?

228
00:21:12,772 --> 00:21:12,868
When is it?

229
00:21:13,732 --> 00:21:14,827
No.

230
00:21:15,682 --> 00:21:18,688
Eunha's birthday has passed already.

231
00:21:20,472 --> 00:21:24,489
Is Eunha one of the kids Jeongae is sponsoring?

232
00:21:24,642 --> 00:21:28,693
Well, something like that.

233
00:21:34,472 --> 00:21:36,495
Thank you.

234
00:21:57,432 --> 00:22:01,451
You have five new messages.

235
00:22:02,302 --> 00:22:04,310
Jeongae, it's me.

236
00:22:04,382 --> 00:22:06,437
Seonhui was just here.

237
00:22:06,932 --> 00:22:10,963
Did you tell Seonhui about the child?

238
00:22:11,242 --> 00:22:15,269
Call Seonhui when you hear this.

239
00:22:15,512 --> 00:22:17,521
She needs to see you urgently.

240
00:22:18,412 --> 00:22:20,454
Jeongae, pick up the phone.

241
00:22:20,832 --> 00:22:22,835
I need to see you right now.

242
00:23:16,512 --> 00:23:17,611
You are unbelievable.

243
00:23:18,502 --> 00:23:19,507
What's so urgent that you're running

244
00:23:20,002 --> 00:23:23,043
around like a chicken with its head cut off?

245
00:23:25,712 --> 00:23:26,759
What?

246
00:23:27,182 --> 00:23:28,251
What is it this time?

247
00:23:28,872 --> 00:23:30,966
Do you know how offensive that look is?

248
00:23:31,812 --> 00:23:32,837
If you're going to start preaching

249
00:23:33,062 --> 00:23:35,113
to me about how to live my life, just go.

250
00:23:36,652 --> 00:23:37,689
Jeongae.

251
00:23:38,022 --> 00:23:39,055
What?

252
00:23:40,332 --> 00:23:41,340
Back then,

253
00:23:43,622 --> 00:23:44,705
why did you chase after Taesu?

254
00:23:45,452 --> 00:23:47,507
Knowing people were gossiping about you?

255
00:23:48,382 --> 00:23:51,427
Because I was pregnant with his baby!

256
00:23:52,942 --> 00:23:57,942
Is Eunsu really Taesu's daughter?

257
00:23:59,312 --> 00:24:01,336
Oh, you're driving me nuts.

258
00:24:02,802 --> 00:24:04,806
How many times must you ask me?

259
00:24:06,962 --> 00:24:07,969
Is it true?

260
00:24:08,662 --> 00:24:09,736
How annoying!

261
00:24:10,932 --> 00:24:12,970
Are you going deaf or something?

262
00:24:13,852 --> 00:24:16,866
Yes, it's true.

263
00:24:16,992 --> 00:24:20,044
Eunsu is Mr. Jang Taesu's daughter!

264
00:24:27,572 --> 00:24:30,649
Seonhui, are you crazy?

265
00:24:32,242 --> 00:24:35,250
How could you tell such a lie?

266
00:24:35,322 --> 00:24:36,383
Of all things, how could you

267
00:24:36,932 --> 00:24:40,006
lie about who the father of your child is?

268
00:24:40,672 --> 00:24:42,686
I'm not lying!

269
00:24:54,952 --> 00:24:56,964
That's Sangjun's passport.

270
00:24:58,052 --> 00:24:59,130
Sangjun and Taesu

271
00:24:59,832 --> 00:25:02,895
left Korea together and came back together.

272
00:25:04,172 --> 00:25:06,174
When you got pregnant with Eunsu,

273
00:25:06,372 --> 00:25:09,373
Taesu wasn't even in Korea.

274
00:25:12,602 --> 00:25:14,627
Why did you do it?

275
00:25:15,482 --> 00:25:18,499
Why did you tell me such a lie?

276
00:25:18,652 --> 00:25:20,657
Why are you making such a fuss over that?

277
00:25:20,702 --> 00:25:22,771
I did it because I knew you'd bother me!

278
00:25:25,502 --> 00:25:26,541
What?

279
00:25:26,892 --> 00:25:27,948
Don't you see?

280
00:25:28,452 --> 00:25:29,463
Sugyeong was going crazy,

281
00:25:29,562 --> 00:25:31,571
and you flipped out on me, too!

282
00:25:32,572 --> 00:25:35,575
You heard the rumor and jumped to conclusions.

283
00:25:35,872 --> 00:25:38,167
Had I told you it was someone else's,

284
00:25:38,167 --> 00:25:40,462
you would've pestered me more.

285
00:25:40,462 --> 00:25:41,556
So I didn't correct you.

286
00:25:42,752 --> 00:25:43,795
I mean,

287
00:25:44,912 --> 00:25:46,954
who cares who the father is?

288
00:25:47,332 --> 00:25:51,384
You're worried about who the father is?

289
00:25:51,852 --> 00:25:53,943
You're offended now that it's not Taesu?

290
00:25:55,212 --> 00:25:56,270
Don't worry.

291
00:25:56,792 --> 00:25:57,835
Her father wasn't a bad guy.

292
00:25:58,222 --> 00:26:00,255
I have standards, you know?

293
00:26:03,032 --> 00:26:06,055
You lied to me because I might pester you?

294
00:26:06,262 --> 00:26:09,319
That was the reason?

295
00:26:09,832 --> 00:26:11,833
What else could it be?

296
00:26:11,842 --> 00:26:13,914
Must I have some other grand reason?

297
00:26:16,702 --> 00:26:18,729
Of course you do!

298
00:26:18,972 --> 00:26:20,029
Maybe someone's life was at risk

299
00:26:20,542 --> 00:26:21,597
or maybe it was for Eunsu's sake!

300
00:26:22,092 --> 00:26:24,113
You have to have some grand reason!

301
00:26:24,302 --> 00:26:26,357
Or else, I!

302
00:26:26,852 --> 00:26:27,909
Jeongae!

303
00:26:28,422 --> 00:26:32,449
Because of your lie, I've worried about her

304
00:26:32,692 --> 00:26:34,726
dad coming and taking her away all my life.

305
00:26:35,032 --> 00:26:37,065
I was scared to death about Eunsu finding out

306
00:26:37,362 --> 00:26:39,377
and being hurt by it, or my mother or Jiwan

307
00:26:39,512 --> 00:26:40,546
finding out.

308
00:26:40,852 --> 00:26:44,855
I had to avoid Taesu and all my old friends!

309
00:26:46,412 --> 00:26:47,504
I would've told my mother the truth

310
00:26:48,332 --> 00:26:50,403
had I known Taesu wasn't her father!

311
00:26:51,042 --> 00:26:53,051
I didn't ask you to live that way!

312
00:26:53,132 --> 00:26:54,225
Over some silly little girl.

313
00:26:55,062 --> 00:26:57,097
How dare you call her a silly little girl!

314
00:26:58,202 --> 00:27:03,208
To me, she's the most precious daughter.

315
00:27:03,262 --> 00:27:05,263
It breaks my heart to see

316
00:27:05,362 --> 00:27:07,363
her the least bit hurt.

317
00:27:07,462 --> 00:27:07,544
And because of you,

318
00:27:08,282 --> 00:27:11,286
I made my baby cry so many tears!

319
00:27:11,322 --> 00:27:14,387
I was heartless and cruel to her!

320
00:27:14,972 --> 00:27:15,994
I was afraid Eunsu would

321
00:27:16,192 --> 00:27:17,273
become hopeful if I softened up,

322
00:27:18,002 --> 00:27:20,078
so I was harsher and meaner to her!

323
00:27:20,762 --> 00:27:21,814
I had to break my own baby's heart, because

324
00:27:22,282 --> 00:27:23,324
I thought that would prevent more heartaches.

325
00:27:23,702 --> 00:27:24,734
Do you know how I felt,

326
00:27:25,022 --> 00:27:27,120
doing all those horrible things to Eunsu?

327
00:27:29,332 --> 00:27:31,406
What are you talking about?

328
00:27:35,212 --> 00:27:40,226
You don't deserve to be Eunsu's mom.

329
00:27:40,352 --> 00:27:41,439
Oh, boy.

330
00:27:43,712 --> 00:27:48,786
I never want to see you again, Jeongae.

331
00:27:49,452 --> 00:27:53,455
Don't come see Eunsu ever again.

332
00:27:53,482 --> 00:27:55,514
As if I would care!

333
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:58,189
Right.

334
00:27:59,062 --> 00:28:05,075
That's the way you've always been.

335
00:29:24,412 --> 00:29:25,454
Eunsu.

336
00:29:29,072 --> 00:29:30,130
Eunsu!

337
00:29:31,282 --> 00:29:32,350
Why are you here?

338
00:29:32,962 --> 00:29:34,964
What more do you have to say?

339
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:36,919
I have nothing to say to you.

340
00:29:37,342 --> 00:29:39,351
I'm sorry.

341
00:29:42,142 --> 00:29:47,198
To both you and Hyeondo,

342
00:29:47,702 --> 00:29:48,709
what I did was wrong.

343
00:29:50,902 --> 00:29:52,996
I know I did something I shouldn't have.

344
00:29:57,042 --> 00:30:00,083
I know he's the man you love.

345
00:30:01,942 --> 00:30:04,021
I know he's very dear to you.

346
00:30:05,882 --> 00:30:07,976
And I know you're the only one he loves.

347
00:30:11,252 --> 00:30:13,253
I'm sorry, Eunsu.

348
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:16,818
I shouldn't have done those things

349
00:30:17,412 --> 00:30:19,414
to you or Hyeondo.

350
00:30:20,022 --> 00:30:21,097
Do you mean it?

351
00:30:23,672 --> 00:30:26,769
You won't scream or get mad at me

352
00:30:29,402 --> 00:30:33,486
even if I keep seeing Hyeondo?

353
00:30:35,712 --> 00:30:40,724
You won't hate me?

354
00:30:54,302 --> 00:30:56,391
Have you been eating?

355
00:31:01,412 --> 00:31:03,479
You look so pale.

356
00:31:04,082 --> 00:31:06,115
Have you been eating at all?

357
00:31:12,232 --> 00:31:13,241
Eunsu...

358
00:31:14,942 --> 00:31:16,037
I haven't been eating.

359
00:31:19,152 --> 00:31:21,249
Why not? That upsets me so much.

360
00:31:22,752 --> 00:31:24,849
I did it to upset you.

361
00:31:26,502 --> 00:31:31,590
I wanted you to know how miserable I was,

362
00:31:32,902 --> 00:31:34,953
how I couldn't eat or sleep.

363
00:31:39,302 --> 00:31:41,306
I wanted you to hurt as much as I did.

364
00:31:48,362 --> 00:31:49,447
Why would you do that?

365
00:31:50,952 --> 00:31:52,050
Why?

366
00:31:55,132 --> 00:31:57,215
Why were you so mean to me?

367
00:31:59,172 --> 00:32:01,178
That's not who you are.

368
00:32:02,862 --> 00:32:04,930
Doing that would cause you greater pain.

369
00:32:14,412 --> 00:32:16,443
I'm sorry, Eunsu.

370
00:32:17,872 --> 00:32:19,913
I'm to blame.

371
00:32:22,062 --> 00:32:24,068
This is all my fault.

372
00:32:26,232 --> 00:32:29,297
Listening to you blaming yourself,

373
00:32:30,692 --> 00:32:31,773
I know you're back.

374
00:32:35,452 --> 00:32:38,452
My real mom's back.

375
00:33:12,422 --> 00:33:15,428
The woman I'm seeing

376
00:33:16,142 --> 00:33:18,219
is Jiwan's little sister Eunsu.

377
00:33:22,402 --> 00:33:23,500
But I heard

378
00:33:27,242 --> 00:33:29,267
she's your daughter.

379
00:33:33,152 --> 00:33:34,220
She's not, right?

380
00:33:38,832 --> 00:33:40,867
Is it true?

381
00:33:41,182 --> 00:33:42,186
Father.

382
00:33:46,842 --> 00:33:48,871
Father!

383
00:33:55,652 --> 00:33:57,653
If that's true,

384
00:33:59,372 --> 00:34:00,469
if that happens to be true,

385
00:34:01,342 --> 00:34:02,409
what would you tell your mother?

386
00:34:03,012 --> 00:34:05,098
And how would you treat me?

387
00:34:08,422 --> 00:34:11,437
You moron.

388
00:34:12,702 --> 00:34:15,773
I have failed as a father.

389
00:34:16,412 --> 00:34:19,490
My own son thinks I'm capable of that!

390
00:34:20,192 --> 00:34:23,216
How could you ask me such a ridiculous thing?

391
00:34:24,012 --> 00:34:25,086
You didn't think to defend me in front of

392
00:34:25,752 --> 00:34:28,834
those who told you such a ridiculous lie?

393
00:34:29,572 --> 00:34:31,584
Do you really think

394
00:34:31,692 --> 00:34:35,706
I would cheat on your mother like that?

395
00:34:42,362 --> 00:34:44,377
You're saying it's not true?

396
00:34:45,582 --> 00:34:47,644
You are crazy.

397
00:34:48,702 --> 00:34:50,786
If you that is how you think of me,

398
00:34:51,542 --> 00:34:53,603
I must disown you.

399
00:34:55,892 --> 00:34:57,901
Father, so it's not true?

400
00:35:07,582 --> 00:35:08,648
Father,

401
00:35:11,062 --> 00:35:13,091
I'm sorry for doubting you.

402
00:35:14,522 --> 00:35:16,574
Thank you.

403
00:35:19,402 --> 00:35:20,465
Tell her to come in.

404
00:35:24,432 --> 00:35:27,496
Oh, you must be crazy!

405
00:35:28,072 --> 00:35:30,098
You spent the night with Han Eunsu?

406
00:35:30,332 --> 00:35:33,355
What did you all night? Tell me!

407
00:35:33,562 --> 00:35:34,621
Mom, this is my workplace.

408
00:35:35,152 --> 00:35:36,239
And we're in front of father.

409
00:35:37,022 --> 00:35:40,066
Who care about that?

410
00:35:41,412 --> 00:35:43,486
Why are you making me repeat myself!

411
00:35:44,152 --> 00:35:45,234
Break up with Han Eunsu right now!

412
00:35:45,972 --> 00:35:47,011
Father,

413
00:35:47,362 --> 00:35:49,385
did you hear what Ms. Jeong Sugyeong said?

414
00:35:49,592 --> 00:35:50,607
You said anyone was okay

415
00:35:50,742 --> 00:35:52,838
as long as I was in love,

416
00:35:53,702 --> 00:35:54,788
so please talk to mother for me.

417
00:35:55,562 --> 00:35:58,567
That was when that woman wasn't Han Eunsu.

418
00:35:59,842 --> 00:36:00,875
Father.

419
00:36:01,172 --> 00:36:03,256
With Han Eunsu, it's a different story.

420
00:36:04,012 --> 00:36:07,069
Your mom and I feel the same way.

421
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:09,656
So break up with Han Eunsu.

422
00:36:10,322 --> 00:36:11,364
Father...

423
00:36:12,202 --> 00:36:14,211
That's not what you said.

424
00:36:14,292 --> 00:36:15,383
Why? You can't do it?

425
00:36:16,202 --> 00:36:19,241
If your mom's not enough, I'll do it myself.

426
00:36:20,322 --> 00:36:22,354
If you don't want me stepping in,

427
00:36:22,642 --> 00:36:24,651
you have only one choice.

428
00:36:26,922 --> 00:36:28,967
End things on your own.

429
00:36:29,372 --> 00:36:32,381
Father, what's wrong with you?

430
00:36:33,272 --> 00:36:34,281
Let's keep this short and simple.

431
00:36:34,362 --> 00:36:35,451
I can't give you much time.

432
00:36:46,352 --> 00:36:47,431
Grandma,

433
00:36:48,142 --> 00:36:49,147
Eunsu's home.

434
00:36:50,362 --> 00:36:52,386
How dare you come crawling back in?

435
00:36:52,602 --> 00:36:53,686
Are you returning in glory?

436
00:36:54,442 --> 00:36:57,520
Don't you know what a scary world it is?

437
00:36:58,222 --> 00:37:00,269
Grandma, I'm sorry.

438
00:37:00,692 --> 00:37:02,756
I know what I did was wrong.

439
00:37:03,332 --> 00:37:05,338
Mom, you're trying too hard to please Seonhui.

440
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:07,005
Get out.

441
00:37:07,662 --> 00:37:08,668
How could you act like that?

442
00:37:09,262 --> 00:37:11,277
Don't you have any respect for us?

443
00:37:11,412 --> 00:37:14,418
I spoiled you rotten!

444
00:37:15,072 --> 00:37:18,075
Mother, please don't be mad.

445
00:37:18,372 --> 00:37:20,455
Eunsu feels really badly about it, grandma.

446
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:26,253
Grandma,

447
00:37:26,352 --> 00:37:28,376
didn't you miss me?

448
00:37:28,592 --> 00:37:31,659
All I could think of was you.

449
00:37:32,262 --> 00:37:34,321
Then why didn't you call?

450
00:37:34,852 --> 00:37:37,881
Mother, Eunsu hasn't eaten dinner yet.

451
00:37:38,142 --> 00:37:40,150
She doesn't deserve dinner!

452
00:37:43,712 --> 00:37:45,785
Haengsuk bought atka mackerel.

453
00:37:46,442 --> 00:37:47,464
You should eat that.

454
00:37:51,122 --> 00:37:54,176
If you try this again, you're dead, okay?

455
00:37:54,662 --> 00:37:57,745
Do you know how scared we were of Seonhui?

456
00:37:58,492 --> 00:38:00,535
Haengsuk, please stop.

457
00:38:08,892 --> 00:38:09,892
You!

458
00:38:09,892 --> 00:38:11,919
Don't even think about taking time.

459
00:38:12,162 --> 00:38:14,162
Break up with Han Eunsu right now.

460
00:38:15,472 --> 00:38:17,496
First it was you, and now it's father.

461
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:18,718
Why are you doing this to me?

462
00:38:19,312 --> 00:38:22,375
I told you I'm never breaking up with Eunsu.

463
00:38:22,942 --> 00:38:25,970
Your father looked like he meant every word.

464
00:38:26,222 --> 00:38:28,304
Mom, I mean every word, too.

465
00:38:29,042 --> 00:38:30,051
I'm in no mood to joke around!

466
00:38:30,942 --> 00:38:32,024
You want me to get involved?

467
00:38:32,762 --> 00:38:35,771
You want me to threaten her and beat her up?

468
00:38:35,852 --> 00:38:37,935
You think I do this because I enjoy it?

469
00:38:42,032 --> 00:38:43,119
Oh, my!

470
00:38:44,702 --> 00:38:48,720
Why is he being so stubborn?

471
00:38:48,882 --> 00:38:52,900
Taesu and Hyeondo are bound for trouble.

472
00:38:53,062 --> 00:38:54,109
Man!

473
00:38:54,532 --> 00:38:55,558
My head...

474
00:39:00,362 --> 00:39:01,417
Your call is being forwarded to

475
00:39:01,912 --> 00:39:04,983
an automated voice message system.

476
00:39:20,542 --> 00:39:22,606
You just couldn't keep away, huh?

477
00:39:23,182 --> 00:39:25,234
Why didn't you answer your phone?

478
00:39:25,702 --> 00:39:27,703
Is something wrong?

479
00:39:28,282 --> 00:39:31,360
Did you get scolded for staying out all night?

480
00:39:32,062 --> 00:39:33,069
They scolded me,

481
00:39:33,762 --> 00:39:35,861
pestering me about what I did with you.

482
00:39:36,752 --> 00:39:38,795
I wouldn't be mad had I really done something.

483
00:39:41,302 --> 00:39:45,309
I called because I have good news.

484
00:39:46,152 --> 00:39:47,153
What?

485
00:39:47,252 --> 00:39:48,289
You know what?

486
00:39:49,632 --> 00:39:51,705
My family is okay with you.

487
00:39:53,852 --> 00:39:55,913
Mom and Jiwan all said they're okay with it,

488
00:39:56,462 --> 00:39:58,483
as if they never objected to you.

489
00:39:59,072 --> 00:40:00,155
I feel like I'm dreaming.

490
00:40:01,302 --> 00:40:03,377
We can see each other now.

491
00:40:05,232 --> 00:40:08,320
Why is it so hard being your girlfriend?

492
00:40:09,112 --> 00:40:10,185
It's not like you're all that special.

493
00:40:10,842 --> 00:40:11,917
Why is it so hard?

494
00:40:18,632 --> 00:40:19,640
What's wrong?

495
00:40:20,432 --> 00:40:21,529
Why won't you say anything?

496
00:40:26,452 --> 00:40:27,500
Hyeondo?

497
00:40:29,902 --> 00:40:30,946
Right,

498
00:40:32,142 --> 00:40:33,225
that's great.

499
00:40:33,972 --> 00:40:35,047
That's really great.

500
00:40:41,852 --> 00:40:43,855
Nothing bad will ever happen again.

501
00:40:45,662 --> 00:40:46,761
Everything will be all right.

502
00:40:58,462 --> 00:40:59,527
Good morning.

503
00:41:10,352 --> 00:41:11,391
Isn't this a letter of resignation?

504
00:41:14,282 --> 00:41:14,364
Yes.

505
00:41:15,102 --> 00:41:16,109
Why would you turn this in?

506
00:41:16,802 --> 00:41:17,848
You know Mr. Jang didn't sumbit any names.

507
00:41:18,262 --> 00:41:19,298
He's going to try to keep us all.

508
00:41:19,622 --> 00:41:20,669
For how long?

509
00:41:22,892 --> 00:41:24,911
He can do it once,

510
00:41:25,082 --> 00:41:26,175
but when the bigwigs keeps asking for the list,

511
00:41:27,012 --> 00:41:29,079
no one would resist it forever.

512
00:41:31,732 --> 00:41:33,824
I can't do this anymore.

513
00:41:34,652 --> 00:41:36,699
An old friend from school

514
00:41:37,122 --> 00:41:39,167
is starting a small business,

515
00:41:39,572 --> 00:41:41,581
and he needs someone in accounting.

516
00:41:44,142 --> 00:41:45,231
I'd rather get a smaller paycheck than

517
00:41:46,032 --> 00:41:49,035
end up losing all my hair from stress here.

518
00:41:52,502 --> 00:41:54,546
Are you sure about that?

519
00:41:54,942 --> 00:41:58,950
What about you? Are you all right?

520
00:41:59,942 --> 00:42:02,945
You haven't met your quota for this month.

521
00:42:03,932 --> 00:42:08,935
The Best Global loan isn't working out?

522
00:42:08,962 --> 00:42:10,963
What are you going to do?

523
00:42:14,812 --> 00:42:15,911
Well...

524
00:42:17,302 --> 00:42:19,306
I'm just hanging on.

525
00:42:20,822 --> 00:42:23,825
I've gotten this far.

526
00:42:34,782 --> 00:42:35,831
Oh, my!

527
00:42:38,562 --> 00:42:40,573
What brings you here?

528
00:42:40,672 --> 00:42:42,733
I came to get consulted about getting a loan.

529
00:42:43,972 --> 00:42:46,004
It's a very small amount, though.

530
00:42:46,292 --> 00:42:47,335
Don't say that.

531
00:42:47,722 --> 00:42:49,744
I'll get you a personal loan person.

532
00:42:49,942 --> 00:42:50,960
Just a second.

533
00:42:51,122 --> 00:42:52,126
How nice of you.

534
00:42:53,612 --> 00:42:55,683
Both Taesu and you are so nice.

535
00:42:56,322 --> 00:42:58,377
This is why I love old acquaintances.

536
00:42:59,202 --> 00:43:00,226
Taesu...

537
00:43:00,962 --> 00:43:01,994
You mean the president of Best Global?

538
00:43:02,282 --> 00:43:03,289
Yes!

539
00:43:04,632 --> 00:43:05,725
You still keep in touch?

540
00:43:06,562 --> 00:43:09,599
You were always like siblings back then, too.

541
00:43:09,932 --> 00:43:11,011
We're involved in each other's lives too much

542
00:43:11,722 --> 00:43:12,728
not to keep in touch.

543
00:43:13,322 --> 00:43:14,368
And Taesu believes

544
00:43:14,782 --> 00:43:16,824
long-time friends are the best.

545
00:43:17,202 --> 00:43:18,249
Right.

546
00:43:18,672 --> 00:43:20,711
That's how he became so successful.

547
00:43:21,062 --> 00:43:26,084
There was a reason why Taesu liked you so much.

548
00:43:26,282 --> 00:43:27,286
What was it?

549
00:43:27,682 --> 00:43:30,687
Mr. Jang liked me?

550
00:43:31,182 --> 00:43:32,191
Why...

551
00:43:32,272 --> 00:43:34,272
Well,

552
00:43:34,272 --> 00:43:34,369
oh!

553
00:43:35,242 --> 00:43:37,295
You used to make notes on everything.

554
00:43:37,772 --> 00:43:39,845
Taesu said you were meticulous

555
00:43:40,502 --> 00:43:42,569
and scolded me to be more like you.

556
00:43:44,072 --> 00:43:45,099
You mean the transaction notes?

557
00:43:45,342 --> 00:43:46,423
Mr. Jang remembers that?

558
00:43:47,152 --> 00:43:48,173
Yes!

559
00:44:00,532 --> 00:44:01,533
Hyeondo.

560
00:44:07,232 --> 00:44:08,258
I'm sorry.

561
00:44:08,492 --> 00:44:09,550
What!

562
00:44:13,792 --> 00:44:15,824
I'm sorry about saying mean things to you.

563
00:44:16,112 --> 00:44:17,195
I didn't mean them.

564
00:44:19,552 --> 00:44:21,567
That's all you're sorry about?

565
00:44:22,122 --> 00:44:24,194
Why didn't you talk to me about it?

566
00:44:25,342 --> 00:44:28,411
You just demanded me to break up with her.

567
00:44:34,132 --> 00:44:35,220
Well,

568
00:44:36,012 --> 00:44:39,018
I get that you were miserable, too,

569
00:44:40,072 --> 00:44:43,123
but from now on, talk to me first about Eunsu.

570
00:44:44,362 --> 00:44:45,427
I'll have to see about that.

571
00:44:46,762 --> 00:44:48,787
You're such a jerk.

572
00:45:04,602 --> 00:45:06,683
Honey, why aren't you getting ready for work?

573
00:45:07,412 --> 00:45:09,417
I am, just a second.

574
00:45:10,032 --> 00:45:12,050
Isn't that from over 20 years ago?

575
00:45:12,212 --> 00:45:13,284
Why are you going through that?

576
00:45:13,932 --> 00:45:17,008
An old client wants to see her records.

577
00:45:19,542 --> 00:45:20,594
Here they are.

578
00:45:21,062 --> 00:45:22,143
If you found it, go wash up.

579
00:45:22,872 --> 00:45:24,907
I made mugwort soup for you.

580
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:27,276
Girls, come and eat. Yeongju, Eunsu...

581
00:45:28,162 --> 00:45:31,196
Wait, Eunsu went home.

582
00:45:31,502 --> 00:45:32,516
Oh, boy.

583
00:45:32,642 --> 00:45:34,676
They say you notice it when someone's gone,

584
00:45:34,982 --> 00:45:38,039
and I miss having her here.

585
00:45:38,552 --> 00:45:38,633
Right.

586
00:45:39,362 --> 00:45:41,394
She didn't make a sound, but it felt lively.

587
00:45:42,942 --> 00:45:44,966
Did you see how Eunsu just left

588
00:45:45,182 --> 00:45:46,253
when I asked her to stay for dinner?

589
00:45:46,892 --> 00:45:48,991
She wanted to eat her mom's cooking.

590
00:45:49,882 --> 00:45:50,884
Of course!

591
00:45:50,902 --> 00:45:52,906
She couldn't like someone else's mom's cooking.

592
00:45:53,692 --> 00:45:56,749
And all you want is meat, right?

593
00:45:57,262 --> 00:45:59,296
You only made dad's favorite dishes, right?

594
00:45:59,602 --> 00:46:01,608
Mom, you only care about dad.

595
00:46:01,662 --> 00:46:03,666
Is it that obvious?

596
00:46:04,582 --> 00:46:07,667
Being too lovey-dovey at your age is unsightly.

597
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:11,511
When am I getting a new baby sibling?

598
00:46:12,222 --> 00:46:14,318
How could you say that in front of your dad?

599
00:46:16,372 --> 00:46:17,407
Answer your phone.

600
00:46:21,442 --> 00:46:22,488
Hello?

601
00:46:23,532 --> 00:46:24,559
Who is...

602
00:46:25,822 --> 00:46:28,825
An agency president?

603
00:46:32,132 --> 00:46:34,159
Ohyeah Media?

604
00:46:34,402 --> 00:46:35,493
I've never heard of it.

605
00:46:37,342 --> 00:46:39,385
Wait, I think I've heard of it.

606
00:46:39,772 --> 00:46:41,837
I don't know much about this field, so...

607
00:46:42,422 --> 00:46:44,459
That's okay.

608
00:46:45,422 --> 00:46:48,426
I came to make you a special deal.

609
00:46:49,412 --> 00:46:52,480
Instead of struggling in the small Korean market,

610
00:46:53,092 --> 00:46:54,173
how about China?

611
00:46:55,412 --> 00:46:56,473
China?

612
00:46:57,022 --> 00:46:57,111
You know?

613
00:46:57,912 --> 00:46:59,925
The Chinese market is on the rise.

614
00:47:00,042 --> 00:47:03,121
And that's why we need a writer like you.

615
00:47:03,832 --> 00:47:05,907
I've heard from so many people in the field

616
00:47:06,582 --> 00:47:08,585
how great your ideas are.

617
00:47:08,612 --> 00:47:09,671
Who? Where?

618
00:47:10,702 --> 00:47:11,761
From different places.

619
00:47:12,292 --> 00:47:14,324
Was it the director?

620
00:47:14,612 --> 00:47:15,665
Director?

621
00:47:16,142 --> 00:47:17,226
You mean my director?

622
00:47:17,982 --> 00:47:21,034
Who cares who I heard it from!

623
00:47:21,502 --> 00:47:23,563
The important thing here is

624
00:47:24,112 --> 00:47:26,126
your brilliant ideas.

625
00:47:26,252 --> 00:47:30,256
Can you send me a synopsis?

626
00:47:30,292 --> 00:47:32,303
I'll use that

627
00:47:32,402 --> 00:47:35,407
to break into the Chinese market.

628
00:48:18,752 --> 00:48:22,790
I feel his absence.

629
00:48:23,612 --> 00:48:26,626
The office feels so empty today.

630
00:48:28,022 --> 00:48:30,117
People come and go every day.

631
00:48:31,542 --> 00:48:33,597
Next month,

632
00:48:34,092 --> 00:48:36,151
your desk might be empty.

633
00:48:41,662 --> 00:48:43,743
Or yours.

634
00:48:50,922 --> 00:48:54,956
Meet your quota for this month.

635
00:48:59,482 --> 00:49:00,578
Eat up.

636
00:49:01,442 --> 00:49:04,510
This is domestic pork, so it's very tender.

637
00:49:05,122 --> 00:49:06,189
So eat up.

638
00:49:07,382 --> 00:49:08,476
- Mr. Yun. / - Yes?

639
00:49:09,322 --> 00:49:11,348
If we're going out, let us know in advance.

640
00:49:11,582 --> 00:49:13,649
We all ate dinner already.

641
00:49:14,252 --> 00:49:15,336
Really?

642
00:49:16,092 --> 00:49:17,168
Then eat a little bit.

643
00:49:17,852 --> 00:49:20,937
There aren't many team leaders who take

644
00:49:21,702 --> 00:49:24,795
their teams out to encourage them.

645
00:49:25,632 --> 00:49:27,730
You should be happy

646
00:49:28,612 --> 00:49:29,638
you met a team leader like me.

647
00:49:29,872 --> 00:49:30,950
We're happy, Mr. Yun.

648
00:49:31,652 --> 00:49:32,664
Thank you. Let's drink to that.

649
00:49:32,772 --> 00:49:33,789
Okay.

650
00:49:33,942 --> 00:49:35,959
Drink up.

651
00:49:38,982 --> 00:49:40,011
Hyeondo,

652
00:49:40,272 --> 00:49:42,285
is Eunsu doing well?

653
00:49:43,302 --> 00:49:45,380
Well, she's doing okay.

654
00:49:46,512 --> 00:49:48,589
Did she find a better job somewhere else?

655
00:49:49,282 --> 00:49:49,367
Yes!

656
00:49:50,132 --> 00:49:52,200
She has to get a better job than here.

657
00:49:54,542 --> 00:49:55,581
Jiwan,

658
00:49:56,602 --> 00:49:57,626
cheers.

659
00:49:58,752 --> 00:49:59,764
Okay.

660
00:50:08,792 --> 00:50:11,867
Jiwan, what kind of women do you like?

661
00:50:13,912 --> 00:50:14,965
Me?

662
00:50:21,032 --> 00:50:22,113
Well,

663
00:50:22,842 --> 00:50:24,857
I'd like her to be near me.

664
00:50:26,422 --> 00:50:28,407
It'd be good if it's someone

665
00:50:28,407 --> 00:50:30,392
I work with so we can help each other.

666
00:50:33,202 --> 00:50:35,266
Someone who seems grown-up

667
00:50:36,922 --> 00:50:38,959
but at the same time, a bit immature.

668
00:50:39,292 --> 00:50:40,341
Weird, right?

669
00:50:43,132 --> 00:50:46,140
Do you like women with bright personalities?

670
00:50:46,692 --> 00:50:47,726
Bright is good.

671
00:50:48,952 --> 00:50:52,969
Do you also like eccentric women?

672
00:50:54,912 --> 00:50:55,976
Yes, very.

673
00:51:01,712 --> 00:51:04,768
But you're a bit shy,

674
00:51:05,272 --> 00:51:08,328
so you can't ask women out, can you?

675
00:51:09,542 --> 00:51:10,605
If I had to, I would.

676
00:51:11,172 --> 00:51:12,250
But that would depend on the situation.

677
00:51:12,952 --> 00:51:14,987
It depends on the situation...

678
00:51:15,302 --> 00:51:19,371
So if the situation is right, you can?

679
00:51:19,992 --> 00:51:21,075
I guess I could.

680
00:51:22,922 --> 00:51:23,929
Jiwan,

681
00:51:24,952 --> 00:51:27,991
you want to leave?

682
00:51:28,342 --> 00:51:29,364
What?

683
00:51:29,562 --> 00:51:31,630
It's boring here.

684
00:51:32,242 --> 00:51:33,304
I'll buy you coffee.

685
00:51:33,862 --> 00:51:34,867
Juri!

686
00:51:36,172 --> 00:51:39,176
Despite how casual this dinner seems,

687
00:51:39,212 --> 00:51:41,269
don't forget to remain professional!

688
00:51:43,382 --> 00:51:44,427
But I didn't...

689
00:51:44,832 --> 00:51:46,837
We're here for encouragement,

690
00:51:47,332 --> 00:51:48,411
but you're going on about nonsense!

691
00:51:49,122 --> 00:51:50,180
Eat the pork!

692
00:51:50,702 --> 00:51:51,707
It's cooked.

693
00:51:53,692 --> 00:51:54,754
What did Juri say?

694
00:51:55,312 --> 00:51:56,367
Nobody heard it.

695
00:51:57,552 --> 00:51:58,605
Some nonsense.

696
00:52:00,132 --> 00:52:01,201
How did you hear her?

697
00:52:02,522 --> 00:52:03,525
Do you have the Bionic Woman's ears?

698
00:52:03,552 --> 00:52:04,557
Eat the pork.

699
00:52:05,052 --> 00:52:07,144
Jiwan, you have some pork, too.

700
00:52:10,922 --> 00:52:11,945
What's wrong with you?

701
00:52:12,152 --> 00:52:13,156
What did she say?

702
00:52:13,992 --> 00:52:16,004
Come and have some fruit.

703
00:52:18,082 --> 00:52:19,134
My head's itchy.

704
00:52:23,242 --> 00:52:24,259
Yeongju!

705
00:52:26,672 --> 00:52:28,747
Even if you're home, you should put on makeup

706
00:52:29,422 --> 00:52:32,422
and wear something pretty!

707
00:52:32,422 --> 00:52:36,423
Why would I put on makeup to write all night?

708
00:52:37,212 --> 00:52:39,213
I put up with you because you're my daughter,

709
00:52:39,312 --> 00:52:41,383
but how could any man ever like you like that?

710
00:52:44,482 --> 00:52:45,503
What?

711
00:52:45,692 --> 00:52:47,774
Mom, you shouldn't be like that.

712
00:52:48,512 --> 00:52:49,589
You're the only one who thinks little of me,

713
00:52:50,282 --> 00:52:53,377
but at work, I'm very appreciated.

714
00:52:54,992 --> 00:52:58,060
Where and when do people appreciate you?

715
00:52:58,672 --> 00:53:00,766
Is that deal with that agency working out?

716
00:53:01,612 --> 00:53:06,619
Yes, he said my idea will be a hit in China.

717
00:53:08,132 --> 00:53:09,177
Really?

718
00:53:09,582 --> 00:53:11,614
Of course.

719
00:53:11,902 --> 00:53:15,997
So don't scold your daughter who works hard.

720
00:53:17,622 --> 00:53:19,627
Okay, Ms. Successful Daughter.

721
00:53:21,212 --> 00:53:22,290
Go and wash your hair.

722
00:53:22,992 --> 00:53:23,087
- Ouch! / - You're filthy.

723
00:53:23,942 --> 00:53:25,003
- Don't eat with your hand! / - Stop!

724
00:53:25,552 --> 00:53:27,568
Go and wash your hair!

725
00:53:29,142 --> 00:53:31,171
Why did

726
00:53:31,922 --> 00:53:33,926
Ms. Lee tell such a lie about Eunsu?

727
00:53:35,522 --> 00:53:37,593
It wasn't just Jeongae's lie.

728
00:53:38,232 --> 00:53:40,316
I jumped to conclusions, too.

729
00:53:43,172 --> 00:53:46,269
She had a bankbook with a lot of money in it.

730
00:53:48,932 --> 00:53:51,969
There were rumors about her and Taesu,

731
00:53:52,302 --> 00:53:54,360
and when she told me Taesu gave her the money,

732
00:53:54,882 --> 00:53:55,973
I just jumped to conclusions.

733
00:53:57,922 --> 00:53:58,926
Money?

734
00:54:00,522 --> 00:54:04,593
Are you sure she got it from Mr. Jang Taesu?

735
00:54:06,082 --> 00:54:09,082
But when I think about it,

736
00:54:09,082 --> 00:54:12,130
Taesu couldn't have had that kind of money.

737
00:54:14,172 --> 00:54:18,174
You said Ms. Lee worked at Taehu Industry?

738
00:54:18,372 --> 00:54:19,385
Yes.

739
00:54:20,852 --> 00:54:21,919
She was the bookkeeper.

740
00:54:22,812 --> 00:54:23,864
Bookkeeper?

741
00:54:24,332 --> 00:54:25,366
Yes.

742
00:54:27,732 --> 00:54:29,778
Maybe

743
00:54:30,192 --> 00:54:33,251
she took money from father's company...

744
00:54:41,502 --> 00:54:45,540
Jeongae wouldn't do such a thing...

745
00:54:46,372 --> 00:54:50,378
You said Director Lee was in charge of finance?

746
00:54:50,972 --> 00:54:53,001
Should I call him and ask?

747
00:54:59,292 --> 00:55:00,298
Oh, Ms. Lee Jeongae.

748
00:55:05,652 --> 00:55:07,730
You closed the account in '93.

749
00:55:08,432 --> 00:55:11,469
Yes, I closed it and withdrew all the money.

750
00:55:11,802 --> 00:55:12,849
My...

751
00:55:13,272 --> 00:55:14,361
You kept all that in your notebook?

752
00:55:15,162 --> 00:55:16,241
But it happened over 20 years ago.

753
00:55:16,952 --> 00:55:17,986
How interesting.

754
00:55:19,522 --> 00:55:20,574
It was a force of habit.

755
00:55:21,042 --> 00:55:22,133
I'm not this bad now,

756
00:55:22,952 --> 00:55:24,975
but that was my first corporate client,

757
00:55:25,182 --> 00:55:27,226
so I kept notes on everything.

758
00:55:27,622 --> 00:55:28,631
I hope you're not offended.

759
00:55:29,522 --> 00:55:30,541
No, I'm not.

760
00:55:30,712 --> 00:55:31,788
Why would I be?

761
00:55:33,052 --> 00:55:35,070
May I take a look?

762
00:55:36,722 --> 00:55:37,765
Excuse me?

763
00:55:42,702 --> 00:55:42,791
Oh!

764
00:55:43,592 --> 00:55:45,618
When did Taesu send me this text?

765
00:55:45,852 --> 00:55:46,907
Is it urgent?

766
00:55:49,972 --> 00:55:51,061
Is it a text from Mr. Jang Taesu?

767
00:55:51,862 --> 00:55:52,869
Yes.

768
00:55:52,932 --> 00:55:54,021
Why does he want to see me next week?

769
00:55:54,822 --> 00:55:55,914
I'll have to see if I have time.

770
00:55:57,892 --> 00:55:58,990
Ms. Lee,

771
00:55:59,872 --> 00:56:00,877
if possible...

772
00:56:01,372 --> 00:56:02,379
Yes?

773
00:56:03,042 --> 00:56:04,089
Where are you meeting him?

774
00:56:04,512 --> 00:56:07,610
May I accompany you?

775
00:56:09,802 --> 00:56:10,828
Well, that's...

776
00:56:11,062 --> 00:56:13,096
I'm not sure how Taesu would take it.

777
00:56:14,162 --> 00:56:16,227
If I can't come with you,

778
00:56:16,812 --> 00:56:17,858
we can make it look like a coincidence.

779
00:56:18,272 --> 00:56:19,297
I would really love to

780
00:56:19,522 --> 00:56:21,599
see him, if that's possible.

781
00:56:25,552 --> 00:56:26,584
If it's too much...

782
00:56:26,872 --> 00:56:27,959
It's okay.

783
00:56:29,092 --> 00:56:32,167
You're helping me out with my loan, so okay.

784
00:56:33,202 --> 00:56:34,208
Thank you.

785
00:56:34,262 --> 00:56:35,268
Thank you very much.

786
00:56:36,642 --> 00:56:37,691
It's nothing.

787
00:56:38,832 --> 00:56:38,930
Oh,

788
00:56:40,822 --> 00:56:42,906
may I take a look at your notes?

789
00:56:49,592 --> 00:56:50,593
Sure.

790
00:57:34,592 --> 00:57:35,640
Your family...

791
00:57:39,762 --> 00:57:39,846
It's nothing.

792
00:57:40,602 --> 00:57:41,663
Director Lee!

793
00:57:52,192 --> 00:57:55,194
I still have questions about that day.

794
00:57:55,212 --> 00:57:58,269
I know he failed to develop new technology,

795
00:57:59,372 --> 00:58:02,438
but where did Sangjun's great fortune go?

796
00:58:12,112 --> 00:58:14,154
So he closed all the accounts

797
00:58:14,532 --> 00:58:16,588
in the second half of '93?

798
00:58:17,692 --> 00:58:19,699
There weren't just a couple.

799
00:58:19,762 --> 00:58:21,797
How many is this?

800
00:58:22,112 --> 00:58:23,208
There were at least 40.

801
00:58:24,772 --> 00:58:25,843
40 accounts?

802
00:58:27,092 --> 00:58:29,121
How much was it?

803
00:58:33,382 --> 00:58:34,443
I don't believe him.

804
00:58:34,992 --> 00:58:36,090
I thought he got a couple accounts like me,

805
00:58:36,972 --> 00:58:38,014
but that wasn't it?

806
00:58:39,362 --> 00:58:39,451
My!

807
00:58:40,252 --> 00:58:41,308
He stole 40!

808
00:58:41,812 --> 00:58:43,834
He stole all of them?

809
00:58:44,962 --> 00:58:49,058
That means Taesu stole all of Sangjun's money!

810
00:58:57,282 --> 00:59:00,327
He tried to contact Director Lee.

811
00:59:02,192 --> 00:59:04,286
Is Jiwan suspicious of me?

812
00:59:06,342 --> 00:59:10,380
What does he have? How much does he know?

813
00:59:11,282 --> 00:59:12,366
If it's about your past,

814
00:59:13,122 --> 00:59:16,169
he might go away if you gave him money.

815
00:59:17,312 --> 00:59:20,348
No, that won't solve anything.

816
00:59:21,452 --> 00:59:24,481
The past isn't such a simple matter.

817
01:00:37,002 --> 01:00:40,030
Those documents are very important to me.

818
01:00:40,282 --> 01:00:42,293
Tell me how much you need.

819
01:00:42,392 --> 01:00:45,418
Isn't it money you need?

820
01:00:46,212 --> 01:00:47,221
Kang Jaecheol...

821
01:00:48,112 --> 01:00:50,150
He's at Segi Bank, so find out about him.

822
01:00:50,492 --> 01:00:53,498
They want to see the blueprint.

823
01:00:54,092 --> 01:00:54,176
Do you think that's okay?

824
01:00:54,932 --> 01:00:55,985
You finished early.

825
01:00:57,002 --> 01:01:00,063
They wanted to see the blueprint, too?

826
01:01:00,612 --> 01:01:02,667
He obtained the blueprint.
