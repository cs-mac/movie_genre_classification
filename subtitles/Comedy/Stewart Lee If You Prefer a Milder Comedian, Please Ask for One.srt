1
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:26,900
Sun Sin.

2
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:29,190
Mom.

3
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:36,020
Have you eaten dinner?

4
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:42,260
Mom, I'm sorry.

5
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:45,560
Why are you sorry?

6
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:50,330
Mom, I didn't change.

7
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:54,000
I am still... still Lee Sun Sin.

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,940
I'm your youngest daughter,

9
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:59,510
Hye Sin eonni's and Yu Sin eonni's sister,

10
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:04,280
Granny's youngest grandchild,
U Ju's aunt, right?

11
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:09,420
It will stay forever like this. 
Right?

12
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:14,930
So, treat me the same way.

13
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:18,230
Treat me exactly like
you treated me before.

14
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:23,370
If you don't do that,
I'll get really mad.

15
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:37,140
Let's go, Nunim.

16
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,280
Let's go.

17
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:12,010
Nunim, the press conference concluded successfully.

18
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:18,980
Since it ended well,
how about keeping your distance from her?

19
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:21,550
Aren't you scared?

20
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,120
With what happened to her father and all.

21
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:28,890
If you keep seeing her,
you'll always be on your toes.

22
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:34,250
Once the reporters have settled down,
let's carry on like before.

23
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:46,880
This...

24
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,350
- Zero
- Zero.

25
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:49,080
Here.

26
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,280
Zero.

27
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,320
Your mother isn't back yet?

28
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:56,790
Yes, I hope the reporters outside have left.

29
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:58,990
Mom cannot meet them.

30
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:02,660
You haven't heard from Sun Sin yet?

31
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:08,160
Yes.
I don't even know if she has money.
She just left like that.

32
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,000
She probably went to see her real mom.

33
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,980
What?

34
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:13,430
She has a wealthy mother.
What's there to worry about?

35
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,140
She'll just give her money
if she doesn't have it.

36
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:16,010
Yu Sin.

37
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:19,180
Are you going to keep bitching like that?

38
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:22,480
Sun Sin is this family's flesh and blood.
Your sister.

39
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,570
What the heck are you saying?

40
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:28,430
She's our flesh and blood?
How could you say that?

41
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:30,250
You like her now that
she's dad's daughter.

42
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,840
When you used to bully her before.

43
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:34,560
What did she say?

44
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,210
Why are you saying that?

45
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:39,990
Are you really fine with it?
Can you treat her like before?

46
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:42,660
What can we do?
It's not Sun Sin's fault.

47
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:45,740
I know.
I know, but...

48
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:50,390
Whenever I see her, I can't help but 
recall how Dad has betrayed our family.
I feel uncomfortable.

49
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:54,780
U Ju, do your homework upstairs.

50
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:59,020
Aunt.

51
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:00,220
Sun Sin.

52
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:05,420
Where have you been?

53
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:08,180
Do you know how worried I was?

54
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,480
A girl can't spend the night outside.

55
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:16,800
It will be a big problem
if this becomes a habit.

56
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:19,260
I'm sorry, Granny.

57
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:22,560
Wash your hands.
I'll prepare the food.

58
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:26,550
You haven't even eaten dinner yet?

59
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,570
Here, I made the soup you like.

60
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:06,290
You must be hungry.

61
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:08,060
There's plenty of delicious food.

62
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:12,200
Mom made a lot of side-dishes
while waiting for you.

63
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:30,310
You'll choke.
Eat slowly.

64
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:36,810
Did you meet any reporters outside
when you came home?

65
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:38,280
No, I think they left.

66
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:41,710
What's the use?
They'll come back tomorrow.

67
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,280
Yu Sin.

68
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:48,560
Did I say anything?
I'm going up.

69
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,600
Oh, my. Look at her.

70
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,550
She's probably stressed out
because of the reporters.

71
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:57,550
Just understand her.

72
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:15,350
Eonni.

73
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:24,530
Did you guys know about this?

74
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:27,830
That I'm not Mom's daughter.

75
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:31,130
You're Dad's daughter anyway, aren't you?

76
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:35,540
I feel very uncomfortable with you.

77
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:38,840
I'm also disappointed with our late father.

78
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:42,150
I'm also disappointed with 
how foolish mom is.

79
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:46,550
It must be difficult for you but...

80
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:50,590
it's also difficult for me.
I hope you understand.

81
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,280
You're not sleeping yet?

82
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:20,680
It's been a while since I slept beside you.
Shall we do that now?

83
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,770
That...
Jun Ho.

84
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:12,070
Mi Ryeong's daughter...

85
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:15,010
What does her father do?

86
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:17,210
I don't know, either.

87
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:20,880
Tell me.
I'm dying to know.

88
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:25,650
I tried to get some info from Mi Ryeong
but she just snobbed me.

89
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:30,420
It will come out anyway,
why must she still keep that a secret?

90
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:33,360
Seriously, you...
You asked her that?

91
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:37,030
Why can't I ask?
We're close friends,

92
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:39,230
so she should tell me.

93
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:42,530
I don't know why she won't tell me.

94
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:45,840
What is he like?
Is he married?

95
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,670
I don't know, either.

96
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,240
You obviously know.

97
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,080
That's enough.

98
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,280
What did I do?

99
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:58,680
Oppa. Is Teacher Song's daughter
an aspiring actress?

100
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:00,710
Who said that?

101
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,920
Aspiring actress, Miss A.

102
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,130
Do you know her too?

103
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:10,570
Really?
It runs in the blood.

104
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:11,660
Oh my, oh my, oh my.

105
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,550
This is amazing.

106
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:14,830
Let me see that.

107
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,740
Isn't that your agency's press release?

108
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,680
You don't know?

109
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:30,980
I have to go.

110
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:33,680
Hey! How about breakfast?

111
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:45,660
Nevermind.
You don't need to do that.

112
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:46,760
No, let me.

113
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:49,700
Go and wake Yu Sin up.
Tell her breakfast's ready.

114
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:53,400
I'm not eating breakfast.
I'm late.

115
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:02,550
What should we do with her?
You go and talk to Yu Sin.

116
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:04,380
Yes.

117
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:09,520
How annoying!
The reporters are back again.

118
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,990
Really?

119
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:15,030
Do you think we should move house?

120
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:17,230
Why should we hide?
We didn't do anything wrong.

121
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:19,060
It will be fine after a couple of days.

122
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:22,000
You kept saying that every morning.

123
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:24,200
How long will this continue?

124
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,040
This is really embarrassing.

125
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,240
Stop it, Yu Sin.

126
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:31,910
I'll go and have a look.

127
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:35,210
- Sun Sin.
- Hey, wait.

128
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:45,120
Sun Sin, don't go out.

129
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,550
It will make things worse.

130
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:49,680
It's okay, Eonni.

131
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:03,840
Well... Perhaps...

132
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:08,250
Go home!
I have nothing to do with Song Mi Ryeong.

133
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:10,450
Will you still continue your 
debut as an actress?

134
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:14,480
I heard you were once a trainee in 
Song Mi Ryeong's agency, is that true?

135
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,690
When did you start dreaming 
of becoming an actress?

136
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:20,720
I heard you studied acting under Song Mi Ryeong,
is that true?

137
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:23,660
Please say something.
Please say something.

138
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,130
Stop it!

139
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:36,870
Put those cameras down.
Put them down, I said.

140
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:40,910
I am Gabi Entertainment's CEO, Sin Jun Ho.

141
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:44,950
From now on, all interviews must 
have our company's consent.

142
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:48,620
We will issue a statement soon.

143
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:53,390
If one of those photos you 
took gets publicized,

144
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:58,900
I will sue you for invasion of privacy.
Got it? Get out of here.

145
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:01,460
Get out of here!

146
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:12,110
Hello.

147
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:20,920
How could you foolishly head out like that?

148
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:27,520
How did they find out about me?
How did they find out I was a trainee?

149
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:30,460
Did you tell them?

150
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,130
No, I didn't.

151
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:40,000
Stop lying.
You should also know about 
that press conference too.

152
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:41,840
That...

153
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:48,450
Go and tell Teacher Song to leave me alone.
Stop hurting me already!

154
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:07,530
Sun Sin, why did you blow up like that?

155
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:12,420
He's really worried about you.
He called you many times yesterday.

156
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:14,570
He even came today.

157
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:25,150
Did you tell them?

158
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,620
What?

159
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:29,190
Everything about Sun Sin.

160
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:34,690
Was the press conference not enough?

161
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:37,260
What's going to happen to her in the future?
How could you act so irresponsibly?

162
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:40,200
Have you ever considered her feelings?

163
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:48,270
President, please don't blame her.
I did that.

164
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:49,370
What?

165
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:53,410
Everyone will find out anyway.
And also...

166
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:55,980
Don't underestimate the reporters.

167
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:59,650
You might not know since 
you've never been a reporter.

168
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:02,220
If they smell something, they'll keep 
digging until things get worse

169
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:05,160
and make things more difficult.

170
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,990
Does that even make sense?

171
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:13,230
That's enough. It already happened.
What's the use of arguing about it?

172
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:18,370
Teacher, please...
think about Sun Sin.

173
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:22,040
Don't use Sun Sin to shield you 
from your current predicament.

174
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:26,440
What?
What did you just say to me?

175
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,280
I used Sun Sin?

176
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:30,480
Didn't you use her?

177
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:35,990
All interviews from now on must 
go through the agency.

178
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:38,190
You must seek the agency's approval
if you want to meet her.

179
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:41,490
Don't tackle this amongst yourselves.

180
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:46,630
President Sin, this is between me and my daughter.

181
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:49,930
This wouldn't happen at all 
if you treated her like a daughter.

182
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:53,970
What did you say?
Are you lecturing me?

183
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:57,640
Who are you working for?

184
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:00,210
Me or Sun Sin?

185
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:03,150
I'm doing this for myself.

186
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:10,120
I'll remind you once again.
You've crossed the line this time.

187
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:23,330
Hello.

188
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:24,800
You haven't left yet?

189
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,370
Yes. Just in case you encounter some difficulties.

190
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:28,840
We'll be fine today.

191
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:32,880
Don't worry. You saw what I did, right?
I chased them away yesterday.

192
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:38,750
I can't say about other things,
but my charisma... "What!",
I have confidence in my charisma.

193
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:43,520
And my expression...
This expression of mine is very perky.

194
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,090
No, there's no need to do that today.

195
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:51,230
Don't worry about it.
We're just helping each other.
Let's head out first. 
Come on, U Ju.

196
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:54,530
Let's go.

197
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:12,150
No one's here.

198
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:21,690
Perhaps what I did yesterday
was very effective.

199
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:25,360
I scared the reporters away
so they're afraid to come back.
Right?

200
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:31,600
My aunt's boss came by and 
chased them away.
Idiot.

201
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:45,180
U Ju... 
U Ju, wait for me.
Hey, U Ju!

202
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:53,620
No word from Song Mi Ryeong yet?

203
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:55,460
Yes.

204
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:59,130
She created such a huge mess.
Shouldn't she come and find you?

205
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:01,700
She should come and beg for forgiveness.

206
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:07,200
It's all over the news.
Even attracting a lot of reporters here.

207
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,770
But how could she pretend
like nothing happened?

208
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:11,980
She should compensate you, at least.

209
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:13,440
Compensate?

210
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:17,480
Yes, compensate.
I heard she's filthy rich.

211
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:21,890
A successful actress like that,
don't tell me she doesn't even have assets?

212
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:27,020
Hey! Since things have already become like this,
might as well ask for some compensation.

213
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:31,430
If she has any conscience,
she has to do something for you, at least.

214
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:35,470
Furthermore, how long did you raise her daughter?
How much should she pay you for that?

215
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:38,400
How could you say such a thing?
'Her daughter'?

216
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,600
Why is Sun Sin her daughter?

217
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,810
What I mean is...

218
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:48,680
Anyway, things are already like this,
better meet and settle this.

219
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,880
After raising her daughter up,
you even got hurt.

220
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:55,290
What are you saying?
Did I raise Sun Sin for that woman's sake?

221
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:58,220
How frustrating.
That's not what I meant.

222
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:02,260
Try and bring this up again.

223
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:05,560
Hang on.

224
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:16,210
My son. What's the matter? I got it. 
I'll go and find it right away.

225
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:23,180
Jeong Ae, Chan U left an 
important document at home.

226
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:26,120
Can you look after the shop for me?

227
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,580
Okay.

228
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:29,420
I'm sorry.

229
00:19:58,050 --> 00:20:02,340
Don't misunderstand.
I'm here for my treatment.

230
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:10,160
I won't say anything.
Please don't worry.
Let's go in.

231
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:13,830
I'm sorry but I'm done for the day.

232
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,740
This early?

233
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:20,440
Yes, I have an afternoon surgery.
Then...

234
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:43,930
Hello.

235
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:45,760
Is this your first time here?

236
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:49,800
I'm here to see Dr. Pak Chan U.

237
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:52,000
Do you have an appointment?

238
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,040
No. He's my son.

239
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:59,340
What? Oh, my.
So, you're Dr. Pak Chan U's mother.

240
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:01,010
Yes.

241
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:07,780
Chan U left this important document at home.
I'm here to give this to him.

242
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:11,820
Is that so? Come with me.
I'll take you to Dr. Pak.

243
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:13,290
Thank you.

244
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:15,130
This way, please.

245
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:18,800
Hello, Mother.

246
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:21,360
Mother?

247
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:27,600
It's nice to meet you.
I am Sin I Jeong.

248
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,810
Who... ?

249
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:34,580
I like Dr. Pak Chan U very much.

250
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:39,720
No, I'm a patient who 
respects him very much.

251
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,550
What?

252
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,750
She's the Chairman's daughter.

253
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:46,690
She's a patient of Dr. Pak.

254
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:49,630
Is that so?

255
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:56,600
Mother, you're really beautiful.

256
00:21:56,600 --> 00:22:01,740
What?
Not really.

257
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:05,040
I was wondering why Dr. Pak 
is so handsome.

258
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,980
He took after you.

259
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:10,550
What are you saying?

260
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,220
You really, really leave a good impression.

261
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:16,420
Thank you.

262
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,060
Yes?

263
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,270
Chan U!

264
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:32,570
Mom, why are you here?

265
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:36,610
Here. You should have called a courier.

266
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:40,280
That's expensive.
It's faster this way.

267
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:44,680
Still...
You should have told me you were coming.

268
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:49,450
I want to check out the hospital
where my son works.

269
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:56,060
By the way, Chan U...
What's your relationship with
the Chairman's daughter?

270
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:57,530
What?

271
00:22:57,530 --> 00:23:01,570
I just met her.
She's so pretty.

272
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:10,010
Is she your girlfriend?
I think she likes you a lot.

273
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:12,940
What girlfriend?
No, she's not.

274
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:16,980
I can sense these things.
How can I not know?

275
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:19,180
It's really nothing.

276
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:27,620
There's really nothing going on?
Fine. I'll just take your word for it.

277
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:33,130
This room is really huge.
I like it.

278
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:38,270
My son is amazing.

279
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:50,380
What happened?
Did you meet Song Mi Ryeong?

280
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:56,990
Come on.
I'm dying to know, I can't do anything else.

281
00:23:56,990 --> 00:23:59,190
Did you meet?

282
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:01,130
We did.

283
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:03,590
Really? What did you talk about?

284
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:06,160
Hey. What will happen to you from now on?

285
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:10,200
What can happen?
Nothing will change.

286
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:16,810
How is that possible? Is this common?
You're an absolute Cinderella.

287
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:19,380
Cinderella?

288
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,900
Yes.

289
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:25,980
The codis are all wondering who 
her daughter is.

290
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:29,290
Everyone's so envious.

291
00:24:29,290 --> 00:24:32,710
To be honest, isn't this like hitting the lottery?

292
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,690
What did you say?

293
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:37,730
You know...
Think carefully about it.

294
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:41,770
Your life will totally change for the better.
It's just a matter of time.

295
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:44,560
Your mother will support you all the way.

296
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:45,890
You can continue to act.

297
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:49,840
Pak Chan Mi!
Stop it.

298
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,310
What?

299
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:53,140
How could you say that?

300
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:55,710
How could she be my mother?

301
00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:59,020
Why is she my mother?

302
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:01,590
Don't talk to me about Song Mi Ryeong again.

303
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:03,420
Nothing will change.

304
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:05,620
Try and say it one more time...

305
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:15,530
Who's that?

306
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:26,540
=The number you have dialed is unavailable...=

307
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:37,190
=The number you have dialed is unavailable...=

308
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:55,840
Mom!

309
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:57,980
Oh, you're here.

310
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:01,550
Where are you going?
I bought some iced desserts--

311
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:37,750
<i>Think carefully about it.
Your life will totally change for the better.
It's just a matter of time.</i>

312
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:41,420
<i>To be honest, isn't this like hitting the lottery?</i>

313
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,560
Sun Sin.

314
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:14,880
Sun Sin.
Let's talk for a moment.

315
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:16,870
I have nothing to say.

316
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:19,220
I've already said everything 
at the hospital.

317
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:20,690
Just for a moment.

318
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:21,950
Let me go!

319
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,630
Sun Sin.

320
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:26,980
I thought I told you not 
to appear before me again.

321
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:30,470
Stop being too emotional.

322
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:32,420
Let's have a serious chat.

323
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:35,560
There's a lot of things to clear up
between us.

324
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:40,510
I'm really sorry about the reporters.

325
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:42,010
I really didn't know.

326
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:44,310
I'm so sorry about that.

327
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:52,880
Anyway... Anyway, can we move to a quiet place?

328
00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:54,150
Listen to what I have to say.

329
00:27:54,170 --> 00:27:55,560
No, thanks.

330
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,240
I don't want to hear anything.

331
00:27:57,250 --> 00:28:00,450
After you said what you wanted,
you're not even going to listen to me?

332
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:02,370
Aren't you even curious about me?

333
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:04,460
How you and I separated...

334
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:07,560
What your father is like,
don't you want to know?

335
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:10,350
Yes, I don't want to hear them.

336
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:13,560
I'm not curious about them.
They're not important to me.

337
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,110
Why isn't that important?

338
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:19,050
Don't suddenly appear before me 
and act like a mother.

339
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:21,620
I only have one mother.

340
00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:25,290
Sun Sin.

341
00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:27,570
Let me say it again.

342
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:30,400
I don't want to see you.

343
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:35,360
So, please don't disturb me anymore.
I beg you!

344
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,040
Please.

345
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:41,960
Please go.

346
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,230
Boss, have you heard?

347
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:09,700
What?

348
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:12,640
Anything can happen in this world.

349
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,100
What do you mean?

350
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:15,570
Sun Sin is...

351
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:20,340
She's Song Mi Ryeong's daughter.

352
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:24,380
Then my father is Obama.

353
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:29,560
Isn't it funny, Boss?

354
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:32,550
Who said that?

355
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:36,380
I overheard the trainees 
talking about it over there.

356
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:37,960
It's hilarious, right?

357
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:40,900
It's the best joke I've heard these days.

358
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,870
Take care of this.

359
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,310
Yes.

360
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:24,370
Boss.

361
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:26,780
Have you been well, Sun Sin?

362
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:30,410
Yes.
Have you been well?

363
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:34,480
Can you come by for a moment?

364
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:37,360
There are still some things to settle.

365
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,210
What?

366
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,000
Mom!

367
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:02,750
You are still here?

368
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:07,980
Where have you been?
Is something wrong?

369
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:09,880
Nothing.

370
00:31:10,090 --> 00:31:14,330
Did you meet Sun Sin?

371
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:16,550
She didn't want to listen to me.

372
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,570
I just wanted to explain my side.
But she brushed me off.

373
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:20,550
How could she do that?

374
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:22,400
Calm down, Mom.

375
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:24,190
Come and have dinner with me.

376
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:27,250
Let's take a walk too.
You'll feel better afterwards.

377
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:30,890
Nevermind.
Carry on with your work.

378
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:33,210
Don't be like this, Mom.

379
00:31:33,210 --> 00:31:35,890
I can't.  I'm tired.
I need to rest.

380
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:52,550
Here.

381
00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:01,840
You said I need to settle some things.

382
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,310
What's this?

383
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:05,140
This is the settlement.

384
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:09,550
Eat what you need to eat,
fix what needs to be fixed, 
then leave.

385
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:16,550
How is it staying at home?
Happy that you're not working?

386
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:20,190
Yes, I am.

387
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:26,090
I'm hurt.
We're the only ones who miss you.

388
00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:29,550
Is that true?

389
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:30,690
I'm really hurt.

390
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:33,020
What's wrong with you?

391
00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:45,520
What's that?

392
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:46,980
A gift.

393
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:51,550
I wanted to give this to you on your birthday.
I guess I'm quite impatient.

394
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,430
Thank you.

395
00:33:00,930 --> 00:33:04,970
Is it very hard?

396
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:10,110
You heard?

397
00:33:17,810 --> 00:33:25,560
Sun Sin, it's much better to confront things 
rather than hide and leave it unresolved.

398
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:31,260
This way, you and your family
will feel better.

399
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:36,530
If things get tough, it's better to vent 
your anger  from time to time.

400
00:33:36,530 --> 00:33:38,370
Get furious.

401
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,660
Then, shall I vent it on you?

402
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:49,380
Hurry, eat.
The food's getting cold.

403
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:51,950
When you're stressed,
eating is the best.

404
00:33:53,050 --> 00:33:54,880
Thank you.

405
00:33:57,450 --> 00:34:00,760
Sir, how could such a thing happen?

406
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:03,120
It's jackpot.

407
00:34:03,130 --> 00:34:05,190
Sun Sin's really lucky.

408
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,860
She's a Cinderella.

409
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:09,930
Goodness.
This should have happened earlier.
There's just too many offers.

410
00:34:09,930 --> 00:34:13,240
There are even requests to act with Song Mi Ryeong.
She's really popular.

411
00:34:13,270 --> 00:34:14,540
What should we do?

412
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:16,170
Shall I schedule it?

413
00:34:16,170 --> 00:34:18,270
Schedule.
What schedule?

414
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,740
Absolutely not.
Decline them.

415
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,750
What's wrong with you?

416
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:26,670
Where can you find 
such a nice turn of events?

417
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:28,340
This is the perfect chance.

418
00:34:28,370 --> 00:34:31,010
Sun Sin is famous,
Miss Song is famous.

419
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:33,550
This is such an opportunity for Sun Sin.

420
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:35,550
She can be famous.
Why must we miss this?

421
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:37,090
No!

422
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:41,550
You should never tell Sun Sin about this.
Understand?

423
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:14,160
Jun Ho.

424
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:24,070
You are getting off work now?

425
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:30,310
Come and drink with me, will you?

426
00:35:31,050 --> 00:35:34,350
I'm going to see Miss Song.

427
00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:39,490
I was just there.

428
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:46,100
She's not feeling well.

429
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:50,500
Jun Ho.

430
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:56,370
Can you comfort me today?

431
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:05,550
I'm a little depressed today.

432
00:36:06,650 --> 00:36:14,360
Teacher Song is suffering a lot
because of someone.

433
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:18,400
You must be too.

434
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:23,900
I feel really sensitive.

435
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:29,410
Do you understand how I feel?

436
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:33,810
Let's go in.

437
00:36:33,810 --> 00:36:37,480
Have a drink with me.

438
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:45,560
I'll take a rain check.

439
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:48,490
I'm quite busy today.

440
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:05,380
Yeon A.

441
00:37:13,450 --> 00:37:15,650
Who's this?

442
00:37:17,850 --> 00:37:21,160
We meet again here.

443
00:37:23,730 --> 00:37:28,500
Oppa, I have a sister now.

444
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:34,000
Yeon A.
You're drunk.

445
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:38,040
No, I'm not drunk.

446
00:37:40,610 --> 00:37:43,180
Sun Sin...

447
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:47,580
Forgive Mom already.

448
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:54,190
Do you know how worried she is now?

449
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:02,270
Sorry, I'll go ahead.

450
00:38:02,270 --> 00:38:05,570
See you again, Boss.

451
00:38:30,530 --> 00:38:33,100
Aren't you going to answer that?

452
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:34,560
Yes.

453
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:37,500
It's a spam.

454
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,800
Isn't that from a man?

455
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,010
No, it's not.

456
00:38:43,010 --> 00:38:45,940
Yes, do you have time for this now?

457
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:49,610
Your family must be in such 
a turmoil these days.

458
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:51,450
Yes.

459
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:54,380
What are we going to do about your mother?

460
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:57,690
Take better care of her.

461
00:38:57,690 --> 00:38:59,520
Yes.

462
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,560
Oh.

463
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:07,230
Did Chan U mention anything 
about having a girlfriend?

464
00:39:07,450 --> 00:39:09,050
Pardon?

465
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:14,080
It looks like Chan U's dating 
the Chairman's daughter.

466
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:19,510
Although I thought nothing of it when 
the Chairman invited him to his home,

467
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:22,650
looks like it's not like that at all.

468
00:39:22,650 --> 00:39:23,750
Come to think of it,

469
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:26,680
I think he invited him over
to set him up with his daughter.

470
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:28,180
Chan U didn't even say anything.

471
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:30,810
I even thought there was 
a problem with the girl.

472
00:39:30,830 --> 00:39:35,320
I saw her. She's so pretty and cute.

473
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:37,330
You saw her?

474
00:39:37,330 --> 00:39:40,260
I met her by chance at the hospital this morning.

475
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:44,670
She keeps coming to the hospital.
Looks like they're really dating.

476
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,870
Hey, Yu Sin.

477
00:39:46,870 --> 00:39:49,070
Find yourself a man
and get married too.

478
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:52,010
Your mother's pretty down lately.

479
00:39:52,010 --> 00:39:54,950
With what happened to Hye Sin and Sun Sin...

480
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:58,980
Wouldn't it be nice if you could 
lift her spirits up a bit?

481
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:01,550
Stop dating around.

482
00:40:01,550 --> 00:40:05,590
Find a reliable guy and get married.
Get married immediately.

483
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:09,630
Don't be too picky.

484
00:40:12,930 --> 00:40:15,500
Everything's so expensive these days.

485
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:16,230
Oh, my.

486
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:18,800
It's heavy, Gil Ja.
Let me.

487
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:21,370
Thanks.

488
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:25,040
Why are you here?

489
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:28,350
Ah, really...

490
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:30,910
You're done, right?
Let's go, Mom.

491
00:40:30,910 --> 00:40:35,320
What's wrong with you? Go home.
I still have to salt the kimchi.

492
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:38,260
Why do you have to salt the kimchi?

493
00:40:41,830 --> 00:40:43,140
Let's go, Mom.

494
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:45,230
I told you to go ahead.

495
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:46,930
Yu Sin.

496
00:40:47,430 --> 00:40:52,570
I heard. Congrats.
You nabbed the Chairman's daughter.
Don't let go.

497
00:40:52,570 --> 00:40:54,770
I should start dating too.

498
00:40:54,770 --> 00:40:58,070
I just broke up with my boyfriend too.

499
00:40:58,070 --> 00:40:59,910
What's wrong with you?

500
00:40:59,910 --> 00:41:01,380
What did I do?

501
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:03,580
How could you raise your voice 
in front of ajumma?

502
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:05,420
What did Chan U do?

503
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:07,250
Apologize to them.

504
00:41:07,250 --> 00:41:10,550
Ajumma, I'm fine.

505
00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:14,220
Okay. I'm sorry.

506
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:18,630
I'l go ahead.
Mom, you can live here forever.

507
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:21,570
Yu Sin.

508
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:25,600
Why did she stalk out?

509
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:27,800
Gil Ja, I have to go home.

510
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:28,170
Yes, yes.

511
00:41:28,170 --> 00:41:29,270
Go home.

512
00:41:29,270 --> 00:41:33,310
She's even shouting at her mom.
It must be serious.

513
00:41:33,310 --> 00:41:34,780
Go home.

514
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:36,980
Give this to me.
Okay, go.

515
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:40,650
Oh, gosh.

516
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:45,060
What did you say to Yu Sin?

517
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:46,890
What did I do?

518
00:41:46,890 --> 00:41:50,560
How could she get more and more annoying?

519
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,400
You...

520
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:56,430
Imagine how she bad feels these days.

521
00:42:06,890 --> 00:42:08,910
What's wrong with you?

522
00:42:08,910 --> 00:42:11,480
Are you deliberately giving me a hard time?

523
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:12,580
What did I do?

524
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:14,780
You made a scene back there.
What does that make me?

525
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:17,160
Just stop working there.

526
00:42:17,170 --> 00:42:18,120
Yu Sin.

527
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:20,660
Why? Are you going to hit me again?

528
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:22,140
I'm sorry about that.

529
00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:22,890
However...

530
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:24,840
However what?

531
00:42:25,430 --> 00:42:28,370
Have you ever considered my feelings?

532
00:42:28,370 --> 00:42:30,430
It's always Sun Sin, Sun Sin.

533
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:31,300
When did I do that?

534
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:32,720
You do!

535
00:42:32,730 --> 00:42:36,150
After knowing she was dad's daughter,
you still worry about her.

536
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:37,790
Imagine how she's feeling.

537
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:40,480
How confused and helpless she must be.

538
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:43,340
You are her big sister.
Can't you understand her for a moment?

539
00:42:43,370 --> 00:42:45,250
Don't you know how pitiful she is?

540
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:47,150
How is she pitiful?

541
00:42:47,170 --> 00:42:49,110
Don't you hate her too?

542
00:42:49,130 --> 00:42:51,860
I know you hate her so please don't 
pretend otherwise and act all mighty.

543
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:53,150
All mighty?

544
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:54,040
That's right!

545
00:42:54,070 --> 00:42:56,230
She's the product of dad's affair.

546
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:57,730
How can you pretend to feel sorry for her?

547
00:42:57,730 --> 00:42:59,130
Don't you hate her?

548
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:00,760
Go and have your own child too.

549
00:43:00,770 --> 00:43:02,750
Do you think you can hate
just because you want to?

550
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:04,920
That's what a parent is.
That's what a child is.

551
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:07,120
Be honest, Mom.

552
00:43:07,130 --> 00:43:09,110
Child? What child?

553
00:43:09,110 --> 00:43:10,570
She's now grown up.

554
00:43:10,570 --> 00:43:13,060
Can't you see how awesome her mother is?

555
00:43:13,070 --> 00:43:14,810
But you said you don't hate her.

556
00:43:14,830 --> 00:43:18,280
I don't hate her.
Why should I?

557
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:21,220
I know!
I know how great you are.

558
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:24,890
I know you're great but not like this.

559
00:43:24,890 --> 00:43:27,460
Fine, I lose!

560
00:43:28,190 --> 00:43:30,390
But, Mom...

561
00:43:30,390 --> 00:43:31,860
Don't forget this...

562
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:33,330
I'm also your daughter.

563
00:43:33,330 --> 00:43:38,470
I'm your daughter who worries 
about you more than anyone.

564
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:52,050
Oh, my.
Why is it so noisy?

565
00:43:52,050 --> 00:43:55,350
What happened?
What did she do again?

566
00:43:55,350 --> 00:43:58,290
Nothing, Granny.

567
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:17,010
Eonni.

568
00:44:18,110 --> 00:44:21,040
Don't claim to know
how I'm feeling right now.

569
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:23,980
Do you know how much 
I've hated you since I was little?

570
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:28,390
They said you almost died on the side-road.
Dad and Mom were always worried about you.

571
00:44:28,390 --> 00:44:30,950
As their real daughter, 
I had to keep giving in to you.

572
00:44:30,950 --> 00:44:34,260
I never had their love to myself.

573
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:38,300
But you're actually dad's daughter.

574
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:40,130
Does that make any sense?

575
00:44:40,130 --> 00:44:42,700
You're dad's daughter.

576
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:43,800
Then, what about me?

577
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:46,740
What's the use of yielding 
to you all those times?

578
00:44:49,310 --> 00:44:55,180
Yes. Just as Mom said, it's not your fault.
I know that.

579
00:44:55,180 --> 00:44:59,220
But I'm really having a hard time 
whenever I see you.

580
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:02,890
I can't accept it no matter how hard I try.
What can I do?

581
00:45:03,250 --> 00:45:06,190
I can't help it even if they call me selfish.

582
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:28,580
Do you have a reservation?

583
00:45:28,580 --> 00:45:30,050
Ah, well...

584
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:33,350
Hyeongnim.

585
00:45:33,350 --> 00:45:35,920
He's over there.

586
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:38,490
- Hello.
- Yes.

587
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:47,300
I thought we're just meeting for a while.
Why are we in such a nice place?

588
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:50,970
I wanted to do this all along.
I just didn't get the chance.

589
00:45:50,970 --> 00:45:53,170
I see.
Thanks, then.

590
00:45:55,010 --> 00:45:57,210
Have you been busy lately?

591
00:45:57,210 --> 00:45:59,410
Just the same.

592
00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:04,550
Hey. How did things turn out like this?

593
00:46:04,550 --> 00:46:06,380
Couldn't you just have kept that a secret?

594
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:08,590
Must you really do that?

595
00:46:08,590 --> 00:46:13,360
Hyeongnim...
Anyway, there are no secrets in this world.

596
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:16,660
Tell her this.
She can't live like that.

597
00:46:16,660 --> 00:46:21,430
She used her daughter to elicit compassion.
She'll get punished.

598
00:46:22,530 --> 00:46:24,730
What are you saying?

599
00:46:24,730 --> 00:46:26,200
That's too much.

600
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:30,610
Don't you agree?
She held the press conference
precisely because of that.

601
00:46:31,710 --> 00:46:34,280
Please leave her family alone.

602
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:37,580
Do you know how much they've suffered 
after Chang Hun hyeong passed away?

603
00:46:37,580 --> 00:46:39,780
Then this happened.

604
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:43,820
Sister-in-law is close to collapsing.

605
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:50,280
Hyeongnim, are they suffering a lot
since Chang Hun hyeong died?

606
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:52,260
Isn't that obvious?

607
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:56,300
The head of the family suddenly died.

608
00:46:56,300 --> 00:47:00,340
Goodness.
There were no witnesses.

609
00:47:00,340 --> 00:47:02,170
They can't even get compensation.

610
00:47:02,170 --> 00:47:05,110
They are barely getting by.

611
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:13,550
By the way, Il Do.

612
00:47:13,550 --> 00:47:17,590
I'm curious about one thing.

613
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:26,400
Is Sun Sin really Chang Hun hyeong's daughter?

614
00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:30,430
I don't understand what you mean.

615
00:47:30,430 --> 00:47:33,740
Come on...
Tell me the truth.

616
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:36,310
Then, whose child could she be?

617
00:47:37,410 --> 00:47:40,710
It has always been Chang Hun for Nunim.

618
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:42,550
Is that so?

619
00:47:44,750 --> 00:47:46,580
Stop talking nonsense.
Let's just drink.

620
00:47:46,580 --> 00:47:48,420
- Come.
- Yes.

621
00:48:09,340 --> 00:48:12,280
<i>Don't suddenly appear before me
and act like a mother.</i>

622
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:14,840
<i>I only have one mother.</i>

623
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:17,780
<i>Sun Sin...</i>

624
00:48:17,780 --> 00:48:22,920
<i>Let me tell you this again.
I don't want to see you.</i>

625
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:27,690
<i>So, please don't appear before me again.
I beg you.</i>

626
00:48:27,690 --> 00:48:29,890
<i>Please.</i>

627
00:48:46,410 --> 00:48:48,980
Nunim, are you drinking again?

628
00:48:49,350 --> 00:48:51,920
You'll become an alcoholic like this.

629
00:48:57,050 --> 00:48:59,260
Are you that worried about her?

630
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:05,000
In that case, just give them some money
to make you feel better.

631
00:49:08,060 --> 00:49:14,300
I heard her family's suffering a lot 
after Chang Hun hyeong died.

632
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:16,870
If you go and help them,

633
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:19,810
I reckon this will be best
for everyone concerned.

634
00:49:19,810 --> 00:49:22,750
This way, they won't say anything bad against us.

635
00:49:22,750 --> 00:49:25,680
You will also feel better.

636
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:28,250
If you don't want to get her back,
give them what's appropriate.

637
00:49:28,250 --> 00:49:30,450
Then continue living like this.

638
00:49:30,450 --> 00:49:32,290
This is the best solution for everyone.

639
00:49:32,290 --> 00:49:35,960
You were also very upset because 
of Chang Hun, weren't you?

640
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:38,530
This is the only way to alleviate your guilt.

641
00:49:41,460 --> 00:49:45,870
Guilt?
What guilt?

642
00:49:45,870 --> 00:49:48,440
Did I do anything wrong?

643
00:49:51,010 --> 00:49:53,940
Did I kill Chang Hun oppa?

644
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:56,510
What are you talking about?

645
00:49:56,510 --> 00:50:02,020
Furthermore,
did I leave my child to them?

646
00:50:02,020 --> 00:50:04,590
Did I beg them to raise her?

647
00:50:04,590 --> 00:50:07,890
Why should I feel guilty?

648
00:50:08,260 --> 00:50:10,830
I didn't do anything wrong.

649
00:50:10,830 --> 00:50:13,400
No.
What I meant was...

650
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:17,800
I... want to bring her back and live with her.

651
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:19,270
Nunim.

652
00:50:19,270 --> 00:50:22,570
Why? I want to live with my daughter.

653
00:50:22,570 --> 00:50:25,140
Is that wrong?

654
00:50:26,980 --> 00:50:30,280
That old lady who disregarded me.

655
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:33,580
I bet she's abusing my daughter.

656
00:50:33,580 --> 00:50:36,150
The daughters of that family,

657
00:50:36,150 --> 00:50:40,920
will they treat her the same way after 
finding out that she's my daughter?

658
00:50:41,290 --> 00:50:45,330
It's a different story if I didn't know.
Now that I know, how can I stay still
and do nothing?

659
00:50:45,330 --> 00:50:47,160
Nunim.

660
00:50:48,270 --> 00:50:54,140
I will take her back and give her everything.

661
00:50:54,140 --> 00:50:56,710
People will envy her.

662
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:59,640
Anyway, everyone knows now.

663
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:04,050
My daughter...
Song Mi Ryeong's daughter...

664
00:51:04,050 --> 00:51:07,350
can't stay in that wretched house any longer.

665
00:51:07,350 --> 00:51:10,290
My pride won't allow that.

666
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:36,710
Are you going somewhere?

667
00:51:36,710 --> 00:51:39,650
Prepare the car.
I'm going to Sun Sin's house.

668
00:51:39,650 --> 00:51:41,120
What?

669
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:00,200
What are you doing?

670
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:03,510
Writing my CV.
I have to find a job soon.

671
00:52:03,510 --> 00:52:06,810
Don't be in such a hurry.
Take your time to think about it.

672
00:52:06,810 --> 00:52:10,110
Don't worry, Eonni.
I'll get employed right away,

673
00:52:10,110 --> 00:52:13,780
then buy U Ju some delicious food
and give you pocket money.

674
00:52:13,780 --> 00:52:17,090
All right, then.
Good luck.

675
00:52:17,090 --> 00:52:18,920
Thanks, Eonni.

676
00:52:24,790 --> 00:52:26,260
What are you doing, Granny?

677
00:52:26,260 --> 00:52:28,100
Where are you going?

678
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:30,670
I'm going to submit my resume 
to different companies.

679
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:42,050
Have you met your real mother?
Didn't she contact you?

680
00:52:42,780 --> 00:52:46,080
Oh... No, she didn't.

681
00:52:46,820 --> 00:52:50,120
If she wants to meet you,
tell me, okay?

682
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:52,690
I'll go with you.

683
00:52:53,790 --> 00:52:55,260
Yes.

684
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:59,300
Okay. Go on.

685
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:01,130
Then, I'm going.

686
00:53:01,130 --> 00:53:02,970
Hang on.

687
00:53:09,210 --> 00:53:12,510
This...
Buy your lunch with this.

688
00:53:12,510 --> 00:53:13,610
No, Granny.
It's okay.

689
00:53:13,610 --> 00:53:16,550
Take it.

690
00:53:27,190 --> 00:53:31,230
Why isn't there a comfortable day?

691
00:53:34,530 --> 00:53:37,000
Granny, do you want to go out with me?

692
00:53:37,100 --> 00:53:39,300
Where are we going?

693
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:41,500
Let's have lunch together.

694
00:53:42,550 --> 00:53:44,440
There is no need.

695
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:48,230
There's a really nice cold noodles restaurant nearby.

696
00:53:48,250 --> 00:53:51,410
When you're feeling blue,
eating that will surely lift your spirits up.

697
00:53:51,410 --> 00:53:52,880
Let's go, Granny.

698
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:54,350
Don't worry, it's okay.

699
00:53:54,350 --> 00:53:56,190
I can't chew.

700
00:53:56,190 --> 00:53:58,390
I'll cut the noodles for you.

701
00:53:58,390 --> 00:54:00,220
Come on, Granny.

702
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:04,630
My goodness.
My granny's waist is so small.

703
00:54:04,630 --> 00:54:07,200
You can join the Miss Korea contest.

704
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:09,030
Come on, let's go.

705
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:47,570
Wait here.

706
00:54:52,710 --> 00:54:54,540
What are you doing here?

707
00:54:56,380 --> 00:54:59,680
I was in a hurry last time.
I didn't make a proper greeting.

708
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:01,520
I'm here to do that now.

709
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:04,090
Are you the eldest daughter?

710
00:55:04,820 --> 00:55:06,290
Yes, I am.

711
00:55:06,290 --> 00:55:08,860
Is your mother here?

712
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:17,670
I heard from Chan U.
It's already in the newspapers.

713
00:55:17,670 --> 00:55:20,600
They call her aspiring actress, Miss A.

714
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:23,170
The reporters are quick.

715
00:55:23,170 --> 00:55:26,110
They even know what Sun Sin is doing.

716
00:55:27,210 --> 00:55:31,980
They are even saying,  
"Like mother, like daughter."

717
00:55:33,450 --> 00:55:38,590
I really don't know why everyone's saying that.

718
00:55:42,260 --> 00:55:44,090
Yes, Hye Sin.

719
00:55:44,090 --> 00:55:50,330
Mom. You have a guest at home.

720
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:52,900
Song Mi Ryeong.

721
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:55,840
Who? Song Mi Ryeong?

722
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:57,670
Song Mi Ryeong's there?

723
00:55:57,670 --> 00:55:58,780
Why is she there?

724
00:55:58,780 --> 00:56:02,080
I don't know, either.
Come home first, Mom.

725
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:08,690
Please have some tea.

726
00:56:09,420 --> 00:56:15,660
Thank you.
But, where is your mother?

727
00:56:15,660 --> 00:56:17,490
She went to work.

728
00:56:17,490 --> 00:56:19,700
What kind of work?

729
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:22,270
She's helping out at a friend's shop.

730
00:56:22,270 --> 00:56:25,570
Shop?
What kind of shop?

731
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:28,870
Chicken shop.

732
00:56:32,910 --> 00:56:39,150
I'm curious about something.
Who picked Sun Sin's name?

733
00:56:39,150 --> 00:56:41,350
Why do you want to know?

734
00:56:43,190 --> 00:56:46,860
There are plenty of nice names.
Why must it be...

735
00:56:47,590 --> 00:56:51,630
Oh, yeah.
Where is Sun Sin's room?

736
00:56:51,630 --> 00:56:53,100
What?

737
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:08,880
She shares a room with her sister?

738
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:10,350
Yes.

739
00:57:12,550 --> 00:57:14,410
Can I open that?

740
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:15,970
Excuse me.

741
00:57:18,330 --> 00:57:23,190
I'm curious.
What my daughter wears,
what her room looks like.

742
00:57:23,190 --> 00:57:25,400
I want to know all that.

743
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:39,710
Does she share a wardrobe with her sister too?

744
00:57:39,710 --> 00:57:41,540
What are you doing right now?

745
00:57:41,540 --> 00:57:44,480
No, forget it.
Let's go down.

746
00:57:54,390 --> 00:57:56,590
Is there a problem?

747
00:57:56,960 --> 00:57:59,160
How have you been?

748
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:12,380
For all those times you've raised my child,
you've worked really hard.

749
00:58:12,380 --> 00:58:16,410
I've gotten over those negative feelings.

750
00:58:16,780 --> 00:58:19,350
Let's get along well from now on.

751
00:58:19,350 --> 00:58:24,850
I've already prepared to do everything for Sun Sin.

752
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:31,830
Those times I ignored my motherly duties,
I'm now ready to assume it.

753
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:34,760
What are you saying?

754
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:39,900
She's going to continue studying
and pursue her acting career.

755
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:44,310
I will do everything I can for her.

756
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:53,850
That way, I can pay back everything 
I owed my daughter.
Isn't that a mother's duty?

757
00:58:53,850 --> 00:58:56,420
What?

758
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:10,370
What's that?

759
00:59:10,370 --> 00:59:14,770
Thank you for raising my daughter.

760
00:59:14,770 --> 00:59:18,440
It's a token of my appreciation.
Please take it.

761
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:25,780
I'm going to take her 
because she's my daughter.

762
01:00:01,750 --> 01:00:04,690
-=Next Episode Preview.=-

763
01:00:04,690 --> 01:00:07,620
You abandoned her back then.
Now you want to come back as a mother?

764
01:00:07,620 --> 01:00:08,730
Abandon her?

765
01:00:08,730 --> 01:00:10,190
It was Chang Hun oppa who took her away.

766
01:00:10,190 --> 01:00:13,130
She said she wants to take you. 
She said she'll take you and raise you.

767
01:00:13,130 --> 01:00:14,600
Let Sun Sin go, Mom.

768
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:17,530
We absolutely can't Sun Sin sent away.

769
01:00:17,530 --> 01:00:19,000
Let's tell the families.

770
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,100
What are you doing?

771
01:00:20,100 --> 01:00:23,040
I want to marry you.
Let's get married.

772
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:26,710
I know your heart.
Try to be honest to yourself.

773
01:00:26,710 --> 01:00:29,280
Promise me.
You won't go find my mother anymore.

774
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:32,580
Can't you open your heart a bit for me?

775
01:00:32,580 --> 01:00:34,050
No matter what you say,
I'm still your mother.

776
01:00:34,050 --> 01:00:35,890
Mother.
