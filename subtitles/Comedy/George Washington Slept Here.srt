{765}{867}Deep in the heart of Africa|is a place no man has ever entered.
{871}{965}A place that belongs to the lion,|the elephant and the ape.
{969}{1029}A place known as the Bukuvu.
{1033}{1123}Travellers flying overhead|can only glimpse at its many marvels:
{1127}{1181}its sparkling rivers...
{1185}{1284}its lush veldts,|its billowy cloud formations...
{1288}{1382}and its hidden mountains.
{1420}{1460}- Never fear, my friends.|- George!|- George!
{1464}{1509}- All was not lost.|- George!
{1513}{1611}Scraped and boo-booed,|they searched high and low...
{1615}{1707}but they never recovered|their most precious cargo.
{1871}{1922}George, George|George of the Jungle
{1926}{1975}Strong as he can be
{2031}{2083}Watch out for that tree
{2087}{2135}George, George|George of the Jungle
{2139}{2195}Lives a life that's free
{2248}{2296}Watch out for that tree
{2300}{2351}When he gets in a scrape|he makes his escape
{2355}{2425}With help from his friend|an ape named Ape
{2429}{2483}And his elephant Shep|can fetch a log
{2487}{2555}He's man's best friend|He's George's dog
{2559}{2623}He's George, George|George of the Jungle
{2627}{2673}Strong as he can be
{2733}{2781}Watch out for that tree
{2785}{2830}Hear him holler|swing and sing
{2834}{2891}All the animals come|to the jungle king
{2895}{2938}George, George|George of the Jungle
{2942}{2990}George, George|George of the Jungle
{2994}{3048}So grab a vine|and swing in time
{3052}{3116}If you smack a tree|just pay no mind
{3120}{3185}Like George, George|George of the Jungle
{3189}{3237}Strong as he can be
{3295}{3342}Watch out for that tree
{3346}{3452}Watch out for that--|Bang! Ooh! Tree
{3544}{3592}George, George|George of the Jungle
{3596}{3644}Watch out for that tree
{3673}{3725}Twenty-five years later,|the bouncing baby boy...
{3729}{3819}has grown into|a swinging jungle king.
{3823}{3871}He is swift. He is strong.
{3875}{3929}He is sure. He is smart.
{3977}{4025}He is unconscious.
{4029}{4082}Meanwhile, 43 vines away...
{4086}{4168}George's kingdom was being threatened|by a terrifying intruder.
{4172}{4216}Hi, everybody. Me again.
{4220}{4298}Third day in Mbwebwe.|Look at this incredible--
{4302}{4398}- Banyan tree.|- Banyan tree. And look what's in it.
{4524}{4588}Could you die?
{4592}{4640}And over here...
{4644}{4721}is the outhouse, which you|don't want to see, believe me.
{4725}{4793}By the way, Betsy, thank you so|much for those moist towelettes.
{4797}{4851}They've been a lifesaver.
{4855}{4940}And these are the wonderful porters.|Wave, guys.
{4944}{4999}And this is our guide, Mr Kwame.
{5003}{5078}Without him, we would be lost.|Hi.
{5130}{5194}This is great.
{5198}{5296}- And this is Lyle.|- Hello, Bujumburans.
{5300}{5395}- What are you doing here?|- What kind of greeting is that|to give your fiance?
{5399}{5476}- Aren't you happy to see me?|- Yeah, of course I am.
{5535}{5585}The jungle loves you.|You're beautiful.
{5589}{5675}- How did you find me?|- Well, I just hired the two|best trackers in the business.
{5719}{5812}Ah, I'm chafing, Max.|Ah, yeah, I'm chafing big time.
{5816}{5908}Didn't I tell you not to wear 20 pounds|of black leather in the jungle?
{5912}{5960}- Didn't I tell ya?|- Ah.
{5964}{6029}Cotton, I said. Cotton breathes.
{6033}{6098}Take my things to the lady's tent|and shake a leg.
{6187}{6277}Later that night, Lyle Van de Groot|lost no time in making arrangements...
{6281}{6366}-to whisk his wayward fiancee back home.|-All right, I'll take it, I'll take it.
{6370}{6452}Nairobi Hilton.|They can airlift us there in two hours.
{6456}{6501}Pillows, okay?
{6505}{6579}Wait a second. I'm losing you.|Bad reception here.
{6583}{6642}Okay, I've got you back.|No, wait! I'm losing you!
{6646}{6710}My batteries are dead!|No! Doody!
{6713}{6759}I don't want to go anyway, Lyle.|Tomorrow we're gonna....
{6763}{6861}climb the mountain where the big apes|are. Don't you wanna see them?
{6865}{6999}Only if they can shake a good gin|martini without bruising it. Hiyo!
{7003}{7098}Me and Thor here would be happy|to help you and the lady up|the mountain, Mr Van de Groot.
{7102}{7181}- Yeah.|- With Mr Kwame leading the way,|of course.
{7187}{7243}If you don't mind me saying so,|the apes...
{7247}{7357}are supposed to be a fascinating sight,|especially that white ape.
{7361}{7425}White ape? What's that?
{7428}{7527}Ask Mr Kwame.|I bet he can tell you.
{7531}{7649}- It is only a native legend.|- Could you please tell us?
{7686}{7746}The people say he is|over seven feet tall...
{7750}{7805}with the strength of a lion.
{7809}{7868}When the moon is full|and the air is sweet...
{7872}{7923}he wanders alone|through the jungle...
{7927}{8037}piercing the silence of the valley|with his mournful call.
{8041}{8111}Now, some say he is|thirsty for blood.
{8115}{8234}Others say he is calling|for the mate that he longs for...
{8238}{8294}but will never find.
{8298}{8405}By day, he rules the entire Bukuvu|from the top of the mountain.
{8409}{8457}But by night--
{8461}{8541}He and Bigfoot run the candy counter|at the Bukuvu Cineplex.
{8545}{8585}Now playing on all 14 screens:
{8589}{8640}Planet of the Apes.
{8729}{8840}Bigfoot? Max, that'd be worth|a lot more than any white--
{8844}{8929}- Ursula, what are we doing here?|- Lyle, I came all this way--
{8933}{9008}Okay, okay.|The things I do for you.
{9012}{9083}Looks like we're on, fellows.
{9087}{9142}As the sun rose|over Ape Mountain...
{9146}{9245}its agitated inhabitants sent an urgent|message to George by bongo-gram...
{9249}{9324}warning the jungle king that|intruders were close afoot.
{9328}{9376}Ooh. Lyle, listen.|What was that?
{9380}{9449}Could be the mating call|of the white ape.
{9453}{9508}Huh. White ape.|Sounds like a drink.
{9512}{9586}Uh, yes, bartender. I'll have|two Black Russians and a white ape.
{9590}{9665}A drink the venal Van de Groot|would be begging to imbibe...
{9669}{9761}if he only knew how near the white ape|was at that very moment...
{9765}{9839}flying through the foliage,|surveying the scenery, cruising in...
{9843}{9969}for a closer look and swinging on|through the trees with effortless ease.
{9973}{9996}Ow!
{10040}{10117}And so, onward and upward|the tired trekkers trudged...
{10121}{10188}on feverish footsies|over perilous paths.
{10192}{10292}When they finally beheld the mighty|Ape Mountain, they reacted with awe.
{10296}{10427}- Aww.|- I said "awe." A-W-E.
{10431}{10490}- Ooh!|- That's better.
{10494}{10591}Single file on the bridge.|Step very cautiously.
{10595}{10694}It is full of rotten planks.|One false move, you could fall over.
{10698}{10790}Then you will have|a very long time to wave goodbye.
{10794}{10858}Don't you worry, peanut.|I was on a bridge like this in Maui.
{10862}{10912}It was steady as a rock.|See?
{10916}{10975}Hey! S-Stop! Stop that!|Stop that! What th--
{10979}{11013}Yee-haw!
{11059}{11136}- I got you.|- No!
{11229}{11287}Don't worry.|Nobody dies in this story.
{11332}{11382}They just get|really big boo-boos.
{11386}{11443}What did I tell you?
{11447}{11526}You know, they shouldn't let|inexperienced guides|like that on these treks.
{11704}{11772}Did you see the look|that guy just gave me?
{11776}{11840}Probably saying I'm the biggest jerk|they've ever seen in their lives.
{11843}{11899}Probably trying to think|of something evil to do to me.
{12107}{12165}If they turn on us,|we're never gonna get home.
{12169}{12274}It's up to me to make the peace.|I'm going in.
{12278}{12344}Gentlemen. Cigar, cigarette?
{12348}{12423}Okay, gifts from America.
{12427}{12495}- Hey, hey.|- I give you a cigar,|you give me some of your lands.
{12499}{12590}All right.|A first contact has been made.
{12594}{12667}Ready, aim--
{12736}{12810}There you go, my man. Huh?
{12814}{12866}You like magic fire? Do ya?
{12870}{12934}Well, get a load of this.
{12990}{13061}There you go. Magic picture.
{13065}{13120}Yet another gift from America.|Here you go.
{13124}{13185}You're welcome.
{13306}{13370}Thirty-five millimetre.
{13595}{13629}Translation, please.
{13633}{13682}He says that he likes|your magic pictures...
{13686}{13774}but he prefers the resolution of|the Leica 35 millimetre transparencies.
{13778}{13882}He also says your lens is dirty, but he|has the equipment to clean it for you.
{13961}{14056}Well, tell him to clean this|while he's at it.
{14060}{14103}- Come on, let's go.|- Where?
{14107}{14177}Find you an ape, so we|can get the heck outta here.
{14181}{14272}Lyle, we can't go into the jungle alone.|We could get lost out here.
{14276}{14311}It's my job to get you|what you want.
{14315}{14373}You want a double decaf|latte with mocha sprinkles...
{14377}{14439}you will get a double decaf|latte with mocha sprinkles.
{14443}{14520}You want a white ape,|I'll get you a white ape.
{14524}{14583}Here, monkey, monkey, monkey.
{14587}{14657}Here, gorilla, gorilla.|Come on.
{14764}{14845}- Don't move.|- You mean I actually found one?|It worked?
{15184}{15272}- God, that scared me.|- Scared me, too.
{15431}{15499}I'm gonna go get help.|You wait here.
{15917}{15972}Oh, no.
{16941}{17021}Here, kitty, kitty,|kitty, kitty, kitty.
{17460}{17512}When lion brush last?
{17556}{17647}Don't tickle.|Don't ti-- No--
{17959}{18047}Rubber tree always good for clothesline.|Upsy, kitty.
{18320}{18384}George not even trying hard.
{18523}{18636}Flying pile driver.|Havin' some fun now.
{18640}{18702}Bad kitty!
{19124}{19194}- That close one, huh?|- Watch out for that tree!
{19219}{19249}Huh?
{19363}{19420}Oops.
{19515}{19570}Funny-looking fella.
{19772}{19822}White ape.
{19859}{19941}Y-- Y-- U-Ursula!|Ursu-- Wha--
{20097}{20155}Ursula, I found your scrunchie.
{20880}{20940}Go away!
{20998}{21053}It was horrible.
{21057}{21141}It was-- 400-pound|white ape man.
{21145}{21256}The white ape|has my girlfriend.
{21260}{21367}I held him off as long as I could.|Blood everywhere.
{21371}{21436}The white ape-- my girlfriend.
{21440}{21512}He-- He weighs 400 pounds.
{21516}{21598}The white ape got my girlfriend!|The white ape got--
{21602}{21674}Help! Help! Man needs help!
{21999}{22059}After a night|of feverish fantasies...
{22063}{22139}the perfectly permed heiress,|Ursula Stanhope...
{22143}{22258}awoke to the melodious music of the|Bukuvu bird life, and found herself...
{22262}{22345}venturing forth in search|of that defender of the innocent...
{22349}{22435}protector of the weak,|and all-around good guy...
{22439}{22491}George of the Jungle.
{22553}{22629}But that's not|who she saw first.
{22633}{22677}What!
{22765}{22827}Get away! Get away!|Get away!
{23125}{23228}- Hello. Oop!|- Oh, dear.
{23312}{23380}Feeling better, fella?
{23384}{23449}Okay. It's that dream, then.
{23453}{23520}I'm still having that|psycho dream. Hello.
{23549}{23634}- Oh. Oh.|- Oh, no, no! Don't worry! Ape friend.
{23638}{23686}- Ape make your breakfast.|- What does it want?|What does it want?
{23690}{23811}"It" wants its Physician's|Desk Reference, if you don't mind.
{23815}{23887}Unless you'd rather die|of dengue fever, of course.
{23891}{23966}That is very funny!
{23970}{24045}I thought I heard|the monkey talk.
{24049}{24123}But that is totally|understandable, right?
{24127}{24189}I mean, why wouldn't|an ape read textbooks?
{24193}{24252}And why wouldn't I find|myself in a tree house...
{24256}{24384}with room service and a Tarzan wannabe,|wearing a, um, um--
{24387}{24436}- What do you call that thing?|- Butt flap.
{24440}{24496}Right.
{24500}{24573}Ohh--
{24637}{24671}Ooh!
{24723}{24810}Bit of a shock, I suppose. Yes.
{24814}{24853}Fever.
{24857}{24985}Cold compress. Dab her lightly, George.|"Talking monkey."
{25017}{25074}That's the ticket. Good.
{25129}{25188}Huh? Somethin' funny|about this fella.
{25192}{25310}She's not a "fella," George. She's|a woman, the female of your species.
{25314}{25373}You mean Ape and George|not brothers?
{25403}{25453}Well, in a sense,|we are related.
{25457}{25516}After all, we're both members|of the primate family.
{25520}{25565}Primate family. Brothers.
{25569}{25645}I suppose one might claim|that there would--
{25649}{25743}Mommy, make that monkey|stop talking.
{25747}{25859}Perhaps I should refrain from speaking|around her, as it seems to upset her.
{26285}{26381}- What your name?|- Ursula.
{26385}{26458}Ursula Stanhope.
{26462}{26523}- Who are you?|- George.
{26527}{26588}George Primate.
{26592}{26677}And that brother Ape.|Ape Primate.
{26681}{26760}Ah! Oh, um--
{26764}{26856}Okay, I'm gonna|pass out again now.
{26860}{26909}Bye.
{26992}{27069}It's a sissy white ape.|I would've choked the life out of him...
{27073}{27147}except that he had two of his|lion buddies jump me from behind.
{27151}{27215}So in this version,|there are two lions with the white ape?
{27219}{27277}A minute ago,|there was only one.
{27281}{27392}H-Hey, the important thing,|Kwame, is that I was outnumbered.
{27455}{27503}Absolutely.
{27769}{27810}Ursula!
{28067}{28177}Hi. When I woke up this morning,|I remembered about that lion...
{28181}{28263}and I know you|saved me yesterday.
{28267}{28347}- And I just wanted to say thank you.|- Ah!
{28351}{28404}Ooh!
{28408}{28496}Now that I'm feeling better,|I realize the others must think|I'm cat food by now.
{28500}{28587}And I don't want my fian--|this guy that I was with-- to worry.
{28591}{28667}So, so I should probably go|and look for them...
{28671}{28714}and I was wondering|if you could help me.
{28718}{28790}Uh-- Ursula want to go already?
{28886}{28928}Okay, George help.|Get trusty doggy.
{28932}{28979}Oh, you have a dog.|That's great.
{28983}{29038}Doggy will help find friends.|George call Shep.
{29042}{29118}Shep! Here, boy!
{29122}{29179}Come on! Here, boy.
{29183}{29237}Shep!
{29282}{29381}Here comes Shep.|Come on, Shep! Come on, boy!
{29385}{29489}That a boy! Want to play?|Come on! Come on! Come on!
{29532}{29583}Good boy.
{29587}{29683}Come on, boy! Come on!|Good boy, Shep! Come on!
{29687}{29746}Whoa, whoa, whoa! Stop, stop,|stop, stop, stop, stop, stop!
{29750}{29800}Sit. Sit.
{29804}{29900}Good boy!|Good obedience training.
{29904}{29963}- George trained from pup.|- That's your dog?
{29967}{30050}This Shep, George's big,|grey, peanut-lovin' poochie.
{30054}{30127}Good boy, Shep! Good boy.
{30131}{30191}Good boy, Shep. Good boy.
{30195}{30317}- That's a good boy. Wanna shake?|- Huh?
{30321}{30413}- Good doggy. Be nice.|- Shep.
{30417}{30543}Shake? George. George.
{30547}{30593}George!
{30742}{30804}- See? Shep shake.|- Oh, George.
{30808}{30880}He's a big poochie, all right.
{30884}{30932}Does he fetch?
{31031}{31084}Here, boy. Come on, boy.|Want a stick?
{31088}{31168}Want a stick?|Where's the stick?
{31207}{31247}Where's the stick, Shep?
{31251}{31297}Here it is.|Here, boy. Fetch!
{31346}{31410}Come on, boy!|Run, run! Run, boy!
{31414}{31504}Atta boy! Good boy.|Go on, boy! Go get it!
{31655}{31716}Where'd he go?
{31795}{31854}- Wow!|- No, not in the roses!
{31941}{31982}Ungawa, Shep!
{31986}{32057}And so, with the help|of the jungle king's big, grey...
{32061}{32133}peanut-loving poochie,|George and Ursula set out...
{32137}{32229}on a desperate search to find|her fianc-- uh, that guy she was with--
{32233}{32298}Lyle! Lyle!
{32302}{32418}- Ursula! Ursula!|- while he desperately|searched for her.
{32422}{32519}But by the end of the afternoon|her desperation had dimmed...
{32523}{32573}That was fantastic!
{32577}{32635}and she had given up|all hope of everything...
{32639}{32751}except enjoying the jungle king's|company from her precarious perch|atop his faithful doggy.
{32755}{32831}- So, where are we going now?|- To find Tookie-Tookie bird|for jungle news.
{32835}{32909}Tookie-Tookie bird.|I love that.
{32913}{33002}Later they rested,|while the tired tusker teethed on a--
{33006}{33083}Wait a second.|The dog bone is too much. Lose it.
{33087}{33135}That's better.
{33191}{33270}Bongo-gram.|What could it mean?
{33311}{33344}Tookie-Tookie!
{33458}{33535}Tookie say|little monkey in trouble.
{33539}{33585}George investigate.
{33589}{33655}Tookie-Tookie!
{33949}{34031}What happened?
{34035}{34102}- Oh!|- Where other monkeys?
{34106}{34156}Where? There?
{34160}{34221}How many? That many?
{34225}{34313}Lots of monkey.|Then what happened?
{34362}{34408}Tell George more.
{34412}{34461}No!
{34490}{34566}Little monkey say other monkeys|call little monkey "runt."
{34570}{34692}- Not let little monkey play games.|- Poor thing. Hi, monkey.
{34776}{34826}H-Hi. You okay?
{34830}{34875}No.
{34924}{34991}Don't cry.
{35037}{35082}Huh.
{35086}{35162}Little monkey like Ursula.
{35326}{35401}- What did you tell him?|- Just watch.
{35849}{35909}Uh-oh!
{36984}{37073}Meanwhile, back at a really|big footprint in the mud--
{37143}{37204}Let me through.|What's happening?
{37208}{37279}This footprint does not|belong to any of my men.
{37283}{37370}See? There's your proof.|The white ape does exist.
{37374}{37470}Now all we have to do is track down|the girl and the ape's in the bag.
{37474}{37542}N-No, seriously. I don't know|if I want to do this again.
{37546}{37630}Ursula need to relax when it come|to vine swinging, for George.
{37689}{37757}Swing, swing, swing.|Come on.
{37761}{37818}Want George of Jungle to tell you|special vine-swinging secret?
{37822}{37895}Fine. Tell me all your secrets.
{37899}{37986}George's secrets. Hm!|There's the shortest book ever written.
{37990}{38105}- Oh.|- Wrap it around your sock for|special George of Jungle foot lock.
{38136}{38191}- Now, ready to try again?|- No.
{38537}{38660}- Like this, Ursula!|- He flies through the air|with the greatest of ease
{38664}{38744}Our daring young man|on the flying trapeze
{38748}{38853}- Look, no hands!|- His movements so graceful|All girls he could please
{38857}{38963}And with love|he is swinging away
{38967}{39056}- He flies through the air|with the greatest of ease|- That's pretty good.
{39060}{39137}- George, watch out for that...|- Our daring young man on the--
{39141}{39203}tree.
{39515}{39583}Ladies and gentlemen,|I give you the king of the jungle.
{39808}{39867}Where the devil is my egg timer?
{39898}{39933}- Tookie-Tookie.|- Tookie!
{39937}{40026}I'm fed up with this felonious fowl|stealing everything in the kitchen.
{40059}{40127}- Miserable creature.|- Tookie-Tookie.
{40131}{40205}George, what on earth|are you doing?
{40209}{40287}George just feel like looking|a little special today, that all.
{40333}{40399}Possibly there is a stirring|of special feelings within you?
{40477}{40541}Uh-huh.
{40735}{40810}George having stirring|of special feelings right now.
{40814}{40880}I see.
{40884}{40967}- Good thing she same species, huh?|- Yes.
{40971}{41040}Ape?
{41044}{41132}Tell George how to make|Ursula George's mate.
{41136}{41213}Please? Brother?
{41219}{41338}First, command her attention by bulging|out your cheeks and pursing your lips.
{41342}{41434}- Show George.|- All right. Just like this. Watch.
{41565}{41630}Even puffier.
{41634}{41725}Next, display your interest|by drawing back your upper lip...
{41729}{41804}jutting your jaw forward|and exposing your teeth.
{41808}{41914}- Like this? Like this? Right?|- Now, throw a handful|of leaves in the air...
{41918}{42007}then leap about and hoot|in a dominant fashion.
{42101}{42194}-Like this, Ape?|-Good. She won't be able to resist that.
{42301}{42347}Ursula!
{42351}{42412}Gosh, this trail's really rough.
{42537}{42592}"Ursula! Ursula!"
{42759}{42823}- Hey, come back here.|- They're not abandoning us, are they?
{42827}{42852}They are threatening.
{42858}{42883}If you don't mind, Kwame...
{42887}{42986}I have a knack for getting|the most out of my employees.
{42990}{43086}- Do you mind if I address the porters?|- They only speak Swahili.
{43090}{43186}Well, I just happen to have|a Swahili phrase book.
{43190}{43244}Be my guest.
{43756}{43815}I think our troubles are over.
{43819}{43928}Tell them I'll pay 50 zamoles|a man if they'll help me capture|the white ape and bring him back alive.
{43932}{44028}Alive? After he, uh--
{44032}{44104}Well, he pulled Ursula's scrunchie off,|we know that much.
{44108}{44193}- 50 zamoles a man. What do you say?|- They only speak Swahili.
{44197}{44262}One hundred zamoles a man|and you got a deal.
{44266}{44337}- Hey, wait a second.|- Done.
{44383}{44451}Meanwhile, at a very big|and expensive waterfall set...
{44455}{44530}Ursula was amazed that she was lost|in the wilderness with a jungle man.
{44534}{44623}Here I am, lost in the wilderness|with a jungle man.
{44743}{44850}I should be terrified that no one|will ever find me, but I'm not.
{44893}{44968}- Thank you.|- For what?
{44972}{45028}For this adventure.
{45032}{45089}It's what I've always wanted.
{45123}{45192}King of jungle|only here to help.
{45324}{45407}Mr Boombastic
{45411}{45475}The awesome, boombastic|romantic, fantastic lover
{45507}{45577}Sade
{45581}{45631}Mr Lover-Lover
{45635}{45705}- Mr Lover-Lover|- George, are you okay?
{45709}{45767}- Mr Lover-Lover|- Your face is swelling up like--
{45771}{45847}- Ah, Mr Lover-Lover|- Is something in my teeth?
{46083}{46117}Okay.
{46246}{46290}Listen, um...
{46294}{46402}I'm gonna step outside|for a little air, okay?
{46482}{46599}- Are you sure you threw the leaves?|- Yeah, George threw leaves.
{46603}{46672}Well, cheer up, old boy.|I spent all day...
{46676}{46731}poring through every book|in the library...
{46735}{46805}and finally I found this.
{46836}{46929}It's positively packed full|of human courtship rituals.
{46933}{47018}Listen.|"What's a nice girl like you...
{47022}{47095}doing in a plane like this?"
{47263}{47309}Go for it.
{47460}{47516}- Hi.|- Hi.
{47650}{47717}What-- Oh.
{47808}{47904}- Did you fight a crocodile for this?|- Oh. No, George not fight.
{47908}{47976}Crocodile have toothache.
{47980}{48095}George pull tooth.|Crocodile give to George after. Gift.
{48099}{48130}Good juju.
{48134}{48227}- Juju?|- Good luck. Protection.
{48290}{48401}I have something like that too.|Want to see?
{48439}{48485}It's not worth anything.
{48489}{48583}I found it in a cereal box|when I was ten years old.
{48587}{48669}It's my good luck. My juju.
{48750}{48827}- Can l--|- Oh.
{49124}{49178}I want you to have that.
{49182}{49255}For George?
{49285}{49362}That's the nicest present|George ever get.
{49390}{49431}Thank you.
{49676}{49749}- All right, man.|- Yeah.
{49753}{49838}It dancin' time.
{49888}{49971}- Ursula, wanna dance?|- Oh, no. Thanks.
{49975}{50047}- I'd be too embarrassed.|- What mean "embarrassed"?
{50051}{50149}That's when you feel stupid|in front of other people.
{50153}{50213}You know, like|they're judging you.
{50217}{50284}- You've never felt that?|- No.
{50288}{50347}There are no other people.
{50351}{50405}- Good point.|- George not feel stupid.
{50409}{50477}Sometimes George smash|into tree, and sometime--
{50629}{50699}Sometimes George fall out of tree house,|but not feel stupid.
{50703}{50747}Something good|always happen after.
{50751}{50831}George just lucky, I guess.
{50835}{50948}One day I looked up|and there you were
{50952}{51052}No people here to look stupid for.|Just George.
{51056}{51189}Like a simple question|looking for an answer
{51193}{51300}Now I am a whale|Listening to some inner call
{51304}{51396}Swimming blindly to throw|myself upon your shore
{51400}{51512}What if I don't find you|when I have landed
{51516}{51620}Would you leave me here to die|on your shore, stranded
{51624}{51698}Think I know why|the dog howls at the moon
{51731}{51824}I think I know why|the dog howls at the moon
{51828}{51938}I sing dela, dela
{52010}{52065}When I'm with you
{52233}{52297}I burn for you
{52301}{52360}I've been waiting for you|all my life
{52364}{52409}Hoping for a miracle
{52413}{52525}I've been waiting day and night|Day and night
{52529}{52633}I've been waiting for you all my life|Waiting for redemption
{52637}{52748}I've been waiting day and night|I burn for you
{53061}{53146}And so it came to pass|that George of the Jungle...
{53150}{53235}attended his first co-ed dance.
{53384}{53479}But his rapturous rendezvous with the|urban heiress was to be short-lived...
{53483}{53615}as the very next morning, Kwame and|his men were drawing dangerously close.
{53619}{53753}That is, dangerously close to shoving|a coconut up Lyle's sleeping bag.
{53757}{53801}That's it! I've had it!
{53805}{53903}I am the richest, smartest, handsomest|guy here, so I get to go first.
{54057}{54101}There's an elephant around here.
{54105}{54200}Bad guy falls in poop.|Classical element of physical comedy.
{54204}{54289}Now comes the part where we throw|our heads back and laugh. Ready?
{54293}{54349}Ready.
{54453}{54533}Those were nowhere near|properly digested.
{54537}{54608}In case anybody's|wondering, I'm okay.
{54648}{54701}Have you cleaned my lighter yet?
{54923}{54962}Come on, come on.
{55031}{55102}That was Ursula.|Did you hear that?
{55106}{55170}She's alive. Ursula--
{55174}{55255}Why don't you bring on a brass band|while you're at it, you nit?
{55259}{55330}We gotta be stealthy here, right?
{55334}{55392}Stealthy. Right.
{55479}{55586}Party time.|We'll take it from here.
{55882}{55928}Get off!
{56038}{56098}It's him!
{56102}{56207}Hey, it's a dude. I told you|there weren't no white ape.
{56211}{56290}You dragged me all the way|up here to look at some guy|in a leopard-skin bikini.
{56294}{56378}- If I wanted to see that,|I could've stayed in Miami.|- Wait a second.
{56382}{56488}The white ape is a man?|Let me at him.
{56492}{56574}Hang on. Could you, uh, see|if he's dangerous?
{56578}{56650}Here, boy!|Where's my little doggy?
{56654}{56693}I've got a feeling he's not.
{56697}{56745}Okay. I'll go first.
{56749}{56814}If he gets aggressive,|I'll scare him off with this.
{56818}{56910}- I thought that was a lighter.|- It is a lighter,|but he doesn't know that.
{57066}{57120}Ursula, it's me.
{57124}{57240}Lyle. Your man.|I've come for you. Are you okay?
{57329}{57378}Ursula!
{57382}{57448}- Lyle, what are you doing here?|- Thank God.
{57452}{57548}Mushy bear, you're safe.|I don't believe it!
{57552}{57656}Oh, I was so afraid|for your safety.
{57719}{57814}Lyle! Don't get all smoochy|and disgusting with me, okay?
{57818}{57872}I remember what you did|when that lion came.
{57876}{57987}What are you talking about?|I was fighting the lion the whole time.
{57991}{58066}You were just so terrified|you don't remember.
{58070}{58166}- I remember George,|that's who I remember.|- George?
{58170}{58222}Look over there.|What do you see?
{58283}{58335}- An elephant.|- But what has the elephant got?
{58433}{58508}- Fleas.|- Ivory! White gold.
{58512}{58612}Listen, Ursula, I have no idea what|you're talking about. Can we just go?
{58616}{58687}- George!|- Ursula!
{58691}{58736}Ready...
{58740}{58792}aim...
{58905}{58969}Run, Shep!|Run for your life!
{58973}{59021}Did that monkey just speak?
{59025}{59072}That monkey just spoke.
{59076}{59124}- I knew it.|- He talked.
{59128}{59174}- Shoot it now.|- Huh?
{59178}{59274}With the tranquillizer gun, idiot!|That ape's worth a fortune.
{59278}{59321}No!
{59325}{59387}Stop, or I'll shoot!
{59591}{59635}- No!|- No!
{59639}{59769}George!
{59773}{59870}Whew! Okay, kids, let's settle down|and review the important information.
{59874}{59925}Lyle is a big doofus.|Poor George was really shot...
{59929}{59991}but can't die because,|let's face it, he's the hero.
{59995}{60077}So, the naturally concerned|and preternaturally wealthy|Ursula Stanhope...
{60081}{60159}whisked George off on a private jet|bound for the country of his birth...
{60163}{60234}where he would get the finest|medical treatment available.
{60238}{60334}I'm gonna get you the finest|medical treatment available.
{60338}{60437}As for those pesky, pernicious|and putrid poachers, Max and Thor...
{60441}{60520}they awaited their fate|in the Bujumbura jail.
{60524}{60585}You two, out.
{60589}{60666}- Acquitted?|- No, deported.
{60670}{60742}Meanwhile, Kwame and his men faced|the next-to-impossible task...
{60746}{60864}of picking out George's assailant|from a line-up of the usual suspects.
{60868}{60928}Too short. Too sweaty.
{60932}{61015}Wait a second! That's the guy.|That's the guy who shot him.
{61019}{61086}- I never forget a face.|- Me?
{61246}{61344}No, Max. Forget about it. I do not want|to listen to any more of your ideas.
{61348}{61449}You'll like this one. We're gonna steal|Georgie-boy's talking ape.
{61453}{61514}- You mean, back up the mountain?|- Thor, that ape is our ticket...
{61518}{61580}out of poaching|and into show business.
{61584}{61656}- No.|- Think about it. We got a talking ape.
{61660}{61706}What do Siegfried and Roy have?
{61710}{61766}- Sequins?|- Exactly.
{61770}{61840}Get ready for room service,|mate, and girls.
{61844}{61899}We're gettin' our ape|and going to Vegas.
{61903}{61980}By next weekend,|we'll be headlining at the Tropicana.
{61984}{62040}- Nobody is gonna stop us.|- Right.
{62044}{62110}George of the Jungle|must be halfway to Frisco by now.
{62116}{62200}Ah, but the plotting poachers|were only half correct...
{62204}{62311}for at that very moment, our handsome|hero was all the way to San Francisco.
{62315}{62392}- Yes, Mother, I'm safe.|- You're sure you didn't|catch dengue fever?
{62396}{62444}No, Mother, I did not|catch dengue fever.
{62448}{62502}- Well, how's your temperature?|- Normal.
{62506}{62582}- Colour of your tongue?|- Pink.
{62586}{62634}- What about your hmm-hmm?|- Regular.
{62638}{62711}Now, Lyle.|How is my darling future son-in-law?
{62715}{62756}Lyle is--
{62829}{62899}He's happy to be home, Mom.|Could you hold on one second?
{62984}{63124}George, please don't call any animals|into the car, okay? Thanks.
{63128}{63188}Mom? You there?
{63192}{63268}Mom, hold on. I'm losing you again.|George. George. No.
{63272}{63332}Are you paying any attention?|This is important.
{63336}{63461}No. I know it's important. Geo-Geo--|George. George. Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot.
{63492}{63559}This faster than riding big,|great, peanut-loving poochie Shep.
{63563}{63620}Love you, Mom. Gotta go.|Bye. Watch out for that--
{63662}{63733}Ooh!
{63900}{63950}So, what do you|think of my jungle?
{63954}{64015}This very high tree house.
{64019}{64072}Good place to call friends from.|Sound carry.
{64076}{64135}Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
{64224}{64270}The neighbours.
{64310}{64357}- Give it a rest!|- We're ten storeys up, George.
{64361}{64438}I don't think the animals|can make it up here.
{64442}{64501}Oh, sure.|George know that.
{64530}{64576}George know that.
{64813}{64863}You must be tired. I'll, um...
{64867}{64948}make the couch up for you|to sleep in the living room.
{64952}{65050}Oh, no. George sleep here|in tree house.
{65054}{65100}Okay. Good night.
{65169}{65231}Sleep sweet, Ursula.
{65235}{65288}Sleep sweet, George.
{65379}{65410}Ooh.
{65456}{65506}Well, Ursula's fiance|is in prison...
{65510}{65563}and there's a jungle man|sleeping on her balcony.
{65567}{65623}- She could use a best friend right now.|- Hi.
{65627}{65672}- Hi.|- I got here as fast as I could.
{65676}{65736}- Where is he?|- He's under the waterf--|He's in the shower.
{65740}{65784}Not any more.
{65788}{65832}- George.|- Oh. Bad waterfall.
{65836}{65938}First water get hot, then George slip|on this strange, yellow rock. Oh!
{65987}{66083}- Hi. George of Jungle.|- Charmed, I'm sure.
{66087}{66191}George.|Um, take this big book.
{66195}{66278}Whoop! Cover the booty,|get into decent clothes.
{66282}{66319}- Sorry, Betsy.|- Bye.|- No problem.
{66323}{66407}- Okay.|- I see why they made him|king of the jungle.
{66411}{66460}Betsy, I am|in trouble here, okay?
{66464}{66542}How am I gonna tell my parents|that my fiance's in an African jail...
{66546}{66589}and that I brought home|a jungle man?
{66593}{66654}You are totally stuck|on George, huh?
{66658}{66724}No, I am not!
{66728}{66830}-Can I have him then?|-Okay, let's think. Think, think, think.
{66834}{66906}Think, think, think, think,|think, think, think, think.|What am I gonna do about tomorrow?
{66910}{66979}Tomorrow is your engagement party,|and unless they give day passes...
{66983}{67055}out of Bujumbura Jail,|Lyle is not likely to attend.
{67059}{67146}So tell 'em the truth and don't|worry about it and take George.
{67150}{67226}- He can back up your story. Right?|- Yeah. All right.
{67230}{67279}So I'll tell my dad|first thing in the morning.
{67283}{67378}Make it second thing. First thing, l|suggest you buy jungle man some clothes.
{67485}{67558}Nice butt flap.
{67683}{67754}Being of a conservative mind|regarding gender roles...
{67758}{67806}Ursula Stanhope|wasted no time...
{67810}{67894}in taking George of the Jungle|to a fine haberdasher.
{67960}{68086}- And this is Neiman Marcus.|- Whoo! They have big, shiny cave.
{68090}{68192}Hello. Would you like|to sample our new fragrance?
{68196}{68242}Thank you.
{68386}{68484}Later, in the men's department, after|discovering his long-lost brothers...
{68488}{68597}the jungle king was pleased to find|he looked pretty good in Armani.
{68601}{68663}Pretty darn good.
{68723}{68767}Watch out, man!
{68771}{68853}Why everyone run around crazy,|like antelope in mating season?
{68857}{68934}They're just trying to make a living.|It's-- different kind|of jungle here, George.
{68938}{69002}It's survival of the fittest.|Dog eat dog.
{69005}{69083}- "Dog eat dog"-- Dog eat dog here?|- No, that's not what I meant.
{69087}{69134}George never bring Shep here.|Uh-uh. Never.
{69138}{69224}Every story gets to have a really big|coincidence, and here's ours.
{69228}{69307}Who should see them walking down|the street but Ursula's meddling mother?
{69311}{69359}Uh, yes, uh, Lyle Van de Groot,|please.
{69363}{69436}- I'm sorry. He's not back from Africa.|- He's not?
{69440}{69487}No. I'm sorry.
{69491}{69548}Meanwhile, back on Ape Mountain...
{69552}{69652}George's friends were going positively|ga-ga from missing the jungle king.
{69656}{69696}No!
{69700}{69776}Oh, look at this.|It's ruined. Ruined!
{69780}{69819}Shep, come here at once.
{69823}{69891}Come on!
{69895}{70036}How many times do I have to tell you?|My violin bow is not a chew toy!
{70040}{70078}Bad dog!
{70082}{70160}And you! Out of my sight,|you feathered fool.
{70196}{70310}No! Not on the tree house!|I'll smack you--
{70383}{70432}Ursula, it's Mother.|Pick up the phone...
{70436}{70511}and tell me who that man was|I saw you strolling with today.
{70515}{70611}And where is Lyle?|We must discuss the engagement party.
{70615}{70735}I know you're there, Ursula.|Pick up the phone and tell me|why you have been avoiding me.
{70739}{70795}Pick up the phone!
{70860}{70936}Well, I think that|was an overreaction.
{70976}{71024}Just make sure you stay here|while I'm at work...
{71028}{71134}and you can watch TV|and eat and relax.
{71138}{71193}And I'll be back as soon as I can.|Just stay here.
{71197}{71320}"Stay here"? George is king|of the jungle. No four walls built|by modern man can contain him.
{71324}{71423}Not true. George have every intention|of doing exactly what Ursula say.
{71427}{71543}- Really? Is that so?|- For a while.
{71547}{71687}And at that very moment,|Betsy and Ursula were on their way to|break the news about Lyle to her father.
{71691}{71752}- Good luck, kiddo.|- Surprise!
{71859}{71943}Ursula, welcome home,|sweetheart...
{71947}{71996}and happy engagement day.
{72002}{72053}Chock Full O' Nuts
{72057}{72143}The heavenly coffee
{72147}{72243}- The coffee that brings you together.|- When you're in love
{72290}{72407}Now George understand. George get|coffee, then Ursula want George.
{72719}{72767}Java-java-java-java,|java-java-java-java,|java-java-java-java.
{72771}{72849}So the low has moved offshore.|High pressure's built a ridge in.
{72853}{72903}The weather|is absolutely gorgeous.
{72907}{72967}- If you're not outside, you oughta be!|- Who, me?
{72971}{73026}- I mean you.|- Oh.
{73030}{73071}Okay!
{73075}{73133}And so, jazzed on java...
{73137}{73224}George of the Jungle made his way|into the city by the bay.
{73285}{73331}Whoo!
{73335}{73395}Quickly taking to tourism,|the jungle king enjoyed...
{73399}{73451}the first drive-through|dining of his life...
{73455}{73534}and strolled the city streets until|he found something so scintillating...
{73538}{73586}- he had to say:|- Ooh!
{73840}{73892}But nothing excited|the jungle king more...
{73896}{73966}than the sight of the biggest|rope bridge he had ever seen.
{73970}{74056}Ooh. Yeah.
{74554}{74600}- Help!|- Ooh.
{74604}{74650}Somebody help!
{74960}{75055}- To swing or not to swing?|- Help!
{75133}{75181}Swing.
{75403}{75523}As the king of the jungle|quickly calculated the angle|and velocity of his next big swing...
{75527}{75595}Ursula felt like jumping|off a bridge herself.
{75599}{75698}I feel so guilty.|I don't know what I'm going to do.
{75702}{75802}First thing: I suggest you tell your|father what you came here to tell him.
{75806}{75858}- Hi, Daddy.|- Hi, honey. Take a look at this.
{75862}{75943}The most remarkable thing|is happening on the Bay Bridge.
{75947}{76015}...where strong winds|have carried him to the Bay Bridge.
{76019}{76067}Our own Valerie Devlin|is live on the scene. Valerie?
{76071}{76141}Thank you, Terilyn.|We do have a breaking story...
{76145}{76202}- at the Bay Bridge...|- Help!|- where a parasailor dangles...
{76206}{76300}- helplessly, 500 feet above the water.|- Please! Hurry up! Help!
{76399}{76455}There's no word on who|this lone daredevil is.
{76459}{76547}- That's George.|- He appears to have some kind|of rope in his hand.
{76551}{76602}- He might be preparing to swing on it.|- I gotta go.
{77044}{77103}Excuse me, sir.|I have to get on this boat.
{77379}{77464}Hey, fella. George of Jungle.|Need a vine?
{77468}{77551}Hey, thanks a lot, man.|G-Get me out of this stuff, huh?
{77707}{77768}- Thanks, man.|- Oh, don't mention it.
{77772}{77867}King of jungle only here to help!
{78014}{78087}- George!|- Ursula! Ow!
{78586}{78639}Watch out for that--
{78835}{78892}- George!|- Ursula!|- What are you doing? Are you okay?
{78896}{78992}- You just saved that man's life!|- George just lucky, I guess.
{79033}{79106}Ooh. This coffee stuff|really work good.
{79135}{79227}...one of the most daring rescues|ever recorded live on television.
{79231}{79338}This is Valerie Devlin reporting|to you from under the Bay Bridge.|Back to you, Terilyn.
{79342}{79426}You know, they say the city by the bay|is the most romantic in the world...
{79430}{79503}and it looks as though|there might be a little romance|unfolding under the Bay Bridge.
{79507}{79574}- We'll be back in a moment.|- Ohh.
{79578}{79640}Meanwhile, back in the jungle--
{79644}{79734}There's five stinkin' apes out there.|Which one are we takin' to Vegas?
{79738}{79820}- The one who's playing chess.|- Checkmate.
{79955}{79997}- Yes!|- Sweet dreams, banana breath.|- Grab him!
{80019}{80097}Tookie. Go find George.
{80130}{80176}Tookie-Tookie.
{80362}{80400}Thor.
{80528}{80605}Let's get him in the cage|while he's still under. Come on.
{80672}{80737}As the pesky poachers|grunted and groaned...
{80741}{80805}pushing and pulling|the ponderous primate along...
{80809}{80904}the trusty Tookie-Tookie bird|was already winging to the rescue...
{80908}{80968}making a bird-line|for San Francisco...
{80972}{81052}where George of the Jungle was trying|to give the heiress Ursula...
{81056}{81104}the courage to face her parents...
{81108}{81201}by helping her discover|the juju within.
{81205}{81286}- Make jungle call.|Then you'll feel brave.|- No. I can't.
{81290}{81352}- Come on. Big breath.|Here. Support voice.|- N-No. No, no, no.
{81356}{81405}- Ursula, please? Pl-- Please?|- No, no!
{81409}{81513}- I can't do it.|- Big. Brave. Queen of jungle.|Come on, Ursula.
{81823}{81871}- Wow.|- Not bad for beginner.
{81877}{81936}- Hi, Ursula.|- Emboldened with jungle juju...|- Hi.
{81940}{82053}Ursula Stanhope went inside|to break the news to her parents,|who took it extremely well.
{82057}{82152}Mother, Daddy,|I love you both very much.
{82156}{82205}I have something|very important to tell you...
{82209}{82264}and I hope you'll understand.
{82268}{82387}- I don't want to marry Lyle any more.|- We understand, dear.
{82461}{82505}Just kidding.
{82593}{82695}- The young Miss Stanhope|proceeded to spill the beans...|- So, anyway, I went to the jungle--
{82699}{82743}very quickly...
{82925}{82999}until she got to|the important part at the end.
{83003}{83141}Then Lyle shot him. So Lyle|is in jail and George is with me...
{83145}{83191}and I don't want to marry|Lyle any more.
{83195}{83278}I knew it. It's that swinging man|from the bridge.
{83282}{83326}I saw you smooching on TV.
{83330}{83403}- Mother, we weren't smooching--|- How could you do this to me?
{83407}{83475}Don't you realize the calibre of people|who are going to be here?
{83479}{83561}- Calm down, Beatrice, and let her say--|- I thought we would be|introducing them...
{83565}{83662}to Lyle Van de Groot, not some|wild man you found in the jungle.
{83666}{83728}Beatrice, this is supposed to be|her wedding, not yours.
{83732}{83800}- So?|- Beatrice, I know you're upset...
{83804}{83880}and so am l, but we can't force her|to marry someone against her will.
{83884}{83954}- Why not?|- Mom. Dad.
{83958}{84057}I'm ready to go out there|and apologize to everybody|and tell them what really happened.
{84061}{84101}Absolutely not!
{84105}{84199}As far as I'm concerned, you--|you caught one of those viruses.
{84203}{84262}Yes, one of those dreadful|jungle viruses...
{84266}{84317}that get nice girls all confused.
{84321}{84429}And if Lyle survives that|awful jail, you will simply|have to kiss and make up.
{84433}{84533}As for this evening, we will hold|our heads high and we will carry on.
{84537}{84640}Now, darling, where is that charming|young friend of yours?
{84644}{84708}- Well, where is he?|- I don't know.|He's around here someplace.
{84712}{84786}- Well, find him. We haven't got|all day. Oh, Ursula, look!|- Oh, great!
{84790}{84918}How wonderful!|And look at Richard's exquisite|figurines of you and darling Lyle.
{84977}{85025}George, watch out for that--
{85233}{85298}Mom. Dad. This is George.
{85302}{85350}Hello, Mr and Mrs Ursula.
{85354}{85394}How do you do?
{85758}{85834}It is always such a pleasure|to see you, Mr Mayor.
{85838}{85898}And, you know, it's so nice|to get away from City Hall...
{85902}{85951}and be around some normal people|for a change.
{85955}{86083}Well, we are perfectly normal,|I assure you-- in an exceptional way,|of course.
{86087}{86166}Of course.|A-And what about this guy, Lyle?
{86170}{86250}You know, I'd really like to meet|the man you deem good enough|to marry your daughter.
{86254}{86333}Oh, well, unfortunately Lyle|is busy at the moment...
{86337}{86386}uh, tending to some legal affairs.
{86390}{86526}- Some pate, Mr Mayor?|- You know, I never touch that stuff.|- Oh.
{86530}{86598}- I had a lovely time.|- Would you excuse us, please?|- Excuse me, Dr Goldblum.
{86602}{86690}It's 7:30. Do you know where|your jungle man is?
{86766}{86830}So this is what you were doing|in the jungle. Clever girl.
{86834}{86942}Yeah. Um, he swung me on vines|and fed me coconut milk.
{86946}{87018}- I knew it.|- He's not a real meat loaf, is he?
{87022}{87086}No. I mean,|he's not brainy...
{87089}{87161}in that doctor, lawyer,|banker way...
{87165}{87223}but he has something else.
{87227}{87316}- He has a--|- Sensual intelligence.
{87320}{87366}"Sensual intelligence."
{87370}{87465}- Wow.|- Oh, my God.
{87469}{87515}What is it with chicks|and horses, huh?
{87998}{88070}George, how are you this evening?
{88122}{88189}Pretty sharp threads there,|uh-- George, right?
{88193}{88248}- Yeah. Where're you based?|- The jungle.
{88252}{88302}I hear ya.|We cut our teeth in New York also.
{88306}{88382}Eh, you considering a position|with Stanhope? That could be fruitful.
{88386}{88454}Fruitful? This place not so fruitful.|Nobody here have big coconuts.
{88621}{88651}George.
{88655}{88694}I wa-- Oh.
{88698}{88768}Would you mind|stepping outside with me--
{88772}{88825}Thank you so much--|for just a moment?
{88829}{88885}Sure.
{88945}{89012}- Hello, Beatrice.|- Hello, Ella.
{89016}{89065}Well, we haven't been friends|for very long, George...
{89069}{89128}but I already think I know|something about you.
{89132}{89258}- Oh?|- You are in love with my daughter.
{89262}{89371}- Oh, Mrs Ursula not so dumb.|- George.
{89375}{89498}My concern, however, is that Ursula|seems to reciprocate your feelings...
{89502}{89563}and that does present|a problem to me.
{89600}{89678}You see,|you and Ursula together...
{89682}{89765}would be unbefitting|her social stature.
{89769}{89864}You see? Let me put it in a way|you might understand.
{89868}{89926}Where you come from...
{89930}{90016}zebras marry zebras|and leopards marry leopards.
{90020}{90086}Stripes with stripes,|spots with spots.
{90090}{90197}Well, Ursula is a stripe|and you are a spot...
{90201}{90299}one which I intend to have removed|as soon as possible.
{90334}{90391}So you no want Ursula|to love George.
{90395}{90479}I would rather have my tongue nailed to|this table every morning at breakfast.
{90483}{90544}- That hurt.|- Not as much as you will|if you do anything...
{90548}{90613}to screw up my daughter's marriage|to Lyle Van de Groot.
{90617}{90713}When Lyle returns, this wedding|will proceed as planned.
{90717}{90803}If you do anything to upset that...
{90807}{90896}I will remove your reason|for wearing a loin cloth.
{90928}{90971}Steak tartare, Mrs Stanhope?
{90975}{91080}Oh, no, no. Thank you.|I've had quite enough protein for today.
{91084}{91149}Have a pleasant evening,|Mr Jungle.
{91754}{91802}Tookie? Tookie!
{91806}{91918}Tookie.|George so happy to see Tookie.
{92032}{92120}Ape kidnapped?|Ape ape-napped?
{92124}{92180}George save Ape!
{92223}{92279}Ursula.
{93611}{93709}Well, of course he went back to the|jungle. Where else would go-- the Hague?
{93713}{93762}But why would he leave|without saying goodbye?
{93766}{93859}Well, personally I think he acted|rather sensibly. Showed good character.
{93863}{93942}He understands that he belongs there,|you belong here.
{93946}{94027}It's really all a question|of stripes and spots.
{94031}{94104}What? Oh, no.
{94108}{94169}You got to him.|Mother, what did you say?
{94173}{94243}I simply said that if he|really cared for you...
{94247}{94349}he'd leave you alone and let you|get on with your life and marry Lyle.
{94353}{94417}- I am not marrying Lyle, Mother.|- Beatrice, perhaps we should just--
{94421}{94492}Arthur! Now, Ursula darling,|don't be ridiculous.
{94496}{94584}There's a big difference|between marriageable material|and a fling in the jungle.
{94588}{94657}"A fling in the jungle"?|"A fling in the jungle."
{94661}{94708}Who says I had|a fling in the jungle?
{94712}{94778}You don't think you can|fool your mother, do you?
{94782}{94864}You've been head over heels for that ape|ever since you brought him here.
{94868}{94990}Now, Ursula, that kind of love|is fleeting. You'll get over it.
{95153}{95239}- Did you just say "love"?|- No.
{95243}{95288}- You did.|- Ursula.|- You're right.
{95292}{95356}- Don't say it.|- I love him. I'm outta here.
{95360}{95452}Ursula, you can't love him.|Arthur, say something.
{95456}{95506}- Be careful out there, honey.|- What?
{95510}{95565}- Goodbye, Daddy.|- I love you.
{95569}{95628}- Wha--|- I love you, Mom. Thank you.
{95632}{95704}- Ursula-- Arthur, do something!|- What would you have me do?
{95708}{95786}- There's obviously no stopping her.|- Oh, God.
{95877}{95989}- Ursula!|- God, that woman's a pain in the ass.
{96043}{96102}Meanwhile,|halfway across the world...
{96106}{96157}another ass was feeling pain...
{96161}{96225}as an ape named Ape|was caged in a cage...
{96229}{96293}hoping to hear|the jungle king's awesome--
{96429}{96479}Hey, I'm pretty good at that--
{96483}{96530}and wondering|if he would ever come.
{96534}{96587}But the motion-sick mammal|needn't have moaned...
{96591}{96659}for that defender of the innocent,|protector of the weak...
{96663}{96744}and all-around good guy|George of the Jungle...
{96748}{96807}was closer than he knew.
{96927}{96992}Next time George get bigger box.
{98464}{98515}Oh! Bad luck.
{98600}{98639}- Did you hear something?|- What?
{98643}{98702}- I heard a noise.|- Shut up and push!
{98782}{98835}Oh, I think I chipped a tooth.
{98933}{99016}- Oh, Thor, you're disgusting.|- God, that wasn't me.
{99020}{99086}Not me.
{99653}{99719}- I'm hungry.|- Oh, shut up.
{99723}{99784}You've been yakkin' for 2 days straight,|and I'm gettin' mad enough to--
{99788}{99842}You know, you really should|work on your anger.
{99846}{99936}Have you tried Brankowski's|"Cage the Rage" technique?
{99940}{99999}Don't let him get to you, Thor.|He's just an ape.
{100003}{100067}That's a fine way to talk|to your meal ticket.
{100070}{100134}You keep that up, it's liable|to affect my stage performance.
{100138}{100200}Give him a banana, Thor.|It won't be long now.
{100204}{100253}That's what you said yesterday.
{100257}{100305}This trail's taking us|to the middle of nowhere.
{100309}{100391}The sign at the trail head said|"Short cut to Ape River."
{100395}{100478}Now, why would it say "short cut"|if it wasn't a--
{100482}{100594}Wait a minute.|Maybe it's a fake, a decoy trail.
{100598}{100676}Very good, Max.|Actually, the trail is a fake.
{100680}{100801}It circles Ape Mountain six times before|heading right back to the tree house.
{100805}{100903}- Ohh! Oh, I knew we was lost.|- Don't listen to him, Thor.
{100907}{100986}He's just tryin' to trick us,|lead us off the short cut...
{100990}{101032}so we take twice as long|on the regular trail.
{101036}{101089}We're already taking twice as long!
{101093}{101163}Are you gonna let a monkey|make a monkey out of ya?
{101167}{101233}- What?|- Duh!
{101237}{101354}Let's go. If he tells us the short cut|leads to the tree house...
{101358}{101429}then that's exactly|where it doesn't lead.
{101656}{101712}Ape?
{102252}{102319}- Poor ape-napped brother.|- Careful.
{102350}{102426}Max, look.|We're back at the tree house.
{102459}{102542}Well, I tried, but you fellas|are just too smart for me.
{102546}{102644}- Oh, no!|- "Oh, no" was right,|for the exhausted ape-nappers had--
{102648}{102745}Hey! Why don't you say something|constructive for a change,|like what we should do now.
{102749}{102839}-Because I don't like you.|-Well, I hate you, you snotty son of a--
{102843}{102951}I'll pretend I didn't hear that.|Having some fun now, hmm?
{102955}{103020}- Thor, were you fighting|with the narrator?|- Well, he started it.
{103024}{103060}- Did not.|- You did too!
{103064}{103105}- Did not.|- You did too!|- Did not!
{103109}{103148}- You did too!|- Thor, stop it!|- Ohh.
{103152}{103214}That's it. I'm not draggin'|this thing another inch.
{103218}{103298}- What are you doing? Get back there|and work. Where are you going?|- You wretched little weasel.
{103302}{103370}Aren't you the little weasel,|you big brontosaurus?
{103496}{103563}- Let's take care of him.|- Huh? Huh?
{103567}{103659}Whoa!|Why didn't you come sooner?
{103663}{103724}Why Ape have little stars|around head?
{103801}{103892}George, remember|everything I taught you about|Queensberry rules and fighting fair?
{103896}{103955}- Uh-huh.|- Well, now's a good time to forget it.
{103959}{104010}Let's finish him off.
{104112}{104217}- Oh, I can't breathe, Max.|- Let it out, Thor. Let it out.
{104374}{104444}Right, jungle boy.
{104820}{104871}- Huh?|- Huh?
{105645}{105687}Tookie-Tookie!
{105691}{105757}- Take this!|- Stop it! Ape!
{106158}{106247}Get it off!|Get it off of me, Max!
{106647}{106718}All right!
{106722}{106783}Shep, look out!
{106839}{106891}Ursula?
{107020}{107090}George good teacher.
{107161}{107282}George. George.|I came all this way to tell you that--
{107286}{107359}Ursula talk later.|George busy now.
{107411}{107460}- What?|- Fella got toucan on can.
{107464}{107520}I know.
{108069}{108151}Good show, George.|And you too, Tookie.
{108155}{108231}Oh, my hero.

{113276}{113354}Where's George?
{113464}{113532}You see? I told you|I'd have a boat waiting.
{114174}{114257}Okay, then. All righty.
{114261}{114331}Reverend Lyle|ready to perform the ceremony.
{114335}{114430}Do you, Ursula Stanhope,|take me, Lyle Van de Groot...
{114434}{114509}- to be your lawful wedded husband?|- Get a grip, Lyle.

{115217}{115277}Lyle!
{115378}{115426}Tookie-Tookie!

{117675}{117762}No!
{117882}{117956}No! No!
{117994}{118135}George, what I came here to say|was that I love you.
{118166}{118275}- Ursula love George?|- So much.
{118281}{118359}George love Ursula too.
{118363}{118474}And so George of the Jungle received|the first kiss of his life...
{118478}{118538}that came from|neither elephant nor ape.
{118587}{118633}And on the following new moon...
{118637}{118730}Ursula Stanhope finally got|the simple wedding she had hoped for...
{118734}{118799}as the San Francisco heiress|and the king of the jungle...
{118803}{118897}joined their hearts forever|in wedded bliss.
{118984}{119032}- The rings!|- The rings.

{119661}{119725}Arthur, I wish you'd do something|about all these monkeys.
{119728}{119786}I feel like Jane Goodall.
{119790}{119915}Madam, I knew Jane Goodall,|and you are no Jane Goodall.
{120241}{120299}Listenin' to some inner call
{120303}{120401}Swimmin' blindly|to throw myself upon your shore
{120405}{120462}I think I know why|the dog howls at the moon
{120519}{120606}I think I know why|the dog howls at the moon
{120610}{120729}And I sing, dela, dela
{120802}{120855}When I'm with you
{121011}{121087}I burn for you
{121091}{121147}I been waiting for you|all my life
{121151}{121193}Hoping for a miracle

{121780}{121858}protector of the weak|and all-around good guy...
{121862}{121926}George of the Jungle.
{121929}{121993}A noble king,|his beautiful queen...
{121997}{122059}and their nimble young heir|to the jungle throne.
{122063}{122127}George, watch out for that--
{122130}{122222}I know what you're thinking--|How does a baby raised by an ape...
{122226}{122309}grow up to be king of the jungle,|find his queen...
