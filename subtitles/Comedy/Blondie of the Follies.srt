1
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:03,840
But I have that date.

2
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:05,420
I'm not going to let you go.

3
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:07,680
- Why not?
- They might be a couple of kidnappers.

4
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,490
They are not.
They're in the burlesque business.

5
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:12,270
We might get in the show.
- Us in a show? Don't be silly.

6
00:01:14,554 --> 00:01:17,599
- Mind your own affairs.
- I'll see you sometime.

7
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:20,700
- How do you do, Mr. Kinskey.
- Why, hello. How are ya?

8
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:23,420
I want you to meet my friend, Blondie.
Blondie McClune.

9
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:25,830
She's the gal I was telling you about.
My best friend, you know.

10
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:27,860
- Where is she?
- Blondie, come here.

11
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,900
Hey, Blondie, come on, honey.

12
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:32,400
Meet Mr. Kinskey.

13
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:34,430
Hello, sweetheart - Come on, get in.

14
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:36,450
Say, how do we get in here?

15
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,880
- Don't do that.
- Blondie!

16
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,330
Say, what's going on?

17
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,720
That's a cute chicken, that.
Does she live here too?

18
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:52,770
Oh yes. We've been pals
since we were kids.

19
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,290
She's kind of scared though.
Some people are that way.

20
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:57,110
Scared? She gave me a sock in the snoot.

21
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:59,180
Mr. Kinskey, I'm going to talk to her
about that.

22
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:01,450
All right, honey, see you later.
Don't you stand me up now.

23
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:04,640
No, I won't. I promised you, didn't I?

24
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,810
I'll be down when I get my things.

25
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,040
All right, kid. Bye bye.

26
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:08,830
- Maybe you better wait over there for me
- Sure.

27
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:09,840
Don't be long.

28
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:12,110
- Bye. - Isn't she marvelous?

29
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:14,440
Say, I want to see you.

30
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:16,690
Oh yeah?

31
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:19,190
You little hick.

32
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:22,420
When I introduce you to a gentleman
of my acquaintance,

33
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:24,790
I'll ask you to try and
behave like a lady.

34
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,960
Tell me more, Lady Agatha.

35
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,050
Oh, you're common.

36
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:31,180
I may be common but I don't pick up
with that kind of trash.

37
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:32,490
Trash?

38
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:35,930
Those two gentlemen are in a position
to open up the way for a career.

39
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,430
Something I've had in mind
for a long time.

40
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,160
You're funny when you're putting it on.

41
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:43,830
You mean you're going on the stage?

42
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:45,890
- I suppose that's funny.
- It's funny to me.

43
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,500
What are you going to do, sing?

44
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,200
That shows what you know.

45
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,000
You don't have to sing in burlesque.

46
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:54,130
Mr. Kinskey says
you just gotta be a looker.

47
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,940
And nobody can say I'm not that.

48
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:59,350
You're screwy and you don't know it.

49
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:00,730
Screwy? Listen here,

50
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:03,360
That's the last time you'll insult me.
Do you hear that?

51
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:08,040
You little trash.
- I'll kill you.

52
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:09,170
You cut it out.

53
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,200
Listen, you're getting too fresh.

54
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:23,160
Hey.

55
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:30,230
Lay off my family.

56
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,280
Get your whole family.
Your whole dirty family.

57
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,670
What's all the row?

58
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,700
It's Lottie hitting it up again.

59
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:37,550
That sounded like a fight.

60
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:40,250
I'm going to hit that dame
a good one someday.

61
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:42,460
Who does she think she is,
strutting around?

62
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,140
And get that kid away from here.

63
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:52,330
Say, what's the matter?

64
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:55,340
You treat me like a dog.
I'm only your husband, that's all.

65
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,380
Say, Blondie, was that Lottie talking to
those two swell guys down there in that new car?

66
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,560
Shut up and mind your baby, will you?

67
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:06,320
I better not mind him because
he's liable to catch my cold.

68
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:09,370
I gave you my cold remember?

69
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,400
That's about the only thing
you ever did give her.

70
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,990
Was that Lottie talking
with those fellows?

71
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,990
I don't know. I mind my own business.

72
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:18,790
What are you doing? Mending your dress?

73
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:22,110
Yes. I guess it's too old to mend.

74
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:26,710
Why can't you be quiet all day
like your father?

75
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,580
Ma? Ma?

76
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,600
- What is it?
- I gotta buy a new dress.

77
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,980
- What for?
- To go to work in, what else for?

78
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:34,313
- Where's my money?
- Why, Blondie I...

79
00:04:34,338 --> 00:04:36,740
What's the matter, Ma?
Did you spend it? All of it?

80
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,670
- What for?
- I can't tell you.

81
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:41,010
- Why can't you tell me?
- I promised not to.

82
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,830
- Who did you promise?
- I can't tell you.

83
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,910
Oh gee, what's the use?

84
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:46,410
That's the last time I'm going to leave
any of my money around here.

85
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:47,750
I'll put it in the bank.

86
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:49,190
Here hold it.

87
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:50,700
What are you blowing up about?

88
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,080
I saved up money to buy that dress.

89
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,380
Where do you all get off spending
my money that way?

90
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:57,470
Don't look at me. I didn't spend it.

91
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:01,110
Quit your crying in the stew, Ma.
It's thin enough already.

92
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:04,050
Stew? I could do with some nice
southern fried chicken.

93
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:05,820
I tell you, I'm getting fed up with all of it.

94
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:07,080
Fed up with what?

95
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:09,420
I've only got one dress.
If anything happened to it,

96
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:11,380
what am I supposed to do? Go out and beg?

97
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,870
Steal something I suppose.

98
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:16,120
Get Lottie to introduce you to one of those
swell ginks she was talking to.

99
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:18,300
She's the wise one.
One of them gave her something.

100
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:19,930
- How do you know?
- I saw them.

101
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:20,920
Oh, what a place.

102
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:22,950
If you don't like it, Blondie,
you know what you can do.

103
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,540
Every time you come home it's, "What
a place, what a place, what a place."

104
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:28,800
Shut up, Ma, save your tears.

105
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,650
These ladies that work downtown...

106
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:32,030
These ladies that work is right.

107
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:34,090
Sock the rich.

108
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:37,850
If they bring in that new income tax,
oh boy, that'll scorch them.

109
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:50,630
- Hello, Mrs. Callahan.
- Hello, Blondie.

110
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,850
- Lottie and me had a scrap.
- I know.

111
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:53,890
I socked her in the jaw.

112
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,900
Why, you silly girls, you!

113
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:01,950
Blondie, you're with Lottie
all the time.

114
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:03,110
What's wrong with her?

115
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:03,970
How do you mean?

116
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:07,470
You two girls are such good friends,
I thought you ought to know.

117
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,670
She's not herself at all.

118
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,950
Have you any idea of anything
that's worrying her?

119
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:15,380
Lottie's all right. She's up one minute
and down the next.

120
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:17,660
I know her.
- I know you do.

121
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,190
That's why I'm asking you.

122
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:21,930
Yes, I'm coming, I'm coming.

123
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,120
Hi, Pop.

124
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:44,620
- Hello, darling.
- You've been walking.

125
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,440
Well...

126
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,790
The doctor said you shouldn't.

127
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:51,160
Oh, the doctors.

128
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:53,550
He said you shouldn't.
Where did you walk from?

129
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:55,870
- The corner.
- What corner?

130
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,960
Quite a lot of corners today, Blondie.

131
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:01,650
What do you mean a lot of corners?

132
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:04,450
- Well...
- They...

133
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:06,870
They didn't let you out
at the office, did they?

134
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:11,850
When? Today?

135
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:13,920
Day before yesterday.

136
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:16,420
I've been looking for something
ever since.

137
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:19,300
I told your mother not to tell you.

138
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:21,390
I thought we were pals.

139
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:24,540
I thought that I'd land something
before this.

140
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,310
Things are awful bad, terrible bad.

141
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:30,290
There are several things to be
attended to. The rent and...

142
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,970
I think Ma paid the rent.

143
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:34,470
- How?
- Never mind.

144
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:37,000
She didn't go and use your...

145
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:40,160
You know, your dress money.
- I don't need another dress.

146
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,200
- Oh Blondie.
- Lottie and me had a scrap.

147
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:46,290
I socked her. Look what she did to me.

148
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:48,270
Poor baby.

149
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:51,810
I've got several good leads out now.

150
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:54,510
And there are several things wrong with
you that the doctors told you about.

151
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:57,250
Oh, the doctors. I'm all right.

152
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:59,870
- I'm not so sure about that.
- What do you know about it?

153
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,040
I know about you.

154
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,810
Good evening, Lottie.

155
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:08,490
Good evening, Mr. McClune.

156
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,380
Where is she going?

157
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,840
I don't know. I think she's nutty.

158
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:20,750
Hey.

159
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:22,030
What's the idea?

160
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:24,270
I'm going away.

161
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:28,140
I thought I'd like to tell you goodbye.

162
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,370
Where are you going?

163
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:33,770
I told you. A career.

164
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,180
I've been trying to get out of
this difficult place for months.

165
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:37,010
Well, it's wrong.

166
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,310
I know it's wrong.

167
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:39,890
What do you mean?

168
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:42,190
Something inside me tells me it's wrong.

169
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:44,270
If appearing on the stage is wrong,

170
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:46,560
and having a few decent things
of my own is wrong,

171
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:47,810
then give me plenty of it.

172
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:51,510
Good luck then.
I guess you'll be all right.

173
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:55,160
If you ever need a pal,
you'll let me know, won't you?

174
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:56,750
Sure I will, kid.

175
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:59,570
I like you, Blondie.

176
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,070
I've always liked you.

177
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:09,945
Well goodbye, Mug. Take care
of yourself, won't you?

178
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:12,540
You'll write me often, won't you?
- Sure.

179
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,409
- Mind you do now.
- I'll be all right.

180
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:16,840
I know you will.

181
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,720
I know you will.

182
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:22,666
So long, Mug.
- So long, kid.

183
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:55,074
All right. I'll tell you the truth then.

184
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:57,690
I'm going to visit my dear mama.

185
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,330
I saw silly little boys
selling silly little badges

186
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:03,780
and I suddenly realized
it was Mother's Day.

187
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:05,720
And I was overcome with remorse.

188
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:09,620
Oh, you're naughty!

189
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,290
You're a naughty boy.

190
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:13,800
How is the market?

191
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:18,170
Oh, that horrid word!

192
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:20,840
I have a delightful cake

193
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,420
with "Mother" done in pearls
and sugar over the top.

194
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,820
And instead of taking large blossoms,

195
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:30,150
I thought it would be rather sweet to take
just a little bunch of gardenias.

196
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:32,560
And Madelon has them here now.

197
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:37,190
She's tied them onto the cake with
a huge bow of snow white ribbon.

198
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:39,400
Mother will cry.

199
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,940
I know she'll cry.

200
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:42,780
And perhaps I will too.

201
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:45,530
And...Hello?

202
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,880
Hello?

203
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:54,070
Can you beat that?

204
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:56,450
He hung up, the dirty son of...

205
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,974
Well, Madelon, how can I carry that?
- Just put your arm there Madame.

206
00:11:02,224 --> 00:11:04,476
Oh, my dear. Cunning!

207
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:05,700
Your bag.

208
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,880
Oh, Madelon, we'll have some cocktails,

209
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:11,270
caviar and a little cold wine.

210
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:12,564
Tres bien, Madame.

211
00:11:12,569 --> 00:11:13,880
And oh yes,

212
00:11:14,162 --> 00:11:17,486
if anyone calls me, just say
that I'm visiting my mother...

213
00:11:18,009 --> 00:11:19,271
on Long Island.

214
00:11:19,771 --> 00:11:21,073
Oui, Madame.

215
00:11:21,716 --> 00:11:23,550
What's the matter with Alexander?
If you want a pitcher.

216
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,250
- Come in.
- A good man.

217
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:26,329
Yes, well I saw him play a game once...

218
00:11:26,342 --> 00:11:28,342
- Anybody home?
- Come in, Mrs. Callahan.

219
00:11:28,842 --> 00:11:29,991
Lottie's here.

220
00:11:29,996 --> 00:11:31,406
Lottie's here? Where?

221
00:11:31,411 --> 00:11:32,938
For crying out loud.

222
00:11:33,085 --> 00:11:35,085
Oh, I won't disturb you if you're dining...

223
00:11:35,115 --> 00:11:37,115
Oh, hello, Lottie. Come in, have a chair.

224
00:11:37,859 --> 00:11:38,954
Please don't get up.

225
00:11:38,967 --> 00:11:40,113
Have you had your dinner, Lottie?

226
00:11:40,151 --> 00:11:43,212
Thanks awfully, but I never dine
until after the show.

227
00:11:45,232 --> 00:11:48,422
My goodness, you look as though
your racket was booming.

228
00:11:48,469 --> 00:11:50,721
Oh Pete, the same old Pete, aren't you?

229
00:11:50,734 --> 00:11:52,105
- Sure.
- Lottie!

230
00:11:52,303 --> 00:11:54,303
Oh Lottie, I'm glad to see you!

231
00:11:54,316 --> 00:11:56,316
You look swell.

232
00:11:56,337 --> 00:11:57,617
And what about you?

233
00:11:57,664 --> 00:11:59,183
- What about you, Mug?
- Mug?

234
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:02,815
It seems like years ago.
- It does.

235
00:12:03,315 --> 00:12:05,315
You seen the new addition?
His name is Horace.

236
00:12:05,807 --> 00:12:08,506
Are those real silver fox?

237
00:12:08,553 --> 00:12:10,090
Yes, they are, aren't they?

238
00:12:12,217 --> 00:12:15,847
- Lace, real old lace.
- That's lace and how.

239
00:12:15,852 --> 00:12:17,886
Would you mind the baby please?

240
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,539
Well well well the same little place.
Oh my.

241
00:12:25,695 --> 00:12:27,695
Lottie, did you get them shoes
made for you?

242
00:12:27,901 --> 00:12:29,901
Oh my shoes? Do you like them?

243
00:12:29,931 --> 00:12:32,957
I found the sweetest little shop
just off Madison.

244
00:12:32,978 --> 00:12:36,857
You might have to make a lot of money
in the Follies. You just have to.

245
00:12:36,952 --> 00:12:40,114
- Why shouldn't the lady have a sideline?
- And why not?

246
00:12:40,227 --> 00:12:42,379
Mother darling, it's been charming

247
00:12:42,392 --> 00:12:43,172
but I must go now.

248
00:12:43,203 --> 00:12:45,459
I thought you'd be glad
to see Lottie again.

249
00:12:45,475 --> 00:12:47,297
We're very glad
to see you again, Lottie.

250
00:12:47,537 --> 00:12:51,458
Lottie? Oh Mother! That sounds
so strange to hear Lottie.

251
00:12:52,293 --> 00:12:54,900
Her name's Lurlene now. Lurlene Cavanaugh.

252
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:56,959
Lurlene Cavanaugh.
Oh, you've changed your name.

253
00:12:56,989 --> 00:12:58,803
You're married?
- No.

254
00:12:58,925 --> 00:13:00,079
Maybe you'd rather go now.

255
00:13:00,285 --> 00:13:02,521
Yes, well, goodbye! Goodbye!

256
00:13:03,859 --> 00:13:07,439
Lottie is sending me some sherry a friend gave
her and I'm bringing some down.

257
00:13:07,452 --> 00:13:09,030
Yes Mother, they'll adore it.
The madeira.

258
00:13:09,629 --> 00:13:11,524
Thanks, we've no use for it.

259
00:13:12,074 --> 00:13:16,588
What do you want to crab the sherry for?
I like a drop of sherry once in a while.

260
00:13:16,618 --> 00:13:20,110
My, you can still smell that perfume
she had on.

261
00:13:20,115 --> 00:13:23,163
I got a load of that. Kind of makes
you goose flesh all over.

262
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:29,788
- That's my flower, Pa.
- You've no use for it, Mother.

263
00:13:30,835 --> 00:13:34,930
Bob Musial. One of the best
baseball players in the world.

264
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:37,511
- Oh, go on.
- I saw a game in which Musial...

265
00:14:00,552 --> 00:14:02,110
Hey, get away from there, Jimmy Blake!

266
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:03,061
Slug!

267
00:14:03,344 --> 00:14:05,780
Where's that music coming from?
Is that the rad-i-o?

268
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:07,324
Radio, Blondie.

269
00:14:08,076 --> 00:14:11,323
That's the last time
I swing my hips into this dump.

270
00:14:11,361 --> 00:14:16,919
And I was trying to do the nice thing.
Jamais plus, jamais plus.

271
00:14:17,669 --> 00:14:22,633
Vite, Andre, a la maison.
- Say is that real french? Or are you kidding?

272
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:24,885
- Cigarette?
- No thanks.

273
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:28,430
Oh, that's pretty. "L.C."
- Lurlene Cavanaugh.

274
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:32,643
- Lucky Chump. - Not really so lucky.
- You're doing great, Kiddie.

275
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:34,538
Well, Blondie, what about you?

276
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:36,962
Don't make me laugh.
You said that upstairs.

277
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:38,429
Well, what about me?

278
00:14:38,568 --> 00:14:41,902
Are you, uh...snagging anyone?

279
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:43,735
I can't get a kick out of any
of the hicks I bump into,

280
00:14:43,749 --> 00:14:45,845
after seeing how a real gentleman acts.

281
00:14:45,884 --> 00:14:48,429
How do you know
how a real gentleman acts?

282
00:14:48,509 --> 00:14:51,318
In the movies.
I go to them all the time.

283
00:14:51,877 --> 00:14:52,743
Say, Lottie?

284
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:54,998
What's it like?
- What?

285
00:14:54,998 --> 00:14:55,249
Being made up to by a real swell
refined guy. What's it like? - What?

286
00:14:59,286 --> 00:15:03,507
It's so nice to see you again,
Blondie. I've always liked you.

287
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:07,261
- We've always been pals, haven't we?
- Of course we have.

288
00:15:07,456 --> 00:15:10,639
Come on in, Blondie. Anyone come?
- Yes, that way.

289
00:15:10,706 --> 00:15:13,887
Come in darling and have a drink, just one.

290
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,300
Pour my favorite, Madelon. I'll be back.

291
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:20,607
Right away.
- Oh, look at this!

292
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,745
Boy!

293
00:15:32,302 --> 00:15:34,302
Ah, the jingle of the dice.

294
00:15:34,376 --> 00:15:36,802
What are you doing? Playing backgammon?
- No, dear, we're skating.

295
00:15:36,832 --> 00:15:39,859
You tease. Please sit down.
Don't let me disturb you.

296
00:15:40,911 --> 00:15:41,900
Boy.

297
00:15:42,426 --> 00:15:43,990
How's your mother?
Did she like the cake?

298
00:15:44,105 --> 00:15:46,876
She adored it but
I'm very cross with you.

299
00:15:46,889 --> 00:15:48,352
Did you hang up or were we cut off?

300
00:15:49,087 --> 00:15:50,018
It's your move.

301
00:15:51,869 --> 00:15:54,975
Darling? Introduce me.

302
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,258
I'm terribly sorry. Mr. Murchenson.

303
00:15:57,573 --> 00:15:58,873
It's your move.
- How do you do?

304
00:15:59,778 --> 00:16:02,399
Murchenson! Oil!

305
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:05,292
The girls were talking about you
in the dressing room the other day.

306
00:16:05,305 --> 00:16:09,562
We didn't know if it was
20 or 30 thousand barrels.

307
00:16:09,835 --> 00:16:12,430
Isn't that what you get oil in?
- Darling, darling, darling.

308
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:14,025
Double. It's your move.

309
00:16:14,256 --> 00:16:16,766
Thirty thousand barrels
if it interests you.

310
00:16:17,669 --> 00:16:18,510
Oh.

311
00:16:25,113 --> 00:16:26,601
I'm so glad to know.

312
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:31,544
- Nice?
- Uh huh.

313
00:16:32,397 --> 00:16:33,470
It's your move.

314
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:35,970
You dirty old man!

315
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:39,029
Just a hurried tub
after the rush of the day.

316
00:16:39,085 --> 00:16:42,363
It's such a comfort.
Oh, Madelon, Madelon.

317
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:44,779
- How am I doing?
- Do we have any cigarettes?

318
00:16:44,834 --> 00:16:45,708
Oui, Madame.

319
00:16:45,712 --> 00:16:49,446
Cigarettes, are you crazy?
I'm going to kill you right now.

320
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:50,109
You're crazy.

321
00:16:50,172 --> 00:16:53,600
Stop it! Blondie, I'll sock you
in the nose if you don't stop it.

322
00:16:53,696 --> 00:16:57,000
We're children no longer, Blondie.
Silly child!

323
00:16:58,884 --> 00:17:02,098
Madelon, mon bain, tout suite.
- Madame? Froid ou chaud?

324
00:17:02,178 --> 00:17:03,208
Froid.

325
00:17:03,254 --> 00:17:08,590
- Tres bien.
- Oh, je suis si fatigue! - Ca ne m'etonne pas, Madame.

326
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,010
- Votre mere va bien aurjourdhui?
- Tres bien, merci.

327
00:17:21,259 --> 00:17:22,919
Hello, little fella.

328
00:17:24,106 --> 00:17:26,106
How are you doing, kiddie?

329
00:17:26,123 --> 00:17:28,123
What's your name?

330
00:17:28,131 --> 00:17:31,129
Don't be scared of me.
I'm not going to bite you.

331
00:17:31,146 --> 00:17:32,417
How cute.

332
00:17:36,606 --> 00:17:37,775
Do you like dogs?

333
00:17:38,275 --> 00:17:39,690
I like that kind.

334
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:41,671
They come from China, don't they?

335
00:17:42,069 --> 00:17:43,429
China. Yes, I believe they do.

336
00:17:43,853 --> 00:17:44,883
What part of China?

337
00:17:46,585 --> 00:17:47,536
All over.

338
00:17:47,595 --> 00:17:49,595
By the size of China,

339
00:17:50,315 --> 00:17:52,518
there must be a lot of them
if they're all over China.

340
00:17:53,916 --> 00:17:57,461
You don't suppose there's any truth
in the rumor that Chinamen eat dogs?

341
00:17:57,961 --> 00:17:59,077
I hadn't heard that.

342
00:17:59,272 --> 00:18:01,690
There couldn't be any possible connection

343
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:04,481
between chow mein and chow dogs?

344
00:18:04,981 --> 00:18:06,394
I don't know about that.

345
00:18:06,642 --> 00:18:08,894
- It would be kind of silly, wouldn't it?
- Yes, it would.

346
00:18:09,241 --> 00:18:11,241
That's what I thought.
Thank you very much.

347
00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:15,318
Clever, these Chinese.

348
00:18:17,604 --> 00:18:18,751
I beg you pardon?

349
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:21,090
I didn't say anything.
I didn't say a word.

350
00:18:27,582 --> 00:18:28,611
Who's that girl?

351
00:18:30,076 --> 00:18:31,111
I don't know.

352
00:18:32,705 --> 00:18:33,891
I like blondes.

353
00:18:34,739 --> 00:18:35,800
How about tonight?

354
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:38,889
Not so bad.
Not so bad.

355
00:18:39,161 --> 00:18:41,161
Hi, hi, you're doing swell.
- Hey.

356
00:18:41,271 --> 00:18:43,271
Who is that gink?

357
00:18:45,085 --> 00:18:47,374
- Gink?
- Yes, the one who was just here.

358
00:18:48,137 --> 00:18:50,690
That was only Larry Belmont.

359
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:54,154
You mean to say you don't know Larry Belmont?

360
00:18:54,765 --> 00:18:59,618
He made four million in the market himself.
- Goody goody! I like him.

361
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:03,205
Of course, you like Larry.
Everyone likes Larry.

362
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:06,833
I guess I better be going home.

363
00:19:06,934 --> 00:19:10,587
- Must you go, Blondie?
- Yes and thanks, Lottie.

364
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:14,216
- Lurlene, please.
- Well, Lurlene then.

365
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:15,626
Gee, this is swell here.

366
00:19:15,826 --> 00:19:18,636
Do you think I could come up and
see you one day when your friends are out?

367
00:19:18,838 --> 00:19:21,313
Yes, do. Give me a buzz.
My name's in the book.

368
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,792
As Lurlene Cavanaugh.

369
00:19:23,824 --> 00:19:24,671
Yes.

370
00:19:25,018 --> 00:19:27,018
OK and thanks a lot.

371
00:19:27,518 --> 00:19:29,994
- You can find your way out, can't you dear?
- Yes, it's right out there.

372
00:19:30,087 --> 00:19:32,436
- Blondie, you can't go like that.
- Why not?

373
00:19:32,495 --> 00:19:33,845
No, of course not, honey.

374
00:19:34,345 --> 00:19:37,652
Madelon, donnez-moi cette jacket.

375
00:19:37,686 --> 00:19:40,471
Et ce chapeau.

376
00:19:40,496 --> 00:19:42,496
Le petit chapeau, Madame?

377
00:19:42,513 --> 00:19:43,240
Oui, Oui.

378
00:19:43,258 --> 00:19:45,564
- Thanks. I'll let you have it back.
- You don't have to.

379
00:19:45,572 --> 00:19:47,069
You don't mean to say you're
going to give it to me?

380
00:19:47,086 --> 00:19:49,418
- Of course, I'm finished with it.
- Aren't you a peach!

381
00:19:50,284 --> 00:19:53,559
Wow! I bet I look kind of hot in this.

382
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:58,190
Oh, Lurlene, do I have to go?
I don't want to. I like it here.

383
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:00,062
Blondie,

384
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:02,350
if I introduce you to my friends,

385
00:20:03,138 --> 00:20:05,561
will you promise not to make any cracks?

386
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:09,730
- Me?
- You know, about uptown.

387
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,719
Of course I wouldn't if you said not.

388
00:20:11,727 --> 00:20:13,111
I'm up at Lurlene's now.

389
00:20:13,348 --> 00:20:14,803
She's got to go to the show.

390
00:20:16,126 --> 00:20:17,826
What?

391
00:20:19,929 --> 00:20:21,487
...all grown up.

392
00:20:22,165 --> 00:20:24,750
- Blondie, I'm so glad to see you again.
- Wait a minute, wait a minute.

393
00:20:24,775 --> 00:20:25,725
Wait a minute. What's this?

394
00:20:25,784 --> 00:20:26,684
- Me?
- Yes, you.

395
00:20:26,709 --> 00:20:27,481
Larry?

396
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:30,025
- What are you doing for dinner?
- Dinner? I've had it.

397
00:20:30,042 --> 00:20:31,317
What's the idea?

398
00:20:31,325 --> 00:20:34,921
I got to get a girl for Murchenson.
He's big business. All the oil in Oklahoma.

399
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:36,788
Don't you think you might
consult me about plans, dear?

400
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,176
Don't be silly. What's Josephine's number?

401
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,804
You're not going to call her. I'll call someone.

402
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,600
- Yes, you will.
- I could go if you wanted me to.

403
00:20:45,671 --> 00:20:48,351
That's great. She's cute.

404
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,768
- Thank you, mister.
- Mister yourself.

405
00:20:49,776 --> 00:20:51,776
Unfortunately, Blondie has to leave.

406
00:20:52,022 --> 00:20:54,056
- Come on, Blondie.
- Oh no, she doesn't.

407
00:20:54,107 --> 00:20:56,107
I'm going to talk her out of it.
How about it?

408
00:20:56,149 --> 00:20:59,237
- I don't really have to go.
- But you said you did.

409
00:20:59,405 --> 00:21:01,405
- Did I?
- Are you kidding?

410
00:21:01,523 --> 00:21:02,900
You don't have to go, do you?

411
00:21:03,307 --> 00:21:07,746
- If Lurlene says I do, I do. I guess I better go.
- No, that's silly.

412
00:21:07,852 --> 00:21:11,249
- Stop it, Larry, or I'll be cross.
- You're frightening your little friend.

413
00:21:11,273 --> 00:21:12,548
What's the matter?
Aren't you two speaking?

414
00:21:12,632 --> 00:21:14,632
We've been chums ever since we were kids.

415
00:21:14,937 --> 00:21:19,132
- What are you sore about, Lurlene?
- I'm not sore. You're so absurd.

416
00:21:19,224 --> 00:21:21,086
You know perfectly well you promised
your mother you'd be home.

417
00:21:21,103 --> 00:21:23,700
- When?
- Over the telephone just now.

418
00:21:23,788 --> 00:21:26,289
Are you screwy?
You know we have no telephone.

419
00:21:26,407 --> 00:21:27,794
Screwy? Don't be rude.

420
00:21:29,142 --> 00:21:30,574
You're the one that's rude!

421
00:21:30,658 --> 00:21:32,878
- Now, Blondie, please.
- Don't get fresh with me.

422
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:36,869
If you have come up in the world, you
don't have to make a fool out of me.

423
00:21:36,877 --> 00:21:37,735
Blondie...

424
00:21:40,474 --> 00:21:41,591
The poor little kid.

425
00:21:41,591 --> 00:21:43,591
- Larry, come here.
- No, no.

426
00:21:43,633 --> 00:21:45,633
I don't like that. I don't like it.

427
00:21:45,786 --> 00:21:46,936
Larry!

428
00:21:57,768 --> 00:21:59,189
- Come here.
- Let me go.

429
00:21:59,299 --> 00:22:01,299
- Cut it out.
- Come here. Stop it.

430
00:22:01,358 --> 00:22:03,358
Stop it. Who do you think you are?

431
00:22:03,375 --> 00:22:04,970
- Who do you think you are?
- Mussolini.

432
00:22:05,236 --> 00:22:06,894
- You're...
- Say it.

433
00:22:07,131 --> 00:22:08,717
- I'm too much of a lady.
- I was afraid of that.

434
00:22:08,751 --> 00:22:09,949
Let me tell you something.

435
00:22:09,966 --> 00:22:11,201
You can't tell me anything. I'm going.

436
00:22:11,226 --> 00:22:12,552
- Come here.
- Stop it.

437
00:22:15,452 --> 00:22:17,452
What do you mean running out
of people's houses that way?

438
00:22:17,596 --> 00:22:19,596
Not saying goodbye, no hat or coat?

439
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:22,020
Didn't your mother teach you
any better than that?

440
00:22:24,735 --> 00:22:25,834
What you need is a drink.

441
00:22:25,902 --> 00:22:26,819
I don't drink.

442
00:22:26,836 --> 00:22:27,858
- Smoke?
- No.

443
00:22:28,358 --> 00:22:29,669
- Stay out late nights?
- No.

444
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:31,541
- Like the boys?
- No.

445
00:22:31,575 --> 00:22:33,600
- Do you eat? - Yes.

446
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:34,483
That's all right.
I'll take you out to dinner.

447
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:36,918
- You're fresh.
- Come here.

448
00:22:37,948 --> 00:22:38,990
Where do you live?

449
00:22:39,209 --> 00:22:41,055
- Uptown on the east side.
- Married or single?

450
00:22:41,097 --> 00:22:41,990
Pooh!

451
00:22:43,701 --> 00:22:45,200
Thank you very much.

452
00:22:51,268 --> 00:22:52,276
Seriously,

453
00:22:52,852 --> 00:22:56,158
Lurlene's all right. She just gets
a little temperamental every once in a while.

454
00:22:56,539 --> 00:22:57,490
I guess that's it.

455
00:22:57,982 --> 00:23:01,693
- Just because she's in the Follies.
- She's very, very good in the Follies.

456
00:23:02,036 --> 00:23:03,850
- I'd like to see her.
- And so you shall.

457
00:23:03,884 --> 00:23:05,774
- I'll take you myself tonight.
- No, I'm going home.

458
00:23:05,791 --> 00:23:07,657
- How?
- I'll walk. - We'll walk.

459
00:23:15,331 --> 00:23:17,626
- Going down?
- You are!

460
00:23:22,822 --> 00:23:24,050
Going down?

461
00:23:31,612 --> 00:23:35,810
I've always adored yachts. Do you know Monty Bone's yacht?

462
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:39,600
- Monty Bone? - I forget how many tons but
a veritable palace on the sea.

463
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:41,252
"She was a village maiden,
Her life was full of pain.

464
00:23:41,264 --> 00:23:43,718
She met her little Larry
And she lost her name.

465
00:23:43,742 --> 00:23:47,621
..again!" I want you to meet my friend,
Miss Blondie McClune, Miss Cavanaugh.

466
00:23:47,663 --> 00:23:50,575
I've been dying for you two to meet...socially.
- Oh, Larry!

467
00:23:50,958 --> 00:23:53,697
Blondie, what on earth made you
fly away like that?

468
00:23:53,739 --> 00:23:55,196
Like a veritable sky rocket.

469
00:23:55,204 --> 00:23:58,708
Lottie, you're a scream.
Doesn't she make you laugh? - Yes, she does.

470
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:00,700
She was always like that.
Even in the store.

471
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:04,422
Just out of nowhere she'd get so hotsy-totsy,
even the customers would laugh.

472
00:24:28,106 --> 00:24:29,325
Lurlene,

473
00:24:29,494 --> 00:24:32,611
I asked your girlfriend to go to the
Follies with me. You don't mind, do you?

474
00:24:33,111 --> 00:24:37,622
Why no, I think it would be charming.
If Blondie can go.

475
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:40,900
Hi, hi, I'm there already.
What about this though?

476
00:24:41,005 --> 00:24:43,226
You look great. She'll lend you
a hat and coat. Won't you, darling?

477
00:24:43,234 --> 00:24:45,234
- Why, certainly.
- She's a peach.

478
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:47,734
- Bye, mister.
- Mister yourself.

479
00:24:48,234 --> 00:24:50,234
I think I can find something.

480
00:24:50,921 --> 00:24:51,950
Cute?

481
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:54,300
Yes, I like blondes.

482
00:24:54,334 --> 00:24:57,090
Lottie, can I come around back
of the stage and see you after?

483
00:24:57,429 --> 00:24:59,429
- I hope you will.
- Oh, swell.

484
00:24:59,437 --> 00:25:00,995
- How do I look?
- Charming.

485
00:25:01,113 --> 00:25:01,990
Goody!

486
00:25:24,702 --> 00:25:28,700
Say, there's a dame in the box
with Larry. A blonde.

487
00:25:31,284 --> 00:25:33,337
She happens to be a friend of mine.

488
00:25:33,396 --> 00:25:36,233
Oh yeah? Well, you're a bigger sap
than I thought you were.

489
00:25:42,502 --> 00:25:46,565
Aren't they cute? Look at them.
They really are something.

490
00:25:48,531 --> 00:25:50,455
Bye, pal.

491
00:25:50,489 --> 00:25:53,162
Say, how much does do they pay
those girls to be in the show?

492
00:25:53,187 --> 00:25:55,187
About 50, 60, 70 dollars a week.

493
00:25:55,212 --> 00:25:57,212
- Do you think you could fix it up for me?
- Sure.

494
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:59,491
I'm not pretty enough for a show, am I?

495
00:25:59,499 --> 00:26:01,499
Yes you are. You're very pretty indeed.

496
00:26:01,855 --> 00:26:04,145
- Thank you, mister.
- Mister yourself.

497
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:06,170
I wish I could dance like that.

498
00:26:08,399 --> 00:26:09,530
Oh, hello.

499
00:26:09,555 --> 00:26:11,478
- Hello, Larry.
- How are you?

500
00:26:11,478 --> 00:26:13,478
I want you to meet a friend of mine,
Miss McClune.

501
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:16,444
This is the man who owns the whole show.

502
00:26:16,452 --> 00:26:19,140
- Glad, I'm sure.
- How do you do, sir.

503
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,624
She's never been backstage and
she would like to go backstage.

504
00:26:23,074 --> 00:26:26,481
I think that can be arranged.
How about right now?

505
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,510
Oh, fine. That would be great.

506
00:26:40,376 --> 00:26:43,456
Will you ask him to put a word in for me?
- Right now?

507
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,626
- Yeah.
- All right. You stay right here.

508
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:52,048
- How about that kid for the show?
- No, we're full up now.

509
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:53,051
Oh, come on. She's cute.

510
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:56,094
- What is this, another one?
- This only makes six.

511
00:26:56,642 --> 00:26:58,642
- You fellas kill me.
- Go ahead.

512
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:00,849
I'll see what I can do. O'Brien!

513
00:27:03,023 --> 00:27:04,605
See if we can use this girl.

514
00:27:08,577 --> 00:27:10,040
Turn around.

515
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:16,197
- Lift them up. - I just want to see
if you're knock-kneed.

516
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,419
Me? I should say not.

517
00:27:18,945 --> 00:27:22,815
All right. I suppose you ought to drop in
about 10 o'clock tomorrow morning.

518
00:27:22,849 --> 00:27:24,407
Thanks, that's swell.

519
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:32,953
- Ha, ha, ha yourself. - I just got your
girlfriend a job in the Follies.

520
00:27:32,953 --> 00:27:33,298
- Why?
- She's cute.

521
00:27:34,654 --> 00:27:35,886
Yes, she is.

522
00:27:35,911 --> 00:27:37,911
How about a party tonight?
She wants to see life.

523
00:27:37,928 --> 00:27:41,139
- She should see it with you.
- Don't be mean.

524
00:27:42,674 --> 00:27:43,988
I'll meet you over in the speak.

525
00:27:44,404 --> 00:27:46,630
I'll meet you, Larry,
but nothing doing if she comes.

526
00:27:46,647 --> 00:27:49,522
- Why not?
- Because I...

527
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:53,151
- Oh, Larry. - I'll bring her if I want to.
You're trying to run things.

528
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:56,070
- No one could run you. - There's a certain
amount of truth in that.

529
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:59,574
- Come on, you're on.
- Watch your beads. - Fresh.

530
00:28:13,209 --> 00:28:16,162
- Say, you're going swell, Kiddie!
- Quiet.

531
00:28:56,729 --> 00:28:58,770
Say, what's the matter with her?

532
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:08,935
- Well, the truth: There she is.
- Kiddie! What's eating you?

533
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:12,000
- Nothing. - We thought you were
awfully hotsy-totsy just now.

534
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:13,493
- Who's we?
- Larry and me.

535
00:29:14,486 --> 00:29:17,063
- Hey, Lottie...
- Lurlene.

536
00:29:17,071 --> 00:29:21,781
I've got a chance to get in the show.
Isn't that great? I owe it all to you, kiddie.

537
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:24,001
I like that. I wonder if I could
have one like that.

538
00:29:24,026 --> 00:29:26,945
Blondie, please, I'm trying to make a change.

539
00:29:28,471 --> 00:29:31,374
- Would you be sore if I got in the show?
- Of course not.

540
00:29:31,399 --> 00:29:34,210
Hi, hi, that's great! Say, I love this racket.

541
00:29:34,541 --> 00:29:37,880
This is swell. Ooh boy!

542
00:29:38,449 --> 00:29:41,801
Matches. Hey, Lottie, will you
show me the ropes?

543
00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:43,242
My name is Lurlene.

544
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:45,250
Oh, I'm sorry. Say, I have to
be here at 10.

545
00:29:45,275 --> 00:29:50,560
Old man Popeye thinks I'm kind of cute.
Look. I'm smoking.

546
00:29:54,143 --> 00:29:58,109
I guess I better be going.
Lottie, I'll see you after.

547
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,111
- Who said so?
- Larry.

548
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:05,742
Say, didn't he ask you? If he didn't, I'll make him.
He'll do anything I say. He's cute.

549
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:08,578
Sorry Blondie, but I have another engagement.
- There's blood all over the floor.

550
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:12,623
That's just too tough. It would have been nice
to have you with us. - ...in tears.

551
00:30:12,723 --> 00:30:14,111
Well, toodle-loo.

552
00:30:14,111 --> 00:30:17,879
So long, cuties! I'll be seeing you,
I'm going to be in the show!

553
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:19,505
Lurlene?

554
00:30:19,536 --> 00:30:23,908
The cards say that little blonde girl is
unconsciously not being a friend of yours.

555
00:30:23,908 --> 00:30:27,680
- I don't believe in fortunes.
- Not Larry Belmont's? - Oh shut up!

556
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:37,990
- Looking for Larry?
- What?

557
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,527
- Are you looking for Larry?
- Yes, I'm looking for Larry.

558
00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:42,800
- He's up front.
- Thanks.

559
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:49,327
- No smoking, please.
- Get a load of this!

560
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,300
Oh, that's pretty.

561
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:57,168
What a cute little hat! Yes?

562
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:05,051
- Hello! - Hello. Where have you been?
I've been looking for you.

563
00:31:05,090 --> 00:31:06,390
- Good night, dear.
- Good night, Larry.

564
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,176
Where are we going?

565
00:31:11,201 --> 00:31:13,201
I know a nice quiet little speakeasy.

566
00:31:13,218 --> 00:31:16,351
Where they have soft music,
soft lights and hard liquor.

567
00:31:18,361 --> 00:31:20,361
I'll be seeing you later...queens.

568
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:21,494
So long!

569
00:31:31,851 --> 00:31:33,478
That man's here again.

570
00:31:34,232 --> 00:31:36,232
Go ahead, go on.

571
00:31:39,293 --> 00:31:41,668
- Good evening, Mr. Belmont.
- Hello, Arthur.

572
00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:46,217
- How about a little cold champagne?
- Certainly. Private room or your usual table?

573
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:48,300
- No, I think the bar.
- Go right ahead, sir.

574
00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:50,839
Bar? I've often heard of one of those things
but I've never seen one at all.

575
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,976
- There's Larry.
- Hello, Larry.

576
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:00,030
- Hello. - Here we are again. - Hurry back.

577
00:32:00,050 --> 00:32:02,900
Aren't you afraid you'd get pinched?
I'll have a strawberry sundae.

578
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,155
Make it two strawberry sundaes.

579
00:32:21,269 --> 00:32:25,137
When our eyes met we both knew

580
00:32:26,642 --> 00:32:31,128
Something unsaid, something true.

581
00:32:31,798 --> 00:32:36,850
Now through the hours we have danced.

582
00:32:36,943 --> 00:32:41,523
I feel the music answer

583
00:32:41,599 --> 00:32:46,936
The rhythm the rapture the urge

584
00:32:47,029 --> 00:32:52,481
So why don't you take me?
Why do you wait?

585
00:32:52,557 --> 00:32:56,883
Dance to the beat of my heart.

586
00:32:56,908 --> 00:33:02,149
The night is passing swiftly.

587
00:33:02,259 --> 00:33:07,261
Why did we ever part?

588
00:33:07,286 --> 00:33:11,700
One little look one little word

589
00:33:11,742 --> 00:33:15,746
The word I am yearning to hear.

590
00:33:16,831 --> 00:33:18,500
You're a darling.

591
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:24,023
Don't, mister. If you don't mean it.

592
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:11,320
- Was he always like that?
- Oh yes, he was always like that.

593
00:34:11,330 --> 00:34:16,242
You know, my father's Irish and French.
And my mother, she's Scotch and English.

594
00:34:16,278 --> 00:34:20,663
It's a good combination to come from.
Very good stock. Very fine stock.

595
00:34:21,293 --> 00:34:23,728
My sister, you know she's married
to my brother-in-law. - Oh?

596
00:34:24,473 --> 00:34:26,938
- What does he do?
- Oh, he doesn't like to work.

597
00:34:26,955 --> 00:34:30,300
He's very sensitive.
He says work gets on his nerves.

598
00:34:30,707 --> 00:34:33,882
He'd like to be an inventor, he said.
- Please, Mr. Belmont, we're closing now.

599
00:34:33,907 --> 00:34:35,907
And they have the cutest little
baby you ever saw.

600
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:37,907
Awfully cute. The baby's really smart.

601
00:34:37,949 --> 00:34:41,517
The baby really is. And you know, my brother...

602
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:51,652
-You're going to love Pa.
-I'd like to meet him.

603
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:03,931
Hi! You drive like a streak!

604
00:35:03,956 --> 00:35:07,012
- Comes the dawn.
- I saw the dawn last New Year's.

605
00:35:07,977 --> 00:35:10,677
Say, I thought you were going to be fresh
when we first started out.

606
00:35:10,761 --> 00:35:13,170
But I took a chance because I liked you.

607
00:35:13,212 --> 00:35:14,446
And I like you too.

608
00:35:14,514 --> 00:35:17,603
Don't you know there are certain girls
can stop men from being fresh

609
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:19,241
just because they're certain girls?

610
00:35:20,345 --> 00:35:21,998
Understand me?
- Yes.

611
00:35:22,006 --> 00:35:26,103
I think you're grand, mister.
- Mister yourself.

612
00:35:27,346 --> 00:35:29,346
This is swell.

613
00:35:34,943 --> 00:35:35,990
Home.

614
00:35:42,430 --> 00:35:43,806
I like you.

615
00:36:00,010 --> 00:36:03,849
- Good morning.
- Darling, the house detective.

616
00:36:04,194 --> 00:36:07,812
Hi, Pa, this is Larry. He's seeing me home.

617
00:36:08,386 --> 00:36:10,386
Something tells me, Madame,
that you better get down.

618
00:36:10,437 --> 00:36:13,806
What do you mean?

619
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,161
Hi kiddie!

620
00:36:15,449 --> 00:36:18,766
Pa, this is Larry. Larry Lou.

621
00:36:18,766 --> 00:36:20,766
So you're Pa. She's been talking
about her pa all evening.

622
00:36:20,859 --> 00:36:22,690
Can you walk now, chicken?

623
00:36:22,706 --> 00:36:23,690
Come, Blondie.

624
00:36:23,724 --> 00:36:26,202
- Stand back. I'm all right.
- I think I better carry you.

625
00:36:26,702 --> 00:36:28,702
No, I don't think you ought to.

626
00:36:29,456 --> 00:36:30,912
So long, Larry.

627
00:36:30,954 --> 00:36:32,411
OK, baby, see you tomorrow.

628
00:36:32,572 --> 00:36:33,678
No, you won't.

629
00:36:34,178 --> 00:36:35,378
- Oh no?
- No.

630
00:36:35,598 --> 00:36:39,969
Mr. McClune, there's no need to act  like that.
She just had a little bit of champagne.

631
00:36:40,285 --> 00:36:41,621
She's perfectly all right.

632
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,300
Ouch!

633
00:36:43,453 --> 00:36:46,450
Now she's gone bumpty. It's that fresh
air after all that champagne.

634
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:49,580
Get up off that floor!

635
00:36:54,488 --> 00:36:56,539
Get out of here. You're intoxicated.

636
00:36:56,581 --> 00:36:58,385
I'm not intoxicated.
I'm just a little bit tight.

637
00:36:58,453 --> 00:37:01,782
Good night, Blondie. God bless.
Tell them all how good we've been.

638
00:37:03,404 --> 00:37:04,569
Goodbye, mister.

639
00:37:05,069 --> 00:37:06,386
Mister yourself.

640
00:37:10,066 --> 00:37:11,096
Blondie.

641
00:37:12,255 --> 00:37:13,127
Oh, Pa.

642
00:37:18,835 --> 00:37:20,371
You go to bed, Ma. I'll make the coffee.

643
00:37:20,379 --> 00:37:22,754
She's all right. She's only had a drink.
She ain't used to it.

644
00:37:22,991 --> 00:37:24,557
She's soused to the gills.

645
00:37:24,616 --> 00:37:26,386
My, she must have had a lot of fun.

646
00:37:26,521 --> 00:37:28,979
Did you see the coat she had on?
She must have been up at Lottie's.

647
00:37:29,097 --> 00:37:30,208
That's where she's been all right.

648
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:32,574
I wish I'd known she was going.
I'd have gone too.

649
00:37:32,616 --> 00:37:34,171
Just for a little fun.

650
00:37:34,188 --> 00:37:37,060
I'm going in the Follies.

651
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:38,473
- Is that where you've been, the Follies?
- Yes.

652
00:37:38,498 --> 00:37:42,509
Backstage, the speakeasy and the dressing room.
And that Larry Lou, oh can he dance.

653
00:37:42,899 --> 00:37:45,531
Why don't you take me.

654
00:37:45,853 --> 00:37:48,229
Why do you wait?
- Who is this man?

655
00:37:48,559 --> 00:37:50,940
Larry Belmont. It was grand.
Why didn't you ask him in?

656
00:37:50,957 --> 00:37:52,560
I asked you who is this man?

657
00:37:52,585 --> 00:37:54,255
I told you, Pa, Larry Belmont.

658
00:37:54,306 --> 00:37:55,175
Where did you meet him?

659
00:37:55,234 --> 00:37:57,166
I met him up at Lottie's.
He's a peach.

660
00:37:57,183 --> 00:37:59,183
Does it occur to you that
you're a decent girl

661
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:01,140
with a decent home and decent parents?

662
00:38:01,199 --> 00:38:02,823
I know. What's the matter, Pa?

663
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,457
How dare you stand there and
ask me what's the matter!

664
00:38:04,601 --> 00:38:06,873
When you've kept your entire family up
all night waiting for you.

665
00:38:06,949 --> 00:38:09,717
Thinking you might be hurt. Do you know
we've telephoned everywhere?

666
00:38:09,751 --> 00:38:10,969
Do you know I've been to the police?

667
00:38:11,037 --> 00:38:13,317
You didn't have to do that. I thought
you knew I was up with Lottie.

668
00:38:13,334 --> 00:38:16,023
You were with this man.
Where did you go with him?

669
00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:18,047
I told you I went to the Follies
and then...

670
00:38:18,055 --> 00:38:21,278
And then where? 
Then where did you go with him?

671
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,280
- Don't talk to me like that, Pa.
- Talk to you?

672
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:26,033
I ought to thrash you.
- Oh, stop it!

673
00:38:26,050 --> 00:38:27,853
Shut up, Blondie.
Don't talk to your Pa like that.

674
00:38:27,865 --> 00:38:31,205
You better go and get some sleep. - Sleep?
She's due at the store in 3 hours.

675
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:34,213
It's not the first time she's been up
all night. What about last New Year's?

676
00:38:34,272 --> 00:38:37,545
The next time anything like this happens,
you can get out of this house and stay out.

677
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:38,596
Do you hear me?

678
00:38:38,825 --> 00:38:40,825
Anyone would think I'd committed a crime.

679
00:38:41,011 --> 00:38:42,797
Done something wrong.
- And did you?

680
00:38:42,873 --> 00:38:44,802
- No!
- You're drunk.

681
00:38:44,904 --> 00:38:46,710
This man is drunk. Do you know what
danger means?

682
00:38:46,719 --> 00:38:48,096
- With him?
- Yes, with him.

683
00:38:48,096 --> 00:38:50,472
- He's a gentleman.
- He's a no-good drunken upstart.

684
00:38:50,548 --> 00:38:52,403
And you're never going to see him again,
do you understand me?

685
00:38:52,581 --> 00:38:55,029
- I'm going to see him if I want to.
- You're not. You're going to obey me.

686
00:38:55,113 --> 00:38:56,587
Or else get out of this house.
- All right.

687
00:38:56,655 --> 00:38:57,757
I'll get out of this house.

688
00:38:58,011 --> 00:39:00,384
I'll obey you but he was decent, Pa.

689
00:39:00,401 --> 00:39:01,737
Don't stand here and argue with me!

690
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:04,751
You must promise me never
to speak to him again or get out.

691
00:39:05,090 --> 00:39:06,510
All right, I'll get out.

692
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:08,900
I'm going to do what I want and I'm
going to live the way that I want!

693
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,381
And I'm going now.

694
00:39:10,389 --> 00:39:11,625
- Come here.
- Let me go.

695
00:39:11,990 --> 00:39:13,285
Blondie!

696
00:39:15,994 --> 00:39:17,006
Blondie!

697
00:39:36,458 --> 00:39:38,458
Lottie, I'd like to speak to you.

698
00:39:38,865 --> 00:39:40,865
- What about?
- May I come in?

699
00:39:41,001 --> 00:39:43,527
- No. Not now.
- It's important.

700
00:39:45,292 --> 00:39:47,147
All right. Come in then.

701
00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:53,457
- Well, what?
- I've quit home.

702
00:39:53,957 --> 00:39:56,134
- Why?
- I'm going on my own like you.

703
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:58,380
- What do you mean?
- In the Follies.

704
00:39:58,770 --> 00:40:01,587
- You're a fool.
- He said I'd do fine.

705
00:40:04,073 --> 00:40:05,454
And who's he?

706
00:40:06,336 --> 00:40:07,303
Larry.

707
00:40:08,881 --> 00:40:09,710
He did?

708
00:40:10,626 --> 00:40:11,578
Yes.

709
00:40:13,901 --> 00:40:16,747
And what other balloon juice
did he whisper until daylight?

710
00:40:17,544 --> 00:40:20,300
Lots. I like him.

711
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:24,360
- You do?
- Yes, and he likes me.

712
00:40:25,406 --> 00:40:26,980
He told you so?

713
00:40:29,764 --> 00:40:31,120
He was drunk!

714
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:39,708
It is true. Isn't it?

715
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:43,003
You are stuck on him, aren't you?

716
00:40:47,357 --> 00:40:49,059
Are  you blind?

717
00:40:49,559 --> 00:40:52,304
Why didn't you tell me?
Haven't we been pals?

718
00:40:53,796 --> 00:40:56,517
- He's never done this to me before.
- And I liked him.

719
00:40:57,017 --> 00:40:58,278
If I were his wife...

720
00:40:58,778 --> 00:41:02,008
I could go out and tell the world
how I feel and get some sympathy.

721
00:41:02,296 --> 00:41:03,345
But me?

722
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:08,028
I could just break my heart
and keep quiet about it.

723
00:41:08,767 --> 00:41:12,574
Or get the big "Ha, ha" from everybody.

724
00:41:18,378 --> 00:41:19,921
Poor Lottie.

725
00:41:20,724 --> 00:41:22,124
Poor Lottie.

726
00:41:25,397 --> 00:41:27,254
I've been an awful fool.

727
00:41:28,297 --> 00:41:30,297
Why didn't you tell me?

728
00:41:34,071 --> 00:41:36,350
You just don't tell those things.

729
00:41:36,714 --> 00:41:38,382
You could have told me, Mug.

730
00:41:43,726 --> 00:41:45,207
Get into bed, kid.

731
00:41:45,707 --> 00:41:47,707
And I'll tell you an earful.

732
00:41:50,003 --> 00:41:51,080
OK.

733
00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:53,639
The girl ain't bad.

734
00:41:56,454 --> 00:42:00,631
You better telephone the store at 8
and tell Mr. Robinson Blondie is sick.

735
00:42:02,539 --> 00:42:06,062
She's up on Park Avenue
having breakfast with Lottie.

736
00:42:07,486 --> 00:42:09,486
Champagne and caviar.

737
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:11,698
I wish I was a dame.

738
00:42:13,918 --> 00:42:15,691
You think she's with Lottie?

739
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:17,599
Sure, that's where she is.

740
00:42:19,157 --> 00:42:20,336
She'll be back.

741
00:42:22,038 --> 00:42:23,582
You lay off her, Pa.

742
00:42:24,082 --> 00:42:26,958
You give her a line like you did this
morning and she'll never come back.

743
00:42:30,138 --> 00:42:34,531
You're just an old fashioned father.
The kind you see in the movies.

744
00:42:34,544 --> 00:42:36,177
That stuff don't go anymore.

745
00:42:39,357 --> 00:42:41,865
Let the girl have her fling.
She's all right.

746
00:42:43,357 --> 00:42:46,345
I guess I am a bit old time.

747
00:43:25,029 --> 00:43:26,039
Hello, Pa.

748
00:43:27,328 --> 00:43:28,407
Hello, Blondie.

749
00:43:29,255 --> 00:43:30,303
I'm sorry.

750
00:43:30,566 --> 00:43:32,566
Darling, I'm sorry too.

751
00:43:32,634 --> 00:43:35,451
- I didn't mean to blow up.
- I shouldn't have lost my temper.

752
00:43:35,832 --> 00:43:38,121
I thought I'd stop in and see you
on the way to work.

753
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:41,557
- You're late for work?
- I figured this was more important.

754
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:44,226
- How did you know I was here?
- Where else could you be?

755
00:43:45,577 --> 00:43:48,105
- Like it?
- It's very nice.

756
00:43:48,952 --> 00:43:51,981
There's a big bedroom there and
a kitchen and maid's room there.

757
00:43:52,185 --> 00:43:52,917
Look.

758
00:43:53,069 --> 00:43:54,856
You can see all of New York from here.

759
00:43:55,831 --> 00:43:58,991
Would you believe there could be
such places? Come here.

760
00:44:00,151 --> 00:44:02,452
Look at this. You see that?

761
00:44:03,547 --> 00:44:05,692
That's where we live. Way off up there.

762
00:44:08,024 --> 00:44:09,040
Way off.

763
00:44:10,744 --> 00:44:11,820
Way off.

764
00:44:14,568 --> 00:44:15,702
Oh, Pa.

765
00:44:19,364 --> 00:44:23,724
I'm really going in the Follies. I've got
a date at the theater at 10. And I'm going.

766
00:44:27,719 --> 00:44:28,823
In the Follies?

767
00:44:29,603 --> 00:44:32,842
- Sure. What's wrong about that?
- Oh, nothing.

768
00:44:34,447 --> 00:44:37,738
- Blondie...
- Oh, Pa, don't start.

769
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:41,200
I'm not going to start. I've finished.

770
00:44:42,265 --> 00:44:44,615
- Not with me, Pa?
- No, Blondie.

771
00:44:45,251 --> 00:44:47,115
I'll never finish with you. Never.

772
00:44:48,285 --> 00:44:50,984
What I meant was I've finished
being an old time Pa.

773
00:44:51,755 --> 00:44:53,251
I've thought it over carefully.

774
00:44:53,751 --> 00:44:54,804
Fathers shouldn't...

775
00:44:55,533 --> 00:44:59,156
shouldn't try to stop a kid from doing
something she wants to do.

776
00:44:59,910 --> 00:45:01,910
That is, unless it's very wrong.

777
00:45:04,191 --> 00:45:07,109
And you never could do anything
very wrong, could you?

778
00:45:08,226 --> 00:45:10,659
- You know I couldn't, Pa.
- I know you couldn't.

779
00:45:11,159 --> 00:45:13,645
Is the Follies all right then?
They pay well.

780
00:45:14,026 --> 00:45:15,022
Where will you live?

781
00:45:16,576 --> 00:45:17,522
Well...

782
00:45:18,861 --> 00:45:20,353
here for the time being.

783
00:45:20,853 --> 00:45:22,107
Lottie said I could.

784
00:45:22,972 --> 00:45:26,108
You couldn't go in the Follies and...

785
00:45:26,303 --> 00:45:27,203
live home?

786
00:45:27,339 --> 00:45:28,357
No.

787
00:45:28,764 --> 00:45:32,242
It's such a long way uptown at night.

788
00:45:32,547 --> 00:45:34,998
but I'll come and see you
all the time though...

789
00:45:35,013 --> 00:45:37,013
We'll send your things down here.

790
00:45:37,258 --> 00:45:39,258
Unless you want to come
up home after them.

791
00:45:39,563 --> 00:45:41,257
I don't need anything from there.

792
00:45:41,401 --> 00:45:44,805
Lottie said she'd lend me everything.
Isn't she a pal?

793
00:45:44,810 --> 00:45:47,535
Yes, it's fine.

794
00:45:48,298 --> 00:45:49,394
It's really fine.

795
00:45:49,614 --> 00:45:51,153
Don't mind me, Blondie.

796
00:45:51,509 --> 00:45:54,068
I'm an old crab. I don't mean to be.

797
00:45:54,678 --> 00:45:57,137
It is fine. It's really fine.

798
00:45:57,671 --> 00:45:58,700
Well...

799
00:45:59,510 --> 00:46:00,873
Goodbye, Blondie. Good luck.

800
00:46:01,678 --> 00:46:04,363
Anyone would think I was going away
forever. Aren't you glad?

801
00:46:16,307 --> 00:46:20,799
Take care of my girl.
Take care of my baby.

802
00:46:23,142 --> 00:46:26,248
It's fine. It's really fine.

803
00:46:27,705 --> 00:46:28,748
I'll see you.

804
00:46:35,550 --> 00:46:36,514
It's fine.

805
00:46:57,423 --> 00:47:01,381
- Has he gone?
- Yes. He's gone.

806
00:47:05,042 --> 00:47:07,042
- Bless you.
- Thanks.

807
00:47:08,271 --> 00:47:12,225
If you're going to the theater, you better
hurry. I'll get you some practice clothes.

808
00:47:12,446 --> 00:47:15,687
Manon!
- Donnez-moi les...

809
00:47:16,335 --> 00:47:18,641
Oh, the practice pants.
Pour mademoiselle-la.

810
00:47:19,394 --> 00:47:22,032
Lottie, you certainly are a pal.

811
00:47:23,285 --> 00:47:26,615
I like you, Blondie.
I've always liked you.

812
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:29,368
So glad we're pals again.

813
00:47:30,250 --> 00:47:32,250
It sort of seems like home, doesn't it?

814
00:47:33,588 --> 00:47:35,021
But remember one thing.

815
00:47:35,275 --> 00:47:38,752
Hands off that Larry number.
- I promised you, didn't I?

816
00:47:39,549 --> 00:47:43,382
By the way, we're going on a yacht tonight.
Murchenson, the oil man.

817
00:47:43,836 --> 00:47:47,052
The palace. Palace on the sea!
- Goody.

818
00:47:47,548 --> 00:47:50,263
- We'll get you some clothes.
- Swell.

819
00:47:50,899 --> 00:47:53,222
What's the matter, Blondie?
Aren't you happy about going?

820
00:47:53,501 --> 00:47:54,836
Oh, sure.

821
00:47:56,031 --> 00:47:57,760
You don't have to if you don't want to.

822
00:47:58,023 --> 00:48:00,286
It's fine, Lottie.

823
00:48:00,786 --> 00:48:03,527
Really. It is.

824
00:48:04,410 --> 00:48:05,357
Fine.

825
00:48:25,188 --> 00:48:29,386
- It's a mackerel, I tell you!
- It is not, a mackerel!

826
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:37,018
- I tore my dress.
- It's not a tragedy, you can have it mended.

827
00:48:37,978 --> 00:48:39,813
- Hello hello! It's a pleasure to be aboard!
- Welcome.

828
00:48:39,830 --> 00:48:41,461
You know Miss McClune, don't you?

829
00:48:41,486 --> 00:48:43,257
He gave me a funny look the other day.
You remember?

830
00:48:43,274 --> 00:48:45,452
He's got naughty eyes!

831
00:48:45,469 --> 00:48:48,530
- You haven't by chance seen Larry here?
- He's in the back.

832
00:48:49,162 --> 00:48:51,866
I'll leave you two children alone.

833
00:48:52,546 --> 00:48:56,371
Hello, boy. Isn't this a divine boat?

834
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:59,040
- Divine.
- The palace on the sea.

835
00:49:00,264 --> 00:49:03,670
Why didn't you call me? I should
have come aboard with you.

836
00:49:04,206 --> 00:49:06,798
- Why did you bring her here?
- Why not?

837
00:49:07,292 --> 00:49:08,450
For Murchenson?

838
00:49:08,651 --> 00:49:10,651
- Why not? Jealous?
- Perhaps.

839
00:49:11,448 --> 00:49:13,500
What do you mean introducing her
to this racket?

840
00:49:13,948 --> 00:49:15,948
Racket? What are you talking about?

841
00:49:15,973 --> 00:49:17,973
She's a nice kid.
You're heading her off the track.

842
00:49:18,303 --> 00:49:23,023
I suppose you were holding her on the track.
With two arms. Like this, weren't you?

843
00:49:23,050 --> 00:49:25,775
- I've great respect for her. She's a decent kid.
- And I suppose I'm not.

844
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:27,305
I didn't say that.

845
00:49:27,805 --> 00:49:30,636
Why do you persist in making things
as uncomfortable as possible?

846
00:49:30,737 --> 00:49:32,370
You know as well as I do that...

847
00:49:32,497 --> 00:49:36,453
- Go on, say it. We're through.
- Bluntly, yes.

848
00:49:37,294 --> 00:49:40,582
I...I made arrangements today.

849
00:49:40,870 --> 00:49:44,461
- Money doesn't mean anything, Larry.
- I'm afraid it does.

850
00:49:44,737 --> 00:49:46,993
- Hello, Lurlene.
- Hello, Josephine.

851
00:49:47,035 --> 00:49:48,353
- How are you?
- Hello, dear.

852
00:49:48,387 --> 00:49:51,556
I see you've brought the...
charming little blonde with you.

853
00:49:51,564 --> 00:49:54,076
- She's very sweet.
- The Follies are very fortunate.

854
00:49:54,856 --> 00:49:57,561
- You're a pretty girl.
- Thanks.

855
00:50:01,122 --> 00:50:02,592
I like blondes.

856
00:50:03,652 --> 00:50:05,652
- I've never been on a yacht before.
- No?

857
00:50:05,711 --> 00:50:07,294
Steward, champagne. Hurry up.

858
00:50:08,729 --> 00:50:11,613
You must come often.
- Yes, I'd love to.

859
00:50:11,819 --> 00:50:14,282
- Hello. How's your pa? - OK.

860
00:50:14,442 --> 00:50:15,716
Would you like to take a look
around the ship?

861
00:50:15,741 --> 00:50:17,231
No, she doesn't want to take
a look around the ship.

862
00:50:17,238 --> 00:50:18,698
You don't want to take a look
around the ship, do you?

863
00:50:18,723 --> 00:50:19,685
What do you say?

864
00:50:20,109 --> 00:50:21,010
Wait a minute.

865
00:50:21,723 --> 00:50:23,171
I want to talk to this young lady.

866
00:50:23,383 --> 00:50:25,614
I'm an old friend of the family,
as you know.

867
00:50:25,698 --> 00:50:26,669
Are you serious?

868
00:50:26,711 --> 00:50:28,421
I was never more serious in my life.

869
00:50:30,026 --> 00:50:30,921
All right.

870
00:50:30,989 --> 00:50:32,031
- Wait.
- Wait a minute.

871
00:50:33,207 --> 00:50:35,929
- I want to talk to you.
- What about?

872
00:50:36,140 --> 00:50:39,057
- You're a nice kid. You ought
to watch your step. - Thanks.

873
00:50:39,534 --> 00:50:41,534
- I'm very fond of you.
- Thanks again.

874
00:50:41,822 --> 00:50:44,104
- I'm serious.
- Yes?

875
00:50:44,655 --> 00:50:47,357
You don't want to play around
with people like this. It doesn't mean a thing.

876
00:50:47,380 --> 00:50:49,402
If it doesn't mean anything,
what about Lurlene?

877
00:50:49,427 --> 00:50:51,290
I'd rather not discuss that. It's over.

878
00:50:51,315 --> 00:50:53,315
I don't want to talk to you.

879
00:50:53,340 --> 00:50:55,340
I'm going.

880
00:51:05,986 --> 00:51:09,212
What did you mean about Lurlene?
Has she been talking to you?

881
00:51:09,622 --> 00:51:11,756
I'm not saying. But you know what I mean.

882
00:51:11,780 --> 00:51:13,842
Indeed I do know what you mean.
And I understand you perfectly.

883
00:51:13,860 --> 00:51:14,990
Well that's that then.

884
00:51:15,027 --> 00:51:17,520
But don't you think you might give me
a chance for some explanation?

885
00:51:18,416 --> 00:51:21,850
I'm not in love with Lurlene. You know
what we were talking about last night.

886
00:51:21,860 --> 00:51:24,395
A certain kind of girls.
- I won't hear a word against Lurlene.

887
00:51:24,403 --> 00:51:26,726
I wouldn't say a word against Lurlene.
It would be silly.

888
00:51:26,734 --> 00:51:30,108
- Silly, when she loves you
the way she does? - I admit I'm wrong.

889
00:51:30,138 --> 00:51:32,138
- What good does that do her?
- None.

890
00:51:32,587 --> 00:51:35,534
I was just hoping it might help me
clear myself with you.

891
00:51:36,238 --> 00:51:38,700
- You're different.
- How am I different?

892
00:51:39,276 --> 00:51:40,750
I've been thinking about it all day.

893
00:51:40,827 --> 00:51:43,913
You see, I only have one feeling for you.
A feeling of respect and affection...

894
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,917
You're tired of Lurlene. And I'm just new.
- That's not true.

895
00:51:47,930 --> 00:51:49,423
- She's my friend.
- She's also my friend.

896
00:51:49,423 --> 00:51:50,878
I know that and so does everybody else.

897
00:51:50,954 --> 00:51:52,954
- All right then.
- All right then.

898
00:51:59,123 --> 00:52:01,640
- Now what?
- Oh, go away.

899
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:06,353
Break! What's the idea?

900
00:52:11,951 --> 00:52:14,736
Goodbye. Remember what I told you.

901
00:52:18,424 --> 00:52:19,414
Hi, Lurlene.

902
00:52:29,991 --> 00:52:33,338
- And you promised.
- I won't see him again.

903
00:52:37,376 --> 00:52:38,740
Tell me something.

904
00:52:40,198 --> 00:52:42,019
If we really were washed up,

905
00:52:43,723 --> 00:52:45,274
would you like him for yourself?

906
00:52:45,299 --> 00:52:46,969
Oh Lurlene, don't be silly.

907
00:52:48,604 --> 00:52:49,927
Come on, you can tell me.

908
00:52:50,656 --> 00:52:52,197
I don't know!

909
00:52:55,157 --> 00:52:56,099
We're pals.

910
00:52:56,989 --> 00:52:59,875
Come on, you can tell me.
- I tell you I don't know.

911
00:53:01,815 --> 00:53:04,744
I won't get sore. Come on, tell me.

912
00:53:08,221 --> 00:53:09,350
I guess I might.

913
00:53:11,894 --> 00:53:13,007
- You might?
- Yes.

914
00:53:14,974 --> 00:53:16,012
You might?

915
00:53:17,206 --> 00:53:19,426
You might?

916
00:53:27,281 --> 00:53:29,505
- Jim just the same, was he abroad?
- I'm going home.

917
00:53:30,115 --> 00:53:32,115
- Why home?
- I'm tired.

918
00:53:32,479 --> 00:53:34,479
Look here, you weren't very friendly just now.

919
00:53:34,835 --> 00:53:36,835
You won't get anywhere
with little Miss McClune.

920
00:53:36,956 --> 00:53:39,335
I'll promise you that. Good night.

921
00:54:03,304 --> 00:54:04,236
Please.

922
00:54:04,558 --> 00:54:06,558
We'd like this room if you don't mind.

923
00:54:08,169 --> 00:54:09,737
- Steward, steward.
- Yes, Madame.

924
00:54:09,788 --> 00:54:14,129
Can't you bring a boat or something?
I'm leaving for the shore.

925
00:54:14,154 --> 00:54:14,788
Yes, Ma'am.

926
00:54:14,839 --> 00:54:16,388
- Oh, steward.
- Yes, Madame.

927
00:54:16,795 --> 00:54:19,527
- Are you discreet?
- No, I'm English, Madame.

928
00:54:19,550 --> 00:54:21,665
Oh, no. I mean...

929
00:54:21,885 --> 00:54:24,824
Can you keep your trap shut about this?
- Yes, Madame.

930
00:54:25,020 --> 00:54:29,950
And can't you find some women's doodads
or something that we can wear?

931
00:54:30,034 --> 00:54:34,167
Ladies bathing suits only, Madame.
There's a boat leaving now, Madame.

932
00:54:34,180 --> 00:54:35,100
Thank you.

933
00:54:48,672 --> 00:54:51,251
Thank you for the loan of the dress,
Lurlene, and for everything else too.

934
00:54:52,802 --> 00:54:54,623
If I hadn't gone home on Mother's Day,

935
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:56,840
I wouldn't have you on my hands now.
I should have known better.

936
00:54:57,140 --> 00:54:58,322
I'm not on your hands.

937
00:54:58,347 --> 00:55:00,152
- I'm being blamed for everything.
- For what?

938
00:55:00,304 --> 00:55:03,863
For getting you in this racket.
For leading the precious white lamb astray.

939
00:55:04,333 --> 00:55:07,012
What kind of a line did you
give him anyway?

940
00:55:07,970 --> 00:55:09,970
I didn't give him any line.

941
00:55:09,978 --> 00:55:12,054
But he warned me.
- Yes, against me.

942
00:55:12,062 --> 00:55:17,001
- Oh no, he was grand about you.
- Grand about me? Grand? Grand?

943
00:55:18,030 --> 00:55:21,881
I know how you feel. Because
I know how I feel too.

944
00:55:21,968 --> 00:55:26,469
You don't have to tell me how you feel.
Didn't I see you? And you promised.

945
00:55:26,805 --> 00:55:28,880
I'll never see him again. Never never.

946
00:55:28,980 --> 00:55:31,182
Why not? Why not?

947
00:55:31,434 --> 00:55:33,434
He's lots of money.
He got you in the show.

948
00:55:33,586 --> 00:55:36,067
Why not?
- Because I promised you and...

949
00:55:36,796 --> 00:55:38,448
Because he belongs to you.

950
00:55:38,821 --> 00:55:40,415
Why don't you go home and forget it?

951
00:55:40,661 --> 00:55:41,887
I can't forget it.

952
00:55:42,243 --> 00:55:45,864
Be good enough to go home anyway.
I'm through with you for keeps.

953
00:55:46,942 --> 00:55:48,310
OK.

954
00:55:49,642 --> 00:55:50,959
Well, go home!

955
00:55:57,980 --> 00:56:02,213
Say, who are you ordering about? Maybe I don't
want to go home. Maybe I like it here.

956
00:56:02,836 --> 00:56:04,233
Everyone's laughing at you.
You don't know what it's all about.

957
00:56:05,967 --> 00:56:08,179
Go back to the store.
You don't belong here.

958
00:56:08,196 --> 00:56:10,054
- Maybe.
- Good night then.

959
00:56:10,792 --> 00:56:13,975
If you could only see yourself!
Trying to be something you're not.

960
00:56:13,980 --> 00:56:15,932
- Get out!
- I won't get out.

961
00:56:16,076 --> 00:56:17,744
You'll see if I don't know
what it's all about.

962
00:56:18,159 --> 00:56:21,482
I'll keep my promise to you about Larry.
But there are plenty of other men.

963
00:56:21,976 --> 00:56:23,865
And I'm going in for a big time, kiddie!

964
00:56:23,882 --> 00:56:24,989
- Oh, yes?
- Yes!

965
00:56:28,448 --> 00:56:32,493
Excuse me now, please.
Miss Lurlene Calabash.

966
00:56:32,703 --> 00:56:35,765
But I've an engagement on the poop deck
of this palace of the sea.

967
00:56:35,782 --> 00:56:38,333
With its owner, Mr. Murchenson.
- Cut it out, cut it out!

968
00:56:38,350 --> 00:56:41,252
I won't cut it out. You watch my smoke!

969
00:56:51,404 --> 00:56:53,020
Got a match?

970
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:36,849
- She's charming, Murchenson!
- I like blondes.

971
00:57:46,753 --> 00:57:50,238
I want you to take these up to
my mother. But be careful not to break them.

972
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:54,158
And this note too. You can take
them around the park if they want to go.

973
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:56,958
I shan't need you until theater time.

974
00:58:06,452 --> 00:58:09,090
- Is Miss McClune in?
- Yes, sir. Won't you come in?

975
00:58:13,342 --> 00:58:15,722
Miss McClune will be here, sir.
- Thank you.

976
00:58:23,271 --> 00:58:25,271
Hello.
- Hello, Larry.

977
00:58:25,771 --> 00:58:28,253
- I got your wire so I came.
- That was nice of you.

978
00:58:29,041 --> 00:58:30,176
Gee, that's uh...

979
00:58:30,583 --> 00:58:32,991
- Charming.
- Thanks. Won't you sit down?

980
00:58:33,491 --> 00:58:35,269
Not there. Here.

981
00:58:37,460 --> 00:58:38,222
Here?

982
00:58:38,315 --> 00:58:39,435
- Yes.
- Yes, ma'am.

983
00:58:39,935 --> 00:58:41,935
Will you have tea or a drink?

984
00:58:42,562 --> 00:58:45,752
- I think it had better be tea.
- Oh yes, tea. Tea.

985
00:58:47,030 --> 00:58:48,895
I've been reading about
your polo on Sunday.

986
00:58:49,149 --> 00:58:52,842
- Oh?
- Yes. Oh, Larry, I've someone coming.

987
00:58:53,049 --> 00:58:57,138
So if you don't mind being bored with me...
I won't say what I have to say until they come.

988
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:01,684
Oh. OK.

989
00:59:03,341 --> 00:59:05,341
By any chance,
have you an evening paper?

990
00:59:05,637 --> 00:59:07,637
Certainly. Evening paper, please.

991
00:59:10,112 --> 00:59:11,528
It's been three months now.

992
00:59:12,359 --> 00:59:14,743
- Since what?
- Since we've spoken to each other.

993
00:59:15,718 --> 00:59:18,585
Oh yes, that party on the yacht.
I remember.

994
00:59:19,653 --> 00:59:21,653
I haven't spoken to Lurlene since then.

995
00:59:22,043 --> 00:59:23,147
Neither have I.

996
00:59:24,495 --> 00:59:26,495
I don't hold any grudge against her.

997
00:59:26,944 --> 00:59:30,254
I shouldn't think you would.
You should feel very grateful to her.

998
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:32,762
After all, she introduced you
to the larger life.

999
00:59:33,805 --> 00:59:35,262
I am grateful to her.

1000
00:59:35,558 --> 00:59:36,606
Well, that's that.

1001
00:59:40,478 --> 00:59:42,091
The market's gone all to blazes.

1002
00:59:42,396 --> 00:59:45,616
It's good for the bears though.
I sold short today.

1003
00:59:47,658 --> 00:59:49,074
You're well advised.

1004
00:59:51,711 --> 00:59:52,637
I am.

1005
00:59:53,137 --> 00:59:54,173
Getting wiser.

1006
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:56,310
I always have been wise.

1007
00:59:57,176 --> 00:59:58,564
Yes, I think you have.

1008
01:00:02,278 --> 01:00:04,278
- Sugar?
- One.

1009
01:00:04,541 --> 01:00:06,683
- Cream?
- No, thank you.

1010
01:00:06,691 --> 01:00:07,508
Toast?

1011
01:00:08,203 --> 01:00:10,203
- Cinnamon?
- I think so.

1012
01:00:10,703 --> 01:00:12,703
You think so? I can smell it
all the way from here.

1013
01:00:12,897 --> 01:00:14,900
The customer's always right.

1014
01:00:17,009 --> 01:00:18,127
Not always.

1015
01:00:28,761 --> 01:00:30,761
What's on your mind?
I haven't got much time.

1016
01:00:31,261 --> 01:00:32,445
I'm boring you.

1017
01:00:32,945 --> 01:00:34,341
You couldn't bore me.

1018
01:00:34,756 --> 01:00:36,142
Situations bore me though.

1019
01:00:38,092 --> 01:00:40,305
I'm getting so I distrust everything
and everybody.

1020
01:00:42,306 --> 01:00:44,306
It's old age creeping up on me I guess.

1021
01:00:44,806 --> 01:00:46,806
- You look very well.
- So do you.

1022
01:00:47,103 --> 01:00:49,230
It isn't fair for one person
to have all that charm.

1023
01:00:50,662 --> 01:00:52,222
How does it feel to be a success?

1024
01:00:52,671 --> 01:00:53,586
Success?

1025
01:00:54,162 --> 01:00:56,882
Miss McClune wears this,
Miss McClune smokes that.

1026
01:00:57,382 --> 01:00:58,470
I've been reading about you.

1027
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:01,750
You're laughing at me.

1028
01:01:01,996 --> 01:01:03,665
Wouldn't want me to cry over you,
would you?

1029
01:01:04,165 --> 01:01:07,185
You couldn't cry over anyone.
Even if you tried.

1030
01:01:07,983 --> 01:01:09,293
You mean I'm not sincere?

1031
01:01:09,564 --> 01:01:10,557
No.

1032
01:01:12,261 --> 01:01:13,739
I was sincere with you.

1033
01:01:14,807 --> 01:01:15,852
And you know it.

1034
01:01:16,352 --> 01:01:18,624
- And now?
- Now's another day, isn't it?

1035
01:01:19,300 --> 01:01:22,201
- Yes. Funny, isn't it?
- Very funny. That's why I'm laughing.

1036
01:01:23,405 --> 01:01:25,609
It will be a lucky girl
who gets you seriously.

1037
01:01:25,660 --> 01:01:28,389
The lady who did get me seriously
turned out to be very lucky.

1038
01:01:28,770 --> 01:01:29,676
And who is that?

1039
01:01:30,269 --> 01:01:32,482
Well, if this isn't a palace of luck
in a circus,

1040
01:01:32,736 --> 01:01:33,978
I don't know what is.

1041
01:01:34,478 --> 01:01:37,099
Step up, boys and girls,
and take your chance on the bigger life.

1042
01:01:38,718 --> 01:01:39,599
Stop!

1043
01:01:40,699 --> 01:01:41,656
Stop it.

1044
01:01:47,465 --> 01:01:48,452
I'm sorry.

1045
01:01:54,350 --> 01:01:55,260
Wait!

1046
01:01:55,421 --> 01:01:57,421
Don't go. I asked her to come.

1047
01:01:57,929 --> 01:01:59,408
I'm sorry. Pardon me.

1048
01:01:59,704 --> 01:02:00,810
Lurlene!

1049
01:02:03,133 --> 01:02:06,661
Please come in. - What for?
- I want you to.

1050
01:02:07,879 --> 01:02:08,900
All right.

1051
01:02:13,997 --> 01:02:15,380
Just in time, Larry.

1052
01:02:17,152 --> 01:02:19,339
I told you to throw that thing away
six months ago.

1053
01:02:20,433 --> 01:02:23,886
No. You gave it to me.

1054
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:28,000
There.

1055
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:32,000
Thanks.

1056
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:33,025
I hope I'm not disturbing anything.

1057
01:02:36,501 --> 01:02:37,908
Looks like old home week.

1058
01:02:38,230 --> 01:02:40,476
Won't you sit down? Larry has to hurry.

1059
01:02:41,137 --> 01:02:44,082
Now that I'm here, it's a wonder he
doesn't jump right through the window.

1060
01:02:44,090 --> 01:02:46,090
I'm saving that till the market
reaches the bottom.

1061
01:02:46,370 --> 01:02:50,204
Your eyes are just a little bit...
watery, aren't they?

1062
01:02:50,680 --> 01:02:52,748
- I've been worried.
- Yes.

1063
01:02:53,694 --> 01:02:54,830
You look it.

1064
01:02:55,136 --> 01:02:57,657
I felt I was the cause of
breaking you and Larry up and...

1065
01:02:57,835 --> 01:02:58,698
Well?

1066
01:02:58,952 --> 01:03:02,925
We haven't spoken to each other,
either of us since that night on the yacht and...

1067
01:03:02,950 --> 01:03:06,370
I felt that I might be the means of
bringing you together again.

1068
01:03:07,143 --> 01:03:08,980
You know that you care for Larry and...

1069
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:11,580
I'm sure that Larry cares for you.

1070
01:03:11,780 --> 01:03:14,241
I don't know what I did
to him to make him change.

1071
01:03:14,419 --> 01:03:15,863
Yes, what was it, Larry?

1072
01:03:18,517 --> 01:03:19,747
What do you want me to say?

1073
01:03:21,604 --> 01:03:22,982
I want you to say that...

1074
01:03:23,482 --> 01:03:25,151
that you'll make it up with Lurlene.

1075
01:03:29,221 --> 01:03:32,580
I'm sorry. We understood one another perfectly.

1076
01:03:32,882 --> 01:03:34,750
Until you walked out we did.

1077
01:03:35,857 --> 01:03:38,394
- It was a mistake. It all started in fun
- Fun?

1078
01:03:39,903 --> 01:03:43,022
I don't mean to be unkind about this
thing but there was no real love in it.

1079
01:03:43,157 --> 01:03:45,350
You know that.
- How do you know?

1080
01:03:46,709 --> 01:03:48,300
You didn't love me.

1081
01:03:52,746 --> 01:03:54,049
That's true, Larry.

1082
01:03:54,846 --> 01:03:56,277
Did I ever say I loved you?

1083
01:03:58,058 --> 01:03:59,719
- No, you didn't.
- I didn't.

1084
01:04:00,931 --> 01:04:03,110
It's my fault and I'm terribly sorry.

1085
01:04:03,770 --> 01:04:05,610
I'll do anything in the world
to make amends.

1086
01:04:06,263 --> 01:04:09,351
I admire you, but to pretend to love you
would lead to all kinds of things.

1087
01:04:09,758 --> 01:04:10,776
It's been a mistake.

1088
01:04:11,149 --> 01:04:13,488
So why go on with it
for your sake as well as for mine?

1089
01:04:13,496 --> 01:04:14,619
But you did love her.

1090
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:16,720
You must have loved her before.
- Before what?

1091
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:27,770
You belong to Lurlene.

1092
01:04:28,448 --> 01:04:30,448
My dear child,
I don't belong to anybody.

1093
01:04:31,101 --> 01:04:33,101
I think we're taking this thing
much too seriously.

1094
01:04:34,254 --> 01:04:37,585
I know why you brought this about this afternoon.
It was a very sweet thought but it's impossible.

1095
01:04:38,636 --> 01:04:39,654
We're friends.

1096
01:04:40,536 --> 01:04:42,774
If there's anything in the world
I can do for either one of you kids,

1097
01:04:43,630 --> 01:04:44,770
please let me know.

1098
01:04:47,330 --> 01:04:48,215
Bye, darling.

1099
01:04:51,376 --> 01:04:53,073
I never saw you looking better in my life.

1100
01:04:53,149 --> 01:04:54,152
Thanks, Larry.

1101
01:05:00,232 --> 01:05:03,838
This big gay life isn't all it's cracked up
to be, is it? - Goodbye, mister.

1102
01:05:05,218 --> 01:05:06,483
Mister yourself.

1103
01:05:11,452 --> 01:05:13,741
Some champagne. Very cold.

1104
01:05:14,046 --> 01:05:16,046
Have you got some? Good.

1105
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:29,401
Have you got a date?

1106
01:05:29,901 --> 01:05:31,901
- Not till theater.
- Want a drink?

1107
01:05:32,401 --> 01:05:35,411
- Sure.
- I have some champagne coming. Very cold.

1108
01:05:35,430 --> 01:05:37,663
- What brand?
- Heidsieck.

1109
01:05:38,547 --> 01:05:39,949
I always use that.

1110
01:05:40,076 --> 01:05:42,076
- Yeah?
- Sure.

1111
01:05:46,509 --> 01:05:48,155
Hurt your hand?

1112
01:05:52,632 --> 01:05:53,130
How?

1113
01:05:53,210 --> 01:05:54,697
You know where you hold me
in the ballet?

1114
01:05:54,971 --> 01:05:56,869
That's where your nails have been
every night.

1115
01:05:57,691 --> 01:06:00,561
Tough. I've hated you.

1116
01:06:00,847 --> 01:06:02,244
You thought I was seeing Larry?

1117
01:06:02,507 --> 01:06:05,483
- You weren't, were you?
- I promised you, didn't I?

1118
01:06:08,550 --> 01:06:09,625
Swell.

1119
01:06:10,618 --> 01:06:12,125
Yes, it is nice, isn't it?

1120
01:06:13,278 --> 01:06:16,869
I'm having my apartment done
in silver and black. Modern.

1121
01:06:17,083 --> 01:06:19,327
- Oh, swell.
- Sure.

1122
01:06:19,564 --> 01:06:22,791
I bet it'll be fine. Lay that right here 
and we'll take care of it.

1123
01:06:23,646 --> 01:06:25,176
- Where is he?
- Who?

1124
01:06:26,244 --> 01:06:27,623
The big cheese.

1125
01:06:28,123 --> 01:06:30,123
- You mean Mr. Murchenson?
- Yes.

1126
01:06:30,843 --> 01:06:33,585
- He's duck shooting.
- Poor little ducks.

1127
01:06:36,739 --> 01:06:38,739
I could marry him if I wanted to.

1128
01:06:39,239 --> 01:06:41,630
- Oh, yeah?
- You don't believe me, do you?

1129
01:06:41,698 --> 01:06:43,315
- Sure.
- I'll prove it to you.

1130
01:06:43,815 --> 01:06:45,778
You remember that little document,

1131
01:06:45,786 --> 01:06:49,878
that private thing I told you to put in the..
- Bring Mr. Murchenson's last letter!

1132
01:06:52,074 --> 01:06:52,955
Where is it?

1133
01:06:56,082 --> 01:06:57,400
Here it is.

1134
01:06:57,759 --> 01:06:58,870
Bring me the telephone.

1135
01:06:59,684 --> 01:07:02,623
I wonder who that is? We'll see. Hello?

1136
01:07:03,117 --> 01:07:05,117
Hello? Yes, this is Blondie.

1137
01:07:05,617 --> 01:07:06,909
How are you doing?

1138
01:07:08,274 --> 01:07:12,007
Swell. Say, that's a nice coat
you've got on there. - It's tweed.

1139
01:07:12,091 --> 01:07:14,091
- I've got one like it in gray.
- Yeah?

1140
01:07:14,112 --> 01:07:17,137
Listen, come on over. Lurlene's here.

1141
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:19,932
- Say, I'm going.
- Don't be silly. Pipe down.

1142
01:07:19,960 --> 01:07:22,685
We're going on a pip!
Bring the whole crowd over.

1143
01:07:22,861 --> 01:07:25,045
And an orchestra! Say, that's
gonna be swell!

1144
01:07:25,060 --> 01:07:27,962
Come on over. All right, we'll wait for you.

1145
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:31,348
Are we going to have fun, or
are we going to have fun?

1146
01:07:31,361 --> 01:07:33,361
Why don't you marry him? It's millions.

1147
01:07:35,070 --> 01:07:37,070
I couldn't marry. Only for love.

1148
01:07:39,602 --> 01:07:41,956
And that's just flown out of the window.

1149
01:07:43,512 --> 01:07:47,585
- It's flown for you too, hasn't it?
- I'm used to it.

1150
01:07:48,228 --> 01:07:49,960
I wish I could get used to it.

1151
01:07:53,940 --> 01:07:55,340
Poor baby.

1152
01:07:58,168 --> 01:08:00,802
Here's how, kid.
- Here we go.

1153
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:06,000
Kiddies, come on in!
The party's going grand!

1154
01:08:07,810 --> 01:08:12,151
How are you? The evening's grand.

1155
01:08:52,045 --> 01:08:54,387
Ah, an orchestra!

1156
01:08:55,592 --> 01:08:57,592
What happened? I come in with a girl.

1157
01:08:57,832 --> 01:08:59,832
How are you, boys?

1158
01:09:08,350 --> 01:09:10,097
We'll discuss that later.

1159
01:09:10,510 --> 01:09:11,515
Where have you been, Jimmy?

1160
01:09:12,418 --> 01:09:14,418
I just come from Grand Hotel.

1161
01:09:14,828 --> 01:09:18,379
Don't ever take your gal
to see Grand Hotel.

1162
01:09:18,434 --> 01:09:20,931
One look at that guy Barrymore
and you're out.

1163
01:09:22,075 --> 01:09:23,464
You become a crumb.

1164
01:09:23,477 --> 01:09:25,477
Barrymore's got this or that.

1165
01:09:25,490 --> 01:09:27,347
I ain't got this or that.

1166
01:09:27,368 --> 01:09:29,368
And when you ain't got this or that,
you become negative.

1167
01:09:29,423 --> 01:09:30,932
And that's positive.

1168
01:09:39,473 --> 01:09:43,507
It gets me sore. A lot of girls rave
about that Barrymore profile.

1169
01:09:43,528 --> 01:09:46,658
I got more profile
than all the Barrymores put together.

1170
01:09:51,923 --> 01:09:54,244
What does it get me?

1171
01:09:54,265 --> 01:09:55,995
What does it get me? Now listen.

1172
01:09:56,033 --> 01:09:58,828
Don't take your girl
to see Grand Hotel

1173
01:09:58,874 --> 01:10:01,629
because one look at that Barrymore
and you're out.

1174
01:10:01,651 --> 01:10:03,651
Wait a minute. Let me diagnose.

1175
01:10:04,848 --> 01:10:07,075
The theater was dark.

1176
01:10:07,441 --> 01:10:08,684
There was a certain tension.

1177
01:10:09,789 --> 01:10:11,789
And he was seated.

1178
01:10:11,861 --> 01:10:15,126
Or rather she was. In fact we all was.

1179
01:10:17,834 --> 01:10:19,834
- So what?
- So what?

1180
01:10:24,160 --> 01:10:26,160
We were holding hands so cuddly,

1181
01:10:28,625 --> 01:10:31,056
when suddenly along the corridor,

1182
01:10:31,069 --> 01:10:33,288
who comes along but Barrymore?

1183
01:10:37,348 --> 01:10:39,834
Was he after pearls? No.

1184
01:10:40,099 --> 01:10:41,669
He passed along the passage.

1185
01:10:41,758 --> 01:10:43,758
There was four passages.

1186
01:10:44,846 --> 01:10:46,268
You left out a passage.

1187
01:10:47,842 --> 01:10:49,153
Thank you.

1188
01:10:50,425 --> 01:10:51,563
Swines.

1189
01:10:53,885 --> 01:10:55,885
Did he take the wrong passage?

1190
01:10:57,754 --> 01:11:00,809
He took the right passage to room 178.

1191
01:11:03,244 --> 01:11:05,716
Wait a minute.
And then he opened the door.

1192
01:11:05,830 --> 01:11:07,830
And there lying on the bed,

1193
01:11:08,003 --> 01:11:09,526
in her own environment,

1194
01:11:10,026 --> 01:11:11,557
The grief of it.

1195
01:11:12,057 --> 01:11:13,339
The pain of it.

1196
01:11:13,562 --> 01:11:15,562
There lay Garbo.

1197
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,007
Garbo.

1198
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:29,111
Garbo.

1199
01:11:33,104 --> 01:11:36,020
Who are you? Why are you here?

1200
01:11:38,284 --> 01:11:40,544
To breathe the air you breathe.

1201
01:11:42,236 --> 01:11:44,236
I'm nuts about it.

1202
01:11:46,449 --> 01:11:49,006
Oh, that face.

1203
01:11:49,179 --> 01:11:51,717
Why does it look at me like that?

1204
01:11:54,089 --> 01:11:56,517
- Because I'm a cad.
- A cad?

1205
01:11:57,017 --> 01:11:58,645
How tired you are.

1206
01:11:58,650 --> 01:11:59,537
Yes.

1207
01:12:00,205 --> 01:12:02,205
I am tired.

1208
01:12:02,588 --> 01:12:04,159
So tired.

1209
01:12:06,369 --> 01:12:07,636
I want...

1210
01:12:10,770 --> 01:12:12,987
Miss Vronsky!

1211
01:12:15,989 --> 01:12:18,173
You're telling me!

1212
01:12:18,806 --> 01:12:19,716
Go.

1213
01:12:20,216 --> 01:12:22,216
I want to be alone.

1214
01:12:23,833 --> 01:12:25,833
What a mama.

1215
01:12:26,660 --> 01:12:27,979
Please.

1216
01:12:28,479 --> 01:12:32,683
Please, let me stay.

1217
01:12:33,183 --> 01:12:36,040
Well, just for the week then.

1218
01:12:37,757 --> 01:12:40,336
- Just for the week?
- Yes.

1219
01:13:06,245 --> 01:13:08,790
This is Miss McClune. Yes?

1220
01:13:08,828 --> 01:13:10,828
What is it?

1221
01:13:10,833 --> 01:13:12,833
What?

1222
01:13:14,035 --> 01:13:15,243
Who?

1223
01:13:17,300 --> 01:13:19,590
Yes but...where?

1224
01:13:20,518 --> 01:13:22,518
22...Remember that.

1225
01:13:22,657 --> 01:13:23,958
Get my hat and coat.

1226
01:13:23,988 --> 01:13:25,312
22 Water Street

1227
01:13:25,812 --> 01:13:27,812
I'll be right there.

1228
01:13:28,665 --> 01:13:30,665
What 's the matter, Blondie?
Who was that?

1229
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:37,500
My coat! Get me my coat! Quickly!

1230
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,647
- Get the coat, will you? 
- My coat! Hurry up!

1231
01:14:12,973 --> 01:14:15,746
Hey, girls, who are you looking for?

1232
01:14:15,793 --> 01:14:17,793
- Is this Water?
- Yes.

1233
01:14:17,848 --> 01:14:18,827
How do I get in?

1234
01:14:18,844 --> 01:14:20,741
Around the other side. You can go 
this way if you like.

1235
01:14:20,794 --> 01:14:22,786
- Oh, yes.
- Give me a hand, Mike.

1236
01:14:25,099 --> 01:14:26,561
Which way do we go?

1237
01:14:26,599 --> 01:14:29,028
Right up that way.

1238
01:14:35,395 --> 01:14:36,278
Here.

1239
01:14:36,317 --> 01:14:38,796
- What are you doing?
- He hates them.

1240
01:14:38,817 --> 01:14:42,824
- I'm Miss McClune. What's the matter?
- We got the doctor as quickly as we could.

1241
01:14:42,830 --> 01:14:46,148
- Where is he?
- He fell from his chair and struck his head

1242
01:14:50,927 --> 01:14:51,923
Pa!

1243
01:14:56,319 --> 01:14:58,649
- What's the matter? Are you the doctor?
- Yes

1244
01:14:59,149 --> 01:15:01,444
He hasn't seemed right for a long time.

1245
01:15:01,549 --> 01:15:04,544
- Are you a daughter too?
- No. Can't you get him to a hospital?

1246
01:15:04,574 --> 01:15:06,574
It isn't his head.
That's merely a scalp wound.

1247
01:15:06,621 --> 01:15:09,209
Pa, it's Blondie.

1248
01:15:11,212 --> 01:15:14,322
Why can't you do something? 
What are you standing around for?

1249
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:17,891
Blondie! The doctor says it isn't his head.

1250
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:19,430
It's his heart.

1251
01:15:20,879 --> 01:15:22,126
Oh, no.

1252
01:15:25,708 --> 01:15:27,753
Please. He's...

1253
01:15:56,493 --> 01:15:58,166
- Say, will you do me a favor?
- Sure.

1254
01:15:58,175 --> 01:15:59,328
When Blondie McClune gets off,

1255
01:15:59,334 --> 01:16:01,636
tell her that Larry Belmont's over at the
speakeasy and wants to see her right away.

1256
01:16:01,673 --> 01:16:02,958
Going to a speakeasy?

1257
01:16:02,988 --> 01:16:04,988
- Sure, he's off for Europe.
- Say, what was that?

1258
01:16:05,009 --> 01:16:08,635
When Blondie gets off, Larry Belmont
wants to see her at the speakeasy.

1259
01:16:08,656 --> 01:16:10,025
You mean he asked for Blondie McClune?

1260
01:16:10,055 --> 01:16:12,055
Sure, you heard me.

1261
01:16:26,448 --> 01:16:29,775
Going to a speakeasy? You'll be fired.

1262
01:16:29,847 --> 01:16:31,847
That would be just too bad, wouldn't it?

1263
01:16:59,300 --> 01:17:01,300
- Where's Blondie McClune?
- Here.

1264
01:17:01,310 --> 01:17:02,371
Blondie! You're wanted.

1265
01:17:02,384 --> 01:17:03,865
- Who wants me?
- A messenger.

1266
01:17:05,624 --> 01:17:07,269
Larry Belmont's screaming for you.

1267
01:17:07,274 --> 01:17:09,274
- Larry Belmont?
- Yes, didn't you get the message?

1268
01:17:09,295 --> 01:17:10,435
I didn't get any message.

1269
01:17:10,440 --> 01:17:12,744
Larry Belmont's over at the speakeasy.
He wants you to come right away.

1270
01:17:12,765 --> 01:17:13,827
Try to slip over if you can.
- I can't.

1271
01:17:14,629 --> 01:17:17,863
I think he's going to Europe tonight. 
I told the girls to tell you.

1272
01:17:17,860 --> 01:17:19,860
- They didn't tell me.
- He just asked for you again.

1273
01:17:22,216 --> 01:17:23,726
Get my things. I'm in a hurry.

1274
01:17:27,517 --> 01:17:29,027
And when is the boat sailing?

1275
01:17:29,082 --> 01:17:31,082
I don't know.
An hour and a half, two hours.

1276
01:17:31,221 --> 01:17:34,880
- And then you'll be in Paris. 
- Oui, oui, vive la France.

1277
01:17:37,119 --> 01:17:40,051
I wish I were going. 
I'd love to go to Paris.

1278
01:17:40,607 --> 01:17:42,607
Why don't you? You've got
plenty of money, haven't you?

1279
01:17:42,628 --> 01:17:44,358
Money? Yes, I have the money but...

1280
01:17:44,858 --> 01:17:46,858
- But what?
- Larry.

1281
01:17:46,896 --> 01:17:49,565
When are you coming back?
- I don't know. When the market gets better.

1282
01:17:49,586 --> 01:17:53,231
Who knows? Drink up. 
- Sure. Champagne, please.

1283
01:17:53,958 --> 01:17:55,958
You shouldn't be here
while the show is on.

1284
01:17:56,072 --> 01:17:59,237
I can't serve you. 
- No? Try and throw me out.

1285
01:17:59,839 --> 01:18:01,477
Same old Lurlene.

1286
01:18:02,313 --> 01:18:06,161
Even though things aren't, Larry..
I hate to think of your going.

1287
01:18:06,200 --> 01:18:09,456
The boat might sink. 
- By golly, I never thought of that.

1288
01:18:09,500 --> 01:18:10,380
No, you wouldn't.

1289
01:18:15,036 --> 01:18:16,510
Pardon me.

1290
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:18,300
Surely. Hurry back.

1291
01:18:26,850 --> 01:18:28,102
Hello, funny face.

1292
01:18:29,190 --> 01:18:32,437
You're going away. Why?

1293
01:18:32,973 --> 01:18:35,899
- I'm tired of things. 
- What things?

1294
01:18:35,900 --> 01:18:37,488
Fun and the market, the market and fun.

1295
01:18:37,988 --> 01:18:40,182
Work and play and all the nonsense
that goes with it.

1296
01:18:41,899 --> 01:18:43,118
Pa died, you know.

1297
01:18:44,785 --> 01:18:46,785
Yeah, I know.

1298
01:18:47,125 --> 01:18:48,806
You could have sent me a little note.

1299
01:18:50,683 --> 01:18:51,990
I'm sorry.

1300
01:18:56,375 --> 01:18:57,998
- My little girl.
- Don't say that.

1301
01:18:58,187 --> 01:18:59,656
That's what he used to call me.

1302
01:19:00,156 --> 01:19:02,156
My little girl. Just like that.

1303
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,464
You are a little girl. You always have
been and always will be.

1304
01:19:06,333 --> 01:19:09,057
Larry. Take care of yourself.

1305
01:19:09,330 --> 01:19:12,852
Don't drink. Don't get not to caring.

1306
01:19:14,272 --> 01:19:15,770
I love you. Don't you know that?

1307
01:19:17,151 --> 01:19:18,270
No.

1308
01:19:18,997 --> 01:19:21,225
I'm not drunk. I've never said that
to you before, have I?

1309
01:19:21,280 --> 01:19:24,864
- Then why are you saying it now? 
- Because I'm going away.

1310
01:19:25,618 --> 01:19:27,920
Away from you and away from myself.

1311
01:19:28,546 --> 01:19:29,325
Yes.

1312
01:19:30,815 --> 01:19:32,614
I think that would be better
for both of us.

1313
01:19:33,248 --> 01:19:34,635
We're not good for each other.

1314
01:19:34,892 --> 01:19:36,892
Come on, come on.

1315
01:19:37,590 --> 01:19:39,392
Come on, we're late.

1316
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,510
- Oh Lurlene, you're wrong!
- What do you mean, I'm wrong?

1317
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:51,683
Didn't I see you? You can't kid me. I know
more about kidding than you'll ever know.
You hear me? You little viper!

1318
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:56,771
I could have taken him away from you a million times 
if I wanted to.  I was only saying goodbye to him.

1319
01:19:56,780 --> 01:19:59,399
- You were not! 
- You're crazy! Oh, shut up!

1320
01:20:12,174 --> 01:20:15,265
We had a girl almost killed
on the end of that whip.

1321
01:20:16,143 --> 01:20:17,639
Her partner was careless.

1322
01:20:18,720 --> 01:20:20,433
I wouldn't go on if I were you.

1323
01:20:40,500 --> 01:20:43,370
Will you stop your talking? 
Stop your talking!

1324
01:21:04,676 --> 01:21:07,065
Somebody stop her. She'll kill her!

1325
01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:23,657
Keep it up, keep it up.

1326
01:21:38,300 --> 01:21:40,573
Act as if nothing's happened, now. 
Come on, nothing's happened.

1327
01:21:57,990 --> 01:22:00,145
Let's have a light there, don't crowd.

1328
01:22:02,300 --> 01:22:04,340
Step aside, please. Step aside.

1329
01:22:06,300 --> 01:22:07,540
What happened?

1330
01:22:08,540 --> 01:22:09,703
I think she was over at the speakeasy.

1331
01:22:09,750 --> 01:22:11,614
- Did you call an ambulance?
- Yes, we did.

1332
01:22:12,900 --> 01:22:14,360
Run the show.

1333
01:22:14,370 --> 01:22:16,370
Come on, guys, get going.

1334
01:22:21,317 --> 01:22:23,162
Quiet, you, quiet.

1335
01:22:27,994 --> 01:22:31,353
Let that be a lesson to you kids
to stay out of that speakeasy.

1336
01:22:31,360 --> 01:22:32,229
All right, Lonnie.

1337
01:22:32,450 --> 01:22:35,902
Geez, Blondie was a swell kid.
That Lurlene I'd like to crown.

1338
01:22:35,962 --> 01:22:37,594
You know they've been fighting
all evening?

1339
01:22:38,300 --> 01:22:42,312
- What's the matter with those two anyway? 
- It's just one of those things.

1340
01:23:38,219 --> 01:23:40,460
Hello, darling, come on in.
What's the idea?

1341
01:23:40,465 --> 01:23:41,988
A little going away party.

1342
01:23:41,993 --> 01:23:43,411
Who's going away? Blondie? Where?

1343
01:23:43,441 --> 01:23:44,570
Home, sweet home.

1344
01:23:45,977 --> 01:23:46,990
Hello.

1345
01:23:46,995 --> 01:23:48,995
- Hello, darling.
- Hello, everybody.

1346
01:23:49,243 --> 01:23:53,091
Come on in. 
- Blondie, you look great.

1347
01:23:53,860 --> 01:23:54,772
Come on, have a drink.

1348
01:23:54,949 --> 01:23:57,323
What's the matter with you all?

1349
01:23:57,412 --> 01:24:00,463
You're all dead.
This is a party it isn't a funeral.

1350
01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:04,600
Oh, what service.

1351
01:24:04,630 --> 01:24:07,660
Give me some champagne.
We're gonna have a pip of a party.

1352
01:24:08,350 --> 01:24:10,302
This is going to be fun. How are you?

1353
01:24:11,507 --> 01:24:13,507
This is grand.

1354
01:24:14,838 --> 01:24:18,630
I'm going on a pip. We're going to have
a swell time. How am I doing, kiddies?

1355
01:24:18,715 --> 01:24:20,278
I love your hat, Blondie.

1356
01:24:20,308 --> 01:24:22,308
- Thanks.
- It's darling.

1357
01:24:22,338 --> 01:24:23,870
How am I doing?

1358
01:24:28,617 --> 01:24:31,793
- Drink up, come on.
- OK.

1359
01:24:32,990 --> 01:24:34,293
I beg your pardon.

1360
01:24:36,930 --> 01:24:38,750
Ma, shall I punch that maid in the nose?

1361
01:24:38,780 --> 01:24:39,775
Better not.

1362
01:24:39,813 --> 01:24:42,949
Did you see the way she looked at me?
Anybody would think that I was rat poison.

1363
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:46,300
Ma...

1364
01:24:48,990 --> 01:24:50,900
Ma, I wonder if this is hers.

1365
01:24:52,610 --> 01:24:54,112
You know, a lot of things
here were presents.

1366
01:24:54,310 --> 01:24:57,208
Everything's packed.
Everything she's taking home.

1367
01:24:57,406 --> 01:24:59,406
I never knew she rented this place furnished.

1368
01:24:59,453 --> 01:25:01,453
She could have sold a lot of these things.

1369
01:25:01,470 --> 01:25:03,458
- Pardon me!
- Certainly.

1370
01:25:04,712 --> 01:25:07,198
She never told me her business.

1371
01:25:07,219 --> 01:25:09,219
- Hello.
- Hello, darling.

1372
01:25:09,890 --> 01:25:13,129
- Where have you been? You're late. 
- Why don't you come up and stay with me?

1373
01:25:13,150 --> 01:25:17,258
No, I'm going home. The day and the month 
for this palace of luck is up today.

1374
01:25:17,300 --> 01:25:20,678
I'm celebrating. Come on, have a drink. 
- But Mr. Murchenson said you don't have to go.

1375
01:25:20,700 --> 01:25:24,307
That's very kind of Mr. Murchenson but
little Blondie has to go. Simply must.

1376
01:25:24,330 --> 01:25:25,530
You can't go back to that dump.

1377
01:25:25,612 --> 01:25:28,253
Are you referring to the McClune Manor?

1378
01:25:28,392 --> 01:25:32,565
- The place for little lame ducks is at home. 
- But you're going to get better, kid!

1379
01:25:32,600 --> 01:25:33,980
Come on, drink up. Who cares?

1380
01:25:34,024 --> 01:25:36,352
- I care, Blondie.
- I know you do.

1381
01:25:36,491 --> 01:25:39,306
Don't spoil the party now.
Everything's going great.

1382
01:25:39,319 --> 01:25:41,571
- Hi, kiddies.
- You're a wonder.

1383
01:25:41,990 --> 01:25:44,952
- Don't make me laugh. - You make me feel like a...

1384
01:25:44,990 --> 01:25:47,705
Now listen, don't start that all over again. 
It was an accident.

1385
01:25:47,720 --> 01:25:49,749
- It wasn't an accident.
- It was.

1386
01:25:49,750 --> 01:25:50,365
- It wasn't.
- Was too.

1387
01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:51,580
It wasn't. I hated you.

1388
01:25:51,885 --> 01:25:53,820
That was an accident, wasn't it?

1389
01:25:54,340 --> 01:25:58,508
Isn't everything an accident? 
Blondie McClune arrives.

1390
01:25:58,885 --> 01:26:00,480
The toast of the town.

1391
01:26:00,980 --> 01:26:03,467
She suddenly retires to the 
seclusion of her home.

1392
01:26:04,420 --> 01:26:06,420
Everything's an accident.
Don't kid yourself.

1393
01:26:06,626 --> 01:26:09,900
You never know what's around the corner.

1394
01:26:10,012 --> 01:26:12,897
Look what's coming around the corner now, 
get a load of that!

1395
01:26:12,990 --> 01:26:16,567
Hello, Lottie. My, this is cute. 
Can I take it home for the baby?

1396
01:26:16,570 --> 01:26:18,986
- No, dear, it belongs to the apartment. 
- Well, it's cute anyway.

1397
01:26:19,384 --> 01:26:21,764
I wouldn't let Ma have
any more to drink.

1398
01:26:21,811 --> 01:26:24,601
It's popping right out of her nose.
She'll be having sinus for a month.

1399
01:26:24,940 --> 01:26:26,100
What time is it?

1400
01:26:26,113 --> 01:26:27,844
I think I better be running along. 
Where are my pegs?

1401
01:26:27,900 --> 01:26:31,874
- Ah, Madame!
- Ah, Monsieur! How kind of you. Do you mind?

1402
01:26:31,900 --> 01:26:33,641
Thank you so much.

1403
01:26:34,300 --> 01:26:36,371
All right kiddies, here's lots of the joy water.

1404
01:26:36,418 --> 01:26:38,418
Everybody have a drink.

1405
01:26:46,900 --> 01:26:49,267
Hello, Larry. I'm glad you came.

1406
01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:54,020
- Will you sit down? I'd like to talk to you.
- No, mister, no.

1407
01:26:54,850 --> 01:26:59,444
- What is this, a goodbye party?
- Yes. It's the windup. The finish.

1408
01:26:59,500 --> 01:27:02,071
- Where do you think you're going?  
- I know where I'm going.

1409
01:27:02,100 --> 01:27:03,488
I'm going home.
- Uptown?

1410
01:27:03,500 --> 01:27:05,484
Uptown eastside, yes.

1411
01:27:06,227 --> 01:27:08,993
- What about Murchenson?
- Finished.

1412
01:27:09,392 --> 01:27:13,541
- What about me? Am I finished? 
- There was nothing to finish with us.

1413
01:27:13,550 --> 01:27:15,511
- No?
- No. Come on.

1414
01:27:19,482 --> 01:27:22,550
- What do your doctors say? 
- What do doctors say?

1415
01:27:22,570 --> 01:27:24,205
They look you over. They smile.

1416
01:27:24,252 --> 01:27:26,461
They hurt you. They shake their heads.

1417
01:27:26,751 --> 01:27:29,600
They're noncommittal. I think that's
what the word is, isn't it?

1418
01:27:29,909 --> 01:27:31,993
What do you think you're going to gain
by going back there?

1419
01:27:32,090 --> 01:27:36,773
Just the place for me. Not so bad really. It's fine.

1420
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:39,734
- Do you know the place for you? 
- Home.

1421
01:27:39,750 --> 01:27:43,780
- With me always. 
- No. Now don't be serious.

1422
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:47,116
It's very nice of you to say that but...No.

1423
01:27:47,414 --> 01:27:49,414
- Is it because of these?
- Perhaps.

1424
01:27:49,960 --> 01:27:54,248
- But if you were well? 
- Well? That's another story.

1425
01:27:54,742 --> 01:27:58,586
But the way I am, I'm no good to anybody, am I?

1426
01:27:58,600 --> 01:28:00,513
- You think that makes any difference?
- Of course it does.

1427
01:28:00,543 --> 01:28:03,701
Come in and have a drink.
I'm giving up the apartment at 6.

1428
01:28:03,764 --> 01:28:05,555
For the new tenants. Come in.

1429
01:28:05,990 --> 01:28:07,828
- I've got to be going.
- Goodbye, mister.

1430
01:28:07,917 --> 01:28:10,658
Hey, kiddies, come on.
We've got to get out of here at 6.

1431
01:28:10,700 --> 01:28:12,267
It's six o'clock now. I'll get you a car.

1432
01:28:12,297 --> 01:28:14,558
Drink it all up tout suite.
Come on, have some champagne.

1433
01:28:14,596 --> 01:28:16,134
Come on.

1434
01:28:16,139 --> 01:28:17,878
Bye, darling, I'm going.

1435
01:28:17,891 --> 01:28:19,270
- Must you?
- Yes.

1436
01:28:19,571 --> 01:28:21,571
- You let Larry go.
- Of course.

1437
01:28:23,381 --> 01:28:25,381
- I'll come up and see you.
- Mind you do.

1438
01:28:25,881 --> 01:28:27,881
- So long, kid.
- So long, Mug.

1439
01:28:31,312 --> 01:28:32,920
She's a peach, isn't she?

1440
01:28:33,300 --> 01:28:37,208
Blondie, why don't you come over to my place. 
I'll give you a party after the show.

1441
01:28:37,250 --> 01:28:39,560
No. It's after the show for me now.

1442
01:28:42,300 --> 01:28:43,446
This is the last party

1443
01:28:44,200 --> 01:28:49,679
Positively the last public appearance
of that celebrated dancer, Blondie McClune.

1444
01:28:49,700 --> 01:28:51,106
Hurray! Come on, Ma.

1445
01:28:52,350 --> 01:28:56,143
Seriously kids: I'm not trying to be theatrical.

1446
01:28:56,200 --> 01:29:01,065
I just wanted to see you all, 
wish you good luck and you know...

1447
01:29:01,200 --> 01:29:04,694
I'm happy, really I am. 
This could have happened to anybody.

1448
01:29:04,700 --> 01:29:08,531
When anything like this happens, 
all you have to do is keep on laughing.

1449
01:29:08,550 --> 01:29:14,287
Hi kiddies! How am I doing? 
Home, James, and don't spare the horses.

1450
01:29:21,300 --> 01:29:22,833
My, who are you? The police?

1451
01:29:23,079 --> 01:29:25,758
- Can we come in, please?
- No, we're all asleep.

1452
01:29:32,190 --> 01:29:33,499
What's the row?

1453
01:29:33,999 --> 01:29:36,927
You might as well come in.
You'll wake up the whole house.

1454
01:29:37,250 --> 01:29:38,550
- Come in, gentlemen.
- Thanks.

1455
01:29:40,397 --> 01:29:43,608
What do they want? What do they want?

1456
01:29:43,617 --> 01:29:45,026
Oh, what do they want?

1457
01:29:45,207 --> 01:29:47,630
Do you know what time it is?
It's a quarter past three.

1458
01:29:52,500 --> 01:29:56,537
- Say, the joint's full of men,
I think they're after you. - Who are they?

1459
01:29:56,600 --> 01:29:59,415
- Search me, I don't know. A lot of old geezers 
with black bags. - You're kidding aren't you?

1460
01:29:59,420 --> 01:30:00,927
This is the funniest thing last.

1461
01:30:01,041 --> 01:30:03,240
- What do they want?
- You better go and see.

1462
01:30:04,272 --> 01:30:06,821
- Sorry to disturb you.
- It's Larry Belmont.

1463
01:30:08,068 --> 01:30:10,560
It's important. If you don't come out,
we'll have to come in and get you.

1464
01:30:11,600 --> 01:30:12,659
Get me my things.

1465
01:30:13,900 --> 01:30:19,602
- Oh, I see. You mean they could
break the leg again and reset it? - Yes.

1466
01:30:19,848 --> 01:30:22,178
- And that would do the trick?
- Undoubtedly.

1467
01:30:26,300 --> 01:30:29,654
- Blondie, come in and sit down. 
- Yes, you better sit down.

1468
01:30:30,097 --> 01:30:31,665
- But why? 
- These men are specialists.

1469
01:30:31,730 --> 01:30:34,165
I've dragged them from their homes,
their clubs and their hospitals.

1470
01:30:34,825 --> 01:30:38,412
They know the history of your case 
and they've seen the x-rays.

1471
01:30:38,430 --> 01:30:40,825
And they're convinced that
you could be completely cured.

1472
01:30:49,142 --> 01:30:51,142
- No, mister.
- It's true.

1473
01:30:51,382 --> 01:30:52,990
- Isn't it so, doctor?
- Yes.

1474
01:30:53,309 --> 01:30:55,550
Yes, if your wife would come down
to the hospital we could...

1475
01:30:55,970 --> 01:31:00,518
- I'm not his wife. 
- But you will be.

1476
01:31:00,990 --> 01:31:01,654
Won't you?

1477
01:31:03,755 --> 01:31:05,380
OK, mister.

1478
01:31:06,850 --> 01:31:07,990
Mister yourself.

1479
