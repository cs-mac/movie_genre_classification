Hi, it's Fred!

4
00:00:22,822 --> 00:00:23,622
Today is Friday.

5
00:00:23,622 --> 00:00:26,756
Oh my god, that sounds like Freday.

6
00:00:26,756 --> 00:00:29,253
Friday, Freday. Friday, Freday.

7
00:00:29,303 --> 00:00:32,657
Two days no school, pure happiness.

8
00:00:32,657 --> 00:00:36,700
Oh my gosh, today is like this weekend to make the weekends the week and the week with the weekends.

9
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:40,846
That means we're gonna have five whole days off and only two days at school.

10
00:00:40,846 --> 00:00:43,279
Oh, my gammit! I'm so excited!

11
00:00:43,279 --> 00:00:45,592
And then there's really important holiday like Precident's Day,

12
00:00:45,592 --> 00:00:47,477
We only have one day at school.

13
00:00:47,477 --> 00:00:50,060
I think they might decide to do that this weekend.

created by walterclozet from livedash for CFT team.

15
00:01:06,187 --> 00:01:07,368
Hey, hi.

16
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:09,189
Hi, hi.

17
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:12,842
See you guys tomorrow, see you.

18
00:01:13,812 --> 00:01:16,176
Yeah, hey.

19
00:01:18,267 --> 00:01:19,756
You never said it before.

20
00:01:20,699 --> 00:01:21,736
Judy...

21
00:02:53,322 --> 00:02:54,127
Judy...

22
00:03:04,991 --> 00:03:05,872
Judy...

23
00:03:20,771 --> 00:03:22,721
You might not be able to tell, but...

24
00:03:27,119 --> 00:03:28,476
That's Judy...

25
00:03:31,498 --> 00:03:33,502
She's my girlfriend... obviously.

26
00:03:33,502 --> 00:03:37,233
This weekend it's crucial on our realationship, because...

27
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,400
Wait for it.

28
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,400
Get ready.

29
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,400
It's coming, hold on.

30
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,400
I'm taking things to the next level with judy.

31
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,400
And she knows it too.

32
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,400
We've been inseparable lately.

33
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,400
- So I was thinking of having a party this weekend.

34
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,400
- Yeah, we've been thinking about it.

35
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,400
- But i--maybe i-- - yeah, we aren't really sure yet.

36
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,400
Ow!

37
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,400
- What do you guys think?

38
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,400
[Playing chaotic piano riff] - I'm thinking I might have judy over today.

39
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,400
I'm not really sure.

40
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,400
I mean, my mom won't mind.

41
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,400
I have friends over all the time, and she never cares.

42
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:11,400
My dad doesn't care either, ..

43
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,400
He's not here.

44
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,400
He's not with us.

45
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,400
He's not dead.

46
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:15,400
He's just not here.

47
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,400
Can see how you might have misunderstood that.

48
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:26,400
But, you know, it really doesn't even matter that I just have one parent, because my mom loves me twice as much, and I pay her back by filling the whole entire house with beautiful music.

49
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,400
?? Somebody call 911 ??

50
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,400
?? shorty fire burning on that dance floor ??

51
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,400
?? whoa ??

52
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,400
every room in my house was constructed for a specific purpose.

53
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:42,400
For instance, this room, my bedroom, was constructed to have a perfect view of judy's house.

54
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,400
[sighs] Hi, judy.

55
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:53,400
Fridays are usually my favorite day at school, but I need some food for my body because today was the worst friday ever!

56
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:59,400
[laughter] - Whoa!

57
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,400
- He likes it!

58
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:00,400
He likes it, mommy!

59
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,400
- Oh! - he likes it.

60
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,400
- Thank you!

61
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,400
- Oh!

62
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,400
You want some more?

63
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:12,400
- Kevin, just leave him alone.

64
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,400
- No.

65
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:31,400
[glass clattering] - If I don't get any food in my body, then there's gonna be no blood in my head, and then my head might fall off 'cause there's no blood in it.

66
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,400
Oh, my gammit!

67
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:38,400
I'm so upset about what happened at school that I almost ruined my snack.

68
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:49,400
Cheese.

69
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:55,400
I say "oh, my gammit" because I'm not allowed to say bad words ...

70
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,400
The "d" word.

71
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:01,400
Anyhow, the thing that happened happened in music class.

72
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:05,400
I love music class, because, well, I'm a great singer.

73
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,400
?? 911 ??

74
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,400
?? shorty fire burning on that dance floor ??

75
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:12,400
you know who else is a great singer?

76
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,400
- ?? Freddy ??

77
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,400
- judy.

78
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,400
She sings like an angel.

79
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,400
But like an angel who isn't dead, because she'll never die.

80
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,400
..

81
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:29,400
Until she dies.

82
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:34,400
Yum.

83
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,400
Blah!

84
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:40,400
Hot thing! hot thing! hot thing! hot thing!

85
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,400
I burned my tongue!

86
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:56,400
[screaming] Hot thing! hot thing! hot thing!

87
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,400
I'm drowning.

88
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,400
I've decided not to have a snack after all, because I want to stay trim for judy.

89
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:10,400
To be honest, me and judy have hit a minor bump in our relationship thanks to kevin.

90
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:15,400
Kevin is a big, fat nothing, and I could not believe what I saw her doing with him today.

91
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,400
[together] ?? YOU JUST GOT TO BE STRONG ??

92
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,400
?? Just stop ??

93
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,400
- ?? 'cause I really love you ??

94
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,400
- ?? stop ??

95
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,400
?? I'll be thinking of you ??

96
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,400
[together] ?? LOOK IN MY HEART ??

97
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,400
?? And let love ??

98
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,400
?? keep us together ??

99
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,400
- oh, my god, they sounded terrible.

100
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:37,400
It was like my mom trying to fit into her jeans.

101
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,400
Hmm.

102
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,400
Eeny, meeny, miney, moe.

103
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,400
There we go.

104
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,400
It was horrible.

105
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,400
I mean, and she didn't even notice it.

106
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,400
You agree, right?

107
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,400
I mean, judy was up there, and she seemed happy.

108
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,400
I don't know if she was acting or what, but I have to tell her.

109
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:56,400
Maybe I'll invite her over for a pool party, and as we're lounging by the pool, I'll break it to her gently.

110
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:01,400
Judy, lover, you are a wonderful singer.

111
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,400
- Oh, thank you, fred.

112
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,400
..

113
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,400
That was a mistake.

114
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:09,400
- I need someone like you to be honest with me.

115
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,400
- Don't worry, darling.

116
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:16,400
I've just had a law passed that will have kevin arrested for the way he sang to you.

117
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,400
- That's such a relief.

118
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:25,400
[sirens blaring] - Stop!

119
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,400
Stop!

120
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,400
?? 'Cause I really love you ??

121
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,400
?? stop ??

122
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,400
?? I'll be thinking of you ??

123
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:38,400
- anyone ever sings to you like that again, just tell me, and I'll take care of it, darling.

124
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:43,400
- You're so romantic, fred.

125
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:49,400
- Judy!

126
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:52,400
- Just beyond that wall over there is judy's house.

127
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:57,400
She's only a few feet away, and I can't reach her.

128
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:01,400
They put up that wall to keep us apart.

129
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:04,400
- What you doing, fred?

130
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:10,400
- What does it look like I'm doing, bertha?

131
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:16,400
- Judy would think it's silly that you have a kiddie pool.

132
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,400
I don't care what judy thinks.

133
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,400
Why would I care what judy thinks.

134
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,400
What makes you think that?

135
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:24,400
I mean, it's just judy.

136
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,400
- Okay. you're not going swimming?

137
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,400
- No, I'm not going swimming.

138
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:31,400
I'm not--that's lame, really, really lame.

139
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:34,400
- Well, I think I might go swimming.

140
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:38,400
- Have fun. - ttfn.

141
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:44,400
- [screams] Oh, my god, that was almost so embarrassing.

142
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:47,400
Thank god I didn't invite judy over for the pool party.

143
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:51,400
Sometimes I don't think I know anything about women.

144
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,400
I need some advice.

145
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,400
I wish my dad was here.

146
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,400
Dad?

147
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,400
What do you think I should do?

148
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:03,400
- The secret is ruthless aggression.

149
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,400
- It is?

150
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:10,400
- You got to look at yourself and say, " show her what kind of man you really are.

151
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,400
Use those talents.

152
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,400
What are your talents, fred?

153
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,400
- I-i'm a good singer.

154
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,400
- No!

155
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,400
- Ow!

156
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,400
- You're a great singer.

157
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,400
You're the best!

158
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:26,400
It is you who take mere words and make them melodious love.

159
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,400
Are you with me?

160
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,400
- Yep.

161
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,400
- You got to fire up!

162
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,400
- I'm with you, dad.

163
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:34,400
- Well, good, just-- just remember, it's probably gonna get cold outside.

164
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,400
Bring a sweater, okay?

165
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,400
- Okay, dad. thanks.

166
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:37,400
That's it.

167
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:41,400
I've got to invite judy over so we can harmonize together.

168
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:49,400
And then she'll forget all about kevin, 'cause harmonizing with me will be so much smoother.

169
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:52,400
- ?? And soon both of us ??

170
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:55,400
?? learned to trust ??

171
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,400
?? not run away ??

172
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:00,400
- [smooth falsetto] ?? IT WAS NO TIME TO Play ??

173
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,400
- ?? we build it up ??

174
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,400
?? and build it up ??

175
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,400
- yow.

176
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:08,400
- ?? And now it's solid ??

177
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:12,400
both: ?? SOLID AS A ROCK ??

178
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:16,400
?? And nothing's changed it ??

179
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:21,400
- ?? the thrill is still ha ha ha ha ha ha ha hot ??

180
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,400
this is it!

181
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:25,400
I'm gonna go over to judy's house and invite her over to sing with me.

182
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:36,400
[singing in an operatic soprano] ?? ??

183
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:39,400
I'm so excited!

184
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,400
I smell beautiful.

185
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,400
Nothing is gonna come between our love, judy.

186
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,400
Nothing!

187
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:49,400
[aggressive hip-hop beat] Oh, my gammit, kevin!

188
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,400
I'm not going out there.

189
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:58,400
If I go out there and ask judy to come over in front of kevin, he's gonna undermine my self-confidence.

190
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:01,400
Maybe he won't notice.

191
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,400
I've got to try.

192
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:05,400
Here I come to harmonize with you, judy.

193
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:08,400
?? La ??

194
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,400
I'm gonna do it.

195
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:15,400
I can do it.

196
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,400
- Hey, figglehorn, where you going, huh?

197
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,400
- None of your business, kevin.

198
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,400
- Oh, okay.

199
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,400
What, are you going to judy's house for a little play date, huh?

200
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:29,400
You guys gonna do-- ehhh-ahhh-ehllll ahhll!

201
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:29,400
Huh?

202
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,400
You gonna do a little bit of that, huh?

203
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:34,400
- Kevin, that's not what I was gonna do, okay?

204
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,400
- Dude, she hates you, man.

205
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:38,400
Why can't you just get that through your head, dude.

206
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,400
She hates you. she tells me all the time.

207
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:44,400
I mean, like, she came over yesterday and like-- you know?

208
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,400
- She hates you, kevin.

209
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:49,400
I can see how you misunderstood it, because she hates you.

210
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,400
- She doesn't hate me.

211
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,400
We're on a-- we're on a first-name basis.

212
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,400
- Yeah, yeah?

213
00:12:53,400 --> 00:13:05,400
She hates everybody who can't sing, kevin.

214
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,400
- I can sing.

215
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,400
This whole neighborhood knows.

216
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,400
[laughs] YOU KNOW?

217
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,400
You know?

218
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,400
The whole neighborhood knows I can sing.

219
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,400
I can sing, dude.

220
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,400
I mean, she hears me all the time, man.

221
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,400
I'm perfect; I got perfect pitch.

222
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:23,400
I've been told since day one I have perfect pitch.

223
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:26,400
I mean, I can reach-- I can reach all the notes.

224
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,400
- That--that's weird.

225
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:33,400
..

226
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,400
She thinks you suck at singing.

227
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,400
- Oh, you're gonna get it.

228
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,400
You're gonna get it, figglehorn.

229
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,400
You want some of this? - she said it; I didn't.

230
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,400
- Huh, you want it?

231
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:45,400
- [screaming] - This is my cul de sac.

232
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,400
It always has been.

233
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,400
It always will be, baby.

234
00:13:49,400 --> 00:16:46,400
Whoo!

235
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:07,400
E)D0Lr cig+et¨¢"h@ WhAND U CAN'T GO B",K bg-DOP8?

236
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,400
I was so close.

237
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:09,400
[door unlatching] [gasps] Oh, my gosh, kevin's trying to get inside the house.

238
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,400
- Fred. - go home, kevin!

239
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,400
- Figglehorn.

240
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,400
- Get away from my house.

241
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,400
I will call the police.

242
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,400
- Fred!

243
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,400
- I'm calling the police right now.

244
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,400
- Figglehorn.

245
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:27,400
- Already called the police, and they said that if you don't stop, you're gonna go to prison with the fattest people ever!

246
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,400
- Fred, open the door!

247
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,400
- Oh.

248
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,400
Mom, sorry.

249
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,400
You're strong.

250
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,400
- Fred, what's going on in here?

251
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:39,400
- Mom, I thought someone was going to attack me.

252
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,400
Although I don't know why anyone would want to.

253
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:49,400
- Maybe because of your voice.

254
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,400
- Mom.

255
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,400
Mom.

256
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,400
Mom! mom! - what, sweetie?

257
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:55,400
- I'm gonna have a friend over so we can sing, okay?

258
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,400
- Honey, no singing.

259
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:00,400
I'm taking a nap.

260
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,400
- Mom.

261
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,400
We'll be quiet.

262
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,400
- Can't hear you.

263
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:09,400
I'm taking a nap!

264
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:12,400
- Kevin!

265
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:17,400
I can't go over there and ask judy to my house with kevin out there.

266
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,400
He'll embarrass me.

267
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:21,400
Judy has such a beautiful southern accent.

268
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:25,400
I know it would harmonize perfectly with my normal human accent.

269
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,400
I don't know what to do.

270
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,400
- What's wrong with you?

271
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,400
Have I taught you nothing? - dad.

272
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,400
- No son of mine is gonna sit in here and ..

273
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:36,400
From kevin?

274
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,400
Yeah!

275
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:40,400
My house!

276
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,400
Sorry, son.

277
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:44,400
- I don't want kevin to make fun of me in front of judy.

278
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,400
[grunts] - Make fun of you.

279
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:49,400
Sometimes you don't use these muscles.

280
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,400
You use this muscle.

281
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,400
You got to out-think kevin.

282
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,400
You got to find another route.

283
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:55,400
- Dad, the only route is blocked by the wall.

284
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,400
- The wall is nothing.

285
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,400
It was put there to keep you and your true love apart.

286
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,400
- I knew it.

287
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,400
- I am taking a nap!

288
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,400
- [whispers] I KNEW IT.

289
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,400
- Huh?

290
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,400
- My time is now.

291
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,400
- Your time is now.

292
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,400
- My time is now.

293
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,400
- Your time is now.

294
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:12,400
- My time is now!

295
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,400
- Your time is now.

296
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,400
- Oh.

297
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,400
Sorry, dad.

298
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:19,400
- It's good.

299
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,400
You're ready.

300
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,400
- Thanks, dad.

301
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,400
- Before you go.

302
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,400
Little schmutz.

303
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:30,400
- Once I get over that wall, I can go up to judy's backdoor and ask her to come over.

304
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:34,400
I've never seen judy's backdoor, but I bet it's really nice.

305
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:37,400
I'm gonna use this to make a flying leap over the fence.

306
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:46,400
And then me and judy are gonna walk back over to my house really proudly, and then kevin's gonna be, like, all confused, so he won't even be able to do anything, and then we'll be back into my house before he even knows it.

307
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,400
Oh, and this is the trampoline.

308
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,400
I got it from my mom.

309
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,400
She uses it to train for work.

310
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,400
I bet you kevin never would've thought of this.

311
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,400
Stupid kevin!

312
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,400
Ha ha ha!

313
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:59,400
Kiss this, kevin!

314
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:14,400
Here I come, judy.

315
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,400
I'm coming, judy.

316
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:24,400
Just hold on.

317
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,400
Ow!

318
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:30,400
[screaming] - Freddie, you okay?

319
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,400
- I hurt myself while trying to get to judy's.

320
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,400
- Do you need to go to the hospital?

321
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:40,400
- No, I don't think so.

322
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,400
- Then I'm taking a nap.

323
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,400
- This is better.

324
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,400
Much less dangerous.

325
00:17:47,400 --> 00:18:05,400
[grunting] Ow.

326
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:09,400
Digging's hard.

327
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:13,400
Ow!

328
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:16,400
[screams] I'm coming for you, judy.

329
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,400
Just hold on.

330
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,400
Don't give up.

331
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,400
Ow!

332
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:25,400
?? I've been digging in the tunnel ??

333
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:29,400
?? all hacking day ??

334
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,400
[panting] Okay.

335
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,400
Going back down.

336
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:40,400
It takes forever to get to judy's house underground.

337
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,400
Huh?

338
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,400
What's this?

339
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:49,400
[electricity crackling] - Oof!

340
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,400
Ow!

341
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,400
Mom!

342
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:57,400
- [deep voice] AWESOME.

343
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:00,400
Oh, my gammit, that was awesome!

344
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,400
I'm coming, judy.

345
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,400
I have butt loads of energy.

346
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:10,400
Here I come.

347
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,400
I'm here.

348
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:16,400
Oh, my gammit, I dug all the way to china!

349
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:33,400
[screaming] - [whistling] - I figured out what I'm gonna do.

350
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,400
I'm gonna disguise myself.

351
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,400
Kevin will never recognize me.

352
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:45,400
He'll be totally fooled, and I'll walk up to judy's door and rip off my disguise, and she'll think it's a joke, and then she'll laugh, and then I'll laugh, and then we'll both be laughing.

353
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:48,400
[sniffing] Mm.

354
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,400
I'm gonna smell like green apples.

355
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,400
I have the perfect disguise.

356
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,400
I ordered it from the back of a comic book, and it is amazing.

357
00:19:55,400 --> 00:20:01,400
It's an invisibility suit, and it's gonna make me completely invisible.

358
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,400
Here it is.

359
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:09,400
I've been waiting to use this.

360
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,400
Whoa.

361
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,400
See you guys later.

362
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,400
Wow!

363
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:17,400
That was totally worth $6.98.

364
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:23,400
Plus shipping and handling.

365
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:26,400
- Huh?

366
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:32,400
What's going on here?

367
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,400
- Where am i, kevin?

368
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,400
I'm here.

369
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,400
- Whoa! - no, I'm not.

370
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,400
I'm over here.

371
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,400
Think fast.

372
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,400
- What? - watch out!

373
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,400
- What are you gonna do, kevin?

374
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,400
- What are you?

375
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,400
- Behind you.

376
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,400
Oh, it's over here.

377
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,400
Oh, does baby want the ball?

378
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,400
Watch out. - stop!

379
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,400
- What, are you gonna cry?

380
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,400
[laughs] - Stop!

381
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:58,400
- Oh, does baby kevin need his mommy?

382
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:10,400
- [crying] - [laughing maniacally] Here goes nothing.

383
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:16,400
Oh, my gosh, that's such a weird feeling.

384
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,400
Floating shoe.

385
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,400
Who's doing it?

386
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,400
I don't know.

387
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:28,400
Must be someone invisible.

388
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,400
What the heck?

389
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,400
Okay, maybe I just didn't do it right.

390
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,400
One, two, three.

391
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,400
Pew!

392
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:39,400
Pew!

393
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,400
Gammit!

394
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:46,360
[growling] I guess I have to find a better disguise.

395
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,412
Ooh!

396
00:21:57,415 --> 00:22:35,415
Boy, do I wish I could pull that one off.

397
00:22:35,415 --> 00:22:40,415
- Wait, what?

398
00:22:40,415 --> 00:22:41,415
What?

399
00:22:41,415 --> 00:22:45,415
- [furiously ringing doorbell] - Judy, I'm here!

400
00:22:45,415 --> 00:22:46,415
- Is that fred?

401
00:22:46,415 --> 00:22:55,415
- [gasps] - Fred.

402
00:22:55,415 --> 00:22:57,415
I'm gonna get you!

403
00:22:57,415 --> 00:23:04,415
- [crying] Oh, my gammit, asian people have kidnapped judy!

404
00:23:04,415 --> 00:23:04,415
What do I do?

405
00:23:04,415 --> 00:23:15,415
I got to call the police and the cops and the fbi, the cia and the fbi and the army and the cops and the swat team and--and-- I never had an emergency before.

406
00:23:15,415 --> 00:23:16,415
I don't know who to call.

407
00:23:16,415 --> 00:23:17,415
I don't even know what number to call.

408
00:23:17,415 --> 00:23:20,415
?? Somebody call 911 ??

409
00:23:20,415 --> 00:23:23,415
that's who I have to call.

410
00:23:23,415 --> 00:23:23,415
- 911.

411
00:23:23,415 --> 00:23:24,415
What's your emergency?

412
00:23:24,415 --> 00:23:30,415
- Hello, this is fred, fred figglehorn, and I'm here to tell you that my girlfriend judy has been kidnapped by asian people.

413
00:23:30,415 --> 00:23:33,415
Asian people have stolen my girlfriend and her stuff and her family. - sir?

414
00:23:33,415 --> 00:23:41,415
- Although if you ask her if she's my girlfriend and she says no, it's cause we haven't told a lot of people yet, and we were kind of keeping it on the down-low, you know?

415
00:23:41,415 --> 00:23:43,415
People will be jealous, you know?

416
00:23:43,415 --> 00:23:44,415
Anyways, she's gone!

417
00:23:44,415 --> 00:23:46,415
- Sir, you need to calm down.

418
00:23:46,415 --> 00:23:49,415
- Calm down?

419
00:23:49,415 --> 00:23:50,415
Hello?

420
00:23:50,415 --> 00:23:58,415
[busy signal] That is really frustrating that the police won't even help me.

421
00:23:58,415 --> 00:24:00,415
Her kidnappers could be anywhere by now.

422
00:24:00,415 --> 00:24:03,415
She's gonna have such a horrible life!

423
00:24:03,415 --> 00:24:06,415
- Fred, what is your problem?

424
00:24:06,415 --> 00:24:07,415
- Mom!

425
00:24:07,415 --> 00:24:08,415
Mom, wake up!

426
00:24:08,415 --> 00:24:09,415
Wake up right now!

427
00:24:09,415 --> 00:24:10,415
- I am up.

428
00:24:10,415 --> 00:24:11,415
..

429
00:24:11,415 --> 00:24:14,415
Judy's been kidnapped, and they took all her stuff.

430
00:24:14,415 --> 00:24:16,415
She might be dead.

431
00:24:16,415 --> 00:24:17,415
I don't even know.

432
00:24:17,415 --> 00:24:19,415
- What are you talking about?

433
00:24:19,415 --> 00:24:22,415
- Her house.

434
00:24:22,415 --> 00:24:23,415
It's completely empty.

435
00:24:23,415 --> 00:24:27,415
- Maybe that's because they moved.

436
00:24:27,415 --> 00:24:28,415
- What?

437
00:24:28,415 --> 00:24:32,415
- They sold their house to the tangs, and they moved.

438
00:24:32,415 --> 00:24:33,415
I got their address right here.

439
00:24:33,415 --> 00:24:36,415
They asked me to forward their mail.

440
00:24:36,415 --> 00:24:39,415
- [gasps] Judy moved!

441
00:24:39,415 --> 00:24:40,415
Where to?

442
00:24:40,415 --> 00:24:41,415
- I don't know.

443
00:24:41,415 --> 00:24:43,415
They asked me to forward the mail.

444
00:24:43,415 --> 00:24:45,415
- Why didn't you tell me?

445
00:24:45,415 --> 00:24:51,415
- Because, freddie, i-- I didn't know you'd be so upset.

446
00:24:51,415 --> 00:24:55,415
I wrote the address-- - mom! she's my girlfriend.

447
00:24:55,415 --> 00:24:56,415
Judy.

448
00:24:56,415 --> 00:24:57,415
- Freddie.

449
00:24:57,415 --> 00:25:01,415
I get any of their mail, I'm tossing it.

450
00:25:01,415 --> 00:25:02,415
All right, honey, relax.

451
00:25:02,415 --> 00:25:03,415
I'm going out.

452
00:25:03,415 --> 00:25:05,415
Be a good boy.

453
00:25:05,415 --> 00:25:09,415
You're a good boy.

454
00:25:09,415 --> 00:25:11,415
- Judy, no!

455
00:25:11,415 --> 00:26:02,415
[screaming] [loud animalistic roar] [moaning] ?? Judy moved away ??

456
00:26:02,415 --> 00:26:04,415
?? I'm so alone ??

457
00:26:04,415 --> 00:26:06,415
?? it hurts so much ??

458
00:26:06,415 --> 00:26:08,415
?? oh whoa ??

459
00:26:08,415 --> 00:26:11,415
?? whoa ??

460
00:26:11,415 --> 00:26:16,415
- freddie, please go to sleep.

461
00:26:16,415 --> 00:26:18,415
- ?? My heart is broken ??

462
00:26:18,415 --> 00:26:23,415
?? and my mom doesn't even care ??

463
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:28,415
?? whoa oh oh oh ??

464
00:26:28,415 --> 00:26:33,415
[snoring] - Fred!

465
00:26:33,415 --> 00:26:39,415
It's go time!

466
00:26:39,415 --> 00:26:43,415
- [crying] Dad, what's wrong?

467
00:26:43,415 --> 00:26:44,415
- It's judy.

468
00:26:44,415 --> 00:26:46,415
..

469
00:26:46,415 --> 00:26:47,415
By kidnappers.

470
00:26:47,415 --> 00:26:50,415
- Kidnappers?

471
00:26:50,415 --> 00:26:51,415
Who are they?

472
00:26:51,415 --> 00:26:52,415
- Her parents. - no!

473
00:26:52,415 --> 00:26:55,415
- Luckily, in the final minutes, she sent us a transmission.

474
00:26:55,415 --> 00:26:57,415
Check it out. it's right there.

475
00:26:57,415 --> 00:26:58,415
- ?? Doo doo doo-doo-doo ??

476
00:26:58,415 --> 00:26:59,415
?? dora ??

477
00:26:59,415 --> 00:27:00,415
?? doo doo doo-doo-doo ??

478
00:27:00,415 --> 00:27:01,415
?? dora ??

479
00:27:01,415 --> 00:27:03,415
- that's classified.

480
00:27:03,415 --> 00:27:04,415
Pay no attention to that.

481
00:27:04,415 --> 00:27:06,415
Transmission. - oh, fred.

482
00:27:06,415 --> 00:27:06,415
- Judy!

483
00:27:06,415 --> 00:27:11,415
- There's so much that I wanted to say to you or sing to you or sing with you.

484
00:27:11,415 --> 00:27:11,415
That's all I've ever wanted.

485
00:27:11,415 --> 00:27:14,415
You've always known that to be true, right?

486
00:27:14,415 --> 00:27:17,415
- Yes, judy, yes.

487
00:27:17,415 --> 00:27:18,415
- I knew you did.

488
00:27:18,415 --> 00:27:21,415
- Okay, judy, listen carefully.

489
00:27:21,415 --> 00:27:22,415
- Yes, fred?

490
00:27:22,415 --> 00:27:24,415
- You are under a bed right now.

491
00:27:24,415 --> 00:27:25,415
- Ah!

492
00:27:25,415 --> 00:27:26,415
- No!

493
00:27:26,415 --> 00:27:27,415
Judy!

494
00:27:27,415 --> 00:27:29,415
No!

495
00:27:29,415 --> 00:27:29,415
- Relax.

496
00:27:29,415 --> 00:27:31,415
We are going to rescue her.

497
00:27:31,415 --> 00:27:33,415
Hey, hey, hey.

498
00:27:33,415 --> 00:27:35,415
Why don't you have your seat belt on?

499
00:27:35,415 --> 00:27:38,415
- Oh, sorry, dad.

500
00:27:38,415 --> 00:27:41,415
I hope mom doesn't get worried if she notices I'm not home in the middle of the night.

501
00:27:41,415 --> 00:27:43,415
- She knows exactly where you are.

502
00:27:43,415 --> 00:27:46,415
- I've got your mail right here.

503
00:27:46,415 --> 00:27:49,415
Take that!

504
00:27:49,415 --> 00:27:55,415
Don't mess with my son!

505
00:27:55,415 --> 00:27:58,415
- What a crazy dream.

506
00:27:58,415 --> 00:28:01,415
But I think I know what it means.

507
00:28:01,415 --> 00:28:02,415
I got it!

508
00:28:02,415 --> 00:28:04,415
Judy wants me to come find her.

509
00:28:04,415 --> 00:28:13,415
We have a psychic connection, and the dream is the only way she could possibly communicate with me.

510
00:28:13,415 --> 00:28:16,415
I found judy's address on this map.

511
00:28:16,415 --> 00:28:17,415
56 Meadow lane.

512
00:28:17,415 --> 00:28:20,415
Sounds beautiful, doesn't it?

513
00:28:20,415 --> 00:28:24,415
Meadow.

514
00:28:24,415 --> 00:28:28,415
I wonder what judy's house looks like?

515
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:30,415
Oh, it's nice.

516
00:28:30,415 --> 00:28:31,415
Jeez.

517
00:28:31,415 --> 00:28:34,415
If I zoom in, I wonder if I can see her.

518
00:28:34,415 --> 00:28:35,415
?? Zoom zoom ??

519
00:28:35,415 --> 00:28:38,415
?? zoom ??

520
00:28:38,415 --> 00:28:40,415
[gasps] Eww!

521
00:28:40,415 --> 00:28:44,415
That must be the guy who lived there before her.

522
00:28:44,415 --> 00:28:45,415
Oh, that is sick.

523
00:28:45,415 --> 00:28:47,415
He pooped inside her bathroom.

524
00:28:47,415 --> 00:28:51,415
The ghost of that guy's poops will be inside judy's bathroom forever.

525
00:28:51,415 --> 00:28:53,415
What if they come back to life, huh?

526
00:28:53,415 --> 00:28:56,415
I have got to get judy out of that house.

527
00:28:56,415 --> 00:28:58,415
There's only one problem.

528
00:28:58,415 --> 00:29:00,415
The woods.

529
00:29:00,415 --> 00:29:04,415
[wolf howls] I have to avoid the woods.

530
00:29:04,415 --> 00:29:08,415
[wolf howls] I have to.

531
00:29:08,415 --> 00:29:12,415
I mean, I'd be way too scared to go back in there ..

532
00:29:12,415 --> 00:29:14,415
..

533
00:29:14,415 --> 00:29:15,415
..

534
00:29:15,415 --> 00:29:22,415
Weiss.

535
00:29:22,415 --> 00:29:28,415
- I'll get it.

536
00:29:28,415 --> 00:29:38,415
[animal roaring] ..

537
00:29:38,415 --> 00:29:42,415
He never came out of those woods, never.

538
00:29:42,415 --> 00:29:45,415
Scary.

539
00:29:45,415 --> 00:29:46,415
- 911. What's your emergency?

540
00:29:46,415 --> 00:29:50,415
- I need to know what bus to take from my house to judy's house, avoiding the woods.

541
00:29:50,415 --> 00:29:52,415
- Sir, I think you meant to dial 411.

542
00:29:52,415 --> 00:29:55,415
This line is for emergencies only.

543
00:29:55,415 --> 00:29:56,415
- This is an emergency!

544
00:29:56,415 --> 00:30:01,415
Judy moved away, and I have to get to her house so I can invite her over to my house so we can sing together.

545
00:30:01,415 --> 00:30:03,415
- Sir, please dial 411.

546
00:30:03,415 --> 00:30:06,415
[hangs up] Rude.

547
00:30:06,415 --> 00:30:11,415
Turns out that there's a bus that takes me exactly one block from judy's new address.

548
00:30:11,415 --> 00:30:12,415
It's called the number seven bus.

549
00:30:12,415 --> 00:30:18,415
I have no idea how long it's gonna take me to get to judy's house, so I'm just preparing for the worst.

550
00:30:18,415 --> 00:30:23,415
..

551
00:30:23,415 --> 00:30:26,415
Do I need ketchup?

552
00:30:26,415 --> 00:30:27,415
Probably not.

553
00:30:27,415 --> 00:30:30,415
But it could be dangerous out there.

554
00:30:30,415 --> 00:30:34,415
I'm coming for you, judy!

555
00:30:34,415 --> 00:30:37,415
[battle sounds] I'm coming!

556
00:30:37,415 --> 00:30:48,415
[screaming] I'm coming, judy!

557
00:30:48,415 --> 00:30:52,415
Wait for me!

558
00:30:52,415 --> 00:30:53,415
Hate ketchup.

559
00:30:53,415 --> 00:30:56,415
This'll be enough.

560
00:30:56,415 --> 00:30:57,415
Ah!

561
00:30:57,415 --> 00:30:58,415
crash!

562
00:30:58,415 --> 00:30:59,423
Ow!

563
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:28,638
[Baby coughing] - [snoring] I didn't know how much the bus cost, so i took $25.

564
00:31:32,215 --> 00:31:38,215
Well, here I go.

565
00:31:38,215 --> 00:31:46,215
Wish me luck.

566
00:31:46,215 --> 00:31:47,215
What?

567
00:31:47,215 --> 00:31:59,215
It might rain.

568
00:31:59,215 --> 00:32:08,215
Judy.

569
00:32:08,215 --> 00:32:09,215
I'm gonna do it.

570
00:32:09,215 --> 00:32:26,215
Let's do this.

571
00:32:26,215 --> 00:32:28,215
- Hey, figglehorn.

572
00:32:28,215 --> 00:32:29,215
Where you going?

573
00:32:29,215 --> 00:32:30,215
- None of your business, kevin.

574
00:32:30,215 --> 00:32:34,215
- Oh, where are you going, to a butt face convention, huh?

575
00:32:34,215 --> 00:32:36,215
- I'm just gonna ignore you.

576
00:32:36,215 --> 00:32:39,215
- Well, you're not ignoring me, 'cause you just talked to me.

577
00:32:39,215 --> 00:32:41,215
- What happened to your arm, kevin?

578
00:32:41,215 --> 00:32:43,215
Did you make a fake cast so everyone would feel sorry for you?

579
00:32:43,215 --> 00:32:44,215
- No, it's not fake.

580
00:32:44,215 --> 00:32:47,215
Actually, some guys tried to steal my bike, and I beat 'em up.

581
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:50,215
But it doesn't even matter, ..

582
00:32:50,215 --> 00:32:52,215
- Why'd they all use the same pen?

583
00:32:52,215 --> 00:32:54,215
- Because girls like the color red.

584
00:32:54,215 --> 00:32:58,215
- I bet god pushed him down 'cause he hates the way he sings.

585
00:32:58,215 --> 00:33:00,215
- What did you say?

586
00:33:00,215 --> 00:33:02,215
- I never said anything.

587
00:33:02,215 --> 00:33:02,215
I'm igning you, kevin.

588
00:33:02,215 --> 00:33:05,215
- Then why do you keep talking to me, figglehorn?

589
00:33:05,215 --> 00:33:06,215
Where are you going, anyway?

590
00:33:06,215 --> 00:33:07,215
- Why do you care?

591
00:33:07,215 --> 00:33:08,215
I'm not gonna tell you.

592
00:33:08,215 --> 00:33:11,215
- All right, then, I'll just follow you all the way there.

593
00:33:11,215 --> 00:33:12,215
How'd you like that?

594
00:33:12,215 --> 00:33:17,215
- Well, I'm here.

595
00:33:17,215 --> 00:33:18,215
- You have to take the bus?

596
00:33:18,215 --> 00:33:20,215
That is so lame, man.

597
00:33:20,215 --> 00:33:23,215
I have girls take me where I want to go.

598
00:33:23,215 --> 00:33:25,215
- I have a girl.

599
00:33:25,215 --> 00:33:26,215
- Oh, yeah. who?

600
00:33:26,215 --> 00:33:27,215
- My mom.

601
00:33:27,215 --> 00:33:28,215
- Oh, my god, man.

602
00:33:28,215 --> 00:33:29,215
Is anybody listening to this?

603
00:33:29,215 --> 00:33:31,215
You're such a loser, dude.

604
00:33:31,215 --> 00:33:34,215
Where are yog, huh?

605
00:33:34,215 --> 00:33:36,215
Where are you going, huh?

606
00:33:36,215 --> 00:33:37,215
Where you going, fred?

607
00:33:37,215 --> 00:33:39,215
Where you going, figglehorn?

608
00:33:39,215 --> 00:33:40,215
Huh? where you going?

609
00:33:40,215 --> 00:33:42,215
Oh, oh, is that your bus, fred?

610
00:33:42,215 --> 00:33:44,215
- I'm not talking to you, kevin.

611
00:33:44,215 --> 00:33:45,215
- Is that your bus?

612
00:33:45,215 --> 00:33:46,215
Gonna get on the bus?

613
00:33:46,215 --> 00:33:48,215
- Ain't got all day here.

614
00:33:48,215 --> 00:33:50,215
- [laughs] I know.

615
00:33:50,215 --> 00:33:52,215
I know where you're going.

616
00:33:52,215 --> 00:33:53,215
- Where am I going?

617
00:33:53,215 --> 00:33:56,215
..

618
00:33:56,215 --> 00:34:00,215
- Come on, kid, I got a schedule to keep here.

619
00:34:00,215 --> 00:34:02,215
- Here's $5.

620
00:34:02,215 --> 00:34:06,215
You can keep the change.

621
00:34:06,215 --> 00:34:11,215
Hi.

622
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:21,215
[gasps] Think I'll sit back here.

623
00:34:21,215 --> 00:34:22,215
Uh-oh.

624
00:34:22,215 --> 00:34:25,215
I'm supposed to be on the number seven bus.

625
00:34:25,215 --> 00:34:31,215
- This is the number six bus.

626
00:34:31,215 --> 00:34:33,215
This is the number six bus.

627
00:34:33,215 --> 00:34:40,215
- I know, but if kevin knew all the bus routes and where they were going and if I got on the right bus, he would know where I was actually going.

628
00:34:40,215 --> 00:34:43,215
So by getting on the wrong bus, he would never know I was actually going to judy's house.

629
00:34:43,215 --> 00:34:47,215
- Dude, please chill out.

630
00:34:47,215 --> 00:34:48,215
- Sorry.

631
00:34:48,215 --> 00:34:50,215
I'm just really excited.

632
00:34:50,215 --> 00:34:51,215
I'm fred.

633
00:34:51,215 --> 00:34:53,215
Fred figglehorn.

634
00:34:53,215 --> 00:34:55,215
- Derf.

635
00:34:55,215 --> 00:34:58,215
- [imitates explosion] - Dude, don't.

636
00:34:58,215 --> 00:35:00,215
That's lame.

637
00:35:00,215 --> 00:35:01,215
- Oh.

638
00:35:01,215 --> 00:35:03,215
Oh, right. I knew that.

639
00:35:03,215 --> 00:35:04,215
- So, who's judy?

640
00:35:04,215 --> 00:35:07,215
She have a sister or something?

641
00:35:07,215 --> 00:35:08,215
..

642
00:35:08,215 --> 00:35:10,215
Girlfriend.

643
00:35:10,215 --> 00:35:13,215
- No, she's not.

644
00:35:13,215 --> 00:35:13,215
- What?

645
00:35:13,215 --> 00:35:16,215
Judy is not your girlfriend.

646
00:35:16,215 --> 00:35:18,215
- You're right.

647
00:35:18,215 --> 00:35:19,215
How'd you know?

648
00:35:19,215 --> 00:35:21,215
- Lie detectors.

649
00:35:21,215 --> 00:35:23,215
- Cool.

650
00:35:23,215 --> 00:35:27,215
It's just, judy's such a smokin' hot babe.

651
00:35:27,215 --> 00:35:30,215
Every time I see her, I just tingle.

652
00:35:30,215 --> 00:35:32,215
- She makes you pee?

653
00:35:32,215 --> 00:37:17,215
" - dude, take a joke.

654
00:37:17,215 --> 00:37:18,215
What are you doing here?

655
00:37:18,215 --> 00:37:20,215
..

656
00:37:20,215 --> 00:37:22,215
Wong-a-nong-tong.

657
00:37:22,215 --> 00:37:23,215
- Yeah?

658
00:37:23,215 --> 00:37:25,215
..

659
00:37:25,215 --> 00:37:28,215
You're not wearing a swimsuit.

660
00:37:28,215 --> 00:37:29,215
- This is my swimming suit.

661
00:37:29,215 --> 00:37:34,215
I mean, sometimes I just don't like showing my body too much, because, you know, there's too much sex appeal.

662
00:37:34,215 --> 00:37:35,215
- Cute.

663
00:37:35,215 --> 00:37:37,215
- Uh, how come nobody's here?

664
00:37:37,215 --> 00:37:39,215
You're, like, the only one.

665
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:41,215
- Some kid pooped in the pool.

666
00:37:41,215 --> 00:37:42,215
- Eww!

667
00:37:42,215 --> 00:37:44,215
- The good thing is, now there's no line for the slide.

668
00:37:44,215 --> 00:37:46,215
- I-i have to go, anyway.

669
00:37:46,215 --> 00:37:48,215
- Yeah, okay, sure.

670
00:37:48,215 --> 00:37:49,215
..

671
00:37:49,215 --> 00:37:51,215
Going to my friend's house.

672
00:37:51,215 --> 00:37:52,215
Girlfriend.

673
00:37:52,215 --> 00:37:57,215
- Before you go, do you want to try something cool?

674
00:37:57,215 --> 00:37:59,215
Pretty fun, isn't it?

675
00:37:59,215 --> 00:38:00,215
- It's really fun.

676
00:38:00,215 --> 00:38:03,215
My neck is hot, but my feet are cold.

677
00:38:03,215 --> 00:38:05,215
But what if I have to go to the bathroom?

678
00:38:05,215 --> 00:38:08,215
- Don't be a wong-i-mong-pong.

679
00:38:08,215 --> 00:38:10,215
Well, I'm going swimming.

680
00:38:10,215 --> 00:38:11,215
Later.

681
00:38:11,215 --> 00:38:13,215
- I'm not a wimp!

682
00:38:13,215 --> 00:38:28,215
[fly buzzing] Mm.

683
00:38:28,215 --> 00:38:31,215
Mm.

684
00:38:31,215 --> 00:38:39,215
[voices overlapping] - Help! - somebody help her!

685
00:38:39,215 --> 00:38:40,215
She's drowning.

686
00:38:40,215 --> 00:38:41,215
- No!

687
00:38:41,215 --> 00:38:43,215
No, judy!

688
00:38:43,215 --> 00:38:44,215
I'm trapped.

689
00:38:44,215 --> 00:38:45,215
Just wait one second, judy!

690
00:38:45,215 --> 00:38:48,215
- Fred! - judy!

691
00:38:48,215 --> 00:38:51,215
- Judy, I'll save you!

692
00:38:51,215 --> 00:38:52,215
Hey, bro!

693
00:38:52,215 --> 00:38:53,215
I got it!

694
00:38:53,215 --> 00:38:55,215
Get out of the way! get out of the way!

695
00:38:55,215 --> 00:38:57,215
Move it, pop!

696
00:38:57,215 --> 00:38:59,215
Judy, I'll save you!

697
00:38:59,215 --> 00:39:01,215
Whoo!

698
00:39:01,215 --> 00:39:02,215
?? Love ??

699
00:39:02,215 --> 00:39:06,215
- [screams] - ?? Love will keep us together ??

700
00:39:06,215 --> 00:39:10,215
[together] ?? THINK OF ME BABE WHENEVER ??

701
00:39:10,215 --> 00:39:12,215
- ?? Some sweet talking girl ??

702
00:39:12,215 --> 00:39:14,215
- love won't keep you guys together.

703
00:39:14,215 --> 00:39:15,215
You guys don't love each other.

704
00:39:15,215 --> 00:39:17,215
[together] ?? DON'T MESS AROUND ??

705
00:39:17,215 --> 00:39:19,215
?? You just got to be strong ??

706
00:39:19,215 --> 00:39:21,215
- why are you guys singing together?

707
00:39:21,215 --> 00:39:23,215
- ?? 'Cause I really love you ??

708
00:39:23,215 --> 00:39:23,215
- judy.

709
00:39:23,215 --> 00:39:26,215
Judy, I thought we were gonna take it to the next level?

710
00:39:26,215 --> 00:39:28,215
No! no!

711
00:39:28,215 --> 00:39:33,215
Ow!

712
00:39:33,215 --> 00:39:34,215
Oh, my gammit.

713
00:39:34,215 --> 00:39:36,215
Oh, my gammit, I got to get going.

714
00:39:36,215 --> 00:39:39,215
I got to get to judy's house.

715
00:39:39,215 --> 00:39:49,215
[screaming] [dramatic orchestral music] ?? ??

716
00:39:49,215 --> 00:39:53,215
- so did you get the poop out of the pool yet?

717
00:39:53,215 --> 00:39:54,215
No?

718
00:39:54,215 --> 00:39:57,215
Hey, fred, you can't show up at judy's house looking like that.

719
00:39:57,215 --> 00:39:58,215
She's gonna make fun of you.

720
00:39:58,215 --> 00:40:00,215
- How did you know I was going to judy's house?

721
00:40:00,215 --> 00:40:04,215
- I didn't until just now.

722
00:40:04,215 --> 00:40:06,566
So long, dong-o-o-fong-u-song.

723
00:40:37,815 --> 00:40:39,815
- what are you doing?

724
00:40:39,815 --> 00:40:41,815
You can't be naked in here.

725
00:40:41,815 --> 00:40:42,815
- I was going to leave my underwear on.

726
00:40:42,815 --> 00:40:46,815
- Yeah, well, nobody wants to see you in your underwear.

727
00:40:46,815 --> 00:40:47,815
- I beg to differ.

728
00:40:47,815 --> 00:40:50,815
I've been told my body's pretty attractive.

729
00:40:50,815 --> 00:40:51,815
?? Uh-huh ??

730

741
00:41:10,815 --> 00:41:30,815
[screams] - I'd like a regular cleaning.

742
00:41:30,815 --> 00:41:32,815
- Would you like a fragrance?

743
00:41:32,815 --> 00:41:36,815
[sniffing] - Green apples.

744
00:41:36,815 --> 00:41:37,815
- Green apples?

745
00:41:37,815 --> 00:41:47,815
- [laughing] Can I get a green apples, please?

746
00:41:47,815 --> 00:41:49,815
- Will you watch my bag for me?

747
00:41:49,815 --> 00:41:51,815
[rings bell] - Where's your car?

748
00:41:51,815 --> 00:42:24,815
[funky dance beat] ?? ??

749
00:42:24,815 --> 00:42:26,815

750
00:42:26,815 --> 00:42:35,815
[voices overlapping] - ?? It's about to get frightening ??

00:42:54,815 --> 00:42:56,815
- I'm sorry.

767
00:42:56,815 --> 00:42:59,815
- Nice hair, moron!

768
00:42:59,815 --> 00:43:01,815
- [screams] Oh, jeez.

769
00:43:01,815 --> 00:43:10,815
[tires squeal] Oh, my god!

770
00:43:10,815 --> 00:43:12,815
They sell squirrels!

771
00:43:12,815 --> 00:43:14,815
I love squirrels.

772
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:16,815
[bell rings] - ?Cuomer ?? - squirrels.

773
00:43:16,815 --> 00:43:19,815
- I'm busy. - and I'm grooming lancelot.

774
00:43:19,815 --> 00:43:20,815
- And you're useless.

775
00:43:20,815 --> 00:43:22,815
Yes, young man?

776
00:43:22,815 --> 00:43:25,815
- Oh, hey, I was just looking at the squirrels.

777
00:43:25,815 --> 00:43:26,815
- We don't have squirrels.

778
00:43:26,815 --> 00:43:28,815
You might want to go to a park or outside.

779
00:43:28,815 --> 00:43:29,815
We do have hamsters, though.

780
00:43:29,815 --> 00:43:32,815
They're in the rodent family if you want to take a look at 'em.

781
00:43:32,815 --> 00:43:35,815
- I saw the squirrels, and I just thought they'd be the perfect ..

782
00:43:35,815 --> 00:43:37,815
- Look, I don't know her, and I don't care to know her.

783
00:43:37,815 --> 00:43:40,815
We can't help you, but presents are nice.

784
00:43:40,815 --> 00:43:40,815
I enjoy them.

785
00:43:40,815 --> 00:43:45,815
- [whispers] GARY. GARY.

786
00:43:45,815 --> 00:43:50,815
The young man believes the pomeranians are squirrels.

787
00:43:50,815 --> 00:43:50,815
- I knew that.

788
00:43:50,815 --> 00:43:51,815
- I don't think you did.

789
00:43:51,815 --> 00:43:53,815
- Excuse me. - yeah?

790
00:43:53,815 --> 00:43:54,815
- Come with me.

791
00:43:54,815 --> 00:43:57,815
- Now, by squirrels, do you mean this?

792
00:43:57,815 --> 00:43:58,815
- Yep, how much are they?

793
00:43:58,815 --> 00:44:00,815
- 795. - Okay.

794
00:44:00,815 --> 00:44:03,815
- Lorenzo, can you ring us up $795?

795
00:44:03,815 --> 00:44:05,815
- $795?

796
00:44:05,815 --> 00:44:07,815
That's how much my mom makes a year.

797
00:44:07,815 --> 00:44:09,815
That is ridiculous!

798
00:44:09,815 --> 00:44:10,815
- Never mind, lorenzo.

799
00:44:10,815 --> 00:44:11,815
He's broke.

800
00:44:11,815 --> 00:44:17,815
- Okay, well, I'm just gonna be looking around, so don't even-- don't even mind me.

801
00:44:17,815 --> 00:44:18,815
- I won't.

802
00:44:18,815 --> 00:44:19,815
- I won't even be here.

803
00:44:19,815 --> 00:44:22,815
I'll be leaving soon.

804
00:44:22,815 --> 00:44:23,815
Get in there.

805
00:44:23,815 --> 00:44:24,815
Yeah.

806
00:44:24,815 --> 00:44:29,815
[laughs] I've been wanting one of these for a while now.

807
00:44:29,815 --> 00:44:31,815
- What are you doing?

808
00:44:31,815 --> 00:44:33,815
- What are you talking about?

809
00:44:33,815 --> 00:44:35,815
- Put the dog down.

810
00:44:35,815 --> 00:44:37,815
- Dog? - squirrel.

811
00:44:37,815 --> 00:44:39,815
- Hey, put the dog down.

812
00:44:39,815 --> 00:44:40,815
- Squirrel.

813
00:44:40,815 --> 00:44:41,815
- I don't have a dog, you psycho.

814
00:44:41,815 --> 00:44:45,815
- Oh, my god, gary, he's a gang banger.

815
00:44:45,815 --> 00:44:47,815
This is mace!

816
00:44:47,815 --> 00:44:48,815
I will spray you. - no!

817
00:44:48,815 --> 00:44:49,815
- I will spray you in the eyes.

818
00:44:49,815 --> 00:44:52,815
- Lorenzo, what are you doing with mace?

819
00:44:52,815 --> 00:44:53,815
- Someone has to protect us.

820
00:44:53,815 --> 00:44:56,815

Why is there a voice in my head that doesn't even make sense?

842

Are you a space man?

00:52:35,415 --> 00:52:45,415
But when I packed my food, I forgot to pack a can opener, and this is the only can that had a handy little opener on it, and I've been walking all over, so I'm really tired, and I just got so hungry.

986
00:52:45,415 --> 00:52:47,415
- You got to chill out, man.

987
00:52:47,415 --> 00:52:48,415
- I'm going to bed.

988
00:52:48,415 --> 00:52:50,415
Will you wake me when the bus comes?

989
00:52:50,415 --> 00:52:52,415
- Maybe.

990
00:52:52,415 --> 00:52:59,415
But maybe not.

991
00:52:59,415 --> 00:53:00,415
Bus, man.

992
00:53:00,415 --> 00:53:02,415
- Thanks, derf.

993
00:53:02,415 --> 00:53:07,415
You're like the best friend I've ever had.

994
00:53:07,415 --> 00:53:09,415
..

995
00:53:09,415 --> 00:53:10,415
Obviously.

996
00:53:10,415 --> 00:53:12,415
I'm doing it!

997
00:53:12,415 --> 00:53:13,415
Wish me luck.

998
00:53:13,415 --> 00:53:24,415
I'm going to judy's house!

999
00:53:24,415 --> 00:53:28,415
- You want it?

1000
00:53:28,415 --> 00:53:33,415
Do you want it?

1001
00:53:33,415 --> 00:53:34,415
Excuse me.

1002
00:53:34,415 --> 00:53:39,415
I found this poor little animal wandering around all by herself.

1003
00:53:39,415 --> 00:53:41,415
- A squirrel!

1004
00:53:41,415 --> 00:53:42,415
It's a squirrel.

1005
00:53:42,415 --> 00:53:44,415
I'll take it.

1006
00:53:44,415 --> 00:53:46,415
This is my lucky day.

1007
00:53:46,415 --> 00:53:48,415
Oh.

1008
00:53:48,415 --> 00:53:52,415
Me and judy will be your new parents, and we'll love you forever.

1009
00:53:52,415 --> 00:53:53,415
- Meadow lane.

1010
00:53:53,415 --> 00:53:54,415
- Oh, my gammit, we're here.

1011
00:53:54,415 --> 00:54:00,415
We're gonna see your mama.

1012
00:54:00,415 --> 00:54:03,415
Here we go.

1013
00:54:03,415 --> 00:54:09,415
Judy!

1014
00:54:09,415 --> 00:54:17,415
Yes!

1015
00:54:17,415 --> 00:54:23,415
Judy.

1016
00:54:23,415 --> 00:54:25,415
- Mom, I hate it here.

1017
00:54:25,415 --> 00:54:27,415
I want to move back to our old house.

1018
00:54:27,415 --> 00:54:29,415
- Oh, stop complaining.

1019
00:54:29,415 --> 00:54:38,415
- [sighs] [crying] - Hello, miss.

1020
00:54:38,415 --> 00:54:43,415
- Who are you?

1021
00:54:43,415 --> 00:54:45,415
Fred. - it's me.

1022
00:54:45,415 --> 00:54:46,415
- I knew you'd come for me.

1023
00:54:46,415 --> 00:54:49,415
You got my psychic message.

1024
00:54:49,415 --> 00:54:50,415
- I did.

1025
00:54:50,415 --> 00:54:53,415
I brought you a gift, judy.

1026
00:54:53,415 --> 00:54:54,415
- A squirrel.

1027
00:54:54,415 --> 00:54:58,415
I love squirrels.

1028
00:54:58,415 --> 00:54:59,415
Thank you.

1029
00:54:59,415 --> 00:55:00,415
- It's nothing.

1030
00:55:00,415 --> 00:55:02,415
- How ever did you get here?

1031
00:55:02,415 --> 00:55:04,415
It must have been so hard.

1032
00:55:04,415 --> 00:55:05,415
- It was.

1033
00:55:05,415 --> 00:55:08,415
I crossed the entire city to get to you, judy.

1034
00:55:08,415 --> 00:55:10,415
Even the woods.

1035
00:55:10,415 --> 00:55:14,415
[wolf howls] - You went through the woods?

1036
00:55:14,415 --> 00:55:18,415
[wolf howls] - That's so dangerous.

1037
00:55:18,415 --> 00:55:20,415
I'd have been worried about the wild animals.

1038
00:55:20,415 --> 00:55:23,415
- I wasn't afraid of the wild animals.

1039
00:55:23,415 --> 00:55:25,415
..

1040
00:55:25,415 --> 00:55:27,415
..

1041
00:55:27,415 --> 00:55:28,415
..

1042
00:55:28,415 --> 00:55:29,415
Weiss.

1043
00:55:29,415 --> 00:55:31,415
- He's alive.

1044
00:55:31,415 --> 00:55:32,415
- He's very alive.

1045
00:55:32,415 --> 00:55:35,415
- Oh, my god, I'm so impressed with you.

1046
00:55:35,415 --> 00:55:37,415
You came all this way.

1047
00:55:37,415 --> 00:55:39,415
- But why?

1048
00:55:39,415 --> 00:55:42,415
- To see you, judy.

1049
00:55:42,415 --> 00:55:44,415
And to invite you over to my house.

1050
00:55:44,415 --> 00:55:49,415
..

1051
00:55:49,415 --> 00:55:52,415
To sing.

1052
00:55:52,415 --> 00:55:54,415
?? Do ??

00:55:54,415 --> 00:55:55,415

00:56:11,415 --> 00:56:15,415
[coughing] - Are you coming, or ain't you?

1066
00:56:15,415 --> 00:56:16,415
Can't believe it.

1067
00:56:16,415 --> 00:56:35,415
- Oh, my god, the bus!

1068
00:56:35,415 --> 00:56:49,415
[triumphant orchestral music] ?? ??

1069
00:56:49,415 --> 00:56:52,415
[voices overlapping] - Judy!

1070
00:56:52,415 --> 00:56:54,415
- Get it! get it!

1071
00:56:54,415 --> 00:56:58,415
- Judy, I'm here.

1072
00:56:58,415 --> 00:57:03,415
- Fred?

1073
00:57:03,415 --> 00:57:06,415
- Where's-- where's judy?

1074
00:57:06,415 --> 00:57:07,415
- Oh, my god.

1075
00:57:07,415 --> 00:57:10,415
Guys, it's fred!

1076
00:57:10,415 --> 00:57:15,415
[laughter] What are you doing here, fred?

1077
00:57:15,415 --> 00:57:18,415
- I think I could ask you the same question, kevin.

1078
00:57:18,415 --> 00:57:23,415
- No, you can't, 'cause I was invited, and you weren't.

1079
00:57:23,415 --> 00:57:24,415
So get out, dude.

1080
00:57:24,415 --> 00:57:26,415
- This isn't even your house, kevin.

1081
00:57:26,415 --> 00:57:29,415
You cant just tell me to leave.

1082
00:57:29,415 --> 00:57:30,415
What are all you guys doing in here anyway?

1083
00:57:30,415 --> 00:57:33,415
Just creeping around judy's house or something?

1084
00:57:33,415 --> 00:57:34,415
- What's it look like?

1085
00:57:34,415 --> 00:57:36,415
It's a party.

1086
00:57:36,415 --> 00:57:37,415
..

1087
00:57:37,415 --> 00:57:39,415
That you weren't invited to.

1088
00:57:39,415 --> 00:57:41,415
all: OH!

1089
00:57:41,415 --> 00:57:43,415
- Well, for your guys' information.

1090
00:57:43,415 --> 00:57:44,415
Judy would be happy to have me here.

1091
00:57:44,415 --> 00:57:46,415
I call her every night.

1092
00:57:46,415 --> 00:57:47,415
- Oh, my god.

1093
00:57:47,415 --> 00:57:48,415
What a loser.

1094
00:57:48,415 --> 00:57:51,415
[laughter] - Judy.

1095
00:57:51,415 --> 00:57:51,415
- Fred.

1096
00:57:51,415 --> 00:57:56,415
- Please tell me you didn't invite figglehorn to this party.

1097
00:57:56,415 --> 00:57:56,415
- What are you doing here?

1098
00:57:56,415 --> 00:57:59,415
- Don't you want to hear about how I got here?

1099
00:57:59,415 --> 00:57:59,415
It's a crazy story.

1100
00:57:59,415 --> 00:58:02,415
- Fred, I'm kind of in the middle of my party.

1101
00:58:02,415 --> 00:58:05,415
- I think she just told you to leave, mate.

1102
00:58:05,415 --> 00:58:12,415
[laughter] - Maybe you shouldn't be here.

1103
00:58:12,415 --> 00:58:14,415
- Judy.

1104
00:58:14,415 --> 00:58:15,415
You're right.

1105
00:58:15,415 --> 00:58:23,415
Maybe--maybe I shouldn't be here, because no offense to you, judy, but this party is so lame.

1106
00:58:23,415 --> 00:58:28,415
[laughs] - This isn't lame.

1107
00:58:28,415 --> 00:58:30,415
This is a good party.

1108
00:58:30,415 --> 00:58:31,415
- Yeah, now it is.

1109
00:58:31,415 --> 00:58:32,415
Oh, my god.

1110
00:58:32,415 --> 00:58:34,415
- Now it is.

1111
00:58:34,415 --> 00:58:36,415
- This is so embarrassing, fred.

1112
00:58:36,415 --> 00:58:38,415
- Judy, why are you being like this?

1113
00:58:38,415 --> 00:58:39,415
- Oh, my god, I can't do this.

1114
00:58:39,415 --> 00:58:40,415
- Judy, who are you?

1115
00:58:40,415 --> 00:58:42,415
Where's the judy I know, huh?

1116
00:58:42,415 --> 00:58:43,415
Show me her. show me the old judy.

1117
00:58:43,415 --> 00:58:46,415
- Fred, I think it would be better if you just left.

1118
00:58:46,415 --> 00:58:47,415
I'm really sorry, fred.

1119
00:58:47,415 --> 00:58:50,415
- Judy, I came all this way just for you.

1120
00:58:50,415 --> 00:58:51,415
- This isn't a girl scout convention.

1121
00:58:51,415 --> 00:58:53,415
We don't want any of your cookies.

1122
00:58:53,415 --> 00:58:58,415
all: OH!

1123
00:58:58,415 --> 00:59:10,415
[laughter] [all talking at once] - Kevin.

1124
00:59:10,415 --> 00:59:12,415
- Pizza shirt!

1125
00:59:12,415 --> 00:59:20,415
[laughter] [retches] all: OH!

1126
00:59:20,415 --> 00:59:21,415
Oh!

1127
00:59:21,415 --> 00:59:22,415
- Oh, my god!

1128
00:59:22,415 --> 00:59:24,415
- Figglehorn yakked it big time!

1129
00:59:24,415 --> 00:59:31,415
[all talking at once] - That is disgusting.

1130
00:59:31,415 --> 00:59:37,415
Oh, my gosh.

1131
00:59:37,415 --> 00:59:43,415
- [sobbing] - Fred!

1132
00:59:43,415 --> 00:59:44,415
Fred, wait!

1133
00:59:44,415 --> 00:59:46,415
- You need to send that to me.

1134
00:59:46,415 --> 00:59:47,415
- I got it. I got it.

1135
00:59:47,415 --> 01:00:04,415
[sad piano music] ?? ??

1136
01:00:04,415 --> 01:00:06,415
- hey, kid, you lost or something?

1137
01:00:06,415 --> 01:00:07,415
- Kind of.

1138
01:00:07,415 --> 01:00:09,415
- Where you going?

1139
01:00:09,415 --> 01:00:11,415
- Home.

1140
01:00:11,415 --> 01:00:13,415
- All right, my shift's over.

1141
01:00:13,415 --> 01:00:14,415
Get in. I'll take you.

1142
01:00:14,415 --> 01:00:17,415
- But I don't--i don't have another $5 bill.

1143
01:00:17,415 --> 01:00:22,415
- Get in.

1144
01:00:22,415 --> 01:00:23,415
- Thanks.

1145
01:00:23,415 --> 01:00:25,415
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1146
01:00:25,415 --> 01:01:00,415
It pays to tip.

1147
01:01:00,415 --> 01:01:02,415
- Take care, kid.

1148
01:01:02,415 --> 01:01:05,415
- Thanks.

1149
01:01:05,415 --> 01:01:06,311
- Don't.

1150
01:01:06,415 --> 01:01:07,474
That's lame.

1151
01:01:09,933 --> 01:01:10,727
- Oh.

1152
01:01:33,115 --> 01:01:35,834
[breathing heavily] [screaming] That was so humiliating!

1153
01:01:36,416 --> 01:01:39,788
I can't believe judy had a party and didn't even invite me.

1154
01:01:39,815 --> 01:01:42,196
She's not who I thought she was at all.

1155
01:01:42,407 --> 01:01:44,815
I bet you that southern accent of hers isn't even real.

1156
01:01:44,815 --> 01:01:46,815
She's probably never even been to the south.

1157
01:01:46,815 --> 01:01:49,815
- Fredd, honey, who are you talking to?

1158
01:01:49,815 --> 01:01:51,815
- Mom?

1159
01:01:51,815 --> 01:01:52,815
Mom.

1160
01:01:52,815 --> 01:01:54,815
I'm really upset right now.

1161
01:01:54,815 --> 01:01:58,815
- Well, one of your friends just sent me a video about you on the computer.

1162
01:01:58,815 --> 01:01:59,815
- About me?

1163
01:01:59,815 --> 01:02:04,815
- Yeah, you got to check it out.

1164
01:02:04,815 --> 01:02:06,815
all: OH!

1165
01:02:06,815 --> 01:02:08,815
- Oh, my god!

1166
01:02:08,815 --> 01:02:17,815
[laughter] - [screams] all: OH!

1167
01:02:17,815 --> 01:02:18,815
Oh!

1168
01:02:18,815 --> 01:02:19,815
Oh!

1169
01:02:19,815 --> 01:02:21,815
Oh! oh! oh! oh!

1170
01:02:21,815 --> 01:02:24,815
- Oh, my gammit, this is so embarrassing.

1171
01:02:24,815 --> 01:02:27,815
47 People have seen this already?

1172
01:02:27,815 --> 01:02:30,815
That's more than my entire class.

1173
01:02:30,815 --> 01:02:32,815
51 People now, 51.

1174
01:02:32,815 --> 01:02:36,815
That's, like, three more people than last time.

1175
01:02:36,815 --> 01:02:37,815
Who posted this?

1176
01:02:37,815 --> 01:02:42,815
Kev smell my fart?

1177
01:02:42,815 --> 01:02:43,815
Kevin!

1178
01:02:43,815 --> 01:02:47,815
Oh, what a stupid user name and an even more stupid video.

1179
01:02:47,815 --> 01:02:50,815
Gosh, why do people watch other people on blue tube?

1180
01:02:50,815 --> 01:02:52,815
It's weird. it's cree.

1181
01:02:52,815 --> 01:02:53,815
I don't get it.

1182
01:02:53,815 --> 01:02:55,815
I just don't.

1183
01:02:55,815 --> 01:02:59,815
Oh, my gosh, another person just watched it!

1184
01:02:59,815 --> 01:02:59,815
And another!

1185
01:02:59,815 --> 01:03:04,815
Oh, my gosh, in 60 seconds, 60 people will have seen this.

1186
01:03:04,815 --> 01:03:06,815
This is horrible.

1187
01:03:06,815 --> 01:03:10,815
Imagine how many people will have seen it in a year.

1188
01:03:10,815 --> 01:03:12,815
Well, I'm not gonna stand for this.

1189
01:03:12,815 --> 01:03:13,815
No. no.

1190
01:03:13,815 --> 01:03:21,815
I'm gonna have a party, and no one's gonna be invited.

1191
01:03:21,815 --> 01:03:33,815
[rings doorbell repeatedly] - [clears throat] Hi, fred.

1192
01:03:33,815 --> 01:03:34,815

1193
01:03:34,815 --> 01:03:35,815
Hi, miss leebo.

1196
01:03:37,815 --> 01:03:38,815
Come on in.

1197
01:03:38,815 --> 01:03:39,815
Kevin, your friend is here.

1198
01:03:39,815 --> 01:03:41,815

01:03:41,815 --> 01:03:42,815

1200
01:03:42,815 --> 01:03:43,815
I'm sorry.

1201
01:03:43,815 --> 01:03:44,815
- Where's the toilet paper?

1202
01:03:44,815 --> 01:03:48,815
Whoa, whoa, whoa, who invited figglehorn here?

1203
01:03:48,815 --> 01:03:49,815
- I did.

1204
01:03:49,815 --> 01:03:50,815
Kevin, be polite.

1205
01:03:50,815 --> 01:03:51,815
- It's okay.

1206
01:03:51,815 --> 01:03:53,815
Kevin, I'm having a party tonight.

1207
01:03:53,815 --> 01:03:54,815
That's why I came over.

1208
01:03:54,815 --> 01:03:56,815
- See, kevin? - yeah, it's gonna be awesome.

1209
01:03:56,815 --> 01:04:02,815
I mean, there's gonna be lots of games and food and music, and we're gonna do a lot of illegal stuff kids our age can't do, but we're gonna do it anyway.

1210
01:04:02,815 --> 01:04:04,815
- What? - it's gonna be great.

1211
01:04:04,815 --> 01:04:05,815
- Oh, that sounds like fun.

1212
01:04:05,815 --> 01:04:07,815
- All right.

1213
01:04:07,815 --> 01:04:10,815
Okay.

1214
01:04:10,815 --> 01:04:13,815
- Here.

1215
01:04:13,815 --> 01:04:15,815
- I met your father at a party.

1216
01:04:15,815 --> 01:04:16,815
- Mom.

1217
01:04:16,815 --> 01:04:17,815
That's disgusting.

1218
01:04:17,815 --> 01:04:22,815
Come on.

1219
01:04:22,815 --> 01:04:23,815
What is this?

1220
01:04:23,815 --> 01:04:25,815
- Your dis-invitation.

1221
01:04:25,815 --> 01:04:30,815
I'm having a party, and you can't come.

1222
01:04:30,815 --> 01:04:32,815
- I'm--i'm trying to get it.

1223
01:04:32,815 --> 01:04:36,815
- I have to go right now, 'cause there's a lot of other people I have to dis-invite to my party.

1224
01:04:36,815 --> 01:04:38,815
Ha! ha!

1225
01:04:38,815 --> 01:04:39,815
- Oh, what a sweet kid.

1226
01:04:39,815 --> 01:04:41,815
Yeah, I'm glad you're friends.

1227
01:04:41,815 --> 01:04:42,815
- I'm not friends with him.

1228
01:04:42,815 --> 01:04:44,815
- Oh, well, you should be, 'cause he seems popular.

1229
01:04:44,815 --> 01:04:45,815
- Mom, I'm not even friends with him.

1230
01:04:45,815 --> 01:04:46,815
- I would be, 'cause he's popular.

1231
01:04:46,815 --> 01:04:47,815
- Mom, I'm not friends with him.

1232
01:04:47,815 --> 01:04:50,815
- stop touching my hat.

1233
01:04:50,815 --> 01:04:53,815
- Oh, gosh, right. don't touch the hat.

1234
01:04:53,815 --> 01:04:57,815
- Just wanted to make sure you knew you weren't invited.

1235
01:04:57,815 --> 01:04:59,815
Bye.

1236
01:04:59,815 --> 01:05:03,815
Oh, oh, it looks like you got my message ..

1237
01:05:03,815 --> 01:05:04,815

To my party!

1239
01:05:06,815 --> 01:05:07,815
Sucker!

1240
01:05:07,815 --> 01:05:14,815
- And I asked everyone, and they all specifically said you weren't cool, so here you go.

1241
01:05:14,815 --> 01:05:16,815
One for you.

1242
01:05:16,815 --> 01:05:18,815
And one for you.

1243
01:05:18,815 --> 01:05:20,815
Both not invited!

1244
01:05:20,815 --> 01:05:22,815
[laughs] Hey, guys.

1245
01:05:22,815 --> 01:05:29,815
Just wanted to let you guys know that I was having a party, but you're not invited!

1246
01:05:29,815 --> 01:05:40,815
[laughing] [furiously ringing doorbell] - What's up, moron?

1247
01:05:40,815 --> 01:05:41,815

I saw that video of you online.

1254
01:05:48,815 --> 01:05:51,815
- [sarcastic laughter] It's so funny, isn't it?

1255
01:05:51,815 --> 01:05:51,815
Everyone saw it.

1256
01:05:51,815 --> 01:05:53,815
I'm not stupid. I know.

1257

I get it.

1258

I'm over it.

1259
01:05:55,815 --> 01:05:55,815
Anyways, here.

1260
01:05:55,815 --> 01:05:59,815
You're not invited and I never was gonna invite you anyway.

1261
01:05:59,815 --> 01:05:59,815
See ya.

1262
01:05:59,815 --> 01:06:00,815
Gonna be fun without you.

1263
01:06:00,815 --> 01:06:04,815
- I didn't think that video was funny.

1264
01:06:04,815 --> 01:06:05,815
Are you serious?

1265
01:06:05,815 --> 01:06:06,815

Oh, but you weren't laughing, were you?

- You weren't?

1270
01:06:19,815 --> 01:06:21,815
Well, I don't know.

1271
01:06:21,815 --> 01:06:24,815
I guess I just assumed.

1272
01:06:24,815 --> 01:06:27,815
Well, anyways, I'm gonna go get ready for my party.

Would you maybe want to-- like, you can just come to my party maybe just for a little bit.

1279
01:06:40,815 --> 01:06:45,815
You don't have to stay the whole time, but do you want to come, maybe.

01:13:20,815 --> 01:13:21,815
?? you'll feel it in your bones ??

1476
01:13:21,815 --> 01:13:24,815
?? and when the bass drum cracks ??

1477
01:13:24,815 --> 01:13:25,815

1487
01:13:42,815 --> 01:13:44,815
?? until we fall asleep, baby ??

1488
01:13:44,815 --> 01:13:44,815
?? that's the life ??

1489
01:13:44,815 --> 01:13:46,815
?? it's just another day ??

1490
01:13:46,815 --> 01:13:47,815
?? on the way to the top ??

1491
01:13:47,815 --> 01:13:48,815
?? you've got to live it up ??

1492
01:13:48,815 --> 01:13:56,815

01:14:49,815 --> 01:14:53,815
- I wanted to make it to fred's party, but my girl didn't want to go.

1514
01:14:53,815 --> 01:14:55,815
I like to party; she don't like to party.

1515
01:14:55,815 --> 01:14:57,815
I like to break it down.

1516
01:14:57,815 --> 01:15:04,815
[sighs] I will be at the next one.

1517
01:15:04,815 --> 01:15:07,815
- Oh, it was an epic fail of me not to go to fred's.

1518
01:15:07,815 --> 01:15:17,815
I mean, I wasn't invited, but I'm sure it's 'cause I wasn't around when he was inviting people.

1519
01:15:17,815 --> 01:15:20,815
..

1520
01:15:20,815 --> 01:15:23,815
A lot.

1521
01:15:23,815 --> 01:15:29,815
- I would totally go out with fred, but judy's, like, my best friend, and I would never do that to her.

1522
01:15:29,815 --> 01:15:37,815
- I was at fred's house, and, like-- [laughs] And we, like, hurled together.

1523
01:15:37,815 --> 01:15:39,815
I mean, we--we crossed-hurled.

1524
01:15:39,815 --> 01:15:47,815
[laughter] - I don't care that I wasn't invited to fred's party, you know?

1525
01:15:47,815 --> 01:15:49,815
I don't--i don't care at all.

1526
01:15:49,815 --> 01:15:50,815
I don't. I really don't.

1527
01:15:50,815 --> 01:15:54,815
I don't know why everyone's asking me that.

1528
01:15:54,815 --> 01:15:56,815
Like, you know?

1529
01:15:56,815 --> 01:15:57,815
Who--who was there?

1530
01:15:57,815 --> 01:16:02,815
- Best party ever, right?

1531
01:16:02,815 --> 01:16:05,815
Boys, quit staring.

1532
01:16:05,815 --> 01:16:08,815
- My friends, I don't-- where'd my friends go?

1533
01:16:08,815 --> 01:16:10,815
Hey, guys.

1534
01:16:10,815 --> 01:16:11,815
Guys.

1535
01:16:11,815 --> 01:16:12,815
- Hoo!

1536
01:16:12,815 --> 01:16:15,815
Hey-hey, that was some party.

1537
01:16:15,815 --> 01:16:17,815
Hey, mister.

1538
01:16:17,815 --> 01:16:20,815
Aren't you supposed to be in school?

1539
01:16:20,815 --> 01:16:21,815
- Hi, mom.

1540
01:16:21,815 --> 01:16:23,815
- You sure know how to throw a little party.

1541
01:16:23,815 --> 01:16:25,815
- It was over yesterday.

1542
01:16:25,815 --> 01:16:26,815
- Yeah?

1543
01:16:26,815 --> 01:16:28,815
Did your girlfriend judy show up?

1544
01:16:28,815 --> 01:16:29,815
- Mom, no, she didn't.

1545
01:16:29,815 --> 01:16:31,815
She's not my girlfriend anyway.

1546
01:16:31,815 --> 01:16:32,815
- Hey, listen, so what?

1547
01:16:32,815 --> 01:16:33,815
She's probably just playing hard to get.

1548
01:16:33,815 --> 01:16:36,815
There'll be others knocking your doorstep down.

1549
01:16:36,815 --> 01:16:40,815
She'd be lucky to have you as a boyfriend, 'cause you're good looking, 'cause you're a figglehorn.

1550
01:16:40,815 --> 01:16:42,815
- I am a figglehorn, mom, thanks.

1551
01:16:42,815 --> 01:16:44,815
- Anyway, I keep getting their family's mail.

1552
01:16:44,815 --> 01:16:46,815
Who's she think she is?

1553
01:16:46,815 --> 01:16:48,815
- I thought you said you were gonna toss all the mail, mom.

1554
01:16:48,815 --> 01:16:51,815
- Yeah, well, I'm a big talker.

1555
01:16:51,815 --> 01:16:53,815
What you look-- oh, nice house.

1556
01:16:53,815 --> 01:16:54,815
- Yeah, it's judy's house.

1557
01:16:54,815 --> 01:16:57,815
- Is that the house where you hurled?

1558
01:16:57,815 --> 01:17:00,815
- Mm-hmm.

1559
01:17:00,815 --> 01:17:01,815
- Hey.

1560
01:17:01,815 --> 01:17:03,815
I know that guy.

1561
01:17:03,815 --> 01:17:06,815
That's danny genetti.

1562
01:17:06,815 --> 01:17:07,815
- Eww!

1563
01:17:07,815 --> 01:17:08,815
How do you know him?

1564
01:17:08,815 --> 01:17:10,815
- We had a date once.

1565
01:17:10,815 --> 01:17:11,815
- When was that?

1566
01:17:11,815 --> 01:17:16,815
- That was about, I don't know, 15 years ago.

1567
01:17:16,815 --> 01:17:19,815
- I'm 15.

1568
01:17:19,815 --> 01:17:20,815
- I'm taking a nap.

1569
01:17:20,815 --> 01:17:22,815
- You just got up, mom.

1570
01:17:22,815 --> 01:17:23,815
- Yeah, well, whatever.

1571
01:17:23,815 --> 01:17:25,815
I'm taking a nap.

1572
01:17:25,815 --> 01:17:28,815
- [gasps] Dad!

1573
01:17:28,815 --> 01:17:30,815
What are you doing here?

1574
01:17:30,815 --> 01:17:34,815
- Taking a nap!

1575
01:17:34,815 --> 01:17:42,815
[doorbell rings] - Judy.

1576
01:17:42,815 --> 01:17:43,815
- Hi, fred.

1577
01:17:43,815 --> 01:17:45,815
- You're tall.

1578
01:17:45,815 --> 01:17:49,815
- Oh, it's the shoes.

1579
01:17:49,815 --> 01:17:50,815
You weren't at school today.

1580
01:17:50,815 --> 01:17:52,815
I hope you're not sick.

1581
01:17:52,815 --> 01:17:54,815
- I-i'm not sick, not sick at all.

1582
01:17:54,815 --> 01:17:57,815
- Were you taking a nap, then?

1583
01:17:57,815 --> 01:17:59,815
- No.

1584
01:17:59,815 --> 01:18:02,815
- Why are you wearing your pajamas?

1585
01:18:02,815 --> 01:18:04,815
- These aren't pajamas.

1586
01:18:04,815 --> 01:18:07,815
They're loungewear.

1587
01:18:07,815 --> 01:18:13,815
- Oh.

1588
01:18:13,815 --> 01:18:15,815
..

1589
01:18:15,815 --> 01:18:17,815
What do you want?

1590
01:18:17,815 --> 01:18:21,815
- I wanted to see you, fred.

1591
01:18:21,815 --> 01:18:22,815
- Really?

1592
01:18:22,815 --> 01:18:23,815
- I really wanted to apologize.

1593
01:18:23,815 --> 01:18:28,815
I just felt like I've been really mean, and I should have invited you to my party.

1594
01:18:28,815 --> 01:18:30,815
I'm really sorry.

1595
01:18:30,815 --> 01:18:32,815
- Don't worry, I'm totally over it.

1596
01:18:32,815 --> 01:18:35,815
- Well, I totally deserved to be barfed all over.

1597
01:18:35,815 --> 01:18:39,815
[laughter] - Want me to do it again?

1598
01:18:39,815 --> 01:18:41,815
[retches] - Nice.

1599
01:18:41,815 --> 01:18:45,815
- Apology accepted. - thank you.

1600
01:18:45,815 --> 01:18:48,815
So, can I come in?

1601
01:18:48,815 --> 01:18:49,815
- Like, into my house?

1602
01:18:49,815 --> 01:18:53,815
- I just thought we could hang out.

1603
01:18:53,815 --> 01:18:55,815
- And--and do what?

1604
01:18:55,815 --> 01:18:58,815
- I don't know.

1605
01:18:58,815 --> 01:19:03,815
..

1606
01:19:03,815 --> 01:19:05,815
I thought we could sing together.

1607
01:19:05,815 --> 01:19:11,815
- [sobbing] - Sing?

1608
01:19:11,815 --> 01:19:13,815
Me and you, like, together?

1609
01:19:13,815 --> 01:19:15,815
Singing?

1610
01:19:15,815 --> 01:19:17,815
Just--just hold on one second, okay?

1611
01:19:17,815 --> 01:19:21,815
- Sure.

1612
01:19:21,815 --> 01:19:33,815

1613
01:19:33,815 --> 01:19:34,815
- Won't you come in?

1614
01:19:34,875 --> 01:19:36,018
- Thank you.
