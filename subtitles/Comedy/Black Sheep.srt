2
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:55,100
(people chanting)
Al Donnelly! Al Donnelly! Al Donnelly!

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,200
And now let's welcome
our hometown hero,

4
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,700
the next governor
of Washington, Al Donnelly!

5
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:12,600
(cheering)

6
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:19,500
Attention, Buckley residents.
Voters of all ages, vote for Al Donnelly.

7
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:23,700
He's the best man for the job.
You can count on Al, that's for sure.

8
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:28,200
Folks, if you're wondering who to vote
for, Al Donnelly's the man for the job.

9
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:35,800
I have to go home now, little doggies.
Nothing for you in this truck. No food.

10
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:39,500
Dogs, I want you to go home.

11
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,300
Get off my bumper!

12
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,900
Come on! Jesus!

13
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,000
Aaagh!

14
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,500
Oh, God!

15
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:55,200
Oh, my God.

16
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:03,300
What is with you dogs?! D'you think
this truck is in heat or something?

17
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,300
Get out of here!

18
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,800
If I got the same welcome everywhere
I went that I got here in my home town,

19
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:14,500
my candidacy would be a lock!

20
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,100
(cheering)

21
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,000
(barks)

22
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,400
With your help, we will make it
all the way to the Capitol!

23
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:37,800
(chanting) Al Donnelly! Al Donnelly!
Al Donnelly! Al Donnelly!

24
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:40,800
(amplified barking and growling)

25
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:47,600
- Did you do this?
- No, no, no... Did you?

26
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,600
(growling)

27
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,400
Oh, my God.

28
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,200
Oh, my God.

29
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,400
- (woman screams)
- Mother...

30
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,300
Oh, there is a God.

31
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,200
Tell me that is not your brother.

32
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:45,800
What the hell is a marquee doin' here?
It's crazy!

33
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:53,700
Al, I'm so sorry.
Man, I don't know what happened.

34
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,500
Mike, forget it.
Did you think it was a drive-in movie?

35
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,400
(both laugh)

36
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,700
(blasts horn)

37
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,200
I could get time off from the rec centre.
They said I could, to help you campaign.

38
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:09,400
So I was thinking maybe I could go
on the road with you and help out, or...

39
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:14,400
Mike, I know you're behind me 100%,
but I need some different help from you.

40
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,300
Oh, man, whatever you want.
You know that.

41
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,800
- Fighting Donnellys stick together!
- Right!

42
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:23,700
Listen, I got a lot of good people
in my corner. They want what we want.

43
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:27,800
And we're gonna get there.
It's just gonna take some finesse.

44
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,800
I'll do anything.
Just name it and I'll get started.

45
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,800
There's a lot to be done right here,
like phone canvassing, stuff like that.

46
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:38,000
So stay put and I'll get you
the details. All right?

47
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,800
- We gonna do it, little brother?
- Yeah!

48
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:46,200
- Come on. Let's go.
- All the way, Governor.

49
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,800
Dock Workers' Union.

50
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,300
Let me make myself clear.
My brother is a priority.

51
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,900
Let's just find someone
in the organisation.

52
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:07,700
Just as long as he or she is reliable
and helps Mike make a contribution.

53
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,600
So just find someone and
give them the assignment... now.

54
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:15,500
<i>(man) Excuse me,  Mr "About to be
Governor Elect" Donnelly.</i>

55
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:21,100
<i>This assignment you describe,
if someone volunteered and did it well, </i>

56
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:24,600
would he or she earn a staff position
in your new administration?

57
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:29,000
- Steve, not now.
- Hey. Uh, yes.

58
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:31,600
He or she most certainly would.

59
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,200
Then I am your man.

60
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,000
(ringing tone)

61
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:44,700
Hi. This is Mike Donnelly. I work
over here at the recreational centre.

62
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,200
To be honest,
I pretty much run the place!

63
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:50,200
Is this, uh, Pat Giles?

64
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,500
Good. Good.

65
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:56,900
Hey, I hope everything's going great in
your fine town of, uh, Avery... Atwood.

66
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:02,200
The reason I'm calling is I wanted to tell
you about the candidacy of Al Donnelly.

67
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:07,100
Al Donnelly's a guy with a dream. His
dream is to be governor of Washington.

68
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:13,300
Hell, every guy's got his dream, am I
right? I had a doozie myself last night!

69
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:18,100
Get this: a cornfed harvest mouse,
a hooker, a nun, a Flemish woman,

70
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:22,000
whips, chains, whistles,
yo-yos, a circus midget,

71
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:26,000
my grandmother riding by on a bicycle
giving me the finger, and a duck.

72
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:29,400
Now, I don't know... Are you crying?

73
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,200
Oh, my Lord. I am sorry.

74
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:35,600
Honey, please don't. Could you
get your daddy on the phone?

75
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,300
- No, don't hang up, please. I...
- (hangs up)

76
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Whoa.

77
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:48,900
All right, I want a 32 belly option
on two, on two. Ready? Break!

78
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,900
Hut one. Hut two.

79
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,900
Let's do it!

80
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,400
Oh, hey, little girls.

81
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:11,100
Yeah!

82
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:14,700
(cheering and whooping)

83
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,000
This sucks! These teams aren't fair.

84
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,400
What's wrong, Sullivan? You mad cos
you found out the new kid got an arm?

85
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:25,100
- Suckers, take the walk.
- Screw this. I quit.

86
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:29,500
Fine then. Here's to the winners. Yeah!

87
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:33,600
Kemp, fake head butt. DeSalvo, fake
head butt. New kid, fake head butt.

88
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,800
Ow! You broke my nose!

89
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,200
Oh!

90
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:42,400
- There's so much blood.
- I swear I did not mean to do it! Please!

91
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,500
- Ketchup packet.
- (laughter)

92
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:47,600
Come on, guys. This is weird.
Let's go play some kickball.

93
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,500
Yeah, come on.

94
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,900
Forget those guys.

95
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:56,500
- What's your name?
- Scott Colleary.

96
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,100
Colleary.

97
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:01,000
- You got a hell of an arm, Colleary.
- Thanks.

98
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,500
Yeah.

99
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,600
- Don't worry about those guys.
- They don't like me too much.

100
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,900
- Is your mom picking you up?
- My mom and dad got a divorce.

101
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,400
I have to live with my grandma now.

102
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:21,400
Oh, come on. Label your streets
like the rest of the country.

103
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,600
Oh! Oh! Buddy, are you OK?

104
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:32,000
I'm not that far from dragging you
out of the car and beating you into dust.

105
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:35,800
You should work up to that.
Kind of leaves you nowhere to go.

106
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:40,400
I can go to your mama's
and start a small fire in her panties.

107
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:42,700
Now, are you ready
to get out of the car?

108
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,800
No, sir. You know what?
That was my fault and I'm really sorry.

109
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:50,400
Here, I got something for you.
It's a souvenir.

110
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,900
Oh, here it is! Yeah!

111
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,500
Goodbye!

112
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,200
- Oh, shit.
- (honking)

113
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,100
I don't believe this.

114
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:06,400
Damn it. I gotta ditch this guy.

115
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,900
Hey!

116
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:24,800
- That's my grandma. Mrs Oneacre.
- Hi, ma'am.

117
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,000
Bet you made
some nice friends today, huh?

118
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:30,800
(Scott) See ya.

119
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:37,200
Scott. God gave you
a hell of a throwin' arm,

120
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,400
and I'll be damned
if I'll let that go to waste.

121
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:43,000
I want you on the field every day
working on your game. How's that?

122
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,400
- Sure.
- Nice to meet you, ma'am.

123
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,700
- Hey, Mikey.
- Hey, Robbie.

124
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:08,300
I spoke to Anderson at the theatre.
He wants me to lock you up.

125
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,500
I bet your brother's pissed, huh?

126
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:14,200
No, he was pretty cool, as usual.

127
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:16,000
I wanna show you something.

128
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:19,400
In fact, I'm gonna be working
with one of his top guys.

129
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:25,400
Whoa! Nitrous oxide boosters!

130
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:28,800
- This thing must haul major ass.
- You could say that.

131
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,600
Oh, great.

132
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,400
Damn it.

133
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:44,100
- Get out of my way, buddy.
- Lady, I got somethin' for ya.

134
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,400
- A souvenir for you here.
- Yes?

135
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,200
Never mind. Forget it.

136
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:54,000
What are you doing?
Playing pocket pool there, son?

137
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:57,200
- Excuse me.
- You got a little chubby goin' there.

138
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,800
Dream on, you little fart.

139
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:17,000
Please don't be Mike Donnelly.

140
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:17,700
Hi.

141
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:21,600
Hey. I'm Steve Dodds,
one of your brother's advisors.

142
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:25,500
- His top advisor, actually.
- Wow. It's great to meet you.

143
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:28,700
Nice to, um, see you.

144
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:32,100
Al, your brother, told me
to drop everything, come down here,

145
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:35,000
get you organised for the final push,
for the election.

146
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Well, let's get to it. Team Donnelly
gonna kick a little Tracy butt.

147
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,700
Oh! Aaargh!

148
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:46,200
What I thought is, we'd start with the
supermarket, canvass that area first.

149
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:48,800
- I...
- No, trust me on this. It's a good idea.

150
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,500
- But...
- Listen, I'm running this show.

151
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,500
- I know what I'm doing.
- (moans)

152
00:11:55,300 --> 00:12:00,000
- D'you have to go to the bathroom?
- Please... pop... the hood.

153
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,200
- Please!
- Oh, your thumbs. The hood. OK.

154
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:06,900
- What latch? Where d'you want me to...
- Just pop the hood!

155
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,900
Please!

156
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:11,000
Popping the hood.

157
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,700
(wails)

158
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,400
Good afternoon. We'd like you
to vote Al Donnelly for governor.

159
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,300
Yeah, thanks.

160
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:25,000
- Hi, ma'am.
- (gasps)

161
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:28,300
Vote for Donnelly.

162
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,200
Sorry.

163
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:32,900
I think it's better
if we bring the energy down a tad.

164
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:35,400
Are you kidding me?
These are potential voters.

165
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:38,600
It's showmanship.
You gotta go out and get 'em.

166
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,500
Watch and learn.

167
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:43,900
- Hi, folks. Vote for Donnelly!
- Good God, man.

168
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:46,600
- Let me get that for you.
- Look, I drove down here.

169
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:51,000
- I can put the groceries in the trunk.
- Help from the Donnelly campaign.

170
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,600
- Back off, buster.
- Oh!

171
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,600
- Come on, Mother.
- Let me help you, sir.

172
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:59,800
- Get in the car, dear.
- All right, Mother.

173
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,200
Folks, I'm having a little trouble here.

174
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:13,100
Help! Help, please!

175
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,100
He must be all hopped up
on crack cocaine.

176
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,500
Floor it, Harold!

177
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,000
I can't! I can't!

178
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,300
Argh! Help!

179
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,500
- Good. I think I've lost him.
- Stop! Please!

180
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,700
Aargh!

181
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,300
Aargh!

182
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:49,600
OK.

183
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,700
- Good first day.
- Yeah.

184
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:00,700
Washington State.
Isn't it a great place to raise a family?

185
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:04,500
That's because for the last eight years
I've worked hard as your governor

186
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:09,200
to make sure our state
is clean, safe and fiscally sound.

187
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,600
If re-elected to a third term,
I'll do my best as your governor

188
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:16,600
to make sure that all the hopes and
dreams of Washingtonians come true.

189
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:20,200
- (man) And cut.
- I need a break. I'll be right back.

190
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,200
Did you get the latest polls?

191
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:28,500
Donnelly's brother took a campaign van
on a rampage. He can't get a break!

192
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:32,900
- But they gained another two points.
- We're OK. A lot can be done in a week.

193
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,500
If we don't do something soon,
he'll be living here.

194
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,400
Who left this crap in here?

195
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:49,000
Promise me you'll stay in the car.

196
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,100
I promise.

197
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,700
(excited chatter)

198
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:06,500
Whoa! What have we got here?
A tall cool one!

199
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,100
Yeah!

200
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:10,100
Go for it.

201
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,400
- I wanna get wrecked!
- (all laugh)

202
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,900
Oh, yeah, man!

203
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,200
# Smokin', snortin', shootin',
suckin', tokin', poppin', droppin'

204
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,700
Let's do a little dance.

205
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,700
A party with you!

206
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,800
- The kid's a star.
- No, he's a gold mine.

207
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:44,600
- (Mike) Ah. Horseshit!
- (glass smashes)

208
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:48,900
- Front page.
- Jesus, Mike!

209
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:52,800
But it turns out he was giving these
kids a speech about saying no to drugs.

210
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:57,900
- Can the paper print a retraction?
- They'll run it on page 36 in two weeks!

211
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,600
Al, you can take this election.

212
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:07,200
But your brother is creating his own
media feeding frenzy-all negative.

213
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,800
We have got to put a lid on him.

214
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,800
You're right.
But he doesn't deserve to be exiled.

215
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:17,600
You just tell Steve to watch him like a
hawk and to keep the reporters at bay.

216
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,100
(cheering)

217
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:23,900
Welcome, Washington
Teachers' Association!

218
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,800
Welcome!

219
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:31,600
Washington has the most
beautiful forests in America.

220
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:36,300
And I am proud to be
an honorary Clark County lumberjack.

221
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:46,200
- The tree's not falling.
- Yeah, I know.

222
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,500
Don't let anyone ever tell you
your job is easy.

223
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,600
Oh, my God!

224
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,100
You make the call. The rest
is for damage control. You stay put.

225
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,900
Thank you, gentlemen.
Excuse us just a moment.

226
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:14,500
What happened? It should've
gone down on the first whack.

227
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,400
You covered really well.

228
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,300
You're lucky a kid didn't get
his head cracked wide open.

229
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,400
Yes, ma'am.

230
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,200
- Did you get the numbers in?
- Oh. Hot off the wire.

231
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:30,000
- Donnelly's levelled off.
- Mm-hm. We're dead even. Look at this.

232
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,800
Front page.

233
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,900
"Donnelly's brother is like
Roger Clinton, Billy Carter

234
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:39,000
and Ronald Reagan's
entire family rolled into one."

235
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:44,100
Let's move this out of the land of
mere embarrassment into the realm...

236
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
of serious effect.

237
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:49,200
- Ready to play the game?
- I've got some pretty nasty ideas.

238
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:51,800
Good. Act on them.

239
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,600
- I've been fired.
- What? Why?

240
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:00,100
He said the rec centre's state-funded.

241
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:03,300
He can't afford to be associated
with any kind of a scandal,

242
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:06,500
especially one
involving kids and drugs.

243
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:12,100
He said he stood up for me, but word
came from the top for me to get out.

244
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,800
It's crazy, man.
I don't know what to say.

245
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:19,200
I love this job. I've been here
since the place opened.

246
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,900
And then they just...

247
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:30,700
Dude, can I get a couple of minutes
just to clear some of the gear out?

248
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,900
Yeah, sure.

249
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:35,300
Hey, I'm sorry, man. Take your time.

250
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,300
(chatter)

251
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:51,500
Hey, fellas. How's it goin'?
Can I help you?

252
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:58,500
Hey, Mike. How's things? Kind of
pissed off about losing your job, huh?

253
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:03,800
- All right, pal. What's goin' on here?
- You shouldn't play with matches.

254
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:07,300
Hey! What the hell are you doing?

255
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,700
God!

256
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,300
(Mike shouts)

257
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:23,400
Shit!

258
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,000
Oh, my God!

259
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,700
- Why in the hell?! No!
- (siren)

260
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:35,400
Mike, how the hell did this happen?

261
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:47,800
- Robbie, you know I didn't do this.
- Jesus, Mike. Give me some credit.

262
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:50,700
- Did you see who did it?
- Two guys. I don't know them.

263
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:53,800
They didn't count on me getting here
first. Look, get out of here.

264
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:58,400
When the troopers arrive, I'll tell them
I didn't find anybody here. All right?

265
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:00,700
- Go ahead. Take off.
- Thanks, Robbie.

266
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:04,200
- I owe you one, man.
- Call me later.

267
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,700
(distant sirens)

268
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:10,200
Base, this is Mieghem. I'm at the rec
centre. Send fire units and a backup.

269
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,100
I'm the only one down here.

270
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:18,300
- Well, did he do it or not?
- Kovary, I lean toward the negative.

271
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,500
- I know what you're saying.
- Shh.

272
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:23,400
Give me the phone.
Steve, it's Al. What is going on?

273
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:27,800
- Hey, Al. Well, in my opinion...
- I wanna talk to my brother.

274
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:31,500
Al, I know how this must look,
but I had nothing to do with that fire.

275
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:35,300
I loved that place. It was my life.
You gotta believe me!

276
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:39,300
I believe you. You were set up. And
we're gonna get to the bottom of this.

277
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,700
We have a game plan. Don't we, Roger?

278
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,500
- Tell me what to do and I'll do it.
- Roger and Steve'll work it out.

279
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:50,200
Mike, don't worry.
Everything is gonna be OK, I promise.

280
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,300
Thanks, Al. Thanks.

281
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:56,600
- Steve here.
- Meet me downstairs in the lobby.

282
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:02,600
Dodds, listen to me very carefully.

283
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:06,200
We have got to keep this... this bozo

284
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,900
under wraps until the election is over.

285
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:12,200
Now, I want you to do
exactly as I tell you.

286
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:15,300
- Yeah. OK. Keep talking.
- I know a place way outside town.

287
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:45,800
All right! Bunk beds!

288
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:49,000
- I got dibs on top.
- OK.

289
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:52,100
(Steve) First class, right?

290
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:54,800
- What's that black thing?
- What?

291
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,500
I don't know.

292
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:05,400
- Touch it.
- What? You touch it.

293
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,500
- You afraid?
- No, I'll touch it.

294
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,700
- You totally didn't touch it.
- Well, then you touch it.

295
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,300
- I will if you will.
- All right.

296
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,900
- (bat screeches)
- (both) Whoa! Man!

297
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:22,200
- What is that?
- It's Ozzy Osbourne. Whoa!

298
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:24,400
Oh, my God.

299
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,600
Whoa.

300
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:29,700
- I think it's gone.
- I hate those damn things.

301
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,600
- (screeching)
- Oh, man!

302
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,000
Agh! Agh!

303
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,700
It bit me! I'm gonna get rabies!

304
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,800
I'm stuck. I'm stuck.

305
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,300
Come on! Oh!

306
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:53,000
I got an idea. OK?

307
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,800
I'll open the fridge, you hit the lights.
Bats are attracted to light.

308
00:23:56,700 --> 00:24:00,100
He'll fly in the fridge,
I close the door, end of story.

309
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:04,200
- That's moths, you dumb-ass, not bats.
- Oh, yeah, moths.

310
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,600
Eegh!

311
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,000
Watch this.

312
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,900
That's it. Corner it.

313
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,500
- I think I got it.
- No way.

314
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:33,200
- I think it's in there.
- Well, then look.

315
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,500
You look.

316
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:39,800
All right. We'll both look together.

317
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:42,800
One, two...

318
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:44,800
- Three!
- Agh!

319
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,300
You idiot!

320
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:51,000
You can't catch a bat with a pot, moron.

321
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:53,800
You take a mop and a broom... Oh!

322
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,800
- Oh, God! Oh! Oh! Oh, God!
- (screeches)

323
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:07,200
Get this thing off me!
What the hell are you...

324
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,900
Ow! Ow!

325
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:12,900
Why are you hitting me? Ow!
It's gnawing at my skull.

326
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:14,400
For God's sakes!

327
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,800
Ow! Ow!

328
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:20,900
- Die! Die!
- Please! You're aggravating it!

329
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,900
Why are you kicking me? Ow!

330
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:28,400
- I can't see a damn thing!
- Die!

331
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,900
- Oh, Jesus!
- I think I nailed it!

332
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:33,800
- (screeching)
- I don't believe it. He's still alive.

333
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,700
Can we please try my idea?

334
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:41,800
Come on! Hold the thing tight
so it gets in there.

335
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:44,700
- I'm trying.
- Well, try harder. Stay over there.

336
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:49,300
Moron! OK, it's flying in now. It's flying
in now. It's flying right in the middle.

337
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,600
- It touched my hand.
- If this doesn't work I'll sleep in the car.

338
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:55,300
Stay there. OK. OK.
It's right in the middle.

339
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:58,200
OK, we got it, we got it, we got it...

340
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:00,100
It's outta there.

341
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:06,600
Good night, Steve.

342
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,400
Good night, Mike.

343
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:13,100
The police officer who arrived
before our guys was a friend of Mike's.

344
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:18,300
He let him go and didn't report seeing
him, so Mike wasn't linked to the fire.

345
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:25,800
Neuschwander, you finished stirring, or
is this a fucking science experiment?!

346
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:30,700
I realise you must stick close together
cos you share a common backbone,

347
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:33,200
but I wanna see some movement!

348
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,100
Now!

349
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:41,800
This is great. There's 1,502
registered voters in Garfield County.

350
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,700
Go get 'em, Al.

351
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:47,300
Hey, pretty good day. No screwups.
Keep up the good work.

352
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:51,300
I'm gonna go take a squeege.

353
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:01,200
Oh, God!

354
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,500
(echoes)

355
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,300
(insufficient signal tone)

356
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,200
- (insufficient signal tone)
- (sighs)

357
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,400
Eegh! Oh!

358
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,100
(insufficient signal tone)

359
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,600
What is wrong?

360
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:53,600
Oh, something tells me
I want this car to just keep driving.

361
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:58,300
Hey, gang.

362
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:03,200
Is there an Opie convention in town?

363
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:08,200
- I'm kidding.
- You're not from around here, huh?

364
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:13,200
- You know what, I am. Born and raised.
- Nope. Can't be true.

365
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,900
Fire!

366
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:38,400
Thanks for not shoving
the nozzle up my ass first!

367
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:41,400
<i>(tyres screech,  kids yell)</i>

368
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:49,400
- Vote for Donnelly.
- (echoes)

369
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,100
Every vote counts.

370
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:57,000
Argh!

371
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,900
Oh.

372
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:19,200
Aaargh!

373
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,500
No, no, no, no!

374
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:29,300
Oh. Oh.

375
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:32,700
Oh, thank you, little roots.

376
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,800
Please stay strong.

377
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:00,900
What in the hell was that all about?

378
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:18,200
You freaks better be careful,
cos next time I don't go down so easy.

379
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:21,600
Next time I'll be, like, "You wanna
spray me? How about this?"

380
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,200
Arm grab! Aie!

381
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:25,600
Snap kick! Side kick!

382
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:30,200
Rabbit punch!
Rabbit punch, into pile-driver!

383
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,700
That's right, my friend. It's a pile-driver.

384
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:35,300
Oh, who else wants some? You?

385
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,300
Sleeper hold. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

386
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,500
Hey, that's my car.

387
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,900
It's that same asshole. Whoo!

388
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:53,200
- (phone rings)
- Oh.

389
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:57,300
(imitates a "ringing" bird call)

390
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,300
What the hell was that?

391
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:10,800
Whoa, what happened to you?
D'you fall in some mud or something?

392
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:13,400
Yeah, I did. And I'm gonna be rich,

393
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:17,000
because I'm the only person on earth
who knows where to find white mud.

394
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:22,600
I didn't say "mud". I said "crud".
D'you fall into some crud or something?

395
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:27,300
- Get some water to wipe off that crud.
- I'm not a kid that'd believe that.

396
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:30,000
- Shut up, Steve. Where'd you go?
- To make a call.

397
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:35,600
Remember I told you a guy stole my
car? He's a mile away. He's driving it.

398
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:40,800
- Well, let's go get it back.
- Uh-uh. This guy is unstable, at best.

399
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:43,900
You can't keep running away
from things. You gotta be tough.

400
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:46,700
Argh! Argh!

401
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:49,900
Snakes! Oh, no!

402
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:51,800
One looked at me!

403
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:57,300
Check your underpants!
I hate those things!

404
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:02,600
- This gets worse every second.
- I hate snakes!

405
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:09,000
(both scream)

406
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:13,200
Whoa. Check it out.

407
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:17,400
- Jump in. Wash that crap off.
- There's probably piranha in there.

408
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:21,100
- This place is a nightmare.
- Get tough, nancy boy. Jump in.

409
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,700
I don't see you goin' in.

410
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:30,000
Ugh.

411
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,500
Where'd you go?

412
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:37,300
Hello, Washington!

413
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:39,700
Yeah!

414
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:42,800
Aaaargh!

415
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:16,500
De-de-de, do-do-do! (laughs)

416
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:19,300
This is great. I've never won
three games in a row.

417
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:21,400
I hardly ever play checkers.

418
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:27,200
Yeah, yeah. Well, you know,
it's kinda easy to win when you, um...

419
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:29,200
never move your back row!

420
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,400
Ever!

421
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:33,800
God! Come on!

422
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:37,800
OK, well, where would you
want me to move this one?

423
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:41,900
There.

424
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:46,400
King me!

425
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:51,800
OK. Move this one here.
It's safe, I swear. It's safe.

426
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,000
(laughs)

427
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:55,600
That wasn't safe at all.
What an idiot.

428
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:59,600
- Oh, this is fun.
- Yeah, yeah, it was.

429
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:02,000
(bird cries)

430
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:13,300
What's goin' on?

431
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,700
That's not normal.

432
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:22,400
(both scream)

433
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:46,600
How the hell did that happen?

434
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:50,600
Ow.

435
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:52,800
Oh.

436
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,800
Oh, man!

437
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,500
- This place is trashed.
- Check this out.

438
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:08,800
This whole fridge is held up here
just by this plug.

439
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,500
(Mike screams)

440
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:16,700
(groans)

441
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:24,400
You OK?

442
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:31,800
I'm just dandy! I got a bowl of
chocolate pudding in my underpants!

443
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,300
We didn't have
any pudding in there, buddy.

444
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:42,400
(Mike) This sucks. I can't believe
I forgot to call Scott Colleary.

445
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:45,000
Good luck getting out.
It's never gonna work.

446
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:47,800
Yes, it will.
All you need to do is get a signal.

447
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:49,800
(insufficient signal tone)

448
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:01,900
- (ringing tone)
- Hello?

449
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:03,600
- Hello?
- Hello?

450
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:05,000
- Hello?
- Hello?

451
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:07,700
- Mrs Oneacre? Hello? Mrs Oneacre?
- Yes.

452
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Hello? Are you there?

453
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,700
Hello. This is Mrs Oneacre.
Are you there?

454
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,100
Mrs Oneacre, it's Mike Donnelly.
Is Scott there?

455
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:22,100
No.

456
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:24,700
Oh, jeez. I had to leave town.

457
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:28,000
Could you tell him I'm sorry
and I'll make it up to him?

458
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:30,600
- Yes.
- (moans) Don't forget to tell him that.

459
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:32,600
- Bye.
- Hello?

460
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:57,000
Good night, Steve.

461
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,100
Good night, Mike.

462
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,700
(wind howling)

463
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:07,600
(creaking)

464
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,500
(snores)

465
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:20,800
Ow!

466
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:23,100
Oh, man.

467
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:27,600
- Oh, God.
- I don't like this, Mike.

468
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,100
Mike?

469
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:34,700
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

470
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:37,400
(Steve) Whoa!

471
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,100
This sucks!

472
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:48,000
- Good night, Steve.
- Good night, Mike.

473
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,600
(thunder rumbling)

474
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:15,500
Hey, Mike. "I got dibs on top bunk"!

475
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:17,100
Shut up.

476
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:19,400
(laughs derisively)

477
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,700
- Oh, I love it.
- Why don't you shut up?

478
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:23,600
"Hello, Washington!"

479
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,900
- How's the weather up there, buddy?
- Shut up!

480
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:29,800
(Steve carries on laughing)

481
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,900
Oh, no.

482
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:33,800
Ow!

483
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:39,600
- (ringing tone)
- Hello?

484
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:43,900
Hey, Roger? How you doin'?
It's Mike Donnelly. Is Al there?

485
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:46,500
Uh, gee, Mike.
Al's kind of busy right now.

486
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:53,100
Ha, I know. I just wanted to tell him
I'm working my tail off for him up here,

487
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:55,900
and there's no way
Al's gonna lose Gaffield County.

488
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:59,200
That's great. I'll be sure to tell him.
Thanks for ringing up.

489
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:02,700
Come on, let me talk to Al.
It's only gonna take a minute.

490
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:06,100
Al doesn't wanna speak to you.

491
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,300
What do you mean,
Al doesn't wanna speak to me? Why?

492
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,500
Listen very carefully to me, Mike.

493
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:14,500
You know what Al calls you
when you're not around here?

494
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:18,500
The idiot. OK? All right?
Is that blunt enough for you?

495
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,700
You are not going to speak to him now.

496
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:25,300
And if I had my way, you wouldn't speak
to him after he's elected governor!

497
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,300
(hangs up)

498
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:38,600
Kovary. Man, that guy's a dick.

499
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:41,900
Who is he to say
I can't talk to my own brother?

500
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:43,700
You know?

501
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:47,000
I ought to go down there
and straighten this thing out.

502
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
What do you think, Steve?

503
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:53,300
Al's speaking at that
Rock The Vote concert in Seattle.

504
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:55,600
Steve?

505
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,900
What do you think if I went down to...

506
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:18,400
Oh, that's sad.

507
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:49,000
(# rock music playing)

508
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,500
Hey, it's cool. I was in.

509
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:04,200
Where's the fire?

510
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:07,800
Dude, we pay these bands' salaries
by buying a ticket to this shit.

511
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:09,800
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

512
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:12,700
Okey-dokey. Come on.

513
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:17,100
Son, step away from this vector and
get into a different coordinate, pronto.

514
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,900
There's no access for you
in this quadrant.

515
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:23,600
Man, why don't you goose-step on
down to the women and children there

516
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:27,300
and give them your power trip?
They might be impressed by it, asshole!

517
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:30,100
- Yeah!
- Young fellow, I'll twist off your head

518
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,900
and spike it onto the floors
of a nightmare you can't even imagine!

519
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:37,300
I will dance with you
inside of the six-sided ring of fire,

520
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:41,500
unless you move from this area
far and fast! Now!

521
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:43,800
(music stops)

522
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,600
Wow!

523
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,300
Man, I liked that move.

524
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:54,700
Yeah, I learnt it in the '84 Bounce-Off
over at Laguna Beach.

525
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:58,700
- The one Mr T hosted.
- As a matter of fact it is. The same one.

526
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,300
(chuckles nervously)

527
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:11,400
Wow!

528
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,500
Whoopsie-daisy.

529
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:18,500
I was looking for my brother, Al
Donnelly. He's around here somewhere.

530
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:23,200
So you fellas are... performers or...

531
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Oh, no, thanks. I never touch the stuff.

532
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:33,600
There's enough in the air here
to get everybody high.

533
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:37,900
Besides, it gives you the munchies.
God knows, I don't need that. Hey!

534
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,500
But, uh...

535
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:46,900
(emcee) Rock The Vote
presents Mudhoney.

536
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:07,300
I don't think these kids wanna hear me
talk about bond issues, man.

537
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:08,900
Al, we are lucky to be here.

538
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:13,900
Just go out, tell the kids to vote,
do an interview with some MTV person

539
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,800
and we're outta here.

540
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:17,200
All right.

541
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:36,800
# Like stacks and stacks of rats on rafts

542
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:39,600
# Clutchin' anything we can

543
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:42,800
# Stacks and stacks of rats on rafts

544
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:46,100
# Weight of the world
crushin' our backs

545
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:48,400
# Tooth for a tooth

546
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:51,900
# Eye for an eye

547
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,900
# You know it's the truth

548
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:59,400
# And this is why

549
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:04,100
So he says "Rectum?
Damn near killed him!"

550
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:13,800
I love you guys.

551
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:15,800
This is fun.

552
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:20,900
So anyway, what you're saying,

553
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:24,200
I'm the Man, "Whitey",

554
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:32,400
and you guys are the victims of
a tyrannical, racist, oppressive society?

555
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:34,000
That's right, man.

556
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:36,400
Man, that sucks!

557
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,900
I'm gonna talk to some people
and straighten this out,

558
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:44,700
cos this is a bunch of bullcrap!

559
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:48,000
- All right?
- Yeah!

560
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,600
- I'm gonna go get 'em.
- Kick ass, Whitey!

561
00:44:57,300 --> 00:45:01,100
- So when do I go on?
- Six, seven minutes. Just relax.

562
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,500
- All right, all right.
- Straighten your tie.

563
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:06,400
- Should I lose the tie?
- Loosen the tie.

564
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:09,200
Just take it down. Take it down.

565
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:19,200
Yeah!

566
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:23,500
All right!

567
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:25,100
Whoo!

568
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:28,400
Yeah, man! I love you guys!

569
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:31,500
- Whoa, whoa. Hang on. All right.
- Excellent!

570
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:34,400
- What's your name?
- Mike Donnelly.

571
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:38,200
Governor Donnelly? Nice threads.

572
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:41,400
- No, you jag, he ain't the governor.
- He's runnin'for governor.

573
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:45,700
- Well, get on out there!
- No! No! You got the wrong guy.

574
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:48,100
Just a second. Fellas, come on.

575
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:57,700
Uh...

576
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:05,400
Um...

577
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:08,200
I'm not supposed to be here. Uh...

578
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:15,900
God. What is this?

579
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,400
l, uh...

580
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:24,100
I could sure use some cupcakes
or peanut-butter cups about now!

581
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,700
- (riotous cheering)
- Yeah!

582
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:30,600
- You know what that's about!
- (whoops of approval)

583
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:34,500
So I guess you guys should vote,
you know, because...

584
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:37,400
voting kicks ass, right? Yeah!

585
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:44,000
And let me tell you, if you're gonna vote,
why not vote for Al Donnelly, right?

586
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:46,200
(cheering)

587
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:50,700
(synchronised drumrolls)

588
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:56,900
Cos if voting kicks ass...

589
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:59,200
What in the hell...

590
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:01,000
Oh, please, God, I'm dreaming.

591
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:03,500
...you've got some kick-ass shit!

592
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:12,200
Oh, God. I'm a dead man. Oh!

593
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:15,400
I'm hyperventilating... Oh! Oh!

594
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:19,800
Cos I was born in the USA.

595
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,200
(shouts of "Yeah!")

596
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:30,800
You gotta fight for your right to vote.

597
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:44,500
That's one small step for man,
one giant...

598
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:48,300
- I have a dream!
- (cheering)

599
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:56,900
Power to the people!

600
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:03,800
<i>Burn,  baby,  burn!</i>

601
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:05,600
Oh, Mike!

602
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:09,400
Hey, fellas. Yeah.

603
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:12,100
Kill Whitey!

604
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:14,000
(stunned silence)

605
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:17,900
No! No! No!

606
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:25,500
- What in the hell were you thinking?
- I'm sorry. I just wanted to talk to you.

607
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:29,600
- Oh, yeah. "Sorry."
- And I don't know how it happened.

608
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:32,400
- I just got thrown on stage.
- Why couldn't you stay put?

609
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:35,500
I told you I would
take care of everything.

610
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:38,000
But, no, we get "Kill Whitey"?!

611
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:43,200
I can't believe I have to ask you this, but
are you trying to screw this up for me?

612
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:45,500
What is this? Do you want me to lose?

613
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:52,800
If I really thought you believed that,
I'd just... I'd wanna die.

614
00:48:57,300 --> 00:48:59,900
Just stay outta the way.

615
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:01,900
OK?

616
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:20,700
Are you or are you not
the Black Angel of Death?

617
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:23,200
Without question.

618
00:49:23,100 --> 00:49:25,900
Don't agree with me.
It just pisses me off more.

619
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:30,200
It's over. It's finished.

620
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:34,600
Talking about your brother's
election hopes or my career?

621
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:39,400
The person I care about
most in my life... hates me.

622
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:44,500
I'm not a brother.
I'm an embarrassment.

623
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:04,900
- So what do you wanna do today?
- I don't care. Whatever you want.

624
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,900
Man, I wish we could watch
your brother's debate on TV.

625
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:11,600
That's today? We gotta watch it.

626
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:14,500
How, by hooking a hanger up
to the metal plate in your head?

627
00:50:14,700 --> 00:50:18,500
I know a place with a TV. I saw it
when we were putting up posters.

628
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:20,700
It's not far from here. Let's go.

629
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:31,400
- Here it is.
- Of course. This had to be the place.

630
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:36,000
How could you have such horrible
instincts and survive this long?

631
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:40,400
- Looks like nobody's home.
- Yeah, I met this guy. Nobody is home.

632
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:42,800
Ooh!

633
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:44,100
Agh!

634
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:46,800
Run!

635
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:50,000
(Mike) Come on! Move it! Move it!

636
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,800
This guy's got
a hell of a security system.

637
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:59,500
Ready to start filming, Mr Stone.

638
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:02,100
Really.

639
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:07,300
My God, this guy is like Leatherface,
Chucky and Jan Brady rolled into one.

640
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:10,600
Eegh.

641
00:51:11,100 --> 00:51:14,300
(Mike) "Honourable discharge.
Drake Sabitch."

642
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:16,700
This must be his dad, Norris Sabitch.

643
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:22,300
And his Grandpappy Winston.

644
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:28,200
If he'd bought a smaller TV, he could've
afforded a couch with less urine on it.

645
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,900
Yeah.

646
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:36,500
<i>I want to see a Washington where
children can walk down streets safely, </i>

647
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:41,200
where people can leave doors unlocked
and their minds are free from fear.

648
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:45,100
This is one area where I'm in
total agreement with Governor Tracy.

649
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:47,400
<i>In fact,  I agreed with that statement</i>

650
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:51,100
when she made it in her first campaign
for governor eight years ago.

651
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:54,500
Man. My bro is knockin'
the snot outta her.

652
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:59,300
- I'm gonna go take a squeege.
- Watch your step.

653
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:17,900
<i>If you really wanna understand
Mr Donnelly's view on family values, </i>

654
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:21,500
take a look at his brother
and ask yourself this question:

655
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:24,400
"How far does
the acorn fall from the tree?"

656
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:26,800
Or should I say "nut"?

657
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:28,500
(laughter)

658
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:35,000
<i>Yes,  my brother has some problems,
but who doesn't?</i>

659
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:38,700
And I just wanna say
I love my brother Mike.

660
00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:42,000
And I am very proud of him.

661
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,600
And I believe that Mike's problems
are rather modest

662
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:49,700
when compared to the problems
facing our great state.

663
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:52,000
Those are the problems
I am interested in.

664
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:55,000
- (applause)
- Get her, Al.

665
00:52:56,300 --> 00:52:59,200
- (peeing)
- Ah. Ooh.

666
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:03,700
- Agh! Oh!
- You're in the wrong zone, soldier boy.

667
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:06,600
What the hell are you doin'
in my perimeter?

668
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:08,900
Um, sir, I'm not a soldier.

669
00:53:09,100 --> 00:53:12,900
And I don't know if you read in USA
Today last week, but the war is over.

670
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:16,700
You can punch out now,
move on, let it go.

671
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:19,700
Who told you that?

672
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:21,900
Charlie.

673
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:25,100
Um, I just talked to Charlie,
and he's not mad at you any more.

674
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:29,400
So let's call off Operation "One of us
is Crazy" and go our separate ways.

675
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:31,800
- Don't get smart with me!
- Ow.

676
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:34,100
Tell me who sent you on this mission,

677
00:53:34,100 --> 00:53:38,000
or I'm within my legal rights
to dispatch you with extreme prejudice.

678
00:53:37,900 --> 00:53:40,200
(pees and moans)

679
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:44,400
Sir, honestly, I just came back
to get my rental car and an apology.

680
00:53:44,300 --> 00:53:49,600
And if I could get that, I will gladly
leave your... coordinates here.

681
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:56,000
- Oh, the car?
- Uh-huh.

682
00:53:57,400 --> 00:54:00,000
- Is that all?
- (chuckles nervously) That's all.

683
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:09,500
Why didn't you tell me?

684
00:54:10,300 --> 00:54:14,100
- God! Here's the keys.
- Oh, thank you.

685
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:17,400
And here's my apology.

686
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:19,800
(pees)

687
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:24,500
I can splatter your cortex
or I can explode your heart.

688
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:28,000
- Which sounds quicker to you?
- (pees) That's a toughie.

689
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:31,200
Agh!

690
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:44,300
Whoo! Come on!

691
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:49,900
Nice moves.

692
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:53,200
I'm seriously impressed.

693
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:57,600
- Sergeant Drake Sabitch.
- Mike Donnelly. Nice to meet you.

694
00:54:57,500 --> 00:54:59,800
Nice to meet you.
I wanna show you something.

695
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:02,200
Drake, you ever watch
any Bruce Lee movies?

696
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:06,300
I got every one of 'em on laser disc.
Well, come in. Come in.

697
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:11,000
(# "Lady Marmalade" by LaBelle)

698
00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:20,300
That damned debate should've
never happened in the first place.

699
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:23,900
Donnelly had a smart-ass comment
to make after everything I said.

700
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:28,000
It doesn't matter. I can't wait to see the
look on his face when he goes down.

701
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:32,000
With all deference, Governor,
if he goes down.

702
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:36,700
It's all up to the voter turnout, which
our people think will be very high.

703
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:38,600
Well, it better be.

704
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:41,800
Or I'll have your balls
in a jar on my desk.

705
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:44,200
A very small jar.

706

avec moi ce soir?

707

# Voulez-vous coucher avec moi?

708
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:01,300
Are you getting sleepy?

709
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:05,400
Good night.

710
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:10,600
Take home, put in bed.

711
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:12,300
Good night, dear.

712
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:17,000
Oh, she's totally legal. I've got
all her papers and I pay all the taxes.

713
00:56:16,900 --> 00:56:19,400
Very good help, but "no speaka".

714
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:22,400
Who? What does he want?

715
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:24,900
Not sure, but he says
he thinks you'll like it.

716
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:26,500
Pardon me.

717
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:31,600
Governor Tracy, this is Mr...

718
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:33,900
Mr's fine.

719
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:42,300
So here's what went through my little
head. I got some pictures of your boys

720
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:45,600
setting the Pierce County
rec hall ablaze.

721
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:49,900
Or pictures that look like
Mike Donnelly set the fire.

722
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:52,400
I wait for election day to near.

723
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:57,500
Whoever's trailing... gives good money
for whichever picture does them best.

724
00:56:57,400 --> 00:57:00,400
My gut says I'm glad you're trailing.

725
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:03,400
Well, I'll have to see the pictures first.

726
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:20,400
You'll have to tell me your name, so I'll
know who to make out the cheque to.

727
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:22,900
My best friends call me "Cash".

728

- Shut up, Steve.

731
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:46,800
What could go wrong?
I vote, I go home.

732
00:57:46,700 --> 00:57:49,000
Over there.

733
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,300
- Did I make it?
- Yes.

734
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:54,700
- Name and address.
- Mike Donnelly. 612 Caswell Street.

Agh! I'm stuck in this thing.

Agh!

738
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:19,400
- Stop that!
- Oh, my God!

739
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:21,800
- Help!
- Are you crazy?

740
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,100
Get this thing off of me!

741
00:58:31,700 --> 00:58:33,800
- Agh!
- (women scream)

742
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:37,100
It's OK. It's OK, ma'am.

743
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:39,200
l, uh...

744
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:44,700
Here you go. I'm sorry.

745
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:48,300
Here you go, ma'am.
That is my fault entirely. I'm sorry.

746
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:49,900
Here you go.

747
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:57,200
Here you go, ma'am. OK. OK. I'm sorry.

748
00:58:57,100 --> 00:58:58,500
Oh!

749
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:01,200
You stupid jerk! What are you doing?!

750
00:59:20,300 --> 00:59:21,800
Who'd you vote for?

751

(TV on)

752
00:59:26,700 --> 00:59:29,500
I bet the exit polls
already have us by ten points.

shift in voter sentiment was expected, </i>

Recreation Centre fire.

757
00:59:41,700 --> 00:59:46,200
The arson accusations
came at the worst possible time

758
00:59:46,100 --> 00:59:49,600
for his brother Al Donnelly's drive
to the governor's mansion.

759
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:52,600
Governor Tracy
is about to claim victory...

760
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:54,700
It's all my fault.

761
00:59:54,700 --> 00:59:57,600
My brother lost his election
because of me.

762

- Cowlitz County. Tracy wins by 280.
- Oh!

01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:05,500
Garfield County.
Tracy: 1,048. Donnelly: 834.

764
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:08,600
Tracy won Garfield County?

765
01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:11,200
A lot of good our grass-roots
campaign did up there.

766
01:00:11,100 --> 01:00:14,300
1,048 to 834?

767
01:00:16,900 --> 01:00:20,600
That's 1,882 votes.

768
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:24,100
There's only 1,502 voters
up in Garfield County.

769
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:27,800
Somethin' isn't right.

770
01:00:27,900 --> 01:00:32,900
The Governor is going to campaign HQ
where she'll make her victory speech.

771
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:36,000
- They're the guys that started the fire.
- Those troopers?

772
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:39,300
They were wearing street clothes,
but that is them.

773
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:43,500
Steve, we gotta call Al now.

774
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:46,400
Wait a minute. I gotta do somethin' first.

775
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:08,800
Here it is. Voter registration
for Garfield County.

776
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:15,300
I knew it! Looky here.
Any of these names look familiar?

777
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:17,400
- You were right.
- Yeah.

778
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:21,600
Al didn't lose. He got cheated.
And we got proof right here.

779
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:25,000
- We get on the phone, alert the press.
- Screw that.

780
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:29,200
She embarrassed me in front of a state,
messed up things between me and Al.

781
01:01:29,100 --> 01:01:32,000
Now it's gonna be payback time.
Where can I find her?

782
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:35,800
There's a post-election ceremony
at the governor's mansion at 10am.

783
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:41,700
Nothing's gonna stop us now.

(engine dies)

786
01:01:51,300 --> 01:01:54,500
OK, maybe we could use some help.

787
01:01:56,100 --> 01:01:58,900
We'll meet you there.
We can't do this without you.

788
01:01:59,100 --> 01:02:02,900
You're a true American,
Sergeant Sabitch. I thank you. OK.

789
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:13,300
Robbie, this is the biggest thing I've
ever asked of you. You sure it's cool?

790
01:02:13,100 --> 01:02:14,600
No, it's not cool.

791
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:19,300
And if you get pulled over, I'll say the
car was stolen so I can keep my job.

792
01:02:19,300 --> 01:02:21,400
Oh, and one more thing.

793
01:02:23,100 --> 01:02:26,700
Do not use the tape deck
cos it's been shorting out on me.

794
01:02:28,300 --> 01:02:30,400
Don't forget.

We gotta be there at ten o'clock.

OK, people. Coming through.
Official police business.

I want you to step lively.
Do not make me abuse my power.

(amplified) These guys
think we're real cops!

806
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:45,400
- What the hell was that?
- A chunk in the road or something.

807
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:47,500
I just chunked in my pants.

808

Oh! Oh!

809
01:04:14,700 --> 01:04:19,200
- That bug just smacked the windshield.
- Oh, man. I'll get it. Here.

(burst of siren)

Where is the frickin' thing?

812
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:26,800
They got, like,
levers galore in this thing.

813

There it is.

814
01:04:29,500 --> 01:04:32,900
Man, that was weird. That bug was
comin' at me, we connected eyes.

815
01:04:32,800 --> 01:04:39,200
He was in slow motion going
"I can't stop! Don't wanna... Aiiesh!"

816
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,400
Oh, man, that was wild. It was so weird.

817
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:45,700
He was comin', just going "My life
is good. I'm alive, alive, alive... dead!"

818
01:04:45,700 --> 01:04:47,800
Oh.

819
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:49,900
This map is heavy.

820
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:52,800
It's got all those robes on it.

821
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:55,400
Rogues?

822
01:04:56,300 --> 01:04:58,300
Vroots?

823
01:04:58,200 --> 01:05:01,300
- How come I can't say that word?
- Roads.

824
01:05:05,500 --> 01:05:07,500
Row-ads.

825
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:09,500
Row-ads.

826
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:11,900
That's sort of a weird word, isn't it?

827
01:05:12,900 --> 01:05:15,000
That is a freaky word, man.

828
01:05:16,500 --> 01:05:18,600
Very, very freaky.

829
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:27,100
I'm stoned.

830
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:28,800
So are you.

831
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:31,100
Row-ads!

832
01:05:31,100 --> 01:05:35,200
Damn it! The nitrous oxide's
leaking into the car! Oh, man!

833
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:38,400
Oh, we gotta... we gotta maintain.

834
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:41,900
I think you just drive the speed limit,
we're gonna be cool.

835
01:05:41,900 --> 01:05:44,900
All right. It's cool.
I'll just go the speed limit.

836
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:46,800
- Limit. Limit.
- Limit.

837
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:49,200
- That's another freaky word.
- Limit.

838

- (siren)
- Did you turn the siren on?

839
01:05:52,300 --> 01:05:56,500
Dude, I can't even find the glove
compartment in this thing.

840
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:02,500
Oh, my God.

841
01:06:07,700 --> 01:06:09,700
Man, we're screwed.

842
01:06:09,900 --> 01:06:12,000
Get in the back!

843
01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:14,900
Get in there!

Transportin' a prisoner.
12th Precinct up in Buckley Town.

847
01:06:31,900 --> 01:06:35,200
My sarge gave me no overtime,
so I'm doing it lickety-split.

848
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:39,500
Tell me, Officer, do you have any idea
how fast you were going?

849
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:44,300
Well, I got a 426 hemi in her.

850
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:46,700
Three-quarter cams, nitro boosters.

851
01:06:46,700 --> 01:06:49,000
I can get her up to as good as 155.

852
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:53,200
Never do though, of course, unless
I'm chasing a cute chick in a Ferrari!

853
01:06:57,200 --> 01:07:00,400
I guess I was going about 65, tops.

854
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:03,600
Seven. Seven miles an hour.

855
01:07:03,500 --> 01:07:07,500
And normally when I stop people
they pull onto the shoulder.

856
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,300
I don't know how you
do things in Buckley,

857
01:07:12,300 --> 01:07:16,100
but down here we are protective
of the other drivers on the roads.

858
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:20,300
- Row-ads. Roods.
- Quiet back there!

859
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:23,300
I've taken enough guff from you
for one day. Raving psycho.

860
01:07:23,300 --> 01:07:26,300
Butchered 400 chickens
and screwed a beagle.

861
01:07:26,300 --> 01:07:30,300
Takin' him back to Nevada,
where he's wanted for bangin' horses.

862
01:07:32,600 --> 01:07:34,400
Good God!

863
01:07:34,300 --> 01:07:38,400
Then you get him through this state
a little faster than seven miles an hour,

864
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:40,000
Officer...

865
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:43,000
Uh, Meoff, Jack.

866
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:49,300
Go!

01:07:57,800 --> 01:08:00,700
- Oh, man!
- What a goon.

868
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:03,500
You were great though, man.
That was genius.

869
01:08:03,500 --> 01:08:06,300
I never would've thought of that.
That was hot.

Oh, man. I hope there's
enough juice left in these boosters.

01:08:18,900 --> 01:08:20,900

- Whoa!

874
01:08:20,900 --> 01:08:22,600
Whoo!

875
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:26,100
See ya.

876
01:08:26,100 --> 01:08:29,800
Oh, man! Whoo!

877
01:08:55,800 --> 01:08:57,800
We're live at the governor's mansion.

878
01:08:57,800 --> 01:09:02,000
Today is a celebration of Governor
Tracy's election to a third term,

879
01:09:02,300 --> 01:09:08,200
with all the campaign staff and their
families gathering for a festive affair.

880
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:12,600
Governor Tracy, having just pulled out
a squeaker, must be all smiles today.

881
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:17,800
<i>We're just receiving word
that Mike Donnelly,  brother of Al, </i>

883
01:09:20,200 --> 01:09:26,000
Mike Donnelly is driving down Capitol
Boulevard in a stolen police car.

884
01:09:25,700 --> 01:09:28,700
I don't believe this.
Driver, head back to the capital.

885
01:09:28,700 --> 01:09:31,600
- What? You can't do this.
- Do what?

886
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:33,500
Commit career suicide.

887
01:09:33,500 --> 01:09:37,300
I beg you, don't do this. Give me
some time. I can make you a senator.

888
01:09:37,300 --> 01:09:42,000
Jesus. Did it ever occur to you family
may be more important than career?

889
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:45,500
Ever occur to you that at some point
you'll have to make a choice

890
01:09:45,500 --> 01:09:47,800
between me and your loser brother?

891
01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:15,200
Go and scope it out.
Nobody's gonna recognise you.

892
01:10:15,100 --> 01:10:17,800
OK. Promise me you'll stay right here.

893
01:10:23,900 --> 01:10:26,400
Thank you. Thank you very much.

894
01:10:27,400 --> 01:10:31,300
This election was about
the majesty of democracy,

895
01:10:31,500 --> 01:10:35,300
where the gathered masses
held their vote high.

896
01:10:35,300 --> 01:10:37,000
(applause)

897
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:45,500
My re-election would not have been
possible without the people in this state

898
01:10:45,300 --> 01:10:47,900
who supported me in this victory.

899
01:10:47,900 --> 01:10:51,200
I must also thank
my wonderful husband Dennis

900
01:10:51,100 --> 01:10:54,400
and my two beautiful,
intelligent children...

901
01:10:54,300 --> 01:10:57,500
Psst! Steve. I'm in.

902
01:10:59,200 --> 01:11:02,100
Where the hell's Drake?
He's supposed to be here.

903
01:11:02,100 --> 01:11:06,200
I'm surprised we can't count on a guy
whose bus is surrounded by mines.

904
01:11:06,100 --> 01:11:08,200
All right. Here's what we do.

905
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:12,800
We dress as caterers, right?

906
01:11:12,900 --> 01:11:16,900
Nobody looks at a caterer's face.
It's always "Whaddaya got in the tray?"

907
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:20,100
Then we sneak around back.
When Tracy starts to...

908
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:23,600
Something's happening here.
Steve, help.

909
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:24,800
Steve.

910
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:26,800
Steve, get back here.

911
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:30,000
Oh, my God.
The damn thing's caught in my belt.

912
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,800
God! Help, please!

913
01:11:34,600 --> 01:11:36,600
- I can't...
- (gasps)

914
01:11:37,900 --> 01:11:39,400
I can't... God!

915
01:11:39,700 --> 01:11:42,100
- You in the band, help.
- Hello.

916
01:11:42,100 --> 01:11:44,000
Help!

917
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:46,100
God!

918
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,300
- Stay.
- Steve! Help.

919
01:11:49,300 --> 01:11:51,800
- How are you?
- Steve! Please!

920
01:11:51,800 --> 01:11:54,300
Somebody! Somebody help me.

921
01:11:54,300 --> 01:11:56,800
Somebody help me!

922
01:11:56,900 --> 01:11:59,700
Agh! Help!

923
01:12:01,200 --> 01:12:06,800
The voters have spoken, and I have
heard their message loud and clear.

924
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:09,300
- And that message is...
- (Mike) God! Help!

925
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:12,300
- Holy shit!
- (shocked gasps)

926
01:12:14,200 --> 01:12:16,500
(laughs nervously)

927
01:12:17,900 --> 01:12:20,400
Hi, there. Hi.

928
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:23,700
Boy, I feel like a horse's patoot.

929
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:27,300
l, uh...

930
01:12:27,300 --> 01:12:30,900
Oh, no! For the love of God!

931
01:12:31,700 --> 01:12:34,600
Aaaarrggh!

932
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:46,000
(groans)

933
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:49,000
I'm all right. I'm OK.

934
01:12:48,900 --> 01:12:51,500
Gimme a minute.
Gimme a minute. I'll be fine.

935
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:55,900
Nobody move, or Steve Dodds gets it!

936
01:12:55,700 --> 01:12:57,400
- Who?
- Steve Dodds.

937
01:12:57,500 --> 01:13:00,400
- Who's this guy?
- From the Donnelly campaign.

938
01:13:00,300 --> 01:13:03,100
What does it matter?
He's got a gun! You're a cop.

939
01:13:03,100 --> 01:13:06,900
Get over here. I'll kill him! I'll kill him!

940
01:13:06,900 --> 01:13:11,300
- I want that asshole taken out.
- I'll get a sharpshooter on it right away.

941
01:13:11,200 --> 01:13:14,400
- Get your ass up there.
- Ow!

942
01:13:14,300 --> 01:13:19,300
Everybody back up,
or I blow the pipsqueak's head off.

943
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:21,500
I've got somethin' to say!

944
01:13:21,500 --> 01:13:25,400
Please listen to him. Do what he says.
I have children. Tommy and Sally...

945
01:13:25,400 --> 01:13:26,800
- Shut up!
- All right.

946
01:13:27,100 --> 01:13:29,700
You keep your mouth shut, squirt.

947
01:13:29,700 --> 01:13:32,300
As soon as you get a clear shot, take it.

948
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:37,300
(Mike) OK, listen up.
This is serious business.

949
01:13:37,900 --> 01:13:43,000
Now, we've all been screwed
by Governor Tracy.

950
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:45,300
And now I'm gonna screw her!

951
01:13:45,200 --> 01:13:46,500
(shocked gasps)

952
01:13:46,600 --> 01:13:52,700
I mean, I have evidence here you need
to know about now before it's too late.

953
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:55,400
- Mike. Mike, what are you doing here?
- Oh, man.

954
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:59,400
- Isn't that Steve Dodds?
- Uh, yes, sir.

955
01:13:59,300 --> 01:14:03,300
Al, man, I know what I'm doin'.
I'm gonna prove you won the election.

956
01:14:03,200 --> 01:14:06,400
Mike, put the gun down.
There's other ways to handle this.

957
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:11,300
No, man! Al, there's no other way!
You gotta believe me.

958
01:14:11,200 --> 01:14:14,300
I believe you.
I just don't want you to get hurt.

959
01:14:14,700 --> 01:14:19,800
Look, I know this looks bad.
Al, man, I'm not a screwup on this one.

960
01:14:19,700 --> 01:14:22,400
I've got proof this time. Real proof.

961
01:14:23,300 --> 01:14:26,300
(Al) But the election's over. It's history.

962
01:14:26,300 --> 01:14:28,900
Like you're gonna be
if you don't put that gun down.

963
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:31,300
Al, please!

964
01:14:32,100 --> 01:14:36,000
If you love me like a brother,
you gotta back me up on this.

965
01:14:35,900 --> 01:14:39,600
All right, Mike. I'll back you up.
What do you want me to do?

966
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:41,900
Just let me explain what happened.

967
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:45,200
- Oh!
- (crowd scream)

968
01:14:45,700 --> 01:14:49,800
That's it. Game over.
I'm not even getting paid for this.

969
01:14:49,900 --> 01:14:53,300
- This is not worth it.
- Look out. Look out. Look out.

970
01:14:53,300 --> 01:14:55,200
OK.

971
01:14:55,900 --> 01:14:58,000
(crowd scream)

972
01:14:58,200 --> 01:15:02,700
Mr Thunder-maker here is gonna start
barkin' fire if you don't stop moving

973
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:05,200
and listen to what
this young man has to say.

974
01:15:05,800 --> 01:15:07,800
Go ahead, Mike. Clear.

975
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:12,800
Thank you, sir. You've just met Drake
Sabitch, a great American soldier.

976
01:15:12,700 --> 01:15:16,100
I'd like to tell you about
some other great American soldiers.

977
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,600
Drake Sabitch's grandfather,
Winston Sabitch,

978
01:15:18,500 --> 01:15:21,600
whose name you'll find
at the top of this list.

979
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:26,700
It says that he registered
and voted for Governor Tracy.

980
01:15:26,600 --> 01:15:29,800
- We're proud to have him as a voter.
- Hold your tongue, wench.

981
01:15:29,700 --> 01:15:34,000
The fact is Winston Sabitch was killed
in the Argonne Forest in 1918.

982
01:15:33,900 --> 01:15:38,200
A zeppelin landed on his head,
smashing his head clean out of his ass.

983
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:41,300
That's my granddad. Rest in pieces, sir.

984
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:46,100
Norris Sabitch met his maker
in Iwo Jima, 1944.

985
01:15:46,300 --> 01:15:51,000
Nelson Sabitch was killed
near the 38th Parallel in Korea.

986
01:15:50,900 --> 01:15:55,900
But yesterday these men managed
to cast their vote for Evelyn Tracy.

987
01:15:55,800 --> 01:15:58,300
(disapproving murmurs)

988
01:15:58,300 --> 01:16:00,800
You heard it here, folks. Voter fraud.

989
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:08,800
Half these people are buried in the
Garfield cemetery. That's one county.

990
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:13,500
- It's probably the same statewide.
- Hold on just a minute, young fellow.

991
01:16:13,400 --> 01:16:17,500
There's a perfectly good explanation
for all of this. Neuschwander.

992
01:16:18,200 --> 01:16:24,100
Actually, there is a perfectly
good explanation for this.

993
01:16:24,300 --> 01:16:27,300
- She put us up to it.
- Would you shut up?!

994
01:16:27,300 --> 01:16:29,100
- It's all her.
- Shut up!

995
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:35,800
Ladies and gentlemen,
this young man is a fine patriot.

996
01:16:35,700 --> 01:16:38,400
He deserves to be hoisted up
on our shoulders.

997
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:41,100
- Sergeant, please. This isn't necessary.
- Come on.

998
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,500
- Oh, you're a large American.
- Argh!

999
01:16:45,700 --> 01:16:47,600
Get off of me.

1000
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:52,200
My foot's caught a little bit.
I'm sorry. I beg your pardon.

1001
01:16:52,200 --> 01:16:56,400
- I'm asking you to get off me!
- Governor... I should say ex-governor!

1002
01:16:56,300 --> 01:16:59,200
I'm just trying to get
a little leverage on my foot.

1003
01:16:59,200 --> 01:17:01,100
Agh!

1004
01:17:03,400 --> 01:17:07,200
- No, no, no! Please, somebody help me!
- Oh, man.

1005
01:17:07,100 --> 01:17:09,200
(grunting)

1006
01:17:11,100 --> 01:17:15,400
- OK. Hi, how are ya?
- Somebody get him off of me!

1007
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
For God's sakes.

1008
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:19,900
(grunting continues)

1009
01:17:19,900 --> 01:17:22,800
Shut up! Shut up!

1010
01:17:28,100 --> 01:17:33,400
Thanks, bro. At times in the campaign
I lost sight of what really mattered.

1011
01:17:33,300 --> 01:17:36,900
- I never should have doubted you.
- Oh, thanks, man. It's cool.

1012
01:17:36,900 --> 01:17:39,300
Are you sure
you don't want a job on my staff?

1013
01:17:40,100 --> 01:17:44,200
You know what, Al? I don't think
I'm really cut out for politics.

1014
01:17:44,200 --> 01:17:47,000
Besides, I gotta rebuild that rec centre.

1015
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:49,800
- The kids really love the place, so...
- Yeah, I know.

1016
01:17:49,800 --> 01:17:53,800
Hey, I got somebody you gotta meet.
Scott, come here a second.

1017
01:17:56,200 --> 01:17:59,700
Check this kid out. He's got an arm
like you used to have. Hey, Scott.

1018
01:17:59,700 --> 01:18:02,900
Hey. Mr Governor,
can I please have your autograph?

1019
01:18:02,900 --> 01:18:05,600
Why not? Governor elect.

1020
01:18:05,700 --> 01:18:07,600
Get it right, moron.

1021
01:18:09,100 --> 01:18:10,600
- There you go.
- Wow.

1022
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:13,700
Check this out.
Gimme a toss, Scott. Hey, buddy.

1023
01:18:13,700 --> 01:18:15,600
Ooh!

1024
01:18:15,500 --> 01:18:19,300
Nice toss, Scott.
Oh, man, the kid's got a cannon.

1025
01:18:19,200 --> 01:18:21,400
- Go long.
- OK.

1026
01:18:22,100 --> 01:18:24,100
- Ow!
- Oh!

1027
01:18:24,100 --> 01:18:26,600
- I'm sorry, ma'am.
- You OK?

1028
01:18:32,700 --> 01:18:35,500
- So long, little brother.
- OK. See you, Al.

1029
01:18:38,100 --> 01:18:42,300
- So this is it, huh, Steve?
- I guess I'm gonna miss you.

1030
01:18:42,300 --> 01:18:46,100
I'm not gonna miss a 9mm to my head,
but... What were you thinking?

1031
01:18:45,900 --> 01:18:48,200
I don't know.

1032
01:18:52,100 --> 01:18:55,600
All right, you guys.
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

1033
01:19:00,600 --> 01:19:03,900
Oh, my God! No! No!

1034
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:05,900
Please don't take off!

1035
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:07,800
Please!

1036
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:10,200
Al! Al! No! No!

1037
01:19:10,200 --> 01:19:12,300
(Mike screaming)

1038
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:38,600
