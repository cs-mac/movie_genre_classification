1
00:00:27,594 --> 00:00:28,356
These are gonna be great

2
00:00:28,595 --> 00:00:30,654
Can you imagine if your wife
ever found these?

3
00:00:45,412 --> 00:00:47,073
Crys, come on

4
00:00:47,481 --> 00:00:48,971
Put down the camera

5
00:00:49,349 --> 00:00:50,873
This is such good shit

6
00:00:53,921 --> 00:00:55,286
Come on, Crys

7
00:00:55,823 --> 00:00:57,290
Crys, come on...

8
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:01,337
What do I look like to you,
a '"Playboy'" bunny?

9
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:05,974
You're not gonna come and
take pictures...

10
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:16,993
and let me take the picture

11
00:03:17,164 --> 00:03:19,928
I'm gonna fill up the whole scrapbook

12
00:03:28,976 --> 00:03:31,968
Peisha, this is the most fun

13
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:33,941
Peisha!

14
00:03:38,118 --> 00:03:39,517
Oh, shit

15
00:03:40,287 --> 00:03:41,447
Fuck

16
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:43,320
Crys

17
00:03:43,523 --> 00:03:45,548
Ow! Fuck!

18
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,394
Crys, Crys

19
00:03:51,498 --> 00:03:52,590
What's wrong with him?

20
00:03:52,766 --> 00:03:54,324
Shit

21
00:03:55,302 --> 00:03:57,702
What's wrong, Crys? What happened?

22
00:04:17,124 --> 00:04:18,523
Jesus Christ

23
00:04:20,193 --> 00:04:22,127
Don't look at us, it was his shit

24
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:23,793
Are you sure he's dead?

25
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:30,664
Take the girls to the club

26
00:04:31,805 --> 00:04:32,999
I got to call his people

27
00:04:36,977 --> 00:04:39,571
I can't believe I voted for this asshole

28
00:04:40,547 --> 00:04:42,447
It's not about winning ball games

29
00:04:42,682 --> 00:04:44,013
It's about emotion

30
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:45,576
You know what that is?

31
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,177
Emotion?

32
00:04:47,554 --> 00:04:52,253
The Lakers are not the Lakers
without Rambis

33
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:55,992
He was the spark, the inspiration

34
00:04:56,196 --> 00:04:57,094
He was white

35
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:58,491
I didn't say that

36
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:04,030
But did it ever occur to you that's why
they let him go?

37
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:04,999
Rambis left on his own

38
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:06,294
Is that a brew in that bag?

39
00:05:06,606 --> 00:05:07,095
On his own?

40
00:05:07,274 --> 00:05:08,206
Yeah, on his own, read the paper

41
00:05:08,442 --> 00:05:09,670
Oh, come on!

42
00:05:09,943 --> 00:05:11,774
Christ, Moony, we're on duty...

43
00:05:11,945 --> 00:05:15,506
and that shit you're eating is
sixty percent grease

44
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:19,509
He's got one

45
00:05:19,753 --> 00:05:22,313
Dillnick? I don't believe it

46
00:05:28,962 --> 00:05:32,056
Miss? Excuse me, miss

47
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:35,160
You talking to me, Elvis?

48
00:05:42,142 --> 00:05:43,200
Oh, shit

49
00:05:44,111 --> 00:05:45,601
What kind of action you looking for?

50
00:05:46,246 --> 00:05:49,044
I was kind of hoping you could tell me

51
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:51,708
Translation, he doesn't know

52
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:54,549
Now she's gonna stick her balloons
through the window

53
00:05:54,754 --> 00:05:56,381
Magic fingers are twenty

54
00:05:56,957 --> 00:05:59,187
Fifty puts the pig in the blanket

55
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,324
You want something oral,
see you dentist

56
00:06:05,499 --> 00:06:07,490
Did you see what he was
wearing tonight?

57
00:06:07,968 --> 00:06:09,970
He wasn't wearing that striped thing,
was he?

58
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:11,369
So, what?

59
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:12,799
Looking for something kinky?

60
00:06:13,006 --> 00:06:14,303
Want to hear the chef's special?

61
00:06:14,508 --> 00:06:19,036
No, I'm sure whatever you do will be fine

62
00:06:25,018 --> 00:06:26,542
Hope you have lots of raincoats...

63
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:28,583
because I don't ride bareback anymore

64
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:33,658
We're meeting him at the Bowl?

65
00:06:33,827 --> 00:06:35,454
Yeah, sounds like we better hurry

66
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:37,526
Nice jacket

67
00:06:37,764 --> 00:06:39,322
Seersucker makes me hot

68
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:41,325
Just relax

69
00:06:41,801 --> 00:06:43,234
Just let me take control

70
00:06:43,436 --> 00:06:44,334
You'll love it, believe me

71
00:06:45,272 --> 00:06:46,330
Stone

72
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:48,374
Come on, Moon, forget him

73
00:06:48,608 --> 00:06:51,236
We got to meet Dill, Moon,
leave him alone

74
00:06:54,314 --> 00:06:56,179
Ah, Jesus

75
00:06:56,483 --> 00:06:58,246
Promotions are next week

76
00:06:58,451 --> 00:06:59,418
He's speeding

77
00:07:01,121 --> 00:07:03,385
Being a cop's like being a pitcher, Harry

78
00:07:03,623 --> 00:07:05,750
To hit the strikes, you've got to...

79
00:07:06,026 --> 00:07:08,494
Risk your balls, for what, Moon?
What is this?

80
00:07:08,728 --> 00:07:10,320
This is initiative, I'm showing initiative

81
00:07:10,564 --> 00:07:11,656
No, this is harassment

82
00:07:11,831 --> 00:07:13,890
There is something very perverse
about you and this Stone

83
00:07:14,034 --> 00:07:15,262
Perverse? Yeah, perverse

84
00:07:15,502 --> 00:07:16,662
It wasn't his fault she left you

85
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:17,666
Yeah? Yeah

86
00:07:17,837 --> 00:07:18,735
Bullshit!

87
00:07:19,873 --> 00:07:21,670
Hollywood, this is seven-one

88
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:25,208
Dillnick is making a Redi-Whip delivery
to the parking lot at the Bowl

89
00:07:25,412 --> 00:07:27,573
Can somebody take her off his hands?
Thanks

90
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:30,014
Tell them to take their time

91
00:07:38,158 --> 00:07:39,682
Phil, can you get the champagne?

92
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:43,486
Have a staff member find his body
in the morning

93
00:07:44,764 --> 00:07:46,561
Police can notify his wife

94
00:07:47,234 --> 00:07:49,429
Washington wants full damage control

95
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:50,567
Understand?

96
00:07:51,338 --> 00:07:53,033
Sure you can handle these girls?

97
00:07:53,273 --> 00:07:54,262
It's my business

98
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:55,736
It's your business if you don't

99
00:07:58,211 --> 00:07:59,269
Graham

100
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:13,088
This is out of our league, Jack

101
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,591
It's also out of our jurisdiction

102
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:16,625
Come on, we're in Beverly Hills

103
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:17,797
Nice suit

104
00:08:31,044 --> 00:08:32,477
It's OK, it's OK

105
00:08:32,712 --> 00:08:34,771
He's just picking up her and
her girlfriend

106
00:08:34,914 --> 00:08:35,642
He's their lawyer

107
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:37,146
They don't look safe to drive

108
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:38,613
Get lost, pal

109
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:39,517
Getting strange

110
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:41,448
Be cool, now

111
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:42,712
What? I didn't say anything

112
00:08:44,124 --> 00:08:48,117
Stone! Somebody's calling you

113
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:49,459
Stone!

114
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:51,925
What?! What, what, what?

115
00:08:57,771 --> 00:08:58,795
Zara, come on!

116
00:08:58,938 --> 00:08:59,700
What the hell are you doing?

117
00:08:59,906 --> 00:09:00,531
You out of your mind?

118
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:02,368
Move over! I'm gonna drive

119
00:09:06,446 --> 00:09:07,174
You said you were gonna...

120
00:09:07,514 --> 00:09:08,811
You said you were gonna quit

121
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,753
I want a promotion, Moon,
not a goddamn suspension

122
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:17,753
He's running, Harry

123
00:09:17,957 --> 00:09:19,015
Well, you shot at him!

124
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:21,489
He's dirty I know he's dirty!

125
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:24,489
I'm finally gonna nail his black ass
to the wall

126
00:09:25,265 --> 00:09:26,289
If you have any drugs in your purse...

127
00:09:26,533 --> 00:09:29,195
would you please just throw them
out the window?

128
00:09:29,869 --> 00:09:30,801
I don't believe...

129
00:09:31,037 --> 00:09:32,436
You know, I could be disbarred
for this shit

130
00:09:36,976 --> 00:09:37,772
Leon!

131
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:40,611
Give me the purse...

132
00:09:45,352 --> 00:09:46,785
Hold the girls and get some backup

133
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:47,680
Oh, Moon

134
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:52,388
Ah, Jesus

135
00:09:55,028 --> 00:09:56,154
Stay put

136
00:10:45,445 --> 00:10:46,469
Stone!

137
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:53,015
Move

138
00:10:53,253 --> 00:10:54,345
Fuck

139
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,396
Well, it's about time

140
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:42,969
Now, look, I'm a lawyer, all right?

141
00:11:42,969 --> 00:11:46,166
And this is a clear-cut case
of harassment

142
00:11:46,406 --> 00:11:49,204
Now, for the past six months
this poor excuse for a police off...

143
00:11:56,082 --> 00:11:58,607
Are you gentlemen gonna keep this
mad dog off me, or what?

144
00:12:03,323 --> 00:12:04,085
Thank you

145
00:12:06,493 --> 00:12:07,425
All right, look...

146
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,255
I don't know what the problem
you have with...

147
00:12:09,462 --> 00:12:10,724
Jesus, what the hell have you
been eating?

148
00:12:12,165 --> 00:12:13,723
Your ass, nigger

149
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:20,335
You called him the '"n'" word?

150
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:24,535
You left Dillnick with a car date
at the Hollywood Bowl...

151
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:27,611
fired your weapon without cause
at a private club...

152
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:30,112
participated in a high-speed car chase...

153
00:12:30,316 --> 00:12:33,114
then you decked a black lawyer in front
of a hundred people...

154
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:35,150
and called him the '"n'" word?

155
00:12:35,388 --> 00:12:36,548
I made the arrest

156
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:41,856
You made squat, Moony...

157
00:12:42,128 --> 00:12:45,393
and I am sick and tired of your
street cowboy attitude...

158
00:12:45,632 --> 00:12:47,361
and your racist bullshit

159
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,195
But let me try and get through to you,
Moony

160
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:54,929
There are those of us who can say
the '"n'" word...

161
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:58,043
and there are those of us who cannot

162
00:13:00,146 --> 00:13:02,080
Now, I can say the '"n'" word

163
00:13:02,348 --> 00:13:03,872
Nigger, nigger, nigger, nigger, nigger

164
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:05,812
See, I can say the damn word all I want...

165
00:13:06,085 --> 00:13:06,881
but your can't

166
00:13:07,053 --> 00:13:10,489
In fact, Moony, if I catch your
little perverse, bigoted...

167
00:13:10,823 --> 00:13:11,915
bullshit mouth saying it again...

168
00:13:12,091 --> 00:13:14,753
I'm going to personally tear you out
a new asshole

169
00:13:18,998 --> 00:13:21,762
Is this going to affect my...

170
00:13:23,102 --> 00:13:25,002
promotion evaluation?

171
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:26,596
Promotion?

172
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:40,709
You are suspended, Sergeant

173
00:13:41,387 --> 00:13:44,914
Leave your piece and your shield
with Rinselle on the way out of here

174
00:13:48,361 --> 00:13:50,625
Called him the '"n'" word and
want a promotion

175
00:13:54,634 --> 00:13:55,658
Sorry, Moon

176
00:14:06,946 --> 00:14:07,844
Did you do it?

177
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:34,363
Moon?

178
00:14:56,529 --> 00:14:57,723
You doing OK?

179
00:15:01,968 --> 00:15:03,526
You don't look so good

180
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:05,261
Thank you

181
00:15:06,706 --> 00:15:08,503
What was this all about tonight?

182
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,368
Is he pimping for you now?

183
00:15:11,844 --> 00:15:14,039
I don't deserve that, Moon

184
00:15:14,847 --> 00:15:15,711
Neither does he

185
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,041
What were you doing?

186
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:24,318
I didn't tell you I finished night school
finally...

187
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:26,958
and I got my application into
Valley Arts College...

188
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,386
and I saved up all the tuition...

189
00:15:28,561 --> 00:15:29,528
What?

190
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:36,659
I don't know why I keep forgetting
to drop this off

191
00:15:40,206 --> 00:15:44,040
Every time I'm near your house,
it's not the right time

192
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:57,381
Jesus Christ!

193
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:58,887
Why do you have to keep doing that?

194
00:15:59,092 --> 00:16:00,559
I need it For what?

195
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:01,919
Self-defense

196
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:03,284
From what?

197
00:16:04,397 --> 00:16:05,864
Why do you carry a gun?

198
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:07,154
I'm a cop!

199
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:09,526
Yeah, well, I'm not

200
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,869
Do you still have the fishbowl?

201
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:12,696
Yeah

202
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:15,467
Can you just put this in there
with the others?

203
00:16:15,675 --> 00:16:17,643
And, like, if something happens to me...

204
00:16:17,877 --> 00:16:18,605
have them print it up

205
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:21,279
You know, like, sprinkle them
over Hollywood Boulevard like ashes

206
00:16:32,024 --> 00:16:34,185
Coming? Yeah

207
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:41,291
Crys

208
00:16:44,604 --> 00:16:45,662
Bye, Moon

209
00:17:28,147 --> 00:17:29,876
Because I love you so

210
00:17:42,862 --> 00:17:44,989
Come here, here you go

211
00:17:45,164 --> 00:17:46,028
Come on now

212
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,831
That's yours, yeah, that's yours

213
00:17:50,036 --> 00:17:52,630
OK, you can have some of that, too,
all right?

214
00:17:52,839 --> 00:17:53,931
Hey, come here

215
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:54,835
Look at that

216
00:17:55,007 --> 00:17:56,235
Come out of here

217
00:17:56,776 --> 00:17:57,572
There you go

218
00:17:59,478 --> 00:18:00,672
You want some of this?

219
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:02,208
Just a bit

220
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:03,646
There you go

221
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:06,216
Yeah, I know, glad to see you, too

222
00:18:06,953 --> 00:18:08,580
Get out of here, will you?

223
00:18:09,856 --> 00:18:11,255
I'm trying to give you stuff you like

224
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:14,188
Get out, what's the matter with you?

225
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:19,356
That's it, Chuck, you don't get any more

226
00:18:23,236 --> 00:18:24,703
Well, maybe just a...

227
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:42,310
just a little more

228
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:08,710
Chuck!

229
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:26,563
What are you saying?

230
00:19:26,966 --> 00:19:28,900
That's it? He's dead?

231
00:19:29,769 --> 00:19:33,170
He will be without a new heart...

232
00:19:33,806 --> 00:19:36,008
and the odds of finding a
B-positive donor...

233
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:36,940
Dr. Posner

234
00:19:37,143 --> 00:19:38,041
Excuse me

235
00:19:43,215 --> 00:19:44,182
He was a cop?

236
00:19:45,251 --> 00:19:46,218
Yeah, vice

237
00:19:46,419 --> 00:19:48,410
How the hell did he get in that kind
of condition?

238
00:19:49,889 --> 00:19:50,856
Vice

239
00:19:51,657 --> 00:19:54,217
Sad news for the State of California
and the nation

240
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,289
Senator James Marquand...

241
00:19:56,495 --> 00:19:58,929
one of the most respected leaders
on Capitol Hill...

242
00:19:59,065 --> 00:20:01,295
is dead at fifty four

243
00:20:01,467 --> 00:20:04,197
Found by a staff member in his
Bel Air home this morning...

244
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:06,736
the author of the new anti-drug
legislation...

245
00:20:06,906 --> 00:20:09,466
is believed to have died from
heart failure

246
00:20:09,675 --> 00:20:13,111
The President described Marquand
as a true gentleman...

247
00:20:13,312 --> 00:20:15,041
a brilliant statesman...

248
00:20:15,614 --> 00:20:17,946
OK, which one of you guys said
the Hail Mary?

249
00:20:19,318 --> 00:20:20,376
The donor's condition?

250
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:21,520
It was a car accident...

251
00:20:21,687 --> 00:20:23,120
severe trauma to the head and
lower back...

252
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:24,252
severed brainstem

253
00:20:24,423 --> 00:20:25,390
Otherwise, the guy's a cream puff

254
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:26,558
His form's in order?

255
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:27,418
We got him on file

256
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:28,991
He had it marked on his license

257
00:20:32,198 --> 00:20:33,392
Anything medical?

258
00:20:34,533 --> 00:20:37,297
This guy's squeaky clean about
everything but his occupation

259
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:39,203
Pusher? Close

260
00:20:39,372 --> 00:20:40,964
Proctologist? Getting warmer

261
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,639
Don't tell me he's a lawyer

262
00:20:43,342 --> 00:20:44,639
But don't sweat malpractice

263
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:45,968
He's too dead to sue

264
00:20:58,724 --> 00:20:59,588
Shit, turn that down

265
00:20:59,859 --> 00:21:00,655
I got it

266
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:01,884
OK, he's asleep, come on, come on

267
00:21:02,128 --> 00:21:02,753
You sure he knows?

268
00:21:03,062 --> 00:21:04,051
It's only been a few weeks

269
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:05,594
Yeah, the doctor told him yesterday

270
00:21:05,798 --> 00:21:06,628
Everything, right?

271
00:21:06,732 --> 00:21:08,393
Yeah, everything, now will you come on?

272
00:21:08,634 --> 00:21:09,100
You got it on him?

273
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:10,166
It won't stand up

274
00:21:10,403 --> 00:21:10,835
Well, them, prop it up

275
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:12,870
You sure he knows, Harry?

276
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:14,595
He knows, he knows

277
00:21:14,874 --> 00:21:15,806
Harry?

278
00:21:16,342 --> 00:21:18,173
One, two, three, four...

279
00:21:18,344 --> 00:21:20,107
Can't get enough of you, babe...

280
00:21:20,312 --> 00:21:21,711
Can't get enough of you...

281
00:21:21,914 --> 00:21:22,539
Ooh, darling...

282
00:21:22,815 --> 00:21:24,248
Can't get enough of you...

283
00:21:24,517 --> 00:21:26,747
Can't get enough of you, babe...

284
00:21:27,053 --> 00:21:29,886
Can't get enough of you...

285
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:31,987
All I want is you, babe...

286
00:21:32,258 --> 00:21:33,623
Don't you know it's true?

287
00:21:33,926 --> 00:21:35,325
What the fuck is this?

288
00:21:36,695 --> 00:21:37,491
Oh, shit

289
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:38,828
He doesn't know

290
00:21:39,765 --> 00:21:41,528
Moony, stop! Come back here! Mo...

291
00:21:42,068 --> 00:21:43,695
Posner said he was gonna tell you,
Moon

292
00:21:43,903 --> 00:21:44,801
We didn't know

293
00:21:48,474 --> 00:21:50,999
Jack, what do you think you're doing
out of bed?

294
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:52,006
You put it in

295
00:21:52,244 --> 00:21:53,336
Now you take it out!

296
00:21:55,948 --> 00:21:57,575
Want to tell me where he had it?

297
00:22:03,055 --> 00:22:04,818
I want you to exercise, Jack...

298
00:22:05,424 --> 00:22:07,016
or you can throw these ten months
of rehab...

299
00:22:07,226 --> 00:22:09,285
out the window, understand?

300
00:22:10,362 --> 00:22:14,731
No drinking, no smoking, no fatty foods

301
00:22:14,934 --> 00:22:16,925
No more roundups, no more drug busts...

302
00:22:17,203 --> 00:22:19,398
no more asinine car chases

303
00:22:19,872 --> 00:22:23,501
You're a desk sergeant now,
a career paper jock

304
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:25,008
You got it?

305
00:22:25,511 --> 00:22:27,741
Yeah, I got it

306
00:22:31,317 --> 00:22:32,750
I didn't want to take you back, Moony

307
00:22:33,052 --> 00:22:34,314
Central made me

308
00:22:35,821 --> 00:22:38,051
Just because we got the same
color heart...

309
00:22:38,624 --> 00:22:40,057
don't go thinking we're blood

310
00:22:47,333 --> 00:22:49,426
Hey, Moony, starting to walk with
a little rhythm

311
00:22:49,635 --> 00:22:50,499
Funny

312
00:22:50,703 --> 00:22:51,601
Hey, Moondog...

313
00:22:51,837 --> 00:22:52,929
Nice tan, Moony

314
00:22:53,472 --> 00:22:55,337
They say the heart's not the only new
equipment you got

315
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:56,439
You wish

316
00:22:58,644 --> 00:22:59,770
Terri...

317
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:03,071
did you ever locate Crystal Gerrity?

318
00:23:03,349 --> 00:23:05,749
She's the carrot top Detective Zara
was checking out

319
00:23:06,252 --> 00:23:07,412
Detective Zara?

320
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:10,048
Yeah, Harry, she's a hooker, right?

321
00:23:10,523 --> 00:23:11,615
Yeah

322
00:23:11,991 --> 00:23:16,485
He said she'd picked up a couple of
speeding tickets out near Malibu

323
00:23:16,595 --> 00:23:18,119
Right, about six months ago

324
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:20,389
The addresses she gave on both
citations were phony

325
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:22,157
Zip on the Peisha chick, too

326
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:23,995
They're out there, but nobody
knows where

327
00:23:24,203 --> 00:23:26,535
Could you run it through the machine
for me again?

328
00:23:27,139 --> 00:23:29,733
Well, anything's possible for a little
of your honey

329
00:23:30,576 --> 00:23:32,066
You got a dirty mind

330
00:23:32,678 --> 00:23:33,736
See you

331
00:23:43,489 --> 00:23:45,923
Now, that was all Harry's idea, Jack

332
00:23:50,963 --> 00:23:55,627
If he's gonna ride with you, you got to
get him to get rid of those stripes

333
00:23:55,935 --> 00:23:59,132
Ever since that night at the Bowl
he thinks that that's his lucky jacket

334
00:23:59,805 --> 00:24:00,737
Shit

335
00:24:08,314 --> 00:24:11,647
Well, we got to go

336
00:24:11,917 --> 00:24:13,908
Yeah, go

337
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:14,983
Later

338
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:16,379
Yeah, Harry

339
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:19,184
Let me see your shield

340
00:24:20,659 --> 00:24:21,523
Come on

341
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:31,291
Looks nice

342
00:24:32,438 --> 00:24:33,735
Looks real good on you

343
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:35,371
Thanks

344
00:25:23,789 --> 00:25:24,721
Keep the change

345
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:25,720
Thanks

346
00:26:09,134 --> 00:26:10,465
Don't eat that

347
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:12,568
Clogs the arteries

348
00:26:12,871 --> 00:26:13,929
It makes your breath stink

349
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,532
Listen, ass...

350
00:26:18,744 --> 00:26:19,642
Trust me

351
00:26:24,049 --> 00:26:25,380
Now, look, look

352
00:26:26,085 --> 00:26:28,952
I wasn't even gonna say anything,
you know

353
00:26:29,154 --> 00:26:30,553
I tried to give you a chance to get into
the groove...

354
00:26:30,789 --> 00:26:32,154
and as bad as those Camels are...

355
00:26:32,358 --> 00:26:34,053
I was more than willing to let a few of
those go by...

356
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:37,956
but when you start shoving this dog
meat into your face...

357
00:26:38,197 --> 00:26:39,391
I'm sorry, I just have to step in

358
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:41,122
I have to do something, now put it down

359
00:26:41,867 --> 00:26:43,334
Put it down

360
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:45,930
Moony, put it down

361
00:26:46,105 --> 00:26:47,834
Put it down

362
00:26:49,675 --> 00:26:50,471
Didn't you listen to the doctor?

363
00:26:50,776 --> 00:26:51,970
Don't you know what this shit does
to your heart?

364
00:26:52,311 --> 00:26:54,176
Moony, look, you're looking very
stupid now

365
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:56,348
You are dancing with a cheeseburger

366
00:27:03,789 --> 00:27:05,620
We can do this all day, OK?

367
00:27:05,824 --> 00:27:07,223
But you look real silly...

368
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:09,852
dancing around with a cheeseburger

369
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:13,230
The only person that can see me is you

370
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:15,660
What's up with that guy?

371
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:49,433
You know, you can't get away from me

372
00:27:51,904 --> 00:27:53,895
This is a very good-looking car

373
00:27:54,072 --> 00:27:56,165
I mean, this is absolutely fabulous

374
00:27:56,809 --> 00:27:58,037
Has it ever been washed?

375
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,612
It's weird, I know, it's very weird

376
00:28:09,888 --> 00:28:10,877
I'm not even used to it myself

377
00:28:11,089 --> 00:28:12,283
It's kind of like that out-of-body...

378
00:28:12,491 --> 00:28:15,892
you know, astral-projection,
Shirley Maclaine thing

379
00:28:16,094 --> 00:28:16,992
I mean, one minute...

380
00:28:17,229 --> 00:28:19,595
I'm sitting in the front seat of my car,
and I'm dying

381
00:28:19,798 --> 00:28:20,992
Next time I know... boom!

382
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,862
I'm standing in the operating room
looking at myself...

383
00:28:24,169 --> 00:28:26,660
while they're pulling my heart out of me

384
00:28:26,839 --> 00:28:28,466
I mean, it was like that...
What's the name of that movie?

385
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,767
Oh, this is very good, this is good

386
00:28:31,043 --> 00:28:33,876
Going back and forth is good because
it stimulates the heart

387
00:28:34,346 --> 00:28:35,244
It makes you a lot strong...

388
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:36,605
Are you listening to me?

389
00:28:36,949 --> 00:28:37,574
You are listening to me?

390
00:28:37,783 --> 00:28:39,774
Hey, wait a minute
You're ignoring me, aren't you?

391
00:28:39,985 --> 00:28:41,247
Now, listen, I didn't want my heart in you...

392
00:28:41,487 --> 00:28:43,045
any more than you wanted my heart
in you...

393
00:28:43,255 --> 00:28:44,722
and if I knew that my heart was
gonna be...

394
00:28:44,957 --> 00:28:46,891
inside a piece of racist scum like you...

395
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:48,524
I never would've donated it in the
first place

396
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:50,991
But that's OK, you know,
because life's a bitch...

397
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:52,527
and then you die, you know?

398
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:54,858
It's true, isn't it?

399
00:28:56,001 --> 00:28:57,400
Hey...

400
00:28:57,669 --> 00:29:00,502
but I didn't die! I was murdered!

401
00:29:04,776 --> 00:29:08,234
I didn't get a real good look...
if it was a Cutlass Sierra or a...

402
00:29:08,514 --> 00:29:10,846
but I did get a real good look
at the driver...

403
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:12,015
right before he ran me off the road

404
00:29:12,317 --> 00:29:12,715
Hey, Moony, you OK?

405
00:29:12,951 --> 00:29:13,440
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine

406
00:29:13,719 --> 00:29:14,686
Aren't you gonna... Wait a minute!

407
00:29:14,987 --> 00:29:16,181
Aren't you gonna talk to me?

408
00:29:16,321 --> 00:29:18,721
I thought you said you wanted to
be a detective, huh?

409
00:29:18,857 --> 00:29:20,586
I thought you said you wanted
that gold shield?

410
00:29:20,826 --> 00:29:22,487
Well, this is your opportunity, this is it

411
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:24,058
Now are you gonna talk to me,
or aren't you?

412
00:29:24,263 --> 00:29:25,287
No!

413
00:29:36,408 --> 00:29:39,639
I'm gonna prescribe a little medication,
Jack

414
00:29:40,913 --> 00:29:42,073
Nothing serious

415
00:29:42,915 --> 00:29:44,974
Just something to calm your nerves...

416
00:29:45,517 --> 00:29:47,041
help the hallucinations

417
00:29:48,287 --> 00:29:50,118
I take these every once in a while...

418
00:29:50,322 --> 00:29:51,983
hoping my wife will disappear

419
00:29:53,425 --> 00:29:56,019
But you mean that this is a normal thing?

420
00:29:56,261 --> 00:29:57,250
Oh, sure it is

421
00:29:57,763 --> 00:29:59,458
This could be perfectly normal

422
00:30:00,198 --> 00:30:02,666
A psycho-chemical aberration
of some kind

423
00:30:02,868 --> 00:30:03,857
We're just beginning to learn...

424
00:30:04,102 --> 00:30:06,969
how transplants affect the human body
and mind

425
00:30:10,542 --> 00:30:12,442
Take a couple of days off

426
00:30:12,678 --> 00:30:13,872
You'll feel much better

427
00:30:21,587 --> 00:30:23,316
Is that tranquilizer working yet?

428
00:30:25,724 --> 00:30:29,194
Say yes, you want to wind up in
a mental institution?

429
00:30:29,194 --> 00:30:31,628
Jack? Yes!

430
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:34,364
Yeah, it's working fine

431
00:30:34,766 --> 00:30:35,664
It's OK

432
00:30:47,913 --> 00:30:49,813
Jesus! Chuck!

433
00:31:08,033 --> 00:31:12,060
Personally, I think that this racism
this refusal to acknowledge me...

434
00:31:12,371 --> 00:31:14,100
stems from feelings of inadequacy

435
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,039
I mean, you look at me
What do you see?

436
00:31:16,174 --> 00:31:18,165
Someone college-educated,
damn good-looking...

437
00:31:18,377 --> 00:31:21,369
hung like a Shetland pony,
and you feel threatened

438
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:23,272
Am I hitting a nerve?

439
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:26,017
Come on, Chuck

440
00:31:26,118 --> 00:31:28,814
Oh, I see, you can talk to the cat,
but you can't talk to me

441
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:32,747
Get out of the way, Shithead

442
00:31:32,991 --> 00:31:35,892
Ohh! You can talk to me, thank you

443
00:31:36,395 --> 00:31:38,022
Racial prejudice I can understand...

444
00:31:38,196 --> 00:31:40,790
but ghost prejudice?
An entirely new concept

445
00:31:41,333 --> 00:31:42,357
As a matter of fact...

446
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:44,797
I think you're breaking new ground
in this area

447
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:47,334
Hey! Close the door

448
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:49,798
I can't, the only thing I can move is you

449
00:31:51,443 --> 00:31:52,341
Shit

450
00:32:03,055 --> 00:32:06,582
It's hard to believe Crys could live
in a pigpen like this

451
00:32:07,325 --> 00:32:09,816
How long was it for, huh?
A month or two?

452
00:32:10,028 --> 00:32:10,722
Four

453
00:32:11,697 --> 00:32:12,686
Four?

454
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:15,960
And she wasn't hooking when she was
living with me

455
00:32:16,168 --> 00:32:18,329
Yeah, probably too busy cleaning, huh?

456
00:32:34,219 --> 00:32:35,584
You won't go away, will you?

457
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:37,755
Well, best as I can figure,
I go where you go

458
00:32:37,989 --> 00:32:39,854
As long as that heart's beating
we're attached

459
00:32:40,058 --> 00:32:42,993
Which is why you won't be eating that
bacon, that chili, that...

460
00:32:44,262 --> 00:32:45,388
Polish sausage?

461
00:32:45,697 --> 00:32:46,721
Look, go to hell!

462
00:32:47,432 --> 00:32:48,763
That's what I'm trying to avoid

463
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:50,992
Now, look, Moony, you don't have
to like me...

464
00:32:51,203 --> 00:32:52,397
but you are gonna have to live with me

465
00:32:52,604 --> 00:32:54,834
now, whatever problem you had with me
because of Crys...

466
00:32:55,073 --> 00:32:57,132
leave it behind you because
you're gonna need me...

467
00:32:57,442 --> 00:32:58,739
if you want to help me find...

468
00:33:04,483 --> 00:33:05,245
Find her?

469
00:33:05,517 --> 00:33:06,449
Yeah

470
00:33:07,085 --> 00:33:08,074
What do you know?

471
00:33:08,153 --> 00:33:09,620
Only what happened the night
I was killed

472
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:10,913
She have something to do with that?

473
00:33:11,056 --> 00:33:12,853
Yeah, now, she and the other girl
Peisha...

474
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:14,652
they both work for this big-time gangster...

475
00:33:14,726 --> 00:33:16,318
called himself John Graham

476
00:33:16,528 --> 00:33:17,859
He dealt strictly to the upper classes

477
00:33:18,096 --> 00:33:18,755
You know, drugs, girls...

478
00:33:19,064 --> 00:33:21,760
Yeah, yeah, I know, Pimp to the stars

479
00:33:21,967 --> 00:33:23,559
Sounds like your kind of client

480
00:33:23,769 --> 00:33:25,703
Say, say, don't go there, all right?

481
00:33:25,871 --> 00:33:28,601
I represent the girls, not their employers

482
00:33:28,774 --> 00:33:30,298
Anyway, Crys called me from
the country club...

483
00:33:30,542 --> 00:33:31,804
said she was having a little legal trouble...

484
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:33,136
and asked me to pick her up

485
00:33:33,278 --> 00:33:35,246
You give all your clients that kind
of service?

486
00:33:35,413 --> 00:33:36,471
Well, she was upset

487
00:33:36,715 --> 00:33:37,704
Is that why you hit her?

488
00:33:37,949 --> 00:33:38,779
I was upset

489
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:39,984
Oh, you were both upset

490
00:33:40,218 --> 00:33:41,879
Yeah, we were both upset!
All right, Moony?

491
00:33:42,087 --> 00:33:42,985
Why don't you wash your dishes here...

492
00:33:43,288 --> 00:33:44,050
for crying out loud?

493
00:33:44,256 --> 00:33:45,188
Why did you run from me?

494
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:45,856
What?

495
00:33:46,124 --> 00:33:47,250
Come on, you're dead now

496
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:50,221
Well, Peisha was holding some crack
that she got...

497
00:33:50,495 --> 00:33:51,689
I knew it! You knew what?

498
00:33:51,897 --> 00:33:53,762
You lucky son of bitch!
If I'd have caught you...

499
00:33:53,965 --> 00:33:55,159
You couldn't have caught my mother,
Moony

500
00:33:55,367 --> 00:33:56,391
I probably got my heart attack from you.

501
00:33:56,668 --> 00:33:58,397
Well, had I known, I would've surren...

502
00:34:03,775 --> 00:34:05,367
Can ghosts get colds?

503
00:34:05,577 --> 00:34:06,771
I'm allergic to cats

504
00:34:07,479 --> 00:34:08,377
But you're dead

505
00:34:08,547 --> 00:34:09,707
It's psychological

506
00:34:13,318 --> 00:34:14,148
What's so funny?

507
00:34:14,352 --> 00:34:15,819
A hypochondriac spook

508
00:34:27,699 --> 00:34:29,394
What the fuck was all that about?

509
00:34:29,634 --> 00:34:30,726
Now we're even

510
00:34:33,705 --> 00:34:37,607
This guy who allegedly ran you
off the road...

511
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:41,879
Are you here or not here?

512
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:43,903
Yeah, I'm here

513
00:34:44,850 --> 00:34:45,908
What was his name?

514
00:34:46,284 --> 00:34:49,310
Teller, he was the muscle
you saw with the girls at the club

515
00:34:50,655 --> 00:34:54,489
If he ran you off the road, they think
you know something

516
00:34:55,861 --> 00:34:58,296
The legal problem Crys called you
about...

517
00:34:58,296 --> 00:34:59,627
maybe it was drugs

518
00:35:00,332 --> 00:35:01,856
I don't think so

519
00:35:02,734 --> 00:35:04,929
It was something more,
something bigger

520
00:35:05,537 --> 00:35:08,267
I tried to find out from the girls
but they wouldn't talk

521
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,168
At least not that night

522
00:35:13,011 --> 00:35:15,104
I didn't make it to the next morning, so...

523
00:35:16,047 --> 00:35:18,481
Yeah, it's just on the left here
Turn at the next corner

524
00:35:20,552 --> 00:35:22,679
This is Century Luxury Villas

525
00:35:23,889 --> 00:35:27,450
These things start at almost a mil, huh?

526
00:35:27,626 --> 00:35:28,684
Yeah, so?

527
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:30,851
Fix your collar and try not to
act like a cop

528
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:36,163
Shit

529
00:35:37,736 --> 00:35:39,670
How much were you pulling down
a year?

530
00:35:39,871 --> 00:35:44,365
The mortgage on a place like this
has gotta be, what, six grand a month?

531
00:35:44,542 --> 00:35:47,067
That's my lizard pot
He's got my lizard pot

532
00:35:47,345 --> 00:35:48,778
Twelve times six, seventy-two?

533
00:35:49,414 --> 00:35:50,608
Hey, you got my lizard pot!

534
00:35:51,182 --> 00:35:53,548
With tax, you're looking at eighty-five
grand a year!

535
00:35:54,653 --> 00:35:55,381
Hey, you got a pool!

536
00:35:55,553 --> 00:35:58,351
He's got my lizard pot
He's got my cactus

537
00:35:59,057 --> 00:36:01,116
Hey, that's my... where you going with...

538
00:36:02,127 --> 00:36:06,257
This is a lot of money
This is a lot of money

539
00:36:06,498 --> 00:36:07,590
Where are you going with my cactus?

540
00:36:07,866 --> 00:36:09,060
An awful lot of money

541
00:36:09,267 --> 00:36:10,131
What's going on here?

542
00:36:10,402 --> 00:36:11,426
Well, it's open house

543
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:13,365
'"All furniture, household effects...

544
00:36:13,538 --> 00:36:15,472
'"and objet d'art may be purchased'"

545
00:36:15,607 --> 00:36:17,302
Oh, mama, no

546
00:36:18,209 --> 00:36:19,107
No, I left you the house

547
00:36:19,344 --> 00:36:20,936
I didn't tell you you could sell it

548
00:36:24,516 --> 00:36:26,848
Well, what else is the old lady gonna do
with it?

549
00:36:31,756 --> 00:36:32,916
Fuck you, too

550
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:55,376
It's sterling

551
00:36:57,282 --> 00:37:00,183
Actually, I was more interested
in the picture

552
00:37:00,385 --> 00:37:02,353
You can take all the pictures if you like

553
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:05,250
In fact, I'll pay you to get rid of this harem

554
00:37:05,724 --> 00:37:07,783
My mother's a church-going woman,
so watch what you say

555
00:37:09,728 --> 00:37:10,888
Hello, Mommy

556
00:37:12,197 --> 00:37:14,893
When I think of all the in-and-out
that went on in here

557
00:37:15,734 --> 00:37:17,964
Not one grandchild to show for it

558
00:37:18,103 --> 00:37:19,866
Well, I was planning on settling down

559
00:37:20,405 --> 00:37:22,965
He always said he was planning
on settling down

560
00:37:23,308 --> 00:37:25,799
Does this hump pen look like he was
settling down to you?

561
00:37:26,111 --> 00:37:28,011
Hump pen? This place has style

562
00:37:28,213 --> 00:37:31,148
His idea of style was my idea
of obscenity

563
00:37:31,216 --> 00:37:33,047
I want to unload everything to do with it

564
00:37:33,284 --> 00:37:34,581
Yeah, but not at K-Mart prices

565
00:37:34,753 --> 00:37:36,084
Do you know this woman?

566
00:37:36,621 --> 00:37:37,610
Do I know you?

567
00:37:37,789 --> 00:37:39,916
I'm a cop You look it

568
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:41,558
I told you to fix your collar

569
00:37:42,327 --> 00:37:46,491
I'm trying to locate this girl...
Crys Gerrity

570
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:50,530
I was wondering, can I look through
your son's Rolodex?

571
00:37:52,203 --> 00:37:54,228
You can have my son's Rolodex

572
00:37:54,406 --> 00:37:55,270
What?

573
00:37:57,008 --> 00:37:59,238
But don't ask me about his women

574
00:38:00,311 --> 00:38:02,506
Have you seen her since
your son's accident?

575
00:38:08,686 --> 00:38:10,153
A cop got his heart, you know?

576
00:38:10,588 --> 00:38:11,680
He knows I know

577
00:38:11,923 --> 00:38:13,083
His name is Moony

578
00:38:13,491 --> 00:38:15,857
I know, yeah, so's mine

579
00:38:30,075 --> 00:38:36,014
She cried almost as much as I did
at the funeral

580
00:38:36,548 --> 00:38:37,913
Such a pretty girl

581
00:38:38,616 --> 00:38:40,743
Held my hand most of the day

582
00:38:42,854 --> 00:38:46,312
The last time I saw her was when
she came by here...

583
00:38:46,558 --> 00:38:47,354
to pick up a few things

584
00:38:47,559 --> 00:38:49,049
It was near Thanksgiving time, I think

585
00:38:49,294 --> 00:38:50,318
Do you know where she was going?

586
00:38:50,495 --> 00:38:52,326
She didn't say, she just drove off...

587
00:38:52,597 --> 00:38:54,690
with that slick man in his red Ferrari

588
00:38:57,368 --> 00:38:59,996
Yes, this is John Graham
Any messages?

589
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:04,501
Jackson who?

590
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:06,568
Moony

591
00:39:07,045 --> 00:39:08,535
What's that? Is that a scratch there?

592
00:39:08,813 --> 00:39:10,041
Can you buff that out, please?

593
00:39:10,515 --> 00:39:12,176
And use the toothbrush on the wheels

594
00:39:13,751 --> 00:39:15,548
If you want to get to Graham,
you gotta trust me

595
00:39:15,753 --> 00:39:18,881
Listen, asshole, already I've been
insulted...

596
00:39:19,057 --> 00:39:21,359
by the car park guy, the guy at the door

597
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:22,485
We're not leaving, Moony

598
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:25,288
Now, this may be fun to you,
but I'm damned if I'm gonna...

599
00:39:25,563 --> 00:39:27,365
pop for another three-dollar tea bag

600
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:28,491
Will you keep it down, please?

601
00:39:28,733 --> 00:39:31,668
No, if I don't hit the can soon...

602
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:34,539
Moony, the man is smart

603
00:39:34,539 --> 00:39:37,099
That's why he has an answering service
stead of a direct line

604
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:39,969
Now, would you rather him
call you back at the police station...

605
00:39:40,245 --> 00:39:42,042
or a place that makes him feel
more comfortable...

606
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,679
like the Beverly Palm Hotel?

607
00:39:45,617 --> 00:39:47,551
Call for you, Mr. Moony

608
00:39:51,022 --> 00:39:51,852
All right, remember

609
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:54,024
Howard Steadman is your best friend

610
00:39:58,730 --> 00:39:59,719
Tip him a deuce

611
00:39:59,964 --> 00:40:01,022
Two dollars

612
00:40:01,366 --> 00:40:04,199
Tip him a deuce for the phone

613
00:40:16,748 --> 00:40:18,340
Thank God nobody can see me

614
00:40:19,384 --> 00:40:20,646
Jackson Moony

615
00:40:21,019 --> 00:40:23,954
Jackson Moony, John Graham

616
00:40:24,289 --> 00:40:27,952
Sorry to pull you away from the pool
on such a delicious day...

617
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:30,457
but I got your message on my service...

618
00:40:31,196 --> 00:40:33,164
and I don't believe we've ever met

619
00:40:33,398 --> 00:40:35,730
I'm from New York, actually
I'm here on business

620
00:40:35,967 --> 00:40:40,768
Howard Steadman said that you had
a redhead named Crystal...

621
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:43,331
that you might be able to put me
in touch with

622
00:40:45,944 --> 00:40:47,206
It's a impossibility

623
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:49,842
Can you fix me up tomorrow night?

624
00:40:50,515 --> 00:40:53,643
Well, as you probably know,
Howard's in Yugoslavia...

625
00:40:53,818 --> 00:40:57,083
working on his picture,
so it's impossible for me...

626
00:40:57,355 --> 00:40:58,913
to cross-check your reference

627
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:03,526
Would it help if I mentioned...
his night of leather in Palm Springs?

628
00:41:03,695 --> 00:41:05,629
Crys said they were into gymnastics

629
00:41:06,564 --> 00:41:08,361
You must be very good friends

630
00:41:12,437 --> 00:41:13,802
You're working tomorrow night

631
00:41:20,211 --> 00:41:21,269
That's all we could find on him

632
00:41:21,446 --> 00:41:23,038
No address, no priors

633
00:41:23,248 --> 00:41:24,510
Name's probably phony

634
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:27,313
OK, thanks

635
00:41:27,752 --> 00:41:29,777
This Graham's gonna be hard to find

636
00:41:30,021 --> 00:41:31,989
Which is why you gotta keep your date
with her

637
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:33,054
You're dreaming!

638
00:41:33,224 --> 00:41:34,248
The guy deals with high rollers

639
00:41:34,826 --> 00:41:35,588
I can't afford lunch

640
00:41:35,693 --> 00:41:37,251
Where am I gonna get that kind
of money?

641
00:41:37,795 --> 00:41:38,625
Or class?

642
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:40,491
What the fuck's that supposed to mean?

643
00:41:41,532 --> 00:41:43,830
You think I got no class, huh?

644
00:41:44,102 --> 00:41:46,434
You think wearing an Italian suit
gives you class?

645
00:41:46,904 --> 00:41:48,201
It gives you nothing, nothing

646
00:41:50,441 --> 00:41:51,772
He see his doctor?

647
00:41:52,543 --> 00:41:53,601
Yesterday

648
00:41:53,845 --> 00:41:56,609
He said Posner gave him some
new medication

649
00:41:57,448 --> 00:41:58,881
Doesn't seem to be working

650
00:41:59,984 --> 00:42:01,849
Why don't you get off my back?

651
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:06,747
Just get off my back!
Go on, get the fuck off!

652
00:42:07,692 --> 00:42:09,182
Better keep an eye on him

653
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:11,485
Christ! What is it with you? Jesus!

654
00:42:11,729 --> 00:42:13,287
Let me know what he's up to

655
00:42:39,924 --> 00:42:41,152
Shit

656
00:42:44,662 --> 00:42:45,788
A bowling alley?

657
00:42:46,097 --> 00:42:48,088
I didn't know you people did this

658
00:42:48,533 --> 00:42:50,023
Yeah, and we swim, too

659
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:51,834
Now, look, just relax, all right?

660
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:53,537
We're just here to pick up a little
pocket change

661
00:42:53,805 --> 00:42:54,772
You're with the owner

662
00:42:55,006 --> 00:42:55,665
The what?

663
00:42:55,773 --> 00:42:58,105
The owner, you think I got rich
defending hookers?

664
00:42:58,176 --> 00:43:00,770
You know what the cash return is
on a pair of bowling shoes?

665
00:43:00,978 --> 00:43:02,809
We're on our way back to the pin setters

666
00:43:03,915 --> 00:43:05,177
Just... loosen up

667
00:43:15,927 --> 00:43:18,293
Two drink minimum if you don't bowl

668
00:43:19,197 --> 00:43:20,932
Yeah, that's right
There's a two drink minimum

669
00:43:20,932 --> 00:43:22,297
There's nothing wrong with making
a little profit

670
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:23,860
Now say hello to Bubba

671
00:43:24,302 --> 00:43:25,200
Ask him how his mother is

672
00:43:25,503 --> 00:43:26,629
Order a couple of beers

673
00:43:27,505 --> 00:43:30,241
Hello, Bubba, how's your mother?

674
00:43:30,241 --> 00:43:32,038
She died last summer

675
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:35,540
Well, I'm a little behind

676
00:43:37,582 --> 00:43:39,209
I'll take a couple of beers

677
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:41,945
Which way to the pin setters?

678
00:43:43,488 --> 00:43:44,455
Stone!

679
00:43:46,758 --> 00:43:50,990
Every one of these mothers is
a Black Panther hungry for white meat

680
00:43:51,229 --> 00:43:53,060
I'm gonna wind up dish of the day

681
00:43:55,566 --> 00:43:56,931
What are we doing here?

682
00:43:59,971 --> 00:44:01,029
See that hole over there?

683
00:44:01,272 --> 00:44:01,931
The one that looks like a duck?

684
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:03,068
Yeah

685
00:44:07,845 --> 00:44:09,403
You feel a pipe in there? Yeah

686
00:44:09,614 --> 00:44:10,478
All right, pull it out

687
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:12,471
Yeah, that's it

688
00:44:19,290 --> 00:44:20,348
Jesus!

689
00:44:22,693 --> 00:44:24,684
My emergency cash reserve

690
00:44:24,929 --> 00:44:25,987
How much is in here?

691
00:44:26,264 --> 00:44:28,232
Two hundred thousand dollars

692
00:44:28,699 --> 00:44:31,327
And I'm the only guy who was ever able
to take it with him

693
00:44:39,243 --> 00:44:40,267
Don't want your beers?

694
00:44:40,445 --> 00:44:41,343
Have a beer

695
00:44:41,546 --> 00:44:43,241
Yeah, maybe just one Yeah, one beer

696
00:44:43,448 --> 00:44:44,005
Can I help you?

697
00:44:44,215 --> 00:44:45,682
Hey, it's my brother Archimedes

698
00:44:45,883 --> 00:44:47,248
You find what you were looking for
back there?

699
00:44:47,485 --> 00:44:48,452
Nice guy, I left him the bar

700
00:44:48,619 --> 00:44:50,314
A few balls, a couple of pins

701
00:44:51,756 --> 00:44:52,780
Here it is

702
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:54,957
How do they know about my stash?

703
00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:57,025
And maybe a hundred and fifty grand?

704
00:44:57,161 --> 00:44:59,425
How did you know... 150?
I left $200,000...

705
00:45:00,064 --> 00:45:02,328
It's supposed to be
two hundred thousand

706
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:04,660
Oh, I see, you steal from your
own brother

707
00:45:04,869 --> 00:45:06,860
You own... you flesh...
You know, Ma said you was...

708
00:45:07,104 --> 00:45:08,799
You know, if I wasn't dead, I'll...

709
00:45:09,173 --> 00:45:10,975
Hit him one time for me, Moony,
would you, please?

710
00:45:10,975 --> 00:45:13,409
Did you know that this is
extortion money?

711
00:45:13,878 --> 00:45:15,311
That your brother was about to
be brought up...

712
00:45:15,613 --> 00:45:17,444
on Federal charges when he died?

713
00:45:17,648 --> 00:45:19,275
Yeah, slap him one time for me

714
00:45:19,617 --> 00:45:21,881
Now, I can walk out of here
with this evidence...

715
00:45:24,055 --> 00:45:30,358
Or I can walk out of here with
this evidence and you

716
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:32,628
It's your choice, Archimedes

717
00:45:39,637 --> 00:45:40,661
Right

718
00:45:40,805 --> 00:45:41,601
Hold it, hold it, hold it, wait

719
00:45:41,806 --> 00:45:42,534
What?

720
00:45:44,208 --> 00:45:45,402
Oh, shit!

721
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:47,399
Jesus!

722
00:45:52,016 --> 00:45:52,744
Get him out of there!

723
00:45:54,318 --> 00:45:55,512
That was the most stupid...

724
00:45:55,987 --> 00:45:58,217
I'm sorry, just start... let's go!

725
00:45:58,456 --> 00:45:59,650
Go, go, go!

726
00:46:07,298 --> 00:46:09,289
You want to tell me what the hell
that was all about?

727
00:46:29,086 --> 00:46:31,054
So I was talking to a friend of mine
the other day...

728
00:46:31,255 --> 00:46:31,914
and I hate to drop names...

729
00:46:32,189 --> 00:46:33,451
you know that, but I said, '"Bobby... '"

730
00:46:33,691 --> 00:46:35,215
Well, that's Bobby DeNiro,
but that's beside the point

731
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:36,949
'"Bobby, the thing is this... '"

732
00:46:37,128 --> 00:46:38,459
Listen, what time is it?

733
00:46:38,796 --> 00:46:42,254
It's time for you to get your big, fat,
extra-crispy-bucket-o'-chicken...

734
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:44,400
two-liter-pepsi-cola-drinking ass
out of bed

735
00:46:44,569 --> 00:46:46,161
That's what time it I, allez, allez!

736
00:46:46,437 --> 00:46:48,064
We must exercise!
Come on, Jack, let's go!

737
00:46:48,339 --> 00:46:50,364
And one, two, three, four!
Come on, Jack,

738
00:46:50,575 --> 00:46:51,439
Your public is waiting

739
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:52,370
Public, my ass

740
00:46:52,577 --> 00:46:54,204
Well, it'll be your ass if you don't
hurry up and get up

741
00:46:54,478 --> 00:46:55,911
We have to go downtown,
we have to exercise...

742
00:46:56,147 --> 00:46:57,341
we have to get into some suits

743
00:46:57,682 --> 00:46:59,912
Get your black ass out of here, will you?

744
00:47:00,117 --> 00:47:01,516
Black man!
'"Get your black ass out of here'"

745
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:02,786
I like that, get down, brother!

746
00:47:03,087 --> 00:47:04,418
Give me five! All right!

747
00:47:04,622 --> 00:47:05,111
There's five

748
00:47:05,289 --> 00:47:06,620
Fuck off!

749
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:20,332
Shit! I never knew...
there were so many hills in Hollywood

750
00:47:22,707 --> 00:47:24,140
Fuck off!

751
00:47:24,875 --> 00:47:26,069
Come on, come on, look at me!

752
00:47:26,310 --> 00:47:27,299
I'm running circles around you

753
00:47:28,646 --> 00:47:30,477
And you're supposed to be a cop, huh?

754
00:47:30,648 --> 00:47:31,808
Is this L.A.'s finest, huh?

755
00:47:32,016 --> 00:47:33,108
I'm a cop! Yeah, yeah!

756
00:47:33,317 --> 00:47:34,045
Oh, well!

757
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:36,179
Get the fuck out of here! Shit!

758
00:50:28,259 --> 00:50:31,387
He bought an $80,000 Mercedes-Benz
with cash?

759
00:50:31,562 --> 00:50:32,961
It's not the Jack Moony I know

760
00:50:33,063 --> 00:50:35,031
I don't know what the hell he's doing

761
00:50:35,466 --> 00:50:37,832
Whatever he's doing,
it's got to be illegal

762
00:50:45,743 --> 00:50:47,108
Well, we better get ready

763
00:50:47,278 --> 00:50:48,768
They're dropping Crys off at eight

764
00:50:49,613 --> 00:50:51,547
Did she really like this stuff?

765
00:50:52,116 --> 00:50:53,743
She never seemed to mind 'em on me

766
00:50:55,586 --> 00:50:56,644
Oh, come on, Moony, look

767
00:50:56,887 --> 00:50:58,548
We fooled around, all right?

768
00:50:59,557 --> 00:51:01,115
She took some pictures
That was the end of it

769
00:51:01,458 --> 00:51:02,447
It wasn't serious

770
00:51:03,561 --> 00:51:04,994
I was a single guy, you heard my mother

771
00:51:05,262 --> 00:51:07,890
Last thing I needed or wanted was
to be tied down

772
00:51:08,866 --> 00:51:15,567
Hey, look, what you gotta face is
the fact that she left the old Jack Moony

773
00:51:15,773 --> 00:51:18,139
See, this is not the same girl who was
on the street corner...

774
00:51:18,375 --> 00:51:20,434
dating cops and eating cheeseburgers

775
00:51:20,811 --> 00:51:21,903
She's a different woman now

776
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:23,011
Same job

777
00:51:23,214 --> 00:51:25,182
Yeah, but didn't she ever tell you about
going to art school?

778
00:51:27,117 --> 00:51:29,745
It was a pipe dream, you saw her stuff

779
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,945
Oh, and we're art critics now, huh?

780
00:51:33,023 --> 00:51:36,652
You know, you see a kid fishing
in a mud puddle

781
00:51:36,794 --> 00:51:38,853
Is that any reason to take away his pole?

782
00:51:39,230 --> 00:51:41,289
People have dreams, Moony
They have ambitions

783
00:51:41,465 --> 00:51:42,557
And when she tells you about
her dreams...

784
00:51:42,833 --> 00:51:44,357
you gotta respect them, you gotta listen

785
00:51:44,602 --> 00:51:45,864
I always listened

786
00:51:46,670 --> 00:51:47,602
Yeah?

787
00:51:48,205 --> 00:51:49,194
I listened

788
00:51:50,241 --> 00:51:51,868
All right, all right

789
00:51:54,578 --> 00:51:56,569
What's the name of her dog back home?

790
00:51:59,917 --> 00:52:00,815
Henry

791
00:52:02,286 --> 00:52:03,776
How many sisters does she have?

792
00:52:05,389 --> 00:52:07,584
Two... Lisa and Joanie

793
00:52:09,159 --> 00:52:10,490
What's her favorite movie?

794
00:52:11,762 --> 00:52:12,626
'"Rambo'"

795
00:52:15,099 --> 00:52:16,123
'"Rambo'"?

796
00:52:17,735 --> 00:52:18,702
'"Pinocchio'"

797
00:52:18,869 --> 00:52:20,928
And I knew all of that in the first half-hour

798
00:52:21,705 --> 00:52:24,503
You see? That's why she left Ohio,
Moony

799
00:52:25,609 --> 00:52:26,667
Nobody listened

800
00:52:27,111 --> 00:52:28,271
Nobody took her seriously...

801
00:52:28,612 --> 00:52:30,102
and you're wondering why she left you

802
00:52:30,281 --> 00:52:31,543
I kept her off the streets

803
00:52:31,715 --> 00:52:35,082
Yes, by wrapping her up so tight,
she couldn't move

804
00:52:35,319 --> 00:52:37,287
You see, you want to keep everybody
in little boxes

805
00:52:37,521 --> 00:52:38,749
You want to keep me in the ghetto

806
00:52:38,956 --> 00:52:40,287
You want to keep Crys back at home

807
00:52:40,491 --> 00:52:41,617
Even that knucklehead Wendt

808
00:52:41,825 --> 00:52:45,090
And you tell me that you don't resent him
being your superior officer

809
00:52:46,530 --> 00:52:47,519
Yeah, you can't, can you?

810
00:52:47,731 --> 00:52:51,326
You see, we're all like the film
in the goldfish bowl at your home

811
00:52:51,568 --> 00:52:53,126
You want to keep us all right there...

812
00:52:53,404 --> 00:52:54,894
where you can see us, don't you?

813
00:52:55,139 --> 00:52:56,800
You don't want to let it out to
be developed

814
00:52:57,007 --> 00:52:58,634
You know how much that stuff costs
to process?

815
00:52:58,809 --> 00:53:00,606
Hey, it costs to go to art school

816
00:53:00,878 --> 00:53:02,345
It costs to be a lawyer

817
00:53:02,579 --> 00:53:03,910
It costs to be a fucking detective

818
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:06,411
Some of us are willing
to pay the price, Moony

819
00:53:19,463 --> 00:53:21,328
Hey, there's nothing
to be scared of, Moony

820
00:53:24,101 --> 00:53:25,500
Nobody's out to get you

821
00:53:28,739 --> 00:53:31,333
You don't have to be scared
that we're all gonna leave you behind

822
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:04,701
Would you like something from the bar?

823
00:54:04,875 --> 00:54:06,240
Yeah, ask her first

824
00:54:07,544 --> 00:54:08,511
What do you think?

825
00:54:08,846 --> 00:54:09,747
A glass of wine

826
00:54:09,747 --> 00:54:11,374
Wine list, a couple of Evians

827
00:54:11,582 --> 00:54:13,174
The wine list and two Evians

828
00:54:17,021 --> 00:54:18,147
The wine list

829
00:54:20,991 --> 00:54:23,323
I didn't know you knew what Evian was

830
00:54:23,527 --> 00:54:24,619
Bottled water

831
00:54:25,496 --> 00:54:26,622
I'm learning

832
00:54:27,131 --> 00:54:28,223
What are you doing?

833
00:54:29,299 --> 00:54:30,891
Is this some kind of a setup?

834
00:54:31,301 --> 00:54:32,233
What do you mean?

835
00:54:32,436 --> 00:54:33,733
Are you gonna bust me?

836
00:54:34,004 --> 00:54:34,868
For what?

837
00:54:35,339 --> 00:54:36,203
Bein' beautiful?

838
00:54:37,041 --> 00:54:38,406
Touche

839
00:54:40,577 --> 00:54:42,442
Did you process any of my film?

840
00:54:43,013 --> 00:54:43,980
Why?

841
00:54:45,883 --> 00:54:46,713
I wondered

842
00:54:49,353 --> 00:54:51,344
It's still in the goldfish bowl

843
00:54:53,157 --> 00:54:54,055
Good

844
00:54:57,728 --> 00:54:58,717
Nice suit

845
00:54:58,929 --> 00:54:59,793
Yeah

846
00:55:00,230 --> 00:55:01,390
Did you polish your fingernails?

847
00:55:01,598 --> 00:55:02,997
Did I tell you I knew what a woman likes?

848
00:55:03,233 --> 00:55:05,463
You can't afford that on a cop's salary

849
00:55:05,903 --> 00:55:07,336
Oh, I, uh...

850
00:55:07,571 --> 00:55:08,697
I came into some money

851
00:55:09,339 --> 00:55:10,533
How?

852
00:55:10,707 --> 00:55:11,901
Oh, shit, how?

853
00:55:12,142 --> 00:55:13,905
Don't tell me it's an inheritance

854
00:55:14,111 --> 00:55:15,908
No, she's too smart for that

855
00:55:17,181 --> 00:55:18,011
Malpractice

856
00:55:18,182 --> 00:55:19,274
Malpractice

857
00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:21,274
Your heart surgery

858
00:55:21,485 --> 00:55:23,817
Yeah, they stitched me up
with a sponge inside

859
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:25,781
Good

860
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:27,115
Judges like that one

861
00:55:27,324 --> 00:55:30,418
So then you quit the force and started
buying Italian suits?

862
00:55:30,661 --> 00:55:31,787
Right, yeah

863
00:55:32,629 --> 00:55:33,789
I don't believe that

864
00:55:34,131 --> 00:55:35,462
Yeah, neither do I

865
00:55:37,434 --> 00:55:40,835
OK, maybe you better go and call Teller

866
00:55:41,138 --> 00:55:42,036
That's dangerous

867
00:55:45,776 --> 00:55:46,743
I don't want to

868
00:55:47,311 --> 00:55:48,209
Lucky

869
00:55:52,382 --> 00:55:53,508
How's Chuck?

870
00:55:53,717 --> 00:55:54,684
He's fat

871
00:55:55,018 --> 00:55:56,042
I would like to tempt you...

872
00:55:56,286 --> 00:55:58,618
with the chef's specials
before you decide

873
00:55:59,456 --> 00:56:04,325
For appetizer, we have a shitake
and mushroom...

874
00:56:04,595 --> 00:56:08,964
on the salmon dim sum dumpling
in a red currant sauce

875
00:56:09,333 --> 00:56:11,858
Salmon dumplings in currant sauce

876
00:56:12,236 --> 00:56:14,295
Are you still puttin' bourbon in his milk?

877
00:56:14,771 --> 00:56:15,829
No

878
00:56:16,373 --> 00:56:18,034
We're both reformed men

879
00:56:18,842 --> 00:56:19,866
That's too bad

880
00:56:20,043 --> 00:56:23,706
There is also a special poached scallop
with taro...

881
00:56:23,914 --> 00:56:27,816
over a bed of squid ink fettuccine
with a ginger root sauce

882
00:56:29,286 --> 00:56:30,913
Do you remember your tablecloth?

883
00:56:31,155 --> 00:56:31,883
Yeah

884
00:56:32,055 --> 00:56:35,354
Well, I... I had it... I had it cleaned
and mended

885
00:56:35,592 --> 00:56:36,320
You didn't have to do that

886
00:56:36,527 --> 00:56:39,621
No, you... you remember
the armenian lady next door?

887
00:56:39,830 --> 00:56:41,661
Mrs. Arkmanian

888
00:56:41,865 --> 00:56:42,695
Yeah! Yeah

889
00:56:45,602 --> 00:56:48,093
Well, she saw the, um, you know...

890
00:56:48,539 --> 00:56:49,164
Embroidery?

891
00:56:49,373 --> 00:56:53,070
Yeah, well, she said
that was really good.

892
00:56:55,412 --> 00:56:58,745
Then a duck feet, dim-sum style this,

893
00:56:58,949 --> 00:57:01,713
over a bed of arugula with
a spicy rice vinegar...

894
00:57:01,885 --> 00:57:04,319
Is he serious? He's serious

895
00:57:04,555 --> 00:57:06,580
And finally we have the...

896
00:57:06,723 --> 00:57:08,953
egg roll with a...

897
00:57:10,327 --> 00:57:12,022
s-s-shredd-ed-ed squid...

898
00:57:12,196 --> 00:57:12,753
'"Squeed'"

899
00:57:13,030 --> 00:57:15,931
Shred-ed-ed squid!

900
00:57:16,133 --> 00:57:17,157
Eggplant...

901
00:57:17,401 --> 00:57:20,097
fresh stalk fennel, salmon,
ground oysters...

902
00:57:28,879 --> 00:57:29,777
Excuse me

903
00:57:35,786 --> 00:57:36,946
What the hell do you think you're doing?

904
00:57:37,154 --> 00:57:38,519
Back off! Back off?

905
00:57:38,689 --> 00:57:40,179
Look, I did not make this kind
of investment...

906
00:57:40,390 --> 00:57:41,652
to see you blowing it with that girl!

907
00:57:41,825 --> 00:57:43,554
I am not blowin' it!

908
00:57:43,894 --> 00:57:46,988
Listen, I thank you for helpin' me
find Crys...

909
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:49,496
I thank you for the car, for the hotel...

910
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:50,462
for the clothes!

911
00:57:50,734 --> 00:57:53,532
I even thank you for the goddamn
nail polish!

912
00:57:53,870 --> 00:57:55,235
This is my date...

913
00:57:55,539 --> 00:57:56,563
and my night...

914
00:57:56,773 --> 00:57:58,934
and I want you to back the hell off!

915
00:57:59,142 --> 00:58:00,268
Oh, I see, I see

916
00:58:00,410 --> 00:58:02,503
So, I can set up the date, I can buy you
the clothes...

917
00:58:02,746 --> 00:58:03,735
but she starts making eyes at you...

918
00:58:04,081 --> 00:58:04,979
and you don't need me anymore,
is that it?

919
00:58:05,082 --> 00:58:06,310
No! I don't need you anymore

920
00:58:06,717 --> 00:58:08,685
Well, did it occur to you that she's a pro?

921
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:10,612
Has it occurred to you that you're...

922
00:58:10,954 --> 00:58:11,886
that I'm paying for this?

923
00:58:12,055 --> 00:58:12,885
Yes!

924
00:58:14,625 --> 00:58:15,887
Yes, it did

925
00:58:17,694 --> 00:58:19,628
But maybe I wanna pretend, huh?

926
00:58:20,297 --> 00:58:22,527
Maybe it's easier for me to pretend...

927
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:25,561
if her ex... whatever you were...

928
00:58:25,769 --> 00:58:27,430
is not hangin' over her shoulder...

929
00:58:27,638 --> 00:58:29,367
tellin' me to order squid dum-dum!

930
00:58:29,673 --> 00:58:30,503
Dim sum

931
00:58:31,575 --> 00:58:34,100
Dim sum Dim sum

932
00:58:34,278 --> 00:58:35,802
And you're gonna ask her about
what happened that night

933
00:58:36,013 --> 00:58:38,481
Yeah! Yeah, OK, I'm gonna ask her!

934
00:58:44,187 --> 00:58:45,154
Where's the waiter?

935
00:58:46,857 --> 00:58:49,417
I think he has a few other tables

936
00:58:50,594 --> 00:58:51,458
Yeah

937
00:58:52,562 --> 00:58:54,792
Hey, why don't...

938
00:58:55,799 --> 00:58:56,663
What?

939
00:59:02,272 --> 00:59:03,739
What were you gonna say?

940
00:59:06,343 --> 00:59:07,367
Where...

941
00:59:09,179 --> 00:59:11,443
of all the places in this city...

942
00:59:12,683 --> 00:59:13,911
Where do you want to eat?

943
00:59:18,021 --> 00:59:19,113
I don't get it

944
00:59:20,257 --> 00:59:22,282
I always had to drag you down here

945
00:59:22,526 --> 00:59:25,393
Hey, allow for a little growth

946
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:26,494
A little growth

947
00:59:27,030 --> 00:59:28,759
I mean, you can only eat so much...

948
00:59:29,032 --> 00:59:31,000
S-s-shredd-ed-ed squid!

949
00:59:32,436 --> 00:59:35,735
Before eight-ball and tube steak looks
pretty good.

950
00:59:39,443 --> 00:59:41,673
So... how we doing?

951
00:59:41,945 --> 00:59:43,378
We're down six points

952
00:59:50,787 --> 00:59:52,345
Moon! What?

953
00:59:54,758 --> 00:59:57,090
Hey! What?

954
00:59:57,728 --> 00:59:59,025
Oh, you wanna play, huh?

955
00:59:59,429 --> 01:00:00,327
Come on

956
01:00:00,597 --> 01:00:01,621
You wanna play

957
01:00:01,798 --> 01:00:02,696
So what do you wanna do?

958
01:00:02,933 --> 01:00:04,025
I'll show you what I can do!

959
01:00:04,301 --> 01:00:05,290
Stop it!

960
01:00:09,072 --> 01:00:09,936
I didn't!

961
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:11,400
Yes, you did

962
01:00:35,265 --> 01:00:37,392
Is it OK if I take this stuff off?

963
01:00:37,834 --> 01:00:38,766
Sure

964
01:00:41,872 --> 01:00:43,032
Whatever you want

965
01:01:31,388 --> 01:01:33,083
Sometimes...

966
01:01:33,523 --> 01:01:35,013
I just get so tired...

967
01:01:35,258 --> 01:01:37,249
of doing everything the hard way

968
01:01:37,861 --> 01:01:38,987
Yeah

969
01:01:39,162 --> 01:01:40,527
Yeah

970
01:01:46,069 --> 01:01:48,833
Oh, God, I missed you

971
01:01:49,039 --> 01:01:50,336
Oh, yeah

972
01:01:51,508 --> 01:01:52,941
Oh, yeah

973
01:02:05,155 --> 01:02:06,247
Does it hurt?

974
01:02:08,091 --> 01:02:11,754
Not much anymore

975
01:02:14,397 --> 01:02:16,865
They say that the blood an tissue types...

976
01:02:17,033 --> 01:02:19,126
have to be an exact match

977
01:02:24,541 --> 01:02:26,133
You and Leon

978
01:02:30,146 --> 01:02:31,670
Blood brothers

979
01:02:31,882 --> 01:02:33,076
Get out of here

980
01:02:33,884 --> 01:02:35,351
Oh, Moon

981
01:02:38,088 --> 01:02:39,953
He was a good guy

982
01:02:41,124 --> 01:02:42,853
You would've liked him

983
01:02:48,431 --> 01:02:50,763
You reminded me of him tonight

984
01:02:53,436 --> 01:02:55,199
Maybe it's his heart

985
01:03:07,350 --> 01:03:07,975
Oh, fuck

986
01:03:08,718 --> 01:03:09,742
What's up?

987
01:03:10,220 --> 01:03:11,551
I gotta go

988
01:03:15,158 --> 01:03:15,715
You know...

989
01:03:17,060 --> 01:03:18,994
I like... I liked your pictures

990
01:03:20,764 --> 01:03:23,392
And all those things you were tellin' me?

991
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,433
I was listening

992
01:03:27,671 --> 01:03:30,799
Like, I... I know you had a dog
named Henry...

993
01:03:31,474 --> 01:03:33,465
and a couple of sisters

994
01:03:34,144 --> 01:03:36,977
Lisa and, uh...

995
01:03:37,180 --> 01:03:38,306
Joanie

996
01:03:39,883 --> 01:03:40,872
Yeah

997
01:03:41,818 --> 01:03:44,651
And your favorite movie is Pinocchio

998
01:03:44,821 --> 01:03:45,913
Pinocchio?

999
01:03:46,222 --> 01:03:48,452
Oh, please! Pinocchio?!

1000
01:03:48,625 --> 01:03:49,956
What am I always talkin' about?

1001
01:03:50,226 --> 01:03:51,750
The Parent Trap!

1002
01:03:51,962 --> 01:03:53,054
Moon!

1003
01:03:54,297 --> 01:03:57,960
So, you're using my material, too, huh?

1004
01:03:58,635 --> 01:03:59,795
Yeah, Pinocchio

1005
01:04:00,003 --> 01:04:01,561
So I lied, sue me

1006
01:04:01,805 --> 01:04:02,829
Put out that cigarette

1007
01:04:03,006 --> 01:04:04,906
It's her You smoked it

1008
01:04:09,980 --> 01:04:11,777
What else did you see?

1009
01:04:12,048 --> 01:04:14,278
Enough to know that you didn't ask her
about what happened that night

1010
01:04:14,517 --> 01:04:15,211
I'm workin' up to it

1011
01:04:15,452 --> 01:04:17,215
That's bullshit, Moony

1012
01:04:17,454 --> 01:04:18,853
Look, she needs time

1013
01:04:19,055 --> 01:04:19,783
This is delicate!

1014
01:04:19,990 --> 01:04:20,957
I kept my part of the bargain

1015
01:04:21,324 --> 01:04:23,383
You asked me to back off, I backed off

1016
01:04:23,660 --> 01:04:25,491
I kept my part of the bargain
Now you keep yours

1017
01:04:25,695 --> 01:04:27,287
You're pissed because we're hittin' it off

1018
01:04:27,430 --> 01:04:28,488
Yes

1019
01:04:29,199 --> 01:04:30,063
No

1020
01:04:31,101 --> 01:04:35,936
Yes... no, I'm pissed because
the guy who killed me isn't behind bars

1021
01:04:36,272 --> 01:04:38,137
You wouldn't even be here if
it wasn't for me, Moony

1022
01:04:38,408 --> 01:04:39,602
you wouldn't even be here, not with Crys...

1023
01:04:39,809 --> 01:04:42,073
not at the Beverly Palm Hotel,
not on this earth

1024
01:04:42,245 --> 01:04:45,305
So when she comes back in this room
I want you to ask her what happened!

1025
01:04:51,921 --> 01:04:52,910
Were you talkin' to someone?

1026
01:04:53,123 --> 01:04:53,680
Room service

1027
01:04:53,923 --> 01:04:54,685
Oh, room service

1028
01:04:54,891 --> 01:04:56,085
Don't order for me, I have to go

1029
01:04:56,292 --> 01:04:57,156
Ask her

1030
01:04:57,661 --> 01:04:59,026
Can't you stay for breakfast?

1031
01:04:59,429 --> 01:05:00,327
It's not me, it's Graham

1032
01:05:00,530 --> 01:05:01,155
Ask her

1033
01:05:01,331 --> 01:05:02,195
Call you at home

1034
01:05:03,066 --> 01:05:03,930
Yeah

1035
01:05:07,170 --> 01:05:08,797
Uh, Crys...

1036
01:05:09,105 --> 01:05:10,834
What? That...

1037
01:05:11,374 --> 01:05:13,069
the night, uh...

1038
01:05:13,877 --> 01:05:15,139
Stone died...

1039
01:05:15,812 --> 01:05:17,677
the night I chased you, remember?

1040
01:05:18,648 --> 01:05:19,740
Hard to forget

1041
01:05:19,949 --> 01:05:20,881
Mmm, yeah

1042
01:05:22,085 --> 01:05:26,545
Did anything happen
before he picked you up that...

1043
01:05:27,824 --> 01:05:29,655
might have caused his murder?

1044
01:05:30,894 --> 01:05:32,418
Oh, shit!

1045
01:05:32,662 --> 01:05:33,526
No, Crys... I knew it!

1046
01:05:33,730 --> 01:05:34,287
Crys, please...

1047
01:05:34,531 --> 01:05:35,589
Crys, listen to me! Crys!

1048
01:05:36,199 --> 01:05:37,461
Crys, please!

1049
01:05:37,667 --> 01:05:40,363
Crys, it's not like that! Listen! Crys!

1050
01:05:42,005 --> 01:05:42,972
Come on, Moony!

1051
01:05:44,974 --> 01:05:45,998
Hurry up! She's getting away

1052
01:05:46,176 --> 01:05:47,074
So are my pants!

1053
01:05:50,380 --> 01:05:51,278
Harry

1054
01:05:51,481 --> 01:05:53,210
Harry, I think something's going on
down here!

1055
01:05:58,321 --> 01:06:00,186
Crys! Come on!

1056
01:06:00,423 --> 01:06:03,221
I shouldn't have asked her!

1057
01:06:03,393 --> 01:06:04,382
We should've waited!

1058
01:06:04,627 --> 01:06:06,754
For what? So you two could have
another go in bed?

1059
01:06:07,297 --> 01:06:08,264
You stayed in the living room

1060
01:06:08,465 --> 01:06:09,727
Of course, you think I can learn anything...

1061
01:06:09,999 --> 01:06:11,023
watching a white boy? Huh?

1062
01:06:11,234 --> 01:06:12,633
Well, according to Crys you can!

1063
01:06:12,836 --> 01:06:13,666
Oh, all right, Superman

1064
01:06:13,903 --> 01:06:15,131
Well, give it your best shot, then

1065
01:06:16,239 --> 01:06:18,139
That's it, you got it, you got it

1066
01:06:20,143 --> 01:06:21,167
Mercedes keys

1067
01:06:21,511 --> 01:06:23,103
They're all Mercedes keys!

1068
01:06:23,313 --> 01:06:24,940
Yeah, that one

1069
01:06:26,983 --> 01:06:27,915
Hey, Moon?

1070
01:06:32,489 --> 01:06:33,513
Harry?

1071
01:06:34,124 --> 01:06:35,250
What are you...

1072
01:06:42,465 --> 01:06:43,454
I found it

1073
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:44,892
Bullshit

1074
01:06:45,468 --> 01:06:46,867
I inherited it

1075
01:06:48,404 --> 01:06:49,666
A bunch of crap

1076
01:06:50,573 --> 01:06:53,201
I was given it by a dead ni...

1077
01:06:55,111 --> 01:06:58,103
lawyer... to find out who killed him

1078
01:06:58,882 --> 01:06:59,678
Very good

1079
01:06:59,849 --> 01:07:00,713
I didn't know you had it in you

1080
01:07:00,950 --> 01:07:02,076
Now, you see how easy that was?

1081
01:07:04,988 --> 01:07:06,649
Today is my golf day...

1082
01:07:06,890 --> 01:07:09,188
and my foursome teed off about
twenty minutes ago

1083
01:07:09,392 --> 01:07:11,656
Maybe if I hurry, I can catch them
on the back nine

1084
01:07:12,428 --> 01:07:13,224
Hold him

1085
01:07:13,429 --> 01:07:14,054
He can't hold you

1086
01:07:14,297 --> 01:07:15,355
You can't hold me

1087
01:07:15,532 --> 01:07:16,829
Hmm, the hell I can't

1088
01:07:17,033 --> 01:07:18,864
Not without bail Not without bail

1089
01:07:24,841 --> 01:07:26,536
I got you, Moony

1090
01:07:26,876 --> 01:07:28,275
Maybe not this minute...

1091
01:07:28,745 --> 01:07:30,372
but I got you

1092
01:07:30,580 --> 01:07:31,740
Who got you that hat?

1093
01:07:32,715 --> 01:07:37,448
I want you in here at eight tomorrow
for a full psychiatric examination...

1094
01:07:37,687 --> 01:07:40,155
and until that time, you are suspended!

1095
01:07:40,356 --> 01:07:41,789
Yeah, that's what you need, suspenders

1096
01:07:42,025 --> 01:07:43,014
And you leave your badge...

1097
01:07:43,393 --> 01:07:47,921
Leave my badge and my piece
with Rinselle on the way out

1098
01:07:49,098 --> 01:07:49,996
Fore!

1099
01:07:51,201 --> 01:07:52,225
Fuck it!

1100
01:07:55,872 --> 01:07:57,339
Why the hell did I listen to you?

1101
01:07:57,607 --> 01:07:58,266
We gotta find Crys

1102
01:07:58,474 --> 01:07:59,998
We found her! You made me blow it!

1103
01:08:00,243 --> 01:08:00,971
Hey, I'm doin' this for you

1104
01:08:01,211 --> 01:08:01,973
For me? For you

1105
01:08:02,178 --> 01:08:03,304
For me? For you

1106
01:08:03,580 --> 01:08:05,138
You've just got me thrown off the force!

1107
01:08:05,381 --> 01:08:07,110
I'm on my way to a mental institution!

1108
01:08:07,917 --> 01:08:08,906
Well, nobody's perfect

1109
01:08:09,118 --> 01:08:10,585
Shit! Jack?

1110
01:08:14,891 --> 01:08:16,358
You... you OK?

1111
01:08:21,564 --> 01:08:23,589
Look, I just wanted you to know...

1112
01:08:23,833 --> 01:08:25,926
that I was following you 'cause
I was concerned...

1113
01:08:26,302 --> 01:08:27,769
not because of Wendt

1114
01:08:28,404 --> 01:08:29,564
Sure, Harry

1115
01:08:30,240 --> 01:08:33,073
I mean, you need help, partner
You really do

1116
01:08:34,244 --> 01:08:35,268
Yeah

1117
01:08:35,645 --> 01:08:37,476
Go home and get some sleep, OK?

1118
01:08:38,348 --> 01:08:39,280
Yeah

1119
01:09:01,271 --> 01:09:03,603
Get the fuck away from me!

1120
01:09:03,806 --> 01:09:04,773
Get away!

1121
01:09:47,350 --> 01:09:48,112
What?

1122
01:09:52,021 --> 01:09:53,352
Chuck, get out of there

1123
01:09:55,959 --> 01:09:58,257
Come on, Moony, you can't order
an autopsy report...

1124
01:09:58,561 --> 01:09:59,220
when you're on suspension

1125
01:09:59,462 --> 01:10:00,895
Well, do it in Harry's name

1126
01:10:01,831 --> 01:10:02,855
I'll clear it with him

1127
01:10:04,567 --> 01:10:06,000
The man was a U.S. Senator

1128
01:10:06,169 --> 01:10:07,329
What do I say we're looking for?

1129
01:10:08,638 --> 01:10:09,764
Cocaine

1130
01:10:10,840 --> 01:10:12,774
You know what kind of scandal
this could be?

1131
01:10:13,443 --> 01:10:16,105
It's a cover-up thing,
like the Redford movie

1132
01:10:16,346 --> 01:10:18,371
We're not gonna find anything
in that autopsy report

1133
01:10:18,614 --> 01:10:20,206
Right, right, what's that got to do
with finding Crys out here?

1134
01:10:20,416 --> 01:10:22,748
She had black spots on the bottom
of her feet

1135
01:10:23,252 --> 01:10:24,276
Black spot... yeah?

1136
01:10:24,520 --> 01:10:25,418
It was beach tar

1137
01:10:25,888 --> 01:10:27,412
You know? Beach tar

1138
01:10:28,257 --> 01:10:32,455
There's not a lot of beaches up here
that have enough to stick

1139
01:10:32,762 --> 01:10:33,751
Yeah? Right

1140
01:10:33,963 --> 01:10:38,991
Now, in police work, that...
coupled with a Malibu speeding ticket...

1141
01:10:39,302 --> 01:10:40,234
and you've got...

1142
01:10:41,237 --> 01:10:42,169
You got what?

1143
01:10:46,275 --> 01:10:48,209
Oh, get the fuck out of here

1144
01:10:48,745 --> 01:10:49,609
This is too easy

1145
01:10:49,746 --> 01:10:50,838
Now, wait a minute, Jack, remember...

1146
01:10:51,114 --> 01:10:51,978
I know what to say

1147
01:10:57,987 --> 01:10:59,011
Crys!

1148
01:10:59,555 --> 01:11:00,385
Shit!

1149
01:11:00,790 --> 01:11:02,382
Get out of my life, Moony

1150
01:11:02,592 --> 01:11:03,251
I'm not gonna do that

1151
01:11:03,459 --> 01:11:06,223
No, you don't understand
You have to leave, OK?

1152
01:11:06,462 --> 01:11:07,019
I'm not gonna do that, either

1153
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:08,821
Moony, turn around and walk away

1154
01:11:09,132 --> 01:11:10,190
Crys, I developed the film

1155
01:11:17,340 --> 01:11:19,205
Why? Why did you do that?

1156
01:11:19,509 --> 01:11:20,339
You gave them to me

1157
01:11:20,543 --> 01:11:23,410
No, I gave it to you...
because I knew you wouldn't develop it

1158
01:11:23,679 --> 01:11:24,805
You'd just throw it in the fishbowl

1159
01:11:25,048 --> 01:11:26,208
Until something happened to you!

1160
01:11:26,482 --> 01:11:27,244
Nothing's happened to me

1161
01:11:27,450 --> 01:11:28,849
Yes, it did! You met me!

1162
01:11:29,052 --> 01:11:32,215
Listen, Marquand died of
a drug overdose, right?

1163
01:11:33,089 --> 01:11:33,783
Yes

1164
01:11:34,791 --> 01:11:37,988
Graham killed Stone on the chance...
that you might have told him about it

1165
01:11:38,528 --> 01:11:39,324
Yes

1166
01:11:39,829 --> 01:11:41,296
Do they know about the pictures?

1167
01:11:41,898 --> 01:11:44,696
That's the only reason we're still alive

1168
01:11:45,601 --> 01:11:46,727
Has anyone seen them?

1169
01:11:46,936 --> 01:11:48,665
No, not yet, but I'm gonna take 'em down

1170
01:11:48,871 --> 01:11:49,530
Moon!

1171
01:11:49,739 --> 01:11:51,536
I know what you wanna do

1172
01:11:53,009 --> 01:11:54,271
You can't do it

1173
01:11:54,444 --> 01:11:56,036
What the fuck are you talkin' about?

1174
01:11:56,279 --> 01:11:57,473
Leave

1175
01:11:58,014 --> 01:12:00,847
And don't do anything...

1176
01:12:01,651 --> 01:12:02,675
please

1177
01:12:02,852 --> 01:12:03,682
Hey, listen to me!

1178
01:12:03,853 --> 01:12:04,979
Please, Moon!

1179
01:12:05,988 --> 01:12:07,148
Crys!

1180
01:12:07,423 --> 01:12:08,890
Go away!

1181
01:12:09,125 --> 01:12:10,217
They'll see you!

1182
01:12:10,927 --> 01:12:12,053
Listen!

1183
01:12:12,595 --> 01:12:14,028
I can help you get out of this!

1184
01:12:14,230 --> 01:12:16,198
No! We have a deal

1185
01:12:16,399 --> 01:12:17,525
You got a trap!

1186
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:18,489
He can see us

1187
01:12:18,768 --> 01:12:20,759
There's nothing you can do about it

1188
01:12:21,237 --> 01:12:25,196
Moon... nothing's the same

1189
01:12:26,509 --> 01:12:27,942
You see that?

1190
01:12:28,744 --> 01:12:30,143
Everything's gone

1191
01:12:30,313 --> 01:12:32,440
No! It's not gone

1192
01:12:32,715 --> 01:12:33,909
They'll kill me

1193
01:12:34,117 --> 01:12:36,745
No! I'm an accessory

1194
01:12:36,953 --> 01:12:38,648
I'll go to jail

1195
01:12:38,855 --> 01:12:40,618
Well, testify for immunity!

1196
01:12:41,357 --> 01:12:42,483
They'll find me

1197
01:12:42,658 --> 01:12:44,057
Look, I can protect you!

1198
01:12:44,927 --> 01:12:47,418
I don't care what happens to me

1199
01:12:47,597 --> 01:12:49,895
Well, who the fuck do you care for?!

1200
01:13:06,549 --> 01:13:08,346
This is my baby

1201
01:13:12,021 --> 01:13:13,579
He already lost his father

1202
01:13:13,756 --> 01:13:15,781
You want him to lose me, too?

1203
01:13:17,627 --> 01:13:18,719
Stone?

1204
01:13:22,365 --> 01:13:23,662
My God

1205
01:13:25,902 --> 01:13:30,339
I was pregnant
couple of months before he died

1206
01:13:33,309 --> 01:13:35,140
I never told him

1207
01:13:36,913 --> 01:13:37,880
Baby...

1208
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:42,107
I didn't want it to look like I was trying...
to force him into something

1209
01:13:42,685 --> 01:13:44,585
I want this baby

1210
01:13:45,254 --> 01:13:46,585
Hey, baby

1211
01:13:47,190 --> 01:13:48,316
Jesus

1212
01:13:49,792 --> 01:13:51,282
You wanted to marry him

1213
01:13:52,995 --> 01:13:55,020
Does that make a difference?

1214
01:13:55,531 --> 01:13:57,999
Oh, Jesus, he's so beautiful!

1215
01:13:59,035 --> 01:14:00,593
Thank you, baby

1216
01:14:00,803 --> 01:14:02,327
Hey... come...

1217
01:14:03,139 --> 01:14:04,902
Hey, hey, Moon, come on, hol...

1218
01:14:05,107 --> 01:14:06,165
Come on and hold him for me

1219
01:14:06,409 --> 01:14:07,808
Tell... you know, tell me how he feels

1220
01:14:08,744 --> 01:14:10,939
Come on, Moon
Tell me how he feels, huh?

1221
01:14:11,948 --> 01:14:12,972
Moon?

1222
01:14:14,817 --> 01:14:16,910
Hey, Moon, come on, tell me...

1223
01:14:18,921 --> 01:14:20,650
Hey, Moon, don't do this to me.

1224
01:14:21,290 --> 01:14:23,224
Come on, tell me how he's...

1225
01:14:23,659 --> 01:14:25,650
Moony, come on! Tell me how he feels!

1226
01:14:33,336 --> 01:14:34,360
Hey!

1227
01:14:36,606 --> 01:14:37,504
Moony!

1228
01:14:46,682 --> 01:14:47,649
Peisha

1229
01:14:50,019 --> 01:14:51,953
Ready to go get some Pampers?

1230
01:14:52,355 --> 01:14:53,379
Yeah, oK

1231
01:14:53,589 --> 01:14:54,578
Crys?

1232
01:15:02,665 --> 01:15:03,597
Sorry

1233
01:15:04,300 --> 01:15:05,892
That's OK, that's OK

1234
01:15:09,438 --> 01:15:10,530
Here, let me hold him

1235
01:15:10,740 --> 01:15:12,435
No... Come on

1236
01:15:13,409 --> 01:15:15,001
Oh, yeah

1237
01:15:16,646 --> 01:15:17,943
You're a big boy

1238
01:15:21,350 --> 01:15:24,877
I just got off the phone...
with Senator Marquand's people

1239
01:15:26,255 --> 01:15:27,779
They're very upset with me

1240
01:15:29,525 --> 01:15:31,356
Seems that someone from the
police department...

1241
01:15:31,627 --> 01:15:33,993
has pulled out the Senator's autopsy file

1242
01:15:35,097 --> 01:15:37,895
And that wouldn't happen
to be a Mr. Moony?

1243
01:15:39,001 --> 01:15:40,468
The jerk from last night?

1244
01:15:45,608 --> 01:15:48,042
Did you know he was a cop? Huh?

1245
01:15:48,244 --> 01:15:50,542
Did you? Did you know he was a cop?

1246
01:15:50,746 --> 01:15:53,681
Did you know your mommy was one
of his old roomies?

1247
01:15:54,717 --> 01:15:57,277
Did you? Did you know that?

1248
01:15:57,687 --> 01:15:59,746
At least that's what Peisha tells me

1249
01:16:01,090 --> 01:16:03,320
I just got some very good Mexican brown

1250
01:16:04,293 --> 01:16:05,885
I hope she didn't O.D.

1251
01:16:23,713 --> 01:16:24,839
You lied to me

1252
01:16:25,014 --> 01:16:25,878
What?

1253
01:16:26,649 --> 01:16:28,276
Hey, look, look, you never should've left

1254
01:16:28,551 --> 01:16:29,916
That's the bottom line, all right?

1255
01:16:30,119 --> 01:16:32,053
She wanted me to leave...
or weren't you listening?

1256
01:16:32,321 --> 01:16:33,345
The girl needs our help

1257
01:16:33,589 --> 01:16:34,749
Well, she don't need mine

1258
01:16:35,257 --> 01:16:36,884
The girl's in love with you, asshole!

1259
01:16:37,093 --> 01:16:37,582
Fuck off!

1260
01:16:37,793 --> 01:16:38,725
Yeah, well, fuck you!

1261
01:16:38,994 --> 01:16:39,858
She's in love with you!

1262
01:16:40,029 --> 01:16:41,894
What the hell has that got to do
with anything?

1263
01:16:42,164 --> 01:16:42,687
I'm dead now!

1264
01:16:42,932 --> 01:16:43,899
Like hell you are!

1265
01:16:51,874 --> 01:16:52,636
Shit!

1266
01:16:53,142 --> 01:16:54,507
What is this shit?!

1267
01:16:55,244 --> 01:16:57,303
Fucking gotta be some kind of curse!

1268
01:16:58,147 --> 01:17:00,081
Me and Rambis, man, fuck!

1269
01:17:00,249 --> 01:17:03,412
Ha! You work your ass off, for what?

1270
01:17:03,819 --> 01:17:04,979
Fuckin' what?!

1271
01:17:05,287 --> 01:17:07,084
I'm not good enough for Crys!

1272
01:17:07,323 --> 01:17:09,518
Even my own heart ain't good enough!

1273
01:17:09,759 --> 01:17:10,657
Shit!

1274
01:17:11,026 --> 01:17:12,459
Fuckin' white curse!

1275
01:17:12,795 --> 01:17:15,457
No, it's not! It's a black
fuckin' conspiracy!

1276
01:17:15,631 --> 01:17:16,427
A what?

1277
01:17:16,632 --> 01:17:18,156
You! You heard me!

1278
01:17:18,534 --> 01:17:20,001
You fuckin' people, you...

1279
01:17:20,169 --> 01:17:22,160
you creep up around and just
suck up to us!

1280
01:17:22,638 --> 01:17:24,503
You make us trust you...

1281
01:17:24,740 --> 01:17:27,208
and then you... all the time,
you're robbin' us blind!

1282
01:17:27,443 --> 01:17:28,102
Oh, we do that, huh?

1283
01:17:28,310 --> 01:17:30,073
You! You, you fuckin'...

1284
01:17:30,312 --> 01:17:31,210
Say it, Moony, say it!

1285
01:17:31,414 --> 01:17:33,848
Say it! Niggers, right? Coon, chinks!

1286
01:17:34,116 --> 01:17:35,378
Spics! Kike!

1287
01:17:35,684 --> 01:17:36,742
Mook!

1288
01:17:37,019 --> 01:17:38,782
Niggers! Niggers!

1289
01:17:38,988 --> 01:17:40,012
Niggers!

1290
01:17:44,927 --> 01:17:45,951
Moon?

1291
01:17:49,131 --> 01:17:50,257
Moon?

1292
01:17:51,033 --> 01:17:53,866
All right, just take... take it easy,
take it easy

1293
01:18:20,329 --> 01:18:21,853
Moony, that you?

1294
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:26,464
I know we've had problems, but...

1295
01:18:27,136 --> 01:18:30,128
I don't think rejecting my heart
is the answer

1296
01:18:30,306 --> 01:18:31,398
You agree?

1297
01:18:32,408 --> 01:18:34,501
Yeah, I mean, there's other ways...

1298
01:18:34,777 --> 01:18:36,074
we can vent our frustration

1299
01:18:36,412 --> 01:18:39,108
We could... we could go to
the amusement park, uh...

1300
01:18:39,381 --> 01:18:41,110
ride the bumper cars

1301
01:18:41,283 --> 01:18:43,012
Play Mike Tyson's video Nintendo

1302
01:18:43,285 --> 01:18:46,311
You could be Mike Tyson

1303
01:18:46,689 --> 01:18:48,384
I'll... l'll be the white guy

1304
01:18:49,925 --> 01:18:51,449
No, I wanna be Mike Tyson

1305
01:18:51,627 --> 01:18:53,060
Anyway, we can... ice hockey...

1306
01:18:53,262 --> 01:18:54,354
uh, full-contact karate

1307
01:18:54,563 --> 01:18:56,258
I mean, we're mature men, aren't we?

1308
01:18:56,599 --> 01:18:58,226
I think we should just...

1309
01:18:58,467 --> 01:19:00,162
just chalk this rejection episode...

1310
01:19:00,402 --> 01:19:02,165
up to a learning experience...

1311
01:19:02,404 --> 01:19:04,031
as something that will never
happen again

1312
01:19:06,342 --> 01:19:07,502
You do agree?

1313
01:19:09,545 --> 01:19:10,876
Oh, good

1314
01:19:12,014 --> 01:19:13,845
That makes me breathe a lot easier

1315
01:19:14,517 --> 01:19:16,348
Now we gotta do something about Crys

1316
01:19:17,253 --> 01:19:19,221
If Graham's suspicious, no telling
what could happen

1317
01:19:19,388 --> 01:19:20,514
Yeah, we better...

1318
01:19:20,723 --> 01:19:21,985
We gotta...

1319
01:19:22,591 --> 01:19:23,683
We gotta get her

1320
01:19:25,060 --> 01:19:26,789
Any ideas? Yeah

1321
01:19:27,229 --> 01:19:28,753
Wait a minute, let's not jump
to conclusions

1322
01:19:29,031 --> 01:19:30,430
That thing could be keeping us alive

1323
01:19:30,633 --> 01:19:31,691
My ass

1324
01:19:32,501 --> 01:19:34,025
Where's the fuckin' phone?

1325
01:19:34,336 --> 01:19:35,394
Who you gonna call?

1326
01:19:36,472 --> 01:19:37,769
Arnold Palmer

1327
01:19:38,140 --> 01:19:39,038
What?

1328
01:19:39,542 --> 01:19:42,033
Are you trying to screw up
my entire day?

1329
01:19:42,244 --> 01:19:43,506
I am rid of you, Moony

1330
01:19:43,679 --> 01:19:44,441
The shrink is gonna pull you...

1331
01:19:44,680 --> 01:19:46,944
and you are going to be out of my life
for good!

1332
01:19:49,151 --> 01:19:50,379
Not crazy?

1333
01:19:52,454 --> 01:19:55,321
Anyone who would think that
a U.S. Senator would o.d. On crack...

1334
01:19:55,591 --> 01:19:57,491
has got to be out of his damn mind

1335
01:19:57,693 --> 01:19:59,058
No, I don't believe it, either...

1336
01:19:59,194 --> 01:20:02,994
and besides, if you just had an attack...
you shouldn't even be on the telephone

1337
01:20:03,666 --> 01:20:04,758
Moon...

1338
01:20:05,034 --> 01:20:06,399
Moon, would you calm...

1339
01:20:06,569 --> 01:20:08,196
just calm down, all ri...

1340
01:20:08,470 --> 01:20:10,404
Iook, I will be there

1341
01:20:10,606 --> 01:20:12,540
I'm not supposed to take this out
of the building

1342
01:20:14,877 --> 01:20:17,368
Yeah, I... I remember the night
at the Bowl

1343
01:20:17,947 --> 01:20:18,845
Moon, don't...

1344
01:20:19,748 --> 01:20:21,010
don't tell my mother

1345
01:20:22,084 --> 01:20:23,415
Listen, hold on

1346
01:20:26,155 --> 01:20:27,747
OK, I'll do it, yeah

1347
01:20:28,824 --> 01:20:29,586
OK

1348
01:20:29,792 --> 01:20:31,282
Oh, and... and, Moon, um...

1349
01:20:31,527 --> 01:20:32,425
Someone the name of Crystal called...

1350
01:20:32,695 --> 01:20:35,892
and Terri said that she should call you
at home, OK?

1351
01:20:36,432 --> 01:20:37,524
Moon?

1352
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:38,994
It's Crys

1353
01:20:39,768 --> 01:20:43,534
Peisha and I are in serious trouble...
you understand?

1354
01:20:43,772 --> 01:20:46,332
And I need to see you, please

1355
01:20:46,575 --> 01:20:47,633
Oh, Jesus

1356
01:20:48,177 --> 01:20:49,474
What is it? What did she say?

1357
01:20:49,678 --> 01:20:52,010
They know, they're gonna kill her

1358
01:20:52,281 --> 01:20:56,047
We're gonna take little Leo to...
you know the World House?

1359
01:20:56,218 --> 01:20:58,209
It's up past the old swim club...

1360
01:20:58,487 --> 01:21:03,083
That used to be Needle Park
for the surf set

1361
01:21:03,292 --> 01:21:06,284
We'll wait for you there until eight

1362
01:21:06,495 --> 01:21:10,056
And after that, I... I don't know
what's gonna happen

1363
01:21:10,366 --> 01:21:11,094
Tell him about the pictures

1364
01:21:11,333 --> 01:21:13,563
You have to bring the pictures...

1365
01:21:14,970 --> 01:21:17,461
and come alone, Moon

1366
01:21:18,674 --> 01:21:20,403
Please, come

1367
01:21:21,243 --> 01:21:22,267
I love you

1368
01:21:23,545 --> 01:21:24,910
We got forty minutes

1369
01:21:25,381 --> 01:21:26,905
Jesus, they got my kid

1370
01:21:27,282 --> 01:21:28,249
Call the police

1371
01:21:28,717 --> 01:21:31,515
I'd waste forty minutes trying to
make 'em believe me

1372
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:33,051
I'll leave Harry a note

1373
01:21:39,361 --> 01:21:41,022
Two three nine, code blue, code blue

1374
01:21:41,363 --> 01:21:42,057
Two three nine

1375
01:21:43,866 --> 01:21:45,265
Grab ten ccs ccs!

1376
01:21:47,936 --> 01:21:49,563
I think they responded very well to that

1377
01:21:50,639 --> 01:21:51,503
Here

1378
01:22:04,987 --> 01:22:06,147
Hemorrhoids

1379
01:22:10,626 --> 01:22:12,093
Crude, but funny

1380
01:22:12,327 --> 01:22:13,294
Over there

1381
01:22:14,430 --> 01:22:16,193
A police car's a little obvious, isn't it?

1382
01:22:16,432 --> 01:22:18,400
We got thirty minutes
You wanna take a bus?

1383
01:22:18,901 --> 01:22:19,868
You sure you're gonna be OK?

1384
01:22:20,069 --> 01:22:22,094
If I'm not, you're gonna be
the first to know

1385
01:22:41,023 --> 01:22:42,718
The note says he's on his way to Malibu

1386
01:22:42,825 --> 01:22:44,224
Excuse me, I'm looking for Jack Moony

1387
01:22:44,460 --> 01:22:45,392
Who the hell isn't?

1388
01:22:45,828 --> 01:22:47,625
Yes, it's written to a guy named Harry

1389
01:22:47,830 --> 01:22:48,694
I'm Harry

1390
01:22:51,500 --> 01:22:53,263
You friend's lucky to be walking

1391
01:22:53,435 --> 01:22:55,528
How the deuce do you think he's gonna
get to the beach?

1392
01:23:02,644 --> 01:23:04,942
This is a little bit more excitement
than is called for in this situation...

1393
01:23:05,114 --> 01:23:05,808
don't you think?

1394
01:23:08,984 --> 01:23:10,952
He took the car because he needed it

1395
01:23:11,220 --> 01:23:12,084
You think he's gonna ask for it?

1396
01:23:12,254 --> 01:23:14,688
Look, I don't think you realize
just how serious his condition is

1397
01:23:14,857 --> 01:23:15,915
I realize it, I realize it

1398
01:23:16,158 --> 01:23:17,420
Harry! Harry...

1399
01:23:17,626 --> 01:23:19,184
Dillnick, what are you doing here?

1400
01:23:19,361 --> 01:23:21,727
Uh, Moon told me to bring
Marquand's autopsy file

1401
01:23:21,930 --> 01:23:23,522
Now, I know it's not supposed
to leave the precinct...

1402
01:23:23,766 --> 01:23:24,460
Son of a bitch!

1403
01:23:25,567 --> 01:23:26,499
What's going on here?

1404
01:23:26,802 --> 01:23:27,894
Holy shit

1405
01:23:28,103 --> 01:23:28,933
What?

1406
01:23:29,138 --> 01:23:30,537
They never even checked for drugs

1407
01:23:37,179 --> 01:23:38,168
Yeah

1408
01:23:40,048 --> 01:23:42,539
No, I'm certain I can arrange something
for you on Friday

1409
01:23:52,394 --> 01:23:53,383
Time check

1410
01:23:53,929 --> 01:23:54,861
Quarter to eight

1411
01:23:56,165 --> 01:23:57,097
You OK?

1412
01:23:57,733 --> 01:23:58,631
Yeah

1413
01:23:59,601 --> 01:24:01,831
Uh, I'm a little fuzzy

1414
01:24:04,773 --> 01:24:06,263
Did she ever read to you?

1415
01:24:06,975 --> 01:24:08,101
Yeah

1416
01:24:08,944 --> 01:24:11,139
Every Sunday morning
The funnies, you know?

1417
01:24:11,346 --> 01:24:12,506
Yeah? Yeah

1418
01:24:12,714 --> 01:24:13,942
Yeah, me, too

1419
01:24:15,117 --> 01:24:16,914
She'd start me out with Doonesbury

1420
01:24:17,119 --> 01:24:17,983
Peanuts

1421
01:24:18,220 --> 01:24:19,414
Yeah, figures

1422
01:24:28,463 --> 01:24:30,090
You should have married her, Moony

1423
01:24:30,966 --> 01:24:32,092
Yeah

1424
01:24:33,836 --> 01:24:35,167
We both should have

1425
01:24:42,144 --> 01:24:43,577
I don't give a damn what Wendt says

1426
01:24:43,812 --> 01:24:45,109
Meet me there with a chopper

1427
01:24:45,347 --> 01:24:47,281
You think he might suspend us, Harry?

1428
01:24:47,649 --> 01:24:49,446
Being a cop is like being a pitcher,
Dillnick

1429
01:24:49,751 --> 01:24:52,413
You want your strikes,
you gotta risk your balls

1430
01:25:03,265 --> 01:25:07,031
It really irritates me when people don't
check their answering machines

1431
01:25:07,269 --> 01:25:08,361
Well, shoot 'em up

1432
01:25:10,038 --> 01:25:11,096
Hold on

1433
01:25:11,807 --> 01:25:12,796
Take it easy, take it easy

1434
01:25:13,141 --> 01:25:14,631
This'll make you feel a lot better

1435
01:25:23,952 --> 01:25:25,476
Come on, we're out of here

1436
01:25:26,655 --> 01:25:27,679
Just give her half

1437
01:25:28,757 --> 01:25:30,622
Oh, God

1438
01:25:31,159 --> 01:25:33,024
You realize this is a setup, don't you?

1439
01:25:34,930 --> 01:25:36,056
Yeah

1440
01:25:37,032 --> 01:25:38,863
I realize this is a setup

1441
01:25:39,902 --> 01:25:42,427
Well, a good lawyer always makes sure
his clients are prepared

1442
01:25:43,472 --> 01:25:44,404
Yeah

1443
01:25:45,040 --> 01:25:46,098
I'm prepared

1444
01:25:46,642 --> 01:25:47,631
You OK?

1445
01:26:28,583 --> 01:26:30,278
You be the scout I'll be the scout

1446
01:26:39,695 --> 01:26:40,855
Hey, Stone

1447
01:26:45,434 --> 01:26:46,366
Thanks

1448
01:27:25,374 --> 01:27:27,035
Ah, there's nobody here

1449
01:27:28,377 --> 01:27:29,401
Shit

1450
01:27:33,315 --> 01:27:34,304
Moon?

1451
01:27:36,084 --> 01:27:37,676
Sunglasses and an uzi

1452
01:27:39,287 --> 01:27:40,481
Watch my back

1453
01:27:58,707 --> 01:27:59,696
You OK?

1454
01:28:00,642 --> 01:28:01,506
Yeah

1455
01:28:25,434 --> 01:28:26,731
Aw, Jesus

1456
01:28:28,136 --> 01:28:29,103
This is it

1457
01:28:33,809 --> 01:28:36,334
Teller's got Crys and... my son

1458
01:28:36,611 --> 01:28:37,737
The right side

1459
01:28:38,280 --> 01:28:39,508
Graham's on the left

1460
01:28:41,249 --> 01:28:42,739
I'll check the side rooms

1461
01:28:56,765 --> 01:28:58,733
Moon, I'm sorry

1462
01:29:01,436 --> 01:29:02,460
Hi

1463
01:29:03,238 --> 01:29:04,364
The side rooms are empty

1464
01:29:04,706 --> 01:29:05,832
I'll watch the door

1465
01:29:26,728 --> 01:29:28,286
Ain't love grand?

1466
01:29:28,530 --> 01:29:30,760
Cut the shit, I'm here

1467
01:29:31,833 --> 01:29:33,300
Now let the girls go

1468
01:29:33,602 --> 01:29:37,333
I'll forget about Marquand
and deliver the pictures

1469
01:29:37,506 --> 01:29:39,064
Moon, there's one coming up
behind you

1470
01:29:39,474 --> 01:29:40,532
He's got a big gun

1471
01:29:40,942 --> 01:29:43,001
That's the plan I had with the girls

1472
01:29:43,378 --> 01:29:44,402
Moon?

1473
01:29:44,913 --> 01:29:46,847
I don't like to make the same
mistake twice

1474
01:29:47,015 --> 01:29:47,743
