1
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:48,006
On Sunday, August 12, 1961...

2
00:01:48,007 --> 00:01:50,776
the eyes of America
were on the nation's capital...

3
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:54,447
where Roger Maris was hitting
home runs number 44 and 45...

4
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:55,948
against the Senators.

5
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:58,117
On that same day,
without any warning...

6
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:00,453
the East German Communists
sealed off the border...

7
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:03,256
between East and West Berlin.

8
00:02:03,257 --> 00:02:04,490
I only mention this...

9
00:02:04,491 --> 00:02:06,726
to show the kind of people
we're dealing with...

10
00:02:06,727 --> 00:02:08,994
real shifty.

11
00:02:08,995 --> 00:02:11,564
Having been stationed in Berlin
and having dealt with them...

12
00:02:11,565 --> 00:02:13,054
I know what I'm talking about.

13
00:02:13,933 --> 00:02:15,834
Let's go back to last June.

14
00:02:15,835 --> 00:02:18,705
Considering the abnormal
situation of a divided city...

15
00:02:18,706 --> 00:02:21,106
life in Berlin
was more or less normal.

16
00:02:21,107 --> 00:02:23,409
Traffic flowed freely
through the Brandenburg Gate...

17
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:24,944
and it wasn't really
too much trouble...

18
00:02:24,945 --> 00:02:26,479
to pass from one side
of the Iron Curtain...

19
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,779
to the other.

20
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,683
Some of the East German police
were rude and suspicious.

21
00:02:30,684 --> 00:02:33,051
Others were suspicious and rude.

22
00:02:33,052 --> 00:02:35,622
The eastern sector,
under Communist domination...

23
00:02:35,623 --> 00:02:37,156
was still in rubble...

24
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,592
but the people went about
their daily business...

25
00:02:39,593 --> 00:02:40,752
parading.

26
00:03:33,179 --> 00:03:34,846
These constant provocations...

27
00:03:34,847 --> 00:03:37,183
failed to provoke
the West Berliners.

28
00:03:37,184 --> 00:03:38,741
They were too busy rebuilding.

29
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:42,655
The western sector,
under Allied protection...

30
00:03:42,656 --> 00:03:44,623
was peaceful, prosperous...

31
00:03:44,624 --> 00:03:47,320
and enjoyed all the blessings
of democracy.

32
00:03:51,698 --> 00:03:53,098
Just by coincidence...

33
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:55,329
this happens to be
the company I work for.

34
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:13,916
Danke schn.

35
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,122
Danke schn, Fritz.

36
00:04:30,637 --> 00:04:32,195
Danke schn.

37
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:46,682
Danke schn already.

38
00:04:55,328 --> 00:04:56,761
Sitzen machen.

39
00:05:06,272 --> 00:05:08,035
Schlemmer!

40
00:05:12,178 --> 00:05:13,702
Good morning, Mr. MacNamara.

41
00:05:14,847 --> 00:05:16,515
Schlemmer, how many times
have I told you...

42
00:05:16,516 --> 00:05:17,984
I don't want those people
standing at attention...

43
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:20,286
every time
I come into the office.

44
00:05:20,287 --> 00:05:22,587
I know.
I've given strict orders.

45
00:05:22,588 --> 00:05:24,791
Can't they get it through
their Prussian heads?

46
00:05:24,792 --> 00:05:26,159
They're living
in a democracy now.

47
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,526
That is the trouble.

48
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:29,062
In the old days,
if I ordered them to sit...

49
00:05:29,063 --> 00:05:30,195
they would sit.

50
00:05:30,196 --> 00:05:32,031
Now with a democracy,
they do what they want.

51
00:05:32,032 --> 00:05:33,298
What they want is to stand.

52
00:05:33,299 --> 00:05:35,001
Next, any word yet
from the mayor's office?

53
00:05:35,002 --> 00:05:36,234
Yes, sir. Negative.

54
00:05:36,235 --> 00:05:37,469
They absolutely
will not permit us...

55
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:39,272
to install a Coke machine
in the Reichstag.

56
00:05:39,273 --> 00:05:41,139
Sometimes I wonder
who won the war.

57
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,375
Next, did you pick up
those airline tickets...

58
00:05:42,376 --> 00:05:43,443
for my wife and children?

59
00:05:43,444 --> 00:05:45,043
Yes, sir. Positive.

60
00:05:45,044 --> 00:05:46,713
Three seats on a 6:00 plane
to Venice.

61
00:05:46,714 --> 00:05:47,780
They change in Frankfurt.

62
00:05:47,781 --> 00:05:48,780
That reminds me.

63
00:05:48,781 --> 00:05:49,949
Call the Frankfurt plant
and have them ship us...

64
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:51,383
another 100,000 bottles.

65
00:05:51,384 --> 00:05:53,553
People keep smuggling Cokes
into the eastern sector...

66
00:05:53,554 --> 00:05:54,554
and not returning the empties.

67
00:05:54,555 --> 00:05:55,687
Yes, sir.

68
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:57,390
Next, I'm expecting the Russian
Trade Commission at 10:20.

69
00:05:57,391 --> 00:05:58,558
When they get here,
show them right in.

70
00:05:58,559 --> 00:05:59,558
Yes, sir.

71
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:00,693
Next. Schlemmer, you're fired.

72
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:01,626
Sir?

73
00:06:01,627 --> 00:06:04,029
Unless you stop clicking
your heels around here!

74
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,432
Yes, sir. Oh, I'm sorry.
I keep forgetting myself.

75
00:06:06,433 --> 00:06:07,833
That old Gestapo training, huh?

76
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:09,702
Please, Mr. MacNamara.
You mustn't say that.

77
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:10,702
It is not true.

78
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:13,106
Just between us, Schlemmer,
what did you do during the war?

79
00:06:13,107 --> 00:06:14,340
I was in der untergrund...

80
00:06:14,341 --> 00:06:15,341
the underground.

81
00:06:15,342 --> 00:06:16,341
Resistance fighter?

82
00:06:16,342 --> 00:06:17,710
No. Motorman.
In the underground.

83
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:18,744
You know, the subway.

84
00:06:18,745 --> 00:06:20,847
Of course, you were anti-Nazi,
and you never liked Adolf.

85
00:06:20,848 --> 00:06:22,147
Adolf who?

86
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:23,515
You see, down where I was...

87
00:06:23,516 --> 00:06:24,917
I didn't know what
was going on out there.

88
00:06:24,918 --> 00:06:26,302
Nobody ever told me
anything.

89
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,687
That'll be all, Schlemmer.

90
00:06:27,688 --> 00:06:29,052
Herausmachen!

91
00:06:58,017 --> 00:06:59,317
Guten Morgen, MacNamara.

92
00:06:59,318 --> 00:07:01,320
And a guten Morgen to you,
Frulein Ingeborg.

93
00:07:01,321 --> 00:07:02,320
It is not "frow-line."

94
00:07:02,321 --> 00:07:05,057
It is "froy-line"
with an umlaut.

95
00:07:05,058 --> 00:07:07,492
I'll say. Monthly report.

96
00:07:07,493 --> 00:07:10,062
To Wendell P. Hazeltine,
home office, Atlanta, Georgia.

97
00:07:10,063 --> 00:07:12,665
From C.R. MacNamara,
Berlin branch.

98
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:13,900
Production figures were made.

99
00:07:13,901 --> 00:07:15,967
270,000 cases.

100
00:07:15,968 --> 00:07:19,305
Consumption per capita
now 5.2% above last year.

101
00:07:19,306 --> 00:07:21,457
Outselling Rhine wine
eight to one.

102
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:23,609
Rapidly creeping up
on draft beer.

103
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,510
Next, publicity campaign...

104
00:07:25,511 --> 00:07:28,514
to reorient German
businessmen's lunch succeeding.

105
00:07:28,515 --> 00:07:31,684
27% now having Coke
with their knackwurst.

106
00:07:31,685 --> 00:07:34,085
Now, here's a real hot flash.

107
00:07:34,086 --> 00:07:36,456
We may become
the first American company...

108
00:07:36,457 --> 00:07:38,190
to crack the Iron Curtain.

109
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:40,293
I have started
preliminary negotiations...

110
00:07:40,294 --> 00:07:41,860
with a Russian representative.

111
00:07:41,861 --> 00:07:44,230
It looks most promising.
More later.

112
00:07:44,231 --> 00:07:45,219
Next...

113
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:47,766
what did you do
over the weekend?

114
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:49,669
Nothing.
I stayed home waiting for you.

115
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:50,920
I tried to make it, believe me.

116
00:07:50,921 --> 00:07:52,897
I just couldn't get away...

117
00:07:52,898 --> 00:07:54,874
but there's good news tonight.

118
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:57,343
Yes? Mrs. MacNamara?

119
00:07:57,344 --> 00:07:58,503
Put her on.

120
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:01,713
Yes, Phyllis.
What's the matter?

121
00:08:01,714 --> 00:08:03,916
It's Tommy. We're having
a little crisis here.

122
00:08:03,917 --> 00:08:05,817
Why don't you talk to him?

123
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:07,877
Tommy, your father's
on the phone.

124
00:08:09,555 --> 00:08:11,656
Hello, Dad. Nothing.

125
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:13,526
It's just that Mother's
ganging up on me.

126
00:08:13,527 --> 00:08:15,193
What do you mean by that?

127
00:08:15,194 --> 00:08:17,063
I think your mother's
absolutely right.

128
00:08:17,064 --> 00:08:18,330
It's silly to pack them.

129
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:19,732
What are you going to do
with roller skates in Venice?

130
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:20,932
All the streets are underwater.

131
00:08:20,933 --> 00:08:24,937
So what? I'm taking my aqualung
and my snorkel.

132
00:08:24,938 --> 00:08:27,770
Here. Your husband
wants to talk to you.

133
00:08:31,477 --> 00:08:32,544
Yes, Mac?

134
00:08:32,545 --> 00:08:35,031
Look, Phyllis.
Let him pack what he wants.

135
00:08:35,032 --> 00:08:37,516
All right. I'm spoiling him.
Big deal.

136
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,018
don't worry.
The car will be there at 5:00.

137
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:40,520
Then you'll pick me up
at the office...

138
00:08:40,521 --> 00:08:41,721
and I'll take you
to the airport.

139
00:08:41,722 --> 00:08:43,321
Yes, mein fhrer.

140
00:08:43,322 --> 00:08:44,457
Bertha wants to know
what you'd like...

141
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:45,675
to have for dinner tonight.

142
00:08:45,676 --> 00:08:46,835
Oh, tell her not to bother.

143
00:08:46,836 --> 00:08:47,993
I've got a desk full of work.

144
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:49,662
I'll just grab
a quick bite somewhere.

145
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:50,651
So long, dear.

146
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:53,198
Like I said, good news.

147
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:54,700
Your wife. She's making a trip?

148
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:55,834
Is she ever.

149
00:08:55,835 --> 00:08:57,436
Going on vacation
mit die Kinder.

150
00:08:57,437 --> 00:08:58,470
Ach so.

151
00:08:58,471 --> 00:08:59,905
So tonight,
we'll split a schnitzel...

152
00:08:59,906 --> 00:09:01,524
and start
on the German lessons again.

153
00:09:01,525 --> 00:09:03,141
We should.
You must be getting rusty.

154
00:09:03,142 --> 00:09:05,244
We'll just have to work at it
twice as hard from now on.

155
00:09:05,245 --> 00:09:06,245
Das ist gut?

156
00:09:06,246 --> 00:09:07,245
Sehr gut.

157
00:09:07,246 --> 00:09:10,149
And the first thing we're gonna
do is brush up on the umlaut.

158
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:11,446
Das ist wunderbar.

159
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,287
Like all the lilacs
in Lower Bavaria.

160
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:21,060
The Communist gentlemen
are here.

161
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:22,060
Send them in.

162
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:23,596
That'll be all,
Frulein Ingeborg.

163
00:09:23,597 --> 00:09:25,131
Put that on the teletype
to Atlanta.

164
00:09:25,132 --> 00:09:26,164
Jawohl.

165
00:09:26,165 --> 00:09:27,333
And take your gum.

166
00:09:27,334 --> 00:09:28,357
Jawohl.

167
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:36,809
Nice to see you again,
Comrade Mishkin.

168
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:38,043
Hey, Mishkin.

169
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:39,878
Ah, Mr. MacNamara...

170
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:42,248
I would like to present
Commissar Peripetchikoff...

171
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:43,883
Chairman of our
Trade Commission...

172
00:09:43,884 --> 00:09:44,950
and Comrade Borodenko...

173
00:09:44,951 --> 00:09:47,286
from the Soft Drinks
Secretariat.

174
00:09:47,287 --> 00:09:49,154
Sit down.

175
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:50,288
Sit down, boys.

176
00:09:50,289 --> 00:09:51,757
We have no objection.

177
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:53,224
Cigarettes? Cigars?

178
00:09:53,225 --> 00:09:54,527
Here. Take one of these.

179
00:09:54,528 --> 00:09:55,619
Thanks.

180
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:57,329
Made in Havana.

181
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:59,197
We have trade agreement
with Cuba.

182
00:09:59,198 --> 00:10:01,167
They send us cigars,
we send them rockets.

183
00:10:01,168 --> 00:10:02,334
Good thinking.

184
00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:03,436
Now, I understand
from Comrade Mishkin...

185
00:10:03,437 --> 00:10:04,821
that you guys are very keen...

186
00:10:04,822 --> 00:10:06,205
on getting Coca-Cola
into Russia.

187
00:10:06,206 --> 00:10:07,672
He is totally wrong.

188
00:10:07,673 --> 00:10:09,074
I did not say we are keen.

189
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:11,344
I said we are mildly interested.

190
00:10:11,345 --> 00:10:12,538
Nevertheless...

191
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,649
Comrade Mishkin suggested we
start with 6 bottling plants...

192
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:19,447
Moscow, Leningrad,
Stalingrad, Kiev...

193
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,322
You know something?
You guys got cheated.

194
00:10:23,323 --> 00:10:24,657
This is a pretty crummy cigar.

195
00:10:24,658 --> 00:10:26,157
Do not worry.

196
00:10:26,158 --> 00:10:28,592
We send them
pretty crummy rockets.

197
00:10:33,432 --> 00:10:35,534
As I was saying, six plants...

198
00:10:35,535 --> 00:10:37,470
Moscow, Leningrad, Stalingrad...

199
00:10:37,471 --> 00:10:39,405
Kiev, Kharkov, and Minsk, right?

200
00:10:39,406 --> 00:10:40,472
Totally wrong.

201
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:41,540
I never mentioned Minsk.

202
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:42,707
I said Pinsk.

203
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:44,776
All right.
Pinsk is in. Minsk is out.

204
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:47,346
Next, our contract will contain
the usual provisions.

205
00:10:47,347 --> 00:10:49,148
We supply the syrup,
you do the bottling.

206
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:50,148
Certainly not.

207
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:53,319
We make our own syrup.
You supply the formula.

208
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,619
Forget it, gentlemen.

209
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:55,987
That formula
stays in our vaults.

210
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:57,423
We give it to you,
first thing we know...

211
00:10:57,424 --> 00:10:58,891
the Chinese Communists
will have it.

212
00:10:58,892 --> 00:11:01,827
No formula, no deal.

213
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:03,428
OK. No deal.

214
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:04,963
We do not need you.

215
00:11:04,964 --> 00:11:07,600
If we want Coca-Cola,
we invent it ourselves.

216
00:11:07,601 --> 00:11:08,600
Oh, yeah?

217
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:10,753
In 1956, you flew
a bottle of Coke...

218
00:11:10,754 --> 00:11:12,905
to a secret
laboratory in Sverdlovsk.

219
00:11:12,906 --> 00:11:13,972
A dozen of your top chemists...

220
00:11:13,973 --> 00:11:16,609
went nuts trying to analyze
the ingredients, right?

221
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:17,842
No comment.

222
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:20,345
And in 1958, you planted
two undercover agents...

223
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:22,848
in our home office in Atlanta
to steal the formula...

224
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:24,000
and what happened?

225
00:11:24,001 --> 00:11:25,150
They both defected...

226
00:11:25,151 --> 00:11:27,153
and now they're successful
businessmen in Florida...

227
00:11:27,154 --> 00:11:29,588
packaging
instant borscht, right?

228
00:11:29,589 --> 00:11:30,922
No comment.

229
00:11:30,923 --> 00:11:32,958
Last year, you put out
a cockamamie imitation...

230
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:34,526
Kremlin Cola.

231
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,028
You tried it out in
the satellite countries...

232
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:37,930
but even the Albanians
wouldn't drink it.

233
00:11:37,931 --> 00:11:40,599
They used it
for sheep-dip, right?

234
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,900
No comment.

235
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:44,937
So either get down to business
or get off the pot.

236
00:11:44,938 --> 00:11:46,638
My dear American friend...

237
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:49,375
if we are to live together
in peaceful coexistence...

238
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:51,477
there must be a certain amount
of give-and-take.

239
00:11:51,478 --> 00:11:53,111
Oh, sure.
We give, and you take.

240
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:54,909
What is the matter?
You do not trust us?

241
00:11:55,981 --> 00:11:57,248
No comment.

242
00:11:57,249 --> 00:12:00,319
If you do not mind,
we'll have a little conference.

243
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,650
Help yourself.

244
00:12:19,004 --> 00:12:20,266
What is this?

245
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:24,375
My employees gave it to me...

246
00:12:24,376 --> 00:12:26,245
on the tenth anniversary
of the Berlin Airlift.

247
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:28,614
Comrades,
are we going to stand here...

248
00:12:28,615 --> 00:12:30,983
and listen to this
cheap propaganda?

249
00:12:30,984 --> 00:12:32,851
Relax, Boris.

250
00:12:32,852 --> 00:12:35,321
While they're putting
Uncle Sam in cuckoo clocks...

251
00:12:35,322 --> 00:12:38,323
we will put
Soviet cosmonaut on moon.

252
00:12:38,324 --> 00:12:40,960
OK. So you guys may be the first
to shoot a man to the moon...

253
00:12:40,961 --> 00:12:42,361
but if he wants
a Coke on the way...

254
00:12:42,362 --> 00:12:44,090
you'll have to come to us.

255
00:12:52,071 --> 00:12:54,373
All right.
We agree in principle.

256
00:12:54,374 --> 00:12:55,673
You supply the syrup.

257
00:12:55,674 --> 00:12:58,210
Next, the deal will be set up
on a royalty basis.

258
00:12:58,211 --> 00:12:59,611
Royalty?

259
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,397
In Russia,
we do not have royalty...

260
00:13:01,398 --> 00:13:03,181
not since we liquidate
the Czar.

261
00:13:03,182 --> 00:13:05,651
Nevertheless, you'll pay us
a percentage of the gross.

262
00:13:05,652 --> 00:13:06,818
- Money?
- Dollars.

263
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:09,522
Instead of dollars, you would
accept three-week tour...

264
00:13:09,523 --> 00:13:10,989
of Bolshoi Ballet.

265
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:13,025
Please. No culture, just cash.

266
00:13:13,026 --> 00:13:15,653
The ugly American.

267
00:13:16,996 --> 00:13:18,596
Next, once the plants are up...

268
00:13:18,597 --> 00:13:19,831
we reserve the right
of inspection.

269
00:13:19,832 --> 00:13:21,967
Of course, and we reserve
the right to veto.

270
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:23,002
Our inspections will be
entitled to...

271
00:13:23,003 --> 00:13:25,838
- We veto it.
- I thought so.

272
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:27,272
Forget details.

273
00:13:27,273 --> 00:13:28,607
You will draw up
temporary agreement...

274
00:13:28,608 --> 00:13:29,674
we will submit to Moscow.

275
00:13:29,675 --> 00:13:31,677
And I'll have to consult
with Atlanta, Georgia.

276
00:13:31,678 --> 00:13:32,977
When will papers be ready?

277
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:34,980
I'll put my secretary
right to work on it.

278
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:36,982
Your secretary?
She's that blond lady?

279
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:38,415
That's the one.

280
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,822
You will send papers
to East Berlin...

281
00:13:42,823 --> 00:13:44,756
with blond lady in triplicate.

282
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:45,891
You want the papers
in triplicate...

283
00:13:45,892 --> 00:13:47,226
or the blond in triplicate?

284
00:13:47,227 --> 00:13:48,693
See what you can do.

285
00:13:48,694 --> 00:13:50,763
We are staying
at the Grand Hotel Potemkin.

286
00:13:50,764 --> 00:13:52,832
OK. Now, how about
a little vodka and Coke?

287
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:53,965
No, thank you.

288
00:13:53,966 --> 00:13:56,836
We have emergency meeting
with Swiss trade delegation.

289
00:13:56,837 --> 00:13:59,238
They sent us
twenty carloads of cheese.

290
00:13:59,239 --> 00:14:01,640
Totally unacceptable.
Full of holes.

291
00:14:01,641 --> 00:14:02,629
Good-bye.

292
00:14:03,809 --> 00:14:05,709
See you around the campus.

293
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:24,029
Ring a ding ding.

294
00:14:33,973 --> 00:14:35,106
What is it, Schlemmer?

295
00:14:35,107 --> 00:14:36,574
It is the overseas operator.

296
00:14:36,575 --> 00:14:39,111
You are to stand by for a call
from Atlanta, Georgia.

297
00:14:39,112 --> 00:14:41,446
Atlanta? They must
have gotten my teletype.

298
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:43,349
I bet they're all worked up
about the Russian deal.

299
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:44,650
- It went good?
- Good?

300
00:14:44,651 --> 00:14:46,135
Look at this, Schlemmer.

301
00:14:46,136 --> 00:14:47,619
All virgin territory...

302
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,488
200 million thirsty comrades...

303
00:14:49,489 --> 00:14:51,356
Volga boatmen and Cossacks...

304
00:14:51,357 --> 00:14:53,492
Ukrainians
and Outer Mongolians...

305
00:14:53,493 --> 00:14:55,627
panting for the pause
that refreshes.

306
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:58,130
Do you realize what it means
if I could put this across?

307
00:14:58,131 --> 00:14:59,464
Your stock, it will go up.

308
00:14:59,465 --> 00:15:01,166
I'll go up
to the number-one job...

309
00:15:01,167 --> 00:15:02,868
head of all
European operations...

310
00:15:02,869 --> 00:15:04,068
headquarters in London.

311
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:05,704
May I be the first
to congratulate you?

312
00:15:05,705 --> 00:15:07,339
I should have had
that job five years ago.

313
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:08,373
I was all set for it...

314
00:15:08,374 --> 00:15:10,459
even bought myself
an umbrella...

315
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:12,544
but I got loused up
by Benny Goodman.

316
00:15:12,545 --> 00:15:13,611
Benny Goodman?

317
00:15:13,612 --> 00:15:16,381
I was in charge
of the whole Middle East...

318
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:20,085
nine countries, fifteen bottling
plants, all facing Mecca.

319
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:22,137
Goodman and his band
were coming through...

320
00:15:22,138 --> 00:15:24,398
on a goodwill tour
for the State Department.

321
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:26,658
20,000 people showed up
at the concert...

322
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:28,427
but Benny didn't
because his plane was delayed...

323
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:30,513
by a sandstorm,
so the mob rioted...

324
00:15:30,514 --> 00:15:32,598
and marched
on the American embassy...

325
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:34,032
so the police
turned them back...

326
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:36,126
so they burned down
the Coca-Cola plant.

327
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:37,769
You know it.

328
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,238
There was a big rhubarb
at the home office...

329
00:15:39,239 --> 00:15:41,140
and suddenly,
I was in the doghouse...

330
00:15:41,141 --> 00:15:42,874
exiled to South America...

331
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:44,910
schlepping that syrup
over the Andes...

332
00:15:44,911 --> 00:15:46,344
on llamas yet...

333
00:15:46,345 --> 00:15:47,713
while a bunch
of crew-cut kids...

334
00:15:47,714 --> 00:15:49,081
were being promoted
over my head!

335
00:15:49,082 --> 00:15:50,316
But you're in Berlin now.

336
00:15:50,317 --> 00:15:51,549
This is not the doghouse.

337
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:53,318
Yeah. I used to
have nine countries.

338
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:56,455
Now I've got half a city,
and that may blow up any day...

339
00:15:56,456 --> 00:16:00,024
but MacNamara rides again!

340
00:16:00,025 --> 00:16:01,894
I'll be
the white-haired boy now.

341
00:16:01,895 --> 00:16:03,963
I'm going all the way!

342
00:16:03,964 --> 00:16:06,030
Yes? It's Atlanta.

343
00:16:06,031 --> 00:16:08,200
Hello? Hello?
Mr. Hazeltine?

344
00:16:08,201 --> 00:16:09,600
Yes, I can hear you.

345
00:16:09,601 --> 00:16:11,436
I'm fine, Mr. Hazeltine.
How are you?

346
00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:13,238
Well, if you must know,
I'm miserable.

347
00:16:13,239 --> 00:16:15,040
Those damn magnolias
are in bloom again...

348
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:16,975
and so is my hay fever.

349
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,677
MacNamara, there's
something important...

350
00:16:18,678 --> 00:16:20,345
I'd like to discuss with you.

351
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:22,247
I thought you would,
Mr. Hazeltine.

352
00:16:22,248 --> 00:16:23,548
You got my teletype?

353
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:24,782
It's right here in front of me.

354
00:16:24,783 --> 00:16:26,485
Those figures from May
are not bad...

355
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:27,536
not bad at all.

356
00:16:27,537 --> 00:16:28,586
Thank you, sir.

357
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:30,154
And how about the Russian deal?

358
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:32,074
Napoleon blew it,
Hitler blew it...

359
00:16:32,075 --> 00:16:34,018
but Coca-Cola's
gonna pull it off.

360
00:16:34,019 --> 00:16:35,960
Forget it, MacNamara.
Forget it.

361
00:16:35,961 --> 00:16:37,896
We are not interested
in doing business...

362
00:16:37,897 --> 00:16:39,063
behind the Iron Curtain.

363
00:16:39,064 --> 00:16:41,199
We're not interested
in the Russian market?

364
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,735
I wouldn't touch the Russians
with a ten-foot pole...

365
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:45,788
and I don't want anything to do
with the Poles, either.

366
00:16:45,789 --> 00:16:47,840
But this could be the biggest
thing for the company...

367
00:16:47,841 --> 00:16:49,899
since we introduced
the six-pack!

368
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:53,512
Well, if it's against
front-office policy...

369
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:54,579
You're damn right...

370
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,115
but that's not what
I called you about.

371
00:16:56,116 --> 00:16:57,181
Look, MacNamara.

372
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:59,418
I'd like you to do me
a big personal favor.

373
00:16:59,419 --> 00:17:00,818
Yes, Mr. Hazeltine?

374
00:17:00,819 --> 00:17:02,021
You want me to ship
Mrs. Hazeltine...

375
00:17:02,022 --> 00:17:03,554
another set of Meissen china?

376
00:17:03,555 --> 00:17:05,657
No! It's about our daughter
Scarlett.

377
00:17:05,658 --> 00:17:07,759
She's seventeen now,
sweet girl...

378
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,095
fell in love with some
damn rock'n'roll singer.

379
00:17:10,096 --> 00:17:12,130
No. That was the one before.

380
00:17:12,131 --> 00:17:14,999
This is some pimple-faced
basketball player.

381
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,161
Anyway, we sent her off
on a little trip to Europe.

382
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:19,370
Where was I?

383
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:21,840
Daughter Scarlett, pimple-faced
basketball player...

384
00:17:21,841 --> 00:17:23,042
sent her to Europe...

385
00:17:23,043 --> 00:17:24,042
Oh, yes!

386
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:25,327
We had her spend
a couple of weeks...

387
00:17:25,328 --> 00:17:26,611
with our representative
in Rome...

388
00:17:26,612 --> 00:17:28,630
and a couple of weeks
with our man in Paris...

389
00:17:28,631 --> 00:17:31,008
and she's arriving
in Berlin this afternoon...

390
00:17:31,009 --> 00:17:32,914
so I'd appreciate it
if you and Mrs. MacNamara...

391
00:17:32,915 --> 00:17:35,035
Oh, we'd be delighted
to have her stay with us.

392
00:17:35,036 --> 00:17:37,156
It's just that
my family has made some plans...

393
00:17:37,157 --> 00:17:39,791
and I have a few plans
of my own.

394
00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:41,927
Well, if it's any sort
of imposition, never mind.

395
00:17:41,928 --> 00:17:43,561
I'm sorry I called you.

396
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:45,964
Well, actually, I wasn't
thinking of myself.

397
00:17:45,965 --> 00:17:47,765
It's your daughter
I'm concerned about.

398
00:17:47,766 --> 00:17:50,035
With the political situation
in Berlin the way it is...

399
00:17:50,036 --> 00:17:52,004
anything can happen anytime.

400
00:17:52,005 --> 00:17:53,004
Exactly.

401
00:17:53,005 --> 00:17:55,107
That's why I want you to take
especially good care of her.

402
00:17:55,108 --> 00:17:56,607
She's just a child, really...

403
00:17:56,608 --> 00:17:58,444
and I don't like her
to stay in a hotel alone...

404
00:17:58,445 --> 00:17:59,762
at a time like this.

405
00:17:59,763 --> 00:18:01,079
She's flying Pan Am.

406
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,660
The plane is due
in Berlin at 4:20...

407
00:18:03,661 --> 00:18:06,240
unless those damn Commies
shoot it down.

408
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,642
Here.
You give her the flowers.

409
00:18:30,643 --> 00:18:31,810
Oh, cut it out, Phyllis!

410
00:18:31,811 --> 00:18:32,977
What was I going to do?

411
00:18:32,978 --> 00:18:34,580
The boss asked me to look
after his only daughter.

412
00:18:34,581 --> 00:18:35,847
I can't disappoint him.

413
00:18:35,848 --> 00:18:37,182
What about
your only children...

414
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:38,316
and your only wife?

415
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:39,651
We were all packed
and ready to go.

416
00:18:39,652 --> 00:18:40,985
don't you think
we were disappointed?

417
00:18:40,986 --> 00:18:42,987
Believe me, Phyllis,
everybody's disappointed.

418
00:18:42,988 --> 00:18:44,389
We'll just have to put things
off a couple of weeks.

419
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:45,791
The roller skates
and the snorkel and the umlaut.

420
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:47,158
The what?

421
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:48,459
Right now, the important thing
is to make sure...

422
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,496
that the girl has a good time
so when she goes home...

423
00:18:50,497 --> 00:18:52,764
all she'll talk about
is our man in Berlin.

424
00:18:52,765 --> 00:18:54,265
It's such a nuisance.

425
00:18:54,266 --> 00:18:56,100
Tommy will have to move
into Cindy's room.

426
00:18:56,101 --> 00:18:57,903
Bertha will have to learn
how to cook sauerbraten...

427
00:18:57,904 --> 00:18:59,103
southern style.

428
00:18:59,104 --> 00:19:00,405
Come on, Phyllis.
Make an effort.

429
00:19:00,406 --> 00:19:02,032
Yes, mein fhrer.

430
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:18,524
Pardon me, is this the plane
from Paris?

431
00:19:18,525 --> 00:19:19,724
Oui, monsieur.

432
00:19:19,725 --> 00:19:21,410
Isn't there a Miss Hazeltine
among the passengers?

433
00:19:21,411 --> 00:19:23,095
There was a Miss Hazeltine
among the passengers...

434
00:19:23,096 --> 00:19:24,096
but we have lost her.

435
00:19:24,097 --> 00:19:25,096
You lost her?

436
00:19:25,097 --> 00:19:26,428
She has joined the crew.

437
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:37,700
Scarlett Hazeltine
if I ever saw one.

438
00:19:39,545 --> 00:19:40,945
Miss Hazeltine, I'm MacNamara.

439
00:19:40,946 --> 00:19:42,548
This is Mrs. MacNamara.
Welcome to Berlin.

440
00:19:42,549 --> 00:19:43,848
Hi there!

441
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:44,950
How was your flight?

442
00:19:44,951 --> 00:19:46,250
Just marvy.

443
00:19:46,251 --> 00:19:48,776
The boys let me
buzz Dusseldorf.

444
00:19:49,588 --> 00:19:51,000
May I have your hat?

445
00:19:51,001 --> 00:19:52,413
OK, fans. Drop them in.

446
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:55,227
Pick one, will you, please?

447
00:19:55,228 --> 00:19:56,227
I'm game.

448
00:19:56,228 --> 00:19:57,229
What does it say?

449
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:58,230
It says Pierre.

450
00:19:58,231 --> 00:19:59,230
That's me!

451
00:19:59,231 --> 00:20:00,298
Where do I come to pick you up?

452
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:01,365
- What's our address?
- Why?

453
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:03,936
Well, we just had this lottery,
and Pierre won me.

454
00:20:03,937 --> 00:20:04,936
Lucky Pierre.

455
00:20:04,937 --> 00:20:06,370
He's the navigator.

456
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:08,139
You better
change your course, Lucky.

457
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:10,475
You're way off the beam.
This way, Miss Hazeltine.

458
00:20:10,476 --> 00:20:11,944
Now just a darn minute.

459
00:20:11,945 --> 00:20:13,077
So long, fans!

460
00:20:13,078 --> 00:20:14,412
But that's not fair!

461
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:17,249
Madame, I appeal to you
as a woman.

462
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:19,218
As a matter of fact, you do.

463
00:20:19,219 --> 00:20:20,344
Au revoir.

464
00:20:21,153 --> 00:20:22,387
So you're gonna be like that?

465
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:23,387
Like what?

466
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:26,257
A company man like those
old poops in Rome and Paris...

467
00:20:26,258 --> 00:20:29,127
breathing down my neck
every minute, cramping my style.

468
00:20:29,128 --> 00:20:30,127
Look, Miss Hazeltine.

469
00:20:30,128 --> 00:20:31,563
You're underage,
and I'm under orders!

470
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:33,130
Europe-what a drag!

471
00:20:33,131 --> 00:20:35,633
I've done the Colosseum bit
and the Mona Lisa bit...

472
00:20:35,634 --> 00:20:38,136
but they never take me
to any of those marvy places...

473
00:20:38,137 --> 00:20:40,972
like the Lido
and the Crazy Horse and Le Sexy.

474
00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:43,208
I promise you, you'll have
a wonderful time in Berlin.

475
00:20:43,209 --> 00:20:44,242
That's why I came.

476
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:45,744
I hear this is
a real swinging town.

477
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:47,211
Where did you hear that?

478
00:20:47,212 --> 00:20:48,679
don't you ever
read the headlines?

479
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,382
Everybody says Berlin's
the hottest spot...

480
00:20:50,383 --> 00:20:51,916
in the world right now.

481
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:53,318
Would you care to make
a short statement...

482
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:54,620
for the American Forces
Network?

483
00:20:54,621 --> 00:20:55,686
Phyllis, please!

484
00:20:55,687 --> 00:20:57,489
We're a little late, folks,
so good night.

485
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:58,522
This your ticket?

486
00:20:58,523 --> 00:20:59,957
Fritz, with the luggage machen.

487
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:01,509
You'd better send
a cable to Tara...

488
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:03,061
and tell them
Scarlett's checked in.

489
00:21:03,062 --> 00:21:04,829
don't bother. Let them worry.

490
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:06,664
I didn't volunteer
for this trip.

491
00:21:06,665 --> 00:21:09,735
They deported me just to bust it
up between me and Choo Choo.

492
00:21:09,736 --> 00:21:10,819
Who's Choo Choo?

493
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:11,902
Choo Choo Babcock.

494
00:21:11,903 --> 00:21:13,437
I met him
in a telephone booth.

495
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:16,775
42 of us piled inside
to break the record.

496
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:18,342
Choo Choo and I
were on the bottom.

497
00:21:18,343 --> 00:21:21,113
By the time we got out,
we were engaged.

498
00:21:21,114 --> 00:21:23,114
That's a record, all right.

499
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:25,317
But Daddy didn't approve
because Choo Choo's folks...

500
00:21:25,318 --> 00:21:27,886
are from the wrong side
of the tracks...

501
00:21:27,887 --> 00:21:30,455
and let's face it,
my daddy's an S-N-O-B.

502
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:31,489
A what?

503
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:32,857
- A snob.
- Oh.

504
00:21:32,858 --> 00:21:35,093
Seventeen. Isn't that a little
young to be engaged?

505
00:21:35,094 --> 00:21:37,028
Oh, I've been
engaged four times.

506
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:39,759
All the women in our family
are sort of hot-blooded.

507
00:21:40,899 --> 00:21:43,200
What have we got here?

508
00:21:43,201 --> 00:21:46,305
Whatever it is, it's all ours
for the next two weeks.

509
00:21:46,306 --> 00:21:47,829
Isn't that marvy?

510
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:12,152
Schlemmer!

511
00:22:16,902 --> 00:22:19,071
I'm sorry. I will keep them
here after hours practicing.

512
00:22:19,072 --> 00:22:20,137
Never mind that.

513
00:22:20,138 --> 00:22:21,756
My chauffeur didn't
show up this morning.

514
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:23,375
Fritz? I will find out
what happened to him.

515
00:22:23,376 --> 00:22:24,543
I don't care
what happened to him.

516
00:22:24,544 --> 00:22:25,711
Find out what happened
to my car.

517
00:22:25,712 --> 00:22:26,795
Jawohl!

518
00:22:26,796 --> 00:22:27,878
I'm sorry.

519
00:22:27,879 --> 00:22:29,626
While they are
practicing not standing...

520
00:22:29,627 --> 00:22:31,374
I will practice
not clicking my heels.

521
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,489
Guten Morgen, Frulein Ingeborg.

522
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:38,489
Guten Morgen.

523
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:40,826
Like freshly baked pumpernickel.

524
00:22:40,827 --> 00:22:41,859
Here's your mail.

525
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:42,894
Here's your
"Wall Street Journal"...

526
00:22:42,895 --> 00:22:44,895
and here is my resignation.

527
00:22:44,896 --> 00:22:46,481
Resignation?
What are you talking about?

528
00:22:46,482 --> 00:22:48,275
Now you do not work me
overtime anymore.

529
00:22:48,276 --> 00:22:50,323
You do not take advantage
of me on weekends.

530
00:22:50,324 --> 00:22:52,370
You have lost all interest
in the umlaut...

531
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:55,140
so, obviously, my services
are no longer required here.

532
00:22:55,141 --> 00:22:57,059
You know my problem.
We have this houseguest.

533
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:58,976
You said she would
be in Berlin two weeks.

534
00:22:58,977 --> 00:23:00,746
Can I help it if she caught
the German measles?

535
00:23:00,747 --> 00:23:02,147
She's been here now two months.

536
00:23:02,148 --> 00:23:03,147
She likes it here.

537
00:23:03,148 --> 00:23:05,016
It's a damn nuisance, but what
am I gonna do, throw her out?

538
00:23:05,017 --> 00:23:06,150
Doesn't she have to go home?

539
00:23:06,151 --> 00:23:07,853
It's August.
Won't schools soon open?

540
00:23:07,854 --> 00:23:09,653
In Georgia? You never know.

541
00:23:09,654 --> 00:23:11,956
Come on. What is
this nonsense about quitting?

542
00:23:11,957 --> 00:23:14,826
I have had offers for many jobs.
After all, I'm bilingual.

543
00:23:14,827 --> 00:23:15,826
don't I know it.

544
00:23:15,827 --> 00:23:17,429
Remember that Russian
Trade Commission?

545
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:18,930
They keep calling me
all the time.

546
00:23:18,931 --> 00:23:20,131
They want me very badly.

547
00:23:20,132 --> 00:23:22,032
I'll bet,
those Siberian wolves.

548
00:23:22,033 --> 00:23:24,236
So you better
find yourself another girl.

549
00:23:24,237 --> 00:23:25,498
All right!

550
00:23:27,005 --> 00:23:28,495
Dictation.

551
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:34,346
Classified ad to run
in all Berlin papers.

552
00:23:34,347 --> 00:23:35,346
Quote...

553
00:23:35,347 --> 00:23:37,399
"Attractive
middle-aged executive...

554
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,693
"wants attractive,
young secretary.

555
00:23:39,694 --> 00:23:41,986
"Must be versatile
and cooperative.

556
00:23:41,987 --> 00:23:45,223
"Excellent salary,
congenial working conditions...

557
00:23:45,224 --> 00:23:47,358
"fringe benefits."

558
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:50,628
Fringe benefits? What is that?

559
00:23:50,629 --> 00:23:53,564
Little extras.
For instance, this morning...

560
00:23:53,565 --> 00:23:55,617
I was passing that fancy shop
on the Kurfuerstendamm...

561
00:23:55,618 --> 00:23:57,669
and there was this white
silk dress in the window...

562
00:23:57,670 --> 00:23:59,805
with polka dots all over it
and a matching hat.

563
00:23:59,806 --> 00:24:01,873
And a bag?
And matching shoes?

564
00:24:01,874 --> 00:24:03,741
Why not?

565
00:24:03,742 --> 00:24:04,743
I'll take the job.

566
00:24:04,744 --> 00:24:05,978
You got it.

567
00:24:05,979 --> 00:24:07,211
Danke schn.

568
00:24:07,212 --> 00:24:08,474
You're welcome schn.

569
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:14,013
Please. Not while
you're chewing gum.

570
00:24:18,256 --> 00:24:19,891
That'll be all,
Frulein Ingeborg.

571
00:24:19,892 --> 00:24:21,960
- More later.
- Anytime.

572
00:24:21,961 --> 00:24:23,127
Yes, Schlemmer?

573
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:25,263
I called the garage.
I called his wife.

574
00:24:25,264 --> 00:24:26,430
No Fritz.

575
00:24:26,431 --> 00:24:27,799
I can see this is going
to be one of those days.

576
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:28,900
You better call the police.

577
00:24:28,901 --> 00:24:29,900
I already did.

578
00:24:29,901 --> 00:24:31,503
Gave them a complete description
of the car...

579
00:24:31,504 --> 00:24:33,772
model, license number,
engine number.

580
00:24:33,773 --> 00:24:34,806
You're a good man, Schlemmer.

581
00:24:34,807 --> 00:24:35,806
Thank you, sir.

582
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:36,808
Schlemmer, how much
are we paying you?

583
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:37,808
Two hundred marks a week.

584
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:39,544
Let's see. That would be
about fifty dollars.

585
00:24:39,545 --> 00:24:40,879
- That's all.
- That's enough.

586
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:41,868
Yes, sir.

587
00:24:44,015 --> 00:24:46,317
Hello? Hello? Yes?

588
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:48,686
Atlanta, Georgia?
Put it through.

589
00:24:48,687 --> 00:24:50,789
MacNamara, what's going on
there in Berlin?

590
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:52,490
I have a letter here
from Scarlett.

591
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:55,927
It says she's been going
to operas, concerts, museums.

592
00:24:55,928 --> 00:24:57,928
That doesn't sound
like my little girl.

593
00:24:57,929 --> 00:24:59,965
You're going to be
surprised, Mr. Hazeltine.

594
00:24:59,966 --> 00:25:01,417
She's a different person now.

595
00:25:01,418 --> 00:25:02,867
I don't mind telling you.

596
00:25:02,868 --> 00:25:04,503
We were a little worried
when she first arrived...

597
00:25:04,504 --> 00:25:06,037
but she turned out just fine.

598
00:25:06,038 --> 00:25:08,372
Well, I'll be damned!

599
00:25:08,373 --> 00:25:09,773
Anyway, you'll be
relieved to know...

600
00:25:09,774 --> 00:25:12,344
that Mrs. Hazeltine and I
are leaving for Europe today...

601
00:25:12,345 --> 00:25:14,513
and we're going to take
Scarlett off your hands.

602
00:25:14,514 --> 00:25:16,165
We'll be sorry to lose her.

603
00:25:16,166 --> 00:25:17,815
No, it was no bother at all.

604
00:25:17,816 --> 00:25:20,085
Two weeks, two months.
What's the difference?

605
00:25:20,086 --> 00:25:21,218
Well, I want you to know...

606
00:25:21,219 --> 00:25:23,104
that we're mighty grateful
to you, MacNamara.

607
00:25:23,105 --> 00:25:24,990
Actually, the reason
I'm making this trip...

608
00:25:24,991 --> 00:25:26,991
there's gonna be
a shift in personnel.

609
00:25:26,992 --> 00:25:29,294
We're naming a new head
of European operations...

610
00:25:29,295 --> 00:25:31,730
and you won't be forgotten, Mac.

611
00:25:31,731 --> 00:25:33,531
The London job?

612
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:36,200
Well, I don't know what to say.

613
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:38,502
I never expected
anything like that.

614
00:25:38,503 --> 00:25:41,172
Just to be considered
for the job is a great honor.

615
00:25:41,173 --> 00:25:42,207
Of course, I have been
with the company...

616
00:25:42,208 --> 00:25:43,607
for the past fifteen years...

617
00:25:43,608 --> 00:25:46,144
and I know the European market
like the inside of my pocket...

618
00:25:46,145 --> 00:25:47,145
It's your wife
on the other phone.

619
00:25:47,146 --> 00:25:48,178
She must talk to you.

620
00:25:48,179 --> 00:25:49,497
Not now.
I'm on long distance.

621
00:25:49,498 --> 00:25:50,814
I told her that,
but she insists.

622
00:25:50,815 --> 00:25:52,283
Would you hold on a minute,
Mr. Hazeltine?

623
00:25:52,284 --> 00:25:55,014
There's a little emergency
in the accounting department.

624
00:25:56,121 --> 00:25:58,055
What is it, Phyllis?
What's so important?

625
00:25:58,056 --> 00:26:00,525
Well, if you put it that way,
nothing, really.

626
00:26:00,526 --> 00:26:01,825
I just thought
you might be interested...

627
00:26:01,826 --> 00:26:04,462
in what's going on
around the house, mein fhrer.

628
00:26:04,463 --> 00:26:05,729
You out of your mind?

629
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:08,066
I'm talking to Mr. Hazeltine
about the London job...

630
00:26:08,067 --> 00:26:09,466
and you want to chitchat?

631
00:26:09,467 --> 00:26:13,171
I'm sorry. It's just that
Miss Hazeltine is missing...

632
00:26:13,172 --> 00:26:14,873
but we can discuss it
some other time.

633
00:26:14,874 --> 00:26:16,840
- Bye.
- Bye.

634
00:26:16,841 --> 00:26:18,877
Missing?!
Wait a minute, Phyllis.

635
00:26:18,878 --> 00:26:19,977
Phyllis!

636
00:26:19,978 --> 00:26:21,312
What do you mean she's missing?

637
00:26:21,313 --> 00:26:23,882
Bertha took her breakfast up,
and she's not there.

638
00:26:23,883 --> 00:26:25,517
Her bed hasn't been slept in.

639
00:26:25,518 --> 00:26:26,584
Well, that's ridiculous.

640
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:27,819
We got back from the movie
around 11:00...

641
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:29,237
and Scarlett
went right upstairs.

642
00:26:29,238 --> 00:26:31,148
What could have happened to her?

643
00:26:31,149 --> 00:26:33,058
Who knows? Gone with the wind.

644
00:26:33,059 --> 00:26:34,224
Maybe she ran away.

645
00:26:34,225 --> 00:26:36,661
Maybe she was kidnapped
by a white slave ring.

646
00:26:36,662 --> 00:26:38,229
Oh, swell.
Hold on, will you?

647
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:39,296
Trouble?

648
00:26:39,297 --> 00:26:41,499
I wish I were in hell
with my back broken.

649
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:42,633
Sorry, Mr. Hazeltine.

650
00:26:42,634 --> 00:26:44,970
They come running to me
with all their little problems.

651
00:26:44,971 --> 00:26:47,339
About your trip.
What boat are you sailing on?

652
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:49,240
Boat? Who's got time for that?

653
00:26:49,241 --> 00:26:50,441
Mrs. Hazeltine and I...

654
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:52,243
are flying to New York
this afternoon...

655
00:26:52,244 --> 00:26:53,944
taking the overnight jet
to London.

656
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:55,880
There's a connecting
flight to Berlin...

657
00:26:55,881 --> 00:26:57,983
and we'll be there
at noon tomorrow.

658
00:26:57,984 --> 00:27:00,084
Noon tomorrow?
You mean our time?

659
00:27:00,085 --> 00:27:02,954
Of course I'll tell Scarlett,
first chance I get.

660
00:27:02,955 --> 00:27:03,954
Yes, sir.

661
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:06,024
We'll see you at the airport
unless those damn Commies...

662
00:27:06,025 --> 00:27:07,576
shoot the plane down.

663
00:27:07,577 --> 00:27:09,126
Yeah. Auf Wiedersehen.

664
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:11,429
For God's sake, Phyllis,
we've got to find that idiot.

665
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:12,998
Her parents are arriving
tomorrow.

666
00:27:12,999 --> 00:27:14,295
Where could she be?

667
00:27:14,833 --> 00:27:17,427
She doesn't know anybody
in Berlin except us.

668
00:27:18,436 --> 00:27:19,704
Well, have Bertha look again.

669
00:27:19,705 --> 00:27:21,489
Maybe she left a note.

670
00:27:21,490 --> 00:27:23,273
What about her luggage?

671
00:27:23,274 --> 00:27:25,377
I'm glad to hear
something is still there.

672
00:27:25,378 --> 00:27:27,478
No, I'm not blaming you.

673
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:29,514
It's just that lousy
MacNamara luck.

674
00:27:29,515 --> 00:27:31,160
First I lost a bottling plant...

675
00:27:31,161 --> 00:27:32,806
and now I lose
the boss' daughter!

676
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:38,223
I think
we are getting someplace.

677
00:27:38,224 --> 00:27:40,224
We found Fritz.

678
00:27:40,225 --> 00:27:42,292
Fritz? To hell with Fritz!

679
00:27:42,293 --> 00:27:44,460
It's the girl
we're looking for now.

680
00:27:44,461 --> 00:27:46,627
Precisely.
He has some information.

681
00:27:49,034 --> 00:27:50,200
Where is she?

682
00:27:50,201 --> 00:27:52,736
I do not know, not precisely...

683
00:27:52,737 --> 00:27:54,873
but last night, I dropped her
at the Brandenburg Gate.

684
00:27:54,874 --> 00:27:56,040
Brandenburg Gate? Why?

685
00:27:56,041 --> 00:27:57,608
That is where
I drop her every night...

686
00:27:57,609 --> 00:27:59,244
and that is where I pick
her up every morning.

687
00:27:59,245 --> 00:28:01,246
How long has this been going on?

688
00:28:01,247 --> 00:28:02,746
Since last month, sir.

689
00:28:02,747 --> 00:28:04,048
Usually, I get her
back to the house...

690
00:28:04,049 --> 00:28:05,350
before you wake up,
but this morning...

691
00:28:05,351 --> 00:28:06,684
I wait for her, and I wait.

692
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:08,586
You mean, you've been helping
her sneak out behind my back?

693
00:28:08,587 --> 00:28:10,555
Yes, sir, but I have
a very good excuse.

694
00:28:10,556 --> 00:28:11,555
What?

695
00:28:11,556 --> 00:28:12,656
She pays me
a hundred marks a night...

696
00:28:12,657 --> 00:28:14,559
fifty for driving her,
fifty for not telling you.

697
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,760
Do I have your permission
to fire him?

698
00:28:15,761 --> 00:28:17,094
Not yet!

699
00:28:17,095 --> 00:28:19,430
Now, let's go step by step.

700
00:28:19,431 --> 00:28:21,266
After you drop her
at the Brandenburg Gate...

701
00:28:21,267 --> 00:28:22,499
what does she do?

702
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:25,370
She crosses the border
into East Berlin.

703
00:28:25,371 --> 00:28:26,437
East Berlin?

704
00:28:26,438 --> 00:28:27,571
That is why I am so worried...

705
00:28:27,572 --> 00:28:29,507
because this morning,
she did not come back.

706
00:28:29,508 --> 00:28:30,908
You're worried?

707
00:28:30,909 --> 00:28:33,605
I'm going down in flames,
and he's worried.

708
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,098
Ingeborg, clear the switchboard.

709
00:28:37,099 --> 00:28:38,916
I want
Brigadier General Hartel...

710
00:28:38,917 --> 00:28:40,552
Commanding Officer
of the American sector.

711
00:28:40,553 --> 00:28:42,619
Next, get me Mayor Willy Brandt.

712
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:43,655
Next, get me
the Police Commissioner...

713
00:28:43,656 --> 00:28:44,888
of West Berlin.

714
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:47,425
Next, I want to speak
to the U.S. Ambassador in Bonn.

715
00:28:47,426 --> 00:28:48,949
You got that? OK.

716
00:28:50,161 --> 00:28:52,280
Fritz, you wait downstairs.
I may need you later.

717
00:28:52,281 --> 00:28:54,399
Schlemmer, how can we find out
what happened to her?

718
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,284
Can we get any information
from East Berlin?

719
00:28:56,285 --> 00:28:58,169
Only through official channels
in triplicate.

720
00:28:58,170 --> 00:28:59,204
What if we just
picked up the phone...

721
00:28:59,205 --> 00:29:00,238
and called the authorities
over there?

722
00:29:00,239 --> 00:29:02,272
- It is not that easy.
- Why not?

723
00:29:02,273 --> 00:29:04,342
There's no direct phone service
to East Berlin.

724
00:29:04,343 --> 00:29:05,342
You have to call Stockholm.

725
00:29:05,343 --> 00:29:06,861
From there it goes
through Warsaw...

726
00:29:06,862 --> 00:29:08,378
to Leipzig,
then to East Berlin.

727
00:29:08,379 --> 00:29:10,415
Nine times out of ten,
you get the wrong number.

728
00:29:10,416 --> 00:29:12,144
- Try it anyway.
- Yes, sir.

729
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:18,244
Schnellmachen!

730
00:29:21,626 --> 00:29:23,193
Yes?

731
00:29:23,194 --> 00:29:25,363
General Hartel
is out on army maneuvers?

732
00:29:25,364 --> 00:29:27,532
Well, what about
Mayor Willy Brandt?

733
00:29:27,533 --> 00:29:28,950
He's watching the maneuvers.

734
00:29:28,951 --> 00:29:30,367
And the Police Commissioner?

735
00:29:30,368 --> 00:29:31,770
I see.
He's watching Willy Brandt.

736
00:29:31,771 --> 00:29:33,739
So who's minding the store?

737
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:35,706
What about the call to Bonn?

738
00:29:35,707 --> 00:29:38,376
Our ambassador is back
in Washington for consulation?

739
00:29:38,377 --> 00:29:39,861
Come in, come in.
I'll be right with you.

740
00:29:39,862 --> 00:29:41,346
Get me Washington,
the State Department...

741
00:29:41,347 --> 00:29:42,579
whoever answers...

742
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:44,716
Dean Rusk, Dean Acheson,
Dean anybody.

743
00:29:44,717 --> 00:29:46,151
And if you have no luck there...

744
00:29:46,152 --> 00:29:47,584
get me Senator Talmadge
of Georgia.

745
00:29:47,585 --> 00:29:50,850
If he isn't in,
try Huntley and Brinkley at NBC.

746
00:29:51,723 --> 00:29:52,990
Scarlett!

747
00:29:52,991 --> 00:29:54,893
What's all the excitement?

748
00:29:54,894 --> 00:29:57,161
Oh, nothing.

749
00:29:57,162 --> 00:29:58,696
You just scared
the hell out of us!

750
00:29:58,697 --> 00:30:00,131
You all right?

751
00:30:00,132 --> 00:30:01,565
I'm just marvy.

752
00:30:01,566 --> 00:30:02,934
What were you doing
in East Berlin?

753
00:30:02,935 --> 00:30:04,653
You mean, last night?

754
00:30:04,654 --> 00:30:06,370
I mean all those nights.

755
00:30:06,371 --> 00:30:08,740
There's this boy
over there.

756
00:30:08,741 --> 00:30:10,073
Wow!

757
00:30:10,074 --> 00:30:11,709
What boy?
What have you been up to?

758
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:14,111
I met him
about six weeks ago.

759
00:30:14,112 --> 00:30:16,614
I went into East Berlin,
and there was this parade...

760
00:30:16,615 --> 00:30:18,349
and they wanted to arrest me.

761
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:19,883
Arrest you?

762
00:30:19,884 --> 00:30:21,752
Because I was taking pictures.

763
00:30:21,753 --> 00:30:24,621
And then this boy-
he was in the parade...

764
00:30:24,622 --> 00:30:26,690
he said to the policemen
I shouldn't be arrested.

765
00:30:26,691 --> 00:30:30,829
I should be pitied because I was
a typical bourgeois parasite...

766
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:34,866
and the rotten fruit
of a corrupt civilization.

767
00:30:34,867 --> 00:30:37,402
So naturally,
I fell in love with him.

768
00:30:37,403 --> 00:30:39,036
Naturally.

769
00:30:39,037 --> 00:30:40,772
Want to see his picture?

770
00:30:40,773 --> 00:30:41,905
Not particularly.

771
00:30:41,906 --> 00:30:43,965
I want your honest opinion.

772
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:48,908
Isn't he beautiful?

773
00:30:49,581 --> 00:30:52,349
You fell in love
with Khrushchev?

774
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:56,154
No, silly, the one
that's carrying Khrushchev.

775
00:30:56,155 --> 00:30:58,188
His name's Otto.

776
00:30:58,189 --> 00:31:00,258
I finally got
East Berlin on the phone...

777
00:31:00,259 --> 00:31:02,327
and just like I told you,
wrong number.

778
00:31:02,328 --> 00:31:03,727
Hi there.

779
00:31:03,728 --> 00:31:05,028
Now, you and this Otto...

780
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:07,332
exactly what do you do
when you're together?

781
00:31:07,333 --> 00:31:09,233
All kinds of goodies.

782
00:31:09,234 --> 00:31:12,135
I wash his shirts,
and he broadens my mind...

783
00:31:12,136 --> 00:31:14,806
and if it's a warm night,
we go lie on the roof...

784
00:31:14,807 --> 00:31:17,342
and watch the Sputniks go by.

785
00:31:17,343 --> 00:31:18,442
Is that all?

786
00:31:18,443 --> 00:31:21,379
Well, last night,
we were blowing up balloons.

787
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:22,695
Balloons?

788
00:31:22,696 --> 00:31:24,011
You know.

789
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:28,118
It's a Communist trick!

790
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:30,488
When the wind is right,
they float them across...

791
00:31:30,489 --> 00:31:32,012
to undermine our morale.

792
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:35,259
"Yankee go home"?

793
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:38,363
They come in all colors-
green and yellow and blue.

794
00:31:38,364 --> 00:31:39,364
You've been helping
this guy to spread...

795
00:31:39,365 --> 00:31:40,898
anti-American propaganda?

796
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:44,134
It's not anti-American.
It's anti-Yankee.

797
00:31:44,135 --> 00:31:47,638
Where I come from,
everybody's against the Yankees.

798
00:31:47,639 --> 00:31:49,574
I have good mind to change
this to "Russki go home"...

799
00:31:49,575 --> 00:31:51,610
and when the wind blows
the other way...

800
00:31:51,611 --> 00:31:53,644
You listen to me,
Scarlett Hazeltine.

801
00:31:53,645 --> 00:31:55,045
There's gonna be no more
of this foolishness...

802
00:31:55,046 --> 00:31:57,649
because tomorrow, your parents
are coming to take you home.

803
00:31:57,650 --> 00:31:58,911
They are?

804
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:03,086
Who? Chet Huntley?

805
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:04,322
All right. I'll speak to him.

806
00:32:04,323 --> 00:32:05,455
Hello, Mr. Huntley.

807
00:32:05,456 --> 00:32:06,958
I just want to tell you
I've been watching your program.

808
00:32:06,959 --> 00:32:08,360
Keep up the good work. Bye!

809
00:32:08,361 --> 00:32:09,760
When your parents arrive...

810
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:11,596
I want you to keep
your mouth shut...

811
00:32:11,597 --> 00:32:13,196
for your sake and mine.

812
00:32:13,197 --> 00:32:15,199
If they ever find out
what's been going on...

813
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,701
I better
talk this over with Otto.

814
00:32:16,702 --> 00:32:17,734
Oh, no, you don't!

815
00:32:17,735 --> 00:32:18,936
You're not gonna
see him again...

816
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:20,672
and you're not going
back to East Berlin.

817
00:32:20,673 --> 00:32:22,799
He's right downstairs.

818
00:32:24,342 --> 00:32:25,468
Otto!

819
00:32:27,478 --> 00:32:29,776
Otto, darling!

820
00:32:30,815 --> 00:32:32,442
Up here.

821
00:32:34,152 --> 00:32:36,416
Come on up, Liebchen.

822
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:42,459
Liebchen?

823
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:44,461
I don't want that creep
in my office.

824
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:46,764
Why don't you send him home
to clean out his cage?

825
00:32:46,765 --> 00:32:47,764
I think he better be here...

826
00:32:47,765 --> 00:32:50,134
because we have
something to tell you.

827
00:32:50,135 --> 00:32:51,802
Tell me what?

828
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:53,137
You're not engaged again,
are you?

829
00:32:53,138 --> 00:32:54,438
No, not this time.

830
00:32:54,439 --> 00:32:55,806
- Thank God.
- We're married.

831
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:57,104
For a minute there,
I was afraid...

832
00:32:58,543 --> 00:32:59,576
You're married?

833
00:32:59,577 --> 00:33:01,913
It will be six weeks on Monday.

834
00:33:01,914 --> 00:33:03,313
You married a Communist?

835
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:05,566
He's not a Communist.
He's a republican.

836
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:07,819
He comes from
the Republic of East Germany.

837
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:10,405
Why, you dumb,
stupid little pot!

838
00:33:10,406 --> 00:33:12,532
Do you realize what you've done?

839
00:33:12,533 --> 00:33:14,658
You've ruined me, that's all.

840
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:16,227
What are your parents
going to say?

841
00:33:16,228 --> 00:33:17,794
They trusted me,
and I trusted you.

842
00:33:17,795 --> 00:33:20,598
Then you go and pull
an idiotic stunt like this.

843
00:33:20,599 --> 00:33:23,066
Why didn't you
look after me better?

844
00:33:23,067 --> 00:33:25,937
Fifteen years with the company
down the drain.

845
00:33:25,938 --> 00:33:27,389
I'll be blacklisted.

846
00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:28,839
My kids will starve.

847
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,540
My wife will be selling pencils!

848
00:33:30,541 --> 00:33:32,702
And all on account
of you and your hot blood.

849
00:33:34,779 --> 00:33:37,373
Come in. Come in, Otto.

850
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:44,955
This is Mr. MacNamara.

851
00:33:44,956 --> 00:33:47,825
My husband-
Otto Ludwig Piffl.

852
00:33:47,826 --> 00:33:50,692
Piffl? Wouldn't you know.

853
00:33:54,932 --> 00:33:56,634
Where did you dig him up?

854
00:33:56,635 --> 00:33:58,515
He doesn't even wear socks.

855
00:33:58,516 --> 00:34:00,395
He doesn't wear shorts, either.

856
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:03,064
Isn't that exciting?

857
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:06,744
Take your cap off.

858
00:34:06,745 --> 00:34:07,744
Why?

859
00:34:07,745 --> 00:34:09,679
Because I said so.

860
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:13,417
In Lenin's tomb,
I take my cap off.

861
00:34:13,418 --> 00:34:15,620
If Van Cliburn
plays Tchaikovsky...

862
00:34:15,621 --> 00:34:17,154
I take my cap off...

863
00:34:17,155 --> 00:34:20,324
but in Coca-Cola office, phooey!

864
00:34:20,325 --> 00:34:23,494
Do it for me,
you little darling.

865
00:34:23,495 --> 00:34:25,195
For you, I do it.

866
00:34:25,196 --> 00:34:26,897
He could use a haircut...

867
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:28,266
and I'd like
to give it to him myself...

868
00:34:28,267 --> 00:34:29,967
with a hammer and sickle.

869
00:34:29,968 --> 00:34:30,967
Warmonger.

870
00:34:30,968 --> 00:34:31,968
Shut up, you punk.

871
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:33,571
don't you talk like that
to my husband.

872
00:34:33,572 --> 00:34:34,638
He's not your husband!

873
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:36,540
In the first place,
she's underage.

874
00:34:36,541 --> 00:34:39,110
Next, we don't recognize
the government of East Germany.

875
00:34:39,111 --> 00:34:41,679
Next, she admits that while she
was washing your shirts...

876
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,381
you were washing her brain!

877
00:34:43,382 --> 00:34:45,082
So the whole thing is illegal.

878
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:47,435
No, it's not.
I have a certificate.

879
00:34:47,436 --> 00:34:49,786
And tell him
about the wedding rings.

880
00:34:49,787 --> 00:34:51,889
Forged from the steel
of a brave cannon...

881
00:34:51,890 --> 00:34:54,257
that fought at Stalingrad.

882
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:55,660
I don't care
who your jeweler is!

883
00:34:55,661 --> 00:34:57,162
The marriage is illegal.

884
00:34:57,163 --> 00:34:58,662
You say, but in the eyes...

885
00:34:58,663 --> 00:35:00,398
of the People's Republic
of East Germany...

886
00:35:00,399 --> 00:35:01,598
we are husband and wife.

887
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:03,133
You are not in East Germany now.

888
00:35:03,134 --> 00:35:05,236
You are in West Berlin,
and I can have you arrested...

889
00:35:05,237 --> 00:35:07,689
for Iying on rooftops
with a minor.

890
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:10,140
Of course you can.
I know your tactics.

891
00:35:10,141 --> 00:35:12,109
You can have me arrested.
You can have tortured.

892
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:15,113
You can have me shot like you've
been doing in the Congo!

893
00:35:15,114 --> 00:35:17,104
Africa for the Africans!

894
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:19,583
All I want from you,
Scarlett Piffl...

895
00:35:19,584 --> 00:35:21,514
is silence
and damn little of that.

896
00:35:21,515 --> 00:35:23,444
don't you talk like that
to my wife!

897
00:35:24,522 --> 00:35:26,423
Who? Brinkley?

898
00:35:26,424 --> 00:35:28,790
Well, tell him I already
gave the message to Huntley.

899
00:35:30,895 --> 00:35:32,829
Look, Otto baby.

900
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:34,899
If we're to live together
in peaceful coexistence...

901
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:36,968
there must be a certain amount
of give-and-take.

902
00:35:36,969 --> 00:35:38,636
How'd you like a thousand marks?

903
00:35:38,637 --> 00:35:39,903
For what?

904
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:41,906
Just get on your motorcycle,
go back where you came from...

905
00:35:41,907 --> 00:35:42,940
and forget
about the whole thing.

906
00:35:42,941 --> 00:35:44,709
You can't bribe him.

907
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:45,775
Two thousand?

908
00:35:45,776 --> 00:35:46,860
How about five thousand?

909
00:35:46,861 --> 00:35:48,070
Otto, what are you saying?

910
00:35:48,071 --> 00:35:49,279
OK. Five thousand marks.

911
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,649
If it's worth five thousand,
why not fifty thousand?

912
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:53,640
Fifty thousand? You crazy?

913
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:56,587
I just want to see
how far they will go...

914
00:35:56,588 --> 00:35:58,856
to break up a happy
Socialist marriage.

915
00:35:58,857 --> 00:36:00,475
I spit on your money.

916
00:36:00,476 --> 00:36:02,385
I spit on Fort Knox!

917
00:36:02,386 --> 00:36:04,294
I spit on Wall Street!

918
00:36:04,295 --> 00:36:06,230
Unsanitary little jerk,
isn't he?

919
00:36:06,231 --> 00:36:07,949
You and your kind are doomed.

920
00:36:07,950 --> 00:36:09,559
We will take over West Berlin.

921
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,169
We will take over
Western Europe.

922
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:12,435
We will bury you!

923
00:36:12,436 --> 00:36:15,439
Do me a favor.
Bury us, but don't marry us.

924
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:18,875
Look at all this waste.

925
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:23,347
Capitalism is like
a dead herring in the moonlight.

926
00:36:23,348 --> 00:36:25,749
It shines, but it stinks!

927
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:28,685
He talks like that all the time.

928
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:30,888
Tell him about
Coca-Cola colonialism.

929
00:36:30,889 --> 00:36:31,888
What?

930
00:36:31,889 --> 00:36:33,323
As chairman Khrushchev said...

931
00:36:33,324 --> 00:36:35,525
on the 40th anniversary
of the revolution...

932
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:38,791
To hell with the revolution
and to hell with Khrushchev!

933
00:36:40,498 --> 00:36:42,762
The hell with Frank Sinatra.

934
00:36:43,401 --> 00:36:45,069
Oh, it's gonna be
a real clambake...

935
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:46,737
when your folks
get here tomorrow.

936
00:36:46,738 --> 00:36:48,972
How are we gonna explain this?

937
00:36:48,973 --> 00:36:52,076
That's your problem
because I won't be here.

938
00:36:52,077 --> 00:36:53,710
What do you mean,
you won't be here?

939
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:56,647
Tonight, my wife and I
are leaving for Moscow.

940
00:36:56,648 --> 00:36:58,481
Moscow?

941
00:36:58,482 --> 00:37:01,285
That's what I came to tell you.
He's got a scholarship...

942
00:37:01,286 --> 00:37:03,671
to the People's
Technological Institute.

943
00:37:03,672 --> 00:37:06,057
He's studying to be
a missile engineer.

944
00:37:06,058 --> 00:37:07,649
Soviet missiles...

945
00:37:08,859 --> 00:37:10,760
Venus!

946
00:37:10,761 --> 00:37:12,092
American missiles...

947
00:37:12,997 --> 00:37:15,056
Miami Beach.

948
00:37:17,435 --> 00:37:21,806
So you just tell Daddy
I'm on my way to the U.S.S.R.

949
00:37:21,807 --> 00:37:23,967
That's short for Russia.

950
00:37:26,344 --> 00:37:28,496
Are you out of your
seventeen-year-old mind?

951
00:37:28,497 --> 00:37:30,648
Russia's to get out of,
not to get into.

952
00:37:30,649 --> 00:37:32,400
Where Otto goes, I go!

953
00:37:32,401 --> 00:37:34,027
You just try to stop us.

954
00:37:34,028 --> 00:37:35,652
Can you talk to your wife?

955
00:37:35,653 --> 00:37:37,755
Well, I certainly
can't talk to them.

956
00:37:37,756 --> 00:37:38,881
On this phone.

957
00:37:41,192 --> 00:37:42,727
Hello? Yes, dear.

958
00:37:42,728 --> 00:37:44,261
Mac, hold everything.

959
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:45,896
I bet I know
what happened to Scarlett.

960
00:37:45,897 --> 00:37:48,498
Lucky Pierre
must be back in town.

961
00:37:48,499 --> 00:37:51,936
It's not Lucky Pierre.
It's Crazy Otto.

962
00:37:51,937 --> 00:37:53,003
Are you ready for this?

963
00:37:53,004 --> 00:37:55,472
She's married. That's right.

964
00:37:55,473 --> 00:37:57,441
She got herself an ever-loving,
curly-haired...

965
00:37:57,442 --> 00:37:59,272
card-carrying husband.

966
00:38:00,411 --> 00:38:02,641
She married a Communist?

967
00:38:03,147 --> 00:38:05,763
This is gonna be the biggest
thing to hit Atlanta...

968
00:38:05,764 --> 00:38:08,379
since General Sherman
threw that little barbecue.

969
00:38:09,086 --> 00:38:10,644
No, I don't think it's funny.

970
00:38:11,222 --> 00:38:14,792
They're gonna live in Moscow?
Now, that's funny.

971
00:38:14,793 --> 00:38:17,261
Yeah, hysterical,
but what can I do...

972
00:38:17,262 --> 00:38:18,713
go fight the Kremlin?

973
00:38:18,714 --> 00:38:20,163
I can't stop them.

974
00:38:20,164 --> 00:38:21,731
They're young,
they're in love...

975
00:38:21,732 --> 00:38:24,234
and we're a dead herring
in the moonlight...

976
00:38:24,235 --> 00:38:28,005
so who am I to stand in the way
of a happy Socialist marriage?

977
00:38:28,006 --> 00:38:30,024
Oh, come off it, Mac.
I know you.

978
00:38:30,025 --> 00:38:32,043
You've got something
up your sleeve.

979
00:38:32,044 --> 00:38:35,171
I wouldn't be surprised. Bye.

980
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:38,349
Now, what time
are you kids leaving?

981
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:40,101
7:00 on the Moscow Express.

982
00:38:40,102 --> 00:38:41,851
Why do you want to know?

983
00:38:41,852 --> 00:38:43,787
Because I'm gonna
dynamite the train.

984
00:38:43,788 --> 00:38:45,722
What makes you guys
so suspicious?

985
00:38:45,723 --> 00:38:48,776
I better get back to the house
and start packing.

986
00:38:48,777 --> 00:38:51,604
You think I ought to take
both my mink coats?

987
00:38:51,605 --> 00:38:54,303
Darling, no woman
should have two mink coats...

988
00:38:54,304 --> 00:38:56,787
until every woman in the world
has one mink coat.

989
00:38:56,788 --> 00:38:59,270
Cut the other one up
and make him a pair of shorts.

990
00:38:59,271 --> 00:39:01,072
I hear it's freezing there
all the time.

991
00:39:01,073 --> 00:39:02,273
Thirty below zero.

992
00:39:02,274 --> 00:39:03,640
Fascist lies!

993
00:39:03,641 --> 00:39:05,543
You better go home
and pack, too, darling.

994
00:39:05,544 --> 00:39:06,910
It will take me no time.

995
00:39:06,911 --> 00:39:09,680
Just my chessboard, my extra
shirt, and two hundred books.

996
00:39:09,681 --> 00:39:12,450
As long as Smiley here
is going back to East Berlin...

997
00:39:12,451 --> 00:39:13,683
I'll get the car for you.

998
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:15,185
Schlemmer, will you
run downstairs...

999
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:17,711
and tell Fritz he'll have
to take Scarlett home?

1000
00:39:18,422 --> 00:39:19,790
You're letting her go to Moscow?

1001
00:39:19,791 --> 00:39:21,024
In a pig's eye.

1002
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:23,426
Now, look.
His motorcycle's downstairs.

1003
00:39:23,427 --> 00:39:25,725
Remember that idea
you had about the balloon?

1004
00:39:27,932 --> 00:39:29,065
Just think, Liebchen...

1005
00:39:29,066 --> 00:39:31,869
tomorrow night, we'll be
strolling hand in hand...

1006
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:33,570
across Red Square.

1007
00:39:33,571 --> 00:39:34,605
I hope you won't be
ashamed of me...

1008
00:39:34,606 --> 00:39:36,207
in front of your friends.

1009
00:39:36,208 --> 00:39:37,407
Of course not.

1010
00:39:37,408 --> 00:39:40,094
I promise you, I'll only wear
my jewelry at home.

1011
00:39:40,095 --> 00:39:42,780
They have assigned us
a magnificent apartment...

1012
00:39:42,781 --> 00:39:44,682
just a short walk
from the bathroom.

1013
00:39:44,683 --> 00:39:45,782
I love you.

1014
00:39:45,783 --> 00:39:47,450
I'll make you very happy.

1015
00:39:47,451 --> 00:39:49,587
Every morning, we'll have
breakfast in bed.

1016
00:39:49,588 --> 00:39:50,920
Sounds wonderful.

1017
00:39:50,921 --> 00:39:52,623
Also lunch, also dinner.

1018
00:39:52,624 --> 00:39:53,890
In bed?

1019
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:55,393
There's no table and no chairs.

1020
00:39:55,394 --> 00:39:56,724
Who cares?

1021
00:40:00,097 --> 00:40:01,998
I'll pick you at 6:20 sharp...

1022
00:40:01,999 --> 00:40:04,535
because the 7:00 train to Moscow
leaves promptly at 8:15.

1023
00:40:04,536 --> 00:40:05,535
Wait a minute, kids.

1024
00:40:05,536 --> 00:40:07,538
Before you go, I'd like
to give you a little present.

1025
00:40:07,539 --> 00:40:08,638
Why?

1026
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:10,674
It's customary when
two people get married.

1027
00:40:10,675 --> 00:40:12,710
Otto's friends
didn't give us any presents.

1028
00:40:12,711 --> 00:40:14,010
Instead, they sent the money...

1029
00:40:14,011 --> 00:40:16,580
to the unemployed
cotton pickers in Mississippi.

1030
00:40:16,581 --> 00:40:18,382
How about a cocktail shaker?

1031
00:40:18,383 --> 00:40:20,151
No. I guess not.

1032
00:40:20,152 --> 00:40:21,311
I know.

1033
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:23,748
A cuckoo clock.

1034
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:27,958
Handmade by dwarfs
in the Black Forest.

1035
00:40:27,959 --> 00:40:30,026
So now they're
exploiting dwarfs.

1036
00:40:30,027 --> 00:40:32,830
I'm sorry I haven't got
any fancy wrapping paper.

1037
00:40:32,831 --> 00:40:34,889
We do not want
anything from you.

1038
00:40:36,333 --> 00:40:37,367
Otto, don't be rude.

1039
00:40:37,368 --> 00:40:39,804
I think it's very sweet
of Mr. MacNamara.

1040
00:40:39,805 --> 00:40:42,073
Now we'll have
a bed and a clock.

1041
00:40:42,074 --> 00:40:44,340
We will get
our own clock in Russia.

1042
00:40:44,341 --> 00:40:46,911
If your clocks don't run
any better than your trains...

1043
00:40:46,912 --> 00:40:48,678
you might as well take this one.

1044
00:40:48,679 --> 00:40:51,682
You laugh at us now,
but not for long...

1045
00:40:51,683 --> 00:40:54,685
because you're arrogant
and fat and bloated.

1046
00:40:54,686 --> 00:40:57,020
The worms will have a picnic.

1047
00:40:57,021 --> 00:40:59,355
See you on the barricades, pal.

1048
00:41:01,225 --> 00:41:03,694
When the day comes,
I'll put in a good word for you.

1049
00:41:03,695 --> 00:41:04,828
Scarlett!

1050
00:41:04,829 --> 00:41:06,564
It's my parents
I feel sorry for.

1051
00:41:06,565 --> 00:41:08,264
It's too late to save them.

1052
00:41:08,265 --> 00:41:10,734
Otto says
they'll have to be liquidated.

1053
00:41:10,735 --> 00:41:12,133
Bye!

1054
00:41:23,013 --> 00:41:24,993
Schlemmer!

1055
00:41:24,994 --> 00:41:26,974
Hurry up!

1056
00:41:38,362 --> 00:41:39,897
Wiedersehen, Liebchen.

1057
00:41:39,898 --> 00:41:41,489
Auf Wiedersehen.

1058
00:42:18,669 --> 00:42:20,638
Good boy, Schlemmer.

1059
00:42:20,639 --> 00:42:21,638
Yes, sir.

1060
00:42:21,639 --> 00:42:23,173
Anything else you wish me to do?

1061
00:42:23,174 --> 00:42:24,173
No, thanks.

1062
00:42:24,174 --> 00:42:25,308
We can just sit back now...

1063
00:42:25,309 --> 00:42:27,711
and let the East German
police finish the job.

1064
00:42:27,712 --> 00:42:28,711
Pardon me.

1065
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:31,448
I must be very stupid, but I
do not understand any of this.

1066
00:42:31,449 --> 00:42:32,582
There's nothing to it.

1067
00:42:32,583 --> 00:42:34,485
All it takes is a little
knowledge of physics...

1068
00:42:34,486 --> 00:42:36,419
and elementary psychology.

1069
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:38,822
Right now,
Comrade Otto Ludwig Piffl...

1070
00:42:38,823 --> 00:42:41,775
is tooling along
on his motorcycle...

1071
00:42:41,776 --> 00:42:44,728
toward East Berlin,
gay, chipper...

1072
00:42:44,729 --> 00:42:47,230
feeling like a million rubles.

1073
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:50,267
Little does he know that
meanwhile back at the exhaust...

1074
00:42:50,268 --> 00:42:53,070
the fumes
are filling the balloon.

1075
00:42:53,071 --> 00:42:55,939
It gets bigger and bigger...

1076
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:58,659
and all the time
in the sidecar...

1077
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:01,304
a little booby trap
is ticking away.

1078
00:43:01,305 --> 00:43:03,710
Now, if my calculations
are correct...

1079
00:43:03,711 --> 00:43:06,512
all these things
will begin to pay off...

1080
00:43:06,513 --> 00:43:09,313
once he passes through
the Brandenburg Gate.

1081
00:45:08,672 --> 00:45:12,109
You can forward my mail care of
American Express in Moscow.

1082
00:45:12,110 --> 00:45:14,678
And "Vogue" magazine
and "Screen Romances."

1083
00:45:14,679 --> 00:45:17,247
If you promise to send me
"Pravda" every day.

1084
00:45:17,248 --> 00:45:18,481
Just the funnies.

1085
00:45:18,482 --> 00:45:19,983
He should be here by now.

1086
00:45:19,984 --> 00:45:21,883
What time is it?

1087
00:45:21,884 --> 00:45:23,782
6:25. Relax.

1088
00:45:24,955 --> 00:45:26,557
Danke schn, danke schn.

1089
00:45:26,558 --> 00:45:27,557
don't mention it.

1090
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:29,860
Are you sure you want
to leave her that coat?

1091
00:45:29,861 --> 00:45:30,860
Oh, yes.

1092
00:45:30,861 --> 00:45:32,730
Otto thinks every woman
should have a mink.

1093
00:45:32,731 --> 00:45:34,330
I'm with Otto.

1094
00:45:34,331 --> 00:45:37,095
Maybe she'll let me
borrow it on my night out.

1095
00:45:38,602 --> 00:45:42,272
Do you realize that
Otto spelled backwards is Otto?

1096
00:45:42,273 --> 00:45:43,390
How about that?

1097
00:45:43,391 --> 00:45:44,507
You'll like him.

1098
00:45:44,508 --> 00:45:47,511
He looks just like Jack Kennedy,
only he's younger...

1099
00:45:47,512 --> 00:45:49,513
and he has more upstairs.

1100
00:45:49,514 --> 00:45:50,681
More brains?

1101
00:45:50,682 --> 00:45:51,848
More hair.

1102
00:45:51,849 --> 00:45:54,852
And of course, ideologically,
he's much sounder.

1103
00:45:54,853 --> 00:45:56,554
Maybe we voted
for the wrong man.

1104
00:45:56,555 --> 00:45:58,255
That couldn't happen in Russia.

1105
00:45:58,256 --> 00:45:59,289
They don't make mistakes?

1106
00:45:59,290 --> 00:46:00,654
They don't vote.

1107
00:46:02,493 --> 00:46:05,962
Have you ever made love
to a revolutionary?

1108
00:46:05,963 --> 00:46:09,665
No, but I once necked
with a Stevenson Democrat.

1109
00:46:09,666 --> 00:46:13,036
We'll, I've been engaged four
times, so I know about men...

1110
00:46:13,037 --> 00:46:15,472
and those subversives,
they're the wildest!

1111
00:46:15,473 --> 00:46:16,739
- Really?
- No contest.

1112
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:19,573
And I just thought we were
lagging behind in missiles.

1113
00:46:26,350 --> 00:46:28,518
Hiya, girls. Wie gehts?
Was ist cooking?

1114
00:46:28,519 --> 00:46:30,387
Bertha, you better
take Miss Hazeltine's luggage...

1115
00:46:30,388 --> 00:46:31,979
back upstairs.

1116
00:46:33,824 --> 00:46:35,592
Back upstairs? She's leaving.

1117
00:46:35,593 --> 00:46:36,842
I wouldn't count on it.

1118
00:46:36,843 --> 00:46:38,092
Bourbon and soda, anyone?

1119
00:46:38,796 --> 00:46:40,563
What's he talking about?

1120
00:46:40,564 --> 00:46:42,399
Otto's coming
to pick me up any minute.

1121
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:43,432
Oh, no, he's not.

1122
00:46:43,433 --> 00:46:46,036
Otto's been picked up himself
by the East German police.

1123
00:46:46,037 --> 00:46:47,570
Police? What for?

1124
00:46:47,571 --> 00:46:49,573
Who knows? Over there,
they toss people in jail...

1125
00:46:49,574 --> 00:46:51,559
like we throw away used Kleenex.

1126
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:53,603
- In jail?
- How do you know?

1127
00:46:53,604 --> 00:46:55,492
Bad news travels fast.
Say when.

1128
00:46:55,493 --> 00:46:57,380
Where is he? I must go to him.

1129
00:46:57,381 --> 00:46:58,565
That's the worst thing
you can do.

1130
00:46:58,566 --> 00:46:59,749
He's in trouble enough already.

1131
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:01,818
But he's my husband.
I want to help him.

1132
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:04,822
That's why we have to get the
marriage annulled right away.

1133
00:47:04,823 --> 00:47:06,189
- Annulled?
- Now wait a minute, Mac.

1134
00:47:06,190 --> 00:47:09,860
If on top of everything else,
they find out he's married...

1135
00:47:09,861 --> 00:47:12,396
to the parasite daughter
of an American capitalist...

1136
00:47:12,397 --> 00:47:14,163
they'll send him up
for twenty years...

1137
00:47:14,164 --> 00:47:17,450
slaving away in the salt mines,
schlepping those heavy bags...

1138
00:47:17,451 --> 00:47:20,737
barefoot through the snow
with nothing to keep him warm...

1139
00:47:20,738 --> 00:47:22,906
but the hot breath
of the Cossacks.

1140
00:47:22,907 --> 00:47:24,134
Otto!

1141
00:47:26,410 --> 00:47:27,934
Nice work, Mac.

1142
00:47:28,478 --> 00:47:30,446
Scarlett. Scarlett!

1143
00:47:31,782 --> 00:47:33,449
Try some ice.

1144
00:47:33,450 --> 00:47:35,884
Bertha, call Dr. Bauer,
will you?

1145
00:47:36,887 --> 00:47:39,055
I will call the doctor...

1146
00:47:39,056 --> 00:47:42,219
but I will not give back
the mink coat.

1147
00:47:49,233 --> 00:47:52,293
The temperature, she is normal.

1148
00:47:53,637 --> 00:47:55,161
Der pulse...

1149
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:57,440
What's the matter, doctor?

1150
00:47:57,441 --> 00:48:00,510
I have missed the first act
of "The Valkyrie."

1151
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:02,944
Der pulse is normal.

1152
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:11,548
Das ist definitely
nicht normal.

1153
00:48:12,422 --> 00:48:13,980
I'll fix that.

1154
00:48:18,095 --> 00:48:19,730
Cut it out, kids.

1155
00:48:19,731 --> 00:48:21,364
Scarlett is sick.

1156
00:48:21,365 --> 00:48:23,526
If she dies,
can I have my room back?

1157
00:48:27,004 --> 00:48:28,772
How would I know?
I'm not a lawyer.

1158
00:48:28,773 --> 00:48:30,000
That's your job.

1159
00:48:31,108 --> 00:48:33,175
What am I paying you for?

1160
00:48:33,176 --> 00:48:35,812
You must have
some contacts in East Berlin.

1161
00:48:35,813 --> 00:48:38,448
No! I don't want
the marriage just annulled.

1162
00:48:38,449 --> 00:48:40,083
I want it wiped off the books.

1163
00:48:40,084 --> 00:48:41,717
I don't care how you do it.

1164
00:48:41,718 --> 00:48:43,553
Bribe one of the clerks
over there.

1165
00:48:43,554 --> 00:48:44,720
Destroy the file.

1166
00:48:44,721 --> 00:48:46,889
If you guys could burn down
the Reichstag...

1167
00:48:46,890 --> 00:48:49,359
you can set a match to one
measly marriage certificate.

1168
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:51,054
It has to be done tonight!

1169
00:48:52,496 --> 00:48:53,696
Cheers.

1170
00:48:53,697 --> 00:48:55,565
Feeling pretty good,
aren't you, mein fhrer?

1171
00:48:55,566 --> 00:48:56,565
Not bad.

1172
00:48:56,566 --> 00:48:58,035
You framed that poor boy.

1173
00:48:58,036 --> 00:48:59,235
You bet I did.

1174
00:48:59,236 --> 00:49:00,637
I'm not gonna let
that Communist kook...

1175
00:49:00,638 --> 00:49:01,688
ruin somebody's life.

1176
00:49:01,689 --> 00:49:02,981
But she loves him.

1177
00:49:02,982 --> 00:49:04,273
Not her life, mine!

1178
00:49:04,274 --> 00:49:06,777
I'm all set for the London job.
You want me to blow it?

1179
00:49:06,778 --> 00:49:07,777
I couldn't care less.

1180
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:09,413
I'm fed up
with this whole deal...

1181
00:49:09,414 --> 00:49:10,746
hopping all around the map...

1182
00:49:10,747 --> 00:49:12,549
from Baghdad to Caracas
to Cape Town...

1183
00:49:12,550 --> 00:49:14,150
dragging our young behind us.

1184
00:49:14,151 --> 00:49:16,152
- Who needs it?
- What would you suggest?

1185
00:49:16,153 --> 00:49:18,689
Why can't you get yourself
a nice, permanent job...

1186
00:49:18,690 --> 00:49:20,289
with the home office
in Atlanta?

1187
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:24,227
You can't be serious.
That's Siberia with mint juleps.

1188
00:49:24,228 --> 00:49:26,029
Mac, I've had it.
I want to go home.

1189
00:49:26,030 --> 00:49:27,030
Give me one good reason.

1190
00:49:27,031 --> 00:49:28,130
All right.

1191
00:49:28,131 --> 00:49:29,833
Cindy has to have
her teeth straightened.

1192
00:49:29,834 --> 00:49:31,000
Tommy is ten years old.

1193
00:49:31,001 --> 00:49:33,269
He's never had
a peanut butter sandwich.

1194
00:49:33,270 --> 00:49:34,905
And for a change,
I'd like to see "Gunsmoke"...

1195
00:49:34,906 --> 00:49:37,240
not in German
or Portuguese or Swahili!

1196
00:49:37,241 --> 00:49:38,908
You want to go home
and pay taxes?

1197
00:49:38,909 --> 00:49:41,378
We've got it made-
big house, servants...

1198
00:49:41,379 --> 00:49:42,846
limousine,
fat expense account...

1199
00:49:42,847 --> 00:49:44,314
and you want to give
all that up...

1200
00:49:44,315 --> 00:49:45,614
for a peanut butter
sandwich?

1201
00:49:45,615 --> 00:49:47,567
It's a great life for you.
Everywhere we go...

1202
00:49:47,568 --> 00:49:49,519
you find yourself
some friendly secretary...

1203
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:51,455
who gives language lessons
on the side.

1204
00:49:51,456 --> 00:49:52,555
What does that mean?

1205
00:49:52,556 --> 00:49:54,674
I can always tell
when you've got a new teacher.

1206
00:49:54,675 --> 00:49:56,793
You start wearing your
elevator shoes to the office.

1207
00:49:56,794 --> 00:49:57,827
Are you implying...

1208
00:49:57,828 --> 00:49:58,961
I've known it for years.

1209
00:49:58,962 --> 00:50:01,630
You never said anything?
That's not fair.

1210
00:50:01,631 --> 00:50:04,568
I didn't want to be one of those
nagging American wives.

1211
00:50:04,569 --> 00:50:05,835
Maybe I was wrong.

1212
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:08,066
Maybe we should have had it out
a long time ago.

1213
00:50:12,976 --> 00:50:14,160
How is she, doctor?

1214
00:50:14,161 --> 00:50:15,344
Perfectly normal.

1215
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:17,748
She keeps asking
for somebody named Otto.

1216
00:50:17,749 --> 00:50:19,148
Otto? Never heard of him.

1217
00:50:19,149 --> 00:50:20,617
But she's going to be all right.

1218
00:50:20,618 --> 00:50:22,018
Hundert prozent.

1219
00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:24,955
You will be happy to know
that the young lady is...

1220
00:50:24,956 --> 00:50:27,524
How do you say it in English?
Schwanger?

1221
00:50:27,525 --> 00:50:28,525
Schwanger?

1222
00:50:28,526 --> 00:50:29,525
What's that?

1223
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:30,527
You're the one
who's studying German.

1224
00:50:30,528 --> 00:50:32,194
Schwanger. You know.

1225
00:50:32,195 --> 00:50:35,065
Such a dummkopf I am! Schwanger.

1226
00:50:35,066 --> 00:50:36,512
Schwanger, schwanger.

1227
00:50:36,513 --> 00:50:37,959
I know what it means.

1228
00:50:39,302 --> 00:50:40,302
What?

1229
00:50:40,303 --> 00:50:42,272
You told me
not to use words like that.

1230
00:50:42,273 --> 00:50:43,706
Come on!

1231
00:50:43,707 --> 00:50:45,275
You want me to tell you?

1232
00:50:45,276 --> 00:50:46,308
Please!

1233
00:50:46,309 --> 00:50:48,573
Scarlett's gonna have puppies.

1234
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:51,080
What?

1235
00:50:51,081 --> 00:50:52,081
She's pregnant?

1236
00:50:52,082 --> 00:50:54,684
That is the word. Pregnant!

1237
00:50:54,685 --> 00:50:55,684
Auf Wiedersehen.

1238
00:50:55,685 --> 00:50:57,515
Schwanger is pregnant

1239
00:50:57,516 --> 00:50:59,345
Pregnant is schwanger

1240
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:06,855
Mother of mercy.
Is this the end of Little Rico?

1241
00:51:07,497 --> 00:51:09,066
All right, children,
back to your room.

1242
00:51:09,067 --> 00:51:10,533
Get ready for bed.

1243
00:51:13,703 --> 00:51:15,839
I wonder what it's like
to work for Pepsi Cola.

1244
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:17,073
Please, Phyllis.

1245
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:18,942
So tomorrow,
Mr. and Mrs. Hazeltine...

1246
00:51:18,943 --> 00:51:20,609
will arrive at the airport...

1247
00:51:20,610 --> 00:51:22,344
and there will be
little Scarlett...

1248
00:51:22,345 --> 00:51:26,516
unchanged, unspoiled, unwed.
Just slightly schwanger.

1249
00:51:26,517 --> 00:51:27,516
Cheers.

1250
00:51:27,517 --> 00:51:29,419
Phyllis, I'm trying to think!

1251
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:30,786
Think fast, Mr. Moto...

1252
00:51:30,787 --> 00:51:32,689
because there will be
a few questions asked...

1253
00:51:32,690 --> 00:51:34,457
like, for instance,
who's the father?

1254
00:51:34,458 --> 00:51:36,443
I'll have the answers
when the time comes.

1255
00:51:36,444 --> 00:51:38,428
You better have Otto
when the time comes.

1256
00:51:38,429 --> 00:51:41,798
Otto? That would be disaster!

1257
00:51:41,799 --> 00:51:43,632
Let me see.

1258
00:51:43,633 --> 00:51:45,935
She was secretly married...

1259
00:51:45,936 --> 00:51:47,704
to somebody
in the American embassy.

1260
00:51:47,705 --> 00:51:49,623
They were honeymooning
in the Alps...

1261
00:51:49,624 --> 00:51:51,541
and he was killed
by an avalanche.

1262
00:51:51,542 --> 00:51:54,043
That's no good.

1263
00:51:54,044 --> 00:51:56,746
He was sent on a secret mission
behind the Iron Curtain.

1264
00:51:56,747 --> 00:51:58,080
Never heard from again!

1265
00:51:58,081 --> 00:52:00,083
As a matter of fact,
the whole thing was so secret...

1266
00:52:00,084 --> 00:52:01,802
we can't even mention his name.

1267
00:52:01,803 --> 00:52:03,519
Now you're really running amuck.

1268
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:05,322
You think Scarlett
is going to stand still for...

1269
00:52:05,323 --> 00:52:07,991
Better a dead hero
than a live Communist.

1270
00:52:07,992 --> 00:52:08,991
First thing in the morning...

1271
00:52:08,992 --> 00:52:10,560
I'll pick up
a distinguished service medal.

1272
00:52:10,561 --> 00:52:13,295
It was awarded to him
posthumously.

1273
00:52:13,296 --> 00:52:16,366
And while you're at it,
pin one on yourself.

1274
00:52:16,367 --> 00:52:19,703
First-class heel
with oak leaf cluster.

1275
00:52:19,704 --> 00:52:21,437
What do you want me to do?

1276
00:52:21,438 --> 00:52:23,521
I had enough trouble
getting the guy into jail.

1277
00:52:23,522 --> 00:52:25,604
It's gonna be ten times
as tough to get him out!

1278
00:52:38,822 --> 00:52:39,955
Schlemmer!

1279
00:52:39,956 --> 00:52:41,624
don't click your heels.

1280
00:52:41,625 --> 00:52:43,043
Schlemmer, I'm going to
need you tonight.

1281
00:52:43,044 --> 00:52:44,461
I'll pick you up
in front of your house...

1282
00:52:44,462 --> 00:52:45,661
in exactly ten minutes.

1283
00:52:45,662 --> 00:52:47,630
Call Ingeborg. Tell her
it's an emergency.

1284
00:52:47,631 --> 00:52:49,599
We'll pick her up
in exactly twelve minutes.

1285
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:50,896
Over and out!

1286
00:53:14,291 --> 00:53:15,292
Wo fahren Sie hin?

1287
00:53:15,293 --> 00:53:16,292
Ost Berlin.

1288
00:53:16,293 --> 00:53:17,560
- Papiere.
- American citizen.

1289
00:53:17,561 --> 00:53:18,827
What is purpose of your visit?

1290
00:53:18,828 --> 00:53:20,413
I'm going to see
Commissar Peripetchikoff...

1291
00:53:20,414 --> 00:53:21,998
chairman of
the Russian Trade Commission.

1292
00:53:21,999 --> 00:53:23,066
- What for?
- On business.

1293
00:53:23,067 --> 00:53:24,918
I represent Coca-Cola.

1294
00:53:24,919 --> 00:53:26,770
Coca-Cola? You have proof?

1295
00:53:26,771 --> 00:53:28,135
Will this do?

1296
00:53:30,207 --> 00:53:31,373
I confiscate proof.

1297
00:53:31,374 --> 00:53:32,876
Fair enough.
Just return the empties.

1298
00:53:32,877 --> 00:53:34,275
OK. Proceed.

1299
00:53:45,152 --> 00:53:48,022
If I may say so,
this whole idea is crazy.

1300
00:53:48,023 --> 00:53:50,224
It will not work.
I can feel it.

1301
00:53:50,225 --> 00:53:51,324
And I'm scared.

1302
00:53:51,325 --> 00:53:53,094
Pull yourself together.
That's an order.

1303
00:53:53,095 --> 00:53:54,127
Yes, sir.

1304
00:53:54,128 --> 00:53:57,130
I'm scared, also.
Not for myself.

1305
00:53:57,131 --> 00:53:59,767
I only worry something
will happen to my new dress.

1306
00:53:59,768 --> 00:54:02,102
I'll buy you
half a dozen dresses.

1307
00:54:02,103 --> 00:54:03,537
They're staying at
the Grand Hotel Potemkin.

1308
00:54:03,538 --> 00:54:04,537
You know where that is?

1309
00:54:04,538 --> 00:54:06,873
It used to be
the Great Hotel Gring...

1310
00:54:06,874 --> 00:54:09,240
and before that,
it was the Great Hotel Bismarck.

1311
00:55:20,714 --> 00:55:21,874
Hey!

1312
00:55:22,850 --> 00:55:24,517
Gaspadn MacNamara.

1313
00:55:24,518 --> 00:55:27,388
If it isn't my old friend
Hart, Schaffner, and Karl Marx.

1314
00:55:27,389 --> 00:55:29,290
I see you bring
blond lady with you.

1315
00:55:29,291 --> 00:55:30,657
Ring a ding ding.

1316
00:55:30,658 --> 00:55:32,710
Sit down!
Sit down, my friends.

1317
00:55:32,711 --> 00:55:34,762
- Join us.
- Right here, Frulein.

1318
00:55:34,763 --> 00:55:36,729
I said Karl Marx, not Groucho.

1319
00:55:36,730 --> 00:55:38,932
To what do we owe
this unexpected pleasure?

1320
00:55:38,933 --> 00:55:40,968
You're a trade commission.
I thought we might trade.

1321
00:55:40,969 --> 00:55:41,901
Coca-Cola?

1322
00:55:41,902 --> 00:55:43,069
No, but I hear you'd like...

1323
00:55:43,070 --> 00:55:44,738
Frulein Ingeborg
to go to work for you.

1324
00:55:44,739 --> 00:55:46,040
You want to trade
your secretary?

1325
00:55:46,041 --> 00:55:47,341
- Right.
- For Russian secretary?

1326
00:55:47,342 --> 00:55:48,741
- Wrong.
- I do not blame you.

1327
00:55:48,742 --> 00:55:51,176
Ours is built like
bowlegged samovar.

1328
00:55:56,450 --> 00:55:58,552
We find proposition
very interesting.

1329
00:55:58,553 --> 00:55:59,886
What can we offer you?

1330
00:55:59,887 --> 00:56:01,805
All I want from you
is a small favor.

1331
00:56:01,806 --> 00:56:03,723
Small favor,
big favor-anything.

1332
00:56:03,724 --> 00:56:05,225
There's a guy named
Otto Ludwig Piffl.

1333
00:56:05,226 --> 00:56:06,727
He's being held
by the East German police.

1334
00:56:06,728 --> 00:56:07,894
For what reason?

1335
00:56:07,895 --> 00:56:09,863
Son of a gun
stole my cuckoo clock.

1336
00:56:09,864 --> 00:56:11,832
- You want cuckoo clock back?
- Wrong.

1337
00:56:11,833 --> 00:56:13,067
- You want Piffl back?
- Right.

1338
00:56:13,068 --> 00:56:14,300
Impossible, my friend.

1339
00:56:14,301 --> 00:56:15,936
We cannot interfere
with internal affairs...

1340
00:56:15,937 --> 00:56:17,972
of Sovereign Republic
of East Germany.

1341
00:56:17,973 --> 00:56:20,006
No Piffl, no deal.
Let's go, Ingeborg.

1342
00:56:20,007 --> 00:56:23,010
Wait! What is the hurry?
You're not giving us a chance.

1343
00:56:23,011 --> 00:56:24,410
Is old Russian proverb...

1344
00:56:24,411 --> 00:56:26,847
you cannot milk cow
with hands in pockets.

1345
00:56:26,848 --> 00:56:30,618
Herr Robert! Vodka! Caviar!

1346
00:56:30,619 --> 00:56:32,566
Herr Kapellmeister!

1347
00:56:32,567 --> 00:56:34,514
More rock'n'roll!

1348
00:56:54,108 --> 00:56:55,268
Hey!

1349
00:57:07,321 --> 00:57:09,222
You like this caviar?

1350
00:57:09,223 --> 00:57:11,191
We give you a hundred pounds.

1351
00:57:11,192 --> 00:57:12,715
I want Piffl.

1352
00:57:44,825 --> 00:57:46,960
Would you take new automobile?

1353
00:57:46,961 --> 00:57:50,097
1961 Moskvich hardtop
convertible-two-toned.

1354
00:57:50,098 --> 00:57:53,667
You mean that Russian hot rod
parked outside?

1355
00:57:53,668 --> 00:57:57,237
Is wonderful car.
Is exact copy of 1927 Nash.

1356
00:57:57,238 --> 00:57:58,636
Not interested.

1357
00:58:41,615 --> 00:58:43,617
We will give you
Chinese cigarettes...

1358
00:58:43,618 --> 00:58:45,202
Armenian rugs...

1359
00:58:45,203 --> 00:58:46,677
Bulgarian yogurt?

1360
00:58:46,678 --> 00:58:48,152
Piffl or nothing.

1361
00:58:49,656 --> 00:58:54,194
We have warehouse full of
Spam left over from lend-lease.

1362
00:58:54,195 --> 00:58:56,163
It's 5:00, and we're
getting nowhere.

1363
00:58:56,164 --> 00:58:58,531
Ingeborg, put your shoes on.

1364
00:58:58,532 --> 00:59:01,592
One more minute, please.
Summit conference!

1365
00:59:06,507 --> 00:59:09,032
Before we make deal,
we want right of inspection.

1366
00:59:09,877 --> 00:59:11,295
I veto it.

1367
00:59:11,296 --> 00:59:12,712
I thought so.

1368
00:59:12,713 --> 00:59:16,115
What are we going to do?
He's got it, we want it.

1369
00:59:16,116 --> 00:59:19,153
Are we going to accept his
blackmailing capitalistic deal?

1370
00:59:19,154 --> 00:59:21,188
- Let us take a vote.
- I vote yes.

1371
00:59:21,189 --> 00:59:22,688
Two out of three.
Deal is on.

1372
00:59:22,689 --> 00:59:24,124
Comrades, before
we get in trouble...

1373
00:59:24,125 --> 00:59:25,525
I must warn you...

1374
00:59:25,526 --> 00:59:27,928
I'm not really from
Soft Drink Secretariat.

1375
00:59:27,929 --> 00:59:30,330
I'm undercover agent
assigned to watch you.

1376
00:59:30,331 --> 00:59:32,533
In that case, I vote no.
Deal is off.

1377
00:59:32,534 --> 00:59:33,833
But I vote yes.

1378
00:59:33,834 --> 00:59:36,268
Two out of three again!
Deal is on.

1379
01:00:04,031 --> 01:00:05,498
OK, kids, strip for action.

1380
01:00:10,904 --> 01:00:12,269
Nein.

1381
01:00:33,260 --> 01:00:34,921
Nein!

1382
01:00:37,231 --> 01:00:38,391
C.I.A.?

1383
01:00:49,643 --> 01:00:50,803
Nein.

1384
01:00:51,812 --> 01:00:52,972
Nein.

1385
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:21,229
C.I.A...

1386
01:01:46,466 --> 01:01:47,626
Borodenko.

1387
01:01:57,544 --> 01:01:59,513
Amerikanischer Spion?

1388
01:01:59,514 --> 01:02:00,810
Moment.

1389
01:02:01,915 --> 01:02:02,915
Did you hear that?

1390
01:02:02,916 --> 01:02:05,518
He is a confessed American spy.

1391
01:02:05,519 --> 01:02:07,254
In that case, I want
nothing to do with it...

1392
01:02:07,255 --> 01:02:09,223
because if they ever
find out in Moscow...

1393
01:02:09,224 --> 01:02:11,191
He's right.
No secretary is worth that risk.

1394
01:02:11,192 --> 01:02:13,260
Why should they
find out in Moscow?

1395
01:02:13,261 --> 01:02:14,511
I will not inform them.

1396
01:02:14,512 --> 01:02:15,761
But if they do find out...

1397
01:02:15,762 --> 01:02:17,998
then we just cross the border
into West Berlin.

1398
01:02:17,999 --> 01:02:20,234
That is easy for you to say.
You are a bachelor.

1399
01:02:20,235 --> 01:02:21,334
But if I defect...

1400
01:02:21,335 --> 01:02:23,169
you know what they
will do to my family?

1401
01:02:23,170 --> 01:02:25,439
They will line them up against
the wall and shoot them...

1402
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:27,073
my wife
and my mother-in-law...

1403
01:02:27,074 --> 01:02:28,974
and my sister-in-law
and my brother-in-law.

1404
01:02:30,210 --> 01:02:31,802
Comrades, let's do it.

1405
01:02:51,398 --> 01:02:54,101
You tried to bamboozle us.
You say he's cuckoo clock thief.

1406
01:02:54,102 --> 01:02:55,898
We know he's American spy.

1407
01:02:57,904 --> 01:03:00,374
You'd better get him out of here
before we all get into trouble.

1408
01:03:00,375 --> 01:03:01,534
Right.

1409
01:03:03,810 --> 01:03:06,113
It's a pleasure to do
business with you boys.

1410
01:03:06,114 --> 01:03:08,178
Wait! Where is blond lady?

1411
01:03:08,179 --> 01:03:10,242
I'll send her right over.

1412
01:03:41,148 --> 01:03:42,848
You poor baby.

1413
01:03:42,849 --> 01:03:45,511
- Did you hurt yourself?
- Let me help you.

1414
01:03:47,187 --> 01:03:49,314
He has bamboozled us again.

1415
01:04:12,579 --> 01:04:15,649
Those Russians, I hope they
were not too disappointed.

1416
01:04:15,650 --> 01:04:16,816
That's their problem.

1417
01:04:16,817 --> 01:04:18,918
Actually, they were very cute.

1418
01:04:18,919 --> 01:04:20,654
I can't decide which one
I liked best...

1419
01:04:20,655 --> 01:04:22,989
the big fat one or the bald one.

1420
01:04:22,990 --> 01:04:24,149
That's Schlemmer's problem.

1421
01:04:34,267 --> 01:04:35,598
Fritz, what's that behind us?

1422
01:04:37,270 --> 01:04:39,172
Looks like a 1927 Nash.

1423
01:04:39,173 --> 01:04:40,332
OK. Step on it.

1424
01:05:48,975 --> 01:05:50,135
Halt!

1425
01:05:54,047 --> 01:05:56,450
You remember us.
We came through earlier.

1426
01:05:56,451 --> 01:05:57,610
You wait.

1427
01:06:14,968 --> 01:06:16,128
Here is empties.

1428
01:06:42,062 --> 01:06:43,427
Let's go, Fritz.

1429
01:07:00,413 --> 01:07:04,713
Itsy-bitsy teeny-weeny
yellow polka dot bikini

1430
01:07:07,454 --> 01:07:08,887
Drop dead.

1431
01:07:26,339 --> 01:07:28,324
That's enough, Ingeborg.
Cut it out!

1432
01:07:28,325 --> 01:07:30,302
Why are you so
unfriendly this morning?

1433
01:07:30,303 --> 01:07:32,279
I thought everything
was wunderbar.

1434
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:33,512
Some wunderbar.

1435
01:07:33,513 --> 01:07:35,482
Can you imagine what's
going to happen at noon...

1436
01:07:35,483 --> 01:07:37,985
when the Hazeltines
step off that plane...

1437
01:07:37,986 --> 01:07:40,487
and get a load
of their new son-in-law?

1438
01:07:40,488 --> 01:07:41,620
You slob.

1439
01:07:41,621 --> 01:07:43,990
And when he opens
his big fat red mouth...

1440
01:07:43,991 --> 01:07:45,058
it's good-bye, Charlie.

1441
01:07:45,059 --> 01:07:46,643
Who is Charlie?

1442
01:07:46,644 --> 01:07:48,227
Charles H. Kaput.

1443
01:07:48,228 --> 01:07:49,829
What's keeping Scarlett?
I wish she'd get here.

1444
01:07:49,830 --> 01:07:51,298
I wish Schlemmer
would get here...

1445
01:07:51,299 --> 01:07:53,465
or anyway, send my dress back.

1446
01:07:53,466 --> 01:07:54,684
What do you want in this-
cream, sugar?

1447
01:07:54,685 --> 01:07:55,902
Just a couple of lumps
of Benzedrine.

1448
01:07:55,903 --> 01:07:57,699
It's going to be a rough day.

1449
01:08:13,486 --> 01:08:15,366
You'd better put something on.

1450
01:08:15,367 --> 01:08:17,247
Your goose pimples are showing.

1451
01:08:18,491 --> 01:08:21,619
Ooh, that's nothing.
You should see my sister.

1452
01:08:30,003 --> 01:08:31,470
Where is he?

1453
01:08:31,471 --> 01:08:34,207
Before that maniac wakes up,
I've got to talk to you.

1454
01:08:34,208 --> 01:08:36,109
There's only one way
out of this mess.

1455
01:08:36,110 --> 01:08:38,395
Otto. Otto, darling.

1456
01:08:38,396 --> 01:08:40,679
Otto, it's me-Scarlett.

1457
01:08:40,680 --> 01:08:43,950
Otto. Otto, darling, wake up.

1458
01:08:43,951 --> 01:08:45,718
- Otto.
- Scarlett?

1459
01:08:45,719 --> 01:08:48,888
Darling, I have something
very exciting to tell you.

1460
01:08:48,889 --> 01:08:50,219
How did I get here?

1461
01:08:56,830 --> 01:08:58,831
You!

1462
01:08:58,832 --> 01:09:00,700
I should take that
wedding present...

1463
01:09:00,701 --> 01:09:01,934
and break it over your head.

1464
01:09:01,935 --> 01:09:03,937
That's gratitude after all
the trouble I went through...

1465
01:09:03,938 --> 01:09:05,004
to get you out of jail.

1466
01:09:05,005 --> 01:09:06,338
- You got me into jail!
- So we're even.

1467
01:09:06,339 --> 01:09:09,876
You know, yesterday, when you
didn't show up, I fainted.

1468
01:09:09,877 --> 01:09:11,178
It's all his fault.

1469
01:09:11,179 --> 01:09:12,478
Well, not entirely.

1470
01:09:12,479 --> 01:09:14,214
don't you want to hear
what the doctor said?

1471
01:09:14,215 --> 01:09:15,949
Get him some coffee.
He's gonna need it.

1472
01:09:15,950 --> 01:09:17,083
From you,
I don't need anything.

1473
01:09:17,084 --> 01:09:18,285
I'm gonna have a baby.

1474
01:09:18,286 --> 01:09:19,485
If my wife wasn't here...

1475
01:09:19,486 --> 01:09:20,919
and if she wasn't gonna
have a baby...

1476
01:09:21,955 --> 01:09:24,391
- What?
- That's right.

1477
01:09:24,392 --> 01:09:26,382
Liebchen!

1478
01:09:28,895 --> 01:09:32,831
Just what the world needs-
another bouncing baby Bolshevik.

1479
01:09:34,167 --> 01:09:36,236
I was so afraid
you wouldn't want it.

1480
01:09:36,237 --> 01:09:37,837
You little fool.
I want dozens!

1481
01:09:37,838 --> 01:09:39,004
So do I.

1482
01:09:39,005 --> 01:09:40,640
So does the Party.
They encourage it.

1483
01:09:40,641 --> 01:09:42,642
We must out produce the West!

1484
01:09:42,643 --> 01:09:44,643
I hear they got a new plan now.

1485
01:09:44,644 --> 01:09:46,279
Instead of one woman taking
nine months to have a baby...

1486
01:09:46,280 --> 01:09:47,814
they're gonna put nine women
to work on it...

1487
01:09:47,815 --> 01:09:49,014
and do it in one month.

1488
01:09:49,015 --> 01:09:50,299
The minute
we arrive in Moscow...

1489
01:09:50,300 --> 01:09:51,576
we must get
on the waiting list...

1490
01:09:51,577 --> 01:09:52,852
for the People's
Maternity Ward...

1491
01:09:52,853 --> 01:09:54,453
and the People's Obstetrician.

1492
01:09:54,454 --> 01:09:57,257
No. I'd like to fly over
my own doctor from Atlanta...

1493
01:09:57,258 --> 01:09:59,159
and my own nurse
and my governess.

1494
01:09:59,160 --> 01:10:00,259
What for?

1495
01:10:00,260 --> 01:10:02,161
The State takes care
of everything!

1496
01:10:02,162 --> 01:10:04,464
At the age of six months,
the baby will be enrolled...

1497
01:10:04,465 --> 01:10:06,098
in the People's
Nursery School.

1498
01:10:06,099 --> 01:10:08,802
We will have visiting rights
every other Sunday.

1499
01:10:08,803 --> 01:10:10,436
Every other Sunday?

1500
01:10:10,437 --> 01:10:13,540
You can bring him some pabulum
with a file in it.

1501
01:10:13,541 --> 01:10:15,804
Imperialist stooge!

1502
01:10:16,543 --> 01:10:18,712
And of course,
we'll see him on May Day.

1503
01:10:18,713 --> 01:10:20,313
He'll be marching by
in the parade.

1504
01:10:20,314 --> 01:10:22,214
We can wave to him.

1505
01:10:22,215 --> 01:10:24,484
You can also wave to him
on Lenin's birthday...

1506
01:10:24,485 --> 01:10:26,485
and on Yuri Gagarin's birthday.

1507
01:10:26,486 --> 01:10:27,953
That kid will be parading
all the time.

1508
01:10:27,954 --> 01:10:30,557
Well, at least
it'll keep him off the streets.

1509
01:10:30,558 --> 01:10:33,292
The tickets.
Where are the tickets?

1510
01:10:33,293 --> 01:10:35,227
We must find out when the next
train leaves for Moscow.

1511
01:10:35,795 --> 01:10:38,732
Forget it, Piffl.
You're not going to Moscow.

1512
01:10:38,733 --> 01:10:40,934
You can't even
get back to East Berlin.

1513
01:10:40,935 --> 01:10:42,034
Why not?

1514
01:10:42,035 --> 01:10:44,137
Because you're an American spy.

1515
01:10:44,138 --> 01:10:45,272
Who said so?

1516
01:10:45,273 --> 01:10:46,405
You did.

1517
01:10:46,406 --> 01:10:48,604
don't you remember last night
at the police station?

1518
01:10:48,605 --> 01:10:50,802
You signed a confession-
an amerikanischer Spion.

1519
01:10:51,811 --> 01:10:52,971
Nein.

1520
01:10:53,546 --> 01:10:54,706
Ja!

1521
01:10:55,381 --> 01:10:56,381
Isn't that thrilling?

1522
01:10:56,382 --> 01:10:58,618
Darling, why didn't you tell me?

1523
01:10:58,619 --> 01:10:59,818
But I'm...

1524
01:10:59,819 --> 01:11:01,170
I'm not a spy! It's not true!

1525
01:11:01,171 --> 01:11:02,521
Makes you think, doesn't it...

1526
01:11:02,522 --> 01:11:03,906
about all those other
confessions they get?

1527
01:11:03,907 --> 01:11:05,291
Another hour,
and they'd have had you...

1528
01:11:05,292 --> 01:11:07,927
confessing to
germ warfare in Laos.

1529
01:11:07,928 --> 01:11:09,795
You did this to me.

1530
01:11:09,796 --> 01:11:10,897
You mean I gave you
the third degree?

1531
01:11:10,898 --> 01:11:11,965
Or was it your Communist chums?

1532
01:11:11,966 --> 01:11:12,965
You will come with me.

1533
01:11:12,966 --> 01:11:14,299
You will tell them
it was a trick.

1534
01:11:14,300 --> 01:11:17,403
You think they'd believe me,
an imperialist stooge?

1535
01:11:17,404 --> 01:11:18,570
I shall kill you!

1536
01:11:18,571 --> 01:11:20,235
Take it easy, kid,
or you'll wind up...

1537
01:11:20,236 --> 01:11:21,900
in the People's
Emergency Hospital.

1538
01:11:23,843 --> 01:11:27,210
Otto, darling, what are we
gonna call the baby?

1539
01:11:33,386 --> 01:11:37,223
My dress!
What did you do to my dress?

1540
01:11:37,224 --> 01:11:38,458
Schlemmer.

1541
01:11:38,459 --> 01:11:39,691
Yes, sir.

1542
01:11:39,692 --> 01:11:41,261
I'm sorry I didn't
shave this morning.

1543
01:11:41,262 --> 01:11:43,162
Look at my dress. It's ruined.

1544
01:11:43,163 --> 01:11:44,914
You have any trouble
getting out of East Berlin?

1545
01:11:44,915 --> 01:11:46,725
No, but I had a little trouble
in West Berlin.

1546
01:11:46,726 --> 01:11:48,535
I was picked up by
an American soldier in a Jeep.

1547
01:11:48,536 --> 01:11:50,169
He was very fresh...

1548
01:11:50,170 --> 01:11:52,738
wanted to take my picture
for something called "Playboy"?

1549
01:11:52,739 --> 01:11:54,908
Get out of those silly clothes.
We've got a lot of work to do.

1550
01:11:54,909 --> 01:11:56,743
Yes, sir.
If I can have my suit.

1551
01:11:56,744 --> 01:11:57,903
It's in your office.

1552
01:12:05,985 --> 01:12:08,520
And it's gonna be
such fun shopping.

1553
01:12:08,521 --> 01:12:11,057
We need a bassinet
and a crib and a layette...

1554
01:12:11,058 --> 01:12:13,593
and we have to run down
to Paris for a few days.

1555
01:12:13,594 --> 01:12:15,662
They have some marvy
maternity clothes...

1556
01:12:15,663 --> 01:12:16,929
at Christian Dior's.

1557
01:12:16,930 --> 01:12:18,531
Darling, you have to
forget all that.

1558
01:12:18,532 --> 01:12:20,583
We can't even afford
milk for the baby.

1559
01:12:20,584 --> 01:12:22,560
The doctors have
a whole new theory.

1560
01:12:22,561 --> 01:12:24,550
Milk's the worst thing
for babies.

1561
01:12:24,551 --> 01:12:26,538
Scarlett, don't you understand?

1562
01:12:26,539 --> 01:12:28,574
I am through, finished,
ausgespielt.

1563
01:12:28,575 --> 01:12:30,610
To the Communists,
I'm an American spy.

1564
01:12:30,611 --> 01:12:32,963
To the Americans,
I'm a Communist.

1565
01:12:32,964 --> 01:12:35,315
I have nothing-
no home, no job...

1566
01:12:35,316 --> 01:12:37,049
not even my motorcycle.

1567
01:12:37,050 --> 01:12:39,652
That's tough.
All you got is a rich wife.

1568
01:12:39,653 --> 01:12:42,254
He's right.
In January, when I'm eighteen...

1569
01:12:42,255 --> 01:12:44,924
Daddy's giving me ten thousand
shares of Coca-Cola stock.

1570
01:12:44,925 --> 01:12:47,125
I'm a worker, not a gigolo!

1571
01:12:47,126 --> 01:12:48,661
I will not take
any money from you.

1572
01:12:48,662 --> 01:12:49,962
You bet you won't!

1573
01:12:49,963 --> 01:12:51,598
Because when your father
finds out who you married...

1574
01:12:51,599 --> 01:12:53,400
he'll cut you off
without a red cent.

1575
01:12:53,401 --> 01:12:55,201
You should
pardon the expression.

1576
01:12:55,202 --> 01:12:56,301
I guess so.

1577
01:12:56,302 --> 01:12:58,371
Daddy has a fit every time
I order anything...

1578
01:12:58,372 --> 01:12:59,756
with Russian dressing.

1579
01:12:59,757 --> 01:13:01,139
Looks bad, doesn't it?

1580
01:13:01,140 --> 01:13:02,141
But it's a good thing
I like you kids.

1581
01:13:02,142 --> 01:13:03,141
I'm gonna help you...

1582
01:13:03,142 --> 01:13:04,777
if idiot-boy here
will cooperate.

1583
01:13:04,778 --> 01:13:06,329
You go to hell!

1584
01:13:06,330 --> 01:13:07,880
Long distance.

1585
01:13:07,881 --> 01:13:10,042
Mr. Hazeltine
calling from London.

1586
01:13:11,150 --> 01:13:14,017
London? The bloodhounds
are closing in.

1587
01:13:15,421 --> 01:13:17,471
Hello? Yes, Mr. Hazeltine.
This is MacNamara.

1588
01:13:17,472 --> 01:13:19,522
MacNamara, I'm gonna
have your head for this.

1589
01:13:20,193 --> 01:13:21,560
What do you mean, for what?

1590
01:13:21,561 --> 01:13:22,896
We get off
at the London airport...

1591
01:13:22,897 --> 01:13:23,929
to change planes...

1592
01:13:23,930 --> 01:13:25,297
and there's this telegram
waiting for me.

1593
01:13:25,298 --> 01:13:28,195
"Congratulations. You're
going to be a grandfather.

1594
01:13:28,196 --> 01:13:31,092
Signed, MacNamara."
Is this your idea of a joke?

1595
01:13:31,638 --> 01:13:33,672
No, it's not my idea of a joke.

1596
01:13:33,673 --> 01:13:35,375
Did somebody send
a telegram to your father?

1597
01:13:35,376 --> 01:13:37,944
Yes, Mrs. MacNamara.

1598
01:13:37,945 --> 01:13:39,104
Oh, she did.

1599
01:13:40,013 --> 01:13:41,113
Yes, it's true.

1600
01:13:41,114 --> 01:13:42,315
We didn't want you
to be too surprised...

1601
01:13:42,316 --> 01:13:43,475
when you got here.

1602
01:13:44,651 --> 01:13:46,986
MacNamara, I send you
a sweet, pure, innocent girl...

1603
01:13:46,987 --> 01:13:48,385
who isn't even
eighteen yet, and...

1604
01:13:49,656 --> 01:13:50,816
What?

1605
01:13:51,658 --> 01:13:53,960
It's all right, Melanie.
She's married.

1606
01:13:53,961 --> 01:13:55,227
Oh, thank heaven.

1607
01:13:55,228 --> 01:13:57,408
Wait a minute, MacNamara!
Not so fast!

1608
01:13:57,409 --> 01:13:59,588
Just exactly who
is she married to?

1609
01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:02,301
I wouldn't worry about it.

1610
01:14:02,302 --> 01:14:05,054
He's a wonderful boy-
handsome, cultured...

1611
01:14:05,055 --> 01:14:07,807
comes from one
of the best families in Europe.

1612
01:14:07,808 --> 01:14:09,408
You'll be crazy about him.

1613
01:14:09,409 --> 01:14:11,377
We'll bring him along
to the airport with us.

1614
01:14:11,378 --> 01:14:12,537
Happy landing.

1615
01:14:14,013 --> 01:14:15,180
Schlemmer!

1616
01:14:15,181 --> 01:14:16,281
What are you up to now?

1617
01:14:16,282 --> 01:14:18,751
All those lies.
You can't fool Daddy that easy.

1618
01:14:18,752 --> 01:14:20,153
I didn't say it was
gonna be easy...

1619
01:14:20,154 --> 01:14:21,254
but we sure can try.

1620
01:14:21,255 --> 01:14:22,354
Try what?

1621
01:14:22,355 --> 01:14:25,325
We're gonna turn this crumb bum
into a perfect son-in-law...

1622
01:14:25,326 --> 01:14:27,160
and we've got exactly
three hours and two minutes...

1623
01:14:27,161 --> 01:14:28,160
to do it in.

1624
01:14:28,161 --> 01:14:30,163
Oh, I get it. Isn't he clever?

1625
01:14:30,164 --> 01:14:31,163
Schlemmer!

1626
01:14:31,164 --> 01:14:33,266
I categorically refuse!

1627
01:14:33,267 --> 01:14:34,333
Sorry, sir.

1628
01:14:34,334 --> 01:14:36,135
I had difficulty
getting out of the girdle.

1629
01:14:36,136 --> 01:14:38,204
Schlemmer, I want all
those people out there...

1630
01:14:38,205 --> 01:14:40,273
to drop everything
and stand by for orders.

1631
01:14:40,274 --> 01:14:42,492
General alarm,
complete mobilization.

1632
01:14:42,493 --> 01:14:44,703
Like the good old days.
Yes, sir.

1633
01:14:44,704 --> 01:14:46,912
I will not be a party
to this scheme.

1634
01:14:46,913 --> 01:14:49,031
- If you don't love your wife.
- I worship her!

1635
01:14:49,032 --> 01:14:51,150
You know there's nothing
I wouldn't do for you...

1636
01:14:51,151 --> 01:14:53,886
but I will not
compromise my principles!

1637
01:14:53,887 --> 01:14:55,454
And I'd do anything for you...

1638
01:14:55,455 --> 01:14:57,556
even if we had
to starve together...

1639
01:14:57,557 --> 01:15:00,143
but we can't ask the baby
to starve, not at his age!

1640
01:15:00,144 --> 01:15:02,729
You're upsetting your wife.
Think of her condition.

1641
01:15:02,730 --> 01:15:05,297
I will not be turned
into a capitalist!

1642
01:15:05,298 --> 01:15:07,333
Once you are a son-in-law
in good standing...

1643
01:15:07,334 --> 01:15:08,533
I don't care what you do.

1644
01:15:08,534 --> 01:15:09,935
You can steal
the formula to Coca-Cola...

1645
01:15:09,936 --> 01:15:13,239
and square yourself with Moscow.
But at noon today...

1646
01:15:13,240 --> 01:15:16,208
you are going to look and act
like a gentleman!

1647
01:15:21,347 --> 01:15:23,372
Everybody at their posts
awaiting orders.

1648
01:15:24,317 --> 01:15:26,686
Here we go. Get a barber
and a manicurist...

1649
01:15:26,687 --> 01:15:27,753
up to the office.

1650
01:15:27,754 --> 01:15:29,755
Call my lawyer.
I want him here immediately.

1651
01:15:29,756 --> 01:15:31,824
I want to speak to the manager
of the Berlin Hilton.

1652
01:15:31,825 --> 01:15:33,893
Get ahold of what's-his-name-
that moth-eaten count...

1653
01:15:33,894 --> 01:15:35,928
that used to hang around
at the Cafe Wien.

1654
01:15:35,929 --> 01:15:37,562
Count von Droste-Schattenburg?

1655
01:15:37,563 --> 01:15:39,331
That's the one.
I want to see him right away.

1656
01:15:39,332 --> 01:15:41,100
And send Ingeborg in here
with pad and pencil.

1657
01:15:41,101 --> 01:15:43,295
- Yes, sir.
- Schnellmachen. 1, 2, 2!

1658
01:15:44,070 --> 01:15:45,537
- Ja!
- All right.

1659
01:15:45,538 --> 01:15:47,373
Next, we'd better
start cleaning him up.

1660
01:15:47,374 --> 01:15:49,207
- Over there.
- I've agreed to nothing!

1661
01:15:49,208 --> 01:15:51,911
Is it against the party line
to use indoor plumbing?

1662
01:15:51,912 --> 01:15:54,146
Come on, darling.
It won't hurt a bit.

1663
01:15:54,147 --> 01:15:56,945
Even if it hurts,
mit the hot water mit the soap.

1664
01:15:59,485 --> 01:16:01,320
- Yes, Mr. MacNamara.
- Ready?

1665
01:16:01,321 --> 01:16:02,480
Always ready.

1666
01:16:03,489 --> 01:16:06,224
Call Reinhardt and Reinhardt
custom tailors.

1667
01:16:06,225 --> 01:16:07,860
Have them send up everything
they've got in their shop...

1668
01:16:07,861 --> 01:16:10,580

Socks-French lisle,

1674
01:16:24,077 --> 01:16:26,479
Ties-not too wide,
not too narrow, not too fancy.

1675
01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:27,579
Also, pajamas, handkerchiefs...

1676
01:16:27,580 --> 01:16:29,815
cuff links, suspenders,
et cetera, et cetera.

1677
01:16:29,816 --> 01:16:32,215
Next, call Hochstaetter's.
Have them deliver shoes...

1678
01:16:32,216 --> 01:16:34,614
British or Italian models,
brown and black, size 9B.

1679
01:16:36,322 --> 01:16:37,422
Yes, Fritz.

1680
01:16:37,423 --> 01:16:38,690
No, Fritz. I need you.

1681
01:16:38,691 --> 01:16:41,394
Sleepy or not sleepy,
everybody works today.

1682
01:16:41,395 --> 01:16:43,396
Next, call
any first-class hatter.

1683
01:16:43,397 --> 01:16:44,663
I want an assortment of hats...

1684
01:16:44,664 --> 01:16:47,867
no porkpies, none of that
Tyrolean jazz, size 72/8.

1685
01:16:47,868 --> 01:16:51,269
Correction-
after we cut his hair, 71/8.

1686
01:16:51,270 --> 01:16:53,322
Next, call that department store
on Tauenzienstrasse.

1687
01:16:53,323 --> 01:16:55,374
Have them bring up a matched set
of men's luggage...

1688
01:16:55,375 --> 01:16:56,374
cowhide or pigskin.

1689
01:16:56,375 --> 01:16:58,009
Next, call the Ritz jewelers.

1690
01:16:58,010 --> 01:16:59,795
I want to see a selection
of gold wedding rings.

1691

Also engagement rings-
diamond solitaire...

no less than two carats,
no more than four.

1693
01:17:03,417 --> 01:17:05,168
Make sure he scrubs
behind his ears.

1694
01:17:05,169 --> 01:17:06,918
Next, call
Kottler's Restaurant.

1695
01:17:06,919 --> 01:17:08,454
Have them send up one
deluxe seven-course dinner...

1696
01:17:08,455 --> 01:17:10,188
and one complete table setting.

1697
01:17:10,189 --> 01:17:12,458
Call a florist. Have them make
a bouquet of chrysanthemums.

1698
01:17:12,459 --> 01:17:14,794
Also, two boutonnieres-
white carnations.

1699
01:17:14,795 --> 01:17:16,394
Any questions?

1700
01:17:16,395 --> 01:17:19,198
Yes. Can I go home
and get some clothes?

1701
01:17:19,199 --> 01:17:20,799
At a time like this?

1702
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:22,568
Dressed or not dressed,
everybody works today.

1703
01:17:22,569 --> 01:17:23,753
Now get with it.

1704
01:17:23,754 --> 01:17:24,936
Haarschnitt.

1705
01:17:24,937 --> 01:17:26,271
- Manicure?
- Not me-him.

1706
01:17:26,272 --> 01:17:27,507
Take him into
the conference room...

1707
01:17:27,508 --> 01:17:28,508
and chop that mop off.

1708
01:17:28,509 --> 01:17:29,508
Jawohl.

1709
01:17:29,509 --> 01:17:30,510
And give him a shave
and a manicure.

1710
01:17:30,511 --> 01:17:31,510
Jawohl.

1711
01:17:31,511 --> 01:17:33,513
- No!
- What do you mean, no?

1712
01:17:33,514 --> 01:17:34,746
No manicure.

1713
01:17:34,747 --> 01:17:37,450
It's a symbol of bourgeois
decadence and insecurity.

1714
01:17:37,451 --> 01:17:39,152
Oh, sure. In Russia,
everybody is so secure...

1715
01:17:39,153 --> 01:17:40,452
they chew their nails off.

1716
01:17:40,453 --> 01:17:42,421
Come on, darling.
Nobody will ever know.

1717
01:17:42,422 --> 01:17:44,422
- You can wear gloves.
- Gloves?

1718
01:17:44,423 --> 01:17:46,789
Why don't you ask me
to wear striped pants?

1719
01:17:50,396 --> 01:17:52,331
Ingeborg, when you
talk to that tailor...

1720
01:17:52,332 --> 01:17:53,765
I also want some
striped pants...

1721
01:17:53,766 --> 01:17:55,358
a morning coat,
and a white waistcoat.

1722
01:17:57,270 --> 01:17:59,538
I have located
Count von Droste-Schattenburg.

1723
01:17:59,539 --> 01:18:02,408
He's working the men's room
at the Kempinski Hotel.

1724
01:18:02,409 --> 01:18:03,408
How soon can he get here?

1725
01:18:03,409 --> 01:18:04,743
Well, this is
his busy time of the day.

1726
01:18:04,744 --> 01:18:06,078
He wants to know
if you can come there.

1727
01:18:06,079 --> 01:18:07,078
Absolutely not.

1728
01:18:07,079 --> 01:18:08,614
I'll tell him.
And your lawyer is here.

1729
01:18:08,615 --> 01:18:09,945
Come in!

1730
01:18:10,950 --> 01:18:13,169
Herr MacNamara,
isn't this a glorious day?

1731
01:18:13,170 --> 01:18:15,388
Cut the schmooze.
Now, listen, Zeidlitz.

1732
01:18:15,389 --> 01:18:16,488
Here's what I want you to do.

1733
01:18:16,489 --> 01:18:18,941
It has already been done.
Complete success.

1734
01:18:18,942 --> 01:18:21,394
The young lady can
consider herself unmarried.

1735
01:18:21,395 --> 01:18:23,528
- Unmarried?
- It wasn't easy.

1736
01:18:23,529 --> 01:18:25,330
I managed to liberate
that marriage license...

1737
01:18:25,331 --> 01:18:27,867
from the files in East Berlin
just like you ordered.

1738
01:18:27,868 --> 01:18:29,702
It's that damned
German efficiency.

1739
01:18:29,703 --> 01:18:31,069
That's all I need now...

1740
01:18:31,070 --> 01:18:32,638
an illegitimate baby
on my hands.

1741
01:18:32,639 --> 01:18:33,638
I beg your pardon.

1742
01:18:33,639 --> 01:18:34,639
He's bringing the shoes.

1743
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:36,642
Shoes? Unpack them.
Let's see what you've got.

1744
01:18:36,643 --> 01:18:38,710
I want you to go back
to East Berlin...

1745
01:18:38,711 --> 01:18:41,347
and put that marriage license
right back in the file.

1746
01:18:41,348 --> 01:18:42,347
If you say so.

1747
01:18:42,348 --> 01:18:43,883
First, I want you
to draw up some adoption papers.

1748
01:18:43,884 --> 01:18:46,352
- For the baby?
- No, for Otto Ludwig Piffl.

1749
01:18:46,353 --> 01:18:47,352
We're going to
have him adopted...

1750
01:18:47,353 --> 01:18:49,589
by a real honest-to-goodness,
blue-blooded aristocrat.

1751
01:18:49,590 --> 01:18:51,089
- A baron?
- Better than that.

1752
01:18:51,090 --> 01:18:52,792
The guy who's working in
the men's room at the Kempinski.

1753
01:18:52,793 --> 01:18:55,261
Leave the name blank.
I haven't made the deal yet.

1754
01:18:55,262 --> 01:18:56,494
Now get to work. In there.

1755
01:18:56,495 --> 01:19:00,032
Next, shoes.
No, no. Nothing with tassels.

1756
01:19:00,033 --> 01:19:01,132
Those are all right.

1757
01:19:01,133 --> 01:19:03,069
Alligator?
That's for bandleaders.

1758
01:19:03,070 --> 01:19:04,593
Those are OK. OK.

1759
01:19:06,272 --> 01:19:08,173
Totally unacceptable.
Full of holes.

1760
01:19:08,174 --> 01:19:10,942
Guten Morgen. Reinhardt
from Reinhardt and Reinhardt.

1761
01:19:10,943 --> 01:19:13,446
Be right with you. I'll take
those and those but not those.

1762
01:19:13,447 --> 01:19:14,613
What have we got here?

1763
01:19:14,614 --> 01:19:16,849
Latest English styles.
All fabrics imported.

1764
01:19:16,850 --> 01:19:18,417
They look more like
they were deported.

1765
01:19:18,418 --> 01:19:20,018
Too loud. Too quiet.
All right...

1766
01:19:20,019 --> 01:19:21,887
but take the padding
out of the shoulders.

1767
01:19:21,888 --> 01:19:24,589
That's not bad.
Belt on the back?

1768
01:19:24,590 --> 01:19:25,725
I thought that went out
with high-buttoned shoes.

1769
01:19:25,726 --> 01:19:27,726
High-buttoned shoes?
I have some right here.

1770
01:19:27,727 --> 01:19:29,729
Never mind. Take that stuff
into the conference room.

1771
01:19:29,730 --> 01:19:30,730
I want these ready
in twenty-four hours.

1772
01:19:30,731 --> 01:19:31,796
Twenty-four hours?

1773
01:19:31,797 --> 01:19:32,798
Where's the morning coat
and striped pants?

1774
01:19:32,799 --> 01:19:33,966
My assistant is bringing them.

1775
01:19:33,967 --> 01:19:35,651
Those I want fitted right away.

1776
01:19:35,652 --> 01:19:37,336
- Schmuck.
- What did you say?

1777
01:19:37,337 --> 01:19:39,271
Schmuck. Jewelry.

1778
01:19:39,272 --> 01:19:41,331
Oh. Come with me. You, too.

1779
01:19:45,678 --> 01:19:46,845
Sitzen machen.

1780
01:19:46,846 --> 01:19:49,115
A strong, healthy girl like you
should not be cutting nails.

1781
01:19:49,116 --> 01:19:51,583
You should be cutting
wheat in the Ukraine.

1782
01:19:51,584 --> 01:19:54,553
Leave it a little longer
on the sides, like Sal Mineo.

1783
01:19:54,554 --> 01:19:55,588
Pick a couple of wedding rings.

1784
01:19:55,589 --> 01:19:56,923
Left foot, please.

1785
01:19:56,924 --> 01:19:58,257
Do you like these?

1786
01:19:58,258 --> 01:19:59,391
Gold? Never.

1787
01:19:59,392 --> 01:20:01,527
I prefer the honest steel
of the guns of Stalingrad.

1788
01:20:01,528 --> 01:20:03,446
You guys are always
yakking about disarmament.

1789
01:20:03,447 --> 01:20:05,364
We might as well start
right here and now.

1790
01:20:05,365 --> 01:20:06,398
Stand up, please.

1791
01:20:06,399 --> 01:20:07,400
He's also giving you
an engagement ring.

1792
01:20:07,401 --> 01:20:08,785
- He is?
- I am?

1793
01:20:08,786 --> 01:20:10,168
They're too big.

1794
01:20:10,169 --> 01:20:12,305
I assume the gentleman
will wear socks.

1795
01:20:12,306 --> 01:20:13,371
Not if I can help it.

1796
01:20:13,372 --> 01:20:15,474
Waist thirty-one.
Sit down, please.

1797
01:20:15,475 --> 01:20:16,474
I want this one.

1798
01:20:16,475 --> 01:20:17,843
- How much?
- Eight thousand marks.

1799
01:20:17,844 --> 01:20:18,843
Thank you, darling.

1800
01:20:18,844 --> 01:20:20,912
Wait! Who's paying
for this foolishness?

1801
01:20:20,913 --> 01:20:22,982
Relax. You've got assets-
all that Coca-Cola stock.

1802
01:20:22,983 --> 01:20:25,050
You expect me to sit
on my assets and clip coupons?

1803
01:20:25,051 --> 01:20:28,154
The baby will clip the coupons.
We'll put the money in his name.

1804
01:20:28,155 --> 01:20:29,387
Sit down, please.

1805
01:20:29,388 --> 01:20:31,407
I will not have my son
grow up to be a capitalist!

1806
01:20:31,408 --> 01:20:33,426
When he's eighteen,
he can decide for himself...

1807
01:20:33,427 --> 01:20:34,760
whether he wants
to be a capitalist...

1808
01:20:34,761 --> 01:20:36,284
or a rich Communist.

1809
01:20:40,066 --> 01:20:42,668
Yes? Who? The manager
of the Berlin Hilton?

1810
01:20:42,669 --> 01:20:43,836
Put him on.

1811
01:20:43,837 --> 01:20:45,003
Over there.

1812
01:20:45,004 --> 01:20:47,239
Hello? I want to reserve
the bridal suite.

1813
01:20:47,240 --> 01:20:49,107
Yes, checking in today.

1814
01:20:49,108 --> 01:20:51,376
I didn't ask you
how much it cost.

1815
01:20:51,377 --> 01:20:53,479
This is for the son-in-law
of an American millionaire.

1816
01:20:53,480 --> 01:20:54,779
Double bed, naturally.
Silk sheets.

1817
01:20:54,780 --> 01:20:57,149
Tell them we don't need
a table and chairs.

1818
01:20:57,150 --> 01:20:59,518
We're going to have
all our meals in bed.

1819
01:20:59,519 --> 01:21:00,719
Never mind the silk sheets.

1820
01:21:00,720 --> 01:21:03,211
Just make it a tablecloth
and two napkins.

1821
01:21:04,190 --> 01:21:06,992
Silk sheets, diamond rings,
bridal suites.

1822
01:21:06,993 --> 01:21:09,595
What is this,
"La Dolce Vita"?

1823
01:21:09,596 --> 01:21:11,180
Hey! What are you doing?

1824
01:21:11,181 --> 01:21:12,764
Stop it! Are you crazy?

1825
01:21:12,765 --> 01:21:14,847
The haberdasher's
in your office.

1826
01:21:14,848 --> 01:21:16,929
Keep an eye
on the Kremlin Kid.

1827
01:21:17,870 --> 01:21:20,806
There's a newspaperman
to see you from the "Tageblatt."

1828
01:21:20,807 --> 01:21:22,535
Not today.

1829
01:21:23,743 --> 01:21:25,677
Sitzen machen.

1830
01:21:25,678 --> 01:21:28,714
No, no. White shirts only.
Two dozen. French cuff.

1831
01:21:28,715 --> 01:21:29,981
Handkerchiefs, OK.
Socks, fine.

1832
01:21:29,982 --> 01:21:31,951
If he objects, we'll just
have to paint his feet black.

1833
01:21:31,952 --> 01:21:33,970
- Where are the pajamas?
- Right here.

1834
01:21:33,971 --> 01:21:35,980
- OK. OK. What's this?
- They're beautiful.

1835
01:21:35,981 --> 01:21:37,989
- They are terrible.
- They are terrible.

1836
01:21:37,990 --> 01:21:39,992
Let's see the ties.
Jawohl, nix, jawohl, jawohl...

1837
01:21:39,993 --> 01:21:41,653
definitely nix.
This is the best.

1838
01:21:41,727 --> 01:21:43,963
- It is mine.
- Take it off. I'm buying it.

1839
01:21:43,964 --> 01:21:45,096
Good morning, Phyllis.

1840
01:21:45,097 --> 01:21:47,683
Looks like the Berlin branch
of Macy's Basement.

1841
01:21:47,684 --> 01:21:50,269
- It's a rat race around here.
- And I know the rat.

1842
01:21:50,270 --> 01:21:51,787
This robe,
it is jawohl or nix?

1843
01:21:51,788 --> 01:21:53,304
Sit down.
I'll be right with you.

1844
01:21:53,305 --> 01:21:56,001
don't bother. I just want
something from the safe.

1845
01:21:57,510 --> 01:22:00,411
- What's the combination?
-22-5-17.

1846
01:22:01,313 --> 01:22:02,480
Throw that robe in...

1847
01:22:02,481 --> 01:22:04,850
and start taking this stuff
into the conference room.

1848
01:22:04,851 --> 01:22:07,219
That guy in there, don't
tell him those are French cuffs.

1849
01:22:07,220 --> 01:22:09,449
Not with the Algerian
situation the way it is.

1850
01:22:10,122 --> 01:22:11,453
What are you looking for?

1851
01:22:11,991 --> 01:22:14,192
- Here they are. The passports.
- Passports?

1852
01:22:14,193 --> 01:22:16,462
I'm flying back to the States,
and I'm taking the kids with me.

1853
01:22:16,463 --> 01:22:18,463
- You're what?
- You heard me.

1854
01:22:18,464 --> 01:22:20,900
What are you sore about now?
I got Otto back, didn't I?

1855
01:22:20,901 --> 01:22:21,900
I'm remodeling him.

1856
01:22:21,901 --> 01:22:23,702
Somebody should do
a little job on you.

1857
01:22:23,703 --> 01:22:24,769
Good-bye, Mac.

1858
01:22:24,770 --> 01:22:26,705
Phyllis, you can't
walk out on me like this.

1859
01:22:26,706 --> 01:22:27,806
I'm not walking out.

1860
01:22:27,807 --> 01:22:29,275
I'm just going back
where I belong...

1861
01:22:29,276 --> 01:22:30,743
and any time you'd
care to join us...

1862
01:22:30,744 --> 01:22:31,876
we'll be waiting for you.

1863
01:22:31,877 --> 01:22:33,546
The adoption papers,
they are ready.

1864
01:22:33,547 --> 01:22:34,706
Heraus.

1865
01:22:35,314 --> 01:22:37,616
What's come over you, Phyllis?
After sixteen years...

1866
01:22:37,617 --> 01:22:38,950
Maybe after sixteen years...

1867
01:22:38,951 --> 01:22:40,719
every marriage
gets a little stale...

1868
01:22:40,720 --> 01:22:42,053
like a leftover glass of beer.

1869
01:22:42,054 --> 01:22:43,689
Look, Phyllis, can't we
discuss this problem...

1870
01:22:43,690 --> 01:22:45,290
without bringing up
a rival beverage?

1871
01:22:45,291 --> 01:22:47,476
I hope these vaccination
certificates are still good.

1872
01:22:47,477 --> 01:22:49,662
Look, Phyllis, you knew
the kind of a guy I was...

1873
01:22:49,663 --> 01:22:50,663
when you married me.

1874
01:22:50,664 --> 01:22:51,663
Apparently not.

1875
01:22:51,664 --> 01:22:53,164
I'm not one
of those suburban jokers...

1876
01:22:53,165 --> 01:22:55,468
9:00 to 5:00 in the office,
home on the commuter train...

1877
01:22:55,469 --> 01:22:57,170
cut the grass every weekend.

1878
01:22:57,171 --> 01:22:58,870
Turns out I married Marco Polo.

1879
01:22:58,871 --> 01:23:01,440
It wasn't all that bad,
those sixteen years.

1880
01:23:01,441 --> 01:23:02,674
We've had some fun.

1881
01:23:02,675 --> 01:23:05,076
Remember Teheran
when Cindy was born...

1882
01:23:05,077 --> 01:23:07,746
driving 12 miles to the hospital
in a Coca-Cola truck?

1883
01:23:07,747 --> 01:23:10,132
Some fun. And remember
when I had Tommy?

1884
01:23:10,133 --> 01:23:12,517
Do I ever.
Right in the Zurich airport.

1885
01:23:12,518 --> 01:23:14,986
We had a hell of a time
getting him out of customs.

1886
01:23:14,987 --> 01:23:17,289
And how about our honeymoon,
that wonderful week in Waikiki?

1887
01:23:17,290 --> 01:23:20,893
Yeah, me upstairs putting
perfume behind my ears.

1888
01:23:20,894 --> 01:23:23,661
You downstairs
at a soft drink convention.

1889
01:23:23,662 --> 01:23:26,014
Four hundred men running around
in grass skirts.

1890
01:23:26,015 --> 01:23:28,367
I should have said aloha
right then and there.

1891
01:23:28,368 --> 01:23:30,236
Now, be a good girl
and give me those.

1892
01:23:30,237 --> 01:23:31,969
Let's talk this over.

1893
01:23:31,970 --> 01:23:33,702
All right. I'm willing.

1894
01:23:36,509 --> 01:23:37,509
But not right now.

1895
01:23:37,510 --> 01:23:38,878
The Hazeltines
will be here at noon.

1896
01:23:38,879 --> 01:23:40,211
I've got a deadline.

1897
01:23:40,212 --> 01:23:41,847
You've got a deadline with me.

1898
01:23:41,848 --> 01:23:43,481
Phyllis, baby,
I love you.

1899
01:23:43,482 --> 01:23:45,767
Take my word for it.
Everything is going to be fine.

1900
01:23:45,768 --> 01:23:48,053
We'll be living in London.
Tommy can go to Oxford.

1901
01:23:48,054 --> 01:23:49,789
Cindy can watch
the changing of the guard.

1902
01:23:49,790 --> 01:23:51,524
We can afford one
of those snooty butlers...

1903
01:23:51,525 --> 01:23:52,892
kippers and marmalade
for breakfast...

1904
01:23:52,893 --> 01:23:54,553
riding to hounds.

1905
01:23:56,061 --> 01:23:58,180
I will not be caught dead
in striped pants.

1906
01:23:58,181 --> 01:24:00,299
They're for bankers
and war profiteers.

1907
01:24:00,300 --> 01:24:01,633
Actually, they were ordered...

1908
01:24:01,634 --> 01:24:04,570
by the ambassador from the
People's Republic of Yugoslavia.

1909
01:24:04,571 --> 01:24:06,472
We will deal with Tito
when the time comes.

1910
01:24:06,473 --> 01:24:07,907
Meanwhile, take them off
and fix them.

1911
01:24:07,908 --> 01:24:08,925
They're much too big.

1912
01:24:08,926 --> 01:24:09,941
In front of the lady?

1913
01:24:09,942 --> 01:24:12,010
Oh, yeah, I forgot.
He doesn't wear shorts.

1914
01:24:12,011 --> 01:24:14,079
No wonder they're
winning the Cold War.

1915
01:24:14,080 --> 01:24:15,842
All right. In the other room.

1916
01:24:19,552 --> 01:24:20,712
don't go away, Phyllis.

1917
01:24:23,889 --> 01:24:26,225
Ingeborg, get him some shorts.

1918
01:24:26,226 --> 01:24:27,522
Sitzen machen.

1919
01:24:32,131 --> 01:24:33,766
Good morning, Mrs. MacNamara.

1920
01:24:33,767 --> 01:24:34,799
Guten Morgen.

1921
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:37,928
Shorts. Let me see.
Where are the shorts?

1922
01:24:39,071 --> 01:24:41,139
You could use some yourself.

1923
01:24:41,140 --> 01:24:43,207
I don't want you to think...

1924
01:24:43,208 --> 01:24:45,444
I come to the office
like this every day.

1925
01:24:45,445 --> 01:24:46,945
That's a load off my mind.

1926
01:24:46,946 --> 01:24:50,182
Last night Mr. MacNamara
made me take my dress off.

1927
01:24:50,183 --> 01:24:51,182
Playful, isn't he?

1928
01:24:51,183 --> 01:24:54,119
He had a perfect right to.
After all, he paid for it.

1929
01:24:54,120 --> 01:24:55,754
Well, that makes
all the difference.

1930
01:24:55,755 --> 01:24:57,388
No, no, no.
You don't understand.

1931
01:24:57,389 --> 01:25:00,825
It's part of my job.
What you call fringe benefits.

1932
01:25:01,827 --> 01:25:04,663
How do you like that?
The son of a...

1933
01:25:04,664 --> 01:25:07,499
is starting
his own Marshall Plan.

1934
01:25:07,500 --> 01:25:09,833
Oh, here. I go now.

1935
01:25:09,834 --> 01:25:12,166
We both go now.

1936
01:25:13,238 --> 01:25:15,040
Will you please give
my husband a message?

1937
01:25:15,041 --> 01:25:16,542
Tell him I said aloha.

1938
01:25:16,543 --> 01:25:17,542
Aloha?

1939
01:25:17,543 --> 01:25:19,374
That's Hawaiian for "get lost."

1940
01:25:22,748 --> 01:25:23,782
What's holding up those shorts?

1941
01:25:23,783 --> 01:25:24,782
Right here.

1942
01:25:24,783 --> 01:25:27,486
And your wife said
to tell you aloha.

1943
01:25:27,487 --> 01:25:30,189
That's Hawaiian for "get lost."

1944
01:25:30,190 --> 01:25:31,554
Phyllis!

1945
01:25:39,431 --> 01:25:40,933
The dinner,
where do you want it?

1946
01:25:40,934 --> 01:25:42,264
In the conference room.

1947
01:25:43,469 --> 01:25:44,469
Phyllis!

1948
01:25:44,470 --> 01:25:46,071
Mr. MacNamara,
my name is Untermeier.

1949
01:25:46,072 --> 01:25:47,723
I'm a reporter
from the "Tageblatt."

1950
01:25:47,724 --> 01:25:49,375
don't bother me.
Some other time.

1951
01:25:49,376 --> 01:25:50,675
But this is important.

1952
01:25:50,676 --> 01:25:52,544
We have information that
Miss Hazeltine of Coca-Cola...

1953
01:25:52,545 --> 01:25:54,096
married somebody
in East Berlin...

1954
01:25:54,097 --> 01:25:55,648
a member
of the Communist Party.

1955
01:25:55,649 --> 01:25:57,515
Sitzen machen.

1956
01:25:57,516 --> 01:25:59,551
I will not wear these.
They look ridiculous.

1957
01:25:59,552 --> 01:26:00,970
They serve no useful purpose.

1958
01:26:00,971 --> 01:26:02,387
Darling, it's just a convention.

1959
01:26:02,388 --> 01:26:04,556
Back home, we even put
panties on lamb chops.

1960
01:26:04,557 --> 01:26:06,791
They are drip and dry.
50% nylon.

1961
01:26:06,792 --> 01:26:09,528
Nylon? That's DuPont.
I'll wear no monopoly.

1962
01:26:09,529 --> 01:26:12,264
They're also 50% cotton.
That'll help...

1963
01:26:12,265 --> 01:26:13,665
those sharecroppers
in Mississippi.

1964
01:26:13,666 --> 01:26:16,568
All right. Sit down.
Let's see how you eat.

1965
01:26:16,569 --> 01:26:19,471
Eat? That's the first
good idea he's had.

1966
01:26:19,472 --> 01:26:20,838
I'm starving.

1967
01:26:20,839 --> 01:26:22,173
No, not like that.

1968
01:26:22,174 --> 01:26:23,708
Start with the first course.

1969
01:26:23,709 --> 01:26:25,611
We have to teach him
some table manners.

1970
01:26:25,612 --> 01:26:27,912
No, no. One at a time.

1971
01:26:27,913 --> 01:26:30,149
And use the asparagus
tongs, darling.

1972
01:26:30,150 --> 01:26:31,149
The what?

1973
01:26:31,150 --> 01:26:32,913
Those little
grabbers over there.

1974
01:26:35,754 --> 01:26:37,439
Why can't I have my chicken?

1975
01:26:37,440 --> 01:26:39,123
- Luggage.
- OK. Fill those up...

1976
01:26:39,124 --> 01:26:40,592
and take them over to
the bridal suite at the Hilton.

1977
01:26:40,593 --> 01:26:42,060
You want initials on the bags?

1978
01:26:42,061 --> 01:26:44,096
Initials? He doesn't
even have a name yet.

1979
01:26:44,097 --> 01:26:45,256
No!

1980
01:26:45,931 --> 01:26:49,059
He's right, darling.
Always white wine with chicken.

1981
01:26:50,035 --> 01:26:52,170
Out of a glass, stupid.

1982
01:26:52,171 --> 01:26:54,305
Yeah, you know everything.

1983
01:26:54,306 --> 01:26:56,875
Which wine to drink,
which fork to use for fish...

1984
01:26:56,876 --> 01:26:59,445
which knife to stab the
proletariat in the back with.

1985
01:26:59,446 --> 01:27:02,081
How would you like
a little fruit for dessert?

1986
01:27:02,082 --> 01:27:04,082
The Count is waiting
in the office.

1987
01:27:04,083 --> 01:27:05,884
All right.
Scarlett, keep working on him.

1988
01:27:05,885 --> 01:27:07,720
Here, darling.
Use the finger bowl.

1989
01:27:07,721 --> 01:27:09,555
No, no. don't pack
his old clothes.

1990
01:27:09,556 --> 01:27:10,822
What shall we do with them?

1991
01:27:10,823 --> 01:27:12,424
Burn them, but first
have them disinfected.

1992
01:27:12,425 --> 01:27:13,424
Wait a minute!

1993
01:27:13,425 --> 01:27:15,394
My party membership book
is in there.

1994
01:27:15,395 --> 01:27:17,555
I'm paid up till December.

1995
01:27:30,809 --> 01:27:31,889
Sitzen machen.

1996
01:27:31,890 --> 01:27:32,970
Hello there.

1997
01:27:33,579 --> 01:27:36,231
Waldemar
von Droste-Schattenburg.

1998
01:27:36,232 --> 01:27:38,883
MacNamara
von Omaha, Nebraska.

1999
01:27:38,884 --> 01:27:41,103
Would you mind telling me
why I was summoned here?

2000
01:27:41,104 --> 01:27:43,322
Because every minute
I am away from my post...

2001
01:27:43,323 --> 01:27:44,707
it costs me two marks in tips.

2002
01:27:44,708 --> 01:27:46,090
OK. I'll lay it on the line.

2003
01:27:46,091 --> 01:27:47,993
How would you like
to become a father?

2004
01:27:47,994 --> 01:27:49,060
At my age?

2005
01:27:49,061 --> 01:27:51,029
There's a young man
I'd like you to adopt.

2006
01:27:51,030 --> 01:27:53,532
And the tip is
two thousand marks.

2007
01:27:53,533 --> 01:27:56,034
- Good day, sir.
- Hold on there, Count.

2008
01:27:56,035 --> 01:27:57,702
Just because I am reduced...

2009
01:27:57,703 --> 01:27:59,470
to earning
my living in a washroom...

2010
01:27:59,471 --> 01:28:01,756
does not mean that
I'm willing to peddle...

2011
01:28:01,757 --> 01:28:04,041
the honor and dignity
of my family name.

2012
01:28:04,042 --> 01:28:06,812
The von Droste-Schattenburgs
date back to the Second Crusade.

2013
01:28:06,813 --> 01:28:09,114
We have one of the oldest
bloodlines in Europe...

2014
01:28:09,115 --> 01:28:10,748
and one of the most inbred.

2015
01:28:10,749 --> 01:28:13,335
I am a direct descendant
of Philip the Bleeder.

2016
01:28:13,336 --> 01:28:15,921
So your proposition
is not only preposterous...

2017
01:28:15,922 --> 01:28:18,689
it is highly insulting.

2018
01:28:18,690 --> 01:28:21,026
- Make it ten thousand marks.
- I'll give you three thousand.

2019
01:28:21,027 --> 01:28:23,562
I just told you I come from
a long line of bleeders...

2020
01:28:23,563 --> 01:28:24,563
so don't cut the price.

2021
01:28:24,564 --> 01:28:25,563
Four thousand.

2022
01:28:25,564 --> 01:28:27,231
I will have you know...

2023
01:28:27,232 --> 01:28:30,169
that I am distantly related
to ex-King Farouk of Egypt.

2024
01:28:30,170 --> 01:28:31,169
Thirty-five hundred.

2025
01:28:31,170 --> 01:28:32,171
What happened to four thousand?

2026
01:28:32,172 --> 01:28:34,138
It's a deal.

2027
01:28:34,139 --> 01:28:35,640
Ingeborg, send Piffl in here.

2028
01:28:35,641 --> 01:28:39,077
For an additional 500 marks,
I will include the family crest.

2029
01:28:39,078 --> 01:28:42,514
What is it, two cakes of soap
on a field of paper towels?

2030
01:28:42,515 --> 01:28:45,716
A porcupine rampant
on a field of fleur-de-lis.

2031
01:28:45,717 --> 01:28:48,921
You may also have a photograph
of the Schattenburg Castle...

2032
01:28:48,922 --> 01:28:50,889
unfortunately destroyed
during the war.

2033
01:28:50,890 --> 01:28:51,889
American Air Force?

2034
01:28:51,890 --> 01:28:55,087
No. Turkish cavalry. 1682.

2035
01:28:55,594 --> 01:28:57,094
You can't just order me around...

2036
01:28:57,095 --> 01:28:58,796
"Come here, sit there,
do this, eat that!"

2037
01:28:58,797 --> 01:29:01,233
Darling, hold still.
I can't get your cuff link in.

2038
01:29:01,234 --> 01:29:03,185
Is this the lucky young man?

2039
01:29:03,186 --> 01:29:05,312
That's him.
Meet your father.

2040
01:29:05,313 --> 01:29:07,438
- My father?
- Ah, my dear boy.

2041
01:29:07,439 --> 01:29:09,541
I'm sure you will be
a credit to the family.

2042
01:29:09,542 --> 01:29:11,008
It could use a little credit.

2043
01:29:11,510 --> 01:29:13,678
- What is all this?
- You're being adopted.

2044
01:29:13,679 --> 01:29:17,049
Adopted? Just like that,
without even asking me?

2045
01:29:17,050 --> 01:29:19,168
This is not only devious,
it's unilateral.

2046
01:29:19,169 --> 01:29:21,285
My eye. What's the matter
with my eye?

2047
01:29:21,286 --> 01:29:24,122
- This is your daughter-in-law.
- Gndige Frau.

2048
01:29:24,123 --> 01:29:26,091
Scarlett, I've got
something in my eye!

2049
01:29:26,092 --> 01:29:28,744
It's a monocle.
Looks cute on you.

2050
01:29:28,745 --> 01:29:30,788
A monocle?
How sneaky can you get?

2051
01:29:30,789 --> 01:29:32,830
Go in there
and sign the papers...

2052
01:29:32,831 --> 01:29:35,033
and give this to the cashier
on the way out.

2053
01:29:35,034 --> 01:29:36,033
Thank you.

2054
01:29:36,034 --> 01:29:37,736
What do you think you're doing?

2055
01:29:37,737 --> 01:29:39,438
It's on the house, no charge.

2056
01:29:39,439 --> 01:29:41,235
Good-bye, my son.

2057
01:29:43,408 --> 01:29:45,843
Now, I want you kids to
memorize your new name.

2058
01:29:45,844 --> 01:29:48,747
You are the Count and Countess
von Droste-Schattenburg.

2059
01:29:48,748 --> 01:29:50,014
Count?

2060
01:29:50,015 --> 01:29:52,150
Countess! That means
everybody has to curtsy to me...

2061
01:29:52,151 --> 01:29:53,735
except maybe Grace Kelly.

2062
01:29:53,736 --> 01:29:55,319
Nobody will curtsy to you.

2063
01:29:55,320 --> 01:29:57,189
I refuse to join
the aristocracy.

2064
01:29:57,190 --> 01:29:58,256
They're all leeches...

2065
01:29:58,257 --> 01:29:59,808
bleeding
the underprivileged masses.

2066
01:29:59,809 --> 01:30:01,360
Not the
von Droste-Schattenburgs.

2067
01:30:01,361 --> 01:30:02,960
They bleed themselves.

2068
01:30:02,961 --> 01:30:04,630
Take him into the other room
and get him dressed.

2069
01:30:04,631 --> 01:30:06,030
And now that he's got a name...

2070
01:30:06,031 --> 01:30:07,866
there are some things
I want him to sign.

2071
01:30:07,867 --> 01:30:08,866
What things?

2072
01:30:08,867 --> 01:30:10,202
First, I'm turning over
my limousine...

2073
01:30:10,203 --> 01:30:11,269
and my chauffeur to you.

2074
01:30:11,270 --> 01:30:12,970
All I want is
my motorcycle back.

2075
01:30:12,971 --> 01:30:15,574
Whoever heard of
a countess in a sidecar?

2076
01:30:15,575 --> 01:30:17,008
Besides, where
will we put the baby?

2077
01:30:17,009 --> 01:30:18,477
And have him fill out
these applications...

2078
01:30:18,478 --> 01:30:19,510
golf club, Diners Club...

2079
01:30:19,511 --> 01:30:20,946
Blue Cross,
Book of the Month Club...

2080
01:30:20,947 --> 01:30:21,979
Fruit of the Month Club.

2081
01:30:21,980 --> 01:30:24,032
I will sign nothing.
I will join nothing.

2082
01:30:24,033 --> 01:30:26,084
But, darling,
it's the American way of life.

2083
01:30:26,085 --> 01:30:27,652
American way of life.

2084
01:30:27,653 --> 01:30:29,120
Unemployment, discrimination...

2085
01:30:29,121 --> 01:30:31,490
gangsterism,
juvenile delinquency...

2086
01:30:31,491 --> 01:30:33,859
but under
our new twenty-year plan...

2087
01:30:33,860 --> 01:30:35,227
we will catch up with you.

2088
01:30:35,228 --> 01:30:36,626
Lots of luck.

2089
01:30:37,129 --> 01:30:39,131
Ingeborg, get the manager
of the bottling plant...

2090
01:30:39,132 --> 01:30:40,398
up here right away...

2091
01:30:40,399 --> 01:30:42,424
and see if you can find me
a sign painter in a hurry.

2092
01:30:43,468 --> 01:30:44,992
What M.P.s?

2093
01:30:52,611 --> 01:30:54,011
What can I do for you boys?

2094
01:30:54,012 --> 01:30:55,180
Are you the head man
around here?

2095
01:30:55,181 --> 01:30:56,180
That's me.

2096
01:30:56,181 --> 01:30:57,516
We have a report
from one of our G.I.s...

2097
01:30:57,517 --> 01:30:58,617
you've got
a female employee here...

2098
01:30:58,618 --> 01:30:59,618
who's an enemy agent.

2099
01:30:59,619 --> 01:31:00,751
Enemy agent?

2100
01:31:00,752 --> 01:31:02,354
What would you call
a dame that's running around...

2101
01:31:02,355 --> 01:31:04,423
with "Yankee go home"
tattooed on her chest?

2102
01:31:04,424 --> 01:31:05,723
Somebody must be
pulling your leg.

2103
01:31:05,724 --> 01:31:08,327
Maybe and maybe not.
Mind if we look around?

2104
01:31:08,328 --> 01:31:10,179
Be my guest.

2105
01:31:10,180 --> 01:31:12,030
Oh, OK, buster.

2106
01:31:12,031 --> 01:31:13,019
Let's go.

2107
01:31:16,201 --> 01:31:17,234
You sent for me, sir?

2108
01:31:17,235 --> 01:31:18,636
Krause, as manager
of the bottling plant...

2109
01:31:18,637 --> 01:31:20,238
you're always complaining
that you need more help.

2110
01:31:20,239 --> 01:31:21,823
Yes, sir.
We're very busy downstairs.

2111
01:31:21,824 --> 01:31:23,408
You're going
to get an assistant.

2112
01:31:23,409 --> 01:31:24,408
- Who?
- You.

2113
01:31:24,409 --> 01:31:25,643
- Me?
- That's right.

2114
01:31:25,644 --> 01:31:27,045
The new manager
of the bottling plant...

2115
01:31:27,046 --> 01:31:28,647
is Otto von Droste-Schattenburg.

2116
01:31:28,648 --> 01:31:29,947
I refuse.

2117
01:31:29,948 --> 01:31:31,416
Your position may be lower,
but your pay will be higher.

2118
01:31:31,417 --> 01:31:32,416
I accept.

2119
01:31:32,417 --> 01:31:33,885
All right.
Into the conference room.

2120
01:31:33,886 --> 01:31:34,885
You've got fifteen minutes...

2121
01:31:34,886 --> 01:31:36,321
to teach this guy
everything you know...

2122
01:31:36,322 --> 01:31:37,489
about the bottling business.

2123
01:31:37,490 --> 01:31:38,657
I can't thank you enough.

2124
01:31:38,658 --> 01:31:39,657
Out.

2125
01:31:39,658 --> 01:31:41,493
Bertha, let me talk
to Mrs. MacNamara.

2126
01:31:41,494 --> 01:31:43,328
What do you mean
she packed up and left?

2127
01:31:43,329 --> 01:31:45,430
Mit die Kinder?
Where did they go?

2128
01:31:45,431 --> 01:31:48,024
Into a taxi.
Thanks a lot.

2129
01:31:48,867 --> 01:31:50,936
Mr. MacNamara, I don't want
to take up your time...

2130
01:31:50,937 --> 01:31:53,005
so if you'll just let me
talk to Miss Hazeltine.

2131
01:31:53,006 --> 01:31:54,005
About what?

2132
01:31:54,006 --> 01:31:56,375
About her marriage to
that Communist in East Berlin.

2133
01:31:56,376 --> 01:31:58,210
I'd like a statement
before we print the story.

2134
01:31:58,211 --> 01:32:00,045
There is no story,
and there's no Communist.

2135
01:32:00,046 --> 01:32:01,345
But we know she got married.

2136
01:32:01,346 --> 01:32:03,849
Sure she did, to Count Otto
von Droste-Schattenburg.

2137
01:32:03,850 --> 01:32:05,116
- Who?
- Otto the Bleeder.

2138
01:32:05,117 --> 01:32:07,502
Goes all the way
back to the Second Crusade...

2139
01:32:07,503 --> 01:32:09,888
a Turkish cavalry.
Here's the family castle.

2140
01:32:09,889 --> 01:32:11,323
Painter.

2141
01:32:11,324 --> 01:32:12,757
Oh...

2142
01:32:12,758 --> 01:32:14,453
come with me.

2143
01:32:17,729 --> 01:32:18,929
Sitzen machen.

2144
01:32:18,930 --> 01:32:21,366
I want you to paint this crest
on the door of a car.

2145
01:32:21,367 --> 01:32:23,198
How long will it take?
That's too long.

2146
01:32:23,199 --> 01:32:25,029
Look, my Mercedes
is parked downstairs.

2147
01:32:26,671 --> 01:32:28,139
Oh, excuse me.

2148
01:32:28,140 --> 01:32:29,407
- Miss Hazeltine?
- Yes?

2149
01:32:29,408 --> 01:32:31,143
How do you spell
your husband's name?

2150
01:32:31,144 --> 01:32:33,244
P- i-f-f-I.

2151
01:32:33,245 --> 01:32:35,781
Piffl? I thought it was
von Droste-Schattenburg.

2152
01:32:35,782 --> 01:32:37,366
Oh, that.
You mustn't believe...

2153
01:32:37,367 --> 01:32:38,950
everything
Mr. MacNamara tells you.

2154
01:32:38,951 --> 01:32:40,618
He fixed it all up...

2155
01:32:40,619 --> 01:32:43,221
so that Daddy wouldn't
find out Otto's a Red.

2156
01:32:43,222 --> 01:32:45,824
In the beginning,
I didn't like Mr. MacNamara...

2157
01:32:45,825 --> 01:32:47,191
but he's been just marvy.

2158
01:32:47,192 --> 01:32:48,793
That's enough
out of you, Countess.

2159
01:32:48,794 --> 01:32:50,929
- Did I say something wrong?
- Buzz off, will you?

2160
01:32:50,930 --> 01:32:52,630
You said there was no story...

2161
01:32:52,631 --> 01:32:53,964
and it's getting
better and better.

2162
01:32:53,965 --> 01:32:56,050
How much do you want
to forget the whole thing?

2163
01:32:56,051 --> 01:32:58,136
You think you can buy
a German newspaperman?

2164
01:32:58,137 --> 01:32:59,370
I never tried before.

2165
01:32:59,371 --> 01:33:01,173
Maybe in America your
journalists are for sale...

2166
01:33:01,174 --> 01:33:02,406
but here in Germany...

2167
01:33:02,407 --> 01:33:06,378
The adoption papers.
All signed and notarized.

2168
01:33:06,379 --> 01:33:08,179
Herr Oberleutnant.

2169
01:33:08,180 --> 01:33:09,180
You two know each other?

2170
01:33:09,181 --> 01:33:11,383
- He was my commanding officer.
- In the subway?

2171
01:33:11,384 --> 01:33:12,884
After that, when I was drafted.

2172
01:33:12,885 --> 01:33:14,186
Aha! Gestapo.

2173
01:33:14,187 --> 01:33:15,486
No, no. S.S.

2174
01:33:15,487 --> 01:33:17,422
Halten Sie doch
den Mund, Idiot.

2175
01:33:17,423 --> 01:33:19,023
Well, Herr Oberleutnant...

2176
01:33:19,024 --> 01:33:21,185
is there anything else
I can do for you?

2177
01:33:22,594 --> 01:33:25,097
No, thank you.
I have all the facts.

2178
01:33:25,098 --> 01:33:26,097
Union between two...

2179
01:33:26,098 --> 01:33:27,698
internationally
prominent families...

2180
01:33:27,699 --> 01:33:29,568
the Hazeltines and
the von Droste-Schattenburgs.

2181
01:33:29,569 --> 01:33:30,868
The social event of the year.

2182
01:33:30,869 --> 01:33:32,337
It will be
in the afternoon paper.

2183
01:33:32,338 --> 01:33:33,671
It had better be.

2184
01:33:33,672 --> 01:33:35,674
- Auf Wiedersehen.
- Sieg heil.

2185
01:33:35,675 --> 01:33:36,674
As for you, Schlemmer...

2186
01:33:36,675 --> 01:33:38,543
you're back
in the S.S.- smaller salary.

2187
01:33:38,544 --> 01:33:39,677
Sir, let me explain.

2188
01:33:39,678 --> 01:33:42,680
I was only a pastry cook
in the officers' mess.

2189
01:33:42,681 --> 01:33:45,083
Ingeborg, I want to speak
to the maitre d' at the Hilton.

2190
01:33:45,084 --> 01:33:47,449
I was a very bad pastry cook.

2191
01:33:49,287 --> 01:33:51,990
00. Where are the hats?
Where are the flowers?

2192
01:33:51,991 --> 01:33:54,692
- We're running behind schedule.
- Yes, sir.

2193
01:33:54,693 --> 01:33:56,995
Manfred, I'd like to arrange
an intimate little banquet...

2194
01:33:56,996 --> 01:33:59,227
the Count and Countess
von Droste-Schattenburg...

2195
01:33:59,228 --> 01:34:01,459
honoring his in-laws,
the Wendell P. Hazeltines.

2196
01:34:02,467 --> 01:34:04,201
You got a polka-dot dress?

2197
01:34:04,202 --> 01:34:08,406
Look, Frulein, haben Sie
eine tattoo on your, um...

2198
01:34:08,407 --> 01:34:09,566
glockenspiel?

2199
01:34:28,260 --> 01:34:29,628
Any broads working
in this office?

2200
01:34:29,629 --> 01:34:31,028
No, sir. Just me.

2201
01:34:31,029 --> 01:34:34,032
Look, Sarge, polka dots.
It fits the description.

2202
01:34:34,033 --> 01:34:36,034
- Hey, whose dress is that?
- I don't know.

2203
01:34:36,035 --> 01:34:37,113
I never saw it before.

2204
01:34:37,114 --> 01:34:38,191
We'd better check it out.

2205
01:34:42,040 --> 01:34:44,409
Corporal, I'm relieving
myself of duty.

2206
01:34:44,410 --> 01:34:45,843
Better take me back
to the base...

2207
01:34:45,844 --> 01:34:47,312
and turn me in
for psychiatric observation.

2208
01:34:47,313 --> 01:34:48,647
What's the matter, Sarge?

2209
01:34:48,648 --> 01:34:49,980
She's in there, all right.

2210
01:34:49,981 --> 01:34:52,283
I saw her-
naked as a jaybird.

2211
01:34:52,284 --> 01:34:54,452
Has she got the tattoo
on her chest?

2212
01:34:54,453 --> 01:34:55,986
So what's wrong, Sarge?

2213
01:34:55,987 --> 01:34:58,323
Fellas, you won't
believe this...

2214
01:34:58,324 --> 01:35:00,058
but one of them is yellow.

2215
01:35:00,059 --> 01:35:01,660
One of them is green.

2216
01:35:01,661 --> 01:35:03,560
Take me away!

2217
01:35:10,702 --> 01:35:13,370
For the entree, we'll have
venison and hominy grits.

2218
01:35:13,371 --> 01:35:16,241
How do I know where you get
hominy grits? Try the Army PX.

2219
01:35:16,242 --> 01:35:18,909
For dessert, peaches flambe
a la Hazeltine.

2220
01:35:18,910 --> 01:35:21,579
Wine, king-size Coca-Cola
in individual ice buckets.

2221
01:35:21,580 --> 01:35:24,248
Table decoration,
the von Droste-Schattenburg...

2222
01:35:24,249 --> 01:35:26,917
coat of arms with crossed flags,
German and Confederate.

2223
01:35:26,918 --> 01:35:29,654
Music, "Dixie," "Swanee River,"
"Waiting for the Robert E. Lee,"

2224
01:35:29,655 --> 01:35:32,456
but not, I repeat not,
"Marching Through Georgia."

2225
01:35:32,457 --> 01:35:35,160
You really want to make me
the boss of the bottling plant?

2226
01:35:35,161 --> 01:35:36,760
It's a must
so your father-in-law...

2227
01:35:36,761 --> 01:35:38,163
won't think you're
just a titled beatnik...

2228
01:35:38,164 --> 01:35:39,464
sponging off your wife.

2229
01:35:39,465 --> 01:35:40,764
I'm going to like this job.

2230
01:35:40,765 --> 01:35:42,199
It's about time you
started to cooperate.

2231
01:35:42,200 --> 01:35:44,852
You know what the first thing
is I'm going to do?

2232
01:35:44,853 --> 01:35:47,505
I'm going to lead the workers
down there in revolt!

2233
01:35:47,506 --> 01:35:49,996
Put your pants on, Spartacus.

2234
01:35:52,377 --> 01:35:53,544
Ingeborg, call the airport...

2235
01:35:53,545 --> 01:35:56,414
and find out if the 12:00
plane from London is on time.

2236
01:35:56,415 --> 01:35:57,779
Yes, Mr. MacNamara.

2237
01:36:07,659 --> 01:36:10,528
Soft drink slaves
of the world arise!

2238
01:36:10,529 --> 01:36:11,729
Smash those bottles...

2239
01:36:11,730 --> 01:36:13,897
pour that syrup
down the sewers...

2240
01:36:13,898 --> 01:36:16,534
- Remember me?
- Commissar Peripetchikoff.

2241
01:36:16,535 --> 01:36:18,102
Well.

2242
01:36:18,103 --> 01:36:19,421
Well is the one thing
I am not.

2243
01:36:19,422 --> 01:36:20,738
You are
a Russian commissar?

2244
01:36:20,739 --> 01:36:23,208
For the last time,
you have made fool of me!

2245
01:36:23,209 --> 01:36:25,075
He fooled me, too.
Listen, Commissar...

2246
01:36:25,076 --> 01:36:27,679
you must help me and my wife
get into the Soviet Zone.

2247
01:36:27,680 --> 01:36:29,046
There may be a little problem.

2248
01:36:29,047 --> 01:36:30,715
Yeah, everybody's
coming this way.

2249
01:36:30,716 --> 01:36:32,449
Fifteen hundred people a day.

2250
01:36:32,450 --> 01:36:34,018
You want to fight
all that traffic?

2251
01:36:34,019 --> 01:36:36,438
I'm a party member,
paid up till December.

2252
01:36:36,439 --> 01:36:38,856
They need me there.
I'm a missile scientist.

2253
01:36:38,857 --> 01:36:42,093
Ah, that is one field
where we're ahead of America.

2254
01:36:42,094 --> 01:36:44,129
In Cape Canaveral,
if missile goes wrong...

2255
01:36:44,130 --> 01:36:46,431
they press
special button and pow!

2256
01:36:46,432 --> 01:36:47,431
It blows up...

2257
01:36:47,432 --> 01:36:49,267
but in Russia,
we have two buttons.

2258
01:36:49,268 --> 01:36:50,267
Two buttons!

2259
01:36:50,268 --> 01:36:53,138
One to blow up missile,
one to blow up scientist.

2260
01:36:53,139 --> 01:36:54,906
What kind of
a commissar are you?

2261
01:36:54,907 --> 01:36:56,374
An ex-commissar.

2262
01:36:56,375 --> 01:36:57,841
You've defected?

2263
01:36:57,842 --> 01:37:00,644
Is old Russian proverb-
go west, young man.

2264
01:37:00,645 --> 01:37:02,497
What happened to your pals
Mishkin and Borodenko?

2265
01:37:02,498 --> 01:37:04,441
In ambulance on the way
from Brandenburg Gate...

2266
01:37:04,442 --> 01:37:06,384
I snitched Borodenko's
Secret Police badge...

2267
01:37:06,385 --> 01:37:07,969
and had them both arrested.

2268
01:37:07,970 --> 01:37:09,553
You betrayed your own comrades?

2269
01:37:09,554 --> 01:37:12,090
If I don't do it to them,
they do it to me.

2270
01:37:12,091 --> 01:37:14,025
Is old Russian proverb.

2271
01:37:14,026 --> 01:37:15,744
You're worse than he is.

2272
01:37:15,745 --> 01:37:17,461
Look, my young friend.

2273
01:37:17,462 --> 01:37:18,929
I don't want
to be name-dropper...

2274
01:37:18,930 --> 01:37:21,199
but what do you think
Khrushchev did to Malenkov?

2275
01:37:21,200 --> 01:37:23,601
What do you think
Stalin did to Trotsky?

2276
01:37:23,602 --> 01:37:25,704
Is everybody
in this world corrupt?

2277
01:37:25,705 --> 01:37:26,837
I don't know everybody.

2278
01:37:26,838 --> 01:37:29,307
Maybe we should liquidate
the whole human race...

2279
01:37:29,308 --> 01:37:30,792
and start all over again.

2280
01:37:30,793 --> 01:37:32,276
Look at it this way, kid.

2281
01:37:32,277 --> 01:37:34,696
Any world that can
produce the Taj Mahal...

2282
01:37:34,697 --> 01:37:37,115
William Shakespeare,
and striped toothpaste...

2283
01:37:37,116 --> 01:37:38,742
can't be all bad.

2284
01:37:40,385 --> 01:37:42,120
The trousers,
you can try them on.

2285
01:37:42,121 --> 01:37:43,120
Take him with you.

2286
01:37:43,121 --> 01:37:45,089
From now on, I fight alone.

2287
01:37:45,090 --> 01:37:47,926
It's Piffl against
everybody and everything!

2288
01:37:47,927 --> 01:37:49,460
See what I'm up against?

2289
01:37:49,461 --> 01:37:51,396
He can't even
remember his own name.

2290
01:37:51,397 --> 01:37:52,696
Get back to me...

2291
01:37:52,697 --> 01:37:53,731
What do you want-money?

2292
01:37:53,732 --> 01:37:55,866
Certainly not.
I will be rich man now.

2293
01:37:55,867 --> 01:37:57,802
You remember those
twenty carloads of Swiss cheese?

2294
01:37:57,803 --> 01:38:00,137
- What about them?
- I have tremendous scheme.

2295
01:38:00,138 --> 01:38:02,507
I will trade them for
twenty carloads of sauerkraut...

2296
01:38:02,508 --> 01:38:03,975
then I will silver-plate
the sauerkraut...

2297
01:38:03,976 --> 01:38:05,076
and sell it
in the United States...

2298
01:38:05,077 --> 01:38:06,911
for Christmas tree decorations.

2299
01:38:06,912 --> 01:38:08,011
You're a cinch.

2300
01:38:08,012 --> 01:38:11,716
But I need bilingual secretary,
and you promised me blond lady.

2301
01:38:11,717 --> 01:38:13,083
You came at the right time...

2302
01:38:13,084 --> 01:38:14,918
because I'm moving
to London anyway.

2303
01:38:14,919 --> 01:38:17,183
I don't know how to
break the news to her.

2304
01:38:18,256 --> 01:38:19,690
Ingeborg!

2305
01:38:19,691 --> 01:38:22,125
It's not going to be easy.
She's crazy about me.

2306
01:38:22,794 --> 01:38:23,794
Yes, Mr. MacNamara.

2307
01:38:23,795 --> 01:38:26,063
A classified ad
to run in all papers.

2308
01:38:26,064 --> 01:38:29,768
International businessman-
overweight but cute...

2309
01:38:29,769 --> 01:38:31,869
needs executive secretary.

2310
01:38:31,870 --> 01:38:34,304
Fringe benefits include
extensive travel...

2311
01:38:34,305 --> 01:38:38,042
large wardrobe allowance,
liberal retirement plan...

2312
01:38:38,043 --> 01:38:39,043
I take the job.

2313
01:38:39,044 --> 01:38:40,043
You've got it.

2314
01:38:40,044 --> 01:38:41,979
Good-bye. Good luck.

2315
01:38:41,980 --> 01:38:43,781
And what about that
call to Templehof?

2316
01:38:43,782 --> 01:38:45,583
The plane will be
ten minutes early.

2317
01:38:45,584 --> 01:38:46,617
10 minutes early?

2318
01:38:46,618 --> 01:38:48,602
That's a hell of a way
to run an airline.

2319
01:38:48,603 --> 01:38:50,586
Planes are supposed
to be late, not early.

2320
01:38:52,924 --> 01:38:56,027
Oh, I never
want to see him again.

2321
01:38:56,028 --> 01:38:57,722
I never want to speak to him.

2322
01:38:58,863 --> 01:39:00,230
I want a divorce.

2323
01:39:00,231 --> 01:39:01,799
What's the matter now?

2324
01:39:01,800 --> 01:39:03,367
He doesn't want the baby.

2325
01:39:03,368 --> 01:39:05,370
He says nobody
should bring children...

2326
01:39:05,371 --> 01:39:06,688
into a world like this.

2327
01:39:06,689 --> 01:39:08,005
That miserable punk.

2328
01:39:08,006 --> 01:39:09,807
Why didn't he think
of that before?

2329
01:39:09,808 --> 01:39:12,310
After all I've gone through.
Where is he?

2330
01:39:12,311 --> 01:39:14,713
I'm sorry, darling.
I didn't mean it.

2331
01:39:14,714 --> 01:39:17,115
Of course we're going
to have the baby.

2332
01:39:17,116 --> 01:39:18,949
I love you.

2333
01:39:18,950 --> 01:39:21,214
don't ever scare me
like that again.

2334
01:39:22,220 --> 01:39:25,523
Maybe our children can make this
a better place to live in...

2335
01:39:25,524 --> 01:39:28,159
a world where men
are created equal...

2336
01:39:28,160 --> 01:39:30,794
and there's liberty
and justice for all.

2337
01:39:30,795 --> 01:39:33,298
Congratulations. You just
quoted Thomas Jefferson...

2338
01:39:33,299 --> 01:39:34,398
Abraham Lincoln...

2339
01:39:34,399 --> 01:39:36,468
and the Pledge of
Allegiance to the Flag.

2340
01:39:36,469 --> 01:39:37,730
I what?

2341
01:39:40,338 --> 01:39:42,397
Come on. Let's get going.

2342
01:39:50,014 --> 01:39:51,349
I take it into the other
room and fix it.

2343
01:39:51,350 --> 01:39:52,907
We haven't got time.
Come with us.

2344
01:39:54,752 --> 01:39:56,382
Schlemmer!

2345
01:39:56,383 --> 01:39:58,012
Sitzen machen.

2346
01:40:00,492 --> 01:40:01,492
Blumen.

2347
01:40:01,493 --> 01:40:04,189
Here. This is
for your mother-in-law.

2348
01:40:16,975 --> 01:40:18,533
Hutte.

2349
01:40:23,381 --> 01:40:26,373
In front.
You, paint from the inside.

2350
01:40:28,119 --> 01:40:30,246
Quick, to the airport.
Eins, zwei, drei.

2351
01:40:37,695 --> 01:40:41,165
All right!
Watch that umbrella.

2352
01:40:41,166 --> 01:40:42,566
No, I don't like it.

2353
01:40:42,567 --> 01:40:44,636
Here. You need some stuff
for your pockets.

2354
01:40:44,637 --> 01:40:47,738
Money, cigarette case...

2355
01:40:47,739 --> 01:40:50,275
lighter,
picture of the castle.

2356
01:40:50,276 --> 01:40:52,042
Try this one, darling.

2357
01:40:52,043 --> 01:40:54,341
You'd better take
my wristwatch, too.

2358
01:40:56,347 --> 01:40:57,415
Oh, that's my wrist.

2359
01:40:57,416 --> 01:40:58,682
Oh.

2360
01:40:58,683 --> 01:40:59,951
You know, darling,
I don't think...

2361
01:40:59,952 --> 01:41:01,418
you were meant to wear a hat.

2362
01:41:01,419 --> 01:41:04,354
I wasn't meant
to be a count, either.

2363
01:41:04,355 --> 01:41:06,574
This is ridiculous.
Who's going to believe it?

2364
01:41:06,575 --> 01:41:09,299
Calm down. The only royalty
we know in America...

2365
01:41:09,300 --> 01:41:12,024
is Nat King Cole,
Duke Snyder, and Earl Wilson.

2366
01:41:24,776 --> 01:41:26,676
Oh, pardon.

2367
01:41:30,214 --> 01:41:32,400
Please, Liebchen, not that.
Anything but that.

2368
01:41:32,401 --> 01:41:34,586
All right. Let's see
if we have a black bowler.

2369
01:41:34,587 --> 01:41:35,586
Bowler, bowler.

2370
01:41:35,587 --> 01:41:36,721
Here's a list
of what you owe me.

2371
01:41:36,722 --> 01:41:38,088
- Owe you?
- All itemized.

2372
01:41:38,089 --> 01:41:39,874
Mercedes limousine,
twenty thousand marks.

2373
01:41:39,875 --> 01:41:41,658
Cost of adoption,
forty-five hundred marks.

2374
01:41:41,659 --> 01:41:43,728
Suits, haberdashery, shoes,
et cetera, et cetera...

2375
01:41:43,729 --> 01:41:45,162
12,800 marks.

2376
01:41:45,163 --> 01:41:47,865
Luggage, flowers,
7- course dinner, 925 marks.

2377
01:41:47,866 --> 01:41:50,151
Haircut and manicure,
fourteen marks.

2378
01:41:50,152 --> 01:41:52,436
Tips, six marks.
I'm a very large tipper.

2379
01:41:52,437 --> 01:41:55,340
Wristwatch, cigarette case,
lighter with fluid, 2,200 marks.

2380
01:41:55,341 --> 01:41:57,174
Loose change, 475 marks.

2381
01:41:57,175 --> 01:42:01,411
Total, 41,020 marks, or $10,255.

2382
01:42:01,412 --> 01:42:03,514
You mean I have been
a capitalist for three hours...

2383
01:42:03,515 --> 01:42:04,815
and already I owe $10,000?

2384
01:42:04,816 --> 01:42:06,084
That's what makes
our system work.

2385
01:42:06,085 --> 01:42:07,652
Everybody owes everybody.

2386
01:42:07,653 --> 01:42:09,244
That's the one!

2387
01:42:10,088 --> 01:42:12,113
Doesn't it look distinguished?

2388
01:42:12,724 --> 01:42:13,884
Not bad.

2389
01:42:14,926 --> 01:42:17,053
46. Faster, Fritz!

2390
01:42:21,699 --> 01:42:23,767
Before you meet Daddy,
I'd better warn you...

2391
01:42:23,768 --> 01:42:25,903
there are certain things
he feels very strongly about.

2392
01:42:25,904 --> 01:42:28,038
One is the Civil War.

2393
01:42:28,039 --> 01:42:30,008
If the subject comes up,
just say it was a draw.

2394
01:42:30,009 --> 01:42:31,008
Another is Coca-Cola.

2395
01:42:31,009 --> 01:42:32,677
Tell him we must
look beyond the six-pack.

2396
01:42:32,678 --> 01:42:34,379
Why not a nine-pack
or a twelve-pack?

2397
01:42:34,380 --> 01:42:35,579
Then there's golf.

2398
01:42:35,580 --> 01:42:37,682
Golf, the family that plays
together stays together.

2399
01:42:37,683 --> 01:42:39,082
And the world situation...

2400
01:42:39,083 --> 01:42:40,084
It's serious, but not hopeless.

2401
01:42:40,085 --> 01:42:41,518
And vivisection.

2402
01:42:41,519 --> 01:42:42,619
It shouldn't happen to a dog.

2403
01:42:42,620 --> 01:42:45,657
And Red China and income taxes
and Tennessee Williams.

2404
01:42:45,658 --> 01:42:47,725
Wait! Stop the car.
It's no use.

2405
01:42:47,726 --> 01:42:49,026
I can't remember all that.

2406
01:42:49,027 --> 01:42:51,029
Darling, you can't give up now.

2407
01:42:51,030 --> 01:42:52,029
Maybe we'll get lucky.

2408
01:42:52,030 --> 01:42:54,089
Maybe somebody
hijacked the plane.

2409
01:43:08,146 --> 01:43:10,364
Now, honey, you let me
handle this young man.

2410
01:43:10,365 --> 01:43:12,583
It'll take me just
thirty seconds to find out...

2411
01:43:12,584 --> 01:43:14,052
if he's one of those
fortune hunters...

2412
01:43:14,053 --> 01:43:15,453
or some kind of a crackpot.

2413
01:43:15,454 --> 01:43:16,820
Oh, dear. I hope not.

2414
01:43:16,821 --> 01:43:18,456
You don't know these Europeans.

2415
01:43:18,457 --> 01:43:20,822
My poor honey child.

2416
01:43:20,823 --> 01:43:23,187
Where are they anyway?

2417
01:43:39,377 --> 01:43:41,641
Tear them again,
and I'll tear you apart.

2418
01:43:47,685 --> 01:43:49,175
Scarlett!

2419
01:43:57,428 --> 01:43:58,428
Mother!

2420
01:43:58,429 --> 01:43:59,997
Let me look at you.

2421
01:43:59,998 --> 01:44:01,832
Dad.

2422
01:44:01,833 --> 01:44:03,801
All right. Now, where is he?

2423
01:44:03,802 --> 01:44:05,496
Over here.

2424
01:44:08,239 --> 01:44:09,857
I want you to meet
my husband Otto.

2425
01:44:09,858 --> 01:44:11,476
The Count
von Droste-Schattenburg.

2426
01:44:11,477 --> 01:44:12,477
Count von what?

2427
01:44:12,478 --> 01:44:14,129
This is my mother.

2428
01:44:14,130 --> 01:44:15,779
Your highness.

2429
01:44:15,780 --> 01:44:17,714
Please, not in
the immediate family.

2430
01:44:18,716 --> 01:44:20,752
Oh, one of those-a hand-kisser.

2431
01:44:20,753 --> 01:44:22,085
And this is my father.

2432
01:44:22,086 --> 01:44:23,587
Hello, Dad.
How's your golf?

2433
01:44:23,588 --> 01:44:25,256
I always say, the family
that plays together...

2434
01:44:25,257 --> 01:44:26,423
Never mind that.

2435
01:44:26,424 --> 01:44:28,191
There are a few questions
I want to ask you.

2436
01:44:28,192 --> 01:44:30,261
don't worry. If it's a boy,
we'll name him after you.

2437
01:44:30,262 --> 01:44:32,263
Wendell P.
von Droste-Schattenburg.

2438
01:44:32,264 --> 01:44:33,263
Von Droste what?

2439
01:44:33,264 --> 01:44:35,700
We have to be very careful when
we change the baby's diapers.

2440
01:44:35,701 --> 01:44:37,268
Otto comes from
a long line of bleeders.

2441
01:44:37,269 --> 01:44:38,602
Oh, isn't that nice?

2442
01:44:38,603 --> 01:44:40,304
I always wanted
Scarlett to be married...

2443
01:44:40,305 --> 01:44:42,105
to a long line of something.

2444
01:44:42,106 --> 01:44:44,242
Now, MacNamara, tell me
about this young man.

2445
01:44:44,243 --> 01:44:45,627
Who is he,
and what does he do...

2446
01:44:45,628 --> 01:44:47,010
besides slobber
over women's hands?

2447
01:44:47,011 --> 01:44:49,213
don't let that title fool you.
He works for a living.

2448
01:44:49,214 --> 01:44:50,380
Doing what?

2449
01:44:50,381 --> 01:44:52,550
As a matter of fact,
he's head of our bottling plant.

2450
01:44:52,551 --> 01:44:53,550
He works for us?

2451
01:44:53,551 --> 01:44:55,386
Best man I ever had.
Graduate engineer.

2452
01:44:55,387 --> 01:44:56,386
Took a lot of finagling...

2453
01:44:56,387 --> 01:44:57,889
to get him away
from our competitors.

2454
01:44:57,890 --> 01:44:59,584
You don't say.

2455
01:45:00,358 --> 01:45:02,553
Now, this is a picture
of the family castle.

2456
01:45:03,561 --> 01:45:05,263
And this is my
party membership-oops.

2457
01:45:05,264 --> 01:45:06,263
Wrong party.

2458
01:45:06,264 --> 01:45:08,265
And here's the family crest.

2459
01:45:08,266 --> 01:45:11,169
You'll have to put that
on all your stationery...

2460
01:45:11,170 --> 01:45:13,455
and your silverware
and your underwear...

2461
01:45:13,456 --> 01:45:15,515
Well, son, glad
to have you on the team.

2462
01:45:15,516 --> 01:45:17,575
I suppose you two met
in the bottling plant.

2463
01:45:17,576 --> 01:45:18,942
No. We met in a parade.

2464
01:45:18,943 --> 01:45:20,344
He was carrying
a picture of Khrushchev.

2465
01:45:20,345 --> 01:45:21,344
Khrushchev?

2466
01:45:21,345 --> 01:45:24,015
Yes, with a big slogan
on it-"Russki go home!"

2467
01:45:24,016 --> 01:45:25,616
They threw him in jail for it.

2468
01:45:25,617 --> 01:45:26,616
My poor boy.

2469
01:45:26,617 --> 01:45:28,085
How is the situation
here in Berlin?

2470
01:45:28,086 --> 01:45:30,188
It shouldn't happen to a dog.

2471
01:45:30,189 --> 01:45:32,055
I mean it's a draw.

2472
01:45:32,056 --> 01:45:36,093
Actually, the situation
is hopeless but not serious.

2473
01:45:36,094 --> 01:45:37,894
Hopeless but not...

2474
01:45:37,895 --> 01:45:40,431
Say, the boy's got a head
on his shoulders.

2475
01:45:40,432 --> 01:45:41,698
What did I tell you?

2476
01:45:41,699 --> 01:45:44,099
May I have those? Fritz...

2477
01:45:45,903 --> 01:45:47,204
Next. Schlemmer!

2478
01:45:47,205 --> 01:45:50,374
Take these to passport control.
One, two, three.

2479
01:45:50,375 --> 01:45:51,942
Next! Mom, Dad...

2480
01:45:51,943 --> 01:45:53,377
I'm giving a little
banquet tonight.

2481
01:45:53,378 --> 01:45:55,046
Un petit diner en famille.

2482
01:45:55,047 --> 01:45:56,631
Oh, he speaks French, too.

2483
01:45:56,632 --> 01:45:58,458
- And Russian.
- Russian?

2484
01:45:58,459 --> 01:46:00,283
White Russian, of course.

2485
01:46:00,284 --> 01:46:01,752
Now, Dad, there
are a few ideas...

2486
01:46:01,753 --> 01:46:03,220
I'd like to kick
around with you.

2487
01:46:03,221 --> 01:46:05,389
Now, we must look
beyond the six-pack.

2488
01:46:05,390 --> 01:46:07,775
Why not a nine-pack
or a twelve-pack?

2489
01:46:07,776 --> 01:46:10,732
Pan American Flight 17
to New York...

2490
01:46:10,733 --> 01:46:13,688
via Frankfurt
now boarding at Gate Five.

2491
01:46:22,907 --> 01:46:23,907
Phyllis!

2492
01:46:23,908 --> 01:46:26,377
Mac! You came through 100%.

2493
01:46:26,378 --> 01:46:27,377
I did what I could.

2494
01:46:27,378 --> 01:46:28,579
Now I'm sure I found
the right man...

2495
01:46:28,580 --> 01:46:29,747
for the London job.

2496
01:46:29,748 --> 01:46:30,915
Thanks, Mr. Hazeltine.

2497
01:46:30,916 --> 01:46:32,082
It's just what we need...

2498
01:46:32,083 --> 01:46:33,250
somebody who's
a good organizer...

2499
01:46:33,251 --> 01:46:34,752
has a lot of drive,
knows the business...

2500
01:46:34,753 --> 01:46:35,752
speaks several languages.

2501
01:46:35,753 --> 01:46:37,787
Well, I studied
every chance I had.

2502
01:46:37,788 --> 01:46:39,689
Absolutely the ideal man
for this position.

2503
01:46:39,690 --> 01:46:42,420
And I'm not just saying that
because he's my son-in-law.

2504
01:46:43,194 --> 01:46:44,194
How's that?

2505
01:46:44,195 --> 01:46:46,230
It's not going to
hurt our prestige any.

2506
01:46:46,231 --> 01:46:47,397
Head of European operations...

2507
01:46:47,398 --> 01:46:49,834
Count Otto
von Droste-Schattenburg.

2508
01:46:49,835 --> 01:46:50,934
Oh, that's how it is.

2509
01:46:50,935 --> 01:46:52,820
As for you, Mac, you
haven't been forgotten.

2510
01:46:52,821 --> 01:46:54,497
You're going all the way
to the top now.

2511
01:46:54,498 --> 01:46:56,236
There's an opening
in the home office...

2512
01:46:56,237 --> 01:46:57,975
vice president in charge
of procurement...

2513
01:46:57,976 --> 01:46:59,009
and it is all yours.

2514
01:46:59,010 --> 01:47:00,410
Why are you so good to me?

2515
01:47:00,411 --> 01:47:02,613
I know you must be dying
to get back to Atlanta.

2516
01:47:02,614 --> 01:47:04,147
Dying is right.

2517
01:47:04,148 --> 01:47:07,084
Here you are, Count.
I won't be needing this anymore.

2518
01:47:07,085 --> 01:47:08,219
Thank you, old chap.

2519
01:47:08,220 --> 01:47:09,219
Bye, Countess.

2520
01:47:09,220 --> 01:47:12,678
Mr. MacNamara,
I simply adore you.

2521
01:47:13,224 --> 01:47:15,042
- Will you write to us?
- Better than that.

2522
01:47:15,043 --> 01:47:16,861
I'll send you some
silver-plated sauerkraut...

2523
01:47:16,862 --> 01:47:18,385
for Christmas.

2524
01:47:25,736 --> 01:47:26,903
Mom, can we have a Coke?

2525
01:47:26,904 --> 01:47:29,607
You can have one on the plane.
I don't have any change.

2526
01:47:29,608 --> 01:47:31,574
- I've got change.
- Mac!

2527
01:47:31,575 --> 01:47:33,600
Very nice of you to come
down here to see me off.

2528
01:47:35,846 --> 01:47:36,897
Where are you going?

2529
01:47:36,898 --> 01:47:37,948
Back to the States.

2530
01:47:37,949 --> 01:47:40,350
Funny, that's where we're going.

2531
01:47:40,351 --> 01:47:42,185
I thought I'd take
Flight 17 to New York.

2532
01:47:42,186 --> 01:47:44,088
From there I can hop
a freedom bus to Atlanta.

2533
01:47:44,089 --> 01:47:45,722
Atlanta?

2534
01:47:45,723 --> 01:47:48,225
I'm the new vice president
in charge of bottle caps.

2535
01:47:48,226 --> 01:47:50,060
They're kicking me upstairs.

2536
01:47:50,061 --> 01:47:51,979
That's something I've
always wanted to do myself.

2537
01:47:51,980 --> 01:47:53,898
So anytime you and the kids
would care to join me...

2538
01:47:53,899 --> 01:47:55,780
I'll be waiting for you.

2539
01:47:55,781 --> 01:47:57,661
Just a minute. Conference.

2540
01:48:00,638 --> 01:48:02,673
Two out of three. Deal is on.

2541
01:48:02,674 --> 01:48:04,007
Two out of three?

2542
01:48:04,008 --> 01:48:06,476
All right.
Who's the wise guy?

2543
01:48:15,987 --> 01:48:17,614
Schlemmer!
