1
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:06,388
Let's go, people! Letters are fading.
Larry, we have five seconds.

2
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:10,399
- How's the placement of the letters?
- Fine. Did you keep that in shot?

3
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,436
OK, Hal. Where's Hal?

4
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,590
I can hold it
for a few more seconds...

5
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:17,558
Can we get first team on set?
The letters are fading.

6
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,598
Come on, guys, we gotta go.
She looks great.

7
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,636
Come on. Please, please.

8
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,633
Quick review, Nicole. You get out of
the car, run up past the sculpture,

9
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,676
you see the skywriting says, "Help",

10
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:32,912
and you realise everything has gone
wrong and you can't believe it.

11
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,949
But everything's chaos now, so what
I need you to project is despair.

12
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,270
- I need...
- We're losing it.

13
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:44,319
OK. So, what I need from you, I
wanna feel the whole human condition.

14
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,152
Lock it up!

15
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,316
Yo, yo! Yo!

16
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,188
- Could you stop for five minutes?
- What's that say, "Help"?

17
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,475
- Roll camera!
- Camera's rolling!

18
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,516
- Speed!
- A little higher.

19
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,670
Scene 121, take one. Mark!

20
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,830
And action!

21
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,434
Faster, faster, faster.

22
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:11,036
You're moving like a zombie. Come on!
Yes, OK, hit the mark. Look up.

23
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,032
Come on, come on, and... Good.

24
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,680
Cut! We cut! Thank you, everyone.

25
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,990
Thank you so much, that was amazing.

26
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:23,073
Your body language, it's just
emotional, everything you do.

27
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:26,869
Now I know why you get the big bucks,
cos you make me look so great!

28
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,474
I have Camp David here.
It's about the ring.

29
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,516
Mary, you're on with Nicole.

30
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,555
Hello?

31
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:37,077
- Sorry to bug you on the phone...
- Should I sign the thing?

32
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:40,709
- My voucher?
- Sure. Daniel, can we get a voucher?

33
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,756
- Did they get the shot?
- Yeah.

34
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,195
Wardrobe, right?
This is our wardrobe?

35
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,511
Where do I know you from?
I know you, right? I mean...

36
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,999
Thanks.

37
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,356
Chippers, in Soho. I waited on you.

38
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:57,831
Well, what a great memory. That was,
like, a couple of months ago.

39
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,310
But I remember the face
for sure, and...

40
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:05,996
- And you're an actress.
- I'm an extra. A face in the crowd.

41
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,310
I'm gonna get my sweatshirt.

42
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,437
So, er, when do you get off work?

43
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:18,355
Was that gorgeous black girl you came
with that night your girlfriend?

44
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:21,796
That was a guy in drag.
What are you talking about?

45
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:25,555
- Whatever it was, it was beautiful.
- I was interviewing.

46
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:30,270
I did a piece on transvestites,
which is why you saw my girlfriend.

47
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,316
Well, in answer to your question,

48
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,154
if you're ever in the neighbourhood,
I get off around midnight.

49
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,634
Oh, you need a...

50
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,439
- Excuse me, can I borrow...
- Yeah, sure.

51
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,511
Tell me how close I am.

52
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,036
You are from rich parents,
you're seeing a shrink,

53
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,475
and you're dyslexic, right?

54
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,357
Thanks.

55
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,477
- Well... That was good.
- I try.

56
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,314
My father's wealthy,
I am seeing a shrink,

57
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,790
and I'm an insomniac,
so you're in the ballpark.

58
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,838
When you waited on us,
you had this amazing look.

59
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:11,388
I thought,
"Boy, trouble for somebody!"

60
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:15,951
I think I dreamt about you. Really,
I remember your face. Who wouldn't?

61
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,600
Do me a favour, sign your voucher.

62
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,715
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

63
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,676
- Lee!
- Excuse me.

64
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,512
Over here.

65
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,433
Sandy, you send those truffles
to the president.

66
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,796
Seven o'clock, tomorrow morning,
in the park. Thank you.

67
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,871
- Nicole, here he is.
- I'm sorry.

68
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:43,033
- Are you ready for our tête-à-tête?
- Yes, I have everything at hand.

69
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,635
- Bill Gaines. Nicole's press agent.
- Oh, great.

70
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,553
Look, if you could,
let's not dwell on the bulimia.

71
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,029
Really, this is about
lots of things.

72
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,475
You promised you'd show me
where you grew up.

73
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,993
I did.

74
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,234
- It's great that we can do this.
- It is great.

75
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,880
It's so kind of you to show me.

76
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:15,509
A lot of people get
kind of nervous about this stuff.

77
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,352
Hello?

78
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,875
Hello, I'm sorry to disturb you.
This lady used to live here.

79
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,916
As a child.

80
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,514
She's Nicole Oliver,
she's a great actress.

81
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:34,957
- What do you want?
- He's writing an article about me,

82
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,395
and I wanted to show him
where I used to live.

83
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,950
Like, for five minutes.
It would be great for the magazine.

84
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:44,316
- Come in and look around.
- Thank you, this is great.

85
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,039
- Look at how tiny her feet are.
- Yeah.

86
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,954
This is where it began. Did you have
feet like that when you were here?

87
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:55,830
This is... I guess...
strange for you, I guess?

88
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,275
It's changed, I think.

89
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:01,511
- I hope it's changed.
- It feels like it's smaller.

90
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,556
Smaller? That often happens.

91
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:06,200
How long have you lived here?

92
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:09,033
Never mind. Do you think
we could go upstairs?

93
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,270
- That'd be great.
- Whatever you want.

94
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,316
- Is that OK?
- I don't care.

95
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,994
- Great. Thank you, thank you.
- Thank you.

96
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:21,998
I had this whole wall here plastered
with movie star photos.

97
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,832
- Really?
- Yeah.

98
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,992
And I would dream about being in
a movie with Warren Beatty.

99
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,150
- Nice dream.
- Yeah.

100
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:35,553
And I remember I used to lay on my
bed naked, and watch my body develop.

101
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:39,112
- Naked.
- And I would pray...

102
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,078
that my breasts and my legs
would be beautiful,

103
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,799
so that I could be an actress.

104
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:50,159
You cut a very erotic figure
reclining like that, I have to say.

105
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:55,279
Well, fortunately
I did mature quickly.

106
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,751
I remember my brothers used to
spy on me when I was taking a shower,

107
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,877
or they would rub
themselves up against me.

108
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:07,350
I empathise with them,
totally. Really.

109
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,192
Please.

110
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,430
- No?
- No. Married.

111
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,476
- Happily?
- Very.

112
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,710
OK.

113
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,360
I'm not saying that we don't have to
work at it.

114
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:21,876
You have to work at it if you want
fidelity in your relationship.

115
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:25,748
Have you ever given way to unbridled
lust in this room

116
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:29,674
and really let yourself go
in a big way?

117
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,916
I can't sleep with you.

118
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,355
You can't sleep with me. I know that.

119
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,396
Understand that I had to...

120
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:43,473
The proximity is thrilling
and irresistible.

121
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:46,313
I'm not saying that
I don't find you attractive.

122
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,358
- You're very kind.
- I find you very attractive.

123
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,115
There are certain things that I won't
do to my husband out of commitment.

124
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,156
I hear you.

125
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:59,518
I could never have intercourse with
anyone other than Phil.

126
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,750
My body belongs to my husband.

127
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,956
I understand, and I...

128
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,510
What I do from the neck up,
that's a different story.

129
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:23,519
So, after your nomination you formed
a production company, right?

130
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,353
Right. You have to develop
your own projects.

131
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,716
You cannot imagine the amount
of crap that I get sent.

132
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,878
- Plus, I would like to direct.
- Really?

133
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:39,159
I don't wanna be pushy, but I have
a screenplay which I've written

134
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:43,677
and it occurred to me today
that it might be perfect for you.

135
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,512
- Yeah?
- Really.

136
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,989
Right now it's a vehicle for a man,

137
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,595
but it could so easily be
rewritten for a woman.

138
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,433
- What's it about?
- It's an armoured car robbery,

139
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,875
but with a very strong
personal crisis.

140
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:00,589
- Who would I play?
- You'd be a guard on the car.

141
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:04,355
It needs a rewrite, but there's room
for a real feminist statement.

142
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:07,079
I know you're very active
politically.

143
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:11,472
I think it could work so well.
I've been working on it for a year

144
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:14,996
and I can't make any real progress
unless a star is involved,

145
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,275
and someone like you, it would be...

146
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,558
- Have you given it to any actors?
- Yeah, but their agents turn it down

147
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:25,474
because I have no track record
as a screenwriter,

148
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:29,314
although the script has had
a terrific reaction from people.

149
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,356
- Let me think about it.
- Really?

150
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:36,592
Great, cos I wanna be...
I think you'd enjoy it.

151
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:39,672
- No, no, no. Let me think about it.
- Sure.

152
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:59,917
He's coming! Come this way,
everybody! Come this way, everybody!

153
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,150
- It's him! Come on!
- Oh, my gosh!

154
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,277
We watch you every Sunday on TV!

155
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,557
- We wouldn't miss it for the world!
- Good to see you.

156
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,110
- Are you gonna stay here long?
- As long as I can, yes.

157
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:15,670
Father Gladden is our special guest,
direct from TV.

158
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,957
My daughter just got a prize
at school for her charity work.

159
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,874
- She'd love an autograph from you.
- Entrance into the kingdom of God

160
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:26,111
is determined by our response
to the neighbour in need.

161
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,794
- I don't know what I'm doing here.
- Relax!

162
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,189
I was exactly that way at first.

163
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:35,114
Yeah, but my room is so spare.
You know, with a Bible?

164
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,953
- And the water is brown.
- I told the handyman.

165
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,110
I know what you're going through!

166
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,192
When my husband left me
for his secretary, I was lost.

167
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,635
Someone said,
"You were raised a Catholic,

168
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:48,075
"how could you even
contemplate a hit man?"

169
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,913
- They told me about this retreat.
- I'm not religious.

170
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,070
You think I led a religious life?

171
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,549
I've had two divorces
and two abortions.

172
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:59,474
But just to take a break from
the chaos of the city to reflect.

173
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:03,109
No, no. I mean, the water
comes out brown in my room.

174
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,156
And the bed, it's so hard.

175
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:08,994
You've had a trauma. Psychotherapy
hasn't helped, pills haven't helped.

176
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:12,914
What you need is time and quiet.
Your emotions have to settle.

177
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:18,309
Thought of going back to teaching.
Completely lost my taste for it.

178
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,594
Simplify.

179
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,070
Who would you say is more popular -
the Pope or Elvis Presley?

180
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:26,311
I don't think there's any doubt.
Elvis, you think?

181
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:29,358
Did you agree with The Beatles
at the height of their fame

182
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,590
that they were bigger stars
than Jesus?

183
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,990
- World population was less then...
- May I have your autograph?

184
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,640
The food is the worst. What is this?

185
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,836
I don't know. Shoe leather?

186
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,912
- You don't have to eat it.
- I asked for it rare.

187
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,232
- I know, but you don't like meat.
- I specifically said rare.

188
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,959
I told them twice.
I said, "Not overdone".

189
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,838
We're not here to enjoy ourselves.

190
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:57,636
- Eat it anyway. Eat something else.
- No.

191
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:02,430
- The macaroni and cheese is good.
- Would you like my piece? It's rare.

192
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:05,557
Well, that's very nice of you.
Are you sure?

193
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,596
- Sure.
- OK.

194
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,513
See, I can't eat steak
that's not rare.

195
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,636
Oh, doesn't that look nice?

196
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,472
It started out as a hobby,

197
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:18,711
but I get so many requests
I can't turn 'em out quick enough.

198
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,756
They're all genuine ceramic,

199
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:23,638
and we got this rubber bulb here.

200
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:27,429
You squeeze this, wash it with
some washable red vegetable dye,

201
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:31,069
give it a squeeze, you can
make his wounds bleed. Watch.

202
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,390
Isn't that somethin'?

203
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,835
- Do you like the country?
- Yes, very much.

204
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,878
I was brought up
in a Catholic school,

205
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:41,428
so I have moments of nostalgia.

206
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:44,478
Well, sure. Let your soul wander,

207
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,596
and if the miracles of nature

208
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:50,309
should lead to intimations
of something larger...

209
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,630
Just try and have an open heart.

210
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,269
OK. There wouldn't be any ticks
around here, would there?

211
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:59,750
- I'd hate to get Lyme disease.
- We've had no casualties so far.

212
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,070
- Oh, good.
- Would you excuse me?

213
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,116
Yes. Bye.

214
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,833
What do you mean, a divorce?

215
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,231
- Divorce... Try and understand.
- Why?

216
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,754
It's not you, it's me, I have to...

217
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:25,195
- Pull the car over.
- Robin, we should...

218
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,793
Pull the fucking car over!

219
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,235
Jesus! Will you just calm down?

220
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,190
Robin, wait! Robin!

221
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:37,909
Robin, where are you going?
That's not safe! Robin!

222
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,839
Robin, come on, are you crazy? This
is dangerous. We can't talk here.

223
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:47,480
You met someone else?

224
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:50,393
- I knew you'd think that.
- You have. You're lying.

225
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,277
I haven't.

226
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:56,717
Then why? After 16 fine years?
Why now a divorce?

227
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:02,954
It's me. I'm confused. I wanna go
in a different direction.

228
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,032
- If you're confused, see a doctor.
- I've done that!

229
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:11,319
Oh, that's news! What other surprises
have you got in store for me?

230
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,994
This was not an easy decision.

231
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:17,959
You've met someone!
Nobody just ups and goes.

232
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:21,589
You know, we got married so young,
there was no time for living!

233
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,069
- Change for what?
- All we know is each other!

234
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,958
So who else do you wanna explore?
Allison?

235
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,598
Why Allison?

236
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:31,752
Your hands were touching
in the station wagon.

237
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,638
- I don't believe this!
- You didn't pull yours away!

238
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,076
- You're having an affair!
- Not an affair! I just...

239
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,311
- Well, you slept with her.
- That's why I want a divorce.

240
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:45,313
- To marry Allison?
- No! Because I can't be dishonest

241
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:48,597
and I have been, I don't wanna do it.

242
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,194
- Who else?
- Nobody else!

243
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,510
OK. Lee, tell me.

244
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:01,953
Now that we're clearing the air,
I won't get angry.

245
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,996
Lee, come on.

246
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:07,274
Let's just...
Let's just clear the air.

247
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,396
I won't get angry.

248
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,553
- Aren't you cold?
- We're clearing the air.

249
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,676
I'm not gonna get angry.

250
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,079
Sheila...

251
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,311
Sheila? Sheila?!

252
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:28,039
Oh, you lowlife motherfucker!

253
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,634
- That's my best friend!
- I can't talk to you!

254
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,951
It's not about women, it's about
my life that I'm depressed.

255
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:37,589
- Your life with me.
- I hate my work, the travel pieces.

256
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:41,559
I tried to bring this up with you
but you're so high strung.

257
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:45,713
We can't talk! It's over,
you know? I'm not happy!

258
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,870
I'm not happy!

259
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:50,633
Robin? Robin, are you OK?

260
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,995
Robin. Robin, are you OK?

261
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,275
No. But I will be.

262
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,753
Were you conscious
of wanting to shock people?

263
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:08,913
It's one of my best collections. I'm
really pleased the way it turned out.

264
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,355
I'm so glad you could make it.

265
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,072
- Let's talk next week.
- It was an inspired idea.

266
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,116
I had no idea that they use runways.

267
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,589
Hell of a job. Take care.
Nice seeing you.

268
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:25,194
I love the skyline,
it enhances my collection.

269
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:30,070
It's such a fantastic backdrop
for what you're trying to achieve.

270
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,674
It would be great
to talk more about this.

271
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:36,116
Come next week, we'll have lunch
and I'll show you my operation.

272
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:40,079
- Do you mind if we talk now?
- Sure, no problem. OK.

273
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:11,793
Hey. Nice car.

274
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:17,199
Thank... I... Would you wanna drive
it? Because it's a terrific...

275
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,113
- It's yours?
- What am I, a car thief?

276
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:25,194
It's an Aston Martin.
You're so welcome, because it's...

277
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,635
You're wearing a wig! Which is, er...

278
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,756
- Camouflage.
- Really?

279
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,796
- Give me the keys.
- Thank you.

280
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,836
You look much longer-haired.

281
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,876
You got enough room?

282
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,518
OK.

283
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:43,352
Not too fast, because
the steering's a little, er...

284
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:49,353
- It's like flying a plane.
- It's a 1967 Aston Martin.

285
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,319
It cost a small fortune, then I had
them put the wheel on the left.

286
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,756
Do you wanna go for a drink?

287
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:00,515
Oh! I promised a friend
that I would go to his opening.

288
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,478
Wait, do you know
the painter Bruce Bishop?

289
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,516
- I've seen his work.
- He's a genius!

290
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,591
- Really?
- We'll go to the party...

291
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:10,399
- Yeah?
- Then we'll have a drink afterwards.

292
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,550
- Really? Great!
- OK.

293
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,993
Great.

294
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:18,595
Oscar gets this commission to do
this clocktower in the shopping mall,

295
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,432
and what does he propose?

296
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:23,193
An eight-storey penis!
I'm not kidding.

297
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,840
These are gorgeous. Congratulations.

298
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:29,356
- An eight-storey penis?
- This little town in Kansas...

299
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:33,718
Farmers driving their families
to church past this giant erection.

300
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,950
Oh, look. Darling!

301
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:39,349
- How are you?
- Thank you so much for coming.

302
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,874
- It's a pleasure.
- I'm in trouble.

303
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:45,236
Congratulations.
Lee Simons. This is amazing.

304
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:49,279
They don't get it. The more
I think about it, the worse it is.

305
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,510
Either you get my work or you don't,

306
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,319
but don't buy my fucking paintings
to be "in".

307
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,753
Yes!

308
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:59,310
Buy them only if you have to have
a Bruce Bishop. It's all image.

309
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:02,278
- It's... 100 per cent.
- Bruce, calm down.

310
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:05,193
- No, but he's right.
- Bruce, calm down.

311
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,636
- We should go, because...
- Are you a Libran?

312
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,872
- I'm a Sagittarius.
- That's why you're so impatient.

313
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:17,078
I'm so attracted to Sagittarians,
but they're so impatient.

314
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,515
Excuse me, would you sign this?

315
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,433
- I use your exercise tape.
- You do?

316
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:25,432
- So do I.
- But I exercise to it.

317
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:29,559
- I can see that, you look lovely.
- We should probably just, you know.

318
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:33,155
- We should get away and have some...
- You really wanna do that?

319
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,196
...quiet time.

320
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,833
- How are you?
- You look gorgeous!

321
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:41,639
- But these people are just insane.
- Completely.

322
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,676
So who did you see?

323
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,513
I'm gonna get my drink.
I'll be right back.

324
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:03,036
You're so quiet.

325
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,271
I... I was just thinking.

326
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:13,270
You are the most beautiful creature
I've ever seen.

327
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:17,114
I mean, every curve in your body
fulfils its promise.

328
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:23,150
If the universe has any meaning
at all, I'm looking at it.

329
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:28,353
- You're so sweet.
- You're perfect.

330
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,795
Do you have any flaws?

331
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,189
I'm agog with...

332
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:38,114
- Physically?
- Any way. To me, you're a miracle.

333
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:43,069
I don't usually drool in my date's
salad, I'm not usually like this.

334
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,913
Well, I'm polymorphously perverse.

335
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:50,995
It's not a flaw.
It's just a weakness.

336
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:53,958
Polymorphously perverse meaning?

337
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:59,592
Meaning every part of my body is...
well, gives me sexual pleasure.

338
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,557
Meaning?

339
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,235
Meaning every part of me
gives me erotic pleasure.

340
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:14,273
And how sensitive does that make you?

341
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:22,238
Well, if you touch my thighs,
my hands, my neck, my kneecaps, I...

342
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,431
I'm orgasmic.

343
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,954
Where did you learn this?

344
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,476
It's Dionysian.

345
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:35,075
A Greek taught it to me.
Now I can't get rid of it.

346
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:40,115
It's not a flaw, just a weakness.

347
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:44,637
So, you know, if I...
See if I can get this right.

348
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:50,078
If I touch your hand, I take it,
I just stroke it, I would...

349
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:54,072
Stroke it like this and you, er...

350
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:58,240
Oh, my God.
OK, we should get outta here.

351
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,915
I'll get the check, I'll just get
the coat and we can take your, uh...

352
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,956
Come on, we're gonna go dancing.

353
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:06,190
- Dancing? That's great!
- I can't dance.

354
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,236
- We'll dance!
- I can't.

355
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:12,632
- Everybody can dance! Let's dance.
- Yeah, I'll get the check.

356
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:17,032
Oh, God, I know I've made a lot of
blasphemous remarks and atheist jokes

357
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,680
but that was just her hand!

358
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,075
- Shit!
- What is it? What is it?

359
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:43,276
I need echinacea right away.

360
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,112
What is echinacea?

361
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,668
You take it at
the first sign of a cold.

362
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,513
Well, why don't we go and find some?
Let's leave!

363
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,955
It's too late
for a health store to be open.

364
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:55,998
- I know an all-night drugstore.
- They won't have it.

365
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:59,311
I have none at home.
I have to go to Milan tomorrow.

366
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,868
Yes! Echi...

367
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,837
Ecchymosis?

368
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:06,832
No, I told you, it's an herb.

369
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:09,434
Yeah. That's because
I can't hear you!

370
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,272
It's an herb!

371
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:45,720
So I couldn't find any echinacea.

372
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,836
You need some echinacea?

373
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:50,388
- You have some?
- I always carry some.

374
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,152
He's got some.

375
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:57,757
- So, where to?
- It's OK, we should get home.

376
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,559
- You gotta fly to Milan tomorrow.
- No, it's OK.

377
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,108
Don't wanna eat?
Stuff a cold, starve a fever?

378
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:07,398
Really, that's OK. Incidentally,
I think you're a tremendous athlete,

379
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,710
you must have
the most enormous future.

380
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:12,633
- This your car?
- Yes, it's an Aston Martin.

381
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:16,793
It's a very old car, they cost
a fortune. I used to have a Volvo.

382
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,838
I'll give you a call
when we come back to play the Knicks.

383
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,911
Let me give you my number.

384
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:26,153
You know, you are amazing.

385
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:30,711
I notice that men just stare at you.
Women stare at you.

386
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,552
It's incredible.

387
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,631
- I used to live with a woman.
- Really?

388
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,951
Yeah. A beautiful,
young German model.

389
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:42,516
The looks we used to get
when we were dancing together.

390
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,955
But you prefer men?

391
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,356
Usually.

392
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,391
Well, that's... That's great.

393
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:07,190
You're not afraid of catching germs?
I'm coming down with a cold.

394
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:10,590
From you, I'd be willing
to catch terminal cancer.

395
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:15,389
- My place or yours?
- Whichever would make you happier.

396
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:21,915
My place. I have a mirror
on my wall by my bed.

397
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,878
You have a mirror. Sure.

398
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:32,712
Oh, my God! I am so sorry!

399
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:37,191
- You're OK? You're not bleeding?
- No. I'm just a little shaken!

400
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:40,794
Christ! What were you thinking?

401
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:44,429
You know, God, I hope the police
don't give me a balloon test.

402
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:48,718
I can't be in the papers connected
with some drunk-driving accident!

403
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:52,236
- I'm not drunk! My eyes were...
- The tabloids will kill me!

404
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,754
I just signed a huge
personal endorsement

405
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:59,038
- with a big cosmetic company!
- I'm sorry, but my eye was...

406
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,554
I gotta go. I'm gonna get a cab.

407
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:05,155
- I'll take you home, because we...
- Are you crazy?

408
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:07,196
Look at your Aston Martin!

409
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:10,397
I can claim it in the morning.
I wanted to see your mirror.

410
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,711
Lee, you can't leave
the scene of an accident.

411
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:16,553
This is a bad neighbourhood.
You should really...

412
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:19,313
I'll be fine! I'm a black belt.

413
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:22,790
What if you're...
What if you're bleeding internally?

414
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,950
It was nice to meet you.

415
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,072
Fuckin' cold!

416
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,912
Rain!

417
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,430
Excuse me, I've been waiting
over two hours.

418
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:41,796
- Dr Lupus does know you're here.
- I can't wait any longer.

419
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:44,952
- If you prefer to reschedule...
- No, no, no, no.

420
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:48,350
- I've had my appointment since June.
- I've been waiting a year.

421
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:52,399
I know a woman who sold
her appointment for $3,000.

422
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,038
Oh, my God.

423
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:56,873
If I'm gonna have anyone touch me,
I want the best.

424
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,633
Ever since that Newsweek article,
we're overrun.

425
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:02,109
- Nurse, please.
- Dr Lupus...

426
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,760
Oh, very interesting.
I could work with that.

427
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:07,149
- Miss Lipton in seven.
- Yeah.

428
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:10,198
It really is worth the wait.
The man is an artist.

429
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:14,319
Dr Lupus, hello. I'm a little
concerned about my jowls.

430
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,868
- They'll go. Some of this neck, too.
- The neck?

431
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,916
Excuse me, please.

432
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:22,920
No, no. Those eyes have to be wider,

433
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,594
and we got to get rid
of that double chin.

434
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:29,150
My dream would be to look like
Pearl Chavez, the fiery half-breed.

435
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:32,550
Duel In The Sun? We'll make them
think you have Indian blood.

436
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,595
Thank you.

437
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:39,549
- I don't know what I'm doing here.
- It was terrific of you to see us.

438
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:43,428
- You're one of my special people.
- Do I need a makeover?

439
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:46,990
- Why be less than perfect?
- These eyes. Can we do anything?

440
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:51,119
- I see what you mean, they're beady.
- Beady? I don't know.

441
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:54,829
- I told her you're a genius.
- I read the Newsweek article.

442
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:57,195
- What about your lips? Fuller?
- Fuller?

443
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:59,635
Unless you prefer
that cold, stressful look.

444
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:02,280
- Are they too thin?
- We won't make it noticeable.

445
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:04,476
Well, noticeable but not artificial.

446
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:07,279
- Doctor, the cameras are here.
- Thank you, nurse.

447
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,396
Network's doing a feature on me.

448
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,630
We're in the plush Park Avenue office

449
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:14,473
of the man called
the Michelangelo of Manhattan.

450
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,312
Ignore the camera, Doc.

451
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,550
What about your breasts and buttocks?

452
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:22,599
With the skill of a great sculptor,
unsightly flesh is suctioned away,

453
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:27,196
until all that remains is youth -
or the illusion of youth.

454
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:29,748
- I'm outta here.
- No, please.

455
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,910
Outside, in the waiting room,

456
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,834
anxious faces wait their turn
for a transmogrification...

457
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:39,549
I'm sorry. The doctor
doesn't do penis enlargements.

458
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:43,189
- We don't have the space.
- We're talking about three inches.

459
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:45,236
Renowned socialite Pinky Virdon

460
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:47,595
uses the VIP entrance
reserved for the few

461
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:51,195
who do not have to plan aeons
in advance for an appointment.

462
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:53,475
I'm not blaming you,
but I have to go.

463
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:57,599
OK, I'll go and get your coat,
we'll go out the side exit.

464
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:01,070
- The side exit? OK.
- I'll be right back.

465
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:03,390
The waiting room's round the corner,

466
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:07,678
so get some comments from the women
and the nurses, too.

467
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:11,673
Excuse me, I'm sorry for disturbing
you, I've got a whole crew here.

468
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:14,399
- Dr Lupus said...
- Yeah, I was just leaving.

469
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:17,711
He did a terrific job on you,
you look great.

470
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:20,473
Well... Are my lips too thin?

471
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:23,950
Not for me. Whatever
he charged you, it was worth it.

472
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:26,190
Thanks for the vote of confidence.

473
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:30,353
I'm Tony Gardella. I'm producing
the feature for News At Noon.

474
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:32,635
- And you are?
- Robin Simon.

475
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,792
- And what do you do?
- I'm a schoolteacher.

476
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:39,839
Schoolteacher? Great, so you saved
your money, invested it here,

477
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:42,434
and now you're a knockout.

478
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:44,556
No, I've only come
for a consultation.

479
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,995
- He hasn't done anything to me.
- Really?

480
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:49,958
Well, for whatever it's worth,
from a stranger,

481
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:52,190
I wouldn't change a freckle.

482
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:54,589
Well, thank you.

483
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:59,390
I have always depended on
the kindness of strangers.

484
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:08,716
- So...
- Well. I'd better get to, um...

485
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:11,598
- doin' this thing, huh?
- Yeah. Back to work.

486
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,636
- Yeah, bye.
- Bye.

487
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:21,559
Listen, forgive me, but, um,
are you married, or anything?

488
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,949
If not, what are you doing later?

489
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:26,156
- Later when?
- Six o'clock.

490
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,549
- Why?
- Wanna go to a screening?

491
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,473
- A screening?
- There's a new John Papadakis film.

492
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:35,155
I have to go. I thought maybe
you'd like to go along.

493
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,673
I...

494
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,637
No.

495
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:42,154
Thank you very much, but I can't.

496
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,550
See, I don't go
to the films very often

497
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,598
and I actually haven't
heard of that director.

498
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:52,478
- Well...
- Thanks so much for thinking of me.

499
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:55,597
- She'll be very happy to go.
- This is my, um...

500
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:58,831
Accepting for Ms Simon,
her friend, Cheryl.

501
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:02,188
So, tell me, are you friendly
with your ex-husband?

502
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:07,308
We would be now, if we met. That's
the mark of the age of psychotherapy.

503
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:10,278
Everybody's so
sophisticated and mature.

504
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,316
Hi, how are you?

505
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:15,153
At least you're not still angry.

506
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:17,390
No, no, no. That phase is over.

507
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:22,712
There comes a time when you have
to stop tantruming and move on.

508
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:25,633
Champagne tastes like
it was made yesterday.

509
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:30,555
You think so? I kinda liked it.
I'm feeling a little light-headed.

510
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,712
I wish I was light-headed.
I hate theses screenings.

511
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:37,156
- Do you?
- I'd rather be in a real audience.

512
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:42,075
I feel I should know who all these
people are, but I'm so out of touch.

513
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:46,597
All right. See that guy? That's
Papadakis, the director of the film.

514
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,989
- Oh, yes?
- He's very arty, pretentious.

515
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:52,868
One of those assholes who shoots
all his films in black and white.

516
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,712
Tom Dale. Big star.

517
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:58,156
He's in New York filming an
adaptation of a sequel of a remake.

518
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:01,710
Oh, and getting out of the elevator,
I see there's a famous critic.

519
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:04,360
- Him I recognise.
- He used to hate every movie.

520
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:07,989
Then he married a young, big-bosomed
woman, now he loves every movie.

521
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:10,640
God, I am so out of touch.

522
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:12,790
Can I get you a refill?

523
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:16,270
Oh, yes. What the hell? Why not?

524
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:21,114
If I could think of what to do,
I would never think of teaching.

525
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:23,316
- Work for me.
- As what?

526
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,356
All I'm good at is Chaucer.

527
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:30,468
Well, we have a cooking show.
You could do Great Writer's Recipes.

528
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:35,634
Chaucer's Fettucini With Clam Sauce,
Sir Walter Raleigh's Gazpacho.

529
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:37,711
No, that's OK.

530
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:41,110
But I'm glad you asked me out,
I'm having a very nice...

531
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:44,156
- What's the matter?
- Lee.

532
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:46,356
- Who's Lee?
- My husband.

533
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:49,113
- Your husband?
- God, I don't wanna see him here.

534
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:52,112
- You said it was no problem.
- Stand there.

535
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:55,112
- All right, all right.
- No, no, no!

536
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:58,033
- What?
- Talk to me, act natural.

537
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:01,078
- Would you like...
- More to the left!

538
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:03,151
Oh, God! He's gonna see me.

539
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:05,708
Where are you going? Robin?

540
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:08,189
- Is he there?
- I don't know who he is.

541
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:10,840
- Is he going in?
- There's a blond guy.

542
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:15,391
Is that who I think it is? Robin?
Robin! What are you doing here?

543
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:19,189
- Robin!
- I'm looking for my earring.

544
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,236
I dropped my earring.

545
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:25,711
Bonnie, this is Robin,
Robin, this is Bonnie. How are you?

546
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:28,519
- How am I?
- How are you?

547
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:31,717
You mean now?
You mean my physical health?

548
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:36,548
- Well, whatever.
- Well, I'm a little thirsty, but...

549
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,596
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

550
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:42,275
- I just have to... Oh, dear.
- I guess we won't have a drink.

551
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,749
- We'll go in.
- We'll see you in there.

552
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:47,832
We'll catch you inside.
Nice to see you.

553
00:35:56,440 --> 00:36:00,035
- Are you going to be all right?
- I should never drink.

554
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:06,510
His use of all these flashbacks
and slow motion is a bit pretentious.

555
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:09,319
Can you believe
that harlot he's with?

556
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:12,517
- Do you think she's pretty?
- Well, I, you know.

557
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:15,717
She's probably one of
those porn channel outcalls,

558
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:18,519
you dial a number
if you need an escort.

559
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:21,319
Escort, I mean, really!

560
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:24,472
"Deep massage," they say,
but that's bullshit.

561
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,869
Probably dial 588-PUSSY!

562
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:29,349
I think she's an editor
for Random House.

563
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:34,150
How could you have slept with Sheila,
my best friend? You found her bovine!

564
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:37,629
His word - bovine.

565
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:42,191
Am I lying? Did you not say
Sheila was a vâche hollandaise?

566
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,157
Well, didn't you?

567
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,231
Am I lying?

568
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:51,319
You know you're a sick woman? You're
a sick woman, that's what you are!

569
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,277
Yeah, OK. OK.

570
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,552
- I'm sorry.
- It's OK.

571
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:11,596
I lost control.

572
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,636
I guess you're still
in love with him.

573
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:15,995
Guess I am. Good night.

574
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:20,548
- Think about what I said.
- About what?

575
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:24,076
- About coming to work for me.
- Oh, that's a fantasy.

576
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,594
Hey, you're bright, you could learn.

577
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:31,071
My company's getting into a lot of
new areas. You could grow with us.

578
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:34,476
Too inhibited.

579
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,630
- It's a shame.
- I'm sorry.

580
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:39,472
Bye.

581
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:52,868
- Did you like the movie?
- I hate this director, Papadakis.

582
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,996
It's one cliché after another.

583
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:59,596
When you see the scripts that get
made, I just find it so depressing.

584
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:03,831
Were you upset over
that run-in with your ex?

585
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:06,639
She's an hysteric.
I'm so lucky that I got out.

586
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:09,598
Tonight was proof positive,
if I needed proof.

587
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:12,240
It sounds like
you're protesting too much.

588
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,880
My class reunion
was the defining moment for me.

589
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,315
- How's that?
- I went to a class reunion.

590
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,550
Take my advice - don't ever do it.

591
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:22,757
- Doris! How are you?
- You look great!

592
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:25,912
- This is Nat.
- Hi, Nat. So, what are you up to?

593
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,152
- I work for an importer. And you?
- I write for a travel magazine.

594
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:33,357
- You must get a lot of free travel.
- Tell me about it.

595
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,590
Our 727 crash landing in Dubrovnik!

596
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,558
- Eddie!
- Look what the cat dragged in!

597
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:41,598
- This is Lenore, my wife.
- Pleased to meet you.

598
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:45,559
- What are you up to?
- We got four kids, two on the way.

599
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:47,995
What do you do when
you're not procreating?

600
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,638
I forget.

601
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:53,110
I'm a dentist. That's it.
Have you seen Jay Tepper over there?

602
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:56,158
- I don't believe this.
- Lee, how are you?

603
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:59,198
- What are you doing these days?
- I'm hangin' in there.

604
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,714
Still running track
and killing the girls?

605
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,756
I'm long married.

606
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,990
This is Marion, speaking of married.

607
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:08,594
- Where is your wife?
- She has shingles.

608
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,511
Psychological.

609
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:13,797
- You're not a shrink?
- No, I'm not. I'm a psychoanalyst.

610
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:16,189
Psychoanalyst? Can you believe that?

611
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:18,236
- Give me a call.
- Give you a call?

612
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:22,154
Monroe Gordon
and his lovely wife, Dana.

613
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,629
Monroe, whom you remember
as Nathan Detroit

614
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,676
in our production of Guys And Dolls,

615
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:29,718
and who has gone on to a highly
successful singing career.

616
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:30,949
Broadway,

617
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:35,989
Atlantic City, Carlton's Restaurant
off the Sunrise Highway...

618
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,511
and the Sunrise Lounge.

619
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:43,558
Monroe's going to sing a song
that was made very popular

620
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:45,392
during our high school years.

621
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:16,760
What happened to all my classmates?

622
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:20,037
Everyone's so mature-looking
and overweight.

623
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:22,076
I didn't age that much.

624
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:24,435
Unless I did and I can't see it.

625
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:28,915
All these dentists and veterinarians
and antique dealers.

626
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,754
Capped teeth and bald heads,
grey hairs coming in.

627
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,796
Sam Jablon has that rug on.

628
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:39,032
It looks like it fell on his head
from a window and nobody told him.

629
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:41,680
Some dead already. Annette DeAngelo,

630
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:44,832
breasts I once caressed
lying cold in the ground.

631
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:48,639
God, how I wanted to sleep
with Polly Weiss.

632
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,870
Now she's turned into her mother.

633
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:55,033
And Freddie Kaplan's my age! He could
be my father's pinochle partner.

634
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:57,395
I'm fucking Prufrock!

635
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:00,313
I gotta change my life
before it's too late.

636
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:03,356
Pardon me?

637
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,396
I'm not happy, Jay.

638
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:08,313
I married too young.

639
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:12,029
Neither of us had the chance
to live, to explore.

640
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:14,998
Lee, these aren't exactly
my office hours.

641
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:18,231
I'm talking to you, Jay,
while there's still time.

642
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:21,630
I just turned 40,
I don't wanna look up at 50

643
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:26,077
and find I measured out my fuckin'
life with a coffee spoon.

644
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,116
Try and relax.

645
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:31,474
And, er... put the vodka down.

646
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:36,475
I mean, Robin's lovely, you know,
she's a little neurotic, but...

647
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:39,916
I don't wanna spend my life
the husband of a schoolteacher

648
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:44,596
writing the occasional
travel piece and...

649
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:47,274
and never knowing what it's like

650
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:50,636
to make love to that amazing,
sleazy blonde

651
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:53,075
that's married to Monroe Gordon.

652
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:55,712
And the truth is

653
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:58,553
that Robin is dull in bed.

654
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:00,995
Fucking Catholic inhibitions.

655
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:03,719
Maybe I don't excite her enough
any more.

656
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:07,713
You see, I don't know
what the truth is any more.

657
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:10,712
- I don't know.
- Listen to me. Are you in treatment?

658
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:14,679
One minute you're in the lunchroom
at Glenwood High.

659
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:19,436
You blink and you're 40, blink again
and you can see movies at half price

660
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,556
on a senior citizen's pass.

661
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:24,875
Ask not for whom the bell tolls.

662
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:27,872
Or, to put it more accurately,

663
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:30,713
ask not for whom the toilet flushes.

664
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:46,548
Where were you
while we were making love?

665
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:50,076
You know, in high school
I was Class Writer.

666
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:52,116
That's why I keep telling you.

667
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:55,158
Forget that screenplay
and get back to your novel.

668
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:58,949
- Too inhibited.
- You'll never get over bad reviews?

669
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:01,998
My two novels were dismissed,
it was brutal.

670
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:06,631
Maybe after I sell a screenplay.
Film is where it's at.

671
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:10,429
Who reads book any more, anyhow?
Kids are into cinema.

672
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:14,752
- I don't believe that, nor do you.
- Why are you getting dressed?

673
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:17,070
Going home. Isn't that what you want?

674
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:20,197
No... I don't know what I want.

675
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:24,796
You're the only one who makes
any sense to me since my divorce.

676
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:28,236
I'm not looking for someone
to make sense to.

677
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:30,880
I want somebody
to become irrational over me.

678
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:34,111
Maybe after I sell
my armoured car robbery script

679
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:37,272
I'll get back to
something more serious.

680
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:40,318
Philip's having some people
for dinner next week.

681
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,755
- I'd love you to come.
- Philip Datloff?

682
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:44,671
Yeah, he's sweet.

683
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:50,232
An editor of his stature? He'd make
me feel guilty that I wasn't writing.

684
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:52,390
I want you two to meet.

685
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:54,710
I won't know what to say.

686
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,836
So what's your novel about?

687
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:58,876
I don't have a novel.

688
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:04,318
He does. He has pages he's worked on
for over a year. He's terrific.

689
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:08,313
Bonnie is a very gifted editor.
I'm grooming her for my job.

690
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:11,756
I didn't have the emotional energy
required to finish it.

691
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:14,559
How many people read it?
A film reaches millions.

692
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:18,679
It is not energy. It's confidence.
Apparently his first two books...

693
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:23,117
The three S's - self-indulgent,
sophomoric, solipsistic.

694
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:26,317
If every writer who suffered
bad press caved in...

695
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:30,075
- You're too thin-skinned.
- God, that's VJ Rajnipal.

696
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:32,116
- Excuse me.
- Philip's his editor.

697
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:36,671
What am I doing here? He won the
Nobel Prize, and totally deserved!

698
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:40,594
I'm out of my league!
I'm awash in self-contempt.

699
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:44,150
You know that Irwin Shaw wrote
the best anti-war play ever?

700
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:46,196
And he got it all into one act.

701
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:48,032
He was an idol of mine.

702
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:51,351
When I was in high school
I read The Eighty Yard Run,

703
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:54,193
and I wept, I just cried in class.

704
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:58,478
That story made me want to write.
That and some pieces by Saroyan.

705
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:02,917
- Saroyan? You love him too?
- I love the plays, the essays.

706
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,959
When I think of Irwin Shaw, I think
of The Girls In Their Summer Dresses.

707
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:09,998
That title is better than
most people's short stories.

708
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:13,516
- It's so elegant, economic.
- The best.

709
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:15,716
It's thrilling prose. It's terrific.

710
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:19,553
My book is about the values
of a society gone astray.

711
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:21,596
A culture badly in need of help.

712
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:24,638
A country that gives a kid who can
barely read or write

713
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:27,473
a $100 million contract
to play basketball?

714
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:31,792
A murder trial or who's sleeping
with the president is show business?

715
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:33,836
Everything is show business!

716
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:37,469
I'm getting shrill. I get so nervous
when I talk about my novel.

717
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:39,312
You have to finish it.

718
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:43,154
Screenplays have their place, but
there's nothing like a serious book.

719
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:44,992
Exactly my point.

720
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:48,993
In Red Letter Day, I touched on
these themes but I was too green.

721
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:52,789
I remember Red Letter Day.
I reviewed it for The Times.

722
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:56,236
- Oh?
- It was extremely...

723
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:59,709
half-baked, laboured.

724
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:01,552
Solipsistic.

725
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:04,029
There was no energy. It was trivial.

726
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:06,395
You don't mind my being frank?

727
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:10,236
Are you OK?

728
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:14,750
The rest of them
should be here pretty soon.

729
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:17,752
Let's not take all day,
I've got plans later.

730
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:19,592
This way, Mr Adelman.

731
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:22,478
- Counsellor! Nice to have you back.
- It's a pleasure.

732
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:25,791
- Put him in the Green Room.
- You're from the ACLU, right?

733
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:29,111
- Can I get you anything?
- I'm expecting Roger Lewis to call.

734
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:31,156
- Can I have it put through?
- Of course.

735
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:33,800
These gentlemen are from
the South Carolina Klan.

736
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:36,269
I'll make sure your call
gets put through.

737
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:40,114
Minister Polynice! The Attorney and
the Klansmen are in the Green Room.

738
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:42,668
Is there time for a sandwich
before we go on?

739
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:45,035
Robin, can I see you in my office?

740
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:47,634
Mary... Margaret, I'm so sorry.

741
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:50,598
Attorney Adelman
is expecting a call from the ACLU...

742
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:52,875
- Hi, I'm Dawn Dawson.
- Dawn Dawson?

743
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:55,599
The teenage obese acrobat.
I had an appointment.

744
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:58,911
Robin! Why is the teenage
obese acrobat here today?

745
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,753
- You said the 14th.
- Overweight Achievers?

746
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:04,479
- I gave out the wrong date!
- You said the 14th.

747
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:07,870
I am so sorry.
Excuse me, the skinheads are here.

748
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:09,996
I don't know where to put them.

749
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:13,390
What about the lounge?
We'll put them with Rabbi Kaufman.

750
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:17,359
- It's just down the corner...
- Hey! Where's my makeup man?

751
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:20,398
I'm a lawyer. You expect me
to go on without makeup?

752
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:26,715
It's a madhouse. I gave
the overweight guests the wrong date.

753
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:28,950
- Come here.
- I'm so sorry.

754
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:33,795
- I really screwed up, I'm so sorry.
- I've been watching you all morning.

755
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:36,348
- And I can't take my eyes off you.
- Oh, no.

756
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:40,558
I mean it, I can't get this past
weekend in Bermuda out of my mind.

757
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:44,030
- There's a lot going on out there.
- Priorities. Never...

758
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:47,873
...confuse priorities.
- Oh, my God!

759
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:52,834
Hello. I'm Professor Benz.
We're here for the taping.

760
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:56,469
I'm so sorry, I really
have to apologise for her.

761
00:47:56,560 --> 00:48:00,553
Overweight Achievers
is next week. Sorry. OK?

762
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:02,596
- Who are you?
- Lou DeMarco.

763
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:04,159
- Who?
- Who?

764
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:08,233
I'm the uncle of Tony Lipriano
from the Genovese family, that's who.

765
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:11,232
Mr DeMarco, our Cosa Nostra show
is next week.

766
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:14,232
- She told me today!
- I know, I'm sorry.

767
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:17,437
I can't be here next week.
I'm being deported Thursday.

768
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:24,075
- Didn't we do Sally's show together?
- We're going back a long time.

769
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:27,709
- I only had two murders then.
- You're with William Morris?

770
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:30,951
Where are the bagels?
The skinheads eat the bagels already?

771
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:36,710
Robin, would you like to interview
this professional woman

772
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:39,268
for that panel on lovemaking
next Tuesday?

773
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:41,510
Right, what's the show called?

774
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:44,592
Working Girls Born And Raised
In Manhattan. I'm Nina.

775
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:47,353
- Nina. Right. OK, great.
- OK.

776
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:50,796
Bye. So, you're actually a hooker?

777
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:52,836
Yeah, that's right.

778
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:57,673
Tony, you finally got here.
Traffic that bad?

779
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:00,832
I told you it would be heavy traffic.
I knew it.

780
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:04,435
Hey, Grandma, look who's here!
Your favourite grandson.

781
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:06,875
- Hi, Tony. Hi, Tony.
- Hi, Grandma.

782
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:12,676
This is Robin, everybody.

783
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:16,670
- How are you?
- My sister, Iris.

784
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:18,955
- Hello.
- Nice to meet you.

785
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:22,112
Tony's a doll.
You know he got us this house?

786
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:24,475
- Show her the house.
- Mom, stop it.

787
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:27,120
So, the problem is,
there's a waiting list

788
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:29,316
to get Grandpa into the nursing home.

789
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:32,517
It's the only home I trust,
all the others are toilets.

790
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:36,559
But this one, he'd be taken care of,
but there's a waiting list.

791
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:41,156
So maybe if you called, we would
tell 'em it's for you, for Grandpa.

792
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:45,631
You know, use your name. Then maybe
they'll move him up on the list.

793
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:48,678
- We could try, Pop.
- I'd appreciate it. He needs it.

794
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:51,354
Tony, Tony...
Talk to him about this table.

795
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:52,998
Grandma!

796
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:56,197
I wanna take Iris to Le Bijou
for her birthday dinner.

797
00:49:56,280 --> 00:50:00,193
It's impossible to get into, and no
decent table that's not out the back.

798
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:03,192
Excuse me, there is
a six-month waiting list.

799
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:06,431
- I'll have Mary make a call.
- As long as it's convenient.

800
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:09,114
- Is that all you think about, food?
- Try that.

801
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:11,760
When are you gonna get
my season ticket upgraded?

802
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:13,910
What am I, Don Corleone?

803
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,468
Not for me, brother,
it's for your nephew.

804
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:18,630
Ricky, come here.

805
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:22,030
I want you to tell Grandma
who came and spoke at your school.

806
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:24,918
- You had a guest speaker?
- Yeah, John Brennan.

807
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,956
- Nice!
- The hostage guy?

808
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:30,112
- You don't know John Brennan?
- The hostage, you remember.

809
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:33,351
- Never heard of him.
- They hijacked his plane.

810
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:35,715
They held him for months, right?

811
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:39,236
- Grandma's not gonna know this.
- Daddy, you remember?

812
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:42,949
- It was in all the papers.
- In the papers, on TV, everything.

813
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:46,749
They finally released him, he got
this hero's welcome. He's famous!

814
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:49,991
What's he famous for?
For being captured?

815
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:52,036
- Yeah!
- Why is he a hero?

816
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:54,111
It's no feat to get captured!

817
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:57,270
Your family's crazy about you.

818
00:50:57,360 --> 00:50:59,590
Well, they've never
had much of anything

819
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:02,956
and my success has made
so many things possible.

820
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:05,554
Guess that's why I'm so driven
professionally.

821
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:06,789
Lovely.

822
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:10,429
It's fun to be able to do things
for people you love.

823
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:13,910
Did you ever think that you might
want a family of your own?

824
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,390
Oh, yeah, I would.
I'm surprised you don't have one.

825
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:22,952
Well, you know. At the beginning
we were young, not much money.

826
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:27,955
Then, as time went on, Lee became a
little edgy whenever I brought it up.

827
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:32,636
Well, how big a family would you like
if we were ever to get married?

828
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:36,838
Oh, you know. I'm just waiting
for the other shoe to drop.

829
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:39,593
- What does that mean?
- Well, you know.

830
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:43,389
It means, um,
you can't be this perfect.

831
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:48,076
You didn't just walk into my life in
a doctor's office with no drawbacks.

832
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:51,072
Any minute I'm gonna discover
you have a wife.

833
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:54,994
Or you had one, but
you chopped her up with a hatchet.

834
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:05,192
Don't you fuckin'
walk away from me like that!

835
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:09,910
- Get away from me!
- It's all your fuckin' lying, bitch!

836
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:13,197
What the fuck?
Do you wanna ruin this?

837
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:15,999
You wanna fuckin' ruin
our relationship?

838
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:21,116
I'm sick of this bullshit!

839
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:23,156
Fuck you!

840
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:26,152
Tell her to get the fuck out
of our fuckin' lives!

841
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:28,595
I'm sick of it!
I'm tired of this bullshit!

842
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:31,240
- I can't take it any more!
- You're so paranoid!

843
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:35,279
I fuckin' love you! Tell her
to get the fuck out of our lives!

844
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:39,317
Baby, I love you. Don't fuckin'
do this to me, all right?

845
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:41,834
- Don't you fuckin' do this.
- Stop it.

846
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:47,793
Don't you fuckin' walk away. Don't
fuckin' walk away from me, you bitch!

847
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:51,476
There's a fight on the 11th floor.

848
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:52,913
- A fight?
- Where?

849
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,275
- 1102.
- That's Brandon Darrow.

850
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:58,113
- He does it every time.
- I called security.

851
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:00,236
Somebody's gotta get up there.

852
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:03,232
Come on! Hurry!
He's trying to hurt me!

853
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:06,036
Get in there!

854
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:09,794
- Excuse me, what's going on?
- Get outta here.

855
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:12,440
Whatever that bitch told you,
she's lying.

856
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:15,398
- I'm security.
- I'm gonna call my fuckin' lawyer!

857
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:18,912
Get the fuck outta here!

858
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,956
He tried to throw me out the window!

859
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:23,998
- Bitch! Don't you fuckin' lie!
- Take it easy.

860
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:26,036
- Keep him away!
- Take it easy.

861
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:28,509
Get your fucking hands off me.

862
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:30,670
Look. Easy, pal. Easy, pal.

863
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:32,876
I have an appointment with Mr Darrow.

864
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:35,315
Get your hand off my neck!
I hate this hotel!

865
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:38,278
- This bitch is lying!
- I'm Lee Simon, you read my script.

866
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:42,148
If your friend tries to plant coke
on me again, I'll kill you!

867
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:44,959
- I'm Lee Simon.
- What the fuck do you want, buddy?

868
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:48,999
He tried to throw me out the window
and throw my clothes out.

869
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:52,470
Don't bullshit strangers, bitch.
I'm not high, look at my eyes.

870
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:55,518
That's all right.
I never make moral judgments, so...

871
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:58,558
- What was your name?
- Nicole Oliver gave you my script.

872
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:01,598
It's about an armoured car robbery,
there's a strong subplot.

873
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:06,231
I'm gonna sue all you motherfuckers,
I'm gonna sue this fleabag hotel.

874
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:08,470
- What's going on?
- A little domestic.

875
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:11,154
It's time I get a little respect
around here!

876
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:12,992
- Shut up!
- Fuck you!

877
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:15,640
- Shut the hell up!
- A little domestic problem.

878
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:17,073
This guy?

879
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:19,116
He tried to throw me out the window.

880
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:21,111
That's physical enough for me.

881
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:23,589
Her friend tried to plant dope on me.

882
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:26,638
- Let's go downtown.
- You can talk to my people.

883
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:29,439
- Who are you?
- Lee Simon. We have a meeting.

884
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:31,750
Not right now. Later, maybe.

885
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:35,196
We had a meeting scheduled
and you know, it's important.

886
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:37,077
30 seconds would help.

887
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:40,116
Come on, ladies! Back it up!

888
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:44,751
We can have a brief conversation and
establish everything that we need.

889
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:47,559
Can we get these guys back, please?

890
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:49,596
- Get out of the way!
- Make room!

891
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:53,229
- Brandon, is tomorrow good for you?
- Clear the way!

892
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:54,992
Wait!

893
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:59,198
Wait! Wait! Don't take him away!

894
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:02,989
Call Irv Klein. Get him downtown,
all right? I'll be out an hour.

895
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:06,675
- John! Hold them back.
- Please! He didn't do anything!

896
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:10,594
I don't think you should hold him.
The hotel has no problem with this.

897
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:13,035
I brought a copy
in case you wanna talk.

898
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:15,076
- OK!
- He's welcome in the hotel.

899
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:19,358
Because this is Brandon Darrow,
that's the only reason. You hear?

900
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:22,273
- That's it.
- I thank you very much.

901
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:26,512
Mr Darrow, please come back
in the hotel. Stay outside, please.

902
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:31,037
You know, Brandon, if we could just
go into the bar and have a drink,

903
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:33,873
we could sit down and talk
for a few minutes.

904
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:37,953
There's some points I'm reworking
which you'd be very excited to hear.

905
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:42,431
I'm very open to this whole process.
Just in a brief conversation...

906
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:44,112
Brandon! We're gonna be late.

907
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:47,909
It's the first script I've read
with any balls.

908
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:51,117
- A combination of like...
- Is it five already?

909
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:55,159
I've always been interested, but it's
always "Can you get a bankable star?"

910
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:56,992
We need to talk about this.

911
00:55:57,080 --> 00:56:00,117
With you as Sonnyboy
and an unknown for the female lead.

912
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:02,760
You like fights?
We're going to Atlantic City

913
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:04,796
to see the Fernandez-Tobin fight.

914
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:07,394
- Atlantic City now?
- Yeah, it's five.

915
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:09,436
I have an assignment.

916
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:14,150
- If we could have a second now...
- I get a lot of scripts, all crap.

917
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:16,879
- Exactly.
- No fucking integrity.

918
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:20,509
I'm flattered, but I have
this assignment. Two minutes.

919
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:24,752
- I'm flying to Africa tomorrow.
- The magazine set this interview up.

920
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:27,593
It's with the mayor's wife -
she likes acting!

921
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:33,630
I got scratch marks all over my arm,
it's ridiculous.

922
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:36,871
- Are we taking off from Teterboro?
- Teterboro, yes.

923
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:38,996
- Taking off?
- Taking off.

924
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:41,548
- Oh, no...
- We can't drive now.

925
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:43,676
I should explain that I can't fly.

926
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:47,309
It sounds funny but I had a terrible
experience as a travel writer.

927
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:50,472
You're a fuckin' pussy.
The whole flight's 20 minutes.

928
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:53,313
- There was this crash landing.
- You like fights?

929
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:56,949
- Well, I like sports, sure.
- Do you like Fernandez or Tobin?

930
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:59,998
Tobin's got him, man!
Tobin's got him!

931
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:02,036
I like Fernandez.

932
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:04,429
- I'm really impressed with your ear.
- My ear?

933
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:07,990
- The dialogue.
- Oh, my ear. Well, I try. I listen.

934
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:10,469
- You know what I mean? It flows.
- Yeah?

935
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:20,996
Come on, come on!

936
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:23,196
Come on, baby, come on!

937
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:25,510
Stick him, come on! Stick him!

938
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:28,239
Is this a good time
to go through the script?

939
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:31,869
He can't put a fuckin' combination
together. Look at this shit.

940
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:34,394
Come on, baby. Stick him!

941
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:36,835
Come on, let's shoot some craps.

942
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:40,515
If we get our business out of the way
you can gamble with a clear mind.

943
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:42,556
- You shoot crap?
- I don't, no.

944
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:44,596
- I'll teach you.
- I know the rules,

945
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:48,150
but I didn't bring much money,
not realising that I would be here.

946
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:51,312
- I'll advance you the cash.
- From our royalties, right?

947
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:53,755
- I wanted to talk about the opening.
- Sure.

948
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:59,437
- It feels a little rushed.
- It is, it needs way more build-up.

949
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:02,034
No, not build-up.
Character development.

950
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:05,237
Who is this guy, Sonny?
Why does he need to score so badly?

951
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:07,470
You have such a feel
for the material.

952
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:09,516
Shoot 'em, babe.

953
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:15,119
Shit, man, you're cursed!
It ain't your night.

954
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:19,034
I can't believe
I ran through $6,000 so fast!

955
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:22,908
- It's just making me...
- All right. 7 or 11, gimme the dice!

956
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,309
- 7 or 11, baby.
- You know...

957
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:28,517
- Come on, baby.
- You know after the opening scene...

958
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:39,034
Hey, man, you partake in this?

959
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:42,874
Well, I have some alcohol,
so... Not really.

960
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:46,919
I was wondering about the way
I handled the robbery.

961
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,070
I think it's a terrific sequence.

962
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:51,799
- Needs a complete rewrite.
- It needs some work.

963
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:55,634
Nobody'd ever believe you could steal
an armoured car in daylight.

964
00:58:55,720 --> 00:58:57,836
There's not enough subterfuge.

965
00:58:57,920 --> 00:58:59,831
That's for you, baby.

966
00:59:00,920 --> 00:59:04,230
- You like her?
- Well, she's a perfect person.

967
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:07,676
- Nice ass.
- With some helicopter shots...

968
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:09,910
Let's take this party inside.

969
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:13,276
If I could talk a little more
in-depth about the denouement...

970
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:16,352
I feel that there's a chance
to say something special.

971
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:22,469
I didn't realise you were, um...
Excuse me, Brandon.

972
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:26,030
We can finish this in a second.
I don't wanna get in the way.

973
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:30,796
Oh, yeah. Why don't you slip into bed
and we'll be there in one minute, OK?

974
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:33,599
- OK.
- Excuse, you got a second?

975
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:35,875
This is an unfamiliar
scenario to me.

976
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:40,112
I know Gina from before, all right?
You will not be sorry. Trust me.

977
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:42,236
- You mean all of us?
- Yeah.

978
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:46,791
What's the matter, you never been
with more than two broads before?

979
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:50,350
The woman thing is not... The guy
thing I'm a little uncomfortable...

980
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:54,797
You know we're not getting together,
right? You like women, don't you?

981
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:59,237
If it was on their own, you know,
two, five, 500...

982
00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:03,632
- So my presence disturbs you?
- No, a naked man, conceptually...

983
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:06,996
A naked guy is not an issue for me,
but I just...

984
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:10,072
- Do we need the door?
- You been in a boys' locker room?

985
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:14,073
Of course I have.
I have track medals. I was all-city.

986
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:17,630
- I don't get it. What's the problem?
- I don't know how to put it.

987
01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:21,554
You know, a wave of panic at the
proximity of unclad male genitalia,

988
01:00:21,640 --> 01:00:25,349
in conjunction with the specific
activity, plus I'm still airsick.

989
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:28,796
- I don't know that I can...
- You writers are so sensitive.

990
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:32,919
You should be writing greeting cards,
not fucking scripts.

991
01:00:45,120 --> 01:00:47,554
What's the matter? Not in the mood?

992
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:52,714
I'm just a little tired,
drunk, actually. Just had alcohol.

993
01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:57,639
Brandon tells me you're his writer.

994
01:00:57,720 --> 01:01:00,075
Well, you know, I'm a writer.

995
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:04,199
- I write. I wrote some film scripts.
- Really?

996
01:01:04,280 --> 01:01:07,033
Have you ever heard of Chekhov?

997
01:01:07,120 --> 01:01:09,429
- I have.
- I write like him.

998
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:12,716
You write like him?

999
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:26,678
Brandon, how do you feel
about the scene at the church

1000
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:29,069
where Sonnyboy
gets killed by his brother?

1001
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:32,550
Listen, we're gonna definitely
speak about this again.

1002
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:35,598
I'm going to Africa tomorrow
to do this picture,

1003
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:37,750
then I have another picture in LA.

1004
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:41,833
Then maybe we'll have time to talk.
But I really wanna do your script.

1005
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:46,436
It just needs a little work, and
I need some time to think about it.

1006
01:01:46,520 --> 01:01:48,875
Have a great drive back to New York.

1007
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:51,633
My agent's gonna call you
about the $6,000.

1008
01:01:51,720 --> 01:01:54,712
Maybe you can pay it back
in instalments. All right?

1009
01:01:56,080 --> 01:01:59,117
Yeah, Bonnie? Yeah, you sitting down?

1010
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:04,159
No, I just, er...
I guess I just woke up.

1011
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:08,878
I've decided
I'm gonna finish my novel.

1012
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:12,714
Yeah, I know. I'm not gonna let
anything stand in my way.

1013
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:17,157
I'm gonna work nights, weekends,
whatever it takes, cos I...

1014
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:22,030
Well, I came home, I went to take out
the chapters I'd written to look at.

1015
01:02:22,120 --> 01:02:27,240
I couldn't find them, and I thought,
"Maybe I've thrown them out,"

1016
01:02:27,320 --> 01:02:29,276
and I panicked.

1017
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:33,397
No, then I found them.
God, but that panic.

1018
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:37,837
You know, it made me realise
how dear they are to me.

1019
01:02:38,680 --> 01:02:42,559
You know, so I re-read
what I'd written and I just...

1020
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:48,317
You know, they contain
every aspiration that I've had,

1021
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:52,359
every authentic feeling, every idea.

1022
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:56,718
And I got no choice, I have
to complete this, this is me.

1023
01:02:56,800 --> 01:02:59,951
I... I love this book.

1024
01:03:00,040 --> 01:03:01,792
I love this book.

1025
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:05,394
Well... Well, thank you.

1026
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:28,673
- Hi. Come in.
- Thank you.

1027
01:03:28,760 --> 01:03:30,876
- Are you OK?
- OK?

1028
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:33,394
- You seemed tense on the phone.
- No, no.

1029
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:38,395
- Come in. You want a drink?
- I wouldn't mind some white wine.

1030
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:40,516
- If you have it.
- Yeah.

1031
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:44,672
So, let me explain.

1032
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:48,957
When we spoke backstage
after the show,

1033
01:03:49,040 --> 01:03:54,239
we just touched lightly on,
for want of a better term,

1034
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:56,276
sexual technique.

1035
01:03:56,360 --> 01:03:58,669
Do you recall? You know,
some do's and don'ts.

1036
01:03:58,760 --> 01:04:03,117
Certain strategies for...
pleasing a man in bed.

1037
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:05,992
Yeah.

1038
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:08,036
I don't know...

1039
01:04:08,120 --> 01:04:10,076
why I'm so rattled.

1040
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:14,517
I said this so clearly on my pillow
last night, now I'm all disjointed.

1041
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:17,433
- Have a little more wine.
- Thank you.

1042
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:21,229
I've, um, I've decided I want you
to show me a few things.

1043
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:23,993
- On television?
- No, no. For me.

1044
01:04:24,080 --> 01:04:25,718
Personally.

1045
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:27,756
Let me explain.

1046
01:04:29,480 --> 01:04:35,032
The man I'm going with, whom I love
very dearly, is very sexually active.

1047
01:04:35,120 --> 01:04:37,759
Which is great. You know, great.

1048
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:42,311
We are... We have
a very, very solid sex life.

1049
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:45,676
Very physical.
Well, obviously, physical.

1050
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:48,320
And the sad truth is, um...

1051
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:51,995
Well, no. I've only recently
got divorced.

1052
01:04:52,080 --> 01:04:56,039
After being married to the same
man since I was in college, but...

1053
01:04:56,120 --> 01:04:59,157
you know, who was all
I'd experienced and, er...

1054
01:04:59,240 --> 01:05:04,155
I say this confidentially
because I respect you professionally.

1055
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:09,035
I think that I disappointed
him, sexually.

1056
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:13,515
You know, I come from
a very uptight, proper family,

1057
01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:17,479
and I was taught,
growing up, you know,

1058
01:05:17,560 --> 01:05:21,394
that a lot of acts
of lovemaking are wrong.

1059
01:05:21,480 --> 01:05:24,199
In my mother's eyes,
actually, quite sinful.

1060
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:27,236
And so...

1061
01:05:28,120 --> 01:05:30,793
I went to a Catholic school,
you know.

1062
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:35,112
Not that Tony complains,
but I feel that...

1063
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:37,156
that I'm not really, um...

1064
01:05:37,240 --> 01:05:39,037
That he's being kind.

1065
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:42,794
It's probably a testament to his
feelings for me

1066
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:46,475
that he desires me as frequently
as he does and he enjoys it.

1067
01:05:46,560 --> 01:05:48,755
Don't get me wrong, we both do.

1068
01:05:48,840 --> 01:05:52,037
I love being wanted
and the actual act itself.

1069
01:05:52,120 --> 01:05:54,315
But I just feel...

1070
01:05:55,600 --> 01:06:00,230
that I can do better, you know,
that I want him to have the best.

1071
01:06:00,320 --> 01:06:05,633
I don't want him to start longing
for experiences with other women,

1072
01:06:05,720 --> 01:06:08,280
I don't think I could
take that again.

1073
01:06:08,360 --> 01:06:11,272
Is any of this making
any sense to you at all?

1074
01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:15,872
Yeah. So what you're
asking for is lessons.

1075
01:06:15,960 --> 01:06:17,951
I guess so. Yeah.

1076
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:22,397
I mean, I'm sure this is highly
unusual. Of course, you get paid.

1077
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:24,835
Why don't you go to
one of those therapists?

1078
01:06:24,920 --> 01:06:29,038
Oh, no. I don't wanna
get clinical with Tony, I...

1079
01:06:29,120 --> 01:06:32,908
I wanted to learn it from someone
who'll teach it to me...

1080
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,560
down and dirty,
if you know what I mean.

1081
01:06:35,640 --> 01:06:37,790
I'm just wondering where we'd begin.

1082
01:06:37,880 --> 01:06:40,553
- How about oral sex?
- Oh, yeah?

1083
01:06:40,640 --> 01:06:45,316
Because, you know, somehow I feel...
It doesn't come naturally to me.

1084
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:50,029
It's laboured. I have trouble
breathing, actually,

1085
01:06:50,120 --> 01:06:53,635
and once a cap for my tooth fell off
and I swallowed it.

1086
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:56,991
Do you enjoy it?

1087
01:06:58,280 --> 01:07:01,033
I... I certainly don't mind it.

1088
01:07:01,120 --> 01:07:03,236
Yeah, but do you enjoy it?

1089
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:06,915
What goes through your mind
when you're doing it?

1090
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:09,752
The Crucifixion.

1091
01:07:09,840 --> 01:07:12,593
I can't help it, it's my upbringing.

1092
01:07:12,680 --> 01:07:15,911
All right, why don't you just
show me how you do it?

1093
01:07:16,680 --> 01:07:18,432
- Go ahead.
- Now?

1094
01:07:18,520 --> 01:07:22,672
Yeah. Take the banana and give me
your best blow job. Go ahead.

1095
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:25,796
Yeah, go ahead. Down the hatch.

1096
01:07:35,360 --> 01:07:38,477
Oh, my God.
Have you ever injured him?

1097
01:07:38,560 --> 01:07:41,996
- No. Why, is that too hard?
- Well, it's a little rough.

1098
01:07:42,080 --> 01:07:45,675
Oh, you see? I'm over-eager.
I was trying too hard.

1099
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:48,911
It's all right. Tell you what.
I'll show you how to do it.

1100
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:52,390
Watch. It's a gentle,
slow, medium-slow motion,

1101
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:55,790
get as much in your mouth as...
Depth is very important.

1102
01:07:55,880 --> 01:07:58,075
- Right.
- Watch this, right?

1103
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:08,672
OK.

1104
01:08:14,360 --> 01:08:16,555
Oh, my God. Are you choking?

1105
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:19,996
You're choking! Oh, my God!

1106
01:08:22,320 --> 01:08:24,675
OK. Arms up, let me just...

1107
01:08:28,440 --> 01:08:30,908
Oh, my God! Put your arms up again.

1108
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:32,752
Thrust!

1109
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:35,714
Is that out?

1110
01:08:35,800 --> 01:08:37,756
I am so sorry.

1111
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:41,472
- Do you want some water?
- I'm OK, I'm OK.

1112
01:08:42,320 --> 01:08:45,630
- I feel so dreadful. It's my fault.
- No, it's all right.

1113
01:08:45,720 --> 01:08:48,075
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

1114
01:08:48,160 --> 01:08:49,752
Oh, dear.

1115
01:08:49,840 --> 01:08:53,594
- I'm OK. Yeah.
- I think I need some more practice.

1116
01:08:53,680 --> 01:08:56,240
- Well...
- Should you be smoking?

1117
01:08:56,320 --> 01:08:59,232
Oh, yeah. Yeah, all right.

1118
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:05,315
A toast - to Sid Melnick!

1119
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:10,552
And to the best book written about
the CIA in ten years!

1120
01:09:11,720 --> 01:09:14,473
I don't know where all his
insecurities come from.

1121
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:17,199
- He needs another drink.
- I'll have another.

1122
01:09:17,280 --> 01:09:19,555
Good idea. Please refill me.

1123
01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:24,118
- Bonnie's terrific.
- Yeah, she's a wonderful editor.

1124
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:26,555
I sense she's gradually
taking control

1125
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:28,915
of that cosmic chaos
you call your life.

1126
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:33,391
I figured, "Fuck it." We've been
practically living together.

1127
01:09:33,480 --> 01:09:38,395
Why not? I made the commitment, she
gave up her place and moved in today.

1128
01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:41,552
You know what I hate about
promotional book tours?

1129
01:09:41,640 --> 01:09:44,916
You work your ass off in a strange
city, knock yourself out,

1130
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,639
you go to a book store,
they don't have your book.

1131
01:09:47,720 --> 01:09:49,870
- They never stock your book.
- I know.

1132
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:53,794
- What are you working on?
- The famous screenplay went nowhere.

1133
01:09:53,880 --> 01:09:57,793
You need a star and it's
fucking death, the humiliation.

1134
01:09:57,880 --> 01:10:01,350
- Business.
- Total, you know?

1135
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:04,910
- Tell 'em what you've been doing.
- Oh, please.

1136
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:08,436
- What is it?
- I'm almost finished with a novel.

1137
01:10:08,520 --> 01:10:13,071
- Oh, really?
- I've been slaving over it a year,

1138
01:10:13,160 --> 01:10:17,039
but the reception my previous books
got, I'm a glutton for punishment.

1139
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:20,590
- This will be a huge success.
- He's being modest.

1140
01:10:20,680 --> 01:10:22,796
- It's great.
- You read it?

1141
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:25,599
You gonna go by my new roommate now?

1142
01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:27,955
- She has no agenda here.
- No, no, no.

1143
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:38,671
- Hey, Tony. Hey, how are you?
- Fine.

1144
01:10:38,760 --> 01:10:40,876
I know these guys. Excuse me.

1145
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:43,349
Hey, Lee. Good to see you again.

1146
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:46,910
- This is Nola.
- Hi. How are you?

1147
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,958
That's Bonnie and that's Kevin.
That's Lee.

1148
01:10:51,160 --> 01:10:53,515
- How are you?
- I'm good.

1149
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:57,275
- Here we go.
- Do you mind if I? Thank you.

1150
01:10:58,680 --> 01:11:00,511
- How's it going?
- Very good.

1151
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:02,830
So, how you doin'?

1152
01:11:02,920 --> 01:11:06,549
I'm good, I've finished
a very long article.

1153
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:11,111
I was working on it for five months,
and then we've been vacationing.

1154
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:13,156
Where'd you go?

1155
01:11:13,240 --> 01:11:16,312
We went to California.
Have you read Sid's book?

1156
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:18,356
- How have you been?
- Good.

1157
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:22,479
- I liked it very much. A bit long.
- Oh, I didn't find it long.

1158
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:25,996
- How's your acting career?
- Slow but breathing.

1159
01:11:26,080 --> 01:11:29,356
- You still work in Chippers?
- You remembered!

1160
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:34,873
What was the spy movie
we saw on TV about the hawk and...

1161
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:37,315
The Falcon And The Snowman.

1162
01:11:37,400 --> 01:11:41,439
- Didn't it remind you of that?
- Maybe I don't remember the movie.

1163
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:45,877
- Young spies, they're in trouble?
- Sort of...

1164
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:49,396
- What have you been doing?
- Nothing very exciting.

1165
01:11:49,480 --> 01:11:51,198
I called you last Friday.

1166
01:11:51,280 --> 01:11:55,034
I'm sorry, I got your message.
We stayed on in California.

1167
01:11:55,120 --> 01:11:57,714
Cos she's never been
to San Francisco.

1168
01:11:57,800 --> 01:12:00,439
- Oh, I love that town.
- It's wonderful.

1169
01:12:00,520 --> 01:12:04,308
- Until I tried to drive!
- Oh, my God! No, no, no, no.

1170
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:06,834
I've never been
more terrified in my life.

1171
01:12:06,920 --> 01:12:09,673
You should have seen...
We were airborne.

1172
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:12,558
It was a special effects movie
on the hills.

1173
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:14,676
Was it automatic or standard?

1174
01:12:14,760 --> 01:12:17,957
I don't know. I was just
clutching the thing for my life.

1175
01:12:18,040 --> 01:12:20,395
- Where did you stay?
- The Fairmont.

1176
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:23,153
How did you meet David?

1177
01:12:23,240 --> 01:12:28,519
How did we meet? Actually, I took
her away from a Nobel scientist.

1178
01:12:28,600 --> 01:12:32,275
No, I wasn't going out with him.
I was his translator.

1179
01:12:32,360 --> 01:12:34,351
- Translator?
- Yes, and companion.

1180
01:12:34,440 --> 01:12:37,989
And she translated so well
that he offered to dump his wife.

1181
01:12:38,080 --> 01:12:41,231
You make it sound so much more
interesting than it was.

1182
01:12:41,320 --> 01:12:43,629
- Really?
- Excuse me.

1183
01:13:08,120 --> 01:13:11,032
Lee! You got a minute, Lee?

1184
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:13,873
- Say hello to Shelly Rubin.
- How are ya?

1185
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:17,111
You gotta catch this kid.
Great young comic.

1186
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:21,591
Somebody's gotta do a piece on him.
Next Robin Williams.

1187
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:26,475
Do Jack Nicholson at the Seder
for him. This is hysterical.

1188
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:28,790
Just attended my first Seder.

1189
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:31,314
What a shindig that was.

1190
01:13:31,400 --> 01:13:33,709
Haggadah this, haggadah that.

1191
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:37,998
I think the only thing you gotta do
is drink a lot of wine.

1192
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:40,355
- Uncanny.
- Isn't it great?

1193
01:13:40,440 --> 01:13:44,274
I'm so grateful to have seen it live.
You have a great future.

1194
01:13:44,360 --> 01:13:47,079
I got more. California red wine
for the Manichewitz.

1195
01:13:47,160 --> 01:13:49,151
Thanks, Lee. We'll hook up.

1196
01:13:49,240 --> 01:13:52,073
- We should talk and meet.
- Nice talking to you.

1197
01:13:52,160 --> 01:13:54,116
We'll be in touch.

1198
01:13:54,200 --> 01:13:57,636
- Hi.
- I'm dying of comedy poisoning.

1199
01:13:57,720 --> 01:13:59,676
You never came by.

1200
01:14:00,760 --> 01:14:03,672
I don't know why.
I got sidetracked, I guess.

1201
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:08,038
That's all right. Although I was sure
you'd come looking for me.

1202
01:14:08,120 --> 01:14:11,351
All that talk about my great face.

1203
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:14,318
Well, it still looks... exquisite.

1204
01:14:15,040 --> 01:14:18,555
Under these lights, especially,
you look fantastic.

1205
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:22,428
Is that your girlfriend or are you
gonna tell me she's a transvestite?

1206
01:14:22,520 --> 01:14:24,909
No, she's just...
You know, she's a friend.

1207
01:14:26,040 --> 01:14:28,952
- She's really beautiful.
- I'll get you a...

1208
01:14:30,040 --> 01:14:32,998
And so you're...
I guess you're with David, right?

1209
01:14:34,280 --> 01:14:36,953
- Yes and no.
- Meaning?

1210
01:14:38,040 --> 01:14:40,190
What are you doing later?

1211
01:14:41,640 --> 01:14:44,552
Well, I... Later?

1212
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:47,518
After you drop off your date,
are you tied up?

1213
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:50,797
I'm... When later?

1214
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:54,475
I'm gonna meet some friends downtown,
but why don't you meet me?

1215
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:58,553
Meet me at the kiosk
opposite El Teddy's at twelve.

1216
01:14:58,640 --> 01:15:00,676
Twelve noon, like tomorrow?

1217
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:03,672
Twelve tonight,
unless you're tied up.

1218
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:05,478
Twelve tonight?

1219
01:15:05,560 --> 01:15:09,599
Can I make you a more European offer?
A kiosk at midnight.

1220
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:12,273
Sure, sure.

1221
01:15:12,360 --> 01:15:14,999
- Hey. We should get going.
- OK.

1222
01:15:15,080 --> 01:15:17,878
I heard you just finished a novel.
Congratulations.

1223
01:15:17,960 --> 01:15:20,554
It's such a ballbreaker,
you wouldn't believe it.

1224
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:23,154
- Bonnie said she loved it.
- She would.

1225
01:15:23,240 --> 01:15:25,435
She's kind of a ballbreaker.

1226
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:29,479
I hope it's good, I put two years
of my life into it.

1227
01:15:29,560 --> 01:15:33,439
Well, I've never worked longer than
five months on anything, so...

1228
01:15:35,080 --> 01:15:37,435
- Did you hear Erica Jeffers tonight?
- No.

1229
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:40,876
She's writing about her experiences
with the judicial system.

1230
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:42,916
Ought to be a beaut.

1231
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,514
Isn't that Nola a little young
for David Delile?

1232
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:48,478
- Young?
- He's your age, right?

1233
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:49,879
Well, I don't know.

1234
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:55,590
- Are you tired?
- I got a little ulcer problem here.

1235
01:15:55,680 --> 01:15:59,150
Poor baby. You got a tummy ache?
You want your Pepcid?

1236
01:15:59,240 --> 01:16:01,470
I checked. We're all out.

1237
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:05,553
- I think you got some Mylanta.
- Only the Pepcid works for me.

1238
01:16:05,640 --> 01:16:10,316
- I'm gonna go to the drugstore.
- Now? But I'm half undressed.

1239
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:12,356
You don't have to come.

1240
01:16:12,440 --> 01:16:15,591
You should go to bed,
and don't be silly because...

1241
01:16:15,680 --> 01:16:21,198
You know, it's not like I need
an escort to, you know, go to the...

1242
01:16:21,280 --> 01:16:22,872
drugstore.

1243
01:16:22,960 --> 01:16:27,715
I should get this fixed cos this
is gonna bug me all night if I don't.

1244
01:16:27,800 --> 01:16:31,554
All right, but be back soon. The
moving men are coming early tomorrow.

1245
01:16:31,640 --> 01:16:34,916
I know, I won't forget.
What is the time now?

1246
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,992
- 11:45. I'll see you soon.
- Give me a kiss.

1247
01:16:38,080 --> 01:16:40,275
- Make it very soon, OK?
- I'm sorry.

1248
01:16:40,360 --> 01:16:42,316
I'm beat.

1249
01:17:10,240 --> 01:17:13,471
Sorry I'm late. Hope you haven't
been waiting too long.

1250
01:17:14,840 --> 01:17:18,276
You're not late.
Listen, I have to level with you.

1251
01:17:18,360 --> 01:17:21,796
I can't really go anywhere
right now. I...

1252
01:17:21,880 --> 01:17:23,871
I don't know where to begin.

1253
01:17:23,960 --> 01:17:29,034
My luck's been lousy, I got myself
into a situation for whatever reason.

1254
01:17:29,120 --> 01:17:32,874
I was married a long time, I thought
that I would be better single.

1255
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:38,353
That's been great. It's been
wild in a way, but lonely too,

1256
01:17:38,440 --> 01:17:43,514
and I should've come by for you
the minute I met you and I didn't.

1257
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:47,593
And I think the reason that I didn't
was that I was wary of you

1258
01:17:47,680 --> 01:17:51,195
because you triggered
some real feelings inside me

1259
01:17:51,280 --> 01:17:53,635
and so yet again, I fucked up.

1260
01:17:53,720 --> 01:17:57,156
But I'm gonna rectify things
before I get in any deeper,

1261
01:17:57,240 --> 01:17:59,595
so please,
what are you doing tomorrow?

1262
01:18:00,680 --> 01:18:04,070
Wow! Is that you or your new novel?

1263
01:18:04,160 --> 01:18:06,913
I'm gonna be OK by tomorrow,
I promise.

1264
01:18:07,960 --> 01:18:12,556
Well, look, I don't wanna cause
anybody any problems, you know?

1265
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:14,596
Sure. What about you and David?

1266
01:18:14,680 --> 01:18:19,310
I've told David many times I need
someone who can take control of me

1267
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:22,437
- and I don't think he can do it.
- No?

1268
01:18:22,520 --> 01:18:25,717
And believe me, every guy I meet
thinks he's the one

1269
01:18:25,800 --> 01:18:29,839
who's gonna make me faithful,
so just be warned.

1270
01:18:29,920 --> 01:18:32,639
Well, you should know,
I don't scare that easily.

1271
01:18:32,720 --> 01:18:35,280
I'm just telling you,
because you don't know me.

1272
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:37,874
I know you, I've written
about you twice.

1273
01:18:37,960 --> 01:18:41,509
You were the obscure object of desire
in books that I've written.

1274
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:46,390
The books failed - my fault, not
yours - but I know you inside out.

1275
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:50,029
- It's scary.
- You didn't make me up.

1276
01:18:50,120 --> 01:18:53,078
Well, whatever restlessness
you've experienced,

1277
01:18:53,160 --> 01:18:55,958
whatever moodiness
and unpredictability

1278
01:18:56,040 --> 01:18:59,589
you've broken hearts with,
you're a...

1279
01:18:59,680 --> 01:19:02,399
Baby, you're a heartbreaker. It's...

1280
01:19:02,480 --> 01:19:04,436
It's all over tonight.

1281
01:19:06,440 --> 01:19:10,672
Where did you get that confidence?
Or are you scared?

1282
01:19:10,760 --> 01:19:15,356
I'm not David. I created you twice
in fiction out of my own imagination.

1283
01:19:15,440 --> 01:19:18,557
I wrote about you
before I even knew that you existed

1284
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:21,359
except that one day
I knew that I would meet you.

1285
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:24,596
Well, what am I thinking?

1286
01:19:24,680 --> 01:19:28,753
You're thinking, "I wish this guy
would shut up and kiss me."

1287
01:19:28,840 --> 01:19:31,400
- But you're late.
- I'm not late.

1288
01:19:31,480 --> 01:19:33,630
I think I'm right on time for you.

1289
01:19:33,720 --> 01:19:37,508
Except why would I kiss you here when
your apartment's two blocks away?

1290
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:39,909
- How did you know that?
- Why wouldn't I?

1291
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:44,278
You were Steffi in my first book
and Louise in my second.

1292
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:47,316
Now...

1293
01:19:48,840 --> 01:19:50,796
you're Nola.

1294
01:20:17,560 --> 01:20:19,312
- Hello?
- Movers.

1295
01:20:19,400 --> 01:20:23,518
Would you come right up, please?
I'll just leave the door open.

1296
01:20:37,360 --> 01:20:39,920
- Wake up! Hi.
- Hi.

1297
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,639
- Moving men are here with my stuff.
- What?

1298
01:20:42,720 --> 01:20:44,676
I'm sorry about last night.

1299
01:20:44,760 --> 01:20:48,116
The second you left for the drugstore
I conked out like a zombie.

1300
01:20:48,200 --> 01:20:51,112
You must have been so disappointed
when you got back.

1301
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:54,192
- The moving men are here already?
- Yup. It's 7:30.

1302
01:20:54,280 --> 01:20:56,714
- Listen, Bonnie...
- I've made some coffee.

1303
01:20:56,800 --> 01:20:59,109
- Bonnie, listen.
- What is it?

1304
01:20:59,200 --> 01:21:02,237
I have to talk to you.

1305
01:21:02,320 --> 01:21:04,276
Right. I'm paying attention.

1306
01:21:04,360 --> 01:21:08,558
Look, you've got to listen.
I've done a terrible thing.

1307
01:21:08,640 --> 01:21:11,029
I bet you've done a really bad thing.

1308
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:14,476
- No, you should listen, because...
- All right.

1309
01:21:14,560 --> 01:21:17,950
I don't know how
to say this, but I, erm...

1310
01:21:18,040 --> 01:21:22,238
- Listen, I wanna call this off.
- What are you talkin' about?

1311
01:21:22,320 --> 01:21:24,311
You're gonna think I'm the worst,

1312
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:27,233
most fucked-up son of a bitch
in the world and I am.

1313
01:21:27,320 --> 01:21:31,074
I'm gonna try in my own stupid way
to be honest and I...

1314
01:21:31,160 --> 01:21:33,594
I met somebody else, Bonnie.

1315
01:21:34,920 --> 01:21:36,876
You what?

1316
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:39,235
I met somebody else. I...

1317
01:21:40,160 --> 01:21:43,311
I met somebody else.
I don't know how else to say it.

1318
01:21:43,400 --> 01:21:46,870
- How could you?
- You have every right to hate me.

1319
01:21:46,960 --> 01:21:49,918
- I'm so screwed up.
- I just moved in yesterday.

1320
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:53,151
I'm so screwed up.
I wish I could put it another way.

1321
01:21:53,240 --> 01:21:55,834
I can't believe what I'm hearing.

1322
01:21:55,920 --> 01:21:59,151
- This thing of moving in together...
- It was your idea!

1323
01:21:59,240 --> 01:22:03,472
- I know, I know...
- When did you meet "somebody else"?

1324
01:22:03,560 --> 01:22:07,951
- It's not important.
- I've rearranged my goddamn life!

1325
01:22:08,040 --> 01:22:11,749
- I know. This is so difficult.
- You said you loved me!

1326
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:14,877
I thought that I did
and believe me, I wanted to.

1327
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:17,520
You're such a wonderful, wonderful...

1328
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:20,034
You know what?
You're a sick son of a bitch!

1329
01:22:20,120 --> 01:22:22,236
- Excuse me...
- No!

1330
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:26,279
- Could you just get the fuck out?
- I accept full responsibility.

1331
01:22:26,360 --> 01:22:29,079
- Let's get out of here.
- I'm a total asshole.

1332
01:22:29,160 --> 01:22:33,358
- Yeah, you are a total asshole!
- But I thought that if I was honest

1333
01:22:33,440 --> 01:22:36,876
and brought it up openly,
that we could understand

1334
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:40,077
that I really and truly
do not mean you any harm.

1335
01:22:40,160 --> 01:22:44,073
Because I know how you feel and
believe me, I feel so, so bad,

1336
01:22:44,160 --> 01:22:46,833
but if we just accept me as sick

1337
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:49,912
and just try to, I know
it's hard, remain rational.

1338
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:53,151
We can do this with
the minimum of disruption.

1339
01:22:53,240 --> 01:22:57,153
Naturally, you can store your stuff
here for a while, and I'll...

1340
01:22:57,240 --> 01:23:01,233
- You're a fucking psychotic!
- Bonnie, this is so hard, I just...

1341
01:23:01,320 --> 01:23:04,232
I'm so... Oh, boy.

1342
01:23:06,360 --> 01:23:10,319
What are you doing with my novel?
What are?

1343
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:12,755
That's an only copy! Bonnie!

1344
01:23:19,360 --> 01:23:24,639
Hey, buddy. Did you see a woman come
out of here with, like, a manuscript?

1345
01:23:24,720 --> 01:23:28,474
- I saw a girl come out of this door.
- Where did she go?

1346
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:30,915
She ran right across the street.

1347
01:24:23,080 --> 01:24:25,640
In five, four, three...

1348
01:24:27,800 --> 01:24:32,669
And now Manhattan Moods goes live to
a new feature, Luncheon At Le Bijou.

1349
01:24:34,040 --> 01:24:37,874
Hi, I'm Robin Simon.
Welcome to Luncheon At Le Bijou,

1350
01:24:37,960 --> 01:24:41,999
New York's most exciting restaurant,
where every day is a potpourri

1351
01:24:42,080 --> 01:24:46,471
of the city's most
rich and famous residents.

1352
01:24:46,560 --> 01:24:49,438
I'm sitting here talking to
Evelyn Isaacs,

1353
01:24:49,520 --> 01:24:52,273
Manhattan's most exclusive
real estate broker,

1354
01:24:52,360 --> 01:24:54,316
who has situated...

1355
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:56,595
- Is that correct?
- I like it.

1356
01:24:56,680 --> 01:25:00,195
...the cream of the city's
most luminous residents.

1357
01:25:00,280 --> 01:25:03,431
You were saying that you couldn't
get rock star Ennis Taylor

1358
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:05,988
- into the apartment he wanted.
- That's right.

1359
01:25:06,080 --> 01:25:09,516
The tenants didn't want groupies
hanging around.

1360
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:11,875
They must have been leery
of wild parties.

1361
01:25:11,960 --> 01:25:15,509
Yes, but actually, Ennis isn't what
you'd think from his band.

1362
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:19,479
He's not violent or destructive,
he's quite intellectual and sweet.

1363
01:25:19,560 --> 01:25:23,189
I just think the board of the co-op
had a problem that he owned snakes.

1364
01:25:23,280 --> 01:25:26,716
Not that he'd have to walk them,
but they had a problem with the boas.

1365
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:30,270
- Any other big name turn-downs?
- No, but I got a beautiful triplex

1366
01:25:30,360 --> 01:25:32,112
for the Charles Aranows.

1367
01:25:32,200 --> 01:25:35,875
It's twelve rooms on Park Avenue
and they're having a Hamptons room.

1368
01:25:35,960 --> 01:25:39,316
They're bringing in tons of sand
to cover the floor, so it's fun.

1369
01:25:39,400 --> 01:25:41,994
Well, thank you. I see. Now...

1370
01:25:42,080 --> 01:25:44,230
It's time for me to table-hop,

1371
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:48,916
and let our audience meet some of the
other exciting patrons of Le Bijou.

1372
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:52,276
Look who's here - Senator Bob Paley!
How are you today?

1373
01:25:52,360 --> 01:25:55,557
We're here for
the celebrity golf tournament.

1374
01:25:55,640 --> 01:25:58,598
It earns a lot of money
for the Heart Foundation.

1375
01:25:58,680 --> 01:26:00,830
They say I'm paired with Greg Norman.

1376
01:26:00,920 --> 01:26:05,471
Wonderful! Do you want to make any
comments on the recent allegations?

1377
01:26:05,560 --> 01:26:07,312
I think when the facts are in,

1378
01:26:07,400 --> 01:26:10,870
the Justice Department will conclude
that I made an error in judgment

1379
01:26:10,960 --> 01:26:13,315
but there was no real intent
of treason.

1380
01:26:13,400 --> 01:26:18,315
Well, moving right along, I see
Dee Bartholomew, "Empress of Gossip".

1381
01:26:18,400 --> 01:26:20,197
Robin, hi.

1382
01:26:20,280 --> 01:26:23,590
It's so rainy out today,
this gloomy weather.

1383
01:26:23,680 --> 01:26:26,638
But I love your pin.
Is that Georgian?

1384
01:26:26,720 --> 01:26:29,154
Oh, thank you. No, it's art nouveau.

1385
01:26:29,240 --> 01:26:34,189
- And where did you get it?
- My first husband gave it to me.

1386
01:26:34,280 --> 01:26:38,193
When you say first, do I detect
a second on the way? Robin?

1387
01:26:38,280 --> 01:26:40,953
- Well...
- I ran into our Tony Gardello.

1388
01:26:41,040 --> 01:26:46,637
He had a blissed-out look,
like he had died and gone to heaven.

1389
01:26:46,720 --> 01:26:49,837
How did you manage
to put that smile on his face?

1390
01:26:51,360 --> 01:26:53,476
- Using my head.
- I'm sure.

1391
01:26:53,560 --> 01:26:56,552
Do you have any choice items
for our viewers?

1392
01:26:56,640 --> 01:26:59,313
Very prominent actress-slash-singer

1393
01:26:59,400 --> 01:27:02,631
has become pregnant while visiting
Buckingham Palace.

1394
01:27:02,720 --> 01:27:07,236
- No names, please.
- Well, thank you.

1395
01:27:08,280 --> 01:27:12,068
Look who's here. Donald Trump.
What are you working on, Donald?

1396
01:27:12,160 --> 01:27:14,720
I'm working on buying
St Patrick's Cathedral,

1397
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:19,078
maybe doing a little rip-down job
and putting up a very tall building.

1398
01:27:19,160 --> 01:27:20,878
Wonderful!

1399
01:27:20,960 --> 01:27:22,916
- You were great!
- I was terrible.

1400
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,355
- You said you couldn't do it.
- I got mixed up.

1401
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:27,396
- I said, "You can."
- I was a jerk.

1402
01:27:27,480 --> 01:27:30,756
No actress-turned-interviewer
could do it as real.

1403
01:27:30,840 --> 01:27:32,956
You're not a jerk. You were real.

1404
01:27:33,040 --> 01:27:36,669
Nobody cares if you're unpolished
and awkward. It's appealing.

1405
01:27:36,760 --> 01:27:38,512
This is your 15 minutes of fame.

1406
01:27:38,600 --> 01:27:41,398
I never believed
what Andy Warhol said

1407
01:27:41,480 --> 01:27:44,790
about everybody being famous
for 15 minutes.

1408
01:27:44,880 --> 01:27:49,351
Almost nobody will ever be famous
for even one minute, so enjoy it!

1409
01:27:49,440 --> 01:27:52,034
OK. How did I manage to swing this?

1410
01:27:52,120 --> 01:27:56,272
Last year I was teaching English,
performing a serious function.

1411
01:27:56,360 --> 01:27:59,113
And suddenly, through
a whirlwind series of events,

1412
01:27:59,200 --> 01:28:01,555
I've become the kind of woman
I've always hated.

1413
01:28:01,640 --> 01:28:03,790
But I'm happier.

1414
01:28:03,880 --> 01:28:06,997
- Are you nervous about Saturday?
- Are you?

1415
01:28:07,080 --> 01:28:09,196
I'm counting the seconds.

1416
01:28:12,400 --> 01:28:14,516
I can't believe
my hands are sweating.

1417
01:28:14,600 --> 01:28:17,034
- You got the ring?
- What am I, a schmuck?

1418
01:28:17,120 --> 01:28:20,032
- Sophisticated. Very educated.
- Yes, I know.

1419
01:28:20,120 --> 01:28:22,076
Oh, picture.

1420
01:28:22,160 --> 01:28:25,596
I like this girl, I really do.
I think she's terrific.

1421
01:28:25,680 --> 01:28:29,116
It's so ironic. You go to get
face work, you don't get face work.

1422
01:28:29,200 --> 01:28:31,953
But you meet a wonderful guy
who changes your life.

1423
01:28:32,040 --> 01:28:33,996
It's better than face work.

1424
01:28:34,080 --> 01:28:37,038
- Do you think this looks OK?
- You look perfect.

1425
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:41,511
- Expected a bigger turnout.
- Ma, they wanted to keep it small.

1426
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:43,397
Isn't that, er...

1427
01:28:43,480 --> 01:28:47,109
Al Swayze. He's a friend of Tony's.
Does the weather.

1428
01:28:47,200 --> 01:28:50,272
Oh, right. He does the weather
on channel...

1429
01:28:50,360 --> 01:28:52,316
Hello, how do you do?

1430
01:28:52,400 --> 01:28:55,949
- Well, congratulations.
- Thank you. My daughter, Iris.

1431
01:28:56,040 --> 01:28:59,350
- Mama, he does the weather!
- We enjoy watching you so much.

1432
01:28:59,440 --> 01:29:02,796
- Nice to meet you too.
- We watch you give the weather.

1433
01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:06,873
- I mean, you're usually wrong.
- Occupational hazard.

1434
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:09,520
But you're cheerful.
You're all so cheerful.

1435
01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:10,555
Yeah.

1436
01:29:50,640 --> 01:29:52,835
I can't find her. Did you see her?

1437
01:29:52,920 --> 01:29:56,913
- Did I? What happened?
- She's not in the bathroom.

1438
01:29:57,000 --> 01:30:00,913
- You were just with her.
- I don't know what happened to her.

1439
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:02,956
Frankie, come on.

1440
01:30:03,040 --> 01:30:05,952
- Relax.
- How? She's gotta be somewhere.

1441
01:30:06,040 --> 01:30:07,792
We'll find her.

1442
01:30:07,880 --> 01:30:10,838
- What's going on?
- It's all right, Ma, it's nothing.

1443
01:30:10,920 --> 01:30:12,956
Everything's gonna be all right.

1444
01:30:13,040 --> 01:30:14,996
She walked out about 20 minutes ago.

1445
01:30:15,080 --> 01:30:17,036
- Where did she go?
- I didn't see.

1446
01:30:17,120 --> 01:30:18,997
- She was alone?
- Yeah.

1447
01:30:19,080 --> 01:30:22,436
Frankie, go upstairs, stall 'em.
I'm gonna go look around.

1448
01:30:22,520 --> 01:30:24,590
- Where are you gonna look?
- I don't know.

1449
01:30:24,680 --> 01:30:28,275
You're out of your mind. What am I
gonna tell your mother and father?

1450
01:30:33,560 --> 01:30:37,269
- Everything's fine.
- Is he OK? I hope she's OK.

1451
01:30:37,360 --> 01:30:39,715
- She's nervous, Ma.
- Nervous about what?

1452
01:30:39,800 --> 01:30:43,349
- She needs to fix her makeup.
- Should I go and help her?

1453
01:30:43,440 --> 01:30:46,000
- Tony's all right?
- Please. Don't go help her.

1454
01:30:46,080 --> 01:30:48,389
She's gonna come out.
Iris, leave her alone.

1455
01:30:48,480 --> 01:30:50,436
- Now.
- She's gathering herself.

1456
01:31:02,720 --> 01:31:04,676
- Do you want a reading?
- No, no.

1457
01:31:04,760 --> 01:31:06,910
Come on.
I'll give you a nice reading.

1458
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:10,037
- I was walking.
- You look like you could use one.

1459
01:31:10,120 --> 01:31:12,793
You look like you could.
Come inside with me.

1460
01:31:12,880 --> 01:31:18,113
- I don't really believe in psychics.
- You don't have to believe. Come in.

1461
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,798
- So, what do you do?
- I work in television.

1462
01:31:22,880 --> 01:31:27,078
- You used to do something else, huh?
- That's right. I was a teacher.

1463
01:31:28,160 --> 01:31:31,311
I see, um, the name Beowulf.

1464
01:31:31,400 --> 01:31:34,392
Oh, my God.
Chaucer. I taught Chaucer.

1465
01:31:35,480 --> 01:31:40,349
- Would you like some tea? Mint tea?
- I would love a drink. Is that OK?

1466
01:31:40,440 --> 01:31:42,192
No problem.

1467
01:31:42,280 --> 01:31:44,714
So, you like television better?

1468
01:31:44,800 --> 01:31:48,475
Well, it's interesting to see
who we choose as our celebrities.

1469
01:31:48,560 --> 01:31:50,710
And why. What makes them tick.

1470
01:31:50,800 --> 01:31:54,236
You can learn a lot about a society
by who it chooses to celebrate.

1471
01:31:54,320 --> 01:31:56,356
- Is this good?
- Yes, please.

1472
01:31:56,440 --> 01:32:00,672
We did this whole show on Sunny von
Bulow and she's just a coma patient.

1473
01:32:00,760 --> 01:32:04,639
She just lays there in a coma
but she's a celebrity.

1474
01:32:05,440 --> 01:32:08,034
You were up there with her.
What happened?

1475
01:32:08,120 --> 01:32:09,872
She was OK.

1476
01:32:09,960 --> 01:32:12,520
Everybody, I've got some bad news.

1477
01:32:12,600 --> 01:32:16,070
The wedding's off, so why don't
you just all go on home, OK?

1478
01:32:17,160 --> 01:32:19,628
Thanks. Thank you.

1479
01:32:19,720 --> 01:32:22,075
- Tony...
- It's not gonna happen.

1480
01:32:22,160 --> 01:32:25,311
Just go home,
make sure Mom gets there all right.

1481
01:32:25,400 --> 01:32:29,951
- Are you all right? Is she hurt?
- It's nothing like that. Go on, OK?

1482
01:32:30,040 --> 01:32:33,316
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, yeah. I'm fine.

1483
01:32:39,680 --> 01:32:41,432
- Frankie...
- Tony.

1484
01:32:41,520 --> 01:32:43,636
It's all right. Just...

1485
01:32:43,720 --> 01:32:46,280
I'm here to help you. Whatever.

1486
01:32:55,680 --> 01:32:57,352
You need a change in your life.

1487
01:32:57,440 --> 01:33:00,477
Whatever plans you've been
contemplating, re-evaluate.

1488
01:33:00,560 --> 01:33:02,710
I see you going in
a different direction.

1489
01:33:02,800 --> 01:33:07,078
- I had planned to get married.
- Perhaps this needs more scrutiny.

1490
01:33:07,160 --> 01:33:08,115
Really?

1491
01:33:08,200 --> 01:33:11,510
- When was the wedding planned?
- Today.

1492
01:33:11,600 --> 01:33:16,833
I left him standing at the church
with all his family and friends.

1493
01:33:16,920 --> 01:33:18,990
If you are not sure
that you love him...

1494
01:33:19,080 --> 01:33:21,469
No, I am sure, he's wonderful.

1495
01:33:21,560 --> 01:33:24,597
- So then I don't understand.
- I just feel guilty.

1496
01:33:24,680 --> 01:33:29,435
I've had such good luck. Everybody
I know always has so many problems.

1497
01:33:29,520 --> 01:33:31,909
I just have this great guy
fall in my lap.

1498
01:33:33,040 --> 01:33:36,396
- I still don't get...
- I told him, "You're so terrific.

1499
01:33:36,480 --> 01:33:39,040
"I'm just waiting for
the other shoe to drop."

1500
01:33:39,120 --> 01:33:42,954
Some awful part of him that will ruin
things, but there is no other shoe.

1501
01:33:43,040 --> 01:33:45,190
- You provided that.
- Me?

1502
01:33:45,280 --> 01:33:47,999
He's a wonderful guy,
but you screw things up.

1503
01:33:48,080 --> 01:33:50,594
- Why?
- You said it yourself.

1504
01:33:50,680 --> 01:33:54,832
It's like guilt. You don't need
a fortune teller, you need a shrink.

1505
01:33:54,920 --> 01:33:57,070
- Me?
- You meet this wonderful guy,

1506
01:33:57,160 --> 01:34:01,073
and you can't believe that something
so wonderful can happen to you,

1507
01:34:01,160 --> 01:34:03,116
so you ruin it.

1508
01:34:03,200 --> 01:34:05,919
I did a horrible thing.
He'll never forgive me.

1509
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:07,956
Who could blame him?

1510
01:34:08,040 --> 01:34:11,919
You want your $10 worth of psychic
prediction? He'll forgive you.

1511
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:13,991
Obviously he's crazy about you

1512
01:34:14,080 --> 01:34:17,789
and just because you acted like
a horse's ass don't mean he will.

1513
01:34:17,880 --> 01:34:21,873
So you tell him everything
that you told me. And then...

1514
01:34:21,960 --> 01:34:24,633
- Yeah?
...you give him a big kiss.

1515
01:34:35,480 --> 01:34:37,869
We can be seen.

1516
01:34:37,960 --> 01:34:40,520
Don't you care?

1517
01:34:40,600 --> 01:34:43,592
I don't. I care about you.

1518
01:34:47,360 --> 01:34:49,316
That's perfect!

1519
01:34:49,400 --> 01:34:52,437
Emotionally, it's exactly
where you should be.

1520
01:34:52,520 --> 01:34:56,069
- Really?
- I don't feel like I'm there at all.

1521
01:34:56,160 --> 01:35:01,109
Well, trust it. We'll come back
to this tomorrow, we'll stop for now.

1522
01:35:01,200 --> 01:35:05,955
I feel like I know where she's coming
from, but she's so contradictory.

1523
01:35:06,040 --> 01:35:10,955
Contradiction is good, just don't
contradict yourself when you play it.

1524
01:35:11,040 --> 01:35:14,191
Play one thing at a time
and trust it.

1525
01:35:14,280 --> 01:35:18,478
Yeah, you have a hold on it, just
don't look at yourself in the mirror.

1526
01:35:18,560 --> 01:35:20,790
- Oh, stop it.
- Both of you.

1527
01:35:20,880 --> 01:35:24,350
- Don't overplay the lust.
- She's such a carnivore.

1528
01:35:27,840 --> 01:35:30,070
- Do you wanna have a drink?
- I'd love to.

1529
01:35:30,160 --> 01:35:31,513
Yeah? We'll talk.

1530
01:35:31,600 --> 01:35:33,318
Hi.

1531
01:35:33,400 --> 01:35:35,789
That was a... I just caught the end.

1532
01:35:35,880 --> 01:35:38,758
It seems like a terrific scene.
Great work.

1533
01:35:38,840 --> 01:35:42,196
- You didn't tell me you were coming.
- I was in the neighbourhood.

1534
01:35:42,280 --> 01:35:44,236
Thought I'd stop by.

1535
01:35:44,320 --> 01:35:47,357
- You know Greg.
- Sure. Good to see you.

1536
01:35:47,440 --> 01:35:51,831
- Going to Moran's around the corner.
- Did you wanna have that drink?

1537
01:35:51,920 --> 01:35:54,514
I thought maybe
we'll walk home together.

1538
01:35:54,600 --> 01:35:57,876
- I wanted to talk about the play.
- I thought you might wanna walk.

1539
01:35:57,960 --> 01:36:01,794
- I'm in the middle of rehearsals.
- I knew you'd be through by five.

1540
01:36:01,880 --> 01:36:03,632
What's the big deal?

1541
01:36:03,720 --> 01:36:07,633
I'm going to the bar.
We can easily talk tomorrow.

1542
01:36:09,400 --> 01:36:13,393
- You shouldn't crowd me like that.
- I just stopped by to pick you up.

1543
01:36:13,480 --> 01:36:15,630
- I thought you'd be glad.
- Things come up.

1544
01:36:15,720 --> 01:36:18,951
Something's wrong. I stop by to see
you and it puts you in a bad mood.

1545
01:36:19,040 --> 01:36:21,679
- You don't trust me!
- Should I trust you?

1546
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:23,478
You're so suspicious.

1547
01:36:23,560 --> 01:36:25,835
You wanna make it with the director.

1548
01:36:25,920 --> 01:36:28,992
I'm really not in the mood
for one of these long discussions.

1549
01:36:29,080 --> 01:36:32,117
- You said you were in love with me.
- You don't trust me.

1550
01:36:32,200 --> 01:36:35,431
How can I? Every time I turn my back
you're with somebody.

1551
01:36:35,520 --> 01:36:38,114
I told you,
I don't wanna be closed in.

1552
01:36:38,200 --> 01:36:42,830
- Then why are you living with me?
- I'm not, I just stay most nights.

1553
01:36:42,920 --> 01:36:47,277
- I don't wanna crowd you.
- Just let me go talk about the play.

1554
01:36:47,360 --> 01:36:51,319
Yeah, "Just fuck off so I can fuck
the director." That's cool.

1555
01:36:51,400 --> 01:36:54,233
I'm who I am.
I told you that when we met.

1556
01:36:54,320 --> 01:36:57,073
I always hope it's gonna be different
and it never is.

1557
01:36:57,160 --> 01:37:00,835
You love me and you're gonna be hurt
if I give up on you,

1558
01:37:00,920 --> 01:37:02,148
so think about it.

1559
01:37:02,240 --> 01:37:06,392
Just go home. We'll just enjoy
the time we have together.

1560
01:37:06,480 --> 01:37:08,710
We don't have to
complicate everything,

1561
01:37:08,800 --> 01:37:11,030
everything doesn't
have to be questioned.

1562
01:37:11,120 --> 01:37:14,590
You mean, "Will you get lost so I can
jump into bed with the director?"

1563
01:37:14,680 --> 01:37:18,275
Anyone listening to you would think
I was the Whore of TriBeCa.

1564
01:37:18,360 --> 01:37:22,478
If I said goodbye and never saw you
again, would that make you happy?

1565
01:37:22,560 --> 01:37:27,475
- That wouldn't make me happy.
- We have not made love in weeks.

1566
01:37:27,560 --> 01:37:30,836
Why do you want me when I just
lie there like a dead fish?

1567
01:37:30,920 --> 01:37:33,753
But you didn't used to.
What happened?

1568
01:37:33,840 --> 01:37:36,638
Nothing. It's me, OK?

1569
01:37:36,720 --> 01:37:42,352
It's me, and let's stay in tonight
and not overanalyse everything, OK?

1570
01:37:43,960 --> 01:37:46,110
Oh, what is it with these pills?

1571
01:37:46,200 --> 01:37:49,590
- They're diet pills.
- Oh, please! Just...

1572
01:37:56,080 --> 01:37:58,036
I just... I give up.

1573
01:37:58,120 --> 01:38:00,076
So...

1574
01:38:00,200 --> 01:38:03,670
So what do you want for dinner?
What should I buy?

1575
01:38:03,760 --> 01:38:05,796
Spaghetti.

1576
01:38:08,360 --> 01:38:10,510
I was gonna ask you to marry me.

1577
01:38:11,600 --> 01:38:13,909
No. Penne, with marinara.

1578
01:38:25,560 --> 01:38:29,872
Lee, right? Phil Datloff. Bonnie
brought you to dinner at my place.

1579
01:38:29,960 --> 01:38:32,520
Of course, I remember.
You were very kind.

1580
01:38:32,600 --> 01:38:35,990
I passed out on your carpet,
that I remember.

1581
01:38:36,080 --> 01:38:38,833
What happened to that book
you were toying with?

1582
01:38:38,920 --> 01:38:41,798
It just kind of floated away.

1583
01:38:41,880 --> 01:38:44,440
- I thought about it the other day.
- Really?

1584
01:38:44,520 --> 01:38:48,752
A culture that took a wrong turn, an
individual that can't find himself.

1585
01:38:48,840 --> 01:38:53,550
- That was it.
- Well, VJ Rajnipal, great writer,

1586
01:38:53,640 --> 01:38:57,235
he just gave us a fabulous manuscript
on the same subject.

1587
01:38:57,320 --> 01:38:58,548
Really?

1588
01:38:58,640 --> 01:39:00,915
A society where every member
is famous,

1589
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:02,956
there are no uncelebrated people.

1590
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:05,873
- Really?
- Yeah. Very hysterical. Brilliant.

1591
01:39:05,960 --> 01:39:08,713
I would like to have seen your take
on the same subject.

1592
01:39:08,800 --> 01:39:11,917
Oh, he's a great artist.
I could never...

1593
01:39:13,960 --> 01:39:16,758
- How is Bonnie?
- Oh, she's fine. Great girl.

1594
01:39:17,840 --> 01:39:20,274
I think she sold a screenplay.

1595
01:39:22,640 --> 01:39:27,475
Hi, we're at the star-spangled
première of The Liquidator.

1596
01:39:27,560 --> 01:39:31,269
Unfortunately for so many beautiful
people, the weather hasn't held up.

1597
01:39:31,360 --> 01:39:34,318
But the show must go on!
Here's the producer, Dalton Freed!

1598
01:39:34,400 --> 01:39:37,358
- Would you believe this weather?
- It's unbelievable!

1599
01:39:37,440 --> 01:39:40,238
- How are you doing?
- Well, could be better.

1600
01:39:40,320 --> 01:39:43,073
Hasn't kept people away.
Is this your wife?

1601
01:39:43,160 --> 01:39:46,630
This is a young actress
you're gonna hear a great deal about.

1602
01:39:46,720 --> 01:39:49,029
My wife, she's in rehab!

1603
01:39:49,120 --> 01:39:51,714
Well, I've read the reviews.
Very interesting!

1604
01:39:51,800 --> 01:39:54,712
- I never read reviews.
- What's your next project?

1605
01:39:54,800 --> 01:39:57,189
Birth Of A Nation,
an all-black version.

1606
01:39:57,280 --> 01:39:58,633
Great!

1607
01:39:58,720 --> 01:40:02,679
Oh, my gosh! Erno Delucca, who did
Nicole Oliver's wigs! How are you?

1608
01:40:02,760 --> 01:40:05,832
How are you?
I also did her werewolf makeup.

1609
01:40:05,920 --> 01:40:07,876
- Werewolf makeup?
- Yes, twice.

1610
01:40:07,960 --> 01:40:10,474
- Good job. Very nice to see you.
- Thank you.

1611
01:40:10,560 --> 01:40:14,951
We're expecting a lot of celebrities
tonight, I'm keeping my eyes peeled.

1612
01:40:15,040 --> 01:40:18,271
Here's the director! How are you?
What a night, huh?

1613
01:40:18,360 --> 01:40:21,670
It's incredible. Are you covering
this for The Weather Channel?

1614
01:40:21,760 --> 01:40:26,436
No, no. I understand that in your
film, you have a big rain sequence.

1615
01:40:26,520 --> 01:40:30,559
Yeah, we have amazing effects,
it's almost like the real thing.

1616
01:40:30,640 --> 01:40:32,392
It's better, actually.

1617
01:40:32,480 --> 01:40:34,994
Well, thanks so much.

1618
01:40:37,040 --> 01:40:39,076
Oh, Nicole Oliver! You're here!

1619
01:40:39,160 --> 01:40:41,720
The star of the movie,
and her husband!

1620
01:40:41,800 --> 01:40:44,394
You look beautiful.
Show us what you're wearing.

1621
01:40:44,480 --> 01:40:48,871
- I'm soaked.
- Unbelievable. You look fantastic!

1622
01:40:53,280 --> 01:40:57,319
It's unbelievable, and the rain
didn't seem to deter too many people.

1623
01:40:57,400 --> 01:40:59,868
It's a really exciting première.

1624
01:40:59,960 --> 01:41:04,158
Oh, my gosh! Robin!
Congratulations on your show,

1625
01:41:04,240 --> 01:41:06,800
your pregnancy,
your marriage, everything!

1626
01:41:06,880 --> 01:41:10,031
- Doesn't she look beautiful?
- Who knew angels flew so low?

1627
01:41:10,120 --> 01:41:14,079
Your show's just taken off,
I'm so jealous, you look so great!

1628
01:41:14,160 --> 01:41:17,311
- What do you think of this rain?
- It's really something.

1629
01:41:17,400 --> 01:41:19,550
Have a great time,
you look incredible!

1630
01:41:19,640 --> 01:41:23,713
Oh, look, we've got a lot more people
coming. Oh, I see Sandor!

1631
01:41:26,240 --> 01:41:28,754
We feel a little sorry for him.

1632
01:41:28,840 --> 01:41:30,910
Oh, my goodness!

1633
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:32,274
Lee!

1634
01:41:32,360 --> 01:41:34,590
Robin! I...

1635
01:41:34,680 --> 01:41:36,796
- What are you doing?
- Incredible.

1636
01:41:36,880 --> 01:41:40,919
I haven't seen you...
I saw you at the movies again.

1637
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:45,915
- This is my husband, Tony.
- Nice to meet you. Congratulations.

1638
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,639
Cos everything... You're transformed!

1639
01:41:48,720 --> 01:41:51,075
- This is such a surprise!
- What?

1640
01:41:51,160 --> 01:41:54,948
- This isn't your kind of movie.
- I interviewed Nicole Oliver.

1641
01:41:55,040 --> 01:41:57,554
I read that interview,
it was marvellous!

1642
01:41:57,640 --> 01:42:01,110
Marvellous? Did I hear what used
to be your least favourite word?

1643
01:42:01,200 --> 01:42:03,270
- Stop it!
- Those crossword puzzles.

1644
01:42:04,320 --> 01:42:06,390
- Shall I get some popcorn?
- Great.

1645
01:42:06,480 --> 01:42:10,268
- Can I get you a bag?
- That'd be great. I can't believe...

1646
01:42:11,360 --> 01:42:13,316
Have I become insufferable?

1647
01:42:13,400 --> 01:42:16,198
You look very happy.
Confident and radiant.

1648
01:42:16,280 --> 01:42:19,431
- Lee! How are you?
- Hi, Jack! How are you?

1649
01:42:19,520 --> 01:42:22,398
Robin Simon! I'm so excited
to see you in person!

1650
01:42:22,480 --> 01:42:24,436
- Oh, thank you!
- I love your show.

1651
01:42:24,520 --> 01:42:27,193
- You're a great broadcaster.
- Aren't you sweet?

1652
01:42:27,280 --> 01:42:29,999
- Listen, God bless you.
- God bless you.

1653
01:42:30,480 --> 01:42:32,675
You're so radiant.

1654
01:42:32,760 --> 01:42:35,433
Oh, thank you.
You know, it's luck, Lee.

1655
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:39,433
No matter what the shrinks or
the pundits or the books tell you.

1656
01:42:39,520 --> 01:42:41,829
When it comes to love, it's luck.

1657
01:42:41,920 --> 01:42:44,718
Well, I... I guess...

1658
01:42:46,840 --> 01:42:49,115
I'm glad you've been lucky.

1659
01:42:50,200 --> 01:42:53,112
- You with anyone?
- No, not at the moment.

1660
01:42:53,920 --> 01:42:55,956
- What are you working on?
- The same.

1661
01:42:56,040 --> 01:42:59,112
- A novel? A screenplay?
- Well, actually, I...

1662
01:42:59,200 --> 01:43:02,749
I did a huge interview at the old
actors' home, which was touching.

1663
01:43:02,840 --> 01:43:05,593
My Uncle Willie's here.
He asked about the autograph.

1664
01:43:05,680 --> 01:43:07,910
- Oh, God.
- We did a segment

1665
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,878
- from Charlie Manson's jail cell.
- So interesting.

1666
01:43:10,960 --> 01:43:13,679
We promised my nephew Ricky
an autograph.

1667
01:43:13,760 --> 01:43:16,433
- Oh, dear.
- Next time we're in California.

1668
01:43:17,120 --> 01:43:20,556
- There you go.
- Thanks. I don't wanna hold you up.

1669
01:43:20,640 --> 01:43:22,790
No, it's OK.

1670
01:43:22,880 --> 01:43:24,632
You know, it's really...

1671
01:43:24,720 --> 01:43:26,676
- Very nice to...
- Great to see you.

1672
01:43:26,760 --> 01:43:29,479
- Thank you.
- It really is great to see you.

1673
01:43:29,560 --> 01:43:31,516
Hope you catch a break.
