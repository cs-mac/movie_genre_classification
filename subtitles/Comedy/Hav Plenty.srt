Winners never quit,

2
00:02:14,324 --> 00:02:15,951
quitters never win.

3
00:02:16,193 --> 00:02:17,354
When the going gets tough,

4
00:02:17,528 --> 00:02:18,995
I kick ass...

5
00:02:19,999 --> 00:02:21,227
This is me!

6
00:02:23,169 --> 00:02:24,329
This is my country!

7
00:02:26,273 --> 00:02:28,002
These colours, my friend,

8
00:02:28,477 --> 00:02:30,172
these colours don't run!

9
00:02:55,078 --> 00:02:56,706

Paul Jeffries, USASF.

00:03:00,385 --> 00:03:03,822
I am at position one,
south west corner of the street...

12
00:03:05,192 --> 00:03:08,458
Situation here has become
increasingly difficult to monitor.

13
00:03:10,365 --> 00:03:12,197
Pedestrian population up,

14
00:03:12,635 --> 00:03:15,104
awareness level in retrograde.

15
00:03:16,874 --> 00:03:20,579
Less than twenty four hours after
the second anniversary of the attacks,

16
00:03:20,614 --> 00:03:23,481
and still on
a code yellow threat advisory.

17
00:03:25,553 --> 00:03:28,079
These people might
as well be picking flowers...

18
00:03:32,495 --> 00:03:34,191
Location secure.

00:04:00,465 --> 00:04:02,161
Thank you, God.

24
00:04:02,668 --> 00:04:04,830
Thank you for bringing me home!

25
00:04:05,205 --> 00:04:06,832
To my own country.

26
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:11,410
It feels so remote.
Been away for so long.

27
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:15,175
Thank you!

28

Two very shady personage,

43

having a conversation where they
know they can't be recorded.

44
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:36,259
Two boxes are being held.

45
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:38,595
And the label reads ah...

46
00:05:43,535 --> 00:05:44,594
Borax?

47
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,570
Two boxes of Borax.

48
00:05:50,946 --> 00:05:52,345

What is he,
a magician or something?

55
00:06:37,074 --> 00:06:39,305
Some kind of an invisible man?

56
00:06:46,953 --> 00:06:48,351
Suspect fled on foot,

57
00:06:48,386 --> 00:06:49,689

Talk about bad luck!

62

You think you slipped away?

63
00:07:11,753 --> 00:07:13,721
Maybe for now,
but not for long.

64
00:07:13,756 --> 00:07:15,658
You just ran into a
truck-load of the worst luck

Hi!

No, not really.

No? Good!

75
00:07:48,868 --> 00:07:51,667
Because I was a nerd back then

Uh, no! No, this is it.

Well, he might.

have to worry about e-mail.

I heard it from him,
alright, yeah.

Eighteen hundred hours,
El Monte airport.

myself excluded.

110
00:09:54,769 --> 00:09:59,104
I am observing approximately
forty to fifty private aircraft,

111
00:09:59,675 --> 00:10:02,236
secured with padlocks.

112
00:10:03,047 --> 00:10:04,810
Little kiddie locks!

113

My bicycle in high-school

Just one rat,

117
00:10:19,065 --> 00:10:21,962
Just one Mohamed Atta,
one Ziad Jarrah...

118
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:23,974
There are more homeless
and hungry

119
00:10:24,009 --> 00:10:27,274
in Los Angeles County than
anywhere else in the States.

120
00:10:29,015 --> 00:10:32,645
This is
"The hunger capital of America".

I just had no idea!

122
00:10:36,124 --> 00:10:39,194
I mean, the last thing that they're
talking about in the West Bank

123
00:10:39,229 --> 00:10:41,789
is poverty in America.

124
00:10:42,065 --> 00:10:45,036
The last thing they're
talking about in the West Wing

125
00:10:45,071 --> 00:10:46,664
is poverty in America.

126
00:10:48,675 --> 00:10:50,142
Is there no press?

127
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:52,675
No, it's all on Iraq.

128
00:10:53,213 --> 00:10:55,648
And if it wasn't that,
they'd just

129
00:10:55,817 --> 00:10:58,343
find something else to
spin in its place.

130
00:10:58,821 --> 00:11:00,813
Everyone buys it.

131
00:11:01,024 --> 00:11:03,016
One big lie after another...

132
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:21,973
We handed the tents
out a few weeks ago.

133
00:11:22,118 --> 00:11:23,085
Some wealthy woman

134
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,487
bought a hundred of them
and brought 'em down...

135
00:11:27,058 --> 00:11:30,722
I wish she'd come back
and bring some food.

136
00:11:31,465 --> 00:11:33,092
It's just too many!

137
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:37,004
We can't feed 'em all anymore.

138
00:11:39,809 --> 00:11:41,777
How far are we
from the mission?

139
00:11:42,112 --> 00:11:45,082

Oh, God! That lock!

148
00:12:23,133 --> 00:12:24,760
This is the men's dorm.

149
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:27,572
Most of the drug dealers
work the streets at night,

150
00:12:27,607 --> 00:12:29,975
so we lock them out and
go to bed kinda early...

151
00:12:31,411 --> 00:12:33,345
You're probably
beat anyway, huh?

152
00:12:35,216 --> 00:12:38,414
Yeah... (I'm) a little tired.

153
00:12:49,167 --> 00:12:50,134
Come on!

154
00:12:59,582 --> 00:13:01,140
Are you hungry?

155
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:02,851
No, not really.

156
00:13:02,886 --> 00:13:04,912
Good! You'll do well here.

157
00:13:18,941 --> 00:13:20,238
I like it.

158
00:13:21,077 --> 00:13:23,308
Huh! Sure you do.

159
00:13:24,248 --> 00:13:25,510
No, I really do.

160
00:13:26,617 --> 00:13:29,143
You are going to do
very well here.

161
00:13:31,223 --> 00:13:32,990
Bathroom is down the hall.

162
00:13:33,025 --> 00:13:35,360
And this key unlocks
your door,

163
00:13:35,395 --> 00:13:37,660
our kitchen,
and a few other things.

164
00:13:38,666 --> 00:13:40,999
It would be bad to lose it...

165
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:44,506
We usually have tea
around six.

166
00:13:45,175 --> 00:13:46,870
That sounds good.

167
00:13:48,647 --> 00:13:50,012
Okay.

168
00:13:53,654 --> 00:13:56,055
- Good Night!
- Good Night!

169
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:14,610
Deedee mau!

171
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:32,736
<i>That's it. Keep it coming...

172
00:14:32,771 --> 00:14:35,240

173
00:14:35,275 --> 00:14:38,074
<i>- Keep it coming! That's it.</i>
- Get the fuck out of my way!

174
00:14:38,446 --> 00:14:40,449
You're veering!
You're veering!

175
00:14:40,484 --> 00:14:42,042
Yeah, because of you!

176
00:14:42,385 --> 00:14:43,352
Watch the mirror!

177
00:14:43,553 --> 00:14:45,385
What would I do
without you, huh?

178
00:14:45,689 --> 00:14:48,488
There you go. You got it!

179
00:15:05,348 --> 00:15:07,550
More shredded paper? Great!

180
00:15:07,585 --> 00:15:09,753
Yeah, can you reassemble it?

181
00:15:10,689 --> 00:15:12,156
All of it?

182
00:15:13,459 --> 00:15:16,588
Piece of... piece of cake.

183
00:15:22,571 --> 00:15:24,267
Ah, you got some more water.

184
00:15:24,474 --> 00:15:25,409
Where is it from?

185
00:15:25,444 --> 00:15:26,535
Read it!

186
00:15:27,845 --> 00:15:29,437
What do you know about Borax?

187
00:15:29,648 --> 00:15:31,115
Borax?

188
00:15:31,316 --> 00:15:32,408
Yeah.

189
00:15:32,485 --> 00:15:35,723
It's a cleaning detergent,
isn't it?

190
00:15:35,758 --> 00:15:37,289
I know it's cleaning detergent!

191
00:15:37,324 --> 00:15:39,461
I wanna know what else
you can do with it.

192
00:15:39,496 --> 00:15:42,464
What do you mean,
like build a bomb?

193
00:15:42,499 --> 00:15:43,624
Just check it out.

194
00:15:43,832 --> 00:15:46,267
Alright.
I'll run it on the net.

195
00:15:47,304 --> 00:15:49,363
Hahaha!

196
00:15:52,177 --> 00:15:53,444
What?

197
00:15:53,479 --> 00:15:55,146
I was just thinking...

198
00:15:55,181 --> 00:15:57,751
You know, uh, everybody's
worried about a "dirty bomb".

199
00:15:57,786 --> 00:16:01,086
Wouldn't it be funny
if it was made out of Borax?

200
00:16:13,773 --> 00:16:17,142
Let me know as soon as you've
made it and we'll set up a chat time.

201
00:16:17,177 --> 00:16:21,550
I'm going to Abu Dis with the I.S.M.,
and yes, with Itzhak... ooh la la!

202
00:16:21,585 --> 00:16:23,819
for a "stop the wall" vigil,

203
00:16:23,854 --> 00:16:25,686
but I'm back tonight.
Miss you, Yael.

204
00:16:25,721 --> 00:16:28,657
P. S: If you're homesick,
check out the latest...

205
00:16:57,497 --> 00:17:02,835
Better Have Pains of Peace
Than Agonies of War

206
00:17:16,422 --> 00:17:23,593
I made it, but it was one of the
longest trips of my life.

207
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:28,716
When we chat
I'll tell you about LA.

208
00:17:28,751 --> 00:17:32,933
And you can tell me
about Itzhak!

209
00:17:33,378 --> 00:17:36,583
You're ten hours ahead of me,

210
00:17:36,618 --> 00:17:39,985
so how is ten your time,

211
00:17:40,355 --> 00:17:42,516
midnight for me tomorrow?

212
00:17:42,991 --> 00:17:46,861
I love you and
I miss you, Lana.

213
00:17:51,669 --> 00:17:53,672
<i>Ten-twenty.</i>

00:18:13,431 --> 00:18:14,592
Mom's letter.

216

God, help me deliver it
after all these years.

217
00:18:20,341 --> 00:18:22,309
Help me do this for her.

218
00:18:24,647 --> 00:18:26,639
Help me find my uncle...

219
00:18:27,717 --> 00:18:29,310
Wherever he is...

220
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:32,724
<i>... the strategy of the insurgents</i>
<i>in and around Baghdad

During the day

223
00:18:35,728 --> 00:18:37,598
the second floor is the
real hub of activity,

224
00:18:37,633 --> 00:18:40,634
so we usually leave
this door closed.

225
00:18:40,669 --> 00:18:41,700
Okay, got it.

226
00:18:41,735 --> 00:18:43,966
Those are the women's
dorms down there.

Martha's jurisdiction.

228
00:18:46,575 --> 00:18:47,443
How you're doing, Marth?

229
00:18:47,478 --> 00:18:48,672
Hi, Henry.

230
00:18:49,313 --> 00:18:51,046
You know, they've been
over capacity since,

231
00:18:51,081 --> 00:18:54,083
well, since the last time the
fire marshal was here.

232
00:18:54,118 --> 00:18:58,352
And we have a small room for
reading and prayer in there.

233
00:18:59,592 --> 00:19:00,359
And down here...

234
00:19:00,394 --> 00:19:02,658
- Ooh, I am sorry!
- Wow! Excuse me!

235
00:19:02,864 --> 00:19:04,491
...and come down here.

236
00:19:05,033 --> 00:19:06,695
This is my office.

237
00:19:08,706 --> 00:19:11,574
And then, the real action
is in here!

238
00:19:19,386 --> 00:19:20,877
Cafe Maison.

239
00:19:23,792 --> 00:19:25,494
How's it flowing, Big H?

240
00:19:25,529 --> 00:19:26,620
Oh, good.

241
00:19:26,862 --> 00:19:28,660
- Sherman.
- Yes.

242
00:19:28,965 --> 00:19:30,066
This is Lana.

243
00:19:30,101 --> 00:19:31,398
Hi.

00:19:31,802 --> 00:19:33,702
Welcome to the mad house!

245
00:19:33,704 --> 00:19:35,674
- Thank you.
- Help yourselves, fellows...

246
00:19:35,709 --> 00:19:38,007
Sherman is our
operational manager.

247
00:19:38,644 --> 00:19:41,782
And the chef.
And the janitor.

248
00:19:41,817 --> 00:19:43,341
And the accountant.

253

<i>Sir, I didn't ask you</i>

<i>I asked you if</i>

00:19:58,807 --> 00:20:00,706
<i>should we always have</i>
<i>the approval of

00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:02,961
<i>the United Nations before</i>
<i>sending troops in?

257
00:20:02,996 --> 00:20:05,180
<i>Please just answer that</i>

258
00:20:05,215 --> 00:20:06,481
<i>Absolutely

<i>Okay, thank you, Sir.

260
00:20:07,216 --> 00:20:10,520
<i>And for the record: Let me tell you:</i>
<i>You're a full-blown and complete idiot.

261
00:20:10,555 --> 00:20:11,887
<i>But: God bless you</i>

Afternoon. This your van?

265
00:21:36,269 --> 00:21:39,898
Yeah. Yeah, I like a little shade.

266
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:41,589
You PD?

267
00:21:41,624 --> 00:21:42,640
Nope.

268
00:21:42,943 --> 00:21:45,811
But I was on a freedom
bird with one of your LTs.

You're working UC?!

272
00:21:57,062 --> 00:21:58,552
I'm working...

273
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:08,756
Ah, excuse me, uh,
good morning,

274
00:22:08,791 --> 00:22:10,938
good afternoon,
whatever, but, uh,

275
00:22:11,081 --> 00:22:12,742
can I help you?

276
00:22:13,284 --> 00:22:15,653
Hi. I am looking for
my uncle and,

277
00:22:15,688 --> 00:22:17,154
and I have this address...

278
00:22:17,189 --> 00:22:20,260
Your uncle?
Oh, you got the wrong house.

279
00:22:20,295 --> 00:22:22,286
Paul... his name is
Paul Jeffries?

280
00:22:22,797 --> 00:22:26,096
No, no, no,
never heard of him. No!

281
00:22:35,212 --> 00:22:36,614
I've been overseas
for a long time

282
00:22:36,649 --> 00:22:38,367
and I just
got back into town.

283
00:22:38,402 --> 00:22:40,990
And I'd really
like to see him.

284
00:22:41,025 --> 00:22:43,579
I, I kind of need to actually.

285
00:22:43,824 --> 00:22:46,988
But the guy that lives here
doesn't have any relatives.

286
00:22:47,095 --> 00:22:51,591
Well, uh, he does.
He has one. It's me.

287
00:22:54,005 --> 00:22:55,304
Yeah, I was chubby.

288
00:22:55,339 --> 00:22:58,400
Um, so is there a way that
I can get in touch with him?

289
00:22:58,911 --> 00:23:01,782
Cause I'm staying at a homeless
mission right now and I just...

290
00:23:01,817 --> 00:23:03,272
I don't have a phone.

291
00:23:07,055 --> 00:23:08,421
Um...

292
00:23:15,132 --> 00:23:17,294
Look, you didn't, uh...

293
00:23:18,169 --> 00:23:22,073
you didn't get this... get this from me.
Right? Some little birdie told you...

294
00:23:30,219 --> 00:23:33,986
Nineteen hundred hours,
evidence secured.

295
00:23:34,291 --> 00:23:36,089
Will transport water samples

296
00:23:36,227 --> 00:23:41,188
and report botulinim toxin analysis
as soon as it gets back from the lab.

297
00:23:43,804 --> 00:23:45,033
Jeffries, out.

298
00:23:56,454 --> 00:23:58,046
I'm good!

299
00:24:17,081 --> 00:24:17,945
Damned!

300
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:40,110
<i>So if I see someone actively</i>

301
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:44,217

<i>well I'm not just going to walk away.

302

303
00:24:48,274 --> 00:24:52,227
<i>I'm going to take a closer look!</i>
<i>I don't think it's radical.

304
00:24:52,262 --> 00:24:54,025

Bread of Life?

307
00:25:22,101 --> 00:25:24,968
<i>Yeah, is that not what</i>
<i>I'm supposed to say?

308
00:25:25,638 --> 00:25:27,374
How would I know?

309
00:25:27,409 --> 00:25:29,074
Well, I don't know.

310
00:25:29,109 --> 00:25:31,492
What did they say the
last time you called?

311
00:25:31,527 --> 00:25:33,875
Well, to tell you the truth,
I don't remember.

312
00:25:34,985 --> 00:25:38,444
<i>Uh, well, this is the hall phone.</i>
<i>And I'm Lana.

313

314

Lana Swenson.

315
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:54,310
What're your hours down there,
Miss Swenson?

316
00:25:54,345 --> 00:25:56,697
- Your hours of operation?
- Well, uh,

317
00:25:56,732 --> 00:25:59,015
the food service
and the sermons vary,

318
00:25:59,050 --> 00:26:02,418
but the mission is pretty much
open all the time.

319
00:26:03,322 --> 00:26:04,517
<i>Is that right?

320
00:26:04,625 --> 00:26:05,887
Yeah.

00:26:10,231 --> 00:26:12,257
I remember you, you know.

323
00:26:12,534 --> 00:26:16,106
And, uh, and I really
wanna see you again,

324
00:26:16,141 --> 00:26:17,207
<i>Uncle Paul, even if...

325
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:18,474
Listen, um,

326
00:26:18,509 --> 00:26:20,510
I needed some information, okay?

327
00:26:20,545 --> 00:26:22,880
And... you helped me out,
I appreciate that.

328
00:26:22,915 --> 00:26:25,885
If I can ever do anything for you,
let me know...

329
00:26:27,288 --> 00:26:28,380
Fuck!

330
00:26:59,596 --> 00:27:01,164
We went to the wall today,

331
00:27:01,199 --> 00:27:03,035
they shot rubber bullets
and some tear gas,

332
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:05,269
but no one was hurt.
And get this:

333
00:27:05,304 --> 00:27:07,207
there were nearly as
many Israelis protesting

334
00:27:07,242 --> 00:27:09,233
the wall as there
we're Palestinians!

335
00:27:09,477 --> 00:27:11,946
Now that sounds promising!

336
00:27:12,681 --> 00:27:16,277
I wish there was more
awareness here.

337
00:27:16,353 --> 00:27:19,050
A lot of people don't
even know it's happening.

338
00:27:23,096 --> 00:27:25,360
Which is why you're going to
become a writer!

339
00:27:25,631 --> 00:27:28,302
Why be just one more person trying
to change the world when you can

340
00:27:28,337 --> 00:27:30,635
write something that
will cause a 1000 to try!!!

341
00:27:31,139 --> 00:27:34,828
Have you heard
anything from my...

342
00:27:34,863 --> 00:27:38,481
And before you change
the subject,

343
00:27:38,516 --> 00:27:41,451
I saw your Dad yesterday
and he's totally fine.

344
00:27:41,786 --> 00:27:43,305
He's back to his
old cranky self,

345
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:44,788
running the mission
like a general,

346
00:27:44,823 --> 00:27:47,159
and (I'm not supposed to
tell you this part)

347
00:27:47,194 --> 00:27:49,495
calling Henry every day
to see how you're doing.

348
00:27:52,401 --> 00:27:55,428
Thanks for the update.

349
00:27:56,305 --> 00:28:03,441
You have no idea how good
it is to hear that.

350
00:28:03,582 --> 00:28:08,282
And how about
"ooh la la" Itzhak?

351
00:28:09,323 --> 00:28:11,622
Itzhak who?
I've never heard of him.

352
00:28:13,862 --> 00:28:16,730
Okay. Yish-mor-cha Eha-el...
love, Yael.

353
00:28:20,072 --> 00:28:23,099
God bless you too, Lana.

354
00:28:29,516 --> 00:28:30,448
Aah!

355
00:28:33,688 --> 00:28:36,715
Aah! Mmmh!

356
00:28:40,498 --> 00:28:42,295
What's the matter, Jeffries?

357
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,460
Napalm getting' to you?

358
00:28:45,505 --> 00:28:49,101
Somebody get Polly here an APC
for his god-damn menstrual cramps.

359
00:28:50,211 --> 00:28:52,510
Don't you get sick on
me now, Jeffries!

360
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:57,416
Charlie's not sick hiding in
that rat-hole.

361
00:28:58,822 --> 00:29:00,356
There wasn't anybody sick

362
00:29:00,391 --> 00:29:03,486
in Boston on September tenth,
I can guarantee that...

363
00:29:04,396 --> 00:29:06,331
In Washington and Newark...

364
00:29:06,533 --> 00:29:09,094
they weren't sick and tired.
They were preparing,

365
00:29:10,337 --> 00:29:11,430
god damn it!

366
00:29:14,476 --> 00:29:17,412
Go ahead and laugh,
you fucking cowards!

367
00:29:18,181 --> 00:29:19,615
Come on, laugh,

368
00:29:19,650 --> 00:29:22,814
you fucking,
lousy fucking Chuck!

369
00:29:23,321 --> 00:29:25,552
You pull a box cutter on me,
motherfucker!

370
00:29:25,958 --> 00:29:27,892
We'll see what happens...

371
00:29:32,667 --> 00:29:34,898
Just one of those planes!

372
00:29:36,473 --> 00:29:38,668
If I had just been
on one of 'em!

373
00:29:41,579 --> 00:29:43,605
Where the hell was everybody?

374
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:51,386
This country's been good to me...

375
00:29:52,661 --> 00:29:54,357
This beautiful country...

376
00:30:03,274 --> 00:30:04,400
Oh God!

377
00:30:17,227 --> 00:30:21,255
grateful to you...

378
00:30:25,271 --> 00:30:27,364
You know how scared I am.

379
00:30:30,578 --> 00:30:32,409
I'm way out of my depths here.

380
00:30:32,647 --> 00:30:35,742
Yesterday I was still in the
West Bank, and then...

381
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,954
all of a sudden I'm here,

382
00:30:40,757 --> 00:30:42,885
in my own country, but it

383
00:30:43,694 --> 00:30:45,560
feels so strange.

384
00:30:46,865 --> 00:30:49,664
You gotta back me up on
this one, God,

385
00:30:49,736 --> 00:30:51,671
even if I'm wrong.

386
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,872
I know that I need help.

387
00:30:55,043 --> 00:30:57,546
I know that I can't
do it on my own.

388
00:30:57,581 --> 00:30:59,344
Do WHAT on my own?

389
00:30:59,583 --> 00:31:02,678
I don't even know why
I'm here, in America.

390
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:04,622
To deliver a letter?

391
00:31:04,657 --> 00:31:08,295
There must be more to it,
it's not just for Mom...

392
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:10,594
I don't have to be afraid.

393
00:31:11,098 --> 00:31:13,267
I know that you're with me.

394
00:31:13,302 --> 00:31:15,600
And I know that
you're always there,

395
00:31:18,574 --> 00:31:21,442
with your arms
stretched out wide.

396
00:31:21,813 --> 00:31:23,644
Thank you, God!

397
00:31:26,751 --> 00:31:29,084
Thank you for this day,

398
00:31:29,922 --> 00:31:31,891
for this room,

399
00:31:33,561 --> 00:31:35,654
for my life. Thank you!

400
00:31:41,438 --> 00:31:43,407
Oh, falling! We're falling!

401
00:32:15,717 --> 00:32:17,617
Hey, how is it going?

402
00:32:21,692 --> 00:32:23,626
Maybe we'll talk later.

403
00:32:26,731 --> 00:32:28,825
Hey, how're you doing?

404
00:32:29,068 --> 00:32:30,582
What, you serve me
a couple of meals

405
00:32:30,617 --> 00:32:32,096
and now we're supposed
to be friends?

406
00:32:32,707 --> 00:32:34,538
Oh, come on.
Sure, why not?

407
00:32:34,809 --> 00:32:36,710
But you don't even
know my name!

408
00:32:36,845 --> 00:32:39,371
What, is that one of the
rules of friendship?

409
00:32:39,716 --> 00:32:43,050
How can you be someone's friend
when you don't know what to call them?

410
00:32:45,223 --> 00:32:49,160
Well, I mean, I don't know,
but I bet you there's a way.

411
00:32:51,999 --> 00:32:54,559
Oh, Charles!
Is this your drink?

412
00:32:58,206 --> 00:32:59,731
What's so funny?

413
00:32:59,942 --> 00:33:02,879
Nothing. But you're standing
there with your foot in your mouth.

414
00:33:02,914 --> 00:33:05,178
So she knows my name.
Big deal.

415
00:33:05,983 --> 00:33:07,417
Charles...

416
00:33:09,789 --> 00:33:11,691
- Hey, how you're doing?
- How you're doing?

417
00:33:11,726 --> 00:33:13,717
- I'm good.
- They call me Dee Dee.

418
00:33:13,928 --> 00:33:16,598
Dee Dee, it's nice to meet you.
I'm Lana.

419
00:33:16,633 --> 00:33:17,997
Nice to meet you, too.

420
00:33:18,468 --> 00:33:19,902
You got some meat in there?

421
00:33:19,937 --> 00:33:21,670
Right. There.

422
00:33:21,705 --> 00:33:22,673
Thank you, thank you.

423
00:33:22,708 --> 00:33:23,799
That's good.

424
00:33:47,806 --> 00:33:52,609
This is no coincidence,
this is a sign! Yeah.

425
00:33:52,913 --> 00:33:58,251
Or maybe... instinct.
Maybe is just pure instinct.

426
00:33:59,955 --> 00:34:01,656
Thirteen-twenty six.

427
00:34:01,691 --> 00:34:04,829
Suspect relocated:
Bread of Life Mission.

428
00:34:04,864 --> 00:34:07,492
Still inside.
I remain in position.

429
00:34:12,139 --> 00:34:15,871
I got all day, pal.
You take your time in there.

430
00:34:15,977 --> 00:34:17,706
Enjoy that sandwich!

431
00:34:17,914 --> 00:34:19,882
Because that sandwich
is gonna cost you.

432
00:34:19,917 --> 00:34:21,852
There's no free lunch
in this country.

433
00:34:21,887 --> 00:34:23,114
I'm Lana.

434
00:34:23,821 --> 00:34:25,048
I'm Hassan.

435
00:34:27,158 --> 00:34:29,092
Where are you from?

436
00:34:32,165 --> 00:34:35,897
My home is not a place,
it is people.

437
00:34:46,851 --> 00:34:48,079
Okay. Here we go...

438
00:34:51,959 --> 00:34:54,861
Thirteen-forty eight.
Suspect engaged,

439
00:34:54,896 --> 00:34:57,063
standing on the northwest
corner of Winston

440
00:34:57,098 --> 00:35:00,900
and Los Angeles Street.
Under full surveillance!

441
00:35:02,138 --> 00:35:03,868
Lead the way,
my little Pied Piper!

442
00:35:04,942 --> 00:35:06,137
Lead the way...

443
00:35:12,185 --> 00:35:13,986
Oh, he's got
some more borax, huh?

444
00:35:14,021 --> 00:35:15,788
You got a lot of laundry,
don't you?

445
00:35:16,357 --> 00:35:18,952
So, you've ever been
on a camel?

446
00:35:20,061 --> 00:35:21,324
What?

447
00:35:22,431 --> 00:35:24,832
In Palestine, or wherever...

448
00:35:25,035 --> 00:35:28,939
Uh, no. No,
they have cars now.

449
00:35:29,074 --> 00:35:31,133
That's where you're from, right?

450
00:35:31,745 --> 00:35:33,311
Well, for the last
couple of years.

451
00:35:33,346 --> 00:35:37,283
I was born in Ohio,
but I grew up mostly in Africa.

452
00:35:38,954 --> 00:35:39,978
In Africa?

453
00:35:40,990 --> 00:35:42,787
Yeah. My dad's a missionary.

454
00:35:43,026 --> 00:35:47,829
Oh! So, you've ever
been on an elephant?

455
00:36:00,783 --> 00:36:02,751
Suspect entered...

456
00:36:08,159 --> 00:36:12,097
the Nidal Chemical
Bleaching Company,

457
00:36:14,133 --> 00:36:17,001
at six four five
Imperial Street.

458
00:36:22,879 --> 00:36:26,316
That's an awful lot of barbed
wire for a bleaching company...

459
00:36:31,256 --> 00:36:32,690
Bleaching!

460
00:36:33,927 --> 00:36:35,088
Chemicals!

461
00:36:39,034 --> 00:36:40,058
Hey, Boss.

462
00:36:40,135 --> 00:36:42,187
<i>So, what'd you find out</i>
<i>for me on Borax?

463
00:36:42,222 --> 00:36:44,240
Didn't you get the information
I printed out for you?

464
00:36:44,275 --> 00:36:46,732
I put it in the envelope
next to your seat.

465
00:36:48,112 --> 00:36:49,842
I haven't had time.

466
00:36:50,115 --> 00:36:52,812
You know those printer cartridges
just aren't cheap!

467
00:36:54,521 --> 00:36:56,254
I got one report
out of Trinidad.

468
00:36:56,289 --> 00:36:58,725
There's an Islamic military
group there,

469
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:02,264
and they're threatening attacks
on the UK and The States.

470
00:37:02,299 --> 00:37:03,527
Chemical attacks!

471
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:04,899
And?

472
00:37:04,934 --> 00:37:09,941
<i>And, wow, wow, well, they're playing</i>
<i>around with a lot of stuff. Cobalt,

473
00:37:09,976 --> 00:37:13,275
cobalt sulphate,
but they're using, uh...

474
00:37:13,513 --> 00:37:17,118
they're using Borax.
Borax is definitely part of the mix!

475
00:37:17,153 --> 00:37:17,884
<i>Is that right?

476
00:37:17,919 --> 00:37:20,790
Yeah, but I don't know if they use it
or if they're boiling it down

477
00:37:20,825 --> 00:37:22,022
for boron acid or what.

478
00:37:22,057 --> 00:37:24,560
You know there's
four different kinds of boron.

479
00:37:24,595 --> 00:37:27,214
Pentahydrate boron,
dexahydrate boron,

480
00:37:27,249 --> 00:37:29,834
anhydrous sodium
sulphate boron and...

481
00:37:29,869 --> 00:37:31,068
Good! Good work, Jimmy.

482
00:37:31,103 --> 00:37:32,604
- I'll get back to you.
<i>- And... and...

483
00:37:32,639 --> 00:37:35,438
and there is one other
kind of boron...

484
00:37:38,112 --> 00:37:41,105
yeah. Serge?

485
00:38:06,283 --> 00:38:08,253
<i>... if anything sounds</i>
<i>fishy to you

486
00:38:08,288 --> 00:38:09,952
<i>about a four-star general

487
00:38:09,987 --> 00:38:11,922
<i>who doesn't believe in the</i>
<i>right to bear arms.

488
00:38:11,957 --> 00:38:14,894
- You're a busy little fellow, aren't ya!
<i>- I don't really care about Clark's politics,

489
00:38:14,929 --> 00:38:16,564
<i>- I really don't,</i>
- Yeah, and I'm on you like glue.

490
00:38:16,599 --> 00:38:18,198
<i>but I think this man</i>
<i>should see a psychiatrist!

491
00:38:18,233 --> 00:38:19,566
Do we need the wars,

492
00:38:19,601 --> 00:38:24,073
and the killing and the exploitation
of man by his fellow man?

493
00:38:24,108 --> 00:38:28,177
Does God favour some people,

494
00:38:28,212 --> 00:38:29,912
so he makes them
rich and powerful,

495
00:38:29,947 --> 00:38:33,076
and we're the ones who have
fallen out of grace?

496
00:38:35,521 --> 00:38:37,456
I wanna tell you right now, uh,

497
00:38:37,691 --> 00:38:40,217
I have some very good reasons
not to think so.

498
00:38:41,997 --> 00:38:44,228
Cause when Christ
lived with us,

499
00:38:45,269 --> 00:38:48,171
and he walked among us,

500
00:38:48,306 --> 00:38:50,171
he preferred your company!

501
00:38:51,644 --> 00:38:55,913
He would rather
stay with the outcasts

502
00:38:55,948 --> 00:39:00,087
and the whores and the underprivileged
than the rich and the hypocrites.

503
00:39:00,122 --> 00:39:02,625
In fact, when he sat
at the table of the wealthy,

504
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:05,128
he couldn't even take it.
It was an insult to him!

505
00:39:05,163 --> 00:39:07,096
And that is where...

506
00:39:07,330 --> 00:39:11,291
he told that story of
a certain beggar,

507
00:39:11,403 --> 00:39:13,565
a man called Lazarus,

508
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:16,209
who was on his knees at the...

509
00:39:16,443 --> 00:39:20,210
at the gates of a mansion,
covered in sores,

510
00:39:20,481 --> 00:39:24,386
asking for the crumbs that fell
from a rich man's table.

511
00:39:24,421 --> 00:39:28,222
This beggar was treated worse
than that man's dogs.

512
00:39:28,326 --> 00:39:31,922
But after his death
he wasn't forgotten...

513
00:40:04,674 --> 00:40:07,378
I know I'm missing critical
information right here!

514
00:40:07,413 --> 00:40:09,972
Goddamn it! I can sense it!

515
00:40:29,272 --> 00:40:30,706
Holy shit!!

516
00:40:52,637 --> 00:40:54,037
Bring him over here!

517
00:40:55,474 --> 00:40:56,464
Right here, come on!

518
00:40:57,210 --> 00:40:58,177
Come on!

519
00:40:58,411 --> 00:41:00,277
Hold on now!
Hold on, my brother!

520
00:41:00,581 --> 00:41:02,675
Come on! Let's go,
put him right there.

521
00:41:03,085 --> 00:41:04,052
Hold on!

522
00:41:05,455 --> 00:41:06,183
Hold on!

523
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:09,051
Sherman, call an ambulance!
Ann!

524
00:41:09,293 --> 00:41:10,659
Oh, Lord, help us!

525
00:41:10,694 --> 00:41:13,664
Ann, get me a towel, a bunch
of them. And water!

526
00:41:14,499 --> 00:41:17,765
- Hold on, my brother! Hold on!
- Hollow point forty-four.

527
00:41:19,372 --> 00:41:20,498
What?

528
00:41:20,574 --> 00:41:22,873
The bullet explodes on impact.
It's, uh...

529
00:41:23,277 --> 00:41:24,411
tears a big hole in you.

530
00:41:24,446 --> 00:41:26,573
So, what do we do? You know CPR?
Come on!

531
00:41:27,684 --> 00:41:29,812
- Ambulance is on the way!
- Good.

532
00:41:30,855 --> 00:41:33,824
Save me! Save me!

533
00:41:33,859 --> 00:41:36,327
Tell me who it was.
Anything you can tell...

534
00:41:36,362 --> 00:41:38,532
Just give me a name.
Just give me a name! Any name!

535
00:41:38,567 --> 00:41:40,433
Trona... Trona.

536
00:41:40,468 --> 00:41:42,301
Trona? Okay.

537
00:41:55,621 --> 00:41:57,316
What did he say?

538
00:42:05,834 --> 00:42:07,826
Is he going to make it?

539
00:42:08,971 --> 00:42:10,405
No.

540
00:42:11,441 --> 00:42:13,171
What happened?

541
00:42:13,511 --> 00:42:15,241
It was a drive-by.

542
00:42:18,785 --> 00:42:20,776
You look a lot
like your mother.

543
00:42:20,988 --> 00:42:22,250
What?

544
00:42:22,490 --> 00:42:23,924
Especially your eyes.

545
00:42:25,427 --> 00:42:27,163
On my bed, at night
I remember you.

546
00:42:27,198 --> 00:42:28,863
- And I think of you through
- Paul!

547
00:42:28,898 --> 00:42:31,231
the watches of the night
because you are my help.

548
00:42:31,535 --> 00:42:34,596
I sing in the
shadow of your wings.

549
00:42:35,641 --> 00:42:39,543
My soul clings to you.
Your right hand upholds me.

550
00:42:41,682 --> 00:42:43,952
Holy father, accept this soul into
heaven with all your divine

551
00:42:43,987 --> 00:42:47,411
mercy and love, amen.

552
00:43:13,958 --> 00:43:15,654
Who's that man, Lana?

553
00:44:22,916 --> 00:44:26,752
Perpetrators approached
the kerb in a black Humvee

554
00:44:26,922 --> 00:44:29,391
at twenty-two hundred
and twenty hours.

555
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:32,754
Conversation with the
victim was un-recordable.

556
00:44:33,130 --> 00:44:36,634
However, within the Hummer,
I identified laughter.

557
00:44:36,669 --> 00:44:38,125
Authentic laughter!

558
00:44:40,874 --> 00:44:42,603
That's not CIA.

559
00:44:45,012 --> 00:44:46,776
It's definitely not DHS.

560
00:44:46,982 --> 00:44:48,643
That's a negative!

561
00:44:49,886 --> 00:44:51,521
They wanted to make a statement,

562
00:44:51,556 --> 00:44:53,156
but not too big of a statement.

563
00:45:04,772 --> 00:45:07,401
A hundred and twenty thousand
dollar vehicle!

564
00:45:07,742 --> 00:45:09,445
Now where'd that
money come from?

565
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:12,176
Saudi Arabia? Pasadena?

566
00:45:13,116 --> 00:45:14,914
Either way, it's an Op.

567
00:45:15,219 --> 00:45:19,020
A small, elite cell that
was gonna start some trouble,

568
00:45:19,591 --> 00:45:21,492
that was gonna
screw something up.

569
00:45:21,895 --> 00:45:23,863
They didn't wanna
work for Al Quaeda

570
00:45:23,898 --> 00:45:26,663
or Jemaah Islamiyah
or whatever the hell,

571
00:45:26,868 --> 00:45:29,133
so the big boys had to
send them a message.

572
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:33,675
Yeah. But the big question is:

573
00:45:33,744 --> 00:45:38,012
what is the big plan that
the small plan was gonna screw up?

574
00:45:54,805 --> 00:45:58,970
That laughter sounded Arabic.
Definitely Arabic.

575
00:46:53,216 --> 00:46:54,275
Damn it!

576
00:47:00,626 --> 00:47:01,559
What?!

577
00:47:01,594 --> 00:47:03,529
<i>Paul, it's Lana.

578
00:47:03,830 --> 00:47:05,822
Congratulations!
What do you want?

579
00:47:06,134 --> 00:47:08,262
<i>I wanna ask you a question.

580
00:47:08,737 --> 00:47:10,136
Well, now is not a good time.

581
00:47:10,171 --> 00:47:12,808
<i>You shouldn't be even using</i>
<i>this phone! It's for emergencies!

582
00:47:12,843 --> 00:47:14,640
Who's Trona?

583
00:47:15,011 --> 00:47:15,943
What'd you say?

584
00:47:16,714 --> 00:47:18,816
Trona. I heard what that
man said to you.

585
00:47:18,851 --> 00:47:20,341
He said "Trona".

586
00:47:20,852 --> 00:47:23,219
<i>I just wanna help.</i>
<i>That's why I'm asking.

587
00:47:23,823 --> 00:47:26,258
Listen, there is a lot more to
this than you think there is.

588
00:47:26,727 --> 00:47:28,363
I met him in the
food line today

589
00:47:28,398 --> 00:47:30,297
and he told me his name.

590
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:31,299
<i>Hassan...

591
00:47:31,334 --> 00:47:33,199
Don't say anything else.

592
00:47:33,637 --> 00:47:35,332
This is not a secure line,
alright?

593
00:47:35,706 --> 00:47:37,038
I'll come to see you tomorrow.

594
00:48:01,806 --> 00:48:03,399
Time to make the donuts!

595
00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:10,308
Hi! Now this is critically
important. Are you with me?

596
00:48:10,686 --> 00:48:11,653
Yeah!

597
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:13,046
Okay.

598
00:48:13,222 --> 00:48:14,622
Number one.

599
00:48:16,193 --> 00:48:17,125
Crime scene?

600
00:48:17,328 --> 00:48:18,160
I'll explain it later.

601
00:48:18,195 --> 00:48:19,796
But I need you to make a
dub of this tape

602
00:48:19,831 --> 00:48:23,165
and deliver to all four local
networks by o-nine hundred.

603
00:48:23,336 --> 00:48:24,703
Can you handle that?

604
00:48:24,738 --> 00:48:25,939
Of course, I can handle it.

605
00:48:25,974 --> 00:48:26,963
Alright.

606
00:48:27,909 --> 00:48:31,937
And then have this Arabic document
translated and analysed AS AP!

607
00:48:32,181 --> 00:48:34,151
I will do. Consider it done.

608
00:48:34,186 --> 00:48:35,413
Good.

609
00:48:36,988 --> 00:48:38,649
By o-nine hundred!

610
00:48:39,058 --> 00:48:41,292
- O-nine hundred.
- I want you all to listen to this again: Neither

611
00:48:41,327 --> 00:48:41,759
death, nor life, nor rulers,
nor powers

612
00:48:42,161 --> 00:48:47,863
death, nor life, nor rulers,
nor powers

613
00:48:48,936 --> 00:48:51,239
will separate you and
me from the love of God.

614
00:48:51,274 --> 00:48:53,174
You are loved!

615
00:48:56,213 --> 00:48:59,308
When you're asleep out
there in the streets,

616
00:49:00,985 --> 00:49:02,681
you are loved!

617
00:49:04,891 --> 00:49:08,828
When you're collecting cans for
a nickel each, you are loved!

618
00:49:21,981 --> 00:49:23,778
Oh, wow!

619
00:49:25,418 --> 00:49:29,089
Is this, uh... is this like
your surveillance vehicle?

620
00:49:29,124 --> 00:49:30,387
It's one of them, yeah.

621
00:49:33,162 --> 00:49:34,789
Up, I got it.

622
00:49:35,866 --> 00:49:38,768
Thanks. Stand by...

623
00:49:42,808 --> 00:49:45,145
September fifteen,
eleven hundred o-six,

624
00:49:45,180 --> 00:49:47,080
Paul Jeffries, USASF.

625
00:49:47,948 --> 00:49:49,848
Update on the situation:

626
00:49:50,185 --> 00:49:53,019
individual identified as Hassan.

627
00:49:53,389 --> 00:49:54,981
Was that his first name?

628
00:49:56,860 --> 00:49:58,259
First name Hassan...

629
00:49:59,497 --> 00:50:00,899
You know his last name?

630
00:50:00,934 --> 00:50:02,026
No.

631
00:50:02,802 --> 00:50:07,468
Further investigation needs to be
conducted before determining last name.

632
00:50:08,309 --> 00:50:11,437
Okay. So, when you
had this situation...

633
00:50:12,213 --> 00:50:13,875
this dialogue,

634
00:50:14,183 --> 00:50:16,277
do you remember exactly
what was said?

635
00:50:16,486 --> 00:50:17,578
Yeah.

636
00:50:17,954 --> 00:50:20,191
Okay, good. So, just start
from the beginning.

637
00:50:20,226 --> 00:50:22,192
Tell me word for word.

638
00:50:22,227 --> 00:50:23,990
- It's very important.
- Okay.

639
00:50:26,265 --> 00:50:30,135
Um... I said "hello",
and then he said "hello".

640
00:50:30,538 --> 00:50:34,510
Then I said "I'm Lana",
he said "I'm Hassan"...

641
00:50:34,545 --> 00:50:36,747
And then I asked him
where he was from,

642
00:50:36,782 --> 00:50:38,950
because he looked
middle eastern...

643
00:50:38,985 --> 00:50:39,949
What did he say to that?

644
00:50:39,984 --> 00:50:42,886
He said "My home is not a place,
it is people".

645
00:50:47,628 --> 00:50:49,289
What the hell does that mean?

646
00:50:51,933 --> 00:50:54,129
I mean, I don't really know.

647
00:50:54,936 --> 00:50:55,970
That was it?

648
00:50:56,005 --> 00:50:59,339
Yeah, yeah. Then he took his
food and he walked away.

649
00:51:05,551 --> 00:51:11,287
My home is not a place,
it is people...

650
00:51:12,995 --> 00:51:16,363
That means: his home...

651
00:51:20,337 --> 00:51:21,930
is people.

652
00:51:26,078 --> 00:51:27,637
Something like that. Okay!

653
00:51:28,048 --> 00:51:29,584
Is this for the Agent Orange?

654
00:51:29,619 --> 00:51:30,915
What?

655
00:51:31,252 --> 00:51:33,388
Mom told me that
when you were in Vietnam

656
00:51:33,423 --> 00:51:35,525
that you had been exposed to
Agent Orange.

657
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:37,117
Well, your mom was wrong...

658
00:51:50,277 --> 00:51:52,040
It wasn't Agent Orange.

659
00:51:52,380 --> 00:51:54,975
The Defence Department
called it Agent Pink.

660
00:51:56,018 --> 00:51:57,485
But then they probably
realized it was too strong,

661
00:51:57,520 --> 00:52:00,923
so they watered down the dioxin
and gave it a different name.

662
00:52:01,726 --> 00:52:03,695
But I was around
before they did that.

663
00:52:04,964 --> 00:52:06,261
What did it do to you?

664
00:52:06,433 --> 00:52:08,094
Nothing, really.

665
00:52:08,335 --> 00:52:09,598
Paul?

666
00:52:09,971 --> 00:52:12,374
Listen, someone needs to
figure out who killed this guy.

667
00:52:12,409 --> 00:52:13,890
It's extremely important to me.

668
00:52:13,925 --> 00:52:15,373
I can't do it
sitting around here.

669
00:52:16,245 --> 00:52:18,009
You've done well,
you've helped me.

670
00:52:18,182 --> 00:52:20,013
I wanna keep in touch.

671
00:52:34,535 --> 00:52:36,060
Hey, Alimi.

672
00:52:37,439 --> 00:52:39,743
<i>No one is available to take</i>
<i>your call right now.

673
00:52:39,778 --> 00:52:42,008
<i>Please leave a message</i>
<i>after the tone.

674
00:52:43,114 --> 00:52:45,140
Yeah, yeah. Sure thing...

675
00:52:46,686 --> 00:52:48,415
The "business" in question

676
00:52:48,688 --> 00:52:50,222
does not answer their

677
00:52:50,257 --> 00:52:53,421
business phone during
normal business hours.

678
00:52:58,702 --> 00:52:59,794
I'm going in!

679
00:53:20,364 --> 00:53:21,388
Huh!

680
00:53:23,368 --> 00:53:25,529
If I was paranoid,
that would look suspicious.

681
00:53:30,877 --> 00:53:34,440
Check for possible
one-man-submarine, out.

682
00:53:52,407 --> 00:53:53,635
Fertilizer!

683
00:53:55,410 --> 00:53:57,436
Oklahoma...

684
00:54:01,785 --> 00:54:03,321
<i>... with the approaching election

685
00:54:03,356 --> 00:54:04,487
<i>voters will have to decide

686
00:54:04,522 --> 00:54:07,390
<i>just how important</i>
<i>the issue really is.

687
00:54:07,593 --> 00:54:10,363
<i>Reporting live from Sacramento,</i>

688
00:54:10,398 --> 00:54:12,233

689
00:54:12,268 --> 00:54:13,393

690
00:54:14,202 --> 00:54:18,174

692
00:54:20,911 --> 00:54:23,574
<i>The following footage is of</i>
<i>a graphic nature.

693
00:54:27,153 --> 00:54:30,146
<i>The shelters were destroyed and</i>
<i>one of the men was killed.

694
00:54:30,357 --> 00:54:31,809
<i>There are no suspects</i>
<i>at this time

695
00:54:31,844 --> 00:54:33,769
<i>and the name of</i>
<i>the victim is being

696
00:54:33,804 --> 00:54:35,696
<i>withheld pending notification of relatives.

697
00:54:40,570 --> 00:54:42,869
It's being withheld because
they don't know what it is.

698
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:44,206
They'll figure it out.

699
00:54:44,241 --> 00:54:46,472
They'll have fingerprints
or something.

700
00:54:46,845 --> 00:54:49,379
I'd say at least half
the homeless that

701
00:54:49,414 --> 00:54:51,914
die on the streets are
never identified.

702
00:54:52,419 --> 00:54:54,149
What happens to them?

703
00:54:54,522 --> 00:54:56,285
They get cremated,

704
00:54:56,791 --> 00:54:59,762
tossed into a mass grave out
at the county cemetery.

705
00:54:59,963 --> 00:55:01,954
But he was murdered!

706
00:55:02,633 --> 00:55:05,370
The least that they can do
for him is to find his family.

707
00:55:05,405 --> 00:55:06,503
He deserves that much!

708
00:55:06,538 --> 00:55:11,170
The truth is,
nobody really cares about him.

709
00:55:21,725 --> 00:55:22,693
Bingo.

710
00:55:40,683 --> 00:55:42,618
Hi boss, I got it!

711
00:55:44,822 --> 00:55:47,314
The name of the
company is, uhm,

712
00:55:47,592 --> 00:55:49,627
IBC International
Boron Chemicals.

713
00:55:49,662 --> 00:55:52,566
They pretty much built the
town of Trona themselves.

714
00:55:52,601 --> 00:55:53,932
How far is it?

715
00:55:54,269 --> 00:55:55,361
Huh?

716
00:55:56,004 --> 00:55:57,671
How - far - is - it?

717
00:55:57,706 --> 00:55:59,607
Oh, how far is it? It's a,

718
00:56:01,611 --> 00:56:03,546
it's about a hundred
eighty miles.

719
00:56:03,748 --> 00:56:05,649
Anyway, the whole
town is, uh,

720
00:56:05,684 --> 00:56:09,586
is built on a dry salt lake,
in Death Valley.

721
00:56:09,688 --> 00:56:10,722
It says that

722
00:56:10,757 --> 00:56:13,726
the company is digging
out all sorts of minerals

723
00:56:13,761 --> 00:56:16,965
and chemicals from the salt flats
and turning them into Boron products.

724
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:20,629
And get this: They ship most of
the stuff to China!

725
00:56:22,004 --> 00:56:23,336
China?

726
00:56:23,371 --> 00:56:24,667
China!

727
00:56:38,727 --> 00:56:39,752
You said China.

728
00:56:39,962 --> 00:56:41,589
That's what it says.

729
00:56:42,733 --> 00:56:43,893
What else?

730
00:56:48,641 --> 00:56:52,746
it says that the area was originally settled
in eighteen seventy by this guy John Searles.

731
00:56:52,781 --> 00:56:55,416
His father was from Chicago
and he lived there...

732
00:56:55,451 --> 00:56:58,052
Is the lake bed secure?
Is the factory secure?

733
00:56:58,087 --> 00:57:00,554
Have there been
any reported break-ins?

734
00:57:00,589 --> 00:57:03,124
Do any of the names look Arabic
in the telephone book?

735
00:57:03,159 --> 00:57:07,655
How they transport the Boron to the
coast before it goes off to China?

736
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:10,534
Well, this is just
a preliminary report.

737
00:57:10,569 --> 00:57:12,467
I was gonna get into
all that stuff.

738
00:57:12,705 --> 00:57:14,674
Good. Because I'm going
there in the morning.

739
00:57:15,709 --> 00:57:18,406
Is that stuff turning blue yet
in the test tubes?

740
00:57:18,780 --> 00:57:20,816
That's gotta wait
at least a half hour.

741
00:57:20,851 --> 00:57:22,751
That's right.
You told me that.

742
00:57:31,197 --> 00:57:32,444
Are you okay?

743
00:57:32,479 --> 00:57:33,693
What do you mean?

744
00:57:35,703 --> 00:57:37,706
I can see that your
Agent Pink is acting up.

745
00:57:37,741 --> 00:57:39,706
It's... it's on your neck...

746
00:57:39,741 --> 00:57:41,944
It comes and it goes.
I can't stop it, you know that.

747
00:57:41,979 --> 00:57:43,644
Oh, yeah, but I also know that

748
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:45,849
when you get yourself too worked up,
it just makes it worse.

749
00:57:45,884 --> 00:57:47,681
I'm not "worked up".

750
00:57:47,752 --> 00:57:49,049
Alright.

751
00:57:49,487 --> 00:57:51,690
I got you more meds through the
Canadian deal. They're in...

752
00:57:51,725 --> 00:57:54,261
We have a critical
situation here, Jimmy!

753
00:57:54,296 --> 00:57:56,763
We may be dealing with
the major cell!

754
00:57:56,798 --> 00:57:59,935
Our work could be saving thousands
of lives, maybe more!

755
00:57:59,970 --> 00:58:01,703
And you want me to be
calm right now?!

756
00:58:01,738 --> 00:58:04,799
Now is not the fucking
time to be calm! Okay?!

757
00:58:05,176 --> 00:58:05,941
Okay.

758
00:58:05,976 --> 00:58:07,569
America needs us!

759
00:58:07,813 --> 00:58:10,180
Jimmy, I'm gonna need you for
my C & C on this one.

760
00:58:10,550 --> 00:58:12,116
If I need tags pulled,

761
00:58:12,151 --> 00:58:15,924
if I need to have a background
check or a favour pulled,

762
00:58:15,959 --> 00:58:20,162
I need you to... you need to
stick by that phone!

763
00:58:20,197 --> 00:58:21,926
If I have to reach out,

764
00:58:22,265 --> 00:58:24,096
I gotta know you're
gonna be there.

765
00:58:24,501 --> 00:58:26,803
Alright, I'll be your REMF
on this one, Serge.

766
00:58:26,838 --> 00:58:29,830
The phone will never
ring more than once.

767
00:58:29,942 --> 00:58:32,467
They're trying to
destroy our country!

768
00:58:33,112 --> 00:58:35,444
They're trying to infect us!

769
00:58:36,484 --> 00:58:38,247
I am not gonna let 'em.

770
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:40,854
I am not gonna let them do it!

771
00:58:52,906 --> 00:58:56,809
You want, uh, a bottle of
Tiger Piss?

772
00:58:58,614 --> 00:59:01,778
Yeah... that sounds good.

773
00:59:07,559 --> 00:59:08,792
Semper Fi!

774
00:59:08,827 --> 00:59:10,089
De Oppresso Liber!

775
00:59:15,569 --> 00:59:17,093
I got a case inside the house.

776
00:59:17,905 --> 00:59:18,804
Good.

777
00:59:32,792 --> 00:59:33,918
Did you know him?

778
00:59:33,993 --> 00:59:36,189
I am just trying to help
find his family.

779
00:59:38,667 --> 00:59:40,532
Okay. Just a minute.

780
01:00:11,710 --> 01:00:12,973
Excuse me!

781
01:00:31,436 --> 01:00:35,242
That was the drive-by killing on
Winston Street, right?

782
01:00:35,277 --> 01:00:36,800
Right.

783
01:00:42,250 --> 01:00:44,310
Still at the coroner's office.

784
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:47,747
He's been upgraded
from a John Doe, though.

785
01:00:49,761 --> 01:00:53,254
It says his name is
Hassan Ahmed.

786
01:00:53,666 --> 01:00:54,964
A-h-m-e-d?

787
01:00:55,168 --> 01:00:56,658
That's it.

788
01:00:56,970 --> 01:00:58,973
Hassan Ahmed.
Thank you so much.

789
01:00:59,008 --> 01:01:00,065
Any time.

790
01:01:31,115 --> 01:01:32,482
You forgot your phone.

791
01:01:32,517 --> 01:01:34,918
<i>Hey, Paul, it's Lana...

792
01:01:35,121 --> 01:01:37,021
Oh, no, this is uh...

793
01:01:37,056 --> 01:01:39,259
this is Jimmy.
We met the other day.

794
01:01:39,294 --> 01:01:41,125
Hi, Jimmy. Um,

795
01:01:42,997 --> 01:01:45,733
is my uncle there?
I need to talk to him.

796
01:01:45,768 --> 01:01:48,829
<i>No, he already, um,</i>
<i>he already left.

797
01:01:50,475 --> 01:01:53,343
Uh, okay, well,
how can I reach him?

798
01:01:54,079 --> 01:01:56,314
I have some information

799
01:01:56,349 --> 01:01:58,419
<i>regarding a case that</i>
<i>he's working on.

800
01:01:58,454 --> 01:02:00,011
Oh, really?

801
01:02:00,555 --> 01:02:04,219
What... what case
might that be?

802
01:02:04,761 --> 01:02:07,492
The murder, Jimmy...
With Hassan and the Hummer.

803
01:02:07,898 --> 01:02:10,162
<i>Oh... Oh, so you know</i>
<i>all about that, huh?

804
01:02:11,836 --> 01:02:12,368
Yeah.

805
01:02:12,403 --> 01:02:14,170
<i>He already left for Trona

806
01:02:14,205 --> 01:02:17,175
and I guess he'd left
his cell phone.

807
01:02:17,778 --> 01:02:19,370
He left for Trona?

808
01:02:21,415 --> 01:02:23,118
<i>Can you do me a favour?

809
01:02:23,153 --> 01:02:24,518
When you do talk to him,

810
01:02:24,553 --> 01:02:27,090
will you let him know that
I know who the victim was,

811
01:02:27,125 --> 01:02:29,059
and that I need to
speak to him?

812
01:02:29,126 --> 01:02:31,193
Alright. I'll...
I'll tell him.

813
01:02:31,228 --> 01:02:33,993
<i>Well, I appreciate it very much.</i>
<i>Thank you, Jimmy.

814
01:03:12,951 --> 01:03:14,214
Sergeant?

815
01:03:16,255 --> 01:03:18,019
Paul?

816
01:03:20,428 --> 01:03:22,089
Oh, shit!

817
01:03:23,198 --> 01:03:24,222
Give me a minute!

818
01:03:30,241 --> 01:03:31,408
No other listing?

819
01:03:31,443 --> 01:03:33,645
No, no, that's the only one
that I can find

820
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:35,381
and it's disconnected.

821
01:03:35,416 --> 01:03:36,575
Okay,

822
01:03:37,584 --> 01:03:42,657
uh, I think I've got
a number of a...

823
01:03:42,692 --> 01:03:46,219
parish in Ridgecrest.

824
01:03:49,599 --> 01:03:51,467
It's twenty miles from Trona,

825
01:03:51,502 --> 01:03:53,903
so maybe they can send
someone over.

826
01:03:54,172 --> 01:03:55,207
Oh, that'd be great!

827
01:03:55,242 --> 01:03:56,299
Yeah.

828
01:04:00,301 --> 01:04:03,302
What day is it, anyway?

829
01:04:03,302 --> 01:04:06,303
Alright!

830
01:04:22,308 --> 01:04:25,309
Hi...

831
01:04:25,309 --> 01:04:28,310
I needed to be somewhere today.

832
01:04:28,310 --> 01:04:31,311
Instead, I'm talking to my
twenty year old niece

833
01:04:31,311 --> 01:04:34,312
who all of a sudden wants to
become a private detective.

834
01:04:34,312 --> 01:04:37,313
I'm just trying to help.

835
01:04:37,313 --> 01:04:40,314
I don't need your help!

836
01:04:40,314 --> 01:04:43,315
Where can we talk?

837
01:04:43,315 --> 01:04:46,316
Should we go on the roof?

838
01:04:46,316 --> 01:04:49,317
Good view point...

839
01:04:49,317 --> 01:04:52,318
Okay, so what's his name?

840
01:04:52,318 --> 01:04:55,319
His name is Ahmed.

841
01:04:55,319 --> 01:04:58,320
Ahmed?

842
01:04:58,320 --> 01:05:01,321
Yeah, and I talked
to his brother.

843
01:05:01,321 --> 01:05:04,322
Excuse me?

844
01:05:04,322 --> 01:05:07,323
Well, to his half-brother,
actually.

845
01:05:07,323 --> 01:05:10,323
And that's his only
living relative.

846
01:05:10,323 --> 01:05:13,324
You contacted his brother?

847
01:05:13,324 --> 01:05:16,326
No. The morgue did.

848
01:05:16,326 --> 01:05:19,327
Well, a parish from
Ridgecrest actually,

849
01:05:19,327 --> 01:05:22,328
but then the morgue,
sort of. It's...

850
01:05:22,328 --> 01:05:25,329
And then he called,
he called Henry.

851
01:05:25,329 --> 01:05:28,330
Lana, what the hell are
you talking about?

852
01:05:28,330 --> 01:05:31,331
Well, they need help.

853
01:05:31,331 --> 01:05:34,332
Uhm, the LA morgue e-mailed
a photo of Hassan to Trona.

854
01:05:34,332 --> 01:05:37,333
And his brother
identified the photo,

855
01:05:37,333 --> 01:05:40,334
but he doesn't have a car.

856
01:05:40,334 --> 01:05:43,335
And Henry has offered to pay
for the burial,

857
01:05:43,335 --> 01:05:46,336
but he only has a truck and I don't
think it's appropriate to trans...

858
01:05:46,336 --> 01:05:49,337
I, now wait... Who's Henry?

859
01:05:49,337 --> 01:05:52,338
He's the pastor from here.

860
01:05:52,338 --> 01:05:55,338
You've entirely disrupted
this investigation!

861
01:05:55,338 --> 01:05:58,339
I mean, you don't
have a damn clue

862
01:05:58,339 --> 01:06:01,340
- what's at stake here!
- Okay, I'm sorry,

863
01:06:01,340 --> 01:06:04,341
I didn't mean to
disrupted anything...

864
01:06:04,341 --> 01:06:07,342
Okay, I thought that this
information would help you.

865
01:06:07,342 --> 01:06:10,344
How's this supposed
to help me, huh?

866
01:06:10,344 --> 01:06:13,345
Well, the brother, I mean he
might have some information

867
01:06:13,345 --> 01:06:16,346
that you could use, and...

868
01:06:16,346 --> 01:06:19,347
Yeah?

869
01:06:19,347 --> 01:06:22,348
...and if we woulda take
the body home

870
01:06:22,348 --> 01:06:25,349
then that might be kind of a
good cover for you.

871
01:06:25,349 --> 01:06:28,350
A good cover?!

872
01:06:28,350 --> 01:06:31,351
That's great!
That's just, that's perfect!

873
01:06:31,351 --> 01:06:34,352
Okay...

874
01:06:34,352 --> 01:06:37,353
It all worked out.

875
01:06:37,353 --> 01:06:40,353
Oh, good.

876
01:06:40,353 --> 01:06:43,354
Listen, I appreciate your help.

877
01:06:43,354 --> 01:06:46,355
Likewise.

878
01:06:46,355 --> 01:06:49,356
A lot of people wouldn't
take the time.

879
01:06:49,356 --> 01:06:52,357
No, they wouldn't.

880
01:06:52,357 --> 01:06:55,358
So, uh, what've you got there,
a little flag?

881
01:06:55,358 --> 01:06:58,359
That's right.

882
01:06:58,359 --> 01:07:01,360
So, uh, you're looking
after my niece?

883
01:07:02,361 --> 01:07:03,746
Well, I just gave her a room.

884
01:07:04,018 --> 01:07:05,987
She's pretty good at looking
after herself.

885
01:07:06,288 --> 01:07:08,280
So, you're looking
after her, then?

886
01:07:09,025 --> 01:07:13,327
Yeah, of course.
She's only twenty or so.

887
01:07:17,970 --> 01:07:18,995
Over here!

888
01:07:24,012 --> 01:07:25,240
Wheel it in closer!

889
01:07:25,346 --> 01:07:26,245
In there?

890
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:27,596
Yeah, in here.
What'd you think?

891
01:07:27,631 --> 01:07:28,911
We're gonna tie
him up on top?

892
01:07:29,752 --> 01:07:31,084
Okay, let's go!

893
01:07:36,094 --> 01:07:37,254
Wow, wow...

894
01:07:38,163 --> 01:07:40,155
Oh, I've never seen a set-up
like that before!

895
01:07:40,733 --> 01:07:41,632
Excuse me!

896
01:07:46,374 --> 01:07:47,808
You got everything?

897
01:07:48,044 --> 01:07:49,443
I'm..., no.

898
01:07:49,913 --> 01:07:51,081
You're going to need the
coroner's report.

899
01:07:51,116 --> 01:07:52,743
- Did they put that in there?
- Yeah.

900
01:07:58,792 --> 01:07:59,604
You're all set.

901
01:07:59,639 --> 01:08:00,417
Alright, thanks.

902
01:08:03,931 --> 01:08:05,422
Touch base, if you can.

903
01:08:06,134 --> 01:08:07,397
Just give me a call.

904
01:08:14,044 --> 01:08:15,102
God speed!

905
01:08:51,094 --> 01:08:53,325
I guess, you probably
think I'm...

906
01:08:53,765 --> 01:08:58,169
one of these vets that got all
screwed up in 'Nam, right?

907
01:08:58,804 --> 01:09:00,773
On the brink of insanity,

908
01:09:00,808 --> 01:09:02,173
- right?
- Nope...

909
01:09:04,145 --> 01:09:08,480
I'd love you anyway though,
"Uncle" Paul.

910
01:09:13,891 --> 01:09:16,827
You want me to tell you something
about the Vietnam War?

911
01:09:18,063 --> 01:09:19,030
Yeah.

912
01:09:22,969 --> 01:09:24,267
We won!

913
01:09:25,106 --> 01:09:26,300
The war?

914
01:09:26,608 --> 01:09:28,041
That's right!

915
01:09:33,017 --> 01:09:34,279
Metaphorically?

916
01:09:34,485 --> 01:09:37,080
No, in actuality.

917
01:09:39,591 --> 01:09:42,254
It wasn't just the
Vietnam War, you know.

918
01:09:43,897 --> 01:09:46,799
There was a little thing
called the "Cold War", too.

919
01:09:47,302 --> 01:09:48,462
Right.

920
01:09:51,240 --> 01:09:55,201
We stopped the spread of Communism
for ten thousand days.

921
01:09:56,914 --> 01:09:58,974
We drew a line in the jungle,

922
01:10:01,054 --> 01:10:04,081
and eventually they crossed it,
but when they did,

923
01:10:05,893 --> 01:10:08,260
they were already depleted.

924
01:10:09,298 --> 01:10:11,357
They were completely exhausted.

925
01:10:13,904 --> 01:10:15,497
It was a critical time.

926
01:10:17,475 --> 01:10:19,171
A critical place.

927
01:10:21,314 --> 01:10:22,303
We won!

928
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:56,687
Uncle Paul,
can I ask you a question?

929
01:10:58,397 --> 01:11:00,195
Sure. What do you wanna know?

930
01:11:00,934 --> 01:11:03,563
How come you never
wrote my mom back?

931
01:11:08,443 --> 01:11:11,378
She sent you all those
letters over the years,

932
01:11:11,580 --> 01:11:14,174
can you just tell me why?

933
01:11:15,185 --> 01:11:17,416
I just never opened them,
that's all.

934
01:11:19,057 --> 01:11:20,355
Why?

935
01:11:21,493 --> 01:11:24,190
Well, it's hard to explain.

936
01:11:26,233 --> 01:11:29,397
Listen, sometimes in life, you just
can't sit there, you know.

937
01:11:31,406 --> 01:11:33,466
Sometimes you have
to make a break.

938
01:11:37,649 --> 01:11:40,244
The only way to leave
something behind,

939
01:11:42,321 --> 01:11:44,415
is to leave it all behind.

940
01:11:48,396 --> 01:11:51,093
We didn't always see
eye to eye, you know.

941
01:11:54,205 --> 01:11:58,369
All that fanatic
commie liberal stuff,

942
01:11:58,642 --> 01:12:00,445
and dragging you
around to all those

943
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:02,675
god-forsaken countries...

944
01:12:06,387 --> 01:12:08,754
But I guess she was
a good mother.

945
01:12:10,125 --> 01:12:11,286
She was.

946
01:12:12,261 --> 01:12:14,457
She should have taught you
what America means.

947
01:12:14,698 --> 01:12:16,466
What it stands for.

948
01:12:16,501 --> 01:12:17,467
She did.

949
01:12:17,502 --> 01:12:19,738
She taught me everything that
it's supposed to stand for.

950
01:12:19,773 --> 01:12:21,774
I think that's the reason
I came back.

951
01:12:21,809 --> 01:12:23,333
Supposed to?

952
01:12:33,456 --> 01:12:35,186
We're in Trona.

953
01:12:39,297 --> 01:12:41,458
Paul Jeffries,
September eighteen,

954
01:12:42,133 --> 01:12:44,625
heading north on
one-seventy-eight...

955
01:12:45,304 --> 01:12:47,500
Now entering the town of Trona.

956
01:12:56,687 --> 01:12:58,120
He lives in the trailer park.

957
01:12:58,155 --> 01:13:00,124
But it doesn't say
which trailer.

958
01:13:00,358 --> 01:13:01,491
Excuse me, please.

959
01:13:01,526 --> 01:13:04,397
We've arrived at position one,
the trailer park.

960
01:13:04,432 --> 01:13:06,628
Outskirts of Trona, California.

961
01:13:07,835 --> 01:13:09,804
Greenwich Mean Time fourteen
hundred hours...

962
01:13:09,839 --> 01:13:11,272
...Fourteen twelve!

963
01:13:11,474 --> 01:13:12,463
What?

964
01:13:12,608 --> 01:13:14,600
It's actually fourteen twelve.

965
01:13:14,845 --> 01:13:16,478
I don't know if that matters?

966
01:13:16,513 --> 01:13:19,108
General time frame is
all I'm looking for.

967
01:13:30,731 --> 01:13:33,235
Preliminary observation
detects inconsistencies,

968
01:13:33,270 --> 01:13:34,669
right off the bat.

969
01:13:35,371 --> 01:13:36,605
There are approximately

970
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:39,371
twelve to fifteen
dwellings in the compound,

971
01:13:39,444 --> 01:13:42,812
yet for some reason, there are
about forty mailboxes.

972
01:13:43,449 --> 01:13:45,543
I'd like to see someone
explain that one!

973
01:13:47,487 --> 01:13:48,887
Paul...

974
01:13:49,757 --> 01:13:52,159
I was thinking that
it might be best

975
01:13:52,194 --> 01:13:56,131
if I went in and spoke to the family
while you took care of the body.

976
01:13:56,467 --> 01:13:58,264
If that's okay with you.

977
01:13:58,469 --> 01:14:01,173
I just thought that it just might
seem a little bit strange,

978
01:14:01,208 --> 01:14:03,574
driving there with
him in the back.

979
01:14:04,243 --> 01:14:05,677
- It's fine with me.
- Okay...

980
01:14:06,346 --> 01:14:08,416
So why don't we meet back
somewhere over here,

981
01:14:08,451 --> 01:14:10,484
when you're done with the
funeral home, huh?

982
01:14:10,519 --> 01:14:11,474
Sure.

983
01:14:12,220 --> 01:14:13,415
Okay.

984
01:14:14,890 --> 01:14:16,152
Great!

985
01:14:18,962 --> 01:14:21,796
Hey! Hey!

986
01:14:22,467 --> 01:14:24,936
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

987
01:14:26,606 --> 01:14:28,268
What do you think you're doing?

988
01:14:28,943 --> 01:14:29,940
What?

989
01:14:29,975 --> 01:14:30,938
What?!

990
01:14:31,346 --> 01:14:33,542
Does this look like an
amusement park to you?

991
01:14:33,983 --> 01:14:35,746
Do you see any roller coasters?

992
01:14:35,952 --> 01:14:37,853
I don't see any ferries-wheels.

993
01:14:38,589 --> 01:14:40,387
I don't know what you mean.

994
01:14:40,692 --> 01:14:43,963
Listen, don't get delusions
or anything like that,

995
01:14:43,998 --> 01:14:46,524
but you're not
an operative on this.

996
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:50,268
But anyway,
I have some stuff here...

997
01:14:51,873 --> 01:14:53,774
Police-issued pepper spray...

998
01:14:54,010 --> 01:14:55,943
Don't point that
toward your face!

999
01:14:57,747 --> 01:14:59,682
You may need this...

1000
01:15:00,951 --> 01:15:03,648
Do you really think that
I'm gonna need a flashlight?

1001
01:15:03,755 --> 01:15:05,314
And this.

1002
01:15:05,591 --> 01:15:07,026
If you have to ditch everything,

1003
01:15:07,061 --> 01:15:08,619
you do not ditch this!

1004
01:15:09,563 --> 01:15:11,532
Alright, maybe you
don't need that.

1005
01:15:13,402 --> 01:15:16,668
Okay, channel three.
It has a twenty mile range.

1006
01:15:17,674 --> 01:15:20,235
Now, you tell me you
need me, I'm there.

1007
01:15:20,945 --> 01:15:22,607
I'm your uncle,

1008
01:15:22,748 --> 01:15:24,684
but that part doesn't
really matter...

1009
01:15:24,719 --> 01:15:26,845
You're on my Op. Remember,

1010
01:15:27,488 --> 01:15:29,319
- okay... You got it?
- Got it!

1011
01:15:29,556 --> 01:15:30,690
I said three, right?

1012
01:15:30,725 --> 01:15:32,327
- Channel three?
- Channel three.

1013
01:15:32,362 --> 01:15:33,522
Okay.

1014
01:16:11,713 --> 01:16:12,908
Hello?

1015
01:16:14,717 --> 01:16:15,946
What?

1016
01:16:16,586 --> 01:16:18,154
I'm sorry,
I don't mean to disturb you.

1017
01:16:18,189 --> 01:16:20,885
I'm looking for Mr. Ahmed.

1018
01:16:21,493 --> 01:16:22,926
What do you want?

1019
01:16:23,962 --> 01:16:27,729
I'm helping out with a family issue.
He's expecting me.

1020
01:16:32,974 --> 01:16:34,737
What? What's the matter?

1021
01:16:35,009 --> 01:16:39,607
Well, uh, Mr. Ahmed,
I'm just trying to find his home.

1022
01:16:40,517 --> 01:16:43,146
I don't know anybody
like that, no!

1023
01:16:43,855 --> 01:16:45,721
Is he... Is he dark-skin?

1024
01:16:45,924 --> 01:16:47,058
Excuse me?

1025
01:16:47,093 --> 01:16:50,154
The dark-skin guy lives in the
last trailer up the hill.

1026
01:16:50,564 --> 01:16:52,122
The last trailer up the hill...

1027
01:16:59,510 --> 01:17:00,709
It's Paul Jeffries.

1028
01:17:00,744 --> 01:17:02,610
Fourteen hundred
and twenty hours,

1029
01:17:02,847 --> 01:17:06,045
one hundred and eighty miles from
the epicentre of Los Angeles.

1030
01:17:06,452 --> 01:17:07,920
Striking distance,

1031
01:17:08,221 --> 01:17:11,054
but a world apart! Trona.

1032
01:17:11,758 --> 01:17:13,522
Look at this place!

1033
01:17:14,495 --> 01:17:15,793
A couple of pedestrians,

1034
01:17:16,031 --> 01:17:18,762
a few stool pigeons sitting
around without a clue...

1035
01:17:20,804 --> 01:17:22,170
But they're here!

1036
01:17:23,842 --> 01:17:26,710
Sleeper cells.
I can feel 'em!

1037
01:17:47,941 --> 01:17:49,203
Hello?

1038
01:17:51,145 --> 01:17:53,614
Massive numbers of
burned dwellings.

1039
01:17:54,049 --> 01:17:58,453
Completely... charred,
flamed to the ground.

1040
01:18:00,590 --> 01:18:03,795
At first pass I can determine
no clear pattern,

1041
01:18:03,830 --> 01:18:05,490
aside from arson.

1042
01:18:08,801 --> 01:18:10,770
Somebody lit these fires.

1043
01:18:11,037 --> 01:18:13,802
Probably to cover
their traces...

1044
01:18:17,847 --> 01:18:20,681
I bet I'm being
observed myself...

1045
01:18:21,218 --> 01:18:25,246
It's just like in 'Nam. Burnin'
the damn Elephant Grass...

1046
01:18:25,657 --> 01:18:29,288
They know I'm here.
Somebody does!

1047
01:18:44,882 --> 01:18:46,179
Mr. Ahmed?

1048
01:19:31,344 --> 01:19:33,279
This is the body from
Los Angeles.

1049
01:19:33,714 --> 01:19:35,342
Somebody is expecting it.

1050
01:19:35,984 --> 01:19:37,016
Me?

1051
01:19:37,051 --> 01:19:38,952
I don't know?
Are you expecting it?

1052
01:19:39,321 --> 01:19:40,589
We use a gurney for that.

1053
01:19:40,624 --> 01:19:41,625
Well, I don't really
like gurneys.

1054
01:19:41,660 --> 01:19:43,321
And I'm on kind of a schedule.

1055
01:19:43,928 --> 01:19:44,927
What's the matter with you?

1056
01:19:44,962 --> 01:19:46,988
You've never seen a
dead body before?

1057
01:19:47,733 --> 01:19:50,100
Put that thing over
there in that room!

1058
01:19:51,304 --> 01:19:52,169
Jesus!

1059
01:20:06,025 --> 01:20:07,390
I'm watching you!

1060
01:20:23,881 --> 01:20:25,007
Hello!

1061
01:20:25,717 --> 01:20:28,277
You are from the mission?
With Henry?

1062
01:20:28,721 --> 01:20:29,813
Yeah!

1063
01:20:31,157 --> 01:20:34,959
God bless you!
God bless you.

1064
01:20:38,300 --> 01:20:41,759
I am eternally grateful to you.
Whoever you are.

1065
01:20:41,971 --> 01:20:43,171
I'm Lana.

1066
01:20:43,206 --> 01:20:44,371
And I am Joe.

1067
01:20:45,242 --> 01:20:46,801
Nice to meet you.

1068
01:20:47,012 --> 01:20:49,072
It's good to meet you, Lana.

1069
01:20:50,083 --> 01:20:51,141
Huh, let's see. Um,

1070
01:20:51,919 --> 01:20:56,379
I have tea, water and
some very bad vodka.

1071
01:20:57,058 --> 01:20:58,758
Tea sounds lovely.

1072
01:20:58,793 --> 01:21:00,989
We'll have tea. Come, go!

1073
01:21:03,834 --> 01:21:05,096
They just throw things out.

1074
01:21:07,105 --> 01:21:08,971
Perfectly good things.

1075
01:21:10,175 --> 01:21:11,700
Not in the mood for it anymore?

1076
01:21:11,911 --> 01:21:12,969
...Trash it!

1077
01:21:29,935 --> 01:21:31,062
I'm gonna take it!

1078
01:21:33,406 --> 01:21:34,840
What is that?

1079
01:21:39,782 --> 01:21:40,976
Chemicals!

1080
01:21:48,527 --> 01:21:51,964
Located probable retired mobile

1081
01:21:52,198 --> 01:21:55,760
chemical and or biological
manufacturing unit.

1082
01:21:56,971 --> 01:21:58,370
Going aboard.

1083
01:22:10,489 --> 01:22:12,981
Pistol targets! Ah, huh!

1084
01:22:14,962 --> 01:22:16,224
Wood stove!

1085
01:22:25,007 --> 01:22:27,169
Strange green liquid...

1086
01:22:42,365 --> 01:22:44,356
Holy shit!

1087
01:22:46,303 --> 01:22:48,204
It's Borax boxes!

1088
01:22:51,110 --> 01:22:52,304
Who is this?

1089
01:22:54,681 --> 01:22:57,446
Two new suspects
approaching in van.

1090
01:22:58,219 --> 01:22:59,619
They're getting out...

1091
01:23:02,926 --> 01:23:04,059
They're loading the boxes!

1092
01:23:04,094 --> 01:23:06,222
They're loading the boxes
into the vehicle!

1093
01:23:09,001 --> 01:23:09,989
Jesus!

1094
01:23:10,334 --> 01:23:12,462
I go in for closer observation.

1095
01:23:31,130 --> 01:23:35,295
Observe, track and report.
I just hold off for now...

1096
01:23:36,237 --> 01:23:39,071
Never interrupt the enemy when
he's making a mistake!

1097
01:23:39,474 --> 01:23:43,138
Just lay chilly, wait it out.

1098
01:23:48,119 --> 01:23:50,019
Suspects fleeing.
I'm going for the van.

1099
01:24:02,271 --> 01:24:03,465
On Yasuf's porch

1100
01:24:04,139 --> 01:24:05,698
Got it! Alright.

1101
01:24:06,276 --> 01:24:08,142
Let's... look at these.

1102
01:24:09,313 --> 01:24:10,614
Oh, who is that?

1103
01:24:10,649 --> 01:24:13,983
This is my father.
And Hassan's father.

1104
01:24:14,320 --> 01:24:16,090
Where was that picture taken?

1105
01:24:16,125 --> 01:24:17,557
This is in Pakistan...

1106
01:24:19,160 --> 01:24:21,355
- Look at his pants.
- Aha...

1107
01:24:21,697 --> 01:24:23,221
Funny, huh?

1108
01:24:24,266 --> 01:24:25,334
They're pulling out of town!

1109
01:24:25,369 --> 01:24:28,271
Going south now on
one-seven-eight.

1110
01:24:32,244 --> 01:24:33,507
They're baiting me.

1111
01:24:34,147 --> 01:24:36,343
They think they're luring me in.

1112
01:24:37,318 --> 01:24:40,253
That'll be the day, my friend...

1113
01:24:41,255 --> 01:24:43,247
You back me into a corner

1114
01:24:44,059 --> 01:24:45,994
and you'll rue that day, Chuck!

1115
01:24:46,262 --> 01:24:50,166
You'll rue that day
for a long time!

1116
01:25:02,084 --> 01:25:04,109
He's turning left into the side road.

1117
01:25:21,610 --> 01:25:24,480
Suspect vehicle parked in
front of isolated house.

1118
01:25:24,515 --> 01:25:25,513
That's perfect!

1119
01:25:25,548 --> 01:25:27,380
It's a perfect sleeper hide-out...

1120
01:25:27,617 --> 01:25:29,175
Probably goes underground.

1121
01:25:34,593 --> 01:25:36,394
Probable chemical
weapons containers

1122
01:25:36,429 --> 01:25:39,533
being transported into
what is most likely

1123
01:25:39,568 --> 01:25:41,365
Trona headquarters.

1124
01:25:42,237 --> 01:25:43,704
Suspects out of view.

1125
01:25:46,810 --> 01:25:48,641
Huh... This is it!

1126
01:25:50,682 --> 01:25:52,445
You've done your job.

1127
01:25:53,486 --> 01:25:55,318
You've done your job well.

1128
01:25:56,690 --> 01:25:59,489
Every time I told you
to be patient

1129
01:25:59,794 --> 01:26:01,524
and you wouldn't listen,

1130
01:26:02,898 --> 01:26:04,491
well this is why.

1131
01:26:06,737 --> 01:26:08,937
You stick to your game plan,

1132
01:26:08,972 --> 01:26:11,138
you stick to your strategy

1133
01:26:11,342 --> 01:26:13,243
and you never fluctuate.

1134
01:26:14,713 --> 01:26:17,444
And then you find yourself here!

1135
01:26:23,591 --> 01:26:25,719
These are the moments
that define your life.

1136
01:26:29,332 --> 01:26:31,469
My father and
his brother at his

1137
01:26:31,504 --> 01:26:32,903
brother's wedding, and...

1138
01:26:33,238 --> 01:26:36,470
Oh, and here is my mother.
Look at her!

1139
01:26:40,548 --> 01:26:42,851
This is a picture of Hassan
and me together,

1140
01:26:42,886 --> 01:26:44,649
at his wedding.

1141
01:26:45,454 --> 01:26:49,360
Suspects loading full chemical
containers into cargo van.

1142
01:26:49,395 --> 01:26:51,108
License plate
has been recorded,

1143
01:26:51,143 --> 01:26:52,822
clear photographs
had been obtained.

1144
01:26:54,532 --> 01:26:57,297
Individuals leaving the scene.

1145
01:26:58,872 --> 01:27:01,637
I will not continue
surveillance of the vehicle.

1146
01:27:02,276 --> 01:27:05,769
Repeat, vehicle is
free of observation.

1147
01:27:09,753 --> 01:27:12,591
SSG Jeffries, SSG Jeffries.

1148
01:27:12,626 --> 01:27:13,489
<i>Copy?

1149
01:27:14,894 --> 01:27:16,589
<i>SSG Jeffries, come in.

1150
01:27:16,929 --> 01:27:19,296
Oh! I'm sorry!

1151
01:27:19,533 --> 01:27:22,628
<i>SSG Jeffries,</i>
<i>SSG Jeffries, copy?

1152
01:27:24,540 --> 01:27:27,442
Uhm, uh, that's my uncle.
Uh, he...

1153
01:27:27,477 --> 01:27:30,538
<i>SSG Jeffries, SSG Jeffries,</i>
<i>come in.

1154
01:27:31,816 --> 01:27:34,547
SSG Jeffries. Copy?

1155
01:27:36,556 --> 01:27:39,557
Um, this is...
L. Swenson... reporting...

1156
01:27:39,592 --> 01:27:42,892
<i>Do you have my cell phone number</i>
<i>in your possession? Over.

1157
01:27:43,932 --> 01:27:46,561
Copy... Yes, I have it.

1158
01:27:46,902 --> 01:27:48,903
<i>Listen to me very carefully.

1159
01:27:48,938 --> 01:27:51,841
If you do not hear from me within
the next twenty minutes,

1160
01:27:52,043 --> 01:27:54,043
I want you to call that number.

1161
01:27:54,078 --> 01:27:56,513
It will be forwarded
to an operative.

1162
01:27:56,548 --> 01:27:59,347
And he'll make arrangements
for you. Over.

1163
01:28:00,454 --> 01:28:02,206
What do you mean?
What arrangements?

1164
01:28:02,241 --> 01:28:04,285
In the event
I become indisposed,

1165
01:28:04,320 --> 01:28:06,329
he will transport
you back to base.

1166
01:28:06,364 --> 01:28:07,990
To your mission. Over.

1167
01:28:09,600 --> 01:28:12,335
If you become "indisposed" in the
next twenty minutes,

1168
01:28:12,370 --> 01:28:15,341
I'm supposed to call a number that
will be forwarded to an operative?

1169
01:28:15,376 --> 01:28:16,638
<i>Affirmative.

1170
01:28:16,742 --> 01:28:18,802
No fucking way!

1171
01:28:19,112 --> 01:28:20,546
What?

1172
01:28:20,715 --> 01:28:23,619
No! Tell me where you are and
what the hell you're doing?

1173
01:28:23,654 --> 01:28:25,753
<i>You watch your mouth,</i>
<i>young lady.

1174
01:28:25,788 --> 01:28:27,688
Wait, uncle Paul, please!

1175
01:28:27,756 --> 01:28:30,694
I am not at liberty to
disclose this information.

1176
01:28:30,729 --> 01:28:32,530
And I also strongly suggest
you refrain from

1177
01:28:32,565 --> 01:28:33,729
addressing me in that manner.

1178
01:28:33,764 --> 01:28:35,734
<i>This is simply a precautionary</i>
<i>procedure. Out!

1179
01:28:35,769 --> 01:28:37,600
Wait, Uncle Paul!

1180
01:28:39,605 --> 01:28:43,065
This is Staff Sergeant Paul Jeffries,
US Army Special Forces.

1181
01:28:43,778 --> 01:28:46,942
It is seventeen hundred hours,
September eighteen.

1182
01:28:48,719 --> 01:28:49,743
I'm going in!

1183
01:29:51,969 --> 01:29:54,039
<i>First of all, I want to</i>
<i>thank you all for coming.

1184
01:29:54,074 --> 01:29:56,940
<i>It warms our heart.</i>
<i>It's a big crowd.

1185
01:29:57,142 --> 01:29:58,734
<i>We're honoured.

1186
01:29:58,977 --> 01:30:00,830
<i>The last two and a half years,

1187
01:30:00,865 --> 01:30:03,309
<i>our nation has acted decisively,

1188
01:30:03,344 --> 01:30:05,754
<i>to confront great challenges,

1189
01:30:05,789 --> 01:30:07,221
You dress funny.

1190
01:30:10,059 --> 01:30:13,125
But I guess you could say
the same thing about me.

1191
01:30:13,160 --> 01:30:16,191
<i>I came to this office</i>
<i>to solve problems,

1192
01:30:17,069 --> 01:30:21,598
Whatever is left to pack is
back there in the corner.

1193
01:30:22,510 --> 01:30:24,876
There should be some boxes.

1194
01:30:28,718 --> 01:30:33,213
For two months, no one has been
able to fix this.

1195
01:30:33,691 --> 01:30:36,696
I've been stuck
on the same channel!

1196
01:30:36,731 --> 01:30:39,665
I can only control the volume!

1197
01:30:43,604 --> 01:30:47,507
<i>Terrorists declared war on the</i>
<i>United States of America.

1198
01:30:47,642 --> 01:30:50,168
<i>And war is what they got.

1199
01:30:53,918 --> 01:30:55,283
Oh!

1200
01:31:00,693 --> 01:31:02,491
Thank you, friend.

1201
01:31:07,102 --> 01:31:08,661
You're welcome.

1202
01:31:37,642 --> 01:31:38,836
You're in the shit?

1203
01:31:40,346 --> 01:31:42,281
No. I checked it out.

1204
01:31:43,016 --> 01:31:44,917
Those people are
the wrong people.

1205
01:31:45,987 --> 01:31:47,819
A subdivision, maybe...

1206
01:31:48,958 --> 01:31:51,394
<i>Uh, look, I got some</i>
<i>critical information.

1207
01:31:51,429 --> 01:31:53,795
<i>You wanna call me from</i>
<i>a secure line?

1208
01:31:53,965 --> 01:31:55,262
No. Go ahead!

1209
01:31:55,700 --> 01:31:57,970
They made an arrest
on the Humvee drive-by.

1210
01:31:58,005 --> 01:31:58,869
<i>Names?

1211
01:31:58,904 --> 01:32:01,307
Nothing yet. Uh, they brought
in two suspects,

1212
01:32:01,342 --> 01:32:02,374
that's all I know.

1213
01:32:02,409 --> 01:32:04,544
<i>And I'm waiting for</i>
<i>a call from Zucker.

1214
01:32:04,579 --> 01:32:06,681
<i>I'll have something</i>
<i>in less than an hour.

1215
01:32:06,716 --> 01:32:08,115
You call me immediately.

1216
01:32:08,351 --> 01:32:10,979
<i>Alright. Will do.</i>
<i>Uh, and Paul?

1217
01:32:11,787 --> 01:32:12,754
What?

1218
01:32:13,089 --> 01:32:15,757
Uh, your niece called me
on my line.

1219
01:32:15,792 --> 01:32:17,895
It was forwarded from your phone
so I answered it.

1220
01:32:17,930 --> 01:32:19,955
I know how to handle that...

1221
01:32:20,933 --> 01:32:22,401
You know when to call me.

1222
01:32:22,836 --> 01:32:25,067
<i>I'll have something</i>
<i>in less than sixty.

1223
01:32:58,315 --> 01:32:59,908
- Hi.
- Are you okay?

1224
01:33:06,460 --> 01:33:09,328
Paul, this is Hassan's brother,
this is Joe.

1225
01:33:15,005 --> 01:33:17,099
You brought my brother home.

1226
01:33:17,308 --> 01:33:19,800
I am always grateful to you.

1227
01:33:21,013 --> 01:33:22,413
Well, you're welcome.

1228
01:33:23,450 --> 01:33:27,114
Well, uh, we're drinking some
really bad Vodka.

1229
01:33:27,355 --> 01:33:28,822
Will you join us?

1230
01:33:29,191 --> 01:33:30,091
Sure.

1231
01:33:30,126 --> 01:33:31,150
Alright! Come go!

1232
01:33:34,865 --> 01:33:36,265
Come in, come in, come in!

1233
01:33:38,002 --> 01:33:39,867
Paul, make yourself at home.

1234
01:33:40,338 --> 01:33:42,273
Please, have a seat on the couch...

1235
01:33:46,079 --> 01:33:49,140
Paul? It has been a long

1236
01:33:49,550 --> 01:33:55,457
discussion in my family,
whether "Aristocrat's Choice"

1237
01:33:56,193 --> 01:33:59,322
or lighter fluid is
easier to swallow.

1238
01:34:01,099 --> 01:34:04,832
And lighter fluid lost,
but not by much...

1239
01:34:12,414 --> 01:34:13,439
Cheers!

1240
01:34:35,979 --> 01:34:38,847
How, uh, how long has it been since
you talked to your brother?

1241
01:34:39,083 --> 01:34:40,414
Oh, yes...

1242
01:34:44,024 --> 01:34:46,322
Really, it'd been a long time!

1243
01:34:47,829 --> 01:34:49,263
You don't have a telephone?

1244
01:34:49,298 --> 01:34:52,131
No. Not any more.

1245
01:34:52,869 --> 01:34:54,837
How do you communicate from here?

1246
01:34:55,506 --> 01:34:59,273
Oh, there is one pay phone
adjoining the gas station.

1247
01:34:59,477 --> 01:35:01,173
But I get no calls.

1248
01:35:01,480 --> 01:35:03,107
Except from Henry.

1249
01:35:05,152 --> 01:35:07,053
Paul? Paul!

1250
01:35:08,223 --> 01:35:10,384
What have you been
doing all this time?

1251
01:35:11,025 --> 01:35:13,221
What do you think I've been doing?
I've been trying to...

1252
01:35:13,462 --> 01:35:15,226
learn some...

1253
01:35:15,599 --> 01:35:17,863
stuff about... Hassan.

1254
01:35:18,302 --> 01:35:19,394
I'll help you.

1255
01:35:20,338 --> 01:35:23,399
Anything I can tell you.
Anything I know.

1256
01:35:24,410 --> 01:35:26,401
Okay, well, uh...

1257
01:35:28,115 --> 01:35:29,640
who'd wanna kill him?

1258
01:35:31,219 --> 01:35:32,380
No one.

1259
01:35:32,588 --> 01:35:34,021
No one?

1260
01:35:34,423 --> 01:35:36,153
No, if...

1261
01:35:37,194 --> 01:35:41,565
if anyone knew Hassan,
had met Hassan...

1262
01:35:43,068 --> 01:35:45,128
They would wish him no harm.

1263
01:35:46,273 --> 01:35:48,868
Poor fellow had no possessions.

1264
01:35:49,110 --> 01:35:51,612
Nothing to eat,
nothing to steal...

1265
01:35:51,647 --> 01:35:55,106
He took a hollow point forty-four
right straight to the chest.

1266
01:35:55,218 --> 01:35:58,382
And that... that doesn't
exactly sound like a...

1267
01:35:58,589 --> 01:36:00,523
case of mistaken identity.

1268
01:36:01,026 --> 01:36:03,094
Paul, can I talk to
you for a second?

1269
01:36:03,129 --> 01:36:05,188
Look, if you...

1270
01:36:05,698 --> 01:36:07,394
you need to give me something.

1271
01:36:07,634 --> 01:36:09,626
If you want me to help you,

1272
01:36:10,071 --> 01:36:13,439
we, we can't play this
little game of riddles,

1273
01:36:14,343 --> 01:36:16,209
okay? Um,

1274
01:36:18,215 --> 01:36:20,376
what was he making
with the Borax?

1275
01:36:21,420 --> 01:36:23,514
Borax?

1276
01:36:26,427 --> 01:36:28,361
Money!

1277
01:36:28,462 --> 01:36:31,296
He was trying to
make money to eat.

1278
01:36:31,533 --> 01:36:33,434
Okay, well that, good!

1279
01:36:33,469 --> 01:36:36,006
I can understand that.
He was trying to turn a profit.

1280
01:36:36,041 --> 01:36:38,708
So, I'm gonna
need to know, uh,

1281
01:36:38,743 --> 01:36:42,645
the source, and I'll need to
know the buyers...

1282
01:36:42,680 --> 01:36:48,712
When the old factory shut down
I was able to borrow a truck.

1283
01:36:49,357 --> 01:36:53,692
And I loaded it with
many boxes of Borax.

1284
01:36:54,196 --> 01:36:56,757
Remind you,
I did not have permission...

1285
01:36:57,801 --> 01:36:59,393
Go on!

1286
01:37:00,739 --> 01:37:03,265
And Hassan, uh,

1287
01:37:04,777 --> 01:37:12,619
...he, uh, he found a company in
Los Angeles to, to keep it.

1288
01:37:13,088 --> 01:37:15,258
And, and he would
try to sell it

1289
01:37:15,293 --> 01:37:18,319
and, and, uh...

1290
01:37:18,629 --> 01:37:21,800
to other businesses and the
company would get some free boxes.

1291
01:37:21,835 --> 01:37:24,167
Free boxes to do what?

1292
01:37:24,803 --> 01:37:27,572
Oh, um, to clean their carpets.

1293
01:37:27,607 --> 01:37:30,668
They, uh, they imported these,
uh, carpets.

1294
01:37:38,255 --> 01:37:40,018
So, uh...

1295
01:37:42,727 --> 01:37:46,096
how was he...
what, what was he, uh,

1296
01:37:46,332 --> 01:37:50,438
to get... uh... expecting...
from... the other companies...

1297
01:37:50,473 --> 01:37:52,373
that he sold to?

1298
01:37:52,474 --> 01:37:54,066
I don't know.

1299
01:37:56,512 --> 01:37:59,812
Whoever would give him
a few goddamn dollars.

1300
01:38:02,353 --> 01:38:04,618
It's easier than selling cans.

1301
01:38:07,894 --> 01:38:09,384
What is that?

1302
01:38:10,597 --> 01:38:13,726
Oh, it's just a photo,
of Hassan.

1303
01:38:14,168 --> 01:38:15,727
Excuse me, please!

1304
01:38:22,480 --> 01:38:24,278
Hassan!

1305
01:38:25,718 --> 01:38:27,686
Will you please tell me
what's happening?

1306
01:38:27,920 --> 01:38:29,411
I don't know.

1307
01:38:32,627 --> 01:38:36,086
I, I'm just...
I, I'm not, uh...

1308
01:38:36,565 --> 01:38:39,091
I can't follow
the right leads...

1309
01:38:41,939 --> 01:38:45,468
Uh, uh...

1310
01:38:47,147 --> 01:38:48,479
You're okay?

1311
01:38:50,451 --> 01:38:53,717
I, I can't...
control it all, anymore.

1312
01:38:54,489 --> 01:38:56,787
My things,
these things that...

1313
01:38:56,959 --> 01:38:58,449
You don't have to.

1314
01:39:42,286 --> 01:39:43,514
Yeah.

1315
01:39:43,588 --> 01:39:44,953
<i>Go ahead?

1316
01:39:45,557 --> 01:39:46,757
Go ahead.

1317
01:39:46,792 --> 01:39:49,660
<i>It's not what we thought.

1318
01:39:52,333 --> 01:39:53,595
<i>Did you copy?

1319
01:39:54,836 --> 01:39:56,600
Yeah, I heard you.

1320
01:39:57,340 --> 01:40:00,043
<i>It was kids,</i>
<i>I just confirmed it.

1321
01:40:00,078 --> 01:40:01,840
Completely non-related.

1322
01:40:02,280 --> 01:40:03,804
<i>What do you mean, kids?

1323
01:40:04,482 --> 01:40:07,286
Zucker said they got
a legit confession.

1324
01:40:07,321 --> 01:40:08,777
Some random act...

1325
01:40:09,022 --> 01:40:10,957
<i>a couple of white kids.

1326
01:40:11,892 --> 01:40:13,622
A couple of white kids?

1327
01:40:13,862 --> 01:40:15,762
<i>Affirmative.

1328
01:40:19,837 --> 01:40:22,407
Where did, where'd they
get the Hummer?

1329
01:40:22,442 --> 01:40:23,635
<i>Parents.

1330
01:40:24,508 --> 01:40:26,610
Uh, they also got a
match on the gun

1331
01:40:26,645 --> 01:40:30,516
and Zucker said they tested
positive for Crystal Meth.

1332
01:40:30,551 --> 01:40:32,815
And one of them for Crack.

1333
01:40:33,287 --> 01:40:36,520
<i>Just bad kids, on drugs...

1334
01:40:39,094 --> 01:40:40,619
<i>What should I do now?

1335
01:40:43,601 --> 01:40:46,435
Listen. I got to, uh...

1336
01:40:47,807 --> 01:40:49,968
I, I'm... working on something.

1337
01:40:51,445 --> 01:40:53,037
I, I'll contact you later.

1338
01:40:53,415 --> 01:40:56,385
<i>Yeah. Okay.

1339
01:40:57,920 --> 01:40:59,684
Good work, Jimmy.

1340
01:40:59,823 --> 01:41:02,918
<i>Thanks, Paul. Uh, Serge.

1341
01:42:14,121 --> 01:42:14,985
Okay!

1342
01:42:21,965 --> 01:42:26,494
Oh, I can't believe
the situation... here...

1343
01:42:30,844 --> 01:42:31,970
Paul?

1344
01:42:33,915 --> 01:42:35,114
Oh my God, Uncle Paul!

1345
01:42:35,149 --> 01:42:36,852
- Uhuh.
- Come here! Are you okay?

1346
01:42:36,887 --> 01:42:38,787
Just, uh, minor injuries.

1347
01:42:40,122 --> 01:42:41,958
I'll take a butterfly...
stitch.

1348
01:42:41,993 --> 01:42:43,793
I'm getting you a wash cloth.

1349
01:42:45,863 --> 01:42:48,628
Leave the quack...
in the tent.

1350
01:42:50,536 --> 01:42:53,131
He couldn't stitch a baseball.

1351
01:42:54,842 --> 01:42:58,074
Oh, shit! Yeah.

1352
01:42:58,881 --> 01:43:04,150
That is... it's probably the...
worst day...

1353
01:43:35,128 --> 01:43:38,064
Shit! Oh, shit.

1354
01:43:40,035 --> 01:43:44,565
We're hot!
We're, we got hit on the left!

1355
01:43:45,309 --> 01:43:48,211
- Left side! Left side!
- Uncle Paul!

1356
01:43:48,246 --> 01:43:51,080
Pull it up, pull it up,
Little John! Pull it!

1357
01:43:51,350 --> 01:43:57,257
Ah! Pull it up, Little John!
Pull it up! We're gonna fucking dive!

1358
01:43:57,692 --> 01:43:59,159
You wanna mess with me, you...

1359
01:43:59,194 --> 01:44:03,133
Okay, let's go! Let's go,
you fucking, you fucking gooks!

1360
01:44:03,168 --> 01:44:05,870
Let's go! Come on,
you fucking little gooks!

1361
01:44:05,905 --> 01:44:08,738
Come on! Oh, no, my God,
we got flamed!

1362
01:44:08,941 --> 01:44:10,738
We got flamed in the bird.
What?

1363
01:44:11,009 --> 01:44:16,813
Shit! We're in deep shit!
In deep shit! Rip the belt! No!

1364
01:44:17,084 --> 01:44:19,679
Oh God! Don't!

1365
01:44:24,962 --> 01:44:29,298
No, don't. We're jumping.

1366
01:44:30,669 --> 01:44:35,574
Please, don't, don't, don't!

1367
01:44:39,414 --> 01:44:45,150
Help us, God, help us!
Help us in our helplessness.

1368
01:44:46,056 --> 01:44:48,960
Help my uncle in
II his pain and suffering.

1369
01:44:48,995 --> 01:44:50,929
Grant him peace!

1370
01:45:44,267 --> 01:45:45,700
Dear Paul.

1371
01:45:46,170 --> 01:45:49,368
If for nothing else, I hope you
can forgive me for this letter.

1372
01:45:50,008 --> 01:45:52,278
I have found myself
in an African hospital,

1373
01:45:52,313 --> 01:45:53,978
away from my home,

1374
01:45:54,013 --> 01:45:57,006
and all attempts to reach
you have been unsuccessful.

1375
01:45:57,084 --> 01:46:00,723
The doctors here tell me that
I am dying and I believe they are right.

1376
01:46:00,758 --> 01:46:02,091
We each have our last
day on this earth

1377
01:46:02,126 --> 01:46:04,178
and I have always been okay with that,

1378
01:46:04,213 --> 01:46:06,285
but of course I wish
I had more time.

1379
01:46:06,320 --> 01:46:08,357
Enough, at least,
to come find you.

1380
01:46:08,767 --> 01:46:10,633
Since that doesn't seem possible,

1381
01:46:10,668 --> 01:46:12,500
I am giving this letter to Lana.

1382
01:46:13,139 --> 01:46:15,570
She has grown into
a beautiful human being

1383
01:46:15,605 --> 01:46:18,002
and reminds me of Mom more
and more each day.

1384
01:46:18,113 --> 01:46:21,150
She seems to have gotten the
best parts from all of us and

1385
01:46:21,185 --> 01:46:23,119
hopefully none of the bad.

1386
01:46:23,520 --> 01:46:27,149
Aside from her father, you will
soon be her only living relative,

1387
01:46:27,891 --> 01:46:32,330
so when she brings you this,
there is one thing I ask of you...

1388
01:46:36,436 --> 01:46:38,997
You had a horrible
dream last night.

1389
01:46:42,077 --> 01:46:44,069
It really scared me.

1390
01:46:47,184 --> 01:46:48,344
I'm sorry.

1391
01:46:51,490 --> 01:46:53,754
You said that you were falling...

1392
01:46:57,298 --> 01:46:58,890
Do you remember?

1393
01:47:04,607 --> 01:47:06,974
That was the Huey I went down in.

1394
01:47:11,283 --> 01:47:13,183
We all fell...

1395
01:47:15,421 --> 01:47:17,913
Only two soldiers walked away.

1396
01:47:18,158 --> 01:47:19,785
I was one of 'em.

1397
01:47:22,631 --> 01:47:24,258
It's a gift.

1398
01:47:24,466 --> 01:47:25,900
A gift?

1399
01:47:28,004 --> 01:47:30,200
I'm not so sure about that...

1400
01:47:34,180 --> 01:47:35,841
It is to me.

1401
01:47:46,363 --> 01:47:49,959
That dream went away
for a long time.

1402
01:47:55,107 --> 01:47:58,305
And then, when that
plane hit the tower...

1403
01:47:59,512 --> 01:48:01,378
and then a second one,

1404
01:48:03,218 --> 01:48:05,278
but they were still there...

1405
01:48:08,158 --> 01:48:10,226
I was watching that shot of

1406
01:48:10,261 --> 01:48:13,663
the New York Skyline with
those beautiful towers.

1407
01:48:17,537 --> 01:48:24,103
They were burning inside,
but they just kept holding on.

1408
01:48:25,515 --> 01:48:27,142
Right there.

1409
01:48:30,488 --> 01:48:32,548
I, I knew it was bad.

1410
01:48:36,296 --> 01:48:39,288
Over two thousand
gallons of fuel,

1411
01:48:40,601 --> 01:48:43,298
two seven-sixty-sevens,

1412
01:48:47,043 --> 01:48:49,239
but I thought they
could handle it.

1413
01:48:56,188 --> 01:48:59,717
They took the blow and
they were standing strong,

1414
01:49:01,262 --> 01:49:03,197
and I thought:

1415
01:49:05,635 --> 01:49:07,569
They're refusing to fall!

1416
01:49:09,206 --> 01:49:11,141
They're too proud!

1417
01:49:14,413 --> 01:49:16,244
But then,

1418
01:49:21,322 --> 01:49:23,484
that dream just started
coming back.

1419
01:49:30,467 --> 01:49:33,266
I was so far away that
it was night time,

1420
01:49:34,339 --> 01:49:36,205
when the towers fell.

1421
01:49:39,413 --> 01:49:41,574
And at first, I didn't,

1422
01:49:42,017 --> 01:49:46,387
I didn't know what was going on...
I just heard people...

1423
01:49:47,556 --> 01:49:49,252
cheering.

1424
01:49:50,428 --> 01:49:52,055
Cheering?

1425
01:49:52,497 --> 01:49:54,398
There was a crowd

1426
01:49:55,167 --> 01:49:58,729
gathered out in the street.
Close to where we lived.

1427
01:50:00,508 --> 01:50:02,136
Terrorists!

1428
01:50:03,612 --> 01:50:05,240
No.

1429
01:50:08,452 --> 01:50:10,821
No, I think that that's the
part that hurts the most.

1430
01:50:10,856 --> 01:50:13,085
They weren't, they were just...

1431
01:50:15,660 --> 01:50:18,323
just ordinary people.

1432
01:50:20,500 --> 01:50:22,594
Well, why in the hell
were they cheering?

1433
01:50:25,441 --> 01:50:27,433
Because they hate us.

1434
01:50:30,281 --> 01:50:32,442
And because they hate America.

1435
01:50:36,222 --> 01:50:39,124
And it came from such
an honest place

1436
01:50:39,393 --> 01:50:43,558
and from so many people that...

1437
01:50:44,099 --> 01:50:47,434
I just, I knew that something
had gone wrong, and,

1438
01:50:48,438 --> 01:50:54,275
and that's, that's
become my... nightmare.

1439
01:50:55,914 --> 01:51:00,875
Over three thousand civilians
were killed on that day...

1440
01:51:01,387 --> 01:51:03,356
They were innocent people!

1441
01:51:05,460 --> 01:51:10,422
Yeah. And... and it's their
voices that I need to hear.

1442
01:51:13,304 --> 01:51:14,672
Because I really don't think
that they would want

1443
01:51:14,707 --> 01:51:17,403
any more people killed
in their name.

1444
01:52:00,500 --> 01:52:03,720
Aside from her father, you will
soon be her only living relative,

1445
01:52:03,755 --> 01:52:06,942
so when she brings you this,
there is one thing I ask of you.

1446
01:52:07,376 --> 01:52:10,540
Something I fear her father will
not be able to provide.

1447
01:52:10,781 --> 01:52:13,550
She is as courageous as a woman
her age can be,

1448
01:52:13,585 --> 01:52:16,919
but you and I both know life
has a way of changing that.

1449
01:52:17,389 --> 01:52:18,423
You, more than anyone,

1450
01:52:18,458 --> 01:52:21,895
know how everything can turn
upside down in a single moment.

1451
01:52:22,330 --> 01:52:24,630
I worry about the
times we live in,

1452
01:52:24,665 --> 01:52:28,432
and the world Lana will face
when she'll be our age.

1453
01:52:28,537 --> 01:52:31,306
One day I know she will
need real courage,

1454
01:52:31,341 --> 01:52:34,578
the kind of courage and strength
that only you may be able to teach her.

1455
01:52:34,613 --> 01:52:37,582
I'm so sorry I let our petty
differences come between us.

1456
01:52:37,617 --> 01:52:39,953
Only now do I realize how
absurd I've been.

1457
01:52:39,988 --> 01:52:42,323
I love you and I've always
loved you, Paul.

1458
01:52:42,358 --> 01:52:44,659
And when the day comes
that I see you again,

1459
01:52:44,694 --> 01:52:46,719
I will beg for
your forgiveness.

1460
01:52:46,929 --> 01:52:48,920
Until then, please watch
over your niece.

1461
01:52:49,331 --> 01:52:51,391
I'll be watching
over both of you.

1462
01:52:51,635 --> 01:52:54,571
My deepest love,
your sister Virginia.

1463
01:53:49,779 --> 01:53:51,838
You seem disappointed...

1464
01:53:52,783 --> 01:53:54,750
I thought it'd be different.

1465
01:53:56,153 --> 01:53:57,815
Like what?

1466
01:53:58,790 --> 01:54:00,656
Something more!

1467
01:54:03,162 --> 01:54:06,622
I don't know.
Not just a construction site.

1468
01:54:07,635 --> 01:54:09,763
Let's just be quiet!

1469
01:54:14,177 --> 01:54:16,510
Let's just try and listen...
