1
00:01:18,446 --> 00:01:20,346
Why in God's name...

2
00:01:20,448 --> 00:01:22,507
would the Stantons
have their summer house...

3
00:01:22,617 --> 00:01:24,482
out in the middle
of all this yuck?

4
00:01:24,586 --> 00:01:26,486
I don't think they do.

5
00:01:26,588 --> 00:01:28,488
What's that supposed to mean?

6
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:30,490
It means we're lost.

7
00:01:30,592 --> 00:01:33,493
We're just gonna keep driving
until we hit someone's pig?

8
00:01:33,595 --> 00:01:36,120
- Binky.
- How in God's name could you drag me down here...

9
00:01:36,231 --> 00:01:38,631
to Yuckville, West Virginia,
when I'm 40 months pregnant?

10
00:01:38,733 --> 00:01:40,724
<i>Not that that was my idea.</i>

11
00:01:40,835 --> 00:01:42,996
Don't start that again.
You agreed.

12
00:01:43,137 --> 00:01:45,264
Against my better judgment.

13
00:01:45,406 --> 00:01:48,136
Well, you will have your own
personal beach house to console you.

14
00:01:49,944 --> 00:01:53,311
Most husbands find it unnecessary
to bribe their wives to reproduce.

15
00:01:53,414 --> 00:01:56,281
That's why I "dwuv doo."

16
00:01:56,384 --> 00:01:59,945
God, haven't these people
ever heard of pavement?

17
00:02:00,054 --> 00:02:03,581
Huntsy. Something happened.

18
00:02:03,691 --> 00:02:06,251
What? What is it?

19
00:02:09,731 --> 00:02:12,199
I think the kid wants out
at the next stop.

20
00:02:17,939 --> 00:02:20,737
My wife is having a baby.
Where's the nearest hospital?

21
00:02:22,844 --> 00:02:26,143
You might try down in Jane Lew.

22
00:02:26,247 --> 00:02:28,943
How close are we?

23
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:33,383
I'd say about...

24
00:02:35,723 --> 00:02:38,658
<i>forty, forty-five miles.</i>

25
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,888
- Is he crazy?
- There's no time!

26
00:02:43,164 --> 00:02:45,394
Well...

27
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,230
the Hollowmade Hospital's
in Jupiter Hollow.

28
00:02:48,336 --> 00:02:50,270
It's about three miles, but...

29
00:02:50,371 --> 00:02:52,396
Hollowmade! Thank you!

30
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:54,974
How did you ever get me
out of Park Avenue?

31
00:02:55,076 --> 00:02:57,476
You ain't gonna get in there.

32
00:02:59,113 --> 00:03:01,104
Garth?

33
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:04,318
It's time again.

34
00:03:29,978 --> 00:03:32,674
Where do you want me
to put this, doc?

35
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:35,647
Just put it right here,
Eufus, on your way out.

36
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:38,719
Check with me tomorrow,
and don't worry about it.

37
00:03:43,925 --> 00:03:46,155
That's good cider, Nanny Lewis.

38
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,820
Could you take that
down to the lab?

39
00:03:55,203 --> 00:03:57,933
Snack time!

40
00:03:59,574 --> 00:04:02,873
<i>There's the hospital, Harlan.</i>

41
00:04:06,214 --> 00:04:08,774
- Cross your legs.
- Hunt!

42
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:12,477
Tell them I want my own room.

43
00:04:15,323 --> 00:04:17,450
My wife is having a baby.

44
00:04:17,558 --> 00:04:21,585
Well! Jane Lew Hospital's
probably what you're lookin' for.

45
00:04:21,696 --> 00:04:23,960
- This is a hospital?
- Yes.

46
00:04:24,065 --> 00:04:26,533
But it's for employees
of Hollowmade only.

47
00:04:26,634 --> 00:04:28,829
- Company policy.
- This is an emergency.

48
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:33,373
I'd love to help you out, but I can't do
anything without Mr. Stokes' authorization.

49
00:04:33,474 --> 00:04:35,442
- He's a real stickler...
- Mr. Stokes?

50
00:04:35,576 --> 00:04:37,601
He owns the Hollowmade factory.

51
00:04:37,745 --> 00:04:40,578
Lives in the big, gray
house, right over there.

52
00:04:41,649 --> 00:04:44,174
That's gratitude!

53
00:04:44,285 --> 00:04:46,185
I shan't be a minute.

54
00:04:46,287 --> 00:04:48,983
Hunt, where are you going?

55
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:50,990
Hunt? Hunt!

56
00:04:54,562 --> 00:04:56,792
You all right back there, lona?

57
00:04:56,898 --> 00:04:59,298
Don't you fret. I'm just fine.

58
00:05:00,401 --> 00:05:02,426
- Howdy, lona.
- Mornin', Jake.

59
00:05:03,905 --> 00:05:06,237
- Mr. Stokes!
- Doctor...

60
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:08,535
I'd like you to meet
Mr. and Mrs. Shelton.

61
00:05:08,643 --> 00:05:10,941
They're the new owners
of Hollowmade Furniture.

62
00:05:11,045 --> 00:05:13,843
Scrub up, Doc.
Your new boss is having a baby!

63
00:05:15,917 --> 00:05:19,114
<i>Look at this place. What a dump!</i>

64
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:21,211
<i>Hi, Doc.</i>

65
00:05:21,322 --> 00:05:25,190
Guess what?

66
00:05:33,101 --> 00:05:35,626
<i>I hate needles!</i>

67
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:38,432
Now, hold on a second.
It'll just be a little prick.

68
00:05:38,573 --> 00:05:42,407
Yeah, that's what got me
into this mess.

69
00:05:53,688 --> 00:05:55,679
It-It's a girl.

70
00:05:57,592 --> 00:05:59,685
Coming, lona.

71
00:06:03,531 --> 00:06:05,522
There you are.

72
00:06:12,673 --> 00:06:17,474
I like that lamp.
That new since last time?

73
00:06:17,578 --> 00:06:21,344
Yeah. One more push.

74
00:06:24,252 --> 00:06:26,152
It's a girl.

75
00:06:34,996 --> 00:06:38,295
It's another girl!

76
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:41,960
<i>Doctor! There's
something stuck in here!</i>

77
00:06:42,103 --> 00:06:45,561
<i>Nanny, I think you'd
better get in here quick.</i>

78
00:06:50,945 --> 00:06:53,209
<i>Nanny!</i>

79
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:07,321
It's another girl!

80
00:07:17,438 --> 00:07:19,736
Well, I hope you both
wanted twins...

81
00:07:19,841 --> 00:07:21,968
<i>'cause that's what you both got.</i>

82
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:24,009
<i>Girls!</i>

83
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:26,136
- Wonderful!
- Damn.

84
00:07:26,247 --> 00:07:28,408
That was the messiest,
ickiest...

85
00:07:28,516 --> 00:07:31,883
most unbearably primitive
experience I've ever had.

86
00:07:31,986 --> 00:07:34,955
If it's all right with you...

87
00:07:35,056 --> 00:07:38,389
I-I'd like to name them
after my great aunts.

88
00:07:38,492 --> 00:07:40,392
I shudder to ask.

89
00:07:40,494 --> 00:07:43,292
Rose and Sadie.

90
00:07:43,397 --> 00:07:46,366
You'll look so lovely
in that tiara.

91
00:07:46,467 --> 00:07:48,458
Tsk. All right.

92
00:07:48,569 --> 00:07:51,129
We'll name them Rose and Sadie.

93
00:07:51,272 --> 00:07:54,673
What color are the stones?

94
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:07,453
You done real good.

95
00:08:09,924 --> 00:08:12,358
Garth!

96
00:08:14,729 --> 00:08:18,324
Why, that's your "purtiest" one.

97
00:08:21,302 --> 00:08:24,794
Well, what should we call them?

98
00:08:26,841 --> 00:08:29,275
It's just a duck.

99
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:31,935
<i>You mean, the...</i>

100
00:08:35,082 --> 00:08:37,107
How about Rose and Sadie?

101
00:08:37,218 --> 00:08:39,914
That's "purty"!

102
00:08:40,021 --> 00:08:43,184
<i>Sadie and Rose.</i>

103
00:09:21,395 --> 00:09:23,295
<i>Good morning, Moramax.</i>

104
00:09:23,397 --> 00:09:25,627
<i>- Good morning. Hi, there.
- Thanks very much.</i>

105
00:09:25,733 --> 00:09:28,201
<i>Thank you. Miss Davis isn't in yet.</i>

106
00:09:28,302 --> 00:09:31,100
Would you take a seat
in the reception area?

107
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:36,836
<i>- Yes?
- She's coming.</i>

108
00:09:36,944 --> 00:09:40,573
It's Sadie!

109
00:09:40,681 --> 00:09:42,672
<i>Good morning,
Moramax. Please hold.</i>

110
00:09:42,783 --> 00:09:45,217
<i>Good morning, Moramax.
Please hold.</i>

111
00:09:45,319 --> 00:09:47,787
<i>Good morning, Moramax.</i>

112
00:09:53,861 --> 00:09:57,763
<i>- Good morning, Miss Shel...
- Depreciation schedule, on my desk by 5:00.</i>

113
00:09:57,865 --> 00:10:02,768
<i>Stuart. You know, when I ask for demographics,
I expect you to include all age groups.</i>

114
00:10:02,903 --> 00:10:06,270
- Children 7 to 13 don't purchase stock, Ms. Shelton.
- I did.

115
00:10:06,374 --> 00:10:08,774
<i>- Miss Shelton, the...
- Is this how we dress for the office?</i>

116
00:10:08,876 --> 00:10:11,310
- You look like a blood clot.
- Everything's ready for the board meeting.

117
00:10:11,412 --> 00:10:13,312
Flow charts.

118
00:10:13,414 --> 00:10:17,646
- Profit pyramid.
- I hope you'll be pleased. We were here until...

119
00:10:17,752 --> 00:10:21,085
What's going on in research?
More money for more lab rats?

120
00:10:21,188 --> 00:10:24,453
Some of our new products seem
to create, adverse reactions.

121
00:10:24,558 --> 00:10:26,753
Get tougher rats.

122
00:10:28,195 --> 00:10:30,629
<i>- Where's my sister?
- Not in yet.</i>

123
00:10:30,731 --> 00:10:34,360
- Dieting again, are we?
- Shhh. Not here.

124
00:10:36,504 --> 00:10:39,496
Good morning, Judy.
Come on, Duke.

125
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:42,575
- Hi, Rose.
- I know I'm late. It's just, I got to walking in the park...

126
00:10:42,676 --> 00:10:46,772
and it was so beautiful, and I, I found
this cute little guy and he was lost.

127
00:10:46,881 --> 00:10:49,509
- Rose.
- And I think I'm gonna call him Duke.

128
00:10:49,617 --> 00:10:52,518
- Because I've always wanted to have a dog named Duke!
- Let go, Rose.

129
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:55,180
- God! Duke! What have I done?
- Push the button.

130
00:10:55,289 --> 00:10:58,019
<i>- Call someone. Do something. Duke.
- The down button, Rose.</i>

131
00:10:58,125 --> 00:11:00,719
<i>- Help me! Call the security!
- It'll be all right.</i>

132
00:11:00,828 --> 00:11:03,456
<i>- Duke!
- See? There he is.</i>

133
00:11:03,564 --> 00:11:05,862
Duke, you're okay. I'm so sorry.

134
00:11:05,966 --> 00:11:08,457
I didn't mean to do it.

135
00:11:08,569 --> 00:11:11,538
It's all right. I deserve it.

136
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:14,540
Rose, why don't I take Duke
while you're in the meeting?

137
00:11:14,642 --> 00:11:17,475
The meeting. I almost forgot.

138
00:11:17,578 --> 00:11:20,604
I... I'm just not myself today.

139
00:11:20,714 --> 00:11:23,182
Or any other day.

140
00:11:27,555 --> 00:11:29,750
You're late. The meeting's
in two minutes.

141
00:11:29,857 --> 00:11:32,121
I know, but, Sadie,
do I have to go?

142
00:11:32,226 --> 00:11:35,718
I sit there, and everyone looks at me like
I... like I'm... because... especially today.

143
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:38,958
<i>I'm just not grounded. I'm not centered in
the way I should be, because last night...</i>

144
00:11:39,066 --> 00:11:41,432
Dr.Jay and I,
we were having this...

145
00:11:41,535 --> 00:11:44,368
This candlelight dinner
and, you know, too much wine.

146
00:11:44,505 --> 00:11:47,838
<i>I started opening up, and he started
closing up like he usually does.</i>

147
00:11:47,942 --> 00:11:50,877
But I started talking about
getting married and having kids...

148
00:11:50,978 --> 00:11:53,572
and maybe a goat
and some ducks...

149
00:11:53,681 --> 00:11:55,842
and a little garden
with fresh veggies.

150
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:59,113
<i>- You know how I love to chop and...
- What happened?</i>

151
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:02,485
- We broke up.
- Good riddance.

152
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:05,252
You are so completely out of sync.

153
00:12:05,359 --> 00:12:08,760
You're dreaming about growing old in the
country while other women your age...

154
00:12:08,863 --> 00:12:10,956
<i>- Our age.
- Don't interrupt!</i>

155
00:12:11,065 --> 00:12:15,434
Are thinking about tummy tucks. I tell you,
it's not normal. Now, stop it. Stop it.

156
00:12:15,536 --> 00:12:17,970
Do you want one of the board
members to see you?

157
00:12:18,072 --> 00:12:20,768
They'll say you're a sniveling,
hysterical, pre-periodic twit!

158
00:12:20,908 --> 00:12:23,934
I have a right to my own feelings,
Sadie, and I am not a twit.

159
00:12:24,078 --> 00:12:26,808
I may be pre-periodic,
and I may be hysterical. So what?

160
00:12:26,914 --> 00:12:29,354
So there are drugs for those things,
and we make most of them.

161
00:12:29,383 --> 00:12:31,613
I could just kick myself
when I act this way.

162
00:12:31,719 --> 00:12:34,449
Splash some water
on your face and maintain.

163
00:12:34,555 --> 00:12:37,388
- Rose!
- Dr.Jay for Rose.

164
00:12:37,491 --> 00:12:39,721
Put him on. Look, Jay...

165
00:12:39,827 --> 00:12:42,694
- Rose, Rose, I'm so glad I reached you.
- I'm not...

166
00:12:42,796 --> 00:12:46,254
I'm sorry, honey. It's not that I
haven't thought of the... the "M" word.

167
00:12:46,367 --> 00:12:49,894
I have. I have.
No, I maybe, might.

168
00:12:50,037 --> 00:12:52,471
It's just...
You know what it is?

169
00:12:52,606 --> 00:12:56,064
Well, I'll be honest with you.
It's your goddamned family!

170
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:59,407
The idea of your blood-sucking
sister Sadie...

171
00:12:59,513 --> 00:13:01,947
as a permanent
fixture in my life...

172
00:13:02,016 --> 00:13:04,314
is so inexpressibly nauseating...

173
00:13:04,418 --> 00:13:07,819
Well, take a purge.

174
00:13:07,922 --> 00:13:12,188
I'm just gonna throw myself
into your work. Who was that?

175
00:13:12,293 --> 00:13:14,488
A heavy breather
with intestinal woe.

176
00:13:14,595 --> 00:13:17,962
- Dear. Paw prints.
- Look, I'm fed up with you.

177
00:13:18,065 --> 00:13:19,965
You're a senior vice president...

178
00:13:20,067 --> 00:13:23,002
and the window washer knows more
about this company than you do.

179
00:13:23,137 --> 00:13:26,197
You're so wispy, wispy, wispy.
Why can't you focus?

180
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:28,900
- I'm going to.
- And these weird attacks of domesticity.

181
00:13:29,043 --> 00:13:31,102
- Where do they come from?
- I don't know.

182
00:13:31,245 --> 00:13:34,339
You're going to have to see Dr. Sullivan,
I insist. As soon as possible.

183
00:13:34,448 --> 00:13:38,282
- He didn't stop you from getting married.
- That was a brief fiasco.

184
00:13:38,385 --> 00:13:41,877
Well, this fiasco would like
to have a few words with you.

185
00:13:41,989 --> 00:13:43,980
- I tried to tell him.
- Hi, Michael.

186
00:13:44,091 --> 00:13:46,321
What are you doing here?
I'm going into a board meeting.

187
00:13:46,427 --> 00:13:48,622
Well, that's certainly
more important than your son.

188
00:13:48,729 --> 00:13:50,856
Yo, Ma. It's me, Sly.

189
00:13:50,965 --> 00:13:55,299
It's your day with him. You're not dumping
him on me five minutes before a meeting.

190
00:13:55,402 --> 00:13:58,235
I am not dumping him on you. I just
want to know the meaning of this.

191
00:13:58,372 --> 00:14:01,034
- He said you gave it to him.
- I did.

192
00:14:01,175 --> 00:14:04,008
- Do you mind telling me why?
- He earned it.

193
00:14:04,111 --> 00:14:06,011
How?

194
00:14:06,113 --> 00:14:08,673
A hundred dollars for every "C," two
hundred dollars for every "B"...

195
00:14:08,749 --> 00:14:12,276
You pay our child to learn?

196
00:14:12,386 --> 00:14:15,753
Why not?
Let's just call it a, a perk.

197
00:14:15,856 --> 00:14:20,520
You're out of your mind! You're
raising a child, not a, not a C.E.O.

198
00:14:20,628 --> 00:14:22,687
Well, perhaps I'll raise both.

199
00:14:22,796 --> 00:14:26,823
<i>I got you. I got you.</i>

200
00:14:26,934 --> 00:14:29,164
All right.
I'll take the money back...

201
00:14:29,303 --> 00:14:31,771
if you'll just...
get him out of here.

202
00:14:31,905 --> 00:14:34,567
Hey, that's my money! Mine!

203
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:37,074
Spoken like a true Shelton.

204
00:14:38,479 --> 00:14:41,209
<i>Jason!</i>

205
00:14:41,315 --> 00:14:43,374
Come along, Rose.

206
00:14:43,484 --> 00:14:46,476
I-I don't even know
what's on the agenda.

207
00:14:46,587 --> 00:14:49,385
There's a ridiculous little
company we've had forever.

208
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:52,618
- I'm going to ask the board to off-load it.
- What's it called?

209
00:14:52,726 --> 00:14:55,354
Hollowmade.

210
00:15:01,468 --> 00:15:05,404
Let's hear it for the Hollowmade
shop class and marching band!

211
00:15:05,506 --> 00:15:07,633
<i>Playing, well, frankly...</i>

212
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:09,675
I didn't recognize
the tune, but...

213
00:15:12,313 --> 00:15:14,406
Now, to head up this fight...

214
00:15:14,515 --> 00:15:18,349
we think we got somebody who's
more than a match for Moramax.

215
00:15:18,452 --> 00:15:20,920
<i>Hollowmade's
own factory foreman...</i>

216
00:15:21,021 --> 00:15:25,788
Miss Guts and Gumption, Miss
No-Nonsense herself, Rose Ratliff!

217
00:15:25,893 --> 00:15:29,590
<i>- Come on up here, girl!
- Yee!</i>

218
00:15:29,697 --> 00:15:32,427
<i>Come on, you spry chicken.</i>

219
00:15:32,533 --> 00:15:34,831
- Go get 'em, Rose!
- Think big, Rosie!

220
00:15:34,935 --> 00:15:39,235
<i>Thank you.</i>

221
00:15:39,373 --> 00:15:43,173
I appreciate that, Mayor.
I really do.

222
00:15:43,277 --> 00:15:46,212
I don't know about you all,
but I'm mad as a wet wasp.

223
00:15:46,347 --> 00:15:50,113
<i>I've been doing some checking up
on these Moramax folks.</i>

224
00:15:50,217 --> 00:15:54,813
Last year, they put 300 Santa Clauses out
of work, and right before Christmas too.

225
00:15:54,922 --> 00:15:57,686
<i>And now, it's Hollowmade
they want.</i>

226
00:15:57,791 --> 00:16:01,750
No tellin' what they got
up their designer sleeves.

227
00:16:01,862 --> 00:16:04,387
Could be condos, a ski resort.

228
00:16:04,498 --> 00:16:07,365
Strip-mining's one
sure thing comes to mind.

229
00:16:07,468 --> 00:16:11,404
Are we gonna let 'em swoop down on us like a
bunch of turkey buzzards in business suits?

230
00:16:11,538 --> 00:16:14,439
- No!
- Pick our bones clean?

231
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:17,942
- Take our factory, our jobs, our way of life?
- - No!

232
00:16:18,045 --> 00:16:20,605
Can we outsnake 'em? Hell, yeah!

233
00:16:23,751 --> 00:16:27,312
Now, go on and get out there and buy
those canned peaches and ceramic items.

234
00:16:27,421 --> 00:16:30,584
Mayor Finkar brought his two-headed
calf all the way up from Jane Lew.

235
00:16:30,691 --> 00:16:33,421
And it's a beauty.
Twenty-five cents a look.

236
00:16:33,527 --> 00:16:36,291
Come on, we got
to raise some money...

237
00:16:36,397 --> 00:16:40,163
so I can go up north and raise some
hell and kick some snooty New York ass.

238
00:16:43,904 --> 00:16:46,702
- Are you with me?
- Yeah!

239
00:16:46,807 --> 00:16:49,970
'Cause right here, right now,
we've got the Swamp Mud Boys...

240
00:16:50,077 --> 00:16:52,978
featurin' my sweet sister,
Miss Sadie Ratliff.

241
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:56,481
<i>Hit it!</i>

242
00:17:01,188 --> 00:17:04,646
. Well, hello, Jupiter Hollow
I know you're doin' fine.

243
00:17:04,758 --> 00:17:08,421
. Every day you work the factory
Every night, a jug of wine.

244
00:17:08,529 --> 00:17:10,429
. But now them bums at Moramax.

245
00:17:10,531 --> 00:17:12,431
. They're tryin' to milk us dry.

246
00:17:12,533 --> 00:17:15,195
. But you all knows my sister Rose
will sound the battle cry.

247
00:17:15,302 --> 00:17:16,860
Yee!

248
00:17:17,004 --> 00:17:20,804
. Sister Rose is gonna kick 'em
in their little-lo-lay-hee-hoo.

249
00:17:20,908 --> 00:17:23,570
<i>Their little-lo-lay-hee-hoo
Their little-lo-lay-hee-hoo.</i>

250
00:17:23,677 --> 00:17:27,579
. Every cent's gonna help us kick
their little-lo-lay-hee-hoo.

251
00:17:27,714 --> 00:17:31,480
. Hi-dee-olay-hee
Little-lo-lay-hee-hoo.

252
00:17:52,272 --> 00:17:54,797
<i>The most fiscally prudent action
at this point...</i>

253
00:17:54,942 --> 00:17:57,001
<i>is to divest ourselves
of Hollowmade.</i>

254
00:17:57,144 --> 00:17:59,374
It's a little backwoods
furniture factory.

255
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,812
They actually still make
porch rockers.

256
00:18:01,915 --> 00:18:05,078
<i>Now, the opportunities
for expansion are virtually nil...</i>

257
00:18:05,185 --> 00:18:08,211
and the buyer has offered us
a most attractive price.

258
00:18:08,322 --> 00:18:11,416
So you can see, gentlemen, that
were we to liquidate Hollowmade...

259
00:18:11,525 --> 00:18:15,291
the return on our investment
would in fact be quadrupled.

260
00:18:15,395 --> 00:18:18,990
<i>But liquidate...</i>

261
00:18:19,099 --> 00:18:22,762
<i>I mean, aren't there other considerations?
May I make a point?</i>

262
00:18:22,903 --> 00:18:25,804
I'm sitting listening here,
and I... what I...

263
00:18:25,906 --> 00:18:29,398
I'm feeling, deeply inside...

264
00:18:29,543 --> 00:18:31,704
I mean, what it is, is...

265
00:18:31,812 --> 00:18:34,781
I mean, things are just not
computing exactly right.

266
00:18:34,882 --> 00:18:36,747
<i>I mean... Sorry.</i>

267
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:39,751
Gentlemen,
help yourself to Danish.

268
00:18:39,853 --> 00:18:42,253
<i>God.</i>

269
00:18:42,356 --> 00:18:46,258
How many times have I told you you're not
to talk about things you don't understand?

270
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:49,261
- I know, but...
- Where do you get this bleeding heart from?

271
00:18:49,363 --> 00:18:52,264
I can't help it. I think the way Daddy
bought the company is so sweet.

272
00:18:52,366 --> 00:18:56,132
If Daddy were alive, he'd be the first to
agree with me. Sweetness wouldn't stop him...

273
00:18:56,236 --> 00:18:59,672
from taking a huge profit out of some
toothpick mill in Hickville, West Virginia.

274
00:18:59,806 --> 00:19:02,646
Now, eat the goddamn muffin. And for
God's sake, try to show some poise.

275
00:19:02,743 --> 00:19:04,643
<i>- Poise.
- Miss Shelton?</i>

276
00:19:04,745 --> 00:19:06,838
<i>- Yes?
- We're for it.</i>

277
00:19:06,947 --> 00:19:09,882
But we don't want
any publicity about it...

278
00:19:09,983 --> 00:19:14,352
<i>People losing
their jobs and all that.</i>

279
00:19:14,454 --> 00:19:17,480
<i>From a P.R. standpoint...</i>

280
00:19:17,591 --> 00:19:20,754
<i>we might look rather heartless
if we shut down the mill.</i>

281
00:19:20,861 --> 00:19:25,264
<i>Last year's hostile takeover of the
Santa City chain hurt us immeasurably.</i>

282
00:19:25,365 --> 00:19:28,562
<i>Everyone's
forgotten all about that.</i>

283
00:19:28,669 --> 00:19:31,137
I know I have.

284
00:19:31,271 --> 00:19:35,105
Three hundred angry Santas picketing our world
headquarters tend to be remembered vividly.

285
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:38,006
Yes, indeed they do.

286
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:41,945
Gentlemen, gentlemen. And Rose.

287
00:19:42,015 --> 00:19:44,745
<i>You have my full and complete
assurance that the buyer...</i>

288
00:19:44,851 --> 00:19:47,786
Mr. Fabio Alberici, will
continue running this factory...

289
00:19:47,888 --> 00:19:50,049
in concert
with current management.

290
00:19:50,157 --> 00:19:53,991
Therefore, I urge you to give your most
serious consideration to a "yes" vote...

291
00:19:54,094 --> 00:19:57,757
<i>to the Hollowmade sale initiative at
next Wednesday's stockholders' meeting.</i>

292
00:19:57,864 --> 00:20:00,765
So the people of Jupiter Hollow
are in support?

293
00:20:00,867 --> 00:20:05,167
They are! I assure you.

294
00:20:09,076 --> 00:20:12,910
Did you see that?

295
00:20:13,013 --> 00:20:16,278
Sadie, you were so good.
You got 'em singin' and dancin'.

296
00:20:16,383 --> 00:20:19,546
- That's gonna add plenty to the fund.
- The fund, the fund.

297
00:20:19,653 --> 00:20:22,713
- You sung so good, Sadie. Didn't she, Rose?
- She did.

298
00:20:22,823 --> 00:20:25,451
What's wrong with you? Don't you
want to save Jupiter Hollow?

299
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:30,462
I know it's small of me, but this doesn't strike
me as a way of life much worth preserving.

300
00:20:30,564 --> 00:20:33,897
Hey, Sadie! I got this
thing all wrapped up.

301
00:20:34,001 --> 00:20:37,164
I'm gonna get that little squealer
right there just for you.

302
00:20:37,304 --> 00:20:40,364
- Great, Petey!
- Yeah? Wanna go get a grape soda?

303
00:20:40,507 --> 00:20:44,238
Not with a man covered with pig poop.
No, sir, I don't.

304
00:20:44,344 --> 00:20:48,508
I'm not good enough for you? You're gettin'
a little above your raisin', if you ask me.

305
00:20:48,615 --> 00:20:51,106
She's just kiddin', Petey.
That's sure the truth.

306
00:20:51,218 --> 00:20:53,311
You been above your raisin'
all your life.

307
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:55,650
- Mighty nice job, ladies.
- We're gonna win.

308
00:20:55,756 --> 00:20:58,850
How can you say this is a way of
life not much worth preservin'?

309
00:20:58,959 --> 00:21:02,122
Just look at this. How can you
not just love this place?

310
00:21:02,229 --> 00:21:04,390
God, Rose, I wish I knew.

311
00:21:04,498 --> 00:21:08,025
I, I feel like the real me is
all cooped up inside, you know?

312
00:21:08,135 --> 00:21:11,434
<i>And I want so many things.
I want designer clothes.</i>

313
00:21:11,571 --> 00:21:16,304
I want to see the world. I want a penthouse
in the sky and a maid to pick up after me.

314
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:19,573
I want to say things
like "keep the change."

315
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:22,240
God, sometimes I get so bored...

316
00:21:22,382 --> 00:21:25,146
I find myself just prayin'
for a U.F.O. sightin'.

317
00:21:25,252 --> 00:21:28,415
I'd stand here and I'd say, "Come and get me.
Come and get me."

318
00:21:28,522 --> 00:21:31,582
Yeah, well, you're bored 'cause
you got no sense of purpose.

319
00:21:31,692 --> 00:21:34,490
Why don't you help me
with this Moramax mess?

320
00:21:34,594 --> 00:21:37,586
Over my dead...
What do you mean?

321
00:21:37,698 --> 00:21:41,134
Leave town? Go to New York City?

322
00:21:41,234 --> 00:21:45,170
- It's a dangerous, dirty, low-down place, Sadie.
- I know! I know!

323
00:21:45,272 --> 00:21:48,207
My God! What'll I wear?
I gotta get my hair cut.

324
00:21:48,308 --> 00:21:51,175
This is just
the sense of purpose I need.

325
00:21:51,278 --> 00:21:54,372
I gotta get me some of those press-on nails.
Do those things stay on?

326
00:21:54,481 --> 00:21:58,042
I wouldn't want 'em floppin' off
in any of those fancy nightclubs.

327
00:21:58,151 --> 00:22:01,314
Listen. Nightclubs? This is business.
Now, you get a grip on yourself.

328
00:22:01,421 --> 00:22:04,413
We're goin' to New York City!
We're goin' to New York City!

329
00:22:04,524 --> 00:22:08,426
What are you gonna tell Roone?

330
00:22:08,528 --> 00:22:10,428
I don't know.

331
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:13,556
Just keep your eye on the ball.

332
00:22:24,277 --> 00:22:28,043
Yeah! Hey, how's my baby?

333
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:34,687
If I can birdie the windmill hole this year,
I got a good chance of winnin' the Masters.

334
00:22:34,788 --> 00:22:37,655
- Look at that!
- Hoo! You see that?

335
00:22:37,758 --> 00:22:41,660
- Isn't that somethin'?
- When this tournament's over, I'm gonna take you away for a week.

336
00:22:41,762 --> 00:22:44,993
I'm gonna take you up to the
tiptop of Blue Ridge Mountain.

337
00:22:45,098 --> 00:22:48,124
- It might be more like the Empire State Building.
- What?

338
00:22:48,235 --> 00:22:51,204
No, you're not gonna get me
in no New York City.

339
00:22:51,304 --> 00:22:54,637
For a while there, I was worried they were gonna
send you to New York during the tournament.

340
00:22:54,741 --> 00:22:57,869
- Listen.
- Hey, without my good luck charm, I'd be sunk.

341
00:22:57,978 --> 00:23:00,538
Listen, Roone, I have
to tell you something.

342
00:23:00,647 --> 00:23:03,480
Wait, wait. I got a
surprise for ya.

343
00:23:03,583 --> 00:23:06,450
Goodness.

344
00:23:06,553 --> 00:23:09,716
- What is this?
- It's a real golf ball, miniaturized down.

345
00:23:09,823 --> 00:23:12,917
<i>I saw it in Big Putts magazine.
And if I win this tournament...</i>

346
00:23:13,026 --> 00:23:15,620
I'm gonna replace it
with a real diamond.

347
00:23:15,729 --> 00:23:19,324
- Well...
- Marry me, baby.

348
00:23:19,432 --> 00:23:23,027
Roone...

349
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:25,297
God.

350
00:23:31,945 --> 00:23:33,845
He just doesn't understand me.

351
00:23:33,947 --> 00:23:36,040
So what happened?
What'd you say?

352
00:23:36,149 --> 00:23:38,140
I told him I'd let him know.

353
00:23:38,251 --> 00:23:41,171
- You didn't tell him you were gonna miss his tournament?
- No, I did not.

354
00:23:41,254 --> 00:23:43,984
It's bad enough breaking his heart
without throwin' his game off.

355
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:45,990
- Mornin', Mayor.
- Mornin', ladies.

356
00:23:46,092 --> 00:23:49,152
Come on, Duke. Get your tail out
of that truck, you big ol' baby!

357
00:23:49,262 --> 00:23:52,823
Here, let me help you. Feels like
you packed your whole damn closet.

358
00:23:52,933 --> 00:23:57,302
- How long you plannin' to stay for, anyway?
- For as long as I can.

359
00:23:57,437 --> 00:24:01,032
- What do you mean by that?
- I mean I'm not comin' back.

360
00:24:01,174 --> 00:24:04,041
Are you crazy? Does Hilda know?
Does Winona?

361
00:24:04,144 --> 00:24:07,504
No, and don't you tell 'em, either, or I'll
tell Roone you're missin' his tournament.

362
00:24:07,547 --> 00:24:10,277
You a heart the size
of an unsoaked pinto bean.

363
00:24:10,383 --> 00:24:13,045
I oughta fit right in
in New York.

364
00:24:13,153 --> 00:24:16,281
Mama and Papa would've
been so proud of you.-!

365
00:24:16,389 --> 00:24:19,119
Don't carry all your money
in one place.

366
00:24:19,226 --> 00:24:22,127
- Don't go into the subways.
- Don't talk to any strangers.

367
00:24:22,229 --> 00:24:24,288
- No. No.
- Or eat clams.

368
00:24:24,397 --> 00:24:27,093
Auntie Sadie, will you
bring me back a surprise?

369
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:31,364
Li'l Levon.
You know I wouldn't forget you.

370
00:24:39,312 --> 00:24:42,941
Now, what's that all about?
We're gonna see you in two days.

371
00:24:43,049 --> 00:24:46,143
- Come on, let's go. Bye, everyone.
- Okay, you go, you go.

372
00:24:46,253 --> 00:24:48,244
<i>- Get in the truck.
- Bye-bye!</i>

373
00:24:48,355 --> 00:24:50,880
- Good luck!
- Bye!

374
00:24:50,991 --> 00:24:54,392
Take care! Hurry home!

375
00:24:54,494 --> 00:24:57,054
Yee!

376
00:25:26,693 --> 00:25:30,595
<i>Well, first of all, I thought I'd
show you this year's annual report.</i>

377
00:25:30,697 --> 00:25:32,858
<i>The photo of you two is great.</i>

378
00:25:32,966 --> 00:25:35,457
My God! How did I get so fat?

379
00:25:35,568 --> 00:25:38,230
I look like a walleyed salmon!

380
00:25:38,371 --> 00:25:41,067
What did he use,
a wide-angle lens?

381
00:25:41,207 --> 00:25:44,005
<i>No, he didn't. See, I look thin.</i>

382
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:48,171
<i>I-I mean I look thin. I mean, I
was sitting near the window.</i>

383
00:25:48,281 --> 00:25:50,476
- There was a lot of light.
- I know what you mean.

384
00:25:50,583 --> 00:25:54,542
I don't understand how it is that you can
stuff your face and nothing happens...

385
00:25:54,654 --> 00:25:56,815
and I subsist
on 60 calories a day...

386
00:25:56,923 --> 00:25:59,153
or else blow up
like a Macy's Day float.

387
00:25:59,259 --> 00:26:01,090
Do you mind?

388
00:26:01,194 --> 00:26:03,185
Now we're not going
to Greenwich tonight.

389
00:26:03,296 --> 00:26:05,264
The stockholders'
meeting is at the Plaza.

390
00:26:05,365 --> 00:26:08,698
Get us our usual suite.
By the way, Rose...

391
00:26:08,802 --> 00:26:11,737
<i>Fabio Alberici
is flying in today.</i>

392
00:26:11,838 --> 00:26:16,138
Sadie, you know, I know that I'm
not that good at figures, but...

393
00:26:16,242 --> 00:26:19,643
I mean, if we can't make a profit,
what makes him think he can?

394
00:26:19,746 --> 00:26:22,579
That's his problem.

395
00:26:22,649 --> 00:26:26,983
This deal is not closed yet, so I think we
should trot on out to the airport and greet him.

396
00:26:27,087 --> 00:26:29,920
Italians love meaningless
gestures of respect.

397
00:26:30,023 --> 00:26:32,924
- Makes them feel...
- virile.

398
00:26:33,026 --> 00:26:35,119
<i>What are you laughing at?</i>

399
00:26:35,228 --> 00:26:37,526
<i>- This is another crank letter.
- From whom?</i>

400
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:40,827
This R. Ratliff person
from Jupiter Hollow.

401
00:26:40,934 --> 00:26:44,165
<i>I've written him all sorts of soothing letters,
but he insists on coming up with his sister...</i>

402
00:26:44,304 --> 00:26:48,707
to, "raise some hell and kick some snooty
New York ass at the stockholders... ".

403
00:26:48,842 --> 00:26:51,242
Why didn't you show me this?

404
00:26:51,344 --> 00:26:53,312
What if he actually shows up?

405
00:26:53,446 --> 00:26:56,779
I mean, this is just the kind of
hysterical intrusion I don't want.

406
00:26:56,883 --> 00:26:58,817
A couple of moist-eyed
bumpkins...

407
00:26:58,918 --> 00:27:00,852
making an impassioned
plea to save their...

408
00:27:00,954 --> 00:27:03,718
<i>Well, the board is suspicious
enough as it is. -Suspicious...</i>

409
00:27:03,823 --> 00:27:05,723
of what?

410
00:27:05,825 --> 00:27:10,524
Nothing. I have a job for you.

411
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:14,031
<i>A Harvard MBA for this? How are we
supposed to find these Ratliff people?</i>

412
00:27:14,134 --> 00:27:17,103
Who do I look like to you?
Nancy Drew? I mean, really!

413
00:27:17,203 --> 00:27:19,569
Now, listen. These Ratliffs
are absolute hicks.

414
00:27:19,706 --> 00:27:23,608
<i>- There should be no problem in finding them at all.
- Taxi!</i>

415
00:27:23,743 --> 00:27:26,769
- Over here, taxi!
- Chuck? Chuck!

416
00:27:29,082 --> 00:27:31,209
- Where did you go?
- I'm in the cab.

417
00:27:31,317 --> 00:27:33,285
Harlan, stay to the right.

418
00:27:33,386 --> 00:27:36,514
Who're you kiddin'? I haven't got lost
since the day the two of you were born.

419
00:27:36,623 --> 00:27:40,787
- And that was at least...
- We know how many years ago that was, Harlan. Just drive.

420
00:27:40,894 --> 00:27:44,057
Where do we find
the suitcases, Rose?

421
00:27:44,164 --> 00:27:47,895
- Here. Look. Over here, Sadie. Over...
- Okay. All right.

422
00:27:48,001 --> 00:27:50,663
Look at my glove.

423
00:27:50,804 --> 00:27:53,671
- My God.
- Here, stick with me. Come on, now, stick with me.

424
00:27:53,773 --> 00:27:56,813
<i>- You're going the wrong way.
- What's the holdup here? I'm late for a flight.</i>

425
00:27:56,843 --> 00:27:59,277
- Rose! Rose!
- Stay with me.

426
00:28:02,382 --> 00:28:04,577
- Wait here.
- Thank you, Harlan.

427
00:28:12,959 --> 00:28:15,553
<i>- Here you are, Mr. Alberici.
- Grazie.</i>

428
00:28:15,662 --> 00:28:18,995
<i>Grazie, signore. Arrivederci
e buono giornata. Grazie.</i>

429
00:28:23,903 --> 00:28:29,398
<i>Great. He's early.
Well, who looks Italian?</i>

430
00:28:38,184 --> 00:28:40,652
I don't know you foreigners.

431
00:28:44,557 --> 00:28:48,220
I hope we didn't miss him.

432
00:28:48,328 --> 00:28:51,058
- Bus number 79 to Roosevelt Parkway.
- Come on, Rose.

433
00:28:51,164 --> 00:28:53,598
- 182 to Kew Gardens.
- The heck with that, Rose.

434
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:56,032
I'm in New York.
I wanna act like a New Yorker.

435
00:28:56,136 --> 00:28:58,730
<i>Sadie, hold on! Hold on, now.</i>

436
00:28:58,872 --> 00:29:00,806
Hold on!

437
00:29:00,907 --> 00:29:03,034
- He al...
- My God!

438
00:29:03,176 --> 00:29:05,576
- I don't know what I'm gonna do...
- Rose and Sadie?

439
00:29:05,678 --> 00:29:08,442
<i>At last we meet.</i>

440
00:29:08,548 --> 00:29:10,607
Do we know you?

441
00:29:10,717 --> 00:29:14,084
I am Fabio Alberici.

442
00:29:14,187 --> 00:29:16,417
<i>Graham Sherbourne told me
to look for you.</i>

443
00:29:16,523 --> 00:29:18,684
But you are not easy to find.

444
00:29:18,791 --> 00:29:23,888
<i>They wouldn't let me park.
I had to keep circlin'and circlin'.</i>

445
00:29:23,997 --> 00:29:27,592
Did-Did you go and buy
yourselves brand-new outfits?

446
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:29,827
How'd you know?

447
00:29:29,936 --> 00:29:32,302
Come over here a second.

448
00:29:34,507 --> 00:29:39,001
- Wow, what's goin' on?
- That Graham Sherbourne who wrote us those shuck and jive letters.

449
00:29:39,145 --> 00:29:41,773
<i>I bet he sent this fella
over here to soft-soap us.</i>

450
00:29:41,881 --> 00:29:44,748
- But how'd they know when we were comin' in?
- Are you kiddin'?

451
00:29:44,851 --> 00:29:48,582
Computer chips. They got their ways.
We better be on guard.

452
00:30:03,770 --> 00:30:06,170
<i>Sadie, don't you dare.</i>

453
00:30:06,272 --> 00:30:11,175
For once in my life, I'm gonna be Joan
Collins, and you're not gonna stop me.

454
00:30:14,948 --> 00:30:18,440
Don't think we're always
gonna be this easy.

455
00:30:18,551 --> 00:30:21,315
Perhaps we should
discuss business later.

456
00:30:21,421 --> 00:30:23,321
Fine with me.

457
00:30:23,423 --> 00:30:25,323
I just don't understand it.

458
00:30:25,425 --> 00:30:28,326
I spoke to everyone
wearing an Armani suit.

459
00:30:32,165 --> 00:30:35,362
<i>That must be he.</i>

460
00:30:36,903 --> 00:30:40,066
- My!
- What the hell is Harlan doing?

461
00:30:43,142 --> 00:30:47,636
Gee, these press-on nails. I guess
I should've pressed harder?

462
00:30:51,618 --> 00:30:55,076
You want
the air conditioning on?

463
00:30:55,188 --> 00:30:59,750
It's not n-necessary for me.

464
00:30:59,859 --> 00:31:02,089
I don't know if...

465
00:31:07,367 --> 00:31:11,030
<i>- Don't touch.
- I just wanted to feel it.</i>

466
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:13,764
- God, you are so bossy.
- Be quiet.

467
00:31:21,748 --> 00:31:24,478
Will one of you
get the damn phone?

468
00:31:34,761 --> 00:31:36,160
Hello?

469
00:31:36,262 --> 00:31:38,492
Glad I got you.

470
00:31:38,598 --> 00:31:42,830
Which would you prefer
in your room, roses or tulips?

471
00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:46,531
- Roses.
- Rose is me!

472
00:31:46,673 --> 00:31:48,573
Thank you.

473
00:31:48,675 --> 00:31:52,076
It was one of those surveys.

474
00:31:54,781 --> 00:31:58,979
Well, I'm utterly humiliated.
How could Harlan do this to us?

475
00:31:59,085 --> 00:32:01,986
Look at this. Not enough
to get two blocks.

476
00:32:02,088 --> 00:32:05,455
- Well, for God's sake, don't tell him that.
- He'll understand.

477
00:32:05,558 --> 00:32:09,824
<i>Driver, we're a little
short on cash, and I...</i>

478
00:32:11,664 --> 00:32:15,122
Hi.

479
00:32:15,234 --> 00:32:18,169
What is this hideous compulsion
you have to be honest?

480
00:32:18,271 --> 00:32:20,171
I-I don't know. I'm so sorry.

481
00:32:20,273 --> 00:32:25,176
Now, we are going to walk
very casually, and yet very quickly.

482
00:32:29,082 --> 00:32:32,176
Rose, it's just so cosmopolitan.

483
00:32:34,287 --> 00:32:36,414
Isn't it excitin'?

484
00:32:36,522 --> 00:32:39,286
<i>Yeah.
The noise, the smog, the crowds...</i>

485
00:32:39,392 --> 00:32:42,793
<i>the muggers, sex fiends, white
slavers, politicians... it's a pistol.</i>

486
00:32:42,895 --> 00:32:46,763
<i>I got about as much use for it
as a toad has for spit curls.</i>

487
00:32:46,866 --> 00:32:52,304
You Americans are...
Are so funny.

488
00:32:56,642 --> 00:32:58,667
Thank you.

489
00:33:12,058 --> 00:33:13,753
P.U.!

490
00:33:39,085 --> 00:33:43,988
What's goin' on?
What're we doin' here?

491
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:47,150
I don't know, but don't
take your eye off your suitcase.

492
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:48,989
Signorine?

493
00:33:57,837 --> 00:34:00,203
Wine and cheese.

494
00:34:00,306 --> 00:34:02,137
Good morning.

495
00:34:02,241 --> 00:34:04,300
Welcome to the Plaza.

496
00:34:04,444 --> 00:34:06,344
Right this way.

497
00:34:25,465 --> 00:34:28,992
Come on, Sadie. Quit gawkin'.

498
00:34:31,370 --> 00:34:34,396
I hope we will be seeing
each other soon.

499
00:34:52,158 --> 00:34:54,058
Here we are.

500
00:34:57,697 --> 00:35:01,599
It looks just like
the White House.

501
00:35:03,703 --> 00:35:06,763
Yeah, and I bet the CIA's
in the basement too.

502
00:35:06,906 --> 00:35:11,138
Look, let's level with each other.
Who's payin' for this room?

503
00:35:11,244 --> 00:35:13,474
The arrangements were made
through Moramax.

504
00:35:13,579 --> 00:35:15,740
<i>Is everything all right?</i>

505
00:35:15,882 --> 00:35:19,909
- No, it's not all right, because...
- Rose..

506
00:35:20,019 --> 00:35:22,681
But I guess it'll do.

507
00:35:22,788 --> 00:35:25,757
We oughta cancel our
reservations at the "Y."

508
00:35:33,332 --> 00:35:35,459
Testing, one, two, three.

509
00:35:35,568 --> 00:35:38,469
Look, a sink in the livin' room.

510
00:35:38,604 --> 00:35:41,903
That's what the French
call... a "bidet."

511
00:35:45,511 --> 00:35:47,445
The French must be
taller than me.

512
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:52,449
It's me. Wasn't there supposed
to be a gift basket in this room?

513
00:35:52,552 --> 00:35:55,487
<i>- Will there be anything else, ma'am?
- That's not ours.</i>

514
00:35:55,588 --> 00:36:00,321
- It's not?
- Golly, no. I wish it was!

515
00:36:12,038 --> 00:36:13,938
Wow, what a room!

516
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:16,838
What do you mean you've
given our suite to someone else?

517
00:36:16,943 --> 00:36:20,845
I-I don't know if we did.
The key's not here.

518
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:24,143
I want to speak to the manager.

519
00:36:29,188 --> 00:36:31,088
Rose, look at this!

520
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:33,954
Red wine and cheeses
of the world!

521
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:37,257
And look! Real wooden hangers.

522
00:36:37,363 --> 00:36:40,355
<i>But they don't come off.</i>

523
00:36:40,466 --> 00:36:43,867
"Here's to another great year
for you and Moramax. Graham."

524
00:36:44,003 --> 00:36:46,938
<i>- Who's Graham?
- Graham Sherbourne.</i>

525
00:36:47,073 --> 00:36:49,769
He's the pinstriped trouser
snake sent us those letters...

526
00:36:49,909 --> 00:36:53,037
and that big car and this room
and now this basket of goodies.

527
00:36:53,145 --> 00:36:57,013
He's just tryin' to buy us off.
Well, we are not impressed.

528
00:36:59,118 --> 00:37:02,645
<i>They got the cutest little
soaps in the shape of swans.</i>

529
00:37:02,755 --> 00:37:04,950
Could you die?

530
00:37:05,057 --> 00:37:07,890
I want our room,
and I want it now!

531
00:37:09,996 --> 00:37:12,487
Yes, ma'am, I can give you
the suite right next door.

532
00:37:12,598 --> 00:37:15,499
It's identical. I'll have the bellboy
take up your luggage.

533
00:37:15,601 --> 00:37:18,570
What luggage? It's evaporated!

534
00:37:18,704 --> 00:37:22,504
No. There it is.

535
00:37:34,387 --> 00:37:37,447
I feel like my stay here
is already ruined.

536
00:37:37,556 --> 00:37:39,649
Enjoy your stay.

537
00:37:39,759 --> 00:37:42,990
I just know we're gonna have
the most marvelous time.

538
00:37:49,535 --> 00:37:51,435
Lunch.

539
00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:54,801
Thank you. That was
the Hollowmade factory.

540
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:57,534
All I could find out is
that they've already left.

541
00:37:57,677 --> 00:38:00,441
My God!
They may already be here.

542
00:38:00,546 --> 00:38:03,845
I mean, what are we gonna do?
Call every hotel in New York?

543
00:38:03,949 --> 00:38:08,409
I wish to God I'd never heard of Neptune
Gulch, wherever the hell it is.

544
00:38:10,189 --> 00:38:12,248
Hi, everybody.
Chick Hearn here...

545
00:38:12,358 --> 00:38:15,327
with ESPN's coverage of
the 26th annual Mini-Masters.

546
00:38:15,428 --> 00:38:17,862
It's a gorgeous day
for professional putt-putt...

547
00:38:17,963 --> 00:38:20,864
<i>and we've got ourselves
a real barn burner.</i>

548
00:38:20,966 --> 00:38:23,696
<i>Let's look at the leader board. In the first
round, our leader is Roone Dimmick...</i>

549
00:38:23,803 --> 00:38:26,397
<i>who's heading for the 12th hole
with a two-shot lead...</i>

550
00:38:26,539 --> 00:38:28,439
<i>six under par.</i>

551
00:38:28,541 --> 00:38:31,237
<i>Now let's go to the 12th hole
and meet another member...</i>

552
00:38:31,343 --> 00:38:33,811
<i>of our ESPN broadcast crew,
Ian Churchill.</i>

553
00:38:33,946 --> 00:38:35,345
<i>Ian.</i>

554
00:38:35,448 --> 00:38:37,439
<i>Mr. Dimmick here
is being most thoughtful...</i>

555
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:39,609
<i>at club selection
on his par-three tester.</i>

556
00:38:39,719 --> 00:38:42,279
<i>The Windmill, or perhaps
the Hole of Lamentation to him...</i>

557
00:38:42,388 --> 00:38:45,789
<i>has plagued Mr. Dimmick throughout
his otherwise stellar career.</i>

558
00:38:45,891 --> 00:38:48,155
<i>He's now finished
studying the lie...</i>

559
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:51,957
<i>and positions himself
as a hush falls over the crowd.</i>

560
00:38:52,064 --> 00:38:56,262
<i>Roone! Hi there, Roone!
We're rootin'for ya!</i>

561
00:38:56,368 --> 00:39:00,998
Hi, Winona! Hey, where's Rose?

562
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:05,008
Well, personally, I think
she should've told you herself.

563
00:39:05,111 --> 00:39:07,011
Told me what?

564
00:39:07,113 --> 00:39:11,573
Well, this morning, she and Sadie
just up and went to New York.

565
00:39:13,919 --> 00:39:17,821
<i>- Ladies and gentlemen, just a second.
- Roone, what're you doin'?</i>

566
00:39:17,923 --> 00:39:21,323
<i>- It looks like Roone Dimmick is walking off the course.
- Roone, where are you going?</i>

567
00:39:25,664 --> 00:39:27,928
Lordy, it's high!

568
00:39:28,033 --> 00:39:31,025
Well, Rose, I'm going
to get my legs waxed.

569
00:39:31,170 --> 00:39:34,071
Are you coming? Or are you
just going to hole up here...

570
00:39:34,173 --> 00:39:37,631
and pretend you're wafting
through a field of poppies?

571
00:39:37,777 --> 00:39:41,304
You go ahead. I'm going to the library.
I have some reading to do.

572
00:39:41,413 --> 00:39:43,938
<i>Sadie. About that factory.</i>

573
00:39:44,049 --> 00:39:49,009
Rose, if you can't trust your
own sister, who can you trust?

574
00:39:49,121 --> 00:39:51,555
Darling girl.

575
00:39:54,126 --> 00:39:56,856
Rose, it is so gorgeous up here!

576
00:39:56,962 --> 00:40:00,489
It makes me dizzy. Well, I am gonna
go find that Mr. Sherbourne.

577
00:40:00,599 --> 00:40:04,865
I am gonna dip him in flour and
let him fry in his own grease.

578
00:40:05,004 --> 00:40:08,440
- Are you comin'?
- No, I think I'll just go for a walk, if that's okay with you.

579
00:40:08,574 --> 00:40:10,474
Well, here. Wait a minute.

580
00:40:10,576 --> 00:40:13,170
Don't go off without
a "Save Jupiter Hollow" button.

581
00:40:13,279 --> 00:40:15,338
All right, Rose. If you insist.

582
00:40:37,436 --> 00:40:39,597
<i>Hold the door.</i>

583
00:40:39,738 --> 00:40:42,571
<i>Hold the door! Hold the door!</i>

584
00:40:42,675 --> 00:40:44,575
Moron.

585
00:40:48,581 --> 00:40:51,675
Excuse me. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

586
00:40:51,784 --> 00:40:54,344
- Is everything satisfactory now?
- My, yes!

587
00:40:54,453 --> 00:40:58,651
That is some room! Have you
seen the view from up there?

588
00:40:58,724 --> 00:41:03,024
- No. I've never been above the third floor.
- You haven't?

589
00:41:03,128 --> 00:41:05,596
Well, you just gotta
come up there and see it.

590
00:41:05,698 --> 00:41:08,360
- That's very nice of you.
- No.

591
00:41:08,467 --> 00:41:11,868
It would be such a shame
not to share it.

592
00:41:12,004 --> 00:41:15,405
And I bet it's just
so beautiful at night.

593
00:41:15,507 --> 00:41:18,670
Well... bye.

594
00:41:18,777 --> 00:41:20,870
I'll see you later.

595
00:41:26,719 --> 00:41:29,688
<i>Well, buongiorno.</i>

596
00:41:29,788 --> 00:41:33,121
Would you care
to join me for a drink?

597
00:41:34,927 --> 00:41:37,088
That's not really my style.

598
00:41:37,196 --> 00:41:41,098
You know, you are not
making this very easy for me.

599
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:44,101
Is there any reason on Earth
why I should?

600
00:41:44,203 --> 00:41:47,229
I guess this is going to be
a difficult negotiation.

601
00:41:47,373 --> 00:41:52,310
I cannot imagine what you think
we're negotiating for.

602
00:41:52,444 --> 00:41:56,278
I thought it was understood.

603
00:41:56,382 --> 00:42:00,113
<i>Really?</i>

604
00:42:02,288 --> 00:42:04,483
Eurotrash.

605
00:42:15,401 --> 00:42:19,701
I thought I'd just go
for a walk, if that's okay.

606
00:42:19,838 --> 00:42:23,239
You, walk?!

607
00:42:23,375 --> 00:42:26,037
Well, this I gotta see.

608
00:42:35,487 --> 00:42:38,854
Hello.

609
00:42:38,958 --> 00:42:42,223
Can you tell me what room
Fabio Alberici is in?

610
00:42:42,328 --> 00:42:44,353
Yes, he's in room... 1402?

611
00:42:44,463 --> 00:42:47,330
But if you're looking for him,
he's right over there.

612
00:42:49,435 --> 00:42:52,495
My God.
He must think I'm insane.

613
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,540
By the way...

614
00:42:56,642 --> 00:43:01,011
I thought the delay when we
first checked in was inexcusable.

615
00:43:18,063 --> 00:43:20,224
What cute dogs!

616
00:43:20,332 --> 00:43:22,232
Hello.

617
00:43:26,305 --> 00:43:29,297
- No you don't.
- Well, it makes no difference to me.

618
00:43:29,441 --> 00:43:32,376
I'm getting paid
whether you ride or not.

619
00:43:32,511 --> 00:43:34,479
Suit yourself.

620
00:43:38,851 --> 00:43:41,786
What the hell are they doin'?
Are they crazy?

621
00:43:41,887 --> 00:43:44,583
I should've quit
this damn job years ago.

622
00:43:47,459 --> 00:43:50,223
Harlan! Harlan! Harlan!

623
00:43:50,329 --> 00:43:52,957
Harlan!

624
00:43:53,065 --> 00:43:56,228
That happened to me once.

625
00:44:08,981 --> 00:44:12,417
<i>- Well, buongiorno.
- Buongiorno.</i>

626
00:44:12,518 --> 00:44:16,750
- You have changed your mind.
- I feel absolutely ridiculous.

627
00:44:16,855 --> 00:44:19,449
Of course, I should've
known who you were.

628
00:44:19,558 --> 00:44:21,526
You must meet a lot of people.

629
00:44:21,627 --> 00:44:25,085
There was such a mix-up at the airport.
I still don't know what happened.

630
00:44:25,197 --> 00:44:27,358
<i>It's already forgotten.</i>

631
00:44:27,466 --> 00:44:30,094
Campari and soda.

632
00:44:30,202 --> 00:44:33,171
Well, business.

633
00:44:33,305 --> 00:44:38,208
My geologists have given me the plans for
the strip-mining of your Jupiter Hollow.

634
00:44:38,310 --> 00:44:41,541
But first tell me,
would you have any objection...

635
00:44:41,647 --> 00:44:45,083
to us making
our transaction in yen?

636
00:44:45,184 --> 00:44:49,348
Laundering some lira, are we?

637
00:44:49,455 --> 00:44:52,913
The Japanese are so discreet.

638
00:44:53,025 --> 00:44:56,324
Well, tell me. Who buys
and sells money for you?

639
00:44:56,428 --> 00:44:58,328
<i>Jack Butler.</i>

640
00:44:58,430 --> 00:45:00,921
Jack? I went to Yale with Jack.

641
00:45:01,033 --> 00:45:04,366
I did my first
hostile takeover with Jack.

642
00:45:04,503 --> 00:45:06,937
No!

643
00:45:10,742 --> 00:45:13,506
Hi, Rose. How's Duke doing?

644
00:45:13,612 --> 00:45:15,773
Duke? My dog?

645
00:45:15,881 --> 00:45:19,112
Boy, when you go snoopin'
into people's lives...

646
00:45:19,218 --> 00:45:21,345
you don't miss a trick, do ya?

647
00:45:21,453 --> 00:45:24,013
I'm sorry.

648
00:45:24,123 --> 00:45:26,717
I'm here to see
Graham Sherbourne.

649
00:45:26,825 --> 00:45:28,884
Okay. He should be
in his office.

650
00:45:28,994 --> 00:45:31,462
And where is that?

651
00:45:31,563 --> 00:45:33,861
Well, where it usually is, Rose.

652
00:45:35,367 --> 00:45:38,200
<i>You're a big help.</i>

653
00:45:39,972 --> 00:45:42,167
Hi, Rose.

654
00:45:42,307 --> 00:45:44,207
Hi.

655
00:45:44,309 --> 00:45:46,243
Hi, Rose.

656
00:45:46,378 --> 00:45:49,404
Hi. Hi, everyone.

657
00:45:49,515 --> 00:45:51,540
Just fine. Had a good breakfast.

658
00:45:51,650 --> 00:45:54,448
Oatmeal. But I guess
you know that.

659
00:45:56,155 --> 00:46:00,216
Got on my Tuesday panties,
but I guess you know that too.

660
00:46:00,325 --> 00:46:02,293
- My God, it's nearly time to go.
- There he is.

661
00:46:02,394 --> 00:46:05,761
Well, I know, but we have to get over
to the Plaza, for heaven's sakes.

662
00:46:05,864 --> 00:46:08,924
- You're right.
- Could I see your report tomorrow?

663
00:46:09,034 --> 00:46:11,901
- Hi, gentlemen. Hi.
- Well, what are you doing here?

664
00:46:12,037 --> 00:46:15,200
We were just on our way over to
the Plaza to see you and Sadie.

665
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:17,274
Is, everything okay?

666
00:46:17,409 --> 00:46:19,809
No, everything is not okay.

667
00:46:19,912 --> 00:46:22,574
We have to talk,
and we have to talk now.

668
00:46:22,681 --> 00:46:25,514
All right. What's the problem?

669
00:46:25,617 --> 00:46:30,384
What's the problem? Have you got your
brains and your balls in your briefcase?

670
00:46:30,489 --> 00:46:32,889
<i>Did she say "balls"?</i>

671
00:46:32,991 --> 00:46:36,427
- Wow.
- Let's just go in here and talk, quietly.

672
00:46:36,528 --> 00:46:40,624
You want some reassurances that it will
be business as usual at Hollowmade...

673
00:46:40,732 --> 00:46:42,632
<i>after the sale?</i>

674
00:46:42,734 --> 00:46:45,669
<i>- You know we can't do that.
- Well, you sure as hell better.</i>

675
00:46:45,771 --> 00:46:49,070
Or I'm gonna kick up a big ruckus
at the stockholders' meetin'.

676
00:46:49,174 --> 00:46:51,608
And I've said my piece. Amen.

677
00:46:51,710 --> 00:46:55,578
What are you talking about?
Does Sadie know how you feel?

678
00:46:55,647 --> 00:46:57,877
- Of course.
- Does she agree?

679
00:46:57,983 --> 00:47:01,214
Is a frog's ass watertight?

680
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:05,222
<i>Do you suppose it's hormonal?</i>

681
00:47:05,324 --> 00:47:07,224
Who cares? We're off the hook.

682
00:47:07,326 --> 00:47:10,159
How about some racquetball, and
where should we go for dinner?

683
00:47:10,262 --> 00:47:14,062
Please, please. Let me just coast
for a few precious moments...

684
00:47:14,166 --> 00:47:16,760
without having to make
any decisions.

685
00:47:43,228 --> 00:47:46,629
I wanna go down to the South Street Seaport.
Do you go that way?

686
00:47:46,732 --> 00:47:49,257
Step on it, please.

687
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:43,288
<i>Guten Morgen.</i>

688
00:49:03,075 --> 00:49:06,476
- Out of the way, bitch!
- Wha... Wa... Wait!

689
00:49:13,318 --> 00:49:15,616
I'd like a mint julep, please.

690
00:49:49,988 --> 00:49:51,888
No you don't!

691
00:50:28,126 --> 00:50:30,959
- Yo, Ma!
- Wha... What the heck did you do that for?

692
00:50:31,062 --> 00:50:34,156
- I just wanted to go the distance.
- Go the distance? You...

693
00:50:34,266 --> 00:50:36,359
- Get over here, you! Get over here!
- Hey!!

694
00:50:36,468 --> 00:50:38,749
- What are you doing?
- I'm gettin' you out of harm's way.

695
00:50:38,804 --> 00:50:42,137
<i>- Get off.
- Relax, squirt. I've tied hogs slipperier than you.</i>

696
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:44,299
I'm not a hog.

697
00:50:44,443 --> 00:50:48,243
- Boy, you are hell on wheels!
- Well, what do you expect?

698
00:50:48,346 --> 00:50:52,612
- Are you responsible for this?
- His mother spoils him rotten.

699
00:50:52,717 --> 00:50:57,620
Well, she's a damn fool.
He's a disaster area.

700
00:50:57,722 --> 00:51:00,953
<i>- You don't really mean that?
- Yes I do.</i>

701
00:51:01,059 --> 00:51:04,358
I'm very sorry. But you know,
it's never too late.

702
00:51:05,964 --> 00:51:08,262
Now, if you'll both excuse me...

703
00:51:08,366 --> 00:51:12,132
I must be getting back
to the... Plaza Hotel.

704
00:51:12,270 --> 00:51:14,795
<i>Come back? Where you going?</i>

705
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:18,239
- Wait! Your money.
- It's my money!

706
00:52:16,201 --> 00:52:18,101
<i>Ya-hoo!</i>

707
00:52:22,274 --> 00:52:25,175
That's Sadie Shelton.

708
00:52:25,277 --> 00:52:28,041
<i>How about an ice cream soda?</i>

709
00:52:28,146 --> 00:52:31,081
I'd rather have
the MP-60 rocket water gun.

710
00:52:31,182 --> 00:52:33,707
- How about an ice cream soda?
- Messages?

711
00:52:37,055 --> 00:52:40,149
And I get to keep the dollars
overseas, where they aren't taxable.

712
00:52:40,258 --> 00:52:43,250
And invest them
in a villa in Italy.

713
00:52:45,830 --> 00:52:48,355
But aren't Italian property values...

714
00:52:48,466 --> 00:52:51,264
a little... soft right now?

715
00:52:51,369 --> 00:52:55,897
No. Very hard.

716
00:53:02,914 --> 00:53:05,849
Hold that thought.

717
00:53:05,951 --> 00:53:09,216
Here's to our deliverance
from repugnant tasks.

718
00:53:09,321 --> 00:53:12,916
Here's to the Ratliffs,
wherever they are.

719
00:53:16,261 --> 00:53:19,788
What are the two of you doing
lazing around...

720
00:53:19,898 --> 00:53:23,356
guzzling Dom Perignon
on my expense account?

721
00:53:23,468 --> 00:53:26,494
This had better mean you found
those Ratliff people.

722
00:53:26,638 --> 00:53:29,163
But I thought
you changed your mind.

723
00:53:29,307 --> 00:53:32,572
What fantasy is this? Are we hearing
voices now, like Joan of Arc?

724
00:53:32,677 --> 00:53:36,738
- But, Rose said...
- No matter what bleeding heart sentiment my sister expressed...

725
00:53:36,848 --> 00:53:39,817
it has nothing to do
with what Moramax wants.

726
00:53:39,918 --> 00:53:42,944
Now, I want those people
found tonight.

727
00:53:43,054 --> 00:53:46,319
- Now?
- Now.

728
00:53:55,634 --> 00:53:58,797
This is for you from... Sly.

729
00:53:58,937 --> 00:54:00,837
Thank you.

730
00:54:25,764 --> 00:54:28,699
You intimidate
your subordinates so well.

731
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:32,236
Don't I, though?

732
00:54:32,370 --> 00:54:35,305
And what other
talents do you have?

733
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:39,467
Do you... dance, perhaps?

734
00:54:39,611 --> 00:54:42,876
Don't think this is going to affect
my judgment in the slightest.

735
00:54:42,981 --> 00:54:46,473
I'm planning to gouge you
on this sale.

736
00:54:46,584 --> 00:54:50,452
And I... to impale you.

737
00:54:54,693 --> 00:54:56,593
Thank you.

738
00:54:58,596 --> 00:55:02,225
- Try the "Y." Hicks always stay at the "Y."
- I just did.

739
00:55:02,333 --> 00:55:04,597
- And?
- They were going there, but they cancelled.

740
00:55:04,703 --> 00:55:07,433
Are you ready for this?
They're here.

741
00:55:11,076 --> 00:55:13,567
Where did you get it?

742
00:55:13,712 --> 00:55:17,546
- It's from somebody named Sly.
- It's a bribe.

743
00:55:17,649 --> 00:55:20,277
They want us
to keep our mouths shut.

744
00:55:20,385 --> 00:55:24,116
- How come?
- They've got to be up to somethin' terrible.

745
00:55:24,222 --> 00:55:28,352
- Wait until the stockholders hear about this.
- Do they have to?

746
00:55:28,460 --> 00:55:30,792
What do you mean?

747
00:55:30,895 --> 00:55:33,125
Well, just 'cause
we take a bribe...

748
00:55:33,231 --> 00:55:36,325
doesn't mean we have to
do what they say.

749
00:55:36,434 --> 00:55:41,371
Sadie Ratliff, sometimes I wonder
if we got the same blood.

750
00:55:41,473 --> 00:55:45,068
<i>My own sister. Damn.</i>

751
00:55:45,210 --> 00:55:48,611
I can't think how things
could get any worse.

752
00:56:01,826 --> 00:56:04,727
<i>They say the neon lights
are bright.</i>

753
00:56:04,829 --> 00:56:07,024
<i>On Broadway.</i>

754
00:56:09,501 --> 00:56:14,564
<i>They say there's always magic
in the air.</i>

755
00:56:17,776 --> 00:56:21,473
<i>But when you're walkin'
down that street.</i>

756
00:56:21,579 --> 00:56:25,447
<i>And you ain't had enough to eat.</i>

757
00:56:25,550 --> 00:56:29,111
<i>The glitter rubs right off.</i>

758
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:31,552
<i>And you're nowhere.</i>

759
00:56:41,833 --> 00:56:45,394
<i>They say the women
treat you fine.</i>

760
00:56:45,503 --> 00:56:49,234
<i>. On Broadway.</i>

761
00:56:49,374 --> 00:56:51,865
<i>But lookin'at them.</i>

762
00:56:52,010 --> 00:56:56,504
<i>Just gives me the blues.</i>

763
00:56:58,683 --> 00:57:00,514
<i>Doo.</i>

764
00:57:00,618 --> 00:57:03,587
- The Plaza.
- At the Plaza?

765
00:57:03,688 --> 00:57:07,522
- Where's the Plaza?
- 59th and Fifth.

766
00:57:11,095 --> 00:57:15,088
<i>On Broadway..</i>

767
00:57:16,634 --> 00:57:19,535
As soon as I get my shoes on,
I'm gonna take this evidence...

768
00:57:19,671 --> 00:57:22,504
and put it in the hotel safe.

769
00:57:24,776 --> 00:57:27,370
Fine by me.

770
00:57:29,848 --> 00:57:32,078
- Hello?
- Rose? Listen.

771
00:57:32,183 --> 00:57:35,414
Did you say anything to Chuck and Graham
about calling off the Hollowmade sale?

772
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:38,546
- Of course not.
- Well, they are totally inept.

773
00:57:38,656 --> 00:57:42,285
Look, I want you to go downstairs and
help them find these Ratliff people.

774
00:57:42,393 --> 00:57:44,520
Sadie, why can't you do it?

775
00:57:44,629 --> 00:57:49,123
Because Fabio has turned out
to be something of a... perk.

776
00:57:49,234 --> 00:57:52,135
I had plans
for the evening, Sadie.

777
00:57:52,270 --> 00:57:56,229
I know what your plans were. To hole up in
the room and make love to the pastry cart.

778
00:57:56,374 --> 00:57:59,207
Now put down that eclair
and get downstairs.

779
00:57:59,310 --> 00:58:01,141
Okay, Sadie.

780
00:58:10,355 --> 00:58:13,847
I want to put this
in the hotel safe, please.

781
00:58:13,958 --> 00:58:16,085
Rose Shelton, please.

782
00:58:17,528 --> 00:58:19,553
Thank you. Never mind.

783
00:58:19,664 --> 00:58:21,598
Excuse me. Rose!

784
00:58:21,699 --> 00:58:24,429
- Yes?
- I've been doing a lot of thinking.

785
00:58:24,535 --> 00:58:27,436
- We can fix this.
- What is this?

786
00:58:27,538 --> 00:58:30,063
- Open it.
- You're Sly.

787
00:58:30,208 --> 00:58:33,268
Sly... I don't know what you're talking
about. I couldn't be more sincere.

788
00:58:33,411 --> 00:58:35,345
Please. Another bribe?

789
00:58:35,446 --> 00:58:38,006
<i>Bri... If you don't want this,
what do you want?</i>

790
00:58:38,116 --> 00:58:41,017
If you think you can
buy me off with this!

791
00:58:41,119 --> 00:58:44,020
- Look, honey...
- Don't you touch me, and don't you call me honey...

792
00:58:44,122 --> 00:58:47,819
you no-good, belly-scrapin'
pile of cow plop!

793
00:58:47,926 --> 00:58:50,827
<i>- Come along.
- What's a cow plop, Mommy?</i>

794
00:58:50,929 --> 00:58:53,955
Obviously, you're still upset.

795
00:58:56,067 --> 00:58:59,002
You can't outsnake me.

796
00:59:06,678 --> 00:59:09,647
Excuse me.
I-Is this the Plaza Hotel?

797
00:59:09,781 --> 00:59:11,681
It's all yours.

798
00:59:16,287 --> 00:59:18,619
Hey.

799
00:59:18,723 --> 00:59:21,920
You stand here long enough,
you see yourself come out.

800
00:59:22,026 --> 00:59:24,392
- What?
- Yeah.

801
00:59:24,495 --> 00:59:26,793
There's two of everybody
in there.

802
00:59:47,418 --> 00:59:50,751
The ones on the top, and one of those cocoa
truffles with the little swirl on it.

803
00:59:55,626 --> 00:59:57,526
And...

804
00:59:57,628 --> 01:00:02,088
<i>I'll take two... no, give me three
of those pretty parfait nougats.</i>

805
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:04,100
Surprise!

806
01:00:04,202 --> 01:00:09,139
- Yes?
- I know I'm the last person you expected to see here...

807
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:11,800
and maybe you don't believe this,
but you're the gal for me...

808
01:00:11,943 --> 01:00:15,383
and I'm the guy for you, and we're gonna get
married and there ain't two ways about it.

809
01:00:15,513 --> 01:00:19,472
- Is this some kind of a joke?
- Is that all you can say?

810
01:00:19,584 --> 01:00:23,020
I heard you were up here, I come up all
this way, and you think it's a joke?

811
01:00:23,121 --> 01:00:26,249
You'll have to excuse me.

812
01:00:28,359 --> 01:00:32,887
Can you believe he actually tried
to buy me off with a diamond ring?

813
01:00:32,997 --> 01:00:37,297
I think I've earned a...
a few hours' sleep.

814
01:00:37,402 --> 01:00:40,838
<i>- Are you comin' to bed?
- 00.</i>

815
01:00:40,938 --> 01:00:44,704
Boy. I never thought I'd have
to wear this old thing again.

816
01:00:44,809 --> 01:00:48,301
<i>Sadie, that used to be
your favorite dress.</i>

817
01:00:48,446 --> 01:00:50,471
Yeah, well...

818
01:00:50,581 --> 01:00:53,709
- Where are you goin'?
- I'm goin' downstairs.

819
01:00:53,818 --> 01:00:58,312
I'm not gonna stick around here like a clove
on a baked ham. I'm gonna kick up my heels.

820
01:00:58,423 --> 01:01:01,119
They got dinin',
they got dancin', food, beverages.

821
01:01:01,225 --> 01:01:03,557
Shoot, I could stay right here
in this hotel the rest of my life...

822
01:01:03,661 --> 01:01:06,186
and be happy as Beulah the cow.

823
01:01:06,297 --> 01:01:09,266
<i>I thought you was gonna help me.</i>

824
01:01:09,367 --> 01:01:12,928
Ratliff, Ratliff. A man
and his sister from Jupiter Hollow.

825
01:01:13,037 --> 01:01:15,505
I'm telling you,
they're not here.

826
01:01:15,606 --> 01:01:18,040
They must be registered
under an assumed name.

827
01:01:18,142 --> 01:01:20,872
<i>- Graham? Graham.
- Graham?</i>

828
01:01:20,978 --> 01:01:22,912
<i>- Well, who's Graham?
- Rose?</i>

829
01:01:23,047 --> 01:01:25,743
- Hi, I'm Roone.
- I'm Graham.

830
01:01:25,850 --> 01:01:29,411
- This is Chuck.
- Howdy. Y'all from Moramax?

831
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:32,683
- Hi. Yes, yes, we are.
- Well, I'm from Jupiter Hollow.

832
01:01:32,790 --> 01:01:35,350
Jupiter Hollow?
I was born in Jupiter Hollow!

833
01:01:35,460 --> 01:01:37,360
And you're proud of it.

834
01:01:37,462 --> 01:01:40,329
Do you,
do you know the Ratliffs?

835
01:01:40,431 --> 01:01:43,093
Well, you're standin'
right in front of one of'em.

836
01:01:43,201 --> 01:01:46,364
Would you excuse us
for one minute?

837
01:01:46,504 --> 01:01:48,938
Jus-Jus... Rose.

838
01:01:52,443 --> 01:01:54,343
I've never seen
this person in my life.

839
01:01:54,445 --> 01:01:56,572
He mu... He must have seen
my picture in the annual report.

840
01:01:56,681 --> 01:02:00,014
- He calls himself "Roone"?
- He's "R. Ratliff."

841
01:02:02,120 --> 01:02:06,216
He's the factory foreman from Hollowmade.
This must be his perverse idea of having fun.

842
01:02:06,324 --> 01:02:08,451
Let's just humor him
until Sadie gets here.

843
01:02:08,559 --> 01:02:11,221
Do I have to?

844
01:02:11,329 --> 01:02:14,457
Roone...

845
01:02:14,565 --> 01:02:16,863
would you like
to join us for dinner?

846
01:02:16,968 --> 01:02:19,232
Well, that sounds
like a good idea.

847
01:02:19,337 --> 01:02:22,431
Yeah, I could use
a tuna fish sandwich.

848
01:02:27,178 --> 01:02:28,941
<i>Hi, there.</i>

849
01:02:29,013 --> 01:02:31,880
- Hello.
- Gee, you're still workin'?

850
01:02:31,983 --> 01:02:34,975
I bet you're lookin' forward
to gettin' off tonight?

851
01:02:35,086 --> 01:02:37,953
- I was...
- I wanna have some fun tonight.

852
01:02:38,055 --> 01:02:41,320
It's too early to go to bed.
You got any ideas?

853
01:02:42,693 --> 01:02:44,593
Maybe.

854
01:02:44,695 --> 01:02:46,595
Maybe I'll... see you around.

855
01:02:46,697 --> 01:02:49,530
Okay. I'll keep my eye
out for ya. Bye.

856
01:02:51,903 --> 01:02:56,306
So, you will not take back
any paper on the sale...

857
01:02:56,407 --> 01:02:59,274
even if I kickback a percent
of the strip-mining profits.

858
01:02:59,377 --> 01:03:03,871
Absolutely not.
I insist on total liquidation.

859
01:03:03,981 --> 01:03:07,280
Well, this evening cannot end
until we conclude our negotiation.

860
01:03:07,385 --> 01:03:10,320
Perhaps in my room?

861
01:03:10,421 --> 01:03:12,889
Let me get my messages.
I'll meet you upstairs.

862
01:03:12,990 --> 01:03:17,324
<i>I, I want to change into
something less... al dente.</i>

863
01:03:23,334 --> 01:03:27,065
Do you have any messages for me?

864
01:03:28,940 --> 01:03:33,343
One. I get off at 10:00, and I'd
love to see the view from your room.

865
01:03:33,444 --> 01:03:36,777
Well, we certainly
can look forward to that.

866
01:03:49,460 --> 01:03:53,123
Ma'am, could you put a little
more fire under this fish?

867
01:03:53,231 --> 01:03:55,563
Will ya, hon? I, I think I just
heard it holler, "Help!"

868
01:03:57,902 --> 01:04:00,427
Smooth. Very smooth.

869
01:04:01,973 --> 01:04:05,875
Excuse me.

870
01:04:06,010 --> 01:04:08,342
Well, what do y'all think
about Rose?

871
01:04:08,446 --> 01:04:12,075
She's quite a little beauty, isn't she?
Don't you be gettin' any ideas now.

872
01:04:16,220 --> 01:04:18,654
My God.

873
01:04:18,756 --> 01:04:20,656
Excuse us.

874
01:04:20,758 --> 01:04:22,658
I know.
I know it looks horrible.

875
01:04:22,760 --> 01:04:25,490
But we've got the culprit right
here. He's a professional.

876
01:04:25,596 --> 01:04:29,896
<i>Fake name. Totally ingenious, totally
prepared. He actually knew Rose by sight.</i>

877
01:04:30,001 --> 01:04:33,459
Don't you let him out of your sight until
after tomorrow's stockholders' meeting.

878
01:04:33,604 --> 01:04:36,767
Is that quite clear?

879
01:04:39,644 --> 01:04:43,375
What are we supposed to do,
immobilize him with a death ray?

880
01:04:43,481 --> 01:04:45,381
Let me think.

881
01:04:48,653 --> 01:04:50,780
Stop.

882
01:04:50,888 --> 01:04:54,847
I'm sorry. You know,
I know it seems strange...

883
01:04:54,959 --> 01:04:58,360
my comin' up all this way
from Jupiter Hollow like this.

884
01:04:58,462 --> 01:05:01,898
But, Rose, I love you.

885
01:05:01,999 --> 01:05:05,935
Why are you doing this to me?

886
01:05:06,037 --> 01:05:08,357
Well, from the first moment
I heard you were in New York...

887
01:05:08,439 --> 01:05:10,839
all that mattered to me
was findin' you.

888
01:05:10,941 --> 01:05:15,310
You can't be happy here.
I mean, the traffic alone.

889
01:05:15,413 --> 01:05:18,075
I just can't see you up here
in all this traffic.

890
01:05:18,182 --> 01:05:21,345
And the food. I mean, back home,
we'd use this stuff as bait.

891
01:05:21,452 --> 01:05:23,784
Look, I'm doing
just fine, really.

892
01:05:23,888 --> 01:05:27,085
I know. You'd do fine whatever
spot on earth they dropped you on.

893
01:05:27,191 --> 01:05:30,388
It's just... Rose, I know you.

894
01:05:30,494 --> 01:05:32,826
You don't belong
in New York City.

895
01:05:32,930 --> 01:05:35,398
It's in your eyes.
It's all over your face.

896
01:05:35,499 --> 01:05:38,525
You don't belong in that,
that suit.

897
01:05:38,636 --> 01:05:42,470
I mean, all this Moramax stuff is
just bleedin' the heart right out of ya.

898
01:05:42,606 --> 01:05:45,473
You know you want a whole other
kind of life than this.

899
01:05:45,576 --> 01:05:49,205
I-I've never told
that to a living soul.

900
01:05:49,347 --> 01:05:51,212
How did you know?

901
01:05:51,315 --> 01:05:55,411
Well, I know you.

902
01:05:55,519 --> 01:05:59,114
Tha-Tha-That's nothin' to cry about.

903
01:05:59,223 --> 01:06:02,715
Here. Here.

904
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:11,700
Thank you.

905
01:06:28,452 --> 01:06:30,420
Well, you're in America now.
Speak American.

906
01:06:30,521 --> 01:06:34,981
Y-Yes, but,
you are dressed to go out.

907
01:06:35,092 --> 01:06:38,892
Did you want to go out again,
or back upstairs?

908
01:06:38,996 --> 01:06:41,988
I was going to go back upstairs.

909
01:06:42,099 --> 01:06:43,999
Good.

910
01:06:45,636 --> 01:06:48,070
- Shall we?
- No!

911
01:06:48,205 --> 01:06:50,105
I can make it on my own.
You go right ahead.

912
01:06:50,207 --> 01:06:54,166
Of course.

913
01:06:56,213 --> 01:07:02,015
By the way, why don't you take
this, reading material now?

914
01:07:02,119 --> 01:07:05,111
Last thing I planned
to do tonight was read.

915
01:07:08,859 --> 01:07:10,759
Well.

916
01:07:17,635 --> 01:07:20,195
- Hi.
- You.

917
01:07:20,304 --> 01:07:23,364
You look almost...
almost wholesome.

918
01:07:23,507 --> 01:07:27,375
- What are you doing here?
- I wanted to talk to you.

919
01:07:27,478 --> 01:07:31,039
- Talk to me about what?
- About what you said aboutJason in F.A.O. Schwarz.

920
01:07:31,148 --> 01:07:36,711
I was impressed and amazed. It reminded
me of a... of a girl I used to know.

921
01:07:36,821 --> 01:07:41,815
Listen. I think we should
have lunch or something.

922
01:07:41,926 --> 01:07:44,622
Y-You want me
to have lunch with you?

923
01:07:44,728 --> 01:07:46,992
Well, I mean,
Jason too, if you want.

924
01:07:47,097 --> 01:07:50,464
Well, 'long as you keep him
bound and gagged.

925
01:07:54,638 --> 01:07:58,938
Well, we could talk more
easily if it's just the two of us.

926
01:08:01,378 --> 01:08:03,175
Okay.

927
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:07,216
What about, here?
Tomorrow, 2:00.

928
01:08:07,318 --> 01:08:10,378
Y-Yes. Ve-Very nice.

929
01:08:12,990 --> 01:08:15,686
I'll see ya.

930
01:08:18,095 --> 01:08:22,555
Friendly men in this town.

931
01:08:29,473 --> 01:08:31,373
<i>Have a good evening now.</i>

932
01:08:31,475 --> 01:08:33,466
Of course.

933
01:08:59,470 --> 01:09:02,132
Hey, babe.

934
01:09:02,273 --> 01:09:06,403
I used to be allergic to angora,
but I'm okay now.

935
01:09:18,956 --> 01:09:21,550
I love to see a woman
with a good appetite.

936
01:09:21,659 --> 01:09:24,423
You do?

937
01:09:24,528 --> 01:09:26,928
I feel obliged to point out to you...

938
01:09:27,031 --> 01:09:29,864
that this man is a con artist
of the first rank.

939
01:09:29,967 --> 01:09:33,232
- Maybe he isn't. How do you know?
- I...

940
01:09:33,337 --> 01:09:35,828
So where are you staying, Roone?

941
01:09:35,973 --> 01:09:40,205
Well, I ain't exactly stayin' anywhere. I just
got off the bus and come lookin' for you.

942
01:09:40,311 --> 01:09:45,408
Well, we have a whole suite.
Why doesn't Roone stay with us?

943
01:09:45,516 --> 01:09:48,110
No. I couldn't crowd you guys.

944
01:09:48,218 --> 01:09:50,118
We insist.

945
01:09:52,323 --> 01:09:56,259
You know, this meal has not
satisfied my appetite one iota.

946
01:09:56,360 --> 01:10:00,160
I got such a cravin' for some country
cookin', I'm gettin' downright homesick.

947
01:10:00,264 --> 01:10:03,290
Shameless.

948
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:08,633
Hell, I only been out
of Jupiter Hollow one day...

949
01:10:08,772 --> 01:10:10,706
but I sure do miss it.

950
01:10:10,808 --> 01:10:12,867
What do you miss about it?

951
01:10:13,010 --> 01:10:16,912
Well, my porch, for one thing.

952
01:10:17,047 --> 01:10:20,847
Nothin' like rockin' on
your porch around twilight time.

953
01:10:20,951 --> 01:10:25,411
Yeah, your bones
go as limp as a willow tree.

954
01:10:25,522 --> 01:10:28,889
And the shadow from the mountain
makes its way up my steps like...

955
01:10:28,993 --> 01:10:31,518
Well, like an old friend
comin' to visit.

956
01:10:31,629 --> 01:10:33,529
And the stars!

957
01:10:33,631 --> 01:10:36,429
I mean, that's about the only thing
crowded aboutJupiter Hollow.

958
01:10:36,533 --> 01:10:39,969
Right now, the sky'd be
plumb full of stars.

959
01:10:41,338 --> 01:10:45,206
You know. Kids playin'
in the schoolyard...

960
01:10:45,309 --> 01:10:48,472
doors with no locks...

961
01:10:48,579 --> 01:10:51,514
folks who look you straight
in the eye and smile.

962
01:10:51,615 --> 01:10:56,279
Yeah, people are as close as corn
there in Jupiter Hollow.

963
01:10:56,387 --> 01:10:59,550
You know, when Mother Nature
looks through her window...

964
01:10:59,657 --> 01:11:03,388
Jupiter Hollow is the view
that she loves best.

965
01:11:08,999 --> 01:11:12,162
The Colbyco board
has already approved the merger.

966
01:11:14,304 --> 01:11:16,864
Adam, have a glass of water, please.

967
01:11:17,007 --> 01:11:19,237
Give 'em hell, Alexis!

968
01:11:19,343 --> 01:11:21,971
Golly, look at her go. She is just
runnin' that whole company.

969
01:11:22,079 --> 01:11:25,276
Would you turn that damn thing
down? I'm tryin' to think.

970
01:11:25,382 --> 01:11:28,180
You have seen that episode
a thousand times.

971
01:11:28,285 --> 01:11:30,583
I just love it
when she fires everybody.

972
01:11:30,688 --> 01:11:33,350
<i>- I'm a very direct woman.
- I'm a very direct woman.</i>

973
01:11:33,457 --> 01:11:37,587
If I do not get your approval...
And please understand...

974
01:11:37,695 --> 01:11:41,756
that I have controlling interest
in Denver-Carrington...

975
01:11:41,865 --> 01:11:44,425
I shall fire you all
on the spot...

976
01:11:44,535 --> 01:11:47,197
and replace you with a board
that will approve the merger.

977
01:11:48,906 --> 01:11:52,273
- What's this?
- Somethin' that guy from the airport gave me.

978
01:11:52,376 --> 01:11:56,904
My God.

979
01:11:57,014 --> 01:11:59,539
<i>- What's the matter?
- My God.</i>

980
01:12:10,327 --> 01:12:13,763
Just, just a minute.

981
01:12:16,300 --> 01:12:20,999
- Roone.
- How could I go to sleep without kissin' you good night first?

982
01:12:27,478 --> 01:12:29,343
Good night, darlin'.

983
01:12:29,446 --> 01:12:33,439
No one's ever called me
"darlin" ' like that before.

984
01:12:33,550 --> 01:12:36,246
Well, I should hope not.

985
01:12:37,588 --> 01:12:40,489
Look. I want you to keep this.

986
01:12:41,725 --> 01:12:44,023
- And...
- No, no.

987
01:12:44,128 --> 01:12:46,096
- Please don't fuss.
- Roone, I...

988
01:12:46,196 --> 01:12:48,460
I couldn't. I...

989
01:12:48,565 --> 01:12:51,898
Well, I better go nows.

990
01:12:54,571 --> 01:12:56,971
Good night, sweetheart.

991
01:12:58,075 --> 01:13:00,839
Good night.

992
01:13:10,387 --> 01:13:13,845
Don't blame me. Don't blame me.
You're the one who lost him.

993
01:13:13,957 --> 01:13:16,482
Well, he just bolted
for the elevator.

994
01:13:16,593 --> 01:13:20,495
<i>What was I supposed to do,
wrestle him to the ground?</i>

995
01:13:29,439 --> 01:13:31,339
Roone.

996
01:13:34,511 --> 01:13:37,139
Sure is nice you boys
lettin' me bunk here.

997
01:13:37,247 --> 01:13:39,147
Hey, that's classical music,
isn't it?

998
01:13:41,418 --> 01:13:44,251
Yes. Yes, it is.

999
01:13:44,354 --> 01:13:47,551
Yeah, I could tell. No lyrics.

1000
01:14:03,240 --> 01:14:06,266
So, what do you think
of my plans?

1001
01:14:06,410 --> 01:14:10,176
Fabio, you fiend!

1002
01:14:10,280 --> 01:14:13,772
<i>.I'm in the mood for love.</i>

1003
01:14:13,884 --> 01:14:16,284
<i>- Simply because you're near me.
- My God!</i>

1004
01:14:16,386 --> 01:14:19,116
He is not a Ratliff.
His name is Roone Dimmick.

1005
01:14:19,223 --> 01:14:22,852
He's traveling with $25,
no credit cards and a harmonica.

1006
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:25,241
<i>- Will you look at this quilt?
- .I'm in the mood for love.</i>

1007
01:14:25,295 --> 01:14:28,458
<i>- The workmanship!
- .Simply because.</i>

1008
01:14:29,933 --> 01:14:31,833
. You're near me.

1009
01:14:31,935 --> 01:14:35,530
. An... Hey, I like your kimono.
Get that in 'Nam?

1010
01:14:36,740 --> 01:14:40,642
No, Fire Island.

1011
01:14:41,912 --> 01:14:44,312
Well, let's all
have a drinky, shall...

1012
01:14:45,515 --> 01:14:48,109
<i>No, I think it's time
for beddy-bye.</i>

1013
01:14:50,921 --> 01:14:52,718
Chuck.

1014
01:14:52,823 --> 01:14:56,281
Good night, Roone.

1015
01:14:59,897 --> 01:15:03,492
Don't tell me you two guys are
sleepin' in the same bed together.

1016
01:15:04,768 --> 01:15:08,363
- Yes.
- Gee, I feel awful about that.

1017
01:15:08,505 --> 01:15:12,601
Now if you want, one of you can take
the couch, and I'll share the bed.

1018
01:15:12,743 --> 01:15:17,680
That... That's very generous of
you, but, we wouldn't hear of it.

1019
01:15:17,814 --> 01:15:21,807
You guys are all right.

1020
01:15:45,242 --> 01:15:47,870
Wow.

1021
01:16:08,031 --> 01:16:10,727
<i>How's the traffic out there
this morning, Joanna?</i>

1022
01:16:10,834 --> 01:16:13,928
<i>Well, we're starting out with the Long
Island Expressway bumper to bumper.</i>

1023
01:16:14,037 --> 01:16:16,232
<i>I am upset. There's only
an hour till the meeting...</i>

1024
01:16:16,373 --> 01:16:18,500
<i>and we don't have a chance
of finding these people!</i>

1025
01:16:18,642 --> 01:16:22,806
<i>- Keep your voice down.
- We are not going to find the Ratliffs.</i>

1026
01:16:22,913 --> 01:16:25,177
<i>Is that all that's botherin'
you, is findin'the Ratliffs?</i>

1027
01:16:25,282 --> 01:16:27,807
Do you know where they are?

1028
01:16:27,918 --> 01:16:31,752
Sure. Just let me finish my Pop-Tarts
here, and I'll take you right to 'em.

1029
01:16:35,759 --> 01:16:39,593
- Mornin', Rose.
- Mornin', Sadie. You're late.

1030
01:16:39,696 --> 01:16:42,893
- I already ordered.
- Good. Grapefruit.

1031
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,366
Can you believe these guys?

1032
01:16:45,469 --> 01:16:47,369
<i>First they bribe us
to keep our mouths shut...</i>

1033
01:16:47,504 --> 01:16:49,504
<i>then they hand us
a complete copy of their plans...</i>

1034
01:16:49,639 --> 01:16:52,574
and if that isn't bad enough, they
got the nerve to charge $12.50...

1035
01:16:52,676 --> 01:16:54,940
for four tiny little pancakes.

1036
01:16:55,045 --> 01:16:56,910
Come on, Rose.
Rose, come on now.

1037
01:16:57,014 --> 01:17:00,142
Look. You got your butter in the shape of a
goldfish, and you got your choice of syrups.

1038
01:17:00,250 --> 01:17:03,879
And I know how you like to mix and match those
syrups, and... Look, they got boysenberry.

1039
01:17:04,988 --> 01:17:08,253
Sadie. Damn, good bread.

1040
01:17:08,358 --> 01:17:12,226
Rose! Look!

1041
01:17:12,329 --> 01:17:15,628
All over my brand-new
polyester jacket.

1042
01:17:15,732 --> 01:17:17,927
Quick. Do something. Well,
go on and hurry and change.

1043
01:17:18,035 --> 01:17:20,026
I guess so. Okay.

1044
01:17:22,873 --> 01:17:24,773
Lord, my load is heavy.

1045
01:17:57,674 --> 01:18:00,040
Good. A grapefruit.

1046
01:18:00,143 --> 01:18:04,011
- Where did you get that?
- Milan.

1047
01:18:04,147 --> 01:18:06,047
Well, it's awful.

1048
01:18:06,149 --> 01:18:10,984
Excuse me? I'm being criticized
by a grown woman wearing a bib?

1049
01:18:12,489 --> 01:18:14,423
We've got to make a good impression
with the stockholders...

1050
01:18:14,524 --> 01:18:16,651
and you look like
you're runnin' a state prison.

1051
01:18:18,495 --> 01:18:21,828
Well, maybe
it's a trifle severe, but...

1052
01:18:21,932 --> 01:18:25,333
All right.
I'll change before the meeting.

1053
01:18:25,435 --> 01:18:28,370
Now... tell me more
about... Roone.

1054
01:18:28,505 --> 01:18:33,499
What are you botherin' me about Roone for?
You know I'm worried about the meetin'.

1055
01:18:33,643 --> 01:18:36,771
The "meetin"'? Why are you
worried about the "meetin"'?

1056
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:39,508
<i>- What's got into you?
- Well, what's got into you?</i>

1057
01:18:39,616 --> 01:18:42,915
You know the stockholders
will do what we want.

1058
01:18:43,019 --> 01:18:46,580
<i>- Can I get you ladies anything else?
- Do not even contemplate.</i>

1059
01:18:46,690 --> 01:18:49,659
- Boy, you're bossy.
- Just the check, please.

1060
01:18:58,702 --> 01:19:01,569
Is that good enough for you?

1061
01:19:01,705 --> 01:19:04,640
Yeah, but it probably costs
$50 for each little bitty polka dot.

1062
01:19:06,009 --> 01:19:08,239
Listen. Meet me back here,
all right?

1063
01:19:12,082 --> 01:19:13,982
- Good morning.
- Hi.

1064
01:19:14,084 --> 01:19:18,111
I really must have that little
polka dot number in my size.

1065
01:19:18,221 --> 01:19:20,451
I'm a three.

1066
01:19:20,557 --> 01:19:23,082
A five.
Very well, give me a nine.

1067
01:19:33,737 --> 01:19:36,797
- Did you forget something?
- No, I don't think so.

1068
01:19:36,940 --> 01:19:39,465
Can you please tell me,
is my sister here?

1069
01:19:39,609 --> 01:19:41,668
Well, she was.

1070
01:19:41,811 --> 01:19:44,302
She left.

1071
01:19:44,414 --> 01:19:48,043
Well, then I guess I'll just have a
little bit of something myself. May I?

1072
01:19:50,153 --> 01:19:52,053
Excuse me.

1073
01:19:52,155 --> 01:19:55,022
I...

1074
01:19:55,125 --> 01:19:57,719
Let me guess. Pancakes.

1075
01:19:57,827 --> 01:19:59,920
Yes.

1076
01:20:04,100 --> 01:20:06,000
Madam.

1077
01:20:07,370 --> 01:20:10,066
You can give these...
to the maid.

1078
01:20:25,722 --> 01:20:27,656
So what do you think?

1079
01:20:27,757 --> 01:20:33,525
Sadie... I am so upset about this Hollowmade
sale, I don't know what to think.

1080
01:20:33,630 --> 01:20:35,621
<i>What are you worried
about that for?</i>

1081
01:20:35,732 --> 01:20:38,132
We're gonna march in there,
we're gonna set things right!

1082
01:20:38,235 --> 01:20:41,671
Set things... "right"?

1083
01:20:41,805 --> 01:20:44,433
Right! Come on. Let's go.

1084
01:20:44,574 --> 01:20:47,407
I knew I could c-count on you.

1085
01:20:52,048 --> 01:20:56,007
Keep the change.

1086
01:20:56,119 --> 01:20:59,247
Hell, if I know the girls, they
oughta be havin' breakfast about now.

1087
01:21:01,558 --> 01:21:06,757
- The girls?
- We should have been looking for two women. We are so stupid!

1088
01:21:07,998 --> 01:21:10,626
Rose, I have to visit
the toilet.

1089
01:21:10,734 --> 01:21:13,862
Well, we better hurry. The meeting. And
never say "toilet." Say "tee-tee."

1090
01:21:21,311 --> 01:21:24,109
Look.

1091
01:21:36,593 --> 01:21:38,527
Well, they're not in there.

1092
01:21:41,598 --> 01:21:44,897
- I have to go tee-tee.
- What are you talking about, go visit the toilet?

1093
01:21:46,002 --> 01:21:48,334
Hold on a second.

1094
01:21:50,140 --> 01:21:52,040
There they go.

1095
01:21:59,015 --> 01:22:02,382
<i>Wait a minute! I'm in here!</i>

1096
01:22:02,485 --> 01:22:04,646
Really?

1097
01:22:04,754 --> 01:22:07,416
Yoo-hoo.

1098
01:22:09,225 --> 01:22:13,059
What are we doing? I mean, look at us.
We are staking out a ladies' room.

1099
01:22:13,163 --> 01:22:15,063
Six more seconds,
and we've got them.

1100
01:22:15,165 --> 01:22:17,531
Can you contain yourself
for six more seconds?

1101
01:23:30,774 --> 01:23:32,799
You just get out of here!

1102
01:23:37,747 --> 01:23:40,841
They're clones.
What a cheap trick.

1103
01:23:40,950 --> 01:23:44,283
It's pod people!
I saw that movie!

1104
01:23:44,387 --> 01:23:47,481
- I was at the premier.
- Get back. Get back!

1105
01:23:47,590 --> 01:23:50,821
There is no such thing
as pod people, is there?

1106
01:23:50,927 --> 01:23:53,122
You're not my sister!

1107
01:23:53,229 --> 01:23:55,424
- And you're not my sister.
- Thank God!

1108
01:23:55,532 --> 01:23:58,296
Don't touch me!
Don't touch me, I say!

1109
01:23:58,401 --> 01:24:01,700
- Ghastly! Ghastly!
- Are they real?

1110
01:24:01,838 --> 01:24:03,829
They're robots. They wanna
kill us a-a-and take our places.

1111
01:24:03,973 --> 01:24:06,237
<i>- You've seen too many movies.
- You get back.</i>

1112
01:24:06,342 --> 01:24:10,574
- You just get back.
- We must be in some kind of parallel universe.

1113
01:24:10,680 --> 01:24:14,446
- That is the dumbest damn thing I've ever heard.
- You're such a hick!

1114
01:24:14,551 --> 01:24:17,111
- There's U.F.O. written all over this thing!
- They're probably relatives.

1115
01:24:17,220 --> 01:24:21,020
Relatives? How can they be?
Listen to them. They're imbeciles.

1116
01:24:21,124 --> 01:24:23,615
- Now listen.
- Now listen. I think what we ought to do...

1117
01:24:25,795 --> 01:24:28,286
Be quiet. We're going to go
clockwise, starting with me.

1118
01:24:28,398 --> 01:24:32,835
- Well, how come you?
- My God, it's me with a bad haircut.

1119
01:24:32,936 --> 01:24:35,564
Bad?

1120
01:24:35,705 --> 01:24:40,039
- I paid 12 bucks for this.
- I am going to kick your ass.

1121
01:24:40,143 --> 01:24:42,771
- I like it. I think if we could all...
- Stop it!

1122
01:24:42,879 --> 01:24:47,714
All right. Who are you, and where
the hell do you come from?

1123
01:24:47,817 --> 01:24:50,786
<i>Rosie, Rosie. My sister Rosie.</i>

1124
01:24:50,887 --> 01:24:53,117
- We gotta figure out who's who here.
- Rosie.

1125
01:24:53,223 --> 01:24:57,091
- I hope I'm still me.
- - Rose, there's a chance I could be her.

1126
01:24:57,193 --> 01:24:59,627
- Hardly.
- Isn't she divine?

1127
01:24:59,729 --> 01:25:02,323
I know for a fact.
I'm not me. Boo-hoo.

1128
01:25:02,432 --> 01:25:05,333
I just gotta be me.
Rosie, wait for me.

1129
01:25:11,474 --> 01:25:13,374
- How many? - Six brothers.
- And four sisters.

1130
01:25:13,476 --> 01:25:17,071
- And four sisters.
- Sadie, ten. You make eleven!

1131
01:25:17,180 --> 01:25:19,080
- You sure do.
- I can't believe it.

1132
01:25:19,182 --> 01:25:23,016
- Good morning. Good... morning.
- Morning.

1133
01:25:25,121 --> 01:25:28,147
Hold it. I know who it was.
It was that rickety old Nanny Lewis.

1134
01:25:28,258 --> 01:25:31,193
She couldn't see worth a darn. She spent
her last days puttin' diapers on chairs.

1135
01:25:31,294 --> 01:25:35,355
All my life I felt like I was out
of place, like I didn't belong.

1136
01:25:35,465 --> 01:25:39,231
<i>And I didn't. I hate my job.</i>

1137
01:25:39,335 --> 01:25:44,534
I hate shopping. I hate New York in June.
How about you?

1138
01:25:44,674 --> 01:25:47,142
I hate grits.

1139
01:25:47,277 --> 01:25:50,644
And I hate men who smell
like beer and bean dip.

1140
01:25:50,780 --> 01:25:54,511
And I hate makin' love in the
back of recreational vehicles!

1141
01:25:54,617 --> 01:25:56,517
Am I rich now?

1142
01:25:56,619 --> 01:25:59,554
<i>- We're all rich.
- -To hell with that.</i>

1143
01:25:59,656 --> 01:26:02,216
We got a meetin' to get to.

1144
01:26:02,325 --> 01:26:05,624
We're all on the same side,
now that we're sisters.

1145
01:26:05,728 --> 01:26:07,787
- Right.
- Right?

1146
01:26:07,897 --> 01:26:10,195
<i>Of course.</i>

1147
01:26:15,538 --> 01:26:18,598
<i>The meeting's already started.
Now, we can't all of us go in...</i>

1148
01:26:18,741 --> 01:26:21,369
because the spectacle of all
of this seems to upset people.

1149
01:26:21,511 --> 01:26:25,140
So, Rose, you take them sight-seeing.
I'll go in, call off the sale...

1150
01:26:25,248 --> 01:26:27,148
and then we'll all go
to Elaine's for lunch.

1151
01:26:27,250 --> 01:26:29,150
- Elaine's!
- Elaine who?

1152
01:26:29,252 --> 01:26:32,085
How do we know that you're gonna
call off that sale?

1153
01:26:32,188 --> 01:26:34,088
- No.
- Well, of course I will.

1154
01:26:34,190 --> 01:26:36,784
Are you sure that while we're out there
lookin' at the Statue of Liberty...

1155
01:26:36,893 --> 01:26:40,093
you won't be in there votin' so that Italian
fella can strip-mine Jupiter Hollow?

1156
01:26:40,196 --> 01:26:42,096
<i>- Strip-mine?
- Yes.</i>

1157
01:26:42,198 --> 01:26:47,727
- You lied to me.
- Would I strip-mine our birthplace?

1158
01:26:50,106 --> 01:26:53,598
No you don't. You're the only one's gonna get
strip-mined if you walk through that door.

1159
01:26:53,743 --> 01:26:55,836
You'd never miss
that little sinkhole.

1160
01:26:55,945 --> 01:26:58,937
- What did you say?
- I'll buy you a nice little condo on the East River.

1161
01:26:59,048 --> 01:27:01,482
- How dare you?
- Rosie! Rosie!

1162
01:27:01,584 --> 01:27:03,484
<i>Help me
with this terrible vulgar woman!</i>

1163
01:27:03,586 --> 01:27:07,886
- Rosie, don't you dare!
- I need your help!

1164
01:27:07,991 --> 01:27:12,394
Sadie, I just have to.

1165
01:27:12,495 --> 01:27:16,522
- I've got her!
- How could you do this to your own sister? Sadie!

1166
01:27:16,633 --> 01:27:18,760
<i>Don't let them do this!
I'll share it all with you!</i>

1167
01:27:18,868 --> 01:27:22,360
Join me in this, and I'll show you a
life that'll make your head spin!

1168
01:27:22,505 --> 01:27:25,565
I'll introduce you to the most
glamorous people in the world!

1169
01:27:25,708 --> 01:27:28,268
<i>- Joan Collins?
- Yes.</i>

1170
01:27:28,411 --> 01:27:30,470
No. Sadie, I know you're shallow,
but you're not heartless.

1171
01:27:30,580 --> 01:27:32,548
You don't want to help
do in Jupiter Hollow.

1172
01:27:32,649 --> 01:27:35,379
<i>You're not one of them.
You're me! Look.</i>

1173
01:27:35,485 --> 01:27:38,386
We even got the same taste
in clothes.

1174
01:27:38,488 --> 01:27:41,208
<i>Yeah, and where in the hell did you
get the money to buy such a dress?</i>

1175
01:27:41,257 --> 01:27:43,953
<i>- Or do I need to ask?
- Come on, Sadie.</i>

1176
01:27:44,060 --> 01:27:46,187
Who needs these dumb old
hayseeds anyway?

1177
01:27:48,798 --> 01:27:50,698
I do.

1178
01:27:52,502 --> 01:27:54,402
Grab her! Please!

1179
01:27:54,504 --> 01:27:56,972
In the closet!

1180
01:27:59,809 --> 01:28:02,903
You're a Ratliff deep down
inside. I knew you were.

1181
01:28:03,012 --> 01:28:05,879
- Don't push it.
- Quick, go get that chair.

1182
01:28:07,984 --> 01:28:10,851
<i>Security! Help!</i>

1183
01:28:10,953 --> 01:28:16,414
- I better stay with Sadie.
- Boy. I can't wait to loose my lip at those stockholders.

1184
01:28:16,526 --> 01:28:19,154
<i>- Wait! You can't.
- Why not?</i>

1185
01:28:19,262 --> 01:28:22,993
Because no one will believe you. The one
who always does the talking is Sa...

1186
01:28:23,099 --> 01:28:27,593
<i>You fools. They'll never fall for that.
They'll see right through her!</i>

1187
01:28:27,704 --> 01:28:29,695
<i>By the liquidation
of the Hollowmade factory...</i>

1188
01:28:29,839 --> 01:28:32,239
we'll double our corp...

1189
01:28:41,784 --> 01:28:45,220
<i>Open up! Let me out!</i>

1190
01:28:45,321 --> 01:28:47,516
<i>- Just hold your horses.
- Let me out!</i>

1191
01:28:47,623 --> 01:28:50,148
Good morning. Bill, Tom.

1192
01:28:50,259 --> 01:28:52,318
- Bill, Tom.
- Good morning.

1193
01:28:55,698 --> 01:28:57,859
Well, good morning,
ladies and gentlemen.

1194
01:28:57,967 --> 01:29:03,132
<i>Sorry if I'm a bit late. Well, let's get
right down to new business, shall we?</i>

1195
01:29:03,272 --> 01:29:06,673
Hollowmade.
I have come to the conclusion...

1196
01:29:06,809 --> 01:29:09,642
that the sale of Hollowmade
to Fabio...

1197
01:29:09,746 --> 01:29:13,580
- Alberici.
- What's his face, is not in our best interest.

1198
01:29:13,683 --> 01:29:16,481
Excuse me, Miss Shelton...

1199
01:29:16,586 --> 01:29:21,046
but we were just reminding the stockholders
that you strongly advocate liquidation.

1200
01:29:21,157 --> 01:29:24,024
<i>Rose, darling, may I have
a glass of water, please?</i>

1201
01:29:24,127 --> 01:29:27,585
- Certainly.
- I'm a very direct woman.

1202
01:29:27,697 --> 01:29:29,858
If I don't get your approval
to cancel this sale...

1203
01:29:29,966 --> 01:29:33,697
please understand that I...

1204
01:29:33,803 --> 01:29:37,739
I have controlling interest in
Denver-Carrington... M-M-Moramax...

1205
01:29:37,874 --> 01:29:41,605
and I will not hesitate to fire
y'all right here on the spot...

1206
01:29:41,744 --> 01:29:43,712
and replace y'all with a board
that will go along.

1207
01:29:43,846 --> 01:29:46,679
<i>Miss Shelton, this is outrageous.</i>

1208
01:29:46,783 --> 01:29:49,411
We were told the sale
would make a huge profit.

1209
01:29:49,519 --> 01:29:52,716
Isn't that
what we're in business for?

1210
01:29:52,822 --> 01:29:54,813
What the hell's going on here?

1211
01:29:57,059 --> 01:30:00,290
What Sadie means...
What she's trying to tell you is...

1212
01:30:00,396 --> 01:30:02,796
I just want to say...
Gentlemen...

1213
01:30:02,899 --> 01:30:04,799
I have something to say.

1214
01:30:06,936 --> 01:30:11,532
This deal is a fraud.

1215
01:30:11,674 --> 01:30:13,608
Mr. Alberici...

1216
01:30:13,709 --> 01:30:19,545
plans to close down the factory
and to strip-mine Jupiter Hollow.

1217
01:30:19,649 --> 01:30:23,585
<i>You're probably wondering how come all of a
sudden we care about this little Podunk town.</i>

1218
01:30:23,686 --> 01:30:27,918
Well, it's, it's simply
because, because...

1219
01:30:28,024 --> 01:30:30,424
Because of the terrible image
problem we've been facing.

1220
01:30:30,526 --> 01:30:33,654
As you well know, Moramax
has the image problem of...

1221
01:30:33,763 --> 01:30:36,698
of a, of a...

1222
01:30:38,868 --> 01:30:42,269
- Pit bull!
- Yes! Look. Everyone hates us.

1223
01:30:42,405 --> 01:30:45,772
<i>And now we're going to put 500 hard-working,
decent Americans out of work?</i>

1224
01:30:45,875 --> 01:30:47,866
- They're not gonna take it lyin' down.
- They're not.

1225
01:30:48,010 --> 01:30:51,241
They're liable to be arriving here
any minute now... in pickup trucks.

1226
01:30:51,347 --> 01:30:53,645
- R.V.'s.
- Factory workers picketing Moramax...

1227
01:30:53,749 --> 01:30:55,683
<i>with wives, kids, dogs.</i>

1228
01:30:55,785 --> 01:30:58,686
- Pigs!
- All right! Get on with it.

1229
01:30:58,788 --> 01:31:01,086
<i>Look. Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

1230
01:31:01,190 --> 01:31:05,183
we're asking you
to please say no to this sale...

1231
01:31:05,294 --> 01:31:08,229
<i>not just because it's gonna
spare 500 jobs...</i>

1232
01:31:08,331 --> 01:31:10,251
not just because it's gonna save
10,000 acres...

1233
01:31:10,333 --> 01:31:13,564
of the most beautiful land
God ever put on this earth...

1234
01:31:13,669 --> 01:31:17,002
and certainly not just because
it's the right thing to do.

1235
01:31:17,139 --> 01:31:20,404
No. We appeal to you
as business people.

1236
01:31:20,509 --> 01:31:22,909
We appeal to your basic
business instinct.

1237
01:31:23,045 --> 01:31:25,570
Yes! To save your own asses!

1238
01:31:27,383 --> 01:31:31,581
Yes. How many of you are in
favor of saving Jupiter Hollow?

1239
01:31:50,806 --> 01:31:53,104
<i>You were wonderful!</i>

1240
01:31:53,209 --> 01:31:55,143
So eloquent. You nailed 'em!

1241
01:31:55,278 --> 01:31:56,278
- Rose?
- Sadie!

1242
01:31:59,715 --> 01:32:01,580
That's him. He's here.

1243
01:32:01,684 --> 01:32:04,414
Two Sadies.

1244
01:32:08,224 --> 01:32:10,454
You. Psst.

1245
01:32:11,961 --> 01:32:15,590
<i>Aw!</i>

1246
01:32:18,034 --> 01:32:21,265
No. It's me.
-

1247
01:32:23,406 --> 01:32:25,806
<i>Think about it.</i>

1248
01:32:25,908 --> 01:32:28,342
<i>There must be higher love.</i>

1249
01:32:28,444 --> 01:32:30,537
<i>- Down in the heart.
- What next?</i>

1250
01:32:30,646 --> 01:32:33,308
<i>- Or hidden in the stars above.
- How about a nice long weekend on my yacht?</i>

1251
01:32:33,416 --> 01:32:35,611
<i>- Without it.
- We can describe the weekend...</i>

1252
01:32:35,718 --> 01:32:37,618
<i>- Life is a wasted time.
- As offshore drilling?</i>

1253
01:32:37,720 --> 01:32:43,158
<i>.Look inside your heart
I'll look inside mine.</i>

1254
01:32:43,259 --> 01:32:46,717
<i>Things look so bad everywhere.</i>

1255
01:32:46,829 --> 01:32:51,323
<i>.In this whole world what is fair.</i>

1256
01:32:51,434 --> 01:32:53,334
I have been out of control
with that kid.

1257
01:32:53,436 --> 01:32:55,336
<i>I mean, absolutely out of control with that kid.
- . We walk blind.</i>

1258
01:32:55,471 --> 01:32:58,406
<i>And we try to see.</i>

1259
01:32:58,507 --> 01:33:01,067
<i>- Falling behind in what could be.
- Yee!</i>

1260
01:33:01,210 --> 01:33:03,872
Rose, Rose. Remember me and the
ring, the dirty names? I'm sorry.

1261
01:33:03,980 --> 01:33:06,980
- You know, I'm so glad to see you because...
- I wanna take you for coffee.

1262
01:33:07,049 --> 01:33:10,382
- You got quite a mouth, haven't you?
- I feel so good today!

1263
01:33:10,486 --> 01:33:13,046
I just saved Jupiter Hollow.

1264
01:33:13,155 --> 01:33:16,318
<i>Bring me a higher love.</i>

1265
01:33:16,425 --> 01:33:18,950
<i>- Where's that higher love.
- Let's get one of these.</i>

1266
01:33:19,061 --> 01:33:21,757
<i>I keep thinking of.</i>

1267
01:33:21,864 --> 01:33:26,665
<i>- Worlds are turning and we're just hanging on.
- A nice front porch.</i>

1268
01:33:26,769 --> 01:33:28,794
- With a rocker.
- There.

1269
01:33:28,938 --> 01:33:31,600
<i>- Standing out there alone.
- Roone.</i>

1270
01:33:31,741 --> 01:33:36,906
- Will I have a rocking chair too?
- Sure will.

1271
01:33:37,013 --> 01:33:40,847
<i>- There must be someone who's feeling for me.
- Taxi.</i>

1272
01:33:51,027 --> 01:33:55,191
<i>Things look so bad everywhere.</i>

1273
01:33:55,297 --> 01:34:00,257
<i>In this whole world
what is fair.</i>

1274
01:34:00,369 --> 01:34:05,102
<i>We walk blind and we try to see.</i>

1275
01:34:06,675 --> 01:34:10,236
<i>Falling behind in what could be.</i>

1276
01:34:10,346 --> 01:34:13,247
<i>Bring me a higher love.</i>

1277
01:34:15,818 --> 01:34:19,914
<i>Bring me a higher love.</i>

1278
01:34:20,022 --> 01:34:23,048
<i>- Bring me a higher love.
- Excuse me.</i>

1279
01:34:23,159 --> 01:34:25,719
- Good morning.
- We'd like a room.

1280
01:34:25,828 --> 01:34:27,921
<i>- Please.
- .It's that higher love.</i>

1281
01:34:28,030 --> 01:34:30,021
<i>I keep thinking of.</i>

1282
01:34:30,132 --> 01:34:33,397
<i>Bring me a higher love.</i>

1283
01:34:35,304 --> 01:34:39,104
<i>Bring me a higher love.</i>

1284
01:34:40,209 --> 01:34:42,939
<i>Bring me a higher love.</i>

1285
01:34:44,413 --> 01:34:46,472
<i>I could rise above.</i>

1286
01:34:46,582 --> 01:34:49,745
<i>On a higher love.</i>

1287
01:34:49,852 --> 01:34:53,288
<i>I will wait for it.</i>

1288
01:34:55,091 --> 01:34:59,494
<i>I'm not too late for it.</i>

1289
01:34:59,595 --> 01:35:01,426
<i>Until then.</i>

1290
01:35:01,530 --> 01:35:04,522
<i>I'll sing my song.</i>

1291
01:35:04,633 --> 01:35:08,626
<i>To chant the night along.</i>

1292
01:35:08,771 --> 01:35:10,671
<i>Babe.</i>

1293
01:35:25,654 --> 01:35:30,114
<i>I could light the night up
with my soul on fire.</i>

1294
01:35:30,226 --> 01:35:34,822
<i>I could make the sun shine
from pure desire.</i>

1295
01:35:34,930 --> 01:35:39,765
<i>Let me feel that love
come over me.</i>

1296
01:35:39,869 --> 01:35:44,363
<i>Let me feel
how strong it could be.</i>

1297
01:35:54,984 --> 01:35:58,351
<i>Bring me a higher love.</i>

1298
01:35:59,989 --> 01:36:03,652
<i>Bring me a higher love.</i>

1299
01:36:04,760 --> 01:36:07,456
<i>Bring me a higher love.</i>

1300
01:36:08,797 --> 01:36:14,133

I keep thinking of.</i>

1314
01:37:16,165 --> 01:37:18,065
<i>That love
Bring me a higher love.</i>

1315
01:37:18,167 --> 01:37:21,000
<i>Bring me a higher love.</i>

1316
01:37:21,103 --> 01:37:23,003
