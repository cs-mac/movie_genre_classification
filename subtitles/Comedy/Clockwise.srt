1
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:51,460
Right, Orridge,

2
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:54,020
Popple! Potel!

3
00:01:54,981 --> 00:01:55,941
9:20!

4
00:02:01,742 --> 00:02:04,943
...cannot but feel deeply humbled.

5
00:02:05,103 --> 00:02:07,424
Five years ago, if I may be
personal for a moment...

6
00:02:07,623 --> 00:02:09,624
a rather overawed headmaster

7
00:02:09,824 --> 00:02:13,784
of a rather obscure, maintained
comprehensive school...

8
00:02:16,185 --> 00:02:17,225
Stimpson.

9
00:02:17,466 --> 00:02:21,146
Can you make 3:30 Monday
or 4:30 Tuesday?

10
00:02:22,227 --> 00:02:24,907
No, 10:35 on Thursday

11
00:02:25,107 --> 00:02:27,507
or 12:10 Friday.

12
00:02:28,307 --> 00:02:29,228
Ah, can't do I'm afraid.

13
00:02:31,628 --> 00:02:35,469
Or we could say 11:10 Friday week.

14
00:02:35,669 --> 00:02:37,870
That's fine for me, whatever suits you.

15
00:02:38,189 --> 00:02:39,110
Don't run!

16
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:41,350
Sharon Seeds...

17
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:42,671
9:20 !

18
00:02:46,552 --> 00:02:49,031
...arrived at the annual meeting
for the first time,

19
00:02:49,232 --> 00:02:51,552
amazed to find himself invited

20
00:02:51,712 --> 00:02:56,113
to become one of your very select
handful of additional members.

21
00:02:56,353 --> 00:02:57,193
Come in!

22
00:02:57,553 --> 00:03:01,274
He listened to the headmasters of schools
with great and glorious names...

23
00:03:01,394 --> 00:03:04,274
Come in ... great and glorious names...

24
00:03:04,435 --> 00:03:05,195
Headmaster...

25
00:03:05,354 --> 00:03:07,916
Eton and Harrow, Winchester
and Westminster.

26
00:03:08,115 --> 00:03:09,676
Am I taking 4H in G3

27
00:03:09,876 --> 00:03:10,996
at 10:30?

28
00:03:11,196 --> 00:03:14,077
...as they expatiated upon
a variety of weighty matters,

29
00:03:14,237 --> 00:03:16,637
scarcely did our nervous new boy...

30
00:03:16,797 --> 00:03:17,877
open his mouth.

31
00:03:18,277 --> 00:03:19,757
Sorry. This is your thing
with all the posh schools?

32
00:03:19,917 --> 00:03:21,558
4H in G3 at 10:30.

33
00:03:21,718 --> 00:03:22,838
2:15 okay Brian ?

34
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:24,879
Joan said that I'm taking 4H in G3

35
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:26,239
at 10:30.

36
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,839
I thought I was taking
4J in J3 at 11.00!

37
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,681
Peter Styles is taking 4H in G3
at 10:30.

38
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Right Ted, 2:15.

39
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,720
Slay 'em at the conference, Brian.

40
00:03:34,921 --> 00:03:36,281
Tell all those upper-class ponces

41
00:03:36,481 --> 00:03:38,122
we're gonna hang 'em from the lamp post

42
00:03:38,321 --> 00:03:39,921
by their old school ties!

43
00:03:40,282 --> 00:03:40,881
Right, thank you Ted!

44
00:03:42,162 --> 00:03:45,002
Ah, you're taking 4G in H3
at 10:35.

45
00:03:45,403 --> 00:03:46,363
Oh, God!

46
00:03:48,043 --> 00:03:50,763
They should try having 4G
at Harrow!

47
00:03:51,644 --> 00:03:55,885
Well, that obscure comprehensive school
was none other...

48
00:03:56,085 --> 00:03:58,966
than Thomas Tompion.

49
00:04:02,606 --> 00:04:06,407
And that overawed new boy
was none other than me.

50
00:04:06,647 --> 00:04:08,087
Little did he dream,

51
00:04:08,288 --> 00:04:11,448
within a few short years he would
be standing up here himself

52
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:15,728
as the very first comprehensive school
headmaster ever...

53
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:20,570
to become Chairman of
the Headmasters' Conference.

54
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:22,210
Clint...

55
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:25,451
Where do you think
you're going, Clint?

56
00:04:25,651 --> 00:04:27,091
The Guinness Book of Records?

57
00:04:27,932 --> 00:04:30,252
Every day this term so far,
isn't it Clint?

58
00:04:31,932 --> 00:04:34,412
Well don't just stand there, Clint!
Run!

59
00:04:38,373 --> 00:04:39,854
9:20, Clint.

60
00:04:41,494 --> 00:04:42,934
And come out from that doorway!

61
00:04:43,295 --> 00:04:45,175
Not you ... you!

62
00:04:45,975 --> 00:04:47,935
Yes you, I can see the smoke you fool.

63
00:04:48,135 --> 00:04:49,655
I can see your feet!

64
00:04:52,816 --> 00:04:53,776
Oh, it's you!

65
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:36,385
Right, now I've got some sad
news for you all...

66
00:05:37,985 --> 00:05:39,386
I'm going to be away today.

67
00:05:40,586 --> 00:05:41,706
I knew you'd be heartbroken!

68
00:05:43,706 --> 00:05:45,427
Right. Now where am I going?

69
00:05:45,586 --> 00:05:50,108
To the University of Norwich
in the fair county of Norfolk.

70
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:51,748
And why am I going there?

71
00:05:52,228 --> 00:05:55,348
Because that's where this
year's annual meeting

72
00:05:55,549 --> 00:05:58,029
of the Headmasters' Conference
is being held,

73
00:05:58,229 --> 00:06:01,389
and you can all feel rather
proud of yourselves.

74
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:07,391
Because they don't let just any old headmasters
into the Headmaster's Conference, far from it...

75
00:06:07,591 --> 00:06:11,752
The Headmaster's Conference is
the organisation to which

76
00:06:11,952 --> 00:06:14,793
all the great independent schools of this country
belong, places like Eton and Harrow,

77
00:06:15,232 --> 00:06:17,593
Winchester and Westminster.

78
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:20,394
The fee-paying schools.

79
00:06:20,794 --> 00:06:23,634
The 'posh' schools that we
all look down our noses at,

80
00:06:24,074 --> 00:06:25,595
and that we'd all send our children to

81
00:06:26,315 --> 00:06:27,795
if only we'd got the money.

82
00:06:31,356 --> 00:06:34,156
They don't usually let in headmasters of
common old garden comprehensive schools,

83
00:06:34,636 --> 00:06:36,477
of schools like this one.

84
00:06:36,677 --> 00:06:40,077
So, why you ask, why did they
let me in?

85
00:06:40,278 --> 00:06:41,597
Well, I'll tell you why.
They let me in

86
00:06:41,918 --> 00:06:43,318
because you and I,

87
00:06:44,598 --> 00:06:45,639
all of us together,

88
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:50,040
have made Thomas Tompion one of
the best schools in the country.

89
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,840
Right then. But today...

90
00:06:56,641 --> 00:06:57,480
9:20, Linda...

91
00:06:58,281 --> 00:06:58,921
But today is

92
00:06:59,321 --> 00:07:03,042
an extra special occasion,
because today

93
00:07:03,402 --> 00:07:06,962
today I take over as Chairman,

94
00:07:07,243 --> 00:07:09,924
Chairman of the Headmasters' Conference,

95
00:07:10,123 --> 00:07:11,243
and I shall be the first chairman

96
00:07:11,724 --> 00:07:14,684
in the whole of history,
in the whole of history

97
00:07:15,805 --> 00:07:19,806
who is headmaster of an ordinary, common
old garden state comprehensive school.

98
00:07:20,005 --> 00:07:22,886
So it really is one for the
Guinness Book of Records!

99
00:07:23,646 --> 00:07:26,647
Right then! So what am I going to
tell them in my speech this afternoon?

100
00:07:26,887 --> 00:07:29,568
I'm going to tell them how
we did it!

101
00:07:29,767 --> 00:07:31,328
I'm going to tell them how we all decided

102
00:07:31,527 --> 00:07:33,848
that we wanted a well-run,
orderly school...

103
00:07:34,728 --> 00:07:38,969
a school where we all knew what we were
supposed to be doing, Jimmy Picken,

104
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:44,010
a school where we all knew which room
we were supposed to be doing it in.

105
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:45,810
I'm not looking at you, Wendy Pilbrow,

106
00:07:47,771 --> 00:07:48,771
or you, Gary Bottoms.

107
00:07:50,412 --> 00:07:53,292
...and what we were supposed to be doing
it with, Debbie Jones.

108
00:07:55,733 --> 00:07:57,172
And above all,

109
00:07:57,373 --> 00:07:59,813
Clint Ailing and Dean Schreiber,
please note...

110
00:08:04,774 --> 00:08:06,374
when we were supposed to be
doing it!

111
00:08:10,255 --> 00:08:11,335
Right...

112
00:08:11,536 --> 00:08:12,616
Hymn 122:

113
00:08:12,776 --> 00:08:15,456
"He Who Would Valiant Be".

114
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:24,310
You're here again, Gayle?

115
00:09:27,631 --> 00:09:29,070
What are you here for, Shaun?

116
00:09:29,271 --> 00:09:30,551
Don't know. What are you here for?

117
00:09:30,751 --> 00:09:33,191
Oh, I'm... I'm merely...
I'm just...

118
00:09:46,614 --> 00:09:49,414
Hello, Mrs Stimpson.

119
00:09:51,015 --> 00:09:54,376
Surprised to find you lined up
with the ...

120
00:09:54,876 --> 00:09:56,516
What have you been... ?

121
00:09:56,676 --> 00:09:57,756
What?

122
00:09:57,957 --> 00:10:00,237
Did you over-cook the... ?

123
00:10:00,437 --> 00:10:02,078
Or were you late getting
him his...?

124
00:10:06,919 --> 00:10:08,078
Go on, hit 'im in the face!

125
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:13,320
If you think 9:20 outside
my study means

126
00:10:13,559 --> 00:10:16,560
11:10 in the playground, then you'll
be back here at 9:20 every day

127
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,760
until you learn to tell the time!

128
00:10:19,001 --> 00:10:22,282
I told you 9:50; the train's
not till 10:25.

129
00:10:22,802 --> 00:10:23,561
What do you want?

130
00:10:23,762 --> 00:10:25,562
Please sir, it's about
starting Greek, sir.

131
00:10:25,762 --> 00:10:27,483
9:20's not starting Greek.

132
00:10:27,643 --> 00:10:30,323
9:20's not being driven
to the railway station.

133
00:10:30,483 --> 00:10:31,403
What's 9:20?

134
00:10:31,604 --> 00:10:32,684
Executions, sir.

135
00:10:34,004 --> 00:10:35,044
Executions. Mr Jolly?

136
00:10:37,004 --> 00:10:39,405
I used to be like you.
Always late.

137
00:10:40,525 --> 00:10:43,686
Oh yes, forever in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

138
00:10:44,086 --> 00:10:47,446
I know what you mean, but I just
thought I ought to...

139
00:10:48,646 --> 00:10:49,727
I thought I ought to

140
00:10:50,327 --> 00:10:51,687
One or two things...

141
00:10:51,887 --> 00:10:54,088
One or two problems...

142
00:10:54,728 --> 00:10:55,808
One or two personal...

143
00:10:56,248 --> 00:10:57,809
I was like some miserable child

144
00:10:58,008 --> 00:11:00,529
wandering round the school,
with his calculator in one hand

145
00:11:00,729 --> 00:11:03,650
and his gym shoes in the other,
and not the slightest idea

146
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:05,250
where he's supposed to be.

147
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:07,610
G3, Leroy !

148
00:11:09,571 --> 00:11:10,531
I know the feeling.

149
00:11:10,731 --> 00:11:11,691
We all go through it, John.

150
00:11:11,891 --> 00:11:13,132
We all get lost.

151
00:11:14,492 --> 00:11:16,532
I'm afraid I've got into...

152
00:11:19,773 --> 00:11:20,813
Bed, John.

153
00:11:21,694 --> 00:11:24,333
Oh no, no, no. Nothing like that!
Well...

154
00:11:26,334 --> 00:11:28,375
Try getting out of it earlier
in the morning.

155
00:11:30,735 --> 00:11:31,815
But the thing is this...

156
00:11:32,256 --> 00:11:36,456
Because the first step to knowing who
we are, is knowing where we are,

157
00:11:36,616 --> 00:11:38,856
and when we are!

158
00:11:50,899 --> 00:11:52,259
I could drive you there.

159
00:11:52,459 --> 00:11:54,860
The train doesn't go till 10:25.

160
00:11:55,059 --> 00:11:56,260
You're ashamed of me,
aren't you?

161
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:57,820
You could go over to the hospital.

162
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:02,982
Don't tell me you're not allowed to  take wives,
because if you're the chairman, you are.

163
00:12:03,542 --> 00:12:04,622
I know that.

164
00:12:19,145 --> 00:12:21,585
You could take some of your old
ladies out for a drive.

165
00:12:22,505 --> 00:12:26,506
I don't have to come to the dinner
if that's what you're worrying about.

166
00:12:27,626 --> 00:12:30,747
I could go out and get a
hamburger on my own.

167
00:12:37,268 --> 00:12:39,429
This is a historic moment.

168
00:12:39,628 --> 00:12:42,429
I stand before you today as
your new chairman.

169
00:12:42,629 --> 00:12:45,790
I said I could go out and get a
hamburger in McDonald's.

170
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:49,711
Good, good. And did Paul get off
to school on time?

171
00:13:03,673 --> 00:13:05,354
- Right. So you'll find somewhere to park...
- Park?

172
00:13:06,874 --> 00:13:08,634
Make sure the train's running.

173
00:13:08,794 --> 00:13:10,755
If it's not, you'll have to drive me there.

174
00:13:17,676 --> 00:13:19,156
Platform 3,

175
00:13:19,316 --> 00:13:21,757
10:25 to Norwich. Calling passengers...

176
00:13:31,119 --> 00:13:33,999
Right, Norwich. We're on
time today, are we?

177
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:35,040
On the left.

178
00:13:35,199 --> 00:13:35,960
Right...

179
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,040
On the left, governor.
Train on the left.

180
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,521
Glen Scully and Mandy Kostakis !

181
00:13:46,422 --> 00:13:50,123
Yes! ... Right.

182
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:51,803
Tomorrow then.

183
00:13:52,283 --> 00:13:53,363
9:20!

184
00:13:57,724 --> 00:13:58,724
Right!

185
00:13:58,885 --> 00:14:00,164
On the left, then.

186
00:14:00,324 --> 00:14:01,085
Right.

187
00:14:01,285 --> 00:14:02,805
- Right?
-Right.

188
00:14:19,168 --> 00:14:22,729
This is a historic moment.

189
00:14:23,249 --> 00:14:25,730
I stand before you today

190
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:27,610
as your new chairman,

191
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:30,171
something that few of us

192
00:14:30,331 --> 00:14:33,531
ever expected to see happen
in our lifetime.

193
00:14:45,293 --> 00:14:48,975
Something that few of us expected to see
in our lifetime.

194
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:58,336
This is the train for Norwich?

195
00:14:59,257 --> 00:15:00,296
- Plymouth.
- Plymouth?

196
00:15:01,096 --> 00:15:01,896
That was Norwich on the left.

197
00:15:11,459 --> 00:15:12,738
Wait! Stop!

198
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:22,220
Right!

199
00:15:24,061 --> 00:15:25,501
The 10:25 to Norwich?

200
00:15:25,702 --> 00:15:27,342
- You've missed it.
- It's on time? It is running?

201
00:15:27,502 --> 00:15:29,502
It's run, it's gone, that's it.

202
00:15:29,662 --> 00:15:30,622
That's alright then.

203
00:15:33,523 --> 00:15:34,923
Gwenda!

204
00:15:38,664 --> 00:15:40,784
Can't you tell the difference
between left and right?

205
00:15:40,945 --> 00:15:42,305
You said Norwich...

206
00:15:42,465 --> 00:15:43,866
That's Plymouth!

207
00:15:44,025 --> 00:15:45,066
You didn't want Norwich?

208
00:15:47,546 --> 00:15:48,306
The speech!

209
00:15:48,506 --> 00:15:50,307
Speech? What, now ?

210
00:15:52,307 --> 00:15:54,147
Wait! Stop!

211
00:15:55,187 --> 00:15:57,508
They've asked me to do some damned
silly things as I've stood 'ere,

212
00:15:57,908 --> 00:15:59,788
but no one's ever asked me to
make a speech before.

213
00:16:01,229 --> 00:16:03,069
Come on! Try this one then.

214
00:16:03,269 --> 00:16:04,589
Plymouth, this one.

215
00:16:05,869 --> 00:16:07,150
The speech...

216
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:10,270
Please, could you give me
the speech?

217
00:16:18,672 --> 00:16:19,712
Right!

218
00:16:20,232 --> 00:16:21,313
He's back.

219
00:16:22,032 --> 00:16:23,833
You want the speech before
you go, do you?

220
00:16:24,433 --> 00:16:26,193
"My lords, ladies and gentlemen..."

221
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:27,954
The next one to Norwich?

222
00:16:28,193 --> 00:16:30,554
- 2:47, change at Peterborough.
- Oh!

223
00:16:32,555 --> 00:16:33,715
He didn't like it.

224
00:16:36,516 --> 00:16:37,316
Gwenda!

225
00:16:46,118 --> 00:16:49,158
Gwenda, wait !

226
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:07,242
Keep going, governor; it's never
too late till the last moment's come...

227
00:17:08,362 --> 00:17:09,762
just so long...

228
00:17:10,002 --> 00:17:12,683
just so long as your wife
hasn't taken the car!

229
00:17:31,084 --> 00:17:32,784
Gwenda!

230
00:17:38,488 --> 00:17:40,488
Where the hell is she?

231
00:17:40,928 --> 00:17:42,128
Oh, you're here. Where's Mum?

232
00:17:43,248 --> 00:17:45,369
- Don't tell me at the school.
- Yeah, I think she's...

233
00:17:45,889 --> 00:17:49,810
I know she was at the school, you idiot. Where'd she
go after that? Don't say the station!

234
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:50,810
Yeah, I think she said...

235
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:52,970
God, give me strength!

236
00:17:55,572 --> 00:17:57,332
But where is she now?

237
00:18:03,493 --> 00:18:04,613
She's not at the hospital? She's not...

238
00:18:04,633 --> 00:18:06,934
- ...driving old ladies around the countryside?
- Dunno, she might have said...

239
00:18:07,494 --> 00:18:08,893
She's at the hospital!

240
00:18:14,215 --> 00:18:15,255
Why aren't you at school?

241
00:18:16,156 --> 00:18:17,556
- Ah, well, I've got a...

242
00:18:17,616 --> 00:18:20,537
You've got a free, of course you've got a free.
Only you haven't got a free...

243
00:18:20,596 --> 00:18:23,856
- No, I've got a ...
- You've got a study period!

244
00:18:26,217 --> 00:18:28,178
I've got a hangover!

245
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:34,079
Taxi, taxi, taxi!

246
00:19:00,024 --> 00:19:02,785
Please sir, I'm terribly sorry Mr Stimpson.

247
00:19:02,984 --> 00:19:04,184
Laura ?

248
00:19:07,225 --> 00:19:09,385
I'm sorry, Mr Stimpson,
I've got a free...

249
00:19:09,706 --> 00:19:11,346
Right! Laura, hospital.

250
00:19:28,869 --> 00:19:29,990
Right...

251
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:31,470
Not far out of your way.

252
00:19:31,991 --> 00:19:34,791
It's not a free, Laura, it's a
study period.

253
00:19:34,991 --> 00:19:37,591
Study periods are not frees.

254
00:19:38,872 --> 00:19:40,272
This is your parents' car,
is it Laura?

255
00:19:40,472 --> 00:19:42,033
They don't mind.

256
00:19:42,352 --> 00:19:46,713
You've got A levels this year, Laura, you shouldn't
be driving around in study periods; you're a prefect.

257
00:19:46,873 --> 00:19:48,154
You should be setting an example.

258
00:19:48,554 --> 00:19:50,514
Right... Left !

259
00:20:00,917 --> 00:20:03,076
Right, wait here.

260
00:20:04,276 --> 00:20:06,277
Do you mind waiting? I don't know
where she goes.

261
00:20:06,437 --> 00:20:08,598
I'm only missing biology.

262
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,281
Mind the step.

263
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:28,161
So, she said:

264
00:20:28,362 --> 00:20:32,882
"Elly, it's no use letting Lou have the
sherry glasses...

265
00:20:33,282 --> 00:20:36,643
"She won't appreciate them,
she won't polish them...

266
00:20:37,163 --> 00:20:39,484
"You know what she's like." So I said:
"Well, all right...

267
00:20:39,803 --> 00:20:43,325
"I've no desire to burden people with
possessions they don't want," I said.

268
00:20:43,564 --> 00:20:45,645
"That's not my intention and
never has been."

269
00:20:46,165 --> 00:20:50,046
So naturally, she thought that if
the sherry glasses aren't going to Lou,

270
00:20:50,206 --> 00:20:51,846
they'd be going to Pam.

271
00:20:52,127 --> 00:20:53,767
But I thought to myself:

272
00:20:54,206 --> 00:20:55,607
"Wait a moment, Elly..."

273
00:20:55,807 --> 00:20:58,008
Keep moving Mrs Trellis,
nearly there.

274
00:20:58,207 --> 00:21:00,288
"Hold on a moment, Elly," I thought.

275
00:21:00,608 --> 00:21:02,208
Are we going to the hospital?

276
00:21:02,368 --> 00:21:04,008
We're at the hospital, Mrs Wheel.

277
00:21:04,449 --> 00:21:07,169
We're just going to have a
little look at the country.

278
00:21:07,369 --> 00:21:09,569
How lovely? Ooh, isn't that lovely?

279
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:11,970
"Not so fast, Elly," I thought.

280
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:15,090
"If Pam gets them, she'll give them
to Babs...,

281
00:21:15,411 --> 00:21:17,611
"and we all know what she'll do
with them."

282
00:21:18,011 --> 00:21:19,572
Aren't we lucky!

283
00:21:19,932 --> 00:21:21,332
Are we going to the hospital?

284
00:21:21,532 --> 00:21:24,412
Don't worry, Mrs Wheel.

285
00:21:24,652 --> 00:21:27,254
We'll come back to the hospital after
we've had a little look at the countryside.

286
00:21:27,654 --> 00:21:29,814
And then I thought:
"Well, hold on...

287
00:21:29,974 --> 00:21:31,653
"Millie's living in Majorca.

288
00:21:32,614 --> 00:21:35,895
"Well what on Earth is she going to do
with two dozen sherry glasses?

289
00:21:36,615 --> 00:21:41,135
But I thought: "Even if she wants them,
how should I get them to her?"

290
00:21:43,977 --> 00:21:45,577
Aren't we lucky people !

291
00:21:54,099 --> 00:21:55,818
Maybe I'm old-fashioned,

292
00:21:56,059 --> 00:21:58,859
maybe I don't understand
modern ideas about...

293
00:22:11,262 --> 00:22:13,182
We've missed her. She's gone!

294
00:22:20,223 --> 00:22:20,824
Which way then?

295
00:22:23,984 --> 00:22:25,945
Left or right, Mr Stimpson?

296
00:22:25,945 --> 00:22:29,906
Laura, Laura. Will you drive
me to Norwich?

297
00:22:30,186 --> 00:22:31,186
Okay. Where is it?

298
00:22:31,386 --> 00:22:34,506
It's vital, you see. I shouldn't ask you otherwise.
It's the headmasters' conference.

299
00:22:35,186 --> 00:22:36,227
I'm the first headmaster

300
00:22:36,426 --> 00:22:39,788
of a maintained comprehensive school
ever, in the whole of history, to become

301
00:22:39,987 --> 00:22:41,588
Chairman of the Headmasters' Conference.

302
00:22:41,948 --> 00:22:43,628
- Just tell me where it is.
- It's not far.

303
00:22:45,228 --> 00:22:46,669
Not all that far.

304
00:22:47,269 --> 00:22:47,909
Not too far.

305
00:22:48,069 --> 00:22:48,749
Left or right?

306
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:50,829
Oh, right...

307
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:52,150
Left!

308
00:22:53,271 --> 00:22:55,031
No, no... right... right.

309
00:23:05,993 --> 00:23:07,793
- 163 miles...
- Right.

310
00:23:08,873 --> 00:23:10,274
We'll have to ring your mum.

311
00:23:10,593 --> 00:23:12,394
Ah. They've got a phone here.
I'd better speak to her myself.

312
00:23:12,714 --> 00:23:13,754
I'll do it.

313
00:23:14,395 --> 00:23:16,634
I mean, non if she's the slightest
bit worried about it , Laura...

314
00:23:17,475 --> 00:23:19,075
I'll pay for the petrol, of course.

315
00:23:30,958 --> 00:23:33,038
This is a historic moment.

316
00:23:34,118 --> 00:23:37,198
We are going a long way...
We have come a long way...

317
00:23:37,519 --> 00:23:39,559
We are going 163 miles...

318
00:23:40,759 --> 00:23:42,880
John, listen to me, I’m going away.

319
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:44,880
It's over.

320
00:23:47,681 --> 00:23:48,681
No, Norwich.

321
00:23:48,881 --> 00:23:52,242
... if I may be personal for a moment.
I was feeling deeply historic...

322
00:23:53,562 --> 00:23:56,962
Five years ago, if I may be
historic for a moment...

323
00:23:57,283 --> 00:23:59,683
I was feeling deeply humble.

324
00:23:59,883 --> 00:24:04,084
An overawed master from an
obscure comprehensive school.

325
00:24:04,325 --> 00:24:07,125
Every time she comes to the house,
she makes some little remark...

326
00:24:07,325 --> 00:24:09,085
"Oh Elly," she goes,

327
00:24:09,325 --> 00:24:12,246
"it does take you ages to dust all your glasses...
I don't know how you do it.

328
00:24:12,445 --> 00:24:15,167
"I'm sure I shouldn't like to have
all those glasses to dust."

329
00:24:15,366 --> 00:24:17,887
She goes on and on about
those glasses, never stops.

330
00:24:18,047 --> 00:24:20,167
I sometimes wonder if she ever
thinks about anything else.

331
00:24:20,368 --> 00:24:22,688
She certainly never talks about
anything else.

332
00:24:23,048 --> 00:24:24,648
Of course, I don't say a word.

333
00:24:26,809 --> 00:24:29,929
I'm not much of a talker. There's plenty
I could say if I wanted to.

334
00:24:30,089 --> 00:24:31,730
Well, like that clock...

335
00:24:32,609 --> 00:24:33,810
that came to her,

336
00:24:34,290 --> 00:24:35,770
not that she's ever wound it.

337
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:39,011
Not that she's so much as looked
at it, from that day to this.

338
00:24:44,452 --> 00:24:45,412
Laura, what did she say?

339
00:24:45,572 --> 00:24:46,732
Oh, it's okay.

340
00:24:46,973 --> 00:24:51,813
...got rooms in that house so filled with things that
you can't open the door. Doesn't know what
she's got herself.

341
00:24:52,054 --> 00:24:54,574
I feel very badly about this Laura.
What are you missing?

342
00:24:55,254 --> 00:24:57,215
- You're missing double biology!
- i don't mind.

343
00:24:57,415 --> 00:25:01,096
You should mind. You've got A levels
and I'm taking you out of double biology.

344
00:25:02,255 --> 00:25:05,256
Laura, you're going to discover that life is full
of the most terrible moral choices.

345
00:25:05,736 --> 00:25:07,216
In fact I said to her the other day:

346
00:25:07,377 --> 00:25:09,417
I said, "you know what's going
to happen, don't you?

347
00:25:10,017 --> 00:25:14,498
"Someone's got to sort this lot out when you've
gone, and it won't be Dibs, it won't be Lou...

348
00:25:14,698 --> 00:25:16,538
"oh dear, no, it'll be me!"

349
00:25:16,698 --> 00:25:20,539
But no one pays attention to what anyone says;
I don't know why I waste my breath.

350
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:24,380
I can tell you she's got a clock in that
house that came from Mother

351
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:26,781
that's worth every penny of £100.

352
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:29,421
It's never been wound from
that day to this.

353
00:25:29,621 --> 00:25:30,622
So when she's in the house
the other day...

354
00:25:30,821 --> 00:25:33,822
That bloke with the doll, did they pay?

355
00:25:34,022 --> 00:25:35,542
They didn't pay!
They've never paid.

356
00:25:35,703 --> 00:25:36,783
Blue 1100, was it?

357
00:25:37,382 --> 00:25:41,424
Laura Wisely !
She lives round the corner.

358
00:25:41,584 --> 00:25:43,263
She's one of his pupils.

359
00:25:43,584 --> 00:25:44,944
How lovely!

360
00:25:45,744 --> 00:25:48,025
I saw the train leave.

361
00:25:48,465 --> 00:25:49,665
Isn't that lovely?

362
00:25:49,865 --> 00:25:51,545
The number! The number!

363
00:25:51,746 --> 00:25:53,746
I don't believe this;
there goes another one!

364
00:26:00,867 --> 00:26:02,907
Don't worry, it's okay. Honestly.

365
00:26:04,148 --> 00:26:07,828
If Thomas Tompion is a success story,
it is because we insist

366
00:26:08,029 --> 00:26:11,510
upon certain traditional standards.

367
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:12,789
Speech.

368
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:14,430
It's on the train.

369
00:26:18,351 --> 00:26:22,671
I should like at this point, if I may,
to pause for three hours

370
00:26:23,392 --> 00:26:26,672
160 miles in three hours...
to pause for

371
00:26:26,833 --> 00:26:28,152
say three-and-a-half hours

372
00:26:28,353 --> 00:26:30,793
three-and-a-half into 160...

373
00:26:30,953 --> 00:26:31,954
It's a good thing, actually.

374
00:26:32,474 --> 00:26:34,514
If you hadn't have come along,
I might not be here now.

375
00:26:35,954 --> 00:26:37,034
I had this great row

376
00:26:37,275 --> 00:26:38,195
with this bloke.

377
00:26:38,355 --> 00:26:41,115
I run back to the house and I saw the
car keys, and I thought, "Right!"

378
00:26:41,355 --> 00:26:44,556
We all understand, I think, that
lateness is a discourtesy to others.

379
00:26:46,196 --> 00:26:47,957
What is sometimes forgotten
these days

380
00:26:48,196 --> 00:26:51,077
is that it is three-and-a-half into 16

381
00:26:51,437 --> 00:26:52,957
It's about 50 miles an hour.

382
00:26:53,397 --> 00:26:56,478
He didn't like it when I told him
I was driving to Norwich with someone.

383
00:26:56,678 --> 00:26:57,358
"Who?" he said,

384
00:26:57,518 --> 00:26:58,878
"Who? Who?"

385
00:26:59,398 --> 00:27:00,399
He's so jealous.

386
00:27:00,839 --> 00:27:02,719
You told him you were driving
to Norwich?

387
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:06,080
- You told who you were driving to Norwich?
- This bloke.

388
00:27:11,961 --> 00:27:13,922
I couldn't ring Mum; she'd
have gone mad.

389
00:27:14,081 --> 00:27:16,042
But we can't stop again.

390
00:27:17,323 --> 00:27:18,323
And I never paid for the petrol.

391
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:22,804
Mrs Wisely ?

392
00:27:22,964 --> 00:27:23,604
Police ?

393
00:27:23,764 --> 00:27:25,204
No, Jolly. Mr Jolly.

394
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:28,445
I just wondered if Laura was...
Are you Laura's....police?

395
00:27:30,165 --> 00:27:33,806
Laura's at school, dear. I'm on
the phone. The car's been stolen.

396
00:27:34,005 --> 00:27:35,606
No, it isn't the police.

397
00:27:37,006 --> 00:27:38,047
It's someone for Laura.

398
00:27:38,246 --> 00:27:39,967
It's my husband. He's
beside himself.

399
00:27:40,487 --> 00:27:43,368
Well you'll have to come back and
speak to them, give them a description.

400
00:27:43,727 --> 00:27:45,328
I can't give them a description.

401
00:27:45,608 --> 00:27:48,168
Is it a Morris or an 1100?
I don't know.

402
00:27:48,928 --> 00:27:52,169
He's in such a state he doesn't know what
he's doing. He lives for that car.

403
00:27:52,569 --> 00:27:54,610
If it's standing outside in the
drive, he goes to pieces.

404
00:27:55,369 --> 00:27:57,050
Is it the anti-nuclear, dear?

405
00:27:57,330 --> 00:27:59,931
No, no, it's just that
Laura's not at...

406
00:28:00,531 --> 00:28:03,051
I don't want to alarm
you, but just thought I...

407
00:28:03,292 --> 00:28:06,932
Laura. She's disappeared.
No one knows where she is.

408
00:28:08,292 --> 00:28:10,093
No, he's just said.

409
00:28:10,253 --> 00:28:12,214
He's here now. He's just told me.

410
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:13,814
Who are you?

411
00:28:13,974 --> 00:28:17,494
- I am, well, I'm one of the staff at the...
- He's one of the staff at the ...

412
00:28:17,614 --> 00:28:18,655
You know, the music...

413
00:28:18,854 --> 00:28:19,855
He's the music.

414
00:28:24,136 --> 00:28:25,176
He's coming home.

415
00:28:25,456 --> 00:28:27,857
He doesn't know what he's doing.
He's going to do someone an injury.

416
00:28:29,256 --> 00:28:31,177
And you've no idea where she is?

417
00:28:31,377 --> 00:28:33,738
Well, does she have any relations...

418
00:28:33,898 --> 00:28:36,498
I just wondered if she had any sort of..

419
00:28:37,498 --> 00:28:38,498
well... in Norwich ?

420
00:28:38,939 --> 00:28:41,239
- Is this the hospital?
- No!

421
00:28:41,819 --> 00:28:43,859
Just wait there. Don't move.

422
00:28:44,899 --> 00:28:46,020
Ooh, doesn't this make a change!

423
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:49,740
No, it's not, it's Mrs... isn't it
Mrs Stimpson?

424
00:28:49,941 --> 00:28:51,181
I'm sorry, I just wondered

425
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:52,621
Laura's disappeared!

426
00:28:52,781 --> 00:28:53,902
She didn't tell you she was going?

427
00:28:54,062 --> 00:28:55,782
Not a word, and the car's
been stolen!

428
00:28:55,942 --> 00:28:58,342
I'm so sorry, Mrs Wisely,
I'm so sorry...

429
00:28:58,502 --> 00:29:01,904
We're waiting for the police. My
husband's out of his mind with worry.

430
00:29:02,103 --> 00:29:03,023
He says...

431
00:29:04,023 --> 00:29:05,223
that she's in Norwich.

432
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:09,464
I just somehow thought perhaps...
Oh hello, Mrs Stimpson. I just wondered if...

433
00:29:09,665 --> 00:29:11,865
Of course everyone
knows except me!

434
00:29:12,025 --> 00:29:13,625
Why Norwich? What could she
be doing in Norwich?

435
00:29:13,826 --> 00:29:15,746
I'll tell you what she's doing in Norwich.

436
00:29:15,905 --> 00:29:18,986
She's going to the annual meeting of
the Headmasters' Conference.

437
00:29:19,026 --> 00:29:20,227
- Oh no.
- You mean...?

438
00:29:20,387 --> 00:29:21,867
- Yes.
- You don't mean...?

439
00:29:22,068 --> 00:29:24,027
Of course, he wouldn't take me.

440
00:29:24,187 --> 00:29:27,468
I said I'd sit in the hotel,  I'd
eat in McDonalds, but oh no,

441
00:29:27,628 --> 00:29:28,708
because he's taking her.

442
00:29:28,909 --> 00:29:31,349
She said it was cello, every
evening, I knew it wasn't cello!

443
00:29:31,549 --> 00:29:32,869
A schoolgirl, a child...

444
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:34,309
She's got her A levels.

445
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:37,310
Look! A little family party.
Isn't that nice!

446
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:40,631
I think I'd better...
I think I must be...

447
00:29:41,071 --> 00:29:43,071
I haven't said anything about his
work, work, work...

448
00:29:43,511 --> 00:29:47,512
I haven't said anything about his everlasting
Conservative meetings, but I'm not going
to put up with this.

449
00:29:47,713 --> 00:29:49,832
Which one's the hospital?

450
00:29:51,473 --> 00:29:53,833
The hospital? I think it's
on the bypass

451
00:29:54,434 --> 00:29:55,754
Her father'll kill her.

452
00:29:55,994 --> 00:29:58,234
Can we see over the house?
Is it open today?

453
00:30:07,316 --> 00:30:08,476
Get in the car!

454
00:30:10,796 --> 00:30:12,597
I told you to stay in the car.

455
00:30:12,797 --> 00:30:13,877
What a day!

456
00:30:14,598 --> 00:30:17,297
- Where next?
- Norwich!

457
00:30:17,438 --> 00:30:19,959
So she said: "What happened
to Mother's blue tea counter?"

458
00:30:20,158 --> 00:30:21,279
And I said: "well, you're the
last person to ask..."

459
00:30:21,639 --> 00:30:22,679
Where's the other one?

460
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,880
She's in Norwich, at a conference
of headmasters with the headmaster.

461
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:30,560
His wife's beside herself, and what about
her A levels? We've got to find her, Ted.

462
00:30:30,801 --> 00:30:33,881
You've got to talk to her. Get the car out.
Oh, the car's been stolen.

463
00:30:34,121 --> 00:30:36,802
She's taken the car.
She can't drive.

464
00:30:40,523 --> 00:30:42,203
Mrs Wisely? Stolen car?

465
00:30:42,643 --> 00:30:45,403
- There! There.
-There.

466
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:46,804
Here.

467
00:30:58,086 --> 00:31:00,206
Now keep calm. Don't go mad.

468
00:31:00,606 --> 00:31:02,047
Well, what are you
waiting for?

469
00:31:07,568 --> 00:31:08,688
"Mother's blue teapot indeed," I said.

470
00:31:08,848 --> 00:31:11,968
"well you should know, you were
the last to see it."

471
00:31:12,849 --> 00:31:16,010
Then the next thing I know,
she's eyeing the sherry glasses.

472
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:20,330
She's always been eyeing the sherry glasses
ever since she first came to the home...

473
00:31:21,371 --> 00:31:23,051
- Ten o'clock in the morning?
- What?

474
00:31:23,771 --> 00:31:25,112
You had a row with your boyfriend

475
00:31:25,112 --> 00:31:27,372
- at 10 o'clock in the morning?
- I had a free.

476
00:31:27,572 --> 00:31:30,772
Study periods are for study, Laura.

477
00:31:31,893 --> 00:31:33,533
Evening is the proper time to
have rows

478
00:31:33,693 --> 00:31:34,694
with your boyfriend.

479
00:31:34,854 --> 00:31:36,533
I couldn't see him in the evening.

480
00:31:36,694 --> 00:31:38,854
Does the sun ever appear late
over the horizon, saying

481
00:31:39,054 --> 00:31:41,535
please sir, the bus was full,
the train was on strike?

482
00:31:42,375 --> 00:31:44,175
His wife wouldn't let him
go out in the evening.

483
00:31:44,495 --> 00:31:47,296
If the sun depended on public
transport to arrive each day...

484
00:31:47,495 --> 00:31:48,096
His wife?

485
00:31:48,696 --> 00:31:50,536
It's okay. He didn't get on with her.

486
00:31:55,578 --> 00:31:56,898
I suppose you have passed
the driving test, Laura.

487
00:31:57,858 --> 00:31:58,818
As good as...

488
00:31:59,018 --> 00:31:59,738
What's that supposed to mean?

489
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:01,579
I only failed on one thing.

490
00:32:02,019 --> 00:32:02,819
Right. Pull in!

491
00:32:03,859 --> 00:32:05,420
Now please, at once.

492
00:32:16,861 --> 00:32:19,262
Let's get one thing straight
at any rate.

493
00:32:23,903 --> 00:32:25,423
Get in the other side.

494
00:32:31,824 --> 00:32:32,504
Blue 1100.

495
00:32:33,065 --> 00:32:34,666
Million blue 1100s.

496
00:32:34,865 --> 00:32:36,866
A middle-aged man and a girl.

497
00:32:40,547 --> 00:32:42,386
That's life I'm afraid, Laura.

498
00:32:42,547 --> 00:32:45,187
You can drive, but you
haven't passed the test.

499
00:32:45,587 --> 00:32:48,588
I, on the other hand, have passed
the test but wouldn't claim...

500
00:33:59,042 --> 00:34:00,882
Don't worry, we'll just pull the
wing away from the wheel.

501
00:34:01,442 --> 00:34:02,563
She'll be all right.

502
00:34:03,523 --> 00:34:05,563
It'll all be covered, Laura.
Your dad's insurance...

503
00:34:07,083 --> 00:34:08,924
I'm the one they'll summons,

504
00:34:09,724 --> 00:34:10,804
- and the one who'll have to tell your dad...
- Yes,

505
00:34:11,044 --> 00:34:14,085
and another thing. Have you
stopped for petrol anywhere?

506
00:34:17,605 --> 00:34:18,766
Petrol?

507
00:34:21,606 --> 00:34:22,607
No, we filled it up yesterday.

508
00:34:28,368 --> 00:34:29,008
Didn't we, Laura?

509
00:34:51,152 --> 00:34:54,173
No!! That's part of our car!

510
00:35:03,694 --> 00:35:05,935
It's jangling all about, I can hear it.

511
00:35:06,575 --> 00:35:07,815
It's scratching the paint.

512
00:35:07,975 --> 00:35:10,896
We must find a phone, warn them
I'm not going to be there until 4.00.

513
00:35:12,177 --> 00:35:14,857
Does the tide ever go out during
a study period, saying:

514
00:35:15,017 --> 00:35:17,778
"please sir, I'm having a row
with my boyfriend"?

515
00:35:20,258 --> 00:35:22,579
It isn't someone on the staff, is it?

516
00:35:23,539 --> 00:35:24,938
It's not Mr Slidewell?

517
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:30,100
Mr Fellowdew?

518
00:35:35,421 --> 00:35:36,582
- It's not Mr Jolly?
- No.

519
00:35:38,342 --> 00:35:39,142
I wasn't anywhere near him.

520
00:35:40,582 --> 00:35:43,062
You realise if you're not licensed,
we're not insured.

521
00:35:43,823 --> 00:35:45,263
12:59...

522
00:35:49,584 --> 00:35:51,104
Phone! Here we are.

523
00:36:01,506 --> 00:36:03,427
10p. Have you got 10p?

524
00:36:12,708 --> 00:36:15,689
Alright then, in the third race
tipping no.4  for a win and no.7...

525
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:17,190
Sorry!

526
00:37:00,758 --> 00:37:02,479
<i>University of Norwich.</i>

527
00:37:27,363 --> 00:37:28,443
They're vandalising

528
00:37:28,603 --> 00:37:30,404
those phones again, Pat.

529
00:37:30,603 --> 00:37:32,364
All right Mum, just go.

530
00:37:32,524 --> 00:37:33,485
- When's lunch?
- Now.

531
00:37:33,684 --> 00:37:34,884
Granny's just getting it.

532
00:37:35,205 --> 00:37:36,765
Tell Tom and Boo lunch is
on the table.

533
00:37:36,965 --> 00:37:39,045
The phones, Pat!

534
00:37:39,926 --> 00:37:41,886
They're at the phones again.

535
00:37:43,046 --> 00:37:44,527
I'll just put my woolly on.

536

<i>University of Norwich.</i>

537
00:38:15,853 --> 00:38:17,253
A girl and a boy.

538
00:38:17,493 --> 00:38:20,374
He's showing off his muscles,
and she's egging him on.

539
00:38:20,614 --> 00:38:23,014
I'll try and keep them talking
till the police get here.

Thank God, look

542
00:38:32,816 --> 00:38:35,337
I'm calling long distance, and
I've only got one 10p,

543
00:38:35,536 --> 00:38:39,178
so could you please give a message to the

00:38:40,857 --> 00:38:43,579
Yes, our annual meeting's being held there;
it starts at 5.00.

546
00:38:43,778 --> 00:38:46,459
Would you tell him I was supposed
to be there at 3.00...

547
00:38:46,659 --> 00:38:47,859
<i>Hello. University of Norwich.</i>

Can't you hear me?

549
00:38:49,299 --> 00:38:51,260
I said, would you tell him I'm going
to be slightly late

550
00:38:51,419 --> 00:38:53,140
<i>Put your money in the box, caller.</i>

551
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:55,300
I've put my money in the box!

552
00:38:55,501 --> 00:38:57,141
It's eaten the money.

553
00:38:57,461 --> 00:38:59,701
I haven't got any more money.

554
00:39:17,545 --> 00:39:18,265
How old are you?

555
00:39:18,465 --> 00:39:19,506
It's out of order.

556
00:39:22,506 --> 00:39:24,506
I'll tell you how old you are.

557
00:39:25,306 --> 00:39:27,307
You're two years and one day
older than me.

558
00:39:27,467 --> 00:39:29,427
I mean it took the money, and

559
00:39:31,627 --> 00:39:32,348
Pat?

560
00:39:34,028 --> 00:39:37,169
- Fancy meeting you like this!
- Good God!

561
00:39:38,229 --> 00:39:39,749
- You don't live here?
- No, no.

562
00:39:41,789 --> 00:39:44,990
I don't live here. I don't even live
in England. I'm just seeing my mum.

563
00:39:45,311 --> 00:39:46,831
Isn't that amazing!

564
00:39:47,291 --> 00:39:49,451
- Well...
- Anyway, run.

565
00:39:49,411 --> 00:39:52,592
you don't have to tell me what you're
up to these days because I can see...

566
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:53,832
you're late!

567
00:39:53,992 --> 00:39:55,352
No, no no; it was the third
telephone box in a row...

568
00:39:55,553 --> 00:39:56,913
Still late for everything,
are you Brian?

569
00:39:57,073 --> 00:39:58,153
No, I'm not late these days
as a matter of fact...

570
00:39:58,433 --> 00:40:00,914
What was it this time, Brain? Buses on
strike? Got the wrong train?

571
00:40:01,074 --> 00:40:01,874
I'm not late! Ha, ha, ha...

572
00:40:03,314 --> 00:40:04,994
I'd say come and have lunch.

573
00:40:05,195 --> 00:40:06,074
Um, unfortunately

574
00:40:06,235 --> 00:40:08,435
All right, Brian. Just your luck isn't it.

575
00:40:08,595 --> 00:40:11,796
Running into someone you haven't seen
for twenty years when you're late already.

576
00:40:11,996 --> 00:40:14,797
No, no I'm not late.
I'm merely in a hurry.

577
00:40:15,516 --> 00:40:16,297
Well, give me a kiss

578
00:40:16,497 --> 00:40:17,877
and I'll let you run.

579
00:40:26,279 --> 00:40:28,199
Lovely to see you again, Brian.

580
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:30,799
Here, come on, and I'll give
you Mum's number.

581
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,420
You can phone me when you've
got a moment.

582
00:40:32,421 --> 00:40:33,421
Oh, right.

583
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:37,721
You won't believe this, but
your dad and I...

584
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:39,742
were at training college together,
and he was late...

585
00:40:39,841 --> 00:40:41,242
Pat, could I make a phone call?

586
00:40:41,242 --> 00:40:43,522
He was late the first time
he took me out,

587
00:40:43,722 --> 00:40:44,723
He was late every time
he took me out.

588
00:40:45,243 --> 00:40:48,323
He was late the day he collected
his diploma.

589
00:40:48,483 --> 00:40:49,524
Oh, he hasn't told you
about all that.

590
00:40:50,803 --> 00:40:53,284
Haven't you told her about
your murky past then?

591
00:40:54,044 --> 00:40:55,244
He's not even listening.

592
00:40:58,125 --> 00:40:59,765
I said you're not even listening.

593
00:40:59,965 --> 00:41:01,245
I suppose not.

594
00:41:05,126 --> 00:41:05,926
Out!

595
00:41:09,047 --> 00:41:12,088
Well, I can see your mind's on other
things. I mustn’t hold you up.

596
00:41:12,288 --> 00:41:13,088
Yes, we must be on our way.

597
00:41:14,429 --> 00:41:16,849
- No!
- She won't let...

598
00:41:17,108 --> 00:41:19,270
poor old dad drive, will she?

599
00:41:19,289 --> 00:41:21,089
No, I won't.

600
00:41:21,289 --> 00:41:22,910
She's lovely, Brian. A real
glint in her eye.

601
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:26,051
Yes. Ah, Pat? Can you drive?

602
00:41:26,290 --> 00:41:28,691
Great to see you anyway.
Can I drive?

603
00:41:28,891 --> 00:41:30,291
You passed your test?
You've got a licence?

604
00:41:30,372 --> 00:41:32,952
Yes. What's all this about?

605
00:41:33,012 --> 00:41:36,052
Have a drive! Go on! See what
you think. All right?

606
00:41:37,452 --> 00:41:38,773
Just round the block.

607
00:41:44,854 --> 00:41:46,815
I'd like to know what you think.
Come on!

608
00:41:47,615 --> 00:41:49,075
Well I thought you were late.

609
00:41:49,435 --> 00:41:50,935
Ah, I'm not late!
Ha, ha, ha, ha...

610
00:41:52,616 --> 00:41:53,696
Funny man you are, Brian.

611
00:42:01,617 --> 00:42:03,538
I haven't driven in this country
for twenty years.

612
00:42:03,698 --> 00:42:04,378
Never mind, off you go.

613
00:42:04,538 --> 00:42:06,018
- Married a dentist down under.
- Right.

614
00:42:06,258 --> 00:42:08,499
Just brought the kids over to stay
with Mum. We were going to have lunch.

615
00:42:08,539 --> 00:42:10,139
- Right. Let's go.
- You've got time for lunch, haven't you?

616
00:42:10,339 --> 00:42:11,819
I bet you're starving.

617
00:42:11,979 --> 00:42:14,140
I've got one your age.
- Later. Get the driving over first!

618
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:16,781
Once round the block then...

619
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:18,341
Close your eyes and pray.

620
00:42:20,381 --> 00:42:21,381
- On the left still, isn't it?
- Right.

621
00:42:22,322 --> 00:42:23,261
On the right?

622
00:42:23,322 --> 00:42:24,342
Left, left.

623
00:42:24,402 --> 00:42:25,382
Right.

624
00:42:33,344 --> 00:42:34,964
Stop them! Stop them!

625
00:42:35,744 --> 00:42:37,305
What? They, they did the phone?

626
00:42:37,465 --> 00:42:40,065
The phone yes, but now they've
kidnapped my daughter.

627
00:42:40,345 --> 00:42:41,665
It's lovely.

628
00:42:41,765 --> 00:42:42,485
What?

629
00:42:42,765 --> 00:42:45,766
- The car.
- Oh, right.

630
00:42:52,208 --> 00:42:54,728
There's perhaps something not quite right
up here somewhere.

631
00:42:54,969 --> 00:42:56,169
That's the wing.

632
00:42:56,368 --> 00:42:57,649
The wing?

633
00:42:58,288 --> 00:43:01,250
He pulled it off. Dad'll kill me.

634
00:43:03,930 --> 00:43:06,810
It's Dad's car. It's not his car.

635
00:43:07,531 --> 00:43:10,571
He's not my father.
He's Mr Stimpson.

636
00:43:14,812 --> 00:43:17,372
Why did you tell her I
was your daughter?

637
00:43:18,292 --> 00:43:20,653
Daughter? Who, me? No, son.
I haven't got a daughter.

638
00:43:24,134 --> 00:43:25,894
What, Laura?
Laura's one of my girls.

639
00:43:27,654 --> 00:43:31,135
One of my sixth formers. She's very kindly
driving me to Norwich.

640
00:43:31,415 --> 00:43:33,935
It's a headmasters conference; I'm a
headmaster now.

641
00:43:34,215 --> 00:43:36,576
Yes, well I'll say 'goodbye'
then, Brian.

642
00:43:37,737 --> 00:43:38,336
You can't stop here!

643
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:39,897
It's all right, I'll walk back.

644
00:43:40,057 --> 00:43:40,737
The police...

645
00:43:42,097 --> 00:43:44,658
It's your life, Brian. I don't want to say
anything. I just don't want to get involved.

646
00:43:44,818 --> 00:43:45,778
Keep going, keep going!

647
00:43:47,158 --> 00:43:50,499
We'll be out in the county in a minute.
My children don't know where I am.

648
00:43:50,539 --> 00:43:52,700
- We're just sitting down to lunch.
- It's all right. We'll find a bus stop.

649
00:43:52,899 --> 00:43:54,260
- Find a bus stop?
- Here's a bus stop.

650
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:55,741
You can't stop at a bus stop.

651
00:43:56,060 --> 00:43:56,860
Well where am I going?

652
00:43:57,020 --> 00:43:57,980
Straight on.

653
00:44:01,781 --> 00:44:03,021
Well done.

654
00:44:03,181 --> 00:44:04,062
Hooting.

655
00:44:04,261 --> 00:44:04,902
Oh, don't mind him!

656
00:44:05,782 --> 00:44:08,423
I don't know where we are.
I don't know where we're going!

657
00:44:08,623 --> 00:44:09,863
I'll tell you. One moment.

658
00:44:15,244 --> 00:44:16,205
It was always the same thing.

659
00:44:16,404 --> 00:44:17,685
You feel sorry for them, don't you?

660
00:44:17,845 --> 00:44:20,405
You'd start off in evening dress
and silver dance shoes,

661
00:44:20,605 --> 00:44:22,685
and end up running, your skirt in your hand
and your heel down a grating.

662
00:44:23,365 --> 00:44:24,766
And then they turn round and
scream at you.

663
00:44:25,005 --> 00:44:27,206
- Next left. Be posted to Northampton.
- Northampton!

664
00:44:29,047 --> 00:44:29,887
We'll put you on the train.

665
00:44:30,087 --> 00:44:32,687
What do you mean you'll put me on the
train? They're sitting round the table,

666
00:44:32,887 --> 00:44:33,888
waiting to start lunch!

667
00:44:34,087 --> 00:44:34,728
Get a move on then!

668
00:44:37,008 --> 00:44:38,448
Put your foot down!

669
00:44:38,689 --> 00:44:40,209
It's like being nineteen again.

670
00:44:40,569 --> 00:44:42,410
I hated being nineteen.

671
00:44:45,690 --> 00:44:47,130
Right, fine.

672
00:44:47,530 --> 00:44:51,011
We shouldn't be doing this kind
of speed, not in a car like this.

673
00:44:51,012 --> 00:44:52,012
Right, right.

674
00:44:53,332 --> 00:44:55,451
Listen to it, it's coming to pieces.

675
00:44:55,612 --> 00:44:57,172
Terrible.

676
00:44:57,932 --> 00:45:00,333
Now where am I going?
I'm going left, am I?

677
00:45:01,573 --> 00:45:02,533
Right, right.

678
00:45:02,694 --> 00:45:03,654
Right?

679
00:45:11,735 --> 00:45:13,735
All right, 10 minutes and we'll
be in Northampton.

680
00:45:14,176 --> 00:45:15,376
Northampton was left.

681
00:45:15,615 --> 00:45:16,576
That was our turn?

682
00:45:16,776 --> 00:45:18,416
- You said 'right'.
- I said "left"!

683
00:45:18,617 --> 00:45:20,777
Brian, don't you shout at me.

684
00:45:20,937 --> 00:45:22,217
Can't anyone tell left from right?

685
00:45:22,417 --> 00:45:23,617
She's doing her best.

686
00:45:24,338 --> 00:45:27,698
Right. Just take the next left,
will you?

687
00:45:27,939 --> 00:45:28,698
I'll get straight out of
the car.

688
00:45:29,338 --> 00:45:31,499
You can't get out of the car now
till we get to Northampton.

689
00:45:31,659 --> 00:45:32,419
Always late,

690
00:45:32,819 --> 00:45:35,220
and always trying to make it my
fault, always screaming at me.

691
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:39,341
I was not screaming, I was merely
saying 'left'.

692
00:45:39,821 --> 00:45:43,341
Now they've made you headmaster. Like
putting a shark in charge of a swimming pool!

693
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:46,602
Left. Left.

694
00:45:47,462 --> 00:45:48,903
Left! Left!

695
00:45:52,743 --> 00:45:55,143
What's this? This isn't going anywhere!

696
00:45:55,344 --> 00:45:58,385
It's going back to the
Northampton Road.

697
00:45:58,584 --> 00:45:59,785
They'll be out of their minds.

698
00:45:59,985 --> 00:46:04,146
Just keep absolutely calm, and turn left
and left again.

699
00:46:05,266 --> 00:46:07,186
So, left here...

700
00:46:08,586 --> 00:46:09,986
Perfect, thank you.

701
00:46:10,386 --> 00:46:11,467
Well done.

702
00:46:11,707 --> 00:46:13,187
Now, we just go round the
next corner... and...

703
00:46:21,029 --> 00:46:22,069
Now what?

704
00:46:22,589 --> 00:46:24,509
Don't worry. We just go back.

705
00:46:24,870 --> 00:46:25,950
Back?

706
00:46:26,310 --> 00:46:28,591
Right. Reverse.

707
00:46:28,750 --> 00:46:30,911
How did this happen to me?

708
00:46:31,991 --> 00:46:33,551
In reverse gear.

709
00:46:38,352 --> 00:46:40,393
Put it into reverse.

710
00:46:42,033 --> 00:46:44,474
Show her where
reverse is, Laura.

711
00:46:47,375 --> 00:46:51,475
Good, well done. Come on then.
Come on.

712
00:46:52,076 --> 00:46:53,276
Come on.

713
00:46:52,977 --> 00:46:55,577
Come on. Well done.

714
00:46:55,478 --> 00:46:57,078
Come a... STOP!

715
00:47:05,917 --> 00:47:08,878
This is a historic moment.

716
00:47:09,719 --> 00:47:12,879
Little did I dream that I should
be sitting here...

717
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:19,360
When are we going to have lunch?

718
00:47:24,002 --> 00:47:25,121
- Into the field...
- Into the field?

719
00:47:27,482 --> 00:47:29,282
Just do as I say.

720
00:47:48,206 --> 00:47:51,847
We'll get something to eat in Northampton.
We'll hit the road in about 100 yards.

721
00:47:52,007 --> 00:47:52,967
I know this is wrong.

722
00:47:53,887 --> 00:47:55,727
I knew it! I knew it!

723
00:48:20,612 --> 00:48:23,013
It'll be just beyond that next hedge.

724
00:48:46,858 --> 00:48:49,058
Just beyond the next hedge.

725
00:48:49,578 --> 00:48:51,219
Je vois déjà les voitures.

726
00:48:51,379 --> 00:48:53,579
Look, I can see the cars. I can
see them moving. Right then.

727
00:48:53,739 --> 00:48:55,019
There's no track-

728
00:48:55,539 --> 00:48:57,620
We've come to the end of the track.

729
00:48:57,860 --> 00:49:00,821
We don't need a track.
It's grass. Come on.

730
00:49:41,228 --> 00:49:44,349
Perhaps I sound a little old fashioned,
but we live in a world where time

731
00:49:44,549 --> 00:49:47,949
is becoming not less important, but
ever more so.

732
00:49:48,150 --> 00:49:50,671
Imagine a spacecraft running late;

733
00:49:50,911 --> 00:49:54,351
it might miss its orbit completely,
and find itself wandering off

734
00:49:54,511 --> 00:49:56,952
into the trackless depths of the universe.

735
00:50:11,915 --> 00:50:14,815
A nightmare! A nightmare!

736
00:50:14,835 --> 00:50:17,875
Hold it, and hold it. Let's just have
a quiet think.

737
00:50:18,076 --> 00:50:18,956
I'm never going to get home!

738
00:50:19,676 --> 00:50:21,517
Stop it! You'll break the engine.

739
00:50:24,058 --> 00:50:28,238
Thank you. Thank you. Now,
it's five to two.

740
00:50:28,638 --> 00:50:29,438
I'm hungry.

741
00:50:30,719 --> 00:50:32,639
You're hungry? We're all hungry.

742
00:50:32,958 --> 00:50:36,839
We can't eat now because we're in
the middle of a field.

743
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:41,240
So, we have to adapt
to our circumstances.

744
00:50:47,202 --> 00:50:49,482
Now, I wanted to be in Norwich at 3.00

745
00:50:49,642 --> 00:50:51,043
to greet everyone as they arrive.

746
00:50:51,242 --> 00:50:53,883
I can't be there at 3.00, so instead

747
00:50:54,603 --> 00:50:56,403
I want to be there at 5.00

748
00:50:56,603 --> 00:50:58,124
in time to deliver my speech.

749
00:50:58,844 --> 00:51:01,924
This is how mankind has evolved
from the primeval slime...

750
00:51:02,444 --> 00:51:05,045
by adapting to circumstances.

751
00:51:05,525 --> 00:51:08,526
We can't go forwards, so we'll
go backwards instead.

752
00:51:08,686 --> 00:51:11,366
Put it in reverse for her, Laura.
I'll push.

753
00:51:12,467 --> 00:51:15,067
Right? Right.

754
00:51:42,753 --> 00:51:48,253
No! Thank you. Stay here.
Don't move.

755
00:52:26,101 --> 00:52:29,501
Excuse me... Hello.

756
00:52:32,462 --> 00:52:34,583
Can you tell me...?
Do you know...?

757
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:38,424
Is there anyone round
here with a tractor?

758
00:52:39,264 --> 00:52:40,224
Won my bet, anyway.

759
00:52:42,304 --> 00:52:44,104
Watched you go down on
that hoed dirt...

760
00:52:44,264 --> 00:52:47,226
Bet myself a cheese sandwich you
wouldn't get as far as the bottom.

761
00:52:48,826 --> 00:52:51,026
Right, we're stuck. We need a tractor,
to pull us out.

762
00:52:54,027 --> 00:52:55,027
'Avin' a day in the country, are you?

763
00:52:55,427 --> 00:52:57,427
Not really. Is there a farm...

764
00:52:57,628 --> 00:52:59,028
near here?

765
00:52:59,347 --> 00:53:01,188
Gettin' close to nature?

766
00:53:01,348 --> 00:53:02,908
Right, right.

767
00:53:03,109 --> 00:53:05,628
We're in rather a hurry, you see.
I have to be in Norwich by 5.00.

768
00:53:06,469 --> 00:53:09,510
Norwich? You're goin' to Norwich?

769
00:53:09,670 --> 00:53:13,230
Yes, so if we can just find
a tractor...

770
00:53:13,831 --> 00:53:14,991
What? Short cut is it?

771
00:53:16,231 --> 00:53:19,992
Lost our way. So we must
quickly find a tractor.

772
00:53:22,353 --> 00:53:26,073
Well, my advice is this...

773
00:53:30,874 --> 00:53:31,374
Yes?

774
00:53:34,074 --> 00:53:34,994
If you're goin' this way...

775
00:53:38,155 --> 00:53:39,476
find a tractor...

776
00:53:39,675 --> 00:53:40,355
A tractor, yes...

777
00:53:42,716 --> 00:53:44,797
and stay on the bloody thing
all the way to Norwich.

778
00:53:48,557 --> 00:53:51,798
Thank you. Thank you very much!

779
00:53:53,678 --> 00:53:55,639
- I'll tell ya' something else...
- Yes, thank you.

780
00:53:57,039 --> 00:53:58,160
Know what I'm sittin' on?

781
00:53:58,359 --> 00:53:59,839
A bomb, I hope.

782
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:02,560
All right, my old dear,

783
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:05,161
You look that way, and I'll look this,

784
00:54:06,241 --> 00:54:08,641
and I bet you a jam tart

785
00:54:09,282 --> 00:54:11,362
I find a tractor first.

786
00:54:32,606 --> 00:54:34,487
Headin' for Norwich, I believe?

787
00:54:36,687 --> 00:54:37,527
Some of us.

788
00:54:39,288 --> 00:54:41,168
You dodged the traffic, anyway.

789
00:54:48,050 --> 00:54:55,891
Come on. Come on. Oh, for God's sake.
Turn the record player down.

790
00:54:59,972 --> 00:55:02,092
Ah, right. There you are.

791
00:55:02,572 --> 00:55:04,732
Now, a tractor. I'm looking for
a tractor.

792
00:55:04,892 --> 00:55:06,693
You don't have a tractor here, do you?

793
00:55:10,454 --> 00:55:14,974
I'm so sorry, but it is rather urgent.
I have to be in Norwich by...

794
00:55:21,776 --> 00:55:23,296
Of course, a monastery.

795
00:55:24,376 --> 00:55:26,017
I might have guessed.

796
00:56:07,825 --> 00:56:09,706
Have they found a tractor?

797
00:56:18,267 --> 00:56:20,828
Well, it doesn't matter.
Wasn't important.

798
00:56:33,470 --> 00:56:36,991
I'm sorry to let them down, that's all.
It doesn't matter to me.

799
00:56:40,751 --> 00:56:42,072
It was important for the school.

800
00:56:42,752 --> 00:56:44,713
Would've meant so much to the children.

801
00:56:46,794 --> 00:56:51,394
Well... I suppose we couldn't ring for a taxi?

802
00:56:54,954 --> 00:56:55,594
No phone?

803
00:57:01,195 --> 00:57:03,036
It would have meant a lot to
my mother, of course,

804
00:57:06,077 --> 00:57:06,917
if she'd been alive.

805
00:57:09,678 --> 00:57:13,638
I mean, I'd be happy to enter a monastery
and never speak again

806
00:57:14,518 --> 00:57:16,038
We speak.

807
00:57:18,119 --> 00:57:23,079
I'm sorry, I... I just assumed...
I'm sorry.

808
00:57:37,562 --> 00:57:39,003
What do you think I should do then?

809
00:57:40,804 --> 00:57:42,404
Have a bath, perhaps?

810
00:58:06,849 --> 00:58:07,529
They're women!

811
00:58:13,290 --> 00:58:15,570
Funny ol' boyfriend you girls have
found yourselves.

812
00:58:15,771 --> 00:58:19,851
Takes you for nature study in the country,
then slips off and enters a monastery!

813
00:58:22,772 --> 00:58:25,232
- Right, I'm off.
- Mr Stimpson?

814
00:58:25,252 --> 00:58:26,812
Are you coming with me,
or aren't you.

815
00:58:27,092 --> 00:58:27,892
This is our car!

816
00:58:28,052 --> 00:58:29,413
I'm not waiting.

817
00:58:31,314 --> 00:58:37,314
Mr Stimpson? Mr Stimpson?

818
00:58:48,715 --> 00:58:50,315
Mr Stimpson!

819
00:59:25,716 --> 00:59:27,516
<i>Mr Stimpson!</i>

820
00:59:38,617 --> 00:59:40,217
<i>Mr Stimpson!</i>

821
00:59:41,707 --> 00:59:43,347
Quick, where are you?

822
00:59:44,828 --> 00:59:46,268
It's your friend, she won't wait.

823
00:59:46,668 --> 00:59:48,109
They can't find a tractor.

824
00:59:48,469 --> 00:59:50,669
We've got one. It's pulled us out.

825
00:59:52,829 --> 00:59:54,030
What are you doing?

826
00:59:54,350 --> 00:59:55,790
I'm having a bath.

827
00:59:56,351 --> 00:59:58,030
- You've got one?
- She's going.

828
00:59:58,470 --> 00:59:59,390
I'll be right down.

829
01:00:14,594 --> 01:00:15,474
Well?

830
01:00:15,674 --> 01:00:17,114
He's having a bath.

831
01:00:17,875 --> 01:00:21,395
A bath? Why not a sauna and
massage as well?

832
01:00:21,715 --> 01:00:22,915
Again?

833
01:00:28,216 --> 01:00:29,016
Mr Stimpson?

834
01:00:30,237 --> 01:00:31,397
Where is she?

835
01:00:32,117 --> 01:00:35,838
She's gone. I said he's having
a bath, and she went.

836
01:00:37,598 --> 01:00:38,879
Stop her!

837
01:00:39,078 --> 01:00:41,039
It's our car!

838
01:00:55,962 --> 01:00:57,322
End of the lane.

839
01:01:20,407 --> 01:01:22,287
Ah, can't... can't...

840
01:01:22,768 --> 01:01:24,248
Sandal...

841
01:01:25,687 --> 01:01:28,649
We found the road, anyway.

842
01:01:31,769 --> 01:01:33,809
It's not the despair, Laura,

843
01:01:34,650 --> 01:01:37,410
I can stand the despair;
it's the hope.

844
01:01:40,691 --> 01:01:41,531
There!

845
01:01:52,253 --> 01:01:58,455
Blue Morris 1100, registration number
Romeo Delta Xray 364 Juliet.

846
01:01:59,854 --> 01:02:03,816
We've also got Mrs Garden, reported
missing, believed kidnapped.

847
01:02:04,216 --> 01:02:06,336
State of shock, otherwise
appears all right.

848
01:02:06,536 --> 01:02:07,576
No sign of the girl.

849
01:02:07,896 --> 01:02:09,496
She's at the monastery.

850
01:02:10,257 --> 01:02:12,257
Oh, she's apparently in a monastery.

851
01:02:12,417 --> 01:02:13,897
No sign of the male suspect.

852
01:02:14,458 --> 01:02:15,858
He's in the bath.

853
01:02:16,778 --> 01:02:18,219
He's in the bath.

854
01:02:18,459 --> 01:02:19,778
In the monastery?

855
01:02:21,499 --> 01:02:24,019
In the bath, in a monastery.

856
01:02:24,900 --> 01:02:27,060
It's gonna take a bit of sorting out,
this one!

857
01:02:27,220 --> 01:02:28,860
We'll bring Mrs Garden in anyway.

858
01:02:29,340 --> 01:02:31,381
We're charging her with taking
and driving away,

859
01:02:31,621 --> 01:02:33,941
driving a vehicle in an
unroadworthy condition,

860
01:02:34,141 --> 01:02:37,703
exceeding the speed limit, and
assaulting a police officer.

861
01:02:40,943 --> 01:02:42,263
Nearly there...

862
01:02:44,544 --> 01:02:46,064
One little slip, Laura, that's all.

863
01:02:47,064 --> 01:02:49,185
Said 'right', meant 'left'.

864
01:02:49,985 --> 01:02:51,425
One word!

865
01:02:52,345 --> 01:02:53,746
Going!

866
01:02:57,946 --> 01:02:59,386
Gone!

867
01:03:16,110 --> 01:03:18,590
I've lied for this, Laura...
I've stolen,

868
01:03:20,031 --> 01:03:22,432
I've taken you out of school...

869
01:03:24,791 --> 01:03:27,992
Well, I suppose this is a form of education;
it's an education for me, Laura.

870
01:03:30,713 --> 01:03:31,953
You still haven't had any lunch.

871
01:03:34,874 --> 01:03:35,513
We'll get something.

872
01:03:39,874 --> 01:03:41,355
In your suit.

873
01:03:46,236 --> 01:03:47,116
In the bathroom.

874
01:03:47,596 --> 01:03:49,516
I've even lost the time.

875
01:04:08,417 --> 01:04:11,117
He's only a third in geography, but he can
read a balance sheet.

876
01:04:11,818 --> 01:04:14,718
Our merchant bankers thought we
could reckon on 15%.

877
01:04:15,121 --> 01:04:18,082
The Old Boys' Association raised
a quarter of a million, in 3 months...

878
01:04:18,362 --> 01:04:20,863
You know, our people suggested
floating the school off.

879
01:04:21,164 --> 01:04:23,464
We're offering an A level in classic Arabic,
of course.

880
01:04:24,564 --> 01:04:27,084
... and we hope the school mosque will
finished in time for Ramadan.

881
01:04:27,085 --> 01:04:28,485
One in the eye for Millfield, anyway.

882
01:04:28,884 --> 01:04:31,604
We're also planning a Deutsche Mark
offshore fund.

883
01:04:31,605 --> 01:04:34,605
We have to be prepared for any
political eventuality.

884
01:04:34,846 --> 01:04:37,646
...but we do have the same
accountants as Mick Jagger.

885
01:04:38,166 --> 01:04:41,407
... so anyway an air crew came down and
checked out our security arrangements,

886
01:04:41,408 --> 01:04:42,408
with particular reference to the bombs.

887
01:04:44,567 --> 01:04:46,048
Did you ring the school?

888
01:04:46,368 --> 01:04:48,008
They say he left at 10.00

889
01:04:48,328 --> 01:04:50,648
He said he was going to
be here by 3.00

890
01:04:53,969 --> 01:04:57,410
I'm sorry, I'm... just ...

891
01:04:58,570 --> 01:04:59,931
I don't know... whether...

892
01:05:02,050 --> 01:05:04,451
Extraordinary appointments some
governors make these days.

893
01:05:05,812 --> 01:05:08,252
Or is that the state sector?

894
01:05:08,492 --> 01:05:11,173
The chap over there came on
a motor cycle by the look of it.

895
01:05:15,413 --> 01:05:16,053
Good God!

896
01:05:17,133 --> 01:05:18,014
There's some woman!

897
01:05:18,494 --> 01:05:21,154
- How did she get in?
- Excuse me.

898
01:05:21,455 --> 01:05:24,936
And at Easter I'm taking the
Classical sixth to Jamaica.

899
01:05:25,616 --> 01:05:26,735
Can I help you at all?

900
01:05:26,936 --> 01:05:28,256
Where is she? Where's Laura?

901
01:05:28,456 --> 01:05:29,057
I'm sorry?

902
01:05:29,296 --> 01:05:31,857
Our daughter! He's going mad, and
he'll have one of his attacks.

903
01:05:32,057 --> 01:05:33,777
Oh! Oh dear. Your daughter?

904
01:05:33,977 --> 01:05:36,658
Well, let's go and have a look for
her, shall we?

905
01:05:37,017 --> 01:05:40,378
I'm sorry, someone should explain.
We don't bring wives and families.

906
01:05:40,618 --> 01:05:42,459
Wives? No, you have 18-year-old girls

907
01:05:42,699 --> 01:05:45,179
who are doing their A levels.
I've never heard anything like it.

908
01:05:45,699 --> 01:05:47,900
Well, let's go upstairs and
discuss it in peace, shall we?

909
01:05:48,100 --> 01:05:49,160
And where is he?
Where's Mr Stimpson?

910
01:05:49,461 --> 01:05:54,361
Mr Stimpson? Ah! Mr Stimpson.

911
01:05:54,521 --> 01:05:57,021
Well, I think you'll like our new
prospectus. It's been done by...

912
01:05:57,022 --> 01:05:58,222
Excuse me one moment.

913
01:05:58,322 --> 01:06:01,923
Anyway, we're hoping the new solarium will
give our sixth form a bit more appeal

914
01:06:02,024 --> 01:06:04,024
- at the top end of the market.
- I'm so sorry.

915
01:06:04,025 --> 01:06:05,303
Would you take these good people

916
01:06:05,503 --> 01:06:08,224
and upstairs, to the room along
the corridor, on the left.

917
01:06:08,424 --> 01:06:09,824
Terrific! Delighted!

918
01:06:10,024 --> 01:06:13,785
See that they have some tea.
I'll be with you in one minute.

919
01:06:14,625 --> 01:06:15,465
Can I help you?

920
01:06:15,625 --> 01:06:17,306
I'm looking for Mr Stimpson.

921
01:06:17,505 --> 01:06:20,186
Oh, we're all looking for Mr Stimpson.
Come with me.

922
01:06:20,986 --> 01:06:22,986
So of course I said:
"I don't drink sherry

923
01:06:23,227 --> 01:06:26,668
"I'm a total abstainer, as you very
well know

924
01:06:26,908 --> 01:06:29,508
"But I do not see why the sherry glasses
should go to Pam, just because she drinks."

925
01:06:29,668 --> 01:06:31,309
Why don't you have a cup of tea?

926
01:06:31,508 --> 01:06:33,469
I told you to stay in the car!

927
01:06:33,669 --> 01:06:36,029
You're another of Mr Stimpson's party,
are you?

928
01:06:36,230 --> 01:06:39,990
Pour them some tea, and take them upstairs,
the room along the corridor on the left.

929
01:06:40,310 --> 01:06:41,110
Very well.

930
01:06:41,311 --> 01:06:42,431
What are you doing here?

931
01:06:42,711 --> 01:06:47,431
Oh, I'm just... I'll... fetch you
a cup of...

932
01:06:53,793 --> 01:06:55,913
He seems to have brought his
entire family.

933
01:06:56,113 --> 01:06:57,553
There's another one here.

934
01:06:57,713 --> 01:07:00,234
Let me guess. You're looking for
Mr Stimpson.

935
01:07:00,555 --> 01:07:02,555
I'm looking for the head doctor.

936
01:07:02,715 --> 01:07:05,075
Well let's see what we can find upstairs.

937
01:07:05,995 --> 01:07:07,315
Mr Stimpson?

938
01:07:08,556 --> 01:07:09,916
Am I?

939
01:07:10,236 --> 01:07:12,516
I don't know where I am or
what I am.

940
01:07:12,916 --> 01:07:14,037
I know the feeling.

941
01:07:18,118 --> 01:07:20,158
Why don't you both make yourselves
comfortable in here?

942
01:07:21,358 --> 01:07:23,758
I'll bring Mr Stimpson to you just as
soon as I've found him.

943
01:07:23,959 --> 01:07:26,399
Terrible bore, I know, but it is
a private meeting.

944
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:31,200
As a matter of fact, I say it would be
an unfair temptation to put

945
01:07:31,561 --> 01:07:33,520
a sherry glass in her hand.

946
01:07:33,681 --> 01:07:35,201
Mr Stimpson's party?

947
01:07:35,361 --> 01:07:36,281
In here.

948
01:07:39,802 --> 01:07:41,163
Two more for you.

949
01:07:42,162 --> 01:07:44,483
Terrific! Super!

950
01:07:45,163 --> 01:07:47,204
This is the most exciting day!

951
01:07:52,245 --> 01:07:54,565
Detective Sergeant Rice,
Norwich CID.

952
01:07:54,965 --> 01:07:57,125
I believe you have a
Mr Brian Stimpson here.

953
01:07:58,646 --> 01:07:59,806
Nothing wrong, I hope.

954
01:07:59,966 --> 01:08:01,126
We'd just like a word with him, sir.

955
01:08:01,327 --> 01:08:04,366
Well he hasn't arrived yet.
We're waiting for him.

956
01:08:04,527 --> 01:08:06,287
We'll wait too then.
If we may.

957
01:08:08,087 --> 01:08:09,768
I'll bring you some tea.

958
01:08:10,929 --> 01:08:13,209
Stimpson supporters club?
In here.

959
01:08:16,569 --> 01:08:17,210
Do you take sugar?

960
01:08:21,130 --> 01:08:23,530
- Police looking for him now.
- Oh no!

961
01:08:24,971 --> 01:08:26,171
Little boys?

962
01:08:27,971 --> 01:08:29,692
Well, if he's not here by 5.00...

963
01:08:30,772 --> 01:08:33,573
I suppose one of us could
say a few words.

964
01:08:34,173 --> 01:08:35,733
Yes, I could have a go, if you like.

965
01:08:36,574 --> 01:08:38,214
Something about money, perhaps?

966
01:08:38,614 --> 01:08:40,174
Usually a reliable standby.

967
01:08:40,934 --> 01:08:43,214
I hope he's not lying in
some ditch.

968
01:08:43,715 --> 01:08:44,915
Oh, absolutely.

969
01:08:47,175 --> 01:08:50,376
It was going to be the start of so much,
Laura. I was going to go into politics.

970
01:08:50,576 --> 01:08:51,656
I used to think:

971
01:08:52,617 --> 01:08:56,057
"When I become Secretary of State
for Education..."

972
01:08:59,657 --> 01:09:01,018
Don't laugh!

973
01:09:11,740 --> 01:09:13,420
I thought I didn't mind.

974
01:09:16,141 --> 01:09:19,701
When I was in the monastery, I thought
I'd resigned myself to it, but really...

975
01:09:20,822 --> 01:09:23,262
I knew I'd still got time, you see.

976
01:09:24,823 --> 01:09:26,944
Funny how you always know secretly

977
01:09:27,103 --> 01:09:30,184
when the last moment is,
and when it's gone.

978
01:09:32,744 --> 01:09:34,224
And now it has,

979
01:09:36,546 --> 01:09:41,466
I mind, Laura. I mind.

980
01:09:51,308 --> 01:09:52,308
Mr Stimpson

981
01:09:52,309 --> 01:09:53,988
Perhaps I could just...

982
01:09:54,828 --> 01:09:55,949
lying here...

983
01:09:55,950 --> 01:09:56,950
Mr Stimpson!

984
01:10:01,190 --> 01:10:02,390
Wait!

985
01:10:14,073 --> 01:10:15,713
Hop up then darling, what's the trouble?

986
01:10:15,953 --> 01:10:17,233
Does this seat tip up?

987
01:10:17,473 --> 01:10:21,434
Don't worry about the car. It's brand new.
Only got 12 miles on the clock.

988
01:10:22,034 --> 01:10:22,994
What? You pull this lever?

989
01:10:25,715 --> 01:10:27,115
- What's all this.
- We're together.

990
01:10:27,755 --> 01:10:28,516
I don't believe this!

991
01:10:28,755 --> 01:10:29,915
He's got to get to Norwich.

992
01:10:30,355 --> 01:10:33,556
Well, I've seen them pull some stunts,
but... a monk?

993
01:10:40,038 --> 01:10:42,119
Okay. A monk! What can I do?

994
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:55,121
I'm surprised at you though, Father.

995
01:10:55,481 --> 01:10:59,201
Putting a bird out at the side of the road,
hiding in the ditch.

996
01:10:59,642 --> 01:11:02,322
Does your Father Superior know you
travel around like this?

997
01:11:04,203 --> 01:11:07,063
Funny! You!

998
01:11:07,083 --> 01:11:09,443
Speech... Like that?

999
01:11:10,924 --> 01:11:11,604
What?

1000
01:11:24,686 --> 01:11:27,808
Frankly, Father, I'm shocked, 
do you know that?

1001
01:11:28,007 --> 01:11:30,208
I'm not easily shocked, 
but I'm shocked.

1002
01:11:30,368 --> 01:11:31,527
- Can we stop?
- What?

1003
01:11:32,168 --> 01:11:34,209
Stop a moment. By these trees.

1004
01:11:42,370 --> 01:11:43,530
What's the trouble?

1005
01:11:43,730 --> 01:11:46,691
- Go for a little walk.
- Go for a walk?

1006
01:11:47,051 --> 01:11:48,531
In the woods.

1007
01:11:50,852 --> 01:11:52,052
You... wanna go for a walk?

1008
01:11:52,212 --> 01:11:53,173
Don't you want to come?

1009
01:11:54,773 --> 01:11:55,893
What... you mean? What?

1010
01:11:57,653 --> 01:11:59,173
No one around!

1011
01:12:01,973 --> 01:12:03,294
Well, this beats everything.

1012
01:12:04,854 --> 01:12:07,295
Sorry about this, Father.
Five minutes, that's all.

1013
01:12:07,495 --> 01:12:08,895
Pick a few flowers.

1014
01:12:13,296 --> 01:12:14,136
Come on then.

1015
01:12:14,297 --> 01:12:15,257
Him?

1016
01:12:17,137 --> 01:12:19,057
Do you want him to come?
Do you want Father there?

1017
01:12:19,337 --> 01:12:22,258
Come on! The sun's out.

1018
01:12:28,619 --> 01:12:30,139
It's a funny old world, isn't it?

1019
01:12:39,501 --> 01:12:42,102
Look, I'll be frank. I'm out of my depth.

1020
01:12:45,102 --> 01:12:46,623
We could take our clothes off.

1021
01:13:00,705 --> 01:13:01,346
Go on then.

1022
01:13:01,706 --> 01:13:02,426
You first.

1023
01:13:11,527 --> 01:13:12,227
Go on.

1024
01:13:21,128 --> 01:13:22,928
Shoes.

1025
01:13:28,111 --> 01:13:28,791
Now you.

1026
01:13:29,911 --> 01:13:32,312
Now, Mr Stimpson.

1027
01:13:33,813 --> 01:13:35,613
Come on then.

1028
01:13:38,273 --> 01:13:39,713
Oh, now look, I'm not doing a solo.

1029
01:13:55,236 --> 01:13:57,197
Come on, be a monk.

1030
01:14:27,563 --> 01:14:29,323
Keys, find the keys.

1031
01:14:32,363 --> 01:14:35,044
I knew it! I knew it was a stunt
the moment he got in the car.

1032
01:14:38,365 --> 01:14:39,845
Give it to me! Give it to me!

1033
01:14:45,446 --> 01:14:48,126
Give me that suit!
300 quid that suit cost me.

1034
01:14:53,528 --> 01:14:56,248
You've torn it.

1035
01:14:56,768 --> 01:14:59,169
Monk. Monk? You've torn the sleeve
off a 300-guinea suit.

1036
01:15:01,250 --> 01:15:02,809
Oh no, not the car!

1037
01:15:05,410 --> 01:15:06,770
It's not mine. It's a customer's.

1038
01:15:07,490 --> 01:15:08,690
It's not insured.

1039
01:15:16,333 --> 01:15:17,933
Oh, please, please,
don't drive. Come back!

1040
01:15:27,295 --> 01:15:29,935
I knew it. From the moment she
stuck her thumb up.

1041
01:15:35,936 --> 01:15:36,777
Don't worry about the sleeve. 

1042
01:15:36,976 --> 01:15:40,737
We'll get some sellotape. 
We've got some money now.

1043
01:15:41,738 --> 01:15:43,858
Feel in the pockets. How much
have we got?

1044
01:15:49,499 --> 01:15:51,460
Oh, look! Hundreds and hundreds.

1045
01:15:51,819 --> 01:15:53,340
We could do anything.

1046
01:15:53,620 --> 01:15:55,940
We could get Chinese take-aways.

1047
01:15:57,140 --> 01:15:59,021
I saw this film on television once:

1048
01:15:59,180 --> 01:16:01,742
there was this bloke and this girl, and
they went around everywhere in this car,

1049
01:16:01,902 --> 01:16:03,622
robbing these banks and things.

1050
01:16:03,822 --> 01:16:05,382
Did you see that, Mr Stimpson?

1051
01:16:12,184 --> 01:16:16,544
Don't worry, I'll get you there. I'm  a
better driver than her, anyway.

1052
01:16:19,425 --> 01:16:21,585
We should have taken his 
watch as well.

1053
01:16:22,466 --> 01:16:24,226
Do you know what's worrying me?

1054
01:16:24,946 --> 01:16:27,746
The way I always seem to 
get involved with older men.

1055
01:16:55,232 --> 01:16:57,713
No point in waiting beyond 5.00,
is there?

1056
01:16:57,993 --> 01:17:02,073
I'm going to talk about charitable
status and moral leadership.

1057
01:17:05,594 --> 01:17:08,395
Why can't he keep those 
damned women locked up?

1058
01:17:12,995 --> 01:17:14,316
So kind of you.

1059
01:17:15,156 --> 01:17:17,197
In everyone's way, as usual.

1060
01:17:18,557 --> 01:17:20,157
I'll just sit myself down.

1061
01:17:21,997 --> 01:17:24,797
Oh dear. Lost again, are we?

1062
01:17:25,118 --> 01:17:26,318
Quite, quite lost.

1063
01:17:26,598 --> 01:17:28,398
Let's see if we can find your friends.

1064
01:17:28,559 --> 01:17:30,399
Excuse me, but I am not shouting at you.

1065
01:17:30,559 --> 01:17:31,799
Excuse me, but you are!

1066
01:17:32,040 --> 01:17:34,519
Excuse me, but I'm merely trying to get
 it into your head that he is not here.

1067
01:17:34,960 --> 01:17:36,640
Oh, here they all are.

1068
01:17:36,841 --> 01:17:37,720
So when will he be here?

1069
01:17:37,921 --> 01:17:38,561
I don't know.

1070
01:17:38,721 --> 01:17:40,201
Debating about which
word to do.

1071
01:17:40,441 --> 01:17:42,961
Can't you stop these people
wandering into the hall?

1072
01:17:43,282 --> 01:17:44,922
No I can't. They keep wanting
to go to the loo.

1073
01:17:45,081 --> 01:17:48,763
Mrs Wheel needs to go
to the ladies.

1074
01:17:48,922 --> 01:17:50,162
Do you see? And then they 
don't come back.

1075
01:17:50,363 --> 01:17:51,963
Call yourself a doctor?

1076
01:17:53,483 --> 01:17:55,484
Get me someone to escort them
to the loo.

1077
01:17:55,644 --> 01:17:56,924
Ooh, we're off again, are we?

1078
01:17:57,124 --> 01:17:58,885
Not you, you've been.

1079
01:18:00,565 --> 01:18:03,286
Detective Inspector Laundryman,
regional crime squad.

1080
01:18:04,165 --> 01:18:05,086
Stimpson?

1081
01:18:05,286 --> 01:18:06,646
Thought I might have a few
words with him.

1082
01:18:06,806 --> 01:18:07,806
In here.

1083
01:18:07,326 --> 01:18:09,926
- Stimpson?
- What are you doing here, George?

1084
01:18:10,406 --> 01:18:11,406
Stimpson.

1085
01:18:11,407 --> 01:18:12,648
Takin' n' drivin, and assault?

1086
01:18:12,807 --> 01:18:15,088
No, taking and driving and kidnapping.

1087
01:18:15,248 --> 01:18:16,648
Right, inside then.

1088
01:18:19,209 --> 01:18:20,888
Let's keep the door closed.

1089
01:18:23,409 --> 01:18:24,489
Um, Gentlemen...

1090
01:18:25,990 --> 01:18:30,011
Gentlemen, if I might have your 
attention for one moment...

1091
01:18:30,012 --> 01:18:31,012
Thank you.

1092
01:18:31,971 --> 01:18:33,971
And now the time is...

1093
01:18:35,171 --> 01:18:39,493
is exactly five o'clock, and I'm afraid
I have some bad news for you.

1094
01:18:40,733 --> 01:18:43,253
Our chairman, Mr Stimpson... 

1095
01:18:44,694 --> 01:18:45,614
is here.

1096
01:19:25,582 --> 01:19:28,623
This is a historic moment.

1097
01:19:30,143 --> 01:19:32,063
I stand before you today as 
your new chairman,

1098
01:19:32,663 --> 01:19:38,224
something that some of us never 
expected to see in our lifetime.

1099
01:19:39,585 --> 01:19:41,024
We have come a long way together

1100
01:19:42,465 --> 01:19:44,146
to be where we are today.

1101
01:19:45,986 --> 01:19:46,866
A long way.

1102
01:19:47,587 --> 01:19:48,626
Who is she?

1103
01:19:48,826 --> 01:19:50,427
A long, long way...

1104
01:19:52,107 --> 01:19:56,188
And at this point I should 
perhaps explain that 

1105
01:19:56,387 --> 01:19:57,948
during the course of my journey

1106
01:19:58,468 --> 01:20:00,189
I have become separated...

1107
01:20:01,549 --> 01:20:03,949
separated from the text of my speech.

1108
01:20:04,190 --> 01:20:08,190
So I hope you will forgive me if
I am a little disconnected.

1109
01:20:18,593 --> 01:20:19,872
Right!

1110
01:20:21,433 --> 01:20:24,754
So I stand here today, and I 
look out there

1111
01:20:24,913 --> 01:20:26,474
and what do I see?

1112
01:20:39,316 --> 01:20:40,757
I see myself

1113
01:20:41,357 --> 01:20:43,517
I see myself as I was then,

1114
01:20:45,637 --> 01:20:47,318
an obscure master from an

1115
01:20:47,558 --> 01:20:49,758
overawed comprehensive school.

1116
01:20:53,980 --> 01:20:56,520
Right. So, what was I doing there?

1117
01:20:57,480 --> 01:20:59,640
I was amazed to find herself...

1118
01:21:00,320 --> 01:21:01,601
Um, I was amazed to find myself

1119
01:21:02,481 --> 01:21:05,801
invited to become one of your
very select handful

1120
01:21:06,002 --> 01:21:07,802
of additional women.

1121
01:21:11,442 --> 01:21:13,563
And I was even more amazed still

1122
01:21:13,763 --> 01:21:15,963
at what I was listening to,

1123
01:21:16,123 --> 01:21:19,204
because what I was listening to was

1124
01:21:24,085 --> 01:21:25,845
Well, come in then if you're coming!

1125
01:21:26,086 --> 01:21:28,606
No, because what I was listening to was

1126
01:21:31,086 --> 01:21:32,406
Are there any more of you out there?

1127
01:21:45,849 --> 01:21:48,130
All right. Find yourselves somewhere
 to sit.

1128
01:21:54,130 --> 01:21:54,830
Right.

1129
01:21:54,931 --> 01:21:59,932
There I was listening to the headmasters 
of schools with great and glorious names

1130
01:22:03,493 --> 01:22:04,533
So kind of you.

1131
01:22:09,374 --> 01:22:10,614
Oh, sit down!

1132
01:22:14,015 --> 01:22:15,576
Yes, we're all waiting for you!

1133
01:22:21,296 --> 01:22:23,996
Thank you.

1134
01:22:24,097 --> 01:22:26,278
Right, so there I was, 

1135
01:22:26,279 --> 01:22:30,379
 listening to the headmasters of schools
with great and glorious names as they

1136
01:22:33,379 --> 01:22:37,660
kicked around a variety of 
weighty topics,

1137
01:22:38,500 --> 01:22:42,861
as they expatiated upon a variety 
of weighty balls.

1138
01:22:46,541 --> 01:22:47,861
I'm glad someone finds that funny.

1139
01:22:49,062 --> 01:22:50,782
Did he say what I think he said?

1140
01:22:50,942 --> 01:22:52,903
There's no need to whisper.

1141
01:22:53,063 --> 01:22:55,944
Please come up here and explain the 
joke to the entire school.

1142
01:22:58,703 --> 01:22:59,904
And who's that creaking?

1143
01:23:04,105 --> 01:23:05,385
Come on, come on. Let's get it
over with.

1144
01:23:05,486 --> 01:23:07,186
There's a seat down here, look.

1145
01:23:16,788 --> 01:23:18,228
Long way to Norwich, was it?

1146
01:23:21,268 --> 01:23:22,389
Long way to that seat, too.

1147
01:23:28,390 --> 01:23:30,911
Make yourself comfortable then.
Get all the creaking over.

1148
01:23:34,551 --> 01:23:35,351
No rush.

1149
01:23:35,551 --> 01:23:37,872
We've got all the time in the world.

1150
01:23:39,072 --> 01:23:40,992
Time! Right, because I should like,

1151
01:23:41,432 --> 01:23:44,153
before I pass on, before I pass on
to other matters,

1152
01:23:44,353 --> 01:23:46,633
to sound a note of warning.

1153
01:23:49,914 --> 01:23:51,434
And still they come.

1154
01:23:52,595 --> 01:23:56,275
I was just talking, you might be
interested to hear, about time.

1155
01:23:56,635 --> 01:23:57,835
I was going to say that

1156
01:23:58,036 --> 01:24:00,236
we all understood that lateness

1157
01:24:00,396 --> 01:24:02,717
was a discourtesy to others.

1158
01:24:02,916 --> 01:24:05,237
But I'm beginning to wonder.

1159
01:24:07,357 --> 01:24:08,878
You're beginning to wonder too,
are you?

1160
01:24:09,438 --> 01:24:13,339
So perhaps the rest of us could
turn round and face the front,

1161
01:24:13,399 --> 01:24:15,879
and we'll all wonder together.

1162
01:24:16,899 --> 01:24:18,799
Right, thank you.

1163
01:24:18,800 --> 01:24:20,760
Because I'm beginning to wonder

1164
01:24:21,720 --> 01:24:24,361
if I'd be the only person in the world

1165
01:24:24,521 --> 01:24:27,361
who'd be slightly surprised
if the tide came wandering in

1166
01:24:27,521 --> 01:24:30,802
half an hour after the lesson
 had started,

1167
01:24:30,803 --> 01:24:32,403
slammed all the doors,

1168
01:24:32,442 --> 01:24:34,542
and stood there gazing 
round the room

1169
01:24:34,643 --> 01:24:37,284
trying to find some chums
to sit next to

1170
01:24:37,444 --> 01:24:38,844
while the rest of us

1171
01:24:39,044 --> 01:24:42,125
patiently wait to get on 
with the day's events.

1172
01:24:41,664 --> 01:24:43,765
Perhaps I sound a little old fashioned,

1173
01:24:43,865 --> 01:24:45,645
but imagine a spacecraft

1174
01:24:45,746 --> 01:24:51,447
that was endlessly interrupted by
latecomers and flapping doors.

1175
01:24:53,126 --> 01:24:57,567
It might just possibly go
completely mad!

1176
01:24:58,327 --> 01:24:59,688
It might just possibly

1177
01:24:59,888 --> 01:25:02,488
lift off the launch pad and go

1178
01:25:02,728 --> 01:25:05,849
streaming off into the depths
of the universe.

1179
01:25:06,249 --> 01:25:10,170
and never been seen again until
the end of time.

1180
01:25:59,340 --> 01:26:01,340
Right. Hymn 122:

1181
01:26:02,300 --> 01:26:04,661
"He Who Would Valiant Be".

1182
01:27:24,886 --> 01:27:27,000
Mr Stimpson!

1183
01:27:50,701 --> 01:27:52,001
Excuse me, sir.

1184
01:27:52,002 --> 01:27:53,602
Mr Stimpson? Mr Stimpson?

1185
01:27:53,803 --> 01:27:55,803
Brian? Brian, stay there.

1186
01:27:56,004 --> 01:28:00,304
- Mr Stimpson?
- Laura! Laura!

1187
01:28:00,305 --> 01:28:01,105
Excuse me.

1188
01:28:01,106 --> 01:28:02,506
Are you Mr Brian Stimpson of...

1189
01:28:11,607 --> 01:28:13,507
I want to have a word with my husband.

1190
01:28:18,307 --> 01:28:20,907
This is my lovely day,

1191
01:28:22,008 --> 01:28:25,008
this is the day I will remember,

1192
01:28:25,009 --> 01:28:28,309
the day I'm dying.

1193
01:28:28,310 --> 01:28:32,010
They can't take this away,

1194
01:28:32,011 --> 01:28:36,511
it will be always mine,
the sun and the wine,

1195
01:28:36,512 --> 01:28:40,212
the seabirds flying...

1196
01:28:51,173 --> 01:28:52,173
Where are they going now?

1197
01:28:52,174 --> 01:28:55,414
Both seen driving away, silver Porsche
sports coupé

1198
01:28:55,574 --> 01:28:57,135
Furthermore, there are also

1199
01:28:57,375 --> 01:29:00,576
various charges relating to the 
theft of certain items of gents' clothing

1200
01:29:01,055 --> 01:29:03,376
including an ecclesiastical vestment,

1201
01:29:03,576 --> 01:29:05,176
and of a wallet containing

1202
01:29:05,377 --> 01:29:07,857
approximately £1,230 in cash.

1203
01:29:08,537 --> 01:29:11,818
Do you wish to say anything? You're not
 obliged to unless you wish to do so.

1204
01:29:12,018 --> 01:29:15,539
but whatever you say will be taken down
in writing and may be given in evidence.

1205
01:29:15,899 --> 01:29:17,539
Go right, right.

1206
01:29:19,500 --> 01:29:22,260
- Right?
- Eh? No, no left. Left!

1207
01:29:28,661 --> 01:29:35,261
My lovely day, my lovely day.
