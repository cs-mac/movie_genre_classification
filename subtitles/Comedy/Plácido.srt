00:03:18,679 --> 00:03:22,510
The events and characters in this
film are imaginary. Any similarity to
others in real

2
00:03:22,518 --> 00:03:26,936
life will be simple coincidence. The
Producer, director and writers
decline any responsibility asked of
them.

3
00:03:28,916 --> 00:03:36,108
We need the attention of everybody,
the poor and the rich, because for
Christmas there are no borders.

4
00:03:36,109 --> 00:03:41,280
Everybody who goes must enroll in
our campaign "dine with a poor man"

5
00:03:41,281 --> 00:03:44,282
That for one night we all be human
beings.

6
00:03:44,283 --> 00:03:48,185
That for one night the black hearted
be generous.

7
00:03:48,426 --> 00:03:51,093
That for one night the poor will dine.

8
00:03:58,279 --> 00:04:01,371
- A moment -But really, what are
you doing

9
00:04:02,224 --> 00:04:05,700
- A moment -Listen, come here -I'll
just speak with my wife and I'll be
back

10
00:04:05,701 --> 00:04:09,474
But, what do you mean with your
wife? Come Come on right away

11
00:04:09,801 --> 00:04:12,161
Be careful, that's the women's
washroom

12
00:04:12,949 --> 00:04:13,993
Emilia

13
00:04:14,467 --> 00:04:16,313
Guard that right

14
00:04:16,314 --> 00:04:20,666
Did you pick up the note from the
bank? What am I going to pick up?
It's almost 7000 pesetas.

15
00:04:20,667 --> 00:04:22,256
What, yes, son yes Take this

16
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,002
Let go you

17
00:04:24,323 --> 00:04:28,472
Ahh, what happened is that the first
one is bigger since he put the
leftover interest

18
00:04:29,231 --> 00:04:30,273
A turn

19
00:04:30,339 --> 00:04:32,368
- Is it all there? - Do you have
today's paper?

20
00:04:32,374 --> 00:04:33,416
It's busy

21
00:04:33,862 --> 00:04:36,742
No don't bother counting I took
everything from the register

22
00:04:36,767 --> 00:04:38,676
and not even adding my bonus pay
is enough

23
00:04:38,709 --> 00:04:40,516
- Out of here -I called the shelter
but...

24
00:04:40,641 --> 00:04:44,010
I wasn't at the shelter, I was
mounting that star on the motor car

25
00:04:44,135 --> 00:04:45,512
What did they tell you at the bank?

26
00:04:45,513 --> 00:04:47,952
That if we went soon this afternoon
we could fix it.

27
00:04:47,976 --> 00:04:51,772
And if not we'd have to go to the
notary for the, I don't know, the
protesting the impound.

28
00:04:51,784 --> 00:04:54,527
What a pain Mother of god, And
precisely today

29
00:04:54,528 --> 00:04:57,372
I asked your brother for money but
he doesn't want anything to do with it

30
00:04:57,396 --> 00:04:59,091
What do you mean no? Julian, come
here

31
00:04:59,216 --> 00:05:00,393
Don't count on me Come

32
00:05:00,427 --> 00:05:02,035
I said no, I don't have money

33
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,298
You have to realize if I don't pay right
now it's certain they'll impound the
motorcar, man.

34
00:05:06,304 --> 00:05:08,101
I'll get it back to you tomorrow, I
swear.

35
00:05:08,226 --> 00:05:13,677
No, I need those 40 bucks. I need
them much more than you guys,
man.

36
00:05:13,802 --> 00:05:17,783
Besides, I'm an invalid, you have a
business, a salary.

37
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:18,969
It's not enough.

38
00:05:19,002 --> 00:05:22,206
- Listen, this can't be... Go to the
men's room, you scoundrel

39
00:05:22,208 --> 00:05:24,998
- No, l-l-I
- Mr. Quintanilla, you have to pay
me right away.

40
00:05:25,123 --> 00:05:27,599
Look, look, a bank note A NOTE.

41
00:05:27,724 --> 00:05:30,219
It's the same to you to pay me now
or after the parade

42
00:05:30,344 --> 00:05:32,460
No, listen, this is a matter for the
charity women

43
00:05:32,585 --> 00:05:35,042
Now they're at the station, waiting for
the actors from Madrid

44
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:37,681
I'm sure they'll pay you there -I won't
get to the bank

45
00:05:37,714 --> 00:05:40,584
Talk to them, tell them that the rest
you'll get to them soon.

46
00:05:40,606 --> 00:05:42,984
Yeah but... what a mess, mother
what a mess

47
00:05:42,985 --> 00:05:45,173
Let's go Julian, man Listen, where?

48
00:05:45,196 --> 00:05:48,668
This afternoon I got a small job I
have to deliver Christmas baskets

49
00:05:48,702 --> 00:05:51,124
You lout, don't you realize I'm at the
edge of ruin

50
00:05:51,158 --> 00:05:52,980
I'd hit you Watch it, watch it

51
00:05:53,014 --> 00:05:54,680
Let's go Mr. Quintanilla To the
station, eh!

52
00:05:54,704 --> 00:05:55,948
No, to the bank. Excuse me,

53
00:05:55,957 --> 00:05:57,417
It's right next door, let's go.

54
00:05:57,542 --> 00:05:59,260
But isn't this the Women's?

55
00:05:59,385 --> 00:06:01,716
Yes, come in, don't be afraid, we're
the workers.

56
00:06:01,745 --> 00:06:04,697
Come Mr. Quintanilla. - Yes Listen
Placido, who'll pick up my father?

57
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:06,751
You go. Today the bus arrives at 5
eh.

58
00:06:06,752 --> 00:06:10,861
Go ahead, miss, that way on the
right, whichever you want.

59
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,680
It's cold.

60
00:06:24,579 --> 00:06:26,158
Sirs. One each.

61
00:06:26,654 --> 00:06:29,527
- Best wishes, Mr. Rodolfo. - Thank
you and happy holidays.

62
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:30,583
Thanks

63
00:06:33,683 --> 00:06:35,733
Thank you -You're welcome

64
00:06:36,035 --> 00:06:39,170
This is something personal A bonus
from me.

65
00:06:39,171 --> 00:06:42,563
The one from the bank will arrive in
due time, don't worry.

66
00:06:42,688 --> 00:06:45,974
Remember that last year it came on
a day like today

67
00:06:46,099 --> 00:06:49,419
- you're welcome-but maybe this
year it'll wait until after Christmas

68
00:06:49,544 --> 00:06:51,080
You already know...

69
00:06:51,459 --> 00:06:54,241
Jimenez, Aren't you ashamed!

70
00:06:54,269 --> 00:06:57,215
But, I, since it's Christmas I was
taking one for my father.

71
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:59,149
I only want serious people working
here.

72
00:06:59,372 --> 00:07:01,596
Jimenez! Don't you hear the bell

73
00:07:02,164 --> 00:07:04,903
Heh, maybe it's the bonus from the
central office.

74
00:07:05,029 --> 00:07:08,375
Last year they sent it by courier,
right?

75
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:09,834
Yes sir.

76
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:12,570
It's closed. Public opening is in the
morning.

77
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,357
- Ask them if it's to deposit, idiot.
- Yes sir.

78
00:07:16,172 --> 00:07:17,535
Is it to deposit?

79
00:07:18,473 --> 00:07:19,689
Oh, OK

80
00:07:20,754 --> 00:07:21,926
Pass this way

81
00:07:23,077 --> 00:07:24,841
This way Mr. Quintanilla

82
00:07:24,966 --> 00:07:27,852
- Afternoon, it's a bank note, where?
- There.

83
00:07:27,978 --> 00:07:29,539
Oh, there. Thank you.

84
00:07:31,682 --> 00:07:34,327
I have here a bank note, I've come
to pay Over there.

85
00:07:34,573 --> 00:07:37,017
Good evening, I've come to pick up
a bank note

86
00:07:37,288 --> 00:07:39,865
- You haven't taken it to the notary,
right? - Give Here

87
00:07:39,866 --> 00:07:42,089
I don't know why you people don't
pay before twelve.

88
00:07:42,214 --> 00:07:43,833
You want to annoy us. N-No.

89
00:07:43,842 --> 00:07:47,055
If you're prepared to pay why don't
you do it like God intended -But I'm
not here to pay.

90
00:07:47,062 --> 00:07:49,856
You see, it's that I'm missing a small
amount, a few pesetas

91
00:07:49,863 --> 00:07:52,583
I'm going to get them right now, and
I'll be back in a bit, eh. - But, man.

92
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:55,606
I was afraid you'd take it to the
notary, that's why I brought my
brother.

93
00:07:55,866 --> 00:08:00,166
This one. I leave my brother here so
you trust me, and I send you the rest
right away

94
00:08:00,168 --> 00:08:01,516
If you pay you pay, if not.

95
00:08:01,517 --> 00:08:05,534
Remember me? I'm Quintanilla's
son. The butcher.

96
00:08:05,535 --> 00:08:08,884
Oh I see it. Happy holidays. A small
deposit?

97
00:08:09,009 --> 00:08:12,133
Well, no, it's not for me. Do
something sir, this man has...

98
00:08:12,258 --> 00:08:14,824
- Yes, I heard. A bank note with
expenses. - Yes, here it is.

99
00:08:14,949 --> 00:08:18,688
We have to take it to the notary with
time, so he can proceed with it
before sunset.

100
00:08:18,813 --> 00:08:20,282
That's the legislation.

101
00:08:20,407 --> 00:08:25,098
I know, but this man has to come
with me to the station to welcome the
actors from Madrid

102
00:08:25,223 --> 00:08:27,382
- Magnificent idea. - For the
campaign, you know,

103
00:08:27,387 --> 00:08:30,966
Here' we've all requested poor men,
right? We have to buy tenderness,
yes sir.

104
00:08:31,091 --> 00:08:33,323
Exactly, that's what I'm saying, he's
working with me.

105
00:08:33,353 --> 00:08:36,230
Receives the money from the charity
ladies and when he gets the money.

106
00:08:36,255 --> 00:08:39,146
Of course, the money right away, I
leave my brother, look at that.

107
00:08:39,151 --> 00:08:40,307
I don't know, I don't know.

108
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:43,322
In any case you can deal directly
with the notary.

109
00:08:43,447 --> 00:08:46,495
Of course, then, you run the risk that
we remove the discount.

110
00:08:46,496 --> 00:08:48,213
You have a discount? He's a worker.

111
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:50,367
I have a motor car, I carry the star.
Yeah, yeah.

112
00:08:50,645 --> 00:08:52,820
That's what happens to us banks for
trusting,

113
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:54,807
for not doing more investigation.
Yes, yes sir.

114
00:08:54,932 --> 00:08:56,869
A cigar? Thank you very much.

115
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,884
If you'll permit me, I'll keep it for after
dinner.

116
00:08:58,885 --> 00:09:02,444
Speaking of, you give calendars this
year? You know dad always...

117
00:09:02,569 --> 00:09:04,255
We'll send it to him. Don't worry.

118
00:09:04,381 --> 00:09:07,593
Thank you very much, Mr. Rodolfo,
and happy holidays from all my
heart.

119
00:09:07,627 --> 00:09:09,498
Same here, my regards to your dad.

120
00:09:09,499 --> 00:09:12,418
- Mr. Quintanilla I have to fix this
deal.
- Here, Julian, take this.

121
00:09:12,429 --> 00:09:14,755
I told you I have to deliver the
baskets -You, stay here

122
00:09:14,766 --> 00:09:18,120
If not they'll take my note to the
notary, idiot. I'll send over the rest
with Paquito.

123
00:09:18,121 --> 00:09:20,106
We don't have time. - Stay here

124
00:09:20,139 --> 00:09:21,181
Yes, let's go.

125
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:24,438
Smoke?

126
00:09:25,438 --> 00:09:26,885
This one's fresh

127
00:09:28,521 --> 00:09:30,597
I'd make a mess with all those
numbers

128
00:09:30,787 --> 00:09:32,877
Sit down, please.

129
00:09:43,542 --> 00:09:45,165
Think there'll be a nice one?

130
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:47,644
Hey you, over there! Come on, the
sister's calling us.

131
00:09:47,769 --> 00:09:50,268
They should tell us if we'll get dinner.

132
00:09:50,393 --> 00:09:53,361
All we need is for them to send us to
a house with a turkey.

133
00:09:53,486 --> 00:09:56,201
Well, why do I want turkey with these
teeth.

134
00:09:56,491 --> 00:09:58,378
The teeth I had.

135
00:09:59,606 --> 00:10:03,134
The elderly, Mr. Quintanilla, where
do we put the elderly?

136
00:10:03,141 --> 00:10:05,501
The elderly, well I don't know, there
with the other poor.

137
00:10:05,502 --> 00:10:08,284
Yes, let's go, hurry. Let the soldiers
pass.

138
00:10:08,409 --> 00:10:10,380
Come you, fix that coat neck

139
00:10:10,413 --> 00:10:14,048
A candle? You were going to the
funeral. But sister, I went to
yesterday's.

140
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:16,760
Sister, no, we've had to take the
poor from the street.

141
00:10:16,771 --> 00:10:20,002
If you send those from the shelter to
the funeral, families will be left
without poor people.

142
00:10:20,003 --> 00:10:22,707
They can't miss the funeral, it's the
surest entry to the shelter.

143
00:10:22,729 --> 00:10:24,982
You'll understand that with times as
they are.

144
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:26,545
Come over here.

145
00:10:26,779 --> 00:10:28,656
Trickster! Liar!

146
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:31,802
Sister, I wanted to see the actresses.

147
00:10:32,685 --> 00:10:35,737
Let's see the ladies. Where are the
ladies from the charity.

148
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,384
That ski mask? - I got it in the war.

149
00:10:38,401 --> 00:10:41,273
Take it off. You should be in the
carriage setting up the living art.

150
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:42,992
Movement.

151
00:10:43,314 --> 00:10:45,143
It's freezing. And me with my
sinusitis.

152
00:10:45,152 --> 00:10:45,952
Gabino

153
00:10:46,077 --> 00:10:48,492
What? Oh a blanket. Listen where
are the ladies?

154
00:10:48,505 --> 00:10:51,735
Give me your coat, I dying of cold.
Yes, take it my love.

155
00:10:53,658 --> 00:10:55,549
Listen, where's your mom?

156
00:10:55,571 --> 00:11:00,240
In the boss's office. The train must
have derailed, we've been waiting
for an hour.

157
00:11:00,266 --> 00:11:02,599
To the office, let's go to the office.
Cover yourself up.

158
00:11:02,624 --> 00:11:04,318
Listen, it's this way.

159
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:06,644
Some gloves. Get me some gloves.

160
00:11:06,769 --> 00:11:09,255
Listen, tell me if the 412 has left
there.

161
00:11:09,275 --> 00:11:11,225
Ask if it's carrying the actresses from
Madrid.

162
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:13,931
Listen, do you know if the train has
some actors from Madrid?

163
00:11:14,766 --> 00:11:17,909
What kind of actors? Film actors,
they're traveling with a journalist.

164
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:18,977
Film actors.

165
00:11:22,271 --> 00:11:23,522
Later.

166
00:11:24,092 --> 00:11:27,029
Sirs, the train is about to arrive. I'm
going to get ready.

167
00:11:28,047 --> 00:11:29,700
The other door.

168
00:11:30,237 --> 00:11:32,488
I'll tell you something about the
elderly, for sure.

169
00:11:32,489 --> 00:11:34,205
With this cold they must be freezing.

170
00:11:34,207 --> 00:11:35,832
Isn't there some shelter, where we
can put them?

171
00:11:35,836 --> 00:11:37,653
Good afternoon to all. Happy
holidays.

172
00:11:38,112 --> 00:11:41,138
Come in. Could we pay the man with
the motor car?

173
00:11:41,139 --> 00:11:43,397
He's the one who carries the float
with the rich and poor men.

174
00:11:43,398 --> 00:11:45,329
Yes, I've seen you. Very appropriate,
right?

175
00:11:45,363 --> 00:11:47,946
Thank you, but with this cold, so then
we'll pay him?

176
00:11:48,071 --> 00:11:51,620
Oh no, that's something for Mr.
Zapater. Come let's organize things.

177
00:11:51,873 --> 00:11:54,322
Don't forget you need to take this
pot.

178
00:11:54,323 --> 00:11:57,655
Mr. Zapater? No, I'm the director of
the radio station.

179
00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:00,139
Did you see Martita, Gabino, isn't
she beautiful?

180
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:03,527
Yes, yes beautiful, beautiful. I lent
her my coat, she was very cold.

181
00:12:03,562 --> 00:12:05,478
You hold the champagne. What
champagne?

182
00:12:05,483 --> 00:12:07,423
What I want is to get paid. Where's
Zapater?

183
00:12:07,424 --> 00:12:09,010
Here's Rivas, our administrator. Let's
go.

184
00:12:09,011 --> 00:12:10,928
- Can you pay me? - Without
authorization, no.

185
00:12:10,955 --> 00:12:13,767
- I'll tell him, be patient. - He'll tell
him now, be patient.

186
00:12:13,892 --> 00:12:15,844
Let's go. Hurry up.

187
00:12:15,969 --> 00:12:20,124
Come on, I have two kids. If they
impound my motorcar I'm dead.

188
00:12:20,569 --> 00:12:23,572
But what are you, on a day like today
they won't impound anything.

189
00:12:23,577 --> 00:12:24,840
You won't make it son.

190
00:12:24,842 --> 00:12:26,657
We haven't been able to practice the
living picture.

191
00:12:26,664 --> 00:12:29,442
Let's go, the pot. Mr. Zapater has
said it has to be there.

192
00:12:29,448 --> 00:12:30,699
The pot. - Let's go.

193
00:12:30,824 --> 00:12:32,837
I want the transmission...

194
00:12:32,962 --> 00:12:35,627
Let me see, that hat doesn't suit you

195
00:12:35,752 --> 00:12:42,570
Mr. Arturo, do us the favor of lending
us your hat, you'll get it back.

196
00:12:43,697 --> 00:12:45,351
There, that's better.

197
00:12:46,011 --> 00:12:47,348
I'm coming sister.

198
00:12:47,473 --> 00:12:51,042
Mr. Quintanilla the elderly can't stay
here. They're freezing

199
00:12:51,075 --> 00:12:53,605
But the train is arriving any moment
sister.

200
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:57,645
At this age you can't do this, besides
this poor one has rheumatism

201
00:12:57,770 --> 00:12:59,703
Well, with dinner they'll come
around.

202
00:12:59,736 --> 00:13:01,287
We want to be given Cognac.

203
00:13:01,731 --> 00:13:04,158
- Very well, put it up front. - Mr.
Zapeter!

204
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:05,945
- Is the train coming or not? - Yes,
yes

205
00:13:05,959 --> 00:13:08,316
- And the actresses, any news?
- The boss has said that...

206
00:13:08,339 --> 00:13:11,471
Please, pay me now. It's the same to
you and the ladies have authorized
it.

207
00:13:11,472 --> 00:13:14,973
Who is this? - It's the motor car guy,
I don't know what he's saying about
an impound.

208
00:13:19,001 --> 00:13:20,097
It's 400 right?

209
00:13:20,222 --> 00:13:23,518
Yeah but one more thing, I need 120
more, for the balance of the note.

210
00:13:23,643 --> 00:13:27,362
Don't worry, I'll take care of the pots.
But please, give me a solution

211
00:13:27,487 --> 00:13:29,037
It's Christmas

212
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:32,875
The family, understand, it's not a
good time to have impounded your
livelihood.

213
00:13:32,899 --> 00:13:37,560
Give him the 120 Rivas, but you
already know this dinner has been
cooked in Cocinex pots.

214
00:13:37,685 --> 00:13:39,671
Tell everyone. - Of course sir.

215
00:13:40,121 --> 00:13:43,311
Here take this son. Take it to uncle
Julian, he's at the bank at Calle
Mayor

216
00:13:43,436 --> 00:13:44,635
I know Hurry up.

217
00:13:44,669 --> 00:13:46,998
So your issue's been resolved? Yes,
all solved.

218
00:13:47,123 --> 00:13:48,544
Oh those two, don't let them eat the
turkey

219
00:13:48,545 --> 00:13:50,526
The music? - It's in the cantina.

220
00:13:50,527 --> 00:13:53,158
I'm going. Let's go

221
00:13:54,102 --> 00:13:57,958
NO, other way round. Like that.

222
00:13:58,083 --> 00:13:59,197
Let's go.

223
00:14:19,594 --> 00:14:23,933
You have to go with them? Yes, it's
not my decision.

224
00:14:24,058 --> 00:14:25,507
But behave, it's important

225
00:14:27,314 --> 00:14:29,246
Do you know them? - I do.

226
00:14:29,634 --> 00:14:33,526
- They must be some starlets. - It's
true, since they're from the movies.

227
00:14:33,527 --> 00:14:41,112
I can see stars from our. Alexinia,
the singing child, Paquiteo, and
others accompanied by Roberto
Manizar

228
00:14:41,237 --> 00:14:43,641
- Isn't that Carmen Sevilla? - I
believe so.

229
00:14:43,962 --> 00:14:45,528
She must have dyed her hair blonde.

230
00:14:45,653 --> 00:14:47,829
When do we dine? Patience my son.

231
00:14:47,954 --> 00:14:49,896
Why is she winking?

232
00:14:50,021 --> 00:14:51,160
Move aside

233
00:15:05,191 --> 00:15:07,221
Listen, I think he's looking at me.

234
00:15:07,438 --> 00:15:09,170
Don't kid yourself, he's looking at me

235
00:15:09,295 --> 00:15:11,173
Girl, move over ok. Careful

236
00:15:11,419 --> 00:15:14,537
Thank you, thank you.

237
00:15:14,857 --> 00:15:16,031
Hello Olmedo.

238
00:15:16,156 --> 00:15:18,387
- Listen, where are the stars?
- What stars?

239
00:15:18,512 --> 00:15:20,617
The film actresses. Where's Carmen
Sevilla?

240
00:15:20,742 --> 00:15:21,503
She couldn't come.

241
00:15:21,628 --> 00:15:24,747
But what I wanted was to take a
picture of Carmen Sevilla with a
Cocinex pot.

242
00:15:24,772 --> 00:15:26,252
We'll fix it, don't worry

243
00:15:26,377 --> 00:15:30,378
You have to understand that the top
stars won't leave home.

244
00:15:30,397 --> 00:15:31,939
Here comes Ladi, she's my girlfriend.

245
00:15:34,337 --> 00:15:35,491
Move over son.

246
00:15:38,951 --> 00:15:41,633
With stars we all know-yeah of
course but...

247
00:15:41,758 --> 00:15:45,147
They'll do for the auction. The girls
are pretty.

248
00:15:45,272 --> 00:15:48,600
After the parade you'll be able to
retire to rest at the Hotel Europa

249
00:15:48,626 --> 00:15:50,023
And bathe with hot water,

250
00:15:50,148 --> 00:15:54,196
- Make way. Make way please.
- Girls, girls go with the man with the
hat.

251
00:15:54,231 --> 00:15:55,308
They're such children.

252
00:15:55,341 --> 00:15:59,550
Man, we can relax Let's go, let's go

253
00:16:00,075 --> 00:16:02,609
Listen, guard. - Yes ma'am?

254
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:05,710
- Can I give this man a package?
- I'll ask that you give it to his family.

255
00:16:05,711 --> 00:16:09,064
Yes his family. Thank you. Very kind.
Take this, miss. - Thank you.

256
00:16:09,189 --> 00:16:12,024
Poor men, spending these days in
jail.

257
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:29,148
An uncovered car? I'm not going.

258
00:16:29,273 --> 00:16:31,732
I'm not getting on this car with this
bunch

259
00:16:31,857 --> 00:16:33,706
- What's going on? - The charity
insists.

260
00:16:33,832 --> 00:16:35,236
Of course, don't start getting prissy.

261
00:16:35,251 --> 00:16:36,581
This isn't what was in my contract.

262
00:16:36,606 --> 00:16:38,595
Forget the contract and be careful
with the step...

263
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:40,503
The flowers are for me, for me

264
00:16:42,729 --> 00:16:44,664
Listen. Are you the organizer?

265
00:16:44,954 --> 00:16:46,466
Your purse Miss.

266
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:47,763
Don't annoy, man.

267
00:16:47,764 --> 00:16:50,970
Listen, the organizer, really, not
exactly

268
00:16:51,095 --> 00:16:54,395
See, what I'd like to talk about is the
payment.

269
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:57,777
But then yours isn't a free
contribution?

270
00:16:57,778 --> 00:17:01,970
- Really, man, I'm a professional.
- Frankly, I don't know.

271
00:17:02,095 --> 00:17:03,806
Zapater! It's your department.

272
00:17:03,931 --> 00:17:06,308
- The man with the fur will help you
for sure. - Thank you

273
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:09,903
Take our picture, Gabino. Please I
can't my treasure, understand.

274
00:17:10,028 --> 00:17:11,964
Smile, like a queen. - Listen.

275
00:17:11,988 --> 00:17:15,254
- Signs up high, big smile. - The
truck, there's a man who won't get
on.

276
00:17:16,997 --> 00:17:19,055
Tell me sir, what's your issue.

277
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:24,433
I refuse to continue here. This is
below my standards.

278
00:17:24,558 --> 00:17:25,944
Standards, yes sir, yes sir.

279
00:17:26,069 --> 00:17:29,113
I've made 5 trips to America, with
Mrs. Maria, and Morano

280
00:17:29,238 --> 00:17:33,298
And now you want to put me there?
I'm offended. I refuse. I refuse.

281
00:17:33,423 --> 00:17:35,866
Don't worry we'll fix it. For the
moment get on my vehicle.

282
00:17:35,991 --> 00:17:38,492
- Placido, make the man
comfortable. - Here in the side seat.

283
00:17:38,531 --> 00:17:41,282
Everything's going well over here?
You can start eating the turkey.

284
00:17:41,311 --> 00:17:43,477
- Offer the poor man. - There's no
more.

285
00:17:43,602 --> 00:17:47,383
No more, what a disaster. Well
pretend, give him the bones.

286
00:17:47,508 --> 00:17:48,972
And the champagne?

287
00:17:49,097 --> 00:17:51,056
If you want we'll pass by a tavern
and buy wine.

288
00:17:51,088 --> 00:17:55,246
You think we have time for that! No,
no, always problems.

289
00:17:55,269 --> 00:17:56,958
Would you mind going on the other
side?

290
00:17:57,083 --> 00:18:00,914
Me again? Yes on the right. It's
better for the weight.

291
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:02,883
Watch out you'll break it.

292
00:18:03,008 --> 00:18:07,044
Sit down, here. Ready?

293
00:19:12,741 --> 00:19:15,496
Stop, stop. Stop a moment.

294
00:19:15,621 --> 00:19:18,695
Damn, Some respect. You must
have offended the church.

295
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:21,244
We've given them a military salute
Mr. Gabino.

296
00:19:21,369 --> 00:19:25,172
Oh, oh ok. You do it the military way.
I didn't know that.

297
00:19:25,297 --> 00:19:28,533
Well, then now lots of joy. Joy, joy.

298
00:19:29,107 --> 00:19:32,780
Joy, and a little tuning, if possible.

299
00:19:34,518 --> 00:19:37,078
And the driver? - What do I know?

300
00:19:37,496 --> 00:19:40,128
- Do you know how to drive? - Yes,
in the movies.

301
00:19:40,253 --> 00:19:44,317
- Well, go ahead. Go ahead. - I only
know the hands. The feet no.

302
00:19:44,442 --> 00:19:47,278
And besides, I won't tolerate what
you're doing to me.

303
00:19:47,403 --> 00:19:49,004
I'm decorated!

304
00:19:49,129 --> 00:19:51,421
Yes, yes I know. And with much
merit.

305
00:19:51,439 --> 00:19:55,304
- Look, get on with the other actors.
- Leave me alone.

306
00:20:07,352 --> 00:20:10,349
Hey, hey.

307
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:14,338
Mr. Rabaldon, you can relax. I've
paid the bill on motorcar

308
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:17,252
- My god, in this procession?
- Sorry, a relative?

309
00:20:17,377 --> 00:20:21,074
- An acquaintance, someone up in
years. - Well, then my condolences

310
00:20:21,199 --> 00:20:25,111
- Don't forget the next due date. The
24th. - Don't worry. Bye

311
00:20:25,145 --> 00:20:26,544
Let's go. - I'm coming.

312
00:20:26,669 --> 00:20:28,304
It's late. - I'm coming, man.

313
00:20:28,429 --> 00:20:29,959
But what are you doing there?

314
00:20:30,608 --> 00:20:32,420
We've lost the parade.

315
00:20:49,746 --> 00:20:55,203
Even if only for one night. We ask
your generosity.

316
00:20:56,278 --> 00:20:58,705
Like a good Samaritan.

317
00:20:59,186 --> 00:21:01,905
Mr. Depablo Mayor 371st right

318
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:04,782
Juan Torres Martinez Pasaje
Oliveras 19

319
00:21:04,907 --> 00:21:06,022
The parade!

320
00:21:06,023 --> 00:21:08,382
What do you care about the parade?
There's actors from Madrid.

321
00:21:08,401 --> 00:21:10,778
Besides I have to give my brother
the bill from the notary

322
00:21:10,818 --> 00:21:12,663
Listen I'll be right back.

323
00:21:12,788 --> 00:21:16,634
Come here, get back to work. Where
are you going!

324
00:21:21,842 --> 00:21:25,108
- Hey Placido. - Julian! I was waiting
for you.

325
00:21:25,233 --> 00:21:26,350
Give me the note.

326
00:21:26,475 --> 00:21:29,264
That's what I was going to tell you. I
couldn't pay it.

327
00:21:29,389 --> 00:21:32,224
When Paquito arrived they'd already
taken it to the notary.

328
00:21:32,349 --> 00:21:35,061
What did you do? It's not my fault.

329
00:21:35,186 --> 00:21:38,087
Mother of god, but didn't I tell you to
pay attention.

330
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:40,158
We're falling behind. - What a pain

331
00:21:40,171 --> 00:21:42,586
Well give me the money, fool, you're
not good for anything.

332
00:21:42,599 --> 00:21:44,944
- I had to deliver the baskets. - I
have to do everything.

333
00:21:44,969 --> 00:21:47,778
- What's going on? - What had to
happen, and all because of you

334
00:21:47,779 --> 00:21:49,518
The note, they took it to the notary.

335
00:21:49,519 --> 00:21:51,580
Listen the actors have come. Start
delivering.

336
00:21:51,613 --> 00:21:52,743
Leave me alone.

337
00:21:52,868 --> 00:21:55,392
Hey, you. Can you return my 40
bucks?

338
00:21:55,517 --> 00:21:58,571
- Where are you going? - I'm going
to the notary, he lives right there

339
00:21:58,606 --> 00:22:00,814
- You can't do that, you'll ruin the
parade. - Please!

340
00:22:00,815 --> 00:22:03,047
You've been paid and have a duty.
I'll report you to the police.

341
00:22:03,072 --> 00:22:05,644
- Help me, do something. - Fine,
don't get like that.

342
00:22:05,645 --> 00:22:08,251
Listen, on a day like today
everyone's willing to do a favor.

343
00:22:08,252 --> 00:22:09,793
Yeah, that's what you said at the
station.

344
00:22:09,818 --> 00:22:12,145
Surely the notary will be at the
casino for the auction

345
00:22:12,178 --> 00:22:15,677
Get back in the parade, we've ended
up at the back again...

346
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:19,130
Over there, enthusiasm, lots of
enthusiasm.

347
00:22:22,955 --> 00:22:26,048
That for one night we all be human
beings.

348
00:22:26,173 --> 00:22:30,095
That for one night the black hearted
be generous.

349
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:32,759
That for one night the poor will dine.

350
00:22:34,986 --> 00:22:36,170
What's that?

351
00:22:36,295 --> 00:22:37,473
That's for the poor.

352
00:22:37,598 --> 00:22:40,301
- When's dad coming back. - Shut
up, I'll slap you.

353
00:22:56,665 --> 00:22:58,522
Here comes the motorcar

354
00:22:58,746 --> 00:23:01,462
Dad. Grandpa's here.

355
00:23:03,705 --> 00:23:04,914
Emilia.

356
00:23:06,269 --> 00:23:08,751
- What's wrong? - Great spot you've
put us in.

357
00:23:08,876 --> 00:23:11,295
Come soon. I have to make dinner.

358
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:13,731
Emilia, is that kid yours?

359
00:23:13,856 --> 00:23:16,635
We'll see. I'm not sure yet.

360
00:23:17,395 --> 00:23:19,263
Well, let's go in.

361
00:23:20,034 --> 00:23:21,556
What have you brought father.

362
00:23:21,681 --> 00:23:25,581
Oil, cheese and some buns.

363
00:23:25,706 --> 00:23:28,912
Aren't we going home? I want to
leave all this.

364
00:23:29,037 --> 00:23:30,713
No, we'll wait here for Placido.

365
00:23:30,838 --> 00:23:33,724
That way he'll take us in the car and
save us the walk.

366
00:23:33,849 --> 00:23:35,813
That's true your home's at the end of
the world.

367
00:23:35,938 --> 00:23:38,960
3000 going once 3000 going twice

368
00:23:39,743 --> 00:23:44,038
3200! 3200 going once

369
00:23:44,163 --> 00:23:47,216
- Listen, a man has asked for a
close up -Which man?

370
00:23:47,341 --> 00:23:48,592
That one with the white hair

371
00:23:48,597 --> 00:23:51,078
Tell him to wait, without Alternating
current I can't do anything

372
00:23:51,103 --> 00:23:57,216
Sold for 3200. The sirs Swai can pick
up this beautiful star

373
00:23:57,341 --> 00:24:00,865
She'll brighten your dinner with her
radiant presence.

374
00:24:05,561 --> 00:24:07,015
Careful

375
00:24:08,782 --> 00:24:10,706
A pleasure. - A pleasure.

376
00:24:10,831 --> 00:24:14,689
While the notary, Mr. Gil, takes down
the first sale of the night, the queen

377
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:15,868
The queen?

378
00:24:17,088 --> 00:24:18,147
Where's Martita?

379
00:24:18,148 --> 00:24:20,265
I don't know. I think Gabino went to
get her.

380
00:24:20,266 --> 00:24:21,619
Bring The queen.

381
00:24:21,744 --> 00:24:24,956
We have to find the queen. She's
the one who has to present the
Cocinex pots.

382
00:24:24,989 --> 00:24:26,800
Madam, where's your daughter?

383
00:24:26,926 --> 00:24:30,355
The queen, is she a short girl, kind of
ugly?

384
00:24:30,356 --> 00:24:32,898
- What are you saying? - Well, she
left with a young man.

385
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:34,619
That's impossible.

386
00:24:34,626 --> 00:24:36,909
Go find the queen at once. Look for
her everywhere.

387
00:24:36,914 --> 00:24:38,879
Mr. Quintanilla already went. It
doesn't matter.

388
00:24:38,903 --> 00:24:41,802
He's out there going round like a
madman -Hold this, I'll go find her.
- Exactly.

389
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:43,835
She's the one who has to hand out
the pots.

390
00:24:44,238 --> 00:24:47,846
Are you from the parade? A taxi, I
need a taxi.

391
00:24:47,847 --> 00:24:50,405
Now's no the time to find a taxi. Stop
bothering.

392
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:53,743
Next we're going to auction Paquita
del Toro

393
00:24:53,868 --> 00:24:56,783
Paquita del Toro, eh Paquita del
Toro

394
00:24:56,908 --> 00:25:00,630
The dancer, embodies the qualities
of the Spanish temperament

395
00:25:01,066 --> 00:25:04,525
- Listen, that money's for us right. - I
doubt it.

396
00:25:04,536 --> 00:25:06,991
- Of course it's for us. - And when
do we get it?

397
00:25:07,002 --> 00:25:08,837
They insist it's for the charity.

398
00:25:08,838 --> 00:25:11,531
Oh no, I have to bring back a
present for my mom.

399
00:25:26,938 --> 00:25:28,816
Well, upstairs there's no one either.

400
00:25:30,104 --> 00:25:32,740
- She must have had to go out to the
street. - The coat's not here.

401
00:25:32,765 --> 00:25:35,365
Come, Mr. Gabino, She must have
gone back to the ballroom.

402
00:25:35,388 --> 00:25:38,704
We have to fix my problem. You
promised me you'd talk with the
notary.

403
00:25:38,707 --> 00:25:40,803
Leave me alone. What's important is
finding Martita

404
00:25:40,815 --> 00:25:44,176
Remember what the banker told us,
about the sunset Look, it's getting
dark.

405
00:25:44,725 --> 00:25:46,037
Martita!

406
00:25:47,876 --> 00:25:51,109
- Why have they boarded up the
barber shop. - The barber shop?
What do I know.

407
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:54,088
What a disaster. Everyone in the
ballroom except her.

408
00:25:54,089 --> 00:25:57,625
Come, don't take it like that, man.
Maybe she's forgotten something at
home

409
00:25:57,626 --> 00:26:00,465
I would have gone myself Martita

410
00:26:00,743 --> 00:26:02,864
Come, we have to talk to the notary.

411
00:26:02,891 --> 00:26:04,859
Something must have happened.
Martita

412
00:26:09,596 --> 00:26:11,274
What's wrong now.

413
00:26:13,366 --> 00:26:15,947
And in that movie I played a great
romantic.

414
00:26:15,972 --> 00:26:20,119
Yes, a romantic, that's what I am.
Always looking for the ideal

415
00:26:20,616 --> 00:26:23,148
No one knows how the artist suffers
in this search.

416
00:26:23,273 --> 00:26:27,340
Now, in this little city I've found the
female ideal.

417
00:26:27,465 --> 00:26:28,565
But, Martita!

418
00:26:29,835 --> 00:26:30,877
Cover up

419
00:26:32,453 --> 00:26:33,940
Can we know what you're doing here

420
00:26:34,065 --> 00:26:37,203
You see, her pants ripped when she
got on the car

421
00:26:37,204 --> 00:26:40,414
You, the queen of the party, leave
the ballroom without any respect for
the audience

422
00:26:40,437 --> 00:26:40,895
Take this

423
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:44,492
You have no shame. Seduced by
that idiot.

424
00:26:44,525 --> 00:26:47,689
- Gabino, don't think badly -You,
shut up, you're at fault.

425
00:26:48,645 --> 00:26:51,683
- I'm going to tell your mom. - He's
going to tell her mom

426
00:26:51,691 --> 00:26:54,311
Ideal, you're a simple woman, that's
what you are.

427
00:26:55,613 --> 00:26:57,788
No, Gabino, don't get angry.

428
00:26:57,789 --> 00:27:00,095
I assure you there were no bad
intentions.

429
00:27:00,096 --> 00:27:04,161
Yeah, and why did it have to be you,
specifically you, who sewed the
pants?

430
00:27:04,286 --> 00:27:05,734
Because Fonsanta doesn't know.

431
00:27:05,859 --> 00:27:07,940
Come on, forget this, it's not
important.

432
00:27:08,065 --> 00:27:10,678
Let's go, let's go -It's over it's over.

433
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:12,529
Thank you little miss you've been
very kind.

434
00:27:12,844 --> 00:27:13,967
It's nothing, man.

435
00:27:14,092 --> 00:27:16,550
Let's go, calm down. Don't worry.

436
00:27:17,701 --> 00:27:20,118
Why does this man get involved in
what doesn't concern him?

437
00:27:20,229 --> 00:27:21,847
He's Martita's boyfriend.

438
00:27:22,216 --> 00:27:23,637
I have no boyfriend.

439
00:27:23,762 --> 00:27:26,802
This country's so uncivilized. Out
there everything's different.

440
00:27:26,927 --> 00:27:31,781
I've worked in Italy. I've worked a lot.
And in that country women...

441
00:27:32,284 --> 00:27:35,873
Final opportunity of the night. The
brightest rising star of our cinema

442
00:27:35,998 --> 00:27:37,549
Maruja Collar

443
00:27:39,008 --> 00:27:42,247
Let's see, let's see Excuse me kid

444
00:27:42,372 --> 00:27:45,040
Let's see, Marujita, what was your
last movie?

445
00:27:45,041 --> 00:27:47,127
Rome in Flames.

446
00:27:47,252 --> 00:27:49,549
A pity, we haven't seen it here yet.
And your first?

447
00:27:50,046 --> 00:27:51,088
Rome in Flames

448
00:27:51,144 --> 00:27:53,543
And what was your role in that
magnificent production?

449
00:27:53,856 --> 00:27:55,333
I played a Christian martyr

450
00:27:55,458 --> 00:27:56,965
And did the lions devour you?

451
00:27:57,090 --> 00:27:59,381
I don't know. My agent didn't tell me
anything.

452
00:27:59,382 --> 00:28:00,939
Auction her and stop with this
silliness.

453
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:04,061
For the finale we offer a sensational
auction,

454
00:28:04,186 --> 00:28:07,419
Maruja Collar and the singing child
Paquito Yepez, in a single lot.

455
00:28:07,432 --> 00:28:09,534
Come gentlemen, don't be afraid.

456
00:28:09,948 --> 00:28:16,793
Ahh, the beautiful queen of the ball,
will present a Cocinex pot from Mr.
Zapater

457
00:28:21,709 --> 00:28:23,085
Mr. Quintanilla

458
00:28:24,024 --> 00:28:26,584
- What's going on? - Talk to the
notary.

459
00:28:26,592 --> 00:28:28,330
Man, he's recording the auction.

460
00:28:28,338 --> 00:28:31,971
- He'll slip out of our hands. - I tell
you no -I'm telling you he will

461
00:28:33,095 --> 00:28:35,180
Mr. Gil, Mr. Gil

462
00:28:36,266 --> 00:28:38,395
Could you spare just a second.

463
00:28:44,008 --> 00:28:47,242
- You see, right now he's working.
- Yes, I'm left without my motorcar

464
00:28:47,367 --> 00:28:53,447
An auction, come on gentleman
courage, a lot just like you deserve.
Courage

465
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:55,629
1000 pesetas 1000 pesetas

466
00:28:55,754 --> 00:28:58,134
15002000

467
00:28:58,259 --> 00:29:00,253
2500-A moment -3000

468
00:29:00,378 --> 00:29:05,862
We must announce, as we expect
your generosity, that the child comes
with it's mother.

469
00:29:05,987 --> 00:29:07,808
Do I sing now? Shut it.

470
00:29:08,338 --> 00:29:10,293
We'll start the auction over.

471
00:29:10,805 --> 00:29:11,702
300 pesetas

472
00:29:11,827 --> 00:29:15,995
We ask the respectable public, that
laughable sums

473
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:21,281
will be ignored, since I'm sure it's just
a joke in bad taste.

474
00:29:21,406 --> 00:29:24,299
Hey, it's no joke. It's half my salary

475
00:29:24,424 --> 00:29:28,472
Continue the auction Offers
gentlemen. Come on push.

476
00:29:28,597 --> 00:29:30,154
1000 pesetas

477
00:29:31,816 --> 00:29:34,069
A moment, me or you?

478
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:34,887
You

479
00:29:35,012 --> 00:29:39,283
2000-2000 once, 2000 twice,

480
00:29:39,408 --> 00:29:41,558
2500-2800

481
00:29:43,662 --> 00:29:46,205
3500 from the man in the gray jacket

482
00:29:47,368 --> 00:29:51,997
4000, we have an offer of 4000
pesetas to dine with this marvelous
star of our cinema

483
00:29:52,122 --> 00:29:53,164
Idiot

484
00:29:53,196 --> 00:29:55,990
Woman, we have to look good, the
boss is watching.

485
00:29:56,024 --> 00:29:57,447
You'll see how you'll get it.

486
00:29:57,448 --> 00:29:59,648
Don't worry, they'll offer more.

487
00:29:59,683 --> 00:30:04,593
4000 once, 4000 twice

488
00:30:04,884 --> 00:30:07,913
4000 thrice

489
00:30:08,038 --> 00:30:10,928
Applause to the man who's won this
lot

490
00:30:11,053 --> 00:30:13,611
There you go. Weren't they going to
offer more?

491
00:30:13,736 --> 00:30:14,575
Let's see how we pay

492
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:17,236
I've still got my bonus, I'll give it to
them.

493
00:30:36,431 --> 00:30:39,181
With this sale, Damian Olmedo says
goodbye

494
00:30:39,306 --> 00:30:41,417
until the transmission of the dinner.

495
00:30:41,542 --> 00:30:43,765
We ask those present to pick up
their respective poor

496
00:30:43,766 --> 00:30:45,969
to share with them their Christmas
dinner.

497
00:30:46,095 --> 00:30:48,427
Ladies and Gentlemen, the auction
has come to an end.

498
00:30:48,552 --> 00:30:50,246
Happy holidays, and thank you.

499
00:30:52,432 --> 00:30:55,260
I haven't been auctioned, and I'm a
lead actor.

500
00:30:55,385 --> 00:30:57,286
That's something for Mr. Zapater.

501
00:30:57,411 --> 00:31:00,605
A moment, Mr. Gil. Just a moment.

502
00:31:00,606 --> 00:31:03,959
I don't know if you remember me. I'm
Quintanilla's son, the butcher

503
00:31:03,977 --> 00:31:06,048
Martita's boyfriend. - Ahh, yes

504
00:31:06,049 --> 00:31:07,786
I'd like to ask you a favor, this man

505
00:31:07,787 --> 00:31:09,266
Placido Alonso, at your service,

506
00:31:09,267 --> 00:31:11,910
This man has a bank note, and so
he's gone to the bank

507
00:31:11,912 --> 00:31:13,634
and they told him that they gave it to
you

508
00:31:13,645 --> 00:31:15,853
I haven't been able to go, I had to be
in the parade.

509
00:31:15,854 --> 00:31:19,085
You see, he has the money to pay it.
If you would do him a favor.

510
00:31:19,086 --> 00:31:21,196
Be magnanimous, he's a worker

511
00:31:21,197 --> 00:31:23,855
But I don't know anything about it.
That's something my intern does.

512
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,879
If the note hasn't been paid on time

513
00:31:25,882 --> 00:31:28,699
the official will have gone to the
debtor's home before sunset

514
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,204
He'll have noted it and,

515
00:31:30,205 --> 00:31:32,059
Let's hope that's what he's done.

516
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:33,812
You see, and all because of you.

517
00:31:33,813 --> 00:31:35,798
He should pass by the office and
solve the problem.

518
00:31:35,799 --> 00:31:38,562
That's it. You see. Many thanks.

519
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:40,769
- When you're ready. - Happy
holidays

520
00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:42,767
Cheers to your father. - I'll tell him.

521
00:31:42,807 --> 00:31:43,292
Gabino

522
00:31:43,417 --> 00:31:47,991
Take the microphone, we're going to
the De Galan house and you'll go
the notary's office.

523
00:31:48,116 --> 00:31:49,648
Well, where do I dine?

524
00:31:49,773 --> 00:31:52,483
Look, go there with the poor, and
some family will take you.

525
00:31:52,608 --> 00:31:53,195
With those?

526
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:56,110
And if not I'll give you ten bucks and
you can dine down the street.

527
00:31:56,135 --> 00:31:58,463
I, who's dined in the best hotels in
the world

528
00:31:58,588 --> 00:32:02,769
Well dine where you want, but
remember that Cocinex is with you.

529
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:06,387
- You've found your poor man?
- Yes sir.

530
00:32:08,444 --> 00:32:10,796
So we were going to dine with
Carmen Sevilla, eh?

531
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:12,210
Do you sing?

532
00:32:12,211 --> 00:32:14,133
If I don't sing I won't eat?

533
00:32:14,137 --> 00:32:15,501
Of course you will.

534
00:32:15,626 --> 00:32:16,689
But of course.

535
00:32:16,814 --> 00:32:18,601
Let's go, you'd drown in a glass of
water.

536
00:32:18,602 --> 00:32:22,347
If only the notes from our shop all
came due on Christmas Eve.

537
00:32:22,473 --> 00:32:24,806
- On a day like this, they won't seize
anything. - Ok

538
00:32:25,282 --> 00:32:26,806
Where are you going.

539
00:32:26,807 --> 00:32:30,601
- To find a young lady who'll sew my
pants. - Gabino.

540
00:32:30,726 --> 00:32:32,301
We too are taking an actress.

541
00:32:32,302 --> 00:32:34,533
As president of the charity I was
obliged

542
00:32:34,534 --> 00:32:36,547
Although to me, these film people...

543
00:32:36,549 --> 00:32:38,057
You what did you get?

544
00:32:38,066 --> 00:32:39,480
Elderly from the home or poor from
the street?

545
00:32:39,481 --> 00:32:41,335
Those from the street are downstairs

546
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:42,427
I don't know, I don't know

547
00:32:42,442 --> 00:32:45,502
I'd prefer and old person, old people
are more helpless

548
00:32:45,503 --> 00:32:47,485
Besides, as you know, I lost my
father and

549
00:32:47,486 --> 00:32:49,928
with an old person we'll remember
him more.

550
00:32:50,053 --> 00:32:52,105
Hello, Rosario -How are you?

551
00:32:52,106 --> 00:32:54,410
My poor man's named Ricardo
Guerra

552
00:32:54,411 --> 00:32:56,201
How lovely -Happy holidays

553
00:32:56,202 --> 00:32:57,962
Edmundo, are we ready?

554
00:32:57,963 --> 00:33:00,802
Yes, yes whenever you want.

555
00:33:00,927 --> 00:33:02,250
My ticket. - Where do you work?

556
00:33:02,375 --> 00:33:04,829
At the Cine Rica, but my name is
Carmela

557
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:06,329
Let's go find our poor man.

558
00:33:06,330 --> 00:33:07,739
Oh what excitement.

559
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:09,873
You could have chosen a less
scandalous one.

560
00:33:09,874 --> 00:33:11,143
Yes, but there wasn't one.

561
00:33:11,553 --> 00:33:15,198
Martita, let's go. You've given
enough to talk about already.

562
00:33:15,323 --> 00:33:17,493
Cheer up, bear with it, at home

563
00:33:18,376 --> 00:33:20,112
I don't want any of those.

564
00:33:20,113 --> 00:33:24,127
- Woman, it's the one we drew
- That one looks a little tidier.

565
00:33:24,132 --> 00:33:25,303
Get him, quickly.

566
00:33:26,173 --> 00:33:27,787
Did you come for the transmission?

567
00:33:27,788 --> 00:33:30,781
No, Ma'am, Olmedo's ready
Goodbye

568
00:33:31,067 --> 00:33:33,140
Let's go good man. Do you like
turkey?

569
00:33:33,141 --> 00:33:34,373
Yes Ma'am, I like it a lot

570
00:33:36,936 --> 00:33:37,851
Fonsanta

571
00:33:37,976 --> 00:33:39,567
Martita, Where's Gabino?

572
00:33:39,692 --> 00:33:41,836
He went home to prepare the
transmission.

573
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:43,869
So, how did it go?

574
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:46,863
I managed to get him to come dine
at home. Girl, what luck.

575
00:33:46,988 --> 00:33:49,223
- And how did you do it? - Because
of the pants.

576
00:33:49,247 --> 00:33:51,084
What joy, I'll call you later.

577
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:01,682
For sure, this makes such a strange
sound.

578
00:34:02,456 --> 00:34:03,847
Couldn't it be the cables?

579
00:34:03,972 --> 00:34:05,958
It'd be horrible if we had a short
circuit.

580
00:34:05,959 --> 00:34:09,054
Well, this outlet needs to be free for
the direct transmission,

581
00:34:09,058 --> 00:34:10,552
which is what I care about.

582
00:34:10,563 --> 00:34:12,071
- Mr. Gabino. - You guys do what
you can.

583
00:34:12,078 --> 00:34:14,808
Let me go home This you can do on
your own.

584
00:34:14,829 --> 00:34:17,933
What a pain you are. Didn't we get
everything sorted out with the
notary?

585
00:34:17,934 --> 00:34:20,955
Yes, but until I get the note in my
pocket I can't relax.

586
00:34:20,957 --> 00:34:23,039
Mr. Gabino, these men say...

587
00:34:23,164 --> 00:34:25,047
Good evening, we're from the local
press

588
00:34:25,172 --> 00:34:28,718
A pleasure, sit down please The
gentlemen will be here soon.

589
00:34:28,843 --> 00:34:30,841
- The centerpiece goes where?
- Here, and here.

590
00:34:30,842 --> 00:34:34,587
The lady asked that we first serve
the poor man, and then the actress

591
00:34:34,884 --> 00:34:36,602
These cables make me nervous.

592
00:34:36,727 --> 00:34:38,367
Won't I get shocked when I serve the
soup?

593
00:34:38,368 --> 00:34:41,275
Don't worry, and if something
happens I'm here to lend a hand.

594
00:34:41,276 --> 00:34:43,355
Olmedo, please

595
00:34:43,402 --> 00:34:45,115
Mr. Gabino, I have nothing to do
here.

596
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:47,103
They're here, they're here, take the
microphone,

597
00:34:47,111 --> 00:34:50,362
she wants the whole tape plug it in
there. - Good evening.

598
00:34:50,487 --> 00:34:52,499
Oh, what a beautiful house you have

599
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,761
No, humble, very humble.

600
00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:57,388
Aren't you cold?

601
00:34:57,389 --> 00:34:59,788
No, it's much colder in a studio.

602
00:34:59,913 --> 00:35:01,858
Where it was cold was on the street,

603
00:35:01,859 --> 00:35:03,243
The parade left me frozen

604
00:35:03,244 --> 00:35:04,581
Is the appetizer ready?

605
00:35:05,183 --> 00:35:06,934
- Where do I sit sir? - There, right
there.

606
00:35:07,021 --> 00:35:08,510
You can drink anything, anything.

607
00:35:08,511 --> 00:35:10,884
Well, it's getting late, I have to start
the transmission.

608
00:35:10,909 --> 00:35:12,066
Let's see the mayonnaise.

609
00:35:12,191 --> 00:35:14,379
Talk, some laughter.

610
00:35:15,316 --> 00:35:17,334
Come Turn it on. Turn it on

611
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:19,413
Ladies and gentlemen, a very good
evening.

612
00:35:19,414 --> 00:35:22,184
We find ourselves in the welcoming
house of the de Galn family.

613
00:35:22,185 --> 00:35:26,672
Mrs. de Galen, as you know, is the
president of the Ladies charity

614
00:35:26,673 --> 00:35:31,680
who has organized this campaign of
marvelous humanity, of magnificent
charity, of deep significance

615
00:35:32,217 --> 00:35:37,081
This dinner, that will unite poor and
rich in homes all over our city

616
00:35:37,449 --> 00:35:40,819
Mr. Gabino, please, my family is
waiting for me in the toilets.

617
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:42,641
No! Don't say that it'll get on air.

618
00:35:42,642 --> 00:35:45,661
And now the poor man served gently
by the film star

619
00:35:45,667 --> 00:35:46,983
will begin his appetizer

620
00:35:46,984 --> 00:35:50,824
while the men from the press take
his happy picture

621
00:35:50,949 --> 00:35:52,115
Eat, it's shrimp

622
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,718
Toads no, I don't like it.

623
00:35:53,843 --> 00:35:55,959
We'll interview this old man,
disowned by lady luck

624
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:59,435
that he tell us, in the name of his
comrades how they feel in these
moments

625
00:35:59,651 --> 00:36:00,693
Please.

626
00:36:00,719 --> 00:36:02,282
No, not me, no.

627
00:36:02,407 --> 00:36:05,189
Enchanting, your modesty, but
please don't be afraid and tell us

628
00:36:05,191 --> 00:36:06,271
Are you happy?

629
00:36:06,761 --> 00:36:08,674
I, well, one can't know.

630
00:36:08,727 --> 00:36:10,525
Naturally, he's overjoyed

631
00:36:10,526 --> 00:36:12,904
And tell me, what's your opinion of
this initiative

632
00:36:12,905 --> 00:36:15,744
which has made it possible for you,
and so many like you

633
00:36:15,745 --> 00:36:18,633
share dinner with these generous
families.

634
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:21,829
Say you're very moved

635
00:36:21,954 --> 00:36:24,812
Well, I, what the young lady here
said

636
00:36:24,813 --> 00:36:31,551
Truly a moving picture, which all of
you are witnessing in your homes

637
00:36:32,145 --> 00:36:35,335
And now let's pass from serene old
age to splendid youth

638
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:38,084
We will interview a genteel young
lady

639
00:36:38,085 --> 00:36:40,407
Kind, lovely, beautiful,

640
00:36:40,408 --> 00:36:44,709
who has come to us to lift this
campaign with her presence

641
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:46,447
Mr. Quintanilla I'm going

642
00:36:46,448 --> 00:36:47,797
How many movies have you made?

643
00:36:47,798 --> 00:36:49,140
I'm going to the notary Come here

644
00:36:49,141 --> 00:36:50,828
No, no You can't do this

645
00:36:50,885 --> 00:36:54,237
I'm going to the notary Don't leave
me alone with this cable

646
00:36:54,362 --> 00:36:55,652
BW, Color or Technicolor?

647
00:36:55,777 --> 00:36:57,423
Color and Cinemascope

648
00:36:58,498 --> 00:37:03,605
Jimenez, Pedro 7037

649
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:05,616
This one doesn't have things in order

650
00:37:05,741 --> 00:37:07,703
Doesn't matter you write it down

651
00:37:07,828 --> 00:37:09,515
There are things I just don't
understand

652
00:37:09,516 --> 00:37:11,684
Couldn't we do this the day after
tomorrow?

653
00:37:11,685 --> 00:37:12,820
Go on, go on.

654
00:37:12,946 --> 00:37:14,523
Number 64

655
00:37:14,648 --> 00:37:20,405
Levante-Ferrer, Isaias 94342

656
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:22,168
This isn't fair, man

657
00:37:22,293 --> 00:37:25,172
One should go home be with the
family

658
00:37:25,173 --> 00:37:27,838
Besides the poor man will be there

659
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:31,109
Damn the time when they thought up
this idiocy.

660
00:37:31,235 --> 00:37:33,007
He'll hear you. - Let him hear me.

661
00:37:33,132 --> 00:37:35,135
I've been meaning to speak my mind

662
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:38,326
Why are we obliged to take a poor
man.

663
00:37:38,451 --> 00:37:39,436
We weren't forced.

664
00:37:39,444 --> 00:37:41,824
How weren't we forced, of course we
were forced.

665
00:37:41,949 --> 00:37:43,429
Evening -Evening

666
00:37:43,554 --> 00:37:45,540
I'm here to pay a banknote

667
00:37:45,665 --> 00:37:47,978
We're closed for that, come back
day after tomorrow.

668
00:37:47,979 --> 00:37:51,397
No, I know, but I've talked to the
notary,

669
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:54,416
this afternoon at the Casino, during
the auction

670
00:37:54,417 --> 00:37:56,937
And he told me that although the sun
has set I could...

671
00:37:56,944 --> 00:37:57,648
Your Name?

672
00:37:57,773 --> 00:37:59,746
Placido, Placido Alonso, at your
service,

673
00:37:59,747 --> 00:38:01,147
From Alonso Transport

674
00:38:01,272 --> 00:38:02,737
And I had the money, you know

675
00:38:02,738 --> 00:38:05,023
But with this whole charity thing,
coming and going

676
00:38:05,148 --> 00:38:07,002
- What name did you say? - Placido
Alonso

677
00:38:07,014 --> 00:38:08,973
It's the first payment on my motorcar,
you know.

678
00:38:09,097 --> 00:38:10,512
I like to be serious

679
00:38:10,513 --> 00:38:15,584
Imagine how I am, that if I don't pay
this today, my Christmas Eve is
ruined

680
00:38:15,709 --> 00:38:18,608
Look, it's 6820, here it is

681
00:38:18,609 --> 00:38:20,097
Plus the expenses

682
00:38:20,222 --> 00:38:21,529
Expenses?

683
00:38:21,654 --> 00:38:24,072
But here no one's had any expenses

684
00:38:24,527 --> 00:38:27,033
You don't understand, the legal fees

685
00:38:27,463 --> 00:38:30,283
- You've never had a bank note?
- No.

686
00:38:30,408 --> 00:38:35,487
I, on a day like today, Mr. Quintanilla
told me, told me

687
00:38:35,612 --> 00:38:37,581
Well, how much is it altogether?

688
00:38:37,706 --> 00:38:40,638
6820 from the note,

689
00:38:40,763 --> 00:38:41,805
plus

690
00:38:44,932 --> 00:38:49,871
143.50 from the act, your copy and
the trip to the outskirts

691
00:38:50,608 --> 00:38:56,421
Makes a total of 6963.50

692
00:38:56,546 --> 00:38:59,364
And all because of that irresponsible
Quintanilla

693
00:38:59,489 --> 00:39:01,780
Saying on a day like this they won't
impound anything

694
00:39:01,781 --> 00:39:03,406
That's what I get for trusting

695
00:39:03,531 --> 00:39:05,013
What a mess

696
00:39:06,436 --> 00:39:07,325
Nothing.

697
00:39:07,450 --> 00:39:09,451
I have no choice but to pay those
expenses?

698
00:39:09,576 --> 00:39:11,468
Well, do you have the money or not?

699
00:39:11,593 --> 00:39:12,684
Well, no, no sir.

700
00:39:12,809 --> 00:39:14,205
Come, let's do our thing.

701
00:39:14,330 --> 00:39:15,744
Let's finish this for once.

702
00:39:15,869 --> 00:39:19,646
Wait, I'll go get the money and come
back right away.

703
00:39:19,771 --> 00:39:21,648
I want to pay it, I'm a serious person.

704
00:39:21,649 --> 00:39:23,332
I need to be relaxed for Christmas
Eve

705
00:39:23,347 --> 00:39:26,140
Sure you're coming back right away?
Yes sir, in a moment. Thank you.

706
00:39:26,169 --> 00:39:28,260
Listen, first pick up your things

707
00:39:28,261 --> 00:39:30,036
No need, my motorcar is downstairs

708
00:39:30,161 --> 00:39:32,244
It doesn't matter, pick them up. Yes
thank you

709
00:39:32,245 --> 00:39:33,936
You'll wait for me, right.

710
00:39:34,061 --> 00:39:34,588
Come on.

711
00:39:34,713 --> 00:39:36,470
It's just a moment a quick moment

712
00:39:39,013 --> 00:39:40,374
Levante-Ferrer Oh, done

713
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:44,244
Lopez Riquelme, Cristino Number

714
00:39:44,369 --> 00:39:47,058
watch out, this one is a dependent

715
00:39:47,183 --> 00:39:48,299
Come with me

716
00:39:48,424 --> 00:39:49,685
So, how's it going.

717
00:39:49,686 --> 00:39:52,240
Good, we're just finishing up

718
00:39:52,365 --> 00:39:54,443
Good, leave it. Don't worry.

719
00:39:54,445 --> 00:39:56,669
Tonight you have to go home early.

720
00:39:57,661 --> 00:40:00,303
But first you'll have a drink with me,
naturally.

721
00:40:00,428 --> 00:40:02,838
We have to honor my guest.

722
00:40:02,839 --> 00:40:04,724
Come, come to the dining room

723
00:40:05,532 --> 00:40:08,388
- What do you want? A bit of
Sherry? - Thank you, thank you.

724
00:40:08,513 --> 00:40:12,052
A drink, better would be if he gave
us a pair of bottles.

725
00:40:12,177 --> 00:40:13,076
Will you shut up.

726
00:40:13,092 --> 00:40:16,569
But, why won't he let us go home?

727
00:40:16,571 --> 00:40:20,064
What do I care about this poor man
campaign.

728
00:40:20,189 --> 00:40:22,279
Really, but why don't you retire.

729
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:25,199
You have the butcher shop, you
children are grown

730
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:28,344
Why get worked up? You'll get an
ulcer

731
00:40:28,469 --> 00:40:30,734
Besides, leave me alone. Tell it to
him.

732
00:40:32,032 --> 00:40:32,892
May we come in?

733
00:40:33,017 --> 00:40:35,285
Come in, come in and have a drink

734
00:40:35,332 --> 00:40:38,306
Here you have our man Look at him

735
00:40:38,565 --> 00:40:41,740
A drink? - Thank you.

736
00:40:42,973 --> 00:40:44,614
This night is Christmas Eve

737
00:40:44,615 --> 00:40:46,018
Take down the nativity? - Yes

738
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:49,465
This night is Christmas Eve And
tomorrow Christmas Day

739
00:40:51,022 --> 00:40:52,648
Stop shouting

740
00:40:55,996 --> 00:40:58,262
Mom, dad's here. It was about time.

741
00:40:58,387 --> 00:41:01,110
Come, I still have to make dinner

742
00:41:01,235 --> 00:41:02,780
Here, here take the baby

743
00:41:02,781 --> 00:41:04,372
A moment, let me put on my coat.

744
00:41:04,667 --> 00:41:06,333
She's wet -Ok

745
00:41:06,458 --> 00:41:07,141
Emilia

746
00:41:07,266 --> 00:41:08,830
- What a disaster -What
happened?

747
00:41:08,839 --> 00:41:11,314
The banknote, I have to pay the
expenses, I have to go to the notary.

748
00:41:11,334 --> 00:41:14,519
Hey grandpa, I need 20 bucks, lend
them to me, eh.

749
00:41:14,524 --> 00:41:18,309
- I'll get them back to you day after
tomorrow -I don't have anything.
You're always asking.

750
00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:20,345
You're the ones who should be
giving to me.

751
00:41:20,347 --> 00:41:22,561
Emilia, you ask him. I have to pay
the note.

752
00:41:22,686 --> 00:41:25,256
- Give them to him, father -Father,
father.

753
00:41:25,257 --> 00:41:29,079
I bring you oil, cheese and biscuits
and now you ask for money

754
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:32,149
I don't have it. I brought just what I
need for the ticket home.

755
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:33,634
Don't lie, you brought money.

756
00:41:33,638 --> 00:41:36,209
Every time he comes from the
village, he brings money to buy
things.

757
00:41:36,210 --> 00:41:37,187
Lend them to me, grandpa

758
00:41:37,188 --> 00:41:39,886
I said no, you guys don't know how it
is in the country.

759
00:41:39,887 --> 00:41:41,889
This year everything went badly.

760
00:41:42,311 --> 00:41:46,812
Look, look -Let's see. No more?

761
00:41:46,937 --> 00:41:48,481
Mother of god.

762
00:41:49,701 --> 00:41:50,743
And you, Julian

763
00:41:50,848 --> 00:41:52,532
Yeah, you already got mine.

764
00:41:52,657 --> 00:41:54,241
And what they gave you for the
baskets?

765
00:41:54,335 --> 00:41:58,431
The baskets, that scoundrel told me
I'd get more than him from the tips

766
00:41:58,556 --> 00:42:01,612
Well, show me the tips. That's what
he said and look,

767
00:42:01,737 --> 00:42:03,644
13.50, if that helps.

768
00:42:04,330 --> 00:42:05,833
It's not enough

769
00:42:06,155 --> 00:42:07,378
Hey, and that?

770
00:42:07,503 --> 00:42:08,861
Some guy didn't want it.

771
00:42:08,986 --> 00:42:11,189
Come, with this we'll get the 20
bucks.

772
00:42:11,314 --> 00:42:14,338
No, this one's for us. We're going to
turn purple.

773
00:42:14,463 --> 00:42:15,895
Don't worry, we won't lose it.

774
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:17,401
It's best if they don't see it.

775
00:42:17,526 --> 00:42:19,027
He told me to throw it out, but...

776
00:42:19,152 --> 00:42:20,780
You'll see how it brings us bad luck

777
00:42:20,905 --> 00:42:24,565
No, it was someone who said he
didn't accept anything. Too dignified.

778
00:42:24,690 --> 00:42:27,551
Let's go quickly. The basket's got the
answer.

779
00:42:27,554 --> 00:42:28,692
They're going to see it.

780
00:42:28,697 --> 00:42:29,715
Come, leave the nativity.

781
00:42:29,716 --> 00:42:31,463
Nothing'll happen

782
00:42:32,135 --> 00:42:34,433
Careful, we're in the middle of the
road.

783
00:42:34,434 --> 00:42:36,847
Careful, you're going to bring us
trouble.

784
00:42:36,848 --> 00:42:39,201
Placido, you're going to bring us
trouble and ruin

785
00:42:39,326 --> 00:42:41,375
Calm down. Look, we leave it as a
guarantee

786
00:42:41,376 --> 00:42:43,168
As soon as I pay the note they give it
back.

787
00:42:43,273 --> 00:42:45,962
- No, then they'll keep it for a party.
- Don't be foolish.

788
00:42:45,963 --> 00:42:47,005
Why would they keep it?

789
00:42:47,098 --> 00:42:48,752
Mr. Quintanilla's a good friend.

790
00:42:48,877 --> 00:42:50,827
Besides, there's the notary too.

791
00:42:50,828 --> 00:42:52,863
Ok cover it up well Don't let them
see it.

792
00:42:53,559 --> 00:42:55,404
Cover yourself up, father, it's very
cold.

793
00:42:55,529 --> 00:42:57,194
Put on your scarf, Paquito.

794
00:42:57,857 --> 00:42:58,899
My God.

795
00:43:00,758 --> 00:43:01,915
Hey, give the girl.

796
00:43:02,165 --> 00:43:03,691
Up we go grandpa

797
00:43:03,816 --> 00:43:06,045
If I manage it I'll stay home.

798
00:43:06,170 --> 00:43:07,212
We're going.

799
00:43:11,832 --> 00:43:14,541
WELCOME PILGRIMS CHARITY

800
00:43:33,632 --> 00:43:36,529
In this magnificent dining hall with
handcrafted ceilings

801
00:43:36,537 --> 00:43:39,787
Sumptuous lamps, brilliant mirrors

802
00:43:39,912 --> 00:43:42,372
and, and beautiful paintings

803
00:43:42,498 --> 00:43:45,415
Is finishing one of the dishes

804
00:43:46,470 --> 00:43:48,027
of the magnificent dinner

805
00:43:48,152 --> 00:43:50,084
The old man served with care

806
00:43:51,304 --> 00:43:54,158
truly well by the star of the cinema

807
00:43:54,181 --> 00:43:55,565
Drinks a glass of wine

808
00:43:55,690 --> 00:43:58,328
The conversation, brilliant and
animated

809
00:43:58,453 --> 00:44:02,145
Reigns in this house like in the rest
of the homes of the city

810
00:44:02,406 --> 00:44:05,600
The hosts go out of their way to
attend to their guests

811
00:44:07,226 --> 00:44:08,665
Please, talk.

812
00:44:08,790 --> 00:44:11,547
And you? You must be very old

813
00:44:11,672 --> 00:44:13,072
Very, girl, very

814
00:44:13,197 --> 00:44:15,716
In October of next year, 79

815
00:44:15,841 --> 00:44:18,477
Joy, Joy. - So witty you are

816
00:44:18,602 --> 00:44:20,448
But you keep yourself well, you know

817
00:44:20,573 --> 00:44:23,345
Don't believe it. It's just appearances

818
00:44:23,564 --> 00:44:27,169
I have a pain all over The sisters say
I don't but

819
00:44:27,294 --> 00:44:28,555
I think it's cancer

820
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:32,912
Marvelous, the serenity of this old
man

821
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:35,918
Who now makes a toast to his hosts.

822
00:44:36,043 --> 00:44:37,717
So yeah, I'm not well at all

823
00:44:37,842 --> 00:44:40,528
Like another said they'll never take
the fun I've had

824
00:44:40,653 --> 00:44:42,739
You should have known me during
the war.

825
00:44:42,864 --> 00:44:44,941
The African one? - No WWI

826
00:44:45,066 --> 00:44:47,385
No, no. I must speak personally with
Mr. Gabino

827
00:44:47,441 --> 00:44:50,654
This man has to speak with Mr.
Gabino, where have they gone?

828
00:44:50,655 --> 00:44:53,301
They called on the phone. A poor
man has fallen ill.

829
00:44:53,302 --> 00:44:56,684
It had to happen, we caught cold at
the station and the parade

830
00:44:56,688 --> 00:44:58,787
Please, do you know where they
went? It's urgent.

831
00:44:58,788 --> 00:45:02,439
In half an hour, after a break beyond
our control

832
00:45:02,442 --> 00:45:07,260
We'll connect with our studio so you
may listen to a collection of
Christmas carols

833
00:45:07,463 --> 00:45:10,928
- Happy holidays to all -Where'd
they go, where'd they go!

834
00:45:10,967 --> 00:45:13,751
The Higuera house, the hardware
store, at Plaza San Paz

835
00:45:14,122 --> 00:45:17,870
Say do you if Mr. Gabino went as
well? Yes, they all went.

836
00:45:17,871 --> 00:45:20,319
Thanks. Goodbye. What a mess,
what a mess.

837
00:45:20,444 --> 00:45:23,083
- Well, and what do I do? - Well
keep dining.

838
00:45:23,208 --> 00:45:25,952
And when dinner's over, where do I
find the others?

839
00:45:25,953 --> 00:45:32,303
I'll escort you, my pleasure. This
night more than one will get sick with
that cold we caught.

840
00:45:35,623 --> 00:45:36,726
What is it?

841
00:45:36,851 --> 00:45:39,127
Nothing. I can't find a pulse.

842
00:45:39,252 --> 00:45:42,122
My god, sacred mother, turn off that
radio

843
00:45:42,247 --> 00:45:44,350
Antonia, Antonia!

844
00:45:44,475 --> 00:45:46,204
No, no. It must be mine.

845
00:45:46,215 --> 00:45:48,463
- Child will you stop reading comics.
- Leave the children

846
00:45:48,464 --> 00:45:49,479
How's it going?

847
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:51,912
Don't ask. Take them away, This isn't
for them

848
00:45:51,913 --> 00:45:53,368
You've eaten enough

849
00:45:53,493 --> 00:45:56,292
Come, Come. Let's go.

850
00:45:56,496 --> 00:45:58,833
But, finally, is the doctor coming or
not?

851
00:45:58,834 --> 00:46:01,454
Yes, his wife says when he arrives
they'll send him over.

852
00:46:01,579 --> 00:46:04,347
I'm going to call the dentist. He'll
know something.

853
00:46:04,472 --> 00:46:06,797
Antonia Antonia

854
00:46:07,543 --> 00:46:09,545
Go get the dentist, downstairs.

855
00:46:09,670 --> 00:46:11,802
Don Poni? Yes Don Poni.

856
00:46:11,927 --> 00:46:14,519
If you'd listened to me

857
00:46:14,807 --> 00:46:18,268
We had to take a poor man, get it
through your head.

858
00:46:18,393 --> 00:46:20,020
You tell him, Alvaro

859
00:46:20,145 --> 00:46:21,187
He's crazy.

860
00:46:21,615 --> 00:46:27,809
Just what we needed. Being like you
are, where everyone knows how you
think, we hadn't taken a poor man.

861
00:46:27,934 --> 00:46:31,242
That's true. In these small towns
people talk a lot.

862
00:46:31,367 --> 00:46:35,649
Naturally dad. What I don't
understand is how yours is the one
who got sick.

863
00:46:36,013 --> 00:46:38,829
So, that De Galan lady, when's she
coming?

864
00:46:38,852 --> 00:46:41,481
They should be here soon One
thing, by god

865
00:46:41,514 --> 00:46:44,313
Treat her with respect -Leave me in
peace

866
00:46:44,438 --> 00:46:48,099
You've ruined my dinner. Besides I'm
in my home and I'll do what I want

867
00:46:48,224 --> 00:46:51,580
And now I'll turn the radio on
Because this sick man isn't even
family

868
00:46:51,705 --> 00:46:54,970
Mom, I say that if Mrs. De Galan
comes we should put the poor man
in a bed.

869
00:46:55,003 --> 00:46:57,607
You're right, we'll put him in Antonia's

870
00:46:57,733 --> 00:46:59,457
You think we can move him?

871
00:46:59,582 --> 00:47:02,112
Meh, doesn't have a pulse Have you
tried the other hand?

872
00:47:02,113 --> 00:47:03,925
Jesus, Mary and Joseph

873
00:47:03,926 --> 00:47:06,101
No, No it's useless There's nothing
to do

874
00:47:06,226 --> 00:47:10,805
Antonia! Prepare your bed. We're
going to lay down the poor man.

875
00:47:10,930 --> 00:47:14,136
In my bed? No Ma'am. Who knows
what he has!

876
00:47:14,261 --> 00:47:17,113
Maybe it's something contagious,
and one's very wary

877
00:47:17,238 --> 00:47:21,363
Mom, if De Galan comes and sees
her in the maids room it'll look bad

878
00:47:21,386 --> 00:47:23,772
You're right. We'll have to take him
to ours.

879
00:47:23,897 --> 00:47:27,711
Get clean sheets. The stitched ones.

880
00:47:27,836 --> 00:47:30,551
No better the lace ones. De Galan's
coming.

881
00:47:30,676 --> 00:47:33,574
And you, Alvaro, help bring the poor
man.

882
00:47:33,625 --> 00:47:34,860
Come, Come

883
00:47:35,409 --> 00:47:38,608
And you, Matias, put on you jacket
and tie.

884
00:47:38,733 --> 00:47:41,592
Me, can't one be in one's house as
one likes?

885
00:47:41,602 --> 00:47:43,596
Antonia, lend a hand.

886
00:47:46,315 --> 00:47:50,211
What a pain you are. To have to
take him to our room.

887
00:47:53,030 --> 00:47:55,401
Put on your bonnet, we have visitors.

888
00:47:55,402 --> 00:47:57,906
The bonnet? No ma'am I just got my
hair done.

889
00:47:57,907 --> 00:47:59,574
Don't talk back. Put on the bonnet.

890
00:48:00,047 --> 00:48:02,059
Lie the poor man down.

891
00:48:02,184 --> 00:48:07,003
And give him cologne, the mosquito
one. I'll go get Don Poni

892
00:48:07,041 --> 00:48:11,169
My God, what a tragedy. What a
tragedy!

893
00:48:11,483 --> 00:48:13,671
Oh what cold.

894
00:48:13,796 --> 00:48:17,101
Josefa, Josefa! You called Maria?

895
00:48:17,226 --> 00:48:21,800
By God, tell your brother to come up.
Our poor man has decided to die.

896
00:48:21,801 --> 00:48:25,868
My God! Sorry, but imagine the
inconvenience this is for us.

897
00:48:25,871 --> 00:48:28,426
- Don't worry, I'll tell him now.
- Thank you.

898
00:48:28,461 --> 00:48:29,503
No problem.

899
00:48:32,518 --> 00:48:35,051
Be still you. Be still.
You'll eat in a bit.

900
00:48:35,177 --> 00:48:37,472
What's going on? - Go up.

901
00:48:37,473 --> 00:48:39,549
The Helguera's poor man has fallen
ill.

902
00:48:40,446 --> 00:48:43,036
Here, as you see, he's very jealous.

903
00:48:43,037 --> 00:48:45,141
He won't let guest be served first.

904
00:48:45,266 --> 00:48:48,911
- But, your sisters don't eat? - No, I
have them on a strict diet

905
00:48:49,036 --> 00:48:53,691
Look, he doesn't have teeth, in
effect, so what I tried was

906
00:48:53,692 --> 00:48:56,999
to make him a prosthetic, but it
wasn't possible. And now I'll...

907
00:48:57,002 --> 00:48:59,333
Come, they're waiting for you
upstairs.

908
00:48:59,334 --> 00:49:01,411
- The poor man's the one upstairs?
- Yes

909
00:49:01,536 --> 00:49:05,463
Of course, Pascual, he's a neighbor
of mine.

910
00:49:05,588 --> 00:49:07,776
He has angina, they given him...

911
00:49:07,901 --> 00:49:11,113
Oh angina, let's see Vivian, where's
my lab coat and steth...

912
00:49:11,114 --> 00:49:15,332
- Must be in the closet, dear, get it.
- Better be the clean one, eh.

913
00:49:15,457 --> 00:49:17,206
Hurry up

914
00:49:20,318 --> 00:49:23,776
This is the downside of the
profession. People have no tact.

915
00:49:23,777 --> 00:49:26,334
On a night like this, bothering us on
a whim.

916
00:49:26,459 --> 00:49:28,153
What a life, my brother's.

917
00:49:28,278 --> 00:49:31,346
Don't get angry you, he'll be back
soon, poor animal.

918
00:49:31,471 --> 00:49:35,907
We can't leave his side. Calm, Tupi,
calm.

919
00:49:36,032 --> 00:49:37,860
Don't you like dogs?

920
00:49:38,734 --> 00:49:42,256
So your brother's going up to see
Pascual? - Yes

921
00:49:42,381 --> 00:49:45,036
- But, isn't he a dentist?
- Odontologist.

922
00:49:45,162 --> 00:49:46,907
- Oh, odontologist. - Come Vivian,
please.

923
00:49:47,032 --> 00:49:50,071
Will you do up the coat? Yes sir.

924
00:49:50,779 --> 00:49:55,031
Odontologist, my dear friend, is a
medical specialist, a great specialist.

925
00:49:55,156 --> 00:49:57,002
Want to accompany me?

926
00:49:57,127 --> 00:49:59,934
Yes, he should go, so they see we
have a poor man.

927
00:50:00,059 --> 00:50:02,735
Well, I, I don't want to bother

928
00:50:02,736 --> 00:50:05,480
Ah don't worry, they're good people.
I visit them often.

929
00:50:05,481 --> 00:50:08,759
Goodbye Tupi, the boss is leaving to
cure a sick man. - Let's go

930
00:50:08,884 --> 00:50:11,535
And he'll be back to give you a treat.

931
00:50:11,660 --> 00:50:15,789
- Will you accompany me please?
- Don't be long, Poli, we're very put
out.

932
00:50:15,790 --> 00:50:19,489
- Back soon -Put on a coat, dear,
it's very cold.

933
00:50:23,901 --> 00:50:26,608
Come on, you, eat.

934
00:50:26,733 --> 00:50:28,333
Come. Eat some.

935
00:50:28,458 --> 00:50:30,449
Come, it's Christmas eve.

936
00:50:30,574 --> 00:50:32,804
Wait, I'll turn it on.

937
00:50:35,218 --> 00:50:38,403
- What's going on tonight? - They
must be from the charity.

938
00:50:38,528 --> 00:50:40,321
It must be because of Pascual.

939
00:50:40,446 --> 00:50:42,934
The Helguera's live here, do you
know? - Yes, Yes

940
00:50:43,059 --> 00:50:44,898
Thank you very much. Good night.

941
00:50:46,201 --> 00:50:47,879
I-I think it's the 1st right

942
00:50:47,888 --> 00:50:50,742
- The stairs kill me. - It's the first
floor, woman.

943
00:50:50,743 --> 00:50:53,195
Martita, my love, you should have
stayed home.

944
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:55,705
What a cold, and all for not wearing
a shirt.

945
00:50:55,706 --> 00:50:57,262
Girl, how do you know that?

946
00:50:57,387 --> 00:50:59,542
No shirt and no coat, which you've
had all afternoon.

947
00:50:59,543 --> 00:51:02,091
Of course others have no pants.
- Will you shut up.

948
00:51:02,092 --> 00:51:04,194
Ok, enough. These Helguera are
from the casino?

949
00:51:04,195 --> 00:51:05,552
I don't know them. - I do.

950
00:51:05,677 --> 00:51:08,762
- I know, they're from the circle.
- Ah, Republicans

951
00:51:08,887 --> 00:51:10,423
Ay, Gabino

952
00:51:10,548 --> 00:51:13,628
- Martita! come here. - I'll turn it on,
here.

953
00:51:16,541 --> 00:51:19,709
- I think it's this one. - I've been
requested as an expert.

954
00:51:19,712 --> 00:51:21,669
Girl, you should have stayed home.

955
00:51:21,909 --> 00:51:25,171
- Father, will we be in time? - I'm
sure it's angina.

956
00:51:25,296 --> 00:51:27,994
- Again, how impatient. - Let them
wait.

957
00:51:28,119 --> 00:51:32,141
It's all untidy. - Hurry up Matias, go.

958
00:51:32,529 --> 00:51:34,604
- Antonia! - What do you want
ma'am.

959
00:51:34,606 --> 00:51:36,242
Gah, I can't even read the
thermometer.

960
00:51:36,245 --> 00:51:39,343
Girl, what a mess you are, you can't
even put on a bonnet.

961
00:51:39,351 --> 00:51:40,759
Go, Go open it.

962
00:51:41,995 --> 00:51:44,953
- Does he have a temperature?
- Temperature's normal.

963
00:51:44,954 --> 00:51:45,996
Well, his face isn't.

964
00:51:46,423 --> 00:51:47,679
Move, move!

965
00:51:47,804 --> 00:51:51,161
Not even in your own home will they
let you do what you want.

966
00:51:51,684 --> 00:51:53,134
The Helgueras? - Yes, Yes

967
00:51:53,143 --> 00:51:55,280
Already here, and I'm not ready.

968
00:51:55,288 --> 00:51:56,714
My God, my God.

969
00:51:56,721 --> 00:51:58,017
We're the De Galans.

970
00:51:58,870 --> 00:52:00,535
How many people are coming?

971
00:52:00,660 --> 00:52:02,545
- Is the sick man here? - Yes, here
he is.

972
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:04,690
- Where have these people have
put the poor man?

973
00:52:04,691 --> 00:52:06,520
- They must have put him in bed
- Let's see.

974
00:52:06,970 --> 00:52:10,367
- Go ahead, go ahead. - Yes, a
moment, I'll warn them

975
00:52:10,368 --> 00:52:12,403
At least it's not cold here.

976
00:52:12,528 --> 00:52:16,004
- Martita, dear, are you hungry?
- No mom.

977
00:52:16,284 --> 00:52:19,824
- How strange that Olmedo isn't on.
- Yes, very strange.

978
00:52:19,825 --> 00:52:22,061
- He'll be out soon. - Well, I have to
make a call.

979
00:52:22,186 --> 00:52:25,164
- Where's the
- Look there it is -Ahh, I see.

980
00:52:27,795 --> 00:52:30,318
Good evening, Mrs. Encarna

981
00:52:30,319 --> 00:52:32,949
- Sorry we were delayed, we went to
pick up the priest. Is he in time?

982
00:52:32,953 --> 00:52:35,631
Yes, I believe so. Go ahead, Father.

983
00:52:35,682 --> 00:52:37,554
And you too, Don Poli.

984
00:52:37,558 --> 00:52:39,386
Go in, go in. This way Father.

985
00:52:39,394 --> 00:52:41,874
What horror, on a night like this.

986
00:52:42,097 --> 00:52:45,462
Do you know each other? My
husband, son-in-law

987
00:52:45,587 --> 00:52:50,202
The De Galan's. - Mrs. Encarna is
the president of the charity

988
00:52:50,203 --> 00:52:55,052
My Son-in-law is a property
assessor, they've come for the
holidays

989
00:52:55,053 --> 00:52:57,425
- Very good. - Gabino Quintanilla,
how are you?

990
00:52:57,426 --> 00:53:00,386
He's my girl's fianc Dear come here.

991
00:53:00,388 --> 00:53:01,349
Yes mom

992
00:53:01,350 --> 00:53:03,058
And this man is with you?

993
00:53:03,060 --> 00:53:04,912
No he was with the doctor. - Ah

994
00:53:04,913 --> 00:53:07,531
Then he can go to the kitchen
- Listen, listen

995
00:53:07,656 --> 00:53:10,078
Come, come with me. They'll give
you soup.

996
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:12,675
Mrs. Helguera, her son-in-law, my
daughter Martita

997
00:53:12,676 --> 00:53:13,934
Charmed -A pleasure.

998
00:53:13,935 --> 00:53:18,134
- Could we see the sick man? - Of
course, go ahead.

999
00:53:18,259 --> 00:53:21,620
- But it makes me a bit uneasy. - I
told you not to come.

1000
00:53:21,621 --> 00:53:25,578
- Right now he's free of fever. - A
good sign, let's see.

1001
00:53:26,288 --> 00:53:28,278
Yup, I, on the other hand, between
my sinusitis

1002
00:53:28,279 --> 00:53:32,338
and the responsibility of this
campaign -Oh my, try it, try it.

1003
00:53:32,978 --> 00:53:36,823
- But please go ahead. - No, you
first -No I insist

1004
00:53:38,075 --> 00:53:40,854
Why isn't he in bed? We're making
it. Maruja, help me.

1005
00:53:40,855 --> 00:53:43,353
Don't worry, that's a vaccine. Your
stomach?

1006
00:53:45,397 --> 00:53:46,736
Let's see.

1007
00:53:48,323 --> 00:53:49,735
Hold him still

1008
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:53,181
What bad luck, the campaign is a
success, and now.

1009
00:53:53,307 --> 00:53:55,856
- How is he doctor? - Boil this,
please.

1010
00:53:56,533 --> 00:53:57,907
Cardiac arrest. eh?

1011
00:53:57,908 --> 00:54:00,603
Angina, and it's not the first.

1012
00:54:00,728 --> 00:54:03,750
Miss Maria, Miss Maria, Excuse me
Father

1013
00:54:03,875 --> 00:54:07,123
- Miss Maria, boil the needle -Yes,
yes, right away.

1014
00:54:07,248 --> 00:54:08,981
Right away. Antonia!

1015
00:54:08,982 --> 00:54:12,050
Boil it well, I'll do it intravenously
but I don't have much hope.

1016
00:54:12,051 --> 00:54:14,351
I think we should leave the priest
alone with the sick man.

1017
00:54:14,352 --> 00:54:17,278
Yes, you're right. Come Mrs.
Encarna Antonia

1018
00:54:17,279 --> 00:54:19,738
- Boil that quickly. - My God, on a
night like this

1019
00:54:19,739 --> 00:54:21,241
And everything had gone so well.

1020
00:54:21,246 --> 00:54:24,498
You have to overcome adversity. Of
Course, of course.

1021
00:54:24,499 --> 00:54:28,626
Take this. - Make sure she disinfects
it. You, to the kitchen.

1022
00:54:28,627 --> 00:54:31,565
- My grandsons, twins. - So
handsome

1023
00:54:31,566 --> 00:54:34,791
I'm thinking, the poor man was so
happy

1024
00:54:34,917 --> 00:54:37,603
And suddenly, He looked like he'd
fainted

1025
00:54:37,728 --> 00:54:40,691
Right Alvaro? - Yes, suddenly he
looked dead.

1026
00:54:40,816 --> 00:54:43,190
If there's no solution then we should
take him home.

1027
00:54:43,191 --> 00:54:45,201
- Naturally -Of course -That's what
I say

1028
00:54:45,202 --> 00:54:48,375
Sit down. Excuse the mess, but you'll
understand that...

1029
00:54:48,376 --> 00:54:50,400
- Don't worry. - Yeah, there's a sick
man.

1030
00:54:50,410 --> 00:54:52,531
Do you want a drink? You're
welcome to

1031
00:54:52,656 --> 00:54:55,910
You're dinner was also ruined.
- Thank, thank you

1032
00:54:55,911 --> 00:54:59,429
Matias, bring some glasses. It must
be the doctor.

1033
00:54:59,763 --> 00:55:03,097
We called two, we want to do
everything possible

1034
00:55:03,098 --> 00:55:04,856
This one doesn't inspire confidence.

1035
00:55:04,857 --> 00:55:07,043
- Gabino, the dandruff. - The
dandruff

1036
00:55:07,044 --> 00:55:11,318
A glass of Anis? - Yes Cognac
makes me cough.

1037
00:55:11,319 --> 00:55:15,033
- Please do you have Anis? - Yes, a
there's a nice Anis.

1038
00:55:15,034 --> 00:55:16,914
You want some too?

1039
00:55:16,965 --> 00:55:20,337
- Sir, there's a man with a Christmas
basket. - At this hour?

1040
00:55:20,338 --> 00:55:24,389
But Placido, please, you shouldn't
have. How kind.

1041
00:55:24,514 --> 00:55:27,154
- No man, no. - The notary's a real
friend of mine.

1042
00:55:27,279 --> 00:55:31,066
No man, no. I still haven't resolved
my issue with the notary.

1043
00:55:31,191 --> 00:55:33,232
I bring you the basket as collateral.

1044
00:55:33,233 --> 00:55:34,897
- Collateral? - Yes, man, the
expenses.

1045
00:55:34,898 --> 00:55:36,759
Leave it. - The note, has expenses

1046
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:39,206
I need 20 bucks Lend them to me,
man, lend them to me.

1047
00:55:39,207 --> 00:55:40,640
You keep it as collateral, eh

1048
00:55:40,645 --> 00:55:44,424
You're always a nuisance, I can't, I
can't help you. Don't you see.

1049
00:55:44,549 --> 00:55:46,136
How is it, doctor?

1050
00:55:46,261 --> 00:55:48,037
Well, this is over

1051
00:55:48,038 --> 00:55:51,892
Jesus, oh my God. We have to do
something, tell the shelter.

1052
00:55:51,899 --> 00:55:56,155
My God, what a pain for the nuns
Listen, Pascual's not from the
shelter.

1053
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:57,811
You're his family?

1054
00:55:57,937 --> 00:56:00,485
No, I'm
- A neighbor.

1055
00:56:00,610 --> 00:56:02,028
Pascual lives with his Concheta.

1056
00:56:02,029 --> 00:56:05,590
Ah, he's married. We have to notify
his wife. That's the first thing.

1057
00:56:05,809 --> 00:56:08,962
You'll see, married, married, what
you call married

1058
00:56:09,087 --> 00:56:10,676
At this point it's the same.

1059
00:56:10,993 --> 00:56:15,422
You see, Pascual and Concheta are,
well, together.

1060
00:56:15,667 --> 00:56:18,285
In other words, as man and wife.
Damn.

1061
00:56:18,410 --> 00:56:21,552
They live in concubinage. Jesus,
Mother Mary

1062
00:56:21,678 --> 00:56:24,301
Gabino, we have to bring that
woman here, and marry them

1063
00:56:24,302 --> 00:56:26,070
Yeah, but where do these people
live?

1064
00:56:26,071 --> 00:56:28,465
No, Concheta's also part of this
campaign.

1065
00:56:28,590 --> 00:56:31,304
Well then she's on the list.
Everything's here.

1066
00:56:31,305 --> 00:56:33,021
Let's see, Concheta, Concheta.

1067
00:56:34,673 --> 00:56:37,094
Leave me. Concheta, well Concha,
Concha

1068
00:56:37,095 --> 00:56:40,064
There she is. - Ah, here.

1069
00:56:40,189 --> 00:56:44,182
Here, with Mariluz Martin Quickly,
quickly, they're living in sin.

1070
00:56:44,307 --> 00:56:47,163
Don Gabino please, don't let me
down. It's 20 bucks, just 20.

1071
00:56:47,164 --> 00:56:49,280
The motorcar's downstairs? Yes sir,
with my family.

1072
00:56:49,281 --> 00:56:50,809
Take this Gabino -20 bucks.

1073
00:56:50,810 --> 00:56:53,718
- Hurry up. - We'll talk. Please is the
door open?

1074
00:56:53,719 --> 00:56:57,317
- Matias go open the door. - 20
bucks -You'll get them, you'll get
them

1075
00:56:57,442 --> 00:57:01,875
- My God, how these people live.
- What a disaster. Anyway.

1076
00:57:01,878 --> 00:57:05,280
- Listen, I'm going to inject him Can
someone help me? - Do you want
us to say a prayer?

1077
00:57:05,281 --> 00:57:10,250
- Good idea, will you take it? - No,
no way. - No you Mrs. Maria. - No
no.

1078
00:57:12,163 --> 00:57:17,801
- Antonia, Antonia -Not now, pray
girl, pray -The rosary!

1079
00:57:18,449 --> 00:57:21,016
Keep still, this is no time to play.

1080
00:57:21,017 --> 00:57:24,088
What are you doing boy, you'll
release the break and give us more
problems.

1081
00:57:24,093 --> 00:57:25,586
I'm not doing anything

1082
00:57:27,275 --> 00:57:28,318
They're here.

1083
00:57:29,559 --> 00:57:30,923
About time, man.

1084
00:57:32,696 --> 00:57:35,545
Thank you, wait for us, please.

1085
00:57:35,554 --> 00:57:39,773
No, call Sereno, it's freezing. Don't
you see that then I won't arrive in
time.

1086
00:57:39,774 --> 00:57:42,965
How annoying, how annoying you
are. First we'll go to that woman's
house.

1087
00:57:42,966 --> 00:57:45,957
Then I'll give you the money, without
taking the basket

1088
00:57:45,958 --> 00:57:49,055
You pay your note, and you go have
dinner with yours.

1089
00:57:49,056 --> 00:57:51,116
Fine, and what do I do now with the
family.

1090
00:57:53,247 --> 00:57:55,646
- Let them wait upstairs. - Hare
Julian. Out everybody.

1091
00:57:55,661 --> 00:57:58,612
No, calm, calm. Mr. Matias, please

1092
00:57:58,737 --> 00:58:01,775
Could the people go up to your
house. Unfortunates, while we go?

1093
00:58:01,779 --> 00:58:03,873
Well, I, naturally. - Thank you.

1094
00:58:03,998 --> 00:58:07,031
There, it's resolved. I have to do
everything.

1095
00:58:07,039 --> 00:58:09,432
- What's going on now. - I'll be back
soon. - Yeah so you said.

1096
00:58:09,433 --> 00:58:13,107
Here everything is a mess Can't
even dine.

1097
00:58:13,108 --> 00:58:17,506
- Come on. - Another year here. For
this I won't leave the village.

1098
00:58:17,507 --> 00:58:19,777
Upstairs quickly. Paquito, be good.

1099
00:58:19,902 --> 00:58:24,416
Placido please, we won't be in time.
There's a man on his death bed.

1100
00:58:24,429 --> 00:58:28,204
My coat! Forget it.

1101
00:58:28,205 --> 00:58:32,265
- Going up for it? - No, no. The
dying one's me, with my sinusitis

1102
00:58:32,390 --> 00:58:34,508
Where is it? - Eberia 38

1103
00:58:49,614 --> 00:58:52,584
Look how the fish drink in the river.

1104
00:58:52,709 --> 00:58:54,395
What a pain!

1105
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:56,052
How strange men are.

1106
00:58:56,177 --> 00:58:58,391
In the end they always do the same
thing.

1107
00:58:58,613 --> 00:59:03,067
Look, such a cute garter And I have
to wear this garbage.

1108
00:59:03,086 --> 00:59:06,459
And I'm so pretty, without needing
any tricks.

1109
00:59:07,659 --> 00:59:09,757
What a shame the 70 bucks.

1110
00:59:09,882 --> 00:59:12,096
You like it? It's a gift for you.

1111
00:59:12,221 --> 00:59:14,462
- Thank you miss? - For the good it'll
do me.

1112
00:59:14,587 --> 00:59:16,972
And this is just a gift. I'll give you
something else later.

1113
00:59:16,980 --> 00:59:18,963
No don't take this. It's very good

1114
00:59:20,743 --> 00:59:22,253
I'm going Chatito.

1115
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:25,103
- I was getting ready. - Don't be
stupid. A kiss.

1116
00:59:25,472 --> 00:59:28,954
I'll get something from Ramiro for
you in a bit.

1117
00:59:28,955 --> 00:59:30,647
Thank you miss.

1118
00:59:31,741 --> 00:59:34,272
No, I can't Marilu, I can't stand her.

1119
00:59:34,273 --> 00:59:35,758
Come Ramiro, don't be like that.

1120
00:59:35,994 --> 00:59:38,012
The poor woman is behaving
wonderfully.

1121
00:59:38,137 --> 00:59:41,625
Yeah, but I have no freedom.
Besides you never know what can
happen.

1122
00:59:41,961 --> 00:59:46,133
You don't understand I've had to
move mountains to be here with you
tonight.

1123
00:59:47,063 --> 00:59:50,256
Then I come, and I find that horror
there.

1124
00:59:50,381 --> 00:59:51,787
If you'd sent a note.

1125
00:59:51,912 --> 00:59:55,911
- Leave it, I'll clean it later. - No, I
don't want you to ruin your hands.

1126
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:58,794
A kiss A kiss on the little hands.

1127
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:01,973
I tell you, until the last minute I wasn't
sure I could come.

1128
01:00:02,257 --> 01:00:05,080
- Why did you bring her, Marilu?
- One has to be charitable.

1129
01:00:05,793 --> 01:00:08,565
A moment. We'll soon bring the
champagne.

1130
01:00:09,011 --> 01:00:10,118
Yes, yes

1131
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:16,984
Every time I think that I, some day,
could see myself like that, I get...

1132
01:00:17,110 --> 01:00:18,611
I get the urge to cry.

1133
01:00:18,736 --> 01:00:21,473
No don't cry my dear. That'll never
happen to you.

1134
01:00:21,915 --> 01:00:25,382
That's what I'm here for. That's why
your Ramiro's here.

1135
01:00:25,692 --> 01:00:28,095
Listen, did you put it on? - Yes

1136
01:00:29,313 --> 01:00:31,775
Imagine what a good time we would
have had alone.

1137
01:00:31,785 --> 01:00:34,101
Ugh, don't you have a heart?

1138
01:00:34,226 --> 01:00:37,984
I, you know it more than anyone I
have a need to do good things.

1139
01:00:37,985 --> 01:00:40,281
Come, dry your hands and let's go.

1140
01:00:41,530 --> 01:00:44,298
Why don't you serve her desert in
the dining room while we stay here

1141
01:00:44,299 --> 01:00:45,508
Don't be a nag, Ramiro.

1142
01:00:45,512 --> 01:00:47,271
The poor woman will leave soon.

1143
01:00:47,272 --> 01:00:49,409
Oh and one thing, try to be happy.

1144
01:00:49,416 --> 01:00:51,167
Don't put on that sour face.

1145
01:00:52,651 --> 01:00:54,100
Well, we're here.

1146
01:00:54,225 --> 01:00:55,789
How was dinner?

1147
01:00:55,790 --> 01:00:57,326
You like marron glac?

1148
01:00:57,327 --> 01:01:00,382
But miss why did you bother
Anything would have...

1149
01:01:00,383 --> 01:01:02,952
- But it's no bother. Right Ramiro.
- Ah, no.

1150
01:01:03,077 --> 01:01:05,909
Go, put on your coat. And
champagne, you like champagne?

1151
01:01:05,910 --> 01:01:08,913
I think so, but you it must be so
expensive.

1152
01:01:08,914 --> 01:01:12,441
- A day is a day. Besides, you're our
guest. - You're very kind.

1153
01:01:12,566 --> 01:01:14,993
- God will repay you, miss. - You
see.

1154
01:01:15,299 --> 01:01:16,706
You don't have children? - No

1155
01:01:18,219 --> 01:01:19,992
Oh, what do I do? - I don't know.

1156
01:01:20,117 --> 01:01:21,970
- This is my ruin, my ruin. - Do I
open?

1157
01:01:21,971 --> 01:01:24,872
- Yes, but where, where do I hide?
- There, there.

1158
01:01:29,345 --> 01:01:31,414
What silliness Who could it be?

1159
01:01:32,032 --> 01:01:33,130
I'll go see.

1160
01:01:35,132 --> 01:01:38,161
Good evening, we're from the
campaign. Is Concepcion Vivas
here?

1161
01:01:38,162 --> 01:01:41,334
- Yes a poor woman's here. - You
have come with us.

1162
01:01:41,336 --> 01:01:44,208
Me? I've done nothing wrong, I have
an artists license.

1163
01:01:44,209 --> 01:01:45,969
- No, not you, the poor woman.
- But?

1164
01:01:45,982 --> 01:01:47,657
I'm sorry, you have to come with us.

1165
01:01:47,658 --> 01:01:50,790
Come, we're in a hurry. - Don't worry
it's for your good. Nothing's wrong.

1166
01:01:50,791 --> 01:01:54,584
- It's ok, they're from the charity
- Miss, tell the gentleman I had to
leave.

1167
01:01:54,586 --> 01:01:57,152
- Oh yes, of course. Good night.
- Good night.

1168
01:01:57,277 --> 01:01:58,814
Happy Holidays Good Night.

1169
01:01:59,810 --> 01:02:02,358
- A gunshot, it was a shot. - No it's
the festivities.

1170
01:02:02,367 --> 01:02:03,825
The joy of the Holidays.

1171
01:02:04,298 --> 01:02:06,322
Have a good night. - You too

1172
01:02:11,751 --> 01:02:12,948
Ok, they've left.

1173
01:02:14,330 --> 01:02:17,896
- What's wrong love? - This thing, I
got hit in the eye.

1174
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:20,037
- What a night you've given me.
- Hey, look.

1175
01:02:20,322 --> 01:02:23,041
- Look -What, I can't see anything
now.

1176
01:02:23,042 --> 01:02:26,465
- Let's go to the kitchen for some
ice. - No, the kitchen, no. A rest.

1177
01:02:26,852 --> 01:02:32,815
Hail Mary, full of grace. The Lord is
with thee. Blessed art thou amongst
women

1178
01:02:32,940 --> 01:02:37,761
and blessed is the fruit of thy womb,
Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God...

1179
01:02:37,886 --> 01:02:40,392
Antonia! Open.

1180
01:02:40,679 --> 01:02:43,450
- Must be Gabino -Too soon, must
be Alvaro.

1181
01:02:43,964 --> 01:02:47,709
Blessed as he was for years and
year. Amen

1182
01:02:47,710 --> 01:02:50,041
- Let's see if it's your husband. - Ok,
let me go.

1183
01:02:51,235 --> 01:02:52,277
Come in.

1184
01:02:52,843 --> 01:02:57,733
Well then, the sick man is
discharged and so is outside my
jurisdiction

1185
01:02:57,858 --> 01:02:59,889
Besides, I'm above this.

1186
01:02:59,890 --> 01:03:03,375
Doesn't matter in some ways he's
still a subordinate.

1187
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:06,920
I repeat, according to the law of Feb
12, 1861

1188
01:03:06,921 --> 01:03:09,662
A superior judge may act in a case
like this.

1189
01:03:09,787 --> 01:03:12,368
Besides, I assume, in a wedding in
articulo mortis

1190
01:03:12,370 --> 01:03:16,465
The military hierarchy can intervene
in place of the legal authority.

1191
01:03:16,466 --> 01:03:18,506
Commander Carlos

1192
01:03:18,631 --> 01:03:22,468
Good Evening Mr. Carlos. We've
interrupted your dinner. - No
problem

1193
01:03:22,469 --> 01:03:26,800
- Excuse us, but in a case like this.
- Always at your service.

1194
01:03:26,925 --> 01:03:29,867
- Well sirs, that's it, he's calmed
down.

1195
01:03:29,874 --> 01:03:31,438
How? Is he dead?

1196
01:03:31,563 --> 01:03:33,337
No. He just fainted.

1197
01:03:33,338 --> 01:03:35,476
Let's the injection is good for
something.

1198
01:03:35,477 --> 01:03:36,994
Hi, Miss Fonsanta, please.

1199
01:03:36,995 --> 01:03:38,386
Good Evening -Good Evening

1200
01:03:38,387 --> 01:03:42,321
It would have been best to have the
wedding at the office. - We'll if he's
so ill...

1201
01:03:42,338 --> 01:03:45,320
Is it you? We've had to leave home.

1202
01:03:45,759 --> 01:03:48,810
No no, don't put him on. I'm
ashamed.

1203
01:03:50,514 --> 01:03:52,319
Pass, pass this way.

1204
01:03:52,782 --> 01:03:56,613
Yes it's me You actors always see
things like that.

1205
01:03:56,614 --> 01:03:58,148
Sorry, I have to go.

1206
01:03:58,152 --> 01:04:00,722
- We have to fix him up. - Antonia,
bring a veil

1207
01:04:00,847 --> 01:04:06,533
l-l-I was calling to 2-4-3-2, sorry.
Hey girl, who're you talking to?

1208
01:04:06,658 --> 01:04:11,471
Hey? Listen, I won't tolerate this.
Answer me coward. Coward.

1209
01:04:11,474 --> 01:04:14,357
- Have some balls. They're all like
this. - Please Gabino.

1210
01:04:14,359 --> 01:04:18,415
It was the actor, that piece of
garbage. - Hey, the man of...

1211
01:04:18,540 --> 01:04:23,503
- What's your name, I can't recall
- Gabino Quintanilla, son of Lucas,
of the butcher shops.

1212
01:04:23,505 --> 01:04:26,925
We were talking, we were talking
about transporting the sick man.

1213
01:04:27,321 --> 01:04:29,650
That motorcar man, could he take
him?

1214
01:04:29,775 --> 01:04:32,915
I don't know, he's in a hurry.
Something about a note he has to
pay.

1215
01:04:32,916 --> 01:04:35,597
A note is no problem. We pay him
and that's it.

1216
01:04:36,021 --> 01:04:39,897
- Still have a cold? - The worst is my
sinusitis, which'll be chronic.

1217
01:04:39,908 --> 01:04:43,068
Man, don't worry I have bronchial
issues too.

1218
01:04:43,070 --> 01:04:46,370
- Wait, wait a minute. wait. - Gabino
Quintanilla, talk to him.

1219
01:04:46,371 --> 01:04:48,107
Placido! - Yeah woman!

1220
01:04:48,232 --> 01:04:51,008
Placido -Yes It's no issue for you

1221
01:04:51,009 --> 01:04:53,311
Now, after the wedding, we have to
take the sick man.

1222
01:04:53,312 --> 01:04:55,865
No way! What I want is to get paid
and go to the notary.

1223
01:04:55,990 --> 01:04:59,252
- About the notary, I give you my
word. - And my family?

1224
01:04:59,377 --> 01:05:02,986
We haven't dined. That's the least of
it, what bothers me is that darn note.

1225
01:05:02,987 --> 01:05:05,815
- Ahh the note We have to get him
out of here.

1226
01:05:05,940 --> 01:05:09,213
If something happens in my home,
the campaign will be a failure,
understand.

1227
01:05:09,214 --> 01:05:14,440
Placido, I'll fix it. I'll call the notary
and tell him you're delayed. Agreed?
- No

1228
01:05:14,565 --> 01:05:17,392
Take into account that this family will
compensate you, money's always
handy

1229
01:05:17,393 --> 01:05:19,558
And since the I'll fix the deal with the
note.

1230
01:05:19,683 --> 01:05:23,230
Do you know the number?
- Marvelous, marvelous, for me it's a
lifesaver,

1231
01:05:23,239 --> 01:05:24,785
But try it for yourself.

1232
01:05:24,786 --> 01:05:27,010
- Alvaro, he's come to. - He's come
to?

1233
01:05:27,012 --> 01:05:30,682
Don Gabino! But then, when will you
call, Don Gabino!

1234
01:05:30,807 --> 01:05:33,112
Pascual, don't you hear me?

1235
01:05:33,237 --> 01:05:35,669
It's me, your Concheta.

1236
01:05:35,893 --> 01:05:39,047
- They're going to marry us.
- Father, the sooner the better.

1237
01:05:39,053 --> 01:05:40,553
For now he's conscious.

1238
01:05:40,554 --> 01:05:42,588
Bring the flowers from Grandfather's
portrait.

1239
01:05:42,639 --> 01:05:45,089
Please, your name Concepcion
Vivas Brozas

1240
01:05:45,090 --> 01:05:48,640
Concepcion Vivas Brozas, will take
as a husband

1241
01:05:48,765 --> 01:05:51,539

Oyos.

1242
01:05:51,540 --> 01:05:53,314
Yes. Of course yes.

1243
01:05:53,439 --> 01:05:58,536
Pascual Ruiz Oyos, will take as a
wife Concepcion Vivas Brozas

1244
01:06:00,006 --> 01:06:02,012
Ehhh. - But, he's crazy

1245
01:06:02,137 --> 01:06:04,066
In a daze, he's in a daze

1246
01:06:04,191 --> 01:06:05,118
Pascual

1247
01:06:05,243 --> 01:06:08,458
Pascual, you're in bad shape. You
have to marry.

1248
01:06:08,583 --> 01:06:09,878
You're in sin!

1249
01:06:10,003 --> 01:06:11,291
Come, say yes.

1250
01:06:12,298 --> 01:06:13,948
Please, meditate on it.

1251
01:06:15,371 --> 01:06:18,413
What will we do? This man is
stubborn, leave it to me.

1252
01:06:18,414 --> 01:06:20,373
Wait. Insist Father, insist.

1253
01:06:20,498 --> 01:06:23,250
Come, Pascual, give me an answer

1254
01:06:23,258 --> 01:06:27,186
Pascual, it's me. Your Concheta

1255
01:06:27,512 --> 01:06:29,266
You've always loved me.

1256
01:06:29,596 --> 01:06:32,217
Say yes, Pascual Say yes.

1257
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:37,831
Don Gabino, please. Pay me or call
the notary.

1258
01:06:37,832 --> 01:06:43,472
- What a pain you are. - Don
Gabino, put it on, put it on Don
Gabino

1259
01:06:43,597 --> 01:06:44,836
Look, you plug it in.

1260
01:06:45,997 --> 01:06:47,654
- And you breathe. - Come on,
please

1261
01:06:47,662 --> 01:06:51,361
It doesn't matter that it's used? My
God, I wouldn't lend it to you if it did.

1262
01:06:51,486 --> 01:06:53,815
Now breathe deeply, with rhythm

1263
01:06:53,940 --> 01:06:56,149
- Well, how is it? - A little sour, isn't
it?

1264
01:06:56,158 --> 01:06:59,367
- But that's what cures you.
- Please, Don Gabino, don't waste
more time.

1265
01:06:59,492 --> 01:07:01,574
- Call the notary, now. - Get that kid
to be quiet.

1266
01:07:01,575 --> 01:07:03,586
- Quiet, there's a moribund man.
- Emilia

1267
01:07:03,634 --> 01:07:06,496
Look Placido, I can't take anymore.
I'll take the family and kids

1268
01:07:06,497 --> 01:07:08,620
- And go even if we have to walk.
- Wait, wait

1269
01:07:08,662 --> 01:07:11,751
Hello Is this Mr. Gil's home?

1270
01:07:11,876 --> 01:07:14,205
Is Mr. Gil home? It's Quintanilla.

1271
01:07:14,330 --> 01:07:16,735
- From the butcher shops. - From
the butcher shops.

1272
01:07:16,860 --> 01:07:19,410
I'm with the man with the note. He'll
be a bit delayed.

1273
01:07:19,535 --> 01:07:22,564
- Please, take that thing off man.
- We'll be there in a bit.

1274
01:07:22,689 --> 01:07:25,110
Thank you Mr. Gil. And Happy...

1275
01:07:25,979 --> 01:07:27,130
Holidays

1276
01:07:27,525 --> 01:07:30,327
That's it, now you can relax Have a
drink

1277
01:07:30,336 --> 01:07:32,622
Can he have a drink? Of course! A
small drink?

1278
01:07:32,630 --> 01:07:34,753
Come, have a drink

1279
01:07:34,761 --> 01:07:37,761
Tonight's Christmas Eve. Take it.

1280
01:07:37,886 --> 01:07:41,010
Listen, please, my family, could they
eat something?

1281
01:07:41,011 --> 01:07:43,959
Really now, it's just an instant. We're
guests.

1282
01:07:44,010 --> 01:07:45,289
Excuse him.

1283
01:07:45,307 --> 01:07:48,418
Hey, and Pascual? I don't know, let's
go see.

1284
01:07:48,443 --> 01:07:49,613
What a mess, for sure.

1285
01:07:49,621 --> 01:07:51,155
I breathe deeply, but...

1286
01:07:51,954 --> 01:07:56,157
Go on, go on. At the start you always
cough a bit.

1287
01:07:56,165 --> 01:07:58,360
But it's a healthy expectoration.

1288
01:07:58,485 --> 01:08:01,467
It wouldn't be the first time it saved
me from pneumonia.

1289
01:08:01,963 --> 01:08:06,578
Pascual. Let's go Pascual, let's go.
Say yes.

1290
01:08:08,438 --> 01:08:10,879
Join hands, please.

1291
01:08:11,543 --> 01:08:14,358
Ego conyugo vos in matrimonio.

1292
01:08:14,483 --> 01:08:19,441
In nomini patris et filio Et espiritu
santi. Amen.

1293
01:08:19,566 --> 01:08:23,293
- In good time, Concheta -Be
happy.

1294
01:08:23,418 --> 01:08:25,087
So, are you done being angry? - No.

1295
01:08:25,088 --> 01:08:27,026
And I have a cold because of you.

1296
01:08:27,033 --> 01:08:31,006
He called me. As queen of the ball I
had to answer.

1297
01:08:31,131 --> 01:08:34,114
I'm not interested at all, those actors
are so fresh.

1298
01:08:34,115 --> 01:08:36,325
- Listen, what's wrong? - I'm a
woman as God intended.

1299
01:08:36,442 --> 01:08:39,519
A recidivist that's what you are.
- Gabino, let's go eat.

1300
01:08:41,212 --> 01:08:43,085
Mr. Quintanilla

1301
01:08:43,801 --> 01:08:47,986
Listen, Don Gabino, this man with
the note, will he take him? Yes or
no?

1302
01:08:47,987 --> 01:08:50,622
Take him as soon as possible, soon
as possible.

1303
01:08:50,748 --> 01:08:53,511
Because you'll understand, on a
night like this, this situation

1304
01:08:53,516 --> 01:08:56,172
It's very unpleasant, very
unpleasant.

1305
01:08:58,415 --> 01:09:01,138
I'm not waiting anymore. If someone
wants ham, follow me.

1306
01:09:01,139 --> 01:09:03,623
- Slow down. - No Placido, he's
right.

1307
01:09:03,670 --> 01:09:06,228
You can't go around all night, this
way and that, with the kids.

1308
01:09:06,253 --> 01:09:08,097
I know Emilia, I know. It's just a
moment.

1309
01:09:08,105 --> 01:09:10,765
I've already agreed with Mr.
Quintanilla, We'll go eat.

1310
01:09:10,890 --> 01:09:12,433
So, Don Gabino, do we take him or
not?

1311
01:09:12,552 --> 01:09:14,329
We take him, we take him. So the
man will agree?

1312
01:09:14,330 --> 01:09:16,402
- lf it's quick yes. - In that case let's
go.

1313
01:09:16,616 --> 01:09:19,641
- Maruja! - Gentlemen, I think he's
died.

1314
01:09:20,384 --> 01:09:23,023
- He's died? - Gabino, give me the
20 bucks, I'm leaving.

1315
01:09:23,031 --> 01:09:25,768
What you're leaving? Naturally, no
we don't have to take him.

1316
01:09:25,769 --> 01:09:28,975
Precisely, that's why we have to get
him out of here. - Matias, please.

1317
01:09:28,976 --> 01:09:32,853
No pleases. This dead man isn't
ours and I don't want him here a
single second longer.

1318
01:09:32,978 --> 01:09:34,679
Miss. We have to remove the
cadaver.

1319
01:09:34,804 --> 01:09:37,959
We can't take him on the truck with
us, everyone would find out.

1320
01:09:38,084 --> 01:09:39,761
- I'm sorry. - What do you say,
doctor?

1321
01:09:39,762 --> 01:09:42,499
Well I, to tell you the truth, can't
certify him. - Why not?

1322
01:09:42,624 --> 01:09:45,604
You'll understand. My specialty is
extractions.

1323
01:09:45,613 --> 01:09:48,711
- But if a patient died, who'd certify?
- The judge.

1324
01:09:48,837 --> 01:09:53,003
Fine, fine, I'm not interested in this
deal. You pay me for services
rendered and that's it.

1325
01:09:53,004 --> 01:09:56,202
Calm down, calm. Your job is
transportation, as I understand.
- Yes

1326
01:09:56,203 --> 01:09:59,816
Good, then you'll transport the dead
man, we pay you and Happy
holidays.

1327
01:09:59,817 --> 01:10:02,787
- Besides I've already called the
notary. - Fine, let's get this over with.

1328
01:10:02,796 --> 01:10:06,464
I'll take him, but first I go to the
notary, eh. You can't leave a dead
man on the street!

1329
01:10:06,572 --> 01:10:09,769
Oh no, with me has to come one
you, who's responsible.

1330
01:10:09,793 --> 01:10:11,889
- lf I go alone and a guard stops
me? - Gabino

1331
01:10:11,890 --> 01:10:14,150
Gabino! - No, not me.

1332
01:10:14,158 --> 01:10:16,452
- No, not me! - Come, Gabino, you
can't deny him.

1333
01:10:16,453 --> 01:10:18,533
Come, Martita, you ask him.

1334
01:10:18,658 --> 01:10:22,472
Go, go my love do it for me. I'm very
tired.

1335
01:10:22,756 --> 01:10:25,978
It's always up to me to do the dirty
work. Hey, Julian, lend me a hand.

1336
01:10:25,979 --> 01:10:28,501
- We have to take the dead man.
- What a role you've found.

1337
01:10:28,502 --> 01:10:29,549
Feel better?

1338
01:10:29,550 --> 01:10:32,739
- Yes thank you Rodolfo -You know
that it's always at your service.

1339
01:10:32,741 --> 01:10:34,417
What a disaster! - The cable...

1340
01:10:34,451 --> 01:10:36,853
I think we can't take him out like this.

1341
01:10:36,978 --> 01:10:40,148
Mrs. Maria, I think we should cover
him with a blanket.

1342
01:10:40,149 --> 01:10:43,914
Yes, yes yes yes Antonia! Bring an
old blanket, and my coat.

1343
01:10:43,919 --> 01:10:46,218
- Did they get married? - Married.
As God intended.

1344
01:10:46,222 --> 01:10:49,953
Child, what are you doing. - It's time
- The day I think of...

1345
01:10:49,958 --> 01:10:53,579
- Shut up father, shut up. - Such a
cute kid. You raise him yourself?

1346
01:10:53,622 --> 01:10:56,472
Yes, but he already eats everything.
He's 3 months old.

1347
01:10:56,481 --> 01:10:59,634
Edmundo, still have bonds from the
campaign? - I still have a few.

1348
01:10:59,635 --> 01:11:02,319
- Give one to this poor woman.
- Food or clothing?

1349
01:11:02,444 --> 01:11:05,499
- Oh my god, It smells bad in here.
- It's the cheese.

1350
01:11:05,504 --> 01:11:07,642
Do you want a piece? - No man, I
don't want cheese.

1351
01:11:07,643 --> 01:11:09,387
How complicated life can be

1352
01:11:09,388 --> 01:11:10,762
Ma'am, here's a blanket.

1353
01:11:10,763 --> 01:11:13,349
- This way ma'am, go ahead
- Please, permit me a moment.

1354
01:11:13,350 --> 01:11:15,292
Paquito, you take the basket.

1355
01:11:16,035 --> 01:11:18,991
Wait a moment, I think a neighbor is
going down.

1356
01:11:20,082 --> 01:11:21,131
Boys.

1357
01:11:22,308 --> 01:11:26,142
Boys, don't be afraid. It's just a man
who's asleep.

1358
01:11:26,415 --> 01:11:29,710
Listen, excuse me for insisting about
my fee.

1359
01:11:29,835 --> 01:11:33,346
Oh yes, don't go yet, I'll consult with
the Aranzadi

1360
01:11:41,054 --> 01:11:44,191
Oh my god. - Careful, careful

1361
01:11:44,231 --> 01:11:46,191
How unfortunate I've been.

1362
01:11:47,807 --> 01:11:49,435
Ay, Pascual

1363
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:53,135
- Paquito, watch the basket. - On
this night

1364
01:11:53,260 --> 01:11:56,186
- A moment, a moment. - Do we
rest?

1365
01:11:56,212 --> 01:11:57,639
No, better in one go.

1366
01:11:58,415 --> 01:11:59,714
Come, we're there.

1367
01:12:03,538 --> 01:12:05,179
My poor love.

1368
01:12:09,408 --> 01:12:12,225
- Paquito, son, don't push. - I can't
with the basket.

1369
01:12:12,227 --> 01:12:13,269
Be careful.

1370
01:12:17,099 --> 01:12:18,396
What a misfortune.

1371
01:12:18,406 --> 01:12:20,201
What a pity mom, a pity. - My god.

1372
01:12:20,326 --> 01:12:23,134
I'm going to bring the priest closer, I'll
be right back.

1373
01:12:23,862 --> 01:12:27,127
Oh dear God. - Let's go, let's go

1374
01:12:27,128 --> 01:12:28,541
Watch out he's slipping.

1375
01:12:28,554 --> 01:12:31,045
- I can't go further, couldn't we bring
the other car closer?

1376
01:12:31,046 --> 01:12:33,752
- Pull, pull, it's just 2 steps -I'm
already tired.

1377
01:12:34,126 --> 01:12:35,484
Help her out, stop.

1378
01:12:36,444 --> 01:12:39,132
- How he loved riding in cars. - Bring
it down, girl.

1379
01:12:39,934 --> 01:12:41,464
Gabino

1380
01:12:44,461 --> 01:12:46,489
- And now what do we do? - Give
her to me.

1381
01:12:46,490 --> 01:12:48,160
Get on, you get on first.

1382
01:12:49,008 --> 01:12:50,683
Ok, up. - Go.

1383
01:12:52,428 --> 01:12:53,470
My God.

1384
01:12:54,129 --> 01:12:56,050
Lend a hand. - Yes, yes.

1385
01:12:59,642 --> 01:13:01,447
It's done. - Cover him up well.

1386
01:13:02,942 --> 01:13:04,719
Let's tie him, Julian.

1387
01:13:05,615 --> 01:13:08,107
Oh, how he loved riding in cars.

1388
01:13:10,445 --> 01:13:11,542
Leave it, Leave it.

1389
01:13:12,382 --> 01:13:15,329
Well, with all this, those people
haven't compensated me.

1390
01:13:15,330 --> 01:13:16,850
Oh no? Well then tomorrow.

1391
01:13:16,851 --> 01:13:19,241
Tomorrow! Tomorrow they'll want
nothing to do with it. - Sure man.

1392
01:13:19,245 --> 01:13:21,383
I should leave the dead man strewn
on the street.

1393
01:13:21,384 --> 01:13:22,906
The widow, be sensitive.

1394
01:13:22,909 --> 01:13:25,065
Besides, the important thing was the
note, no?

1395
01:13:25,066 --> 01:13:26,144
Fine let's go now!

1396
01:13:27,549 --> 01:13:29,724
Hold him well. - Don't worry sir.

1397
01:13:30,402 --> 01:13:31,794
Imagine we lose him.

1398
01:13:32,261 --> 01:13:33,303
Do I go?

1399
01:13:35,012 --> 01:13:36,054
Let's go.

1400
01:13:55,994 --> 01:13:57,901
Thank goodness, it's all sorted out.

1401
01:13:57,902 --> 01:14:00,539
- A pleasure. The pleasure was ours
ma'am.

1402
01:14:00,540 --> 01:14:03,969
- Matias, say goodbye to Mrs.
Encarnacion. - Ahh, good evening
Ma'am

1403
01:14:04,095 --> 01:14:07,363
And you Don Poli, thank you.
Tomorrow we'll talk about...

1404
01:14:07,364 --> 01:14:08,751
No, no -Let's go Edmundo.

1405
01:14:08,764 --> 01:14:10,708
Excuse me, but I've left my two
sisters alone.

1406
01:14:10,709 --> 01:14:14,318
Don't worry. Let's go, let's go Martita

1407
01:14:15,138 --> 01:14:18,173
Goodbye friend, I'm sorry I couldn't
provide you a good night.

1408
01:14:18,174 --> 01:14:19,596
No, but I'm not leaving.

1409
01:14:19,721 --> 01:14:23,271
Well, I'm just saying, since we left
the dinner unfinished. I don't mind
returning.

1410
01:14:23,272 --> 01:14:26,279
Of course, go ahead. But it'll be cold

1411
01:14:28,633 --> 01:14:31,973
Christmas eve is coming Christmas
eve is going.

1412
01:14:32,099 --> 01:14:35,419
And we will go away And we'll never
return.

1413
01:14:35,459 --> 01:14:38,859
- The fault is yours. - No it was you
who wanted to change him.

1414
01:14:38,860 --> 01:14:41,788
You insisted on giving him a drink,
and you see how he's gotten.

1415
01:14:41,789 --> 01:14:45,122
Calm down. Drink some coffee, drink
it. Go. Drink it.

1416
01:14:46,125 --> 01:14:50,258
- All the blackies drink some coffee.
- I can't stand any more.

1417
01:14:50,262 --> 01:14:52,575
You'll see what you do with your poor
man. I, but...

1418
01:14:52,700 --> 01:14:54,974
I'm going to change. We won't make
midnight mass.

1419
01:14:55,430 --> 01:14:57,841
Fine woman, fine, fine.

1420
01:14:57,966 --> 01:15:00,430
Fine calm down. Relax.

1421
01:15:00,472 --> 01:15:04,322
We're going to the midnight mass
No, don't drink any more.

1422
01:15:04,447 --> 01:15:08,055
You'll stay here, until they come to
pick you up.

1423
01:15:08,181 --> 01:15:11,099
Here, sit down. Yes, stay still.

1424
01:15:11,112 --> 01:15:13,860
- Do you like jotas?
- Yes, a lot.

1425
01:15:13,985 --> 01:15:15,982
I know a very pretty one.

1426
01:15:16,585 --> 01:15:20,301
I gave you one on the roof top And
gave you one on the stairway...

1427
01:15:20,310 --> 01:15:23,633
Another on the stairs. - Some men
are here to pay a note.

1428
01:15:23,634 --> 01:15:27,148
- Tell me tomorrow how many there
were. - At this hour? This is a bad
joke.

1429
01:15:27,788 --> 01:15:29,940
Dear Mr. Gil, Quintanilla, of the
butcher shops

1430
01:15:29,941 --> 01:15:33,561
- I've come her with Mr. - the hat-
- At 12? - We've called ahead.

1431
01:15:33,562 --> 01:15:37,326
Who called? -Shut up
- No, nothing really it's a case of...

1432
01:15:37,331 --> 01:15:40,870
Imagine, all afternoon worried about
the note. - The point, the point.

1433
01:15:40,882 --> 01:15:44,155
I'll listen in honor of your father, but
you shouldn't bother one on a night
like this.

1434
01:15:44,180 --> 01:15:47,173
Go into my office. - You, relax.

1435
01:15:47,298 --> 01:15:49,657
Sleep it off son, sleep it off.

1436
01:15:49,701 --> 01:15:52,405
There you are, there you are. Good.

1437
01:15:52,530 --> 01:15:55,734
Let's not lose time. I won't make it to
midnight mass.

1438
01:15:55,751 --> 01:15:59,050
- In whose name is it? - Placido,
Placido Alonso, at your service.

1439
01:15:59,175 --> 01:16:02,506
I was here on time, you see, but then
with the stuff about the expenses.

1440
01:16:02,540 --> 01:16:05,493
- And then since Mr. Quintanilla
called you. - But who called who?

1441
01:16:05,494 --> 01:16:07,715
- Mr. Quintanilla called you. - It's of
no importance

1442
01:16:07,716 --> 01:16:10,450
- You didn't call. - How much is it?
- 6820

1443
01:16:10,454 --> 01:16:12,836
- Here they are. Count it. - Wait, just
a moment.

1444
01:16:12,962 --> 01:16:16,552
- But, this letter doesn't list the
collateral. - What, so there's more
expenses?

1445
01:16:16,566 --> 01:16:19,993
No, simply that if you hadn't paid,
nothing would have happened.

1446
01:16:20,010 --> 01:16:22,550
So let's see. I don't pay it and
nothing happens?

1447
01:16:22,580 --> 01:16:24,844
That's it. The article lacks executive
power.

1448
01:16:24,845 --> 01:16:28,428
- Sirs, Happy Holidays. - Wait.
Morally you're obliged to pay.

1449
01:16:28,458 --> 01:16:31,132
No! With what this damned note has
made me suffer. I'm not paying.

1450
01:16:31,136 --> 01:16:33,263
Besides, the intention has been
noted. - Listen

1451
01:16:33,271 --> 01:16:37,064
Listen, if you don't pay it now it'll be
claimed in a trial.

1452
01:16:37,189 --> 01:16:39,891
- Fine, do what you want. - How
much? - 143.90

1453
01:16:39,899 --> 01:16:40,942
Hundred

1454
01:16:44,659 --> 01:16:45,951
And you don't give me anything?

1455
01:16:45,993 --> 01:16:49,456
The important thing was the note
right? Don't greedy.

1456
01:16:49,581 --> 01:16:52,048
And make note that this comes from
my own pocket.

1457
01:16:52,056 --> 01:16:55,306
You're cheeky, you didn't make the
call, you don't give me anything.

1458
01:16:55,316 --> 01:16:57,046
The fault is mine for being an idiot.

1459
01:16:57,059 --> 01:17:00,456
- Look, I take the note with no
illusions. - Here's your letter.

1460
01:17:00,581 --> 01:17:03,844
- Your change. - Many thanks Mr.
Gil

1461
01:17:03,845 --> 01:17:07,187
Happy Holidays I'll say hi to dad on
your behalf.

1462
01:17:08,034 --> 01:17:09,756
Are you ready? Yes

1463
01:17:09,881 --> 01:17:13,249
- Ma'am, very sorry for the bother.
- We won't make it in time.

1464
01:17:13,374 --> 01:17:18,402
- Let me throw your friends out of
here. - What a fondness this man
has taken to us.

1465
01:17:18,428 --> 01:17:20,340
Lie down, tumble down.

1466
01:17:20,465 --> 01:17:22,369
Goodbye -I should tumble?

1467
01:17:22,407 --> 01:17:27,965
- What church are we going to? - I
have a tumbler to wash my clothes.

1468
01:17:28,013 --> 01:17:30,534
I have a tumbler

1469
01:17:30,659 --> 01:17:32,502
Come here, fallen one.

1470
01:17:37,129 --> 01:17:42,565
Oh Mother Ines, all the blackies drink
coffee.

1471
01:17:42,690 --> 01:17:47,197
She was on my right man. Yeah but
to turn you have to signal. I signaled
If you had signaled.

1472
01:17:47,198 --> 01:17:49,380
It's not my fault. Hey, can't you see!

1473
01:17:53,356 --> 01:17:55,129
Shut up for once.

1474
01:17:55,936 --> 01:18:00,600
Slow, the basket will fall. Slow, slow,
let's get this over with.

1475
01:18:00,601 --> 01:18:03,785
Where's the house? A little further.
Poor Pascual.

1476
01:18:03,786 --> 01:18:05,857
It can't be changed now ma'am.

1477
01:18:05,861 --> 01:18:10,342
It has to happen to all of us
someday. He was so good.

1478
01:18:10,467 --> 01:18:12,364
Around there, the stairs.

1479
01:18:13,195 --> 01:18:15,752
Come on, it's the near the barracks.

1480
01:18:16,248 --> 01:18:19,050
- Watch it, I'm braking. - I did my
service here.

1481
01:18:19,469 --> 01:18:20,511
Quickly.

1482
01:18:21,203 --> 01:18:25,627
Courage woman, now you have to
think of yourself and make heart
from guts.

1483
01:18:25,931 --> 01:18:27,324
You have to live.

1484
01:18:27,449 --> 01:18:29,149
Watch it Placido, use your shoulder.

1485
01:18:36,272 --> 01:18:37,919
Stop. Who's there?

1486
01:18:38,163 --> 01:18:39,314
Good people.

1487
01:18:39,439 --> 01:18:42,216
- What people? - Christmas
campaign.

1488
01:18:42,433 --> 01:18:44,752
We're compatriots We have a sick
man.

1489
01:18:44,774 --> 01:18:47,232
- But isn't he dead? - Shut up, don't
make waves.

1490
01:18:47,986 --> 01:18:49,383
May we? - Continue

1491
01:18:52,555 --> 01:18:54,081
Where is it? There, there.

1492
01:18:56,586 --> 01:18:57,699
This way, this way.

1493
01:18:59,033 --> 01:19:02,054
- I can't any longer. - Of course,
since you're not used to it.

1494
01:19:02,060 --> 01:19:04,139
And you have the light part.

1495
01:19:04,467 --> 01:19:06,718
My God, what will become of me
now.

1496
01:19:07,468 --> 01:19:08,676
We're here.

1497
01:19:09,037 --> 01:19:11,254
Let's see where do we put him?
There on the bed.

1498
01:19:12,420 --> 01:19:13,878
This way, so narrow?

1499
01:19:16,088 --> 01:19:18,208
My God, this is old age.

1500
01:19:18,596 --> 01:19:19,778
The head.

1501
01:19:20,136 --> 01:19:23,237
Watch out Placido, I can't fit. Ok,
now.

1502
01:19:23,362 --> 01:19:25,597
We have to put him on the bed. Let's
see.

1503
01:19:27,390 --> 01:19:28,727
My old age.

1504
01:19:29,895 --> 01:19:31,741
He's crooked. - From sitting.

1505
01:19:32,128 --> 01:19:33,170
With this cold.

1506
01:19:34,470 --> 01:19:37,255
Poor Pascual, Poor little Pascual.

1507
01:19:41,549 --> 01:19:42,688
What do we do?

1508
01:19:43,465 --> 01:19:44,766
We have to go.

1509
01:19:44,771 --> 01:19:45,975
We have to eat.

1510
01:19:46,100 --> 01:19:47,996
I feel sorry for her. - Excuse me

1511
01:19:48,230 --> 01:19:49,704
You're very kind.

1512
01:19:49,829 --> 01:19:52,197
Calm down, he's perfectly fine in
there.

1513
01:19:52,207 --> 01:19:55,147
- Yes, but he'll have to be buried.
- Certainly, but don't worry

1514
01:19:55,148 --> 01:19:58,525
The van will take care of it. Please,
sit down. Sit down

1515
01:19:58,543 --> 01:20:02,276
Thank you ma'am, but we have to
go. The campaign.

1516
01:20:02,277 --> 01:20:04,243
Of course. - Bring the basket.

1517
01:20:04,246 --> 01:20:06,566
- You're going to give it to her?
- Bring anything from it.

1518
01:20:06,575 --> 01:20:08,411
- Ham, sausage, any... But it's
mine.

1519
01:20:08,536 --> 01:20:12,645
- We have to console her. - Yes I
agree, you'll eat a little something.

1520
01:20:12,770 --> 01:20:14,327
Thank you.

1521
01:20:14,452 --> 01:20:17,458
Come, come, you don't need to
thank us. But we have to leave.

1522
01:20:17,462 --> 01:20:19,772
Hey. - Go kid. - I'm going.

1523
01:20:19,897 --> 01:20:23,346
Run, take up a package. Hurry.

1524
01:20:24,088 --> 01:20:25,175
What cold

1525
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:26,562
What a night.

1526
01:20:27,268 --> 01:20:31,132
How unfortunate, now that he was
going to get a place in the town hall.

1527
01:20:31,149 --> 01:20:34,607
Take it. - With the hope he had.

1528
01:20:34,887 --> 01:20:38,837
Oh dear God, what a life. And on
Christmas of all days.

1529
01:20:39,239 --> 01:20:42,542
Take it, take it. You probably didn't
have dinner.

1530
01:20:42,546 --> 01:20:45,200
Eat, eat. You have to resign yourself
and come out ahead.

1531
01:20:45,201 --> 01:20:47,968
The important thing is not to let
yourself go. Come, eat something.

1532
01:20:47,969 --> 01:20:50,840
Eat, good woman, Pascual is in
heaven.

1533
01:20:51,139 --> 01:20:55,227
- Come, a little effort. A little effort.
- Weakness is worse.

1534
01:20:56,063 --> 01:20:59,349
You're all very kind. With the hope
we had.

1535
01:20:59,729 --> 01:21:02,821
And now... You never know what's
best.

1536
01:21:03,858 --> 01:21:05,358
Resignation.

1537
01:21:08,196 --> 01:21:11,213
- My thoughts are with you. - We're
nothing.

1538
01:21:11,979 --> 01:21:13,021
Goodbye friend.

1539
01:21:13,928 --> 01:21:16,110
- Well, as we said. - Have a good
night.

1540
01:21:17,926 --> 01:21:20,384
And the campaign was going so well.
What a fatality.

1541
01:21:26,073 --> 01:21:27,444
My poor guy.

1542
01:21:27,648 --> 01:21:29,691
The hope he had.

1543
01:21:36,193 --> 01:21:39,029
Poor woman, she'll be alone with the
dead man.

1544
01:21:39,154 --> 01:21:41,961
- On a night like this. - What, do you
want us to stay with her?

1545
01:21:42,086 --> 01:21:44,500
No, but... - Don't start now.

1546
01:21:44,501 --> 01:21:46,812
Ok. What's the widow doing?

1547
01:21:46,820 --> 01:21:49,105
Nothing, what'll she do. Come, let's
go home.

1548
01:21:49,382 --> 01:21:52,098
What a night you're giving me.

1549
01:21:52,111 --> 01:21:54,782
Placido, please, take me to the De
Galan's home.

1550
01:21:54,784 --> 01:21:56,819
Don Gabino, we haven't eaten, man.

1551
01:21:56,835 --> 01:21:59,161
Julian, I'm going to turn the motorcar
around.

1552
01:21:59,286 --> 01:22:01,295
But, you can't leave me here.

1553
01:22:02,990 --> 01:22:05,664
- I'm too far from home. - Well get
yourself a cab.

1554
01:22:05,789 --> 01:22:07,611
What taxi? Besides, I'm sick.

1555
01:22:08,069 --> 01:22:11,191
- Listen, can you take photos at
night? - Yes

1556
01:22:11,602 --> 01:22:15,051
Why don't you take a picture of us all
in the motor car, with the star.

1557
01:22:15,176 --> 01:22:16,519
It would be pretty.

1558
01:22:16,838 --> 01:22:19,632
Well, look, that's an idea. I'll do it if
you'll take me.

1559
01:22:20,260 --> 01:22:23,097
Stop, we're going to have our picture
taken. - Placido, a moment.

1560
01:22:23,131 --> 01:22:26,676
Stop, I'm going to take a picture, as
a souvenir.

1561
01:22:26,801 --> 01:22:28,879
Listen, the girl's getting a cold, Don
Gabino.

1562
01:22:28,881 --> 01:22:31,072
Am I good like this? Look this way.

1563
01:22:31,112 --> 01:22:35,683
Bah another day, we're in a hurry.
Leave it. The child, a smile from the
child.

1564
01:22:35,700 --> 01:22:37,524
We live in San Sisto, no.

1565
01:22:37,649 --> 01:22:39,537
Put on happy faces.

1566
01:22:40,262 --> 01:22:42,037
There it is. - Come, get in.

1567
01:22:42,780 --> 01:22:47,790
Happy Holidays, Don Gabino! My
girlfriend's waiting!

1568
01:23:18,664 --> 01:23:19,706
Out.

1569
01:23:19,738 --> 01:23:25,289
Hey Manolo, have a look at my
motor car. Happy Holidays.

1570
01:23:25,290 --> 01:23:29,542
- You too. - Thanks, goodbye. Ugh, I
got Quintanilla's cold.

1571
01:23:29,667 --> 01:23:33,289
Come Placido, pick it all up. The
tablecloth. Yes Emilia

1572
01:23:33,414 --> 01:23:36,051
Come, thank God we're home.

1573
01:23:36,176 --> 01:23:37,376
It's about time.

1574
01:23:37,773 --> 01:23:39,688
What a night you've given me,

1575
01:23:39,813 --> 01:23:41,016
Come, Paquito.

1576
01:23:41,737 --> 01:23:43,884
Father, be careful with the steps.

1577
01:23:44,799 --> 01:23:47,195
- Is there sea bream? - No, there's
no sea bream.

1578
01:23:47,321 --> 01:23:48,776
Just what we needed.

1579
01:23:48,901 --> 01:23:52,537
A Christmas Eve with no sea bream.
Is not Christmas Eve.

1580
01:23:52,662 --> 01:23:54,645
Forget the sea bream.

1581
01:23:54,696 --> 01:23:57,741
Partridges, foie gras, sweet ham.

1582
01:23:57,973 --> 01:24:00,094
Oh Paquito. How you're going to
enjoy it.

1583
01:24:00,219 --> 01:24:02,862
I want a Zambomba, Shut up you
fussy boy.

1584
01:24:02,987 --> 01:24:06,778
What a disaster. - You're tired. I
can't see anything.

1585
01:24:06,903 --> 01:24:09,564
Come Paquito, bring the crib so the
girl will be with us.

1586
01:24:09,573 --> 01:24:11,729
- I'm going. - Today we're going to
eat modern food.

1587
01:24:11,746 --> 01:24:14,842
- Like the Americans. - I want sea
bream.

1588
01:24:14,967 --> 01:24:17,614
The problem is you're not used to
eating well.

1589
01:24:17,627 --> 01:24:19,870
Or do you think rich people eat sea
bream?

1590
01:24:19,995 --> 01:24:22,232
No, I don't like tin cans.

1591
01:24:22,357 --> 01:24:24,095
They give you scurvy.

1592
01:24:24,221 --> 01:24:27,877
Come, look at this cheese. The
preserve them...

1593
01:24:28,002 --> 01:24:29,701
Come, Emilia. Are we eating or
what?

1594
01:24:29,986 --> 01:24:33,143
- I don't feel like anything. - On
Christmas Eve you have to eat.

1595
01:24:33,159 --> 01:24:34,349
Of course.

1596
01:24:34,474 --> 01:24:36,064
Fine, make us whatever, then.

1597
01:24:36,065 --> 01:24:40,153
Ok, time to turn on the stove. I would
have gone to bed.

1598
01:24:40,174 --> 01:24:43,831
But turn on the stove, we everything
here. Look.

1599
01:24:43,956 --> 01:24:47,892
- Asparagus, pork meat, banded
cigars -Don't talk so much.

1600
01:24:47,903 --> 01:24:50,775
Go get the table and chairs, they
belong to the ladies and will get lost.

1601
01:24:50,793 --> 01:24:54,474
Come Julian, and next month, again
with the same mess.

1602
01:24:54,491 --> 01:24:56,198
Don't be a glutton.

1603
01:24:56,216 --> 01:25:00,584
- Who me? Why do I care about
that? - Turn off the radio, grandpa,
it's late.

1604
01:25:01,496 --> 01:25:04,517
- The girl is coughing. - She'll get
bad.

1605
01:25:04,642 --> 01:25:08,889
Damn it all. Of course, all night this
way and that catching cold.

1606
01:25:09,551 --> 01:25:11,035
Poor thing

1607
01:25:11,160 --> 01:25:12,716
Right now, man, return it.

1608
01:25:12,841 --> 01:25:15,359
Where's the basket? You'll go to jail
as a thief.

1609
01:25:16,243 --> 01:25:20,779
- Emilia! - What is it? What's wrong
that they make such a racket?

1610
01:25:20,780 --> 01:25:23,091
What do I know what's gotten into
them now.

1611
01:25:24,536 --> 01:25:27,304
Placido, what a racket, what's wrong.

1612
01:25:27,305 --> 01:25:31,723
- Bring the basket! - Hey it's mine.
I'm telling you it's mine.

1613
01:25:31,848 --> 01:25:35,511
- Return it to me. - Besides, you
haven't paid me anything, exploiter!

1614
01:25:35,890 --> 01:25:38,925
But what's happened? The owner of
the basket. He's come to claim it.

1615
01:25:38,926 --> 01:25:41,406
- Didn't they give it to him? - That's
what he said, but look.

1616
01:25:41,431 --> 01:25:43,808
Man are you willing to repeat that
about being a swindler.

1617
01:25:43,863 --> 01:25:46,400
Of course I'll repeat it, where you
like, bandit.

1618
01:25:46,525 --> 01:25:49,051
Everyone will know you're a family of
thieves.

1619
01:25:49,052 --> 01:25:50,940
Leave the family out, leave it out.

1620
01:25:50,988 --> 01:25:54,235
Here's the basket, check to see
nothing's missing. Give it to him.

1621
01:25:54,360 --> 01:25:56,330
Didn't you say I'd get tips?

1622
01:25:56,455 --> 01:25:59,742
You're the thief!
- Come shut it. - Yeah it's best that
he shut it.

1623
01:25:59,867 --> 01:26:02,836
He should, tonight I'm not doing
anything because it's Christmas Eve.

1624
01:26:02,869 --> 01:26:05,181
In the morning I'll file a complaint, for
this.

1625
01:26:05,206 --> 01:26:09,976
Let's see if you dare. I too can
denounce you, for not sending
bottles you bill for.

1626
01:26:10,101 --> 01:26:14,535
Besides, they shave weight. I've
seen it. I'll leave your other leg like
the first.

1627
01:26:14,540 --> 01:26:16,085
If you have the guts.

1628
01:26:16,210 --> 01:26:17,573
Go in, you.

1629
01:26:18,225 --> 01:26:19,665
Bandit!

1630
01:26:20,554 --> 01:26:25,590
- I'll break your leg. - I'll kill him.
- Come Placido. Come Julian, leave
him

1631
01:26:25,641 --> 01:26:29,620
Come inside, come get inside. And
you go away, idiot.

1632
01:26:29,745 --> 01:26:33,272
- I'll go when I want to. - Loser.
- Come up.

1633
01:26:33,397 --> 01:26:36,923
Come up if you're a man. I'm waiting.
Coward

1634
01:26:37,169 --> 01:26:40,094
Good for nothing You're good for
nothings.

1635
01:26:41,353 --> 01:26:43,404
All these wretches are the same.

1636
01:26:46,188 --> 01:26:50,543
Mother at the door's a child

1637
01:26:50,597 --> 01:26:54,105
Shivering is he from cold

1638
01:26:54,152 --> 01:26:58,430
Go tell him to come in. He will get
warmed up.

1639
01:26:58,681 --> 01:27:03,018
Because in this land there's no
longer charity.

1640
01:27:03,264 --> 01:27:05,757
And there's never been.

1641
01:27:05,761 --> 01:27:09,141
And never will there be.
