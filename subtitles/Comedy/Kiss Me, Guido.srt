Warren will bring you
your money tonight.

158
00:10:24,505 --> 00:10:26,871
I promise.

159

what time I'm gonna be home.

You have a date?
Who's the lucky guy?

164
00:10:40,154 --> 00:10:45,615
Some guy from my therapy group.
Divorced, three times.

He's a Virgo, I'm Taurus.
What can you do?

166
00:10:48,529 --> 00:10:51,054
At least he knows
what he's not looking for.

167
00:10:51,131 --> 00:10:54,225
It's learning not to be dependent
on other people for your happiness.

168
00:10:54,301 --> 00:10:58,397
That's what the therapy is for--
for people who give too much.

169
00:10:58,472 --> 00:11:01,066
It's not like C.A.
or A.A.

170
00:11:01,141 --> 00:11:04,269
It's for people who don't need that
in order to have relationships.

- You see, you have to learn--
- Look, Meryl? We gotta go.

You know, maybe his place,
maybe my place?

It's our first date.

I'm retaining water?

We really have to go.

to get this money?

Honey, your fairy
godmother's here.

You know I will pay you back
every cent, plus interest.

Are you crazy?
I'm not lending you money.

I'm not having a complete stranger

How do you think I met Todd? Or
Chandler, that Connecticut trash.

200

You didn't live with them,
you had sex with them.

Look. You need to
meet someone new.

If you don't like him, tell him
you're back with your boyfriend.

I don't wanna talk
about it.

I just thought you were supposed
to see Debbie, that's all.

- So, I'm moving to Manhattan.

That's what I want to do
with this play.

It'd be a great role
for you, Warren.

I figured Pino Zito,

616
00:34:43,348 --> 00:34:47,114
- you gotta be Italian, right?
- Sicilian.

617
00:34:47,185 --> 00:34:51,019
Oh, you're Sicilian.
It's a beautiful island.

618
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:54,525
Very beautiful.
Hot as hell too.

619
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:58,858
You Sicilian men--
you're very continental.

620
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:01,626
Oh, very continental.

621
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:04,828
Are you Mafia?

622
00:35:04,903 --> 00:35:06,837
I'm continental.

623
00:35:14,012 --> 00:35:16,480
When's your birthday?

624
00:35:16,548 --> 00:35:19,346
May the 1 0th.

625
00:35:19,417 --> 00:35:22,250
- Taurus.
- The bull.

626
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:25,915
Taurus men--
strong, spontaneous.

627
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:28,515
Intelligent conversation
stimulates you.

628
00:35:28,593 --> 00:35:31,585
Mmm. Definitely
stimulating.

629
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:37,731
Taurus: Stubborn, jealous,
hard-headed--

630
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:40,464
It's getting harder
right now.

631
00:35:40,538 --> 00:35:42,733
A man with a sense of humor.
I like that.

632
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:44,741
Oh, I'm a man.

633
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:48,802
Men play games.
I don't.

634
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:52,043
That's why
I only date women.

635
00:36:03,094 --> 00:36:05,858
Friday night
and it's the weekend

644
00:36:30,622 --> 00:36:32,556
Oh, yeah

645
00:36:32,624 --> 00:36:36,082
Can you feel it in the air
when the music's playing

646
00:36:36,161 --> 00:36:38,095
This is it,Joey.
Manhattan girls,

our own place.

We'll be getting laid
all the time.

649
00:36:42,167 --> 00:36:45,000
But I can't move out of my house.
My father would kill me.

650
00:36:45,069 --> 00:36:47,230
But that guy Warren
has a nice apartment.

651
00:36:47,305 --> 00:36:49,239
Only if it wasn't
for those fuckin' cats.

652
00:36:49,307 --> 00:36:51,935
I know. That last apartment
wasn't so bad.

653
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:54,308
You can take a shower
and cook dinner at the same time.

654
00:36:54,379 --> 00:36:56,506
She only wants
two months' security.

655

Yeah, but where you
gonna get the money?

They're open tomorrow.
What am I gonna do today?

657
00:37:08,526 --> 00:37:11,552
I'd let you stay at my house,
but my father-- you know how he is.

658
00:37:11,629 --> 00:37:16,623
- He don't like people.
- Yeah, I know.

Where you been?

00:37:55,707 --> 00:37:57,902
We just came back from
a pawn shop. It was closed.

671
00:37:57,976 --> 00:38:01,241
A porn shop, for what?
Frankie, I got videos in the car.

672
00:38:01,312 --> 00:38:03,246
Triple X, lesbian,
whatever you want.

673
00:38:03,314 --> 00:38:06,750
Pawn shop! A pawn shop!
Joey, are you coming with me?

674

Ma's upset.
Come back home with me.

-Joey!
- Frankie, I can't. It's too late.

676

I gotta go home.
It's getting late.

677
00:38:14,726 --> 00:38:16,660
Why don't you just come with us?
I'll sit in the back.

678
00:38:16,728 --> 00:38:19,253
I'm not going anywhere with
this snake. Are you coming with me?

Forget you.

What about the cats?

How long you been waiting?

682
00:38:31,075 --> 00:38:33,635
Long enough to bang this Jewish
broad in the building here.

683
00:38:33,711 --> 00:38:35,645
These chicks in the city,
they're crazy, huh?

684
00:38:35,713 --> 00:38:37,647

- Yeah.

No cash?

Your stuff is here.

Look, uh...

690
00:38:59,971 --> 00:39:02,405
I wanted to tell you
that I'm sorry...

691

if I acted stupid
and everything, you know?

692
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:08,506
I think
you're a cool guy,

693
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:11,913
and, you know,
I don't know what I was thinking.

you know, not right.

I have faith in you.
You'll grow out of it.

Grow out of what?

698
00:39:26,731 --> 00:39:29,427
You're bothered
that I'm gay.

699
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:32,025
Me?

700
00:39:32,103 --> 00:39:36,005
I've hung out with
gay people before.

701
00:39:36,074 --> 00:39:38,099
My friend Joey has a sister
who went to school...

702
00:39:38,176 --> 00:39:40,110
with someone
who was gay.

- It doesn't bother me.
- Progressive.

Yeah, you know,
that's what I'm thinking.

705
00:39:44,616 --> 00:39:47,244
Maybe I could-- Maybe I could
hang around temporarily maybe.

706
00:39:47,318 --> 00:39:49,252
- No, no, no.
-Just for the night.

707
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:52,255
Frankie, if the fag police
found out...

708
00:39:52,323 --> 00:39:55,622
I had a Guido in my apartment,
they would take away my tutu...

709
00:39:55,693 --> 00:39:58,093
- Guido?
- and ban me from the club.

710

- No.

No, the Bronx.

Hmm, the Bronx. How many
gold chains do you own?

715
00:40:12,777 --> 00:40:16,338
- A few. So?
- And who's your favorite actor?

716
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:22,342
De Niro's the better actor,
but I like Stallone.

717
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:25,878
- You are such a Guido!
- So, what's wrong with that?

718
00:40:25,957 --> 00:40:27,948
I've hung out
with Guidos before.

719
00:40:28,026 --> 00:40:32,895
My friend Terry has a sister who
works with someone who's a Guido.

he needs to work out first.

You haven't paid
your rent in five months.

734
00:41:17,208 --> 00:41:19,369
If he has the money,
the place is his.

735

Yeah, but you only
paid for 5 1 /2!

737

as soon as my brother gives me
the money for this ring.

Whose ring is that?

740

Mine. I was gonna hock it, but I'm
gonna give it back to my brother.

741
00:41:36,461 --> 00:41:39,123
What would your brother want
with an engagement ring?

742
00:41:39,197 --> 00:41:41,927
I don't care,
as long as he gives me back--

743

As long as he puts it

Yeah, and he said that

I love that play.

00:53:27,031 --> 00:53:30,831
I'd probably have to read it
from the beginning, you know?

928
00:53:30,901 --> 00:53:32,425
Mm-hmm.

929
00:53:32,503 --> 00:53:34,801
Hey, what do you say
I stick around a few days?

930
00:53:34,872 --> 00:53:37,238
Help you out with the play?
What do you think?

931
00:53:37,307 --> 00:53:39,673
I think you should be looking
for an apartment.

932

I have to speak
to my brother first.

933
00:53:41,779 --> 00:53:43,770
Why? What happened
with the ring?

934
00:53:46,650 --> 00:53:48,618
What did you do
with the ring?

935
00:53:51,321 --> 00:53:53,949
Forty dollars!
You gotta get your money back.

936
00:53:54,024 --> 00:53:55,958
I mean, go get it
from your brother.

937
00:53:56,026 --> 00:53:57,960
- Forget it.
- I'll talk to him.

938
00:53:58,028 --> 00:54:01,191
My brother washes out used condoms.
You're not getting money from him.

939
00:54:01,265 --> 00:54:04,428
That's disgusting.
Okay, all right.

Everything in me calls you. You know
exactly how to satisfy my desire.

When I close my eyes,
I feel your hands on my skin--

943
00:54:18,315 --> 00:54:21,807
- Line.
- No, Warren, that's not it.

944
00:54:21,885 --> 00:54:24,547
No, Frankie. When I say line,
you give me the next line.

I'm sorry.

It's this part I got
in this play, you know?

Remember, he's dancing with
that skinny chick in the diner.

He's doing that

They know he's a better dancer
than that. He's just acting.

He's a good fuckin' dancer.

What happened?
He's not feeling well.

1007

I can see that. But I have a show
to put on that's sold out.

Maybe it's for the best. Give you
some time to work on that dialogue.

You don't mind,

Of course he minds.

How long have you
known about this show?

Why didn't you
come to me first?

1043

I wanted to. But then we had
the fight and my hands were tied.

Do you love him,

putting up the money for the play.

But do I love him?

Oh. I thought, uh--

And besides, I told you,
it just hurts too much.

You're in love with him,

Okay. You know what?
I cannot do your play, okay?

He's been practicing with me.

He's not the queerest boy

He's a little butch,
that's all.

You really think
he can do it?

1068

I really think he can do it.
I could help him.

we could talk about us.
