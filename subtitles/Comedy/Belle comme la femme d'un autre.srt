3
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
"THE BEAUTY AND THE BEAST"

4
00:01:12,001 --> 00:01:14,710
- "Once upon a time there was a rich merchant,

5
00:01:14,876 --> 00:01:16,626
"a kind and brave man,

6
00:01:16,793 --> 00:01:18,668
"who, after the death of his beloved wife,

7
00:01:18,835 --> 00:01:22,126
"lived only for the happiness of his six children.

8
00:01:22,293 --> 00:01:24,210
"Three girls and three boys.

9
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:27,626
"They filled their home with their laughter and their bickering.

11
00:01:29,085 --> 00:01:30,710
Oh, I think we have a guest.

12
00:01:30,876 --> 00:01:33,501
- She also wants to listen to the story.

13
00:01:35,543 --> 00:01:38,585
- We are going to make a wish, but it has to be in silence,

14
00:01:38,751 --> 00:01:40,335
otherwise, it won’t come true.

15
00:01:43,668 --> 00:01:46,335
Have you made your wish?
- Yes!

16
00:01:46,501 --> 00:01:50,460
Then, one, two, three

17
00:02:00,585 --> 00:02:03,043
Okay ! Do you want to listen to the rest
of the story?

18
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:04,668
Yes!

19
00:02:07,793 --> 00:02:12,126
- "The merchant owned three ships, which
were the source of his fortune and pride.

20
00:02:12,293 --> 00:02:15,043
"Their names were :
The Mermaid, The Triton,

21
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:17,626
"and the biggest one was The Leviathan.

23
00:02:23,085 --> 00:02:26,001
"Their cargo was full of wonders as 
they were coming back from their journey,

24
00:02:26,168 --> 00:02:29,168
"when all of a sudden,
a storm broke out.

26
00:02:34,335 --> 00:02:37,126
"The ships were swept
by huge waves,

27
00:02:37,293 --> 00:02:41,210
"both the sails and the masts
were struck by lightning.

28
00:02:41,376 --> 00:02:44,126
"On the surface, where the cold
and the silence reigned,

29
00:02:44,293 --> 00:02:47,168
"the ocean sparkled
brilliantly.

30
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:50,793
"The armada and the treasures
sunk to the bottom of the sea,

31
00:02:51,001 --> 00:02:53,501
"devoured, forever lost.

35
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:09,918
"Ruined in one month,

36
00:03:10,126 --> 00:03:13,085
"The merchant and his children
decided to leave their house,

37
00:03:13,251 --> 00:03:15,751
"their friends, their habits,

38
00:03:16,501 --> 00:03:18,876
"everything that, until that moment, 
made their happiness.

39
00:03:36,251 --> 00:03:37,251
- I forbid you

40
00:03:37,376 --> 00:03:38,626
to take that!

41
00:03:45,043 --> 00:03:46,085
Go on, take it then!

42
00:03:46,251 --> 00:03:49,210
The most precious things,
we will take with us.

44
00:03:52,626 --> 00:03:54,626
Put that down immediately
or I will gouge your eyes out!

45
00:03:54,793 --> 00:03:56,835
Daddy,
do something!

46
00:04:00,668 --> 00:04:02,918
Evertyhing! Our jewels, 
our beds. They have taken everything!


47
00:04:03,126 --> 00:04:04,501
It’s the end, I want to die.

48
00:04:04,626 --> 00:04:07,210
Clotilde, please,
don’t call me Daddy in front of these men.

49
00:04:07,376 --> 00:04:09,501
And you, Anne,
stop talking about death.

50
00:04:10,085 --> 00:04:12,043
Oh! Oh, my heart

51
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:13,293
is not beating anymore!

52
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:15,418
Are you happy now?
Bye!

53
00:04:17,751 --> 00:04:20,793
Look Daddy, it’s a catastrophe!
What would become of us now?

54
00:04:22,335 --> 00:04:23,918
Where is Belle?

55
00:04:24,126 --> 00:04:26,501
Belle, Belle!
Everything is always about her.

57
00:04:34,793 --> 00:04:36,251
- Wake up.

58
00:04:40,043 --> 00:04:41,335
Maxime, come and help us.

59
00:04:42,543 --> 00:04:44,585
There. What do you have in here?

60
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:46,043
All my books.

61
00:04:46,918 --> 00:04:50,626
My notebooks, my sketchs,
I wasn’t just going to leave them here.

62
00:04:51,418 --> 00:04:52,793
Tristan.

63
00:04:53,335 --> 00:04:56,043
What is it?
Take good care of your father.

64
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:59,585
Don’t let Maxime waste
the little money you still have left.

65
00:04:59,751 --> 00:05:02,376
Of course, don’t worry. I promise.

66
00:05:02,501 --> 00:05:04,335
Everything is going to be fine.

67
00:05:04,501 --> 00:05:05,918
Pay attention.

69
00:05:15,376 --> 00:05:18,210
I want to punch
all those who laugh at us.

70
00:05:18,376 --> 00:05:19,418
Ignore them!

71
00:05:19,543 --> 00:05:20,543
So, tell me,

72
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:24,418
do you want to have some action
before we bury ourself in the countryside?

73
00:05:25,001 --> 00:05:27,418
It’s not a bad idea for you to disappear 
for a while, you know!

74
00:05:27,751 --> 00:05:28,876
Don’t you think so?

75
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:31,710
Belle?

76
00:05:36,918 --> 00:05:37,918
Belle?

77
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:53,126
Here you have, mom.

78
00:05:53,293 --> 00:05:55,501
It’s a new life
that is about to start.

79
00:05:55,626 --> 00:05:57,251
I believe I am ready for it.

80
00:06:05,751 --> 00:06:08,293
Do you think she would have loved
living in the countryside ?

81
00:06:09,501 --> 00:06:10,501
She would have loved it.

82
00:06:11,418 --> 00:06:12,876
- Me too, I’m going to love it.

83
00:06:13,668 --> 00:06:14,835
I am sure of that.

84
00:06:15,043 --> 00:06:18,793
It’s obvious! We are proud and
courageous in this family.

85
00:06:21,376 --> 00:06:24,710
We are going to support each other
as we always have.

90
00:06:52,001 --> 00:06:53,293
"They needed some time

91
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:55,335
"to get used to their new life.

92
00:06:55,501 --> 00:06:58,168
"The first nights,
Belle stayed awake in her room

93
00:06:58,335 --> 00:07:00,626
listening to the noises of the countryside”

94
00:07:00,793 --> 00:07:03,126
"Then, aided by her brothers,

95
00:07:03,293 --> 00:07:05,460
she decided to fix the garden.

96
00:07:05,585 --> 00:07:08,418
She turned their home into a beautiful haven”

97
00:07:08,793 --> 00:07:10,460
I have a fever.

98
00:07:11,501 --> 00:07:13,001
I have a wrinkle!

99
00:07:14,335 --> 00:07:16,460
And these bugs are pissing me off!

100
00:07:25,793 --> 00:07:27,668
It’s been a month since we started
living in this hell.

101
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:31,251
We are going to die alone, wrinkled,

102
00:07:31,418 --> 00:07:33,460
devoured by the beasts.

103
00:07:33,585 --> 00:07:35,751
- Anne, Clotilde, come down.

104
00:07:37,251 --> 00:07:40,085
Oh, not her!
Her happiness disgusts me.

105
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:41,501
I want to drown her in a well.

106
00:07:41,626 --> 00:07:44,501
And me, I want to bury her alive in 
her garden.

107
00:07:44,668 --> 00:07:47,460
- What are you doing?

108
00:07:50,168 --> 00:07:52,210
Clotilde is not feeling well so
we will have breakfast in bed.

109
00:07:52,376 --> 00:07:53,376
You will certainly not!

110
00:07:53,501 --> 00:07:55,918
And after breakfast,
we will all take care of the garden.

111
00:07:56,626 --> 00:07:57,626
I would rather die instead.

112
00:07:58,043 --> 00:07:59,835
Let’s go!
Everyone, downstairs now!

114
00:08:09,501 --> 00:08:11,835
- "Defeated,

115
00:08:14,793 --> 00:08:16,835
"pierced by arrows,

116
00:08:17,668 --> 00:08:20,043
"the young man left
the battefield

117
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:22,043
"and took shelter in the forest."

118
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:24,168
Oh, oh!

119
00:08:24,335 --> 00:08:26,126
Hou, hou!

120
00:08:26,918 --> 00:08:28,501
Oh, oh!

121
00:08:31,251 --> 00:08:32,835
Ah, we could say everyone at the Maritime Affairs

122
00:08:33,043 --> 00:08:35,751
were happy to see me.
Dumont was charming.

123
00:08:36,793 --> 00:08:38,376
It seems his eldest daughter 
has married a count.

124
00:08:38,501 --> 00:08:39,501
What?

125
00:08:39,585 --> 00:08:40,585
Ah No!

126
00:08:40,626 --> 00:08:42,460
But the biggest news

127
00:08:42,585 --> 00:08:43,710
is that The Mermaid,

128
00:08:43,876 --> 00:08:46,001
your mother’s favorite ship,

129
00:08:47,168 --> 00:08:48,626
has been found.

130
00:08:49,335 --> 00:08:53,001
They founf it drifting on the shoreline
and they brought it to the port.

131
00:08:53,168 --> 00:08:55,543
And the merchandise?
Undamaged!

132
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:57,210
My children, I think we are saved.

133
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:00,626
Let’s get our suitcases ready.
Better not.

134
00:09:00,793 --> 00:09:03,710
We will throw everything to the fire.
Blood is pumping through my body.

135
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:05,710
I come back to life, Daddy.
I have been reborn.

136
00:09:06,376 --> 00:09:08,043
- We can’t go back
to the city in our present state.

137
00:09:08,876 --> 00:09:12,543
Of course not, we need new dresees,
perfume, and … what else?

138
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:15,501
We will make a list
Ah yes. For our happiness in the city!

139
00:09:15,668 --> 00:09:17,043
The city, the real one.

140
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:19,501
You will come with me to the city.

141
00:09:19,668 --> 00:09:22,668
I think it’s time I introduce
my successor to Dumont.

142
00:09:23,418 --> 00:09:25,376
I will not disappoint you, father. 
Thank you!

143
00:09:25,501 --> 00:09:27,668
- "And, after defeating 
the last of his enemies,

144
00:09:28,585 --> 00:09:31,626
"the young men returned 
to his lands, triumphant,

145
00:09:31,793 --> 00:09:33,668
"acclaimed by his people."

146
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:35,251
Period.

147
00:09:36,376 --> 00:09:38,085
A new novel, brother?

148
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:41,460
- Even better.
This one will be a master piece.

149
00:09:55,168 --> 00:09:57,001
What are you up to?

150
00:09:58,210 --> 00:09:59,418
Are you sulking?

151
00:10:00,585 --> 00:10:01,585
Obviously.

152
00:10:01,668 --> 00:10:04,126
When a girl is sad,
people say she is sulking.

153
00:10:04,293 --> 00:10:07,168
And when she is joyful,
people say she is crazy

154
00:10:07,335 --> 00:10:11,418
How do you want us to understand you?
Everyone is happy but you.

155
00:10:16,293 --> 00:10:18,793
I would have loved
to stay here longer.

156
00:10:19,001 --> 00:10:20,001
That is all!

157
00:10:20,043 --> 00:10:21,501
He is there.

158
00:10:22,793 --> 00:10:25,793
We came to live here
to hide our misfourtune.

159
00:10:26,001 --> 00:10:27,501
We don’t belong here.

160
00:10:27,626 --> 00:10:29,626
You know, as well as I do,
what is going to happen.

161
00:10:29,793 --> 00:10:32,543
Maxime will meet again with 
those thugs he calls friends.

162
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:35,876
Anne and Clotilde will go out every afternoon
in hopes of finding a husband.

163
00:10:36,626 --> 00:10:39,376
And you, you will always
be busy with work.

164
00:10:39,501 --> 00:10:41,626
Belle, one day or another, we will
all follow different paths.

165
00:10:41,793 --> 00:10:44,585
Even you, you will grow
and will want to leave.

166
00:10:44,751 --> 00:10:46,043
But that doesn’t mean

167
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:48,585
we will stop loving each other;
it will just mean you’ve become a woman.

168
00:10:50,501 --> 00:10:51,501
Above all, don’t forget anything.

169
00:10:51,835 --> 00:10:53,210
Clotilde wouldn’t take it well.

170
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:01,543
And you, what should I bring you?

171
00:11:02,543 --> 00:11:04,126
I would like just a rose.

172
00:11:04,751 --> 00:11:06,876
I could never make them
grow here.

176
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:38,168
- They have taken everything from me!

177
00:11:38,335 --> 00:11:41,293
They wouldn’t even allow me
to board my own ship.

178
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:43,460
You must have a reason to do so.

179
00:11:43,585 --> 00:11:46,126
The Mermaid and its cargo

180
00:11:46,293 --> 00:11:48,085
don’t belong to you anymore.

181
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:52,210
They treat me as if I were
less than nothing,

182
00:11:52,376 --> 00:11:55,293
But without me, this place would
still be just another port of fishermen.

183
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:56,585
And you just let them do this to me?

184
00:11:56,751 --> 00:11:59,876
You lacked common sense,
my poor friend.

185
00:12:00,501 --> 00:12:03,126
You signed all the
debt letters,

186
00:12:03,751 --> 00:12:05,835
when I had already warned you.

187
00:12:08,168 --> 00:12:10,293
Do not look down on me, Dumont.

188
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:12,918
Without me, you wouldn’t
be sitting behind that desk.

189
00:12:13,126 --> 00:12:17,543
Have you also lost your elegance,
alongside your fortune?

190
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:20,501
I’m going to crack you skull open!
Stop that inmediately!

191
00:12:22,876 --> 00:12:24,460
Do you not understand?

192
00:12:25,126 --> 00:12:27,126
You no longer have any power.

193
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:29,751
You pretend you are rich,

194
00:12:29,918 --> 00:12:31,668
but you are a nobody now.

195
00:12:34,418 --> 00:12:36,085
I pity you, father!

196
00:12:43,835 --> 00:12:44,835
Maxime!

197
00:13:02,835 --> 00:13:04,751
- I see a man.

198
00:13:04,918 --> 00:13:07,543
You don’t have to let him get away.

199
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:10,168
He brings important news.

200
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:14,668
- News? Good and bad ones?

201
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:17,543
You know very well that it depends
on the other cards.

202
00:13:20,168 --> 00:13:23,418
Are you not in the mood
of pleasing me, Astrid?

203
00:13:23,918 --> 00:13:26,293
Predict something
exciting for me!

204
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:28,085
- I am like the cards, love,

205
00:13:28,251 --> 00:13:30,210
I can’t lie to you.

206
00:13:30,876 --> 00:13:31,876
Did I not warn you

207
00:13:32,001 --> 00:13:33,626
about your scar?

208
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:52,043
A torrent of gold
under an emerald moon.

209
00:13:52,793 --> 00:13:54,668
Fate smiles upon you.

210
00:13:55,477 --> 00:13:56,477
Gold?

211
00:13:56,501 --> 00:13:57,710
Emeralds?

212
00:13:58,835 --> 00:14:00,501
Cheer up, my lousy friends!

213
00:14:02,293 --> 00:14:04,876
Haven’t I told you
we were going to become rich?

214
00:14:05,085 --> 00:14:08,126
Damn night.
I can feel the dust.

215
00:14:08,293 --> 00:14:09,376
What will you drink?

216
00:14:10,085 --> 00:14:12,835
I’m looking for my son.
I know he comes here often.

217
00:14:13,043 --> 00:14:14,543
A regular customer of this slum?

218
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:16,751
Then I feel sorry for you.

219
00:14:16,918 --> 00:14:18,626
What is your son’s name?

220
00:14:18,793 --> 00:14:20,251
Maxime de Beauffremont.

222
00:14:25,543 --> 00:14:27,585
You should have spoken lower.

223
00:14:27,751 --> 00:14:30,418
I’m going to have to ask you to leave
through the backdoor.

224
00:14:30,543 --> 00:14:33,418
I need to find my son.
Ah, you are not the only one!

225
00:14:39,501 --> 00:14:41,543
Come behind the counter. Go!

227
00:14:48,668 --> 00:14:50,210
Your scent,

228
00:14:53,085 --> 00:14:55,168
your predictions,

229
00:14:57,543 --> 00:15:00,043
you have too much power over me.

230
00:15:06,085 --> 00:15:08,001
Monsieur de Beauffremont.

231
00:15:09,293 --> 00:15:12,293
It’s been months since
I have been looking for Maxime.

232
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:14,251
And I ran into his old father.

233
00:15:15,001 --> 00:15:16,793
I don’t know you.

234
00:15:17,001 --> 00:15:19,376
You are...?
Perducas.

235
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:21,835
At your service.

236
00:15:29,126 --> 00:15:31,543
Your son ows me
a large sum of money.

237
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:33,918
so, you and me, we are going
to settle this.

238
00:15:34,126 --> 00:15:35,460
And everything will be forgiven.

239
00:15:35,585 --> 00:15:37,710
My son doesn’t hang out with scoundrels.

240
00:15:38,835 --> 00:15:41,293
Serve them a drink,
so that they leave me alone !

241
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:43,585
He thinks we are beggars.

242
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:48,460
- You can’t do this here, Perducas.

243
00:15:49,335 --> 00:15:50,710
You know it.

244
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:54,585
Let the good man alone.

245
00:16:02,043 --> 00:16:03,335
Okay.

246
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:12,043
Move back. And you,

247
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:14,501
come behind the counter now.

248
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:17,585
Come on, let’s go.

249
00:16:19,043 --> 00:16:21,501
You should keep your courage,
because now he won’t let it go.

250
00:16:21,668 --> 00:16:23,418
Go away. Now!

254
00:17:19,793 --> 00:17:21,835
- "On his way back,

255
00:17:22,043 --> 00:17:26,085
“the merchant fought against the wind,
the cold and the sadness.

256
00:17:26,585 --> 00:17:29,085
"He had escaped the city without Maxime.

257
00:17:29,251 --> 00:17:32,293
"He imagined him wandering
through the dregs of society or worst,

258
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:35,085
“dumped in an alley, lifeless.

259
00:17:36,418 --> 00:17:38,585
“He pulled the reins of his horse,

260
00:17:38,751 --> 00:17:40,835
“expecting to come back 
home sonner,

261
00:17:41,043 --> 00:17:42,710
"where his son would be waiting for him."

267
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:47,210
I don’t even have a weapon
to finish you off

268
00:18:52,376 --> 00:18:53,751
Forgive me.

271
00:19:32,335 --> 00:19:33,668
The house!

272
00:19:34,501 --> 00:19:35,793
I found it!

273
00:19:37,835 --> 00:19:39,543
No, this is not the house.

279
00:21:06,668 --> 00:21:08,460
Is there somebody here?

281
00:21:21,835 --> 00:21:23,876
I am lost.

282
00:21:27,043 --> 00:21:29,085
And it was open.

287
00:22:05,835 --> 00:22:07,376
Who is there?

290
00:22:38,335 --> 00:22:39,543
I must be dreaming...

291
00:22:42,501 --> 00:22:44,460
or I died and 
I am in paradise.

292
00:22:47,835 --> 00:22:49,751
No, I am certain I am alive.

293
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:51,835
And I am hungry.

294
00:23:03,501 --> 00:23:06,418
I’m going to take some things
from the table.

295
00:23:06,543 --> 00:23:07,585
Eh?

298
00:23:36,085 --> 00:23:37,460
Scoundrel!

304
00:24:24,376 --> 00:24:25,376
The dresses,

305
00:24:28,626 --> 00:24:30,085
the shawls,

306
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:32,793
the make-up.

307
00:24:33,668 --> 00:24:35,710
Incredible! Everything is here.

308
00:24:38,501 --> 00:24:40,210
Well, almost everything.

310
00:24:54,876 --> 00:24:57,168
But, who took care of your wound?

314
00:26:32,626 --> 00:26:34,376
Aren’t my gifts enough for you?

315
00:26:34,501 --> 00:26:37,335
You have to also steal that which is 
most sacred for me?

317
00:26:41,293 --> 00:26:44,626
I would not let anybody
treat me as a thief or a coward.

318
00:26:45,501 --> 00:26:48,001
I am a righteous and virtuous man.

319
00:26:48,168 --> 00:26:50,501
-For whom have you picked this rose?

320
00:26:53,001 --> 00:26:55,085
It is for the youngest of my daughters.

321
00:26:56,085 --> 00:26:57,926
She is my most precious
thing in the world.

322
00:26:58,126 --> 00:27:01,501
Then, I give you one day
to say goodbye to those you love.

323
00:27:02,585 --> 00:27:04,710
You will just have to whisper:

324
00:27:05,335 --> 00:27:06,751
"More than anything in the world"

325
00:27:07,376 --> 00:27:10,710
in the ear of your horse
so that he brings you to me.

326
00:27:12,918 --> 00:27:14,460
I will not come back.

327
00:27:14,585 --> 00:27:16,751
Oh yes, you will come back.

328
00:27:16,918 --> 00:27:19,335
Otherwise, I will kill
all the members of your family

329
00:27:19,501 --> 00:27:20,543
one after another

330
00:27:22,043 --> 00:27:25,418
I will leave the youngest of your daughters 
for last because she is your favorite

331
00:27:28,376 --> 00:27:29,876
Remember,

332
00:27:30,668 --> 00:27:32,001
a life

333
00:27:32,668 --> 00:27:34,460
for a rose.

335
00:27:54,501 --> 00:27:55,501
- There !
- Yeah, it’s him!

336
00:27:55,626 --> 00:27:56,793
- There, I see him.

337
00:27:58,001 --> 00:27:59,001
- Father!

338
00:27:59,686 --> 00:28:00,686
- Father!

339
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:02,085
Father!

340
00:28:02,251 --> 00:28:03,335
Father!

341
00:28:14,876 --> 00:28:17,460
This story about a beast and a rose
makes no sense.

342
00:28:17,585 --> 00:28:19,001
-Then, how do you explain this?

343
00:28:19,168 --> 00:28:20,835
You can see it is real.

344
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:24,085
"More than anything in the world."

345
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:27,085
And your horse is supposed to find the road 
to this castle magically?

346
00:28:28,043 --> 00:28:30,168
It’s our fault.
Everything is our fault.

347
00:28:30,335 --> 00:28:32,043
It is not for you he picked up that flower.

348
00:28:32,585 --> 00:28:34,626
It is not anyone’s fault!
Shut up!

349
00:28:35,793 --> 00:28:36,918
I can not explain to you

350
00:28:37,126 --> 00:28:38,793
who that beast is.

351
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:41,501
But, for having stolen this rose,

352
00:28:42,501 --> 00:28:45,085
I must come back there
in a few hours.

353
00:28:48,085 --> 00:28:49,710
What is he going to do to you?

354
00:28:49,876 --> 00:28:51,460
- I don’t know, Tristan.

355
00:28:52,501 --> 00:28:55,418
He said : "A life for a rose."

356
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:00,376
- And if you don’t do what he asks of you?

357
00:29:01,626 --> 00:29:03,876
Then we will all die.

359
00:29:28,835 --> 00:29:30,293
Don’t say anything.

360
00:29:31,043 --> 00:29:33,168
I know what everyone thinks.

361
00:29:33,793 --> 00:29:35,918
They all think mom died
giving birth to me.

362
00:29:37,001 --> 00:29:39,460
I don’t know what you are 
talking about.

363
00:29:40,918 --> 00:29:43,626
I will not be responsible 
for your death too.

364
00:29:51,085 --> 00:29:53,126
- Belle! Belle!

365
00:29:53,751 --> 00:29:55,126
Belle!

366
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:58,251
Don’t forget to love me!

367
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:03,210
- Belle! Belle! Belle!

368
00:30:03,376 --> 00:30:04,418
Belle!

369
00:30:07,251 --> 00:30:08,460
Belle.

370
00:30:08,585 --> 00:30:10,043
No, father.

373
00:30:30,751 --> 00:30:32,751
Guide me to the castle,

374
00:30:32,918 --> 00:30:34,793
and take me to that beast.

375
00:30:36,043 --> 00:30:38,001
“More than anything in the world”.

382
00:33:27,251 --> 00:33:29,668
- A life for a rose.

385
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:05,501
- "Belle was already ready to die

386
00:35:05,626 --> 00:35:08,335
"when the first bells rang.

387
00:35:09,418 --> 00:35:12,710
"As she started discovering
the castle of the Beast,

388
00:35:12,876 --> 00:35:16,251
"a noise, stronger,
headier than the bell,

389
00:35:16,418 --> 00:35:18,668
"resonated in her whole being:

390
00:35:19,626 --> 00:35:21,501
"her heartbeats."

394
00:35:57,293 --> 00:35:59,001
My name is Belle.

395
00:35:59,585 --> 00:36:02,626
I came here to exchange my life
for that of my father.

396
00:36:06,001 --> 00:36:07,001
Sit down.

398
00:36:40,126 --> 00:36:41,585
Eat.

399
00:36:43,335 --> 00:36:45,460
When you have regained your strength,

400
00:36:45,585 --> 00:36:48,876
you will be able to go for a walk
wherever you like in my properties.

401
00:36:49,793 --> 00:36:53,835
But, at night,
I forbid you to leave the castle.

402
00:36:54,751 --> 00:36:56,626
If I should die,

403
00:36:56,793 --> 00:36:58,543
I prefer to die right now.

404
00:37:00,210 --> 00:37:02,376
- You are more courageous than
your father.

405
00:37:03,626 --> 00:37:05,710
Every evening,
at this same hour,

406
00:37:06,918 --> 00:37:08,501
You must be here.

407
00:37:09,126 --> 00:37:11,251
Do not think about running away.

408
00:37:11,918 --> 00:37:14,876
The forest will close in on you.

411
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:31,210
Do you want me to stop?
- No, I want to hear the rest.

412
00:37:32,418 --> 00:37:33,501
What makes me sad

413
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:36,126
is that she is all alone,
the poor little thing.

414
00:37:36,585 --> 00:37:38,751
It’s true.
She felt really lonely.

415
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:41,668
“As she went up
the enormous staircase,

416
00:37:41,835 --> 00:37:43,793
"Belle realized than no even once,

417
00:37:44,001 --> 00:37:45,501
"in her entire life,

418
00:37:45,626 --> 00:37:48,043
"had she spent one night
away from her loved ones.

419
00:37:48,793 --> 00:37:50,168
"But, what she didn’t know

420
00:37:50,335 --> 00:37:53,626
"was that in her room,
the Tadums were waiting for her,

421
00:37:53,793 --> 00:37:56,168
"small creatures
that inhabited the castle,

422
00:37:56,335 --> 00:37:59,126
"who would become
her best friends.”

431
00:39:29,835 --> 00:39:31,210
- Sleep.

432
00:39:31,376 --> 00:39:32,585
Dream.

433
00:39:35,251 --> 00:39:36,501
Come.

435
00:39:41,043 --> 00:39:42,043
Come.

436
00:39:42,210 --> 00:39:45,210
Get me closer to the mirror where 
nothing ever fades.

437
00:39:46,876 --> 00:39:48,168
Come.

438
00:40:11,293 --> 00:40:13,335
The source of memories.

440
00:40:34,210 --> 00:40:38,126
Here they come ! They will shout, they will be dirty and
excited. They piss me off already!

441
00:40:38,293 --> 00:40:41,376
The one who will conquer your heart
may be among them.

442
00:40:41,501 --> 00:40:44,460
Then I will give him hell.

443
00:40:48,168 --> 00:40:49,543
Here they are !

447
00:41:18,168 --> 00:41:19,585
I always knew you were unfaithful to me.

448
00:41:21,668 --> 00:41:23,001
Now, I’m going to eat you.

450
00:41:36,251 --> 00:41:38,085
Get your dirty hands off her.

451
00:41:38,835 --> 00:41:40,043
- Yes, my friend.

452
00:41:40,210 --> 00:41:42,501
No doe, no reward.

453
00:41:44,043 --> 00:41:46,001
You still haven’t given up?

454
00:41:46,168 --> 00:41:47,460
For years it has eluded me,

455
00:41:47,585 --> 00:41:49,335
but I will have it. I can feel it.

456
00:41:49,501 --> 00:41:51,376
It will be my most beautiful trophy...

457
00:41:53,126 --> 00:41:54,168
besides you of course.

458
00:41:56,626 --> 00:41:57,835
Look what they gave to him.

459
00:41:58,043 --> 00:42:00,376
All golden,
like the fur of that doe.

460
00:42:02,436 --> 00:42:03,436
Let’s go!

461
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:04,751
I am thirsty.

462
00:42:04,918 --> 00:42:06,585
We need to drink.

463
00:42:07,210 --> 00:42:08,210
Come.

465
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:28,501
He could have stayed home with me.

466
00:42:29,710 --> 00:42:31,168
I’ve had enough.

467
00:42:50,043 --> 00:42:51,668
You stink of sweat.

468
00:43:10,251 --> 00:43:11,251
My love,

469
00:43:12,126 --> 00:43:13,668
I want to ask something of you.

470
00:43:13,835 --> 00:43:14,918
Something of me?

471
00:43:15,835 --> 00:43:18,251
I want you to give up on that doe!

472
00:43:26,019 --> 00:43:27,019
But why?

473
00:43:27,043 --> 00:43:30,501
I am tired of you leaving
for days and days to hunt it.

474
00:43:32,501 --> 00:43:35,293
I feel terribly lonely in here

475
00:43:35,918 --> 00:43:37,418
without you.

476
00:43:40,126 --> 00:43:41,376
Okay.

477
00:43:42,710 --> 00:43:44,793
But I have one condition.

478
00:43:46,168 --> 00:43:47,668
Give me a son.

481
00:44:24,251 --> 00:44:27,251
- "Belle hesitated for a long time before
deciding to leave her room,

482
00:44:27,418 --> 00:44:30,293
"because she feared the Beast
will appear out of a dark corner.

483
00:44:30,876 --> 00:44:34,251
"But her curiosity
was stronger than her fear.

484
00:44:34,418 --> 00:44:36,501
"She wanted to explore the surroundings,

485
00:44:36,668 --> 00:44:39,335
"to see the immensity of her prison.

494
00:46:49,126 --> 00:46:50,626
The princess!

495
00:46:52,001 --> 00:46:54,918
- "Then Belle understood 
that years,

496
00:46:55,126 --> 00:46:57,793
"or centuries ago,
another woman had lived,

497
00:46:58,001 --> 00:46:59,668
"had known love and had died

498
00:46:59,835 --> 00:47:01,501
"in that cursed castle.

499
00:47:01,626 --> 00:47:04,418
"Why me?",
She sadly asked the statue.

500
00:47:04,543 --> 00:47:06,543
"Why do you trouble my sleep at night?"

501
00:47:06,710 --> 00:47:07,918
"Filled with melancholy,

502
00:47:08,126 --> 00:47:09,835
"Belle ran to his room,
seeking sanctuary,

503
00:47:10,043 --> 00:47:13,126
"waiting for the bells to announce
her daily meeting

504
00:47:13,293 --> 00:47:14,626
"with her strange prison guard.”

505
00:47:16,668 --> 00:47:18,251
You are late.

506
00:47:23,501 --> 00:47:25,168
Do you like your new dress?

507
00:47:25,710 --> 00:47:27,668
Don’t ever come to 
my room again.

508
00:47:28,210 --> 00:47:30,293
- Do I need to remind you
that I have every right to do so?

509
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:32,001
We will see about that.

510
00:47:35,626 --> 00:47:38,085
Don’t look at me.
Eat.

511
00:47:39,043 --> 00:47:40,251
Aren’t you going to eat too?

512
00:47:40,418 --> 00:47:42,793
- No, not in front of you.

513
00:47:43,001 --> 00:47:46,418
Can I talk or should I eat my dinner
in silence, like a child?

514
00:47:46,543 --> 00:47:48,001
- Yet, that is what you are,

515
00:47:48,168 --> 00:47:50,043
an arrogant child.

516
00:47:50,210 --> 00:47:53,835
I like people to think I am
childish and futile…

517
00:47:54,043 --> 00:47:55,376
And you talk too much!

518
00:48:03,585 --> 00:48:04,585
I know you are pleased that

519
00:48:04,710 --> 00:48:07,043
I furnish the emptiness of 
this castle.

520
00:48:08,168 --> 00:48:09,501
Who owns this castle?

521
00:48:09,626 --> 00:48:11,418
- Everything here belongs to me.

522
00:48:12,335 --> 00:48:14,585
You talk
like an ordinary man.

523
00:48:14,751 --> 00:48:16,085
It’s very disappointing.

524
00:48:20,168 --> 00:48:22,168
Do I really disappoint you that much?

525
00:48:23,751 --> 00:48:26,501
Is there something else
about me that displeases you?

526
00:48:31,460 --> 00:48:33,376
Why are you talking anymore?

527
00:48:33,501 --> 00:48:36,460
Day and night, I wait for 
you to decide my fate.

528
00:48:37,001 --> 00:48:39,043
You play with me as if I were a mouse
between your paws.

529
00:48:39,793 --> 00:48:42,126
If you accept to surrender yourself to me,

530
00:48:43,001 --> 00:48:44,585
I could fulfill all your wishes.

531
00:48:44,751 --> 00:48:46,335
Do you really think 
a beast like you

532
00:48:46,501 --> 00:48:48,751
could satisfy
a woman like me?

534
00:48:53,043 --> 00:48:54,126
Lower your eyes.

535
00:48:54,293 --> 00:48:55,751
Lower your eyes!

536
00:48:56,335 --> 00:48:57,876
I know what I am.

537
00:48:58,543 --> 00:49:00,626
Resist me all you want.

538
00:49:01,710 --> 00:49:03,335
You will be mine.

540
00:49:34,876 --> 00:49:36,835
"Eat, don’t look at me.

541
00:49:37,043 --> 00:49:38,876
"Do this, don’t do that."

542
00:49:39,085 --> 00:49:42,126
I will show that animal
some manners.

544
00:50:01,751 --> 00:50:03,793
What is this?

545
00:50:05,710 --> 00:50:07,335
Ah, but it’s me!

546
00:50:08,751 --> 00:50:10,376
It’s the spitting image of me.

547
00:50:10,876 --> 00:50:12,335
What a wonderful gift.

549
00:50:22,001 --> 00:50:24,918
I wonder who could have
made this beautiful doll?

550
00:50:31,501 --> 00:50:32,585
Where are you hiding?

551
00:50:33,543 --> 00:50:35,585
Show yourself to me.
I’m not going to eat you.

553
00:50:44,543 --> 00:50:46,043
I will leave it here.

554
00:50:46,210 --> 00:50:48,043
Like this, il will always be close to me.

558
00:51:17,876 --> 00:51:19,585
- Hapy days

559
00:51:26,626 --> 00:51:28,501
that erase the past.

560
00:51:29,293 --> 00:51:30,501
Dream.

561
00:51:31,918 --> 00:51:33,793
Listen to our song

562
00:51:34,668 --> 00:51:36,626
that leads to the mirror.

563
00:51:38,585 --> 00:51:41,751
Look at the fiancé who became 
an animal.

564
00:51:42,335 --> 00:51:44,001
Dream, dream.

565
00:51:57,293 --> 00:51:58,793
My friends,

566
00:51:59,626 --> 00:52:01,668
today is a great day.

567
00:52:02,751 --> 00:52:05,335
Our kingdom
Will finally have an heir.

570
00:52:14,543 --> 00:52:16,251
What about you, my lady?

571
00:52:16,418 --> 00:52:19,001
What would you say about
me making you a little heir?

572
00:52:19,168 --> 00:52:21,710
- First, you would need
to have a kingdom.

573
00:52:21,876 --> 00:52:24,501
Let’s pray to the heavens
that he wouldn’t get your brains.

574
00:52:29,501 --> 00:52:31,168
What are you thinking about?

575
00:52:32,085 --> 00:52:34,085
The first time I met you,

576
00:52:34,251 --> 00:52:35,501
in the river.

577
00:52:37,418 --> 00:52:41,085
You got close to the shoreline 
and started undressing.

578
00:52:44,168 --> 00:52:45,751
You were drowning.

579
00:52:47,710 --> 00:52:49,460
I swin better than you.

580
00:52:54,876 --> 00:52:57,376
What if we come back
to our bedroom?

581
00:53:00,251 --> 00:53:02,335
And you, don’t you dare forget about your promise!

582
00:53:04,335 --> 00:53:05,626
Which one?

583
00:53:07,751 --> 00:53:09,126
The golden doe.

586
00:53:29,543 --> 00:53:31,835
Let love blossom.

587
00:53:34,543 --> 00:53:36,751
Dream, dream.

588
00:53:36,918 --> 00:53:38,085
Dream.

589
00:53:41,168 --> 00:53:44,251
We are the fireflies.

590
00:53:46,043 --> 00:53:49,501
- "After waking up,
Belle went to explore the castle,

591
00:53:49,626 --> 00:53:52,543
"determined to discover
the misteries of the Beast.

592
00:53:53,668 --> 00:53:57,543
"She got lost in a laberynth
of corridors and run down footbridges.

593
00:53:57,710 --> 00:54:01,918
"She always had the strange
feeling of being followed.

602
00:56:16,335 --> 00:56:18,876
I ask you to forgive me
about last night.

603
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:21,501
You were right.

604
00:56:22,751 --> 00:56:25,043
You fill an unbearable void.

605
00:56:27,668 --> 00:56:29,585
Do you like my gifts?

606
00:56:31,918 --> 00:56:33,210
Why don’t you answer?

607
00:56:33,876 --> 00:56:35,418
I miss my family.

608
00:56:37,085 --> 00:56:38,168
- Forget about them.

609
00:56:38,335 --> 00:56:39,835
They no longer exist for you.

610
00:56:40,501 --> 00:56:42,335
Maybe not thinking about the
past is easy for you.

611
00:56:42,501 --> 00:56:46,001
But I haven’t given it up yet. 
What do you know about me? Nothing!

612
00:56:46,168 --> 00:56:47,376
Nothing.

613
00:56:49,043 --> 00:56:50,501
You are right.

614
00:56:52,293 --> 00:56:54,126
I propose a deal.

615
00:56:55,751 --> 00:56:57,793
A few hours with my family...

616
00:56:59,418 --> 00:57:00,918
- In exchange of what?

617
00:57:02,168 --> 00:57:03,168
A dance.

618
00:57:06,418 --> 00:57:08,418
In exchange,
you will let me see them.

619
00:57:08,543 --> 00:57:10,293
You are giving me scraps of your attention.

620
00:57:11,251 --> 00:57:13,793
- I will lead you
if this scares you that much.

623
00:58:23,501 --> 00:58:25,501
Dancing with me doesn’t scare you?

624
00:58:27,710 --> 00:58:29,168
Let yourself go.

626
00:59:59,876 --> 01:00:01,793
Do you want to love me?

627
01:00:06,168 --> 01:00:08,335
We had a deal.

628
01:00:08,501 --> 01:00:10,043
Keep your promise.

629
01:00:10,210 --> 01:00:13,626
It’s been a long time
since I promised anything to anyone.

630
01:00:16,126 --> 01:00:19,876
You dress in the jewels of a prince.
You think you are a man.

631
01:00:21,126 --> 01:00:24,043
But you are nothing
more than a cruel and lonely beast.

632
01:00:24,210 --> 01:00:27,835
You can try it all: you can even blackmail me, 
but I won’t stop being disgusted by you.

645
01:03:29,918 --> 01:03:32,335
Now,
you know what I am.

646
01:03:33,543 --> 01:03:35,751
Tell me again that
you are disgusted by me.

647
01:03:35,918 --> 01:03:37,251
Say it to me.

651
01:04:36,168 --> 01:04:39,376
I give you permission to see
your family one last time.

652
01:04:40,543 --> 01:04:41,710
For real?

653
01:04:42,626 --> 01:04:44,043
Are you sure you aren’t just saying 
this to torture me?

654
01:04:47,126 --> 01:04:48,835
I give you one day.

655
01:04:49,793 --> 01:04:50,793
Nothing more than that.

656
01:04:51,543 --> 01:04:53,376
You will leave at dawn.

658
01:05:24,085 --> 01:05:25,335
Give me your hand.

659
01:05:25,501 --> 01:05:26,835
Which one?

660
01:05:27,043 --> 01:05:29,335
I don’t know.
It doesn’t matter, the left one.

661
01:05:30,126 --> 01:05:31,585
Don’t tell me you’re you going give me a ring?

662
01:05:31,751 --> 01:05:33,626
Just shut up.

663
01:05:34,668 --> 01:05:36,251
Listen to me.

664
01:05:40,376 --> 01:05:42,418
You know 
the powers of this water.

665
01:05:43,168 --> 01:05:45,335
If you ever hurt yourself...

666
01:05:47,835 --> 01:05:49,501
if anything happens to you…

667
01:05:49,668 --> 01:05:50,918
Nothing will happen to me.

668
01:05:51,668 --> 01:05:53,210
I need to get ready.

669
01:05:59,293 --> 01:06:01,043
Belle.

670
01:06:01,210 --> 01:06:02,543
If you don’t come back...

671
01:06:02,710 --> 01:06:04,751
I know, you will kill us all.

672
01:06:05,335 --> 01:06:06,668
No.

673
01:06:07,918 --> 01:06:09,710
I will die.

674
01:06:14,626 --> 01:06:16,085
I will come back here,

675
01:06:17,043 --> 01:06:18,418
at seven.

676
01:06:38,043 --> 01:06:39,418
- Who is there?

677
01:06:39,543 --> 01:06:41,418
I warn you, we are armed.

678
01:06:45,626 --> 01:06:46,918
Belle.

679
01:07:15,085 --> 01:07:16,918
Look at this mess.

680
01:07:17,126 --> 01:07:18,793
What are you doing with these weapons?

681
01:07:19,001 --> 01:07:21,126
Ask Maxime.
Shut up.

682
01:07:21,293 --> 01:07:22,418
Go back to your position!

683
01:07:22,543 --> 01:07:24,001
"Go back to your position?"
Yes.

684
01:07:24,168 --> 01:07:25,251
You think you are a general? Idiot.

685
01:07:25,418 --> 01:07:26,751
- Enough, enough.

686
01:07:26,918 --> 01:07:29,751
Don’t start again.
Stop defending him.

687
01:07:29,918 --> 01:07:32,710
Your drink wine all day, that scared are you?
Who is scared, ah?!

688
01:07:32,876 --> 01:07:33,876
Enough, enough!

689
01:07:34,501 --> 01:07:35,918
What is happening here?

690
01:07:36,126 --> 01:07:38,043
Have you all gone crazy?

691
01:07:42,001 --> 01:07:43,543
Come. Let’s go upstairs.

692
01:07:43,710 --> 01:07:45,501
It’s going to be fine. Don’t worry.

693
01:07:45,668 --> 01:07:48,626
Being sold as slaves to pay for Maxime’s 
debts is out of the question.

694
01:07:48,793 --> 01:07:51,418
They are going to get us on bord of a ship
full of sweaty sailors.

695
01:07:51,543 --> 01:07:53,918
Oh! And will they force us
to clean the holds?

696
01:07:54,126 --> 01:07:55,126
No.

697
01:07:55,210 --> 01:07:58,543
We are going to tell them we suffer from seasickness
and we can’t do housework.

698
01:07:58,710 --> 01:08:00,126
Oh yes.

700
01:08:02,668 --> 01:08:03,710
- Anne?

701
01:08:04,668 --> 01:08:06,043
Clotilde?

702
01:08:07,710 --> 01:08:09,210
I have come back.

703
01:08:09,519 --> 01:08:10,519
- Clotilde,

704
01:08:10,543 --> 01:08:12,043
do you see what I see?

705
01:08:12,210 --> 01:08:14,126
It’s Belle’s ghost
that has come back to haunt us,

706
01:08:14,293 --> 01:08:15,668
all read and bloody.

707
01:08:16,668 --> 01:08:18,543
You are not dreaming,
my beloved sisters.

708
01:08:19,501 --> 01:08:20,501
It’s really me.

709
01:08:20,543 --> 01:08:23,085
I have come to say
goodbye to you.

710
01:08:23,251 --> 01:08:25,001
Even in death, she is prettier than us.

711
01:08:25,168 --> 01:08:26,543
Look, that dress makes her look so elegant.

712
01:08:27,251 --> 01:08:29,293
Know that I will always love you.

713
01:08:29,460 --> 01:08:30,835
So will we, my little sister.

714
01:08:31,043 --> 01:08:32,251
We think about you all the time.

715
01:08:32,418 --> 01:08:34,085
But it was her who forced me
to take your bedroom.

716
01:08:35,501 --> 01:08:36,876
I knew it!

717
01:08:37,085 --> 01:08:38,793
I am going to take my revenge.

718
01:08:42,293 --> 01:08:43,335
Where is dad?

719
01:08:44,085 --> 01:08:45,626
He has been so depressed after you left,

720
01:08:45,793 --> 01:08:47,460
that he doesn’t even want to get off the bed.

721
01:08:53,210 --> 01:08:54,251
What was that dress?

722
01:09:01,543 --> 01:09:02,668
- Dad?

723
01:09:08,835 --> 01:09:10,085
It’s me,

724
01:09:11,001 --> 01:09:12,460
Belle.

725
01:09:14,168 --> 01:09:15,876
I am here.

726
01:09:19,710 --> 01:09:22,293
Come back to life, beloved father.

727
01:09:23,793 --> 01:09:25,876
Do it for me.

728
01:09:28,751 --> 01:09:30,251
Dad!

729
01:09:31,251 --> 01:09:32,501
Dad!

730 
01:09:42,501 --> 01:09:44,918
Have you ever seen a jewel this big?

731
01:09:46,376 --> 01:09:47,793
Do you remember the chest father brought from the castle?

732
01:09:48,001 --> 01:09:49,335
Ah no, not that, I forbid it.

733
01:09:49,501 --> 01:09:50,501
It’s our only chance, Tristan.

734
01:09:50,585 --> 01:09:52,876
While I live,
you will not go through this door.

738
01:10:40,251 --> 01:10:41,335
- Sleep.

739
01:10:42,001 --> 01:10:43,376
Sleep.

740
01:10:53,085 --> 01:10:54,501
Dream.

741
01:10:55,043 --> 01:10:56,293
Mystery.

742
01:10:57,126 --> 01:10:58,710
- Do you see me?

743
01:11:00,043 --> 01:11:02,251
Come, come.
- Listen to me.

744
01:11:21,352 --> 01:11:22,352
Look,

745
01:11:22,376 --> 01:11:24,835
its flanks tremble,
its fur glows.

746
01:11:25,918 --> 01:11:27,710
I can almost feel its scent.

747
01:11:27,876 --> 01:11:29,001
Its time has arrived.

748
01:11:29,876 --> 01:11:31,626
It belongs to me, understood?

752
01:13:08,835 --> 01:13:10,085
Quiet.

754
01:14:00,626 --> 01:14:03,293
I am the nymph of the forest.

755
01:14:07,085 --> 01:14:09,710
I was granted the wish
to take human form.

756
01:14:12,001 --> 01:14:14,585
I wanted to know
what men called love.

757
01:14:19,335 --> 01:14:20,460
And then I met you,

758
01:14:20,585 --> 01:14:22,085
my prince.

759
01:14:23,085 --> 01:14:24,376
Forgive me,

761
01:14:34,210 --> 01:14:35,210
father.

762
01:14:40,876 --> 01:14:42,668
God of the forest.

763
01:14:45,001 --> 01:14:46,585
Spare by beloved.

764
01:14:48,626 --> 01:14:51,293
He filled your daughter
with eternal love.

765
01:14:53,085 --> 01:14:54,085
Father.

766
01:14:54,918 --> 01:14:56,418
Spare him.

768
01:15:37,168 --> 01:15:39,918
- "A terrifying voice
resonated in the sky.

769
01:15:40,126 --> 01:15:43,210
"For having killed my daughter,
I turn you into a beast.

770
01:15:43,376 --> 01:15:45,501
"Only a woman
can save you,

771
01:15:45,626 --> 01:15:47,751
"but what woman
would want to love you?

772
01:15:48,835 --> 01:15:51,501
"I curse you for all eternity."

774
01:16:08,585 --> 01:16:10,460
You are betraying Belle.

775
01:16:11,543 --> 01:16:13,043
I am saving us.

776
01:16:13,210 --> 01:16:14,626
She will understand.

777
01:16:15,626 --> 01:16:17,793
You would have preferred
to have another brother, wouldn’t you?

778
01:16:28,168 --> 01:16:29,876
What are you doing here,
my little rabbit?

779
01:16:30,793 --> 01:16:32,626
Weren’t we going to meet in your shack?

780
01:16:32,793 --> 01:16:34,126
Look!

781
01:16:34,293 --> 01:16:37,126
My men got all dolled up
to meet your sister.

783
01:16:39,751 --> 01:16:41,126
I want to propose you a deal.

784
01:16:41,585 --> 01:16:43,335
I don’t want to have a deal with you.

785
01:16:43,501 --> 01:16:45,460
I was very patient.

786
01:16:47,376 --> 01:16:48,376
Look.

787
01:16:49,918 --> 01:16:51,168
This comes from an abandoned castle.

788
01:16:51,335 --> 01:16:53,210
If I take you there,
you can take the rest of the treasure

789
01:16:53,376 --> 01:16:54,501
and then you can erase my debt.

790
01:17:00,043 --> 01:17:01,335
And jewels like these,

791
01:17:01,501 --> 01:17:03,543
How many of them are there?
There are chests full of them.

792
01:17:06,168 --> 01:17:07,710
- Don’t let me down, my little rabit.

793
01:17:08,376 --> 01:17:10,501
It’s your last chance.
You know it.

794
01:17:11,376 --> 01:17:13,793
Tell your men to follow me.

795
01:17:15,918 --> 01:17:17,043
Do as he says.

796
01:17:23,918 --> 01:17:25,835
“More than anything in the world”

799
01:17:37,126 --> 01:17:39,418
"As he rushed
through the magical road,

800
01:17:39,543 --> 01:17:42,001
"Perducas started dreaming about
the treasure that awaited him.

801
01:17:42,168 --> 01:17:43,501
"He cursed his men,

802
01:17:43,626 --> 01:17:46,251
"because he thought of having 
to share his spoils with them.

803
01:17:46,418 --> 01:17:50,668
"He looked at Astrid and wondered
whether he preferred love or wealth.

01:17:50,835 --> 01:17:52,835
"Sometimes,
the souls of men become troubled.

"All their beliefs disappear

01:17:54,543 --> 01:17:56,168
"and they no longer have any doubts.

807
01:17:56,335 --> 01:17:57,335
"Meanwhile,

808
01:17:57,460 --> 01:17:59,835
"Belle relived the story
ff the prince who became a beast,

809
01:18:00,043 --> 01:18:02,876
"until the moment when she felt
a heartbreaking complaint.

810
01:18:29,626 --> 01:18:30,835
Dad.

811
01:18:36,085 --> 01:18:37,418
My child.

812
01:18:40,085 --> 01:18:41,085
Dad.

813
01:18:41,751 --> 01:18:43,543
I really missed you.

814
01:18:45,085 --> 01:18:46,085
- Belle!

815
01:18:48,227 --> 01:18:49,227
Father?

816
01:18:49,251 --> 01:18:50,668
Oh, my God!

817
01:18:50,835 --> 01:18:52,876
Anne! Clotilde!

818
01:18:53,085 --> 01:18:54,418
Father is awake.

819
01:18:54,543 --> 01:18:57,293
Anne, Clotilde, come quick!
I was so afraid.

820
01:18:57,460 --> 01:18:58,543
- Come quick!

821
01:18:59,460 --> 01:19:02,001
Something has changed in you.

822
01:19:02,168 --> 01:19:03,793
Your eyes...

823
01:19:05,835 --> 01:19:06,835
also your voice...

824
01:19:07,835 --> 01:19:09,626
I must leave again, father.

825
01:19:10,793 --> 01:19:12,668
I must return there.

827
01:19:19,543 --> 01:19:20,823
Look at all the dead coming back to life!

828
01:19:20,918 --> 01:19:23,001
It’s the most beautiful day of my life.

829
01:19:25,876 --> 01:19:27,793
You are crushing me, silly.

830
01:19:42,751 --> 01:19:44,168
Oh.

832
01:19:59,751 --> 01:20:01,501
Do you feel something?

833
01:20:02,168 --> 01:20:03,460
Danger.

834
01:20:03,585 --> 01:20:05,585
I feel it, it’s everywhere.

835
01:20:12,835 --> 01:20:14,543
All that we love, eh?

836
01:20:18,710 --> 01:20:19,793
Let’s go.

837
01:20:20,001 --> 01:20:22,501
You three, you will go west.

838
01:20:23,168 --> 01:20:25,710
The rest, you go east.

839
01:20:26,501 --> 01:20:27,793
And you, my little rabbits,

840
01:20:28,001 --> 01:20:29,335
you will walk before me.

844
01:21:26,210 --> 01:21:28,335
- Céleste Astrid.

845
01:21:31,460 --> 01:21:34,126
Enough fear...
Enough blood...

846
01:21:34,293 --> 01:21:35,793
with all your strength...

847
01:21:36,418 --> 01:21:37,918
save your lover...

848
01:21:40,251 --> 01:21:41,418
Save yourself.

849
01:21:41,543 --> 01:21:43,043
You owe it to him.

850
01:21:44,210 --> 01:21:45,751
So faithful.

851
01:21:45,918 --> 01:21:48,460
Unless you want to suffer an eternal agony,

852
01:21:50,418 --> 01:21:54,001
Take the gold in your hands, Astrid.

853
01:21:55,585 --> 01:21:57,918
Take the gold, Astrid.

854
01:22:01,376 --> 01:22:03,168
Save him if you can.

855
01:22:03,543 --> 01:22:05,460
Take the gold in your hands.

857
01:22:13,876 --> 01:22:15,501
Where are my brothers?

858
01:22:15,626 --> 01:22:17,001
I must hurry.

859
01:22:18,626 --> 01:22:20,043
Maxime also took your horse.

860
01:22:20,793 --> 01:22:23,626
I tried to stop them, but…
Forgive me, Belle.

863
01:22:53,793 --> 01:22:54,918
-	Quick, quick!

864
01:23:03,210 --> 01:23:05,001
I don’t like it
when you are away from me.

865
01:23:06,061 --> 01:23:07,061
Where were you?

866
01:23:07,085 --> 01:23:08,793
If I tell you to leave right now,

867
01:23:09,001 --> 01:23:10,501
would you follow me?

868
01:23:12,293 --> 01:23:13,376
Is that gold?

869
01:23:13,501 --> 01:23:15,626
- This arrows has a great power.

870
01:23:15,793 --> 01:23:18,085
I feel we can have more
than than this treasure with it.

871
01:23:18,251 --> 01:23:20,710
We will be respected.
We will be above everything.

872
01:23:22,501 --> 01:23:23,751
Open your eyes.

873
01:23:23,918 --> 01:23:26,918
We have finally found
that which we always looked for.

874
01:23:30,918 --> 01:23:31,918
Stop.

875
01:23:32,668 --> 01:23:36,460
Who assures me that you won’t
come back later to steal my treasure?

876
01:23:36,585 --> 01:23:39,918
If you no longer believe in me,
at least listen to the prophecy of the cards.

877
01:23:40,876 --> 01:23:42,501
What have you seen?

878
01:23:42,626 --> 01:23:44,126
Death.

879
01:23:44,793 --> 01:23:45,835
Yours?

880
01:23:46,043 --> 01:23:47,835
Or mine?
What do you prefer?

881
01:23:48,543 --> 01:23:50,585
None, my love.

882
01:23:51,668 --> 01:23:53,126
And because you are not sure,

883
01:23:53,293 --> 01:23:55,918
Let’s say it’s his.
There, let’s say

884
01:23:56,126 --> 01:23:58,168
is that guy who will die tonight.

885
01:24:05,793 --> 01:24:07,335
So?

886
01:24:07,501 --> 01:24:10,335
That door will not open
by itself,

889
01:25:05,876 --> 01:25:07,460
An abandoned castle?

890
01:25:50,751 --> 01:25:52,126
Buck up, my rogues.

891
01:25:52,293 --> 01:25:54,335
There are more floors to visit.

892
01:25:54,501 --> 01:25:56,085
- YES!

893
01:26:13,376 --> 01:26:15,418
We need to find a road.

894
01:26:16,835 --> 01:26:18,251
I lost these bindings when I came here.

895
01:26:18,418 --> 01:26:20,585
We are not far,
I am sure.

896
01:26:23,501 --> 01:26:25,001
Belle, what are you doing?

897
01:26:25,168 --> 01:26:27,043
Belle, stop. You will hurt yourself.

898
01:26:28,168 --> 01:26:29,168
Come back.

899
01:26:29,876 --> 01:26:31,168
Come back, Belle.

900
01:26:33,085 --> 01:26:35,210
Belle, please, come back.

901
01:26:35,626 --> 01:26:36,626
Belle!

904
01:27:15,126 --> 01:27:16,793
God of the forest,

905
01:27:17,460 --> 01:27:19,126
listen to me.

906
01:27:21,501 --> 01:27:23,876
Let me come back to him.

907
01:27:24,460 --> 01:27:26,251
It’s my only wish.

908
01:27:27,418 --> 01:27:29,168
My only desire.

912
01:28:10,876 --> 01:28:11,876
You were wrong.

913
01:28:12,043 --> 01:28:14,251
No one was waiting for us.

914
01:28:15,085 --> 01:28:18,126
Don’t spoil the fun.
Now, I am rich.

915
01:28:19,710 --> 01:28:21,918
I can grant you all your wishes.

916
01:28:22,376 --> 01:28:23,710
My wish of us dying together?

917
01:28:24,251 --> 01:28:26,043
Your cards no longer call the shots.

918
01:28:26,585 --> 01:28:27,585
It’s me.

925
01:29:42,501 --> 01:29:44,376
Why does he squeal like that?

934
01:32:10,876 --> 01:32:13,126
Where are my brothers?
There, they are with Perducas.

935
01:32:20,126 --> 01:32:21,710
He is going to kill them!

936
01:32:45,144 --> 01:32:46,144
Maxime!

938
01:32:52,876 --> 01:32:55,043
Save yourself.
Ask Belle to forgive me.

939
01:32:55,210 --> 01:32:56,876
No.
Quick, let’s go!

940
01:32:57,543 --> 01:32:59,418
You will ask her yourself.

941
01:33:11,543 --> 01:33:12,543
Stop!

943
01:33:24,043 --> 01:33:26,668
You, my little one, you are going to help me.

944
01:33:35,460 --> 01:33:37,043
Let her go.

945
01:33:38,793 --> 01:33:41,043
What are you?

946
01:33:41,210 --> 01:33:42,210
A lion?

947
01:33:42,376 --> 01:33:43,543
A big cat?

948
01:33:43,710 --> 01:33:45,376
Yes, and I will drain you of your blood.

949
01:33:46,168 --> 01:33:48,710
You can purr
all you want,

950
01:33:48,876 --> 01:33:51,418
but if you don’t want
me to crack your doll,

951
01:33:51,543 --> 01:33:52,918
let me go.

952
01:34:30,168 --> 01:34:31,543
I beg you!

953
01:34:32,668 --> 01:34:34,710
Remember
you were once a man.

954
01:34:35,876 --> 01:34:38,085
Spare this vermin
and let my brothers go.

955
01:34:41,543 --> 01:34:44,918
The important thing is that I am here,
that I am with you.

961
01:35:32,626 --> 01:35:34,210
Help me!

962
01:35:44,085 --> 01:35:45,876
Quick! Quick!

965
01:36:50,126 --> 01:36:52,043
- Don’t leave me!

967
01:37:04,626 --> 01:37:07,335
My love,
you fate will be worst than mine.

969
01:37:23,793 --> 01:37:25,210
Come and help me!

970
01:37:25,918 --> 01:37:27,251
Hurry!

971
01:37:33,793 --> 01:37:35,126
Into the pond, quick.

972
01:37:35,293 --> 01:37:36,376
Go!

973
01:38:04,293 --> 01:38:06,126
He is not breathing anymore.

974
01:38:14,126 --> 01:38:16,418
Don’t worry about us.
Let’s go, my brothers!

976
01:39:15,585 --> 01:39:17,668
We missed our dinner.

977
01:39:22,043 --> 01:39:25,001
You say that
as if you regretted it.

978
01:39:26,918 --> 01:39:28,293
Belle,

979
01:39:29,001 --> 01:39:30,418
Do you think that with...

980
01:39:31,751 --> 01:39:33,626
a little bit of patience,

981
01:39:34,501 --> 01:39:36,668
or maybe by habit,

982
01:39:38,418 --> 01:39:40,543
you would have come

983
01:39:41,585 --> 01:39:43,293
to love me?

984
01:39:47,251 --> 01:39:49,043
But I already love you.

992
01:42:12,543 --> 01:42:15,085
-Okay, this story has ended.

993
01:42:16,501 --> 01:42:18,210
It’s time to sleep.

994
01:42:20,043 --> 01:42:21,293
Go, go.

995
01:42:32,168 --> 01:42:35,168
And the brothers and sisters,
what happened to them?

996
01:42:35,335 --> 01:42:37,043
- They left for the city.

997
01:42:37,210 --> 01:42:39,710
The brothers opened a printery
to edit books.

998
01:42:39,876 --> 01:42:42,501
And the sisters,
they married twins.

999
01:42:42,668 --> 01:42:44,876
Even they are unable to tell them apart.

1000
01:42:45,085 --> 01:42:47,168
Like that,
they will always be together.

1001
01:42:47,335 --> 01:42:48,501
And the father?

1002
01:42:49,543 --> 01:42:51,210
He opened
a flower shop.

1003
01:42:51,376 --> 01:42:52,376
- Him too?

1004
01:42:52,460 --> 01:42:54,210
Yes, him too.

1005
01:42:57,501 --> 01:42:59,251
Sweet dreams.

1006
01:43:02,751 --> 01:43:03,835
Mom...

1007
01:43:04,043 --> 01:43:05,501
Sleep, my sweethearts!
