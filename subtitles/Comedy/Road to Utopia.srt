1
00:00:07,195 --> 00:00:10,460
For those of you who
don't go to the movies,
let me introduce myself.

2
00:00:10,532 --> 00:00:12,727
My name is
Robert Benchley.

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,200
Well, no matter.

4
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:18,797
For one reason or another,
the motion picture which
you are about to see...

5
00:00:18,873 --> 00:00:20,898
is not very
clear in spots.

6
00:00:20,975 --> 00:00:24,741
As a matter of fact,
it was made to demonstrate how
not to make a motion picture...

7
00:00:24,812 --> 00:00:27,872
and at the same time
win an Academy Award.

8
00:00:27,949 --> 00:00:32,283
Now, someone in what is
known as ''the front office''...

9
00:00:32,353 --> 00:00:35,322
has thought that an
occasional word from me...

10
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:39,520
might help clarify
the plot and other vague
portions of the film.

11
00:00:39,594 --> 00:00:42,358
Personally, I doubt it.

12
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:44,523
Shall we go?

13
00:00:44,547 --> 00:01:14,747
...:::Lord Sadler:::...
lordsadler2012@gmail.com

14
00:02:09,317 --> 00:02:12,411
It's 8:00, Pa.

15
00:02:12,487 --> 00:02:15,820
Bedtime.
Put down that paper.

16
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:18,688
In a minute, Ma.
In a minute.

17
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,694
Land's sakes, pa.

18
00:02:20,762 --> 00:02:24,823
Sittin'there night after night
pouring your eyes out
over that old stock market.

19
00:02:24,899 --> 00:02:27,367
Think by now
you'd be tired of it.

20
00:02:27,435 --> 00:02:31,565
Well, 'tain't easy, ma,
to change the habits of a lifetime.

21
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:34,870
Lot of nonsense--all that
buyin'and sellin'-- Bulls and Bears.

22
00:02:34,942 --> 00:02:38,503
Can't see how
a body can figure it out.

23
00:02:38,579 --> 00:02:43,016
Right now it's
kind of bearish,
Ma, kind of bearish.

24
00:02:43,084 --> 00:02:45,245
Come along,
it's 8:00.

25
00:02:45,319 --> 00:02:48,413
I'm not a child. I know
when it's time to go to bed.

26
00:02:48,489 --> 00:02:50,923
Pa!
It's time.

27
00:02:50,992 --> 00:02:55,053
Come on, Pa.
Doc says I can stay
up till half past.

28
00:02:55,129 --> 00:02:59,327
I know, but by the time
we get your ears washed
and your teeth put away--

29
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:03,131
All right, I guess.
Here we go.

30
00:03:03,204 --> 00:03:06,367
Look and see if
everything got up with me.

31
00:03:06,441 --> 00:03:09,137
#For always #

32
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:13,806
Do you hear
what I hear?
I hope not.

33
00:03:13,881 --> 00:03:16,281
That voice.
What voice?

34
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:21,083
Listen. What does it
sound like?
Who'd be sellin'
fish at this hour?

35
00:03:21,155 --> 00:03:25,182
After 3 5 years--
Pa, you don't think--

36
00:03:25,259 --> 00:03:27,489
Oh, no,
it couldn't be.

37
00:03:27,562 --> 00:03:31,760
But it is. That voice.
I'd know it anywhere.

38
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:34,063
You would, huh?

39
00:03:34,135 --> 00:03:36,831
Shuck and gosh darn it.

40
00:03:44,946 --> 00:03:48,609
And I thought this was
gonna be an ''A'' picture.
Duke!

41
00:03:48,683 --> 00:03:50,583
Sal!
Duke.!

42
00:03:50,651 --> 00:03:53,279
Sal!
It isn't true.
I don't believe it.

43
00:03:53,354 --> 00:03:55,447
Just got in from Alaska
and I came right to you.

44
00:03:55,523 --> 00:03:58,651
Right from out
of the grave.
Nice diggin', hmm?

45
00:03:58,726 --> 00:04:01,024
My, uh, nieces.

46
00:04:01,095 --> 00:04:03,529
Girls, old friends of
your uncle's, the Hootons.

47
00:04:03,598 --> 00:04:05,156
How do you do?

48
00:04:05,233 --> 00:04:09,169
Just think, 3 5 years, Duke.
It doesn't seem possible.

49
00:04:09,237 --> 00:04:13,071
Sal, let me look at you.
You're a sight for sore eyes.

50
00:04:13,141 --> 00:04:15,632
And Chester,
you're a sight.

51
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:18,941
Don't forget a man is
just as young as he feels.

52
00:04:21,315 --> 00:04:24,284
Take 'em away. The doctor
says I can't have 'em anymore.

53
00:04:24,352 --> 00:04:27,253
You've got very little
to complain about.

54
00:04:27,321 --> 00:04:29,846
You won the girl,
got the gold mine-- All this.

55
00:04:29,924 --> 00:04:32,518
Things have surely
stacked up well for you.

56
00:04:32,593 --> 00:04:35,687
Who's doin' your
stackin' lately?
Chester!

57
00:04:35,763 --> 00:04:38,755
Girls, the Hootons and I
have a few things to discuss.

58
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:42,792
If you'll run along, Uncle will
meet you later at the club.

59
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:45,134
Nice goin',
''Uncle.''

60
00:04:45,206 --> 00:04:48,437
Nice family tree and
the limbs ain't bad either.

61
00:04:48,509 --> 00:04:51,307
Duke, tell us
all about Alaska.

62
00:04:51,379 --> 00:04:54,746
We left you for dead.
How did you ever get away?

63
00:04:54,816 --> 00:04:57,979
It's a long story.
I wouldn't want to bore you.

64
00:04:58,052 --> 00:05:00,384
It's never
stopped you before.

65
00:05:00,454 --> 00:05:03,321
Tell us.
You remember when
it all started.

66
00:05:03,391 --> 00:05:07,327
Chester and I were
playing San Francisco.
The turn of the century.

67
00:05:07,395 --> 00:05:10,558
There was gold in the Klondike
and San Francisco was wide open.

68
00:05:10,631 --> 00:05:13,259
A million suckers just
waitin' to be clipped.

69
00:05:13,334 --> 00:05:16,770
There was excitement
and adventure.
There was romance.

70
00:05:16,838 --> 00:05:19,068
And one night, you remember,
there was murder.

71
00:05:24,078 --> 00:05:27,172
This is a device
known as ''the flashback.''

72
00:05:27,248 --> 00:05:29,682
Okay, George.

73
00:05:39,961 --> 00:05:42,259
Gold!
Millions!

74
00:05:45,366 --> 00:05:47,425
Open up.

75
00:05:50,838 --> 00:05:56,367
What happened?
Sperry, McGurk...
the window.

76
00:05:56,444 --> 00:06:00,005
What is it,
Mr. Lattimer?

77
00:06:00,081 --> 00:06:05,109
They got it--
The map, your father's mine.

78
00:06:05,186 --> 00:06:07,620
The police
will get them.

79
00:06:07,688 --> 00:06:11,124
Never.
They're too smart.

80
00:06:11,192 --> 00:06:13,717
But Mr. Lattimer--

81
00:06:13,794 --> 00:06:16,126
Alaska--

82
00:06:16,197 --> 00:06:19,633
Go to Skagway.

83
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:24,603
Ask for Ace Larson.
Ace Larson?

84
00:06:29,911 --> 00:06:34,439
Where do I arrange my passage?
No time, lady.
Get it on board.

85
00:06:34,515 --> 00:06:36,745
- Take it away,Joe.
- Right, Cap.

86
00:06:36,817 --> 00:06:39,513
You better hurry,
we're shovin' off.
Thank you.

87
00:06:41,622 --> 00:06:43,954
Take it away,
boys.

88
00:06:45,159 --> 00:06:48,856
Hey, look!
We've gotta
get on that boat.

89
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:51,865
Too late, mister.
Next boat's tonight at midnight.

90
00:06:51,933 --> 00:06:55,767
Extra.! Murder in Hotel Room.
Read all about it.

91
00:06:55,836 --> 00:06:59,101
Map of Van Hoyden Mine Stolen.
Extra.! Read all about it.!

92
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,710
It's them!

93
00:07:08,783 --> 00:07:11,479
Who?
Sperry and McGurk.

94
00:07:20,962 --> 00:07:34,638
##

95
00:07:34,709 --> 00:07:38,873
# Everybody here knows
Good Time Charlie #

96
00:07:38,946 --> 00:07:41,744
# Charlie is
a perfect clown #

97
00:07:41,816 --> 00:07:45,445
#Always kills the folks
with funny jokes #

98
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:49,114
#And turns the parlor
upside down #

99
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:52,921
# Everybody sure likes
Good Time Charlie #

100
00:07:52,994 --> 00:07:56,430
# No one ever
saw him frown #

101
00:07:56,497 --> 00:07:58,488
# But here's
the funniest part #

102
00:07:58,566 --> 00:08:02,297
# Down deep
in his heart #

103
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:06,568
# He's the lonesomest
man in town #

104
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:11,805
Charlie, why are you on this
mad, mad merry-go-round?
Ha, ha, ha.

105
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:14,347
I'm your friend.

106
00:08:14,415 --> 00:08:16,576
You can tell me,
Charlie.

107
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:19,175
You're wasting
your life away.

108
00:08:19,253 --> 00:08:21,949
Someday you'll be
old and all alone.

109
00:08:22,023 --> 00:08:24,253
Think it over.

110
00:08:24,325 --> 00:08:26,418
You're not fooling me,
Charlie.

111
00:08:26,494 --> 00:08:28,826
It's your childhood
sweetheart.

112
00:08:28,896 --> 00:08:31,262
But you're a great,
great man.

113
00:08:31,332 --> 00:08:33,960
Great to take it
the way you have.

114
00:08:35,403 --> 00:08:38,736
You're doin' the
right thing. Laugh!
Ha, ha, ha.

115
00:08:38,806 --> 00:08:40,330
Dance!

116
00:08:40,408 --> 00:08:42,000
Play the fool!

117
00:08:43,611 --> 00:08:49,140
# He's the lonesomest
man in town #

118
00:08:49,216 --> 00:08:53,482
#The lonesomest
man in town #

119
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,994
Three, a-two,
a-three, a-four.

120
00:09:22,216 --> 00:09:24,582
# He's always
good for a laugh #

121
00:09:24,652 --> 00:09:27,280
# But...
you don't know the half #

122
00:09:27,354 --> 00:09:29,686
# He's only
happy-go-lucky #

123
00:09:29,757 --> 00:09:31,850
#Till the lights
are turned down #

124
00:09:31,926 --> 00:09:35,657
#Then he's the lonesomest
man in town ##

125
00:09:45,706 --> 00:09:49,142
And now, to go from the
super to the supernatural,

126
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:51,144
we bring you
''Ghost-O,''

127
00:09:51,212 --> 00:09:53,874
the most amazing
novelty game of the age,

128
00:09:53,948 --> 00:09:55,472
stolen at great personal risk...

129
00:09:55,549 --> 00:09:58,313
from the high priest of
the Lost Tribe of Darkest Anesthesia...

130
00:09:58,385 --> 00:10:01,650
and brought to these shores by
that great oriental mystic...

131
00:10:01,722 --> 00:10:05,419
and secret Hindu potentate,
professor Hakin Zambini.!

132
00:10:05,493 --> 00:10:07,393
And now, ''Ghost-O''...

133
00:10:07,461 --> 00:10:10,589
and the man who
has brought fortunes to
thousands of lucky people,

134
00:10:10,664 --> 00:10:12,996
professor Zambini.

135
00:10:15,069 --> 00:10:17,060
Holy Toledo!
Holy Toledo!

136
00:10:17,138 --> 00:10:19,936
Bushwa.
Silence, dear friends.

137
00:10:20,007 --> 00:10:22,635
I shall attempt to
contact the other world.

138
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:24,803
Master, shall
I remove myself?

139
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:27,871
The spirit will
do it for us.

140
00:10:31,218 --> 00:10:35,780
Ala-kaballa, presto-sturgando,
double-forzando.

141
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,628
Silence!
Silence, dear friends.

142
00:10:41,695 --> 00:10:43,720
I feel the presence
of spirits in the room.

143
00:10:43,797 --> 00:10:45,958
What I do
for money.

144
00:10:46,033 --> 00:10:51,266
Matoom-bomba.
Diddy-wa-diddy matoom-bomba.

145
00:10:51,338 --> 00:10:53,272
Diddy-wa-diddy, ester-chay.
The oint-jay is ull-fay of ump-chays--

146
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:57,834
Ump-chays--
There's one here, too.

147
00:10:59,013 --> 00:11:00,947
Spirits,
are you with us?

148
00:11:01,015 --> 00:11:04,576
Are you there?
Am I there?
Where can I go?

149
00:11:04,652 --> 00:11:07,712
- Are you there?
- If I was, I wouldn't be here.

150
00:11:07,788 --> 00:11:11,189
Spirits,
are you with us?

151
00:11:11,258 --> 00:11:14,227
That's the spirit!
We have made contact.

152
00:11:14,295 --> 00:11:18,129
To prove it, I shall have
the spirit do my bidding.
Spirit, lift the table.

153
00:11:18,199 --> 00:11:20,861
Spirit, lift.!

154
00:11:22,603 --> 00:11:25,436
The flesh is willing but
the spirits are weak.

155
00:11:25,506 --> 00:11:28,202
However, we shall proceed
with the magic game of Ghost-O.

156
00:11:28,275 --> 00:11:30,607
Taking this
fabulously jeweled box,

157
00:11:30,678 --> 00:11:33,909
I shall place
a five-dollar bill therein,

158
00:11:33,981 --> 00:11:36,040
close the
box regretfully,

159
00:11:36,116 --> 00:11:38,414
incant a few magic
words thereover,

160
00:11:38,485 --> 00:11:41,716
and gamble upon the
generosity of the spirits.

161
00:11:41,789 --> 00:11:47,125
Matoom-bomba Ester-chay,
willet-gay under-day
dwit-ay matoom-bomba.

162
00:11:49,063 --> 00:11:52,362
What have we here?
A crisp ten-dollar bill.

163
00:11:52,433 --> 00:11:54,867
Indeed, the spirits
are generous tonight.

164
00:11:54,935 --> 00:11:57,233
Why am I monopolizing
this lucrative phenomenon?

165
00:11:57,304 --> 00:11:59,670
Who among you would
like to try for 1 0,

166
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:02,004
20, 30 dollars--
any small amount?

167
00:12:02,076 --> 00:12:03,941
I'll try
for a dollar.

168
00:12:04,011 --> 00:12:06,502
A dollar? An assignment
for one of the smaller spirits;

169
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:09,811
however, a buck is a buck and
the spirits are always in there.

170
00:12:09,883 --> 00:12:13,649
Matoom-bomba
matoom a-double-bomba.

171
00:12:13,721 --> 00:12:18,681
A crisp new
five-dollar bill.

172
00:12:18,759 --> 00:12:23,128
Five for one. Here you are.
Who among you shall be next?

173
00:12:23,197 --> 00:12:25,392
10 dollars!
I'll try for 15.

174
00:12:25,466 --> 00:12:29,368
We are building, however,
it's a big box and there's
room in there for both of you.

175
00:12:29,436 --> 00:12:32,371
The spirits will have to
take dead aim this time.
Atch-it-way, Ester-chay.

176
00:12:32,439 --> 00:12:35,237
Matoom-bomba, Sam-cheron
on-the-half-shell.

177
00:12:35,309 --> 00:12:38,176
Hiya, George!
Welcome home, Abe!

178
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:43,814
Looks like a spirit got
away with this one, folks.

179
00:12:43,884 --> 00:12:47,251
That's the spirit.
Sometimes he puts,
sometimes he takes.

180
00:12:47,321 --> 00:12:50,620
Who's next? Just
bring a buck in a truck.

181
00:12:50,691 --> 00:12:53,489
Ten dollars.
Twenty-five.

182
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:56,188
Twenty dollars here.
Don't get shut out.

183
00:12:58,565 --> 00:13:01,966
Wait a minute.
Let's try in here.

184
00:13:06,006 --> 00:13:08,099
There they are!

185
00:13:08,175 --> 00:13:10,234
Out the
back way!

186
00:13:11,578 --> 00:13:16,413
Just a moment,
please.

187
00:13:16,483 --> 00:13:19,316
They don't seem to
think we're on the level.

188
00:13:19,386 --> 00:13:22,287
Some people are
so suspicious.

189
00:13:24,992 --> 00:13:29,019
Ghost-O! I didn't think there
was one more way to get the cops
after us, but you found it!

190
00:13:29,096 --> 00:13:31,929
50 for Duke, 50 for Chester.
1 0 for Duke, 1 0 for Chester.

191
00:13:31,999 --> 00:13:36,868
Some life. Always one jump
ahead of the Sheriff.
5 for Duke, 5 for Chester.

192
00:13:36,937 --> 00:13:40,134
That boat sails
in 20 minutes.
Let it sail.

193
00:13:40,207 --> 00:13:42,334
Look, mastermind,
the tour is over.

194
00:13:42,409 --> 00:13:44,639
We've been posse-baitin'
every town from coast to coast.

195
00:13:44,712 --> 00:13:48,910
We just ran out of towns.
From now on, it's oceans
and we take boats.

196
00:13:48,982 --> 00:13:52,418
A Confederate ten-spot!
How can people be so crooked?

197
00:13:52,486 --> 00:13:55,944
We're taking
the boat to New York.
Not that boat.

198
00:13:56,023 --> 00:13:59,481
Going the wrong way?
It's going south,
should be going north.

199
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:03,052
Going north?
Where they got that yellow stuff...
that ever-lovin' powder.

200
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:05,394
Gold?
That's right.

201
00:14:05,466 --> 00:14:07,457
Alaska!
Yes.

202
00:14:07,534 --> 00:14:11,163
No you don't! Alaska?
It's so cold...

203
00:14:11,238 --> 00:14:13,172
if you shake hands,
they take it and throw it away.

204
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:16,539
It's Utopia.
Everybody's getting gold.

205
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:18,908
I got all the gold
I want in my teeth.

206
00:14:18,979 --> 00:14:21,311
I'm takin' my dough to Brooklyn
and opening a Turkish bath--
with tables for ladies.

207
00:14:21,382 --> 00:14:24,749
Where're you going
with all that cabbage?
I'm gonna pickle it.

208
00:14:24,818 --> 00:14:28,219
Yours? All of it?
What happened to 50-50?
All of it.

209
00:14:28,288 --> 00:14:32,725
You've been leading me
by the nose, chiseling
me right and left.

210
00:14:32,793 --> 00:14:36,092
Me chiseling you?
I got a record
of every chizz.

211
00:14:36,163 --> 00:14:38,757
This is fantastic.
It's right here
in black and white.

212
00:14:38,832 --> 00:14:41,198
Niagara Falls...
$300 for hospital bills.

213
00:14:41,268 --> 00:14:44,499
All you had to do was
find some yokel and send him
over the falls in a barrel.

214
00:14:44,571 --> 00:14:47,267
It was a great stunt.
I almost
broke my neck.

215
00:14:47,341 --> 00:14:49,673
Pittsburgh, Chicago,
and how 'bout Kansas City?

216
00:14:49,743 --> 00:14:54,009
You picked my pocket of
7 5 bucks so you could take
Mabel Bronschweiger on a buggy.

217
00:14:54,081 --> 00:14:57,642
Mabel Bronschweiger.
Lady blacksmith.
She was your girl.

218
00:14:57,718 --> 00:15:01,518
I sat in the hotel lobby
while you took her for
a ride in the woods.

219
00:15:01,588 --> 00:15:05,388
She was in fresh air.
Didn't I front for
you in Oklahoma?

220
00:15:05,459 --> 00:15:08,485
Hilda,
the oilman's daughter?
Sent you in there.

221
00:15:08,562 --> 00:15:12,020
Was she born or did
they have to drill for her?

222
00:15:12,099 --> 00:15:14,829
$1 200 worth right there,
but I'll settle for this.

223
00:15:14,902 --> 00:15:18,133
You wanna go to Alaska
and be a blubber-ball for
a bunch of trained seals?

224
00:15:18,205 --> 00:15:22,471
Go ahead, I'm
headin' home.
I can't stand in
your way.

225
00:15:22,543 --> 00:15:25,842
If that's the way you feel,
that's the way you feel.

226
00:15:25,913 --> 00:15:27,881
That's the way
I feel about it.

227
00:15:27,948 --> 00:15:31,213
Don't start tellin' my fortune.
It won't do you any good.

228
00:15:32,686 --> 00:15:35,246
What do you think of this?
A black nine on a red jack.

229
00:15:35,322 --> 00:15:38,951
You use those cards to trick me
in every crooked deal we had.

230
00:15:39,026 --> 00:15:43,463
No more, I'm too smart.
You're wastin' you're time,
DukeJohnson.

231
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:46,624
I'm goin' right back
where I-- What is it?

232
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:49,692
What's it say?
It's nothing.

233
00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:52,500
You can say that again.
I know those cards.

234
00:15:52,573 --> 00:15:56,339
This is amazing!
They're as phony as you are.
It's lucky I'm smart--

235
00:15:56,410 --> 00:16:01,245
What is it?
What do you see?
You're not interested.

236
00:16:01,315 --> 00:16:04,307
It's a partnership?
It's us.
We're back in New York.

237
00:16:04,384 --> 00:16:06,944
New York?
Yes, and we're rich.

238
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:10,421
We're driving down to 5th Avenue
in a gold-plated carriage.

239
00:16:10,491 --> 00:16:13,051
5th Avenue?
Yeah, we're sittin' there
smoking dollar cigars...

240
00:16:13,126 --> 00:16:15,458
and we're throwing $50 bills
at the round haircuts.

241
00:16:15,529 --> 00:16:18,054
5th Avenue?
We just turned
down 42nd Street.

242
00:16:18,131 --> 00:16:20,190
Wait'll I get back
in the carriage.

243
00:16:20,267 --> 00:16:22,633
Where you been?
You don't want that crowd
to get all that dough?

244
00:16:22,703 --> 00:16:24,967
Let them have it.
We've got billions.

245
00:16:25,038 --> 00:16:28,201
Where'd
we get it?
Utopia.

246
00:16:28,275 --> 00:16:32,905
Alaska? Pretty smart.
Gave me a fast shuffle, huh?

247
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:36,279
You'd better face it.
The cards say Alaska.

248
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:38,341
No wonder,
it's a cold deck.

249
00:16:41,154 --> 00:16:46,353
This seems to be a scene
they put in after I saw
the picture in the studio.

250
00:16:46,426 --> 00:16:50,385
Obviously a lot of extras--
I don't know.

251
00:16:50,464 --> 00:16:54,127
Read all about it.
''Van Hoyden Murderers
Still at Large. ''

252
00:16:54,201 --> 00:16:56,169
Extra paper.
Read all about it.

253
00:16:56,236 --> 00:16:58,170
Extra paper.

254
00:16:58,238 --> 00:17:00,172
Police Anticipate
an Early Arrest.

255
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,334
Van Hoyden's Murderers
Still at Large. Extra.

256
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:06,607
Hey, boy!
See what happened
to Happy Hooligan.

257
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:11,208
Careful, don't get hurt.
You'll snap off a thumb.

258
00:17:11,285 --> 00:17:16,621
Keep it.
Well, Chester, looks like
the end of the line for you and I.

259
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:19,853
There goes Chester and
there goes little old Duke.

260
00:17:19,927 --> 00:17:23,021
That's pretty heavy carfare.
How're you gonna make it?

261
00:17:23,096 --> 00:17:25,826
I'll get along somehow.
Don't worry about me.

262
00:17:25,899 --> 00:17:29,027
Well, Duke,
I guess this is it.

263
00:17:29,102 --> 00:17:31,332
I never thought
we'd end this way.

264
00:17:31,405 --> 00:17:34,533
It's so different.
I'm holdin' the dough
and you're holdin' the bag.

265
00:17:34,608 --> 00:17:36,542
I never thought
I'd have the biggest end.

266
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:39,238
You've always had
much the biggest end.

267
00:17:39,313 --> 00:17:42,771
Where do you keep your butter?
It was great while it lasted.

268
00:17:42,849 --> 00:17:46,808
What a combo.
Lot of laughs.
Lot of snickers.

269
00:17:46,887 --> 00:17:50,948
We had a couple of things
that money couldn't buy.
I usually got the ugly one.

270
00:17:51,024 --> 00:17:53,390
No hard feelings.
No hard
feelings at all.

271
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:55,690
So long.
So long.

272
00:17:55,762 --> 00:17:57,957
Well, see ya.

273
00:17:58,031 --> 00:18:00,090
Chester?

274
00:18:00,167 --> 00:18:02,362
Huh?

275
00:18:04,404 --> 00:18:07,840
I can't let you go like this.
Not without letting you know...

276
00:18:07,908 --> 00:18:11,173
whatever happens,
you can always count on me.

277
00:18:11,244 --> 00:18:13,474
That's fine, Duke,
just fine.

278
00:18:13,547 --> 00:18:16,573
I want you to feel that
whatever I have is yours.

279
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:20,780
Somehow I feel that
whatever you have is mine.

280
00:18:20,854 --> 00:18:25,655
Duke, that little speech
touched me. We're pals.

281
00:18:25,726 --> 00:18:28,456
If we want something,
we don't have to ask for it.

282
00:18:28,528 --> 00:18:31,691
We know it's there
and we take it.

283
00:18:31,765 --> 00:18:37,226
This is it, son. Let me
have one last look at you.

284
00:18:37,304 --> 00:18:42,674
Duke--
Don't speak. Don't say it.
Go quickly and don't look back.

285
00:18:54,121 --> 00:18:56,612
So long, Duke!

286
00:18:56,690 --> 00:18:59,420
Good-bye, Chester.
No hard feelings.

287
00:18:59,493 --> 00:19:03,156
I forgive you for everything;
Hilda, Mabel, the whole works.

288
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:06,358
Even for trying
to pick my pocket just now.

289
00:19:09,403 --> 00:19:12,861
Why, you dirty rogue!
Wait a minute there!

290
00:19:16,643 --> 00:19:18,873
Emergency!
Look out!

291
00:19:18,945 --> 00:19:21,505
I gotta catch a boat!
Look out!

292
00:19:30,157 --> 00:19:32,819
Out of my way!
Out of my way!

293
00:19:32,893 --> 00:19:35,191
Whoops!
Out of your way.

294
00:19:35,262 --> 00:19:38,595
Spread out boys, you're liable
to get blood all over you.

295
00:19:38,665 --> 00:19:41,099
Chester, whatever seems
to be the trouble?

296
00:19:41,168 --> 00:19:43,102
''Trouble,'' he says?
''Don't look back,'' he says?

297
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:46,970
I oughta--
Chester, don't fight this thing.
It's too big for you.

298
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:49,736
Like it says in the cards,
you're on your way to Alaska.
Huh?

299
00:19:52,913 --> 00:19:55,279
Alaska?
I'm goin' to New York!

300
00:19:55,348 --> 00:19:58,545
Stop the boat!
Wait!

301
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:01,988
What's goin'
on here?

302
00:20:02,055 --> 00:20:04,080
Alaska!
We're goin' to Alaska!

303
00:20:04,157 --> 00:20:06,352
He's gone, this boy--
The gold and everything,

304
00:20:06,426 --> 00:20:09,088
Don't listen to
that cheap phony.
I'm perfectly sane.

305
00:20:09,162 --> 00:20:12,131
Would a sane man go to Alaska
in a Palm Beach suit?

306
00:20:12,199 --> 00:20:15,566
I'm goin' to Brooklyn
to open a Turkish bath--
See what I mean?

307
00:20:15,635 --> 00:20:18,570
Take him to my cabin.
I've handled him before.

308
00:20:18,638 --> 00:20:21,436
I don't want to go to Alaska.
It's cold there!

309
00:20:21,508 --> 00:20:23,635
Icicles, popsicles,
Eskimo pies!

310
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:26,508
Take your hands off me.
Look, I'm sane.

311
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:29,549
2 and 2 is 4.
4 and 4 is 8.
8 and 8 is--

312
00:20:29,616 --> 00:20:31,709
[ Duke ]
Ahh.! Ahh.!

313
00:20:31,785 --> 00:20:34,481
Take me below.
He's gone.
We've lost this boy.

314
00:20:34,554 --> 00:20:37,455
You wouldn't do this
if I was in shape.

315
00:20:37,524 --> 00:20:40,550
You need any help,
just call us.
Stand by with a light mallet.

316
00:20:40,627 --> 00:20:42,720
Me on a boat to Alaska?
Maybe I am crazy.

317
00:20:42,796 --> 00:20:45,390
Chester--
Don't give me any talk,
just give me my money.

318
00:20:45,465 --> 00:20:48,025
Don't you think it would be better
if you let me hold the money?

319
00:20:48,101 --> 00:20:50,069
Give me that cabbage
before I part your derby.

320
00:20:50,137 --> 00:20:52,662
If that's the
way you feel--
That's the
way I feel.

321
00:20:52,739 --> 00:20:55,867
Is it all here?
Count it.
We gotta be careful.

322
00:20:55,942 --> 00:20:59,901
This is a strange boat.
There's a lot of crooks around.
You won't be lonesome.

323
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:03,416
You know way down underneath
I'm honest.
But on top,
you're a rat.

324
00:21:03,483 --> 00:21:06,611
That money would be
safer in my pocket.
You kiddin'?

325
00:21:06,686 --> 00:21:10,816
We're not putting the money
in your pocket or my pocket,

326
00:21:10,891 --> 00:21:15,954
we're puttin' it where
it belongs... in the safe.

327
00:21:16,029 --> 00:21:17,792
See?

328
00:21:17,864 --> 00:21:21,356
Man overboard!
Wait!

329
00:21:28,542 --> 00:21:31,477
No hard feelings?
No hard feelings.

330
00:21:31,545 --> 00:21:34,639
It's only money.
Has no
personality.

331
00:21:44,624 --> 00:21:48,492
You and those cards.
I can't understand.
Must've been a Pinochle deck.

332
00:21:48,562 --> 00:21:51,122
Keep scrubbin'!
Make it shine!

333
00:21:51,198 --> 00:21:53,632
Are you kiddin'?
My fingernails are all gone.

334
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:56,032
For the last hour I've been
using up the white meat.

335
00:21:56,102 --> 00:21:58,332
You'll keep on 'til you
work you way back to Frisco!

336
00:21:58,405 --> 00:22:02,398
Not me! I've had enough!
Me, too! Who do you think
you're pushin' around?

337
00:22:02,475 --> 00:22:04,500
We're not cattle,
you know!

338
00:22:04,578 --> 00:22:08,446
Moo!
Moo!

339
00:22:15,622 --> 00:22:17,920
Thanks.

340
00:22:20,293 --> 00:22:24,696
Baked ham around here.
Silly place
to get a hotfoot.

341
00:22:24,764 --> 00:22:27,597
Come on, help yourself.
This is no sailboat.

342
00:22:27,667 --> 00:22:30,636
I'm doing my share.
You look like an agent
standing there.

343
00:22:30,704 --> 00:22:33,696
That fire's important.
Makes the boat go.
That's right.

344
00:22:33,773 --> 00:22:35,741
Supposing
it goes out?
Supposing it does?

345
00:22:35,809 --> 00:22:38,937
I'm ready.
Oh, that's--

346
00:22:39,012 --> 00:22:42,175
Pardon me.
Thanks.

347
00:22:42,249 --> 00:22:44,717
What do you do
around here?
Nothing.

348
00:22:44,784 --> 00:22:47,344
You in this picture?
No, taking a short
cut to Stage 1 0.

349
00:23:10,343 --> 00:23:14,109
Very fine, Tony.
All right, who's next?

350
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:18,082
Let's go, Dad. You're on.
I'm not following
monkeys this season.

351
00:23:18,151 --> 00:23:20,415
They'll think it's an encore.
Besides, 1 0 bucks is 1 0 bucks.

352
00:23:20,487 --> 00:23:23,786
Don't be bashful.
Who's next?
Here's your boy.

353
00:23:23,857 --> 00:23:27,623
Stay in there.
Can I borrow that
Stomach Steinway?

354
00:23:27,694 --> 00:23:30,162
Take good care of him.
You kiddin'?
It's got asthma now.

355
00:23:32,399 --> 00:23:42,070
##

356
00:23:42,142 --> 00:23:46,101
#You think that money
is everything #

357
00:23:46,179 --> 00:23:49,342
#And yet it's
anybody's spring #

358
00:23:49,416 --> 00:23:53,682
# Go make a fortune
become a king #

359
00:23:53,753 --> 00:23:58,019
#And still it's
anybody's spring #

360
00:23:58,091 --> 00:24:01,390
#And if you
flash a bankroll #

361
00:24:01,461 --> 00:24:03,986
# Do you suppose
the brook would care #

362
00:24:04,064 --> 00:24:07,295
# Or that a rose would say #

363
00:24:07,367 --> 00:24:11,030
# ''There goes a millionaire'' #

364
00:24:12,272 --> 00:24:16,504
# It's more than diamonds
around a ring #

365
00:24:16,576 --> 00:24:20,137
# Because it's
anybody's spring #

366
00:24:20,213 --> 00:24:24,149
#You may be born with
the silver spoon #

367
00:24:24,217 --> 00:24:28,347
#And yet it's
anybody's moon #

368
00:24:28,421 --> 00:24:31,652
#You couldn't buy a ticket #

369
00:24:31,725 --> 00:24:35,354
#To hear the first robin sing #

370
00:24:35,428 --> 00:24:40,923
# It's free because it's
anybody's spring #

371
00:24:41,001 --> 00:24:51,570
##

372
00:24:51,644 --> 00:24:56,081
I never knew I could play
one of these.
You could
beat the monkey.

373
00:24:59,052 --> 00:25:02,351
#You couldn't
buy a ticket #

374
00:25:02,422 --> 00:25:05,949
#To hear the
first robin sing #

375
00:25:06,026 --> 00:25:11,760
# It's free because it's
anybody's spring ##

376
00:25:16,770 --> 00:25:19,000
Very nice.
Very nice.

377
00:25:19,072 --> 00:25:21,336
Now for the winner.
Line up here, please.

378
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:24,138
He's wasting time.
Naturally.

379
00:25:41,094 --> 00:25:43,824
Next time,
I bring Sinatra.

380
00:26:01,214 --> 00:26:05,617
Could you tell me where
I could find a Mr. Ace Larson?

381
00:26:05,685 --> 00:26:07,619
At his place,
I reckon--

382
00:26:07,687 --> 00:26:10,713
The Golden Rail.
Thank you.

383
00:26:16,996 --> 00:26:19,726
So I came up here as fast
as I could, Mr. Larson.

384
00:26:19,799 --> 00:26:23,462
If you'll only help me,
I'll be glad to pay you--
Pay me?

385
00:26:23,536 --> 00:26:28,166
You seem to forget, my dear,
your father was my best friend.
Thank you.

386
00:26:28,241 --> 00:26:30,766
Who did you say
stole that map?

387
00:26:30,844 --> 00:26:33,779
I didn't, but they were seen--
Two men, Sperry and McGurk.

388
00:26:33,847 --> 00:26:37,408
Sperry and McGurk, huh?

389
00:26:37,484 --> 00:26:40,146
You know them?
By reputation only.

390
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:43,280
Two of the blackest
cutthroats that ever
dirtied up the Klondike.

391
00:26:43,356 --> 00:26:46,257
- Maybe the police--
- That won't be necessary.

392
00:26:46,326 --> 00:26:49,227
Go down to the dock.
I want to know the minute
those two hit town.

393
00:26:51,097 --> 00:26:55,727
I can't begin to
thank you, Mr. Larson.
Forget it.

394
00:26:55,802 --> 00:26:57,895
What do you do?

395
00:26:57,971 --> 00:27:02,135
I beg your pardon?
For your living.
How do you get by?

396
00:27:02,208 --> 00:27:04,403
I sing a little.

397
00:27:05,945 --> 00:27:08,209
I like that.

398
00:27:08,281 --> 00:27:10,306
From now on,
you'll work for me.

399
00:27:11,618 --> 00:27:14,246
Now don't you worry your
pretty little head about it.

400
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:17,346
Just leave everything to me.
You've been
terribly sweet.

401
00:27:17,423 --> 00:27:22,156
The dirty dog. He just
wants to get Dorothy into
one of those scanty costumes.

402
00:27:22,228 --> 00:27:23,923
Not a
bad idea.

403
00:27:23,997 --> 00:27:27,797
I'm working
for Mr. Larson--
Upstairs.

404
00:27:27,867 --> 00:27:30,097
Thank you.

405
00:27:36,042 --> 00:27:37,737
Who's the
fancy baggage?

406
00:27:37,810 --> 00:27:40,108
A little lady who's
lost a gold mine.

407
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:44,674
Are you the lost and found
department?
I'm gonna help
her get it back.

408
00:27:44,751 --> 00:27:48,687
Aren't you stepping
a little out of character?
I don't know.

409
00:27:48,755 --> 00:27:51,189
The mine's worth about
three million dollars.

410
00:27:51,257 --> 00:27:55,591
What do we get
out of it?
About three
million dollars.

411
00:27:58,831 --> 00:28:01,766
Doesn't leave the
''little lady'' much, does it?

412
00:28:01,834 --> 00:28:06,203
That's what I like about you.
You're good at arithmetic.

413
00:28:08,741 --> 00:28:12,768
The boat docks in Skagway
but are we getting off?

414
00:28:12,845 --> 00:28:16,872
Oh, no, we're cooked.
I didn't want
to get on this boat.

415
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:19,976
I was Shangri-La'd.
Shanghaied,
old man.

416
00:28:20,053 --> 00:28:21,987
Well, one of those
towns in Egypt.

417
00:28:28,361 --> 00:28:30,955
What do you
got there?

418
00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:33,794
Just an old piece of paper,
that's all.

419
00:28:33,866 --> 00:28:36,334
What're you puttin' it
in your pocket for?

420
00:28:36,402 --> 00:28:38,996
I save old paper.
Some people save old string.

421
00:28:39,072 --> 00:28:41,233
I think folding
is more fun than twisting.

422
00:28:41,307 --> 00:28:44,606
What is it?
Just a map
of an old gold mine.

423
00:28:44,677 --> 00:28:47,669
What?
Just a little one. Good for
a couple of inlays maybe.

424
00:28:47,747 --> 00:28:50,181
Let's see it.
I'm an old map man.

425
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:52,309
It's my
type of work.

426
00:28:54,621 --> 00:28:58,523
Chester, you realize
what this is?
It's a map.

427
00:28:58,591 --> 00:29:02,391
It's the Van Hoyden gold mine.
You read the papers.
You think so?

428
00:29:02,462 --> 00:29:05,260
The guys that have this room
must be the killers.
Dirty rats.

429
00:29:05,331 --> 00:29:07,993
[ Duke ]
We got the map. It's ours.
How do you figure?

430
00:29:08,067 --> 00:29:11,195
The law of the Yukon--
Possession.
How 'bout the murderers?

431
00:29:11,271 --> 00:29:13,432
We'll turn them
over to the cops.

432
00:29:13,506 --> 00:29:17,135
- They should be boiled in oil.
- I told you... a gold mine.!

433
00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:19,974
I saw it in the cards.
Those beautiful cards.

434
00:29:20,046 --> 00:29:23,038
Riding down 5th Avenue.
Throwing 50-dollar bills
at the round haircuts.

435
00:29:23,116 --> 00:29:26,552
We'll be
living like kings.
Living like kings?

436
00:29:26,619 --> 00:29:28,519
I abdicate.

437
00:29:28,588 --> 00:29:31,523
Nice little mine
you got here, fellas.

438
00:29:31,591 --> 00:29:34,992
Wear it in
good health, boys.
Nice to meet you.

439
00:29:35,061 --> 00:29:37,859
Come on, Chester.
We got a little dust
of our own to take care of.

440
00:29:37,930 --> 00:29:40,899
Start cleaning up here.
That blood.

441
00:29:40,967 --> 00:29:43,367
There's no
blood there.
There's gonna be.

442
00:29:43,436 --> 00:29:45,301
No noise.
You wanna wake up
the neighborhood?

443
00:29:45,371 --> 00:29:47,896
This is much better.

444
00:29:47,974 --> 00:29:50,841
Yeah? I ain't
afraid to die.

445
00:29:50,910 --> 00:29:53,538
I just hate
being killed.

446
00:29:54,981 --> 00:29:58,212
Wait a minute.
Think it over.
For a couple of years.

447
00:29:58,284 --> 00:30:02,380
You wouldn't want to dirty
a nice knife over a stale
couple of million bucks.!

448
00:30:02,455 --> 00:30:04,514
What do we do now?
Remember Schenectady?

449
00:30:05,725 --> 00:30:08,421
Okay fellas,
we're ready.

450
00:30:08,494 --> 00:30:11,327
We ain't askin'
for no mercy.
Can we say
our prayers?

451
00:30:11,397 --> 00:30:14,560
Okay.
Be quick about it.

452
00:30:23,810 --> 00:30:27,177
Bailey...
Crawford.
Bailey...
Crawford.

453
00:30:27,246 --> 00:30:29,942
No trace of those
stowaways, sir.
I ain't worried.

454
00:30:30,016 --> 00:30:32,576
If they're gettin' off, they've
got to come through here.

455
00:30:32,652 --> 00:30:34,586
Flannery.
Flannery.

456
00:30:34,654 --> 00:30:36,679
peters.
peters.

457
00:30:59,812 --> 00:31:01,746
Lombardi.
Lombardi.

458
00:31:01,814 --> 00:31:03,748
Sperry.
And McGurk.

459
00:31:03,816 --> 00:31:06,148
Sperry and McGurk.
Sperry and McGurk?

460
00:31:09,188 --> 00:31:14,057
Yeah, Sperry and McGurk.
What about it, partner?
What about it?

461
00:31:14,127 --> 00:31:17,119
Nothing, boys. Only,
just don't make any trouble.

462
00:31:17,196 --> 00:31:20,131
Things are different
since you boys were here.
It's nice and peaceful.

463
00:31:20,199 --> 00:31:23,691
Don't worry, we're
law-abiding citizens now.

464
00:31:23,770 --> 00:31:26,170
Anybody says we ain't,
we'll plug 'em.

465
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:37,376
Hey, Sperry and McGurk
just hit town.

466
00:31:37,450 --> 00:31:40,385
Sperry and McGurk?
Yeah, and they're
headed this way.

467
00:31:40,453 --> 00:31:42,580
Here they
come now!

468
00:32:00,706 --> 00:32:02,901
What goes with
the local peasantry?

469
00:32:02,975 --> 00:32:05,205
One look at us and they
run right out of the joint.

470
00:32:05,278 --> 00:32:07,439
I feel like I'm
back in vaudeville.

471
00:32:07,513 --> 00:32:10,004
I don't know what Sperry
and McGurk did to this burg,

472
00:32:10,082 --> 00:32:13,108
but they're dynamite.
We own this town.

473
00:32:13,186 --> 00:32:15,586
I'll sell cheap.
I don't like it.

474
00:32:15,655 --> 00:32:17,589
If those hoodlums ever
get off that boat,

475
00:32:17,657 --> 00:32:19,887
we'll be smiling from ear
to ear with our throats.
Forget it.

476
00:32:19,959 --> 00:32:23,918
The town's ours-- Food,
liquor, supplies, anything.
All we got to do is act tough.

477
00:32:23,996 --> 00:32:27,932
Tough?
Remember, you're Sperry
and I'm McGurk.

478
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,867
Got it?
Got it.

479
00:32:30,937 --> 00:32:35,271
Made it.
Not quite.
It's a leaner.

480
00:32:35,341 --> 00:32:39,835
What'd I tell ya?
We got the royal suite,
dinner, liquor,

481
00:32:39,912 --> 00:32:42,676
sled loaded with
a month's supplies.

482
00:32:42,748 --> 00:32:46,946
Hasn't cost us a dime.
Clamber out of that beaver.

483
00:32:47,019 --> 00:32:49,317
How'll they know we're
Sperry and McGurk?
We'll tell 'em.

484
00:32:49,388 --> 00:32:51,720
If those two butchers
ever get off that boat,

485
00:32:51,791 --> 00:32:53,759
we'll wind up hamburger,
blood-rare.

486
00:32:53,826 --> 00:32:55,760
I don't like it.
You don't like it?

487
00:32:55,828 --> 00:32:57,887
You don't know a good thing
when you see it.

488
00:32:57,964 --> 00:33:00,831
This town's a whole
big jackpot for us.
I don't like it.

489
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:03,368
Skagway Sal wants
to see you boys.

490
00:33:03,436 --> 00:33:06,530
I'm beginning
to like it.
Get out of here!

491
00:33:06,606 --> 00:33:08,506
We got business.
Who'd you say?

492
00:33:08,574 --> 00:33:10,701
Skagway Sal.

493
00:33:10,776 --> 00:33:13,438
Well, come on in.
That's our business.

494
00:33:13,513 --> 00:33:16,812
Where does, uh--
hang out?
Golden Rail.

495
00:33:16,883 --> 00:33:18,908
Looky here,
Skunky.

496
00:33:18,985 --> 00:33:22,079
Anybody ever see Sperry and
McGurk with their beards off?

497
00:33:22,154 --> 00:33:24,088
Not that I know of.

498
00:33:24,156 --> 00:33:27,887
Spread the news around.
They're gonna see it tonight.
Okay.

499
00:33:37,637 --> 00:33:40,071
Skagway Sal, let's go.
Now they're furnishing dates.

500
00:33:40,139 --> 00:33:43,108
This is a great town.
We're beginning to operate.

501
00:33:43,175 --> 00:33:47,009
Sal's waitin'.
What's the rush?
There's only one dame.

502
00:33:47,079 --> 00:33:50,412
You better clamber out of
that mattress before somebody
asks you for a cough drop.

503
00:33:50,483 --> 00:33:53,577
You better let
me hold the map.
What for?

504
00:33:53,653 --> 00:33:55,678
You know how you act when
you get around women.

505
00:33:55,755 --> 00:33:57,723
The only thing I do is
get ''around'' the women.

506
00:33:57,790 --> 00:34:00,122
Give me the map.
Don't forget,
half s mine.

507
00:34:00,192 --> 00:34:02,752
Half of it's yours.
Here you are.

508
00:34:02,828 --> 00:34:06,229
What're you doing?
Putting mine in my
hat in a safe place.

509
00:34:06,299 --> 00:34:09,166
You'd better do
the same thing.
In a safe
place, huh?

510
00:34:09,235 --> 00:34:12,762
What do you think
of my underwear?
Not much,
but put it there.

511
00:34:17,343 --> 00:34:20,972
Throw that
candy away.
I got a sweet tooth.

512
00:34:21,047 --> 00:34:25,108
We're supposed to be killers...
supposed to look tough.
The almonds are tough.

513
00:34:25,184 --> 00:34:27,982
Lose it.
Throw it away.
Stash it.

514
00:34:28,054 --> 00:34:32,582
Here, Fuzzy.
Dessert? Come on.

515
00:34:32,658 --> 00:34:35,183
When you get to an elbow,
it's mine.
Are you crazy?

516
00:34:35,261 --> 00:34:37,786
Feedin' a loose pooch?
We'll never get rid of him.

517
00:34:37,863 --> 00:34:40,661
He's a cute character.
Let's take him along.
He's as big as a horse.

518
00:34:40,733 --> 00:34:43,702
Probably eats like a horse.
That runs into a lot of money.

519
00:34:43,769 --> 00:34:46,670
You oughta know.
Come on.

520
00:34:46,739 --> 00:34:48,934
Remember, we're supposed
to be Sperry and McGurk.

521
00:34:49,008 --> 00:34:51,203
Tough, huh?
Very tough.

522
00:34:51,277 --> 00:34:53,507
Scat, sad sack.
Go on, scat.

523
00:34:53,579 --> 00:34:55,945
Beat it before he
throws a saddle on you.

524
00:35:23,509 --> 00:35:25,807
There they are!

525
00:35:31,083 --> 00:35:33,347
How tough could
these guys have been?

526
00:35:41,694 --> 00:35:44,458
Okay, everybody, go ahead
and enjoy yourselves.

527
00:35:44,530 --> 00:35:47,226
We ain't in
a killin' mood tonight.

528
00:35:50,102 --> 00:35:52,536
Just
a woundin' mood.

529
00:35:52,605 --> 00:35:56,371
Let's get some action here.
We're springin' tonight.

530
00:35:56,442 --> 00:36:00,606
Champagne
for the crowd.

531
00:36:03,916 --> 00:36:07,249
That's enough.
We're the crowd.

532
00:36:10,723 --> 00:36:15,422
At this point the plot is
much more interesting from
your point of view than mine.

533
00:36:30,376 --> 00:36:33,539
This is the life,
Pappy.
This is awful.

534
00:36:33,612 --> 00:36:36,206
What's the matter?
I ain't got
room for her.

535
00:36:36,282 --> 00:36:39,809
I wish I had another leg.
What happens when Sal shows up?

536
00:36:39,885 --> 00:36:43,286
She'll have to sign
an application blank.
We may get to her later.

537
00:36:47,493 --> 00:36:51,725

# She had a well-developed

Well, duty calls.
I'll see you later.
What do you mean?

566
00:38:35,034 --> 00:38:38,003
You saw her makin' with those eyes,
givin' me that come hither.

567
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:39,765
Givin' you that
come hither?
Yes.

568
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:41,670
Where
you goin'?
Thither.

569
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:45,141
You're not ''nither.'' She was
giving me the same business.

570
00:38:45,211 --> 00:38:48,374
This gal's been around.
Takes a lad like me to handle her.
Like you?

571
00:38:48,447 --> 00:38:51,109
Experience is
the best teacher.
The best teacher?

572
00:38:51,183 --> 00:38:54,550
And I'm a PhD.
That's Pinheaded Dope.
Einstein--

573
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:56,645
Here comes the waiter
with the check.

574
00:38:56,722 --> 00:38:58,986
Which one of you
two fellas is Sperry?

575
00:39:06,465 --> 00:39:10,492
Experience is the
best teacher, huh?

576
00:39:10,569 --> 00:39:13,663
Don't wait up for me.
I may have to stay after school.

577
00:39:16,842 --> 00:39:19,174
That poor little lamb.

578
00:39:19,245 --> 00:39:21,338
All right, girls,
everybody back!

579
00:39:21,413 --> 00:39:26,009
Work fast. As soon as we
get the map, Ace is headin'
for his place up at Dawson.

580
00:39:26,085 --> 00:39:29,748
You sure they're the right men?
They don't look like killers.

581
00:39:29,822 --> 00:39:33,053
We're going to
a lot of trouble on this.
Don't make it tougher.

582
00:39:33,125 --> 00:39:35,821
I appreciate--

583
00:39:35,895 --> 00:39:39,831
You wanna get your mine,
don't you? Leave it to Ace.

584
00:39:39,899 --> 00:39:42,129
He told you
to get that map.

585
00:39:42,201 --> 00:39:44,635
He ain't particular
how you get it.

586
00:39:47,907 --> 00:39:49,807
Come in.

587
00:39:53,045 --> 00:39:55,843
Well, here I am.
Start burning the incense.

588
00:39:55,915 --> 00:39:57,610
Come in.

589
00:40:00,753 --> 00:40:05,520
Well,
here we are.
Yes,
here we are.

590
00:40:05,591 --> 00:40:09,322
Well?
Well?

591
00:40:09,395 --> 00:40:11,420
Care to shoot
a game of pool?

592
00:40:11,497 --> 00:40:15,433
I'm glad I waited, Sperry.
Everything they said
about you is true.

593
00:40:15,501 --> 00:40:18,993
I can only love a killer
and you've got ''killer''
written all over you.

594
00:40:19,071 --> 00:40:23,474
Those shifty eyes,
that weak chin--
Camouflage.

595
00:40:23,542 --> 00:40:26,010
How many men have
you killed this week?

596
00:40:26,078 --> 00:40:28,979
Just 40 or 50. I've been
in a pretty good mood.

597
00:40:29,048 --> 00:40:32,643
Let's not talk shop.
It seems to me
we've met somewhere before.

598
00:40:32,718 --> 00:40:35,949
I don't think so.
Perhaps
in your dreams.

599
00:40:36,021 --> 00:40:38,012
You wouldn't be seen
in those kind of places.

600
00:40:38,090 --> 00:40:43,494
Some women can love
any type of man, but not me.
I've got to have a beast.

601
00:40:43,562 --> 00:40:46,725
Is a wolf
considered a beast?

602
00:40:46,799 --> 00:40:48,960
My, what
a fiery nature.

603
00:40:49,034 --> 00:40:51,502
Let's throw
another log on it.

604
00:40:54,573 --> 00:40:58,168
As far as I'm concerned,
this picture's over right now.

605
00:40:58,243 --> 00:41:01,804
Oh, Sperry!
Never leave me,
Sal, you'll suffer.

606
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:04,110
Not for anything
in the world.

607
00:41:04,183 --> 00:41:07,380
Not even if they
offered me... a gold mine.

608
00:41:07,453 --> 00:41:09,546
Gold mine?

609
00:41:09,621 --> 00:41:14,684
Money doesn't matter to me.
I don't care how poor you are.

610
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:16,785
You mean that,
don't you?

611
00:41:16,862 --> 00:41:18,989
You've got nothing
to worry about.

612
00:41:24,269 --> 00:41:26,260
Shh!
I'm loaded.

613
00:41:26,338 --> 00:41:28,898
Loaded?
Gold mine
with nuggets.

614
00:41:28,974 --> 00:41:31,169
Sperry,
don't be facetious.

615
00:41:31,243 --> 00:41:34,178
Keep politics out of this.
I have the biggest
gold mine in Alaska.

616
00:41:34,246 --> 00:41:36,339
It's ours...
yours and mine.

617
00:41:36,415 --> 00:41:39,680
What about your partner?
Porky?
Just a stooge.

618
00:41:39,752 --> 00:41:42,744
Once we get that map off
of him, we're rollin'.

619
00:41:42,821 --> 00:41:45,483
He's got the map?
Don't worry. I'll get
it when he's asleep.

620
00:41:45,557 --> 00:41:48,993
Where does he keep it?
Sorry, we don't tell anyone,
we're no fools.

621
00:41:49,061 --> 00:41:52,087
Not even me?
Not even you.

622
00:41:52,164 --> 00:41:56,362
I hope it's in a safe place.
Who'd ever think of
looking in his hat?

623
00:41:56,435 --> 00:41:59,461
We're not amateurs,
you know.
I can see that.

624
00:41:59,538 --> 00:42:02,336
It's getting late,
you'd better run along.

625
00:42:02,408 --> 00:42:05,206
What's the rush?
I've got another
show to do.

626
00:42:05,277 --> 00:42:08,007
But I just
got here.
I said, later.

627
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:10,674
Midnight,
my apartment?

628
00:42:10,749 --> 00:42:13,912
Supper?
I'm not hungry.

629
00:42:20,726 --> 00:42:22,660
I'll go work up
an appetite.

630
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:37,765
Come in.

631
00:42:39,278 --> 00:42:42,304
You can take the lantern
out of the window, Sal gal.

632
00:42:42,381 --> 00:42:45,179
The mighty McGurk is home.
Sit down.
Make yourself cozy.

633
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:48,185
I don't mind
if I do.

634
00:42:49,221 --> 00:42:52,679
Well, this is
more like it.

635
00:42:52,758 --> 00:42:57,286
Seems like they sent you
the wrong boy.
I asked
for McGurk.

636
00:42:57,362 --> 00:43:00,058
You must've
spelled it with a ''J''.

637
00:43:00,132 --> 00:43:03,533
I knew you'd come to
your senses sooner or later.

638
00:43:03,602 --> 00:43:06,594
They all do.
It's not hard
to understand.

639
00:43:06,672 --> 00:43:10,073
Where're
you goin'?
Cigarette.

640
00:43:10,142 --> 00:43:12,838
You've got one.
I have,
haven't I?

641
00:43:12,911 --> 00:43:16,574
I guess I'm a little mixed up.
See what you do to me?

642
00:43:16,648 --> 00:43:19,879
You can't help yourself, babe.
You just joined the club.

643
00:43:19,952 --> 00:43:22,546
Must have quite
a membership.
Coast to coast.

644
00:43:22,621 --> 00:43:25,613
We can always squeeze
in a new member.

645
00:43:25,691 --> 00:43:26,988
You're quite a panic with
the ladies, aren't you?

646
00:43:27,059 --> 00:43:30,358
I'm murder when
I make my move.

647
00:43:31,697 --> 00:43:33,562
Tell me,

648
00:43:33,632 --> 00:43:37,500
how do
you do it?

649
00:43:37,569 --> 00:43:42,632
It's the usual routine;
flowers, Sunday dinner
at home with the folks,

650
00:43:42,708 --> 00:43:47,577
a ride in the park,
sing a little song and uh--

651
00:43:47,646 --> 00:43:49,580
Sing a little song.

652
00:43:49,648 --> 00:43:53,744
The song does it?
It sort of limbers
them up a little.

653
00:43:53,819 --> 00:43:56,014
That song may be
just what we need here.

654
00:43:56,088 --> 00:43:59,854
Baby, you and me
don't need no scales.
Come on.

655
00:43:59,925 --> 00:44:02,359
You're not
going anywhere.

656
00:44:04,196 --> 00:44:08,155
There's the piano.
Let's hear you practice
what you preach.

657
00:44:10,969 --> 00:44:17,374
##

658
00:44:17,442 --> 00:44:21,071
#Welcome
to my dream #

659
00:44:21,146 --> 00:44:25,810
#And how are you #

660
00:44:25,884 --> 00:44:29,376
#Will you
be here long #

661
00:44:29,454 --> 00:44:33,584
# Or just
passin' through #

662
00:44:33,659 --> 00:44:38,596
# Brush off
that stardust #

663
00:44:38,664 --> 00:44:41,462
#Where have
you been #

664
00:44:42,868 --> 00:44:46,736
#Don't tell me
your rainbow #

665
00:44:46,805 --> 00:44:50,798
#Was late gettin' in #

666
00:44:53,345 --> 00:44:57,213
#Welcome to my dream #

667
00:44:57,282 --> 00:45:00,649
# It now seems real #

668
00:45:02,154 --> 00:45:05,817
# You're what
it needed #

669
00:45:05,891 --> 00:45:09,793
# To make it ideal #

670
00:45:09,861 --> 00:45:14,662
# So glad you got here #

671
00:45:14,733 --> 00:45:18,760
# I hope you can stay #

672
00:45:20,405 --> 00:45:23,272
# But welcome
to my dream #

673
00:45:23,342 --> 00:45:31,442
#Anyway ##

674
00:45:42,928 --> 00:45:46,193
What's the matter, gal?
Want another chorus?
Later.

675
00:45:46,265 --> 00:45:49,632
Later?
Midnight,
my apartment?

676
00:45:49,701 --> 00:45:51,862
What for?
I'm here now.

677
00:45:51,937 --> 00:45:56,203
A cozy little supper?
I'm not ''hongry.''

678
00:45:58,110 --> 00:46:00,044
I'll go work up
an appetite.

679
00:46:02,014 --> 00:46:04,949
Hope just said
that line, didn't he?

680
00:46:05,017 --> 00:46:08,043
Why should he get
all the laughs?

681
00:46:21,533 --> 00:46:25,128
Here it is.
Nice work, Miss Van Hoyden.
You know what to do.

682
00:46:25,203 --> 00:46:29,503
Keep 'em here in town.
Give me 48 hours. I'll stake out
the claim and bring papers.

683
00:46:29,574 --> 00:46:31,701
I don't know how
to thank you.

684
00:46:31,777 --> 00:46:34,337
Forget it. We're only
too happy to take care of you.

685
00:46:34,413 --> 00:46:36,973
You be careful. You've got
a couple of bad boys there.

686
00:46:37,049 --> 00:46:39,984
I'll handle Mr. Sperry
and Mr. McGurk.

687
00:46:40,052 --> 00:46:43,453
All right,
mush!

688
00:46:45,757 --> 00:46:48,726
So you finally got
yourself a date?
You said it.

689
00:46:48,794 --> 00:46:50,921
You pick up
a lonely walrus?

690
00:46:50,996 --> 00:46:52,964
You know I don't cut
into your territory.

691
00:46:53,031 --> 00:46:55,864
You know that school of
experience? I enrolled.

692
00:46:55,934 --> 00:46:59,335
Tonight I take my
first exam... in cooking.

693
00:46:59,404 --> 00:47:02,100
Never pass. I have
a date with teacher.

694
00:47:02,174 --> 00:47:04,506
That's fine. I like--
What do you mean?

695
00:47:04,576 --> 00:47:07,204
Midnight, supper,
her apartment.

696
00:47:07,279 --> 00:47:10,976
I shall be there.
Doing what, waiting on tables?
That supper's for Chester.

697
00:47:11,049 --> 00:47:13,711
Listen, fatter-than-me,
you're over-matching yourself.

698
00:47:13,785 --> 00:47:17,186
She made the date with me.
Why would she make a date with
two guys at the same time?

699
00:47:17,255 --> 00:47:19,348
Why not?

700
00:47:20,926 --> 00:47:24,885
How about that? This youth
says you made a date with him.

701
00:47:24,963 --> 00:47:28,194
Yes, I did.
You're darn right.

702
00:47:28,266 --> 00:47:30,791
You invited me.
You sellin' tickets?

703
00:47:30,869 --> 00:47:36,705
I like both of you so much,
and Sperry and McGurk always
work together as a team.

704
00:47:36,775 --> 00:47:39,335
Not on everything, we don't.

705
00:47:39,411 --> 00:47:42,710
Let's go downstairs
and talk this over.

706
00:47:44,716 --> 00:47:47,583
Who was it that said,
''Two's company, three's a crowd?

707
00:47:47,652 --> 00:47:49,950
Wasn't he silly?
Yes.
Yes.

708
00:47:50,021 --> 00:47:54,481
I see no reason why
a girl can't have a
good time with two fellas.

709
00:47:54,559 --> 00:47:56,857
As long as one's
her grandfather.

710
00:47:56,928 --> 00:47:59,192
You don't
look that old.

711
00:48:03,705 --> 00:48:05,696
So long, Sal.
Nice knowin' you.

712
00:48:05,774 --> 00:48:07,765
Where you going?
North to cool off.

713
00:48:07,842 --> 00:48:10,208
Don't you have
to have a map?
I got my half.

714
00:48:10,278 --> 00:48:12,212
I got my half.
Half?

715
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:14,214
I'll see you
when we get back.

716
00:48:14,282 --> 00:48:16,079
Sled's outside.
Let's get our coats and blow.

717
00:48:18,887 --> 00:48:22,345
Where are they?
21 8.

718
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:34,428
What a blizzard!
We should've put on
some warm clothes.

719
00:48:34,502 --> 00:48:38,165
Hope there's no
bear hunters around.
Mine's still alive.

720
00:48:39,741 --> 00:48:42,301
Where do you step
on the starter?
No starter?

721
00:48:42,377 --> 00:48:45,210
Must be last
year's model.
It's a dog sled!

722
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:48,272
We'll pull
it ourselves.
Not me!
In a blizzard?

723
00:48:48,349 --> 00:48:50,283
Are you mad?
We're not dogs, you know.

724
00:49:03,498 --> 00:49:06,956
I've got to get a sled.
No dogs till tomorrow.

725
00:49:07,035 --> 00:49:11,301
Will you have any by daybreak?
I've got to get away.

726
00:49:18,313 --> 00:49:22,181
Here we are,
off on another road!
And what a road!

727
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:24,912
Case those trees,
that snow, that scenery!

728
00:49:24,986 --> 00:49:28,217
And get a load
of that bread and butter.

729
00:49:28,289 --> 00:49:31,690
Bread and butter?
That's a mountain.!

730
00:49:33,995 --> 00:49:38,455
May be a mountain to you,
but it's bread and butter to me.
Well, keep it shady.

731
00:49:40,568 --> 00:49:43,059
I'm in a hurry.
Think you can
handle it?

732
00:49:43,137 --> 00:49:47,096
Handle it!
I was raised up here. Mush!

733
00:49:50,678 --> 00:49:53,579
# I don't care
where I'm going #

734
00:49:53,648 --> 00:49:56,208
#Just as long
as I'm with you #

735
00:49:56,284 --> 00:50:00,880
# Put it there, pal
put it there #

736
00:50:00,955 --> 00:50:05,392
I saw ''Let's Face It.''
And I saw ''Dixie'' too.

737
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:09,829
# Put it there, pal
put it there #

738
00:50:09,898 --> 00:50:12,298
#This country's
full of wolves #

739
00:50:12,367 --> 00:50:14,392
# But you should make
'em laughingstocks #

740
00:50:14,469 --> 00:50:16,437
#The girls are fond
of blubber #

741
00:50:16,504 --> 00:50:18,802
#And the igloos
have no locks #

742
00:50:18,873 --> 00:50:22,707
#You'll wow the lady Eskimos
They don't wear bobby socks #

743
00:50:22,777 --> 00:50:25,211
#You're so faithful
and so fair #

744
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:27,612
Hit me with
your biscuit hook.
Coming with some hot skin!

745
00:50:27,682 --> 00:50:32,312
#You've got that something
in your voice so right
for selling cheese #

746
00:50:32,387 --> 00:50:37,017
# Put it there, pal
put it there #

747
00:50:37,091 --> 00:50:39,218
I think your jokes
are great.
Do you?

748
00:50:39,294 --> 00:50:41,660
It's just folks
are hard to please.
Yeah.

749
00:50:41,729 --> 00:50:45,961
Your hand, sir.
Put that back
in the bowl.

750
00:50:46,034 --> 00:50:50,596
#Your face could make
a fortune just your nose
should make a lot #

751
00:50:50,672 --> 00:50:52,606
# I like the way
you wear #

752
00:50:52,674 --> 00:50:55,268
#Those gaudy-colored
shirts you've got #

753
00:50:55,343 --> 00:50:59,541
#The only time a rainbow
ever covered up a pot #

754
00:50:59,614 --> 00:51:01,673
#We make
a perfect pair #

755
00:51:01,749 --> 00:51:04,240
# Put it there #

756
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:06,583
My colleague.
My cohort.
My crony
my friend.

757
00:51:06,654 --> 00:51:08,815
Companions.
Chums to the end.
Confederates.

758
00:51:08,890 --> 00:51:11,450
Like meat
and potatoes.
Or salt and tomatoes.

759
00:51:11,526 --> 00:51:13,391
# Boy what a blend #

760
00:51:13,461 --> 00:51:17,557
# Don't put it in the paper
Don't put it on the air #

761
00:51:17,632 --> 00:51:21,261
# Don't put it on the shelf
put it there #

762
00:51:35,083 --> 00:51:37,950
Look who's here!
Santa Claus!

763
00:51:38,019 --> 00:51:40,317
Say, there must be
a department store around here.

764
00:51:40,388 --> 00:51:44,950
Well, well!
Chester and Duke.

765
00:51:45,026 --> 00:51:47,790
Whoa!
Ha-ha-ha-ha.

766
00:51:47,862 --> 00:51:50,456
Got your Christmas
presents right here.

767
00:51:50,531 --> 00:51:54,194
On your way, Fatso.
Think we're gonna fall
for that kid stuff?

768
00:51:54,268 --> 00:51:57,135
You mean you don't believe
in Santa Claus?

769
00:51:57,205 --> 00:52:00,641
What do you think we are?
Children? Infants?
Babies?

770
00:52:00,708 --> 00:52:03,472
Very well.
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

771
00:52:03,544 --> 00:52:07,708
I'll just give 'em
to somebody else.

772
00:52:09,817 --> 00:52:12,752
You'll be sorry!

773
00:52:35,176 --> 00:52:39,476
Half a map! I let
two-bit hoodlums cross me up.

774
00:52:39,547 --> 00:52:41,481
I didn't give 'em
much credit.

775
00:52:41,549 --> 00:52:44,712
Maybe our nightingale
is holding out.
That's all she got.

776
00:52:44,786 --> 00:52:47,949
I'll get
the other half--
No, you don't!

777
00:52:48,022 --> 00:52:51,753
I'm not going to tangle
with the Mounties.

778
00:52:51,826 --> 00:52:53,623
Van Hoyden
got half the map.

779
00:52:53,695 --> 00:52:56,357
Let her get the other.
Suppose I go help
her out?

780
00:52:56,431 --> 00:52:58,729
Yeah! I like that.

781
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:02,429
I don't!
I'm running this show.
You'll both go.

782
00:53:02,503 --> 00:53:06,098
We'll give Kate a chance.
If that doesn't work,
then you take over.

783
00:53:09,410 --> 00:53:11,207
Whoa!

784
00:53:11,279 --> 00:53:13,804
Whoa!

785
00:53:16,818 --> 00:53:18,877
Let's go down
and get them.

786
00:53:18,953 --> 00:53:21,820
You know what Ace said.
We try Kate's way first.

787
00:53:21,889 --> 00:53:25,052
McKenzie's cabin's there.
You understand?

788
00:53:25,126 --> 00:53:29,290
Give me till
tomorrow morning.
We'll be waiting here.

789
00:53:33,367 --> 00:53:36,302
And I was gonna
open a Turkish bath!

790
00:53:36,370 --> 00:53:40,739
You had to feed
that monster!
And you had
to bring me to Alaska!

791
00:53:40,808 --> 00:53:43,208
You should
quit grousin'!

792
00:53:43,277 --> 00:53:46,644
You shoulda worn
ear muffs.
What for?
My ears fell off an hour ago.

793
00:53:46,714 --> 00:53:49,239
We find that mine,
you'll be a rich man.

794
00:53:49,317 --> 00:53:52,184
My hands are frozen, my feet,
everything's frozen!

795
00:53:52,253 --> 00:53:55,916
You'll be sittin'
on top of the world!
Everything's frozen!

796
00:53:59,927 --> 00:54:02,828
My nose is like
an icicle!

797
00:54:02,897 --> 00:54:05,889
Icicle?
That's a glacier!

798
00:54:05,967 --> 00:54:08,265
Hey, look!

799
00:54:08,336 --> 00:54:12,204
A pedestrian!
Huh!

800
00:54:12,273 --> 00:54:15,606
It's a dame!
A dame?
You kidding?

801
00:54:15,676 --> 00:54:18,236
What would a dame
be doing up here?
It could be Sonja Henie.

802
00:54:18,312 --> 00:54:22,840
Lemme see her.
Nothing doing. I found her.
Find one for yourself!

803
00:54:27,355 --> 00:54:30,290
Say,
she ain't bad.
Is she alive?

804
00:54:30,358 --> 00:54:33,919
Don't make no difference.
She's still mine.

805
00:54:33,995 --> 00:54:36,293
Ha-ha,
she's alive!
Pick her up.
She's frozen.

806
00:54:36,364 --> 00:54:39,458
I'd hate to be around
when she thaws out.

807
00:54:39,534 --> 00:54:41,866
Goldilocks, let's get
out of this frappe.

808
00:54:41,936 --> 00:54:44,336
Let me help.
Okay, but
don't enjoy it.

809
00:54:44,405 --> 00:54:47,340
No fuel shortage
for us.
I got my
little stove.

810
00:54:47,408 --> 00:54:49,638
Look who's here.

811
00:54:49,710 --> 00:54:51,541
What are you
doing here?

812
00:54:51,612 --> 00:54:54,308
We had a little date,
remember?

813
00:54:54,382 --> 00:54:56,873
Nobody stands up
Skagway Sal.
You've got me wrong.

814
00:54:56,951 --> 00:55:01,320
Who'd want to?
I've got my little stove now.

815
00:55:01,389 --> 00:55:04,483
Ahh, cabin...
over there.

816
00:55:04,559 --> 00:55:06,652
Get her to
the cabin fast.

817
00:55:06,727 --> 00:55:09,321
Buster, put your stove on
the sled and we'll run along.

818
00:55:09,397 --> 00:55:14,858
What are you gonna do?
We'd better start...
warming things up.

819
00:55:14,936 --> 00:55:16,995
That's how it stands.

820
00:55:17,071 --> 00:55:19,335
Either we get that map
off Sperry...

821
00:55:19,407 --> 00:55:21,841
or those butchers'll
be down in the morning.

822
00:55:21,909 --> 00:55:25,003
That's liable
to be a bit messy.

823
00:55:25,079 --> 00:55:28,708
Murder?
I believe that's
the word for it.

824
00:55:32,353 --> 00:55:35,254
Woop! Woop!
Ha-ha-ha!

825
00:55:35,323 --> 00:55:37,723
This is jolly,jolly.

826
00:55:37,792 --> 00:55:41,387
Snug-warm cabins,
congenial companions.

827
00:55:41,462 --> 00:55:44,556
Yes, sir! Doing
grand, grand, grand.

828
00:55:44,632 --> 00:55:47,601
I'd consider Sal showing up
quite a coincidence...

829
00:55:47,668 --> 00:55:50,102
if I didn't know how
crazy she was about me.

830
00:55:50,171 --> 00:55:53,698
Can't keep her eyes off me.
How come she's always
looking at me?

831
00:55:53,774 --> 00:55:56,038
She wants to see what
a bargain she's getting.

832
00:55:56,110 --> 00:55:58,772
I didn't notice her getting
the welcome mat out for you.

833
00:55:58,846 --> 00:56:02,577
I'm already in the kitchen
with my shoes off.

834
00:56:02,650 --> 00:56:07,087
Ooo, ooo!
Yes, sir, this is great.

835
00:56:07,154 --> 00:56:10,988
I think
my worm has B.O.
It couldn't be you.

836
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:14,653
We'll get another.

837
00:56:17,465 --> 00:56:20,923
I will admit there's something
phony about that dame.

838
00:56:21,002 --> 00:56:23,664
She just don't seem
to belong here in Alaska.

839
00:56:23,738 --> 00:56:27,230
Are you kidding?
That shows how much
you know about women.

840
00:56:27,308 --> 00:56:31,244
Could you see that girl
anywhere but Alaska?

841
00:56:44,258 --> 00:56:47,694
Nah, I guess not.
See what I mean?

842
00:56:47,762 --> 00:56:51,630
You don't know any more
about women than you do
about fishing!

843
00:56:51,699 --> 00:56:54,133
No?
You see what the
score is, don't you?

844
00:56:54,201 --> 00:56:59,639
Duke, 1 3. Chester, 0.
You're skunked, ol' boy.
You're using loaded bait.

845
00:56:59,707 --> 00:57:01,937
When it comes to fishing,
you can't tell how good a guy is...

846
00:57:02,009 --> 00:57:04,705
until you know
what he's fishing for.
Hi, boys.

847
00:57:04,779 --> 00:57:07,304
Here's my filet.
Warm it, honey,
right here.

848
00:57:07,381 --> 00:57:10,544
McGurk, I'd like to be
alone with Sperry.

849
00:57:10,618 --> 00:57:15,180
Run over to Peoria and get me
a ham sandwich and check with
me in about three years.

850
00:57:15,256 --> 00:57:18,225
We may need you
as a bridesmaid.
Wait.

851
00:57:18,292 --> 00:57:20,920
Number 1 4
just checked in.

852
00:57:20,995 --> 00:57:24,658
Well, if you're a good boy,
I'll save you a few heads.

853
00:57:24,732 --> 00:57:26,700
Pick one out
for yourself.

854
00:57:26,767 --> 00:57:29,702
That guy burns me up,
him and his 1 4 fish.

855
00:57:29,770 --> 00:57:31,897
You'd think there
was no romance left.

856
00:57:31,973 --> 00:57:35,670
Think all a fella had to do
was catch one crummy fish!

857
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:38,337
Let's go for a walk
in the woods.
Just a minute.

858
00:57:38,412 --> 00:57:40,471
I got more nibbles
than I can handle.

859
00:57:41,782 --> 00:57:43,579
Hey, bud,
where's your partner?

860
00:57:43,651 --> 00:57:46,950
He just stepped into--
huh?

861
00:57:47,021 --> 00:57:49,421
Just tell him
15 was here.

862
00:57:49,490 --> 00:57:52,050
Come on!

863
00:57:52,126 --> 00:57:54,117
Okay.

864
00:57:54,195 --> 00:57:56,129
Come on!

865
00:58:12,513 --> 00:58:15,812
Come on, folks.
Quit following us, will ya?

866
00:58:23,724 --> 00:58:26,591
It's funny, us going
for each other this way.

867
00:58:26,660 --> 00:58:29,823
I guess
it just had to be.
We couldn't help it.

868
00:58:29,897 --> 00:58:32,127
We were thrown together
by fate.

869
00:58:32,199 --> 00:58:35,259
You weren't thrown together.
That took planning.

870
00:58:35,336 --> 00:58:37,531
Oh, what a project!

871
00:58:37,605 --> 00:58:39,698
Let's sit down.

872
00:58:39,774 --> 00:58:43,266
The minute I heard you sing,
it hit me in the old ticker.

873
00:58:43,344 --> 00:58:47,337
It was going... pitter-patter.
Then... patter-pitter!

874
00:58:47,415 --> 00:58:51,351
How's it going now?
I can't tell
pitter from patter.

875
00:59:00,061 --> 00:59:05,761
#You wouldn't dare
be too bold #

876
00:59:05,833 --> 00:59:08,165
#Would you #

877
00:59:08,235 --> 00:59:14,663
#And think that my hand
was to hold #

878
00:59:14,742 --> 00:59:17,370
#Would you #

879
00:59:17,445 --> 00:59:21,142
#And you
wouldn't play #

880
00:59:21,215 --> 00:59:25,652
# On my sympathy #

881
00:59:25,719 --> 00:59:31,453
#Then take advantage
of me #

882
00:59:32,460 --> 00:59:34,360
#Would you #

883
00:59:36,097 --> 00:59:41,967
#You shouldn't be
quite so near #

884
00:59:42,036 --> 00:59:44,368
# Should you #

885
00:59:44,438 --> 00:59:51,537
# Or whisper those words
in my ear #

886
00:59:51,612 --> 00:59:54,206
# Should you #

887
00:59:54,281 --> 00:59:59,548
#You can't get romantic #

888
00:59:59,620 --> 01:00:05,581
#That you know
takes two #

889
01:00:05,659 --> 01:00:08,628
# But darling #

890
01:00:08,696 --> 01:00:13,360
# If I would #

891
01:00:13,434 --> 01:00:21,500
#Would you ##

892
01:00:23,077 --> 01:00:25,568
Ha-ha!
Hot snow.

893
01:00:26,814 --> 01:00:28,748
Don't get anxious.

894
01:00:28,816 --> 01:00:31,444
Didn't anyone ever
tell you there'd be
moments like this?

895
01:00:31,519 --> 01:00:34,249
My school teacher...
just before we were expelled.

896
01:00:34,321 --> 01:00:37,222
Sperry, how long
must we wait?
Huh?

897
01:00:37,291 --> 01:00:40,920
McGurk's map. Suppose
he runs off with it?
I've got the other half!

898
01:00:40,995 --> 01:00:45,329
I hope it's
in a safe place.
Don't worry.
We're not amateurs.

899
01:00:45,399 --> 01:00:48,334
Where's the map?
There's only one map
I want to talk about.

900
01:00:48,402 --> 01:00:51,701
Yours...
that skin, those lips.
Where is it?

901
01:00:51,772 --> 01:00:55,435
Those eyes, they're beautiful--
and they match!

902
01:00:55,509 --> 01:00:57,477
Are you going
to tell me?

903
01:00:57,545 --> 01:00:59,638
Let's get back
to pitter-patter.

904
01:00:59,713 --> 01:01:02,511
Come on!
Dinner's ready.

905
01:01:03,751 --> 01:01:06,151
Who can eat?
Dinner.

906
01:01:10,891 --> 01:01:12,984
Whoa!
Look at those tracks.

907
01:01:13,060 --> 01:01:16,496
We must be on the
right trail. Come on!

908
01:01:18,699 --> 01:01:21,862
I never thought a woman'd
get me to washing dishes,
drying 'em and liking it.

909
01:01:21,936 --> 01:01:24,268
But I'm washing 'em
and I'm drying 'em...

910
01:01:24,338 --> 01:01:26,533
and I'm liking it!

911
01:01:27,708 --> 01:01:31,041
We'll need some water
for tomorrow's coffee.

912
01:01:31,111 --> 01:01:35,070
Do you mind?
I might as well
get used to it.

913
01:01:45,359 --> 01:01:48,260
I think I'll get
a little fresh air.

914
01:01:52,900 --> 01:01:55,391
Why'd you get rid
of Chowderhead?

915
01:01:55,469 --> 01:01:59,872
The map. He wants
to steal your half
and run away with me.

916
01:01:59,940 --> 01:02:02,602
Who are you kidding?
What map?

917
01:02:02,676 --> 01:02:05,110
He told you where
I had it, huh?

918
01:02:05,179 --> 01:02:07,943
Fine pal.
That's friendship for you.

919
01:02:08,015 --> 01:02:12,645
A man has to sink low when
he'll sell out his best friend.

920
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:16,212
You wouldn't say where
his map is, would you?
You're darn right I wouldn't.

921
01:02:16,290 --> 01:02:20,693
It can stay in his
undershirt until it rots!
It shouldn't take long either.

922
01:02:20,761 --> 01:02:23,355
I trusted him.

923
01:02:23,430 --> 01:02:25,796
When do we leave?
Huh?

924
01:02:25,866 --> 01:02:27,891
Can we get
it tonight?

925
01:02:27,968 --> 01:02:30,937
You've been blowing hot and cold
all through this deal.

926
01:02:31,005 --> 01:02:34,372
How come all of a sudden
I'm your boy?
I'm particular...

927
01:02:34,441 --> 01:02:38,138
what type man I share
a gold mine with.

928
01:02:42,049 --> 01:02:44,711
That the type?
It'll do.

929
01:02:44,785 --> 01:02:46,685
Just some of
my lighter stuff.

930
01:02:46,754 --> 01:02:50,155
Promise me something.
Go back to Frisco and
give yourself up.

931
01:02:50,224 --> 01:02:53,751
What?
We'll fight together.
Maybe they won't hang you.

932
01:02:53,827 --> 01:02:55,886
I got a little T.L. for you.

933
01:02:55,963 --> 01:02:57,988
I'm not McGurk.

934
01:02:58,065 --> 01:03:01,523
It was all an act.
We found the map on the boat.

935
01:03:01,602 --> 01:03:05,129
My name's DukeJohnson.
I knew I couldn't
love a murderer.

936
01:03:05,205 --> 01:03:09,608
That Sperry,
he's the killer.
Oh, a
despicable character!

937
01:03:09,677 --> 01:03:11,645
Those weak eyes,
that shifty chin.

938
01:03:11,712 --> 01:03:14,044
Of course.
Definite criminal type.

939
01:03:14,114 --> 01:03:16,844
We'll take care
of him and his map.

940
01:03:16,917 --> 01:03:18,885
It isn't his map,
it's mine.

941
01:03:18,952 --> 01:03:21,785
It was my father's.
Now it's yours and mine.

942
01:03:21,855 --> 01:03:23,618
The mine, understand?

943
01:03:23,691 --> 01:03:26,387
I think the trip was
a little too much for you.

944
01:03:26,460 --> 01:03:30,556
I'll get the map tomorrow.
There's no time.
They'll kill you.

945
01:03:30,631 --> 01:03:33,065
Larson and those butchers
are up in the hills.

946
01:03:33,133 --> 01:03:35,226
Get some shut-eye.
It'll fix you up.

947
01:03:35,302 --> 01:03:39,466
I think this gal is cracking up.
put her to bed to get rest.

948
01:03:39,540 --> 01:03:42,338
I'll go case
the killer.

949
01:03:42,409 --> 01:03:45,344
But, Duke!

950
01:03:45,412 --> 01:03:47,403
Hey, what's going on?

951
01:03:47,481 --> 01:03:50,450
He's not McGurk and I'm
not going through with it.

952
01:03:50,517 --> 01:03:53,680
I'm in love with him.
You fool! Those thugs
are in the hills.

953
01:03:53,754 --> 01:03:55,984
If you love him, you've
got to go through with it.

954
01:03:56,056 --> 01:03:58,581
He's not McGurk.
They can't kill him.

955
01:03:58,659 --> 01:04:01,423
The only way you can save
him is to get to Ace Larson.

956
01:04:01,495 --> 01:04:05,022
You'll never get out
of here without that map.

957
01:04:05,099 --> 01:04:08,034
Well?
What do you say?

958
01:04:09,436 --> 01:04:12,564
We'll get it tonight
when they're asleep.

959
01:04:20,314 --> 01:04:25,547
#Welcome to my dream #

960
01:04:25,619 --> 01:04:29,020
#And how are you #

961
01:04:30,958 --> 01:04:34,985
#Will you be here long #

962
01:04:35,062 --> 01:04:38,259
# Or just passing through #

963
01:04:39,933 --> 01:04:43,835
# Brush off that stardust #

964
01:04:44,905 --> 01:04:48,306
#Where have you been #

965
01:04:48,375 --> 01:04:53,472
# Don't tell me
your rainbow #

966
01:04:53,547 --> 01:04:57,916
#Was late gettin' in #

967
01:05:01,388 --> 01:05:04,357
#Welcome to my dream #

968
01:05:05,526 --> 01:05:08,324
# It now seems real #

969
01:05:10,097 --> 01:05:12,531
#You're what it needed #

970
01:05:14,134 --> 01:05:17,399
#To make it ideal #

971
01:06:15,529 --> 01:06:18,020
Did you lose something?

972
01:07:10,918 --> 01:07:13,284
Is that you, honey?

973
01:07:13,353 --> 01:07:15,378
Don't say a word.
I'll do the talking.

974
01:07:15,455 --> 01:07:17,946
You're puffing.
You didn't have to run here.

975
01:07:18,025 --> 01:07:21,222
Things are gonna be different
after we're married.

976
01:07:21,295 --> 01:07:23,229
I'm gonna do
big things for you.

977
01:07:23,297 --> 01:07:28,291
I'm gonna buy you real furs.
You won't have to wear this
cheap imitation.

978
01:07:28,368 --> 01:07:31,303
I'm gonna buy you a home.
No more sleeping on cold floors.

979
01:07:31,371 --> 01:07:35,034
- Gesundheit, dear.

980
01:07:35,108 --> 01:07:39,477
And the jewels I'm gonna buy!
Emerald bracelets down to there.

981
01:07:39,546 --> 01:07:41,480
And diamond rings
for your fingers too.

982
01:07:41,548 --> 01:07:44,745
They'll go so well with
those long nails of yours.

983
01:07:49,389 --> 01:07:52,586
Honey, you've been
working too hard!

984
01:07:54,461 --> 01:07:58,864
- Sperry, are you awake?
- Of course, I'm awake.

985
01:07:58,932 --> 01:08:03,301
- Who's that with you?
- Who do you think? It's you.

986
01:08:04,571 --> 01:08:06,198
Grr.

987
01:08:09,576 --> 01:08:11,635
It's... a bear.

988
01:08:11,712 --> 01:08:14,681
Keep calm,
just keep calm.

989
01:08:14,748 --> 01:08:16,807
Help!

990
01:08:16,883 --> 01:08:19,977
Who's your girlfriend,
Junior?
It's a bear.
Do something!

991
01:08:20,053 --> 01:08:22,214
Who do you think I am,
Daniel Boone?

992
01:08:22,289 --> 01:08:25,190
Looks like we've got
another mouth to feed.
Looks like I'm on the menu.

993
01:08:25,258 --> 01:08:28,091
Get my arm
out of here.
She likes
affection maybe.

994
01:08:28,161 --> 01:08:32,120
Keep it up or
we'll both be bear bait.

995
01:08:32,199 --> 01:08:34,690
We'll be so happy together.

996
01:08:34,768 --> 01:08:38,397
I can see us romping
around Yellowstone Park.

997
01:08:38,472 --> 01:08:40,872
- We'll live with your folks.
- Grrr!

998
01:08:40,941 --> 01:08:43,000
All right,
with my folks!

999
01:08:43,076 --> 01:08:45,203
We'll raise a family,
a boy for you, a bear for me.

1000
01:08:45,278 --> 01:08:48,736
Help!
We're cooked.
Here's the house detective.

1001
01:09:12,372 --> 01:09:15,068
A fine thing!
A fish they let talk.

1002
01:09:15,142 --> 01:09:17,440
Me... they won't give
one stinking line!

1003
01:09:24,551 --> 01:09:28,612
Whoa! Whoa!

1004
01:09:28,689 --> 01:09:31,681
I hope
he'll understand.
Quit worrying.

1005
01:09:31,758 --> 01:09:35,250
Come on, Lebec.
Let's go.
Mush!

1006
01:09:53,580 --> 01:09:57,380
Come on! Cut it out.

1007
01:09:57,451 --> 01:10:00,978
Fix our breakfast, Dollface.
We'll see you later.

1008
01:10:01,054 --> 01:10:03,614
Ahh.
Come on, girls.

1009
01:10:05,892 --> 01:10:07,689
Hi, fellas.

1010
01:10:07,761 --> 01:10:09,786
Where's that map?

1011
01:10:09,863 --> 01:10:13,026
The map?
Oh-- Oh, the map!

1012
01:10:13,100 --> 01:10:15,898
Yeah, the map.
Don't worry.
We got it.

1013
01:10:15,969 --> 01:10:19,735
Yeah, we got it.
It's in his cap
and in my--

1014
01:10:22,442 --> 01:10:25,036
Let me see that cap.!

1015
01:10:35,689 --> 01:10:37,748
Okay, this is it.

1016
01:10:37,824 --> 01:10:40,315
Wait. We'll get
the map for you.
Sure.

1017
01:10:40,393 --> 01:10:42,759
Where is it?
Well, it's in--

1018
01:10:42,829 --> 01:10:46,560
It's in the
bear's mouth.
Get it
and be quick.

1019
01:10:55,275 --> 01:10:59,075
Smart guys, us.
We're a couple of pigeons.

1020
01:10:59,146 --> 01:11:01,944
A dame hits us twice
with those big moose eyes...

1021
01:11:02,015 --> 01:11:04,313
and we start
giving away gold mines.

1022
01:11:04,384 --> 01:11:07,285
If we get that map back,
I'm brushing dames off forever.

1023
01:11:07,354 --> 01:11:09,288
They're poison.

1024
01:11:09,356 --> 01:11:13,122
They run their fingers
through your hair, then
throw you in the gutter.

1025
01:11:13,193 --> 01:11:15,388
You know
what's worse?
What?

1026
01:11:15,462 --> 01:11:17,487
I love it.

1027
01:11:17,564 --> 01:11:21,261
Next time,
we shoot first.
And ask questions afterwards.

1028
01:11:21,334 --> 01:11:23,393
Those guys are green.
They won't get far.

1029
01:11:23,470 --> 01:11:26,871
They took our dogs!
Those ain't the only dogs
in Alaska!

1030
01:11:26,940 --> 01:11:28,999
We'll find some.

1031
01:11:32,679 --> 01:11:34,772
A couple of
prospectors.
Yeah.

1032
01:11:34,848 --> 01:11:37,544
Reach!

1033
01:11:45,091 --> 01:11:47,321
Mush!

1034
01:11:52,699 --> 01:11:54,826
They got a good start.
We'll catch 'em.

1035
01:11:54,901 --> 01:11:59,361
Did you ever think
of those dog teams?

1036
01:11:59,439 --> 01:12:03,398
The lead dog is the only dog
that gets a change of scenery.

1037
01:12:03,844 --> 01:12:06,608
Care for
another pillow?

1038
01:12:06,680 --> 01:12:08,648
No, I'm fairly
comfortable.
Yes.

1039
01:12:08,715 --> 01:12:10,945
Mind the bumps
like a good fella, eh?

1040
01:12:12,853 --> 01:12:14,445
Whoa!

1041
01:12:14,521 --> 01:12:16,318
There they are.

1042
01:12:17,891 --> 01:12:21,418
Who's that?
Moose hunting.

1043
01:12:23,697 --> 01:12:28,157
Mush, mush!
Mush. I'm dying
and you want to eat.

1044
01:12:28,235 --> 01:12:30,965
Go ahead.
Come on, boy!

1045
01:12:31,037 --> 01:12:34,632
Boy! Why didn't
I think of this before?

1046
01:12:34,708 --> 01:12:37,108
Exciting, isn't it?

1047
01:12:37,177 --> 01:12:40,169
If Hope and Crosby are caught,
they'll be killed.

1048
01:12:40,247 --> 01:12:42,841
They won't be able to tell
any more of those jokes.

1049
01:12:42,916 --> 01:12:45,646
Come on,
mush, mush!

1050
01:12:50,123 --> 01:12:54,253
Whoa! What is this?
Alcatraz?
Let's hit
for the rocks.

1051
01:12:54,327 --> 01:12:56,625
It's our
only chance.
Hey, they'll find us.

1052
01:12:56,696 --> 01:12:59,722
It's either us
or them.
My money's on them.

1053
01:12:59,799 --> 01:13:01,960
I'll take this rope.
We may need it.

1054
01:13:28,561 --> 01:13:33,191
Nice place to throw
the Grand Canyon.
All this ice
and no ginger ale.

1055
01:13:33,266 --> 01:13:36,258
Stay up.
You'll get a draw.

1056
01:13:37,203 --> 01:13:40,366
You all right?

1057
01:13:40,440 --> 01:13:44,570
We gotta get out somewhere,
either up or down.

1058
01:13:44,644 --> 01:13:47,545
It ain't down.
Let's go down the middle.
Okay.

1059
01:13:47,614 --> 01:13:49,844
Oh-oh, dead end.

1060
01:13:49,916 --> 01:13:53,852
A one-way mountain.
What'll we do now?
We'll use the rope.

1061
01:13:53,920 --> 01:13:57,412
There must be some
reason for it.
It might catch on a tree, huh?

1062
01:13:57,490 --> 01:14:00,220
They gotta be here
somewhere.

1063
01:14:00,293 --> 01:14:02,693
Here goes.
One in a million.
Throw a nail up too.

1064
01:14:06,433 --> 01:14:08,731
Oh, hey!
Help!

1065
01:14:08,802 --> 01:14:12,533
We made it!
Made it?
Boy, one in a million.

1066
01:14:16,710 --> 01:14:18,905
One in a million!
It's solid, let's go.

1067
01:14:18,979 --> 01:14:20,469
Woop!

1068
01:14:21,481 --> 01:14:23,881
Hold on!

1069
01:14:25,885 --> 01:14:28,353
Oh, boy.

1070
01:14:28,421 --> 01:14:31,413
Say, you got
a match?
Yeah. Ohhh!

1071
01:14:31,491 --> 01:14:33,652
What's the matter?
You crazy?

1072
01:14:33,727 --> 01:14:36,423
Match. Rub your head
against the rocks.

1073
01:14:39,866 --> 01:14:43,165
All out.
Top floor.

1074
01:14:43,236 --> 01:14:44,999
Going down.

1075
01:14:45,071 --> 01:14:47,596
I'm slipping.
Untie your boot.

1076
01:14:47,674 --> 01:14:51,166
You touch that boot and
I'll cut your hand off!

1077
01:14:51,244 --> 01:14:53,610
Boy, that'll hold 'em.

1078
01:14:53,680 --> 01:14:55,773
We could've been killed!

1079
01:15:00,420 --> 01:15:04,151
Hey, am I dead?
I can't tell.
You always look that way.

1080
01:15:04,224 --> 01:15:06,089
Come on!

1081
01:15:11,398 --> 01:15:13,263
Shh!

1082
01:15:16,202 --> 01:15:18,762
Shh.
Shh!

1083
01:15:22,509 --> 01:15:25,501
Shh! One little sound
starts a whole avalanche.

1084
01:15:28,348 --> 01:15:31,215
I should have
worn my derby.
You want them to hear us?

1085
01:15:31,284 --> 01:15:33,878
Hiccup the other way.
That's the only way
I know how.

1086
01:15:33,953 --> 01:15:36,148
Suppress it somehow.

1087
01:15:36,222 --> 01:15:38,452
Frighten me.
I can't.
I haven't got a mirror.

1088
01:15:38,525 --> 01:15:40,390
Sing something.
Huh?

1089
01:15:43,963 --> 01:15:46,227
It's cracking up.
One little sound
starts an avalanche.

1090
01:15:46,299 --> 01:15:48,961
Don't worry.
I'm okay now.

1091
01:15:49,035 --> 01:15:52,630
Concentrate. Count to 20.
I can't. I've
got my mittens on.

1092
01:15:52,705 --> 01:15:55,640
Count!
Five, ten, fifteen--

1093
01:15:59,379 --> 01:16:02,212
What now?
I think one more
will do it.

1094
01:16:02,282 --> 01:16:05,740
Let's see you come up
with something now.

1095
01:16:05,819 --> 01:16:09,448
Ready, aim, fire.
I can't.
I'm out of gas.

1096
01:16:09,522 --> 01:16:13,049
Think of something, somebody.
W.C. Fields.
Who?

1097
01:16:20,500 --> 01:16:22,866
Now for Dawson City
and those dames!

1098
01:16:22,936 --> 01:16:26,030
Dames! We'll be lucky
if we get to Dawson City.

1099
01:16:26,106 --> 01:16:29,701
Just a minute.
I'm the navigator.
What? Again?

1100
01:16:41,454 --> 01:16:44,184
They're not Sperry and McGurk.
It's all a mistake.

1101
01:16:44,257 --> 01:16:46,987
Mistakes happen,
but that can be remedied.

1102
01:16:47,060 --> 01:16:50,029
I'll send a couple boys
back to the cabin...

1103
01:16:50,096 --> 01:16:52,087
and they can explain things
to Sperry and McGurk.

1104
01:16:52,165 --> 01:16:56,431
They're not Sperry
and McGurk!
Well, whoever they are.

1105
01:16:56,503 --> 01:16:59,097
You wait here.

1106
01:17:00,440 --> 01:17:03,170
I don't want
any slipup.
How do we spot 'em?

1107
01:17:03,243 --> 01:17:07,577
Wherever they go,
they travel with
a big shaggy dog.

1108
01:17:07,647 --> 01:17:09,842
Drink up.
Keep your eyes open.

1109
01:17:09,916 --> 01:17:12,077
They may be on
their way here now.

1110
01:17:15,488 --> 01:17:17,718
Mush, mush!

1111
01:17:17,790 --> 01:17:21,590
Whoa, you dogs.
Okay, gas up, kids.
Very tiring trip.

1112
01:17:21,661 --> 01:17:24,596
I should've had you at
the other end of the sled.

1113
01:17:24,664 --> 01:17:27,599
Come on, Curly.
Where you going
with that fleabag?

1114
01:17:27,667 --> 01:17:30,101
We got trouble enough.
Stake her out there.
Don't want her?

1115
01:17:30,170 --> 01:17:33,401
Put her over here.
Wait for us, Fuzz.

1116
01:17:33,473 --> 01:17:36,408
If you see anything in slacks,
bark twice and I'll join you.

1117
01:17:36,476 --> 01:17:39,445
Don't forget,
be fair.

1118
01:17:45,885 --> 01:17:47,819
We act tough.

1119
01:17:47,887 --> 01:17:51,118
Mosey over to the bar
and ask a few questions.
Why, ''shore.''

1120
01:18:11,311 --> 01:18:13,677
Couple of strangers
in town.

1121
01:18:13,746 --> 01:18:16,840
Hello, boys.
You new in town?
Yeah.
Yeah.

1122
01:18:16,916 --> 01:18:19,214
Join me
in a drink?
Don't mind
if we do.

1123
01:18:19,285 --> 01:18:22,448
What'll you have?
Oh, a couple fingers
of rotgut.

1124
01:18:22,522 --> 01:18:26,185
What's yours?
I'll take a lemonade...
in a dirty glass!

1125
01:18:26,259 --> 01:18:28,250
What's all
the celebration?

1126
01:18:28,328 --> 01:18:30,455
A posse. There's going
to be a little hanging.

1127
01:18:30,530 --> 01:18:33,590
Little hanging, huh?
Well, what do you know.
Hanging, huh?

1128
01:18:33,666 --> 01:18:36,134
Well, that's
''noose'' to me.

1129
01:18:36,202 --> 01:18:39,069
That's noose--
I made a joke.

1130
01:18:42,075 --> 01:18:44,202
We're killing 'em here.
Or vice versa.

1131
01:18:44,277 --> 01:18:46,745
Hangin', huh?
Sounds gay.

1132
01:18:46,813 --> 01:18:49,008
Sure does.
Happy hunting, partner.

1133
01:18:49,082 --> 01:18:54,884
Who are you stringing up?
Couple of fellas who call
themselves Sperry and McGurk.

1134
01:18:54,954 --> 01:18:57,479
You don't happen
to know them, do you?

1135
01:18:57,557 --> 01:19:01,220
I know Sperry when I see McGurk.
I mean, I know McGurk when--

1136
01:19:01,294 --> 01:19:03,228
Never heard of'em.

1137
01:19:03,296 --> 01:19:05,093
Join us?

1138
01:19:05,164 --> 01:19:08,463
We'd love to,
but it's getting late.
Got a little ironing to do.

1139
01:19:08,534 --> 01:19:10,502
Hey, you!

1140
01:19:10,570 --> 01:19:13,471
It's going to be
a lovely hanging, boys.

1141
01:19:13,539 --> 01:19:16,372
I have an idea
you ought to be there.

1142
01:19:16,442 --> 01:19:19,969
Look, stranger, how you
gonna hang these fellows?

1143
01:19:20,046 --> 01:19:22,310
You don't know 'em.
How 'bout that?

1144
01:19:22,382 --> 01:19:24,543
We'll know 'em
when we see 'em.

1145
01:19:24,617 --> 01:19:28,314
They always travel
with a big shaggy dog.

1146
01:19:28,388 --> 01:19:31,084
Well, I--
I-yi-yi-yi.
I-yi-yi-yi.

1147
01:19:31,157 --> 01:19:33,216
A big shaggy dog,
huh?
Yeah!

1148
01:19:38,965 --> 01:19:42,662
The minute we see that dog,
we're gonna string them up.

1149
01:19:42,735 --> 01:19:46,034
The minute
you see the dog--
Gonna string them up, eh?

1150
01:19:46,105 --> 01:19:50,041
Sounds like a cinch.
All you gotta do
is find a big shaggy dog.

1151
01:19:50,109 --> 01:19:54,239
Alaska's full of them
big shaggy fellas.
A dime a dozen around here.

1152
01:19:58,084 --> 01:20:00,052
All you have to do...

1153
01:20:00,119 --> 01:20:02,644
is find a big
shaggy dog?
What's the
matter with him?

1154
01:20:02,722 --> 01:20:05,885
His foot's gone to sleep.
Stomp on it a bit.

1155
01:20:05,958 --> 01:20:08,426
- Woof!
- Woof!

1156
01:20:08,494 --> 01:20:11,122
Woof!
Woof!
He thinks he's a dog.

1157
01:20:11,197 --> 01:20:13,165
His mother was frightened
by a Pekingese.

1158
01:20:13,232 --> 01:20:15,757
Woof.
Woof, woof.
That's all right, Rover.

1159
01:20:15,835 --> 01:20:18,736
Gimme your paw, Rover.
Gimme your paw.

1160
01:20:18,805 --> 01:20:20,966
That's a good dog.
Okay,
I'm over it.

1161
01:20:21,040 --> 01:20:23,372
You don't think
you're a dog?
I'm not a dog.

1162
01:20:23,443 --> 01:20:26,241
You feel all right?
Feel how cold
my nose is.

1163
01:20:26,312 --> 01:20:29,509
Oh, what a hot horn!
This is a sick dog, sick boy.

1164
01:20:29,582 --> 01:20:31,880
He doesn't look sick.
Let me hear that bark.

1165
01:20:31,951 --> 01:20:33,748
- Woof!
- Woof!

1166
01:20:33,820 --> 01:20:36,118
Quite a big echo.
Come on, Fido.
Woof, woof!

1167
01:20:36,189 --> 01:20:38,180
Oh, he's gone again.

1168
01:20:38,257 --> 01:20:40,418
He's gone.

1169
01:20:42,862 --> 01:20:46,889
Downhill... the
whole place slants.
Whoa, boy.

1170
01:20:49,469 --> 01:20:51,960
Woof!
Woof!

1171
01:20:52,038 --> 01:20:53,437
Woof!

1172
01:20:55,041 --> 01:20:58,272
A little congested.
We'll use
the family entrance.

1173
01:20:58,344 --> 01:21:00,312
Woof, woof, woof!

1174
01:21:04,217 --> 01:21:07,186
It's been fun!

1175
01:21:33,613 --> 01:21:37,014
Let's get 'em!
Come on, boys!

1176
01:21:38,050 --> 01:21:40,245
Hey! Sal.

1177
01:21:40,319 --> 01:21:42,583
Why...
the little crook.

1178
01:21:42,655 --> 01:21:45,590
That's the story, Mr. Lebec.
Kate can tell you.

1179
01:21:45,658 --> 01:21:48,286
The only reason I went through
with it was to save their lives.

1180
01:21:48,361 --> 01:21:50,352
I'm in love
with one of them.

1181
01:21:50,430 --> 01:21:54,025
I'd die before I'd let
anything happen to him.

1182
01:21:54,100 --> 01:21:56,330
Very noble of you.

1183
01:21:56,402 --> 01:21:59,132
Imagine a girl
loving a guy that much.

1184
01:21:59,205 --> 01:22:02,265
Yeah.
I'm not worth it.

1185
01:22:02,341 --> 01:22:06,539
I'm a regular
Casablanca.
Casanova!

1186
01:22:06,612 --> 01:22:08,603
When did they
change that?

1187
01:22:08,681 --> 01:22:13,243
Mr. Larson will understand.
They're here!
Put the map in the safe.

1188
01:22:13,319 --> 01:22:17,380
What about her?
Tie her up. I'll
take care of her later.

1189
01:22:17,457 --> 01:22:21,154
Why the dirty--

1190
01:22:21,227 --> 01:22:24,060
I told you they wouldn't
let you say that.

1191
01:22:31,437 --> 01:22:34,668
We gotta save her!
We'll get that map first.
It's hers!

1192
01:22:34,740 --> 01:22:36,901
Suppose they
knock her off?
They'll be
looking for us.

1193
01:22:36,976 --> 01:22:39,968
We'll get the map and the girl.
What a parley!
Now you're talking.

1194
01:22:41,881 --> 01:22:44,577
Come on, push, push!

1195
01:22:44,650 --> 01:22:47,585
Hey, get out.
Go chase a tree.

1196
01:22:47,653 --> 01:22:49,951
Get rid of him.
Throw something.

1197
01:22:50,022 --> 01:22:53,048
A stick or something.
Get me some brandy.
A stick, yeah.

1198
01:22:53,125 --> 01:22:55,753
Sic! Go!
That way.

1199
01:23:03,269 --> 01:23:05,863
What do you hear?
Shh!

1200
01:23:05,938 --> 01:23:09,135
Who taught you
that racket?
My old man.

1201
01:23:09,208 --> 01:23:11,733
Oh, following in your
father's fingerprints, huh?

1202
01:23:11,811 --> 01:23:15,338
He was great.
Need a little light.

1203
01:23:15,414 --> 01:23:18,474
I'll light
the lantern.
No, you crazy?
They'll see us.

1204
01:23:19,385 --> 01:23:21,876
There's a box
of candles.

1205
01:23:21,954 --> 01:23:24,752
It's a funny-looking candle.

1206
01:23:24,824 --> 01:23:27,384
Why has it got
such a big wick?

1207
01:23:27,460 --> 01:23:30,258
The nights up here
are six months long.
Oh.

1208
01:23:30,329 --> 01:23:33,321
And me with insomnia.

1209
01:23:33,399 --> 01:23:36,391
There's something wrong
with this thing.
Blow on it a little.

1210
01:23:36,469 --> 01:23:38,460
Bring it down here.
Let me see.

1211
01:23:38,538 --> 01:23:42,030
Duke, I'm kinda glad
you talked me into this deal.

1212
01:23:42,108 --> 01:23:44,235
You said it was Utopia
and you were right.

1213
01:23:44,310 --> 01:23:48,679
It's been a lot of work
and I've beefed a lot
but I'll never blow up again.

1214
01:23:48,748 --> 01:23:50,773
Come to Papa.

1215
01:23:50,850 --> 01:23:53,546
There you are, you
pleasant little parchment.
That's great!

1216
01:23:53,619 --> 01:23:56,747
It's only sensational.
Sensational?
It's dynamite!

1217
01:23:59,225 --> 01:24:02,023
It's dynamite!
Take it, it's dynamite.

1218
01:24:02,094 --> 01:24:05,325
Dynamite?
Well, finders keepers!
I couldn't stand the noise.

1219
01:24:05,398 --> 01:24:08,424
Wait for me.
Throw it out the window.
Out the window!

1220
01:24:22,448 --> 01:24:25,383
Back away.
Don't crowd, you dog.
Take five.

1221
01:24:25,451 --> 01:24:28,887
You had to bring that dog!
This is no time to go
shooting off your mouth.

1222
01:24:28,955 --> 01:24:33,654
He's going to do it for us.
Oh, what a fur coat
he's going to make.

1223
01:24:36,262 --> 01:24:38,924
Locked?
Let's spread out
before the joint does.

1224
01:24:40,333 --> 01:24:43,427
They must be here.
Get out and find them.

1225
01:24:43,502 --> 01:24:49,168
Maybe we could sneak through.
That's a slaughter house.
You wanna hang upside down?

1226
01:24:50,142 --> 01:24:52,906
What size hook
do you want?

1227
01:24:55,514 --> 01:24:57,243
Look.!

1228
01:25:02,588 --> 01:25:05,352
Dynamite, see?
The real thing, see?

1229
01:25:05,424 --> 01:25:08,518
I'll give you three to get
out of here. One, two--

1230
01:25:14,767 --> 01:25:19,295
Nice going. Douse it!
Put it out!
Ooo, got a hot knuckle.

1231
01:25:19,372 --> 01:25:23,172
Attaboy.
Thought they could
scare me, huh?

1232
01:25:23,242 --> 01:25:25,938
You got plenty of heart.
It's just close in here.

1233
01:25:26,012 --> 01:25:28,537
What round was it?
Let's find Sal
and get out.

1234
01:25:28,614 --> 01:25:31,310
In here.!
Right rudder.

1235
01:25:31,384 --> 01:25:34,581
Don't worry, baby.
We're here now.

1236
01:25:34,654 --> 01:25:38,112
We showed 'em!
We're not amateurs.
No, sir!

1237
01:25:38,190 --> 01:25:40,624
Get you outta here
in no time.

1238
01:25:40,693 --> 01:25:43,560
We'll get you outta here.
Don't worry.

1239
01:25:43,629 --> 01:25:45,790
I smell
something burning.

1240
01:25:45,865 --> 01:25:47,799
The dynamite!
Put that out!

1241
01:25:47,867 --> 01:25:49,801
Ooo! It's me!
Here!

1242
01:25:53,072 --> 01:25:55,302
Come on.

1243
01:25:55,374 --> 01:25:57,399
It's dynamite going off
in there!

1244
01:25:57,476 --> 01:25:59,944
Where's that map?
Okay, you win.

1245
01:26:00,012 --> 01:26:02,845
Start talking!
It's in there in the desk.
Third drawer from the right.

1246
01:26:02,915 --> 01:26:04,974
Want us to get it?
No more of
your tricks.

1247
01:26:05,051 --> 01:26:08,077
This time, we'll
get it ourselves!

1248
01:26:08,154 --> 01:26:11,988
We'll hear from them later.
They'll be men about town.
Let's go.

1249
01:26:20,966 --> 01:26:23,230
Well, that's it.

1250
01:26:23,302 --> 01:26:27,295
The map, the mine,
the three million dollars.
Not quite.

1251
01:26:27,373 --> 01:26:29,307
Mush!

1252
01:26:29,375 --> 01:26:31,502
Come on!

1253
01:26:50,129 --> 01:26:51,994
Look!
No hands!

1254
01:26:52,064 --> 01:26:55,295
Watch out, no teeth.
Please...
my sponsor.

1255
01:27:16,122 --> 01:27:18,022
This way, come on!
Wait. That's north.

1256
01:27:18,090 --> 01:27:20,820
There isn't any north.
I suppose it went
south for the winter!

1257
01:27:20,893 --> 01:27:23,555
You're near
the North Pole.
What about it?

1258
01:27:23,629 --> 01:27:26,462
There's no north,
south, east or west.
You're crazy!

1259
01:27:26,532 --> 01:27:30,400
East is east and west is west
and never the twain shall meet.

1260
01:27:30,469 --> 01:27:34,098
There's no direction
at the North Pole.
An eight-year-old knows that.

1261
01:27:34,173 --> 01:27:37,836
Next time come here
with an eight-year-old child.
You'll do!

1262
01:27:37,910 --> 01:27:40,276
- Are you getting shorter?
- Me? How 'bout you?

1263
01:27:40,346 --> 01:27:43,247
Oh, I thought it was
getting drafty.

1264
01:27:43,315 --> 01:27:45,408
Aaah!

1265
01:27:51,590 --> 01:27:54,286
Look out.!
They're coming behind you.

1266
01:27:54,360 --> 01:27:56,590
Come on,jump.!

1267
01:27:56,662 --> 01:27:59,187
I can't make it.

1268
01:27:59,265 --> 01:28:02,860
Here's the map.

1269
01:28:02,935 --> 01:28:05,301
I'll hold 'em off
as long as I can.

1270
01:28:05,371 --> 01:28:09,933
Take care of Sal.
She's yours now.
So long, Sal.

1271
01:28:10,009 --> 01:28:11,943
So long, Duke.
Boy, what a pal.

1272
01:28:12,011 --> 01:28:15,412
Anything I can do for you?
Any last requests?

1273
01:28:15,481 --> 01:28:17,381
Look up my mother.

1274
01:28:17,449 --> 01:28:21,476
- Anything else?
- Uh, give her my watch.

1275
01:28:21,554 --> 01:28:23,146
Anything else?

1276
01:28:23,222 --> 01:28:26,487
Tell her to
give you a hot foot.

1277
01:28:37,169 --> 01:28:40,366
What happened, Duke?
How did you get away?
Simple enough.

1278
01:28:40,439 --> 01:28:44,307
There were only 1 5 of them.
I picked them up one by one,

1279
01:28:44,376 --> 01:28:48,210
knocked 'em out and
tossed 'em in the chasm.
Naturally.

1280
01:28:48,280 --> 01:28:50,407
Sal, how
have you been?

1281
01:28:50,482 --> 01:28:53,417
How's he been
treating you?
No complaints, Duke.

1282
01:28:53,485 --> 01:28:58,855
Chester has been a devoted
husband and a fine father.

1283
01:28:58,924 --> 01:29:01,119
Father?
You have children?

1284
01:29:01,193 --> 01:29:04,685
One, a boy.
Would you like to see him?

1285
01:29:04,763 --> 01:29:06,663
Junior?

1286
01:29:10,369 --> 01:29:12,997
Did you call me, Mom?

1287
01:29:17,776 --> 01:29:20,040
We adopted him.

1288
01:29:20,064 --> 01:29:30,064
