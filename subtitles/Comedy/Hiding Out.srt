1
00:01:19,679 --> 00:01:20,509
No, no, no.

2
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,707
You don't like the Bruins
because you don't understand the Bruins.

3
00:01:22,782 --> 00:01:24,147
You wanna watch people skate on ice?

4
00:01:24,217 --> 00:01:26,412
You watch Tai and Randy.
You want hockey?

5
00:01:26,486 --> 00:01:28,477
You wanna see guys
messing each other up with sticks.

6
00:01:28,555 --> 00:01:30,614
That's what people
pay to see, primal shit.

7
00:01:31,791 --> 00:01:33,258
That's not hockey, that's violence.

8
00:01:33,326 --> 00:01:36,261
When the game's played right,
it's about movement, just like dance.

9
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:38,559
What are you, Bambi?
We live in a jungle.

10
00:01:38,631 --> 00:01:39,928
We gotta have outlets for our aggression.

11
00:01:39,999 --> 00:01:42,297
Look, I don't wanna argue with you
this morning, okay?

12
00:01:42,368 --> 00:01:44,461
Hey, Bill, loosen up the sphincter, huh?

13
00:01:44,537 --> 00:01:45,902
You're all bottled up.

14
00:01:45,972 --> 00:01:48,372
- Morning, Andrew.
- How you doing, Joey?

15
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:50,671
Hang in there, Joe.

16
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:04,988
Yeah, we're creative, but I gotta tell you,

17
00:02:05,058 --> 00:02:07,652
word's already out
on the street it's too late.

18
00:02:11,664 --> 00:02:16,397
That one I got 1291<i>/</i>2.

19
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:19,233
Donny. Whoa, whoa, whoa!

20
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:20,738
Hold on!
You think I'm an octopus?

21
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:22,104
I only got two hands here.

22
00:02:22,175 --> 00:02:24,075
Hold on.

23
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:25,839
Lunch would be good.

24
00:02:25,912 --> 00:02:27,402
No, wait, not this week, though.

25
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,311
Marty, you want security?
I'll get you a blanket.

26
00:02:29,382 --> 00:02:31,145
You want big bucks?
You're gonna have to trust me.

27
00:02:31,217 --> 00:02:32,411
Yeah. No, I wouldn't touch it.

28
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:33,952
What they all do and not do?

29
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:37,456
Mary. Yes. Can you get me...

30
00:02:37,524 --> 00:02:38,821
Yeah.

31
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:45,158
Don't trust that guy.
He's a Harvard asshole.

32
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:04,345
Yeah, I gotta get back to this. Okay.

33
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:08,409
Hold on.

34
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:21,693
Yeah. No, no...

35
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:25,004
This is getting very weird.

36
00:03:25,071 --> 00:03:26,299
Jesus Christ!

37
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:27,600
Point that thing the other way!

38
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:29,642
- What has gotten into you?
- It's not safe, Andrew.

39
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:31,199
I just got it off the news wire.

40
00:03:31,277 --> 00:03:33,711
They're delaying the trial another 30 days.

41
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,509
If we have to wait that long, forget it.

42
00:03:35,582 --> 00:03:37,072
- We're dead meat.
- Come on.

43
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,710
What do you think Kapados is gonna do?
Is he gonna kill us? Come on!

44
00:03:39,786 --> 00:03:41,185
He's a businessman.
It's just business.

45
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:44,121
That's what we thought
when we took his bullshit bonds.

46
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:47,250
You don't pass off that much
in counterfeit paper on your own.

47
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:49,420
I'm telling you, we were chumped.

48
00:03:49,495 --> 00:03:51,087
He had us laundering money for the mob.

49
00:03:51,164 --> 00:03:53,689
Bill, Bill...
Okay, go make some money.

50
00:03:53,766 --> 00:03:55,996
You'll feel better, okay?
That's what I'm gonna do.

51
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:59,630
Now, please, hide that thing
before you blow your balls off.

52
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:15,614
If you wanna testify against Kapados, fine.

53
00:04:15,688 --> 00:04:17,155
- Not me.
- What is the big deal?

54
00:04:17,223 --> 00:04:18,622
You stick your hand on a Bible,

55
00:04:18,691 --> 00:04:20,852
you swear to tell the truth,
they find the bastard guilty.

56
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:22,394
And they find us incompetent

57
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:24,726
for having done business with him
in the first place.

58
00:04:24,797 --> 00:04:27,391
Look, my Uncle Fred's
got a dealership in Springfield.

59
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:29,094
I'm gonna be selling used Pintos, man.

60
00:04:29,168 --> 00:04:31,068
Yo, Morenski, back me up here.

61
00:04:31,137 --> 00:04:32,069
Tell him, man.

62
00:04:32,138 --> 00:04:35,733
Bill, Bill, this whole thing's
gonna blow over.

63
00:04:35,808 --> 00:04:38,538
And meanwhile, the three of us
can get back to what's important in life.

64
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:39,873
Forget it.

65
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:41,311
- Andrew. Andrew.
- What?

66
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:42,939
You see this curly one at the bar?

67
00:04:43,016 --> 00:04:45,177
The one in the green?
She's been checking you out.

68
00:04:45,251 --> 00:04:46,445
Do you know her?
What's her name?

69
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:48,180
She trades for First Boston.

70
00:04:48,254 --> 00:04:49,846
Yeah. Janie... something.

71
00:04:49,922 --> 00:04:51,082
Irish.

72
00:04:51,157 --> 00:04:52,784
Listen, I heard Eddie Deckler
on the phone today.

73
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:55,589
He's working a leverage buyout:
American Drainpipe.

74
00:04:55,662 --> 00:04:57,687
- that's more money down the drain.
- Not if you get in today.

75
00:04:57,764 --> 00:04:59,459
This won't be on the street
for five or six weeks.

76
00:04:59,532 --> 00:05:02,262
What's her last name, guys?
Janie McSomething.

77
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:04,200
Closed out today at 45<i>/</i>8.

78
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:06,204
The day this hits,
it's gonna go right through the roof.

79
00:05:06,272 --> 00:05:07,830
If it goes through the roof,
the roof leaks,

80
00:05:07,907 --> 00:05:09,033
you're gonna need a new drainpipe.

81
00:05:09,108 --> 00:05:10,939
Rooney. Janie Rooney.
There you go.

82
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:12,841
Drainpipe. American Drainpipe.

83
00:05:12,912 --> 00:05:14,709
But keep it under your hat, huh?

84
00:05:14,781 --> 00:05:16,976
Let's go, guys.
Tokyo market's just waking up.

85
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:18,142
We gotta fire up the modem.

86
00:05:18,217 --> 00:05:23,211
Listen, Ahern, I think...
I think I'm gonna stay here a little while.

87
00:05:23,289 --> 00:05:26,781
But could you do me a favor and make sure
Quick Draw here gets home in one piece?

88
00:05:26,859 --> 00:05:28,554
Am I the only one here that sees reality?

89
00:05:28,628 --> 00:05:30,755
- We're screwed.
- Andrew sees reality.

90
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,263
It never stopped him from trying.

91
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:33,594
Go for it, Tiger.

92
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:35,930
Come on, Wyatt Earp, we're history.

93
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:52,445
So I'm a little on edge.

94
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:53,678
A little?

95
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:55,618
Look at that.
We're gonna have to swim home.

96
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:58,589
Hey, yo! Taxi! Cab!

97
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:32,101
Hey! Hey! Yo!

98
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:33,873
Hey, you can't park your car over there!

99
00:08:33,946 --> 00:08:35,140
You need a ticket!

100
00:08:35,214 --> 00:08:36,841
Did you hear me?
Don't you see the sign?

101
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:38,349
- You need a ticket!
- Back off!

102
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:43,311
- I said back off.
- Mr. Morenski?

103
00:08:43,389 --> 00:08:44,981
What?

104
00:08:45,057 --> 00:08:46,251
Agent Pratt, FBI.

105
00:08:46,325 --> 00:08:48,725
- This is my associate, Agent Bakey.
- FBI?

106
00:08:48,794 --> 00:08:51,319
Why don't we go back upstairs
and pack you a suitcase.

107
00:08:51,397 --> 00:08:53,524
A suitcase?
What are you talking about?

108
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:55,294
It's for your own protection.

109
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:57,802
Come on.

110
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,167
Ahern.

111
00:08:59,238 --> 00:09:01,297
Ahern, what the hell's going on here?

112
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:03,808
- Morenski!
- What happened?

113
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:07,141
Where's Bill?
Where's Rodriguez, Ahern?

114
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:10,148
Will someone please tell me
what's going on here?

115
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:25,558
What took place at Yasgur's farm?

116
00:09:28,634 --> 00:09:30,226
Guys...

117
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:31,463
I gotta use the phone.

118
00:09:31,537 --> 00:09:33,698
I swear to God,
I won't tell my clients where I am.

119
00:09:33,773 --> 00:09:35,070
But it's been two weeks.

120
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:37,666
The other brokers are gonna
be stealing them away from me.

121
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:40,109
You're stalling again.
Can you believe this?

122
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:42,409
Every question it's the same thing with you!

123
00:09:42,481 --> 00:09:45,678
Give me a break!
I'm tired, okay?

124
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:48,151
Yasgur's farm, Andrew.
What happened?

125
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:50,745
We've covered the same territory
over and over.

126
00:09:50,823 --> 00:09:52,916
We're not getting anyplace like this.

127
00:09:52,992 --> 00:09:54,960
Now let's have it.
What happened?

128
00:09:58,531 --> 00:10:00,658
- A farm, right?
- Right.

129
00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:02,257
Okay...

130
00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:06,237
Does it have anything to do
with Charlie Manson?

131
00:10:06,305 --> 00:10:08,205
The category is Entertainment.

132
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:09,764
Okay, guys, I'm not stalling now.

133
00:10:09,842 --> 00:10:11,139
I'm quitting. That's it.

134
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:13,440
Got a bad case of the trivia DTs.

135
00:10:13,512 --> 00:10:14,501
Yasgur's farm.

136
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,741
Andrew, it's where they held Woodstock.

137
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:19,444
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I knew that.

138
00:10:19,518 --> 00:10:21,543
Where do you think you're going?

139
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:24,590
I'm going out to mail
a birthday card to my grandma.

140
00:10:24,657 --> 00:10:26,682
Is that okay with you?

141
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:28,420
Any of you guys got a stamp?

142
00:10:28,494 --> 00:10:30,792
Sorry, pal. No way.
We can't let you out.

143
00:10:30,863 --> 00:10:32,888
I don't believe this!
Kapados is the criminal!

144
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:34,193
He's out on bail!

145
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:36,097
I'm stuck here like
some kind of axe murderer!

146
00:10:36,168 --> 00:10:37,430
Where do you guys have Ahern?

147
00:10:37,503 --> 00:10:39,130
Does he have the same kind
of deluxe accommodations?

148
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:41,070
You want luxury or you wanna be kept alive?

149
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,836
Give me a day to think about that.

150
00:10:43,909 --> 00:10:47,140
Listen, it's nothing personal, guys,
but I gotta get some fresh air.

151
00:10:47,213 --> 00:10:50,080
No, you're not going out,
and you're not making any calls.

152
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:51,309
Come on!

153
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:52,749
Hell, I could use some real food.

154
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:55,013
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

155
00:10:55,087 --> 00:10:56,452
No.

156
00:10:56,522 --> 00:10:58,046
Morrill specifically said...

157
00:10:58,124 --> 00:11:01,059
Morrill's nads have been
tied to a desk for 20 years.

158
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:02,458
I know the street.

159
00:11:02,528 --> 00:11:04,928
This hour of the day, buried this deep,

160
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:06,931
I'm with Richie Rich.

161
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:08,523
Let's go.

162
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:19,840
Hey, hey, hold up, hold up.

163
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:23,742
No calls, all right?

164
00:11:23,816 --> 00:11:25,647
That's something that we can't
be flexible about.

165
00:11:25,718 --> 00:11:26,980
This book is just my clients.

166
00:11:27,053 --> 00:11:28,042
You know, it's my people.

167
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,951
If I don't have it with me,
I get tense, okay?

168
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:31,819
Ain't that cute?
It's like his little teddy bear.

169
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:33,916
You guys have no idea how hard it is

170
00:11:33,993 --> 00:11:35,984
for a broker to line up quality clientele.

171
00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:37,962
- Quality clientele?
- Quality clientele?

172
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,055
Like Kapados?

173
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:48,663
Morenski, just go for the pancakes.

174
00:11:48,741 --> 00:11:51,403
Go for something.
We don't got all day.

175
00:11:51,477 --> 00:11:52,466
The waffles.

176
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:54,172
It says here that they're golden brown.

177
00:11:54,246 --> 00:11:56,476
Is that really true?

178
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:00,310
Okay, I'll have the number 5
waffle breakfast

179
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:02,320
with the bacon extra well done.

180
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,049
How about a nice glass of milk?

181
00:12:04,123 --> 00:12:05,818
That they can make golden brown.

182
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:07,756
No, actually.
I'd like a Scotch, please.

183
00:12:07,827 --> 00:12:09,988
Do her straight up. Thank you.

184
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:12,530
Baby doll, it's 6 in the morning.

185
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:15,360
Then make it a double, please.

186
00:12:15,434 --> 00:12:16,924
Let's see some I.D.

187
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:19,496
I don't believe this.

188
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:22,097
Let me show you mine, huh?

189
00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:24,941
Figures.

190
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:27,444
You don't identify yourself,

191
00:12:27,513 --> 00:12:30,311
not to anybody, not anywhere, period.

192
00:12:30,382 --> 00:12:32,577
I don't know if you're aware of this,
but once you testify,

193
00:12:32,651 --> 00:12:34,516
they're probably gonna get you relocated.

194
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:37,420
It's Uncle Sam's way of keeping you alive
after you've spilled the beans.

195
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:39,048
You get a new name,
you get a new town,

196
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:40,251
you get a new everything.

197
00:12:40,326 --> 00:12:43,921
Yeah, a lot of guys end up
living in national parks.

198
00:12:43,996 --> 00:12:46,260
They become forest rangers.

199
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:48,300
Trust me, you'll love it.

200
00:12:48,367 --> 00:12:50,096
Bakey, I already got a name, okay?

201
00:12:50,169 --> 00:12:52,694
I got a job and a Maserati.

202
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:54,296
I got a two-bedroom co-op in Cambridge.

203
00:12:54,373 --> 00:12:55,897
Come on, I'm located.

204
00:12:55,975 --> 00:12:58,273
That's it. End of discussion.

205
00:12:58,344 --> 00:13:00,437
Hey, they're really into plastic surgery.

206
00:13:02,248 --> 00:13:03,681
I'm getting hip to you, Bakey.

207
00:13:03,749 --> 00:13:06,274
I can tell when you're bullshitting.

208
00:13:06,352 --> 00:13:08,786
Yeah, right.
I'm gonna let the FBI relocate my nose.

209
00:13:08,854 --> 00:13:11,846
- You guys are nuts.
- I gotta take a wicked dump.

210
00:13:14,326 --> 00:13:16,988
Classy individual.

211
00:13:17,062 --> 00:13:18,552
Classy joint.

212
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,895
I almost forgot.
I found you a stamp.

213
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:23,093
Oh, thanks.

214
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:26,263
The way I figure it, at least
you don't have a wife and kids.

215
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:29,967
That's when it gets really tough.

216
00:13:30,042 --> 00:13:31,031
No.

217
00:13:32,211 --> 00:13:33,940
No calls.

218
00:13:36,182 --> 00:13:38,810
If I wasn't on duty, I'd join you in a round.

219
00:13:39,185 --> 00:13:40,777
Pratt!

220
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:43,286
Pratt!

221
00:13:45,624 --> 00:13:47,114
Son of a bitch!

222
00:14:09,748 --> 00:14:11,739
Down the alley. Block him off.

223
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:22,093
Get out of the way!

224
00:15:17,483 --> 00:15:19,144
Hey!

225
00:16:11,003 --> 00:16:12,732
Dark hair, kinda tall.

226
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:14,466
Oh, yeah, and he had this hairdo...

227
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:17,338
Some kind of Dracula hairdo.

228
00:16:17,409 --> 00:16:19,741
We put or best manpower
into finding Morenski.

229
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,905
Was your best anything like Bakey?

230
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,505
Pathetic. He's an embarrassment.

231
00:16:23,582 --> 00:16:25,049
He's a solid agent, for Christ's sake.

232
00:16:25,117 --> 00:16:26,709
25 years experience with the Bureau.

233
00:16:26,785 --> 00:16:28,912
Doesn't show.
Now I'm short two witnesses.

234
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,615
Well, at least Morenski got out alive.

235
00:16:30,689 --> 00:16:32,418
You hope.

236
00:16:33,692 --> 00:16:35,353
Morrill, please don't let them
take me off the case.

237
00:16:35,427 --> 00:16:37,156
I'm to blame.
I know I'm responsible...

238
00:16:37,229 --> 00:16:39,789
Bakey, for Christ's sake,
I bought you some time.

239
00:16:39,865 --> 00:16:41,355
But you can't blame that guy.

240
00:16:41,433 --> 00:16:43,765
His whole case is going down the drain.
Kapados will walk.

241
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:46,031
That son of a bitch of a bastard
killed my partner.

242
00:16:46,105 --> 00:16:48,073
You just find me Morenski.

243
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,539
If he's hiding, smoke him out.

244
00:16:49,608 --> 00:16:51,075
If he's dead, bring him back to life.

245
00:16:51,143 --> 00:16:52,371
But find the man.

246
00:16:52,444 --> 00:16:54,969
- I will do everything...
- I don't wanna hear nothing.

247
00:17:10,629 --> 00:17:13,097
- Thanks a million.
- Anytime.

248
00:17:22,341 --> 00:17:24,536
And is there some reason
that you left the trash can...

249
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:29,680
- I'll get it.
- Make it fast.

250
00:17:29,748 --> 00:17:31,215
Can I help you?

251
00:17:31,283 --> 00:17:32,614
- Who's this?
- Who's this?

252
00:17:32,684 --> 00:17:35,278
Your cousin Andrew.

253
00:17:35,354 --> 00:17:36,548
Patrick, is that you?

254
00:17:36,622 --> 00:17:38,249
Yo, Cuz!

255
00:17:38,323 --> 00:17:40,518
Hey, kid! What a relief!
I thought I had the wrong number.

256
00:17:40,592 --> 00:17:42,082
- Patrick...
- How you doing?

257
00:17:42,161 --> 00:17:44,425
- Well, I'm alive.
- Yeah?

258
00:17:44,496 --> 00:17:47,260
I heard you were in some kind of jam,
something with the FBI.

259
00:17:47,332 --> 00:17:49,163
Patrick, Aunt Lucy, is she around?

260
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:51,225
Oh, yeah.
Hey, guess what.

261
00:17:51,303 --> 00:17:52,531
I really don't have the time.

262
00:17:52,604 --> 00:17:54,435
I'm days away from my learner's permit.

263
00:17:54,506 --> 00:17:56,701
As a matter of fact,
we were just going out to practice.

264
00:17:56,775 --> 00:17:58,868
Wow, that... that's terrific.

265
00:17:58,944 --> 00:18:00,571
Can I speak to your mom, please?

266
00:18:00,646 --> 00:18:02,409
Hey, where are you calling from?

267
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:05,143
Well, beats the shit out of me.

268
00:18:05,217 --> 00:18:07,208
It sounds like you're calling
from the Maserati, huh?

269
00:18:07,286 --> 00:18:10,119
Can you please put your mom
on the phone, Patrick?

270
00:18:10,189 --> 00:18:11,816
Maybe you'll let me drive it sometime.

271
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:13,118
I've been practicing day and night.

272
00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:14,716
Left turns suck, but other than that...

273
00:18:14,793 --> 00:18:17,125
Patrick, put your mother
on the frickin' phone!

274
00:18:17,196 --> 00:18:19,187
- Are we a little tense?
- Yes!

275
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,858
Nurse, it's the stool pigeon.

276
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,459
Hey, I'll go pull the car out.

277
00:18:24,536 --> 00:18:27,664
Andrew, that picture of you
in the paper was awful.

278
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:49,821
Oh, my God.

279
00:19:00,672 --> 00:19:03,072
Patrick, my God.

280
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,542
I'll clean it up later, Mom.

281
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:11,275
Your cousin Andrew...

282
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:14,183
Your cousin Andrew's coming
to stay with us for a little while.

283
00:19:14,253 --> 00:19:15,379
- Really?
- Yeah.

284
00:19:15,454 --> 00:19:17,217
He's meeting me tomorrow
in the school office.

285
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:18,916
Now that's just between you and me.

286
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:20,856
Not a peep word.

287
00:19:20,926 --> 00:19:23,087
Okay. Be careful.

288
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:29,529
- Patrick!
- Sorry.

289
00:19:39,144 --> 00:19:42,204
Nosebleed.

290
00:19:42,281 --> 00:19:44,442
Major nosebleed.

291
00:20:15,113 --> 00:20:17,377
Holy shit.

292
00:20:27,192 --> 00:20:30,286
The mellow spot on the dial, WMLO.

293
00:20:30,362 --> 00:20:35,959
The metal never gets heavy,
and the rock never gets hard.

294
00:20:54,886 --> 00:20:56,376
Yo, mister! Mister!

295
00:20:56,455 --> 00:20:58,650
May I have a cigarette, please?

296
00:20:58,724 --> 00:21:00,692
Yeah, sure.

297
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:02,158
Wait.

298
00:21:02,227 --> 00:21:04,695
That's a real nice coat you got there.

299
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:06,128
You wouldn't...

300
00:21:06,198 --> 00:21:08,063
You wouldn't want to trade it
for this one, would you?

301
00:21:08,133 --> 00:21:10,693
No, I don't want that coat.
I just want a cigarette.

302
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:13,431
Are you crazy?
This is $500 Italian-made coat.

303
00:21:13,505 --> 00:21:14,938
I bought this in Milan.

304
00:21:15,007 --> 00:21:18,534
You paid five Cs for that,
and you're asking me if I'm crazy?

305
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:20,339
- Okay, I'll give you the coat...
- No.

306
00:21:20,412 --> 00:21:22,209
the shirt and a pack of cigarettes.

307
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:25,148
No... It's a deal.

308
00:21:37,763 --> 00:21:39,993
Wait, wait.

309
00:21:40,065 --> 00:21:42,033
For my grandmother.

310
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,658
Thanks a lot. Enjoy it.

311
00:21:43,735 --> 00:21:45,464
Have a pleasant day.

312
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,698
Hey, hey!

313
00:21:49,775 --> 00:21:51,072
Hey, guys, look what I got!

314
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:52,405
Cigarettes!

315
00:22:17,135 --> 00:22:18,159
Excuse me.

316
00:22:18,236 --> 00:22:21,728
Can I possibly get a cigarette from you?

317
00:22:22,941 --> 00:22:24,431
Thank you.

318
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:26,841
Got a light?

319
00:22:26,912 --> 00:22:29,210
Come on. Anyone got a light?

320
00:22:37,756 --> 00:22:39,383
A reminder from Mrs. Billings,

321
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:44,293
there is absolutely no smoking
on the school grounds.

322
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:49,824
This includes all faculty,
fellow students...

323
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:54,430
Take a seat.
It'll be a minute.

324
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:57,842
Dude! Humbuckers!

325
00:22:57,909 --> 00:23:01,174
Five-position rotary switch, 24 frets,

326
00:23:01,246 --> 00:23:03,009
nickel-plated bridge, and it's black!

327
00:23:03,081 --> 00:23:05,208
Man, that's pretty serious.

328
00:23:05,283 --> 00:23:07,046
You three, sit up!

329
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:10,912
Come on inside.

330
00:23:10,989 --> 00:23:13,787
It's okay.
I didn't call your parents, yet.

331
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:16,521
No, I think you're making a real mistake.

332
00:23:16,595 --> 00:23:19,621
And taking a blowtorch to the couch
in the teachers' lounge?

333
00:23:19,698 --> 00:23:21,962
Was that also, perhaps, a real mistake?

334
00:23:22,033 --> 00:23:23,898
- But l...
- Hey, man, you did it...

335
00:23:23,969 --> 00:23:25,402
and now you're, what, sorry?

336
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:27,370
Maybe depressed a little?

337
00:23:27,439 --> 00:23:29,430
Hey, I am not the enemy.

338
00:23:29,508 --> 00:23:32,033
Why don't you just come on in... Sean?

339
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:34,044
Go ahead and call up my parents, dude.

340
00:23:34,112 --> 00:23:35,739
I didn't do shit.

341
00:23:36,982 --> 00:23:38,142
Come on in, Sean.

342
00:23:38,216 --> 00:23:39,444
Go ahead and call them, man!

343
00:23:39,518 --> 00:23:41,383
I didn't so shit!

344
00:23:41,453 --> 00:23:45,082
Attention students.
All students.

345
00:23:45,157 --> 00:23:48,684
The second bell is not a warning bell.

346
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,125
It is a late bell.

347
00:23:50,195 --> 00:23:53,289
Young man, are you supposed
to be in this office?

348
00:23:53,365 --> 00:23:54,627
Let me see your pass.

349
00:23:54,699 --> 00:23:57,224
I don't...

350
00:23:57,302 --> 00:23:59,600
I don't have one.

351
00:23:59,671 --> 00:24:01,036
I'm new here.

352
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:03,301
Have you been to the registrar's office?

353
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:05,673
- No.
- Well, here.

354
00:24:05,744 --> 00:24:06,938
Here's a pass.

355
00:24:07,012 --> 00:24:08,502
Go down to the end of the hall,

356
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:11,105
take a left,
then up the stairs and turn left.

357
00:24:11,183 --> 00:24:12,548
Thank you.

358
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:15,848
Warning: get to class.

359
00:24:15,921 --> 00:24:19,914
The second one says you're late.

360
00:24:19,991 --> 00:24:22,186
If you don't hear the second bell,

361
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:24,785
see the nurse right away
about having the wax

362
00:24:24,863 --> 00:24:26,160
taken out of your ears.

363
00:24:26,231 --> 00:24:28,699
Edna, my nephew,
he's supposed to meet me here.

364
00:24:28,767 --> 00:24:29,825
I'm running a little late.

365
00:24:29,901 --> 00:24:32,301
First name first, last name last.

366
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:34,065
Andrew...

367
00:24:37,242 --> 00:24:39,437
- Are you all right?
- Oh, yeah.

368
00:24:39,511 --> 00:24:42,412
My name?
You want my name?

369
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:44,808
Maxwell.

370
00:24:44,883 --> 00:24:47,408
Maxwell what?

371
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:49,818
Haus... er.

372
00:24:49,888 --> 00:24:51,753
Hauser.

373
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:54,189
H-A-U-S-E-R.

374
00:24:54,259 --> 00:24:56,625
- Last school attended?
- Cornell.

375
00:24:56,695 --> 00:25:00,153
High School! In Texas.

376
00:25:00,232 --> 00:25:03,065
A small... small town in Texas.

377
00:25:03,134 --> 00:25:05,329
My records could take weeks.

378
00:25:05,403 --> 00:25:07,394
Everything takes weeks.

379
00:25:07,472 --> 00:25:08,530
All right.

380
00:25:08,607 --> 00:25:14,170
Here is the spectrum of human sexuality.

381
00:25:19,784 --> 00:25:22,309
- Oh, hi.
- Hello.

382
00:25:23,922 --> 00:25:26,186
Maxwell... Am I pronouncing this
correctly? Hauser?

383
00:25:26,258 --> 00:25:27,850
- Yeah.
- All right.

384
00:25:27,926 --> 00:25:28,893
There's a seat for you.

385
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,326
You just make yourself at school.

386
00:25:31,396 --> 00:25:33,762
And who would like to tell Maxwell
what we've been talking about? Mike?

387
00:25:33,832 --> 00:25:35,663
Alternative lifestyles.

388
00:25:35,734 --> 00:25:37,793
And specifically the area of...

389
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:39,063
Homosexuality.

390
00:25:39,137 --> 00:25:40,729
No!

391
00:25:40,805 --> 00:25:43,330
No, sexual preference.

392
00:25:43,408 --> 00:25:46,536
Maybe this is an area
you touched on previously, Max?

393
00:25:46,611 --> 00:25:50,206
Well, I've touched on it,
but a refresher never hurt.

394
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:56,950
All right. At one end,
we have heterosexuality.

395
00:25:58,323 --> 00:26:03,920
And at the other end, homosexuality.

396
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:11,026
I know this is not a subject that we feel
free to discuss easily and openly, but...

397
00:26:11,102 --> 00:26:12,069
Patrick.

398
00:26:12,137 --> 00:26:13,434
- I have to remind you...
- Patrick.

399
00:26:13,505 --> 00:26:15,769
that if we don't share,
if we don't communicate,

400
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:19,571
then we can't begin
to understand who we are.

401
00:26:19,644 --> 00:26:21,544
At one time or another,

402
00:26:21,613 --> 00:26:23,843
whether you choose
to acknowledge it or not,

403
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:25,712
every one of us...

404
00:26:25,784 --> 00:26:28,480
every one of us...

405
00:26:28,553 --> 00:26:31,317
has experienced feelings
at all points along this spectrum,

406
00:26:31,389 --> 00:26:34,051
including homosexuality.

407
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:35,524
Patrick.

408
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:38,961
I don't expect anyone to stand up
in this room and proclaim their gayness,

409
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:40,964
- but on the...
- Patrick.

410
00:26:41,032 --> 00:26:42,761
Max.

411
00:26:42,834 --> 00:26:47,066
That is really courageous of you.

412
00:26:53,645 --> 00:26:54,873
Kevin.

413
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:57,244
Oh, no...

414
00:26:57,315 --> 00:26:58,247
Move it, please.

415
00:26:58,316 --> 00:26:59,544
Wait up!

416
00:27:02,053 --> 00:27:04,112
Attention, sophomores.

417
00:27:04,189 --> 00:27:07,022
Drama Club tryouts
will take place next Friday

418
00:27:07,092 --> 00:27:08,889
in the band practice room.

419
00:27:14,933 --> 00:27:17,197
Rape! Rape!

420
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:21,196
Get back!

421
00:27:21,272 --> 00:27:24,002
Don't make me have to hurt you.

422
00:27:24,075 --> 00:27:27,511
Look, bub, here's the spectrum, okay?

423
00:27:27,579 --> 00:27:29,342
On this side, we got homo.

424
00:27:29,414 --> 00:27:31,006
And over here, here's hetero.

425
00:27:31,082 --> 00:27:34,142
And here's me, way the fuck over here.

426
00:27:34,219 --> 00:27:35,846
Now, what other people do,

427
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,615
different lifestyles, stuff like that,

428
00:27:37,689 --> 00:27:39,088
that's all fine and dandy with me...

429
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:41,921
But, Patrick, I love you.

430
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:44,154
- Oh, God.
- Like a cousin.

431
00:27:44,229 --> 00:27:45,821
Cousin.

432
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:51,294
Andrew! Oh, Andrew!
Thank God!

433
00:27:51,369 --> 00:27:53,462
Max.

434
00:27:53,538 --> 00:27:54,732
Max?

435
00:27:54,806 --> 00:27:56,774
Oh, jeez.

436
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:58,206
What happened to your head?

437
00:27:58,276 --> 00:28:00,107
Long story.

438
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:03,174
Jesus Christ.

439
00:28:03,248 --> 00:28:06,240
This is not how I remember
high school girls looking.

440
00:28:06,317 --> 00:28:10,151
Half these girls look like they're 35
and just got divorced.

441
00:28:10,221 --> 00:28:11,882
Hey, yo, Clinton, my man!
How you doing?

442
00:28:11,956 --> 00:28:13,548
What's up, man?

443
00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:15,559
That guy's a friend of mine.

444
00:28:15,627 --> 00:28:17,788
What the hell are you...
Don't breathe!

445
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:21,563
Nice day.

446
00:28:21,633 --> 00:28:24,932
Cocksucking fascist Ayatollah.

447
00:28:25,003 --> 00:28:28,131
Mr. Morenski, may I ask
what's under your foot?

448
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:31,198
Linoleum?

449
00:28:31,276 --> 00:28:32,766
I'm sorry.

450
00:28:32,844 --> 00:28:35,438
I was smoking and...

451
00:28:35,513 --> 00:28:37,276
It's my first day.

452
00:28:37,348 --> 00:28:39,816
No smoking on the school grounds!

453
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:41,112
Understand?

454
00:28:41,186 --> 00:28:42,949
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

455
00:28:43,021 --> 00:28:44,579
Sorry.

456
00:28:44,656 --> 00:28:46,521
"Sorry" doesn't cut it here.

457
00:28:46,591 --> 00:28:48,183
Understood?

458
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:58,331
All right, Max, let's get something straight.

459
00:28:58,403 --> 00:28:59,665
You left the outside world.

460
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:01,205
We got to orient your thinking.

461
00:29:01,272 --> 00:29:03,365
You gotta think repression, think limits,

462
00:29:03,441 --> 00:29:05,534
think humiliation and despair.

463
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:08,170
You're in high school, for Christ's sakes.

464
00:29:10,682 --> 00:29:11,614
Patrick?

465
00:29:11,683 --> 00:29:13,844
- Patrick, wait up.
- Patrick.

466
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:15,510
The acid test...
you'll never get away with it.

467
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:16,986
- You wanna make a bet?
- How much?

468
00:29:17,055 --> 00:29:18,249
If she doesn't recognize me,

469
00:29:18,323 --> 00:29:19,813
you do my homework
the whole time I'm here.

470
00:29:19,891 --> 00:29:20,949
If she does?

471
00:29:21,025 --> 00:29:22,720
You still do my homework,
only I pay a hundred bucks.

472
00:29:22,794 --> 00:29:24,819
No, I'll do your homework.
$100 if I lose, two if I win.

473
00:29:24,896 --> 00:29:26,557
- Oh, come on!
- I'm trying to save up for a car.

474
00:29:26,631 --> 00:29:27,495
- Okay.
- Easy money.

475
00:29:27,565 --> 00:29:28,691
- Patrick.
- Hi, Mom.

476
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:31,133
- Mom, I want you to meet Max.
- He just started here today.

477
00:29:31,202 --> 00:29:33,033
Honey, I wanna get home
and check the machine.

478
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:34,298
I'm concerned about your cousin.

479
00:29:34,372 --> 00:29:36,533
- He never showed up.
- No? You're kidding.

480
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:38,599
- Are you sure?
- Patrick, come here.

481
00:29:38,676 --> 00:29:40,166
He was in all the papers today.

482
00:29:40,245 --> 00:29:41,974
Somebody's trying to kill him.

483
00:29:42,046 --> 00:29:43,809
I just hope Grandma's not freaking out.

484
00:29:43,882 --> 00:29:45,816
You know how she is about Andrew.

485
00:29:45,884 --> 00:29:47,215
So, Mom... Mom!

486
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:49,378
You definitely didn't see him today?

487
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:51,820
Patrick, now didn't I just say that?

488
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:53,653
I'm going now.
You wanna practice driving?

489
00:29:53,725 --> 00:29:55,317
You can take me home.

490
00:29:55,393 --> 00:29:57,861
No. I think me and Max here,
we'll just hang out a while.

491
00:29:57,929 --> 00:29:59,396
Max, say good-bye to my mom.

492
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:02,262
- Mom, this is Max.
- Nice meeting you, Max.

493
00:30:02,333 --> 00:30:03,960
Honey, your dinner's in the freezer.

494
00:30:04,035 --> 00:30:05,297
I have class tonight.

495
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:08,567
Mom!

496
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:12,602
So what is this?
Someone's trying to kill you?

497
00:30:12,677 --> 00:30:14,770
- I need a stiff drink.
- Yeah, so do I.

498
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:18,678
Son of a bitch.
It even made the papers here.

499
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:21,776
Watch it, Patrick.
Don't bust my stool.

500
00:30:21,853 --> 00:30:24,413
Okay, we got two
wild cherry slush buckets.

501
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:29,153
Mega for you, and colossal
for Goldilocks over here.

502
00:30:29,227 --> 00:30:31,388
Did you ever ask yourself,
"How did I get here?"

503
00:30:31,462 --> 00:30:32,656
I used to.

504
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:35,290
Now I just asked myself,
"How the hell do I get out?"

505
00:30:37,135 --> 00:30:39,695
So, who wants to kill you?

506
00:30:39,771 --> 00:30:41,864
This money guy, Victor Kapados.

507
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:44,909
He came to our company with a lot
of bonds he wanted us to handle.

508
00:30:44,976 --> 00:30:47,171
Millions of dollars worth.

509
00:30:47,245 --> 00:30:50,578
The whole was set up
to look legit, but it wasn't.

510
00:30:50,648 --> 00:30:53,014
What's up, dork?

511
00:30:53,084 --> 00:30:54,915
So? That's not your fault?

512
00:30:54,986 --> 00:30:56,044
Yeah, but I'm a witness.

513
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:58,020
And the Justice Department
wants me to testify

514
00:30:58,089 --> 00:30:59,920
that I accepted the paper.

515
00:30:59,991 --> 00:31:01,925
So that's you, huh?

516
00:31:01,993 --> 00:31:04,154
Me, Ahern, and Rodriguez.

517
00:31:04,229 --> 00:31:06,493
Now, Rodriguez has an excuse.

518
00:31:06,564 --> 00:31:08,464
He's dead.

519
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:10,592
But, Ahern they still have in custody,

520
00:31:10,668 --> 00:31:13,068
so he can testify.

521
00:31:13,137 --> 00:31:15,435
What they did to Pratt, though.

522
00:31:17,075 --> 00:31:19,236
I've never seen anything like it.

523
00:31:21,579 --> 00:31:24,673
Is that gonna be cash or cash, huh?

524
00:31:26,017 --> 00:31:28,315
Let me consult
with my accountant here.

525
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:32,117
Yo, Max, old pal,
can I borrow your wallet?

526
00:31:34,659 --> 00:31:36,024
Hey, and, Gertie, while you're at it,

527
00:31:36,094 --> 00:31:37,755
could you throw in a bag of potato chips,

528
00:31:37,829 --> 00:31:39,763
a tube of Bazooka, and a Snickers bar?

529
00:31:39,831 --> 00:31:42,026
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Thanks.

530
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:44,000
Let's get out of here.

531
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:47,162
Where do they put the comic
in a tube of Bazooka?

532
00:32:01,286 --> 00:32:02,776
- Hey, Gertie.
- Yeah?

533
00:32:02,854 --> 00:32:04,185
Patrick left this behind.

534
00:32:05,356 --> 00:32:06,584
Yeah, yeah, we'll mail it, yeah.

535
00:32:08,526 --> 00:32:09,686
Hey, Patrick!

536
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:11,524
This one isn't too bad.
Can I wear it tomorrow?

537
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:13,359
- Sure.
- Thanks.

538
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:16,332
Patrick!

539
00:32:16,401 --> 00:32:17,527
Just a second!

540
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:18,762
You said she wasn't here.

541
00:32:18,836 --> 00:32:20,929
I made a mistake. Stay calm.

542
00:32:21,005 --> 00:32:23,439
Quick! Hide in here.
Down in here.

543
00:32:23,508 --> 00:32:25,032
Patrick!

544
00:32:26,544 --> 00:32:28,603
Mom! Mom, this is my room, my sanctum.

545
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:31,171
I knocked, but who could hear?

546
00:32:31,249 --> 00:32:32,682
I thought you left.

547
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:34,342
I did.

548
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:39,681
But then it occurred to me,
I really should call the FBI.

549
00:32:39,757 --> 00:32:41,850
Mom, you called the FBI?

550
00:32:41,926 --> 00:32:42,893
Oh, my God!

551
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:44,952
Why are you so upset about that?

552
00:32:45,029 --> 00:32:46,553
Upset? Do I look upset?

553
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:47,962
Me? Upset? No.

554
00:32:48,032 --> 00:32:51,160
I've been trying for the last half hour
to get through, then, finally, I did.

555
00:32:51,235 --> 00:32:52,964
I got a recording.

556
00:32:53,037 --> 00:32:55,505
Mom, I say we don't
tell the feds anything, huh?

557
00:32:55,573 --> 00:32:57,302
I mean, maybe the cuz just...

558
00:32:57,375 --> 00:32:59,866
maybe he just needs
a little breathing room.

559
00:32:59,944 --> 00:33:00,968
- Patrick.
- What?

560
00:33:01,045 --> 00:33:02,603
What are these?

561
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:05,012
Garments?

562
00:33:05,083 --> 00:33:06,846
Mom! I wouldn't
touch those if I were you.

563
00:33:06,918 --> 00:33:08,510
Please. Please.
I'll wash them, I promise.

564
00:33:08,586 --> 00:33:11,020
I thought we had a deal.
Think about it.

565
00:33:11,089 --> 00:33:12,852
If you don't have
any underwear tomorrow,

566
00:33:12,924 --> 00:33:14,084
who are you gonna complain to?

567
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:15,750
Mom, I didn't have any underwear today.

568
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:17,260
Did you hear me even make a peep?

569
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:21,822
This sanctum is worse
than the Black Hole of Calcutta.

570
00:33:24,102 --> 00:33:26,229
She's always saying that.
Has she ever been to Calcutta?

571
00:33:26,304 --> 00:33:28,329
No.

572
00:33:28,406 --> 00:33:29,839
It's okay, Max.
It's safe.

573
00:33:29,907 --> 00:33:31,602
Max? Max?

574
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:36,209
I am dismayed.

575
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:41,445
I am deeply, deeply dismayed.

576
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:46,718
Now, can anyone guess why?

577
00:33:46,791 --> 00:33:48,656
Ethan.

578
00:33:48,726 --> 00:33:52,184
Would you care to hazard a guess?

579
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:55,958
I didn't think you would.

580
00:33:57,268 --> 00:34:00,669
Your essays, class, were execrable.

581
00:34:00,738 --> 00:34:02,569
All right!

582
00:34:03,941 --> 00:34:08,537
I am likening your work
to human bodily waste.

583
00:34:08,613 --> 00:34:11,207
With one notable exception.

584
00:34:12,617 --> 00:34:15,142
Impressive work, Mr. O'Roarke.

585
00:34:16,621 --> 00:34:21,456
Momentarily forgetting
your impoverished vocabularies,

586
00:34:21,526 --> 00:34:26,259
your misinterpretation
of historical facts...

587
00:34:27,799 --> 00:34:29,460
Allow me to cite an example.

588
00:34:29,534 --> 00:34:32,002
I will, however,

589
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:36,803
spare the unfortunate author.

590
00:34:36,874 --> 00:34:40,742
In selecting for a topic the Nixon years,

591
00:34:40,812 --> 00:34:44,270
our author shows a stunning naiveté.

592
00:34:46,117 --> 00:34:49,211
Now, none of you are
old enough to remember,

593
00:34:49,287 --> 00:34:53,314
as I do, how Nixon's
countrymen betrayed him.

594
00:34:53,391 --> 00:34:56,918
But was Richard Nixon

595
00:34:56,994 --> 00:35:00,054
really to blame?

596
00:35:00,131 --> 00:35:01,996
No.

597
00:35:02,066 --> 00:35:04,034
He was a target.

598
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:05,660
A victim.

599
00:35:05,736 --> 00:35:08,967
Campus radicals needed a scapegoat

600
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:12,305
to justify their own shoddy idealism.

601
00:35:13,478 --> 00:35:14,945
Mr. Hauser.

602
00:35:15,012 --> 00:35:16,877
You appear to be writhing in your seat.

603
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:18,415
Is this a nervous condition?

604
00:35:18,483 --> 00:35:19,882
Yes, it is.
It's a nervous condition.

605
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:20,918
What? No.

606
00:35:20,985 --> 00:35:24,318
No. It's not a nervous condition.

607
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:28,486
Mrs. Billings, I don't mean
to be rude, but...

608
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:30,493
no one destroyed President Nixon.

609
00:35:30,561 --> 00:35:31,823
The man destroyed himself.

610
00:35:31,896 --> 00:35:33,864
The secret bombings in Cambodia.

611
00:35:33,931 --> 00:35:36,126
He rigged a presidential election.

612
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,792
The media didn't create that.

613
00:35:37,869 --> 00:35:40,133
He put it down on tape.

614
00:35:41,739 --> 00:35:45,470
You're not old enough
to know who did what.

615
00:35:45,543 --> 00:35:46,976
That's my job.

616
00:35:47,044 --> 00:35:49,569
And the one thing I will not have

617
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:53,879
in my classroom is anarchy.

618
00:35:53,951 --> 00:35:55,646
Anarchy? The man lied.

619
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,688
He resigned in disgrace.

620
00:35:57,755 --> 00:36:00,451
Is it anarchy to discuss the facts?

621
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:05,090
Mr. Hauser, this is my classroom.

622
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:09,099
I decide what are and are not facts.

623
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:11,397
You, sir, are in my class.

624
00:36:11,469 --> 00:36:13,937
Please sit down.

625
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:18,567
Mrs. Billings, we're all adults here...

626
00:36:18,643 --> 00:36:22,101
I mean, you seem like
a fairly reasonable person.

627
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,842
I mean, really, is it your class

628
00:36:24,916 --> 00:36:27,407
or is it our class?

629
00:36:27,485 --> 00:36:30,318
It's her class, dick-brain.

630
00:36:33,991 --> 00:36:36,152
Sean?

631
00:36:36,227 --> 00:36:39,492
I didn't expect to see you
back in here so soon.

632
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:49,968
Thank you.

633
00:36:58,282 --> 00:36:59,909
Thanks.

634
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:04,110
It was that guy Max that did it.

635
00:37:04,188 --> 00:37:07,624
- Hey, Max.
- Yo, Max. What's up?

636
00:37:07,692 --> 00:37:11,128
Make a move, Morenski, and you're dead.

637
00:37:11,195 --> 00:37:12,526
What do you want?

638
00:37:12,597 --> 00:37:14,428
Your car keys and your credit cards.

639
00:37:14,498 --> 00:37:15,692
Patrick, that's not funny.

640
00:37:15,766 --> 00:37:16,892
Man, relax. I was just kidding.

641
00:37:16,968 --> 00:37:18,458
Max, how you doing?

642
00:37:20,004 --> 00:37:21,028
I don't get it, Patrick.

643
00:37:21,105 --> 00:37:22,595
People I don't know are talking to me.

644
00:37:22,673 --> 00:37:24,072
Hey, you asked for it.

645
00:37:24,141 --> 00:37:26,200
I mean, word is out.

646
00:37:26,277 --> 00:37:28,609
Hey, noble move, Maxwell.

647
00:37:28,679 --> 00:37:30,374
The man has definite potential.

648
00:37:30,448 --> 00:37:32,416
We should talk.
Know what I'm saying?

649
00:37:32,483 --> 00:37:34,451
Yo, bust a move, fellas.

650
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:41,383
I wish I could walk like that.

651
00:37:41,459 --> 00:37:43,927
Potential? What's he talking about?

652
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:47,454
It's no wonder young girls
are turning to bulimia.

653
00:37:47,531 --> 00:37:48,725
What is this stuff?

654
00:37:48,799 --> 00:37:50,266
You don't wanna know.

655
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:53,866
- Hi.
- Hi.

656
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:55,667
Oh, hi.

657
00:37:59,043 --> 00:37:59,873
Andrew...

658
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:01,172
- Max.
- Max.

659
00:38:01,245 --> 00:38:03,679
This is Chloe, and this is Ryan.

660
00:38:03,748 --> 00:38:06,740
Well, hello, Chloe and...

661
00:38:06,817 --> 00:38:08,512
- Ryan.
- Ryan.

662
00:38:09,754 --> 00:38:12,279
I heard you had to go see Dr. Gusick.
I'm really sorry about that.

663
00:38:12,356 --> 00:38:14,881
It's my fault.
It's my big mouth.

664
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:17,086
No, but I still owe you one.

665
00:38:17,161 --> 00:38:18,287
Why's that?

666
00:38:18,362 --> 00:38:20,227
You were defending my essay.

667
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:23,563
So you're the unfortunate author.

668
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:26,262
That's me. Better be careful.

669
00:38:26,337 --> 00:38:27,861
Please, sit down, sit down.

670
00:38:31,108 --> 00:38:32,837
Well, it sounded like
a really interesting essay.

671
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:35,140
I'd love to read it sometime.

672
00:38:35,212 --> 00:38:36,338
Yeah.

673
00:38:36,414 --> 00:38:39,076
He father was a pilot in Vietnam.

674
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:41,550
I hear his side of it all the time.

675
00:38:43,721 --> 00:38:46,246
Well, Maxwell, gotta motor.

676
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:48,417
There's a Dodge Aries K
out there with my name on it.

677
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:50,483
Hey, you stay off the streets, all right?

678
00:38:50,561 --> 00:38:52,188
- See you later, Ryan.
- Bye.

679
00:38:52,263 --> 00:38:54,663
Thanks, Patrick.

680
00:38:59,003 --> 00:38:59,992
Hi.

681
00:39:01,706 --> 00:39:04,607
If you'll excuse us.

682
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:07,075
Come on, Ryan.
I gotta go.

683
00:39:07,144 --> 00:39:10,272
Can I meet you later?

684
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:12,748
No, I have practice later.

685
00:39:12,817 --> 00:39:15,081
And after that I have
a campaign meeting. Come on.

686
00:39:15,152 --> 00:39:17,416
I'll be there in a little bit, okay?

687
00:39:17,488 --> 00:39:18,819
Yeah, sure.

688
00:39:18,889 --> 00:39:20,914
I'm outta here.

689
00:39:20,991 --> 00:39:23,721
Kevin.

690
00:39:23,794 --> 00:39:25,022
Me, too.

691
00:39:25,096 --> 00:39:26,791
I'll see you later, Ryan.

692
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:29,298
Wait up, Kev.

693
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:32,302
Did you really mean it,
that you want to read my essay?

694
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:34,565
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, I did.

695
00:39:34,638 --> 00:39:37,163
Here. But you have
to ignore all the red ink.

696
00:39:37,241 --> 00:39:39,436
Billings kinda had a field day
with the comments.

697
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:41,637
Wow.

698
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:44,010
<i>Wall Street Journal?</i>

699
00:39:44,081 --> 00:39:46,606
Not the usual literature
for an anarchist.

700
00:39:46,684 --> 00:39:50,484
Well, I'm not the usual anarchist.

701
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:54,221
I kinda sensed that.

702
00:39:54,291 --> 00:39:56,725
- Bye, Max.
- Bye-bye, Ryan.

703
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:03,899
Both hands.

704
00:40:03,968 --> 00:40:06,436
Two hands at all times.
Two hands.

705
00:40:06,504 --> 00:40:09,029
Slow down.

706
00:40:09,106 --> 00:40:11,131
Making a left. What's the drill?

707
00:40:11,208 --> 00:40:13,438
Signal, check the mirror,

708
00:40:13,511 --> 00:40:15,502
then when it's clear, make the move.

709
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:16,841
Give me a left.

710
00:40:20,317 --> 00:40:22,808
We're gonna be killed!

711
00:40:22,887 --> 00:40:24,479
Step on the brake!

712
00:40:24,555 --> 00:40:26,489
Stop it!

713
00:40:26,557 --> 00:40:27,615
Pull over!

714
00:40:27,691 --> 00:40:29,249
Look out for that car!

715
00:40:33,998 --> 00:40:35,295
Dude, man, let me out.

716
00:40:35,366 --> 00:40:37,459
Me, too, man.
I can't take any more of this.

717
00:40:37,535 --> 00:40:39,628
What? What?

718
00:40:39,703 --> 00:40:40,795
That wasn't even close.

719
00:40:40,871 --> 00:40:43,305
Patrick, just pull over!

720
00:40:52,983 --> 00:40:55,008
Senior class elections coming up.

721
00:40:55,085 --> 00:40:58,418
I'd like to remind you all
the nominations must be in

722
00:40:58,489 --> 00:41:01,219
by no later than this Friday.

723
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:02,657
Check with Ms. Billings...

724
00:41:03,894 --> 00:41:05,293
Maxwell!

725
00:41:05,362 --> 00:41:07,091
Check this out.

726
00:41:07,164 --> 00:41:08,995
I'm running your campaign, man.

727
00:41:09,066 --> 00:41:10,556
You're gonna take down O'Roarke.

728
00:41:10,634 --> 00:41:11,601
You know what I'm saying?

729
00:41:11,669 --> 00:41:12,863
Yeah.

730
00:41:12,937 --> 00:41:13,995
He's overwhelmed.

731
00:41:14,071 --> 00:41:15,197
I knew you'd dig it.

732
00:41:15,272 --> 00:41:16,569
No. No, I don't dig it.

733
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:19,006
Check it out.
These posters are only the beginning.

734
00:41:19,076 --> 00:41:20,441
You know what I'm saying?

735
00:41:20,511 --> 00:41:21,478
Yo, bust it!

736
00:41:25,783 --> 00:41:28,149
Now, vote for the man

737
00:41:28,219 --> 00:41:29,413
The man is Mad Max

738
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:30,954
Yes, he'll give us justice

739
00:41:31,021 --> 00:41:32,613
Abolish the tax

740
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:33,679
He'll make lunch longer

741
00:41:33,757 --> 00:41:34,985
And make the class shorter

742
00:41:35,059 --> 00:41:37,527
- We'll get Perrier
- Instead of water

743
00:41:37,595 --> 00:41:40,359
Now the dickhead O'Roarke
has been two years standing

744
00:41:40,431 --> 00:41:42,831
- Not listening to a word
- Of what we're demanding

745
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:45,733
- So the thing to do
- If you want big fun

746
00:41:45,803 --> 00:41:48,670
Just vote for Mad Max
'cause he's down with Clinton

747
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:52,438
I did mention that you might
not be interested.

748
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:54,410
Check it out.
We already put up half the posters.

749
00:41:54,478 --> 00:41:56,446
No, you can just take them down.

750
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:57,572
You should have asked me.

751
00:41:57,648 --> 00:42:00,173
I can get a little ahead of myself,
but that's me, that's the way I am.

752
00:42:00,251 --> 00:42:01,275
You know what I'm saying?

753
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:02,546
I have an idea.
Why don't you run?

754
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:03,848
Nah, man.
That's not my thing.

755
00:42:03,921 --> 00:42:05,286
My thing's behind the scenes.

756
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:07,290
See, I'm a mover, a motivator.
You know what I'm saying?

757
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:08,689
That's me. That's the way I am.

758
00:42:08,759 --> 00:42:10,522
This is me declining the nomination.

759
00:42:10,594 --> 00:42:12,357
I'm really honored, guys,
but, you know, that's me.

760
00:42:12,429 --> 00:42:14,454
- That's the way I am.
- You're a natural.

761
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:17,057
And just think of how good this gonna look
on your college application.

762
00:42:17,134 --> 00:42:20,365
And the girls... the girls
will be on you like white on rice.

763
00:42:20,437 --> 00:42:21,369
You know what I'm saying?

764
00:42:21,438 --> 00:42:23,998
The power thing... it's a turn on.

765
00:42:24,074 --> 00:42:26,338
Check it out.
Before you say no, answer me this.

766
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:27,468
You ever run before?

767
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:29,604
You've run before, Max, haven't you?

768
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:31,375
Recently, in fact.

769
00:42:31,448 --> 00:42:35,316
Listen, Kevin O'Roarke
been president for two years now.

770
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:37,946
This school needs some fresh blood.

771
00:42:38,022 --> 00:42:39,785
Believe me, my blood is not that fresh.

772
00:42:39,857 --> 00:42:42,223
You'd be surprised.

773
00:42:42,293 --> 00:42:46,787
Hey, that's my man Lamar in the gym
working on a pom-pom squad.

774
00:42:46,864 --> 00:42:48,354
You see, I'm a mover, a motivator.

775
00:42:48,432 --> 00:42:49,399
I'll catch you later.

776
00:42:49,466 --> 00:42:51,195
That's him That's the way he is.

777
00:42:51,268 --> 00:42:53,236
I'm absolutely not running.

778
00:42:53,304 --> 00:42:55,636
Check it out.
Save it for your campaign speech.

779
00:42:55,706 --> 00:42:56,673
Yo, bust a move, fellas.

780
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:57,900
- Tom P
- Deeski

781
00:42:57,975 --> 00:42:59,272
And Damien-D

782
00:42:59,343 --> 00:43:02,574
We make up the force of Clinton's party

783
00:43:05,516 --> 00:43:07,177
How do those guys do that?

784
00:43:10,888 --> 00:43:13,379
This is getting worse by the minute.

785
00:43:13,457 --> 00:43:15,357
The last time I picked up a girl
at her parents' house,

786
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:16,450
I can't even remember.

787
00:43:16,527 --> 00:43:18,017
That's how long ago it was.

788
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:19,357
Same as me.

789
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:21,591
I can't believe you set up a date with Ryan.

790
00:43:21,665 --> 00:43:23,257
I didn't. She set it up.

791
00:43:23,334 --> 00:43:24,494
How do I look?

792
00:43:24,568 --> 00:43:27,765
Well... here, try this.

793
00:43:27,838 --> 00:43:29,635
Patrick, I haven't the slightest idea

794
00:43:29,707 --> 00:43:31,766
what high school girls like to talk about.

795
00:43:31,842 --> 00:43:33,434
You're on your own there, Max.

796
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:35,910
They don't like to talk
to me about anything.

797
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:39,472
Patrick, maybe this tie is why.

798
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:40,676
Nah, I'm kidding. They will.

799
00:43:40,751 --> 00:43:41,843
Don't worry about it.

800
00:43:41,919 --> 00:43:43,716
I'm not worried about it.

801
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:47,245
I mean, all that's gonna change
as soon as I get my license.

802
00:43:47,324 --> 00:43:49,087
Of course, I don't have
a stack of credit cards

803
00:43:49,159 --> 00:43:51,992
or a decent stereo or a fine set of wheels.

804
00:43:52,062 --> 00:43:55,725
Or a mortgage or student loan payments
or lower-back pain.

805
00:43:55,799 --> 00:43:58,199
Believe me, you got
a lot to look forward to.

806
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:02,299
Anyway, it's not about all that stuff...
Oh, give me that.

807
00:44:02,373 --> 00:44:04,568
Just learn to be your true self.

808
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:06,576
My true self?

809
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:09,078
I'm talking to a guy who stole
his name off a coffee can.

810
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:10,477
Trust me on this, Patrick.

811
00:44:10,547 --> 00:44:12,037
I used to be exactly like you.

812
00:44:12,116 --> 00:44:15,381
I was a short, horny, hopeless dork.

813
00:44:15,452 --> 00:44:17,113
And look at you now.

814
00:44:17,187 --> 00:44:18,882
Well, I'm not short.

815
00:44:18,956 --> 00:44:22,915
Hey, good luck on your date tonight, Max.

816
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:24,085
I mean it.

817
00:44:24,161 --> 00:44:26,095
Thanks, Patrick.

818
00:44:26,163 --> 00:44:27,221
You little shit.

819
00:44:35,272 --> 00:44:38,264
Please, oh, please,
answer the door, Ryan.

820
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:40,674
The last thing I need
is to talk to this girl's father.

821
00:44:44,848 --> 00:44:47,282
Max? Hello.
I'm Ryan's father.

822
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:48,648
Come on in.

823
00:44:48,719 --> 00:44:50,346
Hi, sir.

824
00:44:55,459 --> 00:44:57,484
You can call me Bob.

825
00:44:57,561 --> 00:44:59,051
Listen, Ryan will be right down.

826
00:44:59,129 --> 00:45:00,221
What can I get for you?

827
00:45:00,297 --> 00:45:03,061
I'll take a Scotch and soda.

828
00:45:03,133 --> 00:45:05,363
Sorry, Bob! Bad joke!

829
00:45:05,436 --> 00:45:08,234
Just a soda.

830
00:45:08,305 --> 00:45:09,272
Just soda.

831
00:45:09,339 --> 00:45:11,136
Yeah, thanks.

832
00:45:12,643 --> 00:45:14,804
You have a lovely home here.

833
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:16,641
Thank you.

834
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:19,774
Stop it. You're sounding like Eddie Haskell.

835
00:45:25,956 --> 00:45:27,651
My hobby.

836
00:45:27,725 --> 00:45:29,590
Sorry.

837
00:45:31,428 --> 00:45:32,656
Just soda.

838
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:33,754
Thanks.

839
00:45:33,831 --> 00:45:35,321
Ryan.

840
00:45:37,935 --> 00:45:39,425
She's up there somewhere.

841
00:45:39,503 --> 00:45:41,095
Well, don't let me take you
away from anything.

842
00:45:41,171 --> 00:45:42,468
No, no, no.
It's all right.

843
00:45:42,539 --> 00:45:44,006
I'm just finishing up some paperwork,

844
00:45:44,074 --> 00:45:47,407
and this new tax code
has got me all screwed up.

845
00:45:47,478 --> 00:45:48,638
Oh, yeah, tell me about it.

846
00:45:48,712 --> 00:45:50,873
So are you taking
the standard deductions

847
00:45:50,948 --> 00:45:52,745
or are you itemizing?

848
00:45:52,816 --> 00:45:55,216
I'm itemizing.

849
00:45:55,285 --> 00:45:57,116
Well, then, let's take a look here.

850
00:46:00,491 --> 00:46:01,583
Okay, what about...

851
00:46:01,658 --> 00:46:03,387
Oh, yeah, you got that one.

852
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:05,951
But what about this loss here?

853
00:46:06,029 --> 00:46:09,487
You see, you can offset
the dividend income there.

854
00:46:09,566 --> 00:46:12,399
Wow! I missed that.

855
00:46:12,469 --> 00:46:14,630
Yeah, that's like...
that's like a thousand bucks right there.

856
00:46:18,308 --> 00:46:21,471
you're in the same classes with Ryan?

857
00:46:21,545 --> 00:46:22,978
- I am.
- Hi.

858
00:46:23,046 --> 00:46:24,411
Oh, hi.

859
00:46:24,481 --> 00:46:25,880
You guys getting along okay?

860
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:27,644
Great.

861
00:46:27,718 --> 00:46:28,844
Good.

862
00:46:30,387 --> 00:46:31,411
Okay. Ready?

863
00:46:31,488 --> 00:46:32,614
Oh, listen, wait.

864
00:46:32,689 --> 00:46:35,283
Ryan, I wanna treat you guys.

865
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:36,656
Here's some cash.

866
00:46:36,727 --> 00:46:37,955
Really?

867
00:46:38,028 --> 00:46:40,087
Really.

868
00:46:40,164 --> 00:46:41,597
Great. Okay. See you later.

869
00:46:41,665 --> 00:46:43,599
- Tell Mom I'll be home early.
- Okay, I will.

870
00:46:43,667 --> 00:46:46,830
Nice meeting you, Bob... sir.

871
00:46:49,473 --> 00:46:51,498
Boy, that was weird.

872
00:46:51,575 --> 00:46:53,873
20 minutes ago, he was screaming
about the heating bill.

873
00:46:53,944 --> 00:46:55,070
Oh, yeah?

874
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:57,079
I have good news.

875
00:46:57,147 --> 00:46:58,375
I found out today.

876
00:46:58,448 --> 00:47:00,973
University of lowa.
I got an early admission.

877
00:47:01,051 --> 00:47:02,279
Oh, great! That's, uh...

878
00:47:02,352 --> 00:47:04,217
That's terrific.

879
00:47:04,288 --> 00:47:05,721
What about you?
Where are you gonna go?

880
00:47:05,789 --> 00:47:08,121
I don't know yet.
I haven't heard.

881
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:12,057
- Allow me.
- Okay.

882
00:47:12,129 --> 00:47:13,255
Iowa, huh?

883
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:14,297
Ever been there?

884
00:47:14,364 --> 00:47:15,922
No.

885
00:47:15,999 --> 00:47:18,024
I know it's where they grow potatoes.

886
00:47:18,101 --> 00:47:19,329
Corn.

887
00:47:19,403 --> 00:47:20,836
Yeah, I knew that.

888
00:47:20,904 --> 00:47:22,895
Yeah.

889
00:47:22,973 --> 00:47:24,600
Are you ready for the Jersey Jet?

890
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:26,165
I don't know.

891
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,011
Okay.

892
00:47:33,483 --> 00:47:35,417
So, where are we going?

893
00:47:35,485 --> 00:47:37,419
I leave it entirely in your hands.

894
00:47:37,487 --> 00:47:38,954
It's your town.

895
00:47:39,022 --> 00:47:40,683
Okay.

896
00:47:45,162 --> 00:47:46,561
Where'd you get this car?

897
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:48,655
My mom drove it when she was in college.

898
00:47:48,732 --> 00:47:51,530
Original brakes, original transmission.

899
00:47:51,602 --> 00:47:53,399
You know, I still have my original feet.

900
00:47:53,470 --> 00:47:55,665
Maybe we ought to walk.

901
00:48:10,487 --> 00:48:11,977
Okay, come on.

902
00:48:23,967 --> 00:48:26,765
You can do it, Max.
Okay, come on.

903
00:48:26,837 --> 00:48:28,270
You can do it alone, Max.

904
00:48:41,285 --> 00:48:43,583
Okay, come on.

905
00:48:43,654 --> 00:48:45,519
Max! Max!

906
00:48:55,299 --> 00:48:56,561
Thanks.

907
00:49:06,677 --> 00:49:08,008
Max, do you need a hand?

908
00:49:08,078 --> 00:49:10,069
Nah, I'm going good now.

909
00:49:11,648 --> 00:49:13,206
Oh, watch out.

910
00:49:16,253 --> 00:49:17,481
Okay.

911
00:49:17,554 --> 00:49:19,249
- Yeah.
- Oh, Max.

912
00:49:19,323 --> 00:49:20,847
You wanted mustard, right?

913
00:49:20,924 --> 00:49:24,655
Actually, I like ketchup.

914
00:49:26,129 --> 00:49:27,790
Oh, no, wait.

915
00:49:27,864 --> 00:49:29,525
Here, I'll go get it.
Max, I'll go get it.

916
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:31,430
- It's okay.
- Thanks.

917
00:49:34,771 --> 00:49:38,036
Everyone, clear the floor, please.

918
00:49:38,108 --> 00:49:41,339
Your next number will be ladies' choice.

919
00:49:41,411 --> 00:49:44,073
Couples.

920
00:50:01,365 --> 00:50:03,993
Would you believe I haven't
been on skates in 15 years?

921
00:50:04,067 --> 00:50:05,898
Yeah, I believe it.

922
00:50:05,969 --> 00:50:08,961
Wait. That means the last time
you skated, you were two?

923
00:50:09,039 --> 00:50:11,166
I wasn't even very good then.

924
00:50:12,809 --> 00:50:15,642
Try bending your knees.
It'll help.

925
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:19,444
So, you come here often with Kevin?

926
00:50:19,516 --> 00:50:20,483
Hardly ever.

927
00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:22,643
He's very concerned about being cool.

928
00:50:22,719 --> 00:50:24,778
Wait a minute.
You mean this isn't cool?

929
00:50:24,855 --> 00:50:25,787
I'm outta here.

930
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:28,518
Get back here.

931
00:50:28,592 --> 00:50:30,753
Where you're from,
do you have a girlfriend?

932
00:50:31,762 --> 00:50:34,094
As a matter of fact, I do.

933
00:50:34,164 --> 00:50:35,961
Well, I did.

934
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:37,398
We were together for three years

935
00:50:37,467 --> 00:50:39,230
and came this close to getting married.

936
00:50:39,302 --> 00:50:41,031
Really?

937
00:50:41,104 --> 00:50:43,072
Yeah, she was my skating instructor.

938
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:44,801
You can see why we broke up.

939
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:46,900
Max!

940
00:51:18,675 --> 00:51:21,041
Looks like you made
an real impression on my father.

941
00:51:21,111 --> 00:51:22,305
Oh, yeah, he's terrific.

942
00:51:22,379 --> 00:51:25,143
I think I broke one of his planes, though.

943
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:29,810
What about you?
What are your parents like?

944
00:51:30,821 --> 00:51:34,120
I lost them in a car accident
when I was very young.

945
00:51:34,191 --> 00:51:37,024
I was raised by my grandmother.

946
00:51:37,094 --> 00:51:38,356
Max, I'm sorry.

947
00:51:38,428 --> 00:51:41,261
Oh, no, it's okay.

948
00:51:41,331 --> 00:51:43,424
Really, it is.

949
00:51:52,843 --> 00:51:54,367
I'll drop you off at your house.

950
00:51:54,444 --> 00:51:56,071
No. Actually, it's such a nice night,

951
00:51:56,146 --> 00:51:57,704
I think I'll... I think I'll walk.

952
00:51:57,781 --> 00:51:58,805
It's no problem.

953
00:51:58,882 --> 00:52:00,042
No, actually. Right here.

954
00:52:00,117 --> 00:52:01,209
Right here's fine. This corner.

955
00:52:01,284 --> 00:52:03,514
- Right here?
- Yeah. Yeah.

956
00:52:03,587 --> 00:52:05,316
Okay.

957
00:52:07,124 --> 00:52:08,284
Well...

958
00:52:10,327 --> 00:52:11,453
Well...

959
00:52:13,296 --> 00:52:15,093
I had a great time.

960
00:52:17,134 --> 00:52:18,624
Me, too.

961
00:52:21,304 --> 00:52:22,896
So...

962
00:52:22,973 --> 00:52:26,067
Is something wrong?

963
00:52:26,143 --> 00:52:29,271
Actually, there is something
I have to tell you.

964
00:52:29,346 --> 00:52:31,337
What is it?

965
00:52:33,216 --> 00:52:37,380
I... think I'm coming down with a cold.

966
00:52:38,889 --> 00:52:40,914
A cold?

967
00:52:40,991 --> 00:52:44,825
Yeah, I'm very paranoid about germs.

968
00:52:44,895 --> 00:52:46,328
Not me.

969
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:50,626
Bye, Max.

970
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:51,632
Bye, Ryan.

971
00:52:51,701 --> 00:52:53,396
See you in school.

972
00:52:53,470 --> 00:52:54,994
Yeah.

973
00:52:57,641 --> 00:52:59,108
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

974
00:53:34,945 --> 00:53:36,776
Over you

975
00:53:36,846 --> 00:53:38,973
Cry...

976
00:53:39,049 --> 00:53:41,381
Jesus! Patrick!

977
00:53:41,451 --> 00:53:43,942
- I told you not to do that anymore!
- Sorry.

978
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:45,510
That must have been some date.

979
00:53:45,589 --> 00:53:46,715
What's all the hubbub, bub?

980
00:53:46,790 --> 00:53:48,690
G-men, that's all the hubbub, bub.

981
00:53:48,758 --> 00:53:50,988
I'm in trouble, Patrick.
I got a real problem.

982
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:52,289
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

983
00:53:52,362 --> 00:53:54,592
I was expecting nothing,
but she's really wonderful.

984
00:53:54,664 --> 00:53:56,495
I could look at her face the rest of my life.

985
00:53:56,566 --> 00:53:58,591
The rest of your life
may not add up to much, pal.

986
00:53:58,668 --> 00:54:01,000
And she likes me, too,
no question about it.

987
00:54:01,071 --> 00:54:02,902
Do the words "statutory rape" ring a bell?

988
00:54:02,973 --> 00:54:04,304
Hey, I was a perfect gentleman,

989
00:54:04,374 --> 00:54:05,807
and believe me, it wasn't easy.

990
00:54:05,875 --> 00:54:07,809
You should have jumped her
while you're still a free man.

991
00:54:07,877 --> 00:54:11,643
Come on, I gotta show you something.
Come on, get up. Get up.

992
00:54:11,715 --> 00:54:13,376
Come on.

993
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:18,817
Look.

994
00:54:19,823 --> 00:54:21,450
- Bakey.
- Down.

995
00:54:24,027 --> 00:54:25,585
Right now, there's two dozen
Efrem Zimbalist, Jrs.

996
00:54:25,662 --> 00:54:27,892
eating cheese and crackers
in my living room.

997
00:54:27,964 --> 00:54:30,432
You never saw so much polyester
in such a confined space.

998
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:33,025
- What are they doing here?
- You're such a smart guy.

999
00:54:33,103 --> 00:54:34,570
Where are you getting
all your money from?

1000
00:54:34,638 --> 00:54:36,503
There's a bank machine over on...

1001
00:54:36,573 --> 00:54:38,438
Oh, my God, the bank machine!

1002
00:54:38,508 --> 00:54:40,271
It's all on the computer!

1003
00:54:40,343 --> 00:54:43,608
Luckily for you, they're looking
for Andrew, not Max.

1004
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:45,545
Oh, yeah. I guess
the prison accommodations

1005
00:54:45,615 --> 00:54:47,048
just aren't gonna do it.

1006
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:48,482
I got that covered.

1007
00:54:48,551 --> 00:54:49,711
Come on.

1008
00:54:49,786 --> 00:54:51,117
Lead on, Rambo.

1009
00:55:09,539 --> 00:55:11,837
Crying

1010
00:55:11,908 --> 00:55:14,103
Over you

1011
00:55:14,177 --> 00:55:16,304
Crying

1012
00:55:16,379 --> 00:55:18,574
Over you

1013
00:55:18,648 --> 00:55:20,582
Patrick.

1014
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:22,584
It's not a rap song.

1015
00:55:24,621 --> 00:55:27,021
I don't believe this.
You got keys to this joint?

1016
00:55:27,090 --> 00:55:29,149
Well, my mom's the school nurse.

1017
00:55:29,225 --> 00:55:32,285
I got the run of the place.

1018
00:55:32,362 --> 00:55:33,852
You may find this amazing, Patrick,

1019
00:55:33,930 --> 00:55:36,660
but there was a time
when I wanted to be a teacher.

1020
00:55:36,733 --> 00:55:39,827
As a matter of fact, that's what it said
in my first high school yearbook.

1021
00:55:39,903 --> 00:55:40,892
Really?

1022
00:55:40,970 --> 00:55:43,939
Why would someone wanna
work so hard and get paid so little?

1023
00:55:44,007 --> 00:55:47,534
Well, money's not that important.

1024
00:55:47,610 --> 00:55:48,702
This girl really got to you.

1025
00:55:48,778 --> 00:55:50,939
I mean, you're delirious.

1026
00:55:52,182 --> 00:55:56,243
Well, look, I'd better get back
before the G-men start asking questions.

1027
00:55:56,319 --> 00:55:57,752
Oh, by the way,
Dr. Gusick's office...

1028
00:55:57,821 --> 00:55:59,220
- Yeah, the shrink?
- Right.

1029
00:55:59,289 --> 00:56:01,314
It's got a really nice couch.
I mean, plush Naugahyde.

1030
00:56:01,391 --> 00:56:02,517
- You can sleep there.
- Yeah, I know.

1031
00:56:02,592 --> 00:56:05,117
I spent some time on it last week.

1032
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:07,789
Well, here.

1033
00:56:07,864 --> 00:56:10,264
You gonna be okay?

1034
00:56:10,333 --> 00:56:12,198
Yeah.

1035
00:56:12,268 --> 00:56:14,031
Thanks, Patrick.

1036
00:56:17,407 --> 00:56:20,570
Crying

1037
00:56:22,045 --> 00:56:25,105
Over you

1038
00:56:25,181 --> 00:56:28,116
Crying

1039
00:56:48,805 --> 00:56:50,932
The doctor is out.

1040
00:57:25,275 --> 00:57:26,503
Testing.

1041
00:57:30,346 --> 00:57:32,974
Calling all cars.
Calling all cars.

1042
00:57:33,049 --> 00:57:35,779
Be on the lookout
for a white male Caucasian.

1043
00:57:35,852 --> 00:57:38,252
Age unknown.

1044
00:57:41,191 --> 00:57:43,125
This is President Maxwell

1045
00:57:43,193 --> 00:57:45,923
coming to you live
from the Oval Office.

1046
00:57:45,995 --> 00:57:48,429
And I don't have a pass.

1047
00:57:48,498 --> 00:57:49,590
Teachers...

1048
00:57:49,666 --> 00:57:52,499
where are your passes?

1049
00:57:57,273 --> 00:57:58,501
Wow!

1050
00:58:17,627 --> 00:58:22,087
Teachers, I wanna see
some changes around here.

1051
00:58:22,165 --> 00:58:24,827
Now, class?
Way too long.

1052
00:58:24,901 --> 00:58:27,995
Come on, you can sort out
the major points in 15 minutes.

1053
00:58:28,071 --> 00:58:29,436
Be real.

1054
00:58:29,506 --> 00:58:30,700
Out goes the dress code.

1055
00:58:36,412 --> 00:58:38,277
Well, he wants to take his time.

1056
00:58:38,348 --> 00:58:39,838
He's romantic.
I think it's sweet.

1057
00:58:41,251 --> 00:58:43,719
I don't think it's sweet.

1058
00:58:43,786 --> 00:58:45,185
I think it's suspicious.

1059
00:58:45,255 --> 00:58:46,654
Ryan!

1060
00:58:48,391 --> 00:58:51,485
I pledge allegiance to the flag

1061
00:58:51,561 --> 00:58:54,052
of the United States of America

1062
00:58:54,130 --> 00:58:57,031
and to the republic for which it stands,

1063
00:58:57,100 --> 00:59:01,196
one nation, under God, indivisible,

1064
00:59:01,271 --> 00:59:03,865
with liberty and justice for all.

1065
00:59:06,342 --> 00:59:09,243
We'll have the venison
and the pheasant, please.

1066
00:59:09,312 --> 00:59:12,873
Okay, let's talk for
a moment about roaches.

1067
00:59:12,949 --> 00:59:15,008
Can we get the shop class
to start building a few motels?

1068
00:59:15,084 --> 00:59:16,915
You got a real problem here.

1069
00:59:16,986 --> 00:59:18,453
Thank you.

1070
00:59:18,521 --> 00:59:20,512
- You approve?
- Yes!

1071
00:59:20,590 --> 00:59:22,956
Pierre, the wine list, please?

1072
00:59:23,026 --> 00:59:24,755
And in the future,

1073
00:59:24,827 --> 00:59:27,193
report cards will be given
by students to teachers.

1074
00:59:42,612 --> 00:59:45,274
And that's just the beginning.

1075
00:59:45,348 --> 00:59:47,475
I am for progressive education.

1076
00:59:47,550 --> 00:59:49,609
So watch out.

1077
01:00:42,839 --> 01:00:44,830
What are you doing
sneaking around in here?

1078
01:00:44,907 --> 01:00:47,137
You're the...
You're the janitor.

1079
01:00:47,210 --> 01:00:49,144
Custodial engineer.

1080
01:00:49,212 --> 01:00:50,543
Ezzard Williams.

1081
01:00:50,613 --> 01:00:52,444
And you're Mad Max.

1082
01:00:52,515 --> 01:00:55,382
I've seen you in here
every night for weeks, boy.

1083
01:00:55,451 --> 01:00:58,249
This is a high school,
not a Holiday Inn.

1084
01:00:58,321 --> 01:00:59,253
Tell me about it.

1085
01:00:59,322 --> 01:01:01,756
Ezzard...

1086
01:01:01,824 --> 01:01:03,724
you got any more of that stuff?

1087
01:01:05,128 --> 01:01:06,652
Hell, come on.

1088
01:01:06,729 --> 01:01:08,856
I ain't supposed to be in here, either.

1089
01:01:11,834 --> 01:01:13,597
Getting pretty good on these things, boy.

1090
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:14,864
Thanks.

1091
01:01:17,006 --> 01:01:18,564
So...

1092
01:01:18,641 --> 01:01:20,370
you're an ex-boxer, huh?

1093
01:01:20,443 --> 01:01:22,673
You don't get a nose like this

1094
01:01:22,745 --> 01:01:25,305
mopping high school hallways.

1095
01:01:25,381 --> 01:01:27,781
There, that's one of me.

1096
01:01:27,850 --> 01:01:29,579
Sparring with Hurricane Jackson.

1097
01:01:29,652 --> 01:01:32,985
Steel Pier.
Atlantic City, New Jersey.

1098
01:01:34,290 --> 01:01:35,518
Still got the fast hands.

1099
01:01:35,591 --> 01:01:37,218
Quick combination.

1100
01:01:37,293 --> 01:01:39,056
Get away. Get away. Stop it.

1101
01:01:39,128 --> 01:01:40,993
But I had to quit the ring.

1102
01:01:41,064 --> 01:01:42,725
Tried working the corner.

1103
01:01:42,799 --> 01:01:44,323
Couldn't dig that, though.

1104
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:47,858
But you find other things to do.

1105
01:01:47,937 --> 01:01:52,271
One thing I can smell
with all of this is bullshit.

1106
01:01:52,341 --> 01:01:55,936
Hiding out, sneaking around,

1107
01:01:56,012 --> 01:01:57,946
tearing down your own posters.

1108
01:01:58,014 --> 01:01:59,311
I've been watching you.

1109
01:01:59,382 --> 01:02:01,247
Now, who are you, boy?

1110
01:02:07,924 --> 01:02:09,915
Well, Ezzard...

1111
01:02:12,895 --> 01:02:17,127
You are looking at a wanted man.

1112
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:18,827
You don't say.

1113
01:02:20,002 --> 01:02:23,529
You don't get a nose
like this breaking stocks.

1114
01:02:23,606 --> 01:02:25,233
I'm a stockbroker, damn it!

1115
01:02:25,308 --> 01:02:28,141
What is in this stuff?
This has a lot of poof in it.

1116
01:02:29,512 --> 01:02:31,673
These high school kids...

1117
01:02:31,748 --> 01:02:34,444
Have you noticed this?
They're so...

1118
01:02:34,517 --> 01:02:35,643
Am I crazy?

1119
01:02:35,718 --> 01:02:37,743
They seem so young.

1120
01:02:39,555 --> 01:02:41,546
You're the guy they're looking for
in the newspaper

1121
01:02:41,624 --> 01:02:42,921
from up there in Boston.

1122
01:02:42,992 --> 01:02:44,425
You're him!

1123
01:02:44,494 --> 01:02:46,587
How you like that?

1124
01:02:46,662 --> 01:02:49,187
I don't.

1125
01:02:52,869 --> 01:02:54,962
Here's to you, Max.

1126
01:02:56,005 --> 01:02:57,097
Or whoever you are.

1127
01:03:01,110 --> 01:03:05,171
Ezzard. Ezzard,
why are you living here?

1128
01:03:05,248 --> 01:03:06,340
Don't these people pay you?

1129
01:03:06,415 --> 01:03:09,009
Sure, but I'm moving next year.

1130
01:03:09,085 --> 01:03:10,677
My buddy Red and me,

1131
01:03:10,753 --> 01:03:14,917
we gonna open us a donut franchise
in San Diego, California.

1132
01:03:14,991 --> 01:03:17,755
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, a Donut Castle.

1133
01:03:19,462 --> 01:03:20,520
I love do...

1134
01:03:20,596 --> 01:03:22,689
Okay. Okay.

1135
01:03:25,802 --> 01:03:29,033
Red's already out there,
so I'm trying to save up my money.

1136
01:03:29,105 --> 01:03:31,903
- How have you got it invested?
- Savings account.

1137
01:03:31,974 --> 01:03:34,067
- A passbook?
- Yeah.

1138
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:36,976
Ezzard, we gotta sit you down, dude.

1139
01:03:37,046 --> 01:03:40,106
There's stock, bonds, high-yield CDs,

1140
01:03:40,183 --> 01:03:41,514
American Drainpipe.

1141
01:03:41,584 --> 01:03:43,142
Don't you worry about me.
Come on.

1142
01:03:43,219 --> 01:03:45,483
I don't like giving stock tips anyway.

1143
01:03:45,555 --> 01:03:46,681
Where are we going?

1144
01:03:46,756 --> 01:03:49,782
You can pretty well set yourself up in here
and not worry about being seen.

1145
01:03:55,298 --> 01:03:56,822
Thanks, Ezzard.

1146
01:04:00,570 --> 01:04:03,971
You should sleep like a lump of coal in here.

1147
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:05,905
Good night, Ezzard.

1148
01:04:07,844 --> 01:04:10,142
- American Drainpipe.
- Yeah, Max.

1149
01:04:10,213 --> 01:04:11,908
American Drainpipe.

1150
01:04:15,318 --> 01:04:18,549
Hey, I've been reading all the stock pages
you've been leaving around.

1151
01:04:18,621 --> 01:04:20,248
It's interesting.

1152
01:04:20,323 --> 01:04:21,915
Hey, mac.

1153
01:04:21,991 --> 01:04:23,925
Hey, I'm talking to you.

1154
01:04:23,993 --> 01:04:25,927
What's the matter?

1155
01:04:25,995 --> 01:04:28,327
I don't believe it.

1156
01:04:28,397 --> 01:04:30,126
Ahern... They brought him to the stand,

1157
01:04:30,199 --> 01:04:32,394
and he refused to answer
any of their questions.

1158
01:04:32,468 --> 01:04:33,628
He clammed up.

1159
01:04:33,703 --> 01:04:35,398
What, cat got his tongue?

1160
01:04:35,471 --> 01:04:37,098
Yeah.

1161
01:04:37,173 --> 01:04:39,038
Cat named Kapados.

1162
01:04:40,376 --> 01:04:42,003
Yo, Max!

1163
01:04:42,078 --> 01:04:44,308
Hey, hey, Maxwell, guess what.

1164
01:04:44,380 --> 01:04:47,349
You are not the only one with a date.

1165
01:04:47,416 --> 01:04:49,281
Yeah, that's great.

1166
01:04:49,352 --> 01:04:50,284
By then, I'll have it.

1167
01:04:50,353 --> 01:04:51,547
I'll have my driver's permit.

1168
01:04:51,621 --> 01:04:53,555
Yo, wake up, Max.
This is major shit.

1169
01:04:53,623 --> 01:04:54,715
It was so simple.

1170
01:04:54,790 --> 01:04:57,884
I just got the girl on the line and said,
"Yo, baby, you and me, Friday night.

1171
01:04:57,960 --> 01:04:58,892
Be there. Period."

1172
01:04:58,961 --> 01:05:01,930
She said yes.
It was unbelievable.

1173
01:05:03,466 --> 01:05:05,627
Hey, check out the 'do, Max.

1174
01:05:05,701 --> 01:05:06,998
Clinton went to work on my head.

1175
01:05:07,069 --> 01:05:08,434
You like?

1176
01:05:08,504 --> 01:05:10,802
Oh, yeah. It's great.

1177
01:05:10,873 --> 01:05:11,999
Listen, man, I'm outta here.

1178
01:05:12,074 --> 01:05:13,735
I got some serious campaigning to do.
Later, man.

1179
01:05:16,045 --> 01:05:17,342
What's the problem?

1180
01:05:17,413 --> 01:05:19,472
Patrick, I can't take this anymore.

1181
01:05:19,548 --> 01:05:20,810
What are you talking about?

1182
01:05:20,883 --> 01:05:23,147
Hey, you're Mr. Popularity, man.

1183
01:05:23,219 --> 01:05:25,050
Everyone's gonna be
out there voting for you.

1184
01:05:25,121 --> 01:05:26,884
I keep thinking about
Rodriguez and Pratt.

1185
01:05:26,956 --> 01:05:28,150
I haven't slept in weeks.

1186
01:05:28,224 --> 01:05:30,283
Take my advice.
Just start boning up for the S.A.T.s.

1187
01:05:35,932 --> 01:05:39,026
Mr. O'Roarke, I'd like a word with you.

1188
01:05:45,174 --> 01:05:46,766
What do you think?

1189
01:05:46,842 --> 01:05:49,003
Do you expect to win Tuesday?

1190
01:05:49,078 --> 01:05:52,445
I've got my doubts.

1191
01:05:52,515 --> 01:05:55,211
Good old Clinton's been all over school
drumming up support for Max.

1192
01:05:55,284 --> 01:05:57,411
You never know.

1193
01:05:57,486 --> 01:06:01,354
Support can come from
very unexpected quarters.

1194
01:06:01,424 --> 01:06:04,086
I'm the chairperson
of the Tellers Committee.

1195
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:06,094
We count the ballots.

1196
01:06:06,162 --> 01:06:07,094
Ms. Billings...

1197
01:06:07,163 --> 01:06:08,824
Now, I would love to chat with you,

1198
01:06:08,898 --> 01:06:14,700
but I have so-called
"parent conferences" all afternoon.

1199
01:06:14,770 --> 01:06:16,431
That's nice, Ms. Billings,
really, but I don't want...

1200
01:06:16,505 --> 01:06:19,770
Honey, save the gratitude.

1201
01:06:27,717 --> 01:06:29,446
I'll just put the kettle on.

1202
01:06:29,518 --> 01:06:32,043
- You can come right through here.
- Thank you.

1203
01:06:32,121 --> 01:06:33,486
You would call immediately

1204
01:06:33,556 --> 01:06:35,285
if you were to hear
from Andrew, wouldn't you?

1205
01:06:35,358 --> 01:06:37,121
Did you say you wanted tea?

1206
01:06:37,193 --> 01:06:42,392
Did you, Mrs. Morenski, hear from him?

1207
01:06:42,465 --> 01:06:45,059
It's important.
Please. Think.

1208
01:06:45,134 --> 01:06:46,328
Did I?

1209
01:06:46,402 --> 01:06:49,269
Oh, yes, he did call.

1210
01:06:49,338 --> 01:06:50,430
Very good.

1211
01:06:50,506 --> 01:06:53,202
Now, can you tell me when?

1212
01:06:53,275 --> 01:06:55,573
Did he say where he was?

1213
01:06:55,644 --> 01:06:58,545
Honey Boy said that he was in his office.

1214
01:06:58,614 --> 01:07:00,548
That's downtown on State Street.

1215
01:07:00,616 --> 01:07:01,810
He's got his own window.

1216
01:07:01,884 --> 01:07:03,351
What do you call him?

1217
01:07:03,419 --> 01:07:05,353
Honey Boy.

1218
01:07:05,421 --> 01:07:07,946
He hasn't been in his office for weeks.

1219
01:07:08,024 --> 01:07:10,891
Inspector... What was the name again?

1220
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:13,428
Richardson.

1221
01:07:13,496 --> 01:07:15,589
Did I tell you that
I knew a Richardson once

1222
01:07:15,664 --> 01:07:17,188
when I lived in...

1223
01:07:17,266 --> 01:07:18,392
Where was it?

1224
01:07:18,467 --> 01:07:20,526
Providence, I believe.

1225
01:07:20,603 --> 01:07:23,003
Frankie Richardson.

1226
01:07:23,072 --> 01:07:24,334
I was very young.

1227
01:07:24,407 --> 01:07:26,773
Andrew? When did he call?

1228
01:07:26,842 --> 01:07:30,005
It wasn't Andrew.
I have other grandchildren.

1229
01:07:30,079 --> 01:07:32,206
It must have been...

1230
01:07:32,281 --> 01:07:34,511
I can't recall now.

1231
01:07:34,583 --> 01:07:36,107
I'll just get the tea.

1232
01:07:42,691 --> 01:07:44,488
Are all these photos of your family?

1233
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:47,495
Yes. Yes, they are.

1234
01:07:47,563 --> 01:07:48,928
Are they close by?

1235
01:07:51,267 --> 01:07:52,825
I hardly ever see them.

1236
01:08:10,953 --> 01:08:13,353
What's that thing called?

1237
01:08:13,422 --> 01:08:15,856
Whiplash.

1238
01:08:18,194 --> 01:08:20,754
That looks really uncomfortable.

1239
01:08:20,830 --> 01:08:22,525
It is.

1240
01:08:22,598 --> 01:08:24,828
Look, Mr. Lessig,

1241
01:08:24,900 --> 01:08:26,993
maybe this isn't the best time
for me to take my test.

1242
01:08:27,069 --> 01:08:28,229
Get in.

1243
01:08:42,852 --> 01:08:44,752
Start your engine.

1244
01:08:50,493 --> 01:08:53,121
You think that maybe we could
at least talk about this a little?

1245
01:08:53,195 --> 01:08:55,390
Kevin, we've said all there is
to say, haven't we?

1246
01:08:55,464 --> 01:08:57,329
No. Ryan, what's with you?

1247
01:08:57,399 --> 01:09:00,459
I've never seen you act like this before.

1248
01:09:00,536 --> 01:09:02,094
Ryan.

1249
01:09:02,171 --> 01:09:05,504
Tell... Ryan, look, I'm telling you.

1250
01:09:05,574 --> 01:09:08,475
You're acting like an idiot
behaving like this.

1251
01:09:08,544 --> 01:09:10,341
Because we're not going out anymore?

1252
01:09:10,412 --> 01:09:12,744
No, because you trust Hauser, don't you?

1253
01:09:12,815 --> 01:09:15,545
- Yeah. So what?
- Yeah, so where's he from?

1254
01:09:15,618 --> 01:09:17,518
I happened to be in the office yesterday,

1255
01:09:17,586 --> 01:09:19,451
and I looked up a couple of things.

1256
01:09:19,522 --> 01:09:20,784
You what?

1257
01:09:20,856 --> 01:09:24,019
- Where did he tell you he was from?
- He's from Boston.

1258
01:09:24,093 --> 01:09:25,890
That's not what it said in his file.

1259
01:09:25,961 --> 01:09:27,155
It said he was from Texas.

1260
01:09:27,229 --> 01:09:31,097
Well, they made a mistake.

1261
01:09:31,167 --> 01:09:33,362
Kevin, I can't believe you spied on him.

1262
01:09:33,435 --> 01:09:36,302
Hey, Ryan, all I'm telling you
is you better not trust the guy.

1263
01:09:36,372 --> 01:09:38,272
I know something's funny.

1264
01:09:42,111 --> 01:09:43,271
I checked my mirror.

1265
01:09:43,345 --> 01:09:45,370
I did everything right, theoretically.

1266
01:09:45,447 --> 01:09:47,381
I wish there was some way
I could talk to Ahern,

1267
01:09:47,449 --> 01:09:48,746
maybe see what happened.

1268
01:09:48,817 --> 01:09:50,011
My life is over.

1269
01:09:50,085 --> 01:09:52,110
My life isn't in that terrific shape, either.

1270
01:09:52,188 --> 01:09:53,678
I know my bathroom cabinet.

1271
01:09:53,756 --> 01:09:55,986
There's no razor, no Valium, nothing.

1272
01:09:56,058 --> 01:09:57,355
There's a full jar of chewable Flintstones.

1273
01:09:57,426 --> 01:09:58,859
- It's a large jar.
- Patrick, come on!

1274
01:09:58,928 --> 01:10:00,088
What kind of problem is this?

1275
01:10:00,162 --> 01:10:01,720
Cool it, okay?

1276
01:10:01,797 --> 01:10:03,196
I waited ten years for this day.

1277
01:10:03,265 --> 01:10:04,425
So? You can take it again.

1278
01:10:04,500 --> 01:10:05,831
Sure, just like that.

1279
01:10:05,901 --> 01:10:07,892
Listen, I got serious problems, all right?

1280
01:10:07,970 --> 01:10:09,665
To you they're serious.

1281
01:10:09,738 --> 01:10:12,002
You're always such a wiseguy.
Everything with you is a joke.

1282
01:10:12,074 --> 01:10:13,268
Everything is negative.

1283
01:10:13,342 --> 01:10:15,572
You spend so much time
worrying about yourself.

1284
01:10:15,644 --> 01:10:17,339
Who are you worrying about, Maxwell?

1285
01:10:17,413 --> 01:10:19,074
It's a little different.
Nobody's trying to kill you.

1286
01:10:19,148 --> 01:10:20,137
All right, forget it.

1287
01:10:20,216 --> 01:10:21,649
You got your troubles
and I got mine, okay?

1288
01:10:21,717 --> 01:10:24,311
So why don't you have a little perspective
and maybe grow up a little?

1289
01:10:24,386 --> 01:10:25,546
Me grow up?

1290
01:10:25,621 --> 01:10:27,111
I'm not the one pretending to be a kid.

1291
01:10:27,189 --> 01:10:28,850
I'm not the one running away
from something.

1292
01:10:28,924 --> 01:10:30,482
You think my life is so easy.

1293
01:10:30,559 --> 01:10:31,821
You don't know anything about my life.

1294
01:10:31,894 --> 01:10:33,384
I used to be exactly like you.

1295
01:10:33,462 --> 01:10:34,451
Right, used to be.

1296
01:10:34,530 --> 01:10:35,963
Now you're the average,
middle-aged guy

1297
01:10:36,031 --> 01:10:39,262
running for senior class president,
seducing a girl half your age.

1298
01:10:39,335 --> 01:10:41,496
Yeah. And it's easy for you
to tell Billings to go eat shit.

1299
01:10:41,570 --> 01:10:43,299
The rest of us have
to worry about graduating.

1300
01:10:43,372 --> 01:10:45,397
By the way, I don't exactly
live to do your homework.

1301
01:10:45,474 --> 01:10:47,999
Okay, wait!
Let's get something straight here!

1302
01:10:48,077 --> 01:10:50,068
I am not middle-aged!

1303
01:10:50,145 --> 01:10:51,976
Fine! Let's get something else straight!

1304
01:10:52,047 --> 01:10:54,447
You're not the one who almost
killed their driving instructor

1305
01:10:54,516 --> 01:10:56,416
and then drove
a brand-new Dodge broadside

1306
01:10:56,485 --> 01:10:57,816
into a whole van full of nuns!

1307
01:10:57,886 --> 01:10:59,911
I did!

1308
01:11:01,323 --> 01:11:03,917
Nuns.

1309
01:11:03,993 --> 01:11:05,187
I'm sorry.

1310
01:11:05,327 --> 01:11:06,692
I'm sorry you failed your test.

1311
01:11:06,762 --> 01:11:10,163
I'm sorry about a lot of things.

1312
01:11:10,232 --> 01:11:11,927
God, I hated high school the first time.

1313
01:11:12,001 --> 01:11:14,231
Now I know why.

1314
01:11:14,303 --> 01:11:16,430
Well, at least we agree on something.

1315
01:11:16,505 --> 01:11:19,872
Let me give you a little advice
about your date tonight, okay?

1316
01:11:19,942 --> 01:11:22,137
Forget about Lessig.
Just have a good time.

1317
01:11:22,211 --> 01:11:24,509
What is she supposed to do,
ride on my handlebars?

1318
01:11:24,580 --> 01:11:26,571
- This is humiliating.
- Meet her at the movies, then.

1319
01:11:26,649 --> 01:11:29,311
- No, this is bad.
- Patrick!

1320
01:11:29,385 --> 01:11:30,750
All right, all right, I'm sorry.

1321
01:11:30,819 --> 01:11:32,184
Hey, what about you?
What's your problem?

1322
01:11:32,254 --> 01:11:34,745
Anything I can do?

1323
01:11:34,823 --> 01:11:38,020
Well, I'm almost 30,
and I'm still in high school.

1324
01:11:38,093 --> 01:11:40,323
And I hate it.

1325
01:11:40,396 --> 01:11:42,762
But I love Ryan.

1326
01:11:42,831 --> 01:11:45,766
And I want Kapados convicted,
but I don't wanna die.

1327
01:11:45,834 --> 01:11:48,325
Well, you're basically screwed.

1328
01:11:49,772 --> 01:11:51,399
Thanks.

1329
01:11:54,043 --> 01:11:57,979
Oh, and good luck tonight.

1330
01:11:58,047 --> 01:11:59,742
You, too.

1331
01:12:14,730 --> 01:12:16,595
Max?

1332
01:12:19,068 --> 01:12:21,593
Did you really lose
your parents in an accident?

1333
01:12:23,105 --> 01:12:25,130
I wouldn't make up something like that.

1334
01:12:27,276 --> 01:12:29,073
I didn't think you would.

1335
01:12:33,248 --> 01:12:36,183
Do you believe a person
has more than one life?

1336
01:12:36,251 --> 01:12:38,048
Reincarnation? I don't know.

1337
01:12:38,120 --> 01:12:39,985
I never really thought about it.

1338
01:12:41,457 --> 01:12:43,152
I wonder... I mean, if they're back,

1339
01:12:43,225 --> 01:12:45,489
where they'd be.

1340
01:12:45,561 --> 01:12:47,051
Your parents.

1341
01:12:49,798 --> 01:12:54,792
I bet someplace warm and peaceful.

1342
01:13:00,509 --> 01:13:02,272
It's really funny that you would say that

1343
01:13:02,344 --> 01:13:05,074
because when I was...

1344
01:13:05,147 --> 01:13:08,173
I guess I had to be about four,

1345
01:13:08,250 --> 01:13:10,844
they took me on a vacation.

1346
01:13:10,919 --> 01:13:13,410
And, there's a picture of me and them,

1347
01:13:13,489 --> 01:13:16,822
and it's really...
really one of the last things

1348
01:13:16,892 --> 01:13:20,487
I remember about
when they were alive.

1349
01:13:20,562 --> 01:13:24,430
They took me swimming
around the shore and...

1350
01:13:24,500 --> 01:13:26,331
there was all this coral and...

1351
01:13:35,677 --> 01:13:37,611
You're very beautiful.

1352
01:13:59,701 --> 01:14:02,192
What's the matter?

1353
01:14:07,109 --> 01:14:09,771
I keep wondering who you are,

1354
01:14:09,845 --> 01:14:11,312
why you don't give me
your phone number,

1355
01:14:11,380 --> 01:14:14,508
why you never show me where you live.

1356
01:14:14,583 --> 01:14:17,677
Max, where do you go when you go home?

1357
01:14:20,055 --> 01:14:22,683
Home.

1358
01:14:22,758 --> 01:14:24,783
Okay.

1359
01:14:24,860 --> 01:14:27,420
You wanna see where I live?

1360
01:14:27,496 --> 01:14:29,487
Come on. I'll show you.

1361
01:14:29,565 --> 01:14:30,759
Come on.

1362
01:14:47,483 --> 01:14:52,352
First, I stayed at Patrick's, then here.

1363
01:14:54,723 --> 01:14:56,816
- Max, you could have said something.
- No.

1364
01:14:58,227 --> 01:14:59,785
No, I couldn't.

1365
01:14:59,862 --> 01:15:03,298
The people that are after me want me dead.

1366
01:15:03,365 --> 01:15:08,667
I was afraid to tell you.
I was afraid I might put you in danger.

1367
01:15:08,737 --> 01:15:11,001
They're still out there looking.

1368
01:15:14,576 --> 01:15:18,376
Everything I said to you...

1369
01:15:18,447 --> 01:15:24,113
Everything Max said was from my heart.

1370
01:15:25,854 --> 01:15:27,253
Andrew's heart.

1371
01:15:32,528 --> 01:15:34,428
What are you gonna do?

1372
01:15:36,732 --> 01:15:39,030
I can't hide here forever.

1373
01:15:40,903 --> 01:15:43,064
My grades aren't that good.

1374
01:15:51,713 --> 01:15:53,476
Andrew.

1375
01:16:02,224 --> 01:16:04,419
Not just a car full of nuns,

1376
01:16:04,493 --> 01:16:07,326
a whole van full of nuns.

1377
01:16:07,396 --> 01:16:08,829
I mean, the sisters were pretty cool,

1378
01:16:08,897 --> 01:16:11,798
but Lessig is Satan.

1379
01:16:11,867 --> 01:16:12,834
Die, Lessig.

1380
01:16:12,901 --> 01:16:14,835
Eat shit and die!

1381
01:16:14,903 --> 01:16:15,961
That's not him.

1382
01:16:16,038 --> 01:16:17,232
That must be her other grandson.

1383
01:16:17,306 --> 01:16:19,604
- Shall we follow him?
- Yeah.

1384
01:16:19,675 --> 01:16:20,869
He could be going to see Morenski.

1385
01:16:20,943 --> 01:16:22,535
I'm going into town.

1386
01:16:34,790 --> 01:16:36,951
So you didn't want to see the ending.

1387
01:16:37,025 --> 01:16:39,220
I hated that movie.
It was disgusting.

1388
01:16:39,294 --> 01:16:40,989
I know.
That's what I liked about it.

1389
01:16:41,063 --> 01:16:44,123
I thought the decapitation
was totally realistic.

1390
01:16:44,199 --> 01:16:46,429
Please.

1391
01:16:46,501 --> 01:16:47,729
What now?

1392
01:16:47,803 --> 01:16:49,703
Food?

1393
01:16:49,771 --> 01:16:52,001
I can't believe you can eat after that.

1394
01:16:52,074 --> 01:16:53,769
Besides, I'm on a diet.

1395
01:16:53,842 --> 01:16:55,969
That explains the small Diet Coke

1396
01:16:56,044 --> 01:16:58,877
and the large Milk Duds.

1397
01:16:58,947 --> 01:17:00,437
Look...

1398
01:17:00,515 --> 01:17:02,779
you're not having a bad time, are you?

1399
01:17:04,720 --> 01:17:07,280
I know where we should go.

1400
01:17:07,356 --> 01:17:09,916
The train yard.

1401
01:17:09,992 --> 01:17:12,187
The train yard?
That's deserted.

1402
01:17:14,963 --> 01:17:16,828
Oh, the train yard.

1403
01:17:16,898 --> 01:17:18,331
That's deserted.

1404
01:17:20,002 --> 01:17:21,765
- Shit.
- What?

1405
01:17:23,171 --> 01:17:25,230
Look, I don't have my...

1406
01:17:25,307 --> 01:17:26,535
Alpha. It's in the shop.

1407
01:17:26,608 --> 01:17:28,075
I should never have bought
an Italian sports...

1408
01:17:28,143 --> 01:17:29,735
It's okay. We can take mine.

1409
01:17:29,811 --> 01:17:31,403
This is yours?

1410
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:32,970
My dad's.

1411
01:17:33,048 --> 01:17:34,379
He's in Hawaii till Sunday.

1412
01:17:35,751 --> 01:17:37,309
Bye-bye.

1413
01:17:37,386 --> 01:17:39,217
He just lets you borrow his jeep?

1414
01:17:39,287 --> 01:17:41,255
Not exactly.

1415
01:17:41,323 --> 01:17:43,917
Let's forget about the train yard.

1416
01:17:43,992 --> 01:17:45,220
Let's go to your house.

1417
01:17:46,662 --> 01:17:49,096
Fine with me, Patrick.

1418
01:17:49,164 --> 01:17:51,860
Here, you drive.

1419
01:17:51,933 --> 01:17:55,528
I failed Lessig's final, and I don't even
have a learner's permit.

1420
01:17:55,604 --> 01:17:58,004
That's a darn shame.

1421
01:18:09,551 --> 01:18:11,451
It looks like a stick.

1422
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:13,750
I think.

1423
01:18:13,822 --> 01:18:15,756
Where'd you get this sound system?

1424
01:18:17,092 --> 01:18:20,584
So, did you ever think
about wearing contacts?

1425
01:18:25,834 --> 01:18:28,928
My parents have a Jacuzzi.

1426
01:18:29,004 --> 01:18:30,369
How do you work the lights in this thing?

1427
01:18:30,439 --> 01:18:31,997
It's...

1428
01:18:33,308 --> 01:18:34,332
Sorry.

1429
01:18:55,464 --> 01:18:57,227
I can't see a thing,

1430
01:18:57,299 --> 01:18:59,790
and I put my glasses
down a second ago.

1431
01:18:59,868 --> 01:19:01,096
I can't...

1432
01:19:01,169 --> 01:19:02,864
Don't worry.
I'm doing fine, trust me.

1433
01:19:02,938 --> 01:19:05,168
Oh, no.

1434
01:19:05,240 --> 01:19:08,505
Two hands...
it's a waste of an entire hand.

1435
01:19:08,577 --> 01:19:12,035
I had no idea you were
such a confident driver.

1436
01:19:16,284 --> 01:19:18,411
You just can't see a thing, huh?

1437
01:19:18,487 --> 01:19:21,945
Well, everything past 3 inches
in front of my face is a total blur.

1438
01:19:23,358 --> 01:19:24,950
No kidding. A total blur?

1439
01:19:27,929 --> 01:19:29,191
Why are you stopping?

1440
01:19:30,766 --> 01:19:32,256
Patrick?

1441
01:19:40,142 --> 01:19:42,235
We're gonna do a little test.

1442
01:19:42,310 --> 01:19:44,676
You tell me when you can see me.

1443
01:20:00,662 --> 01:20:01,924
Hiya, chief.

1444
01:20:01,997 --> 01:20:03,692
I hear they're announcing
the winners tomorrow.

1445
01:20:03,765 --> 01:20:05,699
Yeah. Can I have a coffee,
please, extra black,

1446
01:20:05,767 --> 01:20:08,668
and a pack of Marlboros, hard box.

1447
01:20:08,737 --> 01:20:09,931
Doll, you look like crud.

1448
01:20:10,005 --> 01:20:12,371
Yeah, that's me, President Crud.

1449
01:20:14,209 --> 01:20:15,506
Kevin's in the back.

1450
01:20:15,577 --> 01:20:17,477
He don't look too happy.

1451
01:20:19,247 --> 01:20:21,078
Ma'am, when you have a chance.

1452
01:20:35,597 --> 01:20:38,395
Wow. That's a nice shot.

1453
01:20:38,466 --> 01:20:40,991
Hey, I wanna talk to you outside.

1454
01:20:41,069 --> 01:20:43,037
I'd like that.

1455
01:20:49,978 --> 01:20:52,412
You need to have
your whole entourage with you?

1456
01:20:54,649 --> 01:20:56,378
However you want it.

1457
01:21:02,624 --> 01:21:04,285
So what happened with the kid?

1458
01:21:04,359 --> 01:21:07,021
He's off with some bimbo.

1459
01:21:07,095 --> 01:21:09,563
My instincts are usually very solid.

1460
01:21:09,631 --> 01:21:11,861
Morenski's gotta be
in this town somewhere.

1461
01:21:20,842 --> 01:21:22,400
Here I am.

1462
01:21:23,712 --> 01:21:25,577
I'm sorry.

1463
01:21:25,647 --> 01:21:28,309
- What are you talking about?
- I'm sorry.

1464
01:21:28,383 --> 01:21:30,248
I didn't want anything
to do with your election.

1465
01:21:30,318 --> 01:21:31,717
Screw that election.

1466
01:21:31,786 --> 01:21:33,515
I'm talking about how you moved on Ryan.

1467
01:21:33,588 --> 01:21:35,818
I'm sorry about that, too, okay?

1468
01:21:35,891 --> 01:21:38,860
I'm not even gonna
be seeing her anymore.

1469
01:21:38,927 --> 01:21:40,861
I'm dropping out.

1470
01:21:40,929 --> 01:21:43,830
What are you talking about, Max?

1471
01:21:43,899 --> 01:21:45,298
Just call her, okay?

1472
01:21:45,367 --> 01:21:48,097
And when you do, don't treat her
like a piece of real estate.

1473
01:21:48,169 --> 01:21:49,397
Just listen to her.

1474
01:21:49,471 --> 01:21:51,268
- Hey, don't tell me what to do.
- Hands off.

1475
01:21:51,339 --> 01:21:52,499
Where you going, Max?

1476
01:21:52,574 --> 01:21:54,098
I wanna know what she said.

1477
01:21:54,175 --> 01:21:57,167
What'd she tell you about me, Max?

1478
01:21:57,245 --> 01:22:00,146
She said you were a pretty decent guy.

1479
01:22:00,215 --> 01:22:02,649
Good luck in the election tomorrow.

1480
01:22:02,717 --> 01:22:04,912
I hope to God you win.

1481
01:22:12,961 --> 01:22:14,656
Come on, let's go.

1482
01:22:14,729 --> 01:22:15,661
Yeah, sure.

1483
01:22:15,730 --> 01:22:17,322
Excuse me.

1484
01:22:17,399 --> 01:22:20,232
There was a young man sitting here.

1485
01:22:20,302 --> 01:22:23,135
- Maxwell?
- That's right. Maxwell.

1486
01:22:23,204 --> 01:22:24,762
Did you see where he went?

1487
01:22:24,839 --> 01:22:26,670
Honey, they come in and go out.

1488
01:22:26,741 --> 01:22:28,504
Couldn't have left more than
three or four minutes ago.

1489
01:22:28,576 --> 01:22:30,840
Got no idea which way he was headed?

1490
01:22:30,912 --> 01:22:31,879
Sorry, sweetie.

1491
01:22:31,947 --> 01:22:33,312
I serve them and off they go.

1492
01:22:33,381 --> 01:22:36,316
- See, look, I'm an old friend of his...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1493
01:22:41,656 --> 01:22:43,021
Stay here.

1494
01:23:33,742 --> 01:23:37,143
Would everybody kindly
take your seats, please?

1495
01:23:37,212 --> 01:23:39,544
Everybody sit down.

1496
01:23:39,614 --> 01:23:41,013
You people over there.

1497
01:23:41,082 --> 01:23:43,141
Sit down. Everybody down.

1498
01:23:48,523 --> 01:23:51,321
Everybody, down.
Come on, down.

1499
01:23:53,695 --> 01:23:56,061
How about a big round
of applause for the girls?

1500
01:23:57,065 --> 01:23:58,862
Mad Max for president!

1501
01:23:58,933 --> 01:24:00,924
Mad Max! Mad Max!

1502
01:24:01,002 --> 01:24:02,469
All right, can I have some quiet, please?

1503
01:24:02,537 --> 01:24:04,004
All right, my man Max!

1504
01:24:04,072 --> 01:24:06,597
Now, the order of the day.

1505
01:24:06,674 --> 01:24:10,303
It's time to announce
the new senior class officers.

1506
01:24:15,950 --> 01:24:18,316
All of your ballots have been cast,

1507
01:24:18,386 --> 01:24:20,752
and you've made your decisions.

1508
01:24:20,822 --> 01:24:23,916
Final tabulation's been made
by our Tellers Committee.

1509
01:24:23,992 --> 01:24:26,222
Could we have a big round
of applause for them?

1510
01:24:26,294 --> 01:24:29,525
Come on.

1511
01:24:35,236 --> 01:24:37,227
Treasurer.

1512
01:24:37,305 --> 01:24:40,274
Could I have the envelopes,
please, Mrs. Billing?

1513
01:24:47,248 --> 01:24:49,546
Thank you.

1514
01:24:49,617 --> 01:24:52,085
The winner is, for treasurer,

1515
01:24:52,153 --> 01:24:53,780
Victoria Bradley.

1516
01:24:59,394 --> 01:25:01,521
Congratulations, Victoria.

1517
01:25:03,765 --> 01:25:05,232
For vice-president.

1518
01:25:05,300 --> 01:25:08,701
Your new vice-president is Douglas Rowan.

1519
01:25:08,770 --> 01:25:10,897
How about it?

1520
01:25:16,377 --> 01:25:17,742
There's a lot of kids in there.

1521
01:25:17,812 --> 01:25:20,838
At the moment,
I'm only interested in one kid.

1522
01:25:20,915 --> 01:25:26,012
Finally, Topsail's
new senior class president.

1523
01:25:30,758 --> 01:25:32,919
Could we have some quiet, please?

1524
01:25:36,331 --> 01:25:38,265
It was a very, very close race,

1525
01:25:38,333 --> 01:25:41,268
but the winner is...

1526
01:25:41,336 --> 01:25:43,236
Kevin O'Roarke!

1527
01:25:47,175 --> 01:25:49,439
Say a few words, Kevin.

1528
01:25:49,511 --> 01:25:50,773
Congratulations.

1529
01:25:50,845 --> 01:25:53,245
Say a few words, Kevin.

1530
01:25:56,818 --> 01:25:59,412
Thank you.

1531
01:25:59,487 --> 01:26:01,785
As my first official action

1532
01:26:01,856 --> 01:26:04,416
as your new senior class president,

1533
01:26:04,492 --> 01:26:07,325
I think I'd like to demand a recount.

1534
01:26:07,395 --> 01:26:08,862
- What?
- A recount.

1535
01:26:08,930 --> 01:26:11,558
Wait a minute.
You can't do that.

1536
01:26:11,633 --> 01:26:14,466
As a matter of fact,
I think we can do it right now.

1537
01:26:14,536 --> 01:26:16,868
Everyone here who voted for me,

1538
01:26:16,938 --> 01:26:19,668
could you just raise your hand, please?

1539
01:26:20,842 --> 01:26:21,831
Thanks.

1540
01:26:21,910 --> 01:26:24,401
And now, how many for Max?

1541
01:26:34,689 --> 01:26:36,782
Come on up here, Max.

1542
01:26:46,935 --> 01:26:49,335
Andrew! Andrew!

1543
01:26:51,072 --> 01:26:53,199
Come on up here.

1544
01:26:56,144 --> 01:26:57,372
Here's your real president.

1545
01:27:02,917 --> 01:27:05,351
Andrew!

1546
01:27:05,420 --> 01:27:07,320
Please.

1547
01:27:07,388 --> 01:27:09,913
Please. I'm not the person you think...

1548
01:27:14,662 --> 01:27:15,594
Get down!

1549
01:27:15,663 --> 01:27:17,824
Down! Everybody, get down!

1550
01:27:17,899 --> 01:27:19,867
Get down!

1551
01:27:44,392 --> 01:27:46,553
I thought I was the only one
who wanted to kill you.

1552
01:27:46,628 --> 01:27:48,152
Take a number.

1553
01:28:36,511 --> 01:28:38,035
Easy, Max.

1554
01:28:47,288 --> 01:28:48,915
Andrew, you're pushing it.

1555
01:28:50,725 --> 01:28:53,285
You know, you're a piss-poor hit man.

1556
01:29:12,680 --> 01:29:15,581
You seem a little nervous.

1557
01:29:15,650 --> 01:29:19,313
What kind of a sniper is afraid of heights?

1558
01:29:21,756 --> 01:29:23,781
What's your name?
You know my name. What's yours?

1559
01:29:29,497 --> 01:29:32,091
How much is Kapados paying you, anyway?

1560
01:29:33,968 --> 01:29:37,927
You know what Freud says
about people who play with guns?

1561
01:29:38,005 --> 01:29:40,599
They have little dicks.

1562
01:30:12,173 --> 01:30:13,970
Oh, my God!

1563
01:30:34,929 --> 01:30:36,829
State your name for the court.

1564
01:30:36,898 --> 01:30:38,388
Andrew Morenski.

1565
01:30:38,466 --> 01:30:39,728
And do you, Andrew Morenski,

1566
01:30:39,801 --> 01:30:41,325
swear to tell the truth, the whole truth,

1567
01:30:41,402 --> 01:30:42,494
and nothing but the truth,

1568
01:30:42,570 --> 01:30:44,003
so help you God?

1569
01:30:44,071 --> 01:30:45,663
I do.

1570
01:30:53,047 --> 01:30:56,380
Mr. Breech, your witness.

1571
01:30:56,451 --> 01:30:58,646
Thank you, Your Honor.

1572
01:30:58,719 --> 01:31:02,712
Mr. Morenski,
how well do you recall the first time

1573
01:31:02,790 --> 01:31:05,418
you met the defendant,
Mr. Victor Kapados?

1574
01:31:06,861 --> 01:31:08,226
Very well.

1575
01:31:09,764 --> 01:31:12,562
In your own words,
would you describe for the court

1576
01:31:12,633 --> 01:31:14,999
the circumstances of that meeting?

1577
01:31:19,140 --> 01:31:23,839
Mr. Ahern, Mr. Rodriguez,

1578
01:31:23,911 --> 01:31:26,072
and I were at our offices.

1579
01:31:26,147 --> 01:31:28,240
I believe it was in...

1580
01:31:30,017 --> 01:31:31,245
Andrew.

1581
01:31:33,321 --> 01:31:35,312
Make it short.
You have a plane to catch.

1582
01:31:35,389 --> 01:31:37,289
I'll wait over here, Andrew.

1583
01:31:43,965 --> 01:31:46,798
I have to go away
for a little while, Grammy.

1584
01:31:46,868 --> 01:31:49,132
They wouldn't tell me where.

1585
01:31:49,203 --> 01:31:50,568
Yeah, I know.
That's...

1586
01:31:50,638 --> 01:31:51,935
That's one of the rules.

1587
01:31:52,006 --> 01:31:55,032
Well, it's a bad rule.
I'm your grandmother.

1588
01:31:55,109 --> 01:31:57,441
I can't tell you where.

1589
01:31:57,512 --> 01:32:00,811
But they let me have a little
bit of a say in the decision, so...

1590
01:32:00,882 --> 01:32:03,316
so I'll be fine.

1591
01:32:03,384 --> 01:32:06,012
No more trading stocks.

1592
01:32:06,087 --> 01:32:07,679
No.

1593
01:32:07,755 --> 01:32:09,518
No, but...

1594
01:32:12,226 --> 01:32:15,889
But that may not be such a terrible thing.

1595
01:32:18,366 --> 01:32:22,496
Your parents would be so proud.

1596
01:32:22,570 --> 01:32:24,538
And you already know how I feel.

1597
01:32:32,046 --> 01:32:34,879
Bye, Honey Boy.

1598
01:32:34,949 --> 01:32:36,041
Be good.

1599
01:32:54,669 --> 01:32:56,569
Yo! Patrick!

1600
01:32:56,637 --> 01:32:58,832
Hey, guys!
This is my new set of wheels!

1601
01:32:58,906 --> 01:33:01,101
Patrick, my man!
Get in here!

1602
01:33:01,175 --> 01:33:02,938
Yo, that's a loud ride!

1603
01:33:03,010 --> 01:33:06,207
Check that out!

1604
01:33:06,280 --> 01:33:08,680
All right, all right.
It's picture time. Let's go.

1605
01:33:08,749 --> 01:33:10,114
On three.
One, two, three.

1606
01:33:10,184 --> 01:33:11,378
Bust a move.

1607
01:34:00,901 --> 01:34:02,630
Hi.

1608
01:34:03,638 --> 01:34:05,833
I'm getting my teaching degree.

1609
01:34:05,906 --> 01:34:07,771
My S.A.T. scores were not very good,

1610
01:34:07,842 --> 01:34:10,504
but I had a few friends
in the Justice Department.

1611
01:34:12,346 --> 01:34:14,712
You know, this is a little strange.

1612
01:34:14,782 --> 01:34:17,808
A little strange?
It's a lot strange.

1613
01:34:17,885 --> 01:34:20,046
Yeah, well, I've been here a while,

1614
01:34:20,121 --> 01:34:22,783
trying to figure out how to talk to you.

1615
01:34:24,158 --> 01:34:26,592
So, are you still seeing that...

1616
01:34:26,661 --> 01:34:28,424
- Kevin?
- Yeah.

1617
01:34:28,496 --> 01:34:30,555
No, that was high school.

1618
01:34:32,466 --> 01:34:34,400
I followed the trial.

1619
01:34:34,468 --> 01:34:37,301
I'm really glad you're okay, Max.

1620
01:34:37,371 --> 01:34:38,360
Andrew.

1621
01:34:38,439 --> 01:34:39,906
Oh, wait.

1622
01:34:39,974 --> 01:34:41,498
You stay right there.

1623
01:34:47,815 --> 01:34:48,839
Let's start all over again.

1624
01:34:48,916 --> 01:34:51,043
Hi. I'm Eddie Collins.

1625
01:34:51,118 --> 01:34:52,881
Nice to meet you.
I'm new here.

1626
01:34:52,953 --> 01:34:54,921
May I? Thanks.

1627
01:34:56,023 --> 01:34:57,115
Eddie Collins?

1628
01:34:57,191 --> 01:34:58,488
It's just a name.

1629
01:34:58,559 --> 01:35:01,357
Is that the best you could come up with?

1630
01:35:01,429 --> 01:35:02,828
It sounds so fake.

1631
01:35:04,365 --> 01:35:05,354
It is.

1632
01:35:31,792 --> 01:35:35,694
So, Eddie, how do you like college?

1633
01:35:37,565 --> 01:35:40,466
You know...

1634
01:35:40,534 --> 01:35:42,934
it's much better the second time.

1635
01:39:11,378 --> 01:39:14,370
