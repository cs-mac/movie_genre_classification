<i>A JUNG ./[WOO FILM PRODUCTION</i>

00:00:37,902 --> 00:00:40,690

5
00:02:55,206 --> 00:02:57,698
I have never seen a moon so beautiful.

6
00:02:58,209 --> 00:03:00,701
I believe she was watching the same moon.

7
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:03,370
But to her

8
00:03:04,215 --> 00:03:06,752
The moon wouldn't have looked so beautiful.

9
00:03:07,552 --> 00:03:13,047
Every person sees a different vision
of a same object.

10
00:04:21,084 --> 00:04:22,074
Who are you?

11
00:04:26,798 --> 00:04:27,663
Who are you?

12
00:04:28,883 --> 00:04:29,964
I'm Eungyo.

13
00:04:30,385 --> 00:04:32,171
How did you get in here?

14
00:04:38,685 --> 00:04:42,679
There's a ladder by the fence.

15
00:04:48,861 --> 00:04:50,852
I've always wanted to
sit in a chair like this.

16
00:04:54,283 --> 00:04:55,990
Does it belong to you?

17
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:59,862
You came down from the woods?

18
00:05:00,665 --> 00:05:01,871
Where do you live?

19
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:04,365
Next to the laundromat.

20
00:05:08,881 --> 00:05:10,087
I'll get going now.

21
00:05:11,009 --> 00:05:12,295
Goodbye.

22
00:05:54,052 --> 00:05:57,761
The term 'National Poet' sounds crude.

23
00:05:58,765 --> 00:06:05,057
It is such a blessing to be able to
learn from such a great teacher.

24
00:06:05,688 --> 00:06:11,058
I don't think age matters
once you're past 20.

25
00:06:11,778 --> 00:06:14,395
I'm too old to be called a prodigy.

26
00:06:16,699 --> 00:06:23,571
In my case,
I think I'm just the right age

27
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:27,578
To present Heart to the world with confidence.

28
00:06:30,254 --> 00:06:33,372
I will try harder in the future

29
00:06:33,674 --> 00:06:35,665
And there will be much suffering involved.

30
00:06:56,114 --> 00:06:57,104
Too salty?

31
00:07:45,997 --> 00:07:53,290
Now you can write your own stories.

32
00:07:53,796 --> 00:08:09,679
The Heart is topping charts everywhere!

33
00:08:16,777 --> 00:08:21,362
By the way,
I've been commissioned a story.

34
00:08:22,366 --> 00:08:23,356
What?

35
00:08:25,494 --> 00:08:40,251
I've been commissioned a story.
I would like to concentrate on that, so...

36
00:08:46,057 --> 00:08:50,676
Remember the girl who was sleeping on your porch?

37
00:08:53,564 --> 00:08:55,475
I gave her a ride
from her school by chance

38
00:08:56,984 --> 00:09:00,067
And she was looking for a part-time job.

39
00:09:01,072 --> 00:09:02,904
Isn't she in high school?

40
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:07,405
She said that she does
all the housework at home.

41
00:09:08,412 --> 00:09:12,747
Tell her to come this Saturday afternoon.

42
00:09:58,963 --> 00:10:00,374
Hello.

43
00:11:01,359 --> 00:11:02,190
Sorry!

44
00:11:02,276 --> 00:11:03,687
It's okay.

45
00:11:34,392 --> 00:11:34,972
Let me do it.

46
00:11:35,059 --> 00:11:37,471
- No, it's fine. I'll do it.
- No, I'll do it.

47
00:11:58,416 --> 00:11:59,577
Don't worry.

48
00:12:12,179 --> 00:12:13,590
Be careful.

49
00:12:35,953 --> 00:12:36,943
Bummer!

50
00:12:38,581 --> 00:12:39,787
What does 'bummer' mean?

51
00:12:39,957 --> 00:12:45,168
Uh, it means thank you very much.

52
00:12:57,099 --> 00:12:57,804
And your name is...

53
00:12:57,892 --> 00:12:59,178
It's Seo Eunpa.

54
00:12:59,477 --> 00:13:06,270
- Thank you, Eunpa.
- Now can I get a hug?

55
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:10,355
Of course.

56
00:13:10,488 --> 00:13:11,273
Thank you very much.

57
00:13:54,365 --> 00:13:59,360
When I clean the top window,
my fingers go wriggly.

58
00:14:00,204 --> 00:14:02,070
Reminds me of dance lessons...

59
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:07,079
I use to take dance classes
until 7th grade.

60
00:14:16,762 --> 00:14:18,878
Can you tighten it some more?

61
00:14:19,056 --> 00:14:20,763
How are you going to breathe?

62
00:14:21,892 --> 00:14:27,058
And the skirt?
This short?

63
00:14:31,277 --> 00:14:32,267
Shorter.

64
00:14:32,403 --> 00:14:38,775
They'll be able to see your panties!
All right, this much...

65
00:14:53,674 --> 00:14:57,383
Grumpa, Your pencils are all stumpy.

66
00:14:59,471 --> 00:15:01,257
Would you like me to sharpen them?

67
00:15:03,183 --> 00:15:04,173
Let them be.

68
00:15:05,894 --> 00:15:07,976
Sharp pencils are woeful.

69
00:15:08,272 --> 00:15:11,185
What's so woeful about them?

70
00:15:13,402 --> 00:15:14,688
What do you think?

71
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:30,454
Grumpa.

72
00:15:32,379 --> 00:15:37,670
If pencils are sad
because they're sharp...

73
00:15:40,387 --> 00:15:42,879
Does that mean
all sharp pencils are sad?

74
00:15:45,309 --> 00:15:46,299
Is that...

75
00:15:47,811 --> 00:15:48,892
poetry?

76
00:15:55,653 --> 00:16:01,148
Images one derives from an object...

77
00:16:02,785 --> 00:16:05,277
Is often as far apart as heaven and hell.

78
00:16:06,664 --> 00:16:08,371
When I think of pencils

79
00:16:10,292 --> 00:16:13,080
I see a boy running to school.

80
00:16:15,381 --> 00:16:27,476
He loved the sound of his pencil case
rattling inside his school bag.

81
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:39,691
When the boy couldn't afford
to go to school any more

82
00:16:41,699 --> 00:16:46,990
The rattling sounded
as if the pencils were crying.

83
00:16:47,996 --> 00:16:52,706
So to me,
the pencils means tears.

84
00:16:55,003 --> 00:17:00,248
When you say
'Grumpa, please sharpen my pencil'

85
00:17:02,261 --> 00:17:05,253
I hear this instead.

86
00:17:07,683 --> 00:17:14,271
'Grumpa, please wipe away my tears.'

87
00:18:11,163 --> 00:18:12,449
<i>Grumpa ?</i>

88
00:18:13,373 --> 00:18:15,284
<i>It's me, Eungyo.</i>

89
00:18:17,586 --> 00:18:18,872
<i>Grumpa.</i>

90
00:18:29,973 --> 00:18:32,089
What are you doing here
at this time of night?

91
00:18:32,309 --> 00:18:38,396
Can't you see I'm wet?
Scolding me first...

92
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:57,664
Grumpa

93
00:19:00,879 --> 00:19:02,165
Can I stay the night?

94
00:19:05,801 --> 00:19:06,586
What?

95
00:19:09,012 --> 00:19:14,553
Please let me stay.
I can't go home tonight.

96
00:19:20,065 --> 00:19:21,271
Let me see your face.

97
00:19:26,697 --> 00:19:28,062
Let me see your face.

98
00:19:34,288 --> 00:19:35,870
Someone has slapped you.

99
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:39,285
Who is it?

100
00:19:41,003 --> 00:19:42,493
Is it someone you know?

101
00:19:43,505 --> 00:19:44,495
My mom.

102
00:19:45,549 --> 00:19:47,961
Your mother?

103
00:19:48,468 --> 00:19:55,886
<i>She does that sometimes.
But only to me...</i>

104
00:19:56,894 --> 00:20:02,685
I usually go to my friend's house
when something like this happens.

105
00:20:04,192 --> 00:20:06,183
Let's get you changed first.

106
00:20:07,404 --> 00:20:08,485
Follow me.

107
00:21:17,307 --> 00:21:18,593
Grumpa.

108
00:21:20,394 --> 00:21:22,180
Can I tell you something?

109
00:21:23,814 --> 00:21:25,646
I'll take you home
when the rain stops.

110
00:21:27,651 --> 00:21:29,642
Can I tell you something?

111
00:21:34,157 --> 00:21:35,067
Can I?

112
00:21:37,995 --> 00:21:38,860
What?

113
00:21:40,163 --> 00:21:42,575
I said, can I tell you something?

114
00:21:44,084 --> 00:21:44,994
Yes.

115
00:21:45,669 --> 00:21:47,080
I remembered.

116
00:21:48,005 --> 00:21:50,292
Your poem in the textbook.

117
00:21:52,384 --> 00:21:53,670
'Camellia ', right?

118
00:22:00,267 --> 00:22:03,180
A little bird by the camellia grave.

119
00:22:05,564 --> 00:22:08,056
A sad bird with red beaks.

120
00:22:10,068 --> 00:22:14,562
A little bird who left crimson tear marks.

121
00:22:16,783 --> 00:22:18,990
It was in my last exam.

122
00:22:31,089 --> 00:22:32,250
By the way...

123
00:22:34,551 --> 00:22:35,757
For me...

124
00:22:37,554 --> 00:22:41,548
Pencils remind me of mom.

125
00:22:44,061 --> 00:22:45,392
When I was young,

126
00:22:46,563 --> 00:22:56,405
She used to shave her heels
with my pencil knife.

127
00:22:57,282 --> 00:22:58,568
Crouching...

128
00:23:00,577 --> 00:23:06,072
She doesn't do it any more
Now that she works in a public bathhouse...

129
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:09,241
Now it's running sore

130
00:23:11,379 --> 00:23:13,165
So you have to use a dryer.

131
00:23:14,466 --> 00:23:17,174
I don't know what's worse.

132
00:23:18,261 --> 00:23:23,256
That's why I think
the pencil sharpener is sad.

133
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:28,977
Or is it the heel sad?

134
00:23:33,276 --> 00:23:34,983
That's poetry.

135
00:23:40,867 --> 00:23:42,278
Sad pencil...

136
00:23:44,663 --> 00:23:46,654
Sad heel...

137
00:23:59,803 --> 00:24:00,884
Grumpa!

138
00:24:00,887 --> 00:24:01,968
What do you think about my feet?

139
00:24:05,392 --> 00:24:06,598
Bummer!

140
00:24:06,685 --> 00:24:07,595
Bummer?

141
00:24:09,479 --> 00:24:11,766
You are thanking me
For dropping your blouse?

142
00:27:21,087 --> 00:27:22,373
<i>Grumpa...</i>

143
00:27:23,673 --> 00:27:24,879
Let's have breakfast.

144
00:28:05,465 --> 00:28:06,546
Hello.

145
00:28:08,885 --> 00:28:11,968
What are you wearing?

146
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:16,890
It's Grumpa's. .
Very comfortable.

147
00:28:21,064 --> 00:28:21,974
Where is he?

148
00:28:25,777 --> 00:28:26,687
I don't know.

149
00:28:27,695 --> 00:28:28,981
Is he in the study?

150
00:28:34,285 --> 00:28:38,404
Grumpa! Did you sleep well?

151
00:29:07,694 --> 00:29:08,900
He doesn't eat bread.

152
00:29:10,405 --> 00:29:11,861
I said he doesn't eat bread.

153
00:29:13,366 --> 00:29:15,073
There is some in the freezer.

154
00:29:15,285 --> 00:29:16,446
It's mine.

155
00:29:18,371 --> 00:29:20,863
I think he'll want to eat it.

156
00:29:20,957 --> 00:29:21,947
What do you know?

157
00:29:23,376 --> 00:29:25,959
Then you think
you know him that well?

158
00:29:26,087 --> 00:29:26,952
Of course.

159
00:29:29,966 --> 00:29:30,956
Really?

160
00:29:36,306 --> 00:29:37,592
Grumpa.

161
00:29:42,604 --> 00:29:45,847
Ta-da!
Home-made club sandwich.

162
00:29:46,065 --> 00:29:47,146
Looks good, doesn't it?

163
00:29:53,072 --> 00:29:58,283
Stuff in the refrigerator
turned into work of art.

164
00:29:59,787 --> 00:30:01,073
Try it.

165
00:30:01,164 --> 00:30:02,154
Yes.

166
00:30:03,166 --> 00:30:06,284
Sir, you don't eat bread.

167
00:30:08,796 --> 00:30:12,585
This isn't bread.
It's a sandwich.

168
00:30:14,886 --> 00:30:16,376
I'll bring some coffee.

169
00:30:31,861 --> 00:30:36,856
Sir, she's a high school girl.

170
00:30:40,078 --> 00:30:41,284
Yes she is.

171
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:45,698
What's wrong with that?

172
00:30:53,258 --> 00:30:54,168
What?

173
00:30:55,051 --> 00:30:56,257
No, nothing...

174
00:30:57,971 --> 00:30:59,678
The roll of thunder was deafening.

175
00:30:59,764 --> 00:31:01,755
How could you be so calm?

176
00:31:02,392 --> 00:31:04,053
I was scared to death.

177
00:31:04,185 --> 00:31:08,895
You must have a lot on your conscience.

178
00:31:09,566 --> 00:31:12,479
That's why I was hiding in.

179
00:31:13,069 --> 00:31:16,983
I found you near my waist in the morning.

180
00:31:17,991 --> 00:31:19,982
Not much of a place to hide...

181
00:31:22,787 --> 00:31:28,248
By the way,
I saw the tattoo below your neck.

182
00:31:29,252 --> 00:31:30,083
Fascinating.

183
00:31:30,169 --> 00:31:32,456
You mean the henna?

184
00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:35,672
It's not a tattoo?

185
00:31:36,259 --> 00:31:38,591
It rubs off after a few days...

186
00:31:52,191 --> 00:31:53,898
You can stop coming to his house now.

187
00:31:54,485 --> 00:31:55,190
Why?

188
00:31:55,695 --> 00:31:57,902
I won't be paying you any more.

189
00:31:58,197 --> 00:32:01,155
That's strange.
He asked me come twice a week.

190
00:32:01,951 --> 00:32:02,361
What?

191
00:32:02,452 --> 00:32:05,570
He gave me the key to the front gate
because the ladder's too dangerous.

192
00:32:28,102 --> 00:32:28,807
Hey!

193
00:32:32,774 --> 00:32:33,980
My mirror!

194
00:32:34,984 --> 00:32:37,567
Clumsy girl.
Why do you need a mirror in the woods?

195
00:32:37,654 --> 00:32:39,645
It's an Anna Sui princess mirror!

196
00:32:43,368 --> 00:32:46,156
Anna Sui? What's that?
I'll buy you a new one just like it.

197
00:32:46,663 --> 00:32:48,995
Mom gave it to me on my birthday.

198
00:32:51,084 --> 00:32:53,291
I'll buy you one.
I'll buy you the same one.

199
00:32:53,378 --> 00:32:55,494
It's not the same!

200
00:32:55,797 --> 00:32:56,878
What the...

201
00:32:57,882 --> 00:32:59,372
It may look the same to you
But to me,

202
00:32:59,509 --> 00:33:02,297
It's as different as heaven and hell.

203
00:33:03,012 --> 00:33:05,049
It was her first birthday present to me!

204
00:33:05,181 --> 00:33:08,549
The same one isn't the same!

205
00:33:08,851 --> 00:33:11,843
What are you talking about?
Why shouldn't it be same?

206
00:33:21,197 --> 00:33:22,062
Sir?

207
00:33:23,199 --> 00:33:25,782
Sir!

208
00:33:28,496 --> 00:33:29,702
<i>Sir; be careful!</i>

209
00:33:30,289 --> 00:33:31,370
<i>Watch your feet!</i>

210
00:33:31,499 --> 00:33:32,989
<i>Under your foot! Right there!</i>

211
00:33:34,210 --> 00:33:36,201
- Do something!
- Slowly... slowly...!

212
00:33:44,679 --> 00:33:46,169
<i>Right there! Under your foot!
Be careful!</i>

213
00:33:46,264 --> 00:33:47,550
<i>That's it; sir!</i>

214
00:33:57,191 --> 00:34:00,559
<i>Sir; put the mirror in your pocket.</i>

215
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:04,067
<i>In your pocket! Your pocket, sir!</i>

216
00:34:15,752 --> 00:34:16,662
Sir!

217
00:34:18,087 --> 00:34:18,747
Slowly, slowly...

218
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,462
Take my hand, sir.

219
00:34:35,104 --> 00:34:35,969
Here you go.

220
00:34:36,606 --> 00:34:39,769
Your mother gave it to you..
It must be precious.

221
00:34:45,448 --> 00:34:47,155
Why did you do that?
You could have been hurt!

222
00:35:02,381 --> 00:35:03,667
<i>Grumpa.</i>

223
00:35:05,384 --> 00:35:06,874
<i>Grumpa!</i>

224
00:35:10,181 --> 00:35:13,890
Remember what you've asked me before?

225
00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:15,175
What?

226
00:35:15,394 --> 00:35:17,806
About the henna on my chest.

227
00:35:17,897 --> 00:35:19,058
Uh, yes.

228
00:35:19,065 --> 00:35:23,480
I knew then that you want to try it.

229
00:35:24,570 --> 00:35:26,982
No, no.

230
00:35:27,073 --> 00:35:30,361
You don't mean what you say!

231
00:35:30,493 --> 00:35:35,158
You are curious about teenagers' activities,
As I am about grown-ups'.

232
00:35:35,289 --> 00:35:38,281
- I really don't want to.
- Come on.

233
00:35:38,501 --> 00:35:39,491
Lie down.

234
00:35:56,853 --> 00:35:58,343
Rest your head on my leg.

235
00:35:58,563 --> 00:35:59,769
Your leg?

236
00:36:01,065 --> 00:36:02,681
How else would I draw?

237
00:36:20,293 --> 00:36:24,582
Unbutton your shirt. One...

238
00:36:25,006 --> 00:36:28,249
Two, three.

239
00:36:52,074 --> 00:36:56,284
Grumpa. Your chest is really smooth.

240
00:36:57,788 --> 00:36:58,744
Is it?

241
00:37:10,968 --> 00:37:15,963
Stop moving.
I can't draw properly.

242
00:37:22,396 --> 00:37:23,682
Close your eyes.

243
00:37:25,274 --> 00:37:26,184
All right.

244
00:37:31,864 --> 00:37:35,357
I guess grown ups are ticklish as well.

245
00:37:36,285 --> 00:37:38,447
I have ticklish ankles.

246
00:37:39,789 --> 00:37:43,453
Just below the ankle.
You know the shallow part.

247
00:39:33,903 --> 00:39:34,984
<i>Don't...</i>

248
00:39:35,988 --> 00:39:37,069
<i>Don't...</i>

249
00:41:15,296 --> 00:41:19,164
<i>I could easily wrap my fingers
around Eungyo's ankle</i>

250
00:41:20,593 --> 00:41:24,678
<i>Her heel slipped between my fingers</i>

251
00:41:25,681 --> 00:41:33,771
<i>And she giggled.</i>

252
00:41:47,995 --> 00:41:53,866
<i>Her fragrant head rested be/ow my chin</i>

253
00:41:55,002 --> 00:41:59,542
<i>And my lips were already buried
in her hair.</i>

254
00:42:01,175 --> 00:42:07,888
<i>She sighed like a pair of bellows.</i>

255
00:42:50,266 --> 00:42:53,975
<i>Grumpa, you can open your eyes now.</i>

256
00:43:11,662 --> 00:43:16,953
Look. It's the same one as mine.

257
00:43:19,086 --> 00:43:22,295
So it is.

258
00:44:23,859 --> 00:44:26,351
<i>I held you close in my arms.</i>

259
00:44:27,071 --> 00:44:32,692
<i>I caressed your hair;
your shoulders, your waist</i>

260
00:44:33,202 --> 00:44:37,571
<i>And I put my ear to your chest
listening to your heart beating.</i>

261
00:44:38,791 --> 00:44:45,379
<i>You were so heartbreakingly beautiful.</i>

262
00:45:34,888 --> 00:45:40,884
<i>Can you do me a favor; Eungyo?</i>

263
00:45:43,605 --> 00:45:45,687
<i>No, I think I have the flu.</i>

264
00:45:46,483 --> 00:45:53,071
<i>Can you bring me some medicine?
Just some aspirin.</i>

265
00:45:53,866 --> 00:45:55,152
Hello?

266
00:46:08,088 --> 00:46:09,453
Anybody here?

267
00:46:22,394 --> 00:46:24,476
How is your flu?

268
00:46:30,486 --> 00:46:31,476
You!

269
00:46:33,864 --> 00:46:35,650
What are you doing to him?

270
00:46:35,782 --> 00:46:36,362
What?

271
00:46:36,492 --> 00:46:39,780
He isn't who you think he is, okay?

272
00:46:40,078 --> 00:46:41,489
He's a noble person!

273
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:44,072
How do you know
what he means to me?

274
00:46:45,292 --> 00:46:48,080
What are you saying?
What did I do?

275
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:51,579
How do you know
what he means to me?

276
00:46:54,593 --> 00:46:56,800
Jerk off, you motherfucker.

277
00:46:57,095 --> 00:47:01,339
What did you say?
Jerk off?

278
00:47:01,683 --> 00:47:02,764
Did you call me motherfucker?

279
00:47:02,851 --> 00:47:03,841
What did you call me?

280
00:47:03,977 --> 00:47:05,183
I could just...

281
00:47:09,483 --> 00:47:11,269
You are putting him in danger.

282
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:12,771
In danger?!

283
00:47:14,363 --> 00:47:17,071
If you hadn't messed around
with that mirror,

284
00:47:17,199 --> 00:47:18,280
Yes, the mirror!

285
00:47:18,492 --> 00:47:20,984
If you hadn't cried over that mirror
He wouldn't have risked his life.

286
00:47:21,078 --> 00:47:22,864
You were the reason I dropped it!

287
00:47:23,372 --> 00:47:31,086
What's so special about that mirror?
It's just one of thousands from a factory.

288
00:47:31,213 --> 00:47:34,672
You can buy the same one over and over.
What's all the fuss about?

289
00:47:34,758 --> 00:47:37,170
I told you it was
a birthday present from Mom!

290
00:47:37,678 --> 00:47:38,258
So what?!

291
00:47:38,387 --> 00:47:42,176
You think it's filled with
her love or something?

292
00:48:02,995 --> 00:48:03,700
Here.

293
00:48:22,389 --> 00:48:25,882
I'd forgotten you were an engineering major.

294
00:48:27,185 --> 00:48:28,266
Engineering major?

295
00:48:28,395 --> 00:48:31,683
He told me about the first time you two met.

296
00:48:33,984 --> 00:48:34,974
What did he say?

297
00:48:36,278 --> 00:48:41,569
It took you 10 years to realize
that all stars aren't the same.

298
00:48:44,161 --> 00:48:47,279
<i>What do you think 'that' means here?</i>

299
00:48:49,082 --> 00:48:49,867
Yes?

300
00:48:57,799 --> 00:48:58,664
A star.

301
00:49:01,678 --> 00:49:07,674
This is the best example which illustrates
modernity and self-sufficiency of modern poetry.

302
00:49:09,394 --> 00:49:14,139
<i>It's meaningful that this poem
emphasizes originality especially .</i>

303
00:49:17,986 --> 00:49:18,976
Sir.

304
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:23,648
Comparing something as beautiful as a star

305
00:49:24,493 --> 00:49:29,579
to a goose feed or prison wall

306
00:49:30,499 --> 00:49:32,661
is considered poetic sentiment?

307
00:49:35,504 --> 00:49:39,168
Do I know you?
I don't believe we've met.

308
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:44,885
My name is Seo Jiwoo.
Sophomore, department of inorganic engineering.

309
00:49:46,556 --> 00:49:50,845
I don't know who told you
that stars are beautiful.

310
00:49:52,688 --> 00:50:00,482
Stars aren't beautiful or ugly.
Stars are just stars.

311
00:50:00,779 --> 00:50:08,277
To lovers, stars may look beautiful
But to a hungry person

312
00:50:08,787 --> 00:50:11,779
It may look like a tasty snack.

313
00:50:13,208 --> 00:50:19,454
If you are in inorganic industry,
The star may seem full of pesticide.

314
00:50:20,674 --> 00:50:21,880
<i>Sir...</i>

315
00:50:24,261 --> 00:50:27,674
Inorganic means materials
like ceramics and minerals.

316
00:50:27,764 --> 00:50:29,380
Not inorganic food.

317
00:50:36,481 --> 00:50:37,892
<i>What else he tell you?</i>

318
00:50:41,278 --> 00:50:43,565
About the time he went to prison.

319
00:50:44,906 --> 00:50:47,898
How he learned to fix cars in there.

320
00:50:48,702 --> 00:50:53,367
He can take a car apart
And put it together again.

321
00:50:55,250 --> 00:50:57,457
What did he tell you about me?

322
00:51:01,965 --> 00:51:03,080
I don't know.

323
00:51:04,885 --> 00:51:07,468
Is there something I shouldn't hear?

324
00:51:12,684 --> 00:51:15,597
Or something you want me to hear?

325
00:51:23,195 --> 00:51:24,685
So this is The Heart.

326
00:51:29,284 --> 00:51:32,447
I want to read it.
Can I borrow it?

327
00:51:57,395 --> 00:52:00,854
Hey, did you... read it?

328
00:52:01,274 --> 00:52:02,139
What?

329
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:04,646
I mean The Heart.

330
00:52:05,278 --> 00:52:07,645
Your novel?

331
00:52:08,990 --> 00:52:11,982
No, I've been busy with mid-term exams.

332
00:52:16,081 --> 00:52:21,372
Don't read it if you haven't started yet.
It's just a vulgar commercial novel.

333
00:52:28,510 --> 00:52:33,550
Hey, hey!
What do you think you're doing?

334
00:52:33,765 --> 00:52:35,255
What's the fuss?

335
00:52:35,475 --> 00:52:39,264
He puts his writings in here.
It's too far.

336
00:52:40,188 --> 00:52:43,271
You've seen him writing?

337
00:52:44,860 --> 00:52:48,273
It's hard for him to go back and forth.
This is the perfect spot.

338
00:52:50,365 --> 00:52:51,275
No, don't, don't!

339
00:52:51,366 --> 00:52:53,573
He hates it when things are out of place.
He doesn't like changes.

340
00:52:56,872 --> 00:52:59,489
What's the use of wasting this pretty chest?

341
00:52:59,583 --> 00:53:03,577
It's been there since before you were born.
It's older than you!

342
00:53:06,965 --> 00:53:11,050
So what if it's older than me?
Help me move it. It looks better there.

343
00:53:12,470 --> 00:53:13,460
Go away.

344
00:53:14,973 --> 00:53:15,678
Move!

345
00:53:19,060 --> 00:53:23,679
You think I won't do it?
Don't! What the...

346
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:27,562
Go away, now.

347
00:53:27,694 --> 00:53:31,983
Move, I said!

348
00:53:35,577 --> 00:53:37,067
Go away, now.

349
00:53:37,287 --> 00:53:38,197
<i>Don't.</i>

350
00:53:38,288 --> 00:53:39,449
I told you to move.

351
00:53:40,081 --> 00:53:41,742
What's wrong with you?

352
00:53:42,667 --> 00:53:46,581
I warned you!
Go away!

353
00:53:46,671 --> 00:53:48,161
Here he is!

354
00:53:48,590 --> 00:53:52,959
Get away from there
Now, move!

355
00:53:58,975 --> 00:54:01,763
Grumpa!

356
00:54:29,881 --> 00:54:32,464
<i>Grumpa!
I cleaned your library all day.</i>

357
00:54:32,592 --> 00:54:35,960
- You did?
- Yes, I didn't do much...

358
00:54:37,806 --> 00:54:39,592
Grumpa, about that chest...

359
00:54:39,683 --> 00:54:43,472
I wanted to move it for your convenience
But he won't let me.

360
00:54:46,648 --> 00:54:47,763
What are you doing?

361
00:54:51,861 --> 00:54:55,149
Eungyo, let it be.

362
00:54:56,282 --> 00:55:03,279
Every wooden furniture
likes to take root in a certain place.

363
00:55:03,373 --> 00:55:06,081
It's been there since before you were born

364
00:55:06,668 --> 00:55:08,579
It won't do to uproot it.

365
00:55:10,088 --> 00:55:11,294
I'm sorry.

366
00:55:12,298 --> 00:55:16,087
Sir, the meeting date
has been set.

367
00:55:18,346 --> 00:55:20,257
It'll be on Monday over lunch.

368
00:55:20,849 --> 00:55:24,843
I made a reservation
at your favorite restaurant.

369
00:55:24,978 --> 00:55:26,184
Who's coming?

370
00:55:26,271 --> 00:55:31,983
County officials and people
from Camellia Literature Museum.

371
00:55:32,694 --> 00:55:34,276
I want to go as well.

372
00:55:36,364 --> 00:55:39,277
May I please come?

373
00:55:39,868 --> 00:55:43,361
Now you are pushing it too far.

374
00:55:44,205 --> 00:55:45,991
Why shouldn't I come?

375
00:55:46,791 --> 00:55:50,876
I can go after school
And you can give me a ride.

376
00:55:52,047 --> 00:55:54,459
- It'll be around six.
- Yes!

377
00:55:54,758 --> 00:55:55,964
They have great food there.

378
00:55:55,967 --> 00:56:02,179
Really?
Let's go, just you and me.

379
00:56:05,769 --> 00:56:10,263
By the way...
Have you read The Heart ?

380
00:56:11,191 --> 00:56:12,181
The Heart?

381
00:56:12,984 --> 00:56:15,567
You read it?

382
00:56:15,987 --> 00:56:16,692
Yes.

383
00:56:17,197 --> 00:56:19,689
How did you like it?

384
00:56:19,908 --> 00:56:22,900
I was pleasantly surprised!
It was good.

385
00:56:23,703 --> 00:56:24,693
How about you?

386
00:56:26,956 --> 00:56:33,373
It's a genre novel but not just that.

387
00:56:34,089 --> 00:56:35,375
It's poetic, and shows

388
00:56:36,591 --> 00:56:38,958
-deep introspection of human being.
- Sir...

389
00:56:40,887 --> 00:56:46,473
But I don't think he likes it.
He called it a vulgar commercial novel.

390
00:56:47,102 --> 00:56:49,389
I didn't mean that, sir.

391
00:56:49,479 --> 00:56:55,270
A parent never discards his off springs,
No matter how troublesome they may be.

392
00:57:02,784 --> 00:57:04,366
Have a drink.

393
00:57:07,455 --> 00:57:09,571
Maybe you'd like to say a word...

394
00:57:09,874 --> 00:57:17,292
Do you know how old
the girl from Camellia was?

395
00:57:19,092 --> 00:57:25,680
You mean the girl
who saved you from the communists?

396
00:57:25,682 --> 00:57:31,849
She was seventeen...
Just seventeen.

397
00:57:35,358 --> 00:57:37,144
About the Literature Museum, sir.

398
00:57:39,571 --> 00:57:40,857
I'll get going now.

399
00:57:42,365 --> 00:57:44,276
You haven't eaten at all.

400
00:57:44,492 --> 00:57:47,780
Are you leaving already?
Where are you going?

401
00:57:47,871 --> 00:57:49,987
This dinner is in your honor...

402
00:57:50,498 --> 00:57:54,867
Is it something urgent?
Perhaps meeting your girlfriend?

403
00:57:56,379 --> 00:57:57,494
Shall I show you something?

404
00:57:57,881 --> 00:57:59,588
Here, sir?

405
00:58:03,303 --> 00:58:05,010
Sir, you got a tattoo?

406
00:58:05,263 --> 00:58:08,972
Still trendy and stylish.

407
00:58:09,350 --> 00:58:11,466
Wow, that's cool.

408
00:58:12,061 --> 00:58:15,179
Wait till I'm dead
if you want to build that literary museum.

409
00:58:16,191 --> 00:58:19,684
But you'll have to wait a long time.

410
00:58:20,278 --> 00:58:22,565
Thank you for coming, sir.
I'll call you soon.

411
00:58:22,697 --> 00:58:23,983
Good bye, sir.

412
00:58:24,574 --> 00:58:29,694
They just cant wait for me to die.

413
00:58:31,206 --> 00:58:34,870
You don't build a museum
about a living person.

414
00:58:35,585 --> 00:58:36,700
I'm leaving.

415
00:58:37,212 --> 00:58:42,457
Why does Seo Jiwoo follow him
around like a dog?

416
00:58:42,967 --> 00:58:45,049
- What do you mean?
- What does he hope to get from him?

417
00:58:45,178 --> 00:58:48,261
Recognition! Just Recognition.

418
00:58:48,389 --> 00:58:49,470
Recognition?

419
00:58:49,474 --> 00:58:50,680
What else does he need?

420
00:59:22,882 --> 00:59:23,747
Grumpa!

421
00:59:27,971 --> 00:59:31,965
There's still 20 minutes left...
You've been waiting for me?

422
00:59:32,100 --> 00:59:33,181
Well...

423
01:00:09,470 --> 01:00:10,801
Have you been to a place like this?

424
01:00:10,888 --> 01:00:11,593
No.

425
01:00:11,681 --> 01:00:14,969
This is a great place to hang out.
It's divided into different themes...

426
01:00:15,101 --> 01:00:15,966
Excuse me.

427
01:00:16,894 --> 01:00:18,100
Who ordered quince tea?

428
01:00:18,187 --> 01:00:19,268
- I did.
- Grumpa did.

429
01:00:24,652 --> 01:00:25,642
Bummer!

430
01:00:25,987 --> 01:00:29,150
Sorry? Is something wrong?

431
01:00:31,492 --> 01:00:32,482
Just saying thanks.

432
01:00:33,161 --> 01:00:34,071
Thanks?

433
01:00:36,372 --> 01:00:38,158
Yes, there's nothing wrong.

434
01:00:38,291 --> 01:00:39,873
- Thank you.
- You're welcome...

435
01:00:41,002 --> 01:00:42,288
Have a good time.

436
01:00:43,671 --> 01:00:44,661
Grumpa!

437
01:00:45,089 --> 01:00:50,880
'Bummer' is an expression we use

438
01:00:51,679 --> 01:00:56,845
When we are surprised or amazed,
startled or astonished.

439
01:00:56,976 --> 01:00:59,343
That's when we use it.

440
01:00:59,354 --> 01:01:00,765
It doesn't mean thank you?

441
01:01:01,356 --> 01:01:02,266
No...

442
01:01:05,985 --> 01:01:07,350
Bodhi!

443
01:01:10,073 --> 01:01:15,364
It's a Buddhist expression
meaning you have been enlightened.

444
01:01:15,787 --> 01:01:16,993
Bodhi!

445
01:01:17,789 --> 01:01:20,281
Why? Have you been enlightened?

446
01:01:20,291 --> 01:01:24,785
This is how a teacher scolds his student
when she tries to test her teacher.

447
01:01:25,380 --> 01:01:28,372
Whatever.

448
01:02:47,670 --> 01:02:49,456
What the hell...

449
01:03:13,488 --> 01:03:14,978
<i>Is he home?</i>

450
01:03:21,579 --> 01:03:28,372
<i>Sir; are you here?</i>

451
01:03:32,590 --> 01:03:36,379
You didn't answer the phone.
I have some news.

452
01:03:36,677 --> 01:03:41,672
We decided to call it
Camellia Memorial Hall.

453
01:03:41,766 --> 01:03:43,552
We took out 'Literary Museum'
from the title.

454
01:03:44,769 --> 01:03:52,062
And they want to display
your handwritten manuscript...

455
01:03:54,695 --> 01:03:55,776
Fine.

456
01:03:56,072 --> 01:03:59,690
The county office people will be thrilled.

457
01:04:02,370 --> 01:04:05,783
Is Mr. Seo Jiwoo here?

458
01:04:06,999 --> 01:04:13,462
Bestselling authors are always busy.
So how well is The Heart selling?

459
01:04:13,548 --> 01:04:15,164
Over 800,000 copies.

460
01:04:15,758 --> 01:04:20,548
Mr. Seo made a tidy sum from the royalties.

461
01:04:20,680 --> 01:04:22,387
800,000 copies.

462
01:04:22,890 --> 01:04:28,681
We printed 30,000 copies more last week,
So it's 830,000 copies to be exact.

463
01:04:30,273 --> 01:04:35,985
Usually popularity and seriousness don't mix.

464
01:04:36,696 --> 01:04:41,987
But fortunately I think Mr. Seo
has managed both.

465
01:04:46,080 --> 01:04:51,371
You know about his latest short story?

466
01:04:52,378 --> 01:04:53,368
A short story?

467
01:04:57,383 --> 01:05:05,973
It's one of his best writings.
The literary circle is buzzing about it.

468
01:05:06,100 --> 01:05:08,091
It's that good?

469
01:05:10,688 --> 01:05:11,894
What's the title?

470
01:05:12,189 --> 01:05:14,180
You should read it.

471
01:05:14,775 --> 01:05:19,144
The title is Eungyo.

472
01:05:21,282 --> 01:05:22,272
Eungyo?

473
01:05:23,451 --> 01:05:27,160
It's the name of a high school girl.

474
01:05:31,167 --> 01:05:35,786
Sir, I'll get going now.

475
01:06:17,004 --> 01:06:18,870
Sir, good to see you.

476
01:06:19,090 --> 01:06:20,580
Where are the literary magazines?

477
01:06:21,008 --> 01:06:23,875
It's over there
at the New Arrivals sections.

478
01:06:24,595 --> 01:06:27,462
They're really popular for some reason.

479
01:06:29,850 --> 01:06:30,965
Yes, right there.

480
01:07:37,084 --> 01:07:38,449
<i>Sir; I'm here.</i>

481
01:08:01,984 --> 01:08:05,352
Would you like a cup of tea?

482
01:08:07,573 --> 01:08:10,361
I'm afraid that
you might have poisoned it.

483
01:08:28,886 --> 01:08:31,799
Do you have anything to say?

484
01:08:40,648 --> 01:08:42,264
I did it because...

485
01:08:45,653 --> 01:08:47,564
It was too beautiful.

486
01:08:50,157 --> 01:08:53,491
What?
You did it because?

487
01:08:54,662 --> 01:09:03,582
The moment I saw your manuscript,
I couldn't let such beauty waste in the chest.

488
01:09:06,298 --> 01:09:08,505
I had to let the world know...

489
01:09:08,884 --> 01:09:11,091
You call that an excuse?

490
01:09:13,472 --> 01:09:17,841
How dare you, a thief, mention beauty!

491
01:09:17,977 --> 01:09:20,344
You are the one
who made me who I am.

492
01:09:20,855 --> 01:09:21,765
What?

493
01:09:23,858 --> 01:09:26,976
You were the one who offered
to ghostwrite The Heart.

494
01:09:28,279 --> 01:09:30,771
You wanted to do it.

495
01:09:31,866 --> 01:09:34,483
You wrote it for fun!

496
01:09:34,702 --> 01:09:36,363
I considered it your salary.

497
01:09:37,371 --> 01:09:40,204
You have no talent
but you kept me company

498
01:09:40,875 --> 01:09:44,084
So I wrote it for you as gift.

499
01:09:44,503 --> 01:09:49,373
Are you regretting it now
that it's become a bestseller?

500
01:09:49,967 --> 01:09:51,674
You want to tell everyone
that you wrote it?

501
01:09:53,888 --> 01:09:55,674
The tension is driving me crazy.

502
01:09:56,265 --> 01:09:59,883
I don't know who I am any more.
Am I Seo Jiwoo or Lee Jeokyo's mask?

503
01:10:00,394 --> 01:10:04,183
What did I ever get, living as your mask?

504
01:10:04,690 --> 01:10:07,773
Money?
You want it back? The royalties?

505
01:10:07,776 --> 01:10:09,392
Shut your mouth!

506
01:10:10,195 --> 01:10:12,778
Why should this one
be any different from The Heart?

507
01:10:12,907 --> 01:10:15,274
- Stop it!
- People won't understand

508
01:10:18,078 --> 01:10:22,948
The relationship between a 70-year-old man
and a high school girl isn't love. Never!

509
01:10:24,752 --> 01:10:26,459
It's a scandal, sir...

510
01:10:27,087 --> 01:10:29,579
A dirty scandal!

511
01:10:30,466 --> 01:10:32,878
You know you won't be able to
publish it under your name.

512
01:10:32,885 --> 01:10:34,250
You know it!

513
01:10:34,762 --> 01:10:40,257
A story about a national poet
having sex with a minor?

514
01:10:41,894 --> 01:10:43,100
Dirty scandal?

515
01:10:43,979 --> 01:10:46,266
- Sir, you are an old man.
- You say it's dirty?

516
01:10:47,399 --> 01:10:50,608
Why won't you admit it?

517
01:10:51,195 --> 01:10:52,276
Son of a bitch.

518
01:10:52,655 --> 01:10:54,362
Never show your face here again.

519
01:10:54,448 --> 01:10:59,443
Your eyes are frightening.
I feel sick listening to your voice.

520
01:11:00,454 --> 01:11:01,569
You are a thief.

521
01:11:06,877 --> 01:11:08,584
You never had any potential.

522
01:11:09,880 --> 01:11:16,468
I never liked that look
in your eyes, like a wolf.

523
01:11:16,804 --> 01:11:19,671
What are you staring at?
I'll gorge your eyes out.

524
01:11:19,974 --> 01:11:23,183
You dare to call it dirty?

525
01:11:23,978 --> 01:11:25,639
You say this is a dirty scandal?

526
01:11:26,146 --> 01:11:31,482
You bastard!

527
01:12:57,071 --> 01:12:59,062
I know you're in there.

528
01:13:01,492 --> 01:13:05,360
I don't know
why you won't let me in.

529
01:13:07,247 --> 01:13:14,085
I can't concentrate on my studying,
and I'm going to mess up my exams...

530
01:13:18,759 --> 01:13:23,094
<i>Why does it hurt so much?</i>

531
01:13:28,477 --> 01:13:30,889
<i>I don't know
why it hurts so much...</i>

532
01:15:18,003 --> 01:15:20,244
<i>I could easily wrap my fingers
around Eungyo's ankle.</i>

533
01:15:21,048 --> 01:15:25,042
<i>Her heel slipped between my fingers</i>

534
01:15:25,677 --> 01:15:27,384
<i>And she giggled.</i>

535
01:15:28,764 --> 01:15:32,177
<i>Her fragrant head rested be/ow my chin</i>

536
01:15:33,268 --> 01:15:36,260
<i>And my lips were already buried
in her hair.</i>

537
01:15:37,397 --> 01:15:43,894
<i>She sighed like a pair of bellows.</i>

538
01:15:46,907 --> 01:15:49,399
<i>I held you close in my arms.</i>

539
01:15:49,701 --> 01:15:54,946
<i>I caressed your hair;
your shoulders, your waist</i>

540
01:15:55,958 --> 01:15:59,747
<i>And I put my ear to your chest
listening to your heart beating.</i>

541
01:16:01,255 --> 01:16:06,967
<i>You were so heartbreakingly beautiful.</i>

542
01:16:27,656 --> 01:16:28,566
Did you read it?

543
01:16:38,583 --> 01:16:41,075
Eungyo reads Eungyo.

544
01:16:42,462 --> 01:16:44,294
Do all writers do this?

545
01:16:45,090 --> 01:16:49,800
Stealing other people's stories,
using names without permission.

546
01:16:53,682 --> 01:16:54,797
I'm sorry.

547
01:16:57,894 --> 01:16:59,555
Did you really write this?

548
01:17:02,566 --> 01:17:07,276
How did you find out his henna?

549
01:17:09,865 --> 01:17:12,152
He told me about that.

550
01:17:13,577 --> 01:17:14,988
He told you?

551
01:17:17,372 --> 01:17:19,079
He told you about it?

552
01:17:21,501 --> 01:17:23,287
You two don't keep secrets
from each other?

553
01:17:25,088 --> 01:17:26,795
What is he to you?

554
01:17:30,594 --> 01:17:36,556
My beloved and respected teacher.

555
01:17:40,354 --> 01:17:41,560
A father figure.

556
01:17:48,362 --> 01:17:53,482
Then you tell him
everything as well?

557
01:17:59,206 --> 01:17:59,991
Yes.

558
01:18:09,174 --> 01:18:13,042
I am so pretty in the story.

559
01:18:14,262 --> 01:18:15,673
Thank you.

560
01:19:32,674 --> 01:19:34,665
Why are you doing this?

561
01:19:38,305 --> 01:19:40,387
You are doing this
because you like me?

562
01:20:00,785 --> 01:20:02,651
I'm lonely, that's why.

563
01:20:17,511 --> 01:20:21,345
Will you tell him about this?

564
01:20:59,177 --> 01:21:00,963
It's about time they called...

565
01:21:01,388 --> 01:21:07,680
They will never pick a genre novelist
or a best-selling author.

566
01:21:09,896 --> 01:21:10,681
Finally!

567
01:21:15,068 --> 01:21:16,183
Winner of annual Literary Award

568
01:21:17,279 --> 01:21:19,270
Eungyo by Seo Jiwoo!

569
01:21:27,455 --> 01:21:28,240
Really?

570
01:21:28,957 --> 01:21:30,868
Really. Eungyo is the winner.

571
01:21:32,752 --> 01:21:34,459
I won the annual Literary Award?

572
01:21:34,754 --> 01:21:36,870
I told you would win.

573
01:21:37,090 --> 01:21:38,751
The judges have gone to dinner.

574
01:21:39,593 --> 01:21:41,083
Wow...

575
01:21:43,471 --> 01:21:49,183
Has Mr. Lee Jeokyo read Eungyo?

576
01:21:53,106 --> 01:21:53,891
Yes.

577
01:21:54,107 --> 01:21:54,972
What did he say?

578
01:21:59,654 --> 01:22:01,440
He told me this.

579
01:22:03,366 --> 01:22:11,660
'It's like you went through my mind...'

580
01:22:15,170 --> 01:22:16,160
It's scary

581
01:22:39,486 --> 01:22:48,076
I thought he couldn't make it?

582
01:22:48,578 --> 01:22:49,568
What's going on?

583
01:22:49,579 --> 01:22:50,489
He's here.

584
01:22:57,003 --> 01:22:57,868
Look.

585
01:23:33,790 --> 01:23:41,459
<i>The 35th Literary Award winner is
Eungyo written by Mr. Sea Jiwool</i>

586
01:23:55,270 --> 01:23:58,058
<i>I am honored to introduce
a special guest today</i>

587
01:23:58,982 --> 01:24:02,566
He is here to give
a congratulatory speech.

588
01:24:02,777 --> 01:24:07,487
I believe this is
his first public appearance.

589
01:24:07,574 --> 01:24:11,488
<i>Mr. Sea Jiwoo has called him
a father-figure</i>

590
01:24:11,494 --> 01:24:18,662
<i>He is known for aesthetic combination of
lyric poetry with realism.</i>

591
01:24:19,753 --> 01:24:23,587
<i>The true poet of his generation!
Mr. Lee Jeokyo.</i>

592
01:24:54,579 --> 01:25:00,791
I, Lee Jeokyo, am an old man.

593
01:25:01,169 --> 01:25:05,959
Roethke referred to getting old...

594
01:25:08,468 --> 01:25:15,181
as wearing the leaden weight of
what I did not do.

595
01:25:17,310 --> 01:25:24,853
Just as your youth is
not a prize for your efforts

596
01:25:27,362 --> 01:25:35,486
My agedness is not
a penalty for my faults

597
01:25:50,301 --> 01:26:00,268
Eungyo is like sweet rain upon a dry land.

598
01:26:02,772 --> 01:26:08,063
It will be hard to
write a story more beautiful,

599
01:26:09,571 --> 01:26:16,364
more truthful, or more replete.

600
01:27:58,805 --> 01:28:02,594
Happy birthday, Grumpa!

601
01:28:12,276 --> 01:28:16,861
I got you a cake and a present.

602
01:28:42,974 --> 01:28:51,189
Grumpa, your windows are so dirty.

603
01:28:53,067 --> 01:28:55,855
Would you like me to clean it
as a birthday present?

604
01:29:07,373 --> 01:29:08,863
Eungyo's here.

605
01:29:11,502 --> 01:29:15,040
You don't seem happy to see me.

606
01:29:22,180 --> 01:29:23,466
Of course
I'm glad to see you.

607
01:29:57,590 --> 01:29:58,671
Grumpa.

608
01:30:02,386 --> 01:30:03,376
Here's salt.

609
01:30:04,680 --> 01:30:06,466
Looks really good.

610
01:30:11,896 --> 01:30:13,261
Look at this, Grumpa!

611
01:30:14,899 --> 01:30:16,481
Looks good.

612
01:30:16,692 --> 01:30:18,558
I've also brought candles.

613
01:30:20,655 --> 01:30:21,770
Let's just light one.

614
01:30:23,157 --> 01:30:23,862
What?

615
01:30:24,450 --> 01:30:26,282
Light just one candle.

616
01:30:28,454 --> 01:30:29,569
Okay.

617
01:30:44,303 --> 01:30:47,967
Our famous writer is here.

618
01:30:51,644 --> 01:30:52,475
<i>Sir...</i>

619
01:31:05,366 --> 01:31:08,074
Happy birthday.

620
01:31:19,505 --> 01:31:22,497
I'll get going now.

621
01:31:29,056 --> 01:31:34,768
He's diabetic.
He can't eat cake.

622
01:31:41,777 --> 01:31:42,858
Mr. Seo!

623
01:31:46,365 --> 01:31:48,072
Come here.

624
01:31:48,784 --> 01:31:50,366
Have a drink before you go.

625
01:32:48,761 --> 01:32:49,967
Try it.

626
01:32:51,681 --> 01:32:52,762
Let's see..

627
01:32:57,687 --> 01:33:01,180
How's my salad, my soup?

628
01:33:02,400 --> 01:33:03,765
It's very good.

629
01:33:04,402 --> 01:33:05,563
It is, isn't it?

630
01:33:07,947 --> 01:33:12,657
Grumpa, do you know
when they started drinking wine?

631
01:33:14,370 --> 01:33:20,867
A 4,000-year-old wine bottle
was found in Georgia.

632
01:33:21,669 --> 01:33:23,785
It's almost as old as human race.

633
01:33:25,965 --> 01:33:29,378
Why do you keep asking him
questions instead of me?

634
01:33:30,177 --> 01:33:31,167
Don't bother him.

635
01:33:32,096 --> 01:33:35,305
You never have good answers.

636
01:33:35,683 --> 01:33:38,471
It's easier when he explains things.

637
01:33:38,561 --> 01:33:43,271
You are too... loose.
A typical engineer!

638
01:33:43,274 --> 01:33:45,766
I don't know
how he became a writer, do you?

639
01:33:47,278 --> 01:33:50,487
What's wrong with majoring in engineering?

640
01:33:52,158 --> 01:33:57,153
Did you write poetry like him?
Like Grumpa?

641
01:34:01,667 --> 01:34:06,161
I wanted to write poetry.
I desperately wanted to.

642
01:34:06,297 --> 01:34:09,506
You started writing novels
because you couldn't write poems?

643
01:34:11,010 --> 01:34:12,842
Then poetry is the highest level?

644
01:34:18,851 --> 01:34:20,967
Poetry is higher.

645
01:34:36,869 --> 01:34:37,859
Did you know that

646
01:34:40,790 --> 01:34:43,873
Me, Seo Jiwoo the genre novelist,

647
01:34:47,671 --> 01:34:51,881
People scorned me

648
01:34:53,052 --> 01:34:55,464
But now they worship me.

649
01:34:55,971 --> 01:34:59,384
Just because I won a prize.

650
01:35:01,477 --> 01:35:07,268
The mighty critics
who never once called me

651
01:35:10,277 --> 01:35:13,065
Now can't get enough of me.

652
01:35:14,573 --> 01:35:16,189
So you are noble, so what?

653
01:35:19,954 --> 01:35:23,447
So you are a national poet, sir,
So what?

654
01:35:23,958 --> 01:35:30,580
The key is to succeed.

655
01:35:30,881 --> 01:35:31,962
No matter what!

656
01:35:33,759 --> 01:35:38,174
I'm no longer a mask.

657
01:35:39,765 --> 01:35:41,597
I'm Seo Jiwoo and...

658
01:35:43,269 --> 01:35:48,890
I'm really going to succeed, sir.

659
01:35:52,945 --> 01:35:54,356
I have a quiz for you.

660
01:35:57,158 --> 01:36:00,867
I want you to be
my student in next life.

661
01:36:04,582 --> 01:36:07,449
Why do you think I do?

662
01:36:08,169 --> 01:36:09,455
That's the quiz?

663
01:36:12,089 --> 01:36:14,376
To make him
do my laundry and cooking.

664
01:36:26,770 --> 01:36:30,138
I'm drunk.
I'll go to bed now.

665
01:36:31,650 --> 01:36:33,357
Eungyo should go home now.

666
01:36:34,361 --> 01:36:37,649
Didn't you say you have
breakfast meeting tomorrow?

667
01:36:38,365 --> 01:36:39,355
Go to bed.

668
01:36:41,160 --> 01:36:42,571
It's not a breakfast meeting...

669
01:36:42,786 --> 01:36:44,777
It's a lecture...

670
01:36:45,873 --> 01:36:47,580
Yes, sir, good night.

671
01:36:49,502 --> 01:36:56,590
I can do without some sleep.
I'm still young.

672
01:36:57,176 --> 01:36:58,837
Sir, thank you very much.

673
01:37:00,679 --> 01:37:04,843
You turned an engineer into a writer

674
01:37:09,063 --> 01:37:12,852
<i>Who didn't know anything about stars.
Thank you, sir.</i>

675
01:37:20,699 --> 01:37:24,192
Happy birthday Grumpa.

676
01:37:35,881 --> 01:37:37,463
Good night.

677
01:38:22,761 --> 01:38:24,092
I should go to bed.

678
01:39:18,567 --> 01:39:21,275
Good night, Eungyo.

679
01:41:57,100 --> 01:41:58,556
<i>Here? This shallow part?</i>

680
01:41:58,644 --> 01:41:59,759
<i>You are ticklish here?</i>

681
01:42:03,774 --> 01:42:05,139
<i>Here, and here...</i>

682
01:42:06,568 --> 01:42:07,854
Don 't...

683
01:43:50,756 --> 01:43:54,966
How much do you care for me?

684
01:43:56,178 --> 01:43:58,590
How much...

685
01:46:14,691 --> 01:46:18,400
Do you know why
teenage girls have sex?

686
01:46:20,989 --> 01:46:22,275
Because you care for me...

687
01:46:24,493 --> 01:46:26,154
You came back
because you care for me.

688
01:46:38,882 --> 01:46:47,677
I'm lonely, too.
That's why.

689
01:50:06,172 --> 01:50:08,288
Who fiddled with the engine?

690
01:50:09,801 --> 01:50:11,883
The handle has no control.

691
01:50:12,095 --> 01:50:13,961
You are lucky to be alive!

692
01:50:15,098 --> 01:50:16,463
Is it because the car is old?

693
01:50:16,599 --> 01:50:17,805
No...

694
01:50:18,476 --> 01:50:19,966
Someone loosened it.

695
01:50:20,061 --> 01:50:20,766
Loosened it?

696
01:50:20,854 --> 01:50:21,559
Yes.

697
01:50:22,272 --> 01:50:28,359
If someone loosened it,
it means he did it on purpose.

698
01:50:28,486 --> 01:50:31,148
If he did,
he meant to kill you.

699
01:50:31,781 --> 01:50:33,647
Who messed with this car?

700
01:50:34,367 --> 01:50:36,278
And it's fairly recent.

701
01:50:37,078 --> 01:50:41,993
Look here, no oil marks.

702
01:50:45,378 --> 01:50:49,497
See how dangerous
an amateur job can be?

703
01:50:50,175 --> 01:50:54,544
People think internet is
all they need to fix a car.

704
01:51:06,066 --> 01:51:10,856
Did you think I'd let
that old man get to me?

705
01:51:24,376 --> 01:51:25,662
I can see inside your head!

706
01:51:26,169 --> 01:51:28,661
I know all about it, old man.

707
01:51:43,978 --> 01:51:45,059
Fuck“.

708
01:52:10,964 --> 01:52:15,083
My beloved, respected teacher

709
01:52:15,885 --> 01:52:19,674
How could he do this to me?

710
01:52:21,891 --> 01:52:23,598
After all I've done...

711
01:52:24,477 --> 01:52:29,267
No son could have been more loyal.

712
01:54:13,545 --> 01:54:19,541
<i>You have one new message.</i>

713
01:54:25,557 --> 01:54:26,672
<i>I...</i>

714
01:54:32,480 --> 01:54:37,566
<i>killed... Sea Jiwoo.</i>

715
01:57:47,467 --> 01:57:48,582
Grumpa,

716
01:57:53,389 --> 01:57:54,174
You are wasted.

717
01:58:19,165 --> 01:58:20,451
<i>My mom...</i>

718
01:58:25,797 --> 01:58:28,084
Her heels are cracking again

719
01:58:31,385 --> 01:58:32,466
like a tree bark...

720
01:58:41,479 --> 01:58:46,474
she's shaving it
with a knife again.

721
01:58:49,362 --> 01:58:52,480
Crouching down.

722
01:58:55,284 --> 01:58:57,070
I was watching her

723
01:59:00,998 --> 01:59:02,989
When it suddenly came back to me.

724
01:59:16,556 --> 01:59:22,552
Remember the night
I came here?

725
02:00:00,975 --> 02:00:02,386
That moment...

726
02:00:06,480 --> 02:00:07,686
That air...

727
02:00:09,400 --> 02:00:10,390
That temperature...

728
02:00:11,068 --> 02:00:11,899
That humidity...

729
02:00:14,405 --> 02:00:15,395
That warmth...

730
02:00:18,367 --> 02:00:25,455
Some things can never be felt
no matter how hard you tell.

731
02:00:27,752 --> 02:00:38,675
Even if you had told someone,
a third person can never describe it.

732
02:00:43,100 --> 02:00:49,267
An engineer...
Who thinks all mirrors are the same...

733
02:00:49,607 --> 02:00:51,097
How could he know...

734
02:01:03,871 --> 02:01:06,283
Eungyo belongs to you...

735
02:01:13,089 --> 02:01:17,674
You wrote Eungyo...

736
02:01:26,560 --> 02:01:27,971
<i>Thank you...</i>

737
02:01:32,858 --> 02:01:35,145
Thank you for making me
so pretty in the story.

738
02:01:38,990 --> 02:01:48,991
I didn't know I was so pretty.

739
02:01:54,005 --> 02:01:57,088
I had no idea.

740
02:02:09,687 --> 02:02:11,849
I didn't know anything
like an idiot.

741
02:02:13,566 --> 02:02:17,685
I was just a big-headed idiot.

742
02:02:21,574 --> 02:02:23,565
I was so stupid.

743
02:03:34,480 --> 02:03:36,391
Good bye, Grumpa.

744
02:04:09,181 --> 02:04:10,387
Good bye

745
02:04:12,560 --> 02:04:13,846
Eungyo...
