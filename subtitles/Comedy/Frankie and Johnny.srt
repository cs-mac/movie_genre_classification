1
00:02:05,042 --> 00:02:09,673
Boss, they just stopped a customer
from betting a roll of these. Why?

2
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:12,307
Why? Because that's Confederate money.

3
00:02:12,591 --> 00:02:13,934
Money's money, ain't it?

4
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:16,686
Blackie, I don't know what I'd do
without you.

5
00:02:17,763 --> 00:02:19,436
- You'd manage.
-Thanks.

6
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:24,315
Escort the gentleman gently to the deck
and kick him down the gangplank.

7
00:02:24,603 --> 00:02:25,980
No more bets.

8
00:02:28,023 --> 00:02:29,991
You seen Johnny? It's nearly showtime.

9
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:32,824
Yeah, he made his daily contribution.
He went that way.

10
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:35,284
- The rabbit's foot didn't help?
-Help?

11
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:36,915
He lost that, too.

12
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:41,499
Okay, new shooter. Come on out.

13
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,257
Johnny?

14
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:50,011
Twelve straight times he drew cards to 12,
on account of today is the 12th.

15
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:51,922
He didn't even win once?

16
00:02:52,214 --> 00:02:53,431
With me dealing?

17
00:02:56,385 --> 00:02:58,638
- Piano player.
-Yes, Mr. Braden.

18
00:02:58,929 --> 00:03:00,727
Try to play the notes
the way they're written.

19
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:02,140
I'll use both hands.

20
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:05,811
And if Johnny is late again,
I hope he can dance with a broken leg.

21
00:03:06,103 --> 00:03:09,698
That's what I like about you, boss.
Always ready with a pat on the back.

22
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:11,324
Place your bets.

23
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:16,496
- You seen Johnny?
-Look under the nearest pair of dice.

24
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:19,784
- Don't you even say hello to your wife?
-Hello, wife.

25
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:23,454
Peg, how can I get Johnny
to give up gambling?

26
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:28,676
Easy. A bullet in the head,
poison in his coffee, a fatal knife wound.

27
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:29,926
Nothing to it.

28
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:33,721
Where have you been?
I lost your trail at the blackjack table.

29
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:36,508
Ran into a guy who told me
about a gypsy fortuneteller.

30
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,473
She's got a hot cup of tea leaves.

31
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,558
I'm a coffee man myself.

32
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:45,226
What happened with your astrologer?
Couldn't read the stars on a cloudy night?

33
00:03:45,517 --> 00:03:47,861
- You got to have faith, Cully.
-And money.

34
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:50,489
- How much did you lose tonight?
-How much did I have?

35
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:53,776
That's what you lost last night.
You're holding your own.

36
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:00,616
Seven years bad luck.

37
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:04,794
- It was already cracked.
-Okay, only five.

38
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,705
Be over before you know it.

39
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:12,044
Say, five. That's a hunch. Loan me $5.

40
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:13,712
I can't afford you much longer.

41
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:16,678
- Put the $5 on number 5.
<i>-l'll</i> lose my job if I'm late.

42
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:19,013
I'll lose my confidence
if l pass up a hunch bet.

43
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:35,442
Hello, Johnny.

44
00:04:35,734 --> 00:04:36,986
Hello, Johnny.

45
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:39,572
Say goodbye, Johnny.

46
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:44,543
They're wearing mittens out there tonight.

47
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:47,337
- They just don't appreciate talent.
-No.

48
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:51,584
- On stage for the Petunia number.
-Always brings me luck, you know.

49
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:53,502
You need a new horseshoe.

50
00:05:06,515 --> 00:05:07,858
I've got a gal

51
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:10,443
Oh, what a pal

52
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:14,235
The apple of my eye

53
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:17,200
We're something rare

54
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:20,244
A peach of a pair

55
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:25,117
But her dad won't let us meet
and I could die

56
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:30,960
I love Petunia

57
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:33,250
The gardener's daughter

58
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:36,470
Oh, how that gal can kiss

59
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:39,510
My eyes are blue as bluebells

60
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:41,641
Each cheek a rose to see

61
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:45,304
How I dance when she plants
her two lips on me

62
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:49,058
He's as daffy as a daffodil

63
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:52,569
He loves to kiss me all the time

64
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:56,448
Tonight I'll steal into her garden

65
00:05:56,982 --> 00:06:00,236
And make Petunia's two lips mine

66
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:24,890
She makes other girls look just like weeds

67
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:28,305
I wanna be his clinging vine

68
00:06:28,597 --> 00:06:32,318
Tonight I'll steal into her garden

69
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:35,437
And make Petunia's two lips

70
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:38,861
My ever-loving two lips

71
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:46,832
Make Petunia's two lips mine

72
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:11,273
- What were those signals?
-What signals?

73
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:13,433
Between you and Cully. I'm not blind.

74
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:16,274
Those signals. Nothing.
He just made a little bet for me.

75
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:19,030
Now you've got helpers.
Can't you lose fast enough alone?

76
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:25,870
- Where're you going?
-To have my head examined.

77
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:29,829
- There must be a hole in it.
-You can't help it if you're in love.

78
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:32,289
You're born losers, both of you!

79
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:36,377
- What's the matter with her?
-She's crazy about the wrong guy. Me.

80
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:38,917
I am a loser.

81
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,930
But if l had $20, I could be a winner.

82
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:45,762
I hate myself for asking, but how?

83
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:48,222
This gypsy fortuneteller
parked across the river,

84
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:50,888
I hear everyone who takes her advice
is getting rich.

85
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:54,023
- So how come she lives in a wagon?
-The wagon is loaded with gold.

86
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:55,934
You got $20?

87
00:07:56,226 --> 00:07:58,479
Lucky for you, it just so happens...

88
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:01,740
You are the lowest person that ever lived.

89
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:06,278
- Peg, my sweetheart, you've missed me.
-You're not what I've missed.

90
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:08,116
-No?
-NO!

91
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:12,751
I've missed the $50
I hid in my winter lingerie.

92
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:15,583
You know, I never could keep out of your...

93
00:08:17,706 --> 00:08:19,174
You didn't have to stab me.

94
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:23,303
I should've listened to my sainted mother.
She said you were just like my father.

95
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:25,429
I could never drink that much.

96
00:08:25,714 --> 00:08:29,264
Don't you dare say one word
about my drunken old man.

97
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:33,772
- Where's the money?
-I lost it, Peg, all of it. Honest.

98
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:37,605
- And he loaned me the last $5.
-Now you stay out of this.

99
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:39,815
Just to convince me,
you take off your shoes.

100
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:41,525
- My Shoes?
-0ff!

101
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:44,941
Love and trust.
That's what makes a marriage great.

102
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:48,953
See? I could never lie to you.

103
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:55,248
Well, there's a $10 lie.

104
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:58,379
- Now, how did that get in there?
-I wonder.

105
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:05,219
Good bye, GYPSY-

106
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:19,893
Hello, Zolita.

107
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:29,160
Business is awful.

108
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:32,705
Why don't you have a talk
with your crystal ball?

109
00:09:33,865 --> 00:09:35,867
Maybe these are two live ones.

110
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:43,090
What shall I promise them?

111
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:46,548
A long journey or sudden wealth?

112
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:49,806
As long as it costs you nothing,
give them both.

113
00:09:52,884 --> 00:09:55,933
Gentlemen, you have come
to the right place.

114
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:59,521
The one, the only, the incomparable Zolita.

115
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:02,894
The kid's got problems.

116
00:10:03,186 --> 00:10:05,609
Keeps breaking mirrors
and walking under black cats.

117
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:08,696
Yes, my son,

118
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:12,366
you look troubled. Deeply troubled.

119
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:15,365
No, it's worse than that.
I can't break my losing streak.

120
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:18,330
You are a gambling man.

121
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:21,872
Every cent I make.
I could sure use some motherly advice.

122
00:10:22,914 --> 00:10:27,465
Mother Zolita can only interpret, my son.

123
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:31,598
Perhaps the tea leaves will forecast failure,
perhaps success.

124
00:10:32,257 --> 00:10:36,387
I am merely a princess with a rare gift

125
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:40,182
handed down
from generation to generation.

126
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:43,317
- Didn't I tell you she was great?
-She hasn't said anything yet.

127
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,278
The leaves are ready to speak.

128
00:11:01,244 --> 00:11:02,245
No lemon?

129
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:08,551
The tea leaves have spoken.

130
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:12,214
If you do not mind, I work alone.

131
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,263
What do they spell, Mother?

132
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,557
How lucky you are.

133
00:11:22,974 --> 00:11:26,148
The wheel of fortune
has stopped at your number.

134
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:29,815
- A wheel? That's roulette.
-And I see a dice table, too.

135
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:32,700
No blackjack? This boy plays all games.

136
00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:35,863
And a new woman is coming into your life.

137
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:39,157
Beautiful young redhead.

138
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:42,793
It can't be a redhead, Princess.
My girl's a blonde.

139
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:44,546
Take another look.

140
00:11:44,996 --> 00:11:46,714
Now I see a blonde.

141
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:49,676
But she has been bad luck for you.

142
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:53,930
The tea leaves say
you will have good luck with the redhead.

143
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:57,468
I know better. I married one.
Take the advice of a 20-year loser.

144
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:01,138
- No redheads.
-He must not defy the tea leaves.

145
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:03,102
How're you gonna explain her to Frankie?

146
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:05,892
Why explain?
We'll just use her to make a bundle.

147
00:12:06,184 --> 00:12:09,404
You're going to pass off a beautiful redhead
as a good-luck piece?

148
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:10,609
Good luck.

149
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:14,943
- If I may be so crude...
-Sure.

150
00:12:17,028 --> 00:12:21,499
If you please, the princess never soils
her royal hands with money.

151
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:23,497
$10?

152
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:27,880
When the tea leaves promise
a beautiful redhead, it is $20.

153
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,218
A lot of money for a cup of tea.

154
00:12:33,795 --> 00:12:34,796
That's a gypsy for you.

155
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:37,386
Takes all your dough,
so you can't take her advice.

156
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:40,518
Minor problems like that I cannot solve.

157
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:43,938
Maybe you can get
another advance from Braden.

158
00:12:44,222 --> 00:12:46,725
Not a chance.
I'm already in for five weeks' salary.

159
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:51,271
That you lost right back into his pocket.
Braden's got a nice little thing going there.

160
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:52,571
Don't worry.

161
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:55,483
Did you ever know a gambler who
couldn't promote some betting money?

162
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:59,200
- You also need chesay.
-Chesay? Who's that?

163
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:02,331
Chesay is gypsy good luck. Lazlo!

164
00:13:06,077 --> 00:13:12,756
Drink a cup of gypsy luck

165
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:15,420
Just tip it up

166
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:18,807
And then you just say chesay

167
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:21,969
Swallow once then swallow twice

168
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:25,560
Goes down so nice
Just say chesay, hey!

169
00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:29,234
What's in the drink, chase the devil away?

170
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:32,236
Lightning, I think, so just say chesay

171
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:35,949
Chesay, chesay
Brings you good luck night and day

172
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:38,826
Chesay, chesay
That's the gypsy way

173
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:40,987
Trouble is my middle name

174
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:42,701
Though it's such a crying shame

175
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:45,242
Try and try, there's nothing I can do

176
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,793
But I'm feeling kinda strange

177
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:49,454
Feel like things are gonna change

178
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:52,249
Time my lucky star was shining through

179
00:13:52,874 --> 00:13:56,128
Chesay, chesay
Brings you good luck night and day

180
00:13:56,419 --> 00:13:59,639
Chesay, chesay
That's the gypsy way

181
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:02,391
Drink a cup of gypsy luck

182
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:03,892
Just tip it up

183
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:06,475
And then you just say chesay

184
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:09,266
Swallow once then swallow twice

185
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:12,686
Goes down so nice
Just say chesay, hey!

186
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:16,406
What's in the drink, chase the devil away?

187
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:19,442
Magic, I think, so just say chesay

188
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:23,155
Chesay, chesay
Brings you good luck night and day

189
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:26,416
Chesay, chesay
That's the gypsy way

190
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:29,669
Chesay, chesay
Brings you good luck night and day

191
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:32,455
Chesay, chesay
That's the gypsy way

192
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:35,708
Chesay, chesay
Brings you good luck night and day

193
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,799
Chesay, chesay
That's the gypsy way, chesay

194
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:43,675
Have you seen Cully?
He's been missing for an hour.

195
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:47,846
- Tried the Lost and Found Department?
-No, I'm afraid they'll find him.

196
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:52,108
I always know where to find Johnny.
In the casino, losing his shirt.

197
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:56,818
With the way the other girls look at him,
you're lucky he isn't playing around.

198
00:14:57,355 --> 00:14:59,858
You know what I'd do
if he ever did me wrong?

199
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:02,277
- Shoot yourself?
-No, him.

200
00:15:10,493 --> 00:15:14,623
One last request before I cross
the great footlights up yonder.

201
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:17,299
Like what?

202
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:21,213
Like, would you loan me $25
so I can pay Cully what I owe him?

203
00:15:21,504 --> 00:15:23,882
Cully loaned you $25? Where did he get it?

204
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:25,641
Between my nightgown and my petticoat.

205
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:29,053
Do you know how much
you owe me already?

206
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:30,813
Who's counting?

207
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:32,895
You sure you don't want
this money to gamble?

208
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:37,028
Word of honor, cross my heart,
and may you never kiss me again.

209
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:38,904
You sound sincere.

210
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:40,815
What would you do, Peg?

211
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:44,281
What any woman with an ounce of pride
or self-respect would do.

212
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:45,536
Give him the money.

213
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,422
Greatest little bank in America.

214
00:15:58,416 --> 00:15:59,759
Two greatest little banks in America.

215
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:03,004
What a shame you don't have
an account there.

216
00:16:07,008 --> 00:16:08,976
$5, $10...

217
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:14,774
$15, $20, $25. Makes us even, right?

218
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:16,604
I didn't think you'd get a dime from Frankie.

219
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:19,112
- How much you got left to play with?
-l'm broke.

220
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:22,482
But I got a rich friend who will loan <i>me...</i>

221
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:26,452
$5, $10, $15, $20, $25.

222
00:16:26,736 --> 00:16:29,990
- You better count it to be sure it's all there.
-What for? I trust you.

223
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,788
Now all we need is a beautiful redhead.

224
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:39,420
Nellie!

225
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:41,379
Nellie Bly!

226
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:43,507
Hello, Blackie.

227
00:16:45,213 --> 00:16:47,807
You look great.
How did New York treat you?

228
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:51,640
They didn't believe my billing,
“The Singing Queen of the Riverboats.“

229
00:16:51,928 --> 00:16:55,148
- How's the action?
-The boss never had it rolling in so fast.

230
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:56,478
Money isn't everything,

231
00:16:56,766 --> 00:16:59,440
but it never made a man
look less attractive.

232
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:03,698
- Put those in my old room, will you, Mac?
-Does Mr. Braden know you're back?

233
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:06,200
No, I want to surprise him.
Is he in his office?

234
00:17:06,484 --> 00:17:08,327
You don't want to surprise him now.

235
00:17:08,611 --> 00:17:11,660
Why don't you go in and win a few bucks
until he spruces up for you?

236
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:13,200
Who is she?

237
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:17,121
That's not nice.
Has Mr. Braden ever cheated on you?

238
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:20,331
- Well, has he?
-Still protecting him, aren't you?

239
00:17:20,623 --> 00:17:23,672
Why not?
Who bailed me out and got me a job?

240
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,837
And who made a gentleman out of me?
And who...

241
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:28,381
Okay. Go ring the fire bell.

242
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:32,894
Tell Braden I'll meet him in the casino
after I pretty up for him.

243
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,314
Are you really going to
make me a star, Mr. Braden?

244
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:43,696
It's not me that'll do it, Mitzi.
It's your talent.

245
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,982
I do have talent, don't I?

246
00:17:46,274 --> 00:17:48,117
You're loaded with it.

247
00:17:51,946 --> 00:17:54,369
Boss, you got one girl too many.

248
00:17:54,657 --> 00:17:56,330
Nellie Bly just came aboard.

249
00:17:58,286 --> 00:18:00,334
When you've got a message
like that, whisper.

250
00:18:01,706 --> 00:18:05,802
Nellie's in the casino waiting for you.
She doesn't know about you and Mitzi.

251
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:08,842
It's happened to me again?

252
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:11,132
I don't get my name in lights?

253
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:13,426
You just don't have the talent, Mitzi.

254
00:18:13,718 --> 00:18:14,765
But a minute ago, you said...

255
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:16,645
The only woman
who ever gave me bubbles,

256
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:18,977
like that champagne,just came back.

257
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:22,018
And she's funny.
She thinks three is a crowd.

258
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,854
Why, you...

259
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:38,542
Hi, Mitzi.

260
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:42,338
- The boss in a bad mood again?
-Bad?

261
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:45,717
He never felt better.
His favorite girl came back.

262
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,798
I thought you were.

263
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:51,009
I just found out
I've been understudying the part.

264
00:18:51,881 --> 00:18:54,680
In my next life, I hope I'm not a girl.

265
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:57,390
I could never go through that again.

266
00:18:59,889 --> 00:19:03,063
- Twenty-six, black. Even.
-Let's try another table.

267
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:08,481
All blondes. I can't go against Zolita.

268
00:19:08,773 --> 00:19:10,446
You're too darn particular.

269
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:13,156
The gypsy said a redhead,
and a redhead it's gotta be.

270
00:19:13,444 --> 00:19:17,369
Then we're wasting our time here.
Seven blondes. Not one redhead.

271
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:19,785
Seven. That's a hunch bet
if ever I heard one.

272
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:22,044
- One stack, please.
<i>-l'll</i> tell the gypsy on you.

273
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:24,126
- Place your bets.
-On seven.

274
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:28,755
- No, lady. That's the kiss of death.
-l'm sorry.

275
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:30,461
Off seven.

276
00:19:30,753 --> 00:19:32,801
Hold it, Johnny.
Maybe that's your lucky redhead.

277
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:36,308
- Are you?
-The action's over there.

278
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:37,684
No more bets.

279
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:46,478
Seven. A winner. Red.

280
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:48,779
Thirty-five times twenty.

281
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,444
You would've won $700!

282
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:54,611
If she can do it once, she can do it again.
Are you a real redhead?

283
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:56,324
I'm a real everything.

284
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:58,489
- What's your lucky number?
-One.

285
00:19:58,781 --> 00:20:00,499
- One at a time.
-One it is.

286
00:20:00,783 --> 00:20:02,330
Would you mind giving them
your magic touch?

287
00:20:03,411 --> 00:20:04,628
Just for luck.

288
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:07,336
You better get the bottom one, too.

289
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:08,795
Place your bets.

290
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:13,008
By this time tomorrow,
this ship should be the 5.5. Johnny.

291
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:15,423
- What's your name, lucky?
- Nellie Bly.

292
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:17,888
- Welcome aboard.
- That's it, Bly!

293
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:20,553
I need a name to rhyme with “eye“
for a new song I'm writing.

294
00:20:20,845 --> 00:20:22,973
Now I got it. Nellie Bly.

295
00:20:23,264 --> 00:20:26,143
- You're gonna be made famous in a song.
- l've tried every other way.

296
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:32,740
I don't even have to look.
I know it's going to be number one.

297
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:35,485
One, red!

298
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:40,036
- Maybe that gypsy knew something.
-Maybe? My future just got here.

299
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:41,289
$100.

300
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:43,993
-$200.
-Place your bets.

301
00:20:44,535 --> 00:20:45,536
$300.

302
00:20:45,828 --> 00:20:47,876
- This is the big break I've been...
-$400.

303
00:20:48,164 --> 00:20:50,713
- Where'd she go? It was going good.
-What about these chips?

304
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,343
Keep counting. I'll be right back.

305
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:56,756
Nellie, it's been a long year without you.
You never looked better.

306
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:59,175
You have.
Who's been keeping you up nights?

307
00:20:59,467 --> 00:21:00,935
Who can remember names?

308
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:06,266
- What kind of a kiss is that?
-We're not starting where we left off.

309
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:10,861
I like a girl who remembers
the good things in life.

310
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:21,455
I thought you came back
because you missed me.

311
00:21:21,739 --> 00:21:24,083
I came back because
I wasn't good enough for Broadway.

312
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:27,791
L'm big in the small time
and small in the big time.

313
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:30,581
You'll always be my star attraction.

314
00:21:30,873 --> 00:21:32,295
What about the girl last week?

315
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:34,551
And the girl before her,
and the one before...

316
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:38,089
- A man gets lonely.
-Lonely enough to get married?

317
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,178
You're not going to
bring up marriage again?

318
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:44,096
- My mother recommends it highly.
-Your mother doesn't know me.

319
00:21:45,054 --> 00:21:48,354
What would you do
if I got big eyes for someone else?

320
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:51,436
- Nothing.
-Nothing?

321
00:21:51,894 --> 00:21:57,401
I might arrange to have his neck broken,
but outside of that, nothing. Come here.

322
00:21:57,858 --> 00:22:00,702
Boss. One of the customers
wants to raise the limit.

323
00:22:01,195 --> 00:22:03,323
- How's he doing?
-Big loser.

324
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:05,912
Losers we always accommodate.

325
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:10,125
Don't shuffle the cards. I'll be right back.

326
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:20,677
- You can't do that to me.
-Hello again.

327
00:22:20,965 --> 00:22:22,717
- Do what?
-Disappear.

328
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:25,978
You may not believe this,
but our meeting tonight was no accident.

329
00:22:26,262 --> 00:22:28,185
- The gypsy sent you.
-Gypsy?

330
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:29,940
Who believes in them?

331
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:31,559
I do.

332
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:34,775
This fortuneteller told me a gorgeous
redhead would come into my life.

333
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:37,155
That'd be the luckiest thing
to happen to me.

334
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:39,487
I'm a gorgeous rabbit's foot, is that it?

335
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:42,619
- You don't know how badly I need you.
-Tell me more.

336
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:44,245
Hello, boss.

337
00:22:45,698 --> 00:22:48,702
- I finally found my good-luck charm.
-Did you, now?

338
00:22:48,993 --> 00:22:52,543
Sure. With Nellie beside me, I'll break
every casino here before I'm through.

339
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:55,504
You're through now.
Didn't you tell him who you are?

340
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:57,213
I don't even know who he is.

341
00:22:57,501 --> 00:23:02,177
Well, allow me.
Johnny, my number one girl, Nellie Bly.

342
00:23:02,965 --> 00:23:05,684
How about that?
She means a lot to both of us.

343
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:09,939
- She's private stock, all 120 pounds of her.
-118.

344
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:13,521
Weren't you due on stage five minutes ago?

345
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:15,151
Ten.

346
00:23:20,566 --> 00:23:22,694
Forget it, Nellie. He's spoken for.

347
00:23:22,985 --> 00:23:24,237
Yes, but I'm not.

348
00:23:25,029 --> 00:23:28,203
To show you how worried I am,
let's go hear lover boy sing.

349
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:33,454
Wise men have known

350
00:23:33,871 --> 00:23:36,340
Women can't live alone

351
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:43,553
So a woman should understand

352
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:48,602
That what every woman lives for

353
00:23:49,303 --> 00:23:52,352
What every woman lives for

354
00:23:53,015 --> 00:23:58,863
Is to give her love to a man

355
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:07,701
He may not be the kind
you find in picture books

356
00:24:08,322 --> 00:24:15,080
A real-life hero
with dashing handsome looks

357
00:24:16,956 --> 00:24:22,713
He may not be the guy
that you've been dreaming of

358
00:24:23,379 --> 00:24:29,432
But that won't stop you
from giving him your love

359
00:24:31,929 --> 00:24:35,058
So, dear, can't you see

360
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:38,607
That it was meant to be

361
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:41,071
It's part

362
00:24:42,564 --> 00:24:45,488
Part of our destiny

363
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:50,619
'Cause what every woman lives for

364
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:54,827
What every woman lives for

365
00:24:55,160 --> 00:25:01,418
Is to give her love to a man

366
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:08,883
And I hope that man is me

367
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:22,612
Johnny likes her.

368
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:27,652
Maybe it'll be one big, happy triangle,
and I'll come out on the right side.

369
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:36,664
What is this?
You wouldn't talk to me last night or today.

370
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:37,748
What did I do?

371
00:25:38,037 --> 00:25:41,837
Who smiled at Nellie Bly last night,
like she was the only girl in the world?

372
00:25:42,124 --> 00:25:44,172
- Who is she, anyway?
-You really want to know?

373
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:47,464
- I really want to know.
-Where do you think I got this?

374
00:25:47,755 --> 00:25:50,679
- You robbed a bank.
-$700, and I owe it all to her.

375
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:52,343
You owe it all to me.

376
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:55,638
I got nothing but admiration
for a man who pays his debts.

377
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:58,557
Now we're even, give or take a few dollars.

378
00:25:59,725 --> 00:26:01,523
When I win, I lose.

379
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:03,027
Who hates you up there?

380
00:26:03,312 --> 00:26:08,569
If you see her again, and my advice is don't,
thank Nellie Bly for me.

381
00:26:08,859 --> 00:26:10,202
Somebody page me?

382
00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:13,782
Anybody I haven't met yet, I'm Nellie Bly.

383
00:26:14,073 --> 00:26:17,077
I'm Mitzi, last week's kisses.

384
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:20,045
Well, don't go away.
You might get him back on the rebound.

385
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:21,955
Rebound?

386
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:24,667
I'm the original rubber ball.

387
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:29,012
- Looks like Mitzi's got her hands full.
-Looks like you have.

388
00:26:30,214 --> 00:26:31,932
- Hello, everybody.
-Hello.

389
00:26:32,216 --> 00:26:33,968
I heard you wrote a new number I'll be in.

390
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:37,388
- That's the one I told you about.
-Frankie, this is Nellie.

391
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:41,104
- Shake hands and come out fighting.
-I just might do that.

392
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:43,189
Your claws are showing.

393
00:26:43,477 --> 00:26:44,945
And they scratch.

394
00:26:45,229 --> 00:26:47,231
I hear you're Braden's girl, off and on.

395
00:26:47,523 --> 00:26:50,367
-L'm nobody's girl.
-Let's keep it that way.

396
00:26:51,777 --> 00:26:54,246
Could we stop wasting time and rehearse?

397
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:58,160
- You written lots of hits?
-A trunk full. Wait till Joe hears this one.

398
00:26:58,450 --> 00:26:59,747
Joe, the deckhand?

399
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:02,254
Joe Wilbur, the music publisher
from New York.

400
00:27:02,538 --> 00:27:03,710
He'll be out here next week.

401
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:07,509
It's money in the bank if he likes it.
Money you can keep.

402
00:27:08,085 --> 00:27:10,133
- For how long?
-We own half the song.

403
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:13,014
On account of the title, Frankie and Johnny.

404
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:15,346
Well, at least the billing is right.

405
00:27:16,552 --> 00:27:18,395
Let's hear it, Stephen Foster.

406
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:23,692
Frankie and Johnny were lovers

407
00:27:24,101 --> 00:27:27,605
Oh, lordy, how they could love

408
00:27:28,438 --> 00:27:29,735
Just play it.

409
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:36,079
Frankie and Johnny were lovers

410
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:37,740
Time they got married.

411
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:41,952
Oh, lordy, how they could love

412
00:27:42,244 --> 00:27:43,461
Blabbermouth.

413
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:46,169
Swore to be true to each other

414
00:27:51,712 --> 00:27:54,716
This story has no moral

415
00:27:57,509 --> 00:28:00,558
This story has no end

416
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:06,689
This story only goes to show

417
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:11,073
That there ain't no good in men

418
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:15,406
They'll do you wrong

419
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:20,074
Yes, they'll do you wrong

420
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:28,298
Frankie and me, we are lovers

421
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:32,135
Oh, lordy, how we can love

422
00:28:33,337 --> 00:28:35,760
Swore to be true to each other

423
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:39,677
JUSt as true as stars above

424
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:42,187
Frankie, I'm your man

425
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:45,478
I'll never do you wrong

426
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:14,678
I knew that I was a winner

427
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:18,340
When a new gal caught my eye

428
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:22,060
But I couldn't two-time Frankie

429
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:26,015
For that chick named Nellie Bly

430
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:28,274
I'm Frankie's man

431
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:32,358
I wouldn't do her wrong

432
00:29:35,274 --> 00:29:37,948
Baby, leave me here to gamble

433
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:41,871
I'll be home before dawn

434
00:29:42,948 --> 00:29:45,201
Don't wait up for me, honey

435
00:29:45,701 --> 00:29:48,545
And don't you worry while I'm gone

436
00:29:48,829 --> 00:29:51,924
Johnny, you're my man

437
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:55,381
Now, don't you do me wrong

438
00:30:01,591 --> 00:30:04,265
Johnny, he wasn't too lucky

439
00:30:05,387 --> 00:30:07,810
He was a loser that night

440
00:30:09,683 --> 00:30:12,277
So he tried to change his luck

441
00:30:12,561 --> 00:30:15,280
With the gal who wasn't right

442
00:30:15,564 --> 00:30:18,943
He's Frankie's man

443
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:23,114
But he's doing her wrong

444
00:31:02,194 --> 00:31:05,573
Frankie, I don't wanna make you no trouble

445
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:09,914
Honey, I don't wanna tell you no lie

446
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:14,999
But I saw your sweetman Johnny

447
00:31:16,041 --> 00:31:20,137
He was messing around with that Nellie Bly

448
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:23,139
Well, if he's your man

449
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:27,310
Then he's doing you wrong

450
00:31:31,098 --> 00:31:33,851
Frankie went back to find Johnny

451
00:31:34,768 --> 00:31:37,317
She wasn't looking for fun

452
00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:42,075
In her sweet, dainty little hand

453
00:31:42,359 --> 00:31:45,283
She was toting a .44 gun

454
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:47,322
To shoot her man

455
00:31:48,824 --> 00:31:50,872
'Cause he was doing her wrong

456
00:31:54,204 --> 00:31:57,048
Frankie looked into the barroom

457
00:31:58,291 --> 00:32:00,760
Right there in front of her eye

458
00:32:02,129 --> 00:32:04,723
There was her sweetman Johnny

459
00:32:05,507 --> 00:32:08,135
Making love to that Nellie Bly

460
00:32:08,427 --> 00:32:11,522
He was her man

461
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:14,228
She caught him doing her wrong

462
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:15,934
Johnny!

463
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:22,198
Frankie, I beg you, don't shoot me

464
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:25,364
They'll put you away in a cell

465
00:32:26,445 --> 00:32:29,244
They'll put you where the cold wind blows

466
00:32:29,531 --> 00:32:33,627
From the hottest corner of hell

467
00:32:34,077 --> 00:32:37,672
Johnny, you're my man

468
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:45,465
But you're doing me wrong

469
00:33:07,027 --> 00:33:08,495
Mr. Wilbur...

470
00:33:11,907 --> 00:33:15,582
He was her man

471
00:33:16,036 --> 00:33:22,760
But he done her wrong

472
00:33:33,178 --> 00:33:34,680
Did I write a hit, Mr. Wilbur?

473
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:37,850
I'll be honest with you.
You know what's good about this song?

474
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:39,063
- The words?
-No.

475
00:33:39,351 --> 00:33:41,228
- The music?
-No. Them.

476
00:33:41,937 --> 00:33:43,735
You ought to be on Broadway.

477
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:49,611
- You didn't like the song?
-lt's fine for their act.

478
00:33:49,903 --> 00:33:51,951
I might even publish it. But a hit?

479
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:56,289
- I know one when I hear it.
-Well, you heard one tonight.

480
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:57,702
You're just saying you didn't

481
00:33:57,994 --> 00:33:59,746
because you don't want
to give us an advance.

482
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:03,042
- Shut up, sweetheart.
-No advance, no song.

483
00:34:03,792 --> 00:34:05,385
Back in the trunk it goes.

484
00:34:05,669 --> 00:34:08,468
Now look, nobody pushes
Joe Wilbur around. Forget it!

485
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:14,053
- How big an advance?
-Talk to my business manager.

486
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:17,389
Well, now, Mr. Wilbur,

487
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:20,980
-$300, and the song is yours.
-$100.

488
00:34:22,352 --> 00:34:25,606
Well, let'sjust split the difference,
shall we? $250.

489
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:28,650
Well, let's not quibble about it. $200 it is.

490
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:33,030
Mr. Wilbur, were you serious
about Frankie and me?

491
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:34,743
I've seen better, but not very often.

492
00:34:35,031 --> 00:34:37,204
-Isn't Johnny great?
-lsn't she wonderful?

493
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:41,122
All you need is some new costumes,
arrangements, and special material.

494
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:42,797
Here's my card.

495
00:34:44,541 --> 00:34:47,044
Look me up
when you get to New York. Goodbye.

496
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:48,962
Thank you, Mr. Wilbur.

497
00:34:49,462 --> 00:34:50,714
We're on our way!

498
00:34:51,006 --> 00:34:53,850
Goodbye, riverboat! Hello, Broadway!

499
00:34:57,137 --> 00:34:59,936
We never got discouraged

500
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:02,351
We never had a doubt

501
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:04,861
'Cause sooner or later

502
00:35:05,145 --> 00:35:07,648
Talent must win out

503
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:12,403
Look out, Broadway, we're coming fast

504
00:35:12,694 --> 00:35:16,574
Now we're gonna see
our names in lights at last

505
00:35:16,865 --> 00:35:20,460
No more hot dogs at Sloppy Joe's

506
00:35:20,744 --> 00:35:24,499
We're gonna dine on steak and wine
at Delmonico's

507
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:28,714
Rich or poor it's great to have dough

508
00:35:29,002 --> 00:35:32,427
That's one thing we know

509
00:35:32,714 --> 00:35:36,139
Lots of fun, lots of laughs

510
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:40,472
Signing checks and contracts
and autographs

511
00:35:40,764 --> 00:35:44,268
We're up for N-E-W Y-O-R-K

512
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:48,234
Look out, look out Broadway

513
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:51,908
I wanna see all the hustle and bustle

514
00:35:52,442 --> 00:35:55,742
Maybe I can get a date with Lillian Russell

515
00:35:56,321 --> 00:35:59,575
I wanna go out with Diamond Jim

516
00:35:59,866 --> 00:36:03,416
Yeah, if he gives you a diamond
what will you give to him?

517
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:07,795
Blow the trumpets and beat on the drums

518
00:36:08,083 --> 00:36:11,678
Big town here we come

519
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:15,636
No more cheap hotels and one-night stands

520
00:36:15,924 --> 00:36:19,519
We'll knock Tin Pan Alley flat on its pan

521
00:36:19,803 --> 00:36:23,649
They'll see that we've got class
with a capital “K“

522
00:36:23,932 --> 00:36:30,531
Look out, look out, Broadway

523
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:32,490
Look out

524
00:36:32,774 --> 00:36:35,823
Well, all we need is enough money
to get to New York.

525
00:36:36,111 --> 00:36:37,488
A lot more than $200.

526
00:36:37,779 --> 00:36:40,999
- Don't look at me.
-Okay, I'll win it in the casino.

527
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:43,159
How can I lose
with a beautiful redhead beside me?

528
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:45,499
- If you're thinking of Nellie...
-Nellie who?

529
00:36:45,787 --> 00:36:49,132
Just remember this,
if she's in, I'm out. Good night.

530
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:55,138
You would have hated New York, anyway.

531
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:57,052
We'll get there.

532
00:36:58,508 --> 00:37:01,102
Peg, our half.

533
00:37:03,513 --> 00:37:05,231
Frankie's half of our half.

534
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:08,568
Where's my half of our half?

535
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:12,063
Guess.

536
00:37:12,731 --> 00:37:14,779
What am I, a mammary expert?

537
00:37:21,156 --> 00:37:24,660
Got a brand-new rabbit's foot,
a horseshoe from a derby winner,

538
00:37:26,536 --> 00:37:28,755
the lucky cricket Frankie gave me.

539
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:33,252
Now all you need is a new lucky redhead,
and I know the perfect spot to find one.

540
00:37:38,882 --> 00:37:39,929
Blonde.

541
00:37:41,468 --> 00:37:42,685
Another blonde.

542
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:49,438
Brunette.

543
00:37:51,561 --> 00:37:52,778
Blonde.

544
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:01,863
Heaven only knows.

545
00:38:06,451 --> 00:38:07,623
Brunette.

546
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:15,548
Your guess is as good as mine.

547
00:38:16,586 --> 00:38:19,260
It looks like somebody
cornered the market on redheads.

548
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:20,924
Let's give it up for tonight.

549
00:38:21,216 --> 00:38:23,435
With this money burning a hole
in my pocket? No.

550
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:25,891
We could trap a blonde and dye her red.

551
00:38:26,638 --> 00:38:27,935
I'm waiting here for the real thing.

552
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:33,065
Jackpot.

553
00:38:36,481 --> 00:38:38,529
Watch the old master go to work.

554
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:44,657
- Hello, Eloise.
-Hello, Charlie.

555
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:49,206
Wait a minute. You're not Charlie.

556
00:38:49,494 --> 00:38:52,043
- You're Jack.
-That's right, Eloise.

557
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:56,126
Eloise? I thought you said Abigail.

558
00:38:56,668 --> 00:38:59,547
Pardon me, old master.
Are you alone, Abigail?

559
00:38:59,838 --> 00:39:03,934
Practically.
Boyfriend passed out about an hour ago.

560
00:39:04,217 --> 00:39:05,639
Can't hold his liquor.

561
00:39:05,927 --> 00:39:08,430
And he's letting
a lovely lady like you drift around

562
00:39:08,721 --> 00:39:10,189
by her little old lonesome?

563
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:13,443
Who's lonesome? I got you two.

564
00:39:21,276 --> 00:39:23,244
She is no gentleman.

565
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:30,794
- Here we go.
-Place your bets.

566
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:32,203
Here we go.

567
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:34,463
- What number do you like?
-Thirteen.

568
00:39:34,914 --> 00:39:35,881
Thirteen?

569
00:39:36,165 --> 00:39:40,671
That's my lucky number,
on account of I got 13 letters in my name.

570
00:39:40,962 --> 00:39:44,637
A-B-I-G-A-I-L.

571
00:39:45,008 --> 00:39:45,975
Thirteen.

572
00:39:46,259 --> 00:39:49,183
Lady, you could stand
a few lessons in arithmetic.

573
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:50,437
Does it have to be 13?

574
00:39:50,722 --> 00:39:53,726
If you don't bet 13, I'll cry.

575
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:57,645
No more bets.

576
00:40:08,948 --> 00:40:10,325
Thirteen, black!

577
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:14,003
You did it!

578
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:17,711
- What number do you like now?
-Thirteen. I like thirteen.

579
00:40:17,999 --> 00:40:20,252
- Again?
-Thirteen. Bet it all.

580
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:22,887
Let it ride on 13.

581
00:40:38,186 --> 00:40:39,187
Thirteen!

582
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:41,488
How about that?

583
00:40:42,774 --> 00:40:45,243
- That gypsy knew something.
-Didn't I tell you?

584
00:40:45,526 --> 00:40:47,324
Let it ride!

585
00:40:47,612 --> 00:40:49,034
- Bet it all.
-All of it?

586
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:51,245
You can't hit 13 three times in a row.

587
00:40:51,532 --> 00:40:54,206
Don't tell me
you're some kind of a cheapskate.

588
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:57,376
The lady said let it ride, okay?

589
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:01,842
The limit's off.

590
00:41:03,086 --> 00:41:05,965
- All of it goes on 13.
-No!

591
00:41:06,255 --> 00:41:07,256
On 31.

592
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:12,437
- Don't you mean 13?
-I don't like 13 anymore.

593
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,188
I am fickle.

594
00:41:15,723 --> 00:41:17,691
All right, all of it on 31.

595
00:41:22,271 --> 00:41:23,864
He could use a little help.

596
00:41:40,456 --> 00:41:42,254
The winner, 13!

597
00:41:54,429 --> 00:41:57,603
Abigail, don't just lie there. Say something.

598
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:00,568
Who moved the table?

599
00:42:18,745 --> 00:42:21,123
Frankie, did I wake you?

600
00:42:22,707 --> 00:42:24,129
It's pretty sad music.

601
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:29,263
Sad? It's a dirge. I almost won $5,000.

602
00:42:29,881 --> 00:42:31,224
$5,000?

603
00:42:31,883 --> 00:42:34,352
Why didn't you quit when you were ahead?

604
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:36,228
Ask me an easier question.

605
00:42:37,013 --> 00:42:38,686
All right, I will.

606
00:42:39,515 --> 00:42:45,147
Why do I have to love a riverboat singer
whose life is one great big roulette wheel?

607
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:47,652
Don't you ever win?

608
00:42:48,649 --> 00:42:51,653
That's two questions,
but I can only answer the second.

609
00:43:00,828 --> 00:43:04,799
I wave no magic wand

610
00:43:06,751 --> 00:43:10,346
I own no lucky charms

611
00:43:11,798 --> 00:43:15,848
How then can I explain

612
00:43:16,928 --> 00:43:20,853
An angel in my arms?

613
00:43:22,809 --> 00:43:26,029
Must be beginner's luck

614
00:43:28,064 --> 00:43:30,783
What else can it be?

615
00:43:32,193 --> 00:43:38,542
When someone wonderful as you loves me?

616
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:48,547
I wave no magic wand

617
00:43:50,128 --> 00:43:53,553
I own no lucky charms

618
00:43:55,508 --> 00:43:59,058
How then can I explain

619
00:44:00,138 --> 00:44:04,063
An angel in my arms?

620
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:09,405
Must be beginner's luck

621
00:44:11,357 --> 00:44:14,406
What else can it be?

622
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:22,252
When someone wonderful as you

623
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:27,753
loves me?

624
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:57,741
Aren't you going to rehearse?
We're only an hour from New Orleans.

625
00:44:58,029 --> 00:45:00,248
And less than 24 hours from being rich.

626
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:01,498
I'm dead broke.

627
00:45:01,782 --> 00:45:04,911
Peg went through my pants last night,
with me in them.

628
00:45:05,203 --> 00:45:07,376
- I don't need any money from you.
-You don't?

629
00:45:07,663 --> 00:45:09,415
No. I talked Braden into another advance.

630
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:12,335
- If I can talk Nellie into meeting...
-Nellie?

631
00:45:12,627 --> 00:45:14,379
She's the right redhead, Cully.
I can win with her.

632
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:16,343
You can get your head broken.

633
00:45:16,631 --> 00:45:19,510
Frankie and I belong in the big time.
You heard the man from Broadway.

634
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:22,849
I also heard Frankie tell you
to keep away from Nellie.

635
00:45:23,137 --> 00:45:27,108
Just one hot spin of the wheel is all I need,
with Nellie beside me.

636
00:45:27,767 --> 00:45:29,815
I'll come visit you in the hospital.

637
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:39,032
The song demands
Down by the riverside

638
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:43,200
Down by the riverside

639
00:45:43,491 --> 00:45:46,040
We'll hear them play and keep that beat

640
00:45:46,327 --> 00:45:47,874
Down by the riverside

641
00:45:48,162 --> 00:45:50,039
Down by the riverside

642
00:45:50,331 --> 00:45:51,924
Down by the riverside

643
00:45:52,208 --> 00:45:54,711
Let's get together what a treat

644
00:45:55,002 --> 00:45:56,595
Down by the riverside

645
00:45:56,879 --> 00:45:59,928
Down by the riverside

646
00:46:00,216 --> 00:46:03,686
Strike up the band, start the parade

647
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:08,065
Don't let that grand old rhythm fade

648
00:46:09,267 --> 00:46:12,897
Just play that drum, play that number

649
00:46:13,813 --> 00:46:17,317
When the saints come marching in

650
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:21,078
Shake tambourines, play that comet

651
00:46:22,196 --> 00:46:25,871
Crank up that horn you won't forget

652
00:46:26,951 --> 00:46:30,706
Your heart will hum to that number

653
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:35,130
When the saints come marching in

654
00:46:35,418 --> 00:46:39,048
The cymbals clang,just pound that beat

655
00:46:40,006 --> 00:46:43,601
Sounds like a hundred marching feet

656
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:48,436
It's fun to join in that number

657
00:46:49,056 --> 00:46:52,856
When the saints come marching in

658
00:46:53,144 --> 00:46:56,819
See banners wave, oh, hear that ring

659
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:01,320
We all feel prouder than a king

660
00:47:02,194 --> 00:47:06,449
'Cause everyone, everyone
loves that number

661
00:47:06,741 --> 00:47:10,462
When the saints come marching in

662
00:47:20,463 --> 00:47:22,841
I don't know about you, but I killed them.

663
00:47:24,008 --> 00:47:26,636
- New Orleans loves us.
-What's not to love?

664
00:47:26,927 --> 00:47:28,224
Meet you back at the colonial house.

665
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:31,140
Peg and I must pick out our costumes
for the Mardi Gras ball.

666
00:47:31,432 --> 00:47:34,356
- What are you going as?
-Lady Godiva. What else?

667
00:47:35,936 --> 00:47:37,313
Lady Godiva?

668
00:47:37,938 --> 00:47:41,613
- That sure ain't fair to New Orleans.
-Let's hope she gets a long wig.

669
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:05,925
You sure there'll be nobody
at the ball dressed like me?

670
00:48:06,217 --> 00:48:09,687
Madam, in my shop
we specialize in one-of-a-kind costumes.

671
00:48:12,264 --> 00:48:15,143
Let's face it, you're adorable.

672
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:17,653
How can any man resist you?

673
00:48:18,604 --> 00:48:21,232
My problem is just the other way around.

674
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:27,572
Allow me, my dear.

675
00:48:28,823 --> 00:48:29,870
Thank you.

676
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:39,629
Little Bo Peep has lost her sheep.

677
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:46,348
I don't blame them for running away.

678
00:48:48,926 --> 00:48:50,052
How do I look?

679
00:48:51,804 --> 00:48:55,479
Honey, if l were Louis XV,
I'd make you queen.

680
00:48:55,975 --> 00:48:57,693
I'll get our clothes.

681
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:02,402
Are you sure I'll be
the only Madame Pompadour at the ball?

682
00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:05,364
My dear young lady,
this is a one-of-a-kind costume

683
00:49:05,651 --> 00:49:07,699
that I personally imported from Paris.

684
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:12,867
Little Bo Peep is ready for action.

685
00:49:13,159 --> 00:49:14,035
Okay?

686
00:49:24,545 --> 00:49:25,467
Charming.

687
00:49:25,754 --> 00:49:28,382
What Madame Pompadour would've given
to look like you.

688
00:49:28,674 --> 00:49:30,893
Her head. Or was that Marie Antoinette?

689
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:33,808
Is this a good night
to go out with the wrong man

690
00:49:34,096 --> 00:49:36,815
so that the right man
will ask me to marry him?

691
00:49:37,099 --> 00:49:41,149
For that any night is the right night,
especially on Mardi Gras night.

692
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:49,240
Harry, give me a hand.

693
00:49:49,528 --> 00:49:52,122
We still have 10 more
Madame Pompadours to get rid of.

694
00:50:15,930 --> 00:50:17,022
Guess who?

695
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:22,316
- Nellie? I thought you changed your mind.
-Nellie? Why, Johnny, you...

696
00:50:22,603 --> 00:50:26,278
Frankie, I knew it was you all the time.
I was just trying to make you jealous.

697
00:50:27,942 --> 00:50:28,909
Convinced?

698
00:50:29,193 --> 00:50:32,618
That was a guilty kiss
if I ever had one, but let's go.

699
00:50:33,113 --> 00:50:34,160
Go where?

700
00:50:34,448 --> 00:50:37,543
You know Braden's holding open house
in Suite 309.

701
00:50:37,826 --> 00:50:40,500
- Come on.
-I promised to wait here for Cully.

702
00:50:41,288 --> 00:50:42,790
Cully and who else?

703
00:50:43,415 --> 00:50:44,962
Just Cully. I swear.

704
00:50:45,793 --> 00:50:47,261
The left hand?

705
00:50:48,462 --> 00:50:51,932
- All right. I'll meet you there. Suite 309.
-Frankie.

706
00:50:53,968 --> 00:50:56,847
Remember how to do that
after we get married.

707
00:51:02,768 --> 00:51:04,315
Well, it fooled her.

708
00:51:07,189 --> 00:51:10,489
- Watch it, I'm not getting any younger.
-You find Nellie yet?

709
00:51:10,776 --> 00:51:13,370
Braden set her up in Room 306.
She said to meet her there.

710
00:51:13,654 --> 00:51:15,156
Can't I talk you out of this, Johnny?

711
00:51:15,447 --> 00:51:18,121
Not a chance.
Go up in 309 and keep Frankie busy.

712
00:51:18,409 --> 00:51:19,456
I promised to do a number with the band.

713
00:51:27,001 --> 00:51:28,503
Last year's model.

714
00:51:31,589 --> 00:51:33,808
Everybody listen to me

715
00:51:34,508 --> 00:51:36,886
Put a smile on your face

716
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:40,314
There's no reason to be gloomy

717
00:51:41,098 --> 00:51:45,274
This world's a wonderful place

718
00:51:46,478 --> 00:51:50,358
So when I say again happy
Shout it out

719
00:51:50,649 --> 00:51:54,074
Yeah, get happy now
Shout it out

720
00:51:54,361 --> 00:51:57,956
Well, now, there is no doubt
you've got a lot to shout about

721
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:01,210
Give a yell life is swell
Shout it out

722
00:52:01,577 --> 00:52:05,047
While there's good food you can taste

723
00:52:05,331 --> 00:52:08,676
While there's music life's no waste

724
00:52:08,959 --> 00:52:12,304
While there's great things happening

725
00:52:12,588 --> 00:52:15,512
There's no end to the joy life can bring

726
00:52:15,799 --> 00:52:19,349
I said come on get happy
Shout it out

727
00:52:19,637 --> 00:52:23,358
Yeah, get happy now
Shout it out

728
00:52:23,641 --> 00:52:27,396
Well now there is no doubt
you've a lot to shout about

729
00:52:27,686 --> 00:52:30,610
Give a yell life is swell
Shout it out

730
00:52:30,898 --> 00:52:33,868
As long as there's someone you can love

731
00:52:34,652 --> 00:52:37,405
As long as bright stars shine above

732
00:52:37,988 --> 00:52:41,367
You've got no reason to be blue

733
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:45,045
Think what it means
when your dreams all come true

734
00:52:45,329 --> 00:52:48,879
I said come on get happy
Shout it out

735
00:52:49,166 --> 00:52:52,761
Yeah, get happy now
Shout it out

736
00:52:53,045 --> 00:52:56,720
Well, now, there is no doubt
you've a lot to shout about

737
00:52:57,007 --> 00:52:59,977
Give a yell life is swell
Shout it out

738
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:03,935
I said now there is no doubt
you've a lot to shout about

739
00:53:04,223 --> 00:53:07,477
Give a yell life is swell
Shout it out

740
00:53:08,227 --> 00:53:11,151
There is no doubt
you've a lot to shout about

741
00:53:11,438 --> 00:53:15,033
Give a yell life is swell
Shout it out

742
00:53:26,286 --> 00:53:28,630
Respect for Father Time.

743
00:53:30,332 --> 00:53:32,255
Frankie, where are you going?

744
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:35,638
Frankie? It's me, Mitzi.

745
00:53:37,923 --> 00:53:39,846
Nobody loves me.

746
00:53:40,134 --> 00:53:41,306
I love you.

747
00:53:41,885 --> 00:53:44,013
Did you know you were dressed
just like Frankie?

748
00:53:44,304 --> 00:53:46,102
That's why I'm leaving.

749
00:53:46,390 --> 00:53:50,691
I caught Braden kissing me
when he thought he was kissing Frankie.

750
00:53:52,271 --> 00:53:56,697
I hate Nellie,
but I'm going to tell her what's going on.

751
00:53:56,984 --> 00:53:58,031
Why tell her?

752
00:53:58,694 --> 00:54:02,073
I want her to be as miserable as I am.

753
00:54:06,368 --> 00:54:08,462
<i>Happy...</i>

754
00:54:09,496 --> 00:54:11,669
Whatever it is we're celebrating.

755
00:54:11,957 --> 00:54:14,176
- That calls for a kiss.
-Go away, old man.

756
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:16,758
Old man? It's me.

757
00:54:18,714 --> 00:54:20,387
Go away, old man.

758
00:54:22,384 --> 00:54:24,682
<i>Happy...</i>

759
00:54:31,769 --> 00:54:35,740
How about a kiss for the boss?
How about remembering I'm Johnny's girl?

760
00:54:36,023 --> 00:54:36,990
Johnny?

761
00:54:37,274 --> 00:54:39,572
Now, where do you suppose he is?

762
00:54:39,860 --> 00:54:41,737
Where do you suppose Nellie is?

763
00:54:42,029 --> 00:54:44,373
Hello, everyone. It's me, Cully.

764
00:54:44,656 --> 00:54:47,034
Did you know
that you and Mitzi are wearing...

765
00:54:47,326 --> 00:54:49,749
I thought you were meeting Johnny.
Where is he?

766
00:54:50,037 --> 00:54:51,289
Singing with the band.

767
00:54:51,580 --> 00:54:53,799
I never heard him sound better.
His vibrato...

768
00:54:54,082 --> 00:54:57,086
His vibrato had better not be
in Nellie's room.

769
00:54:57,377 --> 00:55:00,221
- Where is it?
-Right down the hall. 306.

770
00:55:01,089 --> 00:55:03,387
I'll let you know if we're both wrong.

771
00:55:05,677 --> 00:55:07,224
Hold it, pedal pusher.

772
00:55:08,722 --> 00:55:09,974
Where is Johnny, really?

773
00:55:10,265 --> 00:55:12,142
Not with Nellie,
if that's what you're thinking.

774
00:55:12,434 --> 00:55:14,812
- That's what he's thinking.
-Shut up, Blackie.

775
00:55:15,103 --> 00:55:16,275
I didn't open my mouth.

776
00:55:16,563 --> 00:55:20,238
Would Nellie two-time you? Would Johnny?
They'd be crazy.

777
00:55:22,194 --> 00:55:23,571
Fill it up, Blackie.

778
00:55:30,285 --> 00:55:32,913
Come in, Johnny. Be right with you.

779
00:55:36,667 --> 00:55:37,759
Get up!

780
00:55:38,919 --> 00:55:42,139
- Who are you?
-You know darn well who I am.

781
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:48,854
You'll never believe it,
but you and me and Nellie are triplets.

782
00:55:49,471 --> 00:55:50,438
Mitzi.

783
00:55:52,182 --> 00:55:53,934
What are you doing here?

784
00:55:55,686 --> 00:55:58,109
First you got to tell me where I am.

785
00:56:00,691 --> 00:56:02,864
As one Madame Pompadour to the other...

786
00:56:03,151 --> 00:56:05,654
Why did you say, “Come in, Johnny,"
when I knocked at the door?

787
00:56:06,029 --> 00:56:08,873
Because I was expecting him.
Any objection?

788
00:56:09,157 --> 00:56:12,661
If I start to pull your hair out,
I'm not going to stop at your wig.

789
00:56:12,953 --> 00:56:14,796
Johnny thinks I'm his lady luck.

790
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:17,458
Hejust wants me
to go to the casino with him.

791
00:56:17,749 --> 00:56:19,467
What else does he have in mind?

792
00:56:20,419 --> 00:56:25,767
That depends on how much he wins,
or how much I want to lose.

793
00:56:27,467 --> 00:56:30,220
Attention! I want attention, please.

794
00:56:30,721 --> 00:56:34,646
Wouldn't it be funny
if Johnny made love to me

795
00:56:35,142 --> 00:56:38,191
when he thought
he was making love to Nellie,

796
00:56:38,729 --> 00:56:41,073
only it turned out to be you?

797
00:56:43,901 --> 00:56:47,075
- She's not as dumb as she looks.
-$5 will get you $10.

798
00:56:47,362 --> 00:56:51,287
No, wait a minute. She has a great idea.
Put on your mask.

799
00:56:57,956 --> 00:56:59,708
What do you have in mind?

800
00:57:01,084 --> 00:57:02,552
A little masquerade.

801
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:06,799
But first, what's the real reason
you're going out with Johnny?

802
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:09,263
- To come between us?
-Of course not.

803
00:57:09,551 --> 00:57:13,397
To make Braden jealous.
Jealous enough to ask me to marry him.

804
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:16,854
- You really love him!
-As much as you love Johnny.

805
00:57:17,267 --> 00:57:20,237
Good. Now, let's hear you say,

806
00:57:21,104 --> 00:57:24,904
Johnny, do you suppose
I could come between you and Frankie?

807
00:57:25,484 --> 00:57:29,910
Johnny, do you suppose
I could come between you and Frankie?

808
00:57:30,656 --> 00:57:34,286
Johnny, do you suppose
I could come between you and Frankie?

809
00:57:34,576 --> 00:57:35,828
That's amazing!

810
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:39,214
- And convincing?
-You sound more like me than I do.

811
00:57:39,498 --> 00:57:40,499
Now walk.

812
00:57:45,253 --> 00:57:48,302
You've got to be born with that, but I'll try.

813
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:51,889
That's good.

814
00:57:58,100 --> 00:57:59,272
Nellie.

815
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:09,361
- Nellie.
-Come in, darling.

816
00:58:13,365 --> 00:58:15,618
- Sorry I'm late.
<i>-l'll</i> be with you in a minute.

817
00:58:15,909 --> 00:58:17,877
I have to get a handkerchief.

818
00:58:18,245 --> 00:58:21,089
Tonight's the night. I can feel it.

819
00:58:21,498 --> 00:58:22,966
That roulette wheel's gonna light up.

820
00:58:23,250 --> 00:58:25,969
So will Frankie if she finds out about us.

821
00:58:26,253 --> 00:58:27,470
She'd kill me.

822
00:58:27,963 --> 00:58:30,432
Yes, she would,just like in the song.

823
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:36,229
Ready or not, here I come.

824
00:58:36,930 --> 00:58:38,603
We'll live it up tonight.

825
00:58:43,603 --> 00:58:45,697
Now we're gonna prove
the gypsy was right.

826
00:58:45,981 --> 00:58:48,359
We'll do more than that, won't we?

827
00:58:49,776 --> 00:58:52,325
You're for me, Nellie. All the way.

828
00:58:56,033 --> 00:58:58,411
Nellie, where you going?

829
00:59:01,955 --> 00:59:04,834
Nobody talks to me anymore.

830
00:59:06,043 --> 00:59:08,796
I've been abandoned.

831
00:59:11,048 --> 00:59:12,971
But Johnny isn't with Nellie. I told you.

832
00:59:13,258 --> 00:59:15,010
Where is she?
Why didn't she come to my party?

833
00:59:15,302 --> 00:59:18,932
- Don't go bruising your knuckles, boss.
-I don't need any nursemaids.

834
00:59:23,435 --> 00:59:26,985
- Who's there? Identify yourself.
-Mitzi?

835
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:31,447
Come in, honey.

836
00:59:35,030 --> 00:59:37,533
What are you doing here? Where's Nellie?

837
00:59:38,116 --> 00:59:40,289
I'm here because I'm here.

838
00:59:40,577 --> 00:59:43,797
Alone, by the world forgot.

839
00:59:44,164 --> 00:59:46,041
I said, where's Nellie?

840
00:59:46,333 --> 00:59:49,212
Her? She went out with Johnny.

841
00:59:50,295 --> 00:59:52,093
I knew I was right.

842
00:59:53,090 --> 00:59:57,015
She's cheating on you.
He's cheating on Frankie.

843
00:59:58,929 --> 01:00:00,931
Why don't you cheat on somebody?

844
01:00:01,223 --> 01:00:02,725
I have been taken.

845
01:00:04,142 --> 01:00:05,519
I haven't.

846
01:00:07,312 --> 01:00:09,906
Two can play that little game.

847
01:00:10,190 --> 01:00:12,113
Two, like me and you?

848
01:00:12,609 --> 01:00:14,737
I just love games.

849
01:00:17,697 --> 01:00:18,949
Welcome home.

850
01:00:19,991 --> 01:00:22,244
Watch the wig. It's rented.

851
01:00:33,839 --> 01:00:36,388
- Who was that?
-Must have been Frankie.

852
01:00:36,758 --> 01:00:40,388
- What was she doing here?
-How should I know? It's not my room.

853
01:00:49,229 --> 01:00:51,948
- You worried about Braden?
-You worried about Frankie?

854
01:00:52,232 --> 01:00:55,031
What she doesn't know
won't hurt her, will it?

855
01:00:55,318 --> 01:00:57,662
Chips, please. And lucky ones.

856
01:00:58,655 --> 01:01:01,579
You stand right over here,
where you were before.

857
01:01:01,867 --> 01:01:05,542
That's it. Frankie's cricket for insurance.

858
01:01:06,454 --> 01:01:09,207
How can I lose? Got my lucky girl with me.

859
01:01:10,250 --> 01:01:13,629
- What number do you like?
-Two. Like in Frankie and you.

860
01:01:14,171 --> 01:01:15,548
Why not? It rhymes.

861
01:01:18,341 --> 01:01:19,763
Spin it real pretty.

862
01:01:31,897 --> 01:01:35,322
- A winner. Two, black.
-How about that?

863
01:01:35,817 --> 01:01:37,114
I can't miss with you.

864
01:01:37,402 --> 01:01:39,154
Pick another number,
and we'll walk out rich.

865
01:01:39,446 --> 01:01:41,790
How about playing your age? Five.

866
01:01:42,073 --> 01:01:44,952
- Five it is. Who wants to grow up?
-You're over the limit, sir.

867
01:01:45,243 --> 01:01:46,540
Then raise it.

868
01:01:49,039 --> 01:01:51,292
- The limit's off, sir.
-So is your hand.

869
01:01:51,583 --> 01:01:53,677
- My hand?
-Off the magnet button.

870
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:57,180
- Or shall I say it loud and clear?
-We run an honest wheel here, mister.

871
01:01:57,464 --> 01:01:59,307
The two of us will see to that.

872
01:01:59,674 --> 01:02:02,348
Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen.
Place your bets.

873
01:02:02,636 --> 01:02:03,979
Don't be chintzy. Bet it all.

874
01:02:04,429 --> 01:02:07,273
- On the five?
-And cover all the corners.

875
01:02:07,557 --> 01:02:10,936
- You really know the game, don't you?
-I used to go with a gambler.

876
01:02:11,228 --> 01:02:13,651
I'll surround that five so it can't get away.

877
01:02:16,816 --> 01:02:19,319
Broke again. But just for a minute.

878
01:02:29,246 --> 01:02:31,169
We run an honest game, remember?

879
01:02:41,132 --> 01:02:42,384
Five!

880
01:02:42,676 --> 01:02:45,020
- Winner, five.
-Cash me in, will you?

881
01:02:45,762 --> 01:02:47,560
$10,000. I'm a millionaire.

882
01:02:47,847 --> 01:02:49,690
- Didn't I tell you we'd do it?
-Yes, you did.

883
01:02:49,975 --> 01:02:51,227
It's me and you, Nellie.

884
01:02:51,518 --> 01:02:54,692
We'll break every casino they let us in.
Are you with me?

885
01:02:55,313 --> 01:02:56,360
Why not?

886
01:03:02,779 --> 01:03:05,328
It can't be. No two women kiss alike.

887
01:03:05,615 --> 01:03:06,867
It can't be is right.

888
01:03:07,158 --> 01:03:09,957
“From now on it's you and me, Nellie.
Are you with me?“

889
01:03:10,245 --> 01:03:12,498
Maybe she is, but I'm not!

890
01:03:14,624 --> 01:03:16,001
What happened?

891
01:03:16,293 --> 01:03:18,921
He won, and I lost.
And it's just the way I want it.

892
01:03:19,212 --> 01:03:21,590
- We're all washed up.
-I don't believe you.

893
01:03:21,881 --> 01:03:23,724
No? Have a ball.

894
01:03:24,592 --> 01:03:27,391
I might just be in the mood.

895
01:03:32,309 --> 01:03:36,155
- You sure murdered them tonight.
-Yeah. Right through the heart.

896
01:03:42,277 --> 01:03:43,779
Frankie, you came back.

897
01:03:54,581 --> 01:03:58,586
- Nellie! What are you doing here?
-Maybe the gypsy was right.

898
01:03:59,711 --> 01:04:01,805
Maybe we were meant for each other.

899
01:04:02,339 --> 01:04:03,431
Place your bet.

900
01:04:06,217 --> 01:04:08,720
Gee, it's great to be number one again.

901
01:04:09,471 --> 01:04:10,768
Hold the thought.

902
01:04:14,225 --> 01:04:16,774
What happened to your plan
to make Braden jealous?

903
01:04:17,062 --> 01:04:18,279
It backfired.

904
01:04:18,563 --> 01:04:22,238
He switched to Mitzi,
and so I'm switching to you.

905
01:04:22,692 --> 01:04:25,115
- I could do worse.
-I doubt it.

906
01:04:27,030 --> 01:04:30,079
You're still a loser, winner.

907
01:04:36,498 --> 01:04:38,717
I owe you seven weeks' salary plus...

908
01:05:02,899 --> 01:05:05,277
It was only champagne, honey.

909
01:05:06,945 --> 01:05:08,993
He's all yours, Mitzi,

910
01:05:09,864 --> 01:05:11,332
what's left of him.

911
01:05:15,495 --> 01:05:16,667
Back to 306?

912
01:05:16,955 --> 01:05:21,005
No. Back to Frankie if she'll have me,
gypsy or no sypsy.

913
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:25,638
Alone at last.

914
01:05:29,551 --> 01:05:32,555
Okay. So I got the money for Broadway.
So what?

915
01:05:32,846 --> 01:05:35,019
You're sure Frankie walked out on you?

916
01:05:35,598 --> 01:05:38,147
I can still feel her farewell message.

917
01:05:39,769 --> 01:05:42,363
- Sorry to interrupt the party.
-Frankie.

918
01:05:43,523 --> 01:05:44,524
Look.

919
01:05:45,358 --> 01:05:48,988
Look. This is our big-time bankroll.
We got it made.

920
01:05:49,279 --> 01:05:51,577
- We?
- Sure. The gypsy was wrong.

921
01:05:51,865 --> 01:05:54,209
I don't need a redhead. I need you.

922
01:05:54,742 --> 01:05:55,994
You're my lady luck.

923
01:05:56,870 --> 01:05:58,122
You're the family banker.

924
01:05:58,746 --> 01:06:01,465
You know what I think of this money,
or any gambling money?

925
01:06:02,125 --> 01:06:03,342
I'll show you.

926
01:06:05,545 --> 01:06:06,717
You wouldn't.

927
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:11,767
You would.

928
01:06:21,019 --> 01:06:23,397
- Money!
-$50 bills!

929
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:37,460
Lady, you won't believe it,
but some nut's throwing his money away.

930
01:06:37,744 --> 01:06:39,087
I believe it.

931
01:06:40,788 --> 01:06:42,586
Giddap. Come on.

932
01:06:46,544 --> 01:06:49,639
- How disgusting.
-Money! It came out of the clouds!

933
01:06:49,923 --> 01:06:52,472
Money! Let me in there!

934
01:06:52,759 --> 01:06:55,603
Get out of my way!
Out of my way! Let me in there!

935
01:07:01,184 --> 01:07:02,902
Folks.

936
01:07:04,187 --> 01:07:07,361
- The money that flew out of the window...
-What money?

937
01:07:07,649 --> 01:07:09,447
The money from the window.
I accidentally dropped it.

938
01:07:09,734 --> 01:07:11,611
I didn't see any money. Did you?

939
01:07:15,281 --> 01:07:17,283
I don't guess you did, did you?

940
01:07:29,045 --> 01:07:32,390
Hey, kid. Did you see the money
fly out of the window up there?

941
01:07:32,674 --> 01:07:34,347
No, sir. I didn't see any money.

942
01:07:34,634 --> 01:07:35,635
Okay.

943
01:07:36,886 --> 01:07:38,604
Got change of $50, mister?

944
01:07:39,305 --> 01:07:40,682
No. I ain't got change for $1.

945
01:07:54,070 --> 01:07:56,823
I'm really feeling mighty low

946
01:08:01,744 --> 01:08:03,997
No, no, no

947
01:08:04,497 --> 01:08:07,341
I got no place that I can go

948
01:08:10,712 --> 01:08:15,639
Sol got some blues to sing and

949
01:08:16,426 --> 01:08:18,599
So much remembering

950
01:08:25,435 --> 01:08:29,440
Black cats, keep away from me

951
01:08:31,024 --> 01:08:32,526
Take my advice

952
01:08:33,735 --> 01:08:35,237
Go shinny up a tree

953
01:08:35,528 --> 01:08:38,828
I've got hard luck

954
01:08:39,115 --> 01:08:43,541
The hardest kind of luck you'll find

955
01:08:44,287 --> 01:08:46,540
I ain't lying

956
01:08:47,332 --> 01:08:50,757
I've got the bluest kind of blues

957
01:08:51,044 --> 01:08:55,049
Driving me right out of my mind

958
01:09:00,970 --> 01:09:02,313
She's gone

959
01:09:03,598 --> 01:09:05,020
Said toodle-oo

960
01:09:06,559 --> 01:09:10,530
Kissed her goodbye and my-my
my money too

961
01:09:10,813 --> 01:09:14,192
I've got hard luck

962
01:09:14,484 --> 01:09:18,330
The hardest kind of luck you've seen

963
01:09:19,656 --> 01:09:21,704
I mean

964
01:09:22,659 --> 01:09:25,503
The way I'm running lately

965
01:09:26,204 --> 01:09:29,674
My lucky number is 13

966
01:09:35,171 --> 01:09:37,139
Where do I belong?

967
01:09:37,632 --> 01:09:42,263
Everything I do is wrong, all wrong

968
01:09:42,762 --> 01:09:44,856
Wrong as can be

969
01:09:46,307 --> 01:09:48,810
Who's stacking all the decks

970
01:09:49,143 --> 01:09:53,740
Lady Luck has got the hex on me

971
01:09:54,107 --> 01:09:56,860
Permanently

972
01:09:58,528 --> 01:09:59,654
Shove off

973
01:10:01,030 --> 01:10:02,623
Oh, I'm warning you

974
01:10:04,075 --> 01:10:05,998
This thing I caught, you know

975
01:10:06,619 --> 01:10:08,166
Could be catching too

976
01:10:08,454 --> 01:10:11,458
I've got hard luck

977
01:10:11,999 --> 01:10:15,720
The hardest kind of luck there can be

978
01:10:17,046 --> 01:10:18,923
Yes, siree

979
01:10:20,925 --> 01:10:24,145
I guess hard luck always chooses

980
01:10:24,887 --> 01:10:30,314
Natural born losers like me

981
01:10:54,751 --> 01:10:57,004
How long have we been drinking?

982
01:10:57,420 --> 01:10:58,967
Since last night.

983
01:11:00,631 --> 01:11:01,757
How's your head,

984
01:11:02,341 --> 01:11:05,094
the one I opened the champagne bottle on?

985
01:11:06,262 --> 01:11:08,060
You really launched me.

986
01:11:08,890 --> 01:11:11,063
But you did knock some sense into it.

987
01:11:11,976 --> 01:11:15,071
You found out
that it's really me that you go for?

988
01:11:15,354 --> 01:11:17,072
No. It's Nellie.

989
01:11:18,816 --> 01:11:21,695
But Nellie went “Bly-Bly.“

990
01:11:25,698 --> 01:11:28,201
How could she run out on me

991
01:11:29,285 --> 01:11:31,083
with Johnny Nothing?

992
01:11:32,914 --> 01:11:36,214
Women. Whoever invented them?

993
01:11:38,127 --> 01:11:39,174
Come in.

994
01:11:41,881 --> 01:11:44,851
- Did you find them?
-Couldn't find them anywhere, boss.

995
01:11:45,134 --> 01:11:46,761
I turned New Orleans upside down.

996
01:11:47,678 --> 01:11:49,521
How does it look that way?

997
01:11:50,848 --> 01:11:53,772
You want me to throw her out?
It's no bother.

998
01:11:54,060 --> 01:11:56,154
Two more drinks, and she'll float out.

999
01:11:56,854 --> 01:11:59,698
Looks like no Johnny, no Frankie,

1000
01:12:00,983 --> 01:12:02,280
no Nellie.

1001
01:12:02,902 --> 01:12:04,745
But you've still got me.

1002
01:12:05,363 --> 01:12:09,243
Charming, lovable, talented Mitzi.

1003
01:12:10,201 --> 01:12:11,919
The girl with a past

1004
01:12:13,496 --> 01:12:15,089
and no future.

1005
01:12:17,667 --> 01:12:20,170
Maybe you should've done
what my father did to my mother.

1006
01:12:20,670 --> 01:12:22,547
- What was that?
-Marry her.

1007
01:12:22,839 --> 01:12:24,762
You should've married Nellie Bly.

1008
01:12:26,133 --> 01:12:27,305
Maybe.

1009
01:12:27,593 --> 01:12:30,938
But I hated to spoil
such a beautiful friendship.

1010
01:12:32,139 --> 01:12:33,766
What a world.

1011
01:12:34,141 --> 01:12:35,768
Everybody's split up.

1012
01:12:36,727 --> 01:12:39,776
You and Nellie, Frankie and Johnny,

1013
01:12:40,273 --> 01:12:41,695
me and

1014
01:12:42,733 --> 01:12:44,656
anybody-

1015
01:12:57,582 --> 01:13:00,506
If anybody cares, I'm back, I'm sorry.

1016
01:13:02,044 --> 01:13:03,466
Nobody cares.

1017
01:13:08,134 --> 01:13:10,182
Please don't stop

1018
01:13:12,430 --> 01:13:14,478
Loving me

1019
01:13:16,475 --> 01:13:18,944
You were born

1020
01:13:20,396 --> 01:13:22,990
Just to be

1021
01:13:24,483 --> 01:13:26,827
In my arms

1022
01:13:28,571 --> 01:13:30,915
In my arms

1023
01:13:32,533 --> 01:13:34,581
Please don't stop

1024
01:13:36,829 --> 01:13:38,957
Loving me

1025
01:13:40,833 --> 01:13:43,211
Your lips were made

1026
01:13:44,879 --> 01:13:47,473
Just to be

1027
01:13:48,925 --> 01:13:52,020
Kissed by me

1028
01:13:53,012 --> 01:13:56,357
Kissed by me

1029
01:13:59,226 --> 01:14:01,354
When I'm with you

1030
01:14:03,314 --> 01:14:05,408
I don't know

1031
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:09,909
Day from night

1032
01:14:11,447 --> 01:14:13,916
Wrong from right

1033
01:14:15,451 --> 01:14:17,294
You're my world

1034
01:14:19,288 --> 01:14:21,040
That's all I know

1035
01:14:21,832 --> 01:14:24,551
I love you so

1036
01:14:25,544 --> 01:14:28,388
I won't let go

1037
01:14:29,340 --> 01:14:31,058
Please don't stop

1038
01:14:33,594 --> 01:14:35,471
Loving me

1039
01:14:37,640 --> 01:14:39,768
Darling you'll

1040
01:14:41,727 --> 01:14:43,946
Always be

1041
01:14:45,856 --> 01:14:48,450
Mine alone

1042
01:14:49,986 --> 01:14:55,914
Mine alone

1043
01:15:08,963 --> 01:15:10,761
- Who is it?
-Frankie.

1044
01:15:13,134 --> 01:15:15,853
I'm sorry Johnny and I missed
the show last night, Mr. Braden.

1045
01:15:16,137 --> 01:15:17,434
What about tonight?

1046
01:15:17,722 --> 01:15:19,850
You still got the show
for a couple of months.

1047
01:15:20,141 --> 01:15:23,520
- Only because you paid Johnny in advance.
-Can I count on two months?

1048
01:15:24,061 --> 01:15:27,440
If I don't shoot him for real
in the Frankie and Johnny number.

1049
01:15:28,274 --> 01:15:29,901
There's a thought.

1050
01:15:32,028 --> 01:15:34,156
Come on, Mitzi. We got an act to do.

1051
01:15:36,490 --> 01:15:39,460
I love him. He loves Nellie.

1052
01:15:40,244 --> 01:15:42,667
There never should've been two sexes.

1053
01:15:42,955 --> 01:15:43,956
Never.

1054
01:15:54,967 --> 01:15:56,184
Hey, boss.

1055
01:15:56,469 --> 01:15:58,722
Wouldn't it be nice
if Frankie shot Johnny like she said?

1056
01:15:59,889 --> 01:16:01,266
No such luck.

1057
01:16:15,905 --> 01:16:18,579
No. I've got enough nerve now.

1058
01:16:20,576 --> 01:16:22,078
Before I do it,

1059
01:16:23,579 --> 01:16:25,832
would you tell me something, Pete?

1060
01:16:26,123 --> 01:16:30,344
- Before you do what?
-Can a gal get away with shooting her guy?

1061
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:34,390
- What girl? What guy?
-You don't follow too good.

1062
01:16:34,673 --> 01:16:37,722
Now, look. This is him.

1063
01:16:38,969 --> 01:16:40,687
This is her.

1064
01:16:41,430 --> 01:16:43,683
Her shoots him

1065
01:16:44,475 --> 01:16:47,649
for two-timing her with her.

1066
01:16:48,395 --> 01:16:51,524
Now, does her get away with it,

1067
01:16:52,358 --> 01:16:54,110
or does her

1068
01:16:54,777 --> 01:16:56,199
get it in the neck?

1069
01:17:00,116 --> 01:17:02,960
I'd say not guilty,
but, of course, I ain't no judge.

1070
01:17:03,244 --> 01:17:06,248
Thanks, Pete. You're a real pal.

1071
01:17:10,042 --> 01:17:12,921
Do you think a girl
should believe a man like Johnny?

1072
01:17:13,212 --> 01:17:16,512
No woman should ever believe any man,
but we always do.

1073
01:17:17,258 --> 01:17:19,727
- Are you ready to forgive him?
-Not a chance.

1074
01:17:20,928 --> 01:17:23,727
- Frankie, honey.
-Yes, Johnny dear?

1075
01:17:24,932 --> 01:17:29,403
Remember now, in a situation like this,
always do the honest thing, lie.

1076
01:17:30,646 --> 01:17:34,947
-It's me, the reformed gambler.
-Come in, reformed gambler.

1077
01:17:38,070 --> 01:17:39,697
She's playing hard to get.

1078
01:17:39,989 --> 01:17:41,081
You missed me.

1079
01:17:43,159 --> 01:17:44,411
Kid's got a great arm.

1080
01:17:49,999 --> 01:17:51,125
Eddie.

1081
01:17:52,501 --> 01:17:54,970
Do you think a girl
could get away with murder

1082
01:17:55,254 --> 01:17:58,474
just because she's beautiful
and got nice legs?

1083
01:17:58,757 --> 01:18:00,851
Not if l was on the jury.

1084
01:18:02,178 --> 01:18:04,397
She'd have to have a nice figure, too.

1085
01:18:07,308 --> 01:18:09,606
Like Frankie's. Is that what you mean?

1086
01:18:09,894 --> 01:18:13,148
If my wife had a face and legs
and a figure like Frankie,

1087
01:18:13,439 --> 01:18:15,316
I'd give up work and stay home.

1088
01:18:45,471 --> 01:18:48,475
Frankie says
you've been hitting the bottle over me.

1089
01:18:50,142 --> 01:18:51,689
Was she telling the truth?

1090
01:18:51,977 --> 01:18:56,232
Nellie, you are just in time.

1091
01:18:56,523 --> 01:18:58,321
Just in time for what?

1092
01:18:58,734 --> 01:19:01,237
I want to propose a merger.

1093
01:19:01,779 --> 01:19:06,285
A merger like two companies,
or a merger like two people?

1094
01:19:06,700 --> 01:19:08,498
A merger like marriage.

1095
01:19:11,580 --> 01:19:12,832
How about it?

1096
01:19:14,375 --> 01:19:16,173
Ask me again after the show.

1097
01:19:24,385 --> 01:19:28,015
I want to play hard to get for a change.

1098
01:19:52,788 --> 01:19:54,506
I forgot Frankie's gun.

1099
01:20:03,257 --> 01:20:05,885
All right, folks. Here we go. On-stage.

1100
01:20:08,387 --> 01:20:09,809
Frankie, you got to forgive me.

1101
01:20:10,097 --> 01:20:12,395
- Why?
-Because Johnny loves Frankie.

1102
01:20:12,683 --> 01:20:14,651
I'll tell her if l see her.

1103
01:20:24,778 --> 01:20:27,622
This story has no moral

1104
01:20:30,492 --> 01:20:33,496
This story has no end

1105
01:20:36,623 --> 01:20:40,093
This story only goes to show

1106
01:20:40,377 --> 01:20:44,132
That there ain't no good in men

1107
01:20:44,423 --> 01:20:48,473
They'll do you wrong

1108
01:20:49,178 --> 01:20:52,978
Yes, they'll do you wrong

1109
01:20:58,771 --> 01:21:01,399
Frankie and me, we are lovers

1110
01:21:02,524 --> 01:21:04,902
Oh, lordy, how we can love

1111
01:21:06,362 --> 01:21:08,706
Swore to be true to each other

1112
01:21:09,573 --> 01:21:12,702
JUSt as true as stars above

1113
01:21:12,993 --> 01:21:14,745
Frankie, I'm your man

1114
01:21:16,246 --> 01:21:18,044
I'll never do you wrong

1115
01:21:21,668 --> 01:21:24,296
Johnny, he wasn't too lucky

1116
01:21:25,381 --> 01:21:27,850
He was a loser that night

1117
01:21:29,718 --> 01:21:32,562
So he tried to change his luck

1118
01:21:32,846 --> 01:21:35,269
With a gal who wasn't right

1119
01:21:35,557 --> 01:21:38,777
He's Frankie's man

1120
01:21:39,269 --> 01:21:43,024
But he's doing her wrong

1121
01:22:08,257 --> 01:22:11,807
Frankie, I don't wanna make you no trouble

1122
01:22:13,178 --> 01:22:16,478
Honey, I don't wanna tell you no lie

1123
01:22:16,765 --> 01:22:21,566
But I saw your sweetman Johnny

1124
01:22:21,979 --> 01:22:25,984
He was messing around with that Nellie Bly

1125
01:22:26,442 --> 01:22:28,865
Well, if he's your man

1126
01:22:30,612 --> 01:22:32,865
Then he's doing you wrong

1127
01:22:37,119 --> 01:22:39,588
Frankie went back to find Johnny

1128
01:22:40,956 --> 01:22:43,459
She wasn't looking for fun

1129
01:22:45,294 --> 01:22:48,138
In her sweet, dainty little hand

1130
01:22:48,422 --> 01:22:51,141
She was toting a .44 gun

1131
01:22:51,633 --> 01:22:53,180
To shoot her man

1132
01:22:54,970 --> 01:22:56,938
'Cause he was doing her wrong

1133
01:23:06,523 --> 01:23:09,823
Blackie, who do you know
who can marry us right away?

1134
01:23:10,360 --> 01:23:12,909
- You and who?
-Nellie and me.

1135
01:23:13,197 --> 01:23:15,575
Johnny Nothing
was really nothing in her life.

1136
01:23:15,866 --> 01:23:17,083
How about that?

1137
01:23:17,367 --> 01:23:20,166
Boss, things are working out just like you...

1138
01:23:22,456 --> 01:23:23,548
What's wrong?

1139
01:23:23,832 --> 01:23:26,711
I was only doing what I thought
you wanted me to do.

1140
01:23:27,002 --> 01:23:30,006
- You know, I was only...
-What are you trying to say?

1141
01:23:31,173 --> 01:23:35,098
You know the blank cartridge
Frankie shoots Johnny with?

1142
01:23:35,511 --> 01:23:36,728
What about it?

1143
01:23:38,347 --> 01:23:41,567
It ain't blank. I put in a real bullet.

1144
01:23:42,226 --> 01:23:44,649
Frankie is gonna shoot Johnny dead.

1145
01:23:45,521 --> 01:23:46,818
<i>You stupid...</i>

1146
01:23:49,525 --> 01:23:50,492
Sorry.

1147
01:23:50,776 --> 01:23:52,449
What's the matter with him?

1148
01:23:55,572 --> 01:23:57,916
She caught him doing her wrong

1149
01:23:59,117 --> 01:24:00,164
Johnny!

1150
01:24:03,205 --> 01:24:05,549
Frankie, I beg you don't shoot me

1151
01:24:06,542 --> 01:24:09,011
They'll put you away in a cell

1152
01:24:10,212 --> 01:24:12,886
They'll put you where the cold wind blows

1153
01:24:13,173 --> 01:24:17,269
From the hottest corner of hell

1154
01:24:17,553 --> 01:24:21,228
Johnny, you're my man

1155
01:24:23,725 --> 01:24:28,856
But you're doing me wrong

1156
01:24:41,743 --> 01:24:43,120
Don't shoot!

1157
01:24:43,662 --> 01:24:44,629
Close the curtain!

1158
01:24:44,913 --> 01:24:47,416
Close the curtain? What for?
What's the matter, Mr. Braden?

1159
01:24:47,708 --> 01:24:50,006
- What's happened?
-That was a real bullet.

1160
01:24:56,758 --> 01:25:00,604
Johnny, don't die. Please don't die.
I love you.

1161
01:25:01,096 --> 01:25:03,190
You can gamble all you want.

1162
01:25:04,725 --> 01:25:08,650
- You really mean that?
-I want you any way you are.

1163
01:25:09,980 --> 01:25:11,527
Baby, you got me.

1164
01:25:14,985 --> 01:25:17,204
But that gun was really loaded.

1165
01:25:18,071 --> 01:25:19,573
I did feel something.

1166
01:25:22,492 --> 01:25:26,042
It looks like a bullet dent.
But who put the bullet in the gun?

1167
01:25:26,663 --> 01:25:29,337
Let's just say, a misguided friend.

1168
01:25:35,005 --> 01:25:38,134
I'm asking again,
do you want to get married?

1169
01:25:39,635 --> 01:25:41,387
What have I got to lose?

1170
01:25:43,555 --> 01:25:46,354
I think I'll give him the air.

1171
01:25:57,611 --> 01:26:00,615
Everybody come aboard
the showboat tonight

1172
01:26:00,906 --> 01:26:03,125
We're gonna dance till the morning light

1173
01:26:03,408 --> 01:26:05,160
We'll have fun the whole night long

1174
01:26:05,452 --> 01:26:07,500
There'll be jokes and song

1175
01:26:08,163 --> 01:26:10,632
Forget your troubles, forget your strife

1176
01:26:10,916 --> 01:26:13,385
You'll have the best time of your life

1177
01:26:13,752 --> 01:26:17,632
Hey, everyone, let's go, on with the show

1178
01:26:18,006 --> 01:26:20,259
We're down by the levee

1179
01:26:20,550 --> 01:26:22,097
Showboat's at the bank

1180
01:26:22,969 --> 01:26:24,141
Bring money to spend

1181
01:26:24,429 --> 01:26:25,521
You're welcome, my friend

1182
01:26:25,806 --> 01:26:27,479
Just walk up the plank

1183
01:26:28,100 --> 01:26:30,979
Everybody come aboard
the showboat tonight

1184
01:26:31,269 --> 01:26:33,488
Look around at the happy sight

1185
01:26:33,772 --> 01:26:35,524
We'll guarantee that you'll have a ball

1186
01:26:35,816 --> 01:26:37,238
Come on, one and all

1187
01:26:38,151 --> 01:26:40,870
What a great night you've got in store

1188
01:26:41,196 --> 01:26:43,665
You wanna keep coming back for more

1189
01:26:44,032 --> 01:26:47,878
Hey, everyone, let's go, on with the show

1190
01:26:48,578 --> 01:26:50,922
What a great night you've got in store

1191
01:26:51,206 --> 01:26:54,050
I bet you wanna keep coming back for more

1192
01:26:54,334 --> 01:27:00,012
Hey, everyone, let's go, on with the show
