1
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:34,100
A VERY LONG ENGAGEMENT

2
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:03,400
Saturday the 6th of January, 1917,

3
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:07,500
five condemned soldiers
were escorted to Bouchavesnes

4
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,500
at the Front in the Somme.

5
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,300
Watch out for the wire!

6
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:42,500
The first,
once cheerful and adventurous,

7
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,400
wore the tag number 2124.
He was drafted from the Seine area.

8
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:51,400
On his feet were boots,
taken from a dead German.

9
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:55,200
Before becoming 2124,
he was known as Bastoche

10
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,400
and was hooked on a pretty redhead,

11
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,900
a certain Véronique Passavant.

12
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,900
He was a carpenter.

13
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,300
Taking a break from his woodwork,
they'd go for a beer

14
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,100
at Little Louis' bar,
in Golden Hand St.

15
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,100
He'd taken his boots from an enemy
who no longer needed them.

16
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:30,200
Stuffed with straw or newspaper,

17
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,700
they replaced his old clodhoppers.

18
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:47,700
He was court-martialed
for self-mutilation.

19
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,200
Gunpowder had been found
on his wounded hand.

20
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,500
He faced the death sentence.

21
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,900
Watch out for the wire!

22
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:16,500
The second soldier
was tag number 4077,

23
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,500
also from near the Seine.

24
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,500
He was a welder
for the State Railways, in Bagneux.

25
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,900
His name was Francis Gaignard,

26
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,000
nicknamed Six-Sous.

27
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:32,300
He knew the poor build the canons
of their own destruction,

28
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,600
but it's the rich who sell them.

29
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,300
He tried to explain it to the troops,

30
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,500
but he wasn't a good speaker.

31
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,800
And cheap wine,
poverty's best friend,

32
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:45,200
deadened the soldiers' eyes,

33
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:48,000
making it difficult
to get through to them.

34
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:35,600
Number 1818 was surely the bravest
and the toughest of them all.

35
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,500
He had once
killed a fellow officer...

36
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,200
an officer who kicked the dead.

37
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,300
Get up!

38
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,500
You swines!

39
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,300
You lazy cowards!

40
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,700
You! Get up!

41
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,100
Attack! Attack!

42
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,700
You! Get going!

43
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,100
No one ever found out.

44
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,400
Benoît Notre Dame was a farmer
from Dordogne.

45
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,100
One August morning,

46
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,600
they came to get him at his farm

47
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,600
and sent him off on a train.

48
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,700
Watch out for the wire!

49
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,600
The telephone wire is the only link
to the land of the living.

50
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,600
A flimsy wire, their only chance
for President Poincaré's pardon.

51
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:13,100
Even if the only one
to still believe in it

52
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:17,900
is him.
Number 7328, recruited in Corsica.

53
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,900
Angel Bassignano.

54
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,800
According to all who'd known him,

55
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,400
he was no angel at all.

56
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:30,300
He was a liar, a cheat, a show-off,

57
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,500
a sneak and a troublemaker.

58
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,200
Before all this,

59
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,500
Tina Lombardi worked as his whore.

60
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,900
He'd received a 5-year sentence for
an affair of either love or honour,

61
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:56,000
depending on who he was talking to.

62
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:59,800
It was, in fact, a conflict
between village pimps.

63
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,900
Summer 1916,
common-law criminals were enlisted

64
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:13,300
to beef up regiments
melted in the fires at Verdun.

65
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,700
They gave him the choice.

66
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,800
It's been shitting shells
round here!

67
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,400
No, it's been rather quiet.

68
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,200
Who are those for?

69
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,700
Well, actually...
you'll be attacking tomorrow.

70
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,200
We're getting a head start.

71
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,800
Watch out for the wire!

72
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:03,400
The fifth was a "Cornflower",
the nickname for the class of '17.

73
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:05,900
He was five months shy of 20.

74
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,900
These days, everything scared him.

75
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,900
French canons short-firing,

76
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:16,400
the wind that heralded
the mustard gas attacks,

77
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,700
executions to set an example.

78
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,300
He hadn't been like that before,

79
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,700
quite the opposite,

80
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,800
braving storms as he helped
lighthouse keepers.

81
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:59,100
And then came one shell too many.

82
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:03,500
There you go... The winning ticket
back to your fiancée.

83
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,300
The ticket for a court-martial.

84
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:08,700
Turn a blind eye, Sarge.
He's been through enough.

85
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,100
They could execute him.

86
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,000
- Be human for once.
- Shut up!

87
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,300
Please, Sarge!

88
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,300
Shut up!

89
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,500
The first time
Mathilde and Manech made love,

90
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,700
he fell asleep,
his hand on her breast.

91
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,800
Each time his wound throbs,

92
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,800
Manech feels Mathilde's heart
in his palm.

93
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:56,400
Each beat brings her closer to him.

94
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,600
If Manech were dead,
Mathilde would know.

95
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,900
Since the death notice,

96
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:11,100
she stubbornly holds on to her
intuition, like to a flimsy wire.

97
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,900
She never gets discouraged.

98
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:18,500
And Mathilde
is of a cheerful disposition.

99
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,400
If that wire doesn't lead her
to her lover, never mind...

100
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,900
she can always use it as a noose.

101
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:31,900
In June 1920, Mathilde received
a letter from a nun.

102
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:39,200
A patient at the Rennes hospital
wants to see her.

103
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:44,700
He'd met Manech in January '17
at the Front in the Somme.

104
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,300
August 1912.

105
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,700
Handsome, wasn't I?

106
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,400
It's a De Dion,

107
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,700
with direct drive.

108
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,700
Please, tell me about Manech.

109
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,100
In January '17,

110
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,700
I escorted five condemned soldiers.

111
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,100
He was one of them...

112
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,100
Yes.

113
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,500
I was to take them
to a front-line trench.

114
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:27,300
Gendarmes were waiting
with the prisoners

115
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:29,700
near a bombed-out cemetery.

116
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,900
What are you doing
with those German boots?

117
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,000
Waiting.

118
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,300
What for?

119
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,700
Poincaré's pardon? You'll wait!

120
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,400
He'll sign it!

121
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,000
I shouldn't
even have been condemned.

122
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,800
I'm Corsican, not French!

123
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,600
Leave him be.

124
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,100
He's lost it,
but that's for the best.

125
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,800
Finished, Lieutenant?

126
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,100
The cold has saved that one.

127
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,700
Gangrene would've got him
in summer.

128
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,700
And Manech?

129
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,700
Was he in pain?

130
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:33,800
They had to cut off two fingers,

131
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,700
but he wasn't suffering anymore.

132
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,300
I led them to a trench,

133
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,600
called "Bingo Crépuscule".

134
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,500
Bloody hell!

135
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,100
Couldn't you have lost them
on your way?

136
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:04,600
A kick in the ass
to get rid of them!

137
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,700
My orders
are to bring you these five.

138
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,400
And I'll tell you my orders!

139
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:12,600
I'm to throw these guys over the top

140
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,800
and leave them to die like dogs

141
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,900
between our line and the Jerries'!

142
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,500
Those are my damned orders,
Sergeant!

143
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:24,900
You see, Sergeant, with the Jerries,

144
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,500
It's a little too calm?
Let's start the fireworks

145
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,400
and watch all hell let loose!

146
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,500
Soup, guys!
You're lucky, it's still warm.

147
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,400
Beetroot and fennel.

148
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,000
What can I get for you?

149
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:50,400
A large hot chocolate
and some bread with honey.

150
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,300
I'd kill my parents to get you that!

151
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,700
Do you mind, Lieutenant?

152
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,700
He's an orphan!

153
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:02,700
He'll get it. Célestin Poux
is the "Mess Hall Marauder",

154
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,900
the "Kitchen Raider".

155
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:09,400
Fifteen minutes later,
he came back with it all.

156
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,300
Salted Guérande butter,

157
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,000
lavender honey,

158
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,300
and...

159
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,800
cocoa from Nigeria!

160
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:21,900
Grand...

161
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,900
Tell me, Cornflower,

162
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,300
you've no one to write to?
A fiancée?

163
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:29,700
Mathilde.

164
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:32,200
Her name is Mathilde.

165
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:39,900
I hear her heart beating,
like Morse code.

166
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
We're engaged.

167
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,100
Luckily, we won't have to wait
till the end of the war.

168
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:56,000
Now I can go straight home
after the execution.

169
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,800
Should I spare you the rest?

170
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:12,500
I'm lame, not dim.

171
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,700
What happened?

172
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,700
We opened the barbed wire

173
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,300
and equipped the five
against the cold.

174
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,500
Célestin Poux gave up a red woolen
glove to protect your fiancé's hand.

175
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,300
Are they far?

176
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,600
Too far for grenades,
too near for artillery.

177
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:41,200
Gas is out of the question.
The gasser always gets it!

178
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,500
Think they'll make it?

179
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:46,200
If they're not blown to bits,
they'll starve and freeze.

180
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:49,000
Either way, it'll amuse the Jerries.

181
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,800
A Corporal gave Bastoche,
the carpenter, a hug.

182
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,900
It was Corporal Gordes.

183
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,500
They clearly knew each other
before the war.

184
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,200
And then,

185
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,400
over they went.

186
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,100
- Shit...
- Shut up.

187
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,400
- Shit!
- Shut up!

188
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,700
September '14.

189
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,700
150 pound weight, easy!

190
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,700
And I wasn't at my best!

191
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:34,500
But that morning,

192
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,800
in January '17,
was Manech still alive?

193
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,900
At dawn,
Favart called out their names.

194
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,900
Apart from the Dordogne farmer,
they all replied.

195
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,300
Bassignano!

196
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,400
Sir!

197
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,500
Bouquet!

198
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,000
What now?

199
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:53,900
Langonnet!

200
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,000
Yeah, still here!

201
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:58,900
The Cornflower,
hide yourself better.

202
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,800
Notre Dame!

203
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,600
That's all I know.

204
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,500
I wrote up my report
with a heavy heart.

205
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:20,300
About time, Esperanza! The Brits
are replacing us, we're off.

206
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,300
So, Bingo-thingy?

207
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:23,900
What's that?

208
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:27,300
The condemned prisoners' list,
signed by Capt. Favourier.

209
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,800
Give it to me.

210
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:42,000
Don't just stand there like that.
This isn't Pompeii!

211
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:45,300
You've been promoted.
You're off to the Vosges.

212
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,900
Even so, Sir,

213
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:50,000
this expedition is going to be
hard to swallow.

214
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,100
Lucky you.

215
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:54,100
Where you're going, there's
mustard gas and throat lozenges.

216
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,800
The famous Vosges sweets.

217
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:56,800
Dismissed!

218
00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:00,200
A few months later,
I was wounded, in the Somme.

219
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I ended up in the same ambulance
as Chardolot,

220
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,700
a corporal from Bingo Crépuscule.

221
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,100
But he only had
a few days left to live.

222
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,500
It's me. Esperanza.

223
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,600
Bingo Crépuscule, remember?

224
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,900
Sorry, I don't recognize you.

225
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:25,100
The five thrown over
into no-man's-land,

226
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,300
what happened to them?

227
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,700
What do you think?

228
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,300
No one made it.

229
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:34,600
Your conscience bothering you,
Esperanza?

230
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
You should've stuck around.

231
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,600
You'd have seen capital Ms,

232
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:44,000
underwear being waved
and a flying albatross.

233
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,400
You're delirious with fever!

234
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:52,900
We sent over five men
and recovered five stiffs.

235
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:54,300
Conclusion...

236
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,800
My eyes are gone but I can imagine
your expression and I like it.

237
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:06,800
He really spoke of capital Ms
and an albatross?

238
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,900
And underwear.

239
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,000
Here you go, Miss.

240
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:13,900
In here

241
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:18,300
are the prisoners' belongings
I was to return to their families.

242
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,300
My health's prevented it.

243
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,700
That's the letter
the Dordogne farmer, Notre Dame,

244
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:26,500
wrote to his wife.

245
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,600
I sent the original
just after Bingo.

246
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:32,900
You're here
because of the mustard gas?

247
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:36,300
Not even. Damned Spanish flu!

248
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,900
Death moves in mysterious ways.

249
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,800
If you can't cry, try talking.

250
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,400
If you can't talk, say nothing.

251
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:58,700
But sometimes,
talking can bring on the tears.

252
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,900
Tears say what you can't say,

253
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:02,700
if you get my drift?

254
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:08,500
Otherwise,
you can just keep that sour-face!

255
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,500
Little Louis,
tell Véro I'm thinking of her.

256
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,600
Shame she won't talk to me.

257
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,900
Saw Biscuit, we patched things up.

258
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,900
Adieu, my friend. Bastoche.

259
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:56,600
"Benoît Notre Dame, number 1818.
I won't be writing for a long time."

260
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:59,700
Tell old Bernay
I want to settle up by March.

261
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,100
His manure's too costly,
watch out for him.

262
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,500
Tell my Baptistin that I so love

263
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,600
that he'll be fine
if he listens to his dear mother.

264
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:12,300
She's the kindest person I know.
Love you. Benoît.

265
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,800
"For Tina Lombardi,
from Angel Bassignano."

266
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:01,900
If Chickpea comes in before
dinner's called, Manech is alive.

267
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:11,600
I'm not hungry.

268
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,900
Dinner's ready.

269
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,100
Mathilde, dinner!

270
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:22,800
Coming!

271
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:26,800
Mathilde was born
the 1 st of January, 1900.

272
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,300
It's easy for calculating her age.

273
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:33,500
In 1903, her parents died
in the n 44 bus accident.

274
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:34,400
Since then,

275
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,300
Mathilde often says to herself,

276
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:39,200
"Ashes to ashes, dust to dust!
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust..."

277
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,600
Her uncle and aunt,

278
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Sylvain and Bénédicte,
have raised her,

279
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:55,200
with her parents' life insurance
invested by Pierre-Marie Rouvière.

280
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:59,500
When she was five,
Mathilde came down with polio.

281
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,700
She was bedridden for months,

282
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:04,100
despite mustard compresses...

283
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,000
pendulums

284
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:07,900
and four-leaf clover infusions.

285
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,300
Today, Mathilde is twenty.

286
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,900
She plays the tuba.

287
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,900
It is the only instrument capable
of imitating a distress call.

288
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:23,700
Chickpea, the dog,
farts in his sleep.

289
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:27,300
When she hears it,
Bénédicte never fails to say,

290
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,200
Doggie fart, gladdens my heart.

291
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,900
Mathilde needs daily treatment.

292
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:35,900
Since the Armistice, Georges Cornu,
a swimming champion,

293
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:37,200
massages her.

294
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:41,500
She used to get embarrassed,
but she got over it.

295
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:45,100
Mathilde sometimes imagines
that Georges admires her,

296
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:46,600
tormented with desire.

297
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:48,800
What's more, he once said,

298
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,100
You do have a fine figure, Miss.

299
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,800
And I've kneaded quite a few.

300
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:59,100
After that,
how should she call him?

301
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:00,300
Dear Georges...

302
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,300
My dear Georges...

303
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:06,800
Jojo...

304
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:09,800
Sometimes,
before falling asleep,

305
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,100
she imagines herself
in arousing situations.

306
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,800
Mathilde doesn't need
to fantasize for very long

307
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,100
before reaching fulfilment.

308
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:26,200
Since his disappearance,

309
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:30,200
she can't bear to think about her
fiancé as she satisfies herself.

310
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:31,700
That's the way it is...

311
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:41,200
If I were you, Mathilde,
I'd forget him.

312
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,500
Why chase pipe dreams?

313
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:47,000
If he was alive,
you'd have heard from him.

314
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,800
He was taken prisoner.

315
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:53,500
And stayed with a German girl
with braids and big boobs!

316
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:56,300
A Breton boy eating sauerkraut!

317
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:57,100
Lmpossible!

318
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:02,000
- Can I help?
- Keep your feet on the ground.

319
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:03,800
I stand on my own two feet!

320
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,300
- What?
- Never mind.

321
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:06,800
I heard you anyway.

322
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,400
But your dreams don't stand up.

323
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:12,900
Manech
can't have been taken at Bingo.

324
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,900
Our men took the trench facing it.

325
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,600
Normally, it's the winners

326
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:20,100
who take prisoners.

327
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,800
So he's lost his mind.

328
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:25,000
Or he's in hiding,
to avoid hard labour.

329
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,500
Stop dreaming, Mathilde!

330
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:29,300
Face up to it.

331
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,100
You'll find a husband, despite...

332
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,500
Something's off-key.

333
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:43,100
I'll find the "Mess Hall Marauder",
Célestin Poux.

334
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,900
What can I get for you?

335
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:48,600
Or the Corsican's whore.
She might know more than me.

336
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,200
Tomorrow, I go to Paris.

337
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:52,600
What for?

338
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:55,000
To find a survivor
from Bingo Crépuscule.

339
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:06,100
Germain Pire, Private Detective
The Peerless Pry

340
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:12,100
I'm used to handling
red-hot affairs.

341
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,600
I've a cupboard full.

342
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:16,800
Scandals that would've been
brushed under the carpet...

343
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,600
brought to light by Pire's prying.

344
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,900
Take this big affair...

345
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:24,900
very delicate.

346
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:29,900
In '17, a train derails.
425 soldiers on leave, dead.

347
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:34,000
The enquiry reveals how
an officer ordered the departure,

348
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,700
despite faulty brakes.

349
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
A total cover-up
by Poincaré's government.

350
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:44,300
The victims' families only hope
of finding the officer?

351
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,400
Germain Pire!

352
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:48,800
The Peerless Pry.

353
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,900
Peerless, Miss.
I found their officer,

354
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:54,600
to the military's great displeasure.

355
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,500
Granted, he was dead and buried.

356
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:02,300
I'll just pack my bags and be on
my way to track down Poux Célestin

357
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,900
and the Corsican's fiancée.

358
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,100
And your fees, Mr. Peerless Pry?

359
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:11,500
The Pry only bleeds dry
sitting ducks, Miss.

360
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:14,400
For you, I can do...

361
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:16,700
20 francs a day.

362
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:19,000
Plus expenses, of course.

363
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,700
Why so kind?

364
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:25,100
Hélène, come and say hello.

365
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:28,700
Don't worry about expenses.
Germain Pire eats little,

366
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:31,900
doesn't drink and tips sparingly.

367
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:40,900
Notre Dame de Paris?

368
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:43,000
Not Notre Dame de Paris!

369
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,800
I'm calling from Paris
about Notre Dame Benoît!

370
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:47,600
Benoît Notre Dame!

371
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:49,400
A strapping,
good-hearted farmer.

372
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:51,400
Died for his country.

373
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,700
I've lost many a parishioner.

374
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,800
Are his wife and Baptistin
still there?

375
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,900
Quiet!
Miss Minet, I can't hear a thing!

376
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:04,000
No. She upped and left one day,
with no forwarding address.

377
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,300
Is that a choir I hear?

378
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:10,100
Of course, it's a choir!
We are in a church, Miss!

379
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:12,300
But that's no hymn at your end!

380
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,400
Thank you, Father. Goodbye.

381
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:19,900
Bingo Crépuscule!

382
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,400
I can't make head nor tail of it!

383
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:25,500
I thought you liked defending
lost causes.

384
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:29,800
Your impertinence
was charming at 10, not at 20!

385
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:31,400
Then start taking me seriously.

386
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,400
You're wasting your money
on a grotesque crusade!

387
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,700
Bingo Crépuscule!
Why not Yippee doodle-doo?

388
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:41,600
I want access to army archives.

389
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:47,400
Let's say
there's an ounce of truth in this.

390
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:50,200
If one man has survived,
he risks hard labour!

391
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:51,600
And you know it!

392
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:54,600
Your prying would put him
in great danger!

393
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,100
Be reasonable.

394
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,600
Your parents entrusted me...

395
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,000
"Ashes to ashes..."

396
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,800
That's just it.

397
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:06,000
They entrusted you
with my happiness.

398
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,400
Goodbye.

399
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,500
Thank you, Pierre-Marie.

400
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:20,500
Don't be like that,
my dear Mathilde.

401
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,200
I'm thinking of your future.

402
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:27,900
Sorry to see your health's worsened,
despite the massages.

403
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,700
I'll see what I can do.

404
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,800
It doesn't only happen in Lourdes!

405
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:18,200
I'm looking for Tina Lombardi.
I knew her when she was little...

406
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,900
Ladies, I'm Tina Lombardi's uncle

407
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:28,200
and I'd like to know...

408
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,500
Excuse me...

409
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:39,900
I look after
the Lombardi family's interests

410
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,600
and I'm looking for Tina.

411
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:44,700
She's come into some money.

412
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,500
You're the one
looking for Tina Lombardi?

413
00:32:58,100 --> 00:32:59,200
Well, actually...

414
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,500
Ever been to Corsica?

415
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:10,800
Very pretty, very picturesque.

416
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:13,100
But Tina's walking the street

417
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,300
somewhere else.

418
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:17,400
Luckily,
a highly-placed member of the Police

419
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:19,700
picked up her trail in Bar-Le-Duc.

420
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,300
Valentina Emilia Maria Lombardi,
aka Tina,

421
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,800
was registered in 1916

422
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:29,600
near the 23rd regiment's camp
of Marseilles.

423
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:34,200
Since the Armistice,
the chick has flown the coop!

424
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,100
I've lost her trail,
but I've been busy.

425
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,200
She's disappeared into thin air.

426
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,400
So, you're giving up.

427
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,500
Not at all.

428
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,600
Pire never admits defeat.
Pire is stubborn.

429
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,900
Pire's peer doesn't exist.

430
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,900
Perfect! Thank you.

431
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,500
Just a little bit.

432
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:44,000
Not my eyes.

433
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:10,900
Careful with that!

434
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,600
What can I get you?

435
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
This is my fiancé.

436
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:14,800
And him,

437
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:16,200
the carpenter...

438
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:17,900
I think you know him.

439
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:25,900
My throat's dry.

440
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:29,300
- "Good glass of wine..."
- "Keeps the doctor in line."

441
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,800
My great-aunt's motto.

442
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,500
Died in 1911 in Besancon,
she was 99.

443
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,400
Never sick a day...

444
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:42,500
Good luck.

445
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,100
Touch wood.

446
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:46,900
The war?

447
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:52,600
A hyena in the Botanical Gardens.

448
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:54,700
I was showing off, stroking it.

449
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:57,100
Bastoche and Biscuit made this.

450
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:58,900
Biscuit?

451
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,600
His best friend. They met in 1910

452
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:04,800
during the floods,
saving a lady's life.

453
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,900
Bastoche was talented

454
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:09,600
but Biscuit... a genius.

455
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:11,900
A magician with a chisel!

456
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:16,100
He pegged all the articulations.

457
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:22,200
This is for you.

458
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:24,900
"Louis,
tell Véro I'm thinking of her.

459
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,900
"Shame she won't talk to me.

460
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,600
"Saw Biscuit, we patched things up.

461
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,000
"Adieu, my friend. Bastoche."

462
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:39,400
To patch things up means
they'd argued. You know why?

463
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:40,800
A mystery.

464
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,900
They went through hell together,

465
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:48,100
the Marne, the Woëvre, the Somme...

466
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:52,200
Then one day, and who knows why,
they stopped talking.

467
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,800
Biscuit was transferred.

468
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,800
He died
in a military hospital bombing.

469
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,300
I'm glad they finally
patched things up.

470
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:10,600
They won't be queuing up outside,
today.

471
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:12,000
Pour me one?

472
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:14,000
She's thirsty!

473
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:18,600
A wooden hand, a heart of gold.

474
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:20,400
To love.

475
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:21,800
True love!

476
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,400
But who was Véro?

477
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Véronique Passavant.
His regular, his woman.

478
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:28,700
They often came in together.

479
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:31,100
Why would they have argued?

480
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:34,200
He may have strayed
and she wouldn't forgive him.

481
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,500
There you go. '17, this way.

482
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:47,500
What exactly are the red files?

483
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:48,900
Secret defence.

484
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:51,100
You need a mandate
from someone high up.

485
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,600
Of course, they're upstairs!

486
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:54,000
Go and help him.

487
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,800
Let's say
you were someone high up...

488
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,600
then you could give us the mandate.

489
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,800
If I thought like that,
I wouldn't be an officer.

490
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:09,500
Consider yourself lucky
you've been allowed in.

491
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:12,000
It usually takes months.

492
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,700
It looks tidy
but it's really a mess.

493
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:17,800
So, the Somme...

494
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:21,100
The Bouchavesnes sector,
trench 108.

495
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:23,600
What a state...

496
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:25,800
Look at this. Appalling!

497
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:28,600
May I help?

498
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,800
Thank you for replying favourably
to the General...

499
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:34,000
We're very good friends.

500
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:37,200
Bouchavesnes...
two friends of mine died there.

501
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,100
Dreadful,
the battles in that trench...

502
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,200
Paris wasn't much better.

503
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:44,700
Couldn't even find a taxi
after the opera.

504
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:46,200
So I heard!

505
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:49,000
We'd like information on trench 108.

506
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:52,800
Posting slips, trenches 104, 105.

507
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:55,400
Trench 107. Where's 106?

508
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,500
Trench 108.

509
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,500
How annoying,
it's written on both sides!

510
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,500
Trench 108.

511
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:09,300
"Dug by the Germans,
taken by us in 1916 and renamed

512
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,600
"Bingo Crépuscule."
Why not Yippee doodle-doo?

513
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,600
"January 6th, nothing to report.

514
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,700
"The 7th, heavy combat with losses.

515
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:19,900
"Killed in action:
Capt. Favourier, history teacher.

516
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,700
"Lt Benoît Estrangin,
insurance agent.

517
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:24,800
"Corporal..."

518
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,100
Strange.

519
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,500
Certain losses
are filed confidential.

520
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:33,100
Confidential? You mean...

521
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:34,900
Sorry.

522
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:36,900
Can't you...

523
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Sorry, we can't look any further.

524
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,800
Not even the General.

525
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:44,100
Please.

526
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:56,200
Thank you for the time you've taken.

527
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:57,400
You're welcome.

528
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:04,400
Nothing here of interest.
Posting slips, commissary bills.

529
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:05,700
The routine.

530
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,500
I assumed as much.

531
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,300
It was to be expected.

532
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:14,700
You've gone too far!

533
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:25,000
I do hope this paper
wasn't filed secret defence!

534
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,300
You must tell me if it's important.

535
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:34,900
It's nothing.

536
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:38,100
Just a leave.

537
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:39,900
From the President?

538
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:41,800
That's right.

539
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:43,700
President Poincaré
sometimes granted a leave

540
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:45,300
to a deserving soldier.

541
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,100
End of story!

542
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:49,000
I'll see you out.

543
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:12,800
Corporal Bouquet Kléber...

544
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,100
Corporal Gaignard Francis...

545
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:18,000
Private Notre Dame Benoît...

546
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:20,500
Private Bassignano Angel...

547
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:23,100
Private Langonnet Manech...

548
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:26,600
For self-mutilation,
you are sentenced to death.

549
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:33,500
Lf, before the count of 7,
the train hasn't entered the tunnel,

550
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:35,800
or the ticket inspector hasn't come,

551
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,500
Manech is dead!

552
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:41,900
1, 2, 3,

553
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:47,100
4, 5, 6...

554
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:49,400
Ticket, please!

555
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:51,800
April fool!

556
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:12,500
When the newspaper strike is over,
we can place your ad.

557
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:16,800
"Reward for information concerning
Bingo Crépuscule."

558
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,700
Encouraging her
won't bring back her appetite.

559
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:21,400
Take her to the Quimper Fair.

560
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:23,000
What for?

561
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:24,500
A change of scenery.

562
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:27,100
You might meet a nice boy.

563
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:28,600
What for?

564
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:32,300
To get married and have children.
Tell her!

565
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:34,000
Can you pour me one?

566
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:35,100
You drink now?

567
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:37,800
"Glass of wine
keeps the doctor in line."

568
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:39,600
Where's that from?

569
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:42,000
Dead-Hand barman
with a wooden hand.

570
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:45,600
His aunt's motto. Died at a hundred,
in Besancon, 1911.

571
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:47,100
Repeat that?

572
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:50,700
In Besancon, in 1911,

573
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:54,100
a 99 year-old lady left behind
a wooden-handed nephew,

574
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:57,100
owner of the Dead-Hand bar,
in Golden Hand St,

575
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:59,800
to whom she often said
what Sylvain just asked me.

576
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:02,300
She's already drunk!

577
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:38,900
Look!

578
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:42,800
An albatross is stubborn.

579
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:47,200
He knows he can outlast the wind.

580
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:35,800
Hey, my gravel!

581
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:37,400
My gravel!

582
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:42,500
Véronique Passavant,
17th of July, 1920.

583
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:46,300
I'm writing from Little Louis' bar.
He told me about you.

584
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:48,800
I must tell you about an encounter

585
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:50,300
which left me quite shaken up.

586
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:53,800
I headed for Bastoche's workshop.
I was feeling down.

587
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:56,100
I want to talk to Bastoche.

588
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Bastoche?

589
00:45:58,300 --> 00:46:02,100
He died. At the Front in the Somme.
Didn't you know?

590
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:03,800
I know something else.

591
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:05,100
What?

592
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:09,200
From the hospital,
where I care for dying syphilitics,

593
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,400
a patient sends you this.

594
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:17,300
If you don't want to die, covered
with oozing sores, answer me!

595
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:20,700
The comrade hiding
with your Bastoche...

596
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,100
Tell me...

597
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:24,100
tell me he's Corsican.

598
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,300
I was already traumatized by nuns
when I was little!

599
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:32,300
Tina Lombardi
knows something we don't.

600
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:34,600
What?

601
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,200
The Lombardi girl...

602
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:38,900
she knows something we don't.

603
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:43,400
That would prove
Bastoche had escaped.

604
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:46,000
With another condemned prisoner.

605
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:49,100
That hussy obviously thinks
it's her Angel.

606
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:54,100
But if Bastoche had escaped,
he'd have looked out for Manech.

607
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:55,600
If he escaped...

608
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:56,700
Give me that.

609
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:00,000
With "ifs",
a flea could carry an elephant.

610
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:01,400
Maybe.

611
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:04,100
But without "ifs",
might as well hang myself.

612
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:14,600
Thanks to you, I spend my time
picking gravel out of the lawn!

613
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:18,300
When I see gravel, I make it a point
of arriving in style.

614
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:19,400
For the Miss.

615
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:22,600
Leprince Hardware,
Paris, 25th of July, 1920.

616
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:26,000
Sunday lends itself to writing.
I'm replying regarding

617
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:28,900
Célestin Poux and other survivors
from Bingo Crépuscule.

618
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:32,800
I knew the fellow.
The smartest thief I ever met.

619
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:35,500
Thanks to him,
I never went without!

620
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:41,900
Olivier Nergeton,
Animated Toys.

621
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:44,900
Célestin Poux was our salvation,

622
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:47,500
aka the Mess Hall Marauder
or Justa Bit More.

623
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:48,900
He falsified losses,

624
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:52,300
making up numbers
to give double rations.

625
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:56,400
If you should see him,
tell him we'll never forget him.

626
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:01,700
Etienne Morillon, teacher,
3rd of August, 1920.

627
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,900
He always had us laughing.

628
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:07,100
He had even trained
the company's mascot for us!

629
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,700
Good morning. What weather!

630
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:14,400
Germain Pire, private detective.

631
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:16,200
Mathilde has spoken of you.

632
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:18,200
Sylvain!

633
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:20,600
Tell Mathilde to come down.

634
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:22,900
That Mr. Pry is here to see her.

635
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:25,600
Poux's been hopping around.

636
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:29,800
Two days in Dreux,
then Troyes, Castre,

637
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:31,200
five days in Sète.

638
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:38,600
It'll take luck and patience
to land him.

639
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:40,100
Too bad.

640
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:44,000
Hélène, some savoury biscuits.

641
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:45,600
Taste them.

642
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:47,400
Tell me what you think.

643
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:50,400
The kitchen's more comfortable.

644
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:52,100
Thank you, Bénédicte.

645
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:55,300
I'll leave you.

646
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:01,500
Poux can't stay in one place,
whereas Tina Lombardi...

647
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:03,500
she's got us running in circles.

648
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:06,300
I know.
And she's the queen of disguise.

649
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:08,200
Anything new on Biscuit?

650
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:15,100
That's Benjamin Gordes.

651
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:16,300
The day he won

652
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:20,000
the Carpentry Prize
for the sixth consecutive year.

653
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:25,000
That's right.

654
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:28,500
Biscuit,

655
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,400
Bastoche's best friend,

656
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:32,300
is none other than Benjamin Gordes.

657
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:36,700
A soldier from their company

658
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:40,500
said they were like brothers
before it went sour.

659
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:44,600
- Why won't you tell me?
- Stop it!

660
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:45,800
Tell me!

661
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:48,700
I don't want to fight you,
so stop it!

662
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:50,800
Why won't you talk?

663
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:52,700
Whose idea was it?

664
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:56,600
Mine?
No, it was your idea!

665
00:49:56,900 --> 00:49:57,800
Bastard!

666
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,300
It was his idea!

667
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:03,900
All because of a woman!

668
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:08,300
Véronique Passavant
finished with Bastoche in June '16.

669
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:12,300
And just after, he fought like
a mad dog with Benjamin Gordes.

670
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:14,500
Don't need to be Pythagoras!

671
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:17,300
They didn't meet again
before Bingo Crépuscule?

672
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:19,100
Where it all ended!

673
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:21,000
No, where it all begins, Mr. Pire.

674
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:22,800
Where it all begins...

675
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:26,900
Tina Lombardi is sure
Bastoche is alive.

676
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:31,600
What made him different
from the others that evening?

677
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:34,900
He was the only carpenter?

678
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:38,700
Something made Bastoche
different from the others.

679
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:40,200
His German boots!

680
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:44,400
He was the only one
with German boots!

681
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:46,300
Of course. You're right!

682
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:50,900
Tina Lombardi's discovered that
a man with German boots survived!

683
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:54,400
I bet he was seen with a comrade!

684
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:57,500
I saw two soldiers
who looked like tramps.

685
00:50:57,800 --> 00:50:59,700
One wore boots taken from a Jerry.

686
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:01,800
He was holding up the other.

687
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:08,400
We also know Bastoche had patched
things up with his best friend!

688
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:09,600
Exactly!

689
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,900
Did it change the course of events
that night?

690
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:15,800
If I don't break the peel,

691
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:19,800
Gordes managed to save
Bastoche and Manech.

692
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:27,800
I'm never going to get that pie
in the oven!

693
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:29,600
I must go back to Paris.

694
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:32,200
I must go back to Paris.

695
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:36,500
Again?
That money's going up in smoke.

696
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:37,800
"Ashes to ashes..."

697
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:15,800
Pilot fish!

698
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:19,100
Excuse me, Elodie Gordes?

699
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:21,000
Over there, selling carrots.

700
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:22,900
Thank you.

701
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:34,100
Never seen him!

702
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:38,700
Which one don't you know?

703
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,700
Him, by any chance?

704
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:44,300
Why did Bastoche and Biscuit argue?
Was it over you?

705
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:45,500
I have nothing to say!

706
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:47,800
- I want to know!
- Leave me alone!

707
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:54,900
They last met at Bingo Crépuscule.

708
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:58,700
My fiancé was also there.
With Bastoche.

709
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:01,300
In that shithole of a trench!

710
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:03,100
I want to understand.

711
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:07,300
I want to understand!

712
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:14,200
It's not what you think.

713
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:18,400
I can't talk about it.
Give me your address.

714
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:21,100
My spelling's terrible

715
00:53:22,100 --> 00:53:24,000
but I'll explain it all in a letter.

716
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:25,100
I promise.

717
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:48,300
Go ahead! My gravel!

718
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:51,500
Nothing for me?

719
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:53,300
What?

720
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:54,900
Nothing for me?

721
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:56,900
Just the newspaper.

722
00:53:57,400 --> 00:54:00,200
They talk about everything
except Elodie Gordes.

723
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:01,300
Very funny!

724
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:04,600
You should read it,
one can learn things!

725
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:08,900
Has the President opened an inquest
on Bingo Crépuscule?

726
00:54:11,100 --> 00:54:13,500
He might have done,

727
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,000
if he hadn't fallen from a train
in his pyjamas.

728
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:19,400
Well, he wears pyjamas!

729
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:22,100
He wears pyjamas!

730
00:54:37,100 --> 00:54:39,000
We recovered five stiffs.

731
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:40,800
Conclusion...

732
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,200
We knew you were a thief.
But a pyromaniac?

733
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:09,400
All for me?

734
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:11,300
No. Just this one.

735
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:15,100
If I'm not picking up gravel,
I'm picking up the postman!

736
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:20,600
The gravel's gone? A fair fight.

737
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:22,200
Fighting is never fair.

738
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:24,700
- Can I offer you a short one?
- Won't say no.

739
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:29,500
Miss, I beg you to keep my secret
to yourself.

740
00:55:29,900 --> 00:55:32,900
When I met my husband,
he already had four children.

741
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:34,200
None were his.

742
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:36,800
Out of kindness,
he'd married a widow with TB.

743
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:38,600
She was Polish, like me.

744
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:41,000
He adopted her children
before her death.

745
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:43,000
I was also an unmarried mother.

746
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:47,600
He then found himself
the father of five,

747
00:55:47,900 --> 00:55:49,900
though he couldn't have any
of his own.

748
00:55:56,500 --> 00:55:58,100
You're going to run me over!

749
00:55:58,700 --> 00:56:00,700
We had four years of tenderness.

750
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:02,200
We had plans.

751
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:05,000
We dreamt
of seeing the sea together.

752
00:56:05,300 --> 00:56:06,800
Then the war came.

753
00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:10,400
I thought Bastoche
would take care of him,

754
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:11,900
their being posted together.

755
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:15,000
But during his leave,
in September, 1915,

756
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:17,000
just after the battle of Artois,

757
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:20,400
I knew
nothing would ever be the same.

758
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:31,700
Over there,
it's all we have to keep going.

759
00:56:47,700 --> 00:56:50,400
Once, in a burning field,
I saw some comrades...

760
00:56:50,700 --> 00:56:53,400
Their cartridge belts
exploded like fireworks.

761
00:56:57,600 --> 00:57:01,200
Once, we even had to use
the body of a friend

762
00:57:02,100 --> 00:57:04,000
as a shield.

763
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:18,000
There had been something
on his mind.

764
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:20,800
He came out with it
on the second night.

765
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:25,700
If I desert, the gendarmes
will come and get me.

766
00:57:28,100 --> 00:57:30,800
My only way out
is to have a sixth child.

767
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:37,000
If you have six children,
they send you home.

768
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:41,000
As I said,
he couldn't have children.

769
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:43,600
I didn't dare think
what was on his mind,

770
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:45,900
but he just wouldn't let it go.

771
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:53,400
It's not betrayal if I'm asking you.

772
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:55,300
Especially if it's with Bastoche.

773
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:57,100
Don't touch!

774
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:03,100
The five aren't mine,
so why not a sixth?

775
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:06,800
You'd have nine months to wait.
The war will be over by then.

776
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,600
It will never be over. Never!

777
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:12,000
They'd be nine months of hope.
Have you no heart?

778
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:16,000
And then one day, I found a note
from Kléber Bouquet,

779
00:58:16,300 --> 00:58:17,900
known as Bastoche,

780
00:58:18,100 --> 00:58:22,400
saying to tie a coloured cloth at
the window if he wasn't to come up.

781
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:37,300
Coffee?

782
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:39,000
I'd love some!

783
00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:40,900
- After you.
- Please.

784
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:50,400
Thank you.

785
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:54,900
Sugar?

786
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:56,700
No, thank you.

787
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,100
It's mother of pearl?

788
00:59:04,900 --> 00:59:06,900
Yes, Benjamin made it.

789
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:16,900
- It's odd...
- How strange we never met.

790
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:21,000
The children aren't here?

791
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:22,400
Yes, but...

792
00:59:23,100 --> 00:59:24,600
they're playing outside.

793
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:32,300
- A pick-me-up?
- Please.

794
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:34,900
No, no... Sorry.

795
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:37,100
I don't fancy one.

796
00:59:39,700 --> 00:59:41,400
Neither do I.

797
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:45,200
Elodie, we'll say we've done it.

798
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:48,200
It'll calm him down.

799
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:51,200
It will make things easier
for you, for me...

800
00:59:52,100 --> 00:59:53,400
for everybody.

801
01:01:02,100 --> 01:01:04,900
Funny how your smile
opens the parentheses.

802
01:01:07,700 --> 01:01:09,700
I'll close them
as late as possible...

803
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:12,900
In two days, at the train station.

804
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:33,500
Come on...

805
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:36,200
give me one last smile.

806
01:01:38,500 --> 01:01:40,400
To close the parentheses.

807
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:43,300
I didn't even get pregnant!

808
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:47,000
But soon, fear no longer tormented
my husband.

809
01:01:48,100 --> 01:01:49,400
It was jealousy.

810
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:53,400
"Where? When? Often?
Which positions?"

811
01:01:53,700 --> 01:01:57,500
"Did you enjoy it?" It became
a living hell for both of us.

812
01:01:58,600 --> 01:02:01,600
Now, Bastoche is dead,
as you know,

813
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:05,200
and my husband was killed
in a hospital bombing.

814
01:02:06,100 --> 01:02:10,600
It's a relief to confide in you.
At times, I think I'm going mad.

815
01:02:10,900 --> 01:02:12,200
Elodie Gordes.

816
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:14,600
Matti! Hurry up.

817
01:02:14,900 --> 01:02:17,500
Mr. Rouvière is on the phone.
He's waiting.

818
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:18,800
Come on!

819
01:02:35,300 --> 01:02:37,500
Mathilde? Pierre-Marie here.

820
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,500
I have some bad news.

821
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:46,000
Not really bad... News you're
already supposed to know.

822
01:02:47,100 --> 01:02:49,500
But news you can no longer ignore.

823
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:53,400
You were right about one thing...

824
01:02:53,700 --> 01:02:58,600
Manech and his four comrades
were in that absurdly named trench.

825
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:02,100
They were buried
in the Herdelin cemetery,

826
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:08,500
after being temporarily buried
under a tarpaulin in a bomb crater.

827
01:03:09,900 --> 01:03:11,400
That's that, my dear Mathilde.

828
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:24,600
In June, 1909,
Mathilde is 9 years old.

829
01:03:25,300 --> 01:03:27,200
Manech Langonnet is 10.

830
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:29,000
Does it hurt when you walk?

831
01:03:30,500 --> 01:03:32,600
It's Friday, or Saturday...

832
01:03:33,700 --> 01:03:35,500
Mathilde can't remember.

833
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:41,100
Do you have any friends?

834
01:03:42,700 --> 01:03:44,600
I can be your friend.

835
01:03:48,700 --> 01:03:50,200
Do I stink of fish?

836
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:53,600
Ever been
to the top of the lighthouse?

837
01:03:54,300 --> 01:03:56,900
I can carry you
to the top of the stairs.

838
01:03:58,200 --> 01:04:00,800
Because my dad's the keeper!

839
01:04:01,900 --> 01:04:05,300
Be stuck-up then! Church mouse!
Country bumpkin!

840
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:07,800
Do you want a kick in the pants?

841
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:32,200
Can you see far from the top?

842
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:10,100
I'm going to gobble up your ears!

843
01:05:14,700 --> 01:05:16,900
I'll throw you in the dungeon!

844
01:05:20,900 --> 01:05:23,600
I am the squid's servant!

845
01:05:36,900 --> 01:05:38,500
Doggie fart, gladdens my heart!

846
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,200
Manech's Marrying Mathilde!

847
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:28,200
Mathilde's Marrying Manech!

848
01:07:55,700 --> 01:07:58,100
- I don't smoke.
- I know, but take it...

849
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:01,800
It'll help you make new friends.

850
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:39,100
If I reach the bend before the car,

851
01:08:39,400 --> 01:08:41,200
Manech will come back alive!

852
01:08:43,300 --> 01:08:44,900
If I reach the bend...

853
01:08:53,900 --> 01:08:55,800
If I reach the bend
before the car...

854
01:08:57,700 --> 01:08:59,400
Manech will come back alive...

855
01:09:06,100 --> 01:09:07,500
If I reach the bend...

856
01:10:04,300 --> 01:10:07,100
You used to brag
about being one year older than me.

857
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:09,600
Now I'm older than you.

858
01:10:11,900 --> 01:10:14,300
The man who gave you his glove
is called Poux.

859
01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:16,400
Célestin Poux.

860
01:10:16,900 --> 01:10:18,300
Funny, isn't it?

861
01:10:20,700 --> 01:10:24,400
The man I hired to find him is Pire.

862
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:26,700
Germain Pire.

863
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:29,600
Strange name, too.

864
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:33,600
Either way, he hasn't found him.
Nor the Corsican's whore.

865
01:10:36,500 --> 01:10:38,400
The wire's snapped, Manech,

866
01:10:39,500 --> 01:10:40,900
but I'm not giving up.

867
01:10:43,100 --> 01:10:45,600
I still believe
that Tina Lombardi's a lead.

868
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:49,500
I need to be sure.

869
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:51,200
You understand, right?

870
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:56,600
That's why
I must find Célestin Poux.

871
01:11:01,700 --> 01:11:03,800
You can be really annoying,
you know.

872
01:11:06,100 --> 01:11:08,300
We would be
so much better in Brittany.

873
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:13,000
Let's go, Mathilde.

874
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:16,400
You'll catch cold.

875
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:44,100
Thouvenel!

876
01:11:48,500 --> 01:11:49,800
What do you want?

877
01:11:57,500 --> 01:11:58,800
Who are you?

878
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:04,600
Was it you who phoned?

879
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:07,500
Who are you?

880
01:12:36,200 --> 01:12:40,000
The days go by.
Still no news of Célestin Poux.

881
01:12:40,300 --> 01:12:42,100
Mathilde's sadness is overwhelming.

882
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:45,900
She must eat.
She's making herself ill.

883
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:47,900
Leave her the marrowbone.

884
01:12:54,600 --> 01:12:57,400
Her sadness is beginning
to rub off on us.

885
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:03,000
And so,

886
01:13:03,500 --> 01:13:06,500
in the middle of the night
on the 15th of September, 1920,

887
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:08,400
the wire is re-tied.

888
01:13:27,500 --> 01:13:30,000
"Victory!
I've finally found the roaming Poux.

889
01:13:30,200 --> 01:13:32,200
"Sent by the grace of God
and Davidson motors.

890
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:35,200
"All expenses paid, of course.
Germain Pire."

891
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:39,700
Célestin Poux, Terror of the Tarmac!

892
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:41,600
The ad was yours?

893
01:13:41,900 --> 01:13:44,500
Mathilde tightly clasps her hands,

894
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:47,200
to keep from shaking and crying

895
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:49,800
and making a fool of herself.

896
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:53,600
I didn't actually see
your fiancé get hit.

897
01:13:53,800 --> 01:13:55,000
I went to get the stew

898
01:13:55,300 --> 01:13:57,300
and ran into Lebègue,
a guy I met in the Vosges.

899
01:13:57,600 --> 01:14:01,400
A native of the Meuse.
Or rather a naïve of the Meuse.

900
01:14:01,700 --> 01:14:05,000
Even so, he could tell good coffee
from a stomach remedy.

901
01:14:05,300 --> 01:14:08,800
I know. I tried to sell him
a mixture of coffee and charcoal

902
01:14:09,100 --> 01:14:10,700
in exchange for
some Dutch tobacco.

903
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:12,600
So, the last time you saw Manech,

904
01:14:13,500 --> 01:14:14,800
he was alive?

905
01:14:16,700 --> 01:14:18,800
You couldn't miss him.

906
01:14:19,100 --> 01:14:21,100
Carving Ms on a burnt tree trunk,

907
01:14:21,500 --> 01:14:23,400
smack in the middle
of no-man's-land.

908
01:14:23,900 --> 01:14:27,000
He carved three Ms
before the albatross got him.

909
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:29,800
Albatross!

910
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:31,800
"Albatross.

911
01:14:32,300 --> 01:14:34,200
"Great sweeping sea bird,

912
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:37,100
"indolent traveling companion,

913
01:14:37,800 --> 01:14:39,500
"gliding with ships

914
01:14:39,700 --> 01:14:41,200
"upon bitter deep."

915
01:14:42,900 --> 01:14:44,600
It's a poem by Baudelaire.

916
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:46,900
It was also a Jerry bomber.

917
01:14:47,300 --> 01:14:48,900
The machine gun was at the rear.

918
01:14:49,100 --> 01:14:51,600
We couldn't shoot yet
through the propeller.

919
01:15:34,700 --> 01:15:36,800
It was you who gave him the glove?

920
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:39,900
A thick woolen red one.

921
01:15:40,200 --> 01:15:43,700
My fiancée spent her time
knitting scarves and mittens for me.

922
01:15:44,200 --> 01:15:46,700
I traded them
with frostbitten Senegalese

923
01:15:46,900 --> 01:15:49,100
in exchange for Germans' gold teeth.

924
01:15:49,700 --> 01:15:51,800
I melted them down
after the Armistice.

925
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:53,200
They paid for my Harley.

926
01:15:54,100 --> 01:15:55,000
But...

927
01:15:55,900 --> 01:15:58,000
are you sure Manech's dead?

928
01:16:00,100 --> 01:16:02,700
A comrade told me,
with a wound like that...

929
01:16:03,300 --> 01:16:05,200
he didn't stand a chance.

930
01:16:06,500 --> 01:16:10,400
I only saw three of them get killed
with my own eyes.

931
01:16:10,700 --> 01:16:11,800
I surrender!

932
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:13,700
I surrender!

933
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:15,000
Don't shoot!

934
01:16:15,700 --> 01:16:17,400
I beg you! I surrender!

935
01:16:18,100 --> 01:16:19,700
Let me through!

936
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:21,500
I'm on your side!

937
01:16:27,700 --> 01:16:30,100
I'm not French, I'm Corsican!

938
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:32,000
I've nothing against you!

939
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:33,800
Poor bastard.

940
01:16:36,500 --> 01:16:37,800
So, he's not French!

941
01:16:39,400 --> 01:16:40,800
Let's cancel his birth certificate.

942
01:16:46,700 --> 01:16:48,800
A French corporal dealt with him...

943
01:16:49,300 --> 01:16:52,000
Thouvenel. A trigger-happy swine!

944
01:16:53,100 --> 01:16:55,700
He had a heart made of stone,
but a sharp eye.

945
01:16:57,100 --> 01:16:58,200
Poor bastard!

946
01:17:00,200 --> 01:17:01,700
I guess you like it.

947
01:17:02,100 --> 01:17:04,200
I'd kill my parents for a good stew!

948
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:06,400
Don't worry, he's an orphan.

949
01:17:06,600 --> 01:17:08,200
The same goes for truffles.

950
01:17:08,500 --> 01:17:11,600
If you like truffles,
I have one from Périgord...

951
01:17:11,900 --> 01:17:13,800
Which ones did you see die?

952
01:17:14,900 --> 01:17:16,300
The one with gangrene.

953
01:17:17,700 --> 01:17:18,400
Six-Sous.

954
01:17:18,900 --> 01:17:20,200
Yes, the welder.

955
01:17:21,700 --> 01:17:22,900
Comrades...

956
01:17:23,900 --> 01:17:25,200
Before dying...

957
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:27,000
I have a final request.

958
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:29,600
I want to piss standing up.

959
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:31,300
Like a man!

960
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:35,100
And then, you can fire away
to your heart's content!

961
01:17:38,100 --> 01:17:42,700
So long to life, so long to love

962
01:17:42,900 --> 01:17:46,500
So long to all those women

963
01:17:47,900 --> 01:17:49,300
It's all over

964
01:17:50,100 --> 01:17:52,300
Done forever

965
01:17:53,700 --> 01:17:56,600
This shameful war

966
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:00,700
At Craonne, on the plateau

967
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:04,600
That's where we'll leave our skins

968
01:18:04,900 --> 01:18:07,800
For we've all been sentenced

969
01:18:08,300 --> 01:18:13,200
We are the sacrificed

970
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:20,900
And Bastoche?

971
01:18:21,100 --> 01:18:22,700
He was so well hidden,

972
01:18:23,100 --> 01:18:24,700
we couldn't locate him.

973
01:18:25,100 --> 01:18:27,200
Even at dawn,
when he answered roll call,

974
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:30,900
no one knew where he was.
A ventriloquist!

975
01:18:31,100 --> 01:18:32,800
No, he was a carpenter.

976
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:34,200
No matter.

977
01:18:34,600 --> 01:18:38,200
He was shot down by the Albatross,
along with your fiancé.

978
01:19:01,100 --> 01:19:04,500
The Albatross caught fire
and crashed on the enemy line.

979
01:19:04,700 --> 01:19:06,000
Return to sender.

980
01:19:09,300 --> 01:19:11,500
What about the Dordogne farmer?

981
01:19:11,800 --> 01:19:14,700
He played dead from the beginning.
Not that it saved him.

982
01:19:15,500 --> 01:19:18,700
The Jerries didn't appreciate
the grenade.

983
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,800
Don't look!
Lt'll only make it worse.

984
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:25,300
When I got back with the stew,
bullets were flying everywhere.

985
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:28,000
Heavy shelling had begun.

986
01:19:57,200 --> 01:19:59,700
Damn! No one can imagine
what it's like.

987
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:03,900
Can't move your legs, your heart
beats like a scared animal.

988
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:42,000
Then I saw the Dordogne farmer
shatter into pieces.

989
01:20:49,100 --> 01:20:51,300
Attack,
before we're all slaughtered.

990
01:20:52,200 --> 01:20:54,100
Prepare bayonets!

991
01:21:08,300 --> 01:21:11,700
All that was nothing
compared to what followed.

992
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:14,300
For France!

993
01:21:15,300 --> 01:21:16,400
Charge!

994
01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:40,500
We'd passed
the five prisoners bodies

995
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:44,000
when the Jerry machine guns
started spitting bullets.

996
01:21:44,600 --> 01:21:45,700
We were wiped out!

997
01:22:30,200 --> 01:22:33,400
That Lavrouye bastard!
He kept the paper to himself.

998
01:22:33,700 --> 01:22:34,900
Stretcher-bearers!

999
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:37,800
What paper?

1000
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:40,200
That's all he said.

1001
01:22:46,500 --> 01:22:50,000
That evening, there was enough food
to feed an army.

1002
01:22:50,600 --> 01:22:53,400
Favart and Chardolot
were counting losses.

1003
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,700
Why do those five
show up on our battalion list?

1004
01:22:58,200 --> 01:22:59,500
We're only following orders.

1005
01:23:00,300 --> 01:23:01,400
Something stinks here.

1006
01:23:01,700 --> 01:23:04,100
Something stinks?
Lavrouye stinks.

1007
01:23:04,400 --> 01:23:08,100
This food doesn't.
Dig in before it gets cold.

1008
01:23:11,200 --> 01:23:12,400
It's cold!

1009
01:23:13,400 --> 01:23:16,300
So you only saw
three of them get killed.

1010
01:23:16,600 --> 01:23:17,500
With your own eyes.

1011
01:23:18,200 --> 01:23:21,300
False hope
will only make you suffer.

1012
01:23:21,500 --> 01:23:22,500
They're not false!

1013
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:24,100
You'll taste my cake?

1014
01:23:24,400 --> 01:23:25,600
I don't know if I should.

1015
01:23:25,900 --> 01:23:27,500
With a bit of fresh cream.

1016
01:23:27,800 --> 01:23:29,300
If you insist...

1017
01:23:30,300 --> 01:23:32,300
I like people
who appreciate my food.

1018
01:23:34,700 --> 01:23:36,300
I'll put her to bed.

1019
01:23:37,100 --> 01:23:38,900
Let's all get some sleep.

1020
01:23:59,300 --> 01:24:00,600
Slow down!

1021
01:24:03,400 --> 01:24:05,500
You lack control, no style...

1022
01:24:05,700 --> 01:24:08,400
You're better at raking
than skidding!

1023
01:24:08,600 --> 01:24:11,300
Hey, Postman! I'll drop you off
at the next letterbox.

1024
01:24:11,600 --> 01:24:12,300
And my bike?

1025
01:24:12,600 --> 01:24:15,900
Leave it to me. I fought in the war!
I don't have a desk job.

1026
01:24:18,100 --> 01:24:20,200
It's not my fault. I'm asthmatic!

1027
01:24:20,500 --> 01:24:22,100
An asthmatic who rides a bike!

1028
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:24,300
- By the sea.
- Sure, by the sea!

1029
01:24:24,600 --> 01:24:26,600
Célestin, it's not a sidecar.

1030
01:24:28,200 --> 01:24:31,000
Those men, they never grow up...

1031
01:24:31,200 --> 01:24:33,200
As long as they don't play soldiers.

1032
01:24:34,600 --> 01:24:38,700
"Tell old Bernay... settle up
by March. His manure's too costly..."

1033
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:42,600
He wouldn't write such trivialities.
Don't you agree?

1034
01:24:44,100 --> 01:24:45,700
There must be a code.

1035
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:47,200
Except lovers' codes

1036
01:24:47,500 --> 01:24:50,900
can't be cracked with brains
or divine intervention.

1037
01:24:53,300 --> 01:24:54,400
And Bastoche?

1038
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:58,500
If he was seen with his German
boots, he must have survived.

1039
01:24:58,700 --> 01:25:00,200
Not so, Miss.

1040
01:25:00,500 --> 01:25:04,200
Gordes didn't let him go over
the top with those boots.

1041
01:25:10,200 --> 01:25:11,600
If the Jerries see these,

1042
01:25:12,100 --> 01:25:14,600
they'll know
you've stripped one of their dead.

1043
01:25:19,200 --> 01:25:21,800
So Tina Lombardi's
on the wrong track.

1044
01:25:23,700 --> 01:25:25,000
The one with the boots

1045
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:28,000
wasn't Bastoche.

1046
01:25:28,300 --> 01:25:29,500
It was Gordes!

1047
01:25:29,800 --> 01:25:30,700
That's right, Miss!

1048
01:25:31,800 --> 01:25:33,400
He was with a boy,

1049
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:35,200
from the class of '17...
Desrochelles.

1050
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:39,100
I'd met some stretcher-bearers
who'd just passed them.

1051
01:25:40,500 --> 01:25:41,700
Are you from Bingo?

1052
01:25:42,200 --> 01:25:43,400
Might be.

1053
01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:45,500
Tell them Gordes is wounded.

1054
01:25:45,800 --> 01:25:48,700
- He's with a boy who's worse off.
- Desrochelles.

1055
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:50,900
- They're off to first-aid.
- With German boots!

1056
01:25:51,200 --> 01:25:52,300
Long Live Anarchy!

1057
01:25:54,200 --> 01:25:55,500
Anarchy.

1058
01:26:11,300 --> 01:26:12,900
What's happened, Matti?

1059
01:26:13,500 --> 01:26:14,600
What did I say?

1060
01:26:16,300 --> 01:26:17,600
Open up!

1061
01:26:19,400 --> 01:26:20,900
Be reasonable.

1062
01:26:21,200 --> 01:26:23,000
- What did you do?
- Nothing.

1063
01:26:24,300 --> 01:26:26,200
You've known he's dead
for three years.

1064
01:26:26,500 --> 01:26:27,800
I call that stubbornness.

1065
01:26:28,300 --> 01:26:30,200
No, I call that hope.

1066
01:26:30,500 --> 01:26:31,900
Poux has just killed it.

1067
01:26:35,300 --> 01:26:37,500
If I can do anything...

1068
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:41,700
You can.

1069
01:26:43,100 --> 01:26:45,100
Take me to Bingo Crépuscule.

1070
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,500
An Indian princess on her elephant.

1071
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:06,200
With her hunters,
on the Trail of Sorrow.

1072
01:27:07,200 --> 01:27:08,500
It was there!

1073
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:09,900
Right there!

1074
01:27:12,100 --> 01:27:14,300
At a hundred yards, facing Bingo,

1075
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,600
was Erlangen, the Jerry trench.

1076
01:27:18,400 --> 01:27:20,700
Where's the burnt tree trunk?

1077
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:23,500
All the stumps and debris

1078
01:27:24,200 --> 01:27:27,300
were used to fill in the trenches.

1079
01:27:28,400 --> 01:27:32,300
We found the five over there,
under a tarpaulin,

1080
01:27:32,500 --> 01:27:34,500
covered with earth.

1081
01:27:34,900 --> 01:27:37,000
- Not a pretty sight.
- No doubt!

1082
01:27:37,200 --> 01:27:39,200
The youngest was only a boy.

1083
01:27:40,700 --> 01:27:42,800
Was he wearing a glove?

1084
01:27:43,300 --> 01:27:44,800
A red, woolen glove?

1085
01:27:45,100 --> 01:27:48,200
They all had
one bandaged hand, but...

1086
01:27:48,500 --> 01:27:52,000
nothing on the other.
I can't remember seeing a glove.

1087
01:27:52,200 --> 01:27:52,800
Athos!

1088
01:27:53,800 --> 01:27:56,400
I don't like him digging like that.

1089
01:27:56,700 --> 01:27:57,900
Around here,

1090
01:27:58,200 --> 01:28:02,400
you never know what junk
you might come across,

1091
01:28:02,600 --> 01:28:04,800
that can blow off an arm or a leg.

1092
01:28:07,500 --> 01:28:08,700
It's the crypt!

1093
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:12,400
There was a chapel
between the two trenches.

1094
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,100
It was in ruins.

1095
01:28:15,400 --> 01:28:17,800
Incredible.
I don't recognize a thing.

1096
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:43,700
Could Manech have lost the glove
as he fell?

1097
01:28:44,600 --> 01:28:47,200
It was tightly knitted
and tightly fitted.

1098
01:28:47,500 --> 01:28:51,200
I used the other one in the kitchens
until the end of the war.

1099
01:28:52,400 --> 01:28:54,300
Maybe he took it off to carve?

1100
01:28:56,100 --> 01:28:57,200
I couldn't say.

1101
01:28:57,700 --> 01:28:59,100
But I don't think so.

1102
01:28:59,700 --> 01:29:02,100
What sort of red was it? Bright red?

1103
01:29:03,400 --> 01:29:04,400
A flashy red.

1104
01:29:05,400 --> 01:29:08,700
With white dots.
Looked like maggots on an apple!

1105
01:29:22,500 --> 01:29:24,400
Sorry to disturb you like this.

1106
01:29:24,700 --> 01:29:28,200
My husband's family
suffered greatly in the war.

1107
01:29:28,400 --> 01:29:30,400
I didn't want to go over

1108
01:29:30,600 --> 01:29:33,500
to a French soldier's table
in front of him.

1109
01:29:35,500 --> 01:29:36,900
What can you tell me?

1110
01:29:37,600 --> 01:29:39,700
Before dying, my brother Gunther

1111
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:44,000
saw your fiancé carve
those three letters on a tree.

1112
01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:47,400
He was wearing a red, spotted glove.

1113
01:29:47,700 --> 01:29:50,200
A comrade of Gunther's
told me the story.

1114
01:29:51,100 --> 01:29:54,200
When our plane
shot down your fiancé,

1115
01:29:54,600 --> 01:29:56,400
they were sick to the stomach.

1116
01:29:56,900 --> 01:29:58,200
After that,

1117
01:29:58,500 --> 01:29:59,800
it was a nightmare.

1118
01:30:24,300 --> 01:30:27,900
God spared
that French soldier twice.

1119
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:34,500
Then... your side attacked.

1120
01:30:35,600 --> 01:30:37,100
They killed my brother.

1121
01:30:39,100 --> 01:30:40,600
He was 23 years old.

1122
01:30:41,300 --> 01:30:43,900
I came to see his cross
at the cemetery.

1123
01:30:44,200 --> 01:30:45,200
I'm sorry.

1124
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:50,000
Time heals all. You'll see.

1125
01:30:52,200 --> 01:30:54,800
I'll get back,
he'll be getting worried.

1126
01:31:04,900 --> 01:31:06,200
Seems I haven't killed it.

1127
01:31:07,100 --> 01:31:07,700
Pardon?

1128
01:31:08,400 --> 01:31:09,400
Hope!

1129
01:31:24,500 --> 01:31:25,600
What now?

1130
01:31:25,900 --> 01:31:28,700
Tina Lombardi.
She's going to the guillotine!

1131
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:30,800
They call her the "Officer Killer".

1132
01:31:31,500 --> 01:31:33,900
She's killed Lavrouye and Thouvenel.

1133
01:31:34,100 --> 01:31:36,600
And planned to kill Maréchal Pétain.

1134
01:31:43,600 --> 01:31:46,300
When I think you sat in a wheelchair
to soften me up!

1135
01:32:18,500 --> 01:32:19,900
I'll talk only to you,

1136
01:32:21,400 --> 01:32:23,300
because I know we're very similar.

1137
01:32:24,100 --> 01:32:26,000
We'll leave them alone.

1138
01:32:31,300 --> 01:32:33,000
What I did,
you could've done, too.

1139
01:32:34,100 --> 01:32:35,200
I don't think so.

1140
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:38,200
I'd be too scared.

1141
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:40,200
I'm not scared.

1142
01:32:41,500 --> 01:32:42,900
And I regret nothing.

1143
01:32:44,700 --> 01:32:45,900
Except my hair.

1144
01:32:47,500 --> 01:32:50,800
I'll be treated to a bowl-cut
before the execution.

1145
01:32:52,100 --> 01:32:55,300
I'll look like Joan of Arc
when I see my Angel!

1146
01:32:57,300 --> 01:32:59,400
Why did you want to kill Pétain?

1147
01:32:59,800 --> 01:33:02,500
Throwing mutilated soldiers
over the top was his idea.

1148
01:33:02,900 --> 01:33:04,700
Why not Poincaré?

1149
01:33:05,300 --> 01:33:06,500
He refused them a pardon.

1150
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:08,900
You don't know?

1151
01:33:11,100 --> 01:33:13,800
He did pardon them.
All five!

1152
01:33:14,400 --> 01:33:16,700
It's just a leave.

1153
01:33:17,100 --> 01:33:20,000
Lavrouye kept the paper for himself.

1154
01:33:20,500 --> 01:33:22,300
Why did that dog Lavrouye do that?

1155
01:33:23,400 --> 01:33:26,600
Because dirty dogs play dirty.
That's all.

1156
01:33:58,700 --> 01:34:00,400
Trust me on this.

1157
01:34:00,700 --> 01:34:02,100
I took care of him!

1158
01:34:05,900 --> 01:34:08,500
You and I have been running
the same investigation.

1159
01:34:09,700 --> 01:34:11,200
Each in our own way.

1160
01:34:13,900 --> 01:34:16,000
Looking for survivors from Bingo,

1161
01:34:16,500 --> 01:34:19,900
I picked up a male nurse
who'd treated Angel and the others.

1162
01:34:20,400 --> 01:34:23,700
This guy, Phillipot,
was sure he'd seen one of them.

1163
01:34:24,400 --> 01:34:26,600
A big man, with a head wound.

1164
01:34:26,900 --> 01:34:29,700
He was a big man.
Head wound, German boots...

1165
01:34:29,900 --> 01:34:33,900
He wore German boots and
was carrying a thin-built soldier.

1166
01:34:34,200 --> 01:34:37,100
I think that's about right.
I'm even sure of it.

1167
01:34:37,800 --> 01:34:39,600
A big man, head wound...

1168
01:34:40,400 --> 01:34:43,000
His superior told him
to keep his mouth shut.

1169
01:34:45,300 --> 01:34:47,800
You can imagine
how overwhelmed with hope I was.

1170
01:34:49,800 --> 01:34:52,300
And then, I met the man
who shattered my dreams.

1171
01:34:53,900 --> 01:34:55,500
Chief Sergeant Favart.

1172
01:34:57,300 --> 01:35:01,400
He told me how that pig Thouvenel
had shot my Angel, just like that!

1173
01:35:02,100 --> 01:35:03,500
Like taking a leak.

1174
01:35:09,100 --> 01:35:10,300
I took care of him, too!

1175
01:35:13,400 --> 01:35:14,800
It was an obsession.

1176
01:35:16,300 --> 01:35:18,600
Kill all those who hurt my man.

1177
01:35:23,500 --> 01:35:25,600
Your Angel left you this.

1178
01:35:45,800 --> 01:35:48,300
"Vengeance is pointless.
Try to be happy,

1179
01:35:48,600 --> 01:35:50,300
"and don't ruin your life for me.

1180
01:35:50,600 --> 01:35:52,300
"Your Angel from Hell."

1181
01:35:58,200 --> 01:36:00,700
Departure for Paris,
Platform 2.

1182
01:36:01,100 --> 01:36:04,200
Gordes, the one who switched boots
with Bastoche...

1183
01:36:04,500 --> 01:36:05,600
was he big?

1184
01:36:05,700 --> 01:36:09,200
Biscuit? He was no athlete.
Just a guy like you or me.

1185
01:36:09,500 --> 01:36:11,500
And you have no news
of Desrochelles?

1186
01:36:11,700 --> 01:36:15,900
He didn't make friends easily.
He lived alone with his mother.

1187
01:36:16,300 --> 01:36:19,300
I must go. I'm boarding in an hour
for Venezuela.

1188
01:36:20,300 --> 01:36:21,700
Good luck, Célestin!

1189
01:36:21,900 --> 01:36:23,000
To you too!

1190
01:36:30,800 --> 01:36:33,000
When I think
you hid Poincaré's pardon!

1191
01:36:34,500 --> 01:36:37,600
I didn't want to throw salt
on the wound.

1192
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:39,400
I'd like one last favour.

1193
01:36:40,300 --> 01:36:42,600
I suppose it concerns Bingo-thingy?

1194
01:36:43,200 --> 01:36:44,400
Son of bookseller,
Desrochelles Paul,

1195
01:36:44,700 --> 01:36:46,000
born in Sarreguemines,

1196
01:36:46,300 --> 01:36:48,700
died in February, 1897...

1197
01:36:50,100 --> 01:36:51,500
That's it, Desrochelles Jean!

1198
01:36:51,700 --> 01:36:52,700
What?

1199
01:36:55,200 --> 01:36:56,400
In Saintes.

1200
01:36:57,800 --> 01:36:58,700
In the Charentes.

1201
01:37:02,900 --> 01:37:06,300
Tell me, Mr. Pire, Tina Lombardi...
You had an inkling

1202
01:37:06,500 --> 01:37:07,900
of what she was up to.

1203
01:37:08,200 --> 01:37:10,300
Luckily, your paths didn't cross.

1204
01:37:10,600 --> 01:37:13,100
He who pries, flies,
when danger lurks.

1205
01:37:13,300 --> 01:37:15,500
He who pries, pries,
but, from a distance.

1206
01:37:15,700 --> 01:37:17,900
I've a new lead for you.

1207
01:37:18,100 --> 01:37:21,400
Jean Desrochelles. Evacuated from
the Front on the 7th of January '17.

1208
01:37:21,500 --> 01:37:25,100
His only next of kin was his mother,
the widow Desrochelles.

1209
01:37:25,400 --> 01:37:28,700
She lives at 22 rue de I'Abbaye.
Saintes, in the Charentes.

1210
01:37:29,100 --> 01:37:30,400
All the work's been done!

1211
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:35,200
You've tried to reach me?

1212
01:37:36,700 --> 01:37:39,500
My brother's comrade,
the one I told you about...

1213
01:37:39,800 --> 01:37:43,800
He remembered something
that might interest you.

1214
01:37:44,400 --> 01:37:48,000
The two French soldiers
escorting him that morning,

1215
01:37:48,300 --> 01:37:51,100
wanted to go back through
no-man's-land.

1216
01:37:51,400 --> 01:37:53,400
They saw the prisoners' bodies.

1217
01:37:53,700 --> 01:37:55,900
One was in a kind of small cellar.

1218
01:37:56,200 --> 01:37:58,800
The French soldiers
seemed surprised.

1219
01:37:59,400 --> 01:38:02,500
I don't know if that can help you.

1220
01:38:04,300 --> 01:38:05,200
Thank you.

1221
01:38:09,700 --> 01:38:12,500
"Tell old Bernay
I want to settle up by March.

1222
01:38:12,800 --> 01:38:16,300
"His manure's too costly,
watch out for him."

1223
01:38:17,800 --> 01:38:19,900
"His manure's too costly..."

1224
01:38:20,200 --> 01:38:22,300
There must be a code.

1225
01:38:36,400 --> 01:38:38,000
Your Mr. Pry called!

1226
01:38:38,600 --> 01:38:40,500
He's run into a dead-end in Saintes.

1227
01:38:40,800 --> 01:38:41,700
I know!

1228
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:54,400
Hello! Go ahead.

1229
01:38:55,500 --> 01:38:57,500
Yes, Miss. I remember you.

1230
01:38:58,100 --> 01:39:01,700
Old Bernay? No, never heard of him.

1231
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:04,800
Benoît Notre Dame
used the manure from his animals.

1232
01:39:05,100 --> 01:39:06,600
He never bought it!

1233
01:39:07,100 --> 01:39:08,500
Thank you, Father.

1234
01:39:10,500 --> 01:39:12,100
I must decode this letter.

1235
01:39:13,300 --> 01:39:14,900
I think we're getting hot.

1236
01:39:49,700 --> 01:39:52,200
Will be - Bernay - March

1237
01:39:52,500 --> 01:39:53,700
Sell - Everything

1238
01:39:53,900 --> 01:39:55,000
Say - Nothing

1239
01:39:55,300 --> 01:39:57,300
Listen - No one

1240
01:39:58,000 --> 01:39:58,800
Benoît

1241
01:40:47,800 --> 01:40:50,400
Excuse me,
the "End of the World" farm?

1242
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:53,100
The last house
at the end of the road.

1243
01:41:12,100 --> 01:41:13,500
And if he doesn't come?

1244
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:15,300
He'll come, don't worry.

1245
01:41:15,500 --> 01:41:17,000
Come back in two hours.

1246
01:41:47,200 --> 01:41:48,400
Hello, Mathilde.

1247
01:41:48,600 --> 01:41:51,000
It's dangerous
to want to bring back the dead.

1248
01:41:53,100 --> 01:41:55,300
When I saw your ad in the paper,

1249
01:41:55,800 --> 01:41:58,300
I knew, in time,
the gendarmes would come.

1250
01:42:00,100 --> 01:42:01,100
Don't worry.

1251
01:42:01,800 --> 01:42:03,900
I had the chance
to do away with you...

1252
01:42:04,200 --> 01:42:05,500
I let it go.

1253
01:42:30,700 --> 01:42:33,800
We knew you were a thief.
But a pyromaniac?

1254
01:42:34,100 --> 01:42:35,700
I couldn't kill you.

1255
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,800
Now, even the rabbits and chickens,
my wife has to do it.

1256
01:42:39,100 --> 01:42:40,600
The war's taken it out of me.

1257
01:42:40,800 --> 01:42:42,500
You know what I want to hear.

1258
01:42:43,600 --> 01:42:44,700
Is he alive?

1259
01:42:48,600 --> 01:42:50,700
The last time I saw him,
he wasn't doing well.

1260
01:42:52,100 --> 01:42:53,500
But he's stronger than he looks.

1261
01:43:04,300 --> 01:43:05,400
Don't stay together.

1262
01:43:24,200 --> 01:43:27,300
When things calmed down,
I tried to get some sleep.

1263
01:43:27,800 --> 01:43:30,400
- Gaignard!
- You think we're at the whorehouse?

1264
01:43:30,600 --> 01:43:32,200
- Bouquet!
- What now?

1265
01:43:32,500 --> 01:43:33,800
Notre Dame?

1266
01:43:40,600 --> 01:43:42,800
Then the pimp tried to surrender.

1267
01:43:43,100 --> 01:43:45,400
And the welder
from Paris was killed.

1268
01:43:47,700 --> 01:43:49,800
Your fiancé started carving
on the tree.

1269
01:43:50,500 --> 01:43:52,500
Then, the Jerries' Albatross arrived.

1270
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,500
I came to,
when the ground started shaking.

1271
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:28,400
I don't know what happened.
I just saw that trapdoor

1272
01:44:28,700 --> 01:44:30,000
the shell had half-opened.

1273
01:44:47,100 --> 01:44:48,200
For France!

1274
01:44:48,500 --> 01:44:49,700
Charge!

1275
01:45:01,100 --> 01:45:03,800
They entered no-man's-land.
At the second German line,

1276
01:45:04,500 --> 01:45:07,500
the machine guns got them.
A few hours later,

1277
01:45:07,900 --> 01:45:09,400
a voice woke me.

1278
01:45:10,900 --> 01:45:13,300
My God! Bastoche is dead!

1279
01:45:13,700 --> 01:45:14,800
We can't leave him here.

1280
01:45:15,100 --> 01:45:17,000
We'll come back.
He's not going anywhere.

1281
01:45:17,400 --> 01:45:18,800
Bastoche is dead.

1282
01:45:21,700 --> 01:45:23,600
Look, this one's still moving.

1283
01:45:23,900 --> 01:45:26,000
It's the Cornflower.
He's a goner as well.

1284
01:45:42,800 --> 01:45:44,400
A shell had ripped the door off.

1285
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:46,900
One of the guys arrived,
in bad shape.

1286
01:45:47,100 --> 01:45:48,500
Bastoche is dead!

1287
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:56,600
We're all going to die.

1288
01:45:58,200 --> 01:45:59,300
I recognized Bastoche's friend.

1289
01:45:59,400 --> 01:46:01,900
The one who'd taken
his German boots.

1290
01:46:13,500 --> 01:46:15,800
After eating, I smoked his tobacco.

1291
01:46:16,600 --> 01:46:18,100
Then, I heard more voices.

1292
01:46:18,500 --> 01:46:19,800
Let's go look over there.

1293
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:22,000
Look here!

1294
01:46:22,700 --> 01:46:23,800
Damn it!

1295
01:46:25,900 --> 01:46:27,200
It's not the Cornflower.

1296
01:46:31,900 --> 01:46:33,400
What's he doing in there?

1297
01:46:35,100 --> 01:46:36,600
Where's the Dordogne farmer?

1298
01:47:58,500 --> 01:48:00,600
- I'm cold.
- Don't worry.

1299
01:48:20,400 --> 01:48:21,900
He was really messed up,

1300
01:48:22,700 --> 01:48:25,300
but your fiancé wanted to live.
I saw it in his eyes.

1301
01:48:29,900 --> 01:48:32,600
I put him on my shoulders
and set off through the trench.

1302
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:38,500
He was burning with fever.

1303
01:48:39,400 --> 01:48:41,200
I felt the heat on my back.

1304
01:48:42,800 --> 01:48:44,600
And he was delirious.

1305
01:48:46,200 --> 01:48:47,900
Spoke of a heart
beating in his hand.

1306
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:56,100
Hey, Corporal!

1307
01:48:56,500 --> 01:48:58,400
Only 500 yards to the hospital.

1308
01:48:58,700 --> 01:49:00,600
Want us to put your friend
on the stretcher?

1309
01:49:00,900 --> 01:49:01,800
No, thanks.

1310
01:49:02,100 --> 01:49:04,300
If you see any officers from Bingo,

1311
01:49:04,600 --> 01:49:09,100
tell them Corporal Gordes has gone
to the hospital with Desrochelles.

1312
01:49:09,300 --> 01:49:10,600
Have it your way!

1313
01:49:11,400 --> 01:49:13,300
I arrived just before the explosion.

1314
01:49:13,600 --> 01:49:16,200
Headquarters had the good idea
of setting up hospital

1315
01:49:16,400 --> 01:49:19,200
in a hangar containing
a hydrogen-packed zeppelin.

1316
01:49:25,800 --> 01:49:28,500
The Cornflower
has just been evacuated.

1317
01:49:30,600 --> 01:49:31,700
Will he make it?

1318
01:49:32,600 --> 01:49:36,700
His hip wound isn't too bad. But
he has a severe case of pneumonia.

1319
01:49:38,300 --> 01:49:41,400
You're both registered
according to your tag numbers.

1320
01:49:41,700 --> 01:49:44,800
I don't want to know anything else.
But good luck anyway!

1321
01:50:32,600 --> 01:50:33,800
Block the pulley!

1322
01:51:07,800 --> 01:51:08,900
Please!

1323
01:51:39,100 --> 01:51:41,600
After that, I walked to Bernay.

1324
01:51:42,400 --> 01:51:44,900
I had no idea if my wife
had received my letter,

1325
01:51:45,100 --> 01:51:47,800
so each day I waited for her
at the bus-stop.

1326
01:51:54,600 --> 01:51:57,500
With the money from the sale,
we bought a farm here.

1327
01:51:58,400 --> 01:52:00,600
The most isolated one we could find.

1328
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:03,300
They call it "The End of the World".

1329
01:52:11,200 --> 01:52:12,200
That's it.

1330
01:52:15,500 --> 01:52:16,500
Goodbye.

1331
01:52:20,600 --> 01:52:21,600
How strange.

1332
01:52:22,600 --> 01:52:25,000
You shot a hole
right through your lifeline.

1333
01:52:25,500 --> 01:52:26,800
Of course.

1334
01:52:27,200 --> 01:52:30,300
I died. At Bingo Crépuscule,
like your fiancé.

1335
01:52:38,100 --> 01:52:41,100
If ever you find
Jean Desrochelles alive somewhere,

1336
01:52:41,500 --> 01:52:42,800
let me know.

1337
01:52:43,300 --> 01:52:44,600
You know where to find me.

1338
01:52:56,600 --> 01:52:57,600
Make yourself at home!

1339
01:52:57,800 --> 01:52:59,600
At Christmas,
come down the chimney!

1340
01:52:59,800 --> 01:53:01,000
For Miss Mathilde.

1341
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:03,700
I'll give it to her later.

1342
01:53:04,200 --> 01:53:05,600
If I were you...

1343
01:53:06,100 --> 01:53:07,600
I would wake her up.

1344
01:53:12,900 --> 01:53:14,000
What is it?

1345
01:53:31,400 --> 01:53:32,500
"He's alive.

1346
01:53:34,300 --> 01:53:36,000
"Stay where you are, Mathilde.

1347
01:53:36,300 --> 01:53:38,100
"Just stay where you are.

1348
01:53:38,500 --> 01:53:39,700
"I'm on my way.

1349
01:53:40,100 --> 01:53:41,500
"Germain Pire."

1350
01:53:49,200 --> 01:53:50,900
How silly I am!

1351
01:54:12,700 --> 01:54:15,600
Peerless on the prowl,
faster than a whippet!

1352
01:54:16,200 --> 01:54:19,400
He's well and truly alive,
but he's lost his memory!

1353
01:54:19,700 --> 01:54:24,100
Total amnesia. He even had to learn
to read and write again.

1354
01:54:24,500 --> 01:54:28,400
The psychiatrists treating him
since '17 aren't hopeful.

1355
01:54:28,800 --> 01:54:30,300
But who knows?

1356
01:54:30,600 --> 01:54:34,500
There are as many amnesias
as amnesiacs.

1357
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:35,900
Where is he?

1358
01:54:36,200 --> 01:54:37,500
In Milly-la-Forêt.

1359
01:54:37,900 --> 01:54:41,800
Orphaned for the second time.
He's just lost his adopted mother.

1360
01:54:45,400 --> 01:54:48,100
Pierre-Marie, do you know Mr. Pire?

1361
01:54:48,700 --> 01:54:49,900
By reputation.

1362
01:54:50,200 --> 01:54:51,200
An honour.

1363
01:54:53,400 --> 01:54:55,600
Mathilde,
I'll believe it when I see it.

1364
01:54:56,100 --> 01:54:57,200
"With my own eyes!"

1365
01:54:57,700 --> 01:54:59,400
When Jean Desrochelles was born,

1366
01:54:59,900 --> 01:55:02,000
his mother was 40,
and had no other children.

1367
01:55:02,300 --> 01:55:03,900
When the gendarmes took him...

1368
01:55:04,200 --> 01:55:06,200
To replenish the troops in Ardennes.

1369
01:55:06,500 --> 01:55:07,900
She became depressed.

1370
01:55:08,300 --> 01:55:11,000
One day,
a comrade of her son visited her...

1371
01:55:11,500 --> 01:55:12,500
Chardolot!

1372
01:55:13,800 --> 01:55:15,600
Unfortunately, it was Jean.

1373
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:20,300
A shell had got him. He'd already
been dead for a few hours.

1374
01:55:21,900 --> 01:55:23,300
I should also tell you...

1375
01:55:24,800 --> 01:55:27,800
Maybe the youngest prisoner
has taken Jean's identity...

1376
01:55:30,500 --> 01:55:32,000
exchanging tag numbers.

1377
01:55:35,800 --> 01:55:39,000
She went off her rocker
the day the hospital rang her,

1378
01:55:39,700 --> 01:55:42,400
asking to come to her son's bedside.

1379
01:55:44,800 --> 01:55:46,800
He's sleeping. I'll leave you.

1380
01:56:09,300 --> 01:56:10,600
Who are you?

1381
01:56:11,200 --> 01:56:13,000
Your mother, my darling.

1382
01:56:14,700 --> 01:56:16,200
I'm your mother.

1383
01:56:17,400 --> 01:56:19,000
I ran my own little investigation.

1384
01:56:19,500 --> 01:56:21,400
Mrs. Desrochelles died
two months ago.

1385
01:56:21,600 --> 01:56:24,300
Run over by a truck
after a fight with a shopkeeper.

1386
01:56:24,500 --> 01:56:26,000
And I'm not guessing!

1387
01:56:26,800 --> 01:56:29,000
- It's in the report.
- We already knew that.

1388
01:56:34,900 --> 01:56:36,500
Don't get upset.

1389
01:56:37,100 --> 01:56:40,600
Mrs. Desrochelles didn't suffer,
she died straight away.

1390
01:56:40,800 --> 01:56:42,100
It's not that.

1391
01:56:42,800 --> 01:56:44,400
I feel so guilty!

1392
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:48,600
I didn't believe you,
my dear Mathilde!

1393
01:56:48,800 --> 01:56:50,400
I should have known!

1394
01:56:51,200 --> 01:56:52,700
I'm so sorry.

1395
01:56:59,800 --> 01:57:02,800
In what she would refer to as
her "Milly Expedition",

1396
01:57:03,100 --> 01:57:06,500
the sun, the sky
and nature are with her.

1397
01:57:06,700 --> 01:57:10,000
As a true lady, she made
every effort to look her best.

1398
01:57:10,500 --> 01:57:12,200
Dressed in white for freshness,

1399
01:57:12,500 --> 01:57:15,900
lipstick for the occasion,
eyebrows shaped.

1400
01:57:16,100 --> 01:57:18,800
But none of that black
which lengthens the eyelashes.

1401
01:57:19,100 --> 01:57:21,200
She knows that tears
can make a mess of it.

1402
01:57:41,800 --> 01:57:43,600
He knows about your visit.

1403
01:57:43,800 --> 01:57:46,900
We said a young girl
he'd dearly loved was coming here.

1404
01:57:47,300 --> 01:57:49,800
He asked your name
and found it very beautiful.

1405
01:57:50,400 --> 01:57:52,800
He's in the garden.
He's waiting for you.

1406
01:59:56,100 --> 01:59:57,700
Does it hurt when you walk?

1407
02:00:05,900 --> 02:00:07,300
Want to see what I'm doing?

1408
02:00:20,100 --> 02:00:22,200
I'll show you later,
when it's finished.

1409
02:00:28,900 --> 02:00:30,200
But why are you crying?

1410
02:00:35,900 --> 02:00:38,700
Mathilde leans back
against her chair,

1411
02:00:39,600 --> 02:00:43,000
folds her hands in her lap
and looks at him.

1412
02:00:43,700 --> 02:00:47,700
In the sweetness of the air,
in the light of the garden,

1413
02:00:48,500 --> 02:00:50,100
Mathilde looks at him.

1414
02:00:50,800 --> 02:00:52,400
She looks at him...

1415
02:00:52,900 --> 02:00:54,200
She looks at him...
