1
00:00:00,135 --> 00:00:03,104
Cut it off. Please.

2
00:00:03,505 --> 00:00:05,803
Please!

3
00:00:05,974 --> 00:00:07,908
Cut it off.

4
00:00:08,076 --> 00:00:10,476
Please.

5
00:00:12,114 --> 00:00:15,709
- Aren't you full of surprises?
- Yeah.

6
00:00:24,059 --> 00:00:25,321
Yeah.

7
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:32,560
Yes.

8
00:00:36,638 --> 00:00:37,969
You're beautiful.

9
00:00:40,308 --> 00:00:42,674
Open your eyes so I know
you hear me.

10
00:00:44,946 --> 00:00:46,641
Beautiful.

11
00:01:03,999 --> 00:01:05,694
What about birth control?

12
00:01:06,334 --> 00:01:08,131
Menopause.

13
00:01:09,037 --> 00:01:11,164
Who's the lucky boy?

14
00:01:15,644 --> 00:01:18,511
Okay. Okay.

15
00:01:33,395 --> 00:01:35,522
I think we should take
your blood pressure.

16
00:01:36,765 --> 00:01:40,166
- My blood pressure?
- I think it's irresponsible not to.

17
00:01:44,039 --> 00:01:48,408
- Nobody but you would stop...
- Yeah, so you're lucky.

18
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:50,903
Oh, God, I can't...
I can't see.

19
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:53,138
- My glasses.
- Okay.

20
00:01:56,184 --> 00:01:59,711
120l80! Oh, baby!

21
00:02:07,162 --> 00:02:08,754
Oh, my God.

22
00:02:08,964 --> 00:02:11,865
I do like sex.

23
00:02:14,736 --> 00:02:18,604
- You certainly do.
- Wow!

24
00:02:19,574 --> 00:02:22,134
Oh, God.

25
00:02:24,379 --> 00:02:28,315
So this is what you're supposed to do
on a rainy afternoon, huh?

26
00:02:36,424 --> 00:02:38,551
I really thought I was...

27
00:02:39,494 --> 00:02:42,554
...sort of closed up for business.

28
00:02:43,698 --> 00:02:46,633
I never expected this.

29
00:02:56,511 --> 00:03:00,106
Nothing's ever surprised me more.

30
00:03:03,852 --> 00:03:06,377
This is crazy.

31
00:03:08,256 --> 00:03:11,953
I can't remember
the last time I cried. I...

32
00:03:12,627 --> 00:03:15,960
I think I'm overwhelmed.

33
00:03:20,235 --> 00:03:21,497
Me too.

34
00:03:23,305 --> 00:03:25,739
That's the perfect word.

35
00:03:26,174 --> 00:03:31,009
Baby, I had sex three days
after a heart attack, and I didn't die.

36
00:03:31,179 --> 00:03:34,342
That's gotta be some kind of a record.

37
00:03:35,917 --> 00:03:37,179
Yeah.

38
00:03:42,657 --> 00:03:46,286
Let's just not brag about this
to your doctor, okay?

39
00:03:47,963 --> 00:03:49,692
Honey.

40
00:03:50,198 --> 00:03:54,157
I may not be many things,
but one thing I am is discreet.

41
00:03:54,336 --> 00:03:56,065
Yeah.

42
00:03:59,007 --> 00:04:01,066
Erica?

43
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:04,741
Erica.

44
00:04:04,913 --> 00:04:06,505
Yeah?

45
00:04:08,216 --> 00:04:10,207
Erica?

46
00:04:11,286 --> 00:04:15,052
You know I'm not good
at being monogamous, right?

47
00:04:16,358 --> 00:04:18,553
Monogamous?

48
00:04:18,727 --> 00:04:22,561
Please. I hardly know you.

49
00:04:44,019 --> 00:04:45,714
But why Paris?

50
00:04:45,887 --> 00:04:48,856
I just always wanted to
write a play that ended there.

51
00:04:49,024 --> 00:04:52,551
People need that romance, and if
someone like me doesn't write it...

52
00:04:52,727 --> 00:04:56,857
...where will they get it? Real life?
- Excuse me?

53
00:04:57,032 --> 00:04:59,296
What do you call this?

54
00:04:59,567 --> 00:05:04,470
Eating eggs by candlelight,
in our robes...

55
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,800
...after...

56
00:05:07,609 --> 00:05:09,042
Sorry.

57
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:11,701
So where do you like to eat in Paris?

58
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,246
I love this bistro called
The Grand Colbert.

59
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:19,080
It's behind the Palais-Royal. It's the
best roast chicken in the universe.

60
00:05:19,921 --> 00:05:22,890
You'd be fun to go to Paris with.

61
00:05:23,058 --> 00:05:25,891
It is the best city
to stay up all night in.

62
00:05:26,061 --> 00:05:28,461
Hey, when is your birthday?

63
00:05:29,164 --> 00:05:31,496
- February.
- Well, mine's January.

64
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:35,102
So how about if we still know
each other by then, we go to Paris...

65
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:37,431
...for our birthdays, huh?

66
00:05:37,872 --> 00:05:39,567
Maybe.

67
00:05:43,378 --> 00:05:47,075
You just said... You know something,
I have no idea how to do this.

68
00:05:47,248 --> 00:05:50,979
I don't know how to be intimate
but not intimate.

69
00:05:53,722 --> 00:05:58,159
The color is draining from your face.

70
00:05:58,626 --> 00:06:02,528
Okay, I'm gonna pee, take one of
your blood-pressure pills...

71
00:06:02,697 --> 00:06:05,495
...and when I get back,
let's not talk anymore.

72
00:06:09,237 --> 00:06:11,137
Erica.

73
00:06:11,473 --> 00:06:15,170
You're the funniest girl
I ever had sex with.

74
00:06:17,245 --> 00:06:20,442
Well, that's something.

75
00:06:20,949 --> 00:06:23,349
Honey.

76
00:06:23,618 --> 00:06:26,086
I think I should go back to my room.

77
00:06:26,421 --> 00:06:29,515
- Let you get some sleep.
- Let me sleep?

78
00:06:29,691 --> 00:06:31,158
Yeah.

79
00:06:33,728 --> 00:06:35,252
Right.

80
00:06:35,797 --> 00:06:38,595
You usually send the girls home.

81
00:06:40,769 --> 00:06:42,430
But I am home.

82
00:06:42,604 --> 00:06:46,005
- Okay.
- Well, I'm an old dog, you know?

83
00:06:46,174 --> 00:06:47,436
Hey.

84
00:06:48,343 --> 00:06:51,210
It's perfectly... Whatever.

85
00:06:59,354 --> 00:07:01,413
This was...

86
00:07:04,559 --> 00:07:06,618
This was...

87
00:07:07,328 --> 00:07:09,523
...a great night...

88
00:07:10,732 --> 00:07:12,427
...for me.

89
00:07:16,905 --> 00:07:18,532
Me too.

90
00:07:18,706 --> 00:07:20,298
Yeah?

91
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:24,244
At one point...

92
00:07:24,445 --> 00:07:26,913
...I even thought...

93
00:07:29,818 --> 00:07:31,479
...soul mates.

94
00:07:40,395 --> 00:07:41,657
Good night.

95
00:08:32,013 --> 00:08:35,073
I'd like to try sleeping with you.

96
00:09:35,977 --> 00:09:37,706
Oh, my God!

97
00:09:41,215 --> 00:09:42,682
Hi.

98
00:09:45,186 --> 00:09:47,882
What time do you think it is?

99
00:09:57,832 --> 00:10:00,198
Can you see this?

100
00:10:00,835 --> 00:10:03,804
Not really. It looks like it says...

101
00:10:04,439 --> 00:10:06,373
...11?

102
00:10:10,545 --> 00:10:12,604
- It is 11.
- It is?

103
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:15,840
No way. It can't be.

104
00:10:16,084 --> 00:10:18,518
Oh, my God, that would mean
we slept eight hours?

105
00:10:22,156 --> 00:10:25,614
- Impossible.
- Yeah.

106
00:10:26,294 --> 00:10:27,989
Oh, Nellie.

107
00:10:30,264 --> 00:10:31,959
A little dizzy.

108
00:10:32,133 --> 00:10:34,863
Oh, no. Okay, now, you just...

109
00:10:35,036 --> 00:10:38,403
You just stay still.
There you go. Here's the clicker.

110
00:10:38,573 --> 00:10:40,768
You have a doctor's appointment
in an hour.

111
00:10:40,942 --> 00:10:43,410
I'll make us some coffee,
get you your pills...

112
00:10:43,578 --> 00:10:48,208
...whip us up some french toast.
I have the best maple syrup ever.

113
00:10:49,684 --> 00:10:51,276
Erica.

114
00:10:53,588 --> 00:10:56,682
You are a woman to love.

115
00:11:09,203 --> 00:11:11,103
"You are..."

116
00:11:11,272 --> 00:11:14,264
"You are a woman to love."

117
00:11:15,309 --> 00:11:17,709
What the hell does that mean?

118
00:11:19,313 --> 00:11:22,282
Okay, buddy, your echo
looks real good.

119
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:24,975
I'm sending you back to the city.

120
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,711
Past few days
have done wonders for you.

121
00:11:28,389 --> 00:11:32,348
Yeah, I've been working on
that stair thing.

122
00:11:32,927 --> 00:11:34,588
I can do it, by the way.

123
00:11:34,762 --> 00:11:36,559
Do what?

124
00:11:36,864 --> 00:11:39,560
Climb a flight of stairs.

125
00:11:39,734 --> 00:11:42,294
Several times, actually.

126
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:44,301
Way to go.

127
00:11:45,106 --> 00:11:47,904
So how's Erica?

128
00:11:48,076 --> 00:11:50,806
Erica, as it turns out...

129
00:11:50,978 --> 00:11:52,843
...is an amazing woman.

130
00:11:53,181 --> 00:11:55,411
- She's just...
- Well, that's wonderful.

131
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:57,073
I think she's wonderful.

132
00:11:57,785 --> 00:12:00,413
I think she's wonderful too.

133
00:12:02,056 --> 00:12:04,047
Give her my best.

134
00:12:11,299 --> 00:12:13,426
Julian?

135
00:12:13,601 --> 00:12:15,501
Thank you...

136
00:12:16,237 --> 00:12:18,364
...for everything.

137
00:12:22,343 --> 00:12:23,867
You're gonna be okay.

138
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:27,514
I am?

139
00:12:28,483 --> 00:12:30,974
This is the second time
I've done this.

140
00:12:31,152 --> 00:12:35,816
I get overcome or something.
It's so out of the blue.

141
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:40,324
It's common to become emotional
after having an episode like you had.

142
00:12:40,795 --> 00:12:42,763
Everything takes on a new meaning.

143
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:45,922
So it's not crazy for a guy
to do something...

144
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:51,231
...so totally out of character
after having a heart attack.

145
00:12:51,506 --> 00:12:52,905
You mean like crying?

146
00:12:53,307 --> 00:12:55,207
Yeah.

147
00:12:56,377 --> 00:12:58,641
And completely changing their taste.

148
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:01,314
Like, suddenly...

149
00:13:01,482 --> 00:13:06,283
...really liking something that you
never thought you could ever like.

150
00:13:07,255 --> 00:13:09,485
Ever.

151
00:13:09,657 --> 00:13:13,525
- It's unnerving.
- You can expect anything right now.

152
00:13:13,694 --> 00:13:16,788
People have done some wild things
after having a heart attack.

153
00:13:16,964 --> 00:13:19,797
But most people go back to
being themselves, right?

154
00:13:19,967 --> 00:13:23,232
I'm gonna go back to being me...

155
00:13:24,138 --> 00:13:25,537
...aren't I?

156
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,008
We'll see.

157
00:13:41,322 --> 00:13:44,120
Here you go.
You can have these back now.

158
00:13:44,492 --> 00:13:48,053
I confiscated them
on your first night here.

159
00:13:51,098 --> 00:13:54,329
- Thank you, darling.
- Try not to smoke them.

160
00:13:54,802 --> 00:13:58,329
And I packed you a sandwich,
just in case your blood sugar got low...

161
00:13:58,506 --> 00:14:02,738
...and some of that iced tea you like,
a low-cholesterol cookie and a peach.

162
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:04,901
What a doll.

163
00:14:07,281 --> 00:14:09,374
Got something else?

164
00:14:11,085 --> 00:14:13,645
Something to remember me by.

165
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:38,178
- There is that.
- And, hey...

166
00:14:38,646 --> 00:14:40,307
...we'll always have Paris.

167
00:14:43,517 --> 00:14:44,779
Bad joke.

168
00:14:44,952 --> 00:14:47,443
- Honey?
- Yeah?

169
00:14:48,856 --> 00:14:52,451
No words can ever
express my gratitude...

170
00:14:53,928 --> 00:14:56,328
...for taking me in...

171
00:14:56,797 --> 00:15:01,325
...and taking care of me and...
- Hey. Your heart attack...

172
00:15:01,502 --> 00:15:04,369
...could be the best thing
that ever happened to me.

173
00:15:11,112 --> 00:15:14,445
- I love ya.
- I love you too.

174
00:15:15,049 --> 00:15:16,812
If that's what you said.

175
00:15:16,984 --> 00:15:20,852
I don't know if it ends in a "ya"
if it's an official "I love you," but...

176
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:25,616
You're not like anybody.

177
00:15:47,214 --> 00:15:49,409
- I knew you'd call.
- Who? It's me.

178
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:51,551
- What's wrong?
- Had breakfast with Dad.

179
00:15:51,719 --> 00:15:54,688
We're talking, and he starts
looking weird and tells me...

180
00:15:54,855 --> 00:15:58,018
...he met someone three weeks ago,
that it's really something.

181
00:15:58,192 --> 00:15:59,887
And then he...

182
00:16:00,061 --> 00:16:02,188
He tells me he's getting married.

183
00:16:02,363 --> 00:16:05,196
Why am I reacting this way?
I'm almost 30 years old.

184
00:16:05,366 --> 00:16:07,834
- Wait, wait. Who is he marrying?
- I don't know.

185
00:16:08,002 --> 00:16:11,733
Some chick he met three weeks ago.
She's two years older than me.

186
00:16:11,906 --> 00:16:16,036
She's an ear, nose and throat
doctor. Has he lost his mind?

187
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:18,303
- Honey...
- I have a huge auction tonight...

188
00:16:18,479 --> 00:16:21,448
...and I'm really upset.
My shrink's away for two weeks.

189
00:16:21,615 --> 00:16:25,551
Can you come in? I know
you're working, but just, please?

190
00:16:30,091 --> 00:16:33,788
I get that he has a right to get
remarried, but he doesn't know her.

191
00:16:33,961 --> 00:16:36,088
She's my age.
Do you know what that's like?

192
00:16:36,263 --> 00:16:38,026
That's, like, beyond creepy.

193
00:16:38,199 --> 00:16:41,100
It's not like I think he's
replacing me. I know he isn't.

194
00:16:41,268 --> 00:16:43,736
I know I'm too old
to act like this, it's nuts.

195
00:16:43,904 --> 00:16:45,769
First of all, please don't smoke.

196
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:50,377
If he is replacing anyone, it's me,
not you. And all the statistics say...

197
00:16:50,544 --> 00:16:53,342
...divorced men always remarry.
It's how they're built.

198
00:16:53,514 --> 00:16:56,574
Wanna know why I'm always
with the wrong guy?

199
00:16:56,751 --> 00:16:59,618
This is why. Because the wrong guy
can't do this to you.

200
00:16:59,787 --> 00:17:02,654
This is my big fear,
that some guy can get me...

201
00:17:02,823 --> 00:17:06,088
...unglued like this.
And this is just Dad!

202
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:10,219
We know this about me. I am just
not cut out for this kind of drama.

203
00:17:10,398 --> 00:17:13,060
I think it's the drama in
life that makes you strong.

204
00:17:13,234 --> 00:17:15,168
You always say things to me like this.

205
00:17:15,336 --> 00:17:18,897
You never understand
that everyone isn't like you.

206
00:17:19,907 --> 00:17:24,071
If I were you, and my ex-husband,
the man I allow to direct my plays...

207
00:17:24,245 --> 00:17:26,770
...were getting remarried
to some 33-year-old...

208
00:17:26,947 --> 00:17:31,145
...ear, nose and throat babe,
I'd be bonkers. And look at you.

209
00:17:31,318 --> 00:17:35,277
- You never looked better, by the way.
- Oh, well...

210
00:17:35,456 --> 00:17:36,821
Marin, we're all set.

211
00:17:37,291 --> 00:17:40,317
I gotta go sell $40 million
worth of art.

212
00:17:40,494 --> 00:17:43,554
Can you do one other big thing
for me? Just say yes, just...

213
00:17:43,731 --> 00:17:45,460
- Please?
- Anything, bubby.

214
00:17:45,766 --> 00:17:48,929
I need you to come out to dinner
with me, Dad and the fiancée.

215
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:52,303
- Absolutely not. No.
- Mom, you have to.

216
00:17:52,473 --> 00:17:53,770
Hey. You have to.

217
00:17:53,941 --> 00:17:56,967
Yes, because he wants me
to meet her. I can't go alone.

218
00:17:57,144 --> 00:18:00,136
I asked them if you could come,
and they said it was fine.

219
00:18:00,581 --> 00:18:03,744
You're gonna have to meet her too,
so we should do it together.

220
00:18:03,918 --> 00:18:06,148
Come on. Please?

221
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,652
You know you can handle it.

222
00:18:08,856 --> 00:18:10,153
Well...

223
00:18:11,125 --> 00:18:14,458
Okay, that's it. You see that
look on your face?

224
00:18:14,628 --> 00:18:17,358
That's the gene I didn't get.

225
00:18:18,032 --> 00:18:22,025
Welcome to Christie's and tonight's
sale of impressionist and modern art.

226
00:18:22,203 --> 00:18:25,536
The auctioneer may open bidding
on any lot below the reserve...

227
00:18:25,706 --> 00:18:29,642
...by bidding on behalf of the seller.
Let's start with lot number one...

228
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:34,008
...the Renard, showing here.
$80,000 is bid with my absent bidder.

229
00:18:34,181 --> 00:18:38,140
$85,000, gentleman's bid.
$90,000, still with me.

230
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:40,753
$ 100,000. $ 110,000.

231
00:18:44,592 --> 00:18:48,255
$ 140,000, gentleman's bid.
And fair warning.

232
00:19:00,808 --> 00:19:02,742
Guess I got stood up.

233
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:05,071
Would you like to order or...?

234
00:19:05,246 --> 00:19:08,306
Why not? I put the tie on
and everything.

235
00:19:08,482 --> 00:19:09,847
Can you bring me another?

236
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,959
Your drink, ma'am.

237
00:19:21,128 --> 00:19:23,096
Oh, good. Thank you so much.

238
00:19:23,497 --> 00:19:25,795
So delicious.

239
00:19:28,602 --> 00:19:30,467
- Thirsty?
- I've had a very big week.

240
00:19:30,638 --> 00:19:33,436
I forgot how these slip right down.
I'm fine.

241
00:19:33,607 --> 00:19:37,134
So, Kristen, where did you
go to medical...

242
00:19:37,878 --> 00:19:40,608
...school? Oh, I'm so sorry.

243
00:19:40,781 --> 00:19:42,373
University of Pennsylvania.

244
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:45,576
Well, actually, I went to school
in Philadelphia too.

245
00:19:45,753 --> 00:19:47,550
- Bryn Mawr girl.
- You're kidding.

246
00:19:47,721 --> 00:19:50,053
- My mom went to Bryn Mawr.
- Wow!

247
00:19:50,224 --> 00:19:53,785
Not only are you marrying my dad,
our moms went to the same college.

248
00:19:53,961 --> 00:19:55,986
- Shall we order?
- Absolutely.

249
00:19:56,163 --> 00:19:57,994
Erica? Do I like duck?

250
00:19:58,165 --> 00:20:00,030
Yes, it's rabbit you hate.

251
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,532
I'll give you a list of his likes
and dislikes.

252
00:20:02,703 --> 00:20:04,694
Let her figure things out for herself.

253
00:20:04,872 --> 00:20:08,638
I'm not talking about that, Dave.
After all, she did go to medical school.

254
00:20:08,809 --> 00:20:11,778
Hey, hey, hey.
Not in front of the kids.

255
00:20:13,614 --> 00:20:15,946
So, what do you see that you like?

256
00:20:16,116 --> 00:20:18,949
- What are you having?
- I don't know.

257
00:20:19,119 --> 00:20:22,020
You know,
I'm looking at the grilled salmon...

258
00:20:28,762 --> 00:20:31,925
- Who would like what?
- Mom, are you okay?

259
00:20:32,099 --> 00:20:34,795
- Sure you're okay?
- Yeah, no, I'm fine. I'm...

260
00:20:36,971 --> 00:20:38,529
- I'm fine.
- You sure?

261
00:20:38,706 --> 00:20:40,606
- Oh, yes.
- Good.

262
00:20:41,542 --> 00:20:44,477
If we wanted pasta,
we could get the fresh rigatoni.

263
00:20:44,645 --> 00:20:47,876
Grilled free-range chicken teriyaki...

264
00:20:48,649 --> 00:20:52,141
I'm not sure. What about you?

265
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,151
I'm sorry.
Maybe I need a little air.

266
00:20:55,322 --> 00:20:58,348
- Are you okay?
- Fine. I'll be right back.

267
00:21:01,028 --> 00:21:03,462
- Excuse me.
- I'm sorry.

268
00:21:03,631 --> 00:21:05,462
I...

269
00:21:07,468 --> 00:21:10,528
- Hey!
- Hello, Harry.

270
00:21:11,105 --> 00:21:12,970
Hi.

271
00:21:15,209 --> 00:21:18,201
- Hi.
- I don't know if you know...

272
00:21:29,423 --> 00:21:32,586
God, I'm so stupid.

273
00:21:34,528 --> 00:21:36,826
- What?
- Erica!

274
00:21:36,997 --> 00:21:39,659
- Harry, I gotta go.
- Slow down!

275
00:21:39,833 --> 00:21:41,767
You wanna kill me?

276
00:21:43,003 --> 00:21:44,595
Taxi.

277
00:21:44,772 --> 00:21:46,535
Erica.

278
00:21:46,707 --> 00:21:49,073
- She's just a friend.
- Oh, yeah.

279
00:21:49,243 --> 00:21:52,212
- She looks like a buddy kind of girl.
- Come on.

280
00:21:52,379 --> 00:21:54,939
- Just a dinner.
- Harry, look.

281
00:21:55,115 --> 00:21:57,140
Here's the problem.

282
00:21:58,318 --> 00:22:00,081
I really like you.

283
00:22:00,454 --> 00:22:03,548
- I really like you.
- Yeah, but I "love you" like you.

284
00:22:03,724 --> 00:22:06,215
I do, I love you.

285
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,637
I think that we should consider...

286
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:25,074
...maybe we're getting
ahead of ourselves.

287
00:22:25,245 --> 00:22:27,008
- Do you?
- Yeah.

288
00:22:27,181 --> 00:22:29,445
I am like the dumb girl
who doesn't get it.

289
00:22:29,616 --> 00:22:32,278
I've never been the dumb girl before.
It ain't great.

290
00:22:32,453 --> 00:22:34,284
Let's just calm down.

291
00:22:34,455 --> 00:22:36,980
I had these plans
before I even met you.

292
00:22:37,157 --> 00:22:40,456
- I mean, I do like seeing you. I do.
- Yeah.

293
00:22:40,627 --> 00:22:43,790
- I'm always surprised by it.
- Surprised by it?

294
00:22:43,964 --> 00:22:46,057
What was I thinking?

295
00:22:46,233 --> 00:22:48,997
I have never lied to you.

296
00:22:49,169 --> 00:22:52,935
I have always told you
some version of the truth.

297
00:22:53,107 --> 00:22:56,167
The truth doesn't have versions, okay?

298
00:22:56,343 --> 00:22:59,107
Will you cut me a little slack?

299
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:02,476
- My life has been turned upside down.
- Mine too!

300
00:23:02,649 --> 00:23:05,174
Well, then let's just each
get our bearings.

301
00:23:05,352 --> 00:23:06,819
I don't want my bearings.

302
00:23:06,987 --> 00:23:11,083
I've had my bearings
my whole goddamn life.

303
00:23:11,458 --> 00:23:14,894
I felt something with you
that I never really knew existed.

304
00:23:15,062 --> 00:23:18,054
Do you know what that's like,
after a 20-year marriage...

305
00:23:18,232 --> 00:23:21,326
...to feel something
for another person that is so...?

306
00:23:21,969 --> 00:23:23,596
That...

307
00:23:25,572 --> 00:23:27,836
Right. Right. Not your problem.

308
00:23:28,442 --> 00:23:32,708
God. Do you know that
I've written this, but I never...

309
00:23:32,913 --> 00:23:34,904
...really got it.

310
00:23:35,649 --> 00:23:37,207
Do you know what this is?

311
00:23:37,985 --> 00:23:39,543
No.

312
00:23:50,397 --> 00:23:53,992
This is heartbroken.
How's that for impervious?

313
00:23:54,468 --> 00:23:56,663
You're killing me.

314
00:23:57,171 --> 00:24:01,437
I just wish that it had lasted
more than a week.

315
00:24:02,543 --> 00:24:04,010
Me too.

316
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:09,476
That is a terrible thing to say.

317
00:24:10,717 --> 00:24:13,686
You know, the life
I had before you...

318
00:24:14,121 --> 00:24:17,818
...I knew how to do that.
I could do that forever.

319
00:24:18,792 --> 00:24:22,023
But now look at me.
What am I gonna do?

320
00:24:22,196 --> 00:24:23,857
What am I gonna do with all this?

321
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,197
Taxi.

322
00:24:28,602 --> 00:24:31,469
Erica. Can you wait just a second?

323
00:24:32,272 --> 00:24:35,867
The truth is, I...
I just...

324
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:39,770
I don't know how to be a boyfriend.

325
00:24:40,781 --> 00:24:42,681
That's what you have to say?

326
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:45,478
That you don't know how to be
a boyfriend?

327
00:24:46,587 --> 00:24:49,522
That's not a small thing.

328
00:24:52,292 --> 00:24:53,953
Are we done?

329
00:24:55,162 --> 00:24:57,027
I don't know.

330
00:24:59,666 --> 00:25:01,031
Oh, my God.

331
00:25:09,076 --> 00:25:10,600
Ouch.

332
00:25:12,579 --> 00:25:14,547
Oh, my God.

333
00:25:15,182 --> 00:25:17,150
Came in via cab.

334
00:25:17,784 --> 00:25:20,753
Vital signs are stable.
Respiratory is on its way.

335
00:25:20,921 --> 00:25:23,754
Chest pain, hospitalized
a week ago with an MI.

336
00:25:24,057 --> 00:25:26,491
- Switch over to monitors.
- Hang a nitro drip.

337
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,621
You can't.

338
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:32,598
I took Viagra.

339
00:25:32,766 --> 00:25:34,700
You have been through this before.

340
00:25:34,868 --> 00:25:38,065
Let's run a 12-lead EKG.
You having chest pain right now?

341
00:25:38,238 --> 00:25:42,197
No. And the pain
I was having was sharp...

342
00:25:42,376 --> 00:25:43,809
...not like before.
- Good.

343
00:25:43,977 --> 00:25:46,241
"Not like before"
is what we like to hear.

344
00:25:46,524 --> 00:25:48,719
I was really out of breath...

345
00:25:48,893 --> 00:25:51,361
...like I couldn't catch it.

346
00:25:51,529 --> 00:25:54,555
Okay. Give him an aspirin,
and let's run a blood gas.

347
00:25:54,832 --> 00:25:57,858
Mr. Sanborn, what were you doing
at the onset of the pain?

348
00:25:58,036 --> 00:26:01,062
Having a fight with someone.
A woman.

349
00:26:01,239 --> 00:26:04,208
- Can a woman give you chest pains?
- Are you kidding?

350
00:26:04,375 --> 00:26:06,900
- Love hurts, haven't you heard?
- I've heard.

351
00:26:07,078 --> 00:26:09,569
I just never personally experienced it.

352
00:26:09,747 --> 00:26:12,238
- Well, you've been lucky.
- Yeah. Lucky.

353
00:26:12,417 --> 00:26:15,113
All right. Your EKG
looks perfectly normal.

354
00:26:15,486 --> 00:26:17,977
Your heart rate's good.
The pain you described...

355
00:26:18,156 --> 00:26:20,147
...is not the kind we worry about.

356
00:26:20,324 --> 00:26:22,918
I think what you experienced
was hyperventilation...

357
00:26:23,094 --> 00:26:24,857
...brought on by stress.

358
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:28,464
- Stress?
- And in case you haven't heard...

359
00:26:28,633 --> 00:26:30,931
...stress can give you
a heart attack.

360
00:26:31,102 --> 00:26:34,469
I have no idea what you're up to,
gallivanting out at this hour...

361
00:26:34,639 --> 00:26:37,130
...one week after
having a heart attack...

362
00:26:37,308 --> 00:26:40,800
...but if you were my dad,
I would have you home in bed...

363
00:26:40,978 --> 00:26:42,605
...recuperating.

364
00:26:51,155 --> 00:26:53,817
"If you were my dad..."

365
00:27:46,144 --> 00:27:49,978
Hi, it's Erica. I'm not here,
so leave me a message.

366
00:28:02,593 --> 00:28:04,584
Ouch.

367
00:28:21,045 --> 00:28:23,343
You have one new message.

368
00:28:23,514 --> 00:28:24,776
Message one.

369
00:28:24,949 --> 00:28:28,146
Erica, hi, it's Julian.
I'm in the restaurant...

370
00:28:28,319 --> 00:28:31,948
...and I'm just wondering if you're
on your way. It's about 8:20.

371
00:28:32,123 --> 00:28:35,718
It's a lovely night out here.
It's a nice...

372
00:30:15,159 --> 00:30:16,592
Oh, my...

373
00:30:44,989 --> 00:30:47,423
Go figure.

374
00:32:06,771 --> 00:32:08,033
Zoe!

375
00:32:09,507 --> 00:32:12,203
- Hey, Mom, we're going into town.
- Okay.

376
00:32:12,843 --> 00:32:14,140
Are you crying?

377
00:32:18,115 --> 00:32:19,377
Yeah.

378
00:32:20,084 --> 00:32:21,517
It's my new thing.

379
00:32:21,752 --> 00:32:25,381
- I've gotten abnormally brilliant at it.
- Why? What is it?

380
00:32:30,194 --> 00:32:31,456
I'm in love.

381
00:32:32,596 --> 00:32:33,893
Ain't it great?

382
00:32:35,232 --> 00:32:37,757
Seems like I gotta learn
how to do that...

383
00:32:38,836 --> 00:32:41,031
...Iove-them-and-leave-them stuff,
you know?

384
00:32:41,505 --> 00:32:43,132
Oh, Mom, I hate this.

385
00:32:43,908 --> 00:32:47,309
Now do you get my theory about
all this? You gotta self-protect.

386
00:32:47,478 --> 00:32:49,912
You don't really buy this stuff
you say, do you?

387
00:32:50,181 --> 00:32:55,016
You don't actually think that you
can outsmart getting hurt?

388
00:32:55,753 --> 00:32:59,211
- I think it's worth trying.
- Listen to me.

389
00:33:00,057 --> 00:33:02,992
You can't hide from love
for the rest of your life...

390
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:05,025
...because maybe
it won't work out...

391
00:33:05,663 --> 00:33:07,722
...maybe you'll become unglued?

392
00:33:08,365 --> 00:33:09,992
It's just not a way to live.

393
00:33:10,167 --> 00:33:12,294
Are you telling me this is good?

394
00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:15,703
I think you should consider
the possibility...

395
00:33:17,374 --> 00:33:20,571
...that you and I are more alike
than you realize.

396
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:26,748
I let someone in,
and I had the time of my life.

397
00:33:30,588 --> 00:33:32,351
I've never had the time of my life.

398
00:33:32,823 --> 00:33:34,120
I know, baby.

399
00:33:35,526 --> 00:33:37,187
And I say this...

400
00:33:38,662 --> 00:33:40,721
...from the deepest part
of my heart.

401
00:33:41,131 --> 00:33:43,190
What are you waiting for?

402
00:34:01,852 --> 00:34:03,649
- Hey!
- Great party.

403
00:34:03,821 --> 00:34:06,346
Thank you. My pleasure.

404
00:34:09,994 --> 00:34:12,724
- Hey.
- Hey, good to see you.

405
00:34:13,864 --> 00:34:15,126
You having fun?

406
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:17,597
Not quite.

407
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:17,657
I got you something great
at the farm stand.

408
00:35:24,568 --> 00:35:27,002
These are for you to give me
when you apologize.

409
00:36:01,005 --> 00:36:05,101
Julian, I hope you know how mortified
I am by my behavior.

410
00:36:05,275 --> 00:36:07,402
I was gonna get in touch
or send a note.

411
00:36:07,845 --> 00:36:09,574
- A note?
- A note.

412
00:36:09,847 --> 00:36:11,906
- That's a little chilly.
- Well...

413
00:36:12,182 --> 00:36:13,809
...I'm embarrassed.

414
00:36:13,984 --> 00:36:16,680
I just haven't been myself lately.
What can I say?

415
00:36:17,154 --> 00:36:18,553
Just tell me you're sorry.

416
00:36:19,757 --> 00:36:21,748
I am sorry.

417
00:36:22,926 --> 00:36:24,359
Then you could kiss me.

418
00:36:27,731 --> 00:36:28,993
Kiss you?

419
00:36:33,103 --> 00:36:34,968
You're gonna forgive me
if I kiss you?

420
00:36:35,472 --> 00:36:36,837
I think so.

421
00:36:43,914 --> 00:36:46,747
No one on earth would forgive
you for that kiss.

422
00:36:48,585 --> 00:36:49,847
May I?

423
00:37:11,775 --> 00:37:13,140
I forgive you.

424
00:37:41,405 --> 00:37:42,667
Yes!

425
00:37:48,612 --> 00:37:51,046
- It's the best thing you've ever written.
- It is?

426
00:37:51,215 --> 00:37:53,046
- It's wonderful.
- It is?

427
00:37:53,217 --> 00:37:55,447
Yes, it's sweet,
it's smart, it's funny...

428
00:37:57,254 --> 00:38:00,951
How great is it for you that I'm not
intimidated by your brilliance?

429
00:38:06,864 --> 00:38:09,128
Must we go through this every time?

430
00:38:09,433 --> 00:38:12,027
Come here. Come here.

431
00:38:28,652 --> 00:38:30,279
Good. That's very good.

432
00:38:30,721 --> 00:38:32,484
Anyway, you know
what I'm gonna do?

433
00:38:32,656 --> 00:38:34,214
Oh. Oh, my God!

434
00:38:40,364 --> 00:38:41,626
Oh, I gotta tell you.

435
00:38:41,799 --> 00:38:43,790
I'm totally excited
about this audition.

436
00:38:43,967 --> 00:38:47,562
It's such a great part. Supporting,
but she's a really funny character.

437
00:38:47,738 --> 00:38:51,196
There's this totally hilarious scene
where she's dating this older...

438
00:38:51,375 --> 00:38:52,740
...chauvinistic guy.

439
00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:55,037
Just as they're
about to do it, he moans.

440
00:38:55,212 --> 00:38:58,409
And so she's just thinking that he's,
like, really into her...

441
00:38:58,582 --> 00:39:00,447
...except he's having a
heart attack.

442
00:39:02,052 --> 00:39:03,917
She's, like, totally creeped out...

443
00:39:04,087 --> 00:39:07,750
...and her mom, who basically
despises the guy, rushes in...

444
00:39:07,925 --> 00:39:09,984
...and gives him CPR
and saves his life.

445
00:39:10,828 --> 00:39:12,159
Are you okay?

446
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:14,292
Isn't that funny?

447
00:39:14,464 --> 00:39:14,498
Hold on, hold on.
Let's not get so dramatic here.

448
00:39:14,498 --> 00:39:17,331
Hold on, hold on.
Let's not get so dramatic here.

449
00:39:17,501 --> 00:39:19,230
What are we, four teenagers?

450
00:39:19,403 --> 00:39:21,337
We're all sophisticated people.

451
00:39:21,505 --> 00:39:23,939
Why can't we all stay
for the weekend?

452
00:39:24,174 --> 00:39:27,041
Your mother has work to do,
I've got papers to grade.

453
00:39:27,344 --> 00:39:30,541
You do what you're going to do,
whatever that might be...

454
00:39:30,781 --> 00:39:32,112
I need to talk to you.

455
00:39:32,282 --> 00:39:34,216
- Together, and if we don't,
we don't.

456
00:39:34,384 --> 00:39:35,817
Got a minute?

457
00:39:39,656 --> 00:39:41,556
So your play is about us?

458
00:39:41,725 --> 00:39:43,886
- No, it's about me.
- Am I in it?

459
00:39:44,061 --> 00:39:46,962
Well, a guy like you is in it,
but he's not you.

460
00:39:47,130 --> 00:39:49,860
What happens
to this guy who's not me?

461
00:39:50,033 --> 00:39:52,365
I haven't totally decided.
He can...

462
00:39:52,536 --> 00:39:55,801
He can live, or he can die.

463
00:39:56,573 --> 00:39:58,973
- What are you leaning towards?
- Death.

464
00:40:00,611 --> 00:40:02,272
- It's funnier.
- Fine.

465
00:40:02,679 --> 00:40:05,079
He dies of a funny heart attack.

466
00:40:05,249 --> 00:40:09,413
He's a schmuck, who screwed around
with our heroine, so it won't be sad.

467
00:40:09,586 --> 00:40:11,383
Schmucks are people too, you know?

468
00:40:11,822 --> 00:40:14,188
Death doesn't seem
a little harsh to you?

469
00:40:14,358 --> 00:40:18,988
I went where the story took me. It's a
work of fiction, stuff that I made up.

470
00:40:19,997 --> 00:40:23,228
They're ready to do the hospital
"Do you take Viagra?" scene.

471
00:40:23,734 --> 00:40:28,262
- Should we wait for you?
- Yeah. That's good. That's fine.

472
00:40:29,573 --> 00:40:32,406
So I'm gonna be
the laughing stock of Broadway?

473
00:40:32,576 --> 00:40:35,136
Harry, he's not you.

474
00:40:35,312 --> 00:40:38,611
He's a version of the truth
of you, so to speak.

475
00:40:38,782 --> 00:40:42,013
Dave wants to know
when Henry says, "I love ya"...

476
00:40:42,185 --> 00:40:44,483
...you want that to be "ya,"
not "you," right?

477
00:40:44,655 --> 00:40:46,145
Right.

478
00:41:11,448 --> 00:41:14,110
Well, you look really nice.

479
00:41:14,284 --> 00:41:15,546
Thank you.

480
00:41:15,719 --> 00:41:18,210
- Are you feeling all right?
- You know...

481
00:41:18,388 --> 00:41:21,619
...it isn't like I wanted
to stop seeing you.

482
00:41:21,892 --> 00:41:24,690
We could've carried on
a fun thing for a while.

483
00:41:24,928 --> 00:41:27,829
Why is it that you broads
want all or nothing?

484
00:41:27,998 --> 00:41:29,363
I don't know.

485
00:41:29,533 --> 00:41:31,865
We're just goofy
when it comes to love.

486
00:41:32,736 --> 00:41:35,204
Harry, if it's all right with you...

487
00:41:35,939 --> 00:41:37,497
...I'd like to be friends.

488
00:41:37,874 --> 00:41:41,537
I'm not ready to be your friend.
How's that?

489
00:41:41,778 --> 00:41:43,712
Fine. I understand.

490
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:47,646
Anyway, do you actually
buy that horseshit?

491
00:41:47,818 --> 00:41:50,981
That men and women can be friends
once they've had sex?

492
00:41:51,154 --> 00:41:54,555
I'm friends with my ex-husband,
but we didn't just have sex.

493
00:41:55,125 --> 00:41:57,423
We didn't just have sex either.

494
00:41:57,594 --> 00:42:00,461
Then what was it? I'd love to know.

495
00:42:00,664 --> 00:42:03,531
Can I e-mail it to you
when I figure it out?

496
00:42:04,134 --> 00:42:06,432
Okay. Okay.

497
00:42:06,603 --> 00:42:10,369
Just moving into another phase
with this thing. I'm mad at you.

498
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,938
- I think I'm mad at you too.
- Excellent!

499
00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:17,308
Because I don't like thinking
about you so much...

500
00:42:17,481 --> 00:42:21,815
...and worrying about how you are
and if I ruined your life.

501
00:42:21,985 --> 00:42:25,011
- You've worried about me?
- Yes, honey.

502
00:42:25,188 --> 00:42:26,951
The schmuck...

503
00:42:27,124 --> 00:42:29,422
...who deserves to die...

504
00:42:29,926 --> 00:42:32,258
...worries about you.

505
00:42:32,429 --> 00:42:36,661
Sometimes worrying about you
feels like a full-time job.

506
00:42:36,833 --> 00:42:39,097
Well, doll, I'm doing great.

507
00:42:39,269 --> 00:42:42,170
So you don't have
to work that shift anymore.

508
00:42:42,339 --> 00:42:46,435
Erica? They want you to look at
the costumes for the dancing Henrys.

509
00:42:46,977 --> 00:42:49,207
Are these gonna work for you?

510
00:43:02,259 --> 00:43:05,592
- Mr. Sanborn, back so soon?
- This is it, I'm dying.

511
00:43:05,762 --> 00:43:09,858
I've had 20 minutes of severe chest
pains, nausea, shortness of breath...

512
00:43:10,033 --> 00:43:12,399
...my blood pressure's
gotta be 170l100.

513
00:43:12,569 --> 00:43:15,060
Give me the nitro,
I didn't take Viagra.

514
00:43:15,238 --> 00:43:18,036
Plug me into an EKG.
I'm taking two beta-blockers...

515
00:43:18,208 --> 00:43:20,233
...blood thinners, Lipitor, Procardia.

516
00:43:20,410 --> 00:43:22,310
If I were you,
I'd pound on my chest.

517
00:43:22,479 --> 00:43:26,779
Mr. Sanborn. Your diagnosis, although
fascinating, was entirely incorrect.

518
00:43:27,951 --> 00:43:29,509
- Impossible!
- Do you realize...

519
00:43:29,686 --> 00:43:32,985
...that a severe anxiety attack
can masquerade as a heart attack?

520
00:43:33,957 --> 00:43:36,357
So I'm nuts.

521
00:43:36,526 --> 00:43:40,587
Perfect. The one thing
I'm not taking pills for.

522
00:43:40,764 --> 00:43:42,789
If you don't wanna
be here every week...

523
00:43:42,966 --> 00:43:47,300
...I suggest you do whatever it takes
to decompress. Now lie down.

524
00:43:47,471 --> 00:43:49,939
Just try something with me.
Come on.

525
00:43:52,008 --> 00:43:53,635
Give me your hand.

526
00:43:53,810 --> 00:43:55,641
Relax, relax.

527
00:43:55,812 --> 00:43:57,336
All right, close your eyes.

528
00:43:57,547 --> 00:44:00,675
Okay, good. I want you
to give yourself a visual...

529
00:44:00,851 --> 00:44:02,443
Both eyes.

530
00:44:02,619 --> 00:44:05,053
I want you to give yourself
a visual image...

531
00:44:05,222 --> 00:44:08,988
...of something that gives you
a feeling of peace and serenity.

532
00:44:10,660 --> 00:44:13,151
I don't know. What?

533
00:44:13,330 --> 00:44:16,527
- A hammock.
- Good.

534
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:20,158
- What else?
- Palm trees.

535
00:44:21,271 --> 00:44:23,739
Clear, blue water.

536
00:44:23,907 --> 00:44:26,171
What else do you see? Feel?

537
00:44:26,343 --> 00:44:28,038
Taste?

538
00:44:28,211 --> 00:44:31,305
A peach margarita.

539
00:44:32,582 --> 00:44:35,642
A Cuban cigar.

540
00:44:38,054 --> 00:44:40,318
Miles...

541
00:44:41,525 --> 00:44:44,153
...of soft beach.

542
00:46:06,042 --> 00:46:09,569
I couldn't believe you were calling
from downstairs. You have a beard!

543
00:46:09,846 --> 00:46:13,475
- It's great to see you.
- You couldn't look better.

544
00:46:13,883 --> 00:46:15,783
Thank you. Well, come on in.

545
00:46:15,952 --> 00:46:19,353
No, no. I just wanted
to stop by and say hi...

546
00:46:20,724 --> 00:46:25,525
...and tell you I'm sorry if I ever did
anything that wasn't on the up and up.

547
00:46:26,630 --> 00:46:28,564
What do you mean?
You were great to me.

548
00:46:29,399 --> 00:46:31,799
- I was?
- Always.

549
00:46:31,968 --> 00:46:34,368
That's refreshing. Good.

550
00:46:34,971 --> 00:46:37,769
Well, I don't know what
you've done to yourself...

551
00:46:37,941 --> 00:46:40,102
...but you look absolutely radiant.

552
00:46:40,977 --> 00:46:44,344
I'm three months pregnant. That
might have something to do with it.

553
00:46:44,514 --> 00:46:46,482
- Really?
- Yeah.

554
00:46:46,650 --> 00:46:49,084
- Who's the lucky guy?
- My husband.

555
00:46:49,252 --> 00:46:52,187
Hold on because he really wants
to meet you. Danny.

556
00:46:54,524 --> 00:46:57,357
Harry Sanborn,
this is my husband, Danny Benjamin.

557
00:46:57,527 --> 00:46:59,358
- Heard so much about you.
- I bet.

558
00:46:59,529 --> 00:47:02,089
Well, you know,
with the play and all.

559
00:47:02,265 --> 00:47:04,597
- I'm famous, huh?
- Hey, just to us.

560
00:47:04,768 --> 00:47:08,226
In every interview my mom does,
she always says she made you up.

561
00:47:09,039 --> 00:47:13,533
So the guy in the play
doesn't make it, does he?

562
00:47:16,212 --> 00:47:20,046
He basically dies
at the end of the second act.

563
00:47:20,450 --> 00:47:21,815
But it gets a huge laugh.

564
00:47:23,219 --> 00:47:25,551
I was hoping
she'd give me a reprieve.

565
00:47:25,722 --> 00:47:28,247
Yeah, well...

566
00:47:30,427 --> 00:47:32,361
Okay.

567
00:47:35,632 --> 00:47:38,760
- Good seeing you. Congratulations.
- Thanks.

568
00:47:44,274 --> 00:47:46,868
- How is she?
- She's really good.

569
00:47:47,043 --> 00:47:51,605
Up to her old tricks. Learning Italian,
remodeling her apartment in the city...

570
00:47:51,781 --> 00:47:56,377
Now, if I wanted to see her,
how would that go over?

571
00:47:56,986 --> 00:48:00,786
Only one way to find out.
Except she's out of town right now.

572
00:48:00,957 --> 00:48:03,858
Oh, yeah? Where is she?

573
00:48:04,027 --> 00:48:07,622
Paris. She left two days ago
for her birthday.

574
00:48:08,064 --> 00:48:10,362
But she'll be back next week.

575
00:48:17,173 --> 00:48:19,403
Paris.

576
00:48:59,182 --> 00:49:00,843
Showtime.

577
00:49:40,423 --> 00:49:43,290
- I knew you'd be here.
- You did?

578
00:49:43,460 --> 00:49:47,760
At first I thought I had the wrong
restaurant, but here you are.

579
00:49:48,465 --> 00:49:50,365
- Just like I imagined.
- You mean...

580
00:49:50,533 --> 00:49:52,524
...we're not bumping into each other?

581
00:49:52,702 --> 00:49:54,294
You came here to see me?

582
00:49:55,705 --> 00:49:57,502
I'm aware it was a bold move...

583
00:49:57,674 --> 00:50:02,634
...one of those impulses that grabs
you, but so far we're okay.

584
00:50:02,812 --> 00:50:04,473
Right?

585
00:50:05,315 --> 00:50:09,012
- I mean... I kind of...
- It would be great...

586
00:50:09,185 --> 00:50:11,881
...if you'd let me take that as a yes.

587
00:50:12,055 --> 00:50:14,615
- Would you like a glass of wine?
- Yeah. I would.

588
00:50:14,791 --> 00:50:17,089
I would love one.

589
00:50:20,430 --> 00:50:23,695
I was just gonna give you a kiss hello.

590
00:50:28,771 --> 00:50:30,261
- Okay.
- Whoa.

591
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:32,499
Awkward.

592
00:50:35,011 --> 00:50:38,947
You remember how you said
if we still knew each other...

593
00:50:39,115 --> 00:50:41,549
...we should go to Paris
for our birthdays?

594
00:50:42,185 --> 00:50:45,086
Well, we still know each other.

595
00:50:45,255 --> 00:50:50,921
That's true. But, Harry, I haven't
heard from you in six months.

596
00:50:51,761 --> 00:50:53,285
Yeah.

597
00:50:53,463 --> 00:50:57,126
After I saw you in the theater,
with the dancing Henrys...

598
00:50:58,034 --> 00:51:03,199
- Yes. Sorry...
- No, it's very funny, by the way.

599
00:51:03,406 --> 00:51:06,375
- I had another episode.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

600
00:51:06,543 --> 00:51:09,410
Well, as it turned out, I was fine...

601
00:51:09,579 --> 00:51:14,141
...but I was sure I was dying, and
the doctor in the ER said I needed...

602
00:51:15,184 --> 00:51:17,948
...to decompress. So I did.

603
00:51:18,421 --> 00:51:20,981
I walked out of there
and changed my life.

604
00:51:21,224 --> 00:51:25,217
Sold most of my businesses,
packed my bags...

605
00:51:25,395 --> 00:51:27,727
...moved to an island in the Caribbean.

606
00:51:27,931 --> 00:51:30,764
That is where you've been
all this time? The Caribbean?

607
00:51:31,234 --> 00:51:33,099
Actually, no.

608
00:51:33,469 --> 00:51:35,767
I was there about six hours...

609
00:51:35,939 --> 00:51:39,397
...when it occurred to me
that wasting away on an island...

610
00:51:39,576 --> 00:51:41,840
...couldn't possibly cure
what was ailing me.

611
00:51:42,512 --> 00:51:45,140
So I decided
to take another kind of trip...

612
00:51:45,315 --> 00:51:50,309
...into, let's call it, my past.
- Your past?

613
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:53,216
I thought if I visited some
of the women I've known...

614
00:51:53,389 --> 00:51:57,291
...that maybe I could figure
out how I arrived at being me.

615
00:51:57,927 --> 00:52:01,624
- Wow.
- Wow, yeah, it was quite a journey.

616
00:52:03,399 --> 00:52:05,333
Hi, Louise. Remember me?

617
00:52:06,636 --> 00:52:08,194
Hi, how are...?

618
00:52:08,771 --> 00:52:13,037
Some of the ladies, I admit,
weren't too interested in seeing me...

619
00:52:13,209 --> 00:52:18,909
...or even speaking to me,
but one day, my losing streak ended.

620
00:52:19,082 --> 00:52:20,982
One of them opened up to me.

621
00:52:21,150 --> 00:52:25,177
Hearing what she had to say was no
picnic, but I stuck it out and I listened.

622
00:52:25,355 --> 00:52:28,722
And then I listened harder.
And one of the things I realized...

623
00:52:28,891 --> 00:52:34,056
...was I was actually giving closure
to generations of women.

624
00:52:34,230 --> 00:52:37,461
When you hear the same story
about yourself...

625
00:52:37,634 --> 00:52:42,094
...over and over,
your life begins to add up.

626
00:52:42,538 --> 00:52:48,170
Took me months to find them all.
Visited a dozen different states.

627
00:52:48,344 --> 00:52:51,142
But I traveled the farthest to see you.

628
00:52:59,522 --> 00:53:01,251
I don't believe it.

629
00:53:04,494 --> 00:53:06,086
Me either.

630
00:53:07,063 --> 00:53:10,157
- Doc. How are you?
- I'm good.

631
00:53:10,333 --> 00:53:12,267
- Nice to see you.
- You too.

632
00:53:12,435 --> 00:53:14,494
I should have told
you he was coming...

633
00:53:14,671 --> 00:53:17,196
...but I was so engrossed
in your story. I just...

634
00:53:17,373 --> 00:53:18,931
Sorry I'm late.

635
00:53:19,742 --> 00:53:23,075
- What story?
- Oh, maybe another time.

636
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:28,180
So I guess I should've seen your play.
Would've known how this ended.

637
00:53:28,351 --> 00:53:30,251
- Yeah.
- Yeah, big twist, huh?

638
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:31,682
Yeah.

639
00:53:31,854 --> 00:53:34,084
So, what are you doing
over here, man?

640
00:53:34,323 --> 00:53:39,454
Just a vacation.
I've never been to Paris in January.

641
00:53:39,629 --> 00:53:41,824
It's amazing to run into you.
You look good.

642
00:53:41,998 --> 00:53:44,558
- You look great.
- I haven't been on a gurney...

643
00:53:44,734 --> 00:53:47,362
...in six months, so that's something.

644
00:53:48,971 --> 00:53:51,599
Well, I've just been
to every store in the city.

645
00:53:51,774 --> 00:53:54,538
- What?
- This woman's impossible to buy for...

646
00:53:54,711 --> 00:53:58,738
...but I think I finally found
the right gift.

647
00:54:05,254 --> 00:54:06,551
Happy birthday, baby.

648
00:54:20,336 --> 00:54:23,737
- I'll open it in a bit.
- No, no, no, no. You know what?

649
00:54:23,906 --> 00:54:26,670
- I'm gonna let you two celebrate.
- Harry, no, please.

650
00:54:26,843 --> 00:54:28,868
Stay. Join us for dinner.
We'd love to...

651
00:54:29,045 --> 00:54:32,310
- I can't. I can't. Really.
- Why? You have somewhere to go?

652
00:54:59,442 --> 00:55:01,740
I've spent a lot of time in hospitals.

653
00:55:02,979 --> 00:55:05,243
It doesn't matter, right?

654
00:55:09,452 --> 00:55:12,649
- Went to see a... What was it?
- No, it was a wheaten terrier.

655
00:55:12,822 --> 00:55:14,346
So beautiful. So beautiful.

656
00:55:34,377 --> 00:55:35,674
Make a wish.

657
00:55:40,149 --> 00:55:42,811
To the forces of destiny
that brought us together.

658
00:55:42,985 --> 00:55:46,011
Forces of destiny. Beautiful.

659
00:55:48,724 --> 00:55:51,352
- You don't smoke.
- I'm in Paris.

660
00:55:51,527 --> 00:55:53,392
Secondhand smoke
will kill you anyway.

661
00:55:53,696 --> 00:55:56,688
She's very brilliant,
but the woman cannot hold her liquor.

662
00:55:56,866 --> 00:55:58,891
- I like that about me.
- Me too.

663
00:56:04,006 --> 00:56:06,600
If I were writing this,
this is where I would write:

664
00:56:06,776 --> 00:56:08,334
"An awkward moment."

665
00:56:08,611 --> 00:56:11,273
Honey, if you were writing this,
I'd be dead.

666
00:56:13,349 --> 00:56:15,442
Never fails to amuse her.

667
00:56:17,854 --> 00:56:19,151
- No. Let us.
- Oh, no.

668
00:56:19,322 --> 00:56:22,587
- Please, let us.
- Doc, I insist. I crashed your party.

669
00:56:22,825 --> 00:56:24,383
- No.
- Let me buy you dinner...

670
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:25,993
...on your birthday.

671
00:56:27,063 --> 00:56:28,530
Thank you.

672
00:56:29,932 --> 00:56:32,230
What time does that say?

673
00:56:32,702 --> 00:56:35,432
- Oh, God, I have no idea.
- Oh, wait a minute, l...

674
00:56:35,605 --> 00:56:37,573
Me too. Me too.

675
00:56:48,751 --> 00:56:50,878
You think you look
so handsome in mine?

676
00:56:51,053 --> 00:56:53,817
You know how long I have been
looking for those?

677
00:56:54,390 --> 00:56:56,483
Yes, I do.

678
00:56:59,128 --> 00:57:01,562
Thank you very much.

679
00:57:05,735 --> 00:57:10,729
Excuse me. Thank you.

680
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:15,467
Once again, closure.

681
00:57:24,186 --> 00:57:27,212
- Well, here we are.
- Harry, why don't you take it.

682
00:57:27,390 --> 00:57:30,188
No, no. I think I'm gonna walk.
You two take it.

683
00:57:30,993 --> 00:57:32,255
Well.

684
00:57:32,428 --> 00:57:35,727
- Harry.
- Doc. Thanks for everything.

685
00:57:36,565 --> 00:57:38,965
- Stay well.
- Well, this was fun.

686
00:57:39,135 --> 00:57:44,095
And it was so great to see you.
Honest. So...

687
00:57:47,710 --> 00:57:49,837
It was great to see you.

688
00:57:50,012 --> 00:57:51,707
Look...

689
00:57:51,981 --> 00:57:55,883
...Erica, if you ever...
- No.

690
00:58:03,259 --> 00:58:07,423
- Take care of yourself, Harry.
- Yeah, I will. You too.

691
00:58:08,164 --> 00:58:09,722
It's cold, huh?

692
00:59:10,993 --> 00:59:13,894
Look who gets to be the girl.

693
00:59:18,034 --> 00:59:20,161
Anything else?

694
00:59:37,787 --> 00:59:41,746
- Where's Julian?
- He's back at the hotel.

695
00:59:42,691 --> 00:59:44,955
He said when he saw me with you...

696
00:59:45,494 --> 00:59:47,928
...he knew that I was still
in love with you.

697
00:59:50,032 --> 00:59:52,398
What do you have to say about that?

698
00:59:55,471 --> 00:59:59,771
If it's true, my life just got made.

699
01:00:00,776 --> 01:00:03,074
Why'd you come here, Harry?

700
01:00:06,415 --> 01:00:10,283
Turns out the heart attack
was easy to get over.

701
01:00:10,986 --> 01:00:12,613
You...

702
01:00:13,222 --> 01:00:17,750
...were something else.
I finally get what it's all about.

703
01:00:17,927 --> 01:00:24,127
I'm 63 years old,
and I'm in love...

704
01:00:26,302 --> 01:00:28,634
...for the first time in my life.

705
01:00:31,006 --> 01:00:33,873
That's what I came here to say.

706
01:00:37,513 --> 01:00:38,844
Harry.

707
01:01:12,248 --> 01:01:14,978
- Sanborn.
- Mr. Sanborn.

708
01:01:15,251 --> 01:01:17,845
Four and a half.

709
01:01:18,020 --> 01:01:19,715
Got your table waiting.
