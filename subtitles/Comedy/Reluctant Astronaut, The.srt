1
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:27,700
Liftoff. We have a liftoff.

2
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:55,500
That's one small step for man...

3
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:00,200
...one giant leap for mankind.

4
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,899
Good morning, Sunshine.

5
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:35,299
- Is your sister awake?
- I don't know where she is.

6
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:37,400
You look like you had a wild night.

7
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,200
- Well, good morning, Your Majesty.
- Good morning.

8
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,899
This time, no circles on my pancakes.

9
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,999
Here we go.
You guys are loopy in the morning.

10
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,299
- Good morning, ladies.
- Good morning.

11
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,599
I don't know about
all this free-range stuff.

12
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,000
I had a calf headed for California.

13
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,799
- There's circles on my pancake.
- Eat your breakfast, please.

14
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,899
- I don't like Jupiter.
- I'm sorry, honey.

15
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:05,100
It started out as Venus, and it grew.

16
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,700
- I'm not gonna eat it.
- I'm not gonna eat it.

17
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,899
Girls.

18
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:12,599
You see, the planets are just not aligned.

19
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:16,000
- Is Shepard up yet?
- No, I think he's still sleeping.

20
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,000
- Morning, sleepyhead.
- Dad.

21
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:47,100
You got an e-mail from
that weirdo at FuelFourU.

22
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,300
All right. I think we may have our fuel.

23
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,999
What do you think about this sweater
for my dad?

24
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,299
- I'd divorce you.
- Is it the color?

25
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,700
Why don't you buy him
a new arc welder?

26
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:15,499
You want me to wrap that up,
or should I just give it to you?

27
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,999
What makes you think your dad
would wear a pink turtleneck?

28
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
The color is salmon.

29
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:24,100
That's the color
on the inside of a salmon.

30
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,800
I don't even think a fish
would wear that color on the outside.

31
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,200
Arc welder.

32
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,199
Here we are.

33
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,899
So is my favorite customer coming in?

34
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:42,500
Well, you gonna loan me a cup of coffee?

35
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,800
Depends on how you're gonna
pay me back.

36
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,199
Oh, how's rocket man?

37
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:05,100
- He's fine, Frank. Fine.
- We're taking bets.

38
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,799
Really? What are the odds?

39
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,999
The bet is your husband
will never do it...

40
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,600
...or he's gonna blow himself up.

41
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,400
Nice.

42
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:19,199
Yeah, we're all gonna become rich
on Farmer's failure.

43
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,300
What bet do you wanna cover?

44
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:24,900
Why don't you cover this, Frank?

45
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,799
This space suit will allow me to control...

46
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,600
...the climate and the pressure
that you need to be in space.

47
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:37,299
It's kind of like having your own
personal weather inside here.

48
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,200
Because in space, it's very, very cold.

49
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,500
Is there any questions?

50
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,600
Why don't you just put your hands down,
and we'll just kind of wing it here.

51
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:50,499
- Start here in the front. You.
- Did you buy it at Target?

52
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,999
No, I didn't buy it at Target.

53
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,999
Where did you get it?

54
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Actually, someone was throwing it away,
and I just picked it up.

55
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,800
Have you been to space?

56
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:04,900
No, not yet.

57
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:09,500
Stanley has been telling everyone
about their daddy the astronaut.

58
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:14,200
We need more parents
willing to play dress-up...

59
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:17,899
...to encourage the kids
to activate their imaginations.

60
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,099
Yes, ma'am.

61
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:23,100
So many parents just resort
to dressing up as clowns.

62
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:27,000
You've set a high standard
with this costume.

63
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,899
Well, I appreciate that.

64
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:31,500
You have a good day.

65
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,500
FuelFourU?

66
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,300
Apollo 13?

67
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,900
You never know
with these online screen names.

68
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,800
I really appreciate you coming out here.

69
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,200
Breakdown for you here.

70
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,999
Ten thousand pounds of fuel.
Is this correct?

71
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,399
Yeah.

72
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,299
- You planning on launching a rocket?
- Yeah.

73
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:23,500
- You're shitting me, right?
- No.

74
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:27,400
- Something the matter?
- Well...

75
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,899
...ten pounds, 20 pounds, maybe even
a hundred, that's not a problem.

76
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:38,900
Ten thousand pounds,
ten thousand problems.

77
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:43,399
- When do you need it?
- What's the damage?

78
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,200
Fifty grand.

79
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,300
Cash.

80
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,000
You're delinquent
on six mortgage payments already?

81
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:58,399
I don't know if you understand
how close you are to a foreclosure.

82
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,299
I don't think you understand
how close I am to launching.

83
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,499
Do you know how many times
I've heard that?

84
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,899
Arnie, it's an emergency, okay?

85
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,699
Oh, do I know it's an emergen...

86
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:10,600
We probably have 15 emergencies
written down right here.

87
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:16,100
Twenty. Twenty credit extensions.
Who on earth gets 20?

88
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,999
I assumed more than half that debt
from my dad.

89
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,800
And the bank assumes
that you're gonna pay it back.

90
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,499
Can I give you some advice?

91
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,199
I have no money to pay
for that advice, Arnie.

92
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,599
I don't wanna tell you
how to run your business.

93
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,099
- Well, then don't.
- But I have to...

94
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:36,500
...because I'm your friend first
and a banker second, all right?

95
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,399
Now, folks around here,
they think you're crazy.

96
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,299
I happen to think you're a genius.

97
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:45,800
You got bad credit,
but you got great character...

98
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:50,900
...and that rocket ship of yours
is amazing.

99
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:56,099
But as a friend, I have to
look you in the eye and say that...

100
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,800
...I think it's time you give it a rest.

101
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,600
Bye, Arnold.

102
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:12,400
I need a payment, Farmer!

103
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,000
Okay.

104
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,699
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I have your attention?

105
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:41,300
I'm going to the moon,
and I'm bringing a balloon.

106
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,899
I'm going to the moon,
and I'm bringing an oxygen tank.

107
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:47,799
- I believe you're going to the moon.
- I'm going to the moon...

108
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,699
- ...and I'm bringing Mr. Grump.
- No. But not on the table.

109
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:53,399
- You can't bring your hamster to the moon.
- Yes, I can.

110
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:56,500
Yes, she can.
I believe she's going to the moon.

111
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,100
I'm going to the moon,
and I'm gonna bring sugar.

112
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,899
Hey, sweetie, the objective is
to connect a common theme...

113
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,999
...based on what Daddy's bringing.

114
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,099
So I'm sorry, you can't go to the moon.

115
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,800
I never get to go.

116
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,099
Okay, my turn.

117
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:19,900
I'm going to the moon,
and I'm bringing Sunshine.

118
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:24,800
Well, since she holds air, I believe
we're all going to the moon.

119
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:28,699
- What is that button for, Daddy?
- Oh, that button?

120
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:31,399
You girls better hang on.
It's gonna be a bumpy ride.

121
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,700
We're taking off! We're taking off!

122
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,999
Oh, here we are. We're in space.

123
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,599
Isn't it beautiful out there?

124
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,799
Okay, what's that button for?

125
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,199
- That one?
- Yeah.

126
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,900
That's a very special button too.

127
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,499
That's the one that brings Daddy home.

128
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:50,200
We have to have that one,
because if Daddy didn't have that button...

129
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:54,099
...I'd be up there for a long, long time.

130
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:58,100
Stanley, Sunshine, time for bed.

131
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,599
- Give me a hug, my angels.
- Good night.

132
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,099
Good night. Good night, sweetheart.

133
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,000
See you in a little bit.

134
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,299
- Hey.
- Hey, honey.

135
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,900
- How's it going?
- Pretty good.

136
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:16,300
I just don't know if these gadgets
are gonna work until I launch, you know.

137
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,700
You don't believe I'm gonna launch it,
do you?

138
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,100
I always believe
you're gonna launch the rocket.

139
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:29,000
- Someday.
- Well, someday's coming fast.

140
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,800
- Charlie, it's so late.
- I've been working, baby.

141
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:07,299
Charles, you didn't even take a shower.
You smell like the rocket.

142
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:11,300
- You could've washed your hands.
- I did. I washed my hands.

143
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:14,000
Look at this.

144
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,900
Look at that.

145
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,400
Honey, where's your w...?

146
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,100
Where's your wedding ring?

147
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:24,199
It's in the capsule somewhere.

148
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,900
- Oh, man, in the capsule somewhere.
- Well, honey, I...

149
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:31,600
Well, it came off.
I'll get it. Don't worry about it.

150
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:37,000
No, that's not a star.
That's a shooting star.

151
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,799
How come you guys
only eat the marshmallows?

152
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,600
- You don't like the cereal?
- Tastes like wood.

153
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,999
Here, a whole spoonful of marshmallows.

154
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,799
Yeah, but one piece of a cereal.

155
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,999
One piece of a cereal.
Okay, we gotta get that. Oh, there we go.

156
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,900
You know what you guys started me on?

157
00:12:54,901 --> 00:12:58,400
I don't put milk on my cereal anymore,
and it's your fault.

158
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,799
- I don't put milk on my cereal.
- Oh, hey, honey.

159
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,200
Hey. Look who's here.

160
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,799
Hey. Whoa, easy, easy.
Take it easy.

161
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,799
- I love you, Grandpa.
- Go ahead, sweetie.

162
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,799
- Go say hi.
- What are you feeding them?

163
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:17,100
- Hi, Grandpa.
- Girls. My little tiny people.

164
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,399
Hey, Hal. How you feeling?

165
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,299
I'm actually feeling fine.

166
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:27,100
- Come sit down, Hal. Come on.
- Here, Grandpa will walk you over, okay?

167
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:33,200
Boy, you've made real progress.

168
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,900
Yep.

169
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:38,799
It's gonna take a hell of a lot
more than gunpowder...

170
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,899
...to get this particular aircraft in the air.

171
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,300
Yep.

172
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,800
I never knew it was this big.

173
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:56,699
Well, you got yourself
some mighty pricey metal here, bud.

174
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:59,099
Yeah, well, you gotta
have the good stuff.

175
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:02,500
I'd have more than a carpet burn on my ass
if I didn't protect it.

176
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,300
Farmer?

177
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:08,800
Hey, Karl. How you doing, man?

178
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,399
I'm gonna need your autograph
for this letter.

179
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:18,200
Goddamn, it certainly gets my attention.

180
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:24,800
- Appreciate it. I'll see you later, buddy.
- See you.

181
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,200
What...?

182
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,999
- Farmer!
- You want my house...

183
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,200
- ...I'll give it to you brick by brick.
- It was procedure, Farmer.

184
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,399
I didn't have a choice.

185
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:59,499
The bank wouldn't stand for it
a day longer, and neither would I.

186
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,999
You're way too overextended.

187
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,799
You're just a banker.
A friend wouldn't do what you did.

188
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:07,299
If I didn't care about you, I wouldn't
have sent it in. You got 30 days.

189
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:10,899
Open your eyes. Look at this as
a wake-up call, because the dream is over.

190
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:13,200
It's gotta stop now,
before you lose everything.

191
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,899
Farmer.

192
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:17,999
What's up, Chopper? How's your daddy?

193
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,300
Waiting for you. Want a ride?

194
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,500
No, it's all right. Follow me.

195
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,600
What'd you do, Arnie?

196
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,900
How much does he owe the bank,
Arnold?

197
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,799
- Over 600,000 dollars.
- 600,000 dollars?

198
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,299
He's dangerous. He threw a brick at me.

199
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:42,800
That's enough, Arnold. That's enough.
Will the bank take an apology?

200
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:47,599
- Well?
- I guess...

201
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,600
Farmer, give the bank an apology.

202
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,300
Say you're sorry.

203
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:59,899
- Arnold, I'm sorry.
- Great.

204
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:05,599
Now, Arnold, I'm going to administer
Farmer's spanking in private.

205
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,600
Chopper, could you
see Arnold out for me?

206
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:15,600
Assume the position.

207
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:20,199
You're not really gonna whack me
with that thing, are you?

208
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,799
Come on. I've known you all your life.

209
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,800
But I do see you putting your family
and yourself at serious risk.

210
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,800
One day it's a brick,
the next day it's a bullet.

211
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,499
Men have been known
to do desperate things...

212
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,200
...when they're losing their ranches.

213
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,400
I'm gonna ask you to get...

214
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:41,999
...a psychiatric evaluation.

215
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,400
Before Arnold and me are comfortable
with you in society, you gotta see a shrink.

216
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:51,700
Go over to the school, see Nurse Goode
over there, and talk to her.

217
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,400
Bring it back to me.

218
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,200
What'd they get you for?

219
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,900
Sleeping in class.

220
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:09,000
How about you?

221
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,700
I broke a window.

222
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,999
So, what do you wanna be
when you get out of here?

223
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,399
I don't know.

224
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,200
- What do you mean, you don't know?
- I don't know.

225
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,399
Well, let me tell you something...

226
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,899
...you better know what you wanna do
before somebody knows it for you.

227
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,400
Trust me.

228
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:35,099
Farmer. Nurse Goode can see you now.

229
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,700
Okay.

230
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,400
Well, good luck.

231
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,799
Charlie Farmer.

232
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:50,299
Hey, Beth. I was supposed to
give you this, the judge said.

233
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:53,700
Thank you. Okay.

234
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:59,800
Don't you think that they're a little late
in labeling you crazy?

235
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:01,899
Jumping off a bridge is crazy.

236
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:05,599
- Oh, and building a rocket isn't.
- I threw a brick through a window.

237
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,999
That's why I'm here.

238
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Well, how would you like it if we discussed
your desire to leave the planet?

239
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:13,700
- Not particularly.
- Oh, Charlie.

240
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:19,399
I don't expect you to open up
and start talking in our very first session.

241
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:22,199
Session? There's sessions?

242
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,599
We're all onions, Charlie.

243
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:30,199
We have many, many,
many layers to get through.

244
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,700
See what I'm saying? And, just like...

245
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,199
...well, when you peel an onion,
there may be tears as we come...

246
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,399
Beth, please stop it, okay?

247
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:44,199
Listen, my daddy never told me
that he loved me.

248
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:47,100
And, you know, I'm pretty sure
that your daddy never did either.

249
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:50,899
The resentment that you feel
towards your parents...

250
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:53,900
...is not going to fuel your rocket.

251
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:58,199
- Are you done?
- Well, you're not getting it.

252
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:04,199
The rocket is not going to bring you
a happy childhood.

253
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:09,899
We all just have to grow up
and just take responsibility.

254
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:13,800
Remember during our high school prom,
I asked you go to the moon with me?

255
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:24,800
Well, shoot, Charlie,
that was just about getting laid.

256
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,300
Well, I'm still going.

257
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:33,099
We're not done, Charlie.

258
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:35,000
Is this considered another session?

259
00:19:35,001 --> 00:19:37,299
Have you ever thought
of going into teaching?

260
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:39,499
What the hell would I teach?
What not to do?

261
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:43,500
No. Charlie, you could inspire
some young kid to do what you can't.

262
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,999
But I can, and I will, Beth.

263
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,599
I hate to be the one breaking it to you,
but you are not an astronaut.

264
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,599
It didn't happen, and that's okay.

265
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,999
You know,
the military's not for everyone...

266
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,799
...but we all just still love you,
and you didn't fail...

267
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,200
- ...and don't look at it that way.
- Oh, I don't.

268
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:04,599
- Oh, my God, do you need help.
- Yes, you're right, I do need help.

269
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:07,599
I need to find Shepard
because I gotta launch in 30 days.

270
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,199
You have to find a way
to channel your anger...

271
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:13,699
...or else it will manifest itself
into something...

272
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:15,499
...like, you know, a rocket ship.

273
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,600
Charlie Farmer.

274
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,000
Ms. Graham, I'm here to inspire a kid.

275
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:25,299
I could use an engineer
such as yourself at the house.

276
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:27,300
Why don't you get your things,
and let's go.

277
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:31,600
Excuse me, but we're in the middle
of a history lesson.

278
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:35,299
I apologize, Ms. Graham, but you're
teaching him how to read history...

279
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:39,200
...and I'm gonna show him how to make it.
You have a good day, hon.

280
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,799
- Where are we going?
- Home.

281
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,599
Home? Do we see the...?

282
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,199
Where's the house?
I don't see it anywhere.

283
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,100
Well, it's a long ways to home.

284
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:53,199
Every one of you is now part
of the Farmer space program.

285
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:57,799
If anyone feels that he or she is not fit
to be in the Farmer space program...

286
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,100
...then you should say your piece now.

287
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,400
Does that mean we don't
have to go to school?

288
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,299
Correct.

289
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:06,599
But every morning,
we're gonna hold class...

290
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,699
...and study your regular subjects...

291
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:11,199
...so when you return to school,
you won't be behind.

292
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,300
- Yes, sir.
- Any questions?

293
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:19,400
- Is that all?
- No, honey, not yet.

294
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,199
How big is it?

295
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,799
- It's big.
- Big?

296
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:29,199
- So you've seen it?
- Of course I have.

297
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,500
And you think that he'll let me see it?

298
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:36,099
- Depends.
- Depends? On what?

299
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:39,800
It's not like I'm gonna go
running all over town, "I've seen it."

300
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:50,100
I'm telling. You told.

301
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:03,800
Hey. You and Phyllis been out playing?

302
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,000
What's going on?

303
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:08,399
Why aren't the children in school?

304
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,899
I'll address your issues after the briefing.
We're not quite finished.

305
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:14,700
Charles, you need to answer my question.
What's going on?

306
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,099
Oh, hey, Hal. You wanna
be part of the program?

307
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:20,300
- Sir?
- The space program.

308
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:26,100
- Charles. Bye, Phyllis.
- You guys are released, okay?

309
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,499
I want you here tomorrow morning
at 0500 sharp, okay?

310
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,900
Now, go back to the house. All right.

311
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,499
They're going back to school tomorrow.

312
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:37,799
It's five weeks maximum,
and they're back at school, I promise you.

313
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:41,299
You know that they're never gonna
get the kind of education at school...

314
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:42,500
...that they can get here.

315
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:45,699
They don't even teach science
in these schools anymore.

316
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:49,199
You know what Shepard's science teacher
said to him? I mean, get this.

317
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,500
She said, "Science isn't sexy."

318
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:56,200
I mean, do you want your girls to grow up
only knowing when Mercury's in retrograde?

319
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,899
- You know?
- What the hell happened to you?

320
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:03,800
It's five weeks maximum, and then
they're back in school, I promise. Okay?

321
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:19,900
Unit 4-0 to Central.

322
00:23:19,901 --> 00:23:22,899
Do we know how many entrances
there are to this property?

323
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:26,199
I believe there are four entrances
to the property. Four entrances.

324
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,800
I don't know if they're gated or not.

325
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:34,099
Suspect has been trying
to secure rocket fuel, over.

326
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:38,100
Roger, we copy.
Miller is about 100 yards out.

327
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:41,299
You should be able to see him.
He's coming down the hill, over.

328
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:45,300
Be aware there are seven suspects. We have
on visual suspect, one Jesus Garcia.

329
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,500
We copy that.

330
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:56,100
Killbourne, Mathis,
currently securing the barn.

331
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,500
Can I help you?

332
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:19,299
- Charles Farmer?
- Yeah.

333
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:21,999
We're with the Federal Bureau
of investigation.

334
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,999
Sir, we have been made aware,
through electronic documents...

335
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,000
...that you have been searching
for a high-grade fuel commonly used...

336
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:32,299
...to launch rockets.

337
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:36,099
Are you aware that you have an illegal
alien working on your premises?

338
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:39,300
Pepe Garcia. Jesus Garcia.

339
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,799
If you cooperate, we could see to it...

340
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:44,899
...that Mr. Garcia
could stay here with your family.

341
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:47,399
We're going to the moon.

342
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:50,599
- That's really rotten.
- It's rather generous of us.

343
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,500
And where is that man going?

344
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:57,299
It's very simple, Mr. Farmer...

345
00:24:57,300 --> 00:25:00,999
...it's illegal to try to obtain
such a high-grade fuel for private use.

346
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,699
Anyone trying to acquire this kind of fuel
has to be considered a threat.

347
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:05,800
This is the real deal.

348
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:08,699
- Well, I'm no threat.
- Well, how do we know...

349
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:11,800
- ...you're not building a warhead?
- Because I'm not at war.

350
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,099
We just wanna let you know
your little rocket ain't gonna fly...

351
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:18,499
...as long as we're doing
this investigation.

352
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,000
Yeah.

353
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,699
I filled out the FAA application,
sent it in over six months ago.

354
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:41,699
Sent all my flight plans,
illustrations of the vessel...

355
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:44,599
...never heard anything back
saying I couldn't launch.

356
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,999
They didn't think you were serious.

357
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,000
- Well, how can they stop me now?
- Jeez, Farmer.

358
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,599
With this Patriot Act, the way
they've twisted the laws up so much...

359
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,599
...they can do whatever
they please...

360
00:25:56,600 --> 00:26:00,199
...as long as they feel you're a threat
to homeland security.

361
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,199
What do you want me to do?

362
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:05,400
Well, twist it some more.
Isn't that what lawyers are good at?

363
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:09,699
All right. Did they say they were
gonna press any charges?

364
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:12,400
Well, no, not exactly.
They said I'm under investigation.

365
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:16,000
That means they're gonna
be watching your every move.

366
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,200
Yeah.

367
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:23,299
I got a buddy in Manhattan.

368
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:28,100
He's a partner in one of these big firms
that specializes in cases like this.

369
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,400
- Give it a try.
- Maybe he can...

370
00:26:31,401 --> 00:26:33,799
...shed some light on the situation.

371
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,200
He owes me a favor.
It won't cost you a nickel.

372
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:38,000
Set it up. Grab the boom.

373
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:42,899
Going into space
doesn't take NASA anymore.

374
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:46,900
Friends, we are here at the entrance
of the space cowboy's ranch.

375
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,799
We are told that behind me,
in this barn, is a rocket...

376
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:55,799
...a rocket that Charles Farmer
wants to launch into outer space.

377
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:58,299
After graduating
from Meriwether Lewis High School...

378
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:01,199
...he continued his education
at the University of Texas...

379
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,599
...where he received a degree
in aerospace engineering.

380
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:07,799
Soon after, Charles Farmer
enlisted in the Air Force...

381
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:12,200
...where he developed his skills as a pilot,
flying such planes as the F-4 Phantom.

382
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:16,700
The rocketeer Charles Farmer
was in fact training to be an astronaut...

383
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:19,299
...before he was discharged
from the military.

384
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:20,799
- Hello.
- Hey, what's up?

385
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:23,699
Holy cow, Munchak.
You didn't tell me your friend was CNN.

386
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:26,499
This is what he said.
He said embrace the media, Farmer.

387
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,500
Invite them in.
They're for your protection.

388
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:30,600
You want them on your side, Farmer.

389
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:32,700
All right.

390
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:36,599
He built the rocket.
I'm sure he built a retractable roof.

391
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,899
- Really?
- I don't think he'd build a rocket...

392
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,300
...and forget about the roof.

393
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:45,900
- Unless he never plans on launching it.
- Then why are we here?

394
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:49,200
Because if we aren't here,
and he launches...

395
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:52,000
...we're gonna look like asses.

396
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:55,300
And if he does, and we are here?

397
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:59,000
We still look like asses.

398
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,800
- There he is!
- Mr. Farmer!

399
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,400
Mr. Farmer, quick question.

400
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:15,199
Listen, if you guys settle down
and ask your questions one at a time...

401
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,699
...I'll answer them
to the best of my ability.

402
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:21,599
Is it important to you that people know
the importance of space travel?

403
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:25,099
I'll put it to you this way.
There are a lot of people in this world...

404
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:27,899
...that think Michael Jackson
had the first moonwalk.

405
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:30,499
Mr. Farmer, when do you plan
on launching your rocket?

406
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,900
- Soon.
- Mr. Farmer, why are you doing this?

407
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,900
It's always been my dream.

408
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:50,200
The rocket is huge. It's really big.

409
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,800
He's more of an astro-nut.

410
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,400
- Who was it?
- My wife.

411
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,499
She wants an autograph.

412
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:06,500
You hear about this? There's a guy in Texas
building his own rocket in his back yard.

413
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:10,200
This guy is planning
on launching himself into orbit.

414
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:14,099
Here's my question.
Wouldn't it be easier just to say:

415
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:16,800
"Honey, I want a divorce"?
Okay, wouldn't that be...?

416
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,500
That's not very funny.

417
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:23,399
Looks like a really beautiful day today.

418
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,900
Afternoon high of 65,
down to 35 tonight.

419
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,699
- Morning, Hal.
- And if you're launching a rocket...

420
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:31,599
...the weather looks really good
over most of the country.

421
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:34,199
This is what's known
as the rocket graveyard.

422
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:37,199
Farmer gathered most of what he needed
from places like this.

423
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,300
If you're looking to build a rocket,
this is the place to start.

424
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:47,899
Farmer's rocket is housed
in the barn that you're seeing below.

425
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:51,499
Due to the overwhelming interest,
he has opened his barn to the public...

426
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:53,900
...allowing them
to view the rocket themselves...

427
00:29:53,901 --> 00:29:56,300
...only hoping to alleviate
some of this congestion.

428
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:00,199
Can he do it? Well, sure he can.

429
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,500
Now, will he do it? That's to be seen.

430
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:05,000
There are lots of FAA regulations...

431
00:30:05,001 --> 00:30:08,599
...that keep people from turning
the sky into a playground.

432
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,899
But the astronaut's plans
for space travel...

433
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:14,699
...first have to be approved by the FAA.
A hearing has been scheduled.

434
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:17,799
How long will the government
not allow you to launch your rocket?

435
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,799
- They're not stopping me.
- Is it true...

436
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:23,000
...Elton John plans to re-release
"Rocket Man" to help raise money?

437
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,899
This is exactly
what we didn't want to happen.

438
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:28,399
Let's get what we can on this guy.
Find something.

439
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:31,299
We gotta get this space cowboy's
head out of the clouds.

440
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:33,500
Pack up, boys. We're going to Texas.

441
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,600
Well, the man deserves a second chance.

442
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:40,300
All right, more presents.

443
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:44,000
That's the last of it.

444
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,500
Hey, Stanley.

445
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:50,799
Why don't you change your hamster cage?
Use paper...

446
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:54,399
Now, wait a minute. I'd like to see that.
Come on, let me have a look.

447
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,999
Don't believe everything you read,
honey. It just...

448
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,499
- I wanna read it.
- I wish she had your paper, Pepe.

449
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:01,100
She can't read Spanish.

450
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,200
Your dad's right.

451
00:31:06,201 --> 00:31:07,900
- Change your hamster cage.
- Okay.

452
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:13,599
They called us a cult. They said we were
like a branch of the Moonies or something.

453
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,999
They think our family's
a bunch of space cadets.

454
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,399
I know. I know.

455
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:20,199
- How can they do that?
- Because they can.

456
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:25,099
We are a normal family. We need
to go tell everyone that it isn't true.

457
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:28,100
Well, honey, we just need
to show them, okay?

458
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:46,699
We got a winner here. It's a winner!

459
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:48,899
Hey, here you go, bud.

460
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:50,200
That's what I get?

461
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,199
Don't you worry about them.

462
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,300
Just forget about them, Charles.

463
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:10,500
- Thank you.
- For what, baby?

464
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,100
For this.

465
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:34,300
Excuse me. I wanna talk to you
about the ride.

466
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:36,499
Two tickets.

467
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:41,599
No, sir. I mean, if I wanted to buy this ride
from you, how much would it cost me?

468
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,200
Well, you can rent it for 500 a week.

469
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:47,299
- Can we talk some business?
- Sure.

470
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:50,499
- Yeah?
- Absolutely. You gonna be around?

471
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:51,700
Yeah, I'll be here.

472
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,100
Colonel Masterson.

473
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:32,100
Up there in space, you get
a totally different perspective.

474
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,299
Different every time.

475
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:39,300
Different perspective of the Earth.
Different perspective of yourself.

476
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:41,500
Every time's completely different.

477
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:43,800
It's just...

478
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:47,000
It's just beautiful, is what it is.

479
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:49,500
Beautiful.

480
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:53,800
You see the world, and you realize
how small we all are.

481
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:56,600
Life-changing.

482
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,400
Definitely life-changing.

483
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,099
This is good chicken, Audrey.

484
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,600
- Thank you.
- You're about to make me start crying.

485
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:12,100
My last mission was on the Endeavor.

486
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,800
I don't know who they are.

487
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:18,700
It's the name of the space shuttle
Colonel Masterson flew on.

488
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,999
We don't have a name for our rocket.

489
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,100
You don't?

490
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,599
You don't have a name
for your rocket, Farmer?

491
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:29,099
Well, we just hadn't got to that part yet.

492
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:31,799
We're gonna have to think of some
names, aren't we?

493
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:32,900
Sunshine?

494
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,700
- Licorice.
- Licorice?

495
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,700
Okay, who's for Licorice?

496
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:45,699
Okay.

497
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:50,300
Now, Stanley submitted the name
of the Rockin' Rocket.

498
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:52,900
- Who wants Rockin' Rocket?
- I like that.

499
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:57,499
Uncle Eddie has voted
for everything we've said so far.

500
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:00,300
- I'm taking this as seriously as you are.
- Okay.

501
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:03,300
Now, Shepard has decided,
as you told me before...

502
00:36:03,301 --> 00:36:06,299
- ...you wanna change your name?
- Yeah, I'm changing my name.

503
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:08,799
I'll think about it more.
I'm not sure what I want.

504
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,700
Okay. Pepe.

505
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:28,399
What does that mean?

506
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,399
It ain't gonna be the name of the rocket,
so don't worry.

507
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:34,999
What does it mean, though?
Because if we're all going to vote on it...

508
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,300
It means "the other woman," honey.

509
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,300
No. You are not voting for that name.

510
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
I think we should go out
and see the other woman.

511
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,500
Son of a bitch, Farmer.

512
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,200
- You built this thing?
- Bolt by bolt.

513
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:26,100
That is some serious engineering.

514
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:29,299
You don't think they'd have
brought you down here...

515
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:31,499
...if it was a bottle rocket, do you?

516
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,600
Good grief.

517
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:39,100
- You're serious about this.
- Absolutely.

518
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:50,300
Lookie here, you.

519
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:56,700
What happens...

520
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:01,300
...if the rocket doesn't launch?

521
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:06,400
I know it's not the company line here.
I know.

522
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:10,000
But I'm a dad, baby.

523
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:17,400
Well, that's why he needs our support
regardless of the outcome.

524
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:22,400
It's not mandatory.

525
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:27,300
No, it's love.

526
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,600
What do you think?

527
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:58,999
I think that it is gonna be one sad-ass day
up here in Farmerville...

528
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,999
...when they haul all your hard work
off to the junkyard.

529
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,900
I think that. What do you think?

530
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:12,699
You think they're gonna let you
go up into outer space?

531
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:14,200
A civilian?

532
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:16,999
They don't let civilians
go up into outer space.

533
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,299
Astronauts go into outer space.

534
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:21,599
Professional astronauts
who have been trained...

535
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:24,399
...to withstand the pressures
and the strain...

536
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:28,400
...and the emotional stress
of leaving your family behind.

537
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:32,200
Ed, you know my dad died.
That's why I left.

538
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:35,999
- Of course I know your dad...
- My family needed me.

539
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,900
But if that was a test, you failed.

540
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,800
What do you think NASA was thinking?

541
00:39:43,801 --> 00:39:47,699
This boy's gonna go into outer space.
His dad dies, and he wants to go home.

542
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:52,000
I thought there's one person on this earth
that might understand, and that's you.

543
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:56,100
I really... I really didn't expect this.

544
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:04,800
What if I told you I could get you
a seat on the shuttle?

545
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:08,499
I'd say I don't wanna
hitch a ride on the bus.

546
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:11,200
Forget that. Forget about
hitching a ride on the bus, okay?

547
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:15,399
Forget the rocket. You forget the rocket
that you put a lot of hard work into.

548
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:19,399
You get these people off your back,
get these idiots with cameras out of here...

549
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:22,899
...then you go up into outer space
the right way.

550
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:24,800
The safe way.

551
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:29,299
- You don't think I can do it, do you?
- Forget that.

552
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:32,299
This is about money.
Not even millions of dollars anymore...

553
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:36,300
...billions of dollars. 16.2 billion dollars
in this year's budget alone.

554
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,399
- For what?
- Who cares for what.

555
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,099
For whatever they want.

556
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:43,499
They're not gonna let you go up
in your John Deere riding lawnmower...

557
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:46,099
...into outer space
and try and come back down...

558
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:49,700
...and make them look stupid.
Do you think that's really gonna happen?

559
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:54,600
Don't answer me now.
I don't want your answer right now.

560
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:57,200
But I want you to think about it.

561
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:05,300
Nice rocket, though.

562
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:11,599
Will Charles Farmer be allowed
to launch his rocket?

563
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,099
That's why we're here today.

564
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:17,599
The FAA, FBI, CIA, the Department
of Energy, and members of the military.

565
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:20,199
- They're all here.
- What do you think about all this?

566
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:22,600
Looks like we got home-field advantage,
don't it?

567
00:41:22,601 --> 00:41:26,400
They're not allowing cameras
or the media inside during the hearing.

568
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:59,599
We are assembled here
to review an application...

569
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:02,299
...for the launching of a spacecraft.

570
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:06,199
We'll be asking a series of questions.
Answer to the best of your knowledge.

571
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:07,599
Yes, sir.

572
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:10,399
Let's begin with your flight plan
that you've submitted.

573
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:13,799
Your plan is to do one complete orbit
of the Earth.

574
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:18,500
Once completed, the capsule
will re-enter the atmosphere.

575
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,500
Sounds easy. Simple.

576
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:26,000
- Yes, sir.
- Well, it's not.

577
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:31,199
I would submit that's the gentleman's
opinion, not a statement of fact.

578
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,299
You are aware this is not a court of law.

579
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:35,700
I am, but I'm not gonna sit here
like a potted plant.

580
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,600
I hope not.

581
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:41,399
As head of the FAA, my opinion
might have some credence...

582
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:43,699
- ...on the subject of space flight.
- Yes, sir.

583
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:46,900
You based your design
on the Atlas rocket, yes?

584
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,999
- Yes, sir.
- Were you aware that the Atlas...

585
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,999
...comes from the design
of a ballistic missile?

586
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,899
- Yes, sir.
- So basically...

587
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:58,399
- ...you've built a missile in your barn.
- That's incorrect.

588
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,600
Will Beacon, Central intelligence Agency.

589
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:05,300
How do we know
that you're not constructing a WMD?

590
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:11,699
Well, because if I was building
a weapon of mass destruction...

591
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:13,300
...you wouldn't be able to find it.

592
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:19,900
- Very funny, Mr. Farmer.
- That's just the truth.

593
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:25,200
Here we are. Thanks for waiting.

594
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:29,899
Hi, thanks for waiting.
Can I take your order?

595
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:33,799
- Audie Farmer? The astronaut's wife?
- Yes, ma'am. What can I get for you?

596
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:37,399
Gretchen Boyd
from Child Protective Services.

597
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:39,500
Would you please sit down?

598
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:43,300
- No, thank you.
- Mrs. Farmer...

599
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:45,799
...it has come to our attention...

600
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:50,500
...that your children, as well as yourself,
may be in harm's way.

601
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:54,699
How so?

602
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:59,399
Your husband has literally brainwashed
you and your children.

603
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:01,399
He's taken them out of school...

604
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:06,600
...and he has isolated his entire family
from any other outside influence.

605
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:15,900
It's time you took control of your family
before someone else does it for you.

606
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:23,500
- Who's your personnel at Mission Control?
- Shepard Farmer, my son.

607
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:26,899
- Does he have any experience?
- Sure does. Fifteen years.

608
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:28,899
Is this a joke to you, Mr. Farmer?

609
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:32,199
A 15-year-old will be the head
of your mission control?

610
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:34,999
He's perfectly capable
of launching his dad into space.

611
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:39,000
- Don't underestimate what my child can do.
- Come on. He's 15 years old.

612
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:43,800
We also have an evaluation that was
done recently by a Dr. Beth Goode.

613
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:45,500
Nurse Goode?

614
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:48,999
These are alarming comments
made by the doctor.

615
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,600
She said that Mr. Farmer is angry...

616
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,199
...unstable...

617
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:55,699
...delusional...

618
00:44:55,700 --> 00:44:59,399
...and that his overall mental health
is in question.

619
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:03,800
Charlie, your father took his own life,
is that correct?

620
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:09,800
Don't go there, colonel.

621
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:24,499
I can tell you right now,
what you have built here...

622
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:27,399
...is a one-way ticket to the afterlife.

623
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:30,599
A facility in which Mr. Farmer
could get himself into space.

624
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:33,199
The U.S. government
has a space program, Mr. Farmer.

625
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,899
Why don't you just leave this
to the professionals?

626
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:39,500
In 1960 they started a space race.

627
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:43,000
By 1969 we were on the moon.

628
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:46,600
Now, in that short period of time,
look what we accomplished.

629
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:50,599
And in my opinion,
I believe that if some other country...

630
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:52,799
...wanted to go to the moon
and live there...

631
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:57,100
...we'd get in a war with them
because we think the moon is ours.

632
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Well, it's not.

633
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:06,200
Just like it's not your right to tell me
whether or not I can launch into space.

634
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:08,100
Mr. Farmer, we have laws.

635
00:46:08,101 --> 00:46:10,599
I know we have laws.
We got all kind of laws.

636
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:13,899
We got more laws to tell us
what we can't do than anything else.

637
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:16,999
We got laws to protect us
from other laws.

638
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,599
- Comments like that do not help.
- Listen, you've been talking all morning.

639
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:22,300
Let me talk for a minute.

640
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:24,900
Okay?

641
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:27,300
I won't take long.

642
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:33,900
When I was a kid, they used to tell me
that I could be anything I wanted to be.

643
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:38,700
No matter what.

644
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:45,100
And maybe I am insane, I don't know,
but I still believe that.

645
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:48,000
I believe it with all my heart.

646
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:54,300
Somewhere along the line...

647
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:58,100
...we stopped believing
that we could do anything.

648
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:05,000
And if we don't have our dreams,
we have nothing.

649
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:11,300
You'll be informed of our decision.

650
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:25,000
I'm gonna save your life.

651
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:29,800
I'm gonna tell you something
that no one else in there will tell you.

652
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:33,699
The U.S. military has enough firepower
pointed at your ranch...

653
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:36,199
...that if you decide to launch...

654
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:40,900
...within seconds, your remains
will be spread over five states.

655
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:47,400
- Is that a threat?
- No.

656
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:50,400
You're the threat.

657
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:03,699
Don't believe a word he says, Farmer.

658
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:06,299
Nobody's gonna fire any missiles at you.

659
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:09,799
They have no law to stop you,
so they're just trying to intimidate you.

660
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:11,200
I don't know.

661
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:17,100
Actually, I think they're pretty good
at assassinating people who have dreams.

662
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,300
Where's your helmet?

663
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:40,499
Now, I think that's it, Mrs. Farmer.

664
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:41,800
Thank you.

665
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:50,000
- So is it true?
- What?

666
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:53,099
Got a million dollars for your story?

667
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:54,899
No, Vanessa, it's not true.

668
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:57,099
I won't tell anyone. I read about it in...

669
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:59,000
Vanessa, it's not true.

670
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:02,999
Your total is 86.05.

671
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,200
Sorry. Here.

672
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:16,600
Watch your fingers.

673
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:21,300
I'm sorry, Mrs. Farmer,
but your card was declined.

674
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:25,000
Would you like to try another one?

675
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:28,599
Can you just keep all this here...

676
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:30,899
...and we'll come back
in a little while, okay?

677
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:32,800
Come on, girls. Come on.

678
00:50:01,700 --> 00:50:03,300
I'm going to the moon...

679
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,300
...and I'm bringing this brick.

680
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,099
Kids, your mom and I
need a private moment.

681
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:20,399
No. This has been private long enough.

682
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:24,100
Now, you can lie to me as much as you
want, Charles, but don't lie to them.

683
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:27,100
Tell them.

684
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:30,499
Tell them we might not have a house
in a few weeks.

685
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:33,599
- Knock it off, Audie, okay, please?
- No, you knock it off.

686
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:35,900
- Please, knock it off.
- And what was your plan?

687
00:50:35,901 --> 00:50:37,300
Blasting off this Earth...

688
00:50:37,301 --> 00:50:40,799
...and leaving us here to deal with
the consequences? With no money...

689
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:43,700
- ...nothing, no money for food?
- Oh, really? Is that right?

690
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:48,500
I'm sorry.

691
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,999
So we don't have any food?
Is that what you think?

692
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,299
Kids, you don't have anything
to worry about...

693
00:50:56,300 --> 00:50:58,699
...because we got plenty of food, okay?

694
00:50:58,700 --> 00:50:59,700
Here's food.

695
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:03,499
You want macaroni and cheese?
You want salmon in white sauce?

696
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:05,399
- You want rice pilaf?
- Stop it!

697
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:09,400
- We got all kinds of food!
- Shepard, take the children out of here.

698
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:16,899
What, do you wanna throw that?
You gonna throw something at me, Audie?

699
00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:21,799
- Is that what you wanna do? Go ahead!
- You wanna see flying saucers?

700
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:25,599
Don't you ever accuse me of that again
in front of the kids. You understand me?

701
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:28,300
You're not taking care of us
when we don't have a home!

702
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:30,999
You have to keep us safe!

703
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:34,900
And this dream that we all share
feeds one person, and that's you!

704
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:41,500
You're gonna lose everything, Charles,
including your family.

705
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:57,500
Now, I need to clean up this kitchen.

706
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:04,300
I'm sorry I did this.

707
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:16,300
Audie.

708
00:52:21,100 --> 00:52:24,700
I love you and those kids
more than anything in this world.

709
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:28,700
But if I don't do what I believe in...

710
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:35,500
...then I haven't done them
any good at all.

711
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:43,200
I have always believed.

712
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:47,800
I just don't know anymore.

713
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:18,600
Okay. Here we go.

714
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:23,300
- Hold Mommy's purse.
- Audie?

715
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:29,000
Audie, honey, you don't have to leave.

716
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:32,700
It's Sunday. We're going to church.

717
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:37,599
I'm hoping they'll learn something about
forgiveness, because they'll need it.

718
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:41,600
- Come on, Audie, don't do that.
- No, Charles. They worship you.

719
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:44,800
And so that I don't get bitter...

720
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:48,200
...and call you an ass for lying to us...

721
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:52,700
...I'm gonna have to figure out
a way to forgive you.

722
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:56,000
And so will they.

723
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,100
You know, I tell you one thing.

724
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:16,400
You are one fabulous father.

725
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:19,100
And you know why, Farmer?

726
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:24,500
This man couldn't even get his family
to eat dinner together.

727
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:29,900
But you have got your family...

728
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:32,700
...dreaming together.

729
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:36,000
That is big stuff, sir.

730
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:39,300
Really big stuff.

731
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:50,000
Boy, they gotta burn a lot of fuel
to run them cars, you know it?

732
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:56,299
Gotta wonder if all them cars would
be going around in circles like that...

733
00:54:56,300 --> 00:54:58,700
...if they didn't have all that advertising.

734
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:06,699
The fact of the matter is, Doug,
if you advertise on my rocket...

735
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:08,299
...it's gonna raise your sales.

736
00:55:08,300 --> 00:55:11,399
It just stands to reason.
Plus, you'll be getting attention...

737
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:14,699
...that you normally wouldn't get
from conventional methods.

738
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:17,899
Now, I've got a letter out
to the CEO of Coca-Cola.

739
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:19,800
I expect to hear back from them soon.

740
00:55:19,801 --> 00:55:22,799
If they come on board,
they'll be right here.

741
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:27,800
But before they come on and paint
the whole thing red, you got your choice.

742
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:29,800
I mean, look at this.

743
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:32,800
Can you imagine?

744
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:37,399
Dunkin' Donuts blasting off into space.

745
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:39,299
What if your mission's aborted...

746
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:42,300
...or your success doesn't measure
to this final statement?

747
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:46,399
- What are you implying?
- The risk factor is high, Farmer.

748
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:47,700
But it's an educated risk.

749
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:50,999
Did you read the case study on Tang?

750
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:54,200
The profits they made off putting
that orange dust up on board.

751
00:55:54,700 --> 00:55:57,299
I've made a graph. Did you look at it?

752
00:55:57,300 --> 00:55:59,799
Oh, yeah, Tang.
I raised three kids on that stuff.

753
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:01,399
Well, it's full of vitamins.

754
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:03,999
What's that little old cheesy deal
y'all got now?

755
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:07,099
I mean, tell me what happens
if your whole mission goes to shit.

756
00:56:07,100 --> 00:56:10,899
- I mean, I can't deal with much more of it.
- You mean, like, if I die?

757
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:13,999
If something were
to happen to you, Farmer...

758
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,599
...candy sprinkles, M&M's,
Oreo cookies...

759
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:19,900
...there's no amount of topping...

760
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:23,999
...that would cover the amount
of guilt that I would have.

761
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,899
Look, if you die...

762
00:56:25,900 --> 00:56:30,599
...the book deal, Good Morning America,
that TV movie, Jay Leno...

763
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:32,699
...all that vanishes.

764
00:56:32,700 --> 00:56:36,499
Without a successful mission, I don't
see the profits breaking into the red.

765
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:38,900
I might as well go put my money
in Kleenex stock...

766
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:42,800
...because all you're gonna be producing
is a ton of tears.

767
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:45,899
But if you circle the world...

768
00:56:45,900 --> 00:56:49,500
...you land back over in your back yard
like your mission plan says...

769
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:53,200
...you're a man-made American hero.

770
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:56,999
Now if I could only launch a rocket
with jelly doughnuts.

771
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,699
Sunshine, why don't you go
give your grandpa one, okay?

772
00:56:59,700 --> 00:57:02,899
He loves the sprinkles.
Take Grandpa a doughnut. There you go.

773
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:05,100
- Take Grandpa a doughnut.
- Just have two, okay?

774
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:07,000
Just two.

775
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:10,799
- Do you want one?
- No, honey, I've already had three or four.

776
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:13,100
With, like, seven cups of coffee and...

777
00:57:14,700 --> 00:57:17,200
Grandpa, here's a doughnut.

778
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:20,200
Grandpa, here's a doughnut.

779
00:57:27,100 --> 00:57:29,100
- Grandpa no wake up.
- What, sweetie?

780
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:33,000
Grandpa no wake up.

781
00:57:47,900 --> 00:57:49,400
Dad?

782
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:57,300
Oh, Dad.

783
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:55,400
There are no stop signs up there.

784
00:58:58,200 --> 00:59:00,200
There is no defining space.

785
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:06,200
We have always defined our space.

786
00:59:08,300 --> 00:59:11,200
A wall here, a room there.

787
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,800
A hallway, a road.

788
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:22,200
We have this way of dividing our space
until it equals a direction.

789
00:59:25,300 --> 00:59:28,200
We even created a space for the dead.

790
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:34,600
Space is a difficult thing to grasp.

791
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,800
Man, Farmer...

792
00:59:40,100 --> 00:59:42,600
...you have the most abstract thoughts.

793
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:45,900
They don't make any sense at all.

794
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:50,800
I'm just waiting for the other thoughts
to string all this mess together.

795
00:59:52,700 --> 00:59:54,200
Hey, who's that out there?

796
00:59:57,700 --> 01:00:00,500
Maybe one of Hal's long-lost friends.

797
01:00:10,300 --> 01:00:11,800
How you doing?

798
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:14,800
How many head of cattle
do you run out here?

799
01:00:15,700 --> 01:00:17,700
Enough to suit me.

800
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:20,500
You are the property owner?

801
01:00:22,700 --> 01:00:24,100
Yeah.

802
01:00:24,700 --> 01:00:27,199
- Charles Farmer.
- Correct.

803
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:29,899
I'm appraising your land
for First National Bank...

804
01:00:29,900 --> 01:00:32,399
...who's actively seeking a foreclosure.

805
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:33,900
What was your name?

806
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:36,300
Sir?

807
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:39,499
- What was your name again?
- Robert Wilson.

808
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:41,499
Robert, nice to meet you.

809
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:44,899
You know, I own 352 acres.

810
01:00:44,900 --> 01:00:47,200
Did you ever try to find a body
on that much land?

811
01:00:50,300 --> 01:00:52,500
I'm not the bad guy here, mister.

812
01:00:53,700 --> 01:00:56,000
Well, you're not the good guy either.

813
01:01:08,700 --> 01:01:12,299
Shep, look here. I think I've figured out
another way to make our fuel.

814
01:01:12,300 --> 01:01:15,099
We combine kerosene with hydrazine.

815
01:01:15,100 --> 01:01:16,300
Are you sure, Dad?

816
01:01:16,301 --> 01:01:20,099
Son, I don't know another way to do it
unless we completely modify the engine.

817
01:01:20,100 --> 01:01:22,600
Plus, we got all the stuff
right here in the barn.

818
01:01:23,300 --> 01:01:25,899
The fuel will still be pumped in
at a high pressure...

819
01:01:25,900 --> 01:01:27,700
...and it'll burn in the chamber...

820
01:01:27,701 --> 01:01:30,800
...create the same exhaust gases
as the high-grade rocket fuel.

821
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:34,500
That should provide enough thrust
to send me into orbit.

822
01:01:35,500 --> 01:01:37,200
Make sense?

823
01:01:38,100 --> 01:01:39,900
Yeah. Yeah.

824
01:01:42,700 --> 01:01:43,800
Farmer?

825
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:47,800
- Yeah, I'm down here in the engine room.
- Hey.

826
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:52,600
- They made a ruling yet?
- Why do you think I'm here?

827
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:57,200
The committee wants 60 days
to make a ruling.

828
01:01:57,800 --> 01:02:01,399
But I don't have 60 days.
The bank's gonna foreclose in a week.

829
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:03,400
I'm aware of that.

830
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:12,799
- I just don't have that kind of time.
- That's their plan.

831
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:14,899
Do you think they want you
to launch this?

832
01:02:14,900 --> 01:02:16,499
They'll stall, stall, stall.

833
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:19,600
And then there'll be appeals.
This'll go on forever.

834
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,600
- Yeah.
- Are you ready for that?

835
01:02:39,300 --> 01:02:41,600
I'm sorry about the ruling, Farmer.

836
01:02:44,700 --> 01:02:45,900
Yeah.

837
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:53,700
You know, my father loved ranching.

838
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:57,800
He loved it with all his heart.

839
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:04,300
It was his dream.

840
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:12,100
Then when it got tough...

841
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:16,100
...and he knew they were gonna
try to take it away from him...

842
01:03:17,900 --> 01:03:20,600
...he put a gun to his head...

843
01:03:22,100 --> 01:03:24,300
...before they could.

844
01:03:29,500 --> 01:03:32,200
And that bullet's still traveling.

845
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:36,300
It just keeps on going.

846
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,900
And now it's headed
straight for my dream.

847
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:46,400
Just promise me
you're not gonna do something stupid.

848
01:03:46,700 --> 01:03:50,700
- Like what? Build a rocket?
- No.

849
01:03:51,100 --> 01:03:53,500
You know better than that.

850
01:03:55,900 --> 01:03:58,500
I've walked away before...

851
01:03:59,600 --> 01:04:02,100
...and I can't walk away again.

852
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:04,500
Charles?

853
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,700
I can't just keep failing.

854
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:11,700
I hope you understand that.

855
01:04:14,700 --> 01:04:17,099
I promise you everything will be okay.

856
01:04:17,100 --> 01:04:18,100
No.

857
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:24,400
Shepard!

858
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,000
Come on.

859
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:06,400
Damn!

860
01:06:08,100 --> 01:06:09,400
Charlie.

861
01:06:09,700 --> 01:06:11,300
Charlie, can you hear me?

862
01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:16,799
No, don't move. Don't move your body.
Don't move it, sweetie.

863
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:17,899
Oh, my God.

864
01:06:17,900 --> 01:06:21,900
Don't you dare leave this family.
You stay with me!

865
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:40,300
Six broken ribs. Broken left wrist.

866
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:43,399
Compound fracture to the fibula.

867
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:46,900
Severe head trauma.
Multiple lacerations to the face.

868
01:06:52,100 --> 01:06:54,300
Is there any good news?

869
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:57,600
He's alive.

870
01:07:35,700 --> 01:07:37,299
Hang on, hang on, hang on.

871
01:07:37,300 --> 01:07:40,300
You gotta be strong
for your daddy, now, okay?

872
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:45,900
Now, he wants to hear how much
we love him, okay? It's really important.

873
01:07:53,100 --> 01:07:54,200
You okay?

874
01:07:55,400 --> 01:07:58,600
Yeah? How about you?
You all right, sweetheart?

875
01:07:58,900 --> 01:08:00,899
Stanley?

876
01:08:00,900 --> 01:08:02,299
Come here, sweetheart.

877
01:08:02,300 --> 01:08:04,200
Why don't we go get
something to drink.

878
01:08:04,201 --> 01:08:05,700
Will you stay with him, honey?

879
01:08:06,100 --> 01:08:08,900
Stanley? Stanley. Honey.

880
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:26,400
Dad?

881
01:08:31,300 --> 01:08:33,700
It's Shep, Dad.

882
01:08:40,900 --> 01:08:43,600
I was looking in the barn today...

883
01:08:44,300 --> 01:08:47,599
...and we can build another one
just like it. I swear we can.

884
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:49,799
We have everything
right in there in the barn.

885
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:51,200
We could build everything.

886
01:08:51,201 --> 01:08:54,600
I swear, we can build another one
just like it. We just need you back.

887
01:08:58,500 --> 01:09:02,400
You can't give up. You can't give up.

888
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:28,500
And, children, when they say,
"Don't try this at home," they mean it.

889
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:32,199
Okay. Go ahead. Yeah. What? Okay.

890
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:35,299
Ask them how long they want us
to stay here. Ask them.

891
01:09:35,300 --> 01:09:38,899
Okay. Yeah. All right.

892
01:09:38,900 --> 01:09:41,100
They told us to hang tight.

893
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:47,500
Grab a couple of these mugs.
They make good souvenirs.

894
01:09:50,100 --> 01:09:51,400
There's no logo on them.

895
01:09:52,100 --> 01:09:56,699
The blending of high-test rocket fuel
is clearly not a project for amateurs.

896
01:09:56,700 --> 01:09:59,999
This is why we have such strict rules
and regulations in place.

897
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:03,300
Space flight is a serious endeavor,
not to be taken lightly.

898
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:07,399
We can only hope
that through this near-fatal tragedy...

899
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:09,800
...other space enthusiasts
get the real message...

900
01:10:09,801 --> 01:10:14,499
...displayed by Mr. Farmer here,
and not the one hyped up by the media.

901
01:10:14,500 --> 01:10:16,200
No further questions.

902
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,400
How stupid I am.

903
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:53,000
This a lecture
that you want me to hear?

904
01:10:53,900 --> 01:10:55,400
No.

905
01:10:57,800 --> 01:11:00,200
You're alive, stupid.

906
01:11:04,100 --> 01:11:06,700
They gotta get me some cereal.

907
01:11:51,100 --> 01:11:53,199
I'm going to the moon,
and I'm bringing...

908
01:11:53,200 --> 01:11:56,300
Oh, sweetie, let's not
play that game tonight, okay?

909
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:59,800
But why?

910
01:12:01,100 --> 01:12:03,600
Because she said so.

911
01:12:04,900 --> 01:12:06,000
Please, honey.

912
01:12:41,500 --> 01:12:43,000
It's okay.

913
01:12:43,900 --> 01:12:48,700
Shepard, you gotta give him some time.

914
01:12:51,500 --> 01:12:56,400
Daddy's real tired, you know?
He needs to... He needs to get some rest.

915
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:24,200
Albeit handwritten, your dad's will
is pretty straightforward.

916
01:13:24,700 --> 01:13:27,099
Three trust funds for the kids.

917
01:13:27,100 --> 01:13:30,700
After that, 200,000 in assets.
Another 100,000 in cash.

918
01:13:31,400 --> 01:13:33,800
Some stocks and bonds.

919
01:13:34,500 --> 01:13:36,300
It's all yours.

920
01:13:37,300 --> 01:13:39,900
Troubles with the bank are over, anyway.

921
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,500
Thank you.

922
01:14:17,400 --> 01:14:19,700
- Look, I found one!
- Look, I found one!

923
01:14:20,300 --> 01:14:22,100
That's good, baby.

924
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:29,900
- Look, I found one again!
- Look, I found one again!

925
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:42,500
Have them come get that rocket
and take it to the junkyard.

926
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:46,300
- Charles.
- Audie, it's already hurt them enough.

927
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:52,500
I don't want it
to hurt this family anymore.

928
01:15:07,500 --> 01:15:11,999
Well, everything is now current
and up-to-date.

929
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:15,599
I have stopped the foreclosure.
No worries.

930
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:17,000
Thanks, Arnie.

931
01:15:17,900 --> 01:15:19,900
You did the right thing.

932
01:15:21,700 --> 01:15:23,700
Oh, boy.

933
01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:28,300
Did Farmer have us all believing
he was going off into outer space.

934
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,100
How stupid do we look?

935
01:15:43,700 --> 01:15:45,100
What?

936
01:15:52,700 --> 01:15:54,499
When we took our vows...

937
01:15:54,500 --> 01:15:57,700
...we promised to love each other
in sickness and in health.

938
01:15:59,500 --> 01:16:04,200
Did that mean mental health?
Because you are crazy.

939
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:09,799
I mean, when you first said you wanted
to go into space, I thought:

940
01:16:09,800 --> 01:16:13,600
"Well, what man doesn't say
he wants his space?"

941
01:16:15,400 --> 01:16:16,800
The difference is, now...

942
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:19,500
...we have a family.

943
01:16:20,900 --> 01:16:23,900
A beautiful family.

944
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:27,100
And I see how the girls look at you.

945
01:16:28,500 --> 01:16:30,600
They adore you.

946
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:37,000
They love their daddy
who wants to go into space.

947
01:16:38,900 --> 01:16:42,900
I don't wanna be responsible
for killing that hope in their eyes.

948
01:16:43,700 --> 01:16:46,600
And what kind of message
would you be sending to Shepard?

949
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:51,900
I want his dad to show him
how it's done.

950
01:16:57,800 --> 01:16:59,300
Now, look.

951
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:09,600
There's enough money in there
for you to do whatever you need to do.

952
01:17:14,900 --> 01:17:16,200
Without the rocket...

953
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:20,000
...we're just a dysfunctional family.

954
01:17:51,100 --> 01:17:54,499
We'll rebuild the rocket
to the exact specifications as the original.

955
01:17:54,500 --> 01:17:57,699
I've inventoried all materials on hand.
Awaiting delivery on...

956
01:17:57,700 --> 01:17:59,900
Three spherical oxygen bottles.

957
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:04,399
- Three thousand linear feet of 20-gauge...
- Unlike the first launch...

958
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:06,099
...this fuel will burn evenly...

959
01:18:06,100 --> 01:18:08,999
...giving us the right amount of thrust
needed to launch...

960
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:13,400
- Twenty MCM submodule components.
- Lithium hydroxide canisters...

961
01:18:15,700 --> 01:18:19,700
- There are plenty of alternative fuels.
- We have to find them legitimately.

962
01:18:20,100 --> 01:18:25,100
The altitude would be 100 miles
and the speed would be 25,000...

963
01:18:25,700 --> 01:18:27,800
Fire-protective fabric.

964
01:18:33,200 --> 01:18:35,500
- Test.
- Testing.

965
01:18:37,400 --> 01:18:40,699
The rocket will be launched from the barn,
heading 72.51 degrees...

966
01:18:40,700 --> 01:18:43,200
Five thousand linear feet 30-gauge...

967
01:18:45,100 --> 01:18:47,100
Two hundred linear feet...

968
01:18:51,700 --> 01:18:54,699
Oxygen could last
three times longer than needed...

969
01:18:54,700 --> 01:18:57,000
...but let's not put that to the test.

970
01:19:23,200 --> 01:19:26,700
You know, when you're a kid,
you wanna be just like your dad.

971
01:19:27,300 --> 01:19:29,299
Then when you're a teenager...

972
01:19:29,300 --> 01:19:32,000
...you don't wanna have
anything to do with him.

973
01:19:32,900 --> 01:19:35,800
Then when you grow up,
you end up just like him.

974
01:19:36,900 --> 01:19:40,300
My dad showed me one thing
when he died.

975
01:19:41,700 --> 01:19:44,700
He wasn't dying, he was giving up.

976
01:19:47,700 --> 01:19:53,700
No matter what happens to me today,
my children will see that I didn't give up.

977
01:19:55,200 --> 01:19:57,500
And I can die knowing that.

978
01:20:12,900 --> 01:20:14,900
Yeah.

979
01:20:17,300 --> 01:20:18,800
Man.

980
01:20:19,300 --> 01:20:21,800
We have been out here way too long.

981
01:20:28,700 --> 01:20:33,299
Okay. Yeah, okay. Okay.

982
01:20:33,300 --> 01:20:36,200
- What?
- Headquarters. Rocket Man's buying fuel.

983
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:39,899
Suspect Charles Farmer. Male Caucasian.

984
01:20:39,900 --> 01:20:42,699
Approximately 5'10", 170 pounds.

985
01:20:42,700 --> 01:20:47,700
Last seen in a brown Ford pickup
bearing east on Route 9.

986
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:08,099
Now, this launch is gonna take
all the strength...

987
01:21:08,100 --> 01:21:10,100
...and all the focus this family has.

988
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:13,800
You're my crew, my teammates.

989
01:21:16,200 --> 01:21:19,200
Well, thank you, honey.
I can use these, you know.

990
01:21:20,700 --> 01:21:25,200
- Is Daddy gonna come back?
- Yeah, I'm coming back.

991
01:21:25,700 --> 01:21:27,300
Don't you worry.

992
01:21:27,800 --> 01:21:31,700
- I love you, honey.
- I love you too.

993
01:21:37,400 --> 01:21:40,700
It'll be okay. Don't you worry.

994
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:48,700
I love you guys.

995
01:21:52,500 --> 01:21:53,899
Now, Shepard.

996
01:21:53,900 --> 01:21:57,799
If anything's gonna go wrong,
it'll go wrong in the first 10 minutes.

997
01:21:57,800 --> 01:22:00,099
- After that, I'll be airborne.
- Dad...

998
01:22:00,100 --> 01:22:03,100
It's okay. I'm not worried about you.

999
01:22:04,100 --> 01:22:07,200
- You can do it.
- All right.

1000
01:22:14,600 --> 01:22:16,100
Audie...

1001
01:22:17,300 --> 01:22:18,700
...it's gonna be okay.

1002
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:24,900
Please don't break my heart.

1003
01:22:26,200 --> 01:22:27,400
I won't.

1004
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,800
Step away from the vehicle!
Show me your hands!

1005
01:22:43,100 --> 01:22:45,700
Put your hands up! Let me see them!

1006
01:22:47,100 --> 01:22:49,699
- Right there, right there.
- Let me see those hands.

1007
01:22:49,700 --> 01:22:51,800
Turn around slowly.

1008
01:23:01,200 --> 01:23:03,600
I expect you home for dinner.

1009
01:23:06,700 --> 01:23:08,299
Dad, do you copy?

1010
01:23:08,300 --> 01:23:10,300
Now we look like asses.

1011
01:23:12,100 --> 01:23:13,100
Control Booth.

1012
01:23:13,500 --> 01:23:17,499
Preparation for launch underway.
Local temperature, 65 degrees.

1013
01:23:17,500 --> 01:23:20,700
Wind speed, four knots.
Opening canopy doors.

1014
01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:25,199
Cabin pressure holding 5.8.

1015
01:23:25,200 --> 01:23:27,800
Fuel and oxygen are steady.
Power still looks good.

1016
01:23:28,700 --> 01:23:30,600
Status is good.

1017
01:23:31,400 --> 01:23:33,600
Canopy doors cleared for launch.

1018
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:37,700
All remaining units
report to the Farmer residence.

1019
01:23:38,600 --> 01:23:40,799
- Ready for system check.
- Roger.

1020
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:44,800
Hydraulics okay. Fuel pressure's okay.
All systems go.

1021
01:23:45,100 --> 01:23:47,299
- Roger.
- Vessel restraints unlocked.

1022
01:23:47,300 --> 01:23:48,799
Ignition system on.

1023
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:54,300
Abort system on standby.
Cleared for launch at zero hour, 9 a.m.

1024
01:23:55,200 --> 01:23:56,800
Roger.

1025
01:23:58,300 --> 01:23:59,499
Ten...

1026
01:23:59,500 --> 01:24:00,600
...nine...

1027
01:24:01,200 --> 01:24:02,499
...eight...

1028
01:24:02,500 --> 01:24:05,099
...seven, six...

1029
01:24:05,100 --> 01:24:06,500
...five, four...

1030
01:24:07,400 --> 01:24:08,400
...three...

1031
01:24:08,700 --> 01:24:11,400
...two, one.

1032
01:24:43,200 --> 01:24:45,200
It's okay. It's okay.

1033
01:25:06,300 --> 01:25:07,800
Fuel is go.

1034
01:25:09,200 --> 01:25:10,500
- Go, Dad, go!
- Go, Dad!

1035
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,300
That is so huge.

1036
01:25:20,600 --> 01:25:22,800
Charlie Farmer.

1037
01:25:29,100 --> 01:25:31,599
Oxygen in the cabin is good.

1038
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:35,000
Pressure's holding.
The isolated battery's okay.

1039
01:25:37,700 --> 01:25:41,000
Everything's okay. Son of a bitch.

1040
01:25:58,200 --> 01:26:01,600
It's getting a little smoother.
A little smoother.

1041
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:11,500
Cut off, tower. Jettison green. Disarm.

1042
01:26:19,800 --> 01:26:21,900
Charles Farmer launched!

1043
01:26:25,400 --> 01:26:26,500
No, he didn't.

1044
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:58,800
Capsule separation, green, okay.

1045
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,300
We did it, Shepard!

1046
01:27:03,300 --> 01:27:05,100
We did it!

1047
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:08,400
We made it, Mom.

1048
01:27:31,800 --> 01:27:34,300
This is where the dreams live.

1049
01:27:51,500 --> 01:27:53,500
I'm up here.

1050
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:58,800
Africa.

1051
01:28:06,600 --> 01:28:08,600
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hi, Daddy.

1052
01:28:10,700 --> 01:28:13,300
God, I wish you were with me.

1053
01:28:14,200 --> 01:28:16,800
I wish you guys were here so bad.

1054
01:29:24,200 --> 01:29:27,900
Have you heard about this guy,
Charlie Farmer, who built his own rocket?

1055
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:31,300
Shepard.

1056
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:37,000
Shepard, can you hear me?

1057
01:29:39,400 --> 01:29:41,300
Shepard.

1058
01:29:45,800 --> 01:29:47,800
- Shepard?
- Dad.

1059
01:29:51,700 --> 01:29:53,200
Shepard.

1060
01:29:54,500 --> 01:29:56,400
Shepard, can you hear me?

1061
01:29:56,800 --> 01:29:58,500
Come on.

1062
01:30:02,700 --> 01:30:05,800
- Where is he?
- Dad, please come in.

1063
01:30:07,800 --> 01:30:09,900
- Dad, are you there? Dad?
- It's okay.

1064
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:25,400
Control Booth to Dreamer.
Control Booth to Dreamer. Are you there?

1065
01:30:25,700 --> 01:30:26,900
It's okay.

1066
01:30:55,900 --> 01:30:59,199
As you no doubt have heard,
there have been unsubstantiated rumors...

1067
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:01,800
...of an alleged launch
from somewhere in Texas.

1068
01:31:03,500 --> 01:31:07,399
And for whatever reason, this seems to be
attributed to our old friend Mr. Farmer.

1069
01:31:07,400 --> 01:31:11,999
We here at the FAA categorically deny
the existence of any launch.

1070
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:15,199
As far as we know,
Mr. Farmer is resting comfortably...

1071
01:31:15,200 --> 01:31:17,999
...probably watching
this press conference on television.

1072
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:21,900
Once again, no launch has taken place.

1073
01:31:22,500 --> 01:31:24,500
Your daddy's gonna come home soon.

1074
01:31:27,400 --> 01:31:30,000
So Dad launched at 0922.

1075
01:31:30,400 --> 01:31:36,299
So right now he's been in orbit
for eight hours, 56 minutes and 15 seconds.

1076
01:31:36,300 --> 01:31:41,099
Distance traveled so far
is 152,042 miles.

1077
01:31:41,100 --> 01:31:43,099
Well, when will he come back?

1078
01:31:43,100 --> 01:31:47,000
He may do 12 or 13 orbits
before he re-enters the Earth's atmosphere.

1079
01:31:47,800 --> 01:31:50,000
And if you figure that, then it...

1080
01:31:52,600 --> 01:31:54,000
What?

1081
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,700
Well, he could end up
running out of oxygen.

1082
01:32:20,200 --> 01:32:22,599
I still can't locate him, Mom.

1083
01:32:22,600 --> 01:32:24,500
Why don't you get some rest?

1084
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:28,400
- I can't, Mom. Dad needs me.
- That's an order.

1085
01:32:31,500 --> 01:32:33,300
I'm proud of you.

1086
01:32:51,300 --> 01:32:53,400
Say something, Farmer.

1087
01:33:30,500 --> 01:33:32,200
Shepard.

1088
01:33:33,400 --> 01:33:35,200
Come in, Shepard.

1089
01:33:36,800 --> 01:33:38,400
Shepard.

1090
01:33:38,800 --> 01:33:41,200
Shepard! Can you hear me?

1091
01:33:44,800 --> 01:33:46,300
Shepard!

1092
01:33:51,200 --> 01:33:52,900
Come on.

1093
01:33:54,200 --> 01:33:55,900
Come on.

1094
01:34:49,200 --> 01:34:50,300
Hello? Hello?

1095
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,400
This is the Astronaut Farmer.

1096
01:34:55,200 --> 01:34:57,200
- Come in, Mission Control.
- Dad, it's Shep!

1097
01:34:59,500 --> 01:35:01,200
Daddy! Daddy!

1098
01:35:02,500 --> 01:35:04,599
I think I'm gonna miss the back yard.

1099
01:35:04,600 --> 01:35:07,599
Don't worry. I'm setting up coordinates
for orbit nine to 10.

1100
01:35:07,600 --> 01:35:10,499
You don't wanna miss
this window for re-entry.

1101
01:35:10,500 --> 01:35:12,900
If readings are correct,
you're off by 20 percent.

1102
01:35:12,901 --> 01:35:15,899
- Preparing for re-entry.
- Re-entry is go.

1103
01:35:15,900 --> 01:35:18,800
Good luck.
We'll be watching for you, Dad.

1104
01:37:46,600 --> 01:37:48,600
Where can we take you?

1105
01:37:49,400 --> 01:37:50,900
Home.

1106
01:37:52,300 --> 01:37:54,500
- Hey, Dad.
- I made it! I made it!

1107
01:37:58,000 --> 01:37:59,000
Good job, son.

1108
01:38:01,500 --> 01:38:04,300
- I love you.
- My helmet.

1109
01:38:04,900 --> 01:38:06,000
I want that.

1110
01:38:07,800 --> 01:38:09,999
- And I want the rocket.
- I want that.

1111
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:11,999
Let's go to a restaurant to have pizza.

1112
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,700
Okay. We could go there too.

1113
01:38:47,600 --> 01:38:49,699
My next guest has an amazing story.

1114
01:38:49,700 --> 01:38:52,699
He's the only private citizen
ever to build his own rocket...

1115
01:38:52,700 --> 01:38:55,299
...orbit the Earth, and return safely.

1116
01:38:55,300 --> 01:38:57,499
As you know, he orbited nine times.

1117
01:38:57,500 --> 01:39:00,100
Please welcome Charlie Farmer.
Charlie, come on out here.

1118
01:39:03,200 --> 01:39:05,300
How are you, pal? Good to see you.

1119
01:39:09,500 --> 01:39:10,900
Have a seat.

1120
01:39:13,900 --> 01:39:15,300
Let me ask you something.

1121
01:39:15,301 --> 01:39:17,499
How does this go over
with the wife and kids?

1122
01:39:17,500 --> 01:39:20,099
Most guys I know can't
get a Harley out of the wife.

1123
01:39:20,100 --> 01:39:23,299
You know what I'm saying?
How do you get the rocket?

1124
01:39:23,300 --> 01:39:26,099
I know it might sound like baloney...

1125
01:39:26,100 --> 01:39:30,100
...but my wife and kids were real supportive
of the whole thing all the way around.

1126
01:39:30,400 --> 01:39:33,799
How do you know you were
physically up to this? It's been a while...

1127
01:39:33,800 --> 01:39:36,299
I did some tests on myself.

1128
01:39:36,300 --> 01:39:39,099
I know they have that big...
What is that? The cyclotron?

1129
01:39:39,100 --> 01:39:42,099
What do you do, run around a tree
with a rope? What do you do?

1130
01:39:42,100 --> 01:39:43,599
See what I'm saying?

1131
01:39:43,600 --> 01:39:48,099
I didn't really have the equipment
that NASA might require.

1132
01:39:48,100 --> 01:39:51,299
So I just had to make up
my own tests, but...

1133
01:39:51,300 --> 01:39:55,300
You think they will clamp down on people?
Will people be allowed to do this after you?

1134
01:39:55,700 --> 01:39:59,299
You know, I was fine
when I was building the rocket.

1135
01:39:59,300 --> 01:40:03,099
It's when I ordered the 10,000 pounds
of rocket fuel...

1136
01:40:03,100 --> 01:40:05,899
-...that the FBI...
- Well, yeah, that'd do it.

1137
01:40:05,900 --> 01:40:09,299
- The FBI came around to say hello to me.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1138
01:40:09,300 --> 01:40:12,699
I know all the government people,
the NASA people, were against you.

1139
01:40:12,700 --> 01:40:14,899
Once this looked like
it was gonna happen...

1140
01:40:14,900 --> 01:40:17,399
...were they pulling for you
or feeling resistance?

1141
01:40:17,400 --> 01:40:18,999
Well, I'll put it this way.

1142
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:22,999
To be up there
and look back down here at us...

1143
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:25,599
- ...it makes it all worth it.
- Well, you did it.

1144
01:40:25,600 --> 01:40:27,400
Godspeed to you, Charlie. Great job.

1145
01:40:27,401 --> 01:40:30,500
Charlie Farmer will be right back,
right after this.
