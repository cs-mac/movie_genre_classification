1
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,438
<i>Stay with us for
blood-chilling suspense...</i>

2
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,398
<i>...blackmail, murder,
intrigue and love.</i>

3
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,516
<i>Next on Channel 8.</i>

4
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,148
<i>-a tourist, visiting a friend,
was struck...</i>

5
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:08,630
<i>...by a 30-pound block as he
walk ed down the stage-door alley.</i>

6
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,394
<i>The cinder block hit me
on the flat side...</i>

7
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:14,074
<i>...of the block itself,
as if it were hurled at me.</i>

8
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,435
<i>-when the ferry dock ed,
he was napping.</i>

9
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:20,752
<i>A deck hand wok e him and told him
to drive off. But Max was in reverse.</i>

10
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,992
<i>He went right off the back of the ferry.
He drowned.</i>

11
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:27,357
<i>But if you were complaining
about the weather this week end...</i>

12
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,954
<i>...it could have been worse.
A series of floods...</i>

13
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,588
-I guess it's that time.
-You want any help?

14
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:37,516
There was a terrific recipe for capon
in the Times today.

15
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,996
Takes two minutes.

16
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,271
<i>The National Guard has been
called out...</i>

17
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,351
<i>...and some people may have to-</i>

18
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:15,117
Enid, someone's moving into
the Warren place.

19
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,793
So?

20
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,235
It's a funny time to be moving.

21
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,075
I don't see any kids' stuff.

22
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,839
Thank God.

23
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,998
Maybe we should ask them over
for a drink tonight.

24
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,317
-It being their first night and all.
-Tomorrow will be fine.

25
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,675
Well, tomorrow's not tonight,
you know.

26
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,877
-And it would be nice.
-There's plenty of time to be nice.

27
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,031
You don't have to push it.

28
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,949
I think they've got a dog.

29
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:26,476
Kalinqashe, the dog spirit,
is swift and faithful.

30
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:30,838
I don't care. I don't want him
in my garden digging up my bulbs.

31
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:34,118
Who would want your bulbs?

32
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,751
Hello.

33
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:39,196
-What can I do for you?
-Anything you like.

34
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,272
The question is,
what do you want in return?

35
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,715
Hi. I'm Ramona.
I just moved in next door.

36
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:54,838
-Oh, really?
-Really.

37
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,871
Who's this?

38
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:05,113
-Your girlfriend?
-No, that's my daughter, Elaine.

39
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,550
That's a hot one.

40
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,029
By the way, my name is Earl Keese.

41
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,914
I was real friendly
with a boy named Earl once.

42
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,989
Well, twice really.

43
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,880
So you're all moved in next door, huh?

44
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:40,191
It's a very good house. I imagine
you'll want to freshen it up.

45
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,351
Give it a new coat of paint,
mow the lawn.

46
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,999
Is your wife here?

47
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,793
She's in the kitchen.

48
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,913
-She's dying to meet you. I'll get her.
-No, no, I don't want to meet her.

49
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,514
I hope we're gonna be friends.

50
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,431
We were very friendly
with the Warrens next door.

51
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,711
But we weren't that close.

52
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,036
I mean, we were next-door close.

53
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:06,155
I didn't mean that kind of close.
I mean "close" close.

54
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,472
Is your wife making dinner?

55
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,590
She's fixing a great capon.

56
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:14,149
It was in the Times today.

57
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,631
Would you Like to stay for dinner?

58
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,155
Are there more of you?

59
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,590
Is there a Mr. Ramona?

60
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:25,274
You go ask your wife if it's okay.

61
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:28,074
No, it's no problem, really.

62
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,798
Don't argue with me, Earl.

63
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,953
You wouldn’t want me
to have to pull down your pants...

64
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,633
...and spank your little buns...

65
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,353
...would you?

66
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,674
Don't you go away. I'll be right back.

67
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,913
Okay?

68
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:07,154
-How many frozen waffles you want?
-Waffles? What happened to the capon?

69
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,151
-What capon?
-You said you read...

70
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:12,676
-... an incredible recipe for it.
-I didn't say we were having it.

71
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,235
Leave it to you
to take something for granted.

72
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,277
Frozen waffles is all we've got.

73
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,150
Weren't you gonna pick up steaks
for tomorrow?

74
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,878
You're asking for steak?

75
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:24,349
You could have picked up
some cheap ones.

76
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,750
I will not eat cheap meat.

77
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,873
<i>No! No!</i>

78
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:49,080
-May I help you?
-Hi, Earl. I'm Vic.

79
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,999
I'm sure Ramona's already told you
my whole life story.

80
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:56,153
<i>-No, but you must be her...
-That's me, Like it or not.</i>

81
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,790
If you know what I mean. Have a seat.

82
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,718
So, what do you say, neighbor?

83
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,429
Welcome to the end of the road,
I guess.

84
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,153
-It's a great house.
-Thank you.

85
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,995
I mean mine. More rooms than we
need, really, but I couldn’t resist.

86
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,229
It was a steal.

87
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,391
What's on the menu, pal?
I'm starved.

88
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:22,115
We haven't eaten all day. We could eat
a baby's butt through a park bench.

89
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:25,352
I'm afraid I spoke too soon earlier.

90
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:28,398
We haven't got enough.
Enid didn't get to her shopping today.

91
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,154
Well, no sweat.
I'll just go and get some takeout.

92
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:34,357
There's nothing around here
except the standard burgers...

93
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:37,398
-... greasy dogs and a gummy pizza.
-I can do better than that.

94
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:40,074
You just leave everything
to Captain Vic.

95
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:45,237
Look, friend, if I do the running,
I know you’ll wanna spring for the tab.

96
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,399
Okay.

97
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,916
Thirty bucks?
For four grown people?

98
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:01,834
Where have you been? It takes
30 bucks just to look at a menu.

99
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:07,159
-This is a $2 bill.
-Let me see that.

100
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,436
Gee, I thought it was a 20.

101
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,071
-Really.
-Well, people palm them off that way.

102
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:16,437
You never know who's gonna
stick it to you, do you, Earl?

103
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:20,513
Look, if 32 bucks isn't enough,
we can always do it some other night.

104
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,513
Why don't we do it now.
Let's have your car keys, okay?

105
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,399
-My car keys?
-Yeah, my brakes are shot.

106
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,950
Why don't I get the food? I'm the one
who's supposed to be neighborly.

107
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,714
You stay here and my wife
will keep you company.

108
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:37,152
Forget it. If you insist on paying for
dinner, the least I can do is go get it.

109
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,909
What I don't understand
is where you're going.

110
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,877
There's no place decent around here.

111
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:45,430
If you must know, it's a new place,
opened up on the other side of town.

112
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,398
Near the train station.
Across from the warehouse.

113
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,118
Italian.

114
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,312
I commute, I go by there twice a day,
five days a week...

115
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,835
...and I've never seen
a restaurant around there.

116
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,037
You calling me a liar?

117
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,792
<i>No, I...</i>

118
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,668
I'm just not very observant,
I guess.

119
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,752
I can't blame you.
They don't have their sign up yet.

120
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:10,595
But it's got a cute name:
Caesar's Garlic Wars.

121
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,754
Okay. Why don't you
get some ravioli...

122
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,559
...and some- What do you
call those stuffed clams?

123
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:22,316
-Stuffed clams.
-Yeah. And some scampi and garlic.

124
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,392
Whatever I get, Earl,
I first have to get going.

125
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,357
I'll get the keys.

126
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,800
Why don't you stay here
and make yourself at home.

127
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,916
I'll be right here.

128
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,238
Hi.

129
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,677
Took a bath. There's a dead rat
in our tub over there.

130
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,156
Vic said not to move it.

131
00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:00,355
Took a pill. Moving always makes me
kind of hyper.

132
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,871
I hope you don't mind.

133
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,516
Yeah. Sure. I don't mind.

134
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,910
Oh, you do mind, don't you?

135
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,435
Vic's going out for Italian food.

136
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:16,434
You come down and join us
whenever you can, okay?

137
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,795
What are you so nervous about, Earl?

138
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,680
<i>Afraid Vic will think you're up here...</i>

139
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,791
...chewing me?

140
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,393
What are you doing? Robbing me?

141
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,279
Looking for a pencil to write down
what you want for supper.

142
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,839
You got a pencil in your hand.

143
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,958
$327. Is that all you had
at the end of last month?

144
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,714
That's none of your business.
Stay out of there, please.

145
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,839
-I just wanted to get the order right.
-Why don't we go downstairs.

146
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,359
Sure.

147
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,272
After you.

148
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,355
-So, what do you want?
-Make it simple.

149
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:11,115
Spaghetti, meatballs, a salad.
Whatever you want for you and-

150
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,669
What's not simple
is how I get to the restaurant.

151
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:16,400
-Use my car.
-Has it got a key or a rubber band...

152
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,835
-... you wind up?
-Why don't I go with you.

153
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,117
Afraid I'll steal your car?
That's why I moved in next door?

154
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:25,078
So I could rip off your car
and move somewhere else?

155
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,919
-There you go.
-Back in a flash, pal.

156
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:01,910
Waffles are browning.
Always a thrilling sight.

157
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,911
Good news, Enid.

158
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,634
Italian food is on the way.

159
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,679
You arranged it?

160
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:11,593
Well, more or less.
I invited the neighbors.

161
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,557
Oh, you met them.

162
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,599
What did you think?

163
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,149
Earl?

164
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,799
They're...

165
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,352
...different.

166
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:41,076
I guess I'll go up and get dressed.

167
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,959
Upstairs?

168
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,633
What for?

169
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,913
You said they were coming over.

170
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,548
Well, they're not dressing.
They're barely dressed.

171
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,952
I mean, you could go
in the kitchen and set the table.

172
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,476
And turn the waffles off.
I'll be there in a minute to help you.

173
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:01,279
You got lots to do down here.

174
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,034
Yeah, there is something I forgot to do.

175
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:08,033
That's a boy.
You want some steak?

176
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:08,439
Don't tell me, you must be
our new neighbor. Come on in.

177
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,556
Thanks a lot.

178
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,991
Someone's stolen our truck...

179
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,469
...and I need to use the phone
to call the police.

180
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,757
Use the phone in the kitchen.
What a terrible thing, your first day.

181
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,559
It's even worse than just that.
Baby was in the back.

182
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,598
-Oh, my.
-Oh! Oh! Oh!

183
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,718
Vic. Your baby's drowning!

184
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:38,348
No chance.
Why should my dog be drowning?

185
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,519
Dog?

186
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:42,914
I thought "child. "

187
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,913
We haven't any children.
Unless Ramona just pumped one out...

188
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,913
...and didn't tell me.
She calls the dog " Baby. "

189
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:51,514
-She calls the dog " Baby"?
-Yeah. He's fine.

190
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:54,194
I just saw him around the back there.
When I drove up.

191
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:56,555
He's digging up something
in your flowerbed.

192
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,994
My flowerbed?

193
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,399
Hi, Enid.

194
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,477
Hi, Vic.

195
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,193
Oh, we met hours ago.

196
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:12,794
Earl here was worried about Baby.

197
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,679
Oh, he's no trouble at all.
He's a perfect gentleman.

198
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:19,628
-Leave him with me any time you want.
-Don't worry, I will.

199
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,194
They spoil him awfully.

200
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:25,239
I want him to have every advantage
I was denied as a young dog.

201
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,868
Well, here are your keys, Mr. Keese.

202
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:31,875
Let's dig into this stuff
before the sauce turns into penicillin.

203
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:35,069
Why don't you Look for Ramona.

204
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:38,792
-Me?
-Finders keepers, Earl. After all...

205
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,520
...I know what goes on out here
in the suburbs.

206
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,036
That's why we moved here.

207
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,353
Oh, Vic.

208
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:55,958
-What do you think, Earl?
-Don't do that. You are outrageous.

209
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,589
Too bad about Vic's truck, Earl.

210
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:16,035
Well, I was just pushing it
into my garage...

211
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,794
...to hide it from him, you know,
kind of a joke.

212
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,758
-It was an accident.
-It could happen to anybody.

213
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,951
I think 1500 should take care of it.

214
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:26,588
Fifteen hundred? Dollars?

215
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:30,839
It was just a joke. I mean, I'm sure
your insurance will cover most of it...

216
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,958
...and I'll pay the deductible.
What is it, 100 or so?

217
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:38,636
For the truck.
Keeping me quiet is a little extra.

218
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,432
I don't believe it.

219
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,039
You're blackmailing me.

220
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,634
Hey, what are neighbors for?

221
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,116
Oh, make it cash.

222
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:04,997
Hey, come on in, buddy.
Help yourself.

223
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,954
Well, here we all are.

224
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,634
To Vic and Ramona.

225
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,394
For bringing a breath of fresh air
to our neighborhood.

226
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:35,075
May we have many, many years
of your lovely company.

227
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,832
Do they have any country fairs here?

228
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,913
Where they do things Like see
which bull has the biggest balls?

229
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:54,791
This isn't really country. It's more
a suburban bedroom community.

230
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,952
The locals are in service trades.
They're not farmers.

231
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,991
Maybe we can measure their balls.

232
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,078
Or we could start with yours,
if you Like.

233
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,428
Good, is it?

234
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:18,954
-Delicious.
-I must call Caesar's...

235
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,678
...and compliment the chef.

236
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,474
Tell me, were they crowded
this evening?

237
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,193
-What?
-Caesar's.

238
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,669
Friday night, the only place in town.

239
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:30,513
Bet they were turning them away
in droves.

240
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,796
Okay, you probably
called the place...

241
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,599
...and found out they're not open
for business yet, right?

242
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,079
Right.

243
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,630
So does that make me a liar?

244
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,870
Maybe I got there,
saw the place was closed...

245
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,156
...and went somewhere else
to pick up the food.

246
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:47,039
Where? Everything's shut at this hour.
Everything.

247
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,713
-And the wine?
-What's the matter?

248
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,792
Vic brings a wonderful dinner
and you give him the third degree.

249
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:54,190
I don't mind.
There's no mystery about it.

250
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:57,716
You know Valley Field Mall on Route 3?
Across from the Cinema Cineplex?

251
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:00,354
There's a small spaghetti and wine
dealership there.

252
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,033
Next to the Singer Sewing Centre.

253
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,839
That's where you got it?

254
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,673
That's right.

255
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,800
Well, to begin with,
Valley Field Mall is closed.

256
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:12,633
When it was open, it was
on Route 15, not Route 3.

257
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:15,109
And there can't be
a small spaghetti dealership...

258
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,874
...next to the Singer Centre
across from the Cineplex...

259
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:22,318
...because there is no Cineplex
and there is no Singer Sewing Centre.

260
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:27,238
All right, I can deceive you no longer.

261
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,351
Yes, yes, yes, I admit it.

262
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,397
It was me who prepared this meal...

263
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:34,358
...to share on our
first night together as neighbors.

264
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:38,628
This was my crime. Mixing up
a special batch of my Aunt Minota's...

265
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,109
...secret, sacred spaghetti sauce.

266
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:43,550
Sorry I messed up your evening. Right?

267
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,199
Right.

268
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:48,632
In light of Earl’s feelings,
I think it would be best if we left.

269
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:54,158
Oh, no, no. Sit down, sit down.
Let's finish this magnificent meal.

270
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,993
Don't worry about Earl.
He'll get over his feelings.

271
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:00,119
-He spurned my sauce.
-No, he loves your sauce.

272
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:02,271
He's just jealous, he can't cook.

273
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:06,597
Earl, isn't it your turn
to do a Little confessing?

274
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,680
-What?
-Vic's been man enough to admit...

275
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:13,071
...he was the one who cooked supper.
You've got nothing to say?

276
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:17,673
I don't think that'll be necessary.
We do have an agreement, don't we?

277
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,197
I'm talking about what you did outside.

278
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:26,671
Yes, Ramona. I know and I accept
the figures you mentioned.

279
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,550
" Figures," Earl? What "figures"?

280
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:33,269
Just a Little arrangement
I have with Ramona.

281
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,596
What sort of arrangement?

282
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,519
Oh, boy.

283
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:42,069
We're waiting.
Or do I have to pound it out of you?

284
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,310
Don't speak to me Like that
in my own house.

285
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:46,551
-Why would I?
-You just did.

286
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,951
-It's just a something a guy says.
-I never say it.

287
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,594
-I don't blame you.
-Ramona...

288
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:55,997
...why don't you be man enough
to tell us since Earl isn't.

289
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,798
He tried to pork me.

290
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,392
Pork you? What?!

291
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,352
You know you did.

292
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,715
I swear, I never touched her.

293
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:11,354
Well, I wasn't born
with your hand in my bush.

294
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:14,031
Enid, help me.

295
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,873
Tell them I couldn’t
do something Like that.

296
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:20,835
-Let's Leave that to the police.
-Vic, she's not my type.

297
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:26,914
Enid, you tell Earl he'll have
a chance to defend himself.

298
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:31,788
I think you can see
why we have to Leave.

299
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,833
I know you meant well.
Didn't you?

300
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:37,595
We might have had
a wonderful relationship.

301
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,274
But then, as Arthur Bremer once said:

302
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:44,232
" How many things go right
in this crazy world?"

303
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,990
Ramona, let's go.

304
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,638
Come on, before he gets dangerous.

305
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:55,152
-I thought I'd be able to defend myself!
-Not so loud, Earl.

306
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:58,790
Afraid we'll disturb the neighbors?
These are the goddamn neighbors!

307
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,474
Calm yourself, Earl.
I'm not gonna take you to court.

308
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:04,598
That would make for bad blood.
We don't want any bad blood...

309
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:09,072
<i>...especially since we’ll be living
next door to you for a long, Long time.</i>

310
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,755
I swear to God, Enid,
we may have to move.

311
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,592
They're very strange people.

312
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,320
You know how after five minutes
when you meet someone...

313
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,072
...you know everything about them?

314
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,879
What they do, their last name.
We know nothing about them.

315
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:28,157
-So what?
-So why didn't you say something?

316
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,788
You were in the house the whole time
she was here.

317
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,520
Besides, you know how Long it takes
to pork someone?

318
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,910
No, how Long does it take, Earl?

319
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:38,310
Are you saying you believe her?

320
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,153
Enid, I'm the same man
you've known for 16 years.

321
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,232
I know.

322
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,516
What the hell's going on around here?

323
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:48,035
He comes waltzing in
and you say, " Hi, Vic. "

324
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:51,670
-How did you know his name?
-He came over this afternoon.

325
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,871
I didn't have a chance to tell you.

326
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:57,555
-You could’ve told me in the car.
-You know we never talk in the car.

327
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,597
Today you could’ve made an exception.

328
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:03,196
That house next door is empty
for six months and you meet...

329
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:06,477
...the new occupants before I do,
and you don't say anything?

330
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:09,598
-Enid, am I being unreasonable?
-Pass the wine.

331
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:12,157
Did you tell me everybody
you met today?

332
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:15,073
I didn't meet anyone today.
I never meet anyone.

333
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:17,674
A new neighbor’s
a bit different, isn't it?

334
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,115
A new neighbor whose unit
we can stare at.

335
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:23,477
-I wasn't staring at his unit.
-I saw you, Enid.

336
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:26,871
I don't care what other wives do,
only the one I'm married to.

337
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:29,315
I know when a woman's
checking out a man's unit.

338
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:32,711
-Oh, really?
-Yeah, Vic's wife, that Ramona.

339
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,678
She did it to me, practically
unzipped my fly with her eyes.

340
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,239
And you hated it, right?

341
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:40,312
How many stiff nips
did you check out at the office today?

342
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:44,029
I know you, Earl, your eyes
never sit still for a minute.

343
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:46,351
Why'd you give their dog our steak?

344
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,670
I saw you, behind my back.

345
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,673
I was afraid you wouldn’t approve.

346
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,673
You were afraid right,
I can tell you that.

347
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,238
What could I do?

348
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,550
Vic asked me
to Look after Baby for a while.

349
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:03,315
But steak? Jesus, why didn't you
stuff money into his mouth?

350
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,436
And 32 bucks for this load of crap?

351
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,636
It's his money.

352
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,835
Baby! Oh, my God! Baby!

353
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,116
Get that thing away from that thing!

354
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,868
What happened?

355
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:24,918
Baby was over by that thing
taking a leak.

356
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,996
Jesus Christ.

357
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:33,515
Come, Baby. Come.

358
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:38,039
Come here. Come here.

359
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,597
He's all right.

360
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,393
Sweetie, where's the truck?

361
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:02,028
Maybe that thing got our truck
Like Earl got me.

362
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:05,158
Relax with that stuff. Our boy here
has been through enough.

363
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:09,074
We really had you going there.
Ramona's such an imp.

364
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:13,153
We were just kind of putting you on
at supper. Like a Little joke.

365
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:17,108
A joke? You call accusing me
of parking Ramona a joke?

366
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:20,556
Oh, what's the matter with you, Earl?
Can't you take a joke?

367
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:24,838
Let's go, Ramona, come in the house.
It's Friday night. I'll buy you a drink.

368
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,634
Yeah, I can take a joke, Enid!

369
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:31,274
-Can you take a joke, Vic?
-Any joke you dish up.

370
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,759
-Oh, yeah?
-Well, try me.

371
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,399
-I sank your truck.
-What?

372
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:38,155
I didn't mean to. I lost control after
I moved the brick from under your tire.

373
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,880
You touched my brick?
I told you I had no brakes.

374
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:43,110
I borrowed your car for the takeout.

375
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:46,909
-But you didn't go for takeout.
-Where's my truck and my airplane?

376
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:50,113
It's down in the swamp.
I'll go get my jacket.

377
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:53,637
We’ll get your jacket later.
You just take me to...

378
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,153
...the swamp.

379
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:09,835
Give me the Light, I'll lead the way.

380
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,560
You're pretty lucky,
having a swamp next to your house.

381
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,233
It didn't always smell this way.

382
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:17,597
When we moved in, it was a freshwater
Lake with fish and everything.

383
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:20,593
Then the Interstate Chemical
began dumping upstream...

384
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:23,149
...and weird things started to grow.

385
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:27,073
I haven't been here since the search
party a couple years ago.

386
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,639
Search party?

387
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,631
Yeah.

388
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:33,480
Some guy disappeared down here.

389
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:37,117
A lineman from the power company.
Said it was quicksand.

390
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:40,033
Quicksand, this part of the country?
No way.

391
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,633
That's what I said.

392
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,269
Vic!

393
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,709
Vic!

394
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:48,194
Vic, help me. Please help me!

395
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:51,358
Do you feel my truck in there?

396
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:53,988
Vic, come on, help me.
I'll buy you a new truck.

397
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:58,039
Not Like that one. How about my
triplane? How you gonna replace that?

398
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:01,518
Help, please.
I'm being sucked down.

399
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:04,553
-Maybe it's best that way.
-What are you talking about?

400
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:07,149
You're not the ideal neighbor.
You sank my truck...

401
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:09,788
...you insulted my sauce
and you violated Ramona.

402
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,197
-You said it was just a joke.
-But she was in your bathtub.

403
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:15,237
No, she wasn't.
She was in the bed.

404
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:18,113
And that is where
you saw her mammae.

405
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:21,118
-Her mammal?
-Her honkers, Earl.

406
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,594
She dropped the towel.

407
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:25,752
Did she drop it,
or did you psychically will it to fall?

408
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:29,230
-"Will it to fall"?
-Did you will her towel to fall?

409
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,714
No.

410
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,791
Never. No.

411
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:36,153
Admit it, Earl.
They'll go easier on you if you do.

412
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:39,835
<i>Will it to fall?
Well... No, I don't think so.</i>

413
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,393
Come on, Earl.

414
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:45,032
-Well, maybe a Little.
-Come on.

415
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,713
Yes! Yes!

416
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:49,150
-Okay, I admit it.
-Admit what?

417
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:53,435
Yes. I willed the towel to fall!

418
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:01,910
Grab on. Earl Keese, come on up.

419
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:05,556
See, all I wanted was a Little honesty
in our relationship, buddy.

420
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:07,790
You'd want the
same thing, right, pal?

421
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:17,078
Vic.

422
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,631
Vic.

423
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:23,357
Don't kid around.

424
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,713
Come on up. Vic!

425
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,231
Vic, I'm sorry.
Vic, come back, Vic!

426
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,714
Vic, come back.

427
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:47,199
Forgive me, Vic.

428
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,589
Forgive me.

429
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,312
Oh, my God.

430
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:51,917
I must be seeing things.

431
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,596
So there was this Indian and-

432
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:42,994
Oh, God!

433
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:46,436
Jesus! Get out of here!
Get out!

434
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,836
Get out of my house!

435
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:52,752
You're certifiable!
You and that woman!

436
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:56,311
You're nuts!
You're a maniac! Get out!

437
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,668
God, does it always
shrivel up when you shower?

438
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,598
Great.

439
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:31,354
Now it's your turn
to annoy me, right?

440
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:35,633
I was looking for Baby. You haven't
seen him, have you? He kills chickens.

441
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:39,158
Well, I don't keep
chickens in the shower.

442
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:50,429
-This is pretty.
-Please don't touch them.

443
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,518
Put them back on the shelf.

444
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,750
Snippy.

445
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:06,352
Your left ball
in the corner pocket.

446
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,389
Sorry, Earl.

447
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:20,392
I started collecting them
when I was 9 years old.

448
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:23,638
Hey, you kids,
keep it down to a dull roar.

449
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:26,030
I'm not cleaning up
down there again, Earl.

450
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,952
What's happening, gang?

451
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:33,119
Hi, Vic.
Come on in and join the party.

452
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,476
I gotta go upstairs, be right back.

453
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:38,359
I gotta get a broom
to sweep up all this junk.

454
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,192
Get a Little rough with you, did he?

455
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:41,349
Hey!

456
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,439
Earl. Hey, Earl.

457
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:49,797
-Go to hell. You're not getting back in.
-You locked them in?

458
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:52,918
They're a couple of cases.
They're fruitcakes, lunatics.

459
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:57,073
-Both of them. They're hazardous, Enid.
-Enid. You in there, honey?

460
00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:01,756
Right here, Captain Vic.
You can't keep them prisoners, Earl.

461
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:05,754
I'm gonna call the locksmith.
They can let them out the side door.

462
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,234
Hello, Chic. It's Earl.

463
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,755
<i>-Earl. Earl who?
-No jokes, will you?</i>

464
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,672
<i>I need the name of that locksmith.</i>

465
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:14,991
I broke a key and I got
two Lunatics Locked in my basement.

466
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:18,192
What? What did you say?

467
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,789
-Blow it out your ass.
-Is somebody on this line?

468
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,992
-Just you and me, asshole.
-The bastard's on the phone.

469
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,957
<i>-You called me, didn't you?
-Not you.</i>

470
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,553
-Me.
-Get off the line, Vic.

471
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:29,153
<i>-Who's Vic?
-He lives next door.</i>

472
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:31,311
<i>-Nobody lives next door.
-That's right.</i>

473
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,272
<i>-Christ.
-Earl, you been drinking?</i>

474
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:36,113
-What the hell is going on?
-Never mind, forget it.

475
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:38,356
And don't ever call here again.

476
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:42,757
Oh, really, Earl. Grow up.

477
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:47,550
-Vic, stop!
-Please, you promised me. Please.

478
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:50,917
-Your leg. Just one Leg.
-It's a trick.

479
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:53,469
You are pitiful, Earl.
How do you know it's a trick?

480
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:57,599
-You always go limp in a crisis.
-It's not a crisis, it's a trick.

481
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:01,673
How do you know Vic
isn't an escaped vivisectionist?

482
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,632
A vivisectionist!

483
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,551
Ramona!

484
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,955
Are you still in one piece?

485
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:31,911
Come on, kids.

486
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,312
Fun's fun.

487
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:45,235
All right. Game's over.

488
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:51,711
Enid!

489
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:53,518
Enid!

490
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:24,832
Greavy's Garage.

491
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,156
I'm sorry to be calling you
at this hour.

492
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:31,399
It don't matter. We're open 24 hours.
All day, all damn night. What you need?

493
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:32,913
<i>I'm at number 2 Burt Street.</i>

494
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:37,193
I need somebody to Let me out of my
basement, and a tow truck immediately.

495
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:39,152
Ain't that damn truck there yet?

496
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:41,880
I sent my boy Perry out there
five minutes ago.

497
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:44,275
<i>Some fella named Vic called up.</i>

498
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:45,874
You're kidding.

499
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:50,835
Yeah, I'm kidding. I stay up all night
so I can wank my crank on the phone.

500
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:53,959
Wait a minute.

501
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:08,509
<i>-He just got here.
-That fella Vic...</i>

502
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:10,875
<i>...says you run his truck
down the swamp.</i>

503
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:12,996
Locked him and
his missus in a root cellar.

504
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:15,515
-It was kind of a joke.
-A joke?

505
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:19,275
What the hell kind of joke is that?
It's as funny as a gutful of pinworms.

506
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:22,352
<i>-Who ask ed your opinion?
-Who the hell has to, jack-off?</i>

507
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:24,949
Just because I lay under
your carpet that's insides...

508
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:27,759
...and because I snake your pipes
and drain your cesspool...

509
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:31,356
...don't make me dirt under your feet.
I'm as good as you any day, asshole.

510
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:35,678
If I didn't have to do this crap for a
living, I wouldn’t sell you my snot.

511
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:52,236
Enid.

512
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:16,396
It's Like a peashooter. I saw a guy
take three slugs from one of these.

513
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:18,676
-He just kept coming.
-I remember that.

514
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:20,910
-Be cool, brothers.
-Take it easy, guys.

515
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:23,719
-You too. Good night.
-Look who's home.

516
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:26,758
-Our daughter, the outlaw hitchhiker.
-Hi, Daddy.

517
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:30,674
-Elaine, what are you doing home?
-Got kicked out of school. I'm hungry.

518
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:34,958
We're gonna party with the neighbors.
Aren't they neat? I got some vodka.

519
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:36,878
-She got kicked out.
-Leave her alone.

520
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:38,951
Vic, what did you say
is in a pile driver?

521
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:42,590
Italian Galliano for passion,
Irish Mist for love and...

522
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:45,877
-... Russian vodka for endurance.
-Poor baby. Learn to relax.

523
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:48,231
Too much excitement's
no good for you.

524
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:52,598
Why don't you go upstairs,
take a hot bath, get into bed...

525
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:56,150
...and I'll come up to tuck
you in and help you go to sleep.

526
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:57,952
That's a good idea.

527
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:01,590
-I'll go in and say good night.
-That's a good boy.

528
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:03,552
We used to put
20 of them in there.

529
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:06,951
Activate the speed rollers, turn on
the hose circuits and that's it.

530
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:09,355
Vic Zeck's liquid lunch!

531
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:11,519
Good night, everybody.

532
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:14,670
I'm going to bed.

533
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:18,031
I bet you never seen
a pair of these before.

534
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:20,033
Take a sniff.

535
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:27,155
-It smells Like a peach.
-What are those?

536
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:29,231
They're my panties. They're edible.

537
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:33,359
Edible. Hey, wow. The wonders of
modern petro technology.

538
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:36,751
-Where'd you get them?
-At school. All the kids have them.

539
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:39,510
-They're tasty.
-They come in four flavours.

540
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:42,148
-What a great idea.
-Yeah. Four flavors.

541
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:45,551
Earl, want some of your daughter's
panties? They come in four flavors.

542
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:49,110
Banana, peach, mint,
and, of course, cherry.

543
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:55,632
Good night, ladies.

544
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,829
You should have gone
up to bed Like I said.

545
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:06,754
Nice meeting you.
Good night, Enid.

546
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:18,193
-Nice, Earl. Good move.
-Guys, it's 2 in the morning.

547
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:20,351
Come on, you need some sleep.

548
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:23,677
Turn off the lights, Earl.

549
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:26,150
Two? 2:00?

550
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:29,438
Is that right? Can that be right?

551
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:06,034
What do you want?

552
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:10,199
Please Let me in, Earl.
I'll give you a kiss. Anyplace you Like.

553
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:12,709
Oh, Christ.

554
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:18,597
You've got no interest in me.
Why are you coming on to me?

555
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:22,349
We could have a real good time, Earl.
I don't care about your false teeth.

556
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:26,838
-I haven't got false teeth.
-I'm sorry. I guess they just Look false.

557
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:29,873
Look, what do you want from me?

558
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:35,034
Not just now, the whole thing.
You and Vic. Why?

559
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:39,233
Poor baby. I guess no one ever
tried to make friends with you before.

560
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:40,998
Here.

561
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:45,629
Earl, if you won't
Let me come in and play...

562
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:47,916
-... you come out and play with me.
-Earl.

563
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:49,513
-Just for a Little while.
-Earl.

564
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:52,234
-We can talk.
-Earl, are you down there?

565
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:54,192
Coming.

566
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:58,069
Wait. Stay here. I'll be right back.

567
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:09,391
Who were you
talking to down there?

568
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,597
Talking to? Nobody.

569
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:14,712
Well.

570
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:18,077
I'm gonna take a shower.

571
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:20,431
Whatever you say, Earl.

572
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:32,512
Ramona.

573
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:41,159
Ramona.

574
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:48,313
-Well, that was a huge waste of time.
-What do you want?

575
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:52,999
I give your car a good going-over,
a real good going-over.

576
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:57,153
And there's nothing wrong with it.
Not a damn thing. So I brung it back.

577
00:49:57,680 --> 00:49:59,910
I guess you had a
good laugh on me, huh?

578
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:02,469
-Pardon?
-Making a horse's patoot out of me.

579
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:05,234
-Yeah, huh?
-Wait. I didn't ask to have my...

580
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:08,710
...car hauled away. Someone
played a joke on both of us.

581
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:10,632
You're just full of jokes, aren't you?

582
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:13,837
Well, I think you're a dirty
shit sack, how about that?

583
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:42,678
Ramona.

584
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:58,273
Who goes there?

585
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:02,473
Hi. It's Earl Keese.

586
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:06,959
Oh, God!

587
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:12,758
Oh, God.

588
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:25,679
My God, I thought you were a prowler.
You all right?

589
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:27,876
-I guess so.
-You Look bad, Earl.

590
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:29,513
You sure you didn't get hit?

591
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:31,989
I don't know.
I've never been shot at before.

592
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:34,515
What were you doing out here?
What was that noise?

593
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:37,478
-What are you up to now?
-Nothing.

594
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:40,790
Bet you're Looking
for Ramona, aren't you?

595
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:44,993
-No.
-You're rooting around for Ramona.

596
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:49,914
I'm not rooting around.
She wanted to talk.

597
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:52,514
She wanted to talk?

598
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:56,190
Well, actually,
I wanted to talk to someone.

599
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:57,719
You wanna talk to me?

600
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,638
Sure.

601
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:10,070
Come on. Inside.

602
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:30,838
<i>Grab a seat,
I'll fix us some coffee.</i>

603
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:54,191
I feel terrible about your eye.

604
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:56,993
Couldn’t be helped.

605
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:04,154
What are you doing
with all that stuff on?

606
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:08,239
I was gonna take a dive in the swamp,
try to locate my truck and airplane.

607
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:19,874
I remember Mrs. Warren used
to bake bread in this kitchen.

608
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:23,430
I could smell the bread
all the way over at my house.

609
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:39,675
-Instant okay?
-Yeah.

610
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:58,592
Better get that fixed.

611
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:05,520
-Strong?
-Well, not too.

612
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:23,198
-I gotta rinse this out.
-And waste that coffee?

613
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:27,952
I'll just put it someplace
until I wash out the cup.

614
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:39,399
Sit down, Earl.

615
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:41,915
-I just want to-
-Sit down.

616
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:53,874
Now, just put the coffee powder
back in the cup.

617
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:05,670
-Can I wash my hand?
-No.

618
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:08,479
I thought you came over here to talk.

619
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:19,079
I Like mine tepid and black.
How about you?

620
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:20,793
Same.

621
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:37,759
Now you take back that cup you keep
switching, Earl. Or it'll be pump city.

622
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:42,748
Well, it makes no difference to me.

623
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:57,673
So.

624
00:55:58,120 --> 00:55:59,872
Here we are.

625
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:05,472
It's about your daughter,
Elaine, isn't it?

626
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:08,038
I thought so.

627
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:11,110
I'd say you got a
real problem there, Earl.

628
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:13,350
What are you talking about?
What do you mean?

629
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:15,397
Drugs. I can tell.

630
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:17,717
That spaced-out Look.

631
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:20,758
Used to see it in dust cases
the state police brought in...

632
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:23,639
...when I was night custody chief
at Oakville Mental.

633
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:27,679
Yeah, she's got the dries. She
always keeps licking her lips.

634
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:31,276
-She was dying for a fix.
-She has never taken drugs in her Life.

635
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:35,752
-Never!
-Well, it was just a wild guess.

636
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:44,796
They think she stole a ring at school.
I just can't believe it.

637
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:50,839
Is that all? I thought there was
some kind of major catastrophe.

638
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,833
She's been expelled, for God's sake.

639
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,798
I can think of a problem
that's more important...

640
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:59,190
...and you, as a parent,
are ignoring it.

641
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:00,952
What?

642
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:05,029
What is Elaine doing about sex?
Is she getting probed?

643
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:08,237
That was very foolish, Earl.
And it could get you snuffed!

644
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:17,793
Why do I keep getting sucked
into these degrading conversations?

645
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:22,910
Why should I assume that suddenly
you’ll turn into a human being?

646
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:25,429
Both you or Ramona.

647
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:21,552
Enid?

648
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:28,032
-Yes, Earl?
-Why is this door Locked?

649
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:38,438
Is that the dog?
Enid, is that goddamn dog in there?

650
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:42,798
It's all right.
He's housebroken. Almost.

651
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:48,192
What the hell is going on in there?

652
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:09,997
Enid?
Do you realise how this looks?

653
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:14,233
Should have slipped it through the mall
slot while you had the chance, Earl.

654
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:18,956
This is going to take explaining, Enid.
A helluva lot of explaining.

655
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:23,551
-Daddy, what's the matter?
-Nothing.

656
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:26,439
-I was talking to your mother.
-Through the door?

657
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:30,388
-It wasn't very important. Go to sleep.
-I just got up.

658
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:33,199
Okay, then do that, then.

659
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:47,797
How about this?
Beautiful morning, huh?

660
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:50,508
Somebody really did
a number on your front end here.

661
00:59:50,680 --> 00:59:54,195
Not to worry. I know a gypsy
in the city does cheap bodywork.

662
00:59:54,520 --> 00:59:57,990
Somebody wrote something here too.
Said " pimp wagon. "

663
00:59:58,160 --> 00:59:59,593
You know who wrote that.

664
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:01,910
Why would I Let
anybody write on your car?

665
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:04,640
I gotta use this buggy today,
to get us breakfast.

666
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:06,552
-Breakfast?
-Yeah.

667
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:10,599
-Just you and me?
-Yeah. Right. Who needs the women?

668
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:15,390
You know, personally, I think if it'd
just been us guys last night...

669
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:18,114
-... we wouldn’t have had any trouble.
-Really?

670
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:20,714
I know women,
upside down and backwards...

671
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:23,269
...which is not a bad way
to know them, huh?

672
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:26,989
I guess so. Say, what does
that say on your arm?

673
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:34,798
-" Born to party. "
-It's the way I live, babe. Have a cigar.

674
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:40,711
You ever seen one of these?

675
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,274
Wow.

676
01:00:45,120 --> 01:00:46,951
You know what you and I need?

677
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:49,794
-A boys' night out.
-Yeah.

678
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,753
-You fool around?
-Yeah, sure.

679
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:56,191
Good. Keep it under your hat.
I'm gonna get us breakfast.

680
01:00:56,360 --> 01:00:58,874
I hope you Like
blueberry pancakes and sausage.

681
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:00,996
-That's what you're getting.
-Sounds great.

682
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:03,037
Not the way I fix them.

683
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:37,031
Get your foot off the gas!

684
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:40,351
Well, watch the lever. Put your-!

685
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:43,159
Stop. Pull up, you jerk.
Back up.

686
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:44,639
What-?

687
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:49,794
Stop it. Watch where you're going.
Stop. Would you stop? You stupid shit!

688
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:52,110
I ought to crush
your head with a mallet.

689
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:56,233
The kid's an animal.
You got the keys?

690
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:59,073
It's not my truck.
The owner went to get breakfast.

691
01:01:59,320 --> 01:02:00,992
I hear you got a whore in there.

692
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:02,593
-Who told you that?
-I heard.

693
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:04,671
-Well you heard wrong.
-Ain't got a whore?

694
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:06,273
-No.
-Know where to find one?

695
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:09,432
-Of course not.
-If one shows up, you Let me know?

696
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:18,354
Careful. That mother freaking
snap back between...

697
01:02:18,520 --> 01:02:21,398
...your legs and lash your
whacker off something fierce.

698
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:29,752
Well.

699
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:34,910
It doesn't Look too bad, does it?
I don't think we'll have to tow it away.

700
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:37,957
Am I right?

701
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:42,279
You the bastard that mouthed off
to my dad last night?

702
01:02:42,920 --> 01:02:45,388
He smashed my car and
he punched me in the stomach.

703
01:02:45,560 --> 01:02:47,232
Oh, yeah?

704
01:02:48,280 --> 01:02:51,317
How would you Like your
nuts nailed to your forehead, huh?

705
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:54,995
Hey. Leave that wart-head alone.
Come on, we got cesspools to suck.

706
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:56,792
Okay, Dad.

707
01:02:58,280 --> 01:02:59,952
You're lucky.

708
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:05,314
I gotta go help my dad now.
But I'll be back.

709
01:03:31,120 --> 01:03:34,510
Hey, Vic. They got your truck.

710
01:03:35,120 --> 01:03:38,715
Looks as good as new.
Not a scratch on it.

711
01:03:38,920 --> 01:03:40,797
Well, where's breakfast?

712
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:42,998
Not a scratch?

713
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:50,189
The rear axle’s broken.

714
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:52,755
Well, I'll get it fixed. It's only fair.

715
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:57,471
-Forget it. Give it a decent burial.
-You don't want your truck?

716
01:03:57,640 --> 01:03:59,358
You don't get it, do you?

717
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:04,193
I'm moving. Away.

718
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:11,949
Moving? What do you mean, moving?
You haven't been here 24 hours yet.

719
01:04:12,120 --> 01:04:13,951
-What's wrong?
-I don't know. That swamp.

720
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:16,588
In the summer, it must be
a swing club for mosquitoes.

721
01:04:16,760 --> 01:04:18,432
The county sprays.
It's no problem.

722
01:04:18,600 --> 01:04:20,909
Those lines,
they're too close to the house.

723
01:04:21,080 --> 01:04:23,275
They cause hair loss,
Lumbar ecstimiosis...

724
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:25,237
...post cortical lesions and impotency.

725
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:26,674
It's just a myth.

726
01:04:26,840 --> 01:04:30,071
The power company wouldn’t
put them up if they were dangerous.

727
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:35,114
Of course, it's your right to move,
I guess.

728
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:38,317
But as far as I'm concerned,
I'd honestly Like you to stay.

729
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:39,913
You would?

730
01:04:40,120 --> 01:04:43,271
Well, to tell you the truth...

731
01:04:43,480 --> 01:04:45,869
...I haven't got
any friends around here.

732
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:50,953
I mean it.
As crazy as Last night was...

733
01:04:51,160 --> 01:04:53,958
<i>...even though I hated your guts
through most of it...</i>

734
01:04:54,120 --> 01:04:55,599
...I really had...

735
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:57,239
...a good time.

736
01:04:58,760 --> 01:05:00,113
Good time.

737
01:05:00,360 --> 01:05:05,070
I can't remember a better time
on any Friday night I've ever had.

738
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:06,633
Neither can I.

739
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:08,711
I bet Ramona doesn't wanna move,
does she?

740
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:11,633
She's not moving.
You can have her. She's all paid for.

741
01:05:12,680 --> 01:05:15,877
This is another joke.
Of course you're gonna take your wife.

742
01:05:16,040 --> 01:05:17,712
She might come in handy.

743
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:21,395
-Who says she's my wife?
-She's not your wife?

744
01:05:21,560 --> 01:05:23,710
-Whose wife is she?
-I couldn’t care less.

745
01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:26,440
If you want her, she's yours.
With my compliments.

746
01:05:26,600 --> 01:05:29,194
Well, I gotta pack.
It's been nice knowing you.

747
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:34,192
Enid. Open this door.

748
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:36,038
It's open.

749
01:05:40,080 --> 01:05:41,559
Where's Enid?

750
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:46,430
What the hell's going on in here?
Why was that door Locked before?

751
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:47,953
Where's my wife?

752
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:49,559
She's your wife.

753
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:52,433
Oh, yeah? Well, you know
what Vic just told me?

754
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:54,033
-What?
-He's moving.

755
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:56,077
Moving away.
And leaving you here.

756
01:05:56,240 --> 01:05:58,993
He said I could have you.
What do you think about that?

757
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:02,113
-Sounds exciting.
-I'm serious.

758
01:06:02,320 --> 01:06:04,436
So am I.

759
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:08,871
For God's sake,
Ramona, cover yourself.

760
01:06:09,040 --> 01:06:10,553
Come on.

761
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:14,396
-People just don't do this kind of thing.
-But we could.

762
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:17,992
Don't worry about Enid.

763
01:06:18,160 --> 01:06:22,358
She's not around.
We won't be disturbed.

764
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,514
Come on, before it gets cold.

765
01:06:26,680 --> 01:06:27,954
I can't.

766
01:06:28,120 --> 01:06:30,270
I know. You're worried about Vic.

767
01:06:30,760 --> 01:06:32,955
No, I'm not worried about Vic.

768
01:06:33,120 --> 01:06:35,236
-He's next door packing.
-All right, baby.

769
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:38,079
-Baby, watch it. All right, sweetheart.
-Oh, boy.

770
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:42,110
One time.
All right. All right, sweetie.

771
01:06:43,320 --> 01:06:46,676
Pull out, babe, pull out. All right.

772
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:50,077
All right. Looking good.

773
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:55,718
Pull out, babe, pull out. All right.

774
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:57,717
Jesus, what a case.

775
01:06:57,880 --> 01:06:59,950
Two minutes ago, he said
he was moving away.

776
01:07:00,120 --> 01:07:01,633
I think Vic was right about you.

777
01:07:02,240 --> 01:07:03,514
About what?

778
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:08,270
He said up is definitely not
your direction.

779
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:11,789
-Is that what he said?
-Yeah.

780
01:07:11,960 --> 01:07:14,520
Okay, we'll just see about that.

781
01:07:14,720 --> 01:07:17,314
That's my Little sweetheart. All right.

782
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:24,236
All right, dive, baby, dive.
Let's see a screaming dive. All right.

783
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:26,960
-Hi, neighbor.
-Hi.

784
01:07:27,120 --> 01:07:31,875
Now, I'm just gonna go under
the covers and take a Little inventory.

785
01:07:32,040 --> 01:07:36,830
-Promise you won't go away.
-I promise.

786
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:41,357
What beautiful performance. Beautiful.
Watch that mixture, watch that mixture.

787
01:07:41,560 --> 01:07:43,710
All right, all right.

788
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:48,230
All right, that's my sweetie.
Good, climb, baby, climb.

789
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:50,038
Come on, Earl.

790
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:52,839
I can't concentrate. It's Vic's plane.

791
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:57,437
That's it. Watch it.
Watch that mixture, take it easy.

792
01:08:01,240 --> 01:08:04,232
Good. He stopped.

793
01:08:09,360 --> 01:08:11,999
Earl. Earl, come quick!

794
01:08:13,600 --> 01:08:17,195
Where are you, are you
upstairs? Earl?

795
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:21,949
-Vic, what happened?
-We're losing the house, babe.

796
01:08:26,840 --> 01:08:28,432
Vic's house is on fire.

797
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:30,113
Did you call the fire department?

798
01:08:30,280 --> 01:08:33,750
My phone's dead.
Your phone's dead too.

799
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:38,955
Water, water.

800
01:08:39,160 --> 01:08:43,711
Look. Look, there's no fire.
It's a trick.

801
01:08:45,840 --> 01:08:47,114
Oh, it was terrible.

802
01:08:47,320 --> 01:08:49,436
I had her up to 100 feet.
Everything was great.

803
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:50,874
Then the controls jammed.

804
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,353
I think it was that tower.

805
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:56,637
-My signal couldn’t get to the servos.
-Poor baby.

806
01:08:56,840 --> 01:08:58,910
The motor cut out.
I knew it was in the soup.

807
01:08:59,080 --> 01:09:02,311
She went into a vertical spin,
hit the power lines, bounced up.

808
01:09:02,480 --> 01:09:04,630
And then she climbed 300 feet.

809
01:09:05,200 --> 01:09:08,431
You should’ve seen her.
She was magnificent.

810
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:11,956
She just sort of stopped
and hung there.

811
01:09:12,120 --> 01:09:14,714
Then she nosed over and came
straight down into my attic.

812
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:18,270
-The fuel pods exploded in seconds.
-Jesus.

813
01:09:18,520 --> 01:09:21,114
I stamped on the flames,
and everything spread so fast.

814
01:09:21,280 --> 01:09:22,872
That old house is Like a matchbox.

815
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:26,271
If you hadn't had the keys to the car,
he could have driven to a phone.

816
01:09:26,440 --> 01:09:29,876
-What about his truck?
-You broke his rear axle, Daddy.

817
01:09:37,320 --> 01:09:39,151
All right, here, then. It works.

818
01:09:39,320 --> 01:09:41,629
Go ahead. Call the fire department.

819
01:09:41,800 --> 01:09:44,598
You see, he won't even use
the phone.

820
01:09:44,760 --> 01:09:46,990
This is just another one of
his cheap tricks.

821
01:09:47,160 --> 01:09:50,038
Isn't that right, Vic?

822
01:09:50,200 --> 01:09:51,633
Look at him, Enid.

823
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:56,316
You're fawning all over a fake,
a phoney and a fraud.

824
01:10:03,960 --> 01:10:07,157
-Hey, brother, how about a beer?
-No, thank you.

825
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:10,279
Look at that thing go.

826
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:14,399
-What's wrong with the water?
-No pressure. Can't you see?

827
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:17,836
-Well, what can we do about it?
-I know what we can do.

828
01:10:18,040 --> 01:10:19,917
-What?
-Get some marshmallows.

829
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:37,677
Enid. Elaine.

830
01:10:38,680 --> 01:10:41,672
Relax. They're all gone.
They Left in your car.

831
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:43,598
Elaine had a key.

832
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:45,637
Vic made a trade.

833
01:10:45,800 --> 01:10:47,711
All of them for me.

834
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:54,232
It's been less than 24 hours since
you and Vic moved in next door.

835
01:10:56,680 --> 01:10:59,797
-It seems Like years.
-A Lot has happened.

836
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:03,111
You gonna miss Vic?

837
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:04,679
Vic?

838
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:07,158
I don't know.

839
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:09,875
He was fantastic in bed.

840
01:11:10,040 --> 01:11:11,758
Until I got in it.

841
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:16,319
You know, it's really great
that you can...

842
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:20,793
...admit things Like that
in your relationship.

843
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:24,231
You're really wonderful.

844
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:29,119
That's what I've been trying to tell you.

845
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:36,675
Is it so hard having your fantasies
come to Life?

846
01:11:38,920 --> 01:11:42,913
There's not a single living thing
Left on this road...

847
01:11:43,080 --> 01:11:45,310
<i>...except you and me.</i>

848
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:49,958
You know what we're gonna do now,
Earl, just you and me?

849
01:11:51,720 --> 01:11:53,073
What?

850
01:11:53,240 --> 01:11:56,312
Have breakfast. Are you hungry?

851
01:11:57,080 --> 01:12:00,993
I'm starving, but there's no food
in the house.

852
01:12:01,160 --> 01:12:03,071
Well, if you have ketchup
and hot water...

853
01:12:03,240 --> 01:12:04,912
...I could make you tomato soup.

854
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:06,839
Hey.

855
01:12:07,040 --> 01:12:10,237
I got a better idea. We'll go to the city.
We'll go anyplace you Like.

856
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:12,550
What kind of food?
French, Spanish, fish?

857
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:14,873
-I Like Greek.
-Greek. Great.

858
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:16,792
I know a great Greek restaurant.

859
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:19,110
-I'll go get a cab. I'll get ready-
-Oh, Earl?

860
01:12:19,480 --> 01:12:20,754
Yeah?

861
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:25,628
I know just who I want for dessert.

862
01:13:46,440 --> 01:13:48,032
Ramona.

863
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:50,711
Ramona?

864
01:13:56,600 --> 01:13:58,192
Ramona?

865
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:09,077
Ramona.

866
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:12,552
Surprise!

867
01:14:12,720 --> 01:14:14,233
See, buddy, I got you breakfast.

868
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:16,789
Hey, Daddy, Vic brought
my five favorite junk foods.

869
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:20,157
Elaine, get out the china. We'll inhale
this poison on the good stuff.

870
01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:23,915
-Where's all that plum sauce?
-It's in here, it's in here. Wait a second.

871
01:14:54,840 --> 01:14:57,115
Would you Like some wine, Enid?

872
01:15:01,880 --> 01:15:04,394
You know, I've been thinking, Enid.

873
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:07,510
For the past couple of years...

874
01:15:07,680 --> 01:15:09,989
...things around here have been...

875
01:15:10,680 --> 01:15:11,954
...stagnant.

876
01:15:12,120 --> 01:15:15,715
Not uncomfortable, mind you, but...

877
01:15:15,880 --> 01:15:18,348
...changeless. Tedious.

878
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:21,431
Except for Last night,
with Vic and Ramona.

879
01:15:21,720 --> 01:15:23,950
They're a sign. They're a revelation.

880
01:15:24,160 --> 01:15:27,550
They're squeezing the maximum yield
out of Life.

881
01:15:28,240 --> 01:15:30,470
Let's get back to the world
of the living.

882
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:33,916
Let's move back to the city.
Or move to the country.

883
01:15:34,080 --> 01:15:36,275
I mean, this is neither.

884
01:15:37,400 --> 01:15:39,118
What do you say?

885
01:15:39,560 --> 01:15:41,915
I understand your restlessness, Earl.

886
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:44,036
But true change comes only
from within.

887
01:15:44,200 --> 01:15:46,111
-Would you pass the wine?
-You feel it too?

888
01:15:46,280 --> 01:15:47,759
Not a bit.

889
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:50,480
But I do think the city would be
a good idea.

890
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:51,914
For you, in any case.

891
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:54,711
But I meant for both of us.

892
01:15:54,920 --> 01:15:56,672
If we had the money...

893
01:15:57,040 --> 01:15:59,270
...I think I'd go back to school.

894
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:01,158
I'd Like to...

895
01:16:01,320 --> 01:16:05,154
...intensify my Native American
art studies.

896
01:16:05,320 --> 01:16:07,595
We'll have the money.
We'll sell the house.

897
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:10,228
Vic, here, will buy it.
He's rolling in dough.

898
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:13,836
Why do you think he crashed his plane
into his house and burned it down?

899
01:16:14,040 --> 01:16:15,393
Why, Daddy?

900
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:17,909
For the insurance money. Right, Vic?

901
01:16:18,080 --> 01:16:20,514
How much you have the old place
insured for?

902
01:16:21,720 --> 01:16:23,756
He didn't have any insurance.

903
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:25,512
He never does.

904
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:27,239
Of course he had insurance.

905
01:16:27,400 --> 01:16:30,551
The bank wouldn’t give him a mortgage
without insurance.

906
01:16:32,440 --> 01:16:34,715
He didn't have a mortgage.

907
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:38,277
You paid cash?

908
01:16:39,040 --> 01:16:40,917
You rented?

909
01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:43,749
Do you remember
when your neighbor, Mrs. Warren...

910
01:16:43,960 --> 01:16:46,758
...moved to Riverside Nursing Home
after her husband died?

911
01:16:46,920 --> 01:16:49,195
Well, that's when we met her.

912
01:16:50,080 --> 01:16:51,798
Vic used to dress her all the time.

913
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:55,678
Mrs. Warren would always
ask for Vic.

914
01:16:56,880 --> 01:16:58,632
Well, when she died...

915
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:00,711
...the house was empty,
so we moved in.

916
01:17:02,440 --> 01:17:04,556
Vic said she wouldn’t mind.

917
01:17:06,120 --> 01:17:08,236
I said it was a steal.

918
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:12,676
This is really something.

919
01:17:13,120 --> 01:17:15,793
<i>You two ought to be on 60 Minutes.</i>

920
01:17:17,960 --> 01:17:20,952
Yeah, but now we don't have
no place to live.

921
01:17:22,640 --> 01:17:24,232
Daddy, they could live in my room.

922
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:26,755
Dick's invited me to Florida
for a couple of weeks.

923
01:17:26,920 --> 01:17:28,956
His mom won't be there.
She said it's okay.

924
01:17:29,120 --> 01:17:32,351
You stay out of this. You're not going
anywhere and Dick is off-limits.

925
01:17:32,680 --> 01:17:35,433
Maybe that's not a bad idea
that Elaine had.

926
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:37,511
I mean, they could stay
in the guest room.

927
01:17:37,680 --> 01:17:40,797
I don't know. That room's loaded
with a Lot of furniture and junk.

928
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:43,838
If we did stay, we'd really need
the big room, facing the road.

929
01:17:44,160 --> 01:17:45,832
The master bedroom?

930
01:17:46,040 --> 01:17:48,270
Hey, don't worry, we'd earn our keep
around here.

931
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:49,754
How wonderful.

932
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:51,672
-No heavy yard work, though.
-Hernia.

933
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:53,956
Well, I don't know, it is my bedroom.

934
01:17:54,120 --> 01:17:57,032
I kind of have a sentimental
attachment to it.

935
01:17:57,200 --> 01:17:58,474
I'll tell you what.

936
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:00,392
With a scrub-down
and some carpentry...

937
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:02,869
...we could make conditions liveable
in the garage.

938
01:18:03,040 --> 01:18:04,268
Garage, huh?

939
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:08,395
Right. That's it, then.
Ramona, let's hit the road.

940
01:18:08,600 --> 01:18:11,512
Please. Look, I was just kidding.

941
01:18:11,720 --> 01:18:14,632
I want you to stay. Both of you.
You're worth it.

942
01:18:15,120 --> 01:18:16,792
Please stay.

943
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:18,359
As my friends.

944
01:18:23,480 --> 01:18:24,708
Please.

945
01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:27,269
Stay here, in the outer limits
of the dead-end zone?

946
01:18:27,680 --> 01:18:30,240
Nothing personal, but Life
at the end of the road...

947
01:18:30,440 --> 01:18:33,750
...just ain't for Captain Vic
and Empress Ramona.

948
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:38,118
Sorry, folks, but you can
color us gone.

949
01:18:41,200 --> 01:18:44,272
Boy, they were neat.

950
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:47,390
They were beyond neat.

951
01:18:48,200 --> 01:18:50,350
They were extraordinary...

952
01:18:50,520 --> 01:18:52,272
<i>...unique...</i>

953
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:54,911
...special.

954
01:18:55,080 --> 01:18:56,752
Earl, can you write me a check?

955
01:18:56,920 --> 01:18:59,673
I'm gonna need some money
this week.

956
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:03,120
-How much?
-How much is in the account?

957
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:04,554
I don't know.

958
01:19:04,720 --> 01:19:06,631
Where's the checkbook?

959
01:19:08,120 --> 01:19:09,712
The checkbook!

960
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:13,230
-I'm hungry again. You wanna eat?
-Oh, yeah.

961
01:19:13,400 --> 01:19:17,279
Hold it. Hold it right there, folks.

962
01:19:20,320 --> 01:19:22,197
All right.

963
01:19:22,600 --> 01:19:24,192
Let me have it.

964
01:19:24,360 --> 01:19:26,157
What are you talking about
now, Earl?

965
01:19:26,320 --> 01:19:29,915
My checkbook. Not that there's
any money Left in my account.

966
01:19:30,080 --> 01:19:31,479
That's what you think of me?

967
01:19:31,640 --> 01:19:34,200
I take your hospitality,
I break bread with your family.

968
01:19:34,360 --> 01:19:35,793
You still think I'd rob you?

969
01:19:35,960 --> 01:19:37,552
Look, just give me the checkbook.

970
01:19:37,720 --> 01:19:41,599
I'm not even gonna talk about
the $32 you stole from me Last night...

971
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:43,671
...when you were
supposed to get dinner...

972
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:46,149
...and cooked that bogus
spaghetti meal instead.

973
01:19:46,320 --> 01:19:47,594
Your checkbook.

974
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:50,069
It's on the table in the hall,
next to your wallet.

975
01:19:50,240 --> 01:19:53,516
My wallet! Enid?
Look on the table in the hall.

976
01:19:53,720 --> 01:19:55,995
Do you see my wallet
and checkbook there?

977
01:19:56,840 --> 01:19:59,229
Elaine, get ready to call the police.

978
01:19:59,400 --> 01:20:01,231
Oh, Earl.

979
01:20:01,400 --> 01:20:03,356
Hey. Kojak.

980
01:20:03,560 --> 01:20:05,516
How much is Left in the account?

981
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:10,598
There's $310 Left in the account.

982
01:20:10,760 --> 01:20:14,548
Vic spent $17 on pants and a shirt
from Goodwill.

983
01:20:14,720 --> 01:20:19,271
And there's a receipt here for $32...

984
01:20:19,440 --> 01:20:21,351
...from Mr. Fong's Fast Chow.

985
01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:24,830
Do you want me to call
the National Guard now, Daddy?

986
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:26,558
-Elaine, get the car.
-What for?

987
01:20:26,720 --> 01:20:29,029
Just do as I ask.

988
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:30,918
Please.

989
01:20:31,080 --> 01:20:32,718
Give me the wallet.

990
01:20:33,880 --> 01:20:35,711
All right, now...

991
01:20:35,880 --> 01:20:38,394
...I don't want any argument
about this.

992
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:43,112
This is the Least I can do after all
the trouble I've put you two through.

993
01:20:43,280 --> 01:20:46,431
I just hope that someday
you can forgive me.

994
01:20:46,600 --> 01:20:48,238
-Here.
-What's that?

995
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:49,958
It's his vehicle registration.

996
01:20:50,120 --> 01:20:52,475
He just signed over his car to us.

997
01:20:52,640 --> 01:20:53,914
Really, Earl?

998
01:20:54,080 --> 01:20:56,389
Yes. It's all yours.

999
01:20:56,560 --> 01:20:59,950
I- I want you to have it...

1000
01:21:00,120 --> 01:21:02,680
<i>...because, well...</i>

1001
01:21:02,840 --> 01:21:04,956
Because I just want you to have it...

1002
01:21:05,120 --> 01:21:07,714
...and to get safely to wherever
you're going.

1003
01:21:07,880 --> 01:21:11,839
And, maybe, time and again, you might
think about your old neighbors...

1004
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:13,274
...here on Burt Street.

1005
01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:15,476
What's happening, Daddy?

1006
01:21:16,160 --> 01:21:19,232
Your old man just gave me
his car, honey.

1007
01:21:19,400 --> 01:21:22,312
-I don't know what to say.
-Oh, you don't have to say anything.

1008
01:21:22,480 --> 01:21:23,959
It doesn't seem enough.

1009
01:21:24,120 --> 01:21:25,678
Oh, Earl.

1010
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:29,389
You are the best.

1011
01:21:29,560 --> 01:21:32,870
Hey, come on. Take it easy,
super stud.

1012
01:21:33,040 --> 01:21:35,110
You make me Look bad.

1013
01:21:40,120 --> 01:21:43,715
So make sure you take care
of my Little Burt Street beauties.

1014
01:21:43,880 --> 01:21:45,916
-I'll try.
-All right.

1015
01:21:49,160 --> 01:21:50,718
Some time we had, huh?

1016
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:53,348
Don't drive too long.
You haven't had much sleep.

1017
01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:55,670
Remember those shots
I took at you Last night?

1018
01:21:55,880 --> 01:21:57,154
Yeah, I remember.

1019
01:21:57,360 --> 01:21:58,713
Come here.

1020
01:22:00,080 --> 01:22:03,117
I knew it was you.
That's why I missed.

1021
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:05,279
Thanks, Vic.

1022
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:08,113
Oh, I almost forgot.
Check the sticker on the door panel.

1023
01:22:08,280 --> 01:22:10,669
She'll need an oil change
in about 1000 miles.

1024
01:22:10,840 --> 01:22:13,593
Use Wolf’s Head Golden 30-weight.

1025
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:15,079
It'll never Let you down.

1026
01:22:15,440 --> 01:22:17,237
Thanks, buddy.

1027
01:22:20,520 --> 01:22:22,238
Okay, pal.

1028
01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:25,233
-Bye, folks.
-Goodbye.

1029
01:22:25,400 --> 01:22:27,834
Oh, we'll miss you.
I wish you weren't going.

1030
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,116
-Don't forget to write, huh?
-Bye.

1031
01:22:30,280 --> 01:22:32,430
Be cool, guys.

1032
01:22:50,200 --> 01:22:52,668

Hey, Dad, thanks.
It was far-out. Goodbye.

1036
01:23:02,960 --> 01:23:04,598
-Where you going?
-Back to school.

1037
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:07,636
Back to school?
I thought you got kicked out.

1038
01:23:07,840 --> 01:23:11,753
Connie Schiff confessed.
They threw her out and cleared me.

1039
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:15,629
Oh, that's my ride. I gotta go
or I'll miss the train. Bye, Dad.

1040
01:23:21,240 --> 01:23:23,959
-Elaine, I don't want you in that truck!
-I can't hear you.

1041
01:23:24,120 --> 01:23:28,352
I'll call you next week. Don't forget
to mall my allowance. Bye.

1042
01:23:28,520 --> 01:23:30,829
See you later, wart-head.

1043

Bye, Daddy.

Where are you going?

1045
01:23:49,760 --> 01:23:53,355
Oh, I have an emergency meeting of my
Native American art study circle.

1046
01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:56,512
-Where'd that getup come from?
-It was a present.

1047
01:23:56,680 --> 01:23:58,159
Oh, that must be Mr. Thundersky.

1048
01:23:58,320 --> 01:24:01,278
-Mr. Thundersky?
-My ride.

1049

-Who the hell is that?
-Don't wait up. Bye.

Ramona!

I see you still have
the same old wallpaper.

1067
01:25:47,800 --> 01:25:49,074
Hey.

1068
01:25:49,280 --> 01:25:51,236
You two make a sharp couple.

1069
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,434
You wouldn’t believe it.
It happened at the same time.

1070
01:25:54,600 --> 01:25:57,876
Vic stared at me. I stared at him.
We both knew it was wrong.

1071
01:25:58,040 --> 01:26:00,076
It's just not gonna be any fun
without you.

1072
01:26:00,240 --> 01:26:02,515
Honest? Does that mean you’ll stay?

1073
01:26:02,680 --> 01:26:05,069
-We've got plenty of room.
-No, no. We're past that.

You weren't kidding. You really are
Leaving a Little more than a note.
