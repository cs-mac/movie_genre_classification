1
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:03,893
I will always try my best
to be honest and fair,

2
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:06,694
to be helpful and friendly,

3
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:12,402
to be a good citizen,
a good neighbor, a good friend,

4
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:16,114
and a sister to every Wilderness Girl.

5
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:19,449
Girls, about face!

6
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:27,424
The first order of business
is the Beverly Hills troop.

7
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:30,711
Well, you know,
they've never earned any patches.

8
00:03:30,794 --> 00:03:32,888
They've never even sold a single cookie.

9
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:36,058
We all know they've had more leaders
than a banana republic.

10
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:40,138
Their membership is down to only eight.

11
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,563
So it's agreed then.

12
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:44,266
We stop mollycoddling
those little princesses,

13
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:47,023
and we flush that troop
down the old proverbial dumper.

14
00:03:47,102 --> 00:03:51,448
Now, Velda,
as long as they are girls who want to belong,

15
00:03:51,523 --> 00:03:55,073
it's our job to see
that they're not denied the privilege.

16
00:03:55,152 --> 00:03:57,621
Let's give them one last chance.

17
00:03:57,988 --> 00:04:02,243
Now, about a new leader,
I understand we have an applicant.

18
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:03,872
Herman. File, file.

19
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:05,454
Yes, sir... Ma'am.

20
00:04:10,876 --> 00:04:13,755
Name, Phyllis Nefler.

21
00:04:13,837 --> 00:04:15,510
Age...

22
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:18,684
Says here "not applicable."

23
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:20,386
Marital status,

24
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:22,975
"shaky?

25
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:26,979
<i>Interests, "community affairs."</i>

26
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:32,280
Dr. Jerry Honigman is definitely
boffing the blond and the English tutor.

27
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:34,107
Is that the one with the tummy tuck?

28
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:35,943
And the daughter.

29
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:37,198
No.

30
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:41,573
This one and this one.

31
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:44,660
Out. I'll take the rest.

32
00:04:44,743 --> 00:04:51,046
Prides herself on being honest,
resourceful, and thrifty.

33
00:04:52,876 --> 00:04:55,004
- How much?
-$5,600.

34
00:04:57,047 --> 00:04:59,049
You know, it's missing a bead.

35
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:00,884
It is?

36
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:09,651
I can let you have it for $5,000.

37
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:12,562
- I'll take it.
- Great.

38
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,815
She loves animals.

39
00:05:16,525 --> 00:05:18,493
I'm gonna kiss you.

40
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:22,072
I'm gonna kiss you, froggy,
and turn you into a handsome prince.

41
00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:27,503
This woman sounds like
she's got Wilderness Girl written all over her.

42
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:28,954
Approved.

43
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:09,995
Hi ho!

44
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:11,330
Ohio!

45
00:06:12,247 --> 00:06:14,750
Hey, your hat is fabulous Mrs. Nefler.

46
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:18,337
- Thank you. So is yours.
- Hey, thanks.

47
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:23,263
Rosa! Rosa!

48
00:06:24,426 --> 00:06:26,975
Keep talking, honey, so I can move
toward the sound of your voice.

49
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:29,602
Here I am. Yeah, come... Keep... I'm here.

50
00:06:29,681 --> 00:06:31,729
Come. Come. I got it. I got it.

51
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:34,402
I started my new meaningful life today,

52
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:37,151
and I bought a whole new
meaningful wardrobe to go with it.

53
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:40,154
I can hardly wait to see the look
on Freddy's face when he gets the bill.

54
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:41,655
And you know the beauty of it?

55
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:45,285
He won't even the get the bill
until after we're divorced.

56
00:06:46,448 --> 00:06:47,825
Have your fun now, Phyllis,

57
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:52,455
'cause after the divorce is final,
you're going to be shopping at Pick 'n Save.

58
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:55,757
What are you doing here?

59
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:58,005
Before we were separated,
you were never around.

60
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,383
You're supposed to be in the guesthouse.

61
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:03,090
Everything north of the lawn jockey is mine.

62
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:04,425
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

63
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:07,135
Come on. I can come here anytime I want to.

64
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:08,936
Yeah. It's still my house, you know.

65
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:10,980
And right now, I am gonna go upstairs,

66
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:14,731
I'm gonna get my barbell,
and I'm gonna get the rest of my clothes.

67
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:19,189
Touch anything in this house,
and I'll call my lawyer.

68
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:21,445
I can touch anything I want.

69
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:24,827
I paid for it all.

70
00:07:24,903 --> 00:07:28,123
Now isn't that a mature approach
to a relationship?

71
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:31,202
Freddy, did it ever occur to you
that marriage is a partnership?

72
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:32,376
- Yeah, that's right.
- Yeah.

73
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,625
I earn the money,
and my partner, she spends it.

74
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:37,048
Typical, that is so typical.

75
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:39,421
And don't you mock me
while I'm talking to you!

76
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:42,425
You never acknowledge
my contribution to this marriage.

77
00:07:42,504 --> 00:07:44,006
- Your contribution?
- Yes!

78
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:48,720
Phyllis, if you contributed any more
to this marriage, we would be on welfare!

79
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:52,811
Hello, Hannah.
You remember your father, the Big Bad Wolf?

80
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:54,732
- Hi, Peaches.
- Hi, Daddy.

81
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:56,560
What are you picking up this time?

82
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:58,645
- My dumbbells.
- Be my guest.

83
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:01,026
The fewer dumbbells in my life, the better.

84
00:08:01,106 --> 00:08:04,861
I've got a great idea.
Why don't you two just kiss and make up?

85
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:07,822
Then I won't end up in therapy twice a week
like Tessa.

86
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:09,907
Honey, you're gonna be less neurotic

87
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:13,585
if your parents are happily divorced
rather than unhappily married.

88
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:16,789
- Thank you, Phil Donahue.
- I saw it on Oprah.

89
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:20,125
Cool it. You're acting so immature.

90
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:25,423
Mom, a lady called
about an orientation meeting.

91
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,007
It's Thursday.

92
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:30,518
You are gonna go through with this,
aren't you?

93
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:31,890
Of course, I am.

94
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:33,768
Go through with what?

95
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:38,064
Just a little mother-daughter bonding thing.

96
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:41,564
Mom's going to be our new troop leader.

97
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:45,866
What's so funny?

98
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:47,785
Well, I mean, it's hysterical.

99
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:50,990
You don't have any skills.
You hate the outdoors.

100
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:54,326
Besides, you never finished anything
you ever started.

101
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:56,878
- What about the PTA?
- You quit!

102
00:08:56,953 --> 00:09:00,753
Well, that was just because
it conflicted with Save the Whales.

103
00:09:00,832 --> 00:09:02,049
Then what happened?

104
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:06,050
Well, I thought
Hands Across America was more important.

105
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:08,598
Well, I rest my case!

106
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:12,223
You'll be lucky if you last a couple of weeks.

107
00:09:12,302 --> 00:09:14,896
I'm going to be a great Troop Leader.

108
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:16,393
And I'll be spending more time with Hannah.

109
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:19,022
What? And neglect Rodeo Drive?

110
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:22,938
Don't criticize my mothering, Mr. Workaholic.

111
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:25,657
You're hardly father of the year.

112
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:31,742
Rosa, will you stop crying?

113
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:34,199
Who's getting the divorce here, you or me?

114
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:37,206
I don't want you two to split up.

115
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:43,334
See, there, I told you
not to mention divorce in front of Rosa.

116
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,339
She's helping me pack!

117
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:49,844
What's happened to us, Fred?

118
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:55,182
What's this really about?

119
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:00,350
Is there another woman?

120
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:05,863
Well, yeah, there is.

121
00:10:06,648 --> 00:10:09,322
A girl I met a long, long time ago.

122
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,705
Bright, caring, loving, funny.

123
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:16,707
It was you.

124
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:22,960
You had such potential, such energy.
You were so creative.

125
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:25,838
I couldn't wait to see what you'd do with it.

126
00:10:25,917 --> 00:10:28,716
See, now, I know what you did with it.

127
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:29,887
You went shopping!

128
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:36,724
Hey, I went shopping, buster,
to furnish your perfect house,

129
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:42,477
to build your perfect image,
to be your perfect, Beverly Hills wife!

130
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:46,029
And you think I've changed?
How about you, Fred?

131
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:49,278
I coupon-clipped your way
through law school,

132
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:51,735
so you could make a difference in the world,

133
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:54,697
not so you could be Nefler the Muffler Man!

134
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:57,248
Hey, those commercials were your idea.

135
00:10:57,323 --> 00:11:01,624
And I didn't hear you complaining when
you were spending the Muffler Man's money.

136
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:07,551
I mean, I know it's not a really important job,
you know, like being a Wilderness Girl.

137
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:12,676
I don't expect you to understand
how much this means to me, or to Hannah,

138
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:15,850
or her little friends, who happen to need me.

139
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:19,683
Even if you don't.

140
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:22,311
You never give me an ounce of credit
for anything I do.

141
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,688
That's because you never do anything!

142
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:29,281
Well, then, I guess
I'm going to do something right now.

143
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:32,150
I'll help you pack.

144
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:49,254
Marlene, I'm on my way to the hospital now.

145
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:51,587
I'm stopping to drop Tiffany off
at her troop meeting.

146
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:56,891
I have a nose job at 3:00,
a lift at 5:00, and a boob job at 7:00,

147
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:58,718
so you won't be able to reach me.

148
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:01,395
Daddy, do I have to go to this thing?

149
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:03,394
- Tiff, you'll love it.
<i>- I'll</i> hate it.

150
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:05,316
What'd you... Hold on a second, sweetie.

151
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:07,485
- I said I'd give you 10 bucks.
-It's not worth it.

152
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,652
-$20.
- No way.

153
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:09,729
-$30.
-$50.

154
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:12,110
$40, and that's my final offer.

155
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:15,531
I'll suffer through it.

156
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:19,368
What do you think?

157
00:12:21,616 --> 00:12:23,584
It looks great.

158
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,879
Is the caviar too much?

159
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:32,418
Here comes Chica.

160
00:12:32,502 --> 00:12:36,223
Chica Barnfell, our first arrival!

161
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:38,929
Chica! Hi!

162
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:40,851
Do you remember me? Phyllis Nefler.

163
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:45,353
We met at your parents' home
in Palms Springs when Fergie was in town?

164
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:47,433
What a lovely child.

165
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:55,943
Dad, why are we stopping here?
The park is a block up.

166
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:59,871
I'm late for an appointment, honey.
That's the actor's life, busy, busy.

167
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,032
You're going to unemployment, right?

168
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:05,581
Right. Anyway, you have a good time, okay?

169
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:10,882
Dad, I'm supposed to bring $10 for dues.

170
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:14,837
Emily, I forgot my wallet.
Tell 'em you'll bring it next time.

171
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:17,259
Okay.

172
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:18,635
I'll get something soon.

173
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:22,390
My agent says this nostalgia boom
is going to make me a big star again.

174
00:13:23,094 --> 00:13:25,222
You'll always be a star to me, Daddy.

175
00:13:27,098 --> 00:13:30,068
- I love you.
- I love you. Bye.

176
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:47,248
Good morning. You must be Lily.

177
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:50,671
Good morning, Dictator. Mrs. Dictator.

178
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:53,500
- Good morning.
- Lovely to see you.

179
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:57,258
Bruce, I looked at the dailies.

180
00:13:57,337 --> 00:14:00,181
I want to reshoot the ending.
Set it up for today.

181
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:03,100
Today? 5,000 extras?

182
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:05,599
Redford? Fifteen helicopters?

183
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:09,224
- Dad, you can't do it.
- Why not, Tessa?

184
00:14:09,307 --> 00:14:13,653
You're $10 million over budget.
Redford's on another project,

185
00:14:13,728 --> 00:14:16,447
and you blew up
all the helicopters yesterday.

186
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:17,648
I did?

187
00:14:17,732 --> 00:14:22,784
Daddy, my therapist would say
you're definitely blocking reality.

188
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:29,290
What was it again, $30?

189
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:31,121
-$40.
-$40.

190
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:43,053
May I see your license
and registration, please?

191
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:44,304
What's the problem, Officer?

192
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:46,557
You know
how fast you were going back there?

193
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:51,312
Excuse me, Officer,
don't you know who this man is?

194
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,143
- Jasmine, honey.
- Jasmine, cool it.

195
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:54,899
You're too modest, Daddy.

196
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:59,858
Look, this here's the man
who put the space in Spinks' teeth,

197
00:14:59,941 --> 00:15:02,660
the man who
knocked the hair off Hagler's head.

198
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:04,783
He's the best. He's the greatest.

199
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:08,583
He's my dad,
James "The Jackhammer" Shaker.

200
00:15:08,658 --> 00:15:14,165
Now, Daddy, shake the man's hand,
and let's be on our way.

201
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:18,672
How do you do, sir? Glad to meet you.

202
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:20,753
Could I get your autograph?

203
00:15:20,837 --> 00:15:22,305
Not on that thing, you won't.

204
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:35,477
He pulled off her Halston gown,

205
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:41,613
sighed lusciously at the sight of
her Fernando Sénchez underthings, and...

206
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:44,785
And what?

207
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:49,082
And felt his manhood rising to a frenzy.

208
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:57,462
Felt his manhood
rising to a pulsating frenzy.

209
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,383
Yeah, that's good. I love it.

210
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:02,133
Now, darling,
what am I gonna tell your producer

211
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:05,010
about you skipping rehearsals today?

212
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:06,591
- Tell him I'm sick.
- Claire.

213
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:11,646
Come on, Mom. I'm not just a kid on TV.
I'm one in real life.

214
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:14,474
I want to do something normal
for a change, okay?

215
00:16:14,557 --> 00:16:17,356
Normal with Phyllis running the show?

216
00:16:17,435 --> 00:16:19,529
That's highly bloody unlikely.

217
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:24,821
Welcome. I'm Phyllis Nefler,
mother of the lovely Hannah.

218
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:26,198
Mother!

219
00:16:26,277 --> 00:16:29,156
And, <i>as</i> you know, your new leader.

220
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:32,162
Now I know
that we're gonna have a fabulous time

221
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:37,338
because I can see that you're all special,
unique, fabulous little people

222
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:38,505
just raring to go.

223
00:16:38,581 --> 00:16:42,961
She'll be just like all the others.
She'll get bored with us, and she'll quit.

224
00:16:43,044 --> 00:16:47,345
I'm new at this, but
aren't you supposed to be wearing uniforms?

225
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:49,846
Sick, uniforms are sick.

226
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:52,770
They blur an individual's sense of self.

227
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:56,941
Besides, no one ever stayed around
long enough to take us to the store.

228
00:16:57,016 --> 00:17:02,147
Well, I may be a beginner at some things,
but I've got a black belt in shopping.

229
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:07,485
Do they only come in khaki?

230
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:10,162
Yes. Now what sizes do you need?

231
00:17:10,238 --> 00:17:13,082
- Well, I need a French 36.
-If you want that French stuff,

232
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:14,830
you're gonna have to go
to Frederick's of Hollywood.

233
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:18,253
Are you sure you're Wilderness Girls?

234
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:21,295
I'm not selling this shit
for no masquerade parties.

235
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:29,761
How's it look?

236
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,057
I like it.

237
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:33,886
-It's great.
-It's okay.

238
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:37,645
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

239
00:17:38,516 --> 00:17:41,190
-It's not that bad.
- Not that bad?

240
00:17:41,269 --> 00:17:44,318
Except for the color's wrong,
the collar's wrong,

241
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:46,946
the material's a nightmare from hell.

242
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:50,494
It's cut badly, it itches, and it's not me.

243
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:53,910
But all of that can be fixed.

244
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:54,036
Henri? Henri.

245
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:56,625
Henri? Henri.

246
00:17:57,994 --> 00:18:01,089
My god, darling, what is that?

247
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:05,259
I know. It's my Wilderness Girl uniform.
What can you do with it?

248
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:07,177
You mean, besides burn it?

249
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:15,598
My name is Velda Plendor.

250
00:18:15,678 --> 00:18:20,809
I'm a mother. I'm a widow.
I'm an ex-Army nurse.

251
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:24,609
First and foremost, I am a Wilderness Girl,

252
00:18:25,688 --> 00:18:31,946
and I have the privilege
of turning you civilians into troop leaders.

253
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:38,577
Now it's not easy.
It's not going to be a picnic.

254
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:40,377
Not all of you are going to make it.

255
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:44,298
So if any of you
little Betty Crockers out there

256
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:47,468
think that you're just going to be teaching
some little toddlers

257
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:48,965
how to bake cuppie cakes,

258
00:18:49,045 --> 00:18:50,922
then you can leave now.

259
00:18:55,009 --> 00:18:58,058
Perfect. Good. Good. Let 'em go.

260
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:04,903
Because when we're looking for new leaders,
we're looking for a real no-nonsense woman.

261
00:19:08,022 --> 00:19:09,023
Hi.

262
00:19:10,191 --> 00:19:11,408
Bye.

263
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:14,237
A woman who can cope with anything.

264
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:18,742
A woman who doesn't make a ruckus...

265
00:19:19,742 --> 00:19:22,336
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

266
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:26,504
But still can get the job done.

267
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:27,959
I'm so sorry.

268
00:19:33,464 --> 00:19:35,262
Our goal is simple,

269
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:38,686
to take young, vulnerable girls

270
00:19:38,761 --> 00:19:42,436
and turn them into strong,
self-sufficient, young women.

271
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:45,105
And to attain that goal,

272
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:50,027
the girls must earn achievement patches,
sell cookies,

273
00:19:50,106 --> 00:19:55,237
and attend the annual Jamboree,
which is a grueling test.

274
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:58,789
Are you drying your nails,
or do you have a question?

275
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:02,376
- No, they're fine.
- Yes?

276
00:20:02,952 --> 00:20:04,829
You know, about the cookies,

277
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:08,712
I know it's customary in order
to raise funds to sell cookies door-to-door,

278
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:09,917
and that's adorable.

279
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,220
But wouldn't it save time
and a little shoe leather,

280
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:17,300
if we just had a star-studded telethon?

281
00:20:18,676 --> 00:20:21,054
- Who are you?
- Johnny could host or Merv.

282
00:20:21,137 --> 00:20:22,354
It'd be fabulous.

283
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:23,647
Who are you?

284
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:27,064
Phyllis Nefler, Troop Beverly Hills.

285
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,609
Shit. I should have known.

286
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:35,280
<i>Do you know the Muffler Man
the Muffler Man, the Muffler Man?</i>

287
00:20:35,985 --> 00:20:39,330
<i>Do you know the Muffler Man?
Nefler is his name</i>

288
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:43,080
<i>Hi, Fred Nefler here for Neflefs Mufflers.</i>

289
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:45,537
<i>Boy, I'm telling you,
We're a hard working crew,</i>

290
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:48,255
<i>and look at the sick little baby
we got in here today.</i>

291
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:50,833
<i>Now if your Pinto, Porsche,
or whatever is sick,</i>

292
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:54,295
<i>we don't discriminate here.
We'll fix anything. We'll fix it right.</i>

293
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:56,927
<i>- I'm telling you...
- He's</i> a <i>shit,</i>

294
00:20:57,006 --> 00:20:58,883
but he's a cute shit.

295
00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:40,304
Hannah, wake up. Wake up, honey.

296
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:42,305
There's a woman going into the guesthouse.

297
00:21:42,885 --> 00:21:44,887
Dark hair, long legs, big boobs?

298
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:49,268
Stringy hair, skinny legs, silicone boobs,
but yes.

299
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:52,650
Don't worry, Mom.
It's just Lisa, Dad's realtor.

300
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:54,401
She's trying to find him a condo.

301
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,155
At midnight? It must be a real hot listing.

302
00:21:59,193 --> 00:22:02,037
Mom, can we spy on dad in the morning?

303
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:05,833
Spy? Excuse me, spy?

304
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:12,332
Your father's nocturnal activities
are of absolutely no interest to me.

305
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:33,398
Shit.

306
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:39,574
Night, Phyllis.

307
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:42,365
"Night, Phyllis."

308
00:22:42,945 --> 00:22:45,118
- She's okay.
- That's good. Bye.

309
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:46,289
Bye.

310
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:56,588
- Here.
- Good.

311
00:22:57,835 --> 00:22:59,553
Watch the arms.

312
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:06,139
- Mom?
- Yeah.

313
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:10,519
I think we'll be back before winter.
It's only an overnight campout.

314
00:23:10,598 --> 00:23:14,228
In the wilderness of life,
we can never be too prepared.

315
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:20,733
Well, girls, are you ready to rough it?

316
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:51,309
What are we supposed to do now?

317
00:23:51,388 --> 00:23:53,982
Well, we were supposed
to set up the tents and stuff.

318
00:23:54,058 --> 00:23:56,607
Yeah, but the Abbey Rents person
already did that.

319
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:59,564
This is so boring. Someone should go
ask her what we're supposed to do.

320
00:23:59,647 --> 00:24:01,524
Well, let's all go.

321
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:06,946
Having fun?

322
00:24:08,072 --> 00:24:10,040
Mrs. Nefler.

323
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:12,959
We're above the fire line,
and you shouldn't be smoking.

324
00:24:13,035 --> 00:24:14,287
It's bad for you.

325
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:18,841
And it disguises nervous conditions
which you should deal with in other ways.

326
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:21,886
Smokey the Bear says
only you can prevent forest fires.

327
00:24:21,961 --> 00:24:25,431
Smokey the Bear isn't going through
a terribly messy divorce.

328
00:24:27,216 --> 00:24:31,596
And voila', fondue alfresco.

329
00:24:35,224 --> 00:24:38,899
And next, we're going to make espresso.

330
00:24:39,395 --> 00:24:40,772
No!

331
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:42,356
Fabulous.

332
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:44,988
All right, all right, go in the tent.
Go in the tent.

333
00:24:45,067 --> 00:24:46,910
I'll save the dessert.

334
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:49,905
This is special.

335
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:54,460
I'm coming, girls! I've got the fondue!

336
00:25:10,676 --> 00:25:12,519
All right, all right.

337
00:25:23,105 --> 00:25:24,607
Gosh.

338
00:25:29,403 --> 00:25:31,497
- Look at your jacket.
- No.

339
00:25:32,865 --> 00:25:34,492
Can we just quit now?

340
00:25:35,701 --> 00:25:37,954
<i>Not until we sing Kumbaya.</i>

341
00:25:40,998 --> 00:25:43,751
<i>Kumbaya, my Lord</i>

342
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:47,054
<i>Kumbaya</i>

343
00:25:48,297 --> 00:25:50,971
<i>Kumbaya, my Lord</i>

344
00:25:52,009 --> 00:25:53,852
<i>Kumbaya</i>

345
00:25:55,012 --> 00:25:58,232
<i>Kumbaya, my Lord</i>

346
00:25:58,307 --> 00:26:01,481
<i>Kumbaya</i>

347
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:04,029
<i>Oh, Lord, kumbaya</i>

348
00:26:04,146 --> 00:26:06,524
<i>May I speak with Velda Plendor, please?</i>

349
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:10,072
Well, will you take a message, please?

350
00:26:10,152 --> 00:26:12,746
Will you tell her
that Troop Leader Nefler called?

351
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:16,792
And her recommendation
for a campsite was totally unsuitable.

352
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:21,414
There were no outlets,
and there was dirt and bugs,

353
00:26:21,497 --> 00:26:23,591
and it rains there.

354
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:26,885
So anyway, we found a place
that's much more us.

355
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,258
And if any of the other parents call,

356
00:26:29,338 --> 00:26:32,683
you'll tell them
that we're at the Beverly Hills Hotel?

357
00:26:32,758 --> 00:26:34,305
Thank you.

358
00:26:36,762 --> 00:26:38,935
How about some room service?

359
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:40,857
That sounds good.

360
00:26:41,475 --> 00:26:45,821
Yes, hello, I'd like to place an order, please.
Nefler, bungalow four.

361
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:54,281
Then it sounded like it was in the foyer.

362
00:26:55,364 --> 00:27:02,122
"Who's got my golden arm?"

363
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:07,005
Then it sounded
like it was in the maid's room.

364
00:27:08,669 --> 00:27:14,347
"Who's got my golden arm?"

365
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:20,514
My gosh.

366
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:26,482
Come on, Mrs. Nefler. It's your turn.

367
00:27:26,562 --> 00:27:29,236
- A scary story?
- Yeah, come on.

368
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,902
- Okay.
- All right.

369
00:27:40,576 --> 00:27:44,581
It was a cold and rainy day in March.

370
00:27:45,956 --> 00:27:48,835
I went to Christophe's
where I usually get my hair done,

371
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:53,593
but Christophe
had mysteriously disappeared.

372
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:57,350
And in his place

373
00:27:57,426 --> 00:28:01,727
<i>was a stranger named Rename.</i>

374
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:06,272
I'll never forget him.

375
00:28:07,436 --> 00:28:12,067
His eyes were steely gray, very cold.

376
00:28:12,149 --> 00:28:15,699
And his hands were like ice.

377
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:22,080
He said, "I'll streak your hair,

378
00:28:24,036 --> 00:28:26,130
"and I'll give you a body wave."

379
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:29,875
He worked very fast,

380
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:34,930
and then as he turned my chair around
to face the mirror,

381
00:28:35,881 --> 00:28:36,882
I saw it.

382
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,893
He permed me!

383
00:29:30,352 --> 00:29:34,448
<i>Hey, look, it's my giant underpants!</i>

384
00:29:35,524 --> 00:29:39,825
<i>You know, you can do a lot of cool stuff
with a pair of giant underpants. Just watch!</i>

385
00:29:43,365 --> 00:29:46,414
Hey, Hannah, look at me. I'm your mother.

386
00:29:47,411 --> 00:29:49,334
Follow me, girls.

387
00:29:49,413 --> 00:29:53,088
This is fabulous, just fabulous.

388
00:29:58,755 --> 00:30:01,804
<i>Chalk on the sidewalk
Writing on the wall</i>

389
00:30:01,883 --> 00:30:04,432
<i>Everybody knows it
I love Paul</i>

390
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:06,479
Annette, wait up, huh?

391
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:10,730
This is that bimbo's idea of a campsite?

392
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:13,312
I'll raise you two marshmallows.

393
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:20,237
I'll see your two marshmallows
and raise you a wiener.

394
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:22,617
You're bluffing.

395
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:26,662
Wilderness Girls don't bluff.

396
00:30:27,576 --> 00:30:29,374
<i>Look! I'm a nun!</i>

397
00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:34,212
- Hi. Good morning.
- Hello.

398
00:30:35,334 --> 00:30:36,586
No.

399
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,088
You are out of here.

400
00:30:45,052 --> 00:30:46,099
Where is your leader?

401
00:30:47,763 --> 00:30:50,391
You can torture me if you want,
but I'll never talk.

402
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:54,273
She's in the bedroom. Is she expecting you?

403
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:58,987
Girls, did the room service arrive yet?

404
00:31:00,942 --> 00:31:03,536
Mon capitaine, what a pleasant surprise.

405
00:31:03,612 --> 00:31:05,580
Won't you join us
for a little cappuccino and croissant?

406
00:31:05,655 --> 00:31:08,329
Nefler, what the hell is happening here?

407
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:11,628
This is supposed to be a camp out,
not a pajama party.

408
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:13,046
This what you call roughing it?

409
00:31:13,497 --> 00:31:16,046
One bathroom for nine people? Yes.

410
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:20,171
Maybe you never heard of
a little troop called the Red Feathers?

411
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:23,507
They were out there
at that same site camping last week.

412
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:26,309
They chopped down trees,
and wove their own cloth,

413
00:31:26,385 --> 00:31:28,513
and lived off of berries and squirrel meat.

414
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:31,974
And never once
did they have to go to the bathroom.

415
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:34,980
It must have been the squirrel meat.

416
00:31:38,647 --> 00:31:40,194
- Nefler...
- Cappuccino?

417
00:31:40,273 --> 00:31:43,823
You have disrupted my meetings
with your stupid, idiotic questions.

418
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:48,954
You have taken the sacred uniform
and turned into a little cocktail frock.

419
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:51,706
And you tore these children
from a wholesome camping environment,

420
00:31:51,785 --> 00:31:54,459
and you brought 'em here
to this little den of inequity.

421
00:31:54,538 --> 00:31:55,664
Just what are you trying to do, huh?

422
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:59,634
Okay, so I'm not perfect.

423
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:02,758
Granted, I'm new at this,

424
00:32:02,838 --> 00:32:06,217
and between us girls,
I haven't worked all the kinks out.

425
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:11,021
So any tips for the new girl
would be greatly appreciated.

426
00:32:11,096 --> 00:32:13,098
- Well, here's a tip.
- Okay.

427
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:14,182
Give it up.

428
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:17,360
You can prance these princesses
through Beverly Hills all you want,

429
00:32:17,436 --> 00:32:21,111
but you will never really be
a real Wilderness Girl.

430
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:23,112
This troop
should have been disbanded long ago.

431
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:26,741
I know it, they know it, and you know it.

432
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:28,948
<i>Adiés,</i> Nefler. Have a nice day.

433
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:30,247
Herman!

434
00:32:38,707 --> 00:32:41,301
Guess it's back to the shrink on Tuesdays.

435
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:43,378
So much for being normal.

436
00:32:43,462 --> 00:32:45,715
I knew it wouldn't last.

437
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:47,970
Well, I don't know about you girls,

438
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:51,599
but next Tuesday,
I'm going to be at the troop meeting.

439
00:32:59,019 --> 00:33:02,239
Did you see the way I handled that, Herman?
You're never going to see that woman again.

440
00:33:02,314 --> 00:33:04,658
I'm sure we won't, Ms. Plendor, sir.

441
00:33:04,733 --> 00:33:07,862
She thinks just because she's rich
she doesn't have to play by the rules.

442
00:33:11,615 --> 00:33:14,664
I can't believe
he's taking her to the Dodger game.

443
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:19,001
It's batting helmet day,
and she's not even under 14.

444
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,753
Don't bet on it.

445
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:24,090
I guess he's divorcing both of us.

446
00:33:25,921 --> 00:33:27,264
I know you feel bad, honey,

447
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:30,969
but try to remember
that Dad's going through a phase right now.

448
00:33:31,051 --> 00:33:33,930
It's called being a big jerk.

449
00:33:41,061 --> 00:33:44,361
This is very interesting.

450
00:33:45,941 --> 00:33:47,443
What does that represent?

451
00:33:48,902 --> 00:33:51,530
It's the source of power
that allows a brave to defend his home

452
00:33:51,613 --> 00:33:54,457
and destroy his enemies, right, Mom?

453
00:33:55,242 --> 00:33:57,370
Nix on the "Mom" business.

454
00:33:57,452 --> 00:34:00,205
Sorry, Ms. Plendor, sir.

455
00:34:02,415 --> 00:34:07,637
Look at those adorable little red feathers,
and your patches, those are fabulous.

456
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:11,842
- They really bring your uniforms to life.
- Thank you, ma'am.

457
00:34:11,925 --> 00:34:17,022
- Where can I buy those?
- You don't buy them. You have to earn them.

458
00:34:17,097 --> 00:34:19,441
Right, like jewelry.

459
00:34:21,142 --> 00:34:23,395
- Damn.
- What's wrong?

460
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:25,526
I was sure she'd quit.

461
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:31,161
Here's Claire, who you might recognize
from television,

462
00:34:31,236 --> 00:34:32,909
and she's wearing a backpack.

463
00:34:32,988 --> 00:34:37,539
Of course, it may look
like an ordinary, high-quality backpack, but...

464
00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:42,373
When we lift the flap and pop the snap...

465
00:34:46,001 --> 00:34:49,631
Just because you're out in the woods,
it's no excuse not to look your best.

466
00:34:49,713 --> 00:34:53,343
- You call that a wilderness craft?
- Where are you guys from, Mars?

467
00:34:53,425 --> 00:34:55,177
Worse. Beverly Hills.

468
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:11,610
I want that woman out, Herman.
She's a threat to everything we stand for.

469
00:35:12,694 --> 00:35:15,447
I'm gonna assign you
as Assistant Troop Leader.

470
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:18,659
You can infiltrate her organization,
win her trust.

471
00:35:19,492 --> 00:35:21,586
And then you can get the goods on her.

472
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:25,006
We are going to form
a dossier of information on her.

473
00:35:25,332 --> 00:35:27,130
I know you know best,

474
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:30,883
but does that jive with the ideals
of the Wilderness Girl Promise?

475
00:35:31,755 --> 00:35:33,974
Promise? I'll give you a promise, Herman.

476
00:35:34,049 --> 00:35:38,930
I promise you'll be back at Kmart selling
those yarn balls if you don't follow orders.

477
00:35:39,012 --> 00:35:40,685
No.

478
00:35:40,764 --> 00:35:44,439
Hello, Mrs. Nefler.
This is Annie Herman. Remember me?

479
00:35:44,517 --> 00:35:47,737
Of course I remember you, Annie.

480
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:51,567
You're the gal Friday
to our fearless leader, n'est-ce <i>pas?</i>

481
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:54,494
Yes. Ms. Plendor was...

482
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:59,496
I was wondering if I could offer my services
to you <i>as</i> an assistant troop leader.

483
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:01,872
You know, I really could use some help.

484
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:05,626
The parents in this neighborhood
are so self-involved.

485
00:36:05,705 --> 00:36:08,754
Shit, I broke a nail.

486
00:36:09,626 --> 00:36:12,379
Okay, okay, we'll see you tomorrow.

487
00:36:14,089 --> 00:36:15,432
She bought it.

488
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:55,259
Testing.

489
00:36:55,338 --> 00:36:58,558
<i>Ready, lift. And down.</i>

490
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:01,352
<i>Exhale, inhale down.</i>

491
00:37:03,596 --> 00:37:05,314
<i>Don't arch your back.</i>

492
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:10,521
<i>A full range of motion, exhale up,
inhale down.</i>

493
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:14,073
<i>Lift and down. You can do it. Come on!</i>

494
00:37:14,149 --> 00:37:18,199
<i>Up, keep breathing. Exhale up.</i>

495
00:37:18,278 --> 00:37:20,372
<i>Keep breathing, now lift.</i>

496
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:24,834
<i>And down. Two and down.</i>

497
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:27,537
<i>Keep looking straight ahead.</i>

498
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:29,088
<i>And</i> down.

499
00:37:29,164 --> 00:37:33,135
<i>For a full range of motion. Exhale up.</i>

500
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:35,337
<i>Very controlled.</i>

501
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:38,014
<i>Exhale. Inhale.</i>

502
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:57,696
Thanks.

503
00:38:04,824 --> 00:38:07,828
Girls, I'd like you
to welcome Ms. Annie Herman,

504
00:38:07,911 --> 00:38:12,291
who has very graciously volunteered
to be our new Assistant Troop Leader.

505
00:38:12,373 --> 00:38:14,546
- Hello.
- Hi.

506
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:19,969
Okay, well, let's sit in the friendship circle
and welcome Ms. Herman.

507
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:26,934
Join hands, please.

508
00:38:29,808 --> 00:38:35,815
Okay, now, who would like to be first
to volunteer a thought or a feeling,

509
00:38:35,897 --> 00:38:37,274
share something with us?

510
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:41,160
This troop sucks.

511
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:47,993
Okay. Does everybody feel like that?

512
00:38:48,076 --> 00:38:50,329
- Yeah.
- Chica?

513
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:54,708
At the crafts fair,
we made complete fools of ourselves.

514
00:38:54,791 --> 00:38:57,840
Those creepy Red Feathers
laughed in our faces.

515
00:38:57,919 --> 00:39:01,799
They had a right to.
Did you see all those patches?

516
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:06,474
Yeah, they know how to do everything.
We can't do anything.

517
00:39:07,554 --> 00:39:10,558
Well, let's face it. We're weird.

518
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:14,360
- We're losers.
- Really.

519
00:39:14,435 --> 00:39:18,690
I hate to say it, Mom, but you know it's true.

520
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:23,574
Okay, we're not robust mountain women
<i>as</i> yet.

521
00:39:23,653 --> 00:39:27,203
But that doesn't mean
we can't be crackerjack Wilderness Girls

522
00:39:27,282 --> 00:39:29,159
with plenty of patches.

523
00:39:29,242 --> 00:39:32,667
We could make up our own patches,
couldn't we, Annie?

524
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:34,918
- Pardon?
- I'm sure it's very nice

525
00:39:34,998 --> 00:39:38,047
to know how to live in the forest
and eat bark,

526
00:39:38,126 --> 00:39:41,926
but I'm going to show you girls

527
00:39:42,005 --> 00:39:45,680
how to survive in the wilds of Beverly Hills.

528
00:40:28,384 --> 00:40:30,603
- More cappuccino, girls?
- Yes, please.

529
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:33,852
- I'm fine.
- A croissant might be nice.

530
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:43,570
Please don't bother.
I'll just shave it when I get home.

531
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:46,369
Mrs. Nefler said to give you the works.

532
00:40:56,996 --> 00:40:58,623
Interesting color.

533
00:40:58,706 --> 00:41:00,754
Remarkable clarity.

534
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:02,380
A fine cut.

535
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:05,805
I'd say 82 thou.

536
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:08,683
- That's amazing.
-Isn't it'?

537
00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:12,304
- And it's called a canary diamond?
- Yes.

538
00:41:12,387 --> 00:41:15,140
- Does it sing?
- No.

539
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:18,567
Yes, it does.

540
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:30,826
Okay, let's begin with the Frug.

541
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:32,782
Maestro, if you please.

542
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:09,320
And this one's called the Freddie.

543
00:42:09,402 --> 00:42:11,154
I know, life is so ironic.

544
00:42:20,872 --> 00:42:23,751
Hi, girls. My name is Officer Bill,

545
00:42:23,833 --> 00:42:29,385
and today I am here to demonstrate for you
cardiopulmonary resuscitation,

546
00:42:29,464 --> 00:42:32,843
more commonly known <i>as</i> CPR.

547
00:42:34,469 --> 00:42:36,563
So, I'll need a volunteer.

548
00:42:36,637 --> 00:42:38,310
- Me!
- You.

549
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:41,142
- No, I don't think that's...
- No, no, don't be shy.

550
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:43,853
This'll be very informative.
The girls will love it.

551
00:42:43,936 --> 00:42:46,280
Well, I guess it couldn't hurt.

552
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:52,157
Now lie down and open your mouth.

553
00:42:55,323 --> 00:42:59,544
The last time I did this,
I got more than a patch for it.

554
00:42:59,619 --> 00:43:01,246
Thanks so much.

555
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:35,660
- Would you like a magazine?
- I don't want to read New <i>Woman.</i>

556
00:43:35,738 --> 00:43:37,240
How about this?

557
00:43:37,323 --> 00:43:38,324
<i>I hate Cosmo.</i>

558
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:40,455
How about this?

559
00:44:02,223 --> 00:44:04,100
You guys are fantastic!

560
00:44:06,936 --> 00:44:09,735
Wait. Hold up. Hold up.

561
00:44:12,233 --> 00:44:13,860
Keep dancing!

562
00:44:21,826 --> 00:44:25,626
Mr. Michaelson, is your client
planning to be here or not?

563
00:44:25,705 --> 00:44:28,333
Your Honor,
my client should be here momentarily.

564
00:44:31,836 --> 00:44:33,804
I'm sorry we're late, Your Honor.

565
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:38,306
My troop and I were busy
describing the fall fashions to the blind.

566
00:44:38,384 --> 00:44:41,604
One man said
he could actually feel the colors.

567
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:43,146
It was inspirational.

568
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:45,850
Come on, Phyllis, what is this?

569
00:44:45,933 --> 00:44:48,527
It's a Van Runkle. Isn't it fabulous?

570
00:44:48,603 --> 00:44:49,820
Stunning.

571
00:44:50,479 --> 00:44:55,030
Anyway, the workings
of the wonderful American judiciary system

572
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:57,362
are something
that every child should witness,

573
00:44:57,445 --> 00:44:59,368
especially with a woman like you in charge.

574
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:04,118
Well, I guess it's all right. Okay.

575
00:45:05,453 --> 00:45:06,796
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hi, Daddy.

576
00:45:07,330 --> 00:45:08,832
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Hi, sweetie.

577
00:45:09,749 --> 00:45:12,844
We're here to attest
to the division of property

578
00:45:12,919 --> 00:45:18,141
in the temporary support hearing
of Nefler <i>v.</i> Nefler.

579
00:45:20,259 --> 00:45:23,684
I will set a court date
for six weeks from today.

580
00:45:23,763 --> 00:45:28,394
Your Honor, my client would like to petition
for an earlier court date if possible.

581
00:45:28,476 --> 00:45:31,605
So what's the rush? What is this, Reno?

582
00:45:31,687 --> 00:45:33,815
Never go to Reno, girls.

583
00:45:33,898 --> 00:45:36,742
The California community property laws
can't be beat.

584
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:41,739
The fact of the matter is, Your Honor,

585
00:45:41,822 --> 00:45:45,417
my client may be considering remarriage.

586
00:46:03,052 --> 00:46:05,851
How can she subject
those innocent children to this?

587
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:07,853
She's really sick.

588
00:46:12,103 --> 00:46:15,778
Until this moment,
I never believed we were really through.

589
00:46:15,856 --> 00:46:20,532
Don't give up, Mom.
He'll never really marry her.

590
00:46:23,364 --> 00:46:27,119
It's just a typical male midlife crisis.

591
00:46:27,201 --> 00:46:31,001
See, he's got to prove
that he's still sexually attractive.

592
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:32,457
My dad's been going through it.

593
00:46:33,374 --> 00:46:34,591
How long?

594
00:46:34,667 --> 00:46:35,714
Eleven years.

595
00:46:40,423 --> 00:46:42,221
I need some jewelry.

596
00:46:50,975 --> 00:46:52,397
Divorce Court patch.

597
00:46:55,730 --> 00:46:57,482
Hopefully to be followed by

598
00:46:57,565 --> 00:47:02,412
the remarriage-to-someone-better-
brighter-and-more-appreciative-of-me patch.

599
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:05,781
Yeah.

600
00:47:08,409 --> 00:47:09,831
And that's why

601
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:14,586
the American Indian is responsible
for the turquoise jewelry movement.

602
00:47:16,625 --> 00:47:20,255
That makes 36 patches in three weeks.

603
00:47:21,088 --> 00:47:24,058
I can't believe that. That's so great.

604
00:47:24,133 --> 00:47:25,680
Is that a record or something, Annie?

605
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,262
-It's unbelievable.
- Yeah.

606
00:47:27,345 --> 00:47:28,688
When do we get our patches?

607
00:47:28,763 --> 00:47:31,607
You get your patches at the patch ceremony.

608
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:35,403
It's a little do I'm cooking up.
It'll be at the marina on a boat.

609
00:47:35,478 --> 00:47:38,231
And we'll invite your parents, and
we'll have great goodies, and you'll love it.

610
00:47:38,314 --> 00:47:40,817
And the only thing you have to do
is bring $750 for the patches,

611
00:47:41,609 --> 00:47:43,907
and please RSVP by Thursday.

612
00:47:45,071 --> 00:47:49,201
I'm not coming. It's stupid. It's stupid.

613
00:47:49,283 --> 00:47:50,330
Emily!

614
00:47:57,291 --> 00:47:58,759
What happened?

615
00:47:59,126 --> 00:48:01,970
It's because of the $750. She doesn't have it.

616
00:48:04,382 --> 00:48:05,759
Emily!

617
00:48:07,385 --> 00:48:11,811
Wait up, hon! Em! Yo, Em! Wait up!

618
00:48:13,474 --> 00:48:17,104
Emily! Emily, stop! Will you stop?

619
00:48:17,186 --> 00:48:18,813
I'm sorry!

620
00:48:19,855 --> 00:48:21,152
Thank you.

621
00:48:22,483 --> 00:48:25,236
I haven't been to Jazzercise in three weeks.

622
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:27,162
I don't have the money.

623
00:48:29,365 --> 00:48:32,335
Sit down. Come on, sit down.

624
00:48:35,079 --> 00:48:36,171
Okay.

625
00:48:38,499 --> 00:48:40,877
Emily, I want to tell you a story

626
00:48:42,336 --> 00:48:46,091
about a woman
who lived right here in Beverly Hills

627
00:48:46,173 --> 00:48:49,518
and thought
that money was pretty darn important.

628
00:48:50,428 --> 00:48:55,150
One day, she went to Neiman Marcus
for the linen sale,

629
00:48:55,224 --> 00:49:00,105
and she got these fabulous duvets,
and shams and dust ruffles at 50% off,

630
00:49:00,187 --> 00:49:02,281
two hundred-thread count.

631
00:49:02,356 --> 00:49:06,077
And then she went to pay for them,

632
00:49:06,152 --> 00:49:13,127
and the salesgirl cut her credit card in half
in front of a lot of people.

633
00:49:13,909 --> 00:49:17,083
- Did you have to put everything back?
- Yes.

634
00:49:17,872 --> 00:49:20,546
- Wasn't it embarrassing?
-It was a nightmare.

635
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:24,094
I thought I could never show my face
on Wilshire again.

636
00:49:25,379 --> 00:49:27,882
But I was wrong.

637
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:30,718
These things happen.
They happen to everyone.

638
00:49:34,054 --> 00:49:37,183
Having money isn't the most important thing.

639
00:49:39,727 --> 00:49:42,822
The most important thing is having friends.

640
00:49:43,772 --> 00:49:46,150
Especially friends with money.

641
00:49:49,445 --> 00:49:50,822
Thank you.

642
00:49:52,114 --> 00:49:53,912
And the interest is only 10% a week.

643
00:49:55,159 --> 00:49:58,288
- Just kidding.
- Thanks.

644
00:49:58,370 --> 00:50:00,213
You guys are fabulous.

645
00:50:24,104 --> 00:50:27,529
Chica, I'm so sorry
that your parents couldn't come today.

646
00:50:27,608 --> 00:50:28,951
They're in Caracas.

647
00:50:29,026 --> 00:50:32,200
Besides, I wouldn't have
invited them anyway.

648
00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:35,158
I think she's really warming up, don't you?

649
00:50:37,576 --> 00:50:40,455
Can I have that wine over there?

650
00:50:40,538 --> 00:50:42,040
This needs something.

651
00:50:42,122 --> 00:50:44,921
You can't put wine in hobo stew!

652
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:48,846
Well, of course you can.
What goes better with hobos than wine?

653
00:50:52,967 --> 00:50:56,437
And in addition to the patches
earned by all the girls,

654
00:50:56,512 --> 00:51:01,564
I am proud to present to Tiffany Honigman
the friendship patch,

655
00:51:02,476 --> 00:51:06,902
the shopping patch,
and the jewelry-appraisal patch.

656
00:51:11,819 --> 00:51:13,241
Honey.

657
00:51:14,863 --> 00:51:15,989
Good.

658
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:20,248
And to Lily Marcigan,

659
00:51:20,327 --> 00:51:24,423
for teaching us how to launder money
and crush a revolution,

660
00:51:24,498 --> 00:51:27,547
I'm proud to present
the international-affairs patch.

661
00:51:27,626 --> 00:51:29,128
Congratulations.

662
00:51:30,421 --> 00:51:31,798
Well done.

663
00:51:33,132 --> 00:51:37,603
And to my lovely daughter, Hannah,
I'm proud to present the best-daughter patch.

664
00:51:37,678 --> 00:51:39,851
- Mom!
- Just kidding. Just kidding. I'm sorry. Okay.

665
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:41,978
To this total stranger, Hannah Nefler,

666
00:51:42,057 --> 00:51:46,028
I'm proud to present
the sushi-appreciation patch,

667
00:51:46,562 --> 00:51:50,942
the fire-prevention patch,
and the gardening-with-glamour patch.

668
00:51:51,025 --> 00:51:52,777
I'm so proud of you.

669
00:51:53,235 --> 00:51:54,236
Fred!

670
00:52:00,159 --> 00:52:03,834
Lisa, too bad! Are you okay, honey?

671
00:52:03,912 --> 00:52:06,210
No, damn it! Throw me a lifesaver!

672
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:08,042
No problem.

673
00:52:09,710 --> 00:52:11,929
Butterscotch or Wintergreen?

674
00:52:12,004 --> 00:52:13,472
- What?
- Man.

675
00:52:13,547 --> 00:52:17,427
Stop. She'll be all right. Silicon is buoyant.

676
00:52:21,722 --> 00:52:23,440
Encouraging drunkenness.

677
00:52:25,476 --> 00:52:27,570
Materialism at its worst.

678
00:52:29,188 --> 00:52:30,314
Bribery.

679
00:52:31,398 --> 00:52:33,651
This woman is a complete degenerate.

680
00:52:35,736 --> 00:52:38,865
I think the evidence I have shown here

681
00:52:38,947 --> 00:52:41,996
proves conclusively,
beyond a shadow of a doubt,

682
00:52:42,076 --> 00:52:45,797
that the Beverly Hills troop
should be stripped of their uniforms

683
00:52:45,871 --> 00:52:47,589
and officially disbanded.

684
00:52:47,665 --> 00:52:52,171
And that Nefler woman
should be tossed out on her butt.

685
00:52:52,252 --> 00:52:54,721
Tell me something, Velda.

686
00:52:54,797 --> 00:52:57,550
How did you collect all this information?

687
00:52:57,633 --> 00:53:00,182
Well, I cannot reveal my sources.

688
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:06,063
Your sources show that Mrs. Nefler
has taken an active interest in these girls

689
00:53:06,141 --> 00:53:09,987
and perhaps this troop
has finally found its niche.

690
00:53:11,397 --> 00:53:14,241
I think we'll keep her on for a while.

691
00:53:16,402 --> 00:53:18,120
And by the way, Velda,

692
00:53:18,195 --> 00:53:23,622
we don't go around
tossing our leaders out on their butts.

693
00:53:26,286 --> 00:53:29,085
I guess that means I don't have
to spy on Mrs. Nefler anymore.

694
00:53:29,164 --> 00:53:30,916
Wrong!

695
00:53:30,999 --> 00:53:35,095
Because now is the time
that we have to redouble our efforts.

696
00:53:37,631 --> 00:53:40,885
I think I'll have you move in
with that Nefler woman.

697
00:53:40,968 --> 00:53:43,391
That way, nothing will get past you.

698
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:45,143
Move in with her?

699
00:53:45,222 --> 00:53:49,068
Attention, Kmart shoppers.

700
00:53:49,143 --> 00:53:52,488
Blue light special, aisle 13.

701
00:53:54,022 --> 00:53:59,074
The fumigator said I may not be able
to go back into my apartment for weeks.

702
00:53:59,153 --> 00:54:01,155
Well, you can stay here as long <i>as</i> you like.

703
00:54:01,822 --> 00:54:04,371
That's awfully nice of you.

704
00:54:04,783 --> 00:54:09,209
So what do you do for fun?
Do you have a boyfriend or anything?

705
00:54:09,288 --> 00:54:11,757
Well, it depends on
what you mean by boyfriend.

706
00:54:11,832 --> 00:54:14,927
If you mean a man I go out with...

707
00:54:15,002 --> 00:54:16,299
No.

708
00:54:17,171 --> 00:54:19,845
If you mean like a boy who's just a friend...

709
00:54:21,341 --> 00:54:22,342
No.

710
00:54:24,178 --> 00:54:30,106
Excuse me, Mrs. Nefler. It's Chica.
She's downstairs. She seems really upset.

711
00:54:30,184 --> 00:54:32,312
Chica? Upset?

712
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:35,022
How can you tell?

713
00:54:36,982 --> 00:54:40,407
Chica? What's wrong, sweetheart?

714
00:54:41,361 --> 00:54:43,784
I'd better go.
It was stupid of me to come over here.

715
00:54:43,864 --> 00:54:46,538
No. Sit down. Let's talk.

716
00:54:47,034 --> 00:54:48,126
I'd better go.

717
00:54:48,202 --> 00:54:51,797
Well, at least wait
until I call your parents to pick you up.

718
00:54:51,872 --> 00:54:54,216
My parents are in Monte-Carlo!

719
00:54:56,293 --> 00:54:59,012
Well, I guess it will be a while
before they get here.

720
00:54:59,546 --> 00:55:04,803
It was a last-minute trip.
They didn't mean to leave me on my birthday.

721
00:55:11,767 --> 00:55:13,360
I'm sure they didn't.

722
00:55:13,852 --> 00:55:15,900
They forgot her birthday.

723
00:55:18,524 --> 00:55:21,277
I'm sure they love you very much.

724
00:55:23,821 --> 00:55:25,789
Just give me 10 minutes.

725
00:55:33,413 --> 00:55:38,169
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

726
00:55:38,252 --> 00:55:41,722
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

727
00:55:41,797 --> 00:55:47,270
<i>Happy birthday, dear Chica</i>

728
00:55:47,344 --> 00:55:53,693
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

729
00:55:59,439 --> 00:56:02,784
<i>And remember, any hard-working troop</i>

730
00:56:03,944 --> 00:56:09,701
<i>that sells more than 1,000 boxes
will attend the annual Jamboree.</i>

731
00:56:10,117 --> 00:56:14,873
That Jamboree thing sounds fabulous.
My troop is definitely going.

732
00:56:14,955 --> 00:56:16,207
What is a Jamboree?

733
00:56:16,290 --> 00:56:19,214
<i>I love the smell of cookies in the morning.</i>

734
00:56:19,293 --> 00:56:21,216
<i>All right, let's begin with the M's.</i>

735
00:56:24,131 --> 00:56:25,428
Happy cookie day.

736
00:56:25,507 --> 00:56:28,556
I know you're very busy,
but I wanted you to know

737
00:56:28,635 --> 00:56:33,482
that my girls have earned oodles of patches,
and in record time too.

738
00:56:33,557 --> 00:56:36,231
I am fully aware of what your troop has done.

739
00:56:36,310 --> 00:56:37,732
- Good, good.
- I happen to know

740
00:56:37,811 --> 00:56:42,908
that those so-called patches have nothing
to do with Wilderness ways as I know them

741
00:56:42,983 --> 00:56:45,031
or anyone else
in their right mind knows them.

742
00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:48,034
- I know that...
- I have spoken with Frances Temple,

743
00:56:48,113 --> 00:56:50,332
and I do hereby revoke said patches

744
00:56:50,407 --> 00:56:55,038
so that you and those little froo-froos
do not prance around with them illicitly.

745
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:57,373
- Please, don't...
- Please nothing.

746
00:56:57,456 --> 00:57:00,335
You will turn them in
before you leave here today!

747
00:57:00,417 --> 00:57:02,670
Now, get off my dock.

748
00:57:04,755 --> 00:57:08,726
<i>Let's start with Mar Vista.
How many boxes will you take, Mar Vista?</i>

749
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:11,849
<i>- Forty.
- How many? I can't hear you, Mar Vista!</i>

750
00:57:11,929 --> 00:57:13,397
Forty-two?

751
00:57:14,598 --> 00:57:15,895
<i>Next!</i>

752
00:57:18,393 --> 00:57:22,648
<i>Culver City,
the lovely and talented Red Feathers.</i>

753
00:57:22,731 --> 00:57:25,985
<i>How many boxes are
you little soldiers going to take?</i>

754
00:57:26,068 --> 00:57:29,413
<i>- One thousand.
- All right.</i>

755
00:57:30,656 --> 00:57:32,658
Well, maybe
Velda doesn't understand our patches,

756
00:57:32,741 --> 00:57:36,416
but I'll tell you something
she does understand, cookies.

757
00:57:36,495 --> 00:57:39,123
And I think we could sell enough
that we could make her eat her words.

758
00:57:39,206 --> 00:57:40,958
What do you think?

759
00:57:41,041 --> 00:57:44,090
She can have the patches.
I'm still a Wilderness Girl.

760
00:57:45,379 --> 00:57:46,471
Thank you.

761
00:57:46,546 --> 00:57:50,767
No big deal.
Too many accessories clutter an outfit.

762
00:57:51,635 --> 00:57:52,807
Yes, they do.

763
00:57:52,886 --> 00:57:56,641
Normally, I'd ask for a refund,
but this one's on the house.

764
00:57:58,725 --> 00:58:03,105
Patches. We don't need no stinking patches!

765
00:58:03,897 --> 00:58:06,616
Now how many boxes of cookies
are we gonna sell?

766
00:58:08,902 --> 00:58:10,870
You didn't call Beverly Hills!

767
00:58:12,698 --> 00:58:14,416
<i>Beverly Hills.</i>

768
00:58:14,491 --> 00:58:16,585
Two thousand boxes!

769
00:58:18,912 --> 00:58:20,004
<i>Right.</i>

770
00:58:21,039 --> 00:58:23,542
- Hi. What a lovely shirt you're wearing.
- Why, thank you.

771
00:58:23,625 --> 00:58:25,343
Would you like to buy
some Wilderness Girls cookies?

772
00:58:25,419 --> 00:58:26,671
It's for a very good cause.

773
00:58:26,753 --> 00:58:28,346
I'm sorry. I already bought some.

774
00:58:28,422 --> 00:58:29,969
- From who?
- You did?

775
00:58:30,048 --> 00:58:32,221
From the cute little girls
with the red feathers in their hats.

776
00:58:32,592 --> 00:58:33,764
Sorry.

777
00:58:37,097 --> 00:58:38,394
Hi.

778
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:44,025
Hello. We're selling cookies.
It's for a very good cause.

779
00:58:44,104 --> 00:58:45,196
Would you like to buy some?

780
00:58:45,272 --> 00:58:48,697
I would, but I just bought four boxes
from your friends.

781
00:58:48,775 --> 00:58:50,618
You did?

782
00:58:50,694 --> 00:58:51,946
- Our friends?
- Our friends?

783
00:58:52,029 --> 00:58:53,997
Yeah, you know, the ones with red feathers?

784
00:58:54,406 --> 00:58:55,623
Sorry.

785
00:58:57,284 --> 00:58:58,661
- Red feathers.
- Red feathers.

786
00:58:58,744 --> 00:59:00,246
Thank you, ma'am.

787
00:59:09,463 --> 00:59:13,184
- We did it, Mom!
- Nix on the "Mom" business.

788
00:59:14,134 --> 00:59:18,014
Those stinking Horse Feathers
covered every inch of our turf.

789
00:59:19,514 --> 00:59:23,519
I don't understand it.
They deliberately ruined it for our girls.

790
00:59:23,602 --> 00:59:27,232
That's not what this organization's all about,
is it?

791
00:59:27,314 --> 00:59:31,194
Well, there are some people
in the organization, one in particular,

792
00:59:31,276 --> 00:59:33,574
who believe
that winning is what's important,

793
00:59:33,653 --> 00:59:36,748
no matter who you have to step on
along the way.

794
01:00:00,555 --> 01:00:03,650
So as parents and friends,

795
01:00:03,725 --> 01:00:07,229
you have a wonderful opportunity
to help our troop

796
01:00:07,312 --> 01:00:10,657
and support these fabulous little girls.

797
01:00:10,732 --> 01:00:11,733
What do you think?

798
01:00:11,817 --> 01:00:16,744
Look, if all you're trying to do
is to sell 2,000 boxes of cookies,

799
01:00:16,822 --> 01:00:18,199
why don't we just buy them?

800
01:00:18,573 --> 01:00:20,951
Well, I know. I know.
I thought about that too.

801
01:00:21,034 --> 01:00:22,627
But you know, it misses the point.

802
01:00:22,702 --> 01:00:26,457
The girls need a chance
to get their neighbors involved, you know?

803
01:00:26,540 --> 01:00:28,713
It enhances community spirit.

804
01:00:33,171 --> 01:00:36,971
Would you excuse me just a moment?
Annie, will you take over?

805
01:00:42,889 --> 01:00:45,017
- Good night, Dad.
- Good night, hon.

806
01:00:45,100 --> 01:00:46,192
Good night, sweetie.

807
01:00:49,771 --> 01:00:51,990
I believe you're being paged.

808
01:00:53,150 --> 01:00:56,029
Boy, there's quite a crowd in there,
isn't there?

809
01:00:56,111 --> 01:00:58,739
Well, you've got your peanut butter.
You've got your vanilla.

810
01:00:58,822 --> 01:01:00,790
You've got your creams which are...

811
01:01:00,866 --> 01:01:02,994
How about you? How's the new condo?

812
01:01:03,451 --> 01:01:05,920
It's great. It's great, yeah.

813
01:01:05,996 --> 01:01:08,499
Got some furniture
from Divorced-Guys-R-Us.

814
01:01:08,582 --> 01:01:09,674
Yeah.

815
01:01:11,001 --> 01:01:12,253
Yeah.

816
01:01:16,214 --> 01:01:19,639
It'd be nice if you stayed
for the parents' meeting, you know?

817
01:01:19,718 --> 01:01:22,722
- It would mean a lot to Hannah.
- Gosh, I can't. I mean, I got...

818
01:01:22,804 --> 01:01:25,023
Come on. Look, it's just an hour.

819
01:01:25,098 --> 01:01:29,023
She can pull into the garage and wait

820
01:01:29,102 --> 01:01:30,445
with the motor running.

821
01:01:37,944 --> 01:01:39,867
That certainly took long enough.

822
01:01:39,946 --> 01:01:42,040
I thought maybe
you decided to move back in.

823
01:01:42,115 --> 01:01:43,913
Sorry.

824
01:01:43,992 --> 01:01:46,962
Well, what does she want from you now?

825
01:01:47,037 --> 01:01:51,087
Well, she wanted me to stay
for a meeting about Hannah's troop.

826
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:55,595
Take, take, take.
Boy, that woman's on a total trip.

827
01:01:55,670 --> 01:01:58,469
Well, the Wilderness Girls
are real important to Hannah, you know.

828
01:01:58,548 --> 01:02:00,175
And golly, I don't even know what to do.

829
01:02:00,258 --> 01:02:04,058
You're too young to understand this,
but she'll always be my wife.

830
01:02:04,137 --> 01:02:05,980
What?

831
01:02:06,056 --> 01:02:08,184
I said, "She'll always be my daughter."

832
01:02:08,266 --> 01:02:11,486
You said, "She'll always be my wife."

833
01:02:11,561 --> 01:02:14,485
- I couldn't have said that.
- But you did.

834
01:02:14,564 --> 01:02:16,862
Well, I made a huge mistake.

835
01:02:16,942 --> 01:02:19,536
Yeah, well, that makes two of us.

836
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:24,248
Look, it's obvious
we don't have a solution here.

837
01:02:24,324 --> 01:02:25,541
Phyllis, what's your plan?

838
01:02:25,617 --> 01:02:27,460
The girls and I talked about this,

839
01:02:27,535 --> 01:02:30,755
and we came up with some great ideas
to get the whole community involved.

840
01:02:30,830 --> 01:02:31,956
For example.

841
01:02:36,586 --> 01:02:40,261
<i>Gather around, you friends of mine</i>

842
01:02:40,340 --> 01:02:43,810
<i>We're Wilderness Girls, and it's cookie time</i>

843
01:02:43,885 --> 01:02:47,389
<i>We work hard, and we play fair</i>

844
01:02:47,472 --> 01:02:51,602
<i>So buy a box and do your share</i>

845
01:02:51,685 --> 01:02:55,440
<i>- If you want the best taste you can find
- Yeah, yeah</i>

846
01:02:55,522 --> 01:02:59,277
<i>- Chocolate chips are one of</i> a <i>kind
- Yeah, yeah</i>

847
01:02:59,359 --> 01:03:03,956
<i>- Our peanut butter treats will blow your mind
- Yeah, yeah</i>

848
01:03:04,030 --> 01:03:06,749
<i>- A box of them would be so nice
- Box of</i>

849
01:03:06,825 --> 01:03:10,796
<i>- Cheap at even twice the price
- Twice the</i>

850
01:03:10,870 --> 01:03:14,625
<i>I said come on down, come on down
It's cookie time</i>

851
01:03:14,708 --> 01:03:18,338
<i>It's cookie time
It's cookie time</i>

852
01:03:18,420 --> 01:03:21,765
<i>It's cookie time, cookie time, cookie time</i>

853
01:03:26,636 --> 01:03:27,762
Here, catch!

854
01:03:27,846 --> 01:03:31,601
I've got two dollars. Exact change.
Thank you.

855
01:03:35,937 --> 01:03:40,613
Cigars, cigarettes, cookies.
Cigars, cigarettes.

856
01:03:40,775 --> 01:03:42,823
Peanut butter or mint?

857
01:03:42,902 --> 01:03:45,655
- Do you take American Express?
- We prefer Visa.

858
01:03:46,156 --> 01:03:49,330
<i>Cookies always cause such a fuss</i>

859
01:03:49,409 --> 01:03:53,414
<i>Full of sugar and spice
Just like us</i>

860
01:03:53,747 --> 01:03:57,001
<i>We need your dough, so don't you pause</i>

861
01:03:57,375 --> 01:04:01,300
<i>We're Wilderness Girls
And we're a real good cause</i>

862
01:04:01,379 --> 01:04:05,100
<i>- If you want</i> a <i>taste that's nice and sweet
- Yeah, yeah</i>

863
01:04:05,175 --> 01:04:08,805
<i>- You won't find something better to eat
- Yeah, yeah</i>

864
01:04:08,928 --> 01:04:12,774
<i>- Doesn't your mouth deserve a treat?
- Yeah, yeah</i>

865
01:04:12,891 --> 01:04:16,521
<i>- A box of them would be so nice
- Nice</i>

866
01:04:16,603 --> 01:04:19,026
<i>Cheap at even twice the price</i>

867
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:36,418
- I'm not ruining your diet.
- Two dollars.

868
01:04:37,374 --> 01:04:39,468
Ms. Pia Zadora.

869
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:47,430
She is smashingly sheathed
in this season's hottest style,

870
01:04:47,509 --> 01:04:49,182
the Wilderness look.

871
01:04:51,971 --> 01:04:53,063
Would you like to buy some cookies?

872
01:04:53,515 --> 01:04:56,064
- Would you like some cookies?
- Yes.

873
01:04:56,142 --> 01:04:57,985
You have to buy them.

874
01:04:58,061 --> 01:04:59,779
Dr. Joyce Brothers.

875
01:05:04,275 --> 01:05:08,826
Clad in khaki for a lunch
at Ie bistro or a walk in the woods.

876
01:05:12,992 --> 01:05:15,916
My broker <i>says</i> it's a fabulous investment.

877
01:05:15,995 --> 01:05:17,542
Mrs. Phyllis Nefler.

878
01:05:21,167 --> 01:05:24,967
Mrs. Nefler is the culprit
behind this khaki mania.

879
01:05:25,046 --> 01:05:30,143
And her ensemble
is the epitome of this season's hottest trend.

880
01:05:33,012 --> 01:05:35,014
Your mom is so cool.

881
01:05:35,098 --> 01:05:37,271
She put this whole thing together.

882
01:05:37,350 --> 01:05:39,603
Yeah. She's amazing.

883
01:05:40,645 --> 01:05:43,273
- I just wish my dad could see it.
- Yeah.

884
01:05:45,692 --> 01:05:46,784
Thank you, Robin.

885
01:05:46,860 --> 01:05:51,366
And if you loved our <i>haute</i> couture,
you'll adore our haute cuisine.

886
01:05:51,448 --> 01:05:53,371
Buy some cookies today.

887
01:05:54,784 --> 01:05:57,879
It's khaki wishes and cookie dreams.

888
01:05:59,706 --> 01:06:00,832
You are so fabulous.

889
01:06:00,915 --> 01:06:02,292
- No, you're fabulous.
- No, you...

890
01:06:02,375 --> 01:06:05,254
- No, you.
- You're fabulous, fabulous, fabulous.

891
01:06:09,674 --> 01:06:12,302
<i>- Plendor here.
- Velda, Phyllis Nefler.</i>

892
01:06:12,385 --> 01:06:16,390
Listen, I had a little surprise for you.
We didn't sell 2,000 boxes of cookies.

893
01:06:16,890 --> 01:06:19,313
Well, that's no surprise to me.
I knew you couldn't.

894
01:06:19,392 --> 01:06:26,025
<i>We sold 4,732 boxes. Isn't that fabulous?</i>

895
01:06:26,107 --> 01:06:28,826
<i>Listen, the Barnfells
are throwing a gala this evening,</i>

896
01:06:28,902 --> 01:06:32,281
and we'd love you to be there
for the check presentation.

897
01:06:32,363 --> 01:06:38,791
8:00-ish, black tie, 7O Hillcrest,
across from that garish Suroc mansion.

898
01:06:38,870 --> 01:06:40,588
So, see you then.

899
01:06:49,422 --> 01:06:52,141
It was a warm and sultry evening.

900
01:06:52,217 --> 01:06:55,346
She looked stunning.
Everything was going wonderfully.

901
01:06:55,428 --> 01:06:57,897
Thanks for throwing this fabulous party.

902
01:06:57,972 --> 01:07:00,100
Phyllis, we want to thank you

903
01:07:00,183 --> 01:07:03,232
for giving our little girl a birthday party
while we were away.

904
01:07:03,311 --> 01:07:06,190
- I am terrible with dates.
- Yes.

905
01:07:06,272 --> 01:07:10,652
Everyone was there,
all the Beverly Hills glitterati.

906
01:07:10,735 --> 01:07:15,912
It all looked so civilized,
but really, it was a black-tied jungle.

907
01:07:16,616 --> 01:07:20,211
Tessa told me your idea
about using Emily's dad in my next picture.

908
01:07:20,286 --> 01:07:24,792
- Well...
- I want you to meet the new mob father.

909
01:07:29,921 --> 01:07:31,468
Fabulous.

910
01:07:31,548 --> 01:07:35,303
Thanks so much for helping me out,
helping me get this part.

911
01:07:35,385 --> 01:07:37,683
I couldn't get a job in this town.

912
01:07:37,762 --> 01:07:39,935
And Emily thanks you too.

913
01:07:45,645 --> 01:07:48,239
Mrs. Nefler, meet Cinderella.

914
01:07:49,023 --> 01:07:52,903
Annie, you look fabulous.

915
01:07:52,986 --> 01:07:54,454
How did this happen?

916
01:07:54,529 --> 01:07:57,999
Well, Hannah did my makeup,
and Rosa raided your closet.

917
01:07:58,074 --> 01:07:59,826
You really like it?

918
01:08:01,828 --> 01:08:05,378
Excuse me, Cheech? Hi,
I'd like you to meet Annie Herman.

919
01:08:06,416 --> 01:08:08,635
Annie Herman!

920
01:08:10,587 --> 01:08:12,931
Wanna wrestle?

921
01:08:13,006 --> 01:08:14,758
Are you related to Pee-wee?

922
01:08:15,216 --> 01:08:18,436
Madam, would you mind telling me the truth?

923
01:08:18,511 --> 01:08:21,936
How many pairs of shoes do you really have?

924
01:08:22,015 --> 01:08:24,814
Why, what are you implying, Mr. Christy?

925
01:08:26,102 --> 01:08:29,402
Do you like people
to call you Dictator or just Dick'?

926
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:32,074
Just call me Bong Bong, please.

927
01:08:32,150 --> 01:08:35,029
- May I call you Phyllis?
- Sure, sure, Bong Bong.

928
01:08:36,446 --> 01:08:38,790
Troop Leader of the Year?

929
01:08:38,865 --> 01:08:39,991
- Hi.
- Hi.

930
01:08:40,074 --> 01:08:43,123
- Sir, may I cut in, dance with my wife?
- Certainly.

931
01:08:43,202 --> 01:08:45,876
- It was a pleasure, miss.
- And for me.

932
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:50,920
Phyl, I got to hand it to you.

933
01:08:51,002 --> 01:08:53,596
- You did it.
- I did?

934
01:08:53,671 --> 01:08:57,721
Yeah. I mean,
you turned yourself around completely.

935
01:08:59,969 --> 01:09:02,392
- Well...
- Yeah.

936
01:09:02,472 --> 01:09:06,318
I got to tell you something else.
You look great.

937
01:09:06,392 --> 01:09:11,193
It's different and everything,
but I mean, it's softer somehow.

938
01:09:12,357 --> 01:09:13,358
Yes.

939
01:09:16,069 --> 01:09:19,619
So, where's Lisa, or is it past her bedtime?

940
01:09:19,697 --> 01:09:21,745
Boy, way past, I'll tell you.

941
01:09:21,824 --> 01:09:24,077
I'm not seeing her anymore.

942
01:09:26,371 --> 01:09:29,170
No, and I'll tell you something else.

943
01:09:31,334 --> 01:09:35,589
I am really very, very proud of you.
I just had to say that.

944
01:09:38,466 --> 01:09:41,015
Well, I'm kind of proud of me too.

945
01:09:44,222 --> 01:09:47,066
And there's something very important
I have to talk to you about.

946
01:09:51,354 --> 01:09:52,776
Nefler.

947
01:09:53,940 --> 01:09:57,114
Velda, I'm so glad you could make it.

948
01:09:58,277 --> 01:10:01,156
This is our commander in chief,
Velda Plendor.

949
01:10:01,239 --> 01:10:04,709
This is my... This is Freddy Nefler.

950
01:10:05,993 --> 01:10:09,293
Hey, how you doing? Pleasure to meet you.

951
01:10:09,372 --> 01:10:13,798
- Well, I guess we can talk about it later?
- Sure, sure, of course we can.

952
01:10:16,462 --> 01:10:20,467
- So, I guess you have something for me first?
- Yes, abso/ument.

953
01:10:26,013 --> 01:10:31,645
I want you all to welcome
our esteemed district leader, Velda Plendor,

954
01:10:31,811 --> 01:10:33,984
who's been gracious enough to stop by

955
01:10:34,063 --> 01:10:38,614
to acknowledge the achievement of
our fabulous Beverly Hills Wilderness Girls.

956
01:10:47,243 --> 01:10:50,087
And next it's on to the annual Jamboree

957
01:10:50,163 --> 01:10:52,165
where our girls will compete

958
01:10:52,248 --> 01:10:56,173
for the ultimate honor
of being next year's poster troop.

959
01:10:57,003 --> 01:10:58,755
And we're going to win.

960
01:11:04,761 --> 01:11:06,763
I guess my big break came
when I was playing Ace,

961
01:11:06,846 --> 01:11:07,972
a photographer on The <i>Love</i> Boat.

962
01:11:08,055 --> 01:11:09,978
- You were good.
- Thanks.

963
01:11:10,057 --> 01:11:12,685
- Do you know Gopher?
- Yeah, he's a good friend of mine.

964
01:11:14,187 --> 01:11:19,444
You traitor. Look at you, you cheap slut.

965
01:11:19,525 --> 01:11:22,870
- Your next stop is Kmart.
- Screw you, Velda.

966
01:11:26,073 --> 01:11:27,996
I don't usually talk that way.

967
01:11:28,075 --> 01:11:29,668
I liked it.

968
01:11:29,744 --> 01:11:32,042
You are very sexy. Really.

969
01:11:34,540 --> 01:11:37,635
So, you don't hate me anymore?

970
01:11:38,294 --> 01:11:41,093
Fred, I never hated you.

971
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:46,470
I was angry with you, and I was hurt.

972
01:11:47,970 --> 01:11:54,228
But now I realize
that our splitting up was positive.

973
01:11:56,729 --> 01:11:59,824
- Positive?
- Well, constructive.

974
01:12:01,859 --> 01:12:05,580
I feel like I've grown a lot
in the last few months.

975
01:12:06,739 --> 01:12:08,787
Boy, yeah, you really have.

976
01:12:15,706 --> 01:12:18,755
So what was it
you wanted to talk to me about?

977
01:12:21,420 --> 01:12:24,094
- Hannah.
- Hannah?

978
01:12:25,675 --> 01:12:28,428
- Yeah.
- What about Hannah?

979
01:12:29,178 --> 01:12:31,852
Well, you know, I realize
that ever since we've been separated,

980
01:12:31,931 --> 01:12:36,061
Phyl, just how much she means to me,

981
01:12:36,936 --> 01:12:41,942
and I just think that when the divorce is final,
I want joint custody of Hannah.

982
01:12:42,024 --> 01:12:44,322
That's what you wanted to talk to me about?

983
01:12:45,695 --> 01:12:48,073
Yeah, and I sure didn't want to hurt you,
Phyl, but you know,

984
01:12:48,155 --> 01:12:51,125
she's my daughter too,
and I'd like her to spend some time with me,

985
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:53,999
say, like, on the weekends.
I'd like to get through...

986
01:12:55,079 --> 01:12:56,797
Good night, Freddy.

987
01:12:59,458 --> 01:13:04,931
Help! I'm drowning. God. I'm...

988
01:13:17,018 --> 01:13:19,817
Hi, going through a divorce.

989
01:13:25,943 --> 01:13:27,411
Come in.

990
01:13:27,486 --> 01:13:30,456
Hannah, I washed your yellow sweatshirt.

991
01:13:31,782 --> 01:13:32,999
Thanks, Mom.

992
01:13:33,075 --> 01:13:36,921
Rosa will be back before you do
any more of my laundry, won't she?

993
01:13:36,996 --> 01:13:40,000
- Yeah, I guess so.
- Where'd she go, anyway?

994
01:13:40,082 --> 01:13:43,507
- Mexico. Her grandmother died.
- Again'?

995
01:13:45,922 --> 01:13:49,347
You're taking your Laura Ashley doll?

996
01:13:49,425 --> 01:13:52,520
Dad thought
I should keep some stuff at his house.

997
01:13:53,387 --> 01:13:55,856
There's plenty food in the freezer.

998
01:13:55,932 --> 01:13:58,936
If you need anything, just call me.
You've got Dad's number.

999
01:13:59,018 --> 01:14:00,645
And don't stay up too late, okay?

1000
01:14:00,728 --> 01:14:04,949
Thank you. I'm a grown-up person.
I think I can take care of myself.

1001
01:14:06,359 --> 01:14:09,329
- Are you ready, Peaches?
- Coming, Dad.

1002
01:14:10,655 --> 01:14:13,625
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye. Have fun.

1003
01:14:14,700 --> 01:14:17,169
- I love you, Hannah.
- Love you too.

1004
01:14:26,796 --> 01:14:28,048
Hannah?

1005
01:14:31,592 --> 01:14:34,061
Did you forget something, honey?

1006
01:14:34,929 --> 01:14:38,229
I bet you thought that was pretty cute
last night, didn't you, Nefler?

1007
01:14:38,307 --> 01:14:40,435
- What?
- Putting on that little show

1008
01:14:40,518 --> 01:14:42,987
for all your hotsy-totsy friends?

1009
01:14:43,980 --> 01:14:45,778
Well, you didn't just embarrass me.

1010
01:14:45,856 --> 01:14:48,484
You embarrassed
the Wilderness Girls of America.

1011
01:14:50,027 --> 01:14:53,531
I never intended on embarrassing anyone.

1012
01:14:54,198 --> 01:14:55,666
You're dangerous, Nefler.

1013
01:14:56,075 --> 01:15:01,673
You think this is all a game, don't you?
Well, my Jamboree is no joke.

1014
01:15:01,747 --> 01:15:06,594
That's the real wilderness out there.
That's not some Beverly Hills backyard.

1015
01:15:06,669 --> 01:15:11,266
You got mountains, swamps, wild animals.

1016
01:15:11,882 --> 01:15:13,725
They don't take credit cards.

1017
01:15:13,801 --> 01:15:15,348
I'm warning you, Nefler.

1018
01:15:16,053 --> 01:15:20,308
Somebody is gonna get hurt,
and it's gonna be all your fault.

1019
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:29,617
Well, the reason you're winning
is I got grease on my controller.

1020
01:15:32,028 --> 01:15:34,827
- Want some more pizza?
- I'm stuffed.

1021
01:15:34,905 --> 01:15:37,624
- How about some more soda?
- No, I'm fine.

1022
01:15:37,700 --> 01:15:40,670
You're tired of the game?
Okay, let's go to 31 Flavors.

1023
01:15:40,745 --> 01:15:43,874
- I'm ready. Come on.
- Dad, will you please stop?

1024
01:15:43,956 --> 01:15:46,755
You don't have to feed me
and entertain me every second.

1025
01:15:48,794 --> 01:15:50,137
You mean, I'm trying too hard?

1026
01:15:51,547 --> 01:15:53,094
A little.

1027
01:15:56,302 --> 01:15:57,645
Sorry.

1028
01:15:59,513 --> 01:16:02,232
I know this is hard for you and Mom,

1029
01:16:02,308 --> 01:16:06,233
but it's really hard for me too.
I feel like a ping-pong ball.

1030
01:16:08,105 --> 01:16:11,154
I just wish that you guys
would get back together again.

1031
01:16:13,486 --> 01:16:14,908
Come here.

1032
01:16:19,450 --> 01:16:21,123
So do I, Peaches.

1033
01:16:24,497 --> 01:16:27,467
<i>Memories</i>

1034
01:16:28,793 --> 01:16:32,343
<i>Light the corners of my mind</i>

1035
01:16:36,592 --> 01:16:40,222
<i>Misty watercolor
memories...</i>

1036
01:16:45,184 --> 01:16:48,188
Phyllis! Are you upstairs?

1037
01:16:53,317 --> 01:16:54,694
My God.

1038
01:16:56,362 --> 01:16:59,912
<i>This</i> looks <i>like</i> a <i>scene
out of Valley of the Dolls.</i>

1039
01:17:06,789 --> 01:17:08,712
Give me another bottle of Evian.

1040
01:17:10,042 --> 01:17:11,339
Don't you think you've had enough?

1041
01:17:11,836 --> 01:17:14,305
Shut up and bring me the bottle.

1042
01:17:17,550 --> 01:17:19,427
My life is over.

1043
01:17:22,805 --> 01:17:25,399
I brought up your mail.

1044
01:17:25,474 --> 01:17:27,977
There's something from the family court.

1045
01:17:32,857 --> 01:17:35,736
I want these burned

1046
01:17:35,818 --> 01:17:39,243
and the ashes scattered over Forest Lawn.

1047
01:17:40,281 --> 01:17:43,205
Come on. Get up. I'll make you a cappuccino,

1048
01:17:43,284 --> 01:17:46,504
and we'll go over to Betsy's,
and we'll play some doubles.

1049
01:17:47,079 --> 01:17:49,002
I'm not going anywhere.

1050
01:17:49,081 --> 01:17:52,381
You cannot just lie there.

1051
01:17:52,459 --> 01:17:54,427
Come on. We'll go to Rodolfo's.

1052
01:17:55,004 --> 01:17:57,302
I've lost my will to shop.

1053
01:17:59,300 --> 01:18:01,428
Phyllis, that's not funny.

1054
01:18:05,097 --> 01:18:07,896
Velda was mean, but she was right.

1055
01:18:07,975 --> 01:18:12,526
It's one thing to try and convince myself
that I'm a real troop leader,

1056
01:18:13,272 --> 01:18:18,950
but to lead you girls into danger
just to save my own pride would be criminal,

1057
01:18:19,612 --> 01:18:21,614
and I won't do it.

1058
01:18:22,781 --> 01:18:28,504
Now I want to say
that I have loved our times together,

1059
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:34,210
and I will treasure them always.

1060
01:18:35,002 --> 01:18:38,131
But it's over now.

1061
01:18:40,799 --> 01:18:42,176
Girls?

1062
01:18:44,762 --> 01:18:47,811
Sorry, Mrs. Nefler, but a deal's a deal.

1063
01:18:47,890 --> 01:18:49,312
You can't quit.

1064
01:18:50,184 --> 01:18:54,234
You wouldn't let me run away,
and we won't let you either.

1065
01:18:56,357 --> 01:18:58,735
Don't you realize what you've done for us?

1066
01:19:00,694 --> 01:19:04,870
- You're our role model.
- And our friend.

1067
01:19:05,991 --> 01:19:07,288
Mrs. Nefler,

1068
01:19:07,826 --> 01:19:14,254
you took a group of over-indulged,
unmotivated, alienated, preadolescents

1069
01:19:14,333 --> 01:19:17,007
and gave us renewed sense of self-esteem.

1070
01:19:18,295 --> 01:19:22,596
I think what she means to say is
that you made us like ourselves.

1071
01:19:22,675 --> 01:19:26,100
We're a team now.
We can win any competition.

1072
01:19:26,178 --> 01:19:27,930
We can whoop the wilderness.

1073
01:19:28,013 --> 01:19:32,519
We ain't scared of nothing
as long <i>as</i> we have you.

1074
01:19:34,311 --> 01:19:38,657
They're right, Phyl.
You've come too far to quit now.

1075
01:19:48,284 --> 01:19:53,381
And now the main event
of the annual Wilderness Jamboree,

1076
01:19:54,290 --> 01:19:56,463
the survival competition.

1077
01:19:56,542 --> 01:20:01,298
Each troop must follow the path
that is designated by your color flag.

1078
01:20:02,798 --> 01:20:05,972
Our blue flags
were for our Beverly Hills sisters,

1079
01:20:06,051 --> 01:20:10,227
but it appears
that they've opted not to compete.

1080
01:20:11,140 --> 01:20:15,270
Soto the rest of you, I say good luck.

1081
01:20:15,352 --> 01:20:17,446
May the best troop win.

1082
01:20:17,521 --> 01:20:21,151
On your marks, get set...

1083
01:20:22,735 --> 01:20:25,909
What is that noise? What is that noise?

1084
01:20:36,373 --> 01:20:41,095
Careful, careful, easy. Yeah, here we come.

1085
01:20:44,673 --> 01:20:48,428
Get your damn car out of my friendship ring.

1086
01:20:49,345 --> 01:20:51,848
Hi, Vel. Lovely to see you too.

1087
01:20:51,930 --> 01:20:54,649
Okay, fine, on your mark, get set, go.

1088
01:21:07,154 --> 01:21:09,577
We have to hurry. We have to get
to that table with the blue banner.

1089
01:21:09,656 --> 01:21:11,078
Put on those arm bands. Come on.

1090
01:21:11,158 --> 01:21:14,037
The table with the blue banners, girls.
There should be a map and a compass.

1091
01:21:14,119 --> 01:21:15,120
Hi, Velda.

1092
01:21:17,081 --> 01:21:18,253
Just a second, Herman.

1093
01:21:18,332 --> 01:21:21,802
Only Wilderness Girls and Troop Leaders
are allowed to participate in this.

1094
01:21:21,877 --> 01:21:23,971
- I'm an assistant troop leader.
- Yeah.

1095
01:21:24,046 --> 01:21:26,595
Not anymore you aren't. I just fired you.

1096
01:21:26,673 --> 01:21:29,722
- What? Are you kidding me?
- She can't do that. That's not fair.

1097
01:21:29,802 --> 01:21:31,725
And Nefler, you better get moving.

1098
01:21:31,804 --> 01:21:33,602
It's 20 miles to the nearest campsite,

1099
01:21:33,680 --> 01:21:36,604
and it's about 100 miles
to the nearest four-star hotel.

1100
01:21:36,683 --> 01:21:38,481
Take your pick.

1101
01:21:41,063 --> 01:21:44,658
Phyllis? I can't let you
take the girls out there alone.

1102
01:21:44,733 --> 01:21:48,658
- Why not?
- Because you get lost in your walk-in closet.

1103
01:21:48,737 --> 01:21:52,082
Not anymore. We've got a map here.

1104
01:21:52,157 --> 01:21:55,707
The route is marked.
We just follow the little blue flags, right?

1105
01:21:55,786 --> 01:21:56,753
- Right.
- Yeah.

1106
01:21:56,829 --> 01:21:59,173
We'll be fine. We're Troop Beverly Hills.

1107
01:21:59,248 --> 01:22:01,967
- Yeah!
- We are winners! Okay, let's go.

1108
01:22:03,085 --> 01:22:06,089
Remember, the troop that gets back here
in the shortest time wins.

1109
01:22:06,171 --> 01:22:08,265
You'll be timed from here
to the midpoint tonight.

1110
01:22:08,340 --> 01:22:12,061
Bivouac there, and then tomorrow
you race into the finish line. Got it?

1111
01:22:12,136 --> 01:22:13,729
Sure, sure, I got it.

1112
01:22:13,804 --> 01:22:16,774
Do you know how to use a compass?

1113
01:22:16,849 --> 01:22:20,103
- I can learn.
- Don't worry, Mom. I can do it.

1114
01:22:21,061 --> 01:22:23,484
- Is that a snake?
- No, it's not.

1115
01:22:23,564 --> 01:22:28,445
- Emily, is that poison oak?
- Gross, yuck.

1116
01:22:28,527 --> 01:22:33,033
Okay, now, north is that way.
Which way is the campsite?

1117
01:22:35,242 --> 01:22:36,835
I can do this.

1118
01:22:37,536 --> 01:22:41,757
Gucci's just north of Wilshire.
The Beverly Wilshire Hotel is west.

1119
01:22:42,708 --> 01:22:45,882
I think the campsite is at Cartier, so to speak.

1120
01:22:45,961 --> 01:22:48,089
You guys, there's the blue flag.

1121
01:23:03,228 --> 01:23:05,572
Backhand's a little rusty.

1122
01:23:16,033 --> 01:23:17,831
All right, another blue flag.

1123
01:23:27,044 --> 01:23:30,674
Annie, something's kind of fishy here.

1124
01:23:30,756 --> 01:23:32,133
Where are you?

1125
01:23:32,216 --> 01:23:36,517
We're standing in a jungle of reeds
with goo up to our ankles.

1126
01:23:36,595 --> 01:23:38,893
<i>It sounds like Dead Man's Swamp.</i>

1127
01:23:38,972 --> 01:23:40,098
Good.

1128
01:23:43,310 --> 01:23:49,943
Annie, do rattlesnakes live in swamps?

1129
01:23:50,943 --> 01:23:52,786
No, they hate water.

1130
01:23:54,279 --> 01:23:56,532
Thank God. Thanks, Annie.

1131
01:23:56,615 --> 01:23:59,164
<i>Water moccasins live in swamps.</i>

1132
01:23:59,243 --> 01:24:02,838
<i>They're just as deadly, but
they don't make any noise before they strike.</i>

1133
01:24:07,167 --> 01:24:09,465
Philly? Phyllis?

1134
01:24:10,128 --> 01:24:13,723
<i>Are you there? Phyllis? Phyllis?</i>

1135
01:24:17,010 --> 01:24:20,139
What an adventure.
Isn't nature fabulous, girls?

1136
01:24:27,646 --> 01:24:29,740
I'm very proud of you girls. Terrific.

1137
01:24:29,815 --> 01:24:31,567
Good spirit, Tiffany.

1138
01:24:33,235 --> 01:24:35,033
Good spirit, girls.

1139
01:24:35,821 --> 01:24:39,792
A few positive words from me,
and they get their second wind.

1140
01:24:44,788 --> 01:24:46,836
Six hours, 27 minutes.

1141
01:24:47,207 --> 01:24:51,178
Anytime now, those Red Feathers
will be coming up right over that horizon.

1142
01:24:51,253 --> 01:24:55,679
Setting the new record time
for the first half of this competition.

1143
01:24:56,133 --> 01:24:59,182
We're number one. We're number one.

1144
01:24:59,261 --> 01:25:01,263
There they are.

1145
01:25:01,346 --> 01:25:04,225
We're number one. We're number one.

1146
01:25:13,525 --> 01:25:16,324
No. No.

1147
01:25:18,196 --> 01:25:19,994
Halt. Nefler.

1148
01:25:31,627 --> 01:25:35,052
You're gonna pay for this. Yes, you are.

1149
01:25:46,058 --> 01:25:51,531
Redondo Beach, seven hours 21 minutes.
Pomona, seven hours and four minutes.

1150
01:25:51,605 --> 01:25:55,155
Red Feathers, six hours 29 minutes.

1151
01:25:55,233 --> 01:25:58,282
Beverly Hills,
six hours, 28 and a half minutes.

1152
01:25:58,362 --> 01:26:00,660
Do you hear that?
I thought you said we were gonna win?

1153
01:26:00,739 --> 01:26:04,084
You are. Just leave it to me.

1154
01:26:04,159 --> 01:26:06,582
- Grundman?
- Yes, sir... Ma'am.

1155
01:26:06,662 --> 01:26:10,087
I'm gonna be taking over tomorrow.
You're going to be too sick to continue.

1156
01:26:10,165 --> 01:26:11,758
I am?

1157
01:26:17,172 --> 01:26:19,891
There's been a slight change of plans.

1158
01:26:19,966 --> 01:26:22,389
Mrs. Grundman is gravely ill.

1159
01:26:22,928 --> 01:26:26,353
I have no other option
but to lead the Red Feathers myself.

1160
01:26:26,431 --> 01:26:28,729
What? That's not fair.

1161
01:26:28,809 --> 01:26:31,028
That's not fair. She mapped out the course.

1162
01:26:31,103 --> 01:26:34,949
The second leg of the competition
will begin on my command.

1163
01:26:35,023 --> 01:26:37,526
Ready, set, go.

1164
01:26:39,277 --> 01:26:44,659
Come on. Come on.
Come on. Come on. Come on.

1165
01:26:48,787 --> 01:26:52,587
Because that buffalo butt is breaking
every rule by joining those little monsters

1166
01:26:52,666 --> 01:26:55,044
doesn't mean we can't be good sports, right?

1167
01:26:55,127 --> 01:26:56,128
Right!

1168
01:26:56,211 --> 01:26:59,431
- Yeah, we played by the rules, right?
- Right!

1169
01:26:59,506 --> 01:27:01,759
And we're gonna win, right?

1170
01:27:01,842 --> 01:27:04,220
- Right!
- Right.

1171
01:27:04,302 --> 01:27:05,975
Five, six, seven, eight.

1172
01:27:06,054 --> 01:27:08,056
<i>We're the girls from Beverly Hills</i>

1173
01:27:08,140 --> 01:27:09,813
One, two, three, four.

1174
01:27:09,891 --> 01:27:11,768
<i>Shopping is our greatest skill</i>

1175
01:27:11,852 --> 01:27:13,695
Five, six, seven, eight.

1176
01:27:13,770 --> 01:27:15,647
<i>We will fight and try real hard</i>

1177
01:27:15,731 --> 01:27:17,404
One, two, three, four.

1178
01:27:17,482 --> 01:27:19,405
<i>Leave behind our credit card</i>

1179
01:27:19,484 --> 01:27:21,202
Five, six, seven, eight.

1180
01:27:21,278 --> 01:27:24,908
<i>Beverly Hills, what a thrill
Beverly Hills, what a thrill</i>

1181
01:27:24,990 --> 01:27:28,415
<i>Beverly Hills, what a thrill
Beverly Hills, what a thrill</i>

1182
01:27:28,493 --> 01:27:32,214
<i>Beverly Hills, what a thrill
Beverly Hills, what a thrill</i>

1183
01:27:48,597 --> 01:27:50,144
No.

1184
01:27:52,601 --> 01:27:56,731
Well, au revoir, mon Jamboree.

1185
01:27:58,899 --> 01:28:04,281
Well, hey, you know, we got into the woods,
and we had a nice time.

1186
01:28:04,362 --> 01:28:06,160
That's a crock of shit.

1187
01:28:06,239 --> 01:28:09,118
Damn it! Damn it! Damn it! Damn it!

1188
01:28:09,201 --> 01:28:13,251
Just once, I would like to go the distance.

1189
01:28:14,498 --> 01:28:15,545
Mom.

1190
01:28:18,835 --> 01:28:23,090
It really frosts my cookies
that we have worked so hard,

1191
01:28:23,173 --> 01:28:27,474
and we have come so far,
and now we have to stop.

1192
01:28:27,552 --> 01:28:30,556
Not necessarily. Look.

1193
01:28:36,645 --> 01:28:40,775
Wait, wait, wait, wait. No.
No, I can't let you do this.

1194
01:28:40,857 --> 01:28:43,030
I can do it, Morn.
It's just like the balance beam.

1195
01:28:43,109 --> 01:28:47,330
This is no balance beam, honey.
This isn't even a bridge. This is a log.

1196
01:28:47,405 --> 01:28:51,410
It's very treacherous,
and that is a very, very deep ravine.

1197
01:28:52,077 --> 01:28:54,296
Only an idiot would walk across that.

1198
01:28:54,371 --> 01:28:55,748
I'm going to do it.

1199
01:28:55,831 --> 01:28:57,504
Mom, you're afraid of heights.

1200
01:28:57,582 --> 01:29:01,587
You fell off the garden wall
when you were spying on Dad.

1201
01:29:01,670 --> 01:29:05,766
I wasn't spying on Dad.
I was checking on my azaleas.

1202
01:29:06,299 --> 01:29:09,018
I was spying on Dad.
But that's not really the point here.

1203
01:29:09,094 --> 01:29:13,019
The point is that I'm the adult.
I'm the responsible one.

1204
01:29:13,932 --> 01:29:17,186
And for a change, I'm gonna take care of you.

1205
01:29:18,144 --> 01:29:20,693
You always have.

1206
01:29:20,772 --> 01:29:23,195
- I have?
- Yeah.

1207
01:29:24,109 --> 01:29:26,203
Me and seven other girls.

1208
01:29:27,863 --> 01:29:30,457
Yeah, you're a lucky kid.

1209
01:29:31,867 --> 01:29:34,495
- Be careful.
- Okay.

1210
01:29:44,671 --> 01:29:46,389
If I get across...

1211
01:29:46,464 --> 01:29:51,391
When, when I get across,
I want you to go down to the bridge,

1212
01:29:51,469 --> 01:29:55,815
tie a rock on the loose end,
and throw it across to me.

1213
01:29:56,558 --> 01:29:58,151
- Okay?
"Okay

1214
01:30:06,443 --> 01:30:11,370
lam the log. lam the ravine.

1215
01:30:12,324 --> 01:30:14,201
I am scared.

1216
01:30:34,930 --> 01:30:36,728
- This isn't so bad.
- Mom!

1217
01:30:46,358 --> 01:30:47,359
Morn!

1218
01:30:48,944 --> 01:30:51,663
- Be careful, Hannah.
- I'm coming, Mom.

1219
01:30:51,738 --> 01:30:53,991
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.

1220
01:30:55,033 --> 01:30:56,706
- Concentrate.
- Go slower.

1221
01:30:56,785 --> 01:30:58,879
- Hannah, go back.
- No.

1222
01:30:58,954 --> 01:31:02,379
- I'm not gonna let you stay out here.
- Hannah!

1223
01:31:02,457 --> 01:31:06,928
- Mom, my foot's stuck.
- Good.

1224
01:31:07,003 --> 01:31:08,095
God.

1225
01:31:08,713 --> 01:31:12,092
Okay. Here I come.

1226
01:31:13,426 --> 01:31:16,054
- Stay right there.
- Hannah, try.

1227
01:31:17,389 --> 01:31:18,811
I'm coming.

1228
01:31:19,849 --> 01:31:22,648
- Does it hurt?
- No.

1229
01:31:22,727 --> 01:31:24,980
Okay, let's push.

1230
01:31:27,399 --> 01:31:30,573
Push hard. Don't lose your balance.

1231
01:31:30,652 --> 01:31:32,746
Okay, put your foot down.

1232
01:31:33,613 --> 01:31:35,741
Okay, I'm gonna turn around.
ls your foot all right?

1233
01:31:35,824 --> 01:31:37,701
- Yeah, it's okay.
- Okay, okay.

1234
01:31:37,784 --> 01:31:41,414
Don't look down. Here we go.

1235
01:31:42,664 --> 01:31:44,712
Take my hand, honey.

1236
01:31:47,627 --> 01:31:51,382
I distinctly remember telling you
to stay off this log.

1237
01:31:51,464 --> 01:31:53,307
Of course what do I know?
I'm just your mother.

1238
01:31:53,383 --> 01:31:57,433
- I'm sorry.
- Sure, easy to say that now, you're sorry.

1239
01:31:57,512 --> 01:32:00,436
But will you listen the next time?
I'd just like someone to listen.

1240
01:32:00,515 --> 01:32:03,439
Sometimes you're as stubborn as your father.

1241
01:32:04,561 --> 01:32:07,531
We did it! We did it! Honey.

1242
01:32:08,565 --> 01:32:10,033
Mom, you're a hero.

1243
01:32:10,108 --> 01:32:12,236
Wait, stop. It was nothing. It wasn't that bad.

1244
01:32:12,318 --> 01:32:15,618
It was awful. It was awful, but we made it.

1245
01:32:17,032 --> 01:32:20,252
Okay, go down to the bridge.
Go down to the bridge.

1246
01:32:21,536 --> 01:32:26,667
Damn. Those little bimbesses
are really starting to bug me.

1247
01:32:27,792 --> 01:32:31,592
All right, screw the flags, girls.
I know a shortcut.

1248
01:32:32,797 --> 01:32:35,550
Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on.

1249
01:32:38,136 --> 01:32:39,638
I don't know, Ms. Plendor.

1250
01:32:39,721 --> 01:32:42,691
The map says
this areas is for hunters and trappers only.

1251
01:32:42,766 --> 01:32:44,393
It might be dangerous.

1252
01:32:44,476 --> 01:32:47,855
It is only dangerous
when you don't know what you're doing.

1253
01:32:50,065 --> 01:32:51,567
Ankle!

1254
01:32:52,275 --> 01:32:54,277
This is unbelievable.

1255
01:32:54,360 --> 01:32:55,828
We haven't lost that much time.

1256
01:32:55,904 --> 01:32:58,248
- Really?
- Let me see the map.

1257
01:32:58,323 --> 01:32:59,870
Wouldn't it be bizarre if we won?

1258
01:32:59,949 --> 01:33:02,828
- Hey, we already won.
- What do you mean?

1259
01:33:03,661 --> 01:33:06,790
Well, we didn't quit, and we didn't cheat.

1260
01:33:06,873 --> 01:33:09,251
And we didn't call home
when we were in trouble.

1261
01:33:09,334 --> 01:33:12,964
- We were a team. We won.
- We did.

1262
01:33:13,046 --> 01:33:14,343
- You're right.
- Yeah.

1263
01:33:14,422 --> 01:33:16,800
Now let's beat those suckers
at their own game.

1264
01:33:16,883 --> 01:33:18,055
Yeah, let's go.

1265
01:33:19,427 --> 01:33:20,519
Hey!

1266
01:33:22,806 --> 01:33:27,152
It's broken.
Jamie, some rations and some water.

1267
01:33:28,269 --> 01:33:31,318
Come on, you're not gonna leave me here.

1268
01:33:31,397 --> 01:33:32,444
You're dead weight.

1269
01:33:32,524 --> 01:33:36,028
Besides, after we win,
we'll send someone back to get to you.

1270
01:33:36,111 --> 01:33:37,579
Come on, Red Feathers, move on.

1271
01:33:37,654 --> 01:33:42,626
Cleo, I was in labor with you for 17 hours!

1272
01:33:43,076 --> 01:33:45,454
I bought you your first...

1273
01:33:45,537 --> 01:33:49,792
I have patches, girls!
I can get you into West Point.

1274
01:33:50,542 --> 01:33:52,670
You little bitches!

1275
01:33:54,295 --> 01:33:56,514
Oh, my God, what was that?

1276
01:33:56,589 --> 01:33:59,092
Don't worry.
It was probably just one of nature's beasts.

1277
01:33:59,175 --> 01:34:05,273
Geek brain! I hate children! I hate them!

1278
01:34:06,224 --> 01:34:09,103
Yep, it's a beast, all right.

1279
01:34:10,895 --> 01:34:12,272
Move out.

1280
01:34:15,692 --> 01:34:17,194
Hey.

1281
01:34:18,027 --> 01:34:19,995
How bad is it, Tessa?

1282
01:34:20,071 --> 01:34:26,499
Well, there's multiple contusions
and possibly a cracked fibula.

1283
01:34:27,245 --> 01:34:29,543
And a severe personality disorder.

1284
01:34:33,585 --> 01:34:35,132
There's a nurse at the finish line.

1285
01:34:35,211 --> 01:34:38,055
What's the quickest way
we can get you there?

1286
01:34:38,131 --> 01:34:41,010
No. You don't want to help me.

1287
01:34:41,092 --> 01:34:45,438
You just want to know the quickest way
to get there so you can win.

1288
01:34:46,347 --> 01:34:49,100
Well, blow it out your barracks bag,
sweetheart.

1289
01:34:49,184 --> 01:34:52,438
You can leave me behind,
because I'm not talking.

1290
01:34:52,520 --> 01:34:53,897
Well, let's leave her.

1291
01:34:53,980 --> 01:34:56,108
We've already lost
a lot of time because of her.

1292
01:34:56,191 --> 01:34:58,193
Besides, she hates us.

1293
01:34:58,276 --> 01:35:00,574
Why should we lose just to help her?

1294
01:35:01,321 --> 01:35:04,370
Well, it's a real moral dilemma, isn't it, girls?

1295
01:35:04,449 --> 01:35:07,919
We could help a fellow Wilderness Girl,

1296
01:35:07,994 --> 01:35:11,544
as we swore we would
when we pledged the Wilderness Promise.

1297
01:35:11,623 --> 01:35:13,045
That's right.

1298
01:35:13,124 --> 01:35:18,130
Or we could leave her here
and pursue our own personal glory.

1299
01:35:19,130 --> 01:35:22,100
While she is ravaged by vicious beasts,

1300
01:35:23,593 --> 01:35:27,143
toyed with by lonely mountain men.

1301
01:35:29,641 --> 01:35:31,188
Really lonely mountain men.

1302
01:35:33,394 --> 01:35:35,271
I leave it up to you.

1303
01:35:36,022 --> 01:35:37,444
Huddle.

1304
01:35:42,111 --> 01:35:44,955
I think we should leave her. She's just a pain.

1305
01:35:45,031 --> 01:35:46,578
Go tell her.

1306
01:35:46,658 --> 01:35:50,208
Ms. Nefler, she's history. We're out of here.

1307
01:35:51,162 --> 01:35:52,630
Come on.

1308
01:35:55,250 --> 01:35:58,504
Come on, guys. We did swear.

1309
01:36:15,353 --> 01:36:18,698
I knew I could count on you girls
to do the right thing.

1310
01:36:18,773 --> 01:36:21,026
Stop, or I'll bust out crying.

1311
01:36:21,109 --> 01:36:24,113
I knew I could count on you losers
to do the wimpy thing.

1312
01:36:24,195 --> 01:36:26,072
You need your rest.

1313
01:36:27,031 --> 01:36:28,658
As the girls are clearing the woods,

1314
01:36:28,741 --> 01:36:31,494
I want a tight close-up on Tessa.
Stay with her.

1315
01:36:31,577 --> 01:36:33,705
Then we're gonna whip pan
through the rest of the woods.

1316
01:36:33,788 --> 01:36:36,587
Now the theme of the shot is victory.

1317
01:36:39,544 --> 01:36:40,716
I think I see somebody.

1318
01:36:40,795 --> 01:36:45,642
We're number one. We're number one.
We're number one. We're number one.

1319
01:36:45,717 --> 01:36:49,438
-It's the Red Feathers.
- Oh, dear.

1320
01:36:58,354 --> 01:37:03,781
Hearty congratulations to the winners
of our annual Wilderness Jamboree,

1321
01:37:03,860 --> 01:37:06,909
the Culver City Red Feathers.

1322
01:37:10,658 --> 01:37:12,251
Thank you, Mrs. Temple.

1323
01:37:12,327 --> 01:37:15,957
On behalf of the other Feathers and myself,
we felt good.

1324
01:37:16,039 --> 01:37:18,258
We were pumped.
We came to win, and we won.

1325
01:37:21,002 --> 01:37:25,007
I'd like to say that the other three troops
gave us a real run for our money,

1326
01:37:25,089 --> 01:37:27,183
but they didn't.

1327
01:37:27,258 --> 01:37:30,011
Wait a minute, dear. Wait.
Where's your mother?

1328
01:37:30,094 --> 01:37:32,392
I don't know. Give me the trophy.

1329
01:37:32,472 --> 01:37:35,567
Dear, the rules specifically state

1330
01:37:35,641 --> 01:37:40,272
that the trophy goes to the first entire troop
to cross the finish line.

1331
01:37:40,355 --> 01:37:41,902
No leader, no trophy.

1332
01:37:41,981 --> 01:37:43,608
Give me the trophy.

1333
01:37:43,691 --> 01:37:45,819
Get your footing, girls,
going down the hill please.

1334
01:37:45,902 --> 01:37:47,028
Look.

1335
01:37:47,612 --> 01:37:48,659
Come on, Jamie.

1336
01:37:53,409 --> 01:37:56,458
Look, they're dragging something.

1337
01:37:57,497 --> 01:37:59,215
Looks like an animal.

1338
01:38:00,041 --> 01:38:01,588
Must be Velda.

1339
01:38:25,108 --> 01:38:26,280
<i>That's a cut.</i>

1340
01:38:27,318 --> 01:38:33,041
The Red Feathers came in without a leader,
therefore, they are disqualified.

1341
01:38:33,825 --> 01:38:37,921
And the winners are Troop Beverly Hills.

1342
01:38:42,500 --> 01:38:43,672
No!

1343
01:38:44,293 --> 01:38:46,045
We did it! We did it!

1344
01:38:46,838 --> 01:38:50,433
No, no, no, no, no way!

1345
01:38:50,508 --> 01:38:53,512
You're not even Wilderness Girls.
None of you are.

1346
01:38:53,594 --> 01:38:55,847
I'm the only real Wilderness Girl.

1347
01:38:56,639 --> 01:38:59,688
Does she strike you
as being minus a few buttons?

1348
01:39:00,351 --> 01:39:04,356
I'll tell you about the buttons,
you senile old bag.

1349
01:39:04,939 --> 01:39:07,943
I may be old, and I may be senile,

1350
01:39:08,025 --> 01:39:11,871
but the only thing
that's bagged around here is you.

1351
01:39:11,946 --> 01:39:13,619
You're fired.

1352
01:39:14,532 --> 01:39:18,833
Fine. I really care. So what? Who cares?

1353
01:39:18,911 --> 01:39:21,289
I don't need you. I don't need anybody.

1354
01:39:21,372 --> 01:39:23,841
I'm gonna secede
from the national organization.

1355
01:39:23,916 --> 01:39:25,509
Yeah, that's it. I'll secede,

1356
01:39:25,585 --> 01:39:29,306
and I'll form my own organization,
yeah, Plendor's Pilgrims.

1357
01:39:29,380 --> 01:39:30,973
That's it, Plendor's Pilgrims.

1358
01:39:31,048 --> 01:39:33,801
No, wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Plendor's Pioneers.

1359
01:39:33,885 --> 01:39:35,353
How's that? That's perfect.

1360
01:39:35,428 --> 01:39:38,728
What about Velda's Avengers?

1361
01:39:39,098 --> 01:39:41,647
I'm sorry to see you go.

1362
01:39:41,726 --> 01:39:44,479
She was always fun at our Halloween party.

1363
01:39:46,230 --> 01:39:49,200
And I'm sorry we don't have a trophy for you.

1364
01:39:50,067 --> 01:39:53,162
Well, we don't need a trophy, huh?

1365
01:39:53,237 --> 01:39:57,617
Yeah, I mean, all we wanted to do
was to prove we were real Wilderness Girls.

1366
01:39:58,159 --> 01:40:01,083
Well, who ever said you weren't?

1367
01:40:01,496 --> 01:40:02,748
Velda.

1368
01:40:24,769 --> 01:40:26,612
I wish Dad were here.

1369
01:40:27,939 --> 01:40:31,068
I know. Me too.

1370
01:40:38,866 --> 01:40:44,168
You did it. I am so proud of you.
I knew you could do it. You were great.

1371
01:40:44,247 --> 01:40:45,749
Mom did it.

1372
01:40:52,588 --> 01:40:54,306
May I kiss the Troop Leader?

1373
01:40:57,260 --> 01:40:58,762
It's okay with me.

1374
01:41:12,024 --> 01:41:13,822
I'm sorry, Phyl.

1375
01:41:14,819 --> 01:41:17,823
- I love you, Wilderness Girl.
- Fred.

1376
01:41:20,616 --> 01:41:23,836
I love you, Muffler Man.

1377
01:41:25,121 --> 01:41:27,499
It's about time you two grew up.

1378
01:41:32,712 --> 01:41:35,340
- Well, we should get married.
- Again.

1379
01:41:37,174 --> 01:41:39,302
Five, six, seven, eight.

1380
01:41:39,385 --> 01:41:41,479
<i>We're the girls from Beverly Hills</i>

1381
01:41:41,554 --> 01:41:43,147
One, two, three, four.

1382
01:41:43,222 --> 01:41:45,691
<i>Shopping was our greatest skill</i>

1383
01:41:45,766 --> 01:41:47,609
Five, six, seven, eight.

1384
01:41:47,685 --> 01:41:49,904
<i>After all is said and done</i>

1385
01:41:49,979 --> 01:41:51,947
One, two, three, four.

1386
01:41:52,023 --> 01:41:54,117
<i>Beverly Hills is number one</i>

1387
01:41:54,191 --> 01:41:56,068
Five, six, seven, eight.

1388
01:41:56,152 --> 01:41:59,998
<i>Beverly Hills, what a thrill
Beverly Hills, what a thrill</i>

1389
01:42:00,072 --> 01:42:04,327
<i>Beverly Hills, what a thrill
Beverly Hills, what a thrill</i>

1390
