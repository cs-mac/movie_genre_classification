1
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,075
Good to go?

2
00:01:55,116 --> 00:01:56,116
Mandy Lane.

3
00:01:59,533 --> 00:02:02,200
- Hi.
- Someone got fucking hot this summer!

4
00:02:02,325 --> 00:02:05,450
- Thank you.
- Shut up, faggot.

5
00:02:06,783 --> 00:02:07,866
Hey, Mandy.

6
00:02:10,283 --> 00:02:13,491
- Hey, why don't you come with us?
- Jake, there's no room.

7
00:02:13,616 --> 00:02:16,283
There's plenty of room.

8
00:02:16,991 --> 00:02:19,658
- Where are you guys going?
- My place.

9
00:02:19,783 --> 00:02:21,991
Little pool party.

10
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,325
Sure, we'll go.

11
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:26,991
Who's "we"?

12
00:02:27,116 --> 00:02:30,741
- Yeah, who's "we"?
- You and me.

13
00:02:32,408 --> 00:02:33,866
Sweet.

14
00:03:07,575 --> 00:03:09,991
Open up, man!

15
00:03:36,408 --> 00:03:40,283
What, no bathing suit? That sucks.

16
00:03:40,408 --> 00:03:42,283
No big deal.

17
00:03:45,075 --> 00:03:46,908
Just go in your underwear.

18
00:03:48,908 --> 00:03:52,116
You have no idea how hot you are,
do you?

19
00:03:53,825 --> 00:03:56,075
No. This is cute.

20
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:59,116
- I like this. What is this?
- Stop!

21
00:03:59,241 --> 00:04:01,283
Come on, don't be shy about it.

22
00:04:02,366 --> 00:04:03,700
Strip right here.

23
00:04:04,741 --> 00:04:07,325
Let everyone see what colour
those panties are.

24
00:04:11,158 --> 00:04:12,866
What the fuck?

25
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,200
Fucking dick!

26
00:04:19,325 --> 00:04:20,783
Dude!

27
00:04:20,908 --> 00:04:22,741
Laugh now, you fucking dick!

28
00:04:23,783 --> 00:04:25,075
Dylan, stop.

29
00:04:30,616 --> 00:04:33,575
Mandy, I was just playing around
with this kid.

30
00:04:34,616 --> 00:04:38,283
Mandy, no... He saved my life, man.
This guy, he's amazing.

31
00:04:38,408 --> 00:04:41,283
He's a winner.
You're fucking amazing, you know that?

32
00:04:41,408 --> 00:04:44,325
- So you're OK?
- I'm fine.

33
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:45,616
Fine.

34
00:04:58,283 --> 00:04:59,908
Easy, easy.

35
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:02,283
I come in peace.

36
00:05:03,366 --> 00:05:06,283
What, she won't talk to you now?

37
00:05:08,783 --> 00:05:10,700
- That figures.
- Look...

38
00:05:13,283 --> 00:05:17,241
Let's just play nice and be friends
and get the fuck off my roof.

39
00:05:18,783 --> 00:05:20,283
OK?

40
00:05:37,908 --> 00:05:39,824
So how are you gonna do it?

41
00:05:42,533 --> 00:05:43,991
Do what?

42
00:05:45,574 --> 00:05:47,324
Seal the deal.

43
00:05:48,783 --> 00:05:50,449
I mean, look. Look down there.

44
00:05:51,241 --> 00:05:54,033
Every stupid fucking idiot
has the exact same goal.

45
00:05:54,158 --> 00:05:56,158
What makes you any different?

46
00:05:56,283 --> 00:05:58,574
I don't need to be different.

47
00:06:00,616 --> 00:06:02,741
Jesus, are you fucking listening to me?

48
00:06:02,866 --> 00:06:04,408
I know her.

49
00:06:04,533 --> 00:06:08,824
She's not gonna fall for some jock
who tried to drown her best friend.

50
00:06:08,949 --> 00:06:11,449
Face it, man, you're boring.

51
00:06:11,574 --> 00:06:14,783
You're a fucking marshmallow,
like an American Idol...

52
00:06:14,908 --> 00:06:17,824
Get off my fucking roof, Emmet.

53
00:06:22,116 --> 00:06:24,699
- This went well.
- What are you doing?

54
00:06:29,574 --> 00:06:30,991
- Careful, man.
- Look.

55
00:06:32,741 --> 00:06:34,949
She's looking at us right now.

56
00:06:35,074 --> 00:06:37,783
Waiting to see what you do.

57
00:06:40,658 --> 00:06:41,949
Well?

58
00:06:45,658 --> 00:06:47,408
It's not that far.

59
00:06:47,533 --> 00:06:50,658
You've fucking done this before, right?

60
00:06:52,408 --> 00:06:53,658
She'll love it.

61
00:06:53,783 --> 00:06:56,366
She... I promise.

62
00:07:03,074 --> 00:07:05,949
You know what?
Fuck it, you're too drunk.

63
00:07:06,074 --> 00:07:07,866
Don't!

64
00:07:07,991 --> 00:07:12,074
Don't tell me I'm too fucking drunk
in my own fucking house.

65
00:07:13,658 --> 00:07:15,116
I'll do it with you, then.

66
00:07:17,116 --> 00:07:18,116
Come on!

67
00:07:20,866 --> 00:07:23,033
Let's jump for Mandy.

68
00:07:23,158 --> 00:07:25,199
See if she can catch us.

69
00:07:25,324 --> 00:07:27,491
Dylan, get down from there.

70
00:07:27,616 --> 00:07:29,699
You, too, you fucking loser.

71
00:07:31,574 --> 00:07:32,908
Ready?

72
00:07:34,824 --> 00:07:35,866
One.

73
00:07:40,741 --> 00:07:42,283
Two.

74
00:07:46,783 --> 00:07:48,324
Three.

75
00:07:48,449 --> 00:07:50,366
Mandy Lane!

76
00:08:04,699 --> 00:08:08,283
Somebody get help!

77
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:27,658
Oh, no!

78
00:08:32,408 --> 00:08:34,116
Hey, you stupid fuck!

79
00:08:34,241 --> 00:08:36,699
Look what you made him do!

80
00:08:38,574 --> 00:08:40,616
What the hell just happened?

81
00:08:47,824 --> 00:08:49,657
Better than all the rest!

82
00:09:10,366 --> 00:09:12,199
There she is, boys.

83
00:09:12,324 --> 00:09:13,866
Mandy Lane.

84
00:09:14,907 --> 00:09:16,032
Untouched.

85
00:09:17,032 --> 00:09:18,199
Pure.

86
00:09:19,116 --> 00:09:22,241
Since the dawn of junior year,
men have tried to possess her,

87
00:09:22,366 --> 00:09:25,782
and to date, all have failed.

88
00:09:27,574 --> 00:09:31,324
Some have even died
in their reckless pursuit of this angel.

89
00:09:32,116 --> 00:09:35,449
I've invited her out to my ranch
this weekend.

90
00:09:35,574 --> 00:09:37,032
My kingdom.

91
00:09:37,157 --> 00:09:40,407
So I ask you, gentlemen,
am I the shit?

92
00:09:41,657 --> 00:09:44,741
To which I reply, yes, I am.

93
00:09:47,366 --> 00:09:48,866
But will she come?

94
00:09:56,574 --> 00:09:57,616
Hi.

95
00:10:06,532 --> 00:10:09,366
Chloe! Chloe, listen.

96
00:10:09,491 --> 00:10:11,491
- Fuck off, Red.
- Is she in?

97
00:10:11,616 --> 00:10:13,741
I'm working on it.

98
00:10:13,866 --> 00:10:16,157
Let's water up!

99
00:10:23,532 --> 00:10:24,824
What's up, man?

100
00:10:24,949 --> 00:10:27,991
She better come, dude.

101
00:10:28,949 --> 00:10:30,532
She'll be there.

102
00:10:30,657 --> 00:10:32,241
And I got first dibs.

103
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:35,407
Yeah, we'll see about that.

104
00:10:35,532 --> 00:10:37,366
I can see your nipples.

105
00:10:38,949 --> 00:10:40,116
Obviously.

106
00:10:42,282 --> 00:10:46,116
- How do you get 'em that hard?
- It's a secret.

107
00:10:47,491 --> 00:10:49,449
You go, Mandy Lane!

108
00:11:13,616 --> 00:11:15,366
Mandy!

109
00:11:17,116 --> 00:11:18,782
Finished it.

110
00:11:19,866 --> 00:11:21,282
Not now, Emmet.

111
00:11:21,407 --> 00:11:25,907
Um, Mandy's, like, busy.
She doesn't have time for love poems.

112
00:11:26,866 --> 00:11:30,199
Creepy boy.
Can't he take a fucking hint?

113
00:11:30,324 --> 00:11:33,366
Not friend any more.

114
00:11:36,241 --> 00:11:38,657
Go jump off a roof, Emmet.

115
00:11:45,324 --> 00:11:47,907
Check out what I just got.

116
00:11:48,032 --> 00:11:49,491
Is it contagious?

117
00:11:49,616 --> 00:11:52,491
Does it explain that thing
on your face?

118
00:11:54,491 --> 00:11:59,116
Whatever,
smarty-cunt. Seriously, check it out.

119
00:11:59,241 --> 00:12:01,116
Tasty, huh?

120
00:12:01,241 --> 00:12:04,116
Marlin, don't get me wrong,
but you're all pudge.

121
00:12:04,241 --> 00:12:06,574
That thing's gonna get lost
in the folds.

122
00:12:08,782 --> 00:12:10,532
I'm not fat.

123
00:12:11,324 --> 00:12:12,574
OK.

124
00:12:12,699 --> 00:12:14,532
I think it's nice, Marlin.

125
00:12:17,449 --> 00:12:20,782
Hey! You're coming this weekend,
right?

126
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:23,615
- Right.
- You OKed it with your aunt?

127
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:26,074
- I will.
- Well, you'd better.

128
00:12:26,199 --> 00:12:28,574
You only finish junior year once.

129
00:12:34,532 --> 00:12:35,824
Shit, dude!

130
00:12:35,949 --> 00:12:37,907
She's coming.

131
00:12:39,032 --> 00:12:41,574
She's coming to my ranch, dude!

132
00:12:42,532 --> 00:12:45,407
Hey, Jake?

133
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:48,740
I got first dibs though.

134
00:12:54,074 --> 00:12:58,574
No, you don't!
Say it again, man. Say it again.

135
00:12:58,699 --> 00:13:02,324
I don't need to say it again.
I only say things once.

136
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:04,365
Emmet's not going, is he?

137
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:06,449
No.

138
00:13:06,574 --> 00:13:08,032
Bird's going.

139
00:13:09,324 --> 00:13:12,157
Hold on! How many boys are going?

140
00:13:12,282 --> 00:13:14,574
Aunt Jo, I can take care of myself.

141
00:13:14,699 --> 00:13:16,699
- I know.
- These people invited me.

142
00:13:16,824 --> 00:13:20,824
New friends. Don't you think
I should make new friends?

143
00:13:20,949 --> 00:13:23,074
Wouldn't that be, like, good for me?

144
00:13:23,199 --> 00:13:26,365
It is good to see you playing
with this new crowd.

145
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:29,532
- They seem very mature.
- They are.

146
00:13:29,657 --> 00:13:33,157
And... And responsible and normal.

147
00:13:33,282 --> 00:13:38,324
Just give her permission, Mother.
It seems to be going in that direction.

148
00:13:39,574 --> 00:13:41,699
My parents would let me go.

149
00:13:43,449 --> 00:13:45,490
- OK.
- Thanks.

150
00:13:46,532 --> 00:13:48,115
But be careful.

151
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,199
I will, I will. Thank you, Aunt Jo.

152
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:02,740
Would you like to hit this? Would you?

153
00:15:02,865 --> 00:15:04,865
What's with all these marks?

154
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:07,990
Jake's hooked up with a girl
from each of those states.

155
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:10,490
There's, like, 40 states in California.

156
00:15:10,615 --> 00:15:12,699
42.

157
00:15:12,824 --> 00:15:15,949
And the fucker's parents
are taking him to Alaska in August.

158
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:19,032
So who gets it this weekend?

159
00:15:19,157 --> 00:15:20,699
Chloe.

160
00:15:20,824 --> 00:15:22,407
And Mandy.

161
00:15:22,532 --> 00:15:24,282
Yeah, right.

162
00:15:24,407 --> 00:15:26,282
At the same time.

163
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:30,532
Has Jake said anything about
getting back together with me?

164
00:15:30,657 --> 00:15:32,907
Not that I can think of.

165
00:15:33,032 --> 00:15:35,824
Would you even tell me if he did?

166
00:15:35,949 --> 00:15:36,990
No, ma'am.

167
00:15:37,115 --> 00:15:38,865
Damn it!

168
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:41,282
I am trying to fuck your best friend
here.

169
00:15:41,407 --> 00:15:43,615
- Give me a little cooperation.
- Alright.

170
00:16:58,157 --> 00:17:01,282
Hey, man, Check this out.

171
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:04,990
- Oh, shit!
- Whiteout on three?

172
00:17:05,115 --> 00:17:08,448
- Let's do it.
- Yeah, fucking blue 42 and shit.

173
00:17:08,573 --> 00:17:11,573
Yeah, let's do it.

174
00:17:15,823 --> 00:17:18,157
Excuse me?

175
00:17:18,282 --> 00:17:19,823
- Sir?
- Yeah?

176
00:17:19,948 --> 00:17:23,823
Can I get some directions? You know
your way around here pretty good?

177
00:17:23,948 --> 00:17:26,615
Is this a map? I know some things.

178
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:29,032
We're looking for the 305.

179
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:41,157
- You want some?
- No, thanks.

180
00:17:42,198 --> 00:17:45,282
Thank God for little brothers with ADD.

181
00:17:45,407 --> 00:17:46,907
How's that working out?

182
00:17:47,032 --> 00:17:50,073
- Has his behaviour improved?
- Whatever.

183
00:17:58,865 --> 00:18:01,448
Dude, you gotta trim that thing!

184
00:18:04,365 --> 00:18:06,032
Fucking Sherwood Forest!

185
00:18:11,323 --> 00:18:14,282
Well, here's 71.

186
00:18:14,407 --> 00:18:16,323
I don't know the 305.

187
00:18:16,448 --> 00:18:18,448
- Never heard of it?
- No.

188
00:18:18,573 --> 00:18:21,115
This is where we are, right here.

189
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,448
Alright.

190
00:18:22,573 --> 00:18:25,948
But I don't see it on here, son.
I just don't see it.

191
00:18:26,073 --> 00:18:29,198
Well, thanks for trying, man.
We'll, uh...

192
00:18:29,323 --> 00:18:31,365
- Good luck to you, man.
- Thanks a lot.

193
00:18:34,907 --> 00:18:41,490
Now, those are some mighty
fine-looking ladies. Yeah, they are!

194
00:18:41,615 --> 00:18:43,615
Alright, man.

195
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:45,698
Thanks, asshole.

196
00:18:50,323 --> 00:18:52,240
- Hey!
- Shit!

197
00:19:00,407 --> 00:19:02,698
Man, did y'all see Lane?

198
00:19:02,823 --> 00:19:06,407
She was, like, a pro
with the getaway vehicle.

199
00:19:06,532 --> 00:19:08,948
Let's rob a bank, huh?

200
00:19:09,073 --> 00:19:11,198
You totally corrupted her, Jake.

201
00:20:10,656 --> 00:20:12,656
What the hell's going on back there?

202
00:20:12,781 --> 00:20:16,615
There is no fucking way
I am taking my car in there.

203
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:19,573
My dad will kill me if I scratch it.

204
00:20:19,698 --> 00:20:23,365
It's cool.
There's room in here. Sit on laps.

205
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:25,781
Uh, I'd like to walk.

206
00:20:25,906 --> 00:20:28,906
You guys are not walking.
It's another mile to the ranch.

207
00:20:29,031 --> 00:20:30,156
Are you kidding?

208
00:20:30,281 --> 00:20:32,615
Fuck that. I am not walking.

209
00:20:35,073 --> 00:20:36,406
OK.

210
00:20:36,531 --> 00:20:37,573
I'm game.

211
00:20:37,698 --> 00:20:41,115
I'll send the ranch hand
back down for y'all.

212
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:45,115
And there won't be much time
for walking,

213
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:49,073
or, uh... anything else, Bird.

214
00:21:06,448 --> 00:21:09,406
I guess they'll be talking
when we get back.

215
00:21:09,531 --> 00:21:10,823
Talking?

216
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,656
About us.

217
00:21:16,823 --> 00:21:19,323
You know we're all trying
to get you, right?

218
00:21:21,365 --> 00:21:22,906
Get me?

219
00:21:24,115 --> 00:21:25,656
Get with you.

220
00:21:27,948 --> 00:21:29,948
Look, here's the deal.

221
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:33,448
I'm not like the other guys.

222
00:21:33,573 --> 00:21:34,990
I mean, I love 'em.

223
00:21:35,115 --> 00:21:39,990
They're my boys an' all,
but... I'm just not like them.

224
00:21:40,115 --> 00:21:42,198
I have respect for the woman.

225
00:21:44,906 --> 00:21:46,781
I can see that.

226
00:21:49,198 --> 00:21:51,240
Can I hold your hand?

227
00:22:03,573 --> 00:22:05,240
Can I kiss you?

228
00:22:09,281 --> 00:22:10,823
It's just a kiss.

229
00:22:31,448 --> 00:22:33,906
Hey. Don't mean to disturb y'all,

230
00:22:34,031 --> 00:22:37,448
but Red asked me to circle round
and bring you up to the house.

231
00:22:39,198 --> 00:22:40,823
I'm Garth.

232
00:22:41,615 --> 00:22:42,781
Mandy Lane.

233
00:22:47,864 --> 00:22:50,114
And I think we should get going.

234
00:22:50,239 --> 00:22:51,823
Alright, hop in.

235
00:22:56,656 --> 00:22:57,948
Hold on.

236
00:23:06,656 --> 00:23:07,823
Pull!

237
00:23:22,823 --> 00:23:24,239
Thanks.

238
00:23:27,198 --> 00:23:30,531
Welcome to paradise, dudes! Yeah!

239
00:23:34,989 --> 00:23:36,864
Hi, Mandy.

240
00:23:48,781 --> 00:23:50,156
Don't worry.

241
00:23:50,281 --> 00:23:52,614
I'm not planning on sleeping in here.

242
00:23:52,739 --> 00:23:54,781
- You're not?
- Please!

243
00:23:54,906 --> 00:23:58,531
I'm gonna sleep in a room
with a boy in it, thank you.

244
00:23:58,656 --> 00:24:01,989
Maybe go visit Garth,
the cowboy babe.

245
00:24:02,114 --> 00:24:03,448
The ranch hand?

246
00:24:03,573 --> 00:24:06,864
Like you didn't notice.

247
00:24:06,989 --> 00:24:09,073
This useless piece of shit!

248
00:24:09,198 --> 00:24:12,989
Let's go.
It's time to get you ladies wet.

249
00:24:14,906 --> 00:24:16,906
Meet us at the lake.

250
00:24:18,489 --> 00:24:22,323
- Sure you don't want company?
- Like you could keep up.

251
00:25:02,448 --> 00:25:03,614
You bitch!

252
00:25:16,406 --> 00:25:18,573
- Nice, nice, nice!
- Mandy!

253
00:25:18,698 --> 00:25:21,531
Come on in, the water's good.

254
00:25:21,656 --> 00:25:22,989
Get in!

255
00:25:29,989 --> 00:25:31,114
Shit!

256
00:25:55,073 --> 00:25:56,448
Jesus.

257
00:26:07,323 --> 00:26:08,614
Damn!

258
00:26:10,864 --> 00:26:13,198
Oh, my! I'm gonna say it, man!

259
00:26:13,323 --> 00:26:15,781
Mandy, I love you!
I love everything about you.

260
00:26:15,906 --> 00:26:18,906
Your aunt and your cousin Jen.

261
00:26:20,697 --> 00:26:22,114
Come here, baby.

262
00:26:22,947 --> 00:26:25,031
- Come here, baby.
- I love it.

263
00:26:25,156 --> 00:26:26,531
Jake!

264
00:26:28,989 --> 00:26:30,406
He got it!

265
00:26:31,989 --> 00:26:34,197
- Give 'em to me!
- And she's naked.

266
00:26:35,281 --> 00:26:37,697
Jake! Damn it!

267
00:26:39,906 --> 00:26:42,197
Jake! Jake! No!

268
00:26:59,947 --> 00:27:01,697
Shit!

269
00:27:01,822 --> 00:27:03,156
Nice shot, man.

270
00:27:03,281 --> 00:27:04,447
Jesus!

271
00:27:04,572 --> 00:27:09,031
Throw a few rocks before you go
swimming. Give the snakes fair warning.

272
00:27:09,156 --> 00:27:12,489
Good Lord, Garth! Goddamn!

273
00:27:15,864 --> 00:27:17,364
Thanks, dude.

274
00:27:18,489 --> 00:27:19,614
Thank you.

275
00:27:25,947 --> 00:27:28,739
Now I could really use a drink.

276
00:27:34,406 --> 00:27:35,614
Thank you.

277
00:27:45,906 --> 00:27:46,989
We got an ace.

278
00:27:47,114 --> 00:27:48,406
Waterfall!

279
00:28:07,572 --> 00:28:09,281
It's your turn, Red.

280
00:28:09,406 --> 00:28:10,656
Thank you.

281
00:28:12,281 --> 00:28:14,239
Truth or dare?

282
00:28:15,614 --> 00:28:16,864
Truth or dare?

283
00:28:16,989 --> 00:28:18,281
Dare.

284
00:28:18,406 --> 00:28:23,239
Go out to the barn
and, uh... suck off the horse.

285
00:28:24,864 --> 00:28:27,031
You are such a sick little fuck.

286
00:28:27,156 --> 00:28:31,697
We agreed an R rating, remember?
That's triple X. That's creepy.

287
00:28:31,822 --> 00:28:33,072
You're drunk!

288
00:28:33,197 --> 00:28:35,239
I get to go.

289
00:28:35,364 --> 00:28:37,114
Truth or dare?

290
00:28:37,239 --> 00:28:40,072
Mandy?

291
00:28:41,447 --> 00:28:43,072
Mandy?

292
00:28:44,114 --> 00:28:45,572
Truth or dare?

293
00:28:46,489 --> 00:28:48,572
- Dare.
- Yeah!

294
00:28:48,697 --> 00:28:51,406
Go outside and invite Garth
to join us.

295
00:28:51,531 --> 00:28:53,697
- What? No. Don't.
- Why?

296
00:28:53,822 --> 00:28:55,156
Do!

297
00:28:55,281 --> 00:28:56,781
OK.

298
00:28:58,031 --> 00:29:00,614
What? No, stop that!
He could...

299
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:04,781
Seriously, don't sneak up on him
or anything. He might shoot you.

300
00:29:04,906 --> 00:29:06,906
I think I'll be OK.

301
00:29:36,447 --> 00:29:37,864
Garth?

302
00:29:39,031 --> 00:29:40,322
Hey, Garth?

303
00:29:47,614 --> 00:29:48,697
Garth?

304
00:29:48,822 --> 00:29:50,530
You in there?

305
00:29:54,530 --> 00:29:56,739
- You looking for me?
- No.

306
00:29:58,072 --> 00:30:00,405
Yeah. Um...

307
00:30:01,822 --> 00:30:04,405
I was just... getting some air.

308
00:30:05,864 --> 00:30:08,239
Wondering if you, you know...

309
00:30:10,155 --> 00:30:11,697
...wanted some.

310
00:30:11,822 --> 00:30:13,447
Air?

311
00:30:14,947 --> 00:30:17,364
Uh... company.

312
00:30:17,489 --> 00:30:18,905
Actually...

313
00:30:20,114 --> 00:30:24,072
...they kind of dared me to come out here
and invite you in for a drink.

314
00:30:26,572 --> 00:30:28,239
Uh...

315
00:30:31,697 --> 00:30:33,280
So you wanna come?

316
00:30:36,947 --> 00:30:39,947
I do, but... I can't.

317
00:30:40,905 --> 00:30:44,072
I don't think Red's father
would approve.

318
00:30:44,197 --> 00:30:45,447
Yeah.

319
00:30:48,697 --> 00:30:51,114
It's silly that we're all inside.

320
00:30:51,239 --> 00:30:54,655
Well, they all seem to be
doing alright in there.

321
00:31:02,989 --> 00:31:04,322
Well...

322
00:31:04,447 --> 00:31:07,072
- Sure you don't wanna come in?
- Pretty sure.

323
00:31:10,572 --> 00:31:13,405
Well, um... OK.

324
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:14,530
Bye.

325
00:31:16,655 --> 00:31:20,155
Red, who told you it was cool
to wear shorts and cowboy boots?

326
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:23,864
Marlin, have you ever had
a lesbian experience?

327
00:31:23,989 --> 00:31:26,822
When was the last time
you jerked off?

328
00:31:26,947 --> 00:31:29,780
Have you ever seen
your dad's wiener?

329
00:31:29,905 --> 00:31:32,155
Is it true what they
say about black guys?

330
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,739
I don't know. Is it?

331
00:31:33,864 --> 00:31:35,739
Your dad's gay, right?

332
00:31:36,655 --> 00:31:38,947
When are you gonna give up
that cherry?

333
00:31:39,072 --> 00:31:42,405
- When are you gonna give up yours?
- Ooh!

334
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:43,614
Spit or swallow?

335
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:51,280
Who has the smallest pecker
in the room?

336
00:31:51,405 --> 00:31:54,655
Who does have the smallest package
in the room?

337
00:31:58,572 --> 00:32:00,405
What?

338
00:32:02,822 --> 00:32:03,864
Sorry, Jake.

339
00:32:05,530 --> 00:32:07,739
Sorry!

340
00:32:07,864 --> 00:32:11,072
- What the fuck are you laughing at?
- It's just a joke.

341
00:32:11,197 --> 00:32:14,405
Come on, man, take it easy.
Have another drink.

342
00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:18,447
- Why don't we take a break, guys?
- No! We're just getting started.

343
00:32:18,572 --> 00:32:21,739
Not a big deal, dude.
Not a big deal. Chill.

344
00:32:21,864 --> 00:32:24,447
Really, it's... not a big deal.

345
00:32:27,155 --> 00:32:29,405
Know what? Fuck you guys.

346
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:32,697
- Jake...
- Let him go. What do you care?

347
00:32:32,822 --> 00:32:34,364
You don't know when to quit.

348
00:32:35,530 --> 00:32:37,030
Blow me, chubs.

349
00:32:37,155 --> 00:32:39,614
Fuck you!

350
00:32:39,739 --> 00:32:43,447
What the fuck? You whore!

351
00:32:45,405 --> 00:32:47,405
What the fuck does she care?

352
00:32:51,822 --> 00:32:53,489
Oh, my God.

353
00:32:53,614 --> 00:32:56,405
She's totally in love with Jake.

354
00:33:04,655 --> 00:33:05,989
Jake?

355
00:33:11,655 --> 00:33:13,363
Come on, Jake.

356
00:33:15,363 --> 00:33:17,447
I didn't mean it was small.

357
00:33:17,572 --> 00:33:20,655
I just meant
it was the smallest one at the table.

358
00:33:43,405 --> 00:33:44,822
Jake?

359
00:33:54,488 --> 00:33:57,822
C'mon, Jake. It was just a joke.

360
00:34:02,238 --> 00:34:04,613
- There you are. You OK?
- That was bullshit.

361
00:34:04,738 --> 00:34:08,613
- Poor baby...
- No, don't "poor baby" me.

362
00:34:10,988 --> 00:34:12,780
Let me see if I can help.

363
00:34:12,905 --> 00:34:15,572
You've helped enough. Stop it, Marlin!

364
00:34:38,947 --> 00:34:42,863
See? It gets big when it gets hard.

365
00:34:42,988 --> 00:34:45,822
They all get big when they get hard.

366
00:34:57,822 --> 00:34:59,030
Assholes!

367
00:35:25,655 --> 00:35:26,655
Shit!

368
00:35:34,405 --> 00:35:36,738
- Better?
- Oh, yeah.

369
00:35:38,613 --> 00:35:39,822
My turn.

370
00:35:39,947 --> 00:35:41,822
Let's go finish the game.

371
00:35:41,947 --> 00:35:44,822
Wait. Jake,
you're gonna go down on me, right?

372
00:35:44,947 --> 00:35:47,447
Uh-uh.

373
00:35:47,572 --> 00:35:49,947
Why don't you go get Red to do you?

374
00:35:52,113 --> 00:35:55,447
I am sick and tired
of you fucking little boys.

375
00:35:57,072 --> 00:36:01,280
I'm gonna go fuck the cowboy, Jake!
You fucking little prick!

376
00:36:02,488 --> 00:36:07,238
Come on, Jake. It's dark in here.
I can't see.

377
00:36:09,322 --> 00:36:10,947
Jake, come on.

378
00:36:16,697 --> 00:36:17,738
Jake?

379
00:36:20,488 --> 00:36:22,738
Come on, it's not funny any more.

380
00:37:42,321 --> 00:37:45,155
Nobody say shit about his cock.

381
00:37:51,905 --> 00:37:53,821
Where's Marlin?

382
00:37:53,946 --> 00:37:56,655
She mentioned something
about fucking the maid.

383
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:59,363
Ranch hand, dude.

384
00:37:59,488 --> 00:38:00,655
Whatever.

385
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:38,655
Will y'all get me a beer?

386
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:40,280
- No.
- No.

387
00:38:49,196 --> 00:38:51,988
Fine. Anybody else want a beer?

388
00:38:52,113 --> 00:38:54,571
- No, thanks.
- Alright.

389
00:39:05,863 --> 00:39:07,530
Ah, shit!

390
00:39:08,571 --> 00:39:09,696
Perfect.

391
00:39:15,530 --> 00:39:16,655
Perfect.

392
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:20,821
Jake, go get Garth
to start the genny, OK?

393
00:39:20,946 --> 00:39:22,030
Hell, no.

394
00:39:22,155 --> 00:39:24,530
I just got you a beer.

395
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:29,946
- Probably busy boning Marlin anyway.
- Somebody help me!

396
00:39:30,905 --> 00:39:33,613
- Dude, go help Chloe.
- No way, bro.

397
00:39:34,988 --> 00:39:37,863
Someone should go outside
and sort the generator.

398
00:39:46,071 --> 00:39:49,613
- Fuck it, I'll do it.
- I'm serious!

399
00:39:50,696 --> 00:39:52,863
I'll go help Chloe.

400
00:39:58,946 --> 00:40:01,446
Um, I should go get the candles.

401
00:41:03,821 --> 00:41:05,654
So where is everyone?

402
00:41:07,029 --> 00:41:08,779
They're all fucking.

403
00:41:10,196 --> 00:41:11,613
Really?

404
00:41:11,738 --> 00:41:14,071
And just where are you, Mandy Lane?

405
00:41:15,154 --> 00:41:17,279
Right here.

406
00:41:49,029 --> 00:41:51,779
What are you doing?

407
00:41:51,904 --> 00:41:55,196
Oh, uh, trying to get the power
back on.

408
00:41:55,321 --> 00:41:56,821
Right.

409
00:42:00,071 --> 00:42:01,904
Red check the fuse box?

410
00:42:02,029 --> 00:42:04,196
I think I can get it started.

411
00:42:06,571 --> 00:42:08,613
Don't you have a girlfriend in there?

412
00:42:08,738 --> 00:42:11,404
Yeah, I think I might.

413
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:13,863
Well, I'd run back in there
before I lose her.

414
00:42:13,988 --> 00:42:15,904
What the hell are you talking about?

415
00:42:16,029 --> 00:42:21,113
We're on the grid here. Power ain't
got nothing to do with the generator.

416
00:42:29,363 --> 00:42:31,113
Those little fuckers.

417
00:42:32,904 --> 00:42:35,238
Hope they get the power
turned back on.

418
00:42:36,071 --> 00:42:38,696
Yeah, I wouldn't count on it.

419
00:42:43,029 --> 00:42:46,113
Yeah, I thought we could use
some alone time.

420
00:42:46,238 --> 00:42:47,363
Jake.

421
00:42:47,488 --> 00:42:48,696
What?

422
00:42:54,279 --> 00:42:56,446
- What are you doing?
- Nothing!

423
00:43:00,863 --> 00:43:03,196
You know what?

424
00:43:03,321 --> 00:43:06,654
You walk around this place
like you think you're better than us.

425
00:43:06,779 --> 00:43:10,446
- I do not think I'm better...
- And you know what? You're not.

426
00:43:10,571 --> 00:43:14,738
Shit! I think we're pretty much
on the same page here, don't you?

427
00:43:14,863 --> 00:43:19,238
In fact, Lane,
I think we're a lot alike.

428
00:43:19,363 --> 00:43:20,821
You want what I want.

429
00:43:21,654 --> 00:43:23,404
Turn the power back on, Jake.

430
00:43:25,238 --> 00:43:27,279
Why the fuck did you come here anyway?

431
00:43:30,154 --> 00:43:31,696
Good question.

432
00:43:39,488 --> 00:43:44,071
Hey, look, I understand you.
I really do.

433
00:43:44,196 --> 00:43:48,029
- Don't forget that shit.
- I don't have a problem with Marlin.

434
00:43:49,196 --> 00:43:52,446
But if that fat bitch
has a better chance at Jake than I do,

435
00:43:52,571 --> 00:43:55,737
then why is it my fault
that she has body-image issues?

436
00:43:55,862 --> 00:43:58,112
Like, that's her problem, you know?

437
00:43:58,237 --> 00:44:03,779
She makes a choice to be fat,
so it's totally all on her, you know?

438
00:44:04,862 --> 00:44:07,737
It's like... what does that
have to do with me?

439
00:44:07,862 --> 00:44:10,987
What does that have to do with Jake,
you know?

440
00:44:11,112 --> 00:44:12,321
It's like...

441
00:44:14,029 --> 00:44:15,737
You know what I mean?

442
00:44:17,029 --> 00:44:19,404
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

443
00:44:29,029 --> 00:44:30,154
You OK?

444
00:44:30,279 --> 00:44:33,446
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

445
00:44:33,571 --> 00:44:35,404
Yeah, she's fine.

446
00:44:35,529 --> 00:44:37,321
And I'm bored.

447
00:44:37,446 --> 00:44:39,487
Messing with the fuse box wasn't fun?

448
00:44:39,612 --> 00:44:43,654
Oh, no. No, that was fun.
It was fun, wasn't it, Mandy?

449
00:44:45,446 --> 00:44:47,404
Thanks for starting up the genny.

450
00:44:47,529 --> 00:44:49,487
Fuck you!

451
00:44:49,612 --> 00:44:53,654
Come on, Bird. We were just playing
with you, man. We cool?

452
00:44:55,321 --> 00:44:57,029
OK.

453
00:44:57,154 --> 00:45:01,071
Hey, Chloe, how about a swim?
Skinny-dip.

454
00:45:01,196 --> 00:45:04,196
Just you, me
and the beautiful creature again.

455
00:45:05,696 --> 00:45:09,987
I'm sorry, um... didn't you,
like, fuck Marlin tonight?

456
00:45:11,071 --> 00:45:13,529
I did, actually. Lane?

457
00:45:14,946 --> 00:45:17,154
Last chance to get a piece.

458
00:45:18,196 --> 00:45:20,362
Well, back to the well, then.

459
00:45:21,529 --> 00:45:23,362
No. No, no, no, no. No keys.

460
00:45:23,487 --> 00:45:25,404
Jake, you can't drive.

461
00:45:25,529 --> 00:45:27,612
- Jake, please!
- Don't wait up, ladies!

462
00:45:27,737 --> 00:45:32,821
Hilarious! Give me the fucking keys!
Jake, give me the fucking gun, dude!

463
00:45:41,487 --> 00:45:42,904
Marlin!

464
00:45:46,029 --> 00:45:48,612
Where you at, you crazy bitch?

465
00:45:58,029 --> 00:45:59,112
Marlin!

466
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:06,154
What the fuck?

467
00:47:20,945 --> 00:47:23,112
That you, babe?

468
00:47:28,820 --> 00:47:31,654
Hey! What are you doing?

469
00:47:37,779 --> 00:47:39,862
Are you crying or puking?

470
00:47:43,737 --> 00:47:46,279
Not that it makes much difference
to me, but...

471
00:47:47,445 --> 00:47:49,654
Nah, I'm just playing with you.

472
00:47:49,779 --> 00:47:50,945
Here,

473
00:47:51,070 --> 00:47:52,945
have a drink.

474
00:47:53,070 --> 00:47:55,779
Don't give me the silent treatment.
Have a drink.

475
00:47:55,904 --> 00:47:57,695
It'll make you feel better.

476
00:47:57,820 --> 00:47:59,279
C'mon, baby, have a drink.

477
00:48:01,487 --> 00:48:02,654
Come on, have a drink.

478
00:48:05,112 --> 00:48:06,320
Oh, shit!

479
00:48:11,779 --> 00:48:13,654
Who the fuck?

480
00:49:06,404 --> 00:49:09,279
Wait, wait, wait.
Did you guys hear that?

481
00:49:09,404 --> 00:49:11,112
It's just Jake messing around.

482
00:49:11,237 --> 00:49:15,445
No, no, no. He's drunk
and he's in a truck and he's got a gun.

483
00:49:15,570 --> 00:49:17,029
OK, that's bad.

484
00:49:17,154 --> 00:49:19,029
Shit!

485
00:49:19,154 --> 00:49:20,945
- Bird, go get him.
- Fuck that.

486
00:49:21,070 --> 00:49:23,904
I'm not doing it.
He's been an asshole all night.

487
00:49:25,862 --> 00:49:28,820
Don't look at me!
I'm not going out there to get shot.

488
00:49:28,945 --> 00:49:30,904
Yeah, just let him cool off.

489
00:49:31,904 --> 00:49:35,987
Oh, my God! OK, fine.
I will go get him myself.

490
00:49:36,112 --> 00:49:37,529
Damn it!

491
00:49:48,404 --> 00:49:53,904
I heard a gunshot.
What the hell's going on here, Red?

492
00:50:26,279 --> 00:50:29,445
Look, I don't care
what you do. I really don't.

493
00:50:29,570 --> 00:50:34,195
But if you're drinking and whatever,
I don't wanna know, right?

494
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:36,070
I don't need to know.

495
00:50:36,195 --> 00:50:38,987
- It's not us.
- But no guns.

496
00:50:39,112 --> 00:50:41,029
You're the one with the gun.

497
00:50:42,987 --> 00:50:46,570
You've been drinking a lot and doing
a lot of whatever you're doing,

498
00:50:46,695 --> 00:50:49,612
so I'd suggest
you call it a night, alright?

499
00:50:50,487 --> 00:50:53,445
- Take it, man. We're done.
- I'm not gonna take it, Red.

500
00:50:53,570 --> 00:50:58,112
Just sit tight and wait till
the morning. We'll have a big time then.

501
00:50:58,237 --> 00:51:01,362
I would feel much safer
if you were here.

502
00:51:01,487 --> 00:51:04,320
Well, I'm leaving, darling.

503
00:51:05,278 --> 00:51:08,695
Oh, and, uh...
if I hear one more gunshot,

504
00:51:08,820 --> 00:51:10,862
I'm calling your dad.

505
00:51:51,570 --> 00:51:53,153
Lane? Lane?

506
00:52:02,820 --> 00:52:04,862
Is he single?

507
00:52:06,112 --> 00:52:08,653
Why the sudden interest
in the ranch hand?

508
00:52:08,778 --> 00:52:12,487
Just curious, that's all.

509
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:17,028
So, well, is he?

510
00:52:17,153 --> 00:52:19,278
Well...

511
00:52:19,403 --> 00:52:23,945
Well, he was married and then
his... his wife died tragically.

512
00:52:24,070 --> 00:52:27,778
Oh, my God. That poor thing.

513
00:52:29,112 --> 00:52:30,820
He's poor alright.

514
00:52:30,945 --> 00:52:33,612
I bet your mom likes him.

515
00:52:33,737 --> 00:52:36,987
Yeah. Both my parents like him.

516
00:52:37,112 --> 00:52:39,695
They love having a marine
around the house.

517
00:52:39,820 --> 00:52:42,237
Oh, my God.

518
00:52:42,362 --> 00:52:46,612
A cowboy and a soldier?
I just got wet.

519
00:52:46,737 --> 00:52:49,695
You know, Ned Willis
was trying to recruit me.

520
00:52:50,778 --> 00:52:55,070
I think he got traumatised by the
Gulf War. He saw a lot of people die.

521
00:52:55,195 --> 00:52:58,653
- He doesn't seem traumatised.
- Nah, he's just like that.

522
00:52:58,778 --> 00:53:02,070
The guy's seriously traumatised.
Classic shell shock.

523
00:53:02,195 --> 00:53:04,987
Oh, my God. Can I just go hug him?

524
00:53:05,112 --> 00:53:08,570
That is so sad. So sad.

525
00:53:28,570 --> 00:53:33,653
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, oh, my God!
I just saw somebody covered in blood!

526
00:53:33,778 --> 00:53:37,403
You put so much shit up your nose,
I don't believe a word you say.

527
00:53:37,528 --> 00:53:39,612
No, I mean it. I just saw somebody!

528
00:53:39,737 --> 00:53:43,570
- Hey, Chloe, it's been a long night.
- I swear to God, I saw someone.

529
00:53:43,695 --> 00:53:46,820
There's nobody out there.
There's nobody for miles.

530
00:53:46,945 --> 00:53:48,362
Look, I'll prove it.

531
00:53:48,487 --> 00:53:51,070
- No! Red!
- I'm gonna prove it to you.

532
00:54:03,945 --> 00:54:06,445
There's nobody.

533
00:54:10,237 --> 00:54:12,736
Fuck! Get down, get down, get down!

534
00:54:14,028 --> 00:54:16,486
There's no one out there.

535
00:54:20,778 --> 00:54:23,986
Chloe? Chloe, are you OK?

536
00:54:24,945 --> 00:54:28,070
- Yeah.
- I think we're all just real tired.

537
00:54:31,445 --> 00:54:33,320
I'm fine.

538
00:54:35,653 --> 00:54:38,111
You OK?

539
00:54:38,236 --> 00:54:40,695
- I'm fucked.
- Sit down.

540
00:54:47,778 --> 00:54:50,028
I have to go to the bathroom.

541
00:54:51,820 --> 00:54:54,070
I don't want to go by myself.

542
00:54:55,028 --> 00:54:58,736
OK. OK, let's go. Yeah?

543
00:54:58,861 --> 00:55:00,903
OK, I got you.

544
00:55:38,361 --> 00:55:40,403
Where's the light?

545
00:55:47,070 --> 00:55:50,278
OK, girl. Yeah? You're safe?

546
00:55:51,695 --> 00:55:54,320
You'll be fine. You're calm.

547
00:55:54,445 --> 00:55:57,028
Right?

548
00:55:57,153 --> 00:56:01,361
- Like a monk.
- Yeah, right.

549
00:56:07,736 --> 00:56:09,778
Thank God.

550
00:56:24,153 --> 00:56:25,778
Yeah? See?

551
00:56:25,903 --> 00:56:27,903
You're gonna be fine.

552
00:56:30,111 --> 00:56:31,736
Thanks.

553
00:56:38,903 --> 00:56:42,820
Your hands are shaking. Are you OK?

554
00:56:42,945 --> 00:56:44,986
Yeah. I'm fine.

555
00:56:48,195 --> 00:56:50,945
Jake and Bird both tried to kiss me.

556
00:56:52,111 --> 00:56:54,153
They did?

557
00:56:58,570 --> 00:57:03,611
- You're so much prettier than me.
- Chloe...

558
00:57:03,736 --> 00:57:06,111
No.

559
00:57:06,236 --> 00:57:08,445
You are. It's fine.

560
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:16,820
This will make you calm.

561
00:57:16,945 --> 00:57:18,653
Open up.

562
00:57:18,778 --> 00:57:20,278
- No, no.
- Yeah.

563
00:57:21,195 --> 00:57:23,236
Now swallow.

564
00:57:25,986 --> 00:57:28,028
Swallow.

565
00:57:45,653 --> 00:57:49,944
Hi. We got a little impatient. Sorry.

566
00:57:58,778 --> 00:58:00,819
That's nice.

567
00:58:02,736 --> 00:58:05,819
- You good?
- I'm fading.

568
00:58:07,944 --> 00:58:11,153
We should all crash,
at least for a couple of hours.

569
00:58:11,278 --> 00:58:13,944
Yeah. Jake and Marlin
can find their way home.

570
00:58:14,069 --> 00:58:18,736
Yeah. Probably asleep already,
cuddled up under some juniper bush.

571
00:58:21,278 --> 00:58:23,319
Y'all want to go inside?

572
00:58:24,653 --> 00:58:27,694
There's plenty of beds.
We can all, uh...

573
00:58:27,819 --> 00:58:31,903
I'm not gonna make suggestions.
It'd be weird to make suggestions.

574
00:58:32,028 --> 00:58:34,319
We'll figure something out.

575
00:58:36,111 --> 00:58:39,236
Here he is.

576
00:58:40,444 --> 00:58:43,569
OK. He's gonna want attention.
Just ignore him.

577
00:58:43,694 --> 00:58:45,361
Don't fucking indulge him.

578
00:58:47,028 --> 00:58:48,819
Hey, jackass!

579
00:58:53,028 --> 00:58:56,111
Oh! Fuck you, man! What's going on?

580
00:59:00,653 --> 00:59:02,694
Fuck this shit.

581
00:59:03,694 --> 00:59:08,444
- Bird! Bird, come back here!
- You fucking bastard!

582
00:59:11,778 --> 00:59:13,819
Bird!

583
00:59:16,278 --> 00:59:18,653
Garth, listen, I'll straighten this out.

584
00:59:18,778 --> 00:59:21,028
Man, Garth. Please, dude.
Dude, please.

585
00:59:21,153 --> 00:59:23,319
OK, now I am begging you. I implore you.

586
00:59:23,444 --> 00:59:26,736
Please do not pick up the phone.
Don't call my dad. Do not...

587
00:59:26,861 --> 00:59:32,278
Please, I take full responsibility.
Nothing burned. We're OK, we're fine.

588
00:59:32,403 --> 00:59:34,778
Garth... Please.

589
00:59:40,486 --> 00:59:42,403
You rock. Thank God.

590
00:59:42,528 --> 00:59:45,861
Dude, you can... go back to sleep.

591
00:59:45,986 --> 00:59:48,028
I'm not going anywhere, buddy.

592
00:59:48,653 --> 00:59:50,486
OK, dude, but, you know...

593
00:59:53,153 --> 00:59:55,194
Hey, Jake!

594
00:59:58,278 --> 01:00:00,319
Jake, man, you need to chill.

595
01:00:01,611 --> 01:00:03,861
Hey, Bird. Hop in.

596
01:00:03,986 --> 01:00:07,819
Emmet? Now, what the fuck
are you doing here?

597
01:00:07,944 --> 01:00:11,569
Get in the truck.

598
01:00:12,819 --> 01:00:15,236
What, you gonna shoot me?

599
01:00:25,486 --> 01:00:29,111
- What the fuck is wrong with you?
- She having fun in there?

600
01:00:29,236 --> 01:00:31,903
- What's going on in there? Is it fun?
- Answer me!

601
01:00:32,028 --> 01:00:34,778
I saw you try and kiss her today,
out on the road.

602
01:00:34,903 --> 01:00:37,694
- What are you talking about?
- What did she taste like?

603
01:00:45,903 --> 01:00:50,236
- Where the fuck is Jake and Marlin?
- Doesn't matter.

604
01:00:51,319 --> 01:00:53,778
I'm not even here right now.

605
01:00:53,903 --> 01:00:56,028
I'll be dead in the morning.

606
01:00:56,153 --> 01:00:59,403
And you, you won't even
fucking make it that far.

607
01:00:59,528 --> 01:01:01,319
You're just like all the rest.

608
01:01:01,444 --> 01:01:04,153
Rest of who, man? Who's dead?

609
01:01:04,278 --> 01:01:06,819
You're not listening!

610
01:01:06,944 --> 01:01:08,736
Everyone.

611
01:01:14,527 --> 01:01:18,944
Over here. What's the matter, Bird?
Where you going, buddy?

612
01:01:22,819 --> 01:01:25,694
Oh, Birdy, Birdy, Birdy, Birdy.

613
01:01:29,819 --> 01:01:31,861
Where am I?

614
01:01:33,861 --> 01:01:35,902
I'm over here.

615
01:01:37,152 --> 01:01:39,111
Can't you see?

616
01:01:51,402 --> 01:01:53,444
I'm sorry, Bird.

617
01:01:57,486 --> 01:01:59,527
No, I'm not.

618
01:02:03,736 --> 01:02:07,361
About 40 head.
Most of them had real bad lesions

619
01:02:07,486 --> 01:02:09,777
and a lot were dropping calves.

620
01:02:09,902 --> 01:02:12,486
What happened to them?

621
01:02:12,611 --> 01:02:15,319
My dad had to sell 'em
to the neighbour.

622
01:02:19,402 --> 01:02:24,444
Your dad didn't sell the herd, Red.
You can't sell 'em when they're sick.

623
01:02:24,569 --> 01:02:26,902
So what did you do to 'em?

624
01:02:27,027 --> 01:02:31,111
Well, it's the only thing
that you can do. I put 'em down.

625
01:02:32,694 --> 01:02:36,277
- Well, my dad said...
- He said to take care of 'em and I did.

626
01:02:40,111 --> 01:02:41,361
Single-handedly.

627
01:02:41,486 --> 01:02:43,569
Leave it alone, Red.

628
01:02:43,694 --> 01:02:45,819
You shot them.

629
01:02:46,444 --> 01:02:48,444
Yeah. I shot 'em.

630
01:02:49,694 --> 01:02:52,361
Well, I just admire you, so...

631
01:02:55,111 --> 01:02:58,277
Will you protect us from the bandits?

632
01:02:59,361 --> 01:03:01,277
Yeah, I'll do that.

633
01:03:01,402 --> 01:03:04,902
- How about teenage boys?
- Yeah, them, too.

634
01:04:08,777 --> 01:04:10,569
- You OK?
- Yeah.

635
01:04:11,527 --> 01:04:14,861
Chloe gave me this... pill.

636
01:04:17,361 --> 01:04:19,402
Made me really tired.

637
01:04:23,611 --> 01:04:26,819
God, I can't sleep.
Don't let me fall asleep.

638
01:04:26,944 --> 01:04:28,986
Coffee will help.

639
01:04:37,069 --> 01:04:39,319
It's an odd group of friends.

640
01:04:39,444 --> 01:04:41,485
Yeah.

641
01:04:42,652 --> 01:04:46,610
You seem... I don't know. Different.

642
01:04:49,152 --> 01:04:51,569
It's cos I am.

643
01:04:58,069 --> 01:05:00,444
My parents died when I was little.

644
01:05:01,777 --> 01:05:03,777
Sorry to hear that.

645
01:05:04,860 --> 01:05:07,444
Somebody did a good job raising you.

646
01:05:07,569 --> 01:05:10,152
My aunt.

647
01:05:10,277 --> 01:05:11,902
She took me in.

648
01:05:13,902 --> 01:05:17,652
Wouldn't have a sister, say,
about ten years older, would you?

649
01:05:17,777 --> 01:05:19,027
Cousin Jen.

650
01:05:20,277 --> 01:05:22,527
She's 21.

651
01:05:24,319 --> 01:05:26,652
She'd do a number
on a nice man like you.

652
01:05:39,944 --> 01:05:42,194
I don't think they're coming back.

653
01:06:21,527 --> 01:06:25,360
Hi.
You've reached Robert, Nora, Emmet...

654
01:06:49,444 --> 01:06:51,860
They killed. They started to kill.

655
01:06:51,985 --> 01:06:55,944
Now, what's going to happen here
in a matter of few minutes is that...

656
01:07:30,860 --> 01:07:34,652
... being so bewildered with
many, many pressures on my brain,

657
01:07:34,777 --> 01:07:38,902
seeing all these people behave
so treasonous. It was too much for me.

658
01:07:52,277 --> 01:07:54,860
You OK?

659
01:08:06,652 --> 01:08:07,944
Mandy?

660
01:08:11,985 --> 01:08:14,277
I think we need to get out of here.

661
01:08:21,652 --> 01:08:24,985
Hey. We need to get up, OK?

662
01:08:25,110 --> 01:08:27,443
What's going on?
You guys are scaring me.

663
01:08:35,943 --> 01:08:37,943
Garth, Garth!

664
01:08:43,193 --> 01:08:45,943
- Where did you get hit?
- I got hit here.

665
01:08:46,068 --> 01:08:47,402
It's OK.

666
01:08:47,527 --> 01:08:50,235
Chloe, we're gonna get out of this, OK?

667
01:08:50,360 --> 01:08:54,443
- We're so fucked.
- It's dead.

668
01:09:03,027 --> 01:09:05,027
Somebody's out there!

669
01:09:05,152 --> 01:09:06,693
- Who?
- I don't know.

670
01:09:06,818 --> 01:09:10,902
- I need to get you all to a car.
- I'm not leaving you alone.

671
01:09:11,027 --> 01:09:13,152
I'll go.

672
01:09:13,277 --> 01:09:15,735
Look, I brought us here.
I'll get us out.

673
01:09:15,860 --> 01:09:19,360
Do you think they're OK?
Jake and Bird?

674
01:09:19,485 --> 01:09:21,068
And Marlin?

675
01:09:21,193 --> 01:09:23,568
Go. Out the back. Go.

676
01:09:24,693 --> 01:09:26,610
Go.

677
01:09:27,485 --> 01:09:29,943
Wait! I'll go with you.

678
01:10:05,068 --> 01:10:07,110
Let me see this.

679
01:10:18,902 --> 01:10:22,860
- Come on.
- Go on. I can't!

680
01:10:22,985 --> 01:10:26,402
Come on. Let's go. Stick together.

681
01:10:26,527 --> 01:10:28,902
I can't breathe any more.

682
01:10:33,902 --> 01:10:35,943
Oh, God!

683
01:10:48,235 --> 01:10:52,027
- Listen to me. Let's go!
- Just leave me here!

684
01:10:52,152 --> 01:10:53,985
Chloe! Listen, we'll walk.

685
01:10:54,110 --> 01:10:56,360
But they're waiting!

686
01:11:04,193 --> 01:11:06,568
Thank God!

687
01:11:06,693 --> 01:11:08,735
It's totally OK.

688
01:11:52,276 --> 01:11:53,901
No!

689
01:11:55,651 --> 01:11:57,651
Get up!

690
01:11:57,776 --> 01:12:00,235
Oh! Get up!

691
01:12:03,568 --> 01:12:05,610
Please get up. Get up!

692
01:12:11,610 --> 01:12:13,610
Please.

693
01:12:31,568 --> 01:12:34,985
In my cabin, the keys to the Jeep. Go.

694
01:13:01,860 --> 01:13:03,901
Oh, God!

695
01:13:27,443 --> 01:13:30,693
Look at you go, Chloe!
You got nowhere to fucking go!

696
01:13:30,818 --> 01:13:33,485
Fucking freak! Fucking whore!

697
01:13:35,943 --> 01:13:37,985
Huh, bitch? Whoo-hoo!

698
01:14:39,901 --> 01:14:41,610
Oh, God!

699
01:15:38,068 --> 01:15:40,026
Mandy!

700
01:15:40,151 --> 01:15:42,401
Mandy!

701
01:15:42,526 --> 01:15:43,568
Chloe!

702
01:15:45,443 --> 01:15:47,818
Come here, Chloe! Chloe!

703
01:15:50,693 --> 01:15:52,526
Come here!

704
01:15:55,276 --> 01:15:57,859
- I'm here, I'm here. Shh.
- They're all dead.

705
01:16:02,443 --> 01:16:04,943
They're all dead.

706
01:16:05,068 --> 01:16:07,359
Hush. It'll be OK, it'll be OK.

707
01:16:58,068 --> 01:16:59,568
What took you so long?

708
01:17:02,484 --> 01:17:06,651
- Look how bloody you are.
- Yeah. It just keeps gushing.

709
01:17:11,276 --> 01:17:15,276
You OK?

710
01:17:15,401 --> 01:17:18,234
Yeah. OK.

711
01:17:23,693 --> 01:17:25,734
Brought presents.

712
01:17:32,693 --> 01:17:34,734
No, no. You keep it.

713
01:17:36,984 --> 01:17:38,693
It's good?

714
01:17:41,068 --> 01:17:42,401
Um...

715
01:17:44,359 --> 01:17:49,109
I put everything in here, you know,
for the copycats and the cops.

716
01:17:50,026 --> 01:17:52,068
I think they'll appreciate it.

717
01:17:54,734 --> 01:17:57,318
- Will you sign it for me?
- Don't make fun of it.

718
01:17:59,276 --> 01:18:02,484
Mandy, it's the only way
any of them will understand.

719
01:18:02,609 --> 01:18:04,651
Alright.

720
01:18:10,609 --> 01:18:12,651
I never read it, anyway.

721
01:18:17,693 --> 01:18:19,109
Can I keep this, too?

722
01:18:21,318 --> 01:18:22,984
All yours.

723
01:18:30,818 --> 01:18:32,859
So what now?

724
01:18:36,401 --> 01:18:37,818
I guess we do it.

725
01:18:43,609 --> 01:18:47,442
Um... I know we said
that we'd both take pills,

726
01:18:47,567 --> 01:18:51,942
but I think you should take the pills
and then shoot me in the heart.

727
01:18:53,651 --> 01:18:55,151
But do it a bunch of times

728
01:18:55,276 --> 01:18:58,067
cos they don't always die
the first time, like Jake.

729
01:18:59,734 --> 01:19:04,859
Oh, um, and just don't shoot my face
cos my mom would want an open casket.

730
01:19:04,984 --> 01:19:06,859
Emmet...

731
01:19:06,984 --> 01:19:11,609
Here. Give me your hand.
I have to watch you do it.

732
01:19:13,526 --> 01:19:17,692
I mean, I trust you, but, you know...

733
01:19:20,651 --> 01:19:23,192
It's OK.

734
01:19:23,317 --> 01:19:25,984
Don't be scared.

735
01:19:26,109 --> 01:19:28,317
It's just us now.

736
01:19:28,442 --> 01:19:30,484
I'm not scared.

737
01:19:33,192 --> 01:19:34,817
Are you?

738
01:19:34,942 --> 01:19:36,984
Take them.

739
01:19:52,442 --> 01:19:54,067
OK?

740
01:20:10,734 --> 01:20:13,359
That's why you did all of this, right?

741
01:20:16,067 --> 01:20:17,942
Is that what you wanted?

742
01:20:18,067 --> 01:20:20,109
I'm doing it for you.

743
01:20:23,276 --> 01:20:26,026
You should never do anything for me.

744
01:20:28,651 --> 01:20:31,192
Mandy, don't.

745
01:20:33,317 --> 01:20:36,901
Hey, we had a plan.
We're gonna die now.

746
01:20:38,067 --> 01:20:40,234
One of us will.

747
01:20:40,359 --> 01:20:42,984
Help! Garth!

748
01:20:43,109 --> 01:20:44,484
Help!

749
01:20:48,317 --> 01:20:51,526
Garth!

750
01:20:58,234 --> 01:21:00,484
No, no!

751
01:21:14,234 --> 01:21:16,234
Mandy!

752
01:21:18,484 --> 01:21:20,109
Mandy!

753
01:21:43,401 --> 01:21:45,234
- No!
- Stop it!

754
01:21:46,817 --> 01:21:50,776
- Not so fast.
- Faster than you.

755
01:21:50,901 --> 01:21:52,276
Why are you fucking with me?

756
01:21:52,401 --> 01:21:55,151
We did everything we wanted!
We're the only ones left!

757
01:22:01,109 --> 01:22:02,984
I love you.

758
01:22:03,109 --> 01:22:05,776
You fucking knew that!

759
01:22:05,901 --> 01:22:07,776
Let's just be friends.

760
01:22:10,775 --> 01:22:12,650
We're different.

761
01:22:12,775 --> 01:22:14,859
You said so!

762
01:22:14,984 --> 01:22:17,025
I did everything right!

763
01:22:23,609 --> 01:22:26,025
You fucking die with me. Die with me!

764
01:22:38,359 --> 01:22:40,984
Die with me.

765
01:22:41,109 --> 01:22:45,192
- Mandy, fucking die with me!
- Fuck you!

766
01:22:48,317 --> 01:22:49,567
Die with me!

767
01:22:57,234 --> 01:23:00,234
I think I'll finish high school first.

768
01:23:49,525 --> 01:23:51,567
Garth.

769
01:24:35,942 --> 01:24:39,984
You did it.

770
01:24:40,109 --> 01:24:43,150
You saved us.
