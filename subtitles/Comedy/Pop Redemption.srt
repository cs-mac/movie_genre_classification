1
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:32,252
Dead, dead, dead

2
00:01:32,418 --> 00:01:34,502
His spirit is dead

3
00:01:47,877 --> 00:01:50,210
- Stop!
- What?

4
00:01:50,543 --> 00:01:52,085
- What are you doing?
- The riff.

5
00:01:52,293 --> 00:01:54,377
My ass! That was a solo.

6
00:01:56,252 --> 00:01:59,252
- That a solo or not?
- Sort of an arpeggio.

7
00:01:59,418 --> 00:02:01,793
A solo is virtuosity,
and virtuosity is...

8
00:02:02,002 --> 00:02:03,918
- Contemptible.
- Virtuosity, yeah...

9
00:02:04,085 --> 00:02:06,210
Shut up. This piece is killer,

10
00:02:06,418 --> 00:02:07,543
but it sounds like a slow.

11
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:08,752
Take it from the top.

12
00:02:11,793 --> 00:02:14,585
All the way from the top.

13
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:18,918
I'm coming.

14
00:02:19,543 --> 00:02:22,793
It's 6 p.m.
I have to set up the tables.

15
00:02:23,002 --> 00:02:24,543
Shit! The babysitter!

16
00:02:25,168 --> 00:02:27,543
The tour's gonna be a nightmare.

17
00:02:28,002 --> 00:02:30,710
Did you talk to Yoyo?

18
00:02:31,502 --> 00:02:32,543
It's Yue-Yu.

19
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:35,210
You talk to her about Romania?

20
00:02:35,418 --> 00:02:37,543
I was waiting for confirmation.

21
00:02:37,752 --> 00:02:40,710
I can't confirm if we have no wheels.

22
00:02:40,918 --> 00:02:42,543
I'll talk to her.

23
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:47,627
I'm warning you...

24
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:50,252
Next fall, we practice Sundays

25
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:51,543
and Thursdays.

26
00:03:55,002 --> 00:03:58,293
Death to passion, death, death.

27
00:03:58,502 --> 00:04:01,960
Death to routine, to schmaltz,
to early mornings.

28
00:04:02,377 --> 00:04:06,168
Death to work, family, country.

29
00:04:06,793 --> 00:04:09,377
Death to comfort and good intentions.

30
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:12,960
Death to love.

31
00:04:14,752 --> 00:04:16,043
And through my voice

32
00:04:17,210 --> 00:04:19,293
may Death show its true face.

33
00:04:19,502 --> 00:04:21,043
Alexandre,

34
00:04:21,752 --> 00:04:23,543
I'm ready.

35
00:04:24,293 --> 00:04:25,543
I'm coming.

36
00:04:27,752 --> 00:04:28,960
Sleep tight.

37
00:04:30,002 --> 00:04:31,127
By the way,

38
00:04:31,585 --> 00:04:33,377
a man called for you.

39
00:04:34,752 --> 00:04:35,960
Who was it?

40
00:04:36,127 --> 00:04:37,377
I can't remember.

41
00:04:37,627 --> 00:04:38,585
What did he want?

42
00:04:43,377 --> 00:04:44,377
It's okay.

43
00:04:44,793 --> 00:04:46,043
He'll call back.

44
00:04:47,668 --> 00:04:49,543
Or else promise me something.

45
00:04:49,835 --> 00:04:52,085
Go off to camp with your pals.

46
00:04:52,252 --> 00:04:54,418
But when you get back, a haircut.

47
00:04:54,585 --> 00:04:55,543
What?

48
00:04:55,752 --> 00:04:58,210
My hair is my personality.

49
00:04:58,377 --> 00:04:59,960
- I won't touch it.
- Second...

50
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:02,502
Shit, there's more?

51
00:05:02,752 --> 00:05:05,460
Quit all this satanic rock nonsense.

52
00:05:05,627 --> 00:05:08,627
First, it's not nonsense.

53
00:05:08,793 --> 00:05:09,918
It's very real.

54
00:05:10,085 --> 00:05:12,418
Second, it's not satanic rock.

55
00:05:12,585 --> 00:05:15,252
It's Black Metal. Totally different.

56
00:05:15,543 --> 00:05:16,835
And third,

57
00:05:17,127 --> 00:05:18,377
I...

58
00:05:18,835 --> 00:05:19,877
It's not that easy.

59
00:05:20,085 --> 00:05:22,168
- You're scared of Alex.
- I am not.

60
00:05:22,335 --> 00:05:23,752
- You're scared of Alex.
- I am not!

61
00:05:23,918 --> 00:05:26,210
Stop that. I'm not a teenager!

62
00:05:26,377 --> 00:05:30,085
I run a business. I earn a living.
I keep this joint going.

63
00:05:30,252 --> 00:05:33,043
I'll get him in here
and tell him what's what.

64
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:36,960
Can I have a fork?

65
00:05:51,793 --> 00:05:54,543
I was just thinking, we could...

66
00:05:55,085 --> 00:05:55,918
Who is it?

67
00:05:56,085 --> 00:05:57,085
No one, it's Erik.

68
00:05:57,418 --> 00:05:58,585
Good evening.

69
00:05:59,127 --> 00:06:00,418
What do you want?

70
00:06:00,585 --> 00:06:04,085
It's Rita... the mother of a kid
I give guitar lessons to.

71
00:06:04,252 --> 00:06:07,502
She was sort of putting me up
and we were...

72
00:06:08,043 --> 00:06:10,918
We had a clash and...
Some monogamy crap.

73
00:06:12,418 --> 00:06:13,543
No more babes.

74
00:06:13,835 --> 00:06:15,793
I quit. I've had it.

75
00:06:16,002 --> 00:06:16,877
Got a dictionary?

76
00:06:19,793 --> 00:06:20,627
What mugs.

77
00:06:22,668 --> 00:06:25,585
On top of Romania
we might have a gig in Ukraine.

78
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:28,877
I get it...

79
00:06:29,502 --> 00:06:32,960
Did you know boor
isn't an animal?

80
00:06:34,085 --> 00:06:38,043
To obtain quality strawberries,
French producers use two systems...

81
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:40,877
Indoor and outdoor production.

82
00:06:41,043 --> 00:06:42,960
Plants are kept off the ground

83
00:06:43,127 --> 00:06:45,585
or planted in compost beds.

84
00:06:46,085 --> 00:06:50,460
All our strawberries
are protected by tunnels.

85
00:06:50,918 --> 00:06:52,168
Did it go okay?

86
00:06:54,085 --> 00:06:55,543
Sure, great.

87
00:06:56,543 --> 00:06:57,627
And the rehearsal?

88
00:06:58,502 --> 00:07:00,043
You know what?

89
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,043
I'm much happier with the kids

90
00:07:03,252 --> 00:07:05,502
than drinking and hammering my bass.

91
00:07:07,877 --> 00:07:09,127
Don't say that.

92
00:07:11,793 --> 00:07:13,210
What about the tour?

93
00:07:13,418 --> 00:07:14,543
It's nowhere.

94
00:07:16,377 --> 00:07:19,502
You've got as many lives
as you like, and more,

95
00:07:19,668 --> 00:07:21,668
even ones you don't want.

96
00:07:21,877 --> 00:07:23,585
HAPPY FU

97
00:07:23,752 --> 00:07:24,960
Is it a music problem?

98
00:07:26,002 --> 00:07:28,793
I still like Black Metal,
that's not the problem,

99
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,210
but to listen to, to relax.

100
00:07:31,377 --> 00:07:32,960
Like me.

101
00:07:33,543 --> 00:07:36,043
Anyway if I do it, it's for you.

102
00:07:37,002 --> 00:07:37,960
Really?

103
00:07:39,252 --> 00:07:40,627
With the restaurant...

104
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,002
For me, it's Michele.
All alone with the kids.

105
00:07:44,377 --> 00:07:46,418
Don't sweat it. I was gonna quit.

106
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:49,543
- No shit?
- Not at all.

107
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:53,002
I'm a Guitar Hero.
I haven't soloed in 15 years.

108
00:07:53,502 --> 00:07:54,377
I'm quitting, too.

109
00:07:54,585 --> 00:07:56,085
Me, too.

110
00:08:04,085 --> 00:08:06,918
Happy birthday, Rocky.

111
00:08:16,377 --> 00:08:17,835
Satan is with us, guys.

112
00:08:18,002 --> 00:08:19,377
You almost missed the cake.

113
00:08:19,543 --> 00:08:21,085
Let's open the gifts.

114
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:22,752
Come on, kids.

115
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:27,002
Hellfest called me. They want us.

116
00:08:27,252 --> 00:08:28,877
The Hellfest?

117
00:08:31,252 --> 00:08:32,960
Wait a minute... who... how...?

118
00:08:33,335 --> 00:08:36,168
A band cancelled. But so what?
It's a sign.

119
00:08:36,752 --> 00:08:38,293
You know who's headlining?

120
00:08:39,418 --> 00:08:40,252
Dozzy Cooper.

121
00:08:40,668 --> 00:08:42,210
Holy shit, Dozzy Cooper!

122
00:08:43,918 --> 00:08:45,002
We play Sunday.

123
00:08:45,627 --> 00:08:46,918
What do you mean?

124
00:08:47,335 --> 00:08:48,793
Hellfest is this Sunday?

125
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,210
I see you stay with it.

126
00:08:51,377 --> 00:08:54,168
They need a French Black Metal band.
There're scarce.

127
00:08:54,502 --> 00:08:56,002
It's too big for us.

128
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:57,835
You'll have to blast it like never.

129
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,335
Hellfest.

130
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:05,835
Hey]

131
00:09:06,585 --> 00:09:07,877
Who gave the kid a bayonet?

132
00:09:09,877 --> 00:09:12,335
It's real.
I scoured 20 antique shops.

133
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:13,918
It even killed Germans.

134
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:18,460
MY bayonet!

135
00:09:19,002 --> 00:09:21,627
For her meds,
Debridat 50 noon and night,

136
00:09:21,793 --> 00:09:24,835
Levothyrox 75 in the morning.

137
00:09:25,002 --> 00:09:27,585
And a glass of wine

138
00:09:27,752 --> 00:09:29,210
with every meal.

139
00:09:31,043 --> 00:09:33,335
I know, but she enjoys it.

140
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,168
First question, Francis:

141
00:09:37,002 --> 00:09:39,668
What for Karl Marx
was the opium of the masses?

142
00:09:39,835 --> 00:09:41,168
French pop.

143
00:09:41,335 --> 00:09:43,752
- Religion?
- Right you are.

144
00:10:17,043 --> 00:10:18,418
What are you doing?

145
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,335
Breaking it in.

146
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:24,668
It'll take years at this rate.

147
00:10:24,835 --> 00:10:26,960
I have a 5-year car loan
up my ass.

148
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:29,543
I'm not fucking it up
after two miles.

149
00:10:32,085 --> 00:10:35,668
How about some music?
This silence is killing me.

150
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:37,043
Put some on.

151
00:10:42,502 --> 00:10:44,502
I'll turn on the player.

152
00:10:46,293 --> 00:10:47,877
What's that?

153
00:10:48,335 --> 00:10:51,335
Sorry. That's Yue-Yu's.

154
00:10:51,877 --> 00:10:52,877
There.

155
00:10:56,377 --> 00:11:00,335
I hadn't seen the system. Not bad.
It must be out of the future.

156
00:11:00,502 --> 00:11:03,002
CD player.

157
00:11:03,168 --> 00:11:05,585
It even has shuffle mode.

158
00:11:05,752 --> 00:11:08,085
- Shuffle your ass and sit down.
- All right.

159
00:11:08,252 --> 00:11:11,418
Nobody changes the order of a CD,
is that clear?

160
00:11:11,793 --> 00:11:14,168
Imagine reading
and changing the page order.

161
00:11:14,335 --> 00:11:15,252
Well, I never read.

162
00:11:15,418 --> 00:11:17,960
Jerks like you
turn Metal into nonsense.

163
00:11:19,627 --> 00:11:20,752
Bass boost?

164
00:11:21,585 --> 00:11:23,668
Bass boost.

165
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:39,710
No more skulls, maces, fire balls.

166
00:11:39,918 --> 00:11:43,377
I kept it simple: Dead Stifs. Period.

167
00:11:46,335 --> 00:11:47,377
Cool.

168
00:11:48,585 --> 00:11:50,502
So we keep the spelling error?

169
00:11:52,627 --> 00:11:55,960
I also made a dragon version
for Asian audiences.

170
00:11:56,127 --> 00:11:58,793
Shoulda asked me.
It's the year of the Rabbit.

171
00:11:59,543 --> 00:12:02,960
I'm not sticking a rabbit
on a Black Metal t-shirt.

172
00:12:03,252 --> 00:12:07,252
Second: since you're nervous,
we won't go directly to Hellfest.

173
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:08,710
What?

174
00:12:08,877 --> 00:12:10,543
What's the game?

175
00:12:11,335 --> 00:12:14,168
We'll do a warm-up gig on the road

176
00:12:14,335 --> 00:12:16,127
just to bond the group.

177
00:12:16,293 --> 00:12:17,752
I wanted to see concerts.

178
00:12:18,043 --> 00:12:21,793
You're a tourist at heart
when you should be a demi-god.

179
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,377
We're this year's music scene.

180
00:12:57,752 --> 00:13:00,793
Have you pissed in your john lately?

181
00:13:01,085 --> 00:13:03,418
There's panpipe music!
That's fascist.

182
00:13:05,002 --> 00:13:06,293
The longer we wait, the harder.

183
00:13:06,793 --> 00:13:08,960
Same here when I gotta go.

184
00:13:09,168 --> 00:13:10,877
No, harder to say we quit.

185
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:15,710
So let's tell him.

186
00:13:16,377 --> 00:13:17,418
We have to.

187
00:13:24,043 --> 00:13:26,460
Let's make tracks.
I smashed his radio.

188
00:14:09,502 --> 00:14:10,960
You sure it's here?

189
00:14:13,043 --> 00:14:15,168
Did you tell them what we do?

190
00:14:15,502 --> 00:14:19,252
Guys, when you believe in your music,
you can play anywhere.

191
00:15:23,377 --> 00:15:24,210
Oh, my God.

192
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:26,543
Outrageous.

193
00:15:56,918 --> 00:15:58,043
What's that?

194
00:16:08,335 --> 00:16:09,627
Is there a problem?

195
00:16:11,668 --> 00:16:13,043
Good timing, Batman.

196
00:16:13,335 --> 00:16:14,210
Here.

197
00:16:14,377 --> 00:16:15,710
- What's that?
- The rental.

198
00:16:16,502 --> 00:16:20,085
Put it away and turn the sound
back on. We have to keep warm.

199
00:16:20,293 --> 00:16:23,043
That's sick stuff.
There's been a mixup.

200
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:24,085
Hold on.

201
00:16:24,252 --> 00:16:26,918
We had a deal.
I paid, we play, period.

202
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:29,377
Not if you scare customers away.

203
00:16:29,543 --> 00:16:30,627
I'm the customer.

204
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,543
Get out.

205
00:16:34,002 --> 00:16:36,168
Want me to wipe off your makeup?

206
00:16:36,752 --> 00:16:38,918
- Everything okay?
- Just great.

207
00:16:39,085 --> 00:16:41,793
- What's going on?
- The man loves what we do.

208
00:16:42,252 --> 00:16:43,293
What's that?

209
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:44,835
We got paid?

210
00:16:45,002 --> 00:16:47,502
Sure. It's for you.

211
00:16:48,335 --> 00:16:49,502
And this is for you.

212
00:16:49,668 --> 00:16:51,168
Do we continue?

213
00:16:51,335 --> 00:16:52,502
Gimme 5 minutes.

214
00:16:52,668 --> 00:16:54,668
Have a drink
while I settle something.

215
00:16:57,418 --> 00:16:58,460
Shit.

216
00:17:00,877 --> 00:17:01,835
There a problem?

217
00:17:04,002 --> 00:17:05,085
Get me my shotgun.

218
00:17:19,418 --> 00:17:21,793
Alex... we gotta tell you something.

219
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:24,127
Me too. I'm proud.

220
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:28,585
We've had some mythic concerts
but that one shoots to the Top Five.

221
00:17:29,752 --> 00:17:31,085
We played two minutes.

222
00:17:31,335 --> 00:17:32,918
Two brilliant minutes.

223
00:17:33,085 --> 00:17:35,502
Which that audience
is not about to forget.

224
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:37,460
That's for sure.

225
00:17:38,002 --> 00:17:39,293
See that blonde in the middle?

226
00:17:39,627 --> 00:17:41,043
The pharmacist?

227
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:43,543
How do you know she's a pharmacist?

228
00:17:43,877 --> 00:17:45,918
She looked like one.

229
00:17:53,043 --> 00:17:53,877
What faces!

230
00:17:54,043 --> 00:17:57,960
If we keep this spirit
we're gonna knock 'em dead.

231
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,710
But fix your squirters.

232
00:18:01,877 --> 00:18:05,002
No kidding. I almost fired myself.

233
00:18:08,585 --> 00:18:09,710
What were you going to say?

234
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:17,085
You sure this is the way
to the campground?

235
00:18:17,252 --> 00:18:19,252
Sure. Quit worrying.

236
00:18:21,293 --> 00:18:22,585
What was that?

237
00:18:25,835 --> 00:18:27,543
Is he stupid or what?

238
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:29,585
The guy from the Star Club!

239
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:37,043
He's sick!

240
00:18:38,252 --> 00:18:39,793
Why's he doing this?

241
00:18:41,835 --> 00:18:42,668
I don't know.

242
00:18:42,877 --> 00:18:46,210
Maybe because I pissed on his console
before leaving.

243
00:18:46,377 --> 00:18:47,418
What?

244
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:49,585
So much for his crappy music.

245
00:18:49,752 --> 00:18:52,960
Don't do stuff like that!

246
00:18:53,418 --> 00:18:56,210
Hicks are dangerous,
they're not civilized like us.

247
00:18:56,377 --> 00:18:58,418
It's okay. He's gone.

248
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:00,710
It's not okay.

249
00:19:02,085 --> 00:19:04,752
I'm sure he dented my fender.

250
00:19:05,418 --> 00:19:07,210
Yue-Yu is gonna kill me.

251
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:10,293
You can't see a fucking thing.

252
00:19:10,668 --> 00:19:11,585
You're a pain, Alex.

253
00:19:11,752 --> 00:19:13,418
We're not at war with the world.

254
00:19:13,585 --> 00:19:16,710
I'm just at war with assholes.

255
00:19:19,585 --> 00:19:21,918
Satan wrapped us in his black cape.

256
00:19:23,085 --> 00:19:24,543
Leave Satan out of this.

257
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:26,627
Leave Satan out of this!

258
00:19:41,668 --> 00:19:43,668
Since we're talking serious,

259
00:19:43,835 --> 00:19:45,460
about next fall...

260
00:19:45,627 --> 00:19:48,710
We've all been thinking,
we have to talk to you.

261
00:19:48,877 --> 00:19:51,002
What then? What about?

262
00:19:51,668 --> 00:19:54,002
- Thursdays? Is that it?
- Watch out!

263
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:57,918
He's fucking with us.

264
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:46,543
Shit!

265
00:20:48,002 --> 00:20:49,752
Call 911.

266
00:20:50,585 --> 00:20:51,793
He's dead.

267
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:57,793
Is he dead?

268
00:20:59,752 --> 00:21:01,252
I can't get a signal. Can you?

269
00:21:01,418 --> 00:21:03,252
- We're lost.
- I'll get mine.

270
00:21:03,418 --> 00:21:04,793
Shit, he's dead.

271
00:21:09,918 --> 00:21:10,752
Listen.

272
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:37,210
Stop, you asshole!

273
00:21:38,168 --> 00:21:39,752
There's been a mixup.

274
00:21:40,127 --> 00:21:41,668
We have to catch him.

275
00:21:42,168 --> 00:21:43,752
Tell him it's not our fault.

276
00:21:43,918 --> 00:21:45,710
We don't touch anything.

277
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:49,127
Touch what you want.
Even with a good lawyer...

278
00:21:50,377 --> 00:21:52,752
We'll do 6 months.

279
00:21:52,918 --> 00:21:53,793
What?

280
00:21:54,918 --> 00:21:57,377
I can't go to jail.
I have loans to pay.

281
00:21:59,335 --> 00:22:02,460
He tried to kill us.
It's not our fault.

282
00:22:02,627 --> 00:22:04,210
Tell that to the cops.

283
00:22:05,418 --> 00:22:08,460
He threatened him
in front of 20 witnesses.

284
00:22:09,252 --> 00:22:11,752
And don't forget, we have a record.

285
00:22:11,918 --> 00:22:13,502
Shit.

286
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,960
We were 15 years old.

287
00:22:17,127 --> 00:22:19,127
For two shovels-full!

288
00:22:19,293 --> 00:22:22,460
It was still desecration
of a cemetery.

289
00:22:24,293 --> 00:22:25,418
Meanie!

290
00:22:25,585 --> 00:22:27,460
Quit flipping out and listen.

291
00:22:27,877 --> 00:22:30,835
If we vanish without a trace
and shut off our phones,

292
00:22:31,002 --> 00:22:32,418
they can't know it was us.

293
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:34,418
"It was us?"

294
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:38,835
One: Our concert wasn't announced.
No one knows us.

295
00:22:39,002 --> 00:22:42,168
Two: I made all the calls
from the unemployment office.

296
00:22:42,335 --> 00:22:43,543
Three: if the driver

297
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:46,543
took our plate number,
I'll cut my balls off.

298
00:22:47,252 --> 00:22:48,835
SO what?

299
00:22:49,377 --> 00:22:50,668
We leave him here?

300
00:22:53,002 --> 00:22:55,377
Glory to Satan, prince of devils

301
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:58,710
Humbly your servants entrust to you

302
00:23:00,293 --> 00:23:01,877
This emcee of nightly revels

303
00:23:02,043 --> 00:23:03,752
What are you talking about?

304
00:23:16,127 --> 00:23:18,460
- What is it?
- No acceleration.

305
00:23:21,418 --> 00:23:23,252
Something stuck in the engine.

306
00:23:24,418 --> 00:23:26,168
Turn right here.

307
00:23:26,335 --> 00:23:28,960
- Where?
- That dirt road.

308
00:23:37,293 --> 00:23:41,877
Welcome to Strawberry Fields

309
00:23:43,335 --> 00:23:46,127
"I'm not afraid of death
because I don't believe in it.

310
00:23:46,293 --> 00:23:49,418
It's just getting out of one car,
and into another."

311
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:51,127
Fucking hell!

312
00:24:54,877 --> 00:24:57,918
Start, you fucker!

313
00:25:01,127 --> 00:25:02,585
She'll murder me.

314
00:25:05,502 --> 00:25:07,335
Call a tow truck.

315
00:25:07,585 --> 00:25:08,960
Sure.

316
00:25:09,252 --> 00:25:10,960
With your name and address.

317
00:25:12,168 --> 00:25:14,668
Listen... Hear that?

318
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:17,543
Are they looking for us?

319
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:19,252
We gotta get outta here.

320
00:25:19,918 --> 00:25:22,293
No, we gotta lie low.

321
00:25:24,668 --> 00:25:25,877
What about the van?

322
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:38,293
- I located the numbers.
- It's all I found.

323
00:25:50,752 --> 00:25:51,835
I changed my mind.

324
00:25:52,002 --> 00:25:54,543
- No, I don't want to.
- It'll be over in a flash.

325
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:57,585
No, don't do it!

326
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:05,710
It had to be clone.

327
00:26:25,043 --> 00:26:26,543
Think he had a family?

328
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:27,877
Who?

329
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:29,460
The gUY-

330
00:26:30,293 --> 00:26:31,877
I'm no expert but...

331
00:26:32,043 --> 00:26:33,918
He well might have.

332
00:26:35,668 --> 00:26:37,543
I thought about it last night.

333
00:26:38,502 --> 00:26:40,960
I thought,
the dead man on our road:

334
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:43,460
a strong sign for our group.

335
00:26:43,918 --> 00:26:45,502
I've fucking had it!

336
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,502
I need help here.

337
00:26:48,293 --> 00:26:50,835
That's what you get
for choosing drums.

338
00:26:51,668 --> 00:26:53,710
Just a joke. It's okay.

339
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:56,752
It's not okay.

340
00:26:57,168 --> 00:26:58,835
Who am I talking to?

341
00:26:59,002 --> 00:27:01,252
Sure, it's nothing to you,
you have nothing.

342
00:27:01,418 --> 00:27:04,377
What do you do all day
but strum and bang chicks?

343
00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:07,127
Then where do you go?

344
00:27:07,293 --> 00:27:09,085
What would you do without us?

345
00:27:09,252 --> 00:27:10,293
Know what SocSec is?

346
00:27:10,668 --> 00:27:13,002
Sort of.

347
00:27:13,168 --> 00:27:14,627
Sort of? Cool.

348
00:27:14,793 --> 00:27:17,168
Well, I owe them a fortune.

349
00:27:17,585 --> 00:27:20,668
If I don't pay up by summer,
I shut down!

350
00:27:21,377 --> 00:27:23,543
And what do I tell the van insurance?

351
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:24,627
Asshole.

352
00:27:24,793 --> 00:27:28,168
Hey, guys, we're experiencing
incredible moments.

353
00:27:28,335 --> 00:27:32,210
This is stuff we can say
in interviews. Journalists love it.

354
00:27:32,668 --> 00:27:35,418
Except for your SocSec thing.

355
00:27:35,585 --> 00:27:38,043
That's not so cool.

356
00:27:38,210 --> 00:27:41,460
What are you talking about?

357
00:27:41,877 --> 00:27:42,835
Interviews.

358
00:27:43,002 --> 00:27:44,043
You don't get it.

359
00:27:44,210 --> 00:27:46,543
The band's dead, finished.

360
00:27:47,627 --> 00:27:48,460
Meaning?

361
00:27:49,418 --> 00:27:52,793
We talked it over
and decided to quit.

362
00:27:56,210 --> 00:27:57,460
Quit?

363
00:27:57,627 --> 00:27:58,918
You know...

364
00:27:59,543 --> 00:28:00,710
split, break up,

365
00:28:00,877 --> 00:28:03,585
not play together,
end our collaboration,

366
00:28:04,127 --> 00:28:05,502
in the long term.

367
00:28:05,668 --> 00:28:07,293
Why didn't anyone tell me?

368
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:09,293
- We tried but...
- There was Hellfest.

369
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:11,127
There's still Hellfest.

370
00:28:12,168 --> 00:28:16,127
Hang on. You think that
even if we get out of this shit,

371
00:28:16,293 --> 00:28:18,960
we'll expose ourselves at Hellfest?

372
00:28:20,835 --> 00:28:22,043
I have kids now.

373
00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:24,127
And I have the restaurant.

374
00:28:25,543 --> 00:28:27,627
And I have... plans.

375
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:35,252
The plan is clear.

376
00:28:35,418 --> 00:28:38,502
We lie low for 24 hours
to avoid any roadblocks.

377
00:28:38,668 --> 00:28:41,543
We find a way to skip out of here
nice and easy

378
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:45,918
and return to the homes we shouldn't
have left in the first place.

379
00:28:58,793 --> 00:29:01,418
It's me, honey.
I left early and forgot:

380
00:29:01,585 --> 00:29:04,085
you have swimming today,
so take your bag

381
00:29:04,252 --> 00:29:07,960
and make sure
you dry your hair, okay?

382
00:29:08,127 --> 00:29:09,377
Kisses. See you tonight.

383
00:29:09,543 --> 00:29:10,460
What?

384
00:29:10,627 --> 00:29:12,918
HQ wants to know
if we postpone rehearsal.

385
00:29:13,127 --> 00:29:14,627
Are you joking?

386
00:29:14,877 --> 00:29:17,335
We can downright cancel it.

387
00:29:19,418 --> 00:29:20,293
What?

388
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:22,293
Bureau of Investigation's here.

389
00:29:29,877 --> 00:29:32,127
We'll see. Call you back, okay?

390
00:29:32,877 --> 00:29:35,918
The B.I. wants to know
why it took 8 hours

391
00:29:36,127 --> 00:29:37,418
to find the body.

392
00:29:38,877 --> 00:29:40,377
It's Jojo.

393
00:29:43,877 --> 00:29:46,127
The witness. We know him.

394
00:29:46,293 --> 00:29:50,168
So when he turned up
jabbering about vampires

395
00:29:50,335 --> 00:29:51,752
he got an Alcotest right off.

396
00:29:51,918 --> 00:29:53,377
The guy's BAC was 0.30.

397
00:29:54,127 --> 00:29:56,627
So we stuck him in the drunk tank.

398
00:29:57,710 --> 00:29:59,668
After that, it took time

399
00:30:00,127 --> 00:30:02,377
to question him again and check...

400
00:30:05,793 --> 00:30:10,710
So, by this time,
even if they're driving at 40 mph,

401
00:30:10,877 --> 00:30:13,585
the vampires could be in Portugal,

402
00:30:15,043 --> 00:30:17,210
or even Belgium.

403
00:30:19,418 --> 00:30:20,668
That's true.

404
00:30:23,127 --> 00:30:26,002
In which case there's no point
in roadblocks.

405
00:30:27,668 --> 00:30:29,002
No point.

406
00:30:29,168 --> 00:30:30,460
That's a relief.

407
00:30:31,877 --> 00:30:34,043
For traffic flow, I mean.

408
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:37,585
We're expecting crowds tomorrow.
It's the strawberry fest.

409
00:30:49,252 --> 00:30:50,418
How do we proceed?

410
00:30:50,585 --> 00:30:53,293
What do you suggest?
You seem full of ideas.

411
00:30:54,585 --> 00:30:56,835
No point in all 4 stealing a car.

412
00:30:57,043 --> 00:30:59,002
It increases chances
of getting nabbed.

413
00:30:59,335 --> 00:31:00,377
Let's draw lots.

414
00:31:00,793 --> 00:31:03,627
No lots. With my luck I always lose.

415
00:31:03,793 --> 00:31:05,627
I say Alex goes. It's his fault.

416
00:31:07,085 --> 00:31:08,252
It's my fault now?

417
00:31:08,418 --> 00:31:10,377
Right, it's your fault.

418
00:31:10,835 --> 00:31:13,168
He chased us out at gunpoint.

419
00:31:13,793 --> 00:31:15,960
I emptied my savings
to rent his fucking club.

420
00:31:19,168 --> 00:31:20,627
You rented his club?

421
00:31:23,335 --> 00:31:24,710
Why'd you do that?

422
00:31:27,668 --> 00:31:28,793
So you'd be good.

423
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,793
So we'd be ready for tomorrow.

424
00:31:33,585 --> 00:31:36,877
I'll get you a van.
And not because it's my fault.

425
00:31:37,043 --> 00:31:37,877
But because

426
00:31:38,043 --> 00:31:39,877
I never run out on anyone.

427
00:31:40,377 --> 00:31:42,043
We're all going.

428
00:31:43,168 --> 00:31:45,418
Okay, but not like this.

429
00:31:47,127 --> 00:31:48,543
What do you mean?

430
00:31:49,668 --> 00:31:51,460
Bunch of assholes!

431
00:31:51,627 --> 00:31:54,460
Your hair'd get us spotted
a mile away.

432
00:31:54,627 --> 00:31:56,585
I could have tied it back

433
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,627
in a ponytail.

434
00:31:59,793 --> 00:32:00,960
As for tattoos...

435
00:32:06,252 --> 00:32:07,585
Hold on...

436
00:32:13,043 --> 00:32:14,002
Go ahead.

437
00:32:40,127 --> 00:32:42,127
They were like zombies.

438
00:32:42,793 --> 00:32:44,335
Like vampires.

439
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:48,002
What time was it when you heard
the car go?

440
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:50,210
I don't know.

441
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:54,543
If you don't know, forget it.

442
00:32:59,668 --> 00:33:01,127
Put out an APB with that?

443
00:33:03,835 --> 00:33:06,002
All-Points Bulletin?

444
00:33:06,502 --> 00:33:08,918
Okay, I know what an...

445
00:33:09,877 --> 00:33:10,710
APB is.

446
00:33:12,627 --> 00:33:14,127
Urgent, therefore.

447
00:33:17,293 --> 00:33:18,543
Asshole.

448
00:33:25,585 --> 00:33:26,710
Julia?

449
00:33:31,127 --> 00:33:32,877
I see you're studying hard.

450
00:33:33,918 --> 00:33:36,002
Turn it down, please?

451
00:33:39,418 --> 00:33:42,293
That's what they reminded me of.
Who are they?

452
00:33:43,793 --> 00:33:44,793
<i>WWI (Tyou care?</i>

453
00:33:47,002 --> 00:33:49,085
Do you know them?

454
00:33:49,502 --> 00:33:50,585
Who are they?

455
00:33:51,585 --> 00:33:54,460
Honey, if you snuck out

456
00:33:55,210 --> 00:33:58,502
I won't punish you.
But tell me if you've seen them.

457
00:33:59,335 --> 00:34:01,252
I've never seen them before.

458
00:34:01,418 --> 00:34:02,668
What'd they do?

459
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:05,085
A concert nearby.

460
00:34:05,918 --> 00:34:07,002
Was it good?

461
00:34:07,627 --> 00:34:08,918
A killer.

462
00:34:09,585 --> 00:34:10,835
No kidding.

463
00:34:11,502 --> 00:34:13,293
Warn me when I can sneak out.

464
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:15,418
Quit playing the martyr.

465
00:34:15,585 --> 00:34:17,377
You're the one taunting me.

466
00:34:17,877 --> 00:34:18,877
You're right.

467
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:24,085
Mom, you sure I can't go to Hellfest?

468
00:34:25,418 --> 00:34:26,710
I worked it out.

469
00:34:27,377 --> 00:34:29,127
Dozzy Cooper is in Europe
every 15 years.

470
00:34:29,627 --> 00:34:31,002
You'll have your license.

471
00:34:31,168 --> 00:34:34,127
But he'll be 80. Lend me your car.

472
00:34:34,293 --> 00:34:37,085
Get off me with your Hellfest.

473
00:34:41,043 --> 00:34:42,293
Fuck.

474
00:34:46,168 --> 00:34:49,293
What would be best for the gear
is a butcher's van.

475
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:51,835
Or a school bus.

476
00:34:53,585 --> 00:34:54,585
It's all clear.

477
00:34:54,752 --> 00:34:56,710
Enough of this shit.

478
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:00,002
I've got corn in my pants.

479
00:35:08,335 --> 00:35:11,002
It's a bummer about the band.

480
00:35:11,168 --> 00:35:12,793
Don't start, please.

481
00:35:13,543 --> 00:35:17,168
I'm just saying so
because I was going to make changes.

482
00:35:19,585 --> 00:35:20,710
You should sing.

483
00:35:21,752 --> 00:35:23,877
- Stop, I said.
- What?

484
00:35:24,043 --> 00:35:26,960
You have great stage presence.
Why waste it?

485
00:35:30,585 --> 00:35:32,418
You need self-confidence.

486
00:35:32,877 --> 00:35:34,293
You're not just fat.

487
00:35:39,252 --> 00:35:40,085
Here.

488
00:35:40,543 --> 00:35:41,377
Pick one.

489
00:35:43,877 --> 00:35:46,085
To think he made me say
on school radio

490
00:35:46,252 --> 00:35:49,293
that my grandpa raped me,
just for the group image.

491
00:35:50,793 --> 00:35:51,752
It's not funny.

492
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,377
He has to get a job.

493
00:35:54,543 --> 00:35:57,043
Even a shitty one, like yours.

494
00:35:57,293 --> 00:35:59,960
Something that structures him
as an adult,

495
00:36:00,127 --> 00:36:02,293
to give him a sense of reality...

496
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:04,377
Say, I'm doing an audition.

497
00:36:04,918 --> 00:36:05,752
You are?

498
00:36:05,918 --> 00:36:07,918
Reality TV, as you said.

499
00:36:08,335 --> 00:36:11,418
They love my tattoos.
I have a meeting in Paris.

500
00:36:11,585 --> 00:36:12,585
You're shitting me.

501
00:36:12,752 --> 00:36:14,877
I didn't say, because of the group.

502
00:36:15,043 --> 00:36:19,002
Bust we're breaking up so...
I'll be more selective with chicks.

503
00:36:19,627 --> 00:36:21,918
What a big fat turd!

504
00:36:22,627 --> 00:36:23,502
Why?

505
00:36:23,793 --> 00:36:24,877
Why?

506
00:36:25,377 --> 00:36:27,168
Say what you like about Alex,

507
00:36:27,335 --> 00:36:30,460
he's a real turd,
but he has turdish integrity.

508
00:36:30,627 --> 00:36:34,043
You deny 15 years of beliefs
to stick a feather up your ass.

509
00:36:34,210 --> 00:36:35,418
Honestly,

510
00:36:35,585 --> 00:36:36,627
you make me sick.

511
00:36:36,793 --> 00:36:38,877
- Why did I say?
- What?

512
00:36:39,252 --> 00:36:40,918
That we stop Black Metal, okay.

513
00:36:41,085 --> 00:36:42,877
That we kill a guy, why not?

514
00:36:43,043 --> 00:36:45,418
But reality TV...

515
00:36:49,627 --> 00:36:50,877
There are limits!

516
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:52,585
Fuck!

517
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,585
Your child is a rat, fruit of vice

518
00:36:56,793 --> 00:36:58,752
I slash his skinny legs to piss

519
00:36:59,502 --> 00:37:00,710
What is this?

520
00:37:01,877 --> 00:37:03,043
What?

521
00:37:04,793 --> 00:37:08,002
Give me your children
My razor will restore their smile

522
00:37:08,627 --> 00:37:10,127
What's with you?

523
00:37:10,877 --> 00:37:13,210
I've been singing that stuff
for years.

524
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:17,002
No one understands your lyrics!

525
00:37:20,168 --> 00:37:23,002
Don't take it personally.
It's not your kids.

526
00:37:24,335 --> 00:37:26,502
It's kids in general.

527
00:37:26,668 --> 00:37:28,168
Michel Berger's dead?

528
00:37:28,335 --> 00:37:29,960
Sure he is.

529
00:37:30,127 --> 00:37:32,668
The guy that sang,
Oh beautiful mountain...?

530
00:37:32,835 --> 00:37:34,668
That's Jean Ferrat.

531
00:37:34,835 --> 00:37:38,627
Jean Ferrat? The one
who lives alone with his mother?

532
00:37:38,793 --> 00:37:40,293
- That's...
- No, that's Aznavour.

533
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:42,085
And all those guys are dead?

534
00:37:42,252 --> 00:37:44,752
- All of 'em.
- Aznavour's still alive.

535
00:37:44,918 --> 00:37:46,293
He's been dead for ages!

536
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:47,627
- You nuts?
- He is!

537
00:37:47,793 --> 00:37:50,127
Henri Salvador's the one still alive.

538
00:37:50,293 --> 00:37:52,668
We don't mean the same guys, so...

539
00:37:52,835 --> 00:37:54,460
I know where they are.

540
00:37:54,627 --> 00:37:56,960
At a Heavy Metal fest 250 miles away.

541
00:37:57,377 --> 00:37:59,418
I bet they were headed there.

542
00:38:03,793 --> 00:38:05,793
Got the local gendarmes' number?

543
00:38:10,210 --> 00:38:12,627
Tell the guys. We're heading out.

544
00:38:18,002 --> 00:38:18,835
Thanks.

545
00:38:20,168 --> 00:38:21,460
Don't mention it.

546
00:38:28,377 --> 00:38:29,668
Four of them.

547
00:38:30,293 --> 00:38:31,460
Four.

548
00:38:32,043 --> 00:38:35,627
Age 20-40, tattoos, long hair,
dressed in black, rocker style.

549
00:38:36,127 --> 00:38:37,168
I'll send descriptions.

550
00:38:37,335 --> 00:38:40,793
Have any IDs?
Descriptions won't be enough.

551
00:39:08,418 --> 00:39:11,752
There's a truck, but guard clogs, too.
Gotta return after dark.

552
00:39:11,918 --> 00:39:14,627
Sure, everyone knows
clogs don't keep watch at night.

553
00:39:14,793 --> 00:39:16,960
They kick back and drink beer.

554
00:39:18,543 --> 00:39:20,043
- What's with him?
- Skip it.

555
00:39:21,877 --> 00:39:25,418
- What about you?
- We found a combine harvester.

556
00:39:28,210 --> 00:39:30,335
Ride a combine for 400 miles?

557
00:39:30,502 --> 00:39:31,460
That's all we found.

558
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:34,127
There's nothing else
but strawberries.

559
00:39:34,835 --> 00:39:37,002
It's that or we ride a cow home.

560
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:41,002
If we're not gone tomorrow,

561
00:39:41,168 --> 00:39:43,668
I'll bury the gear and walk home!

562
00:39:43,835 --> 00:39:45,877
No one buries my gear!

563
00:39:46,043 --> 00:39:47,710
I'll pay you back.

564
00:39:49,252 --> 00:39:50,877
You found the magic words.

565
00:39:51,043 --> 00:39:52,085
Can it.

566
00:39:52,252 --> 00:39:53,252
Lay off.

567
00:39:58,252 --> 00:40:00,002
Get the lab results yet?

568
00:40:00,168 --> 00:40:05,127
The blood on the road is actually
a mix of ketchup and coffee.

569
00:40:06,252 --> 00:40:08,043
Honestly!

570
00:40:08,293 --> 00:40:11,002
Can't you take it seriously

571
00:40:11,252 --> 00:40:14,002
for once something happens
around here?

572
00:40:14,168 --> 00:40:16,877
I swear that's what they told me.

573
00:40:17,252 --> 00:40:20,502
Ketchup and coffee.
I'm as stumped as you are.

574
00:40:21,877 --> 00:40:24,043
We're taking all this real seriously.

575
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,585
Come on, get moving.

576
00:40:31,252 --> 00:40:33,252
One, two, three, four...

577
00:41:27,043 --> 00:41:29,960
Look, I owe you guys an apology.

578
00:41:31,793 --> 00:41:35,793
I haven't taken all your aspirations
into account.

579
00:41:36,877 --> 00:41:37,710
I'm sorry.

580
00:41:43,085 --> 00:41:46,043
Since we have time,
it might be a good idea

581
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:48,418
for everyone to speak his mind

582
00:41:49,085 --> 00:41:51,543
about how to get along better.

583
00:41:52,418 --> 00:41:53,502
Forget about it.

584
00:41:54,252 --> 00:41:55,877
The band is dead.

585
00:41:57,918 --> 00:41:59,710
I'm not talking about music.

586
00:42:01,752 --> 00:42:03,543
I'm talking about friendship.

587
00:42:05,668 --> 00:42:07,210
We're not just musicians.

588
00:42:14,293 --> 00:42:16,043
So we're no longer buddies?

589
00:42:16,752 --> 00:42:17,668
Is that it?

590
00:42:20,085 --> 00:42:21,502
I dunno... Pascal,

591
00:42:22,043 --> 00:42:23,335
while you're at it,

592
00:42:24,377 --> 00:42:25,710
go ahead.

593
00:42:27,918 --> 00:42:29,210
We're listening.

594
00:42:30,335 --> 00:42:31,168
I'm listening.

595
00:42:31,502 --> 00:42:33,793
All the crap in my life
is your fault.

596
00:42:37,210 --> 00:42:38,877
The arrest in the cemetery,

597
00:42:39,043 --> 00:42:40,585
the lousy tours,

598
00:42:41,377 --> 00:42:43,002
seeing a man die,

599
00:42:43,293 --> 00:42:44,710
my van.

600
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:48,460
When shit happens, you're there.

601
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:50,835
I've noticed that.

602
00:42:52,043 --> 00:42:54,752
Okay. That's good.

603
00:42:55,377 --> 00:42:57,418
It's good to let off steam.

604
00:42:57,585 --> 00:42:59,460
Yeah, it had to come out.

605
00:43:00,752 --> 00:43:02,168
I'll just say thanks.

606
00:43:04,377 --> 00:43:05,418
So“.JP?

607
00:43:06,377 --> 00:43:09,085
I don't see why
we have to stay friends

608
00:43:09,252 --> 00:43:11,668
and have this moronic discussion.

609
00:43:25,918 --> 00:43:27,210
What's with you?

610
00:43:29,918 --> 00:43:31,252
I'm disgusted.

611
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:34,002
No, there.

612
00:43:35,377 --> 00:43:37,085
You've got red blotches.

613
00:43:38,752 --> 00:43:40,043
That's nothing.

614
00:43:40,877 --> 00:43:42,002
It's nothing?

615
00:43:43,502 --> 00:43:45,127
You're covered with them.

616
00:43:47,502 --> 00:43:49,835
What do you care, anyway?

617
00:43:54,543 --> 00:43:55,585
Okay, 1'll tell you.

618
00:43:55,752 --> 00:43:58,168
But not a word to my grandma.

619
00:43:58,335 --> 00:43:59,252
About what?

620
00:43:59,418 --> 00:44:02,377
I swear, if you say anything,
I'll cream you!

621
00:44:02,543 --> 00:44:04,668
About what, for chrissakes?

622
00:44:06,877 --> 00:44:07,752
I'm ill.

623
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:10,918
You're ill?

624
00:44:12,502 --> 00:44:14,335
I have cancer.

625
00:44:14,543 --> 00:44:15,377
I have cancer!

626
00:44:18,043 --> 00:44:18,877
Skin cancer.

627
00:44:19,502 --> 00:44:20,377
What?

628
00:44:22,210 --> 00:44:23,418
What is this?

629
00:44:29,835 --> 00:44:31,293
From the tattoos?

630
00:44:32,418 --> 00:44:34,168
No shit.

631
00:44:34,543 --> 00:44:36,085
Your hair's gonna fall out?

632
00:44:36,252 --> 00:44:38,668
I'll have to wear a skull cap
in summer.

633
00:44:38,835 --> 00:44:40,043
Like a rapper.

634
00:44:45,710 --> 00:44:48,085
That's why
I want this concert so bad.

635
00:44:48,252 --> 00:44:49,752
Oh, man.

636
00:44:53,002 --> 00:44:55,710
A great memory to take to chemo.

637
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:58,668
I thought maybe we could...

638
00:44:59,335 --> 00:45:01,918
Maybe give it some thought,

639
00:45:02,752 --> 00:45:04,127
like...

640
00:45:06,752 --> 00:45:07,918
Strawberries?

641
00:45:09,752 --> 00:45:11,335
Are you nuts?

642
00:45:11,627 --> 00:45:13,252
What the hell you doing?

643
00:45:13,627 --> 00:45:16,918
It's a rash.
He ate too many strawberries.

644
00:45:18,418 --> 00:45:21,502
Cancer, or a rash from strawberries?

645
00:45:21,668 --> 00:45:23,377
My daughter gets it, too.

646
00:45:24,543 --> 00:45:26,127
So that's what kids are for.

647
00:45:26,293 --> 00:45:27,918
- Fuck!
- What an asshole!

648
00:45:36,168 --> 00:45:37,418
What's...

649
00:45:39,627 --> 00:45:41,543
Julia? You home?

650
00:45:48,877 --> 00:45:50,252
Julia, open up.

651
00:45:50,418 --> 00:45:51,710
What?

652
00:45:58,418 --> 00:45:59,918
I need your help.

653
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:03,543
What you should know is,

654
00:46:03,710 --> 00:46:06,502
Black Metal is way more extreme
than Heavy Metal.

655
00:46:06,668 --> 00:46:07,960
No comparison.

656
00:46:10,918 --> 00:46:13,168
- I know what you're gonna say.
- Do you?

657
00:46:13,335 --> 00:46:15,668
Heavy Metal comes from hard rock

658
00:46:16,002 --> 00:46:18,543
which comes from rock,
which comes from...

659
00:46:19,002 --> 00:46:20,960
Blues. Exactly.

660
00:46:21,127 --> 00:46:22,835
Well, blues is the tritone.

661
00:46:23,002 --> 00:46:24,252
What's the blues?

662
00:46:24,918 --> 00:46:27,085
A series of strange chords,

663
00:46:27,252 --> 00:46:29,293
as if they were cursed.

664
00:46:30,793 --> 00:46:32,335
The devil's note.

665
00:46:44,335 --> 00:46:45,585
In the early 1980s,

666
00:46:46,002 --> 00:46:47,085
a revolution!

667
00:46:47,252 --> 00:46:51,127
Brit rockers can the blues influence
and impose their own folklore,

668
00:46:52,668 --> 00:46:54,585
drawing on classical music...

669
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:57,793
And even Celtic music.

670
00:47:01,127 --> 00:47:03,168
All that led to Heavy Metal.

671
00:47:09,877 --> 00:47:11,918
A huge variety of styles came along:

672
00:47:12,293 --> 00:47:13,627
Speed Metal...

673
00:47:16,168 --> 00:47:17,627
Trash Metal...

674
00:47:19,335 --> 00:47:21,043
Death Metal...

675
00:47:23,710 --> 00:47:25,252
In the early 1990s

676
00:47:25,418 --> 00:47:29,293
came the most radical, the gloomiest,

677
00:47:29,627 --> 00:47:31,877
the most satanic version of Metal:

678
00:47:32,043 --> 00:47:35,293
Black Metal.

679
00:48:37,835 --> 00:48:39,127
What's that?

680
00:48:39,585 --> 00:48:41,752
Dead Stifs unplugged.

681
00:48:42,627 --> 00:48:43,460
I like it.

682
00:48:43,627 --> 00:48:44,877
Yes, it's nice.

683
00:48:45,043 --> 00:48:47,377
Nice. That's just it.

684
00:48:48,085 --> 00:48:50,293
Why not Besame Mucho?

685
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:52,710
Keep it UP-

686
00:48:56,752 --> 00:48:57,835
Hey]

687
00:48:58,002 --> 00:48:59,543
Your tattoos won't go away.

688
00:48:59,835 --> 00:49:01,918
You can't erase 15 years easily.

689
00:49:02,877 --> 00:49:06,668
Or it means what you did
for those 15 years was worthless.

690
00:49:08,418 --> 00:49:10,002
Is all this meaningless?

691
00:49:13,418 --> 00:49:15,752
You owe yourselves one last concert.

692
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:18,960
For the road. A farewell concert.

693
00:49:20,210 --> 00:49:23,335
Okay,
but then we go our separate ways.

694
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:24,918
I promise.

695
00:49:26,168 --> 00:49:27,127
Promise?

696
00:49:30,168 --> 00:49:32,293
- You swear?
- Swear to God.

697
00:49:33,293 --> 00:49:34,127
I swear.

698
00:49:47,627 --> 00:49:49,460
Well, it's...

699
00:49:50,293 --> 00:49:53,043
my 7th album, so...

700
00:49:54,127 --> 00:49:57,918
I focus on the message because...

701
00:49:59,127 --> 00:50:03,335
it's like a cry for all those who
don't believe the crap we get fed.

702
00:50:04,377 --> 00:50:06,210
I'm a free artist.

703
00:50:09,002 --> 00:50:10,168
Totally, absolutely

704
00:50:10,335 --> 00:50:12,460
viscerally free.

705
00:50:14,002 --> 00:50:17,293
So I shop on Tuesdays
because it's less crowded.

706
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:20,043
I like noise.

707
00:50:29,085 --> 00:50:32,043
Interview with Dozzy Cooper,
inventor of shock rock.

708
00:50:36,168 --> 00:50:38,168
Hey, I found a van!

709
00:50:39,543 --> 00:50:41,918
Martine, we found the van!

710
00:50:44,085 --> 00:50:45,543
Stop! That's good.

711
00:51:04,835 --> 00:51:07,127
This goes from bad to worse. Look.

712
00:51:08,335 --> 00:51:09,502
Shit.

713
00:51:11,627 --> 00:51:14,460
Set up roadblocks.
They may not be far after all.

714
00:51:17,502 --> 00:51:19,252
Did you call the B.I.?

715
00:51:19,543 --> 00:51:22,127
Hands off.
They're sending in technicians.

716
00:51:22,418 --> 00:51:24,210
It's a professional job:

717
00:51:24,377 --> 00:51:27,543
no license plates,
engine number filed off.

718
00:51:28,335 --> 00:51:32,168
It'll take clays to get it to talk.
If it ever does.

719
00:51:46,460 --> 00:51:49,127
Happy Fu, can I help you?

720
00:51:50,543 --> 00:51:51,710
YES, Why?

721
00:51:52,085 --> 00:51:53,502
Is there a problem?

722
00:52:28,377 --> 00:52:29,252
Forget it!

723
00:52:29,418 --> 00:52:31,460
Move it!

724
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:47,168
Enough outta him.

725
00:52:47,627 --> 00:52:49,710
I think he wants his guitar.

726
00:52:49,877 --> 00:52:52,293
We're not thieves. Hang on.

727
00:53:10,668 --> 00:53:13,002
We swiped ourselves Scooby-Doo's van.

728
00:53:26,543 --> 00:53:27,877
The B.I.

729
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:34,293
Yes?

730
00:53:34,627 --> 00:53:35,793
Happy now?

731
00:53:36,210 --> 00:53:37,460
Just doing my job.

732
00:53:37,627 --> 00:53:41,793
And we're doing miles!
After 24 hours of shitty music!

733
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:43,085
Loud!

734
00:53:43,418 --> 00:53:45,335
They could very well be
at Hellfest.

735
00:53:45,502 --> 00:53:47,710
How would they get there?
Hitchhike?

736
00:53:47,877 --> 00:53:49,460
Look.

737
00:53:49,627 --> 00:53:51,043
Stop having ideas.

738
00:53:51,210 --> 00:53:54,543
Stop taking initiative
and stick to your fair!

739
00:53:57,585 --> 00:53:58,752
Shit.

740
00:53:59,543 --> 00:54:00,627
What do I do?

741
00:54:01,502 --> 00:54:02,627
Step on it!

742
00:54:07,585 --> 00:54:09,418
Gendarmerie...

743
00:54:09,918 --> 00:54:12,668
Vehicle registration,
driver's license,

744
00:54:12,835 --> 00:54:16,418
and ID for all your passengers,
please.

745
00:54:20,002 --> 00:54:21,668
You going to the festival?

746
00:54:24,835 --> 00:54:26,127
Well, gentlemen,

747
00:54:27,752 --> 00:54:28,877
I'm sorry to say

748
00:54:31,043 --> 00:54:32,918
that it's behind you!

749
00:54:33,543 --> 00:54:34,668
It's the other way.

750
00:54:36,293 --> 00:54:38,168
What dreamers!

751
00:54:38,752 --> 00:54:41,418
Hey, Mickey,
they're going to St. Peperac.

752
00:54:41,585 --> 00:54:42,877
We'll lead the way.

753
00:55:21,210 --> 00:55:22,960
So there really is a Hell.

754
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:28,252
Did they get lost?

755
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:39,877
Did they understand?

756
00:55:40,043 --> 00:55:41,127
Go on.

757
00:55:41,293 --> 00:55:42,418
They go on first.

758
00:55:42,585 --> 00:55:44,502
It's the band playing before you.

759
00:55:44,918 --> 00:55:45,793
Go ahead.

760
00:55:49,377 --> 00:55:50,710
What do we do?

761
00:55:51,335 --> 00:55:53,502
He parks and we slip away quietly.

762
00:55:53,668 --> 00:55:54,960
And the gear?

763
00:55:55,127 --> 00:55:56,960
Quit busting our balls about that!

764
00:55:57,127 --> 00:55:59,293
Our name's on each instrument.

765
00:56:02,543 --> 00:56:03,960
Give them a big hand.

766
00:56:04,127 --> 00:56:06,877
William and Guillaume Bingaleau.

767
00:56:07,043 --> 00:56:08,960
They're great, and good-looking,

768
00:56:09,418 --> 00:56:10,668
which helps.

769
00:56:10,835 --> 00:56:11,793
So...

770
00:56:12,793 --> 00:56:17,043
The Conurbation of St. Peperac...

771
00:56:17,752 --> 00:56:20,043
I'm on the selection committee.

772
00:56:20,918 --> 00:56:22,585
I put in a word for you.

773
00:56:23,002 --> 00:56:24,252
I'm a real fan.

774
00:56:25,043 --> 00:56:27,085
I don't think they speak French.

775
00:56:29,543 --> 00:56:31,960
Music is a universal language.

776
00:56:41,293 --> 00:56:43,210
Is this whole town bonkers?

777
00:56:43,377 --> 00:56:44,752
What do we do?

778
00:56:47,252 --> 00:56:48,585
Are there clothes?

779
00:56:50,168 --> 00:56:54,002
In just a moment,
All You Need Is Love.

780
00:56:54,460 --> 00:56:56,252
Give them a big hand.

781
00:56:56,418 --> 00:56:58,835
First, Guyot Shancar

782
00:56:59,002 --> 00:57:01,502
and his magic sitar.

783
00:57:02,668 --> 00:57:05,127
Didn't you get a t-shirt?

784
00:57:05,502 --> 00:57:06,335
Sure.

785
00:57:07,252 --> 00:57:09,793
Take that backstage.
They need drinks.

786
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:11,127
Do I have a choice?

787
00:57:15,418 --> 00:57:16,627
Better and better.

788
00:57:16,793 --> 00:57:18,793
Of course it's not real.

789
00:57:20,127 --> 00:57:22,460
But who'd run around with a skeleton?

790
00:57:22,627 --> 00:57:23,710
Hurry, the uniform.

791
00:57:23,877 --> 00:57:26,002
What? I'm listening.

792
00:57:26,668 --> 00:57:28,377
Now that's interesting.

793
00:57:33,210 --> 00:57:35,710
Ballistics says they were shot at.

794
00:57:41,710 --> 00:57:42,960
This is ridiculous.

795
00:57:43,127 --> 00:57:44,335
Why Pajamas?

796
00:57:46,377 --> 00:57:48,460
Get in, your tattoos are showing.

797
00:58:20,085 --> 00:58:23,710
Let's have an ovation
for the group we already call

798
00:58:23,877 --> 00:58:26,002
the Beatles of St. Peperac:

799
00:58:26,710 --> 00:58:28,502
All You Need Is Love.

800
00:58:36,627 --> 00:58:39,085
Guys, it's a sign!

801
00:58:39,252 --> 00:58:41,293
A Black Metal concert will wipe

802
00:58:41,460 --> 00:58:43,877
the redneck glee off their faces!

803
00:58:44,043 --> 00:58:47,335
Give them what they want,
or I'll tear your head off.

804
00:58:48,002 --> 00:58:49,668
How do I know what they want?

805
00:58:49,835 --> 00:58:52,627
If I smack you with my bass,
it's wrong.

806
00:58:52,793 --> 00:58:54,793
And now, All You Need Is Love!

807
00:59:28,460 --> 00:59:29,293
Go on.

808
01:01:39,627 --> 01:01:41,293
Encore!

809
01:01:45,168 --> 01:01:47,543
That was wild! Wild!

810
01:01:47,710 --> 01:01:49,043
Look! Listen!

811
01:01:49,210 --> 01:01:51,710
The first encore of our lifetime!

812
01:01:51,877 --> 01:01:53,043
He was the best.

813
01:01:53,210 --> 01:01:54,877
You put me to shame!

814
01:01:55,085 --> 01:01:57,335
You morons played pop with a smile.

815
01:01:57,627 --> 01:01:58,918
I'm canceling Hellfest.

816
01:01:59,085 --> 01:02:01,627
Skip it. We're not doing Hellfest.

817
01:02:01,918 --> 01:02:03,377
You owe me a concert.

818
01:02:04,168 --> 01:02:05,668
We just played one.

819
01:02:07,502 --> 01:02:08,543
Shall we go back?

820
01:02:08,710 --> 01:02:10,127
What do we risk?

821
01:02:11,085 --> 01:02:13,210
Do that and I split with the van.

822
01:02:16,293 --> 01:02:18,502
You can't quit, I'm firing you!

823
01:02:19,668 --> 01:02:21,460
All three of you!

824
01:03:03,043 --> 01:03:05,585
Who are these guys?

825
01:03:06,127 --> 01:03:07,752
Keep 'em warm for me.

826
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:33,793
What?

827
01:03:35,168 --> 01:03:37,502
Get a toxicology test ready, please.

828
01:06:02,752 --> 01:06:05,127
Don't freak out. I know everything.

829
01:06:05,835 --> 01:06:07,460
I know you're innocent.

830
01:06:08,377 --> 01:06:11,335
Or if you're not,
you had good reasons.

831
01:06:11,960 --> 01:06:13,168
You listening?

832
01:06:15,127 --> 01:06:18,210
Okay, we gotta hurry.
The others were arrested.

833
01:06:18,377 --> 01:06:19,710
Bunch of jerks.

834
01:06:21,793 --> 01:06:22,877
Look,

835
01:06:23,668 --> 01:06:25,252
I'll get to the point.

836
01:06:26,210 --> 01:06:27,585
Take me to Hellfest.

837
01:06:29,543 --> 01:06:31,502
Don't be a fucktard. Take me!

838
01:06:31,668 --> 01:06:33,668
Beat it. Fuck the Hellfest.

839
01:06:34,127 --> 01:06:37,502
No way! It's the Hellfest, dammit!

840
01:06:38,252 --> 01:06:39,752
Why do you say fuck it?

841
01:06:41,668 --> 01:06:43,627
Who are you?

842
01:06:45,168 --> 01:06:46,543
My grandmother's dead.

843
01:06:46,710 --> 01:06:47,793
Excuse me?

844
01:06:49,043 --> 01:06:51,752
My grandmother's dead.
Why am I telling you?

845
01:06:52,835 --> 01:06:54,168
Was she ill?

846
01:07:10,585 --> 01:07:15,377
We didn't smear it with blood.
The singer's squirter went off.

847
01:07:15,668 --> 01:07:17,668
Right. Tell me another one.

848
01:07:17,835 --> 01:07:18,877
You doing this on purpose?

849
01:07:19,043 --> 01:07:21,293
It was a stroke of luck.

850
01:07:21,460 --> 01:07:23,293
You don't say. Now look:

851
01:07:23,460 --> 01:07:27,918
I forbid you to proceed
without us. Is that clear?

852
01:07:29,085 --> 01:07:30,293
It's clear.

853
01:07:30,460 --> 01:07:32,210
I can't hear.

854
01:07:32,377 --> 01:07:35,460
That damn festival
busted my eardrums.

855
01:07:47,752 --> 01:07:49,002
ABBEY ROAD

856
01:09:42,293 --> 01:09:43,877
There are more raffle tickets.

857
01:09:44,043 --> 01:09:45,918
Don't miss out. Hurry.

858
01:09:46,085 --> 01:09:50,043
First prize is your weight
in strawberries.

859
01:09:50,210 --> 01:09:52,585
Not for you, Marie-Pierre,

860
01:09:52,752 --> 01:09:54,793
you'd make the town go broke.

861
01:09:55,168 --> 01:09:57,210
It's JP.

862
01:09:58,543 --> 01:09:59,377
Where are you?

863
01:09:59,543 --> 01:10:01,043
In a...

864
01:10:01,752 --> 01:10:02,960
I'll explain.

865
01:10:03,418 --> 01:10:05,627
We know, the gendarmes called.

866
01:10:05,793 --> 01:10:07,335
Yue-Yu and I are on our way.

867
01:10:07,502 --> 01:10:09,002
What happened?

868
01:10:09,502 --> 01:10:12,335
It's a mistake.
We didn't kill anyone.

869
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:14,668
Thanks, I don't doubt it.

870
01:10:15,335 --> 01:10:17,168
Somehow that's reassuring.

871
01:10:17,335 --> 01:10:18,168
Excuse me.

872
01:10:18,335 --> 01:10:19,918
I married a rocker.

873
01:10:20,252 --> 01:10:23,918
I see guys who have it together
at the office every clay. Yuck.

874
01:10:25,918 --> 01:10:27,085
I love you.

875
01:10:33,460 --> 01:10:34,460
Well?

876
01:10:43,127 --> 01:10:44,835
They're on their way.

877
01:10:45,252 --> 01:10:47,502
With Yue-Yu? She knows?

878
01:10:50,335 --> 01:10:52,252
I think I'd rather go to jail.

879
01:10:56,002 --> 01:10:58,835
She's been on my click for weeks.

880
01:10:59,043 --> 01:11:00,460
She wants a kid.

881
01:11:00,627 --> 01:11:04,877
She wants him to be born in spring.
It's more Feng-Shui. Nuts!

882
01:11:05,043 --> 01:11:07,710
And we have to wait
until she's ovulating.

883
01:11:07,877 --> 01:11:11,168
Then I'm on round the clock.
I can't give anymore.

884
01:11:14,085 --> 01:11:15,752
Why are you telling us?

885
01:11:17,835 --> 01:11:19,127
I dunno.

886
01:11:19,293 --> 01:11:21,460
My life's passing before my eyes.

887
01:11:23,418 --> 01:11:24,835
It's so embarrassing.

888
01:12:20,460 --> 01:12:22,127
What clods!

889
01:12:22,293 --> 01:12:24,460
I told you to go after number 4.

890
01:12:24,627 --> 01:12:27,668
I'm not sure,
but I think Julia was driving.

891
01:12:29,752 --> 01:12:30,877
Excuse me?

892
01:12:35,668 --> 01:12:36,918
I know where they're going.

893
01:12:37,252 --> 01:12:38,793
Get the B.I. to intercept.

894
01:12:39,127 --> 01:12:40,252
No way!

895
01:12:40,710 --> 01:12:44,127
Georges, please.
She's a minor in a stolen vehicle.

896
01:12:44,293 --> 01:12:45,918
If we could keep it quiet...

897
01:12:50,377 --> 01:12:52,210
I suggest you go change

898
01:12:52,752 --> 01:12:54,960
if you go to this metallic festival.

899
01:12:56,210 --> 01:12:57,043
Go on.

900
01:12:57,627 --> 01:12:58,877
Rock and roll!

901
01:12:59,918 --> 01:13:01,210
Thanks, sir.

902
01:13:01,752 --> 01:13:03,877
- Band, disperse!
- What?

903
01:13:04,127 --> 01:13:07,585
Take us back to strawberryland
before things get worse.

904
01:13:08,877 --> 01:13:10,293
Get worse, how?

905
01:13:12,293 --> 01:13:14,252
Mini-vampire's right.

906
01:13:14,502 --> 01:13:16,002
We gotta do this concert.

907
01:13:16,168 --> 01:13:18,210
You stripped a gear? No way.

908
01:13:18,377 --> 01:13:21,085
We'll do a concert,
then give ourselves up.

909
01:13:21,460 --> 01:13:23,835
We just did the gig of a lifetime.

910
01:13:24,043 --> 01:13:26,918
We can play anything.
Musically, we walk on water.

911
01:13:27,085 --> 01:13:28,252
And I'm first a rocker.

912
01:13:28,627 --> 01:13:31,460
Who the hell cares!
We've got other problems.

913
01:13:32,127 --> 01:13:33,002
Listen to me.

914
01:13:33,168 --> 01:13:34,210
Either we're charged,

915
01:13:34,377 --> 01:13:37,793
and this concert's the last fun
we'll have for a while.

916
01:13:38,085 --> 01:13:40,377
- Or they let us go...
- And?

917
01:13:41,252 --> 01:13:43,168
In a month Yue-Yu's pregnant.

918
01:13:43,335 --> 01:13:45,960
And this is your last holiday
for 15 years.

919
01:13:46,127 --> 01:13:48,293
And that's if you only have one.

920
01:13:48,460 --> 01:13:49,710
Leave him alone.

921
01:13:49,877 --> 01:13:51,793
He already has SocSec trouble.

922
01:13:54,418 --> 01:13:55,543
Okay, let's do it.

923
01:13:55,835 --> 01:13:56,835
Erik?

924
01:13:58,335 --> 01:13:59,793
I agree.

925
01:14:00,210 --> 01:14:03,127
- Just let me do a solo.
- Okay.

926
01:14:03,918 --> 01:14:05,918
But we've lost our singer.

927
01:14:26,210 --> 01:14:27,710
So we're back together?

928
01:14:28,335 --> 01:14:30,585
Like any cash-strapped old band?

929
01:14:33,627 --> 01:14:35,960
Except we only split for 5 minutes.

930
01:14:36,752 --> 01:14:38,793
And we never made a dime.

931
01:14:58,585 --> 01:15:01,127
Growing moustaches was just part
of being a hippy:

932
01:15:01,293 --> 01:15:05,002
We were turning into Sgt Peppers.
As if we were metamorphosing.

933
01:15:09,835 --> 01:15:12,710
Chief! The B.I. guys are coming!

934
01:15:12,877 --> 01:15:14,502
The B.I.

935
01:15:21,335 --> 01:15:22,960
What a nice clay to die.

936
01:15:28,377 --> 01:15:29,835
You taking me for a ride?

937
01:15:30,002 --> 01:15:32,002
I just drove 250 miles the other way.

938
01:15:32,168 --> 01:15:34,835
What's your paddy wagon?
A cattle truck?

939
01:15:35,002 --> 01:15:37,835
Either get down to work

940
01:15:38,002 --> 01:15:40,752
or... Damn it!

941
01:15:42,210 --> 01:15:43,752
Go make me coffee.

942
01:15:45,168 --> 01:15:47,127
I have tea if you'd rather.

943
01:17:07,460 --> 01:17:09,293
We're here. What's the deal?

944
01:17:10,543 --> 01:17:11,627
What's this about?

945
01:17:11,793 --> 01:17:14,293
A hot concert: Dead Stifs.
Where's the stage?

946
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:16,960
Where you been? It's over.

947
01:17:17,252 --> 01:17:18,627
You were replaced.

948
01:17:19,460 --> 01:17:21,002
The subs got subbed, right?

949
01:17:21,168 --> 01:17:22,210
Is this a joke?

950
01:17:22,377 --> 01:17:23,918
You can't do this to us.

951
01:17:24,085 --> 01:17:26,835
I already did.
Now I'll work on your name.

952
01:17:27,002 --> 01:17:29,127
You'll be blacklisted to Romania!

953
01:17:29,293 --> 01:17:30,127
I must be dreaming!

954
01:17:30,293 --> 01:17:32,793
5 minutes late
and you throw a hissy fit?

955
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:35,085
They were due 3 hours ago!

956
01:17:35,252 --> 01:17:36,502
They're artists, not bus drivers!

957
01:17:36,918 --> 01:17:39,502
You're a minor.
Where's your chaperone?

958
01:17:40,335 --> 01:17:41,710
She's my daughter.

959
01:17:56,668 --> 01:18:00,168
When I think you did all this
just to see your Dozzy...

960
01:18:00,335 --> 01:18:03,418
It's not!
It's so they can go on stage.

961
01:18:03,585 --> 01:18:05,668
You know we're innocent.

962
01:18:05,835 --> 01:18:08,543
And the hit-and-run?
Auto theft?

963
01:18:08,710 --> 01:18:10,418
Identity fraud?

964
01:18:10,710 --> 01:18:11,752
Jailbreaking?

965
01:18:12,418 --> 01:18:14,710
Help us,
and I'll answer for anything.

966
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:16,502
No way.

967
01:18:17,460 --> 01:18:18,877
Then I'll tell the judge

968
01:18:19,043 --> 01:18:21,210
your daughter broke us out.

969
01:18:23,335 --> 01:18:24,293
Excuse me?

970
01:18:25,002 --> 01:18:26,752
Just let me go backstage.

971
01:18:27,293 --> 01:18:28,543
I gotta see Dozzy Cooper.

972
01:18:28,710 --> 01:18:30,585
How? I'm no magician.

973
01:18:37,002 --> 01:18:38,752
He's a Norwegian singer.

974
01:18:38,918 --> 01:18:41,543
Fought with his guitarist.
I'm taking him back.

975
01:18:41,710 --> 01:18:43,002
Which group?

976
01:18:43,168 --> 01:18:44,168
Which group?

977
01:18:44,668 --> 01:18:46,002
The Black...

978
01:18:46,168 --> 01:18:47,043
Black what?

979
01:18:47,210 --> 01:18:50,460
The Black...

980
01:18:50,627 --> 01:18:53,043
But is it Black Murder,
Black Death, Black Black?

981
01:18:53,210 --> 01:18:55,043
It's this!

982
01:19:36,085 --> 01:19:38,460
If he's not back in 5 minutes,

983
01:19:38,627 --> 01:19:41,585
I leave you guys at security
and take you home.

984
01:19:41,752 --> 01:19:42,585
He'll be back.

985
01:19:42,877 --> 01:19:45,668
No he won't. His stunt didn't work.

986
01:19:45,835 --> 01:19:47,085
Yeah, he screwed up.

987
01:19:47,252 --> 01:19:48,668
How can you say that?

988
01:19:48,835 --> 01:19:51,585
He'll miss his grandma's funeral
for this!

989
01:19:52,502 --> 01:19:53,377
What?

990
01:19:53,585 --> 01:19:55,085
His grandmother's not dead.

991
01:19:56,585 --> 01:19:57,793
Another crock.

992
01:19:58,168 --> 01:19:59,002
Sure.

993
01:20:04,835 --> 01:20:07,002
What'd he say exactly?

994
01:20:07,502 --> 01:20:11,085
The home helper
found her dead in bed.

995
01:20:19,085 --> 01:20:20,918
What a bunch of long faces.

996
01:20:27,043 --> 01:20:27,877
We're on for tonight.

997
01:20:30,252 --> 01:20:31,793
Where?

998
01:20:32,002 --> 01:20:33,293
On the main stage.

999
01:20:34,877 --> 01:20:35,710
Are you okay?

1000
01:20:37,502 --> 01:20:39,085
Yeah, great.

1001
01:20:39,835 --> 01:20:42,793
Don't you want to sit down

1002
01:20:43,293 --> 01:20:44,502
with us?

1003
01:20:44,918 --> 01:20:46,627
You don't have to do this concert.

1004
01:20:46,793 --> 01:20:49,835
There's a time to play,
and a time to chill out.

1005
01:20:50,752 --> 01:20:51,960
We'll chill when we're dead.

1006
01:21:12,585 --> 01:21:14,752
Hey, metal-heads!

1007
01:21:15,210 --> 01:21:18,252
Dozzy's on his way.
We're a bit behind,

1008
01:21:18,877 --> 01:21:22,543
so to tide you over, a little
surprise. So make some noise!

1009
01:21:24,127 --> 01:21:25,585
The Dead Stifs!

1010
01:22:23,585 --> 01:22:24,585
You sure of this?

1011
01:22:25,835 --> 01:22:28,043
Dozzy won't play if these pansies
don't open for him.

1012
01:22:51,335 --> 01:22:52,460
It's Daddy!

1013
01:23:42,043 --> 01:23:45,752
Strong, strong, strong,

1014
01:23:46,168 --> 01:23:48,502
My spirit is strong

1015
01:24:21,918 --> 01:24:23,085
I don't give a fuck!

1016
01:24:23,252 --> 01:24:24,293
Where's the stage?

1017
01:24:25,877 --> 01:24:28,335
- It's under control.
- What're you doing here?

1018
01:24:29,418 --> 01:24:30,793
I took the initiative.

1019
01:24:30,960 --> 01:24:33,293
What initiative? For the past hour...

1020
01:25:43,585 --> 01:25:45,210
Holy shit!

1021
01:25:46,210 --> 01:25:47,835
Hot damn! We did it!

1022
01:26:10,210 --> 01:26:11,543
They're all yours.

1023
01:26:28,252 --> 01:26:30,710
He really wanted his cross that bad?

1024
01:27:20,835 --> 01:27:22,377
Let's take it from the top.

1025
01:30:09,585 --> 01:30:11,877
Didn't you give it back to Dozzy?

1026
01:30:12,210 --> 01:30:13,960
- The real one?
- What?

1027
01:30:14,127 --> 01:30:15,835
I don't carry it around.

1028
01:30:16,002 --> 01:30:17,210
I made a copy.

1029
01:30:28,085 --> 01:30:30,585
If my grandma had seen me sing pop,

1030
01:30:30,752 --> 01:30:32,543
she'd have clobbered me.

1031
01:34:21,335 --> 01:34:24,002
Subtitles:
Lenny Borger & Cynthia Schoch

1032
