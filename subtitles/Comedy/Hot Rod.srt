1
00:00:40,507 --> 00:00:43,476
Kevin. Did we reinforce
the take-off ramp?

2
00:00:43,743 --> 00:00:45,438
Nah, we didn't have time.

3
00:00:47,313 --> 00:00:48,610
Cool.

4
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:59,317
Soul of an eagle.

5
00:01:15,842 --> 00:01:17,002
Oh, shit.

6
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:21,046
Are you okay?

7
00:02:17,537 --> 00:02:18,936
What's up, little riders?

8
00:02:19,038 --> 00:02:23,134
I'm jumping the public pool tomorrow.
2 bucks. Tell your friends.

9
00:02:29,249 --> 00:02:31,149
Eat some smoke!

10
00:02:31,751 --> 00:02:33,514
That's just a sample.

11
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:35,619
See you there.

12
00:02:48,868 --> 00:02:49,960
Pink grapefruit.

13
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:51,195
Yes.

14
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:57,176
-Toasted marshmallow.
-Yes.

15
00:02:57,377 --> 00:02:58,776
Finish her off.

16
00:03:02,482 --> 00:03:03,813
Raspberry?

17
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:06,042
Psych! Very Cherry.

18
00:03:06,152 --> 00:03:07,278
A hundred straight.

19
00:03:09,322 --> 00:03:11,290
I'm gonna go drop some dumpage.

20
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:14,456
-Voltron?
-That's me.

21
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:17,496
-Hi, Dave.
-How you doing, Cathy?

22
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:19,130
Why'd you call yourself Voltron?

23
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:22,360
I don't know.
Maybe 'cause it's super badass.

24
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:26,270
-You're weird.
-Hells, yeah, I am.

25
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:27,430
Yoo-hoo, shitheads.

26
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,633
I just found a bag of fireworks
in the men's restroom.

27
00:03:29,742 --> 00:03:31,141
Would you guys like to light them off?

28
00:03:31,244 --> 00:03:33,542
All right, boys. Prepare to be dazzled.

29
00:03:47,493 --> 00:03:48,687
Jumping the pool tomorrow!

30
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:08,278
God damn. Rod!

31
00:04:09,882 --> 00:04:12,009
Mom? Have you seen my hip pads?

32
00:04:12,118 --> 00:04:13,380
In the kitchen.

33
00:04:13,486 --> 00:04:15,078
Rod, maybe you shouldn't fight Frank
this week.

34
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:17,088
You know, you could rest up
for the jump tomorrow.

35
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:21,183
Relax, Kev. I'm gonna win this time.
I did, like, 40 crunches yesterday.

36
00:04:21,294 --> 00:04:23,228
What is it with you two, anyway?

37
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:24,796
You wouldn't understand, Kevin.

38
00:04:24,897 --> 00:04:26,956
He's your real dad
so he automatically loves you.

39
00:04:27,066 --> 00:04:29,762
But he's my stepdad. I have to earn it.

40
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:35,841
Ancestors, protect me

41
00:04:36,342 --> 00:04:38,936
May they protect you

42
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:46,083
Frank?

43
00:04:51,557 --> 00:04:52,751
Frank.

44
00:04:56,696 --> 00:04:57,856
Frank!

45
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:02,097
Never sneak up on a man
who's been in a chemical fire.

46
00:05:02,201 --> 00:05:03,998
-Sorry.
-On your feet.

47
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:08,433
What's this?

48
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:12,204
Rhodesian fighting sticks.
Very, very lethal.

49
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,939
Rhodesian. Of course.

50
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:18,445
Come on.

51
00:05:20,887 --> 00:05:23,355
You are pathetic!

52
00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:24,923
Stop, stop, I give up! I give up!

53
00:05:25,024 --> 00:05:26,286
Yeah.

54
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:31,429
No, Frank!

55
00:05:34,867 --> 00:05:37,665
Play the victim,
and you will be the victim.

56
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:40,036
Very good, Frank.

57
00:05:40,873 --> 00:05:43,364
Very impressive. Ultimate punch!

58
00:05:48,214 --> 00:05:50,341
I'm gonna knock
that ridiculous mustache

59
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:52,008
right off your face.

60
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:54,846
All great men have mustaches, Frank.

61
00:05:56,055 --> 00:05:57,716
Yeah, but real men actually grow them.

62
00:05:57,824 --> 00:05:59,951
You know I have a hormone disorder!

63
00:06:05,498 --> 00:06:06,863
You'll see, Frank.

64
00:06:06,966 --> 00:06:10,197
One day, I'll punch you right in the face,
and then you'll respect me.

65
00:06:10,303 --> 00:06:13,033
I'll believe it when I see it, muchacho.

66
00:06:15,808 --> 00:06:17,742
Take out the trash.

67
00:06:34,827 --> 00:06:36,226
Nailed it.

68
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:40,660
Rod?

69
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:45,332
-Denise!
-Hey!

70
00:06:46,606 --> 00:06:47,698
How's it going?

71
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:48,774
Oh.

72
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:51,874
Great. Everything's going super great.

73
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:54,503
You look different.

74
00:06:54,614 --> 00:06:57,640
Oh, really? Well, it's been a while.

75
00:06:58,217 --> 00:06:59,548
You look...

76
00:06:59,652 --> 00:07:01,449
You look pretty much exactly the same.

77
00:07:02,155 --> 00:07:03,850
Yeah. Thanks.

78
00:07:03,956 --> 00:07:05,651
And I see you're still doing your stunts.

79
00:07:06,192 --> 00:07:07,318
Big time.

80
00:07:08,327 --> 00:07:09,760
Actually...

81
00:07:09,862 --> 00:07:12,092
Here. Peep the strategy.

82
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:16,266
You're jumping the pool? Wow!

83
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:18,803
Yeah, it's the real deal.
You should come.

84
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:20,998
Maybe I will. Thanks.

85
00:07:21,207 --> 00:07:22,174
Cool.

86
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:30,142
Well, I gotta go. I gotta feed Buddy,
but very nice to see you, Rod.

87
00:07:30,249 --> 00:07:31,739
Yeah, you too.

88
00:07:33,653 --> 00:07:35,018
You look pretty.

89
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:36,247
What did you say?

90
00:07:36,355 --> 00:07:39,415
I said you look shitty.
Good night, Denise.

91
00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:04,676
Hey, Pop.

92
00:08:05,017 --> 00:08:06,416
It's me, Rod.

93
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09,149
I sure wish you were alive.

94
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:11,285
You'd tell me how much you respect me

95
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:15,053
and we'd do stunts
and grow mustaches together.

96
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:18,993
You may have died
an anonymous stuntman,

97
00:08:19,098 --> 00:08:21,498
but you live on through me.

98
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:27,700
I miss you, Daddy.

99
00:08:28,941 --> 00:08:29,999
Hey, Rod?

100
00:08:30,109 --> 00:08:31,633
Get out!

101
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:38,146
All right, everybody,
let's clear the pool.

102
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:40,276
There's gonna be a jump.

103
00:08:40,386 --> 00:08:44,083
Come on, seriously, guys.
It's gonna be pretty amazing.

104
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:47,250
Okeydoke, Rod. It's regulation size.

105
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,256
Thanks, Rico.
Hey, have you seen Kevin anywhere?

106
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:51,663
He's not here.

107
00:08:51,764 --> 00:08:53,391
What do you mean he's not here?
He's team manager.

108
00:08:53,499 --> 00:08:55,626
-He has to be here.
-I know, right?

109
00:09:00,239 --> 00:09:02,730
Richardson, out of the pool. Let's go.

110
00:09:02,842 --> 00:09:04,002
No can do, Dave.

111
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:06,271
Come on, Richardson.
You're being a tool, man.

112
00:09:06,612 --> 00:09:09,604
There is no tool in this pool.

113
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:13,617
And I'd happily get out,
if you let me join your crew.

114
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:17,451
You can't join the crew, Richardson.
You don't do anything.

115
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:18,614
Oh, don't l?

116
00:09:31,504 --> 00:09:32,630
You like what you see?

117
00:09:35,007 --> 00:09:35,996
Hey.

118
00:09:36,108 --> 00:09:37,370
Denise. Hey.

119
00:09:37,476 --> 00:09:40,206
Looks exciting.
Is there anything I can do to help?

120
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:41,871
Oh, no, it's cool.

121
00:09:42,815 --> 00:09:43,941
Stop it!

122
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:46,575
I think my crew's got it
pretty much covered.

123
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,812
So...

124
00:09:51,857 --> 00:09:54,690
-Good luck.
-Don't worry, Denise.

125
00:09:55,828 --> 00:09:57,455
I've done this before.

126
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:20,442
Totem spirit, fox.

127
00:10:35,267 --> 00:10:38,293
Please, God, don't let me
embarrass myself in front of Denise.

128
00:10:59,091 --> 00:11:00,422
Hello?

129
00:11:00,726 --> 00:11:01,988
I'm home.

130
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:03,788
Kevin?

131
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:06,227
You missed the jump.

132
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:07,823
I totally landed it.

133
00:11:15,975 --> 00:11:18,443
Rod, thank goodness you're home.

134
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:22,275
What's going on? Is this some sort of
interactive theater art piece?

135
00:11:22,381 --> 00:11:25,077
It's Frank. He's very sick.

136
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:26,742
What? Since when?

137
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:28,786
Since 21 years ago.

138
00:11:29,221 --> 00:11:30,813
It's his heart.

139
00:11:30,923 --> 00:11:34,017
He needs a transplant,
and our insurance won't cover it.

140
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:37,863
They say he's too high-risk. Oh, Rod.

141
00:11:37,963 --> 00:11:39,931
He doesn't have much time left.

142
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:41,891
No way.

143
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:45,459
We would've told you sooner, but
we knew how much it would upset you.

144
00:11:45,571 --> 00:11:47,801
So, you just decided to keep me
and Kevin in the dark?

145
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:52,299
Oh, no, we told Kevin.
We just didn't think you could handle it.

146
00:11:52,845 --> 00:11:54,813
I can handle it.

147
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:58,643
I love you, Kevin.
I want you to have my watch.

148
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:00,749
I love you, too, Dad.

149
00:12:00,853 --> 00:12:02,480
Hold on, Frank! Don't die!

150
00:12:02,855 --> 00:12:04,482
Let's let them talk.

151
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:06,057
Sorry, boy. My time's up.

152
00:12:06,158 --> 00:12:08,991
But I still need to kick your ass.
How can I do that if you're dead?

153
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:11,962
Well, then,
I guess I'll die still champion.

154
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:15,192
No way. Let's do it right now.
One more for the road.

155
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:18,737
Beating me wouldn't mean
anything now. I'm all through.

156
00:12:18,838 --> 00:12:22,433
All I want is to earn your respect, Frank.
How can I do that if you won't fight me?

157
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:24,475
Well, maybe you should've
thought of that

158
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,545
before you sucked at being a man
all your life.

159
00:12:26,645 --> 00:12:30,945
Oh, my God. I hate you so much,
I just wanna smash your face in.

160
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:33,348
Too late. I'm a dead man.

161
00:12:34,987 --> 00:12:36,318
What about the transplant?

162
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:39,482
Oh, sure. 50 grand.
You gonna pay for it?

163
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,423
-No!
-'Course you're not.

164
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:43,722
Let's face it. You're a kid.

165
00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:46,297
You live at home. You got no job.

166
00:12:46,398 --> 00:12:49,890
All you're good for is goofing around
with your friends on your moped.

167
00:12:50,002 --> 00:12:53,836
You're wrong, Frank. I'm not a kid.
I'm a man.

168
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:57,466
I am gonna get you better.
And then I'm gonna beat you to death!

169
00:12:57,943 --> 00:12:59,308
You couldn't beat a drum.

170
00:13:01,981 --> 00:13:05,075
-Rod, are you okay?
-I need to go to my quiet place!

171
00:14:23,295 --> 00:14:24,284
Shit!

172
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:17,011
Oh, my God!

173
00:15:47,746 --> 00:15:49,270
And that is how it's done.

174
00:15:49,381 --> 00:15:50,609
Wow.

175
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:51,939
It's amazing.

176
00:15:52,051 --> 00:15:53,109
That really hurt.

177
00:15:53,218 --> 00:15:55,277
Okay, you guys. Thanks for meeting me.

178
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:58,654
As you all know, I recently found out
that my stepfather, Frank,

179
00:15:58,757 --> 00:16:00,748
is on his deathbed.

180
00:16:00,859 --> 00:16:05,262
I needed to think last night,
so I galloped into a wooded glen.

181
00:16:05,831 --> 00:16:07,799
And after punch-dancing out my rage

182
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:11,301
and suffering an extremely long
and very painful fall,

183
00:16:12,771 --> 00:16:15,069
I realized what has to be done.

184
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:19,302
We're gonna raise the money
to save Frank's life.

185
00:16:19,411 --> 00:16:20,878
Well, that's awesome, Rod,

186
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,847
but how exactly
do you plan on doing that?

187
00:16:23,949 --> 00:16:25,610
One big jump, gentlemen.

188
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:28,749
The biggest jump this town's ever seen.

189
00:16:28,854 --> 00:16:30,549
We're gonna jump 15 buses.

190
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,283
Whoa. Come on, Rod.

191
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:34,882
That's nearly as many
as Evel Knievel jumped.

192
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:38,555
It's actually one more
than Evel Knievel jumped, Rico. I know.

193
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:40,859
I checked. Online.

194
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,799
Now, I've gotta be in top physical form
if we're gonna do this jump.

195
00:16:44,903 --> 00:16:46,734
-I'm sorry, Dave.
-What's that?

196
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:47,965
Where are you going?

197
00:16:48,073 --> 00:16:52,100
I'm sorry, man. I just realized,
I'm late for work at the ice rink.

198
00:16:52,277 --> 00:16:54,302
-So, is that a problem?
-Yes.

199
00:16:54,413 --> 00:16:57,007
Now, this jump demands
that I be in top physical condition.

200
00:16:57,116 --> 00:16:59,107
I've already drafted
a rough schedule of exercises

201
00:16:59,218 --> 00:17:01,152
that will help us take things
to the next level.

202
00:17:01,253 --> 00:17:04,154
Once training is complete, we'll turn
our attention to funding the jump.

203
00:17:04,256 --> 00:17:07,225
By my estimations,
we'll need to raise around $5,000.

204
00:17:07,326 --> 00:17:09,123
That includes bus rentals,
ramp construction,

205
00:17:09,228 --> 00:17:10,456
team hats and wrist bands,

206
00:17:10,562 --> 00:17:12,291
and a $9 per diem
for each crew member.

207
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:13,456
Now you're talking.

208
00:17:13,565 --> 00:17:15,362
We're gonna have to raise money fast.

209
00:17:15,467 --> 00:17:18,265
I'll drum up small-scale stunt work
at birthday parties.

210
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,565
We're talking escape tricks,
fire breathing.

211
00:17:20,672 --> 00:17:22,333
Anything to please the rug rats.

212
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:26,138
Also, we're gonna have to organize a
lot of shopping carts.

213
00:17:26,245 --> 00:17:30,909
And we're gonna go through some trash
for cans and newspaper to sleep on.

214
00:17:31,016 --> 00:17:33,211
Hey! What are you guys doing?

215
00:17:35,287 --> 00:17:36,413
Rod.

216
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:39,457
Once we've raised the money,
we'll use it to put on the bus jump,

217
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:42,550
make $50,000, and save Frank's life.

218
00:17:42,661 --> 00:17:43,787
Now, who's with me?

219
00:17:45,798 --> 00:17:47,095
Let's celebrate.

220
00:17:58,477 --> 00:18:00,001
Buddy. Come on.

221
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:11,446
Hey, Rod.

222
00:18:13,892 --> 00:18:14,859
Oh.

223
00:18:15,527 --> 00:18:16,926
Denise, what's up?

224
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:18,189
Not much.

225
00:18:19,298 --> 00:18:20,595
Funky fresh.

226
00:18:20,699 --> 00:18:23,896
I heard about your plan to save Frank.
I think that's great.

227
00:18:24,002 --> 00:18:28,336
Oh, yeah. I'm mainly just doing that
so I can kick his ass.

228
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,702
Right.

229
00:18:29,808 --> 00:18:32,641
So, Denise, I think I know
why you came over here.

230
00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:35,040
-You do?
-Yeah.

231
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:38,212
You wanna join my crew.

232
00:18:40,185 --> 00:18:42,881
I can't lie. I think it's a great idea.

233
00:18:43,388 --> 00:18:45,549
We could use someone
with your college experience.

234
00:18:45,657 --> 00:18:50,151
-Cool. I'd love to join.
-Whoa, whoa, Denise. Slow down.

235
00:18:50,262 --> 00:18:54,790
You can't just waltz in off the street
and demand to be in my crew.

236
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:59,394
-But I thought you...
-Yeah, I know what you thought.

237
00:19:00,739 --> 00:19:04,766
But the fact is you can't join
until you go through initiation.

238
00:19:05,944 --> 00:19:07,468
All right. What's the initiation?

239
00:19:09,047 --> 00:19:10,480
It's crazy.

240
00:19:10,582 --> 00:19:13,745
It's like the craziest thing
you could even imagine.

241
00:19:13,852 --> 00:19:15,217
Okay.

242
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,685
Here we go.

243
00:19:19,091 --> 00:19:20,752
Rod! Rod.

244
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:21,951
Welcome aboard.

245
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:24,654
I'm kind of grumpy today, dude.
I didn't get a lot of sleep last night.

246
00:19:24,763 --> 00:19:27,095
I was having those dreams again.

247
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:31,226
You know how it's just me in a castle.
I gotta fight, like, a thousand wizards.

248
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:34,271
The only way to beat them is to punch
them as hard as I can in their faces.

249
00:19:34,373 --> 00:19:37,171
And then, when I'm done,
all their little wizard wives came out

250
00:19:37,276 --> 00:19:39,176
and wanted me
just to have sex with them.

251
00:19:39,278 --> 00:19:40,472
Which is kind of weird.

252
00:19:40,579 --> 00:19:42,240
Hey, look at this, huh?

253
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:45,111
Hey, everybody.
I've got some awesome news.

254
00:19:45,217 --> 00:19:47,913
We have a new crew member today.
Denise.

255
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,419
Hi, everyone.

256
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:51,079
So, I thought it'd be fun
if we all went around

257
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,385
and said our name
and a little something about ourselves.

258
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:56,518
I'll start. My name is Rod,

259
00:19:56,628 --> 00:19:58,391
and I like to party.

260
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:01,158
All right, Dave. You're up.

261
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:04,099
Hi. My name is Dave,

262
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:06,899
and I like to party.

263
00:20:07,506 --> 00:20:10,771
No, Dave. I just said that I party, so
maybe do something different from me.

264
00:20:11,677 --> 00:20:15,306
My name is Dave,
and I am the stunt man.

265
00:20:15,414 --> 00:20:18,008
You know what? Let's move on.
Rico, you're up.

266
00:20:18,784 --> 00:20:21,878
Hello. I'm Rico, and I like to party.

267
00:20:21,987 --> 00:20:24,717
Yeah. Rico?
What did I just say to Dave?

268
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:26,014
-Who?
-Dave.

269
00:20:26,124 --> 00:20:28,388
-I like to party. I'm Rod.
-No. You're Kevin.

270
00:20:28,493 --> 00:20:30,620
Right. Kevin. I party.

271
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:33,721
No. No, you don't.
Okay, nobody parties but me.

272
00:20:33,832 --> 00:20:35,697
Yes. And we party.

273
00:20:35,801 --> 00:20:37,098
-No.
-Yeah, just Rod.

274
00:20:37,202 --> 00:20:38,294
-Yes.
-And me.

275
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:41,861
-No! I'm the only one who parties.
-I'm pretty sure I've partied before.

276
00:20:41,974 --> 00:20:45,137
No, Kevin, I know for a fact
you don't party, okay? You do not party.

277
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,678
-You're right. Dave's the party guy.
-Sweet.

278
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:51,340
Oh, my God. Shut up, okay?
I'm just gonna do it for you.

279
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:53,850
Denise. This is the crew.

280
00:20:53,952 --> 00:20:56,443
Dave's the mechanic.
Rico makes the ramps.

281
00:20:56,555 --> 00:20:58,682
And Kevin is
team manager/videographer.

282
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:00,815
None of them party. Right?

283
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,025
Got it?

284
00:21:03,128 --> 00:21:04,220
Okay.

285
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:06,729
Let's party.

286
00:21:07,366 --> 00:21:10,358
Pools are perfect
for holding water, man.

287
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:15,237
Man, I don't really know about having
a girl on the team, man.

288
00:21:16,141 --> 00:21:17,836
All right, Rico, listen.

289
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:22,004
There's an ancient ltalian maxim
that roughly translates to,

290
00:21:22,714 --> 00:21:27,515
"He who is resistant to change
is destined to perish."

291
00:21:28,086 --> 00:21:30,611
So, why don't you try to open up
that mind of yours? You know?

292
00:21:30,722 --> 00:21:33,054
It's like, look at Kevin. I mean, he...

293
00:21:33,825 --> 00:21:34,883
Real mature, man.

294
00:21:34,993 --> 00:21:36,961
Yeah, don't you ever tell me
how to live my life again.

295
00:21:39,665 --> 00:21:40,757
Okay, you guys.

296
00:21:40,866 --> 00:21:44,495
If I'm gonna jump 15 buses, my body's
gonna have to be in top physical form.

297
00:21:44,603 --> 00:21:47,697
Which brings us to our first exercise.
Lung strengthening.

298
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:50,172
You guys are gonna hold me
under water for 40 seconds.

299
00:21:50,275 --> 00:21:51,970
That's 20 less than a minute.

300
00:21:52,077 --> 00:21:54,272
My body's natural instinct
is gonna be to resist.

301
00:21:54,379 --> 00:21:57,246
But, no matter what, don't let up.

302
00:21:57,349 --> 00:22:00,716
If there's any problem at all,
I will ring this bell.

303
00:22:23,709 --> 00:22:26,234
Hey, Dave. Mom wants to know
if your friends want some grape punch.

304
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:29,405
Maggie! Don't even ask. Just bring it.
Come on.

305
00:22:30,449 --> 00:22:33,418
Don't just stare at me! Go! Thank you.

306
00:22:37,589 --> 00:22:39,853
Soul of a bottlenose dolphin.

307
00:22:58,243 --> 00:22:59,267
Hey, y'all.

308
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:02,438
Mom said there wasn't enough grape,
so it's mixed with cherry. Is that okay?

309
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:04,538
Yeah, fine, Maggie. Put it on the table.

310
00:23:04,649 --> 00:23:05,673
Which table?

311
00:23:05,784 --> 00:23:08,344
You tell me, Brainiac.
It's your front yard, too.

312
00:23:08,453 --> 00:23:12,253
Hey, little girl! I don't want cherry.
It upsets my stomach!

313
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:17,660
37, 38, 39, 40. Okay. Let him up.

314
00:23:19,831 --> 00:23:22,459
Get him out, get him out, get him out!

315
00:23:23,468 --> 00:23:25,026
Get him up, get him up.

316
00:23:28,507 --> 00:23:30,236
Rod, can you hear me?
Can you hear me?

317
00:23:30,342 --> 00:23:32,003
Come on, Rod.

318
00:23:37,883 --> 00:23:39,077
-Nice.
-Oh, God.

319
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:42,384
-Oh, man.
-What happened?

320
00:23:42,487 --> 00:23:44,978
You almost drowned. Denise just gave
you mouth-to-mouth and saved you.

321
00:23:48,894 --> 00:23:50,885
Did it look like we were making out?

322
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:53,161
A little bit.

323
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:54,493
Awesome.

324
00:23:56,368 --> 00:23:57,562
Are you okay?

325
00:23:58,503 --> 00:24:00,869
Oh. Hey, Denise. What's up?

326
00:24:00,972 --> 00:24:03,964
Great. I'm just gonna go wash off
this puke from my face.

327
00:24:04,075 --> 00:24:05,064
Cool.

328
00:24:07,979 --> 00:24:09,606
Speed management.

329
00:24:09,981 --> 00:24:11,243
G force.

330
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:13,240
Let's run it.

331
00:24:19,191 --> 00:24:21,386
My safe word will be whiskey.

332
00:24:22,027 --> 00:24:23,790
Sorry, Rod. What was that?

333
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:25,725
Whiskey.

334
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:27,325
Don't you mean whiskey?

335
00:24:28,033 --> 00:24:29,057
What?

336
00:24:29,167 --> 00:24:31,328
-You're saying it weird.
-Saying what weird?

337
00:24:31,436 --> 00:24:32,425
All of it.

338
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:35,868
Where do you get off?

339
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:37,703
I just don't get
why you're saying it that way.

340
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:39,902
Why I'm saying what what way?

341
00:24:40,011 --> 00:24:42,741
-Forget it.
-I will. I will forget it.

342
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:47,118
Denise. Would you kindly clear
the wheels?

343
00:24:50,522 --> 00:24:52,786
Okay, here we go. On three.

344
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:54,818
One,

345
00:24:55,694 --> 00:24:57,525
-two...
-Whoa, whiskey!

346
00:24:57,629 --> 00:24:59,119
Whiskey!

347
00:24:59,231 --> 00:25:01,859
Whiskey!

348
00:25:01,967 --> 00:25:03,594
Whiskey!

349
00:25:03,702 --> 00:25:05,761
Whiskey!

350
00:25:07,239 --> 00:25:08,570
Oh, shit!

351
00:25:12,477 --> 00:25:13,603
Rod!

352
00:25:14,212 --> 00:25:15,372
Are you okay?

353
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,141
The safety word didn't help.

354
00:25:17,249 --> 00:25:18,614
My trailer! What the hell?

355
00:25:18,717 --> 00:25:21,447
One of you is getting
your dick-hole smashed!

356
00:25:25,257 --> 00:25:29,353
I'm freaking pumped! I've been drinking
green tea all goddamn day!

357
00:25:29,728 --> 00:25:30,695
Oh!

358
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:33,023
Man, he hit his ass
with a parking cone. Nice!

359
00:25:33,131 --> 00:25:35,827
God, I go to church
every goddamn Sunday!

360
00:25:35,934 --> 00:25:37,265
You gonna bring the demons out of me!

361
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:38,734
-All right, Rico. You got him.
-Rico.

362
00:25:38,837 --> 00:25:41,601
Not with the trash can, buddy.
No, no, come on.

363
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:44,106
-Trash!
-All right, let's get him off of him.

364
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:46,575
-Okay, okay, okay.
-No, no. No!

365
00:25:47,846 --> 00:25:49,643
This is my hat, now.

366
00:25:49,748 --> 00:25:51,875
This is totally my hat.

367
00:26:00,458 --> 00:26:01,789
Thanks.

368
00:26:04,129 --> 00:26:07,326
So, how do you like
being in the crew so far?

369
00:26:07,966 --> 00:26:10,730
-It's been interesting.
-Told you.

370
00:26:13,838 --> 00:26:15,066
Stop it.

371
00:26:17,208 --> 00:26:18,607
Hey, Denise?

372
00:26:20,178 --> 00:26:22,169
There's something I wanted to ask you.

373
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,406
Yeah?

374
00:26:24,349 --> 00:26:25,577
Well...

375
00:26:26,651 --> 00:26:30,280
I couldn't help but notice
that we've both matured a lot,

376
00:26:30,722 --> 00:26:32,087
physically.

377
00:26:33,224 --> 00:26:36,125
And I was just wondering if maybe...

378
00:26:36,227 --> 00:26:38,092
Hey, Rod. What's that song called,

379
00:26:38,196 --> 00:26:39,857
about the grandma
getting run over by a reindeer?

380
00:26:41,299 --> 00:26:44,200
Grandma Got Run Over
by a Reindeer?

381
00:26:44,302 --> 00:26:45,530
No.

382
00:26:47,138 --> 00:26:48,901
Jonathan.

383
00:26:51,643 --> 00:26:53,804
Hey, what are you doing?
I thought you were at work.

384
00:26:53,912 --> 00:26:56,676
Wanted to come by
and surprise my little girl.

385
00:26:59,384 --> 00:27:00,783
Hey, guys.

386
00:27:00,885 --> 00:27:03,319
This is Jonathan.
He's visiting from the city.

387
00:27:03,421 --> 00:27:05,389
-What's up, fellas?
-I'm gonna grab my jacket.

388
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:06,457
Okay.

389
00:27:11,396 --> 00:27:12,795
So, what are you supposed to be?

390
00:27:13,898 --> 00:27:15,331
A stuntman.

391
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:18,797
How about you, precious?

392
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:21,901
I'm a team manager.

393
00:27:24,109 --> 00:27:25,235
Wow.

394
00:27:26,745 --> 00:27:28,042
Ready.

395
00:27:28,346 --> 00:27:30,007
Have a nice day, guys.

396
00:27:30,715 --> 00:27:31,682
Bye.

397
00:27:31,916 --> 00:27:35,079
Oh. Rod, what were you gonna ask me?

398
00:27:35,186 --> 00:27:37,245
Oh, right.

399
00:27:37,355 --> 00:27:40,256
I was going to ask you
who you think would win

400
00:27:40,358 --> 00:27:44,761
in a fight between
a grilled cheese sandwich

401
00:27:45,263 --> 00:27:47,231
and a taco.

402
00:27:49,467 --> 00:27:51,435
Is that really what you were gonna ask?

403
00:27:51,536 --> 00:27:52,594
Yes.

404
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,635
Grilled cheese. But only in a fair fight.

405
00:27:57,742 --> 00:28:00,040
If it's prison rules, I'd take the taco.

406
00:28:00,145 --> 00:28:04,445
Wow. That's pretty racist, but correct.

407
00:28:04,549 --> 00:28:06,483
I'll see you guys.

408
00:28:18,263 --> 00:28:20,424
You know what car is super-overrated?

409
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:22,591
-What?
-Corvette.

410
00:28:23,501 --> 00:28:25,128
You mean, like the one
Jonathan was driving?

411
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:28,832
Is that what he was driving?

412
00:28:29,808 --> 00:28:31,708
Must've been what reminded me.

413
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:34,176
I don't know,
I thought it was kind of cool.

414
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:36,873
Okay, boys. Now, this is the first time

415
00:28:36,981 --> 00:28:40,007
your father's feeling well enough
to sit with us at the dinner table.

416
00:28:40,118 --> 00:28:44,646
So I want everyone to promise me,
no fighting.

417
00:28:46,191 --> 00:28:48,716
What're you looking at me for?
Kevin could fight him.

418
00:28:48,827 --> 00:28:50,954
-I promise not to fight him.
-Thank you, Kevin.

419
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:52,689
-Rod?
-Fine, I promise.

420
00:28:52,797 --> 00:28:53,855
Thank you.

421
00:28:55,834 --> 00:28:56,926
Hi, Kevin.

422
00:28:57,035 --> 00:28:58,195
Hey, Dad.

423
00:28:58,303 --> 00:29:00,464
Thank you, dear.

424
00:29:02,373 --> 00:29:03,533
Frank.

425
00:29:08,646 --> 00:29:10,079
So, Frank.

426
00:29:10,181 --> 00:29:13,082
I'm sure you've heard the plan
to get you a new heart is going great.

427
00:29:13,184 --> 00:29:14,378
Nope.

428
00:29:14,486 --> 00:29:15,919
Well, it is.

429
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:17,612
You can say thanks, if you wanted.

430
00:29:17,722 --> 00:29:19,349
No, I'm good.

431
00:29:20,959 --> 00:29:22,790
I know what you're doing, Frank.

432
00:29:22,894 --> 00:29:24,862
You're trying to make me lose
my temper.

433
00:29:24,963 --> 00:29:27,022
But it's not gonna happen.

434
00:29:27,132 --> 00:29:30,363
I'm afraid cooler heads have prevailed.

435
00:29:30,869 --> 00:29:32,496
You're the devil!

436
00:29:33,805 --> 00:29:35,363
All right! That's enough.

437
00:29:35,473 --> 00:29:37,100
Frank, back to bed.

438
00:29:37,208 --> 00:29:38,732
Rod, outside.

439
00:29:38,843 --> 00:29:39,969
Fine.

440
00:29:40,512 --> 00:29:42,139
Have fun being married to Satan!

441
00:30:08,673 --> 00:30:10,163
Nice work, Rico!

442
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:26,584
So, Denise. Tell me about Jonathan.
What's that dude all about?

443
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:30,419
Well, we've been going out
for about a year.

444
00:30:30,728 --> 00:30:33,128
-And it's going well?
-Yeah. Yeah.

445
00:30:33,264 --> 00:30:36,461
I mean, every relationship has
its ups and downs, but...

446
00:30:36,568 --> 00:30:38,195
Right. I've heard that.

447
00:30:38,303 --> 00:30:40,271
And he's a nice guy?

448
00:30:40,371 --> 00:30:42,896
Oh, yeah. I mean, he's really smart.

449
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:46,170
He's actually in line to become
a junior partner at his law firm.

450
00:30:46,277 --> 00:30:49,075
Right. Totally.
You guys should break up.

451
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:51,307
-What?
-Nothing. Hey, Dave's back.

452
00:30:51,416 --> 00:30:54,385
You guys, the bathroom here is nuts.

453
00:30:58,756 --> 00:31:00,087
What do I owe you?

454
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:02,250
$7.25.

455
00:31:30,288 --> 00:31:31,721
So,

456
00:31:33,124 --> 00:31:34,148
hi.

457
00:31:34,259 --> 00:31:36,659
$2.39's your change. Thank you.

458
00:31:37,929 --> 00:31:40,796
We don't talk much, do we?
Cathy, was it?

459
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:43,492
I'm Rod. I do awesome stunts.

460
00:31:43,601 --> 00:31:46,536
All the time, with my friends.
You probably didn't know that.

461
00:31:46,638 --> 00:31:49,402
And you probably have lots of cool stuff
about you that I don't know.

462
00:31:49,507 --> 00:31:52,135
The point is, if you don't sit down
with someone and really talk

463
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:54,040
and get to know them,
you never find those things out.

464
00:31:54,779 --> 00:31:58,340
So, what do you say?
You wanna make this thing official?

465
00:31:58,449 --> 00:32:00,349
Are you asking me out?

466
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:05,245
Oh, Cathy!

467
00:32:09,994 --> 00:32:11,825
Wow, Rod. I can't believe she said yes.

468
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:15,627
Yeah, well, you have only to believe if
you wish to achieve, Kevin.

469
00:32:15,733 --> 00:32:17,530
That rhymed. Unintentional.

470
00:32:17,635 --> 00:32:21,799
Man, Rod. I am just green
with jealous rage right now.

471
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:24,199
-She's really pretty.
-I know, D.

472
00:32:24,309 --> 00:32:27,301
But it's more than that with Cathy.
It's emotional.

473
00:32:27,412 --> 00:32:29,107
She really gets me.

474
00:32:29,213 --> 00:32:31,579
Tell you what. Why don't you grab
that brainy beau of yours

475
00:32:31,683 --> 00:32:33,446
and we'll make it a double date.

476
00:32:33,551 --> 00:32:34,540
Really?

477
00:32:34,652 --> 00:32:37,416
-Sure.
-Okay. That sounds like fun.

478
00:32:37,522 --> 00:32:41,117
Great, because I also think
it sounds like fun.

479
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:42,685
A lot.

480
00:32:52,437 --> 00:32:53,734
Frank.

481
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:56,600
I know you're sleeping,

482
00:32:56,708 --> 00:33:00,769
but I just wanted you to know
that training is going really great.

483
00:33:01,946 --> 00:33:03,937
My reflexes are sharp.

484
00:33:05,049 --> 00:33:07,040
I'm crazy agile.

485
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:10,181
And I have a date.

486
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:15,318
So, anyways, that's the update.

487
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:18,656
Sleep tight.

488
00:33:20,264 --> 00:33:22,164
Who are you talking to?

489
00:33:24,469 --> 00:33:27,302
Oh, when you're going on a date

490
00:33:27,405 --> 00:33:29,032
You put on a shirt

491
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:33,372
And you drive your bike to the date

492
00:33:41,085 --> 00:33:43,485
Looks like you got stood up, huh?

493
00:33:44,055 --> 00:33:45,682
No, she's coming.

494
00:33:46,057 --> 00:33:47,149
Okay.

495
00:33:47,725 --> 00:33:49,283
Hey, guys, can I take your order?

496
00:33:49,394 --> 00:33:50,793
No, we're actually waiting for...

497
00:33:50,895 --> 00:33:53,159
Yeah, we'll take
three Flaming Dr. Peppers.

498
00:33:53,264 --> 00:33:54,322
Okay.

499
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:55,865
So, Super Dave.

500
00:33:55,967 --> 00:33:58,663
Denise tells me you're working on
some pretty big-time stuff.

501
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:01,500
Yeah, well, I been doing stunts
since I was a kid,

502
00:34:01,606 --> 00:34:03,904
so it's not really a big deal to me.

503
00:34:04,008 --> 00:34:05,908
Yeah, me neither.
I was just being polite.

504
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:07,637
But thanks for letting me off the hook.

505
00:34:07,745 --> 00:34:08,803
Jonathan.

506
00:34:08,913 --> 00:34:09,937
Here we go.

507
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,640
Oh, speak of diablo.

508
00:34:11,749 --> 00:34:13,614
Bombs away.

509
00:34:18,022 --> 00:34:20,752
Boom! There's the flavor!

510
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:28,958
So, how's your mom holding up, Rod?

511
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:31,934
Oh, pretty good, I guess.

512
00:34:32,036 --> 00:34:34,766
I mean, sometimes I think
she's really sad.

513
00:34:34,872 --> 00:34:38,035
Holy shit, is that Sullivan? Sully!

514
00:34:38,142 --> 00:34:40,440
-Bro, no way!
-No way, Sully.

515
00:34:40,545 --> 00:34:42,206
Babe, I gotta say "what up" to Sullivan.

516
00:34:42,313 --> 00:34:43,439
-Okay.
-Sweet.

517
00:34:43,548 --> 00:34:46,984
Hey. Don't you two go falling in love
while I'm gone.

518
00:34:48,352 --> 00:34:49,580
Like that'll happen.

519
00:34:49,687 --> 00:34:52,952
Sullivan, you chode!
I owe you a shot to the nuts!

520
00:34:56,527 --> 00:34:59,121
Maybe you should call her, Rod.
Just check in.

521
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:02,927
Nah. She hates it
when I try and keep tabs on her. So...

522
00:35:09,841 --> 00:35:11,274
Hey, Denise?

523
00:35:11,375 --> 00:35:13,605
Have I ever showed you a picture
of my dead dad?

524
00:35:13,711 --> 00:35:15,975
-No.
-Oh, you've gotta see it.

525
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,570
He's super dead.

526
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:22,976
-That's him?
-Yeah.

527
00:35:23,855 --> 00:35:25,516
He looks so nice.

528
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:27,084
He was a stuntman?

529
00:35:27,191 --> 00:35:28,920
Oh, yeah.

530
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:33,424
He used to work for Evel Knievel,
testing his bikes before big jumps.

531
00:35:33,531 --> 00:35:35,226
He would do the jumps first,
to make sure they were safe

532
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:38,427
and then let Evel come in
and get all the glory.

533
00:35:39,537 --> 00:35:41,266
And, after a while, the old man said,

534
00:35:41,372 --> 00:35:44,535
"To hell with that.
I want the credit I deserve."

535
00:35:45,576 --> 00:35:49,239
So, one afternoon,
he set out to jump ten milk trucks.

536
00:35:50,281 --> 00:35:54,980
He nailed the takeoff, but when he
landed, something terrible happened.

537
00:35:55,953 --> 00:35:58,683
His front tire exploded like a cannonball

538
00:35:58,789 --> 00:36:01,986
and his handlebars went
straight through his head.

539
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:04,123
Blood was everywhere.

540
00:36:04,862 --> 00:36:07,490
His teeth were ground down to a powder

541
00:36:08,533 --> 00:36:12,333
and the front of his face exploded
out the back of his skull.

542
00:36:14,772 --> 00:36:16,603
He died instantly,

543
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:19,434
the next day.

544
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:21,402
That's horrible.

545
00:36:21,746 --> 00:36:23,111
I know.

546
00:36:23,214 --> 00:36:24,181
When my mom married Frank,

547
00:36:24,282 --> 00:36:27,843
I kept my dad's last name
to honor his memory.

548
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:32,679
And every time I do a stunt,
I know he's watching.

549
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:42,966
Okay, people, training's going great,
but Frank's running out of time.

550
00:36:43,067 --> 00:36:45,160
So I'm officially kicking off phase two,

551
00:36:45,336 --> 00:36:47,964
Operation Fiscal Jackhammer.

552
00:36:48,573 --> 00:36:52,009
Starting right now, we're gonna fill
this jug with 5 grand.

553
00:36:52,109 --> 00:36:53,474
Let's work!

554
00:37:29,814 --> 00:37:32,510
-All right. Who has the keys?
-Oh, man.

555
00:37:32,617 --> 00:37:34,084
Rod, we're gonna be right there!

556
00:37:34,185 --> 00:37:35,743
Oh, my God. Find them, find them!

557
00:37:39,657 --> 00:37:41,284
I found the key.

558
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,289
They grow up so fast.

559
00:37:44,395 --> 00:37:45,919
Get the fuck off my porch.

560
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:47,298
Sounds good.

561
00:37:47,298 --> 00:37:47,423
Sounds good.

562
00:38:49,193 --> 00:38:50,660
Oh, no, Kevin!

563
00:38:58,969 --> 00:39:02,803
For he's a jolly good fellow

564
00:39:02,907 --> 00:39:06,070
For he's a jolly good fellow

565
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:08,805
For he's a jolly good fellow

566
00:39:08,913 --> 00:39:10,608
-ls everything ready?
-Now?

567
00:39:10,715 --> 00:39:12,740
-No, not now!
-Blow it now!

568
00:39:27,131 --> 00:39:29,656
-You're a terrible stuntman.
-What?

569
00:39:30,634 --> 00:39:33,125
-You're a terrible stuntman!
-What?

570
00:39:33,471 --> 00:39:35,496
You're a terrible stuntman!

571
00:39:35,606 --> 00:39:39,201
I'm just kidding. I can hear you.
It was just really mean.

572
00:39:41,011 --> 00:39:44,913
Tai chi teaches that if you focus
your body and mind,

573
00:39:45,916 --> 00:39:50,216
you'll be able to perform
at the peak of your abilities.

574
00:39:50,688 --> 00:39:52,053
Yes, sensei.

575
00:39:52,156 --> 00:39:54,488
You don't have to call me sensei, Rod.

576
00:39:55,025 --> 00:39:56,219
Got it.

577
00:39:58,028 --> 00:40:00,292
Sensei, I have a question.

578
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:01,490
Is there a tai chi move

579
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:04,500
that would make a grown man
crap his pants, and not know why?

580
00:40:04,602 --> 00:40:08,197
I'm not gonna lie to you, Rod.
That move does exist.

581
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:11,137
But you're not ready for it yet.

582
00:40:12,109 --> 00:40:14,202
As you wish, sensei.

583
00:40:14,311 --> 00:40:18,407
Now we take the ball
and we push the ball away.

584
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:21,208
Yeah, we could.

585
00:40:22,153 --> 00:40:26,317
Or you could cut the kiddie stuff
and show me the crap-yourself move.

586
00:40:34,965 --> 00:40:36,762
That didn't work.

587
00:40:37,835 --> 00:40:40,804
Anyways, I'm gonna get going, so,

588
00:40:41,505 --> 00:40:45,236
take it easy.
I'm gonna go see what Frank's doing.

589
00:40:45,342 --> 00:40:46,866
You wanted to see it, Rod.

590
00:40:46,977 --> 00:40:51,004
Yeah, I did want you to show me,
and you didn't, 'cause it didn't work.

591
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:54,084
So now I'm gonna go, 'cause
there's nothing left for me to learn.

592
00:40:54,185 --> 00:40:57,382
Thank you, though, for trying.
That was very nice of you to try.

593
00:40:58,689 --> 00:41:03,319
Please believe
I do my laundry with no pants on

594
00:41:08,232 --> 00:41:10,029
Hey, half-brother.

595
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:11,431
What you working on?

596
00:41:11,535 --> 00:41:14,368
-Nothing. I'm just messing around.
-Oh, yeah?

597
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:15,734
Let's take a look.

598
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:18,365
-Okay, but it's not really finished, so...
-Got it.

599
00:41:21,879 --> 00:41:24,871
That's something else
that I'm working on. For Mom.

600
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:26,643
-Not for me.
-Right.

601
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:28,217
Mom likes that stuff, so...

602
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:29,809
Here's the right one.

603
00:41:36,727 --> 00:41:37,853
ominique Wilkins.

604
00:41:44,368 --> 00:41:47,269
I'm Rod Kimble,
stuntman extraordinaire.

605
00:41:51,775 --> 00:41:53,072
Life is short.

606
00:41:59,617 --> 00:42:02,051
-That's it.
-Holy moly, Kev-bot.

607
00:42:02,653 --> 00:42:04,553
-That was beautiful.
-You liked it?

608
00:42:04,655 --> 00:42:06,623
Are you kidding me? I loved it!

609
00:42:06,724 --> 00:42:08,658
You're the next
Douglas Bubbletrousers!

610
00:42:08,759 --> 00:42:10,283
Wow, Rod. Thanks.

611
00:42:10,394 --> 00:42:14,455
Kevin, I just had a great idea.

612
00:43:24,668 --> 00:43:26,101
Hey, Frank.

613
00:43:26,203 --> 00:43:27,761
It's me, Rod.

614
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:32,375
I just wanted to let you know,
we've already raised over $3,000.

615
00:43:32,476 --> 00:43:34,501
Soon, I'll jump 15 buses

616
00:43:35,045 --> 00:43:37,639
and then I'm gonna kick your ass.

617
00:43:40,718 --> 00:43:44,779
I'm gonna assume you're laughing
at some funny dream you're having.

618
00:43:44,888 --> 00:43:47,049
You're a pussy.

619
00:43:48,192 --> 00:43:50,251
What is that, sleep-talking?

620
00:43:50,361 --> 00:43:51,555
You suck.

621
00:43:51,662 --> 00:43:54,324
Frank, open your eyes.
You are not asleep!

622
00:43:54,431 --> 00:43:57,867
I am asleep, homo.

623
00:43:58,802 --> 00:44:02,169
Oh, it's so good to see him
smiling again.

624
00:44:03,807 --> 00:44:07,106
Yeah! And you know what
won't make him smile?

625
00:44:08,278 --> 00:44:10,212
When I murder him!

626
00:44:15,052 --> 00:44:18,180
And I am genuinely sorry
about the window!

627
00:44:18,956 --> 00:44:21,356
Enjoy the show. Hey, how are you?

628
00:44:22,059 --> 00:44:23,026
Enjoy the show.

629
00:44:27,865 --> 00:44:30,197
Yeah, I have various responsibilities
within the crew, you know.

630
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:34,532
I'm kind of a jack-of-all-trades, really.
I one time manned a flamethrower.

631
00:44:34,638 --> 00:44:35,662
Cool.

632
00:44:35,773 --> 00:44:38,333
Of course it's cool.
It's awesome as shit.

633
00:44:38,442 --> 00:44:41,673
Here you go, Mr. and Mrs. Powell.
Front row seats.

634
00:44:41,779 --> 00:44:43,212
I hope you all enjoy the show.

635
00:44:43,313 --> 00:44:45,611
I can assure you I won't.

636
00:44:45,716 --> 00:44:47,377
-Thank you, Rico.
-Okay.

637
00:44:47,484 --> 00:44:48,917
Goodbye, Rico.

638
00:44:49,319 --> 00:44:51,219
Hey, I just did the numbers.

639
00:44:51,321 --> 00:44:54,484
We sold 200 tickets at 5 bucks apiece,
which comes to $1,000.

640
00:44:54,591 --> 00:44:56,718
Now, you add that to the money
from the birthday parties,

641
00:44:56,827 --> 00:44:58,624
and it's over $4,900.

642
00:44:58,729 --> 00:45:01,163
Rod, we're really gonna do this jump.

643
00:45:01,265 --> 00:45:03,995
Of course we are, Kevin.
We're geniuses!

644
00:45:06,103 --> 00:45:07,593
Oh, heads up.

645
00:45:08,305 --> 00:45:09,294
Oh, man.

646
00:45:53,117 --> 00:45:54,778
This guy's a moron!

647
00:45:54,885 --> 00:45:55,909
Shut up!

648
00:46:00,524 --> 00:46:02,048
You suck!

649
00:46:07,264 --> 00:46:09,425
We're all laughing at Rod!

650
00:46:12,369 --> 00:46:13,996
The devil's lies

651
00:46:15,072 --> 00:46:19,441
Run, red man
Run for your life

652
00:46:22,412 --> 00:46:26,473
Oh, my God. Bear.
No, there's a bear. Bear!

653
00:46:27,217 --> 00:46:28,878
Kevin, turn it off!

654
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:32,020
-Rod...
-I said, turn it off!

655
00:46:33,257 --> 00:46:35,452
I try to drink at least two a day.

656
00:46:37,661 --> 00:46:39,925
Oh, yeah!

657
00:46:41,431 --> 00:46:42,489
My Native American healer...

658
00:46:47,604 --> 00:46:49,231
Hey, what happened to the crazy movie!

659
00:46:49,339 --> 00:46:51,432
T ake it easy! Whoa, whoa.

660
00:46:52,676 --> 00:46:54,144
What the hell was that all about?

661
00:46:54,144 --> 00:46:54,371
What the hell was that all about?

662
00:46:54,478 --> 00:46:56,810
Rod, I'm sorry.
I don't know what they're laughing at.

663
00:46:56,914 --> 00:46:58,541
Your video made me look like an idiot!

664
00:46:58,649 --> 00:47:01,846
-I didn't mean to.
-What was it, Kev? Jealousy?

665
00:47:01,952 --> 00:47:04,921
You couldn't take everyone loving
my stunts and thinking you're short?

666
00:47:05,022 --> 00:47:06,785
-I'm not short.
-Yes, you are!

667
00:47:06,890 --> 00:47:08,323
No, I'm not!

668
00:47:08,725 --> 00:47:10,215
Whoa, whoa, hey, hey, guys.

669
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:11,385
-Oh, you guys.
-Come on, they're serious,

670
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:12,928
Iet them work it out.
Let them work it out.

671
00:47:13,030 --> 00:47:13,997
Let them work it out.

672
00:47:15,699 --> 00:47:18,031
Okay, I'm out. Peace, I'm out.

673
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:21,334
What do you want?

674
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:45,125
Come sit down, honey.

675
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:53,461
I failed, Mom.

676
00:47:53,904 --> 00:47:57,396
I lost all the money
and people laughed at my stunts.

677
00:47:57,507 --> 00:48:00,101
Dad would've been ashamed of me.

678
00:48:01,044 --> 00:48:03,478
Rod, there's something
I have to tell you.

679
00:48:04,381 --> 00:48:07,009
Something that I should've told you
a long time ago.

680
00:48:07,117 --> 00:48:08,311
What?

681
00:48:08,418 --> 00:48:12,286
I haven't been completely honest
with you about your father.

682
00:48:12,990 --> 00:48:15,288
You see, he wasn't a stuntman.

683
00:48:15,926 --> 00:48:17,086
What?

684
00:48:17,194 --> 00:48:19,526
He was a cashier in a tire shop.

685
00:48:21,098 --> 00:48:23,191
But what about the picture?

686
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:25,029
It was just a picture.

687
00:48:25,135 --> 00:48:29,265
Evel Knievel came to town, and
he posed with everyone in the store.

688
00:48:30,841 --> 00:48:32,103
You lied.

689
00:48:32,209 --> 00:48:34,268
You had such an imagination as a boy,

690
00:48:34,378 --> 00:48:35,868
and when you saw that picture

691
00:48:35,979 --> 00:48:38,948
you started to make up
these wonderful stories.

692
00:48:39,049 --> 00:48:42,507
And I didn't have the heart to tell you
it wasn't true.

693
00:48:42,819 --> 00:48:45,049
You have to believe me.
I did it out of love.

694
00:48:46,390 --> 00:48:48,153
So, how did he die?

695
00:48:48,258 --> 00:48:50,089
He choked on some pie.

696
00:48:50,193 --> 00:48:52,821
What? Come on. Seriously?

697
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:55,455
He wanted to win that contest so badly.

698
00:48:56,066 --> 00:48:57,033
Well,

699
00:48:58,268 --> 00:49:01,795
I guess if he wasn't a stuntman,
then neither am l.

700
00:49:02,539 --> 00:49:03,733
Rod.

701
00:49:04,741 --> 00:49:05,969
Rod!

702
00:49:07,444 --> 00:49:09,378
You did the right thing, honey.

703
00:49:41,478 --> 00:49:42,877
There he is.

704
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:44,743
Rod! Hey, Rod!

705
00:49:44,848 --> 00:49:46,110
Hold it right there, Rod.

706
00:49:46,216 --> 00:49:49,049
What in the hell
do you think you're doing?

707
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:50,551
Grocery shopping.

708
00:49:50,654 --> 00:49:52,315
I don't understand, Rod.

709
00:49:52,422 --> 00:49:56,688
I'm not a stuntman, Dave. I never was.
Just a normal dude.

710
00:49:56,860 --> 00:49:59,658
Well, what the hell are we supposed to
do, huh? Where's that leave us?

711
00:49:59,763 --> 00:50:01,253
I dunno, Rico. You tell me.

712
00:50:01,365 --> 00:50:03,595
What ever happened to
"Live as a team, die as a team?"

713
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:06,726
It's a sham, okay?
There's no such thing as a team.

714
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:08,031
You live and die alone.

715
00:50:08,138 --> 00:50:11,869
Do you see what you're doing to him?
You're making him upset.

716
00:50:11,975 --> 00:50:13,738
How important is this to you? Huh?

717
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:15,675
I don't even cry, and look at me.

718
00:50:15,779 --> 00:50:17,804
You're about to make
tears come out of my face.

719
00:50:17,914 --> 00:50:19,677
I'm sorry, okay?
This isn't what I wanted.

720
00:50:19,783 --> 00:50:21,683
Who am I supposed to build ramps for?

721
00:50:21,785 --> 00:50:24,583
Who am I supposed to
build ramps for now?

722
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:28,521
I just wanna be friends, Rod.

723
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:32,323
I want us to...

724
00:50:32,929 --> 00:50:34,362
For serious.

725
00:50:40,570 --> 00:50:43,198
You wanna know
why I joined the crew, Rod?

726
00:50:43,306 --> 00:50:44,898
It's 'cause ever since we were kids,

727
00:50:45,008 --> 00:50:48,171
you've always done exactly
what you wanted to do.

728
00:50:48,612 --> 00:50:53,311
And everybody else just grew up,
and got boring, and sold out.

729
00:50:53,417 --> 00:50:56,011
But you stayed exactly the same.

730
00:50:56,119 --> 00:50:57,984
Who cares what anyone thinks?

731
00:50:58,088 --> 00:51:01,421
You don't get it, do you, Denise?
I used to be legit.

732
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:04,925
In fact, I was too legit.

733
00:51:05,028 --> 00:51:07,189
I was too legit to quit.

734
00:51:07,297 --> 00:51:09,788
But now I'm not legit.

735
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:11,834
I'm un-legit.

736
00:51:11,935 --> 00:51:14,369
And for that reason, I must quit.

737
00:51:14,471 --> 00:51:15,529
You don't mean that.

738
00:51:15,639 --> 00:51:17,004
Yeah. I do.

739
00:51:18,942 --> 00:51:20,307
Stay sweet.

740
00:51:50,107 --> 00:51:53,406
-Hello?
-Rod. Hey, buddy, it's Dave.

741
00:51:54,211 --> 00:51:56,270
-From the crew.
-Yeah?

742
00:51:56,379 --> 00:51:57,607
Hey, man, what's going on, man?

743
00:51:57,714 --> 00:52:00,706
I just, you know, wanted to call,
see how you're doing.

744
00:52:00,817 --> 00:52:03,285
Maybe you'd wanna hang out,
you know?

745
00:52:03,386 --> 00:52:05,183
Possibly take me to the hospital?

746
00:52:05,288 --> 00:52:07,916
-You know? If you're free.
-ls everything okay?

747
00:52:08,024 --> 00:52:10,925
Yeah, yeah, yeah, man.
Everything's great.

748
00:52:11,027 --> 00:52:14,326
No, no. But, you know, it's probably
just precautionary, you know.

749
00:52:14,431 --> 00:52:15,830
If you just wanna swing by, man,

750
00:52:15,932 --> 00:52:17,365
I'd totally appreciate it.

751
00:52:17,467 --> 00:52:20,402
Yeah, sure. Just give me a minute.

752
00:52:20,937 --> 00:52:23,929
Rod, thank you so much...

753
00:52:41,057 --> 00:52:43,048
Hey, Rod. Thanks for the ride...

754
00:52:44,694 --> 00:52:45,991
Hey, buddy, how's it going?

755
00:52:46,096 --> 00:52:48,428
Dave, what happened to your eye?

756
00:52:48,532 --> 00:52:49,658
-This?
-Yeah.

757
00:52:49,766 --> 00:52:51,529
-ls it really noticeable?
-Yeah.

758
00:52:51,635 --> 00:52:56,038
Oh, man, it's totally serendipitous.
Well, I got off work early.

759
00:52:56,139 --> 00:52:59,040
And you know my buddy, Derrick?
Well, he was like...

760
00:52:59,142 --> 00:53:02,407
"I've got this acid, but I can't do it. "

761
00:53:02,512 --> 00:53:03,536
And I was all like,

762
00:53:03,647 --> 00:53:05,740
"Well, I'll do it. "

763
00:53:06,750 --> 00:53:08,308
So I did it.

764
00:53:09,553 --> 00:53:12,989
And by the time I got on
my banana board, man, I was...

765
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:16,159
I was tripping balls pretty hard, man.

766
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:19,985
So, I decided to get on my
bench grinder

767
00:53:20,096 --> 00:53:23,190
and a piece of metal flew up
and hit me right in the eye.

768
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:24,528
It was pretty awesome.

769
00:53:24,634 --> 00:53:26,829
And that brings us to now.

770
00:53:26,937 --> 00:53:30,100
Yeah, well, just try and relax.

771
00:53:30,774 --> 00:53:33,299
Can do, man. Can do.

772
00:53:36,379 --> 00:53:38,438
I'm gonna be honest with you, Rod.

773
00:53:38,648 --> 00:53:42,641
You look like a giant eagle
with fire all around you

774
00:53:43,153 --> 00:53:46,088
and you've got a mountain for a face.

775
00:53:46,189 --> 00:53:48,089
I'm guessing that's the drugs, Dave.

776
00:53:48,191 --> 00:53:51,160
Yeah, but it's also just kind of weird
seeing you drive this minivan.

777
00:53:51,261 --> 00:53:54,355
Yeah, well, it's my mom's.

778
00:53:56,466 --> 00:53:58,127
Balls, man!

779
00:53:59,102 --> 00:54:00,967
Man, we just ran over a small bus.

780
00:54:01,071 --> 00:54:03,005
This really small bus,
we just ran over it.

781
00:54:03,106 --> 00:54:04,368
I didn't see anything.

782
00:54:04,474 --> 00:54:06,499
Hey, we're here.

783
00:54:06,610 --> 00:54:08,942
Seriously, man, this is, like,

784
00:54:09,045 --> 00:54:12,708
one of the top ten nicest things
anybody has ever done for me.

785
00:54:12,816 --> 00:54:14,613
Don't worry about it.

786
00:54:22,592 --> 00:54:23,559
Hey,

787
00:54:24,194 --> 00:54:27,322
I know things are feeling
pretty bad for you right now,

788
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:31,696
what with your biological dad not being
a real stuntman and whatnot, but,

789
00:54:32,736 --> 00:54:35,830
I dunno, the way I look at it,
you've still got this other dad at home,

790
00:54:35,939 --> 00:54:39,238
sick in bed,
and you sure do love him, man.

791
00:54:39,342 --> 00:54:41,708
And if he's sick, and you've got
the talent to make him better,

792
00:54:41,811 --> 00:54:44,109
well, that's pretty special.

793
00:54:44,214 --> 00:54:46,774
And to deny that would just be

794
00:54:47,584 --> 00:54:48,812
dumb.

795
00:54:49,919 --> 00:54:52,649
All right. Take it easy, mountain-face!

796
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:59,428
-Hospital?
-Trash can!

797
00:55:01,531 --> 00:55:03,328
Sweet. Thanks, buddy.

798
00:55:15,979 --> 00:55:19,312
Teacher, there are things

799
00:55:19,416 --> 00:55:22,214
That I don't wanna learn

800
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:26,114
'Cause there ain't no joy

801
00:55:26,923 --> 00:55:28,857
For an uptown...

802
00:55:35,932 --> 00:55:37,229
Hey.

803
00:55:38,001 --> 00:55:39,059
Hey.

804
00:55:39,602 --> 00:55:40,899
So, look,

805
00:55:42,272 --> 00:55:46,436
I was way out of line, and I'm sorry.

806
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:48,875
It's okay.

807
00:55:50,013 --> 00:55:51,275
Sorry about your dad.

808
00:55:52,349 --> 00:55:53,543
Thanks.

809
00:55:54,984 --> 00:55:57,817
So, cool beans?

810
00:55:58,788 --> 00:56:00,153
Cool beans.

811
00:56:01,691 --> 00:56:02,817
Cool beans.

812
00:56:03,693 --> 00:56:04,990
Cool beans.

813
00:56:05,562 --> 00:56:06,654
Cool beans.

814
00:56:06,763 --> 00:56:08,162
-Cool beans.
-Cool beans.

815
00:56:08,264 --> 00:56:10,027
-Cool beans.
-Cool beans.

816
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:11,858
-Cool, cool.
-Bean, beans.

817
00:56:11,968 --> 00:56:12,935
-Cool.
-Beans.

818
00:56:13,036 --> 00:56:14,663
-Cool, cool.
-Beans, beans.

819
00:56:14,771 --> 00:56:15,738
-Cool...
-Beans.

820
00:56:15,839 --> 00:56:17,431
-Cool, cool
-Beans, beans

821
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:18,507
-Cool
-Beans

822
00:56:18,608 --> 00:56:21,270
-Cool
-Beans

823
00:56:21,378 --> 00:56:22,936
-Cool, cool
-Beans, beans

824
00:56:23,046 --> 00:56:24,070
-Cool
-Beans

825
00:56:24,180 --> 00:56:25,772
-Cool, cool
-Beans, beans

826
00:56:25,882 --> 00:56:26,871
-Cool
-Beans

827
00:56:26,983 --> 00:56:28,678
-Cool, cool
-Beans, beans

828
00:56:28,785 --> 00:56:29,752
-Cool
-Beans

829
00:56:29,853 --> 00:56:31,684
-Cool, cool, cool
-Beans

830
00:56:31,788 --> 00:56:33,016
Cool beans!

831
00:56:36,192 --> 00:56:38,387
So, cool beans?

832
00:56:38,828 --> 00:56:41,092
Yeah. Cool beans.

833
00:56:41,197 --> 00:56:43,961
Good.
Because I have some exciting news.

834
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:45,289
So, before the screening,

835
00:56:45,435 --> 00:56:47,733
I took the liberty of posting
some of the stunt footage online.

836
00:56:47,837 --> 00:56:48,963
Great.

837
00:56:49,072 --> 00:56:50,437
Well, I guess people
liked what they saw,

838
00:56:50,540 --> 00:56:52,235
because it started to get sent around.

839
00:56:52,342 --> 00:56:53,832
As of this morning,
it's been downloaded

840
00:56:53,943 --> 00:56:56,309
over 1 00,000 times.

841
00:56:56,413 --> 00:56:57,539
Seriously?

842
00:56:57,647 --> 00:57:02,311
Yeah. It's bouncing around the web like
a beach ball at a Nickelback concert.

843
00:57:02,619 --> 00:57:04,610
But that's not even the best part.

844
00:57:04,721 --> 00:57:06,552
KNER called us.

845
00:57:06,656 --> 00:57:09,284
-The AM radio station?
-Yeah.

846
00:57:09,392 --> 00:57:11,952
They heard about the web stuff,
and how we're trying to save Frank

847
00:57:12,061 --> 00:57:13,494
and they wanna sponsor the bus jump,

848
00:57:13,596 --> 00:57:16,030
with all the proceeds going
to Frank's surgery.

849
00:57:16,132 --> 00:57:18,123
And what'd you tell them?

850
00:57:19,903 --> 00:57:22,201
I think you'll be needing this.

851
00:57:47,497 --> 00:57:49,158
Oh, hey, Mr. Pasternack.

852
00:57:49,732 --> 00:57:51,199
Hey, Kevin.

853
00:57:51,301 --> 00:57:55,101
Hi. Mr. Pasternack, I'd like
to introduce you to my brother, Rod.

854
00:57:55,205 --> 00:57:57,139
-Pleasure to meet you, son.
-Hi.

855
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:59,834
Mr. Pasternack is the owner of
the radio station that's funding the jump.

856
00:57:59,943 --> 00:58:01,808
And I'm the number one DJ.

857
00:58:01,911 --> 00:58:03,344
No shit.

858
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:07,238
I've gotta tell you, boys, I couldn't be
more excited about this jump.

859
00:58:07,350 --> 00:58:11,719
When people hear me describing it over
the radio, they are going to remember

860
00:58:11,821 --> 00:58:16,451
that AM radio is a viable and modern
source for news and entertainment.

861
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:18,186
Totally.

862
00:58:18,294 --> 00:58:20,421
I used to be number one in this town,

863
00:58:20,530 --> 00:58:22,828
but people don't listen to AM
like they used to.

864
00:58:22,932 --> 00:58:25,765
Seems like it's more
about FM and color TV.

865
00:58:25,869 --> 00:58:28,030
-That's stupid.
-lt sure is, Kevin.

866
00:58:28,137 --> 00:58:32,073
In fact, I've got a tattoo here
that fully illustrates my point.

867
00:58:32,175 --> 00:58:36,612
It's of this rebellious young man,
and he's urinating on an FM radio.

868
00:58:36,713 --> 00:58:40,342
And then this other stream of urine is
going onto that television set.

869
00:58:40,450 --> 00:58:41,940
Implausible, I know,

870
00:58:42,085 --> 00:58:44,383
but I like to imagine
that he had sex the night before,

871
00:58:44,487 --> 00:58:47,718
and now a little bit of residue
is blocking his urethra,

872
00:58:47,824 --> 00:58:50,486
allowing the urine to flow
in two separate directions.

873
00:58:50,593 --> 00:58:54,529
You may also note that an AM radio
is sitting, safely dry, in the middle.

874
00:58:54,631 --> 00:58:56,428
It's on a little magic carpet there.

875
00:58:56,533 --> 00:58:58,626
Oh, yeah, look at that.

876
00:58:58,735 --> 00:59:03,468
Now, Rod, I've spent
the station's last $15,000 on this.

877
00:59:03,573 --> 00:59:06,906
So it has to be a big success.
You understand?

878
00:59:07,010 --> 00:59:09,740
-You can count on me, sir.
-Excellent.

879
00:59:09,846 --> 00:59:13,942
This is the big one, boys.
This is the one that brings us back.

880
00:59:14,250 --> 00:59:18,380
Soon, AM radio will reign king
once more!

881
00:59:35,872 --> 00:59:38,033
Honey, your phone's ringing.

882
00:59:38,241 --> 00:59:39,731
What?

883
00:59:40,109 --> 00:59:41,974
Don't worry, I got it.

884
00:59:45,381 --> 00:59:46,348
Hello.

885
00:59:46,449 --> 00:59:48,610
Hi, may I speak to Denise, please?

886
00:59:48,718 --> 00:59:51,585
No, she's in the can.
Can I take a message?

887
00:59:51,688 --> 00:59:53,656
-Jonathan?
-Yup.

888
00:59:53,756 --> 00:59:55,587
Okay. You got a pen?

889
00:59:55,692 --> 00:59:57,557
Yes, sir. Got one right here.

890
00:59:57,660 --> 00:59:59,093
The message is,

891
00:59:59,195 --> 01:00:00,924
"Denise, it's Rod.

892
01:00:01,030 --> 01:00:05,899
"I'm jumping 15 buses tomorrow at
the fairgrounds. Hope you can make it. "

893
01:00:06,002 --> 01:00:08,903
Fifteen buses.

894
01:00:09,005 --> 01:00:10,768
Wait, did you really write it down,

895
01:00:10,873 --> 01:00:13,068
or are you just waving your arm
around in the air?

896
01:00:13,176 --> 01:00:16,634
Come on.
Rod, you've got some imagination, kid.

897
01:00:16,746 --> 01:00:18,680
Don't worry about it.
I'm gonna get her the message.

898
01:00:18,781 --> 01:00:20,043
Okay.

899
01:00:21,484 --> 01:00:23,076
Who was that?

900
01:00:23,186 --> 01:00:24,676
Wrong number.

901
01:00:35,898 --> 01:00:37,422
I give the old man a week.

902
01:00:37,533 --> 01:00:39,501
Really insensitive, Bob.

903
01:00:45,475 --> 01:00:47,306
He's had a bad day.

904
01:00:47,944 --> 01:00:50,208
Maybe you should sit with him.

905
01:01:04,594 --> 01:01:05,959
Hey, Frank.

906
01:01:06,396 --> 01:01:09,695
I know you're not feeling so good,
but I need you to hold on a little longer.

907
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:12,868
The big jump's tomorrow.

908
01:01:13,603 --> 01:01:15,127
We're gonna sell tickets

909
01:01:15,238 --> 01:01:17,798
and people are gonna hear about it
at home on the AM radio

910
01:01:17,907 --> 01:01:19,602
and donate money.

911
01:01:19,976 --> 01:01:21,671
It's basically the perfect plan.

912
01:01:24,814 --> 01:01:27,180
You're gonna get yourself killed.

913
01:01:27,950 --> 01:01:31,442
Well, I'd rather die than live in a world
where I can't kick your ass.

914
01:01:35,925 --> 01:01:36,983
Rod.

915
01:01:39,996 --> 01:01:41,054
What?

916
01:01:41,164 --> 01:01:43,530
You know why I've been so hard on you?

917
01:01:43,633 --> 01:01:48,093
Because when I'm gone, you're gonna
have to be the man around here.

918
01:01:48,638 --> 01:01:54,235
Frank, if I do land this jump,
will you respect me?

919
01:02:02,385 --> 01:02:05,877
Not until you beat me in a fight,
you pathetic washout.

920
01:02:06,289 --> 01:02:08,553
I can't wait to punch your face in.

921
01:02:08,758 --> 01:02:11,090
And I can't wait for you to try.

922
01:05:02,398 --> 01:05:05,231
What the hell? Was that because of us?

923
01:05:05,334 --> 01:05:09,065
I dunno, man. It started off
super positive, then it just got crazy.

924
01:05:09,171 --> 01:05:10,638
I did not like that at all.

925
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:12,833
No, Kev. None of us did.

926
01:05:12,942 --> 01:05:15,376
Yeah, it was totally messed up.

927
01:05:15,912 --> 01:05:18,847
It's disgusting how people will just,
you know, take something good

928
01:05:18,948 --> 01:05:21,348
-and just take advantage of a situation.
-Yeah.

929
01:05:21,450 --> 01:05:23,782
There was no time to do anything,
except just leave

930
01:05:23,886 --> 01:05:26,411
and just hope that you're not hurt.

931
01:05:26,522 --> 01:05:27,784
It's great to have you guys back,
by the way.

932
01:05:27,890 --> 01:05:29,016
-Well, thank you, man.
-Feels good to be back.

933
01:05:29,125 --> 01:05:31,389
-So, you wanna...
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

934
01:05:31,494 --> 01:05:35,692
The dog walked itself home,
ate a pizza, and took a nap.

935
01:05:36,032 --> 01:05:39,092
In local news,
self-proclaimed stuntman Rod Kimble

936
01:05:39,201 --> 01:05:42,602
is going to attempt to jump
fifteen buses today.

937
01:05:42,705 --> 01:05:44,730
We would bring you
coverage of the jump,

938
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:49,937
but apparently an AM radio station
has the exclusive broadcasting rights.

939
01:05:50,046 --> 01:05:52,378
In other news, riots broke out...

940
01:05:52,481 --> 01:05:53,539
T errific.

941
01:05:54,216 --> 01:05:56,013
Buckle your seatbelts
and open your ears,

942
01:05:56,118 --> 01:05:59,451
it's a jump for the ages today
on KNER AM.

943
01:05:59,555 --> 01:06:03,548
But first, here's Duke Wentworth
with A Jim-Jam Jubilee.

944
01:06:04,694 --> 01:06:07,219
-All right, there you go.
-Here, Rod.

945
01:06:07,330 --> 01:06:08,763
-Cool, what's your name?
-Matt.

946
01:06:08,864 --> 01:06:13,392
Matt. You are cool. Don't be like Frank.

947
01:06:13,903 --> 01:06:15,894
Rod. There you go.

948
01:06:16,005 --> 01:06:17,233
Thanks, Rod.

949
01:06:17,340 --> 01:06:20,104
All right, thanks, guys.
And don't let your dads eat pie.

950
01:06:20,209 --> 01:06:21,904
Hey, Kev.

951
01:06:22,411 --> 01:06:25,005
-Have you seen Denise anywhere?
-No, I haven't seen her all day.

952
01:06:30,386 --> 01:06:33,116
-What was that?
-We just hit a raccoon.

953
01:06:33,689 --> 01:06:35,520
Jonathan, don't you think
we should stop?

954
01:06:35,625 --> 01:06:38,287
Oh, trust me, babe. That raccoon
would not have stopped for us.

955
01:06:38,394 --> 01:06:39,554
Are you serious?

956
01:06:39,662 --> 01:06:42,995
Oh, my God. I can't wait to tell Sullivan.
He'll be so psyched.

957
01:06:46,435 --> 01:06:49,893
I'm gonna grab a Vitaminwater.
Should I make that dos?

958
01:06:50,206 --> 01:06:51,571
No, thanks.

959
01:06:51,674 --> 01:06:53,005
Coolio.

960
01:06:53,676 --> 01:06:55,439
Hey, maybe I'll get a box of dong bags

961
01:06:55,544 --> 01:06:57,409
so we can knock boots later,
what do you think?

962
01:07:00,449 --> 01:07:03,043
Truly a momentous day for listening

963
01:07:03,252 --> 01:07:06,881
as stuntman Rod Kimble
will jump 1 5 buses

964
01:07:06,989 --> 01:07:09,082
in a last-ditch effort
to save his stepfather.

965
01:07:09,191 --> 01:07:10,522
My oops, forgot my wallet.

966
01:07:10,626 --> 01:07:12,526
Jonathan, Rod's doing the jump.

967
01:07:12,628 --> 01:07:14,687
Oh, my God, who cares?

968
01:07:14,797 --> 01:07:16,822
Babe, why do you hang
with those nerds?

969
01:07:17,466 --> 01:07:18,899
I like those nerds.

970
01:07:19,001 --> 01:07:21,196
Well, guess what?
You're embarrassing yourself.

971
01:07:21,837 --> 01:07:25,295
It's only embarrassing if you care
what people think.

972
01:07:25,408 --> 01:07:27,069
That's a good one. I like that.

973
01:07:27,943 --> 01:07:30,343
-Babe?
-Goodbye.

974
01:07:30,613 --> 01:07:32,513
Babe, wait. Babe, wait.

975
01:07:32,615 --> 01:07:35,709
Babe, wait! Babe!

976
01:07:35,818 --> 01:07:38,480
Babe, wait! Babe. Babe. Babe.

977
01:07:38,587 --> 01:07:41,385
Babe! Babe, wait. Babe, no!

978
01:07:41,490 --> 01:07:43,390
Babe, no! Babe, no!

979
01:07:43,559 --> 01:07:47,928
Babe!

980
01:07:48,030 --> 01:07:51,727
Babe, babe, babe! No, babe!

981
01:07:52,068 --> 01:07:53,092
Wait!

982
01:08:03,145 --> 01:08:04,305
No way.

983
01:08:04,413 --> 01:08:05,880
You're gonna look
like a champion, Rod.

984
01:08:05,981 --> 01:08:08,279
You guys, this thing is number one.

985
01:08:08,384 --> 01:08:10,375
-Wait, Rod, there's more.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

986
01:08:10,486 --> 01:08:13,114
We were worried that the moped
might not be fast enough

987
01:08:13,222 --> 01:08:15,349
to clear the jump, so...

988
01:08:18,527 --> 01:08:19,858
No way.

989
01:08:22,765 --> 01:08:23,732
Whoa.

990
01:08:24,133 --> 01:08:26,260
Dave, this thing is number one!

991
01:08:26,368 --> 01:08:29,394
Now, I know she doesn't look like much,
but trust me, man.

992
01:08:29,505 --> 01:08:32,133
-She's got some kick. A lot.
-All right.

993
01:08:32,241 --> 01:08:33,435
There's one more thing, Rod.

994
01:08:33,542 --> 01:08:36,511
I know how you like explosions
and showmanship and stuff.

995
01:08:36,612 --> 01:08:38,773
So, I rigged the whole jump
with fireworks.

996
01:08:38,881 --> 01:08:40,041
Cool.

997
01:08:40,149 --> 01:08:42,982
And I got you this rock to represent
all my hard work.

998
01:08:43,085 --> 01:08:45,110
Oh, cool, Rico.

999
01:08:46,355 --> 01:08:47,686
That's number one.

1000
01:08:47,790 --> 01:08:51,248
Yeah, you can pretty much just toss
that after the fireworks go off. It's cool.

1001
01:08:51,360 --> 01:08:52,588
Thanks.

1002
01:08:53,496 --> 01:08:54,520
Thanks, all of you.

1003
01:09:33,602 --> 01:09:37,231
Okay, everyone. It's the moment
we've all been waiting for.

1004
01:09:37,339 --> 01:09:41,105
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you Rod Kimble!

1005
01:10:06,235 --> 01:10:07,497
He's going in circles!

1006
01:10:11,540 --> 01:10:12,529
Rod!

1007
01:10:13,709 --> 01:10:15,040
Rod!

1008
01:10:20,282 --> 01:10:21,249
Rod!

1009
01:10:30,626 --> 01:10:34,357
Who wants to see me do
a big-ass stunt?

1010
01:10:41,370 --> 01:10:43,565
Ladies and gentlemen.

1011
01:10:43,906 --> 01:10:45,840
What is destiny?

1012
01:10:46,442 --> 01:10:47,932
What is fate?

1013
01:10:48,444 --> 01:10:52,581
I dedicate this jump to fathers
and father figures everywhere.

1014
01:10:52,581 --> 01:10:52,603
I dedicate this jump to fathers
and father figures everywhere.

1015
01:10:53,148 --> 01:10:59,712
I hope that in some small way
all of their sons manage to jump them.

1016
01:10:59,822 --> 01:11:03,258
Frank, I'm gonna get you better,
you old sack of shit.

1017
01:11:03,359 --> 01:11:08,922
And then I am gonna uncork the
ass-beating of a lifetime on you!

1018
01:11:09,031 --> 01:11:11,556
And you will respect me!

1019
01:11:11,667 --> 01:11:12,827
Peace!

1020
01:11:25,147 --> 01:11:28,207
Kimble clearly has a few issues
with his stepfather there.

1021
01:11:28,317 --> 01:11:30,547
But who doesn't? I know I do.

1022
01:11:35,391 --> 01:11:36,653
You got this, man!

1023
01:11:36,759 --> 01:11:40,251
Just remember.
Drive really, really, really fast, okay?

1024
01:11:40,362 --> 01:11:42,523
And hold on tight! You'll be fine!

1025
01:11:42,631 --> 01:11:44,895
I'm so nervous for you!

1026
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,992
And everybody here is!
We're nervous for you!

1027
01:11:48,103 --> 01:11:49,229
I was just in the bathroom,

1028
01:11:49,338 --> 01:11:52,899
and everybody's talking about
how crazy this is.

1029
01:11:53,008 --> 01:11:54,202
-Okay.
-Don't worry about it.

1030
01:11:54,310 --> 01:11:56,904
You're gonna do great!
Now go kick those buses' ass!

1031
01:11:59,381 --> 01:12:01,872
You good?

1032
01:12:03,419 --> 01:12:06,855
Do you like stunts?
What about terminally ill stepfathers?

1033
01:12:07,289 --> 01:12:09,450
Well, if you answered yes to one
or both of those questions,

1034
01:12:09,558 --> 01:12:13,551
you couldn't have picked a better day
to stumble upon KNER radio.

1035
01:12:36,218 --> 01:12:37,651
Hey, Rod!

1036
01:12:37,753 --> 01:12:39,345
Denise. You came.

1037
01:12:39,455 --> 01:12:41,855
Of course.

1038
01:12:41,957 --> 01:12:43,083
Oh, wow.

1039
01:12:43,192 --> 01:12:44,489
Yeah.

1040
01:12:46,028 --> 01:12:48,929
-Denise, I don't know what I'm doing.
-What?

1041
01:12:49,031 --> 01:12:52,125
I mean, this jump is huge. I could die.

1042
01:12:53,435 --> 01:12:55,460
You're the bravest guy I know, Rod.

1043
01:12:57,439 --> 01:12:58,929
I don't know what to believe anymore.

1044
01:12:59,808 --> 01:13:01,867
Believe in this.

1045
01:13:11,053 --> 01:13:12,315
Oh, wait.

1046
01:13:12,421 --> 01:13:14,048
What? You don't...

1047
01:13:14,156 --> 01:13:17,455
No, I do. I do. I just...

1048
01:13:17,559 --> 01:13:20,858
-Your mouth was all open.
-Oh, God.

1049
01:13:20,963 --> 01:13:23,295
It was just like...

1050
01:13:23,599 --> 01:13:24,725
Anyways.

1051
01:13:29,538 --> 01:13:33,269
Oh, whoa, wait, what?
Why is Rod kissing his sister, man?

1052
01:13:33,375 --> 01:13:35,775
Denise isn't his sister.

1053
01:13:35,878 --> 01:13:38,346
-She's not?
-No.

1054
01:13:38,447 --> 01:13:40,608
Man, that shatters my entire universe.

1055
01:13:40,716 --> 01:13:42,946
I'm not saying
that kiss was hot, listeners,

1056
01:13:43,052 --> 01:13:47,182
but if the boner police are here,
I demand a lawyer!

1057
01:13:47,289 --> 01:13:50,122
-Good luck, Rod.
-Thanks.

1058
01:13:54,096 --> 01:13:57,327
All right, swing man. Back in business.

1059
01:13:57,433 --> 01:13:59,560
Hey, how are you?

1060
01:14:03,639 --> 01:14:06,904
Kimble's preparing
for his final approach.

1061
01:14:07,009 --> 01:14:11,537
Ascending the multiple ramp levels
to the tippy-top.

1062
01:14:42,044 --> 01:14:44,535
Why'd the numbers stop?

1063
01:14:44,646 --> 01:14:47,080
I guess people wanna see
what happens.

1064
01:14:50,085 --> 01:14:53,020
Souls of the animal kingdom.

1065
01:14:53,122 --> 01:14:59,618
Eagle, fox, bottlenose dolphin,
octopus, house cat.

1066
01:15:01,263 --> 01:15:03,527
Okay.

1067
01:15:03,632 --> 01:15:05,293
Let's jump this jump.

1068
01:15:11,940 --> 01:15:13,737
Come on, Rod!

1069
01:15:18,347 --> 01:15:19,541
Here he goes.

1070
01:15:21,016 --> 01:15:24,679
He's driving the bikey-thing
with his hands and legs.

1071
01:15:24,786 --> 01:15:27,016
This needs to be seen to be believed!

1072
01:15:28,023 --> 01:15:31,481
Three, two, one, liftoff!

1073
01:16:04,359 --> 01:16:06,793
Oh, he's like a broken doll.

1074
01:16:13,769 --> 01:16:15,236
Oh, this does not look good.

1075
01:16:15,337 --> 01:16:17,362
Rod's crew is running to his side.

1076
01:16:17,472 --> 01:16:19,997
I, for one, hope none of them had a fight
with Rod this morning,

1077
01:16:20,108 --> 01:16:22,303
because he is more than likely dead.

1078
01:16:22,444 --> 01:16:24,071
-Rod.
-Oh, no.

1079
01:16:25,447 --> 01:16:27,881
-Rod, are you okay? Can you hear me?
-Step aside, please.

1080
01:16:27,983 --> 01:16:30,474
Rod, stay away from the light, man.
Don't go towards that light.

1081
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:33,945
Rod?

1082
01:16:38,660 --> 01:16:39,649
Oh, God, he's probably having

1083
01:16:39,761 --> 01:16:42,594
some sort of profound,
out-of-body experience.

1084
01:16:56,478 --> 01:16:57,604
Hi.

1085
01:17:04,286 --> 01:17:06,516
Oh, yes. Yes.

1086
01:17:10,325 --> 01:17:11,383
Yes.

1087
01:17:12,561 --> 01:17:14,620
-I'm not getting any vitals.
-Oh, Rod.

1088
01:17:17,532 --> 01:17:18,590
Rod?

1089
01:17:18,700 --> 01:17:20,292
Finish him! Finish him!

1090
01:17:20,402 --> 01:17:22,063
Yes, taco!

1091
01:17:23,739 --> 01:17:25,832
Rod? Rod?

1092
01:17:25,941 --> 01:17:27,238
Denise?

1093
01:17:27,342 --> 01:17:28,809
Hoobastank.

1094
01:17:28,910 --> 01:17:30,707
He's alive.

1095
01:17:32,214 --> 01:17:35,012
Denise. You were right.

1096
01:17:35,117 --> 01:17:36,106
The taco won.

1097
01:17:37,386 --> 01:17:39,911
Okay, Rod. Okay.

1098
01:17:40,022 --> 01:17:41,046
Time to get up.

1099
01:17:41,156 --> 01:17:43,989
-No, no, Rod, don't move. Don't move.
-You could have internal injuries.

1100
01:17:44,092 --> 01:17:46,959
Sorry, guys. I'm walking out of here.

1101
01:17:47,062 --> 01:17:50,554
No, no, no. No, no, no, Rod.

1102
01:17:50,666 --> 01:17:51,690
Wait a minute.

1103
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:55,964
It appears Kimble is awake,
and he's trying to stand up.

1104
01:17:56,071 --> 01:17:58,471
Seriously, you're probably
hurt pretty bad.

1105
01:17:58,573 --> 01:18:00,200
I'd say definitely, Kevin.

1106
01:18:00,309 --> 01:18:03,403
I'd wager 10 to 20 broken bones,
minimum.

1107
01:18:05,013 --> 01:18:06,503
But life is pain

1108
01:18:06,615 --> 01:18:10,415
and we've got to scrape the joy out of it
every chance we get.

1109
01:18:10,519 --> 01:18:12,953
-Excuse me.
-Okay.

1110
01:18:13,855 --> 01:18:15,220
Rod.

1111
01:18:15,490 --> 01:18:18,516
Rod! Rod! Rod!

1112
01:18:18,627 --> 01:18:22,461
The crowd is cheering Kimble
back to life.

1113
01:18:23,298 --> 01:18:26,324
Rod! Rod! Rod!

1114
01:18:28,970 --> 01:18:33,373
Rod! Rod! Rod!

1115
01:18:42,584 --> 01:18:45,075
And the phones are ringing off the hook!

1116
01:18:55,530 --> 01:18:59,466
Rod. Rod, look. Look.

1117
01:19:12,147 --> 01:19:13,978
We did it!

1118
01:19:18,019 --> 01:19:19,111
They've done it!

1119
01:19:19,221 --> 01:19:24,523
They've raised $50,000
for Frank's conveniently-priced surgery.

1120
01:19:30,632 --> 01:19:32,532
Rod, Rod! Over here!

1121
01:19:32,634 --> 01:19:34,226
We did it, Richardson!

1122
01:19:34,936 --> 01:19:36,904
Rod knows my name.
Rod knows my name.

1123
01:19:37,005 --> 01:19:38,063
Rod knows my name!

1124
01:19:38,173 --> 01:19:41,006
People are screaming
and jumping up and down.

1125
01:19:41,109 --> 01:19:43,304
The fairgrounds are literally shaking!

1126
01:19:44,913 --> 01:19:47,848
A cooked goose for everyone!

1127
01:19:47,949 --> 01:19:49,883
It's Ebenezer Scrooge!

1128
01:19:49,985 --> 01:19:52,783
Yes, a cooked goose.

1129
01:19:54,055 --> 01:19:55,920
Dave.

1130
01:20:29,891 --> 01:20:33,349
-Rod, do you really need to do this?
-Yes.

1131
01:20:33,462 --> 01:20:35,953
Come on, Rod. The doctor said
his heart's even stronger than before.

1132
01:20:36,064 --> 01:20:37,326
You're not gonna win.

1133
01:20:37,432 --> 01:20:39,593
Kevin, it's not up for discussion.

1134
01:20:41,903 --> 01:20:45,361
Gods of war!

1135
01:20:45,474 --> 01:20:47,942
May your hammer be mighty

1136
01:20:50,946 --> 01:20:52,208
Here I am, Frank.

1137
01:20:53,882 --> 01:20:57,443
Get ready to meet your maker. Oh, God!

1138
01:20:57,552 --> 01:20:59,281
We hadn't even started yet!

1139
01:20:59,387 --> 01:21:01,480
Never underestimate your opponent.

1140
01:21:07,462 --> 01:21:11,262
What's up now, Frank?
I'm doing this because I love you!

1141
01:21:17,472 --> 01:21:20,908
-Never underestimate your opponent.
-Well, well, well.

1142
01:21:21,009 --> 01:21:26,174
Finally, a fight I might actually...

1143
01:21:27,349 --> 01:21:29,909
-Got you.
-What the hell? Is that a throwing star?

1144
01:21:55,877 --> 01:21:58,311
Oh, hell, yeah, Roddy! Kick his ass!

1145
01:21:58,413 --> 01:22:00,711
Come on, old man! Come on!

1146
01:22:00,815 --> 01:22:03,648
Old man, young heart!

1147
01:22:05,554 --> 01:22:06,748
Good Lord!

1148
01:22:08,490 --> 01:22:11,823
Oh, shit. No mercy.

1149
01:22:12,694 --> 01:22:14,457
Guys, come on, come on. That's rented.

1150
01:22:17,032 --> 01:22:18,465
Jesus Christ.

1151
01:22:20,035 --> 01:22:21,798
He just rocked him with a brick!

1152
01:22:22,671 --> 01:22:23,797
Oh!

1153
01:22:25,307 --> 01:22:26,433
Here we go.

1154
01:22:28,276 --> 01:22:30,574
-Should we stop them?
-Oh, no, they're fine.

1155
01:22:36,818 --> 01:22:39,378
-Oh, no.
-Say it, Frank!

1156
01:22:39,487 --> 01:22:41,819
-Say I'm a man.
-Never.

1157
01:22:45,427 --> 01:22:48,260
-Say it!
-You're a man.

1158
01:22:48,363 --> 01:22:49,660
Say it again!

1159
01:22:50,899 --> 01:22:53,527
You're a man, son.

1160
01:22:58,139 --> 01:23:00,308
You've gotta be kidding me.

1161
01:23:00,308 --> 01:23:00,399
You've gotta be kidding me.

1162
01:23:00,508 --> 01:23:01,941
Yeah!
