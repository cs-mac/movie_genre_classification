00:48:19,146 --> 00:48:24,106
I was 100% sincere. It's not easy
being the Barbra Streisand of Evil.

599
00:48:24,184 --> 00:48:28,621
- [ Chuckling ]
- Now, what have we learned so far ?

600
00:48:28,689 --> 00:48:30,816
Well, let's see.

601
00:48:30,891 --> 00:48:33,883
- I'm starting to think women
don't know what they want.
- Amen !

602
00:48:33,961 --> 00:48:37,590
They say they want sensitivity, but
did you see how fast Alison went for...

603
00:48:37,665 --> 00:48:40,998
- those tough-guy dudes on the beach ?
- Which tells you ?

604
00:48:41,068 --> 00:48:44,970
That-- Well, it tells me
that I wanna be really big and strong.

605
00:48:45,039 --> 00:48:49,203
You know, I wanna have a great body
and be tall and-- Like-- [ Grunts ]

606
00:48:49,276 --> 00:48:51,210
- Go on.
- And I wanna be athletic.

607
00:48:51,278 --> 00:48:53,508
- Check.
- And I wanna be rich too.

608
00:48:53,581 --> 00:48:57,381
But I want it to be
for something that I like doing,
and people really like me for.

609
00:48:57,451 --> 00:48:59,544
Great ! This is getting
really specific.

610
00:48:59,620 --> 00:49:02,680
Let's see--
big, strong, rich, athletic,

611
00:49:02,756 --> 00:49:05,884
something you like,
lots of fans--

612
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:09,088
- Are you thinking what I'm thinking ?
- Oh, I hope so.

613
00:49:09,163 --> 00:49:12,530
- In the form of a wish ?
- I wish I could play
professional basketball.

614
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:15,899
Then I'll just say
the magic words: Dennis Rodman.

615
00:49:15,970 --> 00:49:18,438
- [Buzzer Sounding]
- [ Screaming ] No !

616
00:49:18,505 --> 00:49:21,941
Just kidding.
Michael Jordan.

617
00:49:22,009 --> 00:49:24,375
Yeah !

618
00:49:25,913 --> 00:49:29,940
[ Crowd ]
Three, two, one !

619
00:49:32,319 --> 00:49:34,150
[Announcer]
And that's it. That's the game.

620
00:49:34,221 --> 00:49:38,180
The fans are going nuts
here at the Forum in Los Angeles.

621
00:49:38,258 --> 00:49:43,127
The score: 135 to 85.
Elliot Richards has totally dominated.

622
00:49:43,197 --> 00:49:45,927
If you're just tuning in,
it's a shame because you just missed...

623
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,968
one of the greatest performances
in the history of sports.

624
00:49:48,035 --> 00:49:49,969
Absolutely, Jerry.
Absolutely.

625
00:49:50,037 --> 00:49:54,167
People said basketball caught fire with
the "ascendry" of Michael Jordan.

626
00:49:54,241 --> 00:49:56,971
But I tell you, after what
we seen here tonight,

627
00:49:57,044 --> 00:49:59,410
a lot of people are gonna
be saying, "Michael who ?"

628
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:02,745
[Jerry] Right from the get-go, the
fans took a look at Elliot Richards...

629
00:50:02,816 --> 00:50:05,216
and a couple women fainted.

630
00:50:05,285 --> 00:50:08,880
And a couple fellas-- I'd rather not
say-- but they liked what they saw.

631
00:50:08,956 --> 00:50:11,823
[Dan] Absolutely.
He's a big fella and an imposing fella.

632
00:50:11,892 --> 00:50:15,157
He's enormous. He's listed at 7'6"
in the program,

633
00:50:15,229 --> 00:50:18,221
but I'd say he plays the game
like he's 11 feet tall.

634
00:50:18,298 --> 00:50:20,232
No, I don't think
he that big, Jerry.

635
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:23,292
No, I'm saying the game
he plays is-is-is--

636
00:50:23,370 --> 00:50:25,429
is that of
some Viking giant...

637
00:50:25,506 --> 00:50:28,634
with a basketball in one hand
and a club in the other...

638
00:50:28,709 --> 00:50:31,269
standing 10, 11 ,
12 feet tall.

639
00:50:31,345 --> 00:50:36,044
It's obvious Elliot Richards controlled
this game right from the tip-off.

640
00:50:36,116 --> 00:50:40,553
Right from the get-go, Elliot was
a dominating force in tonight's game.

641
00:50:40,621 --> 00:50:43,784
He was PhiSlammaJamma
runnin' stank all over it. ..

642
00:50:43,857 --> 00:50:46,985
with rib-ticklin' jumps
of double vanilla funk.

643
00:50:47,061 --> 00:50:50,827
Let's take a look.
Here's a pass worthy of John Elway.

644
00:50:50,898 --> 00:50:52,832
For the dunk !
Such a beautiful play.

645
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:57,803
Here he is lining up for the three.
And Ricola ! It's good!

646
00:50:57,871 --> 00:51:00,965
Here comes his patented
over-the-shoulder,
no-look three-pointer.

647
00:51:01,041 --> 00:51:02,906
And nothing but net !

648
00:51:08,415 --> 00:51:11,509
They're in the zone.

649
00:51:11,585 --> 00:51:14,315
Here he is soaring
through the air like the man...

650
00:51:14,388 --> 00:51:16,982
on the flying "trapezius"
and bam !

651
00:51:17,057 --> 00:51:19,890
That's what I'm talking about !

652
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:22,861
Destroying the backboard on the glass.
This kid's an animal.

653
00:51:22,930 --> 00:51:25,990
-Let's take a look at that dunker again.
-It's boom !

654
00:51:26,066 --> 00:51:29,297
Humpty-hump-dump-dump. Ha-ha !

655
00:51:29,369 --> 00:51:32,896
I love this game, folks.
I sure enough do.

656
00:51:32,973 --> 00:51:35,567
Elliot Richards
spitting glass at your ass.

657
00:51:35,642 --> 00:51:38,770
Bob is courtside with Elliot Richards
now. Let's go to Bob Bob.

658
00:51:38,846 --> 00:51:42,213
Thank you, Jerry and Dan.
Elliot, you must be one very
proud young man this evening.

659
00:51:42,282 --> 00:51:45,843
Simply put, that was a staggeringly
dramatic display of athletic ability.

660
00:51:45,919 --> 00:51:49,753
Uh, well, you know,
you go out there and you give 110%.

661
00:51:49,823 --> 00:51:52,519
And you wanna play good.
And you hope you play good.

662
00:51:52,593 --> 00:51:54,823
I think we played
pretty good tonight.

663
00:51:54,895 --> 00:51:58,797
Well, in the lexicon
of sports terminology, and I
don't mean to sound contrary here,

664
00:51:58,866 --> 00:52:03,701
the word "good" falls tragically
short of encompassing the sheer
virtuosity of your performance.

665
00:52:05,405 --> 00:52:08,966
Um, well, you know, there's
no "I" in the word "team"

666
00:52:09,042 --> 00:52:10,976
and this is a team effort.

667
00:52:11,044 --> 00:52:14,070
And I just wanna say that I'm
real proud to be associated with...

668
00:52:14,148 --> 00:52:17,914
these fine individuals that
I have the pleasure of working with.

669
00:52:17,985 --> 00:52:21,148
Now, I would never wanna dis your
team mates in any way, shape or form,

670
00:52:21,221 --> 00:52:24,748
but you do realize that you smashed
Wilt Chamberlain's unbreakable record...

671
00:52:24,825 --> 00:52:28,317
of 100 points in a single
basketball game set in Hershey,
Pennsylvania, years ago ?

672
00:52:28,395 --> 00:52:32,126
Man, you just gotta play one game at
a time and go out there and give 110%...

673
00:52:32,199 --> 00:52:35,828
and you gotta show that you
want it more than they do when
the chips fall where they may.

674
00:52:35,903 --> 00:52:38,701
Thank you very much.
Back to you, Jerry and Dan.

675
00:52:38,772 --> 00:52:41,605
All right ! Diablos !

676
00:52:41,675 --> 00:52:44,624
Number one ! Yeah !

677
00:52:48,061 --> 00:52:50,427
Elliot. Hi.

678
00:52:50,497 --> 00:52:53,830
Alison Gardner.
The Sporting News.

679
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:57,199
- Oh. It's nice to meet you, ma'am.
- [ Chuckles ]

680
00:52:57,270 --> 00:53:00,501
God, I can't tell you
how thrilled I am to meet you.

681
00:53:00,573 --> 00:53:02,973
I was just wondering
if there was a possibility...

682
00:53:03,042 --> 00:53:07,411
you might consider
doing something exclusive with me,
uh, for the magazine ?

683
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:12,281
Maybe more intimate,
one-on-one, just the two of us.

684
00:53:12,352 --> 00:53:16,755
Yeah, right.
I'd kill you in one-on-one.

685
00:53:16,823 --> 00:53:19,121
Shoot !

686
00:53:19,192 --> 00:53:22,093
God, it's so exciting to be here.

687
00:53:22,162 --> 00:53:26,531
I mean, uh, you must have
an enormously huge...

688
00:53:26,599 --> 00:53:28,692
talent to do what you do.

689
00:53:28,768 --> 00:53:32,602
Well, you know, you go out there
and you just give 110%.

690
00:53:32,672 --> 00:53:37,006
And, uh, you hope you play good.
You wanna play good.

691
00:53:37,076 --> 00:53:39,476
- I bet.
- I think we played pretty good tonight.

692
00:53:39,546 --> 00:53:42,481
Oh, God, you were incredible tonight.
I mean, watching you,

693
00:53:42,549 --> 00:53:45,780
I just kept thinking
how unbelievably big...

694
00:53:45,852 --> 00:53:49,083
your, uh, ego must be
after a game like that.

695
00:53:49,155 --> 00:53:51,385
Oh, not that big, really.

696
00:53:51,458 --> 00:53:55,417
- I bet it's pretty big.
- Well, I guess a little bit bigger.

697
00:53:56,496 --> 00:53:59,932
- It depends on how happy I am.
- Oh !

698
00:54:01,701 --> 00:54:04,226
- Whoo. God.
- Heck.

699
00:54:04,304 --> 00:54:08,741
Wanna go back to my place ?
I'll show you my bottle cap collection.

700
00:54:08,808 --> 00:54:12,266
Oh, God, that would--
that would be tremendous.

701
00:54:12,345 --> 00:54:14,370
- All right, well--
- God.

702
00:54:14,447 --> 00:54:17,075
I should, uh--
I should get dressed.

                         54:19,084
I can't wait.

704
00:54:26,359 --> 00:54:30,056
- [ Gasps ] Oh, my God !
- [ Screams ]

705
00:54:30,129 --> 00:54:33,064
Hey, what the hell !

706
00:54:33,132 --> 00:54:35,362
Oh, God, there's--

707
00:54:35,435 --> 00:54:38,199
Hey ! Damn !

708
00:54:38,271 --> 00:54:40,205
- Um--
- Oh, heck !

709
00:54:40,273 --> 00:54:45,336
- Oh !
- I just remembered there's
just this teeny, tiny thing...

710
00:54:45,411 --> 00:54:47,345
- I forgot to do.
- What's teeny ?

711
00:54:47,413 --> 00:54:49,779
- No, no, no.
It's something I have to write.
- About me ?

712
00:54:49,849 --> 00:54:54,013
Yeah, just a little, short,
itty-bitty blurb about tonight's game.

713
00:54:54,087 --> 00:54:56,453
Well, uh, can I see you
after the road trip ?

714
00:54:56,523 --> 00:54:59,924
I would love to, but I'm--
I'm working on a really big,

715
00:54:59,993 --> 00:55:05,454
huge, enormous story on the N.F.L.,
so I probably won't have time.

716
00:55:05,532 --> 00:55:09,400
Oh, shoot. I understand.
You gotta give 110%.

717
00:55:09,469 --> 00:55:11,403
- Right.
- Stay within yourself.

718
00:55:11,471 --> 00:55:15,168
Hey, oh, yeah.
Hey, um, thanks for your time.

719
00:55:17,844 --> 00:55:20,278
So long. Oh--

720
00:55:21,347 --> 00:55:25,215
What the hell ?
Oh, damn the Devil.

721
00:55:25,285 --> 00:55:27,378
Damn the Devil to Hell !

722
00:55:27,453 --> 00:55:30,616
Oh, shoot ! Darn it !

723
00:55:30,690 --> 00:55:33,818
Where the heck did
I put that--

724
00:55:40,199 --> 00:55:43,635
Five, five, five.
[ Growls ]

725
00:55:43,703 --> 00:55:47,161
Seven, seven, seven.
Come on ! Oh !

726
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:49,731
[ Grumbling ]

727
00:55:51,277 --> 00:55:53,438
[ Screams ]

728
00:55:53,513 --> 00:55:55,447
Duh ! Six, six--

729
00:55:57,584 --> 00:56:02,749
- Now what are you doing ?
- You seem so upset, Elliot.
Do you want something to relax ?

730
00:56:02,822 --> 00:56:07,088
You bet I'm upset. You gave me,
like, this little teeny-weeny winkie.

731
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:10,618
Well, that's easily fixed,
you know. Now then, let's see.

732
00:56:10,697 --> 00:56:13,757
Here's some M&Ms
for room 320.

733
00:56:13,833 --> 00:56:17,599
- Red Hots for 316.
- You're giving them candy ?

734
00:56:17,670 --> 00:56:21,834
Placebos. They work just as well as
the real thing. It's a scientific fact.

735
00:56:21,908 --> 00:56:25,036
You can't give sick people
Tic Tacs !

736
00:56:25,111 --> 00:56:28,945
Sick people have notoriously bad breath.
I'm performing a public service here.

737
00:56:29,015 --> 00:56:30,949
Now then,
about your next wish.

738
00:56:33,052 --> 00:56:35,213
All right, okay. Um--

739
00:56:35,288 --> 00:56:38,917
Well, I wanna be smart.

740
00:56:38,992 --> 00:56:43,691
No, I wanna be really smart.
And I wanna be able to talk good-- well.

741
00:56:43,763 --> 00:56:46,527
- What is the word--

Actually, the word "geneva" --

Every time I've reread
Camus and Sartre,

"Why does the existential dilemma
have to be so damn bleak ?"

- Yes, we're alone in the universe.

last night when I was lying in jail,
I was talking to this guy,

I realized that wishing

to think that...

it really isn't that important
how far we go in life anyway.

Um, so listen, I'd be happy
to hook these up for you...

1195
01:25:53,808 --> 01:25:57,574

if you wanted, you know,
while you're unpacking.

1196
01:25:57,645 --> 01:26:00,375
I could make us some dinner.
That way you wouldn't have to cook.

 To just feel better
To just feel better about today
