it's great here.

Ted, while I agree that in time
our band will be most triumphant,

32

the truth is, Wyld Stallyns

Ted, it's pointless to have

before we even have
decent instruments.

That is why we need Eddie Van Halen.

- in the year 470 B.C.
- Hi, long time no see.

970
01:15:00,454 --> 01:15:02,580
A time when much of the world

971
01:15:02,748 --> 01:15:06,083
looked like the cover of the
Led Zeppelin album Houses ofthe Holy.

972
01:15:06,251 --> 01:15:07,793
We were there.

973
01:15:07,961 --> 01:15:11,797
There were many steps and columns,
it was most tranquil.

974
01:15:11,965 --> 01:15:15,718
He is sometimes known
as the father of modern thought.

975
01:15:15,886 --> 01:15:19,764
He was the teacher of Plato, who was in
turn the teacher of Aristotle.

976
01:15:19,932 --> 01:15:25,436
And like Ozzy Osbourne, was repeatedly
accused of corruption of the young.

977
01:15:25,604 --> 01:15:28,606
And since he doesn't speak English,
my friend Ted here,

978
01:15:28,774 --> 01:15:30,608
is going to interpret for him.

979
01:15:30,776 --> 01:15:33,569
So please welcome,
to tell us what he thinks of San Dimas,

980
01:15:33,737 --> 01:15:37,406
the most bodacious philosophizer
in Ancient Greece...

981
01:15:37,950 --> 01:15:39,617
[both]... Socrates!

982
01:15:39,785 --> 01:15:42,119
[Applause]

983
01:15:42,287 --> 01:15:45,540
...is totally out of control. I got
a good idea where he gets it from.

984
01:15:45,707 --> 01:15:48,668
I mean if you and that wife of yours
would show a little discipline

985
01:15:48,835 --> 01:15:50,753
maybe your son wouldn't be
such a bad influence.

986
01:15:50,921 --> 01:15:52,713
Is discipline your key
to the success with Ted?

987
01:15:52,881 --> 01:15:55,633
Yes, it is! He's going to an
Alaskan military school.

988
01:15:55,801 --> 01:15:59,136
[Ted] He loves you best...

989
01:16:01,640 --> 01:16:03,307
...in all the world.

990
01:16:04,268 --> 01:16:05,685
What are they doing up there?

991
01:16:07,229 --> 01:16:08,312
He also loves...

992
01:16:09,773 --> 01:16:11,107
...baseball!

993
01:16:12,150 --> 01:16:15,820
[Freud] Therefore, Ted's father's
own fear of failure

994
01:16:15,988 --> 01:16:18,114
has caused him to make his son

995
01:16:18,282 --> 01:16:20,658
the embodiment of all of his own

996
01:16:20,826 --> 01:16:25,162
deepest anxieties about himself.

997
01:16:25,330 --> 01:16:30,167
And, hence, his aggression
transference onto Ted.

998
01:16:32,546 --> 01:16:35,590
- Whoa!
- OK, Ted?

999
01:16:37,843 --> 01:16:40,928
Yes, thank you very much,
Sigmund Freud.

1000
01:16:42,347 --> 01:16:43,681
Hm?

1001
01:16:44,725 --> 01:16:47,560
Nah, just got a minor Oedipal complex.

1002
01:16:49,688 --> 01:16:52,315
It is indeed a pleasure
to introduce to you

1003
01:16:52,482 --> 01:16:57,737
a gentleman we picked up in
Medieval Mongolia in the year 1269.

1004
01:16:57,904 --> 01:17:01,365
Please welcome
the very excellent barbarian...

1005
01:17:01,533 --> 01:17:04,160
[both]... Mr. Genghis Khan.

[Cheering]

1007

[Ted] This is a dude who, 700 years ago,
totally ravaged China.

1008
01:17:12,961 --> 01:17:14,837
And who we are told, two hours ago,

1009
01:17:15,005 --> 01:17:17,632
totally ravaged
Oshman's Sporting Goods.

1010
01:17:20,052 --> 01:17:23,679
A most bodacious soldier,
and general,

1011
01:17:23,847 --> 01:17:27,516
Ms. Of Arc totally rousted
the English from France.

1012
01:17:27,684 --> 01:17:31,187
And then turned this dude,
Dauphin, into a king

1013
01:17:31,355 --> 01:17:34,065
and all this
by the time she was 17.

Genghis very much enjoys Twinkies

1018
01:17:56,672 --> 01:17:58,756
because of the excellent sugar rush.

1019
01:17:58,924 --> 01:18:01,801
He also loves billiards.

1020
01:18:04,096 --> 01:18:07,390
[Bill] Beethoven's favorite works
include Mozart's "Requiem,"

1021
01:18:07,557 --> 01:18:11,894
Handel's "Messiah,"
and Bon Jovi's Slippery When Wet.

[Ted] To improve on the condition
of her armies,

1023
01:18:14,606 --> 01:18:18,776
Joan of Arc plans on instituting
a full scale aerobics program

1024
01:18:18,944 --> 01:18:20,778
on her return to France.

1025
01:18:20,946 --> 01:18:22,988
I don't think it's gonna work.

in American history...

I mean, we met lots of great leaders,

1063

on our history report...

And something called credit cards.
