<i>[Guy Narrating] I'm not that good
at a lot of stuff.</i>

3
00:00:53,001 --> 00:00:55,773
<i>Especially thinking things through.</i>

4
00:00:58,699 --> 00:01:01,035
<i>And that's why this plan was so shitty.</i>

5
00:01:05,555 --> 00:01:07,461
<i>But my feelings were hurt...</i>

6
00:01:07,508 --> 00:01:10,242
<i>and I'm glad I at least did something
about it.</i>

7
00:01:15,141 --> 00:01:17,875
<i>Making bad decisions is nothing
new to me.</i>

8
00:01:18,648 --> 00:01:21,881
<i>After all I live alone, at 40...</i>

9
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:24,133
<i>and I make my living proofreading...</i>

10
00:01:24,507 --> 00:01:26,243
<i>product warranties.</i>

11
00:01:27,539 --> 00:01:29,272
<i>A few weeks ago I took a break from
that however...</i>

12
00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:31,188
<i>so I could do this whole thing.</i>

13
00:01:32,236 --> 00:01:33,867
<i>And it's pretty ironic that what I did...</i>

14
00:01:33,938 --> 00:01:36,060
<i>was exactly what a child would do.</i>

15
00:01:36,953 --> 00:01:40,003
<i>I threw a tantrum just to get attention.</i>

16
00:01:41,258 --> 00:01:42,758
<i>[Parent at bee]Really proud.</i>

17
00:01:43,402 --> 00:01:45,344
I mean I am...

18
00:01:46,171 --> 00:01:47,734
and excited.

19
00:01:48,828 --> 00:01:50,840
Meet the big man, right.

20
00:01:52,797 --> 00:01:53,897
But...

21
00:01:53,945 --> 00:01:56,225
you know, proud either way, of course.

22
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:00,150
Aren't they amazing?

23
00:02:00,188 --> 00:02:02,508
- Which ones yours? Mine's the...
- No thank you!

24
00:02:02,727 --> 00:02:03,734
What's that?

25
00:02:03,781 --> 00:02:05,458
This chat, I'm all set.

26
00:02:05,501 --> 00:02:08,391
Just trying to get some food in my face
before I get stuck on that stage, okay?!

27
00:02:09,938 --> 00:02:13,563
Oh, right, my bad. You must be our
host for today.

28
00:02:13,617 --> 00:02:15,411
No, I'm not.

29
00:02:15,945 --> 00:02:17,445
I'm the winner!

30
00:02:17,769 --> 00:02:22,821
Everyone, it's time for the 15th
annual regional spelling bee to begin.

31
00:02:22,867 --> 00:02:25,511
Take your seats please all of our
noble contestants.

32
00:02:25,555 --> 00:02:29,055
Please take your seats up on the stage.

33
00:02:29,098 --> 00:02:30,668
Right on schedule.

34
00:02:37,342 --> 00:02:40,616
I love the way a hush comes
over the crowd before we start.

35
00:02:48,547 --> 00:02:50,634
What are you doing up on the
stage weirdo?!

36
00:02:53,785 --> 00:02:55,825
Your chair called me for help.

37
00:02:58,558 --> 00:03:00,058
Help me.

38
00:03:01,164 --> 00:03:02,664
He's too heavy.

39
00:03:04,061 --> 00:03:06,680
You didn't hear that? I heard it.

40
00:03:08,263 --> 00:03:10,021
I'm sorry sir.

41
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:13,424
Those seats are for competitors only.

42
00:03:13,533 --> 00:03:15,949
Great! I'm in the right spot.

43
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,936
Mr. Trilby, I won't allow it. You're
not eligible in any fashion...

44
00:03:22,979 --> 00:03:25,063
way, shape or manner.

45
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:28,830
Page 39 of the Golden Quill National
Spelling Bee rule book.

46
00:03:28,873 --> 00:03:31,953
This is rule number 24, this is
sub point B.

47
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,500
This is a quote...

48
00:03:33,729 --> 00:03:35,710
Speller must not have passed
beyond the 8th grade...

49
00:03:35,753 --> 00:03:38,615
on or before February 1st, 2011.

50
00:03:38,693 --> 00:03:41,334
That is a rule written by the
governing institute...

51
00:03:41,467 --> 00:03:43,929
and if you want you can continue to
ogle my transcript...

52
00:03:44,022 --> 00:03:45,449
just please don't wrinkle it
any further...

53
00:03:45,493 --> 00:03:46,734
but you can see that unfortunately...

54
00:03:46,781 --> 00:03:51,044
I have not passed the 8th grade on or
before Feb. 1st. Not ever.

55
00:03:51,091 --> 00:03:53,070
- That may be.
- Sir I can go on...

56
00:03:53,221 --> 00:03:57,657
I can go on and on and on. There are
83 paragraphs, 581 lines of rules...

57
00:03:57,703 --> 00:04:00,813
in the rulebook. But let me assure you I'm
compliant with every single one of them.

58
00:04:00,867 --> 00:04:03,404
The spelling bee, isn't it for kids...

59
00:04:03,447 --> 00:04:07,331
not adults that couldn't even
graduate 8th grade!

60
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,455
Oh boy. Are we passed the rules and
into the insults now...

61
00:04:10,498 --> 00:04:11,602
- is it insult time...
- Well I'm sorry.

62
00:04:11,645 --> 00:04:15,218
because your pot-holder vest is about
to take heavy fire. You ready for that?

63
00:04:15,261 --> 00:04:16,561
You know what, enough!

64
00:04:16,593 --> 00:04:18,511
This is all just a moot point.

65
00:04:18,683 --> 00:04:20,703
Every contestant must be
sponsored by...

66
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:23,718
a nationally recognized news service.

67
00:04:23,794 --> 00:04:24,516
The end!

68
00:04:24,559 --> 00:04:26,403
I understand, but that doesn't end
the conversation...

69
00:04:26,446 --> 00:04:28,053
- Guess what.
- [Jenny] Hello.

70
00:04:28,098 --> 00:04:29,298
- Hey.
- Perfect timing.

71
00:04:29,321 --> 00:04:30,136
- What's going on here?
- Well...

72
00:04:30,191 --> 00:04:31,691
- Who's this?
- This is my sponsor.

73
00:04:31,695 --> 00:04:33,665
From a nationally recognized
news service.

74
00:04:33,717 --> 00:04:35,365
Jenny Widgeon, the Click and Scroll.

75
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:36,178
The What?!

76
00:04:36,297 --> 00:04:37,635
What's that? Is it something on
the computer?

77
00:04:37,691 --> 00:04:38,991
Yes we're an online paper.

78
00:04:39,086 --> 00:04:41,351
Said differently, a nationally
recognized news service.

79
00:04:41,394 --> 00:04:43,680
They don't want to let me participate.

80
00:04:43,781 --> 00:04:45,745
Go ahead, set it in motion.
I love your vest.

81
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:48,578
In about a half an hour, you're gonna
be receiving...

82
00:04:48,633 --> 00:04:50,133
a temporary restraining order and...

83
00:04:50,214 --> 00:04:52,058
a preliminary injunction prohibiting...

84
00:04:52,112 --> 00:04:53,612
the continuation of this competition...

85
00:04:53,651 --> 00:04:55,151
until we clear this legal matter up!

86
00:04:55,289 --> 00:04:57,267
- Plus, and this is a selfish one for me...
- Legal matter?!

87
00:04:57,326 --> 00:04:59,610
- It's gonna make one hell of a story.
- How dare you try to hijack...

88
00:04:59,653 --> 00:05:00,753
this spelling bee contest!

89
00:05:00,769 --> 00:05:01,869
What did you call me?!

90
00:05:01,931 --> 00:05:04,077
- Hijack!
- Hijack? I'm a hijacker now?

91
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:05,454
You're on the hook for defamation too.

92
00:05:05,517 --> 00:05:07,241
My attorney's will be in touch with
both of you...

93
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,864
Let's get out of here. But before we
go actually...

94
00:05:08,911 --> 00:05:12,268
I'd like to watch the both of you address
those poor wonderful children...

95
00:05:12,311 --> 00:05:14,844
and their very supportive parents,
when you tell them...

96
00:05:14,891 --> 00:05:16,954
that they have no shot at the
national bee...

97
00:05:16,997 --> 00:05:18,870
or an opportunity to meet the big man.

98
00:05:18,913 --> 00:05:20,235
That I want to see. They're going to
be crestfallen.

99
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:21,939
I know of one father in particular
who's gonna have to find...

100
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:23,510
a whole new way to empty out
his ball bag.

101
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:25,818
Let's do it. Bullies and insulters
first. You lead the way.

102
00:05:25,927 --> 00:05:26,841
Or should I go first?

103
00:05:26,906 --> 00:05:28,633
The idiot hijacker. Should I lead?

104
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,617
- You lead.
- No one called you an idiot.

105
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:32,173
While you decide I'm gonna bang out
a couple of prayers.

106
00:05:32,228 --> 00:05:33,228
Which way is Mecca?

107
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:34,566
Oleaginous.

108
00:05:34,594 --> 00:05:35,894
Oleaginous?

109
00:05:35,953 --> 00:05:37,253
Oleaginous!

110
00:05:37,266 --> 00:05:38,766
Oleaginous?

111
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:40,363
Can I have the definition please?

112
00:05:40,641 --> 00:05:44,160
Having the nature or quality of oil...

113
00:05:44,286 --> 00:05:45,300
or...

114
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:48,487
 unctuous, prawning, smarmy.

115
00:05:51,086 --> 00:05:52,486
Oleaginous.

116
00:05:52,539 --> 00:05:54,039
Oleaginous.

117
00:05:54,266 --> 00:05:56,484
Does it come from the Latin Oleo
meaning olive?

118
00:05:56,914 --> 00:05:58,414
It does.

119
00:05:59,234 --> 00:06:00,242
Oleaginous.

120
00:06:00,289 --> 00:06:01,789
Can I have the part of speech?

121
00:06:01,929 --> 00:06:03,329
It's an adjective.

122
00:06:03,422 --> 00:06:04,922
Am I right?

123
00:06:06,227 --> 00:06:07,727
Yes.

124
00:06:07,766 --> 00:06:09,620
- Any other pronunciations?
- No!

125
00:06:11,969 --> 00:06:13,369
Oleaginous.

126
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:17,471
O-L-E-A-G-I-N-O-U-S.

127
00:06:17,586 --> 00:06:19,625
- That is correct!
- [Guy] You got it!

128
00:06:27,789 --> 00:06:29,289
Hi.

129
00:06:29,297 --> 00:06:31,461
Absquatulate.

130
00:06:33,102 --> 00:06:37,289
A-B-S-Q-U-A-T-U-L-A-T-E

131
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:39,979
That's...

132
00:06:40,227 --> 00:06:41,727
Correct!

133
00:06:42,613 --> 00:06:44,164
- Correct.
- Thank you.

134
00:06:44,211 --> 00:06:46,901
Hey moms, let's break out the rubber
pillowcases tonight...

135
00:06:46,983 --> 00:06:49,771
little pricks are gonna be counting
tears, not sheep.

136
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:52,632
Who's next!

137
00:06:53,961 --> 00:06:57,461
BAD WORDS

138
00:08:17,085 --> 00:08:18,585
Not now, please.

139
00:08:18,852 --> 00:08:21,533
- Guy, I need some more.
- No!

140
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:23,868
- Why at the age of 40...
- C'mon.

141
00:08:23,939 --> 00:08:26,828
have you decided to annoy educators,
parents and children...

142
00:08:26,867 --> 00:08:29,143
by forcing your way into a kids
spelling bee?

143
00:08:29,236 --> 00:08:30,436
Can't you see I'm trying to sleep?!

144
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:32,578
Guy, I get at least one answer
per tournament.

145
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:35,236
I have 3, very paltry answers...

146
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:36,402
it's time for my 4th.

147
00:08:36,445 --> 00:08:38,172
- [Guy] Shh.

148
00:08:39,656 --> 00:08:41,156
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

149
00:08:41,335 --> 00:08:43,314
While I'm gone I want you to ask
yourself this...

150
00:08:43,376 --> 00:08:47,547
will, when all of this is over, a 5
answer article...

151
00:08:47,594 --> 00:08:50,234
be equal compensation for 8 weeks...

152
00:08:50,281 --> 00:08:52,291
of covered hotel room accommodations...

153
00:08:52,377 --> 00:08:54,073
qualifying tournament entry fees...

154
00:08:54,142 --> 00:08:56,401
rental car damage, not to mention
emotional expense.

155
00:08:56,455 --> 00:08:59,250
- Are you not gonna get up?!
- What? Go you got room.

156
00:08:59,293 --> 00:09:00,616
- Jesus...Christ!
- If you'd given me the window...

157
00:09:00,659 --> 00:09:02,251
- I wouldn't have to move.
- Yeah.

158
00:09:02,398 --> 00:09:04,852
- Don't drag that thing across me!
- Excuse me.

159
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:10,109
It's full. You just told me it's full.
I don't want it on me.

160
00:09:19,486 --> 00:09:21,322
Hi, I'm Chaitanya Chopra.

161
00:09:26,099 --> 00:09:27,399
Was that English?

162
00:09:27,427 --> 00:09:29,066
My name is Chaitanya.

163
00:09:29,191 --> 00:09:30,491
Oh.

164
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,900
Congratulations.

165
00:09:31,943 --> 00:09:33,143
- What's yours?
- No!

166
00:09:33,188 --> 00:09:34,898
- What's your name?
- Spin it around!

167
00:09:35,121 --> 00:09:37,267
- I'm going to Quill.
- Good for you.

168
00:09:37,383 --> 00:09:38,930
My dad's up in first class.

169
00:09:38,977 --> 00:09:41,250
- Great.
- My dad says that economy class...

170
00:09:41,305 --> 00:09:42,852
- builds character.
- Amazing.

171
00:09:43,234 --> 00:09:44,945
I was in last years tournament.

172
00:09:45,047 --> 00:09:47,090
I overheard you say you're going too.

173
00:09:47,449 --> 00:09:48,949
You're the one who's competing, huh?

174
00:09:49,775 --> 00:09:52,031
I read about you. What was the
winning word?

175
00:09:52,539 --> 00:09:53,664
I don't know.

176
00:09:53,716 --> 00:09:55,813
What was the word you spelled to
win your regional?

177
00:09:55,859 --> 00:09:58,336
- To get here.
- I don't fucking remember!

178
00:09:58,453 --> 00:09:59,853
Do you see my eyes closed?!

179
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:01,344
Mine was intelligentsia.

180
00:10:01,398 --> 00:10:03,362
- Awesome.
- C'mon, try.

181
00:10:03,472 --> 00:10:06,000
How could you forget. It's such a
special word.

182
00:10:16,445 --> 00:10:18,677
It was auto-fellatio. Okay?

183
00:10:20,209 --> 00:10:22,048
- I never heard of that word.
- Yeah.

184
00:10:22,141 --> 00:10:23,695
What is the origin?

185
00:10:24,038 --> 00:10:25,538
Loneliness.

186
00:10:26,002 --> 00:10:27,916
Well, that can't be right!

187
00:10:27,963 --> 00:10:28,863
It is.

188
00:10:28,881 --> 00:10:32,096
I know "auto" is of Greek origin
meaning self, right?

189
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:37,141
Fellatio, fellatio, fellatio...

190
00:10:38,768 --> 00:10:41,643
Is that derived from the Latin
"fellare" meaning to suck?

191
00:10:41,979 --> 00:10:43,479
Little man...

192
00:10:43,577 --> 00:10:44,877
the woman I'm sitting next to...

193
00:10:44,907 --> 00:10:46,440
knows her way around that subject
real well...

194
00:10:46,483 --> 00:10:48,380
so why don't you ask her when she
gets back from dropping her deuce...

195
00:10:48,456 --> 00:10:50,861
Meanwhile, if you don't point
that curry hole...

196
00:10:50,924 --> 00:10:53,352
that way and sit your fucking ass
down in that seat...

197
00:10:53,398 --> 00:10:55,555
I'm gonna tell the captain that your
bags ticking.

198
00:10:55,602 --> 00:10:57,680
Think you'll have a situation.

199
00:10:58,039 --> 00:10:59,539
Goodnight.

200
00:11:23,734 --> 00:11:25,234
Have a seat.

201
00:11:27,992 --> 00:11:29,392
I'm Bernice Deagan...

202
00:11:29,423 --> 00:11:32,115
director of the Golden Quill
national spelling bee.

203
00:11:33,189 --> 00:11:34,689
Struthious.

204
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:36,635
What'd she say?

205
00:11:36,678 --> 00:11:39,674
S-T-R-U-T-H-I-O-U-S, struthious.

206
00:11:40,788 --> 00:11:42,438
That was my winning word.

207
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,523
Oh.

208
00:11:43,578 --> 00:11:45,830
1973, national champion.

209
00:11:46,752 --> 00:11:48,830
Just thought you should know that in
case you didn't already.

210
00:11:48,908 --> 00:11:50,408
No I didn't.

211
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:52,440
Guy...

212
00:11:52,484 --> 00:11:53,626
- I don't like you.

213
00:11:53,669 --> 00:11:55,169
- [Jenny] Look.
- Quiet!

214
00:11:56,261 --> 00:11:58,047
You know when I was a little girl...

215
00:11:58,386 --> 00:12:00,305
I was always picked last in PE.

216
00:12:00,641 --> 00:12:02,041
I hated sports.

217
00:12:02,126 --> 00:12:03,526
That's what probably, thankfully...

218
00:12:03,531 --> 00:12:05,913
thrusted me into the welcoming bosom
of the spelling bee..

219
00:12:05,956 --> 00:12:08,867
of which I am the director and have
been for over 20 years now.

220
00:12:09,086 --> 00:12:10,586
How did I accomplish that?

221
00:12:11,008 --> 00:12:13,509
Elbow grease, yes, hard work, maybe...

222
00:12:13,611 --> 00:12:15,609
integrity, oh you betcha.

223
00:12:15,925 --> 00:12:19,190
But what I didn't do is use slimy
gimmicks as you have done.

224
00:12:19,299 --> 00:12:21,649
Well you don't know me and you don't
know why I'm here.

225
00:12:21,735 --> 00:12:23,235
Would you like to tell me?

226
00:12:23,445 --> 00:12:24,545
No thank you.

227
00:12:24,571 --> 00:12:26,071
Do you know why he's here?

228
00:12:26,241 --> 00:12:28,937
Oh, I have been trying for weeks.

229
00:12:29,272 --> 00:12:30,472
Alright.

230
00:12:30,524 --> 00:12:33,231
Well whatever issue it is you're here
to work out...

231
00:12:33,274 --> 00:12:35,689
perhaps painful 5th grade spelling
bee or...

232
00:12:35,783 --> 00:12:36,413
It's not that.

233
00:12:36,466 --> 00:12:37,766
I'm not asking!

234
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:40,236
I'm simply telling you you're in
the wrong place.

235
00:12:40,463 --> 00:12:42,051
No this is the spot.

236
00:12:42,129 --> 00:12:44,058
I'm gonna be out of your hair
in 3 days though.

237
00:12:44,766 --> 00:12:46,166
Perhaps sooner.

238
00:12:46,188 --> 00:12:49,260
Because however smart you think you are
with this loophole your snaking through...

239
00:12:49,307 --> 00:12:52,744
I'll bet you're not half as smart as
even our worst speller.

240
00:12:53,054 --> 00:12:56,101
So B-R-A-V-O Mr. Trilby.

241
00:12:56,241 --> 00:12:57,297
You've made it.

242
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:59,180
That one I know. It's bravo.

243
00:13:00,736 --> 00:13:02,711
All the way to your own hanging.

244
00:13:03,563 --> 00:13:05,199
Your noose. Enjoy.

245
00:13:05,867 --> 00:13:07,367
Can I ask you a question?

246
00:13:07,627 --> 00:13:10,388
On your wife’s birthday, does she
get to wear the strap-on...

247
00:13:10,431 --> 00:13:12,852
or do you hog that thing 365?

248
00:13:12,898 --> 00:13:15,280
- That's yours right. You hold onto that.
- Good day!

249
00:13:15,323 --> 00:13:17,716
- You don't share that with anybody.
- Good day!

250
00:13:18,797 --> 00:13:21,555
- I thank you very much.
- Oh you can thank Dr. Bowman.

251
00:13:21,886 --> 00:13:24,583
He was very disappointed he couldn't
personally place that...

252
00:13:24,669 --> 00:13:25,883
around your throat.

253
00:13:25,968 --> 00:13:29,139
Oh yeah. Is he busy doing
something more pleasurable...

254
00:13:29,186 --> 00:13:30,313
with another guy's throat?

255
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:33,252
He is in the middle of a very
important media training session.

256
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:35,522
Surely you're aware that your little
stunt has landed...

257
00:13:35,576 --> 00:13:38,244
on the very first year we're
televising this tournament!

258
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:39,938
Hang on...

259
00:13:40,172 --> 00:13:41,792
That is a coincidence.

260
00:13:42,042 --> 00:13:43,687
It doesn't bother you that...

261
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:46,648
a few million people will witness
your embarrassment?

262
00:13:46,695 --> 00:13:48,922
I'm not gonna be the one with the red
face. Trust me.

263
00:13:49,022 --> 00:13:50,522
I'm not here for that.

264
00:13:51,445 --> 00:13:52,945
Okay.

265
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:54,499
Okay.

266
00:13:55,436 --> 00:13:57,117
See you later.

267
00:13:57,164 --> 00:14:00,570
Oh, and I personally arranged
your hotel accommodations.

268
00:14:00,921 --> 00:14:02,989
- I bet they're not awesome.
- They're not!

269
00:14:04,263 --> 00:14:05,934
Nice to meet you.

270
00:14:09,554 --> 00:14:12,610
<i>[Guy narrating]I had plenty of
opportunities to stop what I was doing.</i>

271
00:14:13,012 --> 00:14:14,657
<i>To make a good decision.</i>

272
00:14:15,672 --> 00:14:19,295
<i>But that would have required the kind
of lessons I was never taught.</i>

273
00:14:21,534 --> 00:14:24,666
Oh, um, there's an ice-cream social
at 5:30pm.

274
00:14:26,616 --> 00:14:27,398
You gonna be there?

275
00:14:27,441 --> 00:14:28,742
Ok, no, well...

276
00:14:28,801 --> 00:14:30,719
I could be pretty late to that.

277
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:31,935
Really late.

278
00:14:31,978 --> 00:14:33,478
Super late!

279
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,508
Meet me there though.

280
00:14:34,563 --> 00:14:36,081
- Here's your key Mr. Trible.
- Thank you.

281
00:14:36,433 --> 00:14:39,051
- Ma’am, I'll be right back with yours.
- Oh, bummer.

282
00:14:39,184 --> 00:14:40,684
See ya.

283
00:14:41,945 --> 00:14:43,445
[Chaitanya] Hold the door!

284
00:14:48,258 --> 00:14:49,776
Hey, pool side too.

285
00:14:52,664 --> 00:14:54,466
Did you remember your winning word?

286
00:14:55,576 --> 00:14:56,990
I'm Chaitanya, remember?

287
00:14:57,041 --> 00:14:58,541
I can't do it again, Shwarma.

288
00:14:58,687 --> 00:15:00,187
Chaitanya.

289
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:03,271
How about just your favorite word.

290
00:15:03,326 --> 00:15:05,516
I'm serious pal.

291
00:15:05,586 --> 00:15:07,930
- You don't have one?
- I don't. Nope, sorry.

292
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:11,023
Mine is subjugate.

293
00:15:11,105 --> 00:15:13,100
It just sounds so cool, you know.

294
00:15:13,195 --> 00:15:14,695
Subjugate.

295
00:15:15,216 --> 00:15:17,000
Subjugate.

296
00:15:17,648 --> 00:15:19,366
Subjugate.

297
00:15:20,494 --> 00:15:21,894
What's yours?

298
00:15:21,924 --> 00:15:23,783
Can we shut the fuck up?!

299
00:15:24,183 --> 00:15:27,491
Well, that's four words. A
sentence really.

300
00:15:28,228 --> 00:15:29,577
Pretend you're on a desert island...

301
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:31,134
and this gorilla comes out of
the jungle...

302
00:15:31,243 --> 00:15:32,755
he holds a gun to your head and says...

303
00:15:32,798 --> 00:15:34,845
hoo hoo, tell me what your favorite
word is.

304
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:36,092
- What would you say?
- Sweet fuck!

305
00:15:36,136 --> 00:15:38,699
- We got a gorilla with a gun!
- Yeah a gorilla with a gun.

306
00:15:38,778 --> 00:15:41,259
- And he's on a desert island?
- He's standing right there.

307
00:15:41,321 --> 00:15:43,290
Here's what I'd do. I'd kick some sand
in the monkey's face...

308
00:15:43,392 --> 00:15:44,610
I'd take his gun and hunt you down...

309
00:15:44,653 --> 00:15:46,164
I'd stick it in your mouth and
I'd tell you...

310
00:15:46,207 --> 00:15:48,775
to stop trying to get all up in
my kitchen, kid.

311
00:15:48,818 --> 00:15:51,722
Again, that's a sentence. We can
finish that later.

312
00:15:51,792 --> 00:15:53,292
Bye bye.

313
00:16:05,328 --> 00:16:06,336
Come on.

314
00:16:06,398 --> 00:16:09,711
Unfortunately the hotel is
completely sold out.

315
00:16:10,155 --> 00:16:11,953
I don't have a bathroom.

316
00:16:12,227 --> 00:16:13,727
Yeah.

317
00:16:16,195 --> 00:16:18,961
Where would the hotel like me to
put my piss and shit?

318
00:16:27,016 --> 00:16:36,664
<i>[Sportscaster on tv
describing event]</i>

319
00:16:36,711 --> 00:16:38,398
- Bartender.
- Yes?

320
00:16:38,913 --> 00:16:40,491
Do you know how to make an
old fashioned?

321
00:16:40,555 --> 00:16:42,055
- Sure.
- Okay.

322
00:16:42,742 --> 00:16:44,242
Actually make that two.

323
00:16:48,388 --> 00:16:49,888
No mini-bar huh?

324
00:16:50,156 --> 00:16:52,218
They put me in a storage closet.

325
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:56,015
I think the queen bee is sending
you a message.

326
00:16:57,063 --> 00:16:58,563
Whatever.

327
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:00,664
Oh, god.

328
00:17:02,109 --> 00:17:03,680
A lot of parents around here.

329
00:17:05,656 --> 00:17:08,272
I'm bursting at the seems with parents.

330
00:17:09,773 --> 00:17:11,273
[Bartender] Here you go.

331
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:14,175
- Where are your parents?
- Jenny, c'mon.

332
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:15,739
I just wanna have a drink in peace.

333
00:17:16,071 --> 00:17:18,539
Okay? And can I give you a little
journalistic advice?

334
00:17:19,186 --> 00:17:20,686
Don't try so hard.

335
00:17:20,747 --> 00:17:22,542
Get on the clock. We're here 3 days.

336
00:17:22,636 --> 00:17:24,314
So just, you know...

337
00:17:24,368 --> 00:17:26,290
Difficult to talk when you're
being smothered.

338
00:17:27,558 --> 00:17:29,844
You're an insolent child.

339
00:17:29,997 --> 00:17:31,945
Hiding secrets from his mommy.

340
00:17:31,992 --> 00:17:34,751
Really, you're not half the broad my
mother was, so...

341
00:17:35,406 --> 00:17:36,906
or is.

342
00:17:42,733 --> 00:17:44,233
Seat opened up.

343
00:17:45,862 --> 00:17:49,179
I don't wanna talk and I don't wanna
drink I'm dead serious.

344
00:17:49,227 --> 00:17:51,304
Either you leave or I'm going to.

345
00:17:51,562 --> 00:17:55,779
Or you could stay. I could buy you
yet another dinner.

346
00:17:55,822 --> 00:17:56,542
No!

347
00:17:56,585 --> 00:18:00,758
You could expand on those 3 measely
answers that you've given me this far.

348
00:18:00,898 --> 00:18:02,402
You know too much already.

349
00:18:05,762 --> 00:18:08,205
Hold on a second.

350
00:18:08,439 --> 00:18:13,208
Wild turkey. Olive green. 32A.

351
00:18:14,321 --> 00:18:18,930
Favorite drink, color and breast size,
are first date questions.

352
00:18:18,977 --> 00:18:22,005
Or maybe you've never been on one
of those?

353
00:18:22,122 --> 00:18:23,747
Can you leave me alone.

354
00:18:23,805 --> 00:18:25,305
I've asked you like 4 or 5 times.

355
00:18:25,336 --> 00:18:27,476
Why don't you tell me why you're
so angry with the world.

356
00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:29,328
Just, c'mon. Go ahead.

357
00:18:29,956 --> 00:18:32,484
Screw! Please.

358
00:18:40,142 --> 00:18:42,102
- Screw?
- Screw!

359
00:18:43,203 --> 00:18:44,807
Fuck off. Did it.

360
00:18:45,018 --> 00:18:48,785
Did you just tire of the words,
"fuck off" ?

361
00:18:48,917 --> 00:18:52,813
Because I know you're not suggesting
I let you fuck me again.

362
00:18:54,359 --> 00:18:57,859
First of all, you're welcome.

363
00:18:58,375 --> 00:19:02,256
If you'd like me to consider
another "event"...

364
00:19:02,779 --> 00:19:05,096
with you, you can ask me nicely.

365
00:19:06,951 --> 00:19:11,039
And secondly, "fuck off" works just
great if that's what you prefer.

366
00:19:11,082 --> 00:19:12,747
Does that sound better to you?

367
00:19:13,675 --> 00:19:15,563
Or does "screw" sound pretty nice?

368
00:19:32,332 --> 00:19:33,916
- Alright?
- We're doing great.

369
00:19:33,976 --> 00:19:35,476
Okay.

370
00:19:35,758 --> 00:19:37,832
Ooh, yeah.

371
00:19:37,895 --> 00:19:39,395
- Do not look at me!
- Okay.

372
00:19:40,563 --> 00:19:41,789
Do not look at me!

373
00:19:41,852 --> 00:19:43,152
You're fucking staring at me,
you know.

374
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:44,680
It's kinda creepy.

375
00:19:48,414 --> 00:19:50,396
Don't look at me. DON'T LOOK AT ME!

376
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:52,646
Don't look at me. I'll have to start
again.

377
00:19:52,689 --> 00:19:53,689
- I understand.

378
00:19:53,753 --> 00:19:55,445
- Faster!
- Okay.

379
00:19:55,712 --> 00:19:57,219
We could be here all night.

380
00:19:57,266 --> 00:19:58,766
Build it up.

381
00:19:59,155 --> 00:20:00,655
Climbing a mountain.

382
00:20:02,899 --> 00:20:04,399
One foot in front of the other.

383
00:20:07,675 --> 00:20:09,227
Now we're jogging.

384
00:20:09,882 --> 00:20:11,437
Now we're jogging.

385
00:20:11,984 --> 00:20:12,984
Who wants to run?

386
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:15,884
DON'T LOOK AT ME! Do you want me
to grab your balls?

387
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:17,087
Do you want me to stick my fingers
in your asshole?

388
00:20:17,128 --> 00:20:18,718
SHUT THE FUCK UP!

389
00:20:26,076 --> 00:20:27,576
Don't look at me!

390
00:20:28,883 --> 00:20:31,179
Ugh... Wow!

391
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:33,960
So, second time.

392
00:20:34,101 --> 00:20:35,101
Shame on me.

393
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,603
Well I had a good time too. Thanks.

394
00:20:40,226 --> 00:20:41,626
So if I need fresh towels in
the morning...

395
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,326
I should just, put my name on
this?

396
00:20:45,688 --> 00:20:46,888
Okay.

397
00:20:46,961 --> 00:20:48,361
I'll see you tomorrow.

398
00:20:48,422 --> 00:20:50,411
- So whatever, yeah.
- Bye.

399
00:21:15,057 --> 00:21:17,172
You know, if you really had it
all together...

400
00:21:17,349 --> 00:21:19,031
you wouldn't be leaving your under...

401
00:21:19,305 --> 00:21:22,307
Sorry to bother you, but the lady
said you were still awake.

402
00:21:22,822 --> 00:21:25,151
Would you mind helping me open
this jar of pretzels?

403
00:21:26,515 --> 00:21:27,615
Wow!

404
00:21:27,687 --> 00:21:29,404
Small room.

405
00:21:31,571 --> 00:21:34,844
Can you help me? I haven't had
anything to eat all night.

406
00:21:35,015 --> 00:21:36,338
I was studying my words all night...

407
00:21:36,381 --> 00:21:37,681
but I missed room service hours..

408
00:21:37,712 --> 00:21:39,742
and this jar is too hard for me
to open.

409
00:21:48,252 --> 00:21:50,776
Are you opening it now, or have
you taken it?

410
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:53,590
Great.

411
00:21:53,648 --> 00:21:54,948
Thanks.

412
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:57,814
I was also wondering if you wanted
to be my friend?

413
00:21:58,086 --> 00:21:59,658
Why would I want to be friends
with a 9 year old?

414
00:22:00,023 --> 00:22:02,438
Ten but... ok it's cool.

415
00:22:03,211 --> 00:22:06,052
I just thought it would be fun to study
together before tomorrow.

416
00:22:06,398 --> 00:22:08,358
Drink soda pop from the mini-bar
and stuff.

417
00:22:09,648 --> 00:22:11,648
- You have a mini-bar in there?
- I do.

418
00:22:13,398 --> 00:22:14,698
What about mom and dad?

419
00:22:14,735 --> 00:22:17,365
My dad believes I should learn how
to be my own man.

420
00:22:17,484 --> 00:22:18,492
And that means...

421
00:22:18,576 --> 00:22:20,840
staying in my own hotel room
myself this weekend.

422
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:24,063
So you're just staying in a different
room down here, is it?

423
00:22:25,538 --> 00:22:28,032
He's staying at a fancier hotel a
few blocks away.

424
00:22:28,726 --> 00:22:30,358
Nice guy.

425
00:22:30,476 --> 00:22:31,582
It's kinda neat...

426
00:22:31,628 --> 00:22:33,378
I get to jump on the bed as much
as I want.

427
00:22:33,714 --> 00:22:36,666
But tonight, I messed up and missed
room service.

428
00:22:37,984 --> 00:22:39,484
Have you named your binder?

429
00:22:39,537 --> 00:22:41,542
Yes. Todd.

430
00:22:41,714 --> 00:22:44,289
It has all the words I've ever
memorized in them.

431
00:22:44,391 --> 00:22:46,008
And their origins.

432
00:22:46,677 --> 00:22:48,797
Todd's my key to success.

433
00:22:48,891 --> 00:22:51,957
I think I've spent more hours with
Todd than even my parents.

434
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:55,445
He's cool and he's smart and that's
why I named him, Todd.

435
00:22:56,062 --> 00:22:57,764
No, that makes sense.

436
00:22:59,783 --> 00:23:01,674
Have you figured out your favorite word?

437
00:23:01,819 --> 00:23:03,319
No I sure haven't.

438
00:23:04,226 --> 00:23:05,825
Is it the "F" word?

439
00:23:06,719 --> 00:23:08,119
It's up there.

440
00:23:08,125 --> 00:23:09,425
Cause you say it a lot.

441
00:23:09,477 --> 00:23:10,977
Everyone should.

442
00:23:11,112 --> 00:23:13,906
Not me. My father says bad words.

443
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:15,953
What about your dad?

444
00:23:15,996 --> 00:23:18,688
Never met him. But my mom said bad
words, a lot.

445
00:23:18,906 --> 00:23:21,039
But you can say bad words. Who
gives a shit.

446
00:23:21,336 --> 00:23:22,836
- I shouldn't.
- Why not?

447
00:23:22,875 --> 00:23:25,531
You just say what you feel, you know.
That's a good effort. Why don't you try one.

448
00:23:25,999 --> 00:23:28,333
I feel the opposite of bad wordy
right now.

449
00:23:29,383 --> 00:23:31,805
Will you just say something bad
you fucking Quaker.

450
00:23:34,648 --> 00:23:36,413
- Mother fucker!?
- Great!

451
00:23:36,477 --> 00:23:38,031
Perfect. That's a good one.

452
00:23:38,476 --> 00:23:40,641
And did your soul burst into
flames? No.

453
00:23:40,969 --> 00:23:42,069
Nope.

454
00:23:42,132 --> 00:23:43,632
I'm okay.

455
00:23:44,213 --> 00:23:46,612
You're a little weirdo, you know that?

456
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:07,320
Hey. Hey.

457
00:24:08,788 --> 00:24:09,888
It's morning.

458
00:24:09,913 --> 00:24:12,703
You passed out last night and I was
scared to wake you.

459
00:24:12,941 --> 00:24:15,117
My dad will be here any minute. You
should go.

460
00:24:15,164 --> 00:24:16,664
Okay.

461
00:24:22,035 --> 00:24:24,144
You sleep good, dick head?

462
00:24:28,405 --> 00:24:30,921
<i>[Jenny] So what do you want to know about
this morning?</i>

463
00:24:31,062 --> 00:24:33,035
Nothing, unless it's really important.

464
00:24:33,078 --> 00:24:35,906
You're going to be seated next to
Braden Aftergood.

465
00:24:35,973 --> 00:24:37,473
He comes from bee royalty.

466
00:24:37,538 --> 00:24:39,843
- Consider me warned.
- Good because he is awesome.

467
00:24:40,701 --> 00:24:41,534
- Is he?
- Yeah.

468
00:24:41,577 --> 00:24:42,810
Is he a great speller?

469
00:24:42,853 --> 00:24:45,149
Did I leave my underpants in your
room last night?

470
00:24:45,429 --> 00:24:48,906
Oh as a matter of fact. You... I don't know.

471
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:50,933
Would you look for me, please?

472
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:53,289
- I only brought three pairs.
- I probably would have seen them, Jenny.

473
00:24:53,374 --> 00:24:55,675
My room has no sink, shower or toilet.

474
00:24:56,258 --> 00:24:58,135
Score one for Deagan.

475
00:24:58,219 --> 00:25:00,672
And you can put me on the board too.

476
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:08,865
<i>[Guy narrating] Obviously if I could
figure out a way to be less stubborn...</i>

477
00:25:08,953 --> 00:25:11,490
<i>the right way to fix things would be
easier to see.</i>

478
00:25:11,568 --> 00:25:13,493
Window! Window! Right there!

479
00:26:09,131 --> 00:26:10,431
Pretty impressive.

480
00:26:10,437 --> 00:26:13,545
<i>[Announcer in background] All right
everybody... we've got 5 minutes.</i>

481
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:16,006
<i>[Usher] Press. Pick and Scroll.</i>

482
00:26:16,343 --> 00:26:17,543
<i>[Bernice]Yeah, I understand all that.</i>

483
00:26:17,625 --> 00:26:20,068
Here's the randomized list for
this round.

484
00:26:20,164 --> 00:26:23,555
Do me a favor and enunciate this year.

485
00:26:25,453 --> 00:26:26,753
Well...

486
00:26:26,789 --> 00:26:28,365
look who's here.

487
00:26:28,610 --> 00:26:30,219
Hook around your chair or
something?

488
00:26:31,001 --> 00:26:32,040
Good luck.

489
00:26:32,101 --> 00:26:35,157
- [Usher] Hold on.
- [Guy] I'm a contestant.

490
00:26:36,789 --> 00:26:38,289
How you doing?

491
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:44,372
Guy.

492
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:46,269
Oh, look who's here. Hi.

493
00:26:49,914 --> 00:26:51,688
Where's me? Is this me?

494
00:26:52,335 --> 00:26:53,835
Excuse me.

495
00:27:07,957 --> 00:27:12,634
Welcome everyone to the 111th annual
Golden Quill national spelling bee.

496
00:27:12,703 --> 00:27:16,953
I'm Pete Fowler coming to you live from
historic Figeroa Auditorium...

497
00:27:17,219 --> 00:27:19,573
here in sunny Los Angeles, California.

498
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:22,581
This year marks the first year that
the Golden Quill..

499
00:27:22,643 --> 00:27:24,043
has been nationally televised...

500
00:27:24,044 --> 00:27:27,403
and we can think of no better captain
for such a maiden voyage...

501
00:27:27,481 --> 00:27:30,509
then the president of the
Quill Institute itself...

502
00:27:30,595 --> 00:27:33,102
welcome to your tournament,
Professor William Bowman...

503
00:27:33,196 --> 00:27:35,648
or should I say, Dr. Bowman.

504
00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:38,023
That all depends on whether your
sick or confused.

505
00:27:38,351 --> 00:27:40,132
Otherwise, just Bill.

506
00:27:40,413 --> 00:27:42,614
Well, let's get started shall we?

507
00:27:42,733 --> 00:27:46,233
We have all 50 competitors in the room
and we're ready to begin.

508
00:27:46,306 --> 00:27:48,951
Our first competitor is Ling Quan.

509
00:27:49,068 --> 00:27:52,892
Ling says that when she grows up she'd like
to be president of the United States...

510
00:27:52,991 --> 00:27:55,508
making it your 4th to reach the office,
would it not?

511
00:27:55,586 --> 00:27:57,983
It would. Best of luck, Ling.

512
00:27:59,687 --> 00:28:01,187
Dactylogram.

513
00:28:01,668 --> 00:28:03,375
Dactylogram?

514
00:28:03,802 --> 00:28:05,359
Dactylogram.

515
00:28:05,789 --> 00:28:07,289
Dactylogram?!

516
00:28:09,445 --> 00:28:10,945
Dactylogram!

517
00:28:12,218 --> 00:28:14,098
Can I have the definition, please.

518
00:28:16,148 --> 00:28:17,759
A fingerprint.

519
00:28:19,359 --> 00:28:20,923
Dactylogram.

520
00:28:21,859 --> 00:28:23,651
May I have the origin, please.

521
00:28:24,066 --> 00:28:27,289
 From the Greek combination "Dactylo".

522
00:28:27,531 --> 00:28:29,031
I'm Guy.

523
00:28:29,078 --> 00:28:31,470
And your Braden, right,
Braden Aftergood?

524
00:28:33,366 --> 00:28:35,123
- I'm not supposed to talk to you.
<i>- [Ling in background] Dactylogram.</i>

525
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:37,730
Why not?

526
00:28:37,785 --> 00:28:41,440
Because my dad says you're probably
just an unemployed bum...

527
00:28:41,688 --> 00:28:44,086
trying to steal the prize money that
I deserve.

528
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:45,908
And that you're a cheater.

529
00:28:46,234 --> 00:28:47,768
<i>[Ling in background] Dactylogram.</i>

530
00:28:48,984 --> 00:28:50,484
He said that, huh?

531
00:28:51,547 --> 00:28:53,047
He did.

532
00:28:53,319 --> 00:28:55,100
<i>[Proctor] It is a noun.</i>

533
00:28:58,545 --> 00:28:59,845
<i>[Ling] Dactylogram</i>

534
00:28:59,906 --> 00:29:02,586
Can you tell your dad that I don't
blame him for being angry.

535
00:29:02,845 --> 00:29:04,719
And then can you do me another favor?

536
00:29:04,765 --> 00:29:06,635
Can you give these to your mother?

537
00:29:06,823 --> 00:29:08,973
She left those in my room last night.

538
00:29:09,156 --> 00:29:13,488
I would do it myself, but your 
dad ?? his mood...

539
00:29:13,538 --> 00:29:14,620
I don't want to kick the nest.

540
00:29:14,733 --> 00:29:16,617
Do you know what I mean?

541
00:29:17,303 --> 00:29:20,318
Oh buddy, good luck with that
divorce, they get so nasty.

542
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:22,193
What are you talking about?

543
00:29:22,266 --> 00:29:25,008
I'm talking about probably a very
dysfunctional marriage.

544
00:29:25,431 --> 00:29:26,931
I'm glad I was there for her.

545
00:29:27,139 --> 00:29:28,969
It's just animal instinct too you know.

546
00:29:29,133 --> 00:29:30,633
<i>[Ling in background] D-A-</i>

547
00:29:30,656 --> 00:29:33,437
She can't help it, she's just
human, okay.

548
00:29:33,547 --> 00:29:35,672
And she was very sweet. I want you
to know that.

549
00:29:35,844 --> 00:29:37,790
<i>[Ling spelling in background]</i>

550
00:29:37,965 --> 00:29:41,078
She held me afterward. Nice woman.

551
00:29:41,125 --> 00:29:43,280
- [Proctor] That is correct.
- Hey!

552
00:29:45,583 --> 00:29:46,783
You're up dog.

553
00:29:46,822 --> 00:29:50,734
<i>[Dr. Bowman] Brave, intelligent.
You've got my vote.</i>

554
00:29:51,337 --> 00:29:53,939
Next up we have probably one of this
years strongest competitors...

555
00:29:54,018 --> 00:29:55,025
Braden Aftergood.

556
00:29:55,117 --> 00:29:57,890
Oh that reminds me. My very first
spelling bee...

557
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:00,107
I had my lucky bottle cap in my
back pocket.

558
00:30:00,226 --> 00:30:02,631
Looks like he's got his good luck
hanky there.

559
00:30:04,294 --> 00:30:05,810
Noctivagant.

560
00:30:10,316 --> 00:30:13,118
I'm sorry, definition?

561
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,522
Going about in the night...

562
00:30:16,565 --> 00:30:18,065
night wandering.

563
00:30:23,449 --> 00:30:25,742
- Noctivagant.
- [Proctor] Noctivagant.

564
00:30:25,789 --> 00:30:27,428
Can you use it in a sentence?

565
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:31,609
The noctivagant alley cat...

566
00:30:31,929 --> 00:30:35,273
kept the entire neighborhood
up all night...

567
00:30:35,355 --> 00:30:40,057
by sitting on a fence, yowling out to
her many suitors.

568
00:30:41,650 --> 00:30:43,327
Noctivagant.

569
00:30:50,374 --> 00:30:51,983
Noctivagant.

570
00:30:52,749 --> 00:30:55,606
N-O-C

571
00:30:55,833 --> 00:30:57,944
T-I-V-I

572
00:30:58,896 --> 00:31:00,396
G-A-N-T

573
00:31:00,439 --> 00:31:01,939
Noctivagant.

574
00:31:04,635 --> 00:31:06,135
God.

575
00:31:06,148 --> 00:31:07,811
<i>- [Pete]Well we have our first elimination...</i>
- [Guy] I'll be right back.

576
00:31:07,854 --> 00:31:08,672
<i>of the tournament.</i>

577
00:31:08,715 --> 00:31:10,629
<i>[Dr. Bowman] Yes and surprisingly
early too.</i>

578
00:31:10,682 --> 00:31:14,977
<i>[Pete] Next up is Mr. Guy Trilby. He's
40 years old, lives in Columbus, Ohio..</i>

579
00:31:15,023 --> 00:31:18,133
<i>Now clearly Mr. Trilby has found a
loophole in the rules of entry...</i>

580
00:31:18,176 --> 00:31:19,676
and is exploiting it.

581
00:31:19,742 --> 00:31:22,217
Needless to say this is
beyond unfortunate.

582
00:31:22,265 --> 00:31:25,147
My staff and I are making all the
efforts necessary to...

583
00:31:25,214 --> 00:31:28,797
rectify the problem for the tournaments
in the years that follow.

584
00:31:29,116 --> 00:31:32,475
With that addressed, on with the
competition and the man himself...

585
00:31:32,586 --> 00:31:34,086
Guy Trilby.

586
00:31:34,406 --> 00:31:35,906
My turn.

587
00:31:37,007 --> 00:31:38,507
Frabjous.

588
00:31:40,117 --> 00:31:41,317
F-R-A-B

589
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:42,820
J-O-U-S

590
00:31:43,484 --> 00:31:44,984
That is correct.

591
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:53,468
<i>- [Angry crowd murmuring]
- [Bernice] Thank you. That's enough!</i>

592
00:31:53,517 --> 00:31:55,250
<i>[Bernice] Listen! Listen!</i>

593
00:31:55,297 --> 00:31:59,373
We are doing all we can to find a happy
resolution... to this situation.

594
00:31:59,498 --> 00:32:00,698
<i>[Angry parent] Aren't you embarrassed?!</i>

595
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:02,734
This is gonna go down in history
as the most...

596
00:32:02,828 --> 00:32:04,578
ridiculous spelling bee ever...

597
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:07,646
and it's gonna be on your head. He's
a grown man.

598
00:32:07,689 --> 00:32:10,522
Do you know how much money I've spent
on goddamn coaches.

599
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,836
- I'm sure it's a lot.
- A ton!

600
00:32:12,922 --> 00:32:14,122
He's a lunatic.

601
00:32:14,212 --> 00:32:15,112
Yes he is.

602
00:32:15,141 --> 00:32:19,196
So fix it or I swear on my childs
life with God as my witness...

603
00:32:19,239 --> 00:32:21,272
this will be the last year you're the
director of this bee!

604
00:32:21,315 --> 00:32:23,187
Alright. There's no need for threats.

605
00:32:23,281 --> 00:32:26,926
Now if we can all just leave my office
I can assure you...

606
00:32:26,976 --> 00:32:29,382
this matter is in very capable hands.

607
00:32:29,754 --> 00:32:33,031
Now keep in mind Mr. Trilby doesn't
have the discipline and practice...

608
00:32:33,082 --> 00:32:34,488
that all of your children have.

609
00:32:34,582 --> 00:32:37,211
He's made it through the first round.

610
00:32:37,258 --> 00:32:39,898
But Dr. Bowman and I are extremely
confidant...

611
00:32:39,941 --> 00:32:41,965
he's not going to make it much farther.

612
00:32:42,039 --> 00:32:45,594
And I also swear on your
children's lives...

613
00:32:45,703 --> 00:32:47,441
if he makes it to the final round...

614
00:32:47,514 --> 00:32:50,253
I'll step down as the director of
the bee, immediately.

615
00:32:50,437 --> 00:32:51,937
Good day!

616
00:32:59,156 --> 00:33:01,695
I'll jump in the shower as soon
as this buzz kicks in.

617
00:33:06,996 --> 00:33:08,732
Let me ask you a question.

618
00:33:09,162 --> 00:33:11,240
What's the grammatical significance...

619
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:14,337
of the sentence "why run from fire ants"?

620
00:33:18,531 --> 00:33:19,731
Is this a test?

621
00:33:19,788 --> 00:33:21,898
No. This isn't a que.. uh...

622
00:33:21,966 --> 00:33:24,094
I was wondering what the grammatical
significance of that sentence was...

623
00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:26,598
- "why run from fire ants"
- Right.

624
00:33:26,641 --> 00:33:29,211
Well, every vowels in there.

625
00:33:29,609 --> 00:33:32,195
Starting with the "u" going to the "a".

626
00:33:32,648 --> 00:33:34,048
Right, it's backwards.

627
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:35,600
I guess it's easy...

628
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:38,352
you know, for a sentence. I
mean I wish there was...

629
00:33:38,765 --> 00:33:41,374
one word that had all the vowels in it...

630
00:33:41,547 --> 00:33:43,380
but in alphabetical order.

631
00:33:44,539 --> 00:33:46,726
- "Facetious".
- Son of a bitch!

632
00:33:46,773 --> 00:33:48,173
- I got it?
- You're brilliant.

633
00:33:48,255 --> 00:33:49,972
- Give me another on.
- You're a genius.

634
00:33:50,032 --> 00:33:52,180
These questions are from the test they
give the geniuses.

635
00:33:52,223 --> 00:33:54,992
I got a hold of your school records,
Guy Trilby.

636
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:57,289
Your 8th grade counselor made a note...

637
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:59,856
on your file just before you
dropped out saying...

638
00:33:59,942 --> 00:34:02,286
that you showed signs of being a genius.

639
00:34:02,574 --> 00:34:04,203
FedEx was waiting for me when
I got here.

640
00:34:04,461 --> 00:34:05,861
I told you I was good.

641
00:34:05,913 --> 00:34:08,014
Mr. Leavenworth. What a dick he was.

642
00:34:08,469 --> 00:34:11,563
Told me I was a useless loser and
then he makes secret notes saying...

643
00:34:11,606 --> 00:34:13,447
that he thinks that I'm smart?!

644
00:34:15,047 --> 00:34:17,006
Glad I stole his bike and
shaved his cat.

645
00:34:18,032 --> 00:34:21,118
You just never had a chance to shine
in this school.

646
00:34:21,203 --> 00:34:23,822
- You just never had a chance to realize...
- Who didn't have a shitty upbringing.

647
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:26,875
My dad wasn't around. I mean it goes
on and on and on.

648
00:34:26,918 --> 00:34:28,503
Who skated through their adolescence?

649
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:30,620
- Where was your father?
- I don't know.

650
00:34:32,437 --> 00:34:35,116
You got something there. Where's
your pen?

651
00:34:35,186 --> 00:34:37,636
Or maybe he was brilliant. Maybe
your mom was.

652
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:40,327
They say that sometimes a brilliance
and photographic memory...

653
00:34:40,390 --> 00:34:41,390
which you have are inherited.

654
00:34:41,398 --> 00:34:43,797
Well it didn't come from mom. She hated
everything to do with education.

655
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,054
This one time when I was a kid...

656
00:34:45,097 --> 00:34:46,813
I tried to get into this local spelling
bee ironically enough...

657
00:34:46,859 --> 00:34:48,860
and she burnt my favorite dictionary.

658
00:34:49,156 --> 00:34:50,656
Is that why your here?

659
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:53,759
A chance to do something you weren't
able to do while she was alive?

660
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:55,870
Are we in interview mode, now,
c'mon. I mean...

661
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:58,827
we can't just have a normal conversation
without turning it into an interview.

662
00:34:58,913 --> 00:35:00,460
- I'm a reporter.
- That's a good point.

663
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:02,070
Can't you talk, too?

664
00:35:02,442 --> 00:35:04,829
You know, you have problems,
Guy Trilby.

665
00:35:04,977 --> 00:35:07,919
You're a shrink too? A shrink
on top of being a reporter?

666
00:35:07,962 --> 00:35:09,101
I don't know how you crammed it all in.

667
00:35:09,155 --> 00:35:10,665
You're the one with the problem.

668
00:35:10,732 --> 00:35:13,638
You have to be blindfolded to get off.
That's a problem.

669
00:35:13,818 --> 00:35:16,585
Oh! Well don't worry about that, Guy...

670
00:35:16,628 --> 00:35:18,460
cause that's never gonna happen again.

671
00:35:18,515 --> 00:35:20,695
- Great.
- Oh, yeah great.

672
00:35:20,765 --> 00:35:21,665
You promise?

673
00:35:21,726 --> 00:35:25,369
I wouldn't let you near my vagina
again if you paid me a million dollars.

674
00:35:25,617 --> 00:35:28,090
- [Jenny] Don't look at me!
- Yeah [mumbles]...

675
00:35:28,902 --> 00:35:31,656
Be quiet your voice eats hard-ons.

676
00:35:31,925 --> 00:35:33,025
I'm sorry.

677
00:35:33,049 --> 00:35:34,914
??

678
00:35:34,973 --> 00:35:38,957
Okay... Ooh... Okay! You are sorry.

679
00:35:39,628 --> 00:35:40,728
Now that's generous.

680
00:35:40,749 --> 00:35:42,249
- We're okay?
- Uh huh.

681
00:35:42,621 --> 00:35:46,303
Hang on. This might be easier? Hold on,
hold on, hold on...

682
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:48,643
- Now hold still.
- That's easier, right?

683
00:35:49,201 --> 00:35:50,701
Don't look at me. I get it.

684
00:35:51,304 --> 00:35:53,318
I get it. Don't look at me!

685
00:35:56,895 --> 00:35:58,395
Hey did you get locked out?

686
00:35:58,896 --> 00:36:01,681
I was wondering if you wanted to grab
some alimentation [food]...

687
00:36:01,737 --> 00:36:04,017
for you hyperphagia [hunger].
I'm hungry.

688
00:36:04,072 --> 00:36:06,117
Well I just got pretty hungry myself.

689
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:08,203
Sure, let's go for it.

690
00:36:08,437 --> 00:36:10,895
I can't believe you can't find any other
pre-masturbators to hang out with.

691
00:36:10,949 --> 00:36:12,249
The place is crawling with them.

692
00:36:12,303 --> 00:36:14,937
You know, you can actually study for
this spelling bee anywhere.

693
00:36:15,117 --> 00:36:17,409
Thank you. Is that right?

694
00:36:18,469 --> 00:36:21,289
Try spelling "Rigatoni" without looking.

695
00:36:21,421 --> 00:36:24,249
I don't want to. I don't need to study.
You need to study.

696
00:36:24,584 --> 00:36:26,882
Because I'm gonna slaughter you like
the sacred cow.

697
00:36:27,297 --> 00:36:28,922
Not everything is about winning.

698
00:36:29,007 --> 00:36:30,992
Closure's pretty nice too.

699
00:36:31,997 --> 00:36:34,060
To me it's about fun.

700
00:36:34,508 --> 00:36:37,010
Well, you probably deserve a little
bit better than that.

701
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,580
Excuse me, uh...

702
00:36:38,605 --> 00:36:41,180
I'm the mother of one of the
competitors competing here.

703
00:36:41,507 --> 00:36:42,407
Okay.

704
00:36:42,429 --> 00:36:45,867
What you're doing is an insult to
every honest child...

705
00:36:45,910 --> 00:36:48,344
that's worked so hard to be here.

706
00:36:49,124 --> 00:36:50,624
Including my son.

707
00:36:51,781 --> 00:36:54,796
I've worked very hard to get here too
madam and I'm well within the rules.

708
00:36:55,663 --> 00:36:57,891
You're an asshole. That's all.

709
00:36:58,547 --> 00:37:00,242
- That's a child.
- It is.

710
00:37:00,533 --> 00:37:02,682
And I'm sure he's heard even worse
from you.

711
00:37:02,781 --> 00:37:04,281
I don't speak like that in
front of him.

712
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:06,873
- Oh is that right.
- Yes that's right!

713
00:37:07,486 --> 00:37:09,446
So why don't you take your potty mouth...

714
00:37:09,626 --> 00:37:12,438
go locate your pre-teen cocksucker son...

715
00:37:12,484 --> 00:37:13,984
and stuff him back up that old...

716
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:15,921
blown out sweat sock of a vagina
and scoot off to...

717
00:37:15,984 --> 00:37:18,809
whatever shit kicking town you came
from. Can you do that for me?

718
00:37:20,985 --> 00:37:22,923
Like an elephants trunk I'll bet.

719
00:37:24,914 --> 00:37:27,232
Gray and distended.

720
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:29,880
- Good night.
- Good day.

721
00:37:29,892 --> 00:37:31,392
Thank you.

722
00:37:33,469 --> 00:37:34,869
Mothers!

723
00:37:34,967 --> 00:37:37,628
Let's get out of this restaurant. It's
a little depressing don't you think?

724
00:37:37,894 --> 00:37:40,087
My dad doesn't ever allow me to
leave the hotel.

725
00:37:40,130 --> 00:37:42,902
Well daddies not here and he sounds
like he could be an asshole so...

726
00:37:42,964 --> 00:37:45,742
so let's not listen to him. Let's go
find you some real fun.

727
00:37:46,242 --> 00:37:47,742
Side door.

728
00:39:56,106 --> 00:39:59,077
<i>[Jeremy] Glad I was in town to
catch your call.</i>

729
00:39:59,132 --> 00:40:02,113
You look really, really good.

730
00:40:02,156 --> 00:40:05,409
I appreciate that. I've been staying
away from sugar.

731
00:40:05,452 --> 00:40:07,067
- Cold turkey.
- Wow.

732
00:40:07,674 --> 00:40:09,695
Do you feel as good as you look?

733
00:40:10,462 --> 00:40:11,762
Are you happy?

734
00:40:11,794 --> 00:40:13,792
How's federal agent life treating you?

735
00:40:13,835 --> 00:40:16,531
You know it's not as fun as
it used to be. Yeah.

736
00:40:16,578 --> 00:40:20,313
I kind of miss you dinging
around where you shouldn't be.

737
00:40:22,125 --> 00:40:25,234
- Yes. Yeah.
- There you go.

738
00:40:25,848 --> 00:40:28,609
That's one background check on
one Guy Trilby.

739
00:40:32,296 --> 00:40:34,265
Is this for a story or something?

740
00:40:37,199 --> 00:40:38,699
Something good?

741
00:40:42,414 --> 00:40:44,145
Did you do this background yourself?

742
00:40:44,266 --> 00:40:46,877
Of course I did. What kind of guy
repays a favor by delegating.

743
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:48,440
I did it.

744
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:54,111
- This is incredible. Thank you, so much.
- Yeah.

745
00:40:54,908 --> 00:40:57,148
So, is that it?

746
00:40:57,733 --> 00:41:00,736
Oh yeah, this is... huge.

747
00:41:00,779 --> 00:41:03,876
That's a relief. This has been hanging
over my head for years and...

748
00:41:03,919 --> 00:41:06,055
I'm the kind of guy, I like to keep
a debt free lifestyle.

749
00:41:06,141 --> 00:41:08,281
- Oh well consider yourself...
- Yeah.

750
00:41:08,344 --> 00:41:09,152
free and clear.

751
00:41:09,223 --> 00:41:11,391
I just expected to have to do so
much more you know?

752
00:41:11,492 --> 00:41:13,308
It seems like it's not enough...

753
00:41:13,362 --> 00:41:13,875
No!

754
00:41:13,922 --> 00:41:15,905
Cause I mean, you saved my ass
you know.

755
00:41:16,053 --> 00:41:17,253
- My career.
- Wow.

756
00:41:17,258 --> 00:41:19,069
- I feel I'm getting off easy.
- No!

757
00:41:19,116 --> 00:41:22,114
You know. You did me a solid.

758
00:41:22,401 --> 00:41:25,230
No we uh, we're square.

759
00:41:25,309 --> 00:41:27,899
- You don't want anything more in return?
- Uh uh.

760
00:41:28,597 --> 00:41:30,188
You don't want anything...

761
00:41:33,346 --> 00:41:34,938
solid...

762
00:41:38,448 --> 00:41:39,948
in return.

763
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:46,250
No.

764
00:41:48,328 --> 00:41:50,907
Are you familiar with the phrase
"eatin and cheatin"

765
00:41:50,977 --> 00:41:53,455
- Thanks so much.
- It's a popular phrase.

766
00:41:55,451 --> 00:41:57,469
<i>[Guy] Aren't these guys incredible.</i>

767
00:41:58,169 --> 00:41:59,669
<i>Was I right about the cherry?</i>

768
00:41:59,768 --> 00:42:01,268
Yeah but...

769
00:42:01,468 --> 00:42:03,583
Well you might want to slow down a
little bit Swami...

770
00:42:03,859 --> 00:42:06,422
Looks like you got into the wrong
dudes ass, here.

771
00:42:06,465 --> 00:42:08,691
Hah! Funny!

772
00:42:10,772 --> 00:42:13,281
You look like you're a person who
pooped your underwear...

773
00:42:13,328 --> 00:42:15,180
then you used it for a bank
robber's mask.

774
00:42:15,227 --> 00:42:17,131
and you ??

775
00:42:17,195 --> 00:42:19,757
and forgot to wash your face.

776
00:42:20,228 --> 00:42:22,524
You shouldn't insult people. You're
no good at it.

777
00:42:24,283 --> 00:42:26,495
This soda pop is so delicious.

778
00:42:26,550 --> 00:42:28,965
I'd just say "soda" otherwise you're
gonna get raped.

779
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,531
I like having you as a friend.

780
00:42:36,739 --> 00:42:38,973
Although, I'm not your friend.

781
00:42:39,028 --> 00:42:40,941
You got friends. I'm like four times
your age.

782
00:42:41,043 --> 00:42:42,805
I really don't have any friends.

783
00:42:43,036 --> 00:42:45,430
I thought being good in spelling
would get me friends....

784
00:42:45,473 --> 00:42:47,561
but kids just make fun of me more.

785
00:42:48,851 --> 00:42:51,053
Well who needs them. You've got
Todd, right?

786
00:42:51,484 --> 00:42:53,140
And you too maybe, huh?

787
00:42:54,058 --> 00:42:56,289
No. Buddy I work alone.

788
00:42:57,010 --> 00:43:01,341
Always have. My mom always kept me
running around with her, avoiding rent.

789
00:43:01,527 --> 00:43:04,711
I never gathered a bunch of friends.

790
00:43:06,599 --> 00:43:08,978
And it's fine, it's good. You'll
be alright.

791
00:43:20,856 --> 00:43:21,901
What's that?

792
00:43:21,945 --> 00:43:24,097
I borrowed it when you borrowed
the lobster.

793
00:43:25,502 --> 00:43:27,002
Really.

794
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:29,003
Let me see it.

795
00:43:31,048 --> 00:43:33,828
Your fingers get a little sticky
when you get all boozed up.

796
00:43:36,413 --> 00:43:39,312
Toys are fun to have when you can't
play with other kids.

797
00:43:39,361 --> 00:43:40,970
That's true.

798
00:43:41,165 --> 00:43:43,992
What was your favorite toy when
you were a kid?

799
00:43:45,664 --> 00:43:48,773
Well I did love a little toy car once.

800
00:43:48,828 --> 00:43:51,817
Kind of like this. It was a shitty little
black and white police car.

801
00:43:51,860 --> 00:43:53,461
Never left my pocket.

802
00:43:54,895 --> 00:43:58,852
I lost it one night I think. I must
have dropped it or something.

803
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:01,140
I never saw it again.

804
00:44:03,055 --> 00:44:07,555
Had a little Kojak light right on top.

805
00:44:07,716 --> 00:44:09,688
Right there. A little single bubble.

806
00:44:11,422 --> 00:44:13,189
Chasing down bad guys.

807
00:44:22,492 --> 00:44:23,892
Alright so you're a little thief...

808
00:44:23,974 --> 00:44:25,789
and you don't have any friends.

809
00:44:26,532 --> 00:44:29,472
Kind of like a real loser. Bet
you crack ass though right?

810
00:44:29,519 --> 00:44:31,019
You make up for it with the women?

811
00:44:31,882 --> 00:44:33,382
No.

812
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:36,055
No girlfriend for you? You can't find
one little...

813
00:44:36,688 --> 00:44:40,708
chicken Tika that gets your shrimp
can going all up in?

814
00:44:40,976 --> 00:44:41,999
Nope.

815
00:44:42,042 --> 00:44:45,401
But when I do get one, it's going to
be a girl with nipples.

816
00:44:45,699 --> 00:44:48,531
Is that right, well lucky for you
they all have nipples, pal.

817
00:44:48,602 --> 00:44:50,460
Every girl does not have nipples.

818
00:44:50,585 --> 00:44:52,296
- They do.
- No they don't.

819
00:44:52,428 --> 00:44:54,951
 - Buddy I promise you they do.
- No they don't.

820
00:44:55,148 --> 00:44:57,916
Alright. I don't know how I missed that.

821
00:44:58,396 --> 00:44:59,896
You look at their shirts.

822
00:45:00,115 --> 00:45:02,425
On some you can see the
little nipples.

823
00:45:02,484 --> 00:45:05,322
Poking through their shirts.
On others, nothing.

824
00:45:05,453 --> 00:45:08,953
Oh I see. I got it.

825
00:45:09,299 --> 00:45:11,422
Buddy you're in bad shape.

826
00:45:11,860 --> 00:45:14,672
You know what. I'm gonna do
you a favor. C'mon.

827
00:45:15,668 --> 00:45:17,344
Let's go. You done here?

828
00:45:17,477 --> 00:45:20,203
- Where we going?
- Just c'mon. Let's go.

829
00:45:20,246 --> 00:45:23,344
My dad had been around it's something
I wish he'd have done with me.

830
00:45:25,270 --> 00:45:26,891
I hope it's not a workout.

831
00:45:27,435 --> 00:45:30,176
- I hope it's a sundae.
- Yeah, it's not.

832
00:45:30,242 --> 00:45:32,658
A desert would follow that chili dog
really well.

833
00:45:32,710 --> 00:45:34,210
No ice-cream pal.

834
00:45:41,086 --> 00:45:42,602
[Guy] Hey!

835
00:45:44,625 --> 00:45:48,125
Slum-dog I want you to meet Marzipan.
Marzipan, slum-dog.

836
00:45:48,239 --> 00:45:49,139
Hi.

837
00:45:49,201 --> 00:45:50,548
You said he was sixteen.

838
00:45:50,591 --> 00:45:53,641
Yeah he is 16. He's got a hydro-thyroid
retention problem.

839
00:45:53,705 --> 00:45:55,205
Remember Gary Coleman?

840
00:45:56,010 --> 00:45:58,064
God rest his sweet, funny soul.

841
00:45:58,107 --> 00:45:59,518
Amen, okay, let's do this.

842
00:45:59,561 --> 00:46:02,226
Chaiwalla, all I can say is
your welcome.

843
00:46:02,492 --> 00:46:03,892
For what?

844
00:46:03,938 --> 00:46:05,438
Hit it!

845
00:46:10,781 --> 00:46:20,683
3,4,5,6,7,8...

846
00:46:21,945 --> 00:46:23,792
- 9...
- Play it.

847
00:46:25,373 --> 00:46:26,873
10.

848
00:46:27,225 --> 00:46:30,505
Nice? Huh?

849
00:46:33,633 --> 00:46:35,219
Good right?

850
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:37,633
- No tip.
- No tip.

851
00:46:38,158 --> 00:46:39,258
Asshole!

852
00:46:39,318 --> 00:46:41,903
Well don't ask me for my
last 10, Marzipan...

853
00:46:41,973 --> 00:46:44,070
and then expect me to tip you. There's
your tip.

854
00:46:44,118 --> 00:46:46,790
Bye sweetie. Good luck with your
glands and shit.

855
00:46:46,846 --> 00:46:48,831
Thank you. Wasn't that good?!

856
00:46:49,598 --> 00:46:50,498
I liked her.

857
00:46:50,518 --> 00:46:52,630
I still have a couple of bucks. Do you
wanna get the ice-cream now?

858
00:46:52,673 --> 00:46:54,392
Fuck the ice-cream. I want to
touch them.

859
00:46:56,987 --> 00:46:58,875
I don't know.

860
00:46:58,914 --> 00:47:02,414
Which way did she go. She turn right?
Let's go ask her.

861
00:47:03,033 --> 00:47:04,562
Marzipan!

862
00:47:06,195 --> 00:47:07,727
[Guy] Well that might be true but...

863
00:47:07,773 --> 00:47:09,855
I still think a person your age
should be carrying...

864
00:47:09,904 --> 00:47:11,995
at least a dollar in his pocket and
if you had...

865
00:47:12,038 --> 00:47:13,038
that would have been the difference.

866
00:47:13,133 --> 00:47:14,433
You would have gotten yourself
a little bit of skin.

867
00:47:14,515 --> 00:47:16,499
But it was still the best time
of my life.

868
00:47:17,219 --> 00:47:18,930
Are we friends now?

869
00:47:23,375 --> 00:47:24,875
Cool!

870
00:47:37,874 --> 00:47:40,412
I'd like it if you could block out a
little bit of private time for me...

871
00:47:40,546 --> 00:47:42,046
after today's round.

872
00:47:42,195 --> 00:47:43,860
If you don't mind.

873
00:47:46,617 --> 00:47:48,986
You saying you want to come over and
fuck off again?

874
00:47:50,961 --> 00:47:52,061
No that's not what...

875
00:47:52,094 --> 00:47:54,251
Wanna look for your underwear?

876
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:55,290
Just give me 10 minutes.

877
00:47:55,333 --> 00:47:56,433
Guy.

878
00:47:56,437 --> 00:47:59,450
I wanted to give you something
before the round starts.

879
00:48:01,015 --> 00:48:04,515
A little white-out and a Lego piece
and you got your car back.

880
00:48:05,573 --> 00:48:07,175
Thanks buddy.

881
00:48:07,226 --> 00:48:09,727
But I'm still gonna totally
bust your nut.

882
00:48:10,758 --> 00:48:12,868
Ow. I don't think you need to say that.

883
00:48:12,936 --> 00:48:14,170
- I do.
- No, no.

884
00:48:14,234 --> 00:48:16,066
- Say you're gonna kick my ass.
- Okay.

885
00:48:16,195 --> 00:48:17,295
- That!
- Alright.

886
00:48:17,352 --> 00:48:19,024
- See you there.
- See you there.

887
00:48:21,723 --> 00:48:22,823
You're a ??.

888
00:48:22,828 --> 00:48:24,445
I don't know. Kids are weird.

889
00:48:46,539 --> 00:48:50,039
<i>Stand by in 5,4,3,2...</i>

890
00:48:50,867 --> 00:48:55,249
<i>[Pete]Welcome America to round 2 of the
Golden Quill national spelling bee.</i>

891
00:48:55,311 --> 00:48:58,206
 It is a point where, sadly, many
have already gone home.

892
00:48:58,554 --> 00:49:01,991
But the fighting spirit remains for
those who have survived.

893
00:49:02,038 --> 00:49:05,356
And that number is 30. Thirty brave
determined... [fades out]

894
00:49:07,378 --> 00:49:08,878
Here are this rounds words.

895
00:49:08,992 --> 00:49:12,964
Let's remember this competition is
in English, not marble mouth!

896
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:20,682
[Proctor] Rhapsodize.

897
00:49:22,304 --> 00:49:23,870
Rhapsodize.

898
00:49:25,734 --> 00:49:27,234
Rhapsodize.

899
00:49:30,538 --> 00:49:32,094
Rhapsodize

900
00:49:34,710 --> 00:49:36,210
Rhapsodize.

901
00:49:37,982 --> 00:49:40,074
<i>- [contest continues in background]</i>
- Joyce.

902
00:49:40,523 --> 00:49:42,381
I'm wondering if that's your...

903
00:49:42,710 --> 00:49:45,052
It's like a hair-clip or something
over there.

904
00:49:45,113 --> 00:49:47,323
- Where?
- Underneath that seat. Can you see it?

905
00:49:47,603 --> 00:49:48,703
It's certainly not mine.

906
00:49:48,781 --> 00:49:51,007
I just don't want you to lose something
that might cost... there you go.

907
00:49:51,758 --> 00:49:53,258
Give it a look.

908
00:49:53,424 --> 00:49:56,196
<i>[Guy narrating] My behavior was
ridiculous at best.</i>

909
00:49:57,835 --> 00:50:00,686
<i>I'm incredibly lucky I wasn't beaten
to death by the parents...</i>

910
00:50:01,154 --> 00:50:03,103
- There's nothing down there.
- Okay.

911
00:50:03,429 --> 00:50:04,929
<i>or their children.</i>

912
00:50:05,383 --> 00:50:06,883
That's a big never mind now.

913
00:50:07,134 --> 00:50:10,734
Okay I want you to get ready to get
super happy.

914
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,892
We've got a celebration on our hands.

915
00:50:13,001 --> 00:50:14,617
What are you talking about?

916
00:50:15,045 --> 00:50:16,859
it seems that...

917
00:50:17,616 --> 00:50:18,916
your friend...

918
00:50:18,968 --> 00:50:20,625
has finally come to town.

919
00:50:20,797 --> 00:50:21,997
- My what?
- Yeah.

920
00:50:22,069 --> 00:50:23,776
Somebody's a woman today.

921
00:50:25,961 --> 00:50:27,731
I don't know what you're saying to me.

922
00:50:30,187 --> 00:50:32,095
When you got up...

923
00:50:32,243 --> 00:50:33,813
I saw...

924
00:50:34,647 --> 00:50:36,660
your adulthood.

925
00:50:37,305 --> 00:50:38,878
Adulthood?!

926
00:50:48,332 --> 00:50:52,570
Congratulations. You must be vibrating.
That's so exciting.

927
00:50:52,777 --> 00:50:55,958
But you can celebrate later. Right now
you've got a tournament to win...

928
00:50:56,046 --> 00:50:57,146
you've got words to spell..

929
00:50:57,156 --> 00:51:00,868
even though your situation might not
be very camera friendly.

930
00:51:01,016 --> 00:51:02,216
Screw them!

931
00:51:02,266 --> 00:51:04,656
You get up there and you take this
tournament. You take what's yours.

932
00:51:05,055 --> 00:51:08,281
You have a long walk to make up there
to excellence unfortunately...

933
00:51:08,414 --> 00:51:10,525
it is all the way up there...

934
00:51:10,601 --> 00:51:13,856
<i>[Proctor] That is correct.
[Pete] Next up is Joyce Sacks.</i>

935
00:51:13,984 --> 00:51:15,184
- [Proctor] She's from...
- [Joyce] ??

936
00:51:15,218 --> 00:51:17,320
I know, I know. God so many
people watching...

937
00:51:17,391 --> 00:51:19,306
and I don't have so much as a
sweatshirt to give you...

938
00:51:19,359 --> 00:51:21,976
but I don't so instead I want you
to just keep thinking...

939
00:51:22,022 --> 00:51:23,586
these are not light pants...

940
00:51:23,633 --> 00:51:26,398
these are not light pants. You just
keep saying that to yourself.

941
00:51:26,483 --> 00:51:28,670
Competitor 1124.

942
00:51:28,718 --> 00:51:30,841
That's you. These are not light pants.

943
00:51:31,934 --> 00:51:34,118
Competitor 1124.

944
00:51:35,644 --> 00:51:37,395

just kind of....

the randomized word list was...

when I was younger.

I stirred life’s cocktail very
vigorously if you will.

I'd venture to say that more than once...

1035

even care...

so that he can't bear to beat you.

1103
01:00:56,882 --> 01:00:58,697
Dad I know the plan.

1104
01:01:00,742 --> 01:01:02,242
Hey!

1105
01:01:02,523 --> 01:01:04,023
Hey.

1106
01:01:05,335 --> 01:01:07,404
You're pretending to be my friend
just to try to win?!

1107
01:01:07,464 --> 01:01:08,764
What? No, no!

1108
01:01:08,835 --> 01:01:13,548
No, no? I just heard you and your dad
talking just outside the door there.

1109
01:01:14,117 --> 01:01:15,234
Let's all relax.

1110
01:01:15,277 --> 01:01:17,670
Eat shit buddy. I'll hit you in the
face, okay.

1111
01:01:17,749 --> 01:01:19,922
You little fuck. I can't believe I
was your goddamn mark.

1112
01:01:19,965 --> 01:01:21,169
It was my dad's idea, okay.

1113
01:01:21,212 --> 01:01:23,389
No way, it wasn't. You're a
little liar.

1114
01:01:23,445 --> 01:01:25,289
- He thought you were the biggest threat.
- Great.

1115
01:01:25,332 --> 01:01:26,832
- And you were.
- Yep.

1116
01:01:28,831 --> 01:01:30,606
Dad I really like him.

1117
01:01:30,711 --> 01:01:32,420
You make me sick, you know that.

1118
01:01:32,468 --> 01:01:35,780
I'm not doing the plan anymore. I'm
just being friends.

1119
01:01:35,851 --> 01:01:37,734
- Because we are now.
- No we're not.

1120
01:01:37,777 --> 01:01:39,177
I didn't know we would be.

1121
01:01:39,180 --> 01:01:40,827
Really? I thought winning
wasn't everything.

1122
01:01:40,902 --> 01:01:42,499
It isn't everything, not now.

1123
01:01:42,569 --> 01:01:44,532
Sure sounds like it. You're a liar.

1124
01:01:44,609 --> 01:01:47,320
Guy, you showed me my first boobs.

1125
01:01:49,742 --> 01:01:51,834
- What did he say?
- Another lie.

1126
01:01:51,999 --> 01:01:53,499
He's a lying machine.

1127
01:01:53,740 --> 01:01:55,656
Guy please!

1128
01:01:55,703 --> 01:01:56,532
Please what?

1129
01:01:56,575 --> 01:01:59,005
My dad will be so disappointed in
me if I lose.

1130
01:01:59,336 --> 01:02:00,836
I don't want that.

1131
01:02:00,929 --> 01:02:02,229
Well tough shit.

1132
01:02:02,266 --> 01:02:04,290
I guess you're just gonna have
to try and beat me now, huh.

1133
01:02:05,163 --> 01:02:06,663
And you can have this back.

1134
01:02:50,289 --> 01:02:51,189
Hello?

1135
01:02:51,223 --> 01:02:53,598

front desk...</i>

1136

driving by...</i>

1137
01:02:55,635 --> 01:02:59,135
<i>and if you can be in the lobby in one
minute, he'll take you for ice-cream.</i>

1138
01:02:59,219 --> 01:03:00,719
Really?

1139
01:04:09,272 --> 01:04:10,772
GUY!!!

1140
01:04:13,914 --> 01:04:15,515

1141
01:04:39,334 --> 01:04:40,534
<i>[On phone]Los Angeles 911.</i>

1142
01:04:40,603 --> 01:04:41,299
Hello?

1143
01:04:41,359 --> 01:04:43,775
<i>- Is this an emergency?</i>
- Yes this is an emergency.

1144
01:04:43,845 --> 01:04:45,616
<i>What is the nature of your emergency?</i>

1145
01:04:45,686 --> 01:04:48,195
Please send the police to the
Sportsmen's Lodge hotel right away.

1146
01:04:48,289 --> 01:04:49,389
What's the problem?

1147
01:04:49,398 --> 01:04:51,801
I just saw a man drag a teenager
into his room.

1148
01:04:51,844 --> 01:04:53,344
And she was screaming for help.

1149
01:04:53,460 --> 01:04:56,320
But as soon as the door shut, the
screaming suddenly stopped.

1150
01:04:57,484 --> 01:04:59,079
LAPD, open up!

1151
01:05:10,350 --> 01:05:12,779
What are you trying to do to me
you little bitch.

1152
01:05:12,822 --> 01:05:14,322
He's still got her in there.

1153
01:05:14,445 --> 01:05:15,945
Open up now!

1154
01:05:18,273 --> 01:05:19,797
Hold your tits.

1155
01:05:20,023 --> 01:05:21,640
I'm coming.

1156
01:05:21,952 --> 01:05:24,231
Shit, get in there now! Break the door.

1157
01:05:26,576 --> 01:05:28,076
<i>[Guy] Ow!</i>

1158
01:05:30,836 --> 01:05:32,336
Little bastard!

1159
01:05:32,351 --> 01:05:34,012
Well at least they didn't press charges.

1160
01:05:34,055 --> 01:05:37,106
I'll be pressing the fucking charges.
It almost broke my goddamn face.

1161
01:05:37,158 --> 01:05:38,576
Guy I've gotta talk to you about
something.

1162
01:05:38,619 --> 01:05:40,133
I don't care how much of an asshole
you are to me...

1163
01:05:40,176 --> 01:05:41,676
I'm getting it said right now.

1164
01:05:42,914 --> 01:05:45,478
I've been doing some digging... would
you stop walking for one second!

1165
01:05:45,764 --> 01:05:47,797
Jesus Christ I'm kind of all you have.

1166
01:05:48,206 --> 01:05:49,776
We can't walk and talk!

1167
01:05:51,953 --> 01:05:53,453
What's wrong?

1168
01:05:54,749 --> 01:05:56,859
I found out who your father is.

1169
01:05:58,249 --> 01:05:59,749
Oh, okay.

1170
01:06:02,648 --> 01:06:03,500
Good for you.

1171
01:06:03,546 --> 01:06:05,426
I guess you're not as bad a reporter
as I thought you were.

1172
01:06:05,475 --> 01:06:07,591
Took you a while though, don't
you think?

1173
01:06:08,078 --> 01:06:09,736
It was right there.

1174
01:06:16,712 --> 01:06:18,484
So that's what you're up to?

1175
01:06:19,531 --> 01:06:21,031
Yep.

1176
01:06:24,975 --> 01:06:28,008
Couple months ago the day my mom died
she finally told me who he was...

1177
01:06:28,301 --> 01:06:30,172
and where he was and..

1178
01:06:30,890 --> 01:06:32,390
and um...

1179
01:06:36,188 --> 01:06:38,766
Just pissed me off, obviously, so...

1180
01:06:39,857 --> 01:06:41,771
Here I am.

1181
01:06:46,789 --> 01:06:49,703
He was just a traveling encyclopedia
salesman and...

1182
01:06:49,742 --> 01:06:51,576
she was a waitress...

1183
01:06:51,678 --> 01:06:53,829
at a diner. And they...

1184
01:06:54,750 --> 01:06:58,172
She got pregnant and she told him and
he took off.

1185
01:06:59,320 --> 01:07:01,250
That's it he never returned?

1186
01:07:01,820 --> 01:07:03,320
Nope.

1187
01:07:03,414 --> 01:07:05,849
- He never called?
- Nothing.

1188
01:07:08,245 --> 01:07:09,891
So he has no idea who you are!?

1189
01:07:10,292 --> 01:07:13,438
He has no clue. But he will.

1190
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:18,938
As soon as I'm done embarrassing him and
his precious spelling bee, Bill Bowman...

1191
01:07:19,356 --> 01:07:21,934
will never forget who I am.

1192
01:07:22,664 --> 01:07:25,049
And I think that is just the bare
minimum...

1193
01:07:25,125 --> 01:07:27,756
that a son can expect from his
father, don't you?

1194
01:07:35,601 --> 01:07:38,008
Well, good digging.

1195
01:07:39,163 --> 01:07:41,133
- Did you park up here?
- Uh huh.

1196
01:07:44,906 --> 01:07:47,256
<i>[Pete] Dr. Bowman, I know that
Director Deagans resignation...</i>

1197
01:07:47,327 --> 01:07:50,193
was as difficult for you as it was
for her. Your thoughts?

1198
01:07:50,603 --> 01:07:53,001
She served this tournament well
for many years.

1199
01:07:53,919 --> 01:07:56,716
It's a tragedy that the frayed
integrity of this year's tournament...

1200
01:07:56,946 --> 01:07:59,031
has touched her post as well.

1201
01:07:59,319 --> 01:08:02,477
I hope we can finish up now without
anymore casualties.

1202
01:08:02,819 --> 01:08:04,476
Profoundly stated.

1203
01:08:04,695 --> 01:08:07,445
Now, let's begin this, the final round.

1204
01:08:07,809 --> 01:08:09,867
Ten competitors remain...

1205
01:08:11,527 --> 01:08:14,422
First up. Eric Tai from
Sorwood Wisconsin.

1206
01:08:14,602 --> 01:08:16,883
I'm gonna bust your nut.

1207
01:08:17,180 --> 01:08:19,375
I'm gonna fucking end you.

1208
01:08:24,939 --> 01:08:26,439
Inchoate.

1209
01:08:26,992 --> 01:08:28,492
Inchoate.

1210
01:08:28,991 --> 01:08:30,930

1256
01:10:40,690 --> 01:10:44,802
Because I have a beautiful, young,
fully elasticized vagina.

1257
01:10:44,850 --> 01:10:47,837
?? cock sucker

1258
01:10:47,931 --> 01:10:49,542
Don't take me, take him!

1259
01:10:49,585 --> 01:10:53,549
Well here's hoping that the guys on
the truck found the 7 second button.

1260
01:10:53,592 --> 01:10:59,035
- [Audience chanting] Take him out!

1261
01:10:59,078 --> 01:11:01,994
[Dr. Bowman] That's enough! That
is enough!

1262
01:11:04,250 --> 01:11:07,030
This is the Golden Quill spelling bee.

1263
01:11:08,765 --> 01:11:10,265
You're on television!

1264
01:11:10,554 --> 01:11:12,590
In millions of homes!

1265
01:11:14,664 --> 01:11:16,813
Show some respect for the tournament.

1266
01:11:21,859 --> 01:11:23,359
And for me!

1267
01:11:36,857 --> 01:11:39,719
I believe the word
was Slubberdegullion.

1268
01:11:39,852 --> 01:11:42,453
[Proctor] That's correct.
Slubberdegullion.

1269
01:11:45,412 --> 01:11:47,771
S-L-U-B-B-E-R

1270
01:11:47,929 --> 01:11:51,139
D-E-G-U-L-L-I-O-N

1271
01:11:52,015 --> 01:11:53,515
That is correct.

1272
01:12:02,491 --> 01:12:05,218
<i>[Guy Narrating] With the humiliation
part taken care of...</i>

1273
01:12:05,261 --> 01:12:07,968
<i>and the favorite child all but killed...</i>

1274
01:12:08,621 --> 01:12:10,961
<i>Maybe I already had my win.</i>

1275
01:12:11,264 --> 01:12:12,819
[Pete]...Eric Tai.

1276
01:12:19,077 --> 01:12:21,812
- [Proctor] Kophobia.
- Kophobia.

1277
01:12:22,616 --> 01:12:24,258
Can I have the definition, please.

1278
01:12:24,555 --> 01:12:26,071
Fear of exhaustion...

1279
01:12:26,226 --> 01:12:28,925
otherwise known as
"Lexicographer's Curse".

1280
01:12:30,461 --> 01:12:33,550
Is it derived from the Greek "kopo "
meaning fatigue?

1281
01:12:33,698 --> 01:12:35,339
[Proctor] Yes.

1282
01:12:36,825 --> 01:12:40,859
K-O-P-O-P-O-B-I-A

1283
01:12:41,430 --> 01:12:42,930
[Eric] No!

1284
01:12:44,131 --> 01:12:47,023
Oh my. Eric knew that he left
out the "H".

1285
01:12:47,124 --> 01:12:50,281
It's been a long day and clearly it's
taken it's toll on Eric.

1286
01:12:51,236 --> 01:12:54,673
Well, well. I think you're
gonna like this!

1287
01:12:55,407 --> 01:12:59,186
We're on the verge of history here
with 40 year old Guy Trilby...

1288
01:12:59,257 --> 01:13:00,811
in the final two.

1289
01:13:02,163 --> 01:13:03,783
[Proctor] Parisology.

1290
01:13:04,811 --> 01:13:06,599
Parisology.

1291
01:13:13,664 --> 01:13:16,789
P-A-R-I

1292
01:13:16,828 --> 01:13:20,328

1294
01:13:27,788 --> 01:13:29,288
I-E

1295
01:13:33,172 --> 01:13:36,012
<i>[Pete] Goodness me. What a
dramatic turn of events here.</i>

1296
01:13:36,086 --> 01:13:38,215
[Dr. Bowman] Yes. Yes indeed!

1297
01:13:40,430 --> 01:13:42,624
Ladies and gentlemen. Thank you. Quiet!

1298
01:13:42,703 --> 01:13:46,299
The rules dictate, thank you,
quiet please...

1299
01:13:46,463 --> 01:13:49,831
The rules dictate that because he's
one of the final two...

1300
01:13:49,878 --> 01:13:54,838
he remains on stage until his opponent
correctly spells the next word.

1301
01:13:57,070 --> 01:14:00,313
I'm finished here. You take it, it's
all yours.

1302
01:14:00,375 --> 01:14:02,582
<i>[Proctor] Contestant 157.</i>

1303
01:14:12,337 --> 01:14:19,594
Mr. Chopra, you are one word away from
being the new Golden Quill champion.

1304
01:14:21,609 --> 01:14:23,914
Infinitesimally.

1305
01:14:24,773 --> 01:14:26,713
Infinitesimally.

1306
01:14:27,304 --> 01:14:28,993
Can I have the definition?

1307
01:14:29,204 --> 01:14:32,610
Yes. Exceedingly small.

1308
01:14:33,444 --> 01:14:35,158
Infinitesimally.

1309
01:14:35,914 --> 01:14:43,133
I-N-F-I-N-I-T-E-S-I-M-A-L...

Y

1311
01:14:54,195 --> 01:14:56,789
Oh no. Hey!

1312
01:14:56,906 --> 01:14:59,341
<i>- [Pete] Oh my.</i>
- I can't believe it.

1313
01:14:59,726 --> 01:15:00,846
[Dr. Bowman] Not again.

1314
01:15:00,963 --> 01:15:02,416
- [Dr. Bowman] I don't believe it.

1315
01:15:04,747 --> 01:15:06,406
What are you doing?

1316
01:15:06,477 --> 01:15:08,000
If you think everything I said was
a lie...

1317
01:15:08,047 --> 01:15:09,351
then I'll prove that it wasn't.

1318
01:15:09,394 --> 01:15:11,024
- It's not about winning here...
- No, no, no, no.

1319
01:15:11,080 --> 01:15:12,798
- I don't give a shit about that.
- It's about my friend.

1320
01:15:12,841 --> 01:15:15,003
And I don't care about that either,
with all due respect...

1321
01:15:15,046 --> 01:15:16,246
very nice of you, very sweet...

1322
01:15:16,288 --> 01:15:18,423
but I'm not here for that and I'm not
here for the fucking trophy or a check.

1323
01:15:18,466 --> 01:15:19,891
- or these idiots, c'mon.
- I hurt your feelings...

1324
01:15:19,934 --> 01:15:22,637
- And I wasn't a good friend, I'm sorry.
- You know what, pal we're good.

1325
01:15:24,985 --> 01:15:26,930
Okay, next.

1326
01:15:27,944 --> 01:15:29,508
Rugose.

1327
01:15:30,336 --> 01:15:31,736
R-U-G-O-S

1328
01:15:31,789 --> 01:15:34,269
Ding it. I'm finished! Let's go.

1329
01:15:34,312 --> 01:15:36,315
You're wasting my fucking time, c'mon.

1330
01:15:38,544 --> 01:15:40,169
[Proctor] Pejorative.

1331
01:15:40,617 --> 01:15:45,818
P-E-J-O-R-A-T-E-V-E
Pejorative.

1332
01:15:46,578 --> 01:15:49,481
<i>[Pete] Seems as though they're
misspelling the words on purpose.</i>

1333
01:15:49,531 --> 01:15:50,831
Can you just spell the fucking words!

1334
01:15:50,861 --> 01:15:52,559
That's all you gotta do and you
got the tournament.

1335
01:15:52,602 --> 01:15:53,702
Same with you.

1336
01:15:53,708 --> 01:15:55,688
Chailanta get your shit together
you dumb dick!

1337
01:15:56,590 --> 01:15:58,887
Fuck you, Guy!

1338
01:16:00,045 --> 01:16:01,858
Nice, great.

1339
01:16:03,216 --> 01:16:04,863
Dad you got a real prince here.

1340
01:16:04,914 --> 01:16:08,750
Yeah he's a liar and he's swearing.
That's a good combo. Sweet.

1341
01:16:09,477 --> 01:16:10,577
One more word please.

1342
01:16:10,610 --> 01:16:14,466
I did...not...lie! Got it?!

1343
01:16:14,638 --> 01:16:17,678
I say that you did, got it!

1344
01:16:23,904 --> 01:16:27,383
<i>[Pete] Okay. This has
turned ugly.</i>

1345
01:16:28,976 --> 01:16:30,737
You can add "violent" to the list.

1346
01:16:30,796 --> 01:16:32,843
Your boy Gandhi would be real proud.

1347
01:16:34,101 --> 01:16:36,657
And by the way, I was born...

1348
01:16:36,751 --> 01:16:38,431
in Cleveland...

1349
01:16:38,491 --> 01:16:40,227
Ohio!

<i>[TV Spot] ...your voice, we share
your mind.</i>

with extraordinary...</i>

1352

<i>[Pete] I really don't know what
to say, America.</i>

1355
01:17:05,114 --> 01:17:06,804
Dr. Bowman is conferring with
the judges...

1356
01:17:07,729 --> 01:17:09,520
...addressing the audience.

1357
01:17:14,686 --> 01:17:16,263
[Dr. Bowman] Ladies and gentlemen...

1358
01:17:17,453 --> 01:17:19,461
boys and girls...

1359
01:17:19,805 --> 01:17:22,285
those of you at home, and
in attendance.

1360
01:17:22,328 --> 01:17:25,414
I would like to extend my
deepest apologies for...

1361
01:17:25,546 --> 01:17:29,617
what has devolved into
an embarrassment...

1362
01:17:29,766 --> 01:17:31,509
in this years competition.

1363
01:17:32,093 --> 01:17:34,624
The Golden Quill has always enjoyed a...

1364
01:17:34,726 --> 01:17:37,703
an immaculate reputation of respectful...

1365
01:17:37,797 --> 01:17:40,531
challenging and um, dignified behavior.

1366
01:17:41,562 --> 01:17:43,062
Until now...

1367
01:17:43,230 --> 01:17:46,668
Well hopefully the end is near.
Gentlemen!

1368
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:50,764
Gentlemen, it has been decided that
neither of you will be disqualified...

1369
01:17:51,037 --> 01:17:52,748
because it appears...

1370
01:17:53,188 --> 01:17:54,850
it appears that both of you...

1371
01:17:54,975 --> 01:17:57,050
have conducted yourselves equally...

1372
01:17:57,210 --> 01:17:58,802
in a shameful manner.

1373
01:17:59,107 --> 01:18:02,180
So let's get on with this contest
and finish it.

1374
01:18:02,219 --> 01:18:05,195
I'm gonna ask the audience, please
remain silent.

1375
01:18:05,601 --> 01:18:07,101
Thank you.

1376
01:18:09,515 --> 01:18:12,119
- And continuing...
- Yep, my turn.

1377
01:18:13,999 --> 01:18:15,299
Unguent.

1378
01:18:15,327 --> 01:18:17,768
Unguent?
A-N-G-U-E-N-T

1379
01:18:17,874 --> 01:18:19,374
Ding it!

1380
01:18:20,195 --> 01:18:22,201
I can do this all night.

1381
01:18:22,607 --> 01:18:24,107
Go ahead.

1382
01:18:28,046 --> 01:18:32,148
Please. Very carefully consider
the word...

1383
01:18:33,101 --> 01:18:34,737
Callithump.

1384
01:18:36,910 --> 01:18:41,025
- C-A-L...
- Chaitan!

1385
01:18:41,766 --> 01:18:43,766
Please don't do this to us.

1386
01:18:56,820 --> 01:18:59,414
C-A-L

1387
01:19:00,108 --> 01:19:03,525
It's the easiest word of the night.
It's C-A-L-I-T-H-U-M-P

1388
01:19:03,568 --> 01:19:05,149
It's simple idiot.

1389
01:19:05,374 --> 01:19:07,905
No you're the idiot. You forgot an "L".

1390
01:19:07,984 --> 01:19:09,284
Alright. That's it!

1391
01:19:09,328 --> 01:19:12,406
That's all! You tried to help a fellow
competitor cheat.

1392
01:19:12,846 --> 01:19:14,512
That is against the rules.

1393
01:19:14,671 --> 01:19:16,645
Sir, you are disqualified!

1394
01:19:17,125 --> 01:19:18,225
Doesn't matter.

1395
01:19:18,281 --> 01:19:20,859
I misspelled it...

1396
01:19:21,358 --> 01:19:23,757
he corrected me.

1397
01:19:25,769 --> 01:19:27,529
[Proctor] Which means...

1398
01:19:27,572 --> 01:19:30,318
even though you tried to help
him cheat...

1399
01:19:30,568 --> 01:19:32,068
he wasn't cheating...

1400
01:19:32,368 --> 01:19:37,122
and ended up, technically spelling
the word correctly on his own.

1401
01:19:38,074 --> 01:19:41,370
So, he is the new champion!

1402
01:19:44,533 --> 01:19:45,990
- [Announcer] Correct.
- [Chaitanya] No, Guy!

1403
01:19:46,033 --> 01:19:47,588
Guy, you tricked me.

1404
01:19:48,059 --> 01:19:49,059
No, Guy!

1405
01:19:49,109 --> 01:19:50,734
Chaiwalla go hug your chai-papa.

1406
01:19:50,788 --> 01:19:52,343
No that's not fair!

1407
01:19:54,086 --> 01:19:56,451
[Dr. Bowman] Here's your trophy
Chaitanya, congratulations.

1408
01:19:56,551 --> 01:19:57,451
Guy!

1409
01:19:57,515 --> 01:20:00,680
And here's your check for fifty
thousand dollars.

1410
01:20:08,094 --> 01:20:09,422
- I guess that worked, huh.
- [Announcer] Chaitanya, you are our...

1411
01:20:09,484 --> 01:20:10,984
new champion, how does that feel?

1412
01:20:11,340 --> 01:20:13,220
[Chaitanya] I don't consider myself
a champion...

1413
01:20:13,263 --> 01:20:15,510
I consider myself a
co-champion with Guy.

1414
01:20:15,632 --> 01:20:17,132
Guy!

1415
01:20:19,472 --> 01:20:22,074
It was totally unfair to disqualify you.

1416
01:20:22,626 --> 01:20:25,767
This is yours too. You let me win.

1417
01:20:28,784 --> 01:20:31,089
And I wanna give you half.

1418
01:20:31,784 --> 01:20:34,258
Plus, we'll split things.

1419
01:20:37,601 --> 01:20:39,223
Right?

1420
01:21:13,313 --> 01:21:15,752
<i>[Guy narrating] I don't know if I
should have done things differently. </i>

1421
01:21:16,176 --> 01:21:19,664
<i>Like I said, I'm not good at
a lot of things.</i>

1422
01:21:22,601 --> 01:21:24,601
<i>Maybe there should have been a
screaming match.</i>

1423
01:21:27,531 --> 01:21:29,031
<i>Or fight.</i>

1424
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:31,694
<i>Maybe some tears.</i>

1425
01:21:38,477 --> 01:21:40,789
<i>But I guess I just wanna move on.</i>

1426
01:21:43,172 --> 01:21:45,240
<i>And let you do the same.</i>

1427
01:21:53,445 --> 01:21:55,093
<i>What's done is done.</i>

1428
01:21:56,554 --> 01:21:58,193
<i>I can't change what happened.</i>

1429
01:22:01,460 --> 01:22:03,199
<i>All I can do...</i>

1430
01:22:04,694 --> 01:22:06,544
<i>all I wanna do...</i>

1431
01:22:12,382 --> 01:22:14,813
<i>Is leave you with this apology.</i>

1432
01:22:16,038 --> 01:22:17,699
<i>This note.</i>

1433
01:22:19,219 --> 01:22:22,507
<i>Which started with me telling you my
feelings were hurt.</i>

1434
01:22:27,055 --> 01:22:29,503
What the hell can you possibly write...

1435
01:22:29,632 --> 01:22:32,359
that I would be interested in reading!?

1436
01:22:35,632 --> 01:22:38,702
There was a bit in there about me
being your son.

1437
01:23:25,804 --> 01:23:28,453
[Guy narrating]And as much as I'd
like to hurt <i></i>your feelings...

1438
01:23:29,421 --> 01:23:31,223
<i>and call you names...</i>

1439
01:23:31,772 --> 01:23:33,308
<i>they're just words...</i>

1440
01:23:33,730 --> 01:23:35,230
<i>and it wouldn't change a thing.</i>

1441
01:23:37,008 --> 01:23:38,779
<i>That's not what this note was for.</i>

1442
01:23:44,539 --> 01:23:47,382
<i>Hopefully it has explained why
I did what I did.</i>

1443
01:23:48,606 --> 01:23:51,130
<i>And maybe even have you understand.</i>

1444
01:23:52,640 --> 01:23:54,812
<i>If not, that's fine.</i>

1445
01:23:59,843 --> 01:24:01,679
<i>Yours literally...</i>

1446
01:24:01,898 --> 01:24:03,398
<i>Guy Trilby.</i>

1447
01:24:19,164 --> 01:24:21,402
- Hey spelling nerd.
- Yes?

1448
01:24:21,445 --> 01:24:24,315
- Can you spell "douche bag"?
- Of course.

1449
01:24:26,843 --> 01:24:30,497
- How do you spell "pick up your books"?
- That's a sentence!

1450
01:24:39,436 --> 01:24:41,063
Hey slum-dog.

1451
01:24:43,502 --> 01:24:44,313
Wow!

1452
01:24:44,356 --> 01:24:46,071
Right! Get over here!

1453
01:24:51,859 --> 01:24:53,259
Where'd you get this?

1454
01:24:53,263 --> 01:24:55,345
I got this old police car at an auction...

1455
01:24:55,430 --> 01:24:57,720
with my half of your winnings. So
thank you very much.

1456
01:24:57,763 --> 01:25:00,885
you got me two cars in one month.
You're a nice guy.

1457
01:25:01,015 --> 01:25:02,594
Now to pay you back...

1458
01:25:03,570 --> 01:25:05,438
how about we go chase some
bad guys.

1459
01:25:05,730 --> 01:25:07,230
Love too!

1460
01:25:13,286 --> 01:25:15,059
We're coming to get you!

1461
01:25:18,726 --> 01:25:20,415
<i>[Chaitanya] Get the bad guys!</i>

1462
01:25:22,867 --> 01:25:26,367
