1
00:01:12,672 --> 00:01:13,832
Oh, God.

2
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:21,740
Well, what the hell happened?

3
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:24,307
- We're an old married couple.
- Mmm-hmm.

4
00:01:29,622 --> 00:01:31,089
Was it the pot?

5
00:01:34,127 --> 00:01:37,028
I don't think so, because we
brought it with us from New York.

6
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:38,927
- Yeah.
- It's the same.

7
00:01:41,968 --> 00:01:43,401
What was that..

8
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:49,173
What was that old movie?

9
00:01:51,711 --> 00:01:54,612
You know, Blame it on Rio.

10
00:01:57,817 --> 00:02:00,183
It has to be that,
it has to be that.

11
00:02:05,091 --> 00:02:07,059
You got to feel my heart.

12
00:02:11,364 --> 00:02:14,162
Are you going to make
it till dinnertime?

13
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:21,765
After dinnertime.

14
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:30,843
Oh, God.

15
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:37,286
God, I'd love to live like this.

16
00:02:39,792 --> 00:02:40,850
Yeah.

17
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:47,665
I'm willing, if you have enough money to
stay in Brazil for the rest of our lives.

18
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:55,002
I'll think about it.

19
00:02:58,511 --> 00:02:59,569
Okay.

20
00:03:10,156 --> 00:03:12,522
Do you think that's
it, being away?

21
00:03:16,596 --> 00:03:17,961
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

22
00:03:25,738 --> 00:03:27,035
Hey, babe.

23
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,802
Where did you go?

24
00:03:34,914 --> 00:03:36,905
Don't do this to yourself.

25
00:03:39,686 --> 00:03:41,620
Everything is wonderful.

26
00:03:43,756 --> 00:03:45,690
Everything is wonderful.

27
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,628
Mmm-hmm.

28
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:51,788
Yeah.

29
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:59,702
I don't feel like such a fuck-up
when I'm here, that's all.

30
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:43,278
- Good luck.
- See you in a bit.

31
00:04:45,852 --> 00:04:47,217
I love you.

32
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,498
Okay.

33
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:13,838
Don't touch anything. Don't
say anything. Back up.

34
00:05:13,946 --> 00:05:16,414
Turn off the lights.
Turn them off.

35
00:05:21,054 --> 00:05:23,045
Are you.. Don't even
think about the buzzer.

36
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,714
Get in the corner.

37
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:30,889
Is the cash in here? Open it up.
Open it up!

38
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:33,795
Quicker. Get over here. Get over here.
You want me to fucking shoot you?

39
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,868
Open it up. Open it up.

40
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:39,862
Get over in the corner. Get over
in the corner. Keep your hands down.

41
00:05:39,972 --> 00:05:42,133
Keep your fucking hands down.

42
00:05:43,443 --> 00:05:44,740
All right?

43
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:52,115
Come over here. Get over
here so I can see you.

44
00:05:52,218 --> 00:05:55,346
Come over here. Stand at the corner.
Come over here.

45
00:05:55,455 --> 00:05:58,151
Put your hands down.
Put your hands down.

46
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:03,827
Oh, shit! Is this all
you got in here?

47
00:06:05,231 --> 00:06:08,997
I'm watching.. Stay away from
the fucking buzzer, all right.

48
00:06:10,336 --> 00:06:12,236
Fucking shit, it's all she..
Get back in your corner.

49
00:06:12,338 --> 00:06:15,603
Get back in your fucking..
Get back in your corner!

50
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:25,076
All right, keep your hands down by
your side, all right. I'm watching you.

51
00:06:25,184 --> 00:06:29,018
I will shoot you, all right. I'll
fucking shoot you in a second.

52
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:33,149
This is all shit.

53
00:06:34,026 --> 00:06:35,254
Diamonds.

54
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:39,827
Where's the fucking
keys for this case?

55
00:06:39,932 --> 00:06:41,661
Where's the.. Where are
the keys for this case?

56
00:06:41,768 --> 00:06:44,236
- In the drawer.
- Shut up, all right.

57
00:06:45,671 --> 00:06:48,640
These are them? Don't
fucking move, all right.

58
00:06:49,008 --> 00:06:50,339
Don't move.

59
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,969
What, are they all the same?

60
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:54,507
Are they?

61
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:56,643
Fucking stupid bitch.

62
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:58,742
I'm watching you.

63
00:07:00,052 --> 00:07:03,488
Which fucking key.. Which fucking..
This is bullshit!

64
00:07:05,491 --> 00:07:07,254
What the fuck is up..

65
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:09,754
What type of glass is this..

66
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:12,555
Fuck is up with this glass?

67
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:14,330
Fuck this..

68
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:18,398
Bullshit.

69
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:20,003
Fuck this..

70
00:07:23,209 --> 00:07:24,403
Fuck, no.

71
00:07:28,181 --> 00:07:31,241
Fuck you, you motherfucking
stupid fuck.

72
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:34,410
Fuck.

73
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:09,018
My gun.

74
00:08:31,377 --> 00:08:33,004
Fuck! Andy!

75
00:08:35,781 --> 00:08:37,646
Hank, you're so stupid!

76
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,123
Fucking Andy!

77
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:50,719
Shit.

78
00:09:19,926 --> 00:09:22,952
Hey, two for four.
You're batting.500.

79
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:24,290
No, Dad, the second
one was an air..

80
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:26,456
- No, no. It was a perfectly placed bunt.
- Good game, sweetheart.

81
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:27,692
- Good game.
- How many you got?

82
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,131
Yeah, who's going
to want seconds?

83
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:31,032
Uncle Andy, can I
have another hot dog?

84
00:09:31,137 --> 00:09:33,401
Yeah, the way you played today,
I'll buy you the whole stand.

85
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:35,269
No, her mother doesn't want
her eating junk, all right?

86
00:09:35,374 --> 00:09:38,104
That's not junk, that's all right.
That's a hot dog, right, honey?

87
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:39,199
What do I owe you?

88
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:40,870
Hey, Hank, your money
is no good here.

89
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,470
No, I got it, okay.

90
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,311
- I got it.
- You sure?

91
00:09:49,989 --> 00:09:52,890
- That was a good game.
- Yeah.

92
00:09:52,992 --> 00:09:54,118
Hey, give me a kiss.
Give me a kiss.

93
00:09:54,226 --> 00:09:55,716
- All right. I'll see you next weekend?
- I love you.

94
00:09:55,828 --> 00:09:58,296
All right, be good.
Here's your ball.

95
00:09:58,397 --> 00:10:01,457
- You didn't feed her junk, did you?
- No, of course not.

96
00:10:01,567 --> 00:10:03,125
I don't want her to develop
bad eating habits.

97
00:10:03,235 --> 00:10:04,896
- She looks puffy.
- She doesn't look puffy, all right.

98
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:06,995
- You look puffy.
- Fuck you.

99
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:09,471
- She wore sun block?
- It was cloudy, Martha.

100
00:10:09,575 --> 00:10:12,271
There are rays, Hank.
Hey, you got my money?

101
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:16,337
Oh, Christ, Martha. Do you have any
idea what that school is costing me?

102
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:17,643
You're the one who wanted
to send her there.

103
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:20,344
Yeah, because it is a damn good
school and she wanted to go there.

104
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:22,785
- You owe me three months.
- I don't owe you.

105
00:10:22,888 --> 00:10:25,652
- I owe Danielle.
- Don't get semantic.

106
00:10:25,758 --> 00:10:28,022
- Bye.
- April, May and June.

107
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:39,400
No, I promise, all right.

108
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:41,497
What's up, Hank?

109
00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:43,875
Piece of shit!

110
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:50,543
Fuck you. All right. Can I
borrow your cell phone?

111
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:52,976
I don't have one.

112
00:10:53,285 --> 00:10:55,378
- Just..
- It's brain cancer. There's a pay phone

113
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:58,457
- over there by the bathroom.
- No, it can wait.

114
00:10:59,558 --> 00:11:01,549
What's happening with you?

115
00:11:02,128 --> 00:11:03,390
I used to think you had
the world by the balls.

116
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:06,090
Now, I'm not sure if
you even got any.

117
00:11:06,198 --> 00:11:08,132
I got them when I
need them, all right?

118
00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:09,292
Yeah.

119
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:12,167
Yeah, smart and funny.

120
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:15,636
What I always admired
about you, your wit.

121
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:19,678
- You're a prick, Andy.
- I always was.

122
00:11:22,748 --> 00:11:25,512
- So, let's see if there're any left.
- What?

123
00:11:27,486 --> 00:11:28,646
Cojones.

124
00:11:29,555 --> 00:11:32,023
Well, you need money. So do I.
Let's solve it.

125
00:11:32,124 --> 00:11:36,356
- What are you talking about?
- Well, there's a place we can knock off.

126
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:40,963
Know it like the back of our hand.
Easiest money you'll ever get.

127
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:48,601
What are you saying?

128
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:51,373
It's worth about 600 grand.

129
00:11:52,578 --> 00:11:55,012
And it's insured, so
it's a victimless crime.

130
00:11:55,114 --> 00:11:57,947
I offer that in case your faggoty
little conscience bothers you.

131
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:00,712
I weigh it off on 20
cents on the dollar.

132
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,583
That's 60 grand each.

133
00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:05,188
Give or take.

134
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:10,354
I can't believe this
is you that's talking.

135
00:12:10,463 --> 00:12:11,794
Believe it.

136
00:12:12,331 --> 00:12:16,961
So, it's safe, nobody gets hurt,
everybody wins. It's perfect.

137
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:19,393
Why?

138
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:23,807
What do..

139
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:26,770
- Do you need money?
- Of course, I need money. But this is..

140
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:29,848
This is serious crime, Andy. I'm not a
serious crime kind of a guy. I got a kid..

141
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:31,507
You've got shit.

142
00:12:32,284 --> 00:12:34,548
You have a whole lot of shit.
You said so yourself.

143
00:12:34,653 --> 00:12:36,587
All the time. Every day.

144
00:12:41,193 --> 00:12:44,594
You know what? It's not as
serious as you might think.

145
00:12:45,998 --> 00:12:48,694
You're my little brother.
Now, trust me.

146
00:12:53,672 --> 00:12:54,969
God, Andy.

147
00:12:57,643 --> 00:12:58,667
That's why you called me up?

148
00:12:58,778 --> 00:12:59,972
That's why you wanted to
spend the night together,

149
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,411
- talk me into something crazy?
- That's why I called you up.

150
00:13:04,683 --> 00:13:06,776
Talk you into something crazy.

151
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:11,987
Well, what's the place?

152
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:17,220
No, not another word
till you commit.

153
00:13:20,332 --> 00:13:21,390
Fuck.

154
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:23,863
It's all right.

155
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:26,832
So, how's the wife?

156
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:39,112
Hey, Hank.

157
00:13:42,588 --> 00:13:44,522
Hey, I got an appointment.

158
00:13:44,623 --> 00:13:48,923
- I'll be back in a few, all right.
- Of course, you will. It's Thursday.

159
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:04,537
- You're early.
- Well..

160
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:08,437
You know my days are so busy.

161
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:17,145
Just tell me that
you'll think about it.

162
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:20,282
But I thought about it already.
And I came to the conclusion

163
00:14:20,392 --> 00:14:22,053
that you're crazy.

164
00:14:22,761 --> 00:14:25,025
I'm going to go where with you?

165
00:14:25,831 --> 00:14:28,925
I mean, you've got
child support.

166
00:14:29,568 --> 00:14:32,332
You've got Danielle's school,
you've got the rent..

167
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:37,103
- The mortgage..
- Come on.

168
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:41,043
- ..you're up to your ears in debt, Hank.
- I can solve all that. I know I can.

169
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:45,039
When are you going
to grow up, Hank?

170
00:14:45,918 --> 00:14:48,386
We have a really
good thing going,

171
00:14:49,021 --> 00:14:50,818
and you should just enjoy it.

172
00:14:50,923 --> 00:14:54,654
We have a really good time in bed.
I don't ask for anything.

173
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:57,251
I love you. I want more.

174
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:03,393
So does Oliver Twist.

175
00:15:07,973 --> 00:15:09,998
Can I help you to seconds?

176
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:14,906
Or do you really, really,
really have to get back?

177
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:21,243
Huh?

178
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:25,818
"The weight of this sad
time we must obey."

179
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:29,053
"Speak what we feel and not
what we ought to say."

180
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:35,166
"The oldest hath borne most."

181
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:37,599
"We that are young shall
never see so much,"

182
00:15:45,811 --> 00:15:48,302
Bravo! Bravo!

183
00:15:54,386 --> 00:15:58,447
You were great. I'm
so proud of you.

184
00:15:58,557 --> 00:16:00,320
You were wonderful.

185
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:02,826
Grandpa and I thought
you were wonderful.

186
00:16:02,928 --> 00:16:06,056
Excuse me, I'm sorry. It's just..
I have to have your autograph.

187
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:07,632
- Dad. No.
- What, you were incredible.

188
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:09,166
- No, stop it.
- What?

189
00:16:09,268 --> 00:16:11,793
- I messed up some of my lines.
- No, you didn't. I didn't notice.

190
00:16:11,904 --> 00:16:13,098
- Did you notice?
- I didn't notice at all.

191
00:16:13,205 --> 00:16:15,230
Honey, you were great. What?

192
00:16:15,341 --> 00:16:17,809
Mom, can I go see The
Lion King this weekend?

193
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:21,437
- There's a class trip, everyone's going.
- Did you ask your father?

194
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,347
- Can I, Dad?
- Yeah, sure. I got some money.

195
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:26,475
Well, it's $130.

196
00:16:26,585 --> 00:16:30,681
But we're staying overnight and
that includes hotel and everything.

197
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:35,751
Okay, great. Yeah.

198
00:16:59,051 --> 00:17:01,645
- Yeah.
- Hey, man. Can I talk to you?

199
00:17:01,754 --> 00:17:04,552
- Where are you?
- I'm down the hall, by the coffee.

200
00:17:04,656 --> 00:17:07,557
- How about my office, 30 seconds?
- All right.

201
00:17:10,295 --> 00:17:13,458
Hank, the super at 111 Riverside
says the boiler's really kaput.

202
00:17:13,565 --> 00:17:16,193
He needs you to.. Hello?

203
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:36,076
So?

204
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:43,026
- That place that you were talking about.
- What place?

205
00:17:43,128 --> 00:17:45,858
- The one that we were going to..
- To knock off?

206
00:17:45,964 --> 00:17:47,022
Yeah.

207
00:17:47,332 --> 00:17:48,492
To rob?

208
00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:50,532
You say it.

209
00:17:51,603 --> 00:17:53,161
Tell me about it.

210
00:17:53,338 --> 00:17:54,999
I'm not going to tell you about
it until you say you're in

211
00:17:55,107 --> 00:17:57,803
and once you say it,
there's no way out.

212
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:05,876
I'm in.

213
00:18:08,954 --> 00:18:10,785
Let me see your hands.

214
00:18:12,991 --> 00:18:15,619
- Just say it again,
- What're you talking about?

215
00:18:15,727 --> 00:18:17,319
Just say it again,

216
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:18,589
I'm in.

217
00:18:22,968 --> 00:18:24,060
What?

218
00:18:24,403 --> 00:18:26,803
I just wanted to see if you were pulling
any of that chickenshit baby stuff

219
00:18:26,905 --> 00:18:27,894
like when we were
kids, you know,

220
00:18:28,006 --> 00:18:29,530
"It doesn't count. I had
my fingers crossed."

221
00:18:29,641 --> 00:18:32,007
I'm in. What're we doing?

222
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:34,944
- And when?
- It's a jewelry store.

223
00:18:35,747 --> 00:18:37,510
- Does this ring a bell?
- No.

224
00:18:38,217 --> 00:18:40,185
What if I tell you it's got

225
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:44,312
a Foot Locker on one side and a
Claire's Accessories on the other.

226
00:18:49,728 --> 00:18:52,697
Yeah, that's right. You got it.
Now, listen.

227
00:18:54,399 --> 00:18:57,926
We don't want Tiffany's. We
want a Mom and Pop operation,

228
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:00,262
in a busy place,

229
00:19:00,606 --> 00:19:03,871
on a Saturday when the
week's takes go in the safe.

230
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:06,342
We both worked there. We
know the safe combinations.

231
00:19:06,445 --> 00:19:09,812
We know the burglar alarm signals.
We know where everything is.

232
00:19:09,915 --> 00:19:13,248
I figure, between
the week's take,

233
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:16,913
the jewelry and the cases, the
vault, there's a $500,000 haul.

234
00:19:17,022 --> 00:19:18,887
I figure probably six.

235
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:21,551
That old dumb old lady that works
there, she's alone till noon.

236
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,924
She's not going to be a problem.

237
00:19:27,032 --> 00:19:28,056
Andy.

238
00:19:28,867 --> 00:19:29,925
Yeah?

239
00:19:31,203 --> 00:19:33,262
That's Mom and Dad's store.

240
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:37,335
That's what I said.

241
00:19:37,776 --> 00:19:39,710
A Mom and Pop operation.

242
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:44,714
- You can't do that.
- Yeah, we can. Think about it.

243
00:19:44,816 --> 00:19:46,613
It's perfect. It's perfect.

244
00:19:46,718 --> 00:19:48,413
In and out in a minute.

245
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,353
Insurance takes care of Mom and
Dad, so they're not hurt. Right?

246
00:19:51,456 --> 00:19:53,924
No one's going to give a shit.
After a week the cops

247
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:58,053
- will put it in the back of the filing cabinet.
- Jesus, Andy. I..

248
00:19:58,263 --> 00:20:00,754
Why did you even
want me in on this?

249
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:05,028
Well, it'll solve
everything for both of us.

250
00:20:05,237 --> 00:20:07,432
What has to be solved for you?

251
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:10,535
Same as you. I need money. I'm
going to start over again.

252
00:20:10,642 --> 00:20:12,576
What do you mean?

253
00:20:12,678 --> 00:20:14,737
What the fuck kind of..
It's none of your business.

254
00:20:14,846 --> 00:20:17,440
I just want out. I just want to..
That's all.

255
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:20,712
I'm getting out, I want to
help my little brother.

256
00:20:21,853 --> 00:20:23,013
Come on.

257
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:25,948
Yeah.

258
00:20:26,658 --> 00:20:28,853
No, I don't think I can do this.
I don't think I can..

259
00:20:28,961 --> 00:20:32,397
Yeah, you can. Yeah, you can.

260
00:20:33,031 --> 00:20:34,259
I just..

261
00:20:40,005 --> 00:20:41,438
That's $2,000.

262
00:20:46,945 --> 00:20:48,469
It's an advance.

263
00:20:49,648 --> 00:20:51,946
See what just that
much does for you.

264
00:20:53,051 --> 00:20:54,040
And,

265
00:20:55,854 --> 00:20:57,446
imagine the rest.

266
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:13,299
Five, six, seven, eight,
nine hundred dollars.

267
00:21:14,473 --> 00:21:15,565
You still owe me May and June.

268
00:21:15,674 --> 00:21:18,404
Yeah, Monday. All right.
Everything on Monday.

269
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:19,772
- That's what I said.
- Such a loser.

270
00:21:19,878 --> 00:21:21,368
You're such a fucking loser.

271
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,606
I come over here with $900.

272
00:21:22,714 --> 00:21:25,342
- Yeah, well, if it was for me, maybe.
- And I'm the fucking.. All right.

273
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:26,917
- May and June, asshole.
- Bye, bye, bye.

274
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:28,008
Danielle, dinner.

275
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:32,048
No, please don't put me on..
Jesus.

276
00:21:32,157 --> 00:21:33,556
- Yo, Bobby.
- What's going on?

277
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:35,627
- Hey, here, let me buy you a drink.
- I'm working.

278
00:21:35,727 --> 00:21:39,128
- I ain't loaning you no more money.
- No, come on, man. I'm flush.

279
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:40,858
- You don't exactly..
- Yeah, something like that.

280
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:42,490
Look, you just.. If you're
free tomorrow morning,

281
00:21:42,601 --> 00:21:44,694
I got a proposition for you.

282
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:46,764
- Later.
- All right.

283
00:21:51,576 --> 00:21:53,703
- What if there is a security guard?
- There isn't.

284
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:57,475
- Why?
- No, it's a Mom and Pop place.

285
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:00,445
Who ever heard of a Mom
and Pop jewelry store?

286
00:22:00,552 --> 00:22:02,747
- What the fuck is that?
- It's in the suburbs, all right.

287
00:22:02,888 --> 00:22:04,685
It's not in the city.

288
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:08,758
I don't know.

289
00:22:10,228 --> 00:22:13,356
We drive out there, we check
it out, if anything looks off,

290
00:22:13,465 --> 00:22:15,626
you know, we just drive away.

291
00:22:16,234 --> 00:22:18,429
We say, we drive our
happy asses home

292
00:22:18,537 --> 00:22:20,630
and I keep the money anyway.

293
00:22:21,873 --> 00:22:23,204
Yeah, fine.

294
00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:25,533
You keep the money anyway.

295
00:22:30,449 --> 00:22:32,383
- Hanson?
- Yeah, that's me.

296
00:22:32,484 --> 00:22:33,746
All right.

297
00:22:57,242 --> 00:22:58,436
- Yeah.
- Bobby, for Christ's sakes,

298
00:22:58,543 --> 00:22:59,532
- Bobby, we got to go.
- Just come on in.

299
00:22:59,644 --> 00:23:01,635
I just got to throw on some clothes.
It'll only take a second.

300
00:23:01,747 --> 00:23:02,873
We got to go.

301
00:23:02,981 --> 00:23:05,211
- Just give me a second.
- God damn it.

302
00:23:06,651 --> 00:23:09,518
Jesus Christ, Bobby,
it's so fucking early.

303
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:12,982
Boo wakes up, you fucking
sit up with him.

304
00:23:13,091 --> 00:23:16,618
- I told you it was work.
- I don't give a fuck what it is.

305
00:23:18,663 --> 00:23:21,427
Chris ain't used to
getting up this early.

306
00:23:24,269 --> 00:23:25,600
Oh, Christ.

307
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:29,302
Come on, babe. Here.

308
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:31,535
- Thank you, baby.
- Yeah, just keep it down, okay?

309
00:23:31,643 --> 00:23:32,837
You wake Boo up,
I'll kick your ass.

310
00:23:32,944 --> 00:23:34,809
- All right.
- Yours, too.

311
00:23:36,948 --> 00:23:38,347
All right.

312
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,014
Come on.

313
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:49,424
All right, let's do it.

314
00:24:37,075 --> 00:24:38,736
- Are we there?
- No.

315
00:25:02,767 --> 00:25:04,064
All right.

316
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:08,169
Who the fuck are you
supposed to be?

317
00:25:08,273 --> 00:25:10,867
Look, I used to work there, all right.
I used to work there

318
00:25:10,976 --> 00:25:13,740
and I can't take a chance on
being recognized. Don't.. Look..

319
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:18,577
- You ain't never done this before, huh?
- Yeah, so?

320
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:21,117
I got to tell you something, you
look like a fucking asshole.

321
00:25:21,219 --> 00:25:24,711
- Yeah, all right, look..
- I'm going to do this on my own.

322
00:25:24,823 --> 00:25:27,553
- Really?
- You do the driving, I do the thing, all right.

323
00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:30,890
- What if you need help?
- I got all the help I need.

324
00:25:32,397 --> 00:25:33,955
There's no shooting.

325
00:25:34,065 --> 00:25:36,158
- I ain't looking for it.
- There's no shooting.

326
00:25:36,268 --> 00:25:37,929
- You do the driving.
- Hey.

327
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:39,298
- I do the thing.
- No shooting.

328
00:25:39,404 --> 00:25:41,634
You ain't got the balls to do the thing.
I got the balls

329
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:43,901
- and I got a gun. That's the deal.
- Listen, no shooting.

330
00:25:44,009 --> 00:25:46,603
- Or else I'm leaving right now.
- Hey, no!

331
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:48,542
Just no shooting, okay?

332
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:02,959
Okay. Ten more minutes.

333
00:26:10,602 --> 00:26:12,263
What the fuck is this?

334
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:14,133
You can listen to that faggoty
shit all the way home.

335
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:16,867
Right now, I got to
get into character.

336
00:26:16,975 --> 00:26:18,567
- Right?
- Okay.

337
00:27:11,496 --> 00:27:12,554
Okay.

338
00:27:13,264 --> 00:27:14,595
This is it.

339
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,828
You ready?

340
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:22,567
Car out front. Door open.
I jump back in. You take off.

341
00:27:22,674 --> 00:27:24,767
- Simple as a pimple, all right.
- Right.

342
00:27:24,876 --> 00:27:26,241
- Right?
- Right.

343
00:27:26,344 --> 00:27:28,278
- Let's do it.
- All right.

344
00:29:16,654 --> 00:29:20,215
Yes, hi, hello. Is Andrew
Hanson available, please?

345
00:29:23,128 --> 00:29:24,117
Uh..

346
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:30,859
Mooney. Mooney. Okay, yeah,
tell him it's Mooney.

347
00:29:33,738 --> 00:29:35,501
- Yeah.
- There's a Mr. Mooney on line two.

348
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:37,302
- He sounds like some nut case.
- Okay.

349
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:39,706
- But..
- All right, I'll take it.

350
00:29:43,348 --> 00:29:44,838
It just came apart, Andy.

351
00:29:45,884 --> 00:29:47,476
Oh, my God, Andy.

352
00:29:48,686 --> 00:29:50,779
What the fuck am I gonna do?

353
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:02,498
No, honey, no, don't worry.
It's just some mistake.

354
00:30:04,035 --> 00:30:05,730
It's either the bank's or mine.

355
00:30:07,205 --> 00:30:10,572
Maybe I didn't put enough
money in the joint account.

356
00:30:11,743 --> 00:30:13,973
Yeah. No. Listen, don't worry.

357
00:30:14,078 --> 00:30:17,514
Of course, we have the cash. I'll
call, I'll take care of it. Okay?

358
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:20,547
Yes, okay?

359
00:31:11,002 --> 00:31:12,162
- Andy?
- Yeah. Yeah.

360
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:13,828
We're waiting for you
in the conference room.

361
00:31:13,938 --> 00:31:15,803
Okay, I'll be right in.

362
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:25,850
Jesus.

363
00:31:27,652 --> 00:31:29,142
Okay, next.

364
00:31:29,254 --> 00:31:31,017
The auditors.

365
00:31:31,122 --> 00:31:34,819
Some of you guys might have heard,
we're getting hit with an IRS audit.

366
00:31:34,926 --> 00:31:37,224
The auditors will
be here on Monday.

367
00:31:37,328 --> 00:31:40,092
They'll spend a day or two
with each department.

368
00:31:40,198 --> 00:31:44,157
On Monday, they'll start with
payroll, so you're up first, Andy.

369
00:31:47,538 --> 00:31:50,905
Great. Great. No problem.

370
00:32:25,176 --> 00:32:26,404
How are you doing today, sir?

371
00:32:27,879 --> 00:32:28,903
Thanks a lot.

372
00:33:12,857 --> 00:33:14,017
Hungry?

373
00:33:17,128 --> 00:33:18,527
Have a drink.

374
00:33:19,931 --> 00:33:21,626
Right, tonic water.

375
00:36:32,156 --> 00:36:33,145
You know,

376
00:36:35,826 --> 00:36:38,522
the thing about real estate
accounting is that you can,

377
00:36:40,097 --> 00:36:42,759
you can head down the
page or across the page,

378
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:47,099
and everything works out. So,
every day, everything adds up.

379
00:36:50,341 --> 00:36:53,970
Well, the total is always
the sum of its parts.

380
00:36:55,246 --> 00:36:57,942
It's clean, it's
clear, neat, absolute.

381
00:37:06,624 --> 00:37:09,320
But my life, it..

382
00:37:11,429 --> 00:37:13,624
It doesn't add up. It's..

383
00:37:17,668 --> 00:37:20,660
Nothing connects to anything else.
It's..

384
00:37:24,842 --> 00:37:27,072
I'm not the sum of my parts.

385
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:35,046
All of my parts don't
add up to one..

386
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:42,453
To one me, I guess.

387
00:37:43,828 --> 00:37:45,693
Get a shrink or a wife.

388
00:37:48,132 --> 00:37:50,225
- I got a wife.
- Get a shrink.

389
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:08,245
Excuse me. Sorry.

390
00:38:15,426 --> 00:38:17,053
Was it me, honey?

391
00:38:18,596 --> 00:38:20,723
What difference does it make?

392
00:38:21,065 --> 00:38:22,930
It's another strikeout.

393
00:38:24,935 --> 00:38:27,768
I swear it would make
a lot of difference.

394
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:32,238
- You're all I want.
- Yeah, well..

395
00:38:34,578 --> 00:38:37,138
I'm a lousy cook. The
house looks like shit.

396
00:38:37,248 --> 00:38:40,547
I'm a lousy lay, I don't
know why you wanna keep me.

397
00:38:45,923 --> 00:38:47,618
You weren't in Rio.

398
00:38:49,427 --> 00:38:50,917
I wasn't what?

399
00:38:51,696 --> 00:38:52,993
Lousy lay.

400
00:39:00,204 --> 00:39:03,002
Well, like you said,
just blame it on Rio.

401
00:39:10,314 --> 00:39:12,373
Suppose I could get
us back there.

402
00:39:12,483 --> 00:39:13,541
What?

403
00:39:14,752 --> 00:39:15,776
Rio.

404
00:39:17,254 --> 00:39:19,222
- To live?
- Absolutely.

405
00:39:22,626 --> 00:39:25,459
- You're just crazy. Crazy.
- No. It's not crazy.

406
00:39:25,563 --> 00:39:29,055
The real estate market's booming in Rio.
There's a lot of new money.

407
00:39:29,734 --> 00:39:31,497
And they're going to want the
same as Europeans, Arabs,

408
00:39:31,602 --> 00:39:36,039
everybody wants real estate in New York,
in America and I know the market here.

409
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:38,540
You don't even speak
the language.

410
00:39:43,114 --> 00:39:46,675
I'll fucking learn it.
Jesus Christ.

411
00:39:50,154 --> 00:39:51,587
You know when..

412
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:57,853
When you met me, my biggest prospect
was inheriting a Mom & Pop jewelry store

413
00:39:57,962 --> 00:40:00,863
in a fucking shopping
mall in Westchester.

414
00:40:02,333 --> 00:40:05,325
Now, I know it's not
Trump Plaza, and..

415
00:40:06,837 --> 00:40:09,806
But just take a look at
how we're living now.

416
00:40:10,441 --> 00:40:12,204
Now, I took that
lousy job in that,

417
00:40:12,309 --> 00:40:15,369
that real estate office, I was
practically a fucking gofer,

418
00:40:15,479 --> 00:40:18,607
and I'm pulling down six figures now.
I'm smart.

419
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:22,712
I know the angles.

420
00:40:23,988 --> 00:40:25,353
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

421
00:40:26,857 --> 00:40:28,188
I bet you do.

422
00:40:29,059 --> 00:40:30,720
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

423
00:40:30,828 --> 00:40:33,160
Well, because there is
no extradition agreement

424
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:35,789
between Brazil and
the United States.

425
00:40:37,334 --> 00:40:38,631
How the..

426
00:40:38,736 --> 00:40:40,761
How the hell do you know that?

427
00:40:40,871 --> 00:40:42,702
I saw it in a movie.

428
00:40:45,676 --> 00:40:48,167
Yeah, I guess I saw
the same movie.

429
00:40:53,484 --> 00:40:55,748
So, what are you thinking?
What are you thinking?

430
00:40:55,853 --> 00:40:58,413
What are you thinking?
What are you thinking?

431
00:40:58,522 --> 00:41:00,353
Don't ask, don't tell.

432
00:41:03,027 --> 00:41:05,359
I just want us to
get back there.

433
00:41:07,198 --> 00:41:10,827
I've seen Heaven, Gina,
it's a nice place to stay.

434
00:41:10,935 --> 00:41:13,768
- Okay? All right?
- Uh-huh.

435
00:41:21,512 --> 00:41:24,879
- What language do they speak there?
- Portuguese.

436
00:41:27,451 --> 00:41:29,817
I speak a little Spanish.

437
00:41:31,255 --> 00:41:35,055
That's.. I'm sorry, sweetheart,
that's not the same language.

438
00:41:35,759 --> 00:41:37,556
- Yes, it is.
- I'm sorry, it's not.

439
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:40,425
- Yes, it is. Yes, it is.
- No.

440
00:41:40,531 --> 00:41:42,431
- Yes, it is.
- Cómo se llama?

441
00:41:43,734 --> 00:41:45,861
- Me llamo..
- Cómo? Me llamo..

442
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:48,430
Gina.

443
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:33,478
Why'd you come to me?

444
00:42:33,817 --> 00:42:36,047
I know you from way back,
I know what you do.

445
00:42:36,153 --> 00:42:37,586
You're a cop.

446
00:42:38,155 --> 00:42:40,783
No, I'm not a cop, I just want to
make sure you're still around.

447
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:43,451
I'll bring you what I've got soon,
either you take it or you don't.

448
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:44,823
But I know you will.

449
00:42:44,929 --> 00:42:47,056
You could work for the cops.

450
00:42:47,965 --> 00:42:49,398
Check me out.

451
00:42:51,936 --> 00:42:53,369
I'll be back.

452
00:43:01,779 --> 00:43:03,269
That's $2,000.

453
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:10,811
It's an advance.

454
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:15,350
See what just that
much does for you,

455
00:43:16,393 --> 00:43:18,884
and imagine the rest.

456
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:39,808
- Yeah, so how do we start? Oh, fuck.
- It's

457
00:43:39,917 --> 00:43:41,544
not we, you.

458
00:43:41,652 --> 00:43:43,085
Me?

459
00:43:43,187 --> 00:43:46,953
What the hell do I know about
robbing a jewelry store?

460
00:43:47,057 --> 00:43:50,925
You'll learn it there.
On-the-job training, you know.

461
00:43:52,730 --> 00:43:54,288
Cut it out, man,
this is serious.

462
00:43:54,398 --> 00:43:58,459
You know, I'm serious as a heart attack.
Listen, number one, I can't..

463
00:43:58,569 --> 00:44:01,037
- I can't go up to the mall.
- Why not?

464
00:44:01,138 --> 00:44:02,400
Oh God, three months ago,

465
00:44:02,506 --> 00:44:04,997
I had to walk the whole goddamn area
with a Home Depot representative,

466
00:44:05,109 --> 00:44:06,576
'cause they were thinking of
buying up a lot of space.

467
00:44:06,677 --> 00:44:08,008
We own a lot of
land in the mall,

468
00:44:08,112 --> 00:44:10,637
and I'm getting a lot of big handshakes.
"Andy, baby, how are you?"

469
00:44:10,748 --> 00:44:11,806
"I haven't seen you in
so long since you left."

470
00:44:11,915 --> 00:44:14,850
And telling me all that bullshit because
they figure I'm making a killing,

471
00:44:14,952 --> 00:44:17,284
because a big chain
wants to buy them out.

472
00:44:17,388 --> 00:44:20,915
I'm saying someone's going to
just recognize me too easy.

473
00:44:21,859 --> 00:44:23,759
So we postpone, just..

474
00:44:24,428 --> 00:44:28,023
Yeah, we could, you
know, wait a year.

475
00:44:31,535 --> 00:44:34,504
I mean, I don't know about you,
my problems are pressing.

476
00:44:34,605 --> 00:44:38,166
Jesus, Andy, I.. Andy!

477
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:41,645
- I wouldn't even know how to start, I mean.
- Well, you can stop being a baby.

478
00:44:41,745 --> 00:44:43,372
- I'm not being a..
- Yeah, you're being a baby.

479
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:46,972
Get a gun. You get a toy
gun in a kid's store.

480
00:44:47,084 --> 00:44:50,019
Right, that old lady that works
on Saturday, what's her name?

481
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:52,111
- Doris?
- Yeah, Doris, Mom's friend.

482
00:44:52,222 --> 00:44:55,953
She's what, 60, 70?
She's blind as a bat?

483
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:57,891
Look at me. Blind as a bat.

484
00:44:58,328 --> 00:45:01,354
All right, those toy guns, they look
so real, they fool cops all the time.

485
00:45:01,465 --> 00:45:03,126
All right, you go in at 8:00
a.m., just as she opens up.

486
00:45:03,233 --> 00:45:05,793
You put her old ass in the back
room, you empty the vault,

487
00:45:05,903 --> 00:45:09,361
the cash, the trays and you
dump it in a fucking sack.

488
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:12,676
All right. You don't
gotta be neat about it.

489
00:45:14,978 --> 00:45:19,574
Jesus, Andy, I don't know. I
don't know, I don't.. I..

490
00:45:19,683 --> 00:45:21,116
I don't know.

491
00:45:27,257 --> 00:45:29,418
Okay. Come on.

492
00:45:34,298 --> 00:45:35,788
You can do it.

493
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,490
You can do it.

494
00:45:39,136 --> 00:45:40,535
Anybody can.

495
00:45:42,306 --> 00:45:45,764
- I just think..
- I know, I know. It's too late to think.

496
00:45:47,845 --> 00:45:49,335
It's too late.

497
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:52,878
This is our future.

498
00:46:01,024 --> 00:46:02,116
Okay.

499
00:46:18,075 --> 00:46:20,168
- Yeah.
- There's a Mr. Mooney on line two.

500
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:22,472
He sounds like some nut case.
But..

501
00:46:22,579 --> 00:46:24,069
Okay, I got it.

502
00:46:27,217 --> 00:46:29,185
It just came apart, Andy.

503
00:46:31,021 --> 00:46:32,386
Oh, my God, Andy.

504
00:46:35,893 --> 00:46:37,986
What the fuck am I gonna do?

505
00:46:40,531 --> 00:46:41,555
Could he be in a different wing?

506
00:46:41,665 --> 00:46:44,293
If you just pipe down a second,
sir, I'm trying to help you.

507
00:46:44,401 --> 00:46:45,868
- What are you doing here?
- Keep quiet one minute.

508
00:46:45,969 --> 00:46:47,698
Dad called me, all right.
I just got here.

509
00:46:47,805 --> 00:46:50,205
- This lady, she doesn't..
- Look, Miss, our father.. I got it.

510
00:46:50,307 --> 00:46:53,902
- I got it. I know, but you might..
- I told him, we've got no Charles Hanson.

511
00:46:54,011 --> 00:46:56,605
Wait a minute, I got
a Nanette Hanson.

512
00:46:57,881 --> 00:47:00,372
- What?
- There's a Nanette Hanson.

513
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:03,180
- Brought in about three hours ago.
- What?

514
00:47:04,688 --> 00:47:06,178
Gunshot wounds.

515
00:47:07,524 --> 00:47:10,084
- Where is she?
- Emergency ICU.

516
00:47:10,194 --> 00:47:14,893
Hey. Now. Hey, hold it. Wait,
are you related? Sir? Are you?

517
00:47:20,337 --> 00:47:21,361
Dad?

518
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,307
She's unconscious.

519
00:47:32,916 --> 00:47:34,247
And they..

520
00:47:35,552 --> 00:47:36,712
She's..

521
00:47:38,822 --> 00:47:39,914
They..

522
00:47:41,391 --> 00:47:42,722
They say..

523
00:48:00,010 --> 00:48:01,602
So, how are you feeling?

524
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:03,304
Yeah, I feel old.

525
00:48:04,781 --> 00:48:07,716
I've been studying all week,
and I can't retain a thing.

526
00:48:07,818 --> 00:48:10,810
Come on, you're going to pass
with flying colors, Dad.

527
00:48:10,921 --> 00:48:15,119
That's how I'm going to spend my
birthday, taking that stupid test.

528
00:48:15,225 --> 00:48:16,453
Have you spoken
to your brothers?

529
00:48:18,195 --> 00:48:19,492
Few weeks ago.

530
00:48:19,596 --> 00:48:21,757
Yeah? How are they?

531
00:48:24,067 --> 00:48:25,728
Busy.

532
00:48:25,836 --> 00:48:29,203
You know, Dad, Hank is
Hank and Andy's Andy.

533
00:48:31,475 --> 00:48:35,036
No more cramming, birthday boy.
It's the moment of truth.

534
00:48:36,647 --> 00:48:38,945
What time is Doris
coming to the store?

535
00:48:39,049 --> 00:48:41,108
She said 12:00 at the latest.

536
00:48:41,218 --> 00:48:43,778
She has to baby-sit
for her daughter.

537
00:48:44,421 --> 00:48:46,981
I'll pick you up
right after my test.

538
00:48:49,226 --> 00:48:50,750
Come on, come on.

539
00:48:51,328 --> 00:48:53,660
All right, all right, all right.

540
00:49:09,513 --> 00:49:11,981
- Perfect score, Mr. Hanson.
- Bingo!

541
00:49:13,884 --> 00:49:15,442
Congratulations.

542
00:49:16,186 --> 00:49:18,586
If you'll take this to Window C,

543
00:49:19,823 --> 00:49:21,222
they'll give you the eye test.

544
00:49:21,925 --> 00:49:24,621
I might not do so
well on that one.

545
00:49:24,728 --> 00:49:28,164
- I've been studying hard, of course. Thanks.
- All right.

546
00:49:59,429 --> 00:50:01,397
That's my store!

547
00:50:02,232 --> 00:50:04,257
- What happened? What's happening?
- Let's go!

548
00:50:04,368 --> 00:50:06,165
- Sir, sir, just stay behind the yellow line.
- What's happening?

549
00:50:06,269 --> 00:50:07,964
- I want to know what's happening.
- Behind the yellow line.

550
00:50:08,071 --> 00:50:10,596
- Where's my wife? Where's my wife?
- Calm down. Please calm down.

551
00:50:46,376 --> 00:50:47,707
I love you.

552
00:50:56,953 --> 00:51:02,357
There are more tests we can do, but from
what we've seen so far, it's very unlikely.

553
00:51:03,493 --> 00:51:05,290
There's no brain activity.

554
00:51:05,395 --> 00:51:09,661
And statistically speaking, there's
very little chance for recovery.

555
00:51:15,405 --> 00:51:17,134
Why was Mom working?

556
00:51:18,408 --> 00:51:21,206
I thought she didn't work at the store
anymore, that's what Katherine told me.

557
00:51:21,311 --> 00:51:25,941
Doris had to baby-sit, I had to get
down to the DMV, get my eyes tested.

558
00:51:28,785 --> 00:51:30,548
Today's my birthday.

559
00:51:31,822 --> 00:51:33,551
Where's your brother?

560
00:51:38,528 --> 00:51:39,586
He..

561
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:44,700
He says he can't take it.
To let him know if..

562
00:51:44,801 --> 00:51:48,066
If he can help, but he just
can't see her like that.

563
00:52:32,115 --> 00:52:33,742
He's 28 years old.

564
00:52:34,718 --> 00:52:36,811
He's a goddamn punk
from Red Hook.

565
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:40,856
Red Hook. What was he doing up here?
What in the fucking world? What he..

566
00:52:40,957 --> 00:52:44,290
I mean, did he put a map on
the wall and throw a dart?

567
00:52:47,998 --> 00:52:51,866
It's so absurd. It's
so goddamn arbitrary.

568
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:54,762
Why me? Why her?

569
00:52:55,138 --> 00:52:57,698
What was this goddamn kid doing?

570
00:52:59,709 --> 00:53:01,404
You belong in hell.

571
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:05,878
Yeah. I understand. All right.
Thank you.

572
00:53:06,516 --> 00:53:09,144
Look, it might be better if you
call, make an appointment?

573
00:53:09,252 --> 00:53:11,083
Well, I'd rather wait.

574
00:53:12,622 --> 00:53:15,216
Please. Steve..

575
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:51,884
Dad.

576
00:53:54,598 --> 00:53:56,964
You have to make
a decision, Dad.

577
00:54:00,370 --> 00:54:01,735
The gun was bought in Texas.

578
00:54:01,838 --> 00:54:05,239
Stolen Texas driver's
license, his ID, fake,

579
00:54:06,876 --> 00:54:10,141
the gun turns up in New
York, a year later.

580
00:54:10,247 --> 00:54:13,045
- Mom needs you to make a decision, Dad.
- Andy, just leave him alone.

581
00:54:13,149 --> 00:54:15,014
Well, something has to be done,
he has to make a decision.

582
00:54:15,118 --> 00:54:16,745
Just leave him to his
grief for one minute.

583
00:54:16,853 --> 00:54:20,311
- Mom is in the hands of Jesus.
- Now, will you cut it out with that crap?

584
00:54:20,423 --> 00:54:22,687
You shouldn't push Dad to make a
decision he doesn't wanna make.

585
00:54:22,792 --> 00:54:24,350
Well, he has to make a decision.

586
00:54:31,635 --> 00:54:33,125
Hey, Patrick.

587
00:55:28,525 --> 00:55:30,959
We know it's
difficult, Mr. Hanson.

588
00:55:54,284 --> 00:55:55,615
Let her go.

589
00:56:01,925 --> 00:56:03,290
Let her go.

590
00:56:06,429 --> 00:56:07,828
Let her go.

591
00:56:12,936 --> 00:56:15,461
"Almighty and ever living God."

592
00:56:15,572 --> 00:56:20,669
"Remember the mercy with which you graced
your daughter, Nanette, in this life."

593
00:56:20,777 --> 00:56:25,578
"Receive her, we pray, into
the mansions of the saints."

594
00:56:25,682 --> 00:56:29,083
"As we make ready our
sister's resting place"

595
00:56:29,185 --> 00:56:32,450
"Look also with favor
on those who mourn."

596
00:56:32,889 --> 00:56:35,414
"And comfort them in their loss."

597
00:56:35,925 --> 00:56:40,055
"Because God has chosen to
call Nanette from this life,"

598
00:56:40,797 --> 00:56:45,666
"commit her body to the earth, for we
are dust and to dust we shall return."

599
00:56:45,769 --> 00:56:48,670
I'm so sorry for your loss.
She was a wonderful person.

600
00:56:49,706 --> 00:56:50,866
- She was a wonderful woman.
- Yes.

601
00:56:50,974 --> 00:56:54,034
- I'm so sorry.
- You have my deepest condolences.

602
00:56:54,377 --> 00:56:56,038
She was a dear friend.

603
00:56:56,146 --> 00:56:57,841
So sorry for your loss, your
mother was a good person.

604
00:56:57,947 --> 00:56:59,414
I'm so sorry.

605
00:57:00,517 --> 00:57:01,984
God bless you.

606
00:57:03,186 --> 00:57:06,087
There's no way I can
make this scene, Andy.

607
00:57:08,858 --> 00:57:10,849
He was always such a baby.

608
00:57:25,608 --> 00:57:26,597
Yeah.

609
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:32,775
I can't really talk right now.

610
00:57:34,617 --> 00:57:35,948
I can't, I..

611
00:57:36,052 --> 00:57:38,077
I have to go. Andy needs me.

612
00:58:31,341 --> 00:58:32,603
22nd precinct.

613
00:58:32,709 --> 00:58:34,677
Detective Barrett, please.

614
00:58:34,811 --> 00:58:36,506
Just a moment, sir.

615
00:58:39,616 --> 00:58:40,981
I'm sorry, he's
not in right now.

616
00:58:41,084 --> 00:58:45,851
Is there anyone down there that knows
anything about the Nanette Hanson case?

617
00:58:45,955 --> 00:58:48,981
- Who's speaking, please?
- Charles Hanson, yeah.

618
00:58:50,894 --> 00:58:52,623
Just a moment, sir.

619
00:58:57,300 --> 00:58:58,961
Sergeant Sullivan.

620
00:58:59,068 --> 00:59:00,592
Yeah, good morning, Sergeant.

621
00:59:00,703 --> 00:59:04,867
I've been trying to reach Detective
Barrett but he doesn't return my calls.

622
00:59:04,974 --> 00:59:06,407
Would you like to
leave a message, sir?

623
00:59:06,509 --> 00:59:09,535
No, I wouldn't like to
leave another message.

624
00:59:09,646 --> 00:59:11,546
Doesn't anyone down
there give a damn?

625
00:59:11,648 --> 00:59:13,513
Doesn't anyone down there
work for a living?

626
00:59:13,616 --> 00:59:15,914
Would you like to
leave a message, sir?

627
01:00:21,718 --> 01:00:23,345
Don't you know how
important this is to me?

628
01:00:23,453 --> 01:00:25,114
I know, I just..

629
01:00:25,221 --> 01:00:28,418
You know, I thought I was going
to be able to work it out, but..

630
01:00:28,524 --> 01:00:30,958
But I couldn't get the
money together, you know.

631
01:00:31,060 --> 01:00:33,494
All my friends think I'm going to be
there, what am I going to tell them?

632
01:00:33,596 --> 01:00:36,156
You know, I mean, there's going
to be other field trips.

633
01:00:36,265 --> 01:00:38,199
Not to The Lion
King, there won't.

634
01:00:38,301 --> 01:00:40,963
Look, Dad, if you weren't going to pay
for it, you should have just said so

635
01:00:41,070 --> 01:00:44,528
and saved me the humiliation of having to
tell all my friends that you're a loser.

636
01:01:17,106 --> 01:01:20,598
Hey, this is Hank. I must be out,
so leave a message at the beep.

637
01:01:22,011 --> 01:01:24,036
I know you're there.
Pick up the phone.

638
01:01:26,282 --> 01:01:27,943
Pick up the phone.

639
01:01:28,818 --> 01:01:31,787
Pick up the fucking phone,
you fucking faggot.

640
01:01:34,057 --> 01:01:36,617
- Andy, I'm here.
- Where have you been?

641
01:01:37,894 --> 01:01:40,260
Here. I called in sick.

642
01:01:42,031 --> 01:01:44,932
And what the fuck were you doing
with that fucking asshole?

643
01:01:46,135 --> 01:01:48,433
- I was scared, all right? So I..
- I didn't say anything about

644
01:01:48,538 --> 01:01:50,529
a fucking gun, God damn it.

645
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:52,335
But we got to talk.

646
01:01:52,575 --> 01:01:53,542
Andy.

647
01:01:54,177 --> 01:01:55,906
Meet me at Mooney's.

648
01:01:56,145 --> 01:01:57,840
You still can't get by?
To see Mom?

649
01:01:58,414 --> 01:02:01,645
- What am I going to say?
- Don't say anything. Fuck.

650
01:02:02,285 --> 01:02:03,547
- Who else knows?
- Nobody.

651
01:02:03,653 --> 01:02:05,553
- You didn't tell anyone?
- No.

652
01:02:05,655 --> 01:02:07,850
- No one saw you talking with Bobby?
- No.

653
01:02:07,990 --> 01:02:09,252
All right. Nobody saw you here?

654
01:02:09,358 --> 01:02:12,589
No, come on, it was crowded,
it was busy. No, no.

655
01:02:12,695 --> 01:02:14,458
- Did he rent the car with you?
- Did he what?

656
01:02:14,564 --> 01:02:16,589
- Did he rent the fucking car with you?
- No, no, no.

657
01:02:16,699 --> 01:02:18,257
All right, did you..

658
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:19,664
- You picked him up?
- Yeah.

659
01:02:19,769 --> 01:02:22,431
- At his house.
- Did anyone see you there, at his house?

660
01:02:22,705 --> 01:02:24,366
- Did anyone see you at his house?
- No, no.

661
01:02:24,474 --> 01:02:26,840
- Nobody saw you at the house?
- No.

662
01:02:31,180 --> 01:02:33,808
Did you clean the car? Did
you wipe the car down?

663
01:02:33,916 --> 01:02:36,976
- Did you wipe the floor?
- Yeah, I totally.. Totally, totally.

664
01:02:38,888 --> 01:02:42,324
- Did you leave anything in the car?
- No, of course not.

665
01:02:54,904 --> 01:02:56,667
We're probably okay.

666
01:02:58,007 --> 01:03:01,534
If they don't connect the car
to us, we're probably okay.

667
01:03:02,478 --> 01:03:04,605
That's what I was thinking.

668
01:03:05,314 --> 01:03:07,976
- Go back to work, totally normal.
- Okay.

669
01:03:10,353 --> 01:03:12,548
I'm so sorry, Andy. I'm sorry.

670
01:03:17,627 --> 01:03:19,891
I don't think I can
get through this.

671
01:03:19,996 --> 01:03:21,122
Shut up.

672
01:03:21,230 --> 01:03:24,165
- I loved her so much.
- Just shut the fuck up.

673
01:03:26,869 --> 01:03:30,669
If he had to take somebody out,
why couldn't it have been him?

674
01:03:47,023 --> 01:03:48,854
One new message.

675
01:03:48,958 --> 01:03:52,826
This is Mike Steuben calling from
Auto Rent for Mr. Henry Hanson.

676
01:03:53,196 --> 01:03:55,790
Mr. Hanson, you returned
a car the other day.

677
01:03:55,898 --> 01:03:58,093
It seems you forgot some
personal items in it.

678
01:03:58,201 --> 01:04:03,571
Please give me a call at 555-2649
and ask for Mike Steuben.

679
01:04:03,806 --> 01:04:08,004
Again, that number is 555-2649.
Thank you.

680
01:04:10,613 --> 01:04:12,103
End of messages.

681
01:04:14,317 --> 01:04:16,581
Okay. God.

682
01:04:20,456 --> 01:04:21,548
Okay.

683
01:04:23,659 --> 01:04:27,459
Hello, you've reached Auto Rent.
Our office is currently closed.

684
01:04:27,563 --> 01:04:28,587
- Our business hours..
- Fuck.

685
01:04:28,698 --> 01:04:29,892
Fuck!

686
01:04:32,168 --> 01:04:35,228
Okay. All right. It's
okay, it's okay.

687
01:04:49,318 --> 01:04:50,410
Excuse me?

688
01:04:50,753 --> 01:04:53,313
That's right, sir.
It's $255 plus tax.

689
01:04:53,422 --> 01:04:56,687
But for an additional $17, I
could upgrade you to a luxury.

690
01:04:56,893 --> 01:04:58,383
Or, for.. Yes.

691
01:04:58,828 --> 01:05:01,922
No, that's right, the
mid-size is $255 plus tax.

692
01:05:02,365 --> 01:05:05,596
Unless you'd like to upgrade to an
SUV, which I could offer you for 29..

693
01:05:05,701 --> 01:05:08,329
Excuse me, is Mike Steuben here? No,
I know, I'm just looking for Mike.

694
01:05:08,437 --> 01:05:10,200
So, would you like to
upgrade to the SUV?

695
01:05:10,940 --> 01:05:13,170
No, no. No, mid-size
is fine, sir.

696
01:05:13,709 --> 01:05:14,869
No.

697
01:05:14,977 --> 01:05:16,877
Thank you for calling.

698
01:05:16,979 --> 01:05:17,946
I'm sorry.

699
01:05:18,314 --> 01:05:19,542
Good morning, how can
I help you, sir?

700
01:05:19,649 --> 01:05:22,812
Yeah, I got a message
from Mike Steuben.

701
01:05:22,919 --> 01:05:25,649
Apparently I left
something in a vehicle

702
01:05:25,755 --> 01:05:28,121
that I returned last Saturday.
I think it was a CD.

703
01:05:28,224 --> 01:05:30,988
Oh, well, you would talk to
Mr. Steuben, then. He's the manager.

704
01:05:31,093 --> 01:05:33,152
Yeah, I know, so could
I speak with him?

705
01:05:33,262 --> 01:05:35,230
I'm sorry, he's not here.
You'll have to come back.

706
01:05:36,432 --> 01:05:38,423
- When will he be in?
- I don't..

707
01:05:38,534 --> 01:05:39,933
He won't be in at all today.

708
01:05:40,036 --> 01:05:42,402
Well then, maybe
you can help me.

709
01:05:42,505 --> 01:05:43,972
Oh, no. Sorry, sir.

710
01:05:44,073 --> 01:05:45,540
I'm sorry, excuse me.

711
01:05:45,641 --> 01:05:46,972
- Do you think..
- I'm sorry.

712
01:05:47,076 --> 01:05:49,636
- Will he be in tomorrow?
- Yes, Auto Rent.

713
01:05:49,745 --> 01:05:50,871
No, I..

714
01:05:51,681 --> 01:05:54,741
No, I didn't say that, sir.
That's not up to me.

715
01:05:55,051 --> 01:05:56,040
No.

716
01:05:56,152 --> 01:05:58,814
Excuse me, can I get a beer?
Thanks.

717
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:06,553
That's the guy, that's him.

718
01:06:13,803 --> 01:06:15,134
Yo, buddy.

719
01:06:16,939 --> 01:06:18,907
- This guy?
- Yeah.

720
01:06:20,042 --> 01:06:22,772
You were with Bobby
Lasorda, Saturday?

721
01:06:23,446 --> 01:06:25,971
- What?
- I asked you a fucking question.

722
01:06:26,349 --> 01:06:28,613
What? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

723
01:06:30,052 --> 01:06:31,644
- What's your name?
- I'm Hank.

724
01:06:31,754 --> 01:06:33,346
- Hank what?
- You know what?

725
01:06:33,456 --> 01:06:35,788
Come. Why don't you.. Let's go.

726
01:06:35,992 --> 01:06:38,392
Follow me, we can
talk over here.

727
01:06:43,432 --> 01:06:45,059
- Come on. Have a seat.
- Is this all right?

728
01:06:45,167 --> 01:06:46,691
Yeah, this is perfect.

729
01:06:47,503 --> 01:06:48,470
So..

730
01:06:52,775 --> 01:06:54,834
What's the deal, huh?

731
01:06:54,944 --> 01:06:58,744
- My sister is quite all of a sudden a widow.
- Yeah.

732
01:06:58,848 --> 01:07:01,248
She says you and
Bobby had some work.

733
01:07:01,584 --> 01:07:02,573
Bobby said it was work.

734
01:07:02,685 --> 01:07:05,711
Work that involved him
getting shot and killed,

735
01:07:05,821 --> 01:07:07,982
but not you getting
shot and killed.

736
01:07:08,090 --> 01:07:10,149
No, I just got him the car.

737
01:07:10,259 --> 01:07:12,625
- I'm so sorry.
- What the fuck does that mean?

738
01:07:12,728 --> 01:07:16,664
Well, Bobby said that he needed
to rent a car, but that he..

739
01:07:16,766 --> 01:07:20,258
This was Friday night

740
01:07:20,369 --> 01:07:24,135
and he didn't have a credit card, so I
told him that I would rent him a car.

741
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:28,176
And I owed him some money. You know.
That's it, I swear. It's..

742
01:07:28,577 --> 01:07:30,010
I'm so sorry.

743
01:07:30,479 --> 01:07:32,606
- So what? You're lying.
- No, I'm not.

744
01:07:32,715 --> 01:07:35,309
Because if Bobby wanted a car, he
would have fucking stolen one.

745
01:07:35,418 --> 01:07:38,512
Chris, go fucking wait outside.

746
01:07:38,621 --> 01:07:40,316
Let me handle this.

747
01:07:48,798 --> 01:07:50,663
You got a driver's license?

748
01:07:51,667 --> 01:07:53,259
- A what?
- You know, the..

749
01:07:53,369 --> 01:07:56,133
The driver's license you
show when you rent a car?

750
01:07:56,238 --> 01:07:57,364
Yeah.

751
01:07:57,473 --> 01:07:59,134
- Let me see it.
- Yeah.

752
01:08:00,209 --> 01:08:01,801
All right, sure.

753
01:08:02,378 --> 01:08:03,436
Here.

754
01:08:06,782 --> 01:08:09,012
- Henry Hanson.
- Yeah.

755
01:08:09,785 --> 01:08:11,082
This is your address, right?

756
01:08:12,254 --> 01:08:13,983
Yeah, sure.

757
01:08:14,690 --> 01:08:16,555
I'm going to be straight
with you, chico.

758
01:08:16,926 --> 01:08:19,053
You mind if I call you chico?

759
01:08:19,161 --> 01:08:20,788
People call me Hank.

760
01:08:20,896 --> 01:08:23,023
Bobby was a piece of shit.

761
01:08:23,132 --> 01:08:25,566
I know it, you know it.
That's not the point.

762
01:08:25,668 --> 01:08:30,571
The point is that piece of shit was
the father of my sister's child.

763
01:08:31,340 --> 01:08:33,137
And he was paying the bills.

764
01:08:33,242 --> 01:08:34,402
And now he's dead.

765
01:08:34,510 --> 01:08:37,843
And I'm thinking, who's going
to pay all these bills?

766
01:08:38,948 --> 01:08:40,176
I'm so sorry.

767
01:08:40,282 --> 01:08:42,307
Sorry ain't going to
pay the bills, chico.

768
01:08:42,418 --> 01:08:43,908
I know, I know.

769
01:08:45,087 --> 01:08:48,579
We need to negotiate a
settlement, so make me an offer.

770
01:08:48,958 --> 01:08:52,826
Ten grand, done. It's 10 grand.
I consider us even.

771
01:08:52,928 --> 01:08:54,919
If you don't like 10,
I can make it 15.

772
01:08:55,030 --> 01:08:57,521
- No.
- My sister wants me to kill you.

773
01:08:59,335 --> 01:09:01,326
Or I could call the cops.

774
01:09:02,204 --> 01:09:03,728
But I don't like cops.

775
01:09:03,839 --> 01:09:06,899
And the cops ain't going
to pay my sister's bills.

776
01:09:07,810 --> 01:09:11,041
So, I think a settlement
is pretty fair all-around.

777
01:09:15,251 --> 01:09:18,049
- Day after tomorrow, chico.
- Can I?

778
01:09:18,154 --> 01:09:19,985
Here. 8:00.

779
01:09:26,128 --> 01:09:27,789
You fucking crazy?

780
01:09:27,897 --> 01:09:31,924
I was hoping that you had something
left over from the settlement.

781
01:09:34,570 --> 01:09:37,596
Lend you money? You
owe me $2,000.

782
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:39,867
Shocked to shit you'd even ask.

783
01:09:39,975 --> 01:09:41,135
Martha,

784
01:09:44,246 --> 01:09:46,111
I'm in serious trouble.

785
01:09:47,082 --> 01:09:49,141
I don't give a shit what
kind of trouble you're in.

786
01:09:49,251 --> 01:09:52,516
The next time you show up
here, better be to pay me.

787
01:09:57,193 --> 01:09:59,593
Listen, tell
Danielle I love her.

788
01:10:00,029 --> 01:10:03,430
If you loved her, you'd pay
her fucking child support.

789
01:10:41,337 --> 01:10:43,965
I'm so sorry for your loss.
She was a wonderful person.

790
01:10:44,073 --> 01:10:45,938
Wonderful woman.

791
01:10:46,642 --> 01:10:48,075
She was a wonderful woman.

792
01:10:50,579 --> 01:10:52,046
God bless you.

793
01:10:55,017 --> 01:10:57,884
There's no way I can
make this scene, Andy.

794
01:11:03,092 --> 01:11:05,083
He was always such a baby.

795
01:11:19,241 --> 01:11:20,230
Yeah.

796
01:11:20,342 --> 01:11:23,368
- Hey, Gina.
- I can't really talk right now.

797
01:11:23,646 --> 01:11:25,341
Andy needs me. I got to go.

798
01:11:25,447 --> 01:11:26,880
Gina, Gina.

799
01:11:34,690 --> 01:11:36,851
Excuse me, is Mike Steuben here?

800
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:39,393
- Not till noon, can I help you?
- Yeah, yeah.

801
01:11:39,495 --> 01:11:43,397
I returned a car last Saturday
and I guess I forgot something.

802
01:11:43,966 --> 01:11:45,126
Hanson?

803
01:11:45,467 --> 01:11:49,062
That's right, Hanson. Yeah, and
I'm pretty sure it was a CD.

804
01:11:49,171 --> 01:11:50,365
Hang on.

805
01:11:54,043 --> 01:11:55,908
Here we go, Mr. Hanson.

806
01:11:56,912 --> 01:11:59,380
- Great.
- I just need to see some ID.

807
01:12:02,384 --> 01:12:04,443
Yeah, you know, I..

808
01:12:04,787 --> 01:12:07,119
I lost my license.

809
01:12:08,624 --> 01:12:12,560
You have a credit card, the one
you used to rent the car with?

810
01:12:13,996 --> 01:12:15,463
Yeah.

811
01:12:16,799 --> 01:12:18,926
- Yeah, this one.
- All right.

812
01:12:20,102 --> 01:12:21,831
Okay, great.

813
01:12:22,438 --> 01:12:24,269
- Thank you.
- Take care.

814
01:13:03,846 --> 01:13:05,871
- Hello?
- It's me.

815
01:13:05,981 --> 01:13:08,745
Andy, Jesus! Fuck,
man, we got problems.

816
01:13:34,910 --> 01:13:37,470
Hi, Andy. This is
Jake at the office.

817
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:41,574
Really sorry to bother you, but
the auditors are coming tomorrow.

818
01:13:42,317 --> 01:13:44,478
They've noticed a few problems.

819
01:13:44,586 --> 01:13:47,919
It's pretty urgent, so give
a call when you get this.

820
01:13:50,359 --> 01:13:53,453
You're going to have to
get some sleep tonight.

821
01:13:56,865 --> 01:13:59,561
Have you given any
thought to the store?

822
01:14:05,240 --> 01:14:09,939
I mean, you're going to have to give it
some consideration. It's just gonna..

823
01:14:13,348 --> 01:14:17,444
I could open it up for you, you
know, while you're at the hospital.

824
01:14:17,719 --> 01:14:19,346
A few hours a day.

825
01:14:19,922 --> 01:14:22,254
So people know
you're still there.

826
01:14:25,194 --> 01:14:28,459
I should burn the
goddamn place down.

827
01:14:39,475 --> 01:14:41,067
Andy, this is Jake.

828
01:14:41,176 --> 01:14:44,304
Now I hope you're checking your messages
because we have a real mess here.

829
01:14:45,414 --> 01:14:48,247
The auditors say that there's
two terminated employees

830
01:14:48,350 --> 01:14:50,284
from your department
still drawing checks.

831
01:14:50,385 --> 01:14:53,377
And there's something
about unpaid OASDI taxes.

832
01:14:53,789 --> 01:14:55,882
Look, you need to call us..

833
01:15:00,596 --> 01:15:02,791
I got to go to the
office tomorrow.

834
01:15:02,898 --> 01:15:06,959
There's a problem. I'll go in the morning.
I should be back later.

835
01:15:07,135 --> 01:15:08,329
Okay?

836
01:15:08,437 --> 01:15:11,065
His mother's dying, and
he's going back to work.

837
01:15:11,173 --> 01:15:12,197
Yes!

838
01:15:24,820 --> 01:15:25,809
Pick up the phone.

839
01:15:25,921 --> 01:15:27,718
I know you're there, pick up
the phone, you fucking faggot.

840
01:15:29,791 --> 01:15:31,418
Andy, I'm here.

841
01:15:32,828 --> 01:15:35,126
What are you doing here? You
don't have an appointment.

842
01:15:35,230 --> 01:15:37,494
- You know the deal, you can't just show up.
- I know, I'm sorry.

843
01:15:37,599 --> 01:15:39,999
Come back in an
hour, tonic water.

844
01:16:14,770 --> 01:16:16,203
My mom's dying.

845
01:16:18,807 --> 01:16:19,967
Bummer.

846
01:16:22,411 --> 01:16:24,675
Next time, make an appointment.

847
01:16:41,496 --> 01:16:42,690
Stupid piece of shit.

848
01:16:42,798 --> 01:16:45,358
Stop talking to me like that.

849
01:16:45,467 --> 01:16:48,630
What the fuck?

850
01:16:50,505 --> 01:16:52,564
Are you going to get tough?

851
01:16:53,342 --> 01:16:55,207
Are you going to hurt me?

852
01:16:58,246 --> 01:16:59,577
Why was there even a gun?

853
01:16:59,681 --> 01:17:01,842
Why was there even
a fucking gun?

854
01:17:01,950 --> 01:17:05,317
I gave you all the information you needed.
Why was Bobby Lasorda even there?

855
01:17:05,420 --> 01:17:08,719
- Why the fuck?
- I didn't think I could do it alone.

856
01:17:16,365 --> 01:17:18,526
I should fucking kill you.

857
01:17:29,378 --> 01:17:33,508
How are we going to fix it so
your shit don't fall on my shoes?

858
01:17:36,284 --> 01:17:38,047
So, think now, who else knows?

859
01:17:39,221 --> 01:17:41,280
"Commit her body to the earth."

860
01:17:41,390 --> 01:17:44,359
"For we are dust and to
dust we shall return."

861
01:17:45,027 --> 01:17:49,555
"But the Lord Jesus will change our
mortal bodies to be like his in glory."

862
01:18:13,221 --> 01:18:15,985
She hated it when I barbecued.

863
01:18:42,084 --> 01:18:46,214
I'm sorry I wasn't able to
be what you wanted me to be.

864
01:18:47,923 --> 01:18:50,915
I've never been very good
at talking about feelings

865
01:18:51,026 --> 01:18:54,860
or showing you that kind
of affection or support.

866
01:18:58,467 --> 01:18:59,729
I'm sorry.

867
01:19:01,436 --> 01:19:04,234
I wasn't able to be the
father you wanted.

868
01:19:06,575 --> 01:19:09,806
But I guess I wanted you
to be better than me.

869
01:19:10,512 --> 01:19:12,742
And I thought that if I push..

870
01:19:18,854 --> 01:19:22,449
It may not mean anything to
you, but I want you to know

871
01:19:24,025 --> 01:19:26,016
that I really do love you.

872
01:19:29,297 --> 01:19:31,322
And I'm.. I'm sorry.

873
01:19:34,536 --> 01:19:35,628
I'm just so sorry.

874
01:19:35,737 --> 01:19:38,638
I'm sorry I wasn't able
to be the son you wanted.

875
01:19:41,476 --> 01:19:43,535
You did the best you could.

876
01:19:45,847 --> 01:19:47,280
Still, yeah.

877
01:19:47,449 --> 01:19:50,111
Manage to seem to
still like Hank.

878
01:19:50,285 --> 01:19:53,083
He was a lot more of a
fuck-up than I was.

879
01:19:53,288 --> 01:19:55,188
- He was the baby.
- Yeah.

880
01:19:56,124 --> 01:19:59,093
- He needed us more.
- Yeah, he needed you more.

881
01:19:59,327 --> 01:20:01,955
You sure it wasn't his cute
looks or his puppiness?

882
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:06,495
You were the first.

883
01:20:06,902 --> 01:20:08,961
The first always has it rougher.

884
01:20:09,070 --> 01:20:10,662
Yeah, so I'm told.

885
01:20:13,742 --> 01:20:17,940
You know, the four of you, I never
felt like I was part of the club.

886
01:20:19,915 --> 01:20:22,076
Beautiful birds of a feather.

887
01:20:24,886 --> 01:20:26,717
You sure I'm your son?

888
01:20:42,904 --> 01:20:45,805
Gina and I have got to
get back to the city.

889
01:21:10,632 --> 01:21:11,792
Andy?

890
01:21:14,269 --> 01:21:15,566
My dad.

891
01:21:16,872 --> 01:21:18,339
Andy.

892
01:21:23,478 --> 01:21:24,536
Okay.

893
01:21:26,381 --> 01:21:28,246
Why don't we pull over?

894
01:21:45,734 --> 01:21:46,928
My dad.

895
01:21:52,307 --> 01:21:53,467
Oh, God.

896
01:21:58,413 --> 01:22:01,610
It's not fair! It's not fair!

897
01:22:02,951 --> 01:22:06,785
All my life I've been afraid of
becoming like him. All my life!

898
01:22:06,888 --> 01:22:09,686
All my life with you,
and it's not fair.

899
01:22:10,358 --> 01:22:13,191
He can't just say he's sorry
and make it all go away.

900
01:22:13,295 --> 01:22:14,284
It's too late.

901
01:22:14,396 --> 01:22:15,761
It's not that easy!

902
01:22:15,864 --> 01:22:19,231
It's not fair! It's
not fucking fair!

903
01:22:23,939 --> 01:22:25,304
No, Dad.

904
01:22:27,342 --> 01:22:28,900
Oh, God!

905
01:22:32,547 --> 01:22:34,242
He can't do that!

906
01:22:40,488 --> 01:22:41,580
Andy.

907
01:22:54,569 --> 01:22:55,536
Andy.

908
01:23:22,530 --> 01:23:25,431
- I'll be back in a bit.
- Where are you going?

909
01:23:26,434 --> 01:23:30,200
I'll be back soon, I just got to..
I got to deal with some stuff.

910
01:23:30,305 --> 01:23:31,863
What's going on?

911
01:23:37,312 --> 01:23:39,974
What if you come home
and I'm not here?

912
01:23:42,217 --> 01:23:44,208
You got some place
you got to be?

913
01:24:59,461 --> 01:25:02,988
Your boss called and he wants
you to call him right away.

914
01:25:06,734 --> 01:25:08,429
Are you in trouble?

915
01:25:13,007 --> 01:25:14,565
They just miss me.

916
01:25:17,178 --> 01:25:18,873
Where are you going?

917
01:25:25,420 --> 01:25:27,354
Something has to change.

918
01:25:29,157 --> 01:25:32,649
- What do you mean?
- I mean that this just isn't working.

919
01:25:33,695 --> 01:25:36,528
- What's not working?
- The life that we have.

920
01:25:37,732 --> 01:25:41,793
It was really bad before Rio
and now it's even worse.

921
01:25:41,903 --> 01:25:45,168
You never tell me anything
that's going on anymore.

922
01:25:45,273 --> 01:25:46,934
I don't understand.

923
01:25:50,044 --> 01:25:51,636
Neither do I.

924
01:25:51,913 --> 01:25:54,347
What was that in
the car yesterday?

925
01:25:57,719 --> 01:25:59,118
I could help.

926
01:26:00,555 --> 01:26:02,352
I don't need any help.

927
01:26:31,085 --> 01:26:34,077
Do you realize that I've
been having an affair?

928
01:26:38,026 --> 01:26:40,187
What's that supposed to mean?

929
01:26:40,828 --> 01:26:43,353
Means I've been
fucking another guy.

930
01:26:45,300 --> 01:26:49,600
Every Thursday, me & your brother, Hank.
We get together and we fuck.

931
01:26:51,406 --> 01:26:53,431
Not only that, he loves me.

932
01:26:55,543 --> 01:26:57,909
And he still finds
me attractive.

933
01:26:59,080 --> 01:27:00,445
All the time.

934
01:27:01,816 --> 01:27:03,579
Not just on vacation.

935
01:27:07,322 --> 01:27:08,448
Hank?

936
01:27:12,727 --> 01:27:14,024
Yeah, Hank.

937
01:27:17,632 --> 01:27:19,827
Aren't you gonna say anything?

938
01:27:24,439 --> 01:27:26,407
Are you gonna get angry?

939
01:27:40,288 --> 01:27:44,019
- Where are you gonna go?
- I was just gonna go to my mother's.

940
01:27:44,826 --> 01:27:46,885
How're you gonna get there?

941
01:27:49,931 --> 01:27:51,796
I was gonna take a cab.

942
01:27:57,605 --> 01:28:00,870
I could really use
some, some money.

943
01:28:07,448 --> 01:28:09,439
I'll go to the bank later.

944
01:28:10,385 --> 01:28:11,443
Here.

945
01:28:41,382 --> 01:28:44,510
Hi, you've reached Gina and Andy.
Leave a message.

946
01:29:53,688 --> 01:29:55,883
Please hang up and
try your call..

947
01:30:12,874 --> 01:30:14,842
Come on.

948
01:31:09,964 --> 01:31:13,730
Last person I ever thought I'd
see again as long as I lived.

949
01:31:13,835 --> 01:31:15,302
Charlie Hanson.

950
01:31:18,239 --> 01:31:20,070
You're still a crook?

951
01:31:20,408 --> 01:31:22,899
You come all this
way to insult me?

952
01:31:25,446 --> 01:31:29,746
Did you hear anything about a holdup
at the Westchester Shopping Mall?

953
01:31:29,851 --> 01:31:32,012
What would I know
about Westchester?

954
01:31:32,119 --> 01:31:36,556
That's just for upstanding
citizens such as yourself.

955
01:31:36,657 --> 01:31:37,783
Have you heard anything?

956
01:31:37,892 --> 01:31:41,293
Why would I hear anything
about anything? I sell diamonds.

957
01:31:41,395 --> 01:31:43,124
- And fence them.
- Never!

958
01:31:43,231 --> 01:31:49,067
Did you hear of a young
guy called Bobby Lasorda?

959
01:31:49,170 --> 01:31:50,831
Wrong tree, Charlie.

960
01:31:51,405 --> 01:31:55,239
A couple of punks shot my
wife in a holdup. She's dead.

961
01:31:57,545 --> 01:31:58,807
I'm sorry.

962
01:31:58,913 --> 01:32:01,177
I don't give a shit about
your little side business,

963
01:32:01,282 --> 01:32:04,308
I don't care about
anything anymore,

964
01:32:04,418 --> 01:32:07,114
except finding the
guy who did this.

965
01:32:07,221 --> 01:32:09,018
Do you know anything?

966
01:32:10,791 --> 01:32:14,591
I remember when Charlie Hanson
started out on the streets.

967
01:32:14,695 --> 01:32:20,031
Young and cocky, good cutter.
A long time ago, Charlie.

968
01:32:21,202 --> 01:32:24,399
You always hated my guts,
you called me a crook,

969
01:32:24,505 --> 01:32:27,133
but you didn't know shit
about how the world works,

970
01:32:27,241 --> 01:32:30,574
or what some people
will do for money.

971
01:32:31,045 --> 01:32:32,273
I guess,

972
01:32:34,215 --> 01:32:36,012
now you know, Charlie.

973
01:32:42,957 --> 01:32:46,620
The world is an evil
place, Charlie.

974
01:32:47,495 --> 01:32:53,229
Some of us make money off of
that, and others get destroyed.

975
01:32:55,169 --> 01:32:57,000
He walked in here,

976
01:32:57,104 --> 01:32:59,800
he looks a little bit
like you, Charlie.

977
01:33:00,107 --> 01:33:04,510
He walked in here and I almost
knew him, right off the bat.

978
01:33:24,932 --> 01:33:26,092
Hello.

979
01:33:27,501 --> 01:33:28,490
It's me.

980
01:33:28,603 --> 01:33:31,731
Andy, Jesus, man,
we got problems.

981
01:33:32,573 --> 01:33:34,268
What do you mean, problems?

982
01:33:34,375 --> 01:33:38,539
Bobby's girlfriend's got
a fucking brother, okay.

983
01:33:38,646 --> 01:33:40,011
And the guy is blackmailing
me, all right.

984
01:33:40,948 --> 01:33:45,317
He said he's gonna go to the cops, all right,
or kill me if I don't pay him $10,000.

985
01:33:45,419 --> 01:33:48,445
All right, all right.

986
01:33:48,556 --> 01:33:51,024
Just stay there, I'll be right
over, I'll figure something out.

987
01:33:51,125 --> 01:33:55,027
- Andy, this guy isn't fucking around.
- All right, I'll figure something out.

988
01:35:26,487 --> 01:35:29,149
Andy, Jake needs to see you.

989
01:35:29,256 --> 01:35:30,951
They're all in the conference
room with the IRS guys.

990
01:35:31,058 --> 01:35:32,047
They're going all the way back

991
01:35:32,159 --> 01:35:34,252
- through your accounts.
- Just fuck 'em, I got to go to my dad's.

992
01:35:34,595 --> 01:35:36,426
I'm gonna have to tell
them you were here.

993
01:36:29,884 --> 01:36:32,079
For God's sake, say something.

994
01:36:39,894 --> 01:36:40,918
Okay.

995
01:36:42,930 --> 01:36:44,591
We're in trouble.

996
01:36:46,667 --> 01:36:50,364
The worst trouble imaginable.
You're aware of that, right?

997
01:36:51,772 --> 01:36:54,570
So, why don't we try and fix it?

998
01:36:56,210 --> 01:37:00,078
There's almost no choice, but you're
gonna have to follow my lead.

999
01:37:00,181 --> 01:37:02,342
No questions, no hesitations.

1000
01:37:02,716 --> 01:37:06,015
I've done that before, all right, and
that's how come I'm standing here,

1001
01:37:06,120 --> 01:37:07,951
with my life going down
the fucking toilet.

1002
01:37:08,055 --> 01:37:09,522
Fuck you, fuck you,
I'll do it alone.

1003
01:37:09,623 --> 01:37:11,887
You can sit here and
wait till you go to jail

1004
01:37:11,992 --> 01:37:13,857
and take it up the ass for the
rest of your fucking life.

1005
01:37:13,961 --> 01:37:16,691
Let's do it already,
what's your idea?

1006
01:37:18,899 --> 01:37:20,890
Sorry, what's your idea?

1007
01:37:27,241 --> 01:37:29,675
What's Bobby's
girlfriend's name?

1008
01:37:30,644 --> 01:37:32,612
Chris. Yeah, Chris.

1009
01:37:32,713 --> 01:37:34,340
Chris.

1010
01:37:34,448 --> 01:37:38,179
Call Chris, tell her to get her
brother over to her apartment.

1011
01:37:38,319 --> 01:37:41,015
- What for?
- We'll meet him.

1012
01:37:41,255 --> 01:37:44,986
He figures we owe him $10,000,
we have to resolve it.

1013
01:37:45,092 --> 01:37:46,889
Resolve it how?

1014
01:37:49,730 --> 01:37:52,426
Play it by ear, see what
happens, maybe we pay him.

1015
01:37:52,533 --> 01:37:55,001
He's never gonna let
us off the hook.

1016
01:37:55,102 --> 01:37:59,198
All right, we're gonna be paying him
back for the rest of our lives.

1017
01:38:01,308 --> 01:38:04,607
Hey, you finally figured out
something for yourself.

1018
01:38:07,681 --> 01:38:10,548
Let's just get the
money, see what happens.

1019
01:38:12,019 --> 01:38:14,283
Where are we gonna get $10,000?

1020
01:38:16,090 --> 01:38:18,388
No, that might be easier.

1021
01:38:23,497 --> 01:38:24,828
Call Chris.

1022
01:38:26,367 --> 01:38:27,493
Taxi!

1023
01:39:27,094 --> 01:39:29,858
Andy, Jesus Christ!
You're gonna kill him.

1024
01:39:31,765 --> 01:39:32,959
Come on.

1025
01:39:35,202 --> 01:39:36,169
Shit.

1026
01:39:56,390 --> 01:39:57,789
Come on.

1027
01:40:00,594 --> 01:40:03,062
Hold the bag. Hold
out the fucking bag!

1028
01:40:04,565 --> 01:40:07,227
Hold it open like this.
Hold it open like that!

1029
01:40:07,334 --> 01:40:09,063
I got it, I got it.

1030
01:40:14,608 --> 01:40:17,076
- Oh, shit, do you want these?
- Just put it in the bag!

1031
01:40:17,177 --> 01:40:18,974
Put it in the bag!

1032
01:40:21,849 --> 01:40:23,316
- Out.
- Got it.

1033
01:40:37,898 --> 01:40:39,695
Oh, my God, Andy.

1034
01:40:39,800 --> 01:40:41,290
- Did you touch anything?
- Did you go crazy?

1035
01:40:41,402 --> 01:40:42,733
- Did you touch anything?
- Are you fucking nuts?

1036
01:40:42,836 --> 01:40:45,771
- Did you touch anything?
- Wait, you didn't have to kill him, all right.

1037
01:40:45,873 --> 01:40:48,706
He's not gonna go to the cops. All right?
He's a drug dealer.

1038
01:40:48,842 --> 01:40:52,073
Yeah, I guess he'll just go to
some other dealers and suppliers

1039
01:40:52,179 --> 01:40:54,773
and that's all we need, is 10
South Americans chasing us

1040
01:40:54,882 --> 01:40:57,908
for the rest of our lives.
Did you touch anything?

1041
01:40:58,018 --> 01:40:59,645
I don't think so.

1042
01:40:59,753 --> 01:41:02,119
- You don't think so?
- I don't think so, no!

1043
01:41:02,222 --> 01:41:05,089
- No, I didn't touch anything!
- Think, God damn it, you think!

1044
01:41:05,192 --> 01:41:07,092
- I don't.. I don't like this, Andy!
- Did you touch anything?

1045
01:41:07,194 --> 01:41:09,560
- I don't like..
- Shut up! Shut up!

1046
01:41:13,100 --> 01:41:15,193
- Did you touch anything?
- No.

1047
01:41:16,303 --> 01:41:17,668
Are we good?

1048
01:41:18,872 --> 01:41:20,066
Let's go.

1049
01:42:21,301 --> 01:42:23,166
You got the money, chico?

1050
01:42:23,270 --> 01:42:25,204
I don't like wasted trips.

1051
01:42:28,542 --> 01:42:30,533
You don't look happy.

1052
01:42:30,644 --> 01:42:32,578
Mind if I call you groucho?

1053
01:42:33,914 --> 01:42:35,506
No, I don't mind.

1054
01:42:41,355 --> 01:42:44,017
- Like what you're seeing?
- Yeah, a lot.

1055
01:42:44,992 --> 01:42:47,460
- Stand up. Stand up!
- All right, all right.

1056
01:42:47,561 --> 01:42:50,587
- Turn around.
- All right, all right, all right.

1057
01:42:53,634 --> 01:42:55,568
So how we gonna do this?

1058
01:42:56,837 --> 01:42:59,738
Gladly pay you the
money, got plenty of it.

1059
01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:02,172
How do we know you're not gonna bleed
us for the next couple of months?

1060
01:43:02,276 --> 01:43:04,676
I just want enough to
take care of Chris.

1061
01:43:04,778 --> 01:43:08,612
That's nice, my brother wouldn't
take care of me like that.

1062
01:43:08,715 --> 01:43:11,946
Hey, what do you say, Chris,
should I trust this guy?

1063
01:43:14,054 --> 01:43:15,578
- Yes.
- Speak up. What?

1064
01:43:15,689 --> 01:43:17,122
Yes.

1065
01:43:17,224 --> 01:43:18,816
I don't think so.

1066
01:43:20,661 --> 01:43:23,425
No, Andy, don't, don't, don't..

1067
01:43:24,765 --> 01:43:27,632
- What did you say?
- No, you can't do that, I won't let you.

1068
01:43:27,734 --> 01:43:29,065
- You won't let me?
- No, no more,

1069
01:43:29,169 --> 01:43:31,569
you kill her, you're
gonna have to kill me.

1070
01:43:31,672 --> 01:43:33,401
Not such a bad idea.

1071
01:43:37,177 --> 01:43:39,372
You know, in fact, it's
a pretty good one.

1072
01:43:48,088 --> 01:43:49,988
You know I know.

1073
01:43:52,192 --> 01:43:53,750
What do you know?

1074
01:43:55,896 --> 01:43:57,056
I know.

1075
01:44:03,103 --> 01:44:04,400
I'm sorry.

1076
01:44:04,972 --> 01:44:06,667
I fucked it all up.

1077
01:44:09,376 --> 01:44:10,707
Just do it.

1078
01:44:11,545 --> 01:44:12,705
Do it.

1079
01:44:14,748 --> 01:44:15,976
Go ahead.

1080
01:44:17,484 --> 01:44:18,644
Come on.

1081
01:44:20,254 --> 01:44:22,279
You'd be doing me a favor.

1082
01:44:25,626 --> 01:44:26,820
Come on.

1083
01:44:41,842 --> 01:44:43,810
Get the hell out of here.

1084
01:44:57,491 --> 01:45:00,085
Get the hell out of here! Go!

1085
01:45:00,193 --> 01:45:01,285
Go!

1086
01:45:14,574 --> 01:45:17,270
Hank! Hank!

1087
01:45:37,197 --> 01:45:39,995
Move out of the way,
move out of the way.

1088
01:45:41,034 --> 01:45:44,401
You'll have to move your vehicle.
Move out of the way.

1089
01:46:48,869 --> 01:46:50,131
Hi, Mr. Hanson.

1090
01:46:50,237 --> 01:46:51,329
Stick your head in.
If he's awake now,

1091
01:46:51,438 --> 01:46:53,963
you can spend a couple
of minutes with him.

1092
01:47:36,416 --> 01:47:37,383
Dad?

1093
01:47:42,355 --> 01:47:44,346
I never meant to hurt her.

1094
01:47:45,192 --> 01:47:46,921
I just needed money.

1095
01:47:50,130 --> 01:47:52,564
There wasn't supposed
to be any gun.

1096
01:47:53,467 --> 01:47:57,563
She wasn't supposed to be in the store.
Everything just went wrong.

1097
01:48:05,579 --> 01:48:07,570
It's okay, Andy.

1098
01:48:15,355 --> 01:48:16,652
It's okay.

1099
01:49:09,843 --> 01:49:13,404
Nurse, the heart monitor
cut out for a second.

1100
01:49:13,513 --> 01:49:17,074
It does that, don't worry. If it
happens again, just press reset.

1101
01:50:45,572 --> 01:50:46,539
Dad.

1102
01:51:42,829 --> 01:51:43,921
Nurse!

1103
01:51:49,736 --> 01:51:52,170
Emergency personnel, code blue.

1104
01:51:52,272 --> 01:51:54,672
Emergency personnel, code blue.

1105
01:52:31,200 --> 01:52:34,200
