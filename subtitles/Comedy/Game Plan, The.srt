2
00:02:56,844 --> 00:03:00,388
How embarrassing. Look at that.

3
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:04,392
If I were with a real guy doing this,
I would've gotten a pedicure.

4
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,143
And a wax.

5
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,105
Oh, shit, that one's worse.

6
00:03:09,273 --> 00:03:12,024
-Sorry I didn't get a pedicure.
-What?

7
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,027
My toes.

8
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:17,280
-I'm sorry.
-I'm not looking at your toes.

9
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:20,491
-I'm looking at your cervix.
-Right.

10
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:23,286
Now I kind of wish
you were looking at my toes.

11
00:03:24,496 --> 00:03:25,913
-All done.
-That's it?

12
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:30,042
We'll elevate your legs for
1 0 minutes and you'll be good to go.

13
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:34,672
First time I hear that ticking clock
and I'm not freaking out.

14
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:38,009
-Good. Just relax.
-I can't. I'm totally freaking out.

15
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:40,052
Come on.
Everything's gonna be great.

16
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,221
I have a feeling that you and...

17
00:03:42,431 --> 00:03:46,726
...CRM-1 014 are gonna
make beautiful babies together.

18
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,439
Yeah. Thank you.

19
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:02,909
Oh, God, I hope this works.

20
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,995
I've wanted this for so long.

21
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:09,916
Maybe this isn't how
I pictured it exactly.

22
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,959
Thought I'd have
a little more support.

23
00:04:12,127 --> 00:04:17,048
-No! You don't want kids. Trust me.
-Easy for you to say. You have four.

24
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:21,302
-And it's awful. They've ruined my life!
-Hi, munchkins.

25
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:22,845
What? No! Go away!

26
00:04:23,013 --> 00:04:25,890
Have you seen my vagina?
I mean, have you?

27
00:04:26,058 --> 00:04:29,393
Because I would show it to you.
I will show it to you just to prove...

28
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:33,397
...that you don't want to have kids.
I will show you my vagina.

29
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:35,566
I don't want to see that.
I want a baby.

30
00:04:35,734 --> 00:04:38,736
I think you're tired of being alone.
Haven't met the right guy.

31
00:04:38,904 --> 00:04:43,491
Not about a guy. I've dated hundreds
of guys over the past five years.

32
00:04:43,659 --> 00:04:45,534
Not one of them's close
to being the one.

33
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:47,328
It's just not happening for me.

34
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:50,706
-Yeah, but doesn't mean that it won't.
-Doesn't mean that it will.

35
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:53,417
Is that my chicken?
What are you doing?

36
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:54,669
Give it back!

37
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:58,798
That is your dinner, not a toy!

38
00:04:59,591 --> 00:05:02,259
I hate them. Do you smell pee?

39
00:05:03,095 --> 00:05:06,180
So, l had to figure it out on my own.

40
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:10,601
I examined every possibility and
arrived at the most logical conclusion.

41
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:12,728
Will you be my baby-daddy?

42
00:05:13,897 --> 00:05:16,983
What? No, I can't be the father.
Are you out of your mind?

43
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,652
What are you talking--?
No. I am in my sexual prime.

44
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:23,823
I have more women to bed before I do
something as idiotic as having a baby.

45
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:26,993
Clive, you're my friend.
Don't you want to help me?

46
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,579
We don't have to have sex.
You don't have to be involved at all.

47
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:33,791
All right? Just give me your sperm.

48
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:39,755
Okay. Okay,
you're feeling lonely, right?

49
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:41,882
Maybe a little dead down there.

50
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:45,344
I get it, I get it. Been a long time
since you've had, you know.

51
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:46,554
Just shut up, okay?

52
00:05:46,722 --> 00:05:48,973
-Just forget it. Forget the whole thing!
-What?

53
00:05:49,141 --> 00:05:51,267
Well, that was a bust.

54
00:05:51,435 --> 00:05:56,063
So I took life by the horns...

55
00:05:56,231 --> 00:06:00,067
...and I did what I had to do.

56
00:06:00,444 --> 00:06:02,028
Yeah.

57
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,364
It's gonna be okay.

58
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,200
I have a plan.

59
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:12,496
Ding.

60
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:19,253
-You don't have to walk like that.
-What? Oh, okay.

61
00:06:19,421 --> 00:06:22,840
By the way, I know an excellent
support group for single moms...

62
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:26,552
-...if you're interested.
-Great. Great.

63
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,014
Maybe we should hug. We might
have just made a baby together.

64
00:06:31,475 --> 00:06:34,351
-Good luck.
-Okay. All right.

65
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:38,939
Hi.

66
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:40,274
-Hi.
-Hi.

67
00:06:52,287 --> 00:06:54,789
-Hi!
-Get away from me!

68
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:01,378
Taxi!

69
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:11,639
Hallelujah!

70
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:15,226
Excuse me. This is my cab.

71
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:18,020
-What, you own it?
-No, but I'm about to rent it.

72
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:22,983
If someone hails a cab and it pulls up,
you can't jump in and say it's yours.

73
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:25,277
-I didn't see you.
-I saw you see me.

74
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:29,740
Sir. Sir, excuse me.
Who saw you first?

75
00:07:33,537 --> 00:07:36,622
Look, maybe you're not
from around here, but there's a code.

76
00:07:36,832 --> 00:07:40,167
-Certain rules that we try to follow.
-Fine! Forget it. I'll get out.

77
00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:43,546
You're not right, but I'm in
a terrific mood and you're ruining it.

78
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:45,422
No, I'll get out.

79
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:49,301
-Now what?
-I don't know. You tell me.

80
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:52,680
-Hey, hey!
-Where's he going? Come back!

81
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:58,727
Well, that was stupid.
Why'd you get out, you stupid-head?

82
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:02,106
You said you were in a great mood
and I was ruining it. I felt bad.

83
00:08:02,274 --> 00:08:05,276
I'm sorry,
did you just call me a stupid-head?

84
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:23,460
How's your great mood now?

85
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:26,213
Please, stop talking to me.

86
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:32,094
So why are you in
such a good mood anyway?

87
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:35,389
Not that it's your business,
but good things are happening to me.

88
00:08:35,557 --> 00:08:37,850
Wow, that's great.
I hope it continues.

89
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:41,437
Thanks.

90
00:08:41,897 --> 00:08:45,566
Well, have a nice life.
And try not to steal any more cabs.

91
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:47,359
Yeah, you do the same.

92
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:52,198
Hey, there's a penny right there.

93
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,450
Why don't you pick it up?
It's good luck.

94
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:56,911
Only if it's heads.

95
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:02,958
Now somebody else
can have good luck. Bye.

96
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:05,169
Bye.

97
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:39,662
Thank you for coming to
Hudson Mutts.

98
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:41,288
Hi, Nutsy!

99
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:43,415
Oh, my God. You're glowing.

100
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,751
-Hello.
-Oh, my God. She's glowing, right?

101
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:47,878
-Tell us everything.
-Not much to tell.

102
00:09:48,046 --> 00:09:50,214
You got shot up with red-headed
freckle sperm.

103
00:09:50,382 --> 00:09:51,632
There's something to tell.

104
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,093
He had red hair and freckles?
Why'd you do that?

105
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:56,220
-Tried to talk her out of it.
-Red pubes.

106
00:09:56,388 --> 00:09:58,514
Never saw his pubes.
It was a vial of semen.

107
00:09:58,682 --> 00:10:00,975
So come on, what happened?

108
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:03,269
I lay down,
put my feet over my head.

109
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:06,188
Five minutes later, it was over.
I barely felt a thing.

110
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:09,400
So basically,
it was like having sex with Clive.

111
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:12,486
-You wish.
-l'll be in the back, legs over my head.

112
00:10:12,654 --> 00:10:14,863
-Red hair and freckles!
-You had your chance!

113
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:19,827
-What?
-I don't know. It's just weird.

114
00:10:19,995 --> 00:10:21,954
Who is this guy
she was with anyway?

115
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:23,706
She wasn't actually with him.

116
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:26,750
Yeah, but I still want to kick his ass.
Is that wrong?

117
00:10:26,918 --> 00:10:28,544
You're stupid.

118
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:54,361
Okay, all right.

119
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:58,198
Welcome to
Single Mothers and Proud.

120
00:10:58,408 --> 00:11:02,995
As the name suggests,
we are all single, mothers...

121
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:05,581
...and proud.

122
00:11:05,749 --> 00:11:07,166
Hey, all right.

123
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:08,917
Okay. Some of us have adopted.

124
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:11,587
Some of us have conceived
with a donor.

125
00:11:11,755 --> 00:11:15,215
Every story is different, but
with the same common denominator.

126
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:19,053
We wanted a child,
and we made it happen on our own.

127
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,888
We sure did. We sure did.

128
00:11:21,056 --> 00:11:26,018
Are you already a single mother
or are you trying to become one?

129
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:28,979
Oh, I was just inseminated
a few days ago.

130
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:33,275
Inseminated. Makes me feel
like a cow or something.

131
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:38,572
Well, we do what we have to do
when we don't have a penis partner.

132
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:41,867
-That's right.
-So let's hear about you.

133
00:11:42,077 --> 00:11:47,164
Oh, okay. Let's see.
Well, l own a pet store.

134
00:11:47,874 --> 00:11:52,878
Yeah. I used to work in the corporate
world, which was great for a while...

135
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:56,256
...but it just didn't feel like the life
that I wanted to live.

136
00:11:56,424 --> 00:12:03,055
So now I'm happy on the work front,
but you know.

137
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:05,974
I don't know.
Even though I have more balance...

138
00:12:06,184 --> 00:12:07,893
...it's personal.

139
00:12:08,103 --> 00:12:11,688
I still haven't found "the one,"
so that's why I'm....

140
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:14,608
Well, the elusive one.

141
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:16,026
-Good luck.
-Right.

142
00:12:16,194 --> 00:12:18,404
If I had a dollar for every time
I heard that.

143
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:21,073
I thought I'd be married with kids
by now...

144
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:24,076
...but that's just not happening...

145
00:12:24,786 --> 00:12:28,580
...so I guess it's time for
my backup plan. So.

146
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:31,792
Well, Zoe, listen.
If you really want a baby...

147
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:35,045
...we here at
Single Mothers and Proud...

148
00:12:36,965 --> 00:12:38,257
...can be your partners.

149
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:42,177
From inception to graduation,
everything in between.

150
00:12:42,345 --> 00:12:43,846
We can be here for you.

151
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,183
Great.

152
00:12:48,351 --> 00:12:49,476
Thank you.

153
00:12:49,644 --> 00:12:52,062
Dakota was born right here.

154
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:54,022
In this very room.

155
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:57,401
-Right where you're sitting, actually.
-Really?

156
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:00,529
Right here?

157
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:03,323
Imagine that. Funny.

158
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:05,617
So how old is your baby now?

159
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:07,870
I'm 3.

160
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:11,790
So cute.

161
00:13:12,876 --> 00:13:14,751
Why do you need a support group?

162
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:17,045
-You're not very supportive.
-What?

163
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:19,173
You just told me that if
I breast-feed...

164
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:22,759
...my girls are gonna wind up
looking like empty tube socks.

165
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:24,970
Hey, I'm just being honest.

166
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:29,433
Don't even get me started on
what childbirth does to your bladder.

167
00:13:29,851 --> 00:13:32,102
What does it do to your bladder?

168
00:13:34,272 --> 00:13:36,940
I think I just peed a little bit.

169
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:41,487
Don't think I'm pregnant anyway.
Doctor says it takes a few tries.

170
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:44,198
Something about frozen sperm
being lazy.

171
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:45,866
Oh, come with me for a minute.

172
00:13:46,034 --> 00:13:49,828
I have to make some muffins for some
bullshit teacher-appreciation day.

173
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:53,248
-You're gonna make muffins?
-Oh, hell, no.

174
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:55,375
But there's a place here
that sells them.

175
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:58,962
I pick out the worst ones
and I pretend I made them.

176
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:01,632
Come on.

177
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,760
Okay, which is the ugliest?

178
00:14:04,928 --> 00:14:07,304
Seems like a lot of trouble
for something trivial.

179
00:14:07,472 --> 00:14:09,181
Welcome to motherhood.

180
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:28,784
-There's that guy.
-What guy?

181
00:14:28,952 --> 00:14:31,787
The one selling cheese. I know him.

182
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:33,497
He's hot.

183
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:39,127
-He sells cheese?
-You sell hamsters.

184
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:43,215
-Can I help you ladies?
-No. We're good, thank you.

185
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:46,760
Like what you see?

186
00:14:47,637 --> 00:14:50,389
-What?
-Just talking about the muffins.

187
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:52,558
-Hey, you.
-Hey.

188
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:58,021
Hi. What a nice surprise.
How did you know l worked here?

189
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,023
I didn't.

190
00:15:00,984 --> 00:15:02,526
Oh, okay.

191
00:15:02,694 --> 00:15:04,611
Did you follow me here?

192
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:06,655
Follow you?

193
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:09,408
To the Farmers' Market?
Are you kidding me?

194
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:13,036
No, we came to buy muffins.
You were here. Tell him.

195
00:15:13,204 --> 00:15:15,914
You better buy something.
You ate all my samples.

196
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:21,420
Well, it's really nice to see you,
but I never got your name. I'm Stan.

197
00:15:21,796 --> 00:15:23,839
-Oh, Zoe.
-Zoe.

198
00:15:24,007 --> 00:15:26,466
I'm Mona. So how do you two
not know each other?

199
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:28,594
-He stole my cab.
-She stole my cab.

200
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:31,722
Okay.

201
00:15:33,683 --> 00:15:35,350
We should go.

202
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:37,811
-We should?
-Yeah, we have that important thing.

203
00:15:37,979 --> 00:15:39,855
Can your thing wait
just a few minutes?

204
00:15:40,023 --> 00:15:41,773
I'll give you a taste of my cheese.

205
00:15:44,819 --> 00:15:46,612
I can rephrase that.

206
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:49,364
Okay. This is our basic chèvre.

207
00:15:49,574 --> 00:15:53,702
Probably our best seller and the
cheese that started it all, as they say.

208
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:57,122
These are our surface-ripened
cheeses. These are fantastic.

209
00:15:57,290 --> 00:16:01,168
And these are the aged
raw-milk cheeses. Now--

210
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,131
This is really boring, isn't it?

211
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:08,008
-No.
-Yes.

212
00:16:08,885 --> 00:16:10,719
This is Louie. He works for me.

213
00:16:11,346 --> 00:16:12,554
-Hi.
-Hi. Zoe.

214
00:16:12,722 --> 00:16:13,764
-Zoe.
-Mona.

215
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:16,433
-Can I give you a sample box?
-Oh, yeah.

216
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:17,976
-I'm okay.
-We're okay.

217
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:20,896
You're not lactose intolerant,
are you? l hate that.

218
00:16:21,064 --> 00:16:23,273
Hey. You're still coming over tonight,
right?

219
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:27,194
Yeah. Yeah.

220
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:30,530
We should go.

221
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,492
-Are you ready?
-I want a sample box.

222
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:36,244
Okay. Well, I gotta go. Bye.

223
00:16:38,081 --> 00:16:43,585
Bye.

224
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,296
-You said free sample box, right?
-Yes.

225
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:47,631
-Free? Okay.
-Absolutely.

226
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:49,675
In that case....

227
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:00,894
Okay, spill it.
Who is he, what does he do...

228
00:17:01,062 --> 00:17:02,979
-...how do we know him?
-Who?

229
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:07,109
Stan from the Farmers' Market.
He's called twice already.

230
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:08,944
I'm gonna kill Mona.

231
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,029
Is he a farmer?

232
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:16,118
-He makes cheese.
-He's a Pilgrim?

233
00:17:16,327 --> 00:17:18,120
Mona said his feta was incredible.

234
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:19,955
That makes so much
more sense now.

235
00:17:20,123 --> 00:17:21,456
Who is this guy?

236
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:23,750
He's nobody. He's just some guy.

237
00:17:23,918 --> 00:17:26,795
-Are you blushing?
-You're totally blushing.

238
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:29,131
Can we calm down,
get ready for the book signing?

239
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:30,382
-No.
-This is exciting.

240
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:31,633
I'm not calming down.

241
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:34,803
He's nobody. And even if
he was somebody, it doesn't matter...

242
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:37,889
...because I don't want
to be with anybody. Okay?

243
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,058
So let's just get back to work.

244
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:44,229
-Finding a relationship is work.
-I don't want a relationship.

245
00:17:45,273 --> 00:17:47,232
Well, it is.

246
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,151
Yo, taxi.

247
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:52,112
So dogs have
an ingrained pack mentality.

248
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,448
If we don't assert leadership
over our dogs...

249
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:58,827
...our dogs are going to show unstable
behaviour or dominant behaviour.

250
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:01,538
In other words, in the dog world...

251
00:18:01,706 --> 00:18:04,875
...who you are is stable or
unstable energy, leader or a follower.

252
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:09,045
So when a dog introduces himself
to another dog, what do they do?

253
00:18:10,673 --> 00:18:13,258
Exactly.
When a human wants to meet a dog:

254
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:16,344
"Oh, my God, he's so--"

255
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:19,848
So I mean, it's like, poor dog,
you know?

256
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:24,811
And so they're interacting based
on energy and also the nose....

257
00:18:24,979 --> 00:18:26,521
Okay. Now this is getting weird.

258
00:18:26,689 --> 00:18:29,483
I know. We keep running into
each other. It's crazy.

259
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,943
So your being here
is just another coincidence?

260
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:34,988
-Oh, no. I love this guy.
-Don't you have someplace...

261
00:18:35,156 --> 00:18:37,073
-...to be tonight?
-Not till later.

262
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:38,408
Do you even have a dog?

263
00:18:38,576 --> 00:18:42,746
No. But I might get one
now that I can "be the pack leader."

264
00:18:42,914 --> 00:18:45,916
The dogs would just shake it.
"Do you want to play again?"

265
00:18:46,501 --> 00:18:49,044
-I'm really busy here.
-You have a boyfriend.

266
00:18:49,212 --> 00:18:50,837
-Just tell me. I can take it.
-No.

267
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:53,131
You just know
you're not interested in me?

268
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:56,176
You're making a big mistake.
I'm very interesting.

269
00:18:57,011 --> 00:18:59,346
I'm just not interested in men
right now, okay?

270
00:18:59,514 --> 00:19:02,682
-Oh, you're gay?
-I'm not gay.

271
00:19:03,226 --> 00:19:04,392
-Quiet.
-Hey, you two.

272
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,186
Would you please take it outside?

273
00:19:06,354 --> 00:19:08,230
-Sorry.
-Okay, sorry about that.

274
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:10,273
-That was awkward.
-Yeah.

275
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:15,278
This is not a good time for me, okay?
I'm going through some changes.

276
00:19:15,446 --> 00:19:16,780
Menopause?

277
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:19,366
Menopause? Seriously?

278
00:19:19,534 --> 00:19:20,784
How old do you think l am?

279
00:19:20,952 --> 00:19:22,327
Let's start over.

280
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:25,288
The more I think about it,
we'd never make it as a couple.

281
00:19:25,456 --> 00:19:27,499
You're too sceptical.
We should be friends.

282
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:30,168
-I have enough friends.
-You can never have too many.

283
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:33,296
-What you doing tonight?
-Getting take-out, going to bed.

284
00:19:33,464 --> 00:19:36,007
Clearly, you don't have
that many friends.

285
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:38,051
Okay, here's my proposition.

286
00:19:38,219 --> 00:19:40,929
Don't freak out.
It requires very little commitment.

287
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:44,683
I'm getting take-out too. Let's walk
together to the same place...

288
00:19:44,851 --> 00:19:48,770
...order and pay for our own respective
meals, and then we'll say goodbye.

289
00:19:48,938 --> 00:19:50,856
Where do you want to go?

290
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:58,905
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

291
00:19:59,073 --> 00:20:02,534
No fair. You chose this place
because it takes, like, two seconds.

292
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:04,995
No, I chose it because it's the best.

293
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:09,165
I want to see you take a bite of that.
I don't believe you're gonna eat it.

294
00:20:10,126 --> 00:20:11,376
Fine.

295
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:17,883
There. Happy now?

296
00:20:18,301 --> 00:20:20,385
You have no idea how good this is.

297
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:23,722
Lived in New York your whole life,
never gone to Gray's Papaya.

298
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:26,933
-What's wrong with you?
-Haven't lived here my whole life.

299
00:20:27,101 --> 00:20:30,770
We moved out of the city
when my parents bought the farm.

300
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:35,859
No, not died. They actually bought
a farm and we moved upstate.

301
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:39,863
They retired to Phoenix five years
ago, and I run the place now.

302
00:20:40,031 --> 00:20:41,823
What about your family?

303
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:44,993
Actually, my parents died
when l was young.

304
00:20:45,161 --> 00:20:47,996
It's just me
and my grandmother now.

305
00:20:48,164 --> 00:20:52,584
-I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
-lt's okay. lt was a long time ago.

306
00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:54,210
Look, I really have to go.

307
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:58,256
All right. But I can't let you
walk home alone...

308
00:20:58,424 --> 00:21:01,468
...because this is a very dangerous
neighbourhood.

309
00:21:08,851 --> 00:21:10,727
What school did you go to?

310
00:21:10,895 --> 00:21:12,395
Well, l kind of dropped out.

311
00:21:12,563 --> 00:21:15,607
I met this Swedish girl
during my semester abroad and....

312
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:19,235
Let me guess.
You fell in love and got married.

313
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:22,948
-And started an inn in Vermont.
-Of course.

314
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:26,451
It lasted like three seconds.
I didn't know how to run an inn.

315
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:30,330
And she didn't know how not to sleep
with everyone who worked there...

316
00:21:30,498 --> 00:21:33,166
...so we got divorced.
Yeah, she took everything.

317
00:21:33,334 --> 00:21:36,753
I had to move back in with
my parents, work myself out of debt...

318
00:21:36,921 --> 00:21:40,256
...and figure out how not to blame
every woman on the planet...

319
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:41,883
...for Ana's whorish ways.

320
00:21:42,051 --> 00:21:45,762
-How's that going?
-Not so good.

321
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:51,184
Okay, I want to know everything.

322
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:53,645
First kiss?

323
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:58,525
Some jerk with a dirt bike
and chapped lips.

324
00:21:58,693 --> 00:21:59,734
You?

325
00:21:59,902 --> 00:22:03,196
Seventh grade. She wore braces
and headgear. It was terrifying.

326
00:22:03,364 --> 00:22:04,781
Ouch.

327
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:08,994
Hey. Look.

328
00:22:10,121 --> 00:22:11,788
-Here's one for you.
-That's weird.

329
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,044
Okay, best kiss?

330
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:21,798
That's a tough one.

331
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:27,012
Because if we weren't just friends,
I'd kiss you right now.

332
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,014
Then I'd be your best kiss.

333
00:22:30,433 --> 00:22:31,766
How do you know?

334
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:35,186
I know.

335
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:49,743
Is someone looking for you?

336
00:22:51,996 --> 00:22:54,205
Yeah. I have to go.

337
00:22:54,999 --> 00:22:57,417
-Okay.
-Okay.

338
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:03,131
-Bye.
-Bye. I'll call you.

339
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:12,974
-You think it was the muffin girl?
-I guess. I don't know.

340
00:23:13,142 --> 00:23:14,809
Why do I even care?

341
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:17,312
You like him!

342
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:20,023
Oh, God. What if I'm pregnant?

343
00:23:20,191 --> 00:23:23,068
-Then it'll work out perfectly.
-What do you mean?

344
00:23:23,277 --> 00:23:26,071
Because if you really like him,
as soon as that happens...

345
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:29,032
...you'll break up with him,
because you're pregnant.

346
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,327
You won't have to put
yourself out there, possibly get hurt.

347
00:23:32,495 --> 00:23:34,079
Hey, that's your dream.

348
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:35,955
Be quiet.

349
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:39,459
Besides, I'm not pregnant.

350
00:23:39,627 --> 00:23:41,795
And I'm okay on my own.

351
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:43,463
Are you gonna see him again?

352
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:48,134
Yeah, I think so.

353
00:24:00,356 --> 00:24:01,564
No.

354
00:24:04,902 --> 00:24:07,112
Not gonna happen, Nutsy.

355
00:24:11,826 --> 00:24:13,243
Hello.

356
00:24:13,786 --> 00:24:15,745
Oh, Stan.

357
00:24:36,142 --> 00:24:37,725
Go away.

358
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:46,359
Stop it! You're making me nervous.

359
00:25:05,713 --> 00:25:08,047
You're early. I'll be a minute, okay?

360
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:11,509
Three to five minutes, actually.

361
00:25:13,721 --> 00:25:17,348
-You want a beer?
-Yeah, sure. You want one?

362
00:25:20,186 --> 00:25:21,477
-l'll let you know.
-Okay.

363
00:25:22,855 --> 00:25:25,648
Oh, my God. Is he okay?

364
00:25:25,816 --> 00:25:29,110
He's fine. Happens all the time.

365
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:31,571
Go.

366
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:37,035
-I'm sorry. Can you give me a minute?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

367
00:25:37,203 --> 00:25:38,870
Okay, good.

368
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:45,126
Damn it, Nuts.

369
00:25:46,754 --> 00:25:49,714
Give me that. Give it to me.

370
00:25:49,882 --> 00:25:51,132
Let go.

371
00:25:52,635 --> 00:25:56,012
Let go right now!

372
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:59,015
-Zoe, everything okay?
-Yeah.

373
00:25:59,225 --> 00:26:01,768
You know, just showing him
who's the pack leader.

374
00:26:08,359 --> 00:26:09,692
You idiot!

375
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:14,948
You better not swallow that thing.
Give it to me. Nutsy.

376
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:17,492
Open. Open.

377
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:21,704
-You look really pretty tonight.
-Thank you.

378
00:26:21,872 --> 00:26:26,292
I mean, you always look really pretty,
but tonight you look especially pretty.

379
00:26:26,794 --> 00:26:29,045
And that dress is--

380
00:26:29,213 --> 00:26:30,546
It's really something.

381
00:26:30,798 --> 00:26:33,216
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

382
00:26:35,177 --> 00:26:38,096
Did you buy a new dress
for our date tonight?

383
00:26:38,264 --> 00:26:41,015
-Don't flatter yourself.
-l'll take that as a yes.

384
00:26:41,183 --> 00:26:44,519
-I guess you'll never know.
-I guess not.

385
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:50,984
-Except you left the price tag on.
-What?

386
00:26:52,194 --> 00:26:53,569
Allow me.

387
00:26:55,781 --> 00:26:57,115
I got it.

388
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:13,923
I've had this dress for a long time.
It's just I haven't worn it yet...

389
00:27:14,091 --> 00:27:16,134
...so that's why the tag was still on.

390
00:27:17,428 --> 00:27:18,928
You're not that special.

391
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:21,931
Really?

392
00:27:49,126 --> 00:27:50,335
Look at this place.

393
00:27:51,128 --> 00:27:53,921
-I don't know what to say.
-Finally.

394
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:57,550
-What's that supposed to mean?
-lt means good. Don't say anything.

395
00:27:57,718 --> 00:28:01,095
You don't have to say anything.
Just come over here, sit down.

396
00:28:01,263 --> 00:28:04,140
-What, you think I talk too much?
-I did not say that.

397
00:28:04,308 --> 00:28:06,559
-What did you say?
-Just you're very quick.

398
00:28:06,727 --> 00:28:09,437
You always have a response
for things, which I like.

399
00:28:09,605 --> 00:28:12,023
But tonight, just, you know,
be surprised.

400
00:28:22,576 --> 00:28:23,659
Surprise.

401
00:28:26,997 --> 00:28:28,498
You're good.

402
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:31,793
You worked for an Internet
company? I don't see that at all.

403
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,587
I was very important.
You would've been impressed.

404
00:28:34,755 --> 00:28:37,423
Really?
How did you get the pet store?

405
00:28:38,384 --> 00:28:40,343
Actually, it was through my dog,
Nuts.

406
00:28:40,511 --> 00:28:43,012
I bought him at this fancy pet store
near my house.

407
00:28:43,222 --> 00:28:46,933
Cutest puppy you have ever seen.
Six months later, he almost dies.

408
00:28:47,101 --> 00:28:49,644
Turns out he was from
one of those puppy mills...

409
00:28:49,812 --> 00:28:52,563
...where dogs are so inbred,
he was kind of falling apart.

410
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:55,441
What did you do?
Did you sue them?

411
00:28:55,609 --> 00:28:57,485
I thought about it. Then I thought:

412
00:28:57,653 --> 00:29:00,405
"What good would that do?
They'll still sell inbred dogs."

413
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:01,614
So I quit my job...

414
00:29:01,782 --> 00:29:05,034
...and I took the stock-option money
over to the pet store...

415
00:29:05,202 --> 00:29:07,078
...and I bought it.

416
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:11,707
I know how to milk a goat.
Does that do anything for you?

417
00:29:13,419 --> 00:29:15,044
No, not really.

418
00:29:16,922 --> 00:29:19,257
Can I ask you a serious question,
Zoe?

419
00:29:19,967 --> 00:29:21,467
What?

420
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:29,517
Did you buy that dress
to wear for me tonight?

421
00:29:43,991 --> 00:29:45,450
I will never tell.

422
00:29:47,453 --> 00:29:49,328
Really? Because...

423
00:29:52,583 --> 00:29:55,626
...I have ways of making you talk.

424
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:11,225
-Let me get that. Let me get that.
-My dress! I got it.

425
00:30:11,435 --> 00:30:14,645
There's a hose over there
behind the fence.

426
00:30:15,981 --> 00:30:19,400
You see it? Get the hose.

427
00:30:34,124 --> 00:30:37,043
-Okay, this is war.
-What? No!

428
00:30:37,211 --> 00:30:39,754
Okay, hand it over. Hand it over!

429
00:30:47,513 --> 00:30:50,139
-lt was mean.
-You weren't even pointing at the fire.

430
00:30:50,307 --> 00:30:52,683
-You just soaked me.
-You were pointing at my face.

431
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:55,019
But I wasn't trying to soak you.
I swear!

432
00:30:55,187 --> 00:30:57,063
Oh, whatever!
I looked into your eyes...

433
00:30:57,231 --> 00:31:00,149
...and I saw you had this crazy look,
like a crazy person.

434
00:31:00,317 --> 00:31:02,693
-That's not true.
-lt is true. You know what else?

435
00:31:02,903 --> 00:31:07,698
I think I owe you another dress. And I
definitely owe you another date.

436
00:31:09,201 --> 00:31:10,409
I'd like that.

437
00:31:11,203 --> 00:31:14,080
Why don't you come to the farm
with me next weekend?

438
00:31:18,168 --> 00:31:19,835
I'll call you.

439
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:21,379
I'll wait by the phone.

440
00:31:38,772 --> 00:31:39,981
What?

441
00:32:18,437 --> 00:32:20,396
Holy shit!

442
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:23,816
-I know.
-Are you sure?

443
00:32:23,984 --> 00:32:25,568
If I'm not, then my dog is.

444
00:32:25,736 --> 00:32:28,404
You're not making any sense.
You're definitely pregnant.

445
00:32:29,114 --> 00:32:32,116
-Congratulations! How are we feeling?
-We're freaking out!

446
00:32:32,284 --> 00:32:34,368
-What she said.
-Why?

447
00:32:34,536 --> 00:32:36,704
We performed an inter-uterine
insemination...

448
00:32:36,872 --> 00:32:38,831
...using sperm that you purchased.

449
00:32:38,999 --> 00:32:41,292
This isn't exactly
what we call an accident.

450
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:45,671
It's just happening so fast.

451
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:49,175
Keep breathing. Pump those arms.

452
00:32:49,343 --> 00:32:51,302
What did you all eat last night?

453
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:54,055
-Hey, Arthur.
-Well, hello, my dear.

454
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:56,057
Oh, no, no, no,
don't get up. It's okay.

455
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:57,516
I can't get up.

456
00:32:57,684 --> 00:33:00,478
-Came to see my lovely fiancée?
-Yes.

457
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:04,774
Oh, she's looking fine today,
let me tell you. Just fine.

458
00:33:05,025 --> 00:33:06,400
-Hi, sweetheart.
-Hey.

459
00:33:06,568 --> 00:33:08,903
-Baby.
-Hey. I need to talk to you.

460
00:33:09,071 --> 00:33:11,489
-Sure.
-Alone.

461
00:33:11,657 --> 00:33:13,115
Shirley.

462
00:33:13,283 --> 00:33:16,410
Don't worry about them.
They can't hear anything anyway.

463
00:33:17,913 --> 00:33:24,168
-I'm pregnant.
-What?

464
00:33:25,337 --> 00:33:27,338
-I'm pregnant.
-I can't hear you, darling.

465
00:33:27,506 --> 00:33:31,634
Oh, Jesus, Judy! She's pregnant.
Turn up your hearing aid.

466
00:33:35,514 --> 00:33:38,432
I'm confused.
You said this is what you wanted.

467
00:33:39,935 --> 00:33:43,437
But this guy, he's special. And now
the whole thing's gonna fall apart.

468
00:33:43,897 --> 00:33:45,773
What makes him so special?

469
00:33:45,941 --> 00:33:51,362
I don't know. He's very real.
And funny.

470
00:33:52,322 --> 00:33:53,406
And different.

471
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:56,992
I like him, Nana.

472
00:33:58,203 --> 00:33:59,412
What should I do?

473
00:34:01,081 --> 00:34:02,289
Zoe.

474
00:34:04,793 --> 00:34:08,045
You always get ahead of yourself.
You barely know him.

475
00:34:08,213 --> 00:34:12,633
Spend some time with him.
See what he's really like.

476
00:34:13,385 --> 00:34:17,263
He could be a total douche bag
and then the whole thing is moot.

477
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:20,391
Yeah. Yeah.

478
00:34:23,812 --> 00:34:26,230
-Maybe he is a douche bag.
-Oh, come on.

479
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:29,859
You think he'd ask you away for
the weekend if he had a girlfriend?

480
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:34,238
There's no way he's dating
that muffin bitch, Zoe. Trust me.

481
00:34:34,406 --> 00:34:37,032
Who can say?
Maybe he's looking to get laid.

482
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,201
Oh, well,
don't have sex with him, okay?

483
00:34:39,369 --> 00:34:41,787
That will really complicate things.

484
00:34:41,955 --> 00:34:43,330
-I know.
-lt'll be hard...

485
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:46,709
...with three times the amount of
blood coursing through your body.

486
00:34:46,877 --> 00:34:49,003
-Excuse me?
-Oh, yeah.

487
00:34:49,421 --> 00:34:52,381
That's why pregnant women
are so horny all the time.

488
00:34:52,549 --> 00:34:55,426
Is that what it is?
I thought it was me.

489
00:34:55,635 --> 00:34:59,805
Oh, no. When I was pregnant,
my whole body was so sensitive...

490
00:34:59,973 --> 00:35:02,016
...I could have an orgasm
sitting on a bus.

491
00:35:02,184 --> 00:35:04,685
-I think I'm gonna be sick.
-Me too.

492
00:35:04,895 --> 00:35:07,021
Why? It's a happy story.

493
00:35:07,773 --> 00:35:10,775
-All right, I'm just gonna go up there...
-Disgusting.

494
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:14,320
...and tell him that I'm pregnant.
Just lay all my cards on the table.

495
00:35:14,488 --> 00:35:16,614
Okay, good.
Just don't lay on the table.

496
00:35:16,782 --> 00:35:19,366
Okay?
Because you cannot have sex.

497
00:35:42,182 --> 00:35:43,808
Don't look at me like that.

498
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:46,227
I know. This is a big mess we're in.

499
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:48,979
I'm gonna fix it.

500
00:35:53,693 --> 00:35:56,529
Shit. Here it is.

501
00:36:43,702 --> 00:36:45,703
Watch out for that tree.

502
00:36:46,288 --> 00:36:48,163
Yeah, thanks.

503
00:36:54,004 --> 00:36:55,921
-Hi.
-Hi.

504
00:36:57,841 --> 00:37:00,259
The tree should not be there.
All I'm gonna say.

505
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:03,220
Whatever, Mrs. Magoo.

506
00:37:04,431 --> 00:37:06,348
-Come on. I'm glad you're here.
-Okay.

507
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:09,685
Me too.

508
00:37:10,103 --> 00:37:11,645
Stan.

509
00:37:12,856 --> 00:37:14,857
There's something I need to tell you.

510
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,944
I'm pregnant.

511
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:23,824
Yes, pregnant.

512
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:32,583
Okay, maybe like:

513
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:37,796
I'm gonna have a baby.

514
00:37:42,385 --> 00:37:44,261
I'm with child.

515
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:49,350
Shit.

516
00:37:49,559 --> 00:37:50,601
Stan.

517
00:37:50,769 --> 00:37:52,811
Stan. Stan.

518
00:37:52,979 --> 00:37:55,314
I've been inseminated.

519
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:58,984
Yes, inseminated.

520
00:38:00,195 --> 00:38:03,155
I'm gonna have a baby!

521
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:12,539
Stan?

522
00:38:30,475 --> 00:38:32,893
Spoon, spoon.

523
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:06,427
Would you like a plate?

524
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:13,267
A napkin, trough?

525
00:39:15,812 --> 00:39:18,772
-These are for you.
-That's so sweet. Thank you.

526
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:19,982
You're welcome.

527
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:21,525
You're good.

528
00:39:23,695 --> 00:39:25,070
Okay.

529
00:39:25,238 --> 00:39:27,656
It's just that stew was so delicious.

530
00:39:27,824 --> 00:39:29,533
I knew you'd like it.

531
00:39:29,701 --> 00:39:32,161
So, what's the next step
for a cheese farmer?

532
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:33,454
Very funny.

533
00:39:34,414 --> 00:39:37,666
I want to start
a sustainable gourmet shop, okay?

534
00:39:37,834 --> 00:39:41,962
Cheese, wine, bread,
prepared foods, but everything local.

535
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:46,759
Nothing from farther than 30 miles.
All based on the Farmers' Markets.

536
00:39:46,926 --> 00:39:48,927
-That's a good idea.
-Thank you very much.

537
00:39:49,554 --> 00:39:53,015
I'm good at ideas.
I'm just not good with follow-through.

538
00:39:53,183 --> 00:39:55,059
I wasn't good at marriage.

539
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:57,895
I wasn't good at running
a bed-and-breakfast.

540
00:39:58,063 --> 00:40:00,439
Thank God we didn't have kids.

541
00:40:01,357 --> 00:40:03,859
-You don't want kids?
-I don't think so.

542
00:40:04,027 --> 00:40:05,486
Well, l don't know.

543
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:09,740
For years, l never thought about
the future. I just lived in the moment.

544
00:40:09,908 --> 00:40:12,117
But maybe I'm different now.

545
00:40:12,327 --> 00:40:17,206
I really want to take the next step.
I really want to move on with my life.

546
00:40:17,373 --> 00:40:19,374
About the future.

547
00:40:20,293 --> 00:40:21,710
-Let's talk about that.
-Okay.

548
00:40:21,878 --> 00:40:25,172
Because the future is now.

549
00:40:26,007 --> 00:40:27,925
-Right?
-Right.

550
00:40:31,721 --> 00:40:33,972
There's something that
I need to tell you.

551
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:35,766
Hold that thought.

552
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:38,227
Come here.

553
00:40:53,118 --> 00:40:55,327
-I want to show you something.
-What is it?

554
00:40:55,495 --> 00:40:57,704
-lt's cheese.
-I can see that.

555
00:40:57,872 --> 00:40:59,832
No, no, no, it's new.

556
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:03,168
I had this idea to use these
two different types of goat's milk...

557
00:41:03,336 --> 00:41:05,921
...to come up with something
really unique.

558
00:41:06,089 --> 00:41:08,590
It's sweet...

559
00:41:08,758 --> 00:41:11,593
...and sassy and complex.

560
00:41:13,638 --> 00:41:15,472
I was inspired.

561
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:19,351
So, what are you saying,
I'm your cheese muse?

562
00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:20,978
Yeah.

563
00:41:32,782 --> 00:41:34,575
You're kind of hard
to read right now.

564
00:41:37,954 --> 00:41:41,165
Well, l really want to kiss you...

565
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:47,588
...but it smells like cheese in here.

566
00:42:02,103 --> 00:42:05,647
We have to take it slow, okay?

567
00:42:06,191 --> 00:42:07,441
We can't have sex.

568
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:11,236
-Fine.
-Okay. Okay.

569
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:18,202
Okay.

570
00:42:37,347 --> 00:42:38,388
Did you just--?

571
00:42:51,236 --> 00:42:53,320
Holy shit!

572
00:42:54,197 --> 00:42:57,199
Is my nose bleeding?
You punched me.

573
00:42:57,367 --> 00:43:00,244
-I'm sorry.
-No. It's okay.

574
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:01,995
It was amazing.

575
00:43:02,163 --> 00:43:03,789
It was like over-the-top amazing.

576
00:43:03,957 --> 00:43:06,959
What was that,
like three or four for you?

577
00:43:07,293 --> 00:43:10,212
Stan. Stan.

578
00:43:12,006 --> 00:43:14,758
There's something I have to tell you.

579
00:43:15,134 --> 00:43:16,510
Okay.

580
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:19,513
What is it?

581
00:43:28,773 --> 00:43:30,607
Zoe?

582
00:43:36,489 --> 00:43:37,781
Why are you crying?

583
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:40,784
I'm pregnant.

584
00:43:42,287 --> 00:43:44,663
I'm pretty sure it doesn't
happen that fast.

585
00:43:44,831 --> 00:43:48,375
No, I know. It's hard to explain.

586
00:43:48,543 --> 00:43:50,210
What are you talking about?

587
00:43:56,217 --> 00:43:57,384
I'm pregnant.

588
00:44:07,312 --> 00:44:08,603
Who's the father?

589
00:44:10,106 --> 00:44:11,273
I don't know.

590
00:44:11,441 --> 00:44:14,443
I mean, I know who it is.
I just don't know his name, exactly.

591
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:16,111
It's a donor from a sperm bank.

592
00:44:16,279 --> 00:44:18,655
Seriously, what the hell
are you talking about?

593
00:44:19,699 --> 00:44:23,827
-When did all this happen?
-Actually, it was the day we met.

594
00:44:23,995 --> 00:44:26,872
Yeah, I didn't think to tell you...

595
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:30,751
...because I didn't think there was any
way that I could be pregnant so fast.

596
00:44:30,918 --> 00:44:32,627
But why?

597
00:44:32,795 --> 00:44:34,421
Because I wanted a baby.

598
00:44:35,131 --> 00:44:38,467
I never met the right guy and
I thought that if I waited any longer...

599
00:44:38,634 --> 00:44:40,427
...I might miss my chance.

600
00:44:40,595 --> 00:44:42,095
All right, we just made love.

601
00:44:42,263 --> 00:44:44,931
You tell me you're pregnant
with some stranger's child.

602
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:47,726
Don't say it like that.
You make it sound dirty.

603
00:44:47,894 --> 00:44:50,896
I wanted a baby and I thought
I had to do it alone.

604
00:44:51,064 --> 00:44:54,358
-lt was before I met you.
-I don't know what to say.

605
00:44:55,276 --> 00:44:56,526
What am I supposed to say:

606
00:44:56,694 --> 00:44:59,196
"Congratulations,
this is terrific news"?

607
00:45:00,615 --> 00:45:03,492
I made this big decision
to do this thing.

608
00:45:03,659 --> 00:45:05,035
And then I met you.

609
00:45:07,372 --> 00:45:09,373
-I'm sorry.
-About what?

610
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:11,666
Getting pregnant
or lying to me about it?

611
00:45:11,834 --> 00:45:14,878
-I didn't lie.
-You didn't tell the truth.

612
00:46:19,444 --> 00:46:22,028
-Where are you going?
-I thought this would be easier.

613
00:46:22,196 --> 00:46:26,116
To just disappear at the crack
of dawn? Don't I get a say?

614
00:46:26,284 --> 00:46:28,160
You said everything last night.

615
00:46:28,327 --> 00:46:29,786
No, I didn't.

616
00:46:29,954 --> 00:46:33,623
You left out the part that you had a
girlfriend. That was pretty convenient.

617
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:35,625
I don't have a girlfriend.

618
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:38,086
That girl from the Farmers' Market.

619
00:46:38,713 --> 00:46:40,755
She's not my girlfriend.

620
00:46:40,923 --> 00:46:43,341
She was,
but that was a few years ago.

621
00:46:48,431 --> 00:46:51,850
Olivia's in my class.
We study together.

622
00:46:53,227 --> 00:46:54,311
Study what?

623
00:46:55,021 --> 00:46:58,482
I'm a student. I'm still in school.
I go at night.

624
00:46:58,691 --> 00:47:02,861
-Why didn't you want to tell me?
-Because it's embarrassing.

625
00:47:03,112 --> 00:47:07,616
You're this incredibly accomplished
person and I didn't even finish college.

626
00:47:07,783 --> 00:47:10,494
I mean, I got this great life...

627
00:47:10,703 --> 00:47:14,039
...but I'm barely passing economics.
You know?

628
00:47:24,175 --> 00:47:27,010
-Where are you going?
-Look, let's not drag this out, okay?

629
00:47:27,178 --> 00:47:29,471
I lied to you, you lied to me.

630
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,264
We both have other plans...

631
00:47:31,432 --> 00:47:34,267
...and being together
is just messing everything up.

632
00:47:34,435 --> 00:47:38,980
We should just go
our separate ways. Goodbye.

633
00:49:32,553 --> 00:49:33,803
So how did you two meet?

634
00:49:34,889 --> 00:49:38,058
We can talk later
in your office or whatever.

635
00:49:38,476 --> 00:49:39,851
Okay.

636
00:49:40,019 --> 00:49:43,188
Well, everything seems
right on track.

637
00:49:43,731 --> 00:49:45,857
A little blood. Quite normal.

638
00:49:46,067 --> 00:49:48,568
You don't have to stay in here
if you don't want.

639
00:49:48,736 --> 00:49:50,403
I'm fine. I'm good.

640
00:49:50,571 --> 00:49:54,824
Now, I'm gonna do an ultrasound.
This is how we view the foetus.

641
00:49:56,869 --> 00:49:58,578
Oh, you rub it on her stomach.

642
00:49:58,746 --> 00:50:00,914
I thought you were gonna put
that huge thing--

643
00:50:01,082 --> 00:50:02,123
In her vagina?

644
00:50:03,668 --> 00:50:07,128
It's too early to go through
the abdomen, you see.

645
00:50:07,296 --> 00:50:09,339
So we have to go through the vagina.

646
00:50:09,507 --> 00:50:12,092
Vagina, vagina, vagina.

647
00:50:12,301 --> 00:50:16,638
Maybe if I say it often enough, you'll
feel a little more comfortable. Vagina.

648
00:50:16,806 --> 00:50:18,473
-lt's not working.
-Okay.

649
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:22,227
Okay, now, Zoe.

650
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:26,439
With a little bit of luck,
we'll see a heartbeat.

651
00:50:28,275 --> 00:50:30,068
That's it? That little thing?

652
00:50:30,820 --> 00:50:34,197
-ls everything okay?
-Everything is just....

653
00:50:36,701 --> 00:50:38,201
What?

654
00:50:40,287 --> 00:50:41,996
I see another heartbeat.

655
00:50:42,289 --> 00:50:43,456
It has two hearts?

656
00:50:43,624 --> 00:50:45,792
No, but you have two babies.

657
00:51:02,685 --> 00:51:04,644
Are you gonna leave now?

658
00:51:04,812 --> 00:51:07,147
Because this is more
than you bargained for.

659
00:51:07,314 --> 00:51:10,567
You know,
it's more than I bargained for.

660
00:51:10,735 --> 00:51:14,195
But just tell me, okay?
So I can be prepared.

661
00:51:14,363 --> 00:51:18,408
I just need to sit here, you know?

662
00:51:19,118 --> 00:51:20,660
-Okay.
-Okay.

663
00:51:24,874 --> 00:51:27,917
-But then are you gonna leave?
-Okay, one kid is a lot.

664
00:51:28,419 --> 00:51:29,878
Two kids is a posse.

665
00:51:30,588 --> 00:51:32,464
I'm just getting used to us
as a couple.

666
00:51:32,631 --> 00:51:34,799
And now all of a sudden
you're having a posse.

667
00:51:35,593 --> 00:51:37,093
Are you ready for a posse?

668
00:52:02,411 --> 00:52:04,829
I don't even know if I like kids.

669
00:52:05,706 --> 00:52:08,708
Hey, beat it, pal. All right?

670
00:52:08,876 --> 00:52:10,668
Look, I don't want to
cause a scene...

671
00:52:10,836 --> 00:52:12,921
...but get your hands out
of your pockets...

672
00:52:13,088 --> 00:52:14,756
...and get the hell out of here.

673
00:52:14,924 --> 00:52:17,717
No, I'm talking to you,
because you're the only pervert...

674
00:52:17,885 --> 00:52:20,220
...with his hands in his pockets
at a playground.

675
00:52:20,387 --> 00:52:23,223
-I'm not a pervert!
-If you don't have kids, get lost.

676
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:24,682
I have kids, okay?

677
00:52:24,892 --> 00:52:27,185
A week ago, I didn't even know
she was pregnant...

678
00:52:27,353 --> 00:52:28,561
...and now she's having twins.

679
00:52:28,729 --> 00:52:33,107
I just saw the ultrasound.
The one that goes inside.

680
00:52:34,485 --> 00:52:36,319
I know what you need.

681
00:52:38,072 --> 00:52:39,155
How did this happen?

682
00:52:51,293 --> 00:52:52,794
-Just take that off.
-This here?

683
00:52:52,962 --> 00:52:54,754
-Yeah.
-Oh, man, I'm dizzy.

684
00:52:54,922 --> 00:52:57,048
I'm sweaty and dizzy.

685
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:01,344
-That's normal, bro.
-ls it? Which one's yours?

686
00:53:02,763 --> 00:53:03,888
-l've got three.
-Three?

687
00:53:04,056 --> 00:53:08,059
Yeah, look. That's Charlie right there,
and that's Roxy.

688
00:53:08,227 --> 00:53:09,561
-See that fellow?
-Yeah.

689
00:53:09,728 --> 00:53:11,271
That's Mack.

690
00:53:12,648 --> 00:53:14,482
He's eating sand.

691
00:53:14,650 --> 00:53:17,610
Yeah. By the time you get
to the third one...

692
00:53:17,778 --> 00:53:19,863
...you don't worry so much
about that stuff.

693
00:53:21,156 --> 00:53:23,741
What's it like, the whole kid thing?

694
00:53:23,909 --> 00:53:25,702
It's great!

695
00:53:28,789 --> 00:53:32,792
Except for the lack of sleep,
free time...

696
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:35,044
...sex with my wife...

697
00:53:35,212 --> 00:53:37,171
...buck-naked Fridays
in the family room.

698
00:53:37,339 --> 00:53:40,300
That's not the answer
I was looking for, man. lt's fine.

699
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:45,305
The best way I can describe it is...

700
00:53:45,472 --> 00:53:48,808
...it's awful, awful, awful...

701
00:53:49,852 --> 00:53:53,563
...and then something incredible
happens.

702
00:53:54,899 --> 00:54:00,987
And then awful, awful, awful.

703
00:54:01,530 --> 00:54:03,573
Then something incredible
happens again.

704
00:54:03,782 --> 00:54:08,494
It's like this all day, every day, man.
I feel like I'm drowning...

705
00:54:08,662 --> 00:54:12,040
...like I'm gasping to get
my old life back.

706
00:54:12,207 --> 00:54:14,876
And then a small moment happens...

707
00:54:16,629 --> 00:54:17,837
...that's so magical...

708
00:54:18,547 --> 00:54:22,759
...so life-affirming
that it makes it all worthwhile.

709
00:54:23,969 --> 00:54:25,845
This will be the best thing
you ever do.

710
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:28,014
Dada!

711
00:54:29,975 --> 00:54:31,559
Hey, son.

712
00:54:32,311 --> 00:54:34,520
I guess this would be that moment,
huh?

713
00:54:34,730 --> 00:54:36,439
Yeah, this would be it.

714
00:54:36,607 --> 00:54:38,608
Hey, what do you have there, son?

715
00:54:39,276 --> 00:54:41,027
Poo-poo.

716
00:54:44,323 --> 00:54:46,366
Well, almost.

717
00:54:47,743 --> 00:54:49,327
Son, is that cat shit?

718
00:54:49,495 --> 00:54:51,329
No.

719
00:54:51,622 --> 00:54:53,498
-That's your shit?
-No.

720
00:54:56,293 --> 00:54:58,044
This ain't even his shit.

721
00:54:59,797 --> 00:55:02,423
Charlie, Roxy,
meet me at the bathroom.

722
00:55:02,591 --> 00:55:05,426
What did I tell you about playing
with other people's shit?

723
00:55:06,095 --> 00:55:08,012
So why are you upset?

724
00:55:08,347 --> 00:55:09,764
It's so lucky.

725
00:55:09,932 --> 00:55:12,976
To get pregnant on the first try
with frozen sperm is rare...

726
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:16,646
...but to get pregnant with twins?
I mean, come on, that is unheard of.

727
00:55:17,439 --> 00:55:20,358
Okay, okay.
When you want to speak, you can.

728
00:55:20,526 --> 00:55:23,236
Does anyone else have anything
in the meantime...

729
00:55:23,404 --> 00:55:24,904
...that they'd like to share?

730
00:55:25,114 --> 00:55:26,990
-Tabitha.
-Yeah, I'm having a hard time.

731
00:55:27,157 --> 00:55:29,909
Luca keeps asking me
why his friends have two parents...

732
00:55:30,077 --> 00:55:31,202
...and he only has one.

733
00:55:31,370 --> 00:55:33,871
I knew this would happen someday.
I wasn't prepared--

734
00:55:34,039 --> 00:55:35,206
-There's this guy.
-What?

735
00:55:35,374 --> 00:55:37,458
His name is Stan, and he's fantastic.

736
00:55:37,626 --> 00:55:38,751
Wasn't I just speaking?

737
00:55:38,919 --> 00:55:40,837
You know how
you never meet somebody?

738
00:55:41,005 --> 00:55:44,090
The kind of guy
who makes you rethink everything.

739
00:55:44,258 --> 00:55:46,217
Like, maybe I can
be a stay-at-home mom.

740
00:55:46,385 --> 00:55:48,845
Maybe I can.
I'll love being barefoot and pregnant.

741
00:55:49,013 --> 00:55:51,931
He can teach me how to make
cheese. We can live off the land.

742
00:55:52,099 --> 00:55:56,269
Zoe, this group
is called Single Mothers and Proud.

743
00:55:56,812 --> 00:55:57,979
I know.

744
00:55:58,522 --> 00:56:01,274
I know, I know. I'm sorry.

745
00:56:01,692 --> 00:56:03,818
I wasn't planning to meet anybody.

746
00:56:03,986 --> 00:56:06,195
It just happened.

747
00:56:06,363 --> 00:56:08,990
And now that I've thrown all my plans
out the window...

748
00:56:09,158 --> 00:56:12,994
...and really fallen for this guy...

749
00:56:14,663 --> 00:56:17,373
...I'm just afraid
that he might not stay.

750
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:21,210
What should I do?

751
00:56:25,507 --> 00:56:26,841
I don't know.

752
00:56:27,468 --> 00:56:31,971
This is wildly outside
my field of expertise.

753
00:56:32,139 --> 00:56:35,767
Yeah, because we're
a single mothers group.

754
00:56:36,226 --> 00:56:40,021
So we don't tend to give advice on
how to get your boyfriend to commit.

755
00:56:40,189 --> 00:56:41,230
Not usually.

756
00:56:41,398 --> 00:56:44,108
Maybe you should join
a different group.

757
00:56:44,693 --> 00:56:45,735
-Ding-dong.
-No.

758
00:56:45,903 --> 00:56:49,197
Okay. We are gonna have to
take a vote on this, Zoe...

759
00:56:49,364 --> 00:56:52,033
...because I think we,
collectively, feel...

760
00:56:52,201 --> 00:56:53,993
...that you are in a very...

761
00:56:54,495 --> 00:56:58,206
...wildly different place
than where we are.

762
00:56:58,373 --> 00:57:00,958
So we are going to take a vote.

763
00:57:02,252 --> 00:57:03,711
Okay.

764
00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:14,597
Taxi!

765
00:57:25,984 --> 00:57:27,235
Hi.

766
00:57:28,695 --> 00:57:30,029
How did you find me?

767
00:57:30,197 --> 00:57:32,365
I called the store.
Said it was an emergency.

768
00:57:32,533 --> 00:57:34,117
What is it?

769
00:57:38,914 --> 00:57:40,456
You're crazy.

770
00:57:42,126 --> 00:57:43,918
I don't expect you to stay.

771
00:57:44,128 --> 00:57:46,796
I don't expect you to expect me
to stay.

772
00:57:47,381 --> 00:57:49,006
What if I want to stay?

773
00:57:49,424 --> 00:57:51,717
Well, then I'd be surprised.

774
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:54,428
And happy.

775
00:57:55,806 --> 00:57:58,266
-I can't promise anything.
-Neither can I.

776
00:57:58,433 --> 00:58:00,184
Okay.

777
00:58:02,896 --> 00:58:04,981
Okay, fine. Give me the hot dog.

778
00:58:13,782 --> 00:58:14,824
Perry and Hudson.

779
00:58:14,992 --> 00:58:17,326
-Feel free to run every red light.
-You got it.

780
00:58:19,163 --> 00:58:21,747
-Here we go.
-Here we go.

781
00:58:27,754 --> 00:58:29,839
This sucks!

782
00:58:30,007 --> 00:58:32,967
Nothing fits me!
Please, just let me wear sweats.

783
00:58:33,135 --> 00:58:35,803
Honey, you can't wear sweats.
This is important.

784
00:58:35,971 --> 00:58:38,097
-l'll get that.
-Wait, let me suck it in.

785
00:58:42,102 --> 00:58:44,228
Have you got a jacket or something?

786
00:58:52,362 --> 00:58:55,239
-Got you. I got you. Are you all right?
-Yes.

787
00:58:58,994 --> 00:59:00,578
I can't.

788
00:59:05,876 --> 00:59:07,335
Oh, watch it.

789
00:59:14,885 --> 00:59:17,011
-I'm gonna throw up.
-What?

790
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:21,182
-Good to see you.
-How are you?

791
00:59:21,350 --> 00:59:24,936
Stan. Oh, you are a prince.
Thanks for coming.

792
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:26,979
Sea urchins?

793
00:59:29,149 --> 00:59:30,524
Excuse me.

794
00:59:40,827 --> 00:59:42,203
-Hi.
-Hi.

795
00:59:48,502 --> 00:59:52,255
I split my dress. And I didn't
want to go. How about that?

796
01:00:15,904 --> 01:00:17,029
What is that thing?

797
01:00:17,197 --> 01:00:19,824
Oh, Mona gave it to me.
It's supposed to help me sleep.

798
01:00:21,743 --> 01:00:22,994
Okay.

799
01:00:27,374 --> 01:00:29,292
-Hold on.
-Okay.

800
01:00:48,020 --> 01:00:49,520
Zoe?

801
01:00:53,775 --> 01:00:55,026
It's been two weeks now...

802
01:00:55,193 --> 01:00:57,987
...and all she ever wants to do
is sleep with that pillow.

803
01:00:58,155 --> 01:01:00,323
The pillow is a bitch.
Totally replacing you?

804
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:03,826
-Completely. She drags it everywhere.
-My wife, she drew eyes on hers.

805
01:01:03,994 --> 01:01:06,037
I make a move in the middle
of the night...

806
01:01:06,204 --> 01:01:08,039
-...the pillow is staring at me.
-Yeah.

807
01:01:08,206 --> 01:01:11,751
-Like, "Bro, l don't think so."
-We used to have sex all the time.

808
01:01:11,918 --> 01:01:14,754
Every day. Now I can't touch her.
I can barely go near her.

809
01:01:14,921 --> 01:01:16,380
She's pregnant. You can't win.

810
01:01:16,548 --> 01:01:18,924
-The only one who wins is the pillow!
-The pillow!

811
01:01:19,092 --> 01:01:22,636
-Screw that pillow, man.
-You might have to. I did once.

812
01:01:24,639 --> 01:01:26,724
We're gonna be fine.

813
01:01:26,892 --> 01:01:29,518
Gonna get through this.
Everything's gonna be fine.

814
01:01:29,686 --> 01:01:32,688
In a year's time, this is just gonna be
a funny memory, right?

815
01:01:32,856 --> 01:01:35,858
That's right. Before you know it,
the kids will be in school...

816
01:01:36,026 --> 01:01:39,987
...and you'll long for the days when
a pillow was your biggest problem.

817
01:01:41,239 --> 01:01:43,407
Must be hard
when they first go off to school.

818
01:01:43,575 --> 01:01:45,368
Little school shoes,
little backpacks.

819
01:01:45,535 --> 01:01:47,745
No, saying goodbye
to the kid is easy.

820
01:01:47,913 --> 01:01:50,706
Saying goodbye to 20 grand,
now, that's hard.

821
01:01:50,874 --> 01:01:53,584
What are you talking about?
What's 20 grand?

822
01:01:54,086 --> 01:01:56,337
And you have twins.

823
01:01:57,297 --> 01:01:58,798
Double-whammy.

824
01:01:59,883 --> 01:02:02,968
That's a whole lot of Parmesan.

825
01:02:03,136 --> 01:02:04,303
Parmesan.

826
01:02:07,808 --> 01:02:10,017
Oh, my God.

827
01:02:10,185 --> 01:02:13,187
All right, this one says,
"most natural nipple."

828
01:02:13,563 --> 01:02:16,023
That looks nothing like my nipples,
Nana.

829
01:02:16,191 --> 01:02:18,192
This one says, "BPA free."

830
01:02:18,360 --> 01:02:21,112
-What's BPA?
-I don't know.

831
01:02:21,279 --> 01:02:23,030
So how do you know
you don't want it?

832
01:02:23,198 --> 01:02:25,908
It's Bisphenol A,
and you do not want it.

833
01:02:26,076 --> 01:02:28,786
If you're gonna use a bottle,
which we do not advocate...

834
01:02:28,954 --> 01:02:31,163
-...because breast is best...
-Better.

835
01:02:31,331 --> 01:02:32,498
...use a glass bottle.

836
01:02:33,125 --> 01:02:35,835
-How are you, honey?
-I'm good.

837
01:02:36,753 --> 01:02:38,379
We missed you at the meetings.

838
01:02:38,547 --> 01:02:40,965
Okay, yes.

839
01:02:41,633 --> 01:02:46,220
I never heard back after the vote,
so I just assumed that I was out.

840
01:02:46,430 --> 01:02:51,434
Oh, no, it was unanimous.
Didn't anyone call you?

841
01:02:51,935 --> 01:02:53,310
No?

842
01:02:54,438 --> 01:02:55,896
-Okay.
-Okay.

843
01:02:56,064 --> 01:02:59,358
Well, this is my Nana,
and this is Arthur, her fiancé.

844
01:02:59,526 --> 01:03:00,734
-Hello.
-Nice to meet you.

845
01:03:00,902 --> 01:03:03,028
-How you doing?
-When are you getting married?

846
01:03:03,196 --> 01:03:06,991
She's kept me waiting for 22 years,
so I'm not holding my breath.

847
01:03:07,159 --> 01:03:10,953
Zoe, can l put you on
the phone tree?

848
01:03:11,121 --> 01:03:13,873
I kind of want the whole group there
when it happens.

849
01:03:15,125 --> 01:03:17,126
Thanks. That means a lot.

850
01:03:17,294 --> 01:03:19,044
Okay. Well, happy shopping.

851
01:03:19,212 --> 01:03:22,590
And check out the strollers on
aisle six, because they're awesome.

852
01:03:22,757 --> 01:03:24,091
-Did you not call her?
-Okay.

853
01:03:24,259 --> 01:03:25,676
-I don't know.
-Okay.

854
01:03:41,318 --> 01:03:44,695
Stan!

855
01:03:44,863 --> 01:03:46,655
-Lookie!
-Zoe?

856
01:03:47,824 --> 01:03:49,283
-Hey.
-What is that?

857
01:03:49,451 --> 01:03:53,829
It's a Twin X Deluxe, the Rolls-Royce
of strollers. Isn't it awesome?

858
01:03:53,997 --> 01:03:55,247
It's big.

859
01:03:55,415 --> 01:03:57,208
Supposed to fit through
most doorways.

860
01:03:57,375 --> 01:04:00,586
I don't think so.
Just let me get it sideways.

861
01:04:02,380 --> 01:04:04,548
-Keep trying.
-lt's gotta have a thing here.

862
01:04:06,593 --> 01:04:08,135
Hang on.

863
01:04:08,970 --> 01:04:10,095
Oh, shit!

864
01:04:10,263 --> 01:04:12,223
-Are you okay?
-lt bit me.

865
01:04:15,602 --> 01:04:17,144
What the hell is going on here?

866
01:04:17,354 --> 01:04:20,022
An outfit to bring the babies home in
from the hospital.

867
01:04:20,190 --> 01:04:21,815
How many babies are you having?

868
01:04:22,025 --> 01:04:25,528
I just got two of everything.
Look, baby Village People.

869
01:04:26,363 --> 01:04:29,448
How much money did you spend?
Where are we gonna put all this?

870
01:04:29,616 --> 01:04:32,618
-Don't worry. It'll be okay.
-I don't see how that's possible.

871
01:04:32,786 --> 01:04:35,287
Haven't even had the babies
and everything's changed.

872
01:04:36,623 --> 01:04:39,625
You know what? There's the door.
If you want to go, you can go.

873
01:04:39,793 --> 01:04:42,169
Stop it. I hate it when you do that.

874
01:04:47,425 --> 01:04:49,760
I know. I'm sorry.

875
01:04:55,183 --> 01:04:56,725
Let me see.

876
01:05:00,855 --> 01:05:02,439
Sorry.

877
01:05:10,824 --> 01:05:13,617
Have you gotten to page 279 yet?

878
01:05:14,244 --> 01:05:17,037
No, I stopped reading
when you tore out one of my pages...

879
01:05:17,205 --> 01:05:19,248
...and used it as a napkin.

880
01:05:19,833 --> 01:05:22,710
Well, it says here that women
in their third trimester...

881
01:05:22,877 --> 01:05:24,628
...experience
hormonal mood swings...

882
01:05:24,796 --> 01:05:29,216
...and their partners just have to be
extra understanding about it.

883
01:05:31,303 --> 01:05:34,263
Are you coming on to me right now?
It's kind of hard to tell.

884
01:05:46,151 --> 01:05:49,153
-What?
-You have chicken in your hair.

885
01:05:49,321 --> 01:05:51,155
-I do?
-Right there, yeah.

886
01:05:51,656 --> 01:05:53,282
Did I get it?

887
01:05:58,413 --> 01:06:00,414
You know what, honey?

888
01:06:03,043 --> 01:06:07,421
I'm sorry, but not tonight, okay?
Okay?

889
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:12,134
Okay.

890
01:06:25,523 --> 01:06:27,900
-Sorry.
-That's okay.

891
01:06:58,723 --> 01:07:01,100
Hey, babe.
Hey. You want some breakfast?

892
01:07:02,727 --> 01:07:04,395
No, thank you.

893
01:07:05,313 --> 01:07:07,773
It's still nighttime. Are you okay?

894
01:07:07,982 --> 01:07:10,943
Yeah, I'm good. I'm good. Do you
know how much preschool is?

895
01:07:11,111 --> 01:07:13,737
Twenty grand. For circle time.

896
01:07:13,905 --> 01:07:17,282
What about college? I think colleges
run about 50 grand right now.

897
01:07:17,450 --> 01:07:20,786
But that's right now, so in 1 8 years,
it'll be double that, at least.

898
01:07:20,954 --> 01:07:22,830
And we have twins,
so double it again.

899
01:07:23,331 --> 01:07:25,874
So, what's that,
like 200 grand a year?

900
01:07:26,042 --> 01:07:28,669
We haven't even bought books
or clothes or shit.

901
01:07:29,546 --> 01:07:31,922
They're probably gonna need
cars at school.

902
01:07:32,090 --> 01:07:35,509
You know I'm gonna be a pushover
and buy them whatever they want.

903
01:07:35,677 --> 01:07:38,387
So, what's that,
like half a million a year?

904
01:07:38,847 --> 01:07:42,099
I don't have half a million a year.
I'm in night school.

905
01:07:42,308 --> 01:07:45,018
Just something I was thinking about.
It's no big deal.

906
01:07:49,983 --> 01:07:52,317
Why don't you come back
to bed, honey?

907
01:07:52,902 --> 01:07:54,570
Okay.

908
01:08:08,376 --> 01:08:10,961
-Did I wake you up?
-No.

909
01:08:18,094 --> 01:08:20,304
We're gonna be okay.

910
01:08:20,472 --> 01:08:22,431
I have money saved.

911
01:08:25,351 --> 01:08:27,519
It's not just about the money.

912
01:08:28,938 --> 01:08:31,607
I'll figure out a way
to make enough money.

913
01:08:31,775 --> 01:08:33,400
What is it, then?

914
01:08:35,945 --> 01:08:37,446
It's just--

915
01:08:38,740 --> 01:08:40,657
I need to know.

916
01:08:42,619 --> 01:08:44,828
Are you still in there?

917
01:08:50,627 --> 01:08:52,795
I'm still here.

918
01:10:00,989 --> 01:10:04,491
Excuse me. Can I help you?

919
01:10:04,659 --> 01:10:06,451
What do you think?

920
01:10:12,166 --> 01:10:13,959
It's a bit overwhelming, huh?

921
01:10:14,127 --> 01:10:17,504
There are so many,
and they're so big.

922
01:10:17,672 --> 01:10:20,132
Well, they have to be big.
Two babies, right?

923
01:10:20,300 --> 01:10:23,677
Yeah, but babies are small.

924
01:10:25,221 --> 01:10:28,056
These are for,
like, giant mutant babies.

925
01:10:28,224 --> 01:10:33,020
You should see some of the babies
that come in here. Total fat-asses.

926
01:10:34,063 --> 01:10:38,734
By the way,
my boyfriend and I do custom work.

927
01:10:39,819 --> 01:10:42,029
We can solve this.

928
01:11:23,738 --> 01:11:25,197
Zoe?

929
01:11:27,951 --> 01:11:29,785
What are you doing?

930
01:11:29,953 --> 01:11:32,704
Nothing. How was your exam?

931
01:11:32,872 --> 01:11:34,790
Shitty. Come on,
what were you doing?

932
01:11:35,625 --> 01:11:37,167
Nothing.

933
01:11:40,129 --> 01:11:42,047
I gained three more pounds
this week.

934
01:11:42,215 --> 01:11:44,091
And I think it went all to my ass.

935
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:48,679
You look great. You always
look great. I missed you today.

936
01:11:48,846 --> 01:11:50,555
I miss my old ass.

937
01:11:50,723 --> 01:11:53,642
You know what's weird?
I never knew your old ass.

938
01:11:53,851 --> 01:11:56,728
It was kind of like this ass,
but way hotter.

939
01:12:07,365 --> 01:12:08,532
-Baby.
-Yeah?

940
01:12:08,700 --> 01:12:10,033
This is my old ass.

941
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:15,539
What?

942
01:12:19,877 --> 01:12:21,753
Why do you have a picture
of your ass?

943
01:12:21,921 --> 01:12:23,964
My college boyfriend took it.

944
01:12:24,674 --> 01:12:27,592
So in all fairness,
it doesn't look exactly like that...

945
01:12:28,219 --> 01:12:30,679
...but it's pretty close. It's held up.

946
01:12:30,847 --> 01:12:33,098
Yeah, it's a nice ass.

947
01:12:34,517 --> 01:12:37,269
Look, this is me
in the seventh grade.

948
01:12:39,313 --> 01:12:42,024
This is me and Nana
at my confirmation.

949
01:12:47,447 --> 01:12:49,865
This is the last picture
I have of my mom.

950
01:12:50,908 --> 01:12:53,618
She lived for a few more years
after this.

951
01:12:53,828 --> 01:12:55,370
But we didn't take any pictures.

952
01:12:55,538 --> 01:12:57,831
She didn't want us
to remember her that way.

953
01:12:58,708 --> 01:13:01,293
I was 8 years old when she died.

954
01:13:03,629 --> 01:13:05,547
I can't imagine.

955
01:13:08,426 --> 01:13:11,678
She had this great laugh.
And really soft hands.

956
01:13:12,346 --> 01:13:15,515
She used to rub my back
before I went to sleep.

957
01:13:18,519 --> 01:13:22,064
It's such a small thing,
but I think about it all the time.

958
01:13:28,905 --> 01:13:31,740
Why don't you ever talk
about your dad?

959
01:13:33,868 --> 01:13:37,037
She was in a coma
for two years after this.

960
01:13:37,205 --> 01:13:39,748
He didn't stick around.

961
01:13:39,916 --> 01:13:42,209
Oh, God, Zoe.

962
01:13:43,252 --> 01:13:44,836
I'm so sorry.

963
01:13:45,004 --> 01:13:46,129
It's no big deal.

964
01:13:47,423 --> 01:13:49,549
It was an important lesson for me.

965
01:13:49,717 --> 01:13:52,385
That's when I realised
that nothing lasts forever.

966
01:13:55,515 --> 01:13:57,682
So now you know everything.

967
01:14:03,815 --> 01:14:05,899
Some things can last forever.

968
01:14:07,693 --> 01:14:09,444
Maybe.

969
01:14:11,531 --> 01:14:13,824
About my exam.

970
01:14:15,076 --> 01:14:17,327
I didn't exactly--

971
01:14:18,621 --> 01:14:20,580
That's weird.

972
01:14:26,879 --> 01:14:30,048
I'm confused. Why'd you say
you'd come in the first place?

973
01:14:30,216 --> 01:14:32,676
It seemed like a good idea
at the time.

974
01:14:33,553 --> 01:14:34,761
-ls that Zoe?
-Zoe!

975
01:14:35,179 --> 01:14:37,722
-Hey.
-lt is so nice of you to come.

976
01:14:37,890 --> 01:14:39,057
Hi.

977
01:14:39,225 --> 01:14:42,894
Yeah, we just wanted to stop by
and say a quick "hi" and good luck.

978
01:14:43,062 --> 01:14:46,690
No, you're staying. You have to stay.
Lori wants us all here for this.

979
01:14:47,108 --> 01:14:49,860
I really want to stay.

980
01:14:51,779 --> 01:14:53,864
She's having a contraction.

981
01:15:04,542 --> 01:15:07,127
Okay. So, what were you saying?

982
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:09,921
This is Stan.

983
01:15:10,089 --> 01:15:13,175
-Of course.
-Hi. Hi.

984
01:15:13,342 --> 01:15:15,802
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

985
01:15:15,970 --> 01:15:17,888
Hey, you two should get in here.

986
01:15:18,055 --> 01:15:19,973
No, this is your special moment...

987
01:15:20,141 --> 01:15:22,434
-...and we should go.
-No. Oh, God, I'm not shy.

988
01:15:22,602 --> 01:15:24,394
Come on, I've been through it before.

989
01:15:24,562 --> 01:15:27,606
I am not shy.
It is really quite beautiful.

990
01:15:37,491 --> 01:15:40,160
How long do we have to stay here?

991
01:15:40,328 --> 01:15:44,080
-Just wait till it starts. We'll sneak out.
-Okay.

992
01:15:48,085 --> 01:15:51,171
Come on, everyone. lt's happening.

993
01:15:51,339 --> 01:15:55,258
Come on.
She's about to get into the water.

994
01:15:57,553 --> 01:15:59,095
The what?

995
01:16:03,476 --> 01:16:06,269
I'm gonna be out here, okay?

996
01:16:09,565 --> 01:16:12,359
Just relax. Breathe.

997
01:16:17,031 --> 01:16:18,365
I know. Isn't it amazing...

998
01:16:18,532 --> 01:16:21,368
...how the human body
can just open up like that?

999
01:16:24,872 --> 01:16:27,582
I'm gonna go get a little air.
I'm feeling a little--

1000
01:16:27,750 --> 01:16:30,210
No, Zoe. Don't you move, Zoe.

1001
01:16:30,378 --> 01:16:31,670
You're my focal point.

1002
01:16:31,837 --> 01:16:34,965
-What?
-Oh, God.

1003
01:16:35,132 --> 01:16:36,800
Push, Lori. Push.

1004
01:16:38,886 --> 01:16:40,679
Holy shit!

1005
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:44,557
You can't leave.
You're her focal point.

1006
01:16:44,725 --> 01:16:46,059
Can't she use somebody else?

1007
01:16:46,227 --> 01:16:48,687
She's in labour.
You can't argue with her now.

1008
01:16:48,896 --> 01:16:51,273
Someone grab her legs.
Lift them up. Lift them up.

1009
01:16:51,482 --> 01:16:54,818
-Push. That's it, push.
-Breathe.

1010
01:16:58,030 --> 01:17:00,156
Jesus, what is that?

1011
01:17:00,324 --> 01:17:03,827
Perfectly natural.
Sometimes the bowels just release.

1012
01:17:03,995 --> 01:17:07,455
-Ridley, if you could.
-Okay, okay, Lori.

1013
01:17:09,709 --> 01:17:13,128
No, Zoe! Don't you move!
You are my focal point.

1014
01:17:13,296 --> 01:17:15,130
What does that even mean?

1015
01:17:15,298 --> 01:17:17,841
I need to turn over!
I need to turn over, please!

1016
01:17:18,009 --> 01:17:21,011
-We are here for you, sister!
-I need to turn over.

1017
01:17:24,265 --> 01:17:26,933
We are all pushing with you!

1018
01:17:32,398 --> 01:17:33,940
Here comes the head!

1019
01:17:34,483 --> 01:17:38,236
-Get me a mirror! I want to see it!
-No! You don't!

1020
01:17:38,404 --> 01:17:41,489
-Goddamn it, Zoe, don't move!
-I thought you wanted a mirror.

1021
01:17:41,657 --> 01:17:43,074
Stan, the mirror!

1022
01:17:43,784 --> 01:17:45,118
-What?
-The mirror!

1023
01:17:45,536 --> 01:17:46,661
What mirror?

1024
01:17:46,829 --> 01:17:48,913
-Get the mirror! For the love of God!
-Stan!

1025
01:17:49,123 --> 01:17:51,458
-Stan, get the mirror!
-Get the mirror!

1026
01:17:57,214 --> 01:18:00,592
-Hi, I'm Stan. I'm sorry.
-Give me the mirror. Nobody cares.

1027
01:18:00,801 --> 01:18:03,762
-Okay.
-No. No.

1028
01:18:03,929 --> 01:18:07,515
-Look at all that hair.
-That's not the baby's hair.

1029
01:18:08,059 --> 01:18:10,935
One last push!

1030
01:18:35,169 --> 01:18:37,837
Everyone says it's so beautiful.

1031
01:18:39,256 --> 01:18:41,633
I thought it was terrifying.

1032
01:18:42,468 --> 01:18:44,552
I don't ever want to see that again.

1033
01:18:46,806 --> 01:18:49,015
But you want to see ours, right?

1034
01:18:50,601 --> 01:18:53,269
I don't know, baby. It was just--

1035
01:18:53,437 --> 01:18:55,230
I shouldn't have seen that.

1036
01:19:02,947 --> 01:19:05,990
Hey, I was just coming by
to see if you were okay.

1037
01:19:06,158 --> 01:19:08,410
I was worried about you
after the exam.

1038
01:19:08,577 --> 01:19:11,871
-What happened with your exam?
-I was trying to tell you last night.

1039
01:19:16,585 --> 01:19:19,671
-What happened?
-I walked out of the exam.

1040
01:19:19,839 --> 01:19:22,048
-Why?
-I'm quitting school.

1041
01:19:22,216 --> 01:19:25,176
I can't believe you're pregnant.

1042
01:19:25,678 --> 01:19:27,011
Why are you quitting school?

1043
01:19:27,179 --> 01:19:29,806
Because if l stay in school,
I can only work part-time.

1044
01:19:29,974 --> 01:19:33,101
If I work part-time, I can't afford
our expenses. I need to work.

1045
01:19:33,269 --> 01:19:36,521
I had no idea it was this serious.
You're having a baby?

1046
01:19:36,689 --> 01:19:38,773
I didn't know
you'd been together that long.

1047
01:19:38,941 --> 01:19:41,818
Well, yeah, they're not mine,
but yes, we're having a baby.

1048
01:19:41,986 --> 01:19:44,446
We're having twins, actually.

1049
01:19:45,072 --> 01:19:47,782
-What do you mean, "Not mine"?
-Didn't mean it like that.

1050
01:19:48,409 --> 01:19:50,368
-Why would you say that?
-I'm sorry.

1051
01:19:50,536 --> 01:19:52,203
I'm not exactly thinking straight.

1052
01:19:52,371 --> 01:19:55,165
I've been up all night watching Orca
give birth.

1053
01:19:56,208 --> 01:19:58,126
-I am such an idiot.
-No, Zoe.

1054
01:19:58,294 --> 01:20:00,712
Oh, God, l am so stupid.

1055
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:03,631
This is not about money...

1056
01:20:03,799 --> 01:20:05,717
...or that you can't afford kids.

1057
01:20:05,885 --> 01:20:08,261
You don't want this.
That's the problem.

1058
01:20:08,429 --> 01:20:10,305
He always told me
he didn't want kids.

1059
01:20:10,473 --> 01:20:11,598
Why are you still here?

1060
01:20:12,308 --> 01:20:14,684
-Okay.
-That's it, isn't it?

1061
01:20:14,852 --> 01:20:18,605
Really? After everything we've been
through, you think I don't want kids?

1062
01:20:18,772 --> 01:20:21,357
-That's what you just said.
-lt's what you just heard.

1063
01:20:21,525 --> 01:20:22,734
There's a big difference.

1064
01:20:24,570 --> 01:20:26,738
I don't think you're ready for this.

1065
01:20:27,281 --> 01:20:28,740
Now that it's all happening...

1066
01:20:28,908 --> 01:20:30,950
...now you've seen
a woman push a baby out...

1067
01:20:31,118 --> 01:20:33,870
...now it's all too real for you.
And you're scared.

1068
01:20:34,038 --> 01:20:37,373
Damn right, I'm scared. Yeah.

1069
01:20:37,541 --> 01:20:39,709
-Aren't you scared?
-Know what I'm scared of?

1070
01:20:39,877 --> 01:20:41,794
I'm scared
I'm gonna have these babies...

1071
01:20:41,962 --> 01:20:43,630
...and then
you're gonna walk away.

1072
01:20:43,797 --> 01:20:46,508
You're gonna say, "They're
not mine," and just walk away.

1073
01:20:46,675 --> 01:20:48,676
You look for some hint
that I'm leaving...

1074
01:20:48,844 --> 01:20:51,095
...no matter how many times
I tell you I'm not.

1075
01:20:51,263 --> 01:20:54,265
I don't know what else to do.
What else am I supposed to do?

1076
01:20:59,146 --> 01:21:00,188
Nothing.

1077
01:21:03,567 --> 01:21:05,360
So, what are you saying?

1078
01:21:07,029 --> 01:21:08,947
-Just go now.
-I don't want to go.

1079
01:21:09,114 --> 01:21:12,158
-Go.
-This is crazy, Zoe. It's crazy.

1080
01:21:13,744 --> 01:21:16,037
If you don't go, I'll go.

1081
01:21:29,468 --> 01:21:33,054
You know what? Just so you know
when you do the autopsy here...

1082
01:21:33,222 --> 01:21:36,808
...you better realise you have no one
to blame but yourself.

1083
01:21:47,444 --> 01:21:49,112
You had to come along, didn't you?

1084
01:21:50,239 --> 01:21:52,198
I was fine with my plan.

1085
01:21:52,408 --> 01:21:54,534
Totally fine with it.

1086
01:22:52,509 --> 01:22:53,801
You've lost your mind.

1087
01:22:53,969 --> 01:22:55,136
Just give me a boost.

1088
01:22:55,304 --> 01:22:57,722
If you think you are getting
into this Dumpster--

1089
01:22:57,890 --> 01:23:01,142
I need that pillow, okay?
I can't sleep.

1090
01:23:01,310 --> 01:23:03,478
I will never sleep again
without that pillow.

1091
01:23:03,646 --> 01:23:05,855
Well, go to his house.

1092
01:23:06,023 --> 01:23:08,524
Tell him you're sorry.
Then you'll be able to sleep.

1093
01:23:08,692 --> 01:23:11,235
This has nothing to do with
that stupid pillow.

1094
01:23:11,403 --> 01:23:14,989
I'm not going to his house, okay?
He walked away from me.

1095
01:23:15,157 --> 01:23:16,324
You made him walk away.

1096
01:23:16,492 --> 01:23:18,159
What do you know?
You weren't there.

1097
01:23:18,327 --> 01:23:20,203
I've known you for 30 years.

1098
01:23:20,371 --> 01:23:22,830
I know that you would never
see this through.

1099
01:23:22,998 --> 01:23:25,208
I know that you don't trust people.

1100
01:23:25,376 --> 01:23:27,502
You and your grandmother,
crazy-pants.

1101
01:23:27,670 --> 01:23:29,837
She's been engaged to Arthur
for how long now?

1102
01:23:30,005 --> 01:23:31,422
She's never gonna marry him.

1103
01:23:31,590 --> 01:23:34,008
Just like you were never gonna
stay with Stan.

1104
01:23:34,176 --> 01:23:35,343
Okay, Mona.

1105
01:23:35,511 --> 01:23:37,845
I mean,
no wonder you got a sperm donor.

1106
01:23:38,013 --> 01:23:41,599
He's the perfect boyfriend.
He'll never let you down.

1107
01:23:48,190 --> 01:23:52,068
You know, I used a sperm donor
because I wanted a baby.

1108
01:23:53,654 --> 01:23:56,197
Because I wanted a family.

1109
01:23:58,325 --> 01:24:01,411
Because Nana's not gonna
live forever...

1110
01:24:02,121 --> 01:24:04,330
...and then it'll just be me.

1111
01:24:05,749 --> 01:24:10,712
Look, just go home. Okay?
I don't need you here.

1112
01:24:10,879 --> 01:24:12,463
I need my pillow.

1113
01:24:23,851 --> 01:24:25,893
I'm sorry.

1114
01:24:26,061 --> 01:24:28,187
That was too far.

1115
01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:32,400
Yeah. That was too far.

1116
01:24:34,319 --> 01:24:36,404
But you know I'm right.

1117
01:24:39,032 --> 01:24:41,075
Stop talking.

1118
01:24:41,243 --> 01:24:45,246
My pillow doesn't talk.
It just lies there and shuts up.

1119
01:24:57,426 --> 01:24:59,093
Don't beg, Nuts.

1120
01:25:00,554 --> 01:25:03,014
My God, you are stubborn.

1121
01:25:03,223 --> 01:25:05,308
Knock, knock.

1122
01:25:05,476 --> 01:25:07,101
Who's ready to celebrate?

1123
01:25:07,269 --> 01:25:09,020
Oh, Mona, I'm so glad you're here...

1124
01:25:09,188 --> 01:25:12,106
...because now
I can tell both of you together.

1125
01:25:12,983 --> 01:25:14,192
I'm getting married.

1126
01:25:14,568 --> 01:25:15,610
-What?
-What?

1127
01:25:15,778 --> 01:25:19,238
Next weekend.
We finally decided to do it.

1128
01:25:21,033 --> 01:25:22,909
Oh, my God.

1129
01:25:24,620 --> 01:25:28,748
It finally hit me.
This man loves me, and I love him.

1130
01:25:30,375 --> 01:25:32,084
What the hell am I waiting for?

1131
01:25:33,545 --> 01:25:35,838
Oh, I have you to thank for it, Zoe.

1132
01:25:36,006 --> 01:25:40,218
Just seeing you and Stan together,
how happy you are.

1133
01:25:40,385 --> 01:25:43,221
You know, the way you've just thrown
caution to the wind...

1134
01:25:43,388 --> 01:25:45,389
...and decided to go for it.

1135
01:25:45,557 --> 01:25:47,558
I want some of that too.

1136
01:25:50,562 --> 01:25:52,021
What?

1137
01:25:53,482 --> 01:25:54,982
Stan and I broke up.

1138
01:25:57,694 --> 01:26:01,072
-He said the babies weren't his.
-He didn't mean to say it.

1139
01:26:01,240 --> 01:26:03,950
-Tell her the whole story.
-He said it.

1140
01:26:04,117 --> 01:26:07,119
If he said it, he thinks it.
If he thinks it, then he feels it.

1141
01:26:07,287 --> 01:26:09,539
And if he feels it,
what choice do l have?

1142
01:26:09,706 --> 01:26:12,291
Zoe, you know that's not true.

1143
01:26:12,459 --> 01:26:15,586
You're just looking for another way
to back out.

1144
01:26:15,754 --> 01:26:17,672
-Thank you.
-I'm not gonna do this.

1145
01:26:17,881 --> 01:26:21,884
This man has chosen to be with you
and raise your kids as his own.

1146
01:26:22,094 --> 01:26:27,431
You're just gonna throw that all away
for some stupid word choice?

1147
01:27:08,765 --> 01:27:12,476
-Look at you.
-Oh, look at you.

1148
01:27:21,194 --> 01:27:22,737
I'm worried about you.

1149
01:27:22,946 --> 01:27:25,281
No, don't worry.

1150
01:27:26,241 --> 01:27:29,994
I'm great. I'm great.

1151
01:27:30,162 --> 01:27:31,579
I'm just emotional.

1152
01:27:32,039 --> 01:27:33,956
Come on,
let me just finish your makeup.

1153
01:27:34,124 --> 01:27:36,834
Honey, you don't always have
to be so strong.

1154
01:27:37,002 --> 01:27:40,588
I know you learned it from me, but it's
no good. What does it get you?

1155
01:27:40,797 --> 01:27:44,592
It means that I take care of myself,
just like you always did.

1156
01:27:44,760 --> 01:27:46,886
No, Arthur takes care of me.

1157
01:27:47,054 --> 01:27:50,890
He's been taking care of me for
22 years. I just didn't want to admit it.

1158
01:27:51,058 --> 01:27:55,186
Zoe, stop pushing people away.

1159
01:27:56,146 --> 01:27:59,190
-I don't want to talk about this, okay?
-Listen to me.

1160
01:27:59,399 --> 01:28:02,151
Zoe, you will never have
a healthy relationship...

1161
01:28:02,319 --> 01:28:04,820
...with Stan or any man if you don't.

1162
01:28:05,489 --> 01:28:08,991
You have to learn to trust people.

1163
01:28:20,879 --> 01:28:22,505
Okay?

1164
01:28:31,014 --> 01:28:32,056
What is that?

1165
01:28:32,224 --> 01:28:36,435
It's your custom stroller,
the Twin X Torpedo.

1166
01:28:38,480 --> 01:28:39,689
I didn't order this.

1167
01:28:39,856 --> 01:28:41,607
Your husband did.
Or your boyfriend.

1168
01:28:41,817 --> 01:28:44,735
I don't know exactly
what your relationship is.

1169
01:28:44,903 --> 01:28:47,863
Stan? When did he do that?

1170
01:28:48,031 --> 01:28:49,949
About a month ago.

1171
01:28:51,827 --> 01:28:55,079
You don't like it. Shit.
We worked really hard on this one.

1172
01:28:58,834 --> 01:29:00,376
He wasn't gonna leave, was he?

1173
01:29:08,593 --> 01:29:11,137
I'm not really sure
what's happening here.

1174
01:29:11,304 --> 01:29:13,556
Oh, God. We gotta go get him.

1175
01:29:13,724 --> 01:29:15,933
What? I'm getting married in
20 minutes.

1176
01:29:16,101 --> 01:29:21,939
-Weddings never start on time.
-We can't be late. He's 93 years old.

1177
01:29:28,905 --> 01:29:30,364
Stop it.

1178
01:29:30,532 --> 01:29:32,116
Pick up.

1179
01:29:32,284 --> 01:29:34,285
He has to pick up.

1180
01:29:35,871 --> 01:29:39,248
I'm gonna hurl that thing
into the fucking holy water.

1181
01:30:16,578 --> 01:30:19,121
Is this new? "The Zoe?"

1182
01:30:19,706 --> 01:30:21,665
Yeah, it's the first week
it's been out.

1183
01:30:21,833 --> 01:30:23,667
Can I have a sample? What's it like?

1184
01:30:23,877 --> 01:30:28,506
It's stubborn, overly suspicious
and distrustful of men.

1185
01:30:33,887 --> 01:30:37,139
-This song is taking forever.
-This song's never gonna be over.

1186
01:30:49,611 --> 01:30:54,532
What time is it, Shadybrook?
That's right. It's conga time.

1187
01:30:56,034 --> 01:30:59,161
Everybody, get out there
and shake those titanium hips.

1188
01:31:00,664 --> 01:31:02,998
-Conga.
-Conga time.

1189
01:31:03,166 --> 01:31:04,959
I need to talk to you
for two seconds.

1190
01:31:05,127 --> 01:31:07,419
-We really gotta go. Come on.
-We have to go.

1191
01:31:19,850 --> 01:31:21,183
Please, get me out of here.

1192
01:31:21,351 --> 01:31:23,936
I can't find any exit signs
behind the purple flowers.

1193
01:31:24,104 --> 01:31:26,313
Who knew the conga was
this much fun?

1194
01:31:31,653 --> 01:31:33,362
I have rhythm all of a sudden.

1195
01:31:37,159 --> 01:31:38,701
Oh, shit.

1196
01:31:39,953 --> 01:31:41,078
Why is the floor wet?

1197
01:31:41,246 --> 01:31:45,499
-Damn it, not again. No, not me.
-lt wasn't me.

1198
01:31:45,667 --> 01:31:47,001
-Not me.
-Nope.

1199
01:31:47,169 --> 01:31:49,587
I think my water just broke.

1200
01:31:51,381 --> 01:31:52,840
Baby time!

1201
01:32:02,434 --> 01:32:03,684
Stop it!

1202
01:32:03,852 --> 01:32:06,604
What can we do for you, darling?

1203
01:32:06,771 --> 01:32:08,647
This dress is tight.

1204
01:32:08,815 --> 01:32:11,275
I can do it. If you want to let me.
Grab the strap.

1205
01:32:12,444 --> 01:32:14,820
-Fingernail.
-Can we make a pit stop?

1206
01:32:29,461 --> 01:32:30,669
You can't drive in here!

1207
01:32:30,837 --> 01:32:33,255
Okay. Move it. Out of the way.
Lady with a baby.

1208
01:32:36,760 --> 01:32:38,510
-What's going on?
-Your muffins suck!

1209
01:32:38,678 --> 01:32:40,679
-I'm going out of my mind.
-What are you doing?

1210
01:32:40,847 --> 01:32:43,933
I'm trying to call you and
doing the conga. My dress is falling.

1211
01:32:44,100 --> 01:32:47,269
When they say labour's painful,
they're not kidding. Really hurts.

1212
01:32:47,437 --> 01:32:51,065
-You're in labour?
-But the stroller came. It's so beautiful.

1213
01:32:51,233 --> 01:32:54,401
Oh, God! That hurts.

1214
01:32:54,569 --> 01:32:56,570
-Why didn't you pick up your phone?
-When?

1215
01:32:56,738 --> 01:32:59,531
I called you a hundred times.
I wanted you at the wedding.

1216
01:32:59,699 --> 01:33:01,533
-What wedding?
-lt was so beautiful.

1217
01:33:01,701 --> 01:33:02,910
And then it wasn't.

1218
01:33:03,078 --> 01:33:06,413
People slipping everywhere.
Oh, God, l hope nobody got hurt.

1219
01:33:06,581 --> 01:33:09,041
-You're not making any sense.
-No, that's just it.

1220
01:33:09,251 --> 01:33:11,752
Everything makes sense.

1221
01:33:12,587 --> 01:33:17,383
All of a sudden,
everything is just so crystal clear.

1222
01:33:17,550 --> 01:33:19,301
And the thing that's the clearest...

1223
01:33:19,469 --> 01:33:24,390
...is that l am so madly, deeply,
and completely in love with you.

1224
01:33:25,267 --> 01:33:28,602
I can't imagine spending
another minute apart.

1225
01:33:37,279 --> 01:33:38,487
Stan.

1226
01:33:39,781 --> 01:33:41,365
Stan?

1227
01:33:42,617 --> 01:33:45,536
Zoe, after all this time,
you come in here and you expect--

1228
01:33:49,040 --> 01:33:51,208
I gotta go to the hospital. I gotta go.

1229
01:33:51,376 --> 01:33:54,753
-Zoe.
-Let's go. Move it! Get the lead out.

1230
01:33:54,921 --> 01:33:58,632
-Zoe, wait up! Zoe, wait.
-Let's go, let's go, let's go.

1231
01:33:59,175 --> 01:34:03,012
Listen. How do I know when things get
tough, you won't just run away again?

1232
01:34:03,179 --> 01:34:07,766
I can't handle it. You broke my heart.
You completely destroyed me.

1233
01:34:07,934 --> 01:34:11,645
You destroyed me too! It's not like
this has been easy for me!

1234
01:34:11,813 --> 01:34:13,605
Son of a bitch!

1235
01:34:13,773 --> 01:34:15,858
Just breathe through it.
It's gonna be okay.

1236
01:34:16,026 --> 01:34:18,027
Don't you tell me it's gonna be okay!

1237
01:34:18,194 --> 01:34:21,071
You don't know it's gonna be okay.
It hurts. I'm scared.

1238
01:34:21,239 --> 01:34:22,448
It is gonna be okay!

1239
01:34:22,615 --> 01:34:25,242
-Refrain from yelling at the patient.
-I'm not yelling!

1240
01:34:25,410 --> 01:34:28,037
-I'm getting her to see my point!
-Sounds like yelling.

1241
01:34:28,204 --> 01:34:30,789
What will it take for you to believe
I'm here forever?

1242
01:34:30,957 --> 01:34:32,583
You had to see a stupid stroller?

1243
01:34:32,751 --> 01:34:35,627
I've been to every doctor's
appointment with you.

1244
01:34:35,795 --> 01:34:37,421
I picked out names with you.

1245
01:34:39,924 --> 01:34:43,886
I saved this
from the very first day we met.

1246
01:34:44,095 --> 01:34:46,805
It's the one that was tails-up.
You flipped it to heads.

1247
01:34:46,973 --> 01:34:48,724
I've kept it this whole time.

1248
01:34:51,895 --> 01:34:54,521
And it's brought me
the most incredible luck.

1249
01:34:56,983 --> 01:34:58,567
I can't believe you kept that.

1250
01:34:59,569 --> 01:35:01,695
What about the fact that,
like it or not...

1251
01:35:01,863 --> 01:35:04,239
...I will be here holding your hand
through this?

1252
01:35:05,533 --> 01:35:09,203
What about the fact that I'm gonna be
here when these babies are born?

1253
01:35:09,746 --> 01:35:12,289
Because I love their mommy.

1254
01:35:12,457 --> 01:35:15,709
And what I want more
than anything else in the world...

1255
01:35:17,629 --> 01:35:19,546
...is to be their daddy.

1256
01:35:24,928 --> 01:35:28,680
But you have to promise me
that from now on...

1257
01:35:28,848 --> 01:35:31,725
...you'll believe me when I say I'm in.

1258
01:35:31,893 --> 01:35:34,478
And I'm not going anywhere.

1259
01:35:37,816 --> 01:35:39,942
Can you do that?

1260
01:35:46,116 --> 01:35:47,866
Can you?

1261
01:35:54,749 --> 01:35:55,791
Yes.

1262
01:36:09,848 --> 01:36:10,889
Okay.

1263
01:36:11,057 --> 01:36:14,309
-All right, now push. Time to push. Go.
-Okay.

1264
01:36:14,936 --> 01:36:16,812
Breathe, breathe.

1265
01:36:17,814 --> 01:36:19,440
Breathe.

1266
01:36:25,280 --> 01:36:27,072
"Remember my three rules.

1267
01:36:27,240 --> 01:36:29,741
No touch, no talk
and no eye contact...

1268
01:36:29,909 --> 01:36:32,786
...while the dog's nose is busy
analysing our energy...

1269
01:36:32,954 --> 01:36:35,581
...and all the different scents
in our body.

1270
01:36:35,748 --> 01:36:38,792
This sniffing can last
from three seconds to a minute.

1271
01:36:38,960 --> 01:36:40,961
It's important not to interrupt
the dog...

1272
01:36:41,129 --> 01:36:43,797
...while she's intent
on accomplishing this ritual."

1273
01:36:45,049 --> 01:36:46,717
You know, one day...

1274
01:36:46,885 --> 01:36:50,304
...I'm gonna tell you girls the story
of your mommy and me.

1275
01:36:50,472 --> 01:36:52,806
Cesar should write a book
about that one.

1276
01:36:53,433 --> 01:36:56,018
Talk about a bestseller.

1277
01:36:56,227 --> 01:36:57,811
Come here.

1278
01:37:01,566 --> 01:37:03,775
That's nice.

1279
01:37:11,993 --> 01:37:13,035
Come here.

1280
01:37:15,205 --> 01:37:18,749
It was a battle,
but they finally fell asleep.

1281
01:37:20,668 --> 01:37:22,002
Penny had a poop and then--

1282
01:37:22,170 --> 01:37:25,923
Don't talk about Penny's poop
when I'm about to kiss you.

1283
01:37:26,090 --> 01:37:27,508
Okay.

1284
01:37:48,780 --> 01:37:50,197
It's perfect.

1285
01:37:50,406 --> 01:37:51,907
You know what the best part is?

1286
01:37:53,284 --> 01:37:55,452
You can stop in for lunch
every single day.

1287
01:37:57,372 --> 01:38:00,999
-All right. You're here.
-Speech. Speech.

1288
01:38:01,709 --> 01:38:03,669
Okay, thank you.

1289
01:38:06,005 --> 01:38:07,256
Thank you all for coming.

1290
01:38:07,465 --> 01:38:10,759
This has been a dream for me
for a long time.

1291
01:38:13,555 --> 01:38:17,266
And I need to thank one person
for giving me the courage to do it.

1292
01:38:18,560 --> 01:38:21,228
-To Zoe.
-Zoe!

1293
01:38:21,396 --> 01:38:24,565
From the moment you stole my cab...

1294
01:38:24,899 --> 01:38:27,609
...from the day you dissed me
at the Farmers' Market...

1295
01:38:27,777 --> 01:38:32,489
...I have been totally
and completely under your spell.

1296
01:38:33,575 --> 01:38:34,950
I love you.

1297
01:38:35,451 --> 01:38:38,036
And you've made me
the happiest man alive.

1298
01:38:38,204 --> 01:38:39,454
It was my cab.

1299
01:38:41,874 --> 01:38:43,375
Come over here for a minute.

1300
01:38:43,543 --> 01:38:46,712
-Give me that.
-What?

1301
01:38:48,131 --> 01:38:51,675
Since we do everything backwards
and in hyperspeed...

1302
01:38:51,843 --> 01:38:53,510
...I was wondering if we could do...

1303
01:38:53,678 --> 01:38:56,138
...what naturally follows
having twins together.

1304
01:38:58,057 --> 01:38:59,182
Oh, my....

1305
01:38:59,392 --> 01:39:01,435
Holy shit!

1306
01:39:02,770 --> 01:39:04,146
Will you marry me?

1307
01:39:07,275 --> 01:39:08,859
Say yes.

1308
01:39:13,531 --> 01:39:14,865
Yes.

1309
01:39:31,382 --> 01:39:34,593
-I can't believe it.
-I know.

1310
01:39:35,720 --> 01:39:39,097
-Did we really just get engaged?
-Yes, we did.

1311
01:39:40,433 --> 01:39:42,809
Soon you will be my wife.

1312
01:39:50,109 --> 01:40:01,161
Stan.

1313
01:40:17,136 --> 01:40:19,971
-Action.
-What?

1314
01:40:37,699 --> 01:40:41,243
Dakota was born right here.
Right where you're sitting, actually.

1315
01:40:41,452 --> 01:40:43,286
How did you do that here
in this chair?

1316
01:40:43,454 --> 01:40:45,580
The seat comes up.

1317
01:40:48,710 --> 01:40:52,212
-What do you have in your hand?
-Daddy, poo-poo.

1318
01:40:56,134 --> 01:40:59,261
What a good girl. You're okay.
Tuck, get up there. Go on.

1319
01:40:59,429 --> 01:41:02,848
Go on. Go on. Go on.

1320
01:41:06,060 --> 01:41:08,812
Now, wait a minute!
Just one second!

1321
01:41:09,021 --> 01:41:11,565
When did you eat corn?
Is this cat shit?

1322
01:41:11,733 --> 01:41:13,233
No.

1323
01:41:14,152 --> 01:41:16,945
We don't even know
what kind of shit it is.

1324
01:41:21,659 --> 01:41:24,369
Go on, go on. Good, good, good.
Go on, go on, go on.

1325
01:41:25,830 --> 01:41:29,416
Take one. Take five. Take ten.
Fifteen. Twenty-four.

1326
01:41:29,625 --> 01:41:32,335
-There. Happy now?
-You know what goes in those things?

1327
01:41:32,837 --> 01:41:34,880
-Oh, my God.
-Awesome.

1328
01:41:35,381 --> 01:41:38,675
Yeah, do that. That would be nice.
Oh, God.

1329
01:41:38,885 --> 01:41:43,346
Breast to face. There is
no better bond that could be made.

1330
01:41:43,514 --> 01:41:45,432
Breast to face.

1331
01:41:45,641 --> 01:41:48,894
Buck-naked Fridays in the family
room. Buck-naked Wednesdays.

1332
01:41:49,061 --> 01:41:51,855
Buck-naked Friday while the maid
cleans your living room.

1333
01:41:52,023 --> 01:41:54,357
Buck-naked. Buck-naked. Naked.

1334
01:41:54,525 --> 01:41:56,151
Oh, God. Oh, God.

1335
01:42:01,741 --> 01:42:04,576
Perfectly natural.
Sometimes the bowels just release.

1336
01:42:04,744 --> 01:42:05,786
My mother is dead.

1337
01:42:05,953 --> 01:42:10,123
If she was here, she would probably
let me feed from her teat.

1338
01:42:15,838 --> 01:42:19,883
Get the mirror, Stan!
I will rip your throat out!

1339
01:42:25,640 --> 01:42:28,099
Oh, no. Oh, no.

1340
01:42:34,023 --> 01:42:35,982
Not tonight, okay?

1341
01:42:38,027 --> 01:42:39,361
Okay.

1342
01:42:44,909 --> 01:42:47,160
-And cut.
-Food in my hair.
