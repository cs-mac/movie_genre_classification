1
00:01:24,924 --> 00:01:26,844
Oh, shit.

2
00:01:46,564 --> 00:01:47,644
You just got Wolfed.

3
00:01:48,524 --> 00:01:50,324
- What?
- That is an official trademark...

4
00:01:50,524 --> 00:01:52,204
...that I am getting registered.

5
00:01:52,404 --> 00:01:55,244
It's a lot of stuff you gotta do,
hoops you gotta jump through.

6
00:01:55,444 --> 00:01:56,604
Gotta get on the Internet.

7
00:01:56,804 --> 00:02:00,804
Gotta go to some stupid-ass website
where you register a catch phrase.

8
00:02:01,004 --> 00:02:04,204
I wanted "Bam,"
but Emeril had taken it.

9
00:02:05,644 --> 00:02:07,684
I'm rambling, man.
Get up, man. Get up, man.

10
00:02:11,044 --> 00:02:12,284
Is the contender ready?

11
00:02:12,484 --> 00:02:14,804
- Ready.
- Is the gladiator ready?

12
00:02:16,884 --> 00:02:19,204
Three, two, one.

13
00:02:19,644 --> 00:02:21,164
Things are heating up for the Wolf.

14
00:02:21,724 --> 00:02:23,484
I just opened a Target in Reseda...

15
00:02:24,164 --> 00:02:26,764
...and my own brand of BBQ sauce.

16
00:02:27,204 --> 00:02:32,364
I'm calling it Wolf's BBQ Sauce,
available in regular and chipotle.

17
00:02:33,764 --> 00:02:35,884
You still going?
You still want more of this, man?

18
00:02:36,084 --> 00:02:38,004
I learned that in Oriental land.

19
00:02:38,204 --> 00:02:40,964
Whoa, yeah. U.S. A!

20
00:02:45,844 --> 00:02:48,644
They're so small anyway, from steroids.

21
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:12,684
A saber-tooth.

22
00:03:15,844 --> 00:03:17,204
Amy Winehouse?

23
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:23,404
Piss off.

24
00:03:23,604 --> 00:03:26,444
You don't wanna mess with
a bitch straight out of rehab.

25
00:03:27,204 --> 00:03:32,364
Listen, like the dinosaurs
being destroyed by the Ice Age...

26
00:03:32,564 --> 00:03:35,844
...you, too, will soon be extinct.

27
00:03:36,004 --> 00:03:37,204
When?

28
00:03:37,404 --> 00:03:40,164
- How much time do we have?
- Bloody hell.

29
00:03:40,644 --> 00:03:43,284
Just calm down.
Do you know you're speaking so fast...

30
00:03:43,484 --> 00:03:46,724
...I can't even hear, mate?
You're making my head hurt.

31
00:03:46,884 --> 00:03:48,724
Or maybe that was
the gasoline I drank.

32
00:03:48,924 --> 00:03:53,564
Oh, my God, it was good.
Oh, God, I love drinking gasoline.

33
00:03:53,764 --> 00:03:55,924
It's excellent for the vocal cords.

34
00:03:56,124 --> 00:03:57,644
That's my little secret.

35
00:03:57,844 --> 00:04:00,044
- You're welcome.
- How much time do we have?

36
00:04:01,044 --> 00:04:02,684
Let me see.

37
00:04:02,884 --> 00:04:03,964
Hang on a bit.

38
00:04:05,404 --> 00:04:06,404
There we go.

39
00:04:07,404 --> 00:04:09,604
All right, let's have a look-see.

40
00:04:12,244 --> 00:04:13,764
Everyone's on Facebook.

41
00:04:13,964 --> 00:04:15,844
It says...

42
00:04:17,044 --> 00:04:22,724
...that the end of the world
will be August 29th, 28.

43
00:04:26,084 --> 00:04:27,124
Oh, God.

44
00:04:30,084 --> 00:04:31,804
Bottoms up.

45
00:05:17,284 --> 00:05:18,764
Sick.

46
00:05:19,404 --> 00:05:22,484
Mark my words, leather boy.

47
00:05:22,844 --> 00:05:24,564
Cave dweller.

48
00:05:24,764 --> 00:05:27,244
Beaver hunter.

49
00:05:29,004 --> 00:05:33,604
Your doom lies with this.

50
00:05:36,204 --> 00:05:39,564
- The crystal skull.
- That's right. Did your nibblies go tight?

51
00:05:39,764 --> 00:05:42,164
Yeah, they did. Just went up
inside you, didn't they?

52
00:05:50,924 --> 00:05:52,004
Oh, boy.

53
00:05:58,284 --> 00:06:01,084
I knew I shouldn't have
taken all those Ambien.

54
00:06:10,084 --> 00:06:13,764
Amy. Wake up, baby.
I just had the weirdest dream.

55
00:06:14,404 --> 00:06:15,804
Amy.

56
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:17,444
What? What the...?

57
00:06:17,644 --> 00:06:20,884
Flava-Flav! Yeah, boy!

58
00:06:21,084 --> 00:06:23,284
I've been giving your girl
the flavor of love.

59
00:06:23,484 --> 00:06:26,884
She's been sucking
my clock all night long.

60
00:06:27,084 --> 00:06:28,564
Get the hell out of here, Flava!

61
00:06:29,364 --> 00:06:31,564
I'm Flava-Flav!

62
00:06:35,324 --> 00:06:37,564
- What is that about?
- What?

63
00:06:37,764 --> 00:06:39,924
You said you didn't
wanna be in a relationship.

64
00:06:40,804 --> 00:06:43,284
I know, but Flava?

65
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:46,164
Will...

66
00:06:47,844 --> 00:06:49,644
...I wanna take it to the next level.

67
00:06:54,724 --> 00:06:55,844
I love you.

68
00:06:57,564 --> 00:06:59,404
I like you too.

69
00:07:01,764 --> 00:07:03,564
Oh, man.

70
00:07:04,844 --> 00:07:06,804
Look, you don't understand.

71
00:07:07,004 --> 00:07:09,324
I think the world is coming to an end.

72
00:07:10,324 --> 00:07:12,444
That's a way of saying
you have commitment issues.

73
00:07:14,324 --> 00:07:17,644
Unbelievable. Come on, Jojo.

74
00:07:19,677 --> 00:07:20,717
You're taking Jojo?

75
00:07:22,157 --> 00:07:23,117
Goodbye, Will.

76
00:07:25,517 --> 00:07:27,517
Are you still coming
to my Sweet 16 party?

77
00:07:28,077 --> 00:07:29,477
You're 25.

78
00:07:29,677 --> 00:07:32,037
- I never had one.
- Grow up.

79
00:07:57,997 --> 00:07:59,277
Yeah.

80
00:08:01,837 --> 00:08:04,597
- Hey.
- Yeah.

81
00:08:22,397 --> 00:08:24,757
Amy, you came.

82
00:08:38,437 --> 00:08:39,837
Come on.

83
00:08:40,637 --> 00:08:42,157
Oh, hey, Will.

84
00:08:42,357 --> 00:08:44,477
- Happy Sweet 16.
- Thanks.

85
00:08:45,037 --> 00:08:47,477
Take a look at these.

86
00:08:47,677 --> 00:08:49,117
Oh, God.

87
00:08:51,797 --> 00:08:55,237
Hey, Will. It's your buddy, Dr. Phil.

88
00:08:58,637 --> 00:09:01,437
Hey, let me show you
why my frat brothers...

89
00:09:01,637 --> 00:09:04,397
...used to call me Dr. Phil-You-Up.

90
00:09:04,597 --> 00:09:06,517
Oh, hey, baby.

91
00:09:11,357 --> 00:09:13,917
Dyke. Come back here, I like it rough.

92
00:09:14,717 --> 00:09:17,397
Hey, Will, where's that
girlfriend of yours, Amy?

93
00:09:17,597 --> 00:09:19,437
Don't let her get away.

94
00:09:19,637 --> 00:09:23,477
She's a real quality girl,
a real keeper, like that one.

95
00:09:23,677 --> 00:09:25,317
Hey, come on back here, you whore.

96
00:09:25,837 --> 00:09:27,317
Thanks.

97
00:09:28,957 --> 00:09:30,477
Yo!

98
00:09:30,917 --> 00:09:34,437
Let's prank his ass. He passed out.

99
00:09:43,437 --> 00:09:44,637
He's sleeping like a baby.

100
00:09:45,197 --> 00:09:47,837
We can put his hands in warm water.

101
00:09:49,277 --> 00:09:50,437
Or I have a better idea.

102
00:09:50,637 --> 00:09:53,237
- Call it.
- Tails.

103
00:09:55,917 --> 00:09:56,877
It is tails.

104
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:10,797
Punch.

105
00:10:14,357 --> 00:10:15,877
What's up, baby?

106
00:10:16,477 --> 00:10:18,317
Those guys are trying
to steal our booze.

107
00:10:18,517 --> 00:10:20,157
- What?
- We gotta get the alcohol...

108
00:10:20,357 --> 00:10:23,397
...so we can get the girls drunk
so we can finally get laid.

109
00:10:23,597 --> 00:10:24,877
I am McLover.

110
00:10:25,077 --> 00:10:27,237
- Yeah, I know.
- I am McLover.

111
00:10:27,437 --> 00:10:30,437
- Stop saying that.
- I am McLover.

112
00:10:30,637 --> 00:10:32,277
God, you are such a douche.

113
00:10:32,477 --> 00:10:34,677
Yeah, fake ID, what?

114
00:10:35,197 --> 00:10:36,997
Just get the booze.

115
00:10:37,197 --> 00:10:39,197
Nobody tries to steal my Goldschläger.

116
00:10:39,397 --> 00:10:41,397
Shoot the target.

117
00:10:43,997 --> 00:10:46,997
Lisa, how am I supposed to do that?
I don't even have a clear shot.

118
00:10:56,117 --> 00:10:58,517
- Curve the bullet.
- Say what?

119
00:10:59,157 --> 00:11:02,717
You can control the bullet
to go wherever you want.

120
00:11:07,877 --> 00:11:09,917
Don't tell him what to do. He's my man.

121
00:11:10,117 --> 00:11:12,117
Back off, bitch.
You don't want none of me.

122
00:11:17,317 --> 00:11:18,757
Shit.

123
00:11:20,077 --> 00:11:21,157
Get off of me.

124
00:11:29,517 --> 00:11:31,237
Come on, bitch.

125
00:11:46,837 --> 00:11:47,877
Take that, bitch.

126
00:11:54,157 --> 00:11:55,197
How do you like that?

127
00:12:00,757 --> 00:12:03,517
Pretty little thing.
Oh, look at you laying there.

128
00:12:03,717 --> 00:12:07,117
I should kiss you. Give me a kiss, baby.

129
00:12:23,397 --> 00:12:25,117
Left foot, yellow.

130
00:12:26,317 --> 00:12:27,677
Calvin?

131
00:12:27,877 --> 00:12:29,477
Calvin.

132
00:12:29,677 --> 00:12:32,517
- Are you gonna curve the bullet or what?
- Hello?

133
00:12:33,117 --> 00:12:35,437
Yeah. Yeah, right, right.

134
00:12:39,191 --> 00:12:42,131
There's a medical term
for what you do to me: Horny.

135
00:12:44,765 --> 00:12:47,325
- Damn.
- Sorry, Phil.

136
00:12:51,925 --> 00:12:54,805
Shit. I can... I can do this.

137
00:13:00,805 --> 00:13:02,525
- Shit. Hurry up.
- Dude.

138
00:13:03,645 --> 00:13:05,725
Just curve the bullet.

139
00:13:05,925 --> 00:13:08,005
I know you have the power.

140
00:13:25,045 --> 00:13:27,925
Fucking hurry up. Hurry up.

141
00:13:29,445 --> 00:13:30,805
Nice shot, asshole.

142
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:41,525
<i>Juney, why won't you
Have an abortion?</i>

143
00:13:41,725 --> 00:13:44,685
<i>You're not exactly part of
The Christian Coalition</i>

144
00:13:44,885 --> 00:13:49,005
<i>I could just grab a wire hanger
And do it myself</i>

145
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:54,125
<i>Like Jamie Lynn Spears
I'm keeping this baby</i>

146
00:13:54,325 --> 00:13:57,325
<i>And, look, stud
You are no George Clooney</i>

147
00:13:57,525 --> 00:14:01,965
<i>In fact, I just sold the baby
To the highest bidder on eBay</i>

148
00:14:06,685 --> 00:14:09,685
<i>You're a sarcastic teen
Who talks like she's 30...</i>

149
00:14:24,245 --> 00:14:26,365
- Think Amy's coming tonight?
- Man, I don't know.

150
00:14:26,565 --> 00:14:28,525
That's your girlfriend.

151
00:14:28,725 --> 00:14:30,205
Actually, we broke up.

152
00:14:30,405 --> 00:14:32,645
Oh, you want some new booty.

153
00:14:32,845 --> 00:14:34,005
- A little Asian freak.
- No...

154
00:14:34,205 --> 00:14:36,485
<i>A little "One Night in Bangkok,"
a little sake-sake.</i>

155
00:14:36,685 --> 00:14:39,485
<i>I saw Memoirs of a Geisha.
I know that shit goes on.</i>

156
00:14:39,685 --> 00:14:41,565
I'm in love with her.

157
00:14:41,765 --> 00:14:43,765
Then what your dumb ass
break up with her for?

158
00:14:43,965 --> 00:14:45,645
It never would've worked out.

159
00:14:45,845 --> 00:14:48,005
It's better to end it
than to end up hurting her.

160
00:14:48,205 --> 00:14:50,765
You know what?
You got commitment issues, dog.

161
00:14:50,965 --> 00:14:53,885
Well, I didn't exactly have
the best example growing up.

162
00:14:54,085 --> 00:14:56,365
I never even knew my dad.
He split when I was young.

163
00:14:58,445 --> 00:15:00,485
That's your girl right there.

164
00:15:03,965 --> 00:15:05,125
Who's that dude she with?

165
00:15:05,325 --> 00:15:08,285
She started dating some
Calvin Klein underwear model.

166
00:15:12,605 --> 00:15:15,365
Forget about her, man.
I got something that'll cheer you up.

167
00:15:19,165 --> 00:15:22,045
Dude, what is up
with the marching band?

168
00:15:22,245 --> 00:15:24,925
What better way to celebrate
your super-duper Sweet 16...

169
00:15:25,525 --> 00:15:27,045
...than with a high school musical?

170
00:15:35,605 --> 00:15:39,445
<i>Tonight, tonight
We're gonna get real crunk</i>

171
00:15:39,645 --> 00:15:43,125
<i>Tonight, tonight,
A bum's peeing in the punch</i>

172
00:15:48,245 --> 00:15:51,845
<i>Hello, my friends
You're all at my party</i>

173
00:15:52,045 --> 00:15:55,885
<i>It's so good to see all of you</i>

174
00:15:56,085 --> 00:15:59,965
<i>My ex-girl, Amy
And my main man, Calvin</i>

175
00:16:00,165 --> 00:16:03,925
<i>And the priest that molested me too</i>

176
00:16:04,085 --> 00:16:07,645
<i>That reminds me
Of the time I was in college</i>

177
00:16:07,845 --> 00:16:10,285
<i>I was experimenting</i>

178
00:16:11,885 --> 00:16:15,405
<i>Hooking up with a hot
Foreign-exchange student</i>

179
00:16:15,605 --> 00:16:19,365
<i>I think his name was Hop Sing</i>

180
00:16:19,925 --> 00:16:23,525
<i>We'll all be friends forever</i>

181
00:16:23,725 --> 00:16:27,685
<i>Unless a random disaster
Destroys the city</i>

182
00:16:27,885 --> 00:16:31,485
<i>We'll all be friends forever</i>

183
00:16:31,685 --> 00:16:36,365
<i>Because if that happened
It'd be kind of shitty</i>

184
00:16:37,325 --> 00:16:39,325
<i>One, two, three, four</i>

185
00:16:39,845 --> 00:16:43,405
<i>After we split
I took the break-up real hard</i>

186
00:16:43,605 --> 00:16:47,565
<i>- I started foolin' around
- Foolin' around</i>

187
00:16:47,765 --> 00:16:51,445
<i>I did a black dude
I thought he was Kanye</i>

188
00:16:51,645 --> 00:16:55,205
<i>And the Jonas Brothers all got down</i>

189
00:16:55,405 --> 00:16:59,165
<i>Now that you're split
I'll get her hooked on the reefer</i>

190
00:16:59,365 --> 00:17:03,525
<i>Yeah, I'll start pimping her out</i>

191
00:17:03,725 --> 00:17:06,085
- Wait, what?
- Hey, hey, now.

192
00:17:06,485 --> 00:17:09,605
<i>Snoop Dogg's got nothin' on this playa</i>

193
00:17:09,805 --> 00:17:14,445
<i>I'll get the first prize at the Playa's Ball</i>

194
00:17:14,805 --> 00:17:17,445
<i>Hey, hey, man, whoa!</i>

195
00:17:17,645 --> 00:17:20,845
<i>Yeah, it's going on and on
We can do it all day long</i>

196
00:17:21,045 --> 00:17:24,045
<i>It's the new phenomenon, whoa!</i>

197
00:17:24,245 --> 00:17:27,965
<i>Yeah, it's going on and on
It's the new phenomenon</i>

<i>We'll all be friends forever</i>

201
00:17:40,725 --> 00:17:45,365
<i>Because if that happened
It'd be kind of shitty</i>

<i>One, two, three, four</i>

203
00:17:48,805 --> 00:17:51,405
J.T.'s here. J. T!

204
00:17:54,805 --> 00:17:56,245
<i>Oh, babe</i>

205
00:17:57,885 --> 00:18:00,485
<i>If I sang you a melody</i>

206
00:18:00,685 --> 00:18:04,965
<i>Would you toss me
Your panties?</i>

207
00:18:11,565 --> 00:18:13,085
<i>I don't mean to be a boastful man</i>

208
00:18:13,285 --> 00:18:15,245
<i>But I've done groupies
in my touring van</i>

209
00:18:15,445 --> 00:18:17,205
<i>Britney, Cameron, Scarlett too</i>

00:18:17,405 --> 00:18:19,405
<i>They all like a taste of my fondue</i>

211
00:18:20,725 --> 00:18:24,405
<i>Come to think of it
I've had so much ass</i>

212
00:18:24,605 --> 00:18:27,125
<i>All that's left for me is Lance Bass</i>

213
00:18:28,485 --> 00:18:31,285
Look, everyone. It's Jessica Simpson.

214

<i>All of this, all for Jesus</i>

216
00:18:51,365 --> 00:18:52,845
Put your pants back on, Dad.

217
00:18:53,045 --> 00:18:56,645
Go, Romo! Oh, my God.
He's gonna score a basket goal.

218
00:18:56,845 --> 00:18:59,445
Wait. What's it called again?
Oh, my gosh, I totally forget.

219
00:18:59,645 --> 00:19:01,685
What is it, a rubdown?

220
00:19:01,885 --> 00:19:03,725
What? A tickle down.

221
00:19:03,925 --> 00:19:06,485
Oh, a touchdown.

222
00:19:06,685 --> 00:19:08,165
Frigging jinx.

223
00:19:10,045 --> 00:19:11,565
Gosh.

Take a Xanax, Fabio.

243
00:20:17,285 --> 00:20:21,045
You're wigging harder than a
smack addict at an lggy show circa '73.

What?

245
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:26,605
It's cool, Moe Dee. Sir Cries-a-Lot.

246

You're totally giving me the stink eye.

00:23:49,045 --> 00:23:53,005
...this Wednesday, 8, 7 Central.

290
00:23:55,285 --> 00:23:58,645
I waited in line
for two days for these tickets.

291
00:23:58,845 --> 00:24:00,325
Damn.

292
00:24:02,485 --> 00:24:08,445
And let me just say, those totally sexy
and utterly provocative pictures of me...

293
00:24:08,645 --> 00:24:13,845
...were leaked onto MySpace
completely without my permission.

294
00:24:14,325 --> 00:24:16,685
But if you'll notice in those pictures...

295
00:24:16,885 --> 00:24:18,765
...l'm wearing my new line of sexy...

296

...Hannah Montana lingerie,

297
00:24:33,205 --> 00:24:35,645
Oh, my God. Hannah Montana
is really Miley Cyrus.

298
00:24:35,845 --> 00:24:38,485
Well, duh. No shit, Sherlock.

299
00:24:38,685 --> 00:24:42,005
All I do is wear a wig
and change my voice a little bit...

300
00:24:42,205 --> 00:24:45,245
...and those dumb kids
can't tell the difference.

301
00:24:45,445 --> 00:24:48,885
Then I get twice the pay
and twice the merchandise.

302
00:24:49,085 --> 00:24:51,365

00:25:17,085 --> 00:25:18,685
Hancock?

310
00:25:19,525 --> 00:25:20,685

311
00:25:22,565 --> 00:25:24,165
Wake up, you drunk motherfucker.

312
00:25:24,365 --> 00:25:27,405
Get your punk ass up,
fly down there, and fix that shit.

313

Big Willie's out of here.

316
00:25:47,765 --> 00:25:49,765
I need a drink.

317
00:25:57,445 --> 00:25:59,125
Holy shit!

318
00:25:59,325 --> 00:26:01,485
- It's coming this way.
- What should we do?

319
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:04,525
- Come on, guys. Let's get out of here.
- Let's go!

320
00:26:07,125 --> 00:26:09,165
This way. Over here.
Come on. Come on.

321
00:26:09,685 --> 00:26:10,685
Go, go, go.

322
00:26:18,165 --> 00:26:21,045
- What are we gonna do now?
- Baby, I don't know.

323
00:26:21,245 --> 00:26:22,445
Look, we'll just...

324
00:26:22,645 --> 00:26:25,165
We'll wait out the storm here
until it passes by.

325
00:26:28,125 --> 00:26:29,565
Hey.

326
00:26:33,845 --> 00:26:35,765
This is our hiding place.

327
00:26:35,925 --> 00:26:38,925
Get lost. Right, Carrie?

328
00:26:40,245 --> 00:26:41,725
Hello, lover.

329
00:26:44,885 --> 00:26:46,885
Unless you wanna fight.

330
00:26:47,085 --> 00:26:49,045
Look, we don't want any trouble.

331
00:26:55,405 --> 00:26:56,565
I never back down.

332
00:26:56,765 --> 00:27:01,445
- Get some.
- As you can see, I already did.

333
00:27:05,085 --> 00:27:08,605
<i>And so I thought: Could a simple
New York City gal like me...</i>

334
00:27:08,805 --> 00:27:12,405
<i>... really beat the shit
out of a pregnant teenager? I wonder.</i>

335
00:27:12,605 --> 00:27:16,925
<i>Like Dolph Lundgren in Rocky IV,
I must break you.</i>

336
00:27:24,885 --> 00:27:26,405
- Yes!
- Yeah!

337
00:27:45,525 --> 00:27:47,765
I'm lactating. Moo.

338
00:27:57,617 --> 00:27:59,217
Oh, God.

339
00:28:05,337 --> 00:28:06,937
- Is that your feet?
- Yeah.

340
00:28:07,137 --> 00:28:09,617
And this is my baby's foot.

341
00:28:12,217 --> 00:28:13,457
Smell it.

342
00:28:15,417 --> 00:28:16,377
And taste it.

343
00:28:18,057 --> 00:28:20,017
Suck on my placenta.

344
00:28:22,977 --> 00:28:25,657
- Yeah!
- Oh, Carrie.

345
00:28:25,857 --> 00:28:27,737
Carrie, darling, are you all right?

346
00:28:27,937 --> 00:28:30,497
Come on, ladies.
Let's get out of here now.

347
00:28:36,337 --> 00:28:38,177
- What the hell's going on?
- I don't know.

348
00:28:38,337 --> 00:28:40,777
Wake up and smell the Prius.

349
00:28:40,977 --> 00:28:44,737
I know it's an inconvenient truth,
but it's called global warming.

350
00:28:44,897 --> 00:28:47,617
No. No, it's not global warming.

351
00:28:49,057 --> 00:28:51,177
Amy Winehouse
came to me in my dreams...

352
00:28:51,377 --> 00:28:53,137
...after I fought an American Gladiator.

353
00:28:53,577 --> 00:28:55,977
I think it has something to do
with the crystal skull...

354
00:28:57,297 --> 00:28:59,897
Come on. Crackhead Winehouse?
Crystal skull?

355
00:29:00,097 --> 00:29:01,337
You sound like a crazy man.

356
00:29:01,537 --> 00:29:04,937
Look, it's getting late. Let's just stay
here tonight and wait out the storm.

357
00:29:05,377 --> 00:29:06,617
I'm freezing.

358
00:29:07,137 --> 00:29:08,497
We gotta take off our clothes.

359
00:29:10,497 --> 00:29:13,977
- What?
- Our bodies will keep each other warm.

360
00:29:14,177 --> 00:29:16,897
Otherwise, we're not gonna make it
through the night.

361
00:29:17,857 --> 00:29:19,097
Yeah. Yeah.

362
00:29:19,537 --> 00:29:21,937
He's right. Come on.

363
00:29:30,737 --> 00:29:32,697
I think my water's gonna break.

364
00:29:37,645 --> 00:29:39,165
Sorry.

365
00:29:43,445 --> 00:29:46,085
Look, I have something to tell you.
I'm not really a banker.

366
00:29:46,285 --> 00:29:47,725
- I'm a jumper.
- A what?

367
00:29:47,925 --> 00:29:49,605
I can teleport through time and space.

368
00:30:17,685 --> 00:30:20,005
I hope we stay together forever.

369
00:30:20,205 --> 00:30:21,325
I love you.

370
00:30:23,645 --> 00:30:24,965
Later.

371
00:30:28,885 --> 00:30:32,085
I am Prince Caspian,
here to save Narnia.

372
00:30:35,085 --> 00:30:36,565
Little help?

373
00:30:38,165 --> 00:30:39,725
You guys?

374
00:30:43,765 --> 00:30:45,685
<i>It's the guy who ruined Star Wars.</i>

375
00:30:51,045 --> 00:30:53,845
- What?
- Will, we saw your dream.

376
00:30:56,725 --> 00:30:58,925
- Oh, man.
- Man, you messed shit up with Amy.

377
00:30:59,125 --> 00:31:01,605
You're lucky a girl like that
would even talk to you.

378
00:31:01,805 --> 00:31:04,765
She's hot, sexy. She got a job.

379
00:31:05,125 --> 00:31:08,485
- Man, that girl out your league.
- She's not out of my league.

380
00:31:08,685 --> 00:31:11,325
Shit, she gotta put up
with your stank breath.

381
00:31:11,965 --> 00:31:15,205
Not to mention your
abnormally high plumber's crack.

382
00:31:20,205 --> 00:31:21,445
Man, put your shirt down.

383
00:31:21,645 --> 00:31:24,525
All right. You're right, you're right.
I messed up with Amy.

384
00:31:27,725 --> 00:31:29,405
I never should've let her go.

385
00:31:31,805 --> 00:31:34,325
Jesus Christ. That was a rump shaker.

386
00:31:34,525 --> 00:31:37,725
Okay, here's the plan.
We gotta get the hell up out this city.

387
00:31:37,925 --> 00:31:39,445
What you say?

388
00:31:40,165 --> 00:31:43,285
What the hell y'all doing leaving me?

389
00:31:45,685 --> 00:31:47,805
Keep it moving, people. Nothing to see.

390
00:31:48,765 --> 00:31:51,965
All the disasters have been contained.
The city is secure.

391
00:31:58,085 --> 00:31:59,045
Shit.

392
00:32:00,485 --> 00:32:01,445
Sick.

393
00:32:04,085 --> 00:32:06,965
Like I said, keep moving.
It's under control.

394
00:32:11,765 --> 00:32:12,725
I'm out of here.

395
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:21,965
- What was that?
- That was a head. That was a head.

396
00:32:22,165 --> 00:32:24,525
- Hello?
- Whose head?

397
00:32:24,725 --> 00:32:25,965
<i>- Hello?
- Will, it's me.</i>

398
00:32:26,165 --> 00:32:27,885
Amy, where are you?

399
00:32:28,085 --> 00:32:31,045
I'm at work at the museum.
I was worried about the artifacts.

400
00:32:31,245 --> 00:32:34,045
- Are you okay?
- I'm scared.

401
00:32:34,645 --> 00:32:36,525
It's gonna be all right, I promise. Listen.

402
00:32:36,725 --> 00:32:39,405
There is something
that I need to tell you...

403
00:32:39,605 --> 00:32:41,765
...and I should've told you long before.
I was an idiot.

404
00:32:45,725 --> 00:32:46,725
I love you.

405
00:32:49,125 --> 00:32:51,325
<i>Oh, baby, I love you too.</i>

406
00:32:53,365 --> 00:32:57,005
What do...? What do you say?
Do you still love me?

407
00:32:57,205 --> 00:32:59,845
<i>Yes, yes, of course, yes.</i>

408
00:33:00,525 --> 00:33:01,445
<i>Say something.</i>

409
00:33:03,445 --> 00:33:04,965
Say something, you stuck-up bitch.

410
00:33:09,445 --> 00:33:10,525
Asshole.

411
00:33:11,325 --> 00:33:12,845
Hello? Hello, Amy?

412
00:33:13,725 --> 00:33:15,285
Shit.

413
00:33:17,645 --> 00:33:19,365
Oh, what the...?

414
00:33:20,085 --> 00:33:21,925
- We gotta go back.
- Say what?

415
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:23,845
Amy's in trouble.
I'm going back for her.

416
00:33:24,045 --> 00:33:26,045
I let her go before.
I'm not losing her again.

417
00:33:26,245 --> 00:33:29,325
Man, you crazy. There's all kinds
of shit breaking out in the city.

418
00:33:29,525 --> 00:33:31,885
We don't leave right now,
we're gonna die.

419
00:33:32,085 --> 00:33:33,685
It's something I gotta do.

420
00:33:33,885 --> 00:33:34,925
You guys keep going.

421
00:33:38,285 --> 00:33:40,285
No, I'm your boy, man.
I'm gonna roll with you.

422
00:33:40,485 --> 00:33:42,765
Yeah, I mean, I'm already knocked up...

423
00:33:42,965 --> 00:33:46,965
...so, what other shenanigans
can I really get into?

424
00:33:47,165 --> 00:33:50,565
<i>I mean, I'm more bloated
than Vince Vaughn in The Break-Up...</i>

425
00:33:50,765 --> 00:33:53,085
<i>...or Vince Vaughn in Fred Claus...</i>

426
00:33:54,525 --> 00:33:56,405
...or I guess Vince Vaughn in general.

427
00:33:56,605 --> 00:33:59,205
- So let's go.
- Yeah, please.

428
00:34:01,525 --> 00:34:03,005
Lisa, come on.

429
00:34:03,205 --> 00:34:05,205
- No, guys.
- Come on, baby.

430
00:34:05,405 --> 00:34:07,285
I really have a bad feeling about this.

431
00:34:12,125 --> 00:34:13,565
Lisa!

432
00:34:13,765 --> 00:34:15,245
They killed Lisa!

433
00:34:15,445 --> 00:34:16,525
- Lisa!
- Come on, come on.

434
00:34:16,725 --> 00:34:19,725
- They killed Lisa! You bastards!
- Come on, come on. We gotta go.

435
00:34:19,925 --> 00:34:21,365
Come on.

436
00:34:28,685 --> 00:34:31,445
I'm really sorry about your girlfriend,
home skillet.

437
00:34:31,645 --> 00:34:34,325
<i>Lo ciento about your main squeeze,
kemosabe.</i>

438
00:34:39,872 --> 00:34:41,072
Lisa was a great girl.

439
00:34:50,872 --> 00:34:52,832
Lisa who?

440
00:34:53,232 --> 00:34:54,472
Oh, where am I?

441
00:34:54,952 --> 00:34:57,232
Oh, what an enchanting place.

442
00:34:59,072 --> 00:35:01,992
It smells like meat and stress.

443
00:35:05,552 --> 00:35:06,552
Wonderful.

444
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:08,792
What magical creature are you?

445
00:35:15,152 --> 00:35:16,552
<i>My dear prince</i>

446
00:35:16,752 --> 00:35:24,752
<i>You have rescued me
You've caught me in your arms</i>

447
00:35:24,952 --> 00:35:29,992
<i>Actually, you landed on my balls</i>

448
00:35:30,192 --> 00:35:31,472
Let me guess.

449
00:35:31,672 --> 00:35:35,512
An evil witch banished you
from your fairy-tale kingdom?

450
00:35:37,432 --> 00:35:39,792
No, my silly, pasty, quirky teen.

451
00:35:39,992 --> 00:35:43,352
Actually, I'm just a demented
homeless chick who lives in the sewers.

452
00:35:44,432 --> 00:35:46,032
- How'd you end up there?
- Drugs.

453
00:35:46,232 --> 00:35:49,392
Lots and lots and lots...

454
00:35:49,592 --> 00:35:54,032
...of mind-altering, enchanting drugs!

455
00:35:56,432 --> 00:35:58,352
I don't judge.

456
00:36:00,952 --> 00:36:02,432
It's dangerous out there.

457
00:36:02,672 --> 00:36:05,352
You might wanna come with us
if you wanna live.

458
00:36:05,552 --> 00:36:06,952
- Okay.
- All right.

459
00:36:07,152 --> 00:36:09,952
- Goodbye. Oh, I'm going with you.
- Yes, you are.

460
00:36:10,152 --> 00:36:12,872
The Natural History Museum
is just uptown. Let's go.

461
00:36:18,152 --> 00:36:22,312
<i>Dreams and fairy tales
My true love</i>

462
00:36:22,952 --> 00:36:27,632
<i>Talking squirrels and magic and stuff</i>

463
00:36:28,272 --> 00:36:31,032
No, princess, wait.
Where are you going?

464
00:36:31,232 --> 00:36:33,552
And who's that Moorish ruffian?

465
00:36:33,752 --> 00:36:35,952
I'm her new boyfriend. What it do?

466
00:36:37,432 --> 00:36:40,432
Very funny, dark peasant.
I'm Prince Edwin.

467
00:36:41,472 --> 00:36:44,672
- Princess, he your pimp?
- Oh, good heavens, yes.

468
00:36:46,632 --> 00:36:49,832
But that's all right.
I could have a pimp and a boyfriend.

469
00:36:50,712 --> 00:36:51,872
Oh, what to do?

470
00:36:54,192 --> 00:36:58,552
Whichever prince can vanquish
the other shall win my hand.

471
00:37:05,392 --> 00:37:06,432
You ready to step up?

472
00:37:07,832 --> 00:37:09,832
<i>Wait. You mean like
the first Step Up movie...</i>

473
00:37:10,032 --> 00:37:12,592
...where the street-dancer dude
went to the dance academy?

474
00:37:12,792 --> 00:37:14,752
<i>No, I was thinking

475
00:37:14,992 --> 00:37:17,752
...when the tough street-dancing chick
went to dancing academy.

476
00:37:18,632 --> 00:37:19,632
I feel you.

477
00:37:19,832 --> 00:37:23,512
He ain't ready for me. Juney, Will,
I'm about to break him down, baby.

478
00:37:23,712 --> 00:37:25,952
You want some? Well, here you go.

479
00:37:35,152 --> 00:37:36,832
Oh, a hoedown?

480
00:37:39,072 --> 00:37:40,032
It's crazy-shirt man.

481
00:37:45,032 --> 00:37:47,032
Oh, no, no, no.

482
00:37:52,032 --> 00:37:53,352
It's just my sleeve.

483
00:37:53,552 --> 00:37:55,512
Oh, come on.

484
00:37:56,392 --> 00:37:58,152
He's double-jointed.
Who cares about that?

485
00:38:00,512 --> 00:38:01,992
There must be a mirror somewhere.

486
00:38:04,592 --> 00:38:06,352
Make some room. Make some room.

487
00:38:06,552 --> 00:38:07,752
Make some room.

488
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:10,352
- Come on, chubby.
- Okay.

489
00:38:11,912 --> 00:38:13,792
What? What? What?

490
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:16,752
Oh, damn, that ho is all on point.

491
00:38:27,232 --> 00:38:29,872
That bitch better work.
She is off the chizzain.

492
00:38:30,072 --> 00:38:31,152
I think she's crowning.

493
00:38:33,912 --> 00:38:35,592
I want to dance.

494
00:38:35,792 --> 00:38:39,032
I'm not sure I can though. I'm not sure.

495
00:38:39,232 --> 00:38:42,072
L... Don't pressure me!

496
00:38:43,792 --> 00:38:45,352
I'm ready.

497
00:38:45,872 --> 00:38:48,192
Oh, look out. Look at her coming in.

498
00:38:49,792 --> 00:38:50,872
Oh, yeah.

499
00:39:30,832 --> 00:39:32,872
I'm out of here.

500
00:39:33,552 --> 00:39:34,752
Bye.

501
00:39:34,952 --> 00:39:37,272
She's all yours, bro.

502
00:39:37,872 --> 00:39:39,112
It's a twister!

503
00:39:39,312 --> 00:39:41,432
Run! Run!

504
00:39:48,712 --> 00:39:50,752
Is there anyone that can save us?

505
00:39:50,952 --> 00:39:52,752
We need a hero.

506
00:40:00,592 --> 00:40:02,192
I am Iron Man.

507
00:40:04,712 --> 00:40:07,632
Oh, man! That twister shat out a cow.

508
00:40:09,072 --> 00:40:10,352
Shit. That's so messed up.

509
00:40:14,152 --> 00:40:16,472
Now you're pissing me off.

510
00:40:19,232 --> 00:40:21,632
I'm the only badass around here.

511
00:40:23,992 --> 00:40:25,632
Oh, damn!

512
00:40:25,832 --> 00:40:27,432
Another cow?

513
00:40:33,912 --> 00:40:35,312
What was that?

514
00:40:35,512 --> 00:40:36,832
It's not nice.

515
00:40:37,032 --> 00:40:39,312
Look at me. Look at this.

516
00:40:39,512 --> 00:40:41,032
It's a lobster claw.

517
00:40:41,232 --> 00:40:42,192
Whatever.

518
00:40:42,392 --> 00:40:45,832
Look, I'm carrying a lot of baggage.
I didn't need that, man.

519
00:40:49,552 --> 00:40:53,832
Don't make me angry.
You wouldn't like me when I'm angry.

520
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:57,912
There's aspects of my personality
that I can't control.

521
00:41:15,032 --> 00:41:16,872
At least he didn't get hit with a cow.

522
00:41:19,472 --> 00:41:22,232
- Man!
- Hey, Casanova, forget Amy.

523
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:24,232
We're never gonna make it
to the museum.

524
00:41:24,432 --> 00:41:25,712
I know she's still alive.

<i>Hello? Jojo?</i>

526
00:41:28,272 --> 00:41:30,752
Jojo? No, no, it's me.

00:41:30,952 --> 00:41:33,112
Will. Will, I'm trapped.

530
00:41:39,232 --> 00:41:41,952
I'm so scared. I'm so scared.

531
00:41:42,152 --> 00:41:44,712
All right, Amy, listen to me. Don't panic.

532
00:41:47,552 --> 00:41:49,272
I will be there, I promise.

533
00:41:52,672 --> 00:41:54,792
Amy? Amy?

534
00:41:56,992 --> 00:41:59,072
Guys, I'm going back for her.

535
00:42:01,792 --> 00:42:05,552
You can't save her if you're dead!
Come on, let's go!

536
00:42:05,752 --> 00:42:07,512
- I'll be there as soon as I can.
- Go, go.

537
00:42:07,712 --> 00:42:08,752
Goodbye.

538
00:42:08,952 --> 00:42:10,112
- Amy. No!
- Will, let's go.

539
00:42:10,312 --> 00:42:11,912
- No! Damn it!
- You got to!

540
00:42:21,072 --> 00:42:22,312
I know you think I'm crazy...

541
00:42:22,512 --> 00:42:25,232
...but these disasters have to do
with the crystal skull.

542
00:42:25,432 --> 00:42:28,752
- It's like TMTH.
- TM what?

543
00:42:28,952 --> 00:42:30,992
Too much to handle.

544
00:42:31,392 --> 00:42:32,912
Bitch, why you don't just say that?

545
00:42:33,112 --> 00:42:35,672
Why everything a goddamn acronym
with you?

546
00:42:35,872 --> 00:42:38,752
Chilly Willy out, LL Not Cool J.

547
00:42:38,952 --> 00:42:42,632
Oh, do stop all of this quarreling.
Honestly.

548
00:42:42,832 --> 00:42:45,312
Now, who's hungry?

549
00:42:53,432 --> 00:42:54,752
Delicious.

550
00:42:55,552 --> 00:42:57,232
Whatever.

551
00:42:58,552 --> 00:42:59,672
Would you like some?

552
00:43:00,112 --> 00:43:01,112
No.

553
00:43:07,992 --> 00:43:09,472
What?

554
00:43:10,032 --> 00:43:12,632
<i>Y'all, that's my Get Smart phone.
Just give me a minute.</i>

555
00:43:21,392 --> 00:43:23,352
You got poop.

556
00:43:23,832 --> 00:43:24,792
Just a smidge.

557
00:43:28,792 --> 00:43:31,512
Did I get it? Did I get it all?

558
00:43:33,072 --> 00:43:34,832
What y'all looking at me like that for?

559
00:43:35,032 --> 00:43:36,512
You got... Yeah.

560
00:43:37,072 --> 00:43:38,032
Is it right there?

561
00:43:38,832 --> 00:43:41,232
- It's fine.
- Just go:

562
00:43:41,592 --> 00:43:43,872
Just... I get it all the time, all over.

563
00:43:48,432 --> 00:43:49,992
What it do?

564
00:43:52,912 --> 00:43:56,232
Hey, y'all, it's Lisa's mom.

565
00:43:56,752 --> 00:43:59,152
I gotta tell her what happened
to her daughter.

566
00:44:03,952 --> 00:44:05,552
Hi, Miss Heller.

567
00:44:09,872 --> 00:44:11,272
Lisa...

568
00:44:11,792 --> 00:44:13,312
Lisa dead.

569
00:44:15,672 --> 00:44:16,992
But booyah!

570
00:44:17,952 --> 00:44:21,232
I met this fine, hot
enchanted-princess chick...

571
00:44:21,432 --> 00:44:24,792
...willing to do anything
and everything I want.

572
00:44:24,992 --> 00:44:27,032
You gotta talk to her. Talk to her.

573
00:44:27,272 --> 00:44:31,552
Hello? Oh, yes, he's right.
I will do anything. Truly.

574
00:44:31,893 --> 00:44:34,173
If you've got 5 bucks or some meth,
I'll show you.

575
00:44:34,373 --> 00:44:36,481
One time I hooked up
with a 1-year-old wizard.

576
00:44:36,483 --> 00:44:37,923
Never again.

577
00:44:38,123 --> 00:44:41,163
You're so cool.
We should totally hang out.

578

<i>She's awesome.</i>

579
00:44:43,283 --> 00:44:45,363
Look, we gotta get to Amy
at the Natural History Museum.

580
00:44:49,054 --> 00:44:50,014
Oh, my.

581
00:44:50,454 --> 00:44:53,214
- Oh, no.
- I can't see anything.

582
00:44:53,454 --> 00:44:57,214
- Neither can I.
- Somebody is totally feeling me up.

583
00:44:57,414 --> 00:44:59,534
- Calvin.
- I didn't do it.

584
00:45:02,254 --> 00:45:04,974
They're so perky.
They're filled with milk.

585
00:45:07,374 --> 00:45:09,254
What the hell was that?

586
00:45:53,414 --> 00:45:56,974
Wonderful.
What adorable woodland creatures.

587
00:45:57,174 --> 00:46:00,534
I'm not merry, really. That didn't...
I mean, that didn't make me merry.

588
00:46:00,734 --> 00:46:03,614
I don't feel merry, I guess.

589
00:46:38,294 --> 00:46:39,574
Man, them guys are all right.

590
00:46:40,134 --> 00:46:41,694
That's cute. That's cute.

591
00:47:15,134 --> 00:47:19,014
Okay, you guys are not
Alvin and the Chipmunks, are you?

592
00:47:21,534 --> 00:47:22,814
I think that one's got rabies.

593
00:47:27,574 --> 00:47:29,214
Where you going, punk-ass?

594
00:47:32,254 --> 00:47:34,414
Alvin!

595
00:47:40,094 --> 00:47:41,694
Get him off!

596
00:47:42,819 --> 00:47:44,699
Chipmunks love nuts.

597
00:47:47,277 --> 00:47:50,477
Get him off! What the hell?
I thought you was my friend!

598
00:47:51,157 --> 00:47:52,077
Salty.

599
00:47:56,068 --> 00:47:58,948
You're hitting the wrong thing! You...!

600
00:48:00,529 --> 00:48:04,489
I feel left out.
No one's biting my flesh. Pooh.

601
00:48:07,222 --> 00:48:08,982
Is that the best you got, pussy?

602
00:48:12,354 --> 00:48:13,394
You are such a girl.

603
00:48:28,354 --> 00:48:29,954
Redrum!

604
00:48:39,434 --> 00:48:41,154
Where'd he go?

605
00:48:49,314 --> 00:48:50,394
Yeah!

606
00:48:53,674 --> 00:48:55,394
Don't bite me. Get lost!

607
00:49:03,914 --> 00:49:05,994
Oh, boy, tasty vertebrae.

608
00:49:06,954 --> 00:49:08,154
- Juney.
- Let her go.

609
00:49:08,354 --> 00:49:10,114
Let her go, man.
Ain't nothing we can do.

610
00:49:10,314 --> 00:49:11,634
But she's still alive.

611
00:49:11,834 --> 00:49:13,154
They're munching me harder...

Yeah.

614
00:49:18,754 --> 00:49:22,914
Even when the bitch is dying,
she don't shut up with her witty repartee.

Hey, BFFs, what's the 411 on the 911?

616
00:49:26,874 --> 00:49:29,074
Oh, she is rather annoying.

617
00:49:29,274 --> 00:49:33,114
WTH? I'm so not ROTFLOL'ing...

618
00:49:33,314 --> 00:49:38,194
...but please KIT, before I get 187'd.

619
00:49:39,434 --> 00:49:41,234
Blog you later.

That was just the amuse bouche.
Now the main course.

00:49:51,594 --> 00:49:53,874
- Come back here, you bitches.
- Bitches!

623
00:49:54,074 --> 00:49:56,034
I'll get you in your grill.

624

Pussies.

625

Die!

626
00:49:59,114 --> 00:50:02,394
Can't breathe. Need air.

627
00:50:04,314 --> 00:50:05,794
Shitheads!

628
00:50:12,714 --> 00:50:14,754
Is everybody okay?

629
00:50:14,954 --> 00:50:16,594
Yeah, I'm okay.

630
00:50:16,794 --> 00:50:20,194
Hey, baby, your knees
are all skinned up.

631

Oh, yes, but that's not

632
00:50:24,794 --> 00:50:27,034
But I do have this terrible headache.

00:50:36,274 --> 00:50:38,314
<i>Head On.
Apply directly to the forehead.</i>

637
00:50:38,514 --> 00:50:40,194
I just... I just did.

638
00:50:40,394 --> 00:50:41,794
<i>I said, Head On, bitch.</i>

639
00:50:41,994 --> 00:50:43,914
<i>- Apply directly to the forehead.
- Whatever.</i>

640
00:50:44,074 --> 00:50:45,514
<i>Don't cop an attitude, slut.</i>

641
00:50:45,714 --> 00:50:49,114
<i>I said, apply Head On directly
to your goddamn forehead.</i>

642
00:50:49,354 --> 00:50:52,074
Okay, okay. Happy?

643
00:50:52,274 --> 00:50:54,234
<i>Look, you little white-trash
piece of shit...</i>

644
00:50:54,434 --> 00:50:55,554
<i>... Head On, motherfucker.</i>

645
00:50:55,754 --> 00:50:58,354
<i>Apply directly to your
motherfucking forehead.</i>

646
00:50:58,554 --> 00:51:01,514
Okay? There. It's all over.

647
00:51:01,714 --> 00:51:06,114
Head on, face on, nose on, eyes on.

648
00:51:08,154 --> 00:51:09,794
Oh, that's great.

649
00:51:09,994 --> 00:51:11,314
My headache is gone...

650
00:51:11,514 --> 00:51:14,474
...but I still have that dreadful
yeast infection.

651
00:51:15,754 --> 00:51:17,114
Sourdough anyone?

652
00:51:17,834 --> 00:51:20,514
- I could've did without that.
- Let's get to the museum.

653
00:51:24,914 --> 00:51:27,034
- Let's go!
- Move it!

654
00:51:27,234 --> 00:51:29,114
Out of the way!

655
00:51:37,234 --> 00:51:38,754
Excuse me, sir.

656
00:51:38,954 --> 00:51:40,914
What's going on?
Where's everybody going?

657
00:51:41,114 --> 00:51:44,114
It's a mass evacuation. Everyone
has to leave the city right now.

658
00:51:44,314 --> 00:51:45,994
Hold up, hold up.
You leaving, Batman?

659
00:51:46,194 --> 00:51:49,874
Shit. Yes. Yeah, I'm leaving. Okay?
I don't wanna die.

660
00:51:50,074 --> 00:51:52,074
Not on my schedule today.
Not on my to-do list.

661
00:51:52,274 --> 00:51:55,474
It wasn't, "Wake up, make breakfast, jog,
science experiment, die."

662
00:51:55,674 --> 00:51:59,514
Not on it. Not on it. Okay?
Are we done?

663
00:51:59,714 --> 00:52:00,994
All right.

664
00:52:01,674 --> 00:52:04,354
Anyone who stays in town
is gonna be buried in rubble.

665
00:52:04,554 --> 00:52:05,634
I hate rubble.

666
00:52:05,834 --> 00:52:09,354
I've gotta get to the Natural History
Museum, to my girl, Amy. She's trapped.

667
00:52:09,554 --> 00:52:12,834
If you go back after your girlfriend,
you have zero chance of survival.

668
00:52:13,154 --> 00:52:14,274
I'll take those odds.

669
00:52:16,134 --> 00:52:19,294
Look, the evacuation bus
is leaving city hall at 21 hours.

670
00:52:19,494 --> 00:52:22,174
Twenty-one hundred?
Hold on, what is...? That's...

671
00:52:22,334 --> 00:52:24,414
- Five, carry the six...
- Nine p.m.

672
00:52:24,614 --> 00:52:27,174
I'm gonna save you your crazy math.
It's 9 p.m.

673
00:52:27,374 --> 00:52:29,574
You start at noon, then nine hours later.

674
00:52:29,774 --> 00:52:32,934
That's 9. That's the time you need
to get on those evacuation buses...

675
00:52:33,134 --> 00:52:34,574
...or you're dead.

676
00:52:34,774 --> 00:52:36,174
Dead?

677
00:52:37,454 --> 00:52:39,534
Come on, it's already 5:3.

678
00:52:40,294 --> 00:52:42,534
Say again, 5:3? Oh, Jesus.

679
00:52:42,734 --> 00:52:45,174
Oh, God. I wasted the whole day.

680
00:52:45,374 --> 00:52:48,494
I was... I was on Amazon
looking for stuff.

681
00:52:48,694 --> 00:52:51,894
Shit. Why? Why would I
go Christmas shopping today?

682
00:52:52,534 --> 00:52:56,214
Why would I pick today?
Son of a bitch. Okay, plan B.

683
00:53:00,854 --> 00:53:02,134
- Hi.
- Hi.

684
00:53:02,334 --> 00:53:03,294
I'm Batman.

685
00:53:03,494 --> 00:53:05,214
I'm Enchanted Princess.

686
00:53:05,414 --> 00:53:07,934
True story: I had a woman one time...

687
00:53:08,134 --> 00:53:12,214
...tell me I was in the top four
best lovers she's ever had.

688
00:53:12,414 --> 00:53:13,734
That's a true story.

689
00:53:13,934 --> 00:53:15,494
And she had been around the block.

690
00:53:17,934 --> 00:53:21,854
Would you want to watch me
play with myself?

691
00:53:23,454 --> 00:53:24,374
Goodbye.

692
00:53:35,494 --> 00:53:36,934
Come on, let's go.

693
00:53:40,014 --> 00:53:41,254
Break yourself, fool.

694
00:53:41,454 --> 00:53:44,414
You best be getting out of that Mach 5
or I'll toe-tag your ass.

695
00:53:53,094 --> 00:53:55,214
You know, they say that the first kill...

696
00:53:55,414 --> 00:53:57,134
...is supposed to be quite difficult.

697
00:53:57,334 --> 00:54:00,854
But I find it easy. In fact, rather fun.

698
00:54:01,774 --> 00:54:04,454
Take it. Do it.

699
00:54:09,774 --> 00:54:11,454
Look, Ma, no eyes.

700
00:54:11,654 --> 00:54:13,094
I didn't have a mother!

701
00:54:27,632 --> 00:54:30,512
What? We're just playing
with my monkey.

702
00:54:34,952 --> 00:54:36,432
Let's roll.

703
00:54:39,792 --> 00:54:40,872
Oh, my!

704
00:54:52,632 --> 00:54:53,592
Come on!

705
00:54:55,832 --> 00:54:57,112
Run.

706
00:54:58,752 --> 00:55:00,472
We gotta keep going.

707
00:55:02,032 --> 00:55:04,792
These glass slippers
are awfully hard to run in.

708
00:55:12,632 --> 00:55:14,232
Help. Help.

709
00:55:14,992 --> 00:55:16,232
Amy.

710
00:55:18,272 --> 00:55:20,432
- You came back for me.
- I love you, Amy.

711
00:55:21,072 --> 00:55:23,872
I know. I love you too.

712
00:55:25,472 --> 00:55:27,672
Now get this freaking spear
out of my shoulder.

713
00:55:27,872 --> 00:55:28,832
Yeah.

714
00:55:29,712 --> 00:55:30,992
- Okay.
- It hurts.

715
00:55:31,192 --> 00:55:32,312
Okay. All right.

716
00:55:32,512 --> 00:55:34,432
She's pinned through to the floor, guys.

717
00:55:34,632 --> 00:55:37,272
This isn't gonna be easy.
Calvin, I'm gonna need your help.

718
00:55:37,472 --> 00:55:39,032
Right.

719
00:55:43,472 --> 00:55:46,312
- What was that for?
- I was trying to knock her unconscious...

720
00:55:46,512 --> 00:55:47,792
...so she wouldn't feel pain.

721
00:55:49,032 --> 00:55:50,592
Good thinking.

722
00:55:51,152 --> 00:55:54,392
- Baby, this is for your own good.
- Okay.

723
00:56:01,472 --> 00:56:05,592
Man, you hit like a pussy. Let me try.

724
00:56:12,912 --> 00:56:14,512
Man, this girl can take a hit.

725
00:56:23,192 --> 00:56:24,872
Why?

726
00:56:26,352 --> 00:56:28,672
It's not working.
Let's just pull it out of her.

727
00:56:30,312 --> 00:56:31,232
On the count of three.

728
00:56:31,472 --> 00:56:33,792
One, two, three.

729
00:56:33,992 --> 00:56:35,352
Good job.

730
00:56:46,712 --> 00:56:49,192
We gotta get out of here.
This place is gonna collapse.

731
00:56:49,752 --> 00:56:54,992
No. Not until we return this...

732
00:56:55,912 --> 00:56:57,392
...back to the altar.

733
00:56:57,872 --> 00:56:59,552
A magic bong.

734
00:56:59,752 --> 00:57:02,472
The crystal skull.
The one from my dreams.

735
00:57:02,632 --> 00:57:06,872
Now, legend has it that if the
crystal skull is missing from the altar...

736
00:57:07,072 --> 00:57:09,152
...it's the end of the world.
Earthquakes...

737
00:57:09,352 --> 00:57:11,752
...asteroids, return of the Spice Girls.

738
00:57:11,952 --> 00:57:13,032
Yes!

739
00:57:14,592 --> 00:57:15,552
The apocalypse.

740
00:57:15,752 --> 00:57:18,152
And you know this shit
because you're the docent?

741
00:57:18,352 --> 00:57:20,912
<i>I saw Indiana Jones and the Kingdom
of the Crystal Skull.</i>

742
00:57:21,112 --> 00:57:22,632
Do you know what this means?

743
00:57:22,832 --> 00:57:25,592
Me dreaming about the skull,
and you knowing about the skull?

744
00:57:25,792 --> 00:57:29,232
- That we were destined to be together?
- No, that we both really love skulls.

745
00:57:30,312 --> 00:57:31,912
But that too.

746
00:57:33,512 --> 00:57:35,912
Will, we gotta get out of here.
It's almost 9:

747
00:57:36,112 --> 00:57:39,192
If we don't make it to them
evacuation buses, we're gonna die.

748
00:57:41,392 --> 00:57:42,752
Go, Calvin.

749
00:57:42,952 --> 00:57:45,832
I'm staying here with Amy.
We're returning the skull to the altar.

750
00:57:47,712 --> 00:57:49,312
- See you.
- Nice meeting you.

751
00:57:49,832 --> 00:57:51,832
Let's find that altar.

752
00:58:18,672 --> 00:58:19,632
What's happening?

753
00:58:19,832 --> 00:58:22,952
Everything in the museum
is coming to life.

754
00:58:25,472 --> 00:58:27,032
Hell, no!

755
00:58:28,232 --> 00:58:29,392
Bully! Bully!

756
00:58:30,912 --> 00:58:32,032
Yes!

757
00:58:35,752 --> 00:58:38,392
- Let's get the hell up out of here.
- Drugs are great.

758
00:58:42,792 --> 00:58:45,632
- The altar to the crystal skull is this way.
- Okay.

759
00:58:51,552 --> 00:58:53,232
I am Beowulf.

760
00:58:57,752 --> 00:58:58,912
Hello.

761
00:59:01,472 --> 00:59:02,672
What?

762
00:59:03,912 --> 00:59:05,112
I am Beowulf.

763
00:59:06,792 --> 00:59:09,072
- Can you put some clothes on?
- I am Beowulf.

764
00:59:09,272 --> 00:59:12,952
I fought the monster Grendel with
no armor, and that is how I'll fight you.

765
00:59:13,832 --> 00:59:15,232
Wait. You fight naked?

766
00:59:18,152 --> 00:59:19,112
I am Beowulf.

767
00:59:19,312 --> 00:59:20,472
That's kind of gay, bro.

768
00:59:20,952 --> 00:59:22,832
It's not... It's not gay. It's...

769
00:59:23,032 --> 00:59:24,872
No, I'm sorry. That's gay.

770
00:59:25,072 --> 00:59:26,832
It's not gay. It's not.

771
00:59:27,032 --> 00:59:30,512
It's how we do it in 57, dick.

772
00:59:30,712 --> 00:59:33,472
- Ask anybody.
- All right, I will. I'll ask my friend Paul.

773
00:59:33,672 --> 00:59:36,672
We're boating tomorrow.
I'll ask him when we're out in the seas.

774
00:59:37,272 --> 00:59:40,472
- Paul?
- My friend Paul, who is my partner.

775
00:59:41,952 --> 00:59:44,352
He's my friend. We're also partners.

776
00:59:45,352 --> 00:59:47,952
- Life partner?
- No, business partners.

777
00:59:48,152 --> 00:59:50,872
We opened an antique shop together.

778
00:59:51,072 --> 00:59:52,752
- That's gay.
- Why is that gay?

779
00:59:52,952 --> 00:59:56,192
Why are antiques gay? Because
I like old things that are kitschy?

780
00:59:58,312 --> 00:59:59,992
I'm Beowulf!

781
01:00:00,392 --> 01:00:03,592
Excuse me, are you ready
to get your ass kicked?

782
01:00:09,712 --> 01:00:13,392
Oh, hell, no, Kung Fu Panda.

783
01:00:14,072 --> 01:00:16,472
You shouldn't have done that.

784
01:00:22,272 --> 01:00:24,752
Get ready to feel the thunder.

785
01:00:52,032 --> 01:00:53,792
Your girl looks familiar, man.

786
01:00:53,992 --> 01:00:58,472
Last year, I paid her 2 bucks
for 2 minutes, if you know what I mean.

787
01:01:01,456 --> 01:01:03,936
It's true.

788
01:01:04,175 --> 01:01:05,655
That's it.

789
01:01:56,335 --> 01:01:57,655
Oh, shit.

790
01:02:05,295 --> 01:02:07,335
Oh, wonderful job.

791
01:02:10,015 --> 01:02:14,935
<i>My dear prince
You have defended my honor</i>

792
01:02:15,815 --> 01:02:17,455
Kiss me, baby.

793
01:02:38,624 --> 01:02:41,944
- You a dude?
- I'm a trannie. I thought you knew.

794
01:02:43,104 --> 01:02:44,504
No.

795
01:02:55,064 --> 01:02:56,224
Get him, Will.

796
01:02:57,024 --> 01:02:59,384
- I am Beowulf.
- Yeah, I know already.

797
01:02:59,584 --> 01:03:02,024
Surrender so we can go get brunch.

798
01:03:02,224 --> 01:03:05,344
<i>And I got us tickets to Jersey Boys.</i>

799
01:03:05,584 --> 01:03:07,064
No.

800
01:03:15,452 --> 01:03:16,612
We can go to my place.

801
01:03:16,812 --> 01:03:20,492
<i>I TiVo'd Dancing with the Stars,
results show.</i>

802
01:03:20,652 --> 01:03:22,452
- No!
- Beowulf!

803
01:03:24,252 --> 01:03:26,852
I wanna take you
on Rosie O'Donnell's cruise.

804
01:03:27,052 --> 01:03:30,372
Just me, you,
and my dear friend George Takei.

805
01:03:30,852 --> 01:03:32,292
Screw this.

806
01:03:32,692 --> 01:03:34,892
I'm Beowulf!

807
01:03:36,132 --> 01:03:38,732
Beowulf out.

808
01:03:42,252 --> 01:03:43,772
Hurry, we're running out of time.

809
01:04:14,572 --> 01:04:16,092
Indiana Jones?

810
01:04:18,932 --> 01:04:20,292
Indiana, my ass.

811
01:04:21,932 --> 01:04:23,132
I'll take it from here.

812
01:04:29,372 --> 01:04:32,652
Thanks, son.
That's right, I'm your father.

813
01:04:34,732 --> 01:04:37,572
- You're my dad?
- Your mom got around.

814
01:04:37,772 --> 01:04:40,492
- A real slut, actually.
- Right, I get it.

815
01:04:41,430 --> 01:04:43,430
I'm sorry I walked out
on you and your mother.

816
01:04:43,630 --> 01:04:45,430
But I got an adventurous spirit...

817
01:04:45,630 --> 01:04:48,230
...and a hot-ass whore
in every major city.

818
01:04:49,790 --> 01:04:51,270
What do we have here?

819
01:04:51,470 --> 01:04:52,870
Is this your girl?

820
01:04:53,070 --> 01:04:56,150
- Yeah.
- What a nice young lady.

821
01:04:56,350 --> 01:04:58,070
And you got some shape on you.

822
01:04:58,270 --> 01:05:00,510
Yeah, baby. You're so nice.

823
01:05:00,710 --> 01:05:03,870
- And you got some ass on you.
- Dad.

824
01:05:04,070 --> 01:05:06,150
- Oh, so beautiful.
- Dad.

825
01:05:06,350 --> 01:05:10,070
If a nice ass meant a hamburger,
baby, you'd have a Whopper.

826
01:05:10,270 --> 01:05:11,630
- Oh, shit.
- Dad.

827
01:05:11,830 --> 01:05:15,390
Do you do Pilates?
I'm just asking. Just asking.

828
01:05:18,710 --> 01:05:21,510
Don't do what your old man did.
Settle down.

829
01:05:22,591 --> 01:05:26,591
There is no cure for herpes,
and I bullshit you not.

830
01:05:27,351 --> 01:05:29,031
Thanks, Dad.

831
01:05:47,807 --> 01:05:50,527
- This looks easy.
- Not as easy as it used to be.

832
01:05:54,607 --> 01:05:56,847
Oh, shit, my hip.

833
01:06:01,767 --> 01:06:04,647
- You know I gotta get my hustle on.
- Bye, Dad.

834
01:06:06,967 --> 01:06:08,087
I'm gonna make it.

835
01:06:08,247 --> 01:06:09,807
Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

836
01:06:10,007 --> 01:06:11,207
Oh, shit!

837
01:06:14,167 --> 01:06:16,887
That hurts. Oh, shit!

838
01:06:43,127 --> 01:06:48,047
Why don't you just walk to the altar?
It's like 1 feet away.

839
01:06:49,007 --> 01:06:50,767
Silly girl.

840
01:06:57,807 --> 01:07:00,767
No, don't cry. I'll be fine.

841
01:07:45,687 --> 01:07:47,287
I am the Guru Shitka.

842
01:07:47,487 --> 01:07:50,967
And we are here today
to bring together Amy and Will...

843
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:54,007
...in a union of peace and happiness.

844
01:07:54,167 --> 01:07:59,767
And to point out, gee,
Amy, you are totally hot. TM.

845
01:08:01,727 --> 01:08:03,247
Amy, do you take Will...

846
01:08:03,447 --> 01:08:06,967
...to be your peanut butter and jelly
that goes into your love belly?

847
01:08:07,167 --> 01:08:08,167
I do.

848
01:08:08,367 --> 01:08:12,567
And, Will, do you take Amy
to be your doughnut of love...

849
01:08:13,519 --> 01:08:14,479
I do.

850
01:08:17,559 --> 01:08:20,719
Well, in that case, give her a pound.

851
01:08:21,599 --> 01:08:23,639
Lock it down.

852
01:08:23,999 --> 01:08:25,759
Break the pickle.

853
01:08:26,159 --> 01:08:27,279
Now, tickle my pickle.

854
01:08:36,159 --> 01:08:37,119
I love you, Will.

855
01:08:37,319 --> 01:08:39,319
I love you too, Amy.

856
01:08:39,599 --> 01:08:41,919
But there's something I should tell you.

857
01:08:42,999 --> 01:08:43,959
What is it?

858
01:08:56,199 --> 01:08:57,399
<i>I'm fucking Matt Damon</i>

859
01:08:58,039 --> 01:09:00,279
You're fucking Matt Damon?

860
01:09:00,479 --> 01:09:01,919
<i>Well, I'm fucking Hannah Montana</i>

861
01:09:02,119 --> 01:09:03,479
<i>She's fucking Hannah Montana</i>

862
01:09:03,679 --> 01:09:07,119
<i>Backstage at my concert
Fucks me on my parents' bed</i>

863
01:09:07,319 --> 01:09:10,239
<i>After school, at my locker,
In the car I give her head</i>

864
01:09:10,439 --> 01:09:11,919
<i>I'm also fucking the Flava</i>

865
01:09:12,119 --> 01:09:14,479
<i>Yeah, boy
She's fucking Flava-Flav, fool</i>

866
01:09:14,679 --> 01:09:17,359
<i>You know what time it is
Because I'm fucking Juney too</i>

867
01:09:18,399 --> 01:09:21,679
<i>Yeah, I know, but it's true
Flava-Flav, he fucks me too</i>

868
01:09:21,879 --> 01:09:24,999
<i>And I swap with Calvin
And he swaps with that dude</i>

869
01:09:25,199 --> 01:09:26,559
<i>And we're all fucking Hellboy</i>

870
01:09:27,319 --> 01:09:32,839
<i>Yeah, they're fucking Hellboy
And I'm fucking the Hulk</i>

871
01:09:33,039 --> 01:09:36,279
<i>When I get really mad
I start fucking Iron Man</i>

872
01:09:36,479 --> 01:09:39,519
<i>A most uncomfortable screw
But I fuck the princess too</i>

873
01:09:41,159 --> 01:09:42,959
<i>Who's that ringing on my bell?</i>

874
01:09:43,159 --> 01:09:44,839
<i>The bitch who's fucking Iron Man</i>

875
01:09:45,039 --> 01:09:49,599
<i>That's l-R-O-N M-A-N
And I fuck him in the mouth</i>

876
01:09:49,799 --> 01:09:53,159
<i>That's fucking great
Because I'm fucking Wolf</i>

877
01:09:55,519 --> 01:09:57,079
<i>He's fucking Wolf
Ain't that a pity?</i>

878
01:09:57,279 --> 01:10:00,479
<i>Because I'm fucking those bitches
From Sex and the City</i>

879
01:10:01,839 --> 01:10:04,679
<i>He fucks the Sex and the City gals</i>

880
01:10:04,879 --> 01:10:07,559
So I wondered:
Would Wolf really get jealous...

881
01:10:07,759 --> 01:10:10,639
...if he knew we were fucking
that guy with the big utility belt?

882
01:10:12,159 --> 01:10:13,359
<i>They're all fucking Batman</i>

883
01:10:13,559 --> 01:10:16,639
<i>At Wayne Manor, in the Batcave
Butler Alfred is our love slave</i>

884
01:10:16,799 --> 01:10:18,439
<i>Riddle me this
Holy bathhouse</i>

885
01:10:18,639 --> 01:10:20,079
<i>I'm fucking Amy Winehouse?</i>

886
01:10:20,279 --> 01:10:23,439
<i>He's fucking Amy Winehouse</i>

887
01:10:23,639 --> 01:10:26,119
<i>Yeah, on the down-low, low, low</i>

888
01:10:26,319 --> 01:10:29,119
<i>And I'm fucking Jessica Simpson</i>

889
01:10:29,839 --> 01:10:32,879
<i>'Cause I'm on blow, blow, blow</i>

890
01:10:33,079 --> 01:10:36,879
<i>She's fucking Jessica Simpson
Oh, yeah</i>

891
01:10:37,079 --> 01:10:40,919
<i>And I think I might have fucked
That hot assassin</i>

892
01:10:41,119 --> 01:10:44,159
<i>Everyone's fucked me
And I've fucked them back, you see</i>

893
01:10:44,359 --> 01:10:47,559
<i>And the Mexican too
With the tragic hairdo</i>

894
01:10:47,999 --> 01:10:50,799
<i>Call it, heads, I'm fucking J. T.</i>

895
01:10:50,999 --> 01:10:53,799
<i>I'm fucking that male model
'Cause he's so fine</i>

896
01:10:53,999 --> 01:10:56,999
<i>And I like to get up
In them Calvin Kleins</i>

897
01:10:57,199 --> 01:11:03,319
<i>It's true, J. T. Fucked my ass again
But I'm also fucking Prince Caspian</i>

898
01:11:03,839 --> 01:11:06,879
<i>I am handsome and I am cool</i>

899
01:11:07,079 --> 01:11:10,159
<i>That's why this prince
Fucks the kids from high school</i>

900
01:11:13,879 --> 01:11:15,319
<i>- Come on

901
01:11:15,519 --> 01:11:17,359
<i>- Now's the time to party
- Let me hear you</i>

902
01:11:17,559 --> 01:11:19,639
<i>- You know what time it is?
- No, what time is it?</i>

903
01:11:19,839 --> 01:11:21,679
<i>- It's time to get fucked
- Fuck me</i>

904
01:11:21,879 --> 01:11:23,839
<i>- No, fuck me
- Fuck me</i>

905
01:11:24,039 --> 01:11:25,919
<i>He fucks all us kids in high school</i>

906
01:11:26,079 --> 01:11:29,879
<i>Under the bleachers, in the showers
While we're changing for gym class</i>

907
01:11:30,079 --> 01:11:31,839
<i>- I'm fucking Oprah

<i>And I'm fucking Michael Jackson</i>

913
01:11:49,119 --> 01:11:51,999
<i>Don't judge me
I love my animals, you see</i>

914
01:11:52,199 --> 01:11:53,879
<i>Oh, yeah, he's fucking the Chipmunks</i>

915
01:11:54,079 --> 01:11:57,479
<i>Sad to say, but it's true
He fucks the Chipmunks, yeah</i>

916
01:14:17,719 --> 01:14:19,279
You just got Wolfed.

917
01:14:19,479 --> 01:14:22,239
That's a little move I learned in jail.

918
01:14:22,439 --> 01:14:23,799
Yeah, I was in jail.

919
01:14:23,999 --> 01:14:26,439
Wolf wrote some bad checks in '95.

920
01:14:26,639 --> 01:14:28,679
Left foot, yellow.

921
01:14:29,959 --> 01:14:31,279
Oh, that's right, I fall.

922
01:14:31,745 --> 01:14:32,945
I am Beowulf.

923
01:14:33,145 --> 01:14:36,585
I'm the strongest man
in seven kingdoms.

924
01:14:38,305 --> 01:14:40,745
Let myself go a little bit.

925
01:14:40,945 --> 01:14:42,705
Got a little bit flabby.

926
01:14:42,905 --> 01:14:44,745
I went on that Zone Diet...

927
01:14:44,945 --> 01:14:49,505
...but I would eat like a whole week's
worth of meals in like two days...

928
01:14:49,705 --> 01:14:51,225
...and then be back to square one.

929
01:14:51,425 --> 01:14:55,305
If you've got crack anywhere,
I don't care where it comes from...

930
01:14:55,505 --> 01:14:58,825
If it's in your crack...
If the crack's in your crack.

931
01:15:00,305 --> 01:15:03,465
"If the crack's in your crack."
Oh, that's rich.

932
01:15:03,825 --> 01:15:05,745
You ever been
with a bald doctor before?

933
01:15:05,945 --> 01:15:07,945
- No.
- We give better...

934
01:15:09,905 --> 01:15:11,945
Do I look like Harrison Ford to you?

935
01:15:12,145 --> 01:15:14,265
- He your pimp?
- Oh, good heavens, yes.

936
01:15:17,905 --> 01:15:20,185
Oh, what to do? Yes, I've got it.

937
01:15:20,385 --> 01:15:23,705
You can be my prince of light,
and you can be my prince of darkness.

938
01:15:23,905 --> 01:15:25,665
- Yes. No? Okay.
- No.

939
01:15:26,545 --> 01:15:28,585
Left foot, yellow.

940
01:15:29,554 --> 01:15:31,874
I got us tickets
to Madonna's reunion show...

941
01:15:32,074 --> 01:15:34,194
...and then I wanna
kiss your sweet face.

942
01:15:34,394 --> 01:15:36,034
No!

943
01:15:37,194 --> 01:15:39,194
Take it from the top again.
She says, "Hello."

944
01:15:39,394 --> 01:15:42,114
Don't hit her so hard.
Just hit her really lightly.

945
01:15:42,274 --> 01:15:43,674
Okay?

946
01:15:44,354 --> 01:15:45,674
Good enough for me.

947
01:15:47,354 --> 01:15:48,994
It's all very funny.

948
01:15:49,794 --> 01:15:51,194
Cut.

949
01:15:51,834 --> 01:15:55,394
Oh, it's my Blake, incarcerated.
Hi, Blakey.

950
01:15:55,594 --> 01:15:57,914
How are you? I love you.

951
01:15:58,114 --> 01:15:59,874
He did not kill those three prostitutes.

952
01:16:00,034 --> 01:16:03,874
They were already dead when he
got to them. I'm swearing to God.

953
01:16:04,354 --> 01:16:07,274
Look, I have to tell you something.
I'm not really a banker.

954
01:16:07,474 --> 01:16:09,034
As my voice cracks.

955
01:16:09,234 --> 01:16:14,074
Look, I have something to tell you.
I'm not really a banker. I'm a jumper.

956
01:16:14,274 --> 01:16:17,514
I can teleport through space and time.

957
01:16:20,714 --> 01:16:22,994
- What is it again? Time and space.
- Time and space.

958
01:16:23,394 --> 01:16:24,914
Look, I have something to tell you.

959
01:16:25,114 --> 01:16:27,194
I'm not really a banker. I'm a jumper.

960
01:16:27,394 --> 01:16:30,274
- A what?
- I can teleport through time...

961
01:16:39,949 --> 01:16:46,509
Hey, is my singing stick on?
It is on? Is the singing stick on?

962
01:16:49,109 --> 01:16:52,269
You know, everyone wants to know
where I got my:

963
01:16:52,469 --> 01:16:55,389
It all started one night
when I was crying in my truck.

964
01:16:55,589 --> 01:16:58,389
Yeah. I ain't crying no more, man.

965
01:16:58,549 --> 01:17:00,469
Fourteenth highest-rated show on TV.

966
01:17:00,669 --> 01:17:03,469
I got a time-share in Key West.

967
01:17:04,149 --> 01:17:08,229
<i>Oh, baby, I make shoes</i>

968
01:17:08,429 --> 01:17:12,149
<i>And these are my boobs</i>

969
01:17:12,309 --> 01:17:14,469
I want you to see me
in my birthday suit.

970
01:17:14,669 --> 01:17:16,789
I want you to watch me
take a bubble bath.

971
01:17:16,989 --> 01:17:19,749
I'm gonna play around with the bubbles
and make a little beard.

972
01:17:19,949 --> 01:17:21,789
Pretend I'm Santa Claus.

973
01:17:23,109 --> 01:17:25,709
Oh, son, I'm loving this.

974
01:17:38,350 --> 01:17:40,070
Wonderful!

975
01:17:41,110 --> 01:17:43,110
I'd like to get you naked
and analyze you.

976
01:17:43,310 --> 01:17:45,350
Oh, shit.

977
01:17:45,550 --> 01:17:47,870
Do you like this shirt?
I totally made it myself.

978
01:17:48,070 --> 01:17:50,550
Well, it's because I ripped it.
It's because I burned it.

979
01:17:50,750 --> 01:17:52,390
I was leaning over my birthday candles.

980
01:17:52,550 --> 01:17:54,230
I was gonna blow them out,
make a wish.

981
01:17:54,430 --> 01:17:55,990
Instead my shirt caught on fire.

982
01:17:56,390 --> 01:17:59,950
Son, if you go back for your girlfriend,
you have zero chance of survival.

983
01:18:00,270 --> 01:18:02,150
I'll take those odds.

984
01:18:03,310 --> 01:18:05,190
Do you hear that train?

985
01:18:07,430 --> 01:18:11,030
Son, if you go back for your girlfriend,
you have zero chance of survival.

986
01:18:11,230 --> 01:18:12,830
I'll take those odds.

987
01:18:13,030 --> 01:18:16,070
You hear that train again?
You hear that again, that second time?

988
01:18:16,470 --> 01:18:20,070
Son, if you go back for your girlfriend,
you have zero chance of survival.

989
01:18:20,510 --> 01:18:21,510
I'll take those...

990
01:18:21,710 --> 01:18:24,070
Train. I knew it was coming too. Yeah.

991
01:18:24,270 --> 01:18:27,910
- Is that the train we should catch?
- No, no. Take a...

992
01:18:30,510 --> 01:18:31,470
Couple more?

993
01:18:31,670 --> 01:18:34,430
You're hot. Are those things real?

994
01:18:36,350 --> 01:18:40,390
Hey, everybody, be sure to remember
to always use Proactiv. It helped me.

995
01:18:40,550 --> 01:18:45,030
<i>It helped my skin
It helped my skin</i>

996
01:18:45,230 --> 01:18:50,670
<i>It helped my skin
It helped my skin, baby</i>

997
01:18:50,870 --> 01:18:54,110
It helped me. I used to have it
all around this part of my face...

998
01:18:54,310 --> 01:18:56,030
...and all around my talking hole...

999
01:18:56,230 --> 01:18:59,550
...and then out of this squishy part
right here.

1000
01:18:59,750 --> 01:19:02,110
I had it everywhere, and now it's gone.

1001
01:19:03,911 --> 01:19:06,471
Oh, this is my jam.

1002
01:19:06,972 --> 01:19:09,472
Oh, okay. You get on it.

1003
01:19:10,400 --> 01:23:36,472
