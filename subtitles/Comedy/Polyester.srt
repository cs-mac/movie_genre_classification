1
00:00:19,786 --> 00:00:21,129
Hello, moviegoers.

2
00:00:21,154 --> 00:00:23,327
I am Dr. Arnold Quackenshaw.

3
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:25,337
I'm here to explain to you...

4
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:29,136
the wondrous screen gimmick,
Odorama.

5
00:00:29,162 --> 00:00:32,234
Odorama will enable you,
the viewer...

6
00:00:32,266 --> 00:00:35,907
to actually smell,
right from your movie seat...

7
00:00:35,936 --> 00:00:40,214
some of life's
most fragrant odors.

8
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,584
The producers of this film...

9
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:47,058
have unselfishly spent
untold millions of dollars...

10
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:50,027
to develop
this startling process.

11
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:54,328
And I, I have been locked away
for many years...

12
00:00:54,354 --> 00:00:56,061
in the laboratory...

13
00:00:56,089 --> 00:01:00,560
experimenting
with this mind-boggling project.

14
00:01:00,594 --> 00:01:05,543
I would like to share with you
some of my research.

15
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:08,069
All right, first of all...

16
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:11,173
this...is the nose.

17
00:01:11,204 --> 00:01:13,411
The most prominent part
of the human face.

18
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:17,217
It bears the nostrils
und covers the nasal passages.

19
00:01:17,244 --> 00:01:22,057
We all have one, this nose,
call it what you will--

20
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:27,122
sneezer, schnoz, beak,
smeller, snout, schnootâ€œ

21
00:01:27,154 --> 00:01:28,656
it all means the same thing.

22
00:01:28,689 --> 00:01:30,259
Through this nose...

23
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:33,396
comes some of life's
most rewarding sensations...

24
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:35,600
und we plan to share with you...

25
00:01:35,629 --> 00:01:39,839
some of the most beautiful odors
known to mankind.

26
00:01:39,866 --> 00:01:42,972
Unfortunately, this same nose...

27
00:01:43,003 --> 00:01:46,644
is also responsible
for bringing us some odors...

28
00:01:46,673 --> 00:01:49,415
that are rather repulsive.

29
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:54,017
We have not shied away
from this distressing fact.

30
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:58,860
You will experience some odors
that may shock you...

31
00:01:58,885 --> 00:02:00,762
but the producers
of this film...

32
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:04,360
believe that today's audiences
are mature enough...

33
00:02:04,391 --> 00:02:07,736
to accept the fact
that some things in life...

34
00:02:07,761 --> 00:02:11,038
just plain stink.

35
00:02:11,064 --> 00:02:13,635
All right, now,
this is the product...

36
00:02:13,667 --> 00:02:15,943
of our endless
experimentation...

37
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:18,882
the Odorama card.

38
00:02:18,905 --> 00:02:21,545
The card is actually
quite simple to operate.

39
00:02:21,575 --> 00:02:24,681
Just listen carefully
und follow my instructions.

40
00:02:24,711 --> 00:02:27,817
When a number appears
on the screen...

41
00:02:27,848 --> 00:02:31,819
that is your signal
to scratch and to sniff...

42
00:02:31,852 --> 00:02:34,924
the same number
on your Odorama card.

43
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:39,195
Use anything you want
to scratch it.

44
00:02:39,226 --> 00:02:42,264
Use a key, a coin.
Use your fingernail.

45
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:44,536
Number one...

46
00:02:44,564 --> 00:02:46,441
Now, sniff it, number one.

47
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:48,309
You get it? You smell it?

48
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:51,942
It works.
By God, it actually works!

49
00:02:51,972 --> 00:02:57,046
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is Odorama.

50
00:06:07,934 --> 00:06:11,381
Down with smut!
Down with smut!

51
00:06:20,347 --> 00:06:22,554
The porno king!

52
00:06:24,184 --> 00:06:28,030
Smut king! You bought this house
with the profits of porno!

53
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:34,931
Children are going to hell
because of your theater.

54
00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:36,304
What have you got to say to him?

55
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:38,309
Children under 12, $1.50.

56
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:41,107
Please show "Benji"!
Please show G-rated movies!

57
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:42,909
Garbage and filth!

58
00:06:42,936 --> 00:06:45,075
Elmer, thank God you're home.

59
00:06:45,105 --> 00:06:48,018
Get off of me! Why haven't you
notified the press?

60
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:49,384
Think of the publicity!

61
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,650
The theater will be packed
tomorrow night.

62
00:06:51,678 --> 00:06:54,284
Please don't call the press.
It's bad enough already.

63
00:06:54,314 --> 00:06:57,727
All the neighborhood women
spit at me in the shopping mall.

64
00:06:57,751 --> 00:07:00,891
You wouldn't be in the mall
if it wasn't for my theater.

65
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:02,923
Hello? Channel 12 News?

66
00:07:02,956 --> 00:07:06,597
This is Elmer Fishpaw,
538 Wyman Way.

67
00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:08,765
I'm the owner
of the Charles Art Theater.

68
00:07:08,795 --> 00:07:11,867
You might want to send
a mini-cam crew to my home.

69
00:07:11,898 --> 00:07:13,707
Mini-cam?! Elmer, please!

70
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:14,973
The Citizens for Decent Films...

71
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:17,538
are violently demonstrating
on my front lawn.

72
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:19,641
Filth!

73
00:07:19,673 --> 00:07:21,778
Elmer, there are more of them
out there.

74
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:24,186
I'll never be able
to show my face in church again!

75
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:26,952
I'll be excommunicated
because of you!

76
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:29,358
Stop that yammering
and fix me a drink.

77
00:07:29,382 --> 00:07:31,362
- What do we love?
- Decency!

78
00:07:31,384 --> 00:07:33,887
- What do we hate?
- Filth!

79
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,866
Down with smut!

80
00:07:35,889 --> 00:07:38,563
Here, Bonkers.

81
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:41,265
Here's little Bonkers.

82
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:43,672
Bonkers is Daddy's little baby.

83
00:07:43,697 --> 00:07:47,907
Bonkers knows who's boss
in this house.

84
00:07:47,934 --> 00:07:49,504
Give me a little kiss, Bonkers.

85
00:07:49,536 --> 00:07:53,211
That a little doggie.
Little doggie!

86
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:55,116
You are so cute, Bonkers.

87
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:57,382
Elmer,
that dog stinks to high heaven.

88
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:59,651
You'll be permeated by his odor.

89
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:04,355
Well, this whole world stinks,
so get used to it.

90
00:08:04,384 --> 00:08:06,125
You and that big nose
of yours...

91
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:08,496
are starting
to get on my nerves.

92
00:08:08,521 --> 00:08:11,559
Snorting around the place
like a goddamn anteater.

93
00:08:11,591 --> 00:08:14,868
I've about had it with you.
Give me that drink!

94
00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:16,840
- Yes, dear.
-Hurry up!

95
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,506
- What do we hate?
- Filth!

96
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:28,041
Lu-Lu, dinner's ready!

97
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:31,382
I'll be down in a minute.

98
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:36,691
Dexter, honey,
dinner's on the table.

99
00:08:48,762 --> 00:08:50,742
Elmer, dinner's sewed.

100
00:08:50,764 --> 00:08:53,176
I'm in here waiting for it!

101
00:09:01,408 --> 00:09:04,389
Elmer, let's try and have
a pleasant family dinner.

102
00:09:04,411 --> 00:09:07,392
Let's be kind to the other
members of the family.

103
00:09:07,414 --> 00:09:10,554
I'll try, Francine,
but don't go riling me up.

104
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:13,792
Choose your words with care,
and I won't get riled.

105
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,163
Yes, dear.

106
00:09:15,188 --> 00:09:17,031
Lu-Lu,
your hair looks so pretty.

107
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:18,502
I know.

108
00:09:18,525 --> 00:09:20,129
Dexter,
did you do your homework, honey?

109
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,071
Sure, sure.

110
00:09:23,096 --> 00:09:27,442
Can we say grace?
Can we at least do that?

111
00:09:27,467 --> 00:09:29,913
Bless us, O Lord,
and these Thy gifts...

112
00:09:29,936 --> 00:09:32,883
which we are about
to receive from Thy bounty...

113
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:35,512
through Christ our Lord. Amen.

114
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,352
Don't answer it!

115
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:41,620
It's a TV crew!

116
00:09:41,648 --> 00:09:44,959
I'll handle that.
You all stay here.

117
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:46,986
Mr. Fishpaw,
would you step out, please?

118
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,556
Why, certainly.

119
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:55,029
Mr. Fishpaw, I'm Jerry Haller
from Channel 12 News.

120
00:09:55,061 --> 00:09:56,904
I was wondering,
could you make a comment...

121
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:59,570
on this demonstration against
your X-rated movie theater?

122
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,545
I'll show any movie
I wanna show.

123
00:10:01,568 --> 00:10:03,548
This is a free country,
isn't it?

124
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:06,210
Our current attraction
is "My Burning Bush."

125
00:10:06,239 --> 00:10:10,153
We have shows daily at 2:00,
4:00, 6:00, 8:00, and 10:00!

126
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,890
Leave us alone!
Please, leave us alone!

127
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:18,987
My family hasn't done anything
to you.

128
00:10:20,887 --> 00:10:22,958
I'm a good Christian woman!

129
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:32,441
Two-four-six-eight!

130
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:43,016
All that free publicity.

131
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:45,522
I can't wait to see
the 11:00 news.

132
00:10:45,545 --> 00:10:48,458
- Excuse me? Excuse me?
- What the hell?

133
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:50,620
Excuse me,
my name's Freddy Ashton.

134
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:53,494
I'm sorry if I caught you
at a bad time.

135
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,397
I have a date
with your daughter, Lu-Lu.

136
00:10:55,421 --> 00:10:57,458
She didn't say anything to me
about a date.

137
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,936
- It is a school night.
- Yes, ma'am, I know.

138
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:03,031
We're going to work on
our term papers at the library.

139
00:11:03,062 --> 00:11:04,803
You take care of this, Francine.

140
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:08,108
I'm gonna fix myself a big drink
and get into bed.

141
00:11:08,134 --> 00:11:10,740
I've got a big day
counting money tomorrow.

142
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:12,340
Nice meeting you, Mr. Fishpaw.

143
00:11:12,372 --> 00:11:14,818
Have a nice night!

144
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:18,084
I think it's disgraceful
the way your neighbors act.

145
00:11:18,111 --> 00:11:19,920
Very kind of you to say so,
Freddy.

146
00:11:19,946 --> 00:11:21,584
- Won't you sit down?
- Thank you.

147
00:11:24,751 --> 00:11:26,389
I didn't get your last name?

148
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:28,057
Ashton.

149
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:31,796
You're not by any chance
a friend of Bo-Bo Belsingers?

150
00:11:31,824 --> 00:11:34,600
You see,
Lu-Lu's forbidden to see him.

151
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:36,231
Oh, no, ma'am.

152
00:11:38,097 --> 00:11:41,977
Hi, Freddy.

153
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:43,378
Where did you get that outfit?

154
00:11:43,403 --> 00:11:45,474
I borrowed it.
Do you like it?

155
00:11:45,505 --> 00:11:46,916
That's a new garment, Lu-Lu.

156
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:48,385
I can smell it.

157
00:11:48,408 --> 00:11:50,251
Have you been shoplifting again?

158
00:11:50,276 --> 00:11:52,278
I bought it with money I saved.

159
00:11:52,312 --> 00:11:54,690
What money?
You don't have a job.

160
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,455
Boys at school give me money.

161
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:59,224
- For what?
- For dancing at lunch period!

162
00:11:59,252 --> 00:12:01,562
You dance lewdly for the boys
at lunch period?

163
00:12:01,588 --> 00:12:03,033
For a quarter I will.

164
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:04,626
Stop that dancing!

165
00:12:04,657 --> 00:12:06,432
Don't be upset, Mrs. Fishpaw.

166
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:09,531
Puberty brings on
strange behavior in adolescents.

167
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:12,566
I'll take good care of her.
Have a nice night.

168
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:18,976
Good-bye, children.

169
00:12:19,005 --> 00:12:20,746
Don't be late,
it's a school night.

170
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:22,081
Freddy, drive carefully.

171
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:24,179
Lu-Lu, you have fifteen cents
to call home--

172
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:26,417
l sure do!

173
00:12:26,446 --> 00:12:29,518
Well, be a good girl. Bye!

174
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:35,092
Lu-Lu, you look so nice tonight.

175
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:37,192
Freddy, you're so polite.

176
00:12:42,795 --> 00:12:45,867
We're gonna have such fun.

177
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:52,675
OK, bird-brain,
it's gonna cost you ten bucks.

178
00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:54,548
Pull down by the golf course.

179
00:12:54,574 --> 00:12:57,248
Lu-Lu, don't try to shock me,
'cause it's not gonna work.

180
00:12:57,277 --> 00:12:59,018
We're going to the library
to study.

181
00:12:59,045 --> 00:13:02,083
Too cheap?
Come on, get moving!

182
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:04,095
Lu-Lu, stay on your side!

183
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:07,758
Give it some gas!

184
00:13:16,663 --> 00:13:19,269
See you later, chump.

185
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:22,872
Bo-Bo!

186
00:13:27,373 --> 00:13:30,513
Lu-Lu, we'd better be
getting to the library.

187
00:13:30,543 --> 00:13:34,252
You ain't going anywhere
with this little lady, faggot!

188
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,624
I believe I had a date with her,
Bo-Bo.

189
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,356
Get lost, moron!

190
00:13:42,355 --> 00:13:43,959
See you later, Freddy!

191
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,765
Go on! Get out of here!

192
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,273
Yeah, shake it all!
Come on, get down!

193
00:13:50,296 --> 00:13:51,673
Hot damn,yeah!

194
00:13:51,698 --> 00:13:52,972
Shake it, Lu-Lu!

195
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:54,774
Let's go!

196
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:59,106
Come on, yeah.

197
00:13:59,138 --> 00:14:02,051
Come on, girl.

198
00:14:02,075 --> 00:14:04,578
Look what I got.

199
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:05,645
All right!

200
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:08,750
Let's go downtown
and play some pool!

201
00:14:38,578 --> 00:14:39,955
White honky!

202
00:14:39,979 --> 00:14:41,686
You crazy cracker!

203
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,955
What's wrong with these children
of today?

204
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:47,089
Don't he know he just hit one
of the sisters of the church?

205
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:51,330
I'm sick and tired of what
these children are doing--

206
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:59,439
Police!

207
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:44,679
I don't know what's happening!

208
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:46,018
Let's get out of here!

209
00:15:49,148 --> 00:15:50,650
Help!

210
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:52,754
I didn't do nothing!

211
00:15:59,091 --> 00:16:02,231
Don't stop.

212
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:04,400
Baltimore Police
today reported...

213
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:07,877
they had no suspects in
the Baltimore Foot-Stomper Case.

214
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:10,380
Described as a thin,
white teenage male...

215
00:16:10,403 --> 00:16:12,576
the stomper struck twice
this week...

216
00:16:12,605 --> 00:16:15,518
seriously injuring the feet
of two Baltimore women.

217
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:17,043
Come on! Where's my footage?

218
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:18,214
Miss Betty Lazinski...

219
00:16:18,244 --> 00:16:20,087
a waitress at the White
Coffee Pot Restaurant...

220
00:16:20,112 --> 00:16:22,114
was released
from the hospital today...

221
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:24,594
and talked with Channel 12 News.

222
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:27,893
Some people think
this is funny...

223
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,423
but I have three broken toes
to show for it.

224
00:16:30,456 --> 00:16:32,060
Did the stomper say anything?

225
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:34,093
Come on! Come on!
Where's my footage?!

226
00:16:34,126 --> 00:16:36,970
He didn't say nothing.
He just stomped on my foot!

227
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:40,170
- In other news...
- Shut up! Here it is.

228
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:43,146
...picketed the home
of Mr. Elmer Fishpaw today.

229
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:45,581
Mr. Fishpaw is the owner
of the Charles Art Theater...

230
00:16:45,605 --> 00:16:47,585
a local X-rated movie house.

231
00:16:47,607 --> 00:16:52,078
Two-four-six-eight,
X-rated movies we all hate!

232
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:56,992
One-three-five-nine,
G-rated movies are mighty fine!

233
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,826
The pickets, led by Mrs.
Jeanette Smise of Townsend...

234
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:02,355
feel he should
change the theater's policy...

235
00:17:02,388 --> 00:17:05,631
by showing only G-rated
family movies.

236
00:17:05,658 --> 00:17:08,969
His theater
caters to sex offenders.

237
00:17:08,995 --> 00:17:11,999
We visited
the Charles Art Theater today...

238
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:14,272
but were unable
to find a ticket buyer...

239
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:17,338
willing to be interviewed
on camera.

240
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:20,010
Sir, would you like to comment
on the movie you've just seen?

241
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:22,645
Excuse me. Would you like
to comment on the movie?

242
00:17:22,675 --> 00:17:24,655
Excuse me, sir.
Pardon me, sir, would--

243
00:17:24,677 --> 00:17:26,782
Pardon me, sir, would you like
to comment on the movie?

244
00:17:26,812 --> 00:17:30,089
Mr. Fishpaw when contacted
by Channel 12 News...

245
00:17:30,116 --> 00:17:31,390
Here I am!

246
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:32,953
...responded to the protesters.

247
00:17:32,985 --> 00:17:35,659
I think that my theater
helps stop rape.

248
00:17:35,688 --> 00:17:39,898
Mrs. Fishpaw, however,
refused to talk with reporters.

249
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:45,705
I've never been so humiliated.

250
00:17:47,667 --> 00:17:48,941
In other news...

251
00:17:48,968 --> 00:17:51,608
a member of the Charles Manson
Family escaped today...

252
00:17:51,637 --> 00:17:53,639
from the California
Institute for Women...

253
00:17:53,673 --> 00:17:55,050
at Frontera, California.

254
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,052
That's all?!

255
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:57,145
She was identified as--

256
00:17:57,176 --> 00:17:58,985
They didn't even
give the showtime.

257
00:17:59,011 --> 00:18:01,355
I have never been
so embarrassed.

258
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,382
Yellow journalism,
that's what it is.

259
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:05,919
Oh, God. It's not fair.

260
00:18:05,952 --> 00:18:07,761
What the hell are you doing?

261
00:18:07,787 --> 00:18:09,357
Saying my prayers, Elmer.

262
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:12,961
Asking God to forgive you
for showing dirty movies.

263
00:18:12,992 --> 00:18:14,562
I don't believe this.

264
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:17,074
I got a goddamn nun for a wife.

265
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:29,549
I'm not in the mood.

266
00:19:02,008 --> 00:19:04,079
Oh, Sandra.

267
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:08,422
Oh, Sandra!
Easy, San--

268
00:19:08,447 --> 00:19:09,790
Easy, Sandra!

269
00:19:40,613 --> 00:19:43,321
The White Tables Motel?!

270
00:19:58,698 --> 00:20:02,077
Get up, Francine, you big oaf!
I want some breakfast.

271
00:20:02,101 --> 00:20:03,205
What time is it?

272
00:20:03,235 --> 00:20:06,182
Time to get that fat ass
out of bed.

273
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:09,209
I guess I'll have
to fix my own cereal!

274
00:20:12,945 --> 00:20:15,289
- You pig!
-You're the pig!

275
00:20:16,415 --> 00:20:17,860
Sit up straight.

276
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:22,160
Why don't you
let that hair grow, boy?

277
00:20:22,188 --> 00:20:24,759
You look like a fruit
with that short hair.

278
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:26,098
Why don't you drop dead?

279
00:20:27,293 --> 00:20:29,273
You're just asking for it.

280
00:20:30,629 --> 00:20:33,337
How's my baby doing in school?

281
00:20:33,365 --> 00:20:37,643
I learned all about my cervix
in sex education class.

282
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:39,149
I gotta go-

283
00:20:39,171 --> 00:20:40,548
Me, too.

284
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:47,247
Good morning, darling.

285
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:48,986
I don't know why
I slept so late.

286
00:20:49,014 --> 00:20:51,392
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
See you later.

287
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:53,158
I got a busy day.

288
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:54,892
Oh, Elmer!

289
00:21:11,737 --> 00:21:13,410
Francine!

290
00:21:15,141 --> 00:21:17,382
I'm in the little girl's room,
Mother.

291
00:21:25,818 --> 00:21:27,422
Can't you do that later?

292
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:29,126
I don't have all day, you know.

293
00:21:29,155 --> 00:21:31,601
I'm missing
valuable shopping time.

294
00:21:31,624 --> 00:21:33,763
Mother, please,
I'll be out in a second.

295
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:36,103
I don't know why you bother.

296
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:39,701
You've always retained
your fluids.

297
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:50,810
Hello, Mother.

298
00:21:52,411 --> 00:21:54,322
Good Lord, Francine.

299
00:21:54,346 --> 00:21:57,225
You've put on
another twenty pounds!

300
00:21:57,249 --> 00:22:00,059
Au revoir, Heintz.

301
00:22:00,085 --> 00:22:03,931
Should I go to the Laundromat
now, Madame, or wait for you?

302
00:22:03,956 --> 00:22:08,029
You can go now, Heintz.
I'll...if I need you.

303
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:09,903
As you wish, Madame.

304
00:22:09,929 --> 00:22:11,169
It's Cuddles.

305
00:22:11,197 --> 00:22:12,642
Good Lord, Francine.

306
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:14,110
Don't you know it's bad luck...

307
00:22:14,133 --> 00:22:15,737
to let retarded people
in your home?

308
00:22:15,768 --> 00:22:17,145
Call me a cab,this instant.

309
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:18,910
But, Mother,
she's my best friend.

310
00:22:18,938 --> 00:22:20,474
Your best friend?!

311
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:23,248
She was your cleaning lady,
Francine.

312
00:22:23,275 --> 00:22:24,982
Are you that unpopular...

313
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:28,082
that you seek out
the social company of your maid?

314
00:22:28,113 --> 00:22:29,751
But she's not a maid anymore,
Mother.

315
00:22:29,782 --> 00:22:31,261
She inherited
a great deal of money...

316
00:22:31,283 --> 00:22:32,956
from a family
she used to work for.

317
00:22:32,985 --> 00:22:36,558
Money or not--
The injustice of it all!

318
00:22:36,589 --> 00:22:38,535
She was a scrub woman!

319
00:22:38,557 --> 00:22:41,470
Give her car fare,
a ham at Easter...

320
00:22:41,493 --> 00:22:44,804
but for God's sakes,
don't hang around with her!

321
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:47,333
Are you going to call me a cab,
or do I have to walk?

322
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:48,640
Yes, Mother.

323
00:22:52,738 --> 00:22:54,877
Good God.

324
00:22:54,907 --> 00:22:56,614
Hi, Francine.

325
00:22:56,642 --> 00:22:57,780
Hi, Cuddles.

326
00:22:57,810 --> 00:22:59,721
You remember my mother, La Rue?

327
00:22:59,745 --> 00:23:01,190
Enchante.

328
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:04,285
Well, well, well.
Off work so early?

329
00:23:04,316 --> 00:23:06,853
Scrubbed out
any interesting toilets lately?

330
00:23:06,886 --> 00:23:07,864
Mother, please.

331
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:09,423
Thank God, my cab.

332
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:16,363
Cuddles,
I'm so glad you're here.

333
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:19,342
Francine,
I'm in a heavenly mood today.

334
00:23:19,365 --> 00:23:23,006
I just got my second installment
of my inheritance.

335
00:23:23,035 --> 00:23:25,242
Let's celebrate.

336
00:23:25,271 --> 00:23:27,877
That calls for a big lunch.

337
00:23:27,907 --> 00:23:30,888
Yummy,yummy,yummy!

338
00:23:33,779 --> 00:23:38,023
This house is just like
"Architectural Digest."

339
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:39,791
Thank you, Cuddles.

340
00:23:39,818 --> 00:23:42,765
Cuddles,
I've been so depressed lately.

341
00:23:42,788 --> 00:23:45,325
You should get out more.

342
00:23:45,357 --> 00:23:48,827
Bachelor cotillions,
parties, country clubs.

343
00:23:48,861 --> 00:23:50,863
I've been on top
of the world lately...

344
00:23:50,896 --> 00:23:53,103
with my debutante party
coming up.

345
00:23:53,132 --> 00:23:55,840
Cuddles, you're too old
to be a debutante.

346
00:23:55,868 --> 00:23:57,905
Just because you've inherited
a lot of money...

347
00:23:57,937 --> 00:24:00,577
doesn't mean that you're
suddenly socially prominent.

348
00:24:00,606 --> 00:24:03,280
I've already rented the hall,
Francine.

349
00:24:03,309 --> 00:24:05,016
November the 10th.

350
00:24:05,044 --> 00:24:07,820
It will be a beautiful affair.

351
00:24:07,846 --> 00:24:10,725
Every little detail
will be perfect.

352
00:24:10,749 --> 00:24:12,660
I wish I could be
more like you, Cuddles.

353
00:24:12,685 --> 00:24:14,426
Always optimistic.

354
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:18,629
I look into my future and all
I see is a long, dark highway...

355
00:24:18,657 --> 00:24:21,934
filled with endless
toll booths and no exits.

356
00:24:21,961 --> 00:24:23,838
I'll be quite blunt with you,
Cuddles.

357
00:24:23,862 --> 00:24:26,775
I think my marriage
is on the rocks.

358
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:34,075
Hello, Mrs. Fishpaw?

359
00:24:34,106 --> 00:24:36,882
This is Sandra Sullivan,
your husband's secretary.

360
00:24:36,909 --> 00:24:38,547
Elmer asked me
to let you know...

361
00:24:38,577 --> 00:24:40,113
that he won't
be coming home tonight.

362
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:42,022
He's been called
out of town on business.

363
00:24:42,047 --> 00:24:44,721
I see. Thank you.

364
00:24:53,726 --> 00:24:55,865
She fell for it.

365
00:24:55,894 --> 00:24:58,636
Oh, God,
what she must look like.

366
00:24:58,664 --> 00:25:00,075
Want to see a picture of her?

367
00:25:00,099 --> 00:25:02,204
Oh, God, yes.

368
00:25:02,234 --> 00:25:03,679
This I got to see.

369
00:25:03,702 --> 00:25:05,147
The bitter truth.

370
00:25:07,306 --> 00:25:10,185
Elmer, she's an absolute cow!

371
00:25:14,446 --> 00:25:17,893
Elmer,
I have something to show you.

372
00:25:19,818 --> 00:25:22,059
You know what these are?

373
00:25:22,087 --> 00:25:25,159
Yes, sirree.
Oral contraceptives.

374
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:29,400
They'll suppress
my ovulations through hormones.

375
00:25:29,428 --> 00:25:33,171
I got something for you, Sandra.

376
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:35,769
I got condoms.

377
00:25:35,801 --> 00:25:38,042
Red-hot prophylactics.

378
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:40,812
Black, your favorite color.

379
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:43,410
Oh, go, honey!

380
00:25:43,442 --> 00:25:45,854
Oh, Elmer, you do that so good.

381
00:25:45,878 --> 00:25:49,416
Come on, honey.
Move for me, baby.

382
00:25:49,448 --> 00:25:53,658
Maybe he really did
go out of town, Francine.

383
00:25:53,685 --> 00:25:56,928
No, he's having an affair
with his secretary...

384
00:25:56,955 --> 00:25:58,400
and I have the proof.

385
00:25:58,424 --> 00:26:00,404
Look what l found in his pocket.

386
00:26:00,426 --> 00:26:03,270
A Mastercharge receipt,
dated yesterday.

387
00:26:03,295 --> 00:26:06,572
From the White Gables Motel!

388
00:26:06,598 --> 00:26:09,238
I'll get it, Francine.

389
00:26:09,268 --> 00:26:11,111
Ello-hay?

390
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:14,080
Old-hay on-ay.

391
00:26:14,106 --> 00:26:15,847
For you, Francine.

392
00:26:20,879 --> 00:26:23,553
Mrs. Fishpaw?
This is Mr. Kirk...

393
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:25,357
principal of Overlee
Junior High School.

394
00:26:25,384 --> 00:26:26,920
Hello, Mr. Kirk.

395
00:26:26,952 --> 00:26:28,693
Is Dexter ill today?

396
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,700
Why, no, Mr. Kirk.
Dexter's in school.

397
00:26:30,722 --> 00:26:33,225
I'm afraid he's not,
Mrs. Fishpaw.

398
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:36,603
Dexter's truancy problem
is way out of hand.

399
00:26:36,628 --> 00:26:38,073
And the Baltimore
County School Board...

400
00:26:38,097 --> 00:26:39,770
have decided to expel Dexter...

401
00:26:39,798 --> 00:26:41,675
from the entire
public school system.

402
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:45,273
I'm as upset as you
to learn of Dexter's truancy.

403
00:26:45,304 --> 00:26:48,012
But surely expulsion
is not the answer!

404
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:50,247
I'm afraid expulsion
is the only answer.

405
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:52,050
It is the opinion
of the entire staff...

406
00:26:52,077 --> 00:26:54,353
that Dexter
is criminally insane...

407
00:26:54,379 --> 00:26:56,689
and a hazard to the safety
of the other students.

408
00:26:56,715 --> 00:26:59,252
We have no choice. I'm sorry.

409
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:00,695
Good day, Mrs. Fishpaw.

410
00:27:07,526 --> 00:27:09,665
Dexter's been expelled
from school!

411
00:27:09,695 --> 00:27:12,266
- For what?
- For truancy!

412
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:15,335
It's just those common
Baltimore public schools.

413
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:17,973
God, I wished
I lived in Connecticut.

414
00:27:18,003 --> 00:27:20,916
The principal said
that he was insane!

415
00:27:20,939 --> 00:27:24,011
He's probably out playing polo
with his friends.

416
00:27:24,042 --> 00:27:28,422
Do you think there is something
wrong with my son?

417
00:28:17,329 --> 00:28:19,434
God!

418
00:28:19,464 --> 00:28:21,569
Help!

419
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:25,571
Oh, my God! Help!

420
00:28:25,604 --> 00:28:27,948
Is anybody gonna help me?!

421
00:28:29,074 --> 00:28:31,384
If my son
does have emotional problems...

422
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:34,414
I can only blame Elmer.

423
00:28:34,446 --> 00:28:37,757
Cuddles, go to
the White Gables Motel for me...

424
00:28:37,783 --> 00:28:40,525
call me if you see his car.

425
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:44,261
You mean like a SPY, Francine?

426
00:28:44,289 --> 00:28:47,065
You got yourself a deal!

427
00:28:49,127 --> 00:28:50,629
Ach, my goodness.

428
00:29:07,779 --> 00:29:11,226
Hurry, Heintz.
Emergency, emergency.

429
00:29:12,951 --> 00:29:14,328
Hurry, Heintz.

430
00:29:16,321 --> 00:29:18,130
Don't ask any questions.

431
00:29:18,156 --> 00:29:20,659
Make a fast right.
Circle the block.

432
00:29:20,692 --> 00:29:24,071
Head straight to the White Gable
Motel, and hurry!

433
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:26,303
Yes, ma'am.

434
00:29:26,331 --> 00:29:28,072
Hurry, Heintz.

435
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:33,071
Lu-Lu? Lu-Lu, is that you?

436
00:29:33,105 --> 00:29:36,382
Lu-Lu? Oh. Hi, honey.

437
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:41,781
Oh, Lu-Lu.
Home from school already?

438
00:29:41,813 --> 00:29:43,383
Unfortunately, yes.

439
00:29:43,415 --> 00:29:45,190
Did you have a nice day?

440
00:29:45,217 --> 00:29:47,424
Lu-Lu,
your mother is speaking to you.

441
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:50,262
Did you have a nice day?

442
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:55,295
Lu-Lu!
I'm trying to clean in here!

443
00:29:55,327 --> 00:29:58,035
I got my report card today.
Want to see it?

444
00:29:58,063 --> 00:30:00,339
Have you done any better
this time?

445
00:30:02,534 --> 00:30:06,573
Lu-Lu, you have failed
every single subject again!

446
00:30:06,605 --> 00:30:09,449
No, Ma.
They changed the grading system.

447
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:10,919
"F" is for "Fantastic."

448
00:30:10,942 --> 00:30:12,285
You little liar.

449
00:30:12,311 --> 00:30:14,257
It's a good thing
you're not Pinocchio.

450
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:16,190
Your nose would be a mile long.

451
00:30:16,214 --> 00:30:18,660
I swear to God
on the Bible it's true!

452
00:30:18,684 --> 00:30:20,527
Stop that lying!

453
00:30:20,552 --> 00:30:23,089
I got voted president
of Student Council today.

454
00:30:23,121 --> 00:30:24,099
Liar mouth!

455
00:30:24,122 --> 00:30:26,762
- I'm a cheerleader, too!
- Liar! Liar!

456
00:30:26,792 --> 00:30:28,669
I'll tell you another thing,
Mother.

457
00:30:28,694 --> 00:30:30,230
I quit school today...

458
00:30:30,262 --> 00:30:33,266
and I'm gonna get me a job
as a go-go girl...

459
00:30:33,298 --> 00:30:35,574
down at
the Flaming Cave Lounge.

460
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,581
You'll work at the Flaming Cave
Lounge over my dead body.

461
00:30:38,603 --> 00:30:42,050
You go to your room, and you
stay there until I call you!

462
00:30:47,646 --> 00:30:49,216
I'll work where I wanna work!

463
00:30:49,247 --> 00:30:53,389
You've never worked
a day in your life. Fat cow!

464
00:30:53,418 --> 00:30:56,297
I'm not gonna stay
in this stinking house!

465
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,658
Hi, honey.

466
00:31:22,681 --> 00:31:26,652
Hey, baby. Come here.

467
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:33,396
Come on. Let's get out of here.
I hate this place.

468
00:31:33,425 --> 00:31:34,403
All right.

469
00:31:34,426 --> 00:31:36,201
You're all beat up.

470
00:31:36,228 --> 00:31:38,105
It ain't nothing.

471
00:31:50,342 --> 00:31:52,049
Any sign of him, Heintz?

472
00:31:52,077 --> 00:31:54,489
Not yet, Madame.

473
00:32:07,826 --> 00:32:09,806
You devil, you.

474
00:32:09,828 --> 00:32:11,205
You wait
till I get in that room!

475
00:32:11,229 --> 00:32:13,641
I can't wait, honey.

476
00:32:13,665 --> 00:32:16,544
- I'll be right back.
-You hurry up now.

477
00:32:16,568 --> 00:32:20,778
Heintz,
she's straight from the gutter!

478
00:32:20,806 --> 00:32:23,912
A sporting girl,
I would imagine.

479
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:25,444
A fille de joie!

480
00:32:25,477 --> 00:32:29,391
It saddens me that you have
to see anything this common.

481
00:32:29,414 --> 00:32:35,854
Poor Francine!
Poor, poor Francine!

482
00:32:35,887 --> 00:32:37,423
In other news, James Wemo...

483
00:32:37,456 --> 00:32:39,265
accused of
the August 9th bombing...

484
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:40,827
of the Maryland
Censor Board Office...

485
00:32:40,859 --> 00:32:44,602
has pleaded "not guilty"
in federal court today.

486
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:46,040
And this just in, folks.

487
00:32:47,332 --> 00:32:50,313
The Baltimore Foot Stomper
has struck again.

488
00:32:50,335 --> 00:32:52,246
Baltimore County Police
report...

489
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:54,580
the stomper has attacked
a Mrs. Shirley Evans...

490
00:32:54,606 --> 00:32:57,712
just a few minutes ago
at the Crockfield Mall...

491
00:32:57,742 --> 00:33:00,279
and Channel 12 News was there.

492
00:33:00,312 --> 00:33:02,986
I don't want to be
on television!

493
00:33:03,014 --> 00:33:05,517
My foot! Not now!

494
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:08,030
Mrs. Evans was rushed
to the Mercy Hospital...

495
00:33:08,053 --> 00:33:11,330
Shock Trauma Unit
for emergency treatment.

496
00:33:11,356 --> 00:33:14,462
Many Crockfield Mall
shoppers witnessed the attack.

497
00:33:14,493 --> 00:33:17,064
I seen it, man! I seen
this weird-looking dude...

498
00:33:17,095 --> 00:33:19,871
run right out and stomp
on this honky lady's feet!

499
00:33:19,898 --> 00:33:22,504
Police released
this composite sketch today...

500
00:33:22,534 --> 00:33:25,481
in the hopes that someone
would identify the stomper.

501
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:27,711
If you have any information...

502
00:33:27,739 --> 00:33:31,152
police have asked citizens
to call the Stomper Hot Line.

503
00:33:31,176 --> 00:33:37,218
Just dial "STOMPER."
S-T-O-M-P-E-R.

504
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:11,421
You'll be ready
for the back seat in a minute.

505
00:34:22,227 --> 00:34:24,901
Trash!
Don't you touch my daughter!

506
00:34:24,930 --> 00:34:26,773
Take your hands off
my boyfriend!

507
00:34:26,798 --> 00:34:28,835
That's my car!

508
00:34:28,867 --> 00:34:30,278
Come on!

509
00:34:30,302 --> 00:34:32,179
My God!

510
00:34:32,203 --> 00:34:34,649
Hit her, Bo-Bo! Hit her!

511
00:34:43,114 --> 00:34:46,891
That's what you deserve,
you big, fat galoot!

512
00:34:52,424 --> 00:34:55,530
It was nice beating you,
Mrs. Fishpaw!

513
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:07,648
Dexter, are you all right?

514
00:35:07,672 --> 00:35:09,151
Dexter, what's wrong?

515
00:35:09,174 --> 00:35:10,619
Dexter, talk to me.

516
00:35:10,642 --> 00:35:12,553
Dexter, it's your mother.

517
00:35:12,577 --> 00:35:13,885
Dexter, what is it?

518
00:35:13,912 --> 00:35:17,382
- What's wrong, honey?
- Mom...

519
00:35:17,415 --> 00:35:20,259
Dexter, what are you doing?

520
00:35:23,388 --> 00:35:26,028
Do you want to see
a psychiatrist?

521
00:35:26,057 --> 00:35:27,559
But I love you--

522
00:35:27,592 --> 00:35:28,798
Dexter!

523
00:35:32,163 --> 00:35:33,403
Oh, honey...

524
00:35:40,772 --> 00:35:43,082
You had better watch yourself,
young lady.

525
00:35:43,108 --> 00:35:45,349
You're going to be
in real trouble!

526
00:35:45,377 --> 00:35:49,257
I guess I should tell you
I'm two months pregnant.

527
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,691
You're what?!

528
00:35:50,715 --> 00:35:52,661
I'm knocked up, and that's that!

529
00:35:52,684 --> 00:35:54,220
Who did this to you?

530
00:35:54,252 --> 00:35:57,597
Bo-Bo! The man I love.

531
00:35:57,622 --> 00:36:00,125
I'll never allow you
to marry him.

532
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:02,069
Marry him?! Are you kidding?

533
00:36:02,093 --> 00:36:04,937
I'm getting an abortion,
and I can't wait!

534
00:36:04,963 --> 00:36:06,909
I cannot take
another heartbreak.

535
00:36:06,931 --> 00:36:09,138
I just cannot take it!

536
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:12,273
Do you think I'm made of steel,
Miss Lu-Lu?

537
00:36:15,774 --> 00:36:18,084
He's here, Francine.

538
00:36:18,109 --> 00:36:21,579
At first I thought
he was walking a dog.

539
00:36:21,613 --> 00:36:24,787
Then I realized it was his date.

540
00:36:24,816 --> 00:36:26,318
I'll be right there!

541
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:43,101
God, Francine, hasn't he
ever heard of the Hilton?

542
00:36:44,302 --> 00:36:47,374
Wait till I get my hands on him.

543
00:36:47,405 --> 00:36:51,114
They went down that way,
but I don't know which room.

544
00:36:51,142 --> 00:36:52,621
I picked up her scent already.

545
00:36:52,644 --> 00:36:54,123
Cheap Midnight in Paris perfume.

546
00:36:54,145 --> 00:36:55,852
I can smell it anywhere!

547
00:36:58,616 --> 00:37:00,118
This is it.
Hold this.

548
00:37:01,486 --> 00:37:04,763
One...two...three...

549
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:07,703
What the hell?!

550
00:37:07,726 --> 00:37:09,034
Coitus interruptus?

551
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,266
Get out of here, Francine!

552
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:15,637
Caught you, didn't I?
Right in the act of adultery!

553
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:20,307
I won't stand for this, Elmer.
I want a divorce!

554
00:37:20,338 --> 00:37:23,319
And a big, fat settlement
to go along with it!

555
00:37:23,341 --> 00:37:24,581
You'll never get a penny
out of me...

556
00:37:24,609 --> 00:37:26,714
you fat hunk of cellulite.

557
00:37:26,745 --> 00:37:28,554
I only support the women I love.

558
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:30,491
See these rings?

559
00:37:30,515 --> 00:37:32,324
Guess who bought them for me.

560
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:34,489
If you want,
you can look at my clothes.

561
00:37:34,519 --> 00:37:37,022
They're the finest
of polyester, and...

562
00:37:37,055 --> 00:37:40,525
I didn't pay for them.

563
00:37:40,558 --> 00:37:41,866
Don't worry, Francine.

564
00:37:41,893 --> 00:37:45,340
I hear every word
that this scag says...

565
00:37:45,363 --> 00:37:48,003
and I'll testify in court.

566
00:37:48,032 --> 00:37:50,308
Come on, Sandra. Get dressed.

567
00:37:50,335 --> 00:37:53,009
Let's go to some
snazzy cocktail lounge...

568
00:37:53,037 --> 00:37:54,914
and celebrate my new freedom.

569
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:58,148
But, Elmer, what about Dexter
and little Lu-Lu?

570
00:37:58,176 --> 00:37:59,621
Those two little bastards...

571
00:37:59,644 --> 00:38:02,784
are a perfect argument
for birth control.

572
00:38:02,814 --> 00:38:08,856
Children would get in the way
of our erotic lifestyle.

573
00:38:08,887 --> 00:38:11,333
You piece of trash!

574
00:38:14,993 --> 00:38:16,734
You'll hear from my attorney!

575
00:38:23,535 --> 00:38:25,606
Oh, Francine, don't worry.

576
00:38:25,637 --> 00:38:27,173
You'll get another man.

577
00:38:27,205 --> 00:38:29,913
Don't worry.
Everything will be all right.

578
00:38:29,941 --> 00:38:31,784
Take it easy on that sauce.

579
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:33,915
Don't drink too much, Francine.

580
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:50,187
Hi, Ms. Fishpaw.
This'll be $14.88.

581
00:40:50,214 --> 00:40:51,818
I didn't order anything.

582
00:40:51,849 --> 00:40:54,420
But this is 538 Wyman Way,
isn't it?

583
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:55,795
I didn't order anything.

584
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:57,197
It's just my husband
harassing me.

585
00:40:57,221 --> 00:41:00,168
Please leave me alone!

586
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:03,766
Wait a minute.

587
00:41:03,795 --> 00:41:06,241
Come on, lady. Open up.
It's getting cold.

588
00:41:06,264 --> 00:41:07,436
Yo, pizza.

589
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:40,642
Leave me alone!

590
00:41:49,674 --> 00:41:52,245
Having a little
wake-up cocktail?

591
00:41:52,276 --> 00:41:55,052
Your father has been
tormenting me all morning!

592
00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:58,060
That's no excuse.
You big drunk!

593
00:42:00,752 --> 00:42:02,231
What do you think you're doing?

594
00:42:02,253 --> 00:42:04,255
I need money for a cab.

595
00:42:04,288 --> 00:42:06,962
Have you forgotten today's
the day for my abortion?

596
00:42:06,991 --> 00:42:09,699
Lu-Lu, there's a living thing
inside of you.

597
00:42:09,727 --> 00:42:11,866
Oh, Lu-Lu, have the baby.

598
00:42:11,896 --> 00:42:13,671
We'll raise it together.

599
00:42:13,698 --> 00:42:16,440
We'll get a little bassinet
and some Pampers.

600
00:42:16,467 --> 00:42:18,777
Oh, Lu-Lu,
that baby is part of you.

601
00:42:18,803 --> 00:42:21,784
It's stealing part of me,
you mean!

602
00:42:21,806 --> 00:42:23,843
I can feel it like cancer...

603
00:42:23,875 --> 00:42:26,412
getting bigger and bigger,
like the Blob.

604
00:42:26,444 --> 00:42:28,788
One day, it'll rip me open!

605
00:42:28,813 --> 00:42:30,724
And it'll be there in my life...

606
00:42:30,748 --> 00:42:35,697
ready to rob me of every bit
of fun I deserve to have!

607
00:42:59,644 --> 00:43:00,884
Look at yourself.

608
00:43:00,912 --> 00:43:02,084
Please!

609
00:43:02,113 --> 00:43:04,787
You better get yourself
to an alcoholics meeting...

610
00:43:04,816 --> 00:43:06,921
before you end up
in the poorhouse!

611
00:43:06,951 --> 00:43:08,157
What's in the bottle, Mother?

612
00:43:08,186 --> 00:43:10,496
Your beloved booze, Francine.

613
00:43:10,521 --> 00:43:12,057
Want a little scent?

614
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:13,535
Please,
don't do it to me, Mother.

615
00:43:13,558 --> 00:43:15,663
Want some?

616
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:20,640
You see what an alcoholic
you are?

617
00:43:20,665 --> 00:43:24,340
You'd even drink gasoline
if it was in a bottle.

618
00:43:24,368 --> 00:43:27,212
You stink like an alcoholic!

619
00:43:27,238 --> 00:43:30,708
Positively disgusting!

620
00:43:33,678 --> 00:43:39,026
Francine Fishpaw
lives at 538 Wyman Way.

621
00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:42,088
She weighs 300 pounds...

622
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:44,191
and is an alcoholic.

623
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:51,338
She eats an entire cake
at one sitting.

624
00:43:51,362 --> 00:43:54,275
You should see
her stretch marks.

625
00:43:55,533 --> 00:43:57,410
Because of her drunkenness...

626
00:43:57,435 --> 00:44:00,109
both her children
are delinquents.

627
00:44:03,841 --> 00:44:06,082
She's the hairiest woman...

628
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:09,489
I've ever laid eyes on.

629
00:44:32,770 --> 00:44:35,148
What's the matter, ma petite?

630
00:44:35,173 --> 00:44:36,811
Speak English, Cuddles.

631
00:44:36,841 --> 00:44:39,014
Please, speak English.

632
00:44:39,043 --> 00:44:41,649
You want a little drinky,
Franciney?

633
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:44,319
Oh, God.
Help me up. Please.

634
00:44:47,151 --> 00:44:49,563
You're so cute
when you get tipsy.

635
00:44:49,587 --> 00:44:52,568
Oh, Cuddles,
lam an alcoholic.

636
00:44:52,590 --> 00:44:54,797
You should get out more, then,
honey...

637
00:44:54,825 --> 00:44:57,738
and forget
your silly nilly problems.

638
00:44:57,762 --> 00:44:59,833
You got to get me
to the alcoholics meeting.

639
00:44:59,864 --> 00:45:03,107
I'll take you to your
club meeting, Francine...

640
00:45:03,134 --> 00:45:05,944
but first,
you're going shopping with me.

641
00:45:05,970 --> 00:45:08,610
I simply cannot stand
another day...

642
00:45:08,639 --> 00:45:11,552
undecided about
my debutante gown.

643
00:45:11,576 --> 00:45:14,489
I've got to get
to the alcoholics meet--

644
00:45:14,512 --> 00:45:18,187
Heintz! Heintz!

645
00:45:18,216 --> 00:45:19,957
Hurry, Heintz! Hurw!

646
00:45:21,252 --> 00:45:24,529
Hurry! Come on!
Come on, Heintz!

647
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:27,058
Oh, Francine.
Hurry!

648
00:45:27,091 --> 00:45:28,502
At your service, Madame.

649
00:45:28,526 --> 00:45:30,028
Mrs. Fishpaw and I...

650
00:45:30,061 --> 00:45:34,066
have decided to view
the new Paris creations, Heintz.

651
00:45:34,098 --> 00:45:35,668
I would like it
if you would help me...

652
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:38,180
get her into a more
presentable outfit.

653
00:45:38,202 --> 00:45:39,180
Yes, Madame.

654
00:45:39,203 --> 00:45:41,240
Come on, Francine.
We're going shopping.

655
00:45:41,272 --> 00:45:43,047
Mrs. Fishpaw, come on, let's go.

656
00:45:43,074 --> 00:45:44,815
This way, Mrs. Fish paw.
Upstairs.

657
00:45:44,842 --> 00:45:46,685
Let's go upstairs,
Mrs. Fishpaw.

658
00:45:46,711 --> 00:45:47,689
Upstairs?

659
00:45:47,712 --> 00:45:49,350
This way. Yes, ma'am.

660
00:46:07,632 --> 00:46:10,010
Look at this dress, Francine.

661
00:46:10,034 --> 00:46:12,605
Isn't it ra-sha-sha?

662
00:46:12,637 --> 00:46:14,674
It's very pretty, Cuddles.

663
00:46:17,975 --> 00:46:20,717
A Halston!

664
00:46:20,745 --> 00:46:22,986
How au courant!

665
00:46:23,014 --> 00:46:27,463
I'm going to try this one on,
too, and I'll be right back!

666
00:46:27,485 --> 00:46:30,796
This place is glamorous!

667
00:46:30,821 --> 00:46:34,166
Hurry. I don't want
to be late for my meeting.

668
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:41,201
God!

669
00:46:41,232 --> 00:46:43,644
Damn these designers!

670
00:47:15,399 --> 00:47:16,844
Ah, shoes...

671
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:26,215
Madam, you will simply have to
leave this store immediately...

672
00:47:26,243 --> 00:47:28,951
or I will be forced
to call the security guards.

673
00:47:28,979 --> 00:47:31,118
You're really gauche, madam.

674
00:47:31,148 --> 00:47:35,528
A regular little cochon,
and that means pig.

675
00:47:35,553 --> 00:47:36,793
Come on, Francine.

676
00:47:36,821 --> 00:47:41,793
We should have gone straight
to Peck and Peck after all.

677
00:47:53,371 --> 00:47:55,578
Call the police!

678
00:47:57,942 --> 00:48:02,152
Fellow members, we have
someone new with us tonight.

679
00:48:02,179 --> 00:48:05,558
Her name is Francine Fishpaw...

680
00:48:05,583 --> 00:48:07,358
and she's an alcoholic.

681
00:48:07,385 --> 00:48:11,424
Francine, come up here
and witness for us.

682
00:48:11,455 --> 00:48:15,130
- Step up there, now!
- Come on!

683
00:48:15,159 --> 00:48:17,469
Come on! Get up there!

684
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:38,160
I really don't know what to say.

685
00:48:38,182 --> 00:48:40,958
Say it! Say it! Say it!

686
00:48:43,487 --> 00:48:46,024
Well, my name
is Francine Fishpawâ€œ

687
00:48:46,056 --> 00:48:49,833
And? And? And?

688
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:52,101
And lam an alcoholic!

689
00:48:57,668 --> 00:49:00,547
Miss Mallon,
we're all ready for you.

690
00:49:00,571 --> 00:49:02,881
Now, don't be afraid.

691
00:49:02,907 --> 00:49:04,784
This'll be all over
before you know it.

692
00:49:04,809 --> 00:49:08,154
I guess I made
the right decision.

693
00:49:08,179 --> 00:49:10,056
Don't have this abortion!

694
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:12,185
How does it feel
to be a murderer?

695
00:49:12,216 --> 00:49:13,661
Killer! Murderer!

696
00:49:13,684 --> 00:49:15,391
Babies wanna live, too,
you know!

697
00:49:15,419 --> 00:49:17,922
Suppose Einstein's mother
had an abortion!

698
00:49:17,955 --> 00:49:19,662
Or John F. Kennedy's, huh?

699
00:49:19,690 --> 00:49:22,000
What if Maw and Joseph
had had an abortion?

700
00:49:22,026 --> 00:49:24,006
Pro life! Pro life! Pro life!

701
00:49:24,028 --> 00:49:26,099
That's from Jesus!

702
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:28,804
That's what he would do,
you murderer!

703
00:49:33,370 --> 00:49:34,713
Thank you, Heintz.

704
00:49:39,410 --> 00:49:41,481
You're going to hurt yourself!

705
00:49:41,512 --> 00:49:43,458
Stop spying on me!

706
00:49:43,481 --> 00:49:45,552
Leave me alone!

707
00:49:50,488 --> 00:49:52,297
Lu-Lu, stop it.

708
00:49:52,323 --> 00:49:55,827
I need the number of the Home
of the Shepherd's Flock.

709
00:49:55,860 --> 00:49:57,396
Lu-Lu, stop it.

710
00:49:57,428 --> 00:49:58,429
Thank you.

711
00:49:59,797 --> 00:50:01,606
Lu-Lu, stop!

712
00:50:01,632 --> 00:50:03,043
Home of the Shepherd's Flock.

713
00:50:03,067 --> 00:50:06,378
Yes, this is Francine Fishpaw
of 538 Wyman Way.

714
00:50:06,403 --> 00:50:08,280
I need an unwed mothers home.

715
00:50:08,305 --> 00:50:10,945
My pregnant daughter is trying
to induce a miscarriage!

716
00:50:10,975 --> 00:50:12,113
We'll be right there!

717
00:50:27,091 --> 00:50:29,071
Hail Maw, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

718
00:50:29,093 --> 00:50:30,333
Blessed art thou among women...

719
00:50:30,361 --> 00:50:31,601
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus...

720
00:50:31,629 --> 00:50:33,336
She's in the living room.

721
00:50:33,364 --> 00:50:35,503
Thank God you're here.

722
00:50:35,533 --> 00:50:38,707
It's all right, Lu-Lu.
It'll be OK.

723
00:50:47,611 --> 00:50:49,090
Get in there.

724
00:50:49,113 --> 00:50:50,387
You can't do this!

725
00:51:00,124 --> 00:51:01,865
MY back!

726
00:51:13,003 --> 00:51:14,209
Girls!

727
00:51:14,238 --> 00:51:15,512
Instead of rosary tonight...

728
00:51:15,539 --> 00:51:17,917
we have a special treat
planned for you.

729
00:51:17,942 --> 00:51:21,116
- We're all going on a hayride.
- A hayride?

730
00:51:23,847 --> 00:51:25,690
Bring proper clothing...

731
00:51:25,716 --> 00:51:28,026
and proceed
to the wagons immediately!

732
00:51:29,153 --> 00:51:30,461
Go!

733
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:11,205
It hurts! it hurts!

734
00:52:11,228 --> 00:52:14,437
Somebody help me!

735
00:52:14,465 --> 00:52:15,876
Stop this faking!

736
00:52:15,899 --> 00:52:19,608
Prostitutes and devils' witches
lose their babies.

737
00:52:19,637 --> 00:52:21,446
Pray with us, girls!

738
00:53:33,544 --> 00:53:36,718
Open up, Mrs. Fishpaw!
We have a search warrant!

739
00:53:39,049 --> 00:53:40,551
Knock it down.

740
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:44,990
Let's go.

741
00:53:47,891 --> 00:53:50,303
Check everywhere.
I know the evidence is around.

742
00:53:50,327 --> 00:53:52,136
There's gotta be
some kind of shoes here.

743
00:53:52,162 --> 00:53:55,041
This whole family is sick, man.

744
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:57,136
Rip it off.
Let's take a look.

745
00:54:02,039 --> 00:54:03,985
Mrs. Fishpaw,
I have a search warrant...

746
00:54:04,007 --> 00:54:06,681
signed by Judge Solomon Wise
to search this entire house.

747
00:54:06,710 --> 00:54:07,848
For what?

748
00:54:07,878 --> 00:54:10,984
Dexter's been arrested for being
the Baltimore Foot Stomper.

749
00:54:11,014 --> 00:54:13,290
Come on, Jack.
Let's search the house.

750
00:54:13,317 --> 00:54:15,160
- Looky here!
- Look at this.

751
00:54:15,185 --> 00:54:16,323
It's sick! Sick!

752
00:54:16,353 --> 00:54:18,230
Can you believe this?
He is the foot stomper!

753
00:54:18,255 --> 00:54:19,700
- We got it.
- I knew it.

754
00:54:19,723 --> 00:54:21,703
- This stuff will hold up.
- Take it downtown.

755
00:54:21,725 --> 00:54:23,102
What is your name, sir?

756
00:54:23,127 --> 00:54:24,629
Are you related
to Dexter Fishpaw?

757
00:54:24,661 --> 00:54:27,141
Are you a member
of the Fishpaw family?

758
00:54:27,164 --> 00:54:28,643
Are you aware
that Dexter's been arrested?

759
00:54:32,402 --> 00:54:34,279
Anybody home?

760
00:54:34,304 --> 00:54:38,719
Oh, God!
Why hast Thou forsaken me?

761
00:54:38,742 --> 00:54:41,188
Come on.
We're going on a picnic.

762
00:54:41,211 --> 00:54:42,815
Come on. Come on!

763
00:54:42,846 --> 00:54:45,122
Come on, Francine.

764
00:54:49,787 --> 00:54:54,031
Oh, Cuddles,
Elmer sent the fire trucks!

765
00:54:54,057 --> 00:54:55,798
Bravo! Bravo!

766
00:54:55,826 --> 00:54:57,635
Good work! All right!

767
00:54:57,661 --> 00:54:59,436
Nice going! Nice going!

768
00:54:59,463 --> 00:55:00,635
Bravo! Bravo!

769
00:55:00,664 --> 00:55:02,109
There she is!

770
00:55:14,745 --> 00:55:16,986
You terrible person!

771
00:55:23,821 --> 00:55:25,323
Gosh, Francine.

772
00:55:25,355 --> 00:55:28,495
Maybe we'll get on TV tonight.

773
00:55:30,294 --> 00:55:32,797
Want some hooch, Francine?

774
00:55:32,830 --> 00:55:34,138
Oh, thank you, Cuddles.

775
00:55:35,566 --> 00:55:37,375
God, Francine.

776
00:55:37,401 --> 00:55:41,144
You're the most drinking-est gal
I've ever seen.

777
00:55:44,007 --> 00:55:47,147
Maybe I should
get out of Baltimore.

778
00:56:13,170 --> 00:56:17,778
God, Francine,
there must be a God.

779
00:56:17,808 --> 00:56:20,584
Everything is so beautiful!

780
00:56:22,713 --> 00:56:25,819
You gotta have some faith,
Francine.

781
00:56:25,849 --> 00:56:28,420
Everything will be all right.

782
00:56:29,686 --> 00:56:31,825
This is nice.

783
00:56:31,855 --> 00:56:36,668
Come on. Help me
with the tablecloth, will you?

784
00:56:42,799 --> 00:56:44,972
Come on. Let's sit down.

785
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:54,220
Look, Francine.
Tab for our diet.

786
00:56:54,244 --> 00:56:55,951
Ain't that great?

787
00:56:55,979 --> 00:57:01,486
Look, cups...
and--Ooh! Sandwiches!

788
00:57:05,422 --> 00:57:10,963
Francine, happiness
is a picnic in the woods.

789
00:57:13,964 --> 00:57:16,604
God, look around you, Francine.

790
00:57:16,633 --> 00:57:18,374
Look at the nature.

791
00:57:18,402 --> 00:57:21,212
Look, Francine, it's beautiful.

792
00:57:25,075 --> 00:57:28,318
Oh, Francine,
I got ants in my pants!

793
00:57:31,782 --> 00:57:33,193
I smell something.

794
00:57:34,952 --> 00:57:36,932
- I smell something.
- A skunk, Francine!

795
00:57:36,954 --> 00:57:38,160
What is it? What?

796
00:57:38,188 --> 00:57:40,668
- A skunk.
- A skunk!

797
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:52,607
Well, isn't that something?

798
00:57:59,509 --> 00:58:02,285
The divorce
has finally come through!

799
00:58:02,312 --> 00:58:05,885
Two thousand a month
and the house!

800
00:58:05,916 --> 00:58:08,897
Time for us to move in
on that pot of gold!

801
00:58:08,919 --> 00:58:11,957
Someone's at the door.
I'll call you when I get home.

802
00:58:18,028 --> 00:58:19,564
Trick or treat!

803
00:58:19,596 --> 00:58:21,803
I'm sorry,
but I don't live here...

804
00:58:21,832 --> 00:58:23,277
and no one else is at home.

805
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:25,541
What, no candy?

806
00:58:25,569 --> 00:58:27,742
I'm sorry,
but lforgot it was Halloween.

807
00:58:27,771 --> 00:58:30,615
You know what no candy means,
don't you?

808
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:32,711
Halloween just slipped my mind
this year.

809
00:58:32,743 --> 00:58:35,656
That means trick!

810
00:58:44,187 --> 00:58:46,394
Stop it! Leave that alone!

811
00:58:56,566 --> 00:58:59,638
Lady, when we say,
"Trick or treat," we mean it!

812
00:58:59,669 --> 00:59:00,943
Kill her.

813
00:59:00,971 --> 00:59:02,848
Next time,
you won't be so selfish...

814
00:59:02,873 --> 00:59:06,252
and ignore little children
on holidays!

815
00:59:06,276 --> 00:59:08,813
Maybe we have an apple
or something.

816
00:59:08,845 --> 00:59:13,260
Too late now, Grandma.
No candy means death!

817
00:59:15,352 --> 00:59:17,332
Let's destroy this place!

818
00:59:25,862 --> 00:59:27,205
See you later!

819
00:59:42,679 --> 00:59:45,455
Oh, God! Bo-Bo!

820
00:59:45,482 --> 00:59:48,861
- Good night, Francine.
- Good night, Cuddles.

821
00:59:48,885 --> 00:59:52,799
Sleep tight.
Don't let the bedbugs bite.

822
00:59:53,824 --> 00:59:56,361
Don't forget
to wash your clothes.

823
00:59:58,695 --> 01:00:00,572
Have a peaceful night,
Mrs. Fishpaw.

824
01:00:00,597 --> 01:00:01,769
Good night, Heintz.

825
01:00:07,704 --> 01:00:10,310
It's all your fault!

826
01:00:19,716 --> 01:00:22,492
No, God, please. Not my baby.

827
01:00:24,221 --> 01:00:26,394
Oh, God, not my little girl.

828
01:00:54,484 --> 01:00:55,656
Hi, Mom!

829
01:00:57,487 --> 01:01:00,366
Dexter! Honey! You're home!

830
01:01:04,761 --> 01:01:07,241
Oh, honey, let me look at you.

831
01:01:07,264 --> 01:01:09,801
I'm sorry
for the grief I caused you...

832
01:01:09,833 --> 01:01:12,780
but I'm rehabilitated now.

833
01:01:12,802 --> 01:01:15,510
I had a wonderful
drug counselor in prison...

834
01:01:15,539 --> 01:01:18,611
and I received
psychiatric treatment.

835
01:01:18,642 --> 01:01:22,749
Mom, I am an artist now.

836
01:01:22,779 --> 01:01:25,885
Oh, honey. it is beautiful.

837
01:01:25,916 --> 01:01:28,226
We'll hang it
right in the living room.

838
01:01:28,251 --> 01:01:30,162
We can put this one
in the kitchen.

839
01:01:31,688 --> 01:01:33,998
I'm saving this one for my room.

840
01:01:34,024 --> 01:01:35,628
Would you like
some milk and cookies, Dexter?

841
01:01:35,659 --> 01:01:37,730
Oh, I'd love some, Mom.

842
01:01:37,761 --> 01:01:38,967
Come on, honey.

843
01:01:38,995 --> 01:01:41,635
I bet that food in prison
was just terrible!

844
01:01:41,665 --> 01:01:43,645
I sure missed
your home cooking, Mom.

845
01:01:43,667 --> 01:01:44,839
Oh, honey.

846
01:01:46,736 --> 01:01:48,579
There's no place like home,
honey.

847
01:01:50,140 --> 01:01:53,144
Everything looks just the same.

848
01:01:53,176 --> 01:01:55,417
It's so good to have you back.

849
01:01:55,445 --> 01:01:57,083
Mom, are you still drinking?

850
01:01:57,113 --> 01:02:02,756
Dexter, I'm afraid
your ma's an alcoholic.

851
01:02:02,786 --> 01:02:06,029
Oh, Mom, you could stop.
I got off the angel dust.

852
01:02:07,657 --> 01:02:09,637
I wanna stop.

853
01:02:09,659 --> 01:02:12,367
Just pour it
down the drain, Mom.

854
01:02:12,395 --> 01:02:13,999
I want to.

855
01:02:14,030 --> 01:02:17,477
I want us to be happy again,
like we used to be...

856
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:20,538
before your father abandoned us.

857
01:02:20,570 --> 01:02:24,746
I love you, Mom!
Go ahead. You can stop.

858
01:02:24,774 --> 01:02:28,017
- Oh, Dexter.
- You don't need it anymore.

859
01:02:28,044 --> 01:02:29,819
You'll be much happier.

860
01:02:32,115 --> 01:02:35,028
Oh, honey, today
is going to be a new beginning.

861
01:02:35,051 --> 01:02:37,497
We're going to be
a real family again.

862
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:39,591
- Oh, Mom.
- Oh, Dexter.

863
01:02:40,590 --> 01:02:42,365
Welcome home, Dexter.

864
01:02:42,392 --> 01:02:46,033
Hello, Lu-Lu. Will you
give your brother a kiss?

865
01:02:49,866 --> 01:02:53,712
Forgive me for being so awful,
but I've changed.

866
01:02:53,737 --> 01:02:57,879
Bo-Bo's dead,
and I've had a miscarriage.

867
01:02:57,907 --> 01:03:01,286
- That's awful.
- But I've discovered macrame!

868
01:03:01,311 --> 01:03:03,313
It's helped me find myself.

869
01:03:03,346 --> 01:03:06,418
I'm gentler now
and more creative.

870
01:03:06,449 --> 01:03:08,622
I'm an artist now, too, Lu-Lu.

871
01:03:08,652 --> 01:03:12,725
I'm off drugs and ready for
a new beginning here at home.

872
01:03:12,756 --> 01:03:14,929
Oh, you see, children?

873
01:03:14,958 --> 01:03:17,438
It's not hard to be normal.

874
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:19,462
Oh, thank you, God.

875
01:03:19,496 --> 01:03:21,976
Thank you
for answering my prayers!

876
01:03:21,998 --> 01:03:24,205
We're a real family again.

877
01:03:24,234 --> 01:03:27,647
A normal American family.

878
01:03:32,876 --> 01:03:36,255
Hello, Mother.
Feeling any better today?

879
01:03:36,279 --> 01:03:40,591
How can I feel better with
a drunken miser as a daughter?

880
01:03:40,617 --> 01:03:42,153
Shut up, Mother!

881
01:03:42,185 --> 01:03:46,258
For forty-four years, I've tried
to be a good daughter to you...

882
01:03:46,289 --> 01:03:48,860
and all I've gotten in return
is abuse.

883
01:03:48,892 --> 01:03:50,667
I've given you money--

884
01:03:50,694 --> 01:03:52,935
thousands and thousands
of dollars--

885
01:03:52,962 --> 01:03:54,635
and still it's not enough!

886
01:03:54,664 --> 01:03:56,166
Well, I've had it.

887
01:03:56,199 --> 01:03:59,544
You can rot in that wheelchair
for all I care!

888
01:03:59,569 --> 01:04:01,742
The pain,the pain! My heart!
She's giving me a heart attack!

889
01:04:01,771 --> 01:04:03,546
Oh, God, help! Help!

890
01:04:21,324 --> 01:04:22,496
Pull over here.

891
01:04:27,697 --> 01:04:29,438
Stop the cab.

892
01:04:29,466 --> 01:04:31,139
- Here?
-Yes, yes. Right here.

893
01:04:31,167 --> 01:04:32,737
I'll stay here.

894
01:04:36,773 --> 01:04:38,684
Here. Keep the change.

895
01:04:51,888 --> 01:04:53,299
Hey, come here.

896
01:05:02,832 --> 01:05:04,175
Really horrible, isn't it?

897
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:06,271
Oh, those poor people.

898
01:05:06,302 --> 01:05:08,179
Did you see it happen?

899
01:05:08,204 --> 01:05:09,979
Yes, I saw it happen.

900
01:05:10,006 --> 01:05:11,986
I was following that van...

901
01:05:12,008 --> 01:05:13,316
and that other thing
cut right in front.

902
01:05:13,343 --> 01:05:15,550
- Wham! Hit it head on.
- Excuse me.

903
01:05:15,578 --> 01:05:16,648
It was really horrible.

904
01:05:16,679 --> 01:05:19,683
It is. it's just too horrible.
I can't look.

905
01:05:19,716 --> 01:05:21,923
Hey, you know...

906
01:05:21,951 --> 01:05:23,897
why don't we take a ride
in the country...

907
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:25,957
and get away from all this mess?

908
01:05:25,989 --> 01:05:30,165
I mean, it's a beautiful day,
and I find you quite attractive.

909
01:05:30,193 --> 01:05:33,231
But I don't even know your name.

910
01:05:33,263 --> 01:05:35,971
- It's Todd, honey.
-Todd?

911
01:05:35,999 --> 01:05:37,842
Todd Tomorrow.

912
01:05:37,867 --> 01:05:40,108
Hi. I'm Francine Fishpaw.

913
01:05:42,772 --> 01:05:45,685
It's a beautiful name.
Fits you well.

914
01:05:47,177 --> 01:05:49,282
I got something
I want to show you.

915
01:05:50,447 --> 01:05:52,484
It's long...

916
01:05:52,515 --> 01:05:54,552
and it's sleek...

917
01:05:54,584 --> 01:05:56,154
and it's powerful.

918
01:05:56,186 --> 01:05:58,063
Ooh, what is it, Todd?

919
01:05:58,087 --> 01:05:59,657
It's my new 'vette!

920
01:06:12,101 --> 01:06:13,409
Hop in, honey.

921
01:06:20,276 --> 01:06:21,448
We're off!

922
01:07:22,472 --> 01:07:24,145
If I break a nail...

923
01:07:24,173 --> 01:07:26,175
you're really never gonna
hear the end of this one!

924
01:07:26,209 --> 01:07:28,382
I'm gettin' sick and tired
of all your complaining.

925
01:07:28,411 --> 01:07:30,755
All you do
is complain, complain, complain.

926
01:07:30,780 --> 01:07:33,090
You'd complain, too, if you had
a boyfriend who was like you.

927
01:07:33,116 --> 01:07:34,356
Why don't you get a decent car?

928
01:07:34,384 --> 01:07:36,364
- Get the thing closer--
- I'm working on it!

929
01:07:36,386 --> 01:07:38,559
- You expect me to do it all?
- Get back to work, Elmer!

930
01:07:49,232 --> 01:07:51,234
Get going. Get going. Hurry up!

931
01:07:51,267 --> 01:07:52,712
Why don't you go back
to Francine?

932
01:07:52,735 --> 01:07:53,873
We ought to go catch 'em.

933
01:07:53,903 --> 01:07:56,110
He's got some good taste
in cars, anyway.

934
01:08:01,144 --> 01:08:03,351
My, what a nice place.

935
01:08:03,379 --> 01:08:05,120
Oh, it's such a mess.

936
01:08:05,148 --> 01:08:07,719
I'm so embarrassed
for you to see it like this.

937
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:09,127
Would you like to meet
the children?

938
01:08:09,152 --> 01:08:13,328
- I can hardly wait.
- Oh, OK. Follow me.

939
01:08:13,356 --> 01:08:14,630
Stunning.

940
01:08:21,631 --> 01:08:22,837
Hi, Mom.

941
01:08:22,865 --> 01:08:25,539
Lu-Lu, I'd like you to meet
a friend of mine--

942
01:08:25,568 --> 01:08:26,842
Mr. Todd Tomorrow.

943
01:08:26,869 --> 01:08:28,906
Todd, this is my daughter Lu-Lu.

944
01:08:28,938 --> 01:08:30,281
Nice to meet you.

945
01:08:31,107 --> 01:08:34,145
- Hi, darlin'.
- Let's go meet my little Dexter.

946
01:08:35,979 --> 01:08:39,153
Well...l don't know.

947
01:08:40,149 --> 01:08:41,822
Oh, come in. Hi, Mother.

948
01:08:41,851 --> 01:08:44,263
Hi, honey.
This is my little Dexter.

949
01:08:44,287 --> 01:08:45,766
He's a creative artist.

950
01:08:45,788 --> 01:08:48,394
Dexter, this is my friend
Mr. Todd Tomorrow.

951
01:08:48,424 --> 01:08:50,961
- Put it there, young feller.
- How you doing?

952
01:08:52,328 --> 01:08:54,808
Hey, I seen you before.

953
01:08:54,831 --> 01:08:57,835
I seen you before on IV.
I seen him on the news.

954
01:08:57,867 --> 01:09:00,245
Dexter was just released
from prison.

955
01:09:00,269 --> 01:09:02,579
Oh, well, that's nice.
Congratulations!

956
01:09:02,605 --> 01:09:05,279
- Oh, thank you.
- And that's nice, too.

957
01:09:05,308 --> 01:09:07,515
That's a real masterpiece.

958
01:09:07,543 --> 01:09:09,045
- Yeah. Do you like it?
- You bet.

959
01:09:09,078 --> 01:09:10,751
You keep up that good work,
you hear?

960
01:09:10,780 --> 01:09:11,952
I will, Todd.

961
01:09:14,017 --> 01:09:16,293
Why don't you show me
your bedroom, honey?

962
01:09:16,319 --> 01:09:18,663
- Mother, may I?
- Yes, you may.

963
01:09:22,892 --> 01:09:25,463
Oh, Todd, I've had a bad year.

964
01:09:25,495 --> 01:09:27,702
Please don't be too harsh
in your judgments.

965
01:09:27,730 --> 01:09:29,266
Well, it's exquisite.

966
01:09:31,034 --> 01:09:33,014
Look at me.

967
01:09:33,036 --> 01:09:34,743
Read my lips.

968
01:09:34,771 --> 01:09:38,082
I love you.

969
01:09:38,107 --> 01:09:39,814
I'm sorry I'm so nervous.

970
01:09:39,842 --> 01:09:42,755
It's just that my husband's
been harassing me every day.

971
01:09:42,779 --> 01:09:46,124
I can't help it. I'm afraid
he's going to kill me!

972
01:09:46,149 --> 01:09:48,254
I crave liquor
right this minute.

973
01:09:48,284 --> 01:09:50,958
Easy does it, baby.

974
01:09:50,987 --> 01:09:53,126
One day at a time.

975
01:09:53,156 --> 01:09:56,330
I ache. I ache all over.

976
01:09:56,359 --> 01:09:59,101
Let me kiss away your D.T.s,
honey.

977
01:10:09,005 --> 01:10:10,746
I love you, Francine.

978
01:10:12,175 --> 01:10:15,816
I love your little ankles
and your little wrists.

979
01:10:15,845 --> 01:10:18,849
Your little breasts,
your little belly.

980
01:10:18,881 --> 01:10:21,919
Oh, Todd. Dare I say it?

981
01:10:21,951 --> 01:10:25,296
I love you, too, my darling.

982
01:10:25,321 --> 01:10:28,461
Then let's make love,
you sweet little thing.

983
01:10:33,730 --> 01:10:36,711
Oh, Todd, be gentle with me.

984
01:10:36,733 --> 01:10:39,373
Please, be gentle.

985
01:11:18,374 --> 01:11:20,547
Time to wake up, honey.

986
01:11:20,576 --> 01:11:23,284
Did you sleep all right,
my darling?

987
01:11:23,312 --> 01:11:25,383
It was bliss.

988
01:11:26,415 --> 01:11:28,190
Are you my little fleshpot?

989
01:11:33,256 --> 01:11:34,530
Will you marry me?

990
01:11:37,160 --> 01:11:39,162
You don't mean that.

991
01:11:39,195 --> 01:11:42,699
Yes, I do.
I want you to be my wife.

992
01:11:42,732 --> 01:11:45,645
Oh, Todd.
Of course I'll marry you...

993
01:11:45,668 --> 01:11:48,740
but can you afford to take us on
as a family?

994
01:11:48,771 --> 01:11:52,583
Hell, yes, I can. I own
the Edmondson Drive-in Cinema.

995
01:11:52,608 --> 01:11:53,951
You do?

996
01:12:06,289 --> 01:12:08,030
Visit our concession stand.

997
01:12:08,057 --> 01:12:09,195
We feature beluga caviar...

998
01:12:09,225 --> 01:12:11,569
succulent oysters,
and champagne.

999
01:12:11,594 --> 01:12:13,232
Take a tempting taste treat...

1000
01:12:13,262 --> 01:12:16,175
and ponder the intellectual
meaning of cinema.

1001
01:12:43,092 --> 01:12:45,368
Well, what do you think,
sweetheart?

1002
01:12:45,394 --> 01:12:48,568
Oh, it's very highbrow, Todd.

1003
01:12:48,598 --> 01:12:52,068
Yep. We only show
first-run art films here.

1004
01:12:52,101 --> 01:12:54,445
You wait here a sec
while I check them receipts.

1005
01:12:54,470 --> 01:12:57,212
OK, but hurry. I don't want
to be late for Cuddles' party.

1006
01:13:03,446 --> 01:13:05,892
- Hey, what's happenin', Todd?
- Hi, darling.

1007
01:13:05,915 --> 01:13:07,326
- Right there.
- How you doin', my man?

1008
01:13:07,350 --> 01:13:10,126
- Not bad.
- Here you go.

1009
01:13:10,152 --> 01:13:13,190
- Nose candy.
- Yeah, sweets for the sweet.

1010
01:13:13,222 --> 01:13:14,701
Dynamite!

1011
01:13:23,900 --> 01:13:26,813
- Free basing!
- Let's do it, Todd, baby.

1012
01:13:26,836 --> 01:13:30,010
- Go get her, honey!
- Right after I blast off.

1013
01:13:35,544 --> 01:13:37,148
I got a date with an angel.

1014
01:14:46,649 --> 01:14:48,287
Thank you, thank you.

1015
01:14:48,317 --> 01:14:52,561
And now the moment
we've all been waiting for--

1016
01:14:52,588 --> 01:14:55,398
that lovely lady herself...

1017
01:14:55,424 --> 01:14:57,461
Miss Cuddles.

1018
01:15:44,206 --> 01:15:46,186
I have something for you,
my dear.

1019
01:15:46,208 --> 01:15:48,085
What is it, Heintz?

1020
01:15:49,545 --> 01:15:52,583
Oh, Heintz, it's beautiful.

1021
01:15:52,615 --> 01:15:55,255
Cuddles, will you marry me?
Please?

1022
01:15:57,820 --> 01:15:59,891
I'll marry you, Heintz.

1023
01:16:05,361 --> 01:16:06,931
Thank you, Cuddles.

1024
01:16:27,083 --> 01:16:29,393
I could've danced all night.

1025
01:18:14,757 --> 01:18:16,031
Oh, God!

1026
01:18:19,795 --> 01:18:22,139
Let's keep love in the family,
honey.

1027
01:18:22,164 --> 01:18:25,737
No! Not my mother!

1028
01:18:26,835 --> 01:18:28,712
Let go of me!

1029
01:18:28,737 --> 01:18:31,183
You monster! You monster!

1030
01:18:33,776 --> 01:18:35,813
You've been a good old wagon,
Francine...

1031
01:18:35,844 --> 01:18:38,654
but you done broke down.

1032
01:18:38,681 --> 01:18:42,026
Here's a present for you,
daughter dear.

1033
01:18:42,051 --> 01:18:44,190
Something for your nose.

1034
01:18:44,220 --> 01:18:48,259
This will make you feel
all better.

1035
01:18:54,463 --> 01:18:56,443
What's going on?

1036
01:18:57,900 --> 01:18:59,072
What's that?

1037
01:19:12,314 --> 01:19:13,452
Leave me alone!

1038
01:19:13,482 --> 01:19:16,486
Killer!

1039
01:19:16,518 --> 01:19:18,828
He's dead!

1040
01:19:18,854 --> 01:19:20,731
What the hell is goin' on here?

1041
01:19:20,756 --> 01:19:23,828
I never wanted to use macrame
to kill.

1042
01:19:23,859 --> 01:19:27,363
Why, it's Elmer!
Her lousy cheap husband.

1043
01:19:27,396 --> 01:19:29,569
He was twin' to kill Francine.

1044
01:19:31,100 --> 01:19:33,774
Nonsense, La Rue.
What the hell you talkin' about?

1045
01:19:33,802 --> 01:19:37,340
Francine done it.
She's the one who killed him.

1046
01:19:37,373 --> 01:19:39,478
What are you doing to Mother?

1047
01:19:39,508 --> 01:19:40,680
Shut up, you little slut.

1048
01:19:40,709 --> 01:19:43,747
She's gone insane,
and we're putting her...

1049
01:19:43,779 --> 01:19:46,282
in a mental hospital
where she belongs.

1050
01:19:48,183 --> 01:19:50,094
I'm gonna
take care of them little creeps.

1051
01:19:54,490 --> 01:19:56,868
Hey, Flashlight!
Get on over here!

1052
01:19:56,892 --> 01:19:58,371
OK, Todd baby!

1053
01:20:02,498 --> 01:20:04,535
Hey, man, the chickens ready?

1054
01:20:06,902 --> 01:20:08,040
Take that little whore...

1055
01:20:08,070 --> 01:20:10,710
down to the massage parlor
where she belongs.

1056
01:20:10,739 --> 01:20:12,980
And as for you, bunghole...

1057
01:20:13,008 --> 01:20:15,284
you got an appointment
at the House of Torture...

1058
01:20:15,311 --> 01:20:17,382
with some very dirty old men.

1059
01:20:17,413 --> 01:20:19,552
All right, chickens, move it!

1060
01:20:22,084 --> 01:20:23,256
You!

1061
01:20:24,553 --> 01:20:26,555
Does this mean
the Wedding's over, honey?

1062
01:20:27,890 --> 01:20:29,927
I do think she's havin'
a little nervous breakdown.

1063
01:20:31,026 --> 01:20:33,097
I better call
the mental hospital.

1064
01:20:34,296 --> 01:20:36,469
- Shut up.
- Right.

1065
01:20:36,498 --> 01:20:37,704
Stop that!

1066
01:20:40,536 --> 01:20:44,848
Happy Hills?
This is 538 Wyman Way.

1067
01:20:44,873 --> 01:20:47,046
Yeah, you'd better send some
attendants over here right away.

1068
01:20:47,076 --> 01:20:49,784
We got this thing,
this big thing...

1069
01:20:49,812 --> 01:20:51,985
this woman's had a breakdown.

1070
01:20:52,014 --> 01:20:53,823
Yeah, she's committed
a double homicide...

1071
01:20:53,849 --> 01:20:55,522
on her husband
and his girlfriend.

1072
01:20:57,386 --> 01:20:59,423
Yeah, right! Thank you.

1073
01:21:02,725 --> 01:21:05,899
Thank God I'm rid of her.
She'll be locked up for life.

1074
01:21:05,928 --> 01:21:09,501
I'll drain her bank account
and sell the house.

1075
01:21:09,531 --> 01:21:11,977
And I can get $5,000 for each
one of them little creeps...

1076
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,571
and if I sell that drive-in,
we'll be rich.

1077
01:21:14,603 --> 01:21:15,911
Let's move to Miami.

1078
01:21:15,938 --> 01:21:17,975
Finally, I can get my face-lift.

1079
01:21:18,006 --> 01:21:21,453
I want a Cadillac, too--
a big purple Cadillac--

1080
01:21:21,477 --> 01:21:25,323
so I can ride around
and laugh at poor people.

1081
01:21:25,347 --> 01:21:27,759
I'm gonna get me one of them
solid gold leisure suits...

1082
01:21:27,783 --> 01:21:29,785
and I can just strut around
at Fontaine Bleu.

1083
01:21:29,818 --> 01:21:32,389
Whoo-hoo! We're gonna be happy
in Miami, La Rue.

1084
01:21:32,421 --> 01:21:35,664
- Happy!
-Rich and happy, Todd!

1085
01:21:35,691 --> 01:21:39,935
Free, white, rich, and happy!

1086
01:21:39,962 --> 01:21:41,305
Hot damn!

1087
01:21:42,831 --> 01:21:45,004
Help me! Help me!

1088
01:21:45,033 --> 01:21:46,171
Come on, come on!

1089
01:21:46,201 --> 01:21:48,807
Help! Oh, God, please!

1090
01:21:48,837 --> 01:21:50,510
- Somebody help me!
- Francine, shut up!

1091
01:21:50,539 --> 01:21:52,849
I feel so wonderful.

1092
01:21:53,776 --> 01:21:55,722
Heintz, look out!

1093
01:21:58,781 --> 01:22:00,158
Ach, du lieber!

1094
01:22:10,659 --> 01:22:12,570
Holy Jesus!

1095
01:22:13,729 --> 01:22:15,504
See you chickens later.

1096
01:22:21,003 --> 01:22:23,711
Oh, my baby!

1097
01:22:23,739 --> 01:22:24,877
It's all right.

1098
01:22:24,907 --> 01:22:26,580
They were gonna kill us!

1099
01:22:29,278 --> 01:22:32,157
It'll all be all right,
Francine.

1100
01:22:32,181 --> 01:22:34,559
It's going to be all right.

1101
01:22:34,583 --> 01:22:35,857
I was nervous.

1102
01:22:35,884 --> 01:22:37,864
Everything will be all right.

1103
01:22:37,886 --> 01:22:40,196
Nothing's right,
nothing's right.

1104
01:22:40,222 --> 01:22:41,929
It's going to be all right.

1105
01:22:41,957 --> 01:22:43,459
No, it's not.

1106
01:22:47,729 --> 01:22:49,572
Oh, smell.

1107
01:22:49,598 --> 01:22:53,171
Oh, everything
smells so much better now.

1108
