00:09:48,388 --> 00:09:50,789
           I was on my way down
           to the corner
           to get cigarettes.

142
00:09:50,824 --> 00:09:52,991
        The corner? Oh, my god!

143
00:09:53,026 --> 00:09:54,292
 What's the matter?

144
00:09:54,328 --> 00:09:56,528
     I wrote Julian telling him
     what I was going to do.

145
00:09:56,563 --> 00:09:58,163
 Why?

146
00:09:58,198 --> 00:10:00,932
    What would be the sense
    of killing myself
    if he didn't know about it?

147
00:10:01,468 --> 00:10:02,701
 Where are you going?

148
00:10:02,736 --> 00:10:04,436
              I've got to get
              that letter back.

149
00:10:04,471 --> 00:10:05,870
 Wait a minute!

150
00:10:05,906 --> 00:10:08,273
             Hey, how do you
             plan to do that?

151
00:10:08,308 --> 00:10:10,141
 With a piece of string
 and some chewing gum.

152
00:10:10,177 --> 00:10:13,011
    Look, you already
    broke the law
    when you attempted suicide.

153
00:10:13,046 --> 00:10:16,147
   Don't start monkeying around
   with the Federal Government.

154
00:10:17,517 --> 00:10:19,117
  I guess you're right.

155
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,753
 What time is it?

156
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:23,154
              It's almost 3:00.

157
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:26,091
 3:00. I've got to get up
 and go to work in the morning.

158
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:28,093
 Go away. I have to sleep.

159
00:10:29,229 --> 00:10:31,663
   Oh, hell with that.
   I'll take the day off.

160
00:10:31,698 --> 00:10:33,565
       Yeah, why kill yourself?

161
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,666
        (LAUGHS)

162
00:10:34,701 --> 00:10:37,335
 Boy, you must be
 a pretty corny writer.

163
00:10:37,371 --> 00:10:39,237
 What sort of things
 do you write?

164
00:10:39,272 --> 00:10:40,405
                         Plays.

165
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,673
  What kind of plays?

166
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:44,776
         Very advanced.
         All the actors
         keep their clothes on.

167
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:46,811
            Public's not quite
            ready for that yet.

168
00:10:46,847 --> 00:10:48,213
  How do you live?

169
00:10:48,248 --> 00:10:50,248
             I get an allowance
             from my father.

170
00:10:50,283 --> 00:10:51,383
           Oh, boy!

171
00:10:51,418 --> 00:10:53,685
     (LAUGHING)
     I was beginning
     to feel sorry for you.

172
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,354
                 Everybody
                 can't be poor.

173
00:10:56,390 --> 00:11:00,125
      Look, (STAMMERING)
      if you need anything,
      just pound on the wall.

174
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,559
       I'll come right away.

175
00:11:02,229 --> 00:11:03,595
   Thanks, Igor.

176
00:11:04,598 --> 00:11:06,031
                    Good night.

177
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:31,556
       (BANGING ON WALL)

178
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:37,228
                     Toni?
                      Igor.

179
00:11:37,264 --> 00:11:39,798
   Igor, I want you to call
   Julian for me in the morning

180
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:41,332
    before he gets that letter.

181
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:43,401
 Why don't you
 call him yourself?

182
00:11:43,437 --> 00:11:45,603
           In the first place,
           I'll be sleeping.

183
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:48,073
       And second place,
       I don't want to give him

184
00:11:48,108 --> 00:11:50,308
             the satisfaction
             of hearing me cry.

185
00:11:50,343 --> 00:11:52,410
              Why not throw
              a scare into him?
              He deserves it.

186
00:11:52,446 --> 00:11:55,613
 Oh, he's liable to call
 the cops or something.
 Will you do it?

187
00:11:55,649 --> 00:11:56,915
               Yeah, all right.

188
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:59,984
 He's in the book.
 Julian Winston, D.D.S.,

00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:02,353
          Julian Winston,

190
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:04,956
          What'll I say to him?

191
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:07,058
 Just tell him I'm alive.
                  You're alive.

192
00:12:07,094 --> 00:12:09,761
       And I never want to
       see him again
       as long as I live!

            Who?

197
00:12:26,513 --> 00:12:29,814
  Igor Sullivan?
  Is it about an appointment?

198
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:33,418
  Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Sullivan,
  but the doctor's
  with a patient right now.

199
00:12:33,453 --> 00:12:36,054
      If you'll just
      give me the message.

200
00:12:37,023 --> 00:12:38,790
      Well, if you insist
      on speaking to him,

201
00:12:38,825 --> 00:12:41,926
       then you'll have to
       call back later.

202
00:12:41,962 --> 00:12:46,364
  A caramel. One lousy caramel,
  and the whole damned
  filling came out.

203
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,933
 Mrs. Durant, it was only
 a temporary filling,

204
00:12:48,969 --> 00:12:50,869
 and you were warned
 to be careful.

205

      (TSKS) Caramels!

            Well, good heavens,
            I've given up
            everything else.

207

                  Is the doctor
                  ready for me?

208
00:12:55,609 --> 00:12:57,442
 He was 20 minutes ago.
 But since you were late,

209
00:12:57,477 --> 00:12:59,377
 he gave your time
 to another patient.

      Morning, Miss Dickinson.

212
00:13:01,915 --> 00:13:03,414
 Oh, thank you, Howard.

213
00:13:04,785 --> 00:13:07,418
     Would you please tell
     the doctor I'm in a hurry?

214
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:09,854
        Charles is expecting me
        in half an hour.

215
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:11,022
               Charles?

               the hairdresser.

217

         care of me personally.

00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:15,693
      I can't keep him waiting.

219

       Really, Mrs. Durant,

220
00:13:18,031 --> 00:13:20,098
  your teeth are more important
  than your hair.

221

       don't you?

             Excuse me, Doctor,
             Mrs. Andrews
             is on the phone.

231

      Her bridge is wobbling.

 at 8:00 tomorrow morning.

       Yes, Doctor.
       And Mrs. Durant is here.

234
00:13:54,734 --> 00:13:57,235
     When you get a minute,
     I'd like to speak to you.
   All right.

235
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:59,737
          Mr. Greenfield,
          please don't handle
          the instruments.

236
00:13:59,773 --> 00:14:02,740
   Say, I was reading the other
   day that there's a dentist
   in New Jersey

237
00:14:02,776 --> 00:14:04,075
        who has topless nurses.

238
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:06,177
         I didn't know
         you were interested
         in reading.

239
00:14:08,882 --> 00:14:11,015
       She really turns me off.

240
00:14:11,051 --> 00:14:12,550
              I thought
              all Swedish dames
              were sexy.

241
00:14:12,586 --> 00:14:14,319
          I mean, I've seen
          some of those movies,

242
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:15,954
               but this one's
               like an iceberg.

243
00:14:15,989 --> 00:14:17,555
 She's very efficient.

244
00:14:17,591 --> 00:14:20,058
         Have you ever seen her
         out of her uniform?

245
00:14:20,093 --> 00:14:21,826
             I mean,
             in street clothes?

246
00:14:21,862 --> 00:14:24,562
             I'll bet she wears
             corrective hats.

247
00:14:24,598 --> 00:14:27,131
 Harvey, what you don't like
 about Miss Dickinson

248
00:14:27,167 --> 00:14:29,567
 is exactly what I do like
 about her.

249
00:14:29,603 --> 00:14:33,204
 She's like a wife,
 a good wife,
 devoted, competent

250
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:36,341
 takes care of everything
 for me during the day.

251
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:38,509
 And at night,
 she goes home, to her home.

252
00:14:38,545 --> 00:14:42,380
 And I, with no problems
 and no cares,
 go to my girl.

253
00:14:42,415 --> 00:14:44,816
 My life is arranged
 the way I like it.

254
00:14:44,851 --> 00:14:46,150
                   Your girl?

255
00:14:46,186 --> 00:14:47,752
            One girl? Singular?

256
00:14:47,787 --> 00:14:49,954
 Didn't I tell you?
 It's been a year now.

257
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:53,291
        Huh. That's not
        the old Julian Winston
        I knew in the old days.

258
00:14:53,326 --> 00:14:56,828
        The dancing dentist
        at the Copa every night
        with a new girl.

259
00:14:56,863 --> 00:15:00,331
   Toni has changed all that.
   I don't want anyone else.

260
00:15:00,367 --> 00:15:02,300
        You mean you're in love
        with her?

261
00:15:02,335 --> 00:15:04,535
      I tried to fight it.
      Take last night.

262
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:06,337
      I deliberately broke
      a date with Toni

263
00:15:06,373 --> 00:15:07,939
         to go out
         with another girl.

264
00:15:07,974 --> 00:15:10,375
 Airline stewardess,
 tall, built,

265
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:13,278
 spectacular-looking
 Australian girl.

266
00:15:13,313 --> 00:15:14,913
 We went up to her place...
                   Yeah.

267
00:15:14,948 --> 00:15:16,314
 ...had a few drinks.
                 Yeah.

268
00:15:16,349 --> 00:15:17,482
         Open.

269
00:15:18,018 --> 00:15:20,218
 Bite. Stay that way.

270
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:23,087
        Hey, you can't leave me
        hanging like this.

271
00:15:23,123 --> 00:15:24,822
 You wanted to see me
 about something?

272
00:15:24,858 --> 00:15:26,524
             Yes, Doctor.

273
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:29,560
   I've been meaning
   to speak to you
   about Mr. Greenfield's bill.

274
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:32,397
 Miss Dickinson, you know
 he's an old friend of mine.

275
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:34,098
      Well, I think he's taking
      advantage of you.

276
00:15:34,134 --> 00:15:36,534
 Miss Dickinson,
 there are some things
 a man just can't do.

277
00:15:36,569 --> 00:15:38,403
 I won't push
 Harvey Greenfield
 for money.

278
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:40,071
 I've known him too long.

279
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:41,139
    You do it.

280
00:15:41,174 --> 00:15:43,141
        Well, I'll be happy to.

281
00:15:43,176 --> 00:15:44,342
      What's this?

282
00:15:44,377 --> 00:15:45,677
               I ordered you
               some new shirts.

283
00:15:45,712 --> 00:15:47,712
        The ones you're wearing
        are frayed
        around the collar.

284
00:15:47,747 --> 00:15:50,281
       You really should change
       laundries. They're using
       too much starch.

285
00:15:50,317 --> 00:15:51,482
 Please stop mothering me.

286
00:15:51,518 --> 00:15:53,051
               Here's a letter
               for you, Doctor.

287
00:15:53,086 --> 00:15:54,852
 When I'm through
 with Mr. Greenfield.

288
00:16:04,831 --> 00:16:06,431
         Rinse, please.

289
00:16:14,007 --> 00:16:15,506
 So, you went up
 to her place.

290
00:16:15,542 --> 00:16:16,607
         Hmm?

291
00:16:16,643 --> 00:16:18,643
      You went up to her place,
      you had a few drinks...

292
00:16:18,678 --> 00:16:22,747
 Oh, oh, yes.
 The stewardess.
 Yes, beautiful girl.

293
00:16:22,782 --> 00:16:23,881
      Beautiful.

294
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:27,485
      Well, then what happened?

295
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,854
 Oh, nothing.
 Toni stopped me.

296
00:16:29,889 --> 00:16:31,155
           Toni? She showed up?

297
00:16:31,191 --> 00:16:32,290
   In my mind.

298
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:33,858
 Suddenly I saw
 her face before me

299
00:16:33,893 --> 00:16:36,427
 and I couldn't
 go through with it.
 I left, walked out.

300
00:16:36,463 --> 00:16:38,830
            You wasted
            a whole stewardess?

301
00:16:39,065 --> 00:16:40,398
        Open.

302
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:45,303
      You going to get married?

303
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:47,338
 Married? Who said anything
 about getting married?

304
00:16:47,374 --> 00:16:48,973
           If you feel that way
           about your girl...

305
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:51,609
 I feel that way about my girl
 because she is my girl.

306
00:16:51,644 --> 00:16:54,112
  You'd never catch me
  feeling that way
  about a wife.

307
00:16:54,147 --> 00:16:56,047
 Look, Harvey,
 I've got a perfect setup.

308
00:16:56,082 --> 00:16:57,448
   Why spoil it
   by getting married?

309
00:16:57,484 --> 00:16:59,717
            Well, that's a very
            healthy outlook.
            But what about her?

310
00:16:59,753 --> 00:17:02,153
  No problem.
          All girls
          want to get married.

311
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:04,756
        I know. I've been
        subdivided three times.

312
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:08,593
 Not Toni Simmons.
 She thinks
 I'm already married.

313
00:17:08,628 --> 00:17:11,262
             Julian, you pulled
             that old stunt
             on her, huh?

314
00:17:11,297 --> 00:17:14,599
 The minute I met her,
 I knew this girl
 could make me do anything.

315
00:17:14,634 --> 00:17:17,368
 So just to protect myself
 in the clinches

316
00:17:17,404 --> 00:17:20,238
 I told her that I had
 a wife and three children.

317
00:17:20,273 --> 00:17:22,240
              Three children
              is a nice touch.

318
00:17:22,275 --> 00:17:23,941
 Yeah, and I told it to her
 right away

319
00:17:23,977 --> 00:17:26,944
 so that everything
 between us would be
 open and aboveboard.

320
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:28,513
          Very good. Very good.

321
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:32,517
      That's such a big, dirty,
      rotten, filthy lie,
      it has class.

322
00:17:33,953 --> 00:17:35,720
         (AIR HISSING)

323
00:17:35,755 --> 00:17:37,922
 I'm going to put this back
 temporarily.

324
00:17:37,957 --> 00:17:40,291
    It should hold you
    till next week.

325
00:17:43,096 --> 00:17:45,129
 All right, bite down hard.

326
00:17:45,165 --> 00:17:47,265
       That's it.
       Stay like that.

327
00:17:49,536 --> 00:17:51,769
  Would you give Mr. Greenfield
  another appointment?

328
00:17:51,805 --> 00:17:53,104
                   Yes, Doctor.

329
00:17:53,139 --> 00:17:55,039
 Uh, I know you won't
 have time to go out
 for lunch today

330
00:17:55,075 --> 00:17:58,476
 so I, I made you some
 of your favorite sandwiches,
 chicken and egg salad.

331
00:17:58,511 --> 00:17:59,544
                   Again?

332
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:02,747
 The way you always
 liked them.
                 If you say so.

333
00:18:02,782 --> 00:18:06,651
 Oh, Dr. Winston,
 I'm so terribly sorry
 I was late.

334
00:18:06,686 --> 00:18:09,587
     It's all right, dear lady.
     That is all right.

335
00:18:09,622 --> 00:18:12,290
       But I understand
       we've been very naughty.

336
00:18:12,325 --> 00:18:13,758
    Oh, I don't know
    about you,

337
00:18:13,793 --> 00:18:15,993
  but all I had
  was one little caramel.
          (BOTH CHUCKLING)

338
00:18:16,029 --> 00:18:18,396
              Besides being bad
              for your teeth,
              Mrs. Durant,

339
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:21,666
 think of how caramels
 can hurt
 those splendid hips.

340
00:18:21,701 --> 00:18:23,901
      Oh, isn't he
      a marvelous dentist?

341
00:18:23,937 --> 00:18:25,336
                       Great.

342
00:18:25,371 --> 00:18:27,939
  But with his talents
  he would have made
  an even better obstetrician.

343
00:18:27,974 --> 00:18:29,207
     In here, Mrs. Durant.

344
00:18:29,242 --> 00:18:30,608
    JULIAN:
    See you next week, Harv.

345
00:18:30,643 --> 00:18:32,376
             Now wait a minute.
             I listened to you
             about your girl.

346
00:18:32,412 --> 00:18:34,011
                Let me tell you
                about mine.
 I'm running a little...

347
00:18:34,047 --> 00:18:36,447
         She's a beautiful girl
         with a figure
         like a Greek goddess.

348
00:18:36,483 --> 00:18:38,182
       Yeah, yeah.
                Great, big,
                beautiful eyes.

349
00:18:38,218 --> 00:18:39,517
  Yeah, but her teeth
  need work.

350
00:18:39,552 --> 00:18:40,785
         They overlap a little,
         and I promised her...

351
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:42,820
 Harvey, you pulled this
 on me before.

352
00:18:42,856 --> 00:18:45,289
 MISS DICKINSON:
 Doctor, Mrs. Durant is ready.

353
00:18:45,325 --> 00:18:47,592
                   But, Julian,
                   old buddy...

354
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:49,994
  Oh, all right, send her in
  and I'll see what I can do.

355
00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:52,797
  But don't you know any girls
  with straight teeth?

356
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,736
     Excuse me, Sergeant...
     Uh, Miss Dickinson.

357
00:18:58,771 --> 00:19:02,273
     Dr. Winston asked me
     to make an appointment
     for a lady friend of mine.

358
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:05,409
     How about
     a week from Tuesday
     at 7:00 a.m.?

359
00:19:05,445 --> 00:19:07,578
        You're kidding.
        I'm asleep at 7:00 a.m.

360
00:19:07,614 --> 00:19:09,914
 Oh, I thought the appointment
 was for a lady.

361
00:19:09,949 --> 00:19:11,048
                  That's right.

362
00:19:11,084 --> 00:19:13,017
              We're both asleep
              at 7:00 a.m.

363
00:19:13,052 --> 00:19:14,418
                   (TITTERING)

364
00:19:14,454 --> 00:19:16,454
               I'm sorry.
               I hope I haven't
               shocked you.

365
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:18,823
 No, but it must be
 a terrible shock for her.

366
00:19:18,858 --> 00:19:21,058
  JULIAN:
  Will you get me
  Mrs. Durant's chart, please?

367
00:19:21,094 --> 00:19:23,194
 Yes, Doctor.

368
00:19:23,229 --> 00:19:26,264
 By the way, Mr. Greenfield,
 who is paying
 for this treatment?

369
00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:28,332
              HARVEY:
              Put it on my tab.

370
00:19:28,368 --> 00:19:30,268
 There is no more room
 on your tab.

371
00:19:30,303 --> 00:19:31,736
                HARVEY: Julian.

372
00:19:33,072 --> 00:19:34,472
             I feel insulted.

373
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:36,874
         It isn't as if I'm
         planning to stick you.

374
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:39,443
     It isn't as if
     you're planning
     to pay me, either.

375
00:19:42,382 --> 00:19:44,448
               Look, uh,

376
00:19:44,484 --> 00:19:46,717
   things are a little slow
   for actors
   this time of year.

377
00:19:46,753 --> 00:19:48,553
   But as soon as
   the new television
   season starts...

378
00:19:48,588 --> 00:19:51,222
      How about Thursday
      at 5:30 in the afternoon?

379
00:19:51,257 --> 00:19:52,623
          Or is that too early?

380
00:19:52,659 --> 00:19:54,959
 We'll set the alarm.

381
00:19:54,994 --> 00:19:58,196
    Uh, will you prepare
    an anesthetic syringe,
    please?

382
00:19:58,231 --> 00:19:59,363
                   Yes, Doctor.

383
00:19:59,399 --> 00:20:01,065
   You said something
   about a letter?
                  Yes.

384
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:04,368
            Oh, and by the way,
            your tailor called
            about your fitting.

385
00:20:04,404 --> 00:20:05,770
             That's something
             I can't do for you

386
00:20:05,805 --> 00:20:07,572
         any more than I can go
         to the barber for you,

387
00:20:07,607 --> 00:20:09,307
 which, by the way,
 you could also use.

388
00:20:09,342 --> 00:20:10,408
                Oh, my God!

389
00:20:10,443 --> 00:20:11,509
 What's wrong, Doctor?

390
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:13,010
           Why didn't you
           show me this before?

391
00:20:13,046 --> 00:20:14,478
 Well, I tried to, but...

392
00:20:15,315 --> 00:20:17,481
       Doctor! Doctor!

393
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:19,984
        Are you leaving?

394
00:20:20,019 --> 00:20:22,420
  What about Mrs. Durant
  and all the other patients?

395
00:20:22,455 --> 00:20:23,521
               You handle it.

396
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:25,022
 Doctor, really!

397
00:20:25,058 --> 00:20:27,692
 If your girlfriends
 start to come
 before your patients...

398
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:29,627
 Miss Dickinson, shut up!

00:20:31,698 --> 00:20:32,697
                     Oh!

401
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,107
        Dr. Winston's office.

402
00:20:43,142 --> 00:20:44,909
          No, he's not here.

403
00:20:46,012 --> 00:20:47,845
      Now, look, Mr. Sullivan,
      if it is that important,

404
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,314
          you'd better tell me
          about it.

405
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:55,019
         What? Toni is alive?
         Who is Toni? Hello?

406
00:20:55,054 --> 00:20:56,254
            Now, hello?

407

    (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

408
00:21:05,932 --> 00:21:09,033
  I didn't know dentists
  made house calls.

409
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:14,772
          I knew it. I knew it.
          I knew it!

410
00:21:15,141 --> 00:21:16,173
    Knew what?

411
00:21:16,209 --> 00:21:17,708
                That you
                wouldn't do it.

412
00:21:17,744 --> 00:21:20,444
       A whole day
       full of appointments,
       a dozen patients coming,

413
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,613
          and you send a letter
          that you're going
          to kill yourself

414
00:21:22,649 --> 00:21:23,681
               and then don't.

415
00:21:23,716 --> 00:21:25,416
 Well, I'm sorry
 to disappoint you.

416
00:21:25,451 --> 00:21:26,817
         The whole thing
         was a fake, wasn't it?

417
00:21:26,853 --> 00:21:29,153
    Everything between us
    is a fake, Julian.

418
00:21:29,188 --> 00:21:32,023
          Just because I broke
          one lousy little date
          last night?

419
00:21:32,058 --> 00:21:34,191
       It happens that I had
       a very important meeting

420
00:21:34,227 --> 00:21:35,359
    with an Australian dentist.

421
00:21:35,395 --> 00:21:37,395
  We were comparing techniques.

422
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:39,664
 Don't try to spare
 my feelings, Julian.

423
00:21:39,699 --> 00:21:42,233
    I know you were out
    with your wife.

424
00:21:43,569 --> 00:21:46,871
   Well, if you know, you know.

425
00:21:46,906 --> 00:21:49,674
 I've made up my mind, Julian.
 We're through.

426
00:21:49,709 --> 00:21:51,242
    Through?
    What are you talking about?

427
00:21:51,277 --> 00:21:52,410
      We're so happy together.

428
00:21:52,445 --> 00:21:54,045
      We are?
      Well, I'm happy together.

429
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,214
 I've decided I want a man
 of my own. Exclusively.

430
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:58,616
 No more going halfsies.

431
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:01,218
 So here. I packed
 your pajamas, your toothbrush,
 and your pic...

00:22:02,322 --> 00:22:03,754
 Toni, this isn't like you.

434
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:06,724
        Hi. Oh, I didn't know
        you had company.

00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:08,526
         It's only Julian.
         This is Igor Sullivan.

436
00:22:08,561 --> 00:22:11,329
     Hello, Dr. Winston,
     I just spoke to your nurse
     on the telephone.

437
00:22:11,364 --> 00:22:12,730
 Something wrong
 with your teeth?

438
00:22:12,765 --> 00:22:14,765
       No, I called to tell you
       Toni's alive

439
00:22:14,801 --> 00:22:16,567
       and you didn't have to
       worry about her letter.

440
00:22:16,602 --> 00:22:18,402
    Alive?
         You feeling all right,
         Toni?

441
00:22:18,438 --> 00:22:20,171
                  I'm fine.
                  Thanks, Igor.
                   Okay.

442
00:22:20,206 --> 00:22:23,207
  I wanted to make sure
  you weren't playing
  any more tricks with the gas.

443
00:22:23,242 --> 00:22:24,442
       Gas?
                   Gas.

444
00:22:24,477 --> 00:22:25,843
                        Gas.

445
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,213
 Toni, I'm a bastard.

446
00:22:29,248 --> 00:22:30,314
                    No, Julian.

447
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:31,582
 A no-good bastard.
                    Well...

448
00:22:31,617 --> 00:22:34,118
 You really tried
 to kill yourself over me?

449
00:22:34,153 --> 00:22:35,353
             Stupid, wasn't it?

450
00:22:35,388 --> 00:22:37,121
       I'm a bastard.

451
00:22:37,156 --> 00:22:40,524
 The biggest bastard
 in the whole world.

452
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,792
                Julian, please,

453
00:22:41,828 --> 00:22:44,795
     you're starting to make it
     sound like bragging.

454
00:22:46,199 --> 00:22:47,331
          It wasn't your fault.

455
00:22:47,367 --> 00:22:48,733
              I knew what I was
              getting into.

456
00:22:48,768 --> 00:22:50,735
          You've always told me
          the truth.

457
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:52,870
     I should've kept
     my mouth shut.

458
00:22:52,905 --> 00:22:54,805
          You couldn't, Julian.
          You're a decent guy.

459
00:22:54,841 --> 00:22:56,874
              That's why I fell
              in love with you.

460
00:22:56,909 --> 00:22:59,744
          Now I'm returning you
          to your wife
          and your children.

461
00:22:59,779 --> 00:23:01,612
             I hope you'll be
             very happy.

462
00:23:03,783 --> 00:23:06,951
     You know, Toni.
     Everything's going to
     be all right.

463
00:23:07,954 --> 00:23:10,354
     I'm going
     to make it up to you.

464
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:13,991
     Oh, sure.
     You'll take me away for
     another fun-filled weekend

465
00:23:14,026 --> 00:23:15,559
               at some motel.

466
00:23:15,595 --> 00:23:17,528
 No more weekends
 and no more motels.

467
00:23:17,563 --> 00:23:19,063
 Toni, I'm going to marry you.

468
00:23:20,299 --> 00:23:21,399
       How do you mean, marry?

469
00:23:21,434 --> 00:23:23,334
 You know, marry,
 with the judge,
 the blood test,

470
00:23:23,369 --> 00:23:25,569
 the license.
 That kind of marry.
 Right away.

471
00:23:25,605 --> 00:23:26,904
      But what about your wife?

472
00:23:26,939 --> 00:23:28,472
 My wife? I'll divorce her.

473
00:23:28,508 --> 00:23:29,540
       What about the children?

474
00:23:29,575 --> 00:23:30,674
   I'll divorce them, too.

475
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:31,942
      Julian, this isn't funny.

476
00:23:31,978 --> 00:23:33,544
 I should have done it
 a long time ago.

477
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:37,415
 Oh, baby, when I think
 that you were ready to
 die because of me...

478
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:40,818
         Oh, Julian,
         you really do love me.

479
00:23:40,853 --> 00:23:42,920
   Did you ever doubt it?

480
00:23:46,025 --> 00:23:47,091
          Julian, not now.

481
00:23:47,126 --> 00:23:48,125
         Why not now?

482
00:23:48,161 --> 00:23:50,795
        Igor's right next door.
        He can hear everything.

483
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:52,663
  Well, Igor's been
  right next door before.

484
00:23:52,698 --> 00:23:54,665
           Yeah, but I hadn't
           met him then.

485
00:23:56,302 --> 00:24:00,137
   Look, the sooner we move you
   out of here, the better.

486
00:24:00,173 --> 00:24:04,608
    Now that you're going to be
    Mrs. Julian Winston.

487
00:24:05,711 --> 00:24:09,413
             Imagine that.
             Me, a married man.

488
00:24:09,449 --> 00:24:11,215
            I mean,
            me, married to you.

489
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:14,318
 Julian, wha-wha-what's
 going to become of her?

490
00:24:14,353 --> 00:24:15,719
         Your wife.

491
00:24:15,755 --> 00:24:18,489
         Why do we keep talking
         about my wife?

492
00:24:18,524 --> 00:24:21,559
     Well, you're going to
     have to make some
     arrangements about her.

493
00:24:21,594 --> 00:24:22,827
      What do you
      figure on doing?

494
00:24:22,862 --> 00:24:24,395
              Simple. Hup, out!

495
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:27,431
      Oh, is that what
      you'll say when
      you get tired of me?

496
00:24:27,467 --> 00:24:28,566
        "Hup, out"?

497
00:24:28,601 --> 00:24:31,735
         No, this is different,
         darling.

498
00:24:31,771 --> 00:24:33,137
              I'm, I love you.

499
00:24:33,172 --> 00:24:35,739
         My wife and I...
         I never even knew her.

500
00:24:35,775 --> 00:24:39,510
 How did
 the three children come?
 United Parcel?

501
00:24:39,545 --> 00:24:41,946
         Well, at the beginning
         I was polite.

502
00:24:41,981 --> 00:24:44,815
        Look, will you stop
        worrying about my wife?

503
00:24:44,851 --> 00:24:46,984
       She'll be taken care of.

504
00:24:48,054 --> 00:24:51,021
  What if she refuses
  to give you a divorce?

505
00:24:51,057 --> 00:24:53,724
             She wouldn't dare.
             Let's forget her.

506
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:55,025
          I can't.

507
00:24:55,061 --> 00:24:57,228
   I can't. The thought
   of being a housebreaker

508
00:24:57,263 --> 00:24:59,296
    sort of spoils things.

509
00:24:59,332 --> 00:25:02,600
     A home-breaker.
     A housebreaker is a crook.

510
00:25:02,635 --> 00:25:06,036
 Well, I'm stealing you
 away from your wife.

511
00:25:06,072 --> 00:25:08,973
 You may not believe it,
 but I have
 certain standards.

512
00:25:09,008 --> 00:25:11,809
         Toni, I haven't wanted
         to go into this,

513
00:25:11,844 --> 00:25:13,744
         but what if I told you

514
00:25:13,779 --> 00:25:16,247
         that it's my wife
         who wants the divorce?

515
00:25:16,282 --> 00:25:19,049
 Oh, God. You mean
 she found out about us?

516
00:25:19,085 --> 00:25:23,287
            Let's just say that
            she wants
            her freedom, too.

517
00:25:23,322 --> 00:25:27,424
 Oh. Well, in that case,
 I'll be proud
 to marry you.

518
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:28,959
            (MUFFLED) Oh, baby.

 are you doing there?

       Fixing Toni's window.

526
00:25:44,176 --> 00:25:45,876
        Because if she waits
        till the janitor
        gets around to it,

527
00:25:45,912 --> 00:25:47,811

 Ah, but we Latins
 have a great eye
 for hidden beauty.

 our women
 were all covered up

   with mantillas,
   long dresses, veils.

 So we, in self-defense,
 have had to
 develop an instinct

00:29:24,964 --> 00:29:26,396
   for guessing
   what was underneath.

 You're a married man.

          If I'm a married man,
          it is my problem.

629
00:29:58,864 --> 00:30:00,097
            What has it
            got to do with you?

630
00:30:00,132 --> 00:30:02,366
      I would not be prejudiced
      if you were married.

631
00:30:03,202 --> 00:30:04,968
          Señor Sanchez,
          how are you?

632
00:30:05,004 --> 00:30:06,336
      Come, come.
      I can take you now.

633

        take you now.

          know I would.

 in a jam.

    Is... Uh, are you
    in a hurry this evening?

00:30:57,790 --> 00:31:01,458

   Why, no, if there's anything
   I can do for you...

650
00:31:01,493 --> 00:31:04,595
     I thought maybe
     you'd like to come out
     and have a drink with me.

 MISS DICKINSON: What?

652
00:31:10,369 --> 00:31:13,170
   Are you asking me to go out?

653
00:31:13,205 --> 00:31:15,639
    Why? Is there somebody else
    in that closet?

 I don't understand.

 that you have ever invited me.

659
00:31:34,193 --> 00:31:36,627
     Well, better a little late
     than a little never.

660
00:31:47,172 --> 00:31:50,707
 And I suddenly realized
 that I have no idea...

661
00:31:50,743 --> 00:31:53,543
 (CHUCKLING)

662
00:31:53,579 --> 00:31:57,314
 ...of what your life is like
 outside the office.

663
00:31:57,349 --> 00:32:00,284
 Tell me about
 Stephanie Dickinson,
 civilian.

664
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:02,185
                I, I don't know
                where to begin.

665
00:32:02,221 --> 00:32:03,587
 That's a good place.

666
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:06,957
            Well, I, I live
            in Jackson Heights.

667
00:32:06,992 --> 00:32:08,258
 That much I know.
 Alone?

668
00:32:08,294 --> 00:32:11,895
     Um, yes. No, no.
     I live with my sister Anna

669
00:32:11,931 --> 00:32:13,897
             and her husband
             and their two boys

670
00:32:13,933 --> 00:32:16,600
           and uh,
           a bulldog named Max.

671
00:32:16,635 --> 00:32:18,168
   Sounds cozy.

672
00:32:18,203 --> 00:32:20,137
                Yes. I like
                large families.

673
00:32:21,507 --> 00:32:23,640
            And uh, I help Anna
            with the cooking.

674
00:32:23,676 --> 00:32:26,910
     And after dinner
     I walk the dog, or I read,

675
00:32:26,946 --> 00:32:30,047
            watch television,
            if there's
            a good documentary.

676
00:32:30,082 --> 00:32:31,949
              And sometimes
              we play Monopoly.

677
00:32:31,984 --> 00:32:33,483
 Monopoly. That's fun.

678
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:37,187
      And my, my brother-in-law
      is very good at it,
      but he cheats.

679
00:32:37,222 --> 00:32:40,924
        Um, then on Saturdays
        I take
        my two nephews to town.

680
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,361
         We go to... To the zoo
         or the park.

681
00:32:44,396 --> 00:32:46,863
 What do you do
 on your vacation?

682
00:32:46,899 --> 00:32:48,966
       Oh, that's when I become
       a different person.

683
00:32:49,001 --> 00:32:51,068
               Independent
               and adventurous.

684
00:32:51,103 --> 00:32:53,070
             I saddle up
             my little Volvo...

685
00:32:53,105 --> 00:32:54,271
 Volvo? That's a good car.

686
00:32:54,306 --> 00:32:56,106
        Yeah,
        well, it's second-hand.

687
00:32:56,141 --> 00:32:57,441
             Well, I break away
             from everything

688
00:32:57,476 --> 00:32:59,142
              and go tooling up
              to Cape Cod.

689
00:32:59,178 --> 00:33:00,277
       Alone?

690
00:33:00,312 --> 00:33:02,145
           Yes. Just me,
           my paintbox and Max.

691
00:33:02,181 --> 00:33:04,014
            Max?
                       The dog.

692
00:33:04,049 --> 00:33:05,582
           Oh.

693
00:33:05,617 --> 00:33:09,019
       For the two weeks,
       I, I wear blue jeans
       and walk around barefoot

694
00:33:09,054 --> 00:33:11,188
          and paint up a storm.

695
00:33:11,223 --> 00:33:14,758
 What about your personal life?
 I mean, uh, uh...

696
00:33:15,227 --> 00:33:16,526
               You mean men?

697
00:33:16,562 --> 00:33:17,627
    Yes.

698
00:33:18,864 --> 00:33:21,665
   At, at the moment,
   there are no men in my life.

699
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,200
     But there have been?

700
00:33:23,235 --> 00:33:26,269
            Well, Doctor,
            I'm no sex goddess,
            but, uh,

701
00:33:26,305 --> 00:33:29,473
             I haven't spent
             my life in a tree.

702
00:33:29,508 --> 00:33:33,110
        I was married
        when I was very young,
        but it didn't work out.

703
00:33:33,145 --> 00:33:34,945
    Married? I had no idea.

704
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,146
              Neither did he.

705
00:33:36,181 --> 00:33:37,314
             (BREATHING DEEPLY)

706
00:33:37,349 --> 00:33:39,216
       And once
       I was very much in love.

707
00:33:39,251 --> 00:33:41,518
            It lasted for
            a long time, but...

708
00:33:41,887 --> 00:33:43,120
 But?

709
00:33:43,155 --> 00:33:45,589
            Well, he couldn't
            leave his wife.

710
00:33:45,991 --> 00:33:47,624
           Him, too.

711
00:33:47,659 --> 00:33:49,826
              What do you mean,
              "Him, too"?

712
00:33:49,862 --> 00:33:53,497
 Oh, nothing. I was thinking
 of a similar case.

713
00:33:53,532 --> 00:33:57,667
        In this job,
        you don't meet anything
        but married men.

714
00:33:57,703 --> 00:34:01,071
  I suppose all the single ones
  have good teeth. (LAUGHS)

   (PIANO PLAYING
   IN THE BACKGROUND)

716
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:04,941
      Frankly, I hadn't planned
      on being an old maid.

717
00:34:04,977 --> 00:34:08,145
 An old maid? Nonsense.
 You've got
 a long way to go.

718
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:09,813
           Well, I've been
           talking an awful lot

719
00:34:09,848 --> 00:34:11,915
       and I'm afraid
       I'll be late for dinner.

720
00:34:13,052 --> 00:34:14,718
 Miss Dickinson.

721
00:34:18,557 --> 00:34:20,824
 I'm glad we had
 this little talk.

722
00:34:20,859 --> 00:34:23,894
 You're a very rare person,
 sensitive and generous.

723
00:34:24,696 --> 00:34:27,330
                 Well, I guess
                 I'm all right.

724
00:34:27,366 --> 00:34:30,067
 I have a feeling
 that if I found myself
 in trouble,

725
00:34:30,102 --> 00:34:32,369
 I could count on you
 for help.

726
00:34:32,404 --> 00:34:34,137
           But you know
           that's true, Doctor.

727
00:34:34,173 --> 00:34:37,307
 But sometimes
 a problem comes up
 that's so difficult

728
00:34:37,342 --> 00:34:39,409
    that, uh...
          Why don't you try me?

729
00:34:44,383 --> 00:34:45,816
 (SNAPS FINGER)

730
00:34:48,053 --> 00:34:51,188
     Miss Dickinson,
     you could do me
     a great service.

731
00:34:51,223 --> 00:34:54,291
    You see I'm desperately
    in need of a wife.

732
00:34:55,994 --> 00:34:57,227
            Oh, Doctor.

733
00:34:57,262 --> 00:34:58,895
   Oh, please,
   don't misunderstand me.

734
00:34:58,931 --> 00:34:59,963
          I never expected...

735
00:34:59,998 --> 00:35:03,300
 Oh, I need a wife temporarily,
 15 or 20 minutes.

736
00:35:04,136 --> 00:35:06,136
             15 or 20 minutes?

737
00:35:06,171 --> 00:35:07,838
   I'm telling all of this
   very badly.

738
00:35:07,873 --> 00:35:11,408
    Miss, Dickinson,
    I want someone to play
    the part of my wife.

739
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:13,743
             Someone like me.

740
00:35:13,779 --> 00:35:14,945
 If only you would.

741
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:17,647
 It wouldn't involve
 any, uh, I mean, uh...

742
00:35:17,683 --> 00:35:21,918
 All, all you'd have to do
 is tell a certain person
 that, uh, you want a divorce.

743
00:35:21,954 --> 00:35:23,987
    You see,
    I've suddenly decided
    to get married.

744
00:35:24,022 --> 00:35:25,222
 I guess
 I didn't tell you.

745
00:35:25,257 --> 00:35:27,257
                No. No, you
                didn't tell me.

746
00:35:27,292 --> 00:35:29,726
 Well, I have.
 Her name is Toni Simmons.

747
00:35:29,761 --> 00:35:32,129
         Oh, I'm supposed
         to give you a message.

748
00:35:32,164 --> 00:35:33,563
                   She's alive.

749
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:35,098
 Well, that's only
 part of it.

750
00:35:35,134 --> 00:35:37,834
 See, my problem is
 she thinks
 I'm already married.

751
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:40,237
           Where could she have
           gotten such an idea?

752
00:35:40,272 --> 00:35:42,405
 Well, at the time,
 I had my reasons.

753
00:35:42,441 --> 00:35:44,241
 But, uh, I'll straighten
 that out later.

754
00:35:44,276 --> 00:35:46,243
 At the moment,
 I have to dig up a wife.

755
00:35:46,278 --> 00:35:49,513
  Well, right now, stop digging
  and tell the girl
  the truth. Good night.

756
00:35:49,548 --> 00:35:51,781
 Well, I can't tell her
 anything now,
 Miss Dickinson.

757
00:35:51,817 --> 00:35:53,150
 She's liable to...

758
00:35:53,185 --> 00:35:54,484
 Well, she's so young

759
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:57,287
 and she's had
 a lot of unfortunate
 experiences.

760

 she's ever met.

761

         Are you quoting her,
         or you?

762
00:36:04,229 --> 00:36:05,795
 Toni is a wonderful girl.

763
00:36:05,831 --> 00:36:08,031
 She won't get married
 unless she meets my wife.

764
00:36:08,066 --> 00:36:11,001
 I mean, she's straightforward,
 she doesn't want to
 be a housebreaker.

765
00:36:11,036 --> 00:36:13,703
  I mean, a house-wrecker.
  Isn't that sweet?

               Just darling.

767
00:36:14,706 --> 00:36:16,439
 She works at Stereo Heaven
 in the Village.

768
00:36:16,475 --> 00:36:18,341
 And if you would
 just go and meet her...

769
00:36:18,377 --> 00:36:20,010
             Doctor. I'm sorry.
             I hate lies.

770
00:36:20,045 --> 00:36:24,080
  No more than I do,
  Miss Dickinson,
  no more than I.

771
00:36:24,116 --> 00:36:26,416
 But I don't know
 how to
 get out of this one.

00:36:26,451 --> 00:36:29,219

  lies in your two hands.

     have held nothing

     and your appointment book.

           to use me in this...

      In this contemptible way.

778
00:36:44,803 --> 00:36:46,903
      You just tricked me
      into talking about myself
      so that...

779
00:36:46,939 --> 00:36:50,106

      wasn't very nice, Doctor.

 you're a very gracious,

919

         I thought it was Toni.

920
00:44:32,470 --> 00:44:33,836
 What if it had been?

921
00:44:33,872 --> 00:44:36,839
       I just, I wanted to get
       my electric razor
       out of her apartment.

922
00:44:36,875 --> 00:44:38,741
 Why would it be in there?

923
00:44:38,777 --> 00:44:41,644
        Because you can't
        slash your wrists
        with an electric razor.

924
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:43,513
          I took all her blades
          away from her.

925
00:44:43,548 --> 00:44:45,815
 I wish you'd butt out

 For your information, sir,
 Toni and I are
 getting married.

            She didn't tell me.

 Thanks, Igor.
 It'll take a while yet.

      there's the divorce.

 Oh, we haven't
 gotten our divorce yet?

     Would you give Tarzan here
     his electric razor?

 Oh, I'm sorry, Igor.
 I should have
 returned it.

00:45:19,784 --> 00:45:21,517
  So, you haven't
  gotten the divorce yet?

942

         I'd like to have you
         in my chair

    don't come calling
    in that outfit.

  How come you're so late?

948
00:45:34,599 --> 00:45:38,501
    Julian, I had a visitor
    at the shop this afternoon.
    Your wife.

949
00:45:38,536 --> 00:45:40,136
           She came?

950
00:45:40,171 --> 00:45:41,404
           She was magnificent.

951
00:45:41,439 --> 00:45:44,440
   Handled herself beautifully.
   She's a real lady.

952
00:45:44,476 --> 00:45:47,210
      Well, I don't marry
      just anybody.

953
00:45:47,245 --> 00:45:48,911
       Then everything
       is all cleared up?

954
00:45:48,947 --> 00:45:50,313
        Julian, you lied to me.

955
00:45:50,348 --> 00:45:53,149
     What? Never!
     What did she tell you?
     I deny it.

956
00:45:53,184 --> 00:45:54,917
     Well, you may not be aware
     of it yourself, Julian,

957
00:45:54,953 --> 00:45:57,053
             but your wife
             still loves you.

958
00:45:57,388 --> 00:45:58,354
         Hmm?

959
00:45:58,389 --> 00:46:00,723
     I'm telling you,
     your wife still loves you.

960
00:46:00,759 --> 00:46:02,425
                 Now, did she
                 or did she not

961
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:04,327
           tell you that she
           agrees to a divorce?

962
00:46:04,362 --> 00:46:06,596
 But she's only doing it
 to make you happy.

963
00:46:06,631 --> 00:46:09,165
 She's crazy about you.
 Anybody can see that.

         Toni, let's stay calm.

965
00:46:10,535 --> 00:46:13,436
          Tell me
          what the damn fool...
          What my wife said.

966
00:46:13,471 --> 00:46:16,239
 Well, it's not what she said,
 it's what she didn't say.

967
00:46:16,274 --> 00:46:19,242
           All right, tell me
           what she didn't say.
           Word for word.

968
00:46:19,277 --> 00:46:21,544
 Well, it was the way
 she talked about you,

969
00:46:21,579 --> 00:46:24,514
  and your barber,
  and your shirts,
  and your handkerchiefs.

970
00:46:24,549 --> 00:46:26,682
 I got all choked up.

971
00:46:26,718 --> 00:46:30,720
 And she mentioned
 those chicken and
 egg salad sandwiches.

972
00:46:30,755 --> 00:46:33,990
    You mean to say she bragged
    about her damn sandwiches?

973
00:46:34,025 --> 00:46:36,259
    She didn't brag.
    She just told me
    she made them.

974
00:46:36,294 --> 00:46:38,394
 It sounded as if
 they were made with love.

975
00:46:38,429 --> 00:46:41,364
       Well, they were made
       with mayonnaise.
       And too much mayonnaise.

976
00:46:41,399 --> 00:46:42,899
             And next time
             she gives me one,

977
00:46:42,934 --> 00:46:45,301
         I'm going to smack her
         right across the mouth
         with it.

978
00:46:45,336 --> 00:46:48,171

 streak in you.

              my wife's lawyer.

981
00:46:52,210 --> 00:46:55,111
        Uh, Toni, you wanted
        to see her. I fixed it.

982
00:46:55,146 --> 00:46:57,180
 Well, that was
 a mistake.
                    Great.

983
00:46:57,215 --> 00:46:59,849
 Maybe if
 I never met her...

984
00:46:59,884 --> 00:47:01,984
 But I did meet her,
 and I liked her.

985
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:04,220
 Especially after
 I saw her
 with the children.

986
00:47:04,255 --> 00:47:06,689
      The children?
      She brought the children?

987
00:47:06,724 --> 00:47:09,125
   (SIGHS) They were waiting
   for her across the street.

988
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:11,661
           Not the little girl,
           just the two boys.

989
00:47:12,797 --> 00:47:14,397
  Must be those damn nephews.

990
00:47:14,432 --> 00:47:17,099
              Incidentally,
              how old is Peter?

991
00:47:18,536 --> 00:47:19,502
         Peter?

992
00:47:19,537 --> 00:47:21,938
       Peter, that's your
       older boy, isn't it?

993
00:47:21,973 --> 00:47:24,140
     (CHUCKLING) Oh! Yeah.

994
00:47:24,175 --> 00:47:27,410
      Yes, that's, uh,
      Peter all right.

995
00:47:27,445 --> 00:47:30,279
   Well, let's see, how old
   would he be now? Um...

996
00:47:30,315 --> 00:47:32,715
                  You told me
                  he was eight.

997
00:47:32,750 --> 00:47:35,451
        Well, if that's
        what I told you.

998
00:47:35,486 --> 00:47:38,120
           Well, he looked more
           like 12 to me.

999
00:47:39,624 --> 00:47:41,657
 Yes, well... No, it's...

1000
00:47:41,693 --> 00:47:45,895
  It's the younger boy
  who's eight.
  Peter, uh... Peter is 12.

1001
00:47:45,930 --> 00:47:47,530
       That's very interesting,

1002
00:47:47,565 --> 00:47:50,399
        considering you've only
        been married 10 years.

1003
00:47:52,003 --> 00:47:54,270
               Come on, Julian,
               the truth.

1004
00:47:56,107 --> 00:47:58,341
 Well, all right.

1005
00:47:58,376 --> 00:48:01,310
 The truth is that Peter
 was a premature baby.

1006
00:48:01,346 --> 00:48:03,446
 He was born
 before we were married.

1007
00:48:05,383 --> 00:48:08,050
      I'm glad.
      That confirms everything.

1008
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:09,852
      How's that?

1009
00:48:09,888 --> 00:48:11,487
                 Don't you see?

1010
00:48:11,522 --> 00:48:13,289
       Here's a woman
       who gave herself to you
       before you were married.

1011
00:48:13,324 --> 00:48:15,424
              That proves
              it was true love.

1012
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:17,360
   Oh, for
   God's sake, Toni.

1013
00:48:17,395 --> 00:48:19,962
        And I'd feel guilty
        if I did anything to...

1014
00:48:19,998 --> 00:48:25,268
 Toni, I told you
 that she wants the divorce
 as much as I do.

1015

 a very good reason.

1016

              TONI:
              What good reason?

1017
00:48:29,707 --> 00:48:31,707
 What good reason? Huh!

1018
00:48:33,077 --> 00:48:34,744
         Oh, boy!

00:48:36,014 --> 00:48:37,446
         (SNORTS)

1020
00:48:37,482 --> 00:48:39,115
       Another guy.

1021
00:48:39,150 --> 00:48:42,752
    Your wife? Another man?
    I'd be very much surprised.

1022
00:48:42,787 --> 00:48:45,554
        Toni, that's
        the kind of thing
        a man with a normal ego

1023
00:48:45,590 --> 00:48:46,989
     wouldn't lie about.

1024
00:48:47,025 --> 00:48:48,491
      Well, maybe you're right.

1025
00:48:48,526 --> 00:48:50,493
               Knowing the fact
               that you've been
               cheated on,

1026
00:48:50,528 --> 00:48:53,195
         that you wife did that
         to you, makes it all
         seem nicer somehow.

1027
00:48:53,231 --> 00:48:54,363
      Just as long
      as you're happy.

1028
00:48:54,399 --> 00:48:55,998
              Why shouldn't she
              have a boyfriend?

1029
00:48:56,034 --> 00:48:57,466
               After all, you
               have a mistress.

1030
00:48:57,502 --> 00:48:58,668
          You nut.

1031
00:48:58,703 --> 00:49:01,203
       Julian, if we're going
       to dinner and a movie...

1032
00:49:01,239 --> 00:49:03,806
 Why don't we stay in tonight
 and scramble something?

1033
00:49:03,841 --> 00:49:05,708
         I don't think we ought
         to do this anymore.

1034
00:49:05,743 --> 00:49:08,110
       What?
      Well, now that
      you're getting a divorce,

1035
00:49:08,146 --> 00:49:09,445
                 we ought to be
                 more careful.

1036
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:11,047
          We wouldn't want this
          to get messy.

1037
00:49:11,082 --> 00:49:12,415
      Of course not.
      But, baby...

1038
00:49:12,450 --> 00:49:14,617
        It's only for six weeks
        while your wife
        goes to Reno.

1039
00:49:14,652 --> 00:49:16,819
 Reno? Hell, I'm going
 to send her to Mexico

1040
00:49:16,854 --> 00:49:18,187
     for one of those

00:54:56,994 --> 00:54:59,828
        (LAUGHS) Oh,
        you really are a louse.

1166
00:55:01,799 --> 00:55:04,900
 A Scotch and water
 and a Scotch and soda, please.

1167
00:55:15,780 --> 00:55:18,314
        Julian, don't look now,
        but it's your wife.

1168
00:55:18,349 --> 00:55:20,582
 My wife? Nonsense.

1169
00:55:20,618 --> 00:55:23,118
      No, I'm sure that's her
      over there with that man.

1170
00:55:25,089 --> 00:55:28,390
 Yes, that's my wife,
 all right.
 And with her boyfriend.

1171
00:55:28,426 --> 00:55:30,559
 Well, what do you know
 about that?

1172
00:55:30,594 --> 00:55:32,695
      Oh, this is embarrassing.

1173
00:55:32,730 --> 00:55:34,730
 Well, you insisted
 on seeing him.

1174
00:55:34,765 --> 00:55:37,099
         I know, but now I feel
         like a spy. Let's go.

1175
00:55:37,134 --> 00:55:37,966
       Okay.

1176
00:55:38,002 --> 00:55:39,101
                 Look, as long
                 as we're here,

1177
00:55:39,136 --> 00:55:42,271
          how do you know
          that's her boyfriend?

1178
00:55:42,306 --> 00:55:46,041
 Well, who else could it be?
 Besides, look at them.

1179
00:55:51,716 --> 00:55:53,849
    They act very affectionate.

1180
00:55:55,953 --> 00:55:57,553
    Yes, they do.

1181
00:55:58,556 --> 00:56:00,956
 I thought she
 only played Monopoly.

1182
00:56:03,928 --> 00:56:07,162
 Hey, go easy on that stuff.
 I'm not sure
 I can pay for it.

1183
00:56:07,198 --> 00:56:08,564
                 Don't worry.

1184
00:56:08,599 --> 00:56:11,300
      Dr. Winston gave me money
      to pay for the check.

1185
00:56:13,204 --> 00:56:14,703
      Thank you.

1186
00:56:24,014 --> 00:56:25,881
            I don't think
            they've noticed us.

1187
00:56:25,916 --> 00:56:28,417
             We'd better
             push things a bit.
             Let's dance.

1188
00:56:28,452 --> 00:56:31,286
           But when I
           asked you before ...
       Shut up and dance.

1189
00:56:39,296 --> 00:56:40,896
 She dances, too.

1190
00:56:40,931 --> 00:56:44,166
     Everything about your wife
     seems to surprise you.

1191
00:56:44,201 --> 00:56:47,569
 Oh, it's been so long
 since we've
 really communicated.

1192
00:56:47,605 --> 00:56:49,905
           Come on, I want to
           look at them closer.

1193
00:56:50,775 --> 00:56:52,908
   (MUSIC CONTINUES PLAYING)

1194
00:56:54,145 --> 00:56:55,244
        Your hand!

1195
00:56:55,279 --> 00:56:56,378
          Look, I'm only human.

1196
00:56:56,414 --> 00:56:58,247
       Barely.

1197
00:56:58,282 --> 00:56:59,815
            Oh, sorry.
             Oh, hello, Julian.

1198
00:56:59,850 --> 00:57:01,183
 Talk about coincidence.

1199
00:57:01,218 --> 00:57:02,718
 Good evening,
 Mrs. Winston.
                  Good evening.

1200
00:57:02,753 --> 00:57:04,553
       I want you to meet my...
              Hi, honey.

1201
00:57:04,588 --> 00:57:06,555
         I'm Harvey Greenfield,
         her boyfriend.

1202
00:57:06,590 --> 00:57:08,023
            Harvey,
            this is my husband.

1203
00:57:08,058 --> 00:57:10,692
    Good to meet you, old man.
    I've heard a lot about you.

1204
00:57:10,728 --> 00:57:13,162
 Join us for a drink?
                 No. Well, I...

1205
00:57:13,197 --> 00:57:15,297
   Well, after all,
   we are civilized people,

1206
00:57:15,332 --> 00:57:17,499
   unless, of course,
   you two
   prefer to be alone?

1207
00:57:17,535 --> 00:57:20,335
       Hell, no! I mean,
       we are civilized people.

1208
00:57:20,371 --> 00:57:23,772
           Look, why don't you
           come to our table?
           This party's on me.

1209
00:57:27,044 --> 00:57:29,278
      What do you think of him?
 Ask me later.

1210
00:57:31,649 --> 00:57:33,615
 It's strange to see you
 in a nightclub.

1211
00:57:33,651 --> 00:57:35,517
 I didn't realize
 you were such a swinger.

1212
00:57:35,553 --> 00:57:37,886
       Oh, you never
       really knew me, my dear.

1213
00:57:37,922 --> 00:57:39,721
         Can we have
         some more glasses
         over here, please?

1214
00:57:39,757 --> 00:57:41,256
            Julian thinks of me
            as a homebody

1215
00:57:41,292 --> 00:57:44,326
       because of all the years
       I was trapped
       by the children.

1216
00:57:44,361 --> 00:57:45,928
        Of course.

1217
00:57:46,964 --> 00:57:49,298
 By the way, Mr. Greenfield,
                 Yes?

1218
00:57:49,333 --> 00:57:51,266
      How do
      you like children?

1219
00:57:51,302 --> 00:57:52,601
              Barbecued.

1220
00:57:52,636 --> 00:57:55,337
              (CHUCKLING)

1221
00:57:55,372 --> 00:57:59,308
   That's the kind of joke
   made by a man who is trying
   to hide his feelings.

1222
00:57:59,343 --> 00:58:01,643
   JULIAN:
   Deep down, I know
   you really love children.

1223
00:58:01,679 --> 00:58:03,245
     Huh?
                   Deep down.

1224
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:06,515
 Oh, yeah. Oh, deep down.
 Yes, yes, especially yours.

1225
00:58:06,550 --> 00:58:07,850
 I'm nuts about them.

1226
00:58:07,885 --> 00:58:11,186
   Mr. Greenfield,
   uh, what kind of work
   do you do?

1227
00:58:11,222 --> 00:58:13,422
         Oh, I don't work
         for a living, honey,
         I'm an actor.

1228
00:58:13,457 --> 00:58:15,224
                 Why don't you
                 pour the wine?

1229
00:58:15,259 --> 00:58:19,228
 An actor? Isn't that
 a very insecure profession?

1230
00:58:19,263 --> 00:58:21,296
 Only financially.

1231
00:58:21,332 --> 00:58:23,799
         That's quite a girl
         you got there, Julian.

1232
00:58:23,834 --> 00:58:26,635
       I hear it's going to
       happen very soon
       between you two.

1233
00:58:26,670 --> 00:58:27,936
 As soon as
 we can make it.

1234
00:58:27,972 --> 00:58:29,538
    Julian, I hardly think
    it's the moment to...

1235
00:58:29,573 --> 00:58:32,841
 Come on, now, Toni.
 We have nothing to hide
 from these people.

1236
00:58:32,877 --> 00:58:35,077
 Yeah, it's all
 in the family.

1237
00:58:35,112 --> 00:58:37,779
 Stephanie and I
 have nothing to hide
 from each other either.

1238
00:58:37,815 --> 00:58:38,981
            Oh please,
            change the subject.

1239
00:58:39,016 --> 00:58:40,482
 Look at her blushing.
 Isn't she cute?

1240
00:58:40,518 --> 00:58:43,185
              Really, Harvey...
 She acts kind of
 cold in public

1241
00:58:43,220 --> 00:58:45,654
 but when we're alone
 together, oh, boy.

1242
00:58:45,689 --> 00:58:47,756
       I forgot you knew her
       as well as I do.

1243
00:58:47,791 --> 00:58:48,991
          She's absolutely...
             (LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)

1244
00:58:49,026 --> 00:58:50,559
 Let's have
 another drink.

1245
00:58:50,594 --> 00:58:52,094
          The party's dying.

1246
00:58:52,129 --> 00:58:56,164
 Oh, there you are, Harvey.
 I'm sorry I'm late, honey.

1247
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:57,499
         Hello, everybody.

1248
00:58:59,203 --> 00:59:00,569
            Won't you sit down?

1249
00:59:00,604 --> 00:59:03,272
      No, she doesn't want to.
      We have to talk now.
      It's business.

1250
00:59:03,307 --> 00:59:06,475
 Well, did we have
 a date, or didn't we?

1251
00:59:06,510 --> 00:59:09,745
 Please excuse us, folks.
 She's the daughter
 of my TV sponsor.

1252
00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:12,414
 Silly debutante.
 I'll be right back.

1253
00:59:12,449 --> 00:59:13,682
 What are you
 trying to pull?

1254
00:59:13,717 --> 00:59:15,817
      Quiet, or you'll be stuck
      with your old teeth.

1255
00:59:18,522 --> 00:59:20,355
 Uh, would you
 excuse me, please?

1256
00:59:20,391 --> 00:59:22,457
 I'll go and
 powder my nose.

1257
00:59:22,493 --> 00:59:23,659
                Do you want me
                to go with you?

1258
00:59:23,694 --> 00:59:25,561
 No, dear.
 I'm all right.

1259
00:59:25,596 --> 00:59:28,463
        (MUSIC PLAYING)

1260
00:59:31,769 --> 00:59:33,168
                  Well, Julian.

1261
00:59:33,203 --> 00:59:34,303
  What's wrong?

1262
00:59:34,338 --> 00:59:35,437
                    He's a bum.

1263
00:59:35,472 --> 00:59:36,705
 Oh, I wouldn't
 say that.

1264
00:59:36,740 --> 00:59:38,707
          You didn't catch it,
          but earlier I saw her

1265
00:59:38,742 --> 00:59:40,576
         slip some money to him
         under the table.

1266
00:59:40,611 --> 00:59:42,110
  That doesn't
  mean anything.

1267
00:59:42,146 --> 00:59:44,012
             Did you get a load
             of that girl?

1268
00:59:44,048 --> 00:59:45,714
 Well, I wasn't paying
 much attention.

1269
00:59:45,749 --> 00:59:50,218
     When she bent over
     it looked like she had her
     knees up inside her dress.

1270
00:59:51,422 --> 00:59:53,855
     Now look, I could give you
     a dozen explanations,

1271
00:59:53,891 --> 00:59:55,791
          but you might as well
          know the real one.

1272
00:59:55,826 --> 00:59:57,426
                   I'm a member
                   of the CIA.

1273
00:59:57,461 --> 00:59:58,827
       The CIA?

1274
00:59:58,862 --> 01:00:00,762
 I thought you were
 a television actor.

1275
01:00:00,798 --> 01:00:02,130
               That's my cover.

1276
01:00:02,166 --> 01:00:04,166
         So, if you ever see me
         in public
         with another girl,

1277
01:00:04,201 --> 01:00:05,400
               you must pretend
               not to know me

1278
01:00:05,436 --> 01:00:07,636
               or it could
               put my life
               in great danger.

1279
01:00:07,671 --> 01:00:10,172
 Oh, I wouldn't want
 to do that.

1280
01:00:12,476 --> 01:00:14,543
 It doesn't matter
 what we think of him.

1281
01:00:14,578 --> 01:00:16,178
   It's my wife
   who loves him.

1282
01:00:16,213 --> 01:00:18,914
      Loves him? Didn't you see
      how humiliated she was?

1283
01:00:18,949 --> 01:00:20,048
 Well, Toni, I...

1284
01:00:20,084 --> 01:00:21,583
 What do you want me
 to do about it?

1285
01:00:21,619 --> 01:00:23,685
        We have got to save her
        from that man.

1286
01:00:23,721 --> 01:00:27,489
 Toni, the man
 probably had a little
 too much to drink.

1287
01:00:27,524 --> 01:00:29,224
                Why do you keep
                defending him?

1288
01:00:29,259 --> 01:00:31,627
            I'm angry enough
            because you were
            so chummy with him.

1289
01:00:31,662 --> 01:00:34,863
    Julian, my respect for you
    is going down every minute.

1290
01:00:35,899 --> 01:00:38,166
            Hey, is the party
            still going on?

1291
01:00:39,303 --> 01:00:41,236
      Not for you,
      Mr. Greenfield.
                  Huh?

1292
01:00:41,271 --> 01:00:42,904
 I don't like the way
 you treated my wife.

1293
01:00:42,940 --> 01:00:44,439
            A joke's a joke.

1294
01:00:44,475 --> 01:00:46,375
 And I don't like
 the way you behaved
 toward my girl either.

1295
01:00:46,410 --> 01:00:50,612
 I want you to leave quietly
 and never see my wife again.
 Or my children.

1296
01:00:50,648 --> 01:00:52,214
          Well, wait a minute,
          buster.

1297
01:00:52,249 --> 01:00:54,116
 If I hear that
 you've been bothering
 Stephanie again,

1298
01:00:54,151 --> 01:00:56,718
 I'll knock
 all your teeth out.

1299
01:00:56,754 --> 01:00:58,920
       You'll have to put them
       back in again.

1300
01:00:59,456 --> 01:01:00,489
        Get out!

1301
01:01:04,762 --> 01:01:06,628
 I guess that'll
 take care of him.

1302
01:01:06,664 --> 01:01:11,099
      You know, Julian,
      I've never seen you being
      so physical before.

1303
01:01:11,135 --> 01:01:12,768
        And you were beautiful.

1304
01:01:12,803 --> 01:01:15,337
 Ah, it was nothing.

1305
01:01:15,372 --> 01:01:18,674
 What do you say
 we go over to your place
 where we can be alone?

1306
01:01:18,709 --> 01:01:20,242
                 I'd like that.

1307
01:01:21,945 --> 01:01:25,380
     Well, I am a little tired,
     so I think I'll go home.
     If you'll excuse me.

1308
01:01:25,416 --> 01:01:27,916
 You're going home alone?
 Without an escort?

1309
01:01:27,951 --> 01:01:32,187
     Oh, I'm used to that.
     Thank you. Good night.

1310
01:01:32,222 --> 01:01:33,321
                    Good night.

1311
01:01:33,357 --> 01:01:34,690
          Mrs. Winston.

1312
01:01:34,725 --> 01:01:38,260
      Wait. Uh, Julian
      can drop me off
      and then drive you home.

1313
01:01:38,295 --> 01:01:39,928
 No, no,
 I couldn't do that.

1314
01:01:39,963 --> 01:01:42,464
       Oh, he'd be glad to.
       Won't you, dear?

1315
01:01:42,499 --> 01:01:43,665
        It's all settled.

1316
01:01:44,635 --> 01:01:45,967
   Thank you, Toni.

1317
01:01:46,003 --> 01:01:49,104
 It's been so long
 since Julian and I
 have gone home together.

1318
01:01:49,873 --> 01:01:52,340
                You're a great
                little fixer.

1319
01:01:52,376 --> 01:01:54,876
    I'll dump her
    in Jackson Heights and then
    come back to your place.

1320
01:01:54,912 --> 01:01:57,312
 No, Julian, not tonight.
 Stay with her.

1321
01:01:57,347 --> 01:01:59,781
      Are you out of your mind?
      What the hell am I
      going to do with her?

1322
01:01:59,817 --> 01:02:01,416
 You're gonna be
 very nice.

1323
01:02:01,452 --> 01:02:02,551
          Now, wait a minute...

1324
01:02:02,586 --> 01:02:04,286
 Very nice, to please me.

1325
01:02:08,459 --> 01:02:09,991
 Well, Doctor,
 I know how anxious
 you are

1326
01:02:10,027 --> 01:02:12,561
 to dump me and get back
 to Toni, so you...

1327
01:02:12,596 --> 01:02:13,829
      I'm not going back there.

1328
01:02:13,864 --> 01:02:15,130
 You're not going back?
                          No.

1329
01:02:15,165 --> 01:02:16,998
              Toni thought
              you looked so sad
              and humiliated,

1330
01:02:17,034 --> 01:02:18,533
              she told me
              to stay with you.

1331
01:02:18,569 --> 01:02:19,968
 Stay with me?

1332
01:02:20,003 --> 01:02:21,837
 Now, let us get
 our stories straight.

1333
01:02:21,872 --> 01:02:25,407
 As far as Toni is concerned,
 are we supposed to have
 spent the night together?

1334
01:02:25,442 --> 01:02:27,275
           No, of course not.
           I've thought
           the whole thing over

1335
01:02:27,311 --> 01:02:28,810
             and I've decided
             to tell the truth.

1336
01:02:28,846 --> 01:02:30,345
     Good for you.

1337
01:02:30,380 --> 01:02:31,680
           I'll buy her a nice,
           expensive present
           and tell the truth,

1338
01:02:31,715 --> 01:02:33,081
              then she and I
              can get married.

1339
01:02:33,117 --> 01:02:35,183
 Then everything is fine.
                  No, it isn't.

1340
01:02:35,219 --> 01:02:36,818
      'cause when she finds out
      that I've been lying,

1341
01:02:36,854 --> 01:02:39,321
           she's liable to do
           something desperate.
           It's all your fault.

1342
01:02:39,356 --> 01:02:42,657
    You did all you could
    to louse me up.
    Harvey was trying his best.

1343
01:02:42,693 --> 01:02:45,427
        You didn't have to
        put on that act
        about being humiliated.

1344
01:02:45,462 --> 01:02:47,129
 That was no act.
 I was humiliated.

1345
01:02:47,164 --> 01:02:49,197
              Miss Dickinson,
              you have this
              hang-up about men

1346
01:02:49,233 --> 01:02:52,033
     that forces you to destroy
     any possible relationship.

1347
01:02:52,069 --> 01:02:53,869
        That's really what
        causes you hate Harvey.

1348
01:02:53,904 --> 01:02:55,504
 No one needs a reason
 for hating Harvey.

1349
01:02:55,539 --> 01:02:57,606
          You completely
          de-feminize yourself.

1350
01:02:57,641 --> 01:02:59,808
              I've noticed it
              around the office
              and around me.

1351
01:02:59,843 --> 01:03:03,311
 Now, Doctor, I was hired
 as a nurse-receptionist,
 not as a geisha girl.

1352
01:03:03,347 --> 01:03:05,380
             You're afraid,
             Miss Dickinson.
             Afraid of emotion,

1353
01:03:05,415 --> 01:03:07,783
            afraid of intimacy,
            afraid to live.

1354
01:03:07,818 --> 01:03:11,086
 If you call that living,
 the way you carry on,
 Doctor, then you're right.

      for your own good.

 Funny how, whenever
 people hurt your feelings,

       for a moment, please?

1413
01:06:00,991 --> 01:06:02,691
             Yes, Mr. Shirley.

1414
01:06:02,726 --> 01:06:04,626
          May I ask
          what's going on here?

1415
01:06:04,661 --> 01:06:07,662
 Um, this gentleman
 is looking for a, a stereo

1416
01:06:07,698 --> 01:06:11,633
  to match the color
  of his wife's mink.

1417
01:06:11,668 --> 01:06:14,736
     When I think how many nuts
     are running around loose
     in this town...

1418
01:06:14,771 --> 01:06:16,237
                   Carry on.

1419
01:06:17,641 --> 01:06:21,176
             Now, go ahead.
             You were saying
             Stephanie is...

1420
01:06:21,211 --> 01:06:24,279
 Yes, you see,
 Stephanie, uh, is...

1421
01:06:25,415 --> 01:06:27,983
           Oh, come on, Julian,
           let's have it.
           You know me.

1422
01:06:28,018 --> 01:06:30,785
            I can forgive
            anything but a lie.

1423
01:06:30,821 --> 01:06:32,120
       Forget it.

1424
01:06:32,155 --> 01:06:34,656
         Let me try to help.
         You have a problem
         with Stephanie, right?

1425
01:06:34,691 --> 01:06:37,525
     Never mind.
         Let's see, she drinks?

1426
01:06:37,861 --> 01:06:38,994
         No.

1427
01:06:39,029 --> 01:06:40,895
          She's a kleptomaniac?
          No.

1428
01:06:40,931 --> 01:06:42,831
            Uh, she takes acid?

1429
01:06:43,533 --> 01:06:44,366

1430
01:06:44,401 --> 01:06:45,734
                There's only
                one other thing

1431
01:06:45,769 --> 01:06:48,336
             I know a man would
             really be ashamed
             to talk about.

1432
01:06:48,372 --> 01:06:50,772
               Stephanie is
               no nymphomaniac.

1433
01:06:52,009 --> 01:06:53,441
                 I guessed it?

1434
01:06:53,477 --> 01:06:55,643
          That's what you
          came here to tell me?

1435
01:06:55,912 --> 01:06:58,146
                        Wow.

1436
01:06:58,181 --> 01:06:59,881
 Well, go ahead,
 give me all the details.

1437
01:06:59,916 --> 01:07:03,451
     What can I tell you,
     except my wife, Stephanie,
     is a slave to her desires?

1438
01:07:03,487 --> 01:07:05,720
           Well, that's a very
           sweet way of
           describing a nympho.

1439
01:07:05,756 --> 01:07:07,589
     You can imagine
     what my life
     has been like.

1440
01:07:07,624 --> 01:07:10,458
  Julian, you've got
  to take the children
  away from her immediately.

1441
01:07:10,494 --> 01:07:13,228
 Why? It's not catching.

1442
01:07:13,263 --> 01:07:15,163
      You, you, you've got
      to fight her for custody.

1443
01:07:15,198 --> 01:07:16,631
                   You have...
         Shh!

1444
01:07:17,934 --> 01:07:20,835
        Come to think of it,
        the children don't look
        much like you.

1445
01:07:20,871 --> 01:07:22,904
     The whole thing
     is too painful
     to talk about.

1446
01:07:22,939 --> 01:07:26,441
          Oh, you poor darling.
          When I think of
          that awful woman.

1447
01:07:26,476 --> 01:07:28,376
              What am I saying?
              She's not awful.

1448
01:07:28,412 --> 01:07:30,845
       I mean, she's marvelous.
       I admire her courage.

1449
01:07:30,881 --> 01:07:34,649
 Well, now that
 the whole ugly story
 is out,

1450
01:07:34,684 --> 01:07:37,218
 we'll never mention
 her name again.

1451
01:07:39,489 --> 01:07:40,889
 You know what I was doing
 when you arrived?

1452
01:07:40,924 --> 01:07:43,324
 Sending a present
 to Stephanie.
 She likes Horowitz.

1453
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:44,893
            What's her address
            in Jackson Heights?

1454
01:07:44,928 --> 01:07:46,394
 Why don't you just
 send it to the office?

1455
01:07:46,430 --> 01:07:48,797
     Miss Dickinson
     will forward it.

1456
01:07:48,832 --> 01:07:49,864
  Hi.

1457
01:07:49,900 --> 01:07:52,033
      What do you mean by that?
      I'll see you later.

1458
01:07:53,403 --> 01:07:54,936
 This time I was dressed.

1459
01:07:54,971 --> 01:07:56,371
      (TELEPHONE RINGING)

1460
01:07:57,374 --> 01:07:59,140
 What have you got there?

1461
01:07:59,176 --> 01:08:01,342
                Oh, it's mink.
                From Julian.

1462
01:08:02,345 --> 01:08:04,646
 My Aunt Bertha
 has one just like it.

1463
01:08:04,681 --> 01:08:08,216
         Yeah, I know. I wanted
         black leather slacks.

1464
01:08:08,251 --> 01:08:10,385
        Poor Julian. He thought
        this would please me.

1465
01:08:10,420 --> 01:08:11,953
   It's a throwback
   to the days

1466
01:08:11,988 --> 01:08:14,222
 when, when a hunter
 would give his wife
 the dead animal skins.

1467
01:08:14,257 --> 01:08:16,491
 Wonder how many minks
 Julian has killed?

1468
01:08:16,526 --> 01:08:18,827
      That's very unkind, Igor.

1469
01:08:18,862 --> 01:08:22,163
        When I think of
        all the women who would
        do anything for this

1470
01:08:22,199 --> 01:08:24,299
         and here I am,
         not really wanting it.

1471
01:08:24,334 --> 01:08:27,335
   Hey, Igor, this is my chance
   to do a good deed.

1472
01:08:27,370 --> 01:08:29,304
       I was going to send
       his wife those records.

1473
01:08:29,339 --> 01:08:31,005
          I'll send her
          this mink instead.

1474
01:08:31,041 --> 01:08:32,207
   Oh, boy.

1475
01:08:32,242 --> 01:08:33,675
             What's wrong?
             She'll love it.

1476
01:08:33,710 --> 01:08:36,778
 Mrs. Winston
 will never accept
 a mink stole from you.

1477
01:08:36,813 --> 01:08:38,480
             Where's that card?

1478
01:08:39,883 --> 01:08:41,683
       "As ever, Julian."

1479
01:08:42,219 --> 01:08:43,585
       That should do it.

1480
01:08:43,620 --> 01:08:46,754
       Anyway, it's just sort
       of a care package.

1481

      But a nice kook.

 Oh, Señor Sanchez,
 but you're
 10 minutes early.

1483
01:08:54,664 --> 01:08:57,532
        Imagine, Arturo Sanchez
        being early
        for the dentist.

1484
01:08:57,567 --> 01:08:59,367
           It is a new man, no?
      Certainly is.

1485
01:08:59,402 --> 01:09:01,102
         And today,
         I hurried to get here.

1486
01:09:01,138 --> 01:09:02,203
               Do you know why?

                     Yes.

1488
01:09:03,807 --> 01:09:05,340
              The cowardly fear
              of the dentist,

1489
01:09:05,375 --> 01:09:07,308
         is completely overcome
         by the great desire

01:09:07,344 --> 01:09:09,444
             to see the lovely,
             delicious
             Miss Dickinson.

1491
01:09:09,479 --> 01:09:11,179

 that you're here.

1493

          Tell me,
          have you ever been
          to a diplomatic ball?

1494
01:09:16,186 --> 01:09:17,752
 Me? It's a little
 out of my line.

1495
01:09:17,787 --> 01:09:20,021
             Tonight there will
             be such a function
             at the Waldorf.

1496

         It will be very boring

1497
01:09:21,324 --> 01:09:23,525
 unless you do me the honors
 of accompanying me.

1498
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:24,626
          What about your wife?

1499
01:09:24,661 --> 01:09:26,694
 Must we take my wife
 everywhere?

1500

 Besides, she's spending
 a week at a fat farm.

1501

      Thank you, Señor Sanchez,
      but I rarely go out
      on weekdays,

1502
01:09:31,768 --> 01:09:33,334
         and I don't have
         the kind of clothes...

            It's nice
            of you to ask me,
            but I'm afraid not.

1506

          But, I must warn you,
          the men in my family

01:11:53,443 --> 01:11:56,244
       I wanted to get you
       something that
       I thought you'd like.

1535
01:11:56,279 --> 01:11:58,746
   After all, you've put up
   with a lot from me lately.

1536
01:11:58,782 --> 01:12:00,581
 I never dreamed
 I'd, I...

1537
01:12:00,617 --> 01:12:02,917
 I never expected
 anything like this.

1538
01:12:02,952 --> 01:12:05,787
    Oh, it's... It's all right,
    if you like Horowitz.

1539
01:12:07,991 --> 01:12:10,858
       Horowitz? Must be
       the name of the furrier.

1540
01:12:11,328 --> 01:12:13,027
            Oh. Ah.

1541
01:12:21,404 --> 01:12:24,205
 Miss Dickinson, these are
 Harvey Greenfield's x-rays.

1542
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:26,207
          I'm so sorry, Doctor.

1543
01:12:27,877 --> 01:12:29,544
       (STAMMERING)

1544
01:12:48,098 --> 01:12:50,064
            What is it, Doctor?

1545
01:12:50,100 --> 01:12:53,201
           Is there something
           wrong with my x-ray?

1546
01:12:53,236 --> 01:12:55,103
              You know
              how nervous I am.

1547
01:12:55,138 --> 01:12:59,073
       Hello, Anna.
       I want you to run over
       to Lucille's dress shop.

1548
01:12:59,109 --> 01:13:02,143
   There's an evening dress
   I was looking at.
   I want you to buy it for me.

1549
01:13:02,178 --> 01:13:04,879
           I need it tonight.
           I'm going to a ball.

1550
01:13:04,914 --> 01:13:07,782
             Doctor, you can
             tell me the truth.

1551
01:13:07,817 --> 01:13:10,351
          Um, it is an abscess?

1552
01:13:10,387 --> 01:13:12,153
        The, the nerve is dead?

1553
01:13:13,823 --> 01:13:16,157
       All my teeth have to go?

1554
01:13:16,192 --> 01:13:18,659
            Doctor, talk to me,
            please!

1555
01:13:19,896 --> 01:13:21,696
 What is she?
 Your dearest friend?

1556
01:13:21,731 --> 01:13:24,465
 Do you realize
 how much I paid
 for that mink?

1557
01:13:24,501 --> 01:13:27,235
           Oh boy, you're never
           going to stop
           nagging me about it.

1558
01:13:27,270 --> 01:13:29,237
      You're beginning to sound
      just like a husband.

1559
01:13:29,272 --> 01:13:30,605
        (KNOCKING ON DOOR)

1560
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:32,607
              A square husband.

1561
01:13:34,177 --> 01:13:36,210
        Hi. You said you wanted
        to read my play.

1562
01:13:36,246 --> 01:13:37,912
           Thanks, Igor.

1563
01:13:37,947 --> 01:13:40,281
    Hey, what are you doing
    for dinner tonight?

1564
01:13:40,316 --> 01:13:42,450
          It depends.
          What have you got
          in your refrigerator?

1565
01:13:42,485 --> 01:13:44,752
   We're going out for dinner.
   You want to come with us?

1566
01:13:44,788 --> 01:13:47,288
 I'm sure Igor
 would be very bored.

1567
01:13:47,323 --> 01:13:50,091
          No. Not if
          you're paying for it.
          I'll put on a tie.

1568
01:13:50,126 --> 01:13:53,127
 Why? Are you having
 your beads re-strung?

1569
01:13:55,999 --> 01:13:58,866
         I thought we were
         going to have
         a quiet little dinner?

1570
01:13:58,902 --> 01:14:00,768
       Well, Igor's
       very depressed.

1571
01:14:00,804 --> 01:14:03,104
          There's a lot of that
          going around now.

1572
01:14:03,139 --> 01:14:06,941
        (MUSIC PLAYING)

1573
01:14:29,566 --> 01:14:31,165
 Why'd we come back here?

1574
01:14:31,201 --> 01:14:33,935
           It's the one place
           we won't bump
           into Dr. Winston.

1575
01:14:33,970 --> 01:14:36,204
      Why don't you want
      to bump into Dr. Winston?

1576
01:14:36,239 --> 01:14:38,940
 Let me put it to you
 this way, shut up.

1577
01:14:50,987 --> 01:14:52,520
      Hello, Harvey.
      How are you?

1578
01:14:52,555 --> 01:14:54,956
           How am I?
           I'm sore as hell,
           that's how I am.

1579
01:14:54,991 --> 01:14:56,591
 I don't blame you,
 Harvey, but listen...

1580
01:14:56,626 --> 01:14:59,727
         You treated me like
         I was dirt and
         you were Mr. Clean.

1581
01:14:59,762 --> 01:15:01,562
 Look, I'm having
 a rough time.

1582
01:15:01,598 --> 01:15:04,332
 As long as I was
 lying to her,
 everything was fine.

1583
01:15:04,367 --> 01:15:05,233
 But the minute
 I decided

1584
01:15:05,268 --> 01:15:06,834
 to do the right thing
 and marry her,

1585
01:15:06,870 --> 01:15:08,102
 I've had nothing
 but troubles.

1586
01:15:08,137 --> 01:15:10,438
 You wouldn't believe
 the complications.

1587
01:15:10,473 --> 01:15:12,406
 It's like waltzing
 in wet cement.

1588
01:15:12,442 --> 01:15:15,943
 I haven't even been able
 to spend one night
 alone with her.

1589
01:15:19,215 --> 01:15:22,316
 I'd better get back, Harvey,
 before she sees us together.

1590
01:15:28,725 --> 01:15:33,528
       If you work for the CIA,
       how come you hang around
       with dentists?

1591
01:15:33,563 --> 01:15:37,798
 He's installing a miniature
 radio transmitter
 in my wisdom tooth.

1592
01:15:39,769 --> 01:15:42,270
      What were you
      doing talking to
      that awful man?

1593
01:15:42,305 --> 01:15:44,906
         I was getting lonesome
         for the sound
         of a human voice.

1594
01:15:44,941 --> 01:15:47,808
 Can I have another
 glass of beer?
                   Not yours.

1595
01:15:47,844 --> 01:15:50,044
          Why did we have
          to come here tonight?

1596
01:15:50,079 --> 01:15:51,612
        Well, after what
        happened last time,

1597
01:15:51,648 --> 01:15:55,182
       it's the one place
       we're sure not to
       run into your wife.

1598
01:15:55,218 --> 01:15:59,020
 This is very interesting.
 What made you suggest this?

1599
01:15:59,055 --> 01:16:02,423
           It's the one place
           we're sure not to
           run into my boss.

1600
01:16:04,027 --> 01:16:07,061
        Oh, thank you, Arturo.
        The ball was marvelous.

1601
01:16:07,096 --> 01:16:09,864
 Oh, no, no, no.
 You were marvelous.

1602
01:16:09,899 --> 01:16:11,065
 What shall we drink?

1603
01:16:11,100 --> 01:16:13,501
        Let's have some of that
        crazy Idaho champagne.

1604
01:16:14,304 --> 01:16:16,237
         Hey. Look at that!

1605
01:16:17,907 --> 01:16:20,274
        I can hardly believe
        that's Stephanie.

1606
01:16:21,444 --> 01:16:23,611
          It is.
          I recognize the mink.

1607
01:16:23,646 --> 01:16:27,615
 Oh, that gown is absolute
 poetry. Everybody at the ball
 was staring at it.

1608
01:16:27,650 --> 01:16:29,283
                   It's a copy
                   of a copy.

1609
01:16:29,319 --> 01:16:32,053
 Oh, but a girl like you
 should have
 nothing but originals.

1610
01:16:32,088 --> 01:16:34,388
 In a Swiss bank,
 I have $20 million...

1611
01:16:34,424 --> 01:16:37,158
    Well. Didn't take her long
    to find somebody else.

1612
01:16:37,193 --> 01:16:38,392
 Toni, do you want to
 let me in on this?

1613
01:16:38,428 --> 01:16:41,062
 Who's that woman?
          Julian's wife.

1614
01:16:41,097 --> 01:16:44,532
 Not bad, Julian.
 As a matter of fact,
 she's very attractive.

1615
01:16:44,567 --> 01:16:46,000
                    Thank you.

1616
01:16:46,035 --> 01:16:48,469
     Say, Igor, I didn't
     know you went
     for the older ones.

1617
01:16:48,504 --> 01:16:50,171
 Look who's talking.

1618
01:16:50,206 --> 01:16:51,339
          (INAUDIBLE)

 (LAUGHING)

1620
01:16:53,710 --> 01:16:55,443
 There's Dr. Winston.
                    Where?

1621
01:16:55,478 --> 01:16:56,944
                    Oh, dear.
                    (SIGHS)

1622
01:16:56,980 --> 01:16:59,046
        It seems I just can't
        get away from that man.

1623
01:16:59,082 --> 01:17:01,616
 Would you like to leave?
              No, no, no,
              let's ignore him.

1624
01:17:01,651 --> 01:17:03,017
         After all, my evenings
         are my own.

1625
01:17:03,052 --> 01:17:04,619
 What about your weekends?

1626
01:17:04,654 --> 01:17:06,020
                 They belong
                 to my nephews.

1627
01:17:06,055 --> 01:17:07,555
   Oh, I see.

1628
01:17:07,590 --> 01:17:10,625
         <i> El Bravo,</i> you're not
          going to give up
          that easily, are you?

1629
01:17:10,660 --> 01:17:12,360
 Of course not.

1630
01:17:12,395 --> 01:17:14,962
 Did I tell you the time
 I played a whole game
 of polo with a broken leg?

1631
01:17:14,998 --> 01:17:16,831
          No, tell me about it.

1632
01:17:18,134 --> 01:17:21,202
      Hey, isn't that the woman
      from the other night?

1633
01:17:21,237 --> 01:17:23,304
  Yeah, I do believe
  you're right.

1634
01:17:23,339 --> 01:17:24,672
                  Who is she?

1635
01:17:24,707 --> 01:17:26,741
   That's the dentist's,
   uh, wife.

1636
01:17:26,776 --> 01:17:28,676
              Well, who's that
              with the dentist?

1637
01:17:28,711 --> 01:17:30,544
 That's his fiancee.

1638
01:17:30,580 --> 01:17:32,913
                 He has a wife
                 and a fiancee?

1639
01:17:32,949 --> 01:17:35,683
 Well, it's better
 than having two wives.

1640
01:17:35,718 --> 01:17:37,718
             Then who's the man
             with Mrs. Winston?

1641
01:17:37,754 --> 01:17:39,220
   Her new boyfriend.

1642
01:17:39,255 --> 01:17:41,822
               Who's the guy
               with Dr. Winston
               and his girl?

1643
01:17:41,858 --> 01:17:43,758
     That must be
     her boyfriend.

1644
01:17:43,793 --> 01:17:46,227
             I think the whole
             thing is shocking.

1645
01:17:48,531 --> 01:17:49,997
      Shall we?

1646
01:17:52,435 --> 01:17:53,868
   (LAUGHS)

1647
01:18:06,015 --> 01:18:07,615
                   Look at them
                   dancing.

1648
01:18:07,650 --> 01:18:10,051
 You're not jealous,
 are you?

1649
01:18:10,086 --> 01:18:12,987
        She shouldn't leave
        her mink
        lying around like that.

1650
01:18:13,022 --> 01:18:14,455
         Someone might take it.

1651
01:18:14,490 --> 01:18:15,790
         It's her mink now.

1652
01:18:15,825 --> 01:18:17,425
          Come on, let's dance.

1653
01:18:21,898 --> 01:18:22,997
    Mrs. Winston!

1654
01:18:23,032 --> 01:18:24,799
             Oh!
             Here we are again.

1655
01:18:24,834 --> 01:18:26,500
       Good evening, Doctor.

1656
01:18:26,536 --> 01:18:28,202
 Good evening,
 patient.

1657
01:18:29,439 --> 01:18:32,807
 Well, you're certainly
 blossoming out.

01:18:32,842 --> 01:18:35,576
            Doctor, you once
            compared me
            to my cactus plant.

1659
01:18:35,611 --> 01:18:38,045
      Well, every so often,
      that prickly little thing

1660
01:18:38,081 --> 01:18:40,247
      puts out a flower
      that some people think...

1661
01:18:40,283 --> 01:18:41,982
 Miss Dickinson,
 I strongly disapprove

1662
01:18:42,018 --> 01:18:43,684
     of you making dates
     with patients.

1663
01:18:43,720 --> 01:18:46,620
          Really? Then how come
          you fixed me up
          with Harvey?

1664
01:18:54,731 --> 01:18:57,031
 Look at them
 acting so damn polite.

1665
01:18:57,066 --> 01:18:58,632
    They're all
    rotten, rotten.

1666
01:18:58,668 --> 01:19:00,935
   What do you want them to do,
   start kicking each other?

1667
01:19:00,970 --> 01:19:02,236
  Rotten, rotten.

1668
01:19:03,506 --> 01:19:06,140
         No, Julian,
         like this.

1669
01:19:06,175 --> 01:19:08,909
           That looks like fun.
           Let us try it.

1670
01:19:16,319 --> 01:19:18,385
 That's it, Stephanie.
               Oh!

1671
01:19:21,524 --> 01:19:23,090
            I've got it, huh?

1672
01:19:23,960 --> 01:19:25,493
                  Hi, Sergeant.

             Hi, Harv.

 Boy, you're terrific.

 this is Igor Sullivan.

 That's not his real
 name, of course.

01:20:57,119 --> 01:20:59,220
               I should have
               brought my wife.

         with your mother.

        that Igor of yours is
        a pretty vulgar dancer.

1705
01:21:25,748 --> 01:21:29,516
 What do you mean, Igor?
 She's the one plastering
 herself against him.

 I've done for her.

1708
01:21:39,195 --> 01:21:41,262
             He just kissed her
             on the neck.

1709
01:21:41,297 --> 01:21:43,297
 Phoo! She sure likes
 a lot of action.

1710
01:21:43,332 --> 01:21:45,165
                Yes, she does,
                doesn't she?

1711
01:21:45,201 --> 01:21:48,135
 Right now she's surrounded
 by her husband,

 her ex-boyfriend,
 her current boyfriend,

 her future boyfriend.

        leave her alone
        when she's like this.

 to go home.

01:26:50,005 --> 01:26:51,872
      No, I didn't get it.

1790
01:26:51,907 --> 01:26:53,907
   Well, first I, I went to
   the police station,

1791
01:26:53,943 --> 01:26:57,611
       and they told me
       to try this garage
       on the East Side.

1792
01:26:57,646 --> 01:27:00,914
    When I got there
    they told me to try the
    garage on the West Side.

1793
01:27:00,950 --> 01:27:02,783
     And when I got there,
     it was closed.

1794
01:27:02,818 --> 01:27:05,819
     I couldn't find a cab
     so I had to walk home.

1795
01:27:05,854 --> 01:27:08,622
      I should have listened
      to my mother
      and become an MD.

1796
01:27:08,657 --> 01:27:11,425
         Then they let you
         park anywhere.

1797
01:27:11,460 --> 01:27:14,795
   Yeah, okay.
   You go back to bed.
   I'll see you tonight. Right.

1798
01:27:16,332 --> 01:27:17,631
 Did she get home
 all right?

1799
01:27:17,666 --> 01:27:19,533
        Yes, which is more
        than I can say for you.

1800
01:27:19,568 --> 01:27:22,035
       My cactus.
       It's blooming!

1801
01:27:22,071 --> 01:27:24,571
          Never mind, now.
          What about your night
          of debauchery

1802
01:27:24,607 --> 01:27:25,939
            with Señor Sanchez?

1803
01:27:25,975 --> 01:27:28,075
 Señor Sanchez?
 Whoever said anything
 about him?

1804
01:27:28,110 --> 01:27:30,444
 We lost him
 early in the evening.
              We? Who's we?

1805
01:27:30,479 --> 01:27:31,678
        Igor and I.

1806
01:27:31,714 --> 01:27:33,614
            You mean,
            you spent the night
            with that hippie?

1807
01:27:33,649 --> 01:27:37,684
 But you're wrong about Igor.
 He's sensitive
 and sincere and very poetic.

1808
01:27:37,720 --> 01:27:40,420
          Poetic? I saw him
          kiss you on the neck.

1809
01:27:40,456 --> 01:27:41,855
 He's also very friendly.

1810
01:27:41,890 --> 01:27:43,790
          There's no such thing
          as a friendly kiss
          on the neck.

1811
01:27:43,826 --> 01:27:47,928
 I must say it's grotesque,
 a woman your age throwing
 yourself at a kid like that.

1812
01:27:47,963 --> 01:27:50,397
            What about that
            father-and-daughter
            thing of yours?

1813
01:27:50,432 --> 01:27:52,165
       If you don't think
       that looks ridiculous...

1814
01:27:52,201 --> 01:27:55,569
 It's different with a man.
 A man with a younger woman
 looks appropriate.

1815
01:27:55,604 --> 01:27:57,004
 But when it's
 the other way around...

1816
01:27:57,039 --> 01:27:59,106
          You go to your church
          and I'll go to mine.

1817
01:27:59,141 --> 01:28:01,642
          It wasn't easy for me
          to do what I did
          last night.

1818
01:28:01,677 --> 01:28:03,644
           But every time
           I felt shaky,
           I thought about you.

1819
01:28:03,679 --> 01:28:05,279
 Oh, yes. It was obvious
 you were thinking of me.

1820
01:28:05,314 --> 01:28:07,881
          Thinking about all
          those terrible things
          you said to me.

1821
01:28:07,916 --> 01:28:10,317
         I was determined
         to make up
         for the time I'd lost.

1822
01:28:10,352 --> 01:28:11,852
           And I intend
           to keep on doing it.

1823
01:28:11,887 --> 01:28:13,220
             And now, if you'll
             excuse me,

1824
01:28:13,255 --> 01:28:15,055
              I'm going to take
              an Alka-Seltzer.

1825
01:28:19,328 --> 01:28:22,029
 I don't mind saying
 I'm disappointed in you,
 Miss Dickinson.

1826
01:28:22,064 --> 01:28:23,297
 Very disappointed.

1827
01:28:23,332 --> 01:28:27,200
         Doctor, you're the one
         who said I was
         discouraging men.

1828
01:28:27,236 --> 01:28:28,769
        Stifling my femininity.

1829
01:28:28,804 --> 01:28:30,103
        But the first time
        an attractive young man

1830
01:28:30,139 --> 01:28:32,639
       pays a little attention
       to me, you go to pieces.

1831
01:28:32,675 --> 01:28:34,341
              Well, if I didn't
              know you so well,

1832
01:28:34,376 --> 01:28:35,876
               I'd almost swear
               you're jealous.

1833
01:28:35,911 --> 01:28:38,779
   Jealous? Of you?
   Come now,
   Miss Dickinson.

1834
01:28:38,814 --> 01:28:40,547
 I just think
 it's in very bad taste

1835
01:28:40,582 --> 01:28:42,916
 when, under my eyes
 and the eyes
 of my fiancee,

1836
01:28:42,951 --> 01:28:46,320
 my wife puts on
 an indecent,
 immoral exhibition,

1837
01:28:46,355 --> 01:28:48,655
   with someone young
   enough to be her son.

1838
01:28:52,194 --> 01:28:53,293
               All right, look.

1839
01:28:53,329 --> 01:28:55,195
            So you had a little
            fling last night.

1840
01:28:55,230 --> 01:28:58,865
       Nobody's knocking it.
       After all, there was
       no harm done. Was there?

1841
01:28:58,901 --> 01:29:01,501
 Why don't you come right out
 and ask me
 if I went to bed with him?

1842
01:29:01,537 --> 01:29:03,370
            All right.
            Did you go to bed
            with him?

1843
01:29:03,405 --> 01:29:04,738
  It's none
  of your business.

1844
01:29:04,773 --> 01:29:06,640
        What happened out there
        on my mink stole?

1845
01:29:06,675 --> 01:29:08,575
            I mean, the beach?
            I want to know.

1846
01:29:09,211 --> 01:29:10,844
 By what right?

1847
01:29:10,879 --> 01:29:12,746
     A husband's right.
     Let me remind you
     that you're still my wife!

1848
01:29:12,781 --> 01:29:14,848
    No more!
    I want a divorce!

1849
01:29:14,883 --> 01:29:16,850
       After all the years
       of misery I've had.

1850
01:29:16,885 --> 01:29:18,585
               Years of misery?

1851
01:29:18,620 --> 01:29:20,620
       Yes, all those mornings
       when I went in

1852
01:29:20,656 --> 01:29:21,988
            and found hairpins
            on the couch

1853
01:29:22,024 --> 01:29:25,125
          and lipstick
          on mouthwash glasses.

1854
01:29:25,160 --> 01:29:26,526
   You've been spying on me?

1855
01:29:26,562 --> 01:29:28,128
      All right,
      you want to play rough,

1856
01:29:28,163 --> 01:29:31,365
      I'll tell the world
      about your drunkenness,
      your wild parties,

1857
01:29:31,400 --> 01:29:32,733
 your orgies
 on the beach!

1858
01:29:32,768 --> 01:29:35,168
  You want a divorce?
  It's I who wants a divorce.

1859
01:29:35,204 --> 01:29:37,437
        I'll call the Registry
        and have them
        send you another nurse.

1860
01:29:37,473 --> 01:29:40,240
         And here, give this to
         your child-concubine.

1861
01:29:40,275 --> 01:29:41,575
 Stephanie,
 if you walk out now,

1862
01:29:41,610 --> 01:29:42,943
 don't bother
 to come back!

1863
01:29:42,978 --> 01:29:44,911
        Don't worry,
        Doctor Winston,
        you won't see me again.

1864
01:29:44,947 --> 01:29:47,214
         And that goes
         for the children, too!

1865
01:29:50,018 --> 01:29:51,485
 How late were you
 out with her?

1866
01:29:51,520 --> 01:29:54,121
        I thought you came here
        to talk about my play?

1867
01:29:54,156 --> 01:29:56,957
   Well, I'll wait
   till they make it
   into a movie.

1868
01:29:58,961 --> 01:30:01,828
       I have a right to know
       what went on.
       She's my fiancee's wife.

1869
01:30:01,864 --> 01:30:03,463
 Toni, I'd rather not
 discuss the lady.

1870
01:30:03,499 --> 01:30:06,967
         Well, I happen to know
         this particular lady
         swings with anybody.

1871
01:30:07,002 --> 01:30:08,735
   Well, then I guess
   I'm not anybody.

1872
01:30:08,771 --> 01:30:11,304
             You mean, nothing?

1873
01:30:11,340 --> 01:30:13,173
       She didn't want to, huh?

1874
01:30:13,208 --> 01:30:14,508
 Maybe I didn't want to.

1875
01:30:14,543 --> 01:30:16,276
              Oh, I doubt that.

1876
01:30:16,311 --> 01:30:18,412
            I saw the way
            you kissed her neck
            like Dracula.

1877
01:30:18,447 --> 01:30:21,815
 All we did was dance a lot,
 drink a lot, talk a lot.

1878
01:30:22,351 --> 01:30:23,417
                    About what?

1879
01:30:23,452 --> 01:30:24,851
    About my work,
    about myself.

1880
01:30:24,887 --> 01:30:27,888
 It isn't often
 I find a woman
 I, I enjoy talking to.

1881
01:30:27,923 --> 01:30:30,023
          Are you implying
          you can't talk to me?

1882
01:30:30,058 --> 01:30:32,292
 Come to think of it,
 I cannot. You're always
 doing the talking,

1883
01:30:32,327 --> 01:30:35,095
 and it's always
 about your troubles
 with that tooth jockey.

1884
01:30:35,130 --> 01:30:38,532
           Julian is a fine man
           and much too good
           for his wife.

1885
01:30:38,567 --> 01:30:40,000
             You ought to know
             what I know.

1886
01:30:40,035 --> 01:30:42,302
      Well, I know what I know.
      She's a hell of a dame.

1887
01:30:42,337 --> 01:30:44,838
     (STAMMERING)
     She's good-looking, smart,
     warm, very appealing.

1888
01:30:44,873 --> 01:30:46,339
 Aha, then you
 did want to!

1889
01:30:46,375 --> 01:30:48,675
            Oh, for God's sake,
            Toni, why don't
            you act your age?

1890
01:30:48,710 --> 01:30:50,277
            Or rather,
            don't act your age.

1891
01:30:50,312 --> 01:30:51,945
        (KNOCKING ON DOOR)

1892
01:30:54,550 --> 01:30:56,483
                 Hey, Dracula,
                 it's for you.

1893
01:30:56,518 --> 01:30:57,751
   Toni, I want to
   talk to you.

1894
01:30:57,786 --> 01:30:59,252
            Hi. How's your head
            today?

1895
01:30:59,288 --> 01:31:00,620
   Which one?

1896
01:31:00,656 --> 01:31:02,556
 Igor, do you, do you
 mind if I talk to...

1897
01:31:02,591 --> 01:31:04,090
             Oh, of course not.

1898
01:31:04,126 --> 01:31:05,425
         Wait a minute,
         I live here.

1899
01:31:05,461 --> 01:31:06,993
                   You can wait
                   in my place.

1900

1901
01:31:11,800 --> 01:31:13,967
             And I used to
             worry about you.

1902
01:31:14,002 --> 01:31:15,702
 That's what caused
 all the trouble.

1903
01:31:15,737 --> 01:31:17,671
             Boy, you and Igor,
             that child...

1904
01:31:17,706 --> 01:31:18,972
 I didn't come
 to talk about Igor.

1905
01:31:19,007 --> 01:31:20,607
 I want to talk
 about Julian and me.

1906
01:31:20,642 --> 01:31:22,108
             All right.
             What about Julian?

1907
01:31:22,144 --> 01:31:24,211
          Are you keeping him
          or can you spare him?

       What are you doing
       coming through
       the window like that?

2035
01:37:39,521 --> 01:37:41,721
 Can't expect me
 to come through
 the hall like that.

2036
01:37:44,025 --> 01:37:45,658
 Julian, don't feel
 too bad about this.

2037
01:37:45,694 --> 01:37:48,228
 You'll get over it...
            I'll be fine, Toni.

2038
01:37:48,263 --> 01:37:49,762
          You broke up my home.

2039
01:37:49,798 --> 01:37:52,932
      You took me from my wife.
      You alienated me
      from my children.

2040
01:37:52,968 --> 01:37:55,535

             with me tonight?

   Okay. I'll put
   some clothes on.

            I thought you quit.

2049
01:39:14,916 --> 01:39:16,716
 I came to pick up
 my cactus.

2050
01:39:16,751 --> 01:39:19,052
 What are you doing
 in the office
 on a Saturday?

2051
01:39:19,087 --> 01:39:21,421
           Last night I had
           12 Mexican Missiles,

2052
01:39:21,456 --> 01:39:24,057
              and this is where
              I splashed down.

2053
01:39:24,092 --> 01:39:25,725
 Is everything all right
 between you and Toni?

2054
01:39:25,760 --> 01:39:27,627
          Oh, yes. Things are
          all straightened out.

 Well, I'm not
 very happy for me.

2059
01:39:39,975 --> 01:39:41,274
         I went to see her
         and I told her

2060
01:39:41,309 --> 01:39:43,710
     that you wouldn't agree
     to a divorce.

2063
01:39:48,316 --> 01:39:51,084
    Nothing, except that
    I went to Toni and told her
    that we weren't married.

2064
01:39:51,119 --> 01:39:52,819
    Why'd you do that?

2065
01:39:52,854 --> 01:39:56,656
      I thought I'd fix things.
      At least somebody
      would get what he wanted.

           to go there and lie?

2068
01:40:01,596 --> 01:40:05,398
 Because it was
 the only way I could
 get out of marrying her.

2069
01:40:05,433 --> 01:40:07,200
            Don't you want
            to marry her?

2070
01:40:07,235 --> 01:40:08,735
 No. It's always
 been a mistake

2071
01:40:08,770 --> 01:40:11,304
       and when I caught her
       with Igor, I knew it.

2072
01:40:11,339 --> 01:40:13,139
               But she thinks
               Igor is a child.

2073
01:40:13,174 --> 01:40:16,209
      I know. I saw him come
      through the window
      with a diaper on.

2074
01:40:16,244 --> 01:40:19,679

            and got drunk.

 No, no. You don't understand.
 You see, when I left there,
 I was angry.

   Absolutely furious!
   Homicidal!

2078

            a quart of tequila?

 and then suddenly
 it was like magic.

   and I suddenly felt
   a delicious sense of relief.

2082

      "Julian, thank God,
      at last you're out of it.

           to your wife."

     singing to myself,

2085
01:40:46,808 --> 01:40:49,208
      and I suddenly remembered
      I had no wife.

   to the office,
   you wouldn't be here either.
