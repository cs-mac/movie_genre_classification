1
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:53,395
Is that you, Samuel?

2
00:03:55,868 --> 00:03:59,269
Yes...
Yes, my bun, it's only me.

3
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,737
Is the...

4
00:04:12,652 --> 00:04:13,949
Is the...

5
00:04:25,965 --> 00:04:28,229
Is the dinner
on the table, dear?

6
00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:29,962
On the table and off,

7
00:04:30,036 --> 00:04:31,128
five hours ago!

8
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:32,432
Don't exaggerate.

9
00:04:32,505 --> 00:04:34,063
It's only the shank
of the evening.

10
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:35,334
Half past eight.

11
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:37,876
<i>MAN ON RADIO.; We will now give you
the correct time. Half past eight.</i>

12
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:40,310
<i>When you hear the sound of
the gong, it will be exactly...</i>

13
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,348
8:30.
Take off your hat!

14
00:04:43,316 --> 00:04:44,408
Where have you been?

15
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:47,118
Don't answer! I know
what you're going to say.

16
00:04:47,186 --> 00:04:49,677
"Down at the shop,
working on an invention."

17
00:04:49,756 --> 00:04:51,348
If you was married
to Thomas Edison...

18
00:04:51,424 --> 00:04:53,324
You're no Edison,
Sam Bisbee.

19
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:55,657
No, and you're no prophet,
Mrs. Bisbee.

20
00:04:55,728 --> 00:04:56,854
If you've no regard for me,

21
00:04:56,929 --> 00:04:59,397
you might at least have some regard
for your daughter's happiness.

22
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:02,025
My daughter's the happiest
little girl in the world.

23
00:05:02,101 --> 00:05:04,968
Her silvery laughter rings out
from early morn

24
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:07,768
till late at night.
Till late at night.

25
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,831
Yeah.
Yes, very late.

26
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:11,274
But not in her own home,
it doesn't...

27
00:05:11,344 --> 00:05:12,868
Take those shoes
off the table.

28
00:05:12,945 --> 00:05:14,776
Who was putting them
on the table?

29
00:05:16,215 --> 00:05:18,581
Where is she now?
What's she doing?

30
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:20,084
Who's she with?

31
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:22,121
I don't have to worry
about my daughter.

32
00:05:22,188 --> 00:05:23,883
Well,
you'd better worry.

33
00:05:23,956 --> 00:05:26,925
She wouldn't be out if she wasn't
ashamed of her home, ashamed of you.

34
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:28,551
Me?
Look at you.

35
00:05:28,795 --> 00:05:30,626
Suppose she were entertaining
a nice young man in her home,

36
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:32,460
and you came in
looking like that,

37
00:05:32,532 --> 00:05:34,397
with your shoes off,
your suspenders down,

38
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:36,162
and your breath
smelling of cheap liquor.

39
00:05:36,235 --> 00:05:38,601
Cheap? Four dollars a gallon.

40
00:05:39,572 --> 00:05:41,767
My daughter ashamed
of my suspenders?

41
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:43,809
There she is now
with that Bob Murchison,

42
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,307
that no-good...

43
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:47,976
What did I tell you?

44
00:05:48,047 --> 00:05:49,708
I forgot.
What? Oh, yeah.

45
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:52,651
Kissing him.
Kissing who?

46
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:54,744
Bob Murchison.
Who's kissing Bob Murchison?

47
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:56,345
Pauline, our...

48
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:01,660
Well, that's life, dear.

49
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:03,628
Girls will be girls.

50
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:07,097
When I was a little boy,
I used to kiss little girls.

51
00:06:10,002 --> 00:06:12,163
A rich man's son making
a fool of your daughter,

52
00:06:12,238 --> 00:06:13,728
and you stand there.

53
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:18,105
No rich man's son will ever make
a fool of Sam Bisbee's daughter.

54
00:06:18,444 --> 00:06:21,004
You might as well
get that in your...

55
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,677
That's the...
Take of that hat!

56
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:28,084
I'm sorry.

57
00:06:37,764 --> 00:06:40,494
There. There they are, right in my hand.

58
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:42,693
Good night, Bob.

59
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:48,769
I know how to solve
our problem.

60
00:06:48,841 --> 00:06:50,331
No, no, Bob.

61
00:06:51,811 --> 00:06:53,039
You won't elope with me?

62
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,869
No.

63
00:06:55,481 --> 00:06:56,948
You won't let me
elope with you?

64
00:06:57,383 --> 00:06:58,372
No.

65
00:07:00,553 --> 00:07:02,544
What's keeping us apart?

66
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:04,784
Haven't you heard?

67
00:07:05,725 --> 00:07:07,522
The railroad tracks.

68
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:18,434
Twenty years married to a man
like you is enough for any woman...

69
00:07:18,504 --> 00:07:19,698
Give him a rest, Mom.

70
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:22,400
Say, you little night owl.

71
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:25,074
What do you mean by staying
out the middle of the...

72
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:29,108
The middle of half past eight? Who, me?

73
00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:31,673
Yes, you. Running
around with that clown.

74
00:07:31,751 --> 00:07:33,116
Never let it
be said that...

75
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:35,416
Hey, you left your gadget
on the doorknob.

76
00:07:37,356 --> 00:07:39,847
Your father and I think this thing
between you and that Murchison boy

77
00:07:39,926 --> 00:07:41,086
has gone far enough.
Yes.

78
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,320
He doesn't seem to think so.

79
00:07:42,395 --> 00:07:44,226
He just asked me
to marry him.

80
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:46,561
Marry him? Darling.

81
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,359
Hey, didn't I tell you?
I knew it all the time.

82
00:07:49,435 --> 00:07:50,629
Oh, shut up!

83
00:07:50,703 --> 00:07:52,864
He really wants to
marry you? Well, why not?

84
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:55,772
I'm young and healthy and
full of the devil. Pauline!

85
00:07:55,842 --> 00:07:57,241
Sure,
my little daughter

86
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,505
doesn't have to be in a
hurry to marry any man.

87
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:01,513
Pick and choose, dear.

88
00:08:02,014 --> 00:08:03,743
Liberty is sweet.

89
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:06,307
Once you're married,
it's just like being in jail.

90
00:08:08,521 --> 00:08:10,455
I guess I'll go to bed.

91
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:13,386
Look out!

92
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:15,154
Don't get tangled up
in that thing again.

93
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:17,662
I won't get tangled up
in nothing.

94
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:28,636
I'm going upstairs.

95
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:33,042
It's worse than flypaper.

96
00:08:33,112 --> 00:08:37,208
Might as well have some flypaper
curtains in the house as that...

97
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:03,071
You know, Charlie,
I've been thinking about...

98
00:09:03,142 --> 00:09:05,440
Look out!
Don't sit down there.

99
00:09:05,511 --> 00:09:07,843
That's another
of my inventions.

100
00:09:07,914 --> 00:09:10,246
It's what I call
the "murder chair."

101
00:09:10,316 --> 00:09:12,841
When a burglar comes in here
and says, "Stick 'em up,"

102
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:15,444
I get friendly with him.
I say, "Have a drink."

103
00:09:15,521 --> 00:09:17,682
Then I invite him
to sit down in the chair.

104
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:20,988
When he sits in the chair
he releases that lever.

105
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,652
The iron ball comes up

106
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:24,753
and smites him
upon the sconce,

107
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:28,723
thus knocking him
deader than a doornail.

108
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:30,866
Now, don't either of you boys
ever sit in that chair.

109
00:09:30,937 --> 00:09:32,837
Put that down,
will you, Doc?

110
00:09:33,005 --> 00:09:35,872
Soon as I get this tire on the market,
I'll sell a lot of these things.

111
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:37,307
How's the tire coming,
Sam?

112
00:09:37,376 --> 00:09:38,866
Coming? It's perfected.

113
00:09:38,945 --> 00:09:40,537
Get over there, and I'll
give you a demonstration.

114
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:41,773
Get over, Doc.

115
00:09:47,954 --> 00:09:50,115
Now, give that wheel a spin.

116
00:09:51,357 --> 00:09:53,621
Good. Now, stand clear, boys.

117
00:10:05,304 --> 00:10:07,602
That's a puncture-proof tire.

118
00:10:07,673 --> 00:10:09,265
Say, that's pretty good.

119
00:10:09,575 --> 00:10:11,975
Pretty good? It's perfect!

120
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:15,480
I've got nothing to worry about
now for the rest of my life.

121
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:32,328
Hello.
Hello.

122
00:10:32,398 --> 00:10:33,922
Do I work fast?

123
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,231
My mother is calling on your
mother this afternoon at 4:00.

124
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:39,362
But, Bob, why?
What happened?

125
00:10:39,438 --> 00:10:42,134
Well, after what you said
last night about my family,

126
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:44,403
I decided to have it out
with them. I know, darling.

127
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,468
But why does she have
to call on us today?

128
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:48,237
What'd you say to her?

129
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:49,679
Nothing much.

130
00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:51,979
I merely said I was going
to marry Pauline Bisbee.

131
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:53,814
You did?
I did.

132
00:10:54,754 --> 00:10:55,982
And I am.

133
00:10:56,188 --> 00:10:58,281
Mother's very much
interested in meeting you.

134
00:10:58,357 --> 00:10:59,824
I'll bet she is.

135
00:10:59,892 --> 00:11:01,757
Well, I'd better go
and break the news,

136
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:03,852
and if you see ten women
being carried out of here

137
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:06,762
kicking and screaming,
that'll be my mother.

138
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:08,395
Goodbye.

139
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:12,336
Howdy, boys!
Hello, Bill.

140
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:14,270
Say, Sam, I got
a special delivery.

141
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,740
Registered airmail letter,
here, for you.

142
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:21,470
Sam. Sam.

143
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:23,813
What's the matter with him?

144
00:11:23,883 --> 00:11:25,851
Sound sleeper,
that's all.

145
00:11:26,252 --> 00:11:27,719
Hey, Sam!

146
00:11:32,558 --> 00:11:34,549
Registered letter.
Sign for it.

147
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:38,756
Sign for me, will you, Doc?

148
00:11:48,107 --> 00:11:51,372
She didn't work out as well
as I thought she would.

149
00:11:52,344 --> 00:11:54,835
Ought to put
a heavier ball on there.

150
00:12:07,293 --> 00:12:08,954
"Samuel Bisbee...

151
00:12:10,162 --> 00:12:11,595
"Dear sir.

152
00:12:11,664 --> 00:12:16,328
"Your letter, at hand, regarding
your Bisbee Puncture-Proof Tire.

153
00:12:16,836 --> 00:12:20,966
"If you care to demonstrate
your invention to our company,

154
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:25,272
"the Board will meet you
Saturday, June 12, at 2:00,

155
00:12:25,344 --> 00:12:27,073
"in our main office."

156
00:12:27,146 --> 00:12:28,443
That's great, Sam!

157
00:12:28,514 --> 00:12:31,176
Yes, I guess I finally
put one over. Yes, sir.

158
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,979
Come on, Charlie,
help me get this tire off.

159
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:47,463
Mrs. Bisbee?
I'm Mrs. Murchison.

160
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:48,659
How do you do?

161
00:12:49,568 --> 00:12:51,661
Won't you come in, please?
Thank you.

162
00:12:51,737 --> 00:12:54,171
So nice of you to call,
Mrs. Murchison. Not at all.

163
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,105
I'm sure you understand
why I'm here.

164
00:12:56,175 --> 00:12:58,109
My daughter told me
you were coming.

165
00:12:58,177 --> 00:13:00,372
It's about your daughter I've
come to see you, Mrs. Bisbee.

166
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:02,778
I suppose you already know
that my son,

167
00:13:02,848 --> 00:13:04,975
who is very young
and unsophisticated,

168
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:08,281
has been... Shall I
say, taken in by her?

169
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:09,588
Has been what?

170
00:13:09,655 --> 00:13:11,418
Well, fascinated by her.

171
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:13,515
Now he even talks of
wanting to marry her.

172
00:13:13,592 --> 00:13:17,585
Of course, with his social position,
his family and his future...

173
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:20,095
In short, the whole affair's
absurd, and I've come to...

174
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:24,159
And why is it absurd that your son
should want to marry my daughter?

175
00:13:24,336 --> 00:13:27,828
The women of the Warren family
have always been above reproach.

176
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:29,702
That is history.

177
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:30,999
The Warren family?

178
00:13:31,076 --> 00:13:33,772
You don't mean
the Warrens of Virginia?

179
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:37,247
My grandfather was General
Robert Henry Warren of Virginia.

180
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:38,783
Not really!

181
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:41,319
There,
you can see for yourself.

182
00:13:41,387 --> 00:13:43,582
Well, this is a surprise.

183
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,351
Of course,
you wouldn't recognize me.

184
00:13:45,424 --> 00:13:47,289
I'm the baby on his lap.

185
00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:51,318
That was taken on the veranda of
our old homestead in Warrenton.

186
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:55,660
You're sure this album
belongs to you?

187
00:13:57,102 --> 00:14:00,037
Quite sure.
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

188
00:14:00,272 --> 00:14:02,832
Then your daughter Pauline
is really a Warren!

189
00:14:02,908 --> 00:14:05,206
Well, of course,
that puts the whole affair

190
00:14:05,277 --> 00:14:06,642
in an entirely
different light.

191
00:14:55,327 --> 00:14:57,124
You all right, boy?
Yeah.

192
00:14:58,831 --> 00:15:00,321
Glad you weren't hurt.

193
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,627
That's a puncture-proof tire.

194
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:02,962
Couldn't hurt that tire.

195
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:05,265
Knock the tree down first.

196
00:15:06,338 --> 00:15:08,397
I still think Robert's
far too young to marry,

197
00:15:08,474 --> 00:15:11,773
and I was afraid some cheap
girl of vulgar family...

198
00:15:12,311 --> 00:15:13,403
You understand.

199
00:15:16,015 --> 00:15:18,040
Delicious, delicious!

200
00:15:18,784 --> 00:15:20,877
Robert tells me your husband
is a businessman.

201
00:15:20,953 --> 00:15:23,046
Yes, in a manner of speaking.

202
00:15:23,122 --> 00:15:26,421
However, his greatest
interest is in his inventions.

203
00:15:33,132 --> 00:15:34,997
May I ask,
what does he invent?

204
00:15:35,067 --> 00:15:36,932
Oh, various things.

205
00:15:37,469 --> 00:15:41,963
For instance, he's been
working, lately, on a tire.

206
00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:44,901
A tire?
An automobile tire?

207
00:15:44,977 --> 00:15:46,604
That's been
invented already.

208
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:49,880
An automobile tire
that cannot be punctured.

209
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,247
Oh, but that's
impossible surely.

210
00:15:53,585 --> 00:15:55,746
I've never heard
of any such tire.

211
00:15:55,821 --> 00:15:58,051
And if there'd been a demand
for a puncture-proof tire,

212
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:01,354
surely someone would've
invented one before this.

213
00:16:01,427 --> 00:16:04,919
They've been trying to
for 20 years, and here she is.

214
00:16:05,597 --> 00:16:08,691
Mrs. Murchison,
this is my husband.

215
00:16:09,868 --> 00:16:11,199
Your husband?

216
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:14,364
Well, this is a pleasant surprise.
I want to show you this tire.

217
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:17,034
Look at the resiliency in that
thing. I think I'd better be going.

218
00:16:17,109 --> 00:16:18,440
Samuel,

219
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:20,876
won't you please take
your invention out of here?

220
00:16:20,946 --> 00:16:22,436
All right.

221
00:16:26,352 --> 00:16:30,049
I take it Mr. Bisbee
did not come from Virginia.

222
00:16:30,122 --> 00:16:31,350
No.

223
00:16:31,423 --> 00:16:34,790
So Abigail's been telling you
her family history, eh?

224
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,487
Well,
you ain't seen a thing.

225
00:16:36,628 --> 00:16:38,596
Wait till I show you
the Bisbee clan.

226
00:16:39,365 --> 00:16:40,593
We were all Union men.

227
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:44,534
Sam, I don't think Mrs. Murchison
would be interested in those pictures.

228
00:16:44,603 --> 00:16:47,936
Oh, sure she would.
Real down-to-earth people.

229
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,869
Speak our language.

230
00:16:50,642 --> 00:16:54,373
Now, there's Uncle Bean.
Bean Bisbee, the tiger.

231
00:16:54,446 --> 00:16:56,141
Fight at the drop of a hat,

232
00:16:56,215 --> 00:17:00,515
and yet underneath it all as
tenderhearted as a baby lamb.

233
00:17:00,586 --> 00:17:02,247
Look at those eyes...

234
00:17:03,055 --> 00:17:05,387
Wrong picture.
That was Uncle Jim.

235
00:17:05,457 --> 00:17:08,358
He was the black sheep of the
family, until he got into politics.

236
00:17:08,427 --> 00:17:11,453
Now he's got a big home
up at Passamaquoddy.

237
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,555
And that's Aunt Minnie,

238
00:17:13,632 --> 00:17:16,533
an angel of mercy if ever
there was one, and there was.

239
00:17:16,602 --> 00:17:19,594
Known from California
to Maine and back again.

240
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:22,432
Stay up all night
taking care of the boys,

241
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:23,975
night after night.

242
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:28,376
I really must be going now.

243
00:17:28,447 --> 00:17:31,939
Wait a minute. I want to show
you my private art collection.

244
00:17:32,017 --> 00:17:33,507
Okay, Abigail?

245
00:17:38,824 --> 00:17:39,813
Oh!

246
00:17:40,826 --> 00:17:42,817
Not bad, eh?

247
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:44,192
Get the knee action?

248
00:17:44,763 --> 00:17:46,856
And stands without hitching!

249
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:48,760
Another relative, I presume.

250
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:49,766
No, no, no.

251
00:17:49,835 --> 00:17:52,395
Just a little girl I met down
in the New Hebrides Islands.

252
00:17:56,141 --> 00:17:57,438
Hello.
Hello.

253
00:17:57,509 --> 00:17:58,908
What's the news
from the front?

254
00:17:58,977 --> 00:18:00,945
All quiet, up to now.

255
00:18:01,013 --> 00:18:02,878
Shall we take a chance?
Now or never!

256
00:18:02,948 --> 00:18:05,781
Your naive gaucherie is amazing. Huh?

257
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:07,842
I said
your naive gaucherie.

258
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,009
Oh, yes.

259
00:18:09,121 --> 00:18:11,749
Thanks, thanks very much.
Nice of you to mention that.

260
00:18:11,824 --> 00:18:14,156
So this is the family
my son wants to marry into.

261
00:18:14,226 --> 00:18:16,956
Yes, it is.
I really can't believe it.

262
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:19,361
The whole affair will be
definitely broken up at once.

263
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:20,591
We shall
disinherit Robert

264
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:22,293
sooner than consent
to a marriage as...

265
00:18:22,367 --> 00:18:24,597
As impossible
as this one is!

266
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:27,435
Why, I'll crack her
in the eye.

267
00:18:27,506 --> 00:18:29,371
Come, Robert.
Just a moment, Mother.

268
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:33,100
I don't know what's happened, but
I'm sure my mother doesn't mean...

269
00:18:33,178 --> 00:18:35,510
Your mother means everything
she has said and more!

270
00:18:35,581 --> 00:18:38,379
But, Mother, you can't talk
to Pauline's family like that.

271
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:39,712
What's happened?

272
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:41,980
Tell me. What is it? Your father.

273
00:18:42,054 --> 00:18:44,579
Everything was lovely,
then he came in.

274
00:18:44,656 --> 00:18:46,419
Me? What'd I do?
Never mind, Dad.

275
00:18:46,492 --> 00:18:47,982
They don't understand you.
That's all.

276
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,425
I meant
every word I said.

277
00:18:49,495 --> 00:18:50,962
I'm ashamed that
my son should...

278
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:52,963
You've said quite enough.
Now, please go.

279
00:18:53,031 --> 00:18:55,226
Bob, take your mother out
of here and don't come back.

280
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,029
Pauline,
I can explain everything.

281
00:18:57,102 --> 00:18:58,296
Say, who started all this?

282
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:00,065
Come, Robert.
Have you no pride left?

283
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:02,664
Don't you even know when
you've been ordered out?

284
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:05,233
Pauline.
Goodbye.

285
00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:08,847
You better go, son. You've
caused enough trouble around here.

286
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:17,411
Well, I guess I told him.

287
00:19:18,357 --> 00:19:20,587
Yes, you certainly
fixed that up.

288
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:22,718
You've got nothing
to worry about.

289
00:19:22,794 --> 00:19:26,321
I got a letter from the National
Tire Company right here in my pocket.

290
00:19:26,398 --> 00:19:27,990
Well,
isn't that just dandy.

291
00:19:28,066 --> 00:19:30,626
Now, I suppose I can marry
a balloon tire.

292
00:19:30,702 --> 00:19:33,694
Well, I've been married
to one for 20 years,

293
00:19:33,772 --> 00:19:35,763
and a flat one at that!

294
00:19:37,075 --> 00:19:39,543
Now, you two,
listen to this letter.

295
00:19:39,711 --> 00:19:41,076
"Mr. Samuel Bisbee...

296
00:19:42,247 --> 00:19:43,373
"Dear sir.

297
00:19:43,448 --> 00:19:47,680
"Your letter, at hand, regarding
the Bisbee Puncture-Proof Tire.

298
00:19:47,753 --> 00:19:50,313
"If you care to
demonstrate your..."

299
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:29,055
Mr. Samuel Bisbee.

300
00:20:37,536 --> 00:20:41,199
Mr. Bisbee? I'm Mr. Robbins,
the president of the company.

301
00:20:41,506 --> 00:20:44,031
Pardon my glove. Glad
to know you, Mr. Robbins.

302
00:20:44,109 --> 00:20:45,906
Gentlemen, Mr. Bisbee.
How do you do?

303
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:47,445
Gentlemen, glad to know you.

304
00:20:47,512 --> 00:20:49,104
Are you ready to
show us your invention?

305
00:20:49,181 --> 00:20:51,149
I'll be with you
in half a tick.

306
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:53,384
What's the idea
of the arsenal?

307
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:54,608
Going target shooting?

308
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,051
Use that for
demonstrating purposes.

309
00:20:56,121 --> 00:20:57,383
Hey, what's this?

310
00:20:57,789 --> 00:20:59,882
That's another
of my inventions.

311
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:02,150
I call it
the "nose lifter-upper."

312
00:21:02,394 --> 00:21:05,420
Makes breathing easy
and prevents snoring.

313
00:21:05,497 --> 00:21:07,089
However, that's not for sale.

314
00:21:07,165 --> 00:21:08,154
And this?

315
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:12,164
This makes scrubbing floors
a pleasure.

316
00:21:12,371 --> 00:21:16,102
Put one on each foot, and
use the sponge as a polo ball.

317
00:21:16,174 --> 00:21:17,300
What's this?

318
00:21:18,043 --> 00:21:19,032
Twins.

319
00:21:20,412 --> 00:21:22,107
That's not for sale
just at present.

320
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:24,273
I thought we came here
to see a puncture-proof tire.

321
00:21:24,349 --> 00:21:25,748
Yes. Did you bring a tire with you?

322
00:21:25,817 --> 00:21:28,718
I have four tires
on my car, downstairs.

323
00:21:28,854 --> 00:21:30,014
If you'll follow me,

324
00:21:30,088 --> 00:21:31,146
I'll give you
a demonstration

325
00:21:31,223 --> 00:21:33,783
of a 1000%
puncture-proof tire,

326
00:21:33,925 --> 00:21:35,620
the Bisbee
Puncture-Proof Tire.

327
00:21:35,694 --> 00:21:36,786
All right, gentlemen,
let's go.

328
00:21:36,862 --> 00:21:38,329
I don't like his looks.
He acts like a maniac.

329
00:21:38,397 --> 00:21:39,864
He's harmless.
Yes?

330
00:21:39,931 --> 00:21:41,364
Oh, pardon me.
Okay.

331
00:21:43,402 --> 00:21:46,030
Help me push this heap down the line.

332
00:22:09,294 --> 00:22:11,194
Looks just like
an ordinary tire to me.

333
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:12,628
Give him a chance.

334
00:22:12,698 --> 00:22:15,565
All right, thank you, gentlemen.
Will you please stand back?

335
00:22:17,436 --> 00:22:19,233
These bullets bounce.

336
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:24,571
I'm going to show you a real
1000% puncture-proof tire.

337
00:22:34,252 --> 00:22:35,742
That's funny.

338
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:38,781
I'll try the other one.

339
00:22:46,164 --> 00:22:48,428
I told you he was just
another fool inventor.

340
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,899
I guess you're right.

341
00:22:50,669 --> 00:22:52,534
You think so, eh?

342
00:22:52,604 --> 00:22:54,868
Well, I tell you, I haven't
crossed on those front tires,

343
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,737
but I put
the rear tires on myself.

344
00:22:56,808 --> 00:22:57,934
I'm going to prove...

345
00:22:58,276 --> 00:22:59,675
Watch this.

346
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:03,673
Now, this'll be
a different story.

347
00:23:11,456 --> 00:23:13,424
They're a huge success!

348
00:23:13,825 --> 00:23:15,486
A perfect case of deflation!

349
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:23,394
<i>OFFICER ON RADIO.;
Calling all cars.</i>

350
00:23:23,668 --> 00:23:27,160
<i>Maniac shooting up cars on
Main Street. That is all.</i>

351
00:23:30,008 --> 00:23:32,806
Hey, what are you doing there? Hey!

352
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:54,362
Where you going? Where
I usually go on Sundays.

353
00:23:55,901 --> 00:23:57,391
Church?
Yes.

354
00:23:58,637 --> 00:24:01,197
I thought I might go
to church, myself, today.

355
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:02,968
Mother's going with me.

356
00:24:04,543 --> 00:24:06,443
You know why I'm here.

357
00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:09,306
I can't stay away from you.

358
00:24:10,148 --> 00:24:11,615
I called you
all day yesterday.

359
00:24:11,683 --> 00:24:13,878
I know.
I wanted to answer.

360
00:24:14,986 --> 00:24:16,977
Oh, Bob, it's no use.

361
00:24:17,322 --> 00:24:19,256
I've thought it all out.

362
00:24:19,324 --> 00:24:22,691
I'll come by for you tonight, and
we'll drive to Stanton and get married.

363
00:24:22,761 --> 00:24:25,753
I have more pride than
to marry into a family that...

364
00:24:25,831 --> 00:24:27,423
That thinks
they're too good for me.

365
00:24:27,499 --> 00:24:29,228
Mother didn't mean that.

366
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:31,132
She was just annoyed
with your dad.

367
00:24:31,203 --> 00:24:32,534
Well, Dad suits me.

368
00:24:33,004 --> 00:24:36,371
I think he has just as good
manners as your mother has.

369
00:24:36,441 --> 00:24:37,738
Don't go.

370
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:39,302
Your dad's all right.

371
00:24:39,377 --> 00:24:40,571
You bet he is!

372
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:42,943
And when he gets back from putting
that big deal over in the city,

373
00:24:43,014 --> 00:24:45,073
why, we'll have
as much money as you have.

374
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,174
You wait and see.

375
00:24:46,251 --> 00:24:48,219
Are you two children
quarreling?

376
00:24:48,286 --> 00:24:51,187
Good morning, Mrs. Bisbee.
Good morning, Mr. Murchison.

377
00:24:51,256 --> 00:24:52,553
Coming to church,
Pauline?

378
00:24:52,624 --> 00:24:53,784
Yes, Mother.

379
00:24:55,227 --> 00:24:56,558
Pauline.

380
00:24:56,962 --> 00:24:58,088
Goodbye, Bob.

381
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,730
This is final.

382
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:51,107
There goes Sam Bisbee,
drunker than a hoot owl.

383
00:25:51,182 --> 00:25:52,410
Is he a hard drinker?

384
00:25:52,684 --> 00:25:54,879
Hard? It's the easiest thing
he does.

385
00:25:59,658 --> 00:26:03,185
Looks like I'm holding you
up. No, I got plenty of time.

386
00:26:03,261 --> 00:26:04,319
Pardon me.

387
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:07,524
I should have brought
a little Vaseline with me.

388
00:26:11,703 --> 00:26:15,195
By golly, I put over
a big deal today!

389
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:18,705
Will my wife and kids
be tickled to death.

390
00:27:37,255 --> 00:27:39,746
Oh, I beg your pardon.
It was the wind.

391
00:28:03,715 --> 00:28:05,239
"Goodwill tour."

392
00:28:06,651 --> 00:28:08,016
If they only knew,
Rosita.

393
00:28:08,086 --> 00:28:10,054
But you must forget him,
Your Highness.

394
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:12,781
Could you,
if you were I?

395
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:14,381
Yes, officially.

396
00:28:14,726 --> 00:28:16,421
Confidentially, no.

397
00:28:17,896 --> 00:28:21,764
So I am to forget Michael,
and marry the crown prince.

398
00:28:21,833 --> 00:28:23,357
But I can't forget Michael.

399
00:28:23,435 --> 00:28:24,800
But you must.

400
00:28:25,804 --> 00:28:27,601
You're right, Rosita.

401
00:28:28,173 --> 00:28:29,868
I must forget him.

402
00:28:32,077 --> 00:28:34,136
Why,
you've cut your finger.

403
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:36,476
One moment, Your Highness.
The iodine.

404
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:38,175
It's nothing, Rosita.

405
00:28:38,249 --> 00:28:41,013
Nothing serious, but
we must take no chances.

406
00:28:41,086 --> 00:28:42,815
I'll call Nicholas.

407
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:11,877
I bet he's got a woman in
there! I wouldn't be surprised.

408
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,047
There! What did I tell you?

409
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:24,661
I beg your pardon.
I beg yours!

410
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:28,463
I thought this was the
gentlemen's drawing account,

411
00:29:28,533 --> 00:29:30,933
the washout.

412
00:29:31,002 --> 00:29:33,095
If you don't mind,
I think, perhaps...

413
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:36,736
I'm going right away.
I beg your pardon.

414
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:49,386
What's this?

415
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:52,552
What are you up to?

416
00:29:53,091 --> 00:29:56,151
Don't do it, little lady.
It don't pay.

417
00:29:57,228 --> 00:29:58,855
When you wake up
in the morning

418
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:00,795
and find yourself dead,

419
00:30:00,865 --> 00:30:02,992
it's too late to regret it.

420
00:30:03,868 --> 00:30:05,267
What are you talking about?

421
00:30:05,403 --> 00:30:07,371
Don't commit suicide.

422
00:30:07,438 --> 00:30:10,134
You're too young.
You're too beautiful.

423
00:30:10,208 --> 00:30:12,199
I got here just in time.

424
00:30:12,577 --> 00:30:14,169
What makes you think that I...

425
00:30:14,245 --> 00:30:17,510
I was going to
do the same thing.

426
00:30:17,582 --> 00:30:18,674
You?

427
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:21,810
On this train,
not five minutes ago.

428
00:30:33,865 --> 00:30:35,799
Suppose I'd have
sent a telegram

429
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:38,268
I'd have had to
go through with it.

430
00:30:40,371 --> 00:30:41,861
How terrible.

431
00:30:42,273 --> 00:30:43,399
Awful.

432
00:30:45,143 --> 00:30:46,906
Are you so unhappy?

433
00:30:50,114 --> 00:30:54,244
Little lady, you think
you've got troubles?

434
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,347
Listen to mine.

435
00:31:00,658 --> 00:31:04,492
I lost my car,
I lost my tires,

436
00:31:04,562 --> 00:31:06,962
and I lost my patent
nose-lifter-upper.

437
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:08,555
Nose-lifter-upper?

438
00:31:08,633 --> 00:31:11,727
Yeah, nose-lifter-upper.
The only one in existence.

439
00:31:11,803 --> 00:31:14,271
My own invention.
Poor man.

440
00:31:14,339 --> 00:31:18,366
When I get back to town,
everybody'll laugh at me,

441
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:21,938
except my wife.
She won't think it's funny.

442
00:31:23,248 --> 00:31:24,943
She'll murder me.

443
00:31:25,516 --> 00:31:27,780
But can't you explain to her
as you explained to me?

444
00:31:27,852 --> 00:31:31,219
No. You don't know my wife.

445
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:34,517
The other night
we had some folks to dinner.

446
00:31:34,592 --> 00:31:36,219
I said, "Abigail, dear,

447
00:31:36,494 --> 00:31:38,826
"is it okay
if I take my vest off?"

448
00:31:39,697 --> 00:31:43,189
She said, "You don't mind
keeping your pants on, do you?"

449
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:48,736
Uncalled-for sarcasm.

450
00:31:56,014 --> 00:31:59,506
Yeah,
the great commoner, Bryan,

451
00:32:00,218 --> 00:32:02,413
almost went through
our town one time.

452
00:32:02,487 --> 00:32:04,011
Really?
Yes.

453
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:06,754
Crystal Springs.
Thank you.

454
00:32:15,166 --> 00:32:17,862
Has he come out yet?
No, he's still in there.

455
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:21,295
I feel sorry for
my little daughter.

456
00:32:21,372 --> 00:32:23,772
I depended upon this trip
to put her over.

457
00:32:23,841 --> 00:32:25,069
Have you a daughter?

458
00:32:25,143 --> 00:32:26,974
Yes, she's a sweet kid,

459
00:32:27,578 --> 00:32:29,478
but she's in love
with a rich clown.

460
00:32:29,547 --> 00:32:30,775
Clown?

461
00:32:31,149 --> 00:32:33,174
Son of the Murchison family,

462
00:32:33,918 --> 00:32:36,443
the richest people
in Crystal Springs.

463
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:38,722
Oh, I see. Society.

464
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:41,122
Yeah. Mrs. Murchison!

465
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:45,024
Looks like
an old Newfoundland dog.

466
00:32:45,096 --> 00:32:46,586
Don't you care for society?

467
00:32:46,664 --> 00:32:48,222
We don't go in for it.

468
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:50,096
We live on the other side
of the railroad tracks.

469
00:32:50,168 --> 00:32:51,533
But you wouldn't
understand that.

470
00:32:51,602 --> 00:32:53,092
I think I understand.

471
00:32:53,171 --> 00:32:54,638
It's the same in my country,

472
00:32:54,706 --> 00:32:56,537
only we call it
"class distinction."

473
00:32:56,607 --> 00:32:58,973
Yeah, we still call it
railroad tracks.

474
00:33:01,546 --> 00:33:03,207
Here's my little daughter.

475
00:33:03,715 --> 00:33:05,808
It's my wife
on the other side.

476
00:33:05,883 --> 00:33:07,407
She's lovely...
Isn't she a honey?

477
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:09,112
She's lovely.

478
00:33:09,187 --> 00:33:11,155
It's sad to be
young and in love

479
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:12,983
and not to marry
the loved one.

480
00:33:13,424 --> 00:33:15,619
Don't you think so, Mr...

481
00:33:15,693 --> 00:33:18,753
Bisbee's the name, but my
friends all call me Sam.

482
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,354
All right, Sam.

483
00:33:20,431 --> 00:33:22,831
But your daughter should
marry the man she loves.

484
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:25,494
There must be a way,
in this country.

485
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:28,767
Only a fairy princess
could put it over now,

486
00:33:29,307 --> 00:33:31,036
and there ain't
no such thing.

487
00:33:31,109 --> 00:33:33,043
Don't be too sure, Sam.

488
00:33:33,111 --> 00:33:36,512
You never can tell when a fairy
princess might come to your rescue.

489
00:33:36,581 --> 00:33:38,913
Thanks, thanks, Miss...
What's your name?

490
00:33:38,983 --> 00:33:40,450
My friends call me Marie.

491
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:41,917
Thanks, Marie.

492
00:33:41,986 --> 00:33:43,920
If you ever get down
to Crystal Springs,

493
00:33:43,988 --> 00:33:45,956
you must stop in
to see us.

494
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:48,959
My wife and daughter would be
tickled to death to see you.

495
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:50,756
Well, I hope
I haven't bored you.

496
00:33:50,828 --> 00:33:52,819
Bored me?
You've saved my life.

497
00:33:52,897 --> 00:33:56,389
Well, thank you. Goodbye.

498
00:33:56,467 --> 00:33:58,992
Crystal Springs.
Don't forget it.

499
00:34:03,007 --> 00:34:04,599
What time do we get
to Crystal Springs?

500
00:34:04,675 --> 00:34:07,701
Crystal Springs?
We just passed it.

501
00:34:07,779 --> 00:34:09,041
Why didn't you call it out?

502
00:34:09,113 --> 00:34:11,673
I did, sir, but you was too
busy with that lady back there.

503
00:34:11,749 --> 00:34:13,478
Oh, drat!

504
00:34:17,755 --> 00:34:21,623
When do we get to the next
stop? Albian, 40 miles.

505
00:34:23,661 --> 00:34:24,992
Drat!

506
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:27,387
Drat!

507
00:34:31,135 --> 00:34:32,397
Drat!

508
00:34:39,043 --> 00:34:40,772
You sent for me,
Your Highness?

509
00:34:40,845 --> 00:34:42,472
What engagements have we,
Nicholas?

510
00:34:42,547 --> 00:34:46,347
Tonight, the usual reception
by the city officials.

511
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:47,441
Tomorrow?

512
00:34:47,518 --> 00:34:49,850
Tomorrow,
Your Highness rests.

513
00:34:50,855 --> 00:34:55,883
Excellent. That fits in perfectly
with an idea I have in mind.

514
00:34:59,664 --> 00:35:02,394
I saw Sam Bisbee
on the train coming home.

515
00:35:02,467 --> 00:35:06,028
He was drunk and making love to one
of them painted dolls in a compartment.

516
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:07,332
Did you say
anything to him?

517
00:35:07,405 --> 00:35:10,533
I was just going to tell him, "Sam
Bisbee, what would your wife say?"

518
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:12,269
And what do you
suppose he did?

519
00:35:12,343 --> 00:35:16,643
He leered at me, gave me an evil
wink, and slammed the door in my face.

520
00:35:16,714 --> 00:35:19,239
And they went right on through
town. He didn't even get off.

521
00:35:19,317 --> 00:35:22,286
What do you suppose
they did in there, then?

522
00:35:22,353 --> 00:35:24,685
I don't pretend to know,
Sarah.

523
00:35:24,755 --> 00:35:26,689
It's entirely
out of my line.

524
00:35:26,991 --> 00:35:31,325
Sells his invention
in the city for $100,000,

525
00:35:31,395 --> 00:35:33,590
and then what does he do
with all that money?

526
00:35:33,664 --> 00:35:36,599
Runs off with
a notorious Russian dancer.

527
00:35:36,667 --> 00:35:40,603
No!
Yes. One of them Romanoffs.

528
00:35:40,671 --> 00:35:42,696
What's all the excitement about? Sam.

529
00:35:42,773 --> 00:35:44,001
Anything happen to him?

530
00:35:44,075 --> 00:35:45,940
Who'd have thought it.
Poor old Sam!

531
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:47,443
He ain't in trouble,
is he?

532
00:35:47,512 --> 00:35:48,877
Oh, boy, and how.

533
00:35:48,946 --> 00:35:50,379
Here's the way
I got the story.

534
00:35:50,448 --> 00:35:54,441
Sam goes on a tear up in the city and
picks up a woman, some foreign actress,

535
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:57,386
and he's going across the
country with her in a stateroom.

536
00:35:57,455 --> 00:36:01,221
They went through here, throwing
champagne bottles out of the window.

537
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,808
I tell you the best of
them are nothing but beasts.

538
00:36:17,875 --> 00:36:19,467
No, you can't trust
one of them.

539
00:36:19,544 --> 00:36:21,341
And isn't that
just like Sam Bisbee?

540
00:36:21,412 --> 00:36:23,676
Traipsing around the country
with a burlesque queen.

541
00:36:23,748 --> 00:36:24,908
She was sitting
on his lap,

542
00:36:24,982 --> 00:36:27,007
and he was drinking
champagne out of her slipper.

543
00:36:27,084 --> 00:36:29,075
When he sees
Mrs. Price is watching him,

544
00:36:29,153 --> 00:36:31,485
he gets up and slams
the door and locks it.

545
00:36:31,556 --> 00:36:32,887
You know
who she was?

546
00:36:32,957 --> 00:36:35,084
I think it was
one of them fan dancers.

547
00:36:39,997 --> 00:36:41,396
How do, Mrs. Price?

548
00:36:41,465 --> 00:36:44,059
How dare you speak
to a respectable woman!

549
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:48,862
What's wrong with her?

550
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:51,738
Hello. Lovely weather
we're having.

551
00:36:57,915 --> 00:37:00,611
Hello, Jane, how are
you? Fine, Mr. Bisbee.

552
00:37:00,685 --> 00:37:03,779
How are you?
I'm fine, thanks.

553
00:37:03,854 --> 00:37:05,344
How's your...

554
00:37:13,698 --> 00:37:14,960
Maybe that was it.

555
00:37:16,701 --> 00:37:19,192
Fellows, here's the sheik!
Hello, boys.

556
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:21,500
How was she, Sam?

557
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:23,039
Has she got a friend?

558
00:37:25,309 --> 00:37:28,710
What's the matter with you
guys? You all gone nuts?

559
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:34,350
I can't understand what's
happened to this town.

560
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:36,943
Everybody shuns me
like I had leprosy.

561
00:37:37,021 --> 00:37:39,080
We've been
hearing things, Sam.

562
00:37:39,156 --> 00:37:40,987
It was a tough break,
that's all.

563
00:37:41,058 --> 00:37:44,084
How did I know I was
shooting up a police car?

564
00:37:44,161 --> 00:37:46,686
Sam, Charlie and me
are your friends.

565
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:49,562
We're with you
no matter what, see?

566
00:37:49,634 --> 00:37:52,102
If ever I needed
friends in all my life,

567
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:53,903
I need them today.

568
00:37:54,238 --> 00:37:55,569
Who was she, Sam?

569
00:37:55,806 --> 00:37:56,966
Who was who?

570
00:37:57,041 --> 00:37:59,407
That woman you had
on the train.

571
00:38:06,484 --> 00:38:08,509
Oh, so that's it, is it?

572
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:13,955
Ain't it funny how much trouble
a man can get into innocently?

573
00:38:17,561 --> 00:38:20,428
Come on, Sam,
tell us who she was.

574
00:38:20,498 --> 00:38:24,059
She was the finest lady
I ever met in my life.

575
00:38:43,521 --> 00:38:46,217
Joke's on me, Sam.
Wrong jug.

576
00:38:48,192 --> 00:38:51,320
Try some of this
new blended stuff.

577
00:38:54,065 --> 00:38:56,260
It's a funny old world.

578
00:38:58,669 --> 00:39:01,638
A man's lucky
if he gets out of it alive.

579
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:01,528
I never met a princess before.

580
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:03,794
I never met anything
higher than an elk!

581
00:40:17,114 --> 00:40:18,877
Princess Lescaboura.

582
00:40:19,283 --> 00:40:21,046
I'm the Mayor
of Crystal Springs.

583
00:40:21,118 --> 00:40:22,176
I'm delighted.

584
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:23,982
Will you step
this way, please?

585
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:28,122
I'll be all right.
Take care of Rosita.

586
00:40:32,363 --> 00:40:34,888
May I present the Chairman of
our Entertainment Committee,

587
00:40:34,965 --> 00:40:37,456
Mrs. Edward Quimby Murchison.

588
00:40:37,535 --> 00:40:40,436
Oh, yes! I've heard
of Mrs. Murchison.

589
00:40:40,504 --> 00:40:42,938
Really? I'm charmed.

590
00:40:43,007 --> 00:40:45,737
My husband, Mr. Murchison.
Delighted.

591
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:48,074
Maybe you'd like to take
a little drive around the city

592
00:40:48,145 --> 00:40:49,942
or something,
eh, Your Majesty?

593
00:40:50,014 --> 00:40:51,879
Thank you. But I must
first see the friends

594
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:53,610
I've come to visit
in your charming city.

595
00:40:53,684 --> 00:40:55,879
We shall include them,
of course.

596
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:58,084
You're too kind.

597
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:00,052
Are you sure
you won't mind?

598
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:02,354
Princess! How could we?
Thank you.

599
00:41:05,262 --> 00:41:07,196
Well, well,
I don't see him.

600
00:41:07,264 --> 00:41:08,788
Him? Who?

601
00:41:08,866 --> 00:41:11,460
Everyone Your Highness might be
interested in meeting is here.

602
00:41:11,535 --> 00:41:13,127
I've seen to that.

603
00:41:13,204 --> 00:41:16,105
But I don't see my
old friend, Mr. Bisbee.

604
00:41:17,274 --> 00:41:19,572
Did she say Bisbee?
Bisbee?

605
00:41:20,845 --> 00:41:24,781
There is a Bisbee in our town, but
he's not one of our best citizens.

606
00:41:24,849 --> 00:41:28,808
Then it couldn't be the same
Bisbee. I mean Samuel Bisbee.

607
00:41:29,186 --> 00:41:30,676
Surely you don't mean...

608
00:41:30,754 --> 00:41:32,779
Not Sam Bisbee,
Your Highness?

609
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:35,583
Yes, Sam Bisbee.

610
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:38,822
A real hero
and one of nature's noblemen!

611
00:41:38,896 --> 00:41:41,194
A hero?
Sam Bisbee?

612
00:41:41,265 --> 00:41:44,029
No one will ever know what
he did for me during the war.

613
00:41:44,101 --> 00:41:47,093
What did he do for you,
if I'm not too inquisitive?

614
00:41:48,105 --> 00:41:49,800
He saved my life.

615
00:41:50,241 --> 00:41:53,608
Why... Your Royal Princess...
I mean, Your High Majesty,

616
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:56,305
if we'd have knowed it was
Sam Bisbee you was looking for,

617
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:59,076
we'd have had him
down here, but, gosh...

618
00:41:59,149 --> 00:42:00,810
Would it be
asking too much?

619
00:42:00,885 --> 00:42:02,409
Would you drive me
to his home?

620
00:42:02,486 --> 00:42:05,080
His home? You mean you
want to go to his house?

621
00:42:05,155 --> 00:42:06,713
Yes.

622
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:08,883
Why, it's a pleasure,
Your Majesty.

623
00:42:08,959 --> 00:42:09,948
Thank you.

624
00:42:10,995 --> 00:42:12,326
Where does Bisbee live?

625
00:42:12,396 --> 00:42:14,364
The other side
of the railroad tracks.

626
00:42:14,431 --> 00:42:16,399
Gosh all hemlock!

627
00:42:19,803 --> 00:42:21,862
We're sure it's the wrong
Bisbee, Your Highness,

628
00:42:21,939 --> 00:42:23,429
but if you insist.

629
00:42:23,507 --> 00:42:25,134
All ready, boys?

630
00:42:28,579 --> 00:42:31,514
What'd you tell her? Well,
what could I tell her, Sam?

631
00:42:31,582 --> 00:42:33,311
When your wife phoned
and asked me were you here,

632
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:35,079
I said you were
on the way home.

633
00:42:35,152 --> 00:42:37,643
I thought I was
doing you a favor.

634
00:42:40,357 --> 00:42:43,656
If I had enough money to pay
your back salary, I'd fire you!

635
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:47,295
Think I'll do it anyhow.

636
00:42:47,364 --> 00:42:49,389
Why don't you take
your wife home a present?

637
00:42:49,466 --> 00:42:51,229
A little pet of some kind.

638
00:42:51,302 --> 00:42:54,794
Women are crazy about pets.
They're just crazy.

639
00:42:54,872 --> 00:42:57,500
Pets haven't a thing to do
with it. Look at Charlie there.

640
00:42:57,575 --> 00:42:59,475
See what I'm taking
home for the old lady?

641
00:42:59,543 --> 00:43:03,377
It’ll take a bigger bird than
that to square me with my wife.

642
00:43:05,616 --> 00:43:06,947
Hey, pet man!

643
00:43:11,822 --> 00:43:12,846
Whoa, Myrtle!

644
00:43:12,923 --> 00:43:16,051
Hey! Myrtle! Look at Sam
with that funny-looking bird.

645
00:43:16,126 --> 00:43:19,061
Myrtle, look out! The
lamp post! The lamp post!

646
00:43:19,129 --> 00:43:20,687
Get down, Myrt!
Come on, now.

647
00:43:20,764 --> 00:43:22,527
Come on. Now you're okay.

648
00:43:24,301 --> 00:43:26,963
Now, come here!
Come here! Come here!

649
00:43:27,671 --> 00:43:30,834
Come back here!
Come here! Come here!

650
00:43:55,399 --> 00:43:57,128
Put your hat
over your head!

651
00:43:57,401 --> 00:43:58,527
It's a shame, Your Highness,

652
00:43:58,602 --> 00:44:01,594
you came all this way
only to find the wrong Bisbee.

653
00:44:05,909 --> 00:44:08,343
Edward! Edward!
Isn't that Bisbee?

654
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:11,807
Yes, my dear,
that's Bisbee.

655
00:44:11,882 --> 00:44:13,406
Well, stop him!
Stop him quickly!

656
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:15,952
Hi, boys!
Catch Bisbee there.

657
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:18,215
We want Bisbee.
Catch him. Stop him!

658
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:48,015
Come on, Myrt! Here.

659
00:44:48,085 --> 00:44:49,677
Mr. Bisbee!
Sam!

660
00:44:49,753 --> 00:44:51,846
Bisbee!
Sam!

661
00:44:53,791 --> 00:44:56,123
Come on up
out of there.

662
00:44:57,428 --> 00:45:00,363
Bisbee! Bisbee!
Old Sam, come here!

663
00:45:01,732 --> 00:45:04,860
Your old friend,
the Princess Lescaboura.

664
00:45:04,935 --> 00:45:06,766
Who?
Hello, Sam.

665
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:17,706
I'm afraid you girls
have the advantage of me.

666
00:45:17,981 --> 00:45:22,281
Surely you remember the girl whose
life you saved during the war?

667
00:45:28,859 --> 00:45:31,020
Marie! How are you?

668
00:45:31,095 --> 00:45:33,757
You're a sight for sore eyes!
Fancy meeting you here!

669
00:45:33,831 --> 00:45:35,992
We're conducting Her Royal
Highness to your home.

670
00:45:36,066 --> 00:45:38,591
Her Royal Highness?
The Princess Lescaboura.

671
00:45:39,103 --> 00:45:41,037
You are, eh? Well...

672
00:45:41,105 --> 00:45:42,629
We're on our way to your
house. Come along, Sam.

673
00:45:42,706 --> 00:45:44,333
Yes, do come, do come.

674
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:46,501
Say, I wouldn't ride in the
same carriage with that dame

675
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:48,442
for all the money
in the world.

676
00:45:50,814 --> 00:45:52,839
If you don't mind, I'll
give my place to Mr. Bisbee

677
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:54,008
and ride with the mayor.

678
00:45:54,084 --> 00:45:56,109
Thank you so much.
Come along, Sam.

679
00:45:56,186 --> 00:45:58,484
They rolls off my knife.

680
00:45:58,555 --> 00:46:00,455
Here, Murchie,
hold the chickadee.

681
00:46:00,524 --> 00:46:03,618
If she starts singing,
give her some birdseed.

682
00:46:06,296 --> 00:46:08,821
Well, Marie,
here we are again.

683
00:46:08,899 --> 00:46:13,336
I'm surprised you didn't recognize your
old friend, the Princess Lescaboura.

684
00:46:13,403 --> 00:46:14,802
Lescaboura!

685
00:46:16,106 --> 00:46:18,768
That's a funny name. How'd
you happen to think that up?

686
00:46:20,043 --> 00:46:22,534
That princess stuff's
a great idea.

687
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:25,711
Hope we can put it
over on the wife.

688
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:28,843
Must be a fire!
Maybe it's the ambulance!

689
00:46:31,088 --> 00:46:34,182
There she is now. Duck!

690
00:46:52,009 --> 00:46:54,842
How do you do, Mrs. Bisbee?
I'm so glad to see you.

691
00:46:54,912 --> 00:46:57,437
Isn't this an honor for our town? Honor?

692
00:46:57,514 --> 00:47:00,506
Why,
the Princess Lescaboura!

693
00:47:04,688 --> 00:47:07,248
Your Highness, have I your
permission to present Mrs. Bisbee

694
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:08,723
and her daughter, Pauline?

695
00:47:08,792 --> 00:47:11,260
I'm so happy to know you,
Mrs. Bisbee.

696
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:15,397
I think you're the luckiest
woman in the world.

697
00:47:15,465 --> 00:47:17,023
Is my husband dead?

698
00:47:17,134 --> 00:47:18,601
Not at all.

699
00:47:18,902 --> 00:47:22,668
And you, the daughter of my dear
friend and benefactor Colonel Bisbee.

700
00:47:22,739 --> 00:47:25,503
Aw, gee!
Thanks, Princess.

701
00:47:25,609 --> 00:47:27,975
You don't realize
what a great thrill this is.

702
00:47:28,045 --> 00:47:30,377
Of course, I don't know
what my dad did, but...

703
00:47:30,447 --> 00:47:34,110
You don't know he saved the
Princess's life during the war?

704
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:37,817
Heroes don't talk much,
do they, my dear?

705
00:47:37,888 --> 00:47:42,018
But in my country, the name
Samuel Bisbee is a household word.

706
00:47:45,095 --> 00:47:46,119
Mother!

707
00:47:46,496 --> 00:47:47,656
Mother!

708
00:47:48,265 --> 00:47:52,531
Quickly, get some water! Quick!
Won't somebody get some water?

709
00:47:52,603 --> 00:47:54,628
Look out, she may be stalling.

710
00:47:57,374 --> 00:48:00,537
There, there, Mother!
How are you feeling now?

711
00:48:01,478 --> 00:48:03,070
I'm all right.

712
00:48:05,048 --> 00:48:07,039
I'll get your husband.

713
00:48:08,318 --> 00:48:11,378
Colonel! Colonel Bisbee!

714
00:48:12,456 --> 00:48:13,787
Sam!

715
00:48:25,435 --> 00:48:28,598
Hello, Abigail, dear.
Did you miss me?

716
00:48:29,406 --> 00:48:31,101
Hello, Samuel.

717
00:48:31,909 --> 00:48:32,933
Your Highness,

718
00:48:33,010 --> 00:48:34,500
I know
it's an awful lot to ask,

719
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:36,205
but won't you come in?

720
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:37,542
I'd be delighted!

721
00:48:38,982 --> 00:48:40,347
Won't you all come in?

722
00:48:40,417 --> 00:48:41,975
Charmed, I assure you.

723
00:48:46,423 --> 00:48:48,755
It looks like a great day
for the Bisbee family.

724
00:48:48,825 --> 00:48:51,487
Thank you, Mayor. You haven't a
little dram on the hip, have you?

725
00:48:51,561 --> 00:48:54,553
Colonel, I always have
something on the hip.

726
00:49:10,881 --> 00:49:13,076
Mayor, you're okay.

727
00:49:13,150 --> 00:49:15,141
I voted for you
last election.

728
00:49:15,485 --> 00:49:16,611
Five times.

729
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,524
Your Highness, please.

730
00:49:31,601 --> 00:49:34,126
Before you make
any other engagements,

731
00:49:34,204 --> 00:49:35,933
I've invited some
of our best people

732
00:49:36,006 --> 00:49:37,439
to my home
to dinner tonight.

733
00:49:37,507 --> 00:49:39,498
I hope you'll enjoy
meeting them.

734
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:41,110
I'm so sorry,

735
00:49:41,178 --> 00:49:45,239
but you see, I'm dining with
the Bisbee family this evening.

736
00:49:47,718 --> 00:49:48,742
But Your Highness!

737
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:51,879
I've made all the preparations,
engaged the caterers.

738
00:49:51,955 --> 00:49:54,651
Why how fortunate!
You won't object, will you?

739
00:49:54,725 --> 00:49:55,953
Object?

740
00:49:56,026 --> 00:49:58,824
If Mrs. Murchison's caterers
served the dinner in your home?

741
00:49:58,895 --> 00:50:01,329
Then you could invite
all your friends.

742
00:50:01,398 --> 00:50:06,062
Well, of course I'd be delighted,
if it pleases Your Highness.

743
00:50:06,136 --> 00:50:08,366
It pleases me very much.

744
00:50:08,438 --> 00:50:10,269
And you're all invited.

745
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:12,365
Isn't she marvelous!
What an idea!

746
00:50:12,442 --> 00:50:14,808
I never would have
thought of it myself.

747
00:50:19,549 --> 00:50:22,177
I can't tell you how I
appreciate it, Mrs. Bisbee.

748
00:50:22,252 --> 00:50:24,277
What was that?
I beg your pardon.

749
00:50:24,354 --> 00:50:26,914
Allowing me to use
your lovely home for my party.

750
00:50:26,990 --> 00:50:29,925
Not at all. It's a pleasure.
Excuse me.

751
00:50:31,928 --> 00:50:34,761
How do you do, Mrs. Bisbee?
Good evening, Robert.

752
00:50:35,665 --> 00:50:37,792
Thank you, thank you,
gentlemen. Thank you.

753
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:39,495
Well, Samuel?

754
00:50:39,836 --> 00:50:42,930
Abigail, my dear,
the party's a big success.

755
00:50:43,006 --> 00:50:45,668
Don't be so stiff.
Relax! Relax!

756
00:50:45,742 --> 00:50:47,334
How can you
in this armor?

757
00:50:51,681 --> 00:50:53,046
Sam, you look marvelous.

758
00:50:53,116 --> 00:50:57,075
Oh, thanks, thanks, thanks.
Marie, you're a prince.

759
00:50:57,154 --> 00:51:00,885
Princess... Princess!
Oh, yeah, Princess.

760
00:51:01,491 --> 00:51:04,119
Your Highness,
won't you come in?

761
00:51:10,033 --> 00:51:12,593
Your Highness, may I
present Mr. Robert Murchison?

762
00:51:12,669 --> 00:51:15,194
How do you do?
Not Bob Murchison?

763
00:51:15,272 --> 00:51:16,261
Really!

764
00:51:16,339 --> 00:51:18,239
You're Pauline's fiancée,
are you not?

765
00:51:18,308 --> 00:51:19,673
Not yet, Your Highness,

766
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:21,643
but I still have hopes.
Well...

767
00:51:21,711 --> 00:51:24,077
And this is Mr. Phil
Cummings. How do you do?

768
00:51:24,147 --> 00:51:28,584
She's a darling! She's the
finest lady I ever met in my life.

769
00:51:28,652 --> 00:51:30,586
Except you
and your mother.

770
00:51:30,654 --> 00:51:32,246
Thanks, Dad.

771
00:51:32,322 --> 00:51:34,051
Don't drink
too much tonight.

772
00:51:34,224 --> 00:51:35,486
No, I won't.

773
00:51:37,427 --> 00:51:39,122
That's an idea.

774
00:52:04,054 --> 00:52:06,022
Won't you sit down,
Your Highness? Certainly.

775
00:52:06,089 --> 00:52:08,216
Come and sit with me.
Thank you.

776
00:52:12,929 --> 00:52:15,693
What a marvelous match
they will make.

777
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:17,990
Take off those spats!
Huh?

778
00:52:18,068 --> 00:52:19,330
And come right in here!

779
00:52:19,402 --> 00:52:22,462
Oh, yeah, I'll have them right
off in a minute. I'll be right in.

780
00:52:25,475 --> 00:52:27,466
Hey, you boys stick around.

781
00:52:27,544 --> 00:52:29,876
There's going to be
turkey and ice cream later.

782
00:52:29,946 --> 00:52:32,676
Samuel!
Yes, dear? Yes, dear?

783
00:52:34,618 --> 00:52:35,983
Yes, dear?

784
00:52:38,288 --> 00:52:40,950
Take that junk with you.
Yes, dear? Coming, dear.

785
00:52:41,024 --> 00:52:43,083
Your Highness, friends,

786
00:52:43,527 --> 00:52:45,586
I have a little
surprise for you.

787
00:52:45,662 --> 00:52:49,496
It gives me great pleasure to announce
the engagement of my son, Robert,

788
00:52:49,566 --> 00:52:51,466
to Miss Pauline Bisbee.

789
00:52:52,802 --> 00:52:55,635
Formal announcements
will follow by mail.

790
00:52:58,241 --> 00:53:01,267
Congratulations!
Congratulations!

791
00:53:06,917 --> 00:53:10,250
...be here, and everything.
I'm enjoying it.

792
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:12,581
Murchie,
you're a good scout.

793
00:53:12,656 --> 00:53:14,146
I'm beginning to like you. Oh?

794
00:53:14,224 --> 00:53:16,089
If you want a little
snort of gin later on,

795
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:17,751
I know where there's
some stashed away,

796
00:53:17,827 --> 00:53:19,089
out here in the closet...

797
00:53:19,162 --> 00:53:23,030
You play golf, of course, Your
Graceness? I mean, Your High Royalness.

798
00:53:23,099 --> 00:53:26,125
Yes, but very badly, I'm
afraid. How fortunate!

799
00:53:26,203 --> 00:53:28,228
We're opening our new
country club tomorrow.

800
00:53:28,305 --> 00:53:30,569
I'm going to ball off
the first tee.

801
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:32,164
If you really
want to please me,

802
00:53:32,242 --> 00:53:33,641
let me come and watch my dear friend,

803
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:35,109
Sam Bisbee,
open the new course.

804
00:53:35,178 --> 00:53:37,043
Sam Bisbee? Sam?

805
00:53:37,247 --> 00:53:39,215
It would
make me very happy.

806
00:53:39,282 --> 00:53:41,250
Anything
Your Highness desires.

807
00:53:41,318 --> 00:53:43,878
I'm afraid I can't do it.
I just hurt my foot.

808
00:53:43,954 --> 00:53:46,479
Will you make an announcement,
please? Certainly.

809
00:53:46,556 --> 00:53:47,921
Ladies and gentlemen!

810
00:53:47,991 --> 00:53:49,618
I wish to
announce the opening

811
00:53:49,693 --> 00:53:50,682
of our new course

812
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:52,853
tomorrow afternoon sharp.

813
00:53:52,929 --> 00:53:57,423
Our esteemed friend, Mr. Sam
Bisbee will kick off the first tee.

814
00:53:57,734 --> 00:54:00,760
I mean, will knock off the first green.

815
00:54:00,837 --> 00:54:04,295
Shall we all go in to
dinner, Your Honor? Delighted.

816
00:54:04,975 --> 00:54:08,001
His Honor has
a beautiful bun on.

817
00:54:08,078 --> 00:54:10,945
You know, I have
a set of golf clubs.

818
00:54:11,481 --> 00:54:13,210
They were left to me
by my grandfather.

819
00:54:13,283 --> 00:54:14,682
He was an inventor, too,
you know.

820
00:54:14,751 --> 00:54:17,720
That's fine, Sam.
You'll do all right.

821
00:54:17,821 --> 00:54:21,222
Marie, this princess stuff is
working like a million dollars.

822
00:54:21,291 --> 00:54:23,054
Keep it up! Keep it up!

823
00:54:25,395 --> 00:54:26,760
Fish eggs!

824
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:32,559
All right, folks.
Step this way.

825
00:54:32,636 --> 00:54:34,866
We're about to start
the festivities.

826
00:54:35,739 --> 00:54:37,673
I'm depending a lot upon you.

827
00:54:37,741 --> 00:54:40,539
I was never on a golf course
in my life before.

828
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:43,238
Don't worry.
Neither was I.

829
00:54:45,482 --> 00:54:47,040
I don't like
that boy's face.

830
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:48,880
Why, he's the best caddy
they have in the club.

831
00:54:48,952 --> 00:54:50,579
He don't know
from nothing.

832
00:54:50,654 --> 00:54:51,746
Well, pretend you know.

833
00:54:51,821 --> 00:54:53,584
Talk as though
you know all about it.

834
00:54:53,657 --> 00:54:55,750
Well, I'll do
the best I can.

835
00:54:56,359 --> 00:54:58,520
This is a happy day,
Mrs. Bisbee.

836
00:54:58,595 --> 00:55:00,119
Do you know,
I'm really quite worried.

837
00:55:00,196 --> 00:55:02,357
I don't believe he ever hit
a golf ball in his life.

838
00:55:02,432 --> 00:55:04,662
Don't worry, Mother.
He'll try anything once.

839
00:55:04,734 --> 00:55:07,362
Hey! Get out...
Hey!

840
00:55:15,412 --> 00:55:17,175
Mr. Bisbee!

841
00:55:17,647 --> 00:55:20,639
Ladies and gentlemen, as
Chairman of the Greens Committee,

842
00:55:20,717 --> 00:55:22,685
it gives me
great pleasure to announce

843
00:55:22,752 --> 00:55:26,552
that Mr. Sam Bisbee will knock
the first ball off the course.

844
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:33,558
I thank you
for your confidence.

845
00:55:44,107 --> 00:55:45,938
Going to be a great help,
that boy.

846
00:55:46,009 --> 00:55:48,876
I haven't played since playing in
the Thousand Islands, years ago.

847
00:55:48,945 --> 00:55:51,778
What are you doing? Stop
that! Stop it! Stand still.

848
00:55:51,848 --> 00:55:55,079
Put it... Put the bag down.
Go! What are you doing?

849
00:55:56,619 --> 00:55:59,986
I haven't played since playing in
the Thousand Islands, many years ago.

850
00:56:00,056 --> 00:56:02,047
I used to be in the dressing
business up there.

851
00:56:02,125 --> 00:56:03,786
In the early days
in the Thousand Islands,

852
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:07,159
we used to tee off on one
island and drive to the other.

853
00:56:07,230 --> 00:56:08,959
How far is it from
one island to the other?

854
00:56:09,032 --> 00:56:10,294
About a mile.

855
00:56:10,367 --> 00:56:12,892
Really?
You could drive a mile?

856
00:56:12,969 --> 00:56:15,028
We used to putt
a quarter of a mile.

857
00:56:16,373 --> 00:56:19,274
Of course, we had to
have the wind behind us.

858
00:56:20,243 --> 00:56:23,576
Little too much whip
in that club, nimrod.

859
00:56:24,514 --> 00:56:26,778
Now stand clear, boy,
and keep your eye on the ball.

860
00:56:26,850 --> 00:56:29,375
By the way, did you
bring a ball with you?

861
00:56:29,753 --> 00:56:31,448
Wonderful!

862
00:56:31,688 --> 00:56:33,280
Now, stand...

863
00:56:34,023 --> 00:56:36,287
You don't play golf
with these things.

864
00:56:37,127 --> 00:56:41,564
There's a marvelous club.
Bought that club in Europe.

865
00:56:42,198 --> 00:56:43,722
Where's that club
I bought in India?

866
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:45,028
Let me see
that Indian club...

867
00:56:45,101 --> 00:56:46,090
Never mind.
Wait a minute.

868
00:56:46,169 --> 00:56:47,830
I bought a wonderful club
in Toronto.

869
00:56:47,904 --> 00:56:50,873
Did you? Yeah, give
me that Canadian club.

870
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:53,966
This is a very remarkable
piece of wood...

871
00:56:54,043 --> 00:56:57,740
I told you to hide that
and not let anyone see it...

872
00:57:00,984 --> 00:57:03,009
You know
I never use tobacco.

873
00:57:04,254 --> 00:57:05,653
That's no good.

874
00:57:07,023 --> 00:57:10,481
Now, stand clear, boy,
and keep your eye on the ball.

875
00:57:13,797 --> 00:57:16,357
Ah, just as I thought.
It's warped.

876
00:57:16,933 --> 00:57:18,730
Try this putting niblick.

877
00:57:18,935 --> 00:57:19,924
Putting niblick?

878
00:57:20,303 --> 00:57:22,134
A putting niblick!

879
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:26,102
Oh, that's much better.
Ah, that's much better.

880
00:57:26,176 --> 00:57:29,270
Now, stand clear, boy,
and keep your eye on the ball.

881
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:45,518
Stand clear!

882
00:58:15,191 --> 00:58:16,488
Stop it!

883
00:58:16,726 --> 00:58:19,354
Now, you stand clear and
keep your eye on this ball.

884
00:58:20,230 --> 00:58:22,289
Sorry to have
lost my temper.

885
00:58:23,967 --> 00:58:25,491
Stand clear!

886
00:58:54,130 --> 00:58:55,893
Quite a breeze!

887
00:59:25,328 --> 00:59:27,193
You stand still, will you?

888
00:59:27,497 --> 00:59:29,021
Maybe this'll help a bit.

889
00:59:30,266 --> 00:59:33,099
Stand still and keep
your eye on this ball.

890
00:59:34,037 --> 00:59:36,597
I never should have had
a caddy in the first place.

891
00:59:37,807 --> 00:59:40,298
Go on and hit it, Sam.
They're all watching you.

892
00:59:40,376 --> 00:59:42,276
Well, I know,
but this chap keeps...

893
00:59:45,114 --> 00:59:47,981
Stay still if I have
to choke you to death!

894
00:59:49,819 --> 00:59:52,947
Awfully sorry I keep
losing my temper...

895
00:59:55,325 --> 00:59:56,883
Godfrey Daniel!

896
01:00:04,467 --> 01:00:07,402
It's chocolate custard.
I'm dripping.

897
01:00:13,743 --> 01:00:16,871
I was a fool to ever
bring a caddy with me.

898
01:00:18,948 --> 01:00:21,746
Go away! Go away!

899
01:00:32,528 --> 01:00:34,723
Look at that thing!

900
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:39,627
Got the pie on there, yeah.

901
01:00:41,337 --> 01:00:43,305
Put your foot on that.

902
01:00:46,943 --> 01:00:50,106
Now stand clear and keep
your eye on the ball.

903
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:53,210
Look at that thing.
It's still going that way.

904
01:00:53,282 --> 01:00:55,842
I was a fool for
ever having a caddy.

905
01:01:02,492 --> 01:01:04,722
Hope they can't see this.

906
01:01:04,894 --> 01:01:06,725
Come on, go away.

907
01:01:25,748 --> 01:01:27,648
You know, when you first
suggested the caddy I...

908
01:01:27,717 --> 01:01:29,309
I was against it
right from the start.

909
01:01:29,385 --> 01:01:31,649
I wanted to carry
the clubs myself.

910
01:01:34,090 --> 01:01:35,648
But of course when you...

911
01:01:35,925 --> 01:01:37,586
Don't get
too annoyed, Sam.

912
01:01:37,660 --> 01:01:39,753
I'm not annoyed,
only...

913
01:01:39,996 --> 01:01:43,295
I look like... I look
like a fool out here.

914
01:01:43,366 --> 01:01:45,527
All these people,
they're...

915
01:01:49,806 --> 01:01:52,775
You stand clear and keep
your eye on this ball.

916
01:01:52,842 --> 01:01:54,867
I think I'll hit it now.

917
01:01:59,615 --> 01:02:01,810
You see? Sorry...

918
01:02:03,986 --> 01:02:07,012
There it goes again.
Come on.

919
01:02:13,429 --> 01:02:15,363
There's your pie!

920
01:02:18,201 --> 01:02:21,329
You stand clear and keep
your eye on this ball!

921
01:02:29,245 --> 01:02:30,678
Take that!

922
01:02:34,183 --> 01:02:36,981
I hope you lose your nail.

923
01:02:37,487 --> 01:02:41,321
I really don't. I'm only fooling,
pretending I do, you know.

924
01:02:47,096 --> 01:02:51,499
That's strange. It was
around here just a minute ago.

925
01:02:53,069 --> 01:02:54,934
There it is.
Huh?

926
01:02:55,204 --> 01:02:56,535
There.
Where?

927
01:02:56,606 --> 01:02:57,834
There.
Huh?

928
01:02:57,907 --> 01:02:59,431
On the end of your club,
Sam.

929
01:02:59,509 --> 01:03:02,535
So it is, so it is!

930
01:03:02,612 --> 01:03:05,274
What a dunce I feel like. Oh!

931
01:03:05,915 --> 01:03:07,780
Stop that, will you!

932
01:03:09,218 --> 01:03:11,209
You stand clear and keep
your eye on this ball!

933
01:03:11,954 --> 01:03:15,014
Excuse me, please. Excuse
me, please. Excuse me, please.

934
01:03:15,224 --> 01:03:17,419
Is that Mr. Bisbee?
Yes, Sam Bisbee.

935
01:03:17,493 --> 01:03:18,983
Oh, thanks.

936
01:03:19,362 --> 01:03:22,627
Stand clear, boy,
and keep your eye on the ball.

937
01:03:23,132 --> 01:03:25,930
Mr. Bisbee! Robbins,
National Tire Company.

938
01:03:26,002 --> 01:03:28,300
Yeah, glad to see you again,
Mr. Robbins.

939
01:03:28,371 --> 01:03:30,305
We found your car,
tested your tires.

940
01:03:30,373 --> 01:03:32,705
I'm prepared to make you a
reasonable offer for your invention.

941
01:03:32,775 --> 01:03:35,243
How much?
$20,000.

942
01:03:35,311 --> 01:03:37,677
Just a moment, Sam. Is that
for your puncture-proof tire?

943
01:03:37,747 --> 01:03:38,941
Yes, it is.
Ridiculous!

944
01:03:39,015 --> 01:03:41,245
I'm prepared to offer
$50,000 for the patent.

945
01:03:41,317 --> 01:03:42,841
I beg pardon.
And who are you?

946
01:03:42,919 --> 01:03:44,181
I'm the Princess Lescaboura,

947
01:03:44,253 --> 01:03:45,618
and I want the rights
for my country.

948
01:03:45,688 --> 01:03:46,985
Well, I won't haggle.

949
01:03:47,056 --> 01:03:48,045
$75,000!

950
01:03:48,124 --> 01:03:49,113
$90,000!

951
01:03:49,192 --> 01:03:51,717
$150,000!
$300,000.

952
01:03:51,794 --> 01:03:53,887
$400,000!
$500,000!

953
01:03:53,963 --> 01:03:57,023
$600,000!
$750,000!

954
01:03:57,099 --> 01:03:59,033
I'll give you
a million dollars

955
01:03:59,101 --> 01:04:01,160
and a royalty on
every tire manufactured!

956
01:04:01,237 --> 01:04:03,569
Sold to the gentleman
with the Panama hat!

957
01:04:04,740 --> 01:04:08,301
Here's a check
for $50,000. $50,000!

958
01:04:10,513 --> 01:04:13,744
You take this check!
Grab this check! Here!

959
01:04:13,816 --> 01:04:15,181
Sam!

960
01:04:16,886 --> 01:04:18,376
Goodbye, my bun.

961
01:04:21,390 --> 01:04:23,255
Goodbye, Mr. Bisbee.
Goodbye, Mrs. Murchison.

962
01:04:23,326 --> 01:04:25,521
Goodbye, Bisbee.
Goodbye, Murchie.

963
01:04:25,595 --> 01:04:28,291
Goodbye, Sam.
Goodbye, Marie.

964
01:04:28,364 --> 01:04:30,059
I want to thank you
for a lot of fun.

965
01:04:30,132 --> 01:04:31,599
The pleasure's mutual.

966
01:04:32,368 --> 01:04:35,599
We certainly put that
princess stuff over, didn't we?

967
01:04:35,671 --> 01:04:37,468
You're telling me!

968
01:04:38,541 --> 01:04:40,372
Goodbye, Sam.
Goodbye, Marie.

969
01:04:40,443 --> 01:04:42,638
Goodbye! Goodbye, Sam. Goodbye now...

970
01:04:42,712 --> 01:04:44,373
Don't forget...
Bye, Peter.

971
01:04:44,447 --> 01:04:46,711
Goodbye!
Don't forget to...

972
01:04:46,782 --> 01:04:49,683
Don't... Don't forget to send
me a postcard from Niagara Falls!

973
01:04:49,752 --> 01:04:53,051
Boys, we're off to the races.
Take that.

974
01:04:57,360 --> 01:04:59,760
Now, if anybody wants me
for the next two weeks,

975
01:04:59,829 --> 01:05:01,729
I'll be in conference.

976
01:05:03,532 --> 01:05:05,591
Right about face!

977
01:05:06,769 --> 01:05:09,237
Forward march!

978
01:05:10,139 --> 01:05:11,731
What a relief!

979
01:05:15,811 --> 01:05:17,403
They've gone.

980
01:05:18,147 --> 01:05:20,115
Charlie, open that bag.

981
01:05:22,585 --> 01:05:25,986
This'll be the first real
drink I've had in months.
