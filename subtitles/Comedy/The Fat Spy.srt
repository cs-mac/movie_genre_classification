1
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:11,520
Good, please show more intimacy.

2
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:32,120
<i>Comrade Major! Something big happened!</i>

3
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:35,820
<i>The North seems to know that Comrade
Han Myeong Wol wants to surrender.</i>

4
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:54,420
<i>It seems as if they've already sent a sniper.</i>

5
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,020
No... no...

6
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:20,320
Hyeong!
(Hyeong - older brother)

7
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,420
Gang U hyeong!

8
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:41,020
What's going on?

9
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:42,420
It's no big deal.

10
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:43,820
It's just acute appendicitis, appendicitis!

11
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:46,120
So then, he's in surgery now?

12
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:46,620
But what about the wedding?

13
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:49,420
The wedding has been postponed.

14
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:50,320
Postponed until when?

15
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,020
Can't you elaborate?

16
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:53,720
Sorry, let's stop it here.

17
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,620
I will contact you guys with
more detailed information.

18
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:58,720
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

19
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,620
Tell a bit more, please tell a bit more!

20
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,420
Hello?

21
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:04,720
Yes, Representative.

22
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:06,620
How is it over there?

23
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:09,620
It's a mess, there are reporters everywhere!

24
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:13,820
Yes. I've said it according to the
instructions of the representatives.

25
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:16,420
So what does this matter count as?

26
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:53,220
Myeong Wol, don't wait here

27
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:55,620
go and change your clothes.

28
00:03:55,620 --> 00:04:00,620
You sitting here won't change a thing.

29
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:07,220
Comrade Major, what happened
to Comrade Myeong Wol?

30
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,020
She's all right.

31
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,120
That's fortunate.

32
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,620
Really fortunate...

33
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,520
I thought something had happened.

34
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,720
We can't even go there,
we can only wait here...

35
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:19,620
But...

36
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:22,020
Gang U was shot.

37
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:23,520
What?

38
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,620
So, the wedding was cancelled.

39
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:29,920
No... how could Gang U...

40
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:34,920
It seems like Gang U took the bullet
meant for Comrade Myeong Wol.

41
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:44,320
So, it really was a sniper.

42
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,720
I guess so.

43
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:50,120
What should we do... what should we do?

44
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:54,120
Well, how's Comrade Gang U's condition?

45
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:58,120
Although it's unclear,
his condition isn't very good.

46
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,120
What should we do?

47
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,720
What are we going to do,
Comrade Myeong Wol?

48
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:05,820
But,

49
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:10,420
if the reason why they sent a sniper was because
they knew Comrade Myeong Wol was going to surrender,

50
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:13,220
then the matter won't be easy to settle.

51
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:14,620
Yes,

52
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:18,520
they definitely want to kill
Comrade Myeong Wol.

53
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:24,320
So, is that why you came back?

54
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:27,020
And even giving up the chance
to go back to the North?

55
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:32,320
First, help me look into where
Gang U's hospital and ward is.

56
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:34,420
That's it, then.

57
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:44,620
Can't you see that he will not leave because
Comrade Myeong Wol is in serious danger?

58
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:51,020
When we look at it this way,
Comrade Major is also pitiful.

59
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:55,720
But no matter what he does,
Gang U is all that Myeong Wol sees.

60
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,020
That's true.

61
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,320
<i>No...</i>

62
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:40,620
So, you didn't go to Gang U's wedding?

63
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,120
Why would I go?

64
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,220
I don't want to go and
give them my blessing.

65
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,720
They also would prefer if I didn't go.

66
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:53,820
Good thinking.

67
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,020
Then, what about you, Grandfather?

68
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:59,020
Why would I want to attend their wedding?

69
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:03,020
Besides, there will probably be a lot of people
congratulating them.

70
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:05,420
I've already paid my respects
by sending a gift.

71
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:08,320
By the sound of it,
you've sent them some money.

72
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:11,120
You hate him so much. Why would you...

73
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:15,320
Even if it's for 'face' sake,
I can't bring myself to do that.

74
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:18,720
That's why I say that you're still immature.

75
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,220
What good will putting up a strong front do you?

76
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:23,020
Oh, whatever! Think whatever you like.

77
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:28,220
You...have you already given up on Gang U?

78
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:31,020
How can I not give up?

79
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:34,620
I'm also tired.

80
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:37,520
Oh, how is it?
Have you sent over the money?

81
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:40,020
The wedding was cancelled.

82
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:40,720
What?

83
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,820
What happened?

84
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:45,420
Gang U suddenly needed appendicitis surgery.

85
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:49,620
But from the rumors,
it may have been due to a gunshot.

86
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:50,620
Gunshot?

87
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:52,020
How is that possible?

88
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:53,620
Who would want to kill Gang U?

89
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,520
So, how is Gang U right now?

90
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:59,620
It seems to be more serious than I thought.

91
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:07,520
Really? Who could want to get rid of Gang U?

92
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:10,920
Moreover, with a gunshot at that.

93
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:13,220
And also...

94
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:16,220
it seems that Mr. Choe may not have
left the country yet.

95
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:18,920
What? He hasn't left the country?

96
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:23,220
Yes, his name was not found
on the final boarding list.

97
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,420
Then, could it have been...

98
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:28,120
Choe Ryu who did that to Gang U?

99
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,020
If it were not, then why?

100
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:34,920
We must observe Choe Ryu's movements.

101
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:38,220
If anything seem suspicious,
contact me immediately.

102
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,420
Yes.

103
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:52,320
What does he mean? Why would
Choe Ryu do that to Gang U?

104
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:58,920
<i>Please help me get an identity that can safely
get me back to the North and airline tickets too.</i>

105
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,620
Going to the North seems rather strange.

106
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:05,920
Oh! It can't be that...

107
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:12,320
No way! It's not possible.
That's too ridiculous!

108
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:20,420
Ah, Doctor, how is he? Hyeong's okay, right?

109
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,420
We've already removed the bullet and
stitched up the wound as well.

110
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:31,420
Fortunately, the bullet missed a vital organ,
avoiding serious consequences.

111
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:34,620
Ah, Thank you! Thank you!

112
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:39,220
However, there was excessive bleeding
while making his way here.

113
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:42,020
So till now, he has yet to regain consciousness.

114
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:48,120
What?
Then... that... when would that be?

115
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:52,120
It's hard to tell.
There's no way for us to know.

116
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:11,120
We're fortunate enough as it is.
So, don't be too worried.

117
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,420
Gang U hyeong, will definitely wake up soon.

118
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:15,520
Yes...

119
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,920
But seriously, this situation is very strange.

120
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,220
How can he get shot in the center of Seoul?

121
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:24,520
We don't even know who did this, either.

122
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:28,420
Myeong Wol, perhaps, is there anyone
that you might suspect?

123
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:33,920
Could Hyeong, perhaps, have been
receiving threats all this while?

124
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:39,620
It couldn't be a repeat of the incident
at the Minera Hotel previously, right?

125
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:43,820
Or could it be someone like a
crazy, perverted stalker?

126
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:47,420
If I ever find out who that crazy guy is,
he'll have to deal with me!

127
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


128
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,720
Oppa!
(Oppa - older brother, boyfriend)

129
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,020
Gyeong Ju.

130
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:55,420
Is Gang U oppa, okay?

131
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:57,620
Hey, what are you doing here?

132
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:02,020
I heard that Gang U oppa had surgery,
How could I not come and see how he is?

133
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:06,920
He's fine, so don't disturb the patient.
Let's talk outside...talk outside.

134
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,020
What's wrong with you?

135
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:09,820
Let's talk outside!

136
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,620
<i>We don't even know who did this, either.</i>

137
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:21,920
<i>Myeong Wol, perhaps, is that anyone
that you might suspect?</i>

138
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,120
<i>What are you going to do?</i>

139
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,820
<i>Didn't I say before,</i>

140
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:31,520
<i>that if we fail, we can't allow Gang U who knows
our identities to continue living any longer.</i>

141
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:36,620
No. That's impossible.

142
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:41,320
It's not possible that he'd be there
at that time.

143
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,220
Gyeong Ju.

144
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:45,720
Aigoo!
(Aigoo - oh dear, oh my god)

145
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,720
Oppa, just what are you doing?

146
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,820
Oppa, you'd better come clean.

147
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:51,720
Aigoo... what about?

148
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,820
You're hiding something, aren't you? Right?

149
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:57,320
Aigoo, what can I be hiding?

150
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,520
Then why are you stuttering?

151
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:02,120
St...st...stuttering, who's stuttering?

152
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:05,820
Look, aren't you stuttering right now?

153
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:08,520
Then look at me and say it again.

154
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


155
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:20,320
You see? Oppa, do you have a
secret that you're not telling me?

156
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,220
So, this is the sort of relationship that we're in?

157
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,920
It's not like that, Gyeong Ju.

158
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:28,520
I'm really disappointed. Let's break up.

159
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:31,320
What? Gyeong Ju!

160
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,220
Oh, it shouldn't be like this.

161
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:35,420
Hey, Gyeong Ju, Gyeong Ju.

162
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,520
Comrade Ok Sun, right now,
what are your plans for the future?

163
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,120
Ah...
Who knows?

164
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:51,220
Since I've decided to stay, either I surrender,
or I'll just remain as I have, like before.

165
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:55,320
I have to make a choice between the two.

166
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,120
How about you, Comrade Hui Bok?

167
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:02,220
Isn't surrendering a better choice?

168
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:05,620
Then let's do that.
At least we can live more peacefully.

169
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:07,920
But if we did that,

170
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,020
just like Comrade Myeong Wol,
the higher-ups may not let us go.

171
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:14,620
Because Comrade Myeong Wol became
an actress here...

172
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:17,120
so if she surrendered,
it would have resulted into a huge issue.

173
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:21,120
For small fries like us,
why would they bother?

174
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,320
Well, you can never be too sure.

175
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:27,120
In that case, let's just carry on like this.

176
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,020
That's also too precarious.

177
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,120
All I really want is to be able to
sleep without a worry.

178
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,920
The, let's just surrender.

179
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:40,120
If I did that, I don't think I can
sleep in peace either.

180
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,920
Then, what do you really want?

181
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:45,120
This is really annoying.

182
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,920
Whenever a decision has to be made,
why must you make it so difficult?

183
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:55,520
You don't have to worry.
Let me settle it for you.

184
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,820
How?

185
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:58,620
I just have to report you to the authorities.

186
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:00,920
What?

187
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,620
Is this 113?

188
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,820
Don't do that! Seriously...

189
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:21,420
I'm sorry, but you can't visit him right now.

190
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,820
I came to see you.

191
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:36,820
I hope that you can be honest with me.

192
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:40,420
What can I tell you?

193
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:45,020
Just who are you and Choe?

194
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:49,720
What do you guys do? Why is Grandfather
and Gang U both caught up like that?

195
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:53,920
And Choe said...

196
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:02,920
that he's returning to North Korea.
What's that about?

197
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:09,020
Don't try to tell me that you don't know.
I know enough to know that it involves you.

198
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:13,220
There is something, isn't there?
Something that you can't reveal?

199
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:19,020
If it's about this,
why don't you ask Chairman Ju?

200
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:24,420
Then do you know where Choe is. right now?

201
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:26,920
I heard he didn't leave the country yet.

202
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,720
What?

203
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,020
There's no way that

204
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:38,320
Gang U's injury...
has anything to do with Choe, right?

205
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:55,720
It can't be... it's not possible!

206
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:10,020
How could it be? How could it?

207
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,220
Just make your way back, then I'll spare you.

208
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:49,520
I'm only trying to complete my mission.

209
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,820
Didn't you get what I just said?

210
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:58,220
Send a message back.
Han Myeong Wol's problem will be sorted out by me.

211
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:00,420
Immediately stop the order to terminate.

212
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:04,220
You should know well enough that not following
through our orders has serious repurcussions.

213
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:07,220
If you don't want to die, do as I say.

214
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,920
Oh, what's this?

215
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:51,020
What do I do? What do I do?

216
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,220
Don't worry, I'm fine.

217
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:56,920
Hey, how can you be fine?
You're still bleeding!

218
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:59,420
Oh, give me a sec...

219
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,720
This... use it to tie that up.

220
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,520
Thank you.

221
00:19:07,595 --> 00:19:11,720
Oh...
That was rather expensive.

222
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:16,020
On my last trip to Italy,
I bought that direct from the designer.

223
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:16,920
In that case...

224
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:19,920
Oh, never mind! It's already dirty!

225
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:26,720
But...how did you get hurt?

226
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:31,520
That wound of yours...
is it from a knife?

227
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:36,020
No, it's not. It's just a scratch.

228
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:39,420
<i>It's only a scratch?</i>

229
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:44,020
<i>Could he possibly be a spy?</i>

230
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:54,120
<i>That's not possible! He's so naive.</i>

231
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:57,820
<i>But if it should be the case, then...</i>

232
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:02,120
<i>Since you've already uncovered my identity,
I can't let you live!

233
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:04,820
Oh!

234
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:15,520
It's nothing, just wait for me here.
I'm going to the drugstore to get some medicine.

235
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:25,820
That's not right, it's too strange. That's right.

236
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


237
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:44,820
Aren't you Miss Ju In A?

238
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:50,320
No, I'm not! Oh, what should I do?

239
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:55,220
Also...do I have any proof?

240
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:00,120
That...
Oh!

241
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:43,220
Comrade Han Myeong Wol.

242
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,120
Why are you doing this?

243
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:53,320
I'm asking you why you're doing this?

244
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,220
Comrade Han Myeong Wol!

245
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:04,820
I begged you not to touch Comrade Gang U.

246
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:07,020
Have you already forgotten?

247
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:10,620
I'm warning you.

248
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:13,520
If you should touch Gang U again...

249
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,420
I won't let you off.

250
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:18,220
And I won't stop myself.

251
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:24,520
What goodwill I have left for Comrade Major...

252
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,620
ends here.

253
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:33,220
From today,
I will hate you for the rest of my life.

254
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:57,420
In A.

255
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:58,920
Where are you going to?

256
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,320
You can't be...

257
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,020
doing something useless like last time, right?

258
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,620
Grandfather.

259
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:19,220
Since you brought it up, let me ask.

260
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:23,220
Choe Ryu, who exactly is that man?

261
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,020
What's his relationship with Grandfather?

262
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:29,320
What exactly does he do?

263
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,420
It's better that you don't know.

264
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:32,720
Don't involve yourself.

265
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,820
Really, Grandfather, you keep saying that!

266
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:37,420
It keeps bugging me,
so how can I just leave it?

267
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:41,320
Are you, instead of Gang U...

268
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:44,320
starting to have feelings for that guy, Choe Ryu?

269
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,420
What?

270
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:48,120
Do you think I'm crazy?

271
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:50,820
If you don't have feelings, then it's fine.

272
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,220
I thought it might be possible, so I asked.

273
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,320
You should never get close to that guy.

274
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:58,220
When you're compassionate,

275
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:59,420
you can't make clear judgment.

276
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:01,120
If you repeat what you did the last time,

277
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:04,020
this time round,
you'll definitely not be forgiven.

278
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:05,320
Then why?

279
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,620
Why can't I get close to him?

280
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:09,720
Why can't it be like that?

281
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:12,920
Grandfather, why don't you just tell me?

282
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:15,120
You'll find out later.

283
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,820
You people are so annoying!

284
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:21,020
This brat, really.

285
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:25,420
How did it go?

286
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:27,520
Do you have the results for the Four Joint Books?

287
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,320
Yes.

288
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,620
Really? Okay.

289
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:32,420
So what's this map pointing to?

290
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:35,220
About the...results of the analysis...

291
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:36,320
What about the results?

292
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,220
Before,

293
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:39,220
they said it was located somewhere
in the Korean Peninsula.

294
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:40,020
That's right.

295
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:42,020
Now, the results according to the expert...

296
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,920
is pointing to a completely different location.

297
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:44,820
What?

298
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:48,120
So, we referred it to the previous expert
from before...

299
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,920
and he said there was something with them.

300
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:52,820
What? Choe Ryu, that guy!

301
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:54,020
Chairman!

302
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,820
It's fine. Alright...

303
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:04,020
That guy! He must have altered them somehow.

304
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,120
He has destroyed the Four Joint Books!

305
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,620
Then...

306
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:10,420
He surely, surely...

307
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:14,020
must have had a copy
before destroying them.

308
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,420
In order to capture him...

309
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:18,220
there's no other way.

310
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,420
Call the NSA.
(NSA - National Security Association)

311
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:23,520
Yes.

312
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,120
This guy...

313
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:28,320
if he should see Han Myeong Wol in a hitch,

314
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:31,320
would he ignore the situation?

315
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:42,620
We shouldn't be seen casually in
a crowded place like this.

316
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:46,020
Then what about Comrade Myeong Wol,
who's probably not able to have a decent meal...

317
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:47,420
do we just ignore her situation?

318
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:49,820
After all, she's still our daughter!

319
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


320
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:54,020
But doesn't Gang U already know our situation?

321
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


322
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:55,720
How can we still meet?

323
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,820
He hasn't even regained consciousness yet.

324
00:25:57,820 --> 00:26:01,020
Why don't we just pop by to see
Comrade Myeong Wol for a moment?

325
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:05,520
Just now...

326
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:08,720
I think I didn't shut off the gas.

327
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,320
I have to attend to the gas...

328
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:15,120
Aigoo, seriously...!

329
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:18,020
That guy is so timid.

330
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:32,020
Just recently, there's an actor Gang U,
who was admitted here.

331
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


332
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:33,420
Which room is he in?

333
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:55,720
<i>I'm warning you.</i>

334
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:58,920
<i>If you touch Gang U again.</i>

335
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:03,120
<i>I won't let you off.</i>

336
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,320
Yes.

337
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:42,520
What?

338
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:50,620
<i>Until when do you plan to lie down like that?</i>

339
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:56,720
<i>The self-righteous, unlucky, and demanding you.

340
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


341
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:59,620
<i>Do you plan to just lie down there powerlessly?</i>

342
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,620
<i>Hey, hurry up and bring them over here!</i>

343
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:07,220
<i>Can't you do anything right?</i>

344
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:09,720
<i>What have you been doing as my bodyguard?</i>

345
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:13,320
<i>Yes, enough. Leave.</i>

346
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:17,120
<i>And if you attempt anything like this again,
I don't care if you're my bodyguard or not...</i>

347
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


348
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:22,120
<i>Are you a grasshopper?</i>

349
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:23,620
<i>Forget it.</i>

350
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,320
<i>If it isn't prepared by the best nutritionist...</i>

351
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:29,120
<i>incorporating the six main food nutrients.</i>

352
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,220
<i>I will not eat it.</i>

353
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,120
Are you all right?

354
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:59,620
Yes.

355
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:04,120
Is Comrade Gang U still the same?

356
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,220
He'll wake up soon.

357
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:12,020
That's right. He should get better.

358
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:15,620
I'm sorry.

359
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:19,320
In making a personal choice...

360
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:22,820
I can understand you.

361
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:27,520
In the past, I was also caught
between my mission and love.

362
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,820
I've gone through that distressing experience.

363
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,520
I really don't know...

364
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:36,820
how to face the both of you.

365
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:39,820
We both, too...

366
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:43,620
have decided to follow our own choices.

367
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:48,120
Comrade Major has also allowed us to do so.

368
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:52,120
He is unable to protect us anymore.

369
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:55,520
Let's find our own way out of this.

370
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:02,820
Besides that, has there been anything else?

371
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:04,620
What?

372
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:10,420
Has anyone been threatening
or attacking you?

373
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:13,320
That... what do you mean?

374
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:15,420
It seems that you're not aware...

375
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:19,720
The injury that Comrade Gang U sustained,
was actually...

376
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,820
directed at Comrade Myeong Wol.

377
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:25,320
Didn't Comrade Major tell you?

378
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:27,020
What?

379
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:29,020
The North found out that you were going to surrender.

380
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:30,620
So, they sent some people over.

381
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:34,020
After Comrade Major knew,

382
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:37,520
he turned back, while making his way to the North.

383
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:40,920
Is that the truth?

384
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:43,720
Yes. Since nothing else has happened...

385
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,320
we're really fortunate.

386
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:48,320
In short, pay attention to your safety.

387
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,520
Do you understand?

388
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:53,020
Comrade Hui Bok is still waiting for me.

389
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:54,820
I need to leave now.

390
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:07,420
<i>Comrade Han Myeong Wol. Why are you doing this?</i>

391
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:15,120
Is there a guardian named Han Myeong Wol?

392
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:18,020
She's over there.

393
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:23,820
Han Myeong Wol! Stay still!

394
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:26,020
Stop!

395
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,020
Han Myeong Wol!

396
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,820
Myeong Wol?

397
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:45,820
Why are you asking about Myeong Wol?

398
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:47,820
We need to investigate a few matters.

399
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:49,120
Investigate?

400
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:53,420
You just need to answer truthfully
on matters pertaining to Han Myeong Wol.

401
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:59,020
It seems that Chairman Ju has already
reported us to the police.

402
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:03,820
If that's so, the public will soon know.

403
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:09,720
Even if you surrender,
you won't be able to live here in peace.

404
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,920
North Korea won't let you off either.

405
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:21,020
The point is, everyone now knows who you are.

406
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,620
Are you okay?

407
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:32,420
I'm sorry.

408
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:38,620
I've misunderstood Comrade Major.

409
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:43,420
About that...

410
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:46,120
Right now, you should be taking care
of yourself.

411
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,920
Let's go to the detective agency first.

412
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:51,320
Although it's not necessarily safe there,

413
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:54,220
but it'll do until a safer place can be found.

414
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:23,320
No.

415
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:29,420
Hyeong, are you awake? You're awake!

416
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,120
Nurse!

417
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:32,820
What exactly happened?

418
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:35,220
Hyeong, you got shot!
Don't you remember?

419
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:36,520
Where is Myeong Wol?

420
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:37,620
What?

421
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:38,820
Myeong Wol.

422
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:42,320
She was just here.
She'll be back soon.

423
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,220
Myeong Wol is fine, isn't she?

424
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:47,620
Why are you worried about someone else,
when you're the one that's hurt!

425
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:55,020
What? Who could have reported it to the police?

426
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:59,720
What happened...it was obvious that
they were there to catch spies.

427
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:03,920
Then, what's going to happen to Myeong Wol?

428
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:06,520
Gang U is still lying there, injured.

429
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:09,020
Myeong Wol is in trouble.

430
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:11,420
Right now, we don't even know what will happen.

431
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:19,220
That's why I'm saying,
we have to come to a decision.

432
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:21,520
Have you finally decided?

433
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,820
What do you think of this...

434
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:28,220
I have a very good plan.

435
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:29,320
What?

436
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:35,020
Between the two of us, one of us will surrender.

437
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:37,220
while the other who reports it to the police,

438
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:41,320
will receive the grant and reward.

439
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,620
What?

440
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:44,520
Think about it.

441
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:51,020
The grant and reward could
amount to 5 million Won.

442
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:54,820
One of us just needs to go in
and endure a little hardship.

443
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:58,320
Once out, we'll can start a new life together.

444
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,020
Isn't that a good plan?

445
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:04,820
But wouldn't someone have to go to prison?

446
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:09,420
I've thought about that, too.

447
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:15,320
In this day and age, it's very difficult for
a woman to make it on her own.

448
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:23,520
So Comrade Ok Sun, why don't you settle
for some nutritious prison meals for awhile.

449
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:27,420
Since they're so nutritious, Comrade Hui Bok,
why don't you go for them instead?

450
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:30,620
Didn't I say that I was allergic to beans?
(beans and jail food have the same first syllable)

451
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:34,120
I'll take good care of the money.

452
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:37,120
How can I trust you?
What happens if you run away with the money?

453
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:38,520
What sort of person do you take me for?

454
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:41,020
What sort? How about the sort who would
run away with the money?

455
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:42,220
What?

456
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,220
Comrade Myeong Wol.

457
00:35:47,022 --> 00:35:52,220
Aigoo! We were really worried about you.
Right now, what should we do?

458
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:55,920
I mean, how did the situation get this bad?

459
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:59,620
I have to trouble you both in the mean time.

460
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:03,320
Until I find a place for her to stay,
please let her stay here.

461
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:07,020
What trouble? It's the least we could do.

462
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:10,420
I guess it's the best solution.

463
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:15,320
If we're all together, should we end up getting...

464
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,620
I can't believe this person...

465
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:18,920
We're actually her parents in name.

466
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:22,720
It's because we're her parents,
if we're found to be together...

467
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:25,820
Comrade Myeong Wol, just ignore him.

468
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:28,720
Please stay here with ease.

469
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:41,720
Yes, it's me.

470
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:45,420
<i>By the sound of it, you seem fine.</i>

471
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,520
<i>Is Han Myeong Wol okay, as well?</i>

472
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,720
Thanks to you.

473
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:52,820
That's why, you shouldn't have messed
around with the Four Joint Books!

474
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:54,620
So is that why you did that?

475
00:36:54,620 --> 00:37:00,520
<i>There's absolutely no way you'll be allowed
to take them to the North. So don't even try.</i>

476
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:07,220
However, if we get arrested,
then Chairman, you'll also be at the losing end.

477
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,520
What?

478
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:12,920
Don't you want to know the secret
of the Four Joint Books?

479
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:22,620
=We are unable to connect you to the phone now.
Please wait while we direct you to the voice mail.=

480
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:28,720
Hyeong, why did you get up?
You're not suppose to get up yet.

481
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:30,520
Where's Myeong Wol?

482
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:32,020
Why don't I see Myeong Wol?

483
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:33,420
She'll be here soon.

484
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:34,720
And when will that be?

485
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:35,620
Hyeong...

486
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:38,320
I'm sure something must have
happened to Myeong Wol.

487
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:41,920
Hyeong, Myeong Wol is just fine.
Nothing has happened to her.

488
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:44,320
The doctor said that if you're not careful,
you might sustain another injury.

489
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,220
He said that you absolutely must not move.

490
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:48,420
I have to see for myself,
that Myeong Wol is okay.

491
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:50,020
Hyeong, I get it, I get it.

492
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:51,520
I'll bring Myeong Wol over.

493
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:55,020
Will that do, huh? Just rest for a while.

494
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:04,720
So then, what are your plans ahead?

495
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:08,220
I have no other option.

496
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,720
So...

497
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:14,720
By staying by his side, I'll be exposing
that person to more danger.

498
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:19,620
I don't want him to suffer any further,
because of me.

499
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:22,820
But if he finds out that you've left,

500
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:26,320
Gang U will suffer quite a blow.

501
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:31,320
If they stay together,
he'll have to live with anxiety...

502
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:33,920
unable to have a day of peace.

503
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:39,920
<i>Hello! Ajussi! Ajumma!</i>
(Ajussi - middle aged man / uncle)
(Ajumma - middle aged woman / aunt)

504
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,620
Isn't that Dae Gang?

505
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:43,920
Wait a minute!

506
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:48,820
What? She didn't drop by?

507
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:50,820
That's right.

508
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:54,720
We can't get in touch with her.
We're really worried as well.

509
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:57,120
Where could she have gone?

510
00:38:57,420 --> 00:39:01,520
In order to let her rest,
I've been attending to Hyeong all this while.

511
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:08,420
Oh, by the way, some strangers came by
during the day and asked about Myeong Wol.

512
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:09,620
What?

513
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:10,820
Really?

514
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:13,420
Do you, perhaps, know why?

515
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:18,520
They appear to be with the police
or something of that sort.

516
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:21,220
How could we know?

517
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:24,820
That's right. Why would they be asking for Myeong Wol?

518
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:27,620
Just where did she go?

519
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:31,220
She's must be feeling upset, so she's
probably gone for a walk somewhere.

520
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:34,120
That's right. To have this happen during the wedding...

521
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:36,620
must have been quite a shock.

522
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:37,920
She should be back soon.

523
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:40,120
That's what I thought.

524
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:41,620
But Gang U hyeong keeps calling for her.

525
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:44,220
What? What do you mean by that?

526
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:46,520
Has Gang U regained consciousness?

527
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:47,720
Yes.

528
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:52,820
<i>That's great. That's really great.</i>

529
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:55,720
<i>But when he woke up, his request for
Myeong Wol is making things difficult.</i>

530
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:59,120
<i>I was afraid that he would worry, so I couldn't
tell him that someone was seeking her out.</i>

531
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:02,120
<i>What should I tell him when I get back?</i>

532
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:11,620
You've deciphered the secret of the
Four Joint Books, haven't you?

533
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:16,520
A few years from now, whoever that has it
will become the center of the world.

534
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:21,820
It was proclaimed that in the Four Joint Books,

535
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:24,020
lies a map with a hidden password.

536
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:25,520
I'm aware of that, too.

537
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:29,920
The map indicates a number of areas
in Manchuria and the Korean Peninsula.

538
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:31,520
The areas that have been identified,

539
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:34,620
as historians believe, would provide the treasure
that would make someone the center of the world.

540
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:38,320
So, what is that treasure?

541
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:41,420
According to the common areas
that have been identified,

542
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:44,020
and from the contents of the books,

543
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:46,820
I've managed to decipher the secret.

544
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:49,820
From the results, the treasure is...

545
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:51,220
The treasure is?

546
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:54,420
Rare earth metal.

547
00:40:56,020 --> 00:41:00,220
Rare earth metal? What's rare earth metal?

548
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:04,820
It refers to rare minerals and
includes the 15 lanthanoids.

549
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:07,620
There are a total of 17 elements
in this rare earth metal.

550
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:09,920
Really?

551
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:13,020
With the electronic industries as they are now...

552
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:16,720
for all sorts of electronic products,
power stations...

553
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:21,320
and even for weapons production,
it will be a much needed natural resource.

554
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:24,820
That's right.
So right now...

555
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:29,920
in order to get hold of this natural resource,
the whole world is fighting over...

556
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,520
knowledge of where these deposits are located.

557
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:36,120
In the decades to come,

558
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:40,020
whoever gets hold of it will become
the center of the world.

559
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:45,220
Rare earth metal...
That's right, it's rare earth metal!

560
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:47,620
As long as you get the mining rights,

561
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:52,520
Chairman, you will gain control of the world,
as you would have hoped.

562
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:55,820
But...

563
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:04,220
if this goes through the NSA,
it  falls into the hands of the government. What then?

564
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:09,120
Would you still own the exclusive rights
to the mining sites?

565
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:24,220
Search him thoroughly.

566
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:25,220
Yes.

567
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:32,820
Unless I'm an idiot,
why would I bring them with me?

568
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:35,420
That's enough.

569
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:41,020
Okay. What's the condition?

570
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:46,120
Let Han Myeong Wol return to North Korea safely.

571
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:01,720
Why is it so quiet?

572
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:03,920
Isn't anyone around?

573
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:33,520
Aren't these the photos from Gang U's showcase?

574
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:38,420
Myeong Wol with Choe?

575
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:01,419
-=Han Myeong Wol is bodyguard to North Korea's
Politburo fifth-ranked General Kim's daughter.=-

576
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:05,016
-=Name: Choe Ryu,
Nationality: North Korean (DPRK)=-

577
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:07,520
What's this?

578
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:10,920
Then, he's a spy?

579
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:14,020
Is he really a spy?

580
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:16,520
Han Myeong Wol, as well?

581
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:29,620
Where have you been?

582
00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:32,720
Is Comrade Han Myeong Wol okay now?

583
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:33,820
Yes.

584
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:35,820
So far, nothing has happened...

585
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:38,620
So, when will she return to the North?

586
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:44,320
Comrade Myeong Wol,
seemed to have made up her mind.

587
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:46,720
Right now, she seems to think that

588
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:51,220
even if she stays by Comrade Gang U's side,
she'll only bring him trouble.

589
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:53,820
That's not too far from the truth.

590
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:58,020
Where is she now?

591
00:44:58,020 --> 00:44:59,820
Upstairs.

592
00:45:01,420 --> 00:45:02,920
By the way...

593
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:05,720
have you heard the news?

594
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:09,220
It seems that Gang U has already
regained consciousness.

595
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:10,520
What?

596
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:14,420
Because of that,
she hasn't been in a good mood since.

597
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:16,920
She probably really wants to see him.

598
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:19,220
How can she not?

599
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:47,720
Please get up.

600
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:53,920
Comrade Major.

601
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:57,320
I'll only give you ten minutes

602
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:02,620
to see him one last time.

603
00:46:43,620 --> 00:46:46,420
<i>Being born North Korean</i>

604
00:46:47,020 --> 00:46:51,720
<i>and falling in love with a South Korean,
is a mistake.</i>

605
00:46:53,020 --> 00:46:56,720
<i>Such things only happen in fiction.</i>

606
00:46:57,320 --> 00:47:00,820
<i>I should never have dreamt
about this from the start.</i>

607
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:07,920
<i>To finally see you safe and sound,</i>

608
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:09,920
<i>I feel really fortunate.</i>

609
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:17,020
<i>Thank you for the wonderful times.</i>

610
00:47:23,020 --> 00:47:24,620
Myeong Wol.

611
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:30,120
Han Myeong Wol.

612
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:38,220
You're awake?

613
00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:41,920
It seems I woke you up.

614
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:44,420
Where did you go?

615
00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:46,720
Do you know how long
I've been looking for you?

616
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:48,820
Where could I possibly go?

617
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:50,620
Am I not here?

618
00:47:50,620 --> 00:47:53,020
You're okay, right?

619
00:47:53,020 --> 00:47:55,820
Nothing's happened, right?

620
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:06,620
Don't go anywhere.

621
00:48:06,620 --> 00:48:09,320
You must always be by my side.

622
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:12,520
All right.

623
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:27,520
I feel alive at last,
just seeing your face.

624
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:32,920
After I'm discharged from the hospital,

625
00:48:33,620 --> 00:48:36,420
I'll begin preparations for our wedding again.

626
00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:39,820
For all that you have suffered,

627
00:48:40,620 --> 00:48:45,220
I will definitely make it up to you in happiness.

628
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:52,920
Must we do it that way?

629
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:03,620
Get some sleep...
You need to rest.

630
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:23,720
Han Myeong Wol.

631
00:49:27,620 --> 00:49:29,620
This doesn't make sense.

632
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:33,320
How could that be?
How could Miss Myeong Wol be a....

633
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:35,120
What about Myeong Wol?

634
00:49:35,420 --> 00:49:37,620
Hyeong, you're awake!

635
00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:41,320
Tell me the truth.

636
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:43,420
Is there something going on?

637
00:49:43,420 --> 00:49:45,920
Nothing's going on, Hyeong...

638
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:48,320
Are you still not going to come clean?

639
00:49:48,620 --> 00:49:52,920
<i>Sometime back, some people looking into
information regarding Miss Myeong Wol.</i>

640
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:55,220
<i>After that day, Miss Myeong Wol disappeared.</i>

641
00:49:55,220 --> 00:49:58,420
<i>That's why I found those people strange.</i>

642
00:49:58,420 --> 00:50:00,520
<i>However, don't be shocked...</i>

643
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:02,320
<i>It was said that Miss Myeong Wol...</i>

644
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:04,220
<i>is a spy.</i>

645
00:50:17,220 --> 00:50:18,320
Aigoo, why are you here?

646
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:20,120
You should still be lying in hospital.

647
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:22,020
Why did you come?

648
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:23,520
Are you okay now?

649
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,320
Is it alright for you to be walking around like that?

650
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:28,820
Myeong Wol. Where's Myeong Wol?

651
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:32,420
Please allow me to see Myeong Wol.

652
00:50:32,620 --> 00:50:34,120
She's not here.

653
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:35,020
What?

654
00:50:35,020 --> 00:50:38,120
She was here until just a while ago.

655
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:41,820
Teacher Choe Ryu just took her away.

656
00:50:42,020 --> 00:50:44,020
Taken away? Where to?

657
00:50:44,020 --> 00:50:46,920
He said that being here was unsafe.

658
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:48,720
So where did they go?

659
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:51,020
Where they went, we don't know either.

660
00:50:51,020 --> 00:50:52,720
Do you really not know?

661
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:55,820
Or, are you deliberately not telling me?

662
00:50:55,820 --> 00:50:58,520
Oh, we really don't know!

663
00:50:59,420 --> 00:51:05,820
Aigoo. All right.
You'll find out anyway so I'll just tell you.

664
00:51:06,420 --> 00:51:09,320
They said that before they get the
boat tickets to return to the North,

665
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:12,420
they'll need to hide in a safe place.

666
00:51:12,620 --> 00:51:17,320
But they said it's not okay for us to know,
so they didn't tell us where.

667
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:19,220
To the North?

668
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:23,220
Myeong Wol...
don't go looking for her anymore.

669
00:51:23,820 --> 00:51:26,820
No matter what, it's an impossible fate.

670
00:51:26,820 --> 00:51:30,020
Doing this will only make things
more difficult for Myeong Wol.

671
00:51:35,620 --> 00:51:38,720
Aigoo, I really can't stand to watch any longer.

672
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:41,420
Those two are just so pitiful.

673
00:51:41,420 --> 00:51:42,720
Don't cry.

674
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:56,020
Where's this place?

675
00:51:56,920 --> 00:52:02,620
This is where Gang U and I spent the night,
when we got lost in the mountains.

676
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:05,820
Will it be uncomfortable for you?

677
00:52:06,620 --> 00:52:08,820
I'll be fine.

678
00:52:08,820 --> 00:52:11,320
You'll need to endure for awhile.

679
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:13,520
Don't worry about me.

680
00:52:14,620 --> 00:52:17,120
I'll go gather some branches for firewood.

681
00:52:18,820 --> 00:52:20,820
Thank you.

682
00:52:22,820 --> 00:52:24,620
For being able to...

683
00:52:24,620 --> 00:52:26,820
accompany me at a time like this.

684
00:52:28,620 --> 00:52:33,920
I've always been by your side.

685
00:52:41,420 --> 00:52:43,720
You said Gang U has woken up?

686
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:48,920
Then could he have the news
about Han Myeong Wol?

687
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:51,220
I'm not too sure about that.

688
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:05,420
Yes, it's me.

689
00:53:05,420 --> 00:53:08,020
I heard that you've woken up.

690
00:53:08,020 --> 00:53:11,420
So I was just about to call to
congratulate you.

691
00:53:11,420 --> 00:53:14,720
From your voice, you sound pretty healthy.

692
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:16,920
Thank you for your concern.

693
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:19,320
<i>Well, that's nothing.</i>

694
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:22,820
I realized after I woke up,
that you didn't keep your promise.

695
00:53:22,820 --> 00:53:25,220
Don't blame me.

696
00:53:25,220 --> 00:53:29,620
That guy Choe Ryu, wasn't sincere about
bringing the Four Joint Books over.

697
00:53:29,620 --> 00:53:31,320
So what else could I have done?

698
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:33,420
Was there no other choice?

699
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:37,920
That has always been your excuse.

700
00:53:38,220 --> 00:53:42,120
You've taken away all the people
who meant something to me.

701
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:46,420
However, this time, I won't just let it slide.

702
00:53:46,420 --> 00:53:50,020
Right now, are you threatening me?

703
00:53:50,020 --> 00:53:52,020
If that's the case, what can you do to me?

704
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:56,120
I will tell the world about how you killed my father.

705
00:53:56,420 --> 00:54:00,720
Then with my own eyes, I'll watch your downfall.

706
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:02,820
What did you say?

707
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:06,920
I have been cherishing our friendship all this time.

708
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:09,720
Even till now, I've been very patient.

709
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:13,920
Just what do you hope to achieve,
by bringing up things from 20 years ago?

710
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:17,620
Furthermore, do you have the evidence
to incriminate me?

711
00:54:17,620 --> 00:54:22,020
I've put in so much effort over the years
just to find you.

712
00:54:22,220 --> 00:54:25,120
Did you think I wouldn't have the evidence?

713
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:31,920
For Myeong Wol's sake,
I was prepared to forget about everything.

714
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:34,920
From this day on,

715
00:54:35,620 --> 00:54:37,320
you're finished.

716
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:54,020
<i>That brat really must have something.</i>

717
00:54:54,620 --> 00:54:56,920
<i>He doesn't seem to be joking.</i>

718
00:54:58,220 --> 00:55:04,720
<i>All the evidence from then
should have been destroyed.</i>

719
00:55:07,020 --> 00:55:08,020
You...

720
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:09,020
Yes.

721
00:55:09,220 --> 00:55:11,420
Find Han Myeong Wol.

722
00:55:11,820 --> 00:55:12,520
What?

723
00:55:12,820 --> 00:55:17,320
I want to make her unable to move.
That's the only solution left.

724
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:21,020
Moreover, by using Han Myeong Wol,

725
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:25,120
I can kill two birds with one stone.

726
00:55:33,220 --> 00:55:35,320
Hey listen...

727
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:38,720
Do you ever think about the past?

728
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:43,620
In order to participate in
the Special Forces Division,

729
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:46,920
I had to train in the mountains then,

730
00:55:49,820 --> 00:55:55,820
and I would get reprimanded
by Comrade Major every day.

731
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:14,920
<i>Comrade Han Myeong Wol.</i>

732
00:56:15,820 --> 00:56:18,420
<i>If you keep going like that,
you might as well not do it.</i>

733
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:21,420
<i>Working in the Special Forces Division
will never really suit you.</i>

734
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:24,720
<i>I will definitely stick with it.
Just wait and see.</i>

735
00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:32,120
<i>At that time, after listening
to Comrade Major's words,</i>

736
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:35,320
I should have given up.

737
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:42,020
Maybe I'm really not qualified.

738
00:56:43,620 --> 00:56:48,420
Always giving Comrade Major trouble.

739
00:56:50,620 --> 00:56:56,520
Why didn't you just leave me there?

740
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:01,120
Didn't I tell you before?

741
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:06,020
When your father entrusted you to me,

742
00:57:07,420 --> 00:57:10,620
I promised to protect you until the very end.

743
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:14,120
That...

744
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:21,320
is the last task I gave myself.

745
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:39,020
Are you crazy?

746
00:57:39,220 --> 00:57:41,020
How can you walk around in this state?

747
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:43,020
Does the hospital know you're out?

748
00:57:43,220 --> 00:57:45,220
Be quiet, come and sit.

749
00:57:50,620 --> 00:57:53,420
It's because you look weak.

750
00:57:54,420 --> 00:57:55,820
Are you okay?

751
00:57:56,620 --> 00:58:00,320
Do you know where Choe Ryu is?

752
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:04,020
How would I know?

753
00:58:05,820 --> 00:58:10,120
Since we're at it,
I'll ask you one thing...

754
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:15,320
Did you already know?

755
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:17,720
Know what?

756
00:58:18,220 --> 00:58:19,520
Them.

757
00:58:26,220 --> 00:58:28,420
Their identities.

758
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:32,420
How did you find out about that?

759
00:58:33,020 --> 00:58:34,220
You already knew and you're still like this?

760
00:58:34,420 --> 00:58:36,020
She intends to surrender.

761
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:37,020
What?

762
00:58:37,220 --> 00:58:39,220
Myeong Wol intends to surrender.

763
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:43,620
So we have to find Myeong Wol.
She's missing.

764
00:58:43,820 --> 00:58:45,120
So what?

765
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:46,420
Please help me.

766
00:58:46,620 --> 00:58:49,920
How can I help you?
What can I do?

767
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:54,220
I'm sorry.

768
00:58:55,220 --> 00:58:57,520
I also don't know what to do.

769
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:00,620
Anyway, I understand now.

770
00:59:01,020 --> 00:59:02,420
Excuse me.

771
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:06,720
Is Choe Ryu also involved in this?

772
00:59:08,020 --> 00:59:10,320
Yes, perhaps.

773
00:59:14,420 --> 00:59:15,920
I'll try.

774
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:19,020
I said I'll try.

775
00:59:20,020 --> 00:59:23,620
I'll think of a way to call Choe Ryu out.

776
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:18,620
<i>Grandfather wants to see you.</i>

777
01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:38,120
What's the matter?
Why is the Chairman looking for me?

778
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:43,920
I'm sorry, it wasn't Grandfather.
It was someone else.

779
01:01:00,620 --> 01:01:02,520
Where is Myeong Wol right now?

780
01:01:02,820 --> 01:01:04,120
Let me see her.

781
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:09,120
Do you know how difficult it
is for Han Myeong Wol right now?

782
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:11,220
I beg you, please let me see her.

783
01:01:11,420 --> 01:01:14,520
I can't just let her leave like that.
I beg you, please.

784
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:19,720
For your own good,
you also have to give up.

785
01:01:20,620 --> 01:01:23,620
That is Han Myeong Wol's intention.

786
01:01:27,220 --> 01:01:29,620
You also know what it feels like, don't you?

787
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:33,620
Missing her to death.

788
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:37,020
If I'm not by her side, it's so painful
I might as well die.

789
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:21,720
Search every corner of
this mountain carefully!

790
01:02:22,020 --> 01:02:23,320
- Yes.
- Yes.

791
01:02:38,020 --> 01:02:40,420
<i>Hey, do you know how funny
you look right now?</i>

792
01:02:41,220 --> 01:02:42,620
<i>What are you doing?</i>

793
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:46,320
<i>I must keep this and look at it
when I am in a bad mood.</i>

794
01:03:57,720 --> 01:03:59,420
Han Myeong Wol...

795
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:03,120
I found you.

796
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


797
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


798
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


799
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


800
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
