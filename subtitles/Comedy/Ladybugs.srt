1
00:00:21,501 --> 00:00:25,130
When you got up this morning
and you looked in the mirror,

2
00:00:25,605 --> 00:00:27,197
you were losers!

3
00:00:27,274 --> 00:00:31,005
When you came here this morning,
you were losers!

4
00:00:31,445 --> 00:00:33,242
Now look at you!

5
00:00:34,314 --> 00:00:36,339
To succeed in this world,

6
00:00:36,516 --> 00:00:39,747
we must do everything we can
to appear successful.

7
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:42,118
So when people criticize you,

8
00:00:42,189 --> 00:00:45,317
fill you with insecurity and self-doubt,

9
00:00:46,293 --> 00:00:47,692
whip it out!

10
00:00:49,896 --> 00:00:53,229
I am great! I am wonderful!

11
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:54,995
Everybody likes me!

12
00:00:55,135 --> 00:00:56,227
Stand up!

13
00:00:56,737 --> 00:00:58,136
Whip it out!

14
00:00:58,472 --> 00:01:01,771
I am great. I am wonderful.

15
00:01:01,875 --> 00:01:03,502
Everybody likes me.

16
00:01:03,577 --> 00:01:06,512
I am great. I am wonderful.

17
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:08,138
Everybody likes me.

18
00:01:08,215 --> 00:01:09,477
Sit down!

19
00:01:10,283 --> 00:01:12,911
Congratulations, ladies and gentlemen.

20
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:17,916
You are now prepared and equipped
to take your rightful places

21
00:01:18,225 --> 00:01:20,352
as captains of industry.

22
00:01:21,061 --> 00:01:23,052
You are ready and armed!

23
00:01:23,563 --> 00:01:25,929
And remember, when you get a job,

24
00:01:26,199 --> 00:01:28,895
make sure your boss is taller than you.

25
00:01:29,536 --> 00:01:32,164
That way it's easier to kiss his ass.

26
00:01:35,375 --> 00:01:37,275
I make a joke. I make a joke.

27
00:01:37,344 --> 00:01:39,312
Okay, everybody, stand up!

28
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:43,679
- I am great. I am wonderful.
- I am great. I am wonderful.

29
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:45,479
- Everybody likes me.
- Everybody likes me.

30
00:01:45,552 --> 00:01:48,146
- I am great. I am wonderful.
- I am great. I am wonderful.

31
00:01:48,221 --> 00:01:49,848
- Everybody likes me.
- Everybody likes me.

32
00:01:49,923 --> 00:01:51,151
Shut up!

33
00:02:29,796 --> 00:02:31,696
- Hello?
- I just want to remind you,

34
00:02:31,765 --> 00:02:34,461
you have a meeting
with the man himself, Mr. Mullen.

35
00:02:34,534 --> 00:02:36,627
10:00 tomorrow, in his office.
So don't forget.

36
00:02:36,703 --> 00:02:39,501
So far it's just a meeting,
so, you know, don't count on anything.

37
00:02:39,573 --> 00:02:43,634
Are you kidding? It's in the bag.
And I don't care what you think, Julie,

38
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:46,406
those seminars
with Dr. Von Kemp really paid off.

39
00:02:48,114 --> 00:02:51,277
Good luck, Chester. You deserve it.

40
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:55,854
My name is Chester.
I'm great. I'm wonderful.

41
00:02:55,922 --> 00:02:57,150
Everybody likes me.

42
00:02:57,224 --> 00:03:00,284
My name is Chester.
I'm great. I'm wonderful.

43
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,588
Everybody likes me.

44
00:03:01,661 --> 00:03:04,391
Hey, Chester. My name's Harlin,

45
00:03:04,464 --> 00:03:08,230
and to me, you look like a giant asshole.

46
00:03:08,835 --> 00:03:11,269
Well, if I'm an asshole,
there's a reason for it.

47
00:03:11,338 --> 00:03:12,999
You're contagious.

48
00:03:15,509 --> 00:03:16,874
Oh, yeah?

49
00:03:17,344 --> 00:03:20,006
All those beautiful people
in this neighborhood

50
00:03:23,316 --> 00:03:25,614
Hey, let's beautify the neighborhood

51
00:03:26,052 --> 00:03:27,781
Oh, honey.

52
00:03:28,455 --> 00:03:29,649
Stay indoors.

53
00:03:47,874 --> 00:03:52,243
The way you made love last summer
You ruined my spring

54
00:03:55,682 --> 00:03:57,479
Hey, Matthew, catch.

55
00:04:00,053 --> 00:04:03,079
- Nice try. Where's your mother?
- I don't know. I'm busy.

56
00:04:05,292 --> 00:04:08,090
Hey, Matthew, not too close.
You'll strain your eyes.

57
00:04:08,161 --> 00:04:09,685
And later on in other places.

58
00:04:28,748 --> 00:04:31,046
- Guess who.
- Tom Cruise.

59
00:04:31,151 --> 00:04:32,482
No, close.

60
00:04:32,852 --> 00:04:35,082
I have no idea.
You have to give me a hint.

61
00:04:35,155 --> 00:04:37,385
It's the man who for you
would swim the deepest ocean,

62
00:04:37,457 --> 00:04:40,858
climb the highest mountain
and sees bluebirds when you smile.

63
00:04:41,328 --> 00:04:44,923
- You crazy girl.
- Chester, hi.

64
00:04:47,167 --> 00:04:49,158
Oh, flowers.

65
00:04:51,004 --> 00:04:53,996
All right. It's not my birthday.
What have you done wrong?

66
00:04:54,074 --> 00:04:55,769
Honey, nothing is wrong.
Everything is right.

67
00:04:55,842 --> 00:04:58,743
10:00 tomorrow morning,
I'm seeing the big boss, Mr. Mullen.

68
00:04:58,812 --> 00:05:02,714
My promotion is in the bag.
I can hear those wedding bells now.

69
00:05:03,416 --> 00:05:06,783
Yeah, it sounds great, Chester,
but I've heard it all before.

70
00:05:06,853 --> 00:05:08,787
And Matthew and I,
we're getting along better.

71
00:05:08,855 --> 00:05:11,221
Last Christmas
we weren't getting along at all.

72
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:12,815
And I gave him a BB gun,

73
00:05:12,892 --> 00:05:15,486
he gave me a sweatshirt
with a bull's-eye on the back.

74
00:05:15,562 --> 00:05:17,359
I mean, he has a weird sense of humor.

75
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:20,399
I mean, Easter, he gave me
chocolate bunnies made of Exlax.

76
00:05:20,467 --> 00:05:24,028
But we'll work it out.
Bess, baby, listen to me.

77
00:05:24,604 --> 00:05:26,435
I'll be the father he never had.

78
00:05:27,741 --> 00:05:31,438
It's going to be first class all the way.
We'll take more vacations.

79
00:05:31,511 --> 00:05:34,742
- We'll stay in the best hotels.
- We'll steal better towels.

80
00:05:34,814 --> 00:05:37,874
- Hey, we'll join a country club.
- We'll become alcoholic snobs.

81
00:05:37,951 --> 00:05:41,751
We'll hang out with Maryann and Biff
and take Dad's car. That's deuce.

82
00:05:43,523 --> 00:05:45,423
How did I get so lucky?

83
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:55,635
Men. They only want one thing.

84
00:05:55,735 --> 00:06:00,502
But if they don't want to marry me,
they ain't getting that thing no more.

85
00:06:00,974 --> 00:06:03,499
Because if I can't sell it

86
00:06:03,943 --> 00:06:07,435
I'm gonna sit right down on it

87
00:06:07,614 --> 00:06:12,950
Before I ever give it away

88
00:06:14,487 --> 00:06:16,614
- Beautiful, beautiful.
- Oh, Chester.

89
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:20,259
I'd ask for an encore, but I'm busy.
It's time to see the man.

90
00:06:20,326 --> 00:06:22,817
Then it's on to bigger and better things.

91
00:06:22,896 --> 00:06:26,354
So, goodbye, old office.
Goodbye, desk. Goodbye, chair.

92
00:06:26,499 --> 00:06:28,296
You didn't say goodbye to the plants.

93
00:06:28,802 --> 00:06:30,235
I talked enough to them plants.

94
00:06:30,303 --> 00:06:32,863
They say if you get too friendly,
it's no good, you know.

95
00:06:33,173 --> 00:06:34,868
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

96
00:06:34,941 --> 00:06:37,273
Oh, and I'm glad
you gave me the right finger.

97
00:06:39,145 --> 00:06:41,170
Mr. Mullen's board meeting is at 2:00.

98
00:06:41,247 --> 00:06:44,045
Then he has
a new mall dedication at 4:00.

99
00:06:44,651 --> 00:06:47,779
- Hey, sexy, how you doing?
- Oh, Chester.

100
00:06:47,854 --> 00:06:50,118
Hey, too bad I'm spoken for.
You're my type.

101
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:51,487
I love girls with eyeglasses.

102
00:06:51,558 --> 00:06:54,994
Take them home, you breathe heavy,
you know what you're doing, you know?

103
00:06:55,061 --> 00:06:57,529
Hey, tell Mr. Mullen
his top salesman is here.

104
00:06:57,597 --> 00:06:59,861
You could sell anything, Chester.

105
00:06:59,933 --> 00:07:02,766
I bet in your day
you sold a few things yourself.

106
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:06,568
Plenty of heat left in the old furnace,
huh, baby?

107
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:08,732
You know, I still can't believe
you never got married.

108
00:07:08,808 --> 00:07:11,242
You're too particular,
that's your problem.

109
00:07:11,311 --> 00:07:14,371
What do you say we practice
till you meet the right guy?

110
00:07:14,447 --> 00:07:15,812
Chester!

111
00:07:16,116 --> 00:07:17,777
I'll tell him you're here.

112
00:07:17,851 --> 00:07:19,182
Mr. Mullen...

113
00:07:20,653 --> 00:07:23,622
Mr. Mullen,
Chester Lee is here to see you.

114
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:25,817
Tell him to wait. I'm busy.

115
00:07:26,526 --> 00:07:29,689
Another employee
who thinks he's due a promotion.

116
00:07:30,296 --> 00:07:31,558
I have to let him down.

117
00:07:31,631 --> 00:07:34,998
As I was saying, David,
now, Brad was a great coach,

118
00:07:35,068 --> 00:07:36,763
but we don't have Brad anymore.

119
00:07:36,836 --> 00:07:40,533
Darling, we need a new coach.
Someone who knows what he's doing,

120
00:07:40,607 --> 00:07:43,474
to make sure the Ladybugs stay
a championship team.

121
00:07:43,676 --> 00:07:47,840
Now, we wouldn't want our daughter to
be on a team that are losers, would we?

122
00:07:48,148 --> 00:07:49,979
Do it for me, David.

123
00:07:50,483 --> 00:07:53,543
You know we like to do things
to make each other happy.

124
00:08:01,895 --> 00:08:04,090
Act on what I've said, David.

125
00:08:14,374 --> 00:08:16,239
Good day, Mrs. Mullen.

126
00:08:18,077 --> 00:08:20,978
That's Mrs. Mullen. She's very classy.

127
00:08:21,047 --> 00:08:22,480
Yeah, very classy.

128
00:08:22,549 --> 00:08:25,746
I heard when she drives her car,
she keeps her legs crossed.

129
00:08:27,921 --> 00:08:30,082
Yes, sir. You may go up now.

130
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:41,327
Hey, Mr. Mullen. How are you?

131
00:08:42,001 --> 00:08:43,662
Fine, Chester. And you?

132
00:08:43,736 --> 00:08:45,727
I'm great, great. Thank you. Yeah.

133
00:08:45,805 --> 00:08:49,832
I just saw your wife on the way out.
Lovely lady. She was in a hurry.

134
00:08:49,909 --> 00:08:53,276
Well, she's very busy, you know.
She does a lot of charity work.

135
00:08:53,346 --> 00:08:56,645
Yeah, I know.
She handles all the policemen's balls.

136
00:08:57,383 --> 00:09:00,511
The new mall in the south district.
Boy, what a beauty.

137
00:09:00,587 --> 00:09:03,078
I'll sell this space out in no time,
Mr. Mullen.

138
00:09:03,156 --> 00:09:05,351
Have no fear, Chester is here.

139
00:09:06,326 --> 00:09:08,760
Well, you know, Mr. Mullen,
the reason I asked to see you is,

140
00:09:08,828 --> 00:09:12,389
I've been with the firm now for 12 years
and I work very hard, you know.

141
00:09:12,465 --> 00:09:14,729
A look at the bulletin board,
you can see the last quarter,

142
00:09:14,801 --> 00:09:16,928
my sales are number one, you know.

143
00:09:17,103 --> 00:09:19,628
And, you know, I figure that,
you know, I'm due a...

144
00:09:20,106 --> 00:09:22,836
Well, you know, I'm entitled, I figured,
you know...

145
00:09:23,042 --> 00:09:25,602
I mean, if you can see your way clear,
you know...

146
00:09:25,678 --> 00:09:28,841
And you know, my girlfriend, Bess,
we want to get married

147
00:09:28,915 --> 00:09:29,973
and on my salary alone...

148
00:09:30,049 --> 00:09:32,244
I want her to quit her job,
it'll be a little rough for us.

149
00:09:32,318 --> 00:09:34,343
So I figure, you know, if...

150
00:09:34,454 --> 00:09:38,015
You know, I work hard.
And I'm a company man, you know?

151
00:09:38,992 --> 00:09:40,482
What do you think, huh?

152
00:09:43,062 --> 00:09:44,120
Yes?

153
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:46,020
All right. Put him on.

154
00:09:46,232 --> 00:09:49,463
Tom! No, no. Your timing's perfect.

155
00:09:49,535 --> 00:09:52,470
I'm not doing anything.
How's your golf game?

156
00:09:52,906 --> 00:09:56,535
You did? With who?
Judge Cole, that old bastard.

157
00:09:56,976 --> 00:09:59,376
Yeah, did he tell you the story
about the three hookers

158
00:09:59,445 --> 00:10:01,208
and the midget D. A?

159
00:10:01,481 --> 00:10:03,506
Yeah, head over heels.

160
00:10:05,818 --> 00:10:09,618
I was playing last week with Bobby
and that crazy Scott McTeague.

161
00:10:09,689 --> 00:10:11,816
We were out on number three,
you know, the par five.

162
00:10:11,891 --> 00:10:15,486
Bobby is on the green in two long hits.

163
00:10:15,695 --> 00:10:18,562
We walk up on the green,
Bobby's looking at a 60-foot...

164
00:10:18,631 --> 00:10:20,360
Chester, you're blowing it.

165
00:10:20,433 --> 00:10:21,730
...he walks on the green
and screams at him,

166
00:10:21,801 --> 00:10:25,362
"Christ, you can kick it in from there.
Take it away."

167
00:10:25,438 --> 00:10:27,872
Well, I got to kiss the boss' ass.

168
00:10:28,608 --> 00:10:30,701
Kiss the boss' ass, yeah.

169
00:10:31,411 --> 00:10:35,370
No, Ron will give us six strokes.
He wants the parking lot contract.

170
00:10:36,482 --> 00:10:38,109
You're right. I love to win.

171
00:10:39,052 --> 00:10:40,883
See you this weekend. Okay.

172
00:10:42,088 --> 00:10:43,953
Now, Chester, you were saying?

173
00:10:44,023 --> 00:10:46,787
Mr. Mullen,
I see you were quite a soccer player.

174
00:10:46,859 --> 00:10:49,191
Boy, look at all those trophies.

175
00:10:50,129 --> 00:10:53,098
Oh, boy, I bet you could teach me
a few things, huh?

176
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:54,565
You know, we have so much
in common.

177
00:10:54,634 --> 00:10:56,727
We both want the best
for Mullen Industries,

178
00:10:56,803 --> 00:10:59,363
- and we both played soccer.
- Chester.

179
00:11:00,773 --> 00:11:02,798
Chester, Chester, Chester.

180
00:11:03,409 --> 00:11:06,572
Come here.
Chester, I never played soccer.

181
00:11:06,746 --> 00:11:10,580
My company sponsors
a girl's soccer team, the Ladybugs.

182
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:14,049
They won these trophies,
and I'm very proud of them.

183
00:11:14,687 --> 00:11:17,247
Chester, keep up the good work.

184
00:11:17,457 --> 00:11:20,654
I am glad we had a chance
to have this little chat.

185
00:11:21,094 --> 00:11:24,621
Darling, I almost forgot.
There's a do tonight at the country club.

186
00:11:24,697 --> 00:11:27,495
- Dear, say hello to Chester Lee.
- How do you do?

187
00:11:27,567 --> 00:11:30,127
I'm not gonna sit
next to the Vandemiers.

188
00:11:30,203 --> 00:11:32,637
Chester was just admiring
our soccer trophies.

189
00:11:32,705 --> 00:11:35,435
He was telling me
he's quite the soccer player.

190
00:11:35,508 --> 00:11:36,873
Oh, really?

191
00:11:37,944 --> 00:11:41,641
- What position did you play?
- I was a...

192
00:11:42,682 --> 00:11:44,582
- A kicker.
- A kicker?

193
00:11:44,751 --> 00:11:48,243
Everyone on the team is a kicker.
I mean, what position?

194
00:11:48,388 --> 00:11:50,822
Well, you know, you name it,
I played it, Mrs. Mullen.

195
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:53,791
Yeah? Were you a sweeper
or a forward?

196
00:11:54,627 --> 00:11:58,427
Sweeper, forward, backward, outfield,
tight end, I played them all, you know?

197
00:11:58,498 --> 00:11:59,760
- You don't say.
- Yeah.

198
00:11:59,832 --> 00:12:03,131
I would've went pro,
but one night I pulled my groin muscle.

199
00:12:03,569 --> 00:12:06,936
- That must have been awful.
- Yeah. Somewhat exciting.

200
00:12:07,006 --> 00:12:08,906
You know, Mrs. Mullen,
when I see these trophies

201
00:12:08,975 --> 00:12:12,172
it reminds me how wonderful it is
to have a winning team.

202
00:12:12,745 --> 00:12:15,612
- What? You gonna coach what?
- Take it easy, will you?

203
00:12:15,681 --> 00:12:16,909
What the hell do you know
about soccer?

204
00:12:16,983 --> 00:12:19,781
Nothing, it just happened.
I was kissing the boss' ass,

205
00:12:19,852 --> 00:12:22,047
his wife came in,
I started kissing her ass.

206
00:12:22,121 --> 00:12:24,612
The next thing you know, they made me
coach of the soccer team.

207
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:26,783
- Well, did you get the promotion?
- I'll get the promotion.

208
00:12:26,859 --> 00:12:29,157
All we have to do
is bring home a championship team!

209
00:12:29,228 --> 00:12:30,718
"We?" What you talking about "we?"

210
00:12:30,797 --> 00:12:32,890
I told the Mullens
you'll be my assistant coach.

211
00:12:32,965 --> 00:12:37,527
That's great.
Goodbye, job. Hello, welfare.

212
00:12:37,637 --> 00:12:40,128
What could be so hard?
They were champs last year,

213
00:12:40,206 --> 00:12:43,004
champs the year before. I can't miss.
It's a piece of cake!

214
00:12:43,709 --> 00:12:47,076
Well, I'll tell you one thing,
you look like a coach.

215
00:12:47,146 --> 00:12:49,740
- You know anything else about soccer?
- Not much.

216
00:12:50,716 --> 00:12:54,049
All I know is, I got a lot of balls.

217
00:12:55,021 --> 00:12:56,921
Well, I got a book on soccer.

218
00:12:57,156 --> 00:12:59,249
It says in here, there are 11 positions.

219
00:12:59,325 --> 00:13:01,759
You got to be careful
when you read a book about positions.

220
00:13:01,828 --> 00:13:04,319
I read a book once,
100 Ways to Make Love.

221
00:13:04,564 --> 00:13:07,397
I ended up in traction. It was a misprint.

222
00:13:08,134 --> 00:13:12,070
Now, I've seen the Ladybugs' trophies,
and I know what the Ladybugs can do.

223
00:13:12,138 --> 00:13:15,574
And I'm not so foolish as to come here
and burden you with new techniques.

224
00:13:15,641 --> 00:13:18,804
I say, leave success alone, right, Julie?

225
00:13:19,312 --> 00:13:20,643
That's right, Coach Chester.

226
00:13:22,415 --> 00:13:23,746
Julie, look at the way you're eating.

227
00:13:23,816 --> 00:13:25,010
I thought you were getting in shape.

228
00:13:25,084 --> 00:13:26,779
What happened
to the weightlifting class?

229
00:13:26,853 --> 00:13:29,845
I'm doing good. I mean, this is heavy.

230
00:13:31,257 --> 00:13:34,454
Now, before we start our practice,
I want to get to know you.

231
00:13:34,527 --> 00:13:37,860
When I point to you,
I want you to stand up, state your name,

232
00:13:38,064 --> 00:13:40,999
and tell me how many goals
you scored last year.

233
00:13:41,067 --> 00:13:44,366
All right, we'll start with... you.

234
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:51,338
My name is Sally Anne Welfelt,
and I'm 12 years old, going on 13.

235
00:13:51,644 --> 00:13:54,340
My hobbies are ice-skating
and going shopping.

236
00:13:54,413 --> 00:13:57,439
- My favorite book is A Wrinkle in Time.
- All right. Okay, Sally Anne.

237
00:13:57,517 --> 00:14:00,543
Turn-ons: Good-Iooking guys, music,

238
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:05,382
good-Iooking guys, pizza,
good-Iooking guys, staying up late,

239
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:07,926
- and good-Iooking guys.
- Okay, okay, okay.

240
00:14:08,161 --> 00:14:11,062
Tell me, how many goals
did you score last year?

241
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:12,563
Goals? None.

242
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:15,926
- None?
- This is my first year.

243
00:14:16,002 --> 00:14:18,630
This is her first year.
Let's hear it for Welfelt.

244
00:14:18,704 --> 00:14:21,639
Give her
a big Ladybug reception, all right?

245
00:14:22,808 --> 00:14:24,673
Thank you, thank you so much.

246
00:14:24,744 --> 00:14:27,178
Okay, who's next? All right, you.

247
00:14:28,915 --> 00:14:31,577
Carmelita Chu. I collect butterflies.

248
00:14:31,651 --> 00:14:33,118
Okay, how many goals?

249
00:14:33,186 --> 00:14:36,417
I don't know what you're talking about.
I never played.

250
00:14:36,522 --> 00:14:40,390
- You know nothing about soccer?
- All I know is you can't use your hands.

251
00:14:40,793 --> 00:14:43,318
Okay, it's Chu's first year.

252
00:14:43,396 --> 00:14:47,332
Yeah, hold it, hold it, all right?
We'll make believe we heard it for Chu.

253
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,300
Okay, what's your name?

254
00:14:52,872 --> 00:14:55,340
The questions get harder
if you go along, you know.

255
00:14:56,576 --> 00:14:59,943
Do you want my first name
or my last name?

256
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,609
Whatever you can remember, kid.

257
00:15:04,283 --> 00:15:05,443
Penny...

258
00:15:08,254 --> 00:15:09,448
Pester.

259
00:15:10,223 --> 00:15:11,815
We'll come back to you later.

260
00:15:11,891 --> 00:15:15,486
Let me ask you this.
Which of you were on last year's team?

261
00:15:17,463 --> 00:15:19,454
One? Only one?

262
00:15:21,334 --> 00:15:25,100
Nancy Larimer. Last remaining player
from the Ladybug dynasty.

263
00:15:25,204 --> 00:15:27,536
And you, Coach Chester,
are just in time,

264
00:15:27,607 --> 00:15:30,405
for what they call in the pros
a rebuilding year.

265
00:15:31,777 --> 00:15:36,043
A rebuilding year. Thanks a lot.
I'm off to a great stop.

266
00:15:38,918 --> 00:15:40,579
Hi. I'm sorry I'm late.

267
00:15:40,653 --> 00:15:42,450
Tardiness is something
I will not tolerate.

268
00:15:42,521 --> 00:15:44,819
- What's your name?
- Kimberly, Kimberly Mullen.

269
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:47,518
Well, let me tell you this,
Kimberly Mullen...

270
00:15:48,494 --> 00:15:51,190
Kimberly Mullen?
Is your father David Mullen?

271
00:15:51,264 --> 00:15:53,596
Yes, he is. Look, I'm sorry I'm late.
I just...

272
00:15:53,666 --> 00:15:57,261
Don't be sorry.
The traffic out there is ridiculous.

273
00:15:57,336 --> 00:15:59,270
I'm glad you showed up at all,
for crying out...

274
00:15:59,338 --> 00:16:01,966
You're a lovely little girl.
Come on over here with me, will you?

275
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:04,407
Kids, move it, move it, kids.
Beat it, will you? Come on here.

276
00:16:04,477 --> 00:16:06,468
Right over here, honey.
Sit down there, will you?

277
00:16:06,545 --> 00:16:07,978
There you go. Oh, I'm sorry,

278
00:16:08,047 --> 00:16:10,709
I should have had
a bigger handkerchief, you know?

279
00:16:10,783 --> 00:16:13,308
Now he's kissing the daughter's ass.

280
00:16:13,786 --> 00:16:17,620
For the land of the free

281
00:16:19,659 --> 00:16:22,321
And the home

282
00:16:22,461 --> 00:16:28,297
Of the brave

283
00:16:35,007 --> 00:16:36,702
The song is over.

284
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:39,039
Hello, soccer fans.

285
00:16:39,145 --> 00:16:41,511
This is the day
we've all been waiting for,

286
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:43,844
the start of the
Rocky Mountain Soccer League,

287
00:16:43,916 --> 00:16:45,781
junior girls division.

288
00:16:47,753 --> 00:16:52,019
Starting off the season today are
the Tornadoes versus the Ladybugs.

289
00:16:52,658 --> 00:16:55,320
The game's going to be
getting underway in just a second.

290
00:16:55,394 --> 00:16:58,591
We're all looking forward
for a fun day of soccer.

291
00:16:58,931 --> 00:17:02,458
Look at them.
What a day this is going to be.

292
00:17:02,735 --> 00:17:06,068
I feel like I'm walking up a gangplank
and there's no ship.

293
00:17:06,138 --> 00:17:07,435
Well, you better do something.

294
00:17:07,506 --> 00:17:10,236
Here comes the shark
wearing designer clothes and a Rolex.

295
00:17:10,309 --> 00:17:14,109
Chester, my wife and I are so relieved

296
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:16,648
to have a coach of your ability.

297
00:17:16,716 --> 00:17:21,312
A man in charge,
a man who really knows his soccer.

298
00:17:22,121 --> 00:17:24,851
Win the game,
win the game, win the game.

299
00:17:25,591 --> 00:17:28,321
Get the book,
get the book, get the book.

300
00:17:36,869 --> 00:17:38,996
"Hello, and welcome
to the wonderful world

304
00:17:48,814 --> 00:17:50,042

00:17:54,053 --> 00:17:56,886
"can bring one
the greatest sense of pride.

307
00:18:00,359 --> 00:18:02,953
"If kicking is the most important thing
in soccer,

308
00:18:03,028 --> 00:18:06,225
"ball control
is the second most important thing."

309
00:18:14,507 --> 00:18:16,202
Son of a bitch!

310
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:19,974
She'll get a lot of mileage
out of that one.

311
00:18:20,045 --> 00:18:23,708
"Number two,
move into the path of the ball.

312
00:18:24,183 --> 00:18:27,812
"Number three,
treat the ball as if it were a fragile egg.

313
00:18:27,887 --> 00:18:30,856
"Relax and withdraw
when you make contact."

314
00:18:34,026 --> 00:18:36,392
I tell you, that Welfelt has power.

315
00:18:36,462 --> 00:18:40,228
You know, with the right training,
she could be the best player we have.

316
00:18:40,299 --> 00:18:42,267
The best player we have?

317
00:18:42,401 --> 00:18:45,234
What about Larimer, there,
the little black girl?

318
00:18:45,304 --> 00:18:46,566
She's the best player we have.

319
00:18:46,639 --> 00:18:49,665
Now, you know that black people
are the best at sports, come on.

320
00:18:49,742 --> 00:18:51,369
We're the best runners,
the fastest runners,

321
00:18:51,444 --> 00:18:53,002
the best at track,
we're the best at baseball,

322
00:18:53,078 --> 00:18:55,273
the best at boxing,
the best at basketball, football.

323
00:18:55,347 --> 00:18:57,338
I mean, hey, you name it.

324
00:18:58,717 --> 00:19:01,550
Black people, best at sports.
You kidding?

325
00:19:02,188 --> 00:19:03,587
How about hockey?

326
00:19:05,591 --> 00:19:07,218
Yeah, water polo.

327
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:11,889
Fencing. Best at sports. Badminton.

328
00:19:13,165 --> 00:19:15,827
Yachting. Best at sports, you kidding?

329
00:19:15,901 --> 00:19:17,926
I forgot fox hunting.

330
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:19,728
Best at sports.

331
00:19:20,139 --> 00:19:21,538
Come on.

332
00:19:21,974 --> 00:19:26,809
"More than anything, the goalie
is the intellectual ruler of the game.

333
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:31,676
"Sharp, cunning, observant."

334
00:19:33,452 --> 00:19:34,646
Number four,

335
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,622
anybody who coaches
a girls' soccer team is completely nuts.

336
00:19:40,759 --> 00:19:44,388
Okay, folks. That does it
for the first game of the season.

337
00:19:44,463 --> 00:19:48,490
Final score,
Tornadoes 9, Ladybugs nothing.

338
00:19:49,068 --> 00:19:50,592
Coach Chester, over here, please.

339
00:19:50,669 --> 00:19:53,695
No pictures, please.
I don't want to be seen here.

340
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:55,802
Chester.

341
00:19:56,976 --> 00:20:01,310
My wife and I are very disappointed.
We expected a much better showing.

342
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,914
Well, now look at it this way,
Mr. Mullen,

343
00:20:03,983 --> 00:20:06,781
so far this year,
they only lost one game, you know.

344
00:20:06,952 --> 00:20:08,817
Normally, this wouldn't
be so important to me

345
00:20:08,888 --> 00:20:10,981
but you know how involved
my wife and daughter are.

346
00:20:11,056 --> 00:20:13,718
So now I am totally involved.

347
00:20:14,193 --> 00:20:16,161
As you know, Chester,
I'm a very competitive man.

348
00:20:16,228 --> 00:20:17,820
And I love being the best.

349
00:20:17,897 --> 00:20:20,889
If you can take this bunch of beginners
and turn them into a winning team,

350
00:20:20,966 --> 00:20:22,957
that, to me, shows leadership.

351
00:20:23,035 --> 00:20:26,596
The kind of leadership I want
at the head of my sales department.

352
00:20:26,939 --> 00:20:31,171
I don't believe it.
That was absolutely dreadful.

353
00:20:31,343 --> 00:20:34,904
I hope you do better for us next time.
David, darling, let's go.

354
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:36,709
My wife and I are going away
for the weekend.

355
00:20:36,782 --> 00:20:40,513
I want to see better results.
We'll be back on Monday, if not sooner.

356
00:20:46,091 --> 00:20:47,922
He won't be back any sooner.

357
00:20:48,527 --> 00:20:49,687
That's it.

358
00:20:49,762 --> 00:20:52,196
I'll show up for practice today,
then I'm quitting.

359
00:20:52,264 --> 00:20:54,323
Chester, you have to think
about what you're doing.

360
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,334
You can't quit now. You'll lose your job.

361
00:20:56,402 --> 00:20:58,393
And if you lose your job, I'll lose my job.

362
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:00,165
Then you have no future,
and I'll have no car,

363
00:21:00,239 --> 00:21:02,537
no dishwasher, no TV, no furniture.
You can't quit now!

364
00:21:02,608 --> 00:21:05,236
I got to quit.
Coaching these kids is driving me nuts.

365
00:21:05,311 --> 00:21:07,176
Last night I had a dream,
I was a soccer ball,

366
00:21:07,246 --> 00:21:08,611
and Bess kept kicking me.

367
00:21:08,681 --> 00:21:11,241
And I told her, "Don't touch me.
You can't use your hands."

368
00:21:11,317 --> 00:21:12,750
Chester, calm down.

369
00:21:12,818 --> 00:21:15,514
Julie, I can't win.
If I tell Bess I didn't get the promotion,

370
00:21:15,588 --> 00:21:17,180
I'll let her down again. It could be over.

371
00:21:17,256 --> 00:21:18,746
And I can't stand lying to her.

372
00:21:18,824 --> 00:21:20,655
It used to be,
I couldn't wait to be with her.

373
00:21:20,726 --> 00:21:24,218
Now I feel guilty when I face her.
I don't even want to look at her.

374
00:21:24,296 --> 00:21:26,730
Bess, baby, am I glad to see you!

375
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:30,792
Hi, honey. Hi, Julie.
I came to show you wedding invitations.

376
00:21:30,869 --> 00:21:32,427
Oh, good.
You can show us on the way down.

377
00:21:32,504 --> 00:21:34,165
We're late for our team's practice,
you know.

378
00:21:34,239 --> 00:21:36,469
Practice? Chester,
why are you dressed like that?

379
00:21:36,542 --> 00:21:37,804
Didn't I tell you?

380
00:21:37,876 --> 00:21:40,208
I'm coaching the company soccer team,
the Ladybugs.

381
00:21:40,279 --> 00:21:42,839
It sort of goes with the promotion,
you know.

382
00:21:42,915 --> 00:21:45,941
- Excuse me. Getting off.
- Getting off.

383
00:21:49,054 --> 00:21:52,319
All right, but before you go,
I just want to show you this.

384
00:21:53,659 --> 00:21:57,288
I love it.
It's that calligraphy kind, isn't it?

385
00:21:57,363 --> 00:21:59,228
I don't know. I don't like those letters.

386
00:21:59,298 --> 00:22:01,994
To me they look like crushed insects,
you know?

387
00:22:02,067 --> 00:22:04,092
What do we need
wedding invitations for, anyway?

388
00:22:04,169 --> 00:22:05,534
They should call people on the phone.

389
00:22:05,604 --> 00:22:08,198
Want to go to a wedding? Yeah?
Then get married.

390
00:22:08,273 --> 00:22:10,468
Chester, you're wrong.
When you get married,

391
00:22:10,542 --> 00:22:13,477
what's more important
than a beautiful wedding invitation?

392
00:22:13,545 --> 00:22:15,570
- Getting off.
- Getting off.

393
00:22:15,648 --> 00:22:17,047
Getting off.

394
00:22:18,984 --> 00:22:20,349
Chester, are you all right?

395
00:22:20,919 --> 00:22:23,285
Yeah, I'm just under a lot of pressure,
that's all.

396
00:22:23,355 --> 00:22:26,950
Yeah, me, too.
Chester, I'm worried about Matthew.

397
00:22:27,059 --> 00:22:28,583
I got a call from his principal.

398
00:22:28,661 --> 00:22:30,720
He hasn't turned in any homework
for two weeks.

399
00:22:30,796 --> 00:22:32,661
All he cares about is sports.

400
00:22:32,731 --> 00:22:34,756
Honey, I told you before,
Matthew needs discipline.

401
00:22:34,833 --> 00:22:37,165
I've seen the way you punish him.
You send him to his room.

402
00:22:37,236 --> 00:22:40,205
In his room he has a stereo, color TV,
Nintendo games.

403
00:22:40,272 --> 00:22:41,671
Oh, he really suffers.

404
00:22:43,342 --> 00:22:46,175
Wedding invitations.
Who's getting married?

405
00:22:46,311 --> 00:22:50,441
- We are.
- Well, good for you.

406
00:22:51,083 --> 00:22:53,881
I give you both a lot of credit.

407
00:22:54,253 --> 00:22:56,619
Hold your heads up high.

408
00:22:57,456 --> 00:23:01,051
You can't beat true love.
Have lots of babies.

409
00:23:01,427 --> 00:23:04,157
We're all God's children.

410
00:23:06,532 --> 00:23:08,329
Wonder what the kids would look like.

411
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,994
Come on. Get out of here, will you?
Come on, Bess, will you?

412
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:12,162
This is ridiculous.

413
00:23:12,237 --> 00:23:14,296
Well, this is it, honey.
I got to get down to the field.

414
00:23:14,373 --> 00:23:16,807
And don't worry about Matthew.
Things will get better.

415
00:23:16,875 --> 00:23:19,673
Well, they can't get much worse.
Because of his poor grades,

416
00:23:19,745 --> 00:23:22,213
they kicked him off JV football
and soccer.

417
00:23:22,314 --> 00:23:24,305
They kicked him off the soccer team?
They're nuts.

418
00:23:24,383 --> 00:23:27,409
- He's the best player they have.
- He's very depressed about it.

419
00:23:27,486 --> 00:23:29,852
Chester, maybe it would help
if you spent some time with him

420
00:23:29,922 --> 00:23:31,321
and talked to him about it.

421
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:32,880
I told you, don't worry about Matthew.

422
00:23:32,958 --> 00:23:35,153
They'll take him back. They need him.
He's a natural.

423
00:23:35,227 --> 00:23:37,286
He could teach me about soccer.

424
00:23:37,362 --> 00:23:39,796
Well, something has to be done.
I just wish I knew what.

425
00:23:42,267 --> 00:23:45,498
Bess, I'll tell you what.
I'll make time. I'll talk to him.

426
00:23:45,571 --> 00:23:47,095
Honey, would you?

427
00:23:47,172 --> 00:23:50,335
Bess, I promise you.
I'll definitely talk to him.

428
00:23:50,409 --> 00:23:53,003
Chester, you're a dear.

429
00:23:53,612 --> 00:23:55,876
A dear? More like a fox.

430
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:03,747
- There she is.
- Well, go ahead. Talk to her.

431
00:24:03,822 --> 00:24:05,915
No. I can't, Paul.
I don't even know what to say.

432
00:24:05,991 --> 00:24:07,891
Flatter her. Girls like that.

433
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:11,554
Tell her you love her eyes,
her lips, her hair,

434
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:13,393
the way she parts her hair.

435
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:15,999
In fact, tell her you love all her parts.

436
00:24:16,068 --> 00:24:18,502
No, I can't say that. No, no, no.

437
00:24:20,239 --> 00:24:23,072
So you can forget it, Paul,
'cause it's not going to happen.

438
00:24:23,142 --> 00:24:27,670
- All right, all right.
- Hey, Matthew, go long.

439
00:24:32,017 --> 00:24:33,245
Farther!

440
00:24:39,792 --> 00:24:41,191
Nice catch.

441
00:24:43,028 --> 00:24:44,222
Thanks.

442
00:24:50,969 --> 00:24:52,903
Hello. Excuse me.

443
00:24:53,438 --> 00:24:56,771
Hey, Matthew, jump in the car.
I gotta talk to you.

444
00:24:57,242 --> 00:24:58,607
No, thanks.

445
00:24:58,944 --> 00:25:02,402
Matthew, your mother wants me
to talk to you. Come on, get in the car.

446
00:25:02,481 --> 00:25:05,473
- I said, thanks anyway.
- Matthew, this is ridiculous.

447
00:25:05,551 --> 00:25:07,018
Come on, get in the car.

448
00:25:07,085 --> 00:25:10,350
Look, I don't want to get in your car,
so stop following me.

449
00:25:10,422 --> 00:25:11,650
Matthew!

450
00:25:12,257 --> 00:25:15,488
- Hi, Mrs. Yollick.
- Are you all right, Matthew?

451
00:25:15,861 --> 00:25:18,921
- Who is that man?
- Oh, yeah, I'm fine, Mrs. Yollick.

452
00:25:18,997 --> 00:25:20,760
He's not a stranger.

453
00:25:21,567 --> 00:25:22,829
He's just strange.

454
00:25:24,903 --> 00:25:26,871
Okay, Chesterfield, what do you want?

455
00:25:27,306 --> 00:25:30,400
Zigzag, zigzag.
No, zigzag like this, you know.

456
00:25:30,909 --> 00:25:33,571
- Kick, turn, kick, turn, kick, turn.
- Like this?

457
00:25:33,645 --> 00:25:36,045
Got it? Got it? No, wait, girls. No, wait.
Girl, girl!

458
00:25:36,114 --> 00:25:40,073
No, don't do it like me. No, don't do it
like me! No, don't do it just like me!

459
00:25:40,152 --> 00:25:42,643
Get the ball. Get the ball.

460
00:25:42,721 --> 00:25:43,949
Oh, God.

461
00:25:45,357 --> 00:25:48,690
Matthew, you have to do something
about your grades.

462
00:25:48,861 --> 00:25:51,728
That's why your mother asked me
to come out here and talk to you.

463
00:25:51,797 --> 00:25:53,788
I mean, the way you're going,

464
00:25:55,167 --> 00:25:57,101
you'll never get into college.

465
00:25:57,469 --> 00:26:00,302
I mean, I went through the same thing
when I was a kid.

466
00:26:00,372 --> 00:26:02,067
I remember the words of my mother.

467
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:03,471
She looked at me, she said,

468
00:26:03,542 --> 00:26:06,511
"College is important
and I have to scrub floors."

469
00:26:06,612 --> 00:26:09,376
And she went out for six years,
she scrubbed floors.

470
00:26:09,448 --> 00:26:11,416
And then she went to college.

471
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:15,313
I mean, Matthew,
you got to think of your future.

472
00:26:15,454 --> 00:26:17,922
Okay, Chesterfield,
thanks for the lecture.

473
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:19,651
I get the message.

474
00:26:20,292 --> 00:26:22,954
Before we go home,
I want to ask you something.

475
00:26:23,061 --> 00:26:25,996
It's not Halloween.
What's with the outfit?

476
00:26:27,232 --> 00:26:30,395
I'll explain this later.
But first, Matthew, look,

477
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:34,634
I want to ask you to do me a favor,
all right?

478
00:26:34,706 --> 00:26:36,173
That figures.

479
00:26:37,142 --> 00:26:39,042
You didn't come out here to help me.

480
00:26:39,111 --> 00:26:41,204
You came out here
for something that you want.

481
00:26:48,387 --> 00:26:50,617
Matthew, I need your help.

482
00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:53,583
I know we don't have
much of a relationship,

483
00:26:53,659 --> 00:26:55,991
but there's no one else
who can help me.

484
00:26:56,561 --> 00:26:58,119
Look, I'll level with you.

485
00:26:58,196 --> 00:27:01,563
You know the promotion I got at work?
I never got it.

486
00:27:01,967 --> 00:27:05,801
Your mother thinks I got it.
I just can't tell her the truth.

487
00:27:06,104 --> 00:27:08,538
Matthew, I'm coaching
a girl's soccer team,

488
00:27:08,607 --> 00:27:11,201
sponsored by my company,
the Ladybugs.

489
00:27:11,877 --> 00:27:14,243
Come on. You? I don't believe it.

490
00:27:14,313 --> 00:27:16,781
It's the truth.
That's why I'm wearing this outfit.

491
00:27:16,848 --> 00:27:19,214
If I can bring home a winning team,
I'll get that promotion.

492
00:27:19,284 --> 00:27:21,013
Then your mother and I can get married.

493
00:27:21,086 --> 00:27:22,553
Matthew, you can help me.

494
00:27:22,621 --> 00:27:25,215
This is where they practice.
I want you to look at them.

495
00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:28,225
Tell me what they're doing wrong.
Tell me what I'm doing wrong.

496
00:27:30,295 --> 00:27:32,456
Well, let me think about it, Chester.

497
00:27:32,531 --> 00:27:34,692
We're doing great already.

498
00:27:34,766 --> 00:27:36,631
You called me Chester
and not Chesterfield.

499
00:27:36,702 --> 00:27:39,603
- Chester!
- I got to go. They're waiting for me.

500
00:27:39,671 --> 00:27:42,606
Matthew, look at them.
I'll be back in a few minutes.

501
00:27:42,674 --> 00:27:44,164
Think it over, will you?

502
00:27:52,718 --> 00:27:55,778
Try and control the ball!
Try and control the ball!

503
00:27:57,923 --> 00:28:00,517
Forget the ball.
Try and stay on your feet!

504
00:28:01,159 --> 00:28:03,457
Get out of the net. You're not a fish.

505
00:28:08,967 --> 00:28:11,697
Pester! You're in a different time zone!

506
00:28:12,671 --> 00:28:14,070
Wait, wait.

507
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,231
Oh, beautiful, beautiful!

508
00:28:19,878 --> 00:28:21,778
Why me? Why me?

509
00:28:24,916 --> 00:28:27,077
Look, Kimberly.
You're doing that wonderfully.

510
00:28:29,221 --> 00:28:31,849
You can hit it a little harder.
I mean, kick it, kick it, kick.

511
00:29:55,407 --> 00:29:57,500
Heads up. Heads up, heads up!

512
00:29:57,576 --> 00:29:59,407
Could you throw the ball back, please?

513
00:30:01,913 --> 00:30:05,610
Line up, line up.
Kimberly, move on back!

514
00:30:05,684 --> 00:30:06,878
Thanks.

515
00:30:08,086 --> 00:30:09,246
Julie.

516
00:30:09,788 --> 00:30:11,551
Julie, could we do it again?

517
00:30:11,623 --> 00:30:13,682
Go, go! Line them up! Line them up!

518
00:30:13,758 --> 00:30:15,521
One, two, one, two.

519
00:30:21,967 --> 00:30:24,094
Now I can chase the butterflies?

520
00:30:24,169 --> 00:30:26,865
- Did you look at them?
- Yeah, I looked at them.

521
00:30:27,672 --> 00:30:30,197
- Well, what do you think?
- What do I think?

522
00:30:31,176 --> 00:30:33,303
I think I'd better come down
and watch some more.

523
00:30:33,378 --> 00:30:36,108
Great. Look, from what you saw today,

524
00:30:36,181 --> 00:30:37,842
can you give me some pointers?

525
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:40,518
Well, first of all, you have no strategy.

526
00:30:40,585 --> 00:30:42,485
Your players need to learn
some basic skills.

527
00:30:42,554 --> 00:30:45,489
Put your faster runners up front
and your offense will be more effective.

528
00:30:45,557 --> 00:30:47,957
Now, if I were playing,
what I would do is play center midfield

529
00:30:48,026 --> 00:30:52,087
so I could control the flow of the game,
and help out the inexperienced players.

530
00:30:52,164 --> 00:30:54,564
That's what I would do if I was playing.

531
00:30:58,503 --> 00:31:01,063
What? Why are you looking at me
like that?

532
00:31:01,506 --> 00:31:04,703
Oh, no. No way. No way, Chester.
It'll never happen.

533
00:31:04,776 --> 00:31:06,971
No, you're crazy, Chester,
it'll never happen!

534
00:31:07,045 --> 00:31:08,569
It'll never happen! No!

535
00:31:08,647 --> 00:31:11,707
All right, girls,
meet our new Ladybug, Martha.

536
00:31:11,783 --> 00:31:14,217
- Hi, Martha.
- Hi, Martha.

537
00:31:15,253 --> 00:31:17,517
Hey, you're a hit already.

538
00:31:17,589 --> 00:31:20,581
All right, now, girls,
this is our first game out of town.

539
00:31:20,659 --> 00:31:23,253
- Let's go out there and show them, huh?
- All right. Yeah!

540
00:31:23,328 --> 00:31:24,852
Get out there.

541
00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:28,997
- Hi, I'm Kimberly.
- Well, hi, I'm...

542
00:31:29,467 --> 00:31:30,661
Martha.

543
00:31:31,102 --> 00:31:33,400
- Martha.
- Hi.

544
00:31:34,506 --> 00:31:35,666
Hi.

545
00:31:38,877 --> 00:31:42,472
American coin.
Heads or tails, call it in the air.

546
00:31:42,547 --> 00:31:43,707
Heads.

547
00:31:44,849 --> 00:31:48,012
Heads it is. Kickoff or end of field?

548
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:50,820
- Kickoff.
- Are you the captain?

549
00:31:51,223 --> 00:31:52,884
Just cool it and kick off, sweetheart.

550
00:32:00,198 --> 00:32:02,189
Oh, God, give me a break.

551
00:32:02,734 --> 00:32:06,636
I got to get the promotion.
I want to marry Bess. Let us win.

552
00:32:06,738 --> 00:32:09,866
God, I promise I'll behave myself.
I'll lose weight.

553
00:32:09,941 --> 00:32:12,842
I'll never cheat my taxes.
I'll never curse in traffic.

554
00:32:12,911 --> 00:32:16,210
I'll never look at another woman
for too long.

555
00:32:16,615 --> 00:32:18,242
God, I'm not a bad guy.

556
00:32:20,752 --> 00:32:22,811
- Pass me the ball. I'm open.
- Out of the way.

557
00:32:22,887 --> 00:32:24,514
Give Welfelt the ball!

558
00:32:24,589 --> 00:32:26,523
Come on, I'm open.

559
00:32:27,859 --> 00:32:29,451
Come on.

560
00:32:31,696 --> 00:32:33,857
Pass to me, I'm open!

561
00:32:43,575 --> 00:32:46,510
Hey, God, I take it all back.
I may not need you.

562
00:32:47,379 --> 00:32:50,371
Defense! Oh, Jesus, fellas, you suck.

563
00:32:51,316 --> 00:32:55,082
Oh, Jesus. Hey, Welfelt,
you sissy priss, wake up! Hello!

564
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:57,888
What are you doing in the
middle defense? Come on, guys.

565
00:32:57,956 --> 00:33:00,322
Move your butt, Larimer!
What are you doing?

566
00:33:01,192 --> 00:33:04,684
Come on, wake up!
Defense! Defense! Chu!

567
00:33:07,966 --> 00:33:09,331
Oh, my God!

568
00:33:09,701 --> 00:33:12,602
Well, he's playing like a psycho.
He's nuts.

569
00:33:12,671 --> 00:33:15,367
Looks like Norman Bates
is playing soccer.

570
00:33:16,541 --> 00:33:18,907
After the game, no showers.

571
00:33:19,978 --> 00:33:22,572
And you call those girls a team?
They're a bunch of jerks.

572
00:33:22,647 --> 00:33:25,309
We're going to have to make
a lot of changes before the next game.

573
00:33:25,383 --> 00:33:27,908
You're right. And they're all about you.

574
00:33:28,653 --> 00:33:31,019
You gave no one else a chance to play.

575
00:33:31,089 --> 00:33:33,455
Look, I don't want you to win.
I want the team to win.

576
00:33:33,525 --> 00:33:35,925
Matthew, you got to change
your style of playing.

577
00:33:35,994 --> 00:33:38,588
If we're going to be a winning team,
there's got to be harmony.

578
00:33:38,663 --> 00:33:40,688
All the girls got to like each other.

579
00:33:40,765 --> 00:33:43,893
And right now,
the girls are not too fond of Martha.

580
00:33:43,968 --> 00:33:47,233
- You got to change your behavior.
- Oh, and what did I do?

581
00:33:47,539 --> 00:33:49,166
What did you do?

582
00:33:50,842 --> 00:33:52,104
What did you do?

583
00:33:52,177 --> 00:33:54,372
A girl doesn't give
the opposing team the finger

584
00:33:54,446 --> 00:33:56,175
and tell their coach "up yours."

585
00:33:56,247 --> 00:33:59,216
A girl doesn't refer to the referee
as a blind bastard.

586
00:33:59,284 --> 00:34:03,220
A girl doesn't slap another girl
on the ass and say, "You're hot stuff."

587
00:34:03,321 --> 00:34:04,481
And a girl doesn't say,

588
00:34:04,556 --> 00:34:07,116
"I got to take a leak so bad
I can taste it."

589
00:34:07,392 --> 00:34:09,952
Matthew, you have to start
acting like a young lady.

590
00:34:10,028 --> 00:34:12,360
Then go find yourself a young lady.

591
00:34:12,464 --> 00:34:15,865
I don't know how you talked me
into this anyway. It's all over, I quit.

592
00:34:15,934 --> 00:34:18,664
Matthew, we had a deal.
Don't let me down.

593
00:34:18,737 --> 00:34:22,195
It's only for a few months till
I get the promotion. You got to do it.

594
00:34:22,273 --> 00:34:24,571
Don't tell me what to do.
You're not my father!

595
00:34:24,642 --> 00:34:26,735
I told you it's all over, I quit!

596
00:34:30,181 --> 00:34:33,344
The next time you jump out of a car,
make sure it's moving!

597
00:34:50,301 --> 00:34:52,201
Hi, honey.
Dinner will be ready in a few minutes.

598
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:54,670
That's all right. I'm not hungry anyway.

599
00:34:55,607 --> 00:34:58,508
What kind of kiss was that?
What am I, your sister?

600
00:34:58,576 --> 00:35:00,737
I'm sorry. I got things on my mind.

601
00:35:01,312 --> 00:35:03,439
Well, did you talk to Matthew yet?

602
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:08,014
I don't know if it's right for me
to talk to him.

603
00:35:08,086 --> 00:35:09,781
Matthew won't listen to me.

604
00:35:09,854 --> 00:35:12,687
I mean, I'm not the smartest guy
in the world. Maybe he's right.

605
00:35:12,757 --> 00:35:14,281
These things take time.

606
00:35:14,359 --> 00:35:16,293
I'm sure it'll be better
after we're married.

607
00:35:16,361 --> 00:35:19,262
That's another thing, getting married.
You know, I...

608
00:35:19,330 --> 00:35:21,798
The day you came to the office
with the wedding invitations,

609
00:35:21,866 --> 00:35:24,926
the way I acted wasn't nice.
There was a reason for it.

610
00:35:25,737 --> 00:35:29,639
- And the reason is...
- Chester, no. Honey, it was my fault.

611
00:35:29,707 --> 00:35:32,267
With everything that's going on,
you have so much on your mind.

612
00:35:32,343 --> 00:35:34,607
I shouldn't have bothered you
with wedding invitations.

613
00:35:34,679 --> 00:35:38,012
Chester, I'm so happy. I love you.

614
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:41,180
It's just that I'm so excited.

615
00:35:41,286 --> 00:35:43,413
Bess, you know, sometimes in life,

616
00:35:44,088 --> 00:35:47,251
to get what you want, you know,
you do things you're not proud of.

617
00:35:47,325 --> 00:35:49,885
Sometimes you get trapped,
you have to lie.

618
00:35:49,961 --> 00:35:52,725
Chester, you're confusing me.
What are you trying to say?

619
00:35:53,832 --> 00:35:57,461
It's not that confusing. What I want
to tell you is I didn't get the...

620
00:35:57,535 --> 00:36:00,561
- Hey, I'm starving. Where's dinner?
- Matthew, honey, I'm sorry.

621
00:36:00,638 --> 00:36:04,074
- It's almost done.
- All right, Chester, how you doing?

622
00:36:04,509 --> 00:36:05,737
Hey, Mom, guess what?

623
00:36:05,810 --> 00:36:07,835
I'm going to be joining
a new soccer team.

624
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:12,639
The coach is a really nice guy,
once you get to know him.

625
00:36:14,719 --> 00:36:17,313
Everything's going to work out
just great.

626
00:36:17,856 --> 00:36:21,053
Matthew, I told you before,
you got to act like a lady.

627
00:36:21,192 --> 00:36:24,127
You have to be considerate,
loving, giving...

628
00:36:24,195 --> 00:36:25,389
Taking.

629
00:36:26,397 --> 00:36:29,628
And, Matthew, with boys,
as a young lady, you always say no.

630
00:36:29,701 --> 00:36:31,362
Now, wait a minute now,
you don't always say no!

631
00:36:31,436 --> 00:36:33,097
If the mood is right
and you having a few drinks,

632
00:36:33,171 --> 00:36:34,365
and some handsome man
comes up to you,

633
00:36:34,439 --> 00:36:35,633
you eyeing him, he's eyeing you,

634
00:36:35,707 --> 00:36:37,299
the music is on,
you both want to do your thing,

635
00:36:37,375 --> 00:36:38,808
you say no, you got to be crazy!

636
00:36:38,877 --> 00:36:41,971
Julie, I didn't bring you here to tell
the kid when to make out, all right?

637
00:36:42,046 --> 00:36:44,071
Suppose he has a gold card
or new Porsche, or something.

638
00:36:44,148 --> 00:36:45,240
You gonna say no? No!

639
00:36:45,316 --> 00:36:47,978
Julie, I'll work it out.
Go buy the kid some earrings, will you?

640
00:36:48,052 --> 00:36:50,577
I lost out on a trip to Hawaii one time
saying no.

641
00:36:50,788 --> 00:36:54,280
Matthew, just remember,
a lady is sensitive, she's tender.

642
00:36:54,359 --> 00:36:57,851
Look at it this way. Women are like
a beautiful bed of flowers.

643
00:36:59,531 --> 00:37:01,795
Of course,
there's a weed here and there.

644
00:37:06,004 --> 00:37:07,403
Hi, can I help you?

645
00:37:07,472 --> 00:37:10,270
Yeah, I'd like to see a nice dress
for a young lady.

646
00:37:10,341 --> 00:37:11,968
And what size is she?

647
00:37:12,911 --> 00:37:14,572
I don't know. What size are you?

648
00:37:16,581 --> 00:37:19,482
Well, actually, it's for his twin sister.
They're the same size.

649
00:37:22,186 --> 00:37:25,678
We have a lovely print we just got in.
It's right here.

650
00:37:26,558 --> 00:37:28,788
I think this would be the right size.

651
00:37:29,227 --> 00:37:30,558
Well, I'd like him to try it on,

652
00:37:30,628 --> 00:37:33,756
I'd like to see what it'll look like
on his twin sister.

653
00:37:34,299 --> 00:37:36,995
We have a dressing room
right over here.

654
00:37:40,738 --> 00:37:43,172
- And I'll be around if you need me.
- Okay.

655
00:38:05,597 --> 00:38:07,326
Chester, come here.

656
00:38:09,233 --> 00:38:11,258
Chester, there's a zipper
in the back of this dress.

657
00:38:11,336 --> 00:38:12,894
You got to help me.

658
00:38:16,975 --> 00:38:18,602
All right, now turn around.
I'll put the wig on.

659
00:38:18,676 --> 00:38:20,337
- All right.
- Come on.

660
00:38:20,411 --> 00:38:22,606
I'm sorry,
but the dressing room is occupied.

661
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:25,649
If you have a seat right over there,
I'll have your dress here for you.

662
00:38:25,717 --> 00:38:27,048
Thank you.

663
00:38:27,185 --> 00:38:29,551
Isn't that a pretty dress?

664
00:38:29,687 --> 00:38:31,814
Just remember, we got to be careful.

665
00:38:31,889 --> 00:38:34,858
I don't want your mother to find out.
She'll kill me.

666
00:38:36,494 --> 00:38:40,624
- God, I can't believe I'm doing this.
- Don't worry. I'll be finished soon.

667
00:38:43,835 --> 00:38:45,496
Take it easy. That hurts.

668
00:38:47,472 --> 00:38:50,703
All right, don't worry.
If it's too tight, you'll get used to it.

669
00:39:00,885 --> 00:39:03,115
Well, what a cute little girl.

670
00:39:03,221 --> 00:39:05,052
And what's your name?

671
00:39:08,693 --> 00:39:12,459
All right, you look like a young lady.
Now you have to act like one.

672
00:39:43,428 --> 00:39:46,261
She's in training.
Friday night, she's an underdog.

673
00:39:46,664 --> 00:39:49,599
You got to work on your jab, your hook
and your slip is showing.

674
00:39:49,667 --> 00:39:53,626
Come on, will you? You keep this up,
your next fight will be with me.

675
00:39:56,374 --> 00:39:58,171
You have to go to the bathroom,
go ahead.

676
00:39:58,242 --> 00:40:00,107
Look at me. How can I?

677
00:40:02,013 --> 00:40:04,709
- Can you wait till you get home?
- No way.

678
00:40:05,850 --> 00:40:07,044
- Use the ladies' room.
- I can't.

679
00:40:07,118 --> 00:40:09,109
Suppose there's women in there?

680
00:40:12,490 --> 00:40:16,187
Anybody in here? The mall's on fire.
Mall's on fire.

681
00:40:18,196 --> 00:40:20,323
Go ahead. I'll watch out for you.

682
00:40:29,307 --> 00:40:32,140
I guess he couldn't wait
till he got home, either.

683
00:40:37,849 --> 00:40:40,477
What's taking you so long?
You're a young kid.

684
00:40:45,690 --> 00:40:48,955
You got the wrong place, lady.
It's the men's room.

685
00:40:49,026 --> 00:40:52,086
Oh, dear, it's the other door.

686
00:40:53,931 --> 00:40:57,196
- I almost walked into the men's room.
- Almost.

687
00:41:00,338 --> 00:41:02,636
Come on, let's get out of here.

688
00:41:05,343 --> 00:41:08,073
She probably saw something
she never sees at home.

689
00:41:08,646 --> 00:41:10,705
This game is a big one
for me today, Julie.

690
00:41:10,782 --> 00:41:12,613
- Mullen's going to be here.
- You are right, Chester.

691
00:41:12,683 --> 00:41:13,945
You don't know how right you are.

692
00:41:14,018 --> 00:41:15,883
In fact,
he's walking towards you right now.

693
00:41:15,953 --> 00:41:18,547
Well, I'll see you.
I got to go check out the girls.

694
00:41:18,623 --> 00:41:21,319
- Chester.
- Mr. Mullen, how are you?

695
00:41:21,459 --> 00:41:24,326
You know,
I remember our last conversation.

696
00:41:24,395 --> 00:41:27,364
I know you wanted a winning team,
you know, but it just takes time.

697
00:41:27,431 --> 00:41:30,298
I mean, don't be angry. It'll work out.
They're getting better.

698
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:32,302
I mean, you know how girls are.

699
00:41:32,370 --> 00:41:34,770
They never come through right away,
you know.

700
00:41:35,506 --> 00:41:39,067
Chester, take it easy, slow down.
You've got it all wrong.

701
00:41:39,143 --> 00:41:42,909
You've made terrific progress.
You almost won the last game.

702
00:41:43,281 --> 00:41:46,182
- My wife and I are very pleased.
- Really?

703
00:41:46,417 --> 00:41:48,009
Of course we are. Are you kidding?

704
00:41:48,085 --> 00:41:50,076
And this new girl
you've got on the team, Martha.

705
00:41:50,154 --> 00:41:52,349
- I hear she's great.
- She is, she is.

706
00:41:52,423 --> 00:41:54,914
She's really something different,
you know.

707
00:41:55,827 --> 00:41:58,921
I'll tell you.
I'm happy you feel that way, Mr. Mullen.

708
00:41:58,996 --> 00:42:01,396
Chester, call me Dave.

709
00:42:02,466 --> 00:42:04,798
- Okay, Dave.
- Chester, you keep up the good work,

710
00:42:04,869 --> 00:42:07,702
this time next year,
you'll have 10 men under you.

711
00:42:08,306 --> 00:42:10,399
Dave, can you make it women?

712
00:42:11,809 --> 00:42:13,208
Chester.

713
00:42:13,411 --> 00:42:16,744
- I'm looking for Coach Chester.
- Yeah. Right here.

714
00:42:16,848 --> 00:42:21,444
Well, I'm Coach Annie with the Beavers,
and so far this year, we're undefeated.

715
00:42:21,519 --> 00:42:25,717
And I heard about your team.
So far this year, you've lost two.

716
00:42:25,790 --> 00:42:28,156
Well, Coach Chester,

717
00:42:28,426 --> 00:42:31,589
make ready to make it number three.

718
00:42:31,929 --> 00:42:34,193
You're pretty sure of yourself,
aren't you?

719
00:42:34,265 --> 00:42:37,291
Yeah, well I know what my girls can do.

720
00:42:37,401 --> 00:42:39,528
And I just want to tell you

721
00:42:39,937 --> 00:42:44,340
that your team is going to get crushed.

722
00:42:44,442 --> 00:42:46,501
I guess you're going to play, too, huh?

723
00:42:50,615 --> 00:42:53,277
I'll tell you one thing,
she's not two-faced.

724
00:42:53,351 --> 00:42:55,182
If she was,
she'd wear the other one, huh?

725
00:42:55,253 --> 00:42:58,484
The Ladybugs are losers, Chester,

726
00:42:58,589 --> 00:43:01,251
'cause you're a loser!

727
00:43:02,293 --> 00:43:03,692
What a lady.

728
00:43:03,828 --> 00:43:07,229
Boy, when she walks in the room,
mice jump on chairs.

729
00:43:08,332 --> 00:43:11,597
At Christmas,
they hang her and kiss the mistletoe.

730
00:43:12,737 --> 00:43:16,036
I tell you, if she went to a dog show,
she'd win.

731
00:43:17,808 --> 00:43:20,538
- Chester, good luck.
- Okay, Mr. Mullen.

732
00:43:20,678 --> 00:43:21,736
- Chester.
- Yeah?

733
00:43:21,812 --> 00:43:24,178
Martha gave me this. Take a look at it.

734
00:43:24,282 --> 00:43:27,149
What? She put Chu at center,
Heape at goalie.

735
00:43:27,218 --> 00:43:29,846
Why, she changed around
all the positions here.

736
00:43:29,921 --> 00:43:32,651
Martha thinks
they'll be more effective this way.

737
00:43:32,723 --> 00:43:34,088
Well, it's okay with me.

738
00:43:34,158 --> 00:43:37,184
I mean, I'm used to having women
tell me what to do.

739
00:43:40,631 --> 00:43:43,429
We're going to win this one.
Get ready for it.

740
00:43:45,569 --> 00:43:47,059
Chu, the ball.

741
00:43:55,212 --> 00:43:56,679
Come on, go for it.

742
00:43:59,016 --> 00:44:01,280
Okay, get ready.
I'm going to kick it to you.

743
00:44:02,753 --> 00:44:04,448
Chu! All right.

744
00:44:04,522 --> 00:44:07,184
Look at those pretty butterflies, Chu.
There you go. Okay.

745
00:44:07,258 --> 00:44:08,657
Good, now keep it going.

746
00:44:08,726 --> 00:44:11,388
We're going to crush you, Chester!

747
00:44:12,029 --> 00:44:15,624
Crush those bugs! Crush those bugs!

748
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:19,227
Trap those beavers!
Trap those beavers!

749
00:44:19,303 --> 00:44:22,101
Okay, you're doing good.
Okay, keep your eye on the ball.

750
00:44:22,173 --> 00:44:23,435
Come on, come on, fight!

751
00:44:23,507 --> 00:44:26,374
Yeah!

752
00:44:26,444 --> 00:44:30,210
- That's our girl, Chu!
- Chu! Chu!

753
00:44:31,749 --> 00:44:35,981
What, are you celebrating or sneezing?
Julie, everything's working out great.

754
00:44:36,053 --> 00:44:38,419
Martha's behaving herself.
Mullen is happy as...

755
00:44:38,489 --> 00:44:39,922
- Chester.
- Hey, Bess.

756
00:44:39,991 --> 00:44:43,483
I was just telling Julie
everything is working out perfectly.

757
00:44:43,561 --> 00:44:45,358
I thought you were working.

758
00:44:45,563 --> 00:44:46,996
Well, I'm on my lunch hour.

759
00:44:47,064 --> 00:44:49,157
I wanted to watch some of the game
but I can't stay long.

760
00:44:49,233 --> 00:44:52,202
- Good. I'll walk you to your car.
- No. I can stay for a little while.

761
00:44:52,269 --> 00:44:54,237
- Can I sit over here?
- Over here?

762
00:44:54,305 --> 00:44:56,102
- Martha!
- It's coming to you!

763
00:44:56,173 --> 00:44:58,368
No, no, no. You come with me.
I'll get you a better seat.

764
00:44:58,442 --> 00:45:00,069
- Come with me, will you?
- Get ready.

765
00:45:01,746 --> 00:45:03,270
All the way! All the way!

766
00:45:03,347 --> 00:45:05,178
Go! Go! Go!

767
00:45:05,249 --> 00:45:08,184
- Here you are, honey. Sit right here.
- This is a better seat?

768
00:45:08,252 --> 00:45:10,220
Are you kidding?
This is the best seat in the house.

769
00:45:10,287 --> 00:45:12,915
You can see the whole field.
You don't miss any action.

770
00:45:12,990 --> 00:45:16,824
You get the whole perspective.
Go on, sit here. Go ahead, will you?

771
00:45:18,262 --> 00:45:19,752
- Larimer, get ready.
- Come on, come on.

772
00:45:19,964 --> 00:45:21,659
Okay, Bess, let's go.

773
00:45:21,732 --> 00:45:23,893
Let's go? I've hardly seen anything.

774
00:45:23,968 --> 00:45:25,595
Honey, it's the same thing
all over again.

775
00:45:25,669 --> 00:45:27,330
They kick the ball back and forth.

776
00:45:27,405 --> 00:45:29,635
Come on, you got to get back.
I don't want you to be late.

777
00:45:29,707 --> 00:45:32,540
I mean, I want you to quit your job,
not get fired. Now, come on.

778
00:45:36,747 --> 00:45:38,146
Here!

779
00:45:38,649 --> 00:45:41,516
Bess, did I tell you?
You look gorgeous today.

780
00:45:41,585 --> 00:45:43,348
Here. Me. I'm open here!

781
00:45:44,555 --> 00:45:45,886
Okay, come on. Let's go.

782
00:45:50,428 --> 00:45:52,692
- Come on, Pester.
- I don't want to. I'm scared.

783
00:45:52,763 --> 00:45:54,560
- Pester, come on.
- Jesus.

784
00:45:54,632 --> 00:45:55,963
It's a throw in.

785
00:45:56,033 --> 00:45:58,695
- Hey, what are you doing?
- I'm thinking of replacing Pester.

786
00:45:58,769 --> 00:46:00,634
I don't think she can make it.

787
00:46:00,704 --> 00:46:02,262
Come on.

788
00:46:02,339 --> 00:46:04,170
You don't want to leave the game,
do you, Pester?

789
00:46:06,744 --> 00:46:08,006
We need you out there.

790
00:46:12,083 --> 00:46:14,415
- I want to stay.
- Okay.

791
00:46:14,985 --> 00:46:16,748
She's in your hands.

792
00:46:17,521 --> 00:46:19,421
But not completely, you know.

793
00:46:22,159 --> 00:46:24,627
- Pester!
- Okay. Open your eyes, Pester.

794
00:46:24,695 --> 00:46:25,957
Open your eyes!

795
00:46:26,030 --> 00:46:29,193
You can do it. Don't be afraid, Pester,
okay? The ball ain't going to bite.

796
00:46:29,266 --> 00:46:30,631
All right.

797
00:46:31,435 --> 00:46:34,666
Okay, Pester. Eye on the ball.
Keep your eyes on the ball.

798
00:46:34,905 --> 00:46:37,237
Okay, now, pass it to Larimer. Go!

799
00:46:38,209 --> 00:46:40,268
- Larimer!
- Yes!

800
00:46:41,245 --> 00:46:42,439
Yes!

801
00:46:43,013 --> 00:46:46,176
Positively perfect pass play,
Penny Pester!

802
00:46:46,650 --> 00:46:49,813
What? Could you run that by me
one more time?

803
00:46:51,856 --> 00:46:54,222
All right, guys! All right, Martha!

804
00:46:54,291 --> 00:46:55,849
Come on, Kimberly.

805
00:46:59,063 --> 00:47:00,360
Kimberly.

806
00:47:01,966 --> 00:47:04,059
Don't worry about it, Kim.
We'll get them next time.

807
00:47:04,135 --> 00:47:06,399
You're a loser, Chester!

808
00:47:06,470 --> 00:47:08,700
Hey, Annie.
I want to take you to the zoo.

809
00:47:08,772 --> 00:47:10,899
Yeah, they'll thank me for returning you.

810
00:47:11,475 --> 00:47:12,908
Martha, over here!

811
00:47:16,747 --> 00:47:18,078
Are you okay?

812
00:47:18,716 --> 00:47:20,946
Wait! I'm a nurse, I'm a nurse!

813
00:47:21,285 --> 00:47:22,445
Wait, back off, please.

814
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:25,489
You poor dear! Show me where it hurts.

815
00:47:26,423 --> 00:47:29,415
If she shows where it hurts,
we'll need a nurse for her.

816
00:47:29,493 --> 00:47:32,018
Okay. Okay, I'm fine.

817
00:47:32,129 --> 00:47:34,256
What happened, Chester?
Was she hurt bad?

818
00:47:34,331 --> 00:47:35,491
All right.

819
00:47:36,167 --> 00:47:37,828
You have no idea.

820
00:47:40,404 --> 00:47:42,031
Wait, Kim. Don't move.

821
00:47:44,408 --> 00:47:45,670
Yeah!

822
00:47:45,876 --> 00:47:47,275
Yeah! All right!

823
00:47:54,151 --> 00:47:57,609
You have been cautioned.
Next time, you'll be sent off!

824
00:47:57,988 --> 00:47:59,580
Come on, Martha!

825
00:48:00,291 --> 00:48:01,758
Coming through here.

826
00:48:02,193 --> 00:48:03,785
Atta boy, Martha!

827
00:48:06,163 --> 00:48:07,892
Come on, come on, come on!

828
00:48:09,567 --> 00:48:10,864
Yes!

829
00:48:14,405 --> 00:48:16,532
Hey, Julie, that's one in a row.

830
00:48:18,576 --> 00:48:21,875
- You did it, Martha!
- Don't mess up my hair.

831
00:48:23,414 --> 00:48:27,544
Chester, you did it. You really did it.
That promotion's not too far away.

832
00:48:28,919 --> 00:48:30,352
Chester!

833
00:48:31,755 --> 00:48:33,188
You did it!

834
00:48:35,159 --> 00:48:37,127
All right! We did it, Chester!

835
00:48:37,795 --> 00:48:38,955
Yeah!

836
00:48:40,431 --> 00:48:41,625
I know!

837
00:48:41,799 --> 00:48:43,699
Great game, Chester.

838
00:48:45,269 --> 00:48:47,134
Great game, great game.

839
00:48:49,907 --> 00:48:54,003
- Chester, it feels great!
- Dave, you should know.

840
00:49:00,084 --> 00:49:03,247
You know, in case I haven't told you
lately, I'm very proud of you.

841
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:04,580
Yeah, thanks, honey.

842
00:49:04,655 --> 00:49:07,453
But we have a long way to go
to the championship.

843
00:49:08,325 --> 00:49:10,054
Bess, would you get that?

844
00:49:11,061 --> 00:49:12,494
Hello?

845
00:49:13,030 --> 00:49:15,260
Yeah, yeah, he's right here. Hold on.

846
00:49:15,532 --> 00:49:17,261
Chester, it's Martha.

847
00:49:21,472 --> 00:49:26,034
- Chester!
- I'm sorry, I thought I saw a raccoon.

848
00:49:28,312 --> 00:49:31,213
Martha, why are you calling me?

849
00:49:33,050 --> 00:49:35,245
Would you rather
I call my mother, Chester?

850
00:49:35,319 --> 00:49:37,947
No, no, no.

851
00:49:38,022 --> 00:49:40,422
Listen, Chester, I'm in big trouble.
I'm at the Mullen's house.

852
00:49:40,491 --> 00:49:42,584
Mrs. Mullen took all the girls
to her house after practice.

853
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:44,753
She insisted that I go with them.

854
00:49:45,195 --> 00:49:48,653
Just have your ice cream and cake
and go home.

855
00:49:49,066 --> 00:49:51,933
Listen, genius, if it was that simple,
I wouldn't have called you.

856
00:49:52,002 --> 00:49:55,438
- Martha, where are you?
- Martha, come out.

857
00:49:55,739 --> 00:49:56,933
Stop hiding, Martha.

858
00:49:57,007 --> 00:49:58,668
Now all the girls are
going skinny-dipping.

859
00:50:04,682 --> 00:50:08,277
I tell you, Bess,
those raccoons are all over the place.

860
00:50:09,253 --> 00:50:10,584
- Martha!
- Martha?

861
00:50:10,654 --> 00:50:11,746
Martha, where are you?

862
00:50:11,822 --> 00:50:13,653
Mrs. Mullen said
that none of the girls can leave

863
00:50:13,724 --> 00:50:15,351
unless their parents come
and pick them up.

864
00:50:15,426 --> 00:50:18,589
- Don't worry, Martha. It'll all work out.
- When?

865
00:50:18,929 --> 00:50:21,955
Well, good things happen
to little girls who are patient.

866
00:50:24,868 --> 00:50:26,802
Hang this up, will you, honey?

867
00:50:30,541 --> 00:50:33,305
- Nice and easy.
- Okay, Fred.

868
00:50:35,446 --> 00:50:36,879
That's good.

869
00:50:37,548 --> 00:50:39,015
I'll be back.

870
00:50:39,817 --> 00:50:42,547
You know,
I think I'm getting better, don't you?

871
00:50:55,933 --> 00:50:57,332
May I help you?

872
00:50:57,434 --> 00:51:00,335
Yes, I'm here to pick up
my daughter, Martha.

873
00:51:01,372 --> 00:51:04,034
Yes, of course. Just a moment, please.

874
00:51:04,108 --> 00:51:06,508
Martha! Martha, your mother's here.

875
00:51:06,577 --> 00:51:08,670
Would you please care to step in?

876
00:51:09,146 --> 00:51:12,206
No, thank you.
I'll be late for my bridge club.

877
00:51:12,683 --> 00:51:14,241
One of the girls left her shoes.

878
00:51:17,454 --> 00:51:18,887
Okay.

879
00:51:19,957 --> 00:51:22,187
Here you are.
Well, run along now, dear.

880
00:51:22,259 --> 00:51:23,419
Come on, dear.

881
00:51:23,494 --> 00:51:25,985
- It was very nice to have met you.
- Toodley-do.

882
00:51:30,067 --> 00:51:32,797
One word about this
and you'll never reach 15.

883
00:51:32,870 --> 00:51:35,668
Get in the car quick.
These heels are killing me!

884
00:52:30,127 --> 00:52:31,424
I'm getting it.

885
00:52:31,495 --> 00:52:33,122
Hey, Penny Pester.

886
00:52:33,297 --> 00:52:36,130
What are you doing here?
The girls are all over there.

887
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:38,225
What's the matter? Don't you like boys?

888
00:52:38,302 --> 00:52:41,703
Yeah, I do. But I don't think they like me.

889
00:52:42,706 --> 00:52:44,537
I'm not pretty like the other girls.

890
00:52:45,142 --> 00:52:46,734
Are you kidding?

891
00:52:47,945 --> 00:52:50,812
Why, you're one of the prettiest girls
on the team.

892
00:52:50,914 --> 00:52:53,178
Have you looked in the mirror lately?

893
00:52:53,617 --> 00:52:56,415
Hey, Julie, do me a favor.
You got your mirror with you?

894
00:52:58,121 --> 00:53:00,112
Thanks. Look, I'll meet you and Martha
by the car.

895
00:53:00,190 --> 00:53:02,249
Wait for me.
I'll be there in a few minutes.

896
00:53:02,326 --> 00:53:04,123
Look at this mirror, will you?

897
00:53:04,228 --> 00:53:06,162
You know, I've never seen you
with your hair down.

898
00:53:06,230 --> 00:53:08,255
Let me see what you look like
with your hair down.

899
00:53:08,332 --> 00:53:10,129
Okay, hold that thing here.

900
00:53:12,302 --> 00:53:13,735
What beautiful hair.

901
00:53:14,972 --> 00:53:17,236
Let me see you
with your glasses off, too, will you?

902
00:53:17,307 --> 00:53:19,172
Take your glasses off.

903
00:53:20,644 --> 00:53:24,102
Look at those brown eyes.
You're cute as a button.

904
00:53:28,018 --> 00:53:29,747
But what about my braces?

905
00:53:30,053 --> 00:53:31,953
So what? Big deal.

906
00:53:32,022 --> 00:53:33,922
You'll meet a boy who has braces.

907
00:53:33,991 --> 00:53:37,119
Then when you kiss, you'll see sparks.

908
00:53:38,629 --> 00:53:40,620
I'll tell you something, Penny Pester.

909
00:53:40,697 --> 00:53:44,098
If I was younger,
I would definitely ask you for a date

910
00:53:44,668 --> 00:53:47,660
and just my luck, you probably
wouldn't even go out with me.

911
00:53:47,738 --> 00:53:49,865
Yes, I would, Coach Chester.

912
00:53:52,743 --> 00:53:54,802
Come on,
get over there with those girls.

913
00:53:54,878 --> 00:53:56,641
Go ahead, will you?
Give those boys a break.

914
00:53:56,713 --> 00:53:58,271
Get over there.

915
00:54:01,885 --> 00:54:03,580
- Hi, Pester.
- Hi, Pester.

916
00:54:03,687 --> 00:54:04,915
- How are you doing?
- Hi, Pester.

917
00:54:07,824 --> 00:54:09,758
Watch it, guys. Just sit over there.

918
00:54:10,727 --> 00:54:12,194
Come on, guys, go!

919
00:54:13,397 --> 00:54:14,625
Great.

920
00:54:18,035 --> 00:54:19,502
Now watch Chu.

921
00:54:19,570 --> 00:54:21,834
- It's coming to you, Kim.
- I can't. You take it.

922
00:54:21,905 --> 00:54:24,066
Come on. Just do it! Believe me.

923
00:54:25,809 --> 00:54:27,504
Kimberly's got the ball.

924
00:54:40,691 --> 00:54:42,750
To hell with your parents. You'll get it.

925
00:54:46,129 --> 00:54:48,962
- Chester.
- I want Kimberly out of the game.

926
00:54:49,433 --> 00:54:52,960
Dave, give her a chance.
It was only one play.

927
00:54:53,036 --> 00:54:55,197
She's embarrassing me.

928
00:54:55,872 --> 00:54:58,534
Dave, if I take her out,
think of what she'll go through.

929
00:54:58,609 --> 00:54:59,837
I can't hurt her that way.

930
00:54:59,910 --> 00:55:02,572
Look, she's my kid.
I want her out of there.

931
00:55:04,448 --> 00:55:06,575
- But, Dave...
- Get her out!

932
00:55:13,023 --> 00:55:14,183
Kim.

933
00:55:18,929 --> 00:55:21,397
Kim, you're coming out.

934
00:55:26,870 --> 00:55:30,306
- Did he just tell you to bench Kim?
- Matthew, I had no choice.

935
00:55:30,374 --> 00:55:32,103
Look, we're one point away
from winning.

936
00:55:32,175 --> 00:55:33,574
Get back out there, will you?

937
00:55:52,262 --> 00:55:53,627
Velez!

938
00:55:54,831 --> 00:55:56,162
Chu!

939
00:55:57,701 --> 00:55:59,191
Larimer!

940
00:56:00,837 --> 00:56:02,327
Welfelt!

941
00:56:04,574 --> 00:56:06,007
Martha!

942
00:56:07,310 --> 00:56:08,902
Save this, sweetheart!

943
00:56:13,583 --> 00:56:16,848
Chester, you did it!
We're in the championship.

944
00:56:17,220 --> 00:56:19,211
You know a good decorator?

945
00:56:20,691 --> 00:56:24,457
There's a big office right next to mine
just waiting for a guy like you.

946
00:56:24,961 --> 00:56:27,429
And here comes our star player.

947
00:56:27,764 --> 00:56:29,459
Thanks to you, we won another one.

948
00:56:33,270 --> 00:56:35,363
Chester, you're going places.

949
00:56:35,439 --> 00:56:36,906
You're going to look good
in that big office.

950
00:56:36,973 --> 00:56:39,134
In fact, if things keep going
the way they're going,

951
00:56:39,209 --> 00:56:41,734
you could even become
a member of my country club.

952
00:56:42,612 --> 00:56:43,806
Thanks.

953
00:56:52,322 --> 00:56:54,381
Well, here it is.

954
00:56:54,458 --> 00:56:57,086
This is the house
the real estate lady told me about.

955
00:56:57,160 --> 00:57:00,596
Wow! Who lived here before,
the Addams family?

956
00:57:01,565 --> 00:57:05,296
She said it was a very good deal.
And look, honey, it's a two-story house.

957
00:57:05,368 --> 00:57:07,097
Two-story house, yeah.

958
00:57:07,304 --> 00:57:09,602
Before you buy it,
they give you one story.

959
00:57:09,673 --> 00:57:12,369
After you move in, you get another story.

960
00:57:13,343 --> 00:57:15,675
I never saw such beautiful landscaping.

961
00:57:15,746 --> 00:57:18,010
It looks like all the trees threw up.

962
00:57:18,081 --> 00:57:21,778
Come here. There's something else
I want to show you, too, over here.

963
00:57:22,319 --> 00:57:24,753
Look at this,
we're so close to the neighbors.

964
00:57:24,821 --> 00:57:26,789
I mean, if we start screaming,
they'll hear us.

965
00:57:26,857 --> 00:57:28,347
Chester, we never fight.

966
00:57:29,693 --> 00:57:31,593
Honey, I'm not talking about fighting.

967
00:57:32,629 --> 00:57:36,087
I'll tell you, with that house, you're lucky
if you can't find your way home.

968
00:57:36,166 --> 00:57:38,634
Look at that. Isn't that cute?

969
00:57:39,770 --> 00:57:43,331
Very cute.
All the kid sees is his father's behind.

970
00:57:43,573 --> 00:57:44,938
Later on, the kid grows up,

971
00:57:45,008 --> 00:57:47,977
he'll marry a guy named Ralph
and they'll wonder why.

972
00:57:52,549 --> 00:57:54,312
Yeah, just a minute!

973
00:58:01,358 --> 00:58:03,019
Holy shit!

974
00:58:22,946 --> 00:58:24,311
Pictures.

975
00:58:27,517 --> 00:58:28,711
Coming!

976
00:58:32,722 --> 00:58:35,088
- Kimberly. What a surprise.
- Hi, Martha.

977
00:58:35,392 --> 00:58:39,260
I hope you don't mind me dropping in.
Somebody told me where you lived.

978
00:58:39,696 --> 00:58:41,994
No. I don't mind at all. I was just

979
00:58:42,866 --> 00:58:44,026
watching some TV.

980
00:58:44,100 --> 00:58:45,897
Well, can I watch with you?

981
00:58:46,403 --> 00:58:49,338
- Okay. It's in the family room.
- Okay.

982
00:58:49,406 --> 00:58:51,931
Why don't you go in there
while I close the door.

983
00:58:52,008 --> 00:58:53,839
- Okay.
- Right.

984
00:59:02,619 --> 00:59:04,018
Kimberly, I'm really sorry

985
00:59:04,087 --> 00:59:05,714
about what happened
at the game today.

986
00:59:05,789 --> 00:59:07,017
Yeah, well.

987
00:59:07,090 --> 00:59:10,321
I thought being on my dad's team
would make us closer somehow.

988
00:59:10,393 --> 00:59:12,554
Well, that's a good idea.
That makes sense.

989
00:59:12,629 --> 00:59:15,120
Yeah, but it doesn't seem to be
working out.

990
00:59:15,198 --> 00:59:16,825
I guess
I'm just not good enough for him.

991
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:20,734
Well, Kimberly,
all kids get pressure from their parents.

992
00:59:21,071 --> 00:59:23,699
Don't worry about it.
Someday they'll grow up.

993
00:59:26,076 --> 00:59:28,601
Martha, you make me feel
so much better.

994
00:59:30,046 --> 00:59:33,072
- Thank you. You're my best friend.
- Okay. Okay, good.

995
00:59:37,420 --> 00:59:39,911
You know,
it's getting kind of hot in here.

996
00:59:40,490 --> 00:59:43,118
- How about some Cokes?
- I'll have a Coke. Yeah.

997
00:59:43,193 --> 00:59:44,592
Okay, okay.

998
00:59:44,661 --> 00:59:46,652
- I'll be right back.
- Okay, thanks.

999
00:59:59,109 --> 01:00:02,374
Yeah, from now on don't get behind
an old lady with coupons.

1000
01:00:13,857 --> 01:00:15,484
Yeah, I feel very manly.

1001
01:00:15,558 --> 01:00:18,186
For a half hour I was with a group
of women feeling tomatoes.

1002
01:00:20,830 --> 01:00:22,195
Hi, Mom, Chester.

1003
01:00:22,399 --> 01:00:24,526
- Hi, honey. Having a good day?
- Hi.

1004
01:00:24,634 --> 01:00:25,896
Yeah.

1005
01:00:26,469 --> 01:00:28,403
I left my purse in the car.

1006
01:00:30,173 --> 01:00:31,902
Take a look at this.

1007
01:00:32,776 --> 01:00:34,744
What is she doing here?

1008
01:00:35,745 --> 01:00:37,804
She came over to see Martha.
She just dropped in.

1009
01:00:37,881 --> 01:00:40,315
You got to make sure
to keep my mother out of the kitchen.

1010
01:00:40,383 --> 01:00:43,682
We got one game to go. We'll blow it.
Get her out of the house!

1011
01:00:43,753 --> 01:00:44,981
Okay.

1012
01:00:52,762 --> 01:00:54,491
What is this, a drag race?

1013
01:01:03,039 --> 01:01:05,872
- No Cokes?
- The Cokes, the Cokes!

1014
01:01:05,942 --> 01:01:08,308
The Cokes, right. The Cokes.

1015
01:01:09,479 --> 01:01:11,037
- I'll be right back, okay?
- Okay.

1016
01:01:11,114 --> 01:01:12,342
All right.

1017
01:01:13,383 --> 01:01:14,714
Chester!

1018
01:01:14,784 --> 01:01:17,275
Chester, the Cokes. Give me the Cokes.

1019
01:01:18,555 --> 01:01:20,318
You read my mind. Thanks.

1020
01:01:43,079 --> 01:01:46,378
Well, that's it. I'm just gonna have to get
a bigger refrigerator.

1021
01:01:46,816 --> 01:01:49,717
Honey, is there another Coke in there?
Take a look, will you?

1022
01:01:55,558 --> 01:01:57,423
Why is this door closed?

1023
01:01:59,596 --> 01:02:01,188
What? What?

1024
01:02:03,666 --> 01:02:06,100
- I love you!
- Chester!

1025
01:02:06,603 --> 01:02:08,935
I'm sorry, we're out of Cokes.

1026
01:02:09,539 --> 01:02:12,702
Why don't we go and get some, okay?

1027
01:02:13,410 --> 01:02:16,106
- This is it. Now!
- Stop it. Matthew's home!

1028
01:02:16,179 --> 01:02:18,511
Matthew's a big boy.
He knows what goes on.

1029
01:02:18,581 --> 01:02:21,175
He's a big boy. Forget about it, will you?

1030
01:02:23,153 --> 01:02:25,519
You're right. He's a small boy.
He don't know nothing!

1031
01:02:25,588 --> 01:02:27,954
Know what I mean? I need a drink now.

1032
01:02:29,292 --> 01:02:30,953
My mom's gonna be coming home soon,

1033
01:02:31,027 --> 01:02:32,051
- so I have things to do.
- Yeah.

1034
01:02:32,128 --> 01:02:35,529
And you know, dishes to wash,
my room to be cleaned.

1035
01:02:35,598 --> 01:02:37,566
So, why don't you come back
some other time?

1036
01:02:37,634 --> 01:02:39,932
- Okay, I'd really like to.
- Okay.

1037
01:02:40,003 --> 01:02:41,368
Do you want to go
to a movie sometime?

1038
01:02:41,438 --> 01:02:42,769
- Sure. That's great.
- Okay.

1039
01:02:42,839 --> 01:02:45,364
- That's perfect. All right, call me.
- Okay.

1040
01:02:45,608 --> 01:02:48,076
- Thanks, Martha. Bye.
- All right, you got it.

1041
01:02:52,682 --> 01:02:54,274
- Matthew?
- Mom!

1042
01:02:54,684 --> 01:02:56,242
- Martha!
- Chester?

1043
01:02:56,519 --> 01:02:57,850
Bess!

1044
01:02:57,987 --> 01:03:01,354
What's going on here?
Matthew, why are you dressed like that?

1045
01:03:05,261 --> 01:03:08,094
What the hell's going on?
I'd like to know.

1046
01:03:09,232 --> 01:03:12,463
Bess, take it easy, will you? It's nothing.

1047
01:03:14,504 --> 01:03:18,201
When I was a kid I did the same thing.
I used to dress up like a girl, too.

1048
01:03:18,808 --> 01:03:21,368
You know how kids are,
they're always doing crazy things.

1049
01:03:21,444 --> 01:03:25,039
You know, girls want to be boys.
Boys want to be girls.

1050
01:03:25,115 --> 01:03:26,446
Some of them are.

1051
01:03:28,118 --> 01:03:30,245
Mom, Chester didn't mean any harm.

1052
01:03:30,320 --> 01:03:32,254
He just wanted me to help him
on the soccer team.

1053
01:03:32,322 --> 01:03:35,382
- So he could get a winning team.
- Matthew, go to your room.

1054
01:03:35,825 --> 01:03:37,759
- But, Mom...
- Go to your room!

1055
01:03:42,832 --> 01:03:45,562
So, that's the new team
that he was playing on.

1056
01:03:45,635 --> 01:03:49,469
You know, it's one thing to lie to me,
but to corrupt my son.

1057
01:03:49,772 --> 01:03:52,104
That day in the car
when you got that call from Martha,

1058
01:03:52,175 --> 01:03:53,472
that was Matthew who called you.

1059
01:03:53,543 --> 01:03:55,636
How could you
keep lying to me like this?

1060
01:03:55,712 --> 01:03:59,648
Bess, I just wanted to have a winning
team so we could get married.

1061
01:03:59,716 --> 01:04:02,981
- I never looked at it that way.
- Yeah, well, I look at it that way.

1062
01:04:04,087 --> 01:04:06,282
You are a great salesman, Chester,

1063
01:04:06,356 --> 01:04:09,621
but I'm finished buying your bullshit!
Now, get out of here!

1064
01:04:09,726 --> 01:04:13,787
Bess, I didn't mean any harm.
I did it for us. I love you!

1065
01:04:13,863 --> 01:04:14,989
Just get out.

1066
01:04:33,283 --> 01:04:37,151
Idiot. Moron! Jerk-off!

1067
01:04:37,587 --> 01:04:40,055
Hey, buddy, what's your problem?

1068
01:04:40,590 --> 01:04:42,751
I don't have to take your bullshit.

1069
01:04:42,859 --> 01:04:45,350
I wasn't talking to you,
I was talking to myself.

1070
01:04:45,428 --> 01:04:47,828
I got a problem, my girl threw me out.

1071
01:04:47,897 --> 01:04:49,524
That's why I'm drinking.

1072
01:04:49,599 --> 01:04:52,432
I'm sorry.
You know, I didn't mean any harm.

1073
01:04:53,636 --> 01:04:57,470
Look, buddy,
I've heard that story a thousand times.

1074
01:04:58,241 --> 01:04:59,936
I know what you're going through.

1075
01:05:00,009 --> 01:05:04,105
Listen, you just have to say to yourself,
"To hell with it."

1076
01:05:04,247 --> 01:05:06,078
Let her keep the furniture.

1077
01:05:08,718 --> 01:05:11,915
- Give me another one.
- Kid, you've had enough.

1078
01:05:11,988 --> 01:05:14,479
You're gonna spoil your dinner.
Why don't you go on home?

1079
01:05:15,024 --> 01:05:16,286
No, I don't want to go home.

1080
01:05:16,359 --> 01:05:17,826
Come on. Come on,
give me another one.

1081
01:05:17,894 --> 01:05:20,488
Kid, the way you're drinking,
you must have a girl problem.

1082
01:05:20,563 --> 01:05:21,894
Yeah.

1083
01:05:21,965 --> 01:05:24,729
- Tell me about it. Maybe I can help.
- How could you help me?

1084
01:05:24,801 --> 01:05:27,065
With girls, I've been through it all.

1085
01:05:27,136 --> 01:05:31,937
I've been stood up, shook up,
hung up, screwed up, and tied up.

1086
01:05:32,208 --> 01:05:34,199
What's your problem?
Did y'all have a fight?

1087
01:05:34,277 --> 01:05:35,869
No, no, no.

1088
01:05:35,945 --> 01:05:38,004
No, we never fight. We get along great.

1089
01:05:38,081 --> 01:05:40,515
We laugh together,
we like the same music,

1090
01:05:40,583 --> 01:05:42,448
the same sports.

1091
01:05:42,819 --> 01:05:44,878
No, we get along just great.

1092
01:05:45,321 --> 01:05:46,549
Then what's the problem?

1093
01:05:48,691 --> 01:05:50,318
She don't know I'm a boy.

1094
01:05:50,393 --> 01:05:53,260
Kid, with this girl,
I don't know what you're doing

1095
01:05:53,329 --> 01:05:55,490
but you must be doing it wrong.

1096
01:05:57,834 --> 01:05:59,199
Look, buddy.

1097
01:05:59,269 --> 01:06:01,794
You ought to get out there
and start dating again.

1098
01:06:01,871 --> 01:06:03,771
You go out there, what do you meet?

1099
01:06:03,840 --> 01:06:07,173
You meet girls looking for husbands
and husbands looking for girls.

1100
01:06:07,243 --> 01:06:09,040
Well, you know what they say,

1101
01:06:09,112 --> 01:06:12,411
there's plenty of fish in the sea
if you got the right bait.

1102
01:06:12,482 --> 01:06:15,576
Yeah. The trouble is,
my hook ain't what it used to be.

1103
01:06:16,386 --> 01:06:17,785
What happened, anyway?

1104
01:06:18,988 --> 01:06:22,788
I don't want to go into it.
It's a long story. I don't...

1105
01:06:22,859 --> 01:06:24,622
Hey, come on.

1106
01:06:25,161 --> 01:06:28,130
Get it off your chest.
It'll make you feel better.

1107
01:06:28,498 --> 01:06:31,262
Remember, there ain't nothing
you can tell me

1108
01:06:31,434 --> 01:06:33,163
that I ain't heard before.

1109
01:06:33,236 --> 01:06:35,500
So, come on, what happened?

1110
01:06:35,672 --> 01:06:38,607
Well, what happened was,

1111
01:06:38,675 --> 01:06:41,838
I took her son,
and I dressed him up like a girl

1112
01:06:42,145 --> 01:06:44,773
and I talked him into playing with me.

1113
01:06:47,116 --> 01:06:48,947
Stay out, you sicko!

1114
01:06:49,018 --> 01:06:51,248
We don't want your kind in there!

1115
01:06:51,454 --> 01:06:54,116
Boy! What a happy hour.

1116
01:06:55,591 --> 01:06:57,855
Well, at least I beat the check.

1117
01:07:01,731 --> 01:07:03,756
Chester, anything new with Bess?

1118
01:07:04,467 --> 01:07:07,402
I've been calling her all week.
She won't talk to me.

1119
01:07:08,304 --> 01:07:09,601
It's over.

1120
01:07:09,672 --> 01:07:12,368
I wish there was something I could do.

1121
01:07:13,643 --> 01:07:17,739
Chester, I just want you to know
that when you're hurting, I'm hurting.

1122
01:07:18,281 --> 01:07:19,543
All right.

1123
01:07:20,917 --> 01:07:22,475
So, how's Matthew?

1124
01:07:22,652 --> 01:07:24,916
I don't know.
I haven't spoken to him, either.

1125
01:07:24,987 --> 01:07:26,978
I guess he hates me, too.

1126
01:07:27,256 --> 01:07:29,884
Now I got to go tell the girls
there's no more Martha.

1127
01:07:30,293 --> 01:07:32,693
No more Martha's only half our trouble.

1128
01:07:32,762 --> 01:07:35,788
Come with me.
I want you to see what we up against.

1129
01:07:36,966 --> 01:07:38,490
Pick him up, pick him up, pick him up!

1130
01:07:38,568 --> 01:07:41,731
Move it, move it, move it, move it!
Come on!

1131
01:07:42,105 --> 01:07:44,403
Only two kinds of people
on the soccer field,

1132
01:07:44,474 --> 01:07:47,307
the quick and the dead!
That's quick. Yes!

1133
01:07:47,377 --> 01:07:49,004
Yes! That's fast.

1134
01:07:49,078 --> 01:07:51,069
They ought to tell that guy
the war's over.

1135
01:07:51,147 --> 01:07:54,412
Let's go, let's go! Let's kill! That's it!
That's it! Kill! All right.

1136
01:07:54,484 --> 01:07:56,418
I'd better go get our troops together.

1137
01:07:56,486 --> 01:07:58,920
I will not have cowards on my team!
Go quick!

1138
01:07:58,988 --> 01:08:00,012
Gather around!

1139
01:08:00,089 --> 01:08:01,716
Make it bleed! Yes!

1140
01:08:01,791 --> 01:08:03,850
Hit the bag! Hit the bag!

1141
01:08:04,627 --> 01:08:06,288
Get the ball back!

1142
01:08:06,863 --> 01:08:08,023
Yeah!

1143
01:08:08,097 --> 01:08:10,429
Come on, let's see some action now!

1144
01:08:15,405 --> 01:08:18,374
You're gonna have to do
without Kimberly today, Chester.

1145
01:08:18,441 --> 01:08:20,875
When I told her I didn't want her to play
in today's game,

1146
01:08:20,943 --> 01:08:23,741
I just wanted her to sit in the stands
and root for the team,

1147
01:08:23,813 --> 01:08:25,940
she got upset and went home.

1148
01:08:26,082 --> 01:08:29,415
How could you do that?
She was trying so hard.

1149
01:08:29,719 --> 01:08:32,711
We want to win, don't we?
She'll get over it.

1150
01:08:33,256 --> 01:08:36,487
Well, we're gonna have to do
without Martha, too. She's a no-show.

1151
01:08:36,826 --> 01:08:39,886
There's no time for jokes, Chester.
Tell me you're kidding.

1152
01:08:39,962 --> 01:08:43,625
I wish I was, but that's it, no Martha.

1153
01:08:46,102 --> 01:08:48,263
I don't care where she is.
You get that girl down here.

1154
01:08:48,337 --> 01:08:49,668
The team needs her.

1155
01:08:49,739 --> 01:08:52,799
And, Chester, you need her, too.

1156
01:09:18,835 --> 01:09:20,928
Company, ho!

1157
01:09:27,043 --> 01:09:28,203
Hello, ladies and gentlemen.

1158
01:09:28,277 --> 01:09:30,802
We hope to have
an exciting afternoon here for you today

1159
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:33,974
at the Rocky Mountain
Soccer League Championship game.

1160
01:09:34,050 --> 01:09:37,508
Playing today is
the Ladybugs versus the Flames.

1161
01:09:37,887 --> 01:09:40,685
- How's it going?
- Hey, Matthew.

1162
01:09:41,424 --> 01:09:43,892
I didn't expect to see you here.
How are you?

1163
01:09:43,960 --> 01:09:46,690
- I'm hanging in there.
- Yeah, me, too.

1164
01:09:47,763 --> 01:09:50,254
How's your mom?
She's not talking to me, you know.

1165
01:09:50,333 --> 01:09:53,393
Yeah, I know. She's not talking
to me too much, either.

1166
01:09:53,870 --> 01:09:55,531
What's in the bag?

1167
01:09:56,372 --> 01:09:57,703
Martha.

1168
01:09:57,773 --> 01:09:59,331
I was thinking about
how hard you worked

1169
01:09:59,408 --> 01:10:03,003
to get to this game and, well, I'm here.

1170
01:10:06,949 --> 01:10:09,611
You're an okay guy yourself, you know?

1171
01:10:09,819 --> 01:10:11,218
But I don't know...

1172
01:10:11,287 --> 01:10:14,154
You got to be mentally tough
as well as physically tough!

1173
01:10:14,223 --> 01:10:17,192
You'll thank me one day.
I'll make men out of you!

1174
01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:19,055
They're a tough team.

1175
01:10:19,328 --> 01:10:21,091
Listen, Matthew, I...

1176
01:10:25,234 --> 01:10:27,964
Hold it, hold it! No, Matthew, no.

1177
01:10:28,905 --> 01:10:30,805
There's no more Martha.

1178
01:10:30,973 --> 01:10:33,100
I mean, I want to win

1179
01:10:34,677 --> 01:10:36,542
but I love your mother
more than winning.

1180
01:10:39,348 --> 01:10:42,476
Chester, I know for a long time
we didn't hit it off.

1181
01:10:43,786 --> 01:10:46,016
And I think it's because
I never really believed

1182
01:10:46,088 --> 01:10:47,851
you really wanted to marry my mother.

1183
01:10:47,924 --> 01:10:51,985
And now I know you were just scared
because you didn't believe in yourself.

1184
01:10:52,662 --> 01:10:55,495
Chester, have confidence in yourself.

1185
01:10:56,365 --> 01:10:58,833
You're a great guy, I know.

1186
01:11:00,169 --> 01:11:02,899
Otherwise my mother wouldn't love you.

1187
01:11:05,141 --> 01:11:06,403
Thanks.

1188
01:11:11,247 --> 01:11:13,943
I didn't see Kimberly out there.
Where is she?

1189
01:11:14,116 --> 01:11:16,346
She's not playing, she's home.

1190
01:11:17,420 --> 01:11:20,719
- How come?
- Her father, he wouldn't let her play.

1191
01:11:20,957 --> 01:11:22,151
"Not playing."

1192
01:11:25,027 --> 01:11:26,392
All right.

1193
01:11:26,462 --> 01:11:28,953
You guys are going
to do something amazing today.

1194
01:11:29,031 --> 01:11:30,999
You're going to play
the best game of your life.

1195
01:11:31,067 --> 01:11:32,364
And you're going to win!

1196
01:11:34,904 --> 01:11:37,634
And you're going to do it without Martha.

1197
01:11:37,707 --> 01:11:39,197
- What did you say?
- What are you talking about?

1198
01:11:39,275 --> 01:11:41,004
- But we need her!
- It's not fair.

1199
01:11:41,077 --> 01:11:42,908
She won't be here today.

1200
01:11:43,946 --> 01:11:46,471
Look, we can win without Martha.

1201
01:11:46,649 --> 01:11:49,675
One person doesn't win a game,
the team wins the game.

1202
01:11:49,785 --> 01:11:54,017
Just remember, win or lose,
if you give it your best, you're winners!

1203
01:11:54,256 --> 01:11:55,917
Now let's get them!

1204
01:12:01,197 --> 01:12:04,166
Remember! Take no prisoners.

1205
01:12:05,101 --> 01:12:09,765
Wound, whip, kill, capture,
and/or destroy the enemy!

1206
01:12:09,839 --> 01:12:11,773
Chester, you all right?

1207
01:12:12,074 --> 01:12:14,099
- I got a headache.
- Is it bad?

1208
01:12:14,176 --> 01:12:17,111
Is it bad? My hair hurts.

1209
01:12:24,720 --> 01:12:26,051
Shit!

1210
01:12:32,395 --> 01:12:33,760
My God!

1211
01:12:33,829 --> 01:12:36,491
Put the ball in the net!

1212
01:12:36,899 --> 01:12:38,230
Holy cow!

1213
01:12:40,136 --> 01:12:41,660
Well, I'll be damned.

1214
01:12:42,038 --> 01:12:45,565
It took you 14 seconds to score!
You call that hustle?

1215
01:12:47,443 --> 01:12:50,241
The only thing quicker than that
is when I'm having sex.

1216
01:12:55,151 --> 01:12:57,051
Defense! Defense!

1217
01:12:59,855 --> 01:13:02,983
I command you to score now!

1218
01:13:04,427 --> 01:13:05,985
Holy boogers!

1219
01:13:07,763 --> 01:13:08,957
Yes!

1220
01:13:10,666 --> 01:13:12,224
It's all right, it's all right.

1221
01:13:12,301 --> 01:13:15,759
- I believe we still got a good chance.
- Good chance.

1222
01:13:15,838 --> 01:13:18,602
Like a one-legged man
in an ass-kicking contest.

1223
01:13:20,409 --> 01:13:21,603
What the hell?

1224
01:13:31,887 --> 01:13:33,479
Stupid idiots!

1225
01:13:34,790 --> 01:13:37,623
- Chester, look!
- Let them fight.

1226
01:13:37,793 --> 01:13:39,658
Let's try to win at something.

1227
01:13:39,729 --> 01:13:41,492
You can't do that. You're out of the...

1228
01:13:41,564 --> 01:13:43,896
- What're you doing to my little girl?
- She's out of the game!

1229
01:13:43,966 --> 01:13:45,297
- Get away from her.
- Oh, my God, Penny!

1230
01:13:45,367 --> 01:13:47,232
- Oh, Penny...
- Go away!

1231
01:13:47,303 --> 01:13:49,203
Show no mercy!

1232
01:13:49,405 --> 01:13:50,838
Chester, come on.

1233
01:13:51,107 --> 01:13:53,575
- Oh, my God!
- Beat them up! Now attack!

1234
01:13:53,642 --> 01:13:55,007
Hey, Coach Bull!

1235
01:13:55,077 --> 01:13:57,910
Take it easy, will you?
This isn't the army, you know!

1236
01:13:57,980 --> 01:13:59,572
It's my army, mister!

1237
01:13:59,648 --> 01:14:03,049
And if you were in my army,
I'd have you on latrine duty!

1238
01:14:03,786 --> 01:14:06,016
It smells like I'm there now.

1239
01:14:06,255 --> 01:14:08,917
Nobody talks to Coach Bull that way!

1240
01:14:09,125 --> 01:14:11,855
Coach Bull! I know your full name.

1241
01:14:11,927 --> 01:14:14,361
That does it!
Prepare to defend yourself!

1242
01:14:14,430 --> 01:14:16,625
- Let me at him, Chester...
- Take it easy! Take it easy.

1243
01:14:16,699 --> 01:14:18,223
No, I can take him, Chester!
I can take him!

1244
01:14:18,300 --> 01:14:21,827
- I'm warning you, I never hit a lady!
- And I'm warning you, she's no lady!

1245
01:14:21,904 --> 01:14:22,928
Break it up! Break it up!

1246
01:14:23,005 --> 01:14:24,734
Back to your benches now! Let's go!

1247
01:14:24,807 --> 01:14:27,207
Do you want to play this game or not?
Back to your benches.

1248
01:14:27,276 --> 01:14:28,573
Come on! Get to your positions!

1249
01:14:30,946 --> 01:14:33,574
- Incoming!
- Hit it!

1250
01:14:37,386 --> 01:14:39,320
I'll be right back, all right?

1251
01:14:47,396 --> 01:14:49,557
Martha, what are you doing here?

1252
01:14:49,965 --> 01:14:51,330
Kimberly.

1253
01:14:51,400 --> 01:14:53,459
I have something
very important to show you.

1254
01:14:53,536 --> 01:14:55,128
Oh, my God!

1255
01:14:55,571 --> 01:14:57,402
The first half is over.

1256
01:14:57,473 --> 01:15:00,670
The Flames leading
the Ladybugs, 3-nothing.

1257
01:15:00,876 --> 01:15:02,503
And now, everybody,

1258
01:15:02,645 --> 01:15:05,205
here is the Rocky Mountain
High School Band

1259
01:15:05,848 --> 01:15:09,477
and the giant weenie
and the weenie lady.

1260
01:15:12,054 --> 01:15:14,215
Aren't you going to say something?

1261
01:15:14,423 --> 01:15:16,584
Yeah, let's go home.
We'll beat the traffic.

1262
01:15:16,659 --> 01:15:17,853
All right, Chester.

1263
01:15:17,927 --> 01:15:20,395
- Kimberly's ready and raring to go.
- All right, I need her.

1264
01:15:20,462 --> 01:15:22,259
Hey, you got the bag. Good.

1265
01:15:22,331 --> 01:15:23,593
I need Martha, too.

1266
01:15:23,666 --> 01:15:25,691
Yeah, now it's our turn.
We're gonna kick some butt.

1267
01:15:25,768 --> 01:15:27,633
- Julie, get the girls.
- Okay, come on, Kimberly.

1268
01:15:27,703 --> 01:15:29,762
All right, here's how
we're going to play it.

1269
01:15:37,847 --> 01:15:40,315
- You're all set.
- Chester, here they come.

1270
01:15:40,883 --> 01:15:43,647
- This ought to be something.
- Martha!

1271
01:15:48,624 --> 01:15:51,616
All right, girls, settle down, settle down!
Take it easy, will you?

1272
01:15:51,694 --> 01:15:52,820
Come on!

1273
01:15:52,895 --> 01:15:53,987
All right.

1274
01:15:54,063 --> 01:15:56,588
I have a lot to say to you
but we haven't got much time.

1275
01:15:56,665 --> 01:15:58,496
I know you're all excited to see Martha.

1276
01:15:58,567 --> 01:16:00,228
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1277
01:16:00,302 --> 01:16:04,602
Well, I'm glad you're sitting down
because, girls, there is no Martha.

1278
01:16:04,673 --> 01:16:05,765
- What?
- What?

1279
01:16:05,841 --> 01:16:08,935
- Martha is Matthew.
- What?

1280
01:16:09,511 --> 01:16:11,638
Oh, my God! She's a boy!

1281
01:16:12,815 --> 01:16:13,975
- A boy!
- Martha...

1282
01:16:14,049 --> 01:16:15,983
Oh, man! Can you believe that?

1283
01:16:16,051 --> 01:16:18,542
That's right. Martha is Matthew.

1284
01:16:18,787 --> 01:16:20,812
And I'm showing you this
for one reason.

1285
01:16:20,890 --> 01:16:22,721
You don't need Martha anymore.

1286
01:16:22,791 --> 01:16:26,659
You don't need a boy to help you win.
You're women! You don't need anyone!

1287
01:16:26,729 --> 01:16:28,856
You're liberated! You got the vote!

1288
01:16:28,931 --> 01:16:32,025
You can burn your bras,
when you get them.

1289
01:16:32,701 --> 01:16:34,862
Now get out there
and put out those Flames!

1290
01:16:37,172 --> 01:16:39,470
- Dave, look.
- It's Kimberly.

1291
01:16:39,541 --> 01:16:40,701
What's she doing here?

1292
01:16:40,776 --> 01:16:42,505
I don't know.
She told me she was staying home.

1293
01:16:42,578 --> 01:16:44,102
- Kick.
- Chester.

1294
01:16:44,780 --> 01:16:45,940
You can pass it.

1295
01:16:46,015 --> 01:16:49,143
You have five seconds
to get Kimberly out of there.

1296
01:16:50,119 --> 01:16:51,552
- Wait.
- Okay, I got it.

1297
01:16:51,620 --> 01:16:53,144
Easy, okay, okay, now.

1298
01:16:53,222 --> 01:16:54,587
Wait, the ball...

1299
01:16:55,224 --> 01:16:58,682
There's nothing to think about.
Get her out of there.

1300
01:17:00,596 --> 01:17:02,564
Look, we're not in your office now.

1301
01:17:02,631 --> 01:17:04,531
Out here, I call the shots.

1302
01:17:04,733 --> 01:17:07,293
Looks like I misjudged you, Chester.

1303
01:17:07,403 --> 01:17:10,372
I guess you don't care
about your future with this company.

1304
01:17:10,439 --> 01:17:12,464
Right now, all I care about is this team.

1305
01:17:12,541 --> 01:17:15,738
Chester, you've forgotten
what's important to you.

1306
01:17:15,811 --> 01:17:17,938
I didn't forget. You forgot.

1307
01:17:18,414 --> 01:17:19,608
What's more important?

1308
01:17:19,682 --> 01:17:21,912
That strangers look up to you
or your own kid?

1309
01:17:22,618 --> 01:17:24,483
Kimberly's playing today!

1310
01:17:24,987 --> 01:17:27,080
And if it means my job, too bad.

1311
01:17:28,290 --> 01:17:29,917
Look, Chester,

1312
01:17:30,359 --> 01:17:33,851
I just want to win today.
I only want the best out there.

1313
01:17:34,296 --> 01:17:35,888
The best, the best.

1314
01:17:35,965 --> 01:17:38,593
That's all I keep hearing.
You want to be the best.

1315
01:17:38,667 --> 01:17:40,362
Let me ask you this,

1316
01:17:40,602 --> 01:17:44,504
what good is being the best
if it brings out the worst in you?

1317
01:17:50,412 --> 01:17:51,811
Okay, girls, let's go.

1318
01:17:51,880 --> 01:17:55,043
Pester, take right wing.
Kimberly, take left midfield.

1319
01:17:55,117 --> 01:17:57,244
Okay, girls! Let's go! Let's go!
Come on, look alive!

1320
01:17:57,319 --> 01:17:59,617
Go, go, go, go! Come on, now.
Energy! Energy.

1321
01:17:59,688 --> 01:18:02,816
Coach Chester, I'm ready.
Put me back at goal.

1322
01:18:03,592 --> 01:18:06,959
What makes you think
I'd take a chance with you again?

1323
01:18:07,262 --> 01:18:09,560
Go on, hurry up and change.

1324
01:18:10,332 --> 01:18:12,061
Now, look, Larimer.

1325
01:18:12,534 --> 01:18:15,002
You're up against
a tough, tough bunch of girls.

1326
01:18:15,070 --> 01:18:16,970
You got to psych them out.

1327
01:18:17,039 --> 01:18:19,530
Got to make them lose their cool.

1328
01:18:19,708 --> 01:18:22,268
What do you mean, psych them out?

1329
01:18:22,711 --> 01:18:25,407
Well, I'll tell you what I mean.
Let me give you a few tips.

1330
01:18:29,818 --> 01:18:31,080
What are you laughing at?

1331
01:18:31,153 --> 01:18:34,020
If you could see what I'm looking at
you'd be laughing, too.

1332
01:18:34,089 --> 01:18:35,488
What does the score say?

1333
01:18:35,557 --> 01:18:37,855
It won't be like that for long.

1334
01:18:38,060 --> 01:18:40,585
All right girls, cut the crap, let's play.

1335
01:18:40,662 --> 01:18:45,565
Roses are red, violets are blue.
I'm glad I'm me, not ugly like all of you!

1336
01:18:45,768 --> 01:18:47,998
That's it, Lar! That's my girl!

1337
01:18:48,404 --> 01:18:50,099
Out of my way, sucker!

1338
01:18:51,974 --> 01:18:53,271
Go! Go!

1339
01:18:53,976 --> 01:18:57,002
- Stop the ball!
- Go home! Your mama wants you!

1340
01:19:09,925 --> 01:19:12,792
The Ladybugs have scored
their first goal, folks!

1341
01:19:12,895 --> 01:19:15,329
It's now the Flames leading 3-1.

1342
01:19:18,901 --> 01:19:21,529
- All right! They did it!
- Our first score!

1343
01:19:22,071 --> 01:19:23,265
What a feeling!

1344
01:19:23,338 --> 01:19:25,602
I had the same feeling when I was 16.

1345
01:19:41,156 --> 01:19:42,748
They broke my nail!

1346
01:19:42,825 --> 01:19:45,623
Mom, those bitches broke my nail!

1347
01:19:45,794 --> 01:19:47,318
They broke your nail?

1348
01:19:47,963 --> 01:19:51,057
- They broke her nail!
- David, they broke her nail.

1349
01:19:51,166 --> 01:19:53,157
They broke her nail.

1350
01:19:53,235 --> 01:19:55,135
- Did you break her nail?
- Way to go!

1351
01:19:55,204 --> 01:19:56,569
Way to go!

1352
01:19:57,005 --> 01:20:00,406
- Get those nail breakers!
- Get those nail breakers!

1353
01:20:00,476 --> 01:20:04,310
Get those nail breakers!
Get those nail breakers!

1354
01:20:04,379 --> 01:20:07,473
Get those nail breakers!
Get those nail breakers!

1355
01:20:11,954 --> 01:20:14,184
Come on! Welfelt! Welfelt!

1356
01:20:14,256 --> 01:20:15,518
We're doing it!

1357
01:20:21,663 --> 01:20:24,291
The Ladybugs
have scored their second goal!

1358
01:20:24,399 --> 01:20:28,165
The score is now
the Flames 3, the Ladybugs 2.

1359
01:20:28,504 --> 01:20:30,233
Let's break another nail.

1360
01:20:34,610 --> 01:20:37,875
It's coming to you, Penny!
Penny, look around, it's coming to you!

1361
01:20:37,946 --> 01:20:40,176
Out of bounds. Ladybugs' ball.

1362
01:20:41,049 --> 01:20:42,607
This one's for you, Coach Chester.

1363
01:20:56,298 --> 01:20:57,822
Pester, come on!

1364
01:21:12,581 --> 01:21:13,843
What are you doing?

1365
01:21:13,916 --> 01:21:16,282
Come on! Keep it going, Pester!
Come on!

1366
01:21:25,327 --> 01:21:27,158
Yes, Pester!

1367
01:21:28,897 --> 01:21:32,731
- All right!
- Beautiful! I told you, you're beautiful!

1368
01:21:33,435 --> 01:21:35,130
The score is now tied!

1369
01:21:35,204 --> 01:21:38,139
Get down and give me 30!
Get down and give me 30!

1370
01:21:38,207 --> 01:21:40,334
Everybody get down and give me 30!

1371
01:21:40,409 --> 01:21:42,604
Flames 3, Ladybugs 3.

1372
01:21:45,314 --> 01:21:47,475
Chu! Come on, Chu!

1373
01:21:47,549 --> 01:21:49,540
Get ready! It's coming your way!

1374
01:21:51,420 --> 01:21:53,718
Now pump it in there!

1375
01:21:56,191 --> 01:21:57,749
- Good hands!
- Good save!

1376
01:21:57,826 --> 01:21:59,623
- Good girl!
- Goody, goody!

1377
01:22:00,696 --> 01:22:03,062
Put it in there! Put it in there!

1378
01:22:05,534 --> 01:22:08,002
I want that goalie tested for steroids!

1379
01:22:08,337 --> 01:22:10,635
She's a magician.
She became the Great Wall.

1380
01:22:16,178 --> 01:22:17,440
Oh, no!

1381
01:22:17,646 --> 01:22:19,739
- Is she okay?
- That's tripping on blue.

1382
01:22:19,815 --> 01:22:21,840
Penalty kick for the Ladybugs.

1383
01:22:24,086 --> 01:22:26,179
- I think she's all right.
- She's okay.

1384
01:22:26,255 --> 01:22:27,813
All right, who's going
to take the kick, bugs?

1385
01:22:27,889 --> 01:22:29,151
You take it.

1386
01:22:29,224 --> 01:22:31,351
All right, who's going to take the kick?

1387
01:22:31,426 --> 01:22:33,519
No, no. I don't want to.

1388
01:22:33,595 --> 01:22:35,563
Kim, you take it!

1389
01:22:35,731 --> 01:22:39,030
- Come on, are you all right, seven?
- Yeah, okay. Yeah.

1390
01:22:39,401 --> 01:22:41,232
Come on, you can do it.

1391
01:22:41,903 --> 01:22:43,734
The Ladybugs are going to take
this penalty kick

1392
01:22:43,805 --> 01:22:46,296
with just about six seconds left to go.

1393
01:22:46,408 --> 01:22:47,875
I can't look.

1394
01:23:21,443 --> 01:23:22,842
She did it!

1395
01:23:22,911 --> 01:23:25,175
Yes, we won! We won!

1396
01:23:25,480 --> 01:23:27,277
That's my daughter!

1397
01:23:41,863 --> 01:23:43,990
Julie, you know what I just heard?

1398
01:23:44,166 --> 01:23:47,033
Chester put a boy
on a girl's soccer team.

1399
01:23:47,502 --> 01:23:48,901
That's imagination.

1400
01:23:48,970 --> 01:23:51,564
That's the kind of man I want in charge
of my sales department.

1401
01:23:51,640 --> 01:23:54,370
I'm talking a whole new income bracket
for Chester.

1402
01:23:54,443 --> 01:23:57,207
Well, we're a team, you know?
I helped pick out the wig.

1403
01:24:10,792 --> 01:24:12,157
So, you did it.

1404
01:24:13,195 --> 01:24:15,220
You didn't need Martha to win.

1405
01:24:15,931 --> 01:24:18,024
I'm going to miss her, though.

1406
01:24:18,600 --> 01:24:21,592
We were supposed
to go to the movies together.

1407
01:24:22,871 --> 01:24:24,668
Well, you could go with me.

1408
01:24:26,942 --> 01:24:28,307
I'd like that.

1409
01:24:42,190 --> 01:24:44,920
Well, Mr. Vice President,
I'm very proud of you.

1410
01:24:44,993 --> 01:24:47,018
This new year-round
sports program of yours

1411
01:24:47,095 --> 01:24:50,292
has been very good
for Mullen Industries' profile.

1412
01:24:50,565 --> 01:24:52,897
By the way, how's married life?

1413
01:24:52,968 --> 01:24:55,528
We're getting along real good,
real good.

1414
01:24:55,604 --> 01:24:58,573
In fact, pretty soon, I'll be hearing
the pitter-patter of little feet.

1415
01:24:58,640 --> 01:24:59,664
- Really?
- Yeah.

1416
01:24:59,741 --> 01:25:02,005
Her mother's moving in with us,
you know.

1417
01:25:02,077 --> 01:25:05,535
I understand your boy Matthew's been
seeing a lot of my daughter Kimberly.

1418
01:25:05,614 --> 01:25:07,081
Yes, Dave.

1419
01:25:07,682 --> 01:25:09,411
More than you know.

1420
01:25:12,387 --> 01:25:16,255
All right, boys. This is the big one.
The championship game.

1421
01:25:16,324 --> 01:25:18,554
And you're gonna go out there
and play the game of your life

1422
01:25:18,627 --> 01:25:19,992
because you're men.

1423
01:25:20,061 --> 01:25:22,757
- Are you with me?
- Yeah!

1424
01:25:22,831 --> 01:25:24,890
We're number one! We're number one!

1425
01:25:24,966 --> 01:25:27,366
And don't forget, boys, give it to them!

1426
01:25:27,669 --> 01:25:30,536
- Say, are you Coach Chester Lee?
- That's right.

1427
01:25:30,806 --> 01:25:32,273
I'm Coach Cannoli.

1428
01:25:32,340 --> 01:25:36,106
There's a rumor that you,
on your soccer team,

1429
01:25:36,178 --> 01:25:37,770
dressed a boy as a girl!

1430
01:25:37,846 --> 01:25:41,475
Cannoli, that's patently ridiculous.
I'm sorry, Chester.

1431
01:25:41,550 --> 01:25:43,017
I'm insulted.

1432
01:25:43,084 --> 01:25:46,918
How can you stoop so low as to repeat
a ridiculous rumor like that?

1433
01:25:47,622 --> 01:25:49,283
How dare you?

1434
01:25:49,491 --> 01:25:51,118
Come on, girls. Let's go!

1435
01:25:51,193 --> 01:25:52,251
Yeah!

1436
01:25:54,329 --> 01:25:55,523
Coach!

1437
01:25:55,597 --> 01:25:58,327
Come on, let's go get them, girls!
Let's go and get them!

1438
01:25:58,400 --> 01:26:01,631
Girls! Make sure you got your cups on!

1439
01:26:02,504 --> 01:26:05,803
Chester, you got the job you want,
you got the girl you want.

1440
01:26:05,874 --> 01:26:07,774
You're on top of the world.

1441
01:26:08,210 --> 01:26:11,179
Yeah, I finally got some respect.

1442
01:29:30,879 --> 01:29:32,676
I finally got some respect.
