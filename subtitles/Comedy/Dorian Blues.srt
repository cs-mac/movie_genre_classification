1
00:01:26,619 --> 00:01:28,746
He died ten years ago,
and I still find...

2
00:01:28,822 --> 00:01:31,256
...its good to talk about it sometimes

3
00:01:31,324 --> 00:01:33,258
I find it's good to
talk about everything.

4
00:01:33,326 --> 00:01:35,089
My therapist says
I overdo that.

5
00:01:35,161 --> 00:01:36,651
That I overanalyze.

6
00:01:36,729 --> 00:01:39,630
Of course, she's bulimic so
let's not get too preachy.

7
00:01:39,699 --> 00:01:43,499
But the first thing you
should know about me: I'm gay.

8
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:47,199
I'm gay, and what's more,
a stereotypical gay.

9
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:50,003
Always loved fashion,
hated sports...

10
00:01:50,076 --> 00:01:52,044
...and though it doesn't
always work to cliché...

11
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:54,137
...it did in my family
where there was me...

12
00:01:54,214 --> 00:01:57,342
...and there was my
kid brother, Nicky.

13
00:01:57,417 --> 00:02:00,716
He wouldn't look at another
guy except to ask for a beer...

14
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:03,984
...was our school's star
quarterback, great student.

15
00:02:04,057 --> 00:02:06,753
When they say high school are
the best years of your life...

16
00:02:06,826 --> 00:02:09,420
...there talking about
his life, not mine.

17
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,894
Look at that smile like he
grew up in a blue jeans ad.

18
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:15,992
Hey whoa, hold on a sec
Nick, let 'em take you in.

19
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:17,331
Thanks.

20
00:02:17,403 --> 00:02:19,871
Really had to
twist his arm, huh?

21
00:02:19,939 --> 00:02:23,067
See, confidence for my
brother was never an issue.

22
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:26,010
I don't care if its
with women, guys...

23
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:28,309
Oh, great, company.

24
00:02:28,381 --> 00:02:30,144
Yeah, don't ask me her name.

25
00:02:30,216 --> 00:02:31,444
Yeah, Hi.
How are ya?

26
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:32,951
Good to see ya.

27
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:34,281
No, it's OK Nick.

28
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:35,548
Go on, play.

29
00:02:36,856 --> 00:02:39,723
I envied him, 'cause
he was so normal.

30
00:02:39,792 --> 00:02:41,851
Dad loved normal.

31
00:02:41,928 --> 00:02:44,123
There's Dad now,
fixin' the old set

32
00:02:44,197 --> 00:02:46,165
Dad was usually
in a foul mood.

33
00:02:46,232 --> 00:02:48,666
This, actually is one of
his more spiritual moments.

34
00:02:48,735 --> 00:02:51,898
And there's mom,
rolling those pennies.

35
00:02:51,971 --> 00:02:54,064
This is about 14
years back now.

36
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:57,007
The funeral I showed you
is still a few years off

37
00:02:57,076 --> 00:02:58,407
This is where we start.

38
00:02:58,478 --> 00:03:00,412
Bush, the father, was
in the White House

39
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,971
I was a senior in high
school, my brother, Nicky...

40
00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:06,382
...a Junior, and Dad was
in his raging prime.

41
00:03:06,452 --> 00:03:08,613
Of course it
wasn't all yelling.

42
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:11,486
There was the dinner hour,
when we discussed politics...

43
00:03:11,558 --> 00:03:15,255
...or, more accurately,
Dad discussed, we agreed.

44
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:17,193
There was an unwritten
rule in our house:

45
00:03:17,263 --> 00:03:19,561
You did not disagree
with my father directly...

46
00:03:19,632 --> 00:03:21,600
...especially about politics.

47
00:03:21,668 --> 00:03:23,863
So, to exert your
individuality you simply...

48
00:03:23,937 --> 00:03:27,429
...agreed with him in the most
original way you could find.

49
00:03:28,908 --> 00:03:32,400
Well, that was our mistake in
giving up Vietnam was that we...

50
00:03:32,478 --> 00:03:35,743
...gave the communists the
idea that we didn't have...

51
00:03:35,815 --> 00:03:37,476
...the resolve for a long fight.

52
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:42,112
Uh, and that our free press
was always going to undermine us.

53
00:03:42,188 --> 00:03:44,213
Well put.

54
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:46,315
Well put.

55
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:49,555
You know Nicky, you make more
sense than men twice your age.

56
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:51,426
I mean doesn't he,
doesn't he?

57
00:03:51,497 --> 00:03:53,829
Good job, son.

58
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:57,063
But as this particular dinner
continued, and Dad went on...

59
00:03:57,136 --> 00:04:00,105
...certain of everything,
something very nerve-wracking...

60
00:04:00,173 --> 00:04:02,141
...began to happen to me.

61
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:06,440
For the first time in my life,
I began to get the urge to disagree.

62
00:04:06,512 --> 00:04:11,381
The more I fought the urge,
the more it grew, and grew, until...

63
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:13,376
I disagree.

64
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,714
I'm sorry.
What was that?

65
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:23,023
I said, I disagree?
I think you're wrong.

66
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:25,621
- Oh, I forgot the applesauce...
- No, no, no sit.

67
00:04:25,698 --> 00:04:27,188
- It's right in the refrigerator.
- No, sit.

68
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:30,065
Everyone in our house has a
right to their own opinion.

69
00:04:30,136 --> 00:04:31,501
So what's yours, Dorian?

70
00:04:31,571 --> 00:04:34,233
You tell us exactly
what I'm wrong about.

71
00:04:34,307 --> 00:04:35,467
Nixon.

72
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:37,099
I don't think he was
a good president...

73
00:04:37,176 --> 00:04:39,110
I think he was a bad
president and a bad man.

74
00:04:39,178 --> 00:04:40,076
I think what Dorian
means here is...

75
00:04:40,146 --> 00:04:41,408
I meant what I said, Nick.

76
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:42,573
Why?

77
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:45,243
Why was Nixon a
bad president?

78
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:46,512
Well he wasn't honest.

79
00:04:46,586 --> 00:04:49,054
Oh.
Well, was Kennedy honest?

80
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:49,781
Kennedy?

81
00:04:49,856 --> 00:04:51,255
Yeah, uh, was
John F. Kennedy honest...

82
00:04:51,324 --> 00:04:53,690
...with the way he won
the election in 1960.

83
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,751
You know, with Cook
County Illinois and...

84
00:04:55,828 --> 00:04:57,261
...the West Virginia Primaries?

85
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:59,093
Well, I'm sure he
wasn't always honest...

86
00:04:59,165 --> 00:05:00,894
I don't think any
politician is.

87
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:03,458
Well then I'm legitimately
confused because if they were...

88
00:05:03,536 --> 00:05:05,367
...both dishonest why
do you hate N ixon...

89
00:05:05,438 --> 00:05:07,497
...and have a picture
of JFK on your wall?

90
00:05:07,573 --> 00:05:08,835
A lot of reasons.

91
00:05:08,908 --> 00:05:10,569
You thought JFK was great.
- Right.

92
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:13,578
Well then, your criterion for
greatness can't be honesty...

93
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:15,773
...otherwise by your own
admission you'd be a hypocrite.

94
00:05:15,848 --> 00:05:17,008
I'm not a hypocrite.

95
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:18,573
No, no.
I,I know.

96
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:20,448
That's what I'm struggling with,
because without you being...

97
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,715
...a hypocrite your
argument makes no sense.

98
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:25,223
Kennedy wasn't a
paranoid schizophrenic.

99
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:28,727
Oh, N ixon is a paranoid
schizophrenic.

100
00:05:28,795 --> 00:05:29,727
I think so.

101
00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:31,730
- So this is an expert opinion.
- Expert?

102
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:33,231
Well, yeah.

103
00:05:33,299 --> 00:05:36,234
I mean that's a rather
sophisticated psychological term;

104
00:05:36,302 --> 00:05:38,395
...paranoid schizophrenic.

105
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:42,407
So I was wondering if, if you
have any experience in the field.

106
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:46,070
A psychiatric degree that
qualifies you to make...

107
00:05:46,145 --> 00:05:49,706
...such a conclusive diagnosis
on a man you've never met.

108
00:05:49,782 --> 00:05:50,714
No.

109
00:05:50,783 --> 00:05:52,910
Maybe you think because you
have a few emotional problems...

110
00:05:52,985 --> 00:05:57,547
...of your own it makes you sort
of an honorary doctor of the stuff.

111
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:03,491
Discussion over.
Potatoes please.

112
00:06:08,768 --> 00:06:12,329
You know, I will give you one
piece of advice via another...

113
00:06:12,405 --> 00:06:15,238
...great American president;
Abraham Lincoln...

114
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:19,301
...who said: "I would rather sit
quietly and have them think...

115
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:23,042
I have nothing intelligent to
say rather than open my mouth...

116
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:24,879
...and remove all doubt.

117
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,347
I got shot down,
but it was worth it...

118
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:31,549
'cause it jarred something.

119
00:06:31,624 --> 00:06:33,751
Later that night,
I had an epiphany:

120
00:06:33,826 --> 00:06:37,318
For the first time in my life,
I realized I was gay.

121
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:41,128
Not just confused, or going
through a phase but actually gay.

122
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,794
That night I came out
of the closet to myself.

123
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:46,968
But this only
made things worse.

124
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,439
I was anxiety-ridden
out of my mind.

125
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:51,568
I needed to talk to someone.

126
00:06:51,644 --> 00:06:54,272
But there was no one in
my family I could go to.

127
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:56,577
I didn't have any
friends in high school.

128
00:06:56,649 --> 00:06:57,343
High school.

129
00:06:58,851 --> 00:07:01,217
Finally in my desperation
I ended up downtown...

130
00:07:01,287 --> 00:07:04,552
...at social services where I met
with a part-time social worker...

131
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:06,922
..with a few issues of his own.

132
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,127
You mind if I drink?

133
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:08,956
Uh, no.

134
00:07:09,028 --> 00:07:11,519
We're not, you know,
really supposed to drink.

135
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:13,155
Look if you're having
a bad day, I...

136
00:07:13,232 --> 00:07:15,962
I am having a bad day,
because this morning...

137
00:07:16,035 --> 00:07:20,062
...my girlfriend and
I of two years... Split.

138
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:21,436
Oh, I'm sorry.

139
00:07:21,507 --> 00:07:22,599
You wanna know the truth?

140
00:07:22,675 --> 00:07:24,472
I think after the
initial shock wears off...

141
00:07:24,544 --> 00:07:27,638
I'm really gonna see this
as a blessing, really.

142
00:07:27,713 --> 00:07:31,649
Because this woman was
on my case from day one.

143
00:07:31,717 --> 00:07:34,811
I mean making demands
and nagging me and...

144
00:07:34,887 --> 00:07:37,185
...you know what she wanted
me to do last week?

145
00:07:37,256 --> 00:07:40,123
She wanted me to enroll
in one of these... Uh...

146
00:07:40,193 --> 00:07:45,631
...what do you call it...
anger management courses.

147
00:07:45,698 --> 00:07:46,722
How'd you feel about that?

148
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:48,733
Pissed me off.

149
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:54,000
Because it's not about anger,
it's about changing me.

150
00:07:54,073 --> 00:07:56,439
You know, about
changing my clothes...

151
00:07:56,509 --> 00:08:02,505
...and my friends and my... You
know, I have a motto, alright?

152
00:08:02,582 --> 00:08:05,415
If you're not happy with me,
exactly the way I am...

153
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,112
...then you can leave.

154
00:08:07,186 --> 00:08:08,847
- So she left.
- Yeah she left.

155
00:08:08,921 --> 00:08:12,254
Anyway, what can we at the
Family Mental Health Clinic...

156
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:13,383
...do for you today?

157
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:15,859
I heard you can provide
low-rate therapists?

158
00:08:15,928 --> 00:08:20,627
Maybe someone who specializes
in sexual orientation issues.

159
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:21,598
Sexual...

160
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:24,363
Someone who thinks
he might be gay.

161
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:25,734
Oooh.

162
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:31,368
Hmm... Here you go,
a Doctor Mitchener.

163
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:36,006
Therapy for... what you got.

164
00:08:36,082 --> 00:08:38,016
- Is this the lowered rate?
- Yeah.

165
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:39,483
I guess I can't
afford therapy.

166
00:08:39,552 --> 00:08:41,713
Totally overrated
anyway, believe me.

167
00:08:42,989 --> 00:08:44,616
Look pal, whatever's
bugging you...

168
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,817
...just hash it out with
someone in your own life.

169
00:08:46,893 --> 00:08:47,985
That usually works.

170
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,288
- Really?
- Yeah.

171
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:51,353
Well I suppose I could
try talking to my mother.

172
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:54,058
If you're mother's a good thing
in your life then that's great.

173
00:08:54,133 --> 00:08:58,365
Mine wasn't in mine.
But then she died.

174
00:08:58,437 --> 00:09:00,428
Things are looking up.

175
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:04,833
- Mom?
- Yes, sweetie?

176
00:09:04,911 --> 00:09:06,071
I need to talk.

177
00:09:08,014 --> 00:09:10,346
Then you sit right
there and talk.

178
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:11,576
Thank you.

179
00:09:18,624 --> 00:09:21,092
- What are you doing?
- Seeing what we're out of.

180
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,957
I can do this and
listen to you.

181
00:09:25,031 --> 00:09:26,089
Talk to me.

182
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:29,532
Mom.

183
00:09:32,138 --> 00:09:33,002
Mom.

184
00:09:39,545 --> 00:09:41,012
Mom, I'm afraid I'm different.

185
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,411
God made us all
different honey...

186
00:09:42,481 --> 00:09:44,005
...to keep life interesting.

187
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,881
You, he made moody.
- That's not all he made me.

188
00:09:46,953 --> 00:09:48,580
Look Mom, I've gotta face it.

189
00:09:48,654 --> 00:09:50,588
I'm not like the
other guys at school.

190
00:09:50,656 --> 00:09:52,248
You never wanted
to be like them.

191
00:09:52,325 --> 00:09:53,815
You called them Neanderthals.

192
00:09:53,893 --> 00:09:57,260
True, I didn't want to be like
them but maybe I wished...

193
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:59,560
...too hard because now
I'm not like anyone.

194
00:09:59,632 --> 00:10:02,123
I find myself envying
the Neanderthals.

195
00:10:02,201 --> 00:10:03,930
Well, you know how
I feel about envy.

196
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:05,334
Envy's not the point.

197
00:10:05,404 --> 00:10:07,201
Ok, just one second now
let me as you something.

198
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:09,741
- OK.
- Let me just ask this.

199
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:10,776
All right.

200
00:10:10,843 --> 00:10:13,710
Last week I bought chocolate
chip cookies and nobody ate them.

201
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:15,269
Should I not get chocolate
chip ever again...

202
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:16,713
...and just stick with oatmeal?

203
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:18,374
Is that what you're
all trying to tell me?

204
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:21,420
The only difference between
my mother and the Berlin Wall?

205
00:10:21,487 --> 00:10:24,320
Some people got
past that wall.

206
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:27,723
Well, that night I decided someone
was going to hear me say it.

207
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:32,162
So before Nick left for this big
party I made him the lucky someone.

208
00:10:39,238 --> 00:10:40,899
Don't freak out.

209
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:44,033
Please, don't freak out.

210
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:48,837
Thank you for
not freaking out.

211
00:10:48,914 --> 00:10:50,074
How many people have
you told this to?

212
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:51,844
- Nobody.
- Don't. Ever.

213
00:10:51,917 --> 00:10:52,576
Do you understand me?

214
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,381
Don't ever talk like
this around anybody.

215
00:10:55,087 --> 00:10:56,884
Jesus Christ man, if Dad
ever heard this shit...

216
00:10:56,956 --> 00:10:58,048
...he'd bury you in the basement.

217
00:10:58,124 --> 00:10:59,989
I'm not telling Dad.

218
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:02,919
But I think some people
suspect already.

219
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:03,586
Who?

220
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:04,857
Well, some guys
at school maybe.

221
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:05,794
Who at school?

222
00:11:05,865 --> 00:11:07,924
Who cares, N icky?
This is who I am.

223
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,935
- I cannot hide it forever.
- This is not who you are.

224
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:12,595
You do not have a
clue who you are.

225
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:13,934
You've always been
the most confused...

226
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:14,973
...screwed up individual...

227
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:17,305
I've been confused
about this.

228
00:11:22,314 --> 00:11:23,474
Oh man, don't cry.

229
00:11:26,252 --> 00:11:28,413
Stop crying, Dorian.
- I'm not.

230
00:11:31,257 --> 00:11:31,746
Dude.

231
00:11:37,596 --> 00:11:38,528
OK.

232
00:11:40,132 --> 00:11:40,996
OK.

233
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:44,559
Look, I promised Kev Halen
that I'd get there early...

234
00:11:44,637 --> 00:11:47,401
...and help him set up so, um,
why don't you come...

235
00:11:47,473 --> 00:11:48,940
...have a few beers we'll clear...

236
00:11:49,008 --> 00:11:51,340
No, that's OK.
You go.

237
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:53,241
I'm fine, really.
Go.

238
00:11:53,312 --> 00:11:55,439
Dorian this a lot for me to
digest right now, all right?

239
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:58,941
Look, I know you like
to talk about stuff.

240
00:11:59,018 --> 00:12:01,748
This is a big one, so
as soon as I get back...

241
00:12:01,821 --> 00:12:04,619
...we'll stay up as late as you want,
talk as late as you want, all right?

242
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:05,520
Thanks.

243
00:12:20,539 --> 00:12:21,471
You need to talk now,
don't you?

244
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:22,837
- Mmm-hmm.
- OK.

245
00:12:24,643 --> 00:12:25,769
So we talked.

246
00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:27,972
And when the phone started
ringing and the whole school...

247
00:12:28,047 --> 00:12:29,674
<i>...wanted my brother
at the party...</i>

248
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,683
...he told Mom to tell
them he was sick.

249
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,241
We had our own party.

250
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:36,254
Got drunk, played poker for
Aunt Bette's Easter money...

251
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:39,155
...told jokes about Mom
and Dad till it hurt.

252
00:12:39,225 --> 00:12:41,125
Turned out to be
a great night.

253
00:12:41,193 --> 00:12:42,558
Truly classic.

254
00:12:42,628 --> 00:12:44,323
The kind of night
that makes you think...

255
00:12:44,396 --> 00:12:47,229
...maybe high school really are
the best years of your life.

256
00:12:59,678 --> 00:13:01,009
- Can I help you?
- Yeah.

257
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:05,414
We were just wondering if you could
give us the definition of a word.

258
00:13:05,484 --> 00:13:07,315
Dictionaries out of print?

259
00:13:07,386 --> 00:13:09,377
Well, you know we thought
it would be easier...

260
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:12,515
...to ask a smart person.

261
00:13:12,591 --> 00:13:14,456
What word?

262
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:16,188
U h, what was that again guys?

263
00:13:17,429 --> 00:13:18,862
Oh yeah, yeah.

264
00:13:18,931 --> 00:13:25,769
It was, um homo... Homosexual.

265
00:13:25,838 --> 00:13:29,774
Could you tell us how you
would define the word; homosexual?

266
00:13:29,842 --> 00:13:33,243
And then maybe use
it in a sentence.

267
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:36,645
I would define it as someone
you're deathly afraid of.

268
00:13:36,715 --> 00:13:40,515
So... Should we be
afraid of you?

269
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:46,454
Come on, that is so rude when
somebody is talking right to you.

270
00:13:46,525 --> 00:13:47,423
We're not talking.

271
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:51,857
Listen, faggot.

272
00:13:51,931 --> 00:13:54,024
I don't know who you think
you're dealing with.

273
00:13:54,099 --> 00:13:55,327
Look out, Cal.

274
00:13:55,401 --> 00:13:56,493
Hey.

275
00:13:56,569 --> 00:13:57,467
Aw.

276
00:13:57,536 --> 00:13:58,525
<i>Shit, man.</i>

277
00:13:59,805 --> 00:14:02,171
Hey, N ick, I was just
messing with him.

278
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:03,640
Yeah?
That's all you ever do, Cal.

279
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:05,939
You know, there's a lot more
to life than messing with people.

280
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:07,376
You ought to branch
out a little bit.

281
00:14:15,721 --> 00:14:17,348
See what I mean?
People suspect.

282
00:14:17,423 --> 00:14:19,789
Just keep denying it.
Remember what H itler said.

283
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:22,123
You tell a lie long
enough and loud enough...

284
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:23,354
...eventually they'll
believe it.

285
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:25,829
So your advice is
be more like H itler?

286
00:14:25,898 --> 00:14:26,956
You know what I mean.

287
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:28,090
Yes.
Stay in the closet.

288
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:29,361
Yeah, and lock the door.

289
00:14:42,748 --> 00:14:43,612
What you writing?

290
00:14:43,682 --> 00:14:45,741
Just, uh, my own journal.

291
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:48,577
All your private thoughts?

292
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:55,185
- Like what?
- Like, private.

293
00:14:55,261 --> 00:14:56,751
So what?
Tell me one.

294
00:14:56,829 --> 00:14:58,228
No, uh thanks.

295
00:14:58,297 --> 00:15:00,788
- Wanna hear one of mine?
- No.

296
00:15:00,866 --> 00:15:04,632
I mean, uh, I'm sure yours
are great but it's just...

297
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:06,694
...mine are more than
enough right now.

298
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,637
Bunch of Neanderthals.

299
00:15:44,576 --> 00:15:46,806
Take the last train
to Clarksville

300
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:49,347
and I'll meet you
at the station. 

301
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:51,440
You can be there
by four thirty,

302
00:15:51,517 --> 00:15:53,951
'cause I made
your reservation. 

303
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:55,919
Don't be slow.

304
00:15:56,355 --> 00:15:58,118
 Oh, no, no, no.

305
00:15:58,657 --> 00:16:00,625
Oh, no, no, no!

306
00:16:02,061 --> 00:16:03,187
Dee, dee, dee, dee, dee, dee.

307
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:04,418
Dee, dee, dee, dee, dee, dee. 

308
00:16:04,663 --> 00:16:06,096
Dee, dee, dee, dee, dee, dee,
dee, dee, dee. 

309
00:16:06,565 --> 00:16:08,960
Take the last train
to Clarksville,

310
00:16:09,034 --> 00:16:11,298
and I must hang up the phone. 

311
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:15,864
I can't hear you in this
noisy rail road station all alone. 

312
00:16:15,941 --> 00:16:17,499
I'm feeling low. 

313
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:20,045
<i>## Oh, no, no, no. ##</i>

314
00:16:20,512 --> 00:16:22,673
Oh, no, no, no! 

315
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:35,255
Hey, where'd you
disappear to after school?

316
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,318
What are you, my keeper?

317
00:16:37,396 --> 00:16:38,829
<i>No, I was just looking
for you, that's all.</i>

318
00:16:38,897 --> 00:16:40,524
Don't look for me.

319
00:16:40,599 --> 00:16:41,793
What are you
getting stupid for?

320
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,297
Hey, you know something?

321
00:16:47,473 --> 00:16:48,633
You look kind of guilty.

322
00:16:49,908 --> 00:16:51,637
Did you do something wrong?

323
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:53,974
Get out of here.

324
00:16:54,046 --> 00:16:57,743
Hey, did you
do something... Gay?

325
00:16:57,816 --> 00:17:01,343
We connected in this
like, sci-fi moment.

326
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,648
It was like...

327
00:17:06,925 --> 00:17:08,119
Yes.

328
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:14,063
We're both alike, we're
both "homo senturions. "

329
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:16,124
Both aliens.

330
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:17,361
Do you feel like
an alien, Dorian?

331
00:17:17,436 --> 00:17:18,528
<i>Yes.
Do you?</i>

332
00:17:18,604 --> 00:17:19,400
Not any more.

333
00:17:19,471 --> 00:17:21,666
- How long did it take you.
- A few years maybe.

334
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:24,402
Well, uh, I don't
have a few years, doc.

335
00:17:24,476 --> 00:17:26,569
I've got to go to
N YU in the fall.

336
00:17:26,645 --> 00:17:28,943
You've got to get
me adjusted and now.

337
00:17:29,014 --> 00:17:31,175
Plus, I can't afford
all of these sessions...

338
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,911
I'm dipping into my
savings for this.

339
00:17:32,985 --> 00:17:33,815
Relax.

340
00:17:34,453 --> 00:17:35,351
We'll do our best.

341
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:36,911
Oh, there's a
great doctor line;

342
00:17:36,989 --> 00:17:39,219
<i>"relax, we'll do our best".</i>

343
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:42,089
<i>Usually followed by
"Sorry, we did all we could. "</i>

344
00:17:42,161 --> 00:17:44,288
What do you love most
about yourself, Dorian?

345
00:17:44,363 --> 00:17:46,490
U h, I have a good heart.

346
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:47,896
And what do you
dislike the most?

347
00:17:47,966 --> 00:17:49,934
Um, my anxiety.

348
00:17:50,002 --> 00:17:51,629
What do you love the
most about your father.

349
00:17:51,703 --> 00:17:54,729
Oh, I see the questions get
progressively more difficult.

350
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:55,933
Why don't you tell
him that you're gay?

351
00:17:56,008 --> 00:17:59,341
Because, it would be the
ugliest moment of my life...

352
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:02,141
...and I am not that strong.

353
00:18:02,214 --> 00:18:03,238
See that dummy over there?

354
00:18:04,783 --> 00:18:06,944
- Know who that is?
- My father?

355
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:08,543
Very good.

356
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:11,714
I'd like for you to go over there
and tell him that you're gay.

357
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:15,089
Just... Talk to him.

358
00:18:26,638 --> 00:18:27,536
Hey Dad.

359
00:18:29,074 --> 00:18:29,870
What?

360
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,705
He says now's
not a good time.

361
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:36,505
Hey Dad, this is
Dr. Mitchener.

362
00:18:36,582 --> 00:18:39,483
- I'm not here.
- Oh, all right.

363
00:18:41,753 --> 00:18:45,814
Dad, I've been seeing
this Dr. Mitchener...

364
00:18:45,891 --> 00:18:50,988
...and he... Uh, he's a doctor
of psychology, I think.

365
00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:54,726
U h, right, not an M.D. Uh...

366
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:58,695
I don't know why he
didn't go all the way.

367
00:18:58,770 --> 00:18:59,327
OK.

368
00:18:59,404 --> 00:19:00,371
Annoying, isn't he?

369
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:02,634
Yeah, but he's not
going to speak...

370
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:04,471
...he's just going to listen.

371
00:19:04,543 --> 00:19:06,067
All right.

372
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:09,808
Dad, I just wanted you to
know that I am...

373
00:19:09,882 --> 00:19:14,945
...ummm... Uh...

374
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:17,386
Dad, umm...

375
00:19:17,456 --> 00:19:19,356
Got some work to do, huh?

376
00:19:29,134 --> 00:19:32,262
Did you ever get to spend any
time alone with your father...

377
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:33,463
...just you and him?

378
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:37,703
Well... There was the time
he taught me how to drive.

379
00:19:41,213 --> 00:19:42,874
- Know what you did wrong?
- No.

380
00:19:42,948 --> 00:19:44,916
- You were driving too fast.
- No, Dad.

381
00:19:44,983 --> 00:19:46,211
I was going the speed limit.

382
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:48,446
That speed limit is for
experienced drivers...

383
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,454
...under ideal conditions.

384
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:52,752
Not you, on a wet road.

385
00:19:52,824 --> 00:19:55,190
To be fair, it is
nerve-wracking...

386
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:57,285
...for any parent to teach
their child to drive.

387
00:19:57,362 --> 00:19:58,989
I don't know, he
also taught N icky.

388
00:20:05,737 --> 00:20:11,698
I got to tell you, N icky... You have
the reflexes of a race car driver.

389
00:20:11,777 --> 00:20:12,402
Doesn't he?

390
00:20:12,844 --> 00:20:13,640
Doesn't he?

391
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:24,417
I want you to explore this
first major anxiety episode.

392
00:20:24,489 --> 00:20:26,286
- You were seven.
- Yes.

393
00:20:26,358 --> 00:20:28,417
You initially went to your
mother with this fear.

394
00:20:28,493 --> 00:20:30,154
- Mommy?
- Yes sweetie?

395
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:32,220
- I'm scared.
- What are you scared of?

396
00:20:32,297 --> 00:20:33,491
Going to war.

397
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:36,625
But there is no war, honey.
Vietnam's over.

398
00:20:36,702 --> 00:20:39,364
Mrs. Tilly says there's
always another war...

399
00:20:39,438 --> 00:20:41,133
...and then maybe I'm old enough.

400
00:20:41,206 --> 00:20:43,367
If there's another war,
then you don't have to go.

401
00:20:43,442 --> 00:20:44,636
Really, how come?

402
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:47,679
Cause we would all pack our bags
and move straight up to Canada.

403
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:50,112
- Where's Canada?
- Up north.

404
00:20:50,182 --> 00:20:53,982
And they don't have
wars there, just moose.

405
00:20:55,187 --> 00:20:56,814
- What is it?
- Dad's coming.

406
00:20:57,789 --> 00:21:01,156
So, don't want to
go to war, huh?

407
00:21:01,226 --> 00:21:04,093
Amen.
I can understand.

408
00:21:04,162 --> 00:21:06,960
So what do you think instead?
Going up to Canada?

409
00:21:07,032 --> 00:21:09,557
Mom says Canada
doesn't have wars.

410
00:21:09,635 --> 00:21:11,159
No, no, they don't have wars.

411
00:21:11,236 --> 00:21:13,761
They don't have wars
because they have us.

412
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:17,002
We're their line of defense
against the Communists.

413
00:21:17,743 --> 00:21:21,270
But, what do you think might
happen if the Communists...

414
00:21:21,346 --> 00:21:23,507
...ever got wind of the fact
that all our young men...

415
00:21:23,582 --> 00:21:28,178
...would rather run up to Canada
than stay and defend this country?

416
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:31,278
They might get it into their
head that they could just...

417
00:21:31,356 --> 00:21:35,053
...have Texas and Oklahoma,
just for the asking.

418
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:37,652
And then Virginia,
Pennsylvania...

419
00:21:37,729 --> 00:21:40,789
...then New York and at that
point what would stop them...

420
00:21:40,866 --> 00:21:44,131
...from running right on
up into Canada as well...

421
00:21:44,202 --> 00:21:48,434
...looking for the likes of you,
and shooting you...

422
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,102
...right in the belly?

423
00:21:55,247 --> 00:22:00,207
No, you're not
going to Canada.

424
00:22:00,285 --> 00:22:02,879
You're going to war.

425
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:10,561
And you may get killed, but
you'll get killed like a man...

426
00:22:10,629 --> 00:22:11,561
...for your country.

427
00:22:49,835 --> 00:22:51,860
Dad, I'm gay.

428
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:02,070
I love you.

429
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:07,751
It's a common development.

430
00:23:07,819 --> 00:23:09,047
I thought that's
what you'd say.

431
00:23:09,121 --> 00:23:10,679
What did you want me to
say, that I love you too?

432
00:23:10,756 --> 00:23:11,688
Maybe.

433
00:23:11,757 --> 00:23:13,349
All right, Dorian.
I love you too.

434
00:23:13,425 --> 00:23:16,326
Not like that, not like
you love all of mankind...

435
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:17,828
...and I just happen to
be one of them.

436
00:23:23,935 --> 00:23:26,096
Besides the fact that
you're a virgin, craving...

437
00:23:26,171 --> 00:23:30,437
...a first experience and that
you feel safe with me...

438
00:23:30,509 --> 00:23:33,774
...besides those things, what
exactly do you love about me?

439
00:23:35,847 --> 00:23:38,475
I guess that's
pretty much it.

440
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:40,279
I'm still flattered.

441
00:23:40,352 --> 00:23:44,083
However, I do not under any
circumstances sleep with my clients.

442
00:23:46,491 --> 00:23:48,584
Could you maybe refer
me to someone who does?

443
00:24:41,546 --> 00:24:44,674
Forgive me father, it's been
awhile since my last confession...

444
00:24:44,749 --> 00:24:48,947
...and uh, I've done some
of the usual sins, I guess.

445
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:51,488
I've disrespected my father
which to be honest...

446
00:24:51,556 --> 00:24:54,821
I don't think I'm ever
going to stop but uh...

447
00:24:54,893 --> 00:24:58,920
...something bigger this time,
I kind of had sex.

448
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:03,696
Well, that's a serious sin, but it
is common within your age group.

449
00:25:03,768 --> 00:25:04,826
With a guy.

450
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:09,097
- Pretty big sin, huh?
- Yes it is.

451
00:25:14,813 --> 00:25:16,303
Why?
Why is it a sin?

452
00:25:16,381 --> 00:25:17,405
Go back to your side.

453
00:25:17,482 --> 00:25:18,813
I don't want to go
back to my side.

454
00:25:18,884 --> 00:25:20,909
Please Father.
Come on, you know it's me.

455
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:27,355
It's a sin because it
says so in the Bible...

456
00:25:27,425 --> 00:25:28,983
...and the Bible is
the word of God.

457
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:31,688
But how do you know every bit
of it is the word of God.

458
00:25:31,763 --> 00:25:33,355
I know it on faith.

459
00:25:33,431 --> 00:25:36,264
A faith which comes from
years of research and prayer.

460
00:25:36,334 --> 00:25:38,359
Both of which I suggest
you begin immediately.

461
00:25:38,436 --> 00:25:39,198
I don't know, Father.

462
00:25:39,271 --> 00:25:41,034
I'm not convinced I've
done anything wrong.

463
00:25:41,106 --> 00:25:42,733
If you didn't do
anything wrong...

464
00:25:42,807 --> 00:25:45,071
...then why do you suppose you
feel so guilty about it?

465
00:25:45,143 --> 00:25:46,303
What's guilt prove?

466
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:48,744
I mean, I feel guilty when
there's mud slides in Ecuador.

467
00:25:48,813 --> 00:25:50,872
Even if it weren't wrong,
would you really like to...

468
00:25:50,949 --> 00:25:53,349
...live a life style which means
you could never get married...

469
00:25:53,418 --> 00:25:54,385
...never have children?

470
00:25:54,452 --> 00:25:55,384
No, I want children.

471
00:25:55,453 --> 00:25:57,216
Then you haven't
thought this through.

472
00:25:57,289 --> 00:25:58,916
But maybe I don't
get children.

473
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:00,480
Don't be so sure.

474
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,527
Often with a little
prayer and effort...

475
00:26:02,594 --> 00:26:05,654
...those in your situation find
that they can desire women.

476
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:07,163
- Really?
- Absolutely.

477
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,597
I've been counseling
for years.

478
00:26:08,667 --> 00:26:11,329
The first man I talked to was
convinced he couldn't be helped.

479
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:14,236
Today he lives in Ohio with
his wife of fourteen years...

480
00:26:14,306 --> 00:26:15,500
...and their nine children.

481
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:17,405
- N ine?
- Amen, nine.

482
00:26:17,475 --> 00:26:19,375
He called them his own
little baseball team.

483
00:26:19,444 --> 00:26:21,207
Even got them uniforms.

484
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:23,304
You should see them,
they're cute as hell.

485
00:26:40,966 --> 00:26:44,231
Hello, Dr. Mitchener?
This is Dorian Legatis.

486
00:26:44,302 --> 00:26:48,398
I just wanted you to know I
won't be needing any more sessions.

487
00:26:48,473 --> 00:26:50,668
I've found another path.

488
00:26:50,742 --> 00:26:56,738
But I wish you luck on
your journey and... Amen.

489
00:27:01,886 --> 00:27:05,253
- I love you, Dad.
- Ah.

490
00:27:33,385 --> 00:27:34,215
<i>Nicky.</i>

491
00:27:36,021 --> 00:27:36,749
<i>Nicky.</i>

492
00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:39,654
- What?
- I can't do it anymore.

493
00:27:39,724 --> 00:27:41,453
- Do what?
- It's wrong to be gay...

494
00:27:41,526 --> 00:27:42,720
...to act on it, anyway.

495
00:27:42,794 --> 00:27:44,921
<i>It's even wrong to have some
of the gay thoughts I'm thinking.</i>

496
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:46,395
It's wrong to even think?

497
00:27:46,464 --> 00:27:48,864
Yes.
"Thou shalt not covet. 

498
00:27:48,933 --> 00:27:51,026
It's the tenth commandment:
Thou shalt not covet...

499
00:27:51,102 --> 00:27:53,627
...thy neighbor's wife,"
let alone thy neighbor.

500
00:27:53,705 --> 00:27:55,570
- What have you been reading?
- The Holy Bible.

501
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,005
What the hell are you
reading that for, man?

502
00:27:57,075 --> 00:27:58,474
I haven't read that
since grade school.

503
00:27:58,543 --> 00:27:59,441
Well, you should.

504
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:01,342
It's mostly about straight
sex, and believe me...

505
00:28:01,413 --> 00:28:02,812
...you're in some deep shit too.

506
00:28:02,881 --> 00:28:05,441
Well, we're all sinners, right?
- Yes, that's right.

507
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:08,645
So then I'll keep on sinning
till I'm like, thirty...

508
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,950
...and then I'll repent
and take up golf.

509
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:12,011
Isn't that how it works?

510
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:13,352
But what if you don't
live till thirty?

511
00:28:13,425 --> 00:28:15,325
What if you die
tonight in your sleep?

512
00:28:15,393 --> 00:28:17,020
Look, Dor, if I'm so
screwed being straight...

513
00:28:17,095 --> 00:28:18,892
...then what are you worried
about being gay for?

514
00:28:18,963 --> 00:28:20,624
Cause I decided that
I want to have kids.

515
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:22,030
<i>Oh, well that's over.</i>

516
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,863
Don't say that's over, don't
you dare say that's over...

517
00:28:23,935 --> 00:28:25,334
...it's what I want more than
anything in the whole world.

518
00:28:25,403 --> 00:28:26,495
- All right, all right.
- I want kids.

519
00:28:26,571 --> 00:28:27,094
Shhh.

520
00:28:27,172 --> 00:28:28,833
And not just one or two of
them, a whole mess of them...

521
00:28:28,907 --> 00:28:30,238
...my own little baseball team.

522
00:28:30,308 --> 00:28:33,709
- Base... You hate baseball.
- Yes, but I love uniforms.

523
00:28:33,778 --> 00:28:35,507
So I need your help.

524
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:38,242
I want you to teach me
how to think straight.

525
00:28:38,316 --> 00:28:40,045
You want me to teach you?

526
00:28:40,118 --> 00:28:42,484
Yeah, I want to turn this
around so bad and I've been...

527
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:44,886
...thinking that if someone
like you could teach me...

528
00:28:44,956 --> 00:28:47,754
...how you think sexually, you know,
maybe I could reboot my brain.

529
00:28:47,826 --> 00:28:49,191
You want to turn this around?
- Yes.

530
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:51,194
- Seriously?
- I've never been more serious.

531
00:28:51,262 --> 00:28:52,593
Cause I have had some
thoughts on this.

532
00:28:52,664 --> 00:28:53,289
You have?

533
00:28:53,364 --> 00:28:55,161
Absolutely, I mean I didn't
want to push them on you...

534
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:57,497
...but if you're coming to me
I'll shoot straight with you.

535
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:59,434
I think I can get this
monkey off your back.

536
00:28:59,504 --> 00:29:01,631
I knew it.
Tell me what I have to do.

537
00:29:01,706 --> 00:29:03,173
Now?
- Yes, now.

538
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:05,709
We're both up, start helping
me get this monkey off now.

539
00:29:05,777 --> 00:29:07,938
Oh, thank you, thank
you, thank you.

540
00:29:08,012 --> 00:29:10,674
Oh my God, wouldn't it be
fabulous if this were just...

541
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:12,410
...the answer to the
whole problem?

542
00:29:12,484 --> 00:29:15,885
First things first,
don't ever say fabulous.

543
00:29:15,954 --> 00:29:17,717
No?
- No, it's not a straight word.

544
00:29:17,789 --> 00:29:18,483
Oh.

545
00:29:18,556 --> 00:29:20,183
Never heard one of my
friends say fabulous.

546
00:29:20,258 --> 00:29:22,226
- Oh, OK.
- Well what do I say instead?

547
00:29:22,293 --> 00:29:24,693
U h, say...

548
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:25,661
...awesome.

549
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:27,197
OK.

550
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:32,567
It's awesome.
That would be awesome.

551
00:29:32,637 --> 00:29:34,605
- OK.
- It's awesome, man.

552
00:29:34,672 --> 00:29:35,229
Good.

553
00:29:35,306 --> 00:29:36,603
I know, it feels good,
I like it.

554
00:29:36,674 --> 00:29:38,539
- It's fucking awesome.
- That's it.

555
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:39,235
Yeah.

556
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:40,504
All right, let's go
down to the basement.

557
00:29:40,578 --> 00:29:41,875
What are we going to
do in the basement?

558
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:42,913
We're gonna fight.

559
00:29:49,554 --> 00:29:51,852
- Did you say fight?
- Yup.

560
00:29:51,923 --> 00:29:54,915
- Actually fight.
- Actually, physically fight.

561
00:29:54,993 --> 00:29:56,221
You're going to teach
me how to fight.

562
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:58,194
No, not teach, just fight.

563
00:29:58,263 --> 00:29:59,855
If you happen to pick up
some pointers along the way...

564
00:29:59,931 --> 00:30:01,057
...good for you.

565
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:02,690
I don't understand.

566
00:30:02,767 --> 00:30:05,736
See you want me to help you,
this is how we start.

567
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:08,500
We mix it up, mano y mano.

568
00:30:08,573 --> 00:30:11,235
OK, but I think
we're short a mano.

569
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:14,745
See that's just it.
You're a pussy.

570
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:17,748
- You've always been a pussy.
- Ouch.

571
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:24,679
This is for real?

572
00:30:24,756 --> 00:30:26,087
Can't be straight if
you're a chicken shit.

573
00:30:28,059 --> 00:30:29,151
I'm not a chicken shit.

574
00:30:42,707 --> 00:30:43,571
Stand up.

575
00:30:44,976 --> 00:30:47,308
Ok.
Now drive your elbow back.

576
00:30:47,378 --> 00:30:49,039
The other one.

577
00:30:49,113 --> 00:30:50,171
There you go.

578
00:30:50,248 --> 00:30:51,237
OK.

579
00:30:51,316 --> 00:30:54,410
OK, tough guy, you
wanna see something?

580
00:30:54,485 --> 00:30:55,577
Please.

581
00:30:55,653 --> 00:30:57,086
- You want to see what I've got?
- I'm waiting.

582
00:30:57,155 --> 00:30:58,884
- You might be surprised.
- Surprise me.

583
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:22,974
Come on, Dorian,
it was just a jab.

584
00:31:23,748 --> 00:31:25,079
I didn't see it coming.

585
00:31:25,149 --> 00:31:30,451
OK, OK, relax, relax,
elbows in, take it easy...

586
00:31:30,521 --> 00:31:32,079
...just breathe.

587
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:34,752
<i>Ah-ha!</i>

588
00:31:34,826 --> 00:31:39,126
Faked you out, jock boy!
Not hurt at all.

589
00:31:39,197 --> 00:31:42,360
Oh, what's the matter Rambo?
Hurt your little thumb?

590
00:31:42,433 --> 00:31:43,365
You sneaky little...

591
00:31:43,434 --> 00:31:44,492
Sneaky?

592
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:47,129
I don't think sneaky's
a straight word, bro.

593
00:31:47,205 --> 00:31:48,934
Try ballsy.

594
00:31:49,007 --> 00:31:51,373
Aaaaaah!
Diiiiieeee!

595
00:31:53,177 --> 00:31:55,509
Oooh, shit!
You alright?

596
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,070
Dor?
Dor?

597
00:32:00,385 --> 00:32:02,285
Look, I am trying to
help you, allright?

598
00:32:02,353 --> 00:32:05,254
- So please don't embarrass me.
- Embarrass you?

599
00:32:06,157 --> 00:32:07,715
Look at what I'm wearing.

600
00:32:07,792 --> 00:32:09,692
Will you stop milking that?

601
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:11,888
Milk?
It was a concussion!

602
00:32:11,963 --> 00:32:14,488
- And there was blood!
- It was an accident!

603
00:32:14,565 --> 00:32:17,830
Just forget about it and concentrate
on acting like a real guy.

604
00:32:21,673 --> 00:32:26,508
Kiss me here, 'cause I've
got the dirt on you my dear. 

605
00:32:26,577 --> 00:32:33,415
It's your turn to hurt so kiss me
here I'm gonna make you pay. 

606
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:36,846
What's your name?

607
00:32:36,921 --> 00:32:38,115
Tiffany.

608
00:32:38,189 --> 00:32:42,649
And it's clear
you're not too brilliant. 

609
00:32:42,727 --> 00:32:47,790
Kiss me here, go
on and make my day. 

610
00:32:47,865 --> 00:32:52,700
Oh... Oh my... Easy,
I'm nursing a concussion.

611
00:32:55,573 --> 00:32:57,803
- You like her?
- I like her shoes.

612
00:32:57,875 --> 00:33:00,503
No, her.
Do you like her?

613
00:33:00,578 --> 00:33:03,376
Actually, I think
she's quite sensuous.

614
00:33:03,448 --> 00:33:04,915
Excellent.

615
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:07,008
<i>Where have you been?
I've been sitting here...</i>

616
00:33:07,085 --> 00:33:08,780
Been talking to that
dancer, Tiffany.

617
00:33:08,853 --> 00:33:10,548
- She's agreed to help us out.
- What does that mean?

618
00:33:10,621 --> 00:33:12,555
It means she's gonna
sleep with you bro.

619
00:33:12,623 --> 00:33:13,817
Tonight.

620
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:16,050
You're full of it.
- No, I'm serious.

621
00:33:16,127 --> 00:33:17,822
- I don't believe you.
- Believe it, Dor.

622
00:33:17,895 --> 00:33:21,058
She gets off work at two,
you show up at her place at 2:30...

623
00:33:21,132 --> 00:33:24,226
...by 2:35, this
virgin shit is over.

624
00:33:24,302 --> 00:33:25,792
- This is for real?
- Totally for real.

625
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:26,837
Oh, my God.

626
00:33:27,939 --> 00:33:29,998
Oh, my God.

627
00:33:31,209 --> 00:33:34,303
Well, to tell you the truth I
don't know how I feel about this.

628
00:33:34,379 --> 00:33:35,903
Feel great about it,
all right?

629
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:38,471
And do us both a favor,
don't over think it.

630
00:33:38,549 --> 00:33:40,779
I won't, but I'm just so...
- No, you got to do this, Dor.

631
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:41,910
This is what's gonna
make the difference.

632
00:33:41,986 --> 00:33:43,453
- I hope so but...
- No buts, OK?

633
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:44,180
OK.
- OK?

634
00:33:44,255 --> 00:33:45,085
Yeah, OK!

635
00:33:46,791 --> 00:33:47,780
Wow.

636
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:49,049
Wow.

637
00:33:51,162 --> 00:33:52,789
So I guess she kind
of liked me, huh...

638
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:54,354
I mean enough to
want to, you know...

639
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:56,093
Yeah, for a hundred
bucks she liked you fine.

640
00:33:56,167 --> 00:33:58,499
What?
You paid her a hundred bucks.

641
00:33:58,569 --> 00:34:00,628
Hey relax, this
is totally on me.

642
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:02,502
Oh my God, N icky.

643
00:34:02,573 --> 00:34:04,404
It's not the money,
it's the principle.

644
00:34:04,475 --> 00:34:05,772
What principles have you got?

645
00:34:05,843 --> 00:34:07,333
You're between
this and sodomy.

646
00:34:07,412 --> 00:34:09,141
You set me up with a hooker.

647
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:12,080
She's not a hooker, she's a dancer
who does some of this on the side.

648
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:16,052
- So she's a part-time hooker.
- She's a lovely, sensuous girl.

649
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,587
- You said so yourself.
- All right!

650
00:34:19,157 --> 00:34:23,059
So my first time will
be with a lovely...

651
00:34:23,127 --> 00:34:25,823
...sensuous dancer
named Tiffany.

652
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:30,129
Well, uh... Just so you know,
it's a stage name.

653
00:34:30,201 --> 00:34:33,068
These dancers pick sexy
sounding names for the dancing.

654
00:34:33,137 --> 00:34:34,764
- What's her real name?
- Bunny.

655
00:34:40,111 --> 00:34:40,907
Come on in.

656
00:34:52,723 --> 00:34:55,886
- You're all sweaty.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

657
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,052
It's all right.

658
00:34:57,128 --> 00:35:00,154
U h, I have deodorant on,
just not antiperspirant.

659
00:35:00,231 --> 00:35:01,163
It's OK.

660
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:05,999
I, I didn't want to
wear this for this.

661
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:08,129
- Should I throw it out?
- Yeah.

662
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:17,505
Can I get you something
cold to drink?

663
00:35:17,582 --> 00:35:20,346
U h, does it cost extra?

664
00:35:20,418 --> 00:35:21,783
No.
- Sure.

665
00:35:36,167 --> 00:35:37,759
- Getting ready?
- No, uh.

666
00:35:37,835 --> 00:35:38,995
It's OK.
Stay.

667
00:35:46,911 --> 00:35:48,469
You know, I don't
mind that you're gay.

668
00:35:50,014 --> 00:35:51,174
No, no.

669
00:35:51,249 --> 00:35:55,618
What I mean is, I'm usually
not attracted to the guys I'm with...

670
00:35:55,686 --> 00:36:00,851
...so, um, if you're not attracted
to me then everything's even.

671
00:36:00,925 --> 00:36:02,859
That's not it, it...

672
00:36:03,761 --> 00:36:04,284
What?

673
00:36:04,362 --> 00:36:08,355
It's just, I can't believe
what I've been reduced to...

674
00:36:08,432 --> 00:36:11,128
...someone who has to
pay for a sex life.

675
00:36:11,202 --> 00:36:12,499
I mean, I'm a romantic.

676
00:36:14,205 --> 00:36:15,536
How long have you
been doing this?

677
00:36:15,606 --> 00:36:16,595
About a year.

678
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:18,232
Why do you need
the money so badly?

679
00:36:18,309 --> 00:36:19,503
You got a crack
habit or something?

680
00:36:19,577 --> 00:36:21,568
No, no nothing like that.

681
00:36:21,646 --> 00:36:24,774
Actually, I'm saving to
move down to New York.

682
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:26,578
Really? What are you going
to do down there?

683
00:36:26,651 --> 00:36:28,619
- Try and be a singer.
- You sing?

684
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:32,144
And dance. I do some
vocal impersonations.

685
00:36:32,223 --> 00:36:36,387
Wow, you're multi-talented.
I wish I had one talent.

686
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:37,927
<i>I'm sure you have one.</i>

687
00:36:37,995 --> 00:36:39,986
Not unless you
count melancholy.

688
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:41,531
Got a gift for that.

689
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:47,901
Who do you do?
- Excuse me?

690
00:36:47,972 --> 00:36:49,701
You said you
impersonate singers?

691
00:36:49,774 --> 00:36:53,210
Oh... A lot of people.

692
00:36:53,277 --> 00:36:56,405
Well do one,
and let me guess.

693
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,914
No, I can't.
- Why not?

694
00:36:58,983 --> 00:37:00,746
Cause I'm embarrassed.

695
00:37:00,818 --> 00:37:03,116
You're embarrassed
to sing for me?

696
00:37:03,187 --> 00:37:05,052
Did you forget what
I came here for?

697
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:07,854
OK.

698
00:37:13,464 --> 00:37:19,403
I don't know why but
I'm feeling so sad. 

699
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:24,498
I long to try something
I've never had. 

700
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:31,640
Never had no kissin'.
Oh what I've been missin'. 

701
00:37:31,716 --> 00:37:39,555
Lover man, Lover man, 

702
00:37:39,624 --> 00:37:44,857
Where can you be? 

703
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:48,364
Billie Holiday.

704
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:51,401
- Very good.
- Very good yourself.

705
00:37:51,469 --> 00:37:54,529
- That was wonderful.
- Yeah, I love her.

706
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:56,470
- Do you know any country?
- Country?

707
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:57,939
Yeah, I love country.

708
00:37:58,009 --> 00:37:59,340
Please don't think
any less of me.

709
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:08,045
<i>## Worry. Why do I
let myself worry? ##</i>

710
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:16,686
Wondrin', what in
the world did I do? 

711
00:38:16,761 --> 00:38:22,757
I'm crazy for tryin'
and crazy for cryin'.

712
00:38:22,833 --> 00:38:33,368
And I'm crazy for lovin' you. 

713
00:38:34,078 --> 00:38:36,205
No, no, no.
Oh, no, no.

714
00:38:38,282 --> 00:38:39,579
U h.

715
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:43,783
It's just, it's never
gonna happen for me.

716
00:38:43,854 --> 00:38:45,082
What?

717
00:38:46,957 --> 00:38:51,223
I just want to feel good,
you know, sometimes.

718
00:38:52,196 --> 00:38:54,164
I'm sick of being scared.

719
00:38:54,231 --> 00:38:57,496
I'm scared a lot of
the times myself.

720
00:38:57,568 --> 00:38:59,160
You are?
- Yeah.

721
00:38:59,236 --> 00:39:00,396
You wanna know
what I do about it?

722
00:39:00,471 --> 00:39:01,301
What?

723
00:39:01,372 --> 00:39:07,174
I pretend... Like I'm in one of
those big old Hollywood musicals.

724
00:39:07,244 --> 00:39:12,409
Where everyone's fine,
and happy, and in love.

725
00:39:12,483 --> 00:39:13,973
And I pretend
like I'm in love.

726
00:39:14,051 --> 00:39:16,212
I sing, I dance...

727
00:39:16,287 --> 00:39:19,620
- You delude yourself.
- Yeah, but it works.

728
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:22,181
Hey, you want to dance
with me right now.

729
00:39:22,259 --> 00:39:23,658
No, no, no.
It's a pick me up.

730
00:39:23,728 --> 00:39:25,218
I swear it always works.

731
00:39:25,296 --> 00:39:30,529
U h, I can't dance, I know it
sounds weird coming from a gay guy.

732
00:39:30,601 --> 00:39:32,364
You can dance,
everybody can dance.

733
00:39:32,436 --> 00:39:34,597
- Come on, I'll teach you.
- It's not that simple.

734
00:39:34,672 --> 00:39:36,640
No, it's that's simple.

735
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:39,471
Look, I don't know
where you're from...

736
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:41,875
...but you may have missed
a really important lesson.

737
00:39:41,946 --> 00:39:44,642
You want to feel good,
you gotta work at it.

738
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:46,114
Now get up.

739
00:39:46,183 --> 00:39:49,152
Well, feeling good for
me has never been simple...

740
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,711
...and learning a dance,
impossible.

741
00:39:51,789 --> 00:39:54,087
But Tiffany was convinced
that if you worked hard enough...

742
00:39:54,158 --> 00:39:56,888
...the universe
owed you an MGM moment.

743
00:39:56,961 --> 00:40:00,055
And work we did.
And you know what?

744
00:40:00,131 --> 00:40:03,032
Before the night was done,
the universe paid up.

745
00:40:32,329 --> 00:40:35,628
I left Tiffany's that night
knowing that I'd never be straight...

746
00:40:35,699 --> 00:40:38,065
...and that it was
time to tell everyone.

747
00:40:38,402 --> 00:40:39,391
This is bad.

748
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:43,532
This is really bad.

749
00:40:45,709 --> 00:40:46,971
You're actually going to do this.

750
00:40:50,514 --> 00:40:53,745
So tell me, Dor...
'cause I honestly don't understand.

751
00:40:54,385 --> 00:40:56,012
Where are you suddenly finding
the courage to do this?

752
00:40:56,086 --> 00:40:58,213
I mean, to this day you
still haven't been able to...

753
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:00,052
...tell them about that golf club
you broke that summer.

754
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:01,091
I know.

755
00:41:01,158 --> 00:41:03,319
- I may throw that in.
- He's going to go ballistic.

756
00:41:03,394 --> 00:41:05,760
Maybe, but afterwards,
he'll know who I am.

757
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:07,627
OK, he doesn't care
who you are, Dorian!

758
00:41:07,698 --> 00:41:09,290
He only cares who he is
and this will mean that...

759
00:41:09,366 --> 00:41:10,799
...he's the father
of a homosexual.

760
00:41:10,868 --> 00:41:12,392
And that's going to freak him out!

761
00:41:14,238 --> 00:41:16,206
Well, I'm not going
to be here for it.

762
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:21,001
You know, some families
actually grow stronger...

763
00:41:21,078 --> 00:41:22,204
...from this sort of thing.

764
00:41:22,279 --> 00:41:24,406
Oh yeah, we're a really
good candidate for that.

765
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:26,916
You tell your news,
Dad will drink til he drops...

766
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:28,611
...and Mom will be up until
two o'clock in the morning...

767
00:41:28,686 --> 00:41:31,154
...dusting knick-knacks and humming
to herself like a mental patient.

768
00:41:31,222 --> 00:41:33,486
Yeah, we're really going
to grow stronger.

769
00:41:36,927 --> 00:41:37,916
Don't you tell him I knew.

770
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:39,292
- I won't.
- I'm serious.

771
00:41:39,363 --> 00:41:40,990
- I didn't know a thing about it.
- I heard you.

772
00:41:48,973 --> 00:41:50,804
- I'm going to Walsh's.
- What's all the yelling about?

773
00:41:50,875 --> 00:41:52,137
Nothing.
Where are my keys?

774
00:41:52,209 --> 00:41:53,233
Wherever you left them.

775
00:42:19,236 --> 00:42:21,932
You're not wearing a
a pink shirt, are you?

776
00:42:22,006 --> 00:42:23,030
No, it's fuchsia.

777
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:27,040
Got a minute, dad?

778
00:42:34,251 --> 00:42:37,379
Stupid, stupid,
stupid, stupid.

779
00:42:37,454 --> 00:42:38,921
Idiot!

780
00:42:50,768 --> 00:42:54,431
Son, you don't even know
the meaning of the word.

781
00:42:54,505 --> 00:42:56,473
I don't know what
the word 'gay' means?

782
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:58,599
- I doubt it.
- Well, you're wrong.

783
00:42:58,676 --> 00:43:01,236
<i>- What's it mean?
- It means, I like men.</i>

784
00:43:01,312 --> 00:43:02,904
Not you, maybe,
but in general.

785
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:05,881
You hear the
anger there... Huh?

786
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:07,850
See that's the crux
to all of this.

787
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:11,115
You're so angry at me you'd do
anything to try and shock me.

788
00:43:11,188 --> 00:43:13,179
Of course I'm angry at you,
because you've never had...

789
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:14,747
...anything but contempt for me.

790
00:43:14,825 --> 00:43:16,122
Think this is gonna help?

791
00:43:16,193 --> 00:43:18,593
- This isn't about you.
- I think it is.

792
00:43:18,662 --> 00:43:20,186
Do you think I made this up?

793
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:21,925
No, I think you probably
worked yourself up...

794
00:43:21,999 --> 00:43:23,398
...into half believing it too.

795
00:43:23,467 --> 00:43:25,628
I more than half
believe it, Dad.

796
00:43:25,703 --> 00:43:26,499
I know it.

797
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:29,767
You don't know horse
shit, you hear me?

798
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:31,535
You're so fogged up
in that head of yours...

799
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:33,099
...you don't know horse shit.

800
00:43:33,177 --> 00:43:37,409
This is some fantasy you've
cooked up to feel eccentric.

801
00:43:37,481 --> 00:43:39,039
Well I've got news for you.

802
00:43:39,116 --> 00:43:42,381
There's a world of difference
between being eccentric...

803
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:44,216
...and being perverted.

804
00:43:46,390 --> 00:43:47,914
Back to the drawing board.

805
00:43:48,892 --> 00:43:49,916
Fantasy?

806
00:43:49,994 --> 00:43:52,326
Before graduation I slept
with a guy at school.

807
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:00,126
Then congratulations...

808
00:44:02,973 --> 00:44:04,304
...you have shocked me.

809
00:44:04,375 --> 00:44:05,603
I didn't tell
you to shock you.

810
00:44:05,676 --> 00:44:07,974
No, no.
Don't speak.

811
00:44:08,045 --> 00:44:11,139
Don't open your mouth until
I ask you a direct question.

812
00:44:11,215 --> 00:44:12,307
Is that clear?

813
00:44:14,518 --> 00:44:16,315
Is that clear?
- Yes sir.

814
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:18,917
Good.

815
00:44:25,129 --> 00:44:28,792
Now what I want to know is,
who else have you told this to?

816
00:44:28,866 --> 00:44:29,355
No one.

817
00:44:31,735 --> 00:44:34,101
- None of your friends?
- No.

818
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:35,763
- Your mother?
- No.

819
00:44:39,977 --> 00:44:41,911
- Your brother?
- No.

820
00:44:41,979 --> 00:44:42,809
Yes.

821
00:44:43,247 --> 00:44:45,238
I know about it,
Dad...

822
00:44:48,185 --> 00:44:49,117
...everything.

823
00:44:50,154 --> 00:44:52,588
You knew about this,
and you didn't tell me?

824
00:44:52,656 --> 00:44:54,123
Well I would have, Dad,
if I knew you were...

825
00:44:54,191 --> 00:44:55,317
...going to take it so well.

826
00:44:55,392 --> 00:44:56,916
<i>- This is funny.
- No, it isn't.</i>

827
00:44:56,994 --> 00:44:58,757
It's also not worth having
a heart attack over.

828
00:44:58,829 --> 00:45:01,297
Dad, I'm still the same
person I always was.

829
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:02,627
Which was never so hot.

830
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:04,224
Come on, Dad.
- Now hold it.

831
00:45:07,171 --> 00:45:09,298
You should never
have involved him...

832
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:10,863
...he's at a very
impressionable age.

833
00:45:10,941 --> 00:45:12,374
Oh, Jesus, Dad.

834
00:45:12,443 --> 00:45:14,502
This does not affect
your precious Nicky!

835
00:45:14,578 --> 00:45:15,943
I certainly hope not.
- Dad.

836
00:45:16,013 --> 00:45:17,605
Oh, so that's
the bottom line.

837
00:45:17,681 --> 00:45:19,842
You don't care if you have a
gay son as long as it's not him.

838
00:45:19,917 --> 00:45:21,714
Don't tell me
what I care about.

839
00:45:21,785 --> 00:45:22,945
Dad, will you
guys just relax?

840
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:24,988
- It's your problem.
- It's no big deal!

841
00:45:27,324 --> 00:45:28,188
What isn't?

842
00:45:29,626 --> 00:45:30,524
Being gay.

843
00:45:31,495 --> 00:45:32,154
It isn't.

844
00:45:32,229 --> 00:45:35,164
It's just, you know,
another way to go.

845
00:45:38,469 --> 00:45:39,834
I never told him that, Dad.

846
00:45:44,341 --> 00:45:46,536
- Get out.
- No, Dad.

847
00:45:46,610 --> 00:45:49,602
- You don't live here any more.
- Fine.

848
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:51,841
What the hell is going on?
- Get the hell out of here!

849
00:45:51,915 --> 00:45:53,177
- What's going on?
- Dorian!

850
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:54,410
He's out of here,
it's his problem.

851
00:45:54,485 --> 00:45:56,612
Just a second Dad.
Dad!

852
00:45:56,687 --> 00:45:58,245
Get your hands off me!

853
00:45:59,223 --> 00:46:00,850
What, are you
turning faggy too?

854
00:46:11,802 --> 00:46:13,326
Is this really how
you're gonna move out?

855
00:46:13,403 --> 00:46:15,871
Well, I would have
preferred a cake, but...

856
00:46:17,841 --> 00:46:19,604
He's gonna cool off a
lot by tomorrow, Dor.

857
00:46:19,676 --> 00:46:21,735
I'm not gonna be
here tomorrow, OK?

858
00:46:21,812 --> 00:46:23,177
I just called the cab.

859
00:46:23,247 --> 00:46:24,805
I'm going to Aunt Beth's in
five minutes and tomorrow...

860
00:46:24,882 --> 00:46:26,179
I'm going down to school early.

861
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:27,683
And what if you're not
happy down in New York?

862
00:46:27,751 --> 00:46:29,309
How could I not be
happy in New York?

863
00:46:29,386 --> 00:46:30,944
New York's the greatest
city in the world.

864
00:46:31,021 --> 00:46:32,181
You always say that...

865
00:46:32,256 --> 00:46:33,848
...how do you know what the
greatest city in the world is?

866
00:46:33,924 --> 00:46:35,653
The only other city
you've been to is Utica.

867
00:46:35,726 --> 00:46:38,752
What about mom?
- You fill her in, I'll call.

868
00:46:38,829 --> 00:46:40,456
I don't want some sort
of weird scene now.

869
00:46:40,531 --> 00:46:42,089
Do you want this, it's
yours but I use it.

870
00:46:43,333 --> 00:46:44,800
Man, she's gonna
be heart-broken.

871
00:46:44,868 --> 00:46:47,336
She'll be rolling pennies,
she won't even notice.

872
00:46:47,404 --> 00:46:48,371
That's not fair.

873
00:46:49,606 --> 00:46:51,972
You, you know
about fair, N ick?

874
00:46:52,042 --> 00:46:55,034
Well why don't you,
favorite son...

875
00:46:55,112 --> 00:46:57,239
quarterback king with
a big Dick to boot...

876
00:46:57,314 --> 00:46:59,043
...tell me about fair.

877
00:47:01,051 --> 00:47:02,780
And good luck here alone.

878
00:47:36,119 --> 00:47:37,450
October 21 st

879
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:41,252
Dear Nicky, was I ever
right about this city.

880
00:47:41,325 --> 00:47:42,815
It's wonderful.

881
00:47:42,893 --> 00:47:44,451
What did I always talk about?

882
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:47,395
Culture, museums, theater...

883
00:47:47,464 --> 00:47:49,557
God, I've found
myself here, Nick.

884
00:47:49,633 --> 00:47:51,066
And, others like me.

885
00:47:51,134 --> 00:47:53,227
- You know what I don't get?
- Tell us.

886
00:47:53,303 --> 00:47:56,670
OK. Why the pope rides around
in a bullet-proof car.

887
00:47:56,740 --> 00:47:58,002
I just don't get that.

888
00:47:58,075 --> 00:48:00,043
I mean, what is he
afraid of, eternal bliss?

889
00:48:01,912 --> 00:48:02,936
That's Ellie.

890
00:48:03,013 --> 00:48:05,880
She's opinionated,
lesbian, and Jewish.

891
00:48:05,949 --> 00:48:08,281
Everything Dad looks
for in a woman.

892
00:48:08,352 --> 00:48:09,683
The guy's Andrew.

893
00:48:09,753 --> 00:48:11,687
Also gay, with
a big crush on me.

894
00:48:11,755 --> 00:48:13,382
Dorian do you want
anything, on me?

895
00:48:13,457 --> 00:48:14,355
No thanks.

896
00:48:14,424 --> 00:48:16,358
I'm not interested,
but he persists.

897
00:48:16,426 --> 00:48:18,553
- You sure, split an iced tea?
- No thanks.

898
00:48:18,629 --> 00:48:19,857
Newspaper or a candy bar?

899
00:48:19,930 --> 00:48:21,693
No thanks,
no thanks, no thanks.

900
00:48:25,335 --> 00:48:26,199
You sure?

901
00:48:26,270 --> 00:48:28,204
Andrew's odd,
but we love him...

902
00:48:28,272 --> 00:48:30,399
...just as we all
love this city...

903
00:48:30,474 --> 00:48:32,237
...which I can now say
from experience...

904
00:48:32,309 --> 00:48:34,607
...is the greatest city in the world.

905
00:48:34,678 --> 00:48:35,167
Dor.

906
00:48:38,515 --> 00:48:40,676
December 3.
Dear Nick.

907
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:45,211
This is, without a doubt, the
most disgusting city in the world.

908
00:48:45,289 --> 00:48:47,154
You see, you gotta
be here awhile...

909
00:48:47,224 --> 00:48:50,557
...then you begin to see
the seams, the sadness...

910
00:48:50,627 --> 00:48:53,391
...the filth, the loneliness...

911
00:48:53,463 --> 00:48:56,125
Anyway, can't wait
for Christmas.

912
00:48:56,199 --> 00:48:58,099
Family warmth and all that.

913
00:48:58,168 --> 00:48:59,294
Dor.

914
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:04,001
Coats go right in the hall.

915
00:49:04,074 --> 00:49:05,701
That's fine, just
dump them there.

916
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:07,038
Has he grown?

917
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:08,304
Look at this!

918
00:49:14,451 --> 00:49:18,148
Uh,ladies and gentleman,
could I have your attention please.

919
00:49:18,221 --> 00:49:21,213
I, I, I just have a
little announcement.

920
00:49:22,693 --> 00:49:24,524
Hello... Hey! Got a little
announcement to make.

921
00:49:26,463 --> 00:49:31,594
As most of you are aware, Nicky
has been applying to some colleges...

922
00:49:31,668 --> 00:49:35,729
...hoping that one of them might
let him play a little football.

923
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:38,798
At what level, we
could only hope...

924
00:49:38,875 --> 00:49:41,776
...and whether they would kick
in a little tuition money...

925
00:49:41,845 --> 00:49:43,676
...we could only dream.

926
00:49:43,747 --> 00:49:46,341
We received a little
letter here this morning.

927
00:49:50,053 --> 00:49:57,824
The thrust of which says that
my son, my flesh and blood...

928
00:49:57,894 --> 00:50:02,661
...will be playing
quarterback this fall...

929
00:50:02,733 --> 00:50:08,729
...on a full scholarship at
Syracuse U niversity, division 1!

930
00:50:08,805 --> 00:50:09,601
All right!

931
00:50:09,673 --> 00:50:11,038
Come on up here, son!

932
00:50:11,108 --> 00:50:13,167
No get up here, come
here, give me your hand.

933
00:50:13,243 --> 00:50:14,039
Congratulations.

934
00:50:14,878 --> 00:50:16,539
Hey, how about this kid!

935
00:50:18,081 --> 00:50:18,843
Thank you.

936
00:50:21,985 --> 00:50:22,644
What?

937
00:50:23,787 --> 00:50:24,947
Oh, OK, OK.

938
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:28,583
And, ladies and gentleman,
folks, my other son...

939
00:50:28,658 --> 00:50:33,925
Dorian has just completed his first
semester at N YU where he is a uh...

940
00:50:34,898 --> 00:50:37,731
...uh, excuse me Dorian...

941
00:50:37,801 --> 00:50:39,268
...what you're majoring in?

942
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:41,898
Undecided.

943
00:50:41,972 --> 00:50:43,132
Right.

944
00:50:43,206 --> 00:50:45,572
Where he is majoring
in indecision.

945
00:50:51,948 --> 00:50:54,781
I dive down and I set that bow
anchor down there and I check it...

946
00:50:54,851 --> 00:50:57,945
...and I set the stern
anchor and I come back...

947
00:50:58,021 --> 00:50:59,511
...and I see it's a turtle.

948
00:51:00,424 --> 00:51:02,722
- Hey.
- Congratulations.

949
00:51:02,793 --> 00:51:04,226
Thanks.

950
00:51:04,294 --> 00:51:08,025
Why didn't you tell me?
- You got home late, Dor.

951
00:51:08,098 --> 00:51:09,759
Plus I didn't know he
was going to pull this...

952
00:51:09,833 --> 00:51:11,232
...announcement stunt.

953
00:51:11,301 --> 00:51:13,360
Well, I'm happy for you.

954
00:51:13,437 --> 00:51:15,166
Bull, you wish I'd
get hit by a truck.

955
00:51:15,238 --> 00:51:17,672
Damn you, reading
my diary again.

956
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:19,265
Hey mom.
- Boys.

957
00:51:19,342 --> 00:51:22,470
Dorian, I read that story you
wrote for the school paper.

958
00:51:22,546 --> 00:51:24,446
I loved it.

959
00:51:24,514 --> 00:51:27,915
<i>"A Man Walking On The Beach. "
You're very talented.</i>

960
00:51:27,984 --> 00:51:29,542
I have two talented sons.

961
00:51:29,619 --> 00:51:31,610
Too bad my talent
doesn't pay tuition.

962
00:51:34,124 --> 00:51:37,321
Dorian, before I forget, did
I tell you I have a niece...

963
00:51:37,394 --> 00:51:38,361
...who lives in New York.

964
00:51:38,428 --> 00:51:39,190
No you didn't.

965
00:51:39,262 --> 00:51:41,389
Well I do.
She's gorgeous.

966
00:51:41,465 --> 00:51:45,162
And besides that,she is
the sweetest, smartest...

967
00:51:45,235 --> 00:51:47,430
...funniest girl you
could hope to meet.

968
00:51:47,504 --> 00:51:48,436
What do you think?

969
00:51:48,505 --> 00:51:50,564
Honestly, she doesn't
sound like my type.

970
00:51:58,582 --> 00:52:00,015
Whatever you want.

971
00:52:00,083 --> 00:52:01,243
I'm serious

972
00:52:04,287 --> 00:52:05,276
Hey, Dor.

973
00:52:06,323 --> 00:52:07,381
Hey.

974
00:52:17,534 --> 00:52:19,331
Are we still mad
at each other?

975
00:52:19,402 --> 00:52:20,733
What's that?

976
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:24,240
I said; are we still
mad at each other?

977
00:52:24,307 --> 00:52:25,672
I'm not mad.

978
00:52:25,742 --> 00:52:27,266
You haven't asked
me about school.

979
00:52:27,344 --> 00:52:31,110
Yeah, Mom filled me in.
Sounds like it's going well.

980
00:52:31,181 --> 00:52:33,411
- It's not a phase.
- What's that?

981
00:52:33,483 --> 00:52:36,714
It's not... A phase.

982
00:52:39,356 --> 00:52:41,654
Do you think you're ever
gonna be OK with who I am?

983
00:52:41,725 --> 00:52:45,821
Do I think I'm ever gonna be
OK with who you've chosen to be?

984
00:52:45,896 --> 00:52:46,590
Am.

985
00:52:46,663 --> 00:52:49,359
Now son, we both know
that's subject to opinion.

986
00:52:53,036 --> 00:52:56,631
No, never will be.

987
00:52:56,706 --> 00:53:01,700
<i>The sexual specifics
of that life style, uh...</i>

988
00:53:01,778 --> 00:53:06,044
...are just too unnatural for
me to ever be OK with it.

989
00:53:06,116 --> 00:53:07,743
God, you know what I hate?

990
00:53:07,817 --> 00:53:09,682
What's that?

991
00:53:09,753 --> 00:53:15,316
That I care what you think.
Because if I didn't... God!

992
00:53:17,661 --> 00:53:19,925
Well son...

993
00:53:19,996 --> 00:53:22,430
...part of being a
man in this world...

994
00:53:22,499 --> 00:53:26,492
...is making your own decisions and
then living with the consequences.

995
00:53:26,570 --> 00:53:29,198
You are a man now.

996
00:53:29,272 --> 00:53:31,001
I mean, you're old
enough to die in a war...

997
00:53:32,442 --> 00:53:34,672
...and you're old enough
to die in a bed too.

998
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:39,814
Is that what you're
worried about?

999
00:53:39,883 --> 00:53:44,752
Because I can relate to that,
but, I swear to God, Dad.

1000
00:53:44,821 --> 00:53:46,186
I'm gonna be so careful.

1001
00:53:46,256 --> 00:53:48,747
Oh yeah, 'careful',
funeral homes, these days...

1002
00:53:48,825 --> 00:53:50,520
...are truck-full of young men
who are careful, I mean...

1003
00:53:50,594 --> 00:53:53,119
Jesus, Dorian...

1004
00:53:53,196 --> 00:53:55,426
Do you want this disease?
Do you want AIDS?

1005
00:53:55,498 --> 00:53:58,023
That's it, I chose this
lifestyle because...

1006
00:53:58,101 --> 00:53:59,398
I felt left out of a plague.

1007
00:53:59,469 --> 00:54:01,460
Christ, I gotta wonder.
I mean...

1008
00:54:01,538 --> 00:54:04,336
...when being normal
could save your life...

1009
00:54:04,407 --> 00:54:07,001
...you think you'd give it
a strong second look.

1010
00:54:07,077 --> 00:54:09,011
What's normal Dad?

1011
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:12,515
You with your pint
of Scotch every night?

1012
00:54:12,582 --> 00:54:14,675
That stack of big-boobed
girly magazines...

1013
00:54:14,751 --> 00:54:16,013
...you got hid in the safe
that Mom thinks...

1014
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:18,384
...is just for
your stamp collection?

1015
00:54:18,455 --> 00:54:19,649
That normal?

1016
00:54:24,227 --> 00:54:27,162
Yeah, that's in the ballpark.

1017
00:54:46,149 --> 00:54:48,242
I returned to New York
that winter so lonely...

1018
00:54:48,318 --> 00:54:50,513
...that I was ready to try anything.

1019
00:54:50,587 --> 00:54:53,579
Even getting myself picked
up at one of those bars.

1020
00:54:53,657 --> 00:54:56,558
And it worked,
I got taken home by a guy...

1021
00:54:56,626 --> 00:54:58,491
...whose name I
never did learn so...

1022
00:54:58,561 --> 00:55:01,587
...let's just call him 'psycho'.

1023
00:55:10,707 --> 00:55:13,175
Nope.
This isn't gonna do it.

1024
00:55:13,243 --> 00:55:18,442
I'm really sorry, this just
isn't me, this whole scene.

1025
00:55:18,515 --> 00:55:21,609
I just thought I could drink
my way into it, but I can't...

1026
00:55:21,685 --> 00:55:24,153
...so I'm just gonna
call it a night, OK.

1027
00:55:26,489 --> 00:55:28,184
Hut.

1028
00:55:28,258 --> 00:55:32,558
18, 24, 36... Hut.

1029
00:55:32,629 --> 00:55:33,653
<i>Hut. Hut.</i>

1030
00:55:34,864 --> 00:55:37,799
18, 18.

1031
00:55:37,867 --> 00:55:39,061
Uuhh!

1032
00:55:52,282 --> 00:55:53,943
Yeah.
I'll call you some time.

1033
00:56:12,068 --> 00:56:14,366
I was so stupid.

1034
00:56:14,437 --> 00:56:17,338
I still didn't realize how
big a trouble I was in.

1035
00:56:17,407 --> 00:56:20,865
I still thought I was just
dealing with some drunken jerk.

1036
00:56:20,944 --> 00:56:25,608
When actually I had stumbled
on to something far worse.

1037
00:56:25,682 --> 00:56:27,445
It was unreal.

1038
00:56:27,517 --> 00:56:32,113
I couldn't breathe... And
it wasn't long before...

1039
00:56:32,188 --> 00:56:36,124
I started to lose it, and
I was pretty much screwed.

1040
00:56:38,495 --> 00:56:42,226
Until my mind coughed
up this obscure memory.

1041
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:57,869
Shit!<

1042
00:56:57,947 --> 00:56:59,505
You broke my nose!

1043
00:56:59,582 --> 00:57:00,549
Ah!

1044
00:57:00,617 --> 00:57:01,481
You're dead!

1045
00:57:01,985 --> 00:57:03,077
So dead!

1046
00:57:12,462 --> 00:57:16,523
I ended up in four days in St.
Vincent's for a serious concussion.

1047
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:18,260
It was so ironic.

1048
00:57:18,334 --> 00:57:20,461
Nicky had been playing
football since he was nine...

1049
00:57:20,537 --> 00:57:22,562
...and had never
gotten a concussion.

1050
00:57:22,639 --> 00:57:26,097
I was going for a liberal arts
degree and already had two.

1051
00:57:26,176 --> 00:57:28,804
So after this
muscle-man incident...

1052
00:57:28,878 --> 00:57:32,041
I declared my preference
a- Sexual and hit the books.

1053
00:57:32,115 --> 00:57:35,107
Over the next few years I
became a high honors student...

1054
00:57:35,185 --> 00:57:38,552
VP of my class and a bit
of a soap box activist.

1055
00:57:38,621 --> 00:57:40,885
Meanwhile, Nicky
went to Syracuse...

1056
00:57:40,957 --> 00:57:43,391
...and through his letters I got
the impression that things...

1057
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:46,486
...weren't going as easily
as he was used to.

1058
00:57:46,563 --> 00:57:48,394
It was the first time that
the angels had turned their...

1059
00:57:48,465 --> 00:57:51,662
...backs on my brother
and towards me.

1060
00:57:52,368 --> 00:57:53,665
I've been to the zoo.

1061
00:57:55,905 --> 00:57:59,568
- I'm sorry?
- I said, I've been to the zoo.

1062
00:57:59,642 --> 00:58:02,440
Zoo story, Edward Alby.
Very good.

1063
00:58:02,512 --> 00:58:04,412
Now I know I'm not
wasting my time.

1064
00:58:04,481 --> 00:58:05,948
What are you,
a playwright?

1065
00:58:06,015 --> 00:58:07,983
No, a law student.
You?

1066
00:58:08,051 --> 00:58:10,417
Undergrad.
NYU.

1067
00:58:10,487 --> 00:58:11,920
Is he the genius
they say he is?

1068
00:58:11,988 --> 00:58:13,148
- You haven't read him?
- No.

1069
00:58:13,223 --> 00:58:15,384
Well, maybe I'm
wasting my time.

1070
00:58:17,894 --> 00:58:20,124
The fairy tale
finally happened.

1071
00:58:20,196 --> 00:58:24,155
Lonely prince Dorian
finally met his other prince...

1072
00:58:24,234 --> 00:58:27,692
...and the love prince Dorian felt
for prince Ben cast out...

1073
00:58:27,770 --> 00:58:30,000
...all Dorian's spells
of depression...

1074
00:58:30,073 --> 00:58:34,669
...and gave him the strength of
ten gay men... Or seven straight.

1075
00:58:44,854 --> 00:58:47,322
Ben, you gotta come with us
to keg night at Jessie's Barn.

1076
00:58:47,390 --> 00:58:48,618
We're there.
- Right?

1077
00:58:48,691 --> 00:58:49,988
- Absolutely.
- Great.

1078
00:58:50,059 --> 00:58:50,718
Andrew?

1079
00:58:50,793 --> 00:58:52,954
Let's see, music and beer
with friends or stay home...

1080
00:58:53,029 --> 00:58:55,361
...and have imaginary fights
with my step mother?

1081
00:58:55,431 --> 00:58:56,591
Let me see...

1082
00:58:56,666 --> 00:58:58,657
Oh no, wait we can't Friday.

1083
00:58:58,735 --> 00:59:00,327
- Why not?
- I meant to tell you.

1084
00:59:00,403 --> 00:59:01,836
My parents are coming to town
on Friday and they want...

1085
00:59:01,905 --> 00:59:02,837
..to take us to dinner.

1086
00:59:02,906 --> 00:59:04,464
What?
I'm meeting your parents?

1087
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:06,941
Well, I told them I was bringing
a friend along, you know.

1088
00:59:07,010 --> 00:59:09,740
Just the thought of meeting
Ben's parents sent me...

1089
00:59:09,812 --> 00:59:11,439
...into my newest afflictionl...

1090
00:59:11,514 --> 00:59:13,004
...hyperventilation.

1091
00:59:13,082 --> 00:59:15,516
I'd never met anyone's
parents before.

1092
00:59:15,585 --> 00:59:17,678
Literally, the only
parents I'd met were my own...

1093
00:59:17,754 --> 00:59:19,517
..and that didn't go very well.

1094
00:59:19,589 --> 00:59:21,523
I was terrified
they'd suspect.

1095
00:59:21,591 --> 00:59:22,717
Suspect what?

1096
00:59:22,792 --> 00:59:24,225
That we're more
than just friends.

1097
00:59:24,294 --> 00:59:26,455
Doesn't your brother
introduce his guy buddies...

1098
00:59:26,529 --> 00:59:27,996
...to your parents all the time?

1099
00:59:28,064 --> 00:59:29,531
- Yeah.
- Same thing.

1100
00:59:29,599 --> 00:59:30,327
You think?

1101
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:31,799
Sure, they won't
suspect a thing.

1102
00:59:31,868 --> 00:59:34,632
U nless, of course, you do
something to tip them off.

1103
00:59:35,638 --> 00:59:37,367
I'm kidding.
Just kidding.

1104
00:59:49,953 --> 00:59:53,047
So Dorian, how's your steak?

1105
00:59:53,122 --> 00:59:53,884
It's awesome.

1106
00:59:55,058 --> 00:59:56,184
It's awesome.

1107
01:00:02,432 --> 01:00:04,263
So how long have
you two been lovers?

1108
01:00:08,838 --> 01:00:10,897
- Relax. They already know.
- What?

1109
01:00:10,974 --> 01:00:11,963
- We know!
- We know!

1110
01:00:13,476 --> 01:00:15,307
They're super-liberal,
they don't care.

1111
01:00:15,378 --> 01:00:17,141
- We don't care!
- We don't care!

1112
01:00:17,213 --> 01:00:19,443
Dorian's parents are creepy
ultra-conservatives, so...

1113
01:00:19,515 --> 01:00:21,506
This is kind of
creepy, too, actually.

1114
01:00:26,389 --> 01:00:28,254
I couldn't believe my life.

1115
01:00:28,324 --> 01:00:30,087
I had met my soul mate.

1116
01:00:30,159 --> 01:00:33,686
And his parents, though odd,
were completely accepting.

1117
01:00:34,497 --> 01:00:37,193
And then, just as
quickly, Ben left

1118
01:00:38,701 --> 01:00:41,898
Never gave a good reason,
just said he was tired of us.

1119
01:00:41,971 --> 01:00:43,563
We'd been together two months.

1120
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:46,234
I can't get tired of a
gold fish in two months.

1121
01:00:46,309 --> 01:00:47,674
And I obsessed.

1122
01:00:50,046 --> 01:00:53,675
- This has to stop.
- It is stopping, I promise.

1123
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:56,446
I just need to ask
you one question.

1124
01:00:56,519 --> 01:00:58,612
Why did you break up with me?

1125
01:00:58,688 --> 01:01:00,622
Because I didn't want
to be with you any more.

1126
01:01:00,690 --> 01:01:03,352
Could you be more specific,
I'm trying to grow from this.

1127
01:01:03,426 --> 01:01:06,190
I don't know Dorian, it
just didn't take off.

1128
01:01:06,262 --> 01:01:09,561
I don't know, I'm not
an expert in love.

1129
01:01:09,632 --> 01:01:12,192
I don't analyze
everything like you do...

1130
01:01:12,268 --> 01:01:17,968
...and I don't want to hurt you,
but really, know it, it's over.

1131
01:01:18,041 --> 01:01:19,770
I'm never gonna change
my mind on that.

1132
01:01:19,842 --> 01:01:23,710
It's done, we're done.
H istory, over, finished.

1133
01:01:23,780 --> 01:01:25,714
Did you need more time
to think about this?

1134
01:01:25,782 --> 01:01:26,908
Jesus.

1135
01:01:26,983 --> 01:01:29,281
Just know that I am here
if you ever need to talk...

1136
01:01:30,987 --> 01:01:32,716
...or not.

1137
01:01:32,789 --> 01:01:35,087
Your call, no pressure.

1138
01:01:36,426 --> 01:01:40,419
It was really over,
and I couldn't deal.

1139
01:01:40,496 --> 01:01:44,694
I started walking the
streets, began to drink...

1140
01:01:44,767 --> 01:01:47,327
...the depression I'd always
lived with went clinical...

1141
01:01:47,403 --> 01:01:50,429
...til all I saw in this
city were the seams.

1142
01:01:50,506 --> 01:01:54,237
In fact, I became
a seam myself.

1143
01:01:54,310 --> 01:01:57,279
I clung to the hope Ben's
fear of being alone...

1144
01:01:57,346 --> 01:01:59,871
...would drive him back
to me by default.

1145
01:01:59,949 --> 01:02:03,043
But even that was shattered
when Elle got some inside info.

1146
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:05,986
Ben is not alone he's
with someone else.

1147
01:02:06,923 --> 01:02:07,787
What?

1148
01:02:07,857 --> 01:02:11,020
I just wanted to crawl into
bed for the entire weekend.

1149
01:02:11,094 --> 01:02:13,392
But the gods were not
through with me yet.

1150
01:02:13,463 --> 01:02:16,762
- Ben your brother's a piss.
- What do you mean?

1151
01:02:16,833 --> 01:02:20,098
Oh, man, he's funny as hell.
Hey, I had to let him in.

1152
01:02:20,169 --> 01:02:21,932
I didn't want him sitting
out in the hall with his bag.

1153
01:02:22,004 --> 01:02:23,665
Wait.
What day is this?

1154
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:25,037
Friday, the 21 st.

1155
01:02:25,108 --> 01:02:29,602
No, no, no.
No, no, no.

1156
01:02:31,247 --> 01:02:33,977
I can't do this.
I can't have him here now.

1157
01:02:34,050 --> 01:02:36,018
Just drink some coffee.
You'll be fine.

1158
01:02:45,762 --> 01:02:48,856
Hey Dor!
What a city.

1159
01:02:48,931 --> 01:02:50,956
Man, I can't believe how
tall those buildings are.

1160
01:02:51,033 --> 01:02:53,524
They're so freakin tall.
Whew!

1161
01:02:54,670 --> 01:02:57,036
You know, I don't feel much
like going to a movie tonight.

1162
01:02:57,106 --> 01:02:58,334
What do you want
to do instead?

1163
01:02:58,407 --> 01:02:59,874
Go out.
- That's cool.

1164
01:02:59,942 --> 01:03:02,172
One of my bars, OK?

1165
01:03:02,245 --> 01:03:04,679
You mean like, to a gay bar?
- Yeah.

1166
01:03:04,747 --> 01:03:05,679
- No.
- Why not?

1167
01:03:05,748 --> 01:03:07,272
I'm not going to
a gay bar, Dorian.

1168
01:03:07,350 --> 01:03:09,375
Come on, you said you
came to see my life.

1169
01:03:09,452 --> 01:03:12,444
Not your gay life, I meant like
the school cafeteria and shit.

1170
01:03:12,522 --> 01:03:13,750
Why do you do that?

1171
01:03:13,823 --> 01:03:15,620
Why do you call
it "my gay life"?

1172
01:03:15,691 --> 01:03:18,125
This is my life and this is
what I do on the weekend...

1173
01:03:18,194 --> 01:03:19,286
I go to a gay bar.

1174
01:03:19,362 --> 01:03:22,058
And this is my favorite
one, it's a wonderful place...

1175
01:03:22,131 --> 01:03:22,927
...great people.

1176
01:03:22,999 --> 01:03:24,967
I don't care if it's
the Tajma-freakin-hall...

1177
01:03:25,034 --> 01:03:26,729
I didn't drive six hours to
come and see you just to...

1178
01:03:26,803 --> 01:03:30,239
Oh Jesus. Please,
I'm not feeling well...

1179
01:03:30,306 --> 01:03:32,399
...and I really need to
be with some friends.

1180
01:03:32,475 --> 01:03:34,909
And Ellie's gonna be there.
- Ellie?

1181
01:03:34,977 --> 01:03:37,673
Yeah, my friend Ellie
that I wrote you about.

1182
01:03:37,747 --> 01:03:39,942
So there are
girls at this bar.

1183
01:03:40,016 --> 01:03:41,916
Lesbian girls, Nick.

1184
01:03:41,984 --> 01:03:43,815
- Forget it then.
- Unbelieveable.

1185
01:03:48,724 --> 01:03:50,453
Hey Nick.

1186
01:03:50,526 --> 01:03:53,495
You know what they
got there at this bar?

1187
01:03:53,563 --> 01:03:56,930
That football throwing game.
- What throwing game?

1188
01:03:56,999 --> 01:03:58,398
The one where you
throw the footballs...

1189
01:03:58,467 --> 01:04:00,526
...at the moving targets for points.

1190
01:04:00,603 --> 01:04:01,934
Quarterback Red
Zone Challenge?

1191
01:04:02,004 --> 01:04:04,234
That's it.
- They got that at a gay bar?

1192
01:04:04,307 --> 01:04:06,070
- Are you any good at it?
- Shut up.

1193
01:04:06,142 --> 01:04:08,576
Because some of these
guys are excellent.

1194
01:04:08,644 --> 01:04:10,612
You mean, some
of the gay guys.

1195
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:12,773
- They play for money.
- Money?

1196
01:04:12,849 --> 01:04:15,147
But really,
they're very good.

1197
01:04:15,218 --> 01:04:18,619
Oh I'm sure.
Oh yeah, scored another one.

1198
01:04:18,688 --> 01:04:19,347
Get ready.

1199
01:04:19,856 --> 01:04:24,225
And my, your so pretty for
a girl that looks so angry, 

1200
01:04:24,293 --> 01:04:28,593
and I am such a pretty
little girl, tell me... 

1201
01:04:28,664 --> 01:04:32,725
do I make you uncomfortable? 

1202
01:04:32,802 --> 01:04:36,898
Do I make you uncomfortable? 

1203
01:04:36,973 --> 01:04:40,409
Do I make you I make
you uncomfortable? 

1204
01:04:40,476 --> 01:04:42,876
Well, I'm tryin. 

1205
01:04:43,846 --> 01:04:44,608
Thanks.

1206
01:04:50,353 --> 01:04:53,049
What's the matter Nick?
Did they score more than you?

1207
01:04:53,122 --> 01:04:54,646
- Shut up.
- Hey boys!

1208
01:04:54,724 --> 01:04:57,818
Hey Ellie's here.
Nicky this is Ellie.

1209
01:04:57,894 --> 01:04:59,657
Hey, Nick.
I've heard a lot about you.

1210
01:04:59,729 --> 01:05:01,196
I've heard a lot
about you too.

1211
01:05:01,264 --> 01:05:03,027
Oh, what?
Are you going to sulk now?

1212
01:05:03,099 --> 01:05:03,963
Then here, go get us drinks.

1213
01:05:04,033 --> 01:05:06,001
Elle takes anything
dark in a bottle.

1214
01:05:06,068 --> 01:05:09,128
Me, kill the club soda,
I'll take a non-alcoholic.

1215
01:05:11,073 --> 01:05:12,597
- He's adorable.
- Yeah.

1216
01:05:12,675 --> 01:05:16,805
- So how you doing after today?
- Surprisingly all right.

1217
01:05:16,879 --> 01:05:18,471
Listen, I gotta talk
to you about something.

1218
01:05:18,547 --> 01:05:20,811
Yeah, OK, but listen I want
you to do a favor...

1219
01:05:20,883 --> 01:05:22,009
...for me tonight, OK?

1220
01:05:22,084 --> 01:05:23,915
I want you to help me to
show my hot shot brother...

1221
01:05:23,986 --> 01:05:25,044
...how popular I am.

1222
01:05:25,121 --> 01:05:26,349
- Popular?
- Yeah.

1223
01:05:26,422 --> 01:05:28,185
- Yeah, I'm popular.
- Yes, you are.

1224
01:05:28,257 --> 01:05:29,622
And he's never seen
that, you know...

1225
01:05:29,692 --> 01:05:30,989
...so I want you to keep
your eyes peeled out...

1226
01:05:31,060 --> 01:05:33,358
...for anybody we know, call
them over, whoop it up...

1227
01:05:33,429 --> 01:05:35,590
...and help me show N icky that
I'm hot shit down here.

1228
01:05:35,665 --> 01:05:36,996
I will do that but I've
got to talk to you...

1229
01:05:37,066 --> 01:05:38,055
...about something else first.

1230
01:05:38,134 --> 01:05:39,726
Something I was trying to
tell you earlier at the pub.

1231
01:05:39,802 --> 01:05:41,292
Is this about your
Psych professor?

1232
01:05:41,370 --> 01:05:42,302
No.

1233
01:05:44,740 --> 01:05:46,207
Here you go Ellie.
- Thanks.

1234
01:05:46,275 --> 01:05:48,334
What do you say, one more
drink and they're out of here?

1235
01:05:48,411 --> 01:05:49,844
What?
We just got here.

1236
01:05:49,912 --> 01:05:52,608
And you've been playing that
game and Elle just got here.

1237
01:05:52,682 --> 01:05:54,547
Come on, Dor, I came
down to see the city.

1238
01:05:54,617 --> 01:05:56,448
We've got a whole
weekend to see the city.

1239
01:05:56,519 --> 01:05:58,248
Tonight I just wanted
us to hang out.

1240
01:05:58,321 --> 01:06:00,016
It's no fun for me
hanging out here.

1241
01:06:00,089 --> 01:06:01,021
Oh give it a chance,
will you?

1242
01:06:01,090 --> 01:06:03,581
Think it was all fun for me
visiting you at Syracuse...

1243
01:06:03,659 --> 01:06:05,889
...sitting through three
hours of football practice?

1244
01:06:05,962 --> 01:06:08,692
It wasn't all bad, you got to
go in the locker room after.

1245
01:06:09,999 --> 01:06:14,026
Look, I know you feel awkward
not knowing anybody here.

1246
01:06:14,103 --> 01:06:14,933
You know.

1247
01:06:15,004 --> 01:06:17,063
You're not used to that,
the great N ick Legatis.

1248
01:06:17,139 --> 01:06:18,003
No, I'm not.

1249
01:06:18,074 --> 01:06:20,736
But I know people here
and this is my turf...

1250
01:06:20,810 --> 01:06:22,471
...and if your with me then
we're gonna have fun.

1251
01:06:22,545 --> 01:06:23,842
Nicholas Legatis.

1252
01:06:23,913 --> 01:06:25,312
Oh man, this is
unbelieveable.

1253
01:06:25,381 --> 01:06:27,144
The great Nick Legatis.

1254
01:06:27,216 --> 01:06:29,116
Hey, Buffer Jones.

1255
01:06:29,185 --> 01:06:32,177
Man, I haven't seen you
since QB camp in Pittsburgh.

1256
01:06:32,254 --> 01:06:35,815
Hey, this is my brother,
Dorian and his friend, Ellie.

1257
01:06:35,891 --> 01:06:36,619
H i, how you doing?

1258
01:06:36,692 --> 01:06:38,159
Buffer Jones,
plays for L state.

1259
01:06:38,227 --> 01:06:40,752
Rugger, we got another
Division 1 here.

1260
01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:42,229
Penn State.
- What's up, man.

1261
01:06:42,298 --> 01:06:44,357
- Hey, come and have a beer with us.
- Sure.

1262
01:06:48,371 --> 01:06:50,134
Can you believe this, I can't
even make a bigger splash...

1263
01:06:50,206 --> 01:06:52,197
...than him in my own
neighborhood gay bar.

1264
01:06:52,274 --> 01:06:54,936
It's just as well,
listen, Ben's here.

1265
01:06:55,011 --> 01:06:58,037
What, my Ben?
No, he doesn't come here.

1266
01:06:58,114 --> 01:07:00,173
Yeah, well, his new partner
does and they're both here...

1267
01:07:00,249 --> 01:07:01,546
...and they both want
to talk to you.

1268
01:07:01,617 --> 01:07:02,447
What, but... what?

1269
01:07:02,518 --> 01:07:04,281
Listen, I was supposed to get
you up to speed on the whole thing...

1270
01:07:04,353 --> 01:07:05,650
...but I couldn't
get it out earlier...

1271
01:07:05,721 --> 01:07:07,120
- You were so hurt.
- What whole thing?

1272
01:07:07,189 --> 01:07:09,123
On what's been going on.
- And what is going on?

1273
01:07:09,191 --> 01:07:10,089
Hello, Dorian.

1274
01:07:14,196 --> 01:07:14,924
Dorian.

1275
01:07:21,370 --> 01:07:21,995
No.

1276
01:07:23,672 --> 01:07:24,468
No way.

1277
01:07:24,540 --> 01:07:25,666
You didn't tell him, did you?

1278
01:07:25,741 --> 01:07:30,269
Almost, listen honey,
I'm so sorry I swear to God...

1279
01:07:30,346 --> 01:07:31,836
I was trying to tell you earlier.

1280
01:07:31,914 --> 01:07:34,280
You don't have to do this but
whenever you're ready...

1281
01:07:34,350 --> 01:07:37,046
...with me and Ben and Andrew,
we all love you.

1282
01:07:37,119 --> 01:07:40,418
No, no that's great,
and let's do it now.

1283
01:07:40,489 --> 01:07:42,514
- Are you sure?
- Positive.

1284
01:07:42,591 --> 01:07:45,151
Really, Elle, it's cool.

1285
01:07:51,033 --> 01:07:52,466
First of all,
I'd like to say that I...

1286
01:07:52,535 --> 01:07:54,002
No, first of all...

1287
01:07:54,070 --> 01:07:55,970
...whatever this is,
you're not running it.

1288
01:07:56,038 --> 01:07:56,732
Drew.

1289
01:07:57,506 --> 01:08:00,134
We just weren't right
for each other, Dor.

1290
01:08:02,011 --> 01:08:04,536
And hey, I honestly
think you're better off.

1291
01:08:04,613 --> 01:08:05,705
Seriously.

1292
01:08:05,781 --> 01:08:07,612
I mean I'd bore you after
awhile, you know I would.

1293
01:08:07,683 --> 01:08:11,175
I'm just not... intellectually
curious like you are.

1294
01:08:11,253 --> 01:08:14,222
All I want out of life is to work
for my father's firm and play.

1295
01:08:14,290 --> 01:08:17,521
And you want to, you know...
better yourself.

1296
01:08:18,761 --> 01:08:20,023
And Andrew's more like me.

1297
01:08:20,096 --> 01:08:21,324
You don't want to
better yourself?

1298
01:08:21,397 --> 01:08:22,659
I really don't.

1299
01:08:22,731 --> 01:08:24,255
So you're saying is that
I'm better off alone.

1300
01:08:24,333 --> 01:08:26,164
No, with someone else.

1301
01:08:26,235 --> 01:08:26,997
Who else?

1302
01:08:27,069 --> 01:08:28,559
It took me 22
years to find you.

1303
01:08:28,637 --> 01:08:29,695
I think what Ben's
trying to say is...

1304
01:08:29,772 --> 01:08:32,366
- Andrew, please, I'm upset.
- So am I.

1305
01:08:32,441 --> 01:08:35,001
You're upset, what do you
got to be upset about?

1306
01:08:35,077 --> 01:08:37,568
You won.
You won the prize.

1307
01:08:37,646 --> 01:08:40,274
An intellectually uncurious
prize but a prize just the same.

1308
01:08:40,349 --> 01:08:42,749
You know, maybe right there is one
of the reason's why he left you...

1309
01:08:42,818 --> 01:08:43,842
...you always have a dig.

1310
01:08:43,919 --> 01:08:45,386
- Andrew.
- It's true, Elle.

1311
01:08:46,122 --> 01:08:47,350
Is that the truth?

1312
01:08:47,423 --> 01:08:49,015
Well people do
annoy you, Dor.

1313
01:08:49,091 --> 01:08:50,718
They don't bother me.

1314
01:08:50,793 --> 01:08:52,954
You know, I'm low key,
you're kind of high strung.

1315
01:08:53,028 --> 01:08:54,325
You have to admit,
Dorian, that...

1316
01:08:54,396 --> 01:08:55,522
No, no, no, no.

1317
01:08:55,598 --> 01:08:59,398
I don't have to admit a damn
thing... Not to you, Andrew.

1318
01:08:59,468 --> 01:09:01,834
Did you two really
come down here to say;

1319
01:09:01,904 --> 01:09:03,496
"Sorry you're alone
but here's some tips...

1320
01:09:03,572 --> 01:09:05,870
...on changing your personality
so you don't have to be"?

1321
01:09:05,941 --> 01:09:07,499
Actually the tips
were Ben's idea.

1322
01:09:07,576 --> 01:09:09,407
I just wanted to tell
you why you're alone.

1323
01:09:14,250 --> 01:09:15,444
I think we're done here.

1324
01:09:15,518 --> 01:09:17,281
Ben, please don't go.

1325
01:09:19,955 --> 01:09:20,785
Ahhh!

1326
01:09:22,024 --> 01:09:23,252
You guys, stop it.

1327
01:09:23,993 --> 01:09:25,187
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

1328
01:09:25,628 --> 01:09:27,289
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

1329
01:09:27,630 --> 01:09:28,528
Sorry, sorry, sorry.
- You alright?

1330
01:09:28,597 --> 01:09:30,394
I'm fine.
- What happened?

1331
01:09:30,466 --> 01:09:31,831
Nothing, it's over.

1332
01:09:38,407 --> 01:09:48,112
Circle, circle, here I go
back in this place again. 

1333
01:09:50,386 --> 01:09:59,920
So will you see me fallin' down
or will you just pretend? 

1334
01:10:05,467 --> 01:10:08,095
- What are you so quiet about?
- Nothing, I'm just tired.

1335
01:10:10,339 --> 01:10:12,239
Hey, I thought you were going
to take me to a nice place tonight.

1336
01:10:12,308 --> 01:10:14,708
It is a nice place.
What, you didn't think so?

1337
01:10:14,777 --> 01:10:17,871
No, it's just that usually nice
places don't have bar fights.

1338
01:10:19,615 --> 01:10:20,877
Did you have a good
time tonight, N ick?

1339
01:10:20,950 --> 01:10:24,351
Yeah I sure did, and
seeing Buff was a piss.

1340
01:10:24,420 --> 01:10:26,081
Seeing Buff was a piss.

1341
01:10:26,155 --> 01:10:26,814
Yeah.

1342
01:10:26,889 --> 01:10:28,447
Hey I've got a
question for you.

1343
01:10:28,524 --> 01:10:30,651
Let me ask you this.

1344
01:10:30,726 --> 01:10:35,891
Did you have any idea that this Buff
guy was, you know, that way.

1345
01:10:35,965 --> 01:10:39,765
No, not at all I mean there
was not a clue at quarterback camp.

1346
01:10:39,835 --> 01:10:40,699
I'll tell you that.

1347
01:10:40,769 --> 01:10:42,327
And you didn't tell
him you weren't?

1348
01:10:42,404 --> 01:10:43,564
No, never came up.

1349
01:10:43,639 --> 01:10:45,539
Hmm.
- Huh?

1350
01:10:45,608 --> 01:10:47,769
Nothing its just, why
didn't it come up?

1351
01:10:47,843 --> 01:10:49,401
Just didn't.

1352
01:10:49,478 --> 01:10:52,504
I know, but why didn't you
make a point of bringing it up?

1353
01:10:52,581 --> 01:10:57,075
Oh, well, I guess I kinda just
steered clear of the whole subject.

1354
01:10:57,152 --> 01:10:59,950
Huh that's curious.
- Why is that curious?

1355
01:11:00,022 --> 01:11:02,252
I don't know, I just find it
curious that you would...

1356
01:11:02,324 --> 01:11:04,884
...go a whole night without
dropping a girfriend's name or...

1357
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:08,361
...you know, finding some way
to disclose your preference.

1358
01:11:08,430 --> 01:11:10,796
I don't think in terms of
disclosing my preference.

1359
01:11:10,866 --> 01:11:13,733
Well, when you're not gay in
a gay bar you should because...

1360
01:11:13,802 --> 01:11:16,771
...this Buffer guy was
definitely flirting with you.

1361
01:11:16,839 --> 01:11:19,569
- He was not.
- Oh, yes he was.

1362
01:11:19,642 --> 01:11:20,836
Bull shit.

1363
01:11:20,909 --> 01:11:22,774
What do you think that laughing
and leaning into you was...

1364
01:11:22,845 --> 01:11:25,507
...all the hands
on your sholder.

1365
01:11:25,581 --> 01:11:27,344
That's just how football
players are with each other.

1366
01:11:27,416 --> 01:11:28,747
Well, that's another
whole discussion...

1367
01:11:28,817 --> 01:11:29,749
...but I'm not
getting into that.

1368
01:11:29,818 --> 01:11:32,412
Besides, even if he
was, who cares, I mean...

1369
01:11:32,488 --> 01:11:34,251
...if the guy was flirting with
me and I didn't notice...

1370
01:11:34,323 --> 01:11:35,813
...then who gives a shit?

1371
01:11:35,891 --> 01:11:37,984
OK, don't get so defensive.

1372
01:11:40,129 --> 01:11:42,427
What's the matter N icky, did
you feel something for the guy?

1373
01:11:46,502 --> 01:11:48,470
What did you just ask me?

1374
01:11:48,537 --> 01:11:50,971
If you felt something and
that's why you didn't...

1375
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:54,532
...drop girls names and come off.

1376
01:11:54,610 --> 01:11:56,407
I had a few beers
with the guy.

1377
01:11:56,478 --> 01:11:58,742
What the hell are
you talking about?

1378
01:11:58,814 --> 01:11:59,838
I'm just asking.

1379
01:11:59,915 --> 01:12:03,544
Really, you really think
you need to ask me that?

1380
01:12:03,619 --> 01:12:04,916
Apparently I don't.

1381
01:12:07,723 --> 01:12:10,453
What, you trying to
turn me gay, Dor.

1382
01:12:10,526 --> 01:12:13,586
Is that why me
took me to... Huh?

1383
01:12:13,662 --> 01:12:15,721
Because you're the
family faggot, not me.

1384
01:12:20,469 --> 01:12:25,270
You're getting really warped,
asshole, really warped.

1385
01:12:27,810 --> 01:12:30,574
He was insulted,
and I was glad.

1386
01:12:30,646 --> 01:12:33,513
I wanted to insult him,
anything to punch some holes...

1387
01:12:33,582 --> 01:12:35,447
...in his perfect life.

1388
01:12:35,517 --> 01:12:38,850
But he's impervious to
real pain, or so I thought.

1389
01:12:38,921 --> 01:12:42,152
He returned an hour later,
and sometime in the night...

1390
01:12:42,224 --> 01:12:46,422
I awoke to a sound I hadn't
heard since I was ten years old..

1391
01:12:46,495 --> 01:12:49,487
...the sound of
my brother, crying.

1392
01:12:51,300 --> 01:12:52,130
Nicky?

1393
01:12:55,471 --> 01:12:56,768
N cky, what is it?

1394
01:13:03,812 --> 01:13:05,006
Nicky, what's wrong.

1395
01:13:10,886 --> 01:13:12,683
Oh my God, did
you like that guy?

1396
01:13:12,755 --> 01:13:13,813
What?

1397
01:13:13,889 --> 01:13:15,857
I was only half
serious, but, man...

1398
01:13:15,924 --> 01:13:17,789
I did not like
that guy, Dorian.

1399
01:13:17,860 --> 01:13:19,725
Jesus Christ, there's a lot
more in life to cry about...

1400
01:13:19,795 --> 01:13:20,819
...than being gay.

1401
01:13:20,896 --> 01:13:21,920
I'm not crying about...

1402
01:13:21,997 --> 01:13:23,658
It's something
completely different.

1403
01:13:23,732 --> 01:13:25,359
All right, fine, what is it?

1404
01:13:26,468 --> 01:13:28,595
- It's none of your business.
- What do you mean it's...

1405
01:13:28,670 --> 01:13:30,137
I mean, it's none
of your business.

1406
01:13:30,205 --> 01:13:30,933
Why is it none of my...

1407
01:13:31,006 --> 01:13:33,133
- It just isn't.
- Come on, we're brothers.

1408
01:13:33,208 --> 01:13:35,574
Oh, yeah, we're brothers when
you wanna know something.

1409
01:13:37,746 --> 01:13:39,236
Look, I just had a
really rough week...

1410
01:13:39,314 --> 01:13:41,077
...and it's backing up
on me, all right?

1411
01:13:41,150 --> 01:13:43,345
My God, what's happened
this is not like you...

1412
01:13:43,419 --> 01:13:45,080
...things don't back up on you.

1413
01:13:45,154 --> 01:13:46,985
I don't want to
talk about it.

1414
01:13:47,055 --> 01:13:48,920
Don't tell me you don't
want to talk about it.

1415
01:13:48,991 --> 01:13:51,186
Just leave it alone will you?
- I will not leave it alone.

1416
01:13:51,260 --> 01:13:52,249
Christ, you're
worse than a woman.

1417
01:13:52,327 --> 01:13:55,023
Hey, Nicky, I wake up and
find you more upset...

1418
01:13:55,097 --> 01:13:57,895
...than I've ever seen you in my life
and you expect me to blow it off.

1419
01:13:57,966 --> 01:13:59,866
I lost my scholarship.
All right?

1420
01:14:01,737 --> 01:14:02,601
What?

1421
01:14:03,372 --> 01:14:04,771
They took my scholarship.

1422
01:14:07,810 --> 01:14:09,243
Your football scholarship?

1423
01:14:09,311 --> 01:14:11,779
No, my Rhodes scholarship,
how many scholarships do I have?

1424
01:14:11,847 --> 01:14:13,246
What happened?

1425
01:14:14,283 --> 01:14:15,375
They cut me.

1426
01:14:16,652 --> 01:14:18,517
Wednesday.

1427
01:14:18,587 --> 01:14:20,350
It's all over, Dor.

1428
01:14:22,124 --> 01:14:23,250
I didn't make it.

1429
01:14:24,626 --> 01:14:26,856
- I didn't have it.
- My God.

1430
01:14:28,163 --> 01:14:30,393
What do you do now?

1431
01:14:30,466 --> 01:14:33,867
What every other schmuck
does, pay tuition.

1432
01:14:33,936 --> 01:14:35,870
Did you tell Mom and Dad yet?

1433
01:14:35,938 --> 01:14:37,929
Mm-hmm.
- You did, when?

1434
01:14:38,006 --> 01:14:39,633
- Wednesday.
- What did they say?

1435
01:14:39,708 --> 01:14:42,142
I told Mom first.

1436
01:14:42,211 --> 01:14:46,079
She said now you can
concentrate on becoming a lawyer.

1437
01:14:46,148 --> 01:14:50,175
Then Dad grabs the phone and
says "What's going on, N ick?"

1438
01:14:50,252 --> 01:14:55,019
And I tell him and he says
"Well that's that, then. "

1439
01:14:55,090 --> 01:14:56,557
And he hands the
phone back to mom.

1440
01:14:56,625 --> 01:14:58,957
Oh, man, what a prick.

1441
01:14:59,027 --> 01:15:01,257
Well it was a huge
disappointment for him, Dorian.

1442
01:15:01,330 --> 01:15:03,161
For him?
For him?

1443
01:15:03,232 --> 01:15:04,358
It meant a lot to him.

1444
01:15:04,433 --> 01:15:06,264
Then why didn't he
become a football player?

1445
01:15:06,335 --> 01:15:08,963
Oh, because he wasn't good
enough, there's a real twist.

1446
01:15:09,037 --> 01:15:09,901
Can he vent?

1447
01:15:09,972 --> 01:15:14,409
No, God, he should be consoling
you and you defend him.

1448
01:15:14,476 --> 01:15:16,376
You know, something,
you're too hard on people.

1449
01:15:16,445 --> 01:15:19,346
You know, Mom said he was up
all night after I told him...

1450
01:15:19,414 --> 01:15:20,312
...sick as a dog.

1451
01:15:20,382 --> 01:15:22,748
I'm sure he was, because
he's got his ego...

1452
01:15:22,818 --> 01:15:24,080
...all wrapped up in yours.

1453
01:15:24,152 --> 01:15:26,086
- Man, it's demented.
- Man, I shouldn't have told you.

1454
01:15:26,622 --> 01:15:29,284
News flash, Dad is fucked up.

1455
01:15:29,358 --> 01:15:30,848
So are you, and I give
you breaks all the time.

1456
01:15:30,926 --> 01:15:31,858
Oh, you give me breaks?

1457
01:15:31,927 --> 01:15:32,757
What?

1458
01:15:33,595 --> 01:15:35,358
- Hey guys.
- We're being loud, I know.

1459
01:15:35,430 --> 01:15:38,456
No, no, no, it's just Dor, you
got a call on the hall phone.

1460
01:15:39,668 --> 01:15:43,729
- It must be Ellie.
- No, it's an Aunt Beth.

1461
01:15:45,107 --> 01:15:47,598
<i>And that's exactly
how it happened.</i>

1462
01:15:47,676 --> 01:15:49,906
We were just
talking about him.

1463
01:15:49,978 --> 01:15:53,379
His name was literally still
in the air when we found out...

1464
01:15:53,448 --> 01:15:57,748
...he'd a heart
attack and was gone.

1465
01:15:57,819 --> 01:16:01,619
And to be honest, I didn't
know exactly what to feel...

1466
01:16:01,690 --> 01:16:04,523
...but poor Nicky, he knew.

1467
01:16:14,336 --> 01:16:22,971
In a perfect world, I would
have told you what I was thinking. 

1468
01:16:24,079 --> 01:16:26,513
You would have smiled. 

1469
01:16:28,850 --> 01:16:32,308
You would have smiled. 

1470
01:16:36,124 --> 01:16:45,726
In a perfect world, we would have
walked out of this place together, 

1471
01:16:45,801 --> 01:16:48,736
and said goodbye, 

1472
01:16:51,206 --> 01:16:54,073
said good luck. 

1473
01:16:58,847 --> 01:17:05,047
I want to scream,
but I just whisper. 

1474
01:17:09,958 --> 01:17:19,094
In a perfect world, the ones
you love should ease your burden... 

1475
01:17:19,167 --> 01:17:24,332
and make you soar, 

1476
01:17:24,406 --> 01:17:33,974
make you sure,
in a perfect world. 

1477
01:17:50,365 --> 01:17:53,698
They say a boy becomes a
man the day his father dies.

1478
01:17:53,769 --> 01:17:56,203
For me it happened
a few days late.

1479
01:17:56,271 --> 01:17:58,171
I was getting fed up.

1480
01:17:58,240 --> 01:18:00,265
I'd already been through
two nights of wakes...

1481
01:18:00,342 --> 01:18:02,902
...listening to a million people
praise my father like he was...

1482
01:18:02,978 --> 01:18:04,741
Ghandi's better brother.

1483
01:18:04,813 --> 01:18:08,214
And come the morning of the funeral
I'm brooding on the front lawn...

1484
01:18:08,283 --> 01:18:10,513
...half hung over
and seriously considering...

1485
01:18:10,585 --> 01:18:14,521
...not attending the days events,
and I think my mother knew it.

1486
01:18:14,823 --> 01:18:15,847
What are you doing?

1487
01:18:15,924 --> 01:18:18,392
Just trying to get
my head on straight.

1488
01:18:18,460 --> 01:18:19,358
Don't wait up.

1489
01:18:26,034 --> 01:18:27,831
Head on straight about what,
you father?

1490
01:18:31,306 --> 01:18:34,332
He could be a real son
of a bitch, couldn't he?

1491
01:18:34,409 --> 01:18:35,569
Excuse me?

1492
01:18:35,644 --> 01:18:37,669
What, you didn't
think I knew that?

1493
01:18:37,746 --> 01:18:39,270
I didn't think you'd say it.

1494
01:18:39,347 --> 01:18:43,147
Well, he was very
angry... I know.

1495
01:18:44,553 --> 01:18:46,043
Like to talk about
you for a minute.

1496
01:18:46,121 --> 01:18:47,782
You want to talk, Mom?
- Yes.

1497
01:18:47,856 --> 01:18:49,847
- About something?
- Don't.

1498
01:18:49,925 --> 01:18:52,485
All right, what do you
want to talk about?

1499
01:18:52,561 --> 01:18:54,290
About how much you
remind me of him.

1500
01:18:54,362 --> 01:18:56,296
Of who, Dad?
- Yes.

1501
01:18:56,364 --> 01:18:58,855
What is that, some kind
of twisted compliment?

1502
01:18:58,934 --> 01:19:00,765
It's not a compliment at all.

1503
01:19:00,836 --> 01:19:03,202
I'm saying you're
angry too, honey.

1504
01:19:03,271 --> 01:19:05,933
Don't you see how
angry you are?

1505
01:19:06,007 --> 01:19:09,170
I do.
Your Aunt Beth does.

1506
01:19:09,244 --> 01:19:11,542
I don't want that.

1507
01:19:11,613 --> 01:19:14,776
I don't want you to be angry
and hateful toward people.

1508
01:19:14,850 --> 01:19:16,374
I want you to be good.

1509
01:19:19,020 --> 01:19:20,783
Even though your father
wasn't good to you...

1510
01:19:20,856 --> 01:19:23,450
...and your mother didn't have
the nerve to stop him.

1511
01:19:30,165 --> 01:19:35,569
I know, baby... I should
have stopped him.

1512
01:19:53,622 --> 01:19:56,489
Well, that's all
I had to say.

1513
01:19:56,558 --> 01:19:58,583
It was a lot actually.

1514
01:19:58,660 --> 01:20:01,788
<i>It was a lot,
because it was true.</i>

1515
01:20:01,863 --> 01:20:04,798
My father did leave
me pissed off.

1516
01:20:04,866 --> 01:20:06,163
And you know why?

1517
01:20:06,234 --> 01:20:10,000
You know the one worst thing
that my father ever did to me?

1518
01:20:10,071 --> 01:20:14,030
He convinced me it matters
what people think of you...

1519
01:20:14,109 --> 01:20:17,636
...and truth is they never
think quite enough.

1520
01:20:17,712 --> 01:20:19,942
So from then,
I started living my life...

1521
01:20:20,015 --> 01:20:21,846
...no matter what they thought.

1522
01:20:21,917 --> 01:20:23,646
Even when they
thought I was crazy...

1523
01:20:23,718 --> 01:20:26,380
...and should take my liberal views
and my pink shirt...

1524
01:20:26,454 --> 01:20:29,981
...and move to another planet,
I just had to laugh...

1525
01:20:30,058 --> 01:20:33,152
...cause it's not pink, it's fuchsia.
