longing for the truth

72
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:34,470
For all of us who cry out in pain

73
01:03:36,320 --> 01:03:38,436

These pictures were released of the Englishman
eleived to have abducted the son of Cannes Film Festiva
Jury member Emil Dechevsky

76
01:03:55,360 --> 01:03:58,272
A positive Id of the boy was made
at a service station yesterday

77
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:03,359
The police now believe ότι that the man
is travelling with a female accomplice

78
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:07,359
A national manhunt has been launched
and stop and search procedures... across France

79
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:21,317
You are not Russian?

80
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:23,429
No

81
01:04:23,480 --> 01:04:25,391
You are not this boy's father?

82
01:04:28,360 --> 01:04:30,351
- No
- You are English?

83
01:04:31,320 --> 01:04:32,309
Oui

84
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:35,476
You know the whole of France is looking for you

85
01:04:36,360 --> 01:04:37,475
And now they look for me too

86
01:04:38,440 --> 01:04:40,351
Who are you?
Where are you going?

87
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:47,357
To the Beach

88
01:05:29,320 --> 01:05:31,390
This boy's father is
a Judge of the... film

89
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:33,389
We take him there

90
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:38,351
And the beach?

91
01:05:39,320 --> 01:05:40,355
Forget the beach

92
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:42,311
I have only one scene in this movie

93
01:05:42,360 --> 01:05:46,319
And I am not going to miss this Premiere
not for you not for the Police

94
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:49,311
Now do as I say

95
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:20,469
Bonjour Madame

96
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:23,435
Gracias

97
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:27,277
Buenos Dias Senora

98
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:54,435
Come on we find Papa

99
01:09:26,440 --> 01:09:27,509
Stay here

100
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:30,391
Papa

101
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:33,309
Where is his father?

102
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:36,391
A look this is my scene

103
01:10:56,480 --> 01:10:58,391
He cut my scene

104
01:13:05,480 --> 01:13:06,515
It's Mr Carson Clay

105
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:55,391
Where is he?
Where is the projectionist?

106
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:53,275
Stop

107
01:14:54,360 --> 01:14:55,429
He stole my son

108
01:14:56,400 --> 01:14:57,435
No he didn't

109
01:14:59,320 --> 01:15:00,469
Where is my son?
Where is he?

110
01:15:02,480 --> 01:15:04,311
Here

111
01:15:38,440 --> 01:15:41,432
A strange thing happens when you
are making a work of art

112
01:15:42,520 --> 01:15:48,356
Don't quite see the elements come together
and then when it all comes together

113
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:51,438
there is something magical, or something
organic, such a thing happened today

114
01:15:52,320 --> 01:15:53,469
And everyone said this wouldn't work

115
01:15:54,360 --> 01:15:58,512
They said it was a terrible risk but I wanna
keep on making films just like this

116
01:15:59,480 --> 01:16:06,397
The video film combination it's something that's realy
been done before but not quite like this

117
01:16:07,480 --> 01:16:13,350
I am glad the reception was so great
and I am just happy to be here

118
01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:15,476
Vive La France
Bless you

119
01:18:00,320 --> 01:18:04,279
Come and see what I made

120
01:19:10,360 --> 01:19:15,434
THE END
