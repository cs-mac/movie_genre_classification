1
00:00:31,162 --> 00:00:33,974
"Save the Planet".

2
00:00:34,053 --> 00:00:37,739
Whenever I've read that
bumper sticker, I had to lie.

3
00:00:38,941 --> 00:00:42,470
Save The Planet... what for?

4
00:00:42,471 --> 00:00:45,931
And from what?
From ourselves?

5
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:51,198
Life's simple, kill or be killed.

6
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:55,343
Don't get involved
and always finish the job.

7
00:00:55,626 --> 00:00:59,521
A Survivor's code... my code.

8
00:01:00,466 --> 00:01:02,404
It all sounds great...

9
00:01:02,405 --> 00:01:05,708
'till the day you find yourself
confronted with a choice.

10
00:01:05,709 --> 00:01:08,416
A choice to make a difference...

11
00:01:08,417 --> 00:01:12,420
to help someone, or to walk away
and save yourself.

12
00:01:12,853 --> 00:01:17,850
I learned something that day,
you can't always walk away.

13
00:01:19,028 --> 00:01:22,168
Too bad it was the day I died.

14
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:15,569
Get up!

15
00:03:15,753 --> 00:03:17,771
Move it.

16
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:20,115
Get back.

17
00:03:23,423 --> 00:03:25,434
Remember me?

18
00:03:25,435 --> 00:03:28,884
You sold me a gun that don't work,
you almost got me killed...

19
00:03:28,885 --> 00:03:31,656
I paid you $20.00 for it,
I want my money back.

20
00:03:34,602 --> 00:03:36,492
Give me that.

21
00:04:00,046 --> 00:04:02,207
- How much?
- $15.00.

22
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:03,309
How much?

23
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:05,700
- Alright, $12.50.
- Okay.

24
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:10,032
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.

25
00:04:15,401 --> 00:04:17,203
Toorope?

26
00:04:18,626 --> 00:04:20,108
I'll owe you.

27
00:04:20,116 --> 00:04:22,979
- Toorope, are you leaving?
- I'll see you soon.

28
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:24,981
Okay, see you.

29
00:04:39,889 --> 00:04:43,820
Hey, Toorope! Toorope, somebody
came by looking for you.

30
00:04:44,307 --> 00:04:46,211
Real good.

31
00:05:00,935 --> 00:05:03,217
<i>... what a massacre!</i>

32
00:05:08,844 --> 00:05:12,451
...at the peak of the rush hour,
bombs were detonated in...

33
00:05:46,391 --> 00:05:48,392
<i>Let's go, Toorope!</i>

34
00:05:48,393 --> 00:05:50,862
Carl is that you?

35
00:05:50,863 --> 00:05:53,038
<i>I'm not gonna ask again!
Let's go!</i>

36
00:05:53,111 --> 00:05:56,601
I thought you were over
the Sudan killing babies.

37
00:05:56,602 --> 00:05:59,962
- Shut up!
- Remember the last time we met...

38
00:05:59,963 --> 00:06:03,065
I told you if you ever
point that gun at me again...

39
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:05,697
- I'd kill you.
- Let's go!

40
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:08,857
Who would hire a babykiller
to get me?

41
00:06:12,376 --> 00:06:14,479
- Watch out!
- Who?

42
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:17,088
- Let's get him!
- Hold your fire.

43
00:06:17,089 --> 00:06:19,721
No shit, Carl! If you wanted me dead
you would've blown up the building.

44
00:06:19,722 --> 00:06:22,454
- Who?
- Gorsky

45
00:06:26,501 --> 00:06:29,315
Karl, you're a disgrace
to the profession...

46
00:06:29,316 --> 00:06:31,818
you're not a mercenary,
you're a terrorist.

47
00:06:33,936 --> 00:06:36,244
You need two things to live
in this business...

48
00:06:36,245 --> 00:06:39,072
your balls and your word...
you don't have either.

49
00:06:40,326 --> 00:06:43,094
You know the difference
between you and me, Carl?

50
00:06:44,697 --> 00:06:46,599
I still got both.

51
00:06:47,521 --> 00:06:48,621
You killed him!

52
00:06:48,622 --> 00:06:51,353
- What the hell's this?
- Take it easy.

53
00:06:51,698 --> 00:06:54,489
What'd you do that for?
Why did you kill him?

54
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:56,290
Personal between him and me.

55
00:08:00,948 --> 00:08:05,026
You are a hard man
to find, Toorope.

56
00:08:05,488 --> 00:08:10,230
I'm not hiding...
You could have knocked.

57
00:08:12,001 --> 00:08:15,775
I needed to be sure that you
are the same idealist...

58
00:08:15,776 --> 00:08:19,129
who worked for me 10 years ago.

59
00:08:19,668 --> 00:08:22,880
So you knew,
I was gonna kill Carl.

60
00:08:23,991 --> 00:08:26,505
I don't like you, Gorsky...

61
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:29,307
you can't trust me
and I can't trust you.

62
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,339
Look at you...

63
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:35,844
still in this shit-hole...
surviving... no friends...

64
00:08:35,845 --> 00:08:37,818
no family, no future.

65
00:08:37,819 --> 00:08:41,510
We are the same...
You and me.

66
00:08:41,511 --> 00:08:43,333
We're not the same.

67
00:08:44,113 --> 00:08:46,000
What do you want?

68
00:08:46,001 --> 00:08:47,902
I need a smuggler.

69
00:08:47,903 --> 00:08:51,521
I don't do refugees anymore,
use your own cargo...

70
00:08:51,522 --> 00:08:53,242
you own the borders anyway.

71
00:08:53,243 --> 00:08:56,387
- Only on this side.
- This is an overseas delivery?

72
00:08:56,389 --> 00:08:59,667
A girl, she needs to be
in America in 6 days.

73
00:08:59,668 --> 00:09:02,433
Why're you playing with me?

74
00:09:02,434 --> 00:09:04,535
You know I can't get back
to that country.

75
00:09:04,556 --> 00:09:08,915
You know the U.N. Passports,
are impossible to fake.

76
00:09:13,564 --> 00:09:16,295
This is not a fake.

77
00:09:16,296 --> 00:09:19,926
Injected in your neck
when pass the official border.

78
00:09:19,927 --> 00:09:22,845
This is your new life.

79
00:09:23,825 --> 00:09:27,792
- I'll do it for half a mill.
- I can make you do it for free.

80
00:09:27,793 --> 00:09:30,379
You can't make me do shit,
Gorski...

81
00:09:30,681 --> 00:09:35,095
but you could pay me what I need,
so I can get the job done right.

82
00:09:36,588 --> 00:09:39,570
A car will pick you up outside...

83
00:09:39,571 --> 00:09:40,911
everything you need,
will be in the trunk.

84
00:09:40,912 --> 00:09:46,222
Cross me and you'll have no
place to hide anymore.

85
00:09:46,223 --> 00:09:48,282
Toorope.

86
00:09:49,915 --> 00:09:52,596
That goes both ways...

87
00:09:52,597 --> 00:09:54,399
Gorski.

88
00:11:09,962 --> 00:11:11,607
Shit...

89
00:12:23,072 --> 00:12:27,161
NOELITE CONVENT MONGOLIA
41*10'N. 74*46'E.

90
00:12:45,706 --> 00:12:48,680
Good morning,
you must be Toorope.

91
00:12:49,219 --> 00:12:51,081
I am sister Rebeka.

92
00:12:51,082 --> 00:12:54,085
I just want to bring three
simple rules to your attention...

93
00:12:54,086 --> 00:12:55,687
before we start our journey.

94
00:12:56,250 --> 00:13:00,003
We?
I'm here to pick up one girl.

95
00:13:00,004 --> 00:13:02,463
Wherever she goes, I go.

96
00:13:02,464 --> 00:13:05,711
That is rule number one...
Rule number two:

97
00:13:05,712 --> 00:13:08,752
The less contact she has with
the outside world, the better.

98
00:13:08,753 --> 00:13:11,917
You're here to protect her
from outside influences,

99
00:13:11,918 --> 00:13:14,721
That includes seeing,
hearing and feeling.

100
00:13:15,559 --> 00:13:19,166
You know, it's a harsh world
out there, sister.

101
00:13:19,167 --> 00:13:21,704
I know...
that is why we live in here.

102
00:13:23,033 --> 00:13:26,562
Oh shit...
okay, what's the 3rd rule?

103
00:13:26,563 --> 00:13:28,661
No foul language.

104
00:13:30,762 --> 00:13:33,361
Do we have an agreement?

105
00:13:38,205 --> 00:13:41,411
You listen
to my one and only rule.

106
00:13:43,292 --> 00:13:45,585
Dont fuck with me...

107
00:13:45,786 --> 00:13:48,730
or I leave you standing
in the middle of nowhere...

108
00:13:48,731 --> 00:13:51,817
with nothing but your ass
to sell, to get back here...

109
00:13:51,818 --> 00:13:53,819
your perfect world.

110
00:13:54,742 --> 00:13:57,202
Do we have an agreement?

111
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:00,443
Obviously,
you're not a gentleman.

112
00:14:00,444 --> 00:14:02,144
Obviously not.

113
00:14:03,515 --> 00:14:05,832
Now, that we have
an understanding...

114
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:07,734
picks up the bag.

115
00:14:12,194 --> 00:14:13,696
No.

116
00:14:39,925 --> 00:14:41,795
<i>YOU ARE HERE</i>

117
00:14:45,002 --> 00:14:47,441
<i>TROISTK TRAINSTATION</i>

120
00:15:35,295 --> 00:15:37,478
What's your name?

121
00:15:37,999 --> 00:15:39,519
My name?

122
00:15:39,965 --> 00:15:41,907
You don't have to talk to him.

123
00:15:41,908 --> 00:15:44,508
You didn't introduce yourself.

124
00:15:45,937 --> 00:15:47,956
My name is Toorope.

125
00:15:48,345 --> 00:15:51,561
- Are you taking as to New York?
- Yes...

126
00:15:51,688 --> 00:15:54,324
Now, please get into the car.

127
00:15:55,468 --> 00:15:58,610
Are you a killer, Mr. Toorope?

128
00:15:59,819 --> 00:16:03,519
Look lady,
I'm just the delivery boy...

129
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,992
and to me,
you're just a package.

130
00:16:05,993 --> 00:16:09,522
I'm not your friend, I'm not your
brother, I'm not your boyfriend...

131
00:16:09,523 --> 00:16:13,049
in 6 days I'm gonna deliver
you and never see you again.

132
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:17,888
Sister Rebeka is right,
we shouldn't even talk.

133
00:16:17,889 --> 00:16:19,641
Come on.

134
00:16:24,949 --> 00:16:26,712
Comfy?

135
00:17:08,445 --> 00:17:12,047
Your Highness,
the child has left the convent.

136
00:17:12,048 --> 00:17:14,336
At last.

137
00:17:14,499 --> 00:17:17,850
Six days until we reveal
our miracle to the world.

138
00:17:23,855 --> 00:17:27,096
Your Highness, press conference
will begin shortly.

139
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:34,882
She's coming... let's pray.

140
00:17:37,246 --> 00:17:41,421
TROITSK, KAZAKHSTÁN
RUSSIAN BORDER TOWN

141
00:18:04,453 --> 00:18:07,692
Let's hurry up, the train's
gonna leave soon.

142
00:18:09,297 --> 00:18:10,992
Take your bag.

143
00:18:13,274 --> 00:18:15,413
Are you realy going
to need all that?

144
00:18:15,414 --> 00:18:18,214
We never can have
enough fire power, sister.

145
00:18:18,665 --> 00:18:20,293
In fact.

146
00:18:20,614 --> 00:18:22,730
Never touched a gun in my life.

147
00:18:22,731 --> 00:18:24,908
Now will be the perfect
moment to start.

148
00:18:24,909 --> 00:18:27,905
No thank you,
I can defend myself.

149
00:18:28,981 --> 00:18:32,954
Stay close, this is the real world,
there's no mercy for the weak.

150
00:18:32,955 --> 00:18:35,948
Just because we are peaceful,
that doesn't mean we're weak.

151
00:18:35,949 --> 00:18:38,016
It does here.

152
00:18:44,273 --> 00:18:46,360
Not so fast,
let me see what you have!

153
00:18:47,768 --> 00:18:51,222
- Change.
- What're you doing?

154
00:18:51,521 --> 00:18:55,647
We located the target...
contact New York.

155
00:18:56,410 --> 00:19:00,257
Patch me through Gorsky...
we found her.

156
00:19:01,185 --> 00:19:04,448
Okay... be careful now.

157
00:19:06,003 --> 00:19:08,220
The Neolite's
will be watching too.

158
00:19:08,221 --> 00:19:10,523
My daughter must not be harmed.

159
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:12,327
Put this on.

160
00:19:14,101 --> 00:19:15,525
Come on.

161
00:19:17,054 --> 00:19:20,372
I'm scared...
can I hold your hand?

162
00:19:22,721 --> 00:19:24,235
Hold mine.

163
00:20:14,239 --> 00:20:16,238
Hang On.

164
00:20:16,807 --> 00:20:18,374
Okay, give me three.

165
00:20:27,879 --> 00:20:30,078
Where did he go?

166
00:20:44,363 --> 00:20:46,244
What're you doing?

167
00:20:46,265 --> 00:20:48,045
Come on.

168
00:21:07,723 --> 00:21:09,224
Hey!

169
00:21:09,325 --> 00:21:11,226
Hey!

170
00:21:11,533 --> 00:21:13,372
Hey, come here.

171
00:21:13,373 --> 00:21:15,230
Hey!

172
00:21:30,477 --> 00:21:33,037
<i>- She is on the run.
- Hey!</i>

173
00:21:33,038 --> 00:21:34,917
Aurora, stop!

174
00:21:36,292 --> 00:21:38,220
Aurora, stop!

175
00:21:46,298 --> 00:21:48,363
<i>- What're you doing?
- Stop! Nobody move!</i>

176
00:21:48,364 --> 00:21:50,548
- Don't go that way.
- She's not used to crowds.

177
00:21:50,549 --> 00:21:53,321
- We have to go there, we have no time.
- We have to get away...

178
00:21:53,322 --> 00:21:56,559
What is wrong with you?
Make her walk or I'll carry her.

179
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,372
- Don't have her...
- No, don't go that way...

180
00:21:58,373 --> 00:22:01,089
- I'll do it now.
- Or we will die.

181
00:22:14,788 --> 00:22:16,292
Come on.

182
00:22:23,263 --> 00:22:28,088
We go to the train,
we need to catch it, come on.

183
00:23:09,547 --> 00:23:15,665
Those tigers in the cage...
they weren't real, right?

184
00:23:17,858 --> 00:23:22,328
Siberian tigers
went extinct in 2017.

185
00:23:22,564 --> 00:23:25,304
The last one died
in the Moscow zoo.

186
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:29,962
What is you? A walking
wildlife encyclopedia?

187
00:23:30,417 --> 00:23:32,200
They were clones?

188
00:23:32,934 --> 00:23:36,559
Second generation clones,
not real tigers...

189
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,265
Copies of copies.

190
00:23:38,266 --> 00:23:40,722
But they're living creatures.

191
00:23:40,723 --> 00:23:42,148
Made by God.

192
00:23:42,149 --> 00:23:45,725
No, they were organic machines
made by man.

193
00:23:45,726 --> 00:23:49,452
God made man in his image,
so what man creates...

194
00:23:49,453 --> 00:23:51,153
is also God's will.

195
00:23:51,154 --> 00:23:54,047
Is this what you teach her
in the convent?

196
00:23:54,506 --> 00:23:58,229
You wanna talk? Tell me what
happened at the market place.

197
00:23:58,821 --> 00:24:01,331
How'd you know
about the explosion?

198
00:24:02,032 --> 00:24:04,589
If I'm gonna protect you...

199
00:24:05,349 --> 00:24:07,900
I need to know
whats wrong with you.

200
00:24:09,248 --> 00:24:13,574
She was scared... her first
time out of the convent...

201
00:24:13,575 --> 00:24:16,370
and you put us in that situation.

202
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:22,926
Your attention please, we're about
to pass through high radiations wall.

203
00:24:22,927 --> 00:24:26,667
For your security, the shutters
will now be lowered.

204
00:24:26,668 --> 00:24:28,752
First time
out of the convent, huh?

205
00:24:56,799 --> 00:25:00,633
VLADIVOSTOK, RUSSIA
REFUGEE CAMP

206
00:25:00,634 --> 00:25:03,836
43*05'N. 131*59'E.
744833 REFUGEES

207
00:25:22,072 --> 00:25:24,076
Stop.

208
00:25:24,575 --> 00:25:26,479
Stop.

209
00:25:30,181 --> 00:25:32,485
All your property goes there.

210
00:25:36,616 --> 00:25:38,119
Stop.

211
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:42,524
All of it.

212
00:25:46,326 --> 00:25:49,531
Okay, we're done here,
let them go through.

213
00:26:06,746 --> 00:26:08,804
Stay close.

214
00:26:10,136 --> 00:26:13,364
- What are we doing here?
- Looking for a plane.

215
00:26:13,365 --> 00:26:16,322
They must be somewhere
around here.

216
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:54,349
- I got them, they're right here.
- Better lay off...

217
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:57,641
be right there in a minute,
and you... dont talk to anybody.

218
00:26:57,642 --> 00:27:00,232
They're splitting up,
what we do now?

219
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:03,221
Everybody maintain their position.

220
00:27:03,963 --> 00:27:06,752
Get up! Dead man.

221
00:27:06,841 --> 00:27:08,864
Hey! Toorope.

222
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:12,888
- How are you?
- How you doing?

223
00:27:12,889 --> 00:27:16,086
What're you doing in this
beautiful part of Russia?

224
00:27:16,087 --> 00:27:18,307
- Watch it.
- Working for who?

225
00:27:18,308 --> 00:27:20,090
Hey! Hey! Two shots.

226
00:27:21,458 --> 00:27:23,402
Gorsky.

227
00:27:27,649 --> 00:27:30,931
He made me an offer
I couldn't refuse.

228
00:27:31,676 --> 00:27:32,863
What can I do for you?

229
00:27:32,864 --> 00:27:35,555
I need 3 passes on the boat...

230
00:27:35,556 --> 00:27:37,717
and 2 snow-bikes
on the other side.

231
00:27:37,718 --> 00:27:41,659
- You crossing?
- I'm delivering...

232
00:27:41,737 --> 00:27:43,931
The girl.

233
00:27:45,198 --> 00:27:46,702
Her?

234
00:27:46,726 --> 00:27:48,711
Who is she?

235
00:27:48,712 --> 00:27:50,713
Hell, I don't Know.

236
00:27:50,714 --> 00:27:52,908
- Where you taking her?
- America.

237
00:27:52,909 --> 00:27:54,487
What America? You're on
the terrorist list there.

238
00:27:54,488 --> 00:27:55,738
Yeah.

239
00:27:55,739 --> 00:27:59,238
You gonna need a passport,
a new identity, you shitting me?

240
00:27:59,239 --> 00:28:02,908
- You got a passport?
- Yeah, and I'm not coming back.

241
00:28:02,941 --> 00:28:04,342
That is a bold move.

242
00:28:04,343 --> 00:28:07,122
I got 50 G's sayin'
you can help me out.

243
00:28:07,123 --> 00:28:09,052
When?

244
00:28:09,087 --> 00:28:10,981
Now.

245
00:28:15,585 --> 00:28:17,676
You don't have to look.

246
00:28:19,117 --> 00:28:21,342
Who is he?

247
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:26,744
He's a lost soul.

248
00:28:35,133 --> 00:28:37,693
See you at the landing,
at 0:600 sharp.

249
00:28:37,694 --> 00:28:39,433
You got it.

250
00:28:40,067 --> 00:28:42,452
- Who was that?
- An old friend, a good smuggler.

251
00:28:42,453 --> 00:28:45,246
- You trust him?
- I dont trust anybody, come on.

252
00:28:50,786 --> 00:28:52,575
Sorry kids,
these girls are with me.

253
00:28:52,576 --> 00:28:54,906
- Just let them go, Toorope.
- How do you know my name?

254
00:28:54,907 --> 00:28:56,803
We know a lotta things
you dont know.

255
00:28:56,804 --> 00:28:57,904
Yeah, like what?

256
00:28:57,905 --> 00:29:00,540
Like, you don't know
what you're doing?

257
00:29:00,793 --> 00:29:03,071
- I'm doing my job.
- Forget your job.

258
00:29:03,072 --> 00:29:06,106
- What?
- One million, tax free.

259
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:13,054
Take the money and walk out
without a fight...

260
00:29:13,055 --> 00:29:15,762
Make it easy on yourself,
Toorope.

261
00:29:26,978 --> 00:29:28,975
After him!

262
00:29:41,512 --> 00:29:42,655
Move.

263
00:30:24,905 --> 00:30:26,738
Help!

264
00:30:30,911 --> 00:30:33,745
No! No!

265
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,852
Aurora!

266
00:30:53,556 --> 00:30:55,222
Hey!

267
00:30:55,358 --> 00:30:58,225
- Aurora!
- Hey, man! Let the girl go.

268
00:30:58,256 --> 00:31:00,459
Just let her go, let her go.

269
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:04,697
Another one is what we got,
another forfeit for Mc'Gilla.

270
00:31:11,576 --> 00:31:15,386
Hey, man! Wait, I didn't say...
I'm gonna do this.

271
00:31:19,761 --> 00:31:21,155
Get over there.

272
00:31:21,156 --> 00:31:22,933
Wanna fight? Let's go.

273
00:31:22,934 --> 00:31:24,442
Come on.

274
00:31:55,839 --> 00:31:57,831
No, stop! Stop!

275
00:31:58,842 --> 00:32:00,342
Stop, Toorope!

276
00:32:00,344 --> 00:32:03,837
Stop it!
Stop!

277
00:32:04,557 --> 00:32:06,854
Dont kill him.

278
00:32:10,223 --> 00:32:12,399
He doesn't want to hurt me.

279
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:20,328
He wanted to protect me.

280
00:32:24,262 --> 00:32:26,406
Your father sent us.

281
00:32:26,407 --> 00:32:29,184
- My father?
- Yes, your father.

282
00:32:29,494 --> 00:32:31,427
Get away from us.
Get away from us!

283
00:32:32,274 --> 00:32:34,109
It's okay, come here.

284
00:32:34,752 --> 00:32:36,284
I have to know.

285
00:32:36,285 --> 00:32:37,906
No, Aurora...

286
00:32:37,907 --> 00:32:39,308
Aurora.

287
00:32:39,448 --> 00:32:41,028
Aurora! Aurora!
Wait!

288
00:32:41,029 --> 00:32:42,930
Stop! Stop!

289
00:32:42,931 --> 00:32:44,332
Stop!

290
00:32:51,569 --> 00:32:53,263
Come on.

291
00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:12,502
Let's go! Come on, let's go!

292
00:33:16,036 --> 00:33:17,846
Move it!

293
00:33:18,094 --> 00:33:19,368
Come on.

294
00:33:19,495 --> 00:33:21,370
Go! Go!

295
00:33:35,143 --> 00:33:37,088
Let her go!

296
00:33:42,968 --> 00:33:45,228
The next one dies!

297
00:33:48,305 --> 00:33:51,651
Come with us...
we're ready to die for you.

298
00:33:51,652 --> 00:33:54,351
I don't want anyone
to die for me.

299
00:34:03,873 --> 00:34:05,448
What the hell
you think you're doing?

300
00:34:05,449 --> 00:34:06,849
What's wrong with you?

301
00:34:06,850 --> 00:34:09,361
- You think this is a game?
- Why did you wanted to shoot them?

302
00:34:09,362 --> 00:34:11,551
- You're trying to get us killed?
- They were gonna let me go.

303
00:34:11,552 --> 00:34:13,148
- You don't know that.
- And what were you gonna do?

304
00:34:13,149 --> 00:34:16,151
Shoot me in the head? Shoot them
'till you ran outta ammo?

305
00:34:16,152 --> 00:34:17,781
Stop it.

306
00:34:24,735 --> 00:34:27,348
I told you,
I take you to New York.

307
00:34:27,349 --> 00:34:29,086
And I will.

308
00:34:29,307 --> 00:34:31,527
You don't have to like me.

309
00:34:36,338 --> 00:34:39,839
They said my father is alive.

310
00:34:40,448 --> 00:34:42,549
No, baby girl, he isn't.

311
00:34:44,201 --> 00:34:45,840
He died.

312
00:34:50,473 --> 00:34:56,990
BERING STRAIT
INTERNATIONAL WATERS

313
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:03,594
This is way too many refugees, the
ice is getting thinner every year.

314
00:35:04,406 --> 00:35:07,223
They're loosing cargo all the time.

315
00:35:09,593 --> 00:35:12,411
They're not gonna all,
get on that boat.

316
00:35:12,986 --> 00:35:15,352
Make sure we do.

317
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:20,273
This god-damn global warming
is bad for business.

318
00:35:37,257 --> 00:35:39,258
What's happening?

319
00:35:40,268 --> 00:35:41,785
Watch this.

320
00:36:28,091 --> 00:36:29,191
<i>Okay!</i>

321
00:36:29,192 --> 00:36:31,392
- There's not much time.
- Now boarding is less then...

322
00:36:31,393 --> 00:36:33,400
They don't wanna be spotted
by satellites.

323
00:36:33,401 --> 00:36:35,302
Hurry, come on!

324
00:36:37,046 --> 00:36:39,299
<i>Now boarding reached 4 minutes.</i>

325
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:59,701
<i>Now boarding reached 1 minute...</i>

326
00:36:59,702 --> 00:37:01,878
<i>1 minute.</i>

327
00:37:06,898 --> 00:37:08,356
Move!

328
00:37:08,357 --> 00:37:09,657
Come on.

329
00:37:36,695 --> 00:37:38,212
No!

330
00:37:42,401 --> 00:37:44,218
Get off!

331
00:37:46,396 --> 00:37:48,265
No!

332
00:37:53,043 --> 00:37:56,313
You can't do this!
They die out there.

333
00:37:56,314 --> 00:38:00,006
- No!
- Stop! Don't touch that!

334
00:38:00,007 --> 00:38:01,672
Get away from there.

335
00:38:01,673 --> 00:38:03,191
- What're you doing? Stop!
- No!

336
00:38:03,192 --> 00:38:06,094
Stop it! Dont do that.
What's wrong?

337
00:38:06,095 --> 00:38:07,595
It's this place.

338
00:38:08,397 --> 00:38:10,278
Hey! Hey! Easy.

339
00:38:10,294 --> 00:38:13,206
- Take it easy.
- Take it easy.

340
00:38:15,238 --> 00:38:17,745
Go back up! Now!

341
00:38:17,771 --> 00:38:22,593
- Okay, okay... relax.
- We go back up.

342
00:38:22,614 --> 00:38:25,097
- Take it easy.
- Now.

343
00:38:25,617 --> 00:38:28,300
No! They're gonna die!
You can't do that!

344
00:38:28,301 --> 00:38:29,521
Let her go.

345
00:38:29,522 --> 00:38:31,499
Don't let them die! No!

346
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:37,189
You just can't leave them there!
They die! They die! They die!

347
00:38:41,242 --> 00:38:45,877
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.
What the hell was that?

348
00:38:52,051 --> 00:38:56,348
When I was 17 years old,
living in San Francisco...

349
00:38:56,449 --> 00:38:58,450
my life was a mess.

350
00:38:59,172 --> 00:39:03,648
I met the wrong man,
I was lost in darkness.

351
00:39:04,873 --> 00:39:07,842
But when the high priestess
of our church opened the doors...

352
00:39:07,843 --> 00:39:11,080
that led me into the path of light.

353
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:16,946
I joined the No-lights...
and I ended up in the convent.

354
00:39:17,781 --> 00:39:21,515
It was the heaven for women,
who needed to heal.

355
00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:26,066
I worked in the orphanage...

356
00:39:27,701 --> 00:39:29,630
she arrived.

357
00:39:30,376 --> 00:39:32,496
A baby.

358
00:39:33,476 --> 00:39:38,272
Her father was dead, nobody knew
anything about the mother.

359
00:39:38,723 --> 00:39:44,966
I took her as my own...
I fed her, I thought her.

360
00:39:44,967 --> 00:39:49,983
Everything was fine...
until 3 months ago.

361
00:39:49,984 --> 00:39:54,619
The doctor came, gave her a pill,
he was with her for 10 minutes...

362
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:56,464
and that's when it started.

363
00:39:56,465 --> 00:39:58,266
Change, huh?

364
00:39:58,267 --> 00:40:02,368
Like schizophrenia...
Spasms.

365
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:06,935
But nothing, nothing makes
sense, is what you saw today.

366
00:40:06,936 --> 00:40:11,142
But how could she know, how to
operate a 30 year old Russian sub?

367
00:40:12,443 --> 00:40:16,367
She's always known things,
that she never experienced...

368
00:40:16,469 --> 00:40:19,998
to walk and speak
when she was 2 years old.

369
00:40:20,246 --> 00:40:22,965
I've never met a kid,
that could speak at 2 years old.

370
00:40:22,966 --> 00:40:25,659
19 different languages.

371
00:40:30,294 --> 00:40:34,376
- Who else knows about this?
- Nobody but the Doctor.

372
00:40:34,377 --> 00:40:38,082
He told me to keep it
a secret to protect her.

373
00:40:39,031 --> 00:40:45,302
He said... that we would get the
best medical help in the America...

374
00:40:47,772 --> 00:40:49,818
She needs help.

375
00:40:51,972 --> 00:40:54,475
<i>Crew, get ready to surface...</i>

376
00:40:55,876 --> 00:40:57,378
Get her ready.

377
00:41:15,765 --> 00:41:18,657
You know, two years ago...

378
00:41:18,704 --> 00:41:23,271
it was in Pakistan, I saw
this viral bomb go off...

379
00:41:24,869 --> 00:41:27,487
I saw it from the air, it was...

380
00:41:30,010 --> 00:41:33,103
incredible, everybody died.

381
00:41:34,652 --> 00:41:37,022
She's carrying, ain't she?

382
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:41,894
All the symptoms fit,
all that weird behaviour.

383
00:41:42,461 --> 00:41:45,267
I tell you what she's carrying...
a weapon.

384
00:41:45,938 --> 00:41:48,774
Do you have any idea,
how much money she's worth?

385
00:41:50,634 --> 00:41:53,073
If she's carrying a virus...

386
00:41:55,570 --> 00:41:59,300
I'll kill her myself
and burn the body.

387
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:11,866
BERING STRAIT
ALASKA

388
00:42:19,929 --> 00:42:22,177
What happened to them?

389
00:42:22,178 --> 00:42:25,246
Fire Drones, anything
that moves is shot on sight.

390
00:42:25,247 --> 00:42:26,806
It's 10 miles to the D.M.Z.

391
00:42:26,807 --> 00:42:28,635
Then, let's make it
10 fast miles.

392
00:42:28,636 --> 00:42:30,137
Let's go.

393
00:42:46,448 --> 00:42:47,449
Look out, they're coming...

394
00:42:47,450 --> 00:42:50,110
Shit, we got spotted.
Hit it!

395
00:43:01,004 --> 00:43:02,636
Break.

396
00:43:07,517 --> 00:43:09,640
Quick, get close to me...

397
00:43:10,382 --> 00:43:12,479
Hop on her bike.

398
00:43:16,899 --> 00:43:18,804
I'll throw them off.

399
00:44:02,805 --> 00:44:04,711
Where are you going?

400
00:44:04,712 --> 00:44:06,487
Pick up on our way out.

401
00:44:06,488 --> 00:44:08,912
We're only a mile
from the border.

402
00:44:14,714 --> 00:44:17,150
- Toorope! We need help.
- Don't worry...

403
00:44:17,151 --> 00:44:18,958
you're almost there.

404
00:44:24,208 --> 00:44:28,206
- Toorope, we need help now.
- Hang on, I'm getting there...

405
00:44:42,762 --> 00:44:45,598
Stop! We have to get Toorope.

406
00:45:02,356 --> 00:45:03,857
Toorope!

407
00:45:05,627 --> 00:45:07,504
He's not dead.

408
00:45:09,235 --> 00:45:10,848
Ahh... shit!

409
00:45:10,913 --> 00:45:12,882
Toorope, stay with me.

410
00:45:13,614 --> 00:45:15,270
He's not reacting.

411
00:45:15,271 --> 00:45:18,683
He's bleeding to death...
I need your help, okay?

412
00:45:23,434 --> 00:45:25,219
We gotta get outta here, now.

413
00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:27,351
It's a small piece of metal.

414
00:45:27,352 --> 00:45:29,469
- I'm gonna take it out...
- What do you need?

415
00:45:29,470 --> 00:45:31,235
Just hold him.

416
00:45:33,765 --> 00:45:36,161
Look, we don't have time
for this, okay?

417
00:45:36,162 --> 00:45:39,163
- They're gonna send more Drones.
- It's alright.

418
00:45:41,102 --> 00:45:44,162
- Have you got it?
- I've got it.

419
00:45:44,305 --> 00:45:46,066
- He's okay.
- There is no bandage.

420
00:45:46,067 --> 00:45:48,441
We should never have come back.

421
00:45:49,563 --> 00:45:51,636
He knows the rules.

422
00:45:52,652 --> 00:45:54,546
I'll save that later.

423
00:45:56,682 --> 00:45:58,083
Hey...

424
00:45:58,084 --> 00:46:02,406
- now you and the passport are mine.
- What are you doing?

425
00:46:02,407 --> 00:46:06,570
- You... I don't need.
- Careful...

426
00:46:16,524 --> 00:46:20,424
Like I said, trust no one.

427
00:46:20,425 --> 00:46:21,927
No Man.

428
00:46:29,049 --> 00:46:32,085
It's good...
Where did you learn to cook?

429
00:46:32,086 --> 00:46:34,270
Rule number one in the
mercenary handbook.

430
00:46:34,271 --> 00:46:36,515
You never had a woman
take care of you?

431
00:46:36,550 --> 00:46:37,785
Auh...

432
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,501
Sorry.

433
00:46:41,743 --> 00:46:44,127
No, not in my line of work.

434
00:46:45,515 --> 00:46:47,415
- Ahh...
- Finished.

435
00:46:48,295 --> 00:46:51,585
- She get's pleasure out of it.
- Cry Baby.

436
00:46:51,627 --> 00:46:53,041
Cry Baby?

437
00:46:57,751 --> 00:46:59,858
What is that?

438
00:47:00,782 --> 00:47:02,552
Pain Killer.

439
00:47:02,693 --> 00:47:05,275
- No, thank you.
- Come on, live a little.

440
00:47:05,276 --> 00:47:07,364
No.

441
00:47:07,365 --> 00:47:09,069
Aurora, stop!

442
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:11,920
Spit it out.

443
00:47:19,148 --> 00:47:24,074
Girls! We made it across
the border.

444
00:47:24,075 --> 00:47:26,059
Here is to survival...

445
00:47:26,432 --> 00:47:28,869
and thank you
for saving my life.

446
00:47:28,870 --> 00:47:31,969
Maybe now you can trust somebody.

447
00:47:33,678 --> 00:47:38,012
We protected each other...
Like family.

448
00:47:44,221 --> 00:47:47,511
We're all going to die
in New York.

449
00:47:52,970 --> 00:47:54,819
Good night.

450
00:48:05,359 --> 00:48:07,841
She's just scared.

451
00:48:08,610 --> 00:48:10,176
Yeah, right.

452
00:48:38,665 --> 00:48:40,896
Go back to sleep.

453
00:48:42,010 --> 00:48:44,820
We still have a long way
ahead of us.

454
00:48:45,386 --> 00:48:47,364
What are you doing?

455
00:48:48,713 --> 00:48:51,703
We go through customs tomorrow.

456
00:48:52,024 --> 00:48:54,462
Can't take these.

457
00:49:03,743 --> 00:49:08,409
You know, when sister Rebeka
first hugged me as a baby...

458
00:49:08,410 --> 00:49:11,464
it was a night like this.

459
00:49:11,991 --> 00:49:18,033
Aurora, that's where I got my name,
from the Chaos.

460
00:49:18,635 --> 00:49:20,496
It suits you.

461
00:49:22,010 --> 00:49:26,358
You're risking
your life for me, why?

462
00:49:28,860 --> 00:49:31,756
I've done my time.

463
00:49:32,515 --> 00:49:37,887
All this killing and pain and...
war, for what?

464
00:49:39,919 --> 00:49:41,990
I'm tired.

465
00:49:43,036 --> 00:49:45,195
Tired of it all.

466
00:49:45,919 --> 00:49:48,284
You're my only chance
out of this now.

467
00:49:48,285 --> 00:49:50,426
And go where?

468
00:49:51,155 --> 00:49:55,043
27 Cedar Grove.

469
00:49:55,992 --> 00:49:59,682
Near Canada, it's upstate New York.

470
00:50:00,258 --> 00:50:02,779
Where my parents had a farm...

471
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:09,185
more like a cabin with a lotta land.
It's probably in ruins...

472
00:50:09,186 --> 00:50:12,485
but I might be able
to fix it up.

473
00:50:15,311 --> 00:50:18,053
There is no place like home.

474
00:50:22,503 --> 00:50:25,448
You can't depend,
on used to be.

475
00:50:25,449 --> 00:50:29,452
For reason to pause 1939.

476
00:50:30,750 --> 00:50:32,283
That's right.

477
00:50:40,437 --> 00:50:41,941
Toorope.

478
00:50:46,869 --> 00:50:50,328
Are you really going to kill me
and burn my body?

479
00:50:53,484 --> 00:50:55,705
I hope I won't have to.

480
00:51:13,314 --> 00:51:17,473
KITIMAT, CANADA
10 miles from American border

481
00:52:49,491 --> 00:52:53,093
30 minutes... Toorope,
the bus leaves in 30 minutes.

482
00:52:53,094 --> 00:52:56,403
There's a plane to New York,
that flies in two hours.

<i>please proceed to gate 211

485
00:53:21,069 --> 00:53:22,960
<i>You are now

486

<i>You walk through the
Main-gate to America.</i>

488
00:53:36,622 --> 00:53:39,170
Welcome to America.

489
00:53:40,632 --> 00:53:42,075
Welcome to America.

490
00:53:42,460 --> 00:53:44,025
Welcome to America.

491
00:53:46,519 --> 00:53:48,146
Stop!

492
00:54:19,419 --> 00:54:25,531
NEW YORK CITY
Population 22.7 M.

493
00:54:46,678 --> 00:54:49,549
<i>A miracle in the making.</i>

494
00:55:03,661 --> 00:55:07,203
<i>Tomorrow is the dawn
of our New Age.</i>

495
00:55:35,444 --> 00:55:40,315
All them we've changed,
we've changed.

496
00:55:45,651 --> 00:55:47,507
Right here, girls.

497
00:55:59,674 --> 00:56:03,154
It's okay, it's safe here.

498
00:56:26,812 --> 00:56:28,313
Here.

499
00:56:32,146 --> 00:56:34,089
Can we turn it off?

500
00:56:34,090 --> 00:56:37,121
Can't turn it off,
you change the channel.

501
00:56:44,721 --> 00:56:47,995
Hey... there's no food.

502
00:56:48,548 --> 00:56:51,248
Guess, we're not
gonna be here long.

503
00:56:58,084 --> 00:57:00,016
What's wrong?

504
00:57:00,017 --> 00:57:02,743
They're all dead.

505
00:57:05,208 --> 00:57:07,702
Sources reported
destruction in Kurdistan...

506
00:57:07,703 --> 00:57:09,805
of a 1000 year old convent.

507
00:57:09,806 --> 00:57:12,147
One of the oldest continually
functioning convents...

508
00:57:12,148 --> 00:57:13,648
in Central Asia.

509
00:57:13,649 --> 00:57:16,450
Now occupied by the ascetic
branch of the Noelite.

510
00:57:16,551 --> 00:57:19,356
The convent was strucked
by a missile late last night.

511
00:57:19,391 --> 00:57:21,648
There were no survivors.

512
00:57:21,649 --> 00:57:24,849
Here are initial reactions
from the Noelite.

513
00:57:24,850 --> 00:57:28,509
It is a tragedy to think,
that even defenseless women...

514
00:57:28,510 --> 00:57:32,917
who made the choice to withdraw from
society and lead a life of purity...

515
00:57:32,918 --> 00:57:36,055
could suffer the attacks from
terrorists, who have absolutly...

516
00:57:36,056 --> 00:57:40,859
no respect, for the lives
of decent, god-fearing people.

517
00:57:41,155 --> 00:57:44,359
We shall mourn our sisters.

518
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:47,473
The Noelites have been
persecuted for too long.

519
00:57:47,474 --> 00:57:50,737
Tomorrow will be the dawn
of a new age...

520
00:57:54,832 --> 00:57:57,714
Congratulations, my friend.

521
00:57:57,715 --> 00:58:01,626
- You made it safe and sound.
- Gorsky.

522
00:58:01,627 --> 00:58:06,012
- Did you destroyed that convent?
- I'm not a terrorist, Toorope.

523
00:58:06,013 --> 00:58:09,102
- I'm a mercenary like you.
- Bullshit.

524
00:58:09,563 --> 00:58:12,618
What the hell...
is going on over here?

525
00:58:14,021 --> 00:58:17,484
You've done your job,
when you turn over the girl...

526
00:58:17,485 --> 00:58:19,867
I'll get paid
and you're home free.

527
00:58:19,868 --> 00:58:24,088
And that tracking device in your
passport will be deactivated.

528
00:58:24,388 --> 00:58:29,409
Deliver the package, my men will
be there to make sure you do.

529
00:58:30,501 --> 00:58:33,147
They never hurt anybody.

530
00:58:33,148 --> 00:58:37,148
- Maybe it was an accident.
- It was not an accident.

531
00:58:37,819 --> 00:58:42,372
It was destroyed right after
we crossed the border.

532
00:58:44,030 --> 00:58:46,974
Would you like to pray with me?

533
00:58:47,887 --> 00:58:50,309
I don't feel
like prayinmg anymore.

534
00:58:59,964 --> 00:59:03,569
Toorope said I'm just
a package to him.

535
00:59:05,848 --> 00:59:08,830
Is that all I am to you?

536
00:59:09,219 --> 00:59:12,599
Of course not, I love you.

537
00:59:30,478 --> 00:59:32,283
How is she?

538
00:59:33,096 --> 00:59:36,103
- Scared.
- Well, she should be.

539
00:59:38,357 --> 00:59:39,583
Who are they?

540
00:59:39,584 --> 00:59:44,122
To the left, the range rover guys,
work for your sect the Noelites.

541
00:59:44,151 --> 00:59:48,726
To the right, the bikers
work for Gorsky.

542
00:59:53,455 --> 00:59:57,540
They're all here
to make sure I deliver.

543
00:59:57,819 --> 00:59:59,903
And if you don't?

544
01:00:02,873 --> 01:00:05,701
It's gonna be a free fall.

545
01:00:08,326 --> 01:00:10,814
Look sister.

546
01:00:10,855 --> 01:00:13,931
We traveled
six thousand miles together.

547
01:00:13,932 --> 01:00:17,612
The truth is, this has been a
suicide mission from the beginning.

548
01:00:17,613 --> 01:00:21,305
They won't let either one of us
walk outta here alive.

549
01:00:22,325 --> 01:00:25,777
That's the doctor, that came
to the convent 3 months ago.

550
01:00:25,778 --> 01:00:29,785
Answer the door,
act like nothing is wrong.

551
01:00:31,140 --> 01:00:33,014
Okay.

552
01:00:40,513 --> 01:00:43,892
- Good evening, sister.
- Good evening.

553
01:00:48,056 --> 01:00:50,005
Good evening.

554
01:00:50,764 --> 01:00:53,498
- Where is she?
- In her room.

555
01:01:15,337 --> 01:01:17,873
You're a bad man.

556
01:01:26,045 --> 01:01:29,843
Thank you Aurora...
Thank you so much.

557
01:01:48,047 --> 01:01:50,537
- How is she?
- She's fine.

558
01:01:50,538 --> 01:01:53,371
- I have to run some more tests.
- More tests?

559
01:01:53,372 --> 01:01:56,260
Hey! What is wrong her?
What's wrong her?

560
01:01:56,261 --> 01:01:59,875
- I'm expecing a call from a client.
- What is wrong with her?

561
01:02:00,189 --> 01:02:01,625
Toorope...

562
01:02:01,626 --> 01:02:04,689
Toorope... let him go.

563
01:02:05,585 --> 01:02:07,421
If you, Please.

564
01:02:10,066 --> 01:02:11,699
Thank you, sister.

565
01:02:19,209 --> 01:02:21,294
- Get over here.
- What's wrong with you?

566
01:02:21,295 --> 01:02:22,984
I wanna know everything
that you know.

567
01:02:22,985 --> 01:02:27,316
Don't you think that if I knew
anything, I will tell you?

568
01:02:27,317 --> 01:02:29,150
No, I don't think.

569
01:02:29,151 --> 01:02:32,459
You're a Noelite, you're
like him, you swore an oath.

570
01:02:32,460 --> 01:02:34,896
Not to them, to God.

571
01:02:34,897 --> 01:02:37,133
God has nothing
to do with it now.

572
01:02:37,134 --> 01:02:41,302
You understand, if she carried a virus
that could annihilate half the city...

573
01:02:41,303 --> 01:02:43,741
I'm not gonna have it
on my conscience.

574
01:02:52,941 --> 01:02:56,709
I'm pregnant... twins.

575
01:02:58,205 --> 01:03:02,374
It's not possible,
I watched over you all your life.

576
01:03:02,404 --> 01:03:05,000
No one's ever touched you.

577
01:03:07,644 --> 01:03:09,413
And nobody has.

578
01:03:09,414 --> 01:03:11,390
It's a miracle.

579
01:03:12,851 --> 01:03:14,547
Shit...

580
01:03:17,081 --> 01:03:20,113
- Hello?
- Mr. Toorope?

581
01:03:20,114 --> 01:03:23,466
- This is the high priestess, I am...
- I know who you are.

582
01:03:23,697 --> 01:03:27,236
Thank you, for doing such
a good job, Mr. Toorope.

583
01:03:27,484 --> 01:03:28,806
You're welcome.

584
01:03:28,807 --> 01:03:31,289
Bring the girl to the
limousine and you'll be freed.

585
01:03:31,290 --> 01:03:35,721
Toorope, if you deliver
me to them, I'll die.

586
01:03:41,768 --> 01:03:43,870
One other the way out.

587
01:04:13,375 --> 01:04:17,758
- We can't let her go, Toorope.
- Look around, do we have a choice?

588
01:04:22,602 --> 01:04:24,999
She's your problem now.

589
01:04:35,903 --> 01:04:37,404
Move!

590
01:04:55,644 --> 01:04:59,854
- We're going on the subway.
- Thank you, Toorope.

591
01:05:13,905 --> 01:05:15,444
What's wrong?

592
01:05:15,445 --> 01:05:17,551
It's a missile
linked to my passport.

593
01:05:18,581 --> 01:05:21,057
How can you stop it?

594
01:05:21,058 --> 01:05:23,105
Only by death.

595
01:05:26,208 --> 01:05:28,250
We're going on the subway.

596
01:05:46,579 --> 01:05:48,534
Toorope!

597
01:05:56,239 --> 01:05:57,909
Aurora?

598
01:07:17,674 --> 01:07:19,840
It's you.

599
01:07:22,212 --> 01:07:23,897
Protect them.

600
01:07:43,593 --> 01:07:46,027
I need you to live.

601
01:08:13,559 --> 01:08:15,793
<i>Aurora was our miracle.</i>

602
01:08:15,794 --> 01:08:18,095
<i>A true virgin birth.</i>

603
01:08:18,496 --> 01:08:20,116
<i>It was to make ours...</i>

604
01:08:20,117 --> 01:08:23,119
<i>the dominant religion on earth.</i>

605
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:26,270
<i>Now we don't know
what's happened to her.</i>

606
01:08:26,271 --> 01:08:29,273
<i>In this mess,
there's no sign of Aurora.</i>

607
01:08:29,395 --> 01:08:31,579
<i>We can't find her.</i>

608
01:08:32,201 --> 01:08:35,987
<i>We were finally on the verge
of becoming a bonafide religion...</i>

609
01:08:35,988 --> 01:08:39,236
and your incompetence has thrown
20 years of careful planning...

610
01:08:39,237 --> 01:08:40,297
down the tubes.

611
01:08:40,298 --> 01:08:42,958
Who gave the order to
use guns to retrieve her?

612
01:08:42,959 --> 01:08:46,838
You left Gorsky no choice...
What were you thinking?

613
01:08:47,805 --> 01:08:49,775
- Your Highness.
- What?

614
01:08:50,257 --> 01:08:53,106
The body stolen from
the morgue was Toorope.

615
01:08:53,107 --> 01:08:56,284
The police found the van, that
transported him to New Jersey.

616
01:08:56,818 --> 01:09:00,755
Who would want to abduct
the body of a dead man?

617
01:09:09,518 --> 01:09:11,464
He's back on line.

618
01:09:21,973 --> 01:09:25,057
- Where're you taking me?
- To Dr. Darquandier.

619
01:09:40,981 --> 01:09:44,065
You should know, Mr. Toorope
is not a prisoner...

620
01:09:44,066 --> 01:09:45,667
you can release him.

621
01:09:49,882 --> 01:09:52,091
Good evening, Mr. Toorope.

622
01:09:52,092 --> 01:09:55,095
I'm Dr. Darquandier,
Aurora's father.

623
01:09:58,579 --> 01:10:02,591
- I thought you were dead.
- It's sometimes useful to be dead...

624
01:10:02,592 --> 01:10:04,458
gives the last one
a second chance.

625
01:10:04,459 --> 01:10:06,417
You'll see.

626
01:10:07,041 --> 01:10:10,589
Oh yes, you were
clinically dead for 2 hours.

627
01:10:10,590 --> 01:10:13,113
We lost quite a bit of time
getting you from the morgue.

628
01:10:13,114 --> 01:10:15,387
And then you went
into a coma for 5 days.

629
01:10:15,388 --> 01:10:18,296
I fixed you up as best I could.

630
01:10:19,165 --> 01:10:22,731
Now, Mr. Toorope, I believe
I owe you some explanation.

631
01:10:24,596 --> 01:10:26,217
You see, 20 years ago...

632
01:10:26,218 --> 01:10:27,960
I was drummed out of
the medical profession...

633
01:10:27,995 --> 01:10:29,261
for trying to implant
human babies...

634
01:10:29,296 --> 01:10:32,262
with artificial intelligence.

635
01:10:32,563 --> 01:10:36,066
Around that time, the Noelites
came to me to create smarter...

636
01:10:36,067 --> 01:10:38,434
stronger, healthier human beings.

637
01:10:38,469 --> 01:10:44,333
So I built a super computer to
be Aurora's artificail mother...

638
01:10:44,334 --> 01:10:49,325
As a fetus Aurora learned
to process information...

639
01:10:49,470 --> 01:10:52,020
just like a computer.

640
01:10:52,793 --> 01:10:57,685
Until she was born, she became
much more than just an experiment...

641
01:10:57,686 --> 01:11:02,011
you see, she became...
she became my daughter.

642
01:11:02,076 --> 01:11:04,301
She was beautiful, she was unique,
and I couldn't bring myself...

643
01:11:04,302 --> 01:11:05,602
to give her away, so...

644
01:11:05,603 --> 01:11:09,419
that's when they hired Gorsky
to kill me and... well...

645
01:11:09,420 --> 01:11:11,722
they almost suceeded.

646
01:11:11,764 --> 01:11:15,917
He took my baby away and hid
her to the Noelites,

647
01:11:15,918 --> 01:11:18,288
I searched for her for years,
but I couldn't find her.

648
01:11:18,289 --> 01:11:20,485
I knew, that one day
the Noelites would have...

649
01:11:20,486 --> 01:11:22,488
to present a miracle
to the rest of the world.

650
01:11:27,640 --> 01:11:31,688
- What do you want from me?
- I want you to find my daughter.

651
01:11:31,689 --> 01:11:33,290
We think she's alive...

652
01:11:33,291 --> 01:11:36,882
and she left you a message,
you died with your eyes open...

653
01:11:36,883 --> 01:11:39,876
but your brain recorded more
than you can actually remember...

654
01:11:39,877 --> 01:11:42,345
we just need to rewind the tape.

655
01:11:42,346 --> 01:11:44,325
You need to return
to the same condition...

656
01:11:44,326 --> 01:11:45,927
you were when we found you.

657
01:11:48,165 --> 01:11:50,153
Almost dead?

658
01:11:51,173 --> 01:11:52,804
Quite.

659
01:11:58,171 --> 01:12:00,152
What am I looking for?

660
01:12:00,153 --> 01:12:02,336
What you missed the first time.

661
01:12:02,591 --> 01:12:05,314
Will guide your memory
with our computer.

662
01:12:05,952 --> 01:12:08,706
Are you ready, Mr. Toorope?

663
01:12:24,159 --> 01:12:25,639
Stay with memory...

664
01:12:25,640 --> 01:12:27,961
stay with the memory,
move forward a little bit.

665
01:12:31,346 --> 01:12:33,835
Focus on the memories of Aurora.

666
01:12:35,293 --> 01:12:37,051
You're beginning to see her...
excellent.

667
01:12:40,301 --> 01:12:43,508
That's right, we're getting there...
We're getting there.

668
01:12:45,077 --> 01:12:48,089
Now... good, focus on his gun.

669
01:12:53,923 --> 01:12:56,612
Easy, easy, steady, steady.

670
01:13:01,203 --> 01:13:03,261
He is way past
the danger threshold.

671
01:13:03,262 --> 01:13:05,276
I know, but he'll be fine...
he'll be fine.

672
01:13:08,708 --> 01:13:11,837
Okay, slow down!
Slow down now. Slow down!

673
01:13:15,107 --> 01:13:17,613
It's the best way to with this...

674
01:13:23,507 --> 01:13:25,633
I need you to live.

675
01:13:41,223 --> 01:13:42,505
He's dead.

676
01:13:43,776 --> 01:13:44,777
Wait...

677
01:13:45,378 --> 01:13:49,594
don't bring him back yet,
he's almost there, he must be.

678
01:14:10,167 --> 01:14:13,243
G O H O M E.

679
01:14:17,637 --> 01:14:21,311
Alright, it's alright, thank god
you're back, you're safe...

680
01:14:21,568 --> 01:14:24,114
- you're save.
- I know where she is.

681
01:14:26,242 --> 01:14:30,029
Mr. Gorsky... I hoped,
I wouldn't have to see you again.

682
01:14:30,030 --> 01:14:31,821
Where is my Money?
You still haven't paid me.

683
01:14:31,822 --> 01:14:34,458
You have an odd way
of killing people.

684
01:14:34,459 --> 01:14:35,978
What are you talking about?

685
01:14:35,979 --> 01:14:39,284
I'm on my way to see our
old friend, Darquandier.

686
01:14:39,285 --> 01:14:42,223
Impossible, I made his
car explode myself.

687
01:14:42,224 --> 01:14:45,513
Mr. Gorsky, when I kill
I kill for good.

688
01:14:45,514 --> 01:14:47,642
- Are you threatening me?
- Bless your soul.

689
01:14:47,643 --> 01:14:50,207
You'll need a nuke to kill me.

690
01:14:52,258 --> 01:14:53,760
Bitch.

691
01:14:56,847 --> 01:14:59,010
How did you survived the blast?

692
01:14:59,011 --> 01:15:02,382
It's the babies you see...

693
01:15:02,383 --> 01:15:04,771
I gave them power...

694
01:15:04,772 --> 01:15:07,862
they're the ones guiding her.

695
01:15:08,363 --> 01:15:10,499
Their aptitude for survival,
is greater than...

696
01:15:10,500 --> 01:15:12,702
anything you could
ever have imagined.

697
01:15:12,703 --> 01:15:14,593
Professor...
your wife has found us...

698
01:15:14,594 --> 01:15:16,294
she'll be here
in a few minutes.

699
01:15:16,358 --> 01:15:20,331
Find a door open, she'll be the
only one who can take her now.

700
01:15:25,685 --> 01:15:27,924
So, where we going?

701
01:15:28,240 --> 01:15:29,677
North.

702
01:15:48,460 --> 01:15:51,370
Hello my dear,
it's lovely to see you.

703
01:15:51,371 --> 01:15:52,772
Where is my daughter?

704
01:15:52,773 --> 01:15:54,885
I see you haven't found her.

705
01:15:55,432 --> 01:15:57,233
And you never will...

706
01:15:57,234 --> 01:15:59,235
you selfish bastard...

707
01:15:59,236 --> 01:16:02,864
20 years ago I gave you the
opportunity you wanted.

708
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:05,760
Now it's my moment.

709
01:16:06,533 --> 01:16:09,822
- Where is my daughter?
- She's not your daughter.

710
01:16:09,823 --> 01:16:12,605
- She comes from me.
- I designed her.

711
01:16:12,606 --> 01:16:17,056
For me, she's my miracle,
she belongs to my church.

712
01:16:17,057 --> 01:16:19,032
Your church is a lie...

713
01:16:19,033 --> 01:16:22,205
you play with miracles,
for your own profit.

714
01:16:27,623 --> 01:16:31,625
- Are you willing to die for her?
- Yes.

715
01:16:42,145 --> 01:16:44,914
Find Toorope...
He knows where she is.

716
01:17:20,287 --> 01:17:21,789
Wait here.

717
01:17:56,418 --> 01:18:00,760
- You're finally home
- What's left of it.

718
01:18:03,544 --> 01:18:06,625
But I came back for you.

719
01:18:09,683 --> 01:18:12,426
Have a little faith.

720
01:18:51,613 --> 01:18:54,811
Toorope! They're coming.

721
01:18:55,986 --> 01:18:57,603
Quick left.

722
01:19:55,989 --> 01:19:58,062
Toorope, they need help.

723
01:19:59,893 --> 01:20:01,265
No!

724
01:20:11,002 --> 01:20:12,861
Take the wheel...

725
01:21:27,173 --> 01:21:28,675
Toorope.

726
01:21:42,747 --> 01:21:44,319
Thank you.

727
01:21:46,144 --> 01:21:48,188
For protecting us.

728
01:21:55,243 --> 01:21:57,944
You're their father now.

729
01:22:11,308 --> 01:22:13,176
Aurora.

730
01:22:15,026 --> 01:22:19,781
That's the first time,
you said my name.

731
01:22:21,761 --> 01:22:23,949
You're gonna be okay.

732
01:22:26,197 --> 01:22:30,135
Take care of them, Toorope.

733
01:22:41,883 --> 01:22:43,678
Hey kids...

734
01:22:45,848 --> 01:22:49,568
There is a storm coming,
we need to go.

735
01:22:58,064 --> 01:23:00,989
- You ready?
- Okay, Dad.

736
01:23:18,955 --> 01:23:28,567
THE END
