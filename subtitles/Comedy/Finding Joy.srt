<i>( Patsy makes</i>
<i>indistinct remark )</i>

Marshall: <i>What do you</i>
<i>want me to say? Huh?</i>

169
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:47,025
<i>It's our busy season.</i>
<i>Patsy: In march?</i>

170
00:13:47,027 --> 00:13:50,361
<i>A lot of people like to get a
jump on their holiday shopping.</i>

171
00:13:50,363 --> 00:13:52,463
<i>Oh.</i>

00:13:52,465 --> 00:13:54,966
<i>They tell me that you</i>
<i>left early again today.</i>

173
00:13:54,968 --> 00:13:57,302
You can't keep calling
my work, pat!

174
00:13:57,304 --> 00:13:59,971
Oh. Oh, I'm sorry, do you work
with the tramp, Marshall?

175
00:13:59,973 --> 00:14:01,973
I work with a lot of tramps.
Oh, my God.

176
00:14:01,975 --> 00:14:03,975
It doesn't mean I'm
diddlin' 'em! Jesus!

177
00:14:03,977 --> 00:14:06,344
My name is tattooed
on your hairy cheek,

178
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:08,313
not some ho!

179
00:14:08,315 --> 00:14:10,215
Who is she, Marshall?

180
00:14:10,217 --> 00:14:12,217
( Laughing ) You think I'm
some huge stud, is that it?

181
00:14:12,219 --> 00:14:15,520
Look at me. Look at me.

182
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:18,022
I'm a mutt. Well, you're <i>my
</i> mutt, and don't you forget it!

183
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:20,525
I think he just came
back to torment me.

184
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:23,895
That is just silly putty!

185
00:14:23,897 --> 00:14:28,199
Kyle is so sweet. Why don't
you just try talking to him?

186
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:31,436
Would you please leave him
out of our sex nest, please?

187
00:14:31,438 --> 00:14:34,439
Okay. I just want you
to be a happy camper again.

188
00:14:34,441 --> 00:14:36,507
Yeah, I will be if you'll
stop your yapping!

189

Gloria! Yeah?

197
00:15:38,972 --> 00:15:40,705
Would it be okay with you

198
00:15:40,707 --> 00:15:42,640
if I borrowed your
mannequin for a while?

199
00:15:42,642 --> 00:15:44,042
Sure,

200
00:15:44,044 --> 00:15:46,411
but she's got no holes in her.

201
00:15:46,413 --> 00:15:49,347
I could introduce you to one
of my girls at the club

202
00:15:49,349 --> 00:15:50,682
with a hole...

203

<i>Holes. And a head, too.</i>

204
00:15:53,353 --> 00:15:55,553
No, that... that is...
That is <i>not</i> what I meant.

205
00:15:55,555 --> 00:15:57,722
You're a sly dog, aren't you?

00:15:57,724 --> 00:15:59,691
You're just like your pop...

207
00:15:59,693 --> 00:16:02,193
A bit of a prick
most of the time,

208
00:16:02,195 --> 00:16:04,228
but, ooh,

209
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:06,731
could he give sting
a run for his money

210
00:16:06,733 --> 00:16:09,000

Are you spying on

that person in the bathroom?

215
00:16:27,587 --> 00:16:30,188
That's sick. You're
a sick peeping tom,

aren't you?

217
00:16:31,424 --> 00:16:32,490
No, no, I'm...

218
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:39,330
With a mannequin fetish.

219
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:42,000
Okay. That's weird.

220
00:16:42,002 --> 00:16:44,602
But I guess everyone
is weird in some way.

221
00:16:44,604 --> 00:16:46,738
Do you live around here?

222
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:49,474
I-I grew up there.

223
00:16:49,476 --> 00:16:51,442
With Gloria and Alan?

224
00:16:51,444 --> 00:16:53,311
They are wacked.

225
00:16:53,313 --> 00:16:55,446
But you don't
hold it against them.

226
00:16:55,448 --> 00:16:58,016
I live there.

227
00:16:58,018 --> 00:16:59,317
It's weird I haven't seen you.

228
00:16:59,319 --> 00:17:00,551
I would remember you.

229
00:17:00,553 --> 00:17:04,655
You're cute in a
boy-next-door-gone-wrong

230
00:17:04,657 --> 00:17:06,257
kind of way. What's your name?

231
00:17:06,259 --> 00:17:09,193
Well, thank... I'm Kyle. Hi.

232
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:13,164
I'm joy. My parents were
delusionally happy.

233
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:16,667
It's fab to meet you, Kyle.

234
00:17:16,669 --> 00:17:19,737
Here. Give me your knuckles.

235
00:17:26,478 --> 00:17:29,180
( Chuckles faintly )
I call that 69 knuckles.

236
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:35,186
Well, you have the
silkiest, uh, knuckles

237
00:17:35,188 --> 00:17:37,255
I've ever sixty... ( Gasps )

238
00:17:37,257 --> 00:17:38,222
Sixty-nined.

239
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:43,194
Are you free at four?

240
00:17:43,196 --> 00:17:44,829
You can say no.
I won't be offended.

241
00:17:44,831 --> 00:17:47,065
It takes a lot to do that.

242
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:48,299
No!

243
00:17:48,301 --> 00:17:50,535
No. Yeah. No. Uh... ( Chuckles )

244
00:17:50,537 --> 00:17:54,739
That... that would be nice.
That sounds nice. Yes.

245
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:58,709
You have a few hours to come up with
a more creative word than "nice,"

246
00:17:58,711 --> 00:18:01,412
or else I will be forced to
put you out of your misery.

247
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:03,514
( Humorless chuckle )

248
00:18:03,516 --> 00:18:06,084
Be my guest.

249
00:18:06,086 --> 00:18:08,786
All right. See you at <i>four.</i>

250
00:18:08,788 --> 00:18:10,154
Four o'clock.

251
00:18:17,529 --> 00:18:19,263
( Muttering indistinctly )

252
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:21,599

00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:23,367
( Steady ticking )

254
00:18:27,406 --> 00:18:28,873
Did someone bite the dust?

255
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:30,608
Uh, no.

256
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:32,743
I-I have a, um...

257
00:18:32,745 --> 00:18:36,881
( Clears throat ) Sort of
a romantic rendezvous.

258
00:18:36,883 --> 00:18:38,549
In nine minutes.

259
00:18:38,551 --> 00:18:40,351
Lose the tie.

260
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:44,689
Patsy: Not good enough,
Marshall!

261
00:18:44,691 --> 00:18:46,524
Why are you home so early?

262
00:18:46,526 --> 00:18:47,558
Did your date cancel?

263
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,760
I <i>told</i> you why.

264
00:18:49,762 --> 00:18:55,233
Yeah? Well, your jacket
smells like lady juice.

265
00:18:55,235 --> 00:18:57,702
It is <i>perfume we are selling.</i>

266
00:18:57,704 --> 00:19:00,605
I could get you a couple of
bottles if you want. Here, dude.

267
00:19:00,607 --> 00:19:02,507
( Fizzing sound; Kyle groans )

268
00:19:02,509 --> 00:19:05,743
Oh, what did you do? I'm sorry.

269
00:19:05,745 --> 00:19:08,146
I have a date...

270
00:19:08,148 --> 00:19:10,348
With the girl across
the street in seven...

271
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:11,816
Seven minutes! The weird one?

272
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:13,784
What's weird about joy?

273
00:19:13,786 --> 00:19:15,653
Oh, so do you also
know the names

274
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:18,756
of the crabby old couple next
door, Marshall? Yes, I do.

275
00:19:18,758 --> 00:19:20,758
I'm very friendly with all of our neighbours.
I'll have you...

276
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,593
Zip! Please...

277
00:19:22,595 --> 00:19:24,929
Zip it.

278
00:19:24,931 --> 00:19:27,231
This was the last decent

279
00:19:27,233 --> 00:19:29,834
pair of pants that I had.

280
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:34,205
Give me yours.

281
00:19:34,207 --> 00:19:35,339
Give me your pants.

282
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,211
I'm at least two sizes
bigger than you.

283
00:19:40,213 --> 00:19:41,179
Try four.

284
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:53,357
Hi.

285
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:55,426
You're impressively on time.

286
00:19:57,829 --> 00:20:00,431
Have fun on your
sort of romantic rendezvous.

287
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:04,969
( Clears throat )

288
00:20:04,971 --> 00:20:06,671
Uh... oh.

289
00:20:06,673 --> 00:20:09,340
Just a, uh, a little nothing.

290
00:20:09,342 --> 00:20:11,976
Oh, thank you.

291
00:20:11,978 --> 00:20:14,812
Is this a book?

292
00:20:14,814 --> 00:20:16,480
I love books.

293
00:20:19,251 --> 00:20:20,218
Ready?

294
00:20:30,862 --> 00:20:32,663
<i>So, did you think of</i>
<i>an alternative word?</i>

295
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:36,367
Uh...

296
00:20:36,369 --> 00:20:38,536
I-it would be my
distinct pleasure

297
00:20:38,538 --> 00:20:40,738
to accompany you this afternoon.

298
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:43,341
It's bordering on bland, but
marginally better than "nice."

299
00:20:50,449 --> 00:20:52,617
So, I-I wrote the book.

300
00:20:52,619 --> 00:20:53,851
Which book?

301
00:20:53,853 --> 00:20:58,022
Right now. Wha...? You <i>wrote that?</i>

302
00:20:58,024 --> 00:21:00,691
Yes. Oh, my God!

303
00:21:00,693 --> 00:21:02,560
I hope it's good.

304
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:06,397
I hope you're good
with condoms too.

305
00:21:08,667 --> 00:21:10,668
<i>I read this article that stds.</i>

306
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:13,337
Are rampant
among senior citizens.

307
00:21:13,339 --> 00:21:16,874
They're getting it on
more than we are.

308
00:21:16,876 --> 00:21:18,709
What am I doing wrong?

309
00:21:18,711 --> 00:21:21,712
( Light chuckle )

310
00:21:21,714 --> 00:21:24,348
I used to work at the condom
factory on Johnson street,

311
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:26,550
and I got tons of free samples,

312
00:21:26,552 --> 00:21:28,486
so I figured I would
put them to good use.

313
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,591
It's really on Johnson street?

314
00:21:33,593 --> 00:21:36,427
So, you're all gonna
remember to use these

315
00:21:36,429 --> 00:21:38,496
next time you have sex, right?

316
00:21:38,498 --> 00:21:40,331
Or you could die!

317
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:42,833
I'm 81 years old, joy.

318
00:21:42,835 --> 00:21:44,068
What's your point?

319
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:45,603
Every second counts, Doris.

320
00:21:45,605 --> 00:21:48,606
( Laughter )

321
00:21:48,608 --> 00:21:51,676
I've brought a friend
along today.

322
00:21:51,678 --> 00:21:52,810
This is Kyle.

323
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:55,479
And Kyle...

324
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:58,816
Is going to demonstrate
how to put one on.

325
00:21:58,818 --> 00:22:00,418
Woman: Ooh.

326
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:02,920
Anyone who wants
a refresher can stay.

327
00:22:02,922 --> 00:22:04,789
( Audience tittering;
Kyle clearing throat )

328
00:22:04,791 --> 00:22:07,091
You should get that looked at.
It might be serious.

329
00:22:07,093 --> 00:22:09,060
I don't... I don't wanna...
I don't wanna do this.

330
00:22:09,062 --> 00:22:11,062
Open the bag. Open the bag.

331
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:17,968
( Women oohing and tittering )

332
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:20,371
I was petrified
you hadn't brought props.

333
00:22:20,373 --> 00:22:22,773
I don't mind if you don't use a cucumber.
Do you ladies?

334
00:22:22,775 --> 00:22:24,008
All: No!

335
00:22:28,447 --> 00:22:31,482
He's wearing ladies' pants.

336
00:22:31,484 --> 00:22:32,950
Yes, they are.

337
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,922
Okay, um, well, we'll just...

338
00:22:37,924 --> 00:22:39,924
( Cat meows )

339
00:22:39,926 --> 00:22:41,058
Woman: Caesar.

340
00:22:42,594 --> 00:22:44,128
Kyle: Okay, so, um...

341
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:45,896
Caesar!

342
00:22:45,898 --> 00:22:49,133
Uh... cae...

343
00:22:49,135 --> 00:22:51,135
Who's... who's Caesar?

344
00:22:51,137 --> 00:22:53,504
He's, uh, he's just this cat.

345
00:22:53,506 --> 00:22:55,005
Local resident.

346
00:22:55,007 --> 00:22:57,675
Um, I'll be right back.

347
00:22:57,677 --> 00:22:58,642
Uh...

348
00:23:10,822 --> 00:23:13,057
( Cat meows )

349
00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:15,426
( Man snoring )

350
00:23:18,697 --> 00:23:20,164
Did he pee?

351
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:24,668
( Cat meows ) Oh, dear.

352
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:28,172
<i>And, uh,</i>
<i>you make sure that, uh...</i>

353
00:23:28,174 --> 00:23:31,575
This part here is up,

354
00:23:31,577 --> 00:23:34,412
like a... like a little hat,

355
00:23:34,414 --> 00:23:36,781
and then, uh, you put it there.

356
00:23:36,783 --> 00:23:38,682
Careful not to cut it
with your nail,

357
00:23:38,684 --> 00:23:41,552
but you just pinch like this.

358
00:23:41,554 --> 00:23:44,088
Sort of... this is
important, that part there.

359
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:47,057
And then you just roll it
down to the, um...

360
00:23:47,059 --> 00:23:49,427
The... the, uh...

361
00:23:49,429 --> 00:23:51,429
The... the base,

362
00:23:51,431 --> 00:23:52,730
roll it down to the base.

363
00:24:06,745 --> 00:24:08,913
Is, uh...

364
00:24:08,915 --> 00:24:10,448
Is everything okay?

365
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:13,117
Yeah.

366
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:15,219
I'm fine. It's no biggie.

367
00:24:17,522 --> 00:24:19,690
Do you mind a pit stop
on the way home?

368
00:24:19,692 --> 00:24:21,759
As long as it doesn't
involve vegetables

369
00:24:21,761 --> 00:24:23,661
or anything related to latex.

370
00:24:23,663 --> 00:24:25,863
I can't guarantee.

371
00:24:25,865 --> 00:24:28,966
So, did you come home
for inspiration,

372
00:24:28,968 --> 00:24:31,635
or to show off your
mad condom-rolling skills?

373
00:24:34,606 --> 00:24:37,107
Funny.

374
00:24:37,109 --> 00:24:39,777
Um, out of necessity, mostly,

375
00:24:39,779 --> 00:24:43,147
but... if inspiration
was to smack me in the face,

376
00:24:43,149 --> 00:24:44,782
I'd absolutely welcome it.

377
00:24:44,784 --> 00:24:45,950
I'll smack you in the face.

378
00:24:51,089 --> 00:24:52,556
Ow.

379
00:24:52,558 --> 00:24:54,558
Anything?

380
00:24:57,662 --> 00:25:00,498
I sort of unofficially adopted

381
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,099
this lonely
little stretch of road.

382
00:25:05,036 --> 00:25:06,770
Ohh.

383
00:25:06,772 --> 00:25:08,506
Ooh.

384
00:25:08,508 --> 00:25:10,140
Ohh.

385
00:25:10,142 --> 00:25:13,277
Poor little thing.

386
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:15,212
Probably never knew
what hit him.

387
00:25:15,214 --> 00:25:17,815
It's a mystery...

388
00:25:17,817 --> 00:25:20,284
The when, how, and if of it all.

389
00:25:20,286 --> 00:25:23,954
I meant more car-bus-moped.

390
00:25:23,956 --> 00:25:27,925
What would you do if you found
out you were gonna die soon?

391
00:25:27,927 --> 00:25:29,860
Try not to.

392
00:25:29,862 --> 00:25:32,930
Wouldn't it shock you out of your comfort
zone and make you feel so alive?

393
00:25:32,932 --> 00:25:35,966
I'm just trying to get through
the lmng part right now.

394
00:25:37,135 --> 00:25:38,302
Mmm.

395
00:25:51,283 --> 00:25:53,284
Kyle...

396
00:25:53,286 --> 00:25:55,286
I found out recently

397
00:25:55,288 --> 00:25:58,155
that...

398
00:25:58,157 --> 00:26:00,558
I'm gonna die soon.

399
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:03,994
Well... shoot that
messenger, right?

400
00:26:03,996 --> 00:26:07,665
( Stifled chuckle )

401
00:26:07,667 --> 00:26:10,701
Wait. You're serious.

402
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:13,637
You're dying.

403
00:26:13,639 --> 00:26:14,605
Yeah.

404
00:26:17,876 --> 00:26:20,878
And you're a writer. Um...

405
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,881
Presumably a good writer,
so I was wondering

406
00:26:23,883 --> 00:26:26,684
if you would write my obituary.

407
00:26:26,686 --> 00:26:28,886
I-I don't want the last thing

408
00:26:28,888 --> 00:26:30,688
that people read
about me to be some

409
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:32,122
grammatically incorrect
piece of crap.

410
00:26:32,124 --> 00:26:35,693
I want my obituary
to be classy and sassy.

411
00:26:35,695 --> 00:26:37,695
I don't even <i>know</i> you.

412
00:26:37,697 --> 00:26:40,064
So we'll probably have to
spend a lot of time together.

413
00:26:45,904 --> 00:26:47,304
All right,
you're acting all weird.

414
00:26:47,306 --> 00:26:49,707
Um... forget I said anything.

415
00:26:51,242 --> 00:26:53,143
Yeah. Yeah, no.

416
00:26:53,145 --> 00:26:55,279
That's... that's in the past now.

417
00:26:55,281 --> 00:26:57,181
Gone. Zap.

418
00:26:57,183 --> 00:26:58,282
Joy...

419
00:26:58,284 --> 00:27:00,217
How would I...

420
00:27:00,219 --> 00:27:01,819
I can't. I can't.

421
00:27:01,821 --> 00:27:04,388
I... I-I can't.

422
00:27:07,258 --> 00:27:08,959
Joy. ( Coughs )

423
00:27:08,961 --> 00:27:10,861
You should get that
cough looked at!

424
00:27:10,863 --> 00:27:12,730
It could be tuberculosis!

425
00:27:12,732 --> 00:27:15,799
It's just a throat-
clearing thing.

426
00:27:15,801 --> 00:27:17,935
( Door slams; Engine
starts ) Uh...

427
00:27:59,144 --> 00:28:02,880
( Crying ) I knew it!
And with a fat chick!

428
00:28:04,149 --> 00:28:05,115
Kyle!

429
00:28:08,219 --> 00:28:11,689
I was prom queen, Kyle!

430
00:28:11,691 --> 00:28:14,692
I was destined to be
blissfully happy forever.

431
00:28:14,694 --> 00:28:17,061
Marshall: Pat, you got my keys?

432
00:28:17,063 --> 00:28:18,395
Ohh!

433
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,967
What?

434
00:28:23,969 --> 00:28:26,370
I'm not chocolicious
enough for you?

435
00:28:26,372 --> 00:28:27,738
Is that it?

436

439
00:28:49,494 --> 00:28:51,929
You see this grey face?

440
00:28:51,931 --> 00:28:53,931
I'll be wearing it from now

441
00:28:53,933 --> 00:28:56,967
till you start being
honest with me!

442

( Knock on door )

444
00:29:14,019 --> 00:29:15,152
Uncle Kyle.

445
00:29:15,154 --> 00:29:16,487
Not now!

Patsy: Come on,
slowpoke, we'll be late!

450
00:31:16,475 --> 00:31:18,308
Mel: I've been going
to school for a decade,

451
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:20,444
and I have never been late!

452
00:31:20,446 --> 00:31:21,478
Bye, grandpa. Yep.

thank you so much
for your concern

493
00:33:07,152 --> 00:33:09,219
for my daughter's fashion needs,

494
00:33:09,221 --> 00:33:12,155
but we can't accept. Take them off.
Why?

495
00:33:12,157 --> 00:33:14,257
She has plenty of clothes. She
doesn't need your cast-off crap.

496
00:33:14,259 --> 00:33:16,426
Kyle: Oh, I... I don't think.

497
00:33:16,428 --> 00:33:18,428
It looks like crap...

498
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:20,297
To this untrained male eye.

499
00:33:20,299 --> 00:33:22,299
( Mumbles )

500
00:33:22,301 --> 00:33:24,534
Come back here, young lady!

501
00:33:24,536 --> 00:33:26,636
Your, uh, your hair.

502
00:33:26,638 --> 00:33:28,305
Oh...! Looks really...

503
00:33:28,307 --> 00:33:29,606
Choose your word wisely.

504
00:33:29,608 --> 00:33:31,375
Ah. ( Chuckles ) Yeah.

505
00:33:31,377 --> 00:33:33,343
Not planning on making
that mistake again.

506
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:39,282
I-in case you didn't
get the message,

507
00:33:39,284 --> 00:33:42,119
uh, I-it would be my honour

508
00:33:42,121 --> 00:33:45,022
to write your obituary.

509
00:33:45,024 --> 00:33:47,524
I accept your non-environmentally
friendly apology,

510
00:33:47,526 --> 00:33:49,493
on one condition:

511
00:33:49,495 --> 00:33:51,728
You have to do
something else for me,

512
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:53,096
right now.

513
00:33:56,534 --> 00:34:01,338
You, uh, never really told me
what it is that you, uh, have.

514
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:02,105
I know.

515
00:34:05,176 --> 00:34:08,645
So, um, who do you look like?

516
00:34:08,647 --> 00:34:11,181
You have any siblings?

517
00:34:11,183 --> 00:34:13,683
Do you fight like cats and dogs?

518
00:34:13,685 --> 00:34:16,386
My brother once broke my
nose with an action figure.

519
00:34:16,388 --> 00:34:18,121
It was an accident.

520

That could be any number
of lung diseases, you know.

523
00:34:36,441 --> 00:34:37,674
Hi, how are you?

524
00:34:46,217 --> 00:34:47,684
This is Kyle, and...

525
00:34:47,686 --> 00:34:51,188
( Loudly ) I'm Kyle!

526
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:53,156
Here, um, I don't... take it.

527
00:34:54,692 --> 00:34:56,293
Bye!

528
00:34:59,564 --> 00:35:02,232
No no. No, that's for you.

529
00:35:02,234 --> 00:35:04,768
A gift. For me? What is it?

530
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:07,604
I want to make my mark on the world
while facing my greatest fear.

531
00:35:10,541 --> 00:35:12,409
Unh...!

532
00:35:12,411 --> 00:35:14,377
What is...?

533
00:35:14,379 --> 00:35:16,546
Joy... put it on, please!

534
00:35:16,548 --> 00:35:18,748
Uh... no.

535
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:22,119
Could you please
put it on, Kyle?

536
00:35:22,121 --> 00:35:25,422
No. Kyle, just put it on!

537
00:35:25,424 --> 00:35:27,124
<i>For future gift reference,</i>

538
00:35:27,126 --> 00:35:29,126
I'm more of a collared
polo kind of guy.

539
00:35:29,128 --> 00:35:31,428
It's called coulrophobia.

540
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:33,797
I'm searching to find
anything cool about it.

541
00:35:33,799 --> 00:35:35,398
It's the fear of clowns.

542
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,767
Don't look at me.
<i>Don't look at me.</i>

543

( Reluctant chuckle )
Don't be a boring fart!

546
00:36:11,636 --> 00:36:13,436

( Shoes squeaking )

548
00:36:29,487 --> 00:36:31,721
Come on! Stick your hands in.

549

Make your mark on the world.

550
00:36:33,325 --> 00:36:36,493
Wait, that's what you meant?

551
00:36:36,495 --> 00:36:39,663
Yeah, cast in cement
till the end of time.

552
00:36:39,665 --> 00:36:42,332
Not particularly
pioneering, though, is it?

553
00:36:44,502 --> 00:36:45,468
You're right.

554
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,675
Whoa, what are you doing?

555
00:36:51,677 --> 00:36:53,343
Body print.

556
00:36:54,745 --> 00:36:56,513
Bod... body print.

557
00:36:56,515 --> 00:36:58,215
Uh...

558
00:37:02,486 --> 00:37:05,522

559
00:37:05,524 --> 00:37:06,923
How's this for innovative?

560
00:37:06,925 --> 00:37:09,826
Yes, your body print is...

561
00:37:09,828 --> 00:37:11,995
Yes, it's one of a kind.

562
00:37:15,666 --> 00:37:18,868

Your family.
Anything and everything.

Your family's weird...

But they are wonderful, and you
should be happy that you have them.

And you? You were raised by...

622
00:40:31,729 --> 00:40:32,896
I killed my parents.

623

It was one of those
freak things, you know?

624
00:40:39,604 --> 00:40:42,439
My parents were always bugging me not
to leave my bike in the driveway

625
00:40:42,441 --> 00:40:44,707
because they couldn't get
their enormous buick in.

626
00:40:44,709 --> 00:40:46,709
But I was this totally
scatterbrained kid,

627
00:40:46,711 --> 00:40:47,977
so I always forgot.

628

from one of their
weekly poker games,

630

and my dad got out
to move my bike,

I think that your bedside manner

00:46:33,458 --> 00:46:35,324

I assume you're Kyle. Yes.

848
00:53:48,326 --> 00:53:51,227
I made notes.
She was very, um...

849

Particular about some
of the details.

850
00:53:53,231 --> 00:53:55,831
She said she took two tiny
sleeping pills so she could sleep.

We pumped her stomach

she tried to kill herself.

Wait. You said that
she could be suicidal!

Can't quote me on that.

Anyway, she never wants to see
your annoying face again.

There was more about your face and some

981
01:02:42,192 --> 01:02:44,226
Skirting the truth. Hm.

982
01:02:44,228 --> 01:02:48,463
Blatantly obvious to everybody here.
He <i>tried,</i> man.

983
01:02:48,465 --> 01:02:49,998
You weren't here.

984
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
Marshall, please.

985
01:02:52,002 --> 01:02:54,336
You don't know
what you're talking about.

986
01:02:54,338 --> 01:02:56,171
He never did anything

987
01:02:56,173 --> 01:02:58,974
to get her any... any help.

988
01:02:58,976 --> 01:03:01,810
Mom didn't want any help.

989
01:03:01,812 --> 01:03:03,311
She didn't want to stop.

990
01:03:03,313 --> 01:03:04,412
That's not the...!

991
01:03:06,249 --> 01:03:10,252
He... he has been mad at me...

992
01:03:10,254 --> 01:03:11,553
For <i>years.</i>

993
01:03:11,555 --> 01:03:14,856
Because <i>I</i> wrote the truth.

994
01:03:14,858 --> 01:03:16,224
Really? Yes.

995
01:03:16,226 --> 01:03:18,960
I never read it. You... what?

996
01:03:18,962 --> 01:03:21,396
I never read your
goddamn book, okay?

997
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:32,200
( Clears throat softly )

998
01:03:36,045 --> 01:03:38,847
You shoulda got the book
on tape, like I did.

999
01:03:44,187 --> 01:03:46,021
More glazed carrots, anyone?

1000
01:03:57,567 --> 01:04:00,101
What are you doing? Not
gonna waste the damn meat.

1001
01:04:19,155 --> 01:04:20,989
For the record,

1002
01:04:20,991 --> 01:04:22,991
I read your book three times.

1003
01:04:25,161 --> 01:04:28,530
I think mine's done, if you...

1004
01:04:28,532 --> 01:04:30,999
Maybe wanna read it.

1005
01:04:32,635 --> 01:04:35,637
No nepotistic
sugarcoating though,

1006
01:04:35,639 --> 01:04:38,006
okay?

1007
01:04:38,008 --> 01:04:39,474
I wouldn't dream of it.

1008
01:05:39,368 --> 01:05:41,336
( Chuckles softly )

1009
01:05:43,372 --> 01:05:45,340
( Sighs softly )

1010
01:06:13,736 --> 01:06:15,103
Can't sleep?

1011
01:06:20,276 --> 01:06:21,343
I don't sleep.

1012
01:06:26,315 --> 01:06:28,483
Mm?

1013
01:06:28,485 --> 01:06:30,286
Before this picture was
taken, your mother had

1014
01:06:30,287 --> 01:06:32,454
this 10-minute hiccupping fit.

1015
01:06:32,456 --> 01:06:34,122
Couldn't get rid of 'em.

1016
01:06:36,459 --> 01:06:37,759
We laughed so hard.

1017
01:06:42,465 --> 01:06:44,132
Oh, I miss her.

1018
01:06:46,469 --> 01:06:48,269
I miss her like...

1019
01:06:53,009 --> 01:06:56,144
Like nobody's
invented the word yet.

1020
01:07:01,150 --> 01:07:03,385
( Sighs )

1021
01:07:14,030 --> 01:07:16,564
I can't leave your mother.

1022
01:07:22,471 --> 01:07:24,739
How long?

1023
01:07:24,741 --> 01:07:27,475
Three years...

1024
01:07:27,477 --> 01:07:29,144
Four months...

1025
01:07:29,146 --> 01:07:33,048
Sixteen days, give or take.

1026
01:07:33,050 --> 01:07:35,183
Oh, listen, just so you
know, that rap music,

1027
01:07:35,185 --> 01:07:36,684
I hate the damn stuff.

1028
01:07:36,686 --> 01:07:40,388
It's the only music your
mother wouldn't listen to.

1029
01:07:40,390 --> 01:07:42,357
Gloria doesn't
seem to mind it, so...

1030
01:07:42,359 --> 01:07:44,492
Do you...

1031
01:07:44,494 --> 01:07:47,228
Do you love her?

1032
01:07:53,536 --> 01:07:55,170
She loves me.

1033
01:08:04,213 --> 01:08:06,181
Don't let that girl go.

1034
01:08:08,217 --> 01:08:10,518
Just do whatever it takes.

1035
01:08:15,224 --> 01:08:17,225
She...

1036
01:08:17,227 --> 01:08:18,560
She won't...

1037
01:08:18,562 --> 01:08:20,795
She won't talk to me.
She won't...

1038
01:08:20,797 --> 01:08:22,163
Come out of her house.

1039
01:08:25,734 --> 01:08:28,103
And I don't know what to do.

1040
01:08:40,282 --> 01:08:42,283
Well, you'll just have
to figure it out.

1041
01:08:47,590 --> 01:08:49,891
You know, we tried
everything with your mother.

1042
01:08:56,432 --> 01:08:57,398
Everything.

1043
01:09:32,835 --> 01:09:35,436
( Audibly straining )

1044
01:09:42,211 --> 01:09:43,444
Joy!

1045
01:09:43,446 --> 01:09:46,447
Joy!

1046
01:09:46,449 --> 01:09:48,383
Joy!

1047
01:09:48,385 --> 01:09:49,851
( Snoring )

1048
01:09:49,853 --> 01:09:51,486
( Knocking on door )

1049
01:09:52,555 --> 01:09:55,223
Oh. Kyle!

1050
01:09:55,225 --> 01:09:56,658
Come on!

1051
01:09:56,660 --> 01:10:00,628
Get your ass downstairs!
Come on!

1052
01:10:00,630 --> 01:10:02,730
Kyle, come on!

1053
01:10:02,732 --> 01:10:04,432
You're gonna love it! Ha!

1054
01:10:06,669 --> 01:10:08,203
( Muffled cries )

1055
01:10:08,205 --> 01:10:10,605
Oh, my <i>God!</i>
<i>What... are you okay?</i>

1056
01:10:10,607 --> 01:10:12,774
When she came out,
you were sleeping.

1057
01:10:12,776 --> 01:10:14,275
Patsy: We panicked! What are you doing?
What are you doing?

1058
01:10:14,277 --> 01:10:15,777
We've got her tied up
really nice!

1059
01:10:15,779 --> 01:10:17,478
Yes! And I am untying her!

1060
01:10:17,480 --> 01:10:18,780
Yeah, but she doesn't
have a choice now.

1061
01:10:18,782 --> 01:10:20,315
She has to listen
to what you have to say.

1062
01:10:20,317 --> 01:10:21,649
Yes, and that all makes sense...

1063
01:10:21,651 --> 01:10:22,884
Uh-huh... until you
bring in the whole part

1064
01:10:22,886 --> 01:10:24,819
that it's a <i>crime</i> thing!

1065
01:10:24,821 --> 01:10:26,421
Out! I'm sorry, joy. I'm sorry.

1066
01:10:26,423 --> 01:10:27,989
Ow!

1067
01:10:27,991 --> 01:10:29,757
All right, go, go, go. We're
leaving, we're leaving.

1068
01:10:29,759 --> 01:10:30,992
You're making a mistake.
I'm <i>not</i> making a mistake!

1069
01:10:30,994 --> 01:10:32,660
I'm going, I'm going! Jeez! Out!

1070
01:10:32,662 --> 01:10:34,529
Like, go rob a bank
or something!

1071
01:10:36,398 --> 01:10:38,466
( Muffled bellow )
I am... ohh...!

1072
01:10:38,468 --> 01:10:40,268
Oh, God, I am sorry.

1073
01:10:40,270 --> 01:10:42,804
Get me out of this right now.

1074
01:10:42,806 --> 01:10:45,340
Yes, yes. Uh...

1075
01:10:45,342 --> 01:10:46,574
( Chuckles )

1076
01:10:46,576 --> 01:10:49,010
Y-you wrote the
classiest, sassiest obit

1077
01:10:49,012 --> 01:10:50,678
that I-I've ever read,
and I don't want it

1078
01:10:50,680 --> 01:10:52,347
to be published
for a long, long time.

1079
01:10:52,349 --> 01:10:53,681
Well, I don't have long, Kyle.

1080
01:10:53,683 --> 01:10:55,550
Have you been paying
any attention?

1081
01:10:55,552 --> 01:10:56,818
I know you're not dying.

1082
01:10:59,888 --> 01:11:02,824
The doctors, they can't find
anything physically wrong with you.

1083
01:11:02,826 --> 01:11:05,526
Mentally could be a whole
other story at this point.

1084
01:11:05,528 --> 01:11:07,729
You're crazy. <i>I'm</i> crazy?

1085
01:11:07,731 --> 01:11:09,530
Yes, you don't know
what you're talking about.

1086
01:11:09,532 --> 01:11:12,600
Please, please, enlighten me.
All right.

1087
01:11:12,602 --> 01:11:15,937
That mri, it didn't even
show a cracked toenail.

1088
01:11:15,939 --> 01:11:17,972
And that's a bad thing...?
Yes, because if I'm not...

1089
01:11:17,974 --> 01:11:20,508
Dying of a disease, it means that
I'm dying of something unexpected,

1090
01:11:20,510 --> 01:11:24,279
but why do you think
that you're <i>dying</i> at all?

1091
01:11:29,518 --> 01:11:32,720
What are you guys doin'?
All: Shh!

1092
01:11:32,722 --> 01:11:34,522
Because he's never wrong.

1093
01:11:36,592 --> 01:11:39,694
Who is... who is never wrong?

1094
01:11:39,696 --> 01:11:42,430
Who is never wrong? Who?

1095
01:11:42,432 --> 01:11:43,898
Caesar, okay?

1096
01:11:45,901 --> 01:11:47,068
Caesar?

1097
01:11:49,905 --> 01:11:51,472
Caesar the cat?

1098
01:11:52,941 --> 01:11:54,709
He's psychic.

1099
01:11:54,711 --> 01:11:57,045
The cat?

1100
01:11:57,047 --> 01:11:58,413
Yes.

1101
01:11:59,782 --> 01:12:03,718
A psychic cat told you you
were going to die. Yes.

1102
01:12:03,720 --> 01:12:07,422
Every resident that Caesar pees
on dies within a few weeks.

1103
01:12:07,424 --> 01:12:09,991
Somehow, he just <i>knows.</i>

1104
01:12:09,993 --> 01:12:11,759
Kyle, Caesar peed on me.

1105
01:12:15,631 --> 01:12:17,865
Maybe he has
a bladder condition, then.

1106
01:12:20,703 --> 01:12:22,870
I'm... ( Clears throat )
Sorry! Sorry! Listen!

1107
01:12:22,872 --> 01:12:24,872
I can't... I can't believe
that you believe this!

1108
01:12:24,874 --> 01:12:26,841
Give me one reason
why I shouldn't.

1109
01:12:29,778 --> 01:12:31,813
I'm going to bed now!

1110
01:12:31,815 --> 01:12:32,814
Forever!

1111
01:12:35,751 --> 01:12:37,585
Joy.

1112
01:12:37,587 --> 01:12:39,620
Joy!

1113
01:12:39,622 --> 01:12:40,855
Joy.

1114
01:12:40,857 --> 01:12:42,724
J-joy!

1115
01:12:42,726 --> 01:12:45,827
Joy!

1116
01:12:45,829 --> 01:12:48,062
Kyle, baby.

1117
01:12:48,064 --> 01:12:50,832
I once knew this girl
who had a psychic twat.

1118
01:12:50,834 --> 01:12:52,700
Any guy who got close,

1119
01:12:52,702 --> 01:12:55,403
she knew if he had
an std or not.

1120
01:12:55,405 --> 01:12:57,438
I think what Gloria
is trying to say

1121
01:12:57,440 --> 01:12:59,407
is that maybe
it isn't impossible

1122
01:12:59,409 --> 01:13:01,509
that this cat has
psychic abilities.

1123
01:13:01,511 --> 01:13:02,744
Gloria: Exactly.

1124
01:13:02,746 --> 01:13:04,912
You gotta prove to her
she's crazy, man!

1125
01:13:04,914 --> 01:13:07,515
I mean, no cat pee
ever killed anybody!

1126
01:13:07,517 --> 01:13:09,584
I don't think it's
the pee per se, marsh.

1127
01:13:09,586 --> 01:13:11,919
Show her you love her.
Shower her with romance.

1128
01:13:11,921 --> 01:13:14,422
Gloria: I know some
hot strip-o-grams.

1129
01:13:14,424 --> 01:13:17,392
Throw her a lmng funeral.

1130
01:13:17,394 --> 01:13:20,561
I was planning one
one for your mom,

1131
01:13:20,563 --> 01:13:22,864
but she passed before
we got to do it.

1132
01:13:31,707 --> 01:13:34,041
<i>No, I want the</i> best
<i>chairs you got.</i>

1133
01:13:34,043 --> 01:13:36,577
<i>What, do I sound</i>
<i>like a cheapwad?</i>

1134
01:13:36,579 --> 01:13:38,880
Yeah, well,
you sound like a dickwad.

1135
01:13:38,882 --> 01:13:41,849
Uh, thanks, Gloria.
I been through all of 'em.

1136
01:13:41,851 --> 01:13:44,719
I think I'm gonna
go with this one.

1137
01:13:44,721 --> 01:13:46,421
Oh, I like it,
but is it big enough?

1138
01:13:53,028 --> 01:13:55,196

with any luck. ( Engine hesitates )

1148

She'll see her theory disintegrate into thin air.
( Engine hesitates )

1149
01:14:53,122 --> 01:14:55,723
I'll do my damndest to make
sure he pees on me, man.

1150
01:14:55,725 --> 01:14:58,059
That is one stinky puss, though.

Just drive. Go!

Yeah.

Did you go to all this
trouble for me?

I'll make a deal with you:

1166

you weren't you?

Dude... she's not coming.

1180

penning her obituary

for the past couple of weeks
as part of my new book,

1196
01:17:54,837 --> 01:17:59,106
but I-it's become apparent
that this...

1197
