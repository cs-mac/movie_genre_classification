1
00:00:31,083 --> 00:00:32,065
Is it recording?

2
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:33,098
Yeah.

3
00:00:33,195 --> 00:00:34,819
All right.

4
00:00:34,922 --> 00:00:37,573
All right.
Can we clear this area, please?

5
00:00:39,498 --> 00:00:40,481
See that?

6
00:00:40,586 --> 00:00:42,724
I talk, people listen.

7
00:00:42,826 --> 00:00:43,686
Hi, babe.

8
00:00:43,785 --> 00:00:45,640
- Hi, babe.
- How are you?

9
00:00:45,738 --> 00:00:46,850
I'm good.
How are you?

10
00:00:46,953 --> 00:00:48,709
I'm good.
You having fun?

11
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:50,217
Yeah. Are you having fun?

12
00:00:50,314 --> 00:00:52,169
- You look mighty tan.
- Hey!

13
00:00:52,266 --> 00:00:54,948
Oh, my God!

14
00:00:55,048 --> 00:00:55,998
Do it again.

15
00:00:56,105 --> 00:00:56,966
Do it again. Ready?

16
00:00:57,065 --> 00:00:58,788
Hold on.

17
00:01:01,482 --> 00:01:02,594
Hey, dude.

18
00:01:02,697 --> 00:01:04,257
- Zachy poo.
- What's up, baby?

19
00:01:04,361 --> 00:01:06,727
Hi, Zachy poo.

20
00:01:06,824 --> 00:01:09,061
I see.

21
00:01:09,161 --> 00:01:10,535
You want to get in on this, Lauren?

22
00:01:10,633 --> 00:01:12,488
Come here. Come on.

23
00:01:12,585 --> 00:01:13,532
Who loves you, baby?

24
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,501
You do.

25
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:15,746
Of course.

26
00:01:15,849 --> 00:01:16,961
Oh, I'm gonna throw up.

27
00:01:17,064 --> 00:01:19,585
Shut up.

28
00:01:19,689 --> 00:01:21,063
Are you a little jealous, Zach?

29
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,338
A little jealous?

30
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,262
I thought your girl was throwing me
some rhythm there.

31
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,669
What do you mean "my girl"?

32
00:01:25,768 --> 00:01:26,881
Yeah, what do you mean "his girl"?

33
00:01:26,984 --> 00:01:28,326
Come on, you two.

34
00:01:28,425 --> 00:01:29,504
I ain't nobody's girl.

35
00:01:29,608 --> 00:01:30,623
Enough with the charade.

36
00:01:30,729 --> 00:01:32,768
All right.
Why are you still here?

37
00:01:32,873 --> 00:01:34,498
Because nobody's following me.

38
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,493
Where are we, by the way?

39
00:01:35,592 --> 00:01:36,453
Does anybody know?

40
00:01:36,552 --> 00:01:38,178
El Matador, homey.

41
00:01:38,281 --> 00:01:39,458
El Matador.

42
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,934
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

43
00:01:41,032 --> 00:01:42,494
You guys are my best friends.

44
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,810
No shit.

45
00:01:43,911 --> 00:01:44,991
Okay.

46
00:01:45,095 --> 00:01:45,957
Hi, guys.

47
00:01:47,912 --> 00:01:49,439
I'm totally gonna puke.

48
00:01:49,545 --> 00:01:51,333
Guys, do you think--
Guys, do you think

49
00:01:51,432 --> 00:01:53,320
we're gonna know
each other forever?

50
00:01:53,416 --> 00:01:54,692
- Nah!
- Shut up.

51
00:01:54,791 --> 00:01:56,100
I fucking hope not.

52
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:58,589
Let's create some memories.

53
00:01:58,696 --> 00:02:00,222
Come on.

54
00:02:00,327 --> 00:02:02,531
Nice, Zach.

55
00:02:02,632 --> 00:02:05,795
I can't drink, man.
I gotta do this to get high.

56
00:02:05,895 --> 00:02:07,935
Oh, be careful.
Come on.

57
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:09,414
Hey!

58
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,526
Holy shit.

59
00:02:17,767 --> 00:02:19,774
Pretty fucking funny, Zach.

60
00:02:19,878 --> 00:02:22,813
- Give me the camera.
- My fucking arm.

61
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:31,077
Hey, man.
You all right?

62
00:02:32,487 --> 00:02:34,624
Do I look all right?

63
00:02:59,878 --> 00:03:01,569
He's over me.

64
00:03:01,669 --> 00:03:02,685
Oh, that I don't believe.

65
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:03,650
Whatever.

66
00:03:03,749 --> 00:03:05,243
No way any man could ever
get over you.

67
00:03:05,348 --> 00:03:07,258
- Because I'm great in bed, right?
- Funny. Boy.

68
00:03:07,365 --> 00:03:09,731
Wow. When's the last time
you saw these guys?

69
00:03:09,829 --> 00:03:11,357
5 years.

70
00:03:11,461 --> 00:03:13,664
If you don't behave--
Oh, boy.

71
00:03:13,765 --> 00:03:16,099
# Frere Jacques #

72
00:03:16,197 --> 00:03:17,921
# Frere Jacques #

73
00:03:18,021 --> 00:03:19,711
# Dormez-vous? #

74
00:03:19,813 --> 00:03:21,307
# Dormez-vous? #

75
00:03:21,413 --> 00:03:23,071
# Sonnez les matines #

76
00:03:23,174 --> 00:03:24,667
# Sonnez les matines #

77
00:03:24,772 --> 00:03:28,034
# Ding dang dong,
ding dang dong #

78
00:03:28,132 --> 00:03:29,693
# Are you sleeping? #

79
00:03:29,797 --> 00:03:31,323
# Are you sleeping #

80
00:03:31,429 --> 00:03:32,890
# Baby Sarah? #

81
00:03:32,997 --> 00:03:34,523
# Baby Sarah #

82
00:03:34,628 --> 00:03:35,937
# She's not crying anymore #

83
00:03:36,036 --> 00:03:37,498
# So I think that's good #

84
00:03:37,605 --> 00:03:39,098
# Ding dang dong #

85
00:03:39,204 --> 00:03:40,699
# Ding dang dong #

86
00:03:40,805 --> 00:03:41,918
# Frere Jacques #

87
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:43,710
# Frere Jacques #

88
00:03:43,811 --> 00:03:45,121
# Dormez-vous? #

89
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:46,594
# Dormez-vous? #

90
00:03:52,709 --> 00:03:53,656
Hey, guys!

91
00:03:53,763 --> 00:03:54,712
Hey!

92
00:03:57,891 --> 00:03:58,752
Nice touch.

93
00:04:44,129 --> 00:04:45,558
Damn.

94
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:46,877
Boy toys.

95
00:04:46,978 --> 00:04:49,182
Hey, Lauren.

96
00:04:49,281 --> 00:04:50,144
Amy!

97
00:04:50,242 --> 00:04:52,413
- Hey!
- Wow!

98
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:57,024
What you got there?
Hi.

99
00:04:58,658 --> 00:05:00,446
Wow. You have a family.

100
00:05:00,545 --> 00:05:02,368
- Wow.
- Can you take her for a sec?

101
00:05:02,466 --> 00:05:03,545
Okay.

102
00:05:03,649 --> 00:05:06,846
- Good to see you.
- You, too.

103
00:05:06,946 --> 00:05:08,189
You and Zach came together.

104
00:05:08,289 --> 00:05:09,719
He just picked me up
at the bus station.

105
00:05:09,826 --> 00:05:12,160
My butt's still dizzy. Whoa!

106
00:05:12,257 --> 00:05:14,558
There you go.
Back to mom.

107
00:05:14,657 --> 00:05:16,480
Wow, she's heavy.
Cute kid.

108
00:05:16,577 --> 00:05:18,071
Thank you.

109
00:05:18,177 --> 00:05:20,599
And where's the birthday boy?

110
00:05:20,705 --> 00:05:22,396
Hey, mom.

111
00:05:22,497 --> 00:05:23,740
Wow.

112
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,150
Hi. Who's this?

113
00:05:25,248 --> 00:05:26,361
This is Sarah.

114
00:05:26,464 --> 00:05:28,320
Hi.

115
00:05:28,417 --> 00:05:29,944
I'm uncle Zach.

116
00:05:30,049 --> 00:05:31,161
Yes. Oh!

117
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:32,825
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

118
00:05:32,928 --> 00:05:34,237
So good to see you.

119
00:05:34,336 --> 00:05:35,350
I'll second that.

120
00:05:35,455 --> 00:05:36,918
James. Heard a lot about you.

121
00:05:37,024 --> 00:05:38,747
Likewise.

122
00:05:38,848 --> 00:05:40,572
Okay, let's go see this thing, huh?

123
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:41,785
Yeah.

124
00:05:41,889 --> 00:05:43,164
Which one's the Godspeed?

125
00:05:43,264 --> 00:05:44,955
I don't think it will be hard to spot.

126
00:05:45,056 --> 00:05:47,195
Go on.

127
00:05:47,297 --> 00:05:48,224
It's okay.

128
00:05:48,321 --> 00:05:49,597
I promise.

129
00:06:14,431 --> 00:06:17,747
Marco.

130
00:06:17,856 --> 00:06:20,855
Polo.

131
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:22,138
Marco!

132
00:06:22,239 --> 00:06:24,627
You're always cheating.

133
00:06:24,734 --> 00:06:26,164
I'm only cheating if you lose.

134
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:36,506
Yo, dickhead.

135
00:06:51,614 --> 00:06:53,043
Come on, Amy.
You can do it.

136
00:06:54,941 --> 00:06:56,219
I'm right here, honey.

137
00:07:02,014 --> 00:07:03,474
There you go.

138
00:07:03,581 --> 00:07:06,396
Easy as pie. See?

139
00:07:06,493 --> 00:07:08,020
Danny always said he'd be
a millionaire by 30.

140
00:07:08,126 --> 00:07:09,173
Even back in high school.

141
00:07:09,277 --> 00:07:10,837
You said the same thing.

142
00:07:10,941 --> 00:07:11,803
Yeah, but I was kidding.

143
00:07:11,902 --> 00:07:13,111
Let's give ourselves the tour.

144
00:07:13,213 --> 00:07:14,838
Where the hell is he?

145
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,283
I don't know about you guys,

146
00:07:16,382 --> 00:07:18,388
but I gotta pee.

147
00:07:19,966 --> 00:07:21,078
Watch your step, babe.

148
00:07:21,182 --> 00:07:23,156
Hey, Lauren, I think I found--

149
00:07:23,261 --> 00:07:24,505
I guess not.

150
00:07:27,325 --> 00:07:29,081
Classic Dan.

151
00:07:29,181 --> 00:07:30,424
He's having breakfast.

152
00:07:30,525 --> 00:07:32,118
Well, it's about time.

153
00:07:32,221 --> 00:07:34,075
Who's next?

154
00:07:35,548 --> 00:07:36,726
This little vixen is Michelle.

155
00:07:36,828 --> 00:07:37,810
Say hi.

156
00:07:37,917 --> 00:07:39,641
It's nice to meet you guys!

157
00:07:41,245 --> 00:07:42,935
See you in, like, two minutes.

158
00:07:43,036 --> 00:07:44,018
That's all it takes.

159
00:07:45,116 --> 00:07:45,977
Happy birthday.

160
00:07:46,077 --> 00:07:47,004
- Thank you.
- Great.

161
00:07:47,101 --> 00:07:48,442
Our daughter is scarred for life.

162
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:49,970
She'll either grow up
to be oddly attracted

163
00:07:50,077 --> 00:07:51,092
to Popeye or a lesbian.

164
00:07:51,197 --> 00:07:52,625
Yo. Where's my gift?

165
00:07:52,731 --> 00:07:54,259
My presence is your present.

166
00:07:54,364 --> 00:07:55,509
Awesome.

167
00:07:55,612 --> 00:07:58,481
Do you have the receipt?

168
00:08:00,028 --> 00:08:03,061
Jeez.

169
00:08:03,164 --> 00:08:04,724
I wonder what this is.

170
00:08:04,827 --> 00:08:06,683
# For he's a jolly big asshole #

171
00:08:06,779 --> 00:08:08,241
# For he's a jolly big asshole #

172
00:08:08,347 --> 00:08:11,130
# For he's a jolly big asshole #

173
00:08:11,228 --> 00:08:13,300
He's 30 fucking years old.

174
00:08:15,611 --> 00:08:16,472
Who modeled for these?

175
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:17,749
"Breast wishes."
Very clever.

176
00:08:17,851 --> 00:08:18,712
Can't wait to taste them.

177
00:08:18,811 --> 00:08:20,917
I wanted to get you real ones.

178
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:22,579
Okay.

179
00:08:56,794 --> 00:08:58,517
# Yo ho ho #

180
00:08:58,617 --> 00:09:00,528
# It's a pervert's life for me #

181
00:09:00,634 --> 00:09:03,633
This is a nice fucking boat,
Mr. Rockefeller.

182
00:09:03,738 --> 00:09:04,817
Business must be good.

183
00:09:04,922 --> 00:09:06,067
- You like, huh?
- Yeah.

184
00:09:06,169 --> 00:09:09,039
Me, too.
I like very much.

185
00:09:09,146 --> 00:09:10,805
And I want to keep it that way.

186
00:09:10,906 --> 00:09:13,239
No smoking on board, birthday boy.

187
00:09:13,337 --> 00:09:14,231
Are you fucking kidding me?

188
00:09:14,329 --> 00:09:16,151
Baby's brand-new.

189
00:09:18,714 --> 00:09:20,689
How long you been running drugs?

190
00:09:20,793 --> 00:09:22,997
I prefer to make my fortune
the old fashioned way.

191
00:09:23,097 --> 00:09:23,958
How's that?

192
00:09:24,057 --> 00:09:25,398
With other people's money.

193
00:09:25,496 --> 00:09:27,864
All right, so, this is just what--

194
00:09:27,962 --> 00:09:30,101
Your getaway vehicle?

195
00:09:30,201 --> 00:09:31,728
I like it fine where I am.

196
00:09:33,016 --> 00:09:34,064
Hey, Sarah.

197
00:09:34,169 --> 00:09:36,111
You want to take a nap?

198
00:09:37,497 --> 00:09:39,919
There we are, huh?

199
00:09:40,025 --> 00:09:43,799
Are you having fun
on this big ole bed?

200
00:09:43,896 --> 00:09:44,943
Who's my girl?

201
00:09:45,049 --> 00:09:46,990
You are.
Aren't you?

202
00:09:51,672 --> 00:09:54,988
Now let's see if mommy can relax.

203
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:57,071
You've already done the hard part.

204
00:09:57,176 --> 00:09:58,964
- You think?
- Sure.

205
00:09:59,064 --> 00:10:03,155
You got on board.
You scaled the wall.

206
00:10:03,255 --> 00:10:05,677
Your mommy's crazy, sweetheart.

207
00:10:05,784 --> 00:10:07,377
I hope you'll come
visit me in the madhouse

208
00:10:07,479 --> 00:10:08,756
when you're older.

209
00:10:08,856 --> 00:10:12,152
No. Your mom's acting human.

210
00:10:17,175 --> 00:10:19,117
Party time, people!

211
00:10:19,223 --> 00:10:20,915
Nothing like starting the day

212
00:10:21,015 --> 00:10:22,803
with a screaming orgasm,
isn't that right, baby?

213
00:10:22,902 --> 00:10:24,048
I don't know, you tell me.

214
00:10:24,151 --> 00:10:25,012
Look at that ass, Lauren.

215
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:31,793
It's time for you to stop being
the perfect, caring husband,

216
00:10:31,896 --> 00:10:33,356
because I'm fine.

217
00:10:33,462 --> 00:10:35,285
No more talk.

218
00:10:40,408 --> 00:10:41,836
Time to get our groove on.

219
00:10:46,198 --> 00:10:47,824
Are we getting old?

220
00:10:47,927 --> 00:10:48,875
Not yet.

221
00:10:48,983 --> 00:10:50,990
Good.

222
00:10:57,046 --> 00:10:59,632
It's been one major
adrenaline rush for us

223
00:10:59,734 --> 00:11:00,912
ever since we met.

224
00:11:01,014 --> 00:11:03,021
So, uh, how many hours
has it been exactly?

225
00:11:03,126 --> 00:11:05,974
For your information,
not that it's any of your business,

226
00:11:06,071 --> 00:11:09,365
we've known each other
for exactly--um, babe?

227
00:11:12,022 --> 00:11:17,007
Two weeks, one day,
and 4 1/2 hours.

228
00:11:18,998 --> 00:11:22,892
She can tell time.
I'm impressed.

229
00:11:22,997 --> 00:11:26,478
The natives are thirsty.
Must feed the natives.

230
00:11:26,582 --> 00:11:29,102
Quench your thirst with a nice shot.

231
00:11:29,206 --> 00:11:31,627
The cleavers have arrived.

232
00:11:31,734 --> 00:11:32,977
And just in time.

233
00:11:33,077 --> 00:11:35,498
Screaming orgasm, June?

234
00:11:35,604 --> 00:11:37,710
I think your mother
may have dropped you

235
00:11:37,813 --> 00:11:39,219
on your head one
too many times, Dan.

236
00:11:39,317 --> 00:11:41,009
She's breast-feeding, you fool.

237
00:11:41,109 --> 00:11:43,247
No shit.
It's just O.J.

238
00:11:43,348 --> 00:11:45,171
Oh, thank you.

239
00:11:45,269 --> 00:11:47,374
Why are you wearing one of those?

240
00:11:51,156 --> 00:11:53,545
To cover my monster boobs.

241
00:11:55,444 --> 00:11:56,971
Monster boobs.

242
00:11:58,964 --> 00:12:00,525
That wasn't very funny.

243
00:12:00,629 --> 00:12:01,556
Yeah, I know.

244
00:12:01,653 --> 00:12:03,376
All right, no, seriously.

245
00:12:03,477 --> 00:12:05,865
I'd first like to thank you all
for coming out here

246
00:12:05,972 --> 00:12:09,485
and accepting my most humble
of invitations after all these years.

247
00:12:09,588 --> 00:12:10,767
I appreciate it.

248
00:12:10,869 --> 00:12:13,169
And I would like
to propose a toast

249
00:12:13,268 --> 00:12:17,326
to our dear friend,
with a great ass, I might add...

250
00:12:17,427 --> 00:12:18,672
Zach.

251
00:12:18,772 --> 00:12:20,299
Happy birthday, old man.

252
00:12:20,403 --> 00:12:22,191
Thank you.

253
00:12:22,291 --> 00:12:24,233
Whoa. Whoa.

254
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:27,373
I dub thee captain for a day.

255
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:30,286
Hang on, hang on.

256
00:12:30,388 --> 00:12:32,754
I'm not done with my toast yet.

257
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:35,698
Here's to staying single,
seeing double,

258
00:12:35,795 --> 00:12:36,656
and sleeping triple.

259
00:12:39,155 --> 00:12:40,169
No disrespect.

260
00:12:40,275 --> 00:12:41,617
None taken?

261
00:12:42,931 --> 00:12:44,207
- Salute!
- Cheers.

262
00:12:44,306 --> 00:12:45,200
Salut.

263
00:12:45,299 --> 00:12:46,925
Salut!

264
00:12:52,337 --> 00:12:54,574
Come on, everybody.
Let's dance.

265
00:12:56,306 --> 00:12:58,314
Baby.

266
00:12:58,419 --> 00:13:02,160
Water's over there.

267
00:13:02,258 --> 00:13:03,435
Let's do it.

268
00:13:03,538 --> 00:13:05,808
Okay.

269
00:13:05,906 --> 00:13:07,848
Very impressive boat, Dan.

270
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:10,671
Yacht, Jimmy.
It's a yacht.

271
00:13:20,882 --> 00:13:23,531
So, you still cruising the world--

272
00:13:23,633 --> 00:13:26,448
Aspen in the winter,
Maui in the summer?

273
00:13:26,545 --> 00:13:29,894
Last winter, Japan.
Yeah. Instructing.

274
00:13:30,002 --> 00:13:30,863
That was fun.

275
00:13:30,961 --> 00:13:32,652
You can snowboard in Japan?

276
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,848
Yeah. Up north. Hokkaido.

277
00:13:36,946 --> 00:13:38,407
Lots of Australians.

278
00:13:38,513 --> 00:13:39,408
Cool.

279
00:13:39,506 --> 00:13:41,066
Man, this is wild.

280
00:13:41,169 --> 00:13:44,300
Ah, careful.
Easy, easy.

281
00:13:44,401 --> 00:13:45,294
You all right?

282
00:13:45,392 --> 00:13:46,953
Relax.

283
00:13:50,674 --> 00:13:52,614
Where are all
the fucking dolphins?

284
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,509
What are you talking about?

285
00:13:54,609 --> 00:13:56,202
Remember Flipper?

286
00:13:56,304 --> 00:13:57,580
Fall in, they'll save you.

287
00:14:00,529 --> 00:14:02,219
Unless you save me first.

288
00:14:08,816 --> 00:14:10,672
Let me guess.
You're the king of the world, right?

289
00:14:10,769 --> 00:14:11,630
Very original.

290
00:14:11,727 --> 00:14:13,833
Zach, shut up.

291
00:14:33,999 --> 00:14:35,941
There it is.

292
00:14:37,487 --> 00:14:40,138
Thanks.

293
00:14:40,239 --> 00:14:41,832
See, that life raft seats 8,

294
00:14:41,935 --> 00:14:44,455
and there are only
6 of us, Amy, so we're set.

295
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:46,347
Don't forget Sarah.

296
00:14:46,447 --> 00:14:48,814
I'm sorry.
So, 6 1/2.

297
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:55,685
Actually, I think the orange
Kind of suits you.

298
00:15:11,918 --> 00:15:13,511
I'm hot.

299
00:15:13,613 --> 00:15:15,719
Yes. You are.

300
00:15:19,503 --> 00:15:21,705
I want to go swimming.

301
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:27,689
You boys want to take a dip?

302
00:15:30,446 --> 00:15:33,162
I got masks and a knife.
Who wants?

303
00:15:33,261 --> 00:15:34,570
- Ooh, yeah.
- We do.

304
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:36,426
We do.

305
00:15:36,525 --> 00:15:38,053
Oh, cute.

306
00:15:38,157 --> 00:15:40,012
Any special requests
for dinner, my captain?

307
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:42,346
Yeah. Two mermaids on a stick.

308
00:15:42,445 --> 00:15:45,195
And now for the piece de resistance.

309
00:15:46,765 --> 00:15:48,521
I love her!

310
00:15:48,621 --> 00:15:49,701
I'm gonna name her Delphine.

311
00:15:49,806 --> 00:15:50,820
Told you we'd see a dolphin.

312
00:15:50,926 --> 00:15:51,786
Oh, wow.

313
00:15:51,885 --> 00:15:53,128
You coming, Dan?

314
00:15:53,228 --> 00:15:54,723
I'll be right with you.

315
00:15:56,204 --> 00:15:57,928
You want one, right?

316
00:15:59,437 --> 00:16:00,330
Duty calls.

317
00:16:00,429 --> 00:16:03,014
Go enjoy yourself, please.

318
00:16:03,116 --> 00:16:04,098
You're sure?

319
00:16:04,204 --> 00:16:05,731
- Fair.
- Mommy.

320
00:16:07,788 --> 00:16:08,683
Gee, thanks.

321
00:16:08,781 --> 00:16:09,708
All right.
Let's get wet.

322
00:16:09,805 --> 00:16:11,527
Should I take my cigarettes with me?

323
00:16:11,627 --> 00:16:13,603
Wow. It looks deep.

324
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:16,775
Just kidding.

325
00:16:16,876 --> 00:16:19,364
That's funny.

326
00:16:19,468 --> 00:16:21,291
I'm coming, sweet girl.

327
00:16:23,435 --> 00:16:24,810
See you ladies in the water.

328
00:16:24,908 --> 00:16:27,428
Last one in is the last one in.

329
00:16:44,395 --> 00:16:46,304
I love it!

330
00:16:48,588 --> 00:16:50,726
Let's go.

331
00:16:50,828 --> 00:16:52,485
You and Amy seem really happy.

332
00:16:52,586 --> 00:16:54,726
We are.

333
00:16:54,827 --> 00:16:57,609
That's nice.

334
00:16:57,707 --> 00:17:00,162
You know what they say...

335
00:17:00,267 --> 00:17:01,695
You gotta kiss a lot of frogs

336
00:17:01,802 --> 00:17:02,730
to find your prince.

337
00:17:04,907 --> 00:17:06,882
I think Amy's still kissing.

338
00:17:06,987 --> 00:17:09,441
Ribbit.

339
00:17:09,547 --> 00:17:10,791
Ribbit.

340
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:16,615
Well, you seem like a very nice frog.

341
00:17:16,714 --> 00:17:18,951
So do you.

342
00:17:20,267 --> 00:17:21,411
I don't mean a frog.

343
00:17:21,514 --> 00:17:24,231
I mean, just pretty good.

344
00:17:24,329 --> 00:17:27,047
I mean, just...

345
00:17:27,146 --> 00:17:29,120
Good. I mean, you're pretty,

346
00:17:29,226 --> 00:17:31,592
- You're good.
- Thank you.

347
00:17:31,689 --> 00:17:32,965
Yeah.

348
00:17:33,066 --> 00:17:35,040
She's beautiful.

349
00:17:35,145 --> 00:17:36,487
Thank you.

350
00:17:36,586 --> 00:17:38,081
I want kids, Amy.

351
00:17:38,186 --> 00:17:39,200
You know...

352
00:17:39,306 --> 00:17:41,378
one day, when the time's right.

353
00:17:41,482 --> 00:17:44,328
With Barbie?

354
00:17:44,424 --> 00:17:46,880
What's wrong with having a little fun?

355
00:17:46,985 --> 00:17:48,196
Nothing.

356
00:17:48,297 --> 00:17:51,363
If I was single and a guy...

357
00:17:51,464 --> 00:17:54,247
You don't need to be
a guy to have fun.

358
00:17:55,944 --> 00:17:57,123
In your dreams.

359
00:17:57,225 --> 00:17:59,844
And to think, if I hadn't been
such an ass in high school,

360
00:17:59,946 --> 00:18:01,253
It could have been
me instead of James.

361
00:18:01,352 --> 00:18:05,029
Yeah. Like I was
the only girl in your life, right?

362
00:18:08,266 --> 00:18:09,672
Why don't we head upstairs?

363
00:18:11,303 --> 00:18:12,798
Why not?

364
00:18:38,344 --> 00:18:39,424
Take that off.

365
00:18:39,528 --> 00:18:40,389
Why?

366
00:18:40,488 --> 00:18:42,081
Just, just come on.
Take it off.

367
00:18:42,183 --> 00:18:43,427
All right.

368
00:18:46,184 --> 00:18:47,842
Okay. Now close your eyes.

369
00:18:47,943 --> 00:18:50,311
- No.
- Come on. Close your eyes.

370
00:18:55,463 --> 00:18:57,984
Okay. Open 'em.

371
00:19:02,182 --> 00:19:03,262
Yeah.

372
00:19:06,503 --> 00:19:07,517
It's cool.

373
00:19:09,704 --> 00:19:11,612
Yeah. Let's go.

374
00:19:11,718 --> 00:19:13,694
Okay.

375
00:19:17,671 --> 00:19:18,881
So that's how it is, huh?

376
00:19:20,423 --> 00:19:24,481
Oh, my gosh.
That's no fair.

377
00:19:24,582 --> 00:19:26,851
It's so stupid and so long ago.

378
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:28,161
I lost my top.

379
00:19:28,263 --> 00:19:29,888
Oh, my God, I feel so exposed.

380
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:31,844
Most people are afraid of spiders

381
00:19:31,942 --> 00:19:34,396
or afraid to fly or scared of...

382
00:19:34,502 --> 00:19:35,909
Scared of clowns?

383
00:19:37,318 --> 00:19:38,398
Stop!

384
00:19:38,502 --> 00:19:39,845
Hey!

385
00:19:43,141 --> 00:19:47,036
Um, it's gotten worse
since I had Sarah.

386
00:19:47,142 --> 00:19:49,597
I don't want her to end up worrying
about stuff like that

387
00:19:49,702 --> 00:19:51,294
because of my paranoia.

388
00:19:51,397 --> 00:19:54,080
You know, my buddy Brad,

389
00:19:54,181 --> 00:19:55,839
He was afraid of circus clowns.

390
00:19:55,941 --> 00:19:57,883
- Was?
- Yep.

391
00:19:57,989 --> 00:19:59,681
What'd he do?

392
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:01,438
Well, we...

393
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:03,036
We took him to the circus.

394
00:20:03,141 --> 00:20:04,635
No! You let me down, Dan!

395
00:20:04,741 --> 00:20:05,689
The water looks great.

396
00:20:05,796 --> 00:20:07,455
Let me down!
Let me down--No!

397
00:20:07,557 --> 00:20:08,898
- No, no, no!
- Amy, trust me.

398
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:44,707
Daddy, what's wrong?

399
00:20:59,107 --> 00:21:02,336
- Marco.
- Polo.

400
00:21:02,434 --> 00:21:03,362
Marco.

401
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:04,953
You're always cheating.

402
00:21:05,059 --> 00:21:07,000
I'm only cheating if you lose.

403
00:21:27,299 --> 00:21:28,640
Daddy!

404
00:21:48,418 --> 00:21:50,011
No!

405
00:21:50,115 --> 00:21:51,423
Daddy!

406
00:21:56,033 --> 00:21:57,276
Amy?

407
00:21:57,377 --> 00:21:59,200
Amy, what the hell happened?

408
00:21:59,298 --> 00:22:00,475
What the hell happened?

409
00:22:00,577 --> 00:22:02,781
How did she get in the water?

410
00:22:02,881 --> 00:22:04,026
Are you okay?

411
00:22:04,129 --> 00:22:05,755
You're gonna be okay, Amy.
We're gonna get you out.

412
00:22:05,857 --> 00:22:07,351
You did this?
Did you do this, Dan?

413
00:22:07,457 --> 00:22:08,318
Are you all right?

414
00:22:08,417 --> 00:22:10,075
We just jumped in the water.

415
00:22:10,178 --> 00:22:11,355
What's wrong with her?

416
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:12,798
Is she gonna be all right?

417
00:22:12,896 --> 00:22:14,391
You're gonna be okay, Amy.
We're gonna get you out.

418
00:22:14,497 --> 00:22:15,991
Where's the ladder?

419
00:22:16,096 --> 00:22:18,039
Where's the ladder?
The ladder?

420
00:22:18,145 --> 00:22:19,672
Should be...

421
00:22:21,248 --> 00:22:23,036
Where's the fucking ladder, Dan?

422
00:22:23,136 --> 00:22:24,860
I think it's on the other side.

423
00:22:26,976 --> 00:22:28,570
It's not on the other side.

424
00:22:28,673 --> 00:22:29,566
Or the back.

425
00:22:29,665 --> 00:22:31,420
There's no fucking ladder.

426
00:22:42,752 --> 00:22:44,061
Get out and help me up.

427
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:47,838
Any second.

428
00:22:47,936 --> 00:22:49,430
We're gonna get you back in the boat.

429
00:22:49,536 --> 00:22:50,398
Real fast.

430
00:22:50,495 --> 00:22:52,318
Relax.

431
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:55,001
We're gonna get back on that boat
real fast, okay?

432
00:23:05,055 --> 00:23:06,396
We gotta find the lowest point.

433
00:23:06,495 --> 00:23:07,423
There!

434
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,014
No?

435
00:23:12,255 --> 00:23:13,498
Fuck!

436
00:23:14,815 --> 00:23:16,341
We gotta get to
the lowest point.

437
00:23:16,447 --> 00:23:17,341
Higher, come on!

438
00:23:17,438 --> 00:23:18,868
# Frere Jacques #

439
00:23:18,975 --> 00:23:20,981
# Dormez-vous? #

440
00:23:21,086 --> 00:23:23,475
- Come on, Zach!
- # Dormez-vous? #

441
00:23:23,583 --> 00:23:25,687
- # Sonnez les matines #
- Hey, let's try--

442
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:26,903
# Sonnez les matines #

443
00:23:27,007 --> 00:23:28,861
- Maybe...
- # Ding, dang, dong #

444
00:23:28,958 --> 00:23:29,755
Zach, what about that?

445
00:23:29,856 --> 00:23:30,748
Damn it!

446
00:23:30,846 --> 00:23:32,307
Zach?

447
00:23:32,414 --> 00:23:33,592
We got a rudder right there
where the line is.

448
00:23:33,695 --> 00:23:34,939
How's that look, Dan?

449
00:23:36,574 --> 00:23:39,292
Fuck!

450
00:23:39,391 --> 00:23:40,796
- It's too high!
- Come on, Dan!

451
00:23:40,893 --> 00:23:43,577
# Dormez-vous? #

452
00:23:43,678 --> 00:23:45,402
# Sonnez les matines #

453
00:23:45,502 --> 00:23:47,258
# Sonnez les matines #

454
00:23:47,358 --> 00:23:51,929
# Ding dang dong,
ding dang dong #

455
00:23:52,029 --> 00:23:53,972
- Hey.
- Hey.

456
00:23:57,694 --> 00:23:58,872
How are you?

457
00:23:59,933 --> 00:24:01,275
Using what? Water?

458
00:24:01,373 --> 00:24:02,867
At least we're trying
to think of something.

459
00:24:02,973 --> 00:24:03,900
I'm thirsty.

460
00:24:05,214 --> 00:24:06,555
I want to get back on.

461
00:24:06,653 --> 00:24:08,825
We'll find a way.

462
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:17,428
Fuck!

463
00:24:17,533 --> 00:24:19,835
Sar--Sarah?

464
00:24:19,933 --> 00:24:21,142
Oh, she'll be fine.

465
00:24:21,244 --> 00:24:23,186
She could sleep
through a hurricane--

466
00:24:23,292 --> 00:24:24,853
And my crappy singing.

467
00:24:26,012 --> 00:24:27,574
You know that.

468
00:24:42,813 --> 00:24:44,056
A little higher!

469
00:24:50,651 --> 00:24:53,269
I want to get out now, Dan!

470
00:24:53,372 --> 00:24:54,779
I'm getting cold.

471
00:24:58,173 --> 00:24:59,514
Dan, help me!

472
00:24:59,612 --> 00:25:00,756
Don't leave me alone.

473
00:25:03,611 --> 00:25:05,586
I'm tired and I'm cold

474
00:25:05,692 --> 00:25:07,830
and I don't want to drown.

475
00:25:07,931 --> 00:25:09,590
Come here.
Come here.

476
00:25:09,693 --> 00:25:11,185
That better?

477
00:25:11,291 --> 00:25:12,535
You all right?

478
00:25:14,492 --> 00:25:15,833
You look pretty silly with that thing.

479
00:25:16,891 --> 00:25:18,615
I--I know.

480
00:25:21,051 --> 00:25:23,255
I'm gonna have to
take it for a bit, okay?

481
00:25:27,771 --> 00:25:28,786
Come on, bro.

482
00:25:28,892 --> 00:25:29,819
Push!

483
00:25:32,667 --> 00:25:34,073
Too fucking slippery, man!

484
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:35,828
I'm holding it the best I can, bro.

485
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:37,108
Do it again.
Come on.

486
00:25:37,211 --> 00:25:38,869
Yes! Yes!

487
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:40,792
Yes! Yes!

488
00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:43,832
The air, bro.
We're losing the air.

489
00:25:43,930 --> 00:25:45,337
Fuck.

490
00:25:58,010 --> 00:26:00,595
This was supposed to be fun.

491
00:26:00,697 --> 00:26:02,126
I'm sorry.

492
00:26:03,609 --> 00:26:05,584
Well, there's a way.

493
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:07,250
There must be.

494
00:26:08,442 --> 00:26:09,903
I don't believe it!

495
00:26:10,009 --> 00:26:11,351
How could you be so stupid?

496
00:26:11,449 --> 00:26:12,910
Would you get off my back?!

497
00:26:13,017 --> 00:26:14,064
I said I was sorry!

498
00:26:14,168 --> 00:26:15,184
Oh, you did?

499
00:26:15,289 --> 00:26:17,111
All right, everybody
just fuckin' relax.

500
00:26:17,209 --> 00:26:19,348
Okay, it can't be this hard.
We'll get on this fucker.

501
00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:20,910
All right?

502
00:26:22,008 --> 00:26:23,503
What you got?

503
00:26:23,609 --> 00:26:24,951
Might be able to grab this.

504
00:26:25,049 --> 00:26:26,456
Hell, yeah, you can reach that!

505
00:26:32,728 --> 00:26:34,223
Gotta time it with the wind.

506
00:26:34,328 --> 00:26:35,735
You're really close.

507
00:26:39,576 --> 00:26:40,688
Yes!

508
00:26:47,128 --> 00:26:47,989
Yes! Nice!

509
00:26:48,088 --> 00:26:49,365
Nice, nice!

510
00:26:49,465 --> 00:26:50,871
Yes, yes, yes!

511
00:26:54,904 --> 00:26:55,831
Damn it!

512
00:26:55,928 --> 00:26:57,172
Damn it!

513
00:27:01,207 --> 00:27:02,767
I don't deserve this.

514
00:27:15,447 --> 00:27:16,790
Fuck it.

515
00:27:16,888 --> 00:27:18,611
We'll think of something.

516
00:27:30,486 --> 00:27:31,665
Hey, girl.

517
00:27:31,767 --> 00:27:34,134
Glad to have you back.

518
00:27:36,726 --> 00:27:39,247
It would be funny
if it weren't so serious, huh?

519
00:27:42,006 --> 00:27:43,021
How's she doing?

520
00:27:43,127 --> 00:27:44,075
She's all right.

521
00:27:44,183 --> 00:27:45,426
Give me your mask.

522
00:27:45,526 --> 00:27:47,665
How are you doing?

523
00:27:47,767 --> 00:27:49,173
Okay, good.

524
00:27:50,485 --> 00:27:52,209
We'll get you out of this water.

525
00:27:58,327 --> 00:28:00,148
Hey.

526
00:28:00,245 --> 00:28:01,739
Any of you guys got a cigarette?

527
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:06,548
Listen, I smoke,
like, 40 packs a day.

528
00:28:06,646 --> 00:28:07,987
My lungs are trash.

529
00:28:08,086 --> 00:28:09,264
You don't see me going under.

530
00:28:09,365 --> 00:28:11,666
Right?

531
00:28:11,765 --> 00:28:14,067
It's a lot harder to
drown than you think.

532
00:28:14,165 --> 00:28:16,304
You'll be okay.

533
00:28:16,405 --> 00:28:18,064
Michelle, we'll be fine.

534
00:28:18,166 --> 00:28:19,409
Thank you.

535
00:28:24,501 --> 00:28:26,389
Come on.

536
00:28:26,486 --> 00:28:27,500
Let's move around a little.

537
00:28:27,605 --> 00:28:28,466
What was that for?

538
00:28:28,564 --> 00:28:29,427
We'll get the blood flowing.

539
00:28:29,525 --> 00:28:30,385
That'll warm us up.

540
00:28:30,484 --> 00:28:31,499
For being here.

541
00:28:31,604 --> 00:28:33,427
We should look
for some other boats.

542
00:28:33,525 --> 00:28:35,499
There must be
some around, right?

543
00:28:35,604 --> 00:28:36,783
Absolutely.

544
00:28:36,886 --> 00:28:37,747
Somebody will find us.

545
00:28:51,923 --> 00:28:53,484
You all right?

546
00:28:56,085 --> 00:28:57,491
Not really.

547
00:28:58,804 --> 00:29:00,364
I'll make it up to you.

548
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:07,442
Something just touched my leg!

549
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:08,969
What the fuck was it?

550
00:29:09,076 --> 00:29:09,937
What?

551
00:29:10,995 --> 00:29:12,403
I don't know.
There it is again!

552
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:13,743
There it is!

553
00:29:13,843 --> 00:29:15,251
A shark!
I know it's a shark!

554
00:29:18,003 --> 00:29:18,866
Okay. Okay.

555
00:29:18,964 --> 00:29:19,824
Just calm down, okay?

556
00:29:53,683 --> 00:29:54,926
What do you see?

557
00:29:57,203 --> 00:29:59,819
Maybe we should
kick our legs--

558
00:29:59,921 --> 00:30:01,416
Scare it away.

559
00:30:01,522 --> 00:30:03,082
Or piss it off!

560
00:30:33,137 --> 00:30:34,828
All right, nobody's bleeding.

561
00:30:34,928 --> 00:30:36,358
It ain't a shark.

562
00:30:37,681 --> 00:30:38,696
How do you know?

563
00:30:38,801 --> 00:30:39,979
We're still here, aren't we?

564
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,738
Yeah, that's the problem, Dan.

565
00:30:41,841 --> 00:30:43,018
I didn't plan for this.

566
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:43,982
No shit.

567
00:30:44,081 --> 00:30:46,797
Don't you do some sort of
pre-flight check, like a pilot--

568
00:30:46,896 --> 00:30:48,620
Have some sort of
emergency backup plans?

569
00:30:48,721 --> 00:30:49,996
Obviously not.

570
00:30:50,096 --> 00:30:51,340
Isn't that standard?

571
00:30:51,441 --> 00:30:52,782
Hey...

572
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,735
Who died and made you
captain fucking Nemo?

573
00:30:54,832 --> 00:30:57,199
You didn't notice either.

574
00:30:57,297 --> 00:30:58,606
None of you did.

575
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,777
It's your boat, Dan,

576
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:03,336
not mine.

577
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:06,058
If it weren't for you, Dan,
Amy would be up there,

578
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:07,502
and we wouldn't
be here right now.

579
00:31:07,601 --> 00:31:09,062
Look...

580
00:31:09,168 --> 00:31:11,502
I said I was sorry, okay?

581
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,258
I should have checked.

582
00:31:13,359 --> 00:31:14,702
I should have checked.

583
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:15,847
I should have checked!

584
00:31:15,951 --> 00:31:17,260
What do you want me to say?

585
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,986
I didn't think.
I made a mistake!

586
00:31:19,088 --> 00:31:21,957
You spend millions on a boat,
but you don't think?

587
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:25,447
I need some space.

588
00:31:25,551 --> 00:31:26,696
Well, that's great!

589
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,774
We got loads of it out here, man!

590
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,537
You're MacGyver.

591
00:31:30,639 --> 00:31:32,613
Why don't you build something?

592
00:31:32,719 --> 00:31:35,403
Yeah. Why not pull
a 747 out of your ass

593
00:31:35,502 --> 00:31:36,680
and fly us all out of here?

594
00:31:44,239 --> 00:31:48,517
There has to be a way,
'cause Sarah's still up there.

595
00:32:09,198 --> 00:32:10,375
I feel cold.

596
00:32:10,477 --> 00:32:12,038
I can't move my legs anymore.

597
00:32:14,477 --> 00:32:16,583
Whoa! Whoa!

598
00:32:16,686 --> 00:32:17,547
Please! Please!

599
00:32:17,645 --> 00:32:18,856
Help!

600
00:32:18,957 --> 00:32:22,535
Listen!

601
00:32:22,637 --> 00:32:23,653
You give me a minute?

602
00:32:23,757 --> 00:32:24,935
I need some time to think.

603
00:32:38,958 --> 00:32:40,299
Jesus!

604
00:32:40,396 --> 00:32:41,411
What are you doing?

605
00:32:41,516 --> 00:32:43,819
Michelle, what are you doing?

606
00:32:43,916 --> 00:32:46,819
I'm just trying to stay afloat!

607
00:32:46,925 --> 00:32:48,419
Why does she get the jacket?

608
00:32:48,525 --> 00:32:49,734
I need it, too!

609
00:32:49,836 --> 00:32:50,697
Stop it!

610
00:32:50,796 --> 00:32:52,225
We can--
We can share it!

611
00:32:52,332 --> 00:32:53,827
Michelle!

612
00:32:53,933 --> 00:32:55,242
Get ahold of yourself!

613
00:32:59,627 --> 00:33:01,570
What is this?

614
00:33:01,676 --> 00:33:03,815
Best friends stick together forever?

615
00:33:07,276 --> 00:33:08,803
I'm a person, too.

616
00:33:15,116 --> 00:33:17,091
I just don't want to die out here!

617
00:33:17,197 --> 00:33:19,170
I don't--I don't want to die!

618
00:33:19,275 --> 00:33:20,453
I don't want to die!

619
00:33:20,556 --> 00:33:22,530
It's okay. It's okay!

620
00:33:22,635 --> 00:33:23,813
It's okay. Come on.

621
00:33:23,915 --> 00:33:25,574
- I can't!
- Come on!

622
00:33:25,676 --> 00:33:27,814
It's fine.
Trust me.

623
00:33:27,916 --> 00:33:29,192
Come on, Michelle.
Trust me.

624
00:33:29,291 --> 00:33:30,697
Okay.

625
00:33:30,795 --> 00:33:32,138
Now breathe.

626
00:33:32,235 --> 00:33:33,096
Breathe with me, okay?

627
00:33:35,115 --> 00:33:36,938
Breathe.

628
00:33:37,036 --> 00:33:38,213
There you go.

629
00:33:38,316 --> 00:33:39,656
There you go, see?

630
00:33:39,755 --> 00:33:41,249
See, you're gonna be fine.

631
00:33:41,355 --> 00:33:42,370
Trust me.

632
00:33:42,474 --> 00:33:44,613
Okay, now, I want
you to breathe, Michelle.

633
00:33:44,715 --> 00:33:46,537
Just breathe.

634
00:33:46,635 --> 00:33:48,042
Breathe with me.

635
00:33:51,275 --> 00:33:52,835
You're gonna be okay.

636
00:33:54,474 --> 00:33:55,719
There you go.

637
00:34:04,074 --> 00:34:05,732
Our father,

638
00:34:05,834 --> 00:34:08,136
Who art in heaven,

639
00:34:08,235 --> 00:34:10,690
Hallowed be thy name...

640
00:34:13,994 --> 00:34:16,711
Thy kingdom come,
thy will be done,

641
00:34:16,810 --> 00:34:19,199
On Earth as it is in Heaven...

642
00:34:23,913 --> 00:34:27,012
Give us this day
our daily bread...

643
00:34:30,473 --> 00:34:33,091
And forgive us our trespasses,

644
00:34:33,193 --> 00:34:36,489
As we forgive those
who trespass against us,

645
00:34:36,585 --> 00:34:39,813
And lead us not
into temptation...

646
00:34:42,473 --> 00:34:44,840
But deliver us from ev--evil.

647
00:34:48,233 --> 00:34:49,640
For thine...

648
00:34:53,353 --> 00:34:54,760
Is the kingdom...

649
00:34:57,194 --> 00:34:58,687
The power...

650
00:35:01,192 --> 00:35:02,752
And the glory.

651
00:35:04,233 --> 00:35:05,639
Amen.

652
00:35:07,272 --> 00:35:09,159
Save your breath, Michelle.

653
00:35:12,553 --> 00:35:14,113
It doesn't hurt to ask.

654
00:35:15,752 --> 00:35:16,613
Yeah.

655
00:35:16,712 --> 00:35:19,494
Blessed are those
who ask for nothing...

656
00:35:19,592 --> 00:35:21,479
For they shall never
be disappointed.

657
00:35:23,752 --> 00:35:24,767
What?

658
00:35:24,872 --> 00:35:26,366
He lets millions of
people die every day.

659
00:35:26,471 --> 00:35:28,130
Children die.

660
00:35:28,232 --> 00:35:29,954
What makes you think
he's gonna save us?

661
00:35:32,391 --> 00:35:33,952
Well, I ain't no saint...

662
00:35:35,272 --> 00:35:37,246
But I'd like to think
that there's something--

663
00:35:37,352 --> 00:35:40,766
Something bigger out there--
I don't know.

664
00:35:40,871 --> 00:35:43,806
Because if there isn't...

665
00:35:43,911 --> 00:35:45,318
we're all fucked.

666
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:49,093
Mothers lift cars off their children

667
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:51,295
when they get into an accident.

668
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:55,109
And people, they cure themselves
of terminal illness.

669
00:35:55,207 --> 00:35:56,668
It happens, okay?

670
00:35:58,151 --> 00:36:00,289
Maybe it can happen to us.

671
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:01,568
It has to happen!

672
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:17,638
I'm so fucking cold!

673
00:36:19,109 --> 00:36:20,997
My hands are totally numb.

674
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:30,848
"Water, water everywhere, and...

675
00:36:30,949 --> 00:36:32,925
not a drop to drink."

676
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:35,168
A 75-foot nautical wet dream.

677
00:36:35,269 --> 00:36:36,764
Shit!

678
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:38,048
Lucky me.

679
00:36:38,149 --> 00:36:40,189
I'm just going to the Bahamas, man!

680
00:36:40,293 --> 00:36:42,202
I'm so thirsty.

681
00:36:42,309 --> 00:36:44,513
Boats are bound
to come by sooner or later.

682
00:36:46,149 --> 00:36:47,873
Somebody will find us.

683
00:37:28,707 --> 00:37:30,595
It's coming from the other side!

684
00:37:47,108 --> 00:37:48,863
That's my phone!

685
00:37:48,962 --> 00:37:50,207
That's my phone!

686
00:37:50,307 --> 00:37:51,386
Get it!

687
00:37:51,491 --> 00:37:52,439
Get it, get it, get it!

688
00:37:52,547 --> 00:37:53,562
Answer it!

689
00:37:53,667 --> 00:37:54,944
Answer the phone!

690
00:37:55,042 --> 00:37:55,904
Careful, don't let it get wet!

691
00:37:56,002 --> 00:37:57,083
- I can reach that.
- Answer it.

692
00:38:01,187 --> 00:38:02,713
Answer the phone!

693
00:38:04,002 --> 00:38:06,872
Answer it!
Answer it!

694
00:38:06,978 --> 00:38:09,433
- Ring, baby!
- Quick!

695
00:38:11,778 --> 00:38:13,240
Erica!

696
00:38:13,346 --> 00:38:14,720
Happy birthday, baby brother.

697
00:38:14,818 --> 00:38:16,761
# For he's a jolly good fellow... #

698
00:38:16,867 --> 00:38:18,045
Erica!

699
00:38:18,146 --> 00:38:19,323
# Which nobody can deny #

700
00:38:19,425 --> 00:38:21,881
Erica? Anybody?
Can you hear us?

701
00:38:21,986 --> 00:38:23,414
Help! We're drowning!
Please!

702
00:38:23,522 --> 00:38:24,384
Shut up!

703
00:38:24,482 --> 00:38:25,562
Erica?

704
00:38:25,666 --> 00:38:26,811
- Zach, can you hear me?
- Erica, hello?

705
00:38:26,914 --> 00:38:28,125
Zach, can you hear me?

706
00:38:28,226 --> 00:38:30,495
Erica! Erica?

707
00:38:31,586 --> 00:38:33,080
- Help us!
- Hello?

708
00:38:33,186 --> 00:38:34,495
What did you do?

709
00:38:34,594 --> 00:38:35,456
Nothing!

710
00:38:35,554 --> 00:38:36,448
You hung up on her!

711
00:38:36,546 --> 00:38:38,203
I did not!

712
00:38:38,304 --> 00:38:41,087
- What happened?
- Give it to me!

713
00:38:41,185 --> 00:38:42,362
Try to call her back.

714
00:38:42,465 --> 00:38:43,578
Bullshit!
Call 9-1-1!

715
00:38:43,682 --> 00:38:45,242
Come on.
Come on.

716
00:38:45,345 --> 00:38:46,840
Please!
God damn it!

717
00:38:46,946 --> 00:38:48,123
Fuck!

718
00:38:48,225 --> 00:38:49,631
No!

719
00:38:53,025 --> 00:38:54,433
Zach.

720
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:02,208
We might have been able to fix it.

721
00:39:04,064 --> 00:39:05,406
It was soaking wet, Dan.

722
00:39:05,505 --> 00:39:06,847
It was fucking fried.

723
00:39:06,945 --> 00:39:08,831
Are you sure about that?

724
00:39:17,024 --> 00:39:18,040
Maybe she heard something.

725
00:39:18,144 --> 00:39:20,184
Heard what? "Hello?"

726
00:39:21,824 --> 00:39:24,126
How's that supposed to help?

727
00:39:24,223 --> 00:39:26,111
You didn't even tell her
where we were!

728
00:39:31,103 --> 00:39:32,664
I'm serious!

729
00:39:36,224 --> 00:39:37,948
We're gonna drown out here.

730
00:39:39,582 --> 00:39:41,077
How come nobody's
listening to me?

731
00:39:41,184 --> 00:39:42,678
We're gonna fucking die out here!

732
00:39:42,783 --> 00:39:43,993
Fucking die, you idiot!

733
00:39:44,096 --> 00:39:45,078
Michelle, shut up!

734
00:39:45,184 --> 00:39:46,526
No, you shut the fuck up!

735
00:39:46,623 --> 00:39:47,671
Hey, come on!

736
00:39:47,775 --> 00:39:49,236
Hey! Hey!

737
00:39:49,343 --> 00:39:50,520
Knock it off!

738
00:39:50,623 --> 00:39:52,282
Let's keep it together!

739
00:39:52,383 --> 00:39:53,332
It's bad enough out here.

740
00:39:53,439 --> 00:39:54,300
We don't need to be

741
00:39:54,399 --> 00:39:55,807
starting in on each
other every second.

742
00:40:12,542 --> 00:40:14,200
Leg cramp!

743
00:40:14,302 --> 00:40:15,164
Which one?

744
00:40:15,263 --> 00:40:16,124
The left.

745
00:40:16,223 --> 00:40:17,880
Hold it up, hold it up.

746
00:40:17,981 --> 00:40:19,956
Okay?

747
00:40:21,982 --> 00:40:23,640
That's better.

748
00:40:23,742 --> 00:40:25,149
Thanks.

749
00:40:47,582 --> 00:40:49,010
I have an idea.

750
00:40:49,116 --> 00:40:50,840
What?

751
00:40:50,941 --> 00:40:52,283
Let's make a rope.

752
00:40:52,381 --> 00:40:53,560
Come on.

753
00:40:53,661 --> 00:40:55,287
Nude up, everybody.

754
00:40:57,342 --> 00:40:58,867
Nude up.

755
00:40:58,973 --> 00:41:00,434
Another one of your perverted stunts?

756
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:02,363
Give me some credit, Lauren.

757
00:41:02,461 --> 00:41:03,802
We make a rope...

758
00:41:03,901 --> 00:41:04,850
out of our shorts.

759
00:41:04,958 --> 00:41:06,037
Toss it up there,

760
00:41:06,141 --> 00:41:08,114
we'll hook it onto something.

761
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:09,562
I hate to say it, but...

762
00:41:09,661 --> 00:41:10,675
It might actually work.

763
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:12,439
Chop chop, people.

764
00:41:12,541 --> 00:41:13,850
I'm just...

765
00:41:13,949 --> 00:41:15,639
I'm so cold.

766
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:17,399
You're wearing dental floss, sweetheart,

767
00:41:17,501 --> 00:41:18,841
not a ski parka.

768
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:20,348
Would you rather drown?

769
00:41:34,236 --> 00:41:35,546
Oh, shit!

770
00:41:38,587 --> 00:41:39,798
Hey!

771
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:45,943
Hey, stop!

772
00:41:46,043 --> 00:41:47,985
Stop!

773
00:41:55,899 --> 00:41:56,914
Over here!

774
00:41:57,019 --> 00:41:58,196
Hey! Stop!

775
00:41:58,298 --> 00:41:59,957
- Oh, god!
- Stop!

776
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:02,198
Stop!

777
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:03,161
No!
Come on!

778
00:42:07,419 --> 00:42:09,719
Stop!

779
00:42:09,818 --> 00:42:12,153
Stop. Please.

780
00:42:20,857 --> 00:42:22,167
She'll be awake soon.

781
00:42:26,395 --> 00:42:27,954
I need the knife.

782
00:42:28,058 --> 00:42:28,919
Okay.

783
00:42:29,017 --> 00:42:30,840
Here, I'll hold that.

784
00:42:30,938 --> 00:42:33,240
- Careful.
- Yeah.

785
00:42:33,338 --> 00:42:34,996
Okay.

786
00:42:35,099 --> 00:42:35,960
Should I start tying?

787
00:42:36,058 --> 00:42:37,303
Yes.

788
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:41,716
Is there any way to
get in from below?

789
00:42:41,818 --> 00:42:43,225
How should I know?

790
00:42:44,699 --> 00:42:45,713
You own a boat like this,

791
00:42:45,818 --> 00:42:46,832
you don't know anything about it?

792
00:42:46,938 --> 00:42:48,114
It's a fucking yacht, Jimmy.

793
00:42:48,218 --> 00:42:49,232
Remember?

794
00:42:49,338 --> 00:42:51,159
If it looks good, I buy it, okay?

795
00:42:51,257 --> 00:42:52,600
Is that the answer you're looking for?

796
00:42:52,698 --> 00:42:54,258
'Cause it's the only one I got right now.

797
00:42:57,018 --> 00:42:58,577
I need the mask.

798
00:43:02,297 --> 00:43:03,704
Thanks.

799
00:43:11,897 --> 00:43:12,758
Hey, Zach.

800
00:43:12,857 --> 00:43:15,312
You done with the knife?

801
00:43:15,418 --> 00:43:17,718
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

802
00:43:17,816 --> 00:43:19,311
Let's tie this.

803
00:43:19,416 --> 00:43:20,310
Tie it here.

804
00:43:20,409 --> 00:43:21,870
Yeah.
It looks good.

805
00:43:21,976 --> 00:43:23,319
Hello.

806
00:43:23,417 --> 00:43:25,555
I am James Cousteau,

807
00:43:25,657 --> 00:43:26,835
explorer of the deep.

808
00:43:26,938 --> 00:43:28,114
Is it a good knot?

809
00:43:28,216 --> 00:43:29,393
You gotta make sure
it's a good knot.

810
00:43:29,496 --> 00:43:30,511
I'm gonna go take
a peek below.

811
00:43:30,617 --> 00:43:32,111
Is it strong?

812
00:43:32,216 --> 00:43:33,394
It's gotta be able to hold me.

813
00:43:33,496 --> 00:43:34,358
You all right?

814
00:43:34,457 --> 00:43:36,279
I'll be fine.

815
00:43:37,496 --> 00:43:39,471
Give me the bikini top.

816
00:43:42,456 --> 00:43:44,757
Tie knots--If you can.

817
00:43:44,856 --> 00:43:46,383
I may have dropped something.

818
00:43:46,489 --> 00:43:48,495
This is strong.

819
00:44:19,127 --> 00:44:20,436
Wring it out.

820
00:44:20,535 --> 00:44:23,502
We have to wring it--Yeah.

821
00:44:23,606 --> 00:44:25,396
Go to your left.

822
00:44:27,414 --> 00:44:28,756
Back me up.

823
00:44:28,854 --> 00:44:29,869
You okay?

824
00:44:29,974 --> 00:44:30,835
Wait--wait--

825
00:44:30,934 --> 00:44:31,796
Here, pass it to Lauren.

826
00:44:31,895 --> 00:44:32,909
Lauren?

827
00:44:33,015 --> 00:44:34,029
Someone hold it here.

828
00:44:34,135 --> 00:44:35,476
I got it.

829
00:44:35,574 --> 00:44:36,589
Thank you so much.

830
00:44:36,695 --> 00:44:37,871
Wait--Wait.

831
00:44:37,974 --> 00:44:40,430
Oh, that's it.
One--

832
00:44:41,973 --> 00:44:44,341
Two, three!

833
00:44:48,214 --> 00:44:49,555
Give me a "one, two, three."

834
00:44:49,653 --> 00:44:50,514
Okay.

835
00:44:50,613 --> 00:44:51,791
Just a straight "one, two, three."

836
00:44:51,894 --> 00:44:53,868
Okay.

837
00:44:53,974 --> 00:44:54,836
Fuck!

838
00:44:54,934 --> 00:44:55,949
Here, wring it out a little.

839
00:44:56,054 --> 00:44:58,028
Wring it out.

840
00:44:58,133 --> 00:44:59,475
You're getting this too wet.

841
00:44:59,573 --> 00:45:00,817
It's too wet, look.

842
00:45:09,847 --> 00:45:11,670
It seems so easy.

843
00:45:11,768 --> 00:45:13,262
Okay, you can do it.

844
00:45:13,367 --> 00:45:14,710
On three.
You can do it, Zach.

845
00:45:14,809 --> 00:45:15,986
One--

846
00:45:16,088 --> 00:45:17,102
To the left a little.

847
00:45:17,208 --> 00:45:18,069
Come on, come on.

848
00:45:18,168 --> 00:45:21,233
One, two, three.

849
00:45:23,927 --> 00:45:25,171
Yeah!

850
00:45:43,926 --> 00:45:46,382
You can do it.
You can do it.

851
00:45:46,488 --> 00:45:47,631
Come on, Zach.

852
00:45:47,734 --> 00:45:49,426
You can get it, man.

853
00:45:49,526 --> 00:45:51,249
Take it slow.

854
00:45:58,006 --> 00:45:59,566
Careful...

855
00:46:17,206 --> 00:46:18,700
Son of a bitch!

856
00:46:18,805 --> 00:46:20,399
- Yes!
- Yes, yes, yes!

857
00:46:20,501 --> 00:46:22,257
Oh, my God!

858
00:46:42,036 --> 00:46:42,898
God damn it.

859
00:46:48,885 --> 00:46:50,543
Yo, man.

860
00:46:50,645 --> 00:46:52,467
What's that?

861
00:46:52,565 --> 00:46:54,540
I don't know.

862
00:46:54,646 --> 00:46:57,230
There's a square cut in the side
of your boat, bro.

863
00:46:57,331 --> 00:46:59,699
James!

864
00:47:28,723 --> 00:47:31,178
What happened? Wh--

865
00:47:31,283 --> 00:47:32,145
What are you--

866
00:47:32,243 --> 00:47:34,065
Are you all right?

867
00:47:34,163 --> 00:47:35,657
Lauren!

868
00:47:37,523 --> 00:47:39,825
Lauren!
What happened?

869
00:47:43,443 --> 00:47:44,621
James.

870
00:47:44,723 --> 00:47:47,340
Hey, James--
Lauren?

871
00:47:47,443 --> 00:47:48,937
Is he okay? James?

872
00:47:49,043 --> 00:47:50,057
Is he okay?

873
00:47:50,163 --> 00:47:52,618
- James?
- What happened?

874
00:47:52,723 --> 00:47:54,381
Support his head.

875
00:47:54,482 --> 00:47:55,344
What happened?

876
00:47:55,443 --> 00:47:57,100
Support his head.

877
00:47:57,202 --> 00:47:58,281
Keep it supported.

878
00:48:02,963 --> 00:48:06,507
I think he has a skull fracture.

879
00:48:06,611 --> 00:48:07,504
Jesus Christ.

880
00:48:07,602 --> 00:48:11,018
He needs a hospital
and he needs it fast.

881
00:48:11,122 --> 00:48:13,129
Enough of this bullshit.

882
00:48:13,234 --> 00:48:15,023
James!
James.

883
00:48:15,123 --> 00:48:16,367
Give me the knife.

884
00:48:32,146 --> 00:48:33,608
No!

885
00:48:37,393 --> 00:48:39,335
Dan! What is wrong with you?

886
00:48:39,441 --> 00:48:40,651
No!

887
00:48:40,752 --> 00:48:42,542
Buy yourself a new toy
when we're out of this mess!

888
00:48:42,641 --> 00:48:43,656
What the hell are you doing?

889
00:48:53,713 --> 00:48:55,055
No!

890
00:49:07,695 --> 00:49:08,940
Oh, my God!

891
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:12,139
Couldn't you just leave him alone?

892
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:15,975
Give me some of the rope.

893
00:49:16,081 --> 00:49:16,941
God damn it, Dan, now!

894
00:49:17,039 --> 00:49:19,112
Christ, I'm--I'm sorry--

895
00:49:19,215 --> 00:49:20,296
What did you do?

896
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:21,415
It's just a stupid fucking boat!

897
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:22,927
What's wrong with you?

898
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:28,687
This is gonna attract
everything, isn't it?

899
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:41,832
He was just trying
to get us out of here.

900
00:49:48,558 --> 00:49:50,217
Sarah...

901
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:51,978
Sarah, I'm here!

902
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:54,731
Mommy and daddy are here!

903
00:49:54,831 --> 00:49:56,772
Sarah!

904
00:49:56,878 --> 00:49:57,739
I'm here!

905
00:49:57,838 --> 00:50:00,653
Mommy and daddy
are here! I--

906
00:50:04,655 --> 00:50:06,062
I'm sorry.

907
00:50:08,238 --> 00:50:09,252
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

908
00:50:09,359 --> 00:50:10,984
Easiest thing in the world.

909
00:50:11,087 --> 00:50:12,679
It means nothing!

910
00:50:13,999 --> 00:50:15,406
Where's Michelle?

911
00:50:16,717 --> 00:50:19,019
Michelle!

912
00:50:24,751 --> 00:50:25,961
Oh, my God.

913
00:50:28,878 --> 00:50:29,739
Michelle.

914
00:52:29,354 --> 00:52:30,760
How you doing?

915
00:52:36,234 --> 00:52:38,121
I feel cold.

916
00:52:44,202 --> 00:52:46,111
Well, we are at sea.

917
00:52:48,873 --> 00:52:50,433
Hold your head up, babe.

918
00:53:01,994 --> 00:53:03,171
It's fine.

919
00:53:03,274 --> 00:53:05,892
Maybe 20 years from now...

920
00:53:05,994 --> 00:53:08,196
we'll look back on this and laugh.

921
00:53:22,952 --> 00:53:24,774
It's too bad...

922
00:53:24,872 --> 00:53:27,654
that Dan forgot his camera.

923
00:53:27,751 --> 00:53:29,159
His video camera.

924
00:53:31,592 --> 00:53:32,999
Yeah.

925
00:53:34,632 --> 00:53:37,893
Remember--
El Matador beach?

926
00:53:37,991 --> 00:53:40,512
Of course.

927
00:53:40,616 --> 00:53:42,371
You were so--

928
00:53:42,472 --> 00:53:44,196
So sexy that day.

929
00:53:49,831 --> 00:53:51,718
Now I know you're delirious.

930
00:53:54,631 --> 00:53:57,052
How much seawater did you drink?

931
00:54:01,351 --> 00:54:03,555
I should've told you that then.

932
00:54:06,950 --> 00:54:11,708
You can tell me
when we get back to shore, okay?

933
00:54:13,319 --> 00:54:14,267
Okay?

934
00:54:17,190 --> 00:54:18,597
Okay.

935
00:54:25,511 --> 00:54:26,917
Zach?

936
00:54:31,910 --> 00:54:33,404
Zach, breathe!

937
00:54:33,510 --> 00:54:35,005
Zach, wake up!

938
00:54:35,111 --> 00:54:36,898
Help me, Amy!

939
00:54:36,998 --> 00:54:38,853
Zach, breathe!
Breathe!

940
00:54:38,950 --> 00:54:41,568
Wake up!
Breathe!

941
00:54:41,669 --> 00:54:42,717
Oh, no!

942
00:54:46,469 --> 00:54:48,192
No!

943
00:54:49,189 --> 00:54:51,011
God damn it!

944
00:54:51,109 --> 00:54:52,418
No!

945
00:54:57,957 --> 00:55:01,471
Is the boat worth more to you
than your friends?

946
00:55:03,589 --> 00:55:05,248
He's dead!

947
00:55:05,349 --> 00:55:07,006
Zach's dead!

948
00:55:07,109 --> 00:55:08,385
Michelle's dead!

949
00:55:08,484 --> 00:55:10,851
But you still got your boat, right?

950
00:55:10,949 --> 00:55:12,673
Oh, yeah, I'm sorry.

951
00:55:12,773 --> 00:55:14,049
It's a yacht!

952
00:55:14,149 --> 00:55:15,806
It's a fucking yacht, isn't it?

953
00:55:15,907 --> 00:55:16,923
No!

954
00:55:17,028 --> 00:55:19,003
It's a fucking yacht!

955
00:55:19,108 --> 00:55:20,287
It's a fucking yacht!

956
00:55:20,389 --> 00:55:21,404
Fucking yacht!

957
00:55:21,509 --> 00:55:23,647
Stop it!

958
00:55:26,148 --> 00:55:27,807
You're on his side.

959
00:55:27,909 --> 00:55:29,730
No, no!
Of course not.

960
00:55:29,828 --> 00:55:32,033
That's what it looks like to me.

961
00:55:32,132 --> 00:55:33,561
After everything he's done?

962
00:55:35,972 --> 00:55:39,135
Old fires always burn, right?

963
00:55:39,236 --> 00:55:41,146
James--I'm just--

964
00:55:41,252 --> 00:55:43,391
I'm just worried about you.

965
00:55:56,707 --> 00:55:59,490
Most likely to succeed.

966
00:56:06,307 --> 00:56:08,576
I was voted "most likely to succeed"
our senior year.

967
00:56:08,675 --> 00:56:09,470
You guys remember that?

968
00:56:09,570 --> 00:56:13,564
Dan...

969
00:56:13,666 --> 00:56:16,601
I didn't want Zach to hurt it, I--

970
00:56:16,706 --> 00:56:18,910
I couldn't let him hurt it because--

971
00:56:22,467 --> 00:56:24,506
Because it isn't mine.

972
00:56:26,306 --> 00:56:27,680
The boat--

973
00:56:29,187 --> 00:56:30,528
This isn't--This isn't my boat,

974
00:56:30,627 --> 00:56:33,245
This isn't my life.

975
00:56:33,347 --> 00:56:35,485
I couldn't--

976
00:56:35,586 --> 00:56:38,106
I couldn't rent something like this,
let alone buy it.

977
00:56:38,209 --> 00:56:39,638
What?

978
00:56:39,746 --> 00:56:42,615
I don't--I don't invest anything
for anybody.

979
00:56:44,066 --> 00:56:46,040
I'm a fraud.
I'm a--

980
00:56:46,145 --> 00:56:47,322
I'm a monkey in a mailroom.

981
00:56:47,425 --> 00:56:49,498
I'm an errand boy.
I'm nothing.

982
00:56:52,546 --> 00:56:55,263
I told Michelle I was a millionaire.

983
00:56:55,362 --> 00:56:58,590
I told a hundred Michelles
the same thing.

984
00:57:00,386 --> 00:57:03,648
I walk into their bars
in my $2,000 suit

985
00:57:03,746 --> 00:57:06,679
with a picture of my boss' yacht
in my pocket, and I--

986
00:57:06,785 --> 00:57:10,679
I promise to sail
them around the world,

987
00:57:10,785 --> 00:57:12,444
and they always believe me.

988
00:57:12,545 --> 00:57:14,367
You believed me.

989
00:57:14,465 --> 00:57:18,010
And for once, just once...

990
00:57:18,113 --> 00:57:20,350
I wanted to believe it myself.

991
00:57:22,624 --> 00:57:26,584
I--I'm--I'm so sorry.

992
00:57:29,664 --> 00:57:32,185
No!

993
00:57:33,792 --> 00:57:35,963
Jesus Christ, I killed him.

994
00:57:42,784 --> 00:57:44,344
I killed them.

995
00:57:50,304 --> 00:57:52,028
Oh, God,
it's all my fault.

996
00:58:10,943 --> 00:58:14,260
I loved him
and I never got to tell him.

997
00:58:14,367 --> 00:58:16,603
He knew.
He knew.

998
00:58:16,703 --> 00:58:17,564
Let him go.

999
00:58:17,663 --> 00:58:19,637
No, no!

1000
00:58:19,742 --> 00:58:22,045
Okay.

1001
00:58:22,143 --> 00:58:23,190
Okay.

1002
00:58:27,262 --> 00:58:29,150
God, no!

1003
00:59:22,941 --> 00:59:26,137
Guys, do you think we're going to
know each other forever?

1004
00:59:49,341 --> 00:59:52,122
Is Sarah still asleep?

1005
00:59:52,220 --> 00:59:53,781
I think so.

1006
00:59:57,947 --> 00:59:59,954
She'll be getting up
pretty soon, won't she?

1007
01:00:00,059 --> 01:00:01,554
Probably.

1008
01:00:01,660 --> 01:00:03,798
We'll be back
on board by then.

1009
01:00:12,316 --> 01:00:15,162
I'll check
on her before I go to bed.

1010
01:00:15,259 --> 01:00:16,820
Okay.

1011
01:00:20,699 --> 01:00:22,292
She's a good girl, isn't she?

1012
01:00:24,860 --> 01:00:26,200
Just like her mom.

1013
01:01:09,818 --> 01:01:11,159
I think I'm gonna--

1014
01:01:11,257 --> 01:01:13,778
I'm gonna go for a little...swim.

1015
01:01:16,216 --> 01:01:18,192
To see if I can
make it back to shore.

1016
01:01:18,297 --> 01:01:20,271
It's too far.

1017
01:01:20,377 --> 01:01:22,003
Maybe it is, maybe it isn't.

1018
01:01:25,177 --> 01:01:27,315
I'm not gonna die
treading water, man.

1019
01:01:27,416 --> 01:01:28,824
That's just not me.

1020
01:01:30,617 --> 01:01:32,143
It's James, he's just--

1021
01:01:32,250 --> 01:01:34,671
There's pressure on his brain, Amy.

1022
01:01:34,777 --> 01:01:36,021
Just--

1023
01:01:45,976 --> 01:01:47,285
See you soon.

1024
01:02:11,096 --> 01:02:12,110
You're gonna make it.

1025
01:02:12,216 --> 01:02:14,834
Yeah, so are you.

1026
01:02:14,935 --> 01:02:16,975
- Okay.
- Take care, okay?

1027
01:02:21,975 --> 01:02:24,397
You look after them
while I'm gone, yeah?

1028
01:02:24,504 --> 01:02:25,615
Yes, ma'am.

1029
01:02:28,215 --> 01:02:29,776
Wish me luck then.

1030
01:02:31,255 --> 01:02:32,815
You won't need it.

1031
01:03:14,773 --> 01:03:16,181
Sarah!

1032
01:03:18,453 --> 01:03:19,402
Baby girl!

1033
01:03:21,334 --> 01:03:22,926
Sarah--

1034
01:03:23,029 --> 01:03:24,339
Can you hear me?
I'm here.

1035
01:03:26,932 --> 01:03:28,689
Your mommy's here,
I--can you hear me?

1036
01:03:31,317 --> 01:03:34,034
Please stop crying,
you hear me?

1037
01:03:36,372 --> 01:03:38,259
I'm here, I just--I can't--

1038
01:03:49,332 --> 01:03:52,748
I thought I heard
Sarah crying.

1039
01:03:56,852 --> 01:04:00,267
She's hungry.

1040
01:04:01,492 --> 01:04:02,507
How are you--

1041
01:04:02,613 --> 01:04:03,856
How are you doing?

1042
01:04:06,740 --> 01:04:09,292
I'm all right.

1043
01:04:12,212 --> 01:04:13,259
Dan?

1044
01:04:16,211 --> 01:04:18,252
I can't move my legs anymore.

1045
01:04:29,075 --> 01:04:31,792
The square cut on
the side of your boat.

1046
01:04:31,891 --> 01:04:34,444
He was just
trying to get us out of here.

1047
01:04:48,210 --> 01:04:49,225
What are you doing?

1048
01:04:49,330 --> 01:04:51,786
I--I want--

1049
01:04:51,891 --> 01:04:54,257
Try to find the knife.

1050
01:04:57,330 --> 01:04:58,672
Do you know how far we've drifted?

1051
01:04:58,769 --> 01:05:01,552
I got--I gotta do something.

1052
01:05:01,650 --> 01:05:03,625
No.

1053
01:05:03,731 --> 01:05:05,933
You don't. I do.

1054
01:05:08,690 --> 01:05:10,097
I'll find it.

1055
01:05:12,690 --> 01:05:14,511
Okay.

1056
01:06:03,248 --> 01:06:05,386
James.

1057
01:06:15,887 --> 01:06:17,448
I feel tired.

1058
01:06:21,648 --> 01:06:23,371
Really tired.

1059
01:06:27,728 --> 01:06:29,800
My head hurts.

1060
01:06:41,327 --> 01:06:43,694
I think I'm gonna
go to bed, all right?

1061
01:06:48,046 --> 01:06:49,933
Don't go to sleep yet.

1062
01:06:52,047 --> 01:06:54,249
You wait up for me, okay?

1063
01:06:55,502 --> 01:06:56,964
You stay awake.

1064
01:06:58,927 --> 01:07:00,104
Sure.

1065
01:07:00,207 --> 01:07:01,134
Okay.

1066
01:07:01,230 --> 01:07:03,751
Pretty sure...

1067
01:07:05,645 --> 01:07:07,621
I'll wait up for you any day.

1068
01:07:07,726 --> 01:07:08,806
Okay.

1069
01:07:15,885 --> 01:07:18,024
Yeah.

1070
01:07:18,126 --> 01:07:19,140
Yeah.

1071
01:07:38,765 --> 01:07:40,489
Don't cry.

1072
01:07:41,965 --> 01:07:43,688
I'm sorry.

1073
01:07:48,685 --> 01:07:50,986
Don't cry.

1074
01:07:51,085 --> 01:07:52,809
It's okay.

1075
01:08:30,924 --> 01:08:32,582
James!

1076
01:08:33,962 --> 01:08:35,457
Drink.

1077
01:08:35,563 --> 01:08:36,969
It's raining.

1078
01:08:38,763 --> 01:08:39,843
James.

1079
01:10:13,160 --> 01:10:17,022
It's okay.
It's okay.

1080
01:10:17,127 --> 01:10:18,470
# Frere Jacques #

1081
01:10:18,568 --> 01:10:20,390
# Frere Jacques #

1082
01:10:21,641 --> 01:10:23,047
# Dormez-vous? #

1083
01:10:23,144 --> 01:10:25,085
# Dormez-vous? #

1084
01:10:25,191 --> 01:10:26,686
# Sonnez les matines #

1085
01:10:26,792 --> 01:10:28,766
# Sonnez les matines #

1086
01:10:41,640 --> 01:10:43,581
Sarah and I, we're gonna--

1087
01:10:43,687 --> 01:10:46,786
We're gonna miss you so much.

1088

# Frere Jacques #

1089

1091
01:10:55,334 --> 01:10:56,829
# Dormez-vous? #

1092
01:12:16,163 --> 01:12:17,441
Grab it!

1093
01:13:10,435 --> 01:13:12,475
It should have been me!

1094
01:13:19,874 --> 01:13:21,915
It should have been me!

1095
01:13:26,914 --> 01:13:28,158
Hey.

1096
01:14:06,337 --> 01:14:07,996
Amy!

1097
01:14:19,232 --> 01:14:20,639
Climb up!

1098
01:14:25,024 --> 01:14:27,512
Climb up!

1099
01:14:37,471 --> 01:14:38,813
Try it again!

1100
01:14:38,912 --> 01:14:40,188
Come on!
You can do it!

1101
01:16:18,108 --> 01:16:19,189
Sarah!

1102
01:16:51,708 --> 01:16:53,268
Oh, Sarah!

1103
01:16:55,387 --> 01:16:56,565
I know! I'm sorry!

1104
01:16:56,667 --> 01:16:58,325
I'm sorry
I left you alone.

1105
01:16:58,428 --> 01:17:00,402
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to!

1106
01:17:00,508 --> 01:17:01,522
I didn't--

1107
01:17:03,067 --> 01:17:04,562
It's fine.

1108
01:17:04,667 --> 01:17:05,682
It's gonna be fine.

1109
01:17:05,787 --> 01:17:08,023
Gonna be fine.

1110
01:17:14,106 --> 01:17:15,929
It's okay.
