1
00:00:17,292 --> 00:00:19,317
Snots, kill.

2
00:00:19,761 --> 00:00:21,126
Kill!

3
00:00:21,296 --> 00:00:24,060
Kill! Where you going, Snots?
Come back here!

4
00:00:50,192 --> 00:00:52,353
It is not a Christmas tree.

5
00:00:52,894 --> 00:00:56,159
- But it'll do.
- It'll have to.

6
00:00:57,366 --> 00:01:01,325
You know, we used to have a big tree
every Christmas when I was a kid.

7
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:05,197
My father would take hours to pick it out.

8
00:01:05,474 --> 00:01:09,877
He sometimes would do everything
but x-ray it. Then he'd turn to us and say:

9
00:01:10,045 --> 00:01:15,381
"You are looking at the best Christmas tree
in Kansas City. No, in the world."

10
00:01:18,954 --> 00:01:20,922
Christmas with Daddy.

11
00:01:21,256 --> 00:01:24,282
Guess dads are all like that
at Christmas.

12
00:01:24,726 --> 00:01:26,523
Even Eddie.

13
00:01:43,879 --> 00:01:47,576
That's a good piggy, that's a good piggy.

14
00:02:25,654 --> 00:02:27,645
It's so beautiful here.

15
00:02:27,823 --> 00:02:30,917
Yeah. If only it had a shopping mall.

16
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:35,920
- The house is coming along great.
- Yeah, it's a great Christmas gift.

17
00:02:36,465 --> 00:02:37,762
Look at him.

18
00:02:37,933 --> 00:02:39,560
It's a funny thing, you know.

19
00:02:39,735 --> 00:02:43,432
Here we are in serious trouble
and I've never seen Eddie so happy.

20
00:02:43,605 --> 00:02:47,974
Sometimes a crisis brings out the best
in a person. I mean, he's even working.

21
00:02:54,316 --> 00:02:57,877
Hey, Dad? Dad? Dad!

22
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:00,313
There's something I've got to tell you.

23
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:02,045
It's your girlfriend.

24
00:03:02,224 --> 00:03:04,124
- Is she pregnant?
- No!

25
00:03:09,664 --> 00:03:11,393
It's just that...

26
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:13,329
I always thought that...

27
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:16,196
...you were kind of...

28
00:03:16,471 --> 00:03:17,733
...sort of...

29
00:03:19,207 --> 00:03:21,334
- Gay?
- No.

30
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:24,707
Just... The bottom of the food chain.

31
00:03:26,481 --> 00:03:28,210
Well, I was wrong.

32
00:03:28,383 --> 00:03:31,875
I mean, you know,
like, you never worked much.

33
00:03:34,222 --> 00:03:37,555
Mom took care of the kids
and cooked and cleaned...

34
00:03:37,726 --> 00:03:39,921
...worked three jobs.

35
00:03:40,095 --> 00:03:45,863
And then, you know, the bank foreclosed on
the house and the repo people took the RV.

36
00:03:48,136 --> 00:03:50,161
I loved that RV.

37
00:03:52,407 --> 00:03:54,841
That RV!

38
00:03:55,811 --> 00:03:59,042
And here we are on a desert island,
who knows where...

39
00:03:59,214 --> 00:04:02,775
...and he goes out and kills
with his bare hands to feed his family.

40
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:07,547
I mean, can you imagine him taking on that
huge animal and beating him in a fair fight?

41
00:04:07,722 --> 00:04:13,354
I know. I mean, God, he was like a caveman
or a gladiator or something.

42
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:15,562
Yeah.

43
00:04:19,835 --> 00:04:23,669
Well, anyway, I was wrong.

44
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:28,674
No, you were right. I'm just no good.

45
00:04:29,277 --> 00:04:31,745
Right. You know, normally.

46
00:04:31,913 --> 00:04:35,144
But here, on this island...

47
00:04:36,251 --> 00:04:37,809
...you've been great.

48
00:04:41,389 --> 00:04:43,220
Do you mean that?

49
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:45,721
Yeah.

50
00:04:46,261 --> 00:04:47,558
Boy...

51
00:04:47,729 --> 00:04:50,129
...you don't know how good
that makes me feel.

52
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,797
From now on...

53
00:04:54,436 --> 00:04:58,532
...I’ve got no place to go but up!

54
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:08,305
<i>Hi, it's Audrey Griswold.</i>
<i>Leave a message and merry Christmas.</i>

55
00:05:10,185 --> 00:05:15,350
<i>Ever Ready Plumbing here. We'll have a</i>
<i>man out to your house within 30 days.</i>

56
00:05:15,524 --> 00:05:17,458
<i>Merry Christmas.</i>

57
00:05:23,331 --> 00:05:26,926
Merry Christmas morning, everybody!

58
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:41,106
Merry Christmas morning!

59
00:05:42,784 --> 00:05:45,514
- Yeah!
- Come here, you. Merry Christmas!

60
00:05:45,687 --> 00:05:47,518
Merry Christmas!

61
00:05:49,524 --> 00:05:50,957
Merry Christmas, Milwaukee.

62
00:05:51,393 --> 00:05:52,826
Here's...

63
00:05:52,994 --> 00:05:54,894
...Mr. Christmas himself.

64
00:05:55,163 --> 00:05:57,222
It's Saint Nick.

65
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:08,173
Merry Christmas, Audrey,
this is from Eddie.

66
00:06:08,343 --> 00:06:12,837
Eddie, this is great. Lipstick!
It's my favorite color.

67
00:06:13,014 --> 00:06:15,744
- Where did you get it?
- Found it in your purse.

68
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:20,179
This is from Third.

69
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:24,016
Third, my gosh, look at that!

70
00:06:24,192 --> 00:06:27,423
That's a deluxe spear.

71
00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:30,156
It's an aerodynamically correct spear, Dad.

72
00:06:30,332 --> 00:06:33,733
See those fins?
Those are for throwing accurately.

73
00:06:33,902 --> 00:06:35,893
Looks like a one-way street sign.

74
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:40,302
Well, let's take it for a little test drive,
shall we?

75
00:06:47,983 --> 00:06:51,885
Okay, now let's sing
a few Christmas songs.

76
00:06:55,557 --> 00:06:56,956
Let's see.

77
00:07:42,937 --> 00:07:45,963
Hey, I got another surprise for us here.

78
00:07:46,141 --> 00:07:51,101
A homemade concoction that
my dad used to make.

79
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:54,043
Only, he had a still
and sold it to the neighbors...

80
00:07:54,215 --> 00:07:57,912
...but it kept us going through
the lean times, until he got caught...

81
00:07:58,086 --> 00:08:00,680
...and wound up doing 3 to 5.
But here's a taste.

82
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:03,255
All right. Well, here goes.

83
00:08:07,662 --> 00:08:09,823
That's got a kick. What is in that?

84
00:08:09,998 --> 00:08:13,661
Well, it's got three parts coconut milk,
two parts bug juice...

85
00:08:13,835 --> 00:08:17,828
...six parts bourbon, a little banana peel
for texture and a Tootsie Roll.

86
00:08:18,006 --> 00:08:19,667
Oh, and some sunscreen.

87
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:31,007
Lord, I wanna thank you for keeping us
healthy and, particularly, alive...

88
00:08:31,186 --> 00:08:34,155
...during this whole shipwreck deal.

89
00:08:34,322 --> 00:08:37,689
But most of all, Lord,
I wanna thank you for this house.

90
00:08:37,859 --> 00:08:40,828
Oh, it's a good house, Lord.

91
00:08:40,995 --> 00:08:46,991
It's probably the first house we ever had
where we didn't owe a mortgage or taxes.

92
00:08:47,168 --> 00:08:51,832
And maybe the only house we'll ever have
where the bank won't foreclose on it.

93
00:08:52,006 --> 00:08:56,909
Oh, it's not as nice as Audrey's house,
but it's a fine house, Lord.

94
00:08:57,078 --> 00:09:01,310
And I want you to please
just find it to forgive me, Lord...

95
00:09:01,483 --> 00:09:07,422
...for losing the RV
and the dirt farm, Lord.

96
00:09:07,655 --> 00:09:11,147
- We are sin, Lord..!
- Can I say something?

97
00:09:13,461 --> 00:09:15,258
Excuse me, Lord.

98
00:09:17,799 --> 00:09:19,391
Yeah?

99
00:09:19,968 --> 00:09:21,265
What's in the coconut?

100
00:09:22,337 --> 00:09:24,134
Another tropical surprise.

101
00:09:24,305 --> 00:09:28,264
Can we drink the surprise first
and then bust the coconut?

102
00:09:28,843 --> 00:09:32,176
- No.
- Well, there you have it.

103
00:09:32,347 --> 00:09:38,343
Anyway, Lord, be it ever so humble,
there's no place like this here house.

104
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:40,811
Amen.

105
00:10:01,376 --> 00:10:05,244
- Merry Christmas!
- Oh, merry Christmas to you!

106
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,615
Eddie!

107
00:10:16,257 --> 00:10:18,953
Put me down, put me down,
put me down!

108
00:10:20,562 --> 00:10:21,824
You did it, Dad!

109
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:24,624
You killed a boar
and built our own damn house!

110
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:27,324
Watch your mouth, Third.

111
00:10:53,928 --> 00:10:57,557
Well, we've learned
something here today.

112
00:10:57,765 --> 00:11:00,825
We definitely have to make it
more secure.

113
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:04,104
Let's eat.

114
00:11:30,365 --> 00:11:31,957
<i>Eddie.</i>

115
00:11:32,133 --> 00:11:37,264
<i>Eddie, you're so brave.</i>
<i>And you have a good sense of humor.</i>

116
00:11:37,438 --> 00:11:42,808
<i>You're my hero...</i>

117
00:13:04,359 --> 00:13:08,489
It's a plane! A plane!
And he sees us!

118
00:13:08,663 --> 00:13:12,463
It's Jack, it's Melbourne Jack Malpey!

119
00:13:13,935 --> 00:13:15,459
We're saved!

120
00:13:17,372 --> 00:13:18,600
- Over here!
- Uncle Nick!

121
00:13:18,773 --> 00:13:22,834
Uncle Nick, wake up!
We're rescued, we're saved!

122
00:13:23,845 --> 00:13:25,335
Saved.

123
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:27,447
From what?

124
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,818
Down here!

125
00:13:35,089 --> 00:13:39,753
Jack!
It's me, Audrey!

126
00:13:49,971 --> 00:13:53,498
We've had search parties all over
looking for you and that boat.

127
00:13:53,674 --> 00:13:55,733
They found the boat
300 miles from here.

128
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:59,368
You've been searching for me
this whole time? You're a hero!

129
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:02,880
Well, you found me.
You did say you weren't married?

130
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:06,349
Actually, I was flying over
to check a hotel I own...

131
00:14:06,521 --> 00:14:10,116
...on the other side of the island
when I saw Eddie on the cliff.

132
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:12,725
Probably, nobody
thought of looking here.

133
00:14:12,894 --> 00:14:16,091
Well, it's only 10 miles,
you could have walked to my hotel.

134
00:14:19,267 --> 00:14:20,757
Well, I...

135
00:14:20,935 --> 00:14:23,802
...guess we better pack up
and get out of here, then.

136
00:14:23,971 --> 00:14:28,431
Man. You know, I got all excited
when I first saw the plane...

137
00:14:28,609 --> 00:14:31,009
...but I'm really gonna
miss this place.

138
00:14:31,179 --> 00:14:35,172
This was the best vacation
this family has ever had.

139
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:37,816
Oh, well.

140
00:14:37,985 --> 00:14:41,352
It was great, but it'll be good
to get back to civilization.

141
00:14:41,522 --> 00:14:44,218
Civilization.
People like to live in crowds...

142
00:14:44,392 --> 00:14:46,485
...because they don't trust each other.

143
00:14:46,661 --> 00:14:49,926
I don't know,
there's some good things about civilization.

144
00:14:50,098 --> 00:14:51,759
Name one.

145
00:14:51,933 --> 00:14:55,699
Massages, manicures,
frozen artichokes...

146
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:58,805
...hot tubs, champagne.

147
00:14:58,973 --> 00:15:01,237
I wanna say something.

148
00:15:01,409 --> 00:15:04,378
I'm gonna miss
not having a lot of things.

149
00:15:04,545 --> 00:15:10,381
It's been great without telephones
and people you never even met calling...

150
00:15:10,551 --> 00:15:13,679
...trying to sell you things
you don't even need.

151
00:15:13,855 --> 00:15:16,688
And rap music on beer commercials...

152
00:15:16,858 --> 00:15:19,053
...and junk mail!

153
00:15:20,328 --> 00:15:23,593
I'm gonna miss
us all being so together...

154
00:15:23,764 --> 00:15:26,631
...and the way everybody chipped in
and worked.

155
00:15:26,801 --> 00:15:30,669
- It was a Christmas thing.
- I saw an airplane!

156
00:15:30,838 --> 00:15:34,137
I saw an airplane!
We're saved!

157
00:15:35,276 --> 00:15:37,608
We're saved!

158
00:15:38,579 --> 00:15:40,638
I saw a plane!

159
00:15:43,151 --> 00:15:44,812
Jack!

160
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:47,815
What are you doing here?

161
00:15:55,229 --> 00:15:59,097
Merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas!

162
00:16:00,067 --> 00:16:02,661
This was the best Christmas
I've ever had.

163
00:16:02,837 --> 00:16:05,965
It was fun being a part of your family
here on...

164
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:09,974
- What is the name of this island?
- It was named after King Halehalki...

165
00:16:10,144 --> 00:16:13,113
...but you can change it.
He was a headhunter.

166
00:16:13,614 --> 00:16:16,845
I say we rename it Eddie Island...

167
00:16:17,018 --> 00:16:20,283
...in honor of the man who killed the boar.

168
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:21,681
Well.

169
00:16:24,091 --> 00:16:27,788
- What business did you say you were in?
- I was in nuclear research.

170
00:16:27,962 --> 00:16:31,489
- You're kidding.
- No, no. Nuclear research.

171
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:36,000
But then I got laid off.
But then, because I got bit on the ass...

172
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:38,502
...they gave me this here
Christmas vacation.

173
00:16:38,673 --> 00:16:41,403
You got laid off?
Did the company downsize?

174
00:16:41,576 --> 00:16:44,602
Yeah, well, the other guy,
he's a lot smaller than I was.

175
00:16:44,779 --> 00:16:46,303
I was better at the job.

176
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:50,078
- Jack's incredible, isn't he?
- Yeah, he's a really great guy.

177
00:16:50,251 --> 00:16:55,553
- He's so mature.
- Big deal. Uncle Nick's mature.

178
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:03,429
This is liable to roll down a hill
and kill a little pig or something.

179
00:17:03,598 --> 00:17:05,589
I better move this.

180
00:17:05,933 --> 00:17:10,199
Hey, hold it. You gonna bust your rollers
trying to move that. Let me help you.

181
00:17:10,371 --> 00:17:12,134
Put it over there.

182
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:17,032
- Where?
- Over there.

183
00:17:21,215 --> 00:17:24,343
Let go, let go, you're choking me.

184
00:17:24,518 --> 00:17:27,316
- What?
- Let go!

185
00:17:27,488 --> 00:17:29,388
All right.

186
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:37,920
Jack?

187
00:17:39,133 --> 00:17:42,068
- Oh, Jack, don't get up.
- I'm all right.

188
00:17:42,236 --> 00:17:45,637
No, no. Jack, you took a terrible fall.
You need rest and care.

189
00:17:45,806 --> 00:17:47,740
I'm fine.

190
00:17:50,845 --> 00:17:56,215
I wouldn't go into a career in the moving
business any time soon, if I were you.

191
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:05,589
You all ready to fly?

192
00:18:25,012 --> 00:18:28,004
I'm gonna really miss
the old homestead.

193
00:18:38,726 --> 00:18:41,320
Jack, you okay?

194
00:18:41,962 --> 00:18:47,093
I'm okay, it's just a headache.
There are some aspirin in the cabin.

195
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:57,573
- His head hurts.
- Oh, my God.

196
00:18:57,745 --> 00:19:00,077
Oh, my God, he needs me!
He needs me!

197
00:19:00,247 --> 00:19:02,841
Now, now, he'll be all right.

198
00:19:03,017 --> 00:19:05,212
Just got a headache.

199
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:13,820
He'll be all right.

200
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:24,435
Maluka tower,
this is Mike 808 Mike...

201
00:19:24,605 --> 00:19:28,564
...Melbourne Jack here.
I've just picked up some lost souls...

202
00:19:28,743 --> 00:19:33,043
...on the rear end of King Halehalki Island.
- Eddie Island!

203
00:19:34,014 --> 00:19:36,608
Our position is...

204
00:19:37,485 --> 00:19:39,953
Hell, I don't know where we are.

205
00:19:41,489 --> 00:19:43,957
I'm not too well, my friend.

206
00:19:44,759 --> 00:19:47,626
I like you, Ed. You're a good man.

207
00:19:48,596 --> 00:19:53,192
You're not the brightest bulb
in the chandelier, but you're a good man.

208
00:19:59,673 --> 00:20:02,039
- Jack!
<i>- Mike 808 Mike...</i>

209
00:20:02,209 --> 00:20:04,871
<i>... say again your position, over.</i>

210
00:20:05,446 --> 00:20:06,640
Help!

211
00:20:06,814 --> 00:20:10,011
<i>This is Maluka tower, merry Christmas.</i>
<i>Is that you, Jack?</i>

212
00:20:10,184 --> 00:20:15,520
No, it's Eddie!
Jack, he fainted, or he's dead.

213
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:19,220
Jack, snap out of it!
Snap out of it!

214
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:24,624
- Oh, he's not dead, he moved.
<i>- Well, okay, Eddie, merry Christmas.</i>

215
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:26,699
<i>Can you fly a plane?</i>

216
00:20:28,035 --> 00:20:30,765
<i>I'll take that as a no.</i>

217
00:20:32,573 --> 00:20:36,737
<i>We got you on radar now,</i>
<i>you're heading right for Maluka Airport.</i>

218
00:20:36,911 --> 00:20:40,472
<i>- All you're gonna have to do is, well, land.</i>
- We're gonna die.

219
00:20:40,648 --> 00:20:44,744
<i>Now, relax. When we get you over</i>
<i>the airport, we're going to talk you in.</i>

220
00:20:44,919 --> 00:20:46,318
<i>And Eddie?</i>

221
00:20:46,487 --> 00:20:47,852
Yeah?

222
00:20:48,022 --> 00:20:51,890
<i>We're gonna clear the area</i>
<i>of all incoming and outgoing flights.</i>

223
00:20:52,059 --> 00:20:55,756
<i>All you're gonna have to worry</i>
<i>about is to make a nice landing...</i>

224
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:57,625
<i>... right there on the tarmac.</i>

225
00:20:57,798 --> 00:21:00,995
<i>You'll go down</i>
<i>gradually and just coast on in.</i>

226
00:21:01,168 --> 00:21:06,105
- Okay. Okay.
- Dad! Dad, you can't land on the tarmac!

227
00:21:06,273 --> 00:21:12,269
- Probably not, but I gotta try.
- This is a seaplane, Dad, a seaplane!

228
00:21:12,446 --> 00:21:16,906
Tower! Tower!
Mr. Tower, this is a seaplane!

229
00:21:17,084 --> 00:21:19,644
<i>Damn, forgot. Right. Shoot.</i>

230
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:22,345
<i>I'm getting so absent-minded.</i>

231
00:21:22,523 --> 00:21:26,687
<i>Even easier. You'll just land right there</i>
<i>in the bay in front of the airport...</i>

232
00:21:26,861 --> 00:21:28,852
<i>... and we'll come on out and get you.</i>

233
00:21:29,029 --> 00:21:33,762
<i>Now, just sit back,</i>
<i>stay on course and relax.</i>

234
00:21:33,934 --> 00:21:35,367
<i>No sweat.</i>

235
00:21:37,872 --> 00:21:39,396
How's Jack?

236
00:21:39,573 --> 00:21:42,133
Audrey's breathing into his mouth.

237
00:21:43,177 --> 00:21:45,407
<i>Okay, easy does it.</i>

238
00:21:45,579 --> 00:21:48,480
<i>Loosen your clothing.</i>
<i>Good.</i>

239
00:21:48,649 --> 00:21:52,847
Planes will never replace boats
as a means of transportation.

240
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:56,854
- People like to stay close to terra firma.
- Uncle Nick.

241
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:59,652
Boats still sail on water, not earth.

242
00:22:00,194 --> 00:22:02,424
<i>Okay, Eddie, we got you in sight now.</i>

243
00:22:02,997 --> 00:22:04,259
There's the airport!

244
00:22:04,431 --> 00:22:08,265
<i>Now, here's what we want you to do:</i>
<i>We want you to look at the altimeter.</i>

245
00:22:08,435 --> 00:22:10,335
- Where is it?
<i>- All right, calm down.</i>

246
00:22:10,504 --> 00:22:13,837
<i>It's the gauge on the right-hand side</i>
<i>of the panel.</i>

247
00:22:14,008 --> 00:22:19,913
<i>You're now at 2000 feet. I want you</i>
<i>to turn the wheel very slowly to your left...</i>

248
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:25,677
<i>... press it down gradually, very slowly.</i>

249
00:22:29,156 --> 00:22:31,147
<i>- And Eddie?</i>
- Yeah?

250
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:33,716
<i>Merry Christmas.</i>
<i>Up.</i>

251
00:22:34,428 --> 00:22:35,656
<i>Up.</i>

252
00:22:35,829 --> 00:22:39,890
<i>Up!</i>
<i>Pull it up, Eddie, come on!</i>

253
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:41,557
<i>Oh, no.</i>
<i>No!</i>

254
00:22:42,102 --> 00:22:43,865
<i>No, Eddie!</i>

255
00:22:45,439 --> 00:22:50,138
<i>Okay, Eddie, we're gonna</i>
<i>try it again now, slowly.</i>

256
00:22:50,311 --> 00:22:53,610
<i>Slow, you damn idiot!</i>
<i>Don't you know what slow means?</i>

257
00:22:53,781 --> 00:22:57,217
Slow, you damn idiot!
Don't you know what slow means?

258
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,244
Muka?

259
00:23:01,422 --> 00:23:05,552
If we don't die,
will you be my girlfriend?

260
00:23:05,726 --> 00:23:07,717
Well, thank you, Third.

261
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:12,527
I think you're terrific,
but I don't think you're quite...

262
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:15,897
...grown-up enough for me.
- I am grown up.

263
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:18,095
I've even seen a naked woman.

264
00:23:19,873 --> 00:23:23,274
Anyway, if we don't die,
I'm going back to my husband.

265
00:23:23,444 --> 00:23:26,607
- Your husband?
- Yes, Daniel.

266
00:23:27,581 --> 00:23:30,049
He lives in Indianapolis.

267
00:23:32,553 --> 00:23:35,886
<i>Now, let's try it again there, Eddie, baby.</i>
<i>And Eddie...</i>

268
00:23:36,056 --> 00:23:39,116
<i>... you see that tall building</i>
<i>with the glass all around it?</i>

269
00:23:39,293 --> 00:23:43,286
<i>Good. Whatever you do,</i>
<i>don't hit that building.</i>

270
00:23:43,464 --> 00:23:47,059
<i>You see, that's the tower, Eddie,</i>
<i>and that's where I am.</i>

271
00:23:47,234 --> 00:23:50,795
<i>Now, what we're gonna do,</i>
<i>you're gonna turn the wheel slowly...</i>

272
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:53,872
<i>... to the left again and press down.</i>

273
00:23:56,844 --> 00:23:58,869
<i>No! No, Eddie!</i>

274
00:23:59,046 --> 00:24:01,674
<i>No! No!</i>

275
00:24:13,727 --> 00:24:17,094
Dad, it's just like the time
you drove the RV...

276
00:24:17,264 --> 00:24:20,290
...off the side of the mountain
and broke your leg.

277
00:24:20,467 --> 00:24:22,230
Only, more dangerous.

278
00:24:24,972 --> 00:24:28,965
It's more like the time you were fishing
off that bridge and reached down...

279
00:24:29,143 --> 00:24:32,510
...to tie your shoelaces
and fell 50 feet into the water.

280
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:35,114
Only, this time we could all die.

281
00:24:38,052 --> 00:24:41,886
You can do it, Dad, I know you can.

282
00:25:07,381 --> 00:25:08,609
Oh, my.

283
00:25:08,782 --> 00:25:10,909
Oh, my.

284
00:25:22,763 --> 00:25:25,129
Oh, my God!

285
00:25:38,779 --> 00:25:40,269
Bingo.

286
00:25:48,756 --> 00:25:50,417
<i>And merry Christmas, Maluka.</i>

287
00:25:50,591 --> 00:25:53,958
<i>We all heard about the shipwrecked</i>
<i>Johnsons. Here's a video...</i>

288
00:25:54,128 --> 00:25:58,929
<i>... from their daughter, currently appearing</i>
<i>at the Bare Bottom Club in Las Vegas.</i>

289
00:26:10,744 --> 00:26:14,009
Merry Christmas, Third!
How's my boy?

290
00:26:14,181 --> 00:26:17,514
Aunt Jessica, you wouldn't believe
what we've been through.

291
00:26:17,684 --> 00:26:20,414
Not gonna show me travel movies,
are you, Third?

292
00:26:20,587 --> 00:26:21,781
Later.

293
00:26:21,955 --> 00:26:25,322
Okay, so where's that old man of mine?

294
00:26:25,492 --> 00:26:27,517
- And where are your folks?
- Oh, well...

295
00:26:27,694 --> 00:26:31,790
...my Mom and Dad and cousin Audrey
are visiting a friend in the hospital.

296
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:35,366
Dad dropped a rock on him
and gave him a brain concussion.

297
00:26:35,536 --> 00:26:38,664
- And Uncle Nick's resting.
- You go up and tell him I'm here.

298
00:26:38,839 --> 00:26:41,865
If I walk in on him,
he's liable to have a heart attack.

299
00:26:42,042 --> 00:26:43,532
Sure.

300
00:26:47,447 --> 00:26:50,746
Aunt Jessica, you didn't, did you?

301
00:26:52,052 --> 00:26:53,781
Don't ask.

302
00:26:58,258 --> 00:27:01,421
Boy, that Jack. He is okay, isn't he?
What a great guy.

303
00:27:01,595 --> 00:27:04,689
And he didn't even mention
that I almost killed him.

304
00:27:04,865 --> 00:27:06,765
I can't believe it.

305
00:27:06,934 --> 00:27:10,165
He's married.
Five kids.

306
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:13,465
I mean, my God,
can't any man be trusted?

307
00:27:14,107 --> 00:27:18,066
He was the great love of my life.
I'll never love again.

308
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:21,247
Merry Christmas!

309
00:27:21,915 --> 00:27:23,075
Merry Christmas.

310
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:26,811
- Is he all right?
- It's my husband.

311
00:27:26,987 --> 00:27:28,682
Nervous breakdown.

312
00:27:29,489 --> 00:27:31,719
Merry Christmas!

313
00:27:33,126 --> 00:27:35,686
I'm so sorry.
How long has he been like this?

314
00:27:36,296 --> 00:27:39,459
Since this morning.
He's an air traffic controller.

315
00:27:44,304 --> 00:27:45,566
Hey, buddy!

316
00:27:45,739 --> 00:27:47,866
Merry Christmas!

317
00:27:48,775 --> 00:27:50,504
Come on, buddy, snap out of it.

318
00:27:50,677 --> 00:27:53,646
Snap out of it!

319
00:27:53,814 --> 00:27:55,543
No, Eddie!

320
00:27:55,716 --> 00:27:58,708
Bless you!
Oh, thank you!

321
00:27:58,886 --> 00:28:02,413
You are a miracle worker.

322
00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:06,352
Come on, let's get back
to the motel.

323
00:28:07,461 --> 00:28:09,429
I may become a nun.

324
00:28:14,301 --> 00:28:15,893
Aunt Jessica.

325
00:28:17,537 --> 00:28:20,768
So you finally got tired
of that young fellow...

326
00:28:20,941 --> 00:28:24,206
...and you decided to come crawling back
to Uncle Nick.

327
00:28:24,945 --> 00:28:27,243
And you're gonna take her back,
I suppose.

328
00:28:27,848 --> 00:28:30,817
Well, I have seen it all now.

329
00:28:30,984 --> 00:28:34,385
If anybody wants me, I'll be in the can.

330
00:28:39,559 --> 00:28:42,995
I'm sorry for that
little unpleasantness, darling.

331
00:28:44,097 --> 00:28:47,726
That pig snot
never did have no manners.

332
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:53,134
When you're finished, get your butt into
the kitchen and fix me a decent dinner.

333
00:28:53,307 --> 00:28:56,606
I've been eating nothing
but burnt pig and bananas.

334
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:19,697
They're waiting for you inside, Eddie.

335
00:29:19,866 --> 00:29:21,959
Thank you, Milwaukee.

336
00:29:22,536 --> 00:29:24,128
Hi, Muka.

337
00:29:24,671 --> 00:29:26,901
There's something I've gotta tell you.

338
00:29:28,542 --> 00:29:32,774
You know, I'm sorry about
asking you to be my girl...

339
00:29:36,016 --> 00:29:38,109
...but I'm engaged.

340
00:29:40,687 --> 00:29:43,520
She's beautiful.

341
00:29:46,093 --> 00:29:48,323
Well, it'll take a while to get over it.

342
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:51,254
Yeah.

343
00:29:54,368 --> 00:29:55,528
Eddie!

344
00:29:55,702 --> 00:30:00,230
Eddie, Eddie, Eddie!

345
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:06,604
Oh, Professor Doornitz!

346
00:30:09,082 --> 00:30:13,280
We are so proud of you.
All the newspapers carried your story.

347
00:30:14,254 --> 00:30:18,281
Shipwrecked, swam 30 miles
to rescue your family...

348
00:30:18,458 --> 00:30:21,154
...built a two-story house
with your own hands...

349
00:30:21,328 --> 00:30:24,024
...killed a wild boar
with manicure scissors!

350
00:30:25,332 --> 00:30:26,822
Well...

351
00:30:32,272 --> 00:30:34,331
What's he doing here?

352
00:30:34,508 --> 00:30:37,375
You're replacing him.
He's here on vacation.

353
00:30:41,214 --> 00:30:43,512
Oh, no.

354
00:30:44,017 --> 00:30:46,247
I'm staying right here.

355
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:50,379
I got myself a new job.

356
00:30:55,095 --> 00:30:56,619
Well, Roy...

357
00:30:56,797 --> 00:31:00,824
...looks like this is the beginning
of a beautiful friendship.
