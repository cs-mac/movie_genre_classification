<font color="#ff00ff">I see.</font>

82
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:55,782
<font color="#ff00ff">And then...</font>

83

<font color="#ff00ff">Later on...</font>

84

90
00:08:14,694 --> 00:08:16,765
<font color="#ff00ff">No! I wouldn't say that.</font>

91
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:20,604
<font color="#ff00ff">But I no longer need to work.</font>

92
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:24,147
<font color="#ff00ff">You have enough money
to live until you die.</font>

93
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:28,516
<font color="#ff00ff">Far more than that.</font>

100
00:09:22,561 --> 00:09:23,904
<font color="#ff00ff">Yes, I can imagine.</font>

101
00:09:24,697 --> 00:09:28,304
<font color="#ff00ff">And yet... as you said yourself,
it's very important.</font>

102
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:29,912
<font color="#ff00ff">But I'm not sure...</font>

103
00:09:31,036 --> 00:09:33,380
<font color="#ff00ff">I'm not sure that I can...</font>

00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:37,020
<font color="#ff00ff">that I know how.</font>

105
00:09:39,945 --> 00:09:42,482
<font color="#ff00ff">I'd like to try it out beforehand.</font>

106
00:09:44,049 --> 00:09:45,323
<font color="#ff00ff">Try out what?</font>

107
00:09:45,518 --> 00:09:46,588
<font color="#ff00ff">A family.</font>

108
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:49,395
<font color="#ff00ff">Try out a family?</font>

109
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:57,906
<font color="#ff00ff">Here's my proposal.</font>

110
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:00,771
<font color="#ff00ff">I'll pay your debts
and one year's wages.</font>

111
00:10:00,966 --> 00:10:04,573
<font color="#ff00ff">I'll ensure that the State
doesn't take your children away.</font>

112
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,181
<font color="#ff00ff">And in exchange...</font>

113
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:09,685
<font color="#ff00ff">you let me be part of your family.</font>

114
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:18,896
<font color="#ff00ff">I let you be part of my family?</font>

115
00:10:20,085 --> 00:10:21,086
<font color="#ff00ff">Yes.</font>

116
00:10:22,922 --> 00:10:24,526
<font color="#ff00ff">He's mentally ill!</font>

117
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:26,198
<font color="#ff00ff">He's got real problems.</font>

118
00:10:26,392 --> 00:10:28,531
<font color="#ff00ff">No one in real life
wants a guy like that.</font>

119
00:10:28,727 --> 00:10:32,300
<font color="#ff00ff">No wonder he's locked up all alone
in his psychotic ward.</font>

120
00:10:32,498 --> 00:10:34,808
<font color="#ff00ff">He's different.
He's not a bad person.</font>

121
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:38,438
<font color="#ff00ff">May I?</font>

122
00:10:38,637 --> 00:10:39,945
<font color="#ff00ff">Help yourself.</font>

123
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:41,243
<font color="#ff00ff">Thank you.</font>

124
00:10:44,743 --> 00:10:48,919
<font color="#ff00ff">It's not because he doesn't
have a family that he can buy one.</font>

125
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:51,120
<font color="#ff00ff">No one does that.</font>

126
00:10:53,853 --> 00:10:56,265
<font color="#ff00ff">He wants me to lie to my children?</font>

127
00:10:56,455 --> 00:10:58,799
<font color="#ff00ff">Make them think I met some...</font>

128
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:03,102
<font color="#ff00ff">Who's the guy who wears a black cape
and lives in a cave?</font>

129
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,069
<font color="#ff00ff">Batman.</font>

130
00:11:04,263 --> 00:11:05,298
<font color="#ff00ff">Yeah, that's it.</font>

131
00:11:05,965 --> 00:11:07,945
<font color="#ff00ff">Just thinking about it makes me...</font>

132
00:11:11,437 --> 00:11:13,007
<font color="#ff00ff">Just for money...</font>

133
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:15,678
<font color="#ff00ff">and debts...</font>

134
00:11:16,642 --> 00:11:18,178
<font color="#ff00ff">A shitload of debts.</font>

135
00:11:24,884 --> 00:11:27,831
<font color="#ff00ff">Firstly, not a word to the kids.</font>

136
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:30,325
<font color="#ff00ff">In my world, love can't be bought.</font>

137
00:11:30,522 --> 00:11:32,968
<font color="#ff00ff">And I want it to stay that way
for my kids. Ok?</font>

138
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:34,437
<font color="#ff00ff">Secondly,</font>

139
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:37,335
<font color="#ff00ff">we make them think
that we're really in love.</font>

142
00:11:42,501 --> 00:11:44,481
<font color="#ff00ff">Yes.
It happens to me all the time.</font>

143
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:47,310
<font color="#ff00ff">Both my kids' fathers
were love at first sight.</font>

144
00:11:47,506 --> 00:11:49,383
<font color="#ff00ff">Even if they didn't stick around.</font>

145
00:11:50,976 --> 00:11:51,784
<font color="#ff00ff">Trio...</font>

<font color="#ff00ff">Thirdly.</font>

147
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:54,958
<font color="#ff00ff">- What?
- Excuse me.</font>

148
00:11:55,714 --> 00:11:56,886
<font color="#ff00ff">You move in with me.</font>

149
00:11:57,082 --> 00:11:59,358
<font color="#ff00ff">Because this is...</font>

150
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:00,856
<font color="#ff00ff">No.</font>

151
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:01,895
<font color="#ff00ff">No way.</font>

152
00:12:02,087 --> 00:12:04,795
<font color="#ff00ff">There's no way
my kids are moving into this...</font>

153
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:06,196
<font color="#ff00ff">bunker.</font>

154
00:12:09,094 --> 00:12:11,631
<font color="#ff00ff">I understand,
but you can't say this is...</font>

155
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:15,403
<font color="#ff00ff">My kids have their habits.
School, their rooms, their friends...</font>

156
00:12:15,601 --> 00:12:17,080
<font color="#ff00ff">I won't upset their lives.</font>

157
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:21,147
<font color="#ff00ff">No more sports cars or rich kid's toys.</font>

158
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:24,048
<font color="#ff00ff">I agree.
No outward signs of conspicuous...</font>

161
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:30,086
<font color="#ff00ff">You sort out my problems
and in three months</font>

162
00:12:30,282 --> 00:12:31,386
<font color="#ff00ff">we say goodbye.</font>

163
00:12:34,753 --> 00:12:35,857

164
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:38,193
<font color="#ff00ff">Is that all?</font>

165

<font color="#ff00ff">For now.</font>

166
00:12:40,392 --> 00:12:41,496
<font color="#ff00ff">Very well.</font>

167
00:12:42,795 --> 00:12:46,504
<font color="#ff00ff">We're off to live
a three-month family adventure!</font>

168
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:48,742
<font color="#ff00ff">I want a contract.</font>

169
00:12:49,401 --> 00:12:53,577
<font color="#ff00ff">A clear and precise contract.
In three months, the game is over.</font>

170
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:56,849
<font color="#ff00ff">Goodbye, Violet.</font>

171
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,016
<font color="#ff00ff">I guess...</font>

172
00:13:04,249 --> 00:13:05,455
<font color="#ff00ff">we're going to...</font>

173
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:08,022
<font color="#ff00ff">That I'll have to...</font>

174
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:10,962
<font color="#ff00ff">Excuse me?</font>

175
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:13,128
<font color="#ff00ff">That we'll sleep together.</font>

176
00:13:15,661 --> 00:13:17,299
<font color="#ff00ff">- We'll have to...
-Yes?</font>

177
00:13:17,496 --> 00:13:19,737
<font color="#ff00ff">We'll have to sleep in the same room.</font>

178
00:13:21,834 --> 00:13:23,108
<font color="#ff00ff">Yeah, I see.</font>

179
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:25,615
<font color="#ff00ff">No, no, no!</font>

180
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:27,643
<font color="#ff00ff">Nothing else.</font>

181
00:13:31,076 --> 00:13:32,248
<font color="#ff00ff">Nothing else?</font>

182
00:13:34,246 --> 00:13:35,884
<font color="#ff00ff">I wouldn't dream of it.</font>

183
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:39,930
<font color="#ff00ff">I'm trying out a family,
not a woman.</font>

184
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:42,626
<font color="#ff00ff">You mean...</font>

185
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:45,961
<font color="#ff00ff">- I don't have to...
- No.</font>

186
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:49,131
<font color="#ff00ff">Really?</font>

187
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:52,131
<font color="#ff00ff">Ok.</font>

188
00:13:53,432 --> 00:13:54,274
<font color="#ff00ff">If you say so.</font>

189
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,604
<font color="#ff00ff">See you Monday.</font>

190
00:14:31,703 --> 00:14:33,683
<font color="#ff00ff">Drive around the block again, Leon.</font>

191
00:14:33,872 --> 00:14:37,285
<font color="#ff00ff">- It's the fourth time, sir.
-I know. It's the last time.</font>

192
00:14:37,476 --> 00:14:39,786
<font color="#ff00ff">Then you can drop me off
on the comer.</font>

193
00:14:39,978 --> 00:14:40,979
<font color="#ff00ff">Alright?</font>

194
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:03,168
<font color="#ff00ff">Are you going to sleep here?</font>

195
00:15:03,368 --> 00:15:05,541
<font color="#ff00ff">Of course!
He's my sweetheart.</font>

196
00:15:05,938 --> 00:15:07,212
<font color="#ff00ff">Since when?</font>

197
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:10,315
<font color="#ff00ff">No one told us.
We're your kids, aren't we?</font>

198
00:15:10,876 --> 00:15:12,321
<font color="#ff00ff">Yes, of course.</font>

199
00:15:12,511 --> 00:15:14,320
<font color="#ff00ff">But we only met...</font>

200
00:15:15,514 --> 00:15:16,515
<font color="#ff00ff">three days ago.</font>

201
00:15:16,715 --> 00:15:18,217
<font color="#ff00ff">And so... it was...</font>

202
00:15:18,884 --> 00:15:19,988
<font color="#ff00ff">it was...</font>

203
00:15:20,185 --> 00:15:21,823
<font color="#ff00ff">It was love at first sight.</font>

204
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:24,159
<font color="#ff00ff">That's it. Love at first sight.</font>

205
00:15:24,356 --> 00:15:25,664
<font color="#ff00ff">Again?</font>

206
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:29,733
<font color="#ff00ff">The players want to hear their fans!</font>

207
00:15:29,928 --> 00:15:31,236
<font color="#ff00ff">Super! Yes, yes!</font>

208
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:32,770
<font color="#ff00ff">Only this time...</font>

209
00:15:34,766 --> 00:15:35,506
<font color="#ff00ff">it's serious.</font>

210
00:15:35,701 --> 00:15:37,681
<font color="#ff00ff">I thought you'd had it with love?</font>

211
00:15:38,137 --> 00:15:41,414
<font color="#ff00ff">You don't control
this kind of thing, Lucie.</font>

212
00:15:42,307 --> 00:15:44,548
<font color="#ff00ff">It hits you over the head...</font>

213
00:15:44,743 --> 00:15:46,279
<font color="#ff00ff">like a ton of bricks!</font>

214
00:15:48,213 --> 00:15:50,022
<font color="#ff00ff">An Olympic record!</font>

215
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:52,923
<font color="#ff00ff">How did you meet?</font>

216
00:15:55,487 --> 00:15:57,524
<font color="#ff00ff">I saw your mother on TV.</font>

217
00:15:58,123 --> 00:15:59,568
<font color="#ff00ff">On T\/.</font>

218
00:16:00,225 --> 00:16:02,432
<font color="#ff00ff">I found her strikingly beautiful.</font>

219
00:16:02,761 --> 00:16:04,297
<font color="#ff00ff">And by pure chance,</font>

220
00:16:04,496 --> 00:16:06,635
<font color="#ff00ff">we ran into each other...</font>

221
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:08,742
<font color="#ff00ff">at the employment office.</font>

222
00:16:08,934 --> 00:16:09,912
<font color="#ff00ff">Oh, brother.</font>

223
00:16:12,971 --> 00:16:17,750
<font color="#ff00ff">I was there because
I want to start up a new company.</font>

224
00:16:19,111 --> 00:16:21,057
<font color="#ff00ff">It takes money to start a company.</font>

225
00:16:21,246 --> 00:16:22,452
<font color="#ff00ff">Of course.</font>

226
00:16:23,282 --> 00:16:24,488
<font color="#ff00ff">But I have money.</font>

227
00:16:24,683 --> 00:16:26,253
<font color="#ff00ff">Yes, he certainly does.</font>

228
00:16:29,188 --> 00:16:31,168
<font color="#ff00ff">Could you tell me what he's doing?</font>

229
00:16:31,356 --> 00:16:33,495
<font color="#ff00ff">The Fosbury Flop.</font>

230
00:16:35,027 --> 00:16:36,267
<font color="#ff00ff">So there you go.</font>

231
00:16:36,695 --> 00:16:38,333
<font color="#ff00ff">We instantly hit it off</font>

232
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:42,171
<font color="#ff00ff">and we decided to live together
for three months.</font>

233
00:16:42,367 --> 00:16:45,143
<font color="#ff00ff">- I mean for life!
-To try it out, for life.</font>

234
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:46,907
<font color="#ff00ff">Do we have anything to say?</font>

235
00:16:47,105 --> 00:16:47,742
<font color="#ff00ff">No.</font>

236
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:50,318
<font color="#ff00ff">Great.
Welcome to North Korea!</font>

237
00:16:52,978 --> 00:16:55,288
<font color="#ff00ff">Do you have kids?</font>

238
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:57,653
<font color="#ff00ff">No.</font>

239
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:00,288
<font color="#ff00ff">Then you can spoil us!</font>

240
00:17:01,954 --> 00:17:03,331
<font color="#ff00ff">Spoil you? Maybe.</font>

241
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:05,593
<font color="#ff00ff">- How about an Xbox One?
- Excuse me?</font>

242
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:06,701
<font color="#ff00ff">Auguste!</font>

243
00:17:06,892 --> 00:17:09,805
<font color="#ff00ff">Get this straight,
there'll be no extra spending.</font>

244
00:17:10,629 --> 00:17:12,165
<font color="#ff00ff">Isn't that right, Mr. Andre?</font>

245
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:14,708
<font color="#ff00ff">- This isn't about money.
-Absolutely not.</font>

246
00:17:14,967 --> 00:17:16,310
<font color="#ff00ff">You call him "mister"?</font>

247
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:22,012
<font color="#ff00ff">Did she call me "mister"?</font>

248
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:25,320
<font color="#ff00ff">Did I say that?</font>

249
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,218
<font color="#ff00ff">I said that?</font>

250
00:17:29,414 --> 00:17:32,224
<font color="#ff00ff">She must've said it for fun,
because otherwise no.</font>

251
00:17:32,417 --> 00:17:33,896
<font color="#ff00ff">No, not that I know of.</font>

252
00:17:34,086 --> 00:17:35,895
<font color="#ff00ff">- No.
-I don't call him "mister."</font>

253
00:17:36,088 --> 00:17:37,465
<font color="#ff00ff">Or maybe for a joke!</font>

254
00:17:39,925 --> 00:17:42,906
<font color="#ff00ff">Excuse me,
could you get off my suitcase?</font>

255
00:17:44,162 --> 00:17:45,732
<font color="#ff00ff">You know what I suggest?</font>

256
00:17:46,531 --> 00:17:48,909
<font color="#ff00ff">To celebrate my arrival...</font>

257
00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:52,310
<font color="#ff00ff">I'll take you out
to the best restaurant in town!</font>

261
00:18:09,454 --> 00:18:11,695

268
00:18:23,635 --> 00:18:24,773
<font color="#ff00ff">What's so funny?</font>

269
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:26,449
<font color="#ff00ff">It's his name.</font>

<font color="#ff00ff">What about your dad?</font>

278
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:48,763
<font color="#ff00ff">My father argued with...</font>

279
00:18:50,228 --> 00:18:51,798
<font color="#ff00ff">My parents fell out.</font>

280
00:18:52,431 --> 00:18:56,743
<font color="#ff00ff">And when my father left,
my mother put me in boarding school.</font>

281
00:18:56,935 --> 00:18:57,913
<font color="#ff00ff">Boarding school?</font>

282
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:59,778
<font color="#ff00ff">You poor thing!</font>

283
00:18:59,971 --> 00:19:02,451
<font color="#ff00ff">No brothers or sisters or anything?</font>

284
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:03,949
<font color="#ff00ff">Nothing at all.</font>

285
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:08,484
<font color="#ff00ff">How old were you when your dad left?</font>

286
00:19:09,014 --> 00:19:10,049
<font color="#ff00ff">Four.</font>

287
00:19:10,682 --> 00:19:12,093
<font color="#ff00ff">Like Lucie's dad.</font>

288
00:19:13,785 --> 00:19:16,595
<font color="#ff00ff">Auguste's dad left before he was born.
Huh, Lucie?</font>

289
00:19:17,522 --> 00:19:19,832
<font color="#ff00ff">Mine left when I was five.</font>

290
00:19:20,025 --> 00:19:22,232
<font color="#ff00ff">Remy was nine and a half
and I was five.</font>

291
00:19:22,427 --> 00:19:23,838
<font color="#ff00ff">Yeah, but we're not weird.</font>

292
00:19:25,163 --> 00:19:26,608
<font color="#ff00ff">Paul-Andre isn't weird.</font>

293
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:28,402
<font color="#ff00ff">Yes, he is.</font>

294
00:19:37,876 --> 00:19:39,651
<font color="#ff00ff">Lucie, is your homework done?</font>

295
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:41,756
<font color="#ff00ff">Then go wash up! Come on!</font>

296
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:44,760
<font color="#ff00ff">No arguing. Do what I say!</font>

297
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:46,827
<font color="#ff00ff">I said to turn that off.</font>

298
00:19:47,018 --> 00:19:49,157
<font color="#ff00ff">I'm not done! I didn't save my game!</font>

299
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:50,992
<font color="#ff00ff">Then it won't be saved.</font>

300
00:19:51,189 --> 00:19:52,793
<font color="#ff00ff">Lucie! Bathroom!</font>

301
00:19:52,991 --> 00:19:54,868
<font color="#ff00ff">I said into the bathroom!</font>

302
00:19:56,661 --> 00:19:58,538
<font color="#ff00ff">Come on, both of you!</font>

303
00:19:58,730 --> 00:19:59,936
<font color="#ff00ff">Stop arguing!</font>

304
00:20:00,132 --> 00:20:02,442
<font color="#ff00ff">I'm turning this off right now.</font>

305
00:20:02,634 --> 00:20:04,113
<font color="#ff00ff">Sweetheart, please.</font>

306
00:20:06,738 --> 00:20:09,116
<font color="#ff00ff">Lucie! I won't say it again!</font>

307
00:20:10,175 --> 00:20:12,018
<font color="#ff00ff">Leave it, I'll take care of it.</font>

308
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:15,657
<font color="#ff00ff">Auguste wants you to say goodnight
and tell him a story.</font>

309
00:20:16,515 --> 00:20:18,290
<font color="#ff00ff">Aren't we going to bed?</font>

310
00:20:18,483 --> 00:20:20,224
<font color="#ff00ff">Nope. Bedtime story first.</font>

311
00:20:22,521 --> 00:20:24,159
<font color="#ff00ff">You want me to do the dishes?</font>

312
00:20:24,356 --> 00:20:25,801
<font color="#ff00ff">We'll do it tomorrow.</font>

313
00:20:25,991 --> 00:20:27,561
<font color="#ff00ff">Paul-Andre, are you coming?</font>

314
00:20:32,197 --> 00:20:33,835
<font color="#ff00ff">I don't know any stories.</font>

315
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:38,177
<font color="#ff00ff">Moreover, I'm not sure
that telling stories is a good idea</font>

316
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:41,408
<font color="#ff00ff">because kids never know
if they're true or not.</font>

317
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:45,078
<font color="#ff00ff">I guarantee you,
bedtime stories are a great idea.</font>

318
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:48,590
<font color="#ff00ff">They can be extremely traumatic.</font>

319
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:50,384
<font color="#ff00ff">One trauma more or less...</font>

320
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:53,654
<font color="#ff00ff">This was your idea.
You wanted to try out a family?</font>

321
00:20:53,852 --> 00:20:56,924
<font color="#ff00ff">Bedtime stories are part of it
and I could use a break.</font>

322
00:20:57,355 --> 00:21:00,859
<font color="#ff00ff">I need to check
the fine print in this contract.</font>

323
00:21:01,259 --> 00:21:03,205
<font color="#ff00ff">That's where you get screwed.</font>

324
00:21:04,396 --> 00:21:05,500
<font color="#ff00ff">Come on!</font>

325
00:21:06,364 --> 00:21:08,708
<font color="#ff00ff">The train literally ran over him!</font>

326
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:11,039
<font color="#ff00ff">Was he squashed?</font>

327
00:21:11,536 --> 00:21:13,209
<font color="#ff00ff">Of course he was squashed!</font>

328
00:21:13,405 --> 00:21:16,943
<font color="#ff00ff">- The train cut him in half.
- Did he die?</font>

329
00:21:17,142 --> 00:21:19,349
<font color="#ff00ff">- Lucie, no smoking at night!
-I'm not!</font>

330
00:21:19,544 --> 00:21:21,182
<font color="#ff00ff">- Did he die or not?
-Yes, he died.</font>

331
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:23,255
<font color="#ff00ff">But what?</font>

332
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:25,257
<font color="#ff00ff">You'll set the house on fire!</font>

333
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:27,123
<font color="#ff00ff">The two halves of his body...</font>

334
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:31,267
<font color="#ff00ff">the top part and the bottom part,
got back together.</font>

335
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:32,298
<font color="#ff00ff">How?</font>

336
00:21:33,158 --> 00:21:35,764
<font color="#ff00ff">- Put that cigarette out right now!
-Leave me alone!</font>

337
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:37,531
<font color="#ff00ff">How did he do it?</font>

338
00:21:37,929 --> 00:21:39,465
<font color="#ff00ff">He crawled.</font>

339
00:21:39,664 --> 00:21:42,440
<font color="#ff00ff">The bottom part crawled back
to the top part.</font>

340
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:46,138
<font color="#ff00ff">Then he looked for the guy
who pushed him under the train</font>

341
00:21:46,338 --> 00:21:47,715
<font color="#ff00ff">to make mincemeat of him.</font>

342
00:21:47,906 --> 00:21:49,112
<font color="#ff00ff">What's mincemeat?</font>

343
00:21:49,307 --> 00:21:51,378
<font color="#ff00ff">Don't tell me what to do, ok?</font>

344
00:21:51,576 --> 00:21:53,783
<font color="#ff00ff">I'm your mother
and you'll do what I say!</font>

345
00:21:54,312 --> 00:21:57,054
<font color="#ff00ff">Mincemeat is ground meat.</font>

346
00:21:58,083 --> 00:21:59,255
<font color="#ff00ff">Ok.</font>

347
00:21:59,451 --> 00:22:01,294
<font color="#ff00ff">Is he going to grind him?</font>

348
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:03,557
<font color="#ff00ff">You'll find out next time.</font>

349
00:22:04,623 --> 00:22:05,795
<font color="#ff00ff">I want to know now.</font>

350
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:06,935
<font color="#ff00ff">I'll run away!</font>

351
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:09,571
<font color="#ff00ff">Next time, ok? Now it's bedtime.</font>

352
00:22:11,162 --> 00:22:13,108
<font color="#ff00ff">- Leon, it's me.
- Yes, sir.</font>

353
00:22:13,298 --> 00:22:16,336
<font color="#ff00ff">You have to get me out of here.
It's horrible.</font>

354
00:22:16,868 --> 00:22:19,280
<font color="#ff00ff">But you just got there.</font>

355
00:22:19,471 --> 00:22:22,077
<font color="#ff00ff">Leon, you know
the downward spiral theory.</font>

356
00:22:22,274 --> 00:22:24,652
<font color="#ff00ff">The cogwheel starts spinning,</font>

357
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:26,982
<font color="#ff00ff">it gains momentum,</font>

358
00:22:27,178 --> 00:22:31,149
<font color="#ff00ff">and the process becomes
increasingly difficult to interrupt.</font>

359
00:22:31,349 --> 00:22:32,851
<font color="#ff00ff">You know that, rig ht?</font>

360
00:22:33,285 --> 00:22:35,356
<font color="#ff00ff">You should see this place!</font>

361
00:22:35,554 --> 00:22:39,161
<font color="#ff00ff">You wouldn't believe how they live.
It's total chaos!</font>

362
00:22:40,191 --> 00:22:42,364
<font color="#ff00ff">- Paul-Andre, are you alright?
-Yes!</font>

363
00:22:42,561 --> 00:22:44,370
<font color="#ff00ff">- Are you sure?
-Of course!</font>

364
00:22:44,563 --> 00:22:46,008
<font color="#ff00ff">I'm having a quick wash.</font>

365
00:22:46,498 --> 00:22:47,841
<font color="#ff00ff">Freshening up!</font>

366
00:22:49,234 --> 00:22:51,043
<font color="#ff00ff">You'll call me back?</font>

367
00:22:51,236 --> 00:22:52,112
<font color="#ff00ff">Of course, sir.</font>

368
00:22:52,304 --> 00:22:53,783
<font color="#ff00ff">- You promise?
- I promise.</font>

369
00:23:01,379 --> 00:23:02,483
<font color="#ff00ff">Sorry.</font>

370
00:23:04,683 --> 00:23:06,219
<font color="#ff00ff">What exactly are you doing?</font>

371
00:23:06,418 --> 00:23:08,830
<font color="#ff00ff">Covering two pushed apart beds
with one quilt</font>

372
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:11,296
<font color="#ff00ff">so it looks like
we're sleeping together.</font>

373
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:12,794
<font color="#ff00ff">Smart thinking.</font>

374
00:23:13,325 --> 00:23:17,671
<font color="#ff00ff">But we need to act a little more
affectionate with each other.</font>

375
00:23:17,862 --> 00:23:19,808
<font color="#ff00ff">Lucie already made a comment.</font>

376
00:23:20,665 --> 00:23:22,235
<font color="#ff00ff">What did she say?</font>

377
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:26,572
<font color="#ff00ff">She said that when
I'm head over heels in love, I'm more...</font>

378
00:23:26,771 --> 00:23:29,342
<font color="#ff00ff">So we'll have to fake it
in front of them.</font>

379
00:23:29,541 --> 00:23:31,043
<font color="#ff00ff">But otherwise, no touching.</font>

380
00:23:32,177 --> 00:23:33,417
<font color="#ff00ff">I'm wiped out.</font>

381
00:23:33,612 --> 00:23:37,389
<font color="#ff00ff">I have a suggestion.
Why don't we get a cleaning lady?</font>

382
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:38,356
<font color="#ff00ff">What for?</font>

383
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:41,030
<font color="#ff00ff">To straighten up a bit.</font>

384
00:23:43,421 --> 00:23:46,595
<font color="#ff00ff">I'm not sure cleaning ladies
know what they're doing.</font>

385
00:23:46,791 --> 00:23:47,769
<font color="#ff00ff">Fine.</font>

386
00:23:50,428 --> 00:23:52,203
<font color="#ff00ff">Can I have the left side?</font>

387
00:23:52,897 --> 00:23:54,274
<font color="#ff00ff">- Sure.
-Thank you.</font>

388
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:08,516
<font color="#ff00ff">Is everything alright
between you and Lucie?</font>

389
00:24:09,247 --> 00:24:10,590
<font color="#ff00ff">Of course. Why?</font>

390
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:13,460
<font color="#ff00ff">Just asking.</font>

391
00:24:19,391 --> 00:24:21,962
<font color="#ff00ff">Tell me... do you mind if I read?</font>

392
00:24:23,261 --> 00:24:24,296
<font color="#ff00ff">If what?</font>

393
00:24:24,496 --> 00:24:27,909
<font color="#ff00ff">If I read?
I need to read to fall asleep.</font>

394
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:32,304
<font color="#ff00ff">But don't worry, I'm fully equipped.</font>

395
00:24:33,471 --> 00:24:34,745
<font color="#ff00ff">I can see that.</font>

396
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:33,437
<font color="#ff00ff">Who are you?</font>

397
00:25:34,365 --> 00:25:35,537
<font color="#ff00ff">Excuse me?</font>

398
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:38,605
<font color="#ff00ff">Are you a homosexual?</font>

399
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:41,707
<font color="#ff00ff">I don't think so.</font>

400
00:25:46,177 --> 00:25:47,349
<font color="#ff00ff">Impotent?</font>

401
00:25:47,545 --> 00:25:48,853
<font color="#ff00ff">Not that either.</font>

402
00:26:03,528 --> 00:26:05,303
<font color="#ff00ff">You are weird, after all.</font>

403
00:26:05,997 --> 00:26:07,340
<font color="#ff00ff">Auguste was right.</font>

404
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:10,041
<font color="#ff00ff">He's got a good eye.</font>

405
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:16,148
<font color="#ff00ff">Men knock you up and split.</font>

406
00:26:16,341 --> 00:26:17,411
<font color="#ff00ff">So no thanks.</font>

407
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:21,590
<font color="#ff00ff">All I want is a good job.
Forget love.</font>

408
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:23,987
<font color="#ff00ff">And one more jerk
won't change my mind!</font>

409
00:26:24,182 --> 00:26:25,490
<font color="#ff00ff">Stop talking like that!</font>

410
00:26:25,683 --> 00:26:27,720
<font color="#ff00ff">No! I'm sick of living like this.</font>

411
00:26:28,119 --> 00:26:29,359

<font color="#ff00ff">Who hit on who?</font>

547
00:34:21,892 --> 00:34:23,132
<font color="#ff00ff">That's a bit too nosy.</font>

548
00:34:24,195 --> 00:34:26,801
<font color="#ff00ff">Mom usually loves telling us.
Doesn't she?</font>

549
00:34:27,531 --> 00:34:29,841
<font color="#ff00ff">Yes, but this time it was...</font>

550
00:34:30,201 --> 00:34:32,511
<font color="#ff00ff">It was me. I'm the one...</font>

551
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:35,377
<font color="#ff00ff">You could say it was me who started.</font>

552
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:42,250
<font color="#ff00ff">I was totally lost
at the unemployment office</font>

553
00:34:42,446 --> 00:34:45,086
<font color="#ff00ff">because I couldn't fill out the forms.</font>

554
00:34:45,283 --> 00:34:48,355
<font color="#ff00ff">And so... I...</font>

555
00:34:48,552 --> 00:34:51,692
<font color="#ff00ff">I'd seen your mother before.
I saw her on TV.</font>

556
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:53,596
<font color="#ff00ff">When I saw him looking at me,</font>

557
00:34:53,791 --> 00:34:56,704
<font color="#ff00ff">I asked for help
and he instantly sat down with me.</font>

558
00:34:56,961 --> 00:34:58,872
<font color="#ff00ff">He filled out the form.</font>

559
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:01,076
<font color="#ff00ff">Just like that!</font>

560
00:35:02,466 --> 00:35:04,912
<font color="#ff00ff">You see... and I...</font>

561
00:35:05,102 --> 00:35:07,605
<font color="#ff00ff">I got up and stood behind him</font>

562
00:35:07,805 --> 00:35:09,944
<font color="#ff00ff">so I could look over his shoulder.</font>

563
00:35:10,141 --> 00:35:12,519
<font color="#ff00ff">And... I saw...</font>

564
00:35:13,311 --> 00:35:14,551
<font color="#ff00ff">I saw...</font>

565
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:17,786
<font color="#ff00ff">The nape of his neck.</font>

566
00:35:17,982 --> 00:35:19,859
<font color="#ff00ff">I saw the nape of his neck.</font>

567
00:35:21,986 --> 00:35:24,694
<font color="#ff00ff">You know, Lucie,
the nape of a man's neck is...</font>

568
00:35:27,124 --> 00:35:29,035
<font color="#ff00ff">You'll understand one day.</font>

569
00:35:29,226 --> 00:35:30,398
<font color="#ff00ff">Yes, it's...</font>

570
00:35:30,828 --> 00:35:33,206
<font color="#ff00ff">And I fell head over heels in love.</font>

571
00:35:33,564 --> 00:35:36,306
<font color="#ff00ff">I instantly wanted...</font>

572
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:37,808
<font color="#ff00ff">to touch him.</font>

573
00:35:38,002 --> 00:35:39,208
<font color="#ff00ff">Like this.</font>

574
00:35:41,572 --> 00:35:44,644
<font color="#ff00ff">Of course, I didn't do it.</font>

575
00:35:45,276 --> 00:35:47,722
<font color="#ff00ff">But you must have sensed
that I wanted to?</font>

576
00:35:48,312 --> 00:35:49,222
<font color="#ff00ff">Yes.</font>

577
00:35:49,413 --> 00:35:51,984
<font color="#ff00ff">- Did you feel it or not?
-Yes.</font>

578
00:35:54,785 --> 00:35:56,731
<font color="#ff00ff">Yes, he felt it.</font>

579
00:35:57,922 --> 00:36:00,334
<font color="#ff00ff">He must have felt it because...</font>

580
00:36:01,926 --> 00:36:03,906
<font color="#ff00ff">he took my hand like this.</font>

581
00:36:04,161 --> 00:36:05,333
<font color="#ff00ff">Right away.</font>

582
00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:08,407
<font color="#ff00ff">And it lasted...</font>

583
00:36:09,533 --> 00:36:11,342
<font color="#ff00ff">It lasted a very longtime.</font>

584
00:36:12,169 --> 00:36:12,977
<font color="#ff00ff">It was...</font>

585
00:36:14,805 --> 00:36:16,250
<font color="#ff00ff">It was...</font>

586
00:36:18,175 --> 00:36:19,654
<font color="#ff00ff">It was...</font>

587
00:36:20,277 --> 00:36:21,688
<font color="#ff00ff">A Monday.</font>

588
00:36:22,113 --> 00:36:24,821
<font color="#ff00ff">- It was Monday.
-Yes, that's right.</font>

589
00:36:25,716 --> 00:36:26,922
<font color="#ff00ff">And...</font>

590
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,292
<font color="#ff00ff">That's all.</font>

591
00:36:31,322 --> 00:36:32,767
<font color="#ff00ff">That's what happened.</font>

592
00:36:42,133 --> 00:36:44,272
<font color="#ff00ff">The quickest pick-up in history.</font>

593
00:36:45,069 --> 00:36:47,982
<font color="#ff00ff">Yes! We made the Guinness Book.</font>

594
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:52,983
<font color="#ff00ff">You're all red.</font>

595
00:36:54,211 --> 00:36:55,349
<font color="#ff00ff">I am?</font>

596
00:36:56,347 --> 00:36:57,849
<font color="#ff00ff">It must be...</font>

597
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:00,157
<font color="#ff00ff">the memory of...</font>

598
00:37:00,584 --> 00:37:02,723
<font color="#ff00ff">the emotion of the memory.</font>

599
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:05,857
<font color="#ff00ff">He's a real marshmallow at heart.</font>

600
00:37:07,158 --> 00:37:08,296
<font color="#ff00ff">Oh,yes.</font>

601
00:37:11,429 --> 00:37:13,670
<font color="#ff00ff">Didn't you say your mom was dead?</font>

602
00:37:13,864 --> 00:37:16,401
<font color="#ff00ff">- Absolutely.
- Because she's calling you.</font>

603
00:37:17,535 --> 00:37:19,139
<font color="#ff00ff">It says "Mother."</font>

604
00:37:20,671 --> 00:37:21,877
<font color="#ff00ff">So it does!</font>

605
00:37:23,507 --> 00:37:26,886
<font color="#ff00ff">When you say "my whole family is dead,"
it means everyone!</font>

606
00:37:27,077 --> 00:37:28,522
<font color="#ff00ff">You don't joke about that.</font>

607
00:37:29,079 --> 00:37:31,650
<font color="#ff00ff">My whole family is dead,
except my mother.</font>

608
00:37:31,849 --> 00:37:32,919
<font color="#ff00ff">Small detail.</font>

609
00:37:33,117 --> 00:37:36,894
<font color="#ff00ff">My mother and I rarely speak.
It's as if she were dead.</font>

610
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:38,695
<font color="#ff00ff">That's terrible!</font>

611
00:37:38,889 --> 00:37:42,564
<font color="#ff00ff">If my mother were alive,
I'd smother her to death with kisses.</font>

612
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,205
<font color="#ff00ff">Figuratively speaking.</font>

613
00:37:44,395 --> 00:37:47,376
<font color="#ff00ff">My mother and I... She doesn't like me.</font>

614
00:37:48,732 --> 00:37:52,874
<font color="#ff00ff">She doesn't care what happens to me,
so she must want something.</font>

615
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:55,277
<font color="#ff00ff">She didn't call to see how I'm doing.</font>

616
00:37:56,207 --> 00:37:59,518
<font color="#ff00ff">What did you do
to make her not like you?</font>

617
00:38:00,911 --> 00:38:04,017
<font color="#ff00ff">Did you want to buy another mom
with your pocket money?</font>

618
00:38:04,648 --> 00:38:05,718
<font color="#ff00ff">No.</font>

619
00:38:06,584 --> 00:38:07,722
<font color="#ff00ff">I was born.</font>

620
00:38:08,085 --> 00:38:10,190
<font color="#ff00ff">Big mistake.
One should never be born.</font>

621
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:14,091
<font color="#ff00ff">If she put you in boarding school,
she must've had problems.</font>

622
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:19,540
<font color="#ff00ff">A mother always loves her children,
one way or another.</font>

623
00:38:21,332 --> 00:38:22,436
<font color="#ff00ff">Not mine.</font>

624
00:38:23,234 --> 00:38:24,440
<font color="#ff00ff">MY Zipper.</font>

625
00:38:27,271 --> 00:38:28,875
<font color="#ff00ff">You should call her back.</font>

626
00:38:29,073 --> 00:38:30,313
<font color="#ff00ff">Thank you.</font>

627
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:36,989
<font color="#ff00ff">- Why are you getting dressed?
- I'm going out.</font>

628
00:38:37,915 --> 00:38:40,225
<font color="#ff00ff">I forgot!
I met someone at Remy's place.</font>

629
00:38:40,417 --> 00:38:41,589
<font color="#ff00ff">A good-looking guy.</font>

630
00:38:41,785 --> 00:38:44,265
<font color="#ff00ff">He's got a fabulous
clothing store downtown.</font>

631
00:38:44,455 --> 00:38:46,162
<font color="#ff00ff">I thought you could babysit...</font>

632
00:38:46,690 --> 00:38:48,567
<font color="#ff00ff">I won't be late, I promise.</font>

633
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:55,406
<font color="#ff00ff">Didn't you say
that love was over for you?</font>

634
00:38:56,133 --> 00:38:57,407
<font color="#ff00ff">Men...</font>

635
00:38:58,002 --> 00:38:59,811
<font color="#ff00ff">I said love, not sex.</font>

636
00:39:00,371 --> 00:39:02,351
<font color="#ff00ff">I have physical needs.
I'm not a nun.</font>

637
00:39:07,278 --> 00:39:08,484
<font color="#ff00ff">Paul-Andre!</font>

638
00:39:09,046 --> 00:39:10,320
<font color="#ff00ff">My story!</font>

639
00:39:27,464 --> 00:39:28,875
<font color="#ff00ff">Paul-Andre!</font>

640
00:39:29,366 --> 00:39:30,538
<font color="#ff00ff">Paul-Andre?</font>

641
00:39:34,071 --> 00:39:35,482
<font color="#ff00ff">I'm afraid.</font>

642
00:39:36,307 --> 00:39:37,217
<font color="#ff00ff">What?</font>

643
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:40,146
<font color="#ff00ff">Can I get in bed with you?</font>

644
00:39:42,479 --> 00:39:44,288
<font color="#ff00ff">Yes, ok.</font>

645
00:39:48,085 --> 00:39:49,894
<font color="#ff00ff">Mom isn't home yet?</font>

646
00:39:50,521 --> 00:39:52,728
<font color="#ff00ff">No. She's doing the grocery shopping.</font>

647
00:39:52,923 --> 00:39:53,799
<font color="#ff00ff">At night?</font>

648
00:39:56,327 --> 00:39:57,738
<font color="#ff00ff">Are you alright?</font>

649
00:40:54,985 --> 00:40:56,794
<font color="#ff00ff">- I'm late!
-I don't care!</font>

650
00:40:56,987 --> 00:40:58,432
<font color="#ff00ff">- Clear off the table!
- No!</font>

651
00:40:58,622 --> 00:41:01,603
<font color="#ff00ff">- Shut up and do what I say, ok?
- Thanks a lot!</font>

652
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:03,934
<font color="#ff00ff">I do everything around here!</font>

653
00:41:04,762 --> 00:41:05,638
<font color="#ff00ff">I've had it!</font>

654
00:41:05,829 --> 00:41:08,537
<font color="#ff00ff">Are you still planning on
doing the shopping?</font>

655
00:41:08,732 --> 00:41:11,542
<font color="#ff00ff">The shopping?
Oh no, I forgot to tell you...</font>

656
00:41:12,102 --> 00:41:13,308
<font color="#ff00ff">I might've found a job.</font>

657
00:41:13,504 --> 00:41:16,383
<font color="#ff00ff">You know, the guy from last night.</font>

658
00:41:16,573 --> 00:41:18,883
<font color="#ff00ff">I'm doing atrial period in his shop.</font>

659
00:41:19,443 --> 00:41:21,787
<font color="#ff00ff">We're still doing
the shopping, aren't we?</font>

660
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:23,318
<font color="#ff00ff">The shopping--</font>

661
00:41:23,514 --> 00:41:25,084
<font color="#ff00ff">I can't find my keys.</font>

662
00:41:25,282 --> 00:41:26,955
<font color="#ff00ff">The shopping?</font>

663
00:41:28,318 --> 00:41:32,164
<font color="#ff00ff">No, later on
I have to stop by Aunt Giselle's.</font>

664
00:41:32,623 --> 00:41:33,658
<font color="#ff00ff">Hang on.</font>

665
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:36,266
<font color="#ff00ff">Here they are!</font>

666
00:41:36,927 --> 00:41:38,304
<font color="#ff00ff">Yes, Aunt Giselle.</font>

667
00:41:38,495 --> 00:41:41,339
<font color="#ff00ff">You'll meet her at the picnic
this weekend.</font>

668
00:41:41,532 --> 00:41:42,340
<font color="#ff00ff">Oh yeah?</font>

669
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,736
<font color="#ff00ff">Here's the shopping list.</font>

670
00:41:44,935 --> 00:41:46,471
<font color="#ff00ff">I thought that maybe...</font>

671
00:41:46,937 --> 00:41:49,008
<font color="#ff00ff">We need some fat-free plain yogurt,</font>

672
00:41:49,707 --> 00:41:52,119
<font color="#ff00ff">low fat milk,
macaroni and grated cheese.</font>

673
00:41:52,509 --> 00:41:54,318
<font color="#ff00ff">- Ok.
-Thanks.</font>

674
00:41:54,511 --> 00:41:56,491
<font color="#ff00ff">Kids, are you ready to go?</font>

675
00:41:57,314 --> 00:41:58,349
<font color="#ff00ff">Goodbye.</font>

676
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:00,594
<font color="#ff00ff">Goodbye, sweetheart.</font>

677
00:42:03,487 --> 00:42:05,262
<font color="#ff00ff">- Come on.
- See you tonight.</font>

678
00:42:09,993 --> 00:42:13,099
<font color="#ff00ff">- Do you have to sulk every morning?
-Leave me alone!</font>

679
00:43:31,141 --> 00:43:33,052
<font color="#ff00ff">Who cleaned up my room?</font>

680
00:43:33,243 --> 00:43:36,520
<font color="#ff00ff">My room is mine, it's off limits.
No one comes in!</font>

681
00:43:36,713 --> 00:43:39,216
<font color="#ff00ff">Is that so hard to understand,
Mr. Genius?</font>

682
00:43:42,786 --> 00:43:45,130
<font color="#ff00ff">Where's the ruler for the bisectors?</font>

683
00:43:47,925 --> 00:43:50,132
<font color="#ff00ff">- Right hand drawer.
- His room too?</font>

684
00:43:50,327 --> 00:43:53,399
<font color="#ff00ff">- You're crazy, you messed up...
-I cleaned up!</font>

685
00:43:54,598 --> 00:43:56,578
<font color="#ff00ff">I cleaned up. Alright?</font>

686
00:43:56,767 --> 00:43:57,939
<font color="#ff00ff">What is this?</font>

687
00:43:58,135 --> 00:43:59,876
<font color="#ff00ff">The law of the jungle?</font>

688
00:44:01,638 --> 00:44:05,142
<font color="#ff00ff">I wanted to find out, now I know.
It's the law of the jungle.</font>

689
00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:08,481
<font color="#ff00ff">Even family is the law of the jungle!</font>

690
00:44:12,516 --> 00:44:13,722
<font color="#ff00ff">We're all...</font>

691
00:44:15,118 --> 00:44:16,222
<font color="#ff00ff">We're...</font>

692
00:44:18,088 --> 00:44:20,068
<font color="#ff00ff">We're all alone, is that it?</font>

693
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:25,431
<font color="#ff00ff">All I did was clean up.</font>

694
00:44:45,716 --> 00:44:47,525
<font color="#ff00ff">The guy was an asshole.</font>

695
00:44:48,118 --> 00:44:50,029
<font color="#ff00ff">He just wanted to use me.</font>

696
00:44:51,622 --> 00:44:54,364
<font color="#ff00ff">I don't deserve this!
Who do they think they are?</font>

697
00:44:55,626 --> 00:44:56,764
<font color="#ff00ff">But...</font>

698
00:45:01,198 --> 00:45:04,179
<font color="#ff00ff">How did he use you?</font>

699
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:06,939
<font color="#ff00ff">He wouldn't pay me for my trial period!</font>

700
00:45:07,137 --> 00:45:07,979
<font color="#ff00ff">That's how.</font>

701
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:13,019
<font color="#ff00ff">You agree with me, right?
He's using me.</font>

702
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:16,650
<font color="#ff00ff">First he sleeps with me,
then he won't pay me for working?</font>

703
00:45:17,347 --> 00:45:18,792
<font color="#ff00ff">On the other hand...</font>

704
00:45:18,982 --> 00:45:20,620
<font color="#ff00ff">you wanted to...</font>

705
00:45:21,151 --> 00:45:22,789
<font color="#ff00ff">sleep with him too, right?</font>

706
00:45:25,555 --> 00:45:27,535
<font color="#ff00ff">- Would you have done that?
-What?</font>

707
00:45:27,724 --> 00:45:29,897
<font color="#ff00ff">Not pay you or sleep with you?</font>

708
00:45:30,494 --> 00:45:31,495
<font color="#ff00ff">Both.</font>

709
00:45:33,497 --> 00:45:34,999
<font color="#ff00ff">No. Neither one.</font>

710
00:45:35,198 --> 00:45:37,178
<font color="#ff00ff">There you go!</font>

711
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:40,746
<font color="#ff00ff">- I feel so ashamed.
- Don't.</font>

712
00:45:40,938 --> 00:45:44,545
<font color="#ff00ff">I'm ashamed of this stupid game
we're playing.</font>

713
00:45:44,741 --> 00:45:47,312
<font color="#ff00ff">But the truth is, I can't do it alone.</font>

714
00:45:47,511 --> 00:45:48,683
<font color="#ff00ff">I can't cope.</font>

715
00:45:48,879 --> 00:45:51,553
<font color="#ff00ff">- For now...
- No, I'll never be able to!</font>

716
00:45:52,282 --> 00:45:56,162
<font color="#ff00ff">You're giving me a break
and then what? It'll be hell all over.</font>

717
00:46:00,123 --> 00:46:02,831
<font color="#ff00ff">You know what I feel like?
Like a whore.</font>

718
00:46:03,026 --> 00:46:05,267
<font color="#ff00ff">You like being part of a whore's family?</font>

719
00:46:11,034 --> 00:46:12,206
<font color="#ff00ff">What's that?</font>

720
00:46:20,811 --> 00:46:22,119
<font color="#ff00ff">It's for me?</font>

721
00:46:25,482 --> 00:46:27,428
<font color="#ff00ff">You don't give ?owers to a whore.</font>

722
00:46:42,833 --> 00:46:45,404
<font color="#ff00ff">Remy, put the tablecloth down!</font>

723
00:46:45,602 --> 00:46:46,273
<font color="#ff00ff">Need a hand?</font>

724
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:50,418
<font color="#ff00ff">- Who have you met so far?
- Fabian. The driving instructor.</font>

725
00:46:50,607 --> 00:46:52,609

-Yes.</font>

726
00:46:52,809 --> 00:46:54,550
<font color="#ff00ff">- Did you see his kids?
-Yes.</font>

727
00:46:54,745 --> 00:46:56,884
<font color="#ff00ff">- Who made that?
-I did.</font>

728
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:58,889
<font color="#ff00ff">- It's fabulous.
- Oh yeah?</font>

729
00:46:59,082 --> 00:47:00,755
<font color="#ff00ff">- A caterer made it.
- No, I did.</font>

730
00:47:00,951 --> 00:47:04,057
<font color="#ff00ff">When I get bored at Remy';
I make table decorations.</font>

731
00:47:04,254 --> 00:47:06,131
<font color="#ff00ff">- Are you serious?
-Yes.</font>

732
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:08,166
<font color="#ff00ff">I think it's beautiful.</font>

733
00:47:08,358 --> 00:47:09,393
<font color="#ff00ff">It's very...</font>

734
00:47:10,027 --> 00:47:12,064
<font color="#ff00ff">- Thank you.
- It's very creative...</font>

735
00:47:12,696 --> 00:47:14,937
<font color="#ff00ff">You do it with vegetables?</font>

736
00:47:15,132 --> 00:47:17,669
<font color="#ff00ff">- Fruit or vegetables.
-Whatever comes...</font>

737
00:47:18,168 --> 00:47:19,511
<font color="#ff00ff">into your head.</font>

738
00:47:21,104 --> 00:47:24,017
<font color="#ff00ff">Violet's dream job
wasn't particularly glamorous!</font>

739
00:47:25,475 --> 00:47:27,978
<font color="#ff00ff">- Remy, come on!
- Listen to this...</font>

740
00:47:28,378 --> 00:47:30,585
<font color="#ff00ff">When I was about</font>

741
00:47:30,781 --> 00:47:34,695
<font color="#ff00ff">18 and she was 14,
you know what she wanted to be?</font>

742
00:47:35,052 --> 00:47:36,929
<font color="#ff00ff">Get this!</font>

743
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:40,927
<font color="#ff00ff">She wanted to be a personal assistant.</font>

744
00:47:41,124 --> 00:47:43,832
<font color="#ff00ff">We sure had fun teasing her about that!</font>

745
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:48,373
<font color="#ff00ff">Sorry, but that was my dream.</font>

746
00:47:48,565 --> 00:47:52,172
<font color="#ff00ff">I knew it was silly because
I'm not smart, but I loved the idea.</font>

747
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:55,612
<font color="#ff00ff">It must've been
because of our neighbor, Mrs. Jouve.</font>

748
00:47:55,806 --> 00:47:57,012
<font color="#ff00ff">Mrs. Jouve!</font>

749
00:47:57,207 --> 00:47:59,153
<font color="#ff00ff">Mrs. Jouve, she was hot!</font>

750
00:47:59,342 --> 00:48:00,218
<font color="#ff00ff">Watch it!</font>

751
00:48:00,410 --> 00:48:03,289
<font color="#ff00ff">I loved watching her
leave for work in the morning,</font>

752
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:06,689
<font color="#ff00ff">with her high heels clicking
and super elegant suits.</font>

753
00:48:06,883 --> 00:48:07,827
<font color="#ff00ff">That's right.</font>

754
00:48:08,018 --> 00:48:10,726
<font color="#ff00ff">And when Dad saw her,
he'd always say:</font>

755
00:48:11,188 --> 00:48:13,293
<font color="#ff00ff">"Now that's a woman who has class."</font>

756
00:48:14,391 --> 00:48:16,234
<font color="#ff00ff">it was real nice for Morn.</font>

757
00:48:17,694 --> 00:48:20,800
<font color="#ff00ff">Don't you need to speak English
to be a PA?</font>

758
00:48:20,997 --> 00:48:21,975
<font color="#ff00ff">Yes, of course.</font>

759
00:48:22,165 --> 00:48:23,667
<font color="#ff00ff">Not to mention spelling!</font>

760
00:48:23,867 --> 00:48:26,404
<font color="#ff00ff">Because Violet,
when it comes to spelling...</font>

761
00:48:27,437 --> 00:48:30,384
<font color="#ff00ff">I'm dyslexic. It's not my fault!</font>

762
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:32,918
<font color="#ff00ff">All she cared about was boys.</font>

763
00:48:33,110 --> 00:48:34,487
<font color="#ff00ff">Isn't that right, Violet?</font>

764
00:48:34,678 --> 00:48:37,887
<font color="#ff00ff">- Boys were easier than spelling.
-And you were more talented!</font>

765
00:48:39,616 --> 00:48:42,995
<font color="#ff00ff">Yeah, you sure weren't dyslexic
when it came to boys!</font>

766
00:48:43,186 --> 00:48:44,529
<font color="#ff00ff">That was low!</font>

767
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:48,535
<font color="#ff00ff">Come on, it's true.</font>

768
00:48:48,725 --> 00:48:50,204
<font color="#ff00ff">We're just joking.</font>

769
00:48:50,393 --> 00:48:53,602
<font color="#ff00ff">Julie was meant to be a hostess.
Weren't you, love?</font>

770
00:48:56,766 --> 00:48:59,610
<font color="#ff00ff">I wanted to be a hostess
ever since I was little.</font>

771
00:49:01,037 --> 00:49:03,449
<font color="#ff00ff">That's different, that's classy.</font>

772
00:49:04,241 --> 00:49:07,552
<font color="#ff00ff">Dad always said
"without class you're nothing."</font>

773
00:49:07,744 --> 00:49:10,224
<font color="#ff00ff">You either have it or you don't.</font>

774
00:49:10,413 --> 00:49:13,087
<font color="#ff00ff">And Violet, you don't.</font>

775
00:49:14,151 --> 00:49:15,221
<font color="#ff00ff">And you do?</font>

776
00:49:15,418 --> 00:49:18,524
<font color="#ff00ff">No way! It runs in the family,
we got no class.</font>

777
00:49:18,722 --> 00:49:19,860
<font color="#ff00ff">Excuse me.</font>

778
00:49:20,490 --> 00:49:21,867
<font color="#ff00ff">- Excuse me.
-Yeah?</font>

779
00:49:23,226 --> 00:49:24,534
<font color="#ff00ff">I think...</font>

780
00:49:25,128 --> 00:49:26,436
<font color="#ff00ff">lf I may say so...</font>

781
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:30,373
<font color="#ff00ff">Violet is enthusiastic.
She's cheerful, she's kind...</font>

782
00:49:31,067 --> 00:49:33,809
<font color="#ff00ff">she's curious and people like her.</font>

783
00:49:34,004 --> 00:49:35,711
<font color="#ff00ff">Contrary to what you say,</font>

784
00:49:35,906 --> 00:49:39,046
<font color="#ff00ff">I think she'd make
an excellent personal assistant.</font>

785
00:49:39,242 --> 00:49:41,620
<font color="#ff00ff">Hey, we were joking.
Joking, you hear?</font>

786
00:49:41,811 --> 00:49:44,314
<font color="#ff00ff">It's our way of having fun.</font>

787
00:49:44,514 --> 00:49:45,322
<font color="#ff00ff">No.</font>

788
00:49:45,982 --> 00:49:47,484
<font color="#ff00ff">No, you're not joking.</font>

789
00:49:48,585 --> 00:49:51,156
<font color="#ff00ff">How do expect her to have confidence</font>

790
00:49:51,354 --> 00:49:54,301
<font color="#ff00ff">when all you do
is knock down everything she does?</font>

791
00:49:55,792 --> 00:49:57,169
<font color="#ff00ff">They have the right to talk.</font>

792
00:49:57,360 --> 00:49:59,067
<font color="#ff00ff">You can't let these no-hopers...</font>

793
00:49:59,262 --> 00:50:02,766
<font color="#ff00ff">Don't you insult my family!
You're no better than anyone here.</font>

794
00:50:02,966 --> 00:50:04,240
<font color="#ff00ff">That's for sure.</font>

795
00:50:06,469 --> 00:50:09,006
<font color="#ff00ff">- It's...
- Don't insult my family!</font>

796
00:50:10,974 --> 00:50:12,282
<font color="#ff00ff">It's them...</font>

798
00:50:17,881 --> 00:50:19,622

799
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:24,828
<font color="#ff00ff">Excuse me.</font>

800
00:50:36,233 --> 00:50:39,009
<font color="#ff00ff">- My, my.
-Where'd you find this one?</font>

801
00:50:54,217 --> 00:50:57,960
<font color="#ff00ff">For the picnic next week,
could we go to Chateaugrand instead?</font>

802
00:50:58,488 --> 00:51:00,991
<font color="#ff00ff">Nina lives close by. I could invite her.</font>

803
00:51:02,993 --> 00:51:04,870
<font color="#ff00ff">- Next week?
- We'll see.</font>

804
00:51:05,929 --> 00:51:09,741
<font color="#ff00ff">You're not having
another picnic next week?</font>

805
00:51:09,933 --> 00:51:13,312
<font color="#ff00ff">We have picnics every week!
That's what family's about.</font>

806
00:51:13,737 --> 00:51:17,583
<font color="#ff00ff">Thank god. Can you imagine us four
alone all weekend?</font>

807
00:51:21,378 --> 00:51:25,690
<font color="#ff00ff">Instead of picnicking each weekend,
we might consider a concert</font>

808
00:51:25,882 --> 00:51:28,658
<font color="#ff00ff">or a museum exhibition.</font>

809
00:51:28,852 --> 00:51:29,728
<font color="#ff00ff">What?</font>

810
00:51:29,919 --> 00:51:33,492
<font color="#ff00ff">I said I will not attend
a family picnic every weekend!</font>

811

<font color="#ff00ff">You're a pain in the neck!
You all are!</font>

812
00:51:40,130 --> 00:51:41,108
<font color="#ff00ff">I want to get out.</font>

00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:46,111
<font color="#ff00ff">- Calm down.
- No, I'm getting out.</font>

815
00:51:46,536 --> 00:51:49,210
<font color="#ff00ff">Please, I want to get out.
Stop the car!</font>

816
00:52:01,484 --> 00:52:04,624
<font color="#ff00ff">What did I say?
It's been along day, everyone's tired.</font>

817
00:52:04,821 --> 00:52:06,198
<font color="#ff00ff">Don't shit a brick!</font>

818
00:52:06,589 --> 00:52:08,125
<font color="#ff00ff">Very elegant! Bravo!</font>

819
00:52:08,325 --> 00:52:09,599
<font color="#ff00ff">What's your problem?</font>

820
00:52:09,793 --> 00:52:12,967
<font color="#ff00ff">Picnics? Errands? The mess?
You just don't like family!</font>

821
00:52:13,163 --> 00:52:17,612
<font color="#ff00ff">When you talked about family,
you said "haven of peace" and "harmony."</font>

822
00:52:19,336 --> 00:52:21,543
<font color="#ff00ff">- "Human exchanges!"
-I said that?</font>

823
00:52:21,738 --> 00:52:25,049
<font color="#ff00ff">I listened to your interview again.
You spoke of comfort...</font>

824
00:52:25,241 --> 00:52:27,881
<font color="#ff00ff">"Without my family's love,
I'd be a booming gong..."</font>

825
00:52:28,078 --> 00:52:30,888
<font color="#ff00ff">But all you do is shout. Shout!</font>

826
00:52:31,081 --> 00:52:35,223
<font color="#ff00ff">Like before my father left,
all they did was shout.</font>

827
00:52:35,418 --> 00:52:37,796
<font color="#ff00ff">Shouting from morning to night!</font>

828
00:52:37,987 --> 00:52:39,933
<font color="#ff00ff">That's what family's about,
shouting!</font>

829
00:52:40,790 --> 00:52:42,963
<font color="#ff00ff">- You like when I kiss you.
-Yes. I mean no!</font>

830
00:52:43,159 --> 00:52:45,230
<font color="#ff00ff">No, because it's fake.</font>

831
00:52:45,428 --> 00:52:47,908
<font color="#ff00ff">- But you like Auguste for real?
-Yes.</font>

832
00:52:48,531 --> 00:52:50,067
<font color="#ff00ff">You're not going to stop?</font>

833
00:52:50,266 --> 00:52:53,406
<font color="#ff00ff">Listen, it's networking out.
It was a very bad idea.</font>

834
00:52:53,603 --> 00:52:55,674
<font color="#ff00ff">It's nothing but chaos.</font>

835
00:52:56,940 --> 00:52:58,317
<font color="#ff00ff">You're going to leave?</font>

836
00:52:58,808 --> 00:53:00,617
<font color="#ff00ff">I think it's the best thing to do.</font>

837
00:53:00,810 --> 00:53:02,118
<font color="#ff00ff">And what about me?</font>

838
00:53:02,312 --> 00:53:04,349
<font color="#ff00ff">I settled your debts.</font>

839
00:53:04,547 --> 00:53:05,423
<font color="#ff00ff">So...</font>

840
00:53:06,549 --> 00:53:09,029
<font color="#ff00ff">What about the one year's wages?</font>

841
00:53:09,652 --> 00:53:12,155
<font color="#ff00ff">There was a two-week trial period.</font>

842
00:53:12,355 --> 00:53:13,595
<font color="#ff00ff">- There was?
-Yes.</font>

843
00:53:13,790 --> 00:53:16,361
<font color="#ff00ff">I didn't see that.
It was really written tiny.</font>

844
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:19,199
<font color="#ff00ff">Look for yourself. It's in the contract.</font>

845
00:53:19,396 --> 00:53:21,137
<font color="#ff00ff">You know what I think?</font>

846
00:53:21,331 --> 00:53:24,710
<font color="#ff00ff">I think you watched
"Little House on the Prairie" too much!</font>

847
00:53:24,901 --> 00:53:28,872
<font color="#ff00ff">You're no more mature than Auguste!
Your family fantasy is infantile!</font>

848
00:53:29,072 --> 00:53:32,815
<font color="#ff00ff">- So goodbye. I've had it too!
- Do you want a man or not?</font>

849
00:53:33,343 --> 00:53:34,822
<font color="#ff00ff">Make up your mind!</font>

850
00:53:44,387 --> 00:53:45,559
<font color="#ff00ff">Violet...</font>

851
00:54:03,573 --> 00:54:05,519
<font color="#ff00ff">I'm happy to see you again, boss.</font>

852
00:54:28,531 --> 00:54:31,444
<font color="#ff00ff">I was thinking,
we could buy something else.</font>

853
00:54:32,969 --> 00:54:36,075
<font color="#ff00ff">A while back,
you were thinking of an airplane.</font>

854
00:54:36,272 --> 00:54:38,616
<font color="#ff00ff">But how about a zeppelin?</font>

855
00:54:41,578 --> 00:54:43,353
<font color="#ff00ff">I like the idea of a zeppelin.</font>

856
00:54:45,715 --> 00:54:47,626
<font color="#ff00ff">Zeppelins catch fire.</font>

857
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:52,458
<font color="#ff00ff">You're not going to...</font>

858
00:54:53,923 --> 00:54:55,925
<font color="#ff00ff">You're not going to relapse, boss?</font>

859
00:54:56,125 --> 00:54:58,435
<font color="#ff00ff">You haven't been out in three weeks.</font>

860
00:55:04,133 --> 00:55:05,441
<font color="#ff00ff">I think...</font>

861
00:55:08,505 --> 00:55:10,576
<font color="#ff00ff">This isn't easy to say, but...</font>

862
00:55:11,641 --> 00:55:13,484
<font color="#ff00ff">I might have a hypothesis.</font>

863
00:55:16,613 --> 00:55:18,957
<font color="#ff00ff">Maybe you miss
Violet and the children.</font>

864
00:55:20,750 --> 00:55:21,626
<font color="#ff00ff">No.</font>

865
00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:24,291
<font color="#ff00ff">But...</font>

866
00:55:24,487 --> 00:55:27,593
<font color="#ff00ff">Maybe it's up to you
to take things in hand.</font>

867
00:55:28,591 --> 00:55:29,501
<font color="#ff00ff">Meaning?</font>

868
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:32,439
<font color="#ff00ff">To return as head of the family.</font>

869
00:55:33,196 --> 00:55:36,006
<font color="#ff00ff">You're the one who's paying,
you make the rules.</font>

870
00:55:36,833 --> 00:55:37,937
<font color="#ff00ff">It's...</font>

871
00:55:40,837 --> 00:55:42,316
<font color="#ff00ff">Head of the family?</font>

872
00:55:42,505 --> 00:55:46,078
<font color="#ff00ff">You lay down the law!
You impose your concept of the world.</font>

873
00:55:46,276 --> 00:55:48,187
<font color="#ff00ff">You set the pace.</font>

874
00:55:55,885 --> 00:56:00,698
<font color="#ff00ff">We got off to a bad start,
so I've decided to set things straight.</font>

875
00:56:00,890 --> 00:56:02,528
<font color="#ff00ff">Anything left lying around</font>

876
00:56:02,725 --> 00:56:05,501
<font color="#ff00ff">will be picked up
by he who left it lying around.</font>

877
00:56:06,629 --> 00:56:08,870
<font color="#ff00ff">Auguste, you know what
I'm talking about?</font>

878
00:56:10,233 --> 00:56:11,769
<font color="#ff00ff">We listen to each other.</font>

879
00:56:11,968 --> 00:56:14,141
<font color="#ff00ff">We talk to each other.
We're a family.</font>

880
00:56:14,871 --> 00:56:15,781
<font color="#ff00ff">Ok?</font>

881
00:56:16,372 --> 00:56:17,817
<font color="#ff00ff">As for pocket money...</font>

882
00:56:18,575 --> 00:56:21,784
<font color="#ff00ff">I thought 200 euros a week,</font>

883
00:56:21,978 --> 00:56:24,049
<font color="#ff00ff">not a penny more, would be quite...</font>

884
00:56:25,548 --> 00:56:28,529
<font color="#ff00ff">Maybe 100 euros.
We'll see about that later.</font>

885
00:56:29,085 --> 00:56:29,995
<font color="#ff00ff">Whatever the case,</font>

886
00:56:30,186 --> 00:56:33,326
<font color="#ff00ff">if you have any remarks to make,
which would be normal,</font>

887
00:56:33,556 --> 00:56:37,470
<font color="#ff00ff">a little box, which I shall make myself,
will be put at your disposal.</font>

888
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:41,403
<font color="#ff00ff">You'll put your remarks inside
-no spelling mistakes allowed -</font>

889
00:56:41,598 --> 00:56:45,512
<font color="#ff00ff">and they will be considered in due time
as is appropriate.</font>

890
00:56:45,768 --> 00:56:46,678
<font color="#ff00ff">There you go.</font>

891
00:56:47,604 --> 00:56:48,878
<font color="#ff00ff">Everything clear?</font>

892
00:56:49,572 --> 00:56:51,813
<font color="#ff00ff">So you couldn't live without me?</font>

893
00:56:52,008 --> 00:56:53,043
<font color="#ff00ff">Not at all.</font>

894
00:56:53,776 --> 00:56:55,722
<font color="#ff00ff">It was a question of honesty.</font>

895
00:56:55,912 --> 00:56:57,858
<font color="#ff00ff">I wanted to respect the contract.</font>

896
00:56:58,881 --> 00:57:01,521
<font color="#ff00ff">It's really great that you came back,</font>

897
00:57:01,718 --> 00:57:04,824
<font color="#ff00ff">but when it comes to raising the kids,
that's my job.</font>

898
00:57:05,021 --> 00:57:07,934
<font color="#ff00ff">Yes, but if I'm going to stay
for two more months,</font>

899
00:57:08,124 --> 00:57:10,934
<font color="#ff00ff">they're my responsibility
for two more months.</font>

900
00:57:11,127 --> 00:57:12,037
<font color="#ff00ff">Therefore, I am...</font>

901
00:57:12,462 --> 00:57:13,941
<font color="#ff00ff">the head of the family.</font>

902
00:57:16,065 --> 00:57:17,544
<font color="#ff00ff">I'm not used to that.</font>

903
00:57:18,267 --> 00:57:19,439
<font color="#ff00ff">Me either.</font>

904
00:57:27,410 --> 00:57:29,083
<font color="#ff00ff">Are you going out?</font>

905
00:57:29,278 --> 00:57:30,780
<font color="#ff00ff">Yes, I have a date.</font>

906
00:57:32,615 --> 00:57:33,719
<font color="#ff00ff">Nth...</font>

907
00:57:34,717 --> 00:57:35,525
<font color="#ff00ff">a man?</font>

908
00:57:35,718 --> 00:57:36,924
<font color="#ff00ff">Yes.</font>

909
00:57:38,888 --> 00:57:39,696
<font color="#ff00ff">No.</font>

910
00:57:40,223 --> 00:57:41,224
<font color="#ff00ff">No what?</font>

911
00:57:42,992 --> 00:57:43,936
<font color="#ff00ff">No.</font>

912
00:57:48,297 --> 00:57:50,777
<font color="#ff00ff">I understand
you want to take things in hand</font>

913
00:57:50,967 --> 00:57:52,776
<font color="#ff00ff">and you're doing a good job.</font>

914
00:57:53,403 --> 00:57:55,212
<font color="#ff00ff">But this isn't about the family.</font>

915
00:57:55,405 --> 00:57:57,248
<font color="#ff00ff">Could you help me?</font>

916
00:57:58,074 --> 00:57:59,553
<font color="#ff00ff">This is about...</font>

917
00:58:00,076 --> 00:58:02,454
<font color="#ff00ff">how can I put it... my personal life.</font>

918
00:58:02,645 --> 00:58:05,057
<font color="#ff00ff">I'm free,
it's written in the contract.</font>

919
00:58:05,682 --> 00:58:08,458
<font color="#ff00ff">You don't want to see my family,</font>

920
00:58:08,651 --> 00:58:10,460
<font color="#ff00ff">so if I can't see my friends...</font>

921
00:58:12,755 --> 00:58:14,325
<font color="#ff00ff">Yes, but I paid.</font>

922
00:58:15,291 --> 00:58:16,964
<font color="#ff00ff">Yes, but...</font>

923
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:18,639
<font color="#ff00ff">it was very clear that...</font>

924
00:58:18,828 --> 00:58:20,603
<font color="#ff00ff">I don't know about you,</font>

925
00:58:20,797 --> 00:58:22,470
<font color="#ff00ff">but I need to live.</font>

926
00:58:22,665 --> 00:58:26,010
<font color="#ff00ff">I can't hang around here
standing to attention.</font>

927
00:58:26,202 --> 00:58:27,840
<font color="#ff00ff">Not even for two days.</font>

928
00:58:28,037 --> 00:58:29,641
<font color="#ff00ff">It's impossible.</font>

929
00:58:30,273 --> 00:58:32,116
<font color="#ff00ff">So two months, forget it.</font>

930
00:58:35,178 --> 00:58:37,658
<font color="#ff00ff">I'm not asking for much, you know.</font>

931
00:58:37,847 --> 00:58:39,485
<font color="#ff00ff">I just want to go out...</font>

932
00:58:39,982 --> 00:58:41,427
<font color="#ff00ff">see people...</font>

933
00:58:41,617 --> 00:58:42,755
<font color="#ff00ff">go dancing!</font>

934
00:58:44,187 --> 00:58:45,825
<font color="#ff00ff">Maybe meet someone.</font>

935
00:58:49,459 --> 00:58:53,703
<font color="#ff00ff">I don't know how you manage,
but I couldn't stay that long without...</font>

936
00:58:57,467 --> 00:58:59,140
<font color="#ff00ff">without making love.</font>

937
00:58:59,836 --> 00:59:02,180
<font color="#ff00ff">And we're not going to make love.</font>

938
00:59:05,074 --> 00:59:07,452
<font color="#ff00ff">It wasn't stipulated in the contract.</font>

939
00:59:11,481 --> 00:59:12,459
<font color="#ff00ff">There you go.</font>

940
00:59:12,915 --> 00:59:16,488
<font color="#ff00ff">There's not a single book
that can replace that.</font>

941
00:59:17,086 --> 00:59:18,622
<font color="#ff00ff">Try it, you'll see.</font>

942
00:59:22,225 --> 00:59:26,332
<font color="#ff00ff">Could you say that again?
"it wasn't stipulated in the contract."</font>

943
00:59:27,864 --> 00:59:30,037
<font color="#ff00ff">It wasn't stipulated in the contract.</font>

944
00:59:40,843 --> 00:59:44,518
<font color="#ff00ff">I don't know why,
but it really turns me on.</font>

945
00:59:49,786 --> 00:59:51,595
<font color="#ff00ff">Wait a second.</font>

946
01:00:48,411 --> 01:00:49,481

<font color="#ff00ff">To be honest, I haven't had time
to think about it.</font>

958

<font color="#ff00ff">To Giselle's.
Her cleaning lady is off for the week.</font>

961

for a few hours.</font>

976
01:02:39,956 --> 01:02:41,526
<font color="#ff00ff">And we'd made plans.</font>

977
01:02:41,724 --> 01:02:45,194

Do I have to call for an appointment?</font>

for a while.</font>

981
01:03:00,409 --> 01:03:03,117

We said we'd go grocery shopping.</font>

to your mother's rather than the picnic.</font>

on the way to your mother's?</font>

993
01:04:46,682 --> 01:04:48,184

like when we were kids?</font>

Her children are my responsibility.</font>

1078
01:10:17,179 --> 01:10:18,351
<font color="#ff00ff">Excuse me?</font>

1079
01:10:19,815 --> 01:10:22,489
<font color="#ff00ff">Her children are my responsibility,
Mother!</font>

1080
01:10:23,318 --> 01:10:25,457
<font color="#ff00ff">I certainly hope it's temporary.</font>

1081
01:10:32,895 --> 01:10:35,501
<font color="#ff00ff">I put him in a very strict
boarding school</font>

1082
01:10:35,697 --> 01:10:37,404
<font color="#ff00ff">for family reasons.</font>

1083
01:10:38,167 --> 01:10:42,138
<font color="#ff00ff">I must admit, it didn't help him
become independent.</font>

1084
01:10:42,771 --> 01:10:44,182
<font color="#ff00ff">We are the way we are.</font>

1085
01:10:45,207 --> 01:10:46,379
<font color="#ff00ff">It's a goal!</font>

1086
01:10:48,377 --> 01:10:50,015
<font color="#ff00ff">What's that child doing!</font>

1087
01:10:50,746 --> 01:10:52,748
<font color="#ff00ff">Hey you!
Watch out for my ?owers!</font>

1088
01:10:54,016 --> 01:10:56,496
<font color="#ff00ff">- Auguste!
- I've got it under control!</font>

1089
01:10:56,685 --> 01:10:59,666
<font color="#ff00ff">Responsible for a family...
That takes the cake!</font>

1090
01:11:00,856 --> 01:11:05,100
<font color="#ff00ff">Paul-Andre loved playing mommy and daddy
with Sandra when he was little.</font>

1091
01:11:06,228 --> 01:11:10,108
<font color="#ff00ff">They were this close to marrying!
I'll never understand what happened.</font>

1092
01:11:11,934 --> 01:11:14,505
<font color="#ff00ff">Now they're both alone, like me.</font>

1093
01:11:15,971 --> 01:11:18,781
<font color="#ff00ff">Paul-Andre needs a strong woman</font>

1094
01:11:18,974 --> 01:11:21,580
<font color="#ff00ff">who can take care of him.</font>

1095
01:11:22,377 --> 01:11:24,118
<font color="#ff00ff">An independent woman.</font>

1096
01:11:24,613 --> 01:11:26,217
<font color="#ff00ff">I'm independent.</font>

1097
01:11:27,649 --> 01:11:32,598
<font color="#ff00ff">I mean a woman who is truly his equal.</font>

1098
01:11:32,788 --> 01:11:36,235
<font color="#ff00ff">One who isn't motivated by interest,
who doesn't need money.</font>

1099
01:11:36,425 --> 01:11:37,369
<font color="#ff00ff">Mother!</font>

1100
01:11:38,894 --> 01:11:41,204
<font color="#ff00ff">Can't I talk about you?</font>

1101
01:11:41,396 --> 01:11:43,103
<font color="#ff00ff">It's not against the law.</font>

1102
01:11:52,574 --> 01:11:53,917
<font color="#ff00ff">Are you expecting company?</font>

1103
01:11:54,109 --> 01:11:54,985
<font color="#ff00ff">Mother!</font>

1104
01:11:55,811 --> 01:11:59,224
<font color="#ff00ff">Oh, it's Sandra!
She came to renew my prescription.</font>

1105
01:12:00,449 --> 01:12:02,053
<font color="#ff00ff">I have to take care of myself.</font>

1106
01:12:04,453 --> 01:12:07,400
<font color="#ff00ff">He shoots! The crowd is going wild!</font>

1107
01:12:10,192 --> 01:12:12,502
<font color="#ff00ff">I apologized, Mom. I said I was sorry.</font>

1108
01:12:12,694 --> 01:12:14,173
<font color="#ff00ff">I know, sweetheart.</font>

1109
01:12:16,798 --> 01:12:17,970
<font color="#ff00ff">Come on, Auguste.</font>

1110
01:12:18,166 --> 01:12:19,907
<font color="#ff00ff">It's nothing serious, Irene.</font>

1111
01:12:20,102 --> 01:12:21,638
<font color="#ff00ff">It'll feel hot, but that's all.</font>

1112
01:12:22,137 --> 01:12:23,514
<font color="#ff00ff">What a clumsy boy!</font>

1113
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:26,114
<font color="#ff00ff">How are you?</font>

1114
01:12:28,010 --> 01:12:29,512
<font color="#ff00ff">You haven't changed.</font>

1115
01:12:29,878 --> 01:12:31,949
<font color="#ff00ff">Thank you. You haven't either.</font>

1116
01:12:32,381 --> 01:12:33,416
<font color="#ff00ff">Thanks.</font>

1117
01:12:35,484 --> 01:12:37,623
<font color="#ff00ff">Yet if my memory serves me well,</font>

1118
01:12:37,819 --> 01:12:41,926
<font color="#ff00ff">the world has been rushing inexorably
towards disaster...</font>

1119
01:12:42,491 --> 01:12:44,334
<font color="#ff00ff">-ever since...
- The dawn of time.</font>

1120
01:12:46,228 --> 01:12:49,471
<font color="#ff00ff">- I've heard that one too.
- Daisy...</font>

1121
01:12:49,898 --> 01:12:51,206
<font color="#ff00ff">Violet.</font>

1122
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:53,507
<font color="#ff00ff">Bring me a glass of water.</font>

1123
01:12:54,369 --> 01:12:55,473
<font color="#ff00ff">Sure.</font>

1124
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:01,382
<font color="#ff00ff">- I'll get it.
-No, that's ok. I've got it.</font>

1125
01:13:07,015 --> 01:13:09,518
<font color="#ff00ff">Does nice weather still bother you?</font>

1126
01:13:10,919 --> 01:13:12,455
<font color="#ff00ff">Sometimes, yes.</font>

1127
01:13:16,892 --> 01:13:19,873
<font color="#ff00ff">You should have live-in help, Irene.</font>

1128
01:13:20,062 --> 01:13:22,303
<font color="#ff00ff">Yes, Sandra, you're right.</font>

1129
01:13:23,265 --> 01:13:26,644
<font color="#ff00ff">- Do you want me to take care of it?
- Sure. I trust you.</font>

1130
01:13:28,103 --> 01:13:28,843
<font color="#ff00ff">Here you go.</font>

1131
01:13:34,710 --> 01:13:36,212
<font color="#ff00ff">You're very welcome.</font>

1132
01:13:44,286 --> 01:13:48,063
<font color="#ff00ff">Sandra specialized in traumatology.
She's one of the best.</font>

1133
01:13:49,791 --> 01:13:51,065
<font color="#ff00ff">Traumatology?</font>

1134
01:13:51,426 --> 01:13:52,598
<font color="#ff00ff">WOW!</font>

1135
01:13:52,794 --> 01:13:53,864
<font color="#ff00ff">That's great!</font>

1136
01:13:55,030 --> 01:13:57,601
<font color="#ff00ff">What kind of patients do you treat?</font>

1137
01:13:57,799 --> 01:13:59,278
<font color="#ff00ff">Traumatized ones.</font>

1138
01:14:01,570 --> 01:14:03,743
<font color="#ff00ff">It depends.
Sometimes the elderly...</font>

1139
01:14:03,939 --> 01:14:06,215
<font color="#ff00ff">I also have a degree in sports medicine.</font>

1140
01:14:06,408 --> 01:14:09,878
<font color="#ff00ff">For the anecdote,
my last patient fractured his knee</font>

1141
01:14:10,078 --> 01:14:12,615
<font color="#ff00ff">while attempting
to escape from a police van.</font>

1142
01:14:13,615 --> 01:14:15,424
<font color="#ff00ff">I've been in a police van.</font>

1143
01:14:15,817 --> 01:14:17,057
<font color="#ff00ff">Right, Paul-Andre?</font>

1144
01:14:17,452 --> 01:14:19,796
<font color="#ff00ff">A police record
and the whole nine yards!</font>

1145
01:14:19,988 --> 01:14:21,797
<font color="#ff00ff">That's actually how we met.</font>

1146
01:14:26,261 --> 01:14:28,571
<font color="#ff00ff">A miscarriage of justice, I presume?</font>

1147
01:14:29,331 --> 01:14:33,245
<font color="#ff00ff">Nope, caught in the act.
Assault and battery against a guard.</font>

1148
01:14:33,435 --> 01:14:34,880
<font color="#ff00ff">- Against a what?
-A cop.</font>

1149
01:14:35,070 --> 01:14:37,914
<font color="#ff00ff">- Then that means you're...
- She's joking.</font>

1150
01:14:38,106 --> 01:14:39,585
<font color="#ff00ff">No, I'm not joking.</font>

1151
01:14:40,142 --> 01:14:41,951
<font color="#ff00ff">Yes, you are. You're joking.</font>

1152
01:14:44,780 --> 01:14:45,986
<font color="#ff00ff">That's right, sorry.</font>

1153
01:14:46,348 --> 01:14:48,726
<font color="#ff00ff">I'll go for a walk and stop shaming you.</font>

1154
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:52,984
<font color="#ff00ff">Are you ok?</font>

1155
01:15:53,181 --> 01:15:54,387
<font color="#ff00ff">Yes, fine.</font>

1156
01:15:56,885 --> 01:15:58,193
<font color="#ff00ff">I warned you.</font>

1157
01:15:58,854 --> 01:16:00,197
<font color="#ff00ff">She doesn't like me.</font>

1158
01:16:00,689 --> 01:16:02,669
<font color="#ff00ff">I don't know why, but it's a fact.</font>

1159
01:16:02,858 --> 01:16:04,462
<font color="#ff00ff">So it always ends badly.</font>

1160
01:16:06,261 --> 01:16:08,036
<font color="#ff00ff">Your mother's not the problem.</font>

1161
01:16:09,397 --> 01:16:10,899
<font color="#ff00ff">You're the problem.</font>

1162
01:16:12,601 --> 01:16:13,636
<font color="#ff00ff">Me?</font>

1163
01:16:14,903 --> 01:16:16,382
<font color="#ff00ff">What did I do?</font>

1164
01:16:17,405 --> 01:16:19,476
<font color="#ff00ff">You're still in love with Sandra.</font>

1165
01:16:20,175 --> 01:16:22,086
<font color="#ff00ff">Your mother knows it. She feels it.</font>

1166
01:16:23,078 --> 01:16:24,751
<font color="#ff00ff">I can see it too.</font>

1167
01:16:24,946 --> 01:16:26,721
<font color="#ff00ff">You don't need a college degree.</font>

1168
01:16:27,783 --> 01:16:29,524
<font color="#ff00ff">What are you talking about?</font>

1169
01:16:30,719 --> 01:16:32,926
<font color="#ff00ff">It's no big deal. It's the way it is.</font>

1170
01:16:36,124 --> 01:16:38,536
<font color="#ff00ff">She's better for you, it's obvious.</font>

1171
01:16:39,895 --> 01:16:41,374
<font color="#ff00ff">She's beautiful...</font>

1172
01:16:42,397 --> 01:16:44,035
<font color="#ff00ff">she's traumatological...</font>

1173
01:16:46,034 --> 01:16:48,537
<font color="#ff00ff">She doesn't have kids
and she loves you.</font>

1174
01:16:50,939 --> 01:16:52,009
<font color="#ff00ff">You know...</font>

1175
01:16:52,774 --> 01:16:55,050
<font color="#ff00ff">when I was a teenager</font>

1176
01:16:55,243 --> 01:16:57,223
<font color="#ff00ff">and relatively impetuous,</font>

1177
01:16:58,480 --> 01:17:00,926
<font color="#ff00ff">I often sought refuge in this pavilion.</font>

1178
01:17:01,483 --> 01:17:06,091
<font color="#ff00ff">I liked thinking about the woman
who might one day share my life.</font>

1179
01:17:07,222 --> 01:17:08,633
<font color="#ff00ff">And I said to myself...</font>

1180
01:17:10,425 --> 01:17:11,733
<font color="#ff00ff">I would love...</font>

1181
01:17:12,727 --> 01:17:14,138
<font color="#ff00ff">to be here...</font>

1182
01:17:15,263 --> 01:17:17,209
<font color="#ff00ff">when I told her I loved her.</font>

1183
01:17:20,302 --> 01:17:22,441
<font color="#ff00ff">I think it's a beautiful spot</font>

1184
01:17:22,904 --> 01:17:25,316
<font color="#ff00ff">to ask someone...</font>

1185
01:17:25,674 --> 01:17:29,451
<font color="#ff00ff">if she wants to share your life,
for better or for worse.</font>

1186
01:17:29,811 --> 01:17:33,588
<font color="#ff00ff">And tell her that a young love
won't stand in the way.</font>

1187
01:17:38,753 --> 01:17:41,427
<font color="#ff00ff">- There's couch grass everywhere.
-Yes, there is.</font>

1188
01:17:42,791 --> 01:17:44,600
<font color="#ff00ff">There's even a tag over there.</font>

1189
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:45,904
<font color="#ff00ff">"Go fun...</font>

1190
01:17:48,697 --> 01:17:50,677
<font color="#ff00ff">An angry teenager, I imagine.</font>

1191
01:17:54,669 --> 01:17:57,809
<font color="#ff00ff">But girls like being told
things like that...</font>

1192
01:17:59,174 --> 01:18:00,983
<font color="#ff00ff">even in strange places.</font>

1193
01:18:02,277 --> 01:18:03,813
<font color="#ff00ff">It's always nice to hear.</font>

1194
01:18:05,113 --> 01:18:06,285
<font color="#ff00ff">You know...</font>

1195
01:18:06,815 --> 01:18:08,692
<font color="#ff00ff">what I really feared...</font>

1196
01:18:09,484 --> 01:18:12,863
<font color="#ff00ff">wasn't that the girl
wouldn't like the spot...</font>

1197
01:18:13,889 --> 01:18:15,630
<font color="#ff00ff">but that she wouldn't like me.</font>

1198
01:18:15,824 --> 01:18:16,928
<font color="#ff00ff">Oh yeah?</font>

1199
01:18:21,129 --> 01:18:24,008
<font color="#ff00ff">That would be a very cold-hearted girl.</font>

1200
01:18:24,966 --> 01:18:26,946
<font color="#ff00ff">- Because...
- Really?</font>

1201
01:18:54,729 --> 01:18:57,232
<font color="#ff00ff">Where's Paul-Andre? What are they doing?</font>

1202
01:18:57,432 --> 01:18:59,207
<font color="#ff00ff">And what's that ringing?</font>

1203
01:18:59,401 --> 01:19:00,812
<font color="#ff00ff">It's Mom's phone.</font>

1204
01:19:01,002 --> 01:19:04,245
<font color="#ff00ff">Can't someone please answer'?
It's the umpteenth time!</font>

1205
01:19:04,439 --> 01:19:06,851
<font color="#ff00ff">Go on, answer it. It's killing my ears!</font>

1206
01:19:08,843 --> 01:19:10,880
<font color="#ff00ff">So you let yourself be bought?</font>

1207
01:19:11,079 --> 01:19:13,081
<font color="#ff00ff">You let him buy your kids too?</font>

1208
01:19:13,281 --> 01:19:16,660
<font color="#ff00ff">You abandoned me for money?
I found your contract!</font>

part of her family for 3 months!"</font>

1213
01:19:27,562 --> 01:19:30,236
<font color="#ff00ff">You found another crackpot!
I don't believe it!</font>

1214
01:19:30,432 --> 01:19:31,274
<font color="#ff00ff">He paid you</font>

1216
01:19:32,801 --> 01:19:34,405
<font color="#ff00ff">You lied to all of us.</font>

1217
01:19:36,037 --> 01:19:38,244
<font color="#ff00ff">Shit, we trusted you!</font>

1218
01:19:38,606 --> 01:19:41,052
<font color="#ff00ff">I swear to god, Violet, you disgust me!</font>

1219
01:19:52,053 --> 01:19:53,623
<font color="#ff00ff">What happened?</font>

1220
01:19:54,456 --> 01:19:56,094
<font color="#ff00ff">She threw a fit.</font>

1221
01:19:56,291 --> 01:19:57,292
<font color="#ff00ff">Lucie?</font>

1222
01:20:02,998 --> 01:20:04,306
<font color="#ff00ff">What's wrong?</font>

1223
01:20:04,499 --> 01:20:05,705
<font color="#ff00ff">Come on, tell me.</font>

1224
01:20:06,234 --> 01:20:07,304
<font color="#ff00ff">Why did she do this?</font>

1225
01:20:07,502 --> 01:20:10,244
<font color="#ff00ff">Remy told her you guys had a contract.</font>

1226
01:20:11,072 --> 01:20:12,881
<font color="#ff00ff">That it was all fake.</font>

1227
01:20:13,575 --> 01:20:15,885
<font color="#ff00ff">It's not all fake. It's not.</font>

1228
01:20:16,411 --> 01:20:17,446
<font color="#ff00ff">Lucie...</font>

1229
01:20:17,645 --> 01:20:18,749
<font color="#ff00ff">Get away from me.</font>

1230
01:20:20,749 --> 01:20:22,626
<font color="#ff00ff">Is it fake or not?</font>

1231
01:20:24,819 --> 01:20:25,991
<font color="#ff00ff">No.</font>

1232
01:20:27,088 --> 01:20:29,159
<font color="#ff00ff">You can tell when feelings are fake.</font>

1233
01:20:29,357 --> 01:20:31,633
<font color="#ff00ff">Did you feel like it was fake?</font>

1234
01:20:31,826 --> 01:20:33,305
<font color="#ff00ff">Then that means it's real.</font>

1235
01:20:35,096 --> 01:20:37,940
<font color="#ff00ff">There's nothing more I can do.
I'll get going.</font>

1236
01:20:45,340 --> 01:20:47,013
<font color="#ff00ff">Here's my card.</font>

1237
01:20:47,642 --> 01:20:48,677
<font color="#ff00ff">You never know.</font>

1238
01:21:01,289 --> 01:21:03,496
<font color="#ff00ff">I'm not getting in the car with him.</font>

1239
01:21:03,691 --> 01:21:06,171
<font color="#ff00ff">Don't try to mess with me.
It's me or him.</font>

1240
01:21:06,861 --> 01:21:08,670
<font color="#ff00ff">Paul-Andre, get lost.</font>

1241
01:21:08,863 --> 01:21:12,436
<font color="#ff00ff">My mom is family, I have to see her.
But not you!</font>

1242
01:21:17,639 --> 01:21:19,983
<font color="#ff00ff">It would've been too complicated anyhow.</font>

1243
01:21:44,232 --> 01:21:45,802
<font color="#ff00ff">I'm sorry for you.</font>

1244
01:21:48,236 --> 01:21:49,237
<font color="#ff00ff">No.</font>

1245
01:21:50,572 --> 01:21:51,915
<font color="#ff00ff">Don't even go there.</font>

1246
01:21:53,174 --> 01:21:55,211
<font color="#ff00ff">Don't pretend you care.</font>

1247
01:21:56,211 --> 01:21:58,817
<font color="#ff00ff">You don't give a damn
about either Violet or Lucie.</font>

1248
01:21:59,013 --> 01:22:00,651
<font color="#ff00ff">Or about me for that matter.</font>

1249
01:22:01,950 --> 01:22:05,261
<font color="#ff00ff">It's not my fault
if the poor girl's nerves snapped.</font>

1250
01:22:07,188 --> 01:22:09,031
<font color="#ff00ff">Don't call her "poor girl."</font>

1251
01:22:09,858 --> 01:22:12,202
<font color="#ff00ff">You almost sound loving.</font>

1252
01:22:12,894 --> 01:22:14,737
<font color="#ff00ff">But you've never been loving.</font>

1253
01:22:14,929 --> 01:22:16,567
<font color="#ff00ff">That's why I'm not.</font>

1254
01:22:19,534 --> 01:22:21,445
<font color="#ff00ff">Ok, everything? my fault.</font>

1255
01:22:27,542 --> 01:22:28,748
<font color="#ff00ff">What are you doing?</font>

1256
01:22:28,943 --> 01:22:30,889
<font color="#ff00ff">Calling Leon. I want to go home.</font>

1257
01:22:31,980 --> 01:22:35,120
<font color="#ff00ff">You're leaving right away?
Can't you stay a while?</font>

1258
01:22:35,884 --> 01:22:36,919
<font color="#ff00ff">No, Mother.</font>

1259
01:22:37,819 --> 01:22:39,457
<font color="#ff00ff">I'll leave you alone.</font>

1260
01:22:39,654 --> 01:22:41,463
<font color="#ff00ff">Because you love being alone.</font>

1261
01:22:41,656 --> 01:22:43,465
<font color="#ff00ff">And I like being alone too.</font>

1262
01:22:45,493 --> 01:22:48,633
<font color="#ff00ff">You're so much like your father
when you act this way.</font>

1263
01:22:54,002 --> 01:22:55,538
<font color="#ff00ff">Hello, Leon?</font>

1264
01:22:56,404 --> 01:22:57,280
<font color="#ff00ff">Yes, it's me.</font>

1265
01:22:57,472 --> 01:23:00,612
<font color="#ff00ff">Could you pick me up at my mother's
as soon as possible?</font>

1266
01:23:01,009 --> 01:23:02,147
<font color="#ff00ff">Thank you.</font>

1267
01:23:10,618 --> 01:23:11,722
<font color="#ff00ff">No, Mother.</font>

1268
01:23:12,420 --> 01:23:14,093
<font color="#ff00ff">Let me do that.</font>

1269
01:23:14,522 --> 01:23:15,762
<font color="#ff00ff">I'll do it.</font>

1270
01:25:20,148 --> 01:25:23,391
<font color="#ff00ff">You have a first client
for your table decorations?</font>

1271
01:25:27,322 --> 01:25:28,357
<font color="#ff00ff">Yes.</font>

1272
01:25:28,823 --> 01:25:29,927
<font color="#ff00ff">A wedding.</font>

1273
01:25:30,992 --> 01:25:32,130
<font color="#ff00ff">You don't say!</font>

1274
01:25:32,927 --> 01:25:34,907
<font color="#ff00ff">That's so cool, Mom.</font>

1275
01:25:35,930 --> 01:25:38,376
<font color="#ff00ff">A wedding is fantastic.
You must be happy.</font>

1276
01:25:38,766 --> 01:25:40,803
<font color="#ff00ff">Yes. I'm very, very happy.</font>

1277
01:25:42,503 --> 01:25:44,881
<font color="#ff00ff">Did you find a name for your company?</font>

1278
01:25:46,074 --> 01:25:47,280
<font color="#ff00ff">No.</font>

1279
01:25:49,510 --> 01:25:51,114
<font color="#ff00ff">It's Tuesday.</font>

1280
01:25:51,312 --> 01:25:53,485
<font color="#ff00ff">I have to file the papers on Tuesday.</font>

1281
01:25:54,515 --> 01:25:58,224
<font color="#ff00ff">It was Lucie who helped me
with the paperwork.</font>

1282
01:25:59,087 --> 01:26:00,725
<font color="#ff00ff">She was very sweet.</font>

1283
01:26:04,625 --> 01:26:06,832
<font color="#ff00ff">"Violet's Déco!"</font>

1284
01:26:07,028 --> 01:26:08,006
<font color="#ff00ff">That's pathetic.</font>

1285
01:26:08,196 --> 01:26:09,800
<font color="#ff00ff">You need an English word.</font>

1286
01:26:09,997 --> 01:26:11,738
<font color="#ff00ff">It would be better.</font>

1287
01:26:11,933 --> 01:26:13,935
<font color="#ff00ff">For example,</font>

1288
01:26:14,135 --> 01:26:15,978
<font color="#ff00ff">"Violet's Style." How's that?</font>

1289
01:26:16,170 --> 01:26:18,673
<font color="#ff00ff">That's great.
Do you like "Violet's Style"?</font>

1290
01:26:20,174 --> 01:26:21,676
<font color="#ff00ff">"Wolefs Style..."</font>

1291
01:26:22,710 --> 01:26:24,280
<font color="#ff00ff">Yes, that's nice.</font>

1292
01:26:25,546 --> 01:26:27,253
<font color="#ff00ff">I think it's nice.</font>

1293
01:27:06,053 --> 01:27:09,296
<font color="#ff00ff">You manipulated us!
You played with our feelings!</font>

1294
01:27:10,992 --> 01:27:12,164
<font color="#ff00ff">And what about me?</font>

1295
01:27:13,227 --> 01:27:15,798
<font color="#ff00ff">Did it ever occur to you
for a single second,</font>

1296
01:27:15,997 --> 01:27:18,307
<font color="#ff00ff">that I might be shaken up</font>

1297
01:27:19,100 --> 01:27:19,976
<font color="#ff00ff">b'! my feelings?</font>

1298
01:27:45,860 --> 01:27:47,032
<font color="#ff00ff">Thank you.</font>

1299
01:27:48,296 --> 01:27:50,537
<font color="#ff00ff">You don't go out at night anymore.</font>

1300
01:27:50,731 --> 01:27:53,405
<font color="#ff00ff">I don't have time anymore
with my company.</font>

1301
01:27:53,601 --> 01:27:54,773
<font color="#ff00ff">Yeah, I guess.</font>

1302
01:27:56,404 --> 01:27:57,576
<font color="#ff00ff">- Hello!
-Hi Lucie!</font>

1303
01:27:57,772 --> 01:28:00,252
<font color="#ff00ff">There she is. Get a bowl for her.</font>

1304
01:28:01,476 --> 01:28:02,614
<font color="#ff00ff">Hi!</font>

1305
01:28:08,149 --> 01:28:08,957
<font color="#ff00ff">Thanks.</font>

1306
01:28:09,150 --> 01:28:10,390
<font color="#ff00ff">How's life?</font>

1307
01:28:10,751 --> 01:28:11,593
<font color="#ff00ff">Great.</font>

1308
01:28:12,620 --> 01:28:14,429
<font color="#ff00ff">Mind telling me where you were?</font>

1309
01:28:14,622 --> 01:28:16,124
<font color="#ff00ff">At Paul-Andre's.</font>

1310
01:28:18,226 --> 01:28:19,296
<font color="#ff00ff">What?</font>

1311
01:29:03,037 --> 01:29:05,916
<font color="#ff00ff">I don't know why you came back.
There's no point.</font>

1312
01:29:08,109 --> 01:29:10,020
<font color="#ff00ff">There's always a point.</font>

1313
01:29:11,646 --> 01:29:12,681
<font color="#ff00ff">To coming back?</font>

1314
01:29:13,314 --> 01:29:15,157
<font color="#ff00ff">It only means leaving again.</font>

1315
01:29:15,516 --> 01:29:16,927
<font color="#ff00ff">Not necessarily.</font>

1316
01:29:19,654 --> 01:29:21,258
<font color="#ff00ff">You can come back...</font>

1317
01:29:22,156 --> 01:29:23,533
<font color="#ff00ff">and stay forever.</font>

1318
01:29:26,027 --> 01:29:27,472
<font color="#ff00ff">I don't think so.</font>

1319
01:29:28,863 --> 01:29:30,934
<font color="#ff00ff">That kind of thing never works out.</font>

1320
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:34,336
<font color="#ff00ff">Of course it can workout.</font>

1321
01:29:34,869 --> 01:29:36,473
<font color="#ff00ff">We all get along, don't we?</font>

1322
01:29:37,672 --> 01:29:39,174
<font color="#ff00ff">Mom's right.</font>

1323
01:29:40,041 --> 01:29:41,714
<font color="#ff00ff">Nothing ever works out.</font>

1324
01:29:49,550 --> 01:29:52,224
<font color="#ff00ff">Besides, we're too noisy for you.</font>

1325
01:29:54,221 --> 01:29:55,564
<font color="#ff00ff">I could...</font>

1326
01:29:55,756 --> 01:29:58,032
<font color="#ff00ff">I like it when you make noise.</font>

1327
01:29:58,225 --> 01:30:00,227
<font color="#ff00ff">I think it's great. Honestly.</font>

1328
01:30:00,928 --> 01:30:02,134
<font color="#ff00ff">You say that now.</font>

1329
01:30:02,997 --> 01:30:05,375
<font color="#ff00ff">What about in three weeks' time?</font>

1330
01:30:05,566 --> 01:30:07,978
<font color="#ff00ff">You'll be fed up. That's the reality.</font>

1331
01:30:08,936 --> 01:30:11,348
<font color="#ff00ff">Right?
In the long run, no one gets along.</font>

1332
01:30:11,539 --> 01:30:13,348
<font color="#ff00ff">And we're much too messy.</font>

1333
01:30:13,541 --> 01:30:15,680
<font color="#ff00ff">You can't live with people like us.</font>

1334
01:30:15,876 --> 01:30:16,911
<font color="#ff00ff">It's pure hell.</font>

1335
01:30:17,111 --> 01:30:18,215
<font color="#ff00ff">Yes.</font>

1336
01:30:19,413 --> 01:30:21,051
<font color="#ff00ff">What's wrong with all of you?</font>

1337
01:30:25,052 --> 01:30:29,262
<font color="#ff00ff">Whatever? meant to be will be.
You have to trust life.</font>

1338
01:30:29,624 --> 01:30:31,069
<font color="#ff00ff">We're happy together.</font>

1339
01:30:31,525 --> 01:30:32,196
<font color="#ff00ff">Aren't we?</font>

1340
01:30:35,296 --> 01:30:36,673
<font color="#ff00ff">We missed each other.</font>

1341
01:30:37,765 --> 01:30:40,041
<font color="#ff00ff">Lucie.
We missed each other, right?</font>

1342
01:30:40,935 --> 01:30:44,610
<font color="#ff00ff">We'd be heading straight for disaster.</font>

1343

<font color="#ff00ff">That much we know.</font>

1344
01:30:47,475 --> 01:30:49,546
<font color="#ff00ff">In the end, you're always alone.</font>

1345
01:30:49,744 --> 01:30:50,586
<font color="#ff00ff">Always.</font>

1346
01:30:50,778 --> 01:30:53,349
<font color="#ff00ff">Don't forget the end of the world!</font>

1347
01:30:55,383 --> 01:30:56,760
<font color="#ff00ff">Yeah, that too.</font>

1348
01:30:57,585 --> 01:30:58,859
<font color="#ff00ff">The end of the world...</font>

1349
01:30:59,053 --> 01:31:00,464
<font color="#ff00ff">It's serious stuff.</font>

1350
01:31:01,789 --> 01:31:03,029
<font color="#ff00ff">Death period.</font>

1351
01:31:04,392 --> 01:31:06,804
<font color="#ff00ff">We're all heading for death.
That's a fact.</font>

1352
01:31:06,994 --> 01:31:08,302
<font color="#ff00ff">There's death...</font>

1353
01:31:08,496 --> 01:31:09,304
<font color="#ff00ff">and disease...</font>

1354
01:31:09,497 --> 01:31:11,773
<font color="#ff00ff">Yes! I hadn't thought of that.</font>

1355
01:31:11,966 --> 01:31:14,412
<font color="#ff00ff">- Very true. It was about time.
- Metastases...</font>

1356
01:31:14,602 --> 01:31:16,912
<font color="#ff00ff">Absolutely. Heart attacks...</font>

1357
01:31:17,104 --> 01:31:20,574
<font color="#ff00ff">- Heart attacks!
- It could happen any time.</font>

1358
01:31:20,775 --> 01:31:23,813
<font color="#ff00ff">I think it would be better
to end it all now.</font>

1359
01:31:24,345 --> 01:31:27,758
<font color="#ff00ff">- It's the surest thing.
- Maybe you're right. Good idea.</font>

1360
01:31:27,948 --> 01:31:29,825
<font color="#ff00ff">I agree, there's no point in...</font>

1361
01:31:30,017 --> 01:31:32,930
<font color="#ff00ff">- On top of it, the sun's out.
- Oh my god!</font>

1362
01:31:33,120 --> 01:31:35,066
<font color="#ff00ff">The sun's out. How horrible!</font>

1363
01:31:35,256 --> 01:31:37,600
<font color="#ff00ff">It's so depressing when the sun's out.</font>

1364
01:31:38,159 --> 01:31:39,399
<font color="#ff00ff">You think it'll last?</font>

1365
01:31:40,194 --> 01:31:42,003
<font color="#ff00ff">Yes. For the rest of your lives.</font>

1366
01:31:42,196 --> 01:31:43,732
<font color="#ff00ff">How horrible!</font>

1367
01:31:45,833 --> 01:31:47,335
<font color="#ff00ff">What'll we do?</font>
