1
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:24,226
This walk is exactly
what you need.

2
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:27,020
You've been coiled up like a spring.
I don't even know who you are anymore.

3
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:29,314
It's a big meeting, I'd think
you'd be a little nervous.

4
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:32,276
I don't get nervous, Dan. I get excited.

5
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:35,195
Please don't tell the story.

6
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,072
You're a people person,
Charlie, that's wonderful,

7
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,825
but in business meetings you tell
personal items from my life,

8
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:42,744
- and it embarrasses me.
- Girls, girls, girls!

9
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:46,498
Hey! Ten miles!

10
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:49,293
I'm sorry, Lucky.

11
00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:52,171
I think he's too old for sprints.
I can hear his legs clicking.

12
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:53,714
Those are my knees.

13
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:56,508
Do you really think I tell
that story for my own amusement?

14
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:58,594
I do it because it's a sales tool.

15
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:00,637
Charlie, let's win this account
on our pitch.

16
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:02,514
It's sports marketing.
You need an edge.

17
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:06,185
- I don't want to be the edge.
- Hey, mister! Little help!

18
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:07,853
Sure thing, guys!

19
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:10,981
Whoa!

20
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:13,275
- Ow!
- Oh! Oh! Oh!

21
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:16,320
- Why did you do that?
- My bad! Sorry!

22
00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:19,156
- I didn't mean to.
- You're a monster!

23
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,866
I'm sorry!

24
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:22,659
You're allergic to anything
under four feet. You're a mess.

25
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:25,662
- Promise you won't tell the story.
- Fine. I won't tell the story.

26
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:29,333
OK, you guys want to hear
the greatest Dan Rayburn story ever?

27
00:03:29,417 --> 00:03:31,460
- No, don't.
- Please. Come on, Danny.

28
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:34,463
All right. Seven years ago,
Dan's divorce had just come through

29
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:36,715
and his ex-wife had
left his heart in tatters.

30
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,509
And his bank account drained.
Tell them that.

31
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:42,137
He was taking it pretty well.

32
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:44,723
That's good.
You're taking it like a man!

33
00:03:44,807 --> 00:03:47,476
Stiff upper lip! Getting smart!

34
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:50,896
- What?
- Oh, God!

35
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:53,106
People say I saved
my partner's life that day.

36
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:57,027
So many people get divorced.

37
00:03:57,111 --> 00:04:00,322
And neither one of you wanted kids.
Now that seems like a stroke of genius!

38
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:03,659
But that didn't console him.
I had to act. I had to do something.

39
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:07,162
Mr. Good Time is going to
teach you how to live! Yeah!

40
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:10,832
- Why are there two pieces of luggage?
- Oh, just a little jaunt.

41
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:14,336
Nothing too wild.

42
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:19,424
Hey, Mr. Good Times.
You said we'd come to Miami, we did.

43
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:20,550
Can we go home now?

44
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:22,427
Whoa!

45
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:23,929
- Whoa.
- Yeah!

46
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:25,555
Does this drink
come with a diving board?

47
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,849
It's insane! Just a sip, I think.

48
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:30,519
So as a best friend, I felt compelled

49
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:33,230
to give him a gentle reminder
ofwhat it was like to be free.

50
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:36,608
- I want it to say: "free man!"
- Free man.

51
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:38,068
Big letters, right across his chest.

52
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:40,070
"Free man!" Comprende?

53
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:44,241
Oh. Good night, nurse.

54
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:48,078
I could have sworn
that guy spoke English.

55
00:04:48,162 --> 00:04:51,456
It was supposed to say "free man. "

56
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,875
Fremont, Fremont, Fremont...

57
00:04:55,044 --> 00:04:56,378
Free man!

58
00:05:00,174 --> 00:05:04,219
It's funny, guys.
Come on. They love it.

59
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:06,638
Then the unexpected happened.

60
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:10,142
Look at all the babes.
Don't look, don't look. Now look.

61
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:12,311
Fourteen hours after
signing his divorce papers,

62
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:14,980
Dan met Vicki, the girl of his dreams.

63
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:16,732
- Whoa!
- Whoa.

64
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:18,233
Girl in white,
eleven o'clock.

65
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,777
- Yeah, but...
- Oh, give her the Queen's wave.

66
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:23,238
- No, the other Queen.
- Oh. Hello.

67
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:24,948
She was traveling
with a friend.

68
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:27,743
I thought maybe the friend
was a magician or a jazz dancer,

69
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:29,328
because of the way
she was moving her hands.

70
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:31,246
Turns out she's a hand model.

71
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,582
- ... hand model.
- A hand model?

72
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:35,042
They model with their hands.

73
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:38,628
So, within minutes,
Dan is back to his old self.

74
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:42,090
No, scratch that.
He's better than his old self.

75
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:43,592
Charlie, look at these pictures!

76
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:46,345
My whole life I've never taken
a good picture.

77
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:49,348
♪ No matter how
they toss the dice, it had to be ♪

78
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:50,766
I'd never seen him
so free, OK?

79
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:53,101
I mean, so impulsive.
He was a changed man.

80
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:57,606
Or maybe not so changed.

81
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:00,609
It's hard to explain to a guy
who's never had an impulsive moment

82
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:03,111
in his life there's
two kinds of impulsives.

83
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:06,114
The good kind, OK,
but this is plain stupid!

84
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:09,326
That was so romantic.

85
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:17,042
But when he woke up, he remembered,
"I was just married 14 painful years

86
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:19,044
- and I've gone and done it again!"
- Whoops.

87
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:24,216
To a woman that
he barely knows. His "soul mate. "

88
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:28,470
...soul mate.
- Soul mate!

89
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:32,140
Soul mate!

90
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:39,481
They never laugh this much.

91
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:44,361
So, a few hours later,
my buddy here, my hombre,

92
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:48,240
is the only guy I know that's been
divorced twice in a 24-hour period.

93
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:52,744
Now, that's a true story.

94
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:56,498
Fremont! Fremont! Fremont!

95
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:03,880
- It was supposed to say "free man. "
- But it didn't. It said "Fremont. "

96
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:06,425
It's a big mistake.
It's on his chest forever.

97
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:12,013
I don't really think that story
honors the feelings I had for her.

98
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:14,850
No, I'm sorry.
Dan, people love that story.

99
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:19,104
So just get up there and do
your thing. Because I killed.

100
00:07:19,188 --> 00:07:20,272
Banzai!

101
00:07:20,356 --> 00:07:22,607
Lxnay on the banzai.

102
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:24,443
Nishamura Media Group

103
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:27,571
entering the US sports market
is a huge deal.

104
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:30,282
Now, I know you've met
with larger groups,

105
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:34,953
but I'm about to show you
why working with a boutique firm

106
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:38,957
run by two seasoned pros
is a smart move for you.

107
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:43,170
Forty-seven million dollars
over five years.

108
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:45,714
Man, you better shape up
on your Japanese,

109
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:47,257
'cause you're going to Tokyo, baby!

110
00:07:47,341 --> 00:07:49,926
Thank you. This is the kind of
opportunity I've been looking for.

111
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:53,472
And you will not be sorry.
In college my nickname was "GT."

112
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:57,392
- That's "Go To. " You go to me.
- What's the matter with you?

113
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:00,145
Biggest deal of our lives
isn't exciting enough for you?

114
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:03,273
So it's a done deal now?
There are a few small details.

115
00:08:03,357 --> 00:08:04,941
Like next week when Nishamura
and his son come to town

116
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:06,443
we have to win them over
on the golf course.

117
00:08:06,527 --> 00:08:07,944
- That'll be easy.
- I'm great at golf.

118
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:10,197
Then, two weeks from now,
we have to make a presentation

119
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:12,407
- to their executive board of directors.
- Done.

120
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,576
All right, sunshine.
What's really wrong with you?

121
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:18,121
I was not divorced twice, OK?

122
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:19,915
One of them was an annulment.

123
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:22,501
- Look at that face!
- Charlie, don't!

124
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:24,419
Look at this, Craig.
You know what this face is?

125
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,463
- The face of a winner.
- This face is willing to hibernate

126
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:29,341
for six months to make the
best deal he could possibly make.

127
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:33,011
And I don't care who knows it. A toast
to my best buddy and business partner,

128
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:34,846
- Dan Rayburn! Whoo!
- Whoo!

129
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:36,806
Arigato!

130
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:45,273
It all comes down to this.

131
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:46,775
- I don't think so.
- Three, two, one.

132
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:48,401
This one's the shooter.

133
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:49,736
- Let's see it.
- Golden moment.

134
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:52,781
- Oh. Uh-oh!
- Oh, you're just sinkin' em.

135
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:54,616
Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh.

136
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,701
Let's hit it. There you go.

137
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:58,203
- It's a leaking dog.
- Yeah.

138
00:08:58,287 --> 00:09:02,040
That's a... That's a neat trick.
How old is that dog?

139
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:04,543
I lost count. Vet said it was a record.

140
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:07,295
You might want to put
a diaper on him, or underwear.

141
00:09:08,464 --> 00:09:11,216
- Yo.
- Hey. Where you been?

142
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,802
Japanese real estate agents.
Some apartments for Craig-san.

143
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:15,887
Thank you. I just want to find
something authentic.

144
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:17,973
I've been getting so immersed
in Japanese culture,

145
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:20,475
by the time I hit Tokyo, they're
going to think I'm part Japanese.

146
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,686
They'll be like, "Who is this local?"

147
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:26,398
I don't care if you stay on the top
of Mount Fuji. Just bring home the yen.

148
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:29,150
- This can't be.
- What do you got?

149
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:31,861
- Vicki.
- Vicki who?

150
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:34,072
South Beach Vicki? She's in town.

151
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:38,118
- She wants to see me. Today.
- She just called you out of the blue?

152
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:41,037
- No.
- Dan? Dan?

153
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:43,873
You know last Christmas
when I moved in to the condo?

154
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:46,418
I was feeling really lonely.

155
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:48,753
And maybe I wrote a seven-to-ten-page
single-spaced letter.

156
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:51,047
Oh, Dan.

157
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:53,091
You've been using your feelings
for this woman

158
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:54,593
to avoid your life for seven years.

159
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:58,763
I set you up in the most exclusive
adult-only condo.

160
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:00,265
You've never been to theme nights.

161
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:03,268
You never once went to the
Sunday morning schmooze and schmeer.

162
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:05,520
You know, maybe she hasn't
moved on either.

163
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,063
- Well, you can't do it.
- Why?

164
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:09,274
Because we're in the middle
of our biggest deal ever,

165
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:10,400
and you don't have the time.

166
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:13,612
She lives in Vermont. It's perfect.
Start of a long-distance relationship.

167
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:15,947
You get six to nine months
of the spa weekends,

168
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:18,450
late-night phone calls.
I'd still have my days free to work.

169
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:20,160
She wants to meet me
at Grand Central Station,

170
00:10:20,244 --> 00:10:21,578
and I don't know what
I'm supposed to wear.

171
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:24,122
It's not formal, obviously,
it's a train station,

172
00:10:24,206 --> 00:10:26,583
but do I wear a sport coat,
or coat and tie...

173
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:28,501
You can wear a sports coat,
but you're not going like that.

174
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:29,961
- Why?
- 'Cause you look like an albino.

175
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:36,676
This is his first time, so you can see
his complexion is ghost-like.

176
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:39,054
- What do you think of the El Tropical?
- Perfect beginner's tan.

177
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:40,764
- Oh, great.
- Yeah. Let's go!

178
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:42,307
- You all set?
- Oh, yeah.

179
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:47,270
- I'm ready. Alrighty, let's do this.
- Um... so...

180
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:50,940
Face forward, press the red button,
spray lasts ten seconds.

181
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:54,569
Keep your eyes closed and call me
on the intercom when you're done.

182
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:55,987
OK.

183
00:10:57,907 --> 00:11:02,410
Eyes closed. She wanted a golden god,
she's going to get one.

184
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:04,496
Whoa, um...

185
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,831
HAL?

186
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:10,669
I definitely think that the tan line
accentuates the look, don't you?

187
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:12,295
- Uh-huh. Sexy.
- Mmm.

188
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:16,591
I'm gonna start now.

189
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:23,640
Whoa!

190
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:32,524
One... Whoa!

191
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:36,528
Two. Three. Four. Five. Six.

192
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:40,490
Seven. Eight. Nine. OK!

193
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:41,950
Hello!

194
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,038
I'm finished!

195
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:49,624
Be there in a sec.

196
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:52,460
So, do you, like, really know Shaq?

197
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:54,587
- Whose numbers are those?
- Oh, my gosh.

198
00:11:58,634 --> 00:12:02,011
We have a problem here!

199
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:06,307
- Shaq! Yeah, Charlie.
- It's not turning off!

200
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:09,227
- Tell him your name.
- Shaq? Hi, it's Kelly.

201
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:10,478
Anybody out there?

202
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,814
Do you remember me?
I went to one of your games.

203
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:13,898
Help!

204
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:16,151
Yeah. I don't know who
you were playing against, but...

205
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:18,361
I have an emergency here!

206
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:20,572
Help!

207
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:24,242
Just relax. Be there in a sec.

208
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:25,744
Help!

209
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:28,538
- A tanning emergency?
- Newbies.

210
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:31,499
Keep the heat kind of medium...

211
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:34,502
Throw a little bit of butter, and...

212
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:56,107
Westbound local
now arriving on track two.

213
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:58,359
Westbound local now arriving.

214
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:07,911
I'm from Hoboken.

215
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:17,378
What am I, the United Nations?
This is crazy.

216
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:19,589
Look, Mom,
it's an Oompa-Loompa.

217
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:21,841
I'm an Oompa-Loompa. I can't do this!

218
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:25,053
- Excuse me...
- Dan?

219
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:28,056
Vicki?

220
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:31,100
- Wow!
- Hey!

221
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:33,102
- I mean, hi!
- Hi.

222
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:35,980
Look at you! You're so tan.

223
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:38,399
Yeah. Yeah.

224
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:41,986
Boca. Volleyball, and...
Look at you. You're hot!

225
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:43,738
- Thanks, Tan.
- Dan.

226
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:46,324
- I mean, Dan.
- I'm Tan Dan.

227
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,744
I got us a table upstairs.

228
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:50,912
- Let's eat. Yeah.
- Shall we?

229
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:58,753
- Thank you.
- Oh!

230
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:06,219
I really don't know where to start, Dan.
But...

231
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,681
I need to share it with...

232
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:12,642
Stop... in the name of love.

233
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:18,273
Look, seven years ago,
we made magic happen.

234
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:20,400
But it was bad timing.

235
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:24,654
Now, we'll take it super slow,
there'll be no outside distractions.

236
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:29,367
Just us. I, um...

237
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:33,204
I'm ready to put these back together.
All I need is your half.

238
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:35,039
- I'm going to jail.
- What?

239
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:37,458
Tomorrow. Two weeks for trespassing.

240
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:39,919
- Why?
- A chemical company wanted

241
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:43,214
to build a plant that would've
drained into a stream near my house.

242
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:46,175
So I kind of chained myself
to a bulldozer

243
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,719
and burned the blueprints to the plant.

244
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:49,637
Look at you.
You're a political activist.

245
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:52,807
Well, I had ulterior motives.

246
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:55,768
- You're... Career politician?
- My kids.

247
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:57,979
Zach and Emily play near that stream.

248
00:14:59,106 --> 00:15:00,648
Kids.

249
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:03,401
You know, I just never thought that...

250
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:07,405
You... you'd be attached. But...

251
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:09,782
Actually, I'm a single mom.

252
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:11,910
You kidder!

253
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:14,245
- Twins!
- Ouch!

254
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:18,124
Yeah. They think I'm going
to a spa named Westford Farms.

255
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:20,126
Whoops!

256
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:22,045
You remember my best friend,
Jenna, from South Beach.

257
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:23,838
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah, the hand model.

258
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:26,257
They're staying with her.
She's like family.

259
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:29,886
You got so much going on, girl.
It just blows my mind.

260
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:32,722
That's good, because there's
one other small detail.

261
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:34,682
- What is it?
- Daddy!

262
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:41,940
You guys weren't supposed
to be back for 45 minutes!

263
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:43,608
I'm... Da... Da...

264
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:46,361
Oh! Hey, look who's panicking again.

265
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:55,203
He does not look good.
I'm calling the paramedics.

266
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:57,330
No! I'm OK.

267
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:02,251
Guys, would you give us
a minute? Please.

268
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:19,852
Dan, I got your letter six months ago,
and I won't lie, it threw me for a loop.

269
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:22,313
I was completely ready to go it alone.

270
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:24,941
But here was this...

271
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:31,447
...12-page, single-spaced letter
from the father of my kids,

272
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:35,076
and suddenly
I had to ask if I was being selfish.

273
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:38,454
Then three weeks ago,
we were in Friday's for dinner,

274
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:40,832
and Zach had to go to the bathroom,
and as I was taking him

275
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:43,501
to the ladies' room
for the ump teenth time...

276
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:47,005
...I realized, he's never
even been in a men's room.

277
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:51,009
- Really?
- My kids are seven. They have a father.

278
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:54,804
So I thought, maybe it's time
they got to know who he is.

279
00:16:56,140 --> 00:17:01,269
I have to confess, I've always been
a little awkward around children.

280
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:07,358
But I guess, if they're your own,
it's a different ballgame.

281
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:11,612
Well, we got a few hours to kill
while Jenna goes out on a hand audition.

282
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:13,781
- Let's find out.
- OK.

283
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:19,454
But first, what do you say
we get rid of that ridiculous tan?

284
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:21,330
I know a few family secrets.

285
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:23,541
- You don't like it?
- I'm sorry, do you like it?

286
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:25,710
- Not at all.
- OK.

287
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:29,464
- How's your face feel?
- Oh, pretty much everything.

288
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:32,175
- Come on, Dad!
- Oh, no.

289
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:34,719
Not the spinning one.
That's a recipe for disaster.

290
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:37,305
Hey, Dad? Want to see my
Five Favorite Food lists?

291
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:38,723
Oh, I'd love to, Z. Thanks.

292
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:41,225
- Zach likes to make lists.
- I love lists.

293
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,478
- Hot wings and milkshakes.
- Chocolate?

294
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:45,146
Oh, no, it gives me diarrhea.

295
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:49,358
I mean, stomach problems
and frequent gas-spasms.

296
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:51,235
- Oh.
- I have to go to the bathroom.

297
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,403
Oh, OK.

298
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:54,155
Hang on. Can you watch Emily?

299
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:56,657
- Sure.
- I want to go to the men's room.

300
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:58,493
With me?

301
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:00,661
OK.

302
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:11,589
You're pretty old. How come
you don't have any other kids?

303
00:18:11,673 --> 00:18:13,341
Well, um...

304
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:16,385
Initially, it was kind of a...

305
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,888
You do know where kids
come from, right?

306
00:18:18,972 --> 00:18:21,891
- Yeah, sure.
- Can you tell me?

307
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:27,438
Well, um...

308
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:32,693
In nature, the male and
the female of the species, uh,

309
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:37,615
in what some have called the
"dance of springtime," you know...

310
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:41,244
It's complicated.

311
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:46,415
Do I just stand here?

312
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,292
My mom usually waits outside.

313
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:50,419
I'll bet she does. I'm out of here.

314
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:58,177
OK.

315
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:01,931
- Ooh! You're early.
- Hi, hon!

316
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:04,016
I can do my hand cream later. Hi!

317
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:05,476
- Hi, Aunt Jenna!
- Hi.

318
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:08,563
Hi, Zach. Hello, Emily!

319
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:12,108
I booked it!

320
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:15,570
- I gotta go potty.
- All right. Lemonade inside!

321
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:17,113
- OK, I got them.
- I got the bags.

322
00:19:17,197 --> 00:19:19,073
- No, no, it's all right...
- No, please.

323
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:21,659
Oh!

324
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:23,953
Oh, no! I got it.

325
00:19:24,037 --> 00:19:25,496
OK, I got it.

326
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:27,415
No, wait. No, please don't.

327
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:31,669
- Oh, my God.
- Breathe! Breathe!

328
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:33,254
Oh, sorry!

329
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:39,886
Oh...

330
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:43,806
She's gonna be fine. She's a fighter.

331
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:46,517
She looks good. You look good, hon.

332
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:53,524
Can you hand me my cell phone?
I have to call my agent.

333
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:57,737
All right. Here we go. Here it is, hon.

334
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:02,200
- Do you want help?
- No, no.

335
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:04,076
I'm going to give you a minute.

336
00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:07,705
I'm so sorry.

337
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:15,213
Oh, God! What am I gonna do?

338
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:18,633
Come on, you're a great gal. You must
have plenty of friends you could call.

339
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:21,219
That I could trust
with my kids for two weeks?

340
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:25,223
This is a disaster!
I don't have anybody else!

341
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:28,392
That's not true.
No, no. You have me.

342
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:31,395
I'll do it. I'll take the kids.

343
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:35,149
I'll do it.

344
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:39,528
- I will.
- Really?

345
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:41,239
Oh, yeah.

346
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:44,242
Hey, yeah, see?

347
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:47,954
This is good.
This is a good thing.

348
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:55,378
- Do you know anybody else?
- No, just me.

349
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:01,342
And then suddenly,
you're supposed to take care of twins

350
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:03,844
when we have the biggest deal ever?
Aw, Dan!

351
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:07,348
I put their aunt in a halo for a month!
What am I supposed to do?

352
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:09,433
You're supposed to give them back!
They got 24 hours!

353
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:11,435
- They'll find another baby-sitter!
- I can't give them back!

354
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,771
They're my kids. It's not like puppies.
"Take them back. "

355
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:15,940
- Let's break it down. It's two weeks.
- OK.

356
00:21:16,024 --> 00:21:17,942
- Yeah.
- All right, let's see. We got, uh...

357
00:21:18,026 --> 00:21:19,777
They sleep 10, 12 hours, right, a day?

358
00:21:19,861 --> 00:21:21,445
- If you're lucky.
- You've got TV.

359
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:24,949
You've got bathroom time.
You give them a lot of timeouts.

360
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:26,033
You know what?

361
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:28,536
You're looking at about 90 minutes
of being a dad a day.

362
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:29,870
Ninety minutes?

363
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:31,747
It's a run-out-the-clock
situation, that's all.

364
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:33,291
- It's not sudden death.
- You'll be fine.

365
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:36,544
- Ha! We can do this.
- "We?" No, no.

366
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:39,463
You are on Planet Dan now, baby.

367
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:41,966
I'm down here on Earth,
just cheering you on.

368
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:45,928
You started this, remember? You're
the one who took me down to Florida.

369
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:48,764
"Mr. Feel-good" is gonna
teach me how to live.

370
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:52,310
I wasn't alone then,
I'm not gonna be alone now, OK?

371
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:56,147
So, tomorrow morning, 7:30, I want you
outside your apartment ready to go.

372
00:21:56,231 --> 00:21:58,566
Because if I'm going to be
an old dad for two weeks,

373
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:01,402
you're going to be "Uncle Charlie. "

374
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:04,697
Well, I don't want to
take care of the kids!

375
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:11,120
For both of them, I've packed
enough clothes for every occasion.

376
00:22:11,204 --> 00:22:12,788
- That everything?
- Yeah.

377
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:15,333
I can't believe I'm doing this.

378
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:16,584
Me, too.

379
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:19,086
Here's the number for
the poison control center.

380
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:21,130
- Poison control?
- Do you need a list of poisons?

381
00:22:21,214 --> 00:22:23,007
No, I think most of them I know.

382
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:25,718
I should have compiled a list
of commonly ingested poisons!

383
00:22:25,802 --> 00:22:28,095
I'm not going to poison our
children. They're in safe hands.

384
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,555
- Have you ever been to a casino?
- No.

385
00:22:29,639 --> 00:22:31,432
- Have you ever seen the movie Casino?
- No.

386
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:34,518
OK, there are only pay phones
in the common room,

387
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:36,187
so I will call you on your cell phone.

388
00:22:36,271 --> 00:22:37,980
- OK.
- And no baby-sitters.

389
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:40,983
Please, Dan.
They've gone seven years without a dad.

390
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:42,943
Promise me you will not
leave them with strangers.

391
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:45,363
- No strangers. Check.
- Dan! Vicki!

392
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:49,116
The kids have never seen
Friday the 13th, part one or two!

393
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:51,160
- Oh, my God!
- He's kidding. He's a kidder.

394
00:22:51,244 --> 00:22:53,204
He was scared of
The Wizard of Oz. He's kidding.

395
00:22:53,288 --> 00:22:54,789
The monkeys got him nuts.

396
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:58,125
- Oh, and one more thing.
- I'm up for it.

397
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:02,213
Well, Emily has kind of concocted
this idea that you're a superhero.

398
00:23:02,297 --> 00:23:03,798
Oh. Why?

399
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:07,051
Well, it was her way of
explaining where you were,

400
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:08,886
and it seemed harmless enough to me.

401
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:11,597
- What are my powers?
- You can stop bullets and you can fly.

402
00:23:11,681 --> 00:23:14,266
- Bulletproof and flying.
- One... Two... Three!

403
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:15,726
- Ooh!
- Whoa!

404
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:17,478
- Oh, gosh, I gotta go.
- OK.

405
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:20,856
I'm going to miss them so much.

406
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,400
OK...

407
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:24,902
Promise me...

408
00:23:24,986 --> 00:23:29,031
You will devote every ounce of
your being to taking care of them, Dan.

409
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:30,366
I promise.

410
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:32,827
- Promise me.
- I promise.

411
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:38,582
- So, you're not a superhero?
- Not at the present time.

412
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:42,920
Want to pick up the pace, Chachi?
We just got passed by a street sweeper.

413
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:44,713
How about putting it in drive, grandma?

414
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:47,883
There are babies on board!
Excuse me, kids.

415
00:23:56,977 --> 00:23:59,395
Ooh... Who's up for
chocolate chip pancakes?

416
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:01,981
- Me! Me!
- No chocolate chips for breakfast.

417
00:24:02,065 --> 00:24:04,608
- Why not?
- Kids crave limits. It's in the books.

418
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:08,070
Hey everybody, let's kick this off
with some really healthy choices.

419
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:09,530
How about the heartland granola?

420
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:12,074
That's like nature's broom!
That's kind of wonderful.

421
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:14,201
Hey! Whoa!

422
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:16,662
- Sorry.
- It's OK, Zach.

423
00:24:16,746 --> 00:24:18,539
- Here you go.
- It's an accident.

424
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:20,749
That kind of thing happens.
You have nothing to worry about.

425
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:22,960
- Hi there. How are you?
- Hi.

426
00:24:23,044 --> 00:24:25,629
- Good.
- Well, hello.

427
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:28,382
- What's your name?
- Rochelle.

428
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:31,427
Oh, Rochelle.

429
00:24:31,511 --> 00:24:34,805
Well, I didn't know they could
afford to hire supermodels here.

430
00:24:36,183 --> 00:24:39,310
Hey, Pops?
Isn't being a grandparent the best?

431
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:41,145
I'm not a grandparent.

432
00:24:41,229 --> 00:24:44,982
My grandkids call me "Nub-Nub. "
What do your grandkids call you?

433
00:24:45,066 --> 00:24:46,150
Nub-Nub's good.

434
00:24:46,234 --> 00:24:47,276
Attention, Pamela's diners.

435
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,488
We've just been informed we have two
new members to the grandparents' club.

436
00:24:54,075 --> 00:24:57,161
♪ Hey! Seniors, seniors, seniors!

442
00:25:14,262 --> 00:25:18,641
Rochelle, Rochelle... I don't know
what happened back there.

443
00:25:18,725 --> 00:25:20,518
Just a little too much
excitement for me.

444
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:23,187
Oh, no.

445
00:25:23,271 --> 00:25:25,940
Oh, no, no.
This is just an accident.

446
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:28,275
Don't worry. It's nothing
to be embarrassed about.

447
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,444
- I'm not embarrassed.
- I'll get you something.

448
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:33,822
It's a glass of water, that's all.

449
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:35,866
One glass of water
gets my pump going, too.

450
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:38,118
Uh-huh. Uh...

451
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:41,956
Also, please tell them
we are very focused

452
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,542
on the golfgame with Mr. Nishamura.

453
00:25:46,127 --> 00:25:48,879
Write that on your resume?
"Oh, I pop bubble paper. "

454
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:52,383
- Would you handle them?
- We want to Xerox our butts.

455
00:25:52,467 --> 00:25:54,468
Will you excuse me for one moment?

456
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:56,637
Get offthere. I'm sorry, Dan.

457
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:58,806
- What are you, a frat boy?
- I got your phone.

458
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:01,225
- Timeout.
- Ah! Timeout.

459
00:26:01,309 --> 00:26:03,561
- Give that back! Yes.
- Keep-away? Are we doing this?

460
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:06,272
Toss it to me, Emily!
Toss it to me!

461
00:26:07,148 --> 00:26:10,234
Your Japanese is so terrific.

462
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:11,902
- You speak Japanese?
- Well, no.

463
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:14,196
But I don't have to speak Japanese

464
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:17,241
to see how beautiful
you are when you speak it.

465
00:26:17,325 --> 00:26:20,411
Don't go out there! Don't go out there!
Come back this way.

466
00:26:20,495 --> 00:26:24,456
- Yeah, I'm their favorite uncle.
- How old are they?

467
00:26:26,209 --> 00:26:29,211
- How old do you think they are?
- Um...

468
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:34,883
- Seven?
- Seven! Yeah. You're good.

469
00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:36,844
- Fraternal twins?
- Is there any other kind?

470
00:26:40,515 --> 00:26:43,267
Oh, jeez. When you're around
kids as much as I am,

471
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:45,603
you got to develop a sense of humor.

472
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:48,230
- But it's rewarding, too.
- Hmm...

473
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:51,108
Do you like the beach,
"favorite uncle" Charlie?

474
00:26:51,192 --> 00:26:52,192
Love!

475
00:26:53,528 --> 00:26:55,613
Why don't you come
to Westport on Saturday.

476
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:57,364
I'm going to meet some friends
at their beach house.

477
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:59,033
You can even bring
your niece and nephew.

478
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:02,411
Well, I just may do that,
"beautiful translator" Amanda.

479
00:27:05,081 --> 00:27:07,374
Go camping,
learn how to ride a two-wheeler,

480
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:11,462
my first pro baseball game,
refinish a deck and surfing.

481
00:27:11,546 --> 00:27:13,088
That's my Dad List.

482
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:17,051
That sounds great.
Pull up your hoods, OK?

483
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:20,304
- Put these on, all right?
- Why?

484
00:27:20,388 --> 00:27:23,140
Technically, you're not supposed
to be here, let alone living here.

485
00:27:23,224 --> 00:27:25,351
But we're going to have
a lot of fun. Let's go.

486
00:27:32,233 --> 00:27:33,484
Dan?

487
00:27:33,568 --> 00:27:35,694
Ooh! Betty. Hide! Go, go!

488
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:37,780
- Dan, is that you?
- Hey, Betty!

489
00:27:37,864 --> 00:27:41,659
- Hi! You are looking good.
- You, too, baby.

490
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:44,495
What's all that racket?

491
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:46,872
I don't know. Maybe immigrants.
I'm not sure.

492
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:48,332
Raccoons, most likely.

493
00:27:48,416 --> 00:27:50,584
No... Oh, my God, I see kids!

494
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:52,795
- No, these are my...
- I see kids!

495
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:59,301
Why don't you put them in a hotel?
They would love room service.

496
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:02,012
They'd also love a spa,
but we can't... Don't run! Careful!

497
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:04,932
- Don't touch that!
- Easy. Slow down! No running!

498
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:07,017
Watch out! A lot of expensive things...

499
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:08,727
- Are you out of your mind?
- Why?

500
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:09,853
Come on!

501
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:12,147
Listen. You're the one
that forced me into that place.

502
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:15,526
- I cajoled you, I cajoled you.
- Don't give me semantics.

503
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:17,319
Look, they're going upstairs now!

504
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:21,865
This is my crib, man!
This is where I get down.

505
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:25,369
This is where I sink the three points.
This is where I throw the TD.

506
00:28:25,453 --> 00:28:27,579
This isn't for kids, man.

507
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:30,874
Look, that pool out there,
that's got a 15-foot deep end.

508
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:34,336
Look at this place! I got
pointy-edged furniture. I got...

509
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:36,296
Those spears probably
still have poison on them.

510
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:38,132
You don't want them in this house.

511
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:43,512
I do not lead a child-safe life, man!

512
00:28:43,596 --> 00:28:45,806
It is not... not how I roll. You know?

513
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:47,725
Charlie...

514
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:50,227
- I'm barely treading water here.
- Aw, don't...

515
00:28:50,311 --> 00:28:52,813
I don't know these kids very long,
but I'm still their dad.

516
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:56,859
And they need a home. And so do I.

517
00:28:56,943 --> 00:28:59,194
Right now,
you're the closest thing we got.

518
00:29:06,327 --> 00:29:08,370
Thanks, bro. You're the best.

519
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:12,750
OK. You went emotional and it paid off.

520
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:14,710
- Good.
- This time.

521
00:29:14,794 --> 00:29:16,086
OK.

522
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:22,050
Oh, it's Vicki! Kids!

523
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:25,220
Well, first everybody thought
Dad was our grandpa.

524
00:29:25,305 --> 00:29:28,891
Then he pretty much worked
the rest of the day.

525
00:29:28,975 --> 00:29:32,019
"Everything is fine. "

526
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:35,689
And he did say he was going to do
the first thing on Zach's Dad List.

527
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:38,859
That sounds promising. See?
This is gonna be great.

528
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:40,110
Here's Dad.

529
00:29:41,529 --> 00:29:43,572
Hey, Vic. Didn't she sound wonderful?

530
00:29:43,656 --> 00:29:45,949
- How's everything going?
- I'm OK.

531
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:48,285
Don't you worry a moment
about how things are going here

532
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:50,704
because everything's going great.

533
00:29:52,582 --> 00:29:56,084
OK, you guys... lights out.

534
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:58,629
OK.

535
00:29:58,713 --> 00:30:01,256
Alrighty. There you go.

536
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:04,343
- You have your creature? Good.
- I do.

537
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:09,014
- You OK?
- Mm-hm.

538
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:11,475
Good night.

539
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:40,003
I just shook my daughter's hand
good night.

540
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:44,633
I'm no good at this, Charlie.

541
00:30:44,717 --> 00:30:47,803
Come on. You're trying.
That's what matters.

542
00:30:47,887 --> 00:30:48,887
Thanks.

543
00:30:54,477 --> 00:30:56,228
They are cute, though.

544
00:30:56,312 --> 00:31:01,483
Yeah. They are when they're
in a... dormant configuration.

545
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:14,872
Whoo-wee! Look at this, Nick!

546
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:25,465
- Ready for the other one?
- Don't get drill happy.

547
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:27,217
No, no, no. It's all good.

548
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:29,177
Hey!

549
00:31:31,264 --> 00:31:33,974
- What are you doing?
- Sir, it's cool.

550
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:36,977
That's Nick and I'm Gary.
We're the childproofers.

551
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:39,396
- Really?
- I'm going to need access

552
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,982
to all your personal drawers and stuff.

553
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:46,570
- Dan! Dan! Did you do this?
- Charlie!

554
00:31:46,654 --> 00:31:48,238
- Oh, yeah.
- Did you bring them in?

555
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:49,698
- Definitely.
- Why?

556
00:31:49,782 --> 00:31:52,075
You described this house as being
a dangerous place for kids,

557
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,036
so I hired the best
childproofers there are.

558
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:57,247
The tall guy over there,
he was a civil engineer.

559
00:31:57,332 --> 00:31:59,833
What kind of a civil engineer
would be baby-proofing a house?

560
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:06,506
Failed one, sir,
I'm a failed civil engineer.

561
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:10,552
I got a lot of bad road
behind me. Lot of potholes.

562
00:32:10,637 --> 00:32:13,680
That's why I'm going to be extra
vigilant in protecting your children.

563
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:15,515
They're seven. And they're his kids.

564
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,351
- That's true.
- That's progressive,

565
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:19,102
- and I'm all for it.
- Oh, come on!

566
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:23,023
Even I know you do not baby-proof
a house for seven-year-olds.

567
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:25,233
- Oh!
- What about the 15-foot deep end?

568
00:32:25,318 --> 00:32:27,778
Sir, you got a flamethrower
for a fireplace.

569
00:32:27,862 --> 00:32:30,280
- It's a fashion. It's a style.
- The spears?

570
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:32,115
What guy buys poison-tipped spears?

571
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:35,243
A thousand years ago they were poison.
I don't know if they're poison now.

572
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:37,120
You bought those a thousand years ago?

573
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:40,415
- Expect me to believe that?
- You designed this house of horrors.

574
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:43,627
You brought the kids to this house.
Stop it! Don't eat that.

575
00:32:43,711 --> 00:32:45,128
Those are dog treats.

576
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:49,299
Everything tastes like dog food
after that smoked salmon I just had.

577
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:50,550
You ate the salmon?

578
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:56,056
- That was a gift.
- Yes, it was.

579
00:32:58,768 --> 00:33:01,144
- You guys better pack.
- Pack?

580
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:03,355
- Why are you dressed like that?
- What do we pack for?

581
00:33:03,439 --> 00:33:05,649
Camping.
That's first on my Dad List.

582
00:33:05,733 --> 00:33:09,027
And we're Pioneers, so you
have to find the nearest campground.

583
00:33:09,112 --> 00:33:12,239
We have 50 files of Nishamura
work to do before Saturday.

584
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:15,450
Guys, camping...
I don't think we can do it.

585
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:17,828
- But you promised!
- I know I promised,

586
00:33:17,912 --> 00:33:22,040
but I didn't realize camping involved a
camping trip, and we have to reschedule.

587
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:24,459
- But you promised.
- Sometimes promises

588
00:33:24,544 --> 00:33:27,879
- aren't written in stone.
- But you promised!

589
00:33:47,608 --> 00:33:52,154
We've been a Pioneer family
for four generations now.

590
00:33:52,238 --> 00:33:56,283
I practically grew up in these woods
following Grandpa Ted.

591
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:59,494
Gramps was troop leader 63 years ago,

592
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:03,540
and was the recipient of the
supreme Pioneer honor.

593
00:34:03,624 --> 00:34:06,418
Interred for eternity...

594
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:13,592
...in a tomb erected with his own hands,

595
00:34:13,676 --> 00:34:16,636
right here on this...
on this very campsite.

596
00:34:21,809 --> 00:34:23,560
Not in front of the kids.

597
00:34:23,644 --> 00:34:27,105
Hey. Hey. Psst.

598
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:31,818
Hey! You remind me of that
old dude who stole my girlfriend.

599
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:34,988
- What?
- I promised myself...

600
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:37,199
Yeah, you. You! Mr. Wall-of-Hair.

601
00:34:37,283 --> 00:34:39,826
Rick, you're a counselor here.
This is sacred ground.

602
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:42,496
- Something I got to tell you.
- The Pioneers have meant

603
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:48,001
the world to the Taylor clan.
That's who I am.

604
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:51,922
Troop leader. Patriot. TSA supervisor.

605
00:34:52,006 --> 00:34:55,759
And dad. I am Barry Taylor.

606
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:03,600
Gentlemen, why don't we
put down the electronic devices,

607
00:35:03,684 --> 00:35:05,727
and try to get into it a little bit?

608
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:11,691
Hmm? After all...
we're here for the kids.

609
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:14,236
Fine.

610
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:17,364
Sorry.

611
00:35:23,037 --> 00:35:24,788
Here for the kids?
What's he talking about?

612
00:35:24,872 --> 00:35:27,082
OK, kids. Who wants to have some fun?

613
00:35:27,166 --> 00:35:28,875
Yeah!

614
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:32,045
Let's go dig a hole.

615
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:34,381
- What's your problem?
- How about we go dig a hole.

616
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:36,133
He's giving me the stink eye.

617
00:35:36,217 --> 00:35:40,053
You thief. I loved her.
I loved her so much.

618
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:42,055
- What are you saying?
- My beef is not with you, old woman.

619
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,432
Thank you.

620
00:35:44,517 --> 00:35:48,311
- OK, now I got it.
- He has a lot.

621
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:55,652
Hey, Zach, Emily.
Why don't you get your grandpa

622
00:35:55,736 --> 00:35:57,487
to leave the office...

623
00:35:57,572 --> 00:35:59,489
...and come over here
and join us in the woods?

624
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:01,867
He's not our grandpa, he's our dad.

625
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:12,169
Sure, Zach. My grandpa
was like a dad to me, too.

626
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:16,506
He is, Troop Master Barry.
He's my dad, and that's his partner.

627
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:19,342
- It's like we have two dads!
- Just found out.

628
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:21,386
Trust me. It was a surprise.

629
00:36:21,929 --> 00:36:24,014
- Been together 30 years.
- Feels like 50.

630
00:36:25,474 --> 00:36:28,059
- Oh, well...
- We're soul mates, really.

631
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:31,021
You must have a best buddy.

632
00:36:31,105 --> 00:36:33,148
Yeah. A pal?
Someone you can...

633
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:36,067
- Fine.
- Take care.

634
00:36:36,152 --> 00:36:37,694
- Loner.
- Loner.

635
00:36:37,778 --> 00:36:39,279
- Loser!
- Loser.

636
00:36:41,115 --> 00:36:43,742
- No bears allowed.
- Thank you, Troop Master Barry.

637
00:36:43,826 --> 00:36:47,078
- Thanks.
- No trouble at all, kids.

638
00:36:47,163 --> 00:36:49,497
You ladies ready to play
a little Ultimate Frisbee?

639
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:52,334
- I think so, Mr. Testosterone.
- Yeah.

640
00:36:52,418 --> 00:36:54,377
Ultimate Frisbee?
That's our game.

641
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:58,506
- Let's do this for our kids, huh?
- Yeah!

642
00:36:58,591 --> 00:37:01,551
Come on, man. Let's do it.
Yeah, for the kids. Yeah, baby.

643
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:03,678
All right, let's do this.
Sports marketing!

644
00:37:03,763 --> 00:37:06,598
Sports marketing! Yeah!
Make the deal. Get them!

645
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:11,811
- That's bear scat, gentlemen.
- Yeah... Yeah, it is.

646
00:37:12,855 --> 00:37:14,397
- Dad?
- Yeah?

647
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:16,066
I think "scat" is poop.

648
00:37:17,109 --> 00:37:19,236
- Really, son?
- Yeah.

649
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:22,239
- You wiped poop on my face?
- Yeah.

650
00:37:23,282 --> 00:37:25,033
Scat happens, man.

651
00:37:38,297 --> 00:37:41,925
One, two, three, four,

652
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:45,428
five, six, seven, eight...

653
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:58,692
Aah...

654
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:08,910
Go long!

655
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:18,795
Yes! Yeah, baby!

656
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:20,547
Barry! I'm over here, I'm open!

657
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:26,428
- Hey!
- I'm open!

658
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:31,474
- Oh!
- Get...

659
00:38:35,229 --> 00:38:41,192
- Sorry.
- Ow, my gums!

660
00:38:42,903 --> 00:38:45,280
You get your wingman to fight
your battles for you?

661
00:38:45,364 --> 00:38:47,824
- I didn't take your woman.
- I'm a man.

662
00:38:47,908 --> 00:38:50,994
- I don't know your woman!
- First you steal Janice Applebaum.

663
00:38:51,078 --> 00:38:53,621
- You're confused!
- Then you steal my soul.

664
00:38:53,706 --> 00:38:57,083
- What?
- Now it's on, smiley.

665
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:59,711
Prison rules!

666
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:03,590
- Prison rules?
- Oh, boy.

667
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:10,930
Whoo!

668
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:13,850
Come on, Dad. You can get up.

669
00:39:15,811 --> 00:39:17,479
Never mind.

670
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:21,274
Back, back, back, back.

671
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:22,442
Time out.

672
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:25,362
Ah!

673
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:28,656
Get off of me!

674
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:39,626
Stay down, gentle warrior.

675
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:42,462
Ooh...

676
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:48,426
Pull.

677
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:54,015
- Textbook double bull's eye.
- Nice, Barry.

678
00:39:55,226 --> 00:40:00,063
That's how you get yourself a chest
full of merit patches. Anyone else?

679
00:40:00,689 --> 00:40:02,273
Pull!

680
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:07,695
- Barry...
- I said... pull!

681
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:20,166
My bad!

682
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:23,711
No!

683
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:27,924
- Grandpa Ted!
- We should get our merit patches

684
00:40:28,008 --> 00:40:31,803
- just for being his kids.
- Sorry! How bad is it?

685
00:40:31,887 --> 00:40:33,805
- Bad!
- OK.

686
00:40:45,025 --> 00:40:48,111
As a result of your
little outdoor adventure,

687
00:40:48,195 --> 00:40:51,406
I just want you to know
that my sciatica has flared up,

688
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:52,866
and I stink like a steakhouse.

689
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:54,409
- So thanks.
- Oh, you're welcome.

690
00:40:54,493 --> 00:40:55,785
Don't mind the fact that I took

691
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:58,079
a three-day camping trip
and shortened it to nine hours.

692
00:40:58,164 --> 00:41:01,749
- I made fire! Wow!
- Oh, no!

693
00:41:02,251 --> 00:41:04,961
That's not good. Get the car ready.

694
00:41:05,045 --> 00:41:08,298
Little collateral damage,
but we're back on track with the deal.

695
00:41:08,382 --> 00:41:11,384
Now it's all about the golfgame.
How's your back?

696
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:13,303
- Tight.
- Untighten it.

697
00:41:13,387 --> 00:41:16,347
Because Nishamura uses golf
as a metaphor for life.

698
00:41:16,432 --> 00:41:19,309
So if you mess that up,
it's sayonara, Nishamura.

699
00:41:20,227 --> 00:41:24,147
- One of my little magic pills.
- My housekeeper happens to

700
00:41:24,231 --> 00:41:27,025
arrange them in an organized
circular fashion, like so.

701
00:41:27,109 --> 00:41:28,902
- Pardon-moi.
- Yes.

702
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:31,738
That's amazing.
When did we become our fathers?

703
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:33,573
Man, I'd like to see Troop Leader Barry

704
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:35,617
deal with the side effects
of even one of these puppies.

705
00:41:35,701 --> 00:41:38,077
Look at this. For my aging prostate.

706
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:39,829
- Right.
- Side effects include

707
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:43,291
swollen tongue, dry mouth
and pus-filled canker sores.

708
00:41:43,375 --> 00:41:45,752
- Come on.
- This is a joint anti-inflammatory.

709
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:49,005
Maximum dosage may cause bouts
of uncontrollable appetite.

710
00:41:49,089 --> 00:41:51,341
That's not so bad. The munchies.
I could deal with that.

711
00:41:51,425 --> 00:41:53,259
Look at this one. High blood pressure.

712
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:56,095
"Watch out for sudden loss
of depth perception. "

713
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:59,224
This tiny pill lowers
your bad cholesterol.

714
00:41:59,308 --> 00:42:02,227
But the first time I took it,
partial facial paralysis.

715
00:42:02,311 --> 00:42:04,938
- Come on.
- I froze up like a circus clown.

716
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:06,189
- I was, like, "Ha. "
- You're kidding.

717
00:42:06,273 --> 00:42:07,607
Yeah, like...

718
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:11,486
- Threw my back out.
- Man...

719
00:42:13,447 --> 00:42:16,032
- How much longerwe got?
- One week, four days, nine hours.

720
00:42:16,116 --> 00:42:20,161
- Mmm... Good Lord.
- God help us all.

721
00:42:22,122 --> 00:42:24,707
Hey, Dad, I'm in
desperate need of a King Fontana.

722
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:26,584
- You want to play?
- My doctor says that

723
00:42:26,669 --> 00:42:29,128
I can't get down on the floor,
even crouch, on a golf day.

724
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:32,006
It seems I have a genetic
predisposition to knee problems.

725
00:42:32,091 --> 00:42:35,051
That means you have it, too.
So you have to be very careful.

726
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:36,678
Nick, I told you not to use epoxy.

727
00:42:36,762 --> 00:42:39,222
It's going to leave a
permanent stain and an odor.

728
00:42:39,306 --> 00:42:42,392
Why can't you ever
tell me I did a good job?

729
00:42:42,476 --> 00:42:44,394
All right, maestro, how do I do this?

730
00:42:44,478 --> 00:42:49,065
Um, OK... You want to go
quarter turn clockwise,

731
00:42:49,149 --> 00:42:52,569
grab the lever, then use the
counter lever to spin 180 degrees...

732
00:42:52,653 --> 00:42:54,904
Why are you
charging that in here?

733
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:58,825
I keep getting in Dad's way.
He can't do any business in here, right?

734
00:42:58,909 --> 00:43:01,452
Release like that, and voilà.

735
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:06,749
Check if they
have kids' toothpaste.

736
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:09,127
That old people stuff burns my...

737
00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:16,009
- Should we tell?
- I think I rememberwhere they go.

738
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:18,928
We'll put this one in...

739
00:43:19,013 --> 00:43:22,056
- This one in here.
- Put them in here.

740
00:43:35,821 --> 00:43:37,947
Ooh... Mmm.

741
00:43:56,759 --> 00:43:58,343
What am I doing? They're guys.

742
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:07,727
OK, guys, let's go!
Are you guys still hungry?

743
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:09,771
- We just ate.
- So did you.

744
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:11,522
I know, but I'm starved.

745
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:26,454
That's weird. Hmm.

746
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:29,290
Do you have candy bars on you?
Don't lie to me.

747
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:31,167
- What's wrong with him?
- I don't know.

748
00:44:31,251 --> 00:44:33,670
- Hey!
- Hey! You made it.

749
00:44:33,754 --> 00:44:36,255
- We made it. Yeah.
- Can we go play?

750
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:38,841
Go ahead. There's games
over there. Check it out.

751
00:44:39,593 --> 00:44:41,177
Catch you later.

752
00:44:45,974 --> 00:44:49,519
- Oh!
- Wow. You got a lot offriends.

753
00:44:49,603 --> 00:44:51,979
Oh, well, they're not
actually all my friends.

754
00:44:52,064 --> 00:44:53,856
It's a bereavement group I belong to.

755
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:55,400
- Bereavement?
- Yeah.

756
00:44:55,484 --> 00:44:57,485
My grandma passed away six months ago.

757
00:44:57,569 --> 00:44:59,904
- I'm sorry.
- Everyone here is dealing with loss.

758
00:44:59,988 --> 00:45:01,948
And then on the weekends
we have a potluck.

759
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:04,784
Potluck? Where?

760
00:45:05,994 --> 00:45:08,162
Mr. Nishamura. It's an honor.

761
00:45:11,166 --> 00:45:13,167
- Nice to meet you.
- You, too.

762
00:45:13,836 --> 00:45:14,836
Oh.

763
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:17,922
- My son, Riku.
- Riku.

764
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:22,009
- Yeah, hey. Hey. Hey...
- Hey. Hey. Hey.

765
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:24,011
Oh!

766
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:30,977
Thank you.

767
00:45:36,108 --> 00:45:38,192
Tongue is swollen.

768
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:43,823
We are dedicating lunch today
to our brave Justine,

769
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:47,326
who passed awayjust two days ago.

770
00:45:47,411 --> 00:45:50,913
Voicemail. No! Charlie, it's me.

771
00:45:50,998 --> 00:45:53,499
I think we switch peers.

772
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:55,084
I love cupcakes!

773
00:45:55,169 --> 00:46:00,173
She left us a gift of one of her
world-famous rhubarb pies,

774
00:46:00,257 --> 00:46:05,762
that she baked through her pain
of the last few hours of her life.

775
00:46:05,846 --> 00:46:11,017
- Good mercy!
- No talk. Nishamura. Call me.

776
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:14,854
Are you ready?

777
00:46:18,484 --> 00:46:21,027
That's Justine's rhubarb pie!

778
00:46:21,111 --> 00:46:24,280
Where is she?
I want to give Justine a big hug.

779
00:46:24,364 --> 00:46:28,701
- She's dead.
- My condolences.

780
00:46:28,786 --> 00:46:31,204
She's dead!

781
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:39,337
She's dead! She's dead!
Give me it! Dead! She's dead!

782
00:46:39,421 --> 00:46:41,464
That's a close second.

783
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:46,010
Ooh... Ah!

784
00:46:50,974 --> 00:46:53,476
- Is my face twitching?
- You look great.

785
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:56,103
You look... great.

786
00:46:56,188 --> 00:46:58,314
Charlie? Are you OK?

787
00:46:58,398 --> 00:47:01,150
I am so sorry about
that whole pie thing.

788
00:47:01,235 --> 00:47:03,653
It must be my blood sugar or something.

789
00:47:03,737 --> 00:47:06,030
It's OK. I think I calmed them down.

790
00:47:06,114 --> 00:47:07,782
Come on. We're having circle time.

791
00:47:07,866 --> 00:47:10,535
- Circle time?
- It's when the whole group

792
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:12,161
gathers and shares their grief.

793
00:47:12,246 --> 00:47:16,916
Oh... Guys, I'll be back.
I got to go to circle time.

794
00:47:23,298 --> 00:47:25,842
- Um... Hey, Dan?
- Hmm?

795
00:47:25,926 --> 00:47:30,680
How are you doing? I recently put down
$3,000 on an authentic Japanese kimono.

796
00:47:33,725 --> 00:47:35,309
I just want to make sure it goes OK.

797
00:47:48,907 --> 00:47:52,368
Aah... Aah...

798
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:04,088
Dan-san, would you like to use my club?

799
00:48:06,133 --> 00:48:08,134
Is that a "yes"?

800
00:48:08,218 --> 00:48:11,512
- Why is he ignoring my father?
- No, he's just really intense.

801
00:48:11,597 --> 00:48:16,684
He excludes all but the game.
A focus you could learn, my son.

802
00:48:26,445 --> 00:48:29,322
- Ooh...
- I knew it. Oh, gosh.

803
00:48:29,406 --> 00:48:33,409
Breathe. Just breathe through it.
Walk it off. Walk it off.

804
00:48:33,493 --> 00:48:35,077
We're good. We're good.
Just take a shot.

805
00:48:35,162 --> 00:48:37,705
It just passes, and then...
And then it comes back.

806
00:48:37,789 --> 00:48:42,543
After nine months of excruciating pain,

807
00:48:42,628 --> 00:48:47,673
- the cancer had spread.
- We're all here for you.

808
00:48:52,012 --> 00:48:55,681
- Do you think this is funny?
- He thinks it's funny.

809
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:57,600
Everybody grieves in their own way.

810
00:48:57,684 --> 00:48:59,852
- That's true.
- If I don't laugh, I'll cry.

811
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:18,454
The golf gods look favorably upon you.

812
00:49:18,538 --> 00:49:22,083
This is a very good omen.

813
00:49:33,387 --> 00:49:35,096
That was some delicious pie.

814
00:49:50,737 --> 00:49:53,114
Dan, have you
seen the Nishamura file?

815
00:49:53,198 --> 00:49:56,242
Hey Dad, maybe tomorrow you can
teach me how to ride a two-wheel.

816
00:49:56,326 --> 00:49:57,994
I got a lot on my mind right now.

817
00:49:58,078 --> 00:50:00,162
I'm trying to focus,
finish this business deal.

818
00:50:00,247 --> 00:50:02,498
Come on, Dad. You're not even trying.

819
00:50:02,582 --> 00:50:07,503
I'm struggling, OK? That's like trying,
it just... without succeeding.

820
00:50:15,595 --> 00:50:18,055
Oh, come on.
He unplugged the fax machine.

821
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:20,808
Two open plugs and he has
to unplug the fax machine

822
00:50:20,892 --> 00:50:23,811
- to plug in his little gaming system.
- Big deal. Come on.

823
00:50:23,895 --> 00:50:26,272
You can't run a business
if you can't get faxes on time.

824
00:50:26,356 --> 00:50:28,399
This is the reason
I didn't want to have kids.

825
00:50:32,154 --> 00:50:33,988
I wasn't talking about you, Zach.

826
00:50:37,826 --> 00:50:39,326
Hey, Zach.

827
00:50:40,287 --> 00:50:43,539
Hey, Zach. Zach...

828
00:50:44,791 --> 00:50:46,792
Zachary!

829
00:51:00,348 --> 00:51:04,226
I defaced a venerated monument,
literally. Burned down a campground.

830
00:51:04,311 --> 00:51:07,438
My son, for all intents and
purposes, is giving up on me.

831
00:51:07,522 --> 00:51:09,607
I'm failing them everywhere I look.

832
00:51:09,691 --> 00:51:13,110
Emily, one minute she
wants me to be a superhero,

833
00:51:13,195 --> 00:51:16,989
- the next minute a lion, then a king.
- Then be a king, you idiot!

834
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:20,117
Be a superhero, be a lion,
be whatever she wants.

835
00:51:21,703 --> 00:51:24,830
Don't you get it? She just
wants someone to protect her.

836
00:51:26,333 --> 00:51:28,501
- That's it?
- Yes.

837
00:51:28,585 --> 00:51:31,253
You have to be on their level.
Be like them.

838
00:51:31,338 --> 00:51:33,672
You know what my dad gave me
for my fifth birthday?

839
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:36,175
- What?
- A calculator.

840
00:51:37,511 --> 00:51:40,429
I don't know what it is about me

841
00:51:40,514 --> 00:51:44,600
that sees you in a crisis and then
comes galloping to your rescue.

842
00:51:44,684 --> 00:51:46,894
But I guess I am who I am, aren't I?

843
00:51:49,189 --> 00:51:51,732
You need help connecting
with these kids?

844
00:51:51,817 --> 00:51:53,359
I'm going to find you help.

845
00:51:57,864 --> 00:52:01,534
Jimmy! Jimmy! Jimmy!

846
00:52:26,643 --> 00:52:27,935
- Whoo!
- Rocked it, baby.

847
00:52:28,019 --> 00:52:29,979
Ladies, beautiful as always.

848
00:52:30,063 --> 00:52:31,981
- Jimmy Mac!
- Charlie!

849
00:52:32,065 --> 00:52:34,316
- Yeah, brother!
- What's up? Charlie, look at you!

850
00:52:34,401 --> 00:52:35,651
- Meet my friend, Dan.
- Hey.

851
00:52:35,735 --> 00:52:38,362
Tell me you felt it.
Did you feel it, man?

852
00:52:38,446 --> 00:52:40,030
- Was it electrifying?
- Electrifying.

853
00:52:40,115 --> 00:52:41,448
Wham, bam, thank you, ma'am.

854
00:52:41,533 --> 00:52:44,160
Like chocolate milk coming
through the nose, baby! Yeah!

855
00:52:44,244 --> 00:52:46,745
Two shows tomorrow, everybody.
So what's going on?

856
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:48,247
- I was gonna ask you a favor.
- What you need?

857
00:52:48,331 --> 00:52:50,499
Remember at Wade's party
you were talking about

858
00:52:50,584 --> 00:52:53,919
a human puppeteer, this mechanism?
You got that done?

859
00:52:54,004 --> 00:52:56,172
When I was talking to you in confidence?

860
00:52:56,256 --> 00:52:59,133
- Yeah.
- You always had that problem.

861
00:52:59,217 --> 00:53:02,261
This man is in trouble. He has trouble
relating to his own children.

862
00:53:02,345 --> 00:53:03,888
- Oh, my God.
- He needs your help.

863
00:53:03,972 --> 00:53:05,681
With your technology, we can fix this.

864
00:53:05,765 --> 00:53:07,183
- Oh, thank you.
- It's true.

865
00:53:07,267 --> 00:53:09,768
Let me get this right.
You want to hire me

866
00:53:09,853 --> 00:53:12,188
to take this uptight man
and make him a human puppet?

867
00:53:12,272 --> 00:53:14,690
- Yes.
- I'm gonna do it for you.

868
00:53:14,774 --> 00:53:17,693
- Aah!
- Everybody, chop, chop! Whoo!

869
00:53:17,777 --> 00:53:21,530
- I feel so dog gone good here.
- All right. We're good to go.

870
00:53:21,615 --> 00:53:23,949
Now, you told me that your
friend didn't know how to play.

871
00:53:24,034 --> 00:53:26,160
- It's true.
- Dan, now you don't have to.

872
00:53:26,244 --> 00:53:28,787
- Charlie's going to play for you.
- With this suit?

873
00:53:28,872 --> 00:53:31,207
- Yes. Stick this down your pants.
- Why?

874
00:53:31,291 --> 00:53:35,044
That thing will emit such a jolt that it
will literally tickle your funny bone.

875
00:53:48,767 --> 00:53:51,143
This is a proper tea.

876
00:53:52,270 --> 00:53:55,397
Cup. Bring it up.

877
00:53:56,358 --> 00:53:57,441
Pinky.

878
00:53:58,193 --> 00:53:59,360
This is awesome.

879
00:53:59,444 --> 00:54:03,530
Oh, King Fontana,
I do so admire a proper gentleman.

880
00:54:03,615 --> 00:54:08,953
I admire proper gentlemen, too.
I admire them very, very much.

881
00:54:10,163 --> 00:54:12,748
What?

882
00:54:14,668 --> 00:54:17,503
That was a good cup of tea.

883
00:54:17,587 --> 00:54:21,006
Why, thank you. As princess of the land,
I have made it specially.

884
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:24,593
- It is poo-poo flavored.
- She's cute.

885
00:54:24,678 --> 00:54:28,013
- He didn't laugh. Make him laugh.
- Watch this.

886
00:54:30,934 --> 00:54:35,104
Laugh, puppet. Laugh, laugh.

887
00:54:50,870 --> 00:54:54,456
"Here with my board. Have questions. "

888
00:54:54,541 --> 00:54:57,376
Cool. I have my board, too.

889
00:55:13,810 --> 00:55:17,896
"Nissan has been our marketing partner
in racing for many years. "

890
00:55:19,357 --> 00:55:23,819
"Nissan is poop. "

891
00:55:33,121 --> 00:55:34,997
Ah, ah.

892
00:55:35,081 --> 00:55:40,627
Strong words. You suggest we sever ties?

893
00:55:40,712 --> 00:55:42,504
Racecars. Cool.

894
00:55:42,589 --> 00:55:46,175
"... but robots are cooler. "

895
00:55:46,259 --> 00:55:49,511
How could he know we're exploring
a major push in that field?

896
00:55:56,561 --> 00:55:59,938
"This is boring. I'm leaving now. "

897
00:56:01,608 --> 00:56:04,526
- Fearless, this one.
- Spin him.

898
00:56:04,611 --> 00:56:07,905
- Whoa!
- Spin him. Spin him again.

899
00:56:15,497 --> 00:56:17,539
- Too much spin.
- Yeah.

900
00:56:19,709 --> 00:56:20,751
I'm OK.

901
00:56:22,670 --> 00:56:25,839
I told your boy not to get the
battery pack wet. He's on his own.

902
00:56:26,674 --> 00:56:29,093
Sorry, Emily.

903
00:56:34,808 --> 00:56:36,683
Princess?

904
00:56:39,646 --> 00:56:41,480
King Fontana?

905
00:56:44,067 --> 00:56:46,485
Game on.

906
00:56:48,655 --> 00:56:50,489
At your service, my lady.

907
00:56:54,202 --> 00:56:56,412
You know when they found you
after so many years

908
00:56:56,496 --> 00:56:59,248
there were many in my kingdom
who were trepidatious.

909
00:56:59,332 --> 00:57:03,710
- Really hard word.
- Oh. People were scared.

910
00:57:03,795 --> 00:57:08,173
And even most regal I,
your king, was frightened.

911
00:57:08,258 --> 00:57:12,428
- A king who was scared? Ha!
- I know. 'Tis to laugh. Ha...

912
00:57:12,512 --> 00:57:14,138
But 'tis true.

913
00:57:14,222 --> 00:57:17,683
'Tis the reason why
a king may act like a toad.

914
00:57:18,810 --> 00:57:21,270
But the day your king found you,

915
00:57:21,354 --> 00:57:23,981
he vowed to protect you forever.

916
00:57:24,065 --> 00:57:28,193
Even though he didn't know you,
could barely speak your language,

917
00:57:28,278 --> 00:57:31,071
and yes, was a little afraid...

918
00:57:32,365 --> 00:57:37,953
...he vowed to vanquish any and all
who would do you harm in any way.

919
00:57:40,123 --> 00:57:42,040
You know that. Right, Emily?

920
00:57:43,543 --> 00:57:45,794
You know I'll always be there for you.

921
00:57:45,879 --> 00:57:51,341
You're my daughter,
and I will love you forever.

922
00:58:03,938 --> 00:58:06,356
- Are you crying?
- No, I'm not. I'm not crying.

923
00:58:06,441 --> 00:58:12,237
Jimmy Mac, you crying?
Come on, Jimmy.

924
00:58:15,533 --> 00:58:18,160
Your humble servant, madam.

925
00:58:18,244 --> 00:58:20,704
- OK.
- Don't let go, Dad.

926
00:58:20,788 --> 00:58:23,499
This reminds me of an article
I once read in AdvertisingAge,

927
00:58:23,583 --> 00:58:27,503
which talked about the fact
that a loss in a firm's brand assets

928
00:58:27,587 --> 00:58:30,839
is negatively correlated
with increased market valuation.

929
00:58:30,924 --> 00:58:32,591
I don't know what
you're talking about, Dad.

930
00:58:32,675 --> 00:58:35,219
Let's talk about the fact that
you're riding a two-wheeler on your own.

931
00:58:35,303 --> 00:58:39,640
- No hands, baby! No hands!
- I'm doing it, Dad! I'm doing it!

932
00:58:39,724 --> 00:58:42,184
Yeah! You're doing it.

933
00:58:44,771 --> 00:58:46,688
Oh...

934
00:58:48,441 --> 00:58:49,942
Hit it!

935
00:58:52,111 --> 00:58:53,612
Rookies.

936
00:58:57,033 --> 00:58:58,992
There you go. That was awesome.

937
00:59:06,543 --> 00:59:09,044
Hey, look! Look! That's us!

938
00:59:09,587 --> 00:59:11,129
Yeah!

939
00:59:17,095 --> 00:59:21,056
We were most impressed by your
knowledge of our assets base.

940
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:24,810
But ultimately,
it was your robotics idea

941
00:59:24,894 --> 00:59:27,271
that pushed us over the top.

942
00:59:27,355 --> 00:59:29,898
- Robotics?
- Smile and nod.

943
00:59:29,983 --> 00:59:34,570
We here, at NMG, are ready
to go to the next step.

944
00:59:34,654 --> 00:59:40,158
Pack your bag, Craig-san.
You're moving to Tokyo.

945
00:59:50,086 --> 00:59:53,589
I've worked so hard!
It's like I've just been traded!

946
00:59:53,673 --> 00:59:57,551
- We'll translate that later.
- Come on over!

947
00:59:59,596 --> 01:00:02,598
- He's very excited.
- Whoo!

948
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:15,235
Remember, Thursday morning,

949
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:17,446
conference call with
Nishamura and the board.

950
01:00:17,530 --> 01:00:19,615
You set things up,
and we'll take it from there.

951
01:00:19,699 --> 01:00:23,201
Got it. Conference call Thursday,
tee it up for the big guns.

952
01:00:24,287 --> 01:00:26,288
I just want to say thanks, you guys.

953
01:00:26,372 --> 01:00:29,708
Nobody's ever really believed
in me the way that you two have.

954
01:00:29,792 --> 01:00:32,836
And it really means a lot to me.
You guys are like...

955
01:00:34,756 --> 01:00:38,550
You're like the two dads that I
never had. I really appreciate it.

956
01:00:39,177 --> 01:00:43,221
My two father figures.
I'm going to do you proud.

957
01:00:43,306 --> 01:00:46,892
- All right.
- Go To.

958
01:00:46,976 --> 01:00:48,977
- You don't want to be late.
- Whoo!

959
01:00:49,062 --> 01:00:52,272
Look out, Japan. Here comes
some serious business.

960
01:01:04,327 --> 01:01:06,161
Oh, God help us.

961
01:01:06,245 --> 01:01:09,289
It was so cool, Mom.
Dad taught me how to ride a two-wheeler,

962
01:01:09,374 --> 01:01:12,459
and then we got to hang out
with the New York Mets!

963
01:01:12,543 --> 01:01:15,796
Let me talk to her.
And Dad promised that he'd

964
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:18,048
do something huge
for our birthday this year.

965
01:01:18,132 --> 01:01:19,800
But he won't even tell us what it is.

966
01:01:19,884 --> 01:01:21,635
- Let me say hi to him.
- OK.

967
01:01:21,719 --> 01:01:24,805
Hey. I'm coming to get you tomorrow.
No arguments.

968
01:01:24,889 --> 01:01:26,973
Tomorrow morning, I have
the biggest conference call

969
01:01:27,058 --> 01:01:29,810
in my entire career,
but after that I'm all yours.

970
01:01:29,894 --> 01:01:33,188
It's amazing. I left the kids
with you out of desperation,

971
01:01:33,272 --> 01:01:35,774
but now I can't imagine
having done it differently.

972
01:01:36,192 --> 01:01:37,484
Me too.

973
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:30,120
Oh, great. This is a record.

974
01:02:30,204 --> 01:02:33,790
He unplugged a laptop,
BlackBerry, lamp, an alarm cl...

975
01:02:35,835 --> 01:02:37,252
- Charlie!
- What?

976
01:02:37,336 --> 01:02:38,670
- What?!
- Conference call.

977
01:02:41,090 --> 01:02:42,382
- Let's go!
- No, no, no.

978
01:02:42,467 --> 01:02:44,342
- My notes!
- No time!

979
01:02:46,763 --> 01:02:52,184
- In three, two, one...
- Kids! In the car!

980
01:02:55,646 --> 01:02:58,565
Just a second... Good...

981
01:03:00,943 --> 01:03:02,444
Nishamura-san.

982
01:03:02,528 --> 01:03:05,113
Please accept our
sincere apology for the delay.

983
01:03:05,198 --> 01:03:08,450
We trust our colleague, Craig,
has already begun the presentation.

984
01:03:08,534 --> 01:03:11,369
I'm afraid your colleague,
Craig, has not been

985
01:03:11,454 --> 01:03:14,456
seen nor heard from
since the moment he arrived.

986
01:03:14,540 --> 01:03:16,792
Really?

987
01:03:16,876 --> 01:03:18,627
He's just a little thing.

988
01:03:18,711 --> 01:03:21,296
He looks more like a little
leprechaun in a business suit.

989
01:03:21,380 --> 01:03:22,589
- You can't miss him.
- Red hair...

990
01:03:22,673 --> 01:03:26,009
He called me from
the Ginza his first night,

991
01:03:26,093 --> 01:03:30,138
and all I heard was...

992
01:03:30,223 --> 01:03:34,267
Techno music... and something about
the teachings of a karaoke master.

993
01:03:37,230 --> 01:03:39,314
♪ Hey-hey

994
01:03:39,398 --> 01:03:42,317
Ai! Ai! Ai!

995
01:03:42,401 --> 01:03:44,903
- Ah...
- Dan-san.

996
01:03:44,987 --> 01:03:49,658
I have the utmost respect for you,
but an hour delay

997
01:03:49,742 --> 01:03:53,995
and a missing executive is not the way
to begin a relationship.

998
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:55,831
We will do anything
to make it work out.

999
01:03:55,915 --> 01:03:58,166
We are there for you,
Nishamura-san, 24/7.

1000
01:03:58,251 --> 01:04:03,588
Good. That is what I hoped to hear.
So, if we are to move forward

1001
01:04:03,673 --> 01:04:08,260
you and Charlie are the ones
who must move here to Tokyo

1002
01:04:08,344 --> 01:04:10,554
and be our liaison.

1003
01:04:10,638 --> 01:04:15,433
That is my final and only offer.

1004
01:04:22,108 --> 01:04:25,861
OK... Let's do this.
Let's do this. Just do it.

1005
01:04:32,159 --> 01:04:35,120
- Thank you. Oh!
- Hey.

1006
01:04:35,204 --> 01:04:38,373
Oh! Freedom. I can smell the air again.

1007
01:04:40,376 --> 01:04:42,544
- How are the kids?
- Great.

1008
01:04:42,628 --> 01:04:44,546
- Maybe we should get going.
- OK.

1009
01:04:46,257 --> 01:04:50,760
I just went with the motto, "Don't
serve the time, let the time serve you. "

1010
01:04:51,596 --> 01:04:55,891
The truth is, Dan, most of what
I was reflecting on was us.

1011
01:04:55,975 --> 01:04:57,392
Really?

1012
01:04:57,476 --> 01:04:59,936
And the way you've proven yourself
to me with the kids.

1013
01:05:00,897 --> 01:05:02,898
- Bless you.
- Our kids.

1014
01:05:02,982 --> 01:05:07,235
- Yeah.
- Maybe you were right two weeks ago.

1015
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:09,446
Maybe it is time to give us another try.

1016
01:05:11,324 --> 01:05:13,742
Really?

1017
01:05:13,826 --> 01:05:15,452
Timing.

1018
01:05:15,536 --> 01:05:17,245
- Timing's perfect.
- Timing.

1019
01:05:17,330 --> 01:05:19,205
- Wow.
- Wow.

1020
01:05:30,426 --> 01:05:32,510
Where are they?

1021
01:05:33,137 --> 01:05:35,597
- Oh, my babies.
- Mom.

1022
01:05:35,681 --> 01:05:38,850
Oh! I missed you so much.

1023
01:05:38,935 --> 01:05:42,062
All right. I made you guys something.

1024
01:05:42,146 --> 01:05:45,023
Cool!

1025
01:05:45,107 --> 01:05:46,107
Thanks, Mom.

1026
01:05:46,192 --> 01:05:48,276
Don't worry, Charlie.
I didn't forget you.

1027
01:05:48,361 --> 01:05:51,613
I carved you a little soap bunny.

1028
01:05:51,697 --> 01:05:53,114
Oh, Charlie.

1029
01:05:53,199 --> 01:05:55,659
I'll strike that right off
my Christmas list.

1030
01:05:55,743 --> 01:05:59,245
Hey, that's a thoughtful gift.
That's wonderful.

1031
01:06:00,623 --> 01:06:03,124
We need to discuss something,
though, as a family.

1032
01:06:03,209 --> 01:06:05,710
- I'll give you a moment.
- OK.

1033
01:06:13,386 --> 01:06:17,639
When you reappeared in my life, Charlie
and I were in the middle of a deal

1034
01:06:17,723 --> 01:06:20,600
that could be the culmination
of our 30 years in this business.

1035
01:06:21,936 --> 01:06:27,190
But in order to close that deal...
I have to move to Japan.

1036
01:06:28,401 --> 01:06:30,610
What about our birthday? The big party?

1037
01:06:30,695 --> 01:06:33,071
I'm probably going to miss this one.

1038
01:06:33,155 --> 01:06:36,324
But I'm going to try really hard
and come back every six months.

1039
01:06:36,409 --> 01:06:38,994
So I'll make the next one
most likely, you know?

1040
01:06:40,371 --> 01:06:42,455
What about what you said two weeks ago?

1041
01:06:42,540 --> 01:06:44,833
What about trying to make us work?

1042
01:06:44,917 --> 01:06:49,170
I meant that. I really did. But...

1043
01:06:49,255 --> 01:06:53,341
But, Daddy, if you move to Japan,
who will protect the kingdom?

1044
01:06:56,804 --> 01:06:59,389
I know you wanted me
to be a superhero, Emily.

1045
01:06:59,473 --> 01:07:02,183
You all wanted me to be one.

1046
01:07:02,268 --> 01:07:04,894
But I'm not. I wish I could be.

1047
01:07:04,979 --> 01:07:07,772
I'd fly back and forth
from Japan every day.

1048
01:07:11,318 --> 01:07:13,445
I'm just a guy in marketing.

1049
01:07:18,451 --> 01:07:20,577
I'm going to go pack the kids.

1050
01:07:22,872 --> 01:07:24,497
I'm sorry, you guys.

1051
01:07:39,472 --> 01:07:41,389
- Hello. Thank you.
- May I take your bag?

1052
01:07:41,474 --> 01:07:44,267
Why don't we think of
this deal as our child.

1053
01:07:44,351 --> 01:07:46,811
- Uh-huh.
- Hello. Hi.

1054
01:07:48,355 --> 01:07:51,399
I know you're upset about leaving,
but we're going to fix it, OK?

1055
01:07:51,484 --> 01:07:54,110
We're going to find somebody
to replace Craig who's smarter,

1056
01:07:54,195 --> 01:07:57,572
and in six months
to a year, we're home. OK?

1057
01:07:57,656 --> 01:07:59,949
- You think?
- This time I just say to you,

1058
01:08:00,034 --> 01:08:02,619
"Embrace it. People love Japan. "

1059
01:08:03,788 --> 01:08:05,747
- Want some?
- No!

1060
01:08:05,831 --> 01:08:08,374
- What? No?
- No. No. OK.

1061
01:08:18,677 --> 01:08:22,430
The truth is, I probably
looked like the Joker from Batman.

1062
01:08:22,515 --> 01:08:25,016
But I felt bad. These poor, sad people.

1063
01:08:25,101 --> 01:08:28,103
Anyway, I'm the first guy
to insult a bereavement group

1064
01:08:28,187 --> 01:08:29,312
and still get the girl.

1065
01:08:32,858 --> 01:08:34,776
That's Yankee ingenuity!

1066
01:08:35,194 --> 01:08:39,823
Please, Charlie, show us that
facial paralysis smile one more time.

1067
01:08:47,998 --> 01:08:50,291
All right, do your thing, superstar.

1068
01:08:50,376 --> 01:08:51,835
Thank you.

1069
01:08:54,046 --> 01:08:56,381
The American sports market
is a minefield,

1070
01:08:56,465 --> 01:08:58,007
and what I'd like to do today

1071
01:08:58,092 --> 01:09:03,012
is draw a map
through that minefield so that...

1072
01:09:08,394 --> 01:09:10,979
OK, Dan. Let's get going.

1073
01:09:11,063 --> 01:09:13,731
I accessed the wrong file.

1074
01:09:13,816 --> 01:09:15,733
- Dad!
- Hey, Dad.

1075
01:09:17,570 --> 01:09:19,821
Um... A little technical...

1076
01:09:23,701 --> 01:09:26,911
- I can do it from my notes.
- OK.

1077
01:09:36,964 --> 01:09:40,300
The first market segment is, um...

1078
01:09:42,261 --> 01:09:43,261
Let's go.

1079
01:09:45,264 --> 01:09:50,101
The idea of sports to a kid...

1080
01:09:53,022 --> 01:09:54,939
Dan, what's going on?

1081
01:09:57,318 --> 01:09:59,819
How could you have tanked that
meeting? The way I set you up,

1082
01:09:59,904 --> 01:10:02,447
you could've told them we were hiring
monkeys and they would have bought it!

1083
01:10:03,449 --> 01:10:04,866
That was our dream, Dan!

1084
01:10:04,950 --> 01:10:08,369
That was going to put us in the hall
of fame of sports marketing.

1085
01:10:08,454 --> 01:10:09,454
Go!

1086
01:10:09,538 --> 01:10:12,707
Remember that USFL account we got?
That would've been the one to tank!

1087
01:10:12,791 --> 01:10:15,668
- Will you please shut up?!
- Now you speak!

1088
01:10:15,753 --> 01:10:17,712
- You want a piece of me? Bring it!
- Bring it! Come on!

1089
01:10:17,796 --> 01:10:20,381
All right! Sorry.

1090
01:10:20,466 --> 01:10:22,217
How's this going to work out, snowball?

1091
01:10:22,301 --> 01:10:24,969
I don't know, man tan. You'll be OK.

1092
01:10:25,054 --> 01:10:28,890
You'll tap-dance yourway into a
brand-newjob, still date 35-year-olds.

1093
01:10:28,974 --> 01:10:32,352
You never grew up.
You never had to. You always had me.

1094
01:10:35,105 --> 01:10:36,898
- God!
- It is small enough!

1095
01:10:36,982 --> 01:10:39,150
- Shut up, Charlie!
- Made for a sardine.

1096
01:10:39,235 --> 01:10:42,237
- I'm a big man. This is a little seat.
- Yeah, you're a big ma...

1097
01:10:42,321 --> 01:10:45,573
- Stop trying to change me, Charlie.
- You know I can't do that.

1098
01:10:45,658 --> 01:10:48,034
- Then I'm done.
- Done with taking my advice?

1099
01:10:48,118 --> 01:10:50,787
- Mmm-hmm.
- Late-night rap sessions?

1100
01:10:50,871 --> 01:10:52,705
But not done
with the time-share in Vail.

1101
01:10:52,790 --> 01:10:54,916
No, I'm done with you.

1102
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:56,960
Welcome aboard,
flight nine to New York.

1103
01:10:57,044 --> 01:10:59,170
We got 18 hours
offlight time ahead of us,

1104
01:10:59,255 --> 01:11:02,632
so turn to the person next to you
and get to know them.

1105
01:11:02,716 --> 01:11:04,509
It's going to be a long ride.

1106
01:11:06,845 --> 01:11:08,304
Where you from?

1107
01:11:10,683 --> 01:11:13,101
The whole trip was a bust
from start to finish.

1108
01:11:13,519 --> 01:11:15,061
Amanda, could I call you back?

1109
01:11:15,145 --> 01:11:18,940
I got to pick up Lucky
from the dog hotel. I'll call you.

1110
01:11:20,192 --> 01:11:23,027
Where's my boy? Where's my boy?

1111
01:11:23,112 --> 01:11:27,323
Lucky, come here, boy.
Where's my goo-go!

1112
01:11:27,908 --> 01:11:28,908
Where is he?

1113
01:11:33,289 --> 01:11:36,291
- Where is he?
- We tried to call.

1114
01:11:44,341 --> 01:11:46,676
Hello, Daniel, it's Charlie.

1115
01:11:46,760 --> 01:11:50,471
Thought you'd like to know that after
14 wonderful, fulfilling years together,

1116
01:11:50,556 --> 01:11:53,266
my true best friend, Lucky, has passed.

1117
01:11:53,350 --> 01:11:56,686
Maybe my life isn't as blessed
as you paint it to be.

1118
01:11:56,770 --> 01:11:59,314
I thought you'd like to know
that the funeral is this Tuesday

1119
01:11:59,398 --> 01:12:02,483
followed by a small,
tasteful reception at my house.

1120
01:12:02,568 --> 01:12:04,152
I'm in different as to whether you come.

1121
01:12:04,236 --> 01:12:05,820
Gentlemen, it's Craig,

1122
01:12:05,904 --> 01:12:07,572
and I'm back in New York.

1123
01:12:07,656 --> 01:12:08,948
I know I messed up.

1124
01:12:09,033 --> 01:12:11,451
I take full responsibility
for the mistakes that I made.

1125
01:12:11,535 --> 01:12:14,495
I'm not going to beg,
and I won't call again.

1126
01:12:15,497 --> 01:12:17,415
The truth is that I was a preemie.

1127
01:12:17,499 --> 01:12:21,544
I was several weeks premature, and
there was talk of oxygen deprivation.

1128
01:12:21,628 --> 01:12:23,212
I'm not making excuses,
but the doctor said...

1129
01:12:23,297 --> 01:12:25,381
Idiot.

1130
01:12:38,479 --> 01:12:40,396
Oh...

1131
01:12:40,481 --> 01:12:42,857
You know someone a bunch ofyears,

1132
01:12:42,941 --> 01:12:47,111
and it's easy to forget
that you were fortunate enough

1133
01:12:47,196 --> 01:12:49,739
to have known them for even one day.

1134
01:12:50,115 --> 01:12:54,702
And that was Lucky, to me.
I mean, he was my friend.

1135
01:12:54,787 --> 01:12:58,331
He... Well, even more important,
he was my family.

1136
01:12:58,415 --> 01:13:01,209
And where was I when he was
breathing his last breath?

1137
01:13:01,293 --> 01:13:03,628
In Japan, making a business deal.

1138
01:13:05,464 --> 01:13:08,633
Is there anyone who would like
to say anything about Lucky

1139
01:13:08,717 --> 01:13:11,594
- before we say goodbye?
- I would.

1140
01:13:20,562 --> 01:13:22,397
I've had the great pleasure
of being the other old dog

1141
01:13:22,481 --> 01:13:24,607
in Charlie's life for the past 30 years.

1142
01:13:26,485 --> 01:13:28,694
Like Lucky,

1143
01:13:28,779 --> 01:13:32,156
I feel like a fortunate son of a gun
to have Charlie as a friend.

1144
01:13:37,287 --> 01:13:38,913
You're so cute.

1145
01:13:38,997 --> 01:13:40,331
Here. A nice bowl of cold water.

1146
01:13:40,416 --> 01:13:42,750
- I'm really glad you came, man.
- Me too.

1147
01:13:42,835 --> 01:13:44,127
It's really important to me.

1148
01:13:45,712 --> 01:13:48,089
- I've said some things...
- Please, don't go there.

1149
01:13:48,173 --> 01:13:49,340
- I have to.
- Why?

1150
01:13:49,425 --> 01:13:52,385
You've always had faith in me,
even when I didn't have faith in myself.

1151
01:13:52,469 --> 01:13:55,263
You're not just my best friend,
you're the best kind offriend.

1152
01:13:56,140 --> 01:13:58,349
You're loyal, honorable...

1153
01:13:58,976 --> 01:14:02,728
But? See I knew there was a "but. "
This is gonna sting like a mother. Go.

1154
01:14:02,813 --> 01:14:04,522
Aside from going into business with you,

1155
01:14:04,606 --> 01:14:07,775
I've only made two good decisions
in my entire life.

1156
01:14:07,860 --> 01:14:11,362
Marrying Vicki and taking those kids.

1157
01:14:11,447 --> 01:14:13,906
And those are the two most impulsive
things I've done in my entire life,

1158
01:14:13,991 --> 01:14:16,951
besides the tattoo, which,
God willing, I'll get over one day.

1159
01:14:17,035 --> 01:14:20,788
I feel another moment of Dan Rayburn
impulsivity about to happen.

1160
01:14:20,873 --> 01:14:23,166
Charlie, this is big.
I'm talking about uprooting,

1161
01:14:23,250 --> 01:14:25,918
change of scenery,
the end of the business as we know it.

1162
01:14:26,003 --> 01:14:29,964
Oh, Dan. We'll figure out the business.
We always do.

1163
01:14:30,048 --> 01:14:34,635
- Yeah, but... I have to get them back.
- Nah. Absolutely not.

1164
01:14:36,472 --> 01:14:37,597
We're gonna get 'em back.

1165
01:14:38,557 --> 01:14:40,892
Yeah. Yeah, little man.

1166
01:14:52,696 --> 01:14:56,157
- Out of the way. Dad on a mission.
- You guys aren't gonna regret this.

1167
01:14:56,241 --> 01:14:58,576
I'll do whatever it takes
to get back into your good grace...

1168
01:14:59,578 --> 01:15:01,662
You want to lighten up
on the throttle, Sparky?

1169
01:15:01,747 --> 01:15:05,166
We got a zoo exit coming up here.

1170
01:15:05,250 --> 01:15:06,918
I'm not gonna miss that birthday party.

1171
01:15:07,002 --> 01:15:08,961
It'sjust great to get the three amigos
back together again.

1172
01:15:09,046 --> 01:15:11,130
You're still on probation!

1173
01:15:15,344 --> 01:15:18,137
- No, no. That's not a lock.
- You open?

1174
01:15:18,222 --> 01:15:20,848
Nah. Sorry,
the zoo closes at 3:00 to new visitors.

1175
01:15:20,933 --> 01:15:23,601
But my kids are in there.
They're having a birthday party,

1176
01:15:23,685 --> 01:15:26,020
and I have to be there because I'm Dad.

1177
01:15:26,104 --> 01:15:28,105
Yeah. This is Dan Rayburn, superdad.

1178
01:15:28,190 --> 01:15:30,525
Check on your list. R-A-Y-B-U-R-N.

1179
01:15:30,609 --> 01:15:35,112
Superdad is super late, all right?
Rayburn? You know what?

1180
01:15:35,197 --> 01:15:38,324
You don't even have the same last name
as the birthday kids. Can't do it.

1181
01:15:38,408 --> 01:15:42,119
- How does three big ones sound?
- A little money, huh?

1182
01:15:42,204 --> 01:15:45,873
Don't you ever hand me
three dollars again.

1183
01:15:45,958 --> 01:15:48,000
- Come on. You can let us...
- You already have a kid there.

1184
01:15:48,085 --> 01:15:49,627
- It's fine.
- I can't let you in.

1185
01:15:49,711 --> 01:15:52,505
He's got a heart problem.
He just wants to see his kids.

1186
01:15:52,589 --> 01:15:55,216
- You shall not pass.
- You're great at your job, man!

1187
01:15:56,510 --> 01:15:58,970
Charlie, what are you doing?

1188
01:16:00,305 --> 01:16:01,514
What are you thinking?

1189
01:16:02,099 --> 01:16:05,601
Danny boy, I am going to
get you into that party,

1190
01:16:05,686 --> 01:16:08,646
at great risk
to my perfect legal record.

1191
01:16:09,356 --> 01:16:11,816
- Through here?
- Oh, yeah. Here we go.

1192
01:16:11,900 --> 01:16:14,151
- That's breaking and entering. No, no.
- Bingo!

1193
01:16:14,236 --> 01:16:16,028
- Don't do that.
- Wait. Let me do it.

1194
01:16:16,113 --> 01:16:17,697
- Why?
- I'll take the risk.

1195
01:16:17,781 --> 01:16:19,615
OK. Go ahead.

1196
01:16:21,493 --> 01:16:23,077
Yeah...

1197
01:16:23,161 --> 01:16:24,787
- Come on. Come on.
- I got it.

1198
01:16:26,373 --> 01:16:28,958
I need some help. I need help.

1199
01:16:29,835 --> 01:16:31,419
- OK.
- Go, Craig.

1200
01:16:31,503 --> 01:16:33,588
- Me? OK.
- Yeah, you first.

1201
01:16:33,672 --> 01:16:36,382
What's her name?

1202
01:16:43,640 --> 01:16:45,224
- We made it.
- We did it!

1203
01:16:45,309 --> 01:16:49,770
Yeah! Can't keep Dan Rayburn out.

1204
01:16:50,355 --> 01:16:52,231
Never doubt you, Charlie. Never.

1205
01:16:52,316 --> 01:16:54,734
- We are in the zoo, guys.
- All right, which way?

1206
01:16:54,818 --> 01:16:57,278
A moat. I wonder what lives here.

1207
01:16:57,362 --> 01:16:59,947
We're in the gorilla enclosure.

1208
01:17:00,032 --> 01:17:02,074
- What?
- Stand still.

1209
01:17:02,159 --> 01:17:04,493
Hold still. Don't do it. Don't move.

1210
01:17:04,578 --> 01:17:07,455
- Gorilla. Silverback gorilla.
- Stay where you are.

1211
01:17:07,539 --> 01:17:09,624
Don't look at him in the eyes.
Just look away.

1212
01:17:09,708 --> 01:17:12,710
Lfyou don't see him, he doesn't
see you. Back up to the tunnel.

1213
01:17:12,794 --> 01:17:15,212
You have to be aggressive with
the larger apes. I've read about this.

1214
01:17:15,297 --> 01:17:17,632
- Back up to the tunnel.
- No, no. No retreat.

1215
01:17:17,716 --> 01:17:20,593
- Retreat. No, retreat.
- You retreat, we are dead.

1216
01:17:21,136 --> 01:17:23,638
He senses fear, he attacks.
Be aggressive.

1217
01:17:35,233 --> 01:17:38,653
- Food!
- Don't provoke it! Charlie, no!

1218
01:17:38,737 --> 01:17:40,279
Aah!

1219
01:17:43,659 --> 01:17:46,494
- Oh!
- Charlie!

1220
01:17:46,578 --> 01:17:48,579
Aggression not working.
Maybe we should be submissive.

1221
01:17:49,414 --> 01:17:52,500
- Or run!
- Every man for himself!

1222
01:17:52,584 --> 01:17:53,668
Run! Go!

1223
01:17:56,421 --> 01:17:57,421
Come on, Danny boy.

1224
01:17:58,590 --> 01:17:59,590
Uh-oh.

1225
01:18:14,898 --> 01:18:17,525
We're alive!

1226
01:18:17,609 --> 01:18:20,695
- Penguins!
- Aw...

1227
01:18:20,779 --> 01:18:22,363
- I love penguins.
- Me too.

1228
01:18:26,284 --> 01:18:28,953
- Angry penguins!
- Save yourself!

1229
01:18:29,037 --> 01:18:30,079
Go to your kids!

1230
01:18:31,957 --> 01:18:33,416
Ow! Ow! Ow!

1231
01:18:35,419 --> 01:18:37,461
Charlie! Charlie!

1232
01:18:38,755 --> 01:18:41,757
- I love you, Charlie!
- Ooh!

1233
01:18:52,310 --> 01:18:55,646
Help. Help.
Help. Help. Help.

1234
01:18:56,690 --> 01:18:58,190
Aahh...

1235
01:19:00,152 --> 01:19:02,570
Everybody, it's cake time.

1236
01:19:05,657 --> 01:19:06,657
Oh!

1237
01:19:08,410 --> 01:19:11,078
- Birthday parties. Which way?
- They're on Adventure Island.

1238
01:19:11,163 --> 01:19:13,414
But the tunnel's closed.
There's no way to get there from here.

1239
01:19:13,498 --> 01:19:17,084
No, no. I got to get
to that birthday party. Please.

1240
01:19:19,421 --> 01:19:20,421
OK.

1241
01:19:22,299 --> 01:19:24,091
- What are you doing?
- Some little girl

1242
01:19:24,176 --> 01:19:26,385
wants a superhero
to fly into her birthday party.

1243
01:19:26,470 --> 01:19:29,388
- Mom calls me, I show up.
- Really?

1244
01:19:33,185 --> 01:19:35,269
We're going to sing HappyBirthday.

1245
01:19:36,772 --> 01:19:38,981
- How does this work?
- You go up, you come down.

1246
01:19:39,065 --> 01:19:42,234
- It's not rocket science, chief.
- And it's safe?

1247
01:19:42,319 --> 01:19:45,613
- Aah... Sure.
- Oh.

1248
01:19:47,407 --> 01:19:50,951
Daddy's coming. Yeah!
Which way is the party?

1249
01:19:51,036 --> 01:19:53,120
- Northwest!
- You got it!

1250
01:19:53,205 --> 01:19:55,498
- Go for it!
- Yeah. Yeah!

1251
01:19:58,585 --> 01:20:01,921
Killer penguins.
Killer penguins!

1252
01:20:03,048 --> 01:20:05,090
- Killer penguins!
- Charlie!

1253
01:20:05,842 --> 01:20:08,511
Dan! What's he doing up there?

1254
01:20:08,595 --> 01:20:11,138
Ah, he wanted to be a superhero
for his daughter's birthday.

1255
01:20:11,223 --> 01:20:14,141
- He know what he's doing?
- It's like a ride. Don't worry.

1256
01:20:15,894 --> 01:20:19,396
Go, Danny boy!
I'm the wind beneath your wings!

1257
01:20:19,481 --> 01:20:22,149
There's no stopping Dan Rayburn!

1258
01:20:24,236 --> 01:20:26,529
Did you see a little man?
He's about yea-big.

1259
01:20:26,613 --> 01:20:29,031
He's got reddish hair.
He looks like a Hobbit.

1260
01:20:29,491 --> 01:20:31,992
Just go to your happy place!

1261
01:20:32,077 --> 01:20:37,164
- Just go to a happy place!
- One, two, three!

1262
01:20:37,499 --> 01:20:40,584
I can fly!

1263
01:20:41,211 --> 01:20:43,879
I can fly! Yes!

1264
01:20:47,384 --> 01:20:50,427
Happy birthday, Zach and Emily!

1265
01:20:51,763 --> 01:20:54,640
Look, guys, it's a superhero,
just like you wanted.

1266
01:20:54,724 --> 01:20:56,851
I'm coming, kids!

1267
01:20:57,519 --> 01:21:00,020
- Oh, my gosh! Dan?
- It's Dad!

1268
01:21:00,105 --> 01:21:02,565
- It's me, Fatherman!
- Dad!

1269
01:21:02,649 --> 01:21:04,316
Yeah!

1270
01:21:04,401 --> 01:21:05,401
I knew it.

1271
01:21:05,485 --> 01:21:08,487
That's right, kids.
Believe what you see!

1272
01:21:09,656 --> 01:21:11,282
- Isn't enough fuel.
- Be careful!

1273
01:21:39,978 --> 01:21:43,397
I'm so sorry.
I just wanted to make an impact.

1274
01:21:43,481 --> 01:21:45,065
Mission accomplished.

1275
01:21:45,150 --> 01:21:47,693
I'm not that bad. It doesn't hurt.
I don't need to go to the hospital.

1276
01:21:47,777 --> 01:21:49,820
I just need to go home and sleep it off.

1277
01:21:50,280 --> 01:21:51,906
- You want to go home?
- Yeah.

1278
01:21:51,990 --> 01:21:53,657
You're in Burlington.
You know that, right?

1279
01:21:53,742 --> 01:21:56,869
I know that.
I rented a house a half mile from here.

1280
01:21:58,496 --> 01:22:00,289
You moved here?

1281
01:22:00,373 --> 01:22:03,417
Look, I know
I loused it up for us romantically

1282
01:22:03,501 --> 01:22:05,961
when I chose Japan over you.

1283
01:22:06,504 --> 01:22:10,007
And after what happened in South Beach,
that's pretty much unforgivable.

1284
01:22:10,550 --> 01:22:12,384
But these guys
weren't around in South Beach.

1285
01:22:13,470 --> 01:22:16,680
Good timing or bad timing, I love them.

1286
01:22:17,933 --> 01:22:20,768
I moved here so,
whether they want to visit me or not,

1287
01:22:20,852 --> 01:22:22,519
I could be closer to them.

1288
01:22:23,855 --> 01:22:26,440
I'm not a superhero, kids.
Maybe that's a good thing

1289
01:22:26,524 --> 01:22:29,693
because, you know, superheroes
are always offfighting crime.

1290
01:22:31,196 --> 01:22:33,572
And I just want to be with you guys...

1291
01:22:33,907 --> 01:22:35,491
...forever, if you'll let me.

1292
01:22:40,789 --> 01:22:42,289
Deal.

1293
01:22:42,832 --> 01:22:44,959
You're on my oxygen!

1294
01:22:45,043 --> 01:22:47,211
Aah!

1295
01:23:21,371 --> 01:23:23,580
Long story short,
he gets the kids, he gets his wife.

1296
01:23:23,665 --> 01:23:25,040
And Nishamura calls and says,

1297
01:23:25,125 --> 01:23:27,793
"We want a family man
to represent a family business. "

1298
01:23:27,877 --> 01:23:30,754
Boom, $47 million in fees later,

1299
01:23:30,839 --> 01:23:32,840
here we are on my best friend's boat
going to Aruba.

1300
01:23:32,924 --> 01:23:35,217
That is a true story. I mean, come on.

1301
01:23:35,301 --> 01:23:38,178
Well, it's a good thing
you brought us down here

1302
01:23:38,263 --> 01:23:42,182
because the high seas are a
dangerous mistress for these children.

1303
01:23:42,267 --> 01:23:46,478
Excuse me. What are you doing
to my boat? Oh, the safety squad? Why?

1304
01:23:46,563 --> 01:23:50,315
It's my kid, OK? The fruit of my loins.
And you just relax, OK?

1305
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:52,359
We're going to fix this boat
so it's safe for her.

1306
01:23:52,444 --> 01:23:53,944
Your baby's only three months old!

1307
01:23:54,029 --> 01:23:56,613
Nick!

1308
01:23:56,698 --> 01:23:59,199
This is not a Sizzler!

1309
01:24:00,076 --> 01:24:01,368
All right, so two weeks.

1310
01:24:01,453 --> 01:24:03,704
Keep the office running smooth
until the big guns get back.

1311
01:24:03,788 --> 01:24:06,123
- That'll be my sole scope ofwork.
- Now, Craig,

1312
01:24:06,207 --> 01:24:08,459
no more karaoke. You are cut off.

1313
01:24:08,543 --> 01:24:10,836
Not even in your own house.
You can do it.

1314
01:24:10,920 --> 01:24:15,966
- Go To! We're gonna miss you, Go To.
- Hey, you guys are using my nickname.

1315
01:24:20,555 --> 01:24:22,723
- Oh...
- Nick?

1316
01:24:22,807 --> 01:24:24,892
Listen. Are you good at puzzles?

1317
01:24:24,976 --> 01:24:28,562
Everybody take their
seasickness pills? Come on, guys.

1318
01:24:28,646 --> 01:24:30,230
Wow. Should we tell?

1319
01:24:30,315 --> 01:24:33,400
I think I remember where they go.

1320
01:24:34,069 --> 01:24:35,527
Yeah.

1321
01:24:36,905 --> 01:24:39,907
All right, we got the bags stowed below.
Seasickness pills

1322
01:24:39,991 --> 01:24:42,326
have been distributed.
Let's just get one bon voyage photo,

1323
01:24:42,410 --> 01:24:44,745
and then
we're ready to shove off, folks.

1324
01:24:44,829 --> 01:24:46,997
All right,
everyone get together for a picture.

1325
01:24:47,082 --> 01:24:48,957
Big smiles. Let's look real happy.

1326
01:24:49,042 --> 01:24:51,251
- Today, Craig.
- Got it?

1327
01:24:51,336 --> 01:24:54,088
Maybe not quite so happy.
