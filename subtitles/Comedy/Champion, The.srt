00:00:47,942 --> 00:00:51,252


2
00:02:23,902 --> 00:02:25,938
Ladies and gentlemen,
as you will, of course,...

3
00:02:26,102 --> 00:02:28,093
...The champion makes his
entry into the stadium.

4
00:02:28,262 --> 00:02:31,140
Most of the spectators
have risen.

5
00:02:31,382 --> 00:02:33,020
We welcome with enthusiasm.

6
00:02:33,222 --> 00:02:36,339
There is no doubt,
most popular is the champion...

7
00:02:36,502 --> 00:02:38,094
...In boxing history

8
00:02:38,982 --> 00:02:40,335
They receive.

9
00:02:40,782 --> 00:02:43,740
Indeed, tonight hailed
something more than a man.

10
00:02:44,502 --> 00:02:45,935
Cheer for a story.

11
00:02:46,462 --> 00:02:49,295
A story that could only
occur in the boxing world.

12
00:02:49,542 --> 00:02:53,421
The story of a man who, starting
of the most sordid poverty,...

13
00:02:53,582 --> 00:02:56,255
...Has become
World Champion.

14
00:03:18,262 --> 00:03:19,934
Come, give us the money.

15
00:03:21,342 --> 00:03:22,616
We know you have it.

16
00:03:23,742 --> 00:03:25,653
Come on, man, if it's just paper.

17
00:03:26,942 --> 00:03:28,421
Jerry, watch the cripple.

18
00:03:35,622 --> 00:03:37,817
Jump, jump!

19
00:03:39,782 --> 00:03:40,931
I said jump!

20
00:04:05,702 --> 00:04:08,262
Midge, you okay?

21
00:04:09,262 --> 00:04:10,615
Are you okay?

22
00:04:10,942 --> 00:04:11,852
Yes.

23
00:04:29,982 --> 00:04:30,858
Come on.

24
00:04:32,062 --> 00:04:33,461
By God, Johnny.

25
00:04:33,622 --> 00:04:35,533
What's the difference? We have room to spare.

26
00:04:36,142 --> 00:04:37,541
- Where are you going?
- A Los Angeles.

27
00:04:37,702 --> 00:04:40,091
- We at Kansas.
- Awarded.

28
00:04:56,702 --> 00:04:57,578
Who won?

29
00:05:00,662 --> 00:05:02,459
We have been robbed in a freight car.

30
00:05:04,182 --> 00:05:05,820
It lasts the life of wandering, right?

31
00:05:05,982 --> 00:05:07,051
We are not that.

32
00:05:07,942 --> 00:05:10,297
We expect a good
business in California.

33
00:05:10,502 --> 00:05:11,491
Sure.

34
00:05:12,222 --> 00:05:13,974
It is true, I'm going to teach.

35
00:05:15,182 --> 00:05:16,137
Here it is.

36
00:05:17,262 --> 00:05:18,377
Is my friend.

37
00:05:18,622 --> 00:05:20,294
We have sold one third of the business.

38
00:05:20,542 --> 00:05:21,452
My brother and me.

39
00:05:21,622 --> 00:05:23,692
- Great. Good luck, guys.
- Thank you.

40
00:05:35,542 --> 00:05:37,931
Kansas arrive within one hour.

41
00:05:45,662 --> 00:05:47,380
Is this where boxing tonight?

42
00:05:47,542 --> 00:05:49,817
Yes, I deal with Romero,
a pretty good.

43
00:05:50,742 --> 00:05:53,415
What has luck and thanks for everything.

44
00:05:53,582 --> 00:05:54,981
Thank you and another.

45
00:05:56,542 --> 00:05:59,852
You could sell out to eat
drinks during the battle.

46
00:06:00,102 --> 00:06:02,821
Sell ​​anything.
Thanks for the idea.

47
00:06:05,582 --> 00:06:06,981
For here, ma'am.

48
00:06:18,102 --> 00:06:19,421
Are you kidding?

49
00:06:19,862 --> 00:06:21,375
Why I will give you work?

50
00:06:22,702 --> 00:06:24,374
My boys have been here for years.

51
00:06:25,062 --> 00:06:26,734
There is no work for strangers.

52
00:06:27,222 --> 00:06:30,692
- Just arrived and already believe...
- Street, not excited.

53
00:06:32,342 --> 00:06:33,570
Care, crippled.

54
00:06:35,142 --> 00:06:36,621
Who do you call cripple?

55
00:06:46,982 --> 00:06:48,461
Not tonight, Charlie.

56
00:06:48,782 --> 00:06:51,171
What do you mean?
This night has to go.

57
00:06:51,502 --> 00:06:54,574
It is an evening short and not
I want to stop the fight.

58
00:06:56,262 --> 00:06:59,891
Sorry, but that court
open only to blow it Silly.

59
00:07:00,262 --> 00:07:01,411
Do not overdo it, man.

60
00:07:01,662 --> 00:07:03,493
It's nothing, a mere scratch.

61
00:07:03,702 --> 00:07:06,421
It's more than a scratch.
Suppose you lost your eye.

62
00:07:06,702 --> 00:07:09,853
I will not play me the
kind or for you or anyone.

63
00:07:12,702 --> 00:07:13,691
Let's see, what do you want?

64
00:07:13,862 --> 00:07:17,138
What do I want? This guy just
six loading cases of beer.

65
00:07:17,302 --> 00:07:19,736
I have many problems, not
bother me. That paid.

66
00:07:19,902 --> 00:07:22,257
- We have no money.
- Let them go to jail.

67
00:07:22,422 --> 00:07:23,901
What prison?

68
00:07:24,062 --> 00:07:26,815
We have only come to ask for work.
Wait a minute.

69
00:07:30,062 --> 00:07:31,381
You are strong, right?

70
00:07:32,382 --> 00:07:34,942
Do you know how much you weigh?
Why?

71
00:07:35,702 --> 00:07:38,091
So on top, about 80 kilos.

72
00:07:38,582 --> 00:07:41,460
Do you want to jump rope
and above earn 35 bucks?

73
00:07:41,742 --> 00:07:42,492
How?

74
00:07:42,702 --> 00:07:46,615
Fighting to 4 rounds with Silly
Mendoza, treat you with care.

75
00:07:47,062 --> 00:07:50,134
Just follow him.
Come on, you say?

76
00:07:51,222 --> 00:07:52,132
Okay.

77
00:07:53,622 --> 00:07:55,613
Bring the dressing room and give him clothes.

78
00:07:58,782 --> 00:08:02,218
Are you crazy? You do not know boxing.
You start beating ears.

79
00:08:02,382 --> 00:08:05,021
Hey, me 35 bucks
let your head off.

80
00:08:42,102 --> 00:08:44,093
Not fight. You can with it.

81
00:08:48,262 --> 00:08:49,251
Open your mouth.

82
00:08:52,662 --> 00:08:54,414
Have you walked by a ring?

83
00:09:30,742 --> 00:09:31,857
One

84
00:09:33,142 --> 00:09:35,610
Two.
I'm going to cough.

85
00:09:35,782 --> 00:09:36,931
Three.

86
00:09:38,462 --> 00:09:40,692
- Four.
- I'm going to the theater.

87
00:09:41,262 --> 00:09:42,490
Five.

88
00:10:19,622 --> 00:10:20,452
Hello.

89
00:10:32,502 --> 00:10:33,537
How are you?

90
00:10:33,782 --> 00:10:34,851
I think I can eat.

91
00:10:35,102 --> 00:10:36,421
When we paid.

92
00:10:38,222 --> 00:10:41,692
Hey, what a job is this.

93
00:10:44,302 --> 00:10:46,577
- Go show.
- Kelly,...

94
00:10:47,342 --> 00:10:48,980
...I want a word with you.

95
00:10:49,142 --> 00:10:51,781
My name is Tommy Haley,
may sound like the name.

96
00:10:52,262 --> 00:10:54,173
I've seen boxing, to call something.

97
00:10:54,342 --> 00:10:57,095
What he did not know write
a book, but you have guts.

98
00:10:57,342 --> 00:11:00,459
- If you want to learn, I'll be your manager.
- No, thanks, this is not going.

99
00:11:00,622 --> 00:11:02,658
In this business there are a lot of money.

100
00:11:04,862 --> 00:11:07,012
Just the same, can you do well.

101
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:09,737
But if you change your mind
go to Los Angeles...

102
00:11:09,902 --> 00:11:13,577
...And get me in the gym Bradey.
If, Los Angeles, gym Bradey.

103
00:11:13,742 --> 00:11:14,572
Okay.

104
00:11:20,102 --> 00:11:20,898
Hello.

105
00:11:22,622 --> 00:11:24,055
Do you give me my money?

106
00:11:24,822 --> 00:11:27,290
As no. Here you go.

107
00:11:28,542 --> 00:11:31,659
$ 10. What about the rest?
And my 35 bucks?

108
00:11:31,942 --> 00:11:32,977
That's your thing.

109
00:11:33,342 --> 00:11:34,741
$ 10 for your assistant,...

110
00:11:34,982 --> 00:11:37,018
...$ 5 for
service costume...

111
00:11:37,182 --> 00:11:40,618
...And $ 10 for your manager.
- I have no manager.

112
00:11:40,782 --> 00:11:43,854
In this club the manager
I am the unknown.

113
00:11:44,102 --> 00:11:46,297
- And now, over here.
- Will...

114
00:11:50,782 --> 00:11:51,737
Vale.

115
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:27,580
Thank you, and hopefully can pay
one day with the same currency.

116
00:12:39,662 --> 00:12:41,095
HELP NEEDED

117
00:12:41,262 --> 00:12:43,457
- The business should be scared.
- Yes.

118
00:12:54,142 --> 00:12:56,053
You do not need this.

119
00:12:57,022 --> 00:12:58,535
Are you looking for work?

120
00:12:58,702 --> 00:13:00,613
We hope to do anything.

121
00:13:02,062 --> 00:13:04,974
Although certain to be
something better than this dump.

122
00:13:07,902 --> 00:13:10,097
Connie, what if we left
back to Las Vegas?

123
00:13:10,262 --> 00:13:12,696
Make up another story because I
seems that the girl...

124
00:13:12,862 --> 00:13:14,853
...Do not swallow it.

125
00:13:15,782 --> 00:13:17,181
Let's see, what do you want?

126
00:13:18,982 --> 00:13:22,258
A little more respect
owners, if you do not mind.

127
00:13:23,982 --> 00:13:25,813
- What about Bud?
- Bud?

128
00:13:25,982 --> 00:13:27,813
Yes, where is our esteemed partner?

129
00:13:28,942 --> 00:13:30,580
Lew. Lew.

130
00:13:34,942 --> 00:13:38,571
The cook. What a great establishment.

131
00:13:38,942 --> 00:13:41,456
Cook, why not
prepare a special dish...

132
00:13:41,622 --> 00:13:42,975
...For your new boss?

133
00:13:43,302 --> 00:13:45,657
Less kidding, this place is not for sale.

134
00:13:46,302 --> 00:13:48,213
- What did you say?
- What you have heard.

135
00:13:51,782 --> 00:13:54,342
Hey, my brother and I bought...

136
00:13:54,502 --> 00:13:56,697
...A month ago that part of
Bud Taylor, you know?

137
00:13:57,702 --> 00:13:59,852
I see clear.

138
00:14:00,502 --> 00:14:03,619
And that last month, right?
That's it.

139
00:14:03,782 --> 00:14:06,012
Just last month that dismissed him.

140
00:14:06,702 --> 00:14:08,977
That guy is even more thief
than I thought.

141
00:14:13,502 --> 00:14:15,254
Who owns the site?

142
00:14:16,382 --> 00:14:17,258
His.

143
00:14:18,182 --> 00:14:22,573
Stay. Housing, food and
$ 100 per month for both.

144
00:14:23,142 --> 00:14:25,098
You sleep in the back room.

145
00:14:28,182 --> 00:14:29,820
And watch out for my daughter.

146
00:14:30,022 --> 00:14:31,171
It is still a baby.

147
00:14:53,862 --> 00:14:56,251
You better scrub dishes
we've ever had.

148
00:14:56,422 --> 00:14:57,252
Thank you.

149
00:14:57,462 --> 00:14:59,737
My mother taught me little one.

150
00:15:01,702 --> 00:15:05,820
Emma, ​​I'm going up to take a nap.

151
00:15:06,702 --> 00:15:08,533
Take care to make it all clean.

152
00:15:08,702 --> 00:15:09,452
Yes, Lew.

153
00:15:11,422 --> 00:15:13,811
And do not dawdle,
much to do.

154
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:18,736
I do not entertain.

155
00:15:19,062 --> 00:15:21,371
Do not take this wrong, you
so many things on my mind.

156
00:15:22,302 --> 00:15:23,701
I do not bother me.

157
00:15:27,582 --> 00:15:28,697
Thank you, sir.

158
00:15:54,542 --> 00:15:56,100
Lew wants to clear this.

159
00:15:56,822 --> 00:15:57,811
Sure.

160
00:16:09,822 --> 00:16:12,052
So, no. Are not you
taught to sweep?

161
00:16:14,062 --> 00:16:15,290
Teach you.

162
00:16:15,702 --> 00:16:18,341
A big man as a
sweeping cathedral and do not know.

163
00:16:18,502 --> 00:16:20,060
You have to do with decision.

164
00:16:21,182 --> 00:16:22,501
You mean like this?

165
00:16:23,582 --> 00:16:24,412
Fresco.

166
00:16:25,102 --> 00:16:26,501
You do it very well.

167
00:16:33,502 --> 00:16:34,696
You're a cool.

168
00:16:35,062 --> 00:16:36,097
Come here.

169
00:16:36,942 --> 00:16:38,295
I do not want.

170
00:16:38,462 --> 00:16:39,292
Vale.

171
00:16:40,702 --> 00:16:42,101
In this way.

172
00:16:50,622 --> 00:16:51,418
Well?

173
00:16:52,142 --> 00:16:53,894
I wanted to talk to you.

174
00:16:58,182 --> 00:17:00,059
What can you do here?

175
00:17:00,262 --> 00:17:01,251
So many things.

176
00:17:01,422 --> 00:17:04,175
There are many who consider a
lucky to have so close to the beach.

177
00:17:04,502 --> 00:17:05,696
And they're right.

178
00:17:06,862 --> 00:17:07,977
What do you think?

179
00:17:08,182 --> 00:17:09,820
We will go after work, okay?

180
00:17:13,422 --> 00:17:14,855
I'll teach you to swim like a fish.

181
00:17:16,462 --> 00:17:18,657
Come on, answer, what do you think?

182
00:17:20,942 --> 00:17:21,818
Can.

183
00:17:40,062 --> 00:17:41,461
I was afraid you would not come.

184
00:17:41,622 --> 00:17:43,180
Lew has taken is to fall asleep.

185
00:17:51,502 --> 00:17:54,972
Well, we hit the water?

186
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:28,978
Do not you bring towel?
Dry off with mine.

187
00:18:29,142 --> 00:18:30,541
No, I do not need.

188
00:18:31,702 --> 00:18:33,533
Please go to catch a cold.

189
00:18:34,222 --> 00:18:36,053
Well, but before you dry up to you.

190
00:18:48,062 --> 00:18:49,131
You're just like...

191
00:18:51,502 --> 00:18:52,855
Like all.
No.

192
00:18:53,502 --> 00:18:54,571
I am special.

193
00:18:54,822 --> 00:18:56,619
Slightly stupid.

194
00:19:03,782 --> 00:19:04,612
It's funny.

195
00:19:05,582 --> 00:19:06,298
What?

196
00:19:06,942 --> 00:19:08,739
At first I liked you.

197
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:10,501
He did not smile ever.

198
00:19:10,862 --> 00:19:13,854
And I mean really smile.
With sincerity.

199
00:19:15,942 --> 00:19:17,933
To really smile
have to be happy.

200
00:19:18,262 --> 00:19:19,456
Are not you happy?

201
00:19:20,102 --> 00:19:24,732
Well, now I am.

202
00:19:27,862 --> 00:19:29,295
Then he smiles.

203
00:19:34,862 --> 00:19:35,692
Midge.

204
00:19:36,382 --> 00:19:37,701
Why are not you happy?

205
00:19:38,462 --> 00:19:42,011
Happy? Poverty is
odds with happiness.

206
00:19:43,222 --> 00:19:44,894
And I've been poor all my life.

207
00:19:45,702 --> 00:19:46,737
Very poor.

208
00:19:48,342 --> 00:19:50,060
You know what it means to be poor?

209
00:19:50,662 --> 00:19:52,414
Does having cold, starving?

210
00:19:52,582 --> 00:19:54,493
No, do not know.

211
00:19:55,342 --> 00:19:59,574
When he was four years
My father left home.

212
00:19:59,782 --> 00:20:02,296
My mother could not keep
Connie and me, so...

213
00:20:02,462 --> 00:20:05,215
...Sent me to an orphanage
until I was old enough to work.

214
00:20:07,102 --> 00:20:09,696
He dreamed of being rich one day.

215
00:20:09,862 --> 00:20:13,457
Hire detectives
to seek my father.

216
00:20:14,062 --> 00:20:16,371
And then break his head.

217
00:20:17,302 --> 00:20:18,974
Nonsense kids.

218
00:20:19,262 --> 00:20:20,661
Our lives are parallel.

219
00:20:20,822 --> 00:20:23,495
Also my mother was
home when I was little.

220
00:20:23,822 --> 00:20:27,656
Before he hated, but now I
I understand certain things.

221
00:20:28,902 --> 00:20:32,895
I do not hate my father. Can
to do well. This life...

222
00:20:34,022 --> 00:20:34,932
What? More.

223
00:20:36,862 --> 00:20:41,014
For this reason a man
struggle against man.

224
00:20:41,382 --> 00:20:43,850
In this life, if you have
money, you're nobody.

225
00:20:44,022 --> 00:20:45,501
It's not so bad. Not always.

226
00:20:45,662 --> 00:20:46,651
You do not know...

227
00:20:48,902 --> 00:20:50,301
...But I will very far.

228
00:20:51,142 --> 00:20:54,214
I earn money and look after my old one.

229
00:20:54,902 --> 00:20:57,097
I will not be a nobody
until I die.

230
00:20:58,342 --> 00:21:00,412
People will call me sir.

231
00:21:01,342 --> 00:21:03,298
I will be an important character.

232
00:21:06,062 --> 00:21:06,892
Will be.

233
00:21:10,182 --> 00:21:11,251
It's late.

234
00:21:25,182 --> 00:21:26,615
Really, it's late.

235
00:21:27,902 --> 00:21:28,937
Well.

236
00:21:42,262 --> 00:21:43,820
You know what time is it?

237
00:21:44,302 --> 00:21:45,257
Where were you?

238
00:21:46,782 --> 00:21:47,532
On the beach.

239
00:21:47,862 --> 00:21:48,931
Alone?

240
00:21:50,022 --> 00:21:52,536
Hey, you want to fire those guys?

241
00:21:53,382 --> 00:21:56,055
Stay away from them. None of them.

242
00:21:56,902 --> 00:21:59,894
Provided by hiding.
You're just like your mother.

243
00:22:13,542 --> 00:22:15,612
A number 6 with black bread, no mustard.

244
00:22:28,262 --> 00:22:29,331
Honey.

245
00:22:33,382 --> 00:22:34,212
Midge.

246
00:22:35,502 --> 00:22:37,379
I am a traitor.

247
00:22:41,582 --> 00:22:42,981
When will we tell?

248
00:22:43,142 --> 00:22:44,291
Tell him what?

249
00:22:44,462 --> 00:22:46,214
What we're getting married soon.

250
00:22:51,142 --> 00:22:52,097
We got married, right?

251
00:22:55,462 --> 00:22:56,417
No?

252
00:22:56,622 --> 00:22:57,691
No, never.

253
00:22:58,502 --> 00:22:59,855
I would not be possible.

254
00:23:01,222 --> 00:23:03,656
I have not a penny, nothing.

255
00:23:03,942 --> 00:23:05,614
It would be very bad for both.

256
00:23:06,142 --> 00:23:08,098
Was it bad?
Sure.

257
00:23:11,462 --> 00:23:12,372
Honey,...

258
00:23:14,342 --> 00:23:16,333
...Is not the time.

259
00:23:16,822 --> 00:23:18,380
We are not prepared.

260
00:23:20,422 --> 00:23:22,413
Why can not
Business as usual?

261
00:23:23,942 --> 00:23:25,614
You know how I feel about you.

262
00:23:50,582 --> 00:23:51,651
You're a disgrace.

263
00:23:52,982 --> 00:23:53,937
And you...

264
00:23:54,102 --> 00:23:56,332
No, Lew, we're getting married.

265
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:58,091
Of course you do.

266
00:23:59,862 --> 00:24:01,215
Of course not.

267
00:24:01,382 --> 00:24:04,340
I know what you think, do not try.

268
00:24:05,102 --> 00:24:08,697
The law is on my side,
did not get far.

269
00:24:14,182 --> 00:24:17,379
By the authority given to me
the state of California.

270
00:24:20,662 --> 00:24:23,654
Thank you very much and good luck to them.

271
00:24:23,822 --> 00:24:25,301
Good night.
Thank you.

272
00:24:27,422 --> 00:24:29,174
Midge, I did not want it that way.

273
00:24:29,582 --> 00:24:32,892
Midge has started badly but it will be good.

274
00:24:33,062 --> 00:24:35,530
I promise, will make you happy.

275
00:24:37,342 --> 00:24:39,697
I'm going, now there is nothing to prevent it.

276
00:24:39,862 --> 00:24:43,218
Is the same. This had to end like this.

277
00:24:43,742 --> 00:24:45,061
I have done my duty.

278
00:24:45,702 --> 00:24:47,693
Do what you want.

279
00:24:48,902 --> 00:24:50,017
Come on, Connie.

280
00:24:54,702 --> 00:24:56,340
Emma, ​​...
What are you waiting?

281
00:25:01,142 --> 00:25:02,734
Midge. Midge!

282
00:25:03,662 --> 00:25:04,651
Wait a minute.

283
00:25:06,462 --> 00:25:08,134
You married, do not leave.
Marry?

284
00:25:08,302 --> 00:25:10,258
Is that what you call it marriage? It's a trap.

285
00:25:10,422 --> 00:25:11,537
The plotted together.

286
00:25:11,702 --> 00:25:13,658
Midge...
Hush, do not give me more advice.

287
00:25:13,862 --> 00:25:14,738
I have had enough.

288
00:25:15,102 --> 00:25:16,854
If both want, stay with it.

289
00:25:17,022 --> 00:25:18,501
But I'm out of here.

290
00:25:19,582 --> 00:25:22,858
- Are you coming or not?
- As you wish, Midge.

291
00:25:32,942 --> 00:25:36,218
EMPLOYMENT OFFICE

292
00:25:42,702 --> 00:25:47,093
GYM BRADEY

293
00:26:39,582 --> 00:26:41,812
- Is Johnny Haley?
- Johnny Haley?

294
00:26:41,982 --> 00:26:44,177
You mean Tommy Haley.
Yes.

295
00:26:44,342 --> 00:26:47,414
Sure it is. You must go around.
Thank you.

296
00:26:53,342 --> 00:26:54,821
Hello, Mr. Haley.

297
00:26:56,222 --> 00:26:58,975
Why, it's Kansas City, how are you?

298
00:26:59,542 --> 00:27:01,339
And that eye?
Pulling.

299
00:27:01,542 --> 00:27:03,578
I'm glad, you see more with two eyes.

300
00:27:03,742 --> 00:27:05,653
He told me to find him, do you remember?

301
00:27:05,822 --> 00:27:07,733
Yes, I think, but I have retired.

302
00:27:07,902 --> 00:27:09,540
No undefeated, but retired.

303
00:27:09,742 --> 00:27:12,620
Do you allow some advice? Do the same.

304
00:27:12,782 --> 00:27:15,580
You volunteered to be my manager
and told me to find him.

305
00:27:15,742 --> 00:27:18,097
That was then, now is now.
Everything changes.

306
00:27:18,262 --> 00:27:19,581
I have retired from boxing.

307
00:27:19,742 --> 00:27:20,970
It sucks, really.

308
00:27:21,902 --> 00:27:24,575
Take a deep breath in here sucks.

309
00:27:24,742 --> 00:27:27,302
And no sweat, this is not good.

310
00:27:28,102 --> 00:27:30,013
Who are you?
His brother.

311
00:27:30,222 --> 00:27:33,259
You look like a boy hustler, no
want to be devoted to boxing.

312
00:27:33,822 --> 00:27:35,175
That's their problem.

313
00:27:36,222 --> 00:27:37,416
Go back home.

314
00:27:38,742 --> 00:27:40,061
What I go to my house?

315
00:27:40,302 --> 00:27:42,293
Do not need you. It is the sole manager.

316
00:27:42,462 --> 00:27:45,454
I'll find another, I see.
What about you?

317
00:27:46,022 --> 00:27:48,013
Do you know the amount
of hits you get...

318
00:27:48,182 --> 00:27:49,854
...In the stomach for a fight?

319
00:27:50,382 --> 00:27:54,057
The human body has not been done
to fight in a ring, Greem.

320
00:27:54,542 --> 00:27:57,136
If you hit a man
followed hard on the head,...

321
00:27:57,422 --> 00:27:58,616
...Even once...

322
00:27:58,942 --> 00:28:01,615
...You can damage your brain
and even kill him.

323
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:03,257
And for what?

324
00:28:03,702 --> 00:28:05,135
Why fill a room?

325
00:28:05,542 --> 00:28:08,102
Why fill the bag to a stranger?

326
00:28:08,262 --> 00:28:11,220
How do you demonstrate that?
Is it a way of living?

327
00:28:11,942 --> 00:28:13,614
Forget it, kid.

328
00:28:14,262 --> 00:28:17,095
- Hi, Tommy.
- Hello, Rubio.

329
00:28:18,862 --> 00:28:22,218
It is the only sport in which
two types paid to do something,...

330
00:28:22,382 --> 00:28:25,738
...That if they were free and drunk,
would be arrested for it.

331
00:28:26,862 --> 00:28:29,934
If you have that opinion,
Why keep coming here?

332
00:28:30,262 --> 00:28:32,139
Good, some are given by the bottle,...

333
00:28:32,302 --> 00:28:35,021
I enjoy watching...
the boys in action.

334
00:28:36,182 --> 00:28:39,140
Here, give it back when working.

335
00:28:40,422 --> 00:28:42,936
Keep it, find work...

336
00:28:43,182 --> 00:28:46,219
...A cook, waiter
or digging ditches.

337
00:28:46,382 --> 00:28:48,259
Honest work, clean and healthy.

338
00:28:48,422 --> 00:28:49,377
And I forraré.

339
00:28:50,902 --> 00:28:52,893
You told me in
Boxing had pasta.

340
00:28:53,062 --> 00:28:55,417
Be my manager and I will win for both.

341
00:28:56,542 --> 00:28:58,658
- Yes?
- I bet you want.

342
00:29:01,462 --> 00:29:05,137
Okay, I will.
Well.

343
00:29:05,302 --> 00:29:06,701
But attention to this.

344
00:29:07,342 --> 00:29:10,140
Just be your manager as
think you can go.

345
00:29:10,422 --> 00:29:13,255
I'm not interested in fighting
club or $ 50 bags.

346
00:29:13,422 --> 00:29:14,696
And work hard.

347
00:29:14,862 --> 00:29:17,501
You will work hard
rather than in your entire life.

348
00:29:42,702 --> 00:29:45,375
<i> Until the bones are
creak with the effort...</ i>

349
00:29:45,542 --> 00:29:48,340
...And until you learn to
to break a man.

350
00:30:00,942 --> 00:30:04,651
<i> teach you all the tricks
dirty boxing. And there are many. </ I>

351
00:30:58,302 --> 00:31:00,736
I'm going to throw <i> the ring...</ i>

352
00:31:01,342 --> 00:31:02,775
<i>...and see what you're capable of. </ i>

353
00:31:18,902 --> 00:31:21,974
Four, five, six,...

354
00:31:22,422 --> 00:31:25,732
...Seven, eight, nine,...

355
00:31:25,982 --> 00:31:26,778
...Ten.

356
00:31:35,782 --> 00:31:38,979
Well, what do you say now?

357
00:31:39,302 --> 00:31:42,612
You progress, if you correct
I see some defects.

358
00:31:42,822 --> 00:31:43,971
Quite a few flaws.

359
00:31:44,382 --> 00:31:46,532
I hope tomorrow
the gym at nine.

360
00:31:46,702 --> 00:31:49,170
- Go and have a lot to do.
- OK, boss.

361
00:31:50,462 --> 00:31:54,740
This march. It costs less
get a tooth that a washing machine.

362
00:31:54,942 --> 00:31:56,170
But I've done well.

363
00:31:56,662 --> 00:31:59,699
I know from the public.
Cheered all my shots.

364
00:32:00,022 --> 00:32:02,058
Yes, you've been good.

365
00:32:02,782 --> 00:32:04,215
You know what I thought?

366
00:32:04,782 --> 00:32:07,774
Now that you've shown
your worth to yourself...

367
00:32:08,342 --> 00:32:10,139
...I think you should quit.

368
00:32:11,982 --> 00:32:14,052
You are crazy.
I think not.

369
00:32:14,342 --> 00:32:15,616
So what's wrong?

370
00:32:16,262 --> 00:32:18,139
Nothing, leave it.

371
00:32:18,302 --> 00:32:20,736
No, you have hidden something, you know.

372
00:32:21,462 --> 00:32:22,781
And I love you.

373
00:32:23,302 --> 00:32:24,735
But you are not the same, Midge.

374
00:32:24,902 --> 00:32:26,699
It was as if you wanted to kill that guy.

375
00:32:26,862 --> 00:32:29,137
I would have killed him if
I had been allowed.

376
00:32:29,502 --> 00:32:30,696
Is that bad?

377
00:32:31,942 --> 00:32:34,502
I do not know, I really do not know.

378
00:32:35,622 --> 00:32:38,420
But I kept thinking that
was not only the boy's ring.

379
00:32:38,662 --> 00:32:40,653
You were hitting a lot of people.

380
00:32:40,862 --> 00:32:43,615
In other types. For the
They hurt you.

381
00:32:44,182 --> 00:32:47,936
I have not quite clear,
but I think that's dangerous.

382
00:32:49,022 --> 00:32:51,855
Especially being a boxer.

383
00:32:52,022 --> 00:32:54,741
And if you must know,
I do not like boxing.

384
00:32:54,902 --> 00:32:57,621
You sound like a kid. Nonsense.

385
00:32:57,782 --> 00:33:00,979
Hey, I won my first match.

386
00:33:01,822 --> 00:33:06,100
Have you heard people?
For the first time I have applauded.

387
00:33:06,302 --> 00:33:08,020
Have not you heard? Are you deaf?

388
00:33:11,222 --> 00:33:14,578
Connie, wake up, Connie.

389
00:33:14,942 --> 00:33:17,979
Smell the coffee, smell the steaks.

390
00:33:18,502 --> 00:33:19,935
Because you learn.

391
00:33:20,102 --> 00:33:23,538
Just as well. I have the foot
in the first step.

392
00:33:23,702 --> 00:33:26,170
No more auto-stop,
Now we drive.

393
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:41,531
This program is hard but you compensate.

394
00:33:41,702 --> 00:33:43,533
In Portland will fight
Harvey Baker,...

395
00:33:43,702 --> 00:33:46,580
...a strongman with <i>
jaw butter. </ i>

396
00:33:48,022 --> 00:33:50,172
Tacoma awaits <i> Louis Shenker ,...</ i>

397
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:54,013
<i>...nice guy, but weak of stomach. </ i>

398
00:33:56,262 --> 00:33:58,730
<i> After eastwards. Salt Lake ,...</ i>

399
00:34:00,102 --> 00:34:02,457
<i>...Denver, Omaha ,...</ i>

<i>...Tulsa, Dallas ,...</ i>

<i>...St. Louis, Kansas City. </ i>

402
00:34:21,982 --> 00:34:23,700
What? What fly has stung?

403
00:34:23,862 --> 00:34:25,659
These people are going to riot.

404
00:34:25,822 --> 00:34:27,813
You owe me $ 25.

405
00:34:28,542 --> 00:34:32,012
What do I owe you $ 25?
Yes.

406
00:34:33,462 --> 00:34:36,499
I owe you $ 25. Sure, Midge.

407
00:34:36,702 --> 00:34:38,021
Here, here they are.

408
00:34:56,422 --> 00:34:58,174
You'll have to get by <i>...</ i>

409
00:34:58,542 --> 00:35:00,897
<i>...and you do what

411
00:35:02,742 --> 00:35:04,300
Mom, what do you think?

412
00:35:05,422 --> 00:35:07,811
It's beautiful.
Yes it is.

413
00:35:17,462 --> 00:35:19,817
Ever beaten
you, of course.

414
00:35:19,982 --> 00:35:22,416
<i> be you who has
to rise from the canvas. </ i>

415
00:35:23,182 --> 00:35:25,821
But in a couple of years
will be more famous than anyone.

416
00:35:43,542 --> 00:35:45,453
I received a telegram
in your sleep.

417
00:35:45,782 --> 00:35:49,252
If we win it, you'll face
New York to Johnny Dunne.

418
00:35:49,422 --> 00:35:50,332
If we, of course.

419
00:35:50,502 --> 00:35:51,935
Did you doubt it?

420
00:35:52,102 --> 00:35:55,219
Is the number one fans
consider him the king.

421
00:35:55,502 --> 00:35:56,651
I do not know if you are prepared.

422
00:35:57,822 --> 00:35:59,813
AGAINST KELLY DUNNE
FOR THE NEXT SEPTEMBER

423
00:36:10,742 --> 00:36:14,178
Hey, Tommy, do you know how
costs a tie in this city?

424
00:36:14,622 --> 00:36:17,500
18 bucks. Look at this.

425
00:36:18,702 --> 00:36:22,138
Here, take off that pony
his neck.

426
00:36:23,982 --> 00:36:26,018
I just came from downtown.

427
00:36:26,182 --> 00:36:28,457
They gave me a cigar,
pat on the back...

428
00:36:28,622 --> 00:36:30,021
...And I have sent to hell.

429
00:36:30,862 --> 00:36:32,978
They say you can not beat Dunne.

430
00:36:34,102 --> 00:36:35,774
What I can not win Dunne?

431
00:36:35,942 --> 00:36:37,216
I forbid it.

432
00:36:37,662 --> 00:36:41,291
Dunne takes years to get
the title and make a good box office.

433
00:36:42,062 --> 00:36:44,178
The champion is old and tired.

434
00:36:44,382 --> 00:36:48,739
You lose, Dunne won
and then go for the title.

435
00:36:48,942 --> 00:36:49,772
What?

436
00:36:49,942 --> 00:36:51,773
You'll get a lot of work here.

437
00:36:51,942 --> 00:36:54,502
And after a year you will
opportunity to test yourself against it.

438
00:36:54,822 --> 00:36:55,811
That's the deal.

439
00:36:57,142 --> 00:36:59,781
What is lost? A rigged fight?

440
00:36:59,942 --> 00:37:02,661
You get to choose that or no combat.

441
00:37:02,822 --> 00:37:04,414
Who cares what they want them?

442
00:37:04,902 --> 00:37:08,019
Look, I control everything
are the masters of the business.

443
00:37:08,182 --> 00:37:12,061
- But they are my masters.
- Do not be so sure.

444
00:37:12,942 --> 00:37:15,058
Hey, Midge, I would not say that you do.

445
00:37:15,222 --> 00:37:18,180
If you do, you are in the
blacklisted and will fight on kittens...

446
00:37:18,342 --> 00:37:20,856
...Until the beard
you get to the feet.

447
00:37:21,022 --> 00:37:23,980
No, me do not play these puppets.

448
00:37:25,262 --> 00:37:27,218
It is my great opportunity,
I won me...

449
00:37:27,382 --> 00:37:28,656
...And I can prove it.

450
00:37:28,822 --> 00:37:30,699
What manager are you?
How you get to you?

451
00:37:30,862 --> 00:37:34,775
Care, Midge, do not offend
Haley, earns the same as you.

452
00:37:36,102 --> 00:37:39,253
What is this world sows.

453
00:37:39,782 --> 00:37:42,899
Three years working as a slave,...

454
00:37:43,062 --> 00:37:44,461
...Making muscles.

455
00:37:44,622 --> 00:37:46,294
Living like a monk, machacándote.

456
00:37:46,462 --> 00:37:49,499
And come the pure bellied
say you're a bum.

457
00:37:49,662 --> 00:37:51,573
I can lie and you know it well.

458
00:37:52,462 --> 00:37:54,657
You're the best boxer
've ever had, Midge.

459
00:37:55,462 --> 00:37:56,895
A great fighter.

460
00:37:57,862 --> 00:37:59,375
But if you want to stay here,...

461
00:37:59,542 --> 00:38:01,737
...Close to where the money is,...

462
00:38:01,902 --> 00:38:03,221
...You have to lose.

463
00:38:03,902 --> 00:38:04,937
It depends on you...

464
00:38:06,182 --> 00:38:07,297
...What is your decision?

465
00:38:07,982 --> 00:38:09,017
Losing.

466
00:38:18,662 --> 00:38:19,856
Johnny Dunne.

467
00:38:28,102 --> 00:38:30,900
Do not do any favors
out with that blonde.

468
00:38:31,542 --> 00:38:34,693
What's the difference? It will
to lose any bout.

469
00:38:50,182 --> 00:38:51,171
And for what?

470
00:39:10,782 --> 00:39:13,057
You've come a long way from Kansas City.

471
00:39:13,302 --> 00:39:14,132
Yes.

472
00:39:14,622 --> 00:39:16,977
Relax, your chance will come.

473
00:39:42,302 --> 00:39:43,621
Come, boys, to work.

474
00:39:44,022 --> 00:39:47,412
Johnny, Midge, and
know the rules.

475
00:39:47,582 --> 00:39:49,698
Be advised that no
passeth not a single blow.

476
00:39:49,862 --> 00:39:51,215
I want a fair fight.

477
00:39:51,382 --> 00:39:54,294
Daos hand and start
when the bell rings.

478
00:41:00,822 --> 00:41:02,813
Come, come here.

479
00:41:07,342 --> 00:41:10,778
Phone 78941.
Come on.

480
00:41:12,902 --> 00:41:15,336
Ladies and gentlemen,...

481
00:41:15,822 --> 00:41:19,417
K.O. conqueror.....

482
00:41:23,862 --> 00:41:27,252
Connie, come to find a taxi. We
wait with the engine running.

483
00:41:27,422 --> 00:41:28,901
What is it?

484
00:41:30,622 --> 00:41:32,772
Put this on, you have
no time to shower.

485
00:41:32,942 --> 00:41:33,772
Why not?

486
00:41:33,942 --> 00:41:35,933
- There it is.
- Kelly, you were great.

487
00:41:36,102 --> 00:41:39,412
- Congratulations.
- Look, does not have a scratch.

488
00:41:39,582 --> 00:41:41,379
Where will you cope with the champion?

489
00:41:41,542 --> 00:41:43,373
- When?
- Do you think you can with it?

490
00:41:43,542 --> 00:41:45,533
You're in good shape.

491
00:41:45,702 --> 00:41:47,294
This was a short bout.

492
00:41:51,542 --> 00:41:54,978
Do not go, keep going.

493
00:42:02,182 --> 00:42:03,820
Trust me, come on.

494
00:42:04,102 --> 00:42:05,455
What are you afraid?

495
00:42:06,942 --> 00:42:10,059
I won, that does not change anyone.

496
00:42:10,942 --> 00:42:11,818
You think so?

497
00:42:12,302 --> 00:42:14,338
The way things are now.

498
00:42:50,942 --> 00:42:53,012
It is useless, we must part.

499
00:42:53,182 --> 00:42:55,252
Do as I say, I do not follow me.

500
00:44:29,142 --> 00:44:30,894
Latest news.

501
00:44:31,062 --> 00:44:33,098
Thugs beat up a champion.

502
00:44:33,582 --> 00:44:37,097
Latest news. Some Bullies
they beat a champion.

503
00:44:38,062 --> 00:44:41,259
EXCLUSIVE: THE K.O. KELLY A
DUNNE IN SLOW MOTION

504
00:45:08,342 --> 00:45:10,731
The world of sports
has a new hero.

505
00:45:10,902 --> 00:45:13,052
Everyone talks about Midge Kelly.

506
00:45:13,222 --> 00:45:15,782
The Western boxing machine,
who would not bend...

507
00:45:15,942 --> 00:45:17,580
...A series of anonymous threats.

508
00:45:17,742 --> 00:45:19,698
Nevertheless, he fought and won.

509
00:45:19,862 --> 00:45:22,581
This morning I met
Midge Kelly and I must confess...

510
00:45:22,742 --> 00:45:25,779
...That all my prejudices about
professional boxers...

511
00:45:25,982 --> 00:45:27,973
...Have been destroyed.

512
00:45:28,142 --> 00:45:30,497
<i> is modest, somewhat shy...</ i>

513
00:45:30,662 --> 00:45:33,779
<i>...and very handsome, while
male and neglected. </ i>

514
00:45:33,942 --> 00:45:37,298
<i> Single, no obligation
dear friends. </ i>

515
00:45:38,702 --> 00:45:39,612
This march.

516
00:45:39,782 --> 00:45:42,296
We boarded the train
of luck and it does not stop.

517
00:45:48,462 --> 00:45:51,852
I know that you played a trick.

518
00:45:52,142 --> 00:45:53,973
But it went well, right?

519
00:45:56,382 --> 00:45:57,497
Let me explain.

520
00:45:59,462 --> 00:46:03,660
Come on, Tommy, I did it on purpose.

521
00:46:04,142 --> 00:46:06,098
He was willing to lose the match.

522
00:46:06,582 --> 00:46:08,573
But when I stepped into the ring,
not happened to me.

523
00:46:08,742 --> 00:46:09,652
Leave it.

524
00:46:09,902 --> 00:46:13,133
When you can get up,
we will see how I fix it.

525
00:46:13,302 --> 00:46:16,499
No need them, the newspapers
ask me in front with the champion.

526
00:46:16,662 --> 00:46:17,890
You should read it.

527
00:46:20,382 --> 00:46:21,212
Hello?

528
00:46:23,622 --> 00:46:24,611
Yes.

529
00:46:28,662 --> 00:46:30,300
Why not now?

530
00:46:32,142 --> 00:46:33,131
Vale.

531
00:46:41,102 --> 00:46:42,899
You excuse me, gentlemen?

532
00:46:45,542 --> 00:46:46,497
Pass.

533
00:46:50,222 --> 00:46:51,177
Hello.

534
00:46:52,582 --> 00:46:55,255
Hi, 78941.

535
00:46:58,262 --> 00:46:59,172
¿Martini?

536
00:46:59,942 --> 00:47:00,772
Yes.

537
00:47:03,142 --> 00:47:05,292
¿Onion or olive?
Oils.

538
00:47:10,382 --> 00:47:11,178
Thank you.

539
00:47:11,942 --> 00:47:12,818
Sit down.

540
00:47:13,622 --> 00:47:14,372
Thank you.

541
00:47:17,422 --> 00:47:19,617
They say you fought two battles.

542
00:47:21,262 --> 00:47:22,092
Yes.

543
00:47:23,182 --> 00:47:24,217
And how do you feel?

544
00:47:25,222 --> 00:47:26,052
Well.

545
00:47:26,982 --> 00:47:30,213
Johnny is in the hospital.
So I heard.

546
00:47:30,782 --> 00:47:33,933
They say it's very serious,
can not return to boxing.

547
00:47:34,622 --> 00:47:37,136
Sorry.

548
00:47:40,302 --> 00:47:42,020
Now you are the king of the world.

549
00:47:43,262 --> 00:47:44,058
Yes.

550
00:47:48,662 --> 00:47:49,890
All for the winner.

551
00:47:51,462 --> 00:47:52,531
I guess.

552
00:47:55,182 --> 00:47:57,013
Johnny spent a long time.

553
00:47:57,182 --> 00:48:00,458
Think you can take away a fortune
and stay with me as if...

554
00:48:00,622 --> 00:48:01,452
...A used dress?

555
00:48:01,982 --> 00:48:05,895
78,941 out of here.

556
00:48:11,342 --> 00:48:12,457
Come here, Kelly.

557
00:48:15,262 --> 00:48:16,058
Ven.

558
00:48:25,542 --> 00:48:27,373
You give up too soon.

559
00:48:29,302 --> 00:48:32,294
I am very expensive, very expensive.

560
00:48:32,942 --> 00:48:35,297
I do not want you to think
you buy cheap.

561
00:48:37,662 --> 00:48:39,300
Still hurts, honey?

562
00:48:44,302 --> 00:48:45,337
So is yours.

563
00:48:45,502 --> 00:48:47,379
What do you have? Is the explosion of the press?

564
00:48:47,542 --> 00:48:48,770
A radio report?

565
00:48:48,942 --> 00:48:50,580
A boxer signed?

566
00:48:50,742 --> 00:48:53,495
Those betting on a horse
not run again. I know.

567
00:48:53,662 --> 00:48:55,653
Of good ink. The bill is very high.

568
00:48:55,822 --> 00:48:56,538
How high?

569
00:48:56,702 --> 00:48:58,738
According to my information, more than 130 thousand.

570
00:48:59,182 --> 00:49:00,376
And all settled?

571
00:49:01,502 --> 00:49:03,732
In my experience
Money buys everything.

572
00:49:04,662 --> 00:49:05,811
So pardon.

573
00:49:06,622 --> 00:49:08,214
Jerry, what do we do?

574
00:49:08,422 --> 00:49:10,253
Setting an to get
sad about Johnny?

575
00:49:10,422 --> 00:49:11,775
This is an opportunity.

576
00:49:12,342 --> 00:49:14,094
I do not pay money to strangers.

577
00:49:14,302 --> 00:49:16,497
It also has its manager,
Not married.

578
00:49:16,742 --> 00:49:18,380
You can change your manager.

579
00:49:18,742 --> 00:49:20,380
Not even you might get it.

580
00:49:20,542 --> 00:49:23,500
Loyalty to him is sacred,
too dangerous.

581
00:49:23,982 --> 00:49:27,736
I'm tired of boxing, I should
changing show.

582
00:49:28,702 --> 00:49:30,215
What do you do, bathe in it?

583
00:49:30,502 --> 00:49:32,140
At one time you liked.

584
00:49:36,462 --> 00:49:37,451
I stayed to eat.

585
00:49:37,622 --> 00:49:39,852
Do not wait for your
dear Mrs. Harris.

586
00:49:41,342 --> 00:49:45,381
Jerry, let's be clear, you want
money more than me.

587
00:49:45,622 --> 00:49:49,251
If I succeed, and I think
I will, are you interested?

588
00:49:50,182 --> 00:49:51,331
Yes, I'm interested.

589
00:49:52,022 --> 00:49:54,582
Go ahead, do your work.

590
00:49:54,862 --> 00:49:55,897
I will.

591
00:49:58,742 --> 00:50:00,061
Have not come back?

592
00:50:00,262 --> 00:50:02,981
Not yet, Mr. Kelly,
I'm waiting.

593
00:50:03,142 --> 00:50:04,495
He can not take too long.

594
00:50:04,662 --> 00:50:05,936
Do you know where?

595
00:50:06,262 --> 00:50:07,741
<i> No, Mr. Kelly, do not know. </ i>

596
00:50:08,382 --> 00:50:10,373
Tell him that I called again.

597
00:50:13,542 --> 00:50:16,340
- Got a problem?
- Shut up, ready.

598
00:50:19,902 --> 00:50:23,099
When do I get a fight?
I'm starting to get tired of the gym.

599
00:50:23,742 --> 00:50:24,777
I do not know.

600
00:50:25,342 --> 00:50:27,617
And here I think than ever.

601
00:50:27,782 --> 00:50:30,012
These crazy. Still
without reading the newspapers?

602
00:50:30,222 --> 00:50:32,690
Newspapers do not control boxing.

603
00:50:33,782 --> 00:50:35,898
We should return to the coast.

604
00:50:36,222 --> 00:50:37,974
Settle in Los Angeles.

605
00:50:38,262 --> 00:50:40,457
Get into the head
I do not take orders.

606
00:50:40,742 --> 00:50:42,460
To me no one misses me here.

607
00:50:45,262 --> 00:50:46,377
I'm glad to know.

608
00:50:49,142 --> 00:50:50,416
But where is it?

609
00:50:58,902 --> 00:51:01,621
I see Miss Diamond.
Not, really.

610
00:51:01,782 --> 00:51:03,340
Repeating it takes three days.

611
00:51:03,502 --> 00:51:05,891
- The wait here.
- Hi, Kelly.

612
00:51:06,222 --> 00:51:09,931
If you're not home, where are you?

613
00:51:10,902 --> 00:51:12,858
I do not like people who lie.

614
00:51:13,142 --> 00:51:16,930
Do not be angry, Kelly,
just wanted to be good to you.

615
00:51:17,982 --> 00:51:19,574
I told you I'm very expensive.

616
00:51:20,502 --> 00:51:22,060
I like nice things.

617
00:51:24,222 --> 00:51:25,621
And you can not buy.

618
00:51:25,782 --> 00:51:27,613
Do not have a job in this city.

619
00:51:27,942 --> 00:51:29,534
So why insist?

620
00:51:32,142 --> 00:51:33,495
Do you want to fire me?

621
00:51:33,862 --> 00:51:35,454
I explained the scenario.

622
00:51:35,862 --> 00:51:38,330
I told you to see Harris,
that would solve.

623
00:51:38,622 --> 00:51:40,977
- But you do not receive orders.
- I have a manager.

624
00:51:41,142 --> 00:51:43,576
You also have an appendix
and that's not going to make you rich.

625
00:51:45,782 --> 00:51:48,535
Already a big boy, you have many expenses.

626
00:51:48,782 --> 00:51:51,455
With Harris would have it
Johnny would have.

627
00:51:51,982 --> 00:51:55,054
I do not know the game to Haley,
He picked me up from the street.

628
00:51:56,102 --> 00:51:57,615
Also I owe a lot of money.

629
00:51:57,822 --> 00:52:00,939
Wake up, Harris or
back to the dump.

630
00:52:01,142 --> 00:52:03,451
- And I want sites taxi.
- I can not.

631
00:52:03,622 --> 00:52:06,136
Then take off your license
peddler.

632
00:52:08,622 --> 00:52:12,535
Midge, do it for your sake and for mine.

633
00:52:12,742 --> 00:52:16,178
Promise you will go to see
Harris, just to see him.

634
00:52:16,662 --> 00:52:17,492
No.

635
00:52:18,302 --> 00:52:20,020
It never hurts to discuss things.

636
00:52:20,182 --> 00:52:22,093
Especially when there's money involved.

637
00:52:24,942 --> 00:52:26,978
Look, Midge, do not pretend
convince you of anything.

638
00:52:27,462 --> 00:52:29,293
You need me and I you not.

639
00:52:29,782 --> 00:52:32,250
But with you there is some incentive.

640
00:52:33,222 --> 00:52:34,701
And that interests me.

641
00:52:37,422 --> 00:52:38,855
Beautiful view, right?

642
00:52:40,702 --> 00:52:42,420
The capital of the world.

643
00:52:44,662 --> 00:52:46,254
It will be all yours if you want.

644
00:52:48,942 --> 00:52:50,898
That little thing seems
people from here.

645
00:52:52,702 --> 00:52:55,011
There are only two kinds of
people in the world.

646
00:52:55,182 --> 00:52:56,456
Small and large.

647
00:52:57,342 --> 00:53:00,175
And rarely has occasion
decide for yourself...

648
00:53:00,342 --> 00:53:01,855
...Which one you want to be.

649
00:53:05,342 --> 00:53:06,457
You are ready, Midge.

650
00:53:06,742 --> 00:53:08,334
You're an ordinary boxer.

651
00:53:08,942 --> 00:53:12,014
One day you will have to pay up
the last minute that passes in the ring.

652
00:53:14,182 --> 00:53:15,615
How are you going to end?

653
00:53:20,862 --> 00:53:22,614
Nobody can teach you anything about boxing,...

654
00:53:22,782 --> 00:53:24,852
...Any ex-boxer
will keep you fit.

655
00:53:25,022 --> 00:53:28,935
But if I'm your manager, take care
your money, lay it right.

656
00:53:30,542 --> 00:53:32,612
You will not have to box
when you get your decline.

657
00:53:33,462 --> 00:53:36,818
You left when you want and continue
Lord calling you all your life.

658
00:53:36,982 --> 00:53:37,937
Think about it.

659
00:53:39,262 --> 00:53:40,775
You have to take the decision.

660
00:53:41,582 --> 00:53:43,652
Want to sign the check or not?

661
00:53:53,822 --> 00:53:55,778
Walker says that you
to fight for the title.

662
00:53:56,702 --> 00:53:57,532
It's true.

663
00:53:57,822 --> 00:53:58,732
Yes?

664
00:53:59,302 --> 00:54:00,291
How do you know?

665
00:54:00,462 --> 00:54:02,214
Because I came and conquered, that's all.

666
00:54:02,382 --> 00:54:04,452
I did not want to return to the coast.

667
00:54:05,022 --> 00:54:07,013
Well, hats off.

668
00:54:07,622 --> 00:54:09,533
Not only that what you are going to remove.

669
00:54:10,342 --> 00:54:12,014
I thought you left with much.

670
00:54:12,662 --> 00:54:16,018
For what little you do for
my 25 percent is too much.

671
00:54:16,862 --> 00:54:18,818
Did I hear correctly?

672
00:54:19,022 --> 00:54:20,375
You heard right.

673
00:54:22,542 --> 00:54:24,100
So you go with those.

674
00:54:25,782 --> 00:54:28,899
I've caught them by surprise.
I thought we were...

675
00:54:30,302 --> 00:54:31,860
How much is too much?

676
00:54:33,062 --> 00:54:34,939
I do not know.
Do not you know?

677
00:54:35,862 --> 00:54:38,456
What comes to be that nothing would be much.

678
00:54:39,062 --> 00:54:40,336
We talk about what you owe.

679
00:54:40,502 --> 00:54:42,697
I have, you
more than you expect.

680
00:54:42,862 --> 00:54:43,533
Thank you.

681
00:54:43,702 --> 00:54:45,579
Did you read what it says Walker?

682
00:54:47,142 --> 00:54:48,018
What?

683
00:54:48,182 --> 00:54:51,254
Nothing, we are celebrating.

684
00:54:52,622 --> 00:54:55,853
Midge fight for the title and
has found a new manager.

685
00:54:56,382 --> 00:54:58,850
- A blonde.
- Stop it, Haley.

686
00:54:59,142 --> 00:55:03,135
Well, man, I'm going.

687
00:55:04,742 --> 00:55:07,017
What right had he to expect anything else?

688
00:55:07,742 --> 00:55:11,337
While this mob and I know I am old
to swallow fairy tales.

689
00:55:12,702 --> 00:55:14,294
Do you know what a 'golem'?

690
00:55:16,422 --> 00:55:18,811
I had a feeling
I was creating one.

691
00:55:19,702 --> 00:55:23,615
But it is something that I can.

692
00:55:24,582 --> 00:55:26,857
I'm crazy to see a good
fighter in action.

693
00:55:31,902 --> 00:55:32,971
I've fired.

694
00:55:34,342 --> 00:55:35,491
It was necessary.

695
00:55:36,742 --> 00:55:39,097
Harris had to sign,
was our salvation.

696
00:55:40,462 --> 00:55:42,054
How many years I have left?

697
00:55:42,222 --> 00:55:45,771
That's not an excuse. That man
has been a father to you.

698
00:55:45,982 --> 00:55:48,177
I have fed you brought fame,
you owe it everything.

699
00:55:48,342 --> 00:55:51,493
And has earned me a lot.
Who They hit me or Haley?

700
00:55:52,622 --> 00:55:56,615
- Yuck counsel.
- You leave this office.

701
00:55:57,422 --> 00:56:00,892
It is like the others, only
that this is blood.

702
00:56:03,622 --> 00:56:05,260
Yes, I fired.

703
00:56:09,502 --> 00:56:13,051
Connie, do you think the world
is full of angels?

704
00:56:13,542 --> 00:56:15,453
It's time to wake up.

705
00:56:16,342 --> 00:56:20,620
Listen, you, me and our mother.
That's all that matters, nobody else.

706
00:56:21,062 --> 00:56:24,293
What happened to you? Have you anything
gets in your way?

707
00:56:24,582 --> 00:56:26,971
First Emma, ​​then
Johnny Dunne and now Haley.

708
00:56:27,342 --> 00:56:30,379
You have your own methods
destroy and I do not wish to support.

709
00:56:30,702 --> 00:56:32,294
Who forces you?

710
00:56:34,622 --> 00:56:37,659
Thank you, Midge, me
you put a snap.

711
00:56:38,622 --> 00:56:41,500
Yes, go, stay by yourself.

712
00:56:41,982 --> 00:56:43,938
Find yourself a job, go with Haley.

713
00:56:44,422 --> 00:56:46,219
Do not worry about your brother.

714
00:56:46,422 --> 00:56:49,812
Not that, Midge, is not
I could sleep at night...

715
00:56:49,982 --> 00:56:51,734
...I thought when I was going to play me.

716
00:56:56,702 --> 00:56:57,737
Okay.

717
00:57:21,382 --> 00:57:22,337
What do you wear?

718
00:57:22,982 --> 00:57:23,937
Hi, Emma.

719
00:57:24,982 --> 00:57:27,018
I've been looking a long time.

720
00:57:27,382 --> 00:57:28,132
Why?

721
00:57:28,462 --> 00:57:30,020
I wanted to talk to you.

722
00:57:31,182 --> 00:57:33,935
Of what?
Emma, ​​do you remember me?

723
00:57:34,102 --> 00:57:35,820
The best washing the dishes.

724
00:57:38,182 --> 00:57:39,774
Finish at six.

725
00:57:43,222 --> 00:57:44,735
I've worked around.

726
00:57:44,942 --> 00:57:47,854
In shops, elevator.

727
00:57:48,502 --> 00:57:50,254
I've even been a model for a while.

728
00:57:50,902 --> 00:57:54,292
I have good guy in a bathing suit.

729
00:57:55,782 --> 00:57:59,661
I was looking to get rid of the plates
and dirty glasses.

730
00:58:00,782 --> 00:58:01,817
And here I am.

731
00:58:02,462 --> 00:58:04,339
Do not you ever Lew?
No.

732
00:58:04,502 --> 00:58:07,539
I think it's home.
She loves to get rid of me.

733
00:58:09,742 --> 00:58:13,212
What do you, Connie?
Why have you come?

734
00:58:13,382 --> 00:58:15,293
I have not yet asked Midge.

735
00:58:17,262 --> 00:58:18,377
I read the newspapers.

736
00:58:20,942 --> 00:58:22,580
Why not have asked for a divorce?

737
00:58:24,222 --> 00:58:25,132
I do not know.

738
00:58:26,222 --> 00:58:29,020
In this happy world, more
loneliness than anything else.

739
00:58:30,742 --> 00:58:33,097
You can find
alone in many places.

740
00:58:34,102 --> 00:58:36,855
In a dance, film,...

741
00:58:38,062 --> 00:58:39,575
...In your room.

742
00:58:41,462 --> 00:58:42,577
That's funny.

743
00:58:44,062 --> 00:58:46,451
Sometimes a little
enough gold to convince...

744
00:58:46,622 --> 00:58:48,738
...That things are
different than they are.

745
00:58:50,142 --> 00:58:51,336
What is it, Connie?

746
00:58:53,262 --> 00:58:54,581
Midge Want a divorce?

747
00:58:55,462 --> 00:58:56,531
Well, it does.

748
00:59:09,902 --> 00:59:11,972
I am not the messenger of Midge.

749
00:59:13,182 --> 00:59:15,650
I love you. I always loved you.

750
00:59:15,822 --> 00:59:18,700
And if in the place of Midge
could not leave you.

751
00:59:20,022 --> 00:59:22,855
I come simply to ask
come with me to Chicago,...

752
00:59:23,022 --> 00:59:24,216
...To my mother.

753
00:59:24,662 --> 00:59:25,458
Why?

754
00:59:25,942 --> 00:59:28,137
He has many years and not well.

755
00:59:28,302 --> 00:59:31,021
You are the wife Midge,
this is your place.

756
00:59:31,182 --> 00:59:33,093
There is enough money
and you are entitled to it.

757
00:59:33,262 --> 00:59:34,331
But he does not like me.

758
00:59:35,142 --> 00:59:37,098
If you would like,
is your only chance.

759
00:59:37,662 --> 00:59:39,300
Before or after you return home.

760
00:59:39,662 --> 00:59:41,334
Do you really think?
Sure.

761
00:59:43,102 --> 00:59:45,172
But we will have to
feed it a little.

762
00:59:48,502 --> 00:59:49,378
Forgive me.

763
00:59:50,982 --> 00:59:54,691
Connie, what you said
that I want,...

764
00:59:55,782 --> 00:59:59,218
...I still want Midge.

765
00:59:59,822 --> 01:00:00,652
I know.

766
01:00:12,622 --> 01:00:15,500
Connoisseurs SAY THAT
KELLY WILL WIN TONIGHT

767
01:00:51,822 --> 01:00:55,815
Three, four, five, six,...

768
01:01:08,142 --> 01:01:09,495
Congratulations, champ.

769
01:01:09,822 --> 01:01:11,335
Johnny, you look good.

770
01:01:11,502 --> 01:01:13,333
Thanks, I'm training.
Yes?

771
01:01:13,662 --> 01:01:17,337
- Are you going to fight you leave?
- Sure, kid, anytime.

772
01:01:20,502 --> 01:01:21,537
We got it, babe.

773
01:01:21,702 --> 01:01:23,658
- Do not be stupid.
- I am not.

774
01:01:24,782 --> 01:01:27,535
Palmer, this is Midge Kelly,
the new middleweight champion.

775
01:01:30,022 --> 01:01:30,977
How are you?

776
01:01:33,302 --> 01:01:34,132
How are you?

777
01:01:59,542 --> 01:02:01,851
Palmer. I did not know it was
woman's name also.

778
01:02:02,022 --> 01:02:05,059
Sorry, had danced
never with a champion boxer.

779
01:02:08,462 --> 01:02:10,498
Hey, you are very strong.

780
01:02:12,182 --> 01:02:14,980
Sorry, I did not believe that the
both were squeezing.

781
01:02:15,142 --> 01:02:18,293
I meant, dance very well.

782
01:02:18,742 --> 01:02:21,734
Do all boxers
have as much pace?

783
01:02:22,422 --> 01:02:24,378
I do not know, I've never danced with anyone.

784
01:02:37,062 --> 01:02:39,053
What? Do I have a dirty face?

785
01:02:39,222 --> 01:02:41,861
I'm sorry, I was looking at?
Yes.

786
01:02:42,542 --> 01:02:46,012
I have no idea to be the
I saw the same man in the ring.

787
01:02:47,222 --> 01:02:49,782
I have said before that
has a beautiful body.

788
01:02:50,142 --> 01:02:51,541
I would like to model it in clay.

789
01:02:52,342 --> 01:02:54,697
- Did you say to mud?
- Yes, a bust.

790
01:02:55,102 --> 01:02:57,297
Or better yet, a figure
full-length.

791
01:02:58,342 --> 01:02:59,980
Are you a sculptor?

792
01:03:00,982 --> 01:03:02,859
Only amateur.

793
01:03:03,822 --> 01:03:04,971
Will you pose for me?

794
01:03:06,982 --> 01:03:08,256
Convince.

795
01:03:21,982 --> 01:03:23,938
Yes, they seem to be in good shape.

796
01:03:24,462 --> 01:03:28,011
But the people what they want
is to have muscles, not strength.

797
01:03:28,182 --> 01:03:29,251
Not at all.

798
01:03:29,462 --> 01:03:32,260
also in terms of
force is no comparison.

799
01:03:34,942 --> 01:03:38,014
You do not want to pose like that, right?

800
01:03:39,222 --> 01:03:41,099
No, no.

801
01:03:57,782 --> 01:03:59,773
You have come early.
Yes.

802
01:03:59,942 --> 01:04:00,977
And that chance?

803
01:04:01,142 --> 01:04:03,861
I've already said, anytime.

804
01:04:15,582 --> 01:04:17,777
Are we there yet?
A few minutes more.

805
01:04:18,262 --> 01:04:20,298
I'm getting tired.
Raise your head.

806
01:04:20,502 --> 01:04:24,461
- That's what makes me tired.
- Shut up, please do not distract me.

807
01:04:24,622 --> 01:04:27,295
I dreamed of being distracted.

808
01:04:36,222 --> 01:04:39,294
How come you married Harris and you?

809
01:04:39,462 --> 01:04:40,531
Do not talk.

810
01:04:43,622 --> 01:04:45,101
I'll answer.

811
01:04:47,102 --> 01:04:50,299
My family told me we were
ruined when you finish studying.

812
01:04:50,822 --> 01:04:52,733
I decided to dedicate the theater.

813
01:04:53,822 --> 01:04:56,290
And instead I married Jerry.

814
01:04:56,862 --> 01:04:58,978
He loves me and I will reciprocate.

815
01:05:00,182 --> 01:05:01,979
I have never regretted.

816
01:05:03,942 --> 01:05:05,421
You mean so far.

817
01:05:10,062 --> 01:05:12,178
You are very sure of yourself, right?

818
01:05:13,302 --> 01:05:14,132
Of course.

819
01:05:16,382 --> 01:05:17,895
What if I say to Jerry?

820
01:05:19,902 --> 01:05:20,891
Do not tell him.

821
01:05:23,262 --> 01:05:24,490
Enough for today.

822
01:05:25,502 --> 01:05:26,378
Great.

823
01:05:38,622 --> 01:05:40,055
How dare you?

824
01:05:43,262 --> 01:05:45,173
You're more real when you're angry.

825
01:05:47,142 --> 01:05:49,417
You have lived too
time between statues.

826
01:06:05,702 --> 01:06:07,738
I fall in love easily, Midge.

827
01:06:09,062 --> 01:06:11,132
This I take it very seriously.

828
01:06:12,462 --> 01:06:13,451
I.

829
01:06:24,662 --> 01:06:26,892
How did you get here, Gracy?

830
01:06:27,062 --> 01:06:30,179
- Thank you for remembering my name.
- Nothing, Gracy.

831
01:06:30,342 --> 01:06:31,695
Do not call me.

832
01:06:32,822 --> 01:06:34,733
What are you up to?

833
01:06:35,262 --> 01:06:37,457
What do you mean, Gracy, say Grace?

834
01:06:37,622 --> 01:06:40,295
Know too well. I know I
of these striking, do not deny.

835
01:06:40,462 --> 01:06:42,532
You and the woman you are bundled Harris.

836
01:06:42,742 --> 01:06:44,175
Is that it?

837
01:06:45,102 --> 01:06:46,854
Scold me as if we were married.

838
01:06:47,022 --> 01:06:49,490
We are going to be and tomorrow
is the best day to do so.

839
01:06:49,662 --> 01:06:52,301
Tomorrow, what a great idea.

840
01:06:52,662 --> 01:06:55,176
Tomorrow, why not?

841
01:06:55,502 --> 01:06:57,857
Tomorrow you have the same
possibilities today.

842
01:06:58,022 --> 01:07:00,172
That is, no, because...

843
01:07:01,422 --> 01:07:04,459
...Guess I'm already married.

844
01:07:06,142 --> 01:07:08,258
You lie.
You think so?

845
01:07:08,582 --> 01:07:12,211
The next time you go to Chicago
approach the 46 of Eagle Street.

846
01:07:12,422 --> 01:07:14,413
And if you find
Mrs. Kelly there...

847
01:07:14,582 --> 01:07:16,220
...I will marry you whenever you want.

848
01:07:16,702 --> 01:07:18,499
Not deceiving you, I'm not kidding.

849
01:07:18,662 --> 01:07:20,892
I've taken for
a fool all the time.

850
01:07:21,062 --> 01:07:24,338
Honey, do not ask me
if he was married.

851
01:07:25,622 --> 01:07:27,374
And after all, who cares?

852
01:07:29,902 --> 01:07:31,301
Do not have gone so wrong with me.

853
01:07:31,982 --> 01:07:34,291
I am committed to
Harris to the ears.

854
01:07:34,582 --> 01:07:35,697
Where are you going?

855
01:07:37,982 --> 01:07:38,732
Out.

856
01:07:38,902 --> 01:07:40,415
I have an appointment with a lady.

857
01:07:41,222 --> 01:07:42,541
Do you know what a lady?

858
01:07:43,342 --> 01:07:44,741
No, impossible.

859
01:07:45,422 --> 01:07:47,140
Do you have knowledge of sculpture?

860
01:07:47,622 --> 01:07:49,135
You know anything about opera?

861
01:07:50,102 --> 01:07:52,696
No, you just know
waste of money.

862
01:07:53,302 --> 01:07:55,452
To another, Grace, we'll see.

863
01:07:55,622 --> 01:07:57,738
I'm with you, do not think
you're going to get rid of me.

864
01:07:58,702 --> 01:07:59,851
You bet.

865
01:08:00,502 --> 01:08:03,414
You left me once
and I abandon you now.

866
01:08:03,902 --> 01:08:04,937
Forever.

867
01:08:06,062 --> 01:08:08,053
Start looking for another
fool who support you.

868
01:08:09,102 --> 01:08:11,935
No, Midge, at first perhaps
seek it, but not now.

869
01:08:12,102 --> 01:08:14,570
I swear, is the first
time in my life.

870
01:08:14,742 --> 01:08:16,255
Please Midge, I'll do anything.

871
01:08:16,542 --> 01:08:18,658
Why not call Johnny Dunne?

872
01:08:18,902 --> 01:08:21,097
Well, dare. Make a fuss...

873
01:08:21,262 --> 01:08:23,332
...That is to move
the city. You'll sink.

874
01:08:24,342 --> 01:08:29,018
No, you're going to be a good girl,...

875
01:08:30,222 --> 01:08:34,374
...Because if you do not send
the hospital for a long time.

876
01:08:36,022 --> 01:08:37,250
I'll change.

877
01:08:39,462 --> 01:08:41,259
I do not want to see you when you leave.

878
01:08:45,022 --> 01:08:47,456
And now you sir,
a great athlete...

879
01:08:47,622 --> 01:08:50,455
...And a true champion, Midge Kelly.

880
01:08:58,462 --> 01:08:59,451
Thank you.

881
01:08:59,902 --> 01:09:03,497
I know I do not applaud me, but
a sport we all want.

882
01:09:03,702 --> 01:09:05,613
I am proud of
to be part...

883
01:09:06,502 --> 01:09:08,174
...And that has helped me a lot.

884
01:09:09,582 --> 01:09:10,856
Thank you very much.

885
01:09:12,782 --> 01:09:14,738
Wonderful speech.

886
01:09:14,902 --> 01:09:16,494
Want to add something else?
No.

887
01:09:16,662 --> 01:09:18,857
Do you think you go to Europe?
Are you going to shoot a film?

888
01:09:19,022 --> 01:09:20,341
Nobody has proposed.

889
01:09:20,502 --> 01:09:22,174
What do you do to keep fit?

890
01:09:22,342 --> 01:09:24,219
Who will be the next fight?

891
01:09:24,382 --> 01:09:26,134
When you are faced with Johnny Dunne?

892
01:09:26,302 --> 01:09:29,339
Give me a break, I have argued
my title four times this year.

893
01:09:29,502 --> 01:09:31,140
Yes, but what happens to Dunne?

894
01:09:31,302 --> 01:09:33,099
Whenever and wherever you want.

895
01:09:33,382 --> 01:09:36,374
Now I'm tired, I just
fight a tough steak.

896
01:09:37,782 --> 01:09:40,535
<i>...where the great champion
Midge Kelly just received...</ i>

897
01:09:40,702 --> 01:09:44,377
...The highest sports award
The Athlete of the Year award.

898
01:09:44,582 --> 01:09:47,813
<i> champion and his manager
have left the dais. </ i>

899
01:09:48,142 --> 01:09:50,292
There are already enough
emotions tonight.

900
01:09:50,462 --> 01:09:52,976
Now rest, we'll talk tomorrow.

901
01:09:53,142 --> 01:09:55,098
May now come to me.

902
01:09:55,342 --> 01:09:57,412
I do not expect you so soon.

903
01:09:58,222 --> 01:10:00,213
Typically, it is now busier.

904
01:10:01,022 --> 01:10:03,900
Yet it is a good son.

905
01:10:05,022 --> 01:10:06,978
It has always been good.

906
01:10:07,262 --> 01:10:09,014
Right, Connie?
Sure.

907
01:10:11,742 --> 01:10:13,414
Try to sleep, Mom.

908
01:10:26,742 --> 01:10:27,811
What is it, Emma?

909
01:10:28,382 --> 01:10:31,180
- I do not want to continue lying.
- It's no lie.

910
01:10:31,342 --> 01:10:33,810
Sooner or later come.
Yes, it's a lie.

911
01:10:34,022 --> 01:10:35,421
I'm not your mother, Connie.

912
01:10:36,422 --> 01:10:38,982
- Do not tell the date, but...
- Connie, please.

913
01:10:39,262 --> 01:10:40,934
Do not treat me like a child.

914
01:10:41,582 --> 01:10:44,221
You have to convince you
itself, although again,...

915
01:10:44,862 --> 01:10:48,059
...Nothing will change for
any of us.

916
01:10:48,702 --> 01:10:49,817
What do you mean?

917
01:10:50,102 --> 01:10:51,455
You know how I feel.

918
01:10:52,502 --> 01:10:54,697
I acknowledge that I had
a long illness,...

919
01:10:55,222 --> 01:10:56,541
...But I'm recovering.

920
01:10:57,062 --> 01:10:58,620
I think it was time.

921
01:10:59,062 --> 01:11:01,576
The explanation of my treatment
I do not feel alone.

922
01:11:01,942 --> 01:11:03,978
I still love him, you know.

923
01:11:04,702 --> 01:11:07,694
Yes? I believe not.

924
01:11:07,862 --> 01:11:11,332
Love can not be
add or remove at will.

925
01:11:11,502 --> 01:11:13,538
Is there a law that
I can tell you not to grow?

926
01:11:13,702 --> 01:11:17,661
Should I wait to condemn
Midge Kelly, back again or not?

927
01:11:18,542 --> 01:11:19,611
Do not you see?

928
01:11:20,462 --> 01:11:23,738
Fortunately I have seen that
there are other people in the world.

929
01:11:24,702 --> 01:11:25,851
Wonderful people.

930
01:11:27,742 --> 01:11:30,859
Suppose you walked through that door now.

931
01:11:31,022 --> 01:11:34,697
Connie, told me once
were no longer the messenger of Midge.

932
01:11:35,262 --> 01:11:38,493
It was also a lie.
You suffer the same disease...

933
01:11:38,662 --> 01:11:40,220
...And you have not yet healed.

934
01:11:40,382 --> 01:11:41,292
Wait a minute.

935
01:11:45,622 --> 01:11:47,294
I've been waiting a long time,...

936
01:11:47,902 --> 01:11:49,858
...I do not blame you
want to be sure.

937
01:11:51,822 --> 01:11:52,971
Can be.

938
01:12:00,222 --> 01:12:02,975
Is not it a strange appointment, Jerry?

939
01:12:03,142 --> 01:12:04,336
Maybe.

940
01:12:04,902 --> 01:12:06,620
Until the circumstances are.

941
01:12:08,502 --> 01:12:10,140
I want to talk quietly with you.

942
01:12:11,342 --> 01:12:13,253
I do not like being taken for a fool.

943
01:12:13,982 --> 01:12:15,859
I know about you and Kelly while.

944
01:12:17,262 --> 01:12:20,220
Really sorry.
I should have said.

945
01:12:20,662 --> 01:12:22,220
Because it's not what you think.

946
01:12:22,542 --> 01:12:24,851
I'm going to marry him.
Do not be stupid.

947
01:12:25,782 --> 01:12:29,138
Look, Palmer, I'm a little
older than you.

948
01:12:29,742 --> 01:12:32,210
On the one hand is good and another bad.

949
01:12:32,622 --> 01:12:35,261
That gives me a certain
degree of understanding.

950
01:12:36,422 --> 01:12:37,855
That man is not for you.

951
01:12:38,022 --> 01:12:40,695
Below appearances
is an object of balance.

952
01:12:40,862 --> 01:12:43,012
You judge it all by
the price tag.

953
01:12:43,342 --> 01:12:44,058
Yes.

954
01:12:44,622 --> 01:12:47,182
And I assure you Boom
more for me than for him.

955
01:12:47,742 --> 01:12:49,221
I have no desire to talk about it.

956
01:12:49,382 --> 01:12:52,340
I do, because the right is me
I want you to know.

957
01:12:53,622 --> 01:12:56,341
I think it's Kelly, I would not have called.

958
01:12:57,062 --> 01:12:59,053
Comes to ask for a new development.

959
01:13:01,622 --> 01:13:04,295
But since you are here I'll
to prove what you just said.

960
01:13:05,902 --> 01:13:07,335
Go to the next room.

961
01:13:09,342 --> 01:13:10,616
No, I will stay.

962
01:13:16,262 --> 01:13:17,456
Hello, Jerry.
Hello.

963
01:13:17,702 --> 01:13:20,694
- Palmer, how are you?
- Hey, Midge.

964
01:13:23,262 --> 01:13:25,298
You got it ready. Great.

965
01:13:25,462 --> 01:13:26,861
Yes, and I'll give you a story.

966
01:13:27,022 --> 01:13:29,536
I have come to an agreement to
you fight with Dunne.

967
01:13:29,702 --> 01:13:30,851
What's the rush?

968
01:13:31,022 --> 01:13:33,138
You spend very quickly and
You have to keep working.

969
01:13:33,382 --> 01:13:35,816
Apart from that you owe me
increases and I want to collect.

970
01:13:35,982 --> 01:13:38,337
All right. Good night.

971
01:13:38,502 --> 01:13:39,332
Wait a minute.

972
01:13:40,062 --> 01:13:41,780
I want to talk to Palmer.

973
01:13:43,102 --> 01:13:44,694
Neither you nor I lose time.

974
01:13:44,862 --> 01:13:46,693
I avoid if I can.

975
01:13:47,662 --> 01:13:49,380
And follow me, if I can.

976
01:13:52,462 --> 01:13:56,580
I see it somewhat difficult, Jerry,
because I love her.

977
01:13:56,742 --> 01:14:00,621
What if I told you what it's worth
to me in dollars and cents?

978
01:14:01,582 --> 01:14:03,937
You owe me a lot of money,
I am willing to forget.

979
01:14:05,262 --> 01:14:08,015
Under the contract, for me to
one third of your earnings.

980
01:14:08,702 --> 01:14:12,217
Here it is. Come, break it.

981
01:14:13,222 --> 01:14:15,577
So the whole bag will keep you
when you win Dunne.

982
01:14:15,902 --> 01:14:17,017
But it breaks.

983
01:14:17,582 --> 01:14:18,537
Now.

984
01:14:19,062 --> 01:14:20,654
Are you kidding?
No.

985
01:14:21,582 --> 01:14:25,416
If you win you took Dunne
$ 65,000 clean.

986
01:14:26,982 --> 01:14:30,099
- 65,000.
- You will not have to give me a penny.

987
01:14:30,702 --> 01:14:31,532
Midge.

988
01:14:35,382 --> 01:14:36,497
It's a lot of money.

989
01:14:37,222 --> 01:14:38,211
Midge.

990
01:14:41,022 --> 01:14:42,296
You're his wife.

991
01:14:43,462 --> 01:14:44,941
You're married to him.

992
01:14:48,262 --> 01:14:50,457
I should not come between the two.

993
01:14:56,862 --> 01:14:58,011
See you, Jerry.

994
01:14:58,182 --> 01:14:59,615
One last tip.

995
01:15:00,662 --> 01:15:02,061
From what I hear...

996
01:15:02,222 --> 01:15:04,053
...If I were you I would train them thoroughly.

997
01:15:05,342 --> 01:15:06,172
Thank you.

998
01:15:12,142 --> 01:15:13,291
¿We went out to dinner?

999
01:15:18,942 --> 01:15:21,012
Telegram champion.
Thank you.

1000
01:15:23,862 --> 01:15:24,692
Thank you.

1001
01:15:31,102 --> 01:15:35,971
MAMA is dying,
COME ASAP. CONNIE.

1002
01:15:46,022 --> 01:15:48,411
Tommy. Pasa.

1003
01:15:53,502 --> 01:15:55,140
Are you going to pay me what I owe?

1004
01:15:56,302 --> 01:15:57,098
Yes.

1005
01:16:01,342 --> 01:16:02,297
Here it is.

1006
01:16:03,142 --> 01:16:04,700
Are we alone?

1007
01:16:05,582 --> 01:16:07,061
- Yes
- Wait.

1008
01:16:07,702 --> 01:16:10,853
Business chatted for a while.

1009
01:16:11,702 --> 01:16:13,977
Let bygones be bygones.

1010
01:16:14,542 --> 01:16:16,737
I want to train
to fight with Dunne.

1011
01:16:16,902 --> 01:16:18,176
I'll give you 10 percent.

1012
01:16:18,702 --> 01:16:20,738
What train again?

1013
01:16:21,422 --> 01:16:22,252
Why?

1014
01:16:23,182 --> 01:16:24,934
Because you're the best.

1015
01:16:26,262 --> 01:16:28,537
You're already a champion.

1016
01:16:29,742 --> 01:16:31,221
What's the matter, you afraid of?

1017
01:16:34,542 --> 01:16:36,214
The 10 percent is not enough.

1018
01:16:37,702 --> 01:16:39,021
How well do you think?

1019
01:16:39,302 --> 01:16:40,894
33 and third.

1020
01:16:42,382 --> 01:16:43,371
Vale.

1021
01:16:44,702 --> 01:16:46,977
Tomorrow at nine in the gym.
Well.

1022
01:16:47,222 --> 01:16:48,211
Wait.

1023
01:16:49,422 --> 01:16:51,413
Not tomorrow, I have to go out.

1024
01:16:52,142 --> 01:16:53,860
Begin on Monday.

1025
01:16:55,062 --> 01:16:56,256
As you say.

1026
01:17:17,142 --> 01:17:18,131
Hello, Midge.

1027
01:17:19,062 --> 01:17:19,858
Pasa.

1028
01:17:20,102 --> 01:17:21,217
Hi, Emma.

1029
01:17:24,382 --> 01:17:26,338
Mama told me in a letter
you were here.

1030
01:17:28,342 --> 01:17:30,458
- How are you?
- You're late.

1031
01:17:39,982 --> 01:17:41,938
It may not be
appropriate to talk about it...

1032
01:17:42,102 --> 01:17:43,820
...But the sooner you know, the better.

1033
01:17:44,342 --> 01:17:46,060
Emma is going to divorce you.

1034
01:17:46,302 --> 01:17:47,735
Then we married.

1035
01:17:53,222 --> 01:17:54,291
Sure.

1036
01:17:56,142 --> 01:17:57,894
Of course, Emma and you.

1037
01:17:58,062 --> 01:18:01,611
Sounds good to me. I wish you luck.

1038
01:18:02,622 --> 01:18:03,372
Thank you.

1039
01:18:12,542 --> 01:18:13,941
Yes, it's great.

1040
01:18:15,222 --> 01:18:17,338
Do not want to wait
until after the fight?

1041
01:18:17,542 --> 01:18:18,372
Why?

1042
01:18:19,342 --> 01:18:23,051
Connie, do not blame it
think of me, you're right.

1043
01:18:23,222 --> 01:18:25,782
But I would like to fix things.

1044
01:18:27,822 --> 01:18:28,652
With the two.

1045
01:18:30,542 --> 01:18:32,453
He recovered to Tommy.

1046
01:18:33,982 --> 01:18:34,937
It's true.

1047
01:18:36,062 --> 01:18:37,893
Will you return too?

1048
01:18:38,062 --> 01:18:40,576
The two. Not until after the fight.

1049
01:18:40,742 --> 01:18:42,095
It will be a tough fight.

1050
01:18:42,462 --> 01:18:43,895
And possibly the last.

1051
01:18:44,062 --> 01:18:45,575
I'm considering leaving it.

1052
01:18:47,142 --> 01:18:50,054
In summary, I
you to be there with me.

1053
01:18:55,702 --> 01:18:57,613
Mom would have liked.

1054
01:19:03,862 --> 01:19:04,658
Emma.

1055
01:19:08,782 --> 01:19:10,181
If you want, Connie.

1056
01:19:11,822 --> 01:19:12,698
Okay.

1057
01:19:42,382 --> 01:19:43,656
It looks good.

1058
01:19:44,542 --> 01:19:47,420
The delighted that
you go back to being together.

1059
01:19:47,822 --> 01:19:49,858
I was hoping to react.

1060
01:19:51,342 --> 01:19:52,855
Come on time.

1061
01:19:54,902 --> 01:19:56,460
So soon?
Yes.

1062
01:19:59,102 --> 01:20:02,060
Today these great champions.
Do you think?

1063
01:20:08,542 --> 01:20:09,338
The food.

1064
01:20:14,542 --> 01:20:16,419
Wait, what if I dejarais a little?

1065
01:20:16,582 --> 01:20:20,700
Yes, eat something. This is what
best I've tasted.

1066
01:20:20,862 --> 01:20:23,012
No more milk, bring more.

1067
01:20:49,502 --> 01:20:50,776
You've already packed their bags.

1068
01:20:51,142 --> 01:20:52,814
Yes, do you? Are not we going today?

1069
01:20:52,982 --> 01:20:55,621
I bit late, I have brought almost nothing.
Where is Connie?

1070
01:20:55,782 --> 01:20:58,057
He went to town with Tommy
for the tickets.

1071
01:20:58,222 --> 01:20:59,894
- How do you feel?
- Very good.

1072
01:21:00,702 --> 01:21:02,818
I wish the fight was
today instead of tomorrow.

1073
01:21:02,982 --> 01:21:05,052
Connie says she never
you looked so fit.

1074
01:21:08,702 --> 01:21:11,694
Where are you going to divorce?

1075
01:21:11,942 --> 01:21:14,217
I do not know, when it comes
when you decide.

1076
01:21:14,662 --> 01:21:15,777
A Reno perhaps.

1077
01:21:16,462 --> 01:21:17,497
Wait a minute.

1078
01:21:22,782 --> 01:21:24,977
Why shun me when
attempt to come to you?

1079
01:21:25,262 --> 01:21:26,058
I?

1080
01:21:26,782 --> 01:21:28,181
I still hate it?

1081
01:21:28,982 --> 01:21:31,621
Do not hate you, Midge, I've never hated.

1082
01:21:32,862 --> 01:21:33,977
I'm afraid.

1083
01:21:34,582 --> 01:21:36,174
Do not be conceited.

1084
01:21:37,262 --> 01:21:39,696
Give me a kiss goodbye.
No.

1085
01:21:40,262 --> 01:21:41,297
Are you afraid?

1086
01:21:49,542 --> 01:21:50,770
Still in love with me.

1087
01:21:51,022 --> 01:21:52,216
No, no.

1088
01:21:53,222 --> 01:21:56,180
Please leave me alone.

1089
01:21:59,102 --> 01:22:00,171
You are my wife.

1090
01:22:19,702 --> 01:22:21,613
Hi, Connie, where do you get?

1091
01:22:23,862 --> 01:22:25,375
I've been looking all day.

1092
01:22:25,902 --> 01:22:28,097
You had left the hotel.
Do not you got my message?

1093
01:22:28,262 --> 01:22:29,741
I wanted to be alone.

1094
01:22:29,902 --> 01:22:32,621
Emma is gone. And you know why?

1095
01:22:32,782 --> 01:22:34,261
No. Why?

1096
01:22:35,062 --> 01:22:38,213
Yes, you've changed, you are now
worse, you have been frozen blood.

1097
01:22:38,942 --> 01:22:40,091
Outside, Connie.

1098
01:22:41,742 --> 01:22:42,891
I have to rest.

1099
01:22:43,382 --> 01:22:45,213
I finally reached my shift.

1100
01:22:45,422 --> 01:22:47,378
As for Emma, ​​once was not enough.

1101
01:22:47,582 --> 01:22:49,459
You could not let her live in peace and happy?

1102
01:22:49,662 --> 01:22:50,777
Why did you do?

1103
01:22:51,062 --> 01:22:52,017
Why are you bored?

1104
01:22:52,182 --> 01:22:54,332
You wanted to prove
you're the champ?

1105
01:22:54,862 --> 01:22:55,897
You suck!

1106
01:22:56,142 --> 01:22:59,418
You reek of corruption! You're worse
a grave robber!

1107
01:23:08,302 --> 01:23:09,291
Come on.

1108
01:24:11,342 --> 01:24:13,378
Ladies and gentlemen,
as you will, of course,...

1109
01:24:13,542 --> 01:24:15,498
...The champion makes his
entry into the stadium.

1110
01:24:15,662 --> 01:24:18,335
Most of the spectators
have risen.

1111
01:24:18,742 --> 01:24:20,334
We welcome with enthusiasm.

1112
01:24:20,582 --> 01:24:23,415
There is no doubt,
most popular is the champion...

1113
01:24:23,822 --> 01:24:25,380
...In the history of boxing.

1114
01:24:26,302 --> 01:24:27,451
What a welcome.

1115
01:24:28,102 --> 01:24:31,174
Indeed, tonight hailed
something more than a man.

1116
01:24:31,822 --> 01:24:33,301
Cheer for a story.

1117
01:24:33,902 --> 01:24:36,621
A story that could only
occur in the boxing world.

1118
01:24:36,902 --> 01:24:40,577
The story of a man who, starting
of the most sordid poverty,...

1119
01:24:40,902 --> 01:24:43,621
...Has become
World Champion.

1120
01:25:02,622 --> 01:25:04,419
When I say outside, I separáis.

1121
01:25:04,582 --> 01:25:06,413
In case of fall,
going to a neutral corner.

1122
01:25:06,582 --> 01:25:08,812
Daos hand. Good luck
and good fight.

1123
01:25:47,902 --> 01:25:51,531
Four, five, six,...

1124
01:25:52,502 --> 01:25:56,256
...Seven, eight, nine,...

1125
01:25:56,422 --> 01:25:57,298
Go on.

1126
01:26:19,302 --> 01:26:21,691
It does not fall. I've stuck with
everything but an ax.

1127
01:26:21,862 --> 01:26:23,932
Attentive and do not neglect.

1128
01:26:50,302 --> 01:26:52,941
We are seeing a big fight.
A fight to remember.

1129
01:26:53,102 --> 01:26:55,457
The audience that filled
The location is satisfied.

1130
01:26:55,622 --> 01:26:58,534
The Tale of Johnny Dunne
back to the canvas in good shape.

1131
01:26:58,702 --> 01:27:00,977
And attacking from the first
round without rest.

1132
01:27:01,462 --> 01:27:02,781
The champion, meanwhile,...

1133
01:27:02,942 --> 01:27:04,853
The bell rings,
I leave you with Bill Brown.

1134
01:27:05,022 --> 01:27:08,651
Thank you, Sam. Leave the two fast,
without losing a moment.

1135
01:27:16,782 --> 01:27:19,979
Please note, Kelly has a cut on
the eyebrow. This can be crucial.

1136
01:27:31,502 --> 01:27:34,175
Kelly Dunne hits after
the bell, but apologizes.

1137
01:27:34,582 --> 01:27:36,538
The champion, however, it fits well.

1138
01:27:36,702 --> 01:27:38,772
Above all,
both are athletes.

1139
01:27:39,662 --> 01:27:43,814
I see Haley working
Kelly eyebrow wound.

1140
01:27:46,062 --> 01:27:48,622
The brow, Johnny. Punish him the eyebrow.

1141
01:28:14,502 --> 01:28:16,891
The tide has turned
definitely in this fight.

1142
01:28:17,062 --> 01:28:20,498
Dunne, in my humble opinion, is
has scored the last three rounds.

1143
01:28:20,662 --> 01:28:23,813
And Kelly, with one eye covered,
not respond as it should.

1144
01:28:24,222 --> 01:28:26,178
It will produce a
surprising result.

1145
01:28:52,182 --> 01:28:54,218
Literally, you are doing
Kelly pieces.

1146
01:28:54,382 --> 01:28:55,861
I have not seen anything like it.

1147
01:28:56,022 --> 01:28:59,332
I do not know why Kelly keeps up,
if not outright anger.

1148
01:28:59,502 --> 01:29:01,015
Of not being in the title game...

1149
01:29:01,182 --> 01:29:03,412
...The fight and would have
interrupted while.

1150
01:29:24,182 --> 01:29:26,980
It's over, you can not
still fit hits.

1151
01:29:27,142 --> 01:29:28,461
I'll throw in the towel.

1152
01:29:28,662 --> 01:29:31,176
I'll kill you. If you do, I'll kill you.

1153
01:29:31,422 --> 01:29:34,539
- You want to end up, champ?
- No, do not stop, please.

1154
01:29:34,702 --> 01:29:35,851
You can not stop.

1155
01:29:38,022 --> 01:29:39,580
What beat is giving you.

1156
01:30:14,342 --> 01:30:16,378
This has been done,
Kelly is exhausted.

1157
01:30:16,542 --> 01:30:19,340
At all, is knocked out, finished.

1158
01:30:19,502 --> 01:30:21,333
Tonight we'll have a new champion.

1159
01:30:56,942 --> 01:31:01,493
Four, five, six, seven,...

1160
01:31:02,822 --> 01:31:06,576
...Eight, nine, ten.

1161
01:31:20,462 --> 01:31:21,690
Come a physician.

1162
01:31:29,342 --> 01:31:31,060
That no man.

1163
01:31:33,222 --> 01:31:35,577
Connie, this way.

1164
01:31:36,822 --> 01:31:38,414
I know from the public.

1165
01:31:39,222 --> 01:31:40,257
Have you heard?

1166
01:31:40,542 --> 01:31:43,579
Every time I hit...
Sure, kid.

1167
01:31:44,222 --> 01:31:45,621
The doctor will follow suit.

1168
01:31:46,422 --> 01:31:49,141
You sound like a kid, you say nonsense.

1169
01:31:49,742 --> 01:31:53,018
I won the fight.
Have not you heard people?

1170
01:31:53,942 --> 01:31:58,174
For the first time in my life
the audience cheering me.

1171
01:31:58,982 --> 01:32:00,859
Have not you heard? Are you deaf?

1172
01:32:01,822 --> 01:32:05,292
We do not do auto-stop.
Now we drive.

1173
01:32:08,982 --> 01:32:12,895
Listen, Haley, those guys
bellied with pure...

1174
01:32:13,062 --> 01:32:14,939
...No shoves at my expense.

1175
01:32:17,742 --> 01:32:20,734
We tumbaré, you know I can.

1176
01:32:49,302 --> 01:32:52,658
Tommy, Tommy.

1177
01:32:57,502 --> 01:32:58,457
Midge.

1178
01:33:07,542 --> 01:33:09,897
I heard on the station. How are you?

1179
01:33:14,862 --> 01:33:15,738
He is dead.

1180
01:33:16,902 --> 01:33:17,891
Cerebral hemorrhage.

1181
01:33:25,982 --> 01:33:27,574
I know it's bad now but...

1182
01:33:27,902 --> 01:33:30,018
...Could you say a few words
about his brother?

1183
01:33:31,182 --> 01:33:32,854
Want a word?

1184
01:33:36,022 --> 01:33:36,898
All right.

1185
01:33:38,822 --> 01:33:40,175
I say a few words.

1186
01:33:49,502 --> 01:33:50,696
He was a champion.

1187
01:33:52,222 --> 01:33:53,780
He behaved like a champ.

1188
01:33:56,702 --> 01:34:00,456
It was an honor for
boxing until the end.
