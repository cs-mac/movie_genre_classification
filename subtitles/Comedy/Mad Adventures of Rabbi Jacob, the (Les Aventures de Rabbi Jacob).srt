00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,200
The Extraordinary Adventures
of Adele Blanc-Sec

2
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,200
Ferdinand Choupard is a minor
character in our story.

3
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,000
Nonetheless, he is where this
adventure begins,

4
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:28,200
as he wandered home

5
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
after an evening spent
playing cards

6
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,200
and sipping a marvellous
12-year-old malt whisky.

7
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,100
It was November 4th, 1911,

8
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,900
at 1 o'clock in the morning.

9
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,000
The streets were empty with
a chilly nip in the air.

10
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,200
Yet, at the same time,
exactly 953 metres from there,

11
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,200
the city was jumping.

12
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,200
On stage, Nicole Gambert,

13
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,200
or Nini-les-Gambettes,
kicked up a storm.

14
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:00,000
The enthusiastic audience
revelled in the show.

15
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,200
I love you.

16
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Wonderful.

17
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,100
Great.

18
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,000
Every evening was a triumph.

19
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,200
From the gent over there.

20
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,000
And every evening for nearly a month,

21
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:27,000
Raymond Pointrenaud,
a former Prefect,

22
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:32,200
celebrated his promotion to Paris as
Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.

23
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:37,200
Meanwhile, Ferdinand had barely
travelled the 280 metres

24
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:42,200
that separate La Concorde
from Place des Pyramides.

25
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,000
Don't be shy!
You've seen others!

26
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,100
Oh my God!

27
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:08,100
Ferdinand's visions were
in fact an optical illusion.

28
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:14,000
The frenzied lights came from the home
of Professor Marie-Joseph Esperandieu.

29
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,100
This eminent scientist and
expert on Ancient Egypt

30
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:21,200
had obtained a degree
in physics aged only 16.

31
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
His research culminated
35 years later

32
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:30,000
in a book with the evocative title,
Is There A Life After Death?

33
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,000
At the same moment, across the Seine,

34
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:37,200
the question seemed
to have been settled long ago.

35
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,200
Yet, on the first floor,

36
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,200
a life form that contravened
the laws of science

37
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,200
was about to give
the scientist his answer.

38
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,100
As the century's most
amazing experiment

39
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,200
took place before our eyes,

40
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:07,100
Inspector Albert Caponi
had his tightly shut.

41
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:13,100
Of course, had he seen the
pterodactyl fly by his window,

42
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,200
our story would have been
drastically different,

43
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:19,000
but for now no one could blame

44
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:21,100
the inspector for his somnolence.

45
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,100
His stoutness and perseverance
had previously earned him

46
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:27,000
a good many distinctions,

47
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:30,000
including the Medal of Merit
for solving

48
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:34,000
the mystery of the missing
persons of Dreux asylum.

49
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,100
He was decorated

50
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:39,000
on August 28th, 1907,

51
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,000
by the Prefect Raymond
Pointrenaud in person.

52
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,200
Raymond! What are you doing?

53
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:48,100
Let my little bird
land on your branches.

54
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,900
You devil! Nothing arouses
me more than poetry.

55
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,000
Really?

56
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,000
Yes!

57
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:58,200
As the night recedes,

58
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:02,100
the dew in the branch
prepares to fall

59
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:06,000
And the bird in the
nest to open its eyes...

60
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,200
Drive normally, can't you?

61
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,100
Goodness me! Get out! Get out!

62
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,100
Hello!

63
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,000
Caponi speaking.

64
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,200
In the Seine?

65
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,200
In the Seine?

66
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,100
Oh my God!

67
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,000
Oh my God!

68
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,000
Oh my God!

69
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,200
Oh my God! Help me find the words.

70
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,100
This young man's a scientist too,

71
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,100
but a humble assistant,
working at the Botanical Gardens.

72
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,100
His name's Zborowsky and he's 23.

73
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Science isn't his only passion.

74
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,100
He has another,
more voracious one.

75
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:18,200
Dear... Miss Adele...

76
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,100
What if she's married?

77
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,100
Or even worse, widowed?

78
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:28,100
Yes, his second passion is unconditional
love for Miss Adele Blanc-Sec.

79
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,000
A passion she provoked
with these few words...

80
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,000
Who's it for?

81
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:40,100
For Zbo... bo...
bobo rowsky.

82
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,200
First name, perhaps?

83
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,100
Yes.

84
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,000
Which is?

85
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:49,100
Andrej, with aj, as in jaguar.

86
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,100
Oh, I'd love this one.

87
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,100
A jaguar.

88
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,000
Oh.

89
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,000
Thank you!

90
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:22,200
Andrej Zborowsky was
definitively lost to science.

91
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,100
As for Adele Blanc-Sec
and her sense of humour,

92
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,900
they had set off on a new adventure,
much less monstrous and much more exotic,

93
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:31,100
since her publisher
had sent her to Peru

94
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:37,200
to unravel the mystery
of the last Incas.

95
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,000
Something you should
know about Adele,

96
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,200
to really understand her...

97
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
She listens to her instincts,
not her publisher.

98
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:50,100
Aziz, how many hours'
ride to the rendezvous?

99
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,200
In this heat,
at least six, Miss Adele.

100
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,000
Very well. Let's move out.

101
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,000
What's "move" in Arabic?

102
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,000
Yalla, Miss Adele.

103
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,000
Yalla

104
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
And "Move, you ass,
or you're dead"?

105
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,000
Stop!

106
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,900
Is this it?

107
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,100
I think so.

108
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,100
Very well.

109
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,200
You need to drink

110
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,000
a lot of water in this heat.

111
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:51,200
These are the two men
I told you about.

112
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,100
A cup of tea before the drop?

113
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,200
I look like I drink tea?

114
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,200
Is this the tomb room?

115
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,200
Not yet.

116
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:34,000
It's the embalming room,
where the mummies were prepared.

117
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:36,200
The bodies were gutted on the altar
and the entrails thrown in these pots.

118
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:46,000
Then, after a quick wash, they were
powdered, made up and dressed.

119
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:51,000
What was this for?

120
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:54,200
Made-to-measure suits.

121
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,200
The body goes here
and the machine

122
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,000
wraps it in 20
layers of bandages.

123
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:01,000
Not to mention the oil,
squirted between each layer.

124
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:05,000
What kind of oil is it?

125
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,000
No idea, but it worked a treat.

126
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,200
Found it!

127
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:17,100
Yes, this is it. Gents,
let's see your treasure.

128
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,100
Death...

129
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:35,100
is the only path...
that leads... to birth.

130
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:06,000
Your journey ends here,
darling.

131
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:09,000
To thank you for
your cooperation,

132
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:12,000
we'll spare your life.
Get lost!

133
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:15,000
Fine Egyptian hospitality!

134
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:17,100
Yes, but he's not Egyptian.

135
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Great...

136
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:24,000
A peculiarly inflammable
mix of oil and petroleum.

137
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,200
Enter with even a tiny match
and there'll be fireworks.

138
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:35,000
Let me know when your gentlemen's
club is open to women.

139
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:36,200
Excuse me.

140
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:57,100
Just as I thought.

141
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:10,000
Miss! After careful consideration,

142
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,200
we accept your application.

143
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,200
Allow me to save my
emotion for later.

144
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,000
That's that bit done.

145
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:56,000
Hold on a sec...
Where'd you learn all this?

146
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:59,000
There are only two ways.
Be Egyptian or learn to read.

147
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:08,000
Amazing!

148
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:15,000
Allah is great!

149
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,200
I make a fortune.
I make a fortune.

150
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,200
Here he is...

151
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,100
C'mon, they're down there!

152
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:09,000
Even without the stone, it's very
heavy. How will we ever get it out?

153
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,000
In tombs like this,
there's a way in and a way out.

154
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,100
Find it.

155
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:16,000
Yes, Miss Adele.

156
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,100
Open it.

157
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,100
Hey, wait.

158
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:26,000
Opening a pharaoh's tomb is sacrilege.
You can hang for that.

159
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,000
What punishment for
taking his gold?

160
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
None.

161
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,100
Beware, you witch!

162
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,100
I won't leave without my gold.

163
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I fear you're right.

164
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:01,000
Money can't buy happiness,
Aziz. Open it!

165
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,900
That's your pharaoh?

166
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,200
No, a doctor.

167
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,100
Don't move.

168
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,900
If it's for a consultation, miss,

169
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
you may be a bit late.

170
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
However, I know a specialist
institute in Cairo,

171
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:31,100
where the doctors would be
delighted to examine you.

172
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:36,900
I'm fine, thank you. Except for the nausea
I feel in your presence, Prof. Dieuleveult.

173
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:42,000
Still the same caustic sense of humour,
my dear Adele. You'll need it.

174
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,000
Meanwhile,

175
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,000
tell me why a great reporter
like you is here looting tombs.

176
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Not looting, borrowing.

177
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:53,900
Of course! You're taking him for
a walk to get some fresh air.

178
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:56,100
Pattnosis is a professor of medicine,

179
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,200
Ramses II's personal doctor.

180
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,900
The greatest medical
expert in Ancient Egypt.

181
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,000
Fortunately, because...
I need his expertise.

182
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:08,000
Would that be to cure humankind?

183
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,200
No, just my sister. She's ill.

184
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
How very thoughtful and touching!

185
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:19,100
But has it crossed your mind that
your professor is... dead?

186
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,000
I'd noticed, thank you.

187
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,100
How will you resuscitate him?

188
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
May I?

189
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,000
Is There A Life After Death?
That old fool, Esperandieu?

190
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
He's barely able to
spin a chair round.

191
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:41,100
He'll be dead before he
revives this old mummy!

192
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,000
Mind your language!

193
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Mummies hear everything we say

194
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
and detest disrespect.

195
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:51,000
You're scaring me!
After the Ice Monster,

196
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
here comes the Sand Zombie!

197
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:54,100
Watch out, he's a real grouch!

198
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,000
My dear Adele,

199
00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:00,000
I confess I'm one of
your most avid readers,

200
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:05,100
but this is by far the silliest
story you've ever told.

201
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,000
Take her away!

202
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:10,000
Yes, sir!

203
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,000
Come along. Hurry!

204
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,000
The way out?

205
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
I checked
every wall. Nothing.

206
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:19,000
It must be in the middle.

207
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,100
The tomb's in the middle.

208
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,200
See? You found it.

209
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,200
Hurry up. Let's go!

210
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,100
Damn rainwater!

211
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:57,100
You know the punishment
for tomb raiders?

212
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,200
Hanging.

213
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
For locals only.

214
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Foreigners are given more
consideration

215
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,100
and a swift death.

216
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
More protocol,
but much less pain.

217
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,100
Miss! Miss!

218
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:15,000
A last wish perhaps?

219
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:19,000
It's not very good
for my health,

220
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:21,000
but I'd appreciate a cigarette.

221
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:27,000
Why not? One won't kill you!

222
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,000
Thank you.

223
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:35,200
It's magnificent.

224
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,000
Yes.

225
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:37,900
May I?

226
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,200
Yes.

227
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,100
A gift, I suppose?

228
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
A memento, actually.

229
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:52,000
My father. On his death.

230
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,200
Oh

231
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:57,900
It's better this way. Whenever
I use it, I think of him.

232
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,200
Oh

233
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:06,100
I'd like to give you a souvenir.

234
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,200
Really?

235
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,000
Whenever you use it,
think of me.

236
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,000
Into my arms!

237
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Forgive me the sudden intimacy.

238
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,000
Excuse me, my good man!

239
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,100
Cairo?

240
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:28,000
Thanks.

241
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:42,000
Put him on the table.

242
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Calm down. Careful!
We'll take care of you.

243
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,100
Scissor.

244
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:55,100
Calm down, Professor. Oxygen!

245
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,000
We're nearly there.

246
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:05,100
I'll kill that woman!
Oxygen!

247
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:07,100
I'll kill her!
Oxygen!

248
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:09,200
I'll kill her! Breathe in!

249
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:10,200
I'll kill her! Breathe in!

250
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,200
Blow out! Blow out!

251
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Fifty!

252
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Mr. Choupard,

253
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:29,900
how can I believe a man with
50% alcohol on his breath?

254
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
I swear it's true,
Commissioner.

255
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Inspector.

256
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,100
Inspector, yes. The bird swooped
onto the car

257
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:38,200
and pecked it to pieces!

258
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:42,000
And Prefo Pectoral... was aboard.

259
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Ex-Prefect.

260
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,200
And he had a scantily
clad woman next to him.

261
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:50,100
A scantily clad woman?

262
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:55,000
With Pointrenaud, founder of
Christian Aid? Nonsense!

263
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:57,000
I know, but I saw her!

264
00:25:57,100 --> 00:26:00,000
Like you saw Joan of
Arc ablaze once more.

265
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Sir...

266
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,000
We've identified the dead.

267
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,100
There were three passengers
in the vehicle.

268
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,200
Pointrenaud, his driver, and...

269
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Good Lord!

270
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,100
What did I tell you?

271
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,000
To the drunk tank!

272
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:25,200
I'm innocent!
It's the big bird that did it!

273
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
I was just going home.

274
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:32,000
Gentlemen, until we find out
more about this tragedy,

275
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:37,200
I'm relying on you to keep
this case confidential.

276
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Of course, sir.

277
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:43,000
Not a word to the press.
No, sir.

278
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:47,200
The Prefect and the Showgirl!

279
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:51,100
Their Dance with Death!

280
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:54,200
Giant Bird Preys
on the Capital!

281
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,200
Get The Little Parisian today!

282
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Giant Bird Preys on the Capital!

283
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Giant Bird Preys on the Capital!

284
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Monster Kills Prefect!

285
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,200
Police Clueless!

286
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,200
Read all about it!

287
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,200
There you are, sir.

288
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:14,000
Monster Kills Prefect!
Police Clueless!

289
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,300
A pterodactyl? How grotesque!

290
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
They'll do anything
to sell their rag.

291
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,000
Even Le Gaulois has run it.

292
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:25,100
They'll panic people, that's all.

293
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,100
Probably. It's the talk of the town.

294
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:33,000
Send poor Pointrenaud's widow
our condolences.

295
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:34,100
Yes, Mr. President.

296
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:42,900
A Prefect with a showgirl, perhaps.
But a pterodactyl? In the 20th century!

297
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:49,000
You sent for me, sir?

298
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,000
Yes. Call the Interior.

299
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,900
Good morning, sir.

300
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:03,200
This pterodactyl business sounds
serious. It could be anarchists

301
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,200
up to their tricks.

302
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Look into it and
keep me informed.

303
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:09,200
Leave it to me, sir.

304
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,200
Call the Prefect.

305
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:18,000
Hello!
En...

306
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Minister.

307
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:21,000
This pterodactyl
business is dragging on.

308
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:23,200
The President wants
results this week.

309
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:25,100
I'll take care of it, sir.

310
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,200
Call Police Headquarters.

311
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:33,000
Yes? Dugptnmier?

312
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:35,100
Who's on the pterodactyl case?

313
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:37,100
Captain Poissard.

314
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,100
Hardly surprising
it's going nowhere!

315
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,200
We need more energy.
A sleuth!

316
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:44,200
Give him 72 hours to
obtain results.

317
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,200
I'm on the job, sir.

318
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,100
Get me Cheval!

319
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:50,100
Hello!

320
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:54,200
We have to solve this fast.
You have 48 hours.

321
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,200
Consider it done, sir.

322
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:08,100
What a mess!

323
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,100
Caponi speaking.

324
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,000
Cheval here.

325
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:22,000
Good morning, Commissioner.

326
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:24,100
I've put you on the
pterodactyl case.

327
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,100
Don't let me down.
Our reputation's at stake.

328
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,900
I'll do my best, sir.

329
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,100
You have 24 hours.

330
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:32,100
Thank you, sir.

331
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:41,900
Where'd an animal
like that come from?

332
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,200
Look...

333
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,000
It wasn't like that.

334
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:50,100
Of course not, Andrej.

335
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,200
This egg's always
been in my care.

336
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:54,000
What happened?

337
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,200
Yesterday, an attendant
noticed broken glass.

338
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:59,000
He blamed it on
a careless visitor

339
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:01,000
and simply replaced the glass.

340
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,000
People are so clumsy!

341
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:04,200
It's more complicated
than that.

342
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:07,100
Look at the remains
of the shell.

343
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Most are still connected to
the amniotic membrane,

344
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,100
as if the force that
cracked the egg

345
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:15,100
came from...

346
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,100
The inside?

347
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,200
Exactly.

348
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:21,100
But that would mean the egg...

349
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,100
Hatched, Zborowsky.

350
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:28,100
After 135 million
years' gestation,

351
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:32,100
it emerged from
its shell and flew away.

352
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,100
Through there!

353
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,200
In that case,

354
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,100
could it be related to
the pterodactyl in the press?

355
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:45,000
You'd have made an
excellent policeman.

356
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:46,000
Professor Menard?

357
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:47,100
Yes?

358
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,100
Inspector Caponi.

359
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:52,000
What can I do for you?

360
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,000
I'm in charge of
the petro dactyl case.

361
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,900
Ptero dactyl.

362
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
That's what I said.

363
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:01,900
Seeing the bone collection
in your museum,

364
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:04,000
I thought maybe you could help.

365
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:07,000
I'm strictly a Cretaceous man.

366
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:11,100
I'd suggest you see a
specialist in the Jurassic.

367
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:15,000
Look, I have 24 hours
to solve this.

368
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:17,000
I can't go visiting Jura.

369
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:24,000
Let me find you a specialist
in Paris in that case.

370
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:25,000
Most kind of you.

371
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:31,000
Say...

372
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,100
That egg... It'd make
a heck of an omelette.

373
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,100
Please follow me.

374
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Yes, of course.

375
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,100
I'll keep you informed
of developments.

376
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,200
Please do.

377
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,100
Goodbye.

378
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:19,100
Come on...
Don't be scared. Come on.

379
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,900
Look what I've got for you.

380
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Smells good.

381
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,200
Come on...

382
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:51,100
This is it, sir. Up there.

383
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:54,000
Excellent!
Fetch me a black coffee

384
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:55,200
and something to nibble on.

385
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
I can't think on an empty stomach.

386
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,000
You want more? Eat, my baby, eat!

387
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:10,900
That's good, my baby.

388
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,200
Yes? What do you want?

389
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,100
Inspector Caponi.

390
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,100
I have some questions for you
about the fero dactyl.

391
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,100
Ptero dactyl, sir.

392
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:32,000
I was told you're
a specialist.

393
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:39,100
Yes, that's right. But this isn't a...
I was about to eat.

394
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,100
Perfect, that's our speciality.

395
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,200
Well, please come in then.

396
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,100
Goodness, it's dark in here.

397
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,100
I'm very sensitive to light.

398
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,200
Please, take a seat.

399
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:08,100
En.

400
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:20,100
Thanks, Jeannot. May I? I haven't
eaten in 2 days. Go ahead.

401
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:25,000
So, how can I be of help?

402
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:27,000
Tell me about the animal.

403
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:29,100
What it eats, where it sleeps...

404
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,100
We know very little
about its habits.

405
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:33,200
We do know it's a carnivore.

406
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,100
Quite fight!

407
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,200
Nothing beats a
rare rib of beef!

408
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:41,200
What's that?

409
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:46,000
It's the toucan.

410
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:51,100
Please go on, Professor.

411
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:57,200
It has a wingspan of
about... six metres,

412
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:01,200
and can fly for hours on end,
looking for food...

413
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,100
to take back to the nest.

414
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:07,100
There's a nest of them?

415
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:10,100
No, I mean... There's only one.

416
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,100
En

417
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:15,100
But at the time,
when they had a mate,

418
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:18,000
finding food and
building a nest

419
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,200
were their main activities.

420
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:24,000
Mating took place once a year

421
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,000
and for reasons as yet unknown,

422
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,200
they only laid
one egg at a time.

423
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:37,000
Which explains their aggressive
nature, especially...

424
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:43,200
when it came to defending their
one... and only offspring.

425
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:45,900
Amazing!

426
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,000
Sir, the toucan's...

427
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:01,900
Help! Help! Jesus!

428
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:24,100
It's because of the egg.
It was too much for him.

429
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:27,900
The man's deranged!
Take him away!

430
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:51,200
Sorry.

431
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,100
Need a porter?

432
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:54,100
I wouldn't say no.

433
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,200
Adele

434
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Mr Xavier? How kind.

435
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,100
My only hope of seeing you,
my dear,

436
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,200
as you travel far and near,

437
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:09,100
is if I lie in wait
for you here.

438
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:10,100
Very good!

439
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:16,000
Gently! It's fragile.

440
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:17,300
Yes, ma'am.

441
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,100
NO 28, Rue du Four, please.

442
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:28,100
So? Peru?

443
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,100
Far! Very far.

444
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:33,000
And very high.

445
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:34,900
Indeed.

446
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,200
You made it up Machu Picchu?

447
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,100
Every morning.

448
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:42,100
very morning!
Is it indiscreet to ask

449
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:46,000
what treasure you bring us
in that fine box?

450
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:50,200
A pipe. An Andean pipe.

451
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:52,000
A pipe?

452
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:53,000
The large model.
A sacred pipe

453
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:55,100
I wrenched from the tomb
of the last Inca king.

454
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:56,200
No!

455
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:58,200
Yes! Fatal for the
uninitiated player,

456
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,100
so don't touch.

457
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:02,100
Definitely not.

458
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:06,000
Tell me, my good man,
is this a cab or a B&B?

459
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,100
I'd love to get
moving, lady,

460
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:11,000
but these damn nags
are blocking the road.

461
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:14,100
When will they
ban horses from Paris?

462
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,000
This is the 20th century!

463
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,000
Move! You moron,

464
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
or you are dad!

465
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Oh, what happened?

466
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:28,300
Where we were just now?

467
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:41,000
What hocus-pocus
have you brought back now?

468
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:44,000
Miranda, mind your language
and help with the bags.

469
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,000
I just cleaned your room.

470
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:52,200
You bring back these old dirty
relics again.

471
00:38:56,200 --> 00:39:02,000
I'll take care of this one personally.
What's all this mail?

472
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,200
The young man from
the Botanical Gardens.

473
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:09,100
A letter a day,

474
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,200
and two Monday to
make up for Sunday.

475
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:17,100
Reminds me of my youth in
Andalusia, in my mother's family.

476
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:21,000
There was a young picador,
strong as his bulls...

477
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,200
How is Agathe?

478
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Fine. She's been very good.

479
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:28,000
But she eats less and less.

480
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:30,000
Soon she'll be skin and bone.

481
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:31,100
We'll take good care of her.

482
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,000
Thank you, Miranda,

483
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,100
for your patience,
your time and your advice!

484
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:31,000
So, you
refuse to eat?

485
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:36,000
Now you look so unhealthy.
You need some blusher.

486
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
You're as pretty as ever.

487
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
I hope Miranda didn't
bore you with Andalusia.

488
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:10,000
I was in Egypt.

489
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
I have a surprise for you.

490
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:14,100
Look!

491
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:16,000
Meet Patmosis,

492
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:19,100
personal physician of Ramses II,
the great pharaoh.

493
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,100
Medically, they
were so advanced.

494
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,200
Their preservation
techniques prove it.

495
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,100
Nobody's ever done better.

496
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,900
I'm sure with all his secrets,

497
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,100
he'll soon have you
on your feet.

498
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,100
As soon as I find the
man who can revive him.

499
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:53,100
Sir?

500
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:59,000
I'm very sorry,
Miss Blanc-Sec.

501
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:02,000
I was about to
slip you a note.

502
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
I'd no idea you were back.

503
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
I was about to go out.

504
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:07,000
I won't keep you.

505
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:08,100
I hope not.

506
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Here...

507
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:13,200
Number them, so I
know where to begin.

508
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:16,100
Forget the others. I mean,

509
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:19,200
you can read them later.
That one's the most important.

510
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Ok, I will read them in bath.

511
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:23,100
In bath?

512
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
I always do.

513
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Urn.

514
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:36,000
Beautiful.

515
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:37,200
What?

516
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,900
I mean, your room is beautifully
decorated.

517
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:41,000
What's this pterodactyl?

518
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:44,000
Exactly. That's what my...

519
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Which prison has a death row?

520
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:48,000
La Same.

521
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:58,200
Can I do something to help?

522
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:00,000
Drink to my health!

523
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:20,000
Esperandieu,
your lawyer to see you.

524
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:24,100
Your client, sir.

525
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Miss Blanc-Sec?

526
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:43,200
What are you doing here?

527
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,100
Professor, I found Patmosis' mummy,

528
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:47,200
That's impossible.

529
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:50,000
True, but I did.
And don't ask me how.

530
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:51,100
Where is it now?

531
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:53,000
At home.

532
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Waiting for you.

533
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:55,100
Oh.

534
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:58,100
But Adele...

535
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:00,100
I fear it will have
to wait some more.

536
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:03,100
I don't see how I
can get out of here.

537
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:07,100
Anyway, my mind is too busy
controlling the bird.

538
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:09,000
The pterodactyl?

539
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:11,100
Yes. I wanted to refine
my technique

540
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:13,200
while you were in Egypt.

541
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:19,000
I brought to life an egg
over 135 million years old.

542
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:23,000
Perfect! A 4,000-year-old
mummy will be child's play.

543
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Perhaps,

544
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,200
but the bird exhausts me.

545
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,200
Whenever I doze off, its killer
instinct takes over. I must stop it

546
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,200
My sister first,
then your giant insect.

547
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,000
That's fine by me,
but how will you get me out?

548
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:40,000
Trust your lawyer.

549
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:42,200
Sir?

550
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:45,000
I'm here to see my
client, Esperandieu.

551
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:02,100
Mr. Saint Hubert,
can we have a comment?

552
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:06,100
Don't crowd.

553
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:10,100
Hold back the reporters!

554
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:16,900
Gentlemen, calm down!
Let him speak!

555
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:19,200
I cut short my African trip

556
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:21,100
at the government's behest.

557
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:26,100
They have invited me as an
expert to assist Mr Caponi

558
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:28,200
to dispatch this pterodactyl.

559
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:32,000
It's a great honour to put my talent
at the service of the nation.

560
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:34,200
Mr. Saint Hubert,
what approach will you use?

561
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
First, we'll track it down,

562
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:40,000
to study its
behaviour and habits.

563
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,100
How will you find it?

564
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Quite simply,
by raising our sights.

565
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:01,000
Anything good today?

566
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:01,900
Pigeon.

567
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,100
You've saved my life.

568
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:18,100
Don't mention it.

569
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:20,100
Come out, wherever you are.

570
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:29,100
It's right here, Caponi.
I can sense it.

571
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:30,000
Wonderful.

572
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:52,000
it's pter.-.ptero... pterodactyl...

573
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:00,100
What is it exactly?

574
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,900
Mutton! That's what it is.

575
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:04,000
Really?

576
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:05,900
Categorically. Trust me,

577
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:07,100
I know my droppings.

578
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:10,000
It's the best
way to track an animal.

579
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:12,900
We're making progress,
Caponi. Progress!

580
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:15,200
Wonderful.

581
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:38,200
In the bowl,
there's a badge.

582
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:40,900
You're Armand
Petit-Blanchard, head cook.

583
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:42,900
Arm and what?

584
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,200
Petit-Blanchard, I said!

585
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Someone stole my badge
from my locker.

586
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:52,000
Hands off me!

587
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:53,100
Get out! That's enough now!

588
00:47:57,100 --> 00:47:59,100
Right... I need a better plan.

589
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:05,000
Sorry, no more pate.

590
00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:07,000
Not to worry.

591
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,200
Hey! Caponi!

592
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:10,200
Yes?

593
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:14,200
Unless I'm mistaken,
it could find sheep in 3 places.

594
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:18,000
Montmartre in the north, the
colonial exhibition in the east,

595
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
or the Botanical Gardens.

596
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:24,100
That's right.

597
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:27,000
Let's go!
By the grace of God!

598
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,100
Thank you, my son.

599
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:47,000
Wow! Sister is coming.

600
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:52,000
Don't touch!
Hurry up, let's go!

601
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:03,000
As Daddy would say,

602
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:05,000
a battle that seems lost
is the most exciting.

603
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:06,900
Up and at 'em!

604
00:49:11,100 --> 00:49:13,100
Bang! Bang!

605
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:20,000
Bang!

606
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:26,200
The farmer's counted the
herd twice. None missing.

607
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:27,900
Fine! Let's go!

608
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:31,000
My sheep!

609
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:34,000
I'm so sorry. It just went off.

610
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:38,000
Bertrand? Get a vet.

611
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:44,000
Cell 28. It's for his jab.

612
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:55,900
Ouch!

613
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:57,100
Sorry.

614
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:08,000
Professor? Wake up!

615
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:11,000
It's time to go.

616
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:16,100
Would you be so kind as
to come back later?

617
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:18,000
I really am very tired.

618
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
That takes the biscuit!

619
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:33,900
Six Poitou goats,

620
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,000
four Vanoise chamois,

621
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:37,000
fifteen Larzac ewes and...

622
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:40,100
nine, ten, twelve
mountain sheep from Jura.

623
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:41,000
Jura?

624
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:43,100
All present and correct!

625
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:45,100
Good. On to the Botanical Gardens.

626
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:47,000
Get ready, Caponi!

627
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:48,100
We'll launch our assault

628
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:50,100
at first light.

629
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:51,200
Thank you!

630
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:02,900
You're relieved!

631
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:05,100
Fine by me.

632
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:11,200
Good luck!

633
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,000
I hope you had a good sleep.
We have to go now.

634
00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:33,000
What are you doing here?

635
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:34,900
It's not by choice.

636
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:37,000
Where's the Professor?

637
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:41,100
They transferred him last night.
Always do before the execution.

638
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,000
Execution?

639
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:45,100
The guillotine,
tomorrow at dawn.

640
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:46,200
It can't be...

641
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:51,000
Unfortunately, it can, unless...
he gets a pardon.

642
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:52,100
Pardon?

643
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:53,100
Yes.

644
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,200
Here... I pardon you.

645
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:15,100
Go on, fetch! Good boy, Nelson!

646
00:52:16,100 --> 00:52:19,000
Mr. President,
Miss Blanc-See's here.

647
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:24,000
She has nothing on her.

648
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:26,000
What? Nothing on het?

649
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:29,000
We searched her.
She's unarmed.

650
00:52:33,100 --> 00:52:34,000
Go on!

651
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:38,200
Come on, Nelson! Good boy!

652
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:44,000
My dear Miss Blanc-Sec!

653
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,100
Mr. President.

654
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,000
You know I have a fond

655
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:48,100
memory of that interview...

656
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:50,100
When was it?

657
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:51,200
January 18th, 1906.

658
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:51,100
The day after you
were elected.

659
00:52:54,100 --> 00:52:55,100
It was my first interview.

660
00:52:56,100 --> 00:52:59,000
And the last time I
laughed so much.

661
00:53:00,100 --> 00:53:01,100
Yes, I was appalling.

662
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:04,200
You were charming.

663
00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:06,200
So, what can I do for you?

664
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:11,100
Well... As President, you often
criticise the death penalty.

665
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:15,100
I've pardoned 17 condemned
men in my first term.

666
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:19,000
Precisely.
Please, pardon one more.

667
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:21,000
Professor Esperandieu.

668
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:23,100
Due for execution tomorrow.

669
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:24,100
He's innocent.

670
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:26,100
I know his case.
We have 3 dead bodies,

671
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:28,200
including a Prefect.

672
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:31,100
He didn't kill them.
It was a prehistoric beast!

673
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,100
Only the Professor
can control it.

674
00:53:34,100 --> 00:53:35,200
Without him,

675
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:36,200
how many bodies
will there be?

676
00:53:37,100 --> 00:53:38,000
Miss,

677
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:40,200
we have put our
finest men on the case.

678
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:44,100
We even called in a big game
hunter from Africa

679
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:46,000
to dispatch the animal.

680
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:50,100
Nelson! Fetch your ball!

681
00:53:51,100 --> 00:53:54,100
Esperandieu is a fine scholar.

682
00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:57,100
His research keeps
science going forward.

683
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:04,000
By taking his life, you
condemn so many others.

684
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:09,000
I promise I'll think it over.

685
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:11,100
Thank you, sir.

686
00:54:11,100 --> 00:54:13,100
What's wrong?
Your ball's over there!

687
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:15,100
Fetch it, Nelson!

688
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:17,200
Come on! Look!

689
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
What's up? Seen a ghost?

690
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:26,200
See? Your ball's over here.

691
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:31,100
Come and fetch it!
Be a good boy! Hurry!

692
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:39,200
Come! Nelson! Come!

693
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:43,200
Oh, no! Mr. President!

694
00:54:47,100 --> 00:54:48,900
Good boy! Into my arms!

695
00:54:49,100 --> 00:54:50,100
Get down!

696
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:56,000
President assaulted!
Sorry!

697
00:54:56,100 --> 00:54:57,000
Don't move!

698
00:54:57,100 --> 00:54:58,100
Get off him!

699
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,200
Take your paws
off me! Let me go!

700
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,100
Are you hurt, sir?

701
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:04,100
I am fine, go away!

702
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:06,200
I'm warning you,
I do jiu-jitsu.

703
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:09,200
Nelson! Nelson!
Let me go or I'll press charges!

704
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:11,100
Nelson!

705
00:55:13,100 --> 00:55:14,200
Nelson!

706
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:18,000
Find Nelson!

707
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,000
Eyes open, Caponi!

708
00:55:44,100 --> 00:55:45,100
Both are wide open, honestly.

709
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
Vigilance and patience are the
hunter's watchwords.

710
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:55,200
Tell me, Saint Hubert, could
I nip off for a minute

711
00:55:56,100 --> 00:55:57,100
for some food?

712
00:55:58,100 --> 00:56:00,900
Out of the question!
We are at war, my friend.

713
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:06,900
One day I hunted a tiger lying
low in a Bengali temple.

714
00:56:07,300 --> 00:56:10,000
We went three days
without food.

715
00:56:11,100 --> 00:56:12,200
Three days!

716
00:56:15,100 --> 00:56:16,100
Yes.

717
00:56:37,100 --> 00:56:39,100
Incredible!
How did you do it?

718
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:42,900
I started by consulting all
the books in the library,

719
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
which confirmed the animal's

720
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:47,000
sedentary nature.

721
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:48,200
So I got the idea to collect

722
00:56:49,100 --> 00:56:51,100
the fragments of its egg

723
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:53,000
and put them in a quiet place.

724
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:55,100
Then I left out some

725
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,200
choice cuts of beef,

726
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:58,200
to keep them from hunger,

727
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,900
so it wouldn't decimate
our herd of Corsican sheep.

728
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:05,200
Zborowsky... You're a genius!

729
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:09,100
It's nothing really.
Just a little intuition.

730
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:12,000
With intuition like that,

731
00:57:12,100 --> 00:57:15,000
you must sweep the ladies off
their feet, my young friend!

732
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:18,100
That depends on the lady.

733
00:57:21,300 --> 00:57:24,100
Are there two L's in Addle?

734
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:26,000
No, two E's.

735
00:57:26,100 --> 00:57:28,000
Two E's?

736
00:57:28,100 --> 00:57:32,100
Adele. A-D-E-L-E. Blanc-Sec.
Like the wine. Dry white, you know.

737
00:57:33,100 --> 00:57:35,100
Yes, I know dry whites.

738
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:36,200
Marvellous!

739
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:39,200
Go ahead.
From the beginning.

740
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:41,000
To cure my sister,

741
00:57:41,100 --> 00:57:42,200
I went to Egypt, not Peru,

742
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:44,000
to find a doctor, Patmosis,

743
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:47,000
a charming but
mummified fellow.

744
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
Prof. Esperandieu
was supposed to wake him,

745
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:50,200
not the damn pterodactyl
he should've left alone,

746
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:54,100
given its attack on
the President and his pet.

747
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:57,100
The petero...

748
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:58,200
No, the pet's the dog.

749
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:03,200
I summoned up all my courage
and threw myself on the President.

750
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:06,100
A heroic but calculated gesture,

751
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:07,200
intended to secure a pardon for

752
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,000
the Professor to save my sister

753
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:11,000
I was arrested for
attacking him.

754
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
Do I look like a terrorist?

755
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,000
No.

756
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,100
So the bird dunked on Nelson.

757
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:21,200
Dunked?

758
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:23,200
Clear? Can I go home now?

759
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:29,100
Yes. However...
One tiny detail escapes me.

760
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:30,200
Which is?

761
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:37,000
Who is... Whose is...
Whose is the dog?

762
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:43,100
Right... Do you have
to speak in Morse,

763
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:44,200
or we'll be all night?

764
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,100
I save the President and
that's the thanks I get?

765
00:58:52,100 --> 00:58:53,000
You louts!

766
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:57,000
Things didn't quite
go to plan, little sis.

767
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:08,000
I need a bath to
gather my wits.

768
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:53,000
Sorry for bothering
you for nothing.

769
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:20,000
Truly. But aren't you happier here
eyeing the girls than in your tomb?

770
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:32,200
My God!

771
01:01:42,100 --> 01:01:43,000
Yes?

772
01:01:43,100 --> 01:01:44,000
Into my arms!

773
01:01:45,100 --> 01:01:46,100
I read your letter.

774
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:47,900
Which one?

775
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
About the pterodactyl.
You're a genius, Andrej.

776
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:55,100
Let's go. The taxi's
waiting downstairs.

777
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:57,200
Right away.

778
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:00,000
This way.

779
01:02:07,100 --> 01:02:09,000
See? I wasn't telling you lies.

780
01:02:12,100 --> 01:02:13,100
Incredible!

781
01:02:19,100 --> 01:02:20,200
Be careful, Miss Adele.

782
01:02:21,100 --> 01:02:24,100
Don't worry, I've
cracked tougher nuts.

783
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:31,100
Birdy, birdy...

784
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:35,000
It prefers meat.

785
01:02:35,100 --> 01:02:36,000
Really?

786
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:41,100
Silly me.

787
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:48,100
Where are you from, my beauty?

788
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:51,200
I don't mean you!

789
01:02:55,100 --> 01:02:58,200
In any case, you
have beautiful plumage.

790
01:02:59,100 --> 01:03:04,000
In truth, if your voice is the
equal of your coat...

791
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:11,900
Fine. Clearly no ancestor
of the nightingale.

792
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:15,200
Watch out, it might
think you're a goat.

793
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:20,100
You smooth-talker.

794
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:21,200
No, I meant...

795
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
I'm usually called bird names.

796
01:03:24,100 --> 01:03:25,000
Really?

797
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:31,000
My dove... My chickadee...

798
01:03:33,100 --> 01:03:35,100
My feathery thing!

799
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:42,000
Actually...

800
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
You want my
feathers, don't you?

801
01:03:48,200 --> 01:04:02,000
My feathery thing...
Feathers of little birdies...

802
01:04:02,100 --> 01:04:03,000
Incredible!

803
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:09,100
There you go, that's
good. Now we're friends,

804
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:11,100
I have a favour
to ask of you.

805
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:13,200
Surely you're not going to...

806
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:15,000
It'd be rude not to.

807
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:31,000
It's madness!

808
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:34,200
It can't be more
complicated than a camel.

809
01:04:35,100 --> 01:04:36,200
It can.

810
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:50,100
Watch out! The tree!

811
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:03,200
Stop!

812
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:06,100
There we are.

813
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:08,200
You're unbelievable,
Miss Blanc-Sec.

814
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,200
Now we've mastered the unbelievable,
let's perform the impossible.

815
01:05:36,100 --> 01:05:37,100
Here we are!

816
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:50,200
This way, my friends.

817
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:52,100
This is so exciting!

818
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:54,200
You haven't seen anything yet.

819
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,200
And don't blink,
or you'll miss it.

820
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:15,900
I prepared some snacks for you.

821
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
Good thinking.
This is for you.

822
01:06:18,100 --> 01:06:19,000
Thank you.

823
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,100
Champagne? I'll be tipsy again.
Which way?

824
01:06:21,100 --> 01:06:22,000
At the window.

825
01:06:22,100 --> 01:06:23,000
Thank you.

826
01:06:26,100 --> 01:06:28,200
Look at the crowd.
We're Justin time.

827
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:42,100
There he is!
An ugly little head he has.

828
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:44,100
I see why they'd chop it off.

829
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:46,100
Charlotte!

830
01:06:48,100 --> 01:06:55,000
It was because of the egg.
It was too much for him.

831
01:06:57,100 --> 01:06:59,000
They've put a bag on his head.

832
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:20,000
I don't understand. Why'd the executioner
fly off with a bag on his head?

833
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:32,000
There! There it is!

834
01:07:32,100 --> 01:07:33,000
There! I'm here!

835
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:36,200
It's snatched a man. Fetch an ambulance.
Leave the rest to me.

836
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:40,200
I'll go right away.

837
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:11,100
You keep it, buster.
You've earned it.

838
01:08:13,900 --> 01:08:20,000
Anyone there! Where are we?
Is this hell?

839
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:21,900
Here I am!

840
01:08:22,100 --> 01:08:23,100
Adele?

841
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:25,100
Hello.

842
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:27,000
How can this be?

843
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:32,000
He saved your life. You brought
him to life, so it's only fair.

844
01:08:32,100 --> 01:08:33,000
Yes.

845
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:36,100
What's going on? Who are these...

846
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:38,200
Esperandieu?

847
01:08:38,200 --> 01:08:40,000
Menard!

848
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:42,100
By the saints! A miracle!

849
01:08:42,100 --> 01:08:44,100
Menard, you old blackguard!

850
01:08:44,100 --> 01:08:46,100
Esperandieu, well I never!

851
01:08:52,100 --> 01:08:53,100
How on earth did
you get here?

852
01:08:53,200 --> 01:08:55,900
That's a very long story.

853
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:57,100
You can tell it later.
This winter,

854
01:08:57,300 --> 01:08:59,200
over a hot chocolate.

855
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,100
We have a mummy to
wake and sister to save.

856
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:04,000
Just joking!

857
01:09:04,100 --> 01:09:05,100
Yes, she's just joking.

858
01:09:05,200 --> 01:09:06,900
Well, I'm not joking.

859
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:09,000
Tired after your trip?

860
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,100
Indeed I am. Very tired.

861
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:13,000
Want to go home?

862
01:09:13,100 --> 01:09:15,000
Yes. I should be going home.

863
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:16,100
I'll take you.

864
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:17,000
Yes, take us home.

865
01:09:18,100 --> 01:09:22,900
Sure, take him home.
Goodbye, ducky!

866
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:25,100
What's that...

867
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:42,000
Saint Hubert?

868
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:46,200
Esperandieu!

869
01:09:48,100 --> 01:09:49,100
Not now!

870
01:09:49,200 --> 01:09:50,100
What's wrong?

871
01:09:55,200 --> 01:09:56,200
Saint Hubert.

872
01:10:00,100 --> 01:10:01,100
Get out!

873
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:04,100
Stupid hound!

874
01:10:04,300 --> 01:10:08,000
You worthless nincompoop, who
allowed you to shoot at science?

875
01:10:09,200 --> 01:10:14,000
I am Justin de Saint Hubert,
big game hunter...

876
01:10:14,100 --> 01:10:15,100
Big game hunter?

877
01:10:16,100 --> 01:10:17,200
I'm a hunter, too,

878
01:10:17,200 --> 01:10:19,100
but I only shoot black sheep.

879
01:10:19,200 --> 01:10:21,200
You seem a fine specimen.

880
01:10:21,200 --> 01:10:22,900
Stop that! You've no right!

881
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:24,100
One!
No!

882
01:10:24,100 --> 01:10:25,200
Two!
No!

883
01:10:25,200 --> 01:10:27,000
Three!
No!

884
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,200
Four! Five!
No! No! No!

885
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:32,900
Don't die now, please!

886
01:10:33,100 --> 01:10:34,100
I'll do my best.

887
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:36,000
Let me help.

888
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:39,100
If you want to help,
look after the pterodactyl.

889
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:40,100
But the Professor's bleeding.

890
01:10:40,200 --> 01:10:44,000
They're connected!
Don't ask how or why.

891
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,200
If we lose one, we lose both.
Don't let it happen.

892
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:50,200
Yes, of course!
Leave it to me.

893
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,000
Twenty-eight, Rue du Four.

894
01:11:02,100 --> 01:11:03,100
What do I do now?

895
01:11:03,200 --> 01:11:06,100
Place antique objects
in a circle around me.

896
01:11:12,300 --> 01:11:15,000
The older the better.

897
01:11:12,300 --> 01:11:14,200
Yes, that one.

898
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:51,000
I'm going to need to...
put this bandage on you.

899
01:11:54,200 --> 01:11:56,200
I'll be fight back.

900
01:12:01,100 --> 01:12:02,200
There! What now?

901
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:08,200
Now... I'll try to establish
contact with the mummy

902
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:12,200
to see if it agrees to
entrust the keys to me.

903
01:12:13,300 --> 01:12:14,200
Excellent!

904
01:12:16,100 --> 01:12:17,200
What keys?

905
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:21,900
After death, the
whole body shrinks

906
01:12:22,200 --> 01:12:26,200
and locks itself in the mind
which never die.

907
01:12:26,200 --> 01:12:32,200
I discovered the key to
communicate with the mind.

908
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:34,000
Wonderful!

909
01:13:14,200 --> 01:13:15,200
It's going to work.

910
01:13:35,100 --> 01:13:45,000
Maybe... some procoagulants...
in a nub... of butter?

911
01:13:55,200 --> 01:14:00,200
Professor!

912
01:14:00,300 --> 01:14:06,200
Please, stay with me. Please,
just a little longer!

913
01:15:14,100 --> 01:15:15,200
Bless you.

914
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:20,200
Thanks.

915
01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:31,100
Sorry about the glass.

916
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:35,000
Forget it. I have
to tidy up anyway.

917
01:15:44,200 --> 01:15:48,000
What a shame he's gone. I'd have
liked to get to know him.

918
01:15:54,200 --> 01:15:59,000
What have we here? I detect
a certain likeness.

919
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:01,000
She's my sister.

920
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:05,000
She doesn't look well.

921
01:16:05,200 --> 01:16:06,100
Yes...

922
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:10,000
But...

923
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:12,000
Actually...

924
01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:16,100
With the knowledge you possess,
perhaps you could try

925
01:16:17,100 --> 01:16:19,200
to bring her back to life?

926
01:16:20,200 --> 01:16:22,000
I have some modest talents,

927
01:16:22,100 --> 01:16:23,900
but not that one.

928
01:16:25,100 --> 01:16:27,200
What? You're not a doctor?

929
01:16:28,200 --> 01:16:31,100
Absolutely not.
I'm a nuclear physicist.

930
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:35,900
I deal in figures, signs and
equations. Nothing very extraordinary.

931
01:16:36,200 --> 01:16:39,000
Doctors don't leave
the pharaoh's side,

932
01:16:39,200 --> 01:16:43,100
and are buried next to them,
right next door.

933
01:16:46,100 --> 01:16:48,000
May I make some tea?

934
01:16:48,100 --> 01:16:49,000
Be my guest.

935
01:16:49,100 --> 01:16:52,200
Very kind of you.

936
01:16:52,200 --> 01:16:54,200
Kindness is a highly prized
quality in our dynasty.

937
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,100
I admit that throughout
this adventure,

938
01:17:00,200 --> 01:17:05,200
you have been very hospitable towards
me, and I'd like to thank you.

939
01:17:06,100 --> 01:17:07,100
You could hear?

940
01:17:07,100 --> 01:17:08,100
Everything.

941
01:17:09,200 --> 01:17:11,000
And see? Like when I...

942
01:17:13,200 --> 01:17:14,200
Everything.

943
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:21,100
Don't blush. With this body, you
appreciate that of others more.

944
01:17:21,200 --> 01:17:22,200
Thanks.

945
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:28,200
I suppose you want a doctor
to cure this poor child.

946
01:17:30,200 --> 01:17:33,200
Yes. Not only is
she my sister,

947
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:37,200
but also my friend,
my angel... My twin.

948
01:17:42,100 --> 01:17:44,000
What happened to her?

949
01:17:45,200 --> 01:17:47,000
A freak accident.

950
01:17:48,100 --> 01:17:49,100
A camel?

951
01:17:49,200 --> 01:17:52,200
Tennis.

952
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:01,200
Lend me your hatpin.
No way!

953
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:01,000
Thanks.
For nothing.

954
01:18:03,100 --> 01:18:04,000
How do I look?

955
01:18:04,100 --> 01:18:05,100
Like skewered kidneys.

956
01:18:05,200 --> 01:18:08,200
Which I take to mean...
"Gracious!

957
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:12,900
Why did my parents give her beauty and
leave me only bitterness and jealousy?"

958
01:18:14,200 --> 01:18:19,100
One game all. New balls.

959
01:18:21,300 --> 01:18:24,200
We'd just turned twenty.

960
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:26,200
Agathe was so beautiful.

961
01:18:28,200 --> 01:18:30,000
We'd discovered a new sport
and played whenever we could.

962
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:35,000
In order to avoid
any sense of rivalry,

963
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,100
we never had an actual match.

964
01:18:38,100 --> 01:18:39,200
Our games were
strictly friend lies.

965
01:19:20,200 --> 01:19:24,000
Then, in a moment of euphoria,
a moment of shared happiness,

966
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:26,000
tragedy struck.

967
01:19:44,200 --> 01:19:47,000
Agathe!

968
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:50,100
Miss, are you okay?

969
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:52,900
Miss, wake up!

970
01:19:53,100 --> 01:19:59,100
Move! Please!
Agathe! Move!

971
01:19:59,200 --> 01:20:02,200
No, not that!

972
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:06,200
Sorry! Stay with me!
Go and fetch a doctor!

973
01:20:07,100 --> 01:20:14,000
Agathe! Agathe!
Agathe! Agathe! Agathe!

974
01:20:36,100 --> 01:20:39,100
She was born a
few minutes after me

975
01:20:40,200 --> 01:20:46,100
but she departed well before melt's
the only race I'd have loved to lose.

976
01:20:53,100 --> 01:20:55,000
Indeed, a most
regrettable accident.

977
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:59,000
Believe me, I'm very
sorry I can't help you.

978
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:03,000
The Professor did a remarkable
job. His mental power

979
01:21:03,100 --> 01:21:05,200
must have woken the
dead in a radius of 2 km.

980
01:21:06,100 --> 01:21:08,100
But I'm not the right person.

981
01:21:11,100 --> 01:21:14,100
Hold on a sec... 2 kilometres?

982
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:16,100
Yes, probably.

983
01:21:17,100 --> 01:21:20,200
The waves ripple out like when
you throw a stone into water.

984
01:21:21,100 --> 01:21:23,100
And Ramses' doctors
never left his side?

985
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:27,000
They never left the room, even when he
was mating. The Mummies of Ramses II.

986
01:21:38,100 --> 01:21:40,100
Patmosis, you're a genius.

987
01:21:41,200 --> 01:21:42,200
Let's go!

988
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,100
Excuse me, I'm looking for
the Ramses exhibition.

989
01:22:01,200 --> 01:22:02,100
Yes, quite!

990
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,200
Stop importuning people.
You'll get us noticed.

991
01:22:11,100 --> 01:22:14,900
After 5,000 years in a tomb,
can't I have some fun?

992
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
I couldn't resist.
It was rather amusing.

993
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,000
First things first.
Then you can die.

994
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:20,200
Of laughing, if you wish.

995
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:35,200
Can you open it?

996
01:22:36,100 --> 01:22:38,100
I'm no better
locksmith than doctor.

997
01:22:38,200 --> 01:22:42,000
Perhaps you could serve some kind of
purpose, or I'll float you down the Seine.

998
01:22:42,100 --> 01:22:44,000
The Nile, it ain't!

999
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:47,000
Don't get upset. Humour soothes
the savage breast.

1000
01:22:47,100 --> 01:22:49,000
That's not humour!

1001
01:22:49,200 --> 01:22:52,100
Maybe it made
the pharaohs laugh,

1002
01:22:52,200 --> 01:22:53,900
but this is the 20th century!

1003
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:07,000
That's better.

1004
01:23:23,300 --> 01:23:25,000
This way, Mistress.

1005
01:23:37,100 --> 01:23:38,100
Pattnosis!

1006
01:23:37,100 --> 01:23:39,100
Yes, Mistress.

1007
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:50,100
Coming, Mistress!
This way, Mistress.

1008
01:23:50,200 --> 01:23:52,000
Cut it out!

1009
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,100
You're very tense. Relax.

1010
01:23:54,300 --> 01:23:56,100
I'll give you a massage later.

1011
01:23:56,200 --> 01:23:57,100
You're a chiropractor now?

1012
01:23:57,200 --> 01:24:00,200
No, but I studied
molecular energy.

1013
01:24:00,200 --> 01:24:02,000
For now, stick
to opening doors.

1014
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:12,200
Beautiful, eh? Reminds me
of when we painted.

1015
01:24:15,100 --> 01:24:16,100
All clear?

1016
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:19,000
Look, what's that?

1017
01:24:19,100 --> 01:24:20,000
what?

1018
01:24:20,200 --> 01:24:21,900
Pattnosis!

1019
01:24:22,100 --> 01:24:23,100
Leave it to me, Mistress.

1020
01:24:24,100 --> 01:24:26,100
Miss!

1021
01:24:33,200 --> 01:24:36,200
Waking people, no, but knocking
them out, no problem.

1022
01:24:37,200 --> 01:24:38,200
Thank you, Mistress.

1023
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:45,000
Oh my God!

1024
01:24:45,100 --> 01:24:47,000
They're all jumbled up.

1025
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,000
If Ramses saw this...

1026
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:50,200
Wake him, so he can
rearrange them.

1027
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:54,100
The faithful first, so they're
there when the Pharaoh wakes.

1028
01:24:56,100 --> 01:24:58,100
Poor dear, don't want
him feeling homesick.

1029
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:03,000
And definitely not insulted, so
I suggest we respect protocol.

1030
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:06,000
I'm in favour of protocol.

1031
01:25:10,200 --> 01:25:13,000
Sorry to bother you,
are you a doctor?

1032
01:25:17,100 --> 01:25:19,000
Are you a surgeon?

1033
01:25:23,100 --> 01:25:24,200
I'm looking for a doctor.

1034
01:25:26,100 --> 01:25:29,000
No, you're not a doctor!

1035
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
Doctor anyone?

1036
01:26:01,200 --> 01:26:09,000
Great nap. What is that
ridiculous attire?

1037
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:12,000
Native costume,
Your Highness.

1038
01:26:12,100 --> 01:26:14,200
Allow me to introduce
Miss Adele Blanc-Sec, a scribe.

1039
01:26:16,100 --> 01:26:17,000
Hi.

1040
01:26:18,100 --> 01:26:21,000
The natives employ women
to write their texts?

1041
01:26:21,200 --> 01:26:24,100
Their civilization is
still rough and ready,

1042
01:26:24,200 --> 01:26:26,000
but she is very amicable

1043
01:26:26,100 --> 01:26:28,100
and waking us was
her good idea.

1044
01:26:28,200 --> 01:26:32,100
Good idea? I feel I've
woken up a little early.

1045
01:26:32,200 --> 01:26:37,100
Sorry to wake you, Your Highness, I had no
choice. It's a matter of life or death.

1046
01:26:37,200 --> 01:26:42,000
Life or death?
It comes and it goes.

1047
01:26:42,100 --> 01:26:43,200
I'd like my
sister's to come back.

1048
01:26:44,200 --> 01:26:49,000
Miss Adele woke me up in the
belief that I was a doctor.

1049
01:26:49,200 --> 01:26:51,100
You? A doctor?

1050
01:26:52,100 --> 01:26:54,100
I wouldn't let you
clip my nails.

1051
01:26:54,200 --> 01:26:56,200
She's looking for a doctor
to treat her sister,

1052
01:26:57,100 --> 01:26:59,000
and we thought that

1053
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:00,100
in your great kindness,

1054
01:27:00,200 --> 01:27:04,100
you might let your personal
physician take a look at the child.

1055
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,200
You woke me up for
such a trivial affair?

1056
01:27:14,100 --> 01:27:18,200
Hold on, Rammy! Five thousand years,
you've been snoring away.

1057
01:27:19,200 --> 01:27:23,000
I've had 5 years of grieving,

1058
01:27:23,100 --> 01:27:24,200
of suffering with my
sister who can't see me.

1059
01:27:25,200 --> 01:27:29,000
I'm a poor earth-dweller
with no divine protection.

1060
01:27:29,100 --> 01:27:35,900
I live everyday with the pain
and guilt that never goes away.

1061
01:27:37,200 --> 01:27:40,200
Because it was all my fault!
It was my hatpin!

1062
01:27:44,100 --> 01:27:45,200
What's this about a hat?

1063
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
Nothing, I'll tell you later.

1064
01:27:54,100 --> 01:27:59,200
Nosibis, my faithful doctor...

1065
01:28:01,100 --> 01:28:03,200
See if you can give the
girl a little life back,

1066
01:28:04,100 --> 01:28:07,000
so she can enjoy
all this love for her.

1067
01:28:08,100 --> 01:28:09,000
Thank you...

1068
01:28:10,200 --> 01:28:12,000
Your Highness.

1069
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:16,100
Serene Majesty?

1070
01:28:34,100 --> 01:28:37,200
The doctors said if we took
it out, she'd most likely die.

1071
01:28:41,200 --> 01:28:44,100
You're insane!
I asked you to cure her,

1072
01:28:44,100 --> 01:28:46,100
not kill her,
you bag of bones!

1073
01:28:46,200 --> 01:28:48,100
Calm down, Adele.
Don't interfere.

1074
01:29:35,200 --> 01:29:36,900
What's that?

1075
01:29:37,200 --> 01:29:38,200
The Pharaoh's entrails.

1076
01:29:39,100 --> 01:29:40,200
Charming.

1077
01:30:35,200 --> 01:30:36,200
Is the kiss necessary?

1078
01:30:37,100 --> 01:30:39,000
Not really,
more of a tradition.

1079
01:30:39,100 --> 01:30:42,200
It's better to do it now,
before she wakes up.

1080
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:44,100
No kidding.

1081
01:30:46,200 --> 01:30:50,100
Well... Let's go out
and see the sights.

1082
01:31:00,100 --> 01:31:01,000
Agathe!

1083
01:31:02,200 --> 01:31:03,200
Agathe!

1084
01:31:07,200 --> 01:31:08,200
Agathe!

1085
01:31:12,200 --> 01:31:15,200
Are you mad, hitting
the ball like that?

1086
01:31:19,100 --> 01:31:22,000
And I love you more
than the whole world.

1087
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,200
It was a privilege
meeting you, Miss Adele.

1088
01:31:30,100 --> 01:31:31,100
Same here, Patmosis.

1089
01:31:32,100 --> 01:31:33,200
Apologize to your Pharaoh for me,
for being so rude.

1090
01:31:32,100 --> 01:31:37,800
And thank him for me.

1091
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:40,100
I will... Mistress.

1092
01:31:43,200 --> 01:31:45,200
Who are you talking to?

1093
01:31:46,300 --> 01:31:52,200
Nobody, darling. Don't move. Everything
will be fine now, I promise.

1094
01:32:02,200 --> 01:32:04,000
This way, Your Majesty.

1095
01:32:15,100 --> 01:32:16,200
What was that?

1096
01:32:27,100 --> 01:32:29,200
Sorry to importune you again.

1097
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:31,000
Go ahead.

1098
01:32:31,100 --> 01:32:33,200
Which way to the Nile, please?

1099
01:32:33,200 --> 01:32:35,000
Why, of course!

1100
01:32:39,100 --> 01:32:43,000
They are very curious people.
Cruelly lacking in manners.

1101
01:32:43,100 --> 01:32:45,000
I agree, Your Highness.

1102
01:32:45,200 --> 01:32:49,000
But they have highly developed
artistic talents.

1103
01:32:51,200 --> 01:32:55,200
This courtyard, for example,
is magnificent.

1104
01:32:55,200 --> 01:32:56,200
Quite magnificent!

1105
01:32:56,200 --> 01:32:59,000
We should build
a pyramid here.

1106
01:32:59,200 --> 01:33:01,200
I'm sure it would be
a fine addition.

1107
01:33:02,200 --> 01:33:05,200
Meanwhile, Sire, perhaps
we should rejoin the others?

1108
01:33:06,200 --> 01:33:08,200
You are right,
Patmosis. Let's go!

1109
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,200
Curse of the Pharaohs
Strikes Paris!

1110
01:33:29,200 --> 01:33:33,100
Read all about it! Mummies
Vanish from the Louvre!

1111
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:35,000
There you go, sir!

1112
01:33:35,200 --> 01:33:39,000
Curse of the Pharaohs
Strikes Paris!

1113
01:33:43,200 --> 01:33:45,000
What's this now
about mummies?

1114
01:33:46,200 --> 01:33:51,000
It's another anarchist plot.
Call the Interior.

1115
01:33:57,200 --> 01:33:59,200
Tuck in, my little Caponi!

1116
01:34:35,200 --> 01:34:36,200
Who's it for?

1117
01:34:38,200 --> 01:34:39,200
It was for Miss Adele.

1118
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
She's taken a
few weeks' vacation.

1119
01:34:42,200 --> 01:34:43,100
Well.

1120
01:34:44,100 --> 01:34:45,200
Give them to someone else.

1121
01:34:53,100 --> 01:34:58,900
For me? That's so kind!
What's your name?

1122
01:35:01,200 --> 01:35:05,000
Zborowsky.

1123
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:06,000
First name perhaps?

1124
01:35:06,200 --> 01:35:09,200
Yes. Andrej,
with aj, as in...

1125
01:35:09,200 --> 01:35:15,000
As in jaguar.
Cup of tea?

1126
01:35:15,100 --> 01:35:16,000
Yes.

1127
01:35:26,200 --> 01:35:27,200
Enjoy the trip.

1128
01:35:27,200 --> 01:35:28,100
Thank you.

1129
01:35:33,300 --> 01:35:35,100
Hurry, miss,
we're about to leave.

1130
01:35:35,300 --> 01:35:37,100
All right,
keep your hair on.

1131
01:35:38,100 --> 01:35:39,100
Blanc-Sec, Adele.

1132
01:35:42,200 --> 01:35:43,100
Thank you.

1133
01:35:54,200 --> 01:36:00,100
The woman in the green hat?
Leave it to us.

1134
01:36:07,200 --> 01:36:11,100
Hurry up!
It is Miss Blanc-See's luggage.

1135
01:36:13,100 --> 01:36:15,000
Welcome on board.
Welcome on board.

1136
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:16,100
Hurry. Move fast
for the luggage!

1137
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:24,100
Welcome on board.
Hurry up!

1138
01:36:24,200 --> 01:36:27,100
How are you? Welcome!

1139
01:36:30,200 --> 01:36:32,200
Take this.
Miss Blanc-Sec...

1140
01:36:32,200 --> 01:36:33,100
Yes?

1141
01:36:33,100 --> 01:36:34,100
These are yours?

1142
01:36:34,100 --> 01:36:35,900
Take good care of them.

1143
01:36:40,100 --> 01:36:41,100
Sorry!

1144
01:36:41,200 --> 01:36:42,100
Good start to the holiday.

1145
01:36:43,100 --> 01:36:45,200
Sorry, it was an accident.

1146
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:47,200
That's my bag!
Take good care of it.

1147
01:36:59,200 --> 01:37:02,000
Have a good trip, Miss Blanc-Sec.

1148
01:38:53,200 --> 01:38:54,100
Saint Hubert!

1149
01:38:56,000 --> 01:39:00,100
Caponi! Caponi!

1150
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:04,200
A fine zebra!

1151
01:39:16,200 --> 01:39:20,000
I've lost Saint Hubert!
I just lost him! Go and find him!

1152
01:39:41,100 --> 01:39:43,200
You put up a good fight.

1153
01:39:44,100 --> 01:39:46,000
Please, I'm begging you.

1154
01:39:47,200 --> 01:39:48,100
No!

1155
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:49,200
Smile!

1156
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:51,100
No!

1157
01:39:54,900 --> 01:39:55,200
Nobody move!

1158
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:57,900
I'm out of ammunition.

1159
01:39:59,200 --> 01:40:00,900
Take him away!

1160
01:40:02,100 --> 01:40:04,000
You look like a
fine specimen, too.

1161
01:40:17,100 --> 01:40:22,100
Sit tight.
I'll get reinforcements.

1162
01:40:22,200 --> 01:40:23,200
Fine, take your time.

1163
01:40:42,100 --> 01:40:43,000
Oh, no!
