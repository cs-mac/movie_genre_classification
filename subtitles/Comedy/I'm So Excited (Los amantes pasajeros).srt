1
00:00:23,074 --> 00:00:25,407
Everything that happens in this film...

2
00:00:25,408 --> 00:00:27,490
is fiction and fantasy...

3
00:00:27,491 --> 00:00:29,949
and bears no relation to reality.

4
00:01:09,949 --> 00:01:14,241
I'M SO EXCITED!

5
00:02:29,241 --> 00:02:31,905
Oh, God, I'm so sorry!
Are you all right?

6
00:02:31,906 --> 00:02:34,782
Are you two OK?
What happened?

7
00:02:34,783 --> 00:02:38,240
The cases fell off
when I was trying to avoid him.

8
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:40,032
Shit! Where's my phone?

9
00:02:40,033 --> 00:02:42,699
Who looks at their phone
in the middle of the runway?

10
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:44,324
Are you crazy?

11
00:02:44,325 --> 00:02:45,285
Here, clean yourself up.

12
00:02:57,033 --> 00:02:59,782
-Are you all right, Jessi?
-I feel really queasy.

13
00:02:59,783 --> 00:03:03,324
-You don't look well.
-Recently I get queasy over nothing.

14
00:03:03,325 --> 00:03:05,407
You do?
Why didn't you say anything?

15
00:03:05,408 --> 00:03:07,283
Maybe you're pregnant.

16
00:03:09,283 --> 00:03:12,366
Jessi... Is that true?

17
00:03:14,366 --> 00:03:17,449
It's very early, Leon.
I'm only two months.

18
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:20,574
Two months?
Why didn't you tell me?

19
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:22,574
-It's the doctor's fault.
-What doctor?

20
00:03:22,575 --> 00:03:26,407
-He asked if the baby was wanted.
-Very wanted.

21
00:03:26,408 --> 00:03:29,449
That's what I told him.
I said: "We've been trying for years".

22
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:31,615
He said:
"Don't tell him yet, it's too soon".

23
00:03:31,616 --> 00:03:34,782
I said: "My husband will notice".
Didn't you notice anything?

24
00:03:34,783 --> 00:03:37,948
I noticed
that your tits were bigger, but...

25
00:03:37,949 --> 00:03:41,948
And all the eggs I eat every morning?
When did I ever eat so many eggs?

26
00:03:41,949 --> 00:03:43,657
It's true, you're eating lots of eggs.

27
00:03:43,658 --> 00:03:46,741
Do you mind if I go to the infirmary
before I bleed to death?

28
00:03:46,742 --> 00:03:49,073
Yes, let's get you to the infirmary.

29
00:03:49,074 --> 00:03:52,241
You, keep on tweeting!
And put the cases back on the truck.

30
00:03:53,241 --> 00:03:55,157
I... am...

31
00:03:55,158 --> 00:03:57,990
bleeding...

32
00:03:57,991 --> 00:04:01,366
to death!!!!

33
00:04:11,366 --> 00:04:14,407
-Request taxi.
-Peninsula 2549, ready to taxi.

34
00:04:14,408 --> 00:04:17,239
Peninsula 2549, permission to taxi.

35
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:21,283
Peninsula 2549,
permitted to taxi to holding position.

36
00:04:23,283 --> 00:04:25,907
-Right clear.
-Left clear. OK, let's go.

37
00:04:54,907 --> 00:04:56,573
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.

38
00:04:56,574 --> 00:04:58,532
This is Joserra...

39
00:04:58,533 --> 00:05:03,198
Chief Steward on Peninsula Flight 2549
to Mexico City.

40
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:05,323
Please, pay attention.

41
00:05:05,324 --> 00:05:08,615
We are about to demonstrate
the safety features on this aircraft.

42
00:05:09,615 --> 00:05:11,742
Observe that there are eight exit doors...

43
00:05:12,742 --> 00:05:15,533
four on each side of the plane.

44
00:05:16,533 --> 00:05:20,533
Each one is marked with the word "Exit".

45
00:05:22,533 --> 00:05:26,282
In front of your seats
and along the aisle floor...

46
00:05:26,283 --> 00:05:28,323
there are lights which will go on
in case of emergency...

47
00:05:28,324 --> 00:05:30,573
showing the evacuation route.

48
00:05:30,574 --> 00:05:33,989
All the emergency exits,
including the windows over the wings...

49
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:36,573
GUADIANA BANK:
INTERVENTION IMMINENT

50
00:05:36,574 --> 00:05:40,282
THE YEAR'S TOP TEN
FINANCIAL SCANDALS

51
00:05:40,283 --> 00:05:41,782
...under your seats...

52
00:05:41,783 --> 00:05:44,741
but should not be taken out
unless they are required.

53
00:05:44,742 --> 00:05:46,989
Each life vest is in a pouch.

54
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:50,532
To remove it,
tug on the protruding red tape...

55
00:05:50,533 --> 00:05:54,989
and to open the pouch pull firmly on it,
as indicated on the pouch.

56
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:58,615
Once the pouch is open,
pull out the life vest and shake it.

57
00:05:59,615 --> 00:06:03,114
To put on the life vest,
slip it over your head...

58
00:06:03,115 --> 00:06:06,198
pass the strap behind your waist...

59
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:09,199
and attach it to the buckle...

60
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:12,074
pulling tightly to adjust it.

61
00:06:18,074 --> 00:06:21,408
To inflate it,
tug firmly on the red plastic toggle.

62
00:06:22,408 --> 00:06:25,448
You can also inflate it
by blowing through the tube.

63
00:06:25,449 --> 00:06:27,949
The life vest should never
be inflated inside the aircraft.

64
00:06:36,949 --> 00:06:40,533
AN HOUR AND A HALF LATER

65
00:07:47,533 --> 00:07:49,364
Ulloa!

66
00:07:49,365 --> 00:07:52,240
-Take it easy!
-I wasn't thinking. Habit.

67
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,400
Norma keeps looking this way.

68
00:07:57,824 --> 00:08:02,657
-Ulloa, go and distract her.
-She doesn't like me, you go.

69
00:08:02,658 --> 00:08:04,323
Me? I can't.

70
00:08:04,324 --> 00:08:06,990
-I have to pray.
-It hasn't helped you much.

71
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:10,114
It's helped me a lot, and you too.

72
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:12,032
Me? How?

73
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:14,532
Where would you be now
without my prayers?

74
00:08:14,533 --> 00:08:16,073
What did you pray for?

75
00:08:16,074 --> 00:08:19,158
That you'd give up drink, drugs
and dark rooms, that's what.

76
00:08:20,158 --> 00:08:24,698
The only pleasures in life!
Why not pray for a husband for me?

77
00:08:24,699 --> 00:08:27,449
I did, but with your temper it isn't easy.

78
00:08:29,449 --> 00:08:31,490
Didn't you pray for me, Fajas?

79
00:08:31,491 --> 00:08:33,449
You haven't got any problems.

80
00:08:34,449 --> 00:08:36,073
You think not?

81
00:08:36,074 --> 00:08:39,991
Of course, you've given up drink
and you've got a husband who loves you.

82
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:53,866
Hello.

83
00:08:55,866 --> 00:08:57,742
You smell of tequila!

84
00:08:58,742 --> 00:09:01,198
-I only had a drop.
-Joserra, not today!

85
00:09:01,199 --> 00:09:03,741
I'm trying, Alex.

86
00:09:03,742 --> 00:09:07,073
-What about the passengers?
-Norma keeps looking at us.

87
00:09:07,074 --> 00:09:10,240
She's furious because
she can't watch movies or use the phone.

88
00:09:10,241 --> 00:09:12,490
You should explain
the technical problem better.

89
00:09:12,491 --> 00:09:14,698
-I don't know how to.
-What about me?

90
00:09:14,699 --> 00:09:16,156
I'm trying to avoid them!

91
00:09:16,157 --> 00:09:19,115
-If they ask, make something up.
-I can't!

92
00:09:19,116 --> 00:09:20,781
You know I can't lie.

93
00:09:20,782 --> 00:09:23,448
-Shall I go back to...?
-No!

94
00:09:23,449 --> 00:09:25,031
Don't go into detail.

95
00:09:25,032 --> 00:09:29,448
-Tell them some technical stuff.
-For me, technical stuff is a kind of lie.

96
00:09:29,449 --> 00:09:31,905
-Give me a break!
-Please, let's not start!

97
00:09:31,906 --> 00:09:33,115
Shall I go back to the Pact?

98
00:09:33,116 --> 00:09:34,198
Right.

99
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:36,079
They have to be kept
entertained and distracted.

100
00:09:36,824 --> 00:09:40,199
And you do that better than anyone,
without any technical stuff.

101
00:09:41,199 --> 00:09:43,490
Just entertain them the way you know.

102
00:09:43,491 --> 00:09:45,199
Today, I don't know.

103
00:09:46,199 --> 00:09:47,824
-Well, what do you want to drink?
-Wine.

104
00:09:48,824 --> 00:09:51,282
-Tea. And you're not to drink.
-Shut up!

105
00:09:53,282 --> 00:09:54,949
Have you spoken to Control again?

106
00:09:55,949 --> 00:09:56,990
Yes.

107
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:59,240
-Any news?
-Yes.

108
00:09:59,241 --> 00:10:01,074
-And?
-It's best if you don't know.

109
00:10:04,074 --> 00:10:05,782
And the runway?

110
00:10:07,782 --> 00:10:09,323
Still no news.

111
00:10:09,324 --> 00:10:11,073
Well, wine and tea.

112
00:10:11,074 --> 00:10:13,616
-And don't drink!
-Shut up!

113
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,096
-Hello!
-Miss, you can't come in here.

114
00:10:18,824 --> 00:10:20,991
-Is anything wrong?
-No, but please leave.

115
00:10:21,991 --> 00:10:24,156
Everyone in Economy Class is asleep.

116
00:10:24,157 --> 00:10:26,365
The stewardesses gave them
a muscle relaxant...

117
00:10:26,366 --> 00:10:28,365
because of Economy Class Syndrome.

118
00:10:28,366 --> 00:10:29,948
That knocked them out.

119
00:10:29,949 --> 00:10:33,323
-The stewardesses are out cold too.
-The poor things are exhausted.

120
00:10:33,324 --> 00:10:37,448
If you need anything,
my colleagues will be happy to serve you.

121
00:10:37,449 --> 00:10:40,532
I'm sensitive. I've got powers.

122
00:10:42,532 --> 00:10:44,240
What... do you mean?

123
00:10:44,241 --> 00:10:45,866
I sense things that other people don't.

124
00:10:46,866 --> 00:10:49,991
And I feel this is going to be
a very special day for everyone.

125
00:10:50,991 --> 00:10:53,448
What do you feel exactly?

126
00:10:53,449 --> 00:10:56,448
Last night I dreamed
my life was going to change...

127
00:10:56,449 --> 00:10:59,406
and this morning I knew it.

128
00:10:59,407 --> 00:11:02,240
Don't ask me how, but I knew it.

129
00:11:02,241 --> 00:11:04,281
You knew what?

130
00:11:04,282 --> 00:11:07,198
Something very big
is going to happen on this flight...

131
00:11:07,199 --> 00:11:08,948
and it will affect all of us.

132
00:11:08,949 --> 00:11:11,240
Why didn't you say something
before you boarded?

133
00:11:11,241 --> 00:11:13,406
Because sometimes people think I'm mad!

134
00:11:13,407 --> 00:11:16,365
Unless the thing is very clear
and I'm very sure...

135
00:11:16,366 --> 00:11:17,741
I never say anything.

136
00:11:17,742 --> 00:11:21,448
Would you mind telling us
exactly what you felt?

137
00:11:21,449 --> 00:11:22,906
As soon as I got up...

138
00:11:23,906 --> 00:11:26,366
I felt that today...

139
00:11:27,366 --> 00:11:28,866
I'd stop being a virgin.

140
00:11:29,866 --> 00:11:32,281
-You're still a virgin?
-Yes.

141
00:11:32,282 --> 00:11:34,905
When men find out I've got powers,
they back off.

142
00:11:34,906 --> 00:11:37,448
And I am a really easy catch,
but it's no use!

143
00:11:37,449 --> 00:11:41,616
Yes, but apart from that,
did you feel anything else?

144
00:11:43,616 --> 00:11:45,199
Yes.

145
00:11:47,199 --> 00:11:48,949
I'm visualizing...

146
00:11:49,949 --> 00:11:52,032
I'm looking for sensations...

147
00:11:54,032 --> 00:11:57,115
Yes, I'm feeling...

148
00:11:57,116 --> 00:11:57,866
I feel...

149
00:11:58,866 --> 00:12:01,116
that we were arriving
at a place that was...

150
00:12:03,116 --> 00:12:04,781
white!

151
00:12:04,782 --> 00:12:06,905
Like a cloud.

152
00:12:06,906 --> 00:12:10,949
A place where we were all better
and lies didn't exist.

153
00:12:11,949 --> 00:12:14,115
That's really corny!

154
00:12:14,116 --> 00:12:17,616
-I saw human blood too.
-Blood?

155
00:12:18,616 --> 00:12:20,281
Is someone going to die?

156
00:12:20,282 --> 00:12:23,698
No. I didn't say that.

157
00:12:23,699 --> 00:12:25,116
But there will be blood.

158
00:12:26,116 --> 00:12:29,115
I'll get your drinks.
I'd forgotten about them.

159
00:12:29,116 --> 00:12:32,698
Joserra, bring tequila instead of wine.

160
00:12:32,699 --> 00:12:34,282
Good idea, tequila.

161
00:12:48,282 --> 00:12:50,616
Fajas, one tea.

162
00:12:51,616 --> 00:12:53,573
Norma wants to make an official complaint.

163
00:12:53,574 --> 00:12:56,905
-She has to do it in writing.
-She wants an official form.

164
00:12:56,906 --> 00:12:59,573
She says with plain paper
we'll just wipe our asses with it.

165
00:12:59,574 --> 00:13:00,742
And she's right!

166
00:13:03,742 --> 00:13:06,656
There's something else.
The Groom...

167
00:13:06,657 --> 00:13:09,615
-Every time he sees me, he winks.
-Isn't he asleep?

168
00:13:09,616 --> 00:13:11,115
Yes, the rest of the time...

169
00:13:11,116 --> 00:13:13,741
but when I appear in the aisle
it's like he detects me...

170
00:13:13,742 --> 00:13:15,324
he opens one eye and he winks.

171
00:13:16,324 --> 00:13:19,573
No, no, it's really extraordinary.

172
00:13:19,574 --> 00:13:21,656
What's extraordinary
is what I have in the cockpit.

173
00:13:21,657 --> 00:13:24,156
A crazy woman came in
and said she's a psychic.

174
00:13:24,157 --> 00:13:27,948
Then she contacted the beyond
through Alex and Benito's crotches...

175
00:13:27,949 --> 00:13:32,240
and she says that something
very big will happen on this trip...

176
00:13:32,241 --> 00:13:34,365
and affect all of us.

177
00:13:34,366 --> 00:13:35,905
She was talking about me.

178
00:13:35,906 --> 00:13:38,490
Something very big
that'll affect all of us.

179
00:13:38,491 --> 00:13:42,199
Mine will be something very big
that'll affect all of us.

180
00:13:46,199 --> 00:13:48,156
Boiling over.

181
00:13:48,157 --> 00:13:51,073
-Really? That much?
-Bitch, not the Groom!

182
00:13:51,074 --> 00:13:52,241
The water!

183
00:13:53,241 --> 00:13:55,990
-Since when can you predict things?
-Since I was a child.

184
00:13:55,991 --> 00:13:58,824
I see things, I feel things,
ever since I was little.

185
00:13:59,824 --> 00:14:03,365
-Do you make money with it?
-Yes. I can't complain.

186
00:14:03,366 --> 00:14:05,990
I work in my town, and abroad.

187
00:14:05,991 --> 00:14:08,116
I'm going to Mexico to work.

188
00:14:09,116 --> 00:14:12,156
-What are you going to do there?
-I specialize in the dead.

189
00:14:12,157 --> 00:14:14,407
-The dead!
-Yes.

190
00:14:15,407 --> 00:14:17,906
I smell death. I feel it.

191
00:14:18,906 --> 00:14:21,490
-Do you feel it here?
-In the cockpit?

192
00:14:21,491 --> 00:14:24,448
No. I'd be retching if I did.

193
00:14:24,449 --> 00:14:26,905
-For sure?
-Yes. Not here.

194
00:14:26,906 --> 00:14:28,698
We have to celebrate that!

195
00:14:28,699 --> 00:14:32,573
-Stop drinking, Joserra!
-Right now, really.

196
00:14:32,574 --> 00:14:34,781
Why are you going to Mexico?

197
00:14:34,782 --> 00:14:37,115
Some Spaniards have disappeared.

198
00:14:37,116 --> 00:14:39,615
Their families think
they've been murdered...

199
00:14:39,616 --> 00:14:41,615
and they've hired me to find them.

200
00:14:41,616 --> 00:14:43,240
How?

201
00:14:43,241 --> 00:14:45,361
I've got addresses
of where they were last seen alive.

202
00:14:45,866 --> 00:14:49,741
-So, you're going as a private detective.
-Not exactly a detective.

203
00:14:49,742 --> 00:14:52,824
To give you an idea,
I'm a kind of water diviner...

204
00:14:53,824 --> 00:14:56,073
except instead of finding water...

205
00:14:56,074 --> 00:14:58,073
I find dead bodies.

206
00:14:58,074 --> 00:14:59,781
Oh, God!

207
00:14:59,782 --> 00:15:01,302
-Joserra!
-I'll try to find the bodies.

208
00:15:01,866 --> 00:15:03,281
-On your own?
-Yes.

209
00:15:03,282 --> 00:15:07,365
Well, some drug lords who were friends
of the victims are going to help me.

210
00:15:07,366 --> 00:15:09,741
Do you know what you're getting into?

211
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:11,656
I'm slightly scared shitless.

212
00:15:11,657 --> 00:15:14,281
I've heard there's
a lot of violence in Mexico...

213
00:15:14,282 --> 00:15:15,948
but they're paying me a fortune.

214
00:15:15,949 --> 00:15:18,490
And I've spoken on the phone
with the Spaniards' friends.

215
00:15:18,491 --> 00:15:20,116
-With the drug lords?
-Yes.

216
00:15:21,116 --> 00:15:23,573
They made a good impression
over the phone.

217
00:15:23,574 --> 00:15:27,073
I'm meeting them in Guadalajara,
which I believe is a lovely place...

218
00:15:27,074 --> 00:15:30,490
and they swore blind
they'll come with me everywhere...

219
00:15:30,491 --> 00:15:33,156
they'll never leave me on my own.

220
00:15:33,157 --> 00:15:35,407
-I think I can trust them.
-The door...

221
00:15:36,407 --> 00:15:38,324
Wait and see if they go away.

222
00:15:43,324 --> 00:15:44,948
They're not going away.

223
00:15:44,949 --> 00:15:45,824
They'll get tired.

224
00:15:48,824 --> 00:15:49,906
They're not getting tired.

225
00:15:50,906 --> 00:15:52,106
I'll open the door.
Act normal.

226
00:15:52,824 --> 00:15:56,532
-And you, hide the tequila.
-Give it to me.

227
00:15:57,532 --> 00:15:58,656
Is there a problem?

228
00:15:58,657 --> 00:16:00,577
What's going on?
I think you're hiding something.

229
00:16:00,824 --> 00:16:04,531
I'm sorry you can't see any movies
or use the armrest phones.

230
00:16:04,532 --> 00:16:06,531
The Chief Steward will have told you...

231
00:16:06,532 --> 00:16:09,282
that in case of emergency
you can use the public telephone...

232
00:16:10,282 --> 00:16:12,366
Breathe through your nose, faggot!

233
00:16:15,366 --> 00:16:18,156
-Yes, I am a faggot.
-And?

234
00:16:18,157 --> 00:16:20,031
-And the other two stewards.
-And?

235
00:16:20,032 --> 00:16:22,281
-Isn't that what you wanted to know?
-No. Just breathe.

236
00:16:22,282 --> 00:16:24,448
-And the pilots?
-What about the pilots?

237
00:16:24,449 --> 00:16:26,156
Are they faggots too?

238
00:16:26,157 --> 00:16:28,156
This one is bisexual,
and he and I are lovers.

239
00:16:28,157 --> 00:16:29,958
-Shut up! Have you lost your mind?
-Excuse me.

240
00:16:30,824 --> 00:16:33,866
This is confidential
information, obviously.

241
00:16:34,866 --> 00:16:39,240
Captain Alex Acero is married
with two children, aged 11 and 13.

242
00:16:39,241 --> 00:16:44,905
Very difficult ages, as you can understand,
for their father to be outed.

243
00:16:44,906 --> 00:16:46,698
-And the other one?
-Benito?

244
00:16:46,699 --> 00:16:48,866
No, I'm hetero, and unhappily married.

245
00:16:49,866 --> 00:16:53,573
I've been trying to leave my wife
for years, but it's impossible.

246
00:16:53,574 --> 00:16:56,323
I've even thought of pretending
to have an affair with a man...

247
00:16:56,324 --> 00:16:58,281
because that's the only thing
she wouldn't stand for.

248
00:16:58,282 --> 00:17:01,073
But I don't like men.

249
00:17:01,074 --> 00:17:04,073
-How do you know? Have you tried them?
-No.

250
00:17:04,074 --> 00:17:07,157
Well, also off the record...

251
00:17:07,158 --> 00:17:11,573
I did try sucking a dick once,
so as not to rule out the possibility.

252
00:17:11,574 --> 00:17:14,532
I'm not prejudiced,
I've got lots of gay friends.

253
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:18,158
I started retching!

254
00:17:19,158 --> 00:17:21,448
Like when you shoot up heroin!

255
00:17:21,449 --> 00:17:23,282
Haven't you thought about killing her?

256
00:17:23,283 --> 00:17:25,073
-Who?
-Your wife.

257
00:17:25,074 --> 00:17:28,114
You South Americans always think
killing is the solution.

258
00:17:28,115 --> 00:17:29,740
Only in extreme situations.

259
00:17:29,741 --> 00:17:31,948
And I'm not South American, I'm Mexican.

260
00:17:31,949 --> 00:17:34,448
-Even worse! Life has no value there!
-You're wrong.

261
00:17:34,449 --> 00:17:36,073
Some people will pay millions
for their lives.

262
00:17:36,074 --> 00:17:39,114
-That's enough chitchat.
-I want to know...

263
00:17:39,115 --> 00:17:41,698
Yes, we all want to know...

264
00:17:41,699 --> 00:17:44,114
but we have to clear the cockpit.

265
00:17:44,115 --> 00:17:46,824
Passengers aren't allowed in here,
and much less en masse.

266
00:17:47,824 --> 00:17:50,489
And stewards aren't allowed
to get blind drunk.

267
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:52,198
You're absolutely right.

268
00:17:52,199 --> 00:17:54,782
Mind that hand!

269
00:17:54,783 --> 00:17:58,490
I don't like being touched.
Move, you useless cows!

270
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:08,490
-Aren't you eating any more?
-No.

271
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:16,573
Sorry! I wanted to distract them,
like you said.

272
00:18:16,574 --> 00:18:18,906
And so you talked about my private life?

273
00:18:18,907 --> 00:18:20,989
It was the first thing I thought of,
and it worked.

274
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:23,448
-You're outrageous!
-I said I was sorry!

275
00:18:23,449 --> 00:18:25,657
I warned you not to drink!

276
00:18:25,658 --> 00:18:28,489
Alex, I'm desolate.

277
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:30,282
As the French say, je suis désolé

278
00:18:30,283 --> 00:18:32,824
I don't know...
if you understand me.

279
00:18:33,824 --> 00:18:37,573
Speaking of the French,
or rather... "French culture"!

280
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:39,864
-Have you nothing to tell me?
-Me?

281
00:18:39,865 --> 00:18:41,073
-About what?
-About madame!

282
00:18:41,074 --> 00:18:44,657
-I'm not female!
-Shut up, experimental cock sucker!

283
00:18:44,658 --> 00:18:46,532
Sucking a colleague's boyfriend's dick!

284
00:18:46,533 --> 00:18:48,364
I was drunk, it was just to try.

285
00:18:48,365 --> 00:18:50,448
Better to do it
with someone healthy that you know.

286
00:18:50,449 --> 00:18:53,074
-And with a big dick!
-That's enough!

287
00:18:57,074 --> 00:18:59,989
-Come in!
-Jesus, not another one!

288
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:02,865
I'm sorry, you can't come in here.

289
00:19:03,865 --> 00:19:06,698
I have a pilot's license.
I can lend a hand, if necessary.

290
00:19:06,699 --> 00:19:10,158
-Thank you, I don't think it will be.
-We've got a problem.

291
00:19:11,158 --> 00:19:13,033
With the Guadiana Bank?

292
00:19:14,033 --> 00:19:15,323
No.

293
00:19:15,324 --> 00:19:16,824
I'm talking about the landing gear.

294
00:19:17,824 --> 00:19:20,741
I didn't want to ask earlier,
so as not to alarm anyone.

295
00:19:21,741 --> 00:19:24,907
-Have you spoken to the Control Tower?
-Yes.

296
00:19:25,907 --> 00:19:26,989
COMPLAINTS FORM

297
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:29,407
I would like to register
a most severe complaint...

298
00:19:29,408 --> 00:19:31,907
about the dreadful service
provided in Business Class...

299
00:19:37,907 --> 00:19:40,074
You don't have to slam it down...

300
00:19:41,074 --> 00:19:42,614
but it does taste much better.

301
00:19:42,615 --> 00:19:44,615
It sure does.

302
00:19:45,615 --> 00:19:49,114
I need a booster to face those savages.

303
00:19:49,115 --> 00:19:52,782
When you act the heroine, you scare me.

304
00:19:52,783 --> 00:19:54,115
Want some?

305
00:19:56,115 --> 00:19:58,074
Can you sign here, please?

306
00:19:59,074 --> 00:20:01,240
I'll sign, but I don't think
it'll do any good.

307
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,615
Thank you. I'll take care of that.

308
00:20:06,615 --> 00:20:09,114
-Do we know each other?
-No.

309
00:20:09,115 --> 00:20:12,282
Well, I know who you are,
but, we've never met, ma'am.

310
00:20:12,283 --> 00:20:15,448
You needn't call me ma'am.

311
00:20:15,449 --> 00:20:18,698
-In Marbella, perhaps?
-I've never been to Marbella.

312
00:20:18,699 --> 00:20:20,283
Well, your face looks familiar.

313
00:20:21,283 --> 00:20:24,783
I must have an average face,
I'm often told that.

314
00:20:31,783 --> 00:20:33,741
Alba?

315
00:20:34,741 --> 00:20:36,074
Alba!

316
00:20:47,074 --> 00:20:51,533
-What is it?
-An official complaint.

317
00:20:52,533 --> 00:20:56,615
-What about?
-I'll explain later. Sign, please.

318
00:21:00,615 --> 00:21:02,158
Thank you.

319
00:21:05,158 --> 00:21:06,118
Sign, if you don't mind.

320
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:13,948
When we get to Mexico, we're going to report
the Peninsula Company and all of you...

321
00:21:13,949 --> 00:21:16,489
including the stewardesses
in Economy Class!

322
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:18,850
I tried to get them to serve us
and they're all fast asleep!

323
00:21:19,824 --> 00:21:21,544
So are the passengers.
They've been drugged.

324
00:21:22,158 --> 00:21:25,906
The pilot told me
they took a muscle relaxant.

325
00:21:25,907 --> 00:21:27,698
That's why they're asleep.

326
00:21:27,699 --> 00:21:29,283
You're obviously retarded.

327
00:21:31,283 --> 00:21:33,033
When we get to Mexico, you're in for it!

328
00:21:36,033 --> 00:21:38,033
Maybe we'll never land in Mexico.

329
00:21:40,033 --> 00:21:44,033
Right now,
we're flying in circles around Toledo.

330
00:21:45,033 --> 00:21:47,364
Toledo, Ohio?

331
00:21:47,365 --> 00:21:50,907
No, Toledo, Castile-La Mancha.

332
00:21:51,907 --> 00:21:53,824
-Are you kidding me?
-No.

333
00:21:54,824 --> 00:21:56,323
What do you mean?

334
00:21:56,324 --> 00:22:00,073
Part of the landing gear
isn't working, so...

335
00:22:00,074 --> 00:22:03,740
we have to do an emergency landing
and that's very dangerous.

336
00:22:03,741 --> 00:22:08,657
The runway has to be prepared
in a special way... A whole fuss.

337
00:22:08,658 --> 00:22:11,989
Why don't they prepare it now?
What are they waiting for?

338
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:15,407
To find a free airport.
We still don't have a runway.

339
00:22:15,408 --> 00:22:17,906
-And Barajas?
-That's no use.

340
00:22:17,907 --> 00:22:22,282
The air space is blocked because
of the UN Security Summit in Madrid.

341
00:22:22,283 --> 00:22:25,073
And we need the opposite,
a completely empty runway.

342
00:22:25,074 --> 00:22:29,364
-What are we going to do? -For the
time being, keep flying in circles.

343
00:22:29,365 --> 00:22:32,198
Why isn't the landing gear working?

344
00:22:32,199 --> 00:22:36,573
The pilots didn't want to tell me
because I... spill the beans.

345
00:22:36,574 --> 00:22:38,698
One of the struts won't drop down.

346
00:22:38,699 --> 00:22:41,282
-The pilots have confirmed that.
-Why won't it drop?

347
00:22:41,283 --> 00:22:45,239
They forgot to remove the chocks
at the airport, or they did it badly.

348
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:48,407
We swallowed them, that's why
the landing gear doesn't work.

349
00:22:48,408 --> 00:22:49,989
Now I understand.

350
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:53,282
But don't worry, our captain
is an expert in emergencies.

351
00:22:53,283 --> 00:22:54,865
With a wife, two kids, a boyfriend
and a male lover, he should be!

352
00:22:55,865 --> 00:22:57,948
Benito isn't his lover!

353
00:22:57,949 --> 00:23:00,198
They both swore to me
it was just a blow job.

354
00:23:00,199 --> 00:23:04,782
Has it happened before?
Do you know of other similar cases?

355
00:23:04,783 --> 00:23:08,532
I don't know, with a bisexual
you can never be sure.

356
00:23:08,533 --> 00:23:11,408
I mean, other cases where
the landing gear hasn't worked.

357
00:23:12,408 --> 00:23:14,198
-Oh, that...
-Yes. It's happened before.

358
00:23:14,199 --> 00:23:18,240
-In Gerona, in fact...
-And how did it end?

359
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:23,283
The plane broke in three when it landed,
but only two people were killed.

360
00:23:24,283 --> 00:23:26,782
This is a murder attempt!

361
00:23:26,783 --> 00:23:29,198
They want to kill me!
They want to take me out!

362
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:31,657
-Calm down!
-Maybe nothing will happen.

363
00:23:31,658 --> 00:23:34,114
They had the same problem in Andorra
and nothing happened.

364
00:23:34,115 --> 00:23:37,573
They're after me!
They want to take me out!

365
00:23:37,574 --> 00:23:40,199
You don't understand...

366
00:23:43,199 --> 00:23:45,532
Sorry.

367
00:23:45,533 --> 00:23:48,573
The National Security Agency is behind this!
They want me out of the way!

368
00:23:48,574 --> 00:23:50,698
It's not the NSA.

369
00:23:50,699 --> 00:23:52,698
How do you know?
You know everything!

370
00:23:52,699 --> 00:23:56,073
I wish I did.
But I know how the NSA works.

371
00:23:56,074 --> 00:23:59,533
And I know how I work!
They want to get rid of me!

372
00:24:00,533 --> 00:24:02,489
Calm down, please.

373
00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:04,573
Don't look at me like that!
I'm not crazy!

374
00:24:04,574 --> 00:24:06,782
Fajas, clean that up.

375
00:24:06,783 --> 00:24:08,907
We have to stay calm!

376
00:24:10,907 --> 00:24:14,365
Several years ago, a passenger
had a terrible panic attack...

377
00:24:15,365 --> 00:24:17,199
and he wanted to go into the cockpit.

378
00:24:18,199 --> 00:24:22,448
Business Class was full of executives
who immediately became paranoid...

379
00:24:22,449 --> 00:24:25,573
they thought he was a terrorist.

380
00:24:25,574 --> 00:24:30,573
The three of us tried to persuade
the man to sit down.

381
00:24:30,574 --> 00:24:33,199
I went in there and prepared
an injection to sedate him.

382
00:24:34,199 --> 00:24:35,283
But...

383
00:24:36,283 --> 00:24:38,949
when I came back out here
it was too late.

384
00:24:40,949 --> 00:24:42,865
The executives had immobilized him and...

385
00:24:44,865 --> 00:24:46,408
suffocated him with a pillow.

386
00:24:47,408 --> 00:24:49,615
Was it on this same plane?

387
00:24:50,615 --> 00:24:52,573
Yes, an Airbus 340.

388
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:55,865
-But was it exactly this one?
-How would I know that?

389
00:24:56,865 --> 00:24:59,408
What happened afterwards?

390
00:25:00,408 --> 00:25:02,408
We said that he'd died of natural causes.

391
00:25:03,408 --> 00:25:05,865
It was decided by a majority vote
to make a Pact of Silence...

392
00:25:06,865 --> 00:25:10,532
a Pact I'm betraying right now,
but I don't care...

393
00:25:10,533 --> 00:25:12,115
because I didn't mean it.

394
00:25:13,115 --> 00:25:16,115
The papers said
that he'd died of heart failure.

395
00:25:17,115 --> 00:25:20,740
I was so traumatized by it all,
as you can understand...

396
00:25:20,741 --> 00:25:22,782
that since then
I'm incapable of lying.

397
00:25:22,783 --> 00:25:26,283
That's why the pilots
won't tell me anything. Loose lips.

398
00:25:27,283 --> 00:25:29,698
I read about that and I didn't believe it.

399
00:25:29,699 --> 00:25:31,657
-It sounded very odd.
-I'll say!

400
00:25:31,658 --> 00:25:33,657
We have to stay calm.

401
00:25:33,658 --> 00:25:38,198
My colleagues and I will try to make
this flight as pleasant as possible.

402
00:25:38,199 --> 00:25:40,157
Don't ask me how.

403
00:25:40,158 --> 00:25:43,533
I promise that I won't drink
another drop of alcohol.

404
00:25:44,533 --> 00:25:48,073
Between the three of us we have
a repertoire of musical numbers...

405
00:25:48,074 --> 00:25:52,615
that, if you wish, we can sing for you.

406
00:25:55,615 --> 00:25:57,949
He always gets like this, poor thing!

407
00:25:58,949 --> 00:26:01,198
I'll pass around the list of songs now.

408
00:26:01,199 --> 00:26:05,615
It may not be the best time
but otherwise I'll forget.

409
00:26:09,615 --> 00:26:11,115
I'm going to pray for you all.

410
00:26:14,115 --> 00:26:16,989
Well, I imagine
you'd like something to drink.

411
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:18,657
-What can I get you?
-Whiskey.

412
00:26:18,658 --> 00:26:20,448
-Whiskey.
-Two.

413
00:26:20,449 --> 00:26:22,032
Two.

414
00:26:22,033 --> 00:26:24,114
I need a phone.

415
00:26:24,115 --> 00:26:26,073
-Need to be blown?
-A phone.

416
00:26:26,074 --> 00:26:28,323
The phones in the armrests aren't working.

417
00:26:28,324 --> 00:26:31,324
-And the public phone?
-It's only for urgent calls.

418
00:26:32,324 --> 00:26:34,573
Mine is urgent.

419
00:26:34,574 --> 00:26:38,657
I was to pick up some things from a
friend's house in Madrid this evening.

420
00:26:38,658 --> 00:26:41,906
In Madrid?
But we're supposed to be flying to Mexico.

421
00:26:41,907 --> 00:26:44,532
How could you go to Madrid
this evening if we were in Mexico?

422
00:26:44,533 --> 00:26:47,698
-Ulloa, mind your own business!
-I lied to her.

423
00:26:47,699 --> 00:26:52,074
But, given the circumstances,
I'd feel better if I called her.

424
00:26:53,074 --> 00:26:54,989
Everyone will hear
what's said on the other end.

425
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:56,532
I suppose you don't mind.

426
00:26:56,533 --> 00:26:59,989
The speaker broke ages ago
but, apart from that, it works fine.

427
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:03,033
-May I have a gin and tonic?
-Of course.

428
00:28:16,033 --> 00:28:17,073
Yes?

429
00:28:17,074 --> 00:28:20,782
Hello. It's me, Ricardo.

430
00:28:20,783 --> 00:28:22,490
Ricardo!

431
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:29,574
Hang on a minute!

432
00:28:30,574 --> 00:28:34,239
-Is this a bad time?
-God, not at all!

433
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:37,614
It's just that... Wait.

434
00:28:37,615 --> 00:28:38,895
Are you OK?
You sound agitated...

435
00:28:39,865 --> 00:28:42,408
No, I'm... Ricardo!

436
00:28:43,408 --> 00:28:45,324
You sound really far away!

437
00:28:47,324 --> 00:28:49,573
Alba?

438
00:28:49,574 --> 00:28:50,115
Alba!

439
00:28:52,115 --> 00:28:53,989
What are you doing?

440
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:56,783
Don't do anything stupid!

441
00:29:03,783 --> 00:29:06,698
What? I'm not Alba.

442
00:29:06,699 --> 00:29:09,114
-What's going on?
-I don't know.

443
00:29:09,115 --> 00:29:13,032
I was passing under the Viaduct
and this phone fell into my basket.

444
00:29:13,033 --> 00:29:15,489
Did anything else fall?

445
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:17,073
No... like what?

446
00:29:17,074 --> 00:29:19,698
-A woman's body.
-What are you talking about?

447
00:29:19,699 --> 00:29:23,158
-Who are you?
-My name is Ricardo Galán.

448
00:29:24,158 --> 00:29:26,949
Ricardo, is that you?

449
00:29:27,949 --> 00:29:32,698
-I didn't recognize your voice!
-Ruthie! Same here!

450
00:29:32,699 --> 00:29:35,448
It's this telephone!

451
00:29:35,449 --> 00:29:37,907
Look, I'm on a trip.
I'm on a plane...

452
00:29:38,907 --> 00:29:40,364
It's great to hear you!

453
00:29:40,365 --> 00:29:43,198
-Did you throw me the phone?
-No, I couldn't!

454
00:29:43,199 --> 00:29:45,198
I'm inside a plane.

455
00:29:45,199 --> 00:29:46,698
Listen to me...

456
00:29:46,699 --> 00:29:49,157
I listened to you for three years!

457
00:29:49,158 --> 00:29:52,989
This time it's different.
I'm in a desperate situation.

458
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:57,532
You're always in desperate situations,
and I always believed you.

459
00:29:57,533 --> 00:29:59,073
But that's over. Remember?

460
00:29:59,074 --> 00:30:02,073
It's been over for 247 days.

461
00:30:02,074 --> 00:30:03,864
I remember, Ruth.

462
00:30:03,865 --> 00:30:06,448
The phone you're talking on is Alba's.

463
00:30:06,449 --> 00:30:09,364
I was talking to her a minute ago,
it must have slipped out of her hand.

464
00:30:09,365 --> 00:30:13,364
And why did it slip out of that slut's hand
and just happen to fall on me?

465
00:30:13,365 --> 00:30:19,533
Maybe she was about to jump off the Viaduct
when you passed underneath.

466
00:30:20,533 --> 00:30:23,198
I know I'm in no position
to ask you for anything...

467
00:30:23,199 --> 00:30:27,990
but could you please go back
and make sure nothing's happened?

468
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:30,699
Alba is mentally ill.

469
00:30:33,699 --> 00:30:36,074
I'll go back, don't hang up.

470
00:30:49,074 --> 00:30:51,490
I'm under the Viaduct
and I don't see anything odd...

471
00:30:52,490 --> 00:30:54,282
so you needn't worry.

472
00:30:54,283 --> 00:30:56,698
And now I'm going to leave
the phone on the ground...

473
00:30:56,699 --> 00:30:59,574
as if I hadn't passed under the Viaduct.

474
00:31:00,574 --> 00:31:02,533
Goodbye.

475
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:10,074
Call her back!

476
00:31:11,074 --> 00:31:13,824
If I were Ruth,
I'd be waiting for you to call me.

477
00:31:30,824 --> 00:31:32,449
I'm not going to pick you up.

478
00:31:33,449 --> 00:31:35,741
You're not part of my life, Ricardo.

479
00:31:36,741 --> 00:31:39,783
The Ruth that you knew
doesn't exist anymore.

480
00:31:40,783 --> 00:31:43,783
She disappeared with you.

481
00:32:40,783 --> 00:32:43,741
Wait, let me see that Cartier...

482
00:32:49,741 --> 00:32:52,574
She's not allowed sharp objects
in the hospital, is she?

483
00:33:04,574 --> 00:33:06,783
What does that loony want?

484
00:33:13,783 --> 00:33:15,449
Get in, please, miss.

485
00:33:18,449 --> 00:33:20,407
I'll call you later for news.

486
00:33:20,408 --> 00:33:21,989
Aren't you coming with us?

487
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:24,573
-Do I have to?
-Yes, it's better.

488
00:33:24,574 --> 00:33:27,740
I've got a cocktail now,
I have no time for this.

489
00:33:27,741 --> 00:33:30,033
It's best if you come with us.

490
00:33:42,033 --> 00:33:43,074
What a pity!

491
00:33:48,074 --> 00:33:50,240
You've got a cut!

492
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,906
The dove!
She threw it out the window.

493
00:33:53,907 --> 00:33:56,907
I was picking his things
and it landed on my head.

494
00:33:57,907 --> 00:34:00,990
-Look, I must have a really deep cut.
-You do.

495
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:03,990
Give me the sweater.

496
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:07,532
Come on.

497
00:34:10,532 --> 00:34:12,948
It isn't the first time
she's had an attack.

498
00:34:12,949 --> 00:34:16,281
I don't know how her mother
lets her live on her own.

499
00:34:16,282 --> 00:34:19,114
She's run away several times
from the psychiatric hospital!

500
00:34:19,115 --> 00:34:21,364
But you saw the mother.

501
00:34:21,365 --> 00:34:23,614
She's more worried
about what's happening to Dior...

502
00:34:23,615 --> 00:34:25,239
than about her daughter.

503
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:28,449
Mr. Galán didn't want
to leave her on her own, but...

504
00:34:28,450 --> 00:34:29,699
Mr. Galán!

505
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:33,281
Yes, the actor, Ricardo Galán.

506
00:34:33,282 --> 00:34:34,781
He was her boyfriend.

507
00:34:34,782 --> 00:34:37,281
They broke up months ago.
He didn't come here anymore.

508
00:34:37,282 --> 00:34:37,865
Well, he did.

509
00:34:38,865 --> 00:34:42,489
He came to get the personal stuff
she'd stolen from him.

510
00:34:42,490 --> 00:34:43,989
She wouldn't give it back.

511
00:34:43,990 --> 00:34:46,489
All that stuff in the street is his.

512
00:34:46,490 --> 00:34:49,864
This cashmere sweater, really good...
Slashed!

513
00:34:49,865 --> 00:34:53,656
The bird, probably a gift
from some one-night stand.

514
00:34:53,657 --> 00:34:56,324
He'd come here
and there'd be a scene...

515
00:34:56,325 --> 00:34:59,406
-How do you know all this?
-He told me himself.

516
00:34:59,407 --> 00:35:02,156
As he knows I don't gossip
and I'm a big fan of his...

517
00:35:02,157 --> 00:35:04,156
he was always honest with me.

518
00:35:04,157 --> 00:35:06,699
Have you seen how he looks now?

519
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:10,324
He's skin and bone,
from the scenes, not from excesses...

520
00:35:10,325 --> 00:35:11,989
like I've read in some magazines.

521
00:35:11,990 --> 00:35:14,614
I'm not surprised he headed off to Mexico.

522
00:35:14,615 --> 00:35:17,824
He's probably in the air now.
He got work in a Mexican soap.

523
00:35:18,824 --> 00:35:20,700
By the way, who are you?

524
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:24,781
I'm an old friend of Ricardo.

525
00:35:24,782 --> 00:35:27,031
He asked me to come and get his things.

526
00:35:27,032 --> 00:35:29,948
There's more upstairs. Will you
come up or shall I bring them down?

527
00:35:29,949 --> 00:35:32,490
-I'll go with you.
-That's better.

528
00:35:37,490 --> 00:35:40,364
She's a painter.
Well, you can see that!

529
00:35:40,365 --> 00:35:42,685
Half an hour ago, she came
running in here, like a lunatic.

530
00:35:42,824 --> 00:35:44,281
She didn't even recognize me!

531
00:35:44,282 --> 00:35:46,989
She started throwing
his things out the window.

532
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:49,406
I had to call the hospital and her mother.

533
00:35:49,407 --> 00:35:51,114
She said it was inconvenient.

534
00:35:51,115 --> 00:35:53,198
I don't understand her.

535
00:35:53,199 --> 00:35:56,949
You can't have a daughter
living on her own in these conditions!

536
00:35:59,949 --> 00:36:02,531
I remember the day
I showed her the apartment.

537
00:36:02,532 --> 00:36:06,907
Miss Alba was just where you are now,
next to the window.

538
00:36:07,907 --> 00:36:12,741
She told me that she'd take it,
that she liked living close to the abyss.

539
00:36:12,742 --> 00:36:15,074
At the time I didn't understand
what she meant.

540
00:36:19,074 --> 00:36:21,198
-So you've come for the case?
-Yes.

541
00:36:21,199 --> 00:36:21,824
I'll help you.

542
00:36:31,824 --> 00:36:34,032
Have you really got nothing to tell me?

543
00:36:35,032 --> 00:36:36,700
No.

544
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:44,949
It's no shame to have had
an affair with Mr. Galán.

545
00:36:45,949 --> 00:36:48,657
You weren't the only one.

546
00:37:32,657 --> 00:37:34,157
-Yes?
-Ruthie, is that you?

547
00:37:36,157 --> 00:37:39,031
-Yes.
-I'm glad to hear you again.

548
00:37:39,032 --> 00:37:42,074
-Any word about Alba?
-An ambulance came and took her away.

549
00:37:43,074 --> 00:37:46,699
They've committed her again?
That's best.

550
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:49,700
-Thank you.
-Are you drinking?

551
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:55,073
Yes... Well, we're all drinking.

552
00:37:55,074 --> 00:37:58,324
Alba was about to jump off the Viaduct
and you're celebrating?

553
00:37:58,325 --> 00:38:00,199
No! How could I celebrate that!

554
00:38:01,199 --> 00:38:03,574
It's just...

555
00:38:03,575 --> 00:38:05,449
I didn't want to tell you...

556
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:08,531
-Don't tell her!
-Tell me!

557
00:38:08,532 --> 00:38:11,699
They're telling me not to say anything.

558
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:13,574
But I'm going to tell you.

559
00:38:13,575 --> 00:38:15,656
You're a stewardess,
you'll understand better than I do.

560
00:38:15,657 --> 00:38:17,074
Ex-stewardess.

561
00:38:18,074 --> 00:38:20,782
Well, ex-stewardess...

562
00:38:21,782 --> 00:38:23,343
Part of the landing gear isn't working.

563
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,324
We're flying around aimlessly...

564
00:38:25,325 --> 00:38:28,906
and we still don't know where
or how we're going to land.

565
00:38:28,907 --> 00:38:29,867
We swallowed the chocks.

566
00:38:30,865 --> 00:38:33,364
How can you joke about these things?

567
00:38:33,365 --> 00:38:36,364
I'm not joking,
I've got no idea what chocks are.

568
00:38:36,365 --> 00:38:38,948
It's the first time
I've ever heard of them.

569
00:38:38,949 --> 00:38:42,198
-That's enough!
-I'm not lying to you.

570
00:38:42,199 --> 00:38:44,199
Believe me, even if it's just this once.

571
00:38:45,199 --> 00:38:46,907
This might be my last call.

572
00:38:55,907 --> 00:38:57,489
Everything OK?

573
00:38:57,490 --> 00:39:00,324
The one time I tell her the truth,
she doesn't believe me.

574
00:39:00,325 --> 00:39:02,157
You lied to her a lot, didn't you?

575
00:39:03,157 --> 00:39:04,906
A lot.

576
00:39:04,907 --> 00:39:07,741
I'm going to take a tranquilizer,
an anti-depressant and a sleeping pill.

577
00:39:07,742 --> 00:39:10,449
-With or without alcohol?
-No, I'll just finish this.

578
00:39:10,450 --> 00:39:13,948
-Please don't wake me until we've arrived.
-Don't worry.

579
00:39:13,949 --> 00:39:15,699
The Chief Steward is the most outrageous

580
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:17,574
and he usually only has
one catharsis per flight.

581
00:39:17,575 --> 00:39:20,115
-He's had two already!
-Two.

582
00:39:32,115 --> 00:39:34,574
-I feel awful!
-Have more chamomile tea.

583
00:39:34,575 --> 00:39:37,156
-It doesn't agree with me.
-That's good.

584
00:39:37,157 --> 00:39:39,114
Take this, it'll make you feel better.

585
00:39:39,115 --> 00:39:41,948
-What is it?
-Peppermint and star anise.

586
00:39:41,949 --> 00:39:45,281
They're very carminative.
I make them at home.

587
00:39:45,282 --> 00:39:45,865
Here.

588
00:39:46,865 --> 00:39:48,742
Take it.

589
00:39:54,742 --> 00:39:57,948
Fighting with your boyfriend
on a day like this!

590
00:39:57,949 --> 00:40:01,198
-Did he ask about me?
-Not yet. He's afraid of you.

591
00:40:01,199 --> 00:40:03,449
-Go and see him.
-Me? No!

592
00:40:03,450 --> 00:40:07,031
Not after that business with Benito.
He humiliated me in front of everyone.

593
00:40:07,032 --> 00:40:09,656
It was only a blow job,
and they were drunk.

594
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:11,218
When men get drunk,
that's normal, girl.

595
00:40:11,824 --> 00:40:14,781
They learn it during military service.

596
00:40:14,782 --> 00:40:17,990
In the army I had more blow jobs
than an air bed.

597
00:40:20,990 --> 00:40:22,407
What?

598
00:40:24,407 --> 00:40:26,073
-Hello?
-This is Tere.

599
00:40:26,074 --> 00:40:28,574
-Hi, love...
-Listen, gather up the clothes.

600
00:40:28,575 --> 00:40:30,531
-The clothes...
-Yes, the clothes.

601
00:40:30,532 --> 00:40:33,989
Put them away, the sweaters, this
season's stuff, the vintage, everything!

602
00:40:33,990 --> 00:40:35,656
I can hardly hear you, Tere.

603
00:40:35,657 --> 00:40:38,198
Put everything away!
You know where.

604
00:40:38,199 --> 00:40:40,614
-Is anything wrong?
-Don't shout!

605
00:40:40,615 --> 00:40:43,489
-A murder attempt, I think...
-I can't hear you. Don't mutter.

606
00:40:43,490 --> 00:40:45,989
-I can't speak any louder.
-Did you say murder attempt?

607
00:40:45,990 --> 00:40:48,073
-Against who?
-Me, of course! Who do you think!

608
00:40:48,074 --> 00:40:49,325
Oh, my God!

609
00:40:50,325 --> 00:40:52,531
Could you please stop listening?

610
00:40:52,532 --> 00:40:56,364
I'm listening to you.
What's going on? Tere!

611
00:40:56,365 --> 00:40:59,489
-This is a private conversation.
-Of course. We're alone.

612
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:02,031
They listened to me, and I didn't mind!

613
00:41:02,032 --> 00:41:06,074
-And mine was a lot more humiliating!
-Did I hear humiliating?

614
00:41:08,074 --> 00:41:09,699
Call the Minister!

615
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:11,406
I can barely hear you...

616
00:41:11,407 --> 00:41:13,527
-I call the Minister, and what do I do?
-Threaten him!

617
00:41:13,824 --> 00:41:16,324
I can't hear you... You never
pronounce the last two syllables.

618
00:41:16,325 --> 00:41:18,700
Speak louder, she can't hear you.

619
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:21,531
Threaten him!

620
00:41:21,532 --> 00:41:23,989
-With you know what!
-With I know what...

621
00:41:23,990 --> 00:41:24,824
What do I know?

622
00:41:25,824 --> 00:41:28,239
Tere, don't...

623
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:30,907
What's that noise?

624
00:41:31,907 --> 00:41:35,989
Peninsula 2549, we are processing
your request for an alternative runway.

625
00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:37,531
We still haven't found anything.

626
00:41:37,532 --> 00:41:40,907
-How's that possible?
-We're following procedure.

627
00:41:41,907 --> 00:41:44,614
-Give me an estimated time.
-I don't know.

628
00:41:44,615 --> 00:41:47,199
But sooner or later
we'll find a free runway.

629
00:41:50,199 --> 00:41:54,281
-What's the situation at La Mancha airport?
-There's general indignation.

630
00:41:54,282 --> 00:41:57,114
Apparently the financing
was a massive fraud.

631
00:41:57,115 --> 00:41:59,073
It's all people are talking about.

632
00:41:59,074 --> 00:42:03,282
-But is the airport operating?
-I'll find out, and I'll call you.

633
00:42:06,282 --> 00:42:09,700
Mr. Mas is president of Guadiana Bank,
they financed the project.

634
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:12,240
I think he's clearing out.

635
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:29,365
She's my daughter.

636
00:42:30,365 --> 00:42:31,949
What do you think?

637
00:42:32,949 --> 00:42:34,782
Very cute.

638
00:42:35,782 --> 00:42:38,114
-Do you know her?
-Me?

639
00:42:38,115 --> 00:42:40,281
Why would I know her?

640
00:42:40,282 --> 00:42:43,032
-She's an artiste too.
-I see...

641
00:42:54,032 --> 00:42:56,281
She left us two years ago.

642
00:42:56,282 --> 00:42:59,365
Since then we've heard nothing from her.

643
00:43:00,365 --> 00:43:04,239
I managed to find out
that she's working as...

644
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:06,364
a dominatrix.

645
00:43:06,365 --> 00:43:09,282
I didn't tell her mother.
She's ultra-Catholic, just imagine.

646
00:43:10,282 --> 00:43:12,781
Don't believe what people say.

647
00:43:12,782 --> 00:43:15,781
We gave her the best education...

648
00:43:15,782 --> 00:43:18,365
but we must have done something wrong.

649
00:43:19,365 --> 00:43:19,907
For sure.

650
00:43:20,907 --> 00:43:23,574
-Where did we fail?
-You're asking me?

651
00:43:23,575 --> 00:43:26,365
Not a single call
since she left two years ago.

652
00:43:29,365 --> 00:43:33,325
-Are you ultra-Catholic too?
-I'm not ultra-anything.

653
00:43:34,325 --> 00:43:36,324
I'm just a businessman...

654
00:43:36,325 --> 00:43:40,031
who'd like to be able to tell his daughter
that her mother has changed...

655
00:43:40,032 --> 00:43:42,532
and is dying, literally, to talk to her.

656
00:43:52,532 --> 00:43:54,032
Hello!

657
00:43:55,032 --> 00:43:56,450
I was out cold!

658
00:43:57,450 --> 00:44:00,699
A lot of people on this flight are asleep!

659
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:03,656
-Where are we now?
-Near Toledo!

660
00:44:03,657 --> 00:44:05,198
We're flying in circles.

661
00:44:05,199 --> 00:44:09,032
When we land, the plane might split apart,
or it's possible we'll explode.

662
00:44:12,032 --> 00:44:14,365
-Excuse me!
-Yes, yes...

663
00:44:15,365 --> 00:44:18,574
The Groom is awake and he wants to know!
Tell him something.

664
00:44:18,575 --> 00:44:21,114
-Will I go?
-Not you, silly girl!

665
00:44:21,115 --> 00:44:24,699
-We're making Valencia cocktail.
-What a good idea!

666
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:27,615
Hello.

667
00:44:29,615 --> 00:44:30,907
What's going on?

668
00:44:31,907 --> 00:44:36,989
I've just heard we're still in Toledo
and we might explode when we land.

669
00:44:36,990 --> 00:44:38,614
What an exaggeration!

670
00:44:38,615 --> 00:44:41,073
We have a few little problems.

671
00:44:41,074 --> 00:44:43,355
Very serious ones, to be honest.
We're drinking to forget.

672
00:44:43,865 --> 00:44:45,906
I'm not!
I've given up alcohol.

673
00:44:45,907 --> 00:44:47,741
We're making Valencia cocktail
for the passengers.

674
00:44:47,742 --> 00:44:49,907
-And for us!
-For them too, I'm afraid.

675
00:44:50,907 --> 00:44:53,324
Too bad we don't have
some mescaline to mix in.

676
00:44:53,325 --> 00:44:56,741
I thought about it. In the end
I only brought heroin, coke and pills.

677
00:44:56,742 --> 00:44:58,406
What a scatterbrain!

678
00:44:58,407 --> 00:44:59,865
But mescs were withdrawn in '86.

679
00:45:00,865 --> 00:45:02,489
They're making them in Valencia again.

680
00:45:02,490 --> 00:45:04,865
A friend of mine is selling them in Madrid.

681
00:45:05,865 --> 00:45:07,115
Just a minute.

682
00:45:08,115 --> 00:45:09,575
Oh! What a pity...

683
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:14,781
What a pity you didn't think
of buying some!

684
00:45:14,782 --> 00:45:18,781
-But you're totally anti-drugs!
-Mescs are different.

685
00:45:18,782 --> 00:45:21,114
People become talkative and affectionate.

686
00:45:21,115 --> 00:45:23,574
They'd be great for those guys.

687
00:45:23,575 --> 00:45:25,281
Well, and for these guys too.

688
00:45:25,282 --> 00:45:28,574
We have to entertain them,
so that they don't think.

689
00:45:28,575 --> 00:45:32,614
-Have they asked for any songs?
-No! Go figure!

690
00:45:32,615 --> 00:45:34,949
Musicals killed true cabaret!

691
00:45:39,949 --> 00:45:42,239
I've got some mescs.

692
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,240
-It was for our honeymoon.
-This is your honeymoon!

693
00:45:44,824 --> 00:45:47,614
I need scissors.

694
00:45:47,615 --> 00:45:49,157
Wait till I unwrap them.

695
00:45:50,157 --> 00:45:52,699
I have to do it properly.

696
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:54,240
They smell a bit, don't they?

697
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:59,324
I washed them as best I could,
but I was carrying them in my ass.

698
00:45:59,325 --> 00:46:01,031
-I don't mind.
-Neither do I.

699
00:46:01,032 --> 00:46:03,489
And I'm not going to drink.
Why did I make that promise?

700
00:46:03,490 --> 00:46:06,240
But the pills themselves shouldn't smell.

701
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:09,989
I wrapped them up really well
before I shoved them in.

702
00:46:09,990 --> 00:46:11,948
I've been a "mule" for years.

703
00:46:11,949 --> 00:46:13,989
Your ass is the safest way
to get across a border.

704
00:46:13,990 --> 00:46:15,574
I believe in the ass too!

705
00:46:15,575 --> 00:46:17,741
It's true, they hardly smell.

706
00:46:17,742 --> 00:46:19,489
They stink!

707
00:46:19,490 --> 00:46:22,699
Thank you so much.
We'll all chip in and pay him.

708
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:25,449
-Money couldn't pay for this.
-But we'll still pay him, miser!

709
00:46:25,450 --> 00:46:27,907
Whatever you want,
but I'd like you to tell me...

710
00:46:29,907 --> 00:46:32,239
As soon as I finish this
I'll tell you everything.

711
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:35,531
More or less, when will we get to Mexico?

712
00:46:35,532 --> 00:46:37,741
Just a moment.

713
00:46:37,742 --> 00:46:41,198
I'm starting to realize,
and right away I'm regretting it.

714
00:46:41,199 --> 00:46:42,741
-Then don't think!
-Exactly.

715
00:46:42,742 --> 00:46:45,574
Of course! You're amoral,
you've got no problem.

716
00:46:45,575 --> 00:46:49,364
I'm warning you. They'll ask me
and I'll have to tell them.

717
00:46:49,365 --> 00:46:51,198
You really like a mea culpa.

718
00:46:51,199 --> 00:46:55,031
-What about the pilots?
-The pilots shouldn't take anything.

719
00:46:55,032 --> 00:46:58,239
-It would do them good to relax a little.
-The girl's right.

720
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:00,948
OK, warn them about the mescaline.

721
00:47:00,949 --> 00:47:04,948
And tell Alex I haven't taken anything
and I feel terrible!

722
00:47:04,949 --> 00:47:08,989
More or less, when will we get to Mexico?

723
00:47:08,990 --> 00:47:11,449
We're not landing in Mexico.

724
00:47:11,450 --> 00:47:14,531
Don't tell me we were so drunk
we got on the wrong plane!

725
00:47:14,532 --> 00:47:17,406
-No, look...
-We just got married.

726
00:47:17,407 --> 00:47:20,239
We partied for three days
and came straight to the plane.

727
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:22,199
You didn't get on the wrong plane.

728
00:47:23,199 --> 00:47:25,240
This one "was" going to Mexico.

729
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:28,114
-And now it isn't?
-No.

730
00:47:28,115 --> 00:47:30,239
Have a drink and I'll explain.

731
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:35,781
A few years ago,
a passenger had a panic attack.

732
00:47:35,782 --> 00:47:38,741
-Any news?
-Not an empty runway in the whole country!

733
00:47:38,742 --> 00:47:41,699
Don't freak out.

734
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:43,364
-How's Joserra?
-Fine.

735
00:47:43,365 --> 00:47:45,741
He threw everything up
and now he's great.

736
00:47:45,742 --> 00:47:47,574
Giving orders like always.

737
00:47:47,575 --> 00:47:49,906
This Valencia cocktail is really good.

738
00:47:49,907 --> 00:47:53,074
Won't you try it, Alex?
It's nearly all juice.

739
00:47:54,074 --> 00:47:55,656
Someone has to stay sober.

740
00:47:55,657 --> 00:47:58,239
-Joserra's sober.
-All the more reason.

741
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:00,449
-You gay couples are so hetero.
-I'm not a gay couple!

742
00:48:00,450 --> 00:48:02,449
-Have some, and cut loose.
-Get off!

743
00:48:02,450 --> 00:48:03,890
I'm not going to cut loose with you!

744
00:48:05,824 --> 00:48:07,385
-What are you laughing at?
-Me? Nothing.

745
00:48:07,824 --> 00:48:08,906
What is it?

746
00:48:08,907 --> 00:48:13,449
I'm sorry, captain, it's funny to
see two strong men like you...

747
00:48:13,450 --> 00:48:16,114
talking about cutting loose,
Valencia cocktail...

748
00:48:16,115 --> 00:48:18,325
-May I?
-Of course.

749
00:48:22,325 --> 00:48:24,407
Thank you.

750
00:48:37,407 --> 00:48:41,782
To sum up, I'll always tell you the truth.

751
00:51:19,782 --> 00:51:22,325
-What's going on?
-Nothing.

752
00:51:24,325 --> 00:51:26,156
Come on.

753
00:51:26,157 --> 00:51:29,115
Take this.
Open your mouth.

754
00:51:39,115 --> 00:51:40,115
Drink.

755
00:51:47,115 --> 00:51:48,074
Go to sleep.

756
00:51:49,074 --> 00:51:49,865
Go to sleep.

757
00:51:53,865 --> 00:51:56,198
I slept already.

758
00:51:56,199 --> 00:51:58,324
-More.
-More?

759
00:51:58,325 --> 00:52:00,531
Go to sleep.

760
00:52:00,532 --> 00:52:03,782
Come on, go to sleep.

761
00:52:09,782 --> 00:52:11,364
A glass of Valencia cocktail, Mr. Mas?

762
00:52:11,365 --> 00:52:14,614
What makes you suppose all this is funny?

763
00:52:14,615 --> 00:52:17,449
It's always worked for us.

764
00:52:17,450 --> 00:52:18,989
Maybe we chose the wrong song.

765
00:52:18,990 --> 00:52:21,742
Is that how this company
deals with emergencies?

766
00:52:22,742 --> 00:52:24,531
We wanted to distract you.

767
00:52:24,532 --> 00:52:28,781
Let this be the last time that
you step on me and sit on my briefcase!

768
00:52:28,782 --> 00:52:30,742
A really good briefcase.

769
00:52:31,742 --> 00:52:34,365
-Norma, I suppose you don't...
-Yes, I do.

770
00:52:35,365 --> 00:52:38,324
-Just as well...
-I loved Valencia cocktail in the 80s.

771
00:52:38,325 --> 00:52:39,907
-Great!
-Let's see.

772
00:52:50,907 --> 00:52:53,865
Sweet, but with a hint of bitterness.

773
00:52:54,865 --> 00:52:55,865
Delicious!

774
00:52:56,865 --> 00:52:59,156
-I want one too.
-Of course.

775
00:52:59,157 --> 00:53:00,906
And I'm having another one.

776
00:53:00,907 --> 00:53:02,406
-And me.
-And me.

777
00:53:02,407 --> 00:53:02,907
Me too.

778
00:53:03,824 --> 00:53:06,989
I don't want to seem ungrateful,
or eccentric.

779
00:53:06,990 --> 00:53:08,325
Here.

780
00:53:09,325 --> 00:53:12,490
You're quite right, Mr. Mas.
We're grotesque.

781
00:53:13,490 --> 00:53:15,824
Norma, I'd like to make it up with you.

782
00:53:16,824 --> 00:53:19,031
I was very rude in the cockpit.

783
00:53:19,032 --> 00:53:22,156
We were all very upset.
There's nothing to forgive.

784
00:53:22,157 --> 00:53:24,948
I'm glad you've made it up because...

785
00:53:24,949 --> 00:53:27,531
you're one of our idols.

786
00:53:27,532 --> 00:53:29,489
Didn't you start at the time
of the nudie movies?

787
00:53:29,490 --> 00:53:30,948
At the end.

788
00:53:30,949 --> 00:53:33,406
I arrived in Spain
at the start of the 80s...

789
00:53:33,407 --> 00:53:35,531
with barely a shirt on my back.

790
00:53:35,532 --> 00:53:38,489
And that's how I posed
on the cover of Interviú.

791
00:53:38,490 --> 00:53:40,948
An historic issue,
according to the magazine.

792
00:53:40,949 --> 00:53:42,989
I can vouch for that.

793
00:53:42,990 --> 00:53:44,614
It sold throughout the world.

794
00:53:44,615 --> 00:53:47,156
And how did you get into bondage?

795
00:53:47,157 --> 00:53:50,449
-Ulloa!
-If you don't mind talking about it...

796
00:53:50,450 --> 00:53:52,614
God, no! At this stage!

797
00:53:52,615 --> 00:53:55,907
I was very young,
I was very confused.

798
00:53:56,907 --> 00:54:01,700
At times like that, a girl
should only listen to her own heart.

799
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:05,989
And after failing
as an actress and a singer...

800
00:54:05,990 --> 00:54:08,656
my heart was overflowing with hatred.

801
00:54:08,657 --> 00:54:09,177
Only natural.

802
00:54:09,865 --> 00:54:14,325
That was when I discovered that
I had a natural gift for something.

803
00:54:15,325 --> 00:54:16,990
A gift for dominating!

804
00:54:17,990 --> 00:54:20,325
I took the artistic name of Miss Take.

805
00:54:21,325 --> 00:54:23,364
Thank you.

806
00:54:23,365 --> 00:54:25,115
Error made Woman!

807
00:54:26,115 --> 00:54:30,574
And very soon
I had a faithful clientele of slaves.

808
00:54:30,575 --> 00:54:32,115
Unbelievable!

809
00:54:33,115 --> 00:54:38,781
In a few years I reached the highest level,
or the lowest, of human nature.

810
00:54:38,782 --> 00:54:42,115
And that gave me power.
A lot of power.

811
00:54:44,115 --> 00:54:49,741
I've got erotic videos of the 600
most important men in this country...

812
00:54:49,742 --> 00:54:55,198
from number one to number 600,
of every stripe and tendency.

813
00:54:55,199 --> 00:54:56,239
I'm very eclectic in that!

814
00:54:56,824 --> 00:55:00,741
600 men, on your own
and at the same time?

815
00:55:00,742 --> 00:55:02,531
Lord, no!

816
00:55:02,532 --> 00:55:07,741
I and a group of escorts
who work for me in my own agency.

817
00:55:07,742 --> 00:55:10,741
So you've got erotic videos of number 1?

818
00:55:10,742 --> 00:55:15,281
Yes. I've got several
of number 1, with yours truly.

819
00:55:15,282 --> 00:55:16,824
Who's number 1?

820
00:55:17,824 --> 00:55:19,864
The most important...
Work it out.

821
00:55:19,865 --> 00:55:21,406
The Prime Minister?

822
00:55:21,407 --> 00:55:23,406
Love, think a bit.

823
00:55:23,407 --> 00:55:25,614
A little bit higher.

824
00:55:25,615 --> 00:55:26,115
The King.

825
00:55:28,824 --> 00:55:29,864
Was that with bondage too?

826
00:55:30,824 --> 00:55:34,741
No. He has more traditional tastes.

827
00:55:34,742 --> 00:55:38,073
So you have been royally screwed...

828
00:55:38,074 --> 00:55:40,741
Yes. But I haven't said anything!

829
00:55:40,742 --> 00:55:45,656
But, of course, there's a security team
that sees, hears, and talks.

830
00:55:45,657 --> 00:55:46,865
And we screw them too...

831
00:55:47,865 --> 00:55:50,324
and tape them too, obviously...

832
00:55:50,325 --> 00:55:52,531
which gives us great security!

833
00:55:52,532 --> 00:55:55,156
Given the times we live in,
if those documents exist...

834
00:55:55,157 --> 00:55:57,948
sooner or later
they'll come to light because...

835
00:55:57,949 --> 00:55:59,990
-You've got a price.
-My life is the price!

836
00:56:01,990 --> 00:56:04,406
I think you're over-valuing that material.

837
00:56:04,407 --> 00:56:06,156
Why?

838
00:56:06,157 --> 00:56:08,907
The spy service over-values it too!

839
00:56:09,907 --> 00:56:13,531
They've broken into my house
several times, looking for my files.

840
00:56:13,532 --> 00:56:15,906
-Like Watergate.
-Exactly.

841
00:56:15,907 --> 00:56:18,406
But as you'll understand
they won't find them there.

842
00:56:18,407 --> 00:56:22,114
They're stored in a safe-deposit box
under another name.

843
00:56:22,115 --> 00:56:24,156
You're also well connected
with the Opus Dei.

844
00:56:24,157 --> 00:56:27,948
Yes, very well connected.
And with the Legionnaires too.

845
00:56:27,949 --> 00:56:30,948
In fact, I'm going to Mexico
to visit one of them...

846
00:56:30,949 --> 00:56:32,531
a very important man.

847
00:56:32,532 --> 00:56:34,948
I'm sure you know him.

848
00:56:34,949 --> 00:56:37,282
But don't ask me for names.

849
00:56:38,282 --> 00:56:40,281
I'm talking too much.

850
00:56:40,282 --> 00:56:41,906
Not at all!

851
00:56:41,907 --> 00:56:43,989
What did you put in this cocktail?

852
00:56:43,990 --> 00:56:45,948
-Well...
-No!

853
00:56:45,949 --> 00:56:47,656
-Small bottles of champagne...
-No!

854
00:56:47,657 --> 00:56:49,114
-A carton of orange juice...
-No!

855
00:56:49,115 --> 00:56:51,115
-A splash of gin...
-No!

856
00:56:52,115 --> 00:56:55,781
All mixed with an overdose of mescaline.

857
00:56:55,782 --> 00:56:57,531
Mescaline?

858
00:56:57,532 --> 00:56:58,490
Ass-packed...

859
00:57:00,490 --> 00:57:03,156
Did you get me drunk
and drug me so I'd talk?

860
00:57:03,157 --> 00:57:04,906
Absolutely not!

861
00:57:04,907 --> 00:57:07,239
How could I have trusted you!

862
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:13,199
We gave you mescaline
so that you'd feel better.

863
00:57:14,199 --> 00:57:18,074
Don't you notice that you're less prickly,
that you like people?

864
00:57:19,074 --> 00:57:21,324
Or that you're horny?
That's another effect.

865
00:57:21,325 --> 00:57:23,657
-Ow, shit!
-I'm horny!

866
00:57:34,657 --> 00:57:37,407
Hello.

867
00:57:39,407 --> 00:57:41,656
How are you?

868
00:57:41,657 --> 00:57:42,990
Watching Norma's monologue.

869
00:57:45,990 --> 00:57:47,699
May I sit down?

870
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:50,531
If you promise not to hit me.

871
00:57:50,532 --> 00:57:52,532
I promise.

872
00:58:00,532 --> 00:58:02,932
I wanted to tell you that
the only thing my father left me...

873
00:58:03,824 --> 00:58:05,742
was your cover on Interviú.

874
00:58:06,742 --> 00:58:10,157
-I still have it.
-Really?

875
00:58:12,157 --> 00:58:14,700
I saw very little of my father.

876
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:18,699
But I went to see him when he was dying.

877
00:58:18,700 --> 00:58:22,157
He was living in a filthy room,
there was nothing on the walls...

878
00:58:23,157 --> 00:58:25,575
except your cover on Interviú.

879
00:58:27,575 --> 00:58:29,490
Thank you.

880
00:59:11,490 --> 00:59:13,782
It all fits in!

881
00:59:14,782 --> 00:59:16,742
How does she do it?

882
00:59:21,742 --> 00:59:24,364
Is she asleep?

883
00:59:24,365 --> 00:59:26,990
She's a sleepwalker.
It's best not to wake her.

884
00:59:28,990 --> 00:59:31,364
Oh, darling, darling, darling...

885
00:59:31,365 --> 00:59:33,157
You're killing me, darling.

886
00:59:54,157 --> 00:59:55,075
Giddy up, pony!

887
01:00:02,490 --> 01:00:04,574
Oh... Yes, yes, yes.

888
01:00:04,575 --> 01:00:08,450
Slowly, darling, please!

889
01:00:13,450 --> 01:00:15,199
Excuse me.

890
01:00:16,199 --> 01:00:17,906
Excuse me!

891
01:00:17,907 --> 01:00:19,074
What?

892
01:00:20,074 --> 01:00:23,364
-The last question, I swear.
-What is it?

893
01:00:23,365 --> 01:00:26,115
Are you doing it from in front or behind?

894
01:00:29,115 --> 01:00:31,157
In front!

895
01:00:33,157 --> 01:00:34,865
Darling, don't hit me, please!

896
01:02:13,865 --> 01:02:16,657
I can't stand you.

897
01:02:19,657 --> 01:02:22,157
The only devout one
and the only one not screwing.

898
01:03:02,157 --> 01:03:03,990
What do you do?

899
01:03:04,990 --> 01:03:06,990
I'm a security adviser.

900
01:03:07,990 --> 01:03:10,365
I need someone to advise me...

901
01:03:11,365 --> 01:03:12,824
and to give me security.

902
01:03:14,824 --> 01:03:17,865
-Would you like to work for me?
-You don't know me.

903
01:03:19,865 --> 01:03:22,615
I know when I can trust a man.

904
01:03:36,615 --> 01:03:38,490
By the way...

905
01:03:39,490 --> 01:03:42,741
aren't you going to call your wife?

906
01:03:42,742 --> 01:03:44,198
What will I tell her?

907
01:03:44,199 --> 01:03:46,574
That you love her...

908
01:03:46,575 --> 01:03:48,365
and the kids.

909
01:03:51,365 --> 01:03:53,282
Go on.

910
01:04:03,282 --> 01:04:08,073
-Are we there yet?
-No, but you go to sleep.

911
01:04:08,074 --> 01:04:10,074
Take this.

912
01:04:11,074 --> 01:04:12,907
Go to sleep, baby...

913
01:04:13,907 --> 01:04:16,365
Take this.

914
01:04:20,365 --> 01:04:23,489
This was our wedding night.

915
01:04:23,490 --> 01:04:25,949
-Hello?
-Hi, love.

916
01:04:26,949 --> 01:04:29,699
-How are you?
-Fine, and you?

917
01:04:29,700 --> 01:04:32,324
-Have you landed already?
-No.

918
01:04:32,325 --> 01:04:35,699
I'm calling from the plane.
Are the kids there?

919
01:04:35,700 --> 01:04:39,281
Yes, fighting over the PlayStation
and driving me crazy.

920
01:04:39,282 --> 01:04:42,489
Carmiña is taking them
to the movies later.

921
01:04:42,490 --> 01:04:44,073
Let me speak to them.

922
01:04:44,074 --> 01:04:47,365
-Are you all right?
-Yes. I want to hear them.

923
01:04:48,365 --> 01:04:51,114
Kids, dad wants to hear you. Here.

924
01:04:51,115 --> 01:04:54,074
Hi, dad, mom says you want to hear us.

925
01:04:56,074 --> 01:04:59,614
I wanted to tell you that I love you
and don't hit your brother.

926
01:04:59,615 --> 01:05:01,295
He's bigger
and some day he'll flatten you.

927
01:05:01,865 --> 01:05:04,239
He hasn't got the balls.
I'm fed up!

928
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:07,614
I'll put him on.
He's here beside me, the dickhead!

929
01:05:07,615 --> 01:05:09,282
Hello.

930
01:05:10,282 --> 01:05:13,281
Hey! Give me the phone.

931
01:05:13,282 --> 01:05:14,948
Don't listen to them.

932
01:05:14,949 --> 01:05:18,115
Carmiña will take them to the movies
and give me some peace.

933
01:05:20,115 --> 01:05:22,281
I love you all very much.

934
01:05:22,282 --> 01:05:25,450
-Alex, are you sure there's nothing wrong?
-No.

935
01:05:26,450 --> 01:05:28,574
I love you too, Concha.

936
01:05:28,575 --> 01:05:31,239
I'm glad.
Call when you arrive.

937
01:05:31,240 --> 01:05:32,782
Kisses.

938
01:05:40,782 --> 01:05:44,406
-The ice bucket! At last!
-You won't believe what happened.

939
01:05:44,407 --> 01:05:46,407
Do this.

940
01:05:50,407 --> 01:05:51,489
Cum!

941
01:05:51,490 --> 01:05:54,032
I know what happened.
Pig! Slut!

942
01:05:56,032 --> 01:05:58,656
Things are getting lively!

943
01:05:58,657 --> 01:06:00,741
You let your hair down.
You look prettier.

944
01:06:00,742 --> 01:06:04,031
-I'm not a virgin anymore!
-Just like that?

945
01:06:04,032 --> 01:06:06,948
-With someone in "Economic" Class.
-My saints have gone crazy!

946
01:06:06,949 --> 01:06:09,198
-I'm going in...
-No...

947
01:06:09,199 --> 01:06:11,531
-I haven't cleaned it yet.
-That doesn't matter.

948
01:06:11,532 --> 01:06:13,699
I'll clean it, and clean myself.

949
01:06:13,700 --> 01:06:16,032
Listen! Bruna!

950
01:06:17,032 --> 01:06:20,364
You have to tell me about it, in detail.

951
01:06:20,365 --> 01:06:24,489
-What's wrong with you?
-You're talking to a heretic, so there.

952
01:06:24,490 --> 01:06:27,198
I like having a believer in the crew.

953
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:29,615
And even more so now.

954
01:06:30,615 --> 01:06:32,532
Norma...

955
01:06:49,532 --> 01:06:52,115
I have someone for you.

956
01:07:00,115 --> 01:07:02,574
-Yes?
-Who is this?

957
01:07:02,575 --> 01:07:05,741
Piedad? It's me!

958
01:07:05,742 --> 01:07:08,115
-Dad?
-How are you, love?

959
01:07:09,115 --> 01:07:12,239
-Fine.
-This is wonderful!

960
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:15,741
-I was thinking about you, dad.
-You were?

961
01:07:15,742 --> 01:07:20,198
I've just read online that the police
have gone into the Guadiana Bank...

962
01:07:20,199 --> 01:07:22,406
and confiscated everything.

963
01:07:22,407 --> 01:07:23,781
Yeah.

964
01:07:23,782 --> 01:07:26,824
And that the La Mancha airport
is a complete swindle.

965
01:07:27,824 --> 01:07:29,824
And they're blaming you directly.

966
01:07:30,824 --> 01:07:34,406
Yes, I knew it was about to blow up.

967
01:07:34,407 --> 01:07:38,490
That's why I had to clear out.
I'm talking to you from a plane.

968
01:07:39,490 --> 01:07:42,906
-I'm sorry, dad.
-Don't worry.

969
01:07:42,907 --> 01:07:45,450
I'm so delighted to hear you!

970
01:07:46,450 --> 01:07:49,741
Please forget what your mother
and I said when you left home.

971
01:07:49,742 --> 01:07:51,656
We just want to see you.

972
01:07:51,657 --> 01:07:53,741
I won't be able to, but your mother...

973
01:07:53,742 --> 01:07:57,281
She'll be thrilled if you call her.
She's changed a lot.

974
01:07:57,282 --> 01:08:00,781
I don't know, dad. If you were there,
it would be easier.

975
01:08:00,782 --> 01:08:02,824
But mom... She's impossible.

976
01:08:03,824 --> 01:08:07,364
I'm going to be away for several months.

977
01:08:07,365 --> 01:08:09,864
I'm not asking you to promise me anything,
but call your mother.

978
01:08:09,865 --> 01:08:12,324
Just give her a chance.
She's really changed!

979
01:08:12,325 --> 01:08:15,657
-I haven't.
-We love you as you are.

980
01:08:17,657 --> 01:08:20,741
-Let me think about it.
-Thank you.

981
01:08:22,741 --> 01:08:24,325
Goodbye, my love.

982
01:08:25,325 --> 01:08:27,449
'Bye, dad.

983
01:08:27,450 --> 01:08:29,574
Take care.

984
01:08:29,575 --> 01:08:31,700
You too.

985
01:08:38,700 --> 01:08:40,074
Thank you, Norma.

986
01:08:44,074 --> 01:08:46,074
Peninsula 2549.

987
01:08:48,074 --> 01:08:50,990
-Request for La Mancha airport approved.
-Acknowledged.

988
01:08:50,991 --> 01:08:54,531
Change to La Mancha frequency.

989
01:08:54,532 --> 01:08:57,700
Acknowledged.

990
01:09:02,700 --> 01:09:06,116
Tell me the truth.
Are they going to put me in jail?

991
01:09:08,116 --> 01:09:09,407
Yes.

992
01:09:10,407 --> 01:09:13,700
That's a good sign.
It means I'm going to survive.

993
01:09:14,700 --> 01:09:17,531
Forgive me for asking this...

994
01:09:17,532 --> 01:09:20,324
but have you killed a lot of people?

995
01:09:20,325 --> 01:09:20,825
No.

996
01:09:21,824 --> 01:09:26,365
I've swindled a lot in my lifetime
but I haven't killed anyone.

997
01:09:26,366 --> 01:09:28,824
-Why do you ask?
-Excuse me.

998
01:09:32,824 --> 01:09:34,740
-I've behaved very badly.
-Yes, terribly.

999
01:09:34,741 --> 01:09:36,781
Can you make this infusion for me?

1000
01:09:36,782 --> 01:09:39,615
-Do you feel ill?
-I want to retch.

1001
01:09:39,616 --> 01:09:41,531
You drank gallons of Valencia cocktail!

1002
01:09:41,532 --> 01:09:43,240
So what?

1003
01:09:43,241 --> 01:09:45,031
We've got a runway!

1004
01:09:45,032 --> 01:09:47,616
Prepare the briefing.
I'll be right back.

1005
01:09:55,616 --> 01:09:57,240
-Piluca...
-What can I get you?

1006
01:09:57,241 --> 01:10:00,531
-Nothing. Wake up.
-I'm awake.

1007
01:10:00,532 --> 01:10:05,240
-I'm Joserra, your colleague.
-Hello, Joserra.

1008
01:10:05,241 --> 01:10:08,031
Listen, we're going to land.
Wake the passengers.

1009
01:10:08,032 --> 01:10:10,905
-Where are we landing?
-In La Mancha, in an hour.

1010
01:10:10,906 --> 01:10:12,449
See to these girls.

1011
01:10:12,450 --> 01:10:14,574
-They'll want an explanation.
-Give it to them.

1012
01:10:14,575 --> 01:10:17,574
-What do I tell them?
-The truth, you drugged them.

1013
01:10:17,575 --> 01:10:19,700
OK.

1014
01:10:20,700 --> 01:10:22,449
Good news!

1015
01:10:22,450 --> 01:10:24,656
We've got a runway.

1016
01:10:24,657 --> 01:10:29,198
We'll land in about an hour
because we need time to jettison fuel...

1017
01:10:29,199 --> 01:10:31,198
and learn how to do the evacuation.

1018
01:10:31,199 --> 01:10:33,156
It's very easy.

1019
01:10:33,157 --> 01:10:36,324
-What's wrong, Bruna?
-Nothing.

1020
01:10:36,325 --> 01:10:40,198
Well, then?
Why that expression?

1021
01:10:40,199 --> 01:10:43,949
You should be happy.
You've just lost your virginity.

1022
01:10:44,949 --> 01:10:45,991
It's that...

1023
01:10:46,991 --> 01:10:48,906
What? Hurry up!

1024
01:10:49,906 --> 01:10:52,657
It stinks of death.

1025
01:10:54,657 --> 01:10:56,490
That's enough!

1026
01:10:56,491 --> 01:10:59,948
We're all scared shitless,
but we're trying to hide it.

1027
01:10:59,949 --> 01:11:01,829
So make an effort, please.
Or at least be quiet!

1028
01:11:02,824 --> 01:11:05,656
Let her talk, it'll just take a minute.

1029
01:11:05,657 --> 01:11:06,991
Go on, Bruna.

1030
01:11:07,991 --> 01:11:09,391
I've been smelling death for hours.

1031
01:11:11,824 --> 01:11:14,281
It began at the start of the trip, but...

1032
01:11:14,282 --> 01:11:16,656
I thought it was the farts.

1033
01:11:16,657 --> 01:11:19,156
I don't smell it everywhere.

1034
01:11:19,157 --> 01:11:22,700
In the cockpit, for example, no.

1035
01:11:23,700 --> 01:11:26,616
Not beside the phone.

1036
01:11:29,616 --> 01:11:31,532
Not beside the newlyweds.

1037
01:11:34,532 --> 01:11:36,032
Not beside you, Ricardo.

1038
01:11:40,032 --> 01:11:42,366
Not where the stewards are...

1039
01:11:44,366 --> 01:11:50,574
That only leaves Mr. Infante,
Norma and me.

1040
01:11:50,575 --> 01:11:52,699
It's me.

1041
01:11:52,700 --> 01:11:55,781
-What about you?
-I'm the one who stinks of death.

1042
01:11:55,782 --> 01:11:57,325
Yes!

1043
01:11:58,325 --> 01:12:00,656
I'm a hit man.

1044
01:12:00,657 --> 01:12:02,656
But aren't you a security adviser?

1045
01:12:02,657 --> 01:12:04,324
-That too...
-They go together.

1046
01:12:04,325 --> 01:12:08,574
-Have you killed a lot of people?
-Quite a few.

1047
01:12:08,575 --> 01:12:11,366
But the next job was going to be my last.

1048
01:12:12,366 --> 01:12:15,240
Well, I'm trying to get out
of my last job.

1049
01:12:15,241 --> 01:12:18,906
-How do you do that?
-By accepting the consequences.

1050
01:12:19,906 --> 01:12:23,198
I'll have to disappear for a while,
have my face operated on...

1051
01:12:23,199 --> 01:12:24,781
I know a surgeon!

1052
01:12:24,782 --> 01:12:28,740
I don't want to be a nuisance
but we're landing in 40 minutes.

1053
01:12:28,741 --> 01:12:30,532
-Am I your target?
-No.

1054
01:12:31,532 --> 01:12:33,282
Who hired you for the last job?

1055
01:12:34,282 --> 01:12:37,074
Mrs. Patricia Velázquez Vargas.

1056
01:12:39,074 --> 01:12:41,906
Is she the wife of the owner of Unimexa?

1057
01:12:43,906 --> 01:12:46,905
-The Mexican cell phone company?
-Yes.

1058
01:12:46,906 --> 01:12:49,906
What a coincidence!
Her husband is a client of mine.

1059
01:12:50,906 --> 01:12:53,740
I've got an appointment
with him now in Mexico City.

1060
01:12:53,741 --> 01:12:55,948
I'll tell him that his wife
shouldn't count on you.

1061
01:12:55,949 --> 01:12:57,406
And how will you tell him?

1062
01:12:57,407 --> 01:12:59,991
I'll phone him right now
and you can stop worrying.

1063
01:13:01,991 --> 01:13:04,157
Let me get past, darling.
I'm going to call him.

1064
01:13:06,157 --> 01:13:08,116
What's wrong with you?

1065
01:13:15,116 --> 01:13:17,366
Why are you looking at me like that?

1066
01:13:18,366 --> 01:13:18,886
What's wrong?

1067
01:13:19,866 --> 01:13:20,949
You're the target, Norma.

1068
01:13:21,949 --> 01:13:24,116
Patricia is obsessed
with having you killed.

1069
01:13:25,116 --> 01:13:26,116
Me?

1070
01:13:27,116 --> 01:13:30,240
But what have I done to that woman?
I don't even know her!

1071
01:13:30,241 --> 01:13:33,781
Maybe she doesn't approve of your
sadomasochistic practices with her husband.

1072
01:13:33,782 --> 01:13:36,905
The bitch!
Where were you thinking of doing it?

1073
01:13:36,906 --> 01:13:41,365
She wanted me to kill you in Marbella,
but I persuaded her it was safer in Mexico.

1074
01:13:41,366 --> 01:13:44,449
I wanted to gain time,
stop her hiring someone else.

1075
01:13:44,450 --> 01:13:46,990
I had a plan to help you escape in Mexico.

1076
01:13:46,991 --> 01:13:48,948
To help me escape? Why?

1077
01:13:48,949 --> 01:13:50,990
You're a professional killer.

1078
01:13:50,991 --> 01:13:53,240
Why would you risk your life
for someone like me?

1079
01:13:53,241 --> 01:13:55,324
Excuse me, I'll take this.

1080
01:13:55,325 --> 01:13:56,991
I don't kill women.

1081
01:13:57,991 --> 01:13:59,657
That's very good.

1082
01:14:05,657 --> 01:14:10,324
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen,
this is your Chief Steward speaking...

1083
01:14:10,325 --> 01:14:12,115
We're fully established
on final approach...

1084
01:14:12,116 --> 01:14:15,324
but we still have
40 tons of fuel to jettison.

1085
01:14:15,325 --> 01:14:18,866
Acknowledged.
Safety measures activated and ready.

1086
01:14:22,866 --> 01:14:25,700
Let's practice the safety position again.

1087
01:14:26,700 --> 01:14:29,198
Put your knees together...

1088
01:14:29,199 --> 01:14:31,281
separate your feet...

1089
01:14:31,282 --> 01:14:33,450
and lean forward.

1090
01:14:34,450 --> 01:14:38,240
In Business Class you can hold
your arms behind your legs.

1091
01:14:38,241 --> 01:14:41,906
We'll go over the safety position.
Pay attention, please!

1092
01:14:42,906 --> 01:14:44,990
Great.

1093
01:14:44,991 --> 01:14:46,781
We put our knees together...

1094
01:14:46,782 --> 01:14:49,699
separate our feet, cross our arms...

1095
01:14:49,700 --> 01:14:53,699
lean forward
and rest our heads on our arms.

1096
01:14:53,700 --> 01:14:56,699
You put your arms behind your legs.

1097
01:14:56,700 --> 01:14:57,990
That's it.

1098
01:14:57,991 --> 01:15:00,905
Ma'am... Wake up.

1099
01:15:00,906 --> 01:15:02,740
Cross your arms...

1100
01:15:02,741 --> 01:15:05,032
-No breakfast?
-You'd throw it up when we land!

1101
01:15:07,032 --> 01:15:11,241
Alex, you're bisexual.

1102
01:15:12,241 --> 01:15:15,406
Is it true guys suck your dick
better than girls do?

1103
01:15:15,407 --> 01:15:18,198
Why bring that up now, Benito?
Hold ECAM.

1104
01:15:18,199 --> 01:15:19,905
Hold ECAM.

1105
01:15:19,906 --> 01:15:23,282
While you were out, I let Ulloa...

1106
01:15:24,282 --> 01:15:25,824
And it was...!

1107
01:15:27,824 --> 01:15:30,073
Activate approach stage.

1108
01:15:30,074 --> 01:15:32,699
Stage activated and confirmed.

1109
01:15:32,700 --> 01:15:36,406
The truth is we ended up doing a 69.
I sucked him off as well.

1110
01:15:36,407 --> 01:15:38,740
He's skinny
but he's got one hell of a dick!

1111
01:15:38,741 --> 01:15:41,824
Do you think this is the time
to talk about Ulloa's dick?

1112
01:15:42,824 --> 01:15:44,824
Speed managed.

1113
01:15:45,824 --> 01:15:48,948
For me, it is important.
Am I becoming bisexual, like you?

1114
01:15:48,949 --> 01:15:50,324
No!

1115
01:15:50,325 --> 01:15:53,615
-You're a natural-born fag!
-Cut it out!

1116
01:15:53,616 --> 01:15:55,198
And your wife knows.

1117
01:15:55,199 --> 01:15:57,406
That's why she's obsessed
with you not doing it with guys.

1118
01:15:57,407 --> 01:15:59,157
Continue with ECAM!

1119
01:16:01,157 --> 01:16:04,741
-Crossfeed Selector on?
-Yes, Crossfeed open.

1120
01:16:05,741 --> 01:16:07,324
I think you're exaggerating.

1121
01:16:07,325 --> 01:16:09,615
It happened with Ulloa today
because I'd been drinking.

1122
01:16:09,616 --> 01:16:11,198
Pumps on unaffected side off.

1123
01:16:11,199 --> 01:16:12,949
Like when it happened with us.

1124
01:16:13,949 --> 01:16:17,198
That's why you threw up,
not because my dick made you retch.

1125
01:16:17,199 --> 01:16:18,990
You loved my dick!

1126
01:16:18,991 --> 01:16:21,240
But with the excuse of alcohol...

1127
01:16:21,241 --> 01:16:24,324
-Turn off the left side.
-I don't know what you're getting at.

1128
01:16:24,325 --> 01:16:27,324
-Oxygen crew supply off.
-Hold ECAM.

1129
01:16:27,325 --> 01:16:31,156
After you threw up, you went at it again
and asked me to screw you.

1130
01:16:31,157 --> 01:16:32,781
I told you I'd had enough playing around...

1131
01:16:32,782 --> 01:16:35,281
and I had to practically
pull my dick out of your mouth!

1132
01:16:35,282 --> 01:16:37,198
Does that answer your question?

1133
01:16:37,199 --> 01:16:39,198
Because we have to land
without full landing gear...

1134
01:16:39,199 --> 01:16:40,839
and I think we should try to concentrate!

1135
01:16:41,824 --> 01:16:44,324
Hold ECAM.

1136
01:16:44,325 --> 01:16:47,324
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

1137
01:16:47,325 --> 01:16:50,490
This is your captain, Alex Acero.

1138
01:16:50,491 --> 01:16:52,240
Due to a technical failure...

1139
01:16:52,241 --> 01:16:57,241
we are forced to make an emergency landing
in approximately ten minutes.

1140
01:16:59,241 --> 01:17:04,532
We are heading for La Mancha airport
where all the rescue teams are prepared.

1141
01:17:06,532 --> 01:17:12,741
I would ask you not to worry and to
follow the cabin staff's instructions.

1142
01:17:13,741 --> 01:17:15,740
Once we have landed...

1143
01:17:15,741 --> 01:17:19,241
the Peninsula Company
will take care of all your needs.

1144
01:17:20,241 --> 01:17:21,157
Thank you.

1145
01:17:22,157 --> 01:17:23,948
La Mancha Control Tower.

1146
01:17:23,949 --> 01:17:27,324
Peninsula 2549, 20 miles north.

1147
01:17:27,325 --> 01:17:29,365
Requesting clearance.

1148
01:17:29,366 --> 01:17:35,741
Peninsula 2549, you are cleared
for ILS approach to runway one zero.

1149
01:17:36,741 --> 01:17:41,157
QNH one zero one zero.
Notify final approach.

1150
01:17:42,157 --> 01:17:44,366
Fully established on final approach.

1151
01:17:46,366 --> 01:17:47,531
Acknowledged.

1152
01:17:47,532 --> 01:17:51,574
Cleared for landing on runway one zero.

1153
01:17:51,575 --> 01:17:54,948
Wind three zero zero zero eight.

1154
01:17:54,949 --> 01:17:58,073
Safety measures activated and prepared.

1155
01:17:58,074 --> 01:18:00,905
Peninsula 2549 acknowledging.

1156
01:18:00,906 --> 01:18:03,574
Cleared for landing on runway one zero.

1157
01:18:03,575 --> 01:18:06,741
Safety measures activated and prepared.

1158
01:18:07,741 --> 01:18:10,574
I'm missing one leg.
Let's see if it holds.

1159
01:18:10,575 --> 01:18:13,157
-Good luck.
-Ready for impact!

1160
01:19:20,157 --> 01:19:20,866
Come on!

1161
01:19:22,866 --> 01:19:24,991
Come on, baby! Jump!

1162
01:19:43,991 --> 01:19:45,656
Has it snowed?

1163
01:19:45,657 --> 01:19:49,656
-Where are we?
-I don't know, but we've arrived.

1164
01:19:49,657 --> 01:19:53,616
I've got a terrible hangover...

1165
01:19:54,616 --> 01:19:57,741
But why?
I didn't drink anything...

1166
01:19:58,741 --> 01:20:02,073
-May I speak to my wife?
-It's me, dad.

1167
01:20:02,074 --> 01:20:06,406
-Piti? You're at home!
-Yes, I'm with mom.

1168
01:20:06,407 --> 01:20:07,990
You've argued already.

1169
01:20:07,991 --> 01:20:10,490
Don't go, wait for me.
I'll be there soon.

1170
01:20:10,491 --> 01:20:13,531
We haven't argued.
The street is full of police.

1171
01:20:13,532 --> 01:20:15,365
Don't come, dad.

1172
01:20:15,366 --> 01:20:18,365
I'm on my way.
I want to see you.

1173
01:20:18,366 --> 01:20:20,741
I have to see you.

1174
01:20:21,741 --> 01:20:25,198
The first thing is surgery
and change of hair color. Both of us!

1175
01:20:25,199 --> 01:20:26,740
I'll miss my nose.

1176
01:20:26,741 --> 01:20:28,324
-Norma...
-Yes?

1177
01:20:28,325 --> 01:20:30,948
I think I might be interested
in some of your videos.

1178
01:20:30,949 --> 01:20:32,781
I'm willing to pay a considerable amount.

1179
01:20:32,782 --> 01:20:35,781
That's too bad, those videos don't exist.

1180
01:20:35,782 --> 01:20:38,241
It's true I've slept with
whom I've slept with...

1181
01:20:39,241 --> 01:20:40,740
but I never taped anything.

1182
01:20:40,741 --> 01:20:43,574
I just spread the rumor,
that was enough.

1183
01:20:43,575 --> 01:20:46,031
And was the conversation
with your assistant a farce too?

1184
01:20:46,032 --> 01:20:50,700
No, she thinks they're real,
and with time I ended up believing it.

1185
01:20:51,700 --> 01:20:53,449
I understand.

1186
01:20:53,450 --> 01:20:56,574
Well, good luck to both of you!

1187
01:20:56,575 --> 01:20:58,241
Likewise, Mr. Mas.

1188
01:21:30,241 --> 01:21:32,740
How did you know we were landing here?

1189
01:21:32,741 --> 01:21:36,700
After I spoke to you,
I rang a friend in air traffic control.

1190
01:21:38,700 --> 01:21:41,699
In the end she told me everything.

1191
01:21:41,700 --> 01:21:43,407
This time I wasn't lying.

1192
01:21:44,407 --> 01:21:46,325
No, not this time.

1193
01:21:52,325 --> 01:21:54,491
This is Alba's phone.

1194
01:21:56,491 --> 01:22:00,156
This is your case.
It's all battered.

1195
01:22:00,157 --> 01:22:02,991
I packed what I could
but everything's ruined...

1196
01:22:03,991 --> 01:22:05,656
especially my presents.

1197
01:22:05,657 --> 01:22:07,699
Thank you.

1198
01:22:07,700 --> 01:22:08,991
I saw her.

1199
01:22:09,991 --> 01:22:10,949
Alba?

1200
01:22:11,949 --> 01:22:14,532
She was getting into the ambulance.

1201
01:22:15,532 --> 01:22:18,491
She was wearing a shirt
and pants of yours.

1202
01:22:20,491 --> 01:22:23,325
It terrified me to think
I could end up like her.

1203
01:22:26,325 --> 01:22:27,824
Goodbye, Ricardo.

1204
01:22:29,824 --> 01:22:31,575
Ruth...

1205
01:22:34,575 --> 01:22:36,657
You'll never end up like Alba.

1206
01:22:37,657 --> 01:22:39,906
But I have to be careful.

1207
01:22:48,906 --> 01:22:50,325
This is Nasser.

1208
01:22:52,325 --> 01:22:54,324
I met him in the foam...

1209
01:22:54,325 --> 01:22:57,199
but we both feel
we've met before, don't we?

1210
01:22:58,199 --> 01:23:00,532
-Don't we?
-Yeah.

1211
01:23:04,532 --> 01:23:06,199
Where do I get my case?

1212
01:23:10,199 --> 01:23:13,406
That's the last time I give
the passengers sleeping pills.

1213
01:23:13,407 --> 01:23:15,699
I had nightmares because I wasn't relaxed.

1214
01:23:15,700 --> 01:23:18,531
Don't tell me.
It was Benito who convinced you.

1215
01:23:18,532 --> 01:23:20,699
You're totally unscrupulous.

1216
01:23:20,700 --> 01:23:23,073
At least you knew about it, we didn't!

1217
01:23:23,074 --> 01:23:24,656
Talking of Benito...

1218
01:23:24,657 --> 01:23:27,740
it turns out he sucked off Ulloa
and Ulloa sucked him.

1219
01:23:27,741 --> 01:23:29,656
-What!
-Benito likes me!

1220
01:23:29,657 --> 01:23:31,449
-And me!
-And me!

1221
01:23:31,450 --> 01:23:32,990
Did Ulloa tell you?

1222
01:23:32,991 --> 01:23:34,312
-Was he drugged?
-To the eyeballs.

1223
01:23:34,824 --> 01:23:38,406
I know when a man wants
the woman in me or the transvestite...

1224
01:23:38,407 --> 01:23:40,074
and he wanted the woman!

1225
01:23:41,074 --> 01:23:43,199
You've made me doubt, bitch!

1226
01:23:50,199 --> 01:23:52,198
-Where are we going?
-Where do you want to go?

1227
01:23:52,199 --> 01:23:53,699
To your place.

1228
01:23:53,700 --> 01:23:57,531
I swore that if we got out of this
I'd go and live with you.

1229
01:23:57,532 --> 01:23:59,948
Things are fine as they are.

1230
01:23:59,949 --> 01:24:03,574
I'm not being fair to you or to my wife.

1231
01:24:03,575 --> 01:24:05,740
Concha agrees with me
that things are fine as they are.

1232
01:24:05,741 --> 01:24:06,241
Concha?

1233
01:24:06,824 --> 01:24:09,240
-You two have talked about this?
-Of course!

1234
01:24:09,241 --> 01:24:11,781
Concha and I tell each other everything!

1235
01:24:11,782 --> 01:24:14,656
How else do you think
you and I could have lasted so long?

1236
01:24:14,657 --> 01:24:16,032
And she doesn't mind that we...?

1237
01:24:17,032 --> 01:24:19,365
With that temper she has!

1238
01:24:19,366 --> 01:24:22,281
I never thought she was
so generous, and so open!

1239
01:24:22,282 --> 01:24:24,449
She's very open.

1240
01:24:24,450 --> 01:24:27,699
She and Carmiña have adapted
very well to the situation.

1241
01:24:27,700 --> 01:24:28,781
-Carmiña?
-Yes.

1242
01:24:28,782 --> 01:24:30,906
She's adapted perfectly
to the situation too.

1243
01:24:32,906 --> 01:24:34,781
Concha and Carmiña?

1244
01:24:34,782 --> 01:24:36,282
What do you mean?

1245
01:24:37,282 --> 01:24:40,615
-You mean they're together?
-Isn't it perfect?

1246
01:24:40,616 --> 01:24:42,824
-Behind my back!
-It was to make your life easier.

1247
01:24:43,824 --> 01:24:46,156
You could have said something.
I feel ridiculous.

1248
01:24:46,157 --> 01:24:47,905
You never asked.

1249
01:24:47,906 --> 01:24:51,115
If you'd ever asked,
I'd have told you everything.

1250
01:24:51,116 --> 01:24:54,656
I've got no secrets from you.
Well, from you or from anyone!

1251
01:24:54,657 --> 01:24:57,700
Oh, captain!

1252
01:24:58,700 --> 01:24:59,824
Benito!

1253
01:25:05,824 --> 01:25:08,574
-Has anyone seen Benito?
-What do you want, Piluca?

1254
01:25:08,575 --> 01:25:12,198
-Have you seen Benito?
-The copilot is always first out.

1255
01:25:12,199 --> 01:25:13,824
I can't believe you don't know that.
