1
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,240
<i>Everything gets better</i>
<i>at night...</i>

2
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,160
<i>...even Yonkers.</i>

3
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:07,920
<i>There's no traffic,</i>
<i>no aggravation.</i>

4
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,280
<i>Nice.</i>

5
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,280
<i>I've been relieving Sanchez</i>
<i>for the last five years,</i>

6
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,840
<i>ever since she got back</i>
<i>from Iraq.</i>

7
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,760
<i>She's more of a man than all</i>
<i>the other guys</i>

8
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,720
<i>on the four-to-twelve</i>
<i>put together.</i>

9
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,940
<i>She's like a friend.</i>

10
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:58,160
<i>We share a vice.</i>

11
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,720
Hey.
Hey.

12
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,360
August 10th.
Did you go?

13
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,720
Check it out.

14
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,560
Here.

15
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,560
Sanchez:
Is that ever neat!

16
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,280
Self portrait.

17
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,000
Oh, you've got to
email me this.

18
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,540
Put it on my MySpace.

19
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:14,080
Hey, when you leaving?

20
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,520
In the morning.

21
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,160
You crazy?

22
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,120
Man, you should have
took a sick day,

23
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,000
come over to my place.

24
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,480
Me and Tina are going
to watch A&E.

25
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,760
They've got a son of Sam
documentary on,

26
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:24,280
being it's the anniversary
of when they caught him.

27
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:27,340
Nah. You're name's on the
schedule, you show up.

28
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:30,400
Hate it when the guard relieving
me is a no show.

29
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,380
Ain't right.

30
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:32,160
Screw that.

31
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,240
If I was going on my
vacation the next day,

32
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,620
I'd tell them all
to blow me.

33
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:39,000
Thought that's what
Tina was for.

34
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,320
So, what you hitting?

35
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:44,080
Definitely his boyhood
home.

36
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,120
Sure.

37
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,600
The juvie facility
they had him in.

38
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,000
Still there?

39
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:51,760
Yeah. Closed it in 2000,
but it's still there.

40
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,360
Definitely want to
see that.

41
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,820
What about the
church?

42
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:58,280
Yeah. Church
and the shed,

43
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:01,120
up in the hills.

44
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,520
Wow, Carl Marznap.
You're really doing it.

45
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,320
Now, one of these years
I'm going to go with you.

46
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,200
No. My trips are my own.
You know that.

47
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,680
Big Jim's going
to cali.

48
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,440
Hey, if you see
Jessica alba,

49
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,320
bang her for me.

50
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,120
Hollywood,
it's for faggots.

51
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:27,240
Going about 150 Miles
north of that shit hole.

52
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,000
Take plenty of pictures.

53
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,400
Go fuck yourself.

54
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:37,960
Jim: <i>I've been at post one 15 years almost.</i>

55
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,520
<i>I got job security.</i>

56
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:43,120
<i>Mostly because no one</i>
<i>wants my shift.</i>

57
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,600
<i>Most guards hate it</i>
<i>down here.</i>

58
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,000
<i>Down here you're</i>
<i>vulnerable.</i>

59
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,160
<i>A couple guards been robbed,</i>

60
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,960
<i>been two drive-by shootings.</i>

61
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,800
<i>And they all say it's</i>
<i>too lonely.</i>

62
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:59,840
<i>They go nuts after</i>
<i>a few weeks.</i>

63
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,800
<i>But not me.</i>

64
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,520
<i>I never get lonely.</i>

65
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,320
<i>I love it down here.</i>

66
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,520
<i>I had this doctor,</i>

67
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,420
<i>this little Jew fucker</i>
<i>the court made me see</i>

68
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:13,120
<i>after I got out of the</i>
<i>hospital,</i>

69
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:16,360
<i>said it wasn't no good</i>
<i>me being alone too much.</i>

70
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:21,400
<i>Said it was unhealthy.</i>

71
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,760
<i>I thought he was full</i>
<i>of shit.</i>

72
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,440
<i>I mean, the world's all</i>
<i>fucked up</i>

73
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:29,640
<i>because nobody ever gets a</i>
<i>chance to be alone anymore.</i>

74
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,280
<i>You got your emails,</i>

75
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:35,160
<i>answering machines,</i>
<i>personal computers,</i>

76
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,040
<i>you always got someone</i>
<i>up your ass.</i>

77
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,160
<i>Makes people crazy.</i>

78
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:43,680
<i>You have none of that shit</i>
<i>down at post one.</i>

79
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:47,200
<i>It's why I like it</i>
<i>down here.</i>

80
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,440
<i>It's quiet.</i>

81
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:52,880
<i>Gives you plenty of</i>
<i>think time.</i>

82
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:00,800
<i>The morning rush...</i>

83
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,600
<i>A long line of people</i>
<i>going to their deaths.</i>

84
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,120
Morning, sunshine.

85
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,960
<i>I know they hate their lives.</i>

86
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:10,200
<i>We're all caught in</i>
<i>the same trap.</i>

87
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,200
You. Hey, hey, hey.

88
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,720
God, you got to get your window
fixed. Come on.

89
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,240
People aren't going to think
you have a job.

90
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,920
Get out of here.

91
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,760
<i>They're all sluts,</i>

92
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,400
<i>drug addicts,</i>

93
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,600
<i>whoremongers,</i>

94
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,280
<i>child molesters.</i>

95
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,720
<i>I know they hate me.</i>

96
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,840
<i>They hate all</i>
<i>the guards.</i>

97
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:31,520
Grumpy. Come on, grumpy.
Get up here.

98
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,080
Come on!

99
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:35,040
<i>I've been at this way too long</i>
<i>not to know that.</i>

100
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,400
All right, have
a great day.

101
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,480
<i>You see, they don't</i>
<i>trust us.</i>

102
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:39,200
Look at you.

103
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,600
You're the sunshine
in my day.

104
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,720
<i>They think we're going</i>
<i>through their desks</i>

105
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:43,520
<i>and offices at night</i>

106
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,640
<i>when they go home and</i>
<i>they're right. We are.</i>

107
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:49,800
<i>We are worse than what they're</i>
<i>paying us to keep out.</i>

108
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,320
<i>So, for thirty seconds</i>
<i>each day,</i>

109
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:56,120
<i>we all pretend we're</i>
<i>buddies.</i>

110
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:02,760
This new cook?

111
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:03,640
Waitress:
Yeah?

112
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,360
Jim: Every day this week,
too many onions.

113
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,080
When's Petey getting back
from Atlantic city?

114
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,560
Be back Friday,

115
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,960
degenerate gambler
that he is.

116
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,280
Packed yet?

117
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,280
You know me, ma.

118
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,680
I've been packed for
two weeks.

119
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:19,400
California, right?

120
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,400
Yeah, little town called
Hatticomb.

121
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,320
It's in, like,
farm country.

122
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,760
Farm country.

123
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,900
This guy was a, uh,

124
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,040
mass murderer arsonist.

125
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,340
Oh, lovely.
Yeah.

126
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:33,440
Fucking awesome.

127
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,140
Oh, great,
Carl Marznap.

128
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:36,910
Burned down a church
in '68,

129
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:38,480
killed a bunch of
people.

130
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,800
What the hell's
wrong with people?

131
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,240
Well, this guy was
gang raped as a kid.

132
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,080
That'll fuck you up,
ma.

133
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:53,040
I don't get what you do.
Well...

134
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,960
You know? It's...

135
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,320
It's very macabre to me.
Yeah?

136
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:57,920
Yeah, macabre.

137
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,480
What about those people that
go to the grassy knoll?

138
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,200
What about 'em?

139
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,760
To see where Kennedy's
head exploded.

140
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:05,600
He was the president.

141
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:08,360
And somehow, that's
not weird.

142
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:12,000
But what I do is.

143
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:13,960
I don't know.

144
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,360
Maybe you're right.

145
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,480
I mean, I went
to Graceland.

146
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,040
Same thing.
Same thing.

147
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,400
He died on the shitter.

148
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,840
He died on the shitter?
Mm-hmm.

149
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,640
Did they take
pictures?

150
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:26,520
Absolutely.
No.

151
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,680
I don't understand that.

152
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:37,440
Is that Jean Nate?

153
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,840
You always smell
so good.

154
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,440
Thank you,
sweetie.

155
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,000
Just take care
of yourself.

156
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,680
Make sure that wherever
you're staying,

157
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,440
you go down by the pool,

158
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,680
relax.
Yeah.

159
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,920
What do you want me
to bring you back?

160
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,400
I'll trust you.

00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:01,120
I'm going to get that
sundae going for you.

162
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,560
Just be careful.

163
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,760
Thank you.

164
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:14,040
Yes, please.

Jim: <i>You never took me to ballgames,</i>

<i>only cemeteries.</i>

167
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,420
<i>You said they were peaceful.</i>

168
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:33,600
<i>We hardly ever spoke.</i>

169
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,480
<i>I didn't care. I just</i>
<i>liked being with you.</i>

170
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:40,280
<i>You put something in</i>
<i>my blood, pop.</i>

171
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:44,200
<i>You made me a</i>

clerk with accent: Mr. Tanner,
the room is $49 a day, very clean.

183
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,880
My sister-in-law Olga
cleans herself.

184
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,800
I hope you got
air conditioning.

185
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,120
It's hot as hell
out there.

186
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,160
Yes. Yes, yes, cool.

187
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,200
Nice place at night.

188
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,360
Good to hide.

189
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,900
I'm on vacation.

190
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:20,200
How long you stay?

191
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,920
Four nights.

192
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:27,240
Got something by
the pool?

193
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,120
Here is your key. Room 21.
We have no pool,

194
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,960
but it's good to look
at the beautiful,

195
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:37,440
pretty girls anyway.
Enjoy.

Jim:
<i>The place is a dump.</i>

197
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,000
<i>But I like it.</i>
<i>It's cheap.</i>

<i>There's better ways to spend</i>

<i>When you came to grimes,</i>

218
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:50,360

Okay, here's your lovely

227
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,780
Chicken and a burger.

228
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:38,600
Looks great,
thank you.

229
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,840
Good?
Okay.

230
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:44,680
I guess you must have
really liked that.

231
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,240
You sure polished that
off in a hurry.

232
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,840
Uh, yeah. My father,

233
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:56,200
he always said "life's short,
so eat quick."

234
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,800
He died of indigestion.

235
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,800
Okay.

236
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,560
Can I get you some
dessert?

237
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,080
Yeah.
Yeah?

238
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:09,320
I think there was
something...

239
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,240
The Ventura volcano?

240
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,200
Okay.

241
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,140
Sounds like suicide
by dessert.

242
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:16,080
It is. I hope you
got room for it.

243
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,460
Well, I always got room.

244
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:20,840
I am a bottomless void.

245
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,360
Oh, you know what?

246
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:26,400
That guy was one of our
more notorious citizens.

247
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,520
You want some more
coffee?

248
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,240
Uh, sure.

249
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,880
Yeah?
Okay. I'll be back.

250
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,400
Um, une volcano.
Okay.

251
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:36,960
Por favor.

Waitress #2:
Can I get a whiskey down with fries?

253
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:43,800
Jim: I was in the bookstore
up the street and I saw this.

254
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,120
I never heard of him.
I figured I'm here,

255
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:49,420
I might as well...
Seems interesting.

256
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:51,520
Oh, yeah. He was
interesting all right.

257
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,240
You know, we get a lot of
people coming through here,

258
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,680
going to the places where
he killed people.

259
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:58,760
And also, the teenagers
like to go to that shack,

260
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,440
where he killed himself.

261
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,920
You know,

262
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:05,440
I don't get it why people
like to go to those places.

263
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:08,020
I mean, what kind of
sick thrill

264
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:10,600
do they get by doing that,
you know?

265
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,600
I don't know about
those things.

266
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:13,800
No.

267
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,740
I do know that people like
to go to ground zero.

268
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:19,680
Yeah, I know. I think
that's really sick too.

269
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:23,520
Hey, you should come back
for breakfast,

270
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:26,960
'cause it's much better
than our dinners. Okay?

271
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:29,960
I'm going to go get
your sundae.

272
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,840
Waitress:
Okay...

273
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:05,640
Woman: Call me when you get to
walnut and erbes, all right?

274
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,280
No, no.

275
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,200
Walnut and erbes.

276
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,840
..."e-r...

277
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:14,320

Yeah.

278
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:18,840
No. "E-r-b-e-s."

279
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:23,000
Go in, baby.
I'll be right there.

280
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,400
Hold on.

281
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:30,840
Go in. I'll be right there.
Just let me finish this.

282
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:34,160
That's my door.

283
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:37,280
Oh. This is
yours?

284
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:41,320
I thought you were
someone else.

285
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:41,920
Well, sorry.

286
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:44,860
All right. Call me
when you get there, papi

287
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:47,800
and then I'll give you
my address. Later.

288
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,960
You section eight?

289
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,400
Excuse me?

290
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:55,000
Are you section eight
housing

291
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,600
or are you, like,
visiting?

292
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,300
Uh, visiting.

293
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,000
Oh, okay.

294
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,800
Later.

Jim:
<i>Whores...</i>

<i>This place is teaming</i>

297
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,160
<i>I love these preachers.</i>

300

<i>to see where this man of God</i>

<i>The spot where Carl killed</i>

<i>...and I haunt you, Carl.</i>

<i>Jim: "It was at the modest
family home in Hatticomb,</i>

306
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,840
<i>where Carl's father would tie</i>
<i>him to a bed</i>

307
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:37,320
<i>and beat him viciously</i>
<i>with a razor strap,</i>

308
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,320
<i>sometimes burning his genitals</i>
<i>with lit candles</i>

317
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,320
<i>'the most thrilling event</i>
<i>in his life.'</i>

318
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:08,660
<i>he had been so excited by the</i>
<i>sight of his parents burning</i>

319
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:13,000
<i>that he... ejaculated for the</i>

320
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:18,600
<i>Carl, Carl, Carl...</i>

321
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:01,160
<i>You had no remorse for</i>
<i>what you did, did you Carl?</i>

322
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:03,560
<i>Of course you didn't.</i>

323
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:08,440
You used to say you didn't even
<i>know what remorse felt like.</i>

324
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,520
<i>How could you...</i>

325
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,480
<i>After what they did</i>
<i>to you?</i>

326
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:36,000
Jim: <i>What the fuck happened to me out there?</i>

327
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:40,480
<i>Fuck up. I hope the shit</i>
<i>hasn't started up again.</i>

328
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,580
<i>Not fucking now,</i>

329
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:44,680
<i>not here.</i>

330
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:10,280
<i>Why is it always like this</i>
<i>when I split town?</i>

331
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,080
<i>God, what is it about a man</i>
<i>being alone in a hotel room</i>

332
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:17,000
<i>that makes him want to just do</i>
<i>the most depraved shit?</i>

333
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,720
<i>This fucking whore working</i>
<i>out of the room next door...</i>

334
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:37,480
<i>The devil is just</i>
<i>tempting me.</i>

335
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:42,680
<i>It's one of them itches,</i>

336
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:46,200
<i>the more you scratch it,</i>
<i>the more it fucking itches.</i>

337
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,960
Woman:
I love it. Do it.

338
00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:00,840
You're a naughty boy,
aren't you?

339
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,480
Ooh, fuck!
Ooh, ooh!

340
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:16,320
Oh, my fucking God!

341
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:26,160
<i>"In 1961, after a five-year</i>
<i>spree of arson and murder,</i>

342
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:29,940
<i>Marznap goes into an extended</i>

346
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:44,680
<i>"It and its congregation</i>

347
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:07,660
Yeah! Harder!

348
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:10,330
Yes! Yes!
Yes!

349
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:13,000
Oh! Don't stop!

350
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,920
You fucking whore.

351
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:59,080
Jim:
<i>Maybe I should change rooms.</i>

352
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,200
<i>I don't...</i>

353
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:03,920
<i>I don't like being next</i>
<i>to that filthiness.</i>

354
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:12,040
<i>It's not good for me.</i>

355
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:17,880
So, you took my advice and you
came back for breakfast?

356
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:21,520
Hey, are you okay?

357
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:24,480
Yeah. Um...

358
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:28,800
My sister...

359
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,840
She's only 28 and she was
just diagnosed with cancer.

360
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:33,600
Oh...

361
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,920
They've given her
three months, tops.

362
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,700
Oh, lord.

363
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:39,480
I'm so sorry.

364
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:49,600
I lost my husband about
a few years ago

365
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:52,200
and, um...

366
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:57,160
I thought it was going
to kill me.

367
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,880
But it gets better.

368
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:05,640
I'm sorry for
your loss.

369
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,000
Thank you.

370
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,280
Man:
Excuse me, ma'am.

371
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:12,160
Um, I'll be right there,
okay?

372
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:15,480
God damn.

373
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:21,280
Can I get you anything?

374
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:24,680
No.

375
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:29,320
Okay.

376
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:34,720
I'm a, uh, friend of
Bill W's.

377
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:39,200
I saw your necklace.

378
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,800
Do you know where there might
be a meeting tonight?

379
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,560
Yeah, there's one at the
community church

380
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,560
at eight o'clock.

381
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:49,880
That's on Polly street.

382
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:57,280
Uh... I'm Carl.

383
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:00,360
Hi, Carl.
I'm Betsy.

384
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:08,880
Okay. I'm going to
get you some coffee, okay?

385
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:16,680
Jim: <i>Seems like a nice person.</i>
<i>Shouldn't have lied to her.</i>

386
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,380
<i>But the truth has never</i>
<i>gotten me anywhere.</i>

387
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:22,080
<i>So what if I don't</i>
<i>have a sister?</i>

388
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:22,880
<i>That's not important.</i>

389
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:25,080
<i>The bottom line is</i>
<i>i got pain.</i>

390
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:27,800
<i>I got pain and she's</i>
<i>got pain.</i>

391
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,200
<i>The important thing is</i>
<i>our grief touched.</i>

392
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:51,040
<i>April 14th 1968,</i>

393
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:55,360
<i>your masterpiece.</i>

394
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:08,360
<i>I can feel you.</i>

395
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,440
<i>Where are you?</i>

396
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:38,960
There was only three doors,
you know?

397
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:47,160
There was that one there.

398
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:54,640
There was these two here.

399
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:05,520
Took me two minutes

400
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:08,680
to lock them all
in here.

401
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:21,560
I had it fully burning
in eight.

402
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,800
Most of them they...

403
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,920
they trampled each others
in the panic.

404
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:37,680
"Ah!"

405
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,400
My old man...

406
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:48,960
He was one of the
church elders.

407
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:03,280
Everybody knew

408
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:06,440
what he was doing
to me.

409
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:18,680
Oh, but nobody helped me
a shit.

410
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:22,220
Mm...

411
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:24,960
Mmm...

412
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:29,240
I taught all these
phony sons of bitches

413
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:34,080
what being a victim
felt like.

414
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:46,960
I think it's time...

415
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:52,400
That you taught someone
that sermon.

416
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:46,160
Woman: There was a man and he
was sprawled out on the bed, naked.

417
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:48,080
We had had sex.

418
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,220
I was still so drunk,

419
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:52,150
I called my husband.

420
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:54,535
I gave him the address.

421
00:35:54,735 --> 00:35:56,920
He came and got me.

422
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:02,240
That was my bottom.

423
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:07,400
I cried for about three weeks
after he left.

424
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:11,580
He took my kids with him.

425
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:14,600
But somehow I found a room,

426
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,840
August 5th, 1998.

427
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:21,880
I'm one of the lucky ones.
We're all lucky.

428
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:25,740
We've all found rooms.

429
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:29,400
...and he was on the couch

430
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:33,080
and he had been watching
a ballgame.

431
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:40,520
Arrhythmogenic right
ventricular dysphasia.

432
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:44,200
The first symptom of that
is sudden death.

433
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:48,420
He was a vegetarian.

434
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:50,880
He was a runner.

435
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:54,480
He was in perfect health.

436
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:59,720
And he was dead at 45,

437
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:02,920
just like that.

438
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:07,040
And it's been four years.

439
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:13,240
But...

440
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,760
I don't know.

441
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,560
It feels like it
was yesterday.

442
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:20,520
And I think I'm actually
more distraught now

443
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:21,600
than I was then.

444
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:25,160
I mean, at least then
I was in shock.

445
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:27,200
You know?

446
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,560
And now the pain...

447
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,920
Just never goes away.

448
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:41,920
So, I know what you're
going through, Carl.

449
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,260
I'm sorry.

450
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:47,950
That's...

451
00:37:50,275 --> 00:37:52,200
It's okay.

452
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:57,880
I'm glad you came...

453
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:00,440
...to the meeting.

454
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:07,140
I needed, uh...

455
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:11,360
I don't know.

456
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:15,840
Lately, I can't...

457
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:18,080
I don't know what's
going on.

458
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:21,760
I just...

459
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:24,920
I don't even know
what's real.

460
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:31,240
I know.
I feel like that too.

461
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:36,040
Sometimes I don't know
whether I'm coming or I'm going.

462
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:43,880
But I fight through it
and I go to a meeting.

463
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,880
Because in the end, Carl,

464
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:54,600
the only thing that's real
is right now.

465
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,640
This, you know?

466
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:59,440
Connecting with people.

467
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,880
I thank God for my job.

468
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:06,440
I thank God
for these meetings.

469
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:08,760
Because without them,

470
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:12,200
I'm not sure
what I would do.

471
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:21,040
Hmm, anyway.

472
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:24,680
I haven't even asked you
where you're from.

473
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:28,040
Where are you from,
Carl?

474
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:29,880
Uh...

475
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,880
I'm from Yonkers.

476
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,560
It's in New York.

477
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:39,600
Oh.

478
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,680
Is it nice?

479
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,160
No.

480
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,240
No?
No.

481
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,040
It's...

482
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:50,360
It's not nice.

483
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,040
It's...

484
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,640
It's Yonkers.

485
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,040
So are you...

486
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,280
Here on business,

487
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:07,200
or are you
just passing through?

488
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:12,960
I mean, I say that because
Hatticomb is the kind of place

489
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:15,560
that you just go through,
not to.

490
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,720
You know?

491
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:24,800
You smell good.

492
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,480
Hmm.

493
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:35,240
Are you hungry?

494
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,720
So, what do you do?

495
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:41,080
Jim:
I'm a security guard.

496
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,520
What else?

497
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,580
What do you want
to know?

498
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:46,640
Well, what songs
do you like?

499
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,800
Um...

500
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,240
Polka music.

501
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,960
Okay.

502
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,720
You laugh a lot.

503
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:57,940
I know.

504
00:40:58,140 --> 00:40:58,960
I'm sorry.

505
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:01,560
Why are you sorry?

506
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:04,200
You're beautiful,
you know that?

507
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,280
Thank you.

508
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:08,800
~ Suzanne takes you down

509
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,180
~ to her place
near the river ~

510
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:15,360
~ you can hear
the boats go by ~

511
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:19,740
~ and you can spend the night
beside her ~

512
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:23,630
~ and you know
that she's half crazy ~

513
00:41:23,830 --> 00:41:27,495
~ but that's why
you want to be there ~

514
00:41:27,695 --> 00:41:31,360
~ and she feeds you
tea and oranges ~

515
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:32,480
hmm, W.T.?

516
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:35,520
I thought you were
recovering.

517
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,760
One vice at a time.

518
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:41,440
Sorry.

519
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:44,520
Your turn.

520
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:48,040
It's very strong.

521
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,720
You like it?

522
00:41:58,120 --> 00:41:59,600
No? Oh. I do.

523
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:02,420
~ And you want
to travel with her ~

524
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:05,040
~ and you want
to travel blind ~

525
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:09,000
~ and you know
that she will trust you ~

526
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:12,960
~ for you've touched
her perfect body ~

527
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:15,440
~ with your mind

528
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,440
What?

529
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:23,800
Thank you.

530
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:27,820
~ When he walked upon
the water ~

531
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:31,720
~ and he spent
a long time watching ~

532
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:36,120
~ from his lonely
wooden tower ~

533
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:39,560
~ and when he knew
for certain ~

534
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:42,880
~ only drowning men
could see him ~

535
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:47,720
~ he said "all men
will be sailors then ~

536
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:51,520
~ until the sea
shall free them" ~

537
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:54,120
~ but he himself
was broken ~

538
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:58,720
~ long before
the sky would open ~

539
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:02,240
~ forsaken, almost human

540
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:06,320
~ he sank beneath
your wisdom ~

541
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:09,160
Oh, yeah.

542
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:17,600
~ And you want
to travel with him ~

543
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:18,720
here. Kiss me.

544
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:21,400
~ And you want
to travel blind ~

545
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:26,320
~ and you think maybe
you'll trust him ~

546
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:29,360
stop. Just don't kiss me, okay?

547
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:30,580
Just...

548
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:31,600
Why?

549
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:32,560
Because...

550
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:34,880
Because I'm not
your boyfriend.

551
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:36,640
All right?

552
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:38,920
I don't like
all that mushy shit.

553
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:40,260
I just want to fuck.

554
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:41,600
Okay, wait a minute.

555
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:42,400
Hey, hey.

556
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:45,080
Carl, goddamn it.
Come on.

557
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:46,400
Don't be so rough.

558
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:48,680
God...
Don't call me that.

559
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:50,320
"Carl"?

560
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:54,080
Jesus Christ.

561
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,720
What is wrong
with you, Carl...?

562
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:59,660
Fucking don't call me that!

563
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:01,600
You don't fucking know me!

564
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:06,280
Fucking little bitch.
Jesus Christ.

565
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:06,760
Real women don't get
your nut off anymore.

566
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:14,360
I know the feeling.

567
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:18,680
There's poison
in you there.

568
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:22,080
Its sex all backed up.

569
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:24,360
Infected.

570
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:27,560
Got to come out.

571
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:32,960
But you always lettin' it
build up.

572
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:35,840
No good.

573
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:45,440
Go ahead, boy.

574
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:50,040
Get it out.

575
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:55,680
Knock.

576
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:58,560
Knock on that door there.

577
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:14,600
Get in there,
damn it.

578
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:25,960
Woman:
Hi.

579
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:30,480
You know what I am?

580
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:37,920
You know, you're supposed
to make an appointment first.

581
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:42,000
But since we're neighbors,

582
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:44,800
I can squeeze you in.

583
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,400
Kiss me.

584
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:10,560
I... I don't...

585
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:14,680
You a cop,
asshole?

586
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:18,040
No.

587
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:21,560
Then give me a kiss
or get out.

588
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:38,800
On my neck,
not the mouth.

589
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:54,680
Cops ain't allowed
to touch.

590
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:17,080
What's that?
It's a donation.

591
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:56,440
What's your name?

592
00:48:57,320 --> 00:48:59,040
Carl.

593
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:03,040
I'm iris.

594
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:12,960
You don't want
to suck 'em?

595
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:15,780
Hmm?

596
00:49:15,980 --> 00:49:17,750
You can.

597
00:49:17,950 --> 00:49:19,720
Go ahead.

598
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:34,080
Suck 'em.

599
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:36,480
Make me.

600
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:52,320
What the fuck is that, hmm?

601
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:54,240
I said suck 'em.

602
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:58,160
You want me to make you?
You want me to make you, hmm?

603
00:49:58,360 --> 00:50:00,160
I said suck 'em.

604
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:05,240
That's right.
Fucking suck 'em.

605
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:10,080
Mmm.

606
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:22,720
Are you sure
you want this?

607
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:29,440
Then take your clothes off
and lay down.

608
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:48,440
I want to get a rubber.

609
00:51:53,740 --> 00:51:55,840
Does that feel good, Carl?

610
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:10,640
Boy 1:
Drag him over here.

611
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:15,520
Get him!
Boy 2: Hold him down!

612
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:17,320
Boy 1:
Make sure no one's coming.

613
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:21,280
Young Jim:
Get off me!

614
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:25,680
Let me go!

615
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:28,800
Boy 1:
Get his pants off.

616
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:29,320
Ow! Ow!

617
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:31,640
Boy 1:
Now stick it in there.

618
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:32,800
Shove it up his ass.

619
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:35,200
Ow! Ow!

620
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:38,400
Boy 1:
You like that, you fag?

621
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:41,280
I know you like that, Carl.

622
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:08,920
Motherfuckers.

623
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:10,880
They ruined me.

624
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:14,880
Those fucking kids
broke everything.

625
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:18,560
I know, Jimmy.
I know.

626
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:20,320
They broke me too.

627
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:23,000
Why didn't they
fix me?

628
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:26,880
They could've fixed me.

629
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:27,720
I was just a kid.

630
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:30,200
How could they not
even try?

631
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:34,200
Now it's too fucking late.

632
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:37,280
I know, Jimmy.

633
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:39,280
There ain't a soul alive

634
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:41,080
on this miserable planet

635
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:44,680
that don't know how
to break this shit up,

636
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:46,480
pound it into powder

637
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:50,840
like they did
to you and me.

638
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:55,360
Yeah.

639
00:53:57,120 --> 00:54:00,520
We closer than kin
that way.

640
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:55,280
Woman 1:
<i>What are you doing?</i>

641
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:56,640
Man 1:
<i>Nice place to hide.</i>

642
00:54:56,840 --> 00:54:58,200
Man 2:
What are you doing in my house?

643
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:00,320
Woman 2: <i>Yeah, you know,
I think that's really sick too.</i>

644
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:03,080
Man 3:
<i>It's time that you taught that sermon.</i>

645
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:05,440
Woman 3:
<i>Go down by the pool...</i>

646
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:07,560
Man 3:
<i>There's poison in there.</i>

647
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:09,640
Woman 4:
<i>He is such a pig.</i>

648
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:56,040
Um, I know that we were both
a little high.

649
00:55:56,840 --> 00:55:59,620
And sometimes
people get weird.

650
00:55:59,820 --> 00:56:02,400
You know,
I just wanted to say

651
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:04,320
that if I make you
feel uncomfortable,

652
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:07,200
or if I came on
too strong...

653
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:11,440
I'm sorry.

654
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:12,640
I guess I...

655
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:16,240
I know that my sense
of hospitality

656
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:17,960
just get away from me.

657
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:22,240
But it's just because
I really like you.

658
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:30,760
You're disgusting.

659
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:46,840
Waitress:
Betsy, are you okay?

660
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:04,440
Woman:
Hey, sweetie. It's aunt Vee.

661
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:06,680
I just wanted
to be the first person

662
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:09,160
to wish you
a Happy Birthday.

663
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:09,920
Night-night.

664
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:13,280
Yeah, I'm sorry I couldn't
be there today,

665
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:15,960
but I'm coming up to visit you
this weekend.

666
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:18,880
And we can go to six flags,
okay?

667
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:21,340
I love you, cookie.

668
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:23,960
Have a great day.

669
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:25,520
Love you.

670
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:27,320
Bye.

671
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:33,440
Man, over record:
<i>Lord of our far-flung battle line.</i>

672
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:35,360
<i>Beneath whose awful hand</i>

673
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:39,520
<i>we hold dominion</i>
<i>over palm and pine.</i>

674
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:41,040
<i>Lord, God of hosts,</i>

675
00:58:41,240 --> 00:58:45,720
<i>be with us yet</i>
<i>lest we forget,</i>

676
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:47,760
<i>lest we forget.</i>

677
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:51,080
<i>The tumult</i>
<i>and the shouting dies.</i>

678
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:54,400
<i>The captains and the kings...</i>

679
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:10,080
Whew.

680
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:12,400
Is it cold enough
in here, sweetie,

681
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:15,600
or you want me to turn it down
some more?

682
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:18,800
Damn Santa Ana's
got so hot today, huh?

683
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,080
No, this is fine.

684
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:25,320
I guess we don't want it
too cool, do we?

685
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:27,840
No, we don't.

686
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:32,760
Why don't you
turn over for me, baby.

687
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:42,680
Back massage
on my clients' backs first.

688
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:44,320
Yeah.

689
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:47,160
You got a nice one.

690
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:49,160
You work out.

691
00:59:49,360 --> 00:59:51,160
Yeah, a little.

692
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:52,480
Yeah?

693
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:54,680
Yeah? Does that feel good?

694
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:56,240
Oh, yes.

695
00:59:56,440 --> 00:59:57,600
Yeah, relax.

696
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:05,520
That's really nice.

697
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:11,660
Oh, my God!

698
01:00:11,860 --> 01:00:13,280
Get out!

699
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:16,200
You're a fag! You're a fag!

700
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:17,120
You think I'm a fag?

701
01:00:17,160 --> 01:00:21,040
Huh? You think I fucking
like that shit?

702
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:24,800
You disgust me!

703
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:25,600
Oh!

704
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:27,400
Fucking whore!

705
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:31,440
Sick.

706
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:34,240
I fucking hate it!

707
01:00:48,780 --> 01:00:50,670
Fucking whore!

708
01:00:50,870 --> 01:00:52,760
Fucking bitch!

709
01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:56,120
Fuck you!

710
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:14,720
You think it was
an accident? Huh?

711
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:19,520
Me ending up
being roomed next door to you?

712
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:21,400
It's no accident.

713
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:22,240
That's him.

714
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:26,040
That's God
fucking with me again!

715
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:27,840
I didn't ask
for this shit!

716
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:31,040
You made those kids
do that to me.

717
01:01:31,720 --> 01:01:33,080
Fuck you!

718
01:02:26,120 --> 01:02:29,760
This is what it's like
to be a victim.

719
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:34,760
Well...

720
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:39,360
You preached the sermon.

721
01:04:03,320 --> 01:04:05,720
Jim:
<i>What'd it feel like?</i>

722
01:04:06,520 --> 01:04:10,160
Carl:
<i>You only got about 40 seconds</i>

723
01:04:10,360 --> 01:04:12,320
<i>once you cut it.</i>

724
01:04:13,160 --> 01:04:15,840
<i>I just close my eyes.</i>

725
01:04:15,880 --> 01:04:19,920
<i>Ain't got to do nothing</i>
<i>but be there.</i>

726
01:04:20,320 --> 01:04:24,640
Jim: <i>I felt like an engine
with a million Miles on it.</i>

727
01:04:24,840 --> 01:04:27,520
Carl:
<i>That's how it is, Jim.</i>

728
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:33,300
<i>That is the true telling</i>

729
01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:36,960
<i>of a thing like this.</i>

730
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:02,860
Female newscaster:
<i>We are getting breaking news</i>

731
01:05:03,060 --> 01:05:04,480
<i>from our affiliate</i>
<i>in California.</i>

732

<i>in Ventura county.</i>
<i>Rachel?</i>

734
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:09,480
Rachel:
<i>Law enforcement have worked</i>

735
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:11,320
<i>at bringing to justice</i>
<i>a killer</i>

736
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:14,320
<i>who has been preying on</i>
<i>and murdering</i>

737
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:16,080
<i>six transsexual</i>
<i>prostitutes.</i>

738
01:05:16,280 --> 01:05:21,080
<i>Police have begun a state-wide</i>
<i>manhunt for this man:</i>

739
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:23,200
<i>James Tahna.</i>

740
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:27,640
<i>Police have searched</i>
<i>the man's room,</i>

741
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:29,440
<i>and they think they have</i>
<i>the name of someone</i>

742
01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:32,160
<i>they are now calling</i>
<i>a person of interest.</i>

743
01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:34,080
Male newscaster:
<i>Police say they have witnesses</i>

744
01:05:34,120 --> 01:05:36,800
<i>who say they saw a man</i>
<i>badly beat a prostitute</i>

<i>at a nearby hotel and put her</i>
<i>in the trunk of his...</i>

746
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:41,400
Female newscaster:
<i>The grief tourist's moniker</i>

747
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:43,680
<i>comes from the fact that</i>
<i>the killer had left the bodies</i>

748
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:45,440
<i>at the murder sites</i>
<i>of other serial killers,</i>

749
01:05:45,640 --> 01:05:48,360
<i>even leaving behind a picture</i>
<i>of the other killers</i>

750
01:05:48,560 --> 01:05:49,160
<i>as sort of a signature.</i>

751
01:05:49,360 --> 01:05:53,320
<i>Well, the grief tourist</i>
<i>seems to have struck again.</i>

752
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:56,000
Male reporter: <i>This spot,</i>
<i>the church behind me,</i>

753
01:05:56,040 --> 01:05:58,440
<i>is significant because it was</i>
<i>the site of what locals call</i>

754
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:00,840
<i>the Seventh-Day Adventist</i>
<i>church massacre,</i>

755

<i>which was burnt down</i>

756
01:06:02,920 --> 01:06:07,720
<i>by infamous mass murderer</i>
<i>Carl Marznap in 1968.</i>

757
01:06:18,080 --> 01:06:22,520
Carl: <i>People,
they... they come here to see this.</i>

758
01:06:22,920 --> 01:06:27,360
<i>Now people's gonna</i>
<i>come here to see it,</i>

759
01:06:27,560 --> 01:06:28,480
<i>the spot where you...</i>

760
01:06:28,520 --> 01:06:29,600
<i>Jim:</i>
<i>Come here to see me.</i>

761
01:06:29,800 --> 01:06:32,720
Carl: <i>They going to come to the hotel room.</i>

762
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:35,160
Jim:
<i>My hotel room.</i>

763
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:37,040
Carl: <i>The spot where you killed her.</i>

764
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:38,920
Jim: <i>The spot where I killed the whore.</i>

765
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:43,840
<i>And then they'll go</i>
<i>to the spot where I worked.</i>

766
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:51,760
<i>And they're going to want</i>
<i>to know everything about me.</i>

767
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:17,960
All the bullshit's
almost over, Jimmy.

768
01:08:23,680 --> 01:08:27,520
You had no say about the way
you was born.

769
01:08:27,720 --> 01:08:33,120
But you got all the say
about the way it's going to end.

770
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:37,360
Yeah.

771
01:08:40,040 --> 01:08:43,240
And when they think
of Jim Tahna,

772
01:08:43,440 --> 01:08:45,040
they goin' to fear him.

773
01:08:45,240 --> 01:08:49,440
Hey? They're not gonna think
of the victim he was.

774
01:08:49,640 --> 01:08:53,560
They're gonna think
of the victims he made.

775
01:08:54,520 --> 01:08:56,240
Yeah.

776
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:01,920
That's it, Jim.

777
01:09:05,100 --> 01:09:07,040
That's it, Jim.

778
01:09:08,840 --> 01:09:11,840
It's all over now.

779
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:40,840
Announcer, over radio:
<i>Time, weather and...</i>

780
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:44,360
Talk show host: <i>We're talking
this morning about this Tahna guy</i>

781
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:45,840
<i>they found out there</i>
<i>in California.</i>

782
01:09:46,040 --> 01:09:48,160
Man 1: <i>I'm from Yonkers.</i>
<i>I got kids here.</i>

783
01:09:48,360 --> 01:09:49,040
<i>I got my family out here.</i>

784
01:09:49,240 --> 01:09:51,040
<i>And I just wish I could have</i>
<i>grabbed my...</i>

785
01:09:51,080 --> 01:09:52,620
Woman 1:
<i>He was abused as a child.</i>

786
01:09:52,820 --> 01:09:54,160
Man 2:
<i>I think it's very clear</i>

787
01:09:54,360 --> 01:09:57,640
<i>that Tahna and Marznap</i>
<i>were both victims of abuse.</i>

788
01:09:57,840 --> 01:10:00,200
<i>And this is what's possible</i>
<i>when victims of abuse</i>

789
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:01,240
<i>do not receive...</i>

790
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:03,320
Man 3: Some people are looking at this
<i>as a hate crime.</i>

791
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:04,640
Man 1:
<i>Obviously it's a hate crime.</i>

792
01:10:04,680 --> 01:10:06,640
You know, he's hating somebody.
<i>I mean, he's killing somebody.</i>

793
01:10:06,840 --> 01:10:09,600
<i>If it's a hate crime,</i>
<i>you know, whatever...</i>

794
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:19,280
It's very, very freaky
being here.

795
01:10:19,480 --> 01:10:21,880
It's like you can
feel him.

796
01:10:22,080 --> 01:10:23,760
