9
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,530
It's not like you.

10
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:16,910
Why?

11
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:18,710
You're running away!

12
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:38,780
Don't you want me?

13
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,020
Of course I do!

14
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:43,820
And I want you!

15
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,260
Yet we can't marry!

16
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:47,460
How many times do I have to tell you!

17
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:50,320
Because you may be called up
at any moment?

18
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:58,280
I don't care if you're called up
the day after we're married.

19
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,300
I'll cry no doubt.

20
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,250
But happiness comes
only through marriage.

21
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:15,540
Then will you come to my dormitory?

22
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:19,950
Will you spend the night with me?

23
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:22,210
You'll come?

24
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,250
I'll come.

25
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:27,140
I'll come.

26
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:38,090
As I thought...
Go back to your own dormitory.

27
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:43,350
I couldn't do that to you.

28
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:48,240
You... were just trying to test me!

29
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:54,150
Weakling... coward! I've had enough.

32
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:31,710
Hi! A rare meeting.

33
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,060
I just dropped by... to say "goodbye"

34
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:36,710
Your call... it came?

35
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:37,550
Yes.

36
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,660
And the date?

37
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:46,260
Tomorrow. My papers came 5 days ago
but I've been drinking ever since...

38
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:51,530
Oh yes... I met Michiko last night.

39
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,820
Aren't you marrying her?

40
00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:00,280
Tomorrow you then it'll be me!

41
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:02,190
But that needn't be the end.

42
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:09,730
I'm a born optimist and I've had
my share of earthly pleasures.

43
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,250
I only regret...

44
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:19,030
That I haven't left the germ of life
in the womb of some loving woman.

45
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:21,620
I may regret it, too.

46
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:25,890
But I can't be as optimistic as you.

47
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:31,000
The boss wants me... wait for me inside.

48
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,730
No... I'll see you tonight.

49
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,500
That's so.

50
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:36,770
See you.

51
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:14,590
Kaji seemed a bit upset.

52
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:17,460
Is something wrong?

53
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:22,370
Going to remain just friends forever?

54
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:26,990
You had the spunk to come
to work out here with him.

55
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,760
Throw yourself at him!

56
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,910
I did do.

57
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:37,120
He rejected you?

58
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,780
No. 12 and No. 13, stop that chatter!

59
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:42,260
I'll report you!

60
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:44,890
<i>Supervision of Colonial Labour</i>

61
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:47,980
I've read it twice.

62
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:49,750
Very interesting.

63
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:53,310
Smells of leftist tendencies, though.

64
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:56,810
What are you trying to say?

65
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:01,920
That men should be treated
as men, that is all.

66
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:03,410
In colonial territories it...

67
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:04,620
It's difficult?

68
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,700
That's right.

69
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:11,740
We profit by exploiting Chinese
labour... wasn't that the idea?

70
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:12,710
That's right.

71
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:15,930
Doesn't that conflict with your theory?

72
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:18,390
That's true.

73
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,970
Mind if I smoke?

74
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:23,520
No, I don't mind.

75
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:28,840
What do you think?

76
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:33,620
Without the contradiction my theory
isn't needed.

77
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:43,010
In other words, you feel it's possible
to improve work records... is that it?

78
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:53,850
A possibility. By the way, I want you
to take over at the Loh Hu Liong mines.

79
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:59,350
Any objections to being sent off
into the hinterlands?

80
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:03,960
I'm not forcing you.

81
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:09,120
You've analysed the situation
quite well... on paper.

82
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:12,390
Would you want it to end up only on paper?

83
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:14,000
Of course not.

84
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:22,140
Whenever you're ready to put
your theories into actual practice...

85
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:30,190
I'll do my bit to help...
by having you exempted from army duty.

86
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,810
Exemption? From military service?

87
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:39,270
You're not alone in the exemption.
There are dozens of others.

88
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:43,000
No. What I meant was...

89
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:45,470
It's just the idea...

90
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:50,670
Of accepting military exemption in exchange
for the Lo Hu Liong job that worries me.

91
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:55,520
A bad habit! Leave well enough alone.

92
00:09:57,110 --> 00:10:02,790
The savage fighting continues
with only one way of resisting.

93
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:06,230
By facing a life sentence in prison.

94
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:16,130
Neither of us had the courage
to face up to it.

95
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:19,660
Yes... you're right.

96
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:37,810
A gift from Heaven!

97
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:46,570
Not even the commander of the
Kwangtung Army ever dared slap me!

98
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:57,530
Go to Loh Hu Liong with Michiko.

99
00:10:57,730 --> 00:11:01,200
Michiko... his sweetheart? Is pretty?

100
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,720
The most beautiful girl in the world.

101
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:09,080
But to me you're much more beautiful.

102
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:17,730
Hey... You called yourself a
shepherd's dog didn't you?

103
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:25,390
Why not? A good dog can
lead sheep to greener pastures...

104
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:28,130
And can earn their eternal gratitude.

105
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:30,490
If such things exist.

106
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:34,870
Me? I'll take this one.

107
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:44,050
My little Mannon, your hair
has the aroma of dried grass.

108
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,040
Michiko...

109
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,480
My best wishes go with you!

110
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:28,780
Go with Kaji to Loh Hu Liong!

111
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,090
Let this war go to the dogs!

112
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:33,820
You mustn't let happiness...

113
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,250
He may never come back...

114
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,230
I won't be called up

115
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:08,920
Loh Hu Liong is a tiny
Manchurian village.

116
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:14,790
All we'll find there are iron ore
and labour camps.

117
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:19,130
Would you go with me to such a place?

118
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:27,260
I'd follow you... anywhere!

119
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:32,860
It may affect your whole life.
Think it over!

120
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:39,890
If the army ever called you
to active duty.

121
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:46,410
I... I'd even been planning to have
a child by you.

122
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:51,930
Is that too absurd?

123
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,750
What a honeymoon!

124
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:47,930
What did you say?

125
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:50,800
The wind... and this dust!

126
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,690
I don't care! It's wonderful!

127
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:56,800
Like gravel in my mouth!

128
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:08,680
<i>Loh Hu Liong</i>

129
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:39,140
You must think I'm blind!

130
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:39,670
What?

131
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:44,920
Trick me into giving
you special rations? Oh no!

132
00:15:58,310 --> 00:15:59,740
Kaji from Head Office?

133
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,010
That's right.

134
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:05,710
I'm Okishima. We're working partners.

135
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:07,790
We can dispense with the niceties.

136
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:13,910
What ever made you come to this hole?

137
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:15,070
Come.

138
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:15,890
Thank you.

139
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,540
Anything for love's sake, eh?

140
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,470
Yes, how do you do?

141
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:25,120
Please, this way.

142
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:30,340
Haul their bags to their new quarters.

143
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:44,230
I read your report...
the one about supervision of labour.

144
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:47,400
Filled with fancy words...

145
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,890
Oh, madam... please!

146
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:55,350
Men here don't go for fancy talk.
You'll have little in common.

147
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:58,320
Thanks for your advice.

148
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,460
What's so funny?

149
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:03,320
Sorry! Your own fancy talk sounds
so out of place.

150
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:09,370
Very well written! Reaching the pith
of the matter.

151
00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:12,720
Yes! Reaching but not quite grasping...

152
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,710
Why is that?

153
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:17,640
If I knew, I'd write a book!

154
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:22,620
I'll take your wife.
You go see the boss.

155
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:25,030
Say, Furuya... show him the way!

156
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:31,610
I know this is nothing new, sir.

157
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:35,230
But our first shift requires 2,500 men.

158
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:38,080
Only 1,500 turned up this morning.

159
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:43,110
How can we be expected
to make our production goal?

160
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:48,270
We're at war, Okazaki!
We must expect such shortages.

161
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:49,230
But...

162
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:54,770
You can't produce unless
all conditions are perfect, is that it?

163
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:58,670
I didn't mean that, but Labour
must help us.

164
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:08,760
Kaji... reporting for work, sir!

165
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:13,300
You're Kaji?

166
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:16,230
I'll introduce you.

167
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:20,020
2nd Pit Supervisor, Mr Higuchi.

168
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:23,330
His Foreman, Mr. Kawashima.

169
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:26,500
1st Pit supervisor, Mr Koiki.

170
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:29,210
And his Foreman, Mr. Okazaki.

171
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:35,990
This is Mr. Kaji... sent by
Head Office as Labour Supervisor.

172
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:37,010
Pleased to meet you.

173
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:42,310
You're just in time. Please, sit down.

174
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:48,120
We're discussing our labour shortage.
Any good ideas?

175
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:55,390
I’d like to talk to Okishima first...

176
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:59,190
And find how many men are available.

177
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:04,100
If their labour conditions are improved,

178
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:07,880
all the men will report for work.

179
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:12,580
Yes... and in more concrete form?

180
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:17,190
Our employment system
must be changed.

181
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:23,090
The labour boss must be replaced
by a direct employment system.

182
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:26,590
You'd be throttling the mines.
It's ridiculous.

183
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:28,450
You agree Kawashima?

184
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,540
And why so?

185
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:37,070
Because... your name was Kaji?
You should know better!

186
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:39,850
We have some 200 labour groups here.

187
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:48,310
How many have no rake-off system
or don't cheat on food rations?

188
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:49,430
I doubt if such a group exists.

189
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:56,300
But our problem is how to raise
our work attendance rate.

190
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:59,370
Labourers lose the desire to work...

191
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:03,600
If, basically, labour condition are evil.

192
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:06,280
Regardless of how things are basically,

193
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:12,110
labourers aren't what you make
them out to be in theory.

194
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:16,450
Once they earn more than they need,

195
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,060
they pour it into the crotch of women.

196
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:25,380
A difference in opinion.
Such methods never gain results.

197
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:33,040
But, Kaji, the theory may be correct
and yet not apply in reality.

198
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:36,780
Then... either the theory is wrong.

199
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:39,380
Or the application is incorrect.

200
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:42,640
Be that as it may. Try it your way.

201
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:46,520
I respect revolutionary ideas.

202
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:53,220
Moving on. Yours is not a desk job.
It covers all aspects of the men's lives.

203
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:59,780
Food rationing, the disposal of
the excrements of 10,000 men,

204
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:03,380
handling menstrual cases among women.

205
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:04,750
Of women?

206
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:08,650
We have comfort quarters for our men.

207
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:13,430
As Okishima will point out,
there are 60-odd Manchu women.

208
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:16,460
From today... you're their boss.

209
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:21,840
I'm glad to see you're not a bachelor.

210
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:28,790
Go home now and do your duty
by your wife... but don't overdo it!

211
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:40,510
But why must our group be disbanded?

212
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:45,260
Poor records... you've been
raking off too much.

213
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:48,490
Are you joking? What's it all about?

214
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:51,930
Shall I show you the evidence?

215
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:58,490
Why need the company make trouble
over our contracts with the men?

216
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:01,780
Our money is for the labourers.

217
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:06,530
But Foreman Okazaki says
our men work very hard.

218
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:09,820
Yes... but your rolls have been
over-padded.

219
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:11,370
But Mr. Okazaki...

220
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:13,810
I'm not Okazaki... I'm Kaji of Labour!

221
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:28,220
Mr. Okishima, put in a good word
for us. We're like old buddies!

222
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:31,590
That's probably why I'm mouldy.

223
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:37,460
And Kaji has been scrubbing me until
I'm practically raw!

224
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:41,600
Mr. Supervisor... poor living quarters,

225
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:45,720
and poor food make our men sickly.

226
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:52,740
I know! Inadequate quarters...
Poor food! Men can't work that way.

227
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:56,030
But there is still greater evil.

228
00:22:57,330 --> 00:22:58,420
Must I tell you?

229
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:02,570
You're that evil!

230
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:06,290
Now get this... I give the men my word!

231
00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:10,130
The food situation will improve.

232
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:13,100
Better quarters will be considered.

233
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,420
But it's no use as long as
you exploit them.

234
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:23,750
You make a practice of lending money,

235
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:28,790
to transient labourers and binding
them for life.

236
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:33,140
You squeeze as much profit out of them
as you can.

237
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:37,590
Your slave-drivers torture those
who try to escape.

238
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:40,340
I won't allow such methods!

239
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:46,440
You won't? And so what?
You're a mere employee of this company.

240
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:49,820
Won't allow it, eh? Try and stop us!

241
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:54,840
Hey! Any more threats and I'll kick
your nuts in!

242
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:06,560
The gentlemen are having a bad day.
We'll come back.

243
00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:07,740
Mr. Muta!

244
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:14,980
You can keep this!
And I've sent your packages back.

245
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:27,270
They left too peacefully!
They're up to something.

246
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:42,240
A tour of inspection?
I'm grateful to you gentlemen.

247
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:50,070
By the way... see to it that
we get the men we need.

248
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,510
The old man won't take excuses.

249
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:58,960
Sure, you'll get them.
But don't kill 'em off too fast.

250
00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:30,030
What happened?

251
00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:33,030
The lazy dogs refuse to move!

252
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,950
Beating them senseless won't help.

253
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:38,910
Cruelty makes them worse.

254
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:43,990
I take orders from Okazaki... not you!

255
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:46,770
What goes on here doesn't concern you.

256
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:48,470
Then you refuse to stop?

257
00:25:48,570 --> 00:25:49,360
Of course.

258
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:53,620
Good! From tomorrow you'll have
no men to beat.

259
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:58,320
What's that? You're in the pit now.

260
00:25:58,530 --> 00:26:01,020
You can't pull rank on us down here!

261
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:04,320
Lazy ones... You don't wish to work?

262
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:05,620
Then... don't!

263
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:08,970
From tomorrow you needn't come.

264
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:13,370
Remain by the cosy
fireplaces in your barracks.

265
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:20,690
But remember...
You will receive no food!

266
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:33,610
Just returning home?

267
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:38,480
Did you want something?

268
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:44,590
Just one question. Did you threaten
to shut off our supply of labour?

269
00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:48,600
Well... how about it?

270
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:52,330
We can discuss it in the morning.

271
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:58,880
Morning? I can understand why
you'd prefer it so.

272
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:01,760
Especially with one's wife watching...

273
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:03,470
Do you think so?

274
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:04,730
Answer my question!

275
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:05,870
What's with you?

276
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:16,930
Your brutality may cow your labourers,
but I'm not impressed.

277
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:19,790
I warned your man.

278
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:24,360
Mr. Kaji! You surely know how
important that ore is to us.

279
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:27,840
What's so wrong about beating the men?

280
00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:31,800
As long as the ore keeps coming out,
why the fuss?

281
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:37,650
Which is more important...
the ore... or the men?

282
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:39,670
I never think of things in that way.

283
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:44,980
One doesn't compare men with minerals.

284
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,340
Kindness will produce more ore.

285
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:58,500
Let me make it clear that Okazaki
of Loh Hu Liong can't be changed...

286
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:01,820
By any of your half-baked ideas.

287
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:06,220
I stick to my own way. Remember that!

288
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:09,450
I will! And I'll stick to my own ways.

289
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:28,540
These gentlemen from the KEMPEITAI

290
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:32,530
are offering us 600 special labourers.

291
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,360
Special labourers?

292
00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:40,680
Prisoners from North China.
All you need do is keep them fed.

293
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:44,630
A heaven-sent blessing!
We're short of men here.

294
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:46,530
Completely unexpected!

295
00:28:46,670 --> 00:28:50,320
Yes! Our Head Office will certainly
be pleased.

296
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,200
Kaji... talk it over with Okishima.

297
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:55,960
In what way?

298
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,500
I'll give the instructions.

299
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:02,200
I never repeat my instructions...

300
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,180
Is that Understand?

301
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:11,100
First: Special labourers must be
isolated from ordinary labourers.

302
00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:16,770
Second: Their quarters will be
enclosed with barbed wire.

303
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:21,980
This barbed wire must be electrified.
Is that understood?

304
00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:30,270
Food and labour are left in your hands
but they must not escape!

305
00:29:31,810 --> 00:29:35,150
How much electricity can you supply?

306
00:29:36,930 --> 00:29:38,990
About 3,000 volts.

307
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:40,220
Good enough!

308
00:29:41,390 --> 00:29:45,320
They will be delivered to you
a week from today.

309
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:48,490
Arrival time will be notified later.

310
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,200
You understand?

311
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:55,180
We won't be ready in a week!

312
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,260
What?

313
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,980
Not too anxious to get help?

314
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:04,260
Kaji!

315
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:08,980
Why should we take over
supervision of POWs?

316
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,820
Make all preparations.

317
00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:13,540
Wait!

318
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:17,490
I need your answer!

319
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:20,520
We understand! We'll be ready.

320
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:44,050
To be safe we need a whole
platoon of armed men.

321
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:50,370
I hate being either aggressive or
defensive. Go if you wish!

322
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:56,450
Why play the hero in front of me?
Some day you'll appreciate me.

323
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:04,470
Chen... how's your mother?

324
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:07,970
She's in and out of bed all day.

325
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:12,200
Ill? Take good care of her.

326
00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:12,980
Yes.

327
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,060
Mr. Kaji... I wish to ask a favour.

328
00:31:20,770 --> 00:31:24,610
May I have some white flour
from the storeroom.

329
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:27,660
For your mother?

330
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,670
Yes.

331
00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:36,190
I wish I could help but I can't
make any exceptions.

332
00:31:40,570 --> 00:31:41,960
Here she comes!

333
00:32:17,390 --> 00:32:20,410
Chen... how does all this strike you?

334
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:28,500
They are your fellow countrymen
who lived in anti-Japanese areas.

335
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:34,000
They may be friends of your
mother from Shantung.

336
00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:42,320
My mother raised me so as not to be
anti-Japanese.

337
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:48,190
In a battle area, you'd be murdered
as a sympathizer.

338
00:33:08,410 --> 00:33:09,180
The key!

339
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:12,890
We haven't received it yet.

340
00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:26,060
From Loh Hu Liong?

341
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:26,730
That's right.

342
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:27,790
Are you in charge?

343
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:28,340
That's right.

344
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:29,410
What's your name?

345
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:30,050
Kaji.

346
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:34,000
Yes... Kaji! I never forget a name.

347
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:38,070
Good! I transfer the labourers to you.

348
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:42,370
Never forget that these men
are prisoners of war.

349
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:47,680
To deal with them you must be
military men at heart.

350
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:50,850
Civilian negligence will not be tolerated!

351
00:33:51,050 --> 00:33:51,910
You understand?

352
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:53,190
We understand.

353
00:33:53,910 --> 00:33:55,770
You don't understand Kaji!

354
00:33:56,670 --> 00:33:59,220
You think your seven men can handle
600 prisoners?

355
00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:01,860
What if they escape?

356
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,380
We received no special instructions.

357
00:34:06,050 --> 00:34:08,520
I assumed this meant
no special danger.

358
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:11,690
You're quite a bold one!

359
00:34:12,930 --> 00:34:13,710
How old are you?

360
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,600
I am 28.

361
00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:17,880
You're married?

362
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:20,940
May I have the key?

363
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:42,520
You're a stubborn one!
l like 'em that way.

364
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:50,800
You'll witness the transfer?

365
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:55,950
Don't be ridiculous!
I'm on official leave.

366
00:34:57,420 --> 00:35:01,510
You seem to feel that the army
can make mistakes.

367
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,590
Don't worry!

368
00:35:03,130 --> 00:35:06,310
When the army says 604... it's 604!

369
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:09,270
Send in a receipt immediately.

370
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,960
I don't care if they all die
but they must not escape!

371
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:25,930
Dirty scum!

372
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:09,000
Get up! Get up!

373
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:13,210
They unload this mess on us?

374
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:15,130
Hey! Open the others.

375
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:15,910
Get up.

376
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:29,250
Hurry up! Get off!

377
00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:35,950
Get off! Get off!

378
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,610
Line up... double file!

379
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:46,350
Mr. Kaji... Mr. Kaji!

380
00:36:49,970 --> 00:36:50,950
This looks bad!

381
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:53,030
What is it?

382
00:36:53,650 --> 00:36:55,720
Hurry! Hurry!

383
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,700
They've steamed to death.

384
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:21,610
Help me! Help me!

385
00:37:34,650 --> 00:37:38,370
Don't let them eat! Stop them!

386
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:12,000
Mr. Kaji!

387
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,870
Get back! Get back!

388
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:20,160
Don't eat that!

389
00:38:21,330 --> 00:38:22,390
Don't eat that!

390
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:44,660
You'll all die!

391
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,910
Give me the whip!

392
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:02,430
Kaji! Here!

393
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:27,030
The special labourers
are unfit to work.

394
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:30,820
Let them have a month's rest
They're half dead!

395
00:39:33,290 --> 00:39:38,600
Meaning these anti-Japanese elements
will be fed without working?

396
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:43,910
If you had witnessed the scene
I'm sure you'd agree with me, sir.

397
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:48,760
They are POWs. Is that why
12 were allowed to die?

398
00:39:49,310 --> 00:39:54,460
If you want 'em dead, stuff them
with raw beans... they'll die!

399
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:58,530
Say... watch that tongue of yours!

400
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:04,070
What you're saying amounts to
a denouncement of the military.

401
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:11,470
I'll adopt your opinion just once more.

402
00:40:11,570 --> 00:40:12,780
Just once more?

403
00:40:12,890 --> 00:40:15,310
Yes... just once more!

404
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:17,470
And why so?

405
00:40:17,870 --> 00:40:18,900
You'd like to know?

406
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:25,540
Despite all your convictions,
l just got a report from Furuya.

407
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:31,590
150 men under your supervision
have just walked out on us.

408
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:38,780
I shall overlook the matter this time.

409
00:40:54,850 --> 00:40:56,790
I give you all warning.

410
00:40:59,010 --> 00:41:02,460
I know you all want to escape.

411
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:06,800
However... you cannot escape from here.

412
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:09,640
If you even try...

413
00:41:11,370 --> 00:41:14,410
This mongrel's fate will be yours.

414
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:17,060
Chen... release the dog!

415
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:51,460
Tomorrow means a new month
of still higher production goals.

416
00:41:53,190 --> 00:41:58,330
The Directors have even discussed
replacement of all top men here.

417
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:05,050
I will accept this disgrace if
production increase is impossible.

418
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:09,010
However, we have not yet
done our utmost.

419
00:42:10,770 --> 00:42:15,420
Until we attain the 20% production
increase demanded of us...

420
00:42:15,430 --> 00:42:19,090
We must continue this crash program.

421
00:42:20,290 --> 00:42:22,780
Are there any dissenting opinions?

422
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:30,180
In the name of final victory, I refuse.

423
00:42:30,190 --> 00:42:33,270
to listen to any of your excuses!

424
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:38,970
Mr. Koike... tell him he has my word.

425
00:42:40,170 --> 00:42:44,690
I, Okazaki, vow that Pit No. 1
will top the new goal.

426
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:53,390
And I'm sure you've no objections
regarding my methods.

427
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:57,850
Do as you think best!
The goal must be achieved.

428
00:42:58,580 --> 00:43:02,610
Understand? Lash them on
with still greater fury.

429
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:06,040
Any Chinaman who shirks may be killed.

430
00:43:08,010 --> 00:43:11,060
Push them! Whip them!
We need that extra 20%!

431
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:17,510
Men who top their quota
will be amply rewarded.

432
00:43:18,110 --> 00:43:21,240
Remember! We're at war here... at war!

433
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:26,270
Anyone here feel he can't do this?

434
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:38,420
Good! Give 'em everything you have.

435
00:43:39,270 --> 00:43:40,380
I'll assume all responsibility.

436
00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:46,070
Starting tomorrow, you will go to work.

437
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:49,320
Rations will be kaoliang and bean-lees.

438
00:43:50,130 --> 00:43:52,430
The same as ordinary labourers.

439
00:43:55,330 --> 00:43:56,750
You don't smoke?

440
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:58,490
I did formerly.

441
00:43:58,840 --> 00:43:59,970
You stopped?

442
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:05,530
When we run out of tobacco, we suffer.

443
00:44:05,630 --> 00:44:10,010
I can't believe Japanese will
keep us supplied.

444
00:44:10,550 --> 00:44:15,510
Now that we've revived you,
you would bear a grudge?

445
00:44:16,490 --> 00:44:19,300
We were not fighting men.

446
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:22,560
We have the right to demand release.

447
00:44:22,850 --> 00:44:28,040
I haven't the authority to free you.

448
00:44:28,050 --> 00:44:29,800
I am only authorized to detain you.

449
00:44:30,450 --> 00:44:34,580
Master... when we be free?

450
00:44:35,050 --> 00:44:40,030
We all not soldier. We no fight!

451
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:46,030
Japan soldier come...
Make bad all Chinese woman...

452
00:44:46,630 --> 00:44:49,370
Take away all man... Bring here.

453
00:44:50,110 --> 00:44:53,870
No give us food... Many die!

454
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:57,130
Not die... They killed!

455
00:44:58,950 --> 00:45:03,550
I cannot set you free but I can

456
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:06,030
promise that you will not be killed.

457
00:45:07,930 --> 00:45:10,810
Japanese speak clever words.

458
00:45:11,620 --> 00:45:13,810
Also write clever words.

459
00:45:14,470 --> 00:45:17,940
But never they keep promise.

460
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:23,550
I believe your name was Kao?

461
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:25,900
Now remember this...

462
00:45:26,370 --> 00:45:30,450
You have been
placed under our supervision.

463
00:45:33,750 --> 00:45:39,260
Whether that barbed wire remains
or is removed, depends on you!

464
00:45:46,330 --> 00:45:46,990
Walk faster!

465
00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:48,430
Walk faster!

466
00:45:51,100 --> 00:45:51,860
Come on!

467
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:06,980
Step along there!

468
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:33,210
Mr. Kaji, if men escape,
it mean trouble?

469
00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:36,890
Why need they escape?

470
00:46:39,070 --> 00:46:42,170
Those men work before in own village.

471
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:45,470
Do they wish to work here?

472
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:51,780
Here they have no mother...
no wife... and no children.

473
00:46:59,870 --> 00:47:05,040
Kaji... how about those special
labourers? Why so many left?

474
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:06,790
They're the sick ones.

475
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:12,150
Make sure they're not feigning illness.

476
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:19,790
I didn't come to find fault,
but I'd like to see their quarters.

477
00:47:19,790 --> 00:47:20,510
This way...

478
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:33,380
No signs of any breaks?

479
00:47:33,980 --> 00:47:35,460
No, I don't think so.

480
00:47:35,950 --> 00:47:38,280
They must be given some incentive.

481
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:39,930
I think so too.

482
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:44,440
What do prisoners dream of the most?

483
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:47,440
Freedom, I suppose!

484
00:47:48,110 --> 00:47:51,130
Freedom? You must be a poet.

485
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:56,040
It's women! If they're men
they dream of women.

486
00:47:56,830 --> 00:48:00,230
What did you dream of as a bachelor?

487
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:02,690
Of the ways of the Empire? I doubt it!

488
00:48:04,050 --> 00:48:07,440
The way to make prisoners work...

489
00:48:07,450 --> 00:48:10,120
is to satisfy 70% of their bodily lust.

490
00:48:10,550 --> 00:48:12,210
But... women...

491
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:17,930
Very simple! You supervise the
comfort girls... send them inside.

492
00:48:18,860 --> 00:48:20,460
Is it really necessary?

493
00:48:25,830 --> 00:48:28,810
You... do you want a woman?

494
00:48:34,490 --> 00:48:38,660
See? The word "woman" alone
brings joy to their hearts.

495
00:48:39,950 --> 00:48:45,100
What is man? He's not a poem!
Nor is he mortality!

496
00:48:45,110 --> 00:48:48,490
A mere mass of matter
formed of lust and greed!

497
00:48:50,250 --> 00:48:52,540
I shall ask their leaders.

498
00:48:52,810 --> 00:48:56,130
Who gives your orders? Prisoners or I?

499
00:48:56,750 --> 00:49:01,820
I'm concerned over their welfare.
See that it's carried out!

500
00:49:05,260 --> 00:49:06,250
Stop loafing!

501
00:49:07,370 --> 00:49:08,360
Hurry up!

502
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:18,130
Stop loafing!

503
00:49:24,830 --> 00:49:26,270
You dog!

504
00:49:43,970 --> 00:49:47,960
Master... this man sick!
He maybe die.

505
00:49:47,970 --> 00:49:48,780
What did you say?

506
00:49:48,820 --> 00:49:50,780
Have mercy... he sick man!

507
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:58,830
Save your whining for Kaji!
l don't care if you all die! Dogs!

508
00:50:19,550 --> 00:50:24,010
Kaji! Mr. Kaji! No want to see?

509
00:50:33,710 --> 00:50:34,760
Sister Jin!

510
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:41,550
Mr. Kaji... welcome!

511
00:50:42,070 --> 00:50:45,970
Mr. Kaji, you sleep with me?
l no want money.

512
00:50:49,910 --> 00:50:56,160
I'm sorry but I need 30 girls
for the special labourers.

513
00:50:56,570 --> 00:50:58,300
The Labour Office will pay for them.

514
00:50:58,400 --> 00:50:59,930
They go inside barb wire?

515
00:51:00,740 --> 00:51:03,850
Like all dogs... all sleep together?

516
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:08,290
If you don't like it,
you may refuse.

517
00:51:09,550 --> 00:51:12,520
It can't be helped...
we work girls.

518
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:16,520
I send 30 girls... tomorrow.

519
00:51:16,550 --> 00:51:18,280
Jin. Don't be crazy!

520
00:51:19,140 --> 00:51:22,440
We can't work with people watching!

521
00:51:23,070 --> 00:51:29,350
Do you realize how many men
there are in that compound?

522
00:51:30,230 --> 00:51:33,740
Don't come if you'd rather not.

523
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:36,480
I refuse... even if the others go.

524
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:41,090
You want to be a shirker?

525
00:51:41,550 --> 00:51:45,900
What do you mean?
I said it for all of us.

526
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:49,080
Talking big aren't you?

527
00:51:49,570 --> 00:51:51,940
Go... if you wish!

528
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:54,790
Be quiet! You don't make the decisions.

529
00:51:54,790 --> 00:51:55,790
So what?

530
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:57,290
Enough.

531
00:51:57,740 --> 00:52:00,850
Stop your bickering.

532
00:52:01,050 --> 00:52:05,160
I'll decide what to do.

533
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:13,740
Night time... 30 girls go... all right?

534
00:52:14,410 --> 00:52:16,620
Yes... send them.

535
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:35,170
What's wrong?

536
00:52:35,180 --> 00:52:36,470
The foreman did him in.

537
00:52:39,190 --> 00:52:39,810
Where?

538
00:52:39,910 --> 00:52:41,000
Pit No. 3.

539
00:52:41,170 --> 00:52:44,720
Okazaki, eh? Rush him to
the First Aid Station.

540
00:52:55,470 --> 00:52:58,870
He can't be allowed to
get away with this!

541
00:52:59,710 --> 00:53:01,590
I'll charge him with manslaughter.

542
00:53:01,730 --> 00:53:04,290
Come, now... relax!

543
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:09,260
It was unwise of Okazaki to use force.

544
00:53:09,270 --> 00:53:13,750
But he only did it in his eagerness
to increase production.

545
00:53:14,550 --> 00:53:17,170
After all, his motives were patriotic.

546
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:27,630
Okazaki may be a brute.
But only with this brutality.

547
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:29,440
can one operate that large pit.

548
00:53:29,950 --> 00:53:35,740
We need him just as we need you
to keep our 10,000 men in line.

549
00:53:37,570 --> 00:53:43,990
After all we're at war!
To achieve the ultimate victory,

550
00:53:43,990 --> 00:53:46,720
one must overlook the minor errors.

551
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:51,460
An error? A human being was murdered!

552
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:55,950
Kaji... I warn you again... relax!

553
00:53:57,680 --> 00:53:59,980
Think it over... you'll see!

554
00:54:00,220 --> 00:54:04,820
Can we exchange a good,
hard-working Japanese.

555
00:54:04,830 --> 00:54:07,580
for the life of one mere labourer?

556
00:54:08,810 --> 00:54:09,940
That's not the point!

557
00:54:13,340 --> 00:54:18,780
If you insist on pressing charges
include me as an accomplice.

558
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:23,100
I'll see that the suit goes
unfavourably for you.

559
00:54:24,550 --> 00:54:26,990
I can do it, you know.

560
00:54:27,530 --> 00:54:29,410
You'd dare distort the truth?

561
00:54:30,350 --> 00:54:34,110
Sir... will you see that it
never happens again?

562
00:54:35,030 --> 00:54:36,200
How shall we report it?

563
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:40,540
Well now...
Report it as an accidental death.

564
00:54:40,550 --> 00:54:44,270
Say he fell off a ledge...
It does happen you know.

565
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:53,090
You think I'll write that fake report?

566
00:54:53,090 --> 00:54:54,680
What else can we do!

567
00:54:55,350 --> 00:54:56,440
No. I refuse to write it!

568
00:54:56,450 --> 00:54:57,680
Yes, you will!

569
00:54:57,880 --> 00:55:01,420
If I fake that report
I'd become an accomplice.

570
00:55:01,530 --> 00:55:02,510
What are you going to do?

571
00:55:02,930 --> 00:55:04,290
I'll get Okazaki!

572
00:55:04,510 --> 00:55:11,470
You fool! Why try to be a hero?
You'll just run out of wind!

573
00:55:11,860 --> 00:55:15,070
Why ruin your own future with his?

574
00:55:22,780 --> 00:55:23,660
Mr. Kaji.

575
00:55:30,180 --> 00:55:34,190
One of our men was persecuted.
What became of him?

576
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:37,000
He died.

577
00:55:37,290 --> 00:55:39,620
And the culprit...
was he arrested?

578
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:43,770
He's still working.

579
00:55:43,780 --> 00:55:45,330
Will there be no trial?

580
00:55:46,650 --> 00:55:47,280
I suppose not.

581
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:52,730
If you wish to make excuses
make them before my men.

582
00:55:52,740 --> 00:55:55,540
No... I'm waiting for some girls.

583
00:55:55,550 --> 00:56:00,280
You promised not to kill!
You're no better than other Japanese!

584
00:56:02,830 --> 00:56:10,190
If you treat me like a murderer
just because I'm a Japanese...

585
00:56:10,190 --> 00:56:14,750
You'll be losing the only friend you have.

586
00:56:15,010 --> 00:56:16,330
Friend?

587
00:56:16,370 --> 00:56:17,960
You needn't believe me.

588
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:20,700
That's enough, Kao.

589
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:25,870
Does this man's death mean
that we may also die?

590
00:56:27,530 --> 00:56:28,820
I won't let them do it!

591
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:33,810
Women... women!

592
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:56,600
Open the gate!
Let the girls in.

593
00:56:57,250 --> 00:57:00,360
10 girls to a barrack...
Time limit: 10 p.m.

594
00:57:00,460 --> 00:57:01,050
Yes!

595
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:36,450
We're here... as I promised.

596
00:57:52,080 --> 00:57:54,220
Why do you send us women?

597
00:57:55,100 --> 00:58:00,320
Think as you please!
I'm just obeying orders.

598
00:58:00,460 --> 00:58:04,210
You send us harlots.

599
00:58:04,220 --> 00:58:12,810
And let us sleep with them like dogs
so that we will work harder?

600
00:58:12,850 --> 00:58:16,600
What's that about harlots?

601
00:58:17,470 --> 00:58:20,600
I wouldn't talk so big if I were you!

602
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:22,600
You wouldn't understand at all.

603
00:58:22,700 --> 00:58:29,200
Why make such a fuss?
You're no better off than we are.

604
00:58:30,910 --> 00:58:34,320
Do you feel no shame?

605
00:58:34,940 --> 00:58:38,560
I didn't come of my own free will!

606
00:58:38,660 --> 00:58:40,540
I refused to come!

607
00:58:44,710 --> 00:58:48,360
Isn't it just the same with you?

608
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:52,820
Do you enjoy digging for ore here?

609
00:58:54,050 --> 00:58:55,450
I'm sorry.

610
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:02,040
I didn't realise.

611
00:59:16,660 --> 00:59:17,980
Welcome home!

612
00:59:30,370 --> 00:59:31,840
You must be tired.

613
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:37,380
Look... isn't it wonderful?

614
00:59:37,410 --> 00:59:41,580
Her first egg! She cackled so loud...

615
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:47,640
That I went out to see
that was going on...and there it was!

616
00:59:49,270 --> 00:59:53,290
What is it? Is anything wrong?

617
00:59:53,390 --> 00:59:55,920
Not necessarily...

618
00:59:56,900 --> 00:59:59,390
Don't you want to come home?

619
00:59:59,970 --> 01:00:01,180
What happened?

620
01:00:03,980 --> 01:00:05,910
Tell me about it.

621
01:00:06,670 --> 01:00:10,480
Would you want a husband
who runs a whorehouse?

622
01:00:11,330 --> 01:00:13,030
What do you mean?

623
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:16,110
You'd vomit if I told you.

624
01:00:18,100 --> 01:00:22,060
What happens... with 600 men
and only 30 women?

625
01:00:23,950 --> 01:00:27,450
And now I'm an accomplice of murderers!

626
01:00:29,570 --> 01:00:30,890
That's not true!

627
01:00:31,890 --> 01:00:35,520
Even the prisoners won't
trust me any more.

628
01:00:38,580 --> 01:00:42,330
Given time... you'll gain their trust.

629
01:00:42,340 --> 01:00:44,080
Leave me alone for awhile.

630
01:00:49,630 --> 01:00:51,070
I'm sorry.

631
01:00:52,660 --> 01:00:53,540
What for?

632
01:00:54,650 --> 01:00:57,980
Since those men came
you've changed completely.

633
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:01,610
You think so?

634
01:01:03,340 --> 01:01:06,420
I feel that I'm fighting
a lone battle.

635
01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:12,920
You leave early every morning...

636
01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:15,710
And you always return late.

637
01:01:16,420 --> 01:01:18,990
During that time... you work.

638
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:27,920
Meanwhile, I putter around the house
and go out to do my shopping.

639
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:32,050
It's like doing nothing.

640
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:38,260
Yet... I try to convince myself.

641
01:01:38,270 --> 01:01:42,700
that what little I do
will help to keep you going.

642
01:01:44,410 --> 01:01:48,140
Otherwise, I'm nothing but
an ordinary housekeeper!

643
01:01:51,850 --> 01:01:53,820
I'm sorry... forgive me!

644
01:01:55,140 --> 01:01:57,400
It's now become an obsession.

645
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:00,990
Stop worrying about it...

646
01:02:03,230 --> 01:02:04,320
Just for now...

647
01:02:11,150 --> 01:02:14,400
It was nice talking to you.

648
01:02:14,410 --> 01:02:17,220
When one is confined here...

649
01:02:17,230 --> 01:02:20,760
One loses contact with the outside.

650
01:02:20,790 --> 01:02:22,230
Thank you!

651
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:26,770
What's the matter?
I'm a professional woman!

652
01:02:27,580 --> 01:02:34,500
I'm sorry to have taken your time.
I just wanted to talk.

653
01:02:34,900 --> 01:02:37,540
You plan to escape, don't you?

654
01:02:39,990 --> 01:02:43,850
It's impossible...
with all that barbed wire.

655
01:02:44,790 --> 01:02:49,170
And it's charged with electricity.

656
01:02:49,180 --> 01:02:51,970
Man put electricity through it.

657
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:53,810
You mustn't do anything rash!

658
01:02:53,820 --> 01:02:55,960
Man is such a weak creature.

659
01:02:56,350 --> 01:03:05,120
No amount of squirming
ever changes the course of events.

660
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:06,930
You're wrong!

661
01:03:07,120 --> 01:03:11,160
Man can become as strong as he wishes.

662
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:14,670
He need only find
the cause of his unhappiness.

663
01:03:40,260 --> 01:03:42,100
Want to make some money?

664
01:03:43,530 --> 01:03:48,080
By selling my girls elsewhere?
I don't go in for such deals.

665
01:03:48,520 --> 01:03:50,010
It's not women!

666
01:03:50,770 --> 01:03:51,770
More labourers?

667
01:03:52,580 --> 01:03:54,740
That's not quite what I meant.

668
01:03:56,350 --> 01:03:58,390
Those prisoners?

669
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:06,400
Too dangerous! A single mistake
and it could mean this.

670
01:04:08,420 --> 01:04:11,870
It's easy! Escaped prisoners
bring big profit.

671
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:16,210
If you help me
I'll split the profit with you.

672
01:04:17,170 --> 01:04:18,650
It's easy money!

673
01:04:21,110 --> 01:04:22,740
What do I do?

674
01:04:24,750 --> 01:04:27,920
The best way... is to do it like this!

675
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:33,360
The electricity... just flick it off!

676
01:04:35,620 --> 01:04:37,790
Someone asked you to do it?

677
01:04:38,950 --> 01:04:43,550
My buddy... the Japanese assistant,
Muta, who was just fired.

678
01:04:45,010 --> 01:04:48,540
It's too pitiful... to sell those men!

679
01:04:50,390 --> 01:04:53,640
You can't expect any sympathy from me!

680
01:04:55,360 --> 01:04:59,740
I'm a Korean... looked down upon
by both Japanese and Chinese!

681
01:05:25,690 --> 01:05:26,410
Keep moving!

682
01:05:34,630 --> 01:05:35,450
Learned One.

683
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:41,880
The Italians seem to have surrendered

684
01:05:41,890 --> 01:05:49,060
Oh? The downfall of Germany cannot
be far off. Our time nears...

685
01:05:49,070 --> 01:05:50,080
When will it be?

686
01:05:51,050 --> 01:05:56,670
Six months... perhaps a year!
We must be patient.

687
01:05:56,770 --> 01:05:58,370
What's going on here?

688
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:03,540
You scums!

689
01:06:13,040 --> 01:06:19,130
Thanks! This'll help revitalize
my man and our young assistants.

690
01:06:19,870 --> 01:06:25,090
If Okazaki picks up any more vitality,
it'll mean trouble for you.

691
01:06:25,810 --> 01:06:29,970
Didn't you know? Women prefer it
that way.

692
01:06:36,420 --> 01:06:43,630
Ma'am... it might be wiser to send
some of that flour to Kaji's wife.

693
01:06:43,640 --> 01:06:47,830
Why, yes, a good idea! I'll do that.

694
01:06:51,780 --> 01:06:54,220
Good day, sir!

695
01:07:01,340 --> 01:07:03,310
Welcome!

696
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:07,580
You want dumplings?

697
01:07:08,950 --> 01:07:12,660
Can you loan me a bag of white flour?

698
01:07:13,380 --> 01:07:18,240
My mother wishes some before she dies.

699
01:07:18,250 --> 01:07:19,340
One bag?

700
01:07:19,980 --> 01:07:23,470
Why don't you go get some?

701
01:07:24,900 --> 01:07:28,510
The Japanese sneak out
our rationed flour...

702
01:07:29,730 --> 01:07:32,690
And they're eating their fill.

703
01:07:32,690 --> 01:07:34,530
I can't do that.

704
01:07:34,560 --> 01:07:37,240
After all... Mr. Kaji trusts you.

705
01:07:38,290 --> 01:07:43,600
My flour was sneaked out by
the keeper with the big mole.

706
01:07:44,270 --> 01:07:46,260
It's stolen property!

707
01:07:46,460 --> 01:07:50,900
You still wish to buy some of it?

708
01:07:55,380 --> 01:07:59,850
Let him have half a bag!

709
01:07:59,950 --> 01:08:01,170
OK. OK.

710
01:08:02,040 --> 01:08:07,050
Young one... don't forget that
you are Chinese...

711
01:08:07,060 --> 01:08:09,920
And born of a Chinese mother.

712
01:08:12,610 --> 01:08:16,380
Go ask the one with the big mole.

713
01:08:51,250 --> 01:08:53,220
Don't do things so openly.

714
01:08:53,320 --> 01:08:54,560
What are you saying?

715
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:57,700
I saw Okazaki's wife leaving here.

716
01:08:59,660 --> 01:09:03,610
I hate to butt in,
but you're making a mistake.

717
01:09:04,790 --> 01:09:10,930
People appreciate the mistakes I make.
It's an old custom here.

718
01:09:11,030 --> 01:09:13,620
It's one that should be broken!

719
01:09:13,820 --> 01:09:17,030
Unpleasant as it might be,
that's my job.

720
01:09:18,010 --> 01:09:23,480
If it ever happens again,
I'll have to order an inventory.

721
01:09:25,820 --> 01:09:26,720
Mr. Kaji.

722
01:09:28,630 --> 01:09:35,630
We often wonder if you're one of us
or just a puppet of the Chinese.

723
01:09:37,340 --> 01:09:37,790
So what?

724
01:09:39,380 --> 01:09:40,980
Oh... that's all!

725
01:09:41,650 --> 01:09:46,820
But your sense of justice is tempered...

726
01:09:47,620 --> 01:09:52,060
By the fact that you can't take home
some flour to your own wife.

727
01:09:53,590 --> 01:09:57,620
Remove your dirty feet
when speaking to me!

728
01:09:59,020 --> 01:10:00,780
Do you need my help?

729
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:23,910
You fool! They'll see your light!

730
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:42,840
Go easy tonight.

731
01:10:48,860 --> 01:10:50,750
Hurry! It's the watchman.

732
01:11:06,300 --> 01:11:09,040
What's taking you so long?

733
01:11:14,330 --> 01:11:15,380
Get going!

734
01:11:56,650 --> 01:11:58,660
I'm so happy!

735
01:11:59,730 --> 01:12:04,870
You've never slept with a woman
before, have you?

736
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:14,030
You'll do it for me, won't you?

737
01:12:15,340 --> 01:12:18,790
Talk to Sai at the power station...

738
01:12:19,090 --> 01:12:24,630
and have him shut off the current
for just three minutes.

739
01:12:25,770 --> 01:12:28,960
I'll see that you're well rewarded.

740
01:12:30,050 --> 01:12:34,850
Then you can buy all the flour
you want...

741
01:12:34,860 --> 01:12:39,520
Without pretending to be a thief.

742
01:12:46,460 --> 01:12:49,340
Can't you make up your mind?

743
01:13:04,850 --> 01:13:06,490
Hey... Big Mole!

744
01:13:14,370 --> 01:13:17,010
Well, Chen... how'd it go?

745
01:13:18,010 --> 01:13:19,690
Did you get a good price?

746
01:13:22,280 --> 01:13:23,500
Or... did you eat it?

747
01:13:25,490 --> 01:13:27,630
Free white flour must taste good!

748
01:13:28,890 --> 01:13:30,080
What's up, Matsuda?

749
01:13:31,480 --> 01:13:34,490
Well, now... I wonder...

750
01:13:36,240 --> 01:13:42,680
It seems that even saints have
thieves as underlings...

751
01:13:55,300 --> 01:13:56,120
Mr. Kaji.

752
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:01,970
I'm willing to overlook it this time.

753
01:14:03,660 --> 01:14:09,540
However... for my reference, I'd like
to see how you handle this.

754
01:14:15,170 --> 01:14:17,390
Chen... stand up!

755
01:14:28,420 --> 01:14:29,580
Look at me!

756
01:14:38,070 --> 01:14:41,320
You didn't do it?

757
01:14:47,730 --> 01:14:48,810
I did...

758
01:14:50,970 --> 01:14:52,480
You did it alone?

759
01:14:52,490 --> 01:14:53,210
Yes.

760
01:14:59,090 --> 01:15:02,100
Matsuda, I hope you're satisfied.

761
01:15:02,300 --> 01:15:06,110
Before I expose all your
dirty doings... get out!

762
01:15:28,970 --> 01:15:31,020
Chen... what's the matter?

763
01:15:33,070 --> 01:15:38,110
I was a thief... and Mr. Kaji
struck me.

764
01:15:39,170 --> 01:15:41,410
Kaji? He struck you?

765
01:15:42,840 --> 01:15:48,480
It's nothing! Mr Kaji is Japanese...
I am Chinese

766
01:15:49,960 --> 01:15:51,300
It's all that simple!

767
01:16:07,180 --> 01:16:09,670
Sister Jin is occupied now.

768
01:16:12,770 --> 01:16:15,940
I think the man is a Korean.

769
01:16:16,760 --> 01:16:18,100
A Korean?

770
01:16:24,890 --> 01:16:27,800
Cute one...

771
01:16:29,220 --> 01:16:30,830
Have you been fighting?

772
01:16:39,290 --> 01:16:42,620
Let me use your room a while.

773
01:16:44,120 --> 01:16:45,220
What's ailing you?

774
01:16:46,630 --> 01:16:51,480
I can't understand it myself!

775
01:16:51,780 --> 01:16:57,170
Foolish one! You act like one
having her first love affair.

776
01:16:58,820 --> 01:17:01,130
I can't seem to forget Kao.

777
01:17:08,640 --> 01:17:14,080
Love at first sight... with a man
inside that barbed wire.

778
01:17:19,610 --> 01:17:20,940
Why not use your room?

779
01:17:23,260 --> 01:17:24,620
It's in disorder.

780
01:17:26,970 --> 01:17:29,330
Why do you ask?

781
01:17:47,900 --> 01:17:53,530
All Japanese are the same!
They don't consider us human beings.

782
01:17:54,430 --> 01:17:55,550
Please...

783
01:17:56,240 --> 01:18:01,420
Go to the power station
and do as I ask you.

784
01:18:01,620 --> 01:18:06,080
I can't! I couldn't commit treachery
for money.

785
01:18:06,180 --> 01:18:10,300
I realize that! You're a good man.

786
01:18:11,160 --> 01:18:13,690
But those men in there are prisoners.

787
01:18:13,690 --> 01:18:17,940
They'll be exploited and later killed.

788
01:18:17,950 --> 01:18:20,710
Can they really be saved?

789
01:18:21,300 --> 01:18:22,760
Of course!

790
01:18:25,250 --> 01:18:29,260
But the only one who can do it...

791
01:18:30,020 --> 01:18:32,370
is you!

792
01:18:45,780 --> 01:18:48,060
Later... please!

793
01:18:49,200 --> 01:18:51,790
Go do as I ask.

794
01:19:26,130 --> 01:19:26,950
I understand.

795
01:19:28,680 --> 01:19:30,070
I'm Chinese, too!

796
01:19:31,780 --> 01:19:34,650
I'm ready to do my bit.

797
01:19:37,640 --> 01:19:39,990
At exactly 1 a.m.

798
01:19:40,740 --> 01:19:43,770
When the siren sounds,
I'll cut the current.

799
01:19:46,140 --> 01:19:50,830
But only for 2 minutes! That's
the best I can do.

800
01:19:51,570 --> 01:19:52,730
Two minutes?

801
01:19:57,140 --> 01:19:57,890
Watch out!

802
01:19:59,280 --> 01:20:03,450
That packs 3,300 volts!

803
01:20:06,190 --> 01:20:09,960
Be careful! Don't let them see you.

804
01:20:09,970 --> 01:20:10,540
Sai!

805
01:20:10,640 --> 01:20:14,610
Yes! They mustn't see you leaving.

806
01:20:16,140 --> 01:20:19,890
My regards to our brothers inside
the barbed wire.

807
01:20:43,290 --> 01:20:47,110
They're in love!
It's not business.

808
01:20:47,310 --> 01:20:50,140
If it's love we won't pay.

809
01:20:50,360 --> 01:20:51,470
You're joking!

810
01:21:15,720 --> 01:21:19,500
A prisoner and a harlot in love!
It's so romantic!

811
01:21:21,860 --> 01:21:24,460
But... what will come of it?

812
01:21:26,930 --> 01:21:30,150
Nothing can come of it as long as
there is a war going on.

813
01:21:31,960 --> 01:21:36,280
All they can hope for is their love.

814
01:21:36,840 --> 01:21:38,580
Can't you let them marry?

815
01:21:39,130 --> 01:21:43,020
Yes... I'd like to if it's possible.

816
01:21:45,200 --> 01:21:47,430
I'm sure you'd want to help them.

817
01:21:48,460 --> 01:21:51,330
I'd like to... but it ends right there!

818
01:21:53,170 --> 01:21:55,040
Have some... they're delicious!

819
01:21:56,600 --> 01:21:57,410
What’s that?

820
01:21:58,440 --> 01:22:00,450
Rare, isn't it? It was given to us.

821
01:22:01,910 --> 01:22:02,550
By whom?

822
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:08,500
Try to guess! - It was Okazaki's wife!

823
01:22:09,820 --> 01:22:10,570
Send them all back!

824
01:22:12,070 --> 01:22:13,160
We can't... now!

825
01:22:15,460 --> 01:22:17,690
I can't send them back now!

826
01:22:18,010 --> 01:22:21,410
Return them! Tell her that I was furious.

827
01:22:21,710 --> 01:22:22,720
But... why?

828
01:22:23,720 --> 01:22:25,060
You ask me why?

829
01:22:26,690 --> 01:22:32,730
Why so angry? She brought them
to try to make up with us.

830
01:22:32,970 --> 01:22:36,380
The murderer stole that flour!
Can't you see?

831
01:22:38,900 --> 01:22:45,040
Can't you understand what I'm
trying to do here at this mine?

832
01:22:46,130 --> 01:22:52,080
I'm afraid not! How could I when
you never tell me anything?

833
01:22:52,760 --> 01:22:58,490
Of course, even I can guess where
the flour and sugar came from.

834
01:22:59,170 --> 01:23:04,070
But women can't always live by
hard-headed rules.

835
01:23:04,550 --> 01:23:06,820
I didn't accept for myself!

836
01:23:07,010 --> 01:23:11,300
Well, you needn't have bothered
accepting for me!

837
01:23:15,220 --> 01:23:20,740
Because it was the Okazaki's?
What if it were Mrs. Okishima?

838
01:23:21,610 --> 01:23:23,180
I'd still refuse!

839
01:23:25,090 --> 01:23:28,530
Yes... you're just the kind who would!

840
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:32,780
I understand you struck Chen...

841
01:23:36,340 --> 01:23:40,710
I know you didn't want to...
yet you did! Why?

842
01:23:42,420 --> 01:23:44,700
Because he committed a wrong?

843
01:23:46,660 --> 01:23:51,530
No! You could have forgiven him
such a minor matter.

844
01:23:52,430 --> 01:23:57,380
You did it because he made you
lose face in front of others.

845
01:23:58,290 --> 01:24:02,660
For one who plans great things
you've a small mind!

846
01:24:02,700 --> 01:24:04,380
It's all beyond you!

847
01:24:04,390 --> 01:24:05,550
That's not true!

848
01:24:07,210 --> 01:24:11,520
I even know what the people
are saying about you!

849
01:24:12,010 --> 01:24:13,410
And what are they saying?

850
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:19,720
That you try to take all the credit.

851
01:24:20,680 --> 01:24:25,870
I didn't believe them! I thought
it was merely spite... but now...

852
01:24:25,970 --> 01:24:27,230
Believe as you wish!

853
01:24:27,430 --> 01:24:28,400
Where are you going?

854
01:24:28,500 --> 01:24:30,100
I've kept thirty women waiting!

855
01:24:34,560 --> 01:24:38,380
Marriage? It's impossible!

856
01:24:40,430 --> 01:24:44,190
We can marry!
After the war is over.

857
01:24:45,320 --> 01:24:47,760
Is it ending soon?

858
01:24:49,550 --> 01:24:53,670
Not very long now... it will end.

859
01:24:54,590 --> 01:24:59,620
But... they'll take you away again!

860
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,220
No, Chun Lan.

861
01:25:03,640 --> 01:25:07,500
It is ending in victory for China.

862
01:25:11,310 --> 01:25:14,540
We are going to be free again!

863
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:22,080
I... I'd prefer things as they are.

864
01:25:22,580 --> 01:25:23,670
Why?

865
01:25:24,530 --> 01:25:25,540
Chun Lan!

866
01:25:26,680 --> 01:25:30,930
When that day comes,
I won't be able to see you.

867
01:25:31,460 --> 01:25:36,730
But... I'm asking you to marry me!

868
01:25:38,770 --> 01:25:40,770
There are plans to escape from here.

869
01:25:42,650 --> 01:25:46,940
But I will not run away
as long as you are here.

870
01:25:48,130 --> 01:25:52,730
Kao! You won't run away... you promise?

871
01:26:23,430 --> 01:26:26,860
It seems I'm running to extremes again.

872
01:26:45,630 --> 01:26:47,170
You brute!

873
01:26:53,080 --> 01:26:56,950
I'm thinking of helping
those two get married.

874
01:27:09,870 --> 01:27:11,700
Hello. What's that?

875
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:12,980
They escaped?

876
01:27:13,160 --> 01:27:15,430
Yes... we'll be right over!

877
01:27:15,470 --> 01:27:16,780
Eleven men! Escaped!

878
01:27:23,630 --> 01:27:26,910
I won't bother asking for information.

879
01:27:27,580 --> 01:27:31,120
We'll soon know who planned the break.

880
01:27:31,350 --> 01:27:34,330
I won't ask for details.

881
01:27:35,210 --> 01:27:38,540
But I want you to understand one thing.

882
01:27:40,150 --> 01:27:45,490
We've tried our best to help you.

883
01:27:45,490 --> 01:27:50,900
If you cannot trust us and
continue in your efforts to escape.

884
01:27:50,910 --> 01:27:54,000
those who remain behind
will face reprisals

885
01:27:54,010 --> 01:28:00,070
and a further increase of hard labour.

886
01:28:00,080 --> 01:28:04,490
And I will not raise a finger
to protect you!

887
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:10,380
You think that you can get away
with anything while here.

888
01:28:11,160 --> 01:28:13,040
But if Kaji and I decide to do so.

889
01:28:13,050 --> 01:28:20,850
we can always pack you into those
freight cars and send you back.

890
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,830
They escaped without our knowing!

891
01:28:24,840 --> 01:28:28,060
We only serve liaison purposes.

892
01:28:28,610 --> 01:28:32,810
We can't stop them even if
we learn of the plot.

893
01:28:32,980 --> 01:28:38,850
Don't lie! What if I said that
Wang Heng Li plotted this break?

894
01:28:39,190 --> 01:28:41,720
It no lie... we don't know!

895
01:28:42,240 --> 01:28:44,380
I no run away.

896
01:28:44,610 --> 01:28:49,680
You fools! Do you think we'd
take you words for it?

897
01:28:50,720 --> 01:28:53,070
I wish you'd all run away!

898
01:28:53,850 --> 01:29:00,090
I will not run!
I will stride boldly out of this compound.

899
01:29:00,220 --> 01:29:03,090
Where will you go after you leave?

900
01:29:05,770 --> 01:29:11,090
Not all Japanese are soft-hearted.
Run away and see for yourself.

901
01:29:11,090 --> 01:29:12,220
I will not keep you!

902
01:29:13,230 --> 01:29:17,940
Wang, whether this camp remains a haven

903
01:29:17,950 --> 01:29:19,170
depends on your future actions.

904
01:29:22,440 --> 01:29:27,810
Ultimate responsibility to the
KEMPEITAI lies with me... not you!

905
01:29:28,550 --> 01:29:30,860
Investigate the matter thoroughly.

906
01:29:31,500 --> 01:29:36,270
And find some alibi for the KEMPEITAI.

907
01:30:00,130 --> 01:30:01,580
Where's Kaji?

908
01:30:07,810 --> 01:30:10,470
You stood by while those men escaped?

909
01:30:10,780 --> 01:30:12,380
That's not true.

910
01:30:13,190 --> 01:30:16,380
You took all precautionary measures?

911
01:30:17,670 --> 01:30:19,290
Must you be reminded...

912
01:30:22,250 --> 01:30:24,900
That those prisoners cost us dearly?

913
01:30:26,390 --> 01:30:30,040
You damaged the prestige
of our imperial forces.

914
01:30:31,890 --> 01:30:33,140
Start explaining!

915
01:30:33,240 --> 01:30:34,270
What's to explain?

916
01:30:34,370 --> 01:30:38,140
The only explanation
is their desire to escape.

917
01:30:38,150 --> 01:30:40,260
Why did you let them escape?

918
01:30:41,460 --> 01:30:42,270
Answer me!

919
01:30:42,470 --> 01:30:43,940
There's no need to shout.

920
01:30:45,980 --> 01:30:51,530
We have 10,000 labourers here
aside from your prisoners.

921
01:30:51,630 --> 01:30:55,760
No matter how hard we try
they'll manage to escape.

922
01:30:58,480 --> 01:30:59,410
One question...

923
01:31:03,170 --> 01:31:04,080
OK.

924
01:31:04,570 --> 01:31:09,900
We reported the truth.
If I had reported them dead...

925
01:31:09,910 --> 01:31:12,190
I could have avoided
trouble with the KEMPEITEI.

926
01:31:12,900 --> 01:31:15,300
Doesn't the KEMPEITEI want the truth?

927
01:31:15,850 --> 01:31:17,620
I admit your honesty.

928
01:31:18,590 --> 01:31:22,010
But inadequate supervision
cannot be excused.

929
01:31:24,700 --> 01:31:30,090
I shall overlook your negligence
on this one occasion.

930
01:31:31,690 --> 01:31:33,610
No more men must be allowed to escape.

931
01:31:34,520 --> 01:31:38,840
If they do, I shall personally slay
the leader of that group.

932
01:31:39,360 --> 01:31:40,400
You understand?

933
01:31:40,990 --> 01:31:41,790
We understand.

934
01:31:44,740 --> 01:31:48,610
How about it?
Do you want me to intimidate them?

935
01:31:49,740 --> 01:31:51,040
It won't be necessary.

936
01:31:52,080 --> 01:31:56,960
Refusing aid from the military
indicates your supreme confidence.

937
01:31:58,290 --> 01:32:04,280
Hereafter, I'll hold you personally
responsible in this matter.

938
01:32:04,350 --> 01:32:05,250
I understand.

939
01:32:07,270 --> 01:32:10,710
And you? Do you understand?

940
01:32:12,930 --> 01:32:13,730
I do.

941
01:32:16,950 --> 01:32:18,150
That's all for today.

942
01:32:34,940 --> 01:32:36,290
No... wait!

943
01:32:40,530 --> 01:32:41,310
Wait!

944
01:32:43,810 --> 01:32:45,010
Leave me alone!

945
01:32:45,050 --> 01:32:47,520
Don't take it out on the men.

946
01:32:47,530 --> 01:32:53,180
You did! You struck Chen in a fit of temper!

947
01:32:53,280 --> 01:32:54,770
Don't try to pull your humanism on me.

948
01:32:54,780 --> 01:32:59,460
Yes... and I already regret it.
But why need you ape me?

949
01:32:59,740 --> 01:33:01,830
Don't let your ire ruin my work.

950
01:33:02,060 --> 01:33:03,000
Your job?

951
01:33:03,450 --> 01:33:04,520
Yes... my work!

952
01:33:07,780 --> 01:33:11,590
We've kept you in step so far
but you're turning away.

953
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:17,230
Can't you see? Force has meaning
only when overcoming tyranny.

954
01:33:17,330 --> 01:33:22,960
I know!. I've had enough of your lectures!
You intend to leave them alone?

955
01:33:23,710 --> 01:33:24,950
I'll talk to them.

956
01:33:30,320 --> 01:33:35,620
I mince no words! I don't want
your men to keep trying to escape.

957
01:33:39,580 --> 01:33:45,320
As far as you men are concerned,
l am your friendliest enemy.

958
01:33:45,330 --> 01:33:53,180
I pride myself in the fact that
there is no hostility in my work.

959
01:33:54,110 --> 01:33:58,720
Despite the dilemmas which come
of our being at war,

960
01:33:58,730 --> 01:34:03,680
I have tried to protect your interests.

961
01:34:03,780 --> 01:34:06,220
What you say... is difficult.

962
01:34:07,810 --> 01:34:13,070
Is it? Eat your fill.
We can talk at our leisure.

963
01:34:16,010 --> 01:34:19,660
When one of your comrades was killed...

964
01:34:20,310 --> 01:34:26,170
I did not adopt just measures
to protect you.

965
01:34:26,880 --> 01:34:31,050
Therefore, you no longer trust me.

966
01:34:31,060 --> 01:34:33,460
This is only natural.

967
01:34:34,110 --> 01:34:39,950
However... I shall do my utmost
to correct this mistake.

968
01:34:40,790 --> 01:34:44,350
This may take considerable time.

969
01:34:46,940 --> 01:34:51,200
But I hope you will trust me
and be patient.

970
01:34:53,280 --> 01:34:57,050
No one wishes to risk dangers
to break out?

971
01:34:58,040 --> 01:35:01,750
Let me speak for my friend, Kaji.

972
01:35:02,910 --> 01:35:05,770
Since Kaji arrived here...

973
01:35:05,780 --> 01:35:09,120
The labourers' has greatly improved.

974
01:35:09,320 --> 01:35:12,230
This also applies to you.

975
01:35:12,840 --> 01:35:16,680
However, if you continue to break out.

976
01:35:17,230 --> 01:35:20,570
I cannot say what the
KEMPEITAI might do.

977
01:35:23,400 --> 01:35:25,990
I don't know how Kaji feels.

978
01:35:26,800 --> 01:35:32,530
But the only way to save my own neck...

979
01:35:32,540 --> 01:35:34,650
is to send you back to the KEMPEITAI.

980
01:35:35,790 --> 01:35:38,580
He speaks no falsehoods.

981
01:35:38,800 --> 01:35:42,400
We can talk over our mutual problems.

982
01:35:45,480 --> 01:35:48,130
How about you, Kao?

983
01:35:48,260 --> 01:35:54,860
If you can marry Yang Chun Lan,
will you stay until the war ends?

984
01:35:55,590 --> 01:35:58,840
Tales which begin with the word "if"

985
01:36:01,100 --> 01:36:02,800
Do not interest me.

986
01:36:05,370 --> 01:36:09,820
Can't you understand?
We want to talk things over.

987
01:36:09,830 --> 01:36:11,050
Fawning toad-eater!

988
01:36:13,070 --> 01:36:16,090
It's the same old Japanese trick!

989
01:36:16,920 --> 01:36:22,690
They always promise to do this
and to do that...

990
01:36:25,640 --> 01:36:27,820
But they never carry it out.

991
01:36:28,570 --> 01:36:29,480
Stand up!

992
01:36:32,460 --> 01:36:38,290
You dog! Go to Yang Chun Lan and
learn the ways of human beings.

993
01:36:46,380 --> 01:36:49,460
By the way, Wang... if I...

994
01:36:50,840 --> 01:36:52,640
There's the "if" again.

995
01:36:53,760 --> 01:37:00,070
If I gain for you the freedom
enjoyed by other labourers,

996
01:37:00,430 --> 01:37:02,130
will you promise to remain here?

997
01:37:03,780 --> 01:37:08,070
To wait seems to be
the only safe liberty.

998
01:37:08,830 --> 01:37:09,680
You promise?

999
01:37:13,730 --> 01:37:16,910
Wang... you must trust me!

1000
01:37:33,930 --> 01:37:36,050
Do you think they trust me?

1001
01:37:36,800 --> 01:37:38,580
You want to believe they do?

1002
01:37:40,100 --> 01:37:44,180
I want to believe Wang
when he said that he'd wait.

1003
01:37:47,110 --> 01:37:51,290
You plan to continue sending
the girls inside? Why?

1004
01:37:51,490 --> 01:37:52,450
Just a hunch...

1005
01:37:53,760 --> 01:37:58,490
And I also plan to take about
50 men for outside work.

1006
01:37:58,490 --> 01:37:59,810
With guards?

1007
01:37:59,910 --> 01:38:01,490
No... just myself.

1008
01:38:02,630 --> 01:38:05,260
Such strange hunches aren't like you.

1009
01:38:06,930 --> 01:38:08,340
Why not be honest?

1010
01:38:08,540 --> 01:38:09,170
What about?

1011
01:38:10,020 --> 01:38:14,040
Admit that you'd let them
escape... if you could!

1012
01:38:14,860 --> 01:38:16,080
That's nonsense.

1013
01:38:16,090 --> 01:38:20,620
When that happens, I stand to lose
my neck, too. Remember that!

1014
01:38:41,360 --> 01:38:44,630
When they come here, they seem happy.

1015
01:38:47,580 --> 01:38:49,010
Your mother... is she still ill?

1016
01:38:50,590 --> 01:38:51,290
Yes.

1017
01:38:53,630 --> 01:38:56,500
Does she still yearn
for white flour?

1018
01:38:57,850 --> 01:38:59,080
She's given up hope.

1019
01:39:02,960 --> 01:39:04,900
I'm sorry that I struck you.

1020
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:10,330
I'm hard-headed in some ways... I know!

1021
01:39:10,530 --> 01:39:11,670
That's all right.

1022
01:39:18,930 --> 01:39:23,290
Is Sai who works at the
power station a friend of yours?

1023
01:39:25,880 --> 01:39:26,610
Yes.

1024
01:39:28,850 --> 01:39:30,560
The current was shut off...

1025
01:39:32,670 --> 01:39:34,340
And Sai was on duty that night.

1026
01:39:37,740 --> 01:39:40,530
If he did it, he mustn't do it again.

1027
01:39:42,690 --> 01:39:44,380
All right! Back to work!

1028
01:39:51,250 --> 01:39:53,550
They could have run away.

1029
01:39:53,650 --> 01:39:55,660
They're beginning to trust you.

1030
01:39:56,840 --> 01:40:01,000
No... they're just being wary.
They fear a trap.

1031
01:40:02,940 --> 01:40:04,680
You're giving it up?

1032
01:40:06,310 --> 01:40:08,220
No... I'll continue.

1033
01:40:10,080 --> 01:40:13,700
It's dangerous!
They might kill you and escape.

1034
01:40:14,710 --> 01:40:15,960
I don't think so.

1035
01:40:16,980 --> 01:40:18,370
This bath feels good!

1036
01:40:19,840 --> 01:40:21,740
Why don't you come in, too?

1037
01:40:24,250 --> 01:40:25,200
I think I will.

1038
01:40:28,180 --> 01:40:31,940
If the labourers calm down,
let's go on a vacation.

1039
01:40:33,320 --> 01:40:37,240
Let's do it! How many days
can you take off?

1040
01:40:37,900 --> 01:40:39,360
Three days... at most!

1041
01:40:40,470 --> 01:40:41,840
That's wonderful!

1042
01:40:43,850 --> 01:40:45,920
Well... if they really calm down...

1043
01:40:47,480 --> 01:40:50,900
Some day you'll be a great supervisor...

1044
01:40:50,910 --> 01:40:54,050
But youth will have vanished by then.

1045
01:40:54,860 --> 01:40:56,220
That's not for me!

1046
01:40:57,320 --> 01:41:00,970
You win!
What you say is probably the truth.

1047
01:41:02,080 --> 01:41:03,130
Will you?

1048
01:41:03,330 --> 01:41:04,880
Sure... we'll go.

1049
01:41:14,680 --> 01:41:18,180
Make no mistakes, Cho...
fix that barbed wire!

1050
01:41:18,640 --> 01:41:24,500
Kaji will be off on a 3-day leave.
We'll do it while he's away.

1051
01:41:24,510 --> 01:41:28,250
There's more of a profit in it
but it's more dangerous.

1052
01:41:30,950 --> 01:41:35,290
With things going smoothly,
Kaji has relaxed his guard.

1053
01:41:36,820 --> 01:41:38,760
But watch out for Okishima!

1054
01:41:41,190 --> 01:41:43,280
It's an ideal chance!

1055
01:41:44,020 --> 01:41:48,070
Let's pull another fast one
and make ourselves scarce.

1056
01:41:51,230 --> 01:41:55,070
Yeah... getting away is the
important thing.

1057
01:42:03,360 --> 01:42:05,030
Is Jin Tung Fu in?

1058
01:42:05,360 --> 01:42:08,620
She's in bed with the cute one.

1059
01:42:11,350 --> 01:42:13,240
How about you?

1060
01:42:27,240 --> 01:42:31,180
I'm having trouble!
Chen won't help any more.

1061
01:42:31,200 --> 01:42:31,830
He won't do it.

1062
01:42:34,100 --> 01:42:36,740
Once is as bad as 100 times!

1063
01:42:36,770 --> 01:42:39,000
He dislikes our company.

1064
01:42:39,010 --> 01:42:42,110
Oh? Except when he's in bed with you?

1065
01:42:42,680 --> 01:42:45,000
He wants me to break away, too.

1066
01:42:45,980 --> 01:42:48,170
Has the dog squealed on us?

1067
01:42:48,330 --> 01:42:49,650
He wouldn't do that!

1068
01:42:49,750 --> 01:42:50,580
How do you know?

1069
01:42:53,660 --> 01:42:55,700
Don't stop him. Send him home!

1070
01:43:16,330 --> 01:43:20,710
Hey, Jin Tung Fu is some woman, eh?
Was it good?

1071
01:43:21,290 --> 01:43:24,780
I hear Kaji is going
on leave this Saturday.

1072
01:43:25,540 --> 01:43:27,720
Have the power cut while he's gone.

1073
01:43:29,170 --> 01:43:32,030
Sai isn't going on duty
during those nights.

1074
01:43:32,220 --> 01:43:33,030
Well then when?

1075
01:43:34,150 --> 01:43:35,540
Friday night.

1076
01:43:35,590 --> 01:43:37,670
Then make it Friday night.

1077
01:43:38,920 --> 01:43:40,990
He can't! He's under suspicion.

1078
01:43:41,090 --> 01:43:41,920
By who?

1079
01:43:43,460 --> 01:43:44,400
Mr. Kaji...

1080
01:43:46,020 --> 01:43:52,520
What can he do without evidence?
Listen carefully, you brat!

1081
01:43:53,280 --> 01:43:58,890
Play it straight and I'll fix it
so Jin Tung Fu will be all yours.

1082
01:44:13,310 --> 01:44:16,830
You'll do it...
you'll be a good boy!

1083
01:44:17,200 --> 01:44:20,640
If you refuse...
you and Sai will die!

1084
01:44:31,300 --> 01:44:33,450
Oh! I feel great!

1085
01:44:33,680 --> 01:44:38,600
We arrived in a whirl of dust
but it's nice today! You're worried?

1086
01:44:38,700 --> 01:44:42,240
I'm wondering why I didn't
do this before.

1087
01:44:42,250 --> 01:44:43,010
Really?

1088
01:44:43,020 --> 01:44:44,070
I mean it!

1089
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:48,480
When we arrive in town,
l must phone Yasuko.

1090
01:44:49,600 --> 01:44:50,440
Do you mind?

1091
01:44:51,590 --> 01:44:52,360
And then?

1092
01:44:53,090 --> 01:44:58,190
And then we'll have lunch together and
go to the apple orchard.

1093
01:44:59,250 --> 01:45:03,810
It's all so wonderful...
l feel as light as a balloon!

1094
01:45:13,800 --> 01:45:15,420
I beg just one liberty.

1095
01:45:16,540 --> 01:45:17,440
What's that?

1096
01:45:17,630 --> 01:45:20,060
Just one hour... will you let me go?

1097
01:45:20,760 --> 01:45:21,840
What for?

1098
01:45:23,230 --> 01:45:26,910
Our record is improving,
I want to see the director...

1099
01:45:26,920 --> 01:45:30,180
About the status of the prisoners.

1100
01:45:31,350 --> 01:45:32,720
Just one hour?

1101
01:45:32,730 --> 01:45:36,410
Yes. The remainder is all yours.

1102
01:45:36,490 --> 01:45:41,420
All right! I'll give you 2 hours,
But not a minute more!

1103
01:45:41,690 --> 01:45:43,210
Mr. Kaji!

1104
01:45:49,790 --> 01:45:50,880
Mr. Kaji!

1105
01:45:59,320 --> 01:46:00,510
They escaped again!

1106
01:46:00,680 --> 01:46:01,250
What?

1107
01:46:03,220 --> 01:46:04,250
And Okishima?

1108
01:46:04,470 --> 01:46:06,050
He's over at their camp.

1109
01:46:06,850 --> 01:46:08,360
OK. I'll go right away.

1110
01:46:15,820 --> 01:46:17,150
No... please!

1111
01:46:18,950 --> 01:46:22,170
It can't be helped, but I can't go now.

1112
01:46:23,750 --> 01:46:26,880
Go on alone and have
a good time with Yasuko.

1113
01:46:29,300 --> 01:46:30,820
It's not Yasuko... I want you!

1114
01:46:30,890 --> 01:46:31,560
But this is my job.

1115
01:46:31,600 --> 01:46:34,770
I don't care! You're on vacation.

1116
01:46:35,260 --> 01:46:37,230
Why do you have to go back now?

1117
01:46:38,470 --> 01:46:40,340
Leave it to Okishima...

1118
01:46:40,350 --> 01:46:41,280
I can't do that.

1119
01:46:41,290 --> 01:46:42,670
It can wait till after lunch, right?

1120
01:46:43,110 --> 01:46:44,750
I'll never make it.

1121
01:46:47,170 --> 01:46:48,820
You don't want to do!

1122
01:46:48,970 --> 01:46:49,660
Stop it!

1123
01:46:52,990 --> 01:46:54,750
Your work's important...yes!

1124
01:46:55,200 --> 01:46:58,110
But do you know
how important this is to us?

1125
01:46:58,210 --> 01:46:59,450
I'll make up for it!

1126
01:47:00,660 --> 01:47:02,300
You needn't bother!

1127
01:47:03,140 --> 01:47:05,530
Why the fuss over such a tiny matter?

1128
01:47:09,220 --> 01:47:10,460
Such a tiny matter?

1129
01:47:12,710 --> 01:47:16,420
You don't care
how I feel about it.

1130
01:47:17,180 --> 01:47:20,250
At any rate, there's no way I can leave now.

1131
01:47:22,350 --> 01:47:26,010
I see! Then I'll go by myself.

1132
01:47:50,990 --> 01:47:51,610
Stop it!

1133
01:47:54,940 --> 01:47:56,980
From now on, I do things my own way!

1134
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:00,780
And ruin everything I've done?

1135
01:48:00,790 --> 01:48:01,950
This is the only way of
making them understand!

1136
01:48:02,050 --> 01:48:03,750
Brute force solves nothing!

1137
01:48:04,690 --> 01:48:06,230
Do you realize how many got away?

1138
01:48:06,600 --> 01:48:10,600
18 men escaped led by Hwang and Sung!

1139
01:48:10,610 --> 01:48:12,720
You still want to talk it over?

1140
01:48:12,820 --> 01:48:14,980
I'll assume all responsibility.

1141
01:48:14,990 --> 01:48:15,940
Foolish!

1142
01:48:16,040 --> 01:48:21,560
If you don't like my methods,
you can quit and save your own neck.

1143
01:48:25,460 --> 01:48:26,900
OK. I accept your offer.

1144
01:48:35,020 --> 01:48:35,580
Wang!

1145
01:48:39,440 --> 01:48:40,140
Stand up!

1146
01:48:42,150 --> 01:48:45,800
I've despaired of you all!
You gave your word.

1147
01:48:45,810 --> 01:48:50,580
I may seem like a fool to you
but now I've had enough!

1148
01:48:58,830 --> 01:49:01,690
Another break and you all go
without food for 3 days.

1149
01:49:02,360 --> 01:49:06,400
I'll break your authority in the camp.

1150
01:49:06,760 --> 01:49:11,010
All Japanese are the same!
Devils!

1151
01:49:11,020 --> 01:49:16,130
So be it! I shall act accordingly.
All promises are hereby retracted.

1152
01:49:17,190 --> 01:49:21,370
I realize now that there can be
no truth between us.

1153
01:49:23,350 --> 01:49:24,360
Mr. Okishima!

1154
01:49:35,720 --> 01:49:37,940
And the report to the KEMPEITAI?

1155
01:49:39,050 --> 01:49:41,060
We're in for it this time!

1156
01:49:42,730 --> 01:49:44,530
I won't report the incident.

1157
01:49:44,740 --> 01:49:45,380
What?

1158
01:49:47,680 --> 01:49:51,530
If it leaks out,
I'll assume all responsibility.

1159
01:49:52,400 --> 01:49:55,290
I know it's not all your fault.

1160
01:49:57,830 --> 01:50:00,580
You think someone shut off the power?

1161
01:50:01,720 --> 01:50:02,900
I couldn't say.

1162
01:50:03,810 --> 01:50:06,150
How about a Japanese night shift?

1163
01:50:06,450 --> 01:50:09,120
We couldn't... without evidence.

1164
01:50:11,370 --> 01:50:14,050
Should I increase the night watch?

1165
01:50:14,860 --> 01:50:19,240
I'd have to check each night
to see if they're on duty.

1166
01:50:20,810 --> 01:50:24,000
Eighteen men... that's a big loss!

1167
01:50:24,720 --> 01:50:28,810
I've achieved our new production goal...

1168
01:50:28,820 --> 01:50:31,530
and I want no trouble of such nature.

1169
01:50:41,840 --> 01:50:46,560
May I report that Okishima is herewith

1170
01:50:46,570 --> 01:50:48,230
relieved of all responsibility
for the prisoners?

1171
01:51:07,270 --> 01:51:09,310
Tell me!

1172
01:51:10,250 --> 01:51:12,690
Who paid you the money?

1173
01:51:16,680 --> 01:51:22,270
Okishima favours aggressive measures
but Kaji always vetoes him.

1174
01:51:22,780 --> 01:51:26,980
Meaning he gives tacit
consent to the runways?

1175
01:51:27,770 --> 01:51:33,430
I wouldn't say that...
but it does all seem rather suspicious.

1176
01:51:39,200 --> 01:51:42,370
There is one way
we can teach them a lesson.

1177
01:51:42,750 --> 01:51:43,710
How's that?

1178
01:51:46,410 --> 01:51:49,940
Let them plan another break,
and we'll foil them.

1179
01:51:51,440 --> 01:51:53,890
With your permission, I'd like to try.

1180
01:51:55,610 --> 01:52:00,550
Sounds interesting! If it brings
results, I'll try anything.

1181
01:52:02,060 --> 01:52:03,170
Give it a try.

1182
01:52:04,240 --> 01:52:09,140
Boss's orders...
flour and oil rations

1183
01:52:09,680 --> 01:52:11,100
for just the Japanese of course!

1184
01:52:12,360 --> 01:52:13,970
I'm sure you don't approve.

1185
01:52:15,440 --> 01:52:16,370
I do not!

1186
01:52:18,040 --> 01:52:21,900
Unfortunately however,
you're not the manager.

1187
01:52:23,510 --> 01:52:26,040
It's fortunate for you that I'm not!

1188
01:52:28,220 --> 01:52:31,090
Mr. Kaji! It's Mr. Okishima...

1189
01:52:47,930 --> 01:52:49,390
Kill the rat!

1190
01:53:00,080 --> 01:53:03,260
Let us take care
of this Korean dog!

1191
01:53:04,180 --> 01:53:05,260
You stay out of this!

1192
01:53:08,160 --> 01:53:11,150
Swipe men from under my nose, eh?

1193
01:53:27,640 --> 01:53:28,790
Not stopping me today?

1194
01:53:29,530 --> 01:53:30,450
You want me to?

1195
01:53:31,180 --> 01:53:36,990
You disapprove? Should I lay off
the ordinary labourers, too?

1196
01:53:37,940 --> 01:53:43,960
Your so-called humanism is apt to
harbour rascals like this one.

1197
01:53:44,120 --> 01:53:46,110
Chen... the medical ward!

1198
01:53:46,200 --> 01:53:50,110
Leave the cur be!
His boss will pick him up.

1199
01:53:50,120 --> 01:53:50,940
Take him!

1200
01:54:00,910 --> 01:54:02,600
Call... Furuya...

1201
01:54:03,580 --> 01:54:07,440
Don't worry, young one!
They can't make me talk.

1202
01:54:23,010 --> 01:54:28,810
Chen... it seems I know more about you
than you do about me.

1203
01:54:31,410 --> 01:54:39,070
Go tell Kaji the wounds are slight.
We don't want him around here.

1204
01:55:02,970 --> 01:55:04,040
Well? How is he?

1205
01:55:05,290 --> 01:55:06,290
He'll be all right.

1206
01:55:08,260 --> 01:55:09,700
Mr. Furuya is with him.

1207
01:55:10,380 --> 01:55:11,150
Furuya?

1208
01:55:15,290 --> 01:55:19,280
Furuya... send a telegram to Muta...

1209
01:55:20,490 --> 01:55:21,870
That rat Okishima!

1210
01:55:41,310 --> 01:55:44,430
The man says he'll sue Okishima.

1211
01:55:44,710 --> 01:55:47,820
Help him arrange it. He's your friend.

1212
01:55:49,310 --> 01:55:52,180
You needn't explain! I'm not that dumb.

1213
01:55:53,070 --> 01:55:56,610
Was it money?
Or just to make trouble for me?

1214
01:55:58,210 --> 01:56:00,640
Don't worry!
I won't tell the boss.

1215
01:56:02,590 --> 01:56:05,680
See that your buddy is hospitalized.

1216
01:56:05,930 --> 01:56:09,320
But you're paying for him... not labour!

1217
01:56:10,710 --> 01:56:12,870
You've already made enough.

1218
01:56:19,340 --> 01:56:21,060
What kept you so long?

1219
01:56:22,370 --> 01:56:25,480
What's wrong with you? You're drunk!

1220
01:56:27,270 --> 01:56:29,360
You think I came to make trouble?

1221
01:56:30,330 --> 01:56:33,690
I had a drink with the boss
but I'm not drunk.

1222
01:56:39,390 --> 01:56:45,160
I bring tidings! They're issuing
commendations to the deserving.

1223
01:56:46,530 --> 01:56:48,220
Okazaki will get one of them.

1224
01:56:49,780 --> 01:56:53,820
I told the boss that you were the one

1225
01:56:54,220 --> 01:56:57,370
who earned the award in the labour end.

1226
01:57:00,530 --> 01:57:02,530
The boss felt the same but he feared

1227
01:57:03,300 --> 01:57:06,940
that it might hurt my feelings?

1228
01:57:10,270 --> 01:57:13,160
Do you think it would hurt my feelings?

1229
01:57:17,110 --> 01:57:19,500
Why have you turned to brute force?

1230
01:57:21,390 --> 01:57:26,490
The boss asked the same question.
Just say... I was born a brute.

1231
01:57:30,930 --> 01:57:33,650
How long will you carry on as you are?

1232
01:57:34,170 --> 01:57:35,180
What do you mean by that?

1233
01:57:36,560 --> 01:57:41,820
You're ignoring the contradictions
and trying to justify them.

1234
01:57:45,700 --> 01:57:51,580
I ran out of breath waiting.
If I'm in your way, just say so.

1235
01:58:20,340 --> 01:58:21,580
Lao Kao!

1236
01:58:58,880 --> 01:58:59,590
Lao Kao!

1237
01:59:04,650 --> 01:59:05,300
Jin!

1238
01:59:06,250 --> 01:59:09,400
I was afraid you
might have escaped.

1239
01:59:11,730 --> 01:59:13,930
That is all I could buy today.

1240
01:59:15,090 --> 01:59:15,790
Thank you.

1241
01:59:17,300 --> 01:59:18,310
Thank you greatly.

1242
01:59:37,760 --> 01:59:41,550
We can't meet for the time being.

1243
01:59:43,170 --> 01:59:46,670
I... I won't be able to come here.

1244
01:59:48,160 --> 01:59:50,150
If you run off by yourself...

1245
01:59:50,790 --> 01:59:53,280
I'll die on this fence.

1246
01:59:55,140 --> 01:59:57,910
I'll take you with me when I escape.

1247
01:59:58,410 --> 01:59:59,430
When will that be?

1248
02:00:01,170 --> 02:00:05,460
After I learn how the others have fared.

1249
02:00:05,470 --> 02:00:11,170
I can't take any chances with you
accompanying me.

1250
02:00:12,120 --> 02:00:13,340
You will stay here?

1251
02:00:14,920 --> 02:00:18,110
They might let us be married.

1252
02:00:18,990 --> 02:00:20,590
Don't believe them!

1253
02:00:21,620 --> 02:00:26,430
The learned Wang says the war
will soon end.

1254
02:00:28,040 --> 02:00:30,880
Japan will be defeated.

1255
02:00:32,560 --> 02:00:34,740
Now that I have you...

1256
02:00:35,720 --> 02:00:39,630
I'm willing to bear anything.

1257
02:00:41,250 --> 02:00:42,180
Lao Kao.

1258
02:00:43,960 --> 02:00:49,040
I wish we could meet
like this every night.

1259
02:00:50,680 --> 02:00:57,180
But... it's better not to come so often.

1260
02:00:58,710 --> 02:01:00,620
They'll become suspicious.

1261
02:01:03,100 --> 02:01:04,280
This cursed wire!

1262
02:01:04,290 --> 02:01:04,860
Watch out!

1263
02:01:06,250 --> 02:01:10,040
God is unjust!

1264
02:01:13,840 --> 02:01:18,870
Chun. I love you!

1265
02:01:19,870 --> 02:01:24,580
Lao Kao. And I love you!

1266
02:02:14,050 --> 02:02:15,180
Can't you sleep?

1267
02:02:17,690 --> 02:02:21,210
Kaji would have been happier
if he had married a girl like you.

1268
02:02:21,610 --> 02:02:22,480
Probably.

1269
02:02:23,660 --> 02:02:25,600
You're too much the wife, Michi.

1270
02:02:26,520 --> 02:02:28,740
You're forgetting to be a woman.

1271
02:02:30,080 --> 02:02:31,330
What do you mean?

1272
02:02:33,140 --> 02:02:38,170
Being a wife is a profession.
But it's the woman that men love.

1273
02:02:39,730 --> 02:02:44,960
When you typed Kaji’s reports,
you studied it like one possessed.

1274
02:02:47,700 --> 02:02:49,540
I never understood a word.

1275
02:02:50,050 --> 02:02:53,550
And now? Do you talk about his work?

1276
02:02:55,550 --> 02:02:57,640
He hates my pestering him.

1277
02:02:58,450 --> 02:03:02,650
If I were you, I'd pester him
until he told me about everything.

1278
02:03:02,660 --> 02:03:06,730
Then... I'd ask more questions.

1279
02:03:11,430 --> 02:03:15,090
What's wrong? Was I too outspoken?

1280
02:05:00,860 --> 02:05:02,390
I wanted to apologize.

1281
02:05:03,790 --> 02:05:06,470
I was a poor wife... and a poor woman.

1282
02:05:11,920 --> 02:05:13,410
I couldn't sleep.

1283
02:05:15,720 --> 02:05:20,420
This is your home... lie down
and get a good rest.

1284
02:05:23,020 --> 02:05:28,630
Promise me... that you'll share
your joys and sorrows with me.

1285
02:05:31,060 --> 02:05:33,180
Sorrow for one is enough.

1286
02:05:33,190 --> 02:05:38,060
It's not! The road which you take
is also the road for me.

1287
02:05:39,050 --> 02:05:43,620
What matters if we get lost?
l want you to take me along.

1288
02:05:45,820 --> 02:05:47,590
I will follow you.

1289
02:05:48,810 --> 02:05:50,950
And I'll do my best to keep up.

1290
02:05:54,480 --> 02:05:55,380
I understand.

1291
02:05:56,300 --> 02:06:01,170
If I'm slow... will you slow down
just a tiny bit?

1292
02:06:02,020 --> 02:06:03,840
Just a very tiny bit?

1293
02:06:05,470 --> 02:06:06,670
Of course.

1294
02:06:08,340 --> 02:06:11,050
I won't repeat a question twice.

1295
02:06:17,670 --> 02:06:22,060
Through fitting leadership in the pit

1296
02:06:22,260 --> 02:06:28,110
you have helped achieve the 20%
increase in ore production.

1297
02:06:28,660 --> 02:06:31,940
You have rendered valuable
service to our armed forces

1298
02:06:31,950 --> 02:06:40,320
and have proven yourself a fitting
example for other employees.

1299
02:06:40,520 --> 02:06:46,930
You are herewith officially commended.

1300
02:06:46,940 --> 02:06:49,180
Chairman of the Board, Jushiro Kitada.

1301
02:06:49,190 --> 02:06:53,250
Read in proxy by Junichi Kuroki.

1302
02:07:20,700 --> 02:07:22,650
Looks like we'll have rain.

1303
02:07:25,330 --> 02:07:27,960
Rainy nights are ideal for escapes.

1304
02:07:40,830 --> 02:07:47,150
When you deliver their food,
tell them they can break out tonight.

1305
02:07:47,670 --> 02:07:48,590
Tonight?

1306
02:07:49,650 --> 02:07:51,800
Then you go to the power station

1307
02:07:52,340 --> 02:07:56,050
and say that Kaji wants the power cut...

1308
02:07:56,520 --> 02:07:57,950
But... Mr. Kaji.

1309
02:08:00,290 --> 02:08:03,110
I'm under direct orders from the boss.

1310
02:08:04,020 --> 02:08:07,580
You want me to tell
the KEMPEITAI about you?

1311
02:08:11,210 --> 02:08:14,830
About how you and Jin Tung Fu
helped them escape?

1312
02:08:15,840 --> 02:08:20,590
And how Kaji knew about it but
pretended not to notice?

1313
02:08:33,600 --> 02:08:37,050
It's the only way to save your neck.

1314
02:09:11,420 --> 02:09:16,270
Mr. Kaji, I look forward to
your continued favours.

1315
02:09:18,010 --> 02:09:20,890
You're young... but you're quite a fellow!

1316
02:09:22,150 --> 02:09:28,820
On the day you first came...
when it was snowing...

1317
02:09:28,920 --> 02:09:30,670
No... just windy!

1318
02:09:31,080 --> 02:09:33,830
Was that right?
On that day, I thought

1319
02:09:33,840 --> 02:09:39,610
that a young squirt like you
could never handle this mine.

1320
02:09:40,650 --> 02:09:44,850
However... things did work out
as you said.

1321
02:09:45,050 --> 02:09:46,780
You're really great!

1322
02:09:49,080 --> 02:09:58,140
But, Mr. Kaji... I've been watching.
You haven't been drinking...

1323
02:10:09,270 --> 02:10:11,290
Lend me a hand.

1324
02:10:17,080 --> 02:10:20,420
If you want to try,
tonight is your last chance.

1325
02:10:21,770 --> 02:10:24,210
Why this suddenness?

1326
02:10:25,100 --> 02:10:26,490
Let it pass if it's inconvenient.

1327
02:10:27,540 --> 02:10:36,420
But my friend is being shifted
to day duty from tomorrow.

1328
02:10:37,020 --> 02:10:39,700
There's no mistake?

1329
02:10:42,200 --> 02:10:50,240
On behalf of the men in the pit
and for the sake of friendship,

1330
02:10:50,690 --> 02:10:56,210
I challenge Mr. Kaji to
a friendly drinking bout.

1331
02:10:56,220 --> 02:10:56,980
Here here!

1332
02:10:59,590 --> 02:11:01,090
I'm beaten already.

1333
02:11:01,090 --> 02:11:07,860
No... that won't do! You can't be...
we haven't started yet!

1334
02:11:07,960 --> 02:11:09,300
I'm really beaten.

1335
02:11:09,740 --> 02:11:15,340
Does your spirit show only
when you're snarling to me?

1336
02:11:19,240 --> 02:11:22,310
Come on... take it like a man!

1337
02:11:22,510 --> 02:11:23,060
Right!

1338
02:11:23,560 --> 02:11:25,750
Good! If you want to drink...

1339
02:11:29,670 --> 02:11:30,790
Drink with this!

1340
02:11:31,640 --> 02:11:34,340
Get drunk and let down your guard.

1341
02:11:34,380 --> 02:11:35,520
He's right!

1342
02:11:36,190 --> 02:11:36,920
Okay!

1343
02:11:40,790 --> 02:11:41,940
Good luck Mr. Kaji!

1344
02:11:46,880 --> 02:11:50,080
There he goes!

1345
02:11:52,720 --> 02:11:57,580
They can take it! They're used to
being wined and dined.

1346
02:11:57,790 --> 02:12:01,400
Women, too! They run the whorehouse
and have their pick.

1347
02:12:03,550 --> 02:12:10,430
We're wined and dined, eh?
And the whores are ours for the taking?

1348
02:12:11,900 --> 02:12:16,030
Bring on your wine and women!
I'll take 'em on!

1349
02:12:27,140 --> 02:12:27,740
Chen.

1350
02:12:32,960 --> 02:12:34,130
Delivered their meal?

1351
02:12:40,710 --> 02:12:45,830
Special flour rations for the Japanese.
You're welcome to mine.

1352
02:12:46,590 --> 02:12:47,460
But your wife.

1353
02:12:47,530 --> 02:12:49,190
My wife has abandoned hope.

1354
02:12:50,990 --> 02:12:51,810
Mr. Kaji...

1355
02:12:55,840 --> 02:12:56,800
It's nothing.

1356
02:12:58,430 --> 02:13:01,950
I just wanted to say, "Thank you."

1357
02:13:03,750 --> 02:13:09,680
I should say "Thank you." I was afraid
you wouldn't accept it from me.

1358
02:13:51,770 --> 02:13:53,300
That's a shapely rump!

1359
02:14:02,170 --> 02:14:05,090
Stop it! You act like a dog in heat.

1360
02:14:05,920 --> 02:14:07,120
What do you mean?

1361
02:14:07,150 --> 02:14:09,930
Sow your seed in your own paddy field!

1362
02:14:11,800 --> 02:14:14,300
I wouldn't act so big, Okishima!

1363
02:14:14,960 --> 02:14:20,090
If guys like you and Kaji would
mind your own business,

1364
02:14:20,100 --> 02:14:23,910
I could have topped our goal long ago.

1365
02:14:23,920 --> 02:14:29,190
And if we hadn't butted in,
you'd have 10 killings to your credit.

1366
02:14:30,040 --> 02:14:32,090
And be dining in the pen.

1367
02:14:34,050 --> 02:14:37,310
You rat! If you want trouble, come on!

1368
02:15:19,750 --> 02:15:22,160
Hey! Chen... what's the matter?

1369
02:15:34,820 --> 02:15:36,070
What should I do?

1370
02:15:37,940 --> 02:15:40,560
I won't be able to see you again.

1371
02:15:42,130 --> 02:15:45,080
I've fallen into a trap.

1372
02:15:46,130 --> 02:15:50,320
Go to the station and have him
cut off the power.

1373
02:15:51,680 --> 02:15:53,360
If I should do so

1374
02:15:54,920 --> 02:15:57,220
and the men are captured...

1375
02:15:59,000 --> 02:16:01,660
They'll kill me!

1376
02:16:02,460 --> 02:16:03,690
This is a Japanese plot.

1377
02:16:03,980 --> 02:16:12,400
No matter what happens,
you won't be killed for doing what they ask.

1378
02:16:13,220 --> 02:16:17,490
You talk as if it didn't concern you.

1379
02:16:19,070 --> 02:16:23,420
If I'm caught, I might confess everything.

1380
02:16:23,810 --> 02:16:25,520
Don't frighten me.

1381
02:16:26,130 --> 02:16:28,530
You dragged me into this.

1382
02:16:30,360 --> 02:16:31,340
Where are you going?

1383
02:16:31,350 --> 02:16:32,650
I'll warn them!

1384
02:16:32,750 --> 02:16:35,410
You'll never get word to them.

1385
02:16:35,510 --> 02:16:36,690
I can try.

1386
02:16:37,280 --> 02:16:40,780
Wait! I have a better idea.

1387
02:16:47,030 --> 02:16:47,760
Chun Lan.

1388
02:16:48,490 --> 02:16:49,360
Chun Lan.

1389
02:16:52,890 --> 02:16:55,710
Kao is breaking out tonight.

1390
02:16:57,880 --> 02:16:58,800
Kao is escaping?

1391
02:16:58,810 --> 02:17:02,230
Tell him it's dangerous tonight.

1392
02:17:03,020 --> 02:17:04,800
I won't let him escape alone!

1393
02:18:17,120 --> 02:18:19,560
Drink it! It will relax you.

1394
02:18:45,850 --> 02:18:50,370
I couldn't contact him!
Are you sure he's escaping?

1395
02:18:50,680 --> 02:18:52,150
You met no one?

1396
02:18:52,560 --> 02:18:56,540
With this downpour,
I couldn't see a thing.

1397
02:18:56,960 --> 02:18:58,810
Not a soul?

1398
02:18:59,390 --> 02:19:01,860
Is he really breaking out?

1399
02:19:01,910 --> 02:19:04,560
What'll we do now?

1400
02:19:04,860 --> 02:19:08,240
If he runs off by himself...

1401
02:19:08,250 --> 02:19:09,810
I'll kill myself!

1402
02:19:14,740 --> 02:19:19,690
The power must be cut off!
We mustn't anger the Japanese.

1403
02:19:49,180 --> 02:19:50,300
What will you do?

1404
02:19:51,190 --> 02:19:56,680
The best way is to confess
the whole thing to Mr. Kaji.

1405
02:19:56,690 --> 02:20:00,550
Don't! He's the severest of them all.

1406
02:20:01,050 --> 02:20:02,260
Where are you going?

1407
02:20:10,630 --> 02:20:12,510
Go to the station!

1408
02:21:17,290 --> 02:21:21,680
I expected so much!
Did you do as I told you?

1409
02:21:22,570 --> 02:21:24,770
I did.

1410
02:21:25,670 --> 02:21:29,780
You didn't mention the matter
to Kaji, did you?

1411
02:21:30,520 --> 02:21:31,810
I didn't.

1412
02:21:32,780 --> 02:21:36,060
Whether you did as I ordered... or not.

1413
02:21:37,910 --> 02:21:39,340
We'll soon find out.

1414
02:21:43,780 --> 02:21:46,150
If you betrayed us... you'll die!

1415
02:21:48,260 --> 02:21:53,800
We'll report you as having been shot
helping the men to escape.

1416
02:21:54,470 --> 02:21:55,780
We'll even be rewarded.

1417
02:22:36,100 --> 02:22:36,790
They're coming!

1418
02:23:05,940 --> 02:23:06,810
Mr. Furuya!

1419
02:23:10,170 --> 02:23:11,330
The power... I haven't...

1420
02:23:12,820 --> 02:23:13,540
What?

1421
02:23:28,430 --> 02:23:30,910
Dog! You want to be killed?

1422
02:24:04,670 --> 02:24:08,000
I can't believe that Chen
was behind it all.

1423
02:24:09,080 --> 02:24:10,910
I've been blind!

1424
02:24:12,670 --> 02:24:13,400
Furuya -

1425
02:24:15,620 --> 02:24:20,230
I hadn't believed you capable
of such a diabolic plot!

1426
02:24:21,180 --> 02:24:23,590
Go brag to the boss of your brave deed.

1427
02:24:29,480 --> 02:24:30,270
And you, Wang!

1428
02:24:32,760 --> 02:24:38,260
You're not always right either.
Mistaken leadership caused this.

1429
02:24:38,970 --> 02:24:41,570
You refused to trust us.

1430
02:24:43,090 --> 02:24:48,220
The result is charred human flesh.
It serves you right!

1431
02:24:51,390 --> 02:24:53,560
Lao Kao!

1432
02:25:04,920 --> 02:25:07,540
Why did you do it?

1433
02:25:13,110 --> 02:25:13,750
Kao!

1434
02:25:38,300 --> 02:25:39,120
Chun Lan!

1435
02:25:41,050 --> 02:25:44,000
Gaze upon he who murdered his friends.

1436
02:26:14,020 --> 02:26:16,500
Okishima came and told me about it.

1437
02:26:18,090 --> 02:26:19,790
Why didn't Chen come to me?

1438
02:26:21,250 --> 02:26:23,050
He was afraid... probably.

1439
02:26:24,980 --> 02:26:26,460
Because I struck him?

1440
02:26:29,660 --> 02:26:35,850
Okishima was saying that
you'd brood over this incident.

1441
02:26:38,290 --> 02:26:40,510
It's not my fault that I'm Japanese!

1442
02:26:42,500 --> 02:26:45,350
Yet... my worst crime is that I am!

1443
02:26:53,990 --> 02:26:57,760
Though I struck Chen...
he still liked you.

1444
02:26:59,350 --> 02:27:01,090
And he understood how I felt.

1445
02:27:02,870 --> 02:27:04,490
Yet... look what happened!

1446
02:27:07,120 --> 02:27:09,750
That dog Furuya!

1447
02:27:10,850 --> 02:27:12,870
The boss put him up to this!

1448
02:27:15,110 --> 02:27:17,750
They'll never meddle in
labour affairs again!

1449
02:27:27,630 --> 02:27:32,430
Let's go home! Some nice hot soup

1450
02:27:32,630 --> 02:27:34,330
will help you regain your vitality.

1451
02:27:36,880 --> 02:27:37,790
Let's go.

1452
02:27:40,140 --> 02:27:40,940
Let's go.

1453
02:28:10,460 --> 02:28:13,460
It may not help but I wish
you'd talk to them

1454
02:28:13,470 --> 02:28:17,750
about the treatment of the prisoners.

1455
02:28:19,000 --> 02:28:23,080
I'm asking you though it's
no longer your job.

1456
02:28:23,090 --> 02:28:24,670
Yes, I'll talk to them,

1457
02:28:25,300 --> 02:28:29,320
My trip will cool us both off,
I'll fix it up for you.

1458
02:28:31,890 --> 02:28:34,550
But the boss thinks more of Okazaki.

1459
02:28:38,930 --> 02:28:41,100
I'm boarding this run down truck.

1460
02:28:41,500 --> 02:28:44,760
You prefer the train of humanism...

1461
02:28:45,780 --> 02:28:46,660
I won't stop you.

1462
02:28:47,890 --> 02:28:50,540
You seem willing to pay the price.

1463
02:29:43,610 --> 02:29:46,660
Something I shouldn't know?

1464
02:29:50,490 --> 02:29:53,890
I've already offered my apologies.

1465
02:29:54,920 --> 02:29:56,410
We didn't say anything.

1466
02:30:00,240 --> 02:30:04,930
From now on, we'll have to escape
from the work areas.

1467
02:30:05,530 --> 02:30:08,440
Wang wants us to lie low for a while.

1468
02:30:09,050 --> 02:30:13,790
And we haven't received any news
from the others.

1469
02:30:27,730 --> 02:30:29,340
What's going on here?

1470
02:30:31,910 --> 02:30:32,730
Hide!

1471
02:30:53,300 --> 02:30:54,070
Wait!

1472
02:31:10,590 --> 02:31:14,690
How about it? They're offering us
500 more prisoners.

1473
02:31:16,140 --> 02:31:17,860
We lack the accommodations.

1474
02:31:17,870 --> 02:31:19,510
No accommodation?

1475
02:31:19,520 --> 02:31:21,670
And also supervision?

1476
02:31:23,060 --> 02:31:27,080
Boss! We just caught 7 prisoners
who tried to escape.

1477
02:31:27,090 --> 02:31:27,860
Captured them?

1478
02:31:27,870 --> 02:31:28,400
Yes.

1479
02:31:28,410 --> 02:31:31,270
Good work! You've done well.

1480
02:31:31,280 --> 02:31:33,640
The rascals almost got away.

1481
02:31:33,740 --> 02:31:35,370
From the pit?

1482
02:31:35,380 --> 02:31:36,100
From the ore dump.

1483
02:31:36,340 --> 02:31:37,250
That's not true.

1484
02:31:37,550 --> 02:31:40,900
You weren't there! How could you know?

1485
02:31:41,000 --> 02:31:42,740
Escape? In broad daylight?

1486
02:31:43,310 --> 02:31:47,660
Look at this! Only the desperate
would throw ore at me.

1487
02:31:47,760 --> 02:31:49,440
And so it's a break?

1488
02:31:49,450 --> 02:31:54,330
I'm not the only witness,
It took 15 men to capture them.

1489
02:31:54,340 --> 02:31:57,860
Inside the compound?
You call that a break?

1490
02:31:57,870 --> 02:31:59,670
Why do you defend the Chinks?

1491
02:31:59,970 --> 02:32:02,020
Please excuse me...

1492
02:32:02,030 --> 02:32:03,110
You needn't bother!

1493
02:32:07,640 --> 02:32:08,900
Where are they?

1494
02:32:09,190 --> 02:32:10,750
They're in the guard house.

1495
02:32:12,720 --> 02:32:15,090
Captain... I request instructions!

1496
02:32:16,320 --> 02:32:21,150
Let's see! Shall we do it
the way you suggested?

1497
02:32:26,750 --> 02:32:32,450
He's an expert swordsman.
How many men did you slay in China?

1498
02:32:33,320 --> 02:32:36,190
Please wait! We don't have any proof yet.

1499
02:32:36,590 --> 02:32:40,200
Silence! We have a witness,
Any objections?

1500
02:32:40,540 --> 02:32:43,910
Yes! An impassioned witness
can't be trusted.

1501
02:32:44,510 --> 02:32:49,870
They all want to escape!
Would you have them all executed?

1502
02:32:49,880 --> 02:32:50,600
Why you!

1503
02:32:50,700 --> 02:32:51,600
Enough!

1504
02:32:53,200 --> 02:32:56,710
We needn't debate the matter here.

1505
02:32:56,720 --> 02:33:00,980
The important thing is that
we recognize it as an attempt.

1506
02:33:01,350 --> 02:33:08,090
Sergeant, they will be executed
tomorrow! Details are left to you.

1507
02:33:08,360 --> 02:33:10,490
They will be executed tomorrow, sir!

1508
02:33:15,600 --> 02:33:16,920
Any objections?

1509
02:33:25,000 --> 02:33:28,610
You shall be witness to the execution.

1510
02:34:19,190 --> 02:34:24,540
By just giving testimony,
you'll be saving the lives of men!

1511
02:34:25,950 --> 02:34:28,550
It was an attempt! They ran!

1512
02:34:28,770 --> 02:34:33,450
They should have stayed
and taken their beating.

1513
02:34:40,010 --> 02:34:42,130
What's going to happen to us?

1514
02:34:43,250 --> 02:34:50,060
If injuring Okazaki was a crime,
why not just investigate me?

1515
02:34:52,230 --> 02:34:56,340
Heed me well!
You're all guilty of attempted escape.

1516
02:35:01,480 --> 02:35:02,520
Keep quiet!

1517
02:35:04,960 --> 02:35:06,560
Dog!

1518
02:35:09,960 --> 02:35:13,180
An investigation will bring out the truth.

1519
02:35:14,220 --> 02:35:15,370
Investigate us!

1520
02:35:15,470 --> 02:35:16,960
Investigate us!

1521
02:35:21,660 --> 02:35:24,510
The investigation is over.

1522
02:35:26,000 --> 02:35:32,100
I cannot believe that it was
an attempted escape.

1523
02:35:32,650 --> 02:35:36,400
You're delivering us to the KEMPEITAI?

1524
02:35:37,000 --> 02:35:38,450
I don't intend to.

1525
02:35:40,240 --> 02:35:46,410
You were the one who never trusted me.

1526
02:35:47,640 --> 02:35:53,690
Perhaps it is better to continue
to doubt my words.

1527
02:35:55,070 --> 02:35:58,280
Those men have authority.

1528
02:35:59,230 --> 02:36:02,090
I have no authority.

1529
02:36:06,590 --> 02:36:12,890
I'll do what I can
until tomorrow evening.

1530
02:36:19,390 --> 02:36:22,430
The KEMPEITAI will listen to you!

1531
02:36:22,440 --> 02:36:24,160
It's an object lesson, Kaji.

1532
02:36:25,040 --> 02:36:25,740
It can't be...

1533
02:36:26,660 --> 02:36:29,620
Personally, I don't approve of it.

1534
02:36:30,130 --> 02:36:34,230
But Head Office says...
leave it to the KEMPEITAI.

1535
02:36:34,410 --> 02:36:35,380
Why?

1536
02:36:35,680 --> 02:36:37,360
Must there be a reason?

1537
02:36:38,520 --> 02:36:43,520
Please, wait! Human heads are
about to be chopped off.

1538
02:36:43,720 --> 02:36:46,190
If the company protested...

1539
02:36:48,930 --> 02:36:51,960
Don't forget... we are at war!

1540
02:36:52,640 --> 02:36:54,210
That's no reason!

1541
02:36:55,310 --> 02:37:00,000
You don't think so... but I do!
An idle discussion.

1542
02:37:01,040 --> 02:37:04,260
If you wish, you can talk
to our Head Office.

1543
02:37:06,360 --> 02:37:07,640
I certainly will!

1544
02:37:08,110 --> 02:37:10,100
Hello. Yes.

1545
02:37:11,020 --> 02:37:14,560
Sorry, no answer! He's in conference.

1546
02:37:17,120 --> 02:37:19,000
He shouts and screams like a madman!

1547
02:37:20,880 --> 02:37:23,270
Yes... one moment, please.

1548
02:37:24,040 --> 02:37:25,550
Someone else will take it.

1549
02:37:26,460 --> 02:37:32,210
Okishima? We're in real trouble.
You know about it?

1550
02:37:37,390 --> 02:37:43,880
Hello... I can't hear you!
Speak louder!

1551
02:37:45,390 --> 02:37:46,340
I can't hear you!

1552
02:37:50,100 --> 02:37:50,970
What's that?

1553
02:37:53,130 --> 02:37:54,140
Give up?

1554
02:37:55,130 --> 02:37:56,440
Ridiculous!

1555
02:37:57,050 --> 02:38:00,180
Okishima! Please... talk to them again.

1556
02:38:00,190 --> 02:38:05,430
Yes... yes... please, try again!
I'll be waiting.

1557
02:38:19,930 --> 02:38:24,710
I'll be honest...
Only one chance in a hundred!

1558
02:38:25,230 --> 02:38:32,590
Just as my companions stand
on the borders of life and death,

1559
02:38:32,590 --> 02:38:36,620
so do you now stand at
an important crossroad.

1560
02:38:37,220 --> 02:38:38,350
That's true.

1561
02:38:38,360 --> 02:38:44,200
If you should fail now,
no one will ever trust you again.

1562
02:38:44,580 --> 02:38:47,590
You will also lose faith in yourself.

1563
02:38:48,610 --> 02:38:49,790
Very true!

1564
02:38:50,140 --> 02:38:52,430
Yet... you would do nothing?

1565
02:38:53,080 --> 02:38:54,460
What can I do?

1566
02:38:54,560 --> 02:39:00,310
Must one outside this barbed wire
ask me such a question?

1567
02:39:03,310 --> 02:39:07,970
All Japanese working here are
not murderous devils.

1568
02:39:08,300 --> 02:39:12,740
Their combined opinion objecting
to this execution

1569
02:39:12,750 --> 02:39:16,280
will be more effective than you alone.

1570
02:39:16,780 --> 02:39:20,240
If I always acted as you wanted me to,

1571
02:39:20,800 --> 02:39:23,590
there would be no Kaji here today.

1572
02:39:24,660 --> 02:39:29,910
I wish I could watch you when
you're in my position.

1573
02:39:30,270 --> 02:39:35,150
Minor mistakes... you will make
and so will I.

1574
02:39:35,580 --> 02:39:37,960
Such things can be forgiven.

1575
02:39:38,290 --> 02:39:44,180
But an error made at a crucial
moment is an unforgivable crime.

1576
02:39:44,940 --> 02:39:47,710
Your life has been a series of errors

1577
02:39:47,720 --> 02:39:53,350
stemming from the conflict between
your work and yourself.

1578
02:39:53,790 --> 02:39:56,670
Such errors can possibly be corrected.

1579
02:39:56,940 --> 02:40:00,260
But not so for the crucial decision.

1580
02:40:01,510 --> 02:40:02,300
Then?

1581
02:40:02,610 --> 02:40:08,560
Then will be revealed the murderers
who wear the mask of humanism.

1582
02:40:08,660 --> 02:40:12,960
And the ones worthy of the
beautiful name... "man"

1583
02:40:15,750 --> 02:40:16,710
I realize that.

1584
02:40:18,010 --> 02:40:22,550
You have less faith in men
than you try to believe.

1585
02:40:23,440 --> 02:40:25,210
Regardless of how you might feel,

1586
02:40:25,720 --> 02:40:32,460
true men will always find
fellow companions... somewhere!

1587
02:41:29,970 --> 02:41:32,940
What will happen to my man?

1588
02:41:34,810 --> 02:41:38,740
I only wish I knew myself!

1589
02:41:39,400 --> 02:41:45,510
When will we be released?

1590
02:41:46,520 --> 02:41:51,350
They won't kill Kao, will they?

1591
02:41:52,880 --> 02:41:57,180
Honestly? He won't be killed?

1592
02:42:02,410 --> 02:42:06,030
Hello... Okishima? What's the decision?

1593
02:42:06,130 --> 02:42:09,710
Calm down and listen!
The manager is no help...

1594
02:42:09,810 --> 02:42:10,860
What?

1595
02:42:10,870 --> 02:42:12,990
The old chump!

1596
02:42:12,990 --> 02:42:14,750
Hello? Hello?

1597
02:42:14,760 --> 02:42:18,310
Wait until the morning...
I'll talk to the Chairman.

1598
02:42:18,340 --> 02:42:19,510
What? The Chairman?

1599
02:42:19,520 --> 02:42:23,230
Yes, the Chairman!
I'll make him listen to me.

1600
02:42:44,040 --> 02:42:46,570
Go away... please!

1601
02:42:49,120 --> 02:42:52,210
I want to be alone.

1602
02:42:55,280 --> 02:43:01,370
Mr. Kaji. Save my man... please!

1603
02:43:05,450 --> 02:43:06,860
He wouldn't run away!

1604
02:43:07,720 --> 02:43:16,650
We planned to be married
after the war ended.

1605
02:43:17,400 --> 02:43:19,920
Don't let them kill him!

1606
02:43:20,800 --> 02:43:23,390
Don't let them do it!

1607
02:43:23,940 --> 02:43:25,980
Please... please.

1608
02:43:54,480 --> 02:43:57,580
Go to sleep... you needn't worry!

1609
02:44:01,950 --> 02:44:03,510
I won't do anything.

1610
02:44:05,230 --> 02:44:07,950
There's nothing that I can do.

1611
02:44:14,100 --> 02:44:16,460
Can I really set my mind at ease?

1612
02:44:18,560 --> 02:44:19,330
Really?

1613
02:44:22,770 --> 02:44:26,030
Don't worry. Go to sleep

1614
02:44:32,250 --> 02:44:33,570
I'll try to sleep, too.

1615
02:45:07,490 --> 02:45:08,660
What is it?

1616
02:45:13,370 --> 02:45:14,830
Where are you going?

1617
02:45:15,320 --> 02:45:16,890
I'll free those men!

1618
02:45:17,140 --> 02:45:20,090
Don't do it!
What will happen to you if you do?

1619
02:45:20,130 --> 02:45:21,440
It doesn't matter!

1620
02:45:22,760 --> 02:45:25,090
You've done everything you could.

1621
02:45:25,350 --> 02:45:29,410
Don't you care what happens to you?

1622
02:45:29,510 --> 02:45:30,500
I won't let you!

1623
02:45:30,510 --> 02:45:31,910
Michiko, don't torture me!

1624
02:45:36,040 --> 02:45:40,240
I'll call for help!
I won't let you do it.

1625
02:45:41,130 --> 02:45:44,930
You always go your own way.
Perhaps you are right.

1626
02:45:45,560 --> 02:45:49,060
But if you free those men...
then they'll surely kill you!

1627
02:45:49,160 --> 02:45:50,810
They'll kill you for sure!

1628
02:45:51,960 --> 02:45:53,770
Please... don't go!

1629
02:45:55,390 --> 02:45:58,960
I'll follow you... I'll shout for help!

1630
02:45:59,060 --> 02:46:02,010
Michiko... I'll no longer be a man!

1631
02:46:09,000 --> 02:46:12,920
Are my words those of some stray dog?

1632
02:46:14,270 --> 02:46:18,160
Even you... you don't want to
give up this life... do you?

1633
02:46:19,030 --> 02:46:21,230
Remember... you promised!

1634
02:47:17,290 --> 02:47:22,660
I'm sorry... go and do as you see fit.

1635
02:47:25,380 --> 02:47:27,930
Perhaps I'm the one who's wrong

1636
02:47:28,960 --> 02:47:32,330
I couldn't bear standing in your way.

1637
02:47:32,970 --> 02:47:37,630
I don't want you hating me...
or not loving me.

1638
02:47:39,770 --> 02:47:41,160
I'm just no good!

1639
02:48:24,530 --> 02:48:25,240
All ready!

1640
02:48:25,340 --> 02:48:25,910
Good work.

1641
02:49:01,650 --> 02:49:05,020
It's best to wet the blade.
Keeps off the fat.

1642
02:49:06,760 --> 02:49:07,460
Kaji!

1643
02:49:11,970 --> 02:49:16,370
Stay there! You're acting as my
official witness.

1644
02:50:29,170 --> 02:50:33,450
Kaji... you may tell the men for me

1645
02:50:34,180 --> 02:50:36,400
to attempt escape is to die!

1646
02:50:39,350 --> 02:50:40,430
- Next!
- Yes!

1647
02:51:18,410 --> 02:51:19,670
Want to try?

1648
02:51:20,950 --> 02:51:21,560
Yes!

1649
02:51:23,840 --> 02:51:25,040
- Next!
- Yes!

1650
02:51:32,320 --> 02:51:34,210
No... I don't need it!

1651
02:51:36,430 --> 02:51:40,220
I demand an explanation!

1652
02:51:40,920 --> 02:51:42,400
Why are we being executed?

1653
02:51:42,410 --> 02:51:43,570
Damn you!

1654
02:51:47,160 --> 02:51:48,730
Japanese devils!

1655
02:51:48,920 --> 02:51:50,360
Stand up! Stand up!

1656
02:51:52,240 --> 02:51:53,940
I'll go by myself!

1657
02:52:06,370 --> 02:52:08,060
Inhuman wretch!

1658
02:52:08,840 --> 02:52:12,340
This is your true form!

1659
02:52:18,450 --> 02:52:20,100
The face of a man...

1660
02:52:21,810 --> 02:52:23,400
but the heart of a beast!

1661
02:52:33,180 --> 02:52:35,510
Good! You show grit.

1662
02:53:09,020 --> 02:53:10,650
Stay calm! Slash him!

1663
02:53:12,250 --> 02:53:17,150
Hurrah for China!

1664
02:53:39,560 --> 02:53:41,940
You fail because you think it's

1665
02:53:42,570 --> 02:53:45,320
a human head. Relax and try again.

1666
02:53:47,220 --> 02:53:48,140
Next!

1667
02:53:56,900 --> 02:53:57,630
No more!

1668
02:54:00,080 --> 02:54:01,160
That'll be enough!

1669
02:54:01,960 --> 02:54:02,740
What?

1670
02:54:03,440 --> 02:54:04,700
That'll be enough!

1671
02:54:05,220 --> 02:54:08,450
Stay out of this or I'll kill you too!

1672
02:54:08,830 --> 02:54:12,730
I'm no longer afraid.
Slay me if you dare.

1673
02:54:13,250 --> 02:54:14,870
Good... I'll oblige.

1674
02:54:15,860 --> 02:54:18,950
Enemy sympathizers are better off dead.

1675
02:54:35,260 --> 02:54:37,710
Stop this massacre of our comrades!

1676
02:54:38,110 --> 02:54:42,380
Murderers! Murderer! Killers!

1677
02:54:50,070 --> 02:54:58,840
Murderer! Murderer! Murderer!

1678
02:55:31,250 --> 02:55:36,160
Murderer! Murderer! Murderer!

1679
02:56:35,940 --> 02:56:37,280
The execution is called off!

1680
02:56:55,080 --> 02:56:57,780
Go... go back to them!

1681
02:58:04,800 --> 02:58:06,500
You're coming with me.

1682
02:58:40,730 --> 02:58:45,930
Private Tenaka... take very good
care of our honoured guest.

1683
02:58:47,730 --> 02:58:49,490
I'll return later. Go!

1684
03:00:00,010 --> 03:00:01,650
Kaji won't be home today.

1685
03:00:23,490 --> 03:00:26,490
Did... did he do something?

1686
03:00:27,110 --> 03:00:32,450
Do something? He refused to let us
execute those enemy dogs!

1687
03:00:32,890 --> 03:00:36,080
He may be away some time...it depends!

1688
03:00:41,440 --> 03:00:43,020
Did he hide anything?

1689
03:00:43,520 --> 03:00:44,840
No!

1690
03:00:48,630 --> 03:00:51,720
It's because his way of thinking is no good.

1691
03:00:53,610 --> 03:00:55,040
Open the desk drawers.

1692
03:01:07,060 --> 03:01:09,640
Place everything on top of the desk.

1693
03:02:12,090 --> 03:02:16,880
Well... you feel like confessing now!

1694
03:02:20,450 --> 03:02:25,390
I only regret that I let you
behead the first three victims.

1695
03:02:26,750 --> 03:02:27,850
You don't say!

1696
03:02:33,940 --> 03:02:35,470
You're a hopeless one.

1697
03:02:55,990 --> 03:03:01,870
Private Tanaka... you should show
our guest more courtesy.

1698
03:03:05,170 --> 03:03:07,970
Kaji... don't you miss your wife?

1699
03:03:10,800 --> 03:03:15,120
She was crying. No one to ride
her belly from tonight.

1700
03:03:15,500 --> 03:03:17,040
What have I done?

1701
03:03:19,120 --> 03:03:24,980
I'm no boor... I'd like to put you
back on your wife's belly

1702
03:03:25,640 --> 03:03:30,720
but in order to do so, I must have
more cooperation from you.

1703
03:03:34,290 --> 03:03:34,990
What's so funny?

1704
03:03:35,820 --> 03:03:41,010
I neither pick pockets nor steal.
What shall I confess?

1705
03:03:41,020 --> 03:03:45,840
Interesting! You needn't confess to
anything until we make you.

1706
03:03:49,300 --> 03:03:51,180
Your bravado won't last long.

1707
03:03:53,470 --> 03:03:56,900
You let 11 POWs escape and
failed to report it.

1708
03:04:00,020 --> 03:04:01,530
I'm waiting for an answer.

1709
03:04:02,860 --> 03:04:06,550
I didn't report it...
but I never let them escape!

1710
03:04:07,820 --> 03:04:11,740
You used Chen to contact the prisoners!

1711
03:04:11,940 --> 03:04:16,900
Show me evidence! Will you lose face
if I'm not found guilty?

1712
03:04:39,710 --> 03:04:41,240
You wanted something?

1713
03:04:43,360 --> 03:04:46,560
I didn't mean it to end up like this.

1714
03:04:47,520 --> 03:04:54,460
Quarrels over work are one thing
but I don't need outside help for that.

1715
03:04:55,350 --> 03:04:56,460
I came to...

1716
03:04:56,470 --> 03:04:57,630
I understand.

1717
03:04:58,810 --> 03:05:01,490
But I didn't think Kaji would dare...

1718
03:05:04,230 --> 03:05:06,230
Kaji would dare do what...?

1719
03:05:06,830 --> 03:05:08,650
Oh... nothing!

1720
03:05:09,060 --> 03:05:11,710
I don't know how the others feel...

1721
03:05:12,240 --> 03:05:15,780
But I feel that what he did...
only he could do.

1722
03:05:17,040 --> 03:05:21,440
If that's how you feel,
you can do as you please.

1723
03:05:21,940 --> 03:05:26,560
I dropped by to see if I could
help you in any way.

1724
03:05:26,660 --> 03:05:29,020
Your help will not be needed.

1725
03:05:29,500 --> 03:05:34,960
What you can do is to admit that
it was not an attempted escape.

1726
03:05:36,700 --> 03:05:42,220
Admit it! You and Wang Heng Li
helped them escape... didn't you?

1727
03:05:47,160 --> 03:05:49,370
Answer me... you scum!

1728
03:05:51,280 --> 03:05:56,160
Wang Heng Li was arrested and
has confessed everything.

1729
03:05:58,210 --> 03:05:59,820
Wang was arrested?

1730
03:06:02,030 --> 03:06:03,700
He now awaits execution.

1731
03:06:06,860 --> 03:06:08,210
When will it be?

1732
03:06:09,250 --> 03:06:13,960
It worries you? After all...
he was your friend!

1733
03:06:15,340 --> 03:06:20,380
Wang instigated the uprising at
your request... am I right?

1734
03:06:20,580 --> 03:06:22,300
When will he die?

1735
03:06:22,580 --> 03:06:23,850
Answer my question!

1736
03:06:26,380 --> 03:06:30,820
All right! Today I'll make you
weep like a women.

1737
03:06:31,690 --> 03:06:33,540
I hope your wife hears you.

1738
03:06:49,380 --> 03:06:52,650
<i>WANG HENG LI
In Memorium</i>

1739
03:07:01,130 --> 03:07:07,570
Wang... you have died without
awaiting the dawn.

1740
03:07:12,170 --> 03:07:21,200
But your comrades will surely bury you
by the light of the newborn day.

1741
03:07:44,020 --> 03:07:47,440
Come... out here!

1742
03:08:12,670 --> 03:08:13,530
Go inside!

1743
03:08:47,750 --> 03:08:51,090
Kiss her... don't let me stop you.

1744
03:08:54,030 --> 03:08:58,720
Michiko! Why did you come?
Don't worry... go home!

1745
03:08:58,820 --> 03:09:04,970
I brought some rice balls...
may I offer them to him?

1746
03:09:39,430 --> 03:09:40,870
Won't you have some?

1747
03:10:15,710 --> 03:10:22,600
Michiko... when you need help,
talk it over with Okishima.

1748
03:10:23,620 --> 03:10:25,780
Okishima... look after her.

1749
03:10:28,400 --> 03:10:33,190
Mr. Okishima... he's being transferred.

1750
03:10:37,860 --> 03:10:39,240
I came to say goodbye.

1751
03:10:39,540 --> 03:10:41,170
I see.

1752
03:10:42,890 --> 03:10:45,170
I'm sorry I wasn't able to help.

1753
03:10:47,500 --> 03:10:51,800
I had a row with the manager
and I'm being ousted.

1754
03:10:54,350 --> 03:10:55,350
I see.

1755
03:10:58,240 --> 03:11:02,130
I wanted to stay and argue
some more with you.

1756
03:11:07,290 --> 03:11:09,570
Furuya takes over my spot.

1757
03:11:12,470 --> 03:11:14,000
That'll be the end.

1758
03:11:20,160 --> 03:11:22,240
Is there anything you need?

1759
03:11:24,500 --> 03:11:25,930
Nothing.

1760
03:11:29,850 --> 03:11:32,980
That means... I won't see you anymore?

1761
03:11:35,800 --> 03:11:39,160
I learned so much from you.

1762
03:11:41,470 --> 03:11:44,300
No... that's for me to say.

1763
03:11:45,430 --> 03:11:53,410
Though you have paid a bitter price,
you finally caught the humanism train.

1764
03:12:00,450 --> 03:12:02,460
Oh, yes... Wang Heng Li...

1765
03:12:03,060 --> 03:12:04,990
Unnecessary conversation is
not permitted!

1766
03:12:06,310 --> 03:12:08,580
Your time is up.

1767
03:12:09,350 --> 03:12:10,300
Private Tenaka!

1768
03:12:19,870 --> 03:12:20,770
Michiko!

1769
03:12:43,510 --> 03:12:46,000
As a special favour, I'm releasing you.

1770
03:12:51,030 --> 03:12:53,230
But I'm not setting you free.

1771
03:12:54,230 --> 03:12:58,190
Remember... my eyes will follow
your every move.

1772
03:12:58,860 --> 03:13:02,460
Go where you may...
I'll always be there first.

1773
03:13:53,850 --> 03:13:55,030
I report back, sir.

1774
03:13:56,940 --> 03:13:58,390
It has come... Kaji.

1775
03:14:12,880 --> 03:14:16,750
<i>Emergency Call to Military Service.</i>

1776
03:14:28,330 --> 03:14:29,720
I suspected as much!

1777
03:14:31,230 --> 03:14:34,510
So you wring me dry and cast me out.

1778
03:14:36,840 --> 03:14:42,850
I can't afford to lose you
but there's nothing I can do.

1779
03:14:44,550 --> 03:14:46,050
Forget the smooth talk!

1780
03:14:47,920 --> 03:14:52,130
It's the easy way to rid yourself
of the unwanted.

1781
03:14:52,230 --> 03:14:58,750
Far better to have trusted the harlots
than the directors of this company.

1782
03:15:01,430 --> 03:15:08,060
Kaji... Turn your duties over to Furuya.

1783
03:15:09,170 --> 03:15:12,540
We need a new leader for the prisoners.

1784
03:15:13,220 --> 03:15:16,740
Good men are scarce since
Wang Heng Li escaped.

1785
03:15:18,630 --> 03:15:22,580
Escaped? Wang Heng Li?

1786
03:15:24,320 --> 03:15:26,160
Along with 30 others.

1787
03:15:35,630 --> 03:15:39,860
So he got away! Good for you, Wang!

1788
03:15:43,160 --> 03:15:46,210
Wonderful! I hope they all get away.

1789
03:15:50,950 --> 03:15:54,100
Sir... I wish you'd inform Furuya...

1790
03:15:55,040 --> 03:15:59,380
That Wang's escape saved him
from a thorough beating.

1791
03:16:00,130 --> 03:16:04,960
I was going in there to thrash him...
not to hand over my work!

1792
03:16:07,440 --> 03:16:11,330
But suddenly... I've changed my mind!

1793
03:16:12,520 --> 03:16:16,800
Probably because I found that
I was in good company.

1794
03:16:20,350 --> 03:16:21,620
Japanese devil!

1795
03:16:24,340 --> 03:16:25,750
Japanese devil!

1796
03:16:26,990 --> 03:16:31,650
Kill me... like you murdered Kao!
Kill me!

1797
03:16:32,590 --> 03:16:37,060
Why don't you kill me? Japanese devil!

1798
03:16:39,360 --> 03:16:42,860
He murdered an innocent man!

1799
03:16:43,440 --> 03:16:44,710
Murderer!

1800
03:16:44,780 --> 03:16:46,120
Murderer!

1801
03:16:47,170 --> 03:16:48,100
Mr. Kaji.

1802
03:16:51,010 --> 03:16:52,910
Be not angry.

1803
03:16:54,110 --> 03:16:57,810
I know you have a good heart.

1804
03:16:59,600 --> 03:17:05,910
But you're not able to save Kao's life.
That's why...

1805
03:17:43,450 --> 03:17:44,650
You'll stumble, Michiko!

1806
03:17:57,760 --> 03:17:58,790
Welcome home!

1807
03:18:01,090 --> 03:18:02,450
Thank goodness!

1808
03:18:04,080 --> 03:18:07,870
One of the wives told me you had
come back in terrible shape.

1809
03:18:09,030 --> 03:18:12,090
But it's not true! You're looking fine.

1810
03:18:12,100 --> 03:18:16,070
Thank goodness, really, thank goodness!

1811
03:18:19,050 --> 03:18:20,450
This... what is it?

1812
03:18:22,250 --> 03:18:23,380
But they couldn't.

1813
03:18:25,560 --> 03:18:27,600
No... it's not fair!

1814
03:18:29,290 --> 03:18:33,080
They promised you military exemption.
A dirty trick!

1815
03:18:36,120 --> 03:18:40,530
This is too much... it's unfair!

1816
03:18:42,850 --> 03:18:49,270
Michiko... there's nothing that
can be done now.

1817
03:18:51,440 --> 03:18:53,670
Why must they do this to you?

1818
03:18:55,370 --> 03:18:56,810
I've done nothing.

1819
03:18:59,430 --> 03:19:04,220
But I had hoped to accomplish things
with you when I returned.

1820
03:19:12,130 --> 03:19:15,460
Why must you always be persecuted so?

1821
03:19:19,600 --> 03:19:21,390
Why do they pick on you?

1822
03:19:23,520 --> 03:19:27,680
You're so thin... and so full of scars.

1823
03:19:31,180 --> 03:19:34,270
And now they send you to the front.

1824
03:19:35,120 --> 03:19:35,890
Michiko!

1825
03:19:42,040 --> 03:19:47,230
You mustn't die... we must live again!

1826
03:19:48,300 --> 03:19:51,790
When will we be able to meet again?

1827
03:19:56,320 --> 03:20:00,560
You'll come back... I know you will.

1828
03:20:00,930 --> 03:20:02,900
Japanese devil!

1829
03:20:05,250 --> 03:20:07,220
Japanese devil!

1830
03:20:08,810 --> 03:20:10,580
Japanese devil!

1831
03:20:10,780 --> 03:20:12,410
You die!

1832
03:20:16,570 --> 03:20:20,910
Michiko, let's go! We still have
24 hours together.

1833
03:20:22,700 --> 03:20:25,070
Japanese devil!
