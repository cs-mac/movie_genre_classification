1
00:00:11,271 --> 00:00:13,609
<i>Nina was only away for 3 years.</i>

2
00:00:13,609 --> 00:00:16,753
Nina, you're looking well.
London must agree with you.

3
00:00:16,753 --> 00:00:20,152
- The prody girl returns.
- It's been a long time, girlfriend.

4
00:00:20,152 --> 00:00:22,500
<i>But in that time everything has changed.</i>

5
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,910
Dad used the restaurant as
collateral for a bet?

6
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:26,670
In his defence he was up to his eyes.

7
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:28,648
- He knew what he was doing.
- He was desperate.

8
00:00:28,648 --> 00:00:30,498
"The Taj" meant everything to my dad.

9
00:00:30,498 --> 00:00:33,421
<i>Now, Nina's cooking up a plan to
save the restaurant.</i>

10
00:00:33,421 --> 00:00:36,144
Got the competition coming up.
Sanjay's in the final.

11
00:00:36,144 --> 00:00:38,661
<i>And all she needs,
is a little competition.</i>

12
00:00:38,661 --> 00:00:40,908
He wanted to win that trophy
for the third time.

13
00:00:40,908 --> 00:00:43,440
Just imagine "The Taj"...
competing again.

14
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,998
Just imagine?

15
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:47,819
- Who are we up against?
- OK: The "Bengal Tiger".

16
00:00:47,819 --> 00:00:48,820
Pussycat...

17
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:51,303
- Unless it's under new management.
- It is.

18
00:00:52,758 --> 00:00:54,291
Last year's winners.

19
00:00:55,011 --> 00:00:57,509
And then last, "The Jewel in the Crown".

20
00:00:57,509 --> 00:00:59,819
- It's in the bag.
- Oh yeah, it's in the bag.

21
00:00:59,819 --> 00:01:01,155
Let's eat.

22
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:05,989
<i>Now, Nina's cooking up a storm...</i>

23
00:01:05,989 --> 00:01:08,660
How dare you come back here and
start disrupting our lives?

24
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:10,426
...spicing up the competition...

25
00:01:10,637 --> 00:01:12,316
- It's delicious.
- It's terrible.

26
00:01:12,316 --> 00:01:13,477
<i>...and stirring up trouble.</i>

27
00:01:13,883 --> 00:01:15,211
Sanjay's a black belt curry master.

28
00:01:15,221 --> 00:01:17,313
So what? Nina is a curry ninja.

29
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:19,878
<i>Get ready for a romantic feast</i>

30
00:01:19,878 --> 00:01:23,920
<i>rich with the taste of life,
love and spices.</i>

31
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,360
- Well?
- It's better.

32
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,852
I hope you're firing on all
cylinders tonight, Sanjay.

33
00:01:29,553 --> 00:01:31,335
<i>Always follow your heart.</i>

34
00:01:31,877 --> 00:01:32,555
That's lovely.

35
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:33,929
It's now or never, Nina.

36
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:38,718
- Catchy title.
- Aye! And we're gonna blow them away.

37
00:02:03,303 --> 00:02:06,809
Always measure the spices first, pettit.

38
00:02:06,809 --> 00:02:09,533
Six cloves.

39
00:02:09,533 --> 00:02:13,531
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

40
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:18,390
Eight chillies.

41
00:02:36,634 --> 00:02:40,690
Half a tea spoon of turmeric.

42
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,650
Keep it stirring.

43
00:03:12,315 --> 00:03:13,615
Keep it moving.

44
00:03:14,293 --> 00:03:16,991
Cover every inch with the sauce.

45
00:03:26,518 --> 00:03:28,703
There's no need to rush, Nina pettit.

46
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:31,160
Always take your time.

47
00:03:32,219 --> 00:03:34,893
That's the difference between
winning and losing.

48
00:03:39,633 --> 00:03:41,789
Now, close your eyes.

49
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:50,809
Taste it. Taste it in your heart.

50
00:03:51,462 --> 00:03:55,953
No matter what the recipe says, pettit,
always follow your heart.

51
00:04:00,494 --> 00:04:03,516
Best chicken xacuti this
side of Maryhill.

52
00:04:05,371 --> 00:04:09,101
One day, pettit, you're going to be
the best cook in Glasgow.

53
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:30,518
Nina Bina
(hindi: dear).

54
00:04:34,723 --> 00:04:36,512
You look awful.

55
00:04:37,214 --> 00:04:38,914
So do you.

56
00:04:40,101 --> 00:04:42,929
It's been a long time, girlfriend.

57
00:04:44,299 --> 00:04:46,336
I'm so sorry, darling.

58
00:04:58,051 --> 00:05:01,889
We are here today to say goodbye
to a very special man.

59
00:05:02,975 --> 00:05:08,390
Mohan Shah was a devoted husband
and a loving father to all of his children.

60
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:11,257
Especially his Nina.

61
00:05:11,835 --> 00:05:15,834
Out of sight, but never out
of her father's heart.

62
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,647
Many times Mohan said to me:

63
00:05:21,072 --> 00:05:25,248
"Nina will come home, Raj.
She'll come home soon.

64
00:05:26,008 --> 00:05:29,748
Then I'll be in Heaven."

65
00:06:52,543 --> 00:06:53,821
Nina?

66
00:06:55,255 --> 00:06:57,171
I knew you'd come.

67
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:59,333
Kary...

68
00:07:20,216 --> 00:07:21,457
Ma'...

69
00:07:25,852 --> 00:07:27,603
He's gone, Nina.

70
00:07:29,356 --> 00:07:31,337
Your dad's gone.

71
00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:45,040
- She's far too thin.
- Oh, she's home now and her mummy

72
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:48,175
will fatten her up.
- Do you think she's...

73
00:07:48,175 --> 00:07:50,030
- got a man?
- I doubt that.

74
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:51,989
You know what? With one thing and another,

75
00:07:51,989 --> 00:07:54,460
things may be different between the two of you, Sanjay.

76
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:57,169
- You know what they say...
- Forgive and forget.

77
00:07:57,169 --> 00:07:59,480
They say a wedding's lucky, the first
year after, that is.

78
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:02,262
- Oh yes.
- We ran out of samosas.

79
00:08:04,023 --> 00:08:06,051
Aha, the prody girl returns.

80
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:09,618
Hello, Sanjay.

81
00:08:11,261 --> 00:08:13,218
Your mother asked me to help out.

82
00:08:13,441 --> 00:08:15,740
I'm really sorry about your dad, Nina.

83
00:08:16,106 --> 00:08:18,471
Right, samosas... I'm on it.

84
00:08:23,949 --> 00:08:26,449
- Who's that?
- Ah, it's Lisa.

85
00:08:27,094 --> 00:08:31,578
- Maybe you should have a wee word
with your brother. - 3 years is a long time.

86
00:08:32,076 --> 00:08:34,085
You're gonna have a lot to talk about.

87
00:08:53,203 --> 00:08:54,965
It's dead hot in there.

88
00:08:54,965 --> 00:08:56,958
- Here, let me do it.
- It's OK, I can...

89
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:06,500
How's London?
Still frying burgers?

90
00:09:10,181 --> 00:09:14,281
- I'm sorry I was late.
- It's no scan of minors.

91
00:09:14,281 --> 00:09:18,507
You don't have to explain it to me and
it's too late to explain it to him.

92
00:09:22,682 --> 00:09:24,274
How's med school?

93
00:09:25,071 --> 00:09:26,532
I've checked that in. (?)

94
00:09:27,014 --> 00:09:29,768
I'm working for Raj now and
I pure love it.

95
00:09:30,248 --> 00:09:34,945
It's only a means to an end. I'll have my own
cash and carry superstore before I'm 30.

96
00:09:36,135 --> 00:09:37,833
- Kary, darling, come in a minute.

97
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:40,190
I wanna set myself up with my share
of the rest of the restaurant money.

98
00:09:42,912 --> 00:09:44,443
What restaurant money?

99
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:49,046
Mrs Bandita's gout's been giving up gyp.
I said you'd have a wee look at it.

100
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:52,495
- Her own doctor's worse than useless.
- You know I'm not a doctor.

101
00:09:52,495 --> 00:09:56,208
Yes, but you've read all the books. That's
better than most of them around here.

102
00:09:57,222 --> 00:09:59,738
Alright, ladies?
Who's first?

103
00:10:07,359 --> 00:10:09,736
- How you're doing?
- OK.

104
00:10:14,727 --> 00:10:15,773
Lisa.

105
00:10:16,661 --> 00:10:20,850
I'm sorry if I was a bit weird before.
I didn't really recognise you.

106
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:24,567
Why would you! I left in second year.
I hope I've changed since then.

107
00:10:25,571 --> 00:10:27,346
Thanks for helping out today.

108
00:10:28,155 --> 00:10:29,435
No problem.

109
00:10:33,463 --> 00:10:35,239
I remembered you, though.

110
00:10:51,135 --> 00:10:53,543
- Say "Chapati".
- Chapati.

111
00:11:09,286 --> 00:11:11,124
Dear Mr. Mohan Shah,

112
00:11:11,124 --> 00:11:15,796
We are delighted to inform you that
"The New Taj" has been selected...

113
00:11:17,324 --> 00:11:20,648
<i>One more win, Nina,
then we'll have it.</i>

114
00:11:20,648 --> 00:11:22,868
<i>The bloody hattrick!</i>

115
00:11:22,868 --> 00:11:25,994
<i>No other Scottish curry house
has ever done it.</i>

116
00:11:26,305 --> 00:11:29,363
<i>Best bloody restaurant
this side of Maryhill.</i>

117
00:11:39,838 --> 00:11:41,649
- Is she alright?
- Yeah.

118
00:11:41,649 --> 00:11:44,675
What did you mean before?
About the money? What money?

119
00:11:44,675 --> 00:11:47,850
- The money we get from the sale.
- What sale?

120
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:51,248
- "The Taj".
- Kary, hurry up. We're gonna be late...

121
00:11:51,356 --> 00:11:55,452
- Janice will be... Sorry.
Kary, come on. We gotta go,

122
00:11:55,452 --> 00:11:58,665
-  Sorry. We're off.
- No Kary, no.

123
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:05,174
Let me get this straight, dad used the
restaurant as collateral for the bet?

124
00:12:05,174 --> 00:12:07,848
- Not exactly.
- He used half of it.

125
00:12:07,848 --> 00:12:10,650
Oh, well, that's alright then.
Had me worried for a minute.

126
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:12,410
Was he out of his mind?

127
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:15,130
I must say I agree.
It looks like that, pure lunatic.

128
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:18,600
But, in his defence, he was up
to his eyes, he owed thousands.

129
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,525
I guess he thought he had
nothing to lose.

130
00:12:20,525 --> 00:12:22,915
- Is it legal?
- Word: Aye. (?)

131
00:12:22,915 --> 00:12:25,394
Her dad's got a pure Rottweiler
of a lawyer.

132
00:12:25,798 --> 00:12:28,770
Well, then we'll get out own Rottweiler.
This can't be right.

133
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:30,229
A bet's a bet, Nina.

134
00:12:30,229 --> 00:12:32,502
- He knew what he was doing.
- He was desperate.

135
00:12:32,502 --> 00:12:34,474
Your dad took advantage.

136
00:12:35,628 --> 00:12:37,467
Nobody forced him...

137
00:12:38,396 --> 00:12:41,325
- I need to talk to Jule.
- Well, he's in Benidorm.

138
00:12:41,325 --> 00:12:43,800
Golfing, and probably shaging.

139
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,361
Anyway, it's not my dad you
need to talk to.

140
00:12:46,361 --> 00:12:50,209
It's me.
- I've got to take this. Come on.

141
00:12:50,209 --> 00:12:52,807
- No, Kary...
- We're dead late.

142
00:13:00,445 --> 00:13:02,903
<i>Good morning, Glasgow.</i>

143
00:13:03,112 --> 00:13:06,253
<i>It's "Drive Time with Murli" on "Korma Radio".</i>

144
00:13:06,531 --> 00:13:10,500
<i>This afternoon promises to be
bright, promises, promises.</i>

145
00:13:11,191 --> 00:13:13,700
<i>That's good news for poor
miss Khan from Maryhill,</i>

146
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:15,729
<i>who's cat's been missing for a week.</i>

147
00:13:17,431 --> 00:13:19,519
<i>Flights coming in from Mumbai
have been delayed.</i>

148
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:21,619
<i>So don't bother going to the airport.</i>

149
00:13:21,619 --> 00:13:25,064
<i>But we hope that won't delay the
arrival of India's Nº 1...</i>

150
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:35,474
Three, four and step.
Two, three, four.

151
00:13:35,474 --> 00:13:38,569
And change,
and change.

152
00:14:02,671 --> 00:14:03,849
Stop!

153
00:14:04,056 --> 00:14:06,874
No, no, no!

154
00:14:07,466 --> 00:14:10,983
Gandhi, you're moving like
a 5 o'clock princess.

155
00:14:11,194 --> 00:14:16,557
Fish, think West End Wendy,
not muscle Bloody Mary.

156
00:14:20,922 --> 00:14:23,632
I hope you're not spying for
the opposition?

157
00:14:26,832 --> 00:14:30,697
Nina Bina, meet my
"Chutney Queens".

158
00:14:31,636 --> 00:14:34,559
Thank you all.
That's the torture over.

159
00:14:36,215 --> 00:14:37,567
See you later then.

160
00:14:39,029 --> 00:14:43,511
- Maybe, maybe not.
- 8 p.m., the usual place.

161
00:14:44,936 --> 00:14:47,990
Come on, Shriv.
Duty calles. (?)

162
00:14:49,479 --> 00:14:53,223
- You're a dark horse.
- That's rich coming from Black Beauty.

163
00:14:53,624 --> 00:14:54,911
So?

164
00:14:55,403 --> 00:14:59,709
- What do you think? Seriously?
- No, you've got something, definitely.

165
00:15:00,379 --> 00:15:02,184
Just as well.

166
00:15:02,184 --> 00:15:05,746
Because very soon,
"Mogul Productions",

167
00:15:05,746 --> 00:15:10,330
that's "Mogul Productions Mumbai",
not "Mogul Productions Maryhill",

168
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:14,250
will breeze into town to cast their
new Bollywood blockbuster

169
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:16,030
"Love in a Wet Climate".

170
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:19,690
- Catchy title.
- Aye! And we're gonna blow them away.

171
00:15:21,201 --> 00:15:25,803
Me, me, me... That's enough
about me. What about...

172
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:27,495
Me?

173
00:15:27,495 --> 00:15:29,336
Where do I start?

174
00:15:30,472 --> 00:15:34,171
Do pros and cons. That always sorts
the men from the boys.

175
00:15:34,713 --> 00:15:38,555
Well, I would, if there were any
pros to do.

176
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:46,746
God, how did this happen, Bobbi?

177
00:15:47,305 --> 00:15:51,005
- "The Taj" meant everything to my dad.
- Not just your dad.

178
00:16:07,014 --> 00:16:09,109
He'd entered the competition.

179
00:16:09,602 --> 00:16:11,252
Nobody knew.

180
00:16:13,103 --> 00:16:15,919
- He's through to the final.
- Great! (?)

181
00:16:17,073 --> 00:16:19,725
Now we can do pros and cons.

182
00:16:19,993 --> 00:16:21,895
He didn't want to sell, did he?

183
00:16:22,322 --> 00:16:25,148
He wanted to win that trophy
for the third time.

184
00:16:26,055 --> 00:16:30,317
Just imagine "The Taj"...
competing again.

185
00:16:31,872 --> 00:16:35,236
Just imagine?

186
00:16:38,235 --> 00:16:39,619
Come on...

187
00:16:42,171 --> 00:16:45,100
<i>Congratulation to
Mr. & Mrs. Patil,</i>

188
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:48,709
<i>who are celebrating their 25th
wedding aniversary.</i>

189
00:16:49,283 --> 00:16:54,160
<i>But first, a reminder of the big event
coming up next monthon "Korma TV".</i>

190
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:58,013
<i>"The Best of the West" curry competition.</i>

191
00:16:58,344 --> 00:17:00,886
<i>Hold me back!</i>

192
00:17:03,892 --> 00:17:06,455
You're my first today.

193
00:17:06,917 --> 00:17:08,657
I'm honoured.

194
00:17:12,772 --> 00:17:16,100
- Raj.
- Nina, you're looking well.

195
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:18,045
London must agree with you.

196
00:17:19,221 --> 00:17:23,788
Well, if you'll excuse me, I'd better be off,
I got a million and one things to do.

197
00:17:24,055 --> 00:17:27,925
Got the competition coming up.
Sanjay's in the final.

198
00:17:28,239 --> 00:17:30,348
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

199
00:17:30,348 --> 00:17:34,300
- He must be with a very good chance.
- Well, that depends who he's up against.

200
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:36,849
But believe you me, he'll be
a hard act to follow.

201
00:17:37,066 --> 00:17:39,890
Now, if you need anything,
and I mean anything,

202
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:42,457
you let Kary know. Let me know.

203
00:17:42,457 --> 00:17:44,542
- Thank you, Raj.
- Nina...

204
00:17:52,777 --> 00:17:54,867
How long have you been working here?

205
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:58,455
Long enough. You can't live
off thin air.

206
00:17:58,704 --> 00:18:01,550
Your dad left a groove in the
pavement outside "Jule's".

207
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:04,199
Why didn't anyone tell me
what was going on?

208
00:18:04,199 --> 00:18:08,375
How were we supposed to do that? You phoned
a couple of times a year if we were lucky.

209
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:10,295
Half the time we didn't even
know where you were.

210
00:18:10,295 --> 00:18:14,259
Thank God for Raj.
- Yeah. He didn't waste a minute, did he?

211
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:16,910
Beggars can't be choosers.
It's more than it's worth.

212
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:19,920
I don't care. I'm not selling
"The Taj" to them.

213
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:22,614
Well, then it's a good thing it's not
just up to you.

214
00:18:22,614 --> 00:18:25,963
I don't believe this!
This is all dad's fault.

215
00:18:25,963 --> 00:18:29,171
Don't you dare come back here and
start handing out blame!

216
00:18:29,171 --> 00:18:33,066
Don't you dare! If there's blame to be
handed out you should be looking in a mirror.

217
00:18:33,066 --> 00:18:35,925
I'm not the one who bet "The Taj"
on a bloody horse!

218
00:18:35,925 --> 00:18:39,409
No, you're right. You didn't.
You had nothing to do with any of this.

219
00:18:39,677 --> 00:18:42,864
You didn't humiliate him.
You didn't break his heart.

220
00:18:43,965 --> 00:18:46,388
And what about my heart?

221
00:18:48,682 --> 00:18:51,540
He only ever wanted what
was best for you, Nina.

222
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:53,954
We both did.
- No.

223
00:18:54,561 --> 00:18:57,844
You wanted me to shrivel away
with a man I didn't love.

224
00:18:58,672 --> 00:19:00,810
How could I do that, ma'?

225
00:19:02,168 --> 00:19:04,850
We all do things we don't want.

226
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:08,051
- Why?
- There is no "why".

227
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:16,374
Do what you want, Nina.
You always do.

228
00:19:32,461 --> 00:19:33,890
What are you doing?

229
00:19:34,912 --> 00:19:37,055
What I was supposed to do.

230
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:41,638
He was the one who always
said "listen to your heart".

231
00:19:42,279 --> 00:19:46,033
He should've listened to his bloody heart,
then it might not have packed up on him.

232
00:19:47,858 --> 00:19:49,337
How could he?

233
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:52,354
We were gonna do this together.

234
00:19:52,819 --> 00:19:56,074
We were gonna win the
hattrick together.

235
00:19:57,324 --> 00:19:59,753
How could he go and just...

236
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:01,808
...die?

237
00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:44,774
I thought you were Kary.

238
00:20:45,628 --> 00:20:49,087
- Sorry to disappoint.
- Who said you did?

239
00:20:50,394 --> 00:20:52,371
Fancy a beer?

240
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:00,611
Jinks!

241
00:21:02,144 --> 00:21:05,415
Just as well, your dad wasn't here
to see that. That table is a temple.

242
00:21:05,415 --> 00:21:07,742
"Not a bloody bottle-opener!"

243
00:21:08,157 --> 00:21:09,710
To Mohan Shah.

244
00:21:10,063 --> 00:21:13,303
"The best bloody cook
this side of Maryhill."

245
00:21:16,055 --> 00:21:17,439
To Mohan Shah.

246
00:21:24,271 --> 00:21:27,794
- God, this is weird.
- You just lost your dad.

247
00:21:28,376 --> 00:21:31,668
You're about to lose your restaurant.
You're gonna feel a bit weird.

248
00:21:33,493 --> 00:21:35,988
I haven't lost my restaurant just yet.

249
00:21:37,842 --> 00:21:41,498
What if, I could persuade my
new business partner

250
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:46,607
not to jump into bed with the first dodgy
geezer that offers her a knock-down price?

251
00:21:49,997 --> 00:21:51,329
What's wrong?

252
00:21:52,184 --> 00:21:53,908
Well... No.

253
00:21:54,612 --> 00:21:57,315
You can't ask me to do that.
It wouldn't be right.

254
00:21:58,025 --> 00:22:00,241
Your mum's been really good to me,

255
00:22:00,241 --> 00:22:02,326
- and Kary's my...
- Yeah, I know.

256
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:06,403
Look, it's not personal.

257
00:22:06,403 --> 00:22:08,170
It's business.

258
00:22:08,741 --> 00:22:13,211
Doesn't make sense to rush into anything.
We could get a much better price.

259
00:22:13,211 --> 00:22:14,987
We won't.

260
00:22:27,153 --> 00:22:29,369
My dad didn't want to sell.

261
00:22:29,881 --> 00:22:32,295
He wanted to win that competition.

262
00:22:32,965 --> 00:22:35,596
So that is exactly what
I'm gonna do.

263
00:22:38,253 --> 00:22:39,737
Stop slurping!

264
00:22:40,873 --> 00:22:44,078
- Kary, act your age.
- Not your shoe size.

265
00:22:44,078 --> 00:22:47,063
Ma', there's something
I have to tell you.

266
00:22:47,063 --> 00:22:50,800
That's the last of the marigolds. I thought
you should have them over here.

267
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:54,178
- They're dad's favourites.
- I know: that's why Lisa ordered them.

268
00:22:54,529 --> 00:22:56,159
She's a real gem that lassie.

269
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:59,579
You should snap her up before
somebody else does, you know?

270
00:23:00,058 --> 00:23:02,617
- She'd be mad, he's just pure embaressment. (?)
- Morning everyone.

271
00:23:03,395 --> 00:23:04,595
Thought my ears were burning...

272
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:10,324
- You know what they say, Lisa?
- No, what do they say?

273
00:23:10,324 --> 00:23:13,705
What's by you, won't get by you.
Is that not right, Suman?

274
00:23:15,016 --> 00:23:16,676
D'you want some tea?

275
00:23:18,085 --> 00:23:19,347
Thanks.

276
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:21,948
Did you tell them?

277
00:23:22,254 --> 00:23:23,760
Tell them what?

278
00:23:28,998 --> 00:23:30,238
Dad had a secret.

279
00:23:30,238 --> 00:23:32,994
Do you mean his gambling?
Everybody knew about that.

280
00:23:34,595 --> 00:23:38,587
Dad had entered "The Taj" into this year's
competition and he's through to the final.

281
00:23:38,967 --> 00:23:41,929
- Too bad, it's not our restaurant anymore.
- Yes, it is.

282
00:23:41,929 --> 00:23:44,687
It'n not done and dust until we sign.

283
00:23:45,331 --> 00:23:46,574
So we've...

284
00:23:46,968 --> 00:23:51,234
I've... decided to go ahead
and compete in the final.

285
00:23:51,492 --> 00:23:52,701
And Lisa's agreed.

286
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:58,400
- I sent the acceptance forms off this morning.
- Oh, my God! You're gonna be on telly?

287
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,489
Hundreds of people are
gonna see you!

288
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:06,683
- My pals are gonna be drop dead jealous.
- Hold your horses, we may not win.

289
00:24:06,683 --> 00:24:08,569
You had no right.

290
00:24:08,856 --> 00:24:12,090
How dare you come back here and
start disrupting our lives?

291
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:14,741
Haven't you caused yet enough heartache?
- Ma'!

292
00:24:14,741 --> 00:24:18,578
Suman, it will be good for the restaurant.
We can put the price up.

293
00:24:18,578 --> 00:24:22,400
- Thanks very much! I thought we were partners?
- Hey, don't blame her. This was all my idea.

294
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,365
- No it wasn't. I can make up my own mind
- And why is that?

295
00:24:26,029 --> 00:24:28,049
What makes you think you can
do this without dad?

296
00:24:28,049 --> 00:24:30,390
It was his cooking that won
the trophies, not yours.

297
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:33,110
Raj can be that, but trust me
Sanjay's no slouch in the kitchen.

298
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:36,059
You're just gonna end up
humiliating us all over again.

299
00:24:37,574 --> 00:24:39,121
Kary, wait a minute.

300
00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:41,258
That went well.

301
00:24:44,654 --> 00:24:47,457
And to cap it all, through the
whole flaming meal

302
00:24:47,457 --> 00:24:50,493
his eyes were there.
I should never have worn that little top.

303
00:24:50,493 --> 00:24:54,799
Actually, at one point I had to lift his chin up.
I did, to make him look at my face.

304
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:57,643
End of the night: Y'know, he tried to
kiss me. I wasn't going to ask him in.

305
00:24:57,643 --> 00:25:01,228
And I put my hand up just to
sort of stroke his face.

306
00:25:01,723 --> 00:25:04,116
The wig.
- He wears a wig?

307
00:25:04,116 --> 00:25:06,547
I thought it was a bad dye job as well.

308
00:25:06,547 --> 00:25:10,115
But no, I put my hand on. It was like that,
his head moved and the wig...

309
00:25:10,115 --> 00:25:13,235
It's not worth it. Stay in the house,
watch the telly,

310
00:25:13,235 --> 00:25:15,282
with a cup of tea.
Happy, please.

311
00:25:15,282 --> 00:25:17,674
- Hello, darling.
- Hiya.

312
00:25:20,236 --> 00:25:22,269
I'll just go and put the
cattle on then...

313
00:25:25,833 --> 00:25:29,404
Ma', don't be upset, please.

314
00:25:29,816 --> 00:25:31,400
It's for dad.

315
00:25:31,649 --> 00:25:34,282
It's to give him back a little bit of pride.
What's wrong with that?

316
00:25:34,282 --> 00:25:37,060
Pride comes before a fall,
remember that?

317
00:25:38,668 --> 00:25:41,284
You are so like your father.

318
00:25:42,254 --> 00:25:44,419
Here we are, tea's up.

319
00:25:44,726 --> 00:25:46,256
Do you want a wee cup, Nina?

320
00:25:47,243 --> 00:25:49,587
No, I'm fine, thanks, Mamie.

321
00:25:49,927 --> 00:25:52,488
I'll just go and get some biscuits.

322
00:25:53,458 --> 00:25:57,120
And what if you lose?
You've risked everything.

323
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:00,347
If Raj wants "The Taj" badly enough,
he'll still be around.

324
00:26:02,004 --> 00:26:03,997
Don't be too sure of that.

325
00:26:04,602 --> 00:26:06,934
Raj won't always be here.

326
00:26:08,716 --> 00:26:11,277
Not if we keep turning him down.

327
00:26:39,692 --> 00:26:42,777
Slainte!
(Gaelic: Cheers!)

328
00:26:42,846 --> 00:26:44,284
Slainte!

329
00:26:48,392 --> 00:26:51,005
Good, let's get out of here.

330
00:27:19,895 --> 00:27:23,489
- So why did you leave?
- I woke up and I...

331
00:27:23,839 --> 00:27:25,802
I knew I couldn't go through with it.

332
00:27:26,744 --> 00:27:31,054
It was a terrible thing to do, though...
to do a bunk on the day of your wedding.

333
00:27:31,054 --> 00:27:34,020
- Pretty brill, alright.
- I know, I didn't mean to hurt anyone.

334
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:36,328
It's just that I freaked out,
you know?

335
00:27:36,328 --> 00:27:42,190
I mean they had it all mapped out for me.
Marry Sanjay, have lots of little Sanjays.

336
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:44,577
We'd have "The Taj" and "The Jewel".

337
00:27:45,342 --> 00:27:48,765
They saw us as this power
cooking couple.

338
00:27:49,147 --> 00:27:51,944
"The couple that cooks together,
stays together."

339
00:27:53,625 --> 00:27:55,354
I just didn't love him.

340
00:27:55,354 --> 00:27:57,625
- No such thing.
- As love?

341
00:27:57,625 --> 00:27:59,637
There isn't, it's just a big con.

342
00:28:00,663 --> 00:28:02,107
See, your dad taught you how to cook,

343
00:28:02,107 --> 00:28:05,191
my dad taught me: never gamble with
something you're not prepared to lose.

344
00:28:05,191 --> 00:28:06,970
Once you realise that
you get along fine.

345
00:28:08,183 --> 00:28:09,811
The other way's just a
recipe for disaster.

346
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,530
Can you cook?

347
00:28:14,869 --> 00:28:17,950
I can make a mean fried egg and
burn sauce sandwich.

348
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:21,316
- I don't do indian...
- Well, apart from my brother.

349
00:28:22,632 --> 00:28:25,510
I've always admired your dad's
chicken xacuti.

350
00:28:27,327 --> 00:28:28,658
Me too...

351
00:28:30,927 --> 00:28:33,016
Race you to the bike.

352
00:29:00,654 --> 00:29:02,625
Oh, ma', don't, please...

353
00:29:02,944 --> 00:29:05,385
I don't want you
to do that just yet.

354
00:29:06,339 --> 00:29:10,272
Funny, isn't it? Nobody's ever
asked me what I want.

355
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:12,939
Your dad never asked me much.

356
00:29:13,199 --> 00:29:15,781
But then, he never told me
much, either.

357
00:29:16,307 --> 00:29:18,634
He thought I didn't know
what was going on.

358
00:29:21,406 --> 00:29:25,353
I knew exactly what was going on.
I was married to him for 30 years.

359
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,168
Ma'...

360
00:29:37,557 --> 00:29:41,211
Ma', I cannot find the peanut butter,
and Kary's finished all the bread.

361
00:29:41,816 --> 00:29:43,300
Come on, sweetheart.

362
00:30:02,514 --> 00:30:05,016
Don't tell, please.

363
00:30:08,501 --> 00:30:11,895
I'm not supposed to be going back
to dancing. Dad banned me.

364
00:30:12,196 --> 00:30:13,436
Why?

365
00:30:14,033 --> 00:30:17,560
I don't know. After you left
he went all funny.

366
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,166
Are you any good at it?

367
00:30:29,856 --> 00:30:31,475
Holly shit!

368
00:30:31,475 --> 00:30:34,983
I've been offered a place in the county
team. That's a big deal, you know.

369
00:30:35,309 --> 00:30:38,336
- I'm sure.
- I've turned it down.

370
00:30:42,555 --> 00:30:44,805
Do you think he's still here, Nina?

371
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:52,261
I don't know...

372
00:30:53,617 --> 00:30:55,052
Maybe...

373
00:30:57,579 --> 00:30:58,997
I hope so...

374
00:31:01,752 --> 00:31:05,852
Please, don't tell. I don't want
anybody to know, 'right?

375
00:31:05,852 --> 00:31:09,071
- OK.
- Especially, Kary. He's been such an arse.

376
00:31:09,071 --> 00:31:13,275
He's bought lots of new clothes, dead
expensive. He's trying to impress Lisa.

377
00:31:13,275 --> 00:31:15,875
But he's going about it
all the wrong way.

378
00:31:15,875 --> 00:31:20,510
- And since when are you such an expert on romance?
- I've got eyes. I see things.

379
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:26,691
I've told you a secret.
Now you need to tell me one.

380
00:31:27,091 --> 00:31:29,226
I don't have any secrets.

381
00:31:45,029 --> 00:31:47,701
<b>"Mohan Shan. Award winning recipes"</b>

382
00:31:51,585 --> 00:31:55,000
Garlic purifies the blood and
keeps the skin glowing.

383
00:31:55,273 --> 00:31:59,156
Frying garlic lightly enhances
its therapeutic action.

384
00:31:59,156 --> 00:32:04,370
The golden brown colour of this dish
signifies optimism and will dispell gloom.

385
00:32:12,794 --> 00:32:15,840
- This is so better be worth it.
- Thanks.

386
00:32:17,476 --> 00:32:22,068
- OK, who are we up against?
- OK: The "Bengal Tiger".

387
00:32:22,692 --> 00:32:24,041
Pussycat.

388
00:32:24,298 --> 00:32:28,052
- Unless it's under new management...
- It is...

389
00:32:32,882 --> 00:32:36,945
- "Bimal's Balti and Dosa House".
- Last year's winners.

390
00:32:39,229 --> 00:32:41,882
And then last, but never least...

391
00:32:42,803 --> 00:32:44,786
"The Jewel in the Crown".

392
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:54,308
- It's in the bag.
- Oh yeah, it's in the bag.

393
00:33:04,493 --> 00:33:06,250
Who's Lorna?

394
00:33:07,364 --> 00:33:09,626
Nina + Lorna = True love
Decembre 1988

395
00:33:09,937 --> 00:33:11,723
I don't know...
I've no idea...

396
00:33:13,665 --> 00:33:15,199
Lorna...

397
00:33:16,126 --> 00:33:17,720
Lorna Mallen!

398
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,486
I remember Lorna.

399
00:33:20,113 --> 00:33:23,813
Captain of the school hockey team.
Big blue eyes.

400
00:33:24,621 --> 00:33:27,876
Tall.
Legs right up to her oxsters.

401
00:33:28,206 --> 00:33:30,017
I am schocked!

402
00:33:30,761 --> 00:33:32,928
I wouldn't have thought
she was your type.

403
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:36,714
She wasn't my type.
I was 9.

404
00:33:36,714 --> 00:33:38,903
I had a crush on the world and his wife

405
00:33:39,113 --> 00:33:41,575
when I was 9.
- Me too.

406
00:34:29,817 --> 00:34:32,980
- Look how I'm going!
-  Is that nice?

407
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:35,215
- Yeah, go faster.
- No...

408
00:35:00,776 --> 00:35:05,318
Green and green.
And the difference is..?

409
00:35:05,793 --> 00:35:06,950
Winning...

410
00:35:07,301 --> 00:35:08,648
and losing.

411
00:35:39,794 --> 00:35:42,646
You've got pure cheek. You're
supposed to pay with nothing for them?

412
00:35:42,966 --> 00:35:46,935
- Janice, not now, just put it on the account, OK?
- You'll get no more credit here.

413
00:35:46,935 --> 00:35:49,499
- It's OK, Janice. I'll sort it.
- But Kary...

414
00:35:49,499 --> 00:35:50,941
It's OK, I'll handle it.

415
00:35:51,524 --> 00:35:54,525
- What is her problem?
- You should've cleared this with me first.

416
00:35:54,802 --> 00:35:57,204
- Is there a problem here?
- No Sanjay, no problem.

417
00:35:57,204 --> 00:35:58,954
I'm just getting Nina her change.

418
00:36:00,883 --> 00:36:02,338
Gee, thanks.

419
00:36:04,712 --> 00:36:05,856
Nina.

420
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:12,625
Maybe we could go out sometime.
For a drink or something.

421
00:36:12,625 --> 00:36:15,057
- I know this really good club.
- I don't think so.

422
00:36:15,057 --> 00:36:19,728
- What's the point of raking up old ground?
- No old ground, fresh start.

423
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:24,223
Maybe we could just talk about "The Taj".
See, I've got some plans, really big plans.

424
00:36:24,466 --> 00:36:28,283
Well, I'm afraid they might have to wait
for a bit, Sanjay. We're not ready to sell.

425
00:36:28,283 --> 00:36:30,608
- I'm sorry.
- Since when?

426
00:36:30,878 --> 00:36:33,320
Since Lisa and I decided not to.

427
00:36:34,485 --> 00:36:37,348
"The Bengal Tiger."
"Bimal's House."

428
00:36:37,348 --> 00:36:39,154
"The Jewel in the Crown".

429
00:36:44,637 --> 00:36:48,248
I've used all 20 of my Weight Watchers
points already today.

430
00:36:48,248 --> 00:36:49,826
Know thy enemy.

431
00:36:50,441 --> 00:36:51,830
Right,
go on.

432
00:36:52,675 --> 00:36:55,255
I need you to know the difference
for when you taste mine.

433
00:37:00,427 --> 00:37:01,884
It's delicious.

434
00:37:01,884 --> 00:37:06,106
It's terrible. They didn't marinate
the meat long enough.

435
00:37:06,106 --> 00:37:09,761
The longer you marinate it,
the more tender it becomes.

436
00:37:10,286 --> 00:37:11,366
Taste that...

437
00:37:16,034 --> 00:37:17,141
Well?

438
00:37:17,790 --> 00:37:21,091
- That's better.
- What's better about it?

439
00:37:22,096 --> 00:37:23,394
I don't know.

440
00:37:24,972 --> 00:37:26,370
Go on...

441
00:37:27,330 --> 00:37:29,249
It's not so overpowering.

442
00:37:29,869 --> 00:37:32,763
Good, you're getting it.

443
00:37:33,953 --> 00:37:37,994
OK, now I'm gonna show you
how it's really done.

444
00:37:43,451 --> 00:37:45,074
Put it on.

445
00:37:47,507 --> 00:37:48,774
Not yet.

446
00:37:49,258 --> 00:37:53,484
Right, let's see if I can remember
how to fly this thing.

447
00:37:59,476 --> 00:38:02,975
It's all about chemistry.

448
00:38:11,062 --> 00:38:15,347
And the chemistry has to be right.

449
00:38:21,472 --> 00:38:22,871
Your turn.

450
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:33,562
OK, slow down. Don't beat it into
submission, just coax it.

451
00:38:33,562 --> 00:38:35,162
Gently.

452
00:38:41,706 --> 00:38:43,020
Pretty good.

453
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:29,705
OK, OK, you need to wash it out
with cold water, immediately.

454
00:39:30,346 --> 00:39:33,822
- Don't rub it, you'll make it worse.
- Oh what, now she tells me?

455
00:39:33,823 --> 00:39:34,823
Here.

456
00:39:35,147 --> 00:39:36,518
OK?

457
00:39:37,554 --> 00:39:39,133
OK, let me see how that is.

458
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,286
Let me see.

459
00:39:42,326 --> 00:39:43,681
Let me see.

460
00:39:48,189 --> 00:39:49,744
Yeah, you'll live.

461
00:39:50,628 --> 00:39:52,665
You sound like my doctor.

462
00:39:53,542 --> 00:39:56,858
Thought that was meant to be me.
What happened?

463
00:39:58,282 --> 00:40:01,984
- Just got some plutonium in my eye.
- Chilli.

464
00:40:02,213 --> 00:40:06,005
- Cold water. You need to wash it out.
- Is there an echo in here?

465
00:40:07,317 --> 00:40:08,683
You'll live.

466
00:40:10,303 --> 00:40:14,000
<b>- Still not talking to me then?
- Just. Still up for going out later?</b>

467
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,654
What choice have I got?

468
00:40:17,251 --> 00:40:19,661
And, by the way, you owe me 10 quid.

469
00:40:27,485 --> 00:40:29,798
At least he's not taking
it out on you.

470
00:40:29,798 --> 00:40:32,800
He wouldn't dare. He needs
me too much.

471
00:40:38,669 --> 00:40:40,467
<b>ginger</b>

472
00:40:41,373 --> 00:40:43,405
<b>turmeric</b>

473
00:40:44,504 --> 00:40:46,043
<b>garam masala</b>

474
00:40:50,164 --> 00:40:51,164
<b>garlic</b>

475
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:54,588
<b>cumin</b>

476
00:40:58,777 --> 00:41:00,866
<b>coriander</b>

477
00:41:12,679 --> 00:41:13,319
Mmm.

478
00:41:20,663 --> 00:41:23,486
- This is shit.
- What?!!

479
00:41:29,306 --> 00:41:33,573
Kary was right. I can't
do this without my dad.

480
00:41:38,330 --> 00:41:41,273
No, Mamie, I don't mind;
I need to keep busy.

481
00:41:41,273 --> 00:41:44,026
- Ma'?
- Just a moment.

482
00:41:46,131 --> 00:41:49,719
You were right.
Beggars can't be chosers.

483
00:41:49,719 --> 00:41:51,286
Let's go see Raj.

484
00:41:52,681 --> 00:41:54,153
I'll call you back.

485
00:42:16,594 --> 00:42:18,030
Ready, Nina?

486
00:42:28,057 --> 00:42:32,153
Here's to us, in business
and in pleasure.

487
00:42:33,063 --> 00:42:35,695
I'll call the lawyer and
we'll sign tomorrow.

488
00:42:38,943 --> 00:42:43,027
Now, I'll say one thing to you, Nina,
you sure know how to keep a man dangling.

489
00:42:45,461 --> 00:42:51,311
Nina, we both know how hard this is for
you and what "The Taj" means to you.

490
00:42:51,891 --> 00:42:57,608
Don't worry, we'll take good care of it. And
your mother can stay for as long as she likes.

491
00:42:57,608 --> 00:43:01,451
It will always be your home.
- Thank you, Raj.

492
00:43:01,451 --> 00:43:03,938
Good. Now, let's eat.

493
00:43:11,913 --> 00:43:15,485
Nina, I hope that full plate is not
a reflection on the food?

494
00:43:15,485 --> 00:43:19,273
Oh, no, it's lovely, Raj. It's just
that I'm not very hungry.

495
00:43:19,273 --> 00:43:23,229
Lovely? Geez! Down with faint
praise, huh?

496
00:43:23,229 --> 00:43:27,520
Come on, Nina. You could bee more specific
than that. Tell us what you really think?

497
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:47,509
Don't rush it, mind you.
Take your time.

498
00:43:47,509 --> 00:43:49,718
Wouldn't want you to make
another snap decision.

499
00:43:54,526 --> 00:43:55,684
Well?

500
00:43:57,767 --> 00:44:01,450
Technically, it's very good.

501
00:44:01,682 --> 00:44:03,202
Technically?

502
00:44:04,401 --> 00:44:07,606
- But there's something missing.
- Missing?

503
00:44:08,199 --> 00:44:10,800
- Nina...
- All the ingredients are there...

504
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:14,249
I can taste all the flavours;
it's just there's something...

505
00:44:15,281 --> 00:44:16,739
I don't know...

506
00:44:17,897 --> 00:44:18,841
Ha!

507
00:44:18,919 --> 00:44:20,696
It's the chemistry.

508
00:44:21,263 --> 00:44:22,758
It's not quite right.

509
00:44:28,138 --> 00:44:33,223
You know, maybe it's a good thing that
you won't be cooking in the competition.

510
00:44:34,201 --> 00:44:39,138
After all, I wouldn't want my
public ass kicked twice.

511
00:44:41,037 --> 00:44:45,664
You know, maybe we should employ you, Nina.
Then you could come and cook for us.

512
00:44:46,077 --> 00:44:48,737
I don't cook for anyone
except for my dad.

513
00:44:48,998 --> 00:44:50,666
Well, that's a shame.

514
00:44:51,580 --> 00:44:53,954
You don't want to be on
the winning team, Nina?

515
00:44:54,256 --> 00:44:56,350
I've always been on
the winning team.

516
00:44:56,850 --> 00:45:00,272
We've won twice before.
Remember?

517
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:02,722
That was then.

518
00:45:04,388 --> 00:45:06,575
And this is now.

519
00:45:08,311 --> 00:45:11,249
No sale 'till after the competition.

520
00:45:12,715 --> 00:45:16,516
You're just like Mohan.
Red rag to a bull.

521
00:45:19,521 --> 00:45:23,542
Alright, have it your way.
May the best man win.

522
00:45:25,514 --> 00:45:27,195
Or woman.

523
00:45:30,605 --> 00:45:31,961
Cheers!

524
00:45:43,830 --> 00:45:45,466
Hiya, girls.

525
00:45:45,730 --> 00:45:49,115
Hey, I thought you were rehearsing.
"Night and day." - We are.

526
00:45:49,115 --> 00:45:53,736
- We're just gonna do it in front of the mob.
- That may give us the extra push that we need.

527
00:45:54,136 --> 00:45:56,377
Over the nearest cliff,
preferably.

528
00:45:57,464 --> 00:45:58,731
Coming?

529
00:45:59,176 --> 00:46:00,459
Yeah.

530
00:46:00,872 --> 00:46:03,060
Not dressed like that.

531
00:46:26,193 --> 00:46:27,283
Nina!

532
00:46:36,276 --> 00:46:38,800
- Oh, it's you...
- Don't worry, little brother.

533
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:41,701
I won't cramp your style.
I'm here with Bobbi.

534
00:46:41,701 --> 00:46:43,742
You two won't even know we're here.

535
00:46:43,963 --> 00:46:46,152
Does that come with an off switch?

536
00:47:15,030 --> 00:47:19,063
Good evening, Glasgow.
Sorry to be on time. (?)

537
00:48:16,882 --> 00:48:19,158
- Nina.
- Sanjay.

538
00:49:37,934 --> 00:49:41,361
Sorry to interrupt, but do you
fancy sharing a cab?

539
00:49:41,361 --> 00:49:44,520
- Coming.
- You may be.

540
00:49:47,578 --> 00:49:49,563
- Janice and I are...
- I can see that.

541
00:49:49,563 --> 00:49:50,946
We are married.

542
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:55,606
I'm fed up waiting, I don't want you
to do anymore because I pure love you.

543
00:49:58,205 --> 00:50:00,120
- We sneaked away.
- To Gretna.

544
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:02,630
- Dead predictable.
- Dead romantic.

545
00:50:02,630 --> 00:50:03,988
Nobody else knows.

546
00:50:04,368 --> 00:50:05,849
Except Lisa.

547
00:50:07,054 --> 00:50:13,020
- She's been terrified to tell her dad, he's a...
- Deadweight. He's a pure bum.

548
00:50:17,169 --> 00:50:19,309
"Another one bites the dust."

549
00:50:51,176 --> 00:50:52,916
So, beer?

550
00:50:54,648 --> 00:50:57,571
I'm pure tired.
I'll go to bed.

551
00:51:56,760 --> 00:51:58,634
I thought you and Kary were...

552
00:53:07,912 --> 00:53:10,409
<i>Oh, what a relief! What a relief!</i>

553
00:53:10,409 --> 00:53:14,827
<i>Mrs. Khan's cat, the wee nipper
has been spotted in Dundee...</i>

554
00:53:17,396 --> 00:53:21,896
<i>Last night, I was lucky to be
a guest of the "Bengal Tiger" in Bearsden.</i>

555
00:53:22,175 --> 00:53:24,018
<i>Oh, the food was gorgeous!</i>

556
00:53:24,739 --> 00:53:26,690
<i>Don't forget, we only have a week left</i>

557
00:53:26,690 --> 00:53:31,118
<i>before Scotlands biggest event,
"The Best of the West" curry competition.</i>

558
00:54:24,985 --> 00:54:26,099
What?!!

559
00:54:47,796 --> 00:54:49,568
I really want this...

560
00:54:49,923 --> 00:54:51,288
me and you...

561
00:54:51,577 --> 00:54:53,850
I've never felt like this before.

562
00:54:53,850 --> 00:54:55,605
Let's tell everyone.

563
00:54:55,605 --> 00:54:58,845
I've gotta go...
I can't do this just now, Lisa.

564
00:55:46,812 --> 00:55:51,167
Hey, you lot, show's over.
People to go, places to see.

565
00:55:53,937 --> 00:55:58,484
Bobbi, can you do the Pocahontas tomorrow?

566
00:55:58,484 --> 00:56:02,070
Alright, bring the video.
See you tomorrow.

567
00:56:07,544 --> 00:56:10,165
So tell all, my sweet chilli bean.

568
00:56:10,165 --> 00:56:12,305
I didn't mean for this to happen.

569
00:56:15,111 --> 00:56:16,807
What do I do?

570
00:56:17,738 --> 00:56:21,781
- Go with your heart.
- And lose everything?

571
00:56:21,781 --> 00:56:25,674
Not everything. You didn't think twice
about that when you ran away...

572
00:56:25,674 --> 00:56:27,839
I know, but I missed them, Bobbi.

573
00:56:28,044 --> 00:56:29,790
I missed you.

574
00:56:29,790 --> 00:56:32,693
All I ever wanted to do was come home.

575
00:56:32,693 --> 00:56:35,151
Aye, you're home now.

576
00:56:37,212 --> 00:56:39,701
Why can't you just say it?

577
00:56:44,419 --> 00:56:49,047
Because... If I say it, then
there's no going back.

578
00:56:52,901 --> 00:56:54,334
I can't.

579
00:56:55,076 --> 00:57:00,577
Not here. Not under their roof. My mum
would never be able to accept it.

580
00:57:01,620 --> 00:57:04,001
I don't want to have to run again, Bobbi.

581
00:57:04,001 --> 00:57:09,444
You can't plan for love, Nina Bina.
It just sneaks up on you...

582
00:57:11,701 --> 00:57:14,681
When you least expect it.
- Hello.

583
00:57:15,237 --> 00:57:18,274
We're gonna have to stop meeting like this.
- That's original...

584
00:57:18,274 --> 00:57:22,038
Or steady and reliable. Depends
which way you look at it.

585
00:57:30,168 --> 00:57:32,503
I'd give anything to be more like you.

586
00:57:32,503 --> 00:57:36,207
With my dress sense?
Deceit is not an option.

587
00:57:41,443 --> 00:57:43,304
Do you love her?

588
00:59:14,923 --> 00:59:19,512
- I thought you did a runner on me.
- Not yet, but I'm thinking about it.

589
00:59:19,774 --> 00:59:22,086
Of course you are. That's what
you always do.

590
00:59:22,086 --> 00:59:26,074
Look Lisa, let's just get on
with the cooking for now.

591
00:59:30,853 --> 00:59:34,172
- What's this?
- Costumer feedback forms.

592
00:59:34,733 --> 00:59:37,531
Was the food:
A. To die for,

593
00:59:37,531 --> 00:59:41,906
B. Okayish,
or C. Pure disgusting?

594
00:59:42,121 --> 00:59:44,900
And you, please, write legibly.

595
00:59:44,900 --> 00:59:47,402
Kiss my...

596
01:00:02,834 --> 01:00:05,430
Hi, I'm sorry to bother you, I
was looking for Priya Shah.

597
01:00:05,430 --> 01:00:08,011
There was a dance practice
tonight but she didn't show.

598
01:00:08,011 --> 01:00:09,197
She's inside. Come in.

599
01:00:09,197 --> 01:00:11,596
Better not.
Just tell her Ravi bumped. (?)

600
01:00:11,596 --> 01:00:13,040
Ravi.

601
01:00:14,198 --> 01:00:15,420
Are you hungry?

602
01:00:15,420 --> 01:00:20,623
I always thought he had a fabulous--

603
01:00:21,715 --> 01:00:26,591
- Everybody, this is Priya's friend, Ravi.
- Hello, Ravi.

604
01:00:26,793 --> 01:00:31,355
- I hope you're not all waiting for me.
- At last! Where have you been? We're starving.

605
01:00:31,355 --> 01:00:34,117
Oh dear, the food must be cold by now.

606
01:00:34,820 --> 01:00:36,423
Welcome, young man.

607
01:00:36,684 --> 01:00:40,212
Priya, don't be rude.
Offer your friend a chair.

608
01:00:47,637 --> 01:00:48,878
Ready, Nina?

609
01:00:52,740 --> 01:00:54,050
To begin with,

610
01:00:54,050 --> 01:00:58,148
everybody's favourite, the house
speciality: chicken xacuti.

611
01:00:58,148 --> 01:01:01,590
The chicken is marinated in
over 20 herbs and spices,

612
01:01:01,590 --> 01:01:05,032
and cooked slowly in sweet
fresh coconut juice.

613
01:01:05,032 --> 01:01:07,939
Tender lamb chops
with garam masala

614
01:01:07,939 --> 01:01:10,499
cooked in a rich tomato and onion sauce.

615
01:01:13,914 --> 01:01:15,349
King prawns:

616
01:01:15,349 --> 01:01:20,900
simmered in special spices and then
charcoal grilled to perfection in the tandoor.
(tandoor = indian clay oven)

617
01:01:21,015 --> 01:01:25,250
"Jeera aloo": potatoes cooked in
roasted cumin seeds

618
01:01:25,250 --> 01:01:28,815
with fresh wild mushrooms,
toasted almonds and curry leaves.

619
01:01:29,027 --> 01:01:34,040
Pilaw rice infused with golden saffron.
And then finally,

620
01:01:34,299 --> 01:01:36,967
My assistant, Lisa,
has prepared chapatis.

621
01:01:36,967 --> 01:01:39,194
Individually designed especially
for each of you.

622
01:01:39,194 --> 01:01:40,313
Enjoy!

623
01:01:40,515 --> 01:01:42,903
Well done, Nina.

624
01:01:46,057 --> 01:01:48,153
These prawns
are my favourite.

625
01:01:48,391 --> 01:01:50,511
Kary, pass the rice down.

626
01:02:04,994 --> 01:02:06,419
Spicy...

627
01:02:26,282 --> 01:02:27,616
Hiya.

628
01:02:28,022 --> 01:02:30,209
The entertainment's arrived.

629
01:02:30,209 --> 01:02:33,075
- Nina, more chicken xacuti
- No way.

630
01:02:33,075 --> 01:02:36,046
I couldn't dance for a boolly with
blockbuster on a full stomach.

631
01:02:36,685 --> 01:02:39,282
We couldn't force one single
mussel down our guts .

632
01:02:40,382 --> 01:02:42,849
- The audition's in an hour.
- Come on...

633
01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:46,408
- Hey, you OK?
- Hmm... You?

634
01:02:47,415 --> 01:02:49,082
It's now or never, Nina.

635
01:02:51,521 --> 01:02:53,998
Come on, Priya, read all the comments.

636
01:02:54,535 --> 01:02:58,273
This one's Ravi's: "The sauce on
the lamb was too sweet."

637
01:02:58,616 --> 01:03:02,365
And he wasn't that into lentils.
They're still stuck in his teeth.

638
01:03:02,365 --> 01:03:06,188
- Difficult crowd tonight.
- You've got to be cruel to be kind.

639
01:03:06,188 --> 01:03:09,020
Oh, don't listen to them.
It was lovely.

640
01:03:09,721 --> 01:03:12,210
- Great.
- It's alright.

641
01:03:13,377 --> 01:03:16,846
Truth? Sanjay's a black belt
curry master.

642
01:03:16,846 --> 01:03:19,150
If you want to win, you'll have
to be in the top of your game.

643
01:03:19,150 --> 01:03:24,075
So what? Nina's a curry ninja.
She's not scared of a bum like Sanjay.

644
01:03:24,075 --> 01:03:25,882
Bring it on!

645
01:03:28,166 --> 01:03:29,769
What would dad say?

646
01:03:30,533 --> 01:03:32,099
Your dad would say:

647
01:03:32,468 --> 01:03:37,243
"You're so close to winning now that
you can't let anything stand in your way."

648
01:03:37,681 --> 01:03:41,047
That's not what he'd say, Nina.
You know exactly what he'd say.

649
01:03:41,354 --> 01:03:42,994
"Follow your heart."

650
01:03:43,982 --> 01:03:45,203
Thanks.

651
01:03:46,384 --> 01:03:48,304
Dad's still here, you know?

652
01:03:48,305 --> 01:03:50,463
Oh, sweethart.

653
01:03:50,498 --> 01:03:52,306
Oh, pettit.

654
01:03:54,997 --> 01:03:57,499
<i>Cheer up, sleepy Jean,</i>

655
01:03:58,633 --> 01:04:00,361
<i>Oh, what can it mean</i>

656
01:04:01,495 --> 01:04:04,783
<i>To a daydream believer</i>

657
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:08,031
<i>and a homecoming queen?</i>

658
01:04:10,965 --> 01:04:14,131
<i>Cheer up, sleepy Jean,</i>

659
01:04:15,019 --> 01:04:16,932
<i>Oh, what can it mean</i>

660
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:20,794
<i>To a daydream believer</i>

661
01:04:21,557 --> 01:04:25,407
<i>and a homecoming queen?</i>

662
01:04:43,708 --> 01:04:45,867
<i>Cheer up, sleepy Jean,</i>

663
01:04:47,169 --> 01:04:49,826
<i>Oh, what can it mean</i>

664
01:04:50,832 --> 01:04:53,553
<i>To a daydream believer</i>

665
01:04:54,416 --> 01:04:57,887
<i>and a homecoming queen?</i>

666
01:04:58,650 --> 01:05:01,844
- Wish me luck.
- Luck!

667
01:05:03,437 --> 01:05:04,555
Go, and be wonderest.

668
01:05:04,999 --> 01:05:07,196
Come on, Bobbi. Gotta get
the boys on the bridge.

669
01:05:10,038 --> 01:05:11,173
Bye!

670
01:05:12,888 --> 01:05:14,372
Whoa!

671
01:05:30,818 --> 01:05:33,730
- Have you changed the batteries?
- Twice.

672
01:05:36,677 --> 01:05:38,350
It's beautiful, isn't it?

673
01:05:39,756 --> 01:05:42,938
A beautiful monument
to eternal love.

674
01:05:44,334 --> 01:05:46,010
You don't believe in love.

675
01:05:46,695 --> 01:05:50,919
Your dad said some king spent 22 years
building it for his queen.

676
01:05:51,354 --> 01:05:52,641
Dead queen.

677
01:05:53,464 --> 01:05:55,502
It's a monument to grief.

678
01:05:56,328 --> 01:06:00,446
Same thing. If he'd come from Nashville,
he would have written a song about it.

679
01:06:11,086 --> 01:06:12,719
I can't.

680
01:06:13,343 --> 01:06:14,987
Yes, you can.

681
01:06:15,537 --> 01:06:16,841
Look at me.

682
01:06:22,599 --> 01:06:24,832
We should throw that dull thing out.

683
01:06:25,250 --> 01:06:27,361
- It's broken.
- It's not broken.

684
01:06:27,361 --> 01:06:29,396
It just needs new batteries.

685
01:06:29,396 --> 01:06:31,564
Nina, what do you think?

686
01:06:40,360 --> 01:06:41,680
<i>Keep stirring.</i>

687
01:06:41,680 --> 01:06:46,000
<i>Keep it moving. Cover every
inch with the sauce.</i>

688
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:51,600
<i>Taste it.
Taste it in your heart.</i>

689
01:06:51,840 --> 01:06:54,700
<i>No matter what the recipe says, pettit,</i>

690
01:06:54,799 --> 01:06:57,199
<i>always follow your heart.</i>

691
01:07:37,758 --> 01:07:40,518
"Baste every 5 minutes,

692
01:07:40,718 --> 01:07:44,638
using the succulent juices from
the bottom of the roasting dish.

693
01:07:45,077 --> 01:07:48,517
Remember. Every 5.

694
01:07:50,597 --> 01:07:53,997
Leave it any longer and
the meat will dry out.

695
01:07:55,637 --> 01:07:57,999
It will taste like bloody shoe leather.

696
01:07:58,237 --> 01:08:00,437
Not that I've tasted shoe leather.

697
01:08:00,757 --> 01:08:06,557
Apart from Raj's bloody chicken xacuti.
that is. Which is a crime against humanity,

698
01:08:06,757 --> 01:08:08,437
and shoes."

699
01:08:08,757 --> 01:08:11,716
<i>Bring a large pan of water to the boil.</i>

700
01:08:11,716 --> 01:08:14,516
"Bring a large pan of water to the boil."

701
01:08:14,756 --> 01:08:15,888
<i>Measure the rice.</i>

702
01:08:16,357 --> 01:08:17,357
"Measure the rice."

703
01:08:17,876 --> 01:08:19,836
<i>No need to weight up.</i>

704
01:08:21,996 --> 01:08:26,516
"Use your heart, pettit,
not the scales."

705
01:08:47,361 --> 01:08:50,314
It's not "The Taj" that Sanjay's
interested in.

706
01:08:50,314 --> 01:08:52,358
You know that, don't you?

707
01:08:53,803 --> 01:08:56,698
Love isn't the be-all and end-all,
Nina.

708
01:08:57,557 --> 01:08:59,251
I don't believe that.

709
01:09:00,262 --> 01:09:02,349
I can't believe that.

710
01:09:02,891 --> 01:09:05,227
You could have learned
to love Sanjay.

711
01:09:05,816 --> 01:09:08,528
- Then you'd never have left.
- Ma'...

712
01:09:09,236 --> 01:09:10,667
Look:

713
01:09:12,182 --> 01:09:17,914
You know, dad used to tell me about
your honeymoon at the Taj Mahal.

714
01:09:18,348 --> 01:09:23,632
And all the time that he talked about it,
he had this,

715
01:09:23,935 --> 01:09:28,054
this look on his face. That's how I want
someone to look when they talk about me.

716
01:09:29,504 --> 01:09:34,083
It's not Sanjay's fault, but
he could never look like that.

717
01:10:57,679 --> 01:10:59,728
You are stunning.

718
01:11:07,338 --> 01:11:09,862
- What?
- It's yours.

719
01:11:13,224 --> 01:11:14,713
Thank you.

720
01:11:42,377 --> 01:11:45,738
<i>Hold me back!</i>

721
01:11:48,078 --> 01:11:53,425
<i>Make sure tonight you don't miss the finale of
"The Best of the West" curry competition,</i>

722
01:11:53,642 --> 01:11:56,560
<i>going out live on "Korma TV".</i>

723
01:12:01,168 --> 01:12:05,472
Look at this. Please, stand up.
Let's have a look.

724
01:12:07,651 --> 01:12:12,007
I had forgotten how
beautiful these are.

725
01:12:12,664 --> 01:12:14,805
I'd completely forgotten.

726
01:12:15,043 --> 01:12:16,484
I hadn't.

727
01:12:23,783 --> 01:12:27,680
- So, have you decided yet?
- No, she hasn't.

728
01:12:27,680 --> 01:12:29,727
It's gotta be special.

729
01:12:29,971 --> 01:12:32,073
We don't have much time.
The clock's ticking.

730
01:12:32,073 --> 01:12:37,012
Maybe we could just pick up a few fish suppers
on the way and curry them when we get there?!!

731
01:12:37,745 --> 01:12:42,022
- Do haggis for curries?!!
- Tender baby lamb...

732
01:12:42,592 --> 01:12:45,825
simmered in a  ginger
and garam masala,

733
01:12:46,362 --> 01:12:50,320
followed by "pomigrani" chicken
with rose petals.

734
01:12:50,320 --> 01:12:55,155
- And a light ginger sherbet for desert.
- Your wedding banquet!

735
01:12:55,531 --> 01:12:58,861
Of course. That's what he'd want.

736
01:12:59,282 --> 01:13:01,479
And maybe, chicken xacuti?

737
01:13:01,837 --> 01:13:05,109
"Best chicken xacuti this side of Maryhill."

738
01:13:12,423 --> 01:13:15,479
- Bobbi, where is he?
- He'll be here, I promise.

739
01:13:16,285 --> 01:13:18,483
We're still inside, Kary.

740
01:13:19,309 --> 01:13:22,875
I'm sorry I'm late.
Got a flat tire...

741
01:13:22,875 --> 01:13:24,447
Where's Priya?

742
01:14:01,336 --> 01:14:04,600
Not every family do get to have
a champion dancer.

743
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:06,870
I'm glad you kept on going.

744
01:14:07,135 --> 01:14:08,515
Come.

745
01:14:09,216 --> 01:14:10,925
Oh, what the hell...

746
01:14:13,200 --> 01:14:15,609
There's something I need to tell you, ma'.

747
01:14:19,863 --> 01:14:21,356
I'm married.

748
01:14:26,300 --> 01:14:28,774
Her name's Janice, and
I pure love her.

749
01:14:34,745 --> 01:14:36,067
Well...

750
01:14:37,764 --> 01:14:40,549
It seems I have a lot to
learn about love.

751
01:14:48,245 --> 01:14:51,883
My children seem to understand it
much better than I do.

752
01:14:55,220 --> 01:14:57,224
Any more bombshells?

753
01:15:05,472 --> 01:15:09,600
Come on, let's go. We're gonna be late.
I don't wanna miss being on the telly.

754
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:11,113
Let's go.

755
01:15:30,848 --> 01:15:32,469
It's right here.

756
01:15:38,455 --> 01:15:40,590
1, 2, 3.

757
01:15:40,590 --> 01:15:43,559
Chicken xacuti!

758
01:15:51,387 --> 01:15:53,908
You're looking wonderful.

759
01:15:57,008 --> 01:15:59,967
Well I hope you're firing on
all cylinders tonight, Sanjay.

760
01:15:59,967 --> 01:16:02,850
Nina's cooking a wedding
banquet fit for a king.

761
01:16:02,850 --> 01:16:05,268
That's just what I want to hear.

762
01:16:05,538 --> 01:16:06,938
We should go?

763
01:16:15,706 --> 01:16:18,712
<i>5, 4, 3, 2.</i>

764
01:16:23,616 --> 01:16:28,154
<i>Good evening, Scotland
and Mumbai!</i>

765
01:16:28,154 --> 01:16:32,891
<i>And welcome to this final of
"The Best of the West".</i>

766
01:16:34,208 --> 01:16:36,861
<i>We've got quite a feast to
serve up tonight</i>

767
01:16:36,861 --> 01:16:41,671
<i>and I sincerely hope you have will the
stomach to make it to the final course!</i>

768
01:16:41,998 --> 01:16:44,692
<i>Hold me back!
Hold me back!</i>

01:16:45,917 --> 01:16:48,401
<i>And in the blue zone...</i>

770
01:16:52,927 --> 01:16:55,132
<i>"The Bengal Tiger" from Bearsden.</i>

771
01:17:04,326 --> 01:17:06,713
Mum, this is Janice.

772
01:17:06,713 --> 01:17:10,480
Don't be angry with him, Miss Shah.
It was all my idea.

773
01:17:10,480 --> 01:17:11,684
I pure love him.

774
01:17:11,880 --> 01:17:13,684
<i>- And in the yellow zone...</i>

775
01:17:14,684 --> 01:17:15,046
Good.

776
01:17:16,956 --> 01:17:18,279
Good.

777

<i>...are going to entice us with a spicy chicken roll,
flavoured with mixed indian pickles,</i>

<i>stuffed with fresh garden spinache.</i>

779
01:17:26,434 --> 01:17:30,739
<i>And in the green zone...</i>

780
01:17:31,042 --> 01:17:34,600
<i>Sanjay Kahnna
of the "Jewel in the Crown".</i>

781
01:17:34,600 --> 01:17:38,105
<i>Sanjay has promised us the
Maharaja's banquet.</i>

782
01:17:38,105 --> 01:17:43,630
<i>His speciality being lamb
smoked with cloves and cinnamon.</i>

783
01:17:43,630 --> 01:17:49,770
<i>A taste that promises to melt
our hearts and light our fire.</i>

784
01:17:50,158 --> 01:17:53,803
<i>- Hold me back!
- Hold me back!</i>

785
01:17:54,410 --> 01:17:56,781
<i>And in the orange zone...</i>

786
01:17:57,855 --> 01:18:00,878
<i>The Shah of "The New Taj".</i>

<i>Inspired by the whispering
palaces of Jaipur,</i>

788
01:18:04,333 --> 01:18:08,539
<i>Nina Shah has prepared a wedding
banquet fit for queens.</i>

789
01:18:08,793 --> 01:18:13,720
<i>Will she entice the judges with
the tender baby lamb chops?</i>

790
01:18:13,720 --> 01:18:18,733
<i>So, ladies and gentlemen,
let the battle commence.</i>

791
01:19:13,645 --> 01:19:15,709
That'll never happen, you know.

792
01:19:15,956 --> 01:19:19,325
- The two of you. Not like that.
- Like what, Sanjay?

793
01:19:20,449 --> 01:19:22,341
Come on, her mother will
never allow it.

794
01:19:24,153 --> 01:19:26,480
She won't run away again.
D'you know why?

795
01:19:26,480 --> 01:19:28,806
Because this time she's got
something to stay for.

796
01:19:29,042 --> 01:19:32,273
I won't be too sure about that.
She's not gonna risk it.

797
01:19:32,273 --> 01:19:34,259
She'd lose everything.

798
01:19:34,259 --> 01:19:37,235
D'you really think she wants
to lose her family again?

799
01:19:37,235 --> 01:19:39,080
Even for love?

800
01:19:39,635 --> 01:19:42,112
Chances of that are piss and pooh.

801
01:19:46,259 --> 01:19:49,165
That's lovely.
Fit for a king.

802
01:19:53,055 --> 01:19:55,532
OK, stole the lemon.
Here we go.

803
01:19:59,104 --> 01:20:01,842
<i>20 minutes of cooking time remaining.</i>

804

What?

805
01:20:14,506 --> 01:20:15,900
Kiss me.

806
01:20:20,166 --> 01:20:22,349
We're on national television...

807
01:20:22,655 --> 01:20:24,324
We are.

808
01:20:38,863 --> 01:20:42,320
<i>Hold me back. What's going on
in the orange zone?</i>

809
01:20:42,320 --> 01:20:45,773
<i>She must have forgotten some
very crucial spices.</i>

810
01:20:52,457 --> 01:20:54,300
<i>Oh, dear, there goes another one.</i>

811
01:21:12,402 --> 01:21:13,729
Nina.

812
01:21:19,799 --> 01:21:21,762
She's gone, ma'.

813
01:21:22,226 --> 01:21:24,440
Then why are you still here?

814
01:21:27,261 --> 01:21:29,842
Don't make the same mistake I did.

815
01:21:30,046 --> 01:21:33,480
I loved your dad but I always knew...

816
01:21:34,138 --> 01:21:36,678
in my heart of heart of hearts,

817
01:21:37,628 --> 01:21:39,615
he wasn't the one.

818
01:21:42,339 --> 01:21:43,675
Raj?

819
01:21:46,617 --> 01:21:48,854
Trophies don't matter.

820
01:21:49,205 --> 01:21:52,229
The only thing that matters is love.

821
01:22:00,455 --> 01:22:02,688
Go on, hurry up.

822
01:22:02,937 --> 01:22:05,691
And don't you let that girl
out of your sight again.

823
01:22:56,603 --> 01:23:00,394
<i>Welcome back, girls. I hope
you've got your mangoes.</i>

824
01:23:03,473 --> 01:23:04,632
Oh, hold me back,

825
01:23:04,667 --> 01:23:08,265
<i>that was a narrow escape for
the "Taj" ladies, let me tell you!</i>

826

<i>Right, you've got 30 seconds so let's
get your finishing touches on that.</i>

827
01:23:13,142 --> 01:23:16,350
<i>You don't have to cook the pickles,
you can buy that in a shop. Come on then!</i>

828
01:23:16,350 --> 01:23:19,050
<i>Come on, get going, get going!</i>

829
01:23:19,050 --> 01:23:23,676
<i>Right, you got 10, 9, 8, 7,</i>

<i>Hold me back!</i>

832

<i>All our contestants have
worked hard and</i>

<i>have been very ambitious with their dishes.</i>

834
01:23:38,696 --> 01:23:44,511
<i>"Korma TV" is proud to have Scotland's
top chefs as our judges today.</i>

835
01:23:44,879 --> 01:23:48,371
<i>They take their duties very seriously.</i>

836
01:23:52,394 --> 01:23:55,848
<i>The smells in the studio are divine.</i>

837
01:24:02,106 --> 01:24:06,827
<i>4 contestants, 4 judges and
4 outstanding dishes.</i>

838
01:24:07,464 --> 01:24:11,226
<i>A close call between "The Jewel"
and "The New Taj", let me tell ya.</i>

839
01:24:11,908 --> 01:24:16,175
<i>Nina Shah's mogul menu was
beautifully prepared</i>

840

<i>with each and every one of the delicate
flavours complementing each other perfectly.</i>

841

<i>But Sanjay Kahnna confounded our senses</i>

842

<i>with a meal of sheer technical perfection.</i>

843
01:24:30,052 --> 01:24:34,312
<i>A difficult choice between perfection
and heavenly delight.</i>

844
01:24:34,783 --> 01:24:38,745
<i>But, in true fairytale style,</i>

845
01:24:39,017 --> 01:24:40,691
<i>the heart wins out</i>

846
01:24:40,691 --> 01:24:45,112
<i>and tonight's award goes to the

Kiss me.

848

<i>It must be the garam masala.</i>
