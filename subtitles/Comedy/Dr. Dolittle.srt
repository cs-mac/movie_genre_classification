1
00:03:17,334 --> 00:03:20,565
That's it!
Hundred honors and 90 below.

2
00:03:20,771 --> 00:03:23,262
Nicely done, Strangways.
l have to give it to you.

3
00:03:23,474 --> 00:03:28,411
l must leave you for a few minutes.
Order a round on my chit, professor.

4
00:03:28,679 --> 00:03:31,614
Damn it all! Must you break off
at this time every evening?

5
00:03:31,815 --> 00:03:32,907
Sorry, general.

6
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:36,644
My director is a creature of habit.
l get a call every day at this time.

7
00:03:36,854 --> 00:03:38,788
Hurry back
before the cards get cold.

8
00:03:38,989 --> 00:03:42,322
Twenty minutes.
Don't doctor any hands while l'm away.

9
00:03:44,495 --> 00:03:45,928
Same again.

10
00:03:48,632 --> 00:03:50,566
Bless you, master.

11
00:04:05,516 --> 00:04:07,006
Hurry, man!

12
00:04:07,217 --> 00:04:09,242
Get away quick!

13
00:04:27,871 --> 00:04:31,500
W6N, W6N, W6N...

14
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:34,176
...calling G 7W.

15
00:04:34,378 --> 00:04:36,346
How do you hear me? Over.

16
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:41,144
G 7W, London, G 7W, London,
Receiving you, Over,

17
00:04:42,486 --> 00:04:44,078
Stand by to transmit.

18
00:04:44,288 --> 00:04:45,949
Wait. Out.

19
00:05:08,078 --> 00:05:09,602
Here.

20
00:05:34,871 --> 00:05:38,898
Hello, W6N, report my signals.
Over.

21
00:05:40,377 --> 00:05:42,868
Hello, W6N. Over.

22
00:05:47,951 --> 00:05:50,044
Foreman of Signals. Urgent.

23
00:05:55,792 --> 00:05:58,158
Right. Get me
Ml6 radio security control.

24
00:05:59,229 --> 00:06:00,628
What is it?

25
00:06:00,831 --> 00:06:05,734
-Kingston, Jamaica broke contact.
-Broken or faded?

26
00:06:05,936 --> 00:06:08,370
Broken. Carrier wave
is still established.

27
00:06:08,572 --> 00:06:12,474
-Did you check both frequencies?
-Yes, sir. No joy on either.

28
00:06:12,676 --> 00:06:14,940
Keep trying. Let me know
when they come up again.

29
00:06:15,145 --> 00:06:19,946
Hello? Hello, W6N,
report my signals. Over.

30
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:24,143
Foreman of Signals, sir.
Jamaica's broken off mid-transmission.

31
00:06:24,354 --> 00:06:26,652
No, sir, it's not a technical fault.

32
00:06:26,857 --> 00:06:28,449
Yes, sir.

33
00:06:28,659 --> 00:06:31,628
Will you tell him, sir?
Very good.

34
00:06:38,368 --> 00:06:41,895
-Excuse me, are you a member?
-No, l'm looking for Mr. James Bond.

35
00:06:42,072 --> 00:06:46,008
-What name should l say, sir?
-Just give him my card, will you?

36
00:06:46,176 --> 00:06:48,872
Would you like to leave your coat
over there, sir?

37
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:35,488
The house will cover the difference?

38
00:07:48,338 --> 00:07:49,771
l need another thousand.

39
00:07:50,307 --> 00:07:52,332
l admire your courage, Miss....

40
00:07:52,542 --> 00:07:55,841
Trench. Sylvia Trench.

41
00:07:56,046 --> 00:07:58,241
l admire your luck, Mr....

42
00:07:59,249 --> 00:08:00,614
Bond.

43
00:08:01,718 --> 00:08:02,707
James Bond.

44
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:07,117
Mr. Bond, would you
care to raise the limit?

45
00:08:07,491 --> 00:08:09,152
l have no objections.

46
00:08:13,163 --> 00:08:14,596
Now.

47
00:08:19,636 --> 00:08:23,834
-Looks like you're out to get me.
-lt's an idea, at that.

48
00:08:24,641 --> 00:08:25,869
Eight.

49
00:08:30,614 --> 00:08:33,139
-Excuse me, sir.
-Thank you.

50
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,377
Andre, l must pass the shoe.

51
00:08:36,086 --> 00:08:39,886
l hope you'll forgive me,
but it's most important. Thank you.

52
00:08:44,427 --> 00:08:46,793
Have those changed, will you?

53
00:08:50,967 --> 00:08:55,233
Too bad you have to go, just as
things were getting interesting.

54
00:08:55,438 --> 00:08:59,704
Yes. Tell me, Miss Trench,
do you play any other games?

55
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:02,276
l mean besides chemin de fer?

56
00:09:02,479 --> 00:09:06,006
Golf, amongst other things.

57
00:09:06,716 --> 00:09:09,583
-Tomorrow afternoon, then.
-Tomorrow?

58
00:09:09,786 --> 00:09:13,654
We could have dinner afterwards,
perhaps?

59
00:09:13,857 --> 00:09:15,586
Sounds tempting.

60
00:09:16,693 --> 00:09:20,288
May l let you know
in the morning?

61
00:09:20,497 --> 00:09:22,021
Splendid.

62
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:25,396
My number's on the card.

63
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:44,817
See if he's there, will you?

64
00:09:46,857 --> 00:09:51,624
James, where on earth have you been?
l've been searching London for you!

65
00:09:52,696 --> 00:09:55,096
00 7 is here, sir.

66
00:09:55,298 --> 00:09:57,027
He'll see you in a minute.

67
00:09:57,234 --> 00:09:59,395
Moneypenny!

68
00:09:59,603 --> 00:10:01,036
-What gives?
-Me.

69
00:10:01,204 --> 00:10:03,729
Given an ounce of encouragement.

70
00:10:04,241 --> 00:10:07,472
You never take me to dinner
looking like this, James.

71
00:10:07,677 --> 00:10:09,838
You never take me to dinner, period.

72
00:10:10,046 --> 00:10:12,810
l would, only M
would have me court-martialed...

73
00:10:13,016 --> 00:10:16,281
...for illegal use
of government property.

74
00:10:16,486 --> 00:10:21,389
Flattery will get you nowhere,
but don't stop trying. Now.

75
00:10:21,591 --> 00:10:25,322
-What's all this to-do about?
-Strangways. lt looks serious.

76
00:10:25,528 --> 00:10:28,986
We've been burning the air between
here and Jamaica for three hours.

77
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:30,891
ln you go.

78
00:10:31,601 --> 00:10:33,398
Don't forget to write.

79
00:10:48,184 --> 00:10:50,049
Good evening, sir.

80
00:10:50,253 --> 00:10:54,553
lt happens to be 3 a.m.
When do you sleep, 00 7?

81
00:10:54,925 --> 00:10:57,120
Never on the firm's time, sir.

82
00:10:57,327 --> 00:10:58,885
Sit down.

83
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,291
Jamaica went off the air tonight.

84
00:11:05,502 --> 00:11:08,596
Right in the middle
of the opening procedure.

85
00:11:08,805 --> 00:11:11,330
Strangways has disappeared.

86
00:11:11,541 --> 00:11:14,908
So has his secretary. She was new.
We had just sent her there.

87
00:11:15,111 --> 00:11:17,978
Was Strangways on
something special?

88
00:11:18,181 --> 00:11:20,877
He was checking an inquiry
from the Americans.

89
00:11:21,084 --> 00:11:25,350
They had complaints about interference
with their Cape Canaveral rockets.

90
00:11:25,555 --> 00:11:28,251
They think it comes
from the Jamaica area.

91
00:11:29,426 --> 00:11:33,021
-Does "toppling" mean anything to you?
-A little.

92
00:11:33,229 --> 00:11:36,995
lt's throwing the gyroscopic controls
of a guided missile off balance...

93
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,065
...with a radio beam?

94
00:11:39,269 --> 00:11:40,634
More or less.

95
00:11:40,837 --> 00:11:44,398
Five million dollars worth of missile
aimed at a spot in the south Atlantic...

96
00:11:44,607 --> 00:11:48,771
...but finishing up in the middle
of the Brazilian jungle is bad enough.

97
00:11:48,979 --> 00:11:52,506
Now they're going to try orbiting
a rocket around the moon.

98
00:11:52,716 --> 00:11:56,948
The American ClA sent a man
to work with Strangways.

99
00:11:57,153 --> 00:11:59,417
Fellow by the name of Leiter.
Do you know him?

100
00:11:59,656 --> 00:12:01,521
l've heard of him
but never met him.

101
00:12:01,691 --> 00:12:04,524
Has he found out
anything important?

102
00:12:04,728 --> 00:12:07,663
Ask him. You're booked
on the 7:00 plane to Kingston.

103
00:12:07,864 --> 00:12:11,698
That gives you exactly
three hours, 22 minutes.

104
00:12:12,969 --> 00:12:14,732
Armorer.

105
00:12:14,938 --> 00:12:17,930
l'll have background papers
sent to you at the airport...

106
00:12:18,141 --> 00:12:20,200
...in a self-destructor bag.

107
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:23,208
You can study them
during the flight.

108
00:12:23,413 --> 00:12:26,246
l want to know what's happened
to Strangways.

109
00:12:30,553 --> 00:12:32,521
Take off your jacket.

110
00:12:38,128 --> 00:12:40,221
Give me your gun.

111
00:12:43,633 --> 00:12:47,364
l thought so. Damned Beretta again.
l've told you about this before.

112
00:12:48,271 --> 00:12:51,138
You tell him,
for the last time.

113
00:12:52,242 --> 00:12:55,905
lt's nice and light,
in a lady's handbag.

114
00:12:56,246 --> 00:12:57,543
No stopping power.

115
00:12:57,747 --> 00:12:59,806
Any comments, 00 7?

116
00:13:00,884 --> 00:13:02,681
l disagree, sir.

117
00:13:02,886 --> 00:13:06,617
l've used a Beretta for 1 0 years.
l've never missed with it yet.

118
00:13:06,823 --> 00:13:10,816
No, but it jammed on your last job.
You spent six months in hospital.

119
00:13:11,027 --> 00:13:15,157
You carry a double-0 number. lt gives
you a license to kill, not get killed.

120
00:13:15,365 --> 00:13:20,200
Since l've been head of Ml6, there's
been a 40 percent drop in casualties.

121
00:13:20,403 --> 00:13:21,961
l want it to stay that way.

122
00:13:22,772 --> 00:13:24,399
You'll carry the Walther...

123
00:13:25,241 --> 00:13:28,677
...unless you prefer to go back
to standard intelligence duties.

124
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:32,348
No, sir, l would not.

125
00:13:32,549 --> 00:13:35,518
Then from now on you carry
a different gun. Show him.

126
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,678
Walther PPK.

127
00:13:38,888 --> 00:13:43,689
lt's 7.65 mil, with a delivery like
a brick through a plate-glass window.

128
00:13:43,893 --> 00:13:47,693
Takes a Brausch silencer with very
little reduction in muzzle velocity.

129
00:13:47,897 --> 00:13:51,025
-The American ClA swear by them.
-Thank you, Major Boothroyd.

130
00:13:51,234 --> 00:13:52,997
Thank you, sir.
Good night, sir.

131
00:13:53,203 --> 00:13:55,296
-Any questions, 00 7?
-No, sir.

132
00:13:55,505 --> 00:13:57,200
All right. Best of luck.

133
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:59,264
Thank you, sir.

134
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,573
-00 7?
-Sir?

135
00:14:05,748 --> 00:14:07,545
Just leave the Beretta.

136
00:14:26,369 --> 00:14:30,703
Miss Moneypenny, forget the usual
repartee, 007's in a hurry,

137
00:14:42,852 --> 00:14:44,012
Good luck.

138
00:15:24,994 --> 00:15:28,157
There! You made me miss it.

139
00:15:28,364 --> 00:15:30,229
You don't miss a thing.

140
00:15:30,433 --> 00:15:32,867
How did you get in?
Never mind. You're here.

141
00:15:33,069 --> 00:15:35,435
l decided to accept your invitation.

142
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:40,236
That was for tomorrow afternoon.

143
00:15:40,443 --> 00:15:45,073
-Do you always dress this way for golf?
-l changed into something comfortable.

144
00:15:45,815 --> 00:15:47,476
l hope l did the right thing.

145
00:15:48,084 --> 00:15:51,110
You did the right thing,
but you picked the wrong moment.

146
00:15:51,688 --> 00:15:53,087
l have to leave immediately.

147
00:15:53,289 --> 00:15:55,519
Oh, that's too bad.

148
00:15:56,659 --> 00:15:59,628
Just as things
were getting interesting again.

149
00:16:05,168 --> 00:16:07,602
When did you say
you had to leave?

150
00:16:08,838 --> 00:16:10,396
lmmediately.

151
00:16:13,476 --> 00:16:15,307
Almost immediately.

152
00:16:26,322 --> 00:16:29,917
Hello, New York. Your Pan Am 323
just landed in Kingston, Jamaica.

153
00:16:57,553 --> 00:16:59,316
-Taxi!
-Taxi!

154
00:16:59,555 --> 00:17:01,386
All right, go ahead.

155
00:17:01,557 --> 00:17:02,785
Help yourself.

156
00:17:04,027 --> 00:17:07,155
-Taxi!
-Mr. Bond, sir?

157
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:08,888
Yes?

158
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:12,500
l'm Mr. Jones.
Chauffeur from Government House.

159
00:17:12,702 --> 00:17:17,799
Fine, we'll drop my bags at the hotel.
l want to check my reservation.

160
00:17:17,974 --> 00:17:22,138
-l can do that.
-No. You just take care of the bags.

161
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:42,789
-Government House?
-Yes,

162
00:17:42,999 --> 00:17:46,400
-Principal secretary, please.
-Hold the line, please,

163
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:53,867
-Who wants him?
-James Bond. Universal Exports.

164
00:17:54,077 --> 00:17:56,568
Welcome to Jamaica, Mr. Bond.

165
00:17:56,779 --> 00:17:59,304
Yes, your head office alerted us
this morning.

166
00:17:59,549 --> 00:18:02,882
-Free for lunch today? One o'clock?
-That'll suit me fine.

167
00:18:03,052 --> 00:18:05,077
By the way, have you
sent a car for me?

168
00:18:05,288 --> 00:18:07,779
l didn't think you wanted
an official reception,

169
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:10,185
Quite right. One o'clock then.

170
00:18:10,393 --> 00:18:14,193
Forgive me if l'm a few minutes late.

171
00:18:32,315 --> 00:18:35,842
-Where to first, sir?
-Government House, but no hurry.

172
00:18:36,052 --> 00:18:39,180
Just take me for a ride.

173
00:19:08,518 --> 00:19:12,147
You always drive this fast?
l told you l wasn't in a hurry.

174
00:19:12,355 --> 00:19:16,587
Sorry, sir, but l think there's
some fellow trying to follow us.

175
00:19:20,296 --> 00:19:23,788
Then l suggest
you try and lose them.

176
00:19:42,752 --> 00:19:44,743
Take the next right turn.

177
00:20:02,672 --> 00:20:07,166
Now, Mr. Jones, talk fast
before your friend doubles back.

178
00:20:07,376 --> 00:20:09,674
Who are you working for?

179
00:20:09,879 --> 00:20:14,475
l don't know what you're saying.
l was sent to meet you at the airport.

180
00:20:14,684 --> 00:20:16,242
By whom?

181
00:20:16,452 --> 00:20:19,216
By Government House.

182
00:20:19,422 --> 00:20:20,616
l don't think so.

183
00:20:20,823 --> 00:20:23,849
Both hands on the wheel!
l'm a nervous passenger.

184
00:20:25,995 --> 00:20:28,361
Get out. Move!

185
00:20:28,564 --> 00:20:30,725
Keep your hands
where l can see them.

186
00:20:55,892 --> 00:20:57,416
Get up!

187
00:21:10,072 --> 00:21:12,131
-Now talk.
-All right.

188
00:21:16,546 --> 00:21:18,844
Let me have a cigarette.

189
00:21:32,562 --> 00:21:35,053
To hell with you!

190
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,852
Sergeant, make sure
he doesn't get away.

191
00:22:06,562 --> 00:22:08,120
Cyanide in a cigarette?

192
00:22:08,331 --> 00:22:10,799
-Fantastic.
-No less.

193
00:22:10,967 --> 00:22:14,733
-Well, Duff, what have you got?
-The car was stolen.

194
00:22:14,937 --> 00:22:17,838
We haven't identified the driver yet.

195
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:20,008
But he wasn't a Kingston man.

196
00:22:20,209 --> 00:22:23,042
Wherever he was from,
news of my arrival leaked.

197
00:22:23,245 --> 00:22:25,509
We didn't advertise it,
l can assure you.

198
00:22:25,715 --> 00:22:27,273
Perhaps not.

199
00:22:27,483 --> 00:22:30,452
lt seemed someone
had been selling tickets.

200
00:22:30,753 --> 00:22:32,550
Anything more we can do for you?

201
00:22:33,155 --> 00:22:35,749
l'd like to meet
the last people to see Strangways.

202
00:22:35,958 --> 00:22:39,519
Nobody saw him after he left
our bridge four at the Queens Club.

203
00:22:39,729 --> 00:22:41,594
-Who were the others?
-Professor Dent.

204
00:22:41,764 --> 00:22:45,495
Metallurgist. Runs a test laboratory.
Respected. Clean bill.

205
00:22:45,701 --> 00:22:49,535
-Potter.
-General, ex-army. Been here ages.

206
00:22:49,739 --> 00:22:51,138
Start with those.

207
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:54,605
-Want them brought in?
-Lord, no! l'll meet them socially.

208
00:22:54,777 --> 00:22:56,574
l'll introduce you
at the club tonight.

209
00:22:56,779 --> 00:22:59,714
Fine. l'd like to take a look
at Strangways' place.

210
00:22:59,949 --> 00:23:02,247
l'll run you up there now.

211
00:23:14,497 --> 00:23:15,691
Go on in.

212
00:23:21,837 --> 00:23:24,135
Oh, yes, that's a blood patch.

213
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:28,436
-They've grouped it as O-Rh positive.
-That's her group, all right.

214
00:23:38,788 --> 00:23:41,655
The set was still switched on
when we came round.

215
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:44,816
We tried to get through on
that frequency, but it was dead.

216
00:23:44,994 --> 00:23:49,761
And it'll stay dead. All frequencies
are changed when security's broken.

217
00:23:57,540 --> 00:24:00,270
Receipt from Dent Laboratories.

218
00:24:01,043 --> 00:24:02,840
Geology a hobby of Strangways'?

219
00:24:03,479 --> 00:24:05,379
Not that l know of, no.

220
00:24:11,854 --> 00:24:13,981
Who is the man with Strangways?

221
00:24:16,859 --> 00:24:18,417
One of the local fishermen.

222
00:24:18,627 --> 00:24:23,360
-He drove the car that tailed me.
-That so? That gives us something.

223
00:24:23,566 --> 00:24:26,262
-l'll have a check made on him.
-You do that.

224
00:24:26,469 --> 00:24:30,030
l want to have a bath before
l meet Pleydell-Smith at the club.

225
00:24:36,345 --> 00:24:40,805
One medium-dry vodka martini,
mixed like you said, sir, not stirred.

226
00:24:41,016 --> 00:24:42,847
-Anything else?
-No, that's all.

227
00:24:43,052 --> 00:24:44,314
Very well, sir.

228
00:26:02,631 --> 00:26:06,362
Curious, old Strangways
just vanishing like that. Or is it?

229
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:11,128
His secretary was very nice,
very nice indeed.

230
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:14,571
-Did you know her?
-l'd seen her around, you know.

231
00:26:15,444 --> 00:26:18,379
l suppose none of you could throw
any light on what happened?

232
00:26:18,581 --> 00:26:20,515
His conversation? Any hint?

233
00:26:21,884 --> 00:26:25,376
l never heard him talk about anything
but big-game fishing and bridge.

234
00:26:25,588 --> 00:26:30,525
He started fishing three weeks ago
and was out practically every day.

235
00:26:30,926 --> 00:26:34,726
Must've cost him something. These
fishermen ask the Earth to charter.

236
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:38,127
-And Quarrel's the most expensive.
-Quarrel?

237
00:26:38,334 --> 00:26:40,632
Cayman lslander.
Keeps a boat in the harbor.

238
00:26:40,836 --> 00:26:42,201
l see.

239
00:26:52,448 --> 00:26:55,440
-Excuse me. Where do l find Quarrel?
-Him.

240
00:26:56,151 --> 00:26:57,209
Thank you.

241
00:27:07,496 --> 00:27:09,464
Your name Quarrel?

242
00:27:10,432 --> 00:27:11,729
Maybe.

243
00:27:11,934 --> 00:27:15,961
l'm a friend
of Commander Strangways.

244
00:27:18,073 --> 00:27:22,339
Ain't that nice!
l like people who's friends of people.

245
00:27:22,544 --> 00:27:25,809
l thought you might be able to tell me
what happened to him.

246
00:27:27,449 --> 00:27:29,940
As far as l know, nothing happened.

247
00:27:30,152 --> 00:27:32,950
Unless you know different, captain.

248
00:27:33,923 --> 00:27:37,381
Where did you take him
in your boat?

249
00:27:37,593 --> 00:27:38,924
See that?

250
00:27:39,495 --> 00:27:42,055
That there's the Caribbean.

251
00:27:42,264 --> 00:27:44,892
That's where. Fishing.

252
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:48,900
l'm interested in fishing.
l'd like to charter your boat.

253
00:27:49,104 --> 00:27:51,163
l'm sorry. lt's not for hire.

254
00:27:51,373 --> 00:27:55,434
-Seems l came to the wrong address.
-That's all right.

255
00:27:55,644 --> 00:27:59,444
Now if you'll excuse me,
l've got business to attend to.

256
00:28:32,414 --> 00:28:33,711
Hey, Puss Feller.

257
00:28:54,603 --> 00:28:59,097
Well, if it ain't my friend
what gets addresses mixed.

258
00:28:59,308 --> 00:29:01,799
You got the right one now
if you like good eating.

259
00:29:02,011 --> 00:29:05,344
l do if the conversation matches it.

260
00:29:05,881 --> 00:29:08,441
Back at the boat, too public.

261
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:11,676
-ln there, it different.
-After you.

262
00:29:12,755 --> 00:29:14,552
Sure thing.

263
00:29:19,595 --> 00:29:22,189
-See we get a bit of privacy.
-Nothing but.

264
00:29:22,364 --> 00:29:23,524
Nothing but.

265
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:33,438
-Pick a seat.
-l'm fine.

266
00:29:34,877 --> 00:29:39,405
Okay, mister, supposing you start
the conversation. How's about it?

267
00:29:49,992 --> 00:29:53,928
Ain't no use struggling.
Puss Feller wrestles alligators.

268
00:30:01,370 --> 00:30:04,032
Right! Up slowly
and face that wall.

269
00:30:13,582 --> 00:30:15,243
Hold it.

270
00:30:20,422 --> 00:30:23,983
Gently, gently.
Let's not get excited.

271
00:30:28,697 --> 00:30:29,686
Frisk him.

272
00:30:43,045 --> 00:30:44,239
Nothing.

273
00:30:46,115 --> 00:30:49,016
lnteresting.
Where were you measured for this?

274
00:30:49,218 --> 00:30:51,049
My tailor. Savile Row.

275
00:30:51,253 --> 00:30:54,484
That so?
Mine's a guy in Washington.

276
00:30:54,690 --> 00:30:57,682
Felix Leiter,
Central lntelligence Agency.

277
00:30:57,893 --> 00:31:00,361
You must be James Bond.

278
00:31:00,529 --> 00:31:02,019
You mean we're fighting
the same war?

279
00:31:02,197 --> 00:31:04,256
l spotted you at the airport.

280
00:31:04,433 --> 00:31:08,563
When l saw you drive off with the
opposition, l figured l must be wrong.

281
00:31:08,737 --> 00:31:10,170
Quarrel's been helping me.

282
00:31:10,372 --> 00:31:13,739
-No hard feelings, l hope.
-Only a sore hand. Glad to know you.

283
00:31:13,942 --> 00:31:15,773
That's Puss Feller.
He owns the place.

284
00:31:15,978 --> 00:31:18,344
-Hope he cooks better than he fights.
-You could find out.

285
00:31:18,514 --> 00:31:20,345
Nobody died from my cooking yet.

286
00:31:58,053 --> 00:32:00,749
There you are.
Cape Canaveral is screaming.

287
00:32:00,956 --> 00:32:04,392
They don't want anything to go wrong
with this moon-rocket launching.

288
00:32:04,593 --> 00:32:08,085
You say Strangways didn't think the
interference was coming from here.

289
00:32:08,297 --> 00:32:12,996
-l suppose you cased the joint.
-l checked unofficially.

290
00:32:13,202 --> 00:32:16,433
You limeys can be pretty touchy
about trespassing.

291
00:32:16,638 --> 00:32:18,936
Strangways and Quarrel
checked the offshore islands.

292
00:32:19,107 --> 00:32:20,904
-You found nothing?
-Not a thing.

293
00:32:21,109 --> 00:32:24,340
-Where did you look?
-Just about most everywhere.

294
00:32:24,546 --> 00:32:28,414
-Fire lsland, Crab Key, Morgan's Reef.
-Checked them all thoroughly?

295
00:32:28,617 --> 00:32:31,017
Except Crab Key.
We have no right to go there.

296
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:34,387
-Why not?
-lt belongs to a Chinese--

297
00:32:36,892 --> 00:32:39,725
Get her, Quarrel,
and the camera.

298
00:32:43,832 --> 00:32:45,231
Evening, missus.

299
00:32:47,970 --> 00:32:49,198
You're hurting!

300
00:32:49,871 --> 00:32:52,237
Captain wants you
to have a drink with us.

301
00:32:53,909 --> 00:32:57,743
-You're hurting me.
-You can't mean it.

302
00:33:06,221 --> 00:33:07,620
Good evening.

303
00:33:13,262 --> 00:33:15,162
Why do you want
another picture of me?

304
00:33:15,364 --> 00:33:19,460
l only got your hat at the airport.
Tell this ape to let me go.

305
00:33:19,668 --> 00:33:21,533
Why do you want a picture?

306
00:33:21,737 --> 00:33:26,037
-That's the way l earn my living.
-Who pays you?

307
00:33:27,876 --> 00:33:29,867
The Daily Gleaner,

308
00:33:35,317 --> 00:33:37,581
-Anything l can do?
-Ever seen this girl before?

309
00:33:38,487 --> 00:33:41,888
She comes here sometimes.
She being a nuisance to you?

310
00:33:42,057 --> 00:33:43,490
You want me to get rid of her?

311
00:33:43,659 --> 00:33:48,119
No. Ring the Gleaner and find out if
they sent a photographer here tonight.

312
00:33:49,364 --> 00:33:51,355
They didn't send me.
l work freelance.

313
00:33:51,566 --> 00:33:54,091
Freelance? For whom?

314
00:33:54,303 --> 00:33:55,668
You--

315
00:33:57,706 --> 00:33:59,901
Tell us and he'll stop.

316
00:34:06,615 --> 00:34:09,379
We don't get nothing out of her.
Want me to break her arm?

317
00:34:11,186 --> 00:34:12,744
Another time.

318
00:34:17,426 --> 00:34:20,623
The second time nothing's come out.
Give her her arm back.

319
00:34:21,863 --> 00:34:24,093
Run along, freelance.

320
00:34:24,299 --> 00:34:28,167
You'll be sorry!
You'll all be sorry, you rats!

321
00:34:32,607 --> 00:34:35,269
One takes cyanide, another
would have let her arm be broken.

322
00:34:35,477 --> 00:34:39,345
Neither would talk. Who puts
that sort of scare into people?

323
00:34:39,548 --> 00:34:42,517
We better find out but fast.

324
00:34:42,718 --> 00:34:45,346
What's so special about Crab Key?
Why can't we go?

325
00:34:45,554 --> 00:34:49,650
lt belongs to a Chinese character.
He won't allow anyone to land.

326
00:34:49,858 --> 00:34:52,725
l had our naval reconnaissance planes
take a look.

327
00:34:52,928 --> 00:34:55,089
They found nothing
but a bauxite mine...

328
00:34:55,263 --> 00:34:57,561
...low-scan C-H radar setup.

329
00:34:57,733 --> 00:34:59,325
But there's nothing
illegal about that.

330
00:34:59,501 --> 00:35:02,527
That Crab Key scares me plenty.

331
00:35:02,738 --> 00:35:05,605
Friends of mine went there
after seashells.

332
00:35:05,807 --> 00:35:08,071
Only trouble,
they never came back again.

333
00:35:08,276 --> 00:35:10,676
None of the local fishermen
will go there.

334
00:35:10,879 --> 00:35:13,074
Commander Strangways and me
slipped in at night.

335
00:35:13,281 --> 00:35:16,876
He take samples and we came back.
Don't do to hang about there.

336
00:35:17,085 --> 00:35:22,113
-What kind of samples?
-Bits of rock, sand, water.

337
00:35:23,492 --> 00:35:27,952
l see. Crab Key
begins to interest me.

338
00:35:28,163 --> 00:35:30,631
What else do we know
about this Chinese gentleman?

339
00:35:30,832 --> 00:35:35,201
Nothing much, except his name.
Dr. No.

340
00:36:10,639 --> 00:36:14,166
-l'd like to see Professor Dent.
-Have you an appointment, sir?

341
00:36:14,376 --> 00:36:16,844
Tell him it's James Bond.
We met yesterday.

342
00:36:17,045 --> 00:36:19,570
Very well.
He's somewhere in the lab.

343
00:36:20,649 --> 00:36:22,674
ls Professor Dent there?

344
00:36:25,287 --> 00:36:26,845
Never mind.

345
00:36:27,823 --> 00:36:29,290
Good morning, professor.

346
00:36:30,192 --> 00:36:32,626
Mr. Bond.
Anything l can do for you?

347
00:36:32,828 --> 00:36:37,765
Yes, l came across this in
Strangways' office. Your receipt.

348
00:36:39,167 --> 00:36:43,069
-Yes, that's right.
-Can you tell me anything about it?

349
00:36:44,239 --> 00:36:48,733
Poor old Strangways. Bit of a bug
of his, this amateur geology.

350
00:36:48,944 --> 00:36:52,846
He brought rock samples in for testing,
convinced they were valuable.

351
00:36:53,014 --> 00:36:54,379
Were they?

352
00:36:55,050 --> 00:36:58,110
No, of course not.
Just low-grade iron pyrites.

353
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,117
Can l see them?

354
00:37:00,322 --> 00:37:02,654
No, l threw them away.

355
00:37:04,292 --> 00:37:07,523
-Do you know where he found them?
-No, he didn't say.

356
00:37:08,663 --> 00:37:11,632
-Crab Key, perhaps?
-Definitely not.

357
00:37:12,767 --> 00:37:14,701
Why so certain?

358
00:37:14,903 --> 00:37:16,894
Not geologically possible.

359
00:37:17,105 --> 00:37:20,666
Thank you very much. lt's kind
of you to spare me your time.

360
00:37:20,876 --> 00:37:22,844
You're very welcome, Mr. Bond.

361
00:37:23,044 --> 00:37:24,409
Professor?

362
00:37:27,749 --> 00:37:29,307
Allow me.

363
00:37:33,288 --> 00:37:34,687
Morning.

364
00:37:54,509 --> 00:37:57,569
-l've got to get to Crab Key.
-You know the procedure.

365
00:37:57,779 --> 00:38:00,373
There's no time for that.
l'll take responsibility.

366
00:38:00,582 --> 00:38:04,177
-l hope you know what you're doing.
-Come on!

367
00:38:48,096 --> 00:38:51,657
-l radioed. They're expecting me.
-Go ahead.

368
00:39:36,611 --> 00:39:38,545
Sit down,

369
00:39:46,421 --> 00:39:50,687
Why have you disobeyed my
strictest rule and come in daylight?

370
00:39:50,892 --> 00:39:54,123
l had to.
Bond came to see me this morning.

371
00:39:54,329 --> 00:39:59,096
l know, l gave orders that he should
be killed, Why is he still alive?

372
00:40:00,435 --> 00:40:02,096
Our attempts failed.

373
00:40:02,303 --> 00:40:05,704
Your attempts failed,
l do not like failure,

374
00:40:05,907 --> 00:40:08,398
You are not going to fail me again,
professor?

375
00:40:08,610 --> 00:40:11,579
No. l came to warn you.

376
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:13,338
Warn me?

377
00:40:13,548 --> 00:40:15,175
Tell you.

378
00:40:15,383 --> 00:40:19,012
Bond discovered those rock samples
of Strangways' came from Crab Key.

379
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:21,518
He's not a fool.
He's sure to come out here.

380
00:40:21,723 --> 00:40:25,591
l hope not, lf he does,
l shall hold you responsible,

381
00:40:25,794 --> 00:40:27,955
l make myself clear?

382
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:31,021
Yes, quite clear.

383
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,698
Go to the table,

384
00:40:46,815 --> 00:40:49,545
You see what is in the cage?

385
00:40:51,186 --> 00:40:53,086
Pick it up,

386
00:40:54,989 --> 00:40:56,616
Pick it up,

387
00:41:04,999 --> 00:41:06,489
Tonight,

388
00:41:22,417 --> 00:41:25,181
-l'd like to send a cable.
-Yes, of course.

389
00:41:26,221 --> 00:41:29,657
The car you ordered,
it's been delivered.

390
00:41:29,858 --> 00:41:31,917
lt's in number five parking lot.

391
00:41:32,994 --> 00:41:36,430
-Thank you. Good night.
-Good night, Mr. Bond.

392
00:44:39,814 --> 00:44:41,611
-Morning, Pleydell-Smith.
-Morning, Bond.

393
00:44:41,816 --> 00:44:44,307
Sorry to trouble you,
but l need some information.

394
00:44:44,519 --> 00:44:47,488
All you have
on Dr. No and Crab Key.

395
00:44:47,689 --> 00:44:49,850
Miss Taro,
bring me the files on Dr. No.

396
00:44:50,058 --> 00:44:53,459
-Sit down.
-What do you know about the island?

397
00:44:53,628 --> 00:44:55,755
Not much, except there's
a bauxite mine there.

398
00:44:55,930 --> 00:44:58,797
Dr. No runs it
like a concentration camp.

399
00:44:59,033 --> 00:45:02,400
l've heard funny rumors, but no one's
ever complained officially.

400
00:45:03,738 --> 00:45:05,603
Miss Taro, just leave them here.

401
00:45:05,807 --> 00:45:08,640
l'm very sorry,
but we can't find them anywhere.

402
00:45:08,843 --> 00:45:10,401
What do you mean?
Who had them last?

403
00:45:10,645 --> 00:45:13,705
Commander Strangways. Both files.

404
00:45:13,881 --> 00:45:15,781
All right, Miss Taro.

405
00:45:17,285 --> 00:45:19,913
Damn nuisance,
their disappearing like that.

406
00:45:20,121 --> 00:45:21,452
On the contrary.

407
00:45:22,690 --> 00:45:25,591
l'd have been surprised
if they hadn't .

408
00:45:25,793 --> 00:45:30,730
That came for you from London
in the plane, in the diplomatic pouch.

409
00:45:35,803 --> 00:45:37,634
Present from home.

410
00:45:41,676 --> 00:45:43,769
Can l get out that way?

411
00:45:57,225 --> 00:46:00,888
That's a naughty little habit.
Listening at keyholes?

412
00:46:01,129 --> 00:46:04,189
l wasn't listening.
l was looking for those files.

413
00:46:04,365 --> 00:46:06,856
Anything that can't be found,
l get the blame.

414
00:46:07,068 --> 00:46:10,697
Forget it. l'm sure it's not
very important anyhow.

415
00:46:10,905 --> 00:46:14,170
l'd hate to think you'll spend
the afternoon looking for them.

416
00:46:14,375 --> 00:46:16,639
No. l have the afternoon off.

417
00:46:16,844 --> 00:46:20,473
There's a coincidence. So have l.
Why not show me around the island?

418
00:46:21,516 --> 00:46:24,815
What should l say to an invitation
from a strange gentleman?

419
00:46:25,019 --> 00:46:26,509
You should say yes.

420
00:46:27,021 --> 00:46:28,511
l should say maybe.

421
00:46:29,624 --> 00:46:32,115
Three o'clock at my hotel, maybe?

422
00:46:34,162 --> 00:46:35,891
Yes, maybe.

423
00:46:36,097 --> 00:46:37,496
Good.

424
00:46:48,876 --> 00:46:52,004
The luminous dial activates it.
Hold this.

425
00:46:52,213 --> 00:46:56,172
Where did Commander Strangways
place those samples?

426
00:46:56,384 --> 00:46:58,852
-About where your feet is.
-Good.

427
00:47:05,259 --> 00:47:08,353
Hi there.
Lose something?

428
00:47:08,529 --> 00:47:10,724
Take a look at this Geiger reading.

429
00:47:14,168 --> 00:47:18,662
Those samples Strangways brought
back from Crab Key were radioactive.

430
00:47:18,873 --> 00:47:22,502
Yet Dent told me they were
worthless chunks of iron ore.

431
00:47:22,710 --> 00:47:24,837
He's either a bad professor
or a poor liar.

432
00:47:25,046 --> 00:47:29,244
l intend to find out which.
How soon can you get us to Crab Key?

433
00:47:29,584 --> 00:47:32,314
Well, it's like this, captain.

434
00:47:33,287 --> 00:47:36,415
Commander Strangways, he done
take samples of all the islands.

435
00:47:36,624 --> 00:47:38,592
Supposing we check
the nearest ones first?

436
00:47:38,793 --> 00:47:40,761
No. l'm interested in Crab Key.

437
00:47:40,962 --> 00:47:44,659
l took the commander there,
and we got away without trouble.

438
00:47:44,866 --> 00:47:48,097
lt don't do for a man
to tempt providence too often.

439
00:47:48,302 --> 00:47:49,769
You see, there's a dragon.

440
00:47:49,971 --> 00:47:51,370
What?

441
00:47:51,572 --> 00:47:56,009
Native superstition.
Started by Dr. No, probably.

442
00:47:56,210 --> 00:47:58,110
All right. We don't want to force you.

443
00:47:58,679 --> 00:48:02,410
Leiter and l will go over after dark
if you'll give us directions.

444
00:48:02,617 --> 00:48:05,211
l get my directions from my nose...

445
00:48:05,419 --> 00:48:07,887
...my ears, from my instincts.

446
00:48:10,091 --> 00:48:12,753
Anyway, l'll be here about 7.

447
00:48:14,629 --> 00:48:16,119
Fine.

448
00:48:22,904 --> 00:48:25,532
Mr. Bond, there's
a telephone message for you.

449
00:48:25,740 --> 00:48:29,301
-Johnny, what have you done with it?
-lt's right here.

450
00:48:51,432 --> 00:48:52,797
Hello?

451
00:48:53,234 --> 00:48:56,635
Oh, Mr. Bond. l was thinking.

452
00:48:56,837 --> 00:48:59,829
Why don't you collect me
at my apartment?

453
00:49:00,074 --> 00:49:04,340
lt's lovely up here in the mountains.
Nice and cool.

454
00:49:05,413 --> 00:49:10,248
All right. You leave the
Port Royal Road out of Kingston.

455
00:49:10,451 --> 00:49:15,388
Then along the Wentworth Road
until you get to the cement factory.

456
00:49:15,656 --> 00:49:17,590
Then you turn left.

457
00:49:17,792 --> 00:49:21,626
Follow the road up the hill,
down the other side,,,

458
00:49:21,829 --> 00:49:24,992
,,,and two miles further on,
on the left,,,

459
00:49:25,199 --> 00:49:28,896
,,,Magenta Drive, 239 1,

460
00:49:30,304 --> 00:49:32,465
l'll be waiting for you,

461
00:51:12,673 --> 00:51:14,140
How did it happen?

462
00:51:15,943 --> 00:51:18,503
l think they were on their way
to a funeral.

463
00:51:39,133 --> 00:51:41,192
Just a minute.

464
00:51:51,045 --> 00:51:53,104
You did invite me, remember?

465
00:51:53,314 --> 00:51:58,251
Of course. l just didn't
expect you here so soon.

466
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:01,054
Yes, come in.

467
00:52:05,793 --> 00:52:07,624
l'll go put some clothes on.

468
00:52:07,795 --> 00:52:11,356
Don't go to any trouble
on my account.

469
00:52:12,633 --> 00:52:13,998
Please.

470
00:52:14,201 --> 00:52:17,864
Forgive me. l thought l was
invited up here to admire the view.

471
00:52:22,843 --> 00:52:25,038
l feel one of us should answer it.

472
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:36,988
Hello? Yes, l know.
He's here now.

473
00:52:41,629 --> 00:52:43,529
l don't know what happened.

474
00:52:44,665 --> 00:52:48,533
All right. l'll try and keep him here
for a couple of hours.

475
00:52:48,736 --> 00:52:50,704
All right--
l'll have to go now.

476
00:52:50,905 --> 00:52:53,169
All right. l'll call you later.

477
00:52:57,411 --> 00:53:00,346
You believe in living dangerously.
l can see that.

478
00:53:00,581 --> 00:53:02,344
What do you mean?

479
00:53:02,516 --> 00:53:06,213
Sitting around with wet hair,
you'll die of pneumonia.

480
00:53:09,557 --> 00:53:12,151
-lt is rather beautiful.
-Thank you.

481
00:53:12,359 --> 00:53:14,156
Do you always wear it up?

482
00:53:14,361 --> 00:53:16,261
-Don't you like it that way?
-Very much.

483
00:53:17,331 --> 00:53:21,324
With your sort of face,
it's wonderful.

484
00:53:22,336 --> 00:53:24,770
What's going on behind my back?

485
00:53:24,972 --> 00:53:26,166
Nothing.

486
00:53:27,308 --> 00:53:30,573
Look, no hands.

487
00:53:45,426 --> 00:53:47,986
l'm hungry. Let's go out and eat.

488
00:53:49,096 --> 00:53:50,654
l'll make dinner here.

489
00:53:50,865 --> 00:53:54,699
No. l'm feeling ltalian and musical.

490
00:53:55,102 --> 00:53:56,467
The Blue Mountain Grill.

491
00:53:56,670 --> 00:53:58,535
l'd rather stay here.

492
00:53:58,772 --> 00:54:01,639
lt's more fun alone.

493
00:54:01,809 --> 00:54:04,539
Yes, but l don't want you
getting dishpan hands.

494
00:54:04,745 --> 00:54:06,269
l like cooking.

495
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:09,074
Forget it. May l use your phone?

496
00:54:11,785 --> 00:54:13,616
Who are you ringing?

497
00:54:13,821 --> 00:54:15,550
Taxi.

498
00:54:16,991 --> 00:54:19,482
James Bond here.
Can l have a car sent to....

499
00:54:19,693 --> 00:54:22,526
2 1 7 1 Magenta Drive?

500
00:54:22,730 --> 00:54:25,927
As soon as you can, please.
Thank you.

501
00:54:27,001 --> 00:54:31,028
-l thought you came by car.
-Wouldn't start. Engine trouble.

502
00:54:31,238 --> 00:54:33,433
That explains--

503
00:54:34,542 --> 00:54:36,100
Explains what?

504
00:54:36,310 --> 00:54:38,801
Why you need a taxi.

505
00:54:39,013 --> 00:54:41,243
Why l need a taxi?

506
00:54:41,448 --> 00:54:43,973
Careful, my nail varnish!

507
00:54:54,428 --> 00:54:57,454
-The lights.
-No, l always leave them on.

508
00:55:01,969 --> 00:55:03,834
What's going on?

509
00:55:04,038 --> 00:55:05,767
Forgive me.
Book her, superintendent.

510
00:55:06,106 --> 00:55:07,539
And...

511
00:55:08,409 --> 00:55:10,809
...be careful of her nail varnish.

512
00:57:35,904 --> 00:57:38,065
Drop it, professor!
Behind you.

513
00:57:43,178 --> 00:57:45,646
l thought you'd turn up
sooner or later.

514
00:57:45,847 --> 00:57:47,712
Sit down.

515
00:57:50,252 --> 00:57:53,915
-The girl talked.
-But of course.

516
00:57:54,122 --> 00:57:56,852
l was suspicious
at the Queens Club anyhow...

517
00:57:57,058 --> 00:58:00,550
...when you were the only one who'd
seen Strangways' new secretary.

518
00:58:02,330 --> 00:58:03,991
Then at the lab...

519
00:58:04,499 --> 00:58:07,468
...you didn't mention
that Strangways' samples...

520
00:58:08,370 --> 00:58:09,962
...were radioactive.

521
00:58:10,839 --> 00:58:12,170
Very clever, Mr. Bond.

522
00:58:13,608 --> 00:58:15,405
You're up against
more than you know.

523
00:58:15,610 --> 00:58:17,840
Shoot me, you'll end up
like Strangways.

524
00:58:18,046 --> 00:58:19,411
You killed him?

525
00:58:19,614 --> 00:58:21,707
He was killed,
but never mind how.

526
00:58:22,584 --> 00:58:25,075
Who are you working for?

527
00:58:25,287 --> 00:58:28,950
l'll tell you. You won't live to use
the information. l'm working--

528
00:58:31,559 --> 00:58:34,027
lt's a Smith & Wesson...

529
00:58:34,229 --> 00:58:36,459
...and you've had your six.

530
00:58:53,315 --> 00:58:54,839
Better late than never.

531
00:58:55,050 --> 00:58:58,747
-Everything ready?
-For the last two hours.

532
00:59:00,522 --> 00:59:02,649
Don't worry.
Everything will be fine.

533
00:59:02,857 --> 00:59:04,154
You say so.

534
00:59:04,359 --> 00:59:07,260
Bottom of where my belly
used to be tells me different.

535
00:59:07,462 --> 00:59:10,431
For me, Crab Key's
going to be a gentle relaxation.

536
00:59:10,632 --> 00:59:14,295
-From what? Dames?
-No, from being a clay pigeon.

537
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:47,259
This is as far as we go
with the engine.

538
00:59:47,469 --> 00:59:50,302
Make with paddle and wind
from now on in.

539
00:59:55,377 --> 00:59:59,040
-Let me go with him.
-No. We settled that. lt's my beat.

540
00:59:59,247 --> 01:00:02,114
lt's my head in the noose
if anything gets unstuck.

541
01:00:02,317 --> 01:00:05,309
Canaveral can only wait
48 hours for that moon shot.

542
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:07,818
We'll be back in 1 2.
lf not, it's your beat.

543
01:00:08,022 --> 01:00:10,115
You better bring
your marines with you.

544
01:00:11,192 --> 01:00:13,251
Quarrel, if you see a dragon...

545
01:00:13,461 --> 01:00:15,759
...you get him first
and breathe on him.

546
01:00:15,964 --> 01:00:18,057
With all that rum in you,
he'll die happy.

547
01:00:46,027 --> 01:00:49,622
Better drop the sail
in case their radar's on scan.

548
01:00:58,540 --> 01:01:00,531
Hard about, captain. Now!

549
01:01:29,370 --> 01:01:30,598
Cover it up.

550
01:01:31,940 --> 01:01:34,340
We'd better get some sleep
before it gets light.

551
01:01:34,542 --> 01:01:36,407
l'll be down this end.

552
01:02:54,589 --> 01:02:56,284
Who is that?

553
01:03:02,697 --> 01:03:07,532
lt's all right, l'm not supposed
to be here either. Are you alone?

554
01:03:07,702 --> 01:03:11,263
What are you doing here?
Looking for shells?

555
01:03:11,439 --> 01:03:13,407
No, l'm just looking.

556
01:03:13,608 --> 01:03:15,473
Stay where you are.

557
01:03:16,945 --> 01:03:20,904
-l promise l won't steal your shells.
-l promise you won't either.

558
01:03:22,917 --> 01:03:27,547
-Stay where you are!
-My intentions are strictly honorable.

559
01:03:47,609 --> 01:03:49,941
What's your name?

560
01:03:50,144 --> 01:03:52,476
-Ryder.
-Ryder what?

561
01:03:52,680 --> 01:03:54,705
Honey Ryder.

562
01:03:55,783 --> 01:04:00,550
-What's so funny about it?
-Nothing. lt's a very pretty name.

563
01:04:02,123 --> 01:04:04,284
What's your name?

564
01:04:04,492 --> 01:04:06,357
James.

565
01:04:07,929 --> 01:04:10,864
Tell me, did you use your sail
all the way up to the reef?

566
01:04:11,032 --> 01:04:13,125
Of course. l always do.

567
01:04:13,334 --> 01:04:16,064
Then they'll know we're here.
They have radar.

568
01:04:16,270 --> 01:04:19,034
My boat is too small
to be noticed.

569
01:04:19,240 --> 01:04:21,731
And l often come here
to get shells.

570
01:04:21,943 --> 01:04:24,935
At first they tried to catch me,
but they couldn't .

571
01:04:25,146 --> 01:04:27,080
Now l don't think
they bother anymore.

572
01:04:27,281 --> 01:04:29,613
They will this time.

573
01:04:31,552 --> 01:04:32,712
Don't bother with those!

574
01:04:32,887 --> 01:04:34,980
Don't bother?

575
01:04:35,189 --> 01:04:37,054
Are they valuable?

576
01:04:37,258 --> 01:04:40,091
This one is worth $50 in Miami.

577
01:04:40,294 --> 01:04:41,693
Fifty!

578
01:04:44,732 --> 01:04:47,326
You promise you won't tell anyone?

579
01:04:47,535 --> 01:04:49,196
l promise.

580
01:04:49,404 --> 01:04:52,669
-Come and take a look!
-lt's all right. He's with me.

581
01:04:53,541 --> 01:04:55,475
Captain, what do you think of that?

582
01:04:58,513 --> 01:04:59,775
What's the matter?

583
01:05:04,519 --> 01:05:08,478
That's a high-powered boat.
Take some cover. Come on!

584
01:05:36,617 --> 01:05:38,448
They're here, all right.

585
01:05:38,653 --> 01:05:41,713
Okay, folks.
Come out and you won't get hurt.

586
01:05:43,124 --> 01:05:45,092
Stand up and show yourselves...

587
01:05:45,293 --> 01:05:47,853
...or we'll be forced
to open fire!

588
01:05:50,798 --> 01:05:52,060
Come on out!

589
01:05:52,233 --> 01:05:55,691
We know you're there!
We've been expecting you.

590
01:05:55,903 --> 01:05:58,565
Just walk out with your hands up
and you'll be okay.

591
01:05:59,741 --> 01:06:01,402
This is your last chance.

592
01:06:01,609 --> 01:06:03,543
They're bluffing,
but keep your head down.

593
01:06:04,378 --> 01:06:06,437
All right! You've been warned!

594
01:06:07,115 --> 01:06:09,481
-This is it!
-Lie still.

595
01:06:09,684 --> 01:06:11,777
lt won't last long.
They don't know we're here.

596
01:06:11,953 --> 01:06:13,386
Fire!

597
01:06:27,301 --> 01:06:28,928
You coming out?

598
01:06:29,403 --> 01:06:31,064
All right, then.

599
01:06:31,839 --> 01:06:35,331
We'll be back!
We'll be back with the dogs!

600
01:06:35,877 --> 01:06:36,866
Full speed ahead.

601
01:06:59,967 --> 01:07:01,935
l told you there's
something wrong here.

602
01:07:02,603 --> 01:07:04,571
That was a machine gun,
not a dragon.

603
01:07:04,739 --> 01:07:05,933
There's a dragon here too.

604
01:07:06,107 --> 01:07:08,132
-She's right.
-You've seen it?

605
01:07:08,342 --> 01:07:11,800
Yes, l have.
He had two great, glaring eyes...

606
01:07:11,979 --> 01:07:13,879
...short tail and pointed wings.

607
01:07:14,081 --> 01:07:18,484
He was breathing fire.
You don't believe me, do you?

608
01:07:18,686 --> 01:07:20,586
Little gal, l does.

609
01:07:20,788 --> 01:07:23,154
l tell you, Mr. Bond.
Let's get out of here.

610
01:07:23,391 --> 01:07:26,690
Listen, both of you.
There are no such things as dragons.

611
01:07:26,861 --> 01:07:29,193
What you saw
was something that looked like one.

612
01:07:29,397 --> 01:07:31,297
l'm trying to think
what it was.

613
01:07:31,499 --> 01:07:35,196
How do you know there aren't ?
What do you know about animals?

614
01:07:35,403 --> 01:07:37,268
Did you ever see
a mongoose dance...

615
01:07:37,438 --> 01:07:40,669
...or a scorpion with sunstroke
sting itself to death...

616
01:07:40,875 --> 01:07:44,072
...or a praying mantis eat her husband
after making love?

617
01:07:44,278 --> 01:07:46,678
-l hate to admit it, but l haven't .
-Well, l have.

618
01:07:47,148 --> 01:07:48,638
She's right.

619
01:07:50,284 --> 01:07:53,344
They've gone. Honey,
you're getting out of here.

620
01:07:53,554 --> 01:07:56,546
l'll get out when l'm ready,
and that's never in daylight.

621
01:07:56,757 --> 01:07:58,816
This time you are, and fast.

622
01:07:59,026 --> 01:08:00,891
Where's your boat?

623
01:08:01,963 --> 01:08:03,897
Fetch my shoes.

624
01:08:11,439 --> 01:08:13,532
Look what they've done!

625
01:08:13,741 --> 01:08:15,606
lt's all your fault!

626
01:08:17,245 --> 01:08:21,614
l'm sorry. l'll get you a new boat
when we get back to Kingston.

627
01:08:21,816 --> 01:08:23,841
What are we going to do
with her now?

628
01:08:24,952 --> 01:08:27,944
lf you like, l know a good place
where we can hide.

629
01:08:28,155 --> 01:08:30,885
That'll do for a start.
Leave what you don't need. Quick!

630
01:08:31,092 --> 01:08:32,389
All right, all right.

631
01:08:56,083 --> 01:09:00,816
-Must we come this way?
-lt throws the dogs off the scent.

632
01:09:01,989 --> 01:09:05,322
-Damn mosquitos!
-Rub water all over yourself.

633
01:09:05,526 --> 01:09:08,359
lt's the salt they're after.

634
01:09:13,734 --> 01:09:16,202
Quick! They's coming!
Across there!

635
01:09:19,607 --> 01:09:22,337
Cut some of those reeds!
Give me the knife.

636
01:09:23,411 --> 01:09:25,345
Over there.

637
01:09:36,824 --> 01:09:38,291
They're coming closer.

638
01:09:39,560 --> 01:09:41,460
-Quiet!
-Something's biting my foot!

639
01:09:41,662 --> 01:09:44,825
lf you disturb the mud,
they'll know we're here. Get down.

640
01:10:09,824 --> 01:10:11,621
Look like they're onto something.

641
01:10:56,737 --> 01:10:58,227
Down. Get down.

642
01:11:35,910 --> 01:11:38,310
-Why?
-Because l had to.

643
01:11:38,813 --> 01:11:42,544
The guy knew his business, trailing us
after we'd let the others pass.

644
01:11:42,750 --> 01:11:45,184
Let's get out of here.
Where's your hiding place?

645
01:11:45,386 --> 01:11:46,717
Up there.

646
01:11:49,056 --> 01:11:50,216
Come on.

647
01:12:01,469 --> 01:12:03,733
You smell nicer already.

648
01:12:04,638 --> 01:12:06,071
Oh, thank you.

649
01:12:06,807 --> 01:12:09,367
Mr. Bond! Quick!

650
01:12:12,446 --> 01:12:13,777
-What now?
-Look!

651
01:12:17,384 --> 01:12:19,511
Those are dragon tracks.

652
01:12:20,221 --> 01:12:23,156
Look! That's where he breathed!

653
01:12:23,390 --> 01:12:25,756
You ought to get some rest
if you want to.

654
01:12:25,926 --> 01:12:30,625
l stay out here and watch in case
he smells us and comes looking for us.

655
01:12:30,831 --> 01:12:32,992
Right. l'll take the second watch.

656
01:12:34,468 --> 01:12:36,402
We'll be out of here by midnight.

657
01:12:39,773 --> 01:12:42,435
l never met a detective before.

658
01:12:43,811 --> 01:12:47,212
-Are you going to arrest Dr. No?
-Someone is.

659
01:12:47,414 --> 01:12:50,781
We can't have him trying
to kill everyone who comes here.

660
01:12:50,985 --> 01:12:53,351
He doesn't just try.

661
01:12:53,554 --> 01:12:57,149
-l'm pretty sure he killed my father.
-What do you mean?

662
01:12:57,324 --> 01:13:01,192
You see, my father was
a marine zoologist.

663
01:13:01,395 --> 01:13:04,660
We came to the Caribbean
for him to study seashells.

664
01:13:04,865 --> 01:13:09,131
One day, he came to Crab Key,
and l never saw him again.

665
01:13:10,037 --> 01:13:11,902
They said he must have drowned.

666
01:13:12,439 --> 01:13:15,374
But he was too good a diver
for that to happen.

667
01:13:15,576 --> 01:13:18,204
Didn't the police investigate?
What about your family?

668
01:13:18,412 --> 01:13:21,210
They investigated for a long time.

669
01:13:21,415 --> 01:13:23,883
Then they said,
"Missing, presumed dead."

670
01:13:24,084 --> 01:13:27,417
l haven't any family.
There was only my father and me.

671
01:13:27,621 --> 01:13:29,179
You're here alone?

672
01:13:29,390 --> 01:13:31,381
Where did you live
before you came here?

673
01:13:31,592 --> 01:13:33,457
All over the world.

674
01:13:33,827 --> 01:13:37,695
The Philippines, Bali, Hawaii.
About anywhere there were shells.

675
01:13:37,898 --> 01:13:39,695
You went to school somewhere.

676
01:13:39,900 --> 01:13:42,767
l didn't need to.
We had an encyclopedia.

677
01:13:42,970 --> 01:13:46,701
l started at " A" when l was 8,
and now l've reached "T."

678
01:13:46,907 --> 01:13:48,898
l bet l know a lot more things
than you do.

679
01:13:51,145 --> 01:13:54,012
Didn't anyone in Kingston help?

680
01:13:54,215 --> 01:13:59,050
Well, there was this man who owned
the place where we were living.

681
01:13:59,253 --> 01:14:02,347
He let me stay on for a while
without paying.

682
01:14:02,556 --> 01:14:04,990
Then one night,
he came up to my room.

683
01:14:06,393 --> 01:14:07,382
Well, you know.

684
01:14:08,395 --> 01:14:13,355
l scratched his face, and then--
But he was stronger than l was.

685
01:14:14,034 --> 01:14:15,194
What happened?

686
01:14:17,004 --> 01:14:21,236
l put a black widow spider
underneath his mosquito net.

687
01:14:21,442 --> 01:14:23,637
A female, and they're the worst.

688
01:14:23,844 --> 01:14:26,142
lt took him a whole week to die.

689
01:14:29,283 --> 01:14:30,307
Did l do wrong?

690
01:14:31,719 --> 01:14:34,449
lt wouldn't do
to make a habit of it.

691
01:14:37,224 --> 01:14:39,283
Do you have
a woman of your own?

692
01:14:43,097 --> 01:14:44,530
Quick! Down here!

693
01:14:46,066 --> 01:14:48,660
Whatever's coming,
it's coming this way.

694
01:14:49,103 --> 01:14:50,968
This time, l want to see it.

695
01:14:51,705 --> 01:14:54,606
And hurry!
There's less than 1 2 hours to go.

696
01:15:20,467 --> 01:15:23,231
Stay where you are!
All of you!

697
01:15:23,404 --> 01:15:25,838
Stay right where you are!

698
01:15:36,183 --> 01:15:38,947
Okay, captain.
lf that ain't a dragon, what is it?

699
01:15:39,153 --> 01:15:42,179
A dragon that runs on diesel engines.
Forget the spooks.

700
01:15:42,389 --> 01:15:45,916
When it's closer, take the driver.
l'll take the headlights and the tires.

701
01:15:46,126 --> 01:15:48,856
You keep safe out of sight.
Come on.

702
01:16:24,898 --> 01:16:27,025
-l said to stay there.
-l was frightened.

703
01:16:27,234 --> 01:16:28,394
Then get down.

704
01:16:40,047 --> 01:16:41,036
Don't look.

705
01:16:44,017 --> 01:16:46,076
Come on out!
Hands where we can see them!

706
01:16:48,789 --> 01:16:51,019
And the dame! Quick!

707
01:16:51,225 --> 01:16:53,125
Unless you want an extra navel.

708
01:16:56,130 --> 01:16:57,995
Hold it. Drop that gun.

709
01:16:59,833 --> 01:17:01,767
Kick it away from you.

710
01:17:03,937 --> 01:17:08,874
The girl will stay where she is.
Walk towards me, hands out in front.

711
01:17:19,153 --> 01:17:24,090
Come on! Hey, you!
Where do you think you're going?

712
01:17:25,192 --> 01:17:29,424
Sorry we ain't got any flowers.
Come on, let's go.

713
01:17:29,630 --> 01:17:31,894
Come on! Let's go.

714
01:17:36,804 --> 01:17:37,793
Give me that knife!

715
01:17:51,318 --> 01:17:54,754
-Leave him alone!
-Get out of the way!

716
01:18:11,472 --> 01:18:14,270
Get inside!
Keep an eye on the man.

717
01:18:15,576 --> 01:18:19,808
Be careful. They've been in the swamp
and they're contaminated.

718
01:18:22,950 --> 01:18:25,441
Check that Geiger reading.

719
01:18:31,992 --> 01:18:35,450
He's reading 95, chief.
She's 88.

720
01:18:35,662 --> 01:18:39,029
Too much for the monitors.
Scrub them down but quick!

721
01:18:51,478 --> 01:18:53,105
Turn around.

722
01:19:01,588 --> 01:19:04,819
-Reading 72.8.
-The mud's soaked into their clothes.

723
01:19:05,025 --> 01:19:07,289
All right.
Take off all their clothes.

724
01:19:07,494 --> 01:19:08,791
What'll he do?

725
01:19:08,996 --> 01:19:11,055
We picked up
radioactive contamination.

726
01:19:11,265 --> 01:19:14,098
-Do the girl first.
-We give the orders here!

727
01:19:14,301 --> 01:19:17,634
Fine, but do something about this.
Come here, you.

728
01:19:17,838 --> 01:19:19,806
Here.

729
01:19:20,007 --> 01:19:23,340
Use the high-temperature jets.
Full pressure.

730
01:19:31,051 --> 01:19:32,678
Sixty-eight.

731
01:19:35,289 --> 01:19:38,554
-She's reading 4 7.
-All right. Put the man through.

732
01:19:39,860 --> 01:19:41,885
He's now clocking 40.

733
01:19:42,729 --> 01:19:44,458
lt is still high.

734
01:19:45,232 --> 01:19:46,893
Reading 38.

735
01:19:48,435 --> 01:19:50,426
Thirty-two.

736
01:19:51,004 --> 01:19:53,438
-Down to eight.
-Hold the girl. Stage three.

737
01:19:56,009 --> 01:19:57,943
He's now 1 8.

738
01:20:01,081 --> 01:20:03,015
He's now at eight.

739
01:20:06,053 --> 01:20:10,046
-Practically zero. She's clear.
-Good. Get the man ready.

740
01:20:14,761 --> 01:20:16,729
He's got a count of four.

741
01:20:16,930 --> 01:20:20,024
-Check his fingernails.
-Put your hands in there.

742
01:20:21,301 --> 01:20:24,862
-He's okay.
-l'll notify reception they're coming.

743
01:20:25,806 --> 01:20:29,435
Decontamination here.
They're coming through now.

744
01:20:56,903 --> 01:20:59,371
Come in. Come in.

745
01:21:02,009 --> 01:21:05,775
You poor dears. We simply
didn't know when to expect you.

746
01:21:05,979 --> 01:21:08,777
First, it was teatime yesterday,
then dinner.

747
01:21:08,982 --> 01:21:11,951
lt was only a half-hour ago
we knew you were on your way.

748
01:21:12,152 --> 01:21:15,815
Cigarette? There's American,
English and Turkish.

749
01:21:16,023 --> 01:21:18,116
l'm Sister Rose.
This is Sister Lily.

750
01:21:18,325 --> 01:21:20,486
We're here to make
your stay pleasant.

751
01:21:20,694 --> 01:21:24,994
-That's kind of you, but--
-You'll be wanting to see your rooms.

752
01:21:25,232 --> 01:21:29,259
Breakfast is already ordered
and then you'll want to sleep.

753
01:21:32,372 --> 01:21:35,933
The doctor left orders you're
not to be disturbed until tonight.

754
01:21:36,143 --> 01:21:39,772
He'd be delighted if you'd join him
for dinner. Shall l say you'll be there?

755
01:21:39,980 --> 01:21:42,346
-Tell him l'll also be delighted.
-Splendid.

756
01:21:42,549 --> 01:21:45,347
l know he'll be pleased.
Here we are.

757
01:21:48,021 --> 01:21:50,546
This will be your room, Mr. Bond.

758
01:21:51,625 --> 01:21:54,719
This is your bathroom in here.

759
01:21:54,928 --> 01:21:57,522
And for you, young lady...

760
01:21:57,731 --> 01:21:59,596
...this is your room.

761
01:22:02,502 --> 01:22:05,369
You'll find fresh clothes in here.

762
01:22:07,708 --> 01:22:09,505
l hope they fit.

763
01:22:09,710 --> 01:22:12,144
We didn't get your sizes
till last night.

764
01:22:12,345 --> 01:22:15,439
Ring if there's anything else
you want. Anything at all.

765
01:22:15,649 --> 01:22:18,049
Such as two air tickets to London?

766
01:22:19,252 --> 01:22:22,016
l'll leave you two dear people
in peace.

767
01:22:36,303 --> 01:22:38,237
Let's have some breakfast.

768
01:22:39,039 --> 01:22:42,304
-How can you eat at a time like this?
-Because l'm hungry.

769
01:22:42,509 --> 01:22:45,137
We don't know when we'll get
a chance to eat again.

770
01:22:45,345 --> 01:22:46,812
Here. Take this.

771
01:22:47,013 --> 01:22:50,915
Careful. The whole place
is probably wired for sound.

772
01:23:01,628 --> 01:23:03,323
Have you--

773
01:23:04,397 --> 01:23:06,888
Have you any idea
what they'll do with us?

774
01:23:07,100 --> 01:23:08,397
No idea.

775
01:23:09,736 --> 01:23:12,136
No door handles
or windows either.

776
01:23:15,308 --> 01:23:20,245
-lt's a prison, then.
-Mink-lined, with first-class service.

777
01:23:23,917 --> 01:23:25,851
What's the matter?

778
01:23:26,987 --> 01:23:28,852
l don't feel so good.

779
01:23:31,124 --> 01:23:33,456
l feel so sleepy.

780
01:23:36,730 --> 01:23:38,664
Damn coffee!

781
01:24:53,073 --> 01:24:55,007
How do you feel?

782
01:24:57,377 --> 01:24:58,639
Sleepy.

783
01:25:00,480 --> 01:25:02,471
What made us
pass out like that?

784
01:25:02,682 --> 01:25:04,377
The coffee was drugged.

785
01:25:10,423 --> 01:25:13,449
Time for dinner. We don't want
to keep the doctor waiting.

786
01:25:13,660 --> 01:25:15,594
That would never do. Ready?

787
01:25:18,064 --> 01:25:19,622
l suppose so.

788
01:25:24,671 --> 01:25:26,605
You're doing fine.

789
01:25:30,310 --> 01:25:32,244
Come on.

790
01:25:33,546 --> 01:25:35,639
Am l properly dressed
for the occasion?

791
01:25:35,849 --> 01:25:38,477
-Quite suitable.
-Suitable for what?

792
01:25:51,464 --> 01:25:52,988
This way, please.

793
01:25:56,970 --> 01:25:59,268
l'm glad your hands
are sweating too.

794
01:25:59,472 --> 01:26:01,303
Of course. l'm scared too.

795
01:26:01,508 --> 01:26:04,375
So be natural,
and leave all the talking to me.

796
01:26:04,577 --> 01:26:06,408
ln here, please.

797
01:26:06,613 --> 01:26:08,843
l hope you enjoy your dinner.

798
01:27:04,704 --> 01:27:06,638
Come and look.

799
01:27:16,116 --> 01:27:17,811
Artificial light.

800
01:27:18,018 --> 01:27:20,179
We could be hundreds of feet
beneath the sea.

801
01:27:20,387 --> 01:27:24,483
Look at that. Sea tulips.
They do not grow above 200 feet.

802
01:27:24,724 --> 01:27:27,056
One million dollars, Mr. Bond.

803
01:27:28,294 --> 01:27:30,159
You were wondering what it cost.

804
01:27:30,930 --> 01:27:32,192
As a matter of fact, l was.

805
01:27:40,273 --> 01:27:43,765
Forgive my not shaking hands.
lt's awkward with these. A misfortune.

806
01:27:44,177 --> 01:27:46,270
You were admiring my aquarium.

807
01:27:48,081 --> 01:27:50,174
Yes. lt's quite impressive.

808
01:27:50,383 --> 01:27:54,080
A unique feat of engineering.
l designed it myself.

809
01:27:54,287 --> 01:27:58,656
Convex glass, 1 0 inches thick, which
accounts for the magnifying effect.

810
01:27:58,858 --> 01:28:00,849
Minnows pretending they're whales.

811
01:28:01,061 --> 01:28:03,859
Just like you on this island, Dr. No.

812
01:28:04,064 --> 01:28:08,091
lt depends, Mr. Bond,
on which side of the glass you are.

813
01:28:09,335 --> 01:28:12,771
A medium-dry martini, lemon peel.
Shaken, not stirred.

814
01:28:12,972 --> 01:28:14,837
-Vodka?
-Of course.

815
01:28:16,042 --> 01:28:18,704
We'll have dinner at once.

816
01:28:18,912 --> 01:28:22,348
There's so much to discuss,
so little time.

817
01:28:45,004 --> 01:28:48,132
Well, Dr. No, you haven't
done badly, considering.

818
01:28:48,341 --> 01:28:50,332
A handicap is what you make of it.

819
01:28:50,543 --> 01:28:53,341
l was the unwanted child
of a German missionary...

820
01:28:53,546 --> 01:28:55,810
...and a Chinese girl
of good family.

821
01:28:56,015 --> 01:29:00,714
Yet l became treasurer of the most
powerful criminal society in China.

822
01:29:00,920 --> 01:29:05,584
lt's rare for the tongs to trust anyone
who isn't completely Chinese.

823
01:29:05,792 --> 01:29:07,987
l doubt they should do so again.

824
01:29:08,194 --> 01:29:11,721
l escaped to America with 1 0 million
of their dollars in gold.

825
01:29:11,931 --> 01:29:14,695
That's how you financed
this operation.

826
01:29:14,901 --> 01:29:17,096
lt was a good idea
to use atomic power.

827
01:29:17,270 --> 01:29:19,033
l'm glad you can handle it properly.

828
01:29:19,205 --> 01:29:23,938
l'd hate to think your decontamination
chamber wasn't effective.

829
01:29:24,177 --> 01:29:28,443
My work has given me
a unique knowledge of radioactivity...

830
01:29:28,615 --> 01:29:31,675
...but not without costs,
as you see.

831
01:29:34,287 --> 01:29:37,484
Your power source had our
organization puzzled for some time.

832
01:29:39,759 --> 01:29:41,750
They are still puzzled.

833
01:29:41,961 --> 01:29:44,589
Not any longer.
l sent a complete report.

834
01:29:45,431 --> 01:29:49,629
You've not contacted headquarters
since you requested a Geiger counter.

835
01:29:50,537 --> 01:29:53,506
There are so many files
open on you already.

836
01:29:54,340 --> 01:29:56,069
Our own, the ClA's ...

837
01:29:57,410 --> 01:30:00,436
...the one from the tong society
that you robbed.

838
01:30:00,647 --> 01:30:04,413
When trouble comes, you'll find
this is a very small and naked island.

839
01:30:04,617 --> 01:30:06,881
An expendable little island.

840
01:30:07,086 --> 01:30:10,453
When my mission in Crab Key
is done, l destroy it and move on.

841
01:30:11,090 --> 01:30:12,955
But the habit of inquiry
is persistent.

842
01:30:13,159 --> 01:30:15,127
l see you're wondering why,
where, when.

843
01:30:15,328 --> 01:30:18,661
l only gratify your curiosity
because you're the one man l've met...

844
01:30:18,865 --> 01:30:20,924
...capable of appreciating
what l've done...

845
01:30:22,202 --> 01:30:24,762
...and keeping it to himself.

846
01:30:25,471 --> 01:30:26,995
Just a minute.

847
01:30:27,207 --> 01:30:31,109
No point in involving the girl.
She has nothing to do with us.

848
01:30:31,778 --> 01:30:34,269
Let her go free.
She'll promise not to talk.

849
01:30:34,480 --> 01:30:37,176
-No, l'm staying with you.
-l don't want you here.

850
01:30:37,383 --> 01:30:41,683
l agree this is no place for the girl.
Take her away.

851
01:30:46,726 --> 01:30:48,785
l'm sure the guards
will amuse her.

852
01:30:48,995 --> 01:30:50,860
Let me go!

853
01:30:52,565 --> 01:30:56,865
That's a Dom Perignon '55.
lt would be a pity to break it.

854
01:31:00,940 --> 01:31:02,874
l prefer the '53 myself.

855
01:31:05,345 --> 01:31:08,837
Clumsy effort. You disappoint me.

856
01:31:09,048 --> 01:31:12,211
l'm not a fool,
so please don't treat me as one.

857
01:31:12,418 --> 01:31:15,319
That table knife,
please put it back.

858
01:31:18,157 --> 01:31:20,887
We can't all be geniuses,
can we?

859
01:31:21,094 --> 01:31:23,358
Tell me, does toppling
American missiles...

860
01:31:23,563 --> 01:31:26,054
...really compensate
for having no hands?

861
01:31:27,166 --> 01:31:29,828
Missiles are only the first step
to prove our power.

862
01:31:30,036 --> 01:31:31,663
"Our power" ?

863
01:31:31,871 --> 01:31:34,931
With your disregard for human life,
you must be working for the East.

864
01:31:35,108 --> 01:31:38,839
East, West. Points of the compass,
each as stupid as the other.

865
01:31:39,012 --> 01:31:41,674
-l'm a member of SPECTRE.
-SPECTRE?

866
01:31:41,848 --> 01:31:45,306
SPECTRE: "Special Executive
for Counterintelligence...

867
01:31:45,518 --> 01:31:48,214
...Terrorism, Revenge, Extortion."

868
01:31:48,421 --> 01:31:50,480
The four great
cornerstones of power...

869
01:31:50,690 --> 01:31:52,783
...headed by the
world's greatest brains.

870
01:31:52,992 --> 01:31:55,426
Correction. Criminal brains.

871
01:31:55,628 --> 01:31:59,564
The successful criminal brain
is always superior. lt has to be.

872
01:31:59,766 --> 01:32:01,597
Why become criminal?

873
01:32:01,801 --> 01:32:05,635
l'm sure the West would welcome
a scientist of your caliber.

874
01:32:06,706 --> 01:32:10,005
The Americans are fools.
l offered my services, they refused.

875
01:32:10,209 --> 01:32:14,509
So did the East. Now they can
both pay for their mistake.

876
01:32:15,081 --> 01:32:18,881
World domination.
That same old dream.

877
01:32:19,085 --> 01:32:23,112
Our asylums are full of people
who think they're Napoleon or God.

878
01:32:28,628 --> 01:32:31,290
You persist in trying to provoke me.

879
01:32:31,998 --> 01:32:35,024
-l could've had you killed in the swamp.
-Why didn't you?

880
01:32:36,436 --> 01:32:38,495
l thought you less stupid.

881
01:32:38,705 --> 01:32:41,435
Usually when a man
gets in my way--

882
01:32:45,945 --> 01:32:49,278
But you were different.
You cost me time, money, effort.

883
01:32:49,482 --> 01:32:52,849
You damaged my organization
and my pride.

884
01:32:53,820 --> 01:32:55,879
l was curious to see
what kind of man you were.

885
01:32:56,089 --> 01:32:58,819
l thought there might
be a place for you at SPECTRE.

886
01:32:59,659 --> 01:33:01,524
l'm flattered.

887
01:33:01,728 --> 01:33:04,993
l'd prefer the revenge department.

888
01:33:05,765 --> 01:33:10,065
My first job would be finding the man
who killed Strangways and Quarrel.

889
01:33:10,269 --> 01:33:14,899
Unfortunately, l misjudged you.
You are just a stupid policeman...

890
01:33:17,977 --> 01:33:19,911
...whose luck has run out.

891
01:33:21,347 --> 01:33:24,373
They're waiting for you
in the control room, Dr. No.

892
01:33:25,184 --> 01:33:28,745
No hurry. They won't have started
their countdown check yet.

893
01:33:28,955 --> 01:33:31,082
You won't get away with it
this time.

894
01:33:31,290 --> 01:33:34,157
The Americans are prepared
for any trouble.

895
01:33:35,228 --> 01:33:38,129
l never fail, Mr. Bond.

896
01:33:38,431 --> 01:33:40,228
What do we do with him?

897
01:33:40,433 --> 01:33:43,766
Soften him up.
l haven't finished with him yet.

898
01:39:24,076 --> 01:39:26,772
Have you got
new fuel elements loaded?

899
01:39:27,213 --> 01:39:29,010
All ready, sir.

900
01:39:31,350 --> 01:39:34,649
The roadblock is 3000 feet away,

901
01:39:34,854 --> 01:39:38,688
Everyone in that area's pulled back,
No traffic allowed,

902
01:39:38,891 --> 01:39:41,257
The launch area
is cleared for safety,

903
01:39:41,460 --> 01:39:44,156
The only personnel within
the area are the crew,,,

904
01:39:44,363 --> 01:39:47,230
,,,inside the blockhouse
and the test counter,

905
01:39:47,433 --> 01:39:51,699
The alarm hasn't been given,
but the time must be near the count,

906
01:39:51,904 --> 01:39:55,305
The vehicle is now at
its full weight of 2 40 tons,,,

907
01:39:55,508 --> 01:39:58,909
,,,and all automatic transistors
have been put on the vehicle,

908
01:39:59,145 --> 01:40:01,511
We will run up to half-power
for 30 seconds.

909
01:40:05,584 --> 01:40:07,677
Control interlocks free.

910
01:40:07,853 --> 01:40:10,822
Fuel elements, 1 2.5.

911
01:40:29,809 --> 01:40:33,836
-Control?
-Control rod actuators operating.

912

Core temperature, 1 1 3.

913

-Converters?
-Converters standing by.

-Radiation?
-Counters 1 2 1 , 1 41 , 1 09.

916
01:40:46,992 --> 01:40:50,985
-Energy stabilizers?
-Energy steady at 0.8 megawatts.

917
01:40:51,197 --> 01:40:55,566
--system of tracking stations
are plugged into Mercury Control,

918
01:40:55,768 --> 01:40:56,996
Fuel elements?

919
01:40:58,470 --> 01:41:01,405
Fuel elements! Where's Chang?

920
01:41:02,308 --> 01:41:05,141
Chang! What are you doing?
Get on the gantry!

921
01:41:08,380 --> 01:41:09,369
Hurry!

922
01:41:16,355 --> 01:41:19,552
-Shut down.
-Shut down reactors!

923
01:41:19,758 --> 01:41:24,195
This is where control should
make a second go or no-go decision,

924
01:41:28,133 --> 01:41:32,126
This is Mercury Control,
The countdown for the--

925
01:41:32,338 --> 01:41:35,239
Reactor shutdown,
temperature 22 7, falling.

926
01:41:35,641 --> 01:41:38,337
-Converters off.
-Convertors off.

927
01:41:38,510 --> 01:41:39,807
Radiation reading.

928
01:41:40,012 --> 01:41:42,071
Radiation zero.

929
01:41:42,715 --> 01:41:46,014
Shutdown procedure complete.
Reactor safe.

930
01:41:48,387 --> 01:41:51,356
-Stand by.
-We'll stay on spacecraft control,,,

931
01:41:51,557 --> 01:41:52,922
,,,for final countdown,

932
01:41:53,125 --> 01:41:55,150
This is Mercury Control,

Check indicates
all systems are go at this time,

934
01:42:00,165 --> 01:42:04,397
The countdown is now

This is Mercury Control,

937
01:42:11,477 --> 01:42:14,105
The spacecraft pilot, the launch,,,

938
01:42:14,313 --> 01:42:16,577
,,,the tracking crew
in case of emergency,,,

939
01:42:16,782 --> 01:42:20,411
,,,and even the weatherman,
have given us the word "go, "

940
01:42:20,920 --> 01:42:23,650
Remain on standby.
Approximately two minutes to go.

941
01:42:23,856 --> 01:42:26,586
Control rod actuators
standing by.

942
01:42:27,693 --> 01:42:29,752
Converters standing by.

943
01:42:30,696 --> 01:42:33,028
Synchronize radio beam for toppling.

944
01:42:34,700 --> 01:42:37,635
Synchronizing radio beam
for toppling.

945
01:42:50,582 --> 01:42:52,641
Radio beam synchronized
for toppling.

946
01:42:53,319 --> 01:42:55,787
Zero in your mark now.

947
01:42:55,988 --> 01:42:59,389
We will stay on Mercury Control
for final countdown,

948
01:42:59,591 --> 01:43:01,456
Stand by.

949
01:43:01,660 --> 01:43:04,823
Run to full power.
Fuel elements, 2 1 .

950
01:43:05,030 --> 01:43:07,294
Attention, all controls.

951
01:43:07,499 --> 01:43:09,865
Going into operation now.

952
01:43:10,069 --> 01:43:13,004
Control has been made,

953
01:43:13,205 --> 01:43:15,833
The umbilical is retracted,

954
01:43:16,041 --> 01:43:20,171
All elements of progress
and operation are in good condition,,,

955
01:43:20,379 --> 01:43:21,607
,,,for the flight,

956
01:43:21,847 --> 01:43:25,943
We are in T-minus 1 9 seconds
and counting,

957
01:43:29,855 --> 01:43:32,653
T-minus 1 5 and counting,

958

,,,eight, seven--

960
01:43:44,403 --> 01:43:47,463
Stop, you fools! Shut down!

961

The tower has been jettisoned,

966
01:44:48,801 --> 01:44:52,532
There's the rocket against
that gray sky, and it's green!

967
01:44:52,738 --> 01:44:56,174
We can see the outline of the rocket,
The engines are burning,

968
01:44:56,375 --> 01:44:59,606
You can hear that the roar
still sounds good and true,

969
01:44:59,812 --> 01:45:03,805
lt's above the fourth tank,
lt's a very hot rocket,

970
01:45:04,016 --> 01:45:08,578
You can see the flame of it
coming into clear, blue sky,,,

971
01:45:08,787 --> 01:45:11,381
,,,up in the sunlight,
beginning to gleam,

972
01:45:11,590 --> 01:45:13,319
Very good, steady climb,

973
01:45:13,492 --> 01:45:15,357
All systems go!

974
01:45:31,410 --> 01:45:33,344
Honey! Honey!

975
01:45:50,195 --> 01:45:53,164
-Where's the girl l came in with?
-l don't know!

976
01:45:55,801 --> 01:45:58,133
Where's the girl
they brought in with me?

977
01:45:58,337 --> 01:46:00,202
-Number 1 2.
-Show me!

978
01:47:34,666 --> 01:47:36,600
We've run out of fuel.

979
01:47:40,672 --> 01:47:42,537
What are we going to do now?

980
01:47:42,741 --> 01:47:44,971
Well, we can swim or--

981
01:47:45,844 --> 01:47:47,038
Or what?

982
01:47:47,246 --> 01:47:48,713
Come here.

983
01:48:02,728 --> 01:48:05,288
Ahoy, Mr. Bond! Ahoy, Mr. Bond!

984
01:48:07,099 --> 01:48:10,626
Well, well! What's the matter?
Do you need help?

985
01:48:13,205 --> 01:48:14,672
l'm quite sure you don't .

986
01:48:15,073 --> 01:48:17,564
Now that you're here,
give us a tow.

987
