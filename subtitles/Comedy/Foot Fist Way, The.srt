623
00:54:23,873 --> 00:54:26,353
You did your job,
so don't worry!

624
00:54:26,433 --> 00:54:29,913
You'll get your money.
And you know what's better?

625
00:54:30,033 --> 00:54:33,473
When the Japanese take over,
then we'll be set.

626
00:54:33,552 --> 00:54:36,993
Then there'll be lots of money.
Do you understand?

627
00:54:41,793 --> 00:54:44,992
I wish I had known.

628
00:54:45,072 --> 00:54:48,872
You should've told me
that Thorazide was poisonous!

629
00:54:48,952 --> 00:54:51,152
I never would've
Given it to him.

630

[ Gagging ]

631
00:54:56,552 --> 00:54:59,951
[Woman Screams]
Help! Help!

632
00:55:01,352 --> 00:55:03,152
It's the cook!

633
00:55:03,272 --> 00:55:05,072
Someone help me
get him down!

634
00:55:05,192 --> 00:55:07,071
[ Sobbing ]

635
00:55:07,151 --> 00:55:10,471
Lift him off the rope! Now!

636
00:55:10,591 --> 00:55:13,791
Come on.
Let's move it along.

637
00:55:19,990 --> 00:55:23,710
- We found traces of Thorazide on this.
- Really?

638
00:55:23,830 --> 00:55:26,311
That's the bark
Of a ginkgo tree.

639
00:55:26,431 --> 00:55:30,110
- It's used for asthma.
- What did he say we do with it?

640
00:55:30,190 --> 00:55:33,870
Wait, the Master had asthma.
And the cook used to treat it.

641
00:55:33,990 --> 00:55:35,790
- Oh, he did?
- Uh-huh.

642
00:55:35,910 --> 00:55:39,830
That means the cook's the one
who gave him the poison.

643
00:55:39,950 --> 00:55:42,870
That's very interesting.

644
00:55:43,309 --> 00:55:46,629
Hey, listen, Captain.
Let's keep this quiet, okay?

645
00:55:46,749 --> 00:55:49,549
Makes no difference.
He's dead anyway.

646
00:55:49,629 --> 00:55:52,389
We can't keep a murder a secret!

647
00:55:52,509 --> 00:55:55,549
For all we know,
there may be others involved.

648
00:55:55,669 --> 00:55:59,789
We're really gonna have
to investigate to find out for sure.

649
00:55:59,869 --> 00:56:02,029
An investigation.

650
00:56:02,149 --> 00:56:04,428
The school will never survive
this scandal.

651
00:56:04,548 --> 00:56:06,548
Ask him.

652
00:56:07,829 --> 00:56:10,588
Captain, so now what?

653
00:56:10,668 --> 00:56:12,548
Go investigate some more.

654
00:56:12,628 --> 00:56:15,348
How 'bout these?
What now?

655
00:56:15,468 --> 00:56:17,707
Get an analysis done
right away.

656
00:56:17,827 --> 00:56:21,708
Captain, could you help me
look for Ting En now?

657
00:56:21,828 --> 00:56:24,187
Don't worry.
I'll find him.

658
00:56:45,346 --> 00:56:47,586
Excuse me.
Are you looking for someone?

659
00:56:47,706 --> 00:56:50,787
I wonder if I could
please talk to Mr. Nang?

660
00:56:50,907 --> 00:56:54,066
- He's right here. Follow me.
- Mmm.

661
00:56:57,906 --> 00:57:00,266
Uncle, this lady's here
to see you.

662
00:57:00,346 --> 00:57:03,146
- Can I help you?
- I hope so.

663
00:57:03,266 --> 00:57:07,425
I know that you and the whole police
force have been looking for Ting En.

664
00:57:07,545 --> 00:57:10,025
Do you know
where I might find him?

665
00:57:11,745 --> 00:57:16,065
- Uh, the Star House.
- A whorehouse?

666

- [ Gasps ]
- Mmm.

667
00:57:33,304 --> 00:57:35,624
Is he staying with you?

668
00:57:36,864 --> 00:57:38,704
He is.

669
00:57:43,784 --> 00:57:46,704
How long have you been seeing him?

670
00:57:48,183 --> 00:57:50,664
About a year,
maybe longer.

671
00:57:51,984 --> 00:57:56,583
For the first few months,
he seemed to be happy.

672
00:57:56,663 --> 00:58:00,383
Now he fights all the time.
He talks about Jing Wu.

673
00:58:00,463 --> 00:58:03,703
About how he misses his home.

674
00:58:03,823 --> 00:58:07,543

Won't you try and take him home?

You're here.

684
00:59:00,820 --> 00:59:03,780
There must be a reason.

685
00:59:03,900 --> 00:59:06,140
The Niguchi Clan
came to see us.

686
00:59:06,220 --> 00:59:08,699
They've challenged you.

687
00:59:09,740 --> 00:59:11,739
What about Chen?

You are the Master of Jing Wu.

You'll come back?

693
00:59:33,379 --> 00:59:35,059
Of course.

What about Miss Shien?

You're going to leave her
after all she's done?

698
00:59:52,257 --> 00:59:54,417
You buy her out.

00:59:56,017 --> 00:59:58,777
- Get the Madam.
- Yes, sir.

700
00:59:58,897 --> 01:00:01,377
We'll pay.

701
01:00:04,497 --> 01:00:07,856
I guess you won't be wearing
all those fancy dresses anymore.

No, but I really
won't miss them.

That one fits you well,
and it looks so good on you.

is the best warrior of his clan,
in fact, in all of Japan.

is on for tomorrow. Practice.

Ting En against
the Niguchi Master.

722
01:01:18,014 --> 01:01:21,614
Then he must be the best
At Jing Wu now.

723
01:01:21,693 --> 01:01:23,773
He is.

724
01:01:23,853 --> 01:01:26,293
Better than Chen?

725
01:01:26,373 --> 01:01:29,853
It's not important.
They're both good.

- Master, I'm sorry.
- Are you hurt?

- What's wrong? He isn't the same.
- Hmm.

Funakoshi,
you will fight Ting En tomorrow.

don't even dare try to tell me...
who I will challenge.

So it's Chen Zhen.
Then let me tell you something.

I know all about him...
and your niece.

So? Mitsuko is in no way
any of your concern.

01:02:57,809 --> 01:03:00,168
I'll make her my concern
If she's your weakness.

01:03:00,249 --> 01:03:02,968
Hmph.

738
01:03:03,048 --> 01:03:08,328
Whatever weakness is that the General
is perceiving would have to be his own.

739
01:03:08,448 --> 01:03:11,208
I have none.

01:03:28,767 --> 01:03:30,687
You're up early today.

isn't that Uncle?

- It is you!
- Oh, Mitsuko!

744
01:03:46,207 --> 01:03:49,087
If I'd known you live so far from town,
I'd have hired a carriage.

745
01:03:49,207 --> 01:03:53,406
- Did my father send you?
- No. In fact,
he doesn't even know I'm here.

746
01:03:53,486 --> 01:03:55,926
Then why'd you come
all this way?

747
01:03:56,966 --> 01:04:01,086
- To see him.
- Chen Zhen?

748
01:04:01,206 --> 01:04:04,965
- Are you married?
- Not yet.

749
01:04:05,085 --> 01:04:07,686
- Do you want to be?
- I think so...

750
01:04:07,806 --> 01:04:10,805
if the Chinese and Japanese
ever stop fighting.

751
01:04:10,885 --> 01:04:13,205
It's good you're not married.

752
01:04:13,325 --> 01:04:17,085
You're much too young...
to become a widow.

753
01:04:17,165 --> 01:04:19,004
What's that?

754
01:04:19,085 --> 01:04:23,204
And if you should die,
I'll send your ashes back to Japan.

755
01:04:23,324 --> 01:04:26,285
You sound very confident.

756
01:04:28,404 --> 01:04:31,084
Why didn't you tell me
you're gonna fight my uncle?

757
01:04:31,204 --> 01:04:34,204
Well, he didn't want
to worry you.

758
01:04:34,324 --> 01:04:36,564
Chen Zhen, come.

759
01:04:45,283 --> 01:04:49,483
So anxious. Why don't you
show me what you've learned?

760
01:04:57,283 --> 01:05:00,723
It's about the energy. About focusing
on a single point in time.

761
01:05:00,803 --> 01:05:03,803
So, it's about energy.

762
01:05:03,923 --> 01:05:08,482
But tell me something. Does a rock have
as much energy as an opponent would?

763
01:05:08,602 --> 01:05:11,643
You need a more powerful stroke
When you're fighting a human being.

764
01:05:13,162 --> 01:05:15,322
Let's see how I can put it
into action.

765
01:05:15,442 --> 01:05:18,842
Hmph. What else
has Master Hou taught you?

766
01:05:18,922 --> 01:05:21,842
Simple.
Observe your opponent.

767
01:05:21,922 --> 01:05:24,761
Attack him.
Learn to exploit his weakness.

768
01:05:24,842 --> 01:05:29,162
Ah! Sounds to me like
you've been learning karate...

769
01:05:29,282 --> 01:05:31,241
becoming samurai.

770
01:05:31,361 --> 01:05:35,521
Not from Master Hou.
He taught us the art of kung fu.

771
01:05:35,641 --> 01:05:40,761
Just because the principles are similar,
does it mean we learn karate?

772
01:05:40,881 --> 01:05:42,760
Hmm.

773
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:47,680
So tell me what lessons you've learned
about controlling one's anger.

774
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:50,161
Don't tell me your Master
forgot that one?

775
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:53,641
You didn't come here to talk.
It's time.

776
01:05:53,761 --> 01:05:56,080
Hmm.

777
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:03,360
Wait!

778
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:29,599
Hold it!

779
01:06:29,718 --> 01:06:31,718

The insect has the advantage.

But as soon
as the elephant wakes...

it has the strength
to eliminate the insect!

And, yet again...

844

if the military
can take control of Shanghai...

845

it will weaken the elephant
in a big way.
