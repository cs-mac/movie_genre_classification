- No. No, I didn't meet her.

I saw one of her movies, in Venice.

Norman, I told you, I don't want to

- Giuseppe, you're gonna make a hole back there.

There's 800 million people there.

They're looking for a restaurant.

Isaac Stern didn't want to go.
What happened?. Academy Award.

- Claude, the programs
are being printed next week.
- What?.

177
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:41,722
Somebody said you're substituting
another piece for the Mozart.

178
00:12:41,794 --> 00:12:44,422
- I haven't made a decision yet.
- Go with Rossini or Verdi.

179
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:46,624
- Giuseppe, cut the hair.
- The printer's ready to kill me.

We have to have something to put on there.
All we have is the name of the concert hall.

Then the programs are blank. We'll give
the audience a pen. They can fill in their own.

- No! No, no.

I work for Claude.
There's a barber downstairs.

Never.

If she sees a good-looking

What do you mean, “good-looking
younger man"?. I'm not in the grave! God.

266
00:18:03,948 --> 00:18:06,382
All right, all right. Forget
"good-looking younger man."

she was having an affair?.
- Not Daniella. No, no.

00:18:10,288 --> 00:18:14,520
Forget Daniella. But say hypothetically
you're married to a beautiful young woman.

- And she's having an affair.
- Not Daniella.

No, no, no, no, no.
Not Daniella. Daniella's out.

This is a new woman.
Hypothetical. She's having an affair.

- Would you want to know?.
- Norman, are you trying to tell me something?.

00:18:25,036 --> 00:18:28,904
Because the hair on the back
of my neck's starting to creep.

Listen, I'm sorry I ever used Daniella.
The woman's nuts about you.

She's crazy. I've never seen
a woman so much in love.

276
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:36,841
It's just a question. I was at a party,
they asked this question.

“You're married to a beautiful woman, she's
having an affair-- would you want to know??'

I'm-- Hypothetically, no, because,
if-if she was, then I'd want to know who...

280
00:18:49,193 --> 00:18:51,889
and when and where, and-- oh.

281
00:18:51,963 --> 00:18:54,193
- No, I wouldn't. Would you want to know?.
- No, no, no.

282
00:18:54,265 --> 00:18:56,927
I think there are things in life
that are better left unknown.

00:18:57,001 --> 00:18:58,935
- What's that?.
- What?.

- You just dropped this.
Did you mean to drop this?.
- I dropped nothing.

You just dropped this envelope in here.
Did you mean to drop it?.

What?. Oh, it's a report.

- I threw it away. It's nothing.
- What report?.

00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:12,874
The mix-up with Giuseppe. The investigator.
This is his report. I threw it away.
