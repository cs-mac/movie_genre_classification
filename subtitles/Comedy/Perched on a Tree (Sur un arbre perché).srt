1
00:00:08,647 --> 00:00:11,102
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

2
00:00:11,103 --> 00:00:13,263
In this period of economic growth...

3
00:00:13,265 --> 00:00:17,277
...the construction of a European
highway network...

4
00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:19,174
...is very relevant.

5
00:00:19,821 --> 00:00:23,091
Mr Roubier, the well-known
French representative...

6
00:00:23,093 --> 00:00:26,623
...has joined us to elaborate
on his views regarding this matter.

7
00:00:27,068 --> 00:00:29,093
Mr Roubier, please tell us...

8
00:00:29,094 --> 00:00:33,682
...whether you will also negotiate with
the Italians about this contract.

9
00:00:34,516 --> 00:00:38,067
No, sir. A French company
is already on it.

10
00:00:38,069 --> 00:00:42,867
And I'm not in the habit of
thwarting my competitors.

11
00:00:44,115 --> 00:00:46,597
Will you limit yourself to France?

12
00:00:46,972 --> 00:00:49,601
Yes, and I'm proud of it, sir.

13
00:00:49,602 --> 00:00:55,243
For this project,
people will have to be evicted.

14
00:00:55,244 --> 00:00:59,035
Or is that a rumour?
-I know what you're trying to say.

15
00:00:59,037 --> 00:01:03,283
A couple of bungalows
won't stop progress.

16
00:01:03,284 --> 00:01:08,037
I think general interest is more
important than private interest.

17
00:01:11,477 --> 00:01:15,473
In the meantime, in San Remo,
in contrast with what he said...

18
00:01:15,474 --> 00:01:20,862
...Henri Roubier, the opportunistic
business man...

19
00:01:20,863 --> 00:01:23,591
...stole from his competitor,
Lejeune & Co., the order...

20
00:01:23,592 --> 00:01:25,962
...for the construction of a
European highway network.

21
00:01:25,963 --> 00:01:32,004
In his usual discrete and
energetic manner...

22
00:01:32,005 --> 00:01:33,813
...he secretly obtained...

23
00:01:33,814 --> 00:01:37,650
...the approval of initiator
Enrico Mazzini.

24
00:01:37,651 --> 00:01:40,482
This news just came in...

25
00:01:40,483 --> 00:01:44,026
Highways: customs personnel
continue their protests.

26
00:01:44,392 --> 00:01:47,792
We'll discuss this in our studio with...

27
00:01:47,927 --> 00:01:51,494
...Mr Lejeune and his partners.

28
00:01:51,496 --> 00:01:55,849
They will inform us about their project
to build a European highway network.

29
00:01:56,557 --> 00:02:01,314
When will you negotiate with
Mr Mazzini?

30
00:02:01,315 --> 00:02:02,603
Right away.

31
00:02:02,604 --> 00:02:04,362
Since Roubier, our competitor...

32
00:02:04,363 --> 00:02:07,397
...was good enough to retire
from this project.

33
00:02:07,683 --> 00:02:09,780
At the first opportunity we'll get...

34
00:02:09,781 --> 00:02:14,475
...we'll show him how grateful we are.

35
00:02:57,049 --> 00:03:03,999
PERCHED ON A TREE

36
00:05:05,123 --> 00:05:06,969
Bastard.

37
00:05:08,396 --> 00:05:10,506
Bastard.

38
00:05:16,578 --> 00:05:18,387
What's that?

39
00:05:18,388 --> 00:05:20,251
What's happening?

40
00:05:21,259 --> 00:05:23,538
What's going on?
Wait a minute.

41
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:27,280
What's happening?
-The truck drivers are on strike.

42
00:05:36,524 --> 00:05:38,837
Why are you on strike?

43
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:41,659
We're protesting against the customs
officers, because they're on strike.

44
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:45,917
So what?
-They're on strike because we are.

45
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:50,235
What are you doing?

46
00:05:50,494 --> 00:05:52,082
What are you doing?

47
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:55,324
Come on, get out.
-Wait, I need to have a rest.

48
00:05:55,325 --> 00:05:57,734
You tried to run me over.
-What?

49
00:05:57,735 --> 00:06:00,667
You almost did.
-Come on, out!

50
00:06:00,668 --> 00:06:02,934
Attempted murder, premeditated.

51
00:06:02,935 --> 00:06:04,381
The police will take this
very seriously.

52
00:06:04,382 --> 00:06:06,023
What?
-Where are you going?

53
00:06:06,024 --> 00:06:09,280
Out.
-No need to tell me.

54
00:06:10,133 --> 00:06:12,402
I love surprises.

55
00:06:35,771 --> 00:06:38,155
Oh sir, that's great.

56
00:06:38,156 --> 00:06:42,199
Your friend told me everything.
I don't know how to thank you.

57
00:06:46,757 --> 00:06:48,820
So you're going to Cassis as well?

58
00:06:48,821 --> 00:06:52,662
I'm not going to Cassis at all.
-Yes, you are. Remember? Cassis?

59
00:06:52,663 --> 00:06:55,914
I'm not going to Cassis.
-Yes, you are, You are.

60
00:06:56,218 --> 00:06:58,279
Not at all. Oh no...

61
00:07:05,038 --> 00:07:08,342
You'll say it's bad but
it's stronger than me.

62
00:07:08,343 --> 00:07:10,182
When I want to gamble, I have to do it.

63
00:07:10,183 --> 00:07:13,269
My husband forbids me to go
to any of the casinos in France.

64
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:16,436
So I'm using this opportunity to go
on a business trip to San Remo.

65
00:07:16,437 --> 00:07:17,778
Serves him right.

66
00:07:17,779 --> 00:07:20,614
Forbids! Forbidding
should be forbidden.

67
00:07:20,615 --> 00:07:23,340
Cut it out.
-My husband's very old-fashioned.

68
00:07:23,341 --> 00:07:26,182
He's wrong. Life's one big game.

69
00:07:26,582 --> 00:07:29,107
It's a matter of being
lucky or not.

70
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:33,035
What do you say, Mr Roubier?
-Are you Roubier? How terrible.

71
00:07:34,795 --> 00:07:37,820
An industrialist like you.
A politician.

72
00:07:37,822 --> 00:07:41,811
You presented your own book on TV:
"I Did It On My Own".

73
00:07:41,812 --> 00:07:44,405
It was ridiculous and
pompous.

74
00:07:45,022 --> 00:07:46,582
Nobody does it on their own.

75
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:50,157
In life, you're lucky or unlucky.

76
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:52,578
Life's about making an effort.

77
00:07:53,667 --> 00:07:55,333
Will power...

78
00:07:55,334 --> 00:07:57,261
...work.

79
00:07:58,221 --> 00:08:00,797
There's no such thing as bad luck.

80
00:08:52,001 --> 00:08:54,129
Hello, sir.

81
00:08:57,567 --> 00:08:59,894
Hello, sir.
-Who are you?

82
00:08:59,895 --> 00:09:02,095
I don't know. And you?

83
00:09:02,096 --> 00:09:03,515
I don't know.

84
00:09:03,517 --> 00:09:07,462
But what are you doing in my bed?
-I don't know.

85
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:10,542
And what's she doing here?
She's also in my bed.

86
00:09:11,757 --> 00:09:15,604
Is she your wife?
-No, she's your wife.

87
00:09:16,756 --> 00:09:19,257
No, my wife is like this...

88
00:09:19,293 --> 00:09:21,759
But what are you two doing in my bed?

89
00:09:24,813 --> 00:09:26,531
That's mine.

90
00:09:26,632 --> 00:09:28,446
I say.

91
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:32,707
But where are we?
Where are we?

92
00:09:33,734 --> 00:09:36,212
Where are we?

93
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:40,372
We were driving on the road.
-How do you know?

94
00:09:40,422 --> 00:09:42,781
The bend.

95
00:09:42,981 --> 00:09:47,228
Yes, I remember.
The bend. I went like this...

96
00:09:48,675 --> 00:09:52,224
What a fright. What a fright.

97
00:09:53,074 --> 00:09:54,851
You're right.

98
00:09:54,852 --> 00:09:58,541
Do you think... I'm crazy
to ask you...

99
00:09:58,542 --> 00:10:01,717
...but we're not dead, do you think?

100
00:10:01,719 --> 00:10:03,443
I don't think so.

101
00:10:03,572 --> 00:10:05,724
Then I don't understand.

102
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:09,155
Where are we? Where?

103
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:20,129
Where on earth are we?
I'll have a look.

104
00:10:34,452 --> 00:10:38,995
Don't move. Don't move.
This is dangerous.

105
00:10:38,996 --> 00:10:41,350
Is it me or are we swaying?

106
00:10:41,351 --> 00:10:43,619
We're balancing.

107
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:46,240
We're swaying a lot.

108
00:10:46,496 --> 00:10:48,754
Where on earth are we?

109
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,587
What shall we do?

110
00:10:51,786 --> 00:10:53,816
What shall we do?

111
00:10:54,883 --> 00:10:58,733
No, we were doing fine.
Don't move. Don't move.

112
00:10:58,734 --> 00:11:02,577
Never mind. We're alright like this.
We shouldn't ask for too much.

113
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,909
Now what do we do?

114
00:11:06,438 --> 00:11:09,518
It's best to wait until
daylight.

115
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:12,398
And most of all, let's not move.

116
00:11:13,206 --> 00:11:15,036
Don't move an inch.

117
00:11:15,983 --> 00:11:18,969
Don't move.
-No, no. It's cold.

118
00:11:23,246 --> 00:11:25,152
There's a draft.

119
00:12:43,486 --> 00:12:45,304
What are you doing?

120
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:49,301
Very carefully. Don't move.

121
00:12:50,275 --> 00:12:55,235
Like that. No, no.
Don't move.

122
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:33,484
We landed on a tree.
We landed on a tree.

123
00:13:34,283 --> 00:13:37,098
It's better to land on a tree
than to hit it.

124
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:42,164
See that luck exists?

125
00:13:48,356 --> 00:13:50,514
You're right.

126
00:13:50,515 --> 00:13:53,357
As long as the mistral doesn't start.

127
00:14:13,157 --> 00:14:14,643
God bless.

128
00:14:14,644 --> 00:14:17,949
Thank you.
-I didn't say that for you.

129
00:14:28,548 --> 00:14:32,520
When she wakes up, we'll
have to be very careful.

130
00:14:33,907 --> 00:14:36,386
What shall we tell her?

131
00:14:36,387 --> 00:14:39,066
That we wanted to enjoy
the view.

132
00:14:41,852 --> 00:14:43,736
Do you hear that?

133
00:14:47,923 --> 00:14:49,990
They're looking for us.

134
00:15:04,314 --> 00:15:06,347
Stupid animal.

135
00:15:10,756 --> 00:15:13,757
Here, here. No, not there.

136
00:15:34,348 --> 00:15:36,123
Are we there yet?

137
00:15:40,026 --> 00:15:42,142
Did we arrive?

138
00:15:42,459 --> 00:15:45,485
Yes, we're just getting out.

139
00:15:45,682 --> 00:15:47,410
Quidou?

140
00:15:48,082 --> 00:15:49,657
But Quidou.
-I'll go there.

141
00:15:49,658 --> 00:15:51,155
What are you doing there?

142
00:15:51,389 --> 00:15:52,699
My poor Quidou.

143
00:15:53,938 --> 00:15:56,179
What are you doing there?

144
00:16:28,066 --> 00:16:30,875
I want to get out!
I want to go!

145
00:16:30,876 --> 00:16:34,495
I want to get out.

146
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:52,645
Who are you?
-It's me. Don't you recognise me?

147
00:16:52,646 --> 00:16:57,041
No.
-Look, look. See?

148
00:16:59,604 --> 00:17:02,596
No, it's him.
Still the same.

149
00:17:02,597 --> 00:17:05,212
It's him. There.

150
00:17:08,796 --> 00:17:10,720
Quidou?

151
00:17:10,721 --> 00:17:14,357
Quidou?

152
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:16,820
Where is he?
-Quidou?

153
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:55,282
It was so quiet here.
Let her be.

154
00:17:55,283 --> 00:17:59,037
She'll calm down.
-What do you mean, calm?

155
00:18:00,098 --> 00:18:03,526
Yes, she'll calm down.
-Of course she will.

156
00:18:03,527 --> 00:18:06,667
Have you got something to drink?
-Yes, water.

157
00:18:17,238 --> 00:18:21,258
Now he's going nuts.
Calm down. Calm down.

158
00:18:23,614 --> 00:18:27,051
Calm down, please.
You're not leaving, are you?

159
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:35,323
The water.

160
00:18:40,141 --> 00:18:43,785
Calming, relaxing.

161
00:18:43,786 --> 00:18:47,974
The ideal remedy for
the overwrought business man.

162
00:19:00,109 --> 00:19:03,755
Yes, I'm going.

163
00:19:12,915 --> 00:19:14,369
What happened to me?

164
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:17,132
Nothing, you just fainted.
Nothing serious.

165
00:19:17,133 --> 00:19:21,601
Drink this. It'll do you good.
You'll see.

166
00:19:23,394 --> 00:19:24,726
Where are we?

167
00:19:24,727 --> 00:19:26,234
We're here.

168
00:19:26,235 --> 00:19:28,911
Everyone's here.

169
00:19:36,786 --> 00:19:38,611
Feeling better?

170
00:19:38,817 --> 00:19:40,894
Oh, yes.

171
00:19:41,108 --> 00:19:44,206
Really?
-Oh, yes.

172
00:19:44,979 --> 00:19:47,621
You're taking a nap.

173
00:19:48,619 --> 00:19:52,673
So we have some peace and quiet.

174
00:19:54,852 --> 00:19:57,766
Right, since the car's
quite stable...

175
00:19:57,767 --> 00:20:00,698
...let's think about what
our options are.

176
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:04,020
Every problem has a solution,
every solution...

177
00:20:04,021 --> 00:20:08,715
So we could just stay here
and starve to death.

178
00:20:08,716 --> 00:20:12,204
No, somebody important like you.
It would be noticed.

179
00:20:12,205 --> 00:20:13,780
They're looking for you right now.

180
00:20:13,782 --> 00:20:17,028
That's impossible, because I was
travelling incognito.

181
00:20:17,029 --> 00:20:19,213
I was working on a billion
dollar deal.

182
00:20:19,214 --> 00:20:21,166
And now you're on a tree.

183
00:20:24,003 --> 00:20:25,916
I'm meeting the minister
at 11 am.

184
00:20:25,917 --> 00:20:28,725
What time is it now?
Oh, there's plenty of time.

185
00:20:29,108 --> 00:20:32,100
I'm getting out. I'm going.
-This belongs to you.

186
00:20:32,452 --> 00:20:34,625
What's that?
-It belongs to you.

187
00:20:34,626 --> 00:20:37,937
Oh, yes, it does.
It's mine.

188
00:20:45,816 --> 00:20:50,618
Help! Help!

189
00:20:52,843 --> 00:20:55,894
Help!

190
00:20:59,114 --> 00:21:02,136
Help!

191
00:21:03,979 --> 00:21:07,202
Help!

192
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:38,270
Hot record!
-Where?

193
00:21:38,271 --> 00:21:40,952
Is the car getting hot?

194
00:21:53,254 --> 00:21:56,123
Do you want to dance?
-She's gone insane.

195
00:22:05,678 --> 00:22:08,266
What's hot? Stop, stop.

196
00:22:08,267 --> 00:22:10,237
It's breaking.

197
00:22:18,681 --> 00:22:23,201
Look, look. This is a disaster.
This is a disaster.

198
00:22:23,397 --> 00:22:26,227
How do you want to get out?
What a disaster.

199
00:22:26,228 --> 00:22:28,710
We're doomed.

200
00:22:28,711 --> 00:22:31,138
The truth is we're already dead.

201
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:35,248
No, come here.
Reality's here. There.

202
00:22:38,351 --> 00:22:40,599
Oh, how beautiful!

203
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:43,715
This is magnificent.

204
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:48,997
Come, let's fly.
I'll fly.

205
00:22:48,999 --> 00:22:51,635
What are you doing?
I'll smack you.

206
00:22:51,636 --> 00:22:54,274
Sit down. I'll smack you.
-Why?

207
00:22:54,275 --> 00:22:55,982
We're not going to fly.
-But you're all...

208
00:22:55,983 --> 00:22:58,402
That's it for today.

209
00:22:58,403 --> 00:23:01,245
You stay here. Like it or not.
With us.

210
00:23:01,246 --> 00:23:03,029
You're not very nice.

211
00:23:03,031 --> 00:23:05,539
You won't let me do anything.
-I'll smack you.

212
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:08,803
I can't dance,
I can't fly.

213
00:23:09,012 --> 00:23:11,618
I woke up for nothing.

214
00:23:23,973 --> 00:23:27,828
Listen, now that we're a bit
stable again...

215
00:23:27,829 --> 00:23:33,339
Hey, do you have to do that?
Be patient. Not right away.

216
00:23:34,308 --> 00:23:38,724
No, or else I leave.
Choose. She or me.

217
00:23:41,518 --> 00:23:45,269
Listen, now that we're
a bit stable again...

218
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:48,262
...we need to think about
what we're going to do.

219
00:23:48,263 --> 00:23:52,347
Each problem has its solution,
each solution...

220
00:23:52,348 --> 00:23:57,397
I already know. We can
only wait and starve to death.

221
00:24:07,869 --> 00:24:10,118
For me, for me.
-No.

222
00:24:11,195 --> 00:24:13,627
Enough.
-Thanks.

223
00:24:13,864 --> 00:24:14,866
For me, for me.

224
00:24:14,867 --> 00:24:16,725
Sir, I'm sorry about earlier.

225
00:24:16,726 --> 00:24:20,966
You couldn't know, but I'm
a very sensitive woman.

226
00:24:20,967 --> 00:24:25,412
Suddenly finding yourself on top
of a parasol is a shock.

227
00:24:25,413 --> 00:24:28,620
It's alright.
-I'm calm again.

228
00:24:28,621 --> 00:24:31,312
I even feel fine.

229
00:24:31,313 --> 00:24:34,772
I think this adventure
is quite poetic.

230
00:24:59,004 --> 00:25:01,897
Anyway, I don't regret
a thing.

231
00:25:02,297 --> 00:25:04,068
Me neither.

232
00:25:04,069 --> 00:25:07,093
Really, not at all.
-Quidou, Quidou, he ate everything.

233
00:25:07,094 --> 00:25:09,793
He ate everything. Good.
-That's not so bad, is it?

234
00:25:09,794 --> 00:25:13,998
There he is. Smack him.
-Yes, right.

235
00:25:37,636 --> 00:25:39,896
Good.

236
00:25:42,514 --> 00:25:45,892
I hope your husband's
not worried.

237
00:25:45,893 --> 00:25:49,106
He thinks I'm cheating anyway.

238
00:25:49,107 --> 00:25:52,787
He won't believe I spent the
night in a tree.

239
00:25:54,615 --> 00:25:56,810
Is he jealous?

240
00:25:57,099 --> 00:26:00,151
Oh là là. No, he's
an admirable man.

241
00:26:00,152 --> 00:26:03,163
But I don't like him.
He's a bit like you.

242
00:26:03,165 --> 00:26:05,631
Well, I say.
-Yes.

243
00:26:05,633 --> 00:26:09,051
He's very ambitious, but he has
no sense of humour. Just like you.

244
00:26:09,053 --> 00:26:10,304
I beg your pardon.

245
00:26:10,305 --> 00:26:12,556
I only saw my husband laugh once.

246
00:26:12,557 --> 00:26:16,484
Yes, I saw him laugh on TV.

247
00:26:16,717 --> 00:26:19,344
It was about your election campaign.

248
00:26:19,346 --> 00:26:22,983
Have you gone mad?
-It was about your election campaign.

249
00:26:23,669 --> 00:26:25,115
I'm leaving.

250
00:26:25,117 --> 00:26:29,516
We were cracking up and forgot all
about the movie they showed afterwards.

251
00:26:29,517 --> 00:26:32,016
I'm leaving.

252
00:26:33,107 --> 00:26:34,741
He was great.

253
00:26:34,743 --> 00:26:37,233
Did you see it too?

254
00:26:42,206 --> 00:26:45,262
Don't get angry.

255
00:27:26,226 --> 00:27:28,365
What happened to
Henri Roubier?

256
00:27:28,366 --> 00:27:30,188
That's a mystery at the moment.

257
00:27:30,189 --> 00:27:34,524
Was he so overworked that
he lost his memory?

258
00:27:34,525 --> 00:27:38,534
Has he gone insane?

259
00:27:38,773 --> 00:27:41,218
Did he commit suicide?

260
00:27:41,571 --> 00:27:45,325
Did he work for a foreign power?

261
00:27:46,486 --> 00:27:50,109
What an idiot.
-Has he been kidnapped?

262
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:56,417
We interviewed Mrs Rombier
at her home.

263
00:27:56,418 --> 00:27:58,013
Mrs Rombier?

264
00:27:58,014 --> 00:28:01,514
I just know my husband hasn't
strayed from the right path.

265
00:28:01,515 --> 00:28:06,438
His name is not on any list
of traffic victims...

266
00:28:06,439 --> 00:28:08,620
...so I came to the conclusion
that he has been kidnapped.

267
00:28:09,846 --> 00:28:12,219
Whoever you are...

268
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:14,758
...I forgive you.

269
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:17,940
But I beg you to
spare my husband's life.

270
00:28:18,955 --> 00:28:21,114
Give him back to us alive.

271
00:28:21,115 --> 00:28:22,533
I'm still alive.

272
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:25,980
No matter what the ransom is...

273
00:28:25,981 --> 00:28:27,486
...we'll pay it.

274
00:28:27,487 --> 00:28:29,646
Oh, no. Don't pay!

275
00:28:29,647 --> 00:28:32,341
Henri Roubier. Yes, a man
who did everything on his own.

276
00:28:32,342 --> 00:28:34,949
In a time when many authors
produce hollow words...

277
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:39,460
...Henri Roubier's message
spoke of actions.

278
00:28:39,461 --> 00:28:43,270
I Did It On My Own,
a real manual for success...

279
00:28:43,271 --> 00:28:46,036
...was awarded because of its
effectiveness.

280
00:28:46,037 --> 00:28:49,499
I Did It On My Own is about
a man who started with nothing.

281
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:53,660
The author says: Yes, I
started with nothing.

282
00:28:53,989 --> 00:28:59,851
I started as a cyclist. This sport
teaches you to be energetic.

283
00:28:59,852 --> 00:29:03,290
A lesson in loyalty and fair play.

284
00:29:03,476 --> 00:29:06,294
Sport stimulates the
noble side of people.

285
00:29:06,295 --> 00:29:10,371
It teaches you to act
without cheating.

286
00:29:10,518 --> 00:29:12,694
My life as a business man...

287
00:29:12,695 --> 00:29:16,195
...was always a reflection of
my sports career.

288
00:29:16,196 --> 00:29:18,235
What a report.

289
00:29:18,236 --> 00:29:22,142
Henri Roubier married rich banker's
daughter Marval de Beaufort.

290
00:29:22,143 --> 00:29:24,861
This beautiful love story
incited a lot of jealousy.

291
00:29:24,862 --> 00:29:27,921
Roubier says that
money isn't everything...

292
00:29:27,922 --> 00:29:32,542
...but that it should also not be an
obstacle for a lover and business man.

293
00:29:43,266 --> 00:29:47,326
He quickly made fame as the
self-made man of asphalt.

294
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:51,717
My first highway was
my first victory, wrote Roubier.

295
00:30:25,236 --> 00:30:29,763
Of course, Henri Roubier
went into politics.

296
00:30:29,764 --> 00:30:33,565
I'm not in politics to do
business, but...

297
00:30:33,566 --> 00:30:37,988
...to defend freedom.

298
00:30:37,989 --> 00:30:42,613
I speak to you in the name of freedom,
neither from the right, nor from the left.

299
00:30:42,614 --> 00:30:45,827
I belong to no party.

300
00:30:45,828 --> 00:30:47,660
For me, there is only one party...

301
00:30:47,661 --> 00:30:51,614
...France. And France, that's you.
Everyone who's listening.

302
00:30:51,615 --> 00:30:54,923
But there is no freedom
without highways...

303
00:30:54,925 --> 00:30:58,439
...I mean without authority.

304
00:30:58,816 --> 00:31:00,686
Did you see that?

305
00:31:01,101 --> 00:31:02,714
The latest news.

306
00:31:02,715 --> 00:31:07,245
The escaped maniac, nicknamed
the Camping Vampire...

307
00:31:07,246 --> 00:31:09,174
...has not yet been arrested.

308
00:31:09,318 --> 00:31:12,163
Entertainment. We end this
news broadcast...

309
00:31:12,164 --> 00:31:14,579
...with a scene from Vlasko
Briski's latest movie...

310
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:16,071
'Waltz of the Vampire'.

311
00:31:16,072 --> 00:31:18,176
It's currently being shown in
cinemas in Paris.

312
00:31:18,177 --> 00:31:22,025
This film is not suited
for young viewers.

313
00:31:25,795 --> 00:31:29,546
I might have picked him up
on the highway.

314
00:31:31,701 --> 00:31:34,618
Just my luck.

315
00:36:03,316 --> 00:36:05,589
Good to see you again.

316
00:36:10,235 --> 00:36:13,225
They're still there.

317
00:36:14,619 --> 00:36:17,823
We're quite comfortable here.

318
00:36:31,747 --> 00:36:33,817
Quite comfortable.

319
00:36:48,181 --> 00:36:49,997
A boat.

320
00:36:49,998 --> 00:36:51,546
A boat.
-Where?

321
00:36:51,547 --> 00:36:54,077
There!

322
00:36:54,078 --> 00:36:56,484
A boat.

323
00:37:37,237 --> 00:37:41,459
I've got it. Don't move anymore.

324
00:38:44,227 --> 00:38:46,554
This can't have done that.

325
00:39:02,188 --> 00:39:04,180
My God.

326
00:39:06,774 --> 00:39:09,922
"Much later..."

327
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:32,835
We're doomed.
We're all doomed.

328
00:39:35,402 --> 00:39:38,326
Don't you have anything more to drink?

329
00:39:44,493 --> 00:39:46,614
Anything to eat?

330
00:39:56,695 --> 00:39:59,214
Such a full backpack.

331
00:41:12,525 --> 00:41:16,390
We're dying. We're dying.

332
00:41:18,694 --> 00:41:21,399
Not at all. Not at all.

333
00:41:23,152 --> 00:41:27,947
In India, there are yogis
who don't eat...

334
00:41:27,948 --> 00:41:31,684
...for forty days.
Nothing.

335
00:41:32,470 --> 00:41:35,669
Yes, but they're trained for it.

336
00:41:37,093 --> 00:41:39,057
Maybe.

337
00:41:47,571 --> 00:41:50,375
He's nice and chubby.

338
00:41:52,867 --> 00:41:55,849
This monster wants
to eat my dog.

339
00:43:57,292 --> 00:43:59,323
Good...

340
00:43:59,324 --> 00:44:02,700
...at least I can do some
sunbathing.

341
00:44:03,179 --> 00:44:05,762
I'll die with a nice tan.

342
00:44:11,285 --> 00:44:12,675
Am I giving you any ideas?

343
00:44:12,676 --> 00:44:15,698
Yes, I have an idea.

344
00:44:15,699 --> 00:44:16,809
We're saved.

345
00:44:16,810 --> 00:44:20,698
We're saved. We're saved.

346
00:44:44,398 --> 00:44:46,778
Look. See that tree?
-Which tree?

347
00:44:46,779 --> 00:44:51,998
The tree right underneath us.
If we can get there, we're safe.

348
00:44:51,999 --> 00:44:55,579
Because then we can go
down via those trees.

349
00:44:56,165 --> 00:44:57,994
Did my sunbathing give
you that idea?

350
00:44:57,995 --> 00:45:02,338
Yes, we'll make a rope by
tying our clothes together.

351
00:45:02,339 --> 00:45:05,041
That way, we can get
to the first tree.

352
00:45:05,042 --> 00:45:06,948
And after the first tree?
-What after?

353
00:45:06,950 --> 00:45:09,981
Then we can climb from tree to tree.

354
00:45:09,982 --> 00:45:12,636
And then we'll be free.
Come on.

355
00:45:17,708 --> 00:45:22,081
We're saved. We're saved.

356
00:47:34,791 --> 00:47:36,945
Climb back up.

357
00:48:15,508 --> 00:48:18,573
Good to see you again.

358
00:48:18,574 --> 00:48:20,338
You saved my life.

359
00:48:20,339 --> 00:48:22,030
It was a reflex.

360
00:48:22,987 --> 00:48:25,614
Anyway, that proves
you're not him.

361
00:48:25,615 --> 00:48:29,141
That he's someone else.

362
00:48:29,878 --> 00:48:32,699
Good to see you again.

363
00:48:34,267 --> 00:48:36,430
My skirt.

364
00:48:39,278 --> 00:48:42,732
If they find us half naked
in your car...

365
00:48:42,733 --> 00:48:45,055
...what would my husband think?

366
00:48:48,590 --> 00:48:50,764
He's able to kill all three
of us.

367
00:48:50,765 --> 00:48:54,787
Oh no, I'm sure your husband's very nice.

368
00:48:55,814 --> 00:48:57,834
Very gentle.

369
00:48:59,581 --> 00:49:04,052
He must be a poet. Very nice.

370
00:49:04,053 --> 00:49:06,661
I'd like to meet him
if I'll still be alive.

371
00:49:06,662 --> 00:49:09,510
Ex colonel Müller, husband of
the woman who disappeared...

372
00:49:09,511 --> 00:49:12,974
...is apparently being charged.

373
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:16,987
Ex colonel Müller is charged with placing
a bomb near the TV station...

374
00:49:16,988 --> 00:49:20,139
...that linked the disappearance
of his wife...

375
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:22,237
...to industrial Henri Roubier.

376
00:49:22,238 --> 00:49:24,431
Well, I'll be!

377
00:49:24,432 --> 00:49:26,772
See? I wasn't exaggerating.

378
00:49:26,773 --> 00:49:29,434
If you want, I can testify.
-What, testify?

379
00:49:29,435 --> 00:49:32,748
Get the bazooka.
-Cut it out.

380
00:49:38,735 --> 00:49:41,590
If your husband saw us...

381
00:49:41,592 --> 00:49:45,180
We're again talking about the
highways of Gascony.

382
00:49:45,723 --> 00:49:48,789
Mr Lejeune of Lejeune & Co...

383
00:49:48,790 --> 00:49:51,725
...is shocked by the disappearance of
Henri Roubier.

384
00:49:51,726 --> 00:49:54,614
And he assures us that he'll
do all he can...

385
00:49:54,615 --> 00:49:57,775
...to solve this mystery.

386
00:50:52,388 --> 00:50:56,690
A psychic told me I'll die
at the age of 80.

387
00:51:02,159 --> 00:51:04,594
That leaves two possibilities.

388
00:51:04,595 --> 00:51:07,366
Either you're older than you look...

389
00:51:07,367 --> 00:51:11,974
...or the psychic wasn't good at math.

390
00:51:12,206 --> 00:51:14,427
Waiter.

391
00:51:14,428 --> 00:51:17,004
A big glass of water...

392
00:51:17,005 --> 00:51:19,200
...with ice cubes.

393
00:53:17,296 --> 00:53:21,525
Thirsty?
-Perrier

394
00:53:57,837 --> 00:54:02,527
St. Peter, good St. Peter.

395
00:54:14,655 --> 00:54:16,902
Thank you, St. Peter.

396
00:55:21,124 --> 00:55:24,079
Quickly. We have to get
rid of the water.

397
00:56:02,557 --> 00:56:04,598
A bottle in the ocean.
-Where?

398
00:56:04,599 --> 00:56:06,890
No, this bottle. Look.

399
00:56:06,891 --> 00:56:10,547
I'll throw it in with an SOS.

400
00:56:10,548 --> 00:56:13,360
It'll break on the rocks.

401
00:58:14,886 --> 00:58:19,323
Alright, that makes three bottles.
-No, two.

402
00:58:19,475 --> 00:58:23,109
Sorry, but I can count to three.

403
00:58:23,327 --> 00:58:26,170
We only had two.
-And that one?

404
00:58:26,171 --> 00:58:27,851
Listen...
-What, listen?

405
00:58:27,852 --> 00:58:31,323
It's empty, so it was full.
-That doesn't prove anything.

406
00:58:31,324 --> 00:58:35,981
That proves the bottle was
emptied, drunk.

407
00:58:35,982 --> 00:58:38,420
And if it was drunk,
it has to be paid.

408
00:58:38,421 --> 00:58:43,114
Officer, come here please.

409
00:58:43,115 --> 00:58:45,854
I have a small problem with this
gentleman and this lady.

410
00:58:45,856 --> 00:58:49,637
How many bottles do
you see on the table?

411
00:58:54,797 --> 00:58:57,675
Three.

412
00:58:58,717 --> 00:59:03,198
The third one landed with a parachute.
-With a parachute?

413
00:59:03,199 --> 00:59:05,431
With a parachute.

414
00:59:05,432 --> 00:59:08,545
And you'll land at the police station.

415
00:59:30,499 --> 00:59:34,055
It's my car. It went off the road.

416
00:59:34,703 --> 00:59:36,544
In a bend.

417
00:59:39,309 --> 00:59:41,549
Landed on a parasol.

418
00:59:42,700 --> 00:59:45,404
At one kilometre of Cassis.

419
00:59:45,718 --> 00:59:47,903
Good heavens.

420
00:59:50,227 --> 00:59:52,462
I'm warning you.
If this is a hoax...

421
00:59:52,463 --> 00:59:57,470
...you won't have a sunstroke
at the end of your holiday.

422
01:00:11,732 --> 01:00:14,567
There! Up there!

423
01:00:22,405 --> 01:00:25,742
Look, they're all naked.

424
01:00:25,940 --> 01:00:29,161
Come on. Come.

425
01:00:43,675 --> 01:00:47,724
I'll have to inform the chief.

426
01:01:02,682 --> 01:01:04,669
There. There.

427
01:02:16,386 --> 01:02:20,653
When I received your message,
I was on duty of course.

428
01:02:21,596 --> 01:02:25,121
I found the message and then...

429
01:02:25,444 --> 01:02:28,312
You should know how happy we were.

430
01:02:30,219 --> 01:02:33,841
I came closer and I saw
them and I said...

431
01:02:33,842 --> 01:02:36,482
...we have to warn everybody.

432
01:02:47,940 --> 01:02:51,907
Henri Roubier and the wife
of ex colonel Müller...

433
01:02:51,908 --> 01:02:54,812
...had their love nest on the Côte d'Azur.

434
01:02:57,214 --> 01:03:00,068
Excuse me.

435
01:03:04,436 --> 01:03:08,306
We're going live to our
colleagues in Marseille.

436
01:03:08,307 --> 01:03:10,682
I'm at the location of the event.
What a tragedy.

437
01:03:10,683 --> 01:03:15,411
It's terrible. A car on a tree.
You should see it.

438
01:03:15,412 --> 01:03:18,394
You should see it. You should see it.

439
01:03:19,589 --> 01:03:24,156
Hello Marseille. What's happening?
I get no more video.

440
01:03:26,886 --> 01:03:29,613
Alright. It's coming back.
I have video again.

441
01:03:29,614 --> 01:03:33,273
Important business man Henri Roubier
was found half naked...

442
01:03:33,274 --> 01:03:35,291
...with the wife of ex colonel Müller...

443
01:03:35,292 --> 01:03:38,477
...in a car, hanging on a tree.

444
01:03:38,478 --> 01:03:40,546
In the company of a
mysterious man.

445
01:03:40,547 --> 01:03:44,997
Which strange event were they returning
from, so scantily dressed?

446
01:03:45,294 --> 01:03:48,380
Henri Roubier is an excellent driver.
If he lost control at this point...

447
01:03:48,381 --> 01:03:50,736
...he was probably not sober.

448
01:03:53,069 --> 01:03:55,427
Operation Parasol has just started.

449
01:03:55,428 --> 01:03:59,660
I'm told that Operation
Parasol is commencing.

450
01:03:59,661 --> 01:04:00,899
Stay with us and listen.

451
01:04:00,900 --> 01:04:06,771
Hello, hello. Operation
Parasol has started.

452
01:04:07,122 --> 01:04:09,883
Keep your spirits up.
We're coming.

453
01:04:10,559 --> 01:04:12,565
Thanks.

454
01:04:12,641 --> 01:04:15,506
Dear viewers, I'll pass
the microphone.

455
01:04:15,507 --> 01:04:20,063
I've just been told that special experts...

456
01:04:20,064 --> 01:04:22,856
...have arrived in the studio...

457
01:04:22,857 --> 01:04:25,493
...to provide commentary
for Operation Parasol.

458
01:04:25,494 --> 01:04:28,494
Back to Marseille.
-Are they really as good as dead?

459
01:04:29,082 --> 01:04:30,755
I'm afraid so.

460
01:04:31,661 --> 01:04:38,013
The rocks are steep there and
the tree roots have come out in part.

461
01:04:39,101 --> 01:04:43,356
Can't they lower the swing and
get them up one by one?

462
01:04:43,357 --> 01:04:46,795
No, that's no way to
save them.

463
01:04:46,796 --> 01:04:50,580
Why not? Idiot.
-You're about to be rescued.

464
01:04:50,581 --> 01:04:54,654
We're having the Super Puma crane
brought over from Martigues.

465
01:04:55,028 --> 01:04:57,976
But it only does 12 kilometres
per hour.

466
01:04:57,977 --> 01:05:01,226
It will be here in 24 hours.

467
01:05:01,854 --> 01:05:07,350
Everything's fine. Don't worry.
We'll get you out.

468
01:05:07,895 --> 01:05:10,550
And that tree? Can it hold
the weight?

469
01:05:12,284 --> 01:05:13,418
Probably not.

470
01:05:13,419 --> 01:05:16,971
Do you think they're lost?
-It looks bad.

471
01:05:16,972 --> 01:05:20,386
I'm not surprised. The engineer
says there's little they can do.

472
01:05:20,387 --> 01:05:22,581
We can believe him.

473
01:05:22,582 --> 01:05:25,802
What a disaster.
-A huge crash.

474
01:05:27,101 --> 01:05:29,412
My God. My God.

475
01:05:29,692 --> 01:05:32,786
Please give us a miracle.

476
01:05:33,291 --> 01:05:37,755
Hello, hello. Mr Henri Roubier.

477
01:05:38,659 --> 01:05:42,353
Your wife wants to speak to you.

478
01:05:48,662 --> 01:05:52,963
It's touching to see how the family
unites over this tragedy.

479
01:05:53,083 --> 01:05:58,149
They show that their emotions
can be bigger than fate.

480
01:05:58,150 --> 01:06:00,439
Even in bad times.

481
01:06:00,846 --> 01:06:05,307
Mrs Roubier reminds us, with
her restrained grieving...

482
01:06:05,308 --> 01:06:08,413
...that real emotion is silent.

483
01:06:08,414 --> 01:06:11,797
Out of respect for her,
we'll now be silent.

484
01:06:12,027 --> 01:06:13,837
Film this.
She's so beautiful.

485
01:06:13,838 --> 01:06:17,859
Look, she's a real Mater Dolorosa,
painted by the young Goya.

486
01:06:17,860 --> 01:06:20,726
Film this. Zoom in on her tears.

487
01:06:23,094 --> 01:06:25,821
Madam, I'll be silent now.

488
01:06:25,822 --> 01:06:28,671
Make sure you get it.

489
01:06:29,283 --> 01:06:32,156
Madam, I'll be silent.

490
01:06:34,506 --> 01:06:36,968
My darling...

491
01:06:36,969 --> 01:06:40,158
Your device isn't working.

492
01:06:40,518 --> 01:06:43,384
One, two, three.

493
01:06:45,475 --> 01:06:49,377
Press this.
-Alright, thank you.

494
01:06:49,907 --> 01:06:52,350
My darling...

495
01:06:52,351 --> 01:06:55,850
...I've found a place
for my sadness.

496
01:06:56,047 --> 01:06:58,965
I can't judge you.

497
01:06:58,966 --> 01:07:00,637
Only God judges.

498
01:07:00,638 --> 01:07:02,662
I'm innocent.

499
01:07:02,663 --> 01:07:04,627
I'm only here...

500
01:07:04,628 --> 01:07:07,107
...to pay respect to your soul.

501
01:07:07,823 --> 01:07:10,638
You may die soon.

502
01:07:10,639 --> 01:07:13,557
And you live in mortal sin.

503
01:07:13,989 --> 01:07:16,148
At dawn...

504
01:07:16,149 --> 01:07:18,299
...I'll send a priest.

505
01:07:18,300 --> 01:07:20,212
No.

506
01:07:20,213 --> 01:07:21,981
My darling.

507
01:07:21,982 --> 01:07:25,075
Goodbye, my darling.

508
01:07:25,251 --> 01:07:27,365
Lucienne.

509
01:07:27,366 --> 01:07:30,235
Lucienne, where are you?

510
01:07:30,536 --> 01:07:33,697
My darling, where are you?

511
01:07:33,954 --> 01:07:36,898
Come down, Lucienne.

512
01:07:52,629 --> 01:07:58,165
Father Jean-Marie Marval de Beaufort
is among those present.

513
01:07:58,227 --> 01:08:00,490
He's accompanied by his sister,
Mrs Roubier.

514
01:08:00,492 --> 01:08:03,305
Let me remind you that she's
also a Marval de Beaufort.

515
01:08:03,306 --> 01:08:08,451
Father Jean-Marie is listening
to his sister attentively.

516
01:08:08,452 --> 01:08:11,246
And he's leaving the central stage.

517
01:08:15,316 --> 01:08:19,603
No matter which religion or political
conviction we have...

518
01:08:19,604 --> 01:08:22,421
...we cannot but admire the courage
of this priest who's going down...

519
01:08:22,422 --> 01:08:24,237
...to save a soul.

520
01:08:24,238 --> 01:08:26,403
That's the only reason why
he's going down.

521
01:08:26,404 --> 01:08:29,204
This is a fantastic example.

522
01:08:30,307 --> 01:08:34,755
Isn't this the way martyrs
sacrifice themselves?

523
01:08:59,645 --> 01:09:02,061
Why don't you use the swing...

524
01:09:02,062 --> 01:09:03,874
...to get the others up?

525
01:09:03,876 --> 01:09:06,478
Because the swing cannot get close
enough to the car.

526
01:09:06,479 --> 01:09:08,875
The smallest pressure on the trunk...

527
01:09:08,876 --> 01:09:10,234
...will make it snap.

528
01:09:10,235 --> 01:09:13,338
With a crane, you can get to them.

529
01:09:13,339 --> 01:09:16,260
The weight should go
straight onto the car.

530
01:09:16,261 --> 01:09:19,293
Straight, yes.
-They all have to go at the same time.

531
01:09:19,294 --> 01:09:22,068
So they can't go one by one?

532
01:09:22,069 --> 01:09:26,972
No, if you pull one up,
the car would come up.

533
01:09:26,973 --> 01:09:31,142
The tree would snap and you'd
get a huge roller coaster.

534
01:09:35,931 --> 01:09:38,162
Alright, father.

535
01:10:40,227 --> 01:10:44,386
Forgive me, father.
I know you have a pure soul, my son.

536
01:10:44,387 --> 01:10:46,885
I don't.
-Yes, you do.

537
01:10:46,886 --> 01:10:51,082
I was always faithful to my wife.
-That's important to the Lord.

538
01:10:51,083 --> 01:10:54,462
I absolve you.

539
01:10:54,463 --> 01:10:59,764
But I haven't finished.
-Excuse me. I'm going back up.

540
01:11:05,217 --> 01:11:09,738
Don't you have an electric hoist?
-Yes, but it's broken.

541
01:11:13,477 --> 01:11:17,218
He'd rather send others to heaven
than himself.

542
01:11:19,435 --> 01:11:23,531
Anyway, your wife's no longer worried.

543
01:11:23,532 --> 01:11:28,337
Young lady, I hope your husband
is as religious as my wife.

544
01:11:28,501 --> 01:11:32,283
My husband. He's religious alright...

545
01:11:32,284 --> 01:11:35,241
...but in a rather bloody way.

546
01:12:59,509 --> 01:13:04,570
The father seems to think God works
in a mysterious way.

547
01:13:04,650 --> 01:13:09,097
Dear viewers, the reality
of father Jean-Marie...

548
01:13:09,098 --> 01:13:13,085
...who experiences
the beauty of his task...

549
01:13:13,086 --> 01:13:18,355
...invites us to think about the
mystery of life, about love...

550
01:13:18,356 --> 01:13:24,138
...money and the end of our lives.

551
01:13:25,415 --> 01:13:29,667
Ah, the special rope
arrived from Grenoble.

552
01:13:29,668 --> 01:13:32,202
Preparations are ongoing.

553
01:13:32,203 --> 01:13:35,146
Everybody's helping as best they can.

554
01:13:35,147 --> 01:13:40,172
There's an atmosphere of
feverish excitement and caution.

555
01:13:40,732 --> 01:13:42,852
We're all ready.

556
01:13:43,753 --> 01:13:46,017
Well, almost all.

557
01:13:56,453 --> 01:13:58,363
On this highway...

558
01:13:58,364 --> 01:14:02,590
...more than 3000 people died
in 10 years.

559
01:14:02,591 --> 01:14:06,774
One Roubier more or less.

560
01:14:06,775 --> 01:14:10,398
Gentlemen, do not insist.
I gave my word to Henri Roubier.

561
01:14:11,007 --> 01:14:15,716
I do not negotiate with others
while he's still alive.

562
01:14:15,717 --> 01:14:19,637
What if something tragic happens?

563
01:14:20,149 --> 01:14:24,827
We'll discuss that when it happens.

564
01:14:52,046 --> 01:14:55,388
It's just a big advertisement.

565
01:14:55,389 --> 01:14:58,813
A famous person like Roubier
does this for an advertisement?

566
01:14:58,814 --> 01:15:02,357
Some people don't know when to stop.

567
01:15:08,298 --> 01:15:10,717
This isn't candid camera, is it?

568
01:15:10,718 --> 01:15:14,067
But I recognise you,
Mr Jacques Gellogra.

569
01:15:15,484 --> 01:15:19,430
The people in the car seem to have
resigned themselves to their fate.

570
01:15:20,341 --> 01:15:23,940
It takes courage to stay so calm.

571
01:15:26,699 --> 01:15:28,644
Will you vote for him?

572
01:15:28,645 --> 01:15:32,122
If he survives and decides
to run, definitely.

573
01:15:44,408 --> 01:15:47,029
You've seen the car by now.
You can't look any longer.

574
01:15:47,030 --> 01:15:48,637
What if it falls?

575
01:15:48,638 --> 01:15:54,562
This is the most dangerous part
of the rescue operation.

576
01:15:55,378 --> 01:15:58,299
Instead of getting them up,
rescue workers will...

577
01:15:58,300 --> 01:16:00,884
...let them descend towards sea level.

578
01:16:00,885 --> 01:16:06,061
Where divers will be ready to help
in case of any danger.

579
01:16:06,843 --> 01:16:11,955
You will witness the rescue
operation as if you were here.

580
01:16:16,660 --> 01:16:19,875
Hello, can you hear me?

581
01:16:19,876 --> 01:16:23,127
Tie yourselves together.

582
01:16:47,555 --> 01:16:52,946
The main mountaineer will go down
to direct the rescue operation.

583
01:16:53,099 --> 01:16:57,731
He'll hand you a double rope
that will lead you towards the ocean.

584
01:16:58,156 --> 01:17:02,483
Using a double rope in
the classic manner.

585
01:17:03,404 --> 01:17:07,488
Who can still maintain that mountain
climbing is a useless sport?

586
01:17:08,741 --> 01:17:13,686
We've almost reached the moment
when they'll be rescued. The climax.

587
01:17:14,910 --> 01:17:19,941
We'll get back a man strengthened
by today's ordeal.

588
01:17:19,942 --> 01:17:24,075
And if Henri Roubier will decide about the
fate of the country tomorrow...

589
01:17:24,076 --> 01:17:28,995
...at least he'll know that big people
need little people.

590
01:17:30,005 --> 01:17:34,107
He fell down.
Now there are four people in the car.

591
01:17:34,108 --> 01:17:38,340
The tree. The tree might break.
This is terrible.

592
01:17:38,341 --> 01:17:41,059
I can't watch.

593
01:17:44,326 --> 01:17:47,738
Do you remember the police man?
If somebody gets out...

594
01:17:47,739 --> 01:17:52,253
...it'll come up. The lethal roller
coaster. It's terrible.

595
01:17:52,254 --> 01:17:54,949
I can't watch anymore.

596
01:17:54,950 --> 01:17:59,144
So now we have four people in a car.
On top of a tree.

597
01:18:09,142 --> 01:18:10,579
What happened?

598
01:18:10,580 --> 01:18:15,030
It must have been the rope
from Grenoble.

599
01:18:15,031 --> 01:18:17,374
It snapped.
-Into the camera, please.

600
01:18:17,375 --> 01:18:20,300
It must have been rolled up wrong.

601
01:18:20,634 --> 01:18:22,801
Listen.

602
01:18:25,251 --> 01:18:30,582
A helicopter. We'll be rescued.
Our last chance. Our only hope.

603
01:18:33,501 --> 01:18:39,404
One gust of wind and the helicopter
will crush against the rocks.

604
01:18:39,658 --> 01:18:42,494
But let's not get ahead of ourselves.

605
01:18:42,495 --> 01:18:46,985
The helicopter flies like a huge...

606
01:18:46,986 --> 01:18:50,525
...eagle to its nest.

607
01:19:11,421 --> 01:19:16,778
The device that grabs the car has
arrived at the dangerous location.

608
01:19:17,255 --> 01:19:21,163
Dear viewers, we need a miracle.

609
01:19:22,465 --> 01:19:29,076
Yes. No. They can't have lasted
this long and fall to their deaths now?

610
01:19:29,869 --> 01:19:35,468
They must be rescued. I feel... I know
they'll be rescued. I just know it.

611
01:19:49,212 --> 01:19:52,650
The device that grabs the car
is no longer in position.

612
01:19:52,651 --> 01:19:56,458
Two people are hanging above the abyss.

613
01:19:56,459 --> 01:20:00,887
And they're turning
around and around.

614
01:20:01,269 --> 01:20:04,773
A dizzying merry-go-round.

615
01:20:04,774 --> 01:20:08,803
Oh, they're back. It worked.
Thank God.

616
01:20:08,804 --> 01:20:13,497
They're back in the car.
They've been saved.

617
01:20:41,748 --> 01:20:45,706
My heart. This is costing me
years of my life.

618
01:20:46,492 --> 01:20:50,507
Just in time. They're
attaching the cables.

619
01:21:15,347 --> 01:21:19,534
There's a fire. Fire, fire.
The fire brigade.

620
01:21:19,535 --> 01:21:23,142
Fire.
-Attach the last cable.

621
01:21:25,481 --> 01:21:30,920
It can't be true. Such bad luck. Fire.
Gendarme, call the fire brigade.

622
01:21:36,836 --> 01:21:40,270
All resources are being used.
It's great.

623
01:21:40,271 --> 01:21:45,355
The firemen connect the hoses
and assume their positions.

624
01:21:45,956 --> 01:21:51,062
The tree would have been on fire if the
fire brigade hadn't been on the alert.

625
01:22:02,905 --> 01:22:07,939
This family, dignified in their grief...

626
01:22:07,941 --> 01:22:11,945
...deserves to be called 'great'.

627
01:22:17,065 --> 01:22:19,733
They've been saved.

628
01:22:19,734 --> 01:22:23,099
The tree gave in, but their
nerves didn't.

629
01:22:23,100 --> 01:22:27,706
There they are. Saved from
hell, from the abyss.

630
01:22:43,782 --> 01:22:46,915
The rescue operation ends like a
Tale of a Thousand and One Nights.

631
01:22:46,916 --> 01:22:50,694
The flying car. Aladdin's car.

632
01:22:56,867 --> 01:23:03,619
The helicopter flies a victory round.
Yes, it is a real victory round.

633
01:23:03,620 --> 01:23:06,868
They get a big applause.

634
01:23:25,917 --> 01:23:32,054
But what's happening?
