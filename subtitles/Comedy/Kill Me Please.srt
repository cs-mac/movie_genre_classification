1
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,900
Oh, Mr. Demanet, come in,

2
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,100
have a seat

3
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:39,600
Well.

4
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm looking for an ashtray,
but there isn't one. Patience.

5
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,600
How are you?

6
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,900
Do you like your room?

7
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:56,200
- Satisfied with accommodations?
- Yes

8
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,400
Well...

9
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,200
Did you read it?

10
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,600
Yes, I saw your history.

11
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,700
And,

12
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,100
Your cancer is terminal

13
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,000
The tumour has spread.

14
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:26,000
How are you feeling?

15
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:29,100
I am not suffering.

16
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,600
In any case,
I try not to suffer.

17
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,600
When did you have
your last chemo?

18
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,400
I don't know and I don't care.

19
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,400
What can you do?

20
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,000
Well, we'll talk about it,

21
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,400
Let's see which protocol we chose.

22
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,000
The reason I wanted to talk about is,

23
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,800
that I saw...

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
that everything seemed OK in your last X-ray film.

25
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,600
You want my x-rays?

26
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:05,700
You don't need to go to the hospital to read an X-ray...

27
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,700
You read the newspapers in the hospital
and x-rays...

28
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,000
No, no...

29
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,700
It was just...

30
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,700
By the way, I greatly admire your work...

31
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,700
I came...

32
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,800
Here...

33
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:26,500
I just want to know how excatly it will happen.

34
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,000
it is important for us

35
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,800
since it is an encounter with death.

36
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,100
Allow me?

37
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,700
Mr. Demanet,

38
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,900
my clinic assists

39
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,200
patients to end their life.

40
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,000
It is physician assisted suicide,

41
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,400
but we try to prevent

42
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,000
this act, if possible.

43
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,100
We both know

44
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,300
why we are here.

45
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,600
I can stay with you as long as necessary

46
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:27,700
because you decide
whether it happens or not...

47
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,200
In short...

48
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,400
Come back and see me when you are ready.

49
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
- Have a cigarette?
- No, I don't smoke.

50
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,700
Thank you.

51
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,400
(Knock on the Door)
Come in.

52
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,900
You can put this on the bed?

53
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,700
Muriel...

54
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,800
Can I ask you a favor?

55
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,800
Can you mail these for me?

56
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:30,200
And...this is to thank you for
what you are doing for me.

57
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,600
So you have made your decision?

58
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,900
(DEMANET) No...

59
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:43,000
Please don't cry.

60
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:48,000
- I am sorry. - Don't cry,
Or I'll have to make you laugh.

61
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,300
And this is not why I am here. Right?

62
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,300
You don't want me
to make you laugh!

63
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,900
(Knock on the door)
Yes?

64
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,000
Hello.

65
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,500
I am ready.

66
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:24,700
I am sorry, but it is not possible.

67
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,100
What is not possible?

68
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:32,000
I just spoke to your primary doctor;
you are in perfect health,

69
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:35,200
You don't have a tumour,
you lied to us.

70
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,200
Under these circumstances,

71
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,000
I am afraid, I
can't assist you.

72
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,100
You just don't have the balls to...

73
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,100
to do it because I am famous. Right?

74
00:06:56,200 --> 00:07:00,200
I had worked in psychiatry for twenty years,
I know that chronically depressed

75
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,000
can convince themselves that
their illness is irreversible..

76
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:08,200
In a few months, with your resources, you can
easily rediscover the taste of life.

77
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,100
- What?
- Talk to your girlfriend...

78
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:13,100
She left me.

79
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:16,900
Well, your ex-girlfriend,
your future girlfriend...

80
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,900
- Your friends...
- Bla, bla, bla.

81
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,300
Get someone who doesn't talk much

82
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,600
and is a good listener.

83
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:29,300
Rent a boat
and take a trip around the world.

84
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,700
Bla, bla, bla.

85
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:45,100
You know what Rabelais
said in his Farewell letter?

86
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:49,400
"Turn down the Curtain,
the Farce is Over."

87
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,200
Then I...

88
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:56,500
I'll drop the curtain with
or without the audience, the boat and
everything else.

89
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,400
The curtain falls.

90
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,600
(KRUGER)
We don't do Shakespeare here.

91
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,600
I am not doing Shakespeare,
This is Molière,

92
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,900
the Farce is Over!

93
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:10,600
Thank you, Mr. Kruger!

94
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,500
Mr. Demanet,
if you want to talk, we are available.

95
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:18,500
The bloody farce is over.

96
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:21,000
The curtain falls!

97
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:25,700
- Mr. Demanet...
- Silence!

98
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:31,200
Please, get out of there.

99
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,500
Mr. Demanet!

100
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,500
(Water is running)

101
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,800
Mr. Demanet!

102
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,900
Mr. Demanet!

103
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:45,600
- Open the door.
- Mr. Demanet!

104
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,900
- Mr. Demanet!
- Get out of there!

105
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,700
Mr. Demanet, please open!

106
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,800
- Call Steve now!
- Steve!

107
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,100
Mr. Demanet!

108
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,400
Mr. Demanet...

109
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,300
Mr. Demanet!

110
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:17,400
Steve, tourniquet now!

111
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,900
Breathe, damn it!

112
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,400
Quiet,

113
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,700
Breathe!

114
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,700
Come on! Good.

115
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:38,400
You are...

116
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,500
alive!

117
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,200
< You are all aware of the drama

118
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,500
that took place today in our clinic

119
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,900
I take advantage of this meeting

120
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:58,800
To tell you that this kind of risk
is part of our work here

121
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,700
I am not saying it is normal

122
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,100
that people cut their veins in
my institute.

123
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:07,900
My clinic was designed specifically

124
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:11,800
to prevent the kind of barbaric act that happened
today in our toilet.

125
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:17,600
I thank you for your courage,
your humanity, and professionalism..

126
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,000
Muriel, if an event like this

127
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
should happen again,

128
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,600
keep a cool head.

129
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,100
I want to say to all of you:

130
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:32,900
do not make friends with our
patients.

131
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,500
Compassion? Yes,

132
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,400
Friendship? No.

133
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,500
< Hi,

134
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,900
< My name is Virgile.

135
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,000
< I've learned about you on the Internet,

136
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,600
< On some forum
about suicide

137
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,900
< ... your name and your clinic

138
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,800

139
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,300
< I am interested...
I wanted to die since I was little,

140
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:13,400
< I made the first attempt
at the age of seven.

141
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,900
< I threw myself out of the window

142
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:23,600
< but I forgot to open it.

143
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:29,100
< I remember vividly
how I did it,

144
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:31,600
< It was one Sunday morning.

145
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,000
< I thought about it for several days,
I calculated...

146
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:40,200
< that at the age of 7, I would remain a child for
at least 10 more years...

147
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,400
< And I just hated
being a child.

148
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,100
< My suicide attempt at the age of 7,

149
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:50,300
< was the youngest attempted suicide
in France.

150
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:54,000
(Begins to stutter)
< Then I became an adult.

151
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,400
< Being an adult was even worse than being a child.

152
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,500
< I can't,

153
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:07,500
< I just know I can't
do it alone,

154
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:10,100
< Can't do it alone.

155
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:12,700
< I tried, but I can't.

156
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:16,300
< I need your help.

157
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:26,700
- Thank you.
- (Nurse) Follow me.

158
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,600
The bathroom is here. There are DVDs,
and this is the remote control.

159
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:47,000
If you need anything, just call.
The doctor will see you soon.

(American Accent) < Your office... I need
to present

162

< I didn't know there was a clinic
like this,

163

a clinic...

164
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,800
(Knock on the Door)
Come in.

165
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Hi, Virgile.

166
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,800
- Had a good trip?
- No, not at all.

167
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:29,900
I told you I was away.

168
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,300
- Is your moral good?
- Not exactly.

169
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:42,500
Well... Are you ready to leave?
(Knock on the door)

170
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,800
Doctor, Mr. Nora is waiting.

171
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:57,600
I will return in the afternoon.

172
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:01,200
- Is everything alright?
- Yes.

173
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:15,300
(Knock on the door)
Yes?

174
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:18,300
- Hello.
- Doctor.

175
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:24,100
- How are you today?
- Today is the big day.

176
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,500
The farewell day.

177
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,700
And you won't be asking me anymore
How I am doing.

178
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,400
- The time is up.
- The time is up.

179
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,400
Are you sure you have made the right choice?

180
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,700
This is the only solution,
the only thing that remains to be done,

181
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:43,400
This is what I want,
I must do it. I am not interested
in anything else.

182
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,300
- I just want to know how it will happen?
- Very good.

183
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:49,300
I asked for Champagne!

184
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,500
- Not yet.
- Steve...

185
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,700
I expect 2 things from you.

186
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:59,100
First, I want you to explain the procedure;

187
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:03,200
How long will it be
from the moment I put

188
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:08,100
the poison to my lips
until I fall asleep.

189
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:11,400
The second thing...
is more important that the first...

190
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,500
- the student...
- Your last wish, your ultimate desire. - Yes.

191
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,700
- Should I introduce her to you?
- Thank you.

192
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,700
Sofia.

193
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:25,500
- Hi.
- Hi, Sofia.

194
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,100
Like her?

195
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:30,400
I should ask you.

196
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,900
- Yes, the best.
- Me too.

197
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:37,300
- Excellent, thank you.
- Sofia, you can start to prepare.

198
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,500
Mr. Nora, I want you to hear me well.

199
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:55,300
You will have a glass of water with the dose
of sodium pentobarbital.

200
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
You can change your mind and refuse
to drink it. It is very important.

201
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:05,800
Even if you have the slightest doubt,
take all the time you need.

202
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,800
We are here for you.

203
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,000
But if you drink a single sip,

204
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,500
it will be impossible to turn back.

205
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,800
After that, you will have
no more than

206
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,300
three minutes.

207
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:42,200
It is rare that we must face situations where
things could be so irreversible.

208
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,900
- You think so?
- Yes.

209
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,700
I know this quite well.

210
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:52,200
- Let's do the champagne. Shall we?
- YeS. - Steve?

211
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,900
Champagne. Absolutely.

212
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,500
- Please.
- I am ready.

213
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,700
All aboard! Welcome on board.

214
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:03,400
Thank you.

215
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,500
- Mr. Nora. Have a good trip.
- Thank you.

216
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:11,000
- We are leaving.
- (NORA) Thank you.

217
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:17,200
- Salute.
- For you, Sofia. - For you.

218
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:21,800
- The taste alone. - Sofie, is this your
real name or for the battle only?

219
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,400
- A bit of indiscretion, eh?
- Not sure if I understand.

220
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,300
You want to know if this is
my real name?

221
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:33,500
- No.
- It is Sofia.

222
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,700
- You don't like it?
- I like it a lot.

223
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:38,600
- I can change it.
- it is just a name.

224
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,700
A name is a lifetime.
What is your name?

225
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,000
- Simon.
- Nice name!

226
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:49,700
- Serves me right.
- Simon, Nora. Sounds good.

227
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,300
Let it go.

228
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:02,600
- Can I remove your glasses?
- Yes.

229
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,400
- How are you feeling?
- Well.

230
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,900
Good bye.

231
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:28,900
Thank you. I'll be waiting at the office.

232
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,800
Steve will take care of you.

233
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,600
I used to be a singer,

234
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,900
dramatic soprano.

235
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:26,800
I have a lung cancer and I
lost my voice.

236
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,100
< I have lost my reason to live...

237
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,700
Accept me in your clinic.

238
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,200
< I am a coward. I don't have the courage
to throw myself under the train.

239
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,900
< I agree,
to give you all my property,

240
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,800
< everything I have,
I beg of you.

241
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
(Knock on the door)
Come in.

242
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,500
- You asked for me?
- Yes.

243
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:57,400
and "the bridge of All Saints."
Don't you have a family to attend?

244
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:01,000
No, but thanks for asking. And you?

245
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,600
Your wife, for example?

246
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:07,600
Just got divorce papers back from the
United States.

247
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:13,500
In the meantime, stop asking question of my
patients. There were complaints.

248
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:16,600
No, the complaints were
against your clinic.

249
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:19,600
- No, against my ex-wife.
- It is just an example.

250
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:22,800
The inheritance. It is so easy to
get rid of things.

251
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,600
If you want to shut us down, tell me immediately.

252
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,600
Don't make me announce it.

253
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:33,600
I ask you to respect
my routine.

254
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:36,600
- Your routine?
- Yes, my routine.

255
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,800
One day, the right to end one's life
will be a constitutional right.

256
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:45,400
That day, we will remember our conversation
and you will understand what we are talking about.

257
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:49,400
In the meantime, you don't have to understand anything,
just forgive.

258
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,900
You are neither the first nor the last.

259
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:56,900
Please,
let me do my work.

260
00:23:57,100 --> 00:24:00,900
- Please respect the suffering.
- I am just doing my work!

261
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:03,700
Next time, I will bring a judge,
And don't tell me to leave.

262
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,900
I talk to whomever I want and about
anything I want.

263
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,700
Good bye.

264
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,300
(Knock on the door)

265
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,800
(Speaking in English)
Revenue.

266
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,100
Come in.

267
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,500
- Come, I think it is OK.
- Good Evening.

268
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:36,200
Come in.

269
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,000
See, you are quick.

270
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,000
Well.

271
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,800
Well, excuse me.

272
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:47,500
- What is your name?
- I am... new?

273
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:52,300
- I am sorry. I am not dressed.
- Don't worry.

274
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,500
I am sure you have seen worse.

275
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:58,700
Thank goodness, it is disappearing.
(Speaking in English)

276
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,900
I don't understand English.

277
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:04,800
- I should go away.
- It is misunderstanding.

278
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,500
- I am inspector Evrard,
of Financial Agency. - One moment!

279
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:12,000
I need to speak!

280
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:16,000
(Speaking in English)

281
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:20,000
Do you speak English?

282
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,500
I am too emotional, okay?

283
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:25,200
I just finished reading a letter...

284
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,500
Damn it!

285
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:31,000
And according to my wife...

286
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:35,300
and it is necessary

287
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:38,400
to give it to Dr. Kruger right away.

288
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,700
- This is misunderstanding.
- Before I change my mind.

289
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:44,600
One moment! If you don't give it to him now,

290
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:49,900
I'll back out and change my mind.

291
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:53,800
Excuse me, I ...

292
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,500
- I am sorry.
- It is OK, but I...

293
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:00,000
No, you must give it to him now,

294
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,600
Otherwise, I will change my mind.

295
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,500
(Speeking in English)

296
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:08,600
- Go or I will change my mind.
- But I am not...

297
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,100
I am sorry

298
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:13,700
I am too emotional!

299
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,100
Mr. Plouvier, come,

300
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:49,800
it is snowing, you can't stay here.

301
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,800
Come with me.

302
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:59,000
(Knock on the door)
Come in.

303
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,200
Can I speak to you for a moment?

304
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,000
- Sure, sit down.
- No, I'll stand.

305
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,900
And according to my ultimate desire.

306
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:15,600
I often dream that...

307
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:19,600
I am a US Marine
during the war in Vietnam

308
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,800
and I am on patrol in the middle of the jungle.

309
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,800
Suddenly, one of my men
steps on a mine and it explodes.

310
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,800
We stick our nose anywhere
and there is always violence and blood.

311
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,500
Then they start the bombing

312
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:35,700
and all my men fall,
one after another.

313
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:39,300
I am wounded, but continue to run
even when taking the bullets.

314
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:42,700
I hide behind a tree

315
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:46,000
then take cyanide and die,
I thought of ...

316
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,800
I thought of a scene.

317
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:53,100
I carried a paintball.

318
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:56,800
could be done in the woods
with its nurses

319
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:00,200
to play that kind of ...

320
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,800
Virgile, 70% of people who commit suicide
choose a violent death.

321
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:09,200
Our clinic was created

322
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,900
to give dignity to suicide.

323
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,800
In short, a kind of dignity.

324
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,700
Yes, dignity.

325
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,400
Come in.

326
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,800
I leave the tray here.

327
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,700
Want a dedication?

328
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,300
Yes.

329
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,000
Come closer.

330
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:58,600
- And you?
- Yes, have a pen?

331
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,300
Thank you.

332
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:09,600
- What is your name?
- Luc.

333
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,400
For Luc,

334
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:15,400
My last

335
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:18,400
ray of sunshine...

336
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:23,200
before death.

337
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,600
Thank you.

338
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,000
No...

339
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,600
I can't.

340
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,100
Want my jewelery?

341
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,000
No, I can't.

342
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:52,900
I can't...

343
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:54,700
No!

344
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,300
(LUC E RACHELANSIMANO)

345
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:16,000
My story is complicated.

346
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,600
My father died two years ago,
after three marriages,

347
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,700
I am the first child.

348
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,700
Then he married

349
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:25,100
the second time a few years ago

350
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:28,400
and then the third time
Marie-Pierre,

351
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,500
with whom he had two children.

352
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:34,200
when he died, he left everything
to them.

353
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,300
It is not right,

354
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:41,800
we came first and
he left nothing for us,

355
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:44,200
neither for me nor for my mother!

356
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,100
This is not normal. Nor is it legal

357
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:52,700
So, we hired a lawyer, because they were
so horrible to

358
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:55,100
my mother. Marie-Pierre,

359
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:59,400
things had never gone well,
she just wanted the money from my father,

360
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:02,100
It was clear from the very beginning.

361
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,000
There was a procedural error,
everything has been paid on my behalf,

362
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,800
I will try to recover the money,

363
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,900
I am so exhausted.

364
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:15,700
Since I lost my mother,
six months ago,

365
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:19,600
I don't want to face these problems anymore,
I just want to end it.

366
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,900
Since the money is in my account,

367
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,900
I could leave...

368
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:30,100
I wrote her a letter, in which I leave
her everything.

369
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:34,200
- 12,758,420 euro.
- She has no children?

370
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,700
No, I wasn't interested,

371
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:38,800
I don't care.

372
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,100
I will give you a check,

373
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:48,400
It is for you, because I think
you help people.

374
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,300
Jean-Marc,

375
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:52,000
Listen...

376
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:58,700
All that my father had
will never go to these people,

377
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:01,700
because they are worst of the worst.

378
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:04,100
They made us suffer so much,

379
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:06,600
so, for me, it is fair.

380
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,700
Jean-Marc,

381
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:10,900
There are other places,

382
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:15,100
other entities
he gave his money to.

383
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:17,600
Yes, but it is complicated.

384
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:20,500
I want you...

385
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,900
(Knock on the door)

386
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:33,400
Yes?

387
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:40,700
Good Evening,

388
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:44,500
I am Juliette Evrard
of the Tax Agency, would like...

389
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:48,900
I have already told your colleagues that
I don't have any money to pay my debts

390
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:53,600
And considering the fact that I might die in three
days, I would like to avoid this subject.

391
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,600
I am here to ask questions about the
clinic and Dr. Kruger.

392
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,200
Who are you?

393
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:06,700
As I said, I am Juliette Evrard
of the Tax Agency.

394
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,800
I would like to know

395
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,500
how you came in touch
with Dr. Kruger.

396
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,100
Mr. Vidal?

397
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,000
Yes.

398
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:25,500
How did you come in contact
with Dr. Kruger?

399
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:28,100
Through the Internet.

400
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,800
OK.

401
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:36,900
Have you made donations to him
or the clinic?

402
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:40,100
I have no more money,
I can't make donations.

403
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:43,400
Don't you have a personal fortune?

404
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:47,000
I did, but not anymore.

405
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:52,400
And how did you pay for

406
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,600
services of the clinic?

407
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:59,700
I have credit.

408
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,800
- Credit.
- Nothing else.

409
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,500
Nothing else.

410
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:11,700
OK.

411
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,100
Thank you.

412
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,600
As my last wish, I would like to

413
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:42,100
sing the Marsigliese,
I have never performed it officially.

414
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:43,900
Oh, yeh?

415
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:47,500
But I don't want to sing just for myself,

416
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,800
I would like

417
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:56,200
to dedicate that to all
patients who are suffering like me,

418
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:59,600
and give them this Marsigliese,

419
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:02,400
that will unite all of us who suffer.

420
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,800
Very willingly,

421
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:09,100
but I have to ask

422
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:11,500
individual patients.

423
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:16,600
It will have more force to it if I do,
understand?

424
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,400
Yes, but maybe you could also invite

425
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:22,200
the people in the village,

426
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,100
simple people,

427
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:27,900
who could perhaps
spend an evening at the clinic.

428
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:30,100
Yes...

429
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,200
Of course.

430
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:35,000
But We don't have many contacts

431
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,500
with the villagers,

432
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:41,000
I am not sure it is
a good idea.

433
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,800
- Oh yeah?
- You see...

434
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:47,500
Rachel, there are tensions between us

435
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,100
and the villagers,

436
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:55,100
so, it would be very difficult
to do what you ask.

437
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,900
But we could at least
invite the fire brigade,

438
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,200
They are nice to everyone,

439
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,600
They are young and beautiful.

440
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:09,000
As long as you don't stretch
your voice.

441
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,800
They may cause misunderstanding.

442
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,000
(Noise)

443
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,200
(Alarm)

444
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:26,200
Fire!

445
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:30,800
Is anybody there?

446
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,500
- What happened?
- Get out, quick.

447
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:36,700
(Cough)

448
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:42,600
Hey!

449
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,500
Is anybody there?

450
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,400
Hey!

451
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:52,900
(LUC) Go down,

452
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,000
Calmly.

453
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,600
(Man) Shit!

454
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:00,800
(SYLVIE) Go downstairs.

455
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,900
But it is cold here,

456
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:05,300
Can I bring blankets?

457
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,300
What a lousy organization!

458
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:16,300
- Mr. Antoine, Come,
There is a fire - What is going on?

459
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:20,500
- Come, there is a fire!
- I would like to stay here, I want to sleep...

460
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:23,000
- There is no time.
- Leave me!

461
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:27,300
The roof is on fire!

462
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:32,300
Take the fire extinguishers!
Beware of gas!

463
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:36,000
- Can I have a hot drink?
- The kitchen is ruined.

464
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:39,000
Don't you have a thermos?

465
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,400
The kitchen is on fire!

466
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:15,500
(Cries)

467
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,700
- (KRUGER) Turn it off!
- Shit.

468
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,700
(JEAN-MARC) At least he is not cold.

469
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:25,700
(KRUGER) Hurry!

470
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,800
and dead.

471
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,000
Who was he?

472
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,300
- Whose boots are these?
- I don't know.

473
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,800
(Cough)

474
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:15,900
Steve counted them. All of them.

475
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:19,200
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

476
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:23,900
- What are the damages?
- We lost the kitchen and the pantry.

477
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:27,300
There is nothing to eat.

478
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:32,200
- Is he dead?
- Yes.

479
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:36,400
We have to call the police?

480
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:39,500
- Did you call?
- No, I won't.

481
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:41,400
Why?

482
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:44,900
Mind your own business
and let me do mine.

483
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:48,300
- I am calling my superiors.
- Fine, call them!

484
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:51,200
Perhaps the Tax Agency could give us a hand.

485
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:03,400
(Champ)

486
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:23,900
It is not possible.

487
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:41,800
(Crying Woman)

488
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:46,000
Quiet...

489
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,600
- What did you?
- Stay away.

490
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:59,200
- It is contagious?
- Virgile, please.

491
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,600
It is a question, isn't it?

492
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:08,100
If you don't bite, me, I will suffocate.

493
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:12,100
- Suffocate?
- It is better now.

494
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:14,100
I only watch!

495
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,400
I have to go.

496
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:35,200
Now?

497
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,900
Doctor,

498
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:03,500
One moment.

499
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:06,000
As my last wish...

500
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:09,500
I did the honeymoon
in Paris,

501
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:11,600
in 1975,

502
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:14,300
This is the menu of the food...

503
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:19,900
we ate
the first night.

504
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:22,300
What restaurant was it?

505
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:25,700
It was at the Eiffel Tower,
nothing extraordinary, just okay.

506
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:29,200
Have a Chateau Latour
or a Pessac Lenoir?

507
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:32,500
An old red wine would be fine,

508
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:35,100
but you must have...

509
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:40,100
It was a leg of lamb,
braised mushrooms.

510
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:44,000
I would like to eat this dish,
before I die.

511
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:47,200
There was also a wonderful dessert!

512
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:52,000
Something with orange,
but I forgot the name.

513
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:55,500
- Savoy Tart with orange.
- No, Savoayrd.

514
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:58,600
- It was a sav...
- Savarin! - Yes!

515
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:00,800
Thank you!

516
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:03,100
All right.

517
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:07,000
Mr. Breiman, I am very sorry,

518
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:10,900
but it is all burned,
we had a fire,

519
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:13,100
we have lost everything.

520
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:16,400
You say it is impossible,
like everything else here.

521
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:18,200
Impossible?

522
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,500
Yes, I am so sorry.

523
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:23,900
No, I phoned,
a promise is a promise.

524
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:27,800
And everything was destroyed!
I am sorry, please believe me.

525
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,000
You are sorry?
Why don't you go and take a bath in shit!

526
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:34,100
I am so sorry to be sorry!

527
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:36,800
(Speaking in English)

528
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:49,300
Please bring all the patients
to the great hall.

529
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:52,400
Yes, patients and personnel.

530
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:08,500
On behalf of the clinic

531
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:10,900
and my entire team,

532
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:15,100
I applogise
for the events of last night.

533
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:19,200
I know it is difficult
for each of you,

534
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:22,900
but everything will return to
normal soon. Questions?

535
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:24,400
Yes.

536
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:28,700
There is one thing...

537
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:31,600
I didn't realize
one could die in fire.

538
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:34,400
Is it possible?

539
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,700
This wasn't done on purpose,

540
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:40,000
It was an accident.

541
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:44,200
- I would like to die in
an accident. - The answer is no.

542
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:48,700
You can express personal preferences
in the private therapy.

543
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:50,900
Our treatment is interrupted?

544
00:45:51,100 --> 00:45:54,900
The protocols and therapies are
temporarily suspended. There are more
urgent things,

545
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:57,700
But everything will be resolved quickly.

546
00:45:58,200 --> 00:45:59,900
Quickly?

547
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:03,300
He had promised
that the day I arrive,

548
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:05,400
I'd be dead.

549
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:09,500
Things have happened,
The fire and I don't know what else,

550
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:12,200
and I am alive.

551
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:15,800
The only thing I want

552
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:19,600
is to be the first to die today.

553
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:23,200
No, I was here before,

554
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:25,800
and I want to die before her.

555
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:30,100
- The lady is first.
- When will the breakfast be ready?

556
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:33,700
All organizational problems
will be resolved soon

557
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:36,000
thanks to our team:

558
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:39,100
Muriel, Sylvie, Bob e Luc
we are here at your service.

559
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:41,600
I want to go to a different place.

560
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:44,000
- Different place?
- To another clinic.

561
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:47,000
You can't continue like this:

562
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:50,500
with fire,
people who are in crisis and have claims.

563
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:54,600
I have heard about a clinic
near Geneva. I will try there.

564
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:59,400
- Let me have your auto.
- Mr. Johnson...

565
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:03,000
Sure.

566
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:08,800
(SYLVIE) Tea, Coffeè?

567
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:18,500
And my place.

568
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:26,900
- And for you.
- Thank you.

569
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:31,500
- Tea, Coffee?
- A glass of water.

570
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:39,200
Here.

571
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:44,200
- Don't you have continental breakfast?
- Everything was burned.

572
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:48,600
- But the program includes Continental
Breakfast. - Tèa, Coffeè?

573
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:52,000
- No, I would like a croissant.
- There are none.

574
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:55,500
Then I am going into my room.

575
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:05,100
See you later.

576
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:09,400
I will be there.

577
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:14,400
See you later.

578
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,600
< Excuse me,

579
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:22,400
< try the clinic of Doctor Kruger.

580
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:24,500
< Never heard of it.

581
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,900
< - I have been told
that there is a clinic. - Never heard of it!

582
00:48:29,100 --> 00:48:32,800
< - Check the clinic
of Doctor Kruger. - Don't know any.

583
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,800
< It is a shame.

584
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
< Clinic of Doctor Kruger

585
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:38,800
< Is it here?

586
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,100
< Far away, but it is better this way.

587
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:43,100
< Why do you want to leave?

588
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:46,000
< I have my own reasons.

589
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:49,300
< We will stay, but it will not last.

590
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:51,800
< Really? Why?

591
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,800
< We'll see who is going to survive.

592
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,500
Take provision for three days
and bring the police.

593
00:48:57,700 --> 00:49:00,600
- I thought they wouldn't come.
- Tell them we have a dead man.

594
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:03,900
- Tell them?
- Yes, that this is not ours.

595
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:08,500
Here goes the American
to the 9:20 train. Here is 2,000 euro.

596
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:27,100
(Sings)

597
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:39,800
(Horn)

598
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:43,700
(Crowd) - Hey!
- Were are you going?

599
00:49:43,900 --> 00:49:45,700
Enough!

600
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:48,900
Assassins!

601
00:49:50,300 --> 00:49:52,000
Street justice!

602
00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:59,200
(VIDAL) I am thinking,
I feel rushed.

603
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:02,500
- (KRUGER) Next Monday. Good?
- What time?

604
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:04,700
- At the same time, 9:30.
- Good.

605
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:06,700
May I, Doctor?

606
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,100
Excuse me. What is it?

607
00:50:10,700 --> 00:50:12,800
Can I leave?

608
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,100
I would like to go home.

609
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:17,300
To go home?

610
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:21,800
What a good news.
What made you change your mind?

611
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:26,100
The man who died in flames.

612
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:28,500
The man in flames? Interesting.

613
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:31,900
And why?

614
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:35,300
I understand
I was lucky to survive.

615
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:40,400
Ms. Davidson,

616
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:42,900
What a good news!

617
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:48,300
I waited for 10 years
The sentence has been served!

618
00:50:51,100 --> 00:50:53,300
Can I hug you?

619
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:55,200
Yes.

620
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:11,300
You can.

621
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:18,000
Another hold up, just wait.

622
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:28,200
However, you have a beautiful body.

623
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:31,900
When I saw you, I said

624
00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:34,400
what a beautiful body.

625
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,800
There we go.

626
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:11,000
(UOMO) Hey,

627
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:13,600
Driver!

628
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,500
Hurry up.

629
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:22,400
Do you know who is in that coffin?

630
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:24,100
On your knees.

631
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:29,500
Don't you respect the dead.

632
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:33,300
Is that your suicide client?.

633
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:40,400
(Shot)

634
00:52:43,900 --> 00:52:45,900
(SCIA CQUONE)

635
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:53,000
Excuse me,

636
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:55,700
I am sorry.

637
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:08,000
- Sir?
- Thank you.

638
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:12,200
Dear.

639
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:14,700
Does this happen often?

640
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:19,000
Also, because
I have a haemorrhage in my head.

641
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:23,500
- Does it hurt?
- No, I don't feel anything.

642
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:28,300
Are you scared?

643
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:29,900
Fear?

644
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:32,900
No, I have no fear,

645
00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:37,300
I crossed the river of fear
when I arrived here.

646
00:53:37,900 --> 00:53:40,200
Like you, eh? Or her.

647
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:41,800
Excuse me,

648
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:44,600
I am sorry.

649
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:47,500
I used to be

650
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:50,100
afraid of...

651
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:52,500
(TELEPHONE)

652
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:22,700
talking with my wife,

653
00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:25,500
like Churchill in Canada.

654

01:09:45,400 --> 01:09:48,300
- Give me the gun.
- Give it to me!

816
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,100
I am a good shooter.

817
01:10:02,700 --> 01:10:03,800
No!

818
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:05,600
But..

819
01:10:13,700 --> 01:10:16,200
Rachel, I'll cover you, go!

820
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:22,800
Come over here. Quick!

821
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:31,900
(SINGHIOZZl)

822
01:10:59,700 --> 01:11:02,100
Come, give your hand.

823
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:06,000
Let's go there.

824
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:09,400
Breathe.

825
01:11:18,700 --> 01:11:21,000
Sylvie, Rachel, take cover.

826
01:11:21,200 --> 01:11:23,200
In my office, quick!

827
01:11:30,500 --> 01:11:33,000
- Go and play your jokes somewhere else!
- Don't you worry about me.

828
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,600
- I worry about everyone!
- What are you doing?

829
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:43,700
Come back!

830
01:11:55,200 --> 01:11:56,700
Come!

831
01:11:57,900 --> 01:11:59,300
Let's go.

832
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:02,400
Shoot me, you, shithead!

833
01:12:04,900 --> 01:12:06,300
Maybe!

834
01:12:06,500 --> 01:12:09,400
I have come to kill you,

835
01:12:10,100 --> 01:12:11,700
Just like that!

836
01:12:12,100 --> 01:12:14,300
Kill me or go fuck yourself.

837
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:17,100
Murderer!

838
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:20,700
Maybe!

839
01:12:22,100 --> 01:12:23,600
But...

840
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:27,900
Come back!

841
01:12:28,100 --> 01:12:29,800
Where are you going?

842
01:12:31,500 --> 01:12:33,300
Coming right here for you!

843
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:37,800
Come!

844
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:40,800
I got one in the head, I think.

845
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:43,900
Stop it. Get the hell out of here!

846
01:12:53,900 --> 01:12:55,600
Help me.

847
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:10,900
Take the bandages and
and the disinfectant.

848
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:13,800
Don't want to treat me?

849
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:17,100
He is a Nazi who croaked.

850
01:13:47,400 --> 01:13:49,600
Bring here Rachel and Vidal.

851
01:14:03,800 --> 01:14:05,900
I'll show you something.

852
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:12,300
< My name is Julia,

853
01:14:13,900 --> 01:14:16,300
< Since I was little, I have been
suffering from a disease

854
01:14:16,500 --> 01:14:19,800
< that prevents oxygen from
attaching to red blood cells.

855
01:14:20,600 --> 01:14:23,600
< They started treatment
when I was 5 years old.

856
01:14:24,200 --> 01:14:27,100
< I have calculated, at that time

857
01:14:27,300 --> 01:14:29,200
< they did about 15,330 punctures.

858
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:31,800
< My whole body
is covered with red spots...

859
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:33,600
Look.

860
01:14:33,800 --> 01:14:36,000
<... I am allergic to metal.

861
01:14:37,800 --> 01:14:40,200
By the age of 40, I have had about...

862
01:14:40,700 --> 01:14:42,800
45,550 punctures.

863
01:14:51,500 --> 01:14:53,600
Can we stop for a moment?

864
01:14:56,400 --> 01:14:58,900
There is a nice view there.
Very romantic.

865
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:02,400
Let's stop here.

866
01:15:04,700 --> 01:15:06,700
It is beautiful here. Isn't it?

867
01:15:08,900 --> 01:15:10,600
Wait.

868
01:15:15,200 --> 01:15:17,500
- Sit down.
- Thank you.

869
01:15:20,300 --> 01:15:21,900
Don't mention it.

870
01:15:24,700 --> 01:15:26,100
How are you?

871
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:29,400
Are you hot?

872
01:15:40,700 --> 01:15:43,000
- What are you going to do?
- I want only...

873
01:15:44,900 --> 01:15:47,200
- Stop!
- Wait two seconds.

874
01:15:48,700 --> 01:15:50,900
- No!
- Just two seconds.

875
01:15:55,900 --> 01:15:57,400
Enough!

876
01:15:57,600 --> 01:16:00,200
I'll just take of the bandage,
If I don't remove it...

877
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:02,400
Wait.

878
01:16:07,200 --> 01:16:09,400
How can I remove this?

879
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:14,900
I can't take it off.

880
01:16:15,800 --> 01:16:18,700
Why do you care?
I'll croak in two days anyway.

881
01:16:19,200 --> 01:16:20,400
But you?

882
01:16:44,100 --> 01:16:45,700
(NOISE)

883
01:17:04,500 --> 01:17:06,300
What are you doing?

884
01:17:10,300 --> 01:17:12,500
Doctor Kruger is around.

885
01:17:13,700 --> 01:17:15,500
We must go now.

886
01:17:16,700 --> 01:17:19,400
I don't want to die. I have a daughter.

887
01:17:20,100 --> 01:17:22,800
I had nothing to do with these suicides,

888
01:17:23,700 --> 01:17:25,300
I don't want to die.

889
01:17:26,500 --> 01:17:30,100
- I have a daughter.
- Calm down.

890
01:17:32,900 --> 01:17:34,400
Silence.

891
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,100
Want to hide?

892
01:17:43,700 --> 01:17:45,200
Here?

893
01:17:48,500 --> 01:17:50,900
- There, quickly.
- There?

894
01:18:18,900 --> 01:18:22,500
- What is your daughter's name?
- Zoè.

895
01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:40,100
I killed them all.

896
01:18:40,900 --> 01:18:42,800
Just like that....

897
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:48,900
Virgile, you killed them all?

898
01:18:51,300 --> 01:18:54,000
Then we can go,
the way is free.

899
01:18:55,700 --> 01:18:58,100
Now, it is just me and you are done.

900
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:03,100
Why would I kill you?
I have priorities.

901
01:19:04,600 --> 01:19:05,900
Virgile,

902
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:10,000
I promise I will
give take care of you.

903
01:19:10,200 --> 01:19:13,400
Give the knife,
I am a doctor!

904
01:19:14,900 --> 01:19:17,200
After I am done with him, it will be your turn.

905
01:19:17,400 --> 01:19:20,400
I promise you,
I will give you a glass of water.

906
01:19:21,200 --> 01:19:22,800
Virgile...

907
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,300
A glass of water. Remember?

908
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:29,200
Remember?

909
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:37,500
(Hunter) Shit!

910
01:19:49,300 --> 01:19:50,700
Virgile...

911
01:19:53,200 --> 01:19:54,600
Virgile,

912
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:56,800
enough with the dead.

913
01:19:58,200 --> 01:20:00,200
Enough with the dead.

914
01:20:55,400 --> 01:20:57,200
I'll be right back.

915
01:21:12,100 --> 01:21:14,800
Mr. Vidal,
there is no need to close this.

916
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:16,400
Shhh.

917
01:21:20,700 --> 01:21:22,600
Mr. Vidal,

918
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:25,000
Don't close it.

919
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:31,200
- What are you doing?
- Silence.

920
01:21:34,600 --> 01:21:36,600
What are you doing?

921
01:21:39,300 --> 01:21:40,700
No!

922
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:44,300
(COUGHl)

923
01:21:44,900 --> 01:21:46,800
Mr. Vidal,

924
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,200
Please don't lock me!

925
01:21:53,100 --> 01:21:55,000
- Shhh.
- Help!

926
01:21:55,800 --> 01:21:57,200
Help!

927
01:22:05,200 --> 01:22:07,100
Doctor Kruger!

928
01:22:14,900 --> 01:22:16,900
Doctor Kruger!

929
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:53,400
Ms. Rachel,

930
01:22:54,600 --> 01:22:56,800
Can I lie down for a little while?

931
01:23:08,500 --> 01:23:10,700
- You are shaking.
- I am cold.

932
01:23:15,700 --> 01:23:19,000
- You will be fine.
- I am afraid, not, my son.

933
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:23,600
(SINGS IN GERMAN)

934
01:24:07,800 --> 01:24:09,600
Everything will be alright.

935
01:24:11,600 --> 01:24:13,500
It is all very well.

936
01:24:16,400 --> 01:24:18,100
It is alright.

937
01:24:19,200 --> 01:24:20,700
Yes...

938
01:24:24,600 --> 01:24:26,800
< I didn't want to kill my father.

939
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,000
< Now that everyone is dead,

940
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:33,500
< I would like to enter your clinic

941
01:24:33,700 --> 01:24:37,000
< and the only motive
for this would be...

942
01:24:53,200 --> 01:24:56,100
in the interest
of saving the costs to society?

943
01:24:57,700 --> 01:25:00,700
Perhaps you don't understand
the term society.

944
01:25:00,900 --> 01:25:03,400
I'll rephrase the question.

945
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:07,200
What is the price of suicide?

946
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:09,500
I don't care.

947
01:25:09,700 --> 01:25:12,600
Canadians had a study about the
cost of suicide to the society.

948
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:15,700
They do produce more and more
interesting studies.

949
01:25:16,200 --> 01:25:19,500
I speak in terms of costs of
declining productivity.

950
01:25:19,800 --> 01:25:21,300
So, what does it cost?

951
01:25:22,500 --> 01:25:25,000
- Give me a number.
- Oh, shut up.

952
01:25:25,200 --> 01:25:28,900
You say: "How even to calculate
the cost of a suicide?"

953
01:25:29,100 --> 01:25:31,100
There are statistics.

954
01:25:33,200 --> 01:25:35,600
The costs are classified
into two groups:

955
01:25:35,800 --> 01:25:38,300
Direct and indirect.

956
01:25:39,300 --> 01:25:40,900
Do you know about YPL?

957
01:25:41,100 --> 01:25:44,000
Years of Potential Losses.

958
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:47,200
One who dies prematurely

959
01:25:48,100 --> 01:25:50,300
produces less than expected

960
01:25:50,500 --> 01:25:53,700
And this loss of productivity
is a cost to the society.

961
01:25:54,400 --> 01:25:56,700
It means less contributions,
less pensions,

962
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,800
and increase in taxes for others,

963
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:01,900
people like us.

964
01:26:03,300 --> 01:26:05,200
Canadians have calculated

965
01:26:05,400 --> 01:26:08,300
the cost of a single suicide at 850,000 dollars.

966
01:26:09,700 --> 01:26:13,500
Do you know how many people commit suicide
every year on Earth?

967
01:26:14,100 --> 01:26:15,900
Give me a number.

968
01:26:17,100 --> 01:26:18,600
Shut up.

969
01:26:19,700 --> 01:26:21,500
A million.

970
01:26:21,700 --> 01:26:25,300
A million of suicides every year
on our planet.

971
01:26:25,500 --> 01:26:27,400
Stunning. Isn't it?

972
01:26:29,500 --> 01:26:31,400
It is the equivalent of...

973
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,100
12000 football stadiums.

974
01:26:35,800 --> 01:26:37,500
Do the multiplication,

975
01:26:37,700 --> 01:26:41,800
850000 dollars multiplied by
a million of suicides? What is it?

976
01:26:44,100 --> 01:26:46,800
850 billion dollars,

977
01:26:47,500 --> 01:26:50,500
lost people
who cannot deal with their problems,

978
01:26:51,700 --> 01:26:54,500
who have difficulties
psychological or financial.

979
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:03,500
After all, this is not what interested me.
I am interested

980
01:27:03,700 --> 01:27:07,600
and this is why my clinic has received
a grant from the government,

981
01:27:07,800 --> 01:27:09,500
