1
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,112
- I'm telling you, Harry.
- I know.

2
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,952
We could've got away with it.

3
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,191
Did I say that before?

4
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:33,750
- Every day for 30 years.
- Oh.

5
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,274
First thing I wanna do
is to walk on grass.

6
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:50,593
Then I'm gonna sit under a tree
and listen to a bird sing.

7
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:55,670
I wanna go through a door
without hearing bells going off.

8
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,070
I wanna eat good food.
Drink fine wine.

9
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,914
By myself,
not with a hundred other guys.

10
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:04,869
I wanna try Chicken McNuggets.

11
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:11,237
Harry, I wanna hold a woman
for about five years.

12
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,914
Great to get back to
the old neighbourhood, eh?

13
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,470
Yeah, because I can't wait
to see the old gang.

14
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,474
- Think they'll recognise us?
- Why not? We ain't changed.

15
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,836
- The best things never do.
- Damn right.

16
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,631
- OK, pal. Let's go.
- What's the rush?

17
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,599
You've got two men
starting their new lives.

18
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,353
So just open the gate.

19
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,915
What for? You're never gonna make it.

20
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,634
You guys are gonna violate
parole in a week.

21
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,233
Correct me if I'm wrong,

22
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:47,199
but don't I detect pessimism
in his voice?

23
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,271
I think he's being downright hostile.

24
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,639
- After you.
- After you.

25
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,480
No, no. Age before beauty.

26
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:59,035
- Pearls before swine.
- Anything you say, Harry,

27
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,033
as long as we get
the hell out of here.

28
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:05,399
See you guys in one week.

29
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,792
I feel reborn, Arch. Like a new man.

30
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:20,632
Smell that air? That air is free.

31
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,996
So is this paper.

32
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,760
I wanted to see
if I still had the touch.

33
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,228
Respectable citizens
don't steal newspapers.

34
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:32,631
- Come on, it's a lousy two bits.
- That ain't the point.

35
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,950
Put a quarter in the box.

36
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,633
Jeez.

37
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,357
Hey, Arch, get a load of this.

38
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,870
"Gold Coast Flyer
retires after 50 years."

39
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,030
The Flyer?

40
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,754
It's starting its last run
a week from today.

41
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,797
Frisco, LA, San Diego.

42
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,678
What's it say about us?

43
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,989
Well, it says the train was robbed,
but it don't say by whom.

44
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:59,199
The last guys to rob a train?
They don't even mention our names?

45
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,149
Thirty years is a long time.
Might be nobody remembers us.

46
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:06,312
If we'd gotten away with it,
Harry, they'd remember us.

47
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,629
Excuse me?

48
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,920
Harry Doyle and Archie Long?

49
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,594
- Maybe.
- Who wants to know?

50
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,751
I'm Richie Evans.

51
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,032
I've been looking forward
to meeting you guys.

52
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,872
Looking forward to meeting us?

53
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,553
Why is that, son?

54
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,392
I'm your probation officer.

55
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,070
Probation officer?

56
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,470
You always meet parolees
at the prison gate?

57
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:34,430
Well, not ordinarily, but you guys
are not ordinary parolees.

58
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,948
We ain't?

59
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,516
You're the best there was.
I know everything about you guys.

60
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,917
My master's thesis was about
great outlaws of the 20th century.

61
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:46,715
Dillinger, Capone, Pretty Boy Floyd.

62
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,150
When I heard you were up for parole,

63
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:52,676
- I actually asked for your cases.
- You did?

64
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,793
- You're the last of your kind.
- We are.

65
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,679
- I could tell you a story...
- That's in the past.

66
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,593
We're fully rehabilitated now.

67
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,388
That's right.

68
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:07,349
I thought you might need a lift.
That's why I came out here.

69
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,160
Well, that's real nice of you,
Mr Evans.

70
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,191
Call me Richie. OK?

71
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,477
OK, Richie.

72
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,598
I'll go get the car. I'll be right back.

73
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,872
- It's a great beginning, Arch.
- Jeez, things are looking up already.

74
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:45,238
Pardon me, gentlemen.
Are you Harry Doyle and Archie Long?

75
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:49,514
- We've got a fan club, Harry.
- That's us, friend. Who might you be?

76
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:54,590
I might be the guy who's been waiting
30 years just to blow your heads off!

77
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,270
Damn it.

78
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,833
Missed them.

79
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,354
Where the hell are they?

80
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,875
- Arch.
- OK.

81
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,031
- Archie!
- OK!

82
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,390
- Who was that?
- I never saw him before.

83
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,950
- We must've done something.
- A man holds a grudge for 30 years.

84
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:29,192
- Must be pretty bad.
- I'm not gonna go back and ask.

85
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,029
- I was gonna pick you up.
- We thought we'd save you the trip.

86
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,675
- <i>Stop. Thief. Stop. Thief.</i>
- What the hell's that?

87
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,991
It's just a car alarm.

88
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,999
You mind if I drive?

89
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,356
- I just bought this car.
- Don't worry.

90
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:46,950
He hasn't had an accident in 30 years.
Come on, get in.

91
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,119
Take this. There we are.

92
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,069
<i>All monitored systems are functioning.</i>
<i>Please fasten your seat belts.</i>

93
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:56,676
- <i>Please fasten your seat belts.</i>
- I'm doing it. I'm doing it.

94
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:57,989
<i>Thank you.</i>

95
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,918
You sure are in a hurry.

96
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,590
To start our new lives.
We wanna leave the past behind.

97
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,074
Way behind.

98
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,519
<i>Jackrabbit starts</i>
<i>are bad for fuel economy.</i>

99
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:15,957
<i>Fuel economy is maximum</i>
<i>at 55 miles per hour.</i>

100
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,078
- How do you shut this broad up?
- <i>Thank you.</i>

101
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,792
Harry Doyle and Archie Long.

102
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:28,353
I thought those guys
would be dead by now.

103
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,791
What are you doing, Sergeant?

104
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:36,517
I was exploring the exciting new world
of computer technology.

105
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:40,036
Then perhaps you wouldn't mind
exploring the payroll file.

106
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:44,398
- Payroll? I thought you said parole.
- No.

107
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,189
You have to pay attention
if you wanna learn how to do this.

108
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,630
I don't wanna learn how to do this.

109
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:53,070
But you have to. It's your job.

110
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,318
My job is to catch crooks, lady.

111
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,790
I got a couple of major ones here.

112
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,635
Harold Doyle and Archibald Long?
I've never even heard of these guys.

113
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:06,230
Thirty years ago, they were the best
bank robbers in the country.

114
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,038
And I busted them.

115
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,709
Now I'm stuck in this shit job
and they're back on the street,

116
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,879
where I ought to be.

117
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,596
Remember how to do this, Arch?

118
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,870
Not without a mask on.

119
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,758
Harry.

120
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,920
They got cameras now.

121
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,278
That's nice.
We'll have our pictures taken.

122
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,959
I'd like it all in small bills, please.

123
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:40,550
Department of Corrections?
Were you in prison or something?

124
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,190
- I just finished a 30-year stretch.
- Really?

125
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:47,318
- What were you in for?
- Running a red light.

126
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:50,120
They gave you 30 years
for running a light?

127
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:54,552
Well, I was leaving a bank at the time.

128
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,910
Oh.

129
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,434
This driver's licence has expired, sir.

130
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,631
I'll need to see
some current identification.

131
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,478
I don't have anything current.

132
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,435
- How do I know who you are?
- I'm telling you, I'm Harry Doyle.

133
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:13,918
Well, that's very charming, Mr Doyle.
Do you have something with a picture?

134
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,716
Yes, I do. This.

135
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,236
That's me with my brand-new Cadillac.

136
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,550
- Paid 2,000 bucks for that car.
- Swell.

137
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,558
OK, it's a hold-up!

138
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,596
Everybody down! On the floor!

139
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,072
Move! I said, down!

140
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,754
What's the matter? Don't you
speak the language, asshole?

141
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,274
Don't you curse me, boy.

142
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:42,120
Curse you, pops?
I'm gonna blow your head off.

143
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,397
- Stop waving that gun in my face.
- Who's gonna make me?

144
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,874
I am!

145
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,991
Let him go!

146
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,953
I said, let him go!

147
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,229
I'll kill you, man!

148
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:57,273
I was only kidding, grandpa.
Let me go.

149
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,470
Grandpa, huh?

150
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,359
- What are you gonna do?
- Blow his head off.

151
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,033
You don't wanna do that.

152
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,840
- He was disrespectful.
- You just had your suit cleaned.

153
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:09,350
- You'll get brains all over it.
- This punk don't have any brains.

154
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:13,952
Yeah, but there'll be blood.
All red and sticky.

155
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,760
- It'll be messy.
- Get him up.

156
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,313
OK.

157
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,116
This guy's in the wrong business.

158
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,595
They don't make crooks
like they used to.

159
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,159
Jeez, that was amazing!

160
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,550
I can't believe
how you handled these guys.

161
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,995
Just doing what comes naturally.

162
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,798
You're incredible.

163
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,674
How about cashing that cheque, son.

164
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,436
Yes, Mr Doyle.

165
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,360
Furthermore, parolees
are forbidden to carry firearms,

166
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,592
to consort with convicted felons,
to use narcotic substances

167
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:51,718
and must report to this office
once a week for counselling.

168
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,155
All right, now, for some good news.

169
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,356
I've made some
preliminary arrangements.

170
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,875
Archie, I've got
a job placement for you.

171
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:00,914
I got a job already?

172
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:04,152
It doesn't pay a lot,
but it's gonna get you started.

173
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:07,949
And here's a voucher for one
of the welfare hotels in the area.

174
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,189
Welfare?

175
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:13,270
Well, it's just until you get working.
Start drawing an income.

176
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:20,236
Harry, you have a very nice room at
the Golden Sunset Retirement Home.

177
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,993
Retirement?

178
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:28,037
Yeah, and as soon as you sign that,
$435 a month in social security.

179
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,438
But I want to work, too. I've got
strong hands and a strong back.

180
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:35,513
I'm sorry, Harry,
but that's just not possible.

181
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,309
See, after 70,
retirement is mandatory.

182
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,831
Ronald Reagan's older than him
and he's got a job.

183
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:46,709
- That's true. That's true, but...
- I wanna be useful, productive.

184
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:50,119
I can't sit around
no retirement home.

185
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,032
Well, think of it this way.

186
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:55,192
You're gonna have time
to just relax and enjoy life.

187
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,271
Give it a chance, OK?

188
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,072
All right, Richie, if you say so.

189
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:04,279
It won't be so bad, Harry.
I'll be visiting you all the time.

190
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:08,990
We'll have some laughs.
Go to Mickey's for a drink.

191
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,913
Pick up some broads. Huh?

192
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:17,230
I'm afraid that's not going
to be possible either.

193
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,596
- We can't pick up broads?
- No, no.

194
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:25,033
Because of your past relationship,

195
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,154
you won't be allowed to associate.

196
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:36,158
Look, guys, you're ex-cons.

197
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:40,550
You can't see each other
for three years.

198
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:43,149
I'm sorry, but those are the rules.

199
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,110
Three years. He's nuts!

200
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:54,239
They let us associate
for 30 years in prison.

201
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,755
Poles never stopped us.

202
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:00,596
Well, what are we going
to do now, Harry?

203
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:05,868
I think I'll go straight to the home.
Like the kid said, relax and enjoy life.

204
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,388
And I guess I'll go straight to the hotel.

205
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:13,155
Finally get a good night's sleep
without hearing you snore.

206
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,038
Me, snore?

207
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,118
Yeah, you snore.

208
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:21,069
- How come you never said anything?
- I didn't wanna hurt your feelings.

209
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:24,790
You grind your teeth. I'm surprised
they're not stumps by now.

210
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,435
I sure won't miss
your scratchy old records.

211
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,951
And I can do without
your barbells clanking all day.

212
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,754
- So long, Harry.
- So long, Arch.

213
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:41,599
I don't want you playing favourites
with these guys. Understand?

214
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:45,196
I don't care how great you think
they are. They're criminals, felons.

215
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,000
- You treat them like any other case.
- Yes, sir.

216
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:52,113
First sign of trouble, you violate them.
Send them back to the pen.

217
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:55,193
- Do you understand?
- Yes, sir.

218
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:58,553
And get rid of the headlines.

219
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,395
This is a probation office, not a shrine.

220
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,398
- Hello, officer.
- What are you doing, bud?

221
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,989
I'm waiting for a bird to sing.

222
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:35,075
I guess you didn't see that sign
over there that says "No loitering".

223
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,197
Well, loitering is lingering
without a purpose.

224
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,396
I got a purpose.

225
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:42,074
- You gonna give me trouble, Mac?
- No, sir.

226
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:45,353
Now, move it,
before I arrest you and the bird.

227
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,470
- Hi.
- Hi.

228
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:36,998
- Mickey around?
- Mickey?

229
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,271
Yeah, the owner.

230
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,796
Well, he's been dead for 20 years.

231
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,078
Mickey's dead?

232
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,712
- What happened?
- Well, I wouldn't know.

233
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,552
That's a little before my time.

234
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,877
What can I get for you, sir?

235
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,795
I'll have one of those light beers
I heard about.

236
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,552
Mickey's dead.

237
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,156
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

238
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,757
Tastes watery.

239
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:19,154
But it's only 95 calories.
Would you like another?

240
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:23,430
- I'll buy.
- Well, that's damn nice of you, pal.

241
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,716
Don't mind if I do.

242
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:34,311
- Don't you love this music?
- Who doesn't?

243
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,236
- Some people think it's out-of-date.
- Are you kidding?

244
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,791
I grew up on that music.

245
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,920
- It's great dance music.
- Yeah.

246
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,835
I haven't danced in 30 years.

247
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,838
Shall we?

248
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,952
- Shall we what?
- Shall we dance?

249
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,875
- Can't believe it.
- Can't believe what?

250
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:24,355
Harry. Thought you were going
straight to the home.

251
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,279
I thought you were going
straight to your hotel.

252
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,033
I'll buy you a drink.

253
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,669
- You don't wanna go in there.
- Yes, I do.

254
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,480
- No, you don't.
- A lovers' quarrel.

255
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,551
It breaks my heart.

256
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,758
Turn around, worm food.
Start walking.

257
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,958
And don't try anything stupid
or you die right here.

258
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,715
And don't let the goggles fool you,
buster, I'm a sharpshooter.

259
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,958
All right, turn here. Turn!

260
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,679
What is this, a parade?

261
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:54,310
- Where are we going, friend?
- We're going up this alley, friend.

262
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:57,677
- And then what?
- And then I'm coming out.

263
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,478
Alone.

264
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,232
Come back, you bastards!
Let's finish it once and for all!

265
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,914
- Finish it? Finish what?
- It stinks down here!

266
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:17,789
- You sure you don't know him?
- I'm up to my knees in guck!

267
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:20,759
- Could we be losing our memories?
- Could be, Harry.

268
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,558
I'm gonna get pneumonia.

269
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,631
Just look at this place.

270
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,599
This used to be the classiest street
in the neighbourhood.

271
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:32,909
Yeah.

272
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,231
Where are you going, gramps?

273
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:50,910
Excuse me.

274
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:54,675
I asked you...
where you was going, man.

275
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:57,912
- We're going down this street.
- And we don't want any trouble.

276
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,553
So let us pass.

277
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,916
- This street, bro?
- Yeah, this street.

278
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:05,789
The fact is, this happens to be
a private street.

279
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:08,190
It costs a sawbuck
to walk down this street.

280
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:11,150
- A sawbuck?
- All right, then we'll go back.

281
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:15,313
But you don't understand.
You're already on the street.

282
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:18,393
Once you on the street,
you gotta pay the tax.

283
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,834
That's right.

284
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:25,079
You know, Arch, I never met
so many stupid people in one day.

285
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,595
Ugly too.

286
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:32,832
OK, pops, I don't know
how old you is,

287
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:35,071
but you ain't getting any older.

288
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,231
Now, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

289
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:40,040
- This ain't a fair fight.
- There's six of you.

290
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,395
Only two of us.

291
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:44,234
And you got knives
and we got nothing.

292
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,317
But that's how we win.

293
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:52,193
When we lived in this neighbourhood,
there were rules to street fighting.

294
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,833
- Rules?
- Yeah.

295
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,150
Like what kind of rules?

296
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,549
- For one thing, you couldn't do this.
- Or this.

297
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,756
But you could do this!

298
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:07,191
Now, has everyone
got the rules straight?

299
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,629
They don't know shit
about street fighting.

300
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,874
What's the matter?

301
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,397
Never hurt like this before.

302
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,509
Things have changed.

303
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,150
It don't look so bad, huh, Harry?

304
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:37,592
At least it ain't got no guard towers
and no bars on the doors.

305
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:41,277
Hey, look.
You got a saloon across the street.

306
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:44,349
Never had anything like that
in prison, huh?

307
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:49,559
Well, it ain't what I expected,

308
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:52,360
but we have to make
the best of things.

309
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:55,677
That's the spirit.
It'll be a new experience.

310
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:59,239
They never had a guy like you
in this place.

311
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,630
You'll be running this joint in a week.

312
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:06,476
Look at me. I never had an honest job
in my life. I'm looking forward to it.

313
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,950
- Sounds real good, Arch.
- Sure does.

314
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,437
Well, I guess this is it.

315
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,678
Hey,

316
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,116
it's only for three years, Harry.

317
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:21,909
We can do that much time
standing on our heads.

318
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,391
Sure.

319
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:31,276
- So long, Arch.
- So long, Harry.

320
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,393
Hey, Harry?

321
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:44,599
You take care of yourself, OK?

322
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,512
You too, Arch.

323
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55,794
So they're out. So what?

324
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:58,349
A problem for the parole system,
not the police.

325
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:01,034
I busted these guys.
I know how they think.

326
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:04,556
- And believe me, they think crime.
- Give me a break, Yablonski.

327
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:08,793
You got a guy here that's 67.
The other one's 72.

328
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,235
These guys don't think crime.
They think Geritol.

329
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,431
You're wrong, Captain.
You're very wrong.

330
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,477
Don't underestimate these guys.

331
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:18,075
Yablonski, you're in Records now.

332
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,880
You've got a nice, soft job.

333
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,718
You're not a street cop any more.

334
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,997
Put me back on the street.
I can nail these guys.

335
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,389
Yablonski, I'm busy.

336
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:30,029
They won't be committing
any more crimes,

337
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:34,671
so go back to your desk, sit down
and stop bothering me with this shit!

338
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:38,799
They'll go back to crime.
I guarantee it!

339
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:44,040
All they need is a little motivation.

340
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,796
Excuse me.

341
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:14,109
I understand I can get a room here.

342
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:17,670
- Got a reservation?
- No, I don't.

343
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:22,399
- Hey, take it easy.
- He don't feel nothing.

344
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,034
Well, you're in luck.
We just got a vacancy.

345
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:31,033
Cash, credit card or cheque?

346
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:34,909
Well, I have this welfare ticket.

347
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:40,116
Oh, great. Another ex-con.

348
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:43,397
Don't you guys keep
any of the money you steal?

349
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,400
Room 12, top of the stairs.

350
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,670
Twelve. Room 12. You deaf?

351
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,390
Hey, pal.

352
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:00,279
What makes you think
I did time for stealing?

353
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:03,353
OK, wise guy.
What's your claim to fame?

354
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:08,352
I killed six people with an axe.
Just like that one.

355
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:14,518
Don't worry,
doctor says I'm getting much better.

356
00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:00,431
We are eating our lunch today,
aren't we, Mr Doyle?

357
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,513
- Are we?
- It's spinach soufflé.

358
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,671
It's so nutritious.

359
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,275
Really.

360
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:16,472
If you don't eat your food, Mr Doyle,
I'm gonna be very upset.

361
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:22,073
We wouldn't want that
to happen now, would we?

362
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:29,239
Tell the cook we don't like this crud.
We want real food.

363
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:31,869
Real food! Real food!

364
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,991
Real food! Real food!

365
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:36,157
Real food! Real food!

366
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,874
Real food! Real food! Real food!

367
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:43,312
Real food! Real food!
Real food! Real food! Real food!

368
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,315
What'll it be, sport?

369
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:56,518
- Let me have a strawberry yoghurt.
- Coming right up.

370
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,278
No, chocolate.

371
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,272
No, strawberry.

372
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:04,835
Take your time
and make up your mind.

373
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,433
I have made it up.

374
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,557
Well, do you want
strawberry or chocolate?

375
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:09,829
Amaretto.

376
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:16,110
Hey, that's gelati.
I asked you for yoghurt.

377
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,199
Boob.

378
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:20,590
What's the difference?
Looks the same to me.

379
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:24,753
Gelati's made out of cream.
Yoghurt's made out of bacteria culture.

380
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,235
Where have you been?
A cave?

381
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,076
That'll be a buck sixty.

382
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,879
- What's the matter?
- What about my toppings?

383
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:42,192
You're supposed to ask me
what kind of toppings I want.

384
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:46,718
- What kind of toppings you want?
- Do you have Peanut M&M's?

385
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:54,559
Hey, I didn't say I wanted M&M's,
I just asked if you had any.

386
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,995
- Yeah, we got them.
- I don't want them.

387
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,398
Do you have Oreo pieces?

388
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,756
- You want them?
- That's why I asked.

389
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:11,036
And walnuts, too.
Not peanuts. Walnuts.

390
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,118
And jellybeans.

391
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:17,957
No, not M&M's. I hate M&M's.
Jellybeans.

392
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,396
And almonds instead of walnuts.

393
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,993
OK.

394
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:30,032
Forget it. I'll just have it plain.

395
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:39,955
You still want it?

396
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:43,471
Of course, what do you think
I came in for?

397
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,992
You got it, kid.

398
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,989
We're senior citizens,
not school children.

399
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:57,074
We want real food, not that pig slop
you can suck through a straw.

400
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,759
Really.

401
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,117
Well, our dietary programme
is no concern of yours, Mr Doyle.

402
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:06,552
We want steaks, chops,
roast beef rare, blood rare.

403
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:09,792
Don't be ridiculous. Most people
out there don't even have teeth.

404
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:13,038
Oh, really?
Well, what do you call these?

405
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,437
Same old Harry Doyle.

406
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:25,154
You just can't stay
out of trouble, can you?

407
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,672
Belle Burgess.

408
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,319
I can't believe my eyes.

409
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:34,109
I mean, what's a dame like you
doing in a joint like this?

410
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,630
- Earning a living.
- You work here?

411
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:38,797
Room and board and $120 a month.

412
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:43,158
I teach a couple of aerobics classes,
tap class, if anyone shows up.

413
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,634
You quit show business.

414
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:48,230
There's not much call
for 60-year-old showgirls.

415
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:52,189
- I'd hire you in a minute.
- Thanks, Harry, you're sweet.

416
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,789
Anyway, it's better than standing

417
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:58,600
behind the lingerie counter
at Penney's.

418
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,631
What are you doing here, Harry?

419
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,598
I live here, unfortunately.

420
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:08,196
I don't know for how long.
Too many rules to suit me.

421
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:11,034
Since when did that
make a difference?

422
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:15,273
- When did you get out?
- Yesterday. Me and Archie.

423
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:18,518
I'm in Room 321. Come up for a visit.

424
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:21,479
We could talk about old times.

425
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:24,157
I'd like that.

426
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:29,192
Holy mackerel.

427
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:33,240
Penguin. Stupid job.

428
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:35,550
Getting fired, me? I ought to quit.

429
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:41,070
What kind of business is that anyway?
Selling bacteria to children.

430
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,552
Can I help you, sir?

431
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:15,719
- Where's the gym, miss?
- This is the gym.

432
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,231
- No, no. I mean the men's gym.
- Oh, we're coed now.

433
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,119
Showers, too?

434
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,952
No, not the showers.
Are you here to work out?

435
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:29,752
I don't know.
This place looks kind of expensive.

436
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:32,429
No sweat.
First session's free.

437
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,915
- Great.
- Come on.

438
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:06,072
- Want me to help you get it up?
- No, thanks.

439
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,311
I can get it up.

440
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,556
I guess I couldn't.

441
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,558
You OK?

442
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:25,396
Yeah, I haven't been
feeling too well lately.

443
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:27,870
Probably a virus or something.

444
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:31,157
I guess it took more
out of me than I thought.

445
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,637
Yeah, I know what you mean.

446
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:37,391
Anyway, it's nice to have
a real man around.

447
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:40,518
Usually, there's nothing but gays.

448
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:45,836
- You're not gay, are you?
- Gay, are you kidding?

449
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:48,036
I just lost my job, I'm miserable.

450
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:54,031
That's funny.

451
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:56,191
You're a funny guy.

452
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:01,037
- I'm Skye. Who are you?
- Archie Long.

453
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:04,909
- Pleased to meet you, Skye.
- Pleased to meet you, too.

454
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:07,628
You're in pretty good shape,
Archie Long.

455
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,477
Pretty good yourself.

456
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,319
You come here a lot?

457
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,755
I have to. I run the place.

458
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:22,229
Maybe we should work out
together sometime.

459
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,948
Sure. Anytime you say.

460
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:28,110
- How about tonight?
- Fine with me.

461
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:30,999
I didn't think the gym
was open at night.

462
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:34,949
It isn't, but there are other ways
to work up a sweat.

463
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:43,714
Meet me at The Chainsaw
on Spring Street, 10 o'clock, OK?

464
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:46,793
The Chainsaw? What's that?

465
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,271
- It's a club.
- What do you do there?

466
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,433
You dance.

467
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,591
What should I wear?

468
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,391
Just look hot.

469
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,553
Hot.

470
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:06,712
- Now, who the hell is that?
- Harry Doyle.

471
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:10,589
- Did I ever look that young?
- Did I?

472
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:13,513
You? You haven't changed a bit.

473
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:16,752
- In fact, you look better now.
- Well, that's sweet, Harry.

474
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,718
It's a lie, but it's sweet.

475
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:24,114
- I can't get over you keeping all this.
- Well, I have a thing for old memories.

476
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:27,113
Perhaps you'd step out
with an old memory like me?

477
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,715
Thought you'd never ask.

478
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,671
<i>Can I help you?</i>

479
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,437
<i>Behind you, sir.</i>

480
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:16,635
- Are you talking to me?
- <i>There's nobody else here.</i>

481
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:20,557
<i>I'm Derek. Can I help you?</i>

482
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,557
Well, I need something to wear.

483
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:27,116
- <i>I need more information.</i>
- Like what?

484
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:29,954
<i>Colour. Style. Function.</i>

485
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:35,071
- I got a date.
- <i>Male? Female?</i>

486
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,356
- I got a date with a gorgeous broad.
- <i>Thank you.</i>

487
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:43,356
<i>Evening? Morning?</i>
<i>Formal? Casual?</i>

488
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:46,319
<i>Please, be as specific as possible.</i>

489
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:50,348
Chainsaw, Spring Street, 10 p.m.

490
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:54,876
She said, "Look hot."
How about something in blue?

491
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:59,632
<i>Blue is cold, sir. Red is hot.</i>

492
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,354
OK, something in red.

493
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,631
<i>We don't carry red, sir.</i>

494
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:10,750
<i>Our colours are peach, lime, cherry,</i>
<i>mocha, almond and avocado.</i>

495
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:14,953
I don't wanna eat the suit,
I just wanna wear it.

496
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:17,756
<i>One moment, sir.</i>

497
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:58,315
- Well, Derek, am I hot?
- <i>You're practically on fire.</i>

498
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,233
Come in.

499
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:14,395
My, you look snazzy.

500
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:16,948
Oh.

501
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:19,911
Flowers, Harry.

502
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,836
Oh, they're beautiful.

503
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:25,995
Nobody's given me flowers in years.

504
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,832
Let's get out, paint the town.

505
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:30,514
We'll start with Serro's.
I'll get our old table.

506
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:33,115
Serro's is gone.
It's a comedy club now.

507
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,994
- Well, the Derby, then.
- Torn down.

508
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:40,273
- Romanoff's? Earl Carol's?
- Sorry, they're gone, too.

509
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:43,438
There's gotta be some place left.

510
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:19,469
- I love your suit, Arch.
- Just something I had lying around.

511
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:24,393
<i>Because of you</i>

512
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:29,634
<i>There's a song in my heart</i>

513
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,275
<i>Because of you</i>

514
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:37,436
<i>My romance had its start</i>

515
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:41,349
Jimmy Lennon. Good old Jimmy.

516
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:45,790
- Still sounds good, don't you think?
- Sounds good to me.

517
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:51,313
Well, the food ain't bad
and the champagne's good.

518
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:54,313
The company's swell.
The best things never change.

519
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,357
<i>Cin cin.</i>

520
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:05,074
- How about a dance?
- Love to.

521
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:15,798
What's the name of that band?

522
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:18,110
The Red Hot Chili Peppers.

523
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:22,148
- You like them?
- Yeah, I got all their albums.

524
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:29,993
<i>It's paradise to be near you</i>

525
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:32,834
<i>Like this</i>

526
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:35,831
Remember the last time
we danced together?

527
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:37,752
Yes, I do.

528
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:42,118
July 4, 1955,
on Mickey Cohen's yacht.

529
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:45,552
You wore a blue dress.

530
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,950
You were the prettiest girl
in the bunch.

531
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:50,395
I didn't think you'd remember.

532
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:54,674
Hardly a day in the last 30 years
I haven't thought of that weekend.

533
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:55,909
Really.

534
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:06,477
Hey, watch it.

535
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:10,318
Hey, I said, watch it.

536
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:12,630
That's cool, man.
Come on, slam me.

537
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:14,233
Slam me!

538
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:23,233
You know, dancing's more fun
than I remember.

539
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:24,830
Smoking!

540
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:32,794
How am I doing?

541
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:39,196
<i>Set it straight forever</i>
<i>Better late than never</i>

542
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:42,755
What music!

543
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,036
And the dancing.

544
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,150
It's more like boxing!

545
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:53,514
I gotta tell Harry about this.

546
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:57,600
- You really miss him, don't you?
- Who?

547
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:59,836
That guy you were just
talking about, Harry.

548
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:03,993
No, are you kidding?
I'm having a ball.

549
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:08,875
What's those things
we were drinking anyway?

550
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:11,395
Those were kamikazes.

551
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:14,959
They ought to
put more booze in them.

552
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:22,759
Hey, what are you doing?

553
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,150
I'm the man. I'm supposed to do that.

554
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:28,995
You have to save your strength.
It's going to be a long night.

555
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:30,958
Yeah.

556
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:49,190
- What you got there?
- Carrot juice.

557
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:50,714
Carrot juice?

558
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:53,997
I used to have a Scotch
after we made love, remember?

559
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:58,790
- Scotch is poison, Harry.
- Oh, not to me it ain't.

560
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:01,954
- I'll bet you still eat red meat.
- Yep.

561
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:04,395
- Dairy products?
- Sometimes.

562
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:06,949
- Well, I eat nothing but roughage.
- Roughage?

563
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:09,668
It's like Drano.
Keeps the pipes clear.

564
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:10,830
Have some.

565
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:14,516
No, thanks. I don't want no Drano.
I want Scotch.

566
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:19,430
I take 20 vitamin
and mineral supplements a day.

567
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:23,229
- Really?
- Aerobics five times a week.

568
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:26,517
Staying young
is a serious business, Harry.

569
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:28,034
You know, Belle,

570
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:30,999
I'm beginning to think
that old is a dirty word.

571
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:35,679
- Well, nobody likes being old.
- I don't mind.

572
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:40,640
Mr Doyle, it is well past lights.

573
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:42,759
What's going on in here?

574
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:46,273
Nothing.

575
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:48,709
At the moment.

576
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:52,396
Disgusting.

577
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:57,837
Harry, you're not gonna believe this.

578
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:01,072
I met a girl.
She can't keep her hands off me.

579
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:04,630
- <i>How much did you pay her?</i>
- I didn't have to pay her.

580
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:08,190
She's crazy about me.
All she wants to do is make love.

581
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:10,317
Archie.

582
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:12,234
<i>Hello?</i>

583
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:17,113
I gotta go, Harry.
Something just came up.

584
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:23,195
I got a call from Gladys Ripps
at the home today, Harry.

585
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:27,069
She said you were being
a disruptive influence.

586
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:30,073
She said that you refused
to eat your lunch

587
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:32,675
and that you made love to a woman.

588
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:34,513
Is that right, Harry?

589
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:37,479
You make love to women,
don't you, Richie?

590
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:39,358
Well, yeah, sure.

591
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:42,956
How come when you do it,
you're a stud,

592
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:45,760
and when I do it,
I'm a disruptive influence?

593
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:48,031
Because I'm 28, Harry.

594
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,673
Look, I understand how you feel.

595
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:55,717
Most people don't.

596
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:58,554
And if you want to fit into society,

597
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:02,110
you have to behave
in a way that is accepted.

598
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:04,635
Isn't that what we all want, Harry?

599
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:06,029
To be accepted?

600
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:13,999
I'm 72. I can still make love
to a woman if I like her.

601
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:16,271
I like this lady very much.

602
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:20,954
Are you suggesting I stop
being a man just so I can fit in?

603
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:23,196
Is that what you mean?

604
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:35,272
- I just wished you'd come to me first.
- I offered to wash the kid's face.

605
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:38,318
Give him a free agoodi,
or whatever you call it.

606
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:40,471
You have to control your temper.

607
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:42,836
You can't shove yoghurt
in everybody's face.

608
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:44,479
Arch?

609
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:49,070
Richie, darling!

610
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:54,034
How marvellous to see you!

611
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:56,555
- Hi, Sandy.
- And you must be Archie.

612
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:58,392
Richie's told me all about you.

613
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:00,238
- <i>Enchantée.</i>
- Likewise.

614
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:04,954
Well, I've gotta run, so I'll leave
you two to work out the details.

615
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:07,395
- Good luck, Arch.
- Thanks, Richie.

616
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:10,916
<i>Ciao,</i> darling.
Call, we'll do something soon.

617
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:12,752
Sandy, I really appreciate...

618
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,433
Can it, Long.

619
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:16,511
Let's get one thing straight.

620
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:19,672
My father was a cop.
I don't like ex-cons.

621
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:23,356
The only reason I let you in
here is because I owe Richie.

622
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:27,149
If I catch you with your fingers
anywhere near the cash register,

623
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:29,550
I'll cut your balls off.

624
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:32,509
- You got it?
- Yes, ma'am.

625
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:36,310
Why don't you grab a mop.
The toilet's backed up again.

626
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:48,157
Archie.

627
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:51,632
I'm waiting.

628
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:54,433
Again?

629
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:58,428
What does she think, I'm 18?

630
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:12,555
OK, mister, let's go.

631
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:14,552
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Helping you.

632
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:16,677
- I don't need help.
- It's my job.

633
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:18,194
Oh, wait a minute, son.

634
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:21,318
If you don't let go, I'll break your arm.

635
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:24,154
I'm just doing a good deed, old fart.

636
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:27,318
Come on, huh?

637
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:34,596
Goddamn tunnel of love.

638
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:38,278
Don't you worry, Vinnie.
A deal is a deal.

639
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:40,715
Leon B Little never quits.

640
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:44,551
There are 26 stiffs out there
who swear to that.

641
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:46,872
Oh, daylight.

642
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:49,509
All right, you chicken livers.

643
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:53,673
If you're out there,
you can kiss your future goodbye.

644
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:07,951
Hey, Michael Jackson.

645
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:12,276
Did you see two elderly gentlemen
pass this way recently?

646
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:14,636
Holy shit! Another one!

647
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:19,996
What is it, my smell or something?

648
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:23,750
Hey, pissant!
You forgot your jukebox!

649
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:29,155
I hate noise pollution.

650
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:39,996
How's it going, Archibald?

651
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:45,436
Well, well.
If it ain't Deke Yablonski.

652
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:49,109
Glad to see you kept in good shape.

653
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:51,920
The great Archie Long
working as a busboy.

654
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:55,877
- It's a temporary job.
- Of course it is.

655
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:59,192
They'll move you up to dishwasher
before you know it.

656
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:01,749
Get lost, Yablonski. I'm busy.

657
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:05,112
Of course, you've probably got
lots of dirty dishes to scrape.

658
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:07,960
Ketchup bottles to fill, napkins to fold.

659
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:11,592
I wouldn't want to keep you
from such important work.

660
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:17,229
I'm proud of you, Arch.

661
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:26,073
Long. Hurry up.
Table five needs clearing.

662
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:31,274
Hey, can I get a steak knife over here?

663
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:32,953
Steak knife, right away.

664
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:35,475
Excuse me, I could use some water.

665
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:39,110
- H2O, if it's not too much trouble.
- Coming right up.

666
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:43,319
Yo, pops, how about that bread we
ordered about 20 minutes ago, huh?

667
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:45,152
- I'll get it.
- Right.

668
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:47,792
Where'd they dig this guy up?

669
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:51,117
Have you cleared table five yet?
I got people waiting.

670
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:53,351
- I was getting to it.
- Well, move it.

671
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:56,751
This is not a rest home.
You've got a job to do.

672
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,399
Yes, ma'am.

673
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:04,235
- Here's your bread.
- It's about...

674
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:06,436
H2O, madame.

675
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:15,159
Here's your steak knife, sir.

676
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:19,000
Clearing table number five.

677
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:24,555
Anybody else want anything?

678
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:32,070
<i>We are going to explore ways</i>
<i>to get more enjoyment from sex.</i>

679
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:35,039
<i>We are going to look at masturbation,</i>
<i>intercourse, fantasy.</i>

680
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:36,554
<i>We'll talk about orgasm.</i>

681
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:39,752
<i>Examine some problems</i>
<i>in therapy sessions.</i>

682
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,433
<i>And we'll have fun</i>

683
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:47,272
<i>because sex is a celebration</i>
<i>of life, of joy, of the body, and I...</i>

684
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:51,028
OK, boys and girls, the party's over.

685
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:53,551
It's way past your bedtimes.

686
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:57,315
Now let's go. Come on.
Here we go. To the rooms.

687
00:52:57,600 --> 00:52:59,875
Brush those teeth.
Let's rock 'n' roll, Gert.

688
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:01,435
Let's do it.

689
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:04,640
Lights out at 10, gang.

690
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:10,919
You got a problem with that,
Mr Doyle?

691
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:40,875
- You're not dressed.
- Yeah.

692
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:44,510
- Come on. We're gonna be late.
- You go ahead without me.

693
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:46,148
But you gotta come.

694
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:49,198
- You're the life of the party.
- Not tonight.

695
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:51,830
What happened to your hair?

696
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:54,435
- You all right?
- Sure.

697
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:00,994
- Is there anything I can do?
- No, no. I'm just tired, that's all.

698
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:03,959
You go ahead. Have a good time.
You look terrific.

699
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:05,838
I'll be fine.

700
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:07,719
You sure?

701
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:10,357
Sure, I'm sure.

702
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:21,273
Archie.

703
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:27,600
Are you gonna be here
when I get back?

704
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:30,433
I don't think so.

705
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:32,988
Why?

706
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:37,039
Look, Skye, you're a swell kid,

707
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:39,676
but I gotta start acting my age.

708
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:42,677
I understand.

709
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:47,513
We did have a good time, though,
didn't we?

710
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:51,629
I wouldn't have missed it
for the world.

711
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:03,159
Hey, if you change your mind,

712
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:05,994
you know where to find me, huh?

713
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:09,157
Chainsaw.

714
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:11,638
Right.

715
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:21,869
<i>This weekend marks the end of</i>
<i>an era as the G|old Coast Flyer,</i>

716
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:23,792
<i>pride of the Southern Pacific Railroad,</i>

717
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:26,508
<i>makes its final journey</i>
<i>into the pages of history.</i>

718
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:29,758
<i>For those of us</i>
<i>more familiar with air travel,</i>

719
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:33,430
<i>the G|old Coast Flyer</i>
<i>may not seem like much.</i>

720
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:36,148
<i>But for those who remember</i>
<i>a more relaxed time,</i>

721
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:38,755
<i>a ride on the Flyer</i>
<i>was something special.</i>

722
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:42,398
Hey, don't turn that off.
That's the Gold Coast Flyer.

723
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:45,791
- Me and Archie robbed that train.
- Sure you did, pal.

724
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:50,830
Goddamn it, we did.
July 23, 1955. That's the day.

725
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:54,152
That's the last time anybody
robbed a train in this country.

726
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:58,757
- Take it easy, old-timer, I believe you.
- Old-timer, huh?

727
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:02,674
I'll show you who's old.
Come on. Arm-wrestle me.

728
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:04,717
Relax, you're gonna
have a heart attack.

729
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:08,475
- Come on. Come on. I dare you.
- Mind if I try?

730
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:12,228
Well, I'm a son of a bitch.

731
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:14,630
If it ain't another son of a bitch.

732
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:18,071
Deke Yablonski.
We thought you was dead.

733
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:22,232
You're looking pretty good, though.
I see you're eating good.

734
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,752
You still patrolling, are you?

735
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,719
No, when I busted you two bums,
I made sergeant.

736
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:30,872
Sergeant.
Well, I'll be a monkey's uncle.

737
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:34,430
Hey, give us another one
of them dirty glasses for this guy.

738
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:38,679
- He's a bigtime sergeant now.
- I don't wanna drink with you, Doyle.

739
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:41,639
- Besides, I'm on duty.
- On duty?

740
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:44,356
What the hell does that mean?

741
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:47,319
You thinking of busting us again,
is that it?

742
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:49,312
Don't make me laugh.

743
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:54,837
I know your kind, Doyle.
Once a thief, always a thief.

744
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:57,310
Sooner or later,
you'll make your move,

745
00:56:57,560 --> 00:57:01,109
and I'm gonna be all over you
like flies on a turd.

746
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:03,391
Still talking shit, ain't you, Yablonski?

747
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:08,316
Why don't you be a nice fellow and
get the hell out of here, you fat slob.

748
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:13,312
Now you're real tough, Doyle.
You scare me.

749
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:16,948
Maybe you'd like to take a sock at me.

750
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:18,833
Is that it?

751
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:22,908
- That it, Doyle?
- Don't do that.

752
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:26,237
Maybe you ain't got the guts
without your fag friend around.

753
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:29,119
All right, Yablonski, that does it.

754
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:33,518
Come on, old man. I'm waiting.

755
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:36,071
Lights out, fatso.

756
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:43,551
Ah, Yablonski.

757
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:48,112
I'll show you who's old,
you dirty, fat slob.

758
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:53,318
Let's go home, Harry.

759
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,513
How you feeling?

760
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:41,799
Lousy.

761
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:51,632
I guess I ain't got the stomach
for booze any more.

762
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:00,311
So this is it, huh?

763
00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:04,357
- Nice.
- It stinks.

764
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:09,110
What happened last night?

765
00:59:10,560 --> 00:59:12,278
How'd I get home?

766
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:16,911
You walked home, I guess.
I just came in a few minutes ago.

767
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:22,190
What the hell are you doing here?
I thought you was working.

768
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:25,833
- I quit.
- You quit?

769
00:59:26,080 --> 00:59:27,399
Couldn't take it any more.

770
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:30,632
Being treated like dirt
ever since I got out of jail.

771
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:34,509
Sweeping out toilets,
scraping crud off dishes,

772
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:37,553
my girlfriend trying
to kill me with sex

773
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:41,679
and I'm dressing like Bozo
the Clown just to fit in.

774
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:46,237
I don't wanna fit in any more.

775
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:48,799
That makes two of us.

776
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:53,839
Listen, Harry,

777
00:59:55,320 --> 00:59:58,357
let's go back to doing
something we really like doing.

778
00:59:59,080 --> 01:00:01,878
You mean like robbing and stealing?

779
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:07,159
We could put the gang back together.

780
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:09,351
Just like the old days.

781
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:13,792
Come on.

782
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:17,678
Want to start with the bank
that cashed our cheques?

783
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:20,156
Anything you say, Harry.

784
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:55,316
- Two for lunch?
- No, ma'am.

785
01:00:55,560 --> 01:00:58,233
I'm looking for Jimmy Ellis.
He around?

786
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:00,391
His booth's over there.

787
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:12,908
- Harry Doyle.
- Hello, Jimmy.

788
01:01:13,160 --> 01:01:14,957
Archie Long.

789
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:17,438
Son of a gun.

790
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:21,434
- Jeez, how long's it been?
- Too long.

791
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:24,632
- What?
- Too long, Jimmy.

792
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:27,792
You guys know my bodyguard, Vince?

793
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:32,755
So is this business
or pleasure or what?

794
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:34,996
Business.

795
01:01:35,240 --> 01:01:38,073
Vince, blow.

796
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:40,638
Sit down.

797
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:42,235
You want lunch?

798
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:44,357
- They make a decent club.
- No, no.

799
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:46,511
- We're looking for the guys.
- Huh?

800
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:49,354
- We're looking for the guys.
- Which guys?

801
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:51,272
I know lots of guys.

802
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:55,593
Three Finger Brown, Malt Donovan
and Philly the Mouse.

803
01:01:55,840 --> 01:02:00,118
- That's right.
- Oh, you wanna get a-hold of the gang.

804
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:04,270
What you got, a stick-up?
Hey, you need pieces?

805
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:08,074
No, no. We just need the gang.

806
01:02:09,080 --> 01:02:11,878
- Oh. Hey, Vince!
- What?

807
01:02:12,120 --> 01:02:14,236
- Where's Philly?
- Pennsylvania.

808
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:16,636
No, no, Philly the Mouse.

809
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:19,519
Harry and Archie need him
for a stick-up.

810
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:21,677
He's in the bar.

811
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:23,592
Thanks, Jimmy.

812
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:40,034
Well, I'll be.

813
01:02:40,680 --> 01:02:44,229
Harry Doyle and Archie Long.

814
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:46,711
- When did you get out?
- Week ago.

815
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:48,951
- Did you crash out?
- Paroled.

816
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:51,111
Nice.

817
01:02:51,360 --> 01:02:53,715
How would you like
to go back to work?

818
01:02:54,120 --> 01:02:57,192
Would I? Gee, would I ever.

819
01:02:57,480 --> 01:02:59,630
- What's the score?
- Bank.

820
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:01,713
Nice.

821
01:03:01,960 --> 01:03:03,678
- You guys been inside?
- Yep.

822
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:07,153
- Give me numbers.
- Plenty. For everybody.

823
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:10,037
Nice.

824
01:03:10,280 --> 01:03:12,475
- How we going in?
- Heavy.

825
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:14,478
We figure three minutes.

826
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:17,320
We take the cash drawers.
Harry takes the vault.

827
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:19,079
Nice.

828
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:22,198
- Who's the wheelman?
- Gotta be Eddie Masanti.

829
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:25,233
- The best.
- He's got arthritis.

830
01:03:25,480 --> 01:03:27,357
- Dick Schultz is much better.
- Kraut?

831
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:30,109
- Yeah.
- But we heard he was on the lam.

832
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:33,119
- Yeah.
- No, I just talked to him today.

833
01:03:33,360 --> 01:03:35,555
He's got a room at the Piedmont Hotel.

834
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:37,313
Here we go, Philly.

835
01:03:39,560 --> 01:03:41,790
- OK.
- There we go, baby.

836
01:03:43,840 --> 01:03:45,558
Thank you, toots.

837
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:48,514
Hold it, toots.

838
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:52,116
Guys, that deal we were discussing.

839
01:03:52,360 --> 01:03:54,271
Nice.

840
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:00,677
Mr Evans?

841
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:02,672
Yes, can I help you?

842
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:05,110
I hope so.

843
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:09,960
- Where are they?
- Where are who?

844
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:14,478
Harry Doyle and Archie Long.
Who do you think, puke-head?

845
01:04:15,720 --> 01:04:18,678
- I don't know who you're talking about.
- Don't give me crap.

846
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:20,990
You're their parole officer.
Now, where are they?

847
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:23,919
I can't tell you that.
It's privileged information.

848
01:04:24,520 --> 01:04:26,750
- Privileged?
- Yes.

849
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,275
What do you wanna know for?

850
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:33,230
Because I'm gonna make
dog meat out of them, that's why.

851
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:35,791
Now, where are they?

852
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:41,516
You can kill me if you want,
but I'm not gonna talk.

853
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:45,435
Harry and Archie are my friends.

854
01:04:50,560 --> 01:04:52,915
You'll never make it, dip-shit.

855
01:04:53,160 --> 01:04:54,957
Sit.

856
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:04,672
You put Harry into a retirement home?
Ain't you got respect for the bastard?

857
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:07,952
- I'm not the one trying to kill him.
- You're not, huh?

858
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:11,795
The only difference between you
and me is that my way is quicker.

859
01:05:13,040 --> 01:05:15,793
Get your coat on.
We're getting out of here.

860
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:24,953
- Yeah.
- Ruggs?

861
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:28,272
- Who wants to know?
- Harry Doyle and Archie Long.

862
01:05:28,520 --> 01:05:29,714
Open up.

863
01:05:33,320 --> 01:05:35,515
Yeah, sure, just a second.

864
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:42,153
Hi, Kraut.

865
01:05:42,440 --> 01:05:44,192
- Get them up.
- Get them up.

866
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:46,351
- Up, I said.
- Get them up.

867
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:48,750
Relax, Vito.

868
01:05:49,120 --> 01:05:52,271
- You coppers finally tracked me down.
- Coppers?

869
01:05:52,520 --> 01:05:55,080
- It's me, Harry, and Archie.
- Don't you remember us?

870
01:05:55,280 --> 01:05:57,999
What do you take me for, a mug?
They're dead.

871
01:05:58,240 --> 01:06:01,596
You cops are so dumb,
it's almost a crime to kill you.

872
01:06:01,840 --> 01:06:03,398
Turn around.

873
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:06,673
- I said, turn around.
- Screw you.

874
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:08,473
- Turn around.
- Screw you, too.

875
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:09,875
What?

876
01:06:10,120 --> 01:06:13,112
Harry Doyle and Archie Long
don't take it in the back.

877
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:16,318
Have it your own way, tough guys.

878
01:06:22,920 --> 01:06:24,194
You guys.

879
01:06:27,120 --> 01:06:30,908
The look on your faces.
You should have seen it.

880
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:36,634
Pow, it says, pow.

881
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:40,599
Spelled backwards, wop.

882
01:06:53,120 --> 01:06:55,680
<i>1 Adam 27, please respond.</i>

883
01:06:56,640 --> 01:06:57,834
1 Adam 27.

884
01:06:58,120 --> 01:07:00,588
This is Jarvis.
What the hell are you doing?

885
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:02,438
Eating lunch, sir.

886
01:07:02,680 --> 01:07:04,875
Bullshit, Yablonski,
I know what you're doing.

887
01:07:05,160 --> 01:07:08,709
<i>If you're not back in 10 minutes, you're</i>
<i>eating your retirement dinner tonight.</i>

888
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:10,473
Yes, sir.

889
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:13,597
Son of a bitch.

890
01:07:18,840 --> 01:07:22,389
Cripples, crazies.
What the hell happened?

891
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:24,790
Everybody got old all of a sudden.

892
01:07:27,160 --> 01:07:28,878
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

893
01:07:29,120 --> 01:07:30,439
It's afternoon, tussle neck.

894
01:07:30,680 --> 01:07:33,114
- You're hurting my arm.
- So what?

895
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:35,153
All right, move.

896
01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:38,077
210. Open this door.

897
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:42,996
Hey, Jane Fonda.

898
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:46,192
- Where's Harry Doyle?
- Who are you?

899
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:48,349
I'm his parole officer.

900
01:07:48,600 --> 01:07:50,591
- I'm his parole off...
- Shut up.

901
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:59,152
- I warn you, I know karate.
- I warn you, I know Winchester.

902
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:07,033
Things ain't working out
too good, Harry.

903
01:08:07,640 --> 01:08:10,108
Can't rob a bank without a gang.

904
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:14,229
- We'll try something else.
- Yeah, like what?

905
01:08:24,120 --> 01:08:26,588
- Harry.
- Now, wait a minute, Archie.

906
01:08:26,840 --> 01:08:30,628
- We never robbed an armoured truck.
- It's like a bank, only it's got wheels.

907
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:33,030
- Yeah, but the tellers have guns.
- So what?

908
01:08:33,280 --> 01:08:36,670
I'll kick the guard in the nuts,
you knock him over the head.

909
01:08:36,920 --> 01:08:37,989
Piece of cake.

910
01:08:38,920 --> 01:08:40,194
Let's go.

911
01:08:43,280 --> 01:08:45,430
Archie, Archie. Hang on a second.

912
01:08:45,680 --> 01:08:46,954
Hold it.

913
01:08:49,240 --> 01:08:51,959
- That's the dumbest idea I ever heard.
- No, it ain't.

914
01:08:52,200 --> 01:08:55,795
- Yes, it is. I ain't gonna do it.
- I'll do it alone, then.

915
01:08:56,040 --> 01:08:57,029
Put that away.

916
01:08:57,280 --> 01:09:01,159
- You'll get your damn head blown off.
- You got a better idea?

917
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:03,399
I'm listening.

918
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:12,714
All right, follow my lead.
And don't kick nobody in the nuts.

919
01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:16,074
Anything you say, Harry.

920
01:09:29,160 --> 01:09:32,630
- I don't feel so good, Arch.
- What's the matter?

921
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:35,348
- There's a pain in my chest.
- Serious?

922
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:39,275
- I can't breathe.
- Harry, don't die on me.

923
01:09:40,480 --> 01:09:43,278
Somebody, help me.

924
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:46,036
My buddy's dying of a heart attack.

925
01:09:46,320 --> 01:09:48,470
- I ain't a doctor.
- You gotta do something.

926
01:09:48,720 --> 01:09:52,190
- What do you want me to do?
- Start by giving him your gun.

927
01:09:54,280 --> 01:09:56,032
Tell the driver to open up.

928
01:09:56,280 --> 01:09:59,636
- He won't until Pete comes...
- Tell him you got a heart attack victim.

929
01:09:59,880 --> 01:10:01,791
An old man, dying.

930
01:10:11,480 --> 01:10:13,516
And you said we couldn't do it, huh?

931
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:15,512
Together we can do anything.

932
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:18,320
I'm not too proud to admit
it was your idea.

933
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:21,154
Or too modest to remind you
it was my plan.

934
01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:23,550
Anything you say, Harry.

935
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:26,439
Hey, how about a little travelling music.

936
01:10:28,280 --> 01:10:30,748
- Shall we dance?
- Why not.

937
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:49,591
A roll of quarters.

938
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:54,356
Believe it, Harry?
One lousy roll of quarters.

939
01:10:55,240 --> 01:10:57,959
I got more than that out
of the newspaper stands.

940
01:10:58,240 --> 01:11:00,959
Let's face it, Arch. We blew it.

941
01:11:01,880 --> 01:11:04,713
No, we didn't.
We stole the truck, didn't we?

942
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:08,839
- We swiped an empty truck.
- So, how are we supposed to know?

943
01:11:09,080 --> 01:11:12,595
- 30 years ago, we'd have known.
- This is just a dry run.

944
01:11:12,840 --> 01:11:16,719
- Next time, we'll know better.
- There ain't gonna be no next time.

945
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:21,071
Are you saying we quit?
We just got started.

946
01:11:21,320 --> 01:11:22,719
We're kidding ourselves, Arch.

947
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:25,679
Why don't we just forget
about it and go home.

948
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:26,955
Pretend it never happened.

949
01:11:27,240 --> 01:11:30,516
<i>Here's more on that armoured truck</i>
<i>robbery in downtown this afternoon.</i>

950
01:11:30,760 --> 01:11:32,637
They're talking about us.

951
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:34,518
<i>According to the truck guards,</i>

952
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:37,394
<i>the two bandits acted</i>
<i>with such speed and agility,</i>

953
01:11:37,640 --> 01:11:41,792
<i>police now believe they were young</i>
<i>men disguised as senior citizens.</i>

954
01:11:42,040 --> 01:11:44,600
Disguised?
We didn't wear no disguises.

955
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:48,475
<i>However, despite their agility,</i>
<i>the bandits came up empty-handed</i>

956
01:11:48,720 --> 01:11:50,915
<i>because they stole an empty truck.</i>

957
01:11:51,200 --> 01:11:53,350
<i>Better luck next time, guys.</i>

958
01:11:53,960 --> 01:11:56,110
- They're laughing at us.
- <i>Back to the show.</i>

959
01:11:56,360 --> 01:11:58,555
- Who cares?
- I care.

960
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:08,390
All right, Archie,
what do you want us to do?

961
01:12:09,560 --> 01:12:12,120
Steal another empty armoured truck?
Maybe start a collection?

962
01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:14,550
No, we gotta do something really big.

963
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:16,631
- Like what?
- Something they won't laugh at.

964
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:18,074
Tell me.

965
01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:20,276
We should take down the Flyer.

966
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:23,279
- Take down the Flyer?
- That's right.

967
01:12:23,960 --> 01:12:25,757
That's the stupidest idea
I've ever heard.

968
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:27,797
That's what you said
about the truck.

969
01:12:28,040 --> 01:12:30,156
The armoured truck was dumb.
This is stupid.

970
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:31,913
There ain't nothing to steal.

971
01:12:32,160 --> 01:12:35,072
- Steal the train and ride to Mexico.
- What for?

972
01:12:35,320 --> 01:12:38,198
To prove we can do it.
It's the only time we failed.

973
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:41,040
No, we're not gonna do it. So forget it.

974
01:12:41,320 --> 01:12:45,154
I'm sick of you telling me
what I can do and what I can't.

975
01:12:45,400 --> 01:12:49,154
Archie, the Gold Coast Flyer
ain't no armoured truck.

976
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:52,079
It's a 70-ton train
going 100 miles an hour.

977
01:12:52,360 --> 01:12:53,918
That didn't stop us last time.

978
01:12:54,200 --> 01:12:56,111
Last time we were 30 years younger.

979
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:59,358
We're 30 years smarter.
We won't make the same mistakes.

980
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:02,478
That's right
because we ain't gonna do it.

981
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:19,151
<i>And one, and two, and three,</i>
<i>and four.</i>

982
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:23,718
- <i>Now stretch, and two, and three...</i>
- Shut up.

983
01:13:24,520 --> 01:13:27,671
How the hell anyone can live
in a rat hole like this,

984
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:31,708
- I'd kill myself in an hour.
- You've been here 45 minutes.

985
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:39,194
- You didn't have to hit him.
- That's right. I should have shot him.

986
01:13:39,440 --> 01:13:41,476
Get him up. We're getting out.

987
01:13:41,720 --> 01:13:42,675
Move!

988
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:47,197
- Where are we going?
- Disneyland. Out. Out.

989
01:13:56,240 --> 01:13:58,310
- Howard, call the police.
- What's going on?

990
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:01,518
There's a maniac upstairs with a gun.
Call the police!

991
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:04,433
- I'm a cop. Where is he?
- He's upstairs, officer.

992
01:14:04,680 --> 01:14:07,672
He's in Room 210. He's right up there.

993
01:14:10,160 --> 01:14:14,199
- I think you're scared, Harry.
- Damn right I'm scared.

994
01:14:14,440 --> 01:14:17,432
If you had brains, which you don't,
you'd be scared, too.

995
01:14:17,680 --> 01:14:21,753
I never thought I'd see the great
Harry Doyle turn into a gutless wimp.

996
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:25,879
Keep it up, Arch. I'll put
another hole in that chin of yours.

997
01:14:26,120 --> 01:14:29,317
Before or after you take your nap,
grandpa?

998
01:14:29,720 --> 01:14:32,359
All right, Archie, that does it.
Now put them up.

999
01:14:32,600 --> 01:14:35,433
Now hold it. Wait a minute, Harry.

1000
01:14:35,720 --> 01:14:37,438
- Walk over there.
- Put them up.

1001
01:14:37,680 --> 01:14:38,954
- Harry!
- Harry!

1002
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:42,993
Damn!

1003
01:14:45,960 --> 01:14:46,870
That hurt!

1004
01:14:49,280 --> 01:14:52,272
You're not supposed to hit a man
with glasses, goddamn it.

1005
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:54,551
- You guys OK?
- Yeah.

1006
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:56,631
The cops. Let's go.

1007
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:01,030
- Call the police!
- I did.

1008
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,753
- Call the police!
- Goddamn it, lady.

1009
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:09,877
I am the police!

1010
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:13,751
That's my goddamn car.

1011
01:15:22,200 --> 01:15:23,838
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

1012
01:15:24,080 --> 01:15:26,196
There's a lunatic loose in there.

1013
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:30,356
Assholes.

1014
01:15:41,240 --> 01:15:45,199
- Who was that guy?
- I don't know, but he don't like us.

1015
01:15:46,120 --> 01:15:49,476
- I tried to stop him, but he had a gun.
- You did fine.

1016
01:15:49,720 --> 01:15:52,280
You're a stand-up guy.
We're proud of you.

1017
01:15:53,080 --> 01:15:57,392
- We make a pretty good team.
- We make a great team, Richie.

1018
01:15:57,640 --> 01:16:00,996
It's nice to have someone around
who's got guts.

1019
01:16:02,720 --> 01:16:05,632
- Where'd you guys get this car?
- We swiped it.

1020
01:16:08,080 --> 01:16:09,718
- You swiped it?
- Yeah.

1021
01:16:10,240 --> 01:16:14,074
- As in stole it?
- That's our job. We steal things.

1022
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:16,356
Don't we, Harry?

1023
01:16:25,360 --> 01:16:28,909
I can't believe you guys
stole an armoured truck.

1024
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:33,278
It was empty,
if that makes you feel better.

1025
01:16:34,560 --> 01:16:36,278
It's all my fault.

1026
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:40,512
This would have never happened
if I'd been a better officer.

1027
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:44,588
It's not your fault, Richie.
You're the best PO we ever had.

1028
01:16:46,160 --> 01:16:47,798
I failed.

1029
01:16:48,040 --> 01:16:50,793
See what you're doing
if you steal that train?

1030
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:52,951
Don't you think you've
caused enough trouble?

1031
01:16:53,200 --> 01:16:55,919
What are you talking about?
Steal what train?

1032
01:16:56,160 --> 01:16:59,789
The Gold Coast Flyer, kid.
Just like the old days.

1033
01:17:00,600 --> 01:17:02,431
You can't be serious.

1034
01:17:02,680 --> 01:17:05,877
And he's going to get caught
just like the old days.

1035
01:17:06,160 --> 01:17:10,676
- You're gonna rob a train by yourself?
- No, no. Not by myself.

1036
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:13,671
I'm getting a new partner.

1037
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:16,996
- You.
- Me?

1038
01:17:17,240 --> 01:17:21,199
Sure. A cinch for a couple
of young guys like us.

1039
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:22,589
Think of it.

1040
01:17:22,840 --> 01:17:28,358
Archie Long and Richie Evans
on the cover of "People Magazine".

1041
01:17:28,600 --> 01:17:31,558
We'd be a goddamn
movie of the week.

1042
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:34,553
- Does he mean it?
- He means it.

1043
01:17:35,200 --> 01:17:37,430
Damn right I mean it.

1044
01:17:37,680 --> 01:17:39,875
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

1045
01:17:42,040 --> 01:17:44,156
I couldn't do that.

1046
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:46,595
I'm a criminologist. I'm not a criminal.

1047
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:50,998
See, no one wants to have anything
to do with your moronic schemes.

1048
01:17:51,240 --> 01:17:52,753
Moronic.

1049
01:17:53,320 --> 01:17:57,279
That did it, Harry. I've taken your shit
for 40 years. I've had it.

1050
01:17:58,160 --> 01:17:59,832
Fine with me.

1051
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:02,719
I was getting tired
of carrying you anyway.

1052
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:04,313
Carrying me?

1053
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:08,633
If it wasn't for me, you'd still be sitting
around planning to rob something,

1054
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:12,156
sometime, maybe if it wasn't
too dangerous.

1055
01:18:13,960 --> 01:18:17,839
Go ahead, tough guy.
See how far you get without me.

1056
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:20,550
You bet I will.

1057
01:18:22,280 --> 01:18:25,716
- And I ain't going to your funeral.
- You ain't invited.

1058
01:18:35,240 --> 01:18:37,800
He's not really
gonna go through with it.

1059
01:18:39,360 --> 01:18:41,032
Will he?

1060
01:19:02,920 --> 01:19:05,275
Once a thief, always a thief.

1061
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:20,949
Broad daylight.

1062
01:19:21,240 --> 01:19:24,232
The engineer can see for 200 yards.

1063
01:19:24,520 --> 01:19:26,431
He's gotta stop.

1064
01:19:30,920 --> 01:19:33,639
He's gotta be blind not to see this car.

1065
01:19:43,880 --> 01:19:46,189
Maybe I should have brought the truck.

1066
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:06,951
Piece of cake.

1067
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:19,433
What's the trouble, officer?

1068
01:20:19,680 --> 01:20:21,398
Your train's being robbed.

1069
01:20:21,680 --> 01:20:25,116
You're crazy.
Nobody robs trains any more.

1070
01:20:26,160 --> 01:20:28,230
I'd say you've been misinformed.

1071
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:30,791
What took you so long?

1072
01:20:31,040 --> 01:20:34,476
We gonna waste time gabbing
or are we gonna rob a train?

1073
01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:37,669
Anything you say, Harry.

1074
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:47,400
I'm sure we'll be underway
momentarily.

1075
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:50,831
Go forward and ask the engineer
why we've stopped.

1076
01:20:53,840 --> 01:20:55,990
Looks like I don't have to.

1077
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:01,758
Afternoon, gentlemen. Ladies.

1078
01:21:02,520 --> 01:21:05,557
- My name is Harry Doyle.
- I'm Archie Long.

1079
01:21:05,840 --> 01:21:08,673
- What do you want?
- We're taking this train.

1080
01:21:12,040 --> 01:21:14,474
Now, you reporters
get them names straight.

1081
01:21:14,760 --> 01:21:16,751
Doyle, Long.

1082
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:21,630
He's 72. I'm 67
and these ain't disguises.

1083
01:21:22,720 --> 01:21:25,871
Could you please take pictures?
We ain't modest. Right, Harry?

1084
01:21:26,120 --> 01:21:27,075
Right, Arch.

1085
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:34,913
This is nuts. It's 1986.
Nobody robs trains any more.

1086
01:21:35,160 --> 01:21:36,912
Well, somebody did.

1087
01:21:37,960 --> 01:21:39,393
And I know who.

1088
01:21:39,640 --> 01:21:42,074
Oh, really, Yablonski.
And who might that be?

1089
01:21:42,360 --> 01:21:45,716
Same guys that robbed it
30 years ago, sir.

1090
01:21:52,760 --> 01:21:55,069
And they'll get
another 30 years this time.

1091
01:21:55,320 --> 01:21:58,312
- What?
- It just came over the radio.

1092
01:21:58,560 --> 01:22:02,872
Your two heroes have
just hijacked another train.

1093
01:22:05,160 --> 01:22:06,593
Oh, no.

1094
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:10,190
First sign of trouble I said
send them back to the pen.

1095
01:22:11,440 --> 01:22:14,512
They're good guys.
They just got off to a bad start.

1096
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:16,199
Come on, Evans.

1097
01:22:16,520 --> 01:22:19,910
They came out of prison,
and all we did was give them rules.

1098
01:22:20,200 --> 01:22:21,315
That's the system.

1099
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:23,795
No, no. We treated them like children.

1100
01:22:24,040 --> 01:22:27,157
We told them where to live,
who to see, how to behave.

1101
01:22:27,440 --> 01:22:30,034
That's how the system works.

1102
01:22:31,360 --> 01:22:33,191
Well, then, the system sucks.

1103
01:22:40,440 --> 01:22:43,273
Gentlemen, can you tell us
why you're robbing this train?

1104
01:22:43,520 --> 01:22:46,876
- It isn't carrying anything of any value.
- You're wrong, son.

1105
01:22:47,120 --> 01:22:49,429
- It's carrying memories.
- Yeah.

1106
01:22:49,680 --> 01:22:51,955
That's why we're taking
the whole damn thing.

1107
01:22:52,240 --> 01:22:56,074
Nobody's taking nothing nowhere.
Excuse me.

1108
01:22:56,480 --> 01:22:57,879
Excuse me.

1109
01:22:59,960 --> 01:23:01,598
Lose the iron, shitheads.

1110
01:23:03,800 --> 01:23:06,678
Lose it! Come on. Come on.

1111
01:23:08,920 --> 01:23:10,512
You're gonna get a reward.

1112
01:23:10,760 --> 01:23:13,069
Zip the lip, dog breath.

1113
01:23:13,360 --> 01:23:16,238
- Who the hell are you anyway?
- I'm Peter Pan.

1114
01:23:16,480 --> 01:23:19,040
I've come to take you
to Never Neverland, OK?

1115
01:23:19,280 --> 01:23:23,273
- But you won't be coming back.
- Why do you wanna kill us?

1116
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:25,750
- I'm Leon B Little.
- So?

1117
01:23:26,040 --> 01:23:29,510
Leon B Little!
Don't the name mean nothing to you?

1118
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:30,670
No.

1119
01:23:30,920 --> 01:23:33,036
Do you at least know
Vinnie Mintelman?

1120
01:23:33,320 --> 01:23:36,198
- Yeah.
- Thank God they know somebody.

1121
01:23:36,440 --> 01:23:39,637
Vinnie gave me 25 big ones
to snuff you guys.

1122
01:23:39,920 --> 01:23:43,674
- Vinnie's been dead since 1956.
- Yeah?

1123
01:23:43,960 --> 01:23:45,871
And we've been in prison since 1956.

1124
01:23:46,160 --> 01:23:50,438
So I've been waiting since 1956
for you two guys to get out, OK?

1125
01:23:50,720 --> 01:23:51,869
30 years?

1126
01:23:52,640 --> 01:23:55,712
When Leon B Little takes a job,
he sees it through.

1127
01:23:55,960 --> 01:23:58,918
That's my reputation.
I'm very proud of it.

1128
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:38,471
There's a whole
goddamn army out there.

1129
01:24:39,320 --> 01:24:41,470
All right, everybody face the windows.
Move!

1130
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:45,594
What the hell you waiting for?
An engraved invitation? Move!

1131
01:24:46,160 --> 01:24:49,755
- Let's see them shoot through that.
- There ain't gonna be no killing.

1132
01:24:50,040 --> 01:24:52,600
Harry Doyle and Archie Long
never killed nobody.

1133
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:56,315
- You reporters take note of that.
- Well, I did, 26 guys.

1134
01:24:56,560 --> 01:24:57,879
Take note of that.

1135
01:24:58,120 --> 01:25:01,874
Killing them ain't gonna do us
any good. There's cops out there.

1136
01:25:02,520 --> 01:25:05,159
Why don't we make a truce.
Start working together.

1137
01:25:05,400 --> 01:25:07,197
Yeah, you can kill us later.

1138
01:25:09,440 --> 01:25:13,718
OK. But when this is over,
you guys are dead meat.

1139
01:25:13,960 --> 01:25:15,678
- You got a deal.
- Right.

1140
01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:20,429
<i>Harry Doyle and Archie Long.</i>
<i>This is Yablonski.</i>

1141
01:25:20,720 --> 01:25:25,111
- <i>Hold your fire, I'm coming aboard.</i>
- Kiss my ass, Yablonski!

1142
01:25:25,360 --> 01:25:27,794
- Who's Yablonski?
- How'd that bum get here?

1143
01:25:28,040 --> 01:25:30,395
- He's got a good memory.
- Who's Yablonski?

1144
01:25:30,640 --> 01:25:34,633
- Should we let him aboard?
- Why not? See what he has to say.

1145
01:25:36,040 --> 01:25:37,268
Who's Yablonski?

1146
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:50,677
Just keep looking out those windows.

1147
01:25:50,920 --> 01:25:54,071
That's it. That's it. Damn it.

1148
01:25:57,800 --> 01:25:59,028
He's clean.

1149
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:03,432
It's gonna be a habit with us.
You rob a train and I arrest you.

1150
01:26:03,680 --> 01:26:05,671
You ain't arrested us yet, Deke.

1151
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:07,990
There's 50 cops out there.

1152
01:26:08,240 --> 01:26:11,357
- Is that all you brought?
- You can't get away.

1153
01:26:11,640 --> 01:26:13,870
You try and they'll cut you to pieces.

1154
01:26:14,120 --> 01:26:17,590
I sure as hell
don't feel like going back to jail.

1155
01:26:17,840 --> 01:26:20,559
Surrender's for wimps. I vote we die.

1156
01:26:21,120 --> 01:26:22,394
This guy's nuts.

1157
01:26:22,680 --> 01:26:24,318
Did I hear a whisper?

1158
01:26:24,600 --> 01:26:28,036
Sorry, Deke. This time
you don't take us without a fight.

1159
01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:31,872
- You know what that means?
- We know exactly what that means.

1160
01:26:34,120 --> 01:26:36,270
You can take these people
off the train.

1161
01:26:36,520 --> 01:26:40,513
We don't want your cops killing
innocent bystanders by mistake.

1162
01:26:44,920 --> 01:26:50,040
Hold your fire. The passengers
are coming out. Hold your fire.

1163
01:26:50,840 --> 01:26:52,273
Step lively, damn it.

1164
01:26:53,720 --> 01:26:54,835
Come on. Move. Move.

1165
01:26:59,200 --> 01:27:01,236
I'm gonna get a hundred
of those coppers.

1166
01:27:01,520 --> 01:27:03,556
There's only 50, Leon.

1167
01:27:03,800 --> 01:27:06,837
So I'll shoot them all twice.

1168
01:27:10,680 --> 01:27:14,070
I'm giving you one chance.
Come out now and nobody gets hurt.

1169
01:27:19,920 --> 01:27:22,593
Wait a minute, where are you going?

1170
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:25,678
Who the hell is driving this train?

1171
01:27:30,400 --> 01:27:31,799
Not my car.

1172
01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:34,119
Come on, you guys.

1173
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:38,313
No.

1174
01:27:54,640 --> 01:27:56,437
Top of the world, Ma!

1175
01:27:59,160 --> 01:28:01,720
- Arch.
- I wanna throw a little scare into them.

1176
01:28:13,320 --> 01:28:14,958
Come on!

1177
01:28:15,960 --> 01:28:17,871
Where were you 30 years ago?

1178
01:28:20,120 --> 01:28:22,236
- Hold the fort, Leon.
- What fort?

1179
01:28:26,320 --> 01:28:28,788
- What's that?
- Souvenir.

1180
01:28:35,880 --> 01:28:39,031
Damn, they think
they're happy cowboys?

1181
01:28:39,520 --> 01:28:42,193
What is this, the gunfight
at the OK Corral?

1182
01:29:05,080 --> 01:29:07,435
Hold it. Hold it.

1183
01:29:08,280 --> 01:29:10,032
- Take me up.
- There isn't room.

1184
01:29:10,280 --> 01:29:12,191
There is now.

1185
01:29:27,440 --> 01:29:30,000
Richie, what are you doing here?

1186
01:29:30,200 --> 01:29:32,919
- I'm part of the team, aren't I?
- You sure are.

1187
01:29:33,200 --> 01:29:37,079
I'm proud of you. Look at this.
The Gold Coast Flyer in gold.

1188
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:40,149
Look out!

1189
01:29:40,400 --> 01:29:41,515
Take it easy.

1190
01:29:41,760 --> 01:29:45,355
- I got him, I got him.
- It's OK. He's one of us now.

1191
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:47,397
Temporarily, temporarily.

1192
01:29:47,640 --> 01:29:51,235
Give me back my gun
or I'll jam it up your ass.

1193
01:29:51,520 --> 01:29:54,796
We have an update on
the final run of the Gold Coast Flyer.

1194
01:29:55,040 --> 01:29:59,192
<i>The train was stopped, boarded</i>
<i>and then hijacked by two armed men.</i>

1195
01:29:59,480 --> 01:30:03,678
<i>The bandits identified themselves</i>
<i>as Archie Long and Harry Doyle...</i>

1196
01:30:05,200 --> 01:30:08,033
<i>... the same men who robbed</i>
<i>this train 30 years ago.</i>

1197
01:30:08,280 --> 01:30:09,315
Give them hell, Harry.

1198
01:30:27,080 --> 01:30:30,390
- How do I talk to these bums?
- Put your headset on.

1199
01:30:34,160 --> 01:30:35,991
Try at 44-49.

1200
01:30:36,240 --> 01:30:39,835
Doyle, Long, this is Yablonski.
You read me?

1201
01:30:40,120 --> 01:30:41,109
We hear you, Deke.

1202
01:30:41,400 --> 01:30:44,790
This is stupid. You can't get away.
You got no place to run.

1203
01:30:45,080 --> 01:30:46,433
We're running to Mexico.

1204
01:30:49,480 --> 01:30:52,790
Tell him to open the switches
or we'll wreck the goddamn train.

1205
01:30:53,040 --> 01:30:55,998
Open the switches
or we'll wreck the goddamn train.

1206
01:30:56,280 --> 01:30:59,192
Let's wreck the goddamn train anyway.

1207
01:30:59,480 --> 01:31:03,075
For chrissakes,
the track don't go to Mexico.

1208
01:31:03,360 --> 01:31:06,670
Guys, he's right.
They end right here.

1209
01:31:26,400 --> 01:31:30,678
Super, you go up there in the tower.
James, you come over here with me.

1210
01:31:36,160 --> 01:31:38,993
We didn't come this far
to be stopped by a technicality.

1211
01:31:39,240 --> 01:31:41,435
That's right, Harry.
Nothing can stop us.

1212
01:31:42,840 --> 01:31:45,434
We have to get rid of some weight.

1213
01:31:49,760 --> 01:31:53,514
You'll never cross alive!

1214
01:31:55,320 --> 01:31:59,233
Did you see that guy there?
Arrest him. Arrest him.

1215
01:32:02,600 --> 01:32:04,238
It ain't over, you bastards!

1216
01:32:04,520 --> 01:32:09,389
I'm gonna get you two guys
even if it takes another 30 years!

1217
01:32:11,360 --> 01:32:13,316
I don't think that helped a lot.

1218
01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:15,670
But it sure was fun doing it.

1219
01:32:15,920 --> 01:32:18,992
Take Richie back and uncouple
the rest of the cars.

1220
01:32:19,240 --> 01:32:21,071
We don't need no extra baggage.

1221
01:32:22,520 --> 01:32:24,272
Come on, Richie.

1222
01:32:35,680 --> 01:32:37,193
- Jump.
- Jump?

1223
01:32:37,440 --> 01:32:39,112
Jump.

1224
01:32:40,240 --> 01:32:43,391
- What do you want me to do now?
- Just watch me.

1225
01:32:46,120 --> 01:32:47,109
Give me a hand.

1226
01:32:47,400 --> 01:32:52,110
Remember, you're a criminologist.
Not a criminal.

1227
01:32:52,360 --> 01:32:55,079
If they give you trouble,
tell them we kidnapped you.

1228
01:32:59,880 --> 01:33:02,075
So long, tough guy!

1229
01:33:05,200 --> 01:33:08,670
There's one guy left behind.
Who's that guy in a SWAT uniform?

1230
01:33:15,360 --> 01:33:17,510
Hey, fatso.

1231
01:33:21,200 --> 01:33:22,315
What the...?

1232
01:33:35,240 --> 01:33:37,834
Nobody fire until I give the command.

1233
01:33:38,360 --> 01:33:40,510
Looks like we got
a welcoming committee.

1234
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:45,150
Let's get ready to greet them.

1235
01:33:46,160 --> 01:33:47,718
Hang on.

1236
01:33:52,880 --> 01:33:54,836
What are they doing?

1237
01:33:58,040 --> 01:34:02,431
- They're gonna go for it.
- On my command, commence firing.

1238
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:07,513
They're gonna go for it.

1239
01:34:09,760 --> 01:34:15,835
<i>We've been working on the railroad</i>
<i>All the livelong day</i>

1240
01:34:16,480 --> 01:34:22,191
<i>We've been working on the railroad</i>
<i>Just to pass the time away</i>

1241
01:34:23,240 --> 01:34:25,800
- Go for it, guys!
- Fire.

1242
01:34:32,040 --> 01:34:35,271
Holy shit. They're not stopping.
Get out!

1243
01:35:01,200 --> 01:35:05,910
Son of a bitch! They made it!
Did you see that? Did you see that?

1244
01:35:09,480 --> 01:35:11,755
OK, kid, take me home.

1245
01:35:40,080 --> 01:35:41,991
What a ride.

1246
01:35:43,040 --> 01:35:44,792
I'm afraid we wrecked their train.

1247
01:35:45,560 --> 01:35:47,516
They weren't gonna use it any more,
anyway.

1248
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:55,513
Here we go again.

1249
01:36:04,240 --> 01:36:05,992
Put up your hands.

1250
01:36:06,240 --> 01:36:08,037
I'm afraid you're under arrest.

1251
01:36:11,200 --> 01:36:12,758
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

1252
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,594
- This ain't fair.
- No?

1253
01:36:16,160 --> 01:36:20,517
- There's 12 of you and just two of us.
- <i>Si.</i>

1254
01:36:20,800 --> 01:36:23,917
And you got guns, and we got nothing.

1255
01:36:24,200 --> 01:36:27,033
But this is how we put you
under arrest, <i>senor.</i>

1256
01:36:27,280 --> 01:36:31,637
Where we come from,
they got rules about making arrests.

1257
01:36:32,520 --> 01:36:34,954
- Rules?
- <i>Si.</i>

1258
01:36:35,200 --> 01:36:37,509
What kind of rules?

1259
01:36:39,200 --> 01:36:41,475
Well, for one thing.
