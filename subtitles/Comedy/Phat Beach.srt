Oooh-whoo!

Woman:

00:00:48,648 --> 00:00:51,088
<i>There you go, baby.</i>

6
00:00:51,086 --> 00:00:53,086
Mmm!

7
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:55,600
- Go for it, Benny.
- Yeah, Benny!
Go get it!

8
00:00:55,595 --> 00:00:57,595
Go for it!

9
00:00:57,599 --> 00:01:02,069
- You mind if I join you?
- If you think you can keep up.

10
00:01:02,074 --> 00:01:04,714
<i>C'est votre monde.</i>

11
00:01:04,713 --> 00:01:08,393

- Yeah, go ahead!
Go ahead!

00:01:12,629 --> 00:01:14,629

Go, Benny, go!

16
00:01:31,567 --> 00:01:33,967
I've got something
for you.

17
00:01:33,972 --> 00:01:35,942
Don't hold it back
now.

18
00:01:40,986 --> 00:01:43,756
Girl:
<i>Benny! Benny!</i>

19
00:01:43,758 --> 00:01:46,228
- <i>Benny! Benny!</i>
- What?

20
00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:48,799
Get out of that
damn shower already!

21
00:01:48,801 --> 00:01:50,711
Damn it, Tasha!
Get out!

22
00:01:50,705 --> 00:01:52,305
<i>Mama said</i>
<i>you gotta get out.</i>

23
00:01:52,308 --> 00:01:54,648
Tasha, I'll be right out.
All right? I'll be right out.

24
00:01:54,647 --> 00:01:57,717
- Mama said now!
- Tasha, leave me alone!

25
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:01,189
Mama said she don't know what
you could be doing in here
for an hour and a half!

26
00:02:01,192 --> 00:02:03,162
Kiss my ass, all right?
Now go tell her that!

27
00:02:03,163 --> 00:02:07,273
Mama, Benny just told me
to kiss his big black butt!

28
00:02:07,271 --> 00:02:09,041
What's going on
in here?

29
00:02:10,044 --> 00:02:13,424
Ma, I am trying
to take a shower!

30
00:02:13,418 --> 00:02:15,718
I told you not to
pick on your sister.

31
00:02:15,722 --> 00:02:18,132
Okay, mom,
I'm very sorry.

32
00:02:18,126 --> 00:02:20,156
Benny, come downstairs
and help me wash the car.

33
00:02:20,164 --> 00:02:22,334
All right,
I'll be right out, dad.
One second.

34
00:02:22,334 --> 00:02:24,174
Don't take that tone
with me, boy!

35
00:02:24,172 --> 00:02:26,012
You've been up here
an hour and a half.

36
00:02:26,009 --> 00:02:27,609
You think water
grows on trees?

37
00:02:27,612 --> 00:02:29,782
Don't take that long
to wash your big, wide ass.

38
00:02:29,783 --> 00:02:31,693
What is there,
a drought around here
or something?

39
00:02:31,687 --> 00:02:33,617
I heard that.

40
00:02:33,624 --> 00:02:38,174
There's gonna be
a drought on food,
you keep talkin' back.

41
00:02:40,438 --> 00:02:42,368
( Chuckles )

42
00:02:45,314 --> 00:02:48,724
- So I see you're not
stickin' to your diet, huh?
- This is low-fat.

43
00:02:48,721 --> 00:02:50,891
Put it down.

44
00:02:50,892 --> 00:02:52,902
Get that off of there!

45
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,740
So, first day
on the new job, huh?

46
00:02:57,739 --> 00:02:59,709
- Excited?
- no, dad, i--

47
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:02,780
you know, I remember
my first job back in
college-- milking cows.

48
00:03:02,783 --> 00:03:05,893
Not very glamorous,
but taught me to
respect the dollar.

49
00:03:05,889 --> 00:03:07,959
I thought this summer
I'd just take
a poetry class.

50
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:11,129
No, you're gonna have
plenty of time for poetry
back in school next fall.

51
00:03:11,132 --> 00:03:15,212
- This summer it's work.
Physical, manual work.
- But, dad--

52
00:03:15,207 --> 00:03:17,507
nothing like physical work,
especially for a boy
in your shape.

53
00:03:17,512 --> 00:03:19,422
Get you moving a little bit.

54
00:03:19,415 --> 00:03:21,715
But, dad, only 10 people
got accepted to this class.

55
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:25,230
Benjamin, writin'
didn't buy this car.
Hard work did.

56
00:03:25,227 --> 00:03:29,867
Every time I sit behind
the wheel, I feel like
i can conquer the world.

57
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:31,910
I want you to know
that feeling, son.

58
00:03:31,907 --> 00:03:33,377
- Yeah?
- yeah.

59
00:03:33,376 --> 00:03:35,446
So I could drive
the car now?

60
00:03:35,448 --> 00:03:37,818
Get that
"conquering the world"
feeling going.

61
00:03:37,819 --> 00:03:40,219
I can even drive it to work,
'cause my bike is broke.

62
00:03:40,224 --> 00:03:43,234
You ain't gonna conquer
nothin' in my car.
Take your sister's bike.

63
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:45,540
- But, dad,
that's a girl's bike!
- Who'll know?

64
00:03:45,535 --> 00:03:48,905
- Jesus, durrel!
Turn that shit down!
- Sorry, Mr. king.

65
00:03:48,908 --> 00:03:52,108
Hey, what's up, Benny?

66
00:03:52,114 --> 00:03:56,294
- So, what are your plans
for the summer, durrel?
- Oh, you know me.

67
00:03:56,289 --> 00:03:59,259
Hang out.
Listen to some tunes.

68
00:03:59,262 --> 00:04:00,572
Sleep.

69
00:04:00,565 --> 00:04:02,325
Terrific.

70
00:04:02,334 --> 00:04:04,844
Hey.
come up here, baby.

71
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:08,410
- Me and Trisha
was thinkin' about--
- Theresa! It's Theresa!

72
00:04:08,413 --> 00:04:10,423
Baby, I know
it's Theresa.

73
00:04:10,418 --> 00:04:14,228
Trisha's just like
my little pet name
for you, that's all.

74
00:04:14,225 --> 00:04:17,465
Anyway, Benny, me
and tr-- uh, Theresa--

75
00:04:17,465 --> 00:04:19,295
was thinkin' about
going to that carnival.

76
00:04:19,302 --> 00:04:21,612
- You want in?
- No, man, I gotta
go to work.

77
00:04:21,607 --> 00:04:24,107
Work? what about
that poetry nonsense?

78
00:04:24,111 --> 00:04:27,281
- Oh, my father didn't
think it was a good idea.
- You pussy!

79
00:04:27,284 --> 00:04:31,294
- Come on, durrel!
- You never stick up
for what you want.

80
00:04:31,292 --> 00:04:35,402
- Oh, man.
- All right then, man.
We outta here.

81
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,370
( Engine starts )

82
00:04:37,371 --> 00:04:39,981
Bye-bye, fat boy!

83
00:04:39,977 --> 00:04:42,107
Fuck you, durrel.

84
00:04:42,114 --> 00:04:44,854
He's teaching me
about responsibility,

85
00:04:44,853 --> 00:04:47,463
getting me prepared
for my future!

86
00:04:47,459 --> 00:04:49,359
Welcome to
the house of burgers,

87
00:04:49,362 --> 00:04:51,372
where the burger's
the king.

88
00:04:51,366 --> 00:04:53,366
Can I take
your order, please?

89
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:56,340
<i>I'll have a burg-- ap--</i>
<i>and a-- lar--</i>

90
00:04:56,342 --> 00:04:58,352
I'm sorry,
i-i couldn't hear you.

91
00:04:58,346 --> 00:05:00,346
Would you mind
repeating that?

92
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:03,460
<i>I said I'll have a large--</i>
<i>ur-- ah-- meno--</i>

93
00:05:03,457 --> 00:05:05,857
- what?
- come on, man!

94
00:05:05,862 --> 00:05:07,202
Get your shit together!

95
00:05:07,197 --> 00:05:08,927
"Get my shit together"?

96
00:05:08,934 --> 00:05:11,974
Benny, remember,
the customer is
always correct.

97
00:05:13,644 --> 00:05:15,854
Do you mind
repeating that?

98
00:05:15,848 --> 00:05:18,548
- I can't really hear
you that clearly.
- Okay, man.

99
00:05:18,554 --> 00:05:22,964
I said I'll have a burg--
ap-- and a-- lar--

100
00:05:22,962 --> 00:05:26,002
- what?
- what seems to be
the problem, man?

101
00:05:26,002 --> 00:05:28,712
The problem is
you don't know how
to fucking speak!

102
00:05:28,707 --> 00:05:32,547
Look, jerk-off, just get me
a burg-- app-- and a larg--

103
00:05:32,549 --> 00:05:34,989
or I'm gonna come
in there and kick your ass!

104
00:05:34,986 --> 00:05:38,526
- Oh, yeah?
- <i>Actually, I'm gonna</i>
<i>blow your head off.</i>

105
00:05:38,527 --> 00:05:40,127
Somebody pass me
them bullets.

106
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:42,230
I'm gonna kill
this fool.

107
00:05:42,234 --> 00:05:43,874
I need a quick break.

108
00:05:50,418 --> 00:05:52,418
Durrel!

109
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:55,961
What, you tryin' to
get me fired?

110
00:05:55,962 --> 00:05:59,472
No, man, just tryin'
to add a little excitement
to your miserable summer.

111
00:05:59,469 --> 00:06:02,409
- This here's Dana. Right?
- Yes, it is.

112
00:06:02,407 --> 00:06:06,317
Dana, this is my boy Benny.
Uh, cool outfit, man.

113
00:06:06,315 --> 00:06:08,315
Fuck you, durrel!

114
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:10,319
Gimme a minute,
would you, baby?

115
00:06:10,323 --> 00:06:12,363
Gimme a minute.
Gimme a minute.
Gimme a minute.

116
00:06:13,864 --> 00:06:15,874
What happened
to Theresa?

117
00:06:15,868 --> 00:06:18,868
Oh, man. Lost and found
at the carnival.

118
00:06:18,874 --> 00:06:21,014
Lost her, found Dana.

119
00:06:21,012 --> 00:06:23,452
Maybe you could score
us a burger and fries
or something.

120
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:27,020
- Durrel, I only been
working here for an hour!
- Chill, man. I hear you.

121
00:06:27,024 --> 00:06:30,234
- That ain't why
I'm here anyway.
- Why are you here then?

122
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:32,470
Two words, baby:

123
00:06:32,468 --> 00:06:34,638
The fuckin' beach.

124
00:06:35,808 --> 00:06:38,808
Quit your job.
Let's mob to the beach
today!

125
00:06:38,814 --> 00:06:40,554
Are you stupid?

126
00:06:40,551 --> 00:06:43,591
You know damn well
i can't go nowhere.
My father got me this job.

127
00:06:43,591 --> 00:06:46,361
Lookee here. Lookee here.
Tell me what you see.

128
00:06:47,632 --> 00:06:49,642
So what?
A box of sunglasses.

129
00:06:49,636 --> 00:06:52,266
- I got 'em for 10¢ apiece!
- Fuck you, durrel.

130
00:06:52,274 --> 00:06:54,254
- What do you mean, fuck me?
- I know what you're thinking.

131
00:06:54,245 --> 00:06:56,615
I'm not getting caught
up in no more of your
stupid-ass schemes.

132
00:06:56,617 --> 00:06:59,687
We sell 'em
for five bucks apiece,
we make about five grand.

133
00:06:59,689 --> 00:07:02,059
- You can take that class.
- No, man.

134
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:03,630
I'm not with it, man.

135
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:07,301
- Plus the beach bitches.
- "Beach bitches"?

136
00:07:07,304 --> 00:07:10,014
Beach bitches!
The hottest in
the world, man.

137
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:11,980
We go down there
and we just fuck 'em all,

138
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:14,990
'cause in l. A. That's all
they wanna do is fuck.

139
00:07:14,986 --> 00:07:18,056
Their parents encourage
that type of behavior.

140
00:07:18,059 --> 00:07:21,499
For real?
I don't know, man.

141
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:24,440
I gotta work here
during the day
and write at night.

142
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:26,609
- Van gogh, man,
you a virgin.
- Shh!

143
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:28,980
What the hell you doin'?
You tellin' the whole city.

144
00:07:28,981 --> 00:07:32,591
How you gonna be
a great writer like Van gogh
if you don't fuck somebody?

145
00:07:32,588 --> 00:07:35,288
See how stupid you are?
Van gogh was a painter.

146
00:07:35,293 --> 00:07:37,473
You think Van gogh
don't get laid?

147
00:07:37,465 --> 00:07:40,805
Benny! we got
mouths to feed, huh?

148
00:07:40,805 --> 00:07:42,775
And tell your little
ugly friend

149
00:07:42,775 --> 00:07:44,475
if he ain't buyin' nothin',
he's gotta leave.

150
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:46,479
All right.
I'm comin' in.

152
00:07:48,554 --> 00:07:51,534
- No, sir. No, sir.
- See what I'm sayin'?

153
00:07:51,526 --> 00:07:53,726
You gonna be like that
the rest of your life?

154
00:07:53,731 --> 00:07:58,111
We leave at 1:00,
we on the beach makin' money
by 3:00, guaranteed.

155
00:07:58,106 --> 00:08:01,106
Your parents are goin' out
of town anyway, man.

156
00:08:01,112 --> 00:08:04,692
Here. take these
sunglasses, man.

157
00:08:04,686 --> 00:08:08,356
As soon as you put them on,
women will begin
flockin' to you.

Manager:

People gonna think
you on drugs or somethin'.

161
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:19,350
I think they're hot.
Leave 'em on.

162

- <i>They're sexy.</i>

163
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:25,360
- Leave 'em on.
- The customer's always right.

164
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,170
Why don't we go
somewhere romantic?

165
00:08:29,168 --> 00:08:32,038
Why don't you just give me
a big kiss?

166
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:34,910
Aaah! what the hell
are you doin'?

167
00:08:34,913 --> 00:08:37,223
- Benny, what's goin' on?
- I'm trying to order something

168
00:08:37,217 --> 00:08:39,247
when he jumps the counter like
he's tryin' to attack me!

169
00:08:39,254 --> 00:08:42,064
I thought there was
a-a-a bee or somethin'
on her shoulder.

170
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:45,430
He was gonna attack me
with that look of lust
in his eyes.

171
00:08:45,434 --> 00:08:47,574
<i>Don't look at me like that,</i>

172
00:08:47,572 --> 00:08:50,712

<i>Benny, what's wrong?</i>
<i>You seem to be distracted.</i>

173
00:08:50,711 --> 00:08:52,581
I'm talking to you,
Benjamin!

174
00:08:52,582 --> 00:08:54,852
Don't call me Benjamin.

175
00:08:56,957 --> 00:09:00,757
Benny, if you walk
out that door,

176
00:09:00,764 --> 00:09:04,814
I'm afraid you will
not have a home here
at the house of hamburgers.

177
00:09:07,845 --> 00:09:10,345
Benjamin, I'm calling
your father!

178

Girl, you look like
a pot o' chitlins!

179

Mm-hmm. raise on
up and let me see
them candied yams.

180
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:30,820
Okay, baby.

Shit, Benny!
You wanna watch me fuck,

186
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:45,088
I'll put you in the closet
or some shit like that!

187
00:09:45,086 --> 00:09:47,526
- But ask first!
- My fault, durrel.

188
00:09:47,525 --> 00:09:50,525
Come back here, baby.
Durrel still loves you.

189
00:09:53,537 --> 00:09:56,677
Benjamin!

They ran outta meat.
"They ran outta meat"?

00:10:01,686 --> 00:10:04,356
Yo, come inside
and help your mother pack.

Man, if he calls my dad,
I'm dead.

Man, relax.
Ain't nobody

Benny, let me speak
to your father.

I'm sorry, I can't let
you do that right now.

Benny, put your father

I'm sorry.
You have the wrong number.

but if you call back we can

Bye-bye.

Yo, durrel, I'm dead, man.
What am I gonna do?

207

00:10:49,147 --> 00:10:52,917
- Leave the phone
off the hook.
- Yeah. You're right.

Father:

Mow the lawn.
- Easy on the door, Benjamin.

216

- Keep your room clean and stay
off the phone. Okay, baby?
- I'm not a baby.

Ohh! baby, get up.
Can I help you?

Pull yourself together.
Are you all right?

- What "again"?

221
00:11:23,315 --> 00:11:25,985
- Just get the map.
- Look, we're going up
and down the coast.

222
00:11:25,988 --> 00:11:28,288
As long as the ocean's
next to us, we'll be fine.

Thinner than an elephant.

Actually,

- Yeah, right.
- She told me!

605

- Real big.
- Bullshit.

607

No, man. No offense,

Whip that Booty.
Tame that ass.

618
00:31:56,379 --> 00:31:58,379
- But leave the lights off.

- See, man! Don't talk?
- No need for talk.

I thought maybe I'd read
her a little poetry
to get her goin'.

She don't need

- You're fucking with me.
You're bullshitting.
- No!

624
00:32:10,441 --> 00:32:13,651
Did she say
she wants me or not?

- Not exactly.
- Oh.

626

00:45:10,132 --> 00:45:13,042
Shhh--
i feel so alone.

891
00:45:14,641 --> 00:45:18,181
Like a seashell
washed up on the seashore,

892
00:45:18,181 --> 00:45:21,191
waiting for the tide to

893
00:45:21,187 --> 00:45:23,387
wash me back

894
00:45:23,391 --> 00:45:26,901
so I can find my one
and only true love.

895
00:45:28,235 --> 00:45:31,905
That was nice.
Where did you hear it?

896
00:45:31,909 --> 00:45:35,319
- Actually, I wrote it.
- Really?

897
00:45:35,315 --> 00:45:38,355
- Yeah.
- it's beautiful.

898
00:45:38,355 --> 00:45:41,495
I'm Denise.
What's your name?

899
00:45:41,495 --> 00:45:43,425
<i>I'm Benny.</i>

900
00:45:43,432 --> 00:45:47,142
Me and my friend durrel
came down to make some money.

901
00:45:47,139 --> 00:45:49,679
- Have you made any?
- No.

902
00:45:50,747 --> 00:45:52,947
It's durrel!

903
00:45:52,951 --> 00:45:55,961
All he wants to do is
pick up women on the beach,

904
00:45:55,957 --> 00:45:58,257
and I'm tired of this.

905
00:45:58,261 --> 00:46:02,241
I don't understand.
All I need is one girl.

906
00:46:02,236 --> 00:46:04,166
Candace?

907
00:46:04,173 --> 00:46:07,483
Everybody
likes Candace.

908
00:46:11,054 --> 00:46:13,564
Well, it's nice
seeing you, Benny.

909
00:46:13,559 --> 00:46:15,729
Hopefully I'll see
you again.

910
00:46:15,730 --> 00:46:17,930
And maybe you can read
some of my stuff--

911
00:46:17,934 --> 00:46:20,944
- I mean, <i>your</i> stuff.
- Yeah, I'd like that.

912
00:46:43,886 --> 00:46:47,356
( Voices echoing )
Mr. lifeguard, save me!
Please! Save me!

913
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:49,699
I need you
more than she does.

914
00:46:49,698 --> 00:46:51,368
Can you give me
mouth-to-mouth?

915
00:46:51,367 --> 00:46:53,367
Pump my chest.
I'm not breathing.

916
00:46:53,371 --> 00:46:56,951
Actually, um, I'm not finished
with my training course yet,

917
00:46:56,945 --> 00:47:00,745
but, uh,
i would practice on her.

918
00:47:14,714 --> 00:47:17,024
Ohh! ohh!

919
00:47:17,019 --> 00:47:19,259
Aaah! my radio!

920
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:22,930
Ohh!
look at it!

921
00:47:22,931 --> 00:47:25,771
Man! ohh!

922
00:47:32,282 --> 00:47:35,622
Hey, fatso, can you
throw the ball back?

923
00:47:35,623 --> 00:47:39,563
- What?
- you heard me, chubby.
Throw the ball back.

924
00:47:39,564 --> 00:47:41,574
- You want this?
- Yeah!

925
00:47:43,939 --> 00:47:47,679
Boy:
<i>mom!</i>

926
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:50,090
Mom!

927
00:47:50,085 --> 00:47:53,115
That was a crazy serve.

928
00:47:53,124 --> 00:47:56,674
We were gonna go play
some volleyball over there.
You wanna join us?

929
00:47:56,665 --> 00:47:59,495
No, I'll just go
back home to the room.

930
00:47:59,504 --> 00:48:01,144
Come on, man.
We need that.

931
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:04,980
Hey, uh, did you hear
about that big volleyball
tournament tomorrow?

932
00:48:04,981 --> 00:48:06,991
Mm-mmm.

933
00:48:06,985 --> 00:48:09,755
Shit.

934
00:48:09,758 --> 00:48:13,828
So we can win $10,000
just like that.

935
00:48:13,832 --> 00:48:17,342
- Are you any good?
- Please.

936
00:48:23,184 --> 00:48:25,394
See ya.

937
00:48:25,388 --> 00:48:27,388
Well, all right.

938
00:48:27,392 --> 00:48:29,902
But this is
just business,

939
00:48:29,898 --> 00:48:31,898
not social.

940
00:48:31,902 --> 00:48:34,472
Who's thinkin'
about social, baby?

941
00:48:34,474 --> 00:48:36,884
Sir, sir, sir,
sir, sir, sir!

942
00:48:36,878 --> 00:48:38,918
Hey!
what's up, bro?

943
00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:41,886
- What's goin' on?
- My car over there
just won't start.

944
00:48:41,888 --> 00:48:44,088
I think something's
broke or something.

945
00:48:44,093 --> 00:48:47,373
- Can you help a brother out?
- Yeah, I think I can help
a brother out.

946
00:48:47,366 --> 00:48:51,166
Can I just rub a little
lotion on your back
so you don't burn?

947
00:48:51,173 --> 00:48:54,813
No. I don't burn,
and I don't want
your hands on my ass.

948
00:48:54,814 --> 00:48:56,824
Yo, Mikey!
They're towing your Jeep!

949
00:48:56,818 --> 00:48:59,288
- Oh, look, it's your shadow.
- I tried to stop him,

950
00:48:59,290 --> 00:49:01,760
- but old boy wouldn't listen.
- Thought you had a Porsche.

951
00:49:01,762 --> 00:49:04,702
It's in the shop. Shit!
Get your friends for tomorrow.

952
00:49:04,701 --> 00:49:07,711
Damn, that's a nice
Jeep you used to have.

953
00:49:07,707 --> 00:49:09,407
Alone at last.

954
00:49:09,410 --> 00:49:11,720
Mmm.
you're about to be.

955
00:49:11,715 --> 00:49:13,715
Ugh.

956
00:49:13,719 --> 00:49:15,719
Uh...

957
00:49:15,723 --> 00:49:19,263

983
00:50:36,485 --> 00:50:38,085
Bakersfield.

984
00:50:38,087 --> 00:50:40,687
You can't go home.
We ain't made a sale yet.

00:50:40,693 --> 00:50:42,633

talkin' about?

987
00:50:44,634 --> 00:50:46,974
While you was back there
stinkin' up my dad's car,

988
00:50:46,972 --> 00:50:50,582
- the sunglasses got stolen.
- Stolen?

Don't even

- Hi, Benny.

Ugh!
how do you
know <i>him?</i>

give you?

- ( Laughing )
- wow.

1008
00:51:56,845 --> 00:51:58,845
I think that's
really eloquent.

1009
00:51:58,849 --> 00:52:01,789
Well, if that means
stupid, I agree.

1010

You guys are coldhearted.
He's a really nice guy.

1011
00:52:04,727 --> 00:52:07,627
- Not like his friend durrel.
- Both: Durrel?

1012
00:52:07,633 --> 00:52:10,003
Benny says he's scamming
all the time.

1013
00:52:10,004 --> 00:52:13,514
Yeah, I'm leavin'
for the army tomorrow.
Goin' off to war.

1014
00:52:13,512 --> 00:52:16,522
Who knows if
I'll ever make it back.

1015
00:52:16,518 --> 00:52:18,518
Really?
which one?

1016
00:52:18,522 --> 00:52:21,032
Uh, you know,
that Saddam Hussein?

1017
00:52:21,026 --> 00:52:23,026
Vietnam.

1018
00:52:23,030 --> 00:52:25,070
Yeah. yeah.

1019
00:52:25,068 --> 00:52:27,938
- Tanya, don't
get jealous now.
- Please.

1020
00:52:27,940 --> 00:52:31,550
This morning I went for
a ride in his Mercedes.

1021
00:52:31,548 --> 00:52:33,748
- He got a Mercedes?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

1022
00:52:33,752 --> 00:52:36,762
- <i>Candace: hi. Durrel?</i>
- Call you if I make it back.

1023
00:52:38,027 --> 00:52:40,527
I've been looking
for you all day.

1024
00:52:40,532 --> 00:52:42,972
- Oh, really?
- Uh-huh.

1025
00:52:42,970 --> 00:52:45,480
- Who was that?
- Oh-- phhh!

1026
00:52:45,476 --> 00:52:47,406
( Laughs )
no one.

1027
00:52:47,412 --> 00:52:50,422
So, um, I thought
i wasn't your type.

1028
00:52:50,418 --> 00:52:53,928
Oh, come on.
That was just talk.

1029
00:52:53,925 --> 00:52:56,925
I didn't think
you'd give up
so easily.

1030
00:52:59,269 --> 00:53:02,339
So, um, what are you
doing tonight?

1031
00:53:02,342 --> 00:53:04,882
- Whatever you are, baby.
- ( Giggles )

1032
00:53:04,881 --> 00:53:06,951
Well, then,
what do you say

1033
00:53:06,951 --> 00:53:09,991
we go for a nice,
long ride along the coast?

1034
00:53:09,991 --> 00:53:14,171
I'd do anything
for just a nice,
relaxing ride.

Top down.

1036

Wind in my hair.

1037
00:53:19,744 --> 00:53:22,754
You know, I just
quiver all over

1038
00:53:22,750 --> 00:53:25,960
just thinking
about it.

1039
00:53:25,956 --> 00:53:28,496
Benny! Benny, man.
I've been lookin'
all over for you!

00:53:28,495 --> 00:53:32,335
- Where the hell you been?
- I'm just thinkin', man.

1041
00:53:32,335 --> 00:53:34,205
I needs to borrow
the car tonight.

1042
00:53:34,206 --> 00:53:36,306
- <i>What?</i>
- I need to borrow the car.
It's life or death!

1043
00:53:36,310 --> 00:53:39,150
- No.
- don't make me beg, man.

1044
00:53:39,149 --> 00:53:40,749
Get out of my face, durrel.

1045
00:53:40,752 --> 00:53:43,762
I'll get on my knees and beg
like a little baby dog.

1046
00:53:43,758 --> 00:53:47,268
Durrel, read my lips.
You're not touching
my dad's car!

1047
00:53:47,265 --> 00:53:48,895
But it's this girl, man.

1048
00:53:48,902 --> 00:53:51,512
- I think I really like her.
- Yeah, you like her, huh?

1049
00:53:51,507 --> 00:53:53,507
Like her enough to bounce
her on your dick?

1050
00:53:53,511 --> 00:53:55,981
No, man, I'm talkin' serious.
And I can get her if i--

1051
00:53:55,983 --> 00:53:59,263
- lie to her and tell her
you got a nice car?
- <i>No, it's not like that.</i>

1052
00:53:59,256 --> 00:54:02,256
- She don't care
if I drive a bicycle.
- Is that right?

1053
00:54:02,262 --> 00:54:06,802
Well, you'd better
get yourself a schwinn,
'cause I can't help you.

1054
00:54:06,804 --> 00:54:10,314
Remember love, man?
You told me you
were in love today.

1055
00:54:10,311 --> 00:54:13,381
I'd do anything to
help you get that girl.
So help me.

1056
00:54:13,384 --> 00:54:17,394
You know how you don't
like me abusing women.
This'll stop me.

1057
00:54:17,392 --> 00:54:21,172
I got a problem, man.
Help me, Benny. Save me.

1058
00:54:21,166 --> 00:54:22,736
You don't like this girl.

1059
00:54:22,736 --> 00:54:26,336
I think this could be the only
girl I'm ever with again, ever.

1060
00:54:26,343 --> 00:54:28,213
- You're lying.
- I'm serious!

1061
00:54:28,213 --> 00:54:30,523
- Who is she then?
- Met her at the beach.

1062
00:54:30,519 --> 00:54:33,629
This shit is amazing.
We both come down here

1063
00:54:33,625 --> 00:54:35,795
and fall in love
in the same day.

1064
00:54:35,796 --> 00:54:37,796
<i>What happened</i>
<i>with your girl?</i>

1065
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:40,810
I just gave her this poem
that I wrote for her.

1066
00:54:40,806 --> 00:54:43,846
Ah! aggressive.
What'd she say?

1067
00:54:43,845 --> 00:54:47,485
I don't know.
I ran away.

1068
00:54:47,486 --> 00:54:50,116
- You ran away?
- Isn't it amazing?

1069
00:54:50,124 --> 00:54:53,634
She's gonna be sitting
there wondering for the rest
of her life

1070
00:54:53,631 --> 00:54:55,841
what her life
could've been like

1071
00:54:55,836 --> 00:54:59,306
with this mysterious poet
she met on the beach, man.

1072
00:54:59,309 --> 00:55:02,649
Don't take much
to please you, does it?

1073
00:55:03,918 --> 00:55:06,918
( Sighs )
all right, durrel.

1074
00:55:06,924 --> 00:55:09,104
One of us might
as well get the girl.

1075
00:55:09,095 --> 00:55:10,925
But don't be fuckin'
in it!

1076
00:55:10,932 --> 00:55:13,372
- Here.
- I owe you big-time.

1077
00:55:13,370 --> 00:55:17,280
Yeah, you do. We're leaving
first thing in the morning,
come hell or high water.

1078
00:55:19,282 --> 00:55:22,292
Hey. here.

1079
00:55:24,827 --> 00:55:27,397
- Where you get this from?
- Set aside a little
emergency fund.

1080
00:55:27,398 --> 00:55:31,038
You been holdin' out on me!
You probably got some more.

1081
00:55:32,308 --> 00:55:34,178
Food.

1082
00:55:41,193 --> 00:55:43,633
Hey!
you get your car back?

1083
00:55:43,631 --> 00:55:45,641
Why?
you do that?

1084
00:55:45,635 --> 00:55:49,205
Nope, but I tell you what.
You can take it out of
the money you owe me.

1085
00:55:49,209 --> 00:55:51,379
Owe you?
The bet's over tomorrow.

1086
00:55:51,379 --> 00:55:54,919
Ah, tomorrow's too late.
I'm going to pick up
Candace right now.

1087
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:58,560
I'll wake you when
it's time for the show.
See ya!

1088
00:56:05,475 --> 00:56:08,475
( Giggling )

1089
00:56:08,481 --> 00:56:10,491
( Women speaking Swedish )

1090
00:56:36,002 --> 00:56:39,012
<i>( Moaning,</i>
<i>giggling continues )</i>

1091
00:56:40,277 --> 00:56:42,147
What's up?

1092
00:56:42,148 --> 00:56:44,648
Yo, what you got,
slimmy-slim?

1093
00:56:44,653 --> 00:56:46,593
What do I got?

1094
00:56:46,591 --> 00:56:49,601
Yeah, you know,
how you doin'?
What's goin' on?

1095
00:56:49,597 --> 00:56:51,967
I'm tryin' to eat.

1096
00:56:51,968 --> 00:56:54,008
Hey, you know where
your boy is?

1097
00:56:54,005 --> 00:56:56,235
I don't know.
He's out with some
girl or something.

1098
00:56:56,243 --> 00:56:58,253
Do you know
where they went?

1099
00:56:58,247 --> 00:57:01,147
- They in a hotel bar
right down there.
- This hotel?

1100
00:57:01,152 --> 00:57:03,262
- What do you need with him?
- Relax, my man.

1101
00:57:03,257 --> 00:57:05,997
I'm not looking for him.
I'm lookin' for that girl
that he's with.

1102
00:57:05,996 --> 00:57:09,436
I don't know about her,
but durrel's pretty much
into her.

1103
00:57:09,436 --> 00:57:11,436
Hopefully not before
I'm into her,

1104
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:13,410
if you know what
I'm sayin'.

1105
00:57:13,410 --> 00:57:16,250
- No.
- me and your boy
put a bet down.

1106
00:57:16,249 --> 00:57:19,089
Who could, you know,
wax that ass first.

1107
00:57:19,088 --> 00:57:23,058
A bet?
Durrel doesn't even have
anything to bet.

1108
00:57:23,063 --> 00:57:25,703
He put up his box
against my $300.

1109
00:57:25,702 --> 00:57:28,312
His box?
That's my box!

1110
00:57:28,307 --> 00:57:31,807
Easy, big guy.
There's people tryin'
to sleep around here.

1111
00:57:31,814 --> 00:57:34,454
Man, to hell with you.

1112
00:57:34,453 --> 00:57:38,033
- Where you goin'?
- <i>To kill durrel.</i>

1113
00:57:38,026 --> 00:57:41,366
Durrel, that car
handles real nice.

1114
00:57:41,366 --> 00:57:43,366
Oh, yeah?
How do you handle?

1115
00:57:43,370 --> 00:57:46,310
Slow down, baby.
So, how long have
you had it?

1116
00:57:46,309 --> 00:57:48,309
- What?
- the car.

1117
00:57:48,313 --> 00:57:50,323
Oh, the car.
About two years.

1118
00:57:50,317 --> 00:57:52,317
Ever since I bought
the beach house.

1119
00:57:52,321 --> 00:57:54,331
Oh, really.
Is it right
on the beach?

1120
00:57:54,325 --> 00:57:56,825
- Right on the Atlantic.
- You mean the pacific.

1121
00:57:56,831 --> 00:57:58,841
That too.

1122
00:57:58,835 --> 00:58:02,775
Why don't we go back
to your beach house?

1123
00:58:02,776 --> 00:58:05,776
Now you're talkin'.

1124
00:58:05,782 --> 00:58:08,222
Well, I'm just
gonna go freshen up
a little bit, okay?

1125
00:58:08,220 --> 00:58:12,230
Baby, durrel give you all
the freshings you need.

1126
00:58:12,228 --> 00:58:14,468
- Can I drive?
- Drive?

1127
00:58:14,466 --> 00:58:17,436
Wreck that motherfucker
if you want to.

1128
00:58:17,439 --> 00:58:18,739
Whoo!

1129
00:58:18,741 --> 00:58:21,051
Well, ain't we just
the smooth talker?

1130
00:58:21,045 --> 00:58:23,175
- What's up, baby?
- I ain't your baby.

1131
00:58:23,183 --> 00:58:24,793
Whatever.

1132
00:58:24,787 --> 00:58:26,787
- <i>( Man hoots )</i>
- shit!

1133
00:58:26,791 --> 00:58:29,761
That's a $12 t-shirt
you just ruined!

1134
00:58:29,763 --> 00:58:31,773
Yeah, uh,
hi, officer.

1135
00:58:31,767 --> 00:58:35,807
I'm a handicapped man,
and this goddamn car

1136
00:58:35,809 --> 00:58:39,019
is just taking up
all them handicapped spots.

1137
00:58:39,015 --> 00:58:42,655
Yes, it's, um,
it's a convertible Mercedes.

1138
00:58:44,793 --> 00:58:47,263
- Hey, Benny.
- How you doin'?

1139
00:58:47,264 --> 00:58:48,844
Hi.
where you going?

1140
00:58:48,835 --> 00:58:50,835
I gotta find durrel.

1141
00:58:53,878 --> 00:58:57,278
- What's up, cuz?
- Don't "what's up, cuz?" Me.
This was a bet?

1142
00:58:57,284 --> 00:59:00,394
You fucked around
with my dad's car
and this was all a bet?

1143
00:59:00,390 --> 00:59:03,130
- Relax, man.
- And you betted my box?

1144
00:59:03,129 --> 00:59:05,599
- Benny, chill.
- Man, give me the keys.
I'm leaving.

1145
00:59:05,602 --> 00:59:07,612
Man, you way too uptight.

1146
00:59:07,606 --> 00:59:10,176
All weekend
you fucked around
with the glasses,

1147
00:59:10,177 --> 00:59:12,517
and you treated
every girl like shit.

1148
00:59:12,516 --> 00:59:15,146
Don't any of 'em mean
anything to you?

1149
00:59:15,153 --> 00:59:17,163
Nope.

1150
00:59:17,157 --> 00:59:19,157
Does this one even know
she's a bet?

1151
00:59:19,161 --> 00:59:21,671
What are you?
The leader of the women's
movement or something?

1152
00:59:21,667 --> 00:59:23,167
You act like
you know this girl.

1153
00:59:23,169 --> 00:59:24,739
Durrel, I don't have
to know her.

1154
00:59:24,740 --> 00:59:26,580
I just don't treat
people like that.

1155
00:59:26,577 --> 00:59:28,207
I don't care who
they are.

1156
00:59:28,213 --> 00:59:29,953
Hi, durrel.
You ready to go?

1157
00:59:29,950 --> 00:59:32,690
You. hi.
Thanks for that
poem today.

1158
00:59:32,689 --> 00:59:34,689
It was so sweet.

1159
00:59:37,699 --> 00:59:39,699
He gave you
a poem today?

1160
00:59:39,703 --> 00:59:41,713
Yeah.
mm-hmm.

1161
00:59:41,707 --> 00:59:44,007
Benny, I'm sorry, man!

1162
00:59:44,011 --> 00:59:46,021
Benny, I'm sorry, man.
I didn't know.

1163
00:59:46,015 --> 00:59:48,845
- How could you?
- I didn't know it
was your girl, man.

1164
00:59:48,854 --> 00:59:50,894
It shouldn't make
a difference whose girl
it was, durrel.

1165
00:59:50,892 --> 00:59:52,902
You're right.

1166
00:59:52,896 --> 00:59:54,896
- You're a lowlife.
- I know.

1167
00:59:54,900 --> 00:59:56,900
- A scumbag.
- I agree.

1168
00:59:56,904 --> 00:59:58,914
Lower than the animal.
Garbage!

1169
00:59:58,908 --> 01:00:01,748
Someone who just don't care
about nobody but theyself.

1170
01:00:01,747 --> 01:00:04,747
What can I say except
i can't help it.

1171
01:00:16,777 --> 01:00:18,777
Hey, wait, wait,
wait a minute.

1172
01:00:18,781 --> 01:00:20,791
I just saw my car.

1173
01:00:20,785 --> 01:00:23,815
Car?
does the word "obsession"
mean anything to you?

1174
01:00:23,824 --> 01:00:26,804
This is the fifth time
in two days we've seen
your one-in-a-million car.

1175
01:00:26,797 --> 01:00:29,097
No, baby.
I'm sure this time.

1176
01:00:29,101 --> 01:00:32,811
No, I'm sure you tired from
driving all over the world
trying to find a hotel.

1177
01:00:32,809 --> 01:00:35,619
Now, can we just
go in here and get
a good night's sleep?

1178
01:00:37,619 --> 01:00:40,789
More than any animal.
Garbage, trash.

1179
01:00:40,792 --> 01:00:43,532
A person who has no feelings
for anybody but himself.

1180
01:00:45,835 --> 01:00:47,765
We leaving tonight, man.
That's it.

1181
01:00:47,772 --> 01:00:49,782
Cool. all right.
Tonight.

1182
01:00:49,776 --> 01:00:52,276
That's right.
I just wanna forget
this weekend ever happened.

1183
01:00:52,281 --> 01:00:54,651
I called
Mr. Johnson back.

1184
01:00:54,653 --> 01:00:57,593
He said I can come back
to work as soon as I'm
physically ready.

1185
01:00:57,592 --> 01:00:59,302
Then we do it.

1186
01:00:59,295 --> 01:01:01,295
All right.
Let's just get
our bags and go.

1187
01:01:01,299 --> 01:01:03,299
- Okay.
- all right.

1188
01:01:03,303 --> 01:01:06,583
- There's just
one small problem.
- What?

1189
01:01:06,577 --> 01:01:10,077
It's a yellow Mercedes,
license plate "doctor t."

1190
01:01:10,083 --> 01:01:12,093
- $150!
- damn!

1191
01:01:12,087 --> 01:01:14,527
- Do I get a blow with that?
- Durrel, we'll never get
the car back!

1192
01:01:14,526 --> 01:01:16,556
Nothing, nothing, nothing.
Just a minute.

1193
01:01:16,563 --> 01:01:20,643
Give me all the money
you got, man.
I'll handle this.

1194
01:01:20,638 --> 01:01:23,138
That's all I got.

1195
01:01:23,143 --> 01:01:26,323
How 'bout $7
and some change?

1196
01:01:26,315 --> 01:01:28,815
- <i>( Dial tone )</i>
- hello? Hello?

1197
01:01:28,821 --> 01:01:31,831
Damn it!
They hung up on you!

1198
01:01:31,827 --> 01:01:34,827
We didn't have
enough money.

1199
01:01:34,833 --> 01:01:37,613
Here we are,
alone at last.

1200
01:01:37,605 --> 01:01:40,105
- Mm-hmm.
- this nice, warm bed...

1201
01:01:40,110 --> 01:01:42,080
- Mm-hmm.
- and this nice, warm room...

1202
01:01:42,080 --> 01:01:44,150
- Mm-hmm.
- next to that nice,
warm ocean.

1203
01:01:44,151 --> 01:01:47,361
- Mm-hmm.
- how 'bout some lovin'
for Mr. peppy?

1204
01:01:47,357 --> 01:01:50,357
Mr. peppy's
had a long, hard day.

1205
01:01:50,363 --> 01:01:53,373
Mr. peppy's day
wouldn't have been
so long and hard

1206
01:01:53,369 --> 01:01:56,379
if Mr. peppy
hadn't forgot the map.

1207
01:01:57,512 --> 01:01:59,522
Let's just go to sleep,

1208
01:01:59,516 --> 01:02:02,516
wake up in the morning
and forget this trip
ever happened.

1209
01:02:02,522 --> 01:02:05,462
Oh, but, baby,
it hasn't been that bad.

1210
01:02:05,461 --> 01:02:07,471
It's been real bad.

1211
01:02:07,465 --> 01:02:11,165
Benny: <i>how could</i>
<i>you be so stupid to park</i>
<i>in a handicapped zone?</i>

1212
01:02:11,172 --> 01:02:14,112
- Don't yell at me.
- Well, why did you
park there then?

1213
01:02:14,111 --> 01:02:17,121
Man, I didn't know
handicapped people
go dancing.

1214
01:02:17,117 --> 01:02:20,687
You think it's all a joke.
Well, now you know
they go dancing!

1215
01:02:20,691 --> 01:02:22,501
- Benny: <i>and--</i>
- durrel: <i>And?</i>

1216
01:02:22,495 --> 01:02:24,925
Benny:
<i>and we ain't got</i>
<i>no money for food</i>

1217
01:02:24,933 --> 01:02:27,513
<i>and I'm hungry and we ain't</i>
<i>got no money to get the car.</i>

1218
01:02:27,505 --> 01:02:30,075
Jesus Christ!

1219
01:02:30,076 --> 01:02:34,016
What else could you do
to fuck up my life?
Huh, durrel?

1220
01:02:34,018 --> 01:02:37,588
- What else could
possibly go wrong?
- <i>( Knocking )</i>

1221
01:02:37,592 --> 01:02:40,262
Father:
<i>hey, hold that shit down!</i>
<i>It's 3:00 in the morning!</i>

1222
01:02:40,263 --> 01:02:43,403
- Sounds like my father.
- Hey, open up.

1223
01:02:43,403 --> 01:02:45,343
( Whispering )
that <i>is</i> my father.

1224
01:02:45,340 --> 01:02:47,780
Get the door.

1225
01:02:47,779 --> 01:02:51,749
- Durrel?
- hey, Mr. king.
What's up?

1226
01:02:51,753 --> 01:02:53,763
What you doing
here?

1227
01:02:53,757 --> 01:02:55,897
Uh, just kickin' it.

1228
01:02:55,895 --> 01:02:58,895
Too bad Benny ain't here
kickin' it with you,

1229
01:02:58,901 --> 01:03:01,911
but he's bein'
responsible this summer,
earning a living for himself.

1230
01:03:01,907 --> 01:03:05,347
Yeah, that Benjamin
is one responsible kid
you got there.

1231
01:03:05,347 --> 01:03:07,547
Durrel,
hold it down.

1232
01:03:07,552 --> 01:03:09,562
Yes, sir, Mr. king.

1233
01:03:09,556 --> 01:03:11,556
- Good night.
- Good night.

1234
01:03:15,534 --> 01:03:17,544
- I'm outta here.
- Where you goin'?

1235
01:03:17,538 --> 01:03:19,538
To go tell my dad.

1236
01:03:19,542 --> 01:03:23,182
Yo, yo, yo. What's up?
You get your car back?

1237
01:03:23,182 --> 01:03:26,692
- You think it's funny?
- Take it easy! Take it easy!

1238
01:03:26,690 --> 01:03:29,930
- You think it's funny.
- It's not my fault
genius over here

1239
01:03:29,929 --> 01:03:32,699
doesn't know the difference
between handicapped and
mentally handicapped.

1240
01:03:32,702 --> 01:03:34,712
I'll let him
at you again!

1241
01:03:34,706 --> 01:03:38,206
I just came by to make sure
that show you promised
tonight wasn't going off.

1242
01:03:38,212 --> 01:03:40,382
- Bet's off.
- Bet's off? Wrong!

1243
01:03:40,383 --> 01:03:42,393
The bet
is just beginning.

1244
01:03:42,387 --> 01:03:46,597
Guess who's gonna be
playin' in the $10,000
tournament tomorrow? Me.

1245
01:03:46,596 --> 01:03:49,536
Maybe you and Mr. fitness
over here should put
a team together.

1246
01:03:49,536 --> 01:03:51,536
Ohh, that is
so funny!

1247
01:03:51,540 --> 01:03:54,710
Here's the best part:
Sweet little Candace
is on my team.

1248
01:03:54,712 --> 01:03:57,082
- I'm gonna get laid.
- You gonna get what?

1249
01:03:57,084 --> 01:04:00,864
- What's his problem, man?
- He gets crazy sometimes, man.

1250
01:04:02,127 --> 01:04:04,197
See you guys tomorrow.
Peace.

1251
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:08,170
And I'm gonna get laid!
( Laughs )

1252
01:04:08,172 --> 01:04:10,542
How we gonna get
my dad's car back?

1253
01:04:10,544 --> 01:04:12,554
Man, wake up! Shit.

1254
01:04:12,548 --> 01:04:15,548
- What?
- $10,000. Volleyball.

1255
01:04:15,554 --> 01:04:20,064
With that crazy serve
of yours and my skills,
we can't lose.

1256
01:04:20,063 --> 01:04:23,573
But, durell, I got to get
back home tomorrow
so I can go to work.

1257
01:04:23,570 --> 01:04:26,580
With $10,000,
you won't need to work.

1258
01:04:26,576 --> 01:04:30,986
And when Candace sees
that crazy serve of yours,

1259
01:04:30,985 --> 01:04:34,485
she gonna go crazy
for your shit.

1260
01:04:35,594 --> 01:04:37,604
Mmm.

1261
01:04:37,598 --> 01:04:39,598
Candace
watching you

1262
01:04:39,602 --> 01:04:43,742
in that little itty
bitty bikini of hers?

1263
01:04:46,215 --> 01:04:49,655
Well, where we gonna
get the players from?

1264
01:04:49,656 --> 01:04:53,656
Sorry, partners.
Yeah, I'm sorry.
That's right.

1265
01:04:53,664 --> 01:04:56,744
- You girls play volleyball?
- ( Giggling )

1266
01:04:58,206 --> 01:05:01,376
We're here to sign up for
that volleyball tournament.

1267
01:05:01,378 --> 01:05:04,318
- $25 sign-up fee, please.
- Say what, partner?

1268
01:05:04,318 --> 01:05:06,818
I said $25.

1269
01:05:06,823 --> 01:05:09,763
Durrel.
come here, man.

1270
01:05:09,762 --> 01:05:12,642
Where we gonna get $25 from
to play this game, man?

1271
01:05:12,635 --> 01:05:15,535
Chill, don't get your
panties in a wad.
I'll handle this.

1272
01:05:15,541 --> 01:05:19,581
Um, since
I'm so damn fine...
( Laughs )

1273
01:05:19,582 --> 01:05:21,592
How 'bout $7
and some change?

1274
01:05:21,586 --> 01:05:24,486
How about $25?

1275
01:05:24,492 --> 01:05:27,102
From now on,
I'm handling things.

1276
01:05:27,097 --> 01:05:30,337
- Hi, Benny!
- Hey, Denise.

1277
01:05:30,336 --> 01:05:33,906
- This here's
my friend durrel.
- Hi, durrel.

1278
01:05:35,413 --> 01:05:38,353
You look upset.
Is something wrong?

1279
01:05:38,352 --> 01:05:41,262
No. it's just that we can't
enter the tournament

1280
01:05:41,258 --> 01:05:44,128
because we don't have
the $25 entry fee.

1281
01:05:44,131 --> 01:05:46,141
I've got 20.

1282
01:05:46,135 --> 01:05:48,465
- Give it up!
- Shut up, durrel!

1283
01:05:49,809 --> 01:05:52,009
We can't take
your money, Denise.

1284
01:05:52,013 --> 01:05:54,123
I want you to have it.

1285
01:05:54,117 --> 01:05:57,457
Candace and Tanya
didn't even ask me
to play on their team,

1286
01:05:57,458 --> 01:06:00,458
so maybe I can help you
beat them.

1287
01:06:00,464 --> 01:06:03,674
If you win,
you can take me
to dinner or something.

1288
01:06:03,670 --> 01:06:06,510
- Okay. all right, cool.
- Tanya: <i>We've got to go!</i>

1289
01:06:06,509 --> 01:06:08,809
- Oh, thanks.
- <i>Oh, I've gotta go.</i>

1290
01:06:08,814 --> 01:06:12,624
- Hope to see you later.
- All right. Bye, Denise.

1291
01:06:12,621 --> 01:06:16,161
Hey, yo, man.
Old girl got it
goin' for you.

1292
01:06:16,161 --> 01:06:19,871
Yo, man, it ain't even
like that with me and her.
Me and her are just friends.

1293
01:06:19,869 --> 01:06:23,509
Man, friends are just girls
that you haven't fucked yet.

1294
01:06:23,510 --> 01:06:25,510
- Durrel, do me a favor.
- What's up?

1295
01:06:25,514 --> 01:06:28,824
Just shut the fuck up.
Let's go get the girls.

1296
01:06:28,820 --> 01:06:31,730
25!
now where that court at?

1297
01:06:34,164 --> 01:06:36,174
Yo, yo, check it out!

1298
01:06:36,168 --> 01:06:39,268

Yo, let's break for lunch.

Hey, yo, fat man, don't
fill up on the free hot dogs.

1321

This food alone

01:08:44,257 --> 01:08:45,787
was on the '88 olympic team.

1328
01:08:45,794 --> 01:08:48,234
- Tournament's all wrapped up.
- We'll see, baby.

1329
01:08:48,232 --> 01:08:51,172
We got a little
secret weapon of our own.

1330
01:08:52,273 --> 01:08:56,013
Hey, Benny.
Good foot-long?

1331
01:08:56,014 --> 01:08:58,254
Mm-hmm.

1332
01:08:59,354 --> 01:09:03,664
Uh, so, I just
wanted to tell you,

1333
01:09:03,663 --> 01:09:05,873
that poem you wrote me--

1334
01:09:05,867 --> 01:09:07,867
it was so romantic.

1335
01:09:07,871 --> 01:09:11,681
And I didn't know
how to approach you,

1336
01:09:11,679 --> 01:09:14,249
but...

1337
01:09:15,987 --> 01:09:17,987
Good luck.

1338
01:09:17,991 --> 01:09:19,931
( Chuckles )
ohh. Whoo.

1339
01:09:19,929 --> 01:09:22,939
Good luck to you too!

1340
01:09:22,935 --> 01:09:25,035
Uh, i-i hope you win!

1341
01:09:29,180 --> 01:09:31,550
Daddy, look.
It's Benny.

1342
01:09:31,552 --> 01:09:33,222
Benny?

1343
01:09:33,222 --> 01:09:35,892
Benny. Benny!

1344
01:09:35,894 --> 01:09:38,434
What?

1345
01:09:38,433 --> 01:09:41,173
- Oh, shit!
- What the hell
you doin' here?

1346
01:09:41,171 --> 01:09:43,581
Uh, I got a volleyball
tournament over there.

1347
01:09:43,576 --> 01:09:46,146
Volleyball?
you're supposed
to be working!

1348
01:09:47,150 --> 01:09:48,990
They gave me
the weekend off.

1349
01:09:48,987 --> 01:09:52,187
- I bet he got fired.
- Let your father
handle this.

1350
01:09:52,193 --> 01:09:55,133
- Wish you'd shut up.
- How'd you get here?

1351
01:09:55,132 --> 01:09:57,142
- I walked.
- <i>From Bakersfield?</i>

1352
01:09:57,136 --> 01:09:59,906
No, from the hotel.

1353
01:09:59,909 --> 01:10:02,709
Hotel?
Benny, get your shit.
You're going home.

1354
01:10:02,714 --> 01:10:06,024
- But, dad, this is for money.
- You can't play volleyball.

1355
01:10:06,021 --> 01:10:09,291
- How would you know?
- Oh, look at you!
Your condition!

1356
01:10:09,294 --> 01:10:11,434
You never let me
do anything!

1357
01:10:11,432 --> 01:10:14,512
All you say
is, "you're too fat,
you're too clumsy."

1358
01:10:14,505 --> 01:10:18,005
- All I wanted to do
this summer was write.
- I got you a job.

1359
01:10:18,011 --> 01:10:20,621
Yeah, flippin' burgers.
How far is that gonna get me?

1360
01:10:20,617 --> 01:10:23,357
At least if I win,
i can pay for my poetry class.

1361
01:10:23,355 --> 01:10:25,085
Yeah, and if you lose,
how you gonna eat?

1362
01:10:25,092 --> 01:10:26,702
Benny, get your shit.
You're going home!

1363
01:10:28,398 --> 01:10:30,398
I'll diet.

1364
01:10:30,402 --> 01:10:33,412
Dad, I love you,
but this is somethin'
i gotta do.

1365
01:10:33,408 --> 01:10:36,618
And if I lose,
I'll deal with it my way.

1366
01:10:36,616 --> 01:10:38,986
Bye, ma.
See you later.

1367
01:10:42,226 --> 01:10:44,726
The boy's got some fight.

1368
01:10:44,732 --> 01:10:47,442
Takes after me.

1369
01:10:47,437 --> 01:10:50,377
Hey, yo, yo, yo!
We're down to the final
two teams

1370
01:10:50,376 --> 01:10:52,376

of $10,000! $10,000!

1373
01:11:05,473 --> 01:11:08,483
Yo, the blue team
has been awarded the serve.

1374
01:11:08,479 --> 01:11:10,979
They been spankin'
that ass all day.

1375
01:11:10,984 --> 01:11:13,994
The fat man's been on it.
I think the red team's
in trouble.

1376
01:11:13,990 --> 01:11:16,560
- What y'all think?
- ( Cheering )

1377

Ohh! oh.
Almost. Almost.

Why didn't you
get it?

1399
01:13:04,377 --> 01:13:07,277
- Come on, sweetheart.
- Nah, nah. See?
You can't play.

1400
01:13:07,283 --> 01:13:10,793
You're boring me!
You're boring me.

No, no, no,
no, no, Benny!

1405
01:13:43,589 --> 01:13:46,629
Oh, that serve was just
a little too hard for me.

1406
01:13:48,633 --> 01:13:51,143
Maybe you could hit it
just a little bit lighter?

1407
01:13:51,137 --> 01:13:52,807
Sure. okay.

1408
01:13:52,807 --> 01:13:55,807
- Benny, don't go
for that bullshit!
- Listen.

1409

If you lose, we could go
for a nice walk, me and you.

- Benny, come on, man!

1411
01:14:04,230 --> 01:14:06,170
And if I win?

1412

doing anything
