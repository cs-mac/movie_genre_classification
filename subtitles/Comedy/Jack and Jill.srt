1
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:37,121
BOTH: And we were born
on September 15...

2
00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:38,672
1989.

3
00:00:38,747 --> 00:00:40,499
And... And she's the older...
Older twin.

4
00:00:40,624 --> 00:00:42,001
I'm older by 10 minutes.
She's... Ten minutes.

5
00:00:42,084 --> 00:00:43,757
Cause she had
an umbilical cord

6
00:00:43,835 --> 00:00:45,303
wrapped around her neck.

7
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:47,632
And she, like, shoved me in
there and wouldn't let me out.

8
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:49,216
I was, like, kicking her in,

9
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:51,097
shoving her more in my mom,

10
00:00:51,218 --> 00:00:53,721
so that's why she came
out, like, later. Yeah.

11
00:00:53,804 --> 00:00:55,522
And... She came out
the bigger twin, too.

12
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:58,817
Well, I came out a pound
heavier than Kara,

13
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:00,986
so that's why
I'm an inch taller now.

14
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:03,280
She's always been,
like, a pound heavier.

15
00:01:03,355 --> 00:01:04,447
No.

16
00:01:04,815 --> 00:01:05,907
So, yeah, it's... You know,

17
00:01:05,983 --> 00:01:07,951
I love being twins, man.
It's, uh...

18
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:10,279
It's basically like you
have a bag of spare parts.

19
00:01:10,362 --> 00:01:11,363
Yeah. You know what I mean?

20
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:12,914
It's, like, I need a
kidney down the road,

21
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:14,992
I know he's got one,
so I'm always like,

22
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:16,622
"Hey, stay healthy, dude.
Eat right."

23
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:19,580
When we were kids, we had
our own secret language

24
00:01:19,663 --> 00:01:22,257
that only me and my
brother understood.

25
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:24,418
Ooh.

26
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:26,761
Eee.

27
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:29,219
Ooh.

28
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,676
I guess, when we were kids,
we thought we were whales.

29
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:34,348
Like, when things are bad,

30
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:35,771
we don't really got to say
anything to each other.

31
00:01:35,846 --> 00:01:37,439
We just make these sounds.
It's like...

32
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:39,733
(BOTH GRUNTING)

33
00:01:40,559 --> 00:01:42,561
So, I just graduated
from Harvard,

34
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:44,396
and I'm starting a new job

35
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,152
at a law firm
in Southern California,

36
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:48,199
so I'm really happy about that.

37
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:51,779
And I got a job at Hooters.
I'm happy, too.

38
00:01:51,862 --> 00:01:53,614
(CHUCKLING) Hooters!

39
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:56,450
Being a twin is like
being a married couple,

40
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:57,534
and you can't divorce her.

41
00:01:57,618 --> 00:02:00,792
Even, like! I mean, I love
her when we're together.

42
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:02,589
Well, actually, more so
when we're distant.

43
00:02:02,748 --> 00:02:04,341
She loves nature, like me.

44
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:07,386
She loves donating her
time to charities.

45
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:10,013
And she loves eating healthy,
so that's awesome.

46
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:11,965
She's my best friend.

47
00:02:12,049 --> 00:02:14,347
My best friend is my boyfriend.

162
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:16,544
JACK: I love my sister.

163
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:17,843
I love her shoes.

164
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:19,967
I love my sister.
I love her shoes.

165
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:28,896
JILL: Well, I just...

166
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:31,066
I can't find him anywhere.

167
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:33,360
Does he know
what terminal it is'?

168
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,652
I...

169
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:37,071
Okay, okay, I see him.

170
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:38,364
All right, I'm hanging up.

171
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:40,483
How are we doing?

172
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:42,361
Where were you?

173
00:06:42,444 --> 00:06:44,242
I've been waiting
forever for you.

174
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:45,868
This place is creeping me out.

175
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:47,999
Why so many bags?
Are the Knicks traveling with you'?

176
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:49,371
What is with this?
Mom always said,

177
00:06:49,451 --> 00:06:50,953
"it's better to have it
and not need it"

178
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:52,458
"than to need it
and not have it."

179
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:53,671
Oh, yeah, she did say that.

180
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:54,794
I remember that. That was cool.

181
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:56,382
Are you going bald?

182
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:57,584
Huh? No, no, no, no.

183
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:59,590
You're getting fatter, and
your hair doesn't realize

184
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:01,044
that it needs
to cover more face.

185
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:02,343
Okay. Where'd you put the car?

186
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:05,099
JACK: You really had
to bring your bird?

187
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:06,301
JILL: Yeah,
she's my best friend.

188
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:07,385
(SQUAWKS)

189
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,478
Anyways, Jill, I was thinking...
Yeah?

190
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:11,101
The house is going
to be very crowded

191
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:13,183
'cause we got the kids,
and all the guests

192
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:14,939
are coming by,
and blah, blah, blah.

193
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:16,736
So, there's this new hotel,

194
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:17,778
a Hilton that they
just built down...

195
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:20,277
But I want to spend time
with Sofie and Gary.

196
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:22,359
Why, do you not want me
to stay with you?

197
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,410
No, no, no, no. Of course
I want you to stay with us.

198
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:25,658
I was just...
I was just saying.

199
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:27,580
Okay, I'll stay with you, then.

200
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:30,538
It's too bad, 'cause the hotel
was starting to sound fun.

201
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:32,452
(SIGHS) Why are you doing that?

202
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:34,082
Why do you sigh so loud?

203
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:37,040
I just really, really
love your shoes.

204
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:38,632
You are so weird.

205
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,301
Isn't he weird, Poopsie?

206
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:42,295
POOPSIE: Where were you?
(LAUGHS)

207
00:07:42,671 --> 00:07:44,264
Poopsie gets it.

208
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:46,261
Yeah. Poopsie really gets it.

209
00:07:46,383 --> 00:07:48,306
(STRAINED SQUAWKING)
She always did get it.

210
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:49,386
I... It's just...

211
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,346
She always loved getting it.

212
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:54,315
And then your dad and I
went to the soup kitchen,

213
00:07:54,391 --> 00:07:55,859
and they gave us Otto

214
00:07:55,934 --> 00:07:58,028
to bring to Thanksgiving
dinner this year.

215
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:01,068
Thanks again for having me.
It's very nice.

216
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:03,070
Are you going to eat
dinner with us tonight'?

217
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:04,484
Yes, he is, honey.

218
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:05,906
And what about tomorrow night'?

219
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:08,989
Tomorrow, Otto's going
to go back home...

220
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:10,073
<i>Less.</i>

221
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:12,079
Sorry.

222
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:16,539
Uh, Sofia, show Otto
your karate moves.

223
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:18,878
(EXHALES)

224
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,334
You know, why don't...
Why don't you go wake up Jill?

225
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:22,920
What? It's 5:30.

226
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:25,092
She's here. That's
the important thing.

227
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:26,297
It counts <i>as</i> a day.

228
00:08:26,298 --> 00:08:28,265
So what? She's sleeping. Jack...

229
00:08:28,383 --> 00:08:30,932
All right, I'll go check on Jill.
Thank you.

230
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:32,888
(FIERCE GRUNTING)

231
00:08:33,722 --> 00:08:34,974
(SCREAMING)

232
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:37,024
It's okay, Otto.
It's just her...

233
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:45,116
(WHISPERING) Jill.

234
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:47,903
Wake up.

235
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:51,493
Okay, stay sleeping

236
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:52,745
Jet lag.

237
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:54,701
I have a gun! Oh, my God!

238
00:08:54,826 --> 00:08:56,328
(SQUAWKING) (JILL WHIMPERS)

239
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:58,212
You see, I live alone.

240
00:08:58,288 --> 00:09:01,383
Poopsie's trained
to watch out for me.

241
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:03,506
Don't sneak up
like that, all right'?

242
00:09:03,752 --> 00:09:05,004
Where were you?

243
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:06,638
(CHUCKLING) I don't...

244
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:09,223
Come downstairs.
Uh, the food's ready.

245
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:11,593
Can you just lay down
with me for five minutes?

246
00:09:11,843 --> 00:09:13,595
I'm not laying down
with you. No.

247
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:16,101
Come on. I just want
some twin time.

248
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:18,525
I'm a grown man.
I'm not laying next to you.

249
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,898
Just have Poopsie lay with you.
I... I don't know.

250
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:22,771
Aw. All right.

251
00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:26,575
I'll take a bath, and I'll meet
you downstairs in an hour.

252
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,402
(GRUNTS)

253
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:31,321
Good looking out, Poopsie.

254
00:09:32,614 --> 00:09:34,332
Don't forget your sweat shadow.

255
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:35,833
What?

256
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:38,711
All right, just take your
bath and all that stuff,

257
00:09:38,787 --> 00:09:40,835
and then burn those sheets.

258
00:09:41,873 --> 00:09:43,341
(ALL LAUGHING)

259
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:44,834
Hey, GUYS

260
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:46,924
Jill! You look amazing.

261
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:49,597
Aw. Macy's, Marshalls.

262
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:52,593
Hey, where am I sitting?

263
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:53,718
What do you mean?

264
00:09:53,802 --> 00:09:55,930
'Cause, usually,
I sit next to you.

265
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:57,764
So all of a sudden, I'm...
I'm not going to sit here?

266
00:09:58,181 --> 00:10:00,104
Oh, uh, would you...

267
00:10:00,183 --> 00:10:01,435
I thought you could
sit down here.

268
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:02,610
I always sit next to Jack.

269
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:05,154
(STUTTERING) ls there a
reason I'm moving? No.

270
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:07,278
Jill, if you'd like, you could sit here.
I'd be happy to move.

271
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:09,701
Oh, that's okay. You're fine.

272
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:11,870
If you want to... If you...
Do you want to sit here?

273
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:14,072
I don't know.

274
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:17,118
Okay, you just sit in my chair.
How's that?

275
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,247
There you go.
All right, thank you.

276
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:20,294
Gary, is that you?

277
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:21,411
Yes, it is.

278
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:23,506
Look how handsome you are.
Thank you.

279
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:24,798
It's so nice to see you.

280
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:26,751
Look at this leaf.
Look at this.

281
00:10:26,835 --> 00:10:28,178
You have it taped on you?

282
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:29,379
That's so cute. Yes.

283
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:30,509
Why did he do that?

284
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:31,840
He likes tape.

285

Hey. Sofie, is that you,
or is that you?

How was your flight?

Oh, the house looks amazing.

00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:42,270
You got a new chandelier?

Yeah, yeah.

00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:45,566
I loved the old one.

how's every body’s

Great. Excellent.

this is Otto. Otto.

(LOUDLY) Nice to meet you.

JILL: (WHISPERING)
He's homeless, right?

300
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:04,873
He seems clean,
but you should put

301
00:11:04,956 --> 00:11:07,334
one of those toilet seat
protectors underneath him

302
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:10,091
to make sure he doesn't
ruin the chair.

303
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,264
Are you whispering with
a bullhorn or something'?

00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:14,761
Everybody hears you.

No, they can't,
Mr. Hearing Expert.

00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,307
JILL: So...
Pass that down, Daddy.

307
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:23,858
I'm allowed out here
once a year,

308
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:24,934
so I tend to miss things.

309
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:26,520
What's going on? Anything new'?

310
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:30,449
Well, Sofie just got her
green belt in karate.

311
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:33,702
How come I didn't
know about this?

312
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:36,620
I didn't even know she did karate.
What... I mean,

313
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:38,995
I feel like I'm in the
Twilight Zone right now.

314

I'm like Jimmy Stewart
at the end of that movie,

the one where... They...
They're in Pottersville.

316
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:46,589
What... What is that...
That movie called?

317
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:48,132
<i>It's a Wonderful Life?</i>

318
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:49,676
No, no, with Jimmy Stewart.

319
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:52,470
The... The one where he meets

Why do you keep saying that?

00:11:56,174 --> 00:11:58,393
No, the one where
he falls in the pool

He gets all the money
at the end,

325

Your brother didn't
make me do anything, Jill.

331
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,414
Everyone has to be
like Jack over here.

332

JAC K: What?
What does that mean?

334
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:25,287
You made him switch
from being Indian.

What is wrong with you?

336
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:28,540
We adopted him when
he was 10 days old.

337
00:12:28,623 --> 00:12:30,000
This is all he knows.

338

Did you ever think maybe
he tapes things to himself

339
00:12:33,503 --> 00:12:35,756
'cause he doesn't
feel connected?

You know, to his real parents'?

341

That was very smart.
I just thought of that.

342

What? Why are you
making a face?

When we were kids, you felt
it when I broke my ankle.

Tell me you don't feel this.

358
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,382
I didn't feel it.
Maybe if you did it harder.

359

Yeah, no, I'm fine.

He didn't 100% connect.

I... I actually did
feel something there.

I'm so sick of that.

Why are you so afraid to
admit that we are connected?

Face it.

On the show,
there were these twins,

and they finished
each other's sentences.

380

Jack, maybe you could
start a sentence,

No. No.

that Aunt Jill used to call your
dad when they were growing up.

I was Pokee, and your
father was Pagogo.

Jack, don't.

No, no.

Does he want to go out again?

Whatever.

986

He was such a...

987

I thought he was cool
for a second.

you deserve to go out

who treats you right.

990

Yes, yes, stay calm.

And, uh, Mr. Pacino,

1033
00:37:59,861 --> 00:38:02,080
I actually met you one
time at a movie premiere.

1034
00:38:06,493 --> 00:38:07,790
He's thirsty.

in the same row.

1038
00:38:13,166 --> 00:38:14,793
One of your kids
knocked over your popcorn,

1039
00:38:14,876 --> 00:38:16,423
and I gave you mine.

1040

And you called me "Popcorn"
the rest of the night.

Hey, what's with the beard?

1044

You look a little
like Bin Laden.

1116
00:40:57,830 --> 00:40:59,082
Okay, thank you.

1117
00:40:59,165 --> 00:41:00,917
Aw, happy birthday, you guys.
Okay.

1118
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,468
No, no, no, not yet, not yet!

1119
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:04,261
I wasn't born yet. I'm 6:33.

1120
00:41:04,337 --> 00:41:06,305
I'm still 42, Erin. Oh, God.

1121
00:41:06,381 --> 00:41:07,633
So how does it feel, old man?

1122
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:09,092
Getting rickety in the bones?

1123
00:41:09,175 --> 00:41:10,768
(LAUGHS)

1124
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:12,436
I'm so bummed that
you're leaving tomorrow.

1125
00:41:12,512 --> 00:41:13,764
I'm going to miss you.

1126
00:41:13,846 --> 00:41:15,439
Oh, yeah. Oh, God.

1127
00:41:15,515 --> 00:41:16,767
I'm going to miss...

1128
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:18,146
I'm going to miss
you guys, too.

1129
00:41:18,226 --> 00:41:19,398
Especially on New Year's.

1130
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:21,445
Get the violins going, yeah.

1131
00:41:21,854 --> 00:41:24,824
It's just, every year, I'd
go with Mom to Valentino's.

1132
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:27,322
It's the restaurant, Erin,
where my mother met my father.

1133
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:29,821
Oh, I knew that was
going to be big.

1134
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:31,618
Don't throw it out.

1135
00:41:31,698 --> 00:41:33,416
We can make
a birthday candle with it.

1136
00:41:37,078 --> 00:41:39,001
Hey, we're only
40 minutes late, guys.

1137
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,957
<i>I hope they sing
Happy Birthday to us.</i>

1138
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,963
Yeah, I hope we still have
our table there, Slick.

1139
00:41:43,042 --> 00:41:44,339
Why is it so dark in here?

1140
00:41:44,419 --> 00:41:45,796
Are we going to get
killed or something'?

1141
00:41:45,878 --> 00:41:47,471
ALL: Surprise!

1142
00:41:47,547 --> 00:41:48,969
Oh, my God.

1143
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:50,516
Jack, we got you.

1144
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:52,309
You are having a party for us?

1145
00:41:52,385 --> 00:41:54,183
Oh, coolness!

1146
00:41:54,262 --> 00:41:55,730
Every body’s here.

1147
00:41:55,805 --> 00:41:58,604
And I just had to meet
your twin sister.

1148
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:00,651
Very nice to see you.

1149
00:42:00,727 --> 00:42:03,321
I mean, you guys
really do look alike.

1150
00:42:03,396 --> 00:42:04,818
I say that all the time.

1151
00:42:04,897 --> 00:42:06,149
<i>He says no.</i>

1152
00:42:06,232 --> 00:42:07,859
Jill, I want
to introduce you around.

1153
00:42:07,942 --> 00:42:10,320
(NERVOUS CHUCKLE) This is
going to be a bad night.

1154
00:42:10,403 --> 00:42:12,201
This is going to be
an awful, awful night.

1155
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,281
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

1156
00:42:13,573 --> 00:42:14,870
Really, it's fascinating.

1157
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:16,542
So, how does it work,
Mr. Subway Sandwich?

1158
00:42:16,617 --> 00:42:17,834
Just, well, just tell me more.

1159
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:18,957
Just Jared's fine.

1160
00:42:19,037 --> 00:42:20,459
Call you Jared? Okay, sure.

1161
00:42:20,747 --> 00:42:22,499
It's just,
10 sandwiches a day...

1162
00:42:22,582 --> 00:42:24,550
To me, that seems too much,
almost like a job.

1163
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:25,717
I couldn't do that.

1164
00:42:25,793 --> 00:42:27,045
I don't eat that many. No?

1165
00:42:27,128 --> 00:42:28,801
Okay, okay,
here's the situation.

1166
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:31,011
You're here, there's
not a Subway in sight.

1167
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:32,387
You're at a steakhouse
like this.

1168
00:42:32,467 --> 00:42:33,844
What do you eat?
What do you eat'?

1169
00:42:33,926 --> 00:42:35,553
I eat other things.
Oh, you do'?

1170
00:42:35,636 --> 00:42:36,728
You do'? I knew
you were cheating.

1171
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:38,602
That's why there's so
much goo left on you.

1172
00:42:38,931 --> 00:42:40,023
What?

1173
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:41,351
I miss the old Jared,

1174
00:42:41,434 --> 00:42:43,402
the 400-pound Jared
that scared us.

1175
00:42:43,478 --> 00:42:44,650
I don't miss that one at all.

1176
00:42:45,146 --> 00:42:47,399
Well, I'm sure you don't.
But if he was around, he'd be with me

1177
00:42:47,482 --> 00:42:48,779
and not with the two hookers.

1178
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:53,746
JILL: Well, yeah,
we love musicals.

1179
00:42:53,821 --> 00:42:55,038
You know what?

1180
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:56,411
You're the Sham-Wow man, right?

1181
00:42:56,491 --> 00:42:57,993
Yeah. Funny story.

1182
00:42:58,159 --> 00:43:00,787
Uh, Jack used to be a bed-wetter.
MEN: No!

1183
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:02,918
He could have used one
of these Sham-Wow things

1184
00:43:02,997 --> 00:43:04,715
20 years ago for
his pee puddles.

1185
00:43:04,791 --> 00:43:06,384
(LAUGHING)

1186
00:43:06,459 --> 00:43:07,711
Oh, there's Mr. Yellow Sheets!

1187
00:43:07,794 --> 00:43:10,047
(ALL LAUGHING)

1188
00:43:10,129 --> 00:43:11,676
BILLY: Where you
going, Puddles?

1189
00:43:12,632 --> 00:43:15,101
All right,
nice to meet you all.

1190
00:43:15,176 --> 00:43:17,474
Am I crazy or is she hot?

1191
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:19,104
You're crazy.

1192
00:43:19,347 --> 00:43:21,224
IRVIN: It's Jack with boobs.

1193
00:43:21,307 --> 00:43:23,105
Jack with boobs. That's right.

1194
00:43:23,184 --> 00:43:24,481
There he is!

1195
00:43:25,186 --> 00:43:27,109
Dude, did you set
this whole thing up'?

1196
00:43:27,188 --> 00:43:28,280
Yeah, we got through it, man.

1197
00:43:28,356 --> 00:43:29,573
It came out pretty dope,
I think.

1198
00:43:29,649 --> 00:43:31,196
It's amazing. Hey, Jill.

1199
00:43:32,193 --> 00:43:33,786
I'm sorry to interrupt.
Come here for a sec.

1200
00:43:33,861 --> 00:43:35,113
Okay, nice to see you.

1201
00:43:35,196 --> 00:43:36,573
What's going on?

1202
00:43:36,656 --> 00:43:38,579
Did I ever tell you
Todd is an atheist?

1203
00:43:38,866 --> 00:43:39,867
A what?

1204
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:41,411
Oh, God.

1205
00:43:41,494 --> 00:43:42,746
(CHUCKLES)
Have a great time, guys.

1206
00:43:42,829 --> 00:43:44,957
No. How could
there be a Grand Canyon

1207
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:46,461
if God didn't exist?

1208
00:43:46,541 --> 00:43:48,088
Right. (STUTTERS)
That's a very good point.

1209
00:43:48,167 --> 00:43:49,635
I'm just saying,
you know, maybe...

1210
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:53,135
Maybe God wouldn't have given you a
rat face if you believed in him.

1211
00:43:53,214 --> 00:43:54,306
I don't have a rat face.

1212
00:43:54,382 --> 00:43:56,009
Yes, you do have a rat face!
It's scary.

1213
00:43:56,092 --> 00:43:57,469
McENROE: Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, wait a minute.

1214
00:43:57,552 --> 00:43:58,519
This guy doesn't
believe in God?

1215
00:43:58,594 --> 00:43:59,641
No!

1216
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:00,972
No, no, I'm just saying

1217
00:44:01,055 --> 00:44:02,602
that there's not real proof.

1218
00:44:02,682 --> 00:44:05,982
Idiots like you
really make me mad!

1219
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:07,482
Fight! Fight! Fight him!

1220
00:44:07,562 --> 00:44:08,984
(CHANTING) Fight! Fight! Fight!

1221
00:44:09,063 --> 00:44:10,815
Because I'm about
to US Open your skull!

1222
00:44:10,898 --> 00:44:13,321
CROWD: (CHANTING)
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

1223
00:44:13,401 --> 00:44:16,996
<i>ALL: ♪ Happy birthday to you</i>

Come on, make a wish,
you twins.

1229
00:44:35,214 --> 00:44:36,966
Okay, let's do it.
Where's the other cake?

1230
00:44:37,091 --> 00:44:38,718
There's not enough candles for both of us.
All right, Jill.

1231
00:44:39,051 --> 00:44:40,849
One cake's enough.
Make the wish.

1232
00:44:41,888 --> 00:44:43,640
Mom and Dad always
got us two cakes.

1233
00:44:44,557 --> 00:44:46,480
Made us both feel special.

1234
00:44:46,559 --> 00:44:48,311
I don't think Mom and Dad
would like this.

1235
00:44:48,394 --> 00:44:50,362
Make the wish already!
I'm hungry!

1236
00:44:50,605 --> 00:44:51,697
(EXHALES)
Will you stop already?

1237
00:44:51,772 --> 00:44:52,864
Blow out the candles.

1238
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:54,408
(INHALES DEEPLY)

00:45:06,621 --> 00:45:07,873
Whoa!

1241
00:45:08,331 --> 00:45:09,924
Funny meeting you here.

1242
00:45:11,626 --> 00:45:13,674
Don't be startled.
It's only me.

1243
00:45:14,295 --> 00:45:15,342
(LAUGHS)

1244
00:45:16,881 --> 00:45:18,178
AL: It's always the same thing.

1245
00:45:18,257 --> 00:45:19,224
It's L.A.

1246
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:20,517
I never know where I am.

1247
00:45:20,593 --> 00:45:21,719
It's a wilderness here.

1248
00:45:21,802 --> 00:45:23,850
I mean, in the Bronx,

1249
00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:25,853
you got the streets,
you got the numbers.

1250
00:45:25,932 --> 00:45:28,230
You got 187th, 188th.

1251
00:45:28,309 --> 00:45:29,856
Yeah, right, in order.
It follows in sequence.

1252
00:45:29,936 --> 00:45:32,280
Here, you got the palm trees,
and they all look alike.

1253
00:45:34,523 --> 00:45:36,491
I have no idea where we are.

1254
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:38,869
You really don't? I don't.

1255
00:45:38,945 --> 00:45:41,368
Lucky... Lucky for us,
I got the panic button.

1256
00:45:41,656 --> 00:45:43,033
You have a panic button?

1257
00:45:43,115 --> 00:45:45,493
Yeah, and we'll soon find
out where we are, huh?

1258
00:45:45,993 --> 00:45:47,836
(ALARM BLARING)

1259
00:45:49,163 --> 00:45:50,881
There we go. That's a house.

1260
00:45:50,957 --> 00:45:52,083
That's not a bakery.

1261
00:45:52,166 --> 00:45:53,338
Whether we go
in a bakery, a house,

1262
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:54,418
what difference does it make?

1263
00:45:54,502 --> 00:45:55,674
It makes a difference!

1264
00:45:55,962 --> 00:45:57,885
What do you mean?
There's a bakery in the house.

1265
00:45:57,964 --> 00:45:59,432
Get out of town! Come on.

1266
00:45:59,507 --> 00:46:01,009
I'm not going to your house.

1267
00:46:01,175 --> 00:46:02,768
I want to see
a birthday cake soon

1268
00:46:02,843 --> 00:46:04,766
or I'm taking pepper spray out.
I'm not kidding.

1269
00:46:04,845 --> 00:46:07,689
O ye of little faith.

1270
00:46:07,765 --> 00:46:09,392

getting there.

Burn this.

2233
01:25:29,625 --> 01:25:30,717
I'm sorry?

2234
01:25:32,836 --> 01:25:36,932
This must never
be seen by anyone.

2235
01:25:37,299 --> 01:25:39,927
If you didn't like all those
close-ups, we can, we can...

2236
01:25:40,010 --> 01:25:41,136
This is not the final cut.

2237
01:25:41,219 --> 01:25:42,266
There's no doubt,
we can, we can...

2238
01:25:42,346 --> 01:25:43,723
All copies.

2239
01:25:45,849 --> 01:25:47,099
Destroy them.

2240
01:25:47,100 --> 01:25:48,693
You want me to play it again?
Has anybody seen this?

2241
01:25:48,769 --> 01:25:50,146
Nobody has seen this.

2242
01:25:50,228 --> 01:25:52,196
They have to be found
and talked to.

2243
01:25:52,272 --> 01:25:54,775
All right, to be honest,
I showed my wife.

2244
01:25:54,858 --> 01:25:57,236
(CHUCKLING) She couldn't believe...
No good, no good.

2245
01:25:58,654 --> 01:26:00,782
So I used to be fatter,
and so what he would do...

2246
01:26:00,864 --> 01:26:02,616
Picture him way bigger, like...

2247
01:26:02,699 --> 01:26:04,997
So what would happen is we'd
get together on Thanksgiving.

2248
01:26:05,077 --> 01:26:06,545
He'd kind of gather
the family around,

2249
01:26:06,620 --> 01:26:08,918
and, and so I would have to go,

2250
01:26:09,456 --> 01:26:11,800
"This is me before
Ultra Slim Fast."

2251
01:26:11,875 --> 01:26:13,548
"And this is me now!"

2252
01:26:13,627 --> 01:26:14,844
And everybody
would laugh at him

2253
01:26:14,920 --> 01:26:15,967
and he'd go cry
in the other room.

2254
01:26:16,338 --> 01:26:18,511
I'm Larry, this is
my brother Dave.

2255
01:26:18,590 --> 01:26:21,764
We used to be triplets,
but he ate the other one.

2256
01:26:23,095 --> 01:26:24,438
Let me tell you, I don't,
I don't really like getting

2257
01:26:24,513 --> 01:26:25,685
into fights with him
because I really...

2258
01:26:25,764 --> 01:26:27,516
I don't like closing
my fist on him,

2259
01:26:27,599 --> 01:26:28,600
so when we get into fights,

2260
01:26:28,684 --> 01:26:30,186
we look like sissies
when we fight each other.

2261
01:26:30,268 --> 01:26:32,066
You know, 'cause I don't,
I don't really like...

2262
01:26:32,145 --> 01:26:33,863
It's kind of that...
The schoolyard fight

2263
01:26:33,939 --> 01:26:34,986
when you see two girls.

2264
01:26:42,906 --> 01:26:44,203
She's my baby girl,
she knows that.

2265
01:26:44,282 --> 01:26:45,875
We're like a husband-and-wife
relationship.

2266
01:26:45,951 --> 01:26:47,544
We fight and then we come together.
That's sick, okay?

2267
01:26:47,619 --> 01:26:49,087
I mean, not in a sick way.
You shouldn't say that

2268
01:26:49,162 --> 01:26:50,789
like that, that's sick.
Not in a sick way.

2269
01:26:51,289 --> 01:26:52,916
I don't like my brother.

2270
01:26:52,999 --> 01:26:55,752
I have a deep, intense
dislike for my brother.

2271
01:26:55,836 --> 01:26:56,883
He's a bad guy.

2272
01:26:57,295 --> 01:26:58,512
I know what the problem is.

2273
01:26:58,588 --> 01:27:01,057
He didn't say anything
about it, did he?

2274
01:27:01,133 --> 01:27:04,808
He don't like the mustache
'cause he can't grow one.

2275
01:27:05,303 --> 01:27:06,771
Well, usually, when we
celebrate a birthday,

2276
01:27:06,847 --> 01:27:08,064
usually it's more
than one cake.

2277
01:27:08,140 --> 01:27:09,107
It's four cakes.
It's usually four.

2278
01:27:09,182 --> 01:27:10,399
Yeah. It's usually four cakes.

2279
01:27:10,475 --> 01:27:12,694
There's right hand, left
hand, right hand, left hand.

2280
01:27:12,769 --> 01:27:14,237
Or one for me and one for him

2281
01:27:14,312 --> 01:27:15,359
and two for his girlfriend.

2282
01:27:15,439 --> 01:27:16,486
Yeah, yeah.

2283
01:27:16,648 --> 01:27:17,695
She was actually living in L.A.

2284
01:27:17,774 --> 01:27:20,072
And I was in Kentucky doing
the race at that moment.

2285
01:27:20,152 --> 01:27:21,404
I was tired. Yeah.

2286
01:27:21,486 --> 01:27:22,578
'Cause I did not
train properly.

2287
01:27:22,654 --> 01:27:23,655
And I started feeling,
like, these pains

2288
01:27:23,739 --> 01:27:25,741
or something like that, and
it was, like, weird, so...

2289
01:27:25,824 --> 01:27:29,169
So, yeah. I mean, that's my
part of, like, ESPN or ESP.

2290
01:27:29,244 --> 01:27:30,370
Whatever it's called. It's ESP.

2291
01:27:30,454 --> 01:27:32,456
Okay, whatever.
ESPN is the network for sports.

2292
01:27:32,831 --> 01:27:34,424
(BOTH SPEAKING SECRET LANGUAGE)

2293
01:27:37,627 --> 01:27:39,004
You figure it out.

2294
01:27:39,296 --> 01:27:40,923
Well, you know,
I'm married, so...

2295
01:27:41,006 --> 01:27:42,098
Yeah, we don't
have girl issues.

2296
01:27:42,174 --> 01:27:43,300
Yeah, well, I...
Sometimes, though,

2297
01:27:43,383 --> 01:27:45,010
I do try to hook him up
with someone.

2298
01:27:45,093 --> 01:27:46,185
I mean, if they come up to me

2299
01:27:46,261 --> 01:27:48,605
and they're like, they like
me, I'm like, "Oh, sorry,"

2300
01:27:48,680 --> 01:27:50,933
and then I'm like, "Hey,
look at this guy, though."

2301
01:27:51,016 --> 01:27:54,486
And so, I mean, he's kind
of like the backup twin.

2302
01:27:54,561 --> 01:27:55,858
I don't care, I take it.

2303
01:27:56,104 --> 01:27:57,321
I said, "Look, dude,
I don't think I can..."

2304
01:27:57,397 --> 01:27:58,694
"I don't think
I can go on this date,"

2305
01:27:58,774 --> 01:28:00,902
"but I can't,
can't break the date."

2306
01:28:00,984 --> 01:28:03,078
"'Cause, you know,
it's got to happen,"

2307
01:28:03,153 --> 01:28:04,530
"it's got to happen tonight."

2308
01:28:04,613 --> 01:28:05,705
I said, "Well,
Rog, you know..."

2309
01:28:05,781 --> 01:28:06,828
You said... What'd you...
What'd you tell me?

2310
01:28:06,907 --> 01:28:08,625
"How does the girl look?
How does she look?"

2311
01:28:08,700 --> 01:28:10,077
I said, "Dude, she's
a 10, she's hot."

2312
01:28:10,160 --> 01:28:11,628
"She's hot?" "She's hot."

2313
01:28:12,204 --> 01:28:13,376
I said, "Well,
you know, send me."

2314
01:28:13,455 --> 01:28:16,925
"I'll put, I'll put her on
ice for the night, you know."

2315
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,253
"Send me out, I'll make sure
everything's good for you,"

2316
01:28:19,336 --> 01:28:21,338
"you know, and you'll be
good to go next week."

2317
01:28:21,421 --> 01:28:22,923
So I did.
He went out with the girl.

2318
01:28:23,006 --> 01:28:24,053
It was smooth, right?

2319
01:28:24,132 --> 01:28:26,009
She... I think she fell in love
with him on the first date.

2320
01:28:26,092 --> 01:28:28,345
What's funny is, my brother
ended up dating this girl

2321
01:28:28,428 --> 01:28:29,850
for, like, four...
What, like three and a half years?

2322
01:28:29,930 --> 01:28:30,977
Yeah, it was like
three and a half years.

2323
01:28:31,056 --> 01:28:33,730
She never knew we switched
on the very first date.

2324
01:28:33,809 --> 01:28:35,937
She said, "The best time of
my life was the first date."

2325
01:28:36,019 --> 01:28:38,272
There you go.
I was like, "Oh, come on."

hair, full Afros.
