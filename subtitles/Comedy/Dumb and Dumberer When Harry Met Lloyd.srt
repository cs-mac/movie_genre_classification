1
00:00:43,475 --> 00:00:44,684
Excuse me.

2
00:00:45,018 --> 00:00:46,937
How do I get
to the medical school?

3
00:00:47,228 --> 00:00:50,732
I'm giving a lecture in 20 minutes
and my driver's lost.

4
00:00:52,442 --> 00:00:54,319
You go straight ahead

5
00:00:54,653 --> 00:00:57,238
and make a left over the bridge.

6
00:00:59,032 --> 00:01:01,117
That's a lovely accent you have.

7
00:01:01,409 --> 00:01:02,285
New Jersey?

8
00:01:03,703 --> 00:01:04,704
Austria.

9
00:01:04,955 --> 00:01:06,164
Austria?

10
00:01:06,665 --> 00:01:07,832
Well, then...

11
00:01:08,375 --> 00:01:09,793
'G'day, mate.'

12
00:01:11,211 --> 00:01:14,506
'Let's put another shrimp
on the barbie.'

13
00:01:15,298 --> 00:01:16,800
Let's not.

14
00:02:40,008 --> 00:02:42,844
Who's got the wiener schnitzel?

15
00:02:44,512 --> 00:02:46,014
Beautiful. There you go, Dolf.

16
00:02:46,264 --> 00:02:48,391
There you go, buddy. Enjoy

17
00:02:49,517 --> 00:02:53,396
Let's see, next we've got
roast beef au jus.

18
00:02:54,522 --> 00:02:56,816
Who's got
the roast beef au jus?

19
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:59,319
Stella, beautiful.
Bon appetit.

20
00:02:59,611 --> 00:03:02,030
Walk away, go on.
Go on.

21
00:03:02,948 --> 00:03:04,157
Last but not least:

22
00:03:04,449 --> 00:03:07,619
Footlong, who's got the Footlong?

23
00:03:09,829 --> 00:03:12,624
Very funny, Rascal.
In your dreams.

24
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:15,752
Why haven't you dropped
those dogs off at the show?

25
00:03:16,711 --> 00:03:20,548
I didn't want them to perform
on an empty stomach, sir.

26
00:03:21,007 --> 00:03:22,092
Move it!

27
00:03:22,384 --> 00:03:24,761
Yes, sir. Mutt Cutts.
Ten-four.

28
00:03:46,574 --> 00:03:48,285
Suck me sideways.

29
00:04:01,715 --> 00:04:03,591
Hello. How are you?

30
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:12,684
I'll be out in one minute.

31
00:04:42,172 --> 00:04:45,467
Why you going to the airport?
Flying somewhere?

32
00:04:46,343 --> 00:04:47,636
How'd you guess?

33
00:04:47,927 --> 00:04:49,346
I saw the ticket and luggage

34
00:04:49,721 --> 00:04:52,599
and put two and two together.

35
00:04:53,558 --> 00:04:54,684
Where to?

36
00:04:55,435 --> 00:04:56,311
Aspen.

37
00:04:57,646 --> 00:04:58,939
California!

38
00:04:59,272 --> 00:05:00,398
Beautiful.

39
00:05:03,151 --> 00:05:05,946
Name's Christmas,
Lloyd Christmas.

40
00:05:06,821 --> 00:05:08,406
I'm Mary Swanson.

41
00:05:09,491 --> 00:05:11,409
This isn't my real job.

42
00:05:11,743 --> 00:05:12,744
No?

43
00:05:12,953 --> 00:05:15,789
My pal Harry and I
are saving for a pet store.

44
00:05:16,748 --> 00:05:17,832
That's nice.

45
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:20,502
'I Got Worms.'

46
00:05:21,294 --> 00:05:22,087
I beg your pardon?

47
00:05:22,462 --> 00:05:25,256
It's the name, 'I Got Worms.'

48
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:27,467
We'll sell worm farms.

49
00:05:28,093 --> 00:05:29,678
Like ants farms.

50
00:05:31,429 --> 00:05:33,139
What's the matter?

51
00:05:33,932 --> 00:05:35,642
Tense about the flight?

52
00:05:37,185 --> 00:05:38,979
Something like that.

53
00:05:39,562 --> 00:05:41,439
Nothing to worry about.

54
00:05:41,773 --> 00:05:43,692
You're more likely to get killed...

55
00:05:43,984 --> 00:05:46,152
going to the airport, in a crash...

56
00:05:46,444 --> 00:05:49,364
flying off a cliff,
trapped under a gas truck.

57
00:05:49,656 --> 00:05:50,657
That's the worst.

58
00:05:51,074 --> 00:05:53,660
I have this cousin,
I had this cousin...

59
00:05:54,828 --> 00:05:57,330
Could you keep your eyes
on the road, please?

60
00:05:57,956 --> 00:05:59,249
Oh, yeah.

61
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:01,251
Good thinking.

62
00:06:01,584 --> 00:06:02,961
Can't be too careful.

63
00:06:03,253 --> 00:06:05,171
Lot of bad drivers out there.

64
00:06:22,355 --> 00:06:23,565
You know the rules:

65
00:06:23,773 --> 00:06:26,484
no humping, no pushing,
no sniffing hineys.

66
00:06:26,901 --> 00:06:30,614
Where were you? My dogs were
supposed to be here 40 minutes ago.

67
00:06:31,114 --> 00:06:33,116
I hardly have any time
to primp them.

68
00:06:33,408 --> 00:06:35,118
Don't worry, Mrs. 'Neugyburger'.

69
00:06:35,702 --> 00:06:37,287
- Neugeboren!
- Neu-neu-neug...

70
00:06:37,662 --> 00:06:38,455
Boren!

71
00:06:38,705 --> 00:06:41,499
The pooches won't need primping.
You know Why?

72
00:06:41,958 --> 00:06:44,461
Because I bathed
and clipped them.

73
00:06:44,753 --> 00:06:46,963
And I stand by my perfromance.

74
00:06:58,558 --> 00:07:01,353
On second thought, you might
run a comb through them.

75
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:11,655
Thanks.

76
00:07:11,988 --> 00:07:12,906
Here you go.

77
00:07:13,281 --> 00:07:14,574
Oh no, Mary.

78
00:07:15,742 --> 00:07:17,744
I couldn't possibly accept that,

79
00:07:18,036 --> 00:07:19,955
not after all we've been through.

80
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:24,876
Thank you, Lloyd.

81
00:07:25,126 --> 00:07:27,754
Good luck with your worms.

82
00:07:28,588 --> 00:07:29,506
Hey.

83
00:07:31,925 --> 00:07:33,343
How about a hug?

84
00:07:50,318 --> 00:07:52,112
I hate goodbyes.

85
00:08:03,373 --> 00:08:04,541
Just go.

86
00:08:26,813 --> 00:08:29,024
Be strong.

87
00:08:52,172 --> 00:08:54,883
She'll leave the briefcase
near the escalator.

88
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,676
You make the pick-up.

89
00:08:56,926 --> 00:08:58,219
Piece of cake.

90
00:09:07,395 --> 00:09:08,772
'Good-bye my love...'

91
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,301
There's our payday.

92
00:09:40,136 --> 00:09:42,222
She left it. Let's go.

93
00:09:43,265 --> 00:09:44,766
Coming through!

94
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,813
Move it or lose it, Sister!

95
00:09:59,531 --> 00:10:00,407
Eenie,

96
00:10:00,657 --> 00:10:01,449
meenie,

97
00:10:01,825 --> 00:10:02,659
minie,

98
00:10:03,076 --> 00:10:04,202
mo!

99
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,545
Hold that plane!

100
00:10:13,962 --> 00:10:15,839
Sir, you can't go in there!

101
00:10:16,131 --> 00:10:17,632
It's okay!

102
00:10:18,091 --> 00:10:19,926
I'm a limo driver!

103
00:10:48,955 --> 00:10:50,749
- Hi Lloyd.
- Hi, Harry.

104
00:10:52,334 --> 00:10:53,627
How was your day?

105
00:10:53,877 --> 00:10:56,254
Not bad.
Fell off the jet-way again.

106
00:11:03,136 --> 00:11:05,639
Who do you figure
this guy's working for?

107
00:11:06,598 --> 00:11:08,016
I don't know,

108
00:11:10,018 --> 00:11:12,228
but we sure as hell
better find out.

109
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:18,234
The ulcer?

110
00:11:18,568 --> 00:11:19,778
I'll live.

111
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:29,871
You got fired again?

112
00:11:30,163 --> 00:11:31,164
Oh, yeah.

113
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:35,168
They freak out when you
leave the scene of an accident.

114
00:11:37,253 --> 00:11:39,673
Yeah, well, I lost my job too.

115
00:11:40,507 --> 00:11:41,591
Man!

116
00:11:41,967 --> 00:11:44,761
You are one pathetic loser.

117
00:11:46,554 --> 00:11:47,430
No offense.

118
00:11:48,223 --> 00:11:49,432
None taken.

119
00:11:54,479 --> 00:11:56,773
You know what
really chaffs my ass?

120
00:11:57,107 --> 00:12:00,485
I spent my life savings
turning my van into a dog.

121
00:12:01,152 --> 00:12:02,279
Hi, Petey.

122
00:12:02,487 --> 00:12:03,697
The alarm alone

123
00:12:03,947 --> 00:12:04,948
cost 200.

124
00:12:05,323 --> 00:12:06,241
Chicks love it.

125
00:12:06,574 --> 00:12:07,867
It's shagging wagon.

126
00:12:09,494 --> 00:12:11,204
What's the briefcase?

127
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:16,751
It's a love momento.

128
00:12:17,002 --> 00:12:19,170
The most beautiful
woman alive.

129
00:12:19,921 --> 00:12:21,631
I drove her to the airport...

130
00:12:21,881 --> 00:12:24,718
sparks flew, emotions run high.

131
00:12:25,552 --> 00:12:27,262
She actually talked to me.

132
00:12:28,597 --> 00:12:29,472
Get out of her!

133
00:12:29,723 --> 00:12:31,016
Oh, yeah.

134
00:12:31,391 --> 00:12:32,684
Tractor beam.

135
00:12:33,602 --> 00:12:35,020
Sucked me right in.

136
00:12:35,895 --> 00:12:36,980
Anyway,

137
00:12:38,898 --> 00:12:41,026
she left this in the terminal and...

138
00:12:41,276 --> 00:12:43,278
flew to Aspen and
out of my life.

139
00:12:44,237 --> 00:12:45,405
What's in it?

140
00:12:47,782 --> 00:12:48,992
Man!

141
00:12:49,242 --> 00:12:53,038
I'm no low-life, rooting around
in someone else's private property.

142
00:12:53,413 --> 00:12:54,372
Is it locked?

143
00:12:54,623 --> 00:12:56,541
Yeah, really well.

144
00:13:05,091 --> 00:13:07,093
There's two of them,
One has a gun.

145
00:13:09,179 --> 00:13:11,264
Did you pay the gas bill?

146
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:16,478
Do you know what you've done?

147
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:18,647
I'm sorry. I say we bail.

148
00:13:19,481 --> 00:13:20,565
Okay.

149
00:13:29,574 --> 00:13:32,994
The briefcase ain't here.
He must have taken it.

150
00:13:33,745 --> 00:13:35,372
He's got to come home.

151
00:13:35,664 --> 00:13:38,541
We should trash the place,
send him a message.

152
00:13:40,543 --> 00:13:42,545
He won't get that message.

153
00:13:42,921 --> 00:13:45,340
He's got worms in his living room.

154
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:49,552
I got a better idea.

155
00:13:53,056 --> 00:13:55,058
'I thought I saw a puddy-cat.

156
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:57,727
I did. I did.'

157
00:14:08,488 --> 00:14:12,367
I can't believe we drove all day
and there are no jobs.

158
00:14:12,909 --> 00:14:15,370
- There is nothing, nada, zip.
- Yeah...

159
00:14:15,829 --> 00:14:18,415
unless you want
to work 40 hours a week.

160
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,125
Here.

161
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:21,960
I'm going to the store.

162
00:14:22,252 --> 00:14:25,046
Get the very essentials,
we got no dough.

163
00:14:26,339 --> 00:14:27,632
What do I look like?

164
00:15:15,388 --> 00:15:16,890
Little old lady?

165
00:15:23,271 --> 00:15:24,481
You got change of a dollar?

166
00:15:24,731 --> 00:15:27,359
Change? No I'm sorry.

167
00:15:29,778 --> 00:15:32,447
Could you do me a favor
and watch my stuff...

168
00:15:32,781 --> 00:15:34,199
while I go break $1?

169
00:15:34,407 --> 00:15:35,325
Of course.

170
00:15:35,617 --> 00:15:36,826
Thanks.

171
00:15:38,745 --> 00:15:39,955
Their right.

172
00:15:40,163 --> 00:15:43,458
Senior citizens, though
slow and dangerous drivers,

173
00:15:43,959 --> 00:15:46,044
can still serve a purpose.

174
00:15:46,962 --> 00:15:49,881
I'll be right back.
Don't you go dying.

175
00:15:57,097 --> 00:15:58,390
Where's the booze?

176
00:15:59,182 --> 00:16:03,186
I got robbed by a sweet old lady
on a motorized cart.

177
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,939
I didn't even see it coming.

178
00:16:11,361 --> 00:16:13,863
Come on, Harry. Cheer up.

179
00:16:14,406 --> 00:16:15,991
It get worse.

180
00:16:16,283 --> 00:16:18,076
My parakeet, Petey.

181
00:16:19,911 --> 00:16:21,288
He's dead.

182
00:16:25,834 --> 00:16:27,752
Man, I'm sorry, Harry.

183
00:16:28,044 --> 00:16:29,421
What happened?

184
00:16:30,547 --> 00:16:32,465
His head fell off!

185
00:16:32,841 --> 00:16:34,634
His head fell off?

186
00:16:34,926 --> 00:16:37,012
Yeah, he was pretty old.

187
00:16:41,808 --> 00:16:42,934
That's it.

188
00:16:43,393 --> 00:16:45,520
I've had it with this dump!

189
00:16:45,979 --> 00:16:48,690
We've got no food,
we got no jobs...

190
00:16:49,107 --> 00:16:51,026
our pets' heads are falling off!

191
00:16:51,276 --> 00:16:52,777
Okay, just a calm down.

192
00:16:53,194 --> 00:16:55,488
What the hell
are we doing here, Harry?

193
00:16:55,822 --> 00:16:57,907
We must get out of this town.

194
00:16:58,199 --> 00:17:00,076
And go where?
Where do we go?

195
00:17:00,827 --> 00:17:02,203
I'll tell you where.

196
00:17:02,996 --> 00:17:04,706
Someplace warm.

197
00:17:05,165 --> 00:17:07,792
A place where
the beer flows like wine.

198
00:17:08,209 --> 00:17:11,588
Where beautiful women flock
like the salmon of Capistrano.

199
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:17,344
I'm talking about
a little place call Aspen.

200
00:17:19,054 --> 00:17:21,473
I don't know.
The French are assholes.

201
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:23,808
Wait a minute!

202
00:17:25,936 --> 00:17:28,563
Wait, I know
what you're up to, mister.

203
00:17:29,064 --> 00:17:31,066
You just want to go to Aspen

204
00:17:31,358 --> 00:17:33,652
and find that girl
who lost her briefcase,

205
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:36,988
and you need me
to drive you there, right?

206
00:17:37,405 --> 00:17:38,323
Am I right?

207
00:17:38,657 --> 00:17:40,742
- Yeah, so?
- Am I right?

208
00:17:41,993 --> 00:17:43,995
I want to go somewhere

209
00:17:44,287 --> 00:17:46,206
we can plug
into the social pipeline.

210
00:17:46,581 --> 00:17:48,708
No, no, no, Lloyd.

211
00:17:49,209 --> 00:17:51,711
We stay here, hunt for jobs,

212
00:17:52,003 --> 00:17:54,005
and save up for the worm store.

213
00:17:55,382 --> 00:17:59,261
I am sick and tired
of running from creditors.

214
00:18:00,971 --> 00:18:03,181
You know what I'm sick
and tired of?

215
00:18:05,392 --> 00:18:08,478
I'm sick of having to eke
my way through life.

216
00:18:13,066 --> 00:18:14,985
I'm sick of being a nobody.

217
00:18:16,861 --> 00:18:18,363
But most of all,

218
00:18:23,285 --> 00:18:25,912
I'm sick and tired
of having nobody.

219
00:18:29,457 --> 00:18:30,458
Okay.

220
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:36,172
Aspen it is.

221
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:42,012
You'd better not be fooling.

222
00:18:51,146 --> 00:18:54,149
Just let it out, have a good cry.
Come on.

223
00:18:59,487 --> 00:19:01,281
Okay, that's enough.

224
00:19:39,653 --> 00:19:41,279
What are you doing?

225
00:19:41,529 --> 00:19:44,157
It feels like you're running
at an incredible rate.

226
00:19:44,491 --> 00:19:47,577
We're not through Connecticut,
and already you're annoying me.

227
00:19:47,994 --> 00:19:48,912
Sorry.

228
00:19:49,788 --> 00:19:52,165
We're really doing it,
aren't we, buddy?

229
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:55,251
Where'd you get those?

230
00:19:55,835 --> 00:19:57,629
I bought 'em
when we filled up.

231
00:19:59,547 --> 00:20:02,342
We're meant to talk
about expenditures,

232
00:20:02,842 --> 00:20:04,427
on our tight budget.

233
00:20:05,095 --> 00:20:07,097
This isn't from our travel fund.

234
00:20:08,014 --> 00:20:11,017
I raised 25 extra bucks
before we left.

235
00:20:12,394 --> 00:20:14,396
Where did you
get 25 extra bucks?

236
00:20:15,313 --> 00:20:18,024
I sold some stuff
to Billy in 4-C.

237
00:20:19,109 --> 00:20:20,610
The blind kid?

238
00:20:24,948 --> 00:20:26,658
What did you sell him?

239
00:20:28,451 --> 00:20:29,577
Stuff.

240
00:20:29,828 --> 00:20:31,496
What kind of stuff?

241
00:20:32,414 --> 00:20:33,331
I don't know...

242
00:20:33,665 --> 00:20:36,459
a few baseball cards,
a sack of marbles...

243
00:20:37,002 --> 00:20:37,919
Petey.

244
00:20:39,504 --> 00:20:40,714
Petey?

245
00:20:41,298 --> 00:20:44,509
You sold my dead bird
to a blind kid?

246
00:20:44,926 --> 00:20:47,220
That... You...
What are you...?

247
00:20:48,305 --> 00:20:50,015
Petey didn't have a head.

248
00:20:51,641 --> 00:20:53,310
I took care of it.

249
00:20:56,438 --> 00:20:59,649
Pretty bird.
Can you say 'Pretty bird'?

250
00:21:00,066 --> 00:21:01,568
Pretty bird.

251
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,945
Yes, pretty bird.

252
00:21:04,779 --> 00:21:05,947
Pretty bird.

253
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,661
Polly want a cracker?

254
00:21:15,832 --> 00:21:19,127
Those rat bastards.
They're rubbing it in our faces.

255
00:21:19,461 --> 00:21:22,839
Andre'll have a hemorrhage
if we don't get it back.

256
00:21:23,298 --> 00:21:26,509
- They must have followed us.
- Why do you say?

257
00:21:27,469 --> 00:21:28,678
'Gas Man'

258
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:31,473
How the hell do they know
I got gas?

259
00:21:31,806 --> 00:21:33,600
They gotta be pros.

260
00:21:34,809 --> 00:21:35,936
Don't worry.

261
00:21:36,144 --> 00:21:37,979
We'll get that money back.

262
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:40,774
I'll tell you something.

263
00:21:41,566 --> 00:21:44,861
They ain't never getting to Aspen.
I'll see to that.

264
00:21:51,701 --> 00:21:54,871
They got The Monkees.
The influenced The Beatles a lot.

265
00:21:55,246 --> 00:21:56,373
Yeah, I know.

266
00:21:58,959 --> 00:22:00,794
Excuse me, Flo?

267
00:22:09,636 --> 00:22:11,721
Flo, like the TV show.

268
00:22:15,058 --> 00:22:16,434
What is the soup du jour?

269
00:22:16,726 --> 00:22:18,228
It's the soup of the day.

270
00:22:19,938 --> 00:22:21,940
Sounds good.
I'll have that.

271
00:22:27,237 --> 00:22:31,032
It feels good to mingle with
these laid back country folk, eh?

272
00:22:31,866 --> 00:22:34,244
I like it a lot.

273
00:22:37,497 --> 00:22:38,623
What's wrong?

274
00:22:41,751 --> 00:22:44,671
You spilled the salt,
that's what's wrong.

275
00:22:45,547 --> 00:22:48,049
Spilling the salt
is very bad luck.

276
00:22:48,425 --> 00:22:51,928
On a drive across the country,
we don't need bad luck.

277
00:22:52,304 --> 00:22:55,390
Quick, toss some salt
over your right shoulder.

278
00:22:59,477 --> 00:23:01,271
What the hell?

279
00:23:04,274 --> 00:23:07,611
Who's the dead man that hit me
with the salt shaker?

280
00:23:21,416 --> 00:23:22,917
It was a mistake.

281
00:23:23,293 --> 00:23:26,087
I'd never do anything
to offend a man your size.

282
00:23:26,713 --> 00:23:28,298
Kick his ass, Sea Bass!

283
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:33,136
You eating that?

284
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,889
That? No. Yes.
Well...

285
00:23:36,431 --> 00:23:38,516
It crossed my mind, yeah.

286
00:23:50,153 --> 00:23:52,572
You really wimped out, man.

287
00:23:52,906 --> 00:23:56,409
What are you talking about,
'wimped out'?

288
00:23:56,743 --> 00:23:58,870
- He hawked on my burger.
- Wait.

289
00:24:00,413 --> 00:24:01,706
I think I just...

290
00:24:03,959 --> 00:24:05,168
Yeah, I had an idea.

291
00:24:09,798 --> 00:24:11,091
Follow me.

292
00:24:19,057 --> 00:24:20,558
Excuse me, guys.

293
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:22,477
What the hell do you want?

294
00:24:22,852 --> 00:24:26,064
I just want to apologize

295
00:24:26,481 --> 00:24:29,359
for that unpleasant scene
a little earlier.

296
00:24:29,693 --> 00:24:30,777
My friend Harry

297
00:24:31,069 --> 00:24:32,862
and I would...

298
00:24:33,363 --> 00:24:35,282
like to buy you guys

299
00:24:35,532 --> 00:24:37,033
a round of beers,

300
00:24:37,325 --> 00:24:39,119
just to bury the hatchet.

301
00:24:39,869 --> 00:24:41,538
Make it four 'boiler-makers'.

302
00:24:41,955 --> 00:24:43,039
Whatever you want.

303
00:24:43,373 --> 00:24:45,667
The waitress will bring it
right away.

304
00:24:48,795 --> 00:24:52,090
What are you doing?
We can't afford that.

305
00:24:56,136 --> 00:24:57,304
Excuse me?

306
00:24:58,597 --> 00:25:01,516
Sea Bass and the fellas
offered to pay our check.

307
00:25:01,933 --> 00:25:04,144
They said
just put it on their tab.

308
00:25:05,395 --> 00:25:06,980
They're very nice.

309
00:25:08,523 --> 00:25:09,941
Sea Bass said that?

310
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,110
Well if...

311
00:25:12,485 --> 00:25:14,904
that guy at the table
is Sea Bass.

312
00:25:22,996 --> 00:25:25,123
Alright, if that's what he wants.

313
00:25:26,958 --> 00:25:29,586
- Put these on there too, okay?
- You got it.

314
00:25:36,468 --> 00:25:38,553
I'll kill those sons of bitches!

315
00:25:43,975 --> 00:25:46,770
That was sheer genius.

316
00:25:47,103 --> 00:25:48,688
Where'd you get a scam like that?

317
00:25:49,105 --> 00:25:50,774
Saw it in a movie once.

318
00:25:51,066 --> 00:25:52,859
That was incredible.

319
00:25:53,568 --> 00:25:55,737
The guy tricks some sucker

320
00:25:56,071 --> 00:25:57,989
to pick up his tab and gets away?

321
00:25:58,281 --> 00:26:01,368
They catch up with him
down the road

322
00:26:01,826 --> 00:26:03,119
and slit his throat.

323
00:26:03,828 --> 00:26:05,121
It was a good one.

324
00:26:12,754 --> 00:26:16,258
This isn't the best time,
but when you can pull over,

325
00:26:16,716 --> 00:26:17,926
I gotta pee.

326
00:26:18,218 --> 00:26:20,387
Are you crazy?
I won't stop now.

327
00:26:20,804 --> 00:26:22,389
I gotta go.
What can I do?

328
00:26:22,681 --> 00:26:25,475
Whiz in one of the
empty beer bottles in the back,

329
00:26:25,809 --> 00:26:28,103
on the floor,
just get one of...

330
00:26:29,229 --> 00:26:30,730
Quit moving around!

331
00:26:37,445 --> 00:26:39,364
Watch the seat.
Watch the seat!

332
00:26:39,656 --> 00:26:40,573
Yeah!

333
00:26:52,585 --> 00:26:53,795
What's wrong?

334
00:26:54,671 --> 00:26:56,840
The bottle's full
and I'm still going.

335
00:26:57,173 --> 00:26:58,592
Stop.

336
00:26:58,967 --> 00:27:01,469
I can't once I start. It stings.

337
00:27:01,845 --> 00:27:03,346
- Quick, another bottle.
- What?

338
00:27:03,722 --> 00:27:05,640
- Come on. Hurry, hurry.
- Okay.

339
00:27:05,932 --> 00:27:06,808
Come on.

340
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:08,685
Here.

341
00:27:13,732 --> 00:27:14,649
Hold that.

342
00:27:22,532 --> 00:27:23,825
Hold that one.

343
00:27:24,993 --> 00:27:26,328
Hurry, I'm pitching it.

344
00:27:27,203 --> 00:27:28,288
What are you, a camel?

345
00:27:34,502 --> 00:27:35,295
Pull over.

346
00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:41,551
Pull over.

347
00:27:42,969 --> 00:27:45,347
No, it's a cardigan,
but thanks for noticing.

348
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:48,516
Killer boots, man.

349
00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:52,062
Pull your vehicle over
to the side of the road.

350
00:28:00,862 --> 00:28:03,365
License and registration, please.

351
00:28:07,661 --> 00:28:10,664
You were going a little fast
back there, right?

352
00:28:12,582 --> 00:28:13,583
You fellas...

353
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,127
been doing a bit of boozing?

354
00:28:16,378 --> 00:28:19,089
Sucking back on
Grandpa's old cough medicine?

355
00:28:19,422 --> 00:28:21,007
Oh, no sir.

356
00:28:22,133 --> 00:28:23,260
What's that?

357
00:28:26,513 --> 00:28:28,807
- That's nothing, sir.
- Nothing.

358
00:28:29,224 --> 00:28:32,060
You aware that it's
against the law...

359
00:28:32,352 --> 00:28:35,563
to have an open alcohol container
in Pennsylvania?

360
00:28:35,939 --> 00:28:39,734
Give me that booze,
pumpkin pie haircut freak!

361
00:28:49,577 --> 00:28:50,578
Sir, no...

362
00:28:50,912 --> 00:28:51,830
Don't drink...

363
00:28:52,038 --> 00:28:55,750
You'd shut your mouth
if you knew what was good for you.

364
00:29:12,642 --> 00:29:14,019
Tic-Tac, sir?

365
00:29:14,269 --> 00:29:15,687
Get out of here.

366
00:29:22,402 --> 00:29:24,321
Why didn't they get the ransom?

367
00:29:24,613 --> 00:29:26,489
It doesn't make sense.

368
00:29:26,781 --> 00:29:29,159
I left the money where they told me.

369
00:29:29,492 --> 00:29:32,621
It does. We should have called
the authorities...

370
00:29:33,079 --> 00:29:34,372
when Bobby was kidnapped.

371
00:29:34,706 --> 00:29:36,499
We've been through this.

372
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:38,752
Mr. Andre.

373
00:29:39,628 --> 00:29:40,503
Nicholas.

374
00:29:40,754 --> 00:29:42,255
- Karl.
- Nick.

375
00:29:43,798 --> 00:29:44,966
Any word, sir?

376
00:29:45,258 --> 00:29:47,260
Nothing yet, Nicholas.

377
00:29:49,346 --> 00:29:51,348
I've given this a lot of thought.

378
00:29:52,766 --> 00:29:56,353
Why not cancel
the Preservation benefit?

379
00:29:56,811 --> 00:29:58,730
I don't think
we should change anything.

380
00:29:59,022 --> 00:30:01,816
She's right.
We must carry on as usual.

381
00:30:02,442 --> 00:30:04,152
Especially you, Mary.

382
00:30:04,402 --> 00:30:07,405
Am I supposed to go on
like everything is fine?

383
00:30:07,781 --> 00:30:08,990
Exactly.

384
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,743
Go skiing.
Go to parties. Act normal.

385
00:30:12,035 --> 00:30:14,537
We can't let on that
anything wrong.

386
00:30:14,871 --> 00:30:17,165
If the press
or authorities suspect,

387
00:30:17,457 --> 00:30:19,376
the kidnappers may panic.

388
00:30:21,544 --> 00:30:23,546
You don't know
what they might do to him.

389
00:31:20,854 --> 00:31:23,648
He said, 'Do you love me?'
And she says, 'No...

390
00:31:23,982 --> 00:31:26,276
but that's a really
nice ski mask.'

391
00:31:33,408 --> 00:31:34,200
What's that?

392
00:34:53,775 --> 00:34:55,568
You want me to drive?

393
00:34:56,778 --> 00:34:58,196
No, I'm cool.

394
00:35:03,868 --> 00:35:07,080
These places don't do it for me.
They bring back memories.

395
00:35:07,831 --> 00:35:10,667
What happened?
Some filly break your heart?

396
00:35:11,084 --> 00:35:13,670
No, it was a girl.
Freda Felcher.

397
00:35:14,004 --> 00:35:16,298
We stayed in a place like this.

398
00:35:16,673 --> 00:35:18,800
Not this classy,
but you now, nice.

399
00:35:19,426 --> 00:35:20,594
Felcher?

400
00:35:20,885 --> 00:35:22,095
From Cranston?

401
00:35:22,345 --> 00:35:23,638
You know her?

402
00:35:24,222 --> 00:35:25,432
Yeah!

403
00:35:26,516 --> 00:35:28,393
I mean, I remember you...

404
00:35:28,685 --> 00:35:29,978
talking about her.

405
00:35:31,104 --> 00:35:33,690
We had the most incredibly
romantic time.

406
00:35:34,232 --> 00:35:36,818
I thought we'd be together
forever and then...

407
00:35:37,277 --> 00:35:40,447
about a week later,
she sends me a John Deere letter.

408
00:35:41,615 --> 00:35:43,033
She give you any reason?

409
00:35:43,325 --> 00:35:44,117
I called her,

410
00:35:44,451 --> 00:35:47,454
she said some crap about
not listening to her enough.

411
00:35:47,787 --> 00:35:51,458
I wasn't really paying attention.
But what hurt most...

412
00:35:51,958 --> 00:35:54,127
I think she was seeing
another guy.

413
00:35:57,047 --> 00:35:58,840
Never did find out who.

414
00:36:03,762 --> 00:36:05,263
Mr. Andre...

415
00:36:05,847 --> 00:36:08,224
guess who we just
happened upon?

416
00:36:10,477 --> 00:36:11,895
It ends here, in a phone booth.

417
00:36:12,187 --> 00:36:15,899
The boys are holed up in
a little love nest for the night.

418
00:36:16,566 --> 00:36:18,652
They're a little bit strange.

419
00:36:19,486 --> 00:36:21,780
What the hell
are these guys up to?

420
00:36:22,113 --> 00:36:23,907
Could they be Feds?

421
00:36:24,199 --> 00:36:26,576
Highly unlikely,
from what I've seen.

422
00:36:28,536 --> 00:36:32,332
Did you never hear of
the concept of 'other people'?

423
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:36,753
Me being that,
for the phone, sir.

424
00:36:37,837 --> 00:36:39,923
You turned your back on me.

425
00:36:40,215 --> 00:36:42,092
You got me mad.
I almost like it.

426
00:36:42,384 --> 00:36:44,469
You should've grabbed the bag!

427
00:36:44,803 --> 00:36:46,513
Here's your drink, baby.

428
00:36:47,931 --> 00:36:50,850
You don't give a damn
what I can do to you, 'cause...

429
00:36:51,893 --> 00:36:53,395
Hold on a minute.

430
00:36:55,855 --> 00:36:59,276
But that's not your problem.
You didn't know.

431
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:02,028
Get off the phone.

432
00:37:04,823 --> 00:37:06,199
Get off the phone.

433
00:37:11,496 --> 00:37:13,081
I'm sorry, you were saying?

434
00:37:13,790 --> 00:37:14,666
Look...

435
00:37:14,916 --> 00:37:17,836
Mental, they have a lot money
and its mine.

436
00:37:18,211 --> 00:37:20,505
Who are they
and why do they have it?

437
00:37:22,007 --> 00:37:24,926
I told you already, I'm on it.
Alright?

438
00:37:26,636 --> 00:37:27,637
Good.

439
00:37:32,684 --> 00:37:35,395
According to the map,
we've gone about 4 inches.

440
00:37:35,687 --> 00:37:36,980
We don't have enough...

441
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:40,358
...gas money.
- Relax. We have more than enough.

442
00:37:41,192 --> 00:37:42,402
I think you're wrong.

443
00:37:42,694 --> 00:37:44,487
How much you want to bet?

444
00:37:44,779 --> 00:37:45,864
I don't bet.

445
00:37:46,323 --> 00:37:49,326
- What do you mean?
- I don't bet. I don't gamble.

446
00:37:49,659 --> 00:37:52,829
- 'Pussy, pussy.'
- I never have and I never will.

447
00:37:53,330 --> 00:37:54,289
Right.

448
00:37:54,831 --> 00:37:57,334
20 bucks that you'll gamble
by day's end.

449
00:37:57,667 --> 00:37:59,669
- No way.
- I'll give you 3-to-1 odds.

450
00:38:00,003 --> 00:38:01,421
- Nope.
- 5-to-1?

451
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:02,756
10-to-1.

452
00:38:03,506 --> 00:38:04,507
You're on.

453
00:38:08,219 --> 00:38:09,846
I'm going to get you.

454
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:13,767
I don't know how, but I will.

455
00:38:17,896 --> 00:38:20,315
Come on.
Let me both of them.

456
00:38:20,649 --> 00:38:22,233
You don't have to worry about it.

457
00:38:22,817 --> 00:38:24,235
Just shut up.

458
00:38:24,611 --> 00:38:27,906
You don't kill people
you don't know.

459
00:38:28,323 --> 00:38:29,324
That' a rule.

460
00:38:29,908 --> 00:38:32,327
Get up here,
Lie down on the front seat.

461
00:38:32,577 --> 00:38:33,912
When they pick me up,

462
00:38:34,162 --> 00:38:36,289
you follow us.
You got that?

463
00:38:37,415 --> 00:38:38,917
Hey, here they come.

464
00:38:39,584 --> 00:38:40,794
Stay down.

465
00:38:52,514 --> 00:38:54,933
Say, are you guys
going Davenport?

466
00:38:55,558 --> 00:38:58,436
My car died
and I'm late for lunch.

467
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,983
We usually
don't pick up hitchhikers.

468
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:07,487
But I'm going with
my instinct on this one.

469
00:39:07,946 --> 00:39:09,572
Saddle up, partner.

470
00:39:12,117 --> 00:39:13,118
You're it.

471
00:39:13,785 --> 00:39:14,786
You're it.

472
00:39:15,036 --> 00:39:16,746
- You're it, quitsies.
- Anti-quitsies.

473
00:39:17,122 --> 00:39:18,748
- No anti-quitsies.
- You can't.

474
00:39:18,999 --> 00:39:20,500
- Can too!
- Cannot, stamped it!

475
00:39:20,917 --> 00:39:22,210
Can. Double. No erasies.

476
00:39:22,544 --> 00:39:25,338
Cannot. Triple stamped it.
Touch blue, make it true.

477
00:39:25,714 --> 00:39:27,591
You can't double stamp it!

478
00:39:28,008 --> 00:39:30,385
You can't triple stamp it!

479
00:39:31,428 --> 00:39:32,304
Guys!

480
00:39:32,554 --> 00:39:33,763
Enough!

481
00:39:39,561 --> 00:39:41,855
Want to hear the most
annoying sound in the world?

482
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,485
Guys! Guys! Guys!

483
00:39:50,196 --> 00:39:51,114
Fellas...

484
00:39:52,991 --> 00:39:55,994
Could we listen to
the radio or something?

485
00:39:57,787 --> 00:39:59,080
Radio?

486
00:39:59,873 --> 00:40:02,292
Who needs a radio?
Ready, Harry?

487
00:40:04,169 --> 00:40:05,462
Mock...

488
00:40:06,212 --> 00:40:07,213
ing...

489
00:40:08,214 --> 00:40:09,299
bird.

490
00:40:12,469 --> 00:40:13,887
Mockingbird.

491
00:40:14,721 --> 00:40:16,723
Everybody have you heard?

492
00:40:17,182 --> 00:40:20,977
She's going to buy me
a mockingbird.

493
00:40:21,353 --> 00:40:24,773
And if that mockingbird
don't sing,

494
00:40:25,231 --> 00:40:28,443
she's going to buy me
a diamond ring.

495
00:40:32,322 --> 00:40:34,324
Some people want a ride, too!

496
00:40:34,699 --> 00:40:36,409
Pick them up.

497
00:40:57,555 --> 00:41:00,141
You want an Atomic Pepper,
Mr. Mentalino?

498
00:41:03,353 --> 00:41:04,854
No, you guys go ahead.

499
00:41:05,355 --> 00:41:07,065
I'll do it if you will.

500
00:41:07,315 --> 00:41:09,150
Okay, you go first.

501
00:41:09,401 --> 00:41:11,528
- No, you go first.
- No, you go first.

502
00:41:11,861 --> 00:41:13,154
- You.
- You.

503
00:41:13,488 --> 00:41:14,990
I always go first.

504
00:41:15,282 --> 00:41:17,367
Why don't you guys

505
00:41:17,659 --> 00:41:20,370
stop acting like pussies

506
00:41:20,662 --> 00:41:22,163
and go at the same time?

507
00:41:24,332 --> 00:41:27,043
- That sounds like a dare.
- It's a double dare.

508
00:41:27,377 --> 00:41:29,087
Okay, you're on.

509
00:41:37,971 --> 00:41:39,472
It's not so bad.

510
00:41:40,181 --> 00:41:42,058
It's more tingly than hot.

511
00:41:55,655 --> 00:41:58,950
If you fellas would excuse me
I got to use the phone.

512
00:41:59,784 --> 00:42:01,703
Enjoy your meal, guys.

513
00:42:04,289 --> 00:42:06,374
Here, Lloyd. This helps.

514
00:42:08,251 --> 00:42:09,836
It works good.

515
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:18,178
Yeah, it's Mental.

516
00:42:18,970 --> 00:42:21,640
I'm sitting down
to a nice meal with our boys.

517
00:42:21,973 --> 00:42:25,101
Don't forget, your bread plate
is on the left.

518
00:42:25,435 --> 00:42:28,063
I can't have them
running around Aspen.

519
00:42:28,355 --> 00:42:29,481
Don't worry.

520
00:42:29,814 --> 00:42:32,400
They won't be once I dump
some rat poison

521
00:42:32,734 --> 00:42:34,444
in their drinks.

522
00:42:41,826 --> 00:42:43,995
- That's good.
- Here he comes.

523
00:42:46,081 --> 00:42:50,001
- Feeling better, girls?
- Much better. Thanks for asking.

524
00:42:56,925 --> 00:42:59,135
Why are you going to Aspen?
Vacation?

525
00:43:00,553 --> 00:43:02,555
Eat up and we'll tell you.

526
00:43:04,015 --> 00:43:06,518
It doesn't seem like
you packed much.

527
00:43:06,935 --> 00:43:09,521
All I saw was one bag
and a briefcase.

528
00:43:10,397 --> 00:43:13,566
The briefcase isn't ours.
A lady left it at the airport.

529
00:43:14,025 --> 00:43:16,903
We're taking it back to her.
How's your burger?

530
00:43:19,364 --> 00:43:21,658
You don't even know her?

531
00:43:30,625 --> 00:43:31,835
Talk about

532
00:43:32,168 --> 00:43:34,879
being in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

533
00:44:05,744 --> 00:44:08,038
Are you okay, man.
It was just a goof!

534
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:10,665
My ulcer. Quick...

535
00:44:10,957 --> 00:44:12,751
my pills!

536
00:44:13,043 --> 00:44:14,711
We should call an ambulance.

537
00:44:15,128 --> 00:44:18,131
You get the pills.
Don't worry, I know CPR.

538
00:44:18,423 --> 00:44:19,925
I'll get the pills.

539
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:21,635
Bad air out, good air in.

540
00:44:22,010 --> 00:44:23,720
Out with the bad air...

541
00:44:36,608 --> 00:44:38,985
This is easier
if you just lay back.

542
00:44:40,070 --> 00:44:40,654
Here.

543
00:44:40,862 --> 00:44:42,447
He's resisting me.

544
00:44:43,698 --> 00:44:44,991
There you go.
Pills.

545
00:44:47,243 --> 00:44:50,664
- Pills are good.
- Drink them down. There you go.

546
00:44:52,749 --> 00:44:54,542
- There you go, big guy.
- That's better.

547
00:44:54,834 --> 00:44:57,754
Want some ketchup and mustard?
That helped us.

548
00:45:01,424 --> 00:45:02,842
You son of a...

549
00:45:03,510 --> 00:45:04,594
bitch!

550
00:45:14,688 --> 00:45:16,189
Check, please.

551
00:45:19,985 --> 00:45:21,569
I can't believe it.

552
00:45:22,821 --> 00:45:24,698
Life's a fragile thing.

553
00:45:25,198 --> 00:45:28,702
One minute you're chewing on
a burger, then you're dead meat.

554
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:30,745
But he blamed me.

555
00:45:31,121 --> 00:45:33,248
You heard his last words.

556
00:45:34,666 --> 00:45:36,751
Not if you count
the gurgling sound.

557
00:45:41,464 --> 00:45:42,674
He was poisoned?

558
00:45:42,882 --> 00:45:44,217
No doubt about it.

559
00:45:44,467 --> 00:45:46,469
We found these next to him.

560
00:45:47,596 --> 00:45:48,805
Sir...

561
00:45:49,389 --> 00:45:52,100
waitress says he came in
with two young guys.

562
00:45:52,434 --> 00:45:55,020
They called the ambulance
and then they left.

563
00:45:55,437 --> 00:45:56,521
You know where?

564
00:45:56,896 --> 00:46:00,775
Report says they were seen
headed west toward Colorado.

565
00:46:01,610 --> 00:46:02,902
Vehicle's description?

566
00:46:04,904 --> 00:46:06,323
Yes, sir.

567
00:46:06,615 --> 00:46:08,992
They're driving an '84...

568
00:46:10,035 --> 00:46:11,036
sheepdog.

569
00:47:08,927 --> 00:47:10,345
Skis, huh?

570
00:47:11,346 --> 00:47:13,348
- That's right.
- Great.

571
00:47:14,474 --> 00:47:15,850
They yours?

572
00:47:22,190 --> 00:47:23,275
Both of them?

573
00:47:28,738 --> 00:47:30,448
Cool.

574
00:47:34,369 --> 00:47:37,581
Excuse me, but you're
spraying everywhere.

575
00:48:32,010 --> 00:48:34,220
A lot of luggage
for a little vacation.

576
00:48:34,554 --> 00:48:35,764
I'm moving to Aspen.

577
00:48:35,972 --> 00:48:39,184
To get away from my boyfriend.
He's such a klutz.

578
00:48:39,559 --> 00:48:43,146
My astrologer told me to stay away
from accident prone guys.

579
00:48:44,439 --> 00:48:46,024
You know, I...

580
00:48:49,527 --> 00:48:52,238
Here, that's a little loose.
Might want to...

581
00:48:52,656 --> 00:48:55,575
- Thank you.
- No, allow me. I've got...

582
00:48:56,034 --> 00:48:58,912
a thing here,
got them right here.

583
00:49:06,336 --> 00:49:07,337
Thank you.

584
00:49:07,671 --> 00:49:10,882
Sure. You know, I'm heading up
to Aspen myself.

585
00:49:11,258 --> 00:49:14,344
We could meet
and have hot chocolate.

586
00:49:16,012 --> 00:49:18,306
Sure, why not.
You seem harmless.

587
00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:21,851
- I'll give you my number. A pen?
- Great.

588
00:49:22,310 --> 00:49:24,312
I know I have one in here.

589
00:49:25,438 --> 00:49:27,941
Tell it to me.
I've got a really good memory.

590
00:49:28,233 --> 00:49:29,818
The number's 555...

591
00:49:30,193 --> 00:49:31,111
90...

592
00:49:31,486 --> 00:49:33,405
Wait, that's my old number.

593
00:49:33,655 --> 00:49:35,865
Weird how your mind goes blank.

594
00:49:36,241 --> 00:49:38,451
Give me the damn number!

595
00:49:39,369 --> 00:49:42,372
Look, if you're going to
get pushy, forget about it.

596
00:49:49,379 --> 00:49:51,506
Find a happy place.

597
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:54,134
Find a happy place.

598
00:50:41,973 --> 00:50:44,476
- Any sign?
- No, but we expect them shortly.

599
00:50:44,809 --> 00:50:47,687
A motorist saw a pooch 30
miles back headed this way.

600
00:50:53,443 --> 00:50:55,820
I told you what happened,
so drop it.

601
00:50:56,154 --> 00:50:58,156
Okay, sure thing.
Sure thing.

602
00:50:58,531 --> 00:51:00,742
Look, we're almost in Colorado.

603
00:51:01,159 --> 00:51:04,955
Let's change seats.
I've been driving for 9 hours.

604
00:51:05,330 --> 00:51:07,624
I don't have the energy
to start a new state.

605
00:51:09,876 --> 00:51:11,002
Hey, guys.

606
00:51:11,294 --> 00:51:13,672
Big Gulps, huh?
Alright!

607
00:51:14,506 --> 00:51:16,091
Well, see you later.

608
00:51:20,095 --> 00:51:22,389
Hey, Harry,
I got some beef jerky...

609
00:51:27,394 --> 00:51:30,397
Some people weren't cut out
for life on the road.

610
00:52:06,182 --> 00:52:08,685
I was wondering when
you'd get up.

611
00:52:11,187 --> 00:52:13,481
How long have I been out?

612
00:52:15,150 --> 00:52:17,652
I'd say a good 5 hours.

613
00:52:23,742 --> 00:52:27,245
I expected the Rocky Mountains
to be rockier.

614
00:52:29,247 --> 00:52:31,249
I was thinking the same thing.

615
00:52:31,625 --> 00:52:34,711
That John Denver is full of shit.

616
00:52:39,341 --> 00:52:41,176
I'm only human.

617
00:52:41,927 --> 00:52:44,262
Anybody can make a mistake.

618
00:52:44,971 --> 00:52:46,181
Come on!

619
00:52:46,473 --> 00:52:48,266
Stop being a baby.

620
00:52:48,516 --> 00:52:50,435
So we backtracked a tad.

621
00:52:50,727 --> 00:52:51,937
'A tad'?

622
00:52:53,104 --> 00:52:54,606
'A tad', Lloyd?

623
00:52:54,898 --> 00:52:58,568
You drove almost a sixth
of the way across the country...

624
00:52:58,944 --> 00:53:01,363
in the wrong direction!

625
00:53:02,822 --> 00:53:06,701
We don't have enough money
to get to Aspen, to get home,

626
00:53:07,202 --> 00:53:11,081
to eat, or to sleep!

627
00:53:14,376 --> 00:53:17,587
It won't do us any good
to sit whining about it.

628
00:53:17,963 --> 00:53:19,547
We're in a hole.

629
00:53:19,839 --> 00:53:22,550
We're going to have to
dig ourselves out.

630
00:53:24,511 --> 00:53:27,389
Okay. You're right.
You're absolutely right.

631
00:53:27,722 --> 00:53:28,807
Where you going?

632
00:53:30,141 --> 00:53:32,560
Home. I'm walking home.

633
00:53:35,647 --> 00:53:37,941
Well, pardon me, Mr. Perfect.

634
00:53:38,566 --> 00:53:42,070
I guess I forgot
you never make a mistake.

635
00:54:30,410 --> 00:54:33,121
Got one more place
if you still want to go to Aspen.

636
00:54:33,830 --> 00:54:35,332
Where did you find that?

637
00:54:36,541 --> 00:54:38,376
Some kid back in town.

638
00:54:38,835 --> 00:54:40,754
Traded the van for it.
Straight up.

639
00:54:41,254 --> 00:54:44,049
I can get 70 miles to the gallon
on this little hog.

640
00:54:49,179 --> 00:54:50,472
You know Lloyd,

641
00:54:51,056 --> 00:54:55,060
just when I think
you couldn't be any dumber,

642
00:54:56,603 --> 00:54:58,897
you go and do
something like this,

643
00:55:00,774 --> 00:55:03,360
and totally redeem yourself.

644
00:55:06,696 --> 00:55:08,907
- Still want to go to Aspen?
- Oh, yeah!

645
00:55:09,199 --> 00:55:11,576
Okay. Let's go, buddy.

646
00:55:16,081 --> 00:55:18,875
- No, west. Go west.
- Oh, yeah.

647
00:56:05,088 --> 00:56:08,383
I got to stop
to go to the bathroom.

648
00:56:10,010 --> 00:56:11,678
Just go, man.

649
00:56:17,100 --> 00:56:18,685
That sure is warm.

650
00:57:20,372 --> 00:57:21,873
We're there.

651
00:57:31,633 --> 00:57:34,844
Got a little nippy
going through the pass.

652
00:57:38,390 --> 00:57:40,100
Isn't this incredible?

653
00:57:40,475 --> 00:57:43,687
- What more could 2 single guys want?
- Some food?

654
00:57:44,229 --> 00:57:47,440
I swallowed a June bug driving.
I'm not that hungry.

655
00:57:47,816 --> 00:57:49,192
Well, I'm starving.

656
00:57:49,985 --> 00:57:52,696
Jeez, look at the butt on that.

657
00:57:53,697 --> 00:57:54,906
Yeah.

658
00:57:55,407 --> 00:57:57,075
He must work out.

659
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:01,371
Let's deliver the briefcase.

660
00:58:01,663 --> 00:58:05,542
If I know her like I think,
she'll give us tea and strumpets.

661
00:58:05,917 --> 00:58:07,419
Where does she live?

662
00:58:07,794 --> 00:58:09,004
I don't know.

663
00:58:10,505 --> 00:58:12,507
What's her last name?
I'll look it up.

664
00:58:15,635 --> 00:58:18,013
I don't really recall.

665
00:58:18,471 --> 00:58:19,764
It starts with an 's'.

666
00:58:20,098 --> 00:58:22,976
Swim, Swami, Slippy,

667
00:58:23,476 --> 00:58:25,770
Slappy, Slimin, Solmon,

668
00:58:26,062 --> 00:58:28,148
Simin, Sal, Swenson, Swanson...

669
00:58:28,857 --> 00:58:31,568
- Maybe it's on the briefcase.
- Right here.

670
00:58:31,901 --> 00:58:33,278
'Samsonite'!

671
00:58:33,570 --> 00:58:36,281
I was way off.
I knew it started with an 's'.

672
00:58:37,866 --> 00:58:39,826
I'm not seeing it here.

673
00:58:40,243 --> 00:58:41,828
She must be unlisted.

674
00:58:45,457 --> 00:58:46,458
Great.

675
00:58:47,042 --> 00:58:49,002
What are we supposed to do now?

676
00:58:53,757 --> 00:58:56,551
I can't feel
my fingers anymore, Lloyd.

677
00:58:56,885 --> 00:58:59,304
They're, they're, they're numb.

678
00:59:02,641 --> 00:59:05,060
You should wear
these extra gloves.

679
00:59:05,560 --> 00:59:07,687
My hands are
starting to get sweaty.

680
00:59:08,688 --> 00:59:10,315
Extra gloves?

681
00:59:11,733 --> 00:59:13,526
You had this pair...

682
00:59:13,818 --> 00:59:15,987
of extra gloves the whole time?

683
00:59:17,781 --> 00:59:20,283
Yeah. We're in the Rockies.

684
00:59:22,869 --> 00:59:24,287
I'm going to kill you.

685
00:59:25,622 --> 00:59:26,498
What?

686
00:59:27,249 --> 00:59:28,333
I'm going to kill you.

687
00:59:28,917 --> 00:59:30,543
I'm going to kill you, Lloyd.

688
00:59:30,835 --> 00:59:32,921
- Calm down.
- Right now, I'll kill you.

689
00:59:33,213 --> 00:59:35,298
You got that crazy look
in your eye.

690
00:59:40,095 --> 00:59:41,888
- I know what to do.
- What are you doing?

691
00:59:42,264 --> 00:59:45,475
Something I should have done
a long time ago.

692
00:59:47,269 --> 00:59:48,561
Don't do anything foolish.

693
00:59:48,979 --> 00:59:51,147
What foolish?
This ain't foolish.

694
00:59:51,439 --> 00:59:53,733
I'm going to throw this curse

695
00:59:54,067 --> 00:59:55,694
right into that damn pond.

696
00:59:58,446 --> 01:00:00,323
- I'm gonna do it!
- You're an asshole.

697
01:00:07,330 --> 01:00:09,624
Your hands are freezing.

698
01:00:13,587 --> 01:00:14,588
Look!

699
01:00:15,964 --> 01:00:16,840
Look!

700
01:00:22,762 --> 01:00:23,638
Okay.

701
01:00:23,972 --> 01:00:25,181
Here's the plan.

702
01:00:25,432 --> 01:00:28,226
We borrow a few bucks,
a small loan from the briefcase...

703
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:30,770
- And we find reasonable lodgings.
- Good.

704
01:00:31,062 --> 01:00:33,356
We write IOUs for all we spend.

705
01:00:33,648 --> 01:00:36,776
Every last penny.
What we borrow, we pay back.

706
01:00:37,110 --> 01:00:39,821
- We're good for it.
- Our word is our bond.

707
01:00:42,532 --> 01:00:45,744
This is the Hotel Danbury
Presidential Suite, gentlemen,

708
01:00:46,119 --> 01:00:48,121
normally reserved for royalty,

709
01:00:48,371 --> 01:00:49,706
visiting dignitaries,

710
01:00:49,915 --> 01:00:52,125
stars of stage and screen.

711
01:00:52,459 --> 01:00:55,337
Coming shortly are
the Emperor and Empress ofJapan.

712
01:00:55,670 --> 01:00:57,172
Prince Charles and Di,

713
01:00:57,547 --> 01:01:00,467
when they were together,
came constantly.

714
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:02,302
We'll take it.

715
01:01:31,998 --> 01:01:33,083
There you go.

716
01:01:36,044 --> 01:01:37,254
There you go.

717
01:01:37,504 --> 01:01:38,797
There you go.

718
01:01:39,089 --> 01:01:40,257
There you go.

719
01:01:41,049 --> 01:01:42,342
There you go.

720
01:01:49,599 --> 01:01:52,394
- The rain brought him.
- Her name was Sarah.

721
01:01:53,561 --> 01:01:57,357
Though at the time, he wasn't sure
he wanted to accept the gift.

722
01:01:57,732 --> 01:02:00,110
Ned, you think he'll let us stay?

723
01:02:03,113 --> 01:02:05,740
You and me, we're a family.

724
01:02:08,034 --> 01:02:10,453
And no one will ever
break us apart.

725
01:02:14,749 --> 01:02:15,542
Boy!

726
01:02:15,792 --> 01:02:17,377
- This is living, huh?
- Yeah.

727
01:02:17,627 --> 01:02:18,920
What's on next?

728
01:02:19,379 --> 01:02:21,881
I don't know. Let's see.

729
01:02:24,217 --> 01:02:25,594
Lloyd, you okay?

730
01:02:27,429 --> 01:02:28,346
It's Mary.

731
01:02:29,431 --> 01:02:30,307
Who?

732
01:02:30,557 --> 01:02:32,267
Mary. With the briefcase?

733
01:02:32,559 --> 01:02:35,520
'Mary Swanson'.

734
01:02:36,396 --> 01:02:37,814
Swanson!

735
01:02:38,189 --> 01:02:40,483
Will hawst a newl...

736
01:02:40,775 --> 01:02:42,485
'Host.' 'Annual.'

737
01:02:42,777 --> 01:02:46,364
'Host an annual meeting of...'

738
01:02:50,994 --> 01:02:51,912
'the...'

739
01:02:52,120 --> 01:02:54,247
'The Intern...'

740
01:02:54,539 --> 01:02:55,457
Big one.

741
01:02:55,707 --> 01:02:58,501
'International Preservation
Society tomorrow night.'

742
01:03:01,755 --> 01:03:05,133
Come on Cinderella, we gotta
get you ready for the ball.

743
01:04:58,622 --> 01:05:01,625
- Thanks, Barn. There you go.
- Thank you, sir.

744
01:05:21,186 --> 01:05:22,646
Cripes!

745
01:05:30,946 --> 01:05:32,030
Time out!

746
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:33,698
Time out. Whatever.

747
01:05:34,074 --> 01:05:35,367
Excuse me, gentlemen.

748
01:05:35,742 --> 01:05:38,536
It's a $500 dollar-a-plate dinner.
Good night.

749
01:05:38,870 --> 01:05:42,582
500, alright, no problem.
Put us down for...

750
01:05:42,958 --> 01:05:45,752
- Put us down for four.
- In case we want seconds.

751
01:05:52,425 --> 01:05:53,718
Jesus Christ!

752
01:05:54,094 --> 01:05:56,012
- It's them.
- Them who?

753
01:05:56,304 --> 01:05:58,598
Them! The guys who
whacked Mental.

754
01:06:01,184 --> 01:06:02,477
Can't you just feel it.

755
01:06:02,852 --> 01:06:04,938
This our big chance, man.

756
01:06:05,355 --> 01:06:08,358
With a little class,
a little sophistication,

757
01:06:08,692 --> 01:06:11,695
...we're in like a dirty shirt.
- We can be classy.

758
01:06:12,028 --> 01:06:14,197
Look at the funbags
on that hosehound!

759
01:06:14,531 --> 01:06:18,451
I'd eat her liver with fava beans
and a nice bottle of Chianti.

760
01:06:22,372 --> 01:06:25,083
Let's go get some
loudmouth soup.

761
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:30,005
Bartender,
two martinis, please.

762
01:06:31,464 --> 01:06:33,425
Can I have your attention, please.

763
01:06:33,717 --> 01:06:37,512
The Aspen Preservation Society
is the world's foremost...

764
01:06:37,887 --> 01:06:40,599
defender of 23 endangered species.

765
01:06:40,932 --> 01:06:42,934
It is with tremendous honor

766
01:06:43,184 --> 01:06:45,895
that we bring
Mr. Swanson forward to

767
01:06:46,229 --> 01:06:48,315
introduce us to the 24th.

768
01:06:48,773 --> 01:06:49,733
Karl.

769
01:06:54,571 --> 01:06:55,572
Thank you.

770
01:06:56,156 --> 01:06:58,241
Ladies and gentlemen,

771
01:06:58,617 --> 01:07:01,328
I give you the Icelandic Snow Owl.

772
01:07:09,586 --> 01:07:12,589
These magnificent specimens
constitute one seventh...

773
01:07:12,923 --> 01:07:15,425
of the Snow Owl population
left on the planet.

774
01:07:15,842 --> 01:07:17,218
And God willing,

775
01:07:17,510 --> 01:07:20,305
with your help
and that of the Society,

776
01:07:20,639 --> 01:07:23,767
these wonderful creatures
will flourish again.

777
01:07:24,059 --> 01:07:26,686
Thank you. Enjoy your evening.

778
01:07:29,481 --> 01:07:31,483
Could I have some pistachios?

779
01:07:33,777 --> 01:07:35,195
And another one of those.

780
01:07:35,445 --> 01:07:39,324
What are you doing? Calm down.
I've never seen you so nervous.

781
01:07:40,784 --> 01:07:42,494
Keep an eye on them, Shay.

782
01:07:42,953 --> 01:07:44,246
A close eye.

783
01:07:44,496 --> 01:07:46,206
I'm ready for commitment.

784
01:07:46,498 --> 01:07:49,084
First time I set eyes
on Mary Swanson,

785
01:07:49,626 --> 01:07:52,420
I got that old-fashioned
romantic feeling,

786
01:07:53,171 --> 01:07:55,298
where I'd do anything
to bone her.

787
01:07:55,757 --> 01:07:57,968
That's a special feeling, Lloyd.

788
01:08:00,011 --> 01:08:01,221
Oh, my!

789
01:08:01,721 --> 01:08:02,722
There she is.

790
01:08:02,973 --> 01:08:04,975
Wow! You weren't kidding.

791
01:08:05,475 --> 01:08:06,893
She's an angel.

792
01:08:09,187 --> 01:08:11,690
What are you waiting for?
Go talk to her.

793
01:08:17,570 --> 01:08:21,283
She'll think I'm psycho when she
finds out how far I came.

794
01:08:21,741 --> 01:08:23,159
You know what you have?

795
01:08:23,410 --> 01:08:25,870
Her briefcase. She'll be thrilled.

796
01:08:27,914 --> 01:08:28,707
Wait!

797
01:08:28,957 --> 01:08:30,125
I have an idea.

798
01:08:31,626 --> 01:08:35,505
Why don't you go over,
introduce yourself,

799
01:08:35,922 --> 01:08:39,843
and build me up so I won't
have to brag about myself later.

800
01:08:40,218 --> 01:08:43,013
Tell her I'm rich,
I'm good looking...

801
01:08:43,430 --> 01:08:44,306
and...

802
01:08:44,556 --> 01:08:46,182
I have a rapist wit.

803
01:08:46,433 --> 01:08:48,852
No, I don't think I could.

804
01:08:49,185 --> 01:08:51,563
- I'm not. No.
- Come on. Please.

805
01:08:53,148 --> 01:08:54,024
Stop.

806
01:08:54,274 --> 01:08:55,692
What are you going to do?

807
01:08:56,276 --> 01:08:57,861
I'm going to hang by the bar.

808
01:08:58,737 --> 01:09:00,363
Put out the vibe.

809
01:09:13,043 --> 01:09:15,045
Nice set of hooters you got.

810
01:09:17,088 --> 01:09:18,089
I beg your pardon?

811
01:09:18,673 --> 01:09:20,300
The owls, they're beautiful.

812
01:09:26,598 --> 01:09:28,058
Are you a bird lover?

813
01:09:28,475 --> 01:09:31,353
Me? Oh, no.
I used to have a parakeet,

814
01:09:31,686 --> 01:09:35,482
but now my main area
of expertise is canines.

815
01:09:35,982 --> 01:09:36,983
'Dogs',

816
01:09:37,317 --> 01:09:38,818
to the layperson.

817
01:09:39,819 --> 01:09:41,112
Thanks.

818
01:09:42,864 --> 01:09:44,532
I love dogs, too.

819
01:09:45,575 --> 01:09:48,870
- How are you involved with them?
- I've trained them.

820
01:09:49,246 --> 01:09:51,831
Bathed them, clipped them.
I've even bred them.

821
01:09:52,123 --> 01:09:54,125
Really? Any unusual breeding?

822
01:09:54,459 --> 01:09:56,044
No, mostly just doggie-style.

823
01:09:57,379 --> 01:09:58,171
Once,

824
01:09:58,713 --> 01:10:01,716
we successfully mated
a bulldog with a shitzu.

825
01:10:02,676 --> 01:10:03,677
Really?

826
01:10:04,469 --> 01:10:05,553
That's weird.

827
01:10:06,221 --> 01:10:08,723
Yeah, we called it a 'bullshit'.

828
01:10:20,068 --> 01:10:21,569
Anyway, the real reason

829
01:10:21,861 --> 01:10:23,363
I came over here...

830
01:10:23,613 --> 01:10:26,408
was to introduce you
to a buddy of mine.

831
01:10:27,075 --> 01:10:29,995
Mary, I don't believe
I've met your friend.

832
01:10:30,495 --> 01:10:32,789
We haven't been
properly introduced.

833
01:10:33,123 --> 01:10:35,417
- My name's Mary Swanson.
- Harry Dunne.

834
01:10:36,459 --> 01:10:38,545
Nice to meet you.
My stepmother Helen.

835
01:10:38,920 --> 01:10:41,131
Harry Dunne.
Pleasure to meet you both.

836
01:10:42,299 --> 01:10:44,801
I was hoping I'd get
a chance to meet you.

837
01:10:45,218 --> 01:10:46,928
Oh, you were? Really?

838
01:10:47,304 --> 01:10:49,598
That tuxedo. It's fabulous!

839
01:10:50,015 --> 01:10:52,309
I love a man with
a sense of humor.

840
01:10:52,726 --> 01:10:55,020
And so does Mary.
It's hysterical.

841
01:10:55,312 --> 01:10:56,896
- Really?
- Oh, yes.

842
01:10:59,065 --> 01:11:02,068
- About my friend...
- What are you doing tomorrow?

843
01:11:02,402 --> 01:11:04,779
Mary needs someone
to hit the slopes with.

844
01:11:05,113 --> 01:11:06,615
She what?

845
01:11:08,700 --> 01:11:10,994
- You're embarrassing me.
- Yeah, well you do.

846
01:11:11,286 --> 01:11:14,372
The snow'll be gone
in a couple of weeks.

847
01:11:14,748 --> 01:11:17,751
This may be your last chance.
She never goes out.

848
01:11:18,168 --> 01:11:20,670
Well, Mr. Dunne.
Are you available?

849
01:11:21,296 --> 01:11:24,174
- My friend...
- Forget your friend for one day.

850
01:11:24,716 --> 01:11:27,302
You'll have a wonderful time.
What do you say?

851
01:11:28,178 --> 01:11:31,765
I don't know.
The thing is...

852
01:11:32,265 --> 01:11:33,642
Sure. What time?

853
01:11:39,230 --> 01:11:40,941
How come you didn't
bring her over?

854
01:11:42,359 --> 01:11:45,654
Relax, you're golden.
I got you a date with her tomorrow.

855
01:11:47,656 --> 01:11:50,283
What?
I can't...

856
01:11:50,617 --> 01:11:51,701
I love you, man.

857
01:11:51,952 --> 01:11:54,454
Okay, you're kissing me.

858
01:11:54,871 --> 01:11:56,581
You're kissing me.

859
01:11:59,251 --> 01:12:01,628
This calls for
a little of the bubbly.

860
01:12:02,462 --> 01:12:04,047
- You're gonna be my best man.
- Oh, good.

861
01:12:04,464 --> 01:12:05,340
I promise.

862
01:12:05,590 --> 01:12:09,469
You just earned yourself
a seat at the head of the table.

863
01:12:10,011 --> 01:12:11,596
We already got the tuxes.

864
01:12:23,024 --> 01:12:25,151
Boy, this party really died.

865
01:12:31,783 --> 01:12:33,285
Maybe it was a coincidence.

866
01:12:34,911 --> 01:12:37,080
'Maybe it was a coincidence.'

867
01:12:37,831 --> 01:12:40,709
It was a message, Shay,
pure and simple.

868
01:12:41,126 --> 01:12:45,130
We killed their bird,
now they killed one of ours.

869
01:12:47,841 --> 01:12:50,343
How can anybody
whack a bird with a cork?

870
01:12:50,677 --> 01:12:53,054
These guys aren't just anybody.

871
01:12:53,346 --> 01:12:54,556
They're good.

872
01:13:11,698 --> 01:13:12,782
Coming!

873
01:13:17,829 --> 01:13:19,664
Nice going, buddy.

874
01:13:35,889 --> 01:13:37,015
Ma'am.

875
01:13:41,227 --> 01:13:43,188
Beautiful outfit, sir.

876
01:13:45,357 --> 01:13:46,566
There you go.

877
01:13:58,620 --> 01:13:59,704
How you doin'?

878
01:13:59,996 --> 01:14:02,499
You're early.
We don't open for 45 minutes.

879
01:14:04,584 --> 01:14:06,378
I'm meeting someone here.

880
01:14:07,504 --> 01:14:08,880
Mind if I wait at the bar?

881
01:14:09,172 --> 01:14:10,257
No. Come on in.

882
01:14:13,927 --> 01:14:15,637
It's a beautiful day, huh?

883
01:14:15,929 --> 01:14:19,140
Yes, I've had a wonderful time
so far, thank you.

884
01:14:20,225 --> 01:14:22,936
God, it feels so good
to get up here.

885
01:14:23,353 --> 01:14:25,939
I haven't been outside much lately.

886
01:14:26,231 --> 01:14:27,524
Oh, yeah?
Why not?

887
01:14:29,609 --> 01:14:30,610
There's been some...

888
01:14:31,236 --> 01:14:32,571
family problems.

889
01:14:32,946 --> 01:14:35,031
I don't want to
bore you with those.

890
01:14:35,323 --> 01:14:36,324
Thanks.

891
01:14:38,159 --> 01:14:39,661
Oh, look. Frost.

892
01:14:48,920 --> 01:14:50,088
Are you okay?

893
01:14:50,463 --> 01:14:53,049
I do this all the time.

894
01:15:07,564 --> 01:15:08,940
Hi there.

895
01:15:10,483 --> 01:15:11,776
Say, kids...

896
01:15:12,861 --> 01:15:15,947
You don't have
a cup of warm water, do you?

897
01:15:23,163 --> 01:15:24,289
Excuse me.

898
01:15:25,498 --> 01:15:27,083
Is it 10 AM yet?

899
01:15:29,210 --> 01:15:30,045
It's 1.00.

900
01:15:33,006 --> 01:15:34,382
That's what I have too.

901
01:15:35,091 --> 01:15:36,676
I thought maybe it was fast.

902
01:15:40,847 --> 01:15:41,848
She's late?

903
01:15:42,557 --> 01:15:44,267
Just a couple of hours.

904
01:15:44,809 --> 01:15:45,977
You know girls.

905
01:15:46,353 --> 01:15:48,438
When they're excited
about something,

906
01:15:49,064 --> 01:15:51,149
everything has to be perfect.

907
01:15:59,366 --> 01:16:00,367
This one is on me.

908
01:16:02,911 --> 01:16:03,912
Yippie.

909
01:16:05,622 --> 01:16:07,123
Chablis, please.

910
01:16:08,458 --> 01:16:09,376
Hello.

911
01:16:16,591 --> 01:16:17,801
Bad day, huh?

912
01:16:19,594 --> 01:16:20,804
Me too.

913
01:16:21,805 --> 01:16:25,100
It's been bad since
I broke up with my boyfriend.

914
01:16:44,411 --> 01:16:46,830
My God! You poor guy.
Does it hurt?

915
01:16:47,247 --> 01:16:50,333
Oh, no. I'm fine.
I saved a seat for you.

916
01:16:51,001 --> 01:16:53,628
Oh, no. This is silly.
Let me help you.

917
01:16:55,088 --> 01:16:57,257
It'll only hurt for a moment.

918
01:16:57,549 --> 01:16:58,550
Come on. Ready?

919
01:16:59,551 --> 01:17:00,635
Come on. Go!

920
01:18:39,025 --> 01:18:40,610
Come on. Come on.

921
01:18:54,749 --> 01:18:58,545
I thought: 'Run for your life
before he kills you both.'

922
01:18:59,004 --> 01:19:00,714
You know what the klutz did?

923
01:19:01,214 --> 01:19:04,301
No, and I don't care.

924
01:19:04,676 --> 01:19:07,262
He came home
one night dead drunk

925
01:19:07,596 --> 01:19:09,389
and he wanted to fix the sink.

926
01:19:09,681 --> 01:19:11,474
I couldn't believe him.

927
01:19:11,766 --> 01:19:13,977
Enough of me.
Let's talk about you.

928
01:19:14,352 --> 01:19:15,729
Bartender.

929
01:19:18,607 --> 01:19:21,401
You wouldn't happen to know
a Mary Swanson?

930
01:19:22,569 --> 01:19:23,778
Mary Swanson?

931
01:19:24,279 --> 01:19:27,157
Yeah, she comes in here
all the time.

932
01:19:28,533 --> 01:19:30,952
- What's that supposed to mean?
- She has dinner.

933
01:19:33,830 --> 01:19:34,956
I'm sorry.

934
01:19:40,420 --> 01:19:42,547
Do you know where she lives?

935
01:19:43,673 --> 01:19:46,843
Her family has the big place
up on Alpine Drive.

936
01:19:47,344 --> 01:19:48,637
Alpine Drive?

937
01:19:48,887 --> 01:19:50,055
Big place?

938
01:19:55,226 --> 01:19:57,520
MAN WALKS ON THE MOON

939
01:19:58,229 --> 01:19:59,731
No way!

940
01:20:01,900 --> 01:20:03,818
That's great!

941
01:20:04,194 --> 01:20:05,987
We landed on the Moon!

942
01:20:13,578 --> 01:20:17,374
Today was just what I needed.
Thanks a lot.

943
01:20:20,377 --> 01:20:22,462
It was pleasure, Mary.

944
01:20:23,588 --> 01:20:26,091
You'll pick me up tonight,
at 7.45?

945
01:20:26,424 --> 01:20:29,094
No, I've got some things
to take care of first.

946
01:20:29,427 --> 01:20:31,221
Let's make it
quarter to eight.

947
01:20:32,764 --> 01:20:34,140
Stop it.

948
01:20:35,475 --> 01:20:37,477
Okay, 7.45.

949
01:20:41,189 --> 01:20:42,190
Bye.

950
01:21:27,193 --> 01:21:30,405
It doesn't make sense.
She told me 10 o'clock, sharp.

951
01:21:30,739 --> 01:21:32,741
You sure you went to
the right bar?

952
01:21:33,033 --> 01:21:34,034
Oh, yeah.

953
01:21:35,827 --> 01:21:37,537
I'm pretty sure.

954
01:21:37,913 --> 01:21:40,040
Lobby bar,
right in the lobby.

955
01:21:41,708 --> 01:21:42,709
Well...

956
01:21:43,668 --> 01:21:46,087
Maybe she had
a change of heart.

957
01:21:46,504 --> 01:21:49,591
That pisses me off.
That pisses me right off.

958
01:21:49,925 --> 01:21:51,426
I hate when women do that.

959
01:21:52,427 --> 01:21:55,597
She wanted to see you again.
She told me. And now, no.

960
01:21:55,972 --> 01:21:57,474
Wait a minute.
Wait.

961
01:21:58,725 --> 01:22:01,102
She must have meant 10 at night!

962
01:22:03,188 --> 01:22:04,189
Do you think?

963
01:22:04,397 --> 01:22:06,733
Why meet at a bar
at 10 in the morning?

964
01:22:07,734 --> 01:22:09,861
I figured she was
a raging alcoholic.

965
01:22:16,701 --> 01:22:18,620
And I've been going

966
01:22:18,912 --> 01:22:21,414
through such pain and anguish.

967
01:22:22,040 --> 01:22:24,542
Such hell! For nothing!

968
01:22:25,293 --> 01:22:26,586
God, that's funny.

969
01:22:26,836 --> 01:22:28,713
Oh, that's good stuff.

970
01:22:29,005 --> 01:22:30,924
Well, listen...

971
01:22:31,216 --> 01:22:34,302
Your night's planned,
so I'll go catch a flick.

972
01:22:34,678 --> 01:22:35,679
Okay.

973
01:22:38,473 --> 01:22:40,100
Ten in the morning.

974
01:22:57,909 --> 01:23:00,120
Harry, old buddy, old pal.

975
01:23:02,205 --> 01:23:04,708
Join me in a good luck toast
before you go?

976
01:23:05,208 --> 01:23:08,211
Sure. Whatever you think
will help your chances.

977
01:23:08,545 --> 01:23:10,046
Yes, siree.

978
01:23:12,215 --> 01:23:13,592
You know why I like you?

979
01:23:13,842 --> 01:23:15,552
'Cause you're a regular guy.

980
01:23:18,221 --> 01:23:20,223
That's why I want you
to stay regular.

981
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:25,103
One half teaspoon
for fast, effective relief.

982
01:23:47,125 --> 01:23:49,127
To my friend, Harry.

983
01:23:49,711 --> 01:23:50,795
The matchmaker.

984
01:23:52,339 --> 01:23:54,758
Get out of here.

985
01:24:20,617 --> 01:24:23,286
Hi, the door's open.
Come upstairs.

986
01:24:30,085 --> 01:24:33,171
Make yourself at home.
I'm almost ready. One minute.

987
01:24:33,713 --> 01:24:35,090
Sounds good.

988
01:25:59,299 --> 01:26:01,426
Harry? Are you in there?

989
01:26:03,178 --> 01:26:04,179
Be right out.

990
01:26:05,472 --> 01:26:07,849
Don't use the toilet.
It's broken.

991
01:26:11,519 --> 01:26:13,605
The toilet doesn't flush.

992
01:26:15,190 --> 01:26:17,067
No, I was just shaving.

993
01:26:17,984 --> 01:26:19,110
Shaving?

994
01:26:19,361 --> 01:26:21,154
I was running late.

995
01:26:21,446 --> 01:26:23,823
I thought this would save time.

996
01:26:28,328 --> 01:26:30,413
I'll be in the kitchen.

997
01:26:33,416 --> 01:26:35,126
Oh, Jeez.

998
01:26:51,017 --> 01:26:52,227
Tomorrow,

999
01:26:52,602 --> 01:26:55,522
inside the home of
the Menendez brothers' attorney.

1000
01:26:55,855 --> 01:26:59,234
We'll be back with
the heartbreaking story

1001
01:26:59,568 --> 01:27:02,487
of the blind Rhode Island boy
who was duped into

1002
01:27:02,821 --> 01:27:05,031
buying a dead parakeet.

1003
01:27:05,323 --> 01:27:08,326
I just thought
he was real quiet.

1004
01:27:12,914 --> 01:27:15,000
Who are these sick people?

1005
01:27:19,921 --> 01:27:21,089
Hi.

1006
01:27:24,509 --> 01:27:25,635
Remember me?

1007
01:27:28,471 --> 01:27:29,973
Not really.

1008
01:27:31,057 --> 01:27:32,767
Providence.

1009
01:27:34,311 --> 01:27:37,772
- I drove you to the airport.
- Oh, my God.

1010
01:27:39,482 --> 01:27:40,609
Lloyd, right?

1011
01:27:41,610 --> 01:27:43,528
You remembered my name.

1012
01:27:45,030 --> 01:27:48,450
- Why are you in Aspen?
- I brought your briefcase.

1013
01:27:48,825 --> 01:27:51,536
You left it in the airport,
you big goof.

1014
01:27:52,537 --> 01:27:54,122
You have my briefcase?

1015
01:27:55,457 --> 01:27:57,584
It's at my hotel.

1016
01:27:57,834 --> 01:27:59,669
Jump on the bike and we'll get it.

1017
01:27:59,961 --> 01:28:01,087
Unless...

1018
01:28:02,547 --> 01:28:04,174
Unless you're busy.
I'll...

1019
01:28:04,424 --> 01:28:06,426
No. You wait right here.

1020
01:28:06,718 --> 01:28:08,637
No. I don't want to...

1021
01:28:13,934 --> 01:28:16,102
Come on. Flush, you bastard.

1022
01:28:20,815 --> 01:28:22,317
What are you doing in there?

1023
01:28:24,694 --> 01:28:26,780
I'm just cleaning my teeth.

1024
01:28:27,697 --> 01:28:30,617
Sorry, something important
has come up.

1025
01:28:30,909 --> 01:28:32,035
I must run out.

1026
01:28:32,285 --> 01:28:35,580
- An emergency. I'll explain later.
- But Mary...

1027
01:28:35,914 --> 01:28:38,124
I'm sorry.
I've got to go.

1028
01:28:38,416 --> 01:28:40,418
I promise we'll do this again.

1029
01:28:52,389 --> 01:28:53,890
Race you to the top.

1030
01:29:06,486 --> 01:29:07,696
I won.

1031
01:29:08,655 --> 01:29:10,282
Look familiar?

1032
01:29:11,157 --> 01:29:12,742
I don't believe you have it!

1033
01:29:13,118 --> 01:29:14,452
Of course I have it.

1034
01:29:14,703 --> 01:29:18,206
If I drive a woman to the airport,
I make sure she gets her luggage.

1035
01:29:18,582 --> 01:29:20,083
That's my whole philosophy.

1036
01:29:20,333 --> 01:29:22,544
This is incredible.

1037
01:29:22,836 --> 01:29:24,838
You drove 2,000 miles...

1038
01:29:25,130 --> 01:29:26,256
just for me?

1039
01:29:28,049 --> 01:29:29,968
I didn't really have...

1040
01:29:30,260 --> 01:29:32,554
a lot to do.

1041
01:29:33,763 --> 01:29:36,683
And I know how frustrating it is
to lose a bag.

1042
01:29:38,685 --> 01:29:40,687
That is so sweet, Lloyd.

1043
01:29:55,785 --> 01:29:58,079
Look, this may seem sudden,

1044
01:29:58,413 --> 01:30:00,624
but I've given it some thought.

1045
01:30:01,082 --> 01:30:03,084
I've waited for you all my life,

1046
01:30:03,418 --> 01:30:05,337
and I'm not ashamed to admit it.

1047
01:30:05,587 --> 01:30:06,588
Please...

1048
01:30:07,797 --> 01:30:09,090
Let me finish.

1049
01:30:11,509 --> 01:30:13,303
I'm crazy about you.

1050
01:30:13,637 --> 01:30:16,348
I've never felt this way
about anybody.

1051
01:30:17,182 --> 01:30:18,475
Listen to me.

1052
01:30:18,767 --> 01:30:21,645
I feel like a schoolboy again,

1053
01:30:23,021 --> 01:30:25,523
who desperately wants
to make sweet,

1054
01:30:25,815 --> 01:30:27,400
sweet love to you.

1055
01:30:38,620 --> 01:30:40,956
I thought you were
talking to someone.

1056
01:30:52,092 --> 01:30:54,594
I desperately want to make love
to a schoolboy.

1057
01:30:56,888 --> 01:30:58,974
- Maybe I should be going.
- No.

1058
01:31:02,852 --> 01:31:04,563
That's not what I meant.

1059
01:31:09,276 --> 01:31:11,486
What I meant was...

1060
01:31:16,491 --> 01:31:18,285
I like you, Mary.

1061
01:31:22,414 --> 01:31:24,541
I like you a lot.

1062
01:31:27,002 --> 01:31:29,588
I want to ask you a question,
straight out,

1063
01:31:29,921 --> 01:31:33,008
flat out, and I want you
to give me an honest answer.

1064
01:31:34,175 --> 01:31:36,886
What do you think
the chances are of...

1065
01:31:37,220 --> 01:31:39,514
a guy like you
and a girl like me...

1066
01:31:41,933 --> 01:31:43,435
ending up together?

1067
01:31:44,102 --> 01:31:47,898
Difficult to say.
We really don't...

1068
01:31:48,732 --> 01:31:51,318
Hit me with it.
Give it to me straight.

1069
01:31:51,651 --> 01:31:54,154
I came a long way to see you.

1070
01:31:54,529 --> 01:31:58,241
You can at least level with me.
What are my chances?

1071
01:31:59,618 --> 01:32:00,744
Not good.

1072
01:32:05,707 --> 01:32:09,377
You mean 'not good' like
one out of 100?

1073
01:32:09,753 --> 01:32:11,254
I'd say,

1074
01:32:11,755 --> 01:32:13,924
more like one out of a million.

1075
01:32:20,305 --> 01:32:23,099
So you're telling me
there's a chance?

1076
01:32:29,606 --> 01:32:30,774
I read you.

1077
01:32:39,824 --> 01:32:43,703
- We have plenty of towels, thanks.
- Nicholas! Why are you here?

1078
01:32:44,079 --> 01:32:47,374
I was looking for you.
I have news about your husband.

1079
01:32:48,875 --> 01:32:50,085
Husband?

1080
01:32:50,710 --> 01:32:52,337
Wait a minute.

1081
01:32:53,630 --> 01:32:56,549
What was all that
'one in a million' talk?

1082
01:32:58,260 --> 01:33:00,470
Aren't you going to
invite me in?

1083
01:33:05,934 --> 01:33:08,353
Hey, Harry.
You never called.

1084
01:33:09,604 --> 01:33:10,730
What are you doing here?

1085
01:33:15,485 --> 01:33:16,653
Excuse me, Gunman...

1086
01:33:17,112 --> 01:33:18,113
Who are you?

1087
01:33:18,405 --> 01:33:20,699
Don't play dumb, asshole.

1088
01:33:20,991 --> 01:33:23,076
I'm the owner of the briefcase.

1089
01:33:24,452 --> 01:33:26,121
Oh, well.

1090
01:33:26,621 --> 01:33:27,706
Nicholas.

1091
01:33:27,956 --> 01:33:29,374
My family trusted you.

1092
01:33:29,666 --> 01:33:30,542
Shut up!

1093
01:33:32,043 --> 01:33:32,836
Listen,

1094
01:33:33,461 --> 01:33:34,379
Mr. Samsonite,

1095
01:33:34,671 --> 01:33:36,464
about the briefcase,

1096
01:33:36,756 --> 01:33:39,134
we intend to reimburse you.

1097
01:33:42,137 --> 01:33:43,847
Open it up!

1098
01:33:44,222 --> 01:33:46,850
Go ahead, open it up.
Do what he says.

1099
01:33:47,559 --> 01:33:48,351
Hurry.

1100
01:33:54,232 --> 01:33:55,567
What is this?

1101
01:33:55,901 --> 01:33:57,611
Where's all the money?

1102
01:33:58,403 --> 01:34:00,322
That's as good as money.

1103
01:34:00,614 --> 01:34:02,198
Those are IOUs.

1104
01:34:02,490 --> 01:34:05,076
Add it up.
Every cent's accounted for.

1105
01:34:05,493 --> 01:34:06,620
Look.

1106
01:34:07,037 --> 01:34:08,038
See this?

1107
01:34:08,455 --> 01:34:10,332
That's a car. 275 thou'.

1108
01:34:10,624 --> 01:34:12,417
Might want to hang onto that one.

1109
01:34:17,172 --> 01:34:19,174
You're a dead man.

1110
01:34:25,847 --> 01:34:26,723
I'm home.

1111
01:34:28,308 --> 01:34:30,644
Look, we got to have
a serious talk.

1112
01:34:30,936 --> 01:34:32,437
I got a confession to make.

1113
01:34:32,687 --> 01:34:35,774
Good. You found her.
I'll leave you two alone.

1114
01:34:36,358 --> 01:34:38,068
No, stay.

1115
01:34:45,533 --> 01:34:47,744
A one-way ticket to Amsterdam,

1116
01:34:48,036 --> 01:34:50,121
departing as soon as possible.

1117
01:34:50,538 --> 01:34:52,749
How do you two guys
know each other?

1118
01:34:53,458 --> 01:34:56,753
- We were best friends.
- Till he became a back-stabber.

1119
01:34:57,212 --> 01:34:59,714
Me a back-stabber?
You got a lot of nerve!

1120
01:35:00,131 --> 01:35:01,800
You knew I was crazy
about her.

1121
01:35:02,217 --> 01:35:05,303
You knew I was crazy about Freda
but it didn't stop you.

1122
01:35:07,639 --> 01:35:09,140
What do you mean?

1123
01:35:09,391 --> 01:35:11,309
'What do you mean?'
Don't deny it.

1124
01:35:11,601 --> 01:35:14,729
She told me the sleazy story,
Mr. French Tickler.

1125
01:35:18,275 --> 01:35:20,485
What time does that leave?

1126
01:35:21,403 --> 01:35:24,489
Thanks. Wait, can I have
a vegetarian meal?

1127
01:35:25,156 --> 01:35:27,659
We learned something
about each other, didn't we?

1128
01:35:28,076 --> 01:35:30,787
Maybe we're not
as good friends as we thought.

1129
01:35:31,121 --> 01:35:31,997
Yeah.

1130
01:35:32,247 --> 01:35:34,874
If one beautiful girl
can rip us apart like this...

1131
01:35:35,166 --> 01:35:38,461
maybe our friendship isn't worth it.
Let's call it quits.

1132
01:35:38,795 --> 01:35:40,505
Tell me where to sign.

1133
01:35:40,797 --> 01:35:42,591
On my ass, after you kiss it.

1134
01:35:42,882 --> 01:35:46,386
Kiss it! Kiss mine!
Both cheeks, both lips.

1135
01:35:48,179 --> 01:35:50,599
- Come on, put it...
- Shut up!

1136
01:35:52,267 --> 01:35:54,728
Which one of you two losers
wants to get it first?

1137
01:35:56,563 --> 01:35:58,148
Over here.

1138
01:35:59,357 --> 01:36:03,028
I got you into this mess.
Come on, shoot me.

1139
01:36:04,029 --> 01:36:05,655
No, wait!

1140
01:36:05,947 --> 01:36:08,825
Wait. Do me first.
I stole your girl. I deserve it.

1141
01:36:09,159 --> 01:36:11,077
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.

1142
01:36:11,786 --> 01:36:15,165
- You don't.
- I do. Yesterday was great.

1143
01:36:15,498 --> 01:36:19,210
Mary and I skied, made a snowman.
She touched my leg.

1144
01:36:19,586 --> 01:36:21,463
Okay, kill him.

1145
01:36:32,599 --> 01:36:35,310
You killed my best friend,
you bastard!

1146
01:36:35,644 --> 01:36:38,939
If it's a consolation,
you're to be reunited.

1147
01:36:46,988 --> 01:36:48,990
You're alive!

1148
01:36:50,242 --> 01:36:51,910
And you're a horrible shot.

1149
01:36:53,245 --> 01:36:54,871
- Lucky me.
- Police. Open up.

1150
01:36:55,538 --> 01:36:58,250
Nobody move. Everybody freeze.
Get those...

1151
01:36:58,541 --> 01:36:59,876
hands up!

1152
01:37:00,252 --> 01:37:01,461
Not you, dummy.

1153
01:37:03,380 --> 01:37:05,674
Special Officer Beth Jordan.
F.B.I.

1154
01:37:07,133 --> 01:37:08,218
Who?

1155
01:37:08,468 --> 01:37:11,179
Mr. Dunne, we couldn't have
done it without you.

1156
01:37:12,764 --> 01:37:15,350
We followed you guys
all the way from Providence.

1157
01:37:15,767 --> 01:37:17,686
What's going on, Harry?

1158
01:37:18,186 --> 01:37:20,605
Your name is Harry, isn't it?

1159
01:37:20,897 --> 01:37:23,858
She grabbed me in the lobby,
explained what was up.

1160
01:37:24,234 --> 01:37:27,737
They put a bulletproof vest on me
and gave me a gun.

1161
01:37:30,490 --> 01:37:32,409
What if he shot you
in the face?

1162
01:37:33,827 --> 01:37:35,328
What if he shot me
in the face?

1163
01:37:36,121 --> 01:37:38,415
That's a risk
we were willing to take.

1164
01:37:38,748 --> 01:37:40,333
How come I didn't get a gun?

1165
01:37:40,709 --> 01:37:42,127
Did you get a gun?

1166
01:38:10,739 --> 01:38:12,324
You were right.

1167
01:38:12,699 --> 01:38:14,993
She was definitely
worth the trip.

1168
01:38:17,495 --> 01:38:19,497
She's something, ain't she?

1169
01:38:19,915 --> 01:38:22,792
- I'm glad we could help her.
- Yep.

1170
01:38:31,593 --> 01:38:33,178
- Bobby!
- Easy, easy.

1171
01:38:33,428 --> 01:38:35,555
- You're okay.
- I'm okay, just a little sore.

1172
01:38:35,847 --> 01:38:36,973
I'm sorry.

1173
01:38:37,223 --> 01:38:40,685
- Sweetie.
- Baby, I missed your loving.

1174
01:38:41,061 --> 01:38:43,271
I want you to meet the kindest,

1175
01:38:43,563 --> 01:38:45,565
gentlest man I've ever met

1176
01:38:45,899 --> 01:38:47,484
- Will you meet him?
- Sure.

1177
01:38:47,734 --> 01:38:49,027
He's got a gun!

1178
01:38:57,327 --> 01:38:59,829
I said
'This is my husband, Bobby.'

1179
01:39:01,623 --> 01:39:02,999
- Hi, Bobby.
- Hi.

1180
01:39:03,291 --> 01:39:06,002
I'm so happy for you.

1181
01:39:07,003 --> 01:39:08,004
Thank you.

1182
01:39:08,255 --> 01:39:10,548
Thank you both very much.

1183
01:39:10,966 --> 01:39:14,302
I owe you both
a debt of gratitude.

1184
01:39:15,053 --> 01:39:15,845
Thank you.

1185
01:39:35,073 --> 01:39:37,075
I can't believe this.

1186
01:39:37,784 --> 01:39:41,162
First Mary dumps us.
Then the cops take our nest egg.

1187
01:39:41,621 --> 01:39:43,623
Then our hog breaks down.

1188
01:39:44,165 --> 01:39:46,459
When will we ever
catch a break?

1189
01:40:00,932 --> 01:40:01,933
Hi, y'all.

1190
01:40:03,226 --> 01:40:05,896
Guys, we're going on
a national bikini tour,

1191
01:40:06,229 --> 01:40:10,150
and we need two oil boys
to grease us up before competitions.

1192
01:40:15,405 --> 01:40:17,115
You are in luck.

1193
01:40:18,033 --> 01:40:20,327
There's a town 3 miles that way.

1194
01:40:20,619 --> 01:40:22,829
You'll find two guys there.

1195
01:40:26,249 --> 01:40:28,585
Okay, thanks.

1196
01:40:37,636 --> 01:40:40,221
Do you realize
what you've done?

1197
01:40:44,309 --> 01:40:45,727
Wait!

1198
01:40:54,277 --> 01:40:56,404
You'll have to excuse my friend.

1199
01:40:56,738 --> 01:40:58,740
He's a little slow.

1200
01:40:59,950 --> 01:41:01,826
The town is back that way.

1201
01:41:14,631 --> 01:41:17,133
Two lucky guys
will be driving around

1202
01:41:17,467 --> 01:41:20,136
with those girls
for the next couple of months.

1203
01:41:21,972 --> 01:41:24,558
Don't worry,
we'll catch our break too.

1204
01:41:24,849 --> 01:41:26,935
Just got to keep our eyes open.

1205
01:41:27,561 --> 01:41:28,478
Yep.

1206
01:42:00,379 --> 01:46:32,479
