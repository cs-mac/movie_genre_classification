1
00:00:50,049 --> 00:00:51,619
- Okay. Are we doing-
- Hi.

2
00:00:51,717 --> 00:00:53,355
- How are you?
- I'm not comin' out there.

3
00:00:53,452 --> 00:00:56,558
It's only a day and a half of work,
and you gonna be making $150.

4
00:00:56,656 --> 00:00:59,159
- I look like a damn fool.
- I'm gonna come in.

5
00:00:59,258 --> 00:01:01,829
Okay. One, two, three...

6
00:01:02,528 --> 00:01:04,007
You better stop it.

7
00:01:04,096 --> 00:01:07,270
Eileen, you come in on three.
You dorft say, "One, two," and come in.

8
00:01:07,366 --> 00:01:08,902
You say, "Three."
Then you come in.

9
00:01:09,001 --> 00:01:13,711
Look at you.
You are dressed for success.

10
00:01:13,806 --> 00:01:15,808
I look like
the whole damn red-light district.

11
00:01:15,908 --> 00:01:18,149
I airft had nothing like this on
since I was on that pole.

12
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:22,317
Ooh. Well, just think of this
as another pole. The North Pole.

13
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:24,122
They dorft make it rain at the North Pole.

14
00:01:24,216 --> 00:01:26,025
At my age, I carft get no rain nowhere.

15
00:01:26,118 --> 00:01:28,098
I get a little drizzle,
but them quarters hurt.

16
00:01:30,356 --> 00:01:33,132
No, no, no.
Well, this is beautiful.

17
00:01:33,225 --> 00:01:36,468
Just think of this as a little extra money
for you and Cora.

18
00:01:36,562 --> 00:01:38,269
Honey, I dorft buy Cora
nothing for Christmas.

19
00:01:38,364 --> 00:01:40,173
I ain't bought her nothing
since she was seven.

20
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:41,609
- You're kidding.
- That's right.

21
00:01:41,701 --> 00:01:44,545
Cora asked me for some money
for some dolls named Starz.

22
00:01:44,637 --> 00:01:46,480
I couldrft afford it.
She just Wanted them Starz.

23
00:01:46,572 --> 00:01:48,552
So all day Christmas,
she made me feel bad.

24
00:01:48,641 --> 00:01:50,882
That night, Christmas dinner,
she's still sitting at the table crying.

25
00:01:50,977 --> 00:01:53,514
I knocked the hell out of her.
You know What happened?

26
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:56,184
She saw stars. And she never
asked me for another gift.

27
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:58,489
- You are dreadful. Yes, you are.
- The truth.

28
00:01:58,584 --> 00:02:01,326
- I carft do this, Eileen.
- Yes, you can. Stop.

29
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:02,899
- Now, just smile.
- Okay. I'm smiling.

30
00:02:02,989 --> 00:02:04,969
Now, you should see-
Come over here.

31
00:02:05,057 --> 00:02:06,536
I gotta take you Where you Working.

32
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:09,937
You should see the lovely gifts
I bought for my daughter.

33
00:02:10,029 --> 00:02:12,373
- How she doing?
- Oh, she is excellent.

34
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:14,536
You know she Went to New York
to get a degree...

35
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:18,377
got her mastefis and up and moved
to Alabama of all places.

36
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:21,077
- What the hell she move to Alabama for?
- Who knows.

37
00:02:21,173 --> 00:02:25,383
Anyway, she took a little job there
in some little, small school, you know.

38
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:28,118
She says she wants to start a farm.

39
00:02:29,148 --> 00:02:33,187
- A farm? What she starting a farm for?
- I dorft know. I dorft know.

40
00:02:33,285 --> 00:02:36,732
But anyway, you know she got
tons of offers clown here in Atlanta.

41
00:02:36,822 --> 00:02:39,462
But she didn't Want to,
so What can you do?

42
00:02:39,558 --> 00:02:42,164
- Maybe she's trying to get away from you.
- You better stop that.

43
00:02:42,261 --> 00:02:44,036
- Where we going?
- My daughter loves me.

44
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:48,135
Round yon Virgin Mother-

45
00:02:50,369 --> 00:02:52,349
- Was that you singing?
- No, mafam.

46
00:02:53,372 --> 00:02:56,581
There's no one else in there,
Bailey McCoy.

47
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:59,520
Come on. Walk with me.
You're late again.

48
00:02:59,612 --> 00:03:00,886
I'm sorry.

49
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:03,221
- I'm gonna have to talk to your parents.
- No.

50
00:03:03,315 --> 00:03:06,819
I just woke up late.
I'll be here on time. I promise.

51
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:08,398
Budget cuts, budget cuts.

52
00:03:08,487 --> 00:03:10,592
All right.
Go on in class.

53
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,601
- We'll talk about this later. Okay?
- Okay.

54
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:14,831
And your singing.

55
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:20,576
I'm not gonna come in here
and listen to this.

56
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:25,911
All right, people!

57
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,411
Now, we may have to cancel
the Christmas Jubilee this year.

58
00:03:30,509 --> 00:03:33,046
- No way!
- We dorft have the budget!

59
00:03:33,145 --> 00:03:34,988
Mayor, you hold on right there.

60
00:03:35,081 --> 00:03:36,992
All right?
Now, I grew "poinsetters" for this.

61
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:38,391
Poinsettias.

62
00:03:38,484 --> 00:03:40,088
- That's What I said.
- No, you didn't.

63
00:03:41,187 --> 00:03:42,962
If this Christmas Jubilee
dorft happen...

64
00:03:43,055 --> 00:03:44,864
What am I gonna do
with all them "poinsetters"?

65
00:03:44,957 --> 00:03:47,267
- Poinsettias.
- Stop. Do I look stupid?

66
00:03:47,359 --> 00:03:49,270
- Tanner, I understand.
- No, sir...

67
00:03:49,361 --> 00:03:51,466
with all due respect,
I dorft think you do.

68
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:54,272
Since they built that dam upriver,
we've been barely surviving.

69
00:03:54,366 --> 00:03:56,573
Between that and the drought...

70
00:03:56,669 --> 00:03:58,615
managed to put most of our crops
out of business.

71
00:03:58,704 --> 00:04:00,615
We need this Christmas Jubilee to happen.
You hear me?

72
00:04:00,706 --> 00:04:03,653
We dorft have the money.
I talked to the city council, didn't I?

73
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:05,916
You did, Your Honor.
He talked to him. I heard him.

74
00:04:06,011 --> 00:04:09,356
- Take it out of the school.
- Hold on, Tanner McCoy.

75
00:04:09,448 --> 00:04:11,587
We've already out
the schooFs budget...

76
00:04:11,684 --> 00:04:14,164
and as principal,
I have to draw the line.

77
00:04:14,253 --> 00:04:16,995
We have four teachers
teaching several classes.

78
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:20,195
If we out back more, we'll not be able
to finish the school year.

79
00:04:20,292 --> 00:04:23,068
I dorft care.
Somebody has to do something.

80
00:04:23,162 --> 00:04:25,039
We have to have
this Christmas Jubilee.

81
00:04:25,131 --> 00:04:28,772
It helps too many people around here
make enough money just to stay open.

82
00:04:28,868 --> 00:04:30,814
We dorft have the budget!

83
00:04:30,903 --> 00:04:34,544
When we elected you as mayor,
you said you would help us!

84
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:38,481
I know. I'm sorry.

85
00:04:38,577 --> 00:04:42,491
Folks around here don't take too kindly
to politicians not keeping their word.

86
00:04:42,581 --> 00:04:46,358
You keep putting all these good people
against the wall and see What happens.

87
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,700
Come on, fellas. Geez.

88
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:51,769
- This is ridiculous.
- Absolutely.

89
00:04:56,662 --> 00:04:58,642
- You believe that guy?
- That was unpleasant.

90
00:04:59,231 --> 00:05:00,710
Yes, it was.

91
00:05:00,866 --> 00:05:02,573
- This is Where you'll be Working.
- Okay.

92
00:05:02,668 --> 00:05:04,511
Okay? Have you ever done sales before?

93
00:05:04,603 --> 00:05:06,583
Yes, I sold trees.

94
00:05:06,672 --> 00:05:08,379
Christmas trees?

95
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:10,454
When you smoke 'em,
they make you feel like it's Christmas.

96
00:05:10,543 --> 00:05:12,523
If you dorft stop that nasty talk.

97
00:05:12,611 --> 00:05:14,682
Stop it.
I mean, Where goods were exchanged.

98
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:16,782
I was exchanging my goodies
back in the day.

99
00:05:16,882 --> 00:05:18,327
Yes, indeed.

100
00:05:18,417 --> 00:05:20,397
- I got to bring-
- On the black market.

101
00:05:22,054 --> 00:05:25,126
- I got to bring you back to church.
- You ain't bringing me to no church.

102
00:05:25,224 --> 00:05:27,568
I airft goin' to no church.
The devil is a lie.

103
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,697
- And you still married to him.
- Honey, honey-

104
00:05:29,795 --> 00:05:31,775
- Speak of the devil, listen. Listen.
- What, what, what?

105
00:05:31,864 --> 00:05:34,003
- Y'all want me to work the register?
- No, no.

106
00:05:34,099 --> 00:05:35,578
- Other people take-
- You sure?

107
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:37,477
You have to be bonded for that job.

108
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:39,481
If I took the register,
I'd be bonded out.

109
00:05:39,572 --> 00:05:41,347
Okay. Yeah.
No, no, no, no.

110
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,252
Listen, let's go over a little quick review
of What you're supposed to do.

111
00:05:45,344 --> 00:05:48,154
- You teach me.
- You're supposed to direct the customers...

112
00:05:48,247 --> 00:05:51,091
when they ask you for something,
and you can refer to this.

113
00:05:51,183 --> 00:05:53,356
Okay? Now, kitchenware
is on the fifth floor.

114
00:05:53,452 --> 00:05:54,931
- Kitchenware, fifth floor.
- Yes.

115
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:56,931
- Womerfs apparel is on the second-
- Y'all sell pears?

116
00:05:57,022 --> 00:05:58,899
Y'all got produce up there?

117
00:05:58,991 --> 00:06:01,494
- Clothing. Women's clothing.
- Say, "Clothing." Don't say, "A pears."

118
00:06:01,594 --> 00:06:03,335
I dorft know What "apparels" is.
"A pears."

119
00:06:03,429 --> 00:06:05,636
Okay. Young adults
is on the third floor.

120
00:06:05,731 --> 00:06:09,508
- Young adults on the third floor.
- Makeup and perfume is here.

121
00:06:09,602 --> 00:06:11,104
And over there across the hall.

122
00:06:11,203 --> 00:06:13,444
- I get it. I'll be fine.
- All right, and listen.

123
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:16,281
Most important,
everybody gets the same greeting.

124
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:18,548
When they come in,
you look them in the face...

125
00:06:18,644 --> 00:06:22,387
you smile pretty and you say,
"Merry Christmas.

126
00:06:22,481 --> 00:06:24,757
It's a beautiful day at Tiftorfs.

127
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:28,263
Joy to you and yours.
Yes, may I help you?"

128
00:06:28,354 --> 00:06:30,163
That What I say?
Fine. I will say that.

129
00:06:30,256 --> 00:06:32,532
- You wanna go over it once?
- All right.

130
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:35,435
- Here's a customer. Okay.
- Can you help me?

131
00:06:35,527 --> 00:06:37,165
- Yes. Merry-

132
00:06:37,263 --> 00:06:38,833

133
00:06:38,931 --> 00:06:40,911
- No, Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

134
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,072

135
00:06:44,169 --> 00:06:46,410

136
00:06:46,505 --> 00:06:49,111
Joy to the world and the Lord is come,

137
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:51,688
What can-
What can I do for you at Tiftorfs?

138
00:06:51,777 --> 00:06:53,757
Thank you.
I'm looking for women's lingerie.

139
00:06:54,546 --> 00:06:57,083
Honey?
Who the lingerie for?

140
00:06:57,182 --> 00:06:58,820
For me, of course.

141
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,297
I dorft know about you
wearing the lingeries.

142
00:07:02,388 --> 00:07:05,801
Those days are over, honey.
Somebody should've told you it's passed.

143
00:07:05,891 --> 00:07:08,667
The lingeries is for young people
with tight, firm stuff.

144
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:11,139
What I would suggest you do, hunty...

145
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:14,006
I would suggest you Walk
across the street to Target...

146
00:07:14,099 --> 00:07:18,741
and ask them for some of those
really nice big, big-girl drawers...

147
00:07:18,837 --> 00:07:20,748
so that you will be comfortable.

148
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:22,785
You dorft wanna Walk around
with a slingshot up your butt.

149
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:24,377
- Eileen!
- Come, come, come.

150
00:07:24,476 --> 00:07:25,955
Come. Let me help you.

151
00:07:26,045 --> 00:07:27,854
- You are so rude!
- She's something.

152
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:31,986
No, you are the one that's rude
anytime you bring lingerie to a man.

153
00:07:32,084 --> 00:07:35,088
Who was the 37th president
of the United States?

154
00:07:35,187 --> 00:07:36,666
I know.

155
00:07:40,559 --> 00:07:42,038
Bailey, do you know?

156
00:07:44,763 --> 00:07:46,242
I know the answer.

157
00:07:46,332 --> 00:07:49,404
I didn't ask you.
I asked Bailey.

158
00:07:49,501 --> 00:07:52,778
He dorft know.
He's always dirty.

159
00:07:52,871 --> 00:07:55,317
And he's just a farm boy.

160
00:07:55,407 --> 00:08:00,755
Yes, but he's the only one to get an A
on all three of his last tests.

161
00:08:00,846 --> 00:08:03,156
What did you get, Lucy?

162
00:08:03,248 --> 00:08:04,750
Or you, Larry?

163
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:07,160
There will be no bullying
in this class.

164
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:11,264
I'll see you all tomorrow.
Do your homework.

165
00:08:11,357 --> 00:08:13,860
Look over the list of songs
for the Christmas Jubilee.

166
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:16,872
Christmas is five days away.

167
00:08:16,962 --> 00:08:18,908
Hold on a second, Bailey.

168
00:08:25,137 --> 00:08:28,277
You gotta start speaking up
and participating in class.

169
00:08:28,374 --> 00:08:30,115
I know you knew the answer.

170
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:32,519
You're are so smart and talented.

171
00:08:32,611 --> 00:08:36,718
You get an A on every test.
You gotta believe in yourself.

172
00:08:36,815 --> 00:08:40,285
Lucy's right.
I'm just an old farm boy.

173
00:08:41,653 --> 00:08:44,156
There is no such thing
as "just a farm boy."

174
00:08:44,256 --> 00:08:47,465
You are smart.
You can be anything you want.

175
00:08:48,994 --> 00:08:52,237
I can only imagine
if you could just stay awake in class.

176
00:08:52,331 --> 00:08:54,971
- Are you up late at night?
- No, mafam.

177
00:08:55,067 --> 00:08:58,605
I Want you to sing the lead solo
at the Christmas Jubilee.

178
00:08:59,671 --> 00:09:01,582
I'm sorry. I carft do that.

179
00:09:01,673 --> 00:09:03,983
- Yes, you can.
- No.

180
00:09:05,844 --> 00:09:08,051
You know What?
I really gotta go, Miss Williams.

181
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:11,991
My daddyé gonna be
Waiting for me at home.

182
00:09:13,352 --> 00:09:14,490
Go on.

183
00:09:25,697 --> 00:09:26,835
Hello?

184
00:09:26,932 --> 00:09:28,934
I dorft hear from you in six years...

185
00:09:29,034 --> 00:09:32,311
and you call me out of the blue
because you need my help.

186
00:09:32,404 --> 00:09:33,974
Don't blame that on me.

187
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:36,917
You're the one who married Kelly
and stopped returning my calls.

188
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:38,682
You're not still bitter, are you?

189
00:09:38,777 --> 00:09:41,189
Maybe. How is she?

190
00:09:42,281 --> 00:09:44,955
I dorft know.
We're divorced.

191
00:09:46,151 --> 00:09:47,892
Good. She was such a tramp.

192
00:09:47,986 --> 00:09:51,524
I carft believe you married her
and dumped me. That's What you get.

193
00:09:51,623 --> 00:09:53,694
Okay, okay-

194
00:09:53,792 --> 00:09:56,636
Hey, pull up. It was high school.
Am I forgiven?

195
00:09:56,728 --> 00:10:00,266
That depends. Can you help me
with my school situation?

196
00:10:00,365 --> 00:10:03,209
- So you need sponsorship?
- Yes.

197
00:10:03,302 --> 00:10:05,282
A call came in just as
I was leaving a meeting...

198
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:08,112
with a company
that's in the middle of a PR nightmare.

199
00:10:08,207 --> 00:10:10,448
They could use some goodwill right now.

200
00:10:10,542 --> 00:10:14,285
Actually, in a town like yours.
So your timing may be perfect.

201
00:10:14,379 --> 00:10:16,017
Tell me about it.

202
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:18,959
Can't do that
until we have a contract.

203
00:10:19,051 --> 00:10:22,726
- You dorft trust me?
- No, no, no, it's not that.

204
00:10:22,821 --> 00:10:24,926
I have to protect my interests,
that's all.

205
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:27,766
Tell you What.

206
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:30,101
I'll come clown with a contract,
you get your people to sign...

207
00:10:30,195 --> 00:10:31,868
and I'm sure I can pull in...

208
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:34,808
at least a hundred grand
for your school and its event.

209
00:10:35,601 --> 00:10:38,411
$100,000.
That would be great.

210
00:10:38,504 --> 00:10:40,415
How soon can you get here?

211
00:10:40,506 --> 00:10:42,281
You need the money
right away, don't you?

212
00:10:42,374 --> 00:10:45,082
Yeah. So you're willing
to drive clown to Alabama?

213
00:10:45,177 --> 00:10:47,623
I will drive over tomorrow.

214
00:10:47,713 --> 00:10:50,125
We'll get the contract signed,
then I'll have to leave...

215
00:10:50,215 --> 00:10:53,059
but I'll be back for the event.

216
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:55,132
That would be fantastic.

217
00:10:56,188 --> 00:10:58,566
Oliver, thank you so much.

218
00:10:58,657 --> 00:10:59,795
See you soon.

219
00:10:59,892 --> 00:11:00,996
- You got it.
- Bye.

220
00:11:01,093 --> 00:11:03,266
Child, that Powerball is going up.

221
00:11:06,465 --> 00:11:09,674
Hello? Hey, I need y'all
to go get me some scratch-offs.

222
00:11:09,768 --> 00:11:11,679
- Yeah, and play the numbers for me.
- Can you help me?

223
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:13,272
That Powerball
has gotten really high.

224
00:11:13,372 --> 00:11:14,680
Play number 22-

225
00:11:14,773 --> 00:11:16,753
- Excuse me.

226
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:19,652
Go play them numbers, and bring me
a bunch of scratch offs. Yeah.

227
00:11:19,745 --> 00:11:22,225
Just two, three of 'em.
Don't spend a lot of money.

228
00:11:22,314 --> 00:11:23,554
I need some help!

229
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:25,458
Hold on, 'cause somebodys

00:11:25,551 --> 00:11:27,531
I'm getting ready to choke her.
Hold on.

231
00:11:29,988 --> 00:11:32,662
Lady, you gonna need a damn doctor
if you holler at me again.

232
00:11:32,758 --> 00:11:35,534
Do you understand?
Now, what can I help you with?

233
00:11:35,627 --> 00:11:37,538
- I need a watch for my husband.
- A merfs Watch.

234
00:11:37,629 --> 00:11:40,769
A merfs Watch.
You know, I like it with a leather band.

235
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:43,278
- You know, a Noe mm watch.
- Here are some mews-

236
00:11:43,368 --> 00:11:45,473
Oh, hell.

237
00:11:45,571 --> 00:11:47,414
- Time for my break.
- Break?

238
00:11:47,506 --> 00:11:48,985
No, wait.

239
00:11:49,074 --> 00:11:50,553
- You're so rude.
- Bye, bye, bye.

240
00:11:50,642 --> 00:11:53,384
- You rude as hell. You rude as hell.
- Please. I need a Watch.

241
00:11:53,478 --> 00:11:55,856
Get out of my Way.
I'm trying to go to the break room.

242
00:11:55,948 --> 00:11:56,926
Wait! Come back!

243
00:12:01,386 --> 00:12:02,865
You still here?

244
00:12:03,755 --> 00:12:05,530
He called me back.

245
00:12:05,624 --> 00:12:07,604
Yeah? And?

246
00:12:08,627 --> 00:12:13,337
He thinks he can get us
$100,000 in sponsorship money.

247
00:12:13,432 --> 00:12:15,275
$100,000?

248
00:12:15,367 --> 00:12:17,608
- Oh, my goodness, that would be so great.
- I know.

249
00:12:17,703 --> 00:12:19,944
That would not only pay
for the Jubilee...

250
00:12:20,038 --> 00:12:22,746
that would take us well into
next year's school year.

251
00:12:22,841 --> 00:12:25,185
We could get new books,
maybe even a new computer.

252
00:12:25,277 --> 00:12:28,087
Wait, calm clown.
It hasrTt happened yet. it's not clone.

253
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:30,854
Okay, but I have faith that it is.

254
00:12:30,949 --> 00:12:35,329
Lacey, thank you so much for doing this.
I really appreciate it.

255
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:38,833
I know this school is not the best,
but it is all we got.

256
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:41,370
And I know you could have gone
anywhere in the country...

257
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:43,531
with the credentials you have.

258
00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:45,905
- I love it here.
- Thank you.

259
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:49,470
He's coming down tomorrow
with the contract.

260
00:12:49,568 --> 00:12:52,447
This is so wonderful!
I gotta call the mayor.

261
00:12:52,537 --> 00:12:54,574
- Yes.
- He's gonna be so excited.

262
00:12:54,673 --> 00:12:56,778
This is going to be
a Wonderful Christmas after all!

263
00:12:56,875 --> 00:12:58,354
It's gonna be fantastic.

264
00:13:00,712 --> 00:13:02,350
All right. I'll see you tomorrow.

265
00:13:28,407 --> 00:13:31,149
- Hello?
- I must be dialing the Wrong number.

266
00:13:31,243 --> 00:13:34,224
You said that already,
but you called back five times.

267
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:36,054
So What number you trying to get?

268
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:38,492
I'm trying to reach
my daughter, Lacey.

269
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:40,893
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, she mat winked m. Hem on.

00:13:50,862 --> 00:13:52,364
That was Conner.

273
00:13:52,464 --> 00:13:53,943
Conner?

274
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,440
That's the guy you hired
to help you with the farm?

275
00:13:57,536 --> 00:13:59,243
Yeah, that's him.

276
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:02,080
Okay. [don't know
if I like him up there with you.

277
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:03,653
Suppose he gets fresh...

278
00:14:03,742 --> 00:14:06,052
and you dam have no man
up there to protect you.

279
00:14:06,144 --> 00:14:08,249

282
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:15,688
Yeah, I've been meaning
to talk to you about that.

283
00:14:15,787 --> 00:14:18,097
I'm not gonna be able
to come home this year.

284
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:20,169
What?

285
00:14:20,258 --> 00:14:22,260
Uh-uh. it's Christmas.

286
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:25,137
I know, it's just
I'm just getting settled in...

287
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:27,301
and the farm needs a lot of work.

288
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:29,811
Uh-uh. You not no farmer
in the dell now.

289
00:14:29,901 --> 00:14:31,380
It's not just the farm.

290
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:33,677
They've also decided
to extended the school year...

291
00:14:33,772 --> 00:14:35,251
to the day before Christmas.

292
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:38,116
- What kind of school is that?
- We losta lot of days...

293
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:41,248
because of the storms this summer,
so we have to make them up.

294
00:14:41,346 --> 00:14:43,622
And I'm helping the kids prepare songs
for the Christmas Jubilee.

295
00:14:43,715 --> 00:14:47,595
And we have a budget crisis.
So ifs just too busy right now, Mom.

00:14:56,862 --> 00:14:59,138
I can ask your Aunt Madea
to come with me.

302
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:02,405
Mama, can we just skip it this year?

303
00:15:02,501 --> 00:15:03,980
You bite your tongue.

304
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:06,345
Christmas is the time of year...

305
00:15:06,438 --> 00:15:10,682
when we celebrate the birth of Jesus
with our families anci-

306
00:15:13,145 --> 00:15:15,125
Lacey, I dorft have to tell you that...

307
00:15:15,213 --> 00:15:17,921
you and I are
the only family we have.

308
00:15:18,016 --> 00:15:19,996
I know.
Mom, are you crying?

309
00:15:22,454 --> 00:15:23,956
What was that, Conner?

310
00:15:24,823 --> 00:15:26,268
I didn't say anything.

311
00:15:26,358 --> 00:15:28,998
I'm sorry. Conner needs
my help, Mama. I gotta go.

312
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:31,165
I'll talk to you tomorrow.
Love you. Bye.

313
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:38,415
Do not look at me like that.
You dorft understand.

314
00:15:38,503 --> 00:15:40,278
I didn't say a word.

315
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:47,780
Are you okay?

316
00:15:47,879 --> 00:15:51,918
Girl, I dorft know why I let you
talk me into comin' and doin' this job.

317
00:15:52,017 --> 00:15:54,964
- I didn't take my medicine this morning.
- What medicine?

318
00:15:55,053 --> 00:15:57,158
Five milligrams
of "Dorft choke that ho."

319
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:00,201
These customers gettin' right-

320
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:02,329
I feel I'm getting ready
to maybe catch a case.

321
00:16:02,427 --> 00:16:04,873
- I could spit.
- What's Wrong with you?

322
00:16:05,397 --> 00:16:07,638
Lacey's not coming for Christmas.

323
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:10,105
That ain't no problem.
Children grow up.

324
00:16:10,202 --> 00:16:12,079
They dorft wanna
come home sometimes.

325
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:13,649
Somethings wrong.

326
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:15,978
- Eileen?
- What?

327
00:16:16,074 --> 00:16:19,078
I know that look in your eye.
Don't go jumpin' to no conclusion.

328
00:16:19,845 --> 00:16:22,018
I dorft jump to conclusions.

329
00:16:22,113 --> 00:16:25,026
Last time you Went to the doctor,
you had a rash.

330
00:16:25,116 --> 00:16:28,325
Walked up in there, told the man
you had cancer and you was dying.

331
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:33,165
Madea, many people in my family
have died of cancer.

332
00:16:33,258 --> 00:16:35,204
- I know your family.
- Yes.

333
00:16:35,293 --> 00:16:37,671
- My grandmother.
- Got hit by a bus.

334
00:16:37,762 --> 00:16:41,767
But she had cancer.
My uncle Bayrod.

335
00:16:41,867 --> 00:16:44,507
- Drowned.
- Because he had cancer.

336
00:16:44,603 --> 00:16:46,310
- Eileen?
- What?

337
00:16:46,404 --> 00:16:48,611
No, no, no, no.
Something is wrong.

338
00:16:48,707 --> 00:16:51,347
Something is Wrong with my child,
and I'm gonna find out What it is.

339
00:16:51,443 --> 00:16:54,287
She's down there in the country,
and I dorft know whafs going on.

340
00:16:54,379 --> 00:16:56,882
I haverft seen Where she works,
Where she live.

341
00:16:56,982 --> 00:16:59,462
- It's just awful!
- Your daughter is grown.

342
00:16:59,551 --> 00:17:02,464
Leave her alone. If she waht
to come home, she will come home.

343
00:17:02,554 --> 00:17:04,033
What you planning on doing?

344
00:17:04,723 --> 00:17:06,202
I'm gonna go clown there.

345
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:08,703
I'd like to see that,
'cause you dorft drive.

346
00:17:08,793 --> 00:17:11,774
- You do.
- Child, I ain't goin' to no Alabama.

347
00:17:11,863 --> 00:17:15,436
Last time I was in Alabama, I was chained
to Andy Young and Jesse Jackson.

348
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:18,674
- You marched?
- We wasrﬂt upright when we was marching.

349
00:17:20,805 --> 00:17:23,513
- We gonna go clown there.
- I'm not driving to no Alabama.

350
00:17:23,608 --> 00:17:26,521
All my stuff is illegal.
I dorft like driving through Georgia.

351
00:17:26,611 --> 00:17:28,818
You think I'm gettin' ready
to drive through Alabama?

352
00:17:28,914 --> 00:17:30,894
- I'll pay you.
- What time you wanna leave?

353
00:17:30,982 --> 00:17:32,984
Okay. Good.

354
00:17:33,084 --> 00:17:35,064
No, child. I carft get on the road
with my Cadillac.

355
00:17:35,153 --> 00:17:39,295
It's got 4,785,000 miles on it,
and I just changed the oil in it.

356
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:41,371
Every light on the dashboard say...

357
00:17:41,459 --> 00:17:43,666
"You crazy as hell
if you go anywhere in me."

358
00:17:45,263 --> 00:17:48,506
- Madea-
- I carft do it, hon. I'm sorry.

359
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,581
Have you ever thought maybe she
just don't want to see you, Eileen?

360
00:17:52,671 --> 00:17:54,514
My daughter loves me.

361
00:17:54,606 --> 00:17:57,519
She loves spending time with me.

362
00:17:57,609 --> 00:18:00,920
All right, honey. If you find a ride,
I'll go up there with you.

363
00:18:01,012 --> 00:18:03,424
All right.
Well, I will work on it.

364
00:18:15,994 --> 00:18:17,405
Conner.

365
00:18:18,396 --> 00:18:21,138
- What the hell you think you're doih?
- What are you talking about?

366
00:18:21,232 --> 00:18:23,041
I was down at the feed store.

367
00:18:23,134 --> 00:18:25,171
They tell me you're planning
on planting corn this year.

368
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,806
Yeah, I was.

369
00:18:26,905 --> 00:18:29,044
I plant corn.

370
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:31,814
Well, actually, What I'm working on
can help all of us.

371
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:33,981
- What you're working on?
- Yeah.

372
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:37,526
You think you learned something dowh in
that college that I doh't know about?

373
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:40,256
- That's not What I meant, Tanner.
- No, you don't.

374
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:43,892
And you better find
something else to plant.

375
00:18:43,989 --> 00:18:46,663
You been gone from around here
for far too long.

376
00:18:46,758 --> 00:18:48,328
I mean it, Conner.

377
00:18:48,426 --> 00:18:52,067
Otherwise, I'll be here every day,
kick your ass like I did back in school.

378
00:19:01,006 --> 00:19:04,078
Eileen, we've had
a lot of complaints about your friend.

379
00:19:04,175 --> 00:19:05,654
Oh, no.

00:19:05,744 --> 00:19:07,781
Hey there.

381
00:19:07,879 --> 00:19:10,758

00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:19,526

00:19:19,624 --> 00:19:22,468

00:19:59,164 --> 00:20:01,144
- Stop it!

402
00:20:01,232 --> 00:20:03,234
What's this pulling on me?

403
00:20:03,334 --> 00:20:04,972
You're embarrassing us.

412
00:20:27,959 --> 00:20:29,996
I'm fabulous.
I'm gone with the wind fabulous.

413
00:20:30,095 --> 00:20:31,733
I am so sorry.

414
00:20:50,515 --> 00:20:54,122
Hi. I'm Lacey Williams,
Baileys teacher.

415
00:20:54,219 --> 00:20:56,961
- Right. Come on in.
- Thank you.

416
00:21:01,025 --> 00:21:02,834
- How are you?
- I'm fine.

417
00:21:02,927 --> 00:21:05,168
I just stopped by to talk to you.

418
00:21:05,263 --> 00:21:08,335
I graded another one of Bailey's
homework assignments-

419
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:09,741
Listen, I'm sorry.

420
00:21:09,834 --> 00:21:13,077
He has to help his daddy at night,
so he doesrft get much time to study.

421
00:21:13,171 --> 00:21:16,345
Then he gets up early in the morning
to work with him...

422
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:19,320
so I'll just have to
get on him to do better.

423
00:21:20,478 --> 00:21:22,219
He can't get any better.

424
00:21:22,814 --> 00:21:25,351
- He gets straight A's.
- What?

425
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:29,023
Yeah. And to know he works
after school and in the morning...

426
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,963
is even more impressive.

427
00:21:31,055 --> 00:21:34,662
He really should go to a gifted school
with a fine arts department.

428
00:21:36,394 --> 00:21:37,702
Wow.

429
00:21:39,831 --> 00:21:42,903
I always knew he was smart.
I clicln't know he was that smart.

430
00:21:43,001 --> 00:21:46,471
Me and his daddy
never got much schoolin'.

431
00:21:46,571 --> 00:21:50,018
You really think Bailey
could make it outside of this place?

432
00:21:50,108 --> 00:21:51,781
I know he can.

433
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:55,155
I mean, that's really all I want for him.

434
00:21:55,246 --> 00:21:58,056
Bailey is always telling me
how good you are to him...

435
00:21:58,149 --> 00:22:01,722
and that you defend him
in front of those other kids, so thank you.

436
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:05,267
- Well, hes a very special boy.
- Yeah, he is.

437
00:22:05,356 --> 00:22:07,165
- Have a seat.
- Sure. Thank you.

438
00:22:07,258 --> 00:22:09,670
- Can I get you something to drink?
- Yes.

439
00:22:10,361 --> 00:22:11,840
Thanks.

440
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,279
Thank you.

441
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:23,014
He also told me you Want him to sing
at the Christmas Jubilee?

442
00:22:23,107 --> 00:22:25,451
Yes. He has a beautiful voice.

443
00:22:25,543 --> 00:22:28,183
You think the Jubilee
is gonna happen this year?

444
00:22:28,279 --> 00:22:29,758
Yes, haverft you heard?

445
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:32,419
I got a friend of mine
to get us a sponsorship for it.

446
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:34,428
So ifs definitely gonna happen.

447
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:37,193
- That's great news.
- Yeah, it really is.

448
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:44,540
Oh, he".
What do you wank?

449
00:22:44,629 --> 00:22:47,667
- Hi, I'm Lacey Williams.
- I know who you are.

450
00:22:48,366 --> 00:22:51,142
You're Bailey's teacher.
Bailey's gonna be late to school.

451
00:22:51,236 --> 00:22:54,308
He's got a lot of work to do here,
that's if he makes it at all.

452
00:22:55,073 --> 00:22:57,451
No need come around here no more. Okay?

453
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:00,617
I am so sorry.

612
00:30:49,814 --> 00:30:51,987
Take me anywhere.
I got to get away from your mama.

613
00:30:52,083 --> 00:30:54,393
I'll go to hell and back
to get away from her.

614
00:30:54,485 --> 00:30:56,396
She talk too damn much.

I got pregnant.
Meat Loaf was playing "Dashboard Light."

631
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:41,468
I was sitting up there, and I kept
hitting my head on that steering wheel.

632
00:31:41,565 --> 00:31:43,909
It was just awful.

That's What I used to do.
Drop it.

637
00:31:54,011 --> 00:31:57,652
That car built for comfort
and built for speed, just like me.

638
00:31:57,748 --> 00:32:00,092
This a nice truck,

00:32:42,393 --> 00:32:44,771
- I'll be right back. Thanks, Madea.

654
00:32:44,862 --> 00:32:47,399

655
00:32:47,498 --> 00:32:49,136

00:32:55,105 --> 00:32:58,518
Hello. Hello. Now, y'all got to

657
00:32:58,609 --> 00:33:02,182
Don't act like you- Don't act like this.
Now, calm the hell clown.

658
00:33:02,279 --> 00:33:05,920
I'm in here. Do yourself a favor.
Do the right thing.

659
00:33:06,016 --> 00:33:08,519
- You belong in this class?
- Yes, mafam.

660
00:33:08,619 --> 00:33:11,156

661
00:33:11,255 --> 00:33:12,825
Bailey? Okay. Well, go on.

662
00:33:12,923 --> 00:33:15,995
Your teacher Went down the hall,
and I'm sitting in for her. Have a seat.

663
00:33:16,093 --> 00:33:17,902
You better hope she comes back.

664
00:33:17,995 --> 00:33:20,999
Shes the only teacher
that likes you here.

665
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:27,373
Dorft sit by me.
You are so dirty.

666
00:33:27,471 --> 00:33:29,747
Leave that boy alone.
Where else he gonna sit? Sit clown, son.

667
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,376
Sit clown. Don't worry about her.

668
00:33:31,475 --> 00:33:34,888
Dorft you ever pick on somebody
just 'cause you can. Do you understand?

669
00:33:34,979 --> 00:33:36,959
They used to do that to me
when I was in kindergarten.

670
00:33:37,047 --> 00:33:39,891
'Cause I was six feet tall,
they all Want to talk about me.

671
00:33:39,984 --> 00:33:42,396
I had a full figure and curves
and all that stuff.

672
00:33:42,486 --> 00:33:44,864
They Wanted to make fun of me.
But I wasrft having it.

673
00:33:44,955 --> 00:33:48,596
You understand? I fought back.
That's why I got tough-skinned.

674
00:33:48,692 --> 00:33:51,468
You may have to fight back sometimes.
Do you understand?

675
00:33:51,562 --> 00:33:55,601
Dorft worry about these people in here
trying to make you feel bad.

676
00:33:55,699 --> 00:33:58,578
You got to be nice to people.
Pass it on, niceness.

677
00:33:58,669 --> 00:34:00,580
- Do you understand?
- Yes, mafam.

678
00:34:00,671 --> 00:34:04,312
All right, I'm going to write my name
on the board...

679
00:34:04,408 --> 00:34:06,945
so you all will know
What my name is.

680
00:34:08,145 --> 00:34:10,250
Ain't no chalk.
Y'all ain't got no chalk?

681
00:34:11,282 --> 00:34:13,262
Ain't got no eraser either.
"No oause-"

682
00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:16,160
Okay. I dorft know
What all that mean.

683
00:34:16,253 --> 00:34:19,462
All right.
Well, What we gonna do is-

684
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:22,060
I'm gonna tell y'all a story.

685
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:25,800
This is the story of Christmas.
Christmas.

686
00:34:25,896 --> 00:34:30,311
This is What I learned
when I Went to school- Sunday school.

687
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:34,611
This is the story
of the nativities.

688
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:39,482
Little baby Jesus was born.

689
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:42,057
He was born to the Virgin Mary...

690
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:47,028
J. Blige, and as Mary was on tour...

691
00:34:47,117 --> 00:34:48,926
she met this man named Joe-

692
00:34:49,019 --> 00:34:50,999
Manganiello,
who played a werewolf.

693
00:34:51,088 --> 00:34:53,694
And he was in love with her.
She said, "Joe.

694
00:34:53,791 --> 00:34:56,135
I am thou-ist with the child-ist.

695
00:34:56,226 --> 00:34:59,002
And the holiness is come upon me...

696
00:34:59,096 --> 00:35:01,406
and I'm going to have a baby-ist."

697
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:06,313
And Joe said, "Really?"

698
00:35:06,403 --> 00:35:08,474
They airft know What to do.

699
00:35:08,572 --> 00:35:10,552
So he Went on and stayed with her...

700
00:35:10,641 --> 00:35:14,020
and they Went oh 'cause they
was expecting the holy child.

701
00:35:14,111 --> 00:35:15,590
That's right.

702
00:35:15,679 --> 00:35:20,094
And the Bible say
in second "Deuteronomo"...

703
00:35:20,184 --> 00:35:25,190
that when he came to the earth...

704
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:29,032
he came through the Virgin...
pifia colada.

705
00:35:29,126 --> 00:35:31,106
And as she was there...

706
00:35:31,195 --> 00:35:34,142
they were trying to find somewhere
to have the baby...

707
00:35:34,231 --> 00:35:37,974
but they kept going to all these hotels,
and wouldrft none of 'em let them in.

708
00:35:38,068 --> 00:35:40,014
Marriott. Shut the door.

709
00:35:40,104 --> 00:35:42,243
Hilton. Shut the door.

710
00:35:42,339 --> 00:35:44,979
Tried to get to the Ritz-Carlton,
they said, "You dorft belong here."

711
00:35:45,075 --> 00:35:48,056
Everybody just got put out.
They Went to the Motel 6.

712
00:35:48,145 --> 00:35:51,649
They didh't even leave the light
oh for her. She was in the dark.

713
00:35:52,816 --> 00:35:55,319
Anyway, there was Mary...

714
00:35:55,419 --> 00:35:58,093
'bout to have that baby,
so she sat clown at a bus stop.

715
00:35:58,188 --> 00:36:00,190
MARTA bus passed by,
wouldrft even pick her up...

716
00:36:00,290 --> 00:36:03,066
to take her to the holy city
of Birmingham.

717
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:07,131
And as she sat there,
she Went into laborer.

718
00:36:07,231 --> 00:36:09,302
And as she started laboring...

719
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,380
a mangy dog walked up beside her.

720
00:36:11,468 --> 00:36:14,938
See, God will send you a dog
when you need it, even if you don't.

721
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:17,019
And that dog said,
"Whafs Wrong with you?"

722
00:36:17,107 --> 00:36:20,919
And as she sat there,
she had that baby...

723
00:36:21,011 --> 00:36:23,992
and that baby came
next to that mangy dog.

724
00:36:24,081 --> 00:36:27,290
That's why they say
he was born in a mangy.

725
00:36:27,384 --> 00:36:29,523
Hallelujah.
Let the Lord use ya.

726
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:32,658
Okay, that's the story of the baby Jesus.
That's the hip-hop version.

727
00:36:32,756 --> 00:36:36,101
I'm glad I Went to church
and to Sunday school. Okay.

728
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:39,272
Where my purse?

729
00:36:41,165 --> 00:36:43,076
Where my purse?

730
00:36:44,668 --> 00:36:46,579
Y'all ain't seen
what happened to my purse?

731
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:48,308
I'm gonna tell y'all another story.

732
00:36:48,405 --> 00:36:50,544
This is the story
of Easter Sunday.

733
00:36:50,641 --> 00:36:53,451
Jesus was hanging
between two thieves.

734
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:56,047
One was Baranibus
and the other was the Dinosaurus.

735
00:36:56,146 --> 00:36:58,183
Somebody better find
my purse right now.

736
00:37:00,317 --> 00:37:03,389
- All we have to do is sign that thing?
- Yes.

737
00:37:03,487 --> 00:37:05,763
Lacey told me
you needed the money right away.

738
00:37:05,856 --> 00:37:08,496
So I spoke with my boss
and got the money in advance.

739
00:37:08,592 --> 00:37:10,572
We're both very sure
we'll get the sponsorship.

740
00:37:11,595 --> 00:37:13,165
What's in it for you?

741
00:37:13,263 --> 00:37:16,710
Well, my company gets paid
a 10% commission by the company.

742
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,780
You get the entire 100 grand.

743
00:37:18,869 --> 00:37:21,611
It will help us with the shortfall.

744
00:37:21,705 --> 00:37:24,151
- Is everything okay, Wilbur?
- Yes, Your Honor.

745
00:37:24,241 --> 00:37:27,222
It's good. It is good.

746
00:37:27,845 --> 00:37:29,825
All right then.
Let's do this.

747
00:37:36,353 --> 00:37:38,924
Wonderful. Here you go.

748
00:37:39,022 --> 00:37:42,128
Now, we'll bring the sponsors
clown to the Jubilee for a photo op.

749
00:37:42,226 --> 00:37:44,763
- That's all we ask.
- Of course.

750
00:37:45,796 --> 00:37:47,275
- Thank you, son.
- You got it.

751
00:37:47,364 --> 00:37:48,934
Thank you so much.

752
00:37:49,032 --> 00:37:51,273
You have no idea
how much we needed this.

753
00:37:51,368 --> 00:37:53,473
- It's my pleasure.
- Lacey.

754
00:37:53,570 --> 00:37:56,551
- Thank you.
- This is my town too.

755
00:37:57,574 --> 00:37:59,053
Glad I can help.

- Thank you.
- Thank you.

757
00:38:01,812 --> 00:38:03,291
After you.

758
00:38:04,882 --> 00:38:06,361
There you go.

759
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:09,260
You have no clue how much
you've just helped us. I mean-

760
00:38:09,953 --> 00:38:12,934
It was my pleasure.
I'm glad I could help.

761
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:16,969
- Thank you again.
- You got it.

762
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:19,267
- Here.
- What's this?

763
00:38:19,363 --> 00:38:22,037
- It's your Christmas present.
- No. I can't take that.

764
00:38:22,132 --> 00:38:24,578
- Sure you can.
- I really carft.

765
00:38:24,668 --> 00:38:26,978
You've already done enough for us.
Thank you.

766
00:38:31,241 --> 00:38:32,549
What are you doing?

767
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:34,748
Your mother told me
she thought you missed me.

768
00:38:36,513 --> 00:38:40,188
Look, I know we were children,
but I think about you still.

769
00:38:40,284 --> 00:38:42,195
Listen, Oliver,
that was a long time ago...

770
00:38:42,286 --> 00:38:44,664
- and I actually have to tell you-
- Lacey!

771
00:38:44,755 --> 00:38:46,996
- Get in here. Quick!
- Excuse me.

772
00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:48,569
Hurry!

773
00:38:49,259 --> 00:38:50,897
There's a weird Woman in here.

774
00:38:50,994 --> 00:38:53,031
What they did back in the day-

775
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:54,507
Lacey, who is this?

776
00:38:54,598 --> 00:38:56,942
- My aunt Madea.
- Hi.

777
00:38:57,034 --> 00:38:58,377
What are you doing?

778
00:38:58,468 --> 00:39:01,574
I was just teaching these children
a lesson on Jesus...

779
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:04,118
from the time he was born
until the time he died on Earth.

780
00:39:04,208 --> 00:39:06,745
She tried to steal my purse,
but I taught her a lesson. Here you go.

781
00:39:06,844 --> 00:39:10,291
Now you have been crowned
the Christmas- Praise. Hallelujah.

782
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:12,724
- I got her, didn't I? I got her, Bailey.
- Yes, mafam.

783
00:39:12,816 --> 00:39:15,854
'Souse me. Oliver, take me to the house.
I'm getting the hell outta here.

784
00:39:15,953 --> 00:39:17,762
We'll talk when I get back
for the Jubilee.

785
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:20,927
L_uoy. How do you even-
How did she-

786
00:39:24,361 --> 00:39:26,341
That's a woe-known' tree.

787
00:39:45,849 --> 00:39:47,328
. Hey, baby.
- Hey.

788
00:39:47,417 --> 00:39:49,419
- Are they here yet?
- Nope.

789
00:39:49,519 --> 00:39:52,090
I rushed home.
How's my mother?

790
00:39:52,189 --> 00:39:54,601
I dorft know.
She only said two Words to me.

791
00:39:54,691 --> 00:39:56,534
You think of how you're
gonna handle this yet?

792
00:39:56,627 --> 00:39:58,470
No. Were you able
to talk to your parents?

793
00:39:58,562 --> 00:40:00,041
Nope, no cell phone.

794
00:40:02,232 --> 00:40:04,872
Guess I'll have to talk to 'em now
'cause they're here.

795
00:40:07,070 --> 00:40:09,050
- Hey, hey!
' Hi, y'all!

796
00:40:09,139 --> 00:40:11,016
Hey, hey!
Look at you!

797
00:40:11,108 --> 00:40:12,815
Don't you go nowhere.

798
00:40:14,177 --> 00:40:15,815
I'm gonna get your mama.

799
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:18,655
- I look all right?
- Yeah, you look great.

800
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:20,786
- Son! Son!
- Mama! Daddy!

801
00:40:20,884 --> 00:40:22,488
Look at you!

802
00:40:23,186 --> 00:40:24,824
Daddy, not the bear hug!

803
00:40:26,223 --> 00:40:28,203
Your old man still got it, dorft he?

804
00:40:28,292 --> 00:40:30,670
Look at my Grizzly Adams.

805
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:34,038
Look at you.
You look like a mountain man.

806
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:38,004
Hey, Son, see this?
This ain't fat. This is all foreskin.

807
00:40:38,101 --> 00:40:40,172
Buddy, stop.
Don't start so early.

808
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:42,011
- You must be Lacey.
- Yes.

809
00:40:42,105 --> 00:40:43,675
Look at you!

810
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:45,412
- Oh, my!
- You put her clown.

811
00:40:45,509 --> 00:40:48,149
You dorft gotta break her
and snap her neck.

812
00:40:48,245 --> 00:40:50,418
Just give him a little nudge
to the flapjacks there.

813
00:40:50,514 --> 00:40:53,495
He'll put you down.
Where are my manners?

814
00:40:53,583 --> 00:40:56,655
I am Connefis mama.
Please call me Mrs. Williams.

815
00:40:56,753 --> 00:40:59,165
- Hi.

816
00:40:59,256 --> 00:41:02,203

Just dorft call me late for dinner.

817
00:41:02,826 --> 00:41:04,305

818
00:41:04,394 --> 00:41:06,704
- Look how pretty. She's very pretty.
- Thank you.

819
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:09,368
She is even more beautiful
than I ever could have imagined.

820
00:41:09,466 --> 00:41:11,503
Thank you.

821
00:41:11,601 --> 00:41:14,309
So nice to finally meet you.

822
00:41:14,404 --> 00:41:15,883
You too.

823
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:17,452
Look at this place.

824
00:41:17,541 --> 00:41:19,885
It is beautiful.
This place is stupendous.

825
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:23,254
My mama and daddy-
Sorry. I'm sorry.

826
00:41:23,347 --> 00:41:25,759
They just woulcfve been so proud.
Thank you.

827
00:41:25,849 --> 00:41:27,385
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Mama.

828
00:41:28,251 --> 00:41:30,527
I was so upset
when I heard you two eloped.

829
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:33,032
I thought maybe
you'd come down to Louisiana...

830
00:41:33,123 --> 00:41:35,865
and Went up the bayou
for the Swamp Manor to get hitched.

831
00:41:35,959 --> 00:41:39,236
We would have thrown you
such a shindig. You know that.

832
00:41:39,329 --> 00:41:41,309
Hey, I'm glad y'all did elope.

833
00:41:41,398 --> 00:41:43,708
You done saved me
an assload of money.

834
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,279
So I appreciate it.

835
00:41:45,369 --> 00:41:47,508
Well, you've spent enough money
on me already, Daddy.

836
00:41:47,604 --> 00:41:49,914
- I'm glad you recognize that.
- Honey, we love you.

837
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:52,044
Anything you want, my son.
Anything.

838
00:41:52,142 --> 00:41:53,382
Well-

839
00:41:53,477 --> 00:41:55,013
Have you two eaten?

840
00:41:56,847 --> 00:41:58,827
No, but-

841
00:41:59,883 --> 00:42:01,794
Good, 'cause I caught Christmas dinner.

842
00:42:01,885 --> 00:42:03,296
Caught?

843
00:42:03,387 --> 00:42:07,460
We are gonna have not possum potpie.
I'm gonna make it.

844
00:42:08,225 --> 00:42:10,227
It's good.
Nice flaky crust.

845
00:42:10,327 --> 00:42:11,806
Gonna have possum stew...

846
00:42:11,895 --> 00:42:14,432
and your uncle DeWayne
done got me some white lightning.

847
00:42:14,531 --> 00:42:16,670
Here, let me take this, Daddy.

848
00:42:16,767 --> 00:42:19,270
Actually, Lacey's a vegetarian.

849
00:42:19,369 --> 00:42:22,350
She's a vegetarianist?
On a farm.

850
00:42:22,439 --> 00:42:24,419
- Honey, that must be hard.
- That don't mean nothing.

851
00:42:24,508 --> 00:42:27,955
We's Baptist, and we still like
a nice possum stew every now and then.

852
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:31,151
No, Buddy.
It means she doesrft eat meat.

853
00:42:31,248 --> 00:42:34,422
- She doesrft eat meat.
- Oh, you're a tofu farter.

854
00:42:34,518 --> 00:42:36,498
- Daddy.
- Ain't nothing wrong with that.

855
00:42:36,586 --> 00:42:38,759
I like tofu farters.
God bless you.

856
00:42:38,855 --> 00:42:40,835
All I'm saying, Son,
if she dorft eat meat...

857
00:42:40,924 --> 00:42:44,371
that might be a bad thing when it comes
to certain parts of the anatomy.

858
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:48,407
Mama, can you please-
I'm sorry.

859
00:42:48,498 --> 00:42:50,307
We just met her.
Now, stop.

860
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,846
- Start slow, all right?
- I was just kidding.

861
00:42:52,936 --> 00:42:54,415
I'm sorry. He's crazy.

862
00:42:54,504 --> 00:42:56,575
What are we doing
standing out here getting all dusty?

863
00:42:56,673 --> 00:42:59,813
Let's go inside and get our meal on.
I'm starvin'.

864
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:02,789
I brought you some spices
from your Aunt Tutu's garden.

865
00:43:02,879 --> 00:43:04,358
- Okay. Mama-
- You're gonna love 'em.

866
00:43:04,448 --> 00:43:07,088
- Let me go get that.
- Hang on, y'all.

867
00:43:07,184 --> 00:43:09,562
Lacey's mama is cookin'.

868
00:43:10,087 --> 00:43:12,067
Lacey's ma- She's here?

869
00:43:12,155 --> 00:43:13,600
- Your mamas here now?
- Yes.

870
00:43:13,690 --> 00:43:16,102
- Her mama is here, Buddy.
- Hey, hey! All right.

871
00:43:16,193 --> 00:43:17,934
Looks like we get to meet the in-laws.

872
00:43:18,028 --> 00:43:20,304
Actually, we kind of have a problem.

873
00:43:20,397 --> 00:43:21,671
What's the problem?

874
00:43:21,765 --> 00:43:23,870
Lacey hadrft told her mama
that we're married.

875
00:43:24,568 --> 00:43:26,673
- What?
- Why airft you told her?

876
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:27,942
Well...

877
00:43:28,038 --> 00:43:30,609
my mother had dreams
for my entire life...

878
00:43:30,707 --> 00:43:33,688
and Conner was not in that dream.

879
00:43:36,179 --> 00:43:37,658
I'm sorry. I do-

880
00:43:37,747 --> 00:43:40,728
- I don't understand.
- I think I do. Let me ask you something.

881
00:43:40,817 --> 00:43:43,991
When she had them dreams,
was they in color or black-and-white?

882
00:43:48,492 --> 00:43:50,529
She doesrft Want you with a white man.

883
00:43:53,296 --> 00:43:55,640
I'm sorry. That's awful.

884
00:43:55,732 --> 00:43:57,712
Honey, we taught all of our children...

885
00:43:57,801 --> 00:43:59,974
"Never see color. Only see heart."

886
00:44:00,070 --> 00:44:03,381
- isn't that right, Conner?
- That's right.

887
00:44:03,473 --> 00:44:06,977
It's such a shame she does not know
What kind of person you are.

888
00:44:07,911 --> 00:44:09,686
I'll tell you who he is.

889
00:44:09,779 --> 00:44:12,259
Always taught him
to look at a womarfs heart.

890
00:44:12,349 --> 00:44:14,420
'Cause that's Where their rack hangs.

891
00:44:14,518 --> 00:44:15,690
Daddy.

892
00:44:15,785 --> 00:44:17,924
I'm just kiddin'.
She got a nice rack.

893
00:44:18,021 --> 00:44:19,762
Your mama
used to have a nice rack.

894
00:44:19,856 --> 00:44:22,962
Now she bends over,
just looks like she's got a 7-1 O split.

895
00:44:23,059 --> 00:44:25,505
- What the hell does that mean?
- It's a bowling term.

896
00:44:25,595 --> 00:44:27,802
- I dorft like that, Daddy.
- I dorft either.

897
00:44:27,898 --> 00:44:31,243
I'm just kiddin'. I still like to go
to the bowling alley every now and then.

898
00:44:31,334 --> 00:44:33,473
- You're sexy to me.
- Will you hush?

899
00:44:33,570 --> 00:44:36,278
I'm gonna start talking
about all your wrinkly, saggy parts.

900
00:44:36,373 --> 00:44:39,411
- It's like a turkey giblet in there.
- That was over the line.

901
00:44:41,011 --> 00:44:44,083
Well, honey, Conner,
who does she think you are?

902
00:44:44,781 --> 00:44:46,419
She thinks I'm the farm help.

903
00:44:47,450 --> 00:44:50,090
- Well, there's a switcheroo.
- The farm help.

904
00:44:50,187 --> 00:44:52,758
Do you think we should leave?
I think we should maybe leave.

905
00:44:52,856 --> 00:44:55,666
I ain't goin' nowhere.
Hell, I just drove up here.

906
00:44:55,759 --> 00:44:58,706
- I am tired. I Want a beer.
- I dorft Want you guys to leave.

907
00:44:58,795 --> 00:45:01,139
Well, What should we do?

908
00:45:02,465 --> 00:45:04,502
Can you give me
some time to tell her?

909
00:45:04,601 --> 00:45:08,413
I mean, I have to break it to her gently.
Shes been very sick.

910
00:45:08,505 --> 00:45:10,712
- Oh, no.
- I'm so sorry.

911
00:45:10,807 --> 00:45:13,219
- What's wrong?
- She has a weak heart.

912
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:15,449
Then by all means, you just...

913
00:45:15,545 --> 00:45:17,786
take your time
and tell her when you're ready.

914
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:19,724
- Thank you.
- Okay.

915
00:45:19,816 --> 00:45:22,524
We dam want her "skew
to Keck out on you here.

916
00:45:22,619 --> 00:45:24,394
- We'll behave ourselves.
- Yeah.

917
00:45:24,487 --> 00:45:26,228
- You know What we'll be?
- What?

918
00:45:26,323 --> 00:45:28,826
- Parents of the help.
- That's right. Parents of the help.

919
00:45:28,925 --> 00:45:31,872
- "Can I get you something?"
- Let's head in.

920
00:45:31,962 --> 00:45:34,272
- Come on.
- Daddy, behave.

921
00:45:34,364 --> 00:45:37,106
I'll behave.
Like a bull in a rodeo.

922
00:45:37,267 --> 00:45:39,975
- Did you paint this? This is fabulous.
- I started.

923
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:41,981
- Still needs some work.
- Where you at?

924
00:45:42,072 --> 00:45:44,074
I bet this house run them
in the double figures.

925
00:45:44,174 --> 00:45:45,551
- Hey, Madea.
- Hey!

926
00:45:45,642 --> 00:45:47,644
- This is my mama, Kim.

927
00:45:47,744 --> 00:45:49,655

928
00:45:49,746 --> 00:45:51,589
And this is my daddy, Buddy.

00:45:51,681 --> 00:45:53,388

931
00:45:55,952 --> 00:45:57,431
No, that's just my Wife.

932
00:45:58,288 --> 00:46:01,667
Forgive my husband.
He is just a horses ass and a half.

933
00:46:01,758 --> 00:46:04,671
- Wait. I smell cookin'.
- Yeah, that's Eileen.

934
00:46:04,761 --> 00:46:06,798
- Her mama was up in there cooking.
- Where is she?

935
00:46:06,896 --> 00:46:09,103
She was in the kitchen,
but she Went to the backyard.

936
00:46:09,199 --> 00:46:11,042
Come on. Sit down.
Take a load off.

937
00:46:11,134 --> 00:46:13,774
Take a load off.
Y'all sit a spell.

938
00:46:13,870 --> 00:46:16,942

939
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:18,951
I like you.
You're a nice lady.

940
00:46:19,042 --> 00:46:21,022
Don't be flirting with me
in front of your wife.

941
00:46:21,111 --> 00:46:23,785
If I put this thing on,
you worft be able to get rid of it.

942
00:46:24,814 --> 00:46:27,192
I'll have him pay my rent,
car note and everything else.

943
00:46:27,284 --> 00:46:28,854
I'm from the old school.

944
00:46:29,886 --> 00:46:31,695
Believe me, he carft help it.

945
00:46:31,788 --> 00:46:34,291
And if you can stand him,
you're Welcome to him, right?

946
00:46:34,391 --> 00:46:36,667
- Hey, Conner, get me a beer.
- Yes, sir.

947
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:38,239
Well, Miss Madea...

948
00:46:38,328 --> 00:46:41,309

Christmas dinner together this year...

949
00:46:41,398 --> 00:46:42,877
but dorft you worry.

950
00:46:42,966 --> 00:46:45,037
We could care less you're black.

951
00:46:47,337 --> 00:46:49,374
"African-American," Buddy.

952
00:46:49,472 --> 00:46:52,385
Right, Whatever.
African-American.

953
00:46:52,475 --> 00:46:54,785
That's all right. I dorft care
that y'all are white America...

954
00:46:54,878 --> 00:46:57,222
Angro- Angrola-Saxons-
Saxophonists.

955
00:46:57,314 --> 00:47:00,454
I dorft care. That dorft matter at all
that y'all Anglo-Saxophonists.

956
00:47:01,318 --> 00:47:02,820
I like her.

957
00:47:02,919 --> 00:47:05,365
She's got a good sense of humor
and those big, sturdy feet.

958
00:47:05,455 --> 00:47:08,698
You need a good sense of humor
with this group in here.

959
00:47:08,792 --> 00:47:11,272
- Here, Daddy, beer. Drink up.
- Appreciate it.

960
00:47:11,361 --> 00:47:14,535
- Please, drink up.
- I'll tell you What, Son.

961
00:47:14,631 --> 00:47:16,975
That last girl you with
was so dadgum ugly...

962
00:47:17,067 --> 00:47:19,172
my dog humped her leg
and shut his eyeballs.

963
00:47:19,269 --> 00:47:21,909
Oh, stop it. He's awful!

964
00:47:23,006 --> 00:47:26,886
"He shut his eyeballs."
That's ugly.

965
00:47:26,976 --> 00:47:30,583
Please forgive my husband.
He is a Wannabe comedian.

966
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:32,159
You are no Jeff Foxworthy.

967
00:47:32,248 --> 00:47:34,785
Well, I try to be,
but who can? Who can?

968
00:47:34,884 --> 00:47:38,058
Did you hear the one about
the two rabbis and the black dude?

969
00:47:38,154 --> 00:47:39,895
- Daddy.
- No.

970
00:47:39,989 --> 00:47:42,469
Did you hear the one about
the stray bullet that killed the redneck...

971
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:44,766
for telling the story about
the rabbis and the black dude?

972
00:47:44,861 --> 00:47:46,340
It's hilarious!

973
00:47:47,831 --> 00:47:50,107
I got him, didn't I? I got him.

974
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:53,044
- Y'all get your ass shot.
- I like her. I do.

975
00:47:54,137 --> 00:47:56,242
I do too.
She likes to hang.

976
00:47:57,941 --> 00:47:59,921
No, ain't gonna be
no hanging around here now.

977
00:48:00,009 --> 00:48:02,046
No, he didn't mean that.
He meant that-

978
00:48:02,145 --> 00:48:04,853
You calm the hell down?
You are so politically correct.

979
00:48:04,948 --> 00:48:06,757
They're having fun.
I'm having fun too.

980
00:48:06,850 --> 00:48:09,126
I wasrft offended.
Hell, I got a pistol.

981
00:48:10,153 --> 00:48:12,497
I knew she knew that.
Let me ask you this.

982
00:48:12,589 --> 00:48:14,068
Do you know Oprah?

983
00:48:14,157 --> 00:48:15,966
Honey, I told you...

984
00:48:16,059 --> 00:48:18,471
all black folk
dorft necessarily know each other.

985
00:48:18,561 --> 00:48:23,601
- Coulcfve fooled me.
- Do I look like Paul Bunyan or What?

986
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:27,614
Actually, you sure in the hell do.
And the Jolly Green Giant too. Ho-ho-ho.

987
00:48:28,371 --> 00:48:31,045
- Farmhand, please help me.
- His name is Conner.

988
00:48:31,141 --> 00:48:32,176
Whew!

989
00:48:32,275 --> 00:48:34,312
I think the tree...

990
00:48:34,411 --> 00:48:36,391
would look good right here.

991
00:48:36,479 --> 00:48:38,652
If you dorft mind me butting in...

992
00:48:38,748 --> 00:48:42,093
I think it would look really pretty
right here by the Window...

993
00:48:42,185 --> 00:48:44,859
and that Way
all the passersby can enjoy it.

994
00:48:44,954 --> 00:48:47,525
That's Where we had it every year.

995
00:48:47,624 --> 00:48:50,104
- And who are you?
- That's a pretty tree.

996
00:48:50,193 --> 00:48:52,366
I am- I'm Connefis mom.

997
00:48:52,462 --> 00:48:55,841
That's Kim and that's Buddy.
These are Coronefis parents.

998
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,209
This is Eileen. I wanna scream.
I mean, Eileen.

999
00:49:00,303 --> 00:49:05,275
Trees are for the family,
not for strangers.

1000
00:49:05,375 --> 00:49:07,377
What the hell
these people doing here?

1001
00:49:07,477 --> 00:49:10,458
Mama, they came
to visit Conner for Christmas.

1002
00:49:11,681 --> 00:49:16,653
Really?
That is just like my daughter.

1003
00:49:16,753 --> 00:49:18,357
I raised you right.

1004
00:49:18,455 --> 00:49:22,904
My daughter has always been good
with helping the help.

1005
00:49:22,992 --> 00:49:25,029
Yes.

1006
00:49:25,128 --> 00:49:27,836
- Where you staying?
- We're thinking of staying here.

1007
00:49:27,931 --> 00:49:30,571
Yeah. We drove all the way up
from Louisiana...

1008
00:49:30,667 --> 00:49:33,204
to spend Christmas
with Conner and Lacey.

1009
00:49:34,304 --> 00:49:37,114
It'll be a little cramped...

1010
00:49:37,974 --> 00:49:39,612
but we'll make do.

1011
00:49:41,611 --> 00:49:44,387
Madea and I will share a room.

1012
00:49:44,481 --> 00:49:46,688
You, Buddy and-

1013
00:49:46,783 --> 00:49:47,853
Kim.

1014
00:49:47,951 --> 00:49:50,227
Kim, take another room...

1015
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:52,163
- and Carver-
- Conner.

1016
00:49:52,255 --> 00:49:53,563
- That's What I said.
- Conner.

1017
00:49:53,656 --> 00:49:56,068
Yes, Carver,
you can take the sofa.

1018
00:49:57,260 --> 00:49:59,638
Let me get some decorations.

1019
00:49:59,729 --> 00:50:02,232
Okay. I just-

1020
00:50:02,332 --> 00:50:05,711
So many memories
just coming back to me bein' here.

1021
00:50:05,802 --> 00:50:09,773
To tell you, Lacey, my mama,
she loved this place. She did.

1022
00:50:09,873 --> 00:50:12,854
I'm so happy you all
came back here to take care of it.

1023
00:50:12,942 --> 00:50:14,250
Welcome.

1024
00:50:15,278 --> 00:50:17,417
Well, my daughtefis
paying the mortgage...

1025
00:50:17,514 --> 00:50:19,755
so I hope you bring in
a crop this year.

1026
00:50:19,849 --> 00:50:22,261
I told you not to buy this farm.

1027
00:50:22,352 --> 00:50:26,300
That dam up north caused a lot
of problems this year for the farmers.

1028
00:50:26,389 --> 00:50:29,996
But Conner, he's got him
a new strain of corn that takes less water.

1029
00:50:30,093 --> 00:50:31,731
Now, how's that work, Conner?

1030
00:50:31,828 --> 00:50:35,298
I studied agriculture
at New York State.

1031
00:50:35,398 --> 00:50:36,934
Is that Where you two met?

1032
00:50:37,033 --> 00:50:38,671
Yeah. He's brilliant.

1033
00:50:38,768 --> 00:50:41,578
Gets it from his old man.
Runs in the genes.

1034
00:50:41,671 --> 00:50:44,948
At the science of it,
not so much the farming.

1035
00:50:45,041 --> 00:50:48,318
So genius, little Einstein,
little Stephen Hawkins.

1036
00:50:48,411 --> 00:50:51,415
We used to call him "Smarty Britches"
when he was little.

1037
00:50:51,514 --> 00:50:55,257
If you put some Viagra
in that tree's water, it'll stay up all year.

1038
00:50:55,351 --> 00:50:59,060
You better put some Viagra in your water.
See What happen with your tree.

1039
00:51:02,492 --> 00:51:05,837
- All right, let's decorate.
- No, thank you. I can manage.

1040
00:51:05,929 --> 00:51:08,739
I brought some decorations
from Atlanta...

1041
00:51:08,831 --> 00:51:11,175
and I work at one of the finest
department stores...

1042
00:51:11,267 --> 00:51:13,508
so I know a thing or two about taste.

1043
00:51:13,603 --> 00:51:15,082
Where-

1044
00:51:15,605 --> 00:51:17,585
Where did you get this tree?

1045
00:51:17,674 --> 00:51:19,813
I mean, you have
a beautiful Christmas tree...

1046
00:51:19,909 --> 00:51:23,322
right outside the kitchen Window
and none in the house.

1047
00:51:25,615 --> 00:51:27,094
What's wrong?

1048
00:51:27,784 --> 00:51:29,855
Please dorft tell me
that's your granddaddyé tree.

1049
00:51:29,953 --> 00:51:31,455
Oh, dear God.

1050
00:51:31,554 --> 00:51:34,626
Mama, was there a yellow ribbon
wrapped around that tree?

1051
00:51:34,724 --> 00:51:36,465
Yes, and I out it off.

1052
00:51:38,061 --> 00:51:40,439
Excuse me. Excuse me.

1053
00:51:40,530 --> 00:51:42,134
What happened? What?

1054
00:51:43,232 --> 00:51:45,269
My mama planted that tree...

1055
00:51:45,368 --> 00:51:47,746
in memory of my granddaddy.

1056
00:51:51,941 --> 00:51:54,148
Well, how was I supposed to know that?

1057
00:51:54,243 --> 00:51:55,984
This doesrft make
any sense. Lacey.

1058
00:51:56,079 --> 00:52:00,027
Did these people come
when you bought this land?

1059
00:52:00,116 --> 00:52:03,893
This is your land now.
You can do What you Want to with it.

1060
00:52:04,654 --> 00:52:06,395
Excuse me.

1061
00:52:06,489 --> 00:52:07,968
You dorft look so good.

1062
00:52:08,057 --> 00:52:10,298
Feeling a little light-headed.

1063
00:52:10,393 --> 00:52:12,304
Well, sit clown then. Sit clown.

1064
00:52:12,395 --> 00:52:13,703
Okay.

1065
00:52:15,632 --> 00:52:18,374
It's all these strange people
in this house, that's What it is.

1066
00:52:18,468 --> 00:52:20,573
It ain't them people, it's you!
Hell, you!

1067
00:52:20,670 --> 00:52:23,742
You lost your damn mind.
You done lost your damn mind!

1068
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:27,515
Anytime you see somebody with
a yellow ribbon on the tree, Eileen...

1069
00:52:27,610 --> 00:52:30,250
a yellow ribbon,
that means a memoriam.

1070
00:52:30,346 --> 00:52:31,552
Don't you know what that means?

1071
00:52:31,648 --> 00:52:34,026
Everybody in the USA
knows What a memoriam is...

1072
00:52:34,117 --> 00:52:36,119
when you see a yellow ribbon
on a damn tree.

1073
00:52:36,219 --> 00:52:37,789
You work on my nerves.

1074
00:52:37,887 --> 00:52:41,198
That poor Woman is probably crying
'cause you out down her daddyé tree.

1075
00:52:41,290 --> 00:52:43,270
What wrong with you,
cutting clown her claclcly's tree?

1076
00:52:43,359 --> 00:52:45,430
You know whafs gonna happen?
I'm gonna make this plain.

1077
00:52:45,528 --> 00:52:47,439
You're gonna go to bed,
slip into a coma...

1078
00:52:47,530 --> 00:52:49,271
and everybody gonna wonder
What happened to you.

1079
00:52:49,365 --> 00:52:51,845
I did it.
It's Christmas, damn it!

1080
00:52:52,035 --> 00:52:54,982
I don't know, Buddy.
I don't think I can deal with this.

1081
00:52:55,071 --> 00:52:57,415
I dorft like it. it's wrong.

1082
00:52:57,507 --> 00:53:01,512
I carft pretend to be somebody.
I'm not an actress. I'm not Reba.

1083
00:53:01,611 --> 00:53:04,387
Maybe we should just leave.
Let's pack up and leave tomorrow.

1084
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:06,391
No, we're not going back home.
We're staying here.

1085
00:53:06,482 --> 00:53:08,052
- It's Christmas.
- And that woman...

1086
00:53:08,151 --> 00:53:11,963
she cuts down my daddye memory tree
and acts like she doesrft even care!

1087
00:53:12,055 --> 00:53:14,035
Honey, I know.
It stinks. I get it.

1088
00:53:14,123 --> 00:53:16,103
You know What?
We'll get you another tree.

1089
00:53:16,192 --> 00:53:19,230
I want that tree. I want my claclcly's tree.
What about our son?

1090
00:53:19,328 --> 00:53:21,899
Connerjust stands there and doesrft
say anything back to this woman.

1091
00:53:21,998 --> 00:53:24,979
He's just pretending,
just saying 00277;)?' to this woman.

1092
00:53:25,068 --> 00:53:28,845
Sweetheart, you know our kid.
He carft tell no to anybody.

1093
00:53:28,938 --> 00:53:30,417
Let him figure it out.

1094
00:53:30,506 --> 00:53:32,247
- You Want some of this?
- No, not now.

1095
00:53:32,341 --> 00:53:35,481
- You know you Want some of this.
- I dorft. it's too much for me.

1096
00:53:35,578 --> 00:53:37,489
Remember that game
we played when we was kicls?

1097
00:53:37,580 --> 00:53:39,560
- Mystery Date?
- No, the Ghost and the Damsel.

1098
00:53:39,649 --> 00:53:41,629
- You remember that?
- Buddy Williams...

1099
00:53:41,718 --> 00:53:44,756
We are not playing- This is not
the time or the place. Dorft you dare.

1100
00:53:44,854 --> 00:53:47,130
Go take a cold shower
and get off of me.

1101
00:53:47,223 --> 00:53:49,100
Go throw some milk on that thing.

1102
00:53:49,192 --> 00:53:51,672
I think I left my bag in-

1103
00:53:52,729 --> 00:53:54,709
one of my bags here.

1104
00:54:00,303 --> 00:54:02,249
- You think she noticed me?
- Yes!

1105
00:54:02,338 --> 00:54:04,875
- Yes!
- Oh, damn.

1106
00:54:07,777 --> 00:54:11,190
How to stop diabetes before it starts.
That's what AARP talking about.

1107
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:13,260
You got to read this,
this is pretty good.

1108
00:54:23,192 --> 00:54:24,671
Eileen, What you doin?

1109
00:54:24,761 --> 00:54:26,263
I knew it.

1110
00:54:26,362 --> 00:54:28,535
He's in the Ku Klux Klan.

1111
00:54:28,631 --> 00:54:30,110
What?

1112
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:34,307
He was wearing the sheet
when I Went in the room.

1113
00:54:34,403 --> 00:54:36,349
Them people
are not in no Ku Klux Klan.

1114
00:54:36,439 --> 00:54:38,214
I saw the Klan today.
That ain't the Klan.

1115
00:54:38,307 --> 00:54:41,811
- They probably trying to make up the bed.
- I know the Klan when I see it.

1116
00:54:41,911 --> 00:54:44,289
There you go, overreacting,
like you always do.

1117
00:54:44,380 --> 00:54:46,758
- Yes, he is.
- Always jump to conclusions.

1118
00:54:47,617 --> 00:54:49,028
Stop jumping to conclusions.

1119
00:54:49,118 --> 00:54:51,428
No, baby. No.

1120
00:54:52,121 --> 00:54:53,600
I know What I saw.

1121
00:54:53,689 --> 00:54:55,726
Eileen, you gonna
get your pressure up.

1122
00:54:55,825 --> 00:55:00,365
I'm gonna sleep
with one eye open tonight.

1123
00:55:00,463 --> 00:55:04,707
Yes. Oh, Lord,
my poor daughter, she's so naive.

1124
00:55:04,801 --> 00:55:07,577
She dorft know whafs going on.
She dorft have a clue.

1125
00:55:07,670 --> 00:55:10,480
You don't have a clue, talkin' about
sleeping with one eye open.

1126
00:55:10,573 --> 00:55:13,247
I hope ifs not the lazy one,
'cause that one always look closed.

1127
00:55:13,342 --> 00:55:15,151
Them people are not in the Klan.

1128
00:55:15,244 --> 00:55:17,417
You put all of this stuff
in front of that door.

1129
00:55:17,513 --> 00:55:19,151
All that stuff in front the damn door.

1130
00:55:19,248 --> 00:55:22,491
I go to the bathroom, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine, 10, 12 times a night...

1131
00:55:22,585 --> 00:55:24,496
and if I laugh too hard,
I squirt pee.

1132
00:55:24,587 --> 00:55:26,294
You got to move that stuff.

1133
00:55:26,389 --> 00:55:29,666
How can I go to the bathroom
at night with all that in front the cloor?

1134
00:55:32,595 --> 00:55:34,302
What this?

1135
00:55:34,397 --> 00:55:37,071
- I carft sit on this cup!
- Then stand up.

1136
00:56:16,105 --> 00:56:17,584
Conner, I'm sorry.

1137
00:56:17,673 --> 00:56:20,119
- Can I ask you something?
- Whats that?

1138
00:56:22,311 --> 00:56:24,882
- Are you ashamed of me?
- No.

1139
00:56:24,981 --> 00:56:27,120
Then why worft you tell her?

1140
00:56:27,216 --> 00:56:31,289
I've never let my mother clown
my entire life. Okay?

1141
00:56:31,387 --> 00:56:35,301
I've done everything
she wanted. Always.

1142
00:56:35,391 --> 00:56:38,235
And this is the first time
I've done something that I waht.

1143
00:56:39,862 --> 00:56:41,933
Conner, ifs gonna break her heart.

1144
00:56:42,031 --> 00:56:43,510
You gotta understand that.

1145
00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:46,102
You have to understand
how this makes me feel.

1146
00:56:46,202 --> 00:56:49,581
I love you. I'm proud of us.
I dorft care who knows.

1147
00:56:53,843 --> 00:56:56,915
- Are you coming to bed?
- You mean the sofa, right?

1148
00:56:57,613 --> 00:57:00,025
You know the walls are thin.

1149
00:57:00,116 --> 00:57:02,221
My patience
is getting there with this.

1150
00:57:11,227 --> 00:57:14,174
And I told her, "You better
get the hell oh out the way."

1151
00:57:14,263 --> 00:57:16,539
l_orcl, that was funny.
Your mama was something else.

1152
00:57:16,632 --> 00:57:18,270
Here you are, Miss Murphy.

1153
00:57:19,735 --> 00:57:21,942
Three little eggs.

1154
00:57:22,038 --> 00:57:23,745
Mama, ifs fine.

1155
00:57:24,774 --> 00:57:26,481
Would you like some coffee, Conner?

1156
00:57:26,575 --> 00:57:29,522
No, I gotta tend to the animals.

1157
00:57:33,316 --> 00:57:35,660
I can give you a few pointers
if you want to.

1158
00:57:35,751 --> 00:57:37,662
- Yeah, that would be great.
- Okay, great.

1159
00:57:37,753 --> 00:57:39,733
All right.
I'll be outside if y'all need me.

1160
00:57:40,423 --> 00:57:43,063
What kind of farmhand

1161
00:57:43,159 --> 00:57:45,969
- He knows the science of it, Mama.
- No, I heard that last night.

1162
00:57:46,062 --> 00:57:48,406
Wait. Why are you
always defending him?

1163
00:57:48,497 --> 00:57:50,977
'Cause she like him.

1164
00:57:52,501 --> 00:57:55,243
Over my dead body will she end up
with somebody like that.

1165
00:57:55,338 --> 00:57:56,749
Somebody like What?

1166
00:57:57,640 --> 00:58:01,213
I dorft wanna talk about it.
We dorft make those kind of jokes, okay?

1167
00:58:01,310 --> 00:58:03,347
Hush up, Dragon Lady.
Hush the hell up.

1168
00:58:03,446 --> 00:58:06,825
If she like him, she like him.
That's all that is. Just hush.

1169
00:58:06,916 --> 00:58:08,725
Excuse me.
Good morning, y'all.

1170
00:58:08,818 --> 00:58:12,231
This room brings back
so many memories.

1171
00:58:12,321 --> 00:58:14,198
Smells like farm.

1172
00:58:14,290 --> 00:58:15,769
Good morning, Miss Mandela.

1173
00:58:15,858 --> 00:58:17,735
Not Mandela, honey. Madea.

1174
00:58:18,761 --> 00:58:21,071
Madea, honey.
Hi, sweetheart.

1175
00:58:21,163 --> 00:58:23,109
Mrs. Williams,
would you like some coffee?

1176
00:58:23,199 --> 00:58:26,442
- I'm gonna get it myself.
- Don't you have to go to school?

1177
00:58:26,535 --> 00:58:29,709
Actually, I do. I'm on my Way.
I'll talk to you later.

1178
00:58:29,805 --> 00:58:31,307
Bye, Miss Mandela.

1179
00:58:32,108 --> 00:58:35,146
I had such a crazy,
crazy-ass dream last night.

1180
00:58:35,244 --> 00:58:37,246
- Really?
- Yeah. What are you cooking?

1181
00:58:37,346 --> 00:58:40,293
- Can I help? I'm good in the kitchen.
- No, I dorft need your help.

1182
00:58:40,383 --> 00:58:41,259
Eileen!

1183
00:58:42,284 --> 00:58:44,355
What? I dorft need her help.

1184
00:58:45,888 --> 00:58:49,358
I understand. I like to cook alone
myself sometimes too.

1185
00:58:49,458 --> 00:58:50,937
- Thank you.
- All right then.

1186
00:58:51,027 --> 00:58:52,062
- Thank you.
- Okay.

1187
00:58:52,762 --> 00:58:54,241
You oughta be ashamed of yourself.

1188
00:58:54,330 --> 00:58:56,310
That ain't being Christian,
being that mean to that woman.

1189
00:58:56,399 --> 00:58:58,936
I dorft eat food from the KKK.

1190
00:58:59,635 --> 00:59:02,707
That Woman ain't in no KKK.
Hush that foolishness. Hell.

1191
00:59:02,805 --> 00:59:05,081
- I love you, Son.
- Love you too.

1192
00:59:05,174 --> 00:59:06,676
Stay warm, okay?

1193
00:59:13,716 --> 00:59:16,697
- Stop babying him.
- You need to start babying him.

1194
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:19,393
What's the matter with you?

1195
00:59:19,488 --> 00:59:22,094
You did not need to be so mean
to that Woman yesterday.

1196
00:59:22,191 --> 00:59:24,398
She dorft need to be
coming around here.

1197
00:59:24,493 --> 00:59:27,337
She seems nice.
She just wants the best for Bailey.

1198
00:59:27,430 --> 00:59:30,070
I know whafs the best for Bailey,
and that's keeping this place running.

1199
00:59:30,166 --> 00:59:31,804
He can learn something in school.

1200
00:59:31,901 --> 00:59:34,347
Maybe become something
more than the two of us.

1201
00:59:34,437 --> 00:59:37,213
Yeah? Well, school
is gonna have to wait.

1202
00:59:38,874 --> 00:59:40,683
Gotta get these "poinsetters" sold.

1203
00:59:40,776 --> 00:59:44,121
Think I'm gonna go clown to Harrisburg.
Try sell 'em over there.

1204
00:59:44,213 --> 00:59:47,057
If you would have talked to Lacey,
you woulcfve found out...

1205
00:59:47,149 --> 00:59:50,289
that she has got sponsorship
for the Jubilee, so it is happening.

1206
00:59:50,386 --> 00:59:52,764
So you can sell your poinsettias
at the Jubilee.

1207
00:59:52,855 --> 00:59:54,960
- Whds the sponsor?
- I dorft know.

1208
00:59:58,427 --> 01:00:00,498
Who does she think she is?

1209
01:00:00,596 --> 01:00:02,598
What you mad for, huh?

1210
01:00:02,698 --> 01:00:04,700
The Jubilee is happening.

1211
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:07,838
We doh't need her help.
She aih't from around here.

1212
01:00:07,937 --> 01:00:11,180
- Well, that's just plain dumb.
- You watch your back talk, Amber.

1213
01:00:11,273 --> 01:00:13,549
And you watch your front talk, Tanner.

1214
01:00:19,081 --> 01:00:20,583
- Hi.
- Hey.

1215
01:00:21,283 --> 01:00:22,921
Heard about the sponsorship?

1216
01:00:23,786 --> 01:00:25,766
Yeah, just found out about it.

1217
01:00:25,855 --> 01:00:28,335
- We got a problem.
- What's that?

1218
01:00:28,424 --> 01:00:30,563
Sponsor is Sheldon Construction.

1219
01:00:34,130 --> 01:00:36,872
Same Sheldon Construction that built
the dam that put us all out of business?

1220
01:00:36,966 --> 01:00:40,277
- That's the one.
- Hell no. You see?

1221
01:00:41,470 --> 01:00:42,949
Unbelievable.

1222
01:00:47,243 --> 01:00:49,849
Child, these nipples so tough,
you need a mammogram.

1223
01:00:50,446 --> 01:00:52,483
Don't look at me like that.

1224
01:00:53,182 --> 01:00:55,184
- But you giving milk.
- Well, hello.

1225
01:00:56,085 --> 01:00:57,564
Hey there.

1226
01:00:58,888 --> 01:01:01,391
- How are you?
- Thems pigs was starving to death.

1227
01:01:01,490 --> 01:01:04,198
I slopped them, and I've been
trying to get milk for Eileen.

1228
01:01:04,293 --> 01:01:06,739
- She's in there trying to cook something.
- Look, he's trying.

1229
01:01:06,829 --> 01:01:09,935
- We sure do appreciate you helpin'.
- No. That's fine.

1230
01:01:10,032 --> 01:01:13,070
I'll show him how to do it when he
come out of that laboratory thing.

1231
01:01:13,169 --> 01:01:15,706
Look like he growing marijuana.
He ain't growing marijuana, is he?

1232
01:01:15,804 --> 01:01:18,683
No, he ain't doing that.
Look, he's a smart kid, you know.

1233
01:01:18,774 --> 01:01:20,981
He just, well-

1234
01:01:22,344 --> 01:01:24,255
- What?
- I'm a truck driver.

1235
01:01:24,346 --> 01:01:26,826
I'm out on the road a lot,
you know, and...

1236
01:01:26,916 --> 01:01:30,090
he always stayed with his mom
and his grandparents here.

1237
01:01:30,186 --> 01:01:33,258
I tell you What, it broke my heart
to be gone so much...

1238
01:01:33,355 --> 01:01:37,462
but I just kind of feel a little guilty
about the Way he turned out.

1239
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:40,040
- How he turn out?
- Kind of passive, I guess.

1240
01:01:40,129 --> 01:01:42,336
Kind of lets people
Walk all over him.

1241
01:01:42,431 --> 01:01:46,538
I mean, he used to get beat up
a lot in school, bullied.

1242
01:01:46,635 --> 01:01:48,308
- Oh, he's soft.
- He's soft.

1243
01:01:48,404 --> 01:01:50,941
This kid, Tanner,
used to beat him up all the time.

1244
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:52,951
And he still lives here, that Tanner.

1245
01:01:53,042 --> 01:01:55,648
When a person gets tired of a bully,
they handle it, you understand?

1246
01:01:55,744 --> 01:01:59,191
You shut it down and you realize
that you ain't gonna deal with it no more.

1247
01:01:59,281 --> 01:02:01,887
- Boy, that's the truth.
- Gotta wait for that.

1248
01:02:01,984 --> 01:02:04,328
Hey, we were
just talking about you.

1249
01:02:04,420 --> 01:02:05,899
- Yeah?
- It was all good stuff.

1250
01:02:05,988 --> 01:02:07,968
- All good stuff.
- Good.

1251
01:02:08,057 --> 01:02:10,594
That one,
she just will not let you milk her.

1252
01:02:12,061 --> 01:02:14,166
- The black-and-white one?
- Yep.

1253
01:02:16,398 --> 01:02:19,902
There's a reason why you couldrft get milk
from the black-and-white one, son.

1254
01:02:22,037 --> 01:02:24,574
If somebody pull on your testicles,
will you give 'em milk?

1255
01:02:25,841 --> 01:02:26,945
Don't answer that.

1256
01:02:27,042 --> 01:02:29,750
That's a bull.
You carft milk no bull.

1257
01:02:29,845 --> 01:02:31,825
You serious, trying to milk a bull?

1258
01:02:33,048 --> 01:02:34,118
Blessed.

1259
01:02:35,384 --> 01:02:37,921
Son, you got to slop them pigs
early in the morning.

1260
01:02:38,020 --> 01:02:41,433
Then you gotta milk these cows
'cause they nipples is tough.

1261
01:02:41,523 --> 01:02:44,129
And you carft be gentle.
You got to pull them nipples.

1262
01:02:44,226 --> 01:02:46,297
You got to pull them things.
Pull 'em hard.

1263
01:02:46,395 --> 01:02:48,841
Pull 'em. Pull 'em. Pull 'em.

1264
01:02:48,931 --> 01:02:53,209
You're used to that. Hell, his mama
breast-fed him until he was in ninth grade.

1265
01:02:54,303 --> 01:02:57,750
Shut your mouth! Ninth grade?
Her nipples ought to have corrosion.

1266
01:02:58,440 --> 01:03:00,818
Yeah. That's right.
You ought to see them things.

1267
01:03:00,909 --> 01:03:03,082
They look like cake decorator bags.

1268
01:03:03,178 --> 01:03:06,057
Dad, stop it.
Come on.

1269
01:03:06,148 --> 01:03:09,755
Y'all, sometimes I just think
I'm not out out for this.

1270
01:03:09,852 --> 01:03:13,163
Well, hey, it's just a nipple!

1271
01:03:13,856 --> 01:03:15,767
Daddy, I'm talking about farming.

1272
01:03:15,858 --> 01:03:17,667
Well, hey, farmings hard, Son.

1273
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:19,569
Yes, farmings hard.
You know What else is hard?

1274
01:03:20,329 --> 01:03:21,637
Keeping up a lie...

1275
01:03:21,730 --> 01:03:24,370
'cause the longer you let it live,
the harder it is to kill.

1276
01:03:24,466 --> 01:03:26,275
- Ain't that right?
- You got that right.

1277
01:03:26,368 --> 01:03:28,211
You're a smart woman.

1278
01:03:28,304 --> 01:03:31,217
- What are you talkin' about?
- What am I talkin' about?

1279
01:03:31,307 --> 01:03:33,116
I'm talking about you and Lacey.

1280
01:03:33,208 --> 01:03:35,347
You wanna tell Eileen, or you Want me
to tell her y'all together?

1281
01:03:35,444 --> 01:03:37,481
- Daddy!
- Hey, I didn't say nothin'.

1282
01:03:38,180 --> 01:03:39,853
- Who told you?
- You just did.

1283
01:03:39,948 --> 01:03:41,985
Whole body language.
Tensed up.

1284
01:03:42,084 --> 01:03:44,496
When I walked in the house
the other clay, I saw them shoes.

1285
01:03:44,586 --> 01:03:46,930
I see the Way you look at her,
the Way she look at you.

1286
01:03:47,022 --> 01:03:49,559
- Y'all need to say something.
- It's not me. I wanna tell her.

1287
01:03:49,658 --> 01:03:52,571
It's Lacey. She says
she doesrft think she can handle it.

1288
01:03:52,661 --> 01:03:54,902
We just need a defibrillator.
She gonna have a heart attack.

1289
01:03:54,997 --> 01:03:56,635
She gonna clutch the pearls and die.

1290
01:03:56,732 --> 01:03:58,803
But we'll get a defibrillator.
Shell be all right.

1291
01:03:58,901 --> 01:04:00,881
But ifs all right.
Y'all just dating.

1292
01:04:01,804 --> 01:04:02,839
Dating?

1293
01:04:04,573 --> 01:04:06,052
They're married.

1294
01:04:06,675 --> 01:04:08,086
Oh, she dead.

1295
01:04:08,944 --> 01:04:10,252
Flatline. Just-

1296
01:04:11,980 --> 01:04:14,586
Dead. Lord have mercy,
that's going to kill her.

1297
01:04:14,683 --> 01:04:17,027
Lacey said she's gonna tell her
on Christmas.

1298
01:04:17,119 --> 01:04:19,030
She fixin' to kill her mama
on Christmas Day?

1299
01:04:19,121 --> 01:04:21,624
- What kind of Christmas present is that?
- Oh, damn.

1300
01:04:22,658 --> 01:04:24,638
Y'all better have
some nitroglycerin or something.

1301
01:04:24,727 --> 01:04:26,707
That's a damn shame.
Gonna kill that Woman on-

1302
01:04:26,795 --> 01:04:28,775
Hell, I'm stuck in the mud.

1303
01:04:31,467 --> 01:04:32,775
Hell, this airft mud!

1304
01:04:32,868 --> 01:04:35,314
- You all right?
- I done fell in bull-

1305
01:04:39,508 --> 01:04:42,079
Keep going.
Help each other out.

1306
01:04:43,612 --> 01:04:46,024
- Hi. What's going on?
- It's bad.

1307
01:04:46,115 --> 01:04:47,924
Oliver called and told the mayor...

1308
01:04:48,016 --> 01:04:52,021
that we ooulcln't have any references
to the nativity or Jesus.

1309
01:04:52,121 --> 01:04:54,863
- What?
- The sponsors dorft Want it.

1310
01:04:54,957 --> 01:04:57,563
No. No, something is wrong.
I'll call him.

1311
01:04:57,659 --> 01:04:59,639
Well, the mayor wants to see you now.

1312
01:05:00,863 --> 01:05:02,672
- Come on.
- Okay.

1313
01:05:03,932 --> 01:05:05,570
Who does he think he is?

1314
01:05:07,369 --> 01:05:09,144
All right! That's enough!

1315
01:05:09,238 --> 01:05:11,411
That's enough!

1316
01:05:11,507 --> 01:05:13,248
One at a time!

1317
01:05:13,342 --> 01:05:14,980
I'm very upset.

1318
01:05:15,077 --> 01:05:17,489
She is trying
to take Christ out of Christmas.

1319
01:05:17,579 --> 01:05:20,321
Next thing you know
they'll wanna take prayer out of church!

1320
01:05:20,416 --> 01:05:22,396
You see What happened
when they took prayer out of schools.

1321
01:05:22,484 --> 01:05:23,462
We did.

1322
01:05:23,552 --> 01:05:25,828
Wilbur, What does it say?

1323
01:05:25,921 --> 01:05:29,459
Well, the contract says...
no nativity.

1324
01:05:29,558 --> 01:05:32,095
No Jesus reference whatsoever.

1325
01:05:32,194 --> 01:05:34,606
Not even a little drummer boy.

1326
01:05:34,696 --> 01:05:36,175
Unbelievable.

1327
01:05:36,265 --> 01:05:38,267
Why didn't it say that
the first time you read it?

1328
01:05:38,367 --> 01:05:40,540
Well, it was in the small print.

1329
01:05:40,636 --> 01:05:42,616
I didn't have my glasses on.

1330
01:05:42,704 --> 01:05:45,150
I didn't have my glasses on!
I couldrft see!

1331
01:05:45,240 --> 01:05:46,981
- This is awful!
- Wait.

1332
01:05:47,075 --> 01:05:49,055
This has got to be a mistake.

1333
01:05:49,778 --> 01:05:51,883
Let me call Oliver.
How about that?

1334
01:05:51,980 --> 01:05:54,290
All righty.
You go right ahead.

1335
01:05:54,383 --> 01:05:56,522
I've already talked to him about this,
but have at it.

1336
01:05:56,618 --> 01:05:57,926
Okay.

1337
01:05:58,954 --> 01:06:00,865
- Put it on speaker.
- Yeah.

1338
01:06:01,457 --> 01:06:02,936
Okay.

1339
01:06:11,900 --> 01:06:13,311
Hello?

1340
01:06:13,402 --> 01:06:16,713
» Hi, Oliver.
- Hey. Guess you tanked to the mayor.

1341
01:06:16,805 --> 01:06:19,877
Yes, we are all here
on speakerphone.

1342
01:06:19,975 --> 01:06:22,182
Yeah, I don't see
what the big deal is.

1343
01:06:22,277 --> 01:06:25,087
They Want it to be called Holiday Jubilee
instead of Christmas.

1344
01:06:25,180 --> 01:06:27,387
Yeah, and they dorft need references
to religious figures.

1345
01:06:27,483 --> 01:06:30,396
How clo we talk about Christmas
without talking about Jesus?

1346
01:06:30,486 --> 01:06:32,727
» Yeah, how do we?
- It happens all the time.

1347
01:06:32,821 --> 01:06:34,801
Santa Claus is okay.

1348
01:06:34,890 --> 01:06:37,461
Make it about Santa Claus
and not about the birth of Christ.

1349
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:42,836
And the songs for the Jubilee
should be about everything but Christ.

1350
01:06:42,931 --> 01:06:46,105
Sing songs like Here Comes Santa C/aus,
White Christmas.

1351
01:06:46,201 --> 01:06:47,646
White Christmas.

1352
01:06:47,736 --> 01:06:50,649
There ain't nothing white about
a Bucktussle, Alabama Christmas!

1353
01:06:50,739 --> 01:06:52,480
- It dorft snow here!
- That's right.

1354
01:06:52,574 --> 01:06:55,646
Okay, Oliver, we did not
sign up for this. Okay?

1355
01:06:55,744 --> 01:06:57,223
Yes, you did.

1356
01:06:57,312 --> 01:06:59,417
I am a Christian,
and this is some bull-

1357
01:07:03,118 --> 01:07:05,394
The heads of the company
are coming down on a private jet-

1358
01:07:05,487 --> 01:07:06,625
A private jet.

1359
01:07:06,722 --> 01:07:08,463
To be filmed with the school
at the Jubilee.

1360
01:07:08,557 --> 01:07:10,594
I did you a favor here,
and this will ruin me.

1361
01:07:10,692 --> 01:07:12,603
You carft do this to me now.

1362
01:07:12,694 --> 01:07:16,767
I can't just turn them around.
You have to figure this one out.

1363
01:07:16,865 --> 01:07:19,277
- You hold on there, son.
- That's right. You get it straight.

1364
01:07:19,368 --> 01:07:22,281
With all due respect, Mr. Mayor,
you got the money and we have a deal.

1365
01:07:22,371 --> 01:07:24,351
- Give him his money back.
- Yeah.

1366
01:07:24,439 --> 01:07:25,918
- We spent it.
- Yeah.

1367
01:07:26,008 --> 01:07:27,646
- On What?
- The Jubilee!

1368
01:07:27,743 --> 01:07:31,316
And much-needed school supplies.
And catching up on school bills.

1369
01:07:31,413 --> 01:07:34,223
Listen, I'm sorry, but we're coming.

1370
01:07:34,316 --> 01:07:36,660
This is my career you're talking about.

1371
01:07:36,752 --> 01:07:38,231
I'll see you tomorrow

1372
01:07:38,921 --> 01:07:41,060
Move, move.
Now, watch out.

1373
01:07:41,156 --> 01:07:45,195
Well, now this is a fine mess
you've gotten us into.

1374
01:07:45,294 --> 01:07:46,773
She should be fired.

1375
01:07:46,862 --> 01:07:49,138
- Now hold on a second.
- Mr. Mayor...

1376
01:07:49,231 --> 01:07:50,710
have you heard?

1377
01:07:50,799 --> 01:07:52,779
We were talking about
the changes they Want made.

1378
01:07:52,868 --> 01:07:56,475
That's not what I was talking about.
I was talking about the sponsor.

1379
01:07:57,372 --> 01:07:59,283
- Sheldon Construction.
- What?

1380
01:07:59,374 --> 01:08:00,853
That's right.

1381
01:08:00,943 --> 01:08:02,422
The same folks...

1382
01:08:02,511 --> 01:08:05,754
that built a dam to save Jasper
and left us Without a river.

1383
01:08:05,847 --> 01:08:07,849
She brought this mess here
and she should be fired.

1384
01:08:07,950 --> 01:08:09,759
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to bring-

1385
01:08:09,851 --> 01:08:13,526
We dorft care What the hell
you meant. Do we?

1386
01:08:13,622 --> 01:08:15,124
- No.
- I didn't think so.

1387
01:08:15,223 --> 01:08:17,260
You brought an awful situation here.

1388
01:08:17,359 --> 01:08:19,464
Get out of here and let us handle it.

1389
01:08:19,561 --> 01:08:21,871
- Go back to Wherever you come from.
- Now hold on.

1390
01:08:21,964 --> 01:08:23,671
You do not have to
talk to her like that.

1391
01:08:24,433 --> 01:08:25,912
Mr. Mayor.

1392
01:08:26,935 --> 01:08:29,211
You fire her. Right now.

1393
01:08:29,304 --> 01:08:31,045
DO it.

1394
01:08:32,608 --> 01:08:36,146
- Lacey, I'm sorry.
- There we go.

1395
01:08:38,246 --> 01:08:39,725
I understand.

1396
01:08:43,251 --> 01:08:45,629
You believe that? Sheldon.

1397
01:08:45,721 --> 01:08:47,530
This is a hell of a mess.

1398
01:08:57,866 --> 01:08:59,903
You all do your homework, okay?

1399
01:09:01,503 --> 01:09:04,677
And... be good
for your new teacher.

1400
01:09:06,842 --> 01:09:08,321
Where are you going?

1401
01:09:10,846 --> 01:09:12,484
I made a mistake...

1402
01:09:13,715 --> 01:09:15,524
and now I have to leave.

1403
01:09:15,617 --> 01:09:19,394
No. I'll sing.
I'll do the solo.

1404
01:09:20,155 --> 01:09:23,659
I dorft think there's gonna be
a Christmas Jubilee this year.

1405
01:09:23,759 --> 01:09:25,761
I dorft Want you to go.

1406
01:09:25,861 --> 01:09:28,171
Bailey, you are so special.

1407
01:09:28,263 --> 01:09:30,641
You always remember that.

1408
01:09:32,501 --> 01:09:34,947
- Okay?
- Yes, ma' am.

1409
01:09:35,037 --> 01:09:36,516
You all are.

1410
01:09:38,907 --> 01:09:40,386
I'll see you.

1411
01:09:42,010 --> 01:09:44,547
- I'm so sorry.
- It's fine.

1412
01:09:49,184 --> 01:09:50,754
Good job, boys.

1413
01:09:58,694 --> 01:10:00,674
I just got done telling Madea...

1414
01:10:00,762 --> 01:10:03,902
that you was in here all alone
with Eileen, and she said that-

1415
01:10:03,999 --> 01:10:06,946
I said you was in here
with the beast of the southern Wild.

1416
01:10:08,603 --> 01:10:10,810
I tried.
That Woman is stubborn.

1417
01:10:10,906 --> 01:10:13,477
I tried. I asked her
if I could help her cook.

1418
01:10:13,575 --> 01:10:15,054
Nothing, nothing, nothing.

1419
01:10:15,143 --> 01:10:17,054
Yeah, I know.
She's difficult.

1420
01:10:17,145 --> 01:10:19,125
It's all right.
She got a problem, but ifs all right.

1421
01:10:19,214 --> 01:10:21,387
- Y'all Want some lemonade?
- No, I'm good.

1422
01:10:21,483 --> 01:10:23,121
- I'm good. Thank you.
- There you are.

1423
01:10:23,218 --> 01:10:25,630
I've been Worried about you.

1424
01:10:25,721 --> 01:10:28,702
You were out there
with them for a While.

1425
01:10:28,790 --> 01:10:30,770
Yeah. I was conflicted.

1426
01:10:30,859 --> 01:10:35,501
I didn't know if I should
look for you or watch the food.

1427
01:10:35,597 --> 01:10:38,100
I didn't let her near our food.

1428
01:10:39,134 --> 01:10:43,173
You whisper like a damn bullhorn.
That Woman airft gonna hurt us.

1429
01:10:43,271 --> 01:10:45,251
We dorft know that, do we?

1430
01:10:45,340 --> 01:10:46,978
What y'all talking about over there?

1431
01:10:47,075 --> 01:10:49,282
She just thinks
y'all are tryin' to kill us.

1432
01:10:50,879 --> 01:10:52,381
- Tryin' to kill you?
- Good heavens!

1433
01:10:52,481 --> 01:10:54,961
- You're nuts!
- I've never hurt a flea or a fly.

1434
01:10:55,050 --> 01:10:57,030
I've seen her shoot
a deer once though.

1435
01:10:57,119 --> 01:11:00,430
I never. I would never shoot
little Bambi sipping Water in a pond.

1436
01:11:00,522 --> 01:11:03,469
I'm just gonna ask y'all.
I'm gonna put it out on the table.

1437
01:11:03,558 --> 01:11:04,935
- Be honest.
- What is it?

1438
01:11:05,026 --> 01:11:06,664
Y'all in the Ku Klux Klan?

1439
01:11:07,562 --> 01:11:09,542
- That's What she wanna know.
- Get outta here!

1440
01:11:09,631 --> 01:11:11,611
Heavens no.
Why would she-

1441
01:11:11,700 --> 01:11:14,476
- Buddy, the other night with the sheet.
- Oh, with the sheet!

1442
01:11:14,569 --> 01:11:16,071
Yes! Explain that.

1443
01:11:16,171 --> 01:11:18,151
We used to play
this game, all right?

1444
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:20,151
Buddy and I,
when we were young, he Would-

1445
01:11:20,242 --> 01:11:22,882
It was called
the Ghost and the Damsel.

1446
01:11:22,978 --> 01:11:24,958
And he would blindfold me.

1447
01:11:25,046 --> 01:11:27,526
Then he'd put a sheet above himself...

1448
01:11:27,616 --> 01:11:29,653
and then I would
have to search about...

1449
01:11:29,751 --> 01:11:31,788
and capture the rapture,
if you know What I mean.

1450
01:11:31,887 --> 01:11:33,457
Mama!

1451
01:11:33,555 --> 01:11:35,057
I am sorry, Conner.

1452
01:11:35,157 --> 01:11:37,433
- That's just nasty.
- Sorry, Son.

1453
01:11:37,526 --> 01:11:39,665
- But I like it.
- I know.

1454
01:11:39,761 --> 01:11:42,139
It can be fun.
It can be.

1455
01:11:42,230 --> 01:11:45,074
That is so inappropriate.

1456
01:11:45,167 --> 01:11:48,637
You two need to "earn
how to respect my daughKeVs house.

1457
01:11:49,604 --> 01:11:52,380
- Eileen, you might wanna let that go.
- No.

1458
01:11:52,474 --> 01:11:54,545
They come in here
taking advantage of her...

1459
01:11:54,643 --> 01:11:58,056
eating her food, and they're acting
like they owh the place.

1460
01:11:58,146 --> 01:12:00,319
- I dorft like it.
- You need to let that go.

1461
01:12:00,415 --> 01:12:03,021
Well, ldorft like-

1462
01:12:03,118 --> 01:12:05,291
- Mama-
- that you-

1463
01:12:05,387 --> 01:12:06,866
Mama, sit clown.

1464
01:12:06,955 --> 01:12:09,492
You out clown
my family's memory tree.

1465
01:12:09,591 --> 01:12:11,571
That's What I dorft like.

1466
01:12:11,660 --> 01:12:13,162
Excuse me?

1467
01:12:13,261 --> 01:12:16,265
I can deal with a lot of things.
They know it.

1468
01:12:16,364 --> 01:12:18,810
But this is downright wrong...

1469
01:12:18,900 --> 01:12:21,744
and now I am getting very upset!

1470
01:12:22,604 --> 01:12:25,847
Why would you plant his memory tree
on my daughtefis land...

1471
01:12:25,941 --> 01:12:27,921
and how was
I supposed to know that?

1472
01:12:28,009 --> 01:12:29,989
Oh, I dorft know.

1473
01:12:30,078 --> 01:12:33,082
Maybe because it had
a yellow ribbon around it?

1474
01:12:33,181 --> 01:12:34,785
That doesrft mean anything.

1475
01:12:34,883 --> 01:12:38,330
In most countries, in most places,
to sane-thinking people...

1476
01:12:38,420 --> 01:12:41,094
a yellow ribbon means something.

1477
01:12:41,189 --> 01:12:45,160
Now you just calm clown, missy.
Okay?

1478
01:12:45,260 --> 01:12:49,265
Now, Lacey, are you gonna let her
talk to me like this?

1479
01:12:49,364 --> 01:12:51,275
- Mama, calm clown.
- Put your finger clown...

1480
01:12:51,366 --> 01:12:53,505
or I will out it off
and deep-fry it!

1481
01:12:54,903 --> 01:12:57,440
You need to leave
my daughtefis house.

1482
01:12:57,539 --> 01:12:59,416
- Mama, stop it! Stop!
- No!

1483
01:12:59,507 --> 01:13:01,384
Eileen, you need to stop
right now, honey.

1484
01:13:01,476 --> 01:13:04,320
What are they doing here anyway?
Tomorrow is Christmas!

1485
01:13:04,412 --> 01:13:05,948
They are not your family!

1486
01:13:06,047 --> 01:13:08,288
- Let's get out of here.
- No, hold up.

1487
01:13:08,383 --> 01:13:10,693
Come on back here.
Ain't nobody going nowhere.

1488
01:13:10,785 --> 01:13:13,425
- Now, Maclea-
- Ain't nobody goin' no damn where.

1489
01:13:13,521 --> 01:13:15,501
Madea, whose side are you on?

1490
01:13:15,590 --> 01:13:17,968
- Let 'em leave.
- No, I'm on the side of right.

1491
01:13:18,059 --> 01:13:20,164
- That's the side I'm on. Lacey?
- Yes.

1492
01:13:20,262 --> 01:13:23,266
- Tell your mama.
- What? Tell me What?

1493
01:13:23,365 --> 01:13:26,505
Spit it out before I punch you,
put your teeth clown your throat!

1494
01:13:29,137 --> 01:13:31,981
Mama-
Conner and I are married.

1495
01:13:36,177 --> 01:13:38,487
- Catch her.
- Get the defibrillator.

1496
01:13:43,785 --> 01:13:46,231
Lacey. Your father.

1497
01:13:47,289 --> 01:13:50,293
I know, Mama. I know
he was murdered by a white man, but-

1498
01:13:50,392 --> 01:13:51,894
- What happened?
- What?

1499
01:13:51,993 --> 01:13:55,270
My father was killed by
a white man on Christmas Eve...

1500
01:13:55,363 --> 01:13:57,172
trying to protect my mothefis honor.

1501
01:13:57,265 --> 01:13:59,267
- That's awful.
- Good Lord.

1502
01:13:59,367 --> 01:14:02,371
- Who told you that?
- Mama.

1503
01:14:02,470 --> 01:14:05,644
Eileen, you oughta be ashamed-
Child, that's some straight-up bull-

1504
01:14:05,740 --> 01:14:07,048
Madea!

1505
01:14:07,742 --> 01:14:10,222
Your daddy wasrft killed
by no white man.

1506
01:14:10,912 --> 01:14:13,290
He left your mama for a white Woman
when you was two...

1507
01:14:13,381 --> 01:14:15,725
and your mama has been bitter
with white people ever since.

1508
01:14:15,817 --> 01:14:17,296
- What?
- Yes, years ago.

1509
01:14:17,385 --> 01:14:21,697
Ran off and joined the circus.
And now they on Glee.

1510
01:14:21,790 --> 01:14:23,269
Good show.

1511
01:14:23,358 --> 01:14:26,100
Glee?
Mama, is this true?

1512
01:14:27,128 --> 01:14:28,801
Mama!

1513
01:14:28,897 --> 01:14:34,540
Lacey, I am so disappointed in you.

1514
01:14:34,636 --> 01:14:36,912
Look at her
trying to turn it around on you.

1515
01:14:38,006 --> 01:14:39,485
Girl, please.

1516
01:14:44,346 --> 01:14:46,053
You're disappointed in me?

1517
01:14:46,915 --> 01:14:49,156
Well, that Went well.

1518
01:14:49,250 --> 01:14:51,457
At least she didn't
have another heart attack.

1519
01:14:53,188 --> 01:14:55,259
- Another one?
- Yeah, Madea.

1520
01:14:55,357 --> 01:14:58,270
Didnt you know that my mother
had a heart attack last year?

1521
01:14:58,360 --> 01:15:00,499
Your mama lied to you.
She had gas.

1522
01:15:00,595 --> 01:15:03,439
Got to the doctor, she was clutching
her heart and the pearls.

1523
01:15:03,531 --> 01:15:05,841
Got there, doctor say ifs gas.

1524
01:15:05,934 --> 01:15:09,438
- Wait, What?
- They put one of them rods up there.

1525
01:15:09,537 --> 01:15:12,416
Came flowing out like the River Jordan
and that was it. it was all over.

1526
01:15:12,507 --> 01:15:13,986
I had that once too.

1527
01:15:14,075 --> 01:15:16,578
Put it in there, come out
sounding like brakes coming out of-

1528
01:15:16,678 --> 01:15:18,988
The air pressure
coming out of one of them big rigs.

1529
01:15:20,115 --> 01:15:22,356
There it is.
Then they tell her she had heartburn.

1530
01:15:22,450 --> 01:15:25,192
- She didht have ho heart attack.
- She had heartburn?

1531
01:15:25,286 --> 01:15:27,823
She needs
some of that Prilosec OTC.

1532
01:15:29,357 --> 01:15:32,031
She been manipulating you.
She as healthy as an ox.

1533
01:15:32,127 --> 01:15:34,129
Well, that womarfs
a pretty pissed off ox.

1534
01:15:35,130 --> 01:15:36,609
Don't get behind her.

1535
01:15:38,099 --> 01:15:41,103
Don't light a match.
Don't get her next to an open flame.

1536
01:15:41,202 --> 01:15:42,681
We'll all have burnt heads.

1537
01:15:42,771 --> 01:15:45,342
Yeah, her farts can spell her name,
they so bad.

1538
01:15:48,143 --> 01:15:51,681
- Mama, he got her fired.
- That's all right. I'm upset too.

1539
01:15:52,380 --> 01:15:54,951
We should go, boy.
We got work to do.

1540
01:15:57,986 --> 01:16:00,193
Why'd you do that to Mrs. Williams?

1541
01:16:00,288 --> 01:16:03,269
You know, she's a nice lady.
Why'd you get her fired?

1542
01:16:03,358 --> 01:16:05,395
You dorft know whafs

1543
01:16:05,493 --> 01:16:07,996
I know you dorft like people
'cause of the Way they look.

1544
01:16:08,096 --> 01:16:10,940
That airft right!
That's What kids do to me at school!

1545
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:15,509
It ain't fair.
She's nice to me.

1546
01:16:16,971 --> 01:16:18,814
Don't you ever"...

1547
01:16:18,907 --> 01:16:20,887

1548
01:16:20,975 --> 01:16:22,750
You hear me?

1549
01:16:22,844 --> 01:16:24,824
Get out on that plow.

1550
01:16:30,552 --> 01:16:32,532
He is right, and you know it.

1551
01:16:32,620 --> 01:16:34,531
She made a deal with the devil.

1552
01:16:34,622 --> 01:16:37,466
No, you're actin'
more like the devil than she is.

1553
01:16:37,559 --> 01:16:39,539
And this is Christmas, Tanner.

1554
01:16:50,939 --> 01:16:54,352
This child still sitting out there.
That's just crazy as hell.

1555
01:16:54,442 --> 01:16:55,921
Where y'all going?

1556
01:16:56,010 --> 01:16:57,785
Well, Miss Media,

1557
01:16:57,879 --> 01:16:59,358
My name is Madea, honey.

1558
01:16:59,447 --> 01:17:00,926
- Madea.
- Thank you.

1559
01:17:01,015 --> 01:17:03,518
We're gonna bring her hot chocolate
to warm her hard, hard heart.

1560
01:17:03,618 --> 01:17:05,757
Hot chocolate does wonders.
It's delicious.

1561
01:17:06,521 --> 01:17:09,400
That's What got y'all in trouble,
the hot chocolate.

1562
01:17:09,491 --> 01:17:11,596
Your son with the hot chocolate.

1563
01:17:11,693 --> 01:17:13,673
I'm telling you.
Let me explain something to you.

1564
01:17:13,761 --> 01:17:15,570
Let me make this clear to y'all.

1565
01:17:15,663 --> 01:17:17,643
Leave her out there.
She is grown, sitting there.

1566
01:17:17,732 --> 01:17:20,713
If she want to come in the house,
she know how to get in. Leave her alone.

1567
01:17:20,802 --> 01:17:23,544
We're gonna go out and try.
We'll talk to her a bit.

1568
01:17:23,638 --> 01:17:25,117
Go on. Go on.

1569
01:17:25,206 --> 01:17:27,152
Okay. You better Wear a cup.

1570
01:17:27,242 --> 01:17:28,721
That's comforting.

1571
01:17:35,783 --> 01:17:37,888
Boy, this is something else, isn't it?
It's freezing.

1572
01:17:37,986 --> 01:17:39,988
Remember, Buddy,
kill her with kindness.

1573
01:17:40,088 --> 01:17:42,068
My weenie is an inny right now.

1574
01:17:42,157 --> 01:17:45,695
Try to have as much charm
with your voice as you do with your weenie.

1575
01:17:45,793 --> 01:17:48,501
Well, tell you What.
I airft used to this cold weather.

1576
01:17:48,596 --> 01:17:50,735
I know. All right?

1577
01:17:50,832 --> 01:17:52,812
I'm gonna have to wipe
with an ice scraper tonight.

1578
01:17:52,901 --> 01:17:55,211
Smile's all in patience.
Ask the Lord.

1579
01:17:55,303 --> 01:17:57,408
Lord, help us.
The Serenity Prayer.

1580
01:17:57,505 --> 01:18:01,282
There ain't no cabs out here.
You wanna come back in the house?

1581
01:18:01,376 --> 01:18:02,912
I'm fine right here.

1582
01:18:03,011 --> 01:18:05,389
I made you
some pipin' hot chocolate.

1583
01:18:06,147 --> 01:18:09,026
Thank you.

1584
01:18:09,117 --> 01:18:10,755
My son likes chocolate.

1585
01:18:12,520 --> 01:18:15,364
Go ahead and laugh.
This is awful.

1586
01:18:15,456 --> 01:18:18,198
What's so awful about it?

1587
01:18:18,293 --> 01:18:21,900
What world are you living in?
They are asking for trouble.

1588
01:18:21,996 --> 01:18:23,441
Eileen, I-

1589
01:18:23,531 --> 01:18:25,704
Mrs. Murphy to you.

1590
01:18:25,800 --> 01:18:28,781
Miss Murphy, you can take a knife
and out all three of us right now.

1591
01:18:28,870 --> 01:18:30,850
You know whafs gonna happen?
We're gonna bleed red.

1592
01:18:30,939 --> 01:18:33,351
Blood red.
We're all the same inside.

1593
01:18:33,441 --> 01:18:35,114
That's true.

1594
01:18:35,210 --> 01:18:38,384
Mrs. Murphy, if I may...

1595
01:18:39,480 --> 01:18:43,451
our children, no matter what we think,
they will live their own lives.

1596
01:18:44,652 --> 01:18:47,258
- The world is changing.
- Not that much.

1597
01:18:47,355 --> 01:18:50,962
It is changing,
and that is a good thing.

1598
01:18:51,059 --> 01:18:54,802
Every generation
sees a little less division...

1599
01:18:54,896 --> 01:18:59,902
and a little more open minds
and open hearts.

1600
01:19:01,135 --> 01:19:04,116
I think we should
be happy and proud...

1601
01:19:04,205 --> 01:19:06,651
that our kids, our children...

1602
01:19:06,741 --> 01:19:10,245
see people as people.

1603
01:19:10,912 --> 01:19:12,255
That was beautiful.

1604
01:19:12,347 --> 01:19:14,418
- That was unbelievable.
- Thank you. I mean it.

1605
01:19:14,515 --> 01:19:17,189
Come in the house and get to know us.
We're good folks.

1606
01:19:17,285 --> 01:19:20,129
I know damn well

1607
01:19:20,221 --> 01:19:21,962

1609
01:19:24,092 --> 01:19:25,696
Beelzebub!

1610

You got these people out here
trying to tempt you back in the house...

1612
01:19:30,098 --> 01:19:33,170
like a wet cat on a cold
Sunday morning who needs some milk.

1613
01:19:33,268 --> 01:19:34,906
Come in the house.
You're out here freezing.

1614
01:19:35,003 --> 01:19:38,416
Your ankles is Whiter than snow.

1615
01:19:38,506 --> 01:19:40,747
My gosh, they are white.
Look, we are related.

1616
01:19:41,776 --> 01:19:45,189
I will not step
into that house of lies.

1617
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:47,920
The girl is married. You carft control
every minute of her life.

1618
01:19:48,016 --> 01:19:49,757
Do you understand?
It is Christmas.

1619
01:19:49,851 --> 01:19:53,321
Give this child the gift of being able
to do whatever she Want to do.

1620
01:19:53,421 --> 01:19:56,493
You cant run her life for her.

You ever woke up on Christmas morning
and didn't get the gift you wanted?

1628
01:20:13,775 --> 01:20:16,915
This is it. You didn't get the gift

Not one of them.

1642
01:21:05,226 --> 01:21:06,534
Hey.

1643
01:21:08,563 --> 01:21:11,100
Your mama's still out in the cold.
You may Want to talk to her.

1644
01:21:11,199 --> 01:21:14,112
- She cloesrTt want to talk to me.
- You sure about that?

1645
01:21:14,202 --> 01:21:15,840
I know my mother.

1646
01:21:15,937 --> 01:21:18,474
Apparently you dorft know her
as well as you think.

1647
01:21:18,573 --> 01:21:20,553
And whafs that supposed to mean?

1648
01:21:20,641 --> 01:21:24,111
She's been manipulating you
your entire life.

1649
01:21:24,212 --> 01:21:28,126
She lied to you about your daddy
and about her heart attacks.

1650
01:21:28,216 --> 01:21:29,695
It's just not right.

1651
01:21:29,784 --> 01:21:31,695
Can you stop talking
about my mother now?

1652
01:21:31,786 --> 01:21:34,995
I'm not talkin' about your mother.
I'm just statin' the obvious.

1653
01:21:35,089 --> 01:21:36,898
I'm not trying to attack you or her.

1654
01:21:36,991 --> 01:21:39,130
Good, because I've been
attacked enough today.

1655
01:21:39,227 --> 01:21:43,573
Between my mother and my job and-
it's just all a bit much.

What did Tanner do?

1662
01:22:02,850 --> 01:22:06,388
He was so nasty.
And then he got me fired.

1692
01:24:25,593 --> 01:24:28,301

01:24:52,787 --> 01:24:54,266
Get out of here.

1699
01:25:09,203 --> 01:25:11,114
Babe, I wish you
wouldrft have done that.

1700
01:25:11,205 --> 01:25:12,513
It had to be done.

1701
01:25:12,607 --> 01:25:15,520
Nothing stops somebody like him
from bullying people except pushing back.

1702
01:25:15,610 --> 01:25:19,251
That's right. That kids been a terror
to Conner since he was a little boy.

1703
01:25:19,347 --> 01:25:22,123
I'm glad you done What you did, Son.

I dorft like it.

1706
01:25:26,621 --> 01:25:28,601
I just wanna tell
you all how sorry I am.

1707
01:25:28,689 --> 01:25:31,033
I should have told my mom
from the beginning.

1708
01:25:31,125 --> 01:25:33,628
That is the truth.
You shouldve told her.

1709
01:25:33,728 --> 01:25:36,572
We have met your mama
and we understand.

1710
01:25:36,664 --> 01:25:38,644
She crazy as hell.
Didrft I tell you?

1711
01:25:38,733 --> 01:25:40,770
- She's cuckoo.
- That's right.

1712
01:25:41,836 --> 01:25:44,146
I dorft like you all talking about me.

1713
01:25:44,238 --> 01:25:45,876
No, Mrs. Murphy, I'm sorry.

1714
01:25:45,973 --> 01:25:48,715
We were just saying
that God makes everyone different...

1715
01:25:48,809 --> 01:25:51,790
and you are a gem in Gods ring.

1716
01:25:54,749 --> 01:25:57,252
And I dorft like the Way
you spoke to me.

1717
01:25:57,351 --> 01:26:00,059
Well, I'm sorry.
I was angry.

1718
01:26:00,154 --> 01:26:04,330
- What did you say?
- He told her to get her ass in the truck.

1719
01:26:04,425 --> 01:26:07,565
- And What did you do?
- She got her ass in the truck.

1720
01:26:09,130 --> 01:26:10,871
Go ahead and laugh.

1721
01:26:10,965 --> 01:26:13,104
Hold on, Eileen.
Y'all need to let all this go.

1722
01:26:13,200 --> 01:26:16,181
You lied. She done lie.
Everybody lied. Here a lie, there a lie.

1723
01:26:16,270 --> 01:26:19,183
It's Christmas now. You need
to go down there and buy her a tree.

1724
01:26:19,273 --> 01:26:21,753
And plant it in the backyard.
Get her a ribbon.

1725
01:26:21,842 --> 01:26:23,321
- A yellow one.
- I'm sorry.

1726
01:26:23,411 --> 01:26:26,221
I just Wanted to give
my daughter a proper wedding.

1727
01:26:26,313 --> 01:26:28,759
Mama, you've always been overbearing.

1728
01:26:28,849 --> 01:26:31,728
I did it for me.
Not for you.

1729
01:26:31,819 --> 01:26:34,663
I love you, and I'm sorry...

1730
01:26:34,755 --> 01:26:36,928

but this is my life.

1731
01:26:37,024 --> 01:26:40,631
And he loves me,
and he treats me oh so well.

1732
01:26:40,728 --> 01:26:43,868
I'm sorry.
I just didn't Want you to get hurt.

1733
01:26:43,964 --> 01:26:47,502
Mama, he's not gonna hurt me.
He's as gentle as a lamb.

1734
01:26:49,336 --> 01:26:52,249
No, he's not. He beat that man
clown to the ground.

1735
01:26:52,807 --> 01:26:56,084
Come on. That guy had it 0omin',
and everybody knows it.

1736
01:26:56,177 --> 01:26:58,987
Well, he did say

1737
01:26:59,680 --> 01:27:01,660
I love your daughter, Miss Murphy.

1738
01:27:01,749 --> 01:27:04,889
I'll never let anything happen to her.
I promise.

1739
01:27:04,985 --> 01:27:06,623
That makes two of us.

1740
01:27:06,721 --> 01:27:11,830
Okay. Well, this is all new to me.
I clon't know, but... I'll try.

1741
01:27:15,329 --> 01:27:17,775
Nothing beats a failure but a try.

1742
01:27:17,865 --> 01:27:20,709
- Now we're making some progress.
- Yeah.

1743
01:27:20,801 --> 01:27:22,439
A try's a try, right?

1744
01:27:24,672 --> 01:27:28,142
Oh, boy. That's Tanner.
That's trouble.

1745
01:27:28,242 --> 01:27:30,347
He's still got it.
I knew you got it in you.

1746
01:27:30,444 --> 01:27:31,787
- Now, clon't.

1747
01:27:32,913 --> 01:27:36,759
You get off my property, Tanner McCoy,
before I knock you on your ass again.

1748
01:27:36,851 --> 01:27:39,354
- Give him a chance.
- He's just coming here to start trouble.

1749
01:27:39,453 --> 01:27:43,162
- No, he's not.
- I Want to apologize.

1750
01:27:43,991 --> 01:27:46,562

01:27:46,660 --> 01:27:48,469

Oh, thank you!

1756
01:28:03,711 --> 01:28:05,520
He really is a good man.

1757
01:28:05,613 --> 01:28:07,593
He's just been so troubled...

1758
01:28:07,681 --> 01:28:09,820
with all that's been going on
with the dam.

1759
01:28:13,320 --> 01:28:14,799
Thank you.

1760
01:28:20,427 --> 01:28:22,668
Tanner, I've been working on
a new strain of corn...

1761
01:28:22,763 --> 01:28:24,572
that doesrft need as much water.

1762
01:28:24,665 --> 01:28:27,077
I could use your help with it.

1763
01:28:29,670 --> 01:28:31,775
Yeah. I'd be glad to.

1764
01:28:38,612 --> 01:28:40,990
I'm sorry I Wanted to get you fired.

1765
01:28:41,081 --> 01:28:43,823
I'm gonna talk to the mayor tomorrow.
Promise.

1766
01:28:43,918 --> 01:28:45,898
I'm sure he's still very upset.

1767
01:28:45,986 --> 01:28:49,729
Having to choose between
going on with Jubilee or getting sued...

1768
01:28:49,824 --> 01:28:51,565
is pretty crazy.

1769
01:28:51,659 --> 01:28:54,572
The towrfs going on with it,
but we're not happy...

1770
01:28:54,662 --> 01:28:58,576
about not being able to say Jesus
or celebrate his birth.

1771
01:28:58,666 --> 01:29:00,577
You know, Baileys been practicing...

1772
01:29:00,668 --> 01:29:03,148
and all the kids are really sad.

1773
01:29:04,238 --> 01:29:07,515
Yeah, I've been thinking about that,
and I have ah idea.

1774
01:29:08,876 --> 01:29:11,379
Oh, jingle bells, jingle bells

1775
01:29:11,478 --> 01:29:13,458
Jingle all the way

1776
01:29:13,547 --> 01:29:16,084
- We are live-
- Look at all the news vans.

1777
01:29:17,852 --> 01:29:20,628
This old town has never had
this much attention.

1778
01:29:20,721 --> 01:29:23,395
Well, since the whorehouse
closed down in 1970.

1779
01:29:23,490 --> 01:29:26,562
- That was a sad day.
- What do you think about the celebration?

1780
01:29:26,660 --> 01:29:29,732
Well, I say Christmas is about Jesus.

1781
01:29:29,830 --> 01:29:33,437
I ran clown here.
I ran for my life!

1782
01:29:33,534 --> 01:29:35,571
'Cause I was gonna start a fire.

1783
01:29:35,669 --> 01:29:37,478
"O Lord Jesus is a fire."

1784
01:29:37,571 --> 01:29:39,209
Ain't nobody got time for that.

1785
01:29:39,306 --> 01:29:41,547
- Hell no.
- Hold on there.

1786
01:29:41,642 --> 01:29:44,316
- We need to shut this down.
- Just Wait a sec.

1787
01:29:44,411 --> 01:29:46,118
See What she's got to say.

1788
01:29:46,213 --> 01:29:48,557
I told them to hide the kids,
hide they wife...

1789
01:29:48,649 --> 01:29:51,459
and hide they Santa Claus,
'cause ifs crazy around here.

1796
01:30:11,238 --> 01:30:12,979
They are very powerful.

1797
01:30:13,841 --> 01:30:16,321
You have to take clown the nativity.

1798
01:30:16,410 --> 01:30:17,889
Okay, that's it.

1799
01:30:18,579 --> 01:30:21,025
May I have everyone's attention?

1800
01:30:21,115 --> 01:30:22,423
What is she doing?

1801
01:30:22,516 --> 01:30:24,154

1804
01:30:30,190 --> 01:30:32,170

a little presentation for us all...

1829
01:32:04,218 --> 01:32:07,028
and this has all been under the direction
of their current teacher-

1830
01:32:07,121 --> 01:32:09,101
May be Wrong for that.

1831
01:32:09,189 --> 01:32:11,169
I am so proud of the kids.

1832
01:32:11,258 --> 01:32:12,703
Mrs. Lacey Williams.

1833
01:32:12,793 --> 01:32:15,774
- Did she say, "Mrs. Lacey Williams"?
- It was all her idea.

1834
01:32:15,863 --> 01:32:19,436
- Yep, she did.
- So, thank you, Lacey, for everything.

1835
01:32:19,533 --> 01:32:24,846
And now the children of McCoy School,
featuring Bailey McCoy.

1836
01:32:26,974 --> 01:32:28,453
That's my boy!

1837
01:32:31,478 --> 01:32:35,824
Mary, did you know

1838
01:32:35,916 --> 01:32:39,420
That your baby boy

1839
01:32:39,520 --> 01:32:43,900
Would give sight to the blind man?

1840
01:32:43,991 --> 01:32:48,269
Mary, did you know

1841
01:32:48,362 --> 01:32:51,104
- That your baby boy
- Hey, baby.

1842
01:32:51,198 --> 01:32:52,677
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1843
01:32:52,766 --> 01:32:57,340
Would calm a storm with his hand?

1844
01:32:57,438 --> 01:33:00,351
Did you know

1845
01:33:00,441 --> 01:33:03,979
That your baby boy

1846
01:33:04,078 --> 01:33:09,460
Has walked where angels trod

1847
01:33:09,550 --> 01:33:15,592
And when you kiss your little baby

1848
01:33:15,689 --> 01:33:21,367
You have kissed the face of God?

1849
01:33:21,462 --> 01:33:25,569
Mary, did you

1850
01:33:26,333 --> 01:33:30,804
Know?

1851
01:33:57,431 --> 01:33:59,502
You dorft need to have
no lingerie on.

1852
01:33:59,600 --> 01:34:03,548
Eileen, tell him we've been shopping
at Tiftorfs for over 15 years.

I'm gonna help her.

1854
01:34:05,906 --> 01:34:07,647
Okay, go help her.
Fifteen years.

1855
01:34:07,741 --> 01:34:10,278
Well, 15 years ago

1856
01:34:10,377 --> 01:34:12,220
But now the lingerie

1857
01:34:12,312 --> 01:34:13,791
You are so insulting!

1858
01:34:13,881 --> 01:34:15,861
I am not insulting.
I am telling you the truth.

1859
01:34:15,949 --> 01:34:17,587
You shouldrft have on
no damn lingerie.

1860
01:34:17,684 --> 01:34:19,391
I'm trying to save you
some embarrassment.

1861
01:34:19,486 --> 01:34:22,228
Put on that damn lingerie, look like

1862
01:34:22,322 --> 01:34:26,429
I mean, come on now. Come on, honey.
I'm trying to help y'all.

1863
01:34:26,527 --> 01:34:29,030
- Is this good?
- There you go trying to control everything.

1864
01:34:29,129 --> 01:34:31,336
- I am not trying to-
- Let me get the lines clean.

1865
01:34:31,431 --> 01:34:32,910
Let me get the eye lines clean...

1866
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,241

and a single on you.

1867
01:34:35,335 --> 01:34:37,315
And Maysieé sitting
in the editing room right now cussing...

1868
01:34:37,404 --> 01:34:39,042
'cause we're talking
all over each other.

1869
01:34:39,139 --> 01:34:41,642
Lacey, you do not
have a Christmas tree!

1870
01:34:41,742 --> 01:34:43,722
- Mama.
- What? No, really!

1871
01:34:43,810 --> 01:34:45,289
That's why you Wanted me here-

1872
01:34:45,379 --> 01:34:47,916
- Yup, thats exactly why.
- I'll clean up and straighten out.

1873
01:34:48,015 --> 01:34:50,461
I'm gonna take this room.
Let me go straighten up a little.

1874
01:34:50,551 --> 01:34:52,462

1875
01:34:52,553 --> 01:34:55,124
- Is this one yours, Madea?
- All right, come on.

1876
01:34:55,222 --> 01:34:57,202
What you talking about?
You just talking all over everybody.

1877
01:35:01,328 --> 01:35:03,934
- Hi.
- Look, they do it in unison.

1878
01:35:04,031 --> 01:35:06,910
They all do it in unison.
That's nice. Unison is nice.

1879
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:09,378
The unison is very nice.

1880
01:35:09,469 --> 01:35:11,506
You tryin' to correct me?
I say ifs "u-nis-on."

1881
01:35:11,605 --> 01:35:13,107
No, Aunt Medea.

1882
01:35:13,207 --> 01:35:14,948
So I have a meeting
clown the hall-

1883
01:35:15,042 --> 01:35:17,613
Any unison when they sang unison.

1884
01:35:17,711 --> 01:35:21,284
No, mafam, ifs not.
But that's fine. That's okay.

1885
01:35:21,381 --> 01:35:23,019
I have a meeting
clown the hall-

1886
01:35:23,116 --> 01:35:25,255
I thought it was "unison",
and "a cappollo."

1887
01:35:25,352 --> 01:35:27,832
When they sang in no music,
What is that?

1888
01:35:27,921 --> 01:35:29,059
No music?

1889
01:35:29,156 --> 01:35:31,466
Yeah, when you sang ancl there
ain't no music, ain't that a "oappollo"?

1890
01:35:31,558 --> 01:35:33,299
No, that's a cappella.

1891
01:35:33,393 --> 01:35:35,304
I dorft know much about music.

1892
01:35:35,395 --> 01:35:37,807
Me and Ike Turner didn't make it.
He Went on with Tina.

1893
01:35:38,832 --> 01:35:40,743
That's okay. That's okay.

1894
01:35:40,834 --> 01:35:42,575
I would beat the hell out of him.

1895
01:35:42,669 --> 01:35:44,808
Ike wasn't gonna put his hands on me.
That's all I'm saying.

1896
01:35:44,905 --> 01:35:46,680
I'm sorry.
Say What you're saying to the children.

1897
01:35:46,773 --> 01:35:48,184
- Are you done? Okay.

1898
01:35:48,275 --> 01:35:50,186

1899
01:35:50,277 --> 01:35:52,450
You ain't getting testy with me, are you?
Talkin' about "Are you done?"

1900
01:35:52,546 --> 01:35:54,822
- No, of course not.
- Okay.

1901
01:35:54,915 --> 01:35:58,362
Let's start over from the top, 'cause
that's gonna make it in the gag reel.

1902
01:35:58,452 --> 01:35:59,430
Speed.

1903
01:35:59,519 --> 01:36:00,998
- White lightning?
- Yeah, moonshine.

1904
01:36:01,088 --> 01:36:02,999
You Want to take a snort?

1905
01:36:03,090 --> 01:36:04,398
Nope, I'll pass.

1906
01:36:04,491 --> 01:36:07,301
Boy, it'll put some hair on your chest,
I'll guarantee ya.

1907
01:36:07,394 --> 01:36:11,001
Stop it. Come on.
Talk about hair on your chest.

1908
01:36:11,098 --> 01:36:13,009
I could French-braid his.

1909
01:36:13,100 --> 01:36:15,046
That's right.
I could put a little bow on it.

1910
01:36:15,135 --> 01:36:18,173
She's too pretty to have hair
on her chest. Really.

1911
01:36:18,272 --> 01:36:20,274
I gotta tell you,
I got rid of mine.

1912
01:36:20,374 --> 01:36:22,354
Little bat hairs
attached to needles...

1913
01:36:22,442 --> 01:36:24,615
soaked in cucumberjuice
and a boatload of Nair.

1914
01:36:24,711 --> 01:36:26,713
Gone, like that,

1916
01:36:29,383 --> 01:36:32,023
it was dry-humping a Wiener dog
right there on the porch.

1917
01:36:32,119 --> 01:36:35,692
She's Way prettier than the last one.
She looked like-

1918
01:36:35,789 --> 01:36:37,097
Tyler Perry.

1919
01:36:40,294 --> 01:36:42,103

Son, she's way prettier...

1920
01:36:42,195 --> 01:36:44,106

1921
01:36:44,197 --> 01:36:46,108
Good night.
She looked like old Tyler Perry.

1922
01:36:49,303 --> 01:36:51,214
All right. Keep going.

1923
01:36:51,305 --> 01:36:52,807
Oh, my God.

1924
01:36:52,906 --> 01:36:54,647

1925

I'm a truck driver.

1934
01:37:16,897 --> 01:37:20,174
Been out on the road a lot.
Long-haul truck driver.

1935
01:37:20,267 --> 01:37:21,575

1940
01:37:29,609 --> 01:37:30,917
Not "hole." Haul.

1941
01:37:31,011 --> 01:37:33,389
- A hole, a haul, okay.

01:37:38,518 --> 01:37:39,997
Yeah, he's still beating him up.

1945
01:37:40,087 --> 01:37:42,158
The little kid?
He's too big for that.

1946
01:37:42,255 --> 01:37:44,531
No, he's big now.
He's a regular-sized kid.

1947
01:37:44,624 --> 01:37:47,195
I mean, he growed with-
He growed with Conner.

1948
01:37:47,294 --> 01:37:50,332
Tanner, hes regular size.
He ain't like a dwarf or nothin'.

1949
01:37:50,430 --> 01:37:52,467
- He growed?
- Yeah, he growed up that tall.

1950
01:37:52,566 --> 01:37:55,240
He airft a dwarf.
I mean, shoot, he'd take a dwarf.

1951
01:37:55,335 --> 01:37:56,973
He'd kick ass out of a dwarf.

1952
01:37:57,070 --> 01:37:58,549
Hell, I hope so.

1953
01:37:58,638 --> 01:38:01,175
It's just regular-sized kids

1954
01:38:01,274 --> 01:38:04,312
- Okay. Okay.

1955
01:38:04,411 --> 01:38:07,085
I need a dictionary to keep up

1956

1957
01:38:11,017 --> 01:38:14,157
and then when you're done doin' her,
you keep doin' her again...

1958
01:38:14,254 --> 01:38:16,632
'cause you wanna keep doin'
What it is you need to do...

1959
01:38:16,723 --> 01:38:18,964
in order to do What
you need to be doin'.

1960
01:38:19,993 --> 01:38:21,165
Ain't that right?

1961
01:38:22,162 --> 01:38:23,800
She told you that lie too?

1962
01:38:23,897 --> 01:38:26,275
She didn't have
no damn heart attack.

1963
01:38:26,366 --> 01:38:29,643
She had gas. We got her
to the hospital, they said she had gas.

1964
01:38:29,736 --> 01:38:30,714
What?

1965
01:38:30,804 --> 01:38:34,149
They ran one of them pipes in there,
she farted, it was over.

1966
01:38:39,946 --> 01:38:41,892
Yeah, she had gas.

1967
01:38:41,982 --> 01:38:44,485
She had gas. She had gas.

1968
01:38:44,584 --> 01:38:47,565
They hit her in the stomach real hard
and she faded. It was over.

1969
01:38:47,654 --> 01:38:49,156
Then she had heartburn.

1970
01:38:49,256 --> 01:38:52,066
Sounds like she needs
some Prilosec OTC.

1971
01:38:53,360 --> 01:38:54,930

1972
01:38:55,028 --> 01:38:57,338

in this stuck-up-ass...

1973
01:38:57,431 --> 01:38:58,910

1974
01:38:58,999 --> 01:39:01,809

1975
01:39:05,505 --> 01:39:08,213
Where's my damn car?
Where's my damn car?

1976
01:39:09,776 --> 01:39:11,187
