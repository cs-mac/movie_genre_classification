1
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:50,943
Jane!

2
00:01:53,746 --> 00:01:55,013
Jane!

3
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,785
Jane, it's me. Open up.

4
00:02:01,421 --> 00:02:03,722
Did you tell anyone?
Did i...

5
00:02:03,724 --> 00:02:05,557
About the name. The name.

6
00:02:05,559 --> 00:02:07,693
Yeah, I told Rick.
He thought it was funny.

7
00:02:09,762 --> 00:02:11,430
Just Rick and nobody else?

8
00:02:11,432 --> 00:02:13,966
No. Why?
What's the matter?

9
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:17,236
Larry, what's wrong?

10
00:02:17,238 --> 00:02:18,704
I'm sorry.

11
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,774
You have no idea how sorry I am.

12
00:02:22,776 --> 00:02:24,943
Larry, you're scaring me.

13
00:02:24,945 --> 00:02:26,378
What are you doing?

14
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:13,058
Rick?

15
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,594
Ricky?

16
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,148
Rick, the name.

17
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:38,050
Janie!

18
00:03:38,052 --> 00:03:40,052
Did you tell anyone?
Anyone?

19
00:03:40,054 --> 00:03:43,155
Lar... Larry, please.
Please. I...

20
00:03:43,157 --> 00:03:44,590
Rick, he's coming!

21
00:03:46,192 --> 00:03:48,026
The name.

22
00:03:48,028 --> 00:03:49,728
Gi... Giselle.

23
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:52,064
I to...
I told Giselle.

24
00:04:25,231 --> 00:04:26,765
I'm gonna stop you!

25
00:04:49,055 --> 00:04:51,390
Giselle!

26
00:04:51,392 --> 00:04:53,759
- Larry!
- Mom! Run!

27
00:04:53,761 --> 00:04:55,827
- Who did you tell?
- He killed them!

28
00:04:59,565 --> 00:05:01,066
Don't think it.

29
00:05:01,068 --> 00:05:02,601
Mom, come on!
Don't say it.

30
00:05:02,603 --> 00:05:04,970
Don't think it.
Don't say it.

31
00:05:04,972 --> 00:05:07,739
Don't think it.
Don't say it.

32
00:05:07,741 --> 00:05:10,242
Don't think it.
Don't say it.

33
00:05:10,244 --> 00:05:13,145
Don't think it.
Don't say it.

34
00:05:13,147 --> 00:05:15,914
Don't think it.
Don't say it.

35
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:18,917
Giselle!
Did you say the name?

36
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:21,019
Don't think it.
Don't say it.

37
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:23,889
Don't say it.

38
00:05:29,762 --> 00:05:31,663
Who did you say
the name to, Giselle?

39
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,269
Larry!

40
00:05:38,339 --> 00:05:39,404
Larry!

41
00:06:19,345 --> 00:06:21,146
What's up, playboy?
How's it going?

42
00:06:21,148 --> 00:06:22,981
Good.

43
00:06:22,983 --> 00:06:24,716
Today is a good day.

44
00:06:25,985 --> 00:06:28,186
You got the key? No,
it's under the mat.

45
00:06:28,188 --> 00:06:29,521
Ah.

46
00:06:29,523 --> 00:06:31,490
It's only 20 minutes.

47
00:06:31,492 --> 00:06:34,159
This is the first time he's rented the
place. The guy says it's fantastic.

48
00:06:34,161 --> 00:06:36,228
What else would he say?
It's a doghouse?

49
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:38,830
I'm trying to convince her. Come on, man.
Work with me.

50
00:06:38,832 --> 00:06:40,932
Sash? Yeah. I'm up for it.

51
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:08,059
It's a little creepy.
Right?

52
00:07:08,061 --> 00:07:11,596
Nah, it's just cold.
Heat's off.

53
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:13,298
I gotta piss like a racehorse.

54
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:16,768
Cute.
Dude!

55
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,503
This place is sweet, bro.

56
00:07:43,095 --> 00:07:44,329
Hey.

57
00:07:52,905 --> 00:07:54,506
Right?

58
00:07:55,741 --> 00:07:58,310
We could put the desk
over there.

59
00:07:58,312 --> 00:08:00,178
We could put the bed here.

60
00:08:02,114 --> 00:08:04,015
Well, maybe if there was a bed.

61
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:08,753
I know. The landlord said
it was fully furnished.

62
00:08:08,755 --> 00:08:13,458
Yo, El, come and check this out, man.
This is crazy!

63
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:15,594
Yo, come on down.

64
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:19,931
Yo, El, come in here, man.

65
00:08:19,933 --> 00:08:22,934
Oh, it's... you can't get
this in the dorms, right?

66
00:08:22,936 --> 00:08:24,636
Now, that's...

67
00:08:24,638 --> 00:08:27,772
That's classic. John, you really
think Sasha wants to see that?

68
00:08:27,774 --> 00:08:29,808
Or that?
Oh.

69
00:08:31,478 --> 00:08:33,879
You got the whole upstairs
to make girlie. Okay?

70
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:38,483
I've definitely seen bigger.

71
00:08:38,485 --> 00:08:40,519
See?
You're awesome.

72
00:08:41,954 --> 00:08:43,989
Bro.

73
00:08:43,991 --> 00:08:45,857
She's awesome, man.

74
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:49,494
Oh, yeah, you guys must've been
hilarious when you were young.

75
00:08:49,496 --> 00:08:51,296
Must've been? Are.

76
00:08:51,298 --> 00:08:53,298
Tier 1.

77
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,967
Hey, he made me look smart,
and I made him look ugly.

78
00:08:55,969 --> 00:08:58,003
But after the crash,
he took care of me.

79
00:08:58,005 --> 00:09:01,206
Talk shit about my boy's
folks, you're done.

80
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:05,010
Okay, and the tier 1's

81
00:09:05,012 --> 00:09:08,313
are both ready to cook and clean and
help me do this place up, right?

82
00:09:08,315 --> 00:09:10,649
'Cause I'm not gonna be
your guys' maid.

83
00:09:10,651 --> 00:09:13,518
Of course not.
I told him. Right?

84
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,153
I never cooked you
my butter pasta-nette?

85
00:09:15,155 --> 00:09:18,223
That is not a thing.

86
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:20,525
- That's 'cause I invented it.
- Okay.

87
00:09:20,527 --> 00:09:23,094
And I clean too. I promise.

88
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:27,365
- Yo, what does this do?
- Yeah, you cook.

89
00:09:27,367 --> 00:09:29,467
I said I "cooked," okay?

90
00:09:37,176 --> 00:09:38,577
Found the furniture.

91
00:09:38,579 --> 00:09:40,745
I've heard about you
and all the girls.

92
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:43,848
And that's exactly why we need
to get out of the dorms.

93
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:45,250
And this is perfect.

94
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:47,352
Whoa! Easy.
Oh.

95
00:09:47,354 --> 00:09:48,887
You all right?

96
00:09:48,889 --> 00:09:50,822
Yeah. Thanks.

97
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,428
So it looks like
the landlord wasn't lying.

98
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:58,697
Wow.

99
00:09:58,699 --> 00:10:00,432
Damn, son.

100
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:11,276
Hey, I like this.

101
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,054
Ah, fuck.

102
00:10:23,056 --> 00:10:25,557
So?

103
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:26,891
Don't you want to?

104
00:10:26,893 --> 00:10:29,294
Well, yeah, yeah. I do.
Now, I know you...

105
00:10:29,296 --> 00:10:32,130
Yo, all the dishes
in here, they're white.

106
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:34,432
Just saying.

107
00:10:34,434 --> 00:10:36,167
He touches everything.

108
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:40,071
It's up to you, bear.
I can't afford it without him.

109
00:10:40,073 --> 00:10:42,741
I know you can, but I don't
want... Elliot. Elliot.

110
00:10:42,743 --> 00:10:44,242
Yeah?
We're doing it.

111
00:10:44,244 --> 00:10:45,810
Obviously.

112
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:47,212
Yeah?
Yeah.

113
00:10:51,117 --> 00:10:53,018
I see she approves, huh?

114
00:10:57,590 --> 00:11:00,458
Yo.
Hey, you need a hand?

115
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:02,127
No, I got this.

116
00:11:02,129 --> 00:11:04,295
Okay, don't break yourself.

117
00:11:04,297 --> 00:11:05,697
Better than going
to the gym, right?

118
00:11:25,151 --> 00:11:26,651
Hey, Elliot?

119
00:11:26,653 --> 00:11:27,886
Yeah?

120
00:11:35,494 --> 00:11:38,296
Hey, did you hear that banging?

121
00:11:38,298 --> 00:11:39,464
Yeah.

122
00:11:43,335 --> 00:11:44,736
The radiators sound worse.

123
00:11:47,841 --> 00:11:49,841
Okay, bear, here it is.

124
00:11:49,843 --> 00:11:54,479
Rilke says coins symbolize the
wonder and terror of fortune.

125
00:11:54,481 --> 00:11:56,981
"Do you land face up
or face down in the dirt?

126
00:11:56,983 --> 00:11:59,184
What home will you be born into?

127
00:11:59,186 --> 00:12:01,352
With whom will you fall in love?

128
00:12:01,354 --> 00:12:04,923
Fortune is truly like a coin
tossed by the hand of god."

129
00:12:16,035 --> 00:12:17,435
I'm wiped.

130
00:12:18,671 --> 00:12:20,739
Hmm.

131
00:12:20,741 --> 00:12:22,607
Thanks for finding me
that quote.

132
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:27,278
You wanna watch
something stupid?

133
00:12:29,515 --> 00:12:30,749
Mm-hmm.

134
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,051
Just us. Yeah.

135
00:12:33,053 --> 00:12:35,487
I'm gonna brush my teeth.

136
00:12:38,057 --> 00:12:39,824
Hey, what's on the bed?

137
00:12:50,035 --> 00:12:53,037
"You look like a model
from the '70s.

138
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:56,040
The personal pilot
of a James Bond villain.

139
00:12:56,042 --> 00:12:58,943
A 19-year-old
koala bear person."

140
00:13:01,914 --> 00:13:05,216
"If any of them were true,
I wouldn't have you.

141
00:13:05,218 --> 00:13:08,052
But they're not, and I do.

142
00:13:08,054 --> 00:13:09,354
Amazingly.

143
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:13,291
Bullshit aside,
I never thought I would meet,

144
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:15,660
let alone be with,
anyone like you.

145
00:13:16,729 --> 00:13:18,163
With so much love,

146
00:13:19,265 --> 00:13:21,466
your knight, Beau,

147
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:24,636
Casanova
and new roommate, Elliot."

148
00:13:27,773 --> 00:13:30,842
"No animals were harmed
in the making of this card."

149
00:14:01,307 --> 00:14:03,074
Hey, Elliot, that's not funny.

150
00:14:14,286 --> 00:14:15,553
Elliot?

151
00:14:22,829 --> 00:14:24,429
Hey.

152
00:14:25,497 --> 00:14:26,564
What's wrong?

153
00:14:57,329 --> 00:14:58,429
Hey.

154
00:15:00,866 --> 00:15:03,234
What's up, man?
Ah, little brother!

155
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:04,869
How's it going? Look at this place.
Fantastic.

156
00:15:04,871 --> 00:15:06,070
Hi, darlin'.

157
00:15:07,539 --> 00:15:09,073
Hi, uncle Elliot!

158
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:10,541
- Hey, niece Alice!
- Hey, hey.

159
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:15,246
Hey there.

160
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:17,849
Sorry we're so early.
Your brother's pathological.

161
00:15:17,851 --> 00:15:19,884
It's called being prompt
and professional.

162
00:15:19,886 --> 00:15:21,619
Virgil's awesome.
Thank you.

163
00:15:23,022 --> 00:15:25,690
Oh, hey.
Almost forgot.

164
00:15:25,692 --> 00:15:27,592
Here's your
housewarming present.

165
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:31,863
- You gonna help me drink it?
- No!

166
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,266
Look at this.

167
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:41,706
So a house off campus

168
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:44,442
with John Henry
and a live-in girlfriend.

169
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:47,078
You ready for this?
She's the one, Virgil.

170
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,947
She did all this herself.

171
00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:51,883
That's great. It's just,
you know, be smart.

172
00:15:51,885 --> 00:15:53,618
Be a student, man.

173
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:56,587
It's the last time to have no
responsibilities. Enjoy it.

174
00:15:56,589 --> 00:15:58,723
I don't want that.
I want what you have.

175
00:15:58,725 --> 00:16:01,092
An amazing wife,
an amazing daughter.

176
00:16:01,094 --> 00:16:03,728
Just don't rush it.

177
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:07,398
That's all out there waiting for you.
Believe me, what I have is great.

178
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,969
It is. But I missed
out on all this.

179
00:16:10,971 --> 00:16:14,238
I mean, what a college edu-ma-cation
could have done for me.

180
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,342
You have a scholarship, man. You
should be upstairs studying right now.

181
00:16:20,746 --> 00:16:23,548
Jesus. It's a good thing
you're not jealous.

182
00:16:24,616 --> 00:16:25,683
It is good.

183
00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:30,621
You got this. You got this.
Come on, come on.

184
00:16:30,623 --> 00:16:33,758
All right.
This one side.

185
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,194
- Oh!
- Oh, baby!

186
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:43,534
Thank you!

187
00:18:46,725 --> 00:18:48,893
An oldie old gold coin, huh?

188
00:18:48,895 --> 00:18:52,763
Yeah. I put it back on the
little table next to the bed.

189
00:18:52,765 --> 00:18:54,432
I didn't want to keep it.

190
00:18:54,434 --> 00:18:56,734
'Cause you're the best,
most honest, smartest, cutest,

191
00:18:56,736 --> 00:18:58,569
heaviest, oldest person here.

192
00:18:58,571 --> 00:19:01,239
I'm not the heaviest
or the oldest.

193
00:19:01,241 --> 00:19:02,974
Dad's the oldest
and he's the heaviest.

194
00:19:02,976 --> 00:19:04,609
What?

195
00:19:04,611 --> 00:19:06,144
She ratted me out.

196
00:19:07,112 --> 00:19:08,746
Here.

197
00:19:08,748 --> 00:19:10,648
Head bump. Oh.

198
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,250
Fist bump.

199
00:19:12,252 --> 00:19:14,919
That's John's room.
We're upstairs.

200
00:19:14,921 --> 00:19:16,420
All right, we're outta here.

201
00:19:16,422 --> 00:19:18,756
Buddy, great party.

202
00:19:18,758 --> 00:19:19,957
Be good.

203
00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:22,093
Bye, guys.

204
00:19:22,095 --> 00:19:23,528
Bye, Alice.

205
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:29,033
Kim? She's in
my lit class.

206
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:32,770
Girls who wear hats inside
are crazy.

207
00:19:32,772 --> 00:19:35,606
You know that, right? She's gonna do a
psychic cleansing after everyone leaves.

208
00:19:35,608 --> 00:19:37,842
Cool. Can I leave too?
No.

209
00:19:37,844 --> 00:19:40,511
She's just gonna burn some Sage,
and you are going to be nice.

210
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:43,714
Maybe you need a hat.

211
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:48,819
It's a twist-off.
Oh, thank you.

212
00:19:48,821 --> 00:19:50,621
John, do you think
this house is creepy?

213
00:19:50,623 --> 00:19:52,023
Mmm.
Yep.

214
00:19:52,025 --> 00:19:54,292
I don't, but I'm not a girl,

215
00:19:54,294 --> 00:19:57,295
and I think you should get dressed,
'cause we're playing baseball.

216
00:19:57,297 --> 00:20:01,065
Why do jocks always have to
play games, even at a party?

217
00:20:36,535 --> 00:20:38,469
"Don't think it.
Don't say it.

218
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:42,573
Don't think it. Don't say it.

219
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:44,742
Don't think it.
Don't say it.

220
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:47,545
Don't think it. Don't say it.

221
00:20:47,547 --> 00:20:49,747
Don't say it. Don't think it."

222
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:03,027
Miss Sasha
steps up to the plate!

223
00:21:03,029 --> 00:21:06,030
Oh, she's going long.
She's going long.

224
00:21:06,032 --> 00:21:08,032
Okay, all right, all right.
You got this?

225
00:21:08,034 --> 00:21:09,600
All right.

226
00:21:10,535 --> 00:21:12,436
- Oh!
- Fuck yes!

227
00:21:17,944 --> 00:21:19,543
Ah.
You all right?

228
00:21:19,545 --> 00:21:21,712
Yeah.
You're drunk.

229
00:21:21,714 --> 00:21:23,281
She's so drunk.
So...

230
00:21:23,283 --> 00:21:27,585
So you thought there
were sounds and... what?

231
00:21:27,587 --> 00:21:29,720
Bad vibrations?
Yeah.

232
00:21:29,722 --> 00:21:32,056
And now if they're gone,
then what's the big deal?

233
00:21:32,058 --> 00:21:34,592
We burned all
that bad shit away, right?

234
00:21:34,594 --> 00:21:36,894
That's tight.

235
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:39,063
You're actually psychic?
Sensitive.

236
00:21:39,065 --> 00:21:40,798
My mother says.
Oh, sensitive, huh?

237
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,734
So, what? Your mom locked you under
the stairs when you was a kid?

238
00:21:43,736 --> 00:21:45,469
You shoot knives at her?

239
00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:46,971
Yeah.

240
00:21:46,973 --> 00:21:48,906
- No.
- Fuck.

241
00:21:50,576 --> 00:21:52,243
But I could find stuff.

242
00:21:52,245 --> 00:21:55,279
I always knew when people
were coming over to the house.

243
00:21:55,281 --> 00:21:57,882
You know what I'm thinking?

244
00:21:59,584 --> 00:22:01,452
Yes.

245
00:22:01,454 --> 00:22:03,621
I might just do that.

246
00:22:03,623 --> 00:22:05,756
Damn.

247
00:22:05,758 --> 00:22:07,792
You are psychic.

248
00:22:07,794 --> 00:22:09,260
Sensitive there for sure.

249
00:22:11,431 --> 00:22:13,431
- Elliot...
- It's okay, Sasha.

250
00:22:13,433 --> 00:22:15,666
People have doubted me
my whole life.

251
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:18,436
Elliot, you can go ahead
and live a sheltered,

252
00:22:18,438 --> 00:22:20,304
shallow, physical existence.

253
00:22:20,306 --> 00:22:24,008
Ooh. A nonphysical existence
would be kind of tough.

254
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:27,511
What Aristotle is trying to say
is, um... well, he needs proof.

255
00:22:27,513 --> 00:22:29,046
Yeah.
Is that crazy?

256
00:22:32,818 --> 00:22:35,519
- Okay, let's just take some deep breaths.
- Okay.

257
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:43,461
So if nothing happens,
I should believe 'cause it means

258
00:22:43,463 --> 00:22:44,829
you got rid of the spirit?

259
00:22:44,831 --> 00:22:46,664
- Elliot, come on.
- What?

260
00:22:46,666 --> 00:22:48,466
We all know you don't
believe in this stuff,

261
00:22:48,468 --> 00:22:50,368
but can you just please
let her do it?

262
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:52,870
Right. Sorry.
No being rational.

263
00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:54,472
I give over. I do.
Yo, El,

264
00:22:54,474 --> 00:22:56,640
just loosen up the grip
a little bit.

265
00:22:56,642 --> 00:22:58,376
I'm trying to concentrate
on my breathing.

266
00:22:58,378 --> 00:23:00,978
Ah...

267
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:06,884
Are you ready, ladies?

268
00:23:06,886 --> 00:23:08,853
Okay, let's do
this thing. Come on.

269
00:23:08,855 --> 00:23:12,823
Now, I have no ego about it,
but... I do know this stuff.

270
00:23:12,825 --> 00:23:15,092
Okay, cool.
Well, what do you know?

271
00:23:16,995 --> 00:23:18,229
Okay.

272
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:31,976
I know your parents died
in a crash.

273
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:38,582
- Dude. -He didn't tell me.
They did.

274
00:23:39,851 --> 00:23:42,286
Bro.
I didn't say anything.

275
00:23:43,188 --> 00:23:44,188
Swear.

276
00:23:46,525 --> 00:23:47,525
Never tell anyone that.

277
00:23:49,394 --> 00:23:51,095
They're worried
about you though.

278
00:23:51,097 --> 00:23:54,398
All right. I'm sorry I laughed at
you before, but that's not funny.

279
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,735
I'm not being funny, Elliot.
This is just what I'm getting.

280
00:23:57,737 --> 00:23:59,170
Okay, how did they die?

281
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:02,706
What kind of accident was it?

282
00:24:02,708 --> 00:24:06,377
Your brother will do anything
in his power to protect you now.

283
00:24:06,379 --> 00:24:09,246
But they worry
that he's taking on too much.

284
00:24:09,248 --> 00:24:11,749
All right. So you talked
to my brother tonight.

285
00:24:11,751 --> 00:24:14,318
Sasha, your...

286
00:24:15,921 --> 00:24:19,223
Your grandmother has some
biscuits or rolls or something.

287
00:24:19,225 --> 00:24:20,658
Gam's rolls?

288
00:24:23,228 --> 00:24:25,896
Come on. Everybody's grandma
bakes biscuits.

289
00:24:25,898 --> 00:24:29,133
Yeah, he's, uh...
He's not wrong about that.

290
00:24:29,135 --> 00:24:31,235
This is... this is...

291
00:24:31,237 --> 00:24:33,070
- You know what?
- You want to blindfold me too?

292
00:24:33,072 --> 00:24:35,573
Just hang on.

293
00:24:35,575 --> 00:24:37,308
I'll take you up on that.

294
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:39,910
- I'm all down for the blindfolding,
whatever you got. -Of course.

295
00:24:56,261 --> 00:24:59,096
Okay. What'd I hide?
Where'd I hide it?

296
00:24:59,098 --> 00:25:00,498
- Oh, come on. That's crazy.
- Elliot...

297
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,832
Shh!

298
00:25:10,275 --> 00:25:13,711
You know what? I...
I don't like this.

299
00:25:17,949 --> 00:25:20,985
Yeah, i... I don't want to
do this anymore.

300
00:25:20,987 --> 00:25:23,988
Maybe this was a bad idea.
Nah, come on.

301
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:26,056
You're a good faker.
I admit it.

302
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:29,627
You put the keys
in a pot on the stove.

303
00:25:29,629 --> 00:25:31,262
Did you?

304
00:25:35,967 --> 00:25:37,535
You heard.

305
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:40,804
You were listening for it,
weren't you?

306
00:25:40,806 --> 00:25:43,641
Well... well, i... i didn't hear that.
Did you?

307
00:25:43,643 --> 00:25:44,875
No.

308
00:25:44,877 --> 00:25:47,111
- Something's coming.
- What?

309
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,080
They're saying...

310
00:25:51,816 --> 00:25:53,083
Don't...

311
00:25:54,819 --> 00:25:56,253
Don't think it.

312
00:25:57,322 --> 00:25:58,422
Don't say it.

313
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:03,994
Don't say it. Don't think it.

314
00:26:03,996 --> 00:26:05,896
Don't say it.
Don't think it.

315
00:26:05,898 --> 00:26:07,731
Don't say it. Don't think it.

316
00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:10,334
Don't say it! Don't think it!
Don't say it! Don't think it!

317
00:26:10,336 --> 00:26:12,703
Don't say it! Don't think it!
Don't say it! Don't think it!

318
00:26:12,705 --> 00:26:15,172
Don't say it! Don't think it!
Don't say it! Don't think it!

319
00:26:17,577 --> 00:26:19,543
Don't say or think what?

320
00:26:19,545 --> 00:26:21,512
The bye bye man.

321
00:26:21,514 --> 00:26:23,747
- Aaah!
- What the... Jesus!

322
00:26:23,749 --> 00:26:25,249
What the fuck?

323
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:29,687
Oh, Kim?
Oh, my god.

324
00:26:29,689 --> 00:26:32,189
Hey.

325
00:26:32,191 --> 00:26:34,258
- What happened, Kim? Are you all right?
- Kim?

326
00:27:19,939 --> 00:27:21,572
Hmm?

327
00:27:21,574 --> 00:27:22,806
Sorry.

328
00:27:22,808 --> 00:27:24,642
What are you doing?
Nothing. Nothing.

329
00:27:24,644 --> 00:27:26,176
Sorry.

330
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:33,083
Are you sick?

331
00:27:33,085 --> 00:27:35,185
Shh.
Shh.

332
00:27:36,454 --> 00:27:37,621
Good night.
Mmm.

333
00:27:37,623 --> 00:27:39,256
Love you.

334
00:27:39,258 --> 00:27:40,824
I love you, John.

335
00:27:42,127 --> 00:27:43,827
What?

336
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:46,930
Hey.

337
00:27:46,932 --> 00:27:48,365
You're joking, right?

338
00:27:49,968 --> 00:27:51,902
Sasha, you're kidding. Right?

339
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,041
What?

340
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:02,379
What the hell is that?
Hmm?

341
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:16,193
John!

342
00:28:16,195 --> 00:28:18,228
- Go!
- Look, I'm trying.

343
00:28:27,373 --> 00:28:29,073
This?

344
00:28:36,148 --> 00:28:37,581
Aaah.

345
00:29:32,036 --> 00:29:33,971
- Hey.
- Shh!

346
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:37,941
What are you doing?

347
00:29:37,943 --> 00:29:39,810
Do you hear that?

348
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:45,149
What the hell is that?

349
00:30:03,434 --> 00:30:05,335
You ready?

350
00:30:38,102 --> 00:30:40,037
Thanks for being nice
to me last night.

351
00:30:41,639 --> 00:30:44,341
- That was pretty crazy.
- It was.

352
00:30:44,343 --> 00:30:45,475
Definitely.

353
00:30:45,477 --> 00:30:47,511
You want to go inside?

354
00:30:47,513 --> 00:30:49,012
My roommate's car isn't here.

355
00:30:53,151 --> 00:30:54,518
We could try again.

356
00:30:56,788 --> 00:30:58,388
These things happen, right?

357
00:30:59,457 --> 00:31:00,891
Well, actually...

358
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:04,094
Not to me they don't.

359
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:06,096
Yeah.

360
00:31:07,298 --> 00:31:09,399
Actually, not to me either.

361
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:14,738
Guy not finishing up? I've
never had that happen before.

362
00:31:16,474 --> 00:31:17,908
Come on.

363
00:31:20,011 --> 00:31:21,712
I'm hungry.

364
00:31:21,714 --> 00:31:23,413
Jesus.

365
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:28,018
What?

366
00:31:29,822 --> 00:31:31,054
N-nothing.

367
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:34,558
Nothing, okay?
Kim, i...

368
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:35,926
I-I need to go.

369
00:31:37,161 --> 00:31:38,729
Now.

370
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:45,869
Fuck.

371
00:32:17,535 --> 00:32:18,936
Dude, check this out.

372
00:32:21,205 --> 00:32:22,739
They were already there, right?

373
00:32:22,741 --> 00:32:24,908
No.

374
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:27,544
It was Colin or one of those
douches from last night.

375
00:32:27,546 --> 00:32:29,880
No, listen. I heard it.

376
00:32:29,882 --> 00:32:32,916
I heard something after the party.
Outside, scratching.

377
00:32:32,918 --> 00:32:34,685
What do you mean
you heard something?

378
00:32:44,562 --> 00:32:45,996
Morning.

379
00:32:47,398 --> 00:32:50,834
See, you are clean
and beautiful.

380
00:32:56,741 --> 00:32:58,175
That's nice.

381
00:33:04,449 --> 00:33:06,750
What was that?

382
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:12,522
- John, you drive Kim home?
- Yeah.

383
00:33:13,758 --> 00:33:16,159
And now I gotta wash her off.

384
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:19,463
The girl's gross, man.
A total pig.

385
00:33:19,465 --> 00:33:21,665
Come on, man. That's not cool.
Don't say that.

386
00:33:21,667 --> 00:33:24,534
Oh, sure. Yeah, that's easy for you to say.
Your girlfriend's perfect.

387
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:35,512
Oh, god.

388
00:33:35,514 --> 00:33:37,981
You okay?

389
00:33:37,983 --> 00:33:40,784
I don't know. Maybe I shouldn't
be playing baseball in the cold.

390
00:33:40,786 --> 00:33:42,619
That's the problem
with being an alcoholic.

391
00:33:42,621 --> 00:33:44,821
Oh, shut up.
I didn't even drink that much.

392
00:33:44,823 --> 00:33:46,456
Maybe that was the mistake.

393
00:33:46,458 --> 00:33:48,191
I'll make you some tea.

394
00:33:57,301 --> 00:33:58,435
Mmm.

395
00:34:04,809 --> 00:34:06,643
Psst!

396
00:34:06,645 --> 00:34:07,778
Come on.

397
00:34:09,347 --> 00:34:10,480
Hmm?

398
00:34:10,482 --> 00:34:12,416
Fuck him.

399
00:34:19,657 --> 00:34:20,857
Uh...

400
00:34:34,005 --> 00:34:36,306
Bear, you went away there
for a second.

401
00:34:37,175 --> 00:34:38,408
I did?

402
00:34:41,346 --> 00:34:42,612
Where'd you go?

403
00:34:45,383 --> 00:34:47,284
God, you're shivering.

404
00:34:50,221 --> 00:34:51,955
I was just thinking.

405
00:34:54,392 --> 00:34:55,926
About John?

406
00:35:35,733 --> 00:35:37,434
<i>No, little brother, it's cool.</i>

407
00:35:37,436 --> 00:35:39,970
<i>You can call me anytime.
You know that.</i>

408
00:35:39,972 --> 00:35:42,439
Are you... are you really
taking on too much?

409
00:35:42,441 --> 00:35:44,107
Are you worried about
protecting me?

410
00:35:44,109 --> 00:35:45,909
<i>What is going on?</i>

411
00:35:45,911 --> 00:35:48,278
Is it Sasha?

412
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,847
Yeah, sh-she's been
really sick and scared.

413
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:53,583
And John's been acting weird.

414
00:35:53,585 --> 00:35:55,385
You guys seemed
like you were great.

415
00:35:56,921 --> 00:35:58,955
But were we?

416
00:35:58,957 --> 00:36:01,124
You saw them dancing together.

417
00:36:01,126 --> 00:36:03,527
Talk to me, buddy.
What's going on?

418
00:36:07,799 --> 00:36:09,232
<i>Elliot.</i>

419
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:14,971
- What? -You wanna
get lunch tomorrow,

420
00:36:14,973 --> 00:36:16,940
we'll talk about this then?

421
00:36:16,942 --> 00:36:19,843
You know what?
Listen, I gotta go.

422
00:36:19,845 --> 00:36:21,678
There's something I gotta...

423
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,813
I gotta deal with something.

424
00:36:23,815 --> 00:36:26,349
El?

425
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:32,889
Guys.

426
00:36:37,628 --> 00:36:39,663
Guys, what are you
doing up there?

427
00:37:45,696 --> 00:37:47,397
Hello?

428
00:37:47,399 --> 00:37:48,932
Anyone down there?

429
00:38:00,211 --> 00:38:01,711
Hello.

430
00:38:20,732 --> 00:38:22,165
Hello?

431
00:39:04,942 --> 00:39:08,178
Guys! Help!

432
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:09,346
What?

433
00:39:12,283 --> 00:39:14,884
No! Guys!

434
00:39:17,321 --> 00:39:19,456
What are you doing, Elliot?

435
00:39:19,458 --> 00:39:22,025
- You were here the whole time?
- Yes.

436
00:39:22,027 --> 00:39:23,293
That's bullshit.

437
00:39:23,295 --> 00:39:24,794
We were, Elliot.

438
00:39:24,796 --> 00:39:26,162
You didn't answer me.

439
00:39:26,164 --> 00:39:28,631
- We didn't hear you.
- What were you doing?

440
00:39:28,633 --> 00:39:31,468
Studying. Talking.

441
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:33,136
- You didn't hear me?
- We weren't doing anything.

442
00:39:33,138 --> 00:39:35,472
- You didn't hear me?
- Elliot, for the last time, bro,

443
00:39:35,474 --> 00:39:36,873
we wouldn't do that to you!

444
00:39:36,875 --> 00:39:38,174
Why are you lying to me?

445
00:39:38,176 --> 00:39:39,476
We're not!
Jesus Christ!

446
00:39:39,478 --> 00:39:42,145
Then what just happened?
And there were sounds.

447
00:39:42,147 --> 00:39:43,513
I mean, come on.

448
00:39:43,515 --> 00:39:46,516
I told you
there was something happening.

449
00:39:46,518 --> 00:39:48,017
Now do you believe me?

450
00:39:48,019 --> 00:39:49,853
Hey.

451
00:39:49,855 --> 00:39:51,855
Don't worry, okay? What are you doing?
Don't do that.

452
00:39:51,857 --> 00:39:53,323
- Don't do what?
- Don't...

453
00:39:53,325 --> 00:39:54,691
Elliot...
Don't touch her.

454
00:39:54,693 --> 00:39:55,892
What?
Don't touch her.

455
00:39:55,894 --> 00:39:57,260
You are a crazy paranoid, bro!

456
00:40:02,334 --> 00:40:04,234
Yeah, you're a little warm.

457
00:40:06,003 --> 00:40:07,937
Okay, so you weren't with John.

458
00:40:09,173 --> 00:40:11,207
Am I hearing things?

459
00:40:11,209 --> 00:40:12,609
Am I seeing things?

460
00:40:16,914 --> 00:40:20,550
Tonight, you thought the house
was empty when we were here.

461
00:40:20,552 --> 00:40:22,819
You went away, Elliot.

462
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:32,462
I kind of went away too.

463
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:44,741
- What?
- I sat down to study.

464
00:40:44,743 --> 00:40:47,010
I don't remember
doing any of that.

465
00:40:53,083 --> 00:40:54,951
It's like now that
I know his name,

466
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,021
he's coming for me.

467
00:41:00,558 --> 00:41:03,193
And the more I try to get rid
of it, the bigger it gets.

468
00:41:04,895 --> 00:41:06,396
It's horrible.

469
00:41:06,398 --> 00:41:08,698
Hey, babe.

470
00:41:12,269 --> 00:41:14,604
Bye bye man's not real.

471
00:41:14,606 --> 00:41:16,606
It's just something
that's in our heads.

472
00:41:16,608 --> 00:41:18,808
That's real.

473
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:21,144
Ideas are real.

474
00:41:21,146 --> 00:41:22,479
If it's not...

475
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:27,016
Then, Elliot, we're all losing
our minds at the same time.

476
00:41:29,453 --> 00:41:31,354
And what are the chances
of that?

477
00:42:23,507 --> 00:42:24,974
What the hell is that?

478
00:42:24,976 --> 00:42:26,109
What is it?

479
00:42:34,018 --> 00:42:35,585
What?

480
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:41,791
Elliot, there's nothing here.

481
00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:54,370
So, you're not
gonna be late, right?

482
00:42:54,372 --> 00:42:57,340
No, I'll meet you at 2:00
sharp, right where we parked.

483
00:42:57,342 --> 00:43:00,009
I'm gonna find out
how real this thing is.

484
00:43:00,011 --> 00:43:02,011
The name.

485
00:43:02,013 --> 00:43:03,846
You're gonna talk to the
landlord about the furniture?

486
00:43:03,848 --> 00:43:05,515
And the house.

487
00:43:05,517 --> 00:43:07,617
Maybe he can find
somewhere else.

488
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:11,688
You're feeling better though?

489
00:43:11,690 --> 00:43:16,025
I guess. It's hard to be scared
in the middle of the day.

490
00:43:16,027 --> 00:43:19,128
I'm gonna take care of you.

491
00:43:22,734 --> 00:43:24,267
Oh, my god.

492
00:43:24,269 --> 00:43:26,369
Ugh.
You're shivering.

493
00:43:26,371 --> 00:43:28,605
I'm gonna figure this out.
I promise.

494
00:43:28,607 --> 00:43:31,441
I'll see you at 2:00.
I love you.

495
00:43:31,443 --> 00:43:32,642
I love you.

496
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:39,609
"Register archive.
Dead file 69. Redmon."

497
00:44:42,647 --> 00:44:44,614
Here, put these on.

498
00:44:44,616 --> 00:44:46,783
Really?
Yeah.

499
00:44:46,785 --> 00:44:48,951
They're originals, and we
don't want your sweaty palms

500
00:44:48,953 --> 00:44:51,120
messing up the documents
in the box.

501
00:44:53,791 --> 00:44:57,160
Now, the dead file
has dead articles...

502
00:44:57,162 --> 00:45:00,363
Material that got killed
before going to press

503
00:45:00,365 --> 00:45:02,198
but still saved for posterity.

504
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:03,900
And it was written by Redmon.

505
00:45:07,671 --> 00:45:08,805
Thanks.
Mm-hmm.

506
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:24,954
Thank you, Dennis!

507
00:45:33,397 --> 00:45:35,832
Mr. Daizy?
Yes. How are you doing?

508
00:45:35,834 --> 00:45:38,701
Not so great actually.

509
00:45:38,703 --> 00:45:42,672
Uh, me and my friends are renting
your place out in sun prairie.

510
00:45:42,674 --> 00:45:44,006
37 oak Dale?

511
00:45:44,008 --> 00:45:47,176
Oh, yeah, the two handsome guys.
Are you with them?

512
00:45:47,178 --> 00:45:49,879
You have a weird house,
Mr. Daizy.

513
00:45:49,881 --> 00:45:51,681
Really. It...

514
00:45:51,683 --> 00:45:53,549
I-It's awful.

515
00:45:53,551 --> 00:45:56,385
Well, I'm sorry that you feel that
way, but they did sign a lease.

516
00:45:58,690 --> 00:45:59,889
Bless you.

517
00:45:59,891 --> 00:46:01,257
Sorry.

518
00:46:01,259 --> 00:46:02,725
You okay?

519
00:46:02,727 --> 00:46:04,527
It's really cold in here.

520
00:46:04,529 --> 00:46:06,863
It's a hothouse. It's actually
not cold at all, honey.

521
00:46:06,865 --> 00:46:09,365
Maybe you should be home in bed.

522
00:46:09,367 --> 00:46:11,434
Look, Mr. Daizy.

523
00:46:11,436 --> 00:46:14,537
There was a old nightstand
in the basement,

524
00:46:14,539 --> 00:46:16,472
and it has
this writing inside it.

525
00:46:18,876 --> 00:46:21,477
Where did it come from?
A nightstand?

526
00:46:27,551 --> 00:46:31,154
Let's begin by considering
this wall behind me.

527
00:46:32,556 --> 00:46:35,391
Now, we can all agree
that the sentence...

528
00:46:35,393 --> 00:46:37,026
I'm sorry.
Yeah, have a seat.

529
00:46:38,395 --> 00:46:41,230
Now, we can all agree
that this sentence,

530
00:46:41,232 --> 00:46:45,735
"this is a wall,"
is a truth claim.

531
00:46:45,737 --> 00:46:48,070
This wall is real.
I see it, you see it.

532
00:46:48,072 --> 00:46:49,605
We can touch it.

533
00:46:49,607 --> 00:46:53,442
Likewise, if I were to brush
a few atoms from this wall,

534
00:46:53,444 --> 00:46:55,912
it would still be here
before us.

535
00:46:55,914 --> 00:46:58,247
It would still be
"the wall."

536
00:46:58,249 --> 00:47:04,320
But what if I continue
to slowly brush the atoms

537
00:47:04,322 --> 00:47:07,023
one by one away from this wall?

538
00:47:08,292 --> 00:47:10,927
At first you'd say,
"it's still a wall."

539
00:47:10,929 --> 00:47:13,362
I brush a few more.
"Well, it's still a wall."

540
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:16,933
But...
What if I remove

541
00:47:16,935 --> 00:47:20,603
every single atom from
this wall except for one?

542
00:47:20,605 --> 00:47:25,007
And you've seen me brush
every single atom from this wall

543
00:47:25,009 --> 00:47:29,512
except for that one atom,
and I point to it and I say,

544
00:47:29,514 --> 00:47:30,913
"there. That's what's left.

545
00:47:32,115 --> 00:47:33,950
That's the wall."

546
00:47:33,952 --> 00:47:35,885
Now, is it?

547
00:47:38,789 --> 00:47:40,623
Is that the wall?

548
00:47:40,625 --> 00:47:42,525
What the fu...

549
00:47:42,527 --> 00:47:44,227
All right, John?

550
00:47:45,629 --> 00:47:46,996
Welcome back.

551
00:47:46,998 --> 00:47:50,199
Language and reality

552
00:47:50,201 --> 00:47:52,969
inform each other
as we construct...

553
00:47:52,971 --> 00:47:55,638
Okay, I'm looking up
the bye bye man, right?

554
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:58,341
There's nothing online, so I type
in "don't say it, don't think it,"

555
00:47:58,343 --> 00:48:01,477
and it led me here,
the dead archives and Redmon.

556
00:48:01,479 --> 00:48:03,279
Here's what was in his folder.

557
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:10,186
I think you write it and repeat
it to try and keep from saying...

558
00:48:10,188 --> 00:48:11,988
The bye bye man.

559
00:48:11,990 --> 00:48:13,789
Okay, but why is that
in the dead files?

560
00:48:16,193 --> 00:48:18,194
October 18, 1969.

561
00:48:18,196 --> 00:48:20,663
Byline Larry Redmon.
Deerfield, Iowa.

562
00:48:20,665 --> 00:48:22,398
A teenager,

563
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:25,501
accused of murdering his own
family and four other youths.

564
00:48:25,503 --> 00:48:27,837
When asked by this reporter
why he would do such a thing,

565
00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:31,007
he replied,
"the bye bye man made me do it."

566
00:48:31,009 --> 00:48:35,177
It's an article about a kid who went
crazy, but it was never published.

567
00:48:35,179 --> 00:48:37,179
And Larry Redmon, the writer,

568
00:48:37,181 --> 00:48:39,348
he was pretty infamous locally.

569
00:48:39,350 --> 00:48:42,184
After he killed this piece
about the kid in deerfield,

570
00:48:42,186 --> 00:48:45,254
Larry Redmon took
a shotgun and murdered

571
00:48:45,256 --> 00:48:48,691
eight friends and family
members right here in Madison.

572
00:48:48,693 --> 00:48:50,092
Mom, run!
Don't say it.

573
00:48:50,094 --> 00:48:52,528
Don't think it.
Don't say it.

574
00:48:52,530 --> 00:48:55,097
Don't think it.
Don't say it.

575
00:48:55,099 --> 00:48:58,534
- Mom, shut the door!
- Giselle!

576
00:48:58,536 --> 00:48:59,769
Who'd you tell?

577
00:49:02,239 --> 00:49:03,539
No one!

578
00:49:03,541 --> 00:49:05,541
We didn't tell anyone, Larry!

579
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:10,746
Mommy!

580
00:49:10,748 --> 00:49:13,049
Stop!

581
00:49:13,051 --> 00:49:15,718
We didn't tell anyone!
I swear we didn't say anything!

582
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:17,186
Get back! Please!

583
00:49:22,392 --> 00:49:24,660
Maybe he got inspired
by what he was writing about.

584
00:49:39,076 --> 00:49:40,609
Oh!

585
00:50:30,293 --> 00:50:31,894
You won't win.

586
00:50:33,296 --> 00:50:35,231
I won't let you.

587
00:51:06,663 --> 00:51:10,733
There are no other mentions
of these cases anywhere else.

588
00:51:10,735 --> 00:51:13,169
It's like someone
redacted the whole story

589
00:51:13,171 --> 00:51:14,837
so no one else could read it.

590
00:51:14,839 --> 00:51:16,839
Why would anyone do that?

591
00:51:16,841 --> 00:51:20,042
Well, obviously
he was bat-shit crazy.

592
00:51:20,044 --> 00:51:21,911
But if you remove all references

593
00:51:21,913 --> 00:51:23,846
to something in the past,

594
00:51:23,848 --> 00:51:26,082
that past no longer exists.

595
00:51:26,084 --> 00:51:29,518
Even the idea of it is gone.

596
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:32,721
Maybe somebody wanted to make this
bye bye man disappear permanently.

597
00:51:32,723 --> 00:51:35,758
And you've got the last record
of it right there.

598
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:37,326
I'll be back.

599
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:43,632
Good. I have time.

600
00:51:50,874 --> 00:51:52,341
Don't write it either, idiot.

601
00:52:40,157 --> 00:52:42,024
What are you doing, boy?

602
00:52:43,426 --> 00:52:45,427
Are you out of your mind?

603
00:52:45,429 --> 00:52:46,662
I, um...

604
00:52:46,664 --> 00:52:48,764
What is wrong with you, Elliot?

605
00:52:48,766 --> 00:52:50,366
What the...
Huh?

606
00:52:52,269 --> 00:52:54,370
I'm-I'm sorry. I need to go.
I'm late.

607
00:52:55,438 --> 00:52:57,072
Elliot!

608
00:53:27,805 --> 00:53:30,406
Oh, my god.

609
00:53:38,715 --> 00:53:40,115
Sasha!

610
00:53:41,651 --> 00:53:43,052
Hey, John!

611
00:53:43,054 --> 00:53:44,253
Sasha!

612
00:53:49,659 --> 00:53:51,260
Hey.

613
00:54:30,533 --> 00:54:31,600
Hello?

614
00:54:31,602 --> 00:54:33,402
Kim, it's Elliot.

615
00:54:33,404 --> 00:54:36,705
Elliot. Uh, god, I was just
thinking about you guys.

616
00:54:36,707 --> 00:54:38,374
<i>You wanna come up?</i>
Listen, listen.

617
00:54:38,376 --> 00:54:39,708
Um, what are you doing?

618
00:54:39,710 --> 00:54:42,244
You mean right now,
or since the party?

619
00:54:42,246 --> 00:54:44,046
<i>Isn't that why you're here?</i>

620
00:54:44,048 --> 00:54:47,216
Kim, can you come down?
I want to do another séance.

621
00:54:47,218 --> 00:54:49,218
<i>Right now.
With all four of us.</i>

622
00:54:49,220 --> 00:54:51,053
<i>At the house.</i>

623
00:54:51,055 --> 00:54:52,621
<i>Listen, you were right.</i>

624
00:54:54,591 --> 00:54:55,991
I was wrong.

625
00:54:58,228 --> 00:55:00,095
Sure.

626
00:55:00,097 --> 00:55:01,697
I'll be down in a sec.

627
00:55:18,748 --> 00:55:21,317
The bye bye man doesn't exist
anywhere else that I could find.

628
00:55:21,319 --> 00:55:23,385
You don't have to
look for him, Elliot.

629
00:55:24,954 --> 00:55:26,488
He's found us.

630
00:55:28,158 --> 00:55:31,427
You can't help
thinking about him.

631
00:55:31,429 --> 00:55:33,696
And the more you think
about him, the closer he gets.

632
00:55:36,766 --> 00:55:39,435
You see things
that aren't there.

633
00:55:39,437 --> 00:55:41,770
You don't see things
that are there.

634
00:55:41,772 --> 00:55:44,940
Or hear things,
like a coin rolling.

635
00:55:44,942 --> 00:55:46,208
Yeah.

636
00:55:47,110 --> 00:55:48,110
Like a train.

637
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:56,885
Some people catch it
and it spreads.

638
00:55:58,788 --> 00:56:01,857
Some go crazy sooner,
but they all die in the end.

639
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:06,228
The word spreads,
and he comes to you with...

640
00:56:09,132 --> 00:56:11,200
With that<i> thing.</i>

641
00:56:14,537 --> 00:56:16,572
I told Katie.

642
00:56:18,641 --> 00:56:20,042
I didn't want to.

643
00:56:21,478 --> 00:56:24,146
What can you do with cancer
but cut it out?

644
00:56:24,148 --> 00:56:27,416
You have to stop it before
it spreads and every cell dies.

645
00:56:30,553 --> 00:56:33,389
This could spread everywhere
if we don't cut it out.

646
00:56:34,824 --> 00:56:36,191
Did you tell anyone?

647
00:56:36,193 --> 00:56:38,694
Mrs. Watkins,
the librarian.

648
00:56:41,998 --> 00:56:43,832
We have to get to her too.

649
00:56:43,834 --> 00:56:45,901
What do you mean
you have to get to her?

650
00:56:47,504 --> 00:56:48,670
Stop!

651
00:56:48,672 --> 00:56:50,572
Oh, my god!

652
00:56:50,574 --> 00:56:51,673
Stop!

653
00:56:51,675 --> 00:56:52,775
Elliot, stop!

654
00:56:57,347 --> 00:56:58,781
Let me help you!

655
00:57:05,688 --> 00:57:07,022
Kim! Wait!

656
00:57:07,024 --> 00:57:08,024
Kim!

657
00:57:08,591 --> 00:57:10,025
Kim!

658
00:57:10,027 --> 00:57:11,226
Kim!

659
00:57:11,228 --> 00:57:12,861
No!

660
00:57:12,863 --> 00:57:15,197
- We have to help them!
- What do you see?

661
00:57:15,199 --> 00:57:17,533
- It's a family!
- It's in your head!

662
00:57:17,535 --> 00:57:19,034
No, Kim!

663
00:57:19,036 --> 00:57:20,769
There's a train!
A real train!

664
00:57:23,207 --> 00:57:24,706
No!

665
00:57:24,708 --> 00:57:26,041
Kim! Move!

666
00:57:26,043 --> 00:57:27,342
It's in your head!

667
00:57:29,546 --> 00:57:30,546
Kim!

668
00:57:35,552 --> 00:57:37,853
Kim! No!

669
00:57:39,389 --> 00:57:40,989
No!

670
00:58:18,428 --> 00:58:19,862
Just any comment.

671
00:58:28,438 --> 00:58:30,506
<i>It's on the way down here</i>

672
00:58:30,508 --> 00:58:32,474
<i>because there's just
a big tie-up down there.</i>

673
00:58:41,851 --> 00:58:43,852
Elliot, what happened?

674
00:58:43,854 --> 00:58:45,420
Kim. She's dead.

675
00:58:46,489 --> 00:58:48,457
Aw, shit.
Jesus.

676
00:58:48,459 --> 00:58:50,926
Oh, my god. It was him.
He killed her.

677
00:58:52,295 --> 00:58:54,129
You were right. He's
trying to get inside us.

678
00:58:54,131 --> 00:58:55,964
He got in her.
He's gonna drive us crazy.

679
00:58:55,966 --> 00:58:57,833
He's gonna kill us.
You mean the...

680
00:58:57,835 --> 00:59:00,636
Yeah. He's why
I was late to get you.

681
00:59:00,638 --> 00:59:01,870
He's why you're feeling sick.

682
00:59:03,506 --> 00:59:05,140
Have you said the name
to anyone?

683
00:59:05,142 --> 00:59:06,975
The name? No. N-no.

684
00:59:06,977 --> 00:59:08,176
Have you?

685
00:59:08,178 --> 00:59:09,845
No, I-i haven't said...

686
00:59:09,847 --> 00:59:12,314
Good. Don't. We can't say the
name to anyone else, ever.

687
00:59:12,316 --> 00:59:13,982
You gonna tell me
what to do now?

688
00:59:13,984 --> 00:59:16,184
- Swear you won't say the name
so we don't spread it. -No.

689
00:59:16,186 --> 00:59:17,886
John, please.

690
00:59:17,888 --> 00:59:19,321
Please.
Bro, swear it.

691
00:59:19,323 --> 00:59:21,089
You just need to cut this shit.
You swear!

692
00:59:22,992 --> 00:59:24,192
Swear!
No.

693
00:59:24,194 --> 00:59:25,994
- You swear!
- Elliot, stop it!

694
00:59:25,996 --> 00:59:27,829
Swear!
What's wrong with you, Elliot?

695
00:59:27,831 --> 00:59:29,364
- What's wrong with you, huh?
- Hey, guys!

696
00:59:29,366 --> 00:59:30,832
Hey! Break it up!

697
00:59:30,834 --> 00:59:32,901
I said break it up right now!

698
00:59:33,403 --> 00:59:35,504
Back up.

699
00:59:35,506 --> 00:59:37,573
- He got to you, didn't he?
- No one got to me.

700
00:59:37,575 --> 00:59:40,075
Admit it. He's making
you feel angry.

701
00:59:40,077 --> 00:59:42,678
- He's making you sick.
- Yeah? He's making you crazy.

702
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:45,013
- You on something?
- No, I'm upset.

703
00:59:45,015 --> 00:59:46,348
We're just having
a little argument.

704
00:59:46,350 --> 00:59:48,417
You call that a little argument?

705
00:59:48,419 --> 00:59:51,119
John, please.
Please don't say it.

706
00:59:52,255 --> 00:59:53,555
Don't say what?

707
00:59:53,557 --> 00:59:54,557
Sasha?

708
00:59:55,091 --> 00:59:56,425
I won't.

709
00:59:56,427 --> 00:59:58,794
J, you can't.

710
01:00:02,031 --> 01:00:05,267
This name of some stupid shit
Elliot thinks is dangerous.

711
01:00:07,036 --> 01:00:12,240
Yes, I was talking about Kim.
There was a hammer in her bag.

712
01:00:12,242 --> 01:00:13,742
It was covered with blood.

713
01:00:13,744 --> 01:00:14,810
Oh, my god.

714
01:00:16,546 --> 01:00:19,047
Train's engineer
said that you were chasing Kim

715
01:00:19,049 --> 01:00:21,083
with the hammer.

716
01:00:21,085 --> 01:00:23,385
He said she was crying for help

717
01:00:23,387 --> 01:00:27,055
and that she jumped out of
your car to get away from you.

718
01:00:27,057 --> 01:00:29,224
Jesus Christ.
Elliot?

719
01:00:29,226 --> 01:00:31,460
That's not what happened.
No?

720
01:00:31,462 --> 01:00:33,962
They found Kim's roommate,
Katie Williams.

721
01:00:35,465 --> 01:00:37,132
She was killed by a hammer too,

722
01:00:37,134 --> 01:00:39,234
but you knew that, didn't you?

723
01:00:39,236 --> 01:00:40,902
I... Sasha, no.

724
01:00:40,904 --> 01:00:43,739
I was at the library.
He made me lose track of time.

725
01:00:43,741 --> 01:00:44,806
You have...

726
01:00:44,808 --> 01:00:46,575
Sasha.

727
01:00:46,577 --> 01:00:48,944
You wanna talk to me here,
tell me what's going on?

728
01:00:48,946 --> 01:00:51,106
- Don't say it. Don't think it.
You were right. -Quiet.

729
01:00:52,982 --> 01:00:54,750
Sasha, what doesn't
he want you to say?

730
01:00:54,752 --> 01:00:55,817
Yeah, sash.

731
01:00:55,819 --> 01:00:57,552
You! Shut it!

732
01:01:08,264 --> 01:01:10,265
It just happened, John.

733
01:01:10,267 --> 01:01:11,466
You see that? It's him.

734
01:01:11,468 --> 01:01:12,534
No.

735
01:01:14,103 --> 01:01:15,170
Sasha.

736
01:01:16,272 --> 01:01:18,540
What... what is it?

737
01:01:20,943 --> 01:01:21,943
Blood.

738
01:01:27,650 --> 01:01:29,351
Blood?

739
01:01:29,353 --> 01:01:30,419
Where?

740
01:01:32,188 --> 01:01:34,556
What do you see?
He makes you see things.

741
01:01:41,330 --> 01:01:42,798
She... he's...

742
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:44,533
Fuck.

743
01:01:44,535 --> 01:01:46,468
Oh, my god.
Hey, hey. Hey!

744
01:01:46,470 --> 01:01:48,370
Back away.
I need you over here.

745
01:01:49,506 --> 01:01:51,406
She's fine.
Stay back.

746
01:01:55,511 --> 01:01:57,412
Wait. There he is.

747
01:02:01,150 --> 01:02:02,417
Hey, man.

748
01:02:06,356 --> 01:02:08,490
Hey, bud, something wrong?

749
01:02:08,492 --> 01:02:09,691
I'm... I'm sorry.
What?

750
01:02:09,693 --> 01:02:10,859
I thought...

751
01:02:10,861 --> 01:02:13,562
Hey. You all right?

752
01:02:18,401 --> 01:02:20,168
Wait.
Wait, Sasha.

753
01:02:20,170 --> 01:02:23,004
He's gonna take her home, and
she's gonna lie down for a bit.

754
01:02:23,006 --> 01:02:24,573
I'm her boyfriend.
She needs<i> me.</i>

755
01:02:24,575 --> 01:02:25,874
Maybe.
Maybe later.

756
01:02:25,876 --> 01:02:27,843
But right now you're
gonna come with me.

757
01:02:27,845 --> 01:02:29,845
We're gonna talk a little bit.

758
01:02:29,847 --> 01:02:31,847
Did you say the name to anyone?

759
01:02:31,849 --> 01:02:33,415
She didn't, man.

760
01:02:34,684 --> 01:02:36,418
Neither of us did.

761
01:02:50,066 --> 01:02:51,933
It's gonna be all right.

762
01:03:01,778 --> 01:03:04,212
Don't think it. Don't say it.
Don't think it. Don't say it.

763
01:03:04,214 --> 01:03:05,647
Don't think it. Don't think it.

764
01:03:07,250 --> 01:03:08,884
Don't say it.

765
01:03:22,098 --> 01:03:24,332
Good news for you, maybe.

766
01:03:26,569 --> 01:03:28,904
Kim Hines wrote a suicide note,

767
01:03:28,906 --> 01:03:31,406
taking responsibility
for her roommate

768
01:03:31,408 --> 01:03:33,942
and for the deaths of you

769
01:03:33,944 --> 01:03:35,977
and the other two
living at your house.

770
01:03:37,413 --> 01:03:39,548
So I guess she was planning
on killing you too.

771
01:03:41,117 --> 01:03:43,318
Is that what happened, Elliot?

772
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:45,654
You found out
and you chased her?

773
01:03:47,790 --> 01:03:49,324
I don't think that's murder.

774
01:03:49,326 --> 01:03:52,928
Don't think it.
Don't say it. Don't think it.

775
01:03:52,930 --> 01:03:54,262
Don't say it.
Don't think it.

776
01:03:54,264 --> 01:03:56,097
You want to write it?

777
01:03:56,099 --> 01:03:57,099
No.

778
01:03:58,668 --> 01:04:01,403
- You're going to tell me, you know that?
- I hope not.

779
01:04:03,973 --> 01:04:05,340
Why did you chase Kim?

780
01:04:05,342 --> 01:04:07,142
I told you.
I was trying to help her.

781
01:04:07,144 --> 01:04:08,910
So you chased her into a train?

782
01:04:10,279 --> 01:04:12,614
What are you doing?
You could lose everything.

783
01:04:12,616 --> 01:04:15,217
Your-your scholarship,
that pretty girl.

784
01:04:15,985 --> 01:04:17,786
You are a smart kid.

785
01:04:17,788 --> 01:04:21,523
Talk to me and i...
I can help you.

786
01:04:21,525 --> 01:04:24,626
Otherwise it'll be out of my hands,
and you'll be wishing that you had.

787
01:04:24,628 --> 01:04:27,229
You might find yourself
wishing I hadn't.

788
01:04:28,364 --> 01:04:30,198
Well, you let me
worry about that.

789
01:04:31,367 --> 01:04:33,702
You really want to know?

790
01:04:33,704 --> 01:04:36,872
You really think the truth...
Honesty... is the best policy?

791
01:04:36,874 --> 01:04:38,874
- I do.
- Always?

792
01:04:39,675 --> 01:04:40,909
When wouldn't it be?

793
01:04:42,211 --> 01:04:43,411
You have kids?

794
01:04:45,648 --> 01:04:46,848
Maybe.

795
01:04:46,850 --> 01:04:48,250
You have kids.

796
01:04:52,722 --> 01:04:54,322
Don't think it.
Don't say it.

797
01:04:56,994 --> 01:04:59,127
What if you saw the worst
crime scene ever?

798
01:05:01,163 --> 01:05:03,565
A mass murder at a school.

799
01:05:05,501 --> 01:05:09,971
With dead bodies and brains and students
and sneakers with blood on them.

800
01:05:11,874 --> 01:05:14,576
And you go home,

801
01:05:14,578 --> 01:05:16,745
and your kids say,

802
01:05:16,747 --> 01:05:18,413
"tell us about your day, mommy."

803
01:05:20,182 --> 01:05:22,250
You could be honest.

804
01:05:23,352 --> 01:05:25,854
You could tell the truth.

805
01:05:25,856 --> 01:05:29,257
You could describe every
awful nightmare thing you saw,

806
01:05:29,259 --> 01:05:33,094
and what was burned into your head would
be burned into their heads forever.

807
01:05:36,232 --> 01:05:37,632
Or...

808
01:05:39,068 --> 01:05:40,268
You could hug them tight.

809
01:05:42,571 --> 01:05:45,340
And spare them
your honest truth.

810
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:51,980
What would you do?

811
01:05:55,217 --> 01:05:56,785
I'd hug them.

812
01:05:58,921 --> 01:06:01,122
Please don't make me say it.

813
01:06:03,060 --> 01:06:05,026
I haven't hurt anyone.

814
01:06:06,395 --> 01:06:09,297
But I'm afraid of putting this
into your head.

815
01:06:12,768 --> 01:06:15,136
All I have to do is talk to you,

816
01:06:15,138 --> 01:06:17,038
and you and your kids...

817
01:06:18,574 --> 01:06:20,475
You're all dead.

818
01:06:23,913 --> 01:06:25,413
Hey, Elliot.

819
01:06:25,415 --> 01:06:27,782
Your friend died? What the
hell is going on, man?

820
01:06:27,784 --> 01:06:29,751
Thanks for coming to get me,
but I gotta go.

821
01:06:29,753 --> 01:06:32,988
Was it Sasha and John... hey, talk to me.
Let me help you.

822
01:06:32,990 --> 01:06:35,590
Whatever is going on,
there's nothing you can do.

823
01:06:35,592 --> 01:06:37,926
Okay? I literally
can't tell you.

824
01:06:37,928 --> 01:06:40,095
I'm not going to let it
happen to you, Virgil.

825
01:06:40,097 --> 01:06:42,564
Especially not you.
What are you talking about?

826
01:06:44,767 --> 01:06:47,002
You've got a family.
Go take care of them.

827
01:06:47,004 --> 01:06:48,436
Elliot. Hey!
<i>You</i> are my family.

828
01:06:48,438 --> 01:06:49,938
Elliot!

829
01:06:49,940 --> 01:06:51,873
Shit!

830
01:07:21,705 --> 01:07:23,538
Oh, fuck!

831
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:32,414
Yeah.

832
01:07:34,350 --> 01:07:35,817
Oh, my god.

833
01:07:46,696 --> 01:07:48,229
What are you doing, Elliot?

834
01:07:50,666 --> 01:07:53,101
What's... what's wrong
with you, Elliot?

835
01:08:02,511 --> 01:08:04,779
What the f...

836
01:08:06,582 --> 01:08:07,949
No.

837
01:08:10,086 --> 01:08:12,153
I'm so sorry.

838
01:08:23,399 --> 01:08:24,799
<i>Elliot?</i>

839
01:08:27,603 --> 01:08:29,871
Hi, Mrs. Watkins.
<i>Hi, Elliot.</i>

840
01:08:29,873 --> 01:08:32,273
I've been having
some really strange thoughts

841
01:08:32,275 --> 01:08:34,943
about that bye bye man
since we talked.

842
01:08:34,945 --> 01:08:36,511
Mrs. Watkins.

843
01:08:37,913 --> 01:08:40,115
Mrs. Watkins, you can't
talk to anyone about it.

844
01:08:40,117 --> 01:08:42,383
Well, maybe I can come over
to your house later.

845
01:08:42,385 --> 01:08:44,385
I'm so sorry.

846
01:08:44,387 --> 01:08:46,087
<i>I'm sorry too.</i>

847
01:08:46,089 --> 01:08:50,291
<i>Believe me, but I've just been
having the most vivid thoughts.</i>

848
01:08:50,293 --> 01:08:51,659
<i>I...</i>

849
01:08:53,596 --> 01:08:55,196
<i>Elliot?</i>

850
01:08:59,635 --> 01:09:01,302
<i>Elliot?</i>

851
01:09:03,439 --> 01:09:04,806
Redmon.

852
01:09:06,108 --> 01:09:07,709
Larry Redmon.

853
01:09:09,078 --> 01:09:10,945
The writer.

854
01:09:10,947 --> 01:09:12,881
It was his nightstand.

855
01:09:15,484 --> 01:09:19,287
Mrs. Watkins, okay, maybe I'll see you
later. Maybe I'll have a fix for this.

856
01:09:19,289 --> 01:09:20,622
I gotta go. Thanks.

857
01:09:20,624 --> 01:09:22,123
<i>Oh, you're welcome, Elliot.</i>

858
01:09:22,125 --> 01:09:24,025
I'll be there soon.

859
01:09:33,969 --> 01:09:36,437
He almost got us, man.

860
01:09:36,439 --> 01:09:38,773
Oh, fuck. I almost killed you
with a bat.

861
01:09:38,775 --> 01:09:40,608
Fuck, he's not gonna get us.

862
01:09:40,610 --> 01:09:42,844
He's not going to get us.
I'll figure this out.

863
01:09:42,846 --> 01:09:44,612
I'm sorry, but...

864
01:09:44,614 --> 01:09:47,115
I'm sorry. I can't call an ambulance,
'cause you're gonna say it.

865
01:09:47,117 --> 01:09:48,883
You will. You will,
'cause I messed you up.

866
01:10:21,717 --> 01:10:23,618
I'll be back as soon as I can.

867
01:10:25,487 --> 01:10:27,488
I'm taking this.

868
01:10:27,490 --> 01:10:30,225
You found her. Now I'm
gonna go talk to her.

869
01:10:31,994 --> 01:10:33,461
I love you.

870
01:10:34,363 --> 01:10:36,064
And don't touch him.

871
01:11:26,915 --> 01:11:29,550
Hello?

872
01:11:29,552 --> 01:11:31,319
Mrs. Redmon?

873
01:11:42,598 --> 01:11:44,399
Leave!

874
01:11:44,401 --> 01:11:46,267
Mrs. Redmon.

875
01:11:46,269 --> 01:11:47,635
I said leave.

876
01:11:47,637 --> 01:11:49,737
Are you deaf or just defective?

877
01:11:49,739 --> 01:11:52,974
Mrs. Redmon, did your husband write
for<i> the register</i> a long time ago?

878
01:11:52,976 --> 01:11:55,743
You're too young
to remember that.

879
01:11:55,745 --> 01:11:58,980
Mrs. Redmon,
you're still alive.

880
01:11:58,982 --> 01:12:01,749
I know your husband
killed a lot of people.

881
01:12:01,751 --> 01:12:03,718
But I don't think he was crazy.

882
01:12:09,291 --> 01:12:12,160
I need your help.
Whatever you remember.

883
01:12:12,162 --> 01:12:14,962
There's a train, gold coins.

884
01:12:14,964 --> 01:12:16,531
A hound.

885
01:12:17,333 --> 01:12:20,134
He came to Larry...

886
01:12:20,136 --> 01:12:22,103
With the hound.

887
01:12:22,105 --> 01:12:24,439
What Larry told me
gave me nightmares.

888
01:12:24,441 --> 01:12:25,873
I made him stop.

889
01:12:26,642 --> 01:12:27,975
I understand.

890
01:12:27,977 --> 01:12:31,779
But I need you to tell me
everything Larry said.

891
01:12:31,781 --> 01:12:33,014
Please.

892
01:12:34,616 --> 01:12:38,786
Larry was on a story of a
teenager who killed his family.

893
01:12:38,788 --> 01:12:41,122
Poked around like
a good nosy reporter

894
01:12:41,124 --> 01:12:43,791
and heard rumors.

895
01:12:43,793 --> 01:12:46,494
Whispers about an evil.

896
01:12:46,496 --> 01:12:50,064
Some kind of reaper
that drove the teenager mad.

897
01:12:51,166 --> 01:12:53,134
Larry had to go nosing around

898
01:12:53,136 --> 01:12:56,671
and writing it down,
and then it came to Larry too.

899
01:12:56,673 --> 01:12:58,339
<i>This nightmare,</i>

900
01:12:58,341 --> 01:13:01,909
<i>this name
we must not think or say.</i>

901
01:13:03,345 --> 01:13:07,148
<i>But just three days
after Larry got back from Iowa,</i>

902
01:13:07,150 --> 01:13:08,983
<i>I came home from work.</i>

903
01:13:08,985 --> 01:13:12,220
<i>October 20, 1969.</i>

904
01:13:12,222 --> 01:13:16,224
<i>The day my life went
turn, turn, turn.</i>

905
01:13:17,826 --> 01:13:19,727
Don't say it.
Don't think it.

906
01:13:19,729 --> 01:13:21,863
Don't say it.
Don't think it.

907
01:13:21,865 --> 01:13:23,998
Don't say it.
Don't think it.

908
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,167
Don't say it.
Don't think it.

909
01:13:26,169 --> 01:13:28,002
Don't say it.
Don't think it.

910
01:13:28,004 --> 01:13:30,338
- Don't say it.
- Don't think it.

911
01:13:30,340 --> 01:13:34,342
Don't say it. Don't think it.
Don't say it. Don't think it.

912
01:13:34,344 --> 01:13:35,777
Oh, my god!

913
01:13:37,012 --> 01:13:38,646
Don't say it.

914
01:13:42,017 --> 01:13:44,285
Larry, oh, my god.

915
01:13:50,058 --> 01:13:52,360
I was just doing my job.

916
01:13:52,362 --> 01:13:54,195
That's what I do.
I track down the story.

917
01:13:54,197 --> 01:13:56,364
That's what I was doing.

918
01:13:56,366 --> 01:13:57,532
Yeah.

919
01:13:57,534 --> 01:13:58,766
See...

920
01:14:00,035 --> 01:14:02,437
Once you know his name,

921
01:14:02,439 --> 01:14:04,539
you can't escape him.

922
01:14:04,541 --> 01:14:07,074
You see, he...
He gets in your head.

923
01:14:07,076 --> 01:14:09,243
And...

924
01:14:09,245 --> 01:14:11,412
He makes you do horrible things.

925
01:14:11,414 --> 01:14:13,448
Okay.
Okay, shh.

926
01:14:13,450 --> 01:14:16,417
Whoa. What horrible things?
What?

927
01:14:16,419 --> 01:14:18,719
Who makes you do this?
What are you talking about?

928
01:14:18,721 --> 01:14:20,588
Let's get you to bed,
okay, sweetheart?

929
01:14:20,590 --> 01:14:22,223
Listen. Listen.

930
01:14:22,225 --> 01:14:26,227
I didn't know if he was alive
or dead, and then the hound...

931
01:14:26,229 --> 01:14:28,062
That's how you know he's coming.

932
01:14:28,064 --> 01:14:30,398
When you see the hound
and you hear the coins,

933
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:33,067
that's when you know
he's close by.

934
01:14:33,069 --> 01:14:34,068
You understand?

935
01:14:34,070 --> 01:14:35,736
No, i...

936
01:14:35,738 --> 01:14:38,272
Larry, I don't know
what's happened,

937
01:14:38,274 --> 01:14:40,441
but I'm trying...
He listens for his name.

938
01:14:40,443 --> 01:14:42,109
Anyone could say it.

939
01:14:42,111 --> 01:14:44,245
It could be you
or it could be me.

940
01:14:44,247 --> 01:14:48,149
And it's just dumb luck,
like the flip of a coin.

941
01:14:48,151 --> 01:14:49,617
And...

942
01:14:49,619 --> 01:14:53,754
I heard the name,
and I told Janie the name.

943
01:14:53,756 --> 01:14:55,423
Don't think it?
Don't say it?

944
01:14:55,425 --> 01:14:57,959
What does this mean?
What did you write?

945
01:14:57,961 --> 01:14:59,927
I don't understand.

946
01:14:59,929 --> 01:15:02,597
He... he makes you
see things.

947
01:15:02,599 --> 01:15:04,232
Then he makes you do things.

948
01:15:06,134 --> 01:15:09,270
Who knows how many good people he's
made do horrible things like this.

949
01:15:09,272 --> 01:15:10,171
No! Oh!

950
01:15:10,173 --> 01:15:11,506
God, no, please!

951
01:15:11,508 --> 01:15:12,807
Please don't.

952
01:15:12,809 --> 01:15:14,408
Please put it down.

953
01:15:16,612 --> 01:15:20,047
You think it's me.
You think I did this?

954
01:15:22,184 --> 01:15:24,151
This is what happens.

955
01:15:24,153 --> 01:15:27,021
They say people snap.
They say people go crazy.

956
01:15:27,023 --> 01:15:30,191
No, it's him.
It's him that's doing it.

957
01:15:30,193 --> 01:15:33,461
Shh. Just put it...
Put it down. Okay?

958
01:15:33,463 --> 01:15:34,695
No.

959
01:15:35,697 --> 01:15:37,131
I love you.

960
01:15:37,133 --> 01:15:39,667
<i>But in the end,
Larry was a hero.</i>

961
01:15:39,669 --> 01:15:42,803
You tell people that.
Larry erased him.

962
01:15:42,805 --> 01:15:46,807
You see, he did away with everyone who'd
heard it before they could pass it on.

963
01:15:46,809 --> 01:15:48,476
But not you.

964
01:15:48,478 --> 01:15:50,545
You're here.

965
01:15:50,547 --> 01:15:52,813
How did you survive
all this time?

966
01:15:52,815 --> 01:15:54,148
Survive?
Yes.

967
01:15:54,150 --> 01:15:56,651
How did you beat it?

968
01:15:56,653 --> 01:15:59,387
I didn't beat it.
I never<i> knew</i> it.

969
01:15:59,389 --> 01:16:01,222
What?

970
01:16:01,224 --> 01:16:03,724
If my husband told me the name,
he'd have to kill me with the rest.

971
01:16:03,726 --> 01:16:05,660
My husband controlled himself.

972
01:16:05,662 --> 01:16:09,530
Your fucking husband wrote the name in
the nightstand you sold, and I read it.

973
01:16:09,532 --> 01:16:11,999
He typed it in a dead article,
and I read that too.

974
01:16:12,001 --> 01:16:13,167
Don't you say it.

975
01:16:13,169 --> 01:16:15,336
Your husband spared you
and he got me.

976
01:16:15,338 --> 01:16:17,071
He's in me now.
He's in my friends.

977
01:16:19,007 --> 01:16:20,741
- You want my help?
- Yes.

978
01:16:21,877 --> 01:16:23,210
Here.

979
01:16:23,212 --> 01:16:25,413
Kill all the ones you told first

980
01:16:25,415 --> 01:16:27,348
and then kill yourself.

981
01:16:27,350 --> 01:16:29,417
It's the only way.

982
01:16:37,559 --> 01:16:40,194
No. There has
to be another way.

983
01:16:40,196 --> 01:16:41,562
Don't say it.
Don't think it.

984
01:16:41,564 --> 01:16:42,930
It's a clue.

985
01:16:44,199 --> 01:16:45,533
Look.

986
01:16:45,535 --> 01:16:47,535
Oh, my god.
He's coming!

987
01:16:47,537 --> 01:16:49,937
What are you talking about?
You didn't bring him here?

988
01:16:49,939 --> 01:16:51,572
- Don't you see it?
- See what?

989
01:16:51,574 --> 01:16:53,541
The light.
Hear the name.

990
01:16:53,543 --> 01:16:55,176
He's in your head.

991
01:16:56,445 --> 01:16:58,879
He makes us see things,
hear things.

992
01:16:58,881 --> 01:17:01,582
Tricks to make us afraid.
He makes us afraid.

993
01:17:01,584 --> 01:17:04,785
And he grows. The more scared
we are, the more real he gets.

994
01:17:04,787 --> 01:17:08,055
We make him real with our fear.
We make him more powerful.

995
01:17:10,460 --> 01:17:14,562
Yeah, we give him the power, and he gets
closer, and he hears us when we think of him.

996
01:17:14,564 --> 01:17:16,964
But maybe if we're not afraid,
we take his power.

997
01:17:16,966 --> 01:17:19,767
Maybe if we're not afraid,
he's nothing!

998
01:17:26,074 --> 01:17:28,242
How could you figure it out
and my Larry not?

999
01:17:30,413 --> 01:17:31,512
Help me!

1000
01:17:32,981 --> 01:17:34,949
Help me!

1001
01:17:39,489 --> 01:17:40,955
Shoot me now!

1002
01:17:43,492 --> 01:17:45,326
Uh-uh, uh-uh.
No, no.

1003
01:17:45,328 --> 01:17:46,460
It's not real.

1004
01:17:48,263 --> 01:17:49,864
No, it's not real.

1005
01:17:50,432 --> 01:17:51,899
Help me!

1006
01:17:59,976 --> 01:18:02,510
I have you now, don't I?

1007
01:18:03,612 --> 01:18:05,279
Come on.
Try another trick.

1008
01:18:05,281 --> 01:18:06,881
Come on. Try it!

1009
01:18:08,483 --> 01:18:09,884
Where are you?

1010
01:18:10,986 --> 01:18:12,086
Where are you?

1011
01:18:14,956 --> 01:18:16,857
Oh, my god.

1012
01:18:16,859 --> 01:18:18,359
Sasha!

1013
01:18:25,635 --> 01:18:26,967
Pick up.

1014
01:18:26,969 --> 01:18:28,803
Sasha.

1015
01:18:28,805 --> 01:18:32,306
<i>Hey, this is Sasha. Leave...</i> you
better not fucking hurt her.

1016
01:18:32,308 --> 01:18:34,008
Sasha.

1017
01:18:34,010 --> 01:18:35,810
I'm coming.

1018
01:18:35,812 --> 01:18:38,145
I know it's hard,
but don't be afraid,

1019
01:18:38,147 --> 01:18:39,613
and don't believe
anything you see.

1020
01:18:50,892 --> 01:18:52,293
Whoa!

1021
01:18:55,063 --> 01:18:56,430
What?

1022
01:18:59,534 --> 01:19:01,068
No, you're not real.

1023
01:19:03,338 --> 01:19:04,772
You're not real.

1024
01:19:06,842 --> 01:19:08,409
Ha! I knew it!

1025
01:19:51,787 --> 01:19:53,888
Okay. Tricks.

1026
01:19:53,890 --> 01:19:55,489
You wanna play tricks.

1027
01:19:57,092 --> 01:19:59,326
Okay. I'm ready.

1028
01:20:47,776 --> 01:20:49,510
Elliot?

1029
01:20:49,512 --> 01:20:50,945
John?

1030
01:20:50,947 --> 01:20:52,213
Where are you guys?

1031
01:21:03,124 --> 01:21:04,358
Elliot!

1032
01:21:09,865 --> 01:21:11,098
Sasha!

1033
01:21:18,707 --> 01:21:19,874
Elliot!

1034
01:21:24,379 --> 01:21:26,714
Sasha!

1035
01:21:26,716 --> 01:21:28,215
I'm in here.

1036
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:33,921
Oh, god.

1037
01:21:41,496 --> 01:21:42,897
You look like hell.

1038
01:21:42,899 --> 01:21:44,431
Jesus.

1039
01:21:45,200 --> 01:21:46,600
There you are.

1040
01:21:51,506 --> 01:21:53,874
Elliot, thank god.

1041
01:21:53,876 --> 01:21:55,876
You're back.

1042
01:21:55,878 --> 01:21:57,311
I'm not...

1043
01:22:01,549 --> 01:22:03,350
Oh, my god.

1044
01:22:03,352 --> 01:22:04,919
Hey, what's the matter?

1045
01:22:09,524 --> 01:22:11,859
Elliot, what are you doing?

1046
01:22:11,861 --> 01:22:12,861
Oh, shit.

1047
01:22:14,596 --> 01:22:16,530
- Get away.
- Hey, come on.

1048
01:22:16,532 --> 01:22:18,565
It's all going to be okay.
We're going to be okay.

1049
01:22:18,567 --> 01:22:20,200
I feel better.

1050
01:22:20,202 --> 01:22:21,635
Get away!

1051
01:22:22,871 --> 01:22:24,471
Fuck.

1052
01:22:26,374 --> 01:22:28,442
Elliot. It's me.

1053
01:22:29,711 --> 01:22:31,545
What the hell?

1054
01:22:31,547 --> 01:22:33,714
I don't understand.
What are you doing?

1055
01:22:33,716 --> 01:22:35,215
Help!

1056
01:22:35,217 --> 01:22:36,717
Elliot, come on.

1057
01:22:36,719 --> 01:22:38,385
Come here, John.

1058
01:22:38,387 --> 01:22:39,920
Please, Elliot.

1059
01:22:39,922 --> 01:22:41,488
Help!

1060
01:22:45,393 --> 01:22:47,494
I don't understand. Please.

1061
01:22:48,964 --> 01:22:49,964
No.

1062
01:22:51,566 --> 01:22:53,233
- Come on.
- No!

1063
01:22:53,235 --> 01:22:54,635
Please.

1064
01:22:56,404 --> 01:22:59,340
Elliot, please stop!
Would you just stop?

1065
01:23:01,242 --> 01:23:02,776
Get away from me!

1066
01:23:02,778 --> 01:23:05,079
Get away from me!

1067
01:23:05,081 --> 01:23:06,081
Get away!

1068
01:23:21,763 --> 01:23:22,863
Guys!

1069
01:23:26,468 --> 01:23:28,802
Sasha! John! It's a trick!
It's not real!

1070
01:23:28,804 --> 01:23:30,337
Listen to me!

1071
01:23:33,642 --> 01:23:35,342
Sasha! John!
Get off of me!

1072
01:23:35,344 --> 01:23:37,411
Listen to me. It's not real!

1073
01:23:39,647 --> 01:23:40,848
No!

1074
01:23:41,616 --> 01:23:43,150
John, no!

1075
01:23:43,152 --> 01:23:44,451
Aaah! Elliot!

1076
01:23:44,453 --> 01:23:45,853
Shoot! Shoot!

1077
01:24:42,010 --> 01:24:43,410
Oh, god!

1078
01:24:43,412 --> 01:24:44,778
Oh!

1079
01:25:51,246 --> 01:25:53,981
Go ahead. Kill me.

1080
01:25:53,983 --> 01:25:55,215
You win.

1081
01:26:10,666 --> 01:26:13,667
No. You leave them alone.

1082
01:26:26,114 --> 01:26:27,781
Come on, guys.
It's freezing out here.

1083
01:26:27,783 --> 01:26:29,950
Hey, man!
Anybody home?

1084
01:26:29,952 --> 01:26:32,853
I've got Alice here. She's here
to cheer you up. Buddy.

1085
01:26:32,855 --> 01:26:34,054
- Elliot!
- No!

1086
01:26:43,132 --> 01:26:45,132
Hey, is anybody home?

1087
01:26:45,134 --> 01:26:49,136
- Guys, come on. We know you're in there!
- I hear something. Hello?

1088
01:26:49,138 --> 01:26:50,971
Open the door. We're turning
into popsicles out here.

1089
01:26:50,973 --> 01:26:52,306
Go away!

1090
01:26:52,308 --> 01:26:54,141
Elliot?

1091
01:26:54,143 --> 01:26:55,475
Go away!

1092
01:26:55,477 --> 01:26:57,878
No, no, no. We're not
going anywhere, Elliot.

1093
01:26:57,880 --> 01:26:59,346
Uncle, open up!

1094
01:26:59,348 --> 01:27:01,648
Get her out of here.
Both of you! You need to go!

1095
01:27:01,650 --> 01:27:03,650
Open the goddamn door,
or I'm callin' the police.

1096
01:27:03,652 --> 01:27:05,319
Good, do it!

1097
01:27:05,321 --> 01:27:07,154
Honey, why don't you
go wait in the truck?

1098
01:27:07,156 --> 01:27:09,156
No, daddy, I gotta pee.

1099
01:27:09,158 --> 01:27:10,857
Go to the truck, please.

1100
01:27:10,859 --> 01:27:12,192
Open the door, man. Come on.

1101
01:27:12,194 --> 01:27:14,328
- Go. Go.
- Elliot!

1102
01:27:14,330 --> 01:27:15,862
B-b-bye...

1103
01:27:21,836 --> 01:27:23,203
No!

1104
01:27:23,205 --> 01:27:25,172
Elliot, what the hell
is going on?

1105
01:27:25,174 --> 01:27:27,174
Virgil, please get her
out of here.

1106
01:27:27,176 --> 01:27:29,076
Uncle Elliot!

1107
01:27:33,681 --> 01:27:36,016
Okay, peanut. I need you
to listen to me, okay?

1108
01:27:36,018 --> 01:27:37,584
I need you to go to the truck.

1109
01:27:37,586 --> 01:27:39,386
No, daddy, I gotta go!

1110
01:27:39,388 --> 01:27:41,688
Go someplace close where I
can see ya, and be quick.

1111
01:27:41,690 --> 01:27:44,024
Outside? Nobody's going to see you, baby.
It's okay.

1112
01:27:44,026 --> 01:27:45,325
Go, go, go.

1113
01:27:48,863 --> 01:27:50,364
Elliot.

1114
01:27:50,366 --> 01:27:52,199
Elliot, what is
going on in there?

1115
01:27:52,201 --> 01:27:55,202
Don't think it. Don't say it.
Don't think it. Don't say it.

1116
01:27:55,204 --> 01:27:56,703
What are you saying?

1117
01:27:56,705 --> 01:27:58,939
What? I have to do this!
I'm not crazy!

1118
01:27:58,941 --> 01:28:00,874
- Let me help you.
- No, you can't.

1119
01:28:00,876 --> 01:28:03,110
But I can help you, if you go!

1120
01:28:03,112 --> 01:28:04,745
I'm not going to
let you catch it!

1121
01:28:04,747 --> 01:28:06,380
Bye...
Don't say it!

1122
01:28:06,382 --> 01:28:07,581
Don't think it!

1123
01:28:07,583 --> 01:28:09,549
Just go!
Don't say what?

1124
01:28:12,620 --> 01:28:14,388
- Fuck!
- Elliot!

1125
01:28:14,390 --> 01:28:16,790
Christ, what was that?
Elliot, what was that?

1126
01:28:28,469 --> 01:28:30,203
The bye bye man.
Bye bye...

1127
01:28:34,742 --> 01:28:36,610
Bye-bye, what?
What is that? Bye-bye?

1128
01:28:36,612 --> 01:28:38,378
What is it?
What are you saying?

1129
01:28:43,584 --> 01:28:44,651
Oh, fuck.

1130
01:29:03,004 --> 01:29:04,538
Bye-bye, what?

1131
01:29:07,108 --> 01:29:09,376
What is that?
Elliot, bye-bye? What?

1132
01:29:10,445 --> 01:29:11,878
I love you so much.

1133
01:29:15,616 --> 01:29:16,950
Elliot!

1134
01:29:37,338 --> 01:29:38,872
Alice?

1135
01:29:38,874 --> 01:29:40,540
Alice?

1136
01:29:40,542 --> 01:29:42,209
Alice?

1137
01:29:42,211 --> 01:29:43,343
Alice?

1138
01:29:43,345 --> 01:29:44,778
Where are you, baby?

1139
01:29:46,214 --> 01:29:47,581
Alice!

1140
01:29:49,817 --> 01:29:50,951
God.

1141
01:29:53,555 --> 01:29:54,688
Alice?

1142
01:29:54,690 --> 01:29:56,656
Alice?

1143
01:29:56,658 --> 01:29:57,791
Honey?

1144
01:29:59,560 --> 01:30:00,927
Alice?

1145
01:30:07,235 --> 01:30:08,969
Alice?

1146
01:30:11,372 --> 01:30:13,573
Alice!

1147
01:30:20,181 --> 01:30:22,516
What? Honey.

1148
01:30:22,518 --> 01:30:24,518
Come here.
I was cold!

1149
01:30:24,520 --> 01:30:26,953
I know, honey,
but you scared me so much.

1150
01:30:31,025 --> 01:30:33,126
Oh, no! Look!

1151
01:30:34,529 --> 01:30:36,229
Uncle Elliot!

1152
01:30:36,231 --> 01:30:38,665
No, it's okay. It's okay.

1153
01:30:40,868 --> 01:30:42,669
The fire can't hurt him anymore.

1154
01:30:51,280 --> 01:30:53,780
So this boy ran
a librarian over,

1155
01:30:53,782 --> 01:30:56,116
mutilated and murdered
her children,

1156
01:30:56,118 --> 01:30:58,585
and then killed his
roommates and himself,

1157
01:30:58,587 --> 01:31:01,321
and you had him in custody
today, but you let him go?

1158
01:31:02,056 --> 01:31:03,623
Yes.

1159
01:31:03,625 --> 01:31:06,893
But this is not some creepy kid
pulling a columbine, okay?

1160
01:31:06,895 --> 01:31:08,261
I talked to him.

1161
01:31:08,263 --> 01:31:10,664
Something is going on here.
I can feel it.

1162
01:31:36,123 --> 01:31:38,191
I wanted to say good-bye.

1163
01:31:41,996 --> 01:31:43,597
I know, baby.

1164
01:31:43,599 --> 01:31:44,698
Me too.

1165
01:31:47,835 --> 01:31:50,537
At least he gave me the coins.

1166
01:31:52,273 --> 01:31:54,107
What are you talking about?

1167
01:31:54,109 --> 01:31:57,210
He must've left them out there
for me to find.

1168
01:31:59,313 --> 01:32:00,914
Left them out where, honey?

1169
01:32:02,483 --> 01:32:04,985
In the little table.

1170
01:32:04,987 --> 01:32:07,754
Outside next to the trash cans.

1171
01:32:10,958 --> 01:32:13,226
Was there anything else
in this table?

1172
01:32:14,529 --> 01:32:16,463
No.

1173
01:32:16,465 --> 01:32:18,164
Just some writing.

1174
01:32:18,166 --> 01:32:20,133
Writing?

1175
01:32:20,135 --> 01:32:21,902
What did this writing say?

1176
01:32:23,504 --> 01:32:26,373
Daddy.

1177
01:32:26,375 --> 01:32:29,309
You know I can't read
in the dark.

1178
01:32:29,311 --> 01:32:31,978
What do you think I am,
a flashlight?

1179
01:32:55,503 --> 01:32:57,003
We got one alive!

1180
01:32:57,005 --> 01:32:58,738
Get me a line and morphine!

1181
01:32:58,740 --> 01:33:00,507
Wait, wait!
He's trying to say something!

1182
01:33:00,509 --> 01:33:02,842
Hey, I'm listening. Go ahead.

1183
01:33:02,844 --> 01:33:04,010
It won't matter.

1184
01:33:04,012 --> 01:33:05,579
It does matter.

1185
01:33:05,581 --> 01:33:07,581
Okay, take your time.

1186
01:33:09,016 --> 01:33:10,417
It's okay, I'm here.

1187
01:33:10,419 --> 01:33:14,354
And I want to know, please.

1188
01:33:14,356 --> 01:33:15,922
Please tell me.

1189
01:33:17,358 --> 01:33:19,125
Bye bye...
