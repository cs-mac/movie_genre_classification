1
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:47,856
Hello, admitting.

2
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:51,301
This is Saperstein. Where is he?

3
00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:55,068
He's cleared admitting?

4
00:02:55,141 --> 00:02:58,440
Right. Bring him in.

5
00:03:08,154 --> 00:03:09,815
He's coming.

6
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:11,584
Good, good.

7
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,960
Trent?

8
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:23,662
John J.

9
00:03:23,736 --> 00:03:25,897
Put him in number nine.

10
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:31,908
You son of a bitch!

11
00:03:35,515 --> 00:03:37,039
Hang on to him.

12
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,657
Get him in there!

13
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:50,855
No, not me!

14
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:52,830
No, wait, wait!

15
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:54,196
This is wrong.

16
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:57,395
Look, I'm sorry about the balls!

17
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:59,938
It was a lucky shot, that's all!

18
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:01,871
Wait!

19
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:16,888
I'm not insane.

20
00:04:16,956 --> 00:04:18,116
You hear me?

21
00:04:18,191 --> 00:04:20,421
I'm not insane!

22
00:04:20,493 --> 00:04:22,757
I'm not if he's not!

23
00:04:24,631 --> 00:04:27,361
Me neither!

24
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:32,996
I'm not insane!

25
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:21,216
We've only just begun

26
00:05:21,287 --> 00:05:24,347
Not the Carpenters, too.

27
00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:31,252
So let me go

28
00:06:12,805 --> 00:06:16,673
This is a rotten way to end it.

29
00:06:16,743 --> 00:06:18,176
This is not the ending.

30
00:06:18,244 --> 00:06:19,677
You haven't read it yet.

31
00:06:48,674 --> 00:06:49,868
All right.

32
00:06:49,942 --> 00:06:51,307
Came in this afternoon?

33
00:06:51,377 --> 00:06:54,244
Yes. How did you
get here so fast?

34
00:06:54,313 --> 00:06:55,871
We've been monitoring
all admissions..

35
00:06:55,948 --> 00:06:57,279
through police and
paramedic channels.

36
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:58,442
This one fit the symptoms.

37
00:06:58,518 --> 00:07:02,318
Do you think he's one of them?

38
00:07:02,388 --> 00:07:03,878
Mr. Saperstein, I promise you..

39
00:07:03,956 --> 00:07:05,617
that's what I'm
here to find out.

40
00:07:05,691 --> 00:07:08,182
Things must be getting
pretty bad out there..

41
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:09,922
to bring youfellas in.

42
00:07:10,963 --> 00:07:12,157
Is this it?

43
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:15,992
Did he make any requests?

44
00:07:16,068 --> 00:07:18,229
Just..

45
00:07:18,304 --> 00:07:19,601
one.

46
00:07:19,672 --> 00:07:20,764
A, uh..

47
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,775
single black crayon.

48
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:47,997
Hang on.

49
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:54,932
What's up?

50
00:07:55,007 --> 00:07:58,067
My name is Dr. Wrenn..

51
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:00,112
and I am going to try and
get you out of here.

52
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:05,011
After all my redecorating?

53
00:08:05,084 --> 00:08:07,382
No. I think I'll stay.

54
00:08:07,453 --> 00:08:10,081
There's a guard with a pair
of swollen testicles..

55
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:12,386
who swears you
wanted out of here.

56
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:16,127
I, uh, well..

57
00:08:16,195 --> 00:08:18,390
I've changed my mind.

58
00:08:18,464 --> 00:08:20,762
I see.

59
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:23,927
The crosses are a nice touch.

60
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:26,995
They'd almost have to
keep you in here..

61
00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:30,702
once they'd seen these,
wouldn't they, John?

62
00:08:30,776 --> 00:08:32,334
Got a smoke?

63
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:49,426
You're waiting to hear about
my "them," aren't you?

64
00:08:49,495 --> 00:08:50,826
Your what?

65
00:08:52,331 --> 00:08:54,026
My "them."

66
00:08:55,167 --> 00:08:57,226
Every paranoid
schizophrenic has one..

67
00:08:57,303 --> 00:09:00,295
a "them," a "they," an "it."

68
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:04,070
And you want to hear about
my "them," don't you?

69
00:09:04,143 --> 00:09:06,111
I want to know how you got here.

70
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:13,477
Things are turning to shit
out there, aren't they?

71
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:17,314
Let's talk about you.

72
00:09:20,092 --> 00:09:21,821
Your dime.

73
00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:25,722
I'm, uh..

74
00:09:25,798 --> 00:09:30,292
I was an insurance
investigator, freelance.

75
00:09:31,871 --> 00:09:33,862
Checked outfunny
claims, frauds..

76
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,908
the usual kind of thing.

77
00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:40,036
And lately I'd been working
for a firm here in the city.

78
00:09:40,112 --> 00:09:46,950
And all of this started
with the disappearance.

79
00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:50,248
The Sutter Cane..

80
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:51,847
disappearance.

81
00:09:58,164 --> 00:10:00,758
It's a little hot
in here, isn't it?

82
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:02,130
It's boiling.

83
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:05,598
How long I gotta be here?

84
00:10:05,671 --> 00:10:07,639
I mean, uh..

85
00:10:07,707 --> 00:10:09,971
I took care of all
that paperwork.

86
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:12,033
The check was supposed to
be here three weeks ago.

87
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:14,671
Right? Isn't that right?

88
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:16,715
Well, usually, yeah,
that's the way it goes..

89
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:20,343
but I just have a few final
questions about the fire.

90
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:21,511
More questions.

91
00:10:21,587 --> 00:10:23,111
I've answered all
your questions.

92
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:24,281
Enough's enough.

93
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:27,121
It was supposed to
be cut and dried.

94
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:29,058
We'll be out of
here in a minute.

95
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:31,688
See, Robby here, he
owns the company.

96
00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:34,824
And he's hired me to see that
things go smoothly, understand?

97
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,733
It's just a little
thing, but, see..

98
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:39,771
Robby takes the view
that it was you..

99
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,967
who burned down your own
warehouse on Northern Boulevard.

100
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:44,873
Me? That's horseshit.

101
00:10:44,944 --> 00:10:46,343
That was all my own stuff
in that warehouse.

102
00:10:46,412 --> 00:10:47,504
That's my whole life.

103
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:50,413
Believe me, I sympathize.

104
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:52,178
You're really starting to sweat.

105
00:10:52,251 --> 00:10:54,344
Shall I turn on the
air conditioning?

106
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,853
Oh, no, I'm fine.

107
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:57,354
- You sure?
- Yeah.

108
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,717
I'm running a little late.

109
00:11:00,793 --> 00:11:02,920
Supposed to pick up my wife.

110
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:05,190
Oh, yeah, your wife.

111
00:11:05,264 --> 00:11:07,027
She's a great lady.

112
00:11:08,267 --> 00:11:10,064
You know her?

113
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:12,001
No, not really. We
just met briefly.

114
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:16,201
You know, when I went round
to check up on your story.

115
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:17,503
We have these photographs..

116
00:11:17,576 --> 00:11:21,512
of your wife tooling
around town..

117
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:22,842
wearing various articles..

118
00:11:22,915 --> 00:11:25,816
that you claim were
destroyed in the fire.

119
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:29,013
No, that's impossible.

120
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:34,960
No, this is all stuff I
boughtfor her myseif.

121
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:36,654
See, the problem is..

122
00:11:36,729 --> 00:11:39,129
when I went round
to talk to her..

123
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:42,429
it turned out she knew much
more than she thought she did.

124
00:11:42,501 --> 00:11:44,059
Especially..

125
00:11:44,136 --> 00:11:49,369
Especially after I showed her
pictures of Miss Palminteri..

126
00:11:49,442 --> 00:11:50,966
who appears to be wearing..

127
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:52,874
even more of your
destroyed articles.

128
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:57,038
Miss Palminteri?

129
00:11:58,451 --> 00:12:01,011
Miss Rosa Palminteri.

130
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:04,189
A word of advice.

131
00:12:04,256 --> 00:12:09,353
You want to pull a scam, don't
make your wife a partner.

132
00:12:09,428 --> 00:12:11,453
If you do..

133
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:14,522
don'tfuck around
behind her back.

134
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,704
Trent, beautiful.

135
00:12:18,771 --> 00:12:22,832
Everybody says you got the best
nose for a con in the business.

136
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:25,968
But to see itfirsthand, I
mean, to watch you work..

137
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:27,342
is incredible.

138
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:28,675
Well, it wasn't hard, Robby.

139
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:31,444
The guy's wife liked me.

140
00:12:31,517 --> 00:12:33,246
Besides, he was an amateur.

141
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:34,718
It's too easy with amateurs.

142
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:37,950
You try to figure out who's
professional and who isn't.

143
00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:41,925
That's when it gets fun,
when you run into a pro.

144
00:12:41,994 --> 00:12:44,554
You know, most of my salesmen..

145
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:46,598
couldn't sniff out
a phony claim..

146
00:12:46,665 --> 00:12:49,099
if their noses were
nailed to it, but you..

147
00:12:49,168 --> 00:12:51,102
man, you never miss.

148
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:52,330
What's to miss?

149
00:12:52,404 --> 00:12:54,872
You learn to expect the worst
in people, and you get it.

150
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,909
Everyone's looking
to play an angle.

151
00:12:57,977 --> 00:13:00,571
I'm always there to
clean up the mess.

152
00:13:00,646 --> 00:13:01,874
I'll tell you what.

153
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:04,814
You stop freelancing,
join my staff.

154
00:13:04,884 --> 00:13:06,715
I'll make it worth your while.

155
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,777
Forget it, Robby.

156
00:13:08,854 --> 00:13:11,288
I'm my own man. Nobody
pulls my strings.

157
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:12,654
I'm independent, I'm happy.

158
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:15,250
Well, be my man one more time.

159
00:13:15,327 --> 00:13:18,125
I'm having quite a difficult
mess with Arcane.

160
00:13:18,197 --> 00:13:19,323
The publishing house?

161
00:13:19,398 --> 00:13:21,161
Yeah, my biggest account.

162
00:13:21,233 --> 00:13:25,397
They justfiled a claim
that cost me millions.

163
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:27,371
I want you on this right away.

164
00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:28,497
What's the claim?

165
00:13:28,574 --> 00:13:30,041
Sutter Cane is missing.

166
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:31,337
Who?

167
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:32,638
Sutter Cane.

168
00:13:52,765 --> 00:13:54,892
Do you read Sutter Cane?

169
00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:56,332
What?

170
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:19,917
Horror writer Sutter Cane..

171
00:14:19,992 --> 00:14:22,927
a harmless pop phenomenon..

172
00:14:22,995 --> 00:14:25,896
or a deadly mad prophet
of the printed page?

173
00:14:25,965 --> 00:14:29,526
This was the scene today outside
several city bookstores.

174
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:30,899
Police believe the riots began..

175
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:33,438
because the stores could
not meet the demand..

176
00:14:33,505 --> 00:14:36,997
for advance orders of Sutter
Cane's latest novel..

177
00:14:37,076 --> 00:14:38,839
'In the Mouth of Madness."

178
00:14:38,911 --> 00:14:41,436
When does fiction
become religion?

179
00:14:41,513 --> 00:14:43,242
And are his fans dangerous?

180
00:14:43,315 --> 00:14:45,442
Only if you count axes.

181
00:14:45,517 --> 00:14:49,009
In related news, there were
eighteen other stores..

182
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:05,500
Mr. Harglow will see you now.

183
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:06,697
Thank you.

184
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:10,667
You're not listening to me.
I needed it yesterday.

185
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:12,836
If you wait any longer, it'll
be all over the front page.

186
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,004
Get it done!

187
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:18,106
Jackson Harglow, Mr. Trent.
I'm pleased to meet you.

188
00:15:18,183 --> 00:15:19,411
It's a pleasure.

189
00:15:19,485 --> 00:15:20,577
Excuse the commotion.

190
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:24,020
We have something of
a crisis going on.

191
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:25,681
Everybody out now, please.

192
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:27,589
I need time with Mr. Trent.

193
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,958
Have Sylvia hold the calls,
and you get Linda in here.

194
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:33,726
That was great. I
almost left myseif.

195
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:35,494
Sit down, please.

196
00:15:35,567 --> 00:15:38,661
I am a little short on
patience these days.

197
00:15:38,737 --> 00:15:43,333
So, Mr. Trent, are
youfamiliar with Arcane?

198
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:44,569
Well, aside from the fact..

199
00:15:44,643 --> 00:15:46,702
that you're insured by
the company I work for..

200
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,337
I never heard of Arcane.
I'm sorry.

201
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:49,881
You read books?

202
00:15:54,086 --> 00:15:57,112
Linda Styles, John Trent.

203
00:15:57,189 --> 00:16:00,386
Linda reads books for a living.
She's one of our best editors.

204
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:01,551
Since she joined the firm..

205
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:04,391
she's been handling
Sutter Cane exclusively.

206
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:08,058
Isn't he the guy that
writes that horror crap?

207
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:09,930
Maybe he's too
sophisticated for you.

208
00:16:10,002 --> 00:16:11,401
Sutter Cane happens to be..

209
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,665
this century's most
widely read author.

210
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:15,673
You can forget about
Stephen King.

211
00:16:15,741 --> 00:16:17,538
Cane outsells them all.

212
00:16:17,609 --> 00:16:20,737
So what happened to
this cash cow of yours?

213
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:23,646
Cane disappeared two months
ago without a trace.

214
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:27,243
The police have
turned up nothing.

215
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:30,015
Who was the last person
to hearfrom him?

216
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:31,181
His agent.

217
00:16:31,256 --> 00:16:32,848
Cane mailed him
several chapters..

218
00:16:32,925 --> 00:16:35,052
of his new book, oh,
not two weeks ago.

219
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:38,858
Plain brown wrapper.
No return address.

220
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:44,897
Oh, gee, I'm sorry. You
don't mind, do you?

221
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:53,644
What'd the agent have to say?

222
00:16:53,712 --> 00:16:56,340
You heard what he had to say.

223
00:16:56,415 --> 00:16:58,349
What are you talking about?

224
00:16:58,417 --> 00:17:00,385
I understand you were there..

225
00:17:00,452 --> 00:17:03,785
when the poor man went crazy
in midtown Manhattan.

226
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:06,222
You witnessed the
shooting, I believe.

227
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:08,521
That lunatic with the ax?
That was Cane's agent?

228
00:17:09,828 --> 00:17:11,625
Hard to believe, isn't it?

229
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:15,929
Yeah, well, you'd think a guy
that outsells Stephen King..

230
00:17:16,001 --> 00:17:17,662
couldfind better representation.

231
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:21,396
Excuse me.

232
00:17:34,153 --> 00:17:35,984
It's just a little joke.

233
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,250
Well, we're not in the mood.

234
00:17:38,323 --> 00:17:39,756
I'll see you out, Mr. Trent.

235
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:40,917
Thank you.

236
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:42,790
Cane is a billion-dollar
franchise.

237
00:17:42,861 --> 00:17:44,453
He's the tent pole
to this company.

238
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:46,930
We've already sold the film
rights to his new book..

239
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:49,991
as well as publication rights
in eighteen languages..

240
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,696
The book you can'tfind?

241
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:54,466
Well, his agentfound it,
at least part of it.

242
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:57,134
You think he took one look
at this latest work of art..

243
00:17:57,209 --> 00:17:59,439
and went ax-happy
in broad daylight?

244
00:17:59,511 --> 00:18:00,478
I think it's great.

245
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:02,979
It's great promotion for
Arcane, great publicity.

246
00:18:03,015 --> 00:18:04,949
This was not a publicity stunt.

247
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:06,177
You were there.

248
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:08,776
Cane's writing has been
known to have an effect..

249
00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:10,446
on his less stable readers.

250
00:18:10,522 --> 00:18:11,784
An effect? Like what?

251
00:18:11,857 --> 00:18:14,485
Well, disorientation,
memory loss..

252
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,720
severe paranoid reaction.

253
00:18:15,794 --> 00:18:18,354
People pay money to feel like that?
It's cute.

254
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:20,364
Put it in the press kit.

255
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:22,696
We need you.

256
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:26,329
OK. Well, why don't you and
I get together after work?

257
00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:28,202
We'll go through his files.

258
00:18:29,374 --> 00:18:30,671
I don't think so.

259
00:18:30,742 --> 00:18:33,643
I need to see his contracts,
papers, you know.

260
00:18:33,712 --> 00:18:36,044
Impossible. His agent
was a total buffer.

261
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:38,913
We don't even know
where Cane lives.

262
00:18:38,984 --> 00:18:41,077
What do you know?

263
00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:42,814
For about a year before
he disappeared..

264
00:18:42,888 --> 00:18:46,688
his work became erratic, bent,
more bizarre than usual.

265
00:18:46,758 --> 00:18:49,659
He became convinced his
writing was real, notfiction.

266
00:18:49,728 --> 00:18:51,719
Then the work stopped coming.

267
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:54,095
I need to know if
he's alive or dead.

268
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:55,258
And I need that book.

269
00:18:55,334 --> 00:18:57,427
We've delayed publication
as long as we can.

270
00:18:57,503 --> 00:18:59,698
His fans are getting
really restless.

271
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:02,470
This shit really
sells, doesn't it?

272
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:04,532
More than you'd imagine.
Surprised?

273
00:19:05,677 --> 00:19:08,111
Lady, nothing surprises me.

274
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:11,172
We fucked up the air, the
water, we fucked up each other.

275
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,774
Why don't we finish the job..

276
00:19:12,851 --> 00:19:15,445
by justflushing our
brains down the toilet?

277
00:19:15,521 --> 00:19:18,285
Why don't you try
reading his stuff?

278
00:19:18,357 --> 00:19:20,257
See if you can get it.

279
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:21,622
Got any on tape?

280
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:04,693
You want some, too, buddy?

281
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:06,260
No, relax, Robby.

282
00:20:06,338 --> 00:20:09,307
Look, it's a scam, of
course it's a scam.

283
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:10,773
You see..

284
00:20:10,842 --> 00:20:13,037
all this strange behaviorfrom
people that read the books..

285
00:20:13,111 --> 00:20:15,671
and the agent going
nuts and so on..

286
00:20:15,747 --> 00:20:19,046
I figure it's like mass
hysteria, you know?

287
00:20:19,117 --> 00:20:21,984
It's like, um, it's
a pop phenomenon.

288
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:23,521
It's a craze. It'll pass.

289
00:20:23,589 --> 00:20:27,286
It's this year's Hula-Hoop.
Something like that.

290
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:30,795
Yeah, my God, it's freaky.

291
00:20:30,862 --> 00:20:32,830
No, it's a setup.

292
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:35,230
I just have to work
out how it's set up.

293
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,461
It's just a matter of time.

294
00:20:37,536 --> 00:20:38,696
You, too?

295
00:20:40,305 --> 00:20:42,432
God, I've had heartburn,
tell me about it.

296
00:20:42,507 --> 00:20:46,238
Sporadic riots continue
to hit Eastern cities..

297
00:20:46,311 --> 00:20:49,144
and reports of violence from
Boston and Philadelphia..

298
00:20:49,214 --> 00:20:50,977
are now coming in.

299
00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:54,712
Police continue to describe
barely coherent witnesses..

300
00:20:54,786 --> 00:20:55,980
all reporting having read..

301
00:20:56,054 --> 00:20:58,784
horror novelist Sutter
Cane's latest novel..

302
00:20:58,857 --> 00:21:00,552
'Hobb's End Horror."

303
00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:02,854
Many officers have been
physically attacked..

304
00:21:02,894 --> 00:21:05,795
and more than three
hundred eighty people..

305
00:21:05,864 --> 00:21:09,027
male andfemale, have been
jailed in New York County.

306
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:11,501
Two officers in Boston
were hacked to death..

307
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:15,301
amid jeering crowds in
an attack last night.

308
00:21:17,142 --> 00:21:20,270
What is this horrible,
unexplainable madness..

309
00:21:20,345 --> 00:21:22,142
that is gripping our lives?

310
00:21:22,214 --> 00:21:23,806
What in the world is happening?

311
00:21:23,882 --> 00:21:25,281
I can see.

312
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:27,614
Now we have an editorial..

313
00:21:27,686 --> 00:21:29,153
Excuse me?

314
00:21:29,221 --> 00:21:31,849
He sees you.

315
00:21:33,725 --> 00:21:35,056
Great. Uh..

316
00:21:36,561 --> 00:21:37,823
Tell him I say hi.

317
00:21:49,374 --> 00:21:52,275
Oh, hi, Robby. Yeah.
Yeah, not a lot.

318
00:21:52,344 --> 00:21:54,812
I picked up some of these
Sutter Cane books.

319
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,279
I've been reading them.

320
00:21:56,348 --> 00:21:57,542
Well, it..

321
00:21:57,616 --> 00:21:59,811
Pulp horror novels. They're
all pretty familiar.

322
00:21:59,885 --> 00:22:01,648
They all seem to
have the same plot.

323
00:22:01,753 --> 00:22:03,550
Slimy things in the
dark, people go mad..

324
00:22:03,588 --> 00:22:04,987
they turn into monsters.

325
00:22:05,057 --> 00:22:07,992
The funny thing is that they're
kind of better written..

326
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:09,391
than you'd expect.

327
00:22:09,461 --> 00:22:10,928
They sort of get
to you in a way.

328
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:12,896
I don't know if it's
his style of writing..

329
00:22:12,964 --> 00:22:15,558
or his use of description
or whatever, but..

330
00:22:17,536 --> 00:22:19,231
No, don't be silly.

331
00:23:41,219 --> 00:23:43,483
Do you want some, too, buddy?

332
00:23:46,958 --> 00:23:49,085
He sees you.

333
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,360
What?

334
00:24:18,323 --> 00:24:20,086
Aw, it's just too weird.

335
00:24:57,362 --> 00:24:59,296
Beautiful.

336
00:25:04,402 --> 00:25:05,835
Where'd you go?

337
00:25:09,641 --> 00:25:11,506
Assuming you went somewhere.

338
00:26:30,555 --> 00:26:32,352
Cute.

339
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:36,190
Now I know why Cane had
the artwork done himseif.

340
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:39,025
See this? It's a map.

341
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:40,860
The red dot is Hobb's End.

342
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:42,559
It's not on any real
map, but look at this.

343
00:26:42,634 --> 00:26:45,330
The two line up.

344
00:26:45,403 --> 00:26:46,665
Like it or not..

345
00:26:46,738 --> 00:26:49,263
Cane's book covers
place Hobb's End..

346
00:26:49,341 --> 00:26:51,036
right in the middle
of New England.

347
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:53,703
So you're saying the man
went someplace fictional?

348
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:56,804
It's a real place
in a real state.

349
00:26:56,881 --> 00:26:58,178
New Hampshire, to be precise.

350
00:26:58,249 --> 00:26:59,773
But it's not on the map.

351
00:26:59,851 --> 00:27:03,309
Well, not on any new ones,
but maybe on some old ones.

352
00:27:03,421 --> 00:27:07,187
There's plenty of forgotten
towns across America.

353
00:27:07,225 --> 00:27:09,159
Makes a great
contest, doesn't it?

354
00:27:09,227 --> 00:27:10,751
Put the pieces together,
find the town..

355
00:27:10,829 --> 00:27:12,922
win a Sutter Cane lunchbox.

356
00:27:12,998 --> 00:27:16,263
How can you be sure he's there?

357
00:27:17,602 --> 00:27:20,036
Well, I'd have to go to be sure.

358
00:27:20,105 --> 00:27:22,471
You sure you want me to go?

359
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:24,599
I'm not suggesting
that you're lying..

360
00:27:24,676 --> 00:27:26,644
that you're about to file
a fraudulent claim..

361
00:27:26,711 --> 00:27:28,872
butforgive me if this sounds..

362
00:27:28,947 --> 00:27:31,415
a little bit like
bullshit to me.

363
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:32,882
And if you're
telling the truth..

364
00:27:32,951 --> 00:27:34,441
if you really want
your author back..

365
00:27:34,519 --> 00:27:36,419
if you really want your book..

366
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:38,615
then maybe it's in both
our best interests..

367
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:40,658
if I go find him.

368
00:27:40,725 --> 00:27:43,785
We have nothing to
hide, Mr. Trent.

369
00:27:43,862 --> 00:27:46,490
I desire only ourfair
share if Cane is dead..

370
00:27:46,564 --> 00:27:49,055
or our property if he's alive.

371
00:27:49,134 --> 00:27:51,625
Since I assume you also
have nothing to hide..

372
00:27:51,703 --> 00:27:54,968
I'm sure you won't mind if
I send Miss Styles along..

373
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,530
on your expedition.

374
00:28:00,078 --> 00:28:02,046
Well, it's your party.

375
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:08,710
America, the

376
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:17,255
Beautiful

377
00:28:20,265 --> 00:28:22,563
From sea to

378
00:28:24,736 --> 00:28:27,204
Shining

379
00:28:35,413 --> 00:28:37,608
Who is it? What?

380
00:28:37,682 --> 00:28:39,707
You're awake.

381
00:28:43,588 --> 00:28:45,818
Couldn't you just shake
me, you asshole?

382
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:47,517
What did I do?

383
00:28:50,328 --> 00:28:51,955
We're lost.

384
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:57,434
We are lost because there is
no such place as Hobb's End.

385
00:28:57,502 --> 00:28:58,662
Well, we'll see.

386
00:29:00,038 --> 00:29:02,336
Never, never, never..

387
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:04,034
throw chips at a driver.

388
00:29:06,644 --> 00:29:08,737
God damn it. Shit.

389
00:29:08,813 --> 00:29:09,939
Asshole.

390
00:29:16,387 --> 00:29:18,617
Styles, can I ask you something?

391
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:22,456
Do you really like
working on Cane's stuff?

392
00:29:22,527 --> 00:29:24,927
Do you really like
busting people?

393
00:29:24,996 --> 00:29:27,521
Yeah. I bustfrauds,
I bust phonies..

394
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:28,861
and, yeah, I love it.

395
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:31,458
Have you ever busted
anyone you know?

396
00:29:31,536 --> 00:29:33,231
Yeah, sure I did.

397
00:29:33,304 --> 00:29:34,601
Didn't make any difference.

398
00:29:34,672 --> 00:29:37,607
You see, in my business,
you soon find out..

399
00:29:37,675 --> 00:29:39,643
that anybody's
capable of anything.

400
00:29:39,711 --> 00:29:42,373
If you can think of
it, they've done it.

401
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:44,381
Doesn't leave you
much to believe in.

402
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:45,916
Yeah. But think of the upside..

403
00:29:45,984 --> 00:29:48,452
it doesn't leave you much to
be disappointed in, either.

404
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:51,683
Believe me, the sooner we're
off the planet, the better.

405
00:29:51,756 --> 00:29:54,554
Now you sound like Cane.

406
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:56,457
No, not me.

407
00:29:56,528 --> 00:29:58,792
You're the Cane lover.

408
00:29:58,863 --> 00:30:01,024
I just like being scared.

409
00:30:01,099 --> 00:30:02,726
Cane's work scares me.

410
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:04,063
What's to be scared about?

411
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:06,000
It's not like it's
real or anything.

412
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:07,503
It's not real from
your point of view..

413
00:30:07,572 --> 00:30:09,597
and right now reality
shares your point of view.

414
00:30:09,674 --> 00:30:12,006
What scares me about
Cane's work..

415
00:30:12,076 --> 00:30:14,442
is what might happen if reality
shared his point of view.

416
00:30:14,512 --> 00:30:16,878
Whoa. We're not talking
about reality here.

417
00:30:16,948 --> 00:30:19,246
We're talking aboutfiction.
It's different, you know.

418
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:22,684
A reality is just what we
tell each other it is.

419
00:30:22,754 --> 00:30:25,154
Sane and insane could
easily switch places..

420
00:30:25,223 --> 00:30:27,748
if the insane were to
become the majority.

421
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:30,693
You wouldfind yourseif
locked in a padded cell..

422
00:30:30,762 --> 00:30:34,493
wondering what
happened to the world.

423
00:30:34,566 --> 00:30:36,796
No, that wouldn't happen to me.

424
00:30:36,868 --> 00:30:38,836
It would if you realized..

425
00:30:38,903 --> 00:30:41,804
everything you ever
knew was gone.

426
00:30:41,873 --> 00:30:45,934
It'd be pretty lonely
being the last one left.

427
00:30:50,615 --> 00:30:52,207
Not only in Manhattan proper..

428
00:30:52,283 --> 00:30:54,808
but there was that
incident in Long Island..

429
00:30:54,886 --> 00:30:56,114
that was also related to it.

430
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:59,350
Come on, I don't buy this. I
mean, what are you saying?

431
00:30:59,424 --> 00:31:00,413
That there's some
kind of disease..

432
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:01,856
that's spreading
across the country?

433
00:31:01,893 --> 00:31:04,760
It is an addiction that
people have at this time..

434
00:31:04,829 --> 00:31:08,060
fantasy-creating out of
the written material.

435
00:31:08,132 --> 00:31:10,032
How could it be addicting?

436
00:31:10,101 --> 00:31:12,296
Look, I mean this is words.

437
00:31:23,748 --> 00:31:26,581
Or just something that
is created by the press?

438
00:31:26,651 --> 00:31:30,314
No. I think it's acting
stupid is what it is.

439
00:31:58,449 --> 00:31:59,609
Jesus Christ.

440
00:32:00,852 --> 00:32:02,945
I saw a..

441
00:32:03,021 --> 00:32:06,047
A cow, a sheep, a pig?
What'd you see?

442
00:32:06,124 --> 00:32:08,615
Never mind. It was nothing.

443
00:32:08,693 --> 00:32:09,819
Good.

444
00:32:39,524 --> 00:32:40,889
Don't move him!

445
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:42,051
Is he alive?

446
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:43,525
I don't know.

447
00:32:43,594 --> 00:32:44,993
Just don't move.

448
00:32:45,063 --> 00:32:46,690
He'll get a blanket,
so lie still.

449
00:32:46,764 --> 00:32:48,322
I can't get out.

450
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:49,491
Don't move.

451
00:32:49,567 --> 00:32:52,058
They won't let me out.

452
00:33:16,961 --> 00:33:18,326
He was OK?

453
00:33:23,634 --> 00:33:26,125
Come on, let's go.

454
00:33:26,204 --> 00:33:29,640
We'll tell the cops when
we hit the next town.

455
00:33:29,707 --> 00:33:30,867
You OK?

456
00:35:10,374 --> 00:35:12,035
Oh, I can't believe it.

457
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:15,011
I must have slept through
the whole night.

458
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:16,671
Hey, thanks for driving.

459
00:35:19,517 --> 00:35:20,916
What is it?

460
00:35:20,985 --> 00:35:22,213
Look.

461
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:27,785
Styles, you're fantastic.
Youfound it.

462
00:35:30,728 --> 00:35:31,888
What's wrong?

463
00:35:33,764 --> 00:35:35,026
You drive.

464
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:23,973
Cute, cute, cute.

465
00:36:26,083 --> 00:36:27,812
Main Street, USA.

466
00:36:32,123 --> 00:36:33,283
Jesus.

467
00:36:44,101 --> 00:36:45,261
Antiques.

468
00:36:51,075 --> 00:36:52,736
Look at this old crap.

469
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:55,335
I wonder where they
manufacture this shit.

470
00:37:10,828 --> 00:37:12,261
Look.

471
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:15,128
Those kids.

472
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:16,666
You didn't see them?

473
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:20,532
Where is everyone?

474
00:37:20,605 --> 00:37:22,197
It's like the place
is picture perfect..

475
00:37:22,273 --> 00:37:24,036
and there's nobody around.

476
00:37:24,108 --> 00:37:25,871
Come on.

477
00:38:04,315 --> 00:38:06,078
Styles, how'd you know
about this place?

478
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:08,880
I thought you'd never
been here before.

479
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:11,285
I haven't. I've read about it.

480
00:38:11,355 --> 00:38:12,481
So have you.

481
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:16,289
This is empty now.

482
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:19,295
It used to be filled with
strange growing things..

483
00:38:19,363 --> 00:38:20,489
remember?

484
00:38:20,564 --> 00:38:23,362
One night, the townspeople saw
something moving in here..

485
00:38:23,434 --> 00:38:27,165
something enormous,
with arms like snakes.

486
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:31,106
'Hobb's End Horror."

487
00:38:31,175 --> 00:38:33,735
The hotelfrom..

488
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:35,870
'Hobb's End Horror."

489
00:38:35,946 --> 00:38:38,312
Styles, you know
what I'm thinking?

490
00:38:38,382 --> 00:38:40,976
There's gotta be a great
tie-in for a town like this.

491
00:38:41,052 --> 00:38:44,317
I mean, think of the tourist
potential, for instance, or..

492
00:38:44,388 --> 00:38:47,380
There should be a
painting behind us.

493
00:38:49,293 --> 00:38:51,386
It's nice.

494
00:38:51,462 --> 00:38:53,327
There's a loose board there.

495
00:39:01,305 --> 00:39:02,465
Good morning.

496
00:39:03,708 --> 00:39:05,335
Can I help youfolks?

497
00:39:05,409 --> 00:39:06,501
I certainly hope so.

498
00:39:06,577 --> 00:39:08,067
We'd like a room, please.

499
00:39:08,145 --> 00:39:09,942
We're on our way to Boston.

500
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:11,447
We thought we'd take a..

501
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:13,779
break in yourfamous little town.

502
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:15,250
Famous?

503
00:39:15,319 --> 00:39:18,220
Yeah, what with the whole
Sutter Cane thing and all.

504
00:39:18,289 --> 00:39:20,223
Sut-Sutter who?

505
00:39:20,291 --> 00:39:23,783
Cane. We heard he came
from around here..

506
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:25,522
and comes back to
stay once in a while.

507
00:39:25,596 --> 00:39:29,657
Uh, I don't know
anybody named Cane.

508
00:39:31,168 --> 00:39:35,400
Ha. Nobody passes through
here much anymore.

509
00:39:35,473 --> 00:39:37,134
Let me get you your keys.

510
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:40,109
You want me to leave a deposit
or my credit card or something?

511
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:43,577
Oh, city folk.

512
00:39:49,787 --> 00:39:52,756
Miss Styles, if that's
what you saw, then..

513
00:39:52,823 --> 00:39:55,724
yeah, I guess it would be a little..
unsettling.

514
00:39:55,793 --> 00:39:57,590
I'd be a little unnerved myseif.

515
00:39:57,661 --> 00:40:01,722
But regardless of what you saw,
regardless of what you think..

516
00:40:01,799 --> 00:40:05,030
we are not living inside
a Sutter Cane story.

517
00:40:06,437 --> 00:40:08,268
They're all in here.

518
00:40:10,307 --> 00:40:12,172
The Mrs. Pickman in the
book is a lunatic..

519
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:15,542
who chops her husband
into coleslaw.

520
00:40:15,613 --> 00:40:18,741
That sweet old thing
that we met downstairs..

521
00:40:18,816 --> 00:40:21,376
isn't capable of
anything worse than..

522
00:40:22,553 --> 00:40:25,317
dipping her dentures
into her husband's beer.

523
00:40:25,389 --> 00:40:27,789
Trent, I know you
think this is a joke.

524
00:40:27,858 --> 00:40:30,224
Just listen to me for
a second, please.

525
00:40:30,294 --> 00:40:32,888
What if Cane's
work isn'tfiction?

526
00:40:32,963 --> 00:40:35,295
Oh, for Christ's sake.

527
00:40:36,867 --> 00:40:38,767
This is reality.

528
00:40:39,804 --> 00:40:41,328
You hear that?

529
00:40:41,405 --> 00:40:42,929
Reality.

530
00:40:43,007 --> 00:40:45,475
Now, if what you're
saying is true..

531
00:40:45,543 --> 00:40:47,943
there should be
out that window..

532
00:40:48,012 --> 00:40:51,539
a black Byzantine church with
two-hundred-fifty-foot spires..

533
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:53,606
with gold onions on the top.

534
00:40:53,684 --> 00:40:54,810
Now, look.

535
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:58,454
You see? Reality.

536
00:40:58,522 --> 00:41:01,320
You didn't read closely enough.

537
00:41:02,393 --> 00:41:04,884
The view is from the east.

538
00:41:13,504 --> 00:41:15,699
'This place had once been
the seat of an evil..

539
00:41:15,773 --> 00:41:17,331
'older than mankind..

540
00:41:17,408 --> 00:41:19,706

"It was a place of
pain and suffering..

542
00:41:21,278 --> 00:41:23,473
'beyond human understanding."

543
00:41:23,547 --> 00:41:26,880
You got me reading this thing
like it's a guidebook.

544
00:41:26,951 --> 00:41:28,976
"Originally, there was
an old stone church..

'with their sadistic

559
00:42:25,509 --> 00:42:27,477
It's the battle for heaven.

560
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:29,103
The archangel Michael's
fighting off..

561
00:42:29,179 --> 00:42:31,477
Don't tell me. "Fighting
off one of the creatures..

'from the other side," right?

563
00:42:33,017 --> 00:42:35,485
A representation. The things
Cane writes are indescribable.

564
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:36,645
'Beyond description."

565
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,881
Right. We're wasting our time.

566
00:42:38,956 --> 00:42:40,787
We ought to be
asking about Cane.

567
00:42:42,026 --> 00:42:44,551
We'll have somebody to ask
in about two seconds.

568
00:42:47,898 --> 00:42:50,765
Come on, we have to
get out of here.

569
00:42:50,834 --> 00:42:52,961
We can't be in front
of the church, Trent.

570
00:42:53,037 --> 00:42:54,470
They have guns, Trent.

571
00:43:11,789 --> 00:43:13,689
No, I want to go back.

572
00:43:13,757 --> 00:43:17,056
Give him back!

573
00:43:23,968 --> 00:43:25,401
Johnny!

574
00:43:25,469 --> 00:43:27,164
Johnny-boy!

575
00:43:46,724 --> 00:43:48,089
Is that Cane?

576
00:44:20,557 --> 00:44:22,491
Get in the truck!

577
00:44:24,728 --> 00:44:27,322
Where are they comingfrom?

578
00:44:47,584 --> 00:44:49,552
I see.

579
00:44:52,156 --> 00:44:55,182
Tell me how you knew
about that mob!

580
00:44:56,460 --> 00:44:58,621
You see, you can't bullshit
a bullshitter, can you?

581
00:44:58,696 --> 00:44:59,788
'Cause I'll tell you how.

582
00:44:59,863 --> 00:45:01,956
This whole thing has
been staged, that's how.

583
00:45:02,066 --> 00:45:04,125
You, Harglow, and Cane put
me through all of this..

584
00:45:04,168 --> 00:45:05,533
so I can blab to the media..

585
00:45:05,602 --> 00:45:07,502
about Cane's haunted
little town..

586
00:45:07,571 --> 00:45:09,129
help you sell a few
more million copies.

587
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:10,366
Well, fuck that.

588
00:45:10,441 --> 00:45:12,432
- You're wrong.
- No, I'm not.

589
00:45:12,509 --> 00:45:13,840
Before I leave
this shitty town..

590
00:45:13,911 --> 00:45:15,708
I'm going to find someone
who's going to come clean..

591
00:45:15,779 --> 00:45:17,974
and we're going to dismiss
your bullshit claim.

592
00:45:18,048 --> 00:45:20,414
You're wrong, Trent. I
know you are wrong.

593
00:45:20,484 --> 00:45:21,576
How am I wrong?

594
00:45:21,652 --> 00:45:24,086
Because you're right.
You're haif right.

595
00:45:24,154 --> 00:45:25,416
This was a hoax.

596
00:45:25,489 --> 00:45:27,684
We did send Cane away
on a publicity stunt..

597
00:45:27,758 --> 00:45:29,282
only he never showed up.

598
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:32,157
Harglow sent me with you
to make it look good..

599
00:45:32,229 --> 00:45:35,096
only we weren't supposed to
find anything, but we did.

600
00:45:35,165 --> 00:45:37,998
That's how I know what
we're seeing is real.

601
00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:40,298
We didn't stage any of this.

602
00:45:40,370 --> 00:45:42,361
It's all happening
for real, Trent.

603
00:45:42,439 --> 00:45:45,135
And it is all in that book,
and that's how I know.

604
00:45:45,209 --> 00:45:46,301
You're lying.

605
00:45:46,376 --> 00:45:47,843
I read the books,
too, you remember?

606
00:45:47,911 --> 00:45:50,175
There's nothing about any
mob, any little girl.

607
00:45:50,247 --> 00:45:53,341
Not in the old books, Trent.
In the new one!

608
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:58,320
No one knew what was in it
except me and Cane's agent.

609
00:46:03,794 --> 00:46:05,728
All right.

610
00:46:05,796 --> 00:46:07,787
What's it about, the new one?

611
00:46:07,865 --> 00:46:11,426
It's about the end
to everything..

612
00:46:11,502 --> 00:46:13,629
and it starts here
in this place..

613
00:46:13,704 --> 00:46:16,673
with an evil that returns
and takes over Hobb's End..

614
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:20,141
piece by piece, starting
with the children.

615
00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:23,145
It's about people
turning into things..

616
00:46:23,213 --> 00:46:25,147
creatures that aren't
human anymore.

617
00:46:25,215 --> 00:46:27,376
It's fiction, Styles, fiction.

618
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:32,047
We need to read the new
book to find the way out.

619
00:46:32,122 --> 00:46:33,612
How's that gonna help?

620
00:46:33,690 --> 00:46:36,420
We could skip to the ending.

621
00:46:36,493 --> 00:46:38,791
I really hope you're
making this up..

622
00:46:38,862 --> 00:46:41,763
because if you're not,
you're actually crazy.

623
00:46:41,832 --> 00:46:43,356
Please, Trent.

624
00:46:45,402 --> 00:46:48,132
Don't make me do
this alone, Trent.

625
00:46:53,243 --> 00:46:55,871
Are you coming with me?

626
00:46:57,948 --> 00:46:59,108
Fine.

627
00:47:00,083 --> 00:47:02,108
Have a nice bus ride home.

628
00:47:34,651 --> 00:47:36,710
No smoking, please.

629
00:47:36,787 --> 00:47:39,950
It bothers my husband.

630
00:47:40,023 --> 00:47:41,149
I'm sorry.

631
00:47:41,225 --> 00:47:43,921
I just can't seem to
help myseif around here.

632
00:47:43,994 --> 00:47:45,723
I was just on my way out.

633
00:47:45,796 --> 00:47:48,390
I thought I'd stop and
admire the artwork.

634
00:47:48,465 --> 00:47:49,989
It's beautiful, isn't it?

635
00:47:50,067 --> 00:47:52,058
Sure is.

636
00:47:52,135 --> 00:47:55,104
Styles told me you
painted it yourseif.

637
00:47:58,075 --> 00:48:03,012
You mean the pretty young
thing you came in here with?

638
00:48:04,915 --> 00:48:06,712
I don't know her at all.

639
00:48:06,783 --> 00:48:09,115
Does she know me?

640
00:48:09,186 --> 00:48:10,778
She claims she does.

641
00:48:11,822 --> 00:48:13,790
So you're not
responsible for this?

642
00:48:13,857 --> 00:48:15,950
Hell, no.

643
00:48:16,026 --> 00:48:19,553
Well, it's a nice
place you got here.

644
00:48:19,630 --> 00:48:23,259
It must be a hell of a
thing to keep clean.

645
00:48:23,333 --> 00:48:25,767
You look as if you've
been up all night.

646
00:48:27,104 --> 00:48:28,264
Been reading.

647
00:48:58,068 --> 00:48:59,968
Hush!

648
00:49:27,831 --> 00:49:29,492
You're a writer?

649
00:49:33,236 --> 00:49:34,464
You an actor?

650
00:49:34,538 --> 00:49:36,870
Take a hint, leave.

651
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:38,669
This ain't no tourist town.

652
00:49:38,742 --> 00:49:41,802
Oh, I've been trying to.

653
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:45,544
You guys are good, you know.

654
00:49:45,615 --> 00:49:47,845
You, the old lady at the hotel..

655
00:49:47,918 --> 00:49:49,579
Really, really good.

656
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:52,349
Cane's been messing
with the church.

657
00:49:52,422 --> 00:49:55,289
Now something came leaking out,
took the little ones first..

658
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:56,986
then passed it on to us.

659
00:49:58,428 --> 00:50:00,396
Can I buy you a beer?

660
00:50:00,464 --> 00:50:03,695
Don't let it get to you.
Just get out.

661
00:50:17,814 --> 00:50:19,406
Give it.

662
00:50:19,483 --> 00:50:21,542
What are you? Where
do you come from?

663
00:50:22,986 --> 00:50:24,749
Where do you live?

664
00:50:24,821 --> 00:50:26,311
With you.

665
00:50:26,390 --> 00:50:27,880
Who takes care of you?

666
00:50:27,958 --> 00:50:29,050
You do.

667
00:50:29,126 --> 00:50:31,185
You're my mommy.

668
00:50:31,261 --> 00:50:33,388
Know what today is?

669
00:50:33,463 --> 00:50:36,296
Today is Mommy's Day.

670
00:53:07,317 --> 00:53:09,342
Nice to see you again.

671
00:53:13,123 --> 00:53:18,584
You can edit this one from
the inside, looking out.

672
00:53:22,832 --> 00:53:24,265
It's funny, isn't it?

673
00:53:24,334 --> 00:53:27,735
For years, I thought I
was making all this up.

674
00:53:31,841 --> 00:53:34,537
But they were telling
me what to write..

675
00:53:45,222 --> 00:53:48,282
giving me the power
to make it all real.

676
00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:51,991
And now it is.

677
00:54:02,172 --> 00:54:05,164
All those horrible,
slimy things..

678
00:54:05,242 --> 00:54:08,439
trying to get back in?

679
00:54:08,511 --> 00:54:10,376
They're all true.

680
00:54:25,328 --> 00:54:26,590
Come.

681
00:54:28,031 --> 00:54:30,591
See the instrument
of their homecoming.

682
00:54:31,901 --> 00:54:33,869
What you have come lookingfor.

683
00:54:35,171 --> 00:54:36,661
The new Bible..

684
00:54:40,076 --> 00:54:42,670
that starts the change..

685
00:54:44,314 --> 00:54:47,181
helps you see.

686
00:55:04,301 --> 00:55:05,962
Do you like my ending?

687
00:55:11,408 --> 00:55:13,171
Any suggestions?

688
00:55:51,181 --> 00:55:52,409
Youfound something.

689
00:55:52,482 --> 00:55:54,382
Where the hell did you go?

690
00:55:54,451 --> 00:55:55,884
I'm losing me, John.

691
00:55:55,952 --> 00:55:57,749
Help me. I'm losing me.

692
00:55:59,989 --> 00:56:01,149
What's happening?

693
00:56:01,257 --> 00:56:02,656
I saw the book.

694
00:56:02,692 --> 00:56:05,456
Don't look at it.
Don't read it, John.

695
00:56:05,528 --> 00:56:08,429
I'm losing me!

696
00:56:23,613 --> 00:56:24,978
Mrs. Pickman!

697
00:56:53,676 --> 00:56:56,372
Come on, you old bitch.

698
00:58:08,685 --> 00:58:10,949
We're going. Now.

699
00:59:11,614 --> 00:59:14,208
You are a dead girl

700
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:22,620
Fuck you!

701
00:59:31,134 --> 00:59:33,830
You're still here.

702
00:59:33,903 --> 00:59:36,371
Busy night.

703
00:59:36,439 --> 00:59:39,374
Special effects,
hidden speakers.

704
00:59:39,442 --> 00:59:42,104
You people are professionals,
I'll give you that.

705
00:59:42,178 --> 00:59:45,944
The thing I can't remember
is what came first..

706
00:59:46,015 --> 00:59:47,607
us or the book.

707
00:59:49,152 --> 00:59:51,620
We are not living in
a Sutter Cane story!

708
00:59:51,688 --> 00:59:53,451
This is not reality!

709
00:59:54,791 --> 00:59:57,453
Reality is not what
it used to be.

710
00:59:57,527 --> 01:00:01,395
Oh, Jesus, this place
makes my head hurt.

711
01:00:01,464 --> 01:00:02,897
Oh, really?

712
01:00:02,966 --> 01:00:06,299
Come on, look at this.

713
01:00:06,369 --> 01:00:09,566
This was done by a
five-year-old..

714
01:00:09,639 --> 01:00:11,163
my five-year-old.

715
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:12,798
Johnny's sister.

716
01:00:12,875 --> 01:00:15,605
She did me after
she did her mom.

717
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:19,380
You're alone.

718
01:00:24,721 --> 01:00:27,087
Shit. Don't.

719
01:00:27,156 --> 01:00:29,784
I have to. He wrote me this way.

720
01:01:01,924 --> 01:01:04,358
Oh, shit. The key.

721
01:01:10,533 --> 01:01:12,398
Jesus!

722
01:01:22,945 --> 01:01:24,173
Christ.

723
01:01:27,483 --> 01:01:28,643
Shit.

724
01:01:55,044 --> 01:01:58,241
Never leave the city.
Why don't I learn?

725
01:01:59,248 --> 01:02:00,806
Are we leaving?

726
01:02:02,251 --> 01:02:03,946
We're already home.

727
01:02:04,020 --> 01:02:05,988
You should have believed me.

728
01:02:07,090 --> 01:02:09,251
Where's the fucking highway?

729
01:02:09,325 --> 01:02:11,919
Cane's writing me. He
wants me to kiss you.

730
01:02:11,994 --> 01:02:13,518
Why?

731
01:02:13,596 --> 01:02:15,120
Because it's goodfor the book.

732
01:02:15,198 --> 01:02:16,290
Jesus!

733
01:02:16,365 --> 01:02:17,593
It's what the readers
want to read.

734
01:02:17,667 --> 01:02:18,793
Oh, God!

735
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:27,437
Go! Get.. get away from me!

736
01:02:53,436 --> 01:02:56,030
Cane has a job for you.

737
01:04:01,604 --> 01:04:04,072
Afew bad calls.

738
01:04:04,140 --> 01:04:05,903
Afew wrong turns.

739
01:06:46,936 --> 01:06:50,895
Do you want to know the problem
with places like this?

740
01:06:50,973 --> 01:06:52,964
With religion in general?

741
01:06:53,042 --> 01:06:58,105
It's never known how to
convey the anatomy of horror.

742
01:06:58,180 --> 01:07:00,978
Religion seeks discipline
through fear..

743
01:07:01,083 --> 01:07:04,177
yet doesn't understand the
true nature of creation.

744
01:07:05,654 --> 01:07:09,454
No one's ever believed it
enough to make it real.

745
01:07:10,726 --> 01:07:13,354
The same cannot be
said of my world.

746
01:07:14,563 --> 01:07:17,396
Your books aren't real.

747
01:07:17,466 --> 01:07:20,299
But they've sold over
a billion copies.

748
01:07:20,369 --> 01:07:23,930
I've been translated
into eighteen languages.

749
01:07:24,006 --> 01:07:27,772
More people believe in my work
than believe in the Bible.

750
01:07:31,781 --> 01:07:33,271
You got a point?

751
01:07:40,022 --> 01:07:41,717
I think you know it.

752
01:07:42,958 --> 01:07:45,119
There has to be some
kind of an explanation..

753
01:07:45,194 --> 01:07:46,821
for what I've seen tonight.

754
01:07:46,896 --> 01:07:49,865
I'll sort this shit out
later, but right now..

755
01:07:49,932 --> 01:07:53,299
there has to be some kind of a
simple fucking explanation.

756
01:07:53,369 --> 01:07:57,066
Always lookingfor the con.

757
01:07:57,139 --> 01:08:00,506
Even now you're trying
to rationalize.

758
01:08:03,179 --> 01:08:05,477
Anyway..

759
01:08:05,548 --> 01:08:07,345
your books suck.

760
01:08:13,322 --> 01:08:16,587
You must try reading my new one.

761
01:08:16,659 --> 01:08:19,526
The others have had
quite an effect..

762
01:08:19,595 --> 01:08:22,826
but this one will drive
you absolutely mad.

763
01:08:26,102 --> 01:08:28,161
So I'm told.

764
01:08:28,237 --> 01:08:32,037
It'll make the world
ready for the change.

765
01:08:32,108 --> 01:08:33,370
It takes its power..

766
01:08:33,442 --> 01:08:36,070
from new readers
and new believers.

767
01:08:36,145 --> 01:08:39,114
That's the point. Belief!

768
01:08:39,181 --> 01:08:42,810
When people begin to
lose their ability..

769
01:08:42,885 --> 01:08:47,117
to know the difference between
fantasy and reality..

770
01:08:47,189 --> 01:08:52,889
the old ones can begin
their journey back.

771
01:08:52,962 --> 01:08:56,125
The more people who believe,
the faster the journey.

772
01:08:57,867 --> 01:09:00,893
And with the way the
other books have sold..

773
01:09:01,003 --> 01:09:04,939
this one is bound to
be very, very popular.

774
01:09:08,110 --> 01:09:09,873
Want to see?

775
01:09:23,159 --> 01:09:24,319
All done.

776
01:09:31,233 --> 01:09:33,724
'Ln the Mouth of Madness."

777
01:09:40,776 --> 01:09:42,641
Yours to deliver, Trent.

778
01:09:43,979 --> 01:09:45,207
What?

779
01:09:45,281 --> 01:09:47,977
I will be joining my
new publishers now.

780
01:09:52,855 --> 01:09:56,120
You take the manuscript
back to the worldfor me..

781
01:09:56,192 --> 01:09:57,352
that's what you do.

782
01:09:57,426 --> 01:09:59,792
What I do?

783
01:10:03,465 --> 01:10:05,456
You are what I write.

784
01:10:07,102 --> 01:10:09,662
Like this town.

785
01:10:09,738 --> 01:10:11,433
It wasn't here
before I wrote it.

786
01:10:11,507 --> 01:10:13,998
And neither were you.

787
01:10:18,013 --> 01:10:19,913
I know what's real.

788
01:10:19,982 --> 01:10:22,212
I know what I am..

789
01:10:22,284 --> 01:10:23,979
and nobody pulls my strings.

790
01:10:26,088 --> 01:10:29,580
Did you think my agent
attacked you by accident?

791
01:10:30,793 --> 01:10:33,318
He read about you.. in there.

792
01:10:33,395 --> 01:10:37,331
He knew you'd bring it back
and start the change..

793
01:10:37,399 --> 01:10:39,560
make what's happened
here happen everywhere.

794
01:10:39,635 --> 01:10:41,626
He tried to stop you.

795
01:10:43,472 --> 01:10:45,440
I'm not a piece of fiction.

796
01:10:46,508 --> 01:10:48,738
I think, therefore you are.

797
01:10:51,447 --> 01:10:53,779
Read it if you don't believe me.

798
01:10:55,117 --> 01:10:57,915
See what I have
in store for you.

799
01:11:00,022 --> 01:11:01,649
I know what I am.

800
01:11:11,133 --> 01:11:12,293
Go back.

801
01:11:14,069 --> 01:11:17,232
Your world lies
beyond that passage.

802
01:11:28,317 --> 01:11:30,217
Go now.

803
01:11:30,286 --> 01:11:33,585
I can't hold them
back any longer.

804
01:12:26,375 --> 01:12:29,037
"Trent stood at the
edge of the rip..

805
01:12:29,111 --> 01:12:33,605
'stared into the illimitable

01:12:49,064 --> 01:12:51,532
'as in the same
second he saw them..

812
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:53,898
'spill and tumble upward..

813
01:12:53,969 --> 01:12:57,962
'out of an enormous
carrion black pit..

814
01:12:58,040 --> 01:13:01,032
"choked with the
gleaming white bones..

815
01:13:01,143 --> 01:13:04,670
"of countless
unhallowed centuries.

816
01:13:04,713 --> 01:13:06,510
'He began to back
away from the rip..

817
01:13:06,582 --> 01:13:09,449
"as the army of
unspeakable figures..

818
01:13:09,518 --> 01:13:12,282
"twilit by the glow from
the bottomless pit..

819
01:13:12,354 --> 01:13:15,187
'came pouring at him
toward our world."

820
01:13:18,861 --> 01:13:20,055
Come with me.

821
01:13:21,797 --> 01:13:23,355
I can't.

822
01:13:23,432 --> 01:13:26,094
I've read to the end.

823
01:14:42,377 --> 01:14:45,403
Hey, kid.

824
01:14:49,318 --> 01:14:50,842
You want a paper?

825
01:14:58,227 --> 01:15:01,025
Have you been in an accident?

826
01:15:04,266 --> 01:15:06,257
You want me to get somebody?

827
01:15:08,337 --> 01:15:09,804
No. Just..

828
01:15:11,473 --> 01:15:14,169
Just point me to the highway.

829
01:15:14,243 --> 01:15:17,406
Straight up.

830
01:15:21,850 --> 01:15:23,010
Hey, kid.

831
01:15:27,589 --> 01:15:29,921
Did you ever hear of Hobb's End?

832
01:17:04,052 --> 01:17:05,178
What?

833
01:17:05,253 --> 01:17:07,847
Package for you, sir.

834
01:17:07,923 --> 01:17:10,221
But nobody knows I'm here.

835
01:17:10,292 --> 01:17:12,522
Well, someone does.

836
01:17:40,088 --> 01:17:41,646
Who delivered this?

837
01:17:41,723 --> 01:17:42,985
I don't know.

838
01:17:43,058 --> 01:17:44,150
Who?!

839
01:17:44,226 --> 01:17:45,659
I don't know! I wasn't
here last night.

840
01:17:45,727 --> 01:17:46,819
Who was it?!

841
01:17:46,895 --> 01:17:49,489
I was. And I didn't see shit.

842
01:18:09,051 --> 01:18:12,953
I remember New York
during the Depression.

843
01:18:13,021 --> 01:18:16,184
They think they have it bad now.

844
01:18:16,258 --> 01:18:19,750
You should have seen
the Bowery back then.

845
01:18:19,828 --> 01:18:24,356
Bodies piled two, three
feet high off the gutter.

846
01:18:43,351 --> 01:18:45,319
I'm not going anywhere.

847
01:18:45,387 --> 01:18:48,845
I'm God now. You understand?

848
01:18:48,924 --> 01:18:51,358
God's not supposed to be
a hack horror writer.

849
01:18:51,426 --> 01:18:55,089
But maybe I can
help you believe.

850
01:18:55,163 --> 01:18:56,960
Look around when you wake up.

851
01:18:57,032 --> 01:19:01,731
Did I ever tell you my
favorite color was blue?

852
01:19:22,390 --> 01:19:23,687
Relax, buddy.

853
01:19:23,759 --> 01:19:25,784
Relax. You're awake now.

854
01:19:25,861 --> 01:19:28,887
It was just a bad dream.

855
01:19:30,632 --> 01:19:33,123
Are you deaf and dumb, sir?

856
01:19:34,936 --> 01:19:37,905
I was just there in the town..

857
01:19:37,973 --> 01:19:39,998
in that town, and..

858
01:19:40,075 --> 01:19:41,542
there were people there..

859
01:19:41,610 --> 01:19:43,202
and shops and homes and..

860
01:19:43,278 --> 01:19:45,075
I don't doubt that.

861
01:19:45,147 --> 01:19:47,672
What I'm telling you
for the tenth time..

862
01:19:47,749 --> 01:19:50,047
is that it couldn't have
been called Hobb's End.

863
01:19:50,118 --> 01:19:53,576
There never was, is, or
shall be any such place..

864
01:19:53,655 --> 01:19:55,350
by that name in this state.

865
01:19:55,423 --> 01:19:56,583
Ever.

866
01:19:56,658 --> 01:19:58,990
I want to see your supervisor!

867
01:20:44,172 --> 01:20:46,265
Well..

868
01:20:46,341 --> 01:20:48,536
that is quite a story.

869
01:20:48,610 --> 01:20:50,737
If you could write
it, I'd publish it.

870
01:20:52,747 --> 01:20:54,647
You don't believe it, do you?

871
01:20:57,519 --> 01:20:59,146
If I don't, what's my option?

872
01:20:59,221 --> 01:21:02,418
That I'm crazy?

873
01:21:02,524 --> 01:21:04,185
I'm not crazy.

874
01:21:05,227 --> 01:21:07,024
Have you heard the rumors..

875
01:21:07,095 --> 01:21:12,032
that Cane's books have
affected certain readers?

876
01:21:12,100 --> 01:21:14,432
Yeah. Styles told me.

877
01:21:14,502 --> 01:21:18,939
Styles.. Oh, that's the girl
you say I sent with you.

878
01:21:19,007 --> 01:21:22,238
But I know I sent you off alone.

879
01:21:22,310 --> 01:21:25,837
Why wouldn't I remember her?

880
01:21:30,585 --> 01:21:32,917
Well..

881
01:21:32,988 --> 01:21:35,855
That's easy. She
was written out.

882
01:21:35,924 --> 01:21:37,516
Written out?

883
01:21:37,592 --> 01:21:40,686
Look, do you think..

884
01:21:40,762 --> 01:21:43,754
those books somehow
infected you?

885
01:21:43,832 --> 01:21:45,959
Listen to me, Harglow.

886
01:21:46,034 --> 01:21:49,663
Everything I've said is true.
It's real.

887
01:21:49,738 --> 01:21:52,798
And that's why I had to
destroy the last manuscript.

888
01:21:52,874 --> 01:21:55,866
But I know that's not true.

889
01:21:57,746 --> 01:21:59,145
What are you talking about?

890
01:21:59,214 --> 01:22:02,206
You delivered that
manuscript to me months ago.

891
01:22:02,317 --> 01:22:05,718
To me personally in this room.

892
01:22:05,754 --> 01:22:06,846
I did?

893
01:22:06,922 --> 01:22:10,085
Yes, you did. Last spring.

894
01:22:10,158 --> 01:22:13,093
For God's sakes, we
published in July.

895
01:22:13,161 --> 01:22:14,856
The book's been in the
stores for seven weeks.

896
01:22:17,365 --> 01:22:18,491
Have you read it?

897
01:22:18,566 --> 01:22:21,194
No. I never read Cane's work.

898
01:22:21,269 --> 01:22:22,930
I haven't got the
stomach for it.

899
01:22:23,004 --> 01:22:25,973
Pull it. Don't distribute it.

900
01:22:26,041 --> 01:22:29,135
Even if everything I've said
is totally Looney Tunes..

901
01:22:29,210 --> 01:22:31,940
I know this book will
drive people crazy.

902
01:22:32,013 --> 01:22:35,141
Well, let's hope so.

903
01:22:35,216 --> 01:22:37,411
The movie comes out next month.

904
01:22:38,753 --> 01:22:41,119
Oh, Christ.

905
01:22:49,631 --> 01:22:51,656
The newest, and presumably
posthumous, work..

906
01:22:51,733 --> 01:22:55,169
of Sutter Cane continues
to sit at number one..

907
01:22:55,236 --> 01:22:56,794
on the best-seller list.

908
01:22:56,871 --> 01:22:58,930
'Ln the Mouth of Madness"
is expected to break..

909
01:22:59,007 --> 01:23:01,703
all previous publishing records.

910
01:23:01,810 --> 01:23:04,404
On the local scene, police
are at a loss to explain..

911
01:23:04,446 --> 01:23:07,938
the outbreak of violent crime
among the city's clergy.

912
01:23:08,016 --> 01:23:10,041
The mayor has called
an emergency meeting..

913
01:23:10,118 --> 01:23:12,348
of law enforcement and
medical agencies..

914
01:23:12,420 --> 01:23:16,413
to discuss an apparent epidemic
of paranoid schizophrenia.

915
01:23:16,491 --> 01:23:18,925
Just an unbelievably
horrible story, Bob.

916
01:23:18,994 --> 01:23:20,427
What began locally..

917
01:23:20,495 --> 01:23:22,827
has now broken out into
a global epidemic.

918
01:23:22,897 --> 01:23:25,422
An epidemic of
monumental proportions..

919
01:23:25,500 --> 01:23:29,436
of senseless, seemingly
unmotivated acts of violence.

920
01:23:30,805 --> 01:23:31,897
Like the book?

921
01:23:31,973 --> 01:23:33,463
I love it.

922
01:23:33,541 --> 01:23:36,442
Good.

923
01:23:36,511 --> 01:23:38,672
Then this shouldn't
come as a surprise.

924
01:23:44,552 --> 01:23:46,884
Jeez! I don't believe
he did that!

925
01:23:55,263 --> 01:23:57,094
It's spreading out
there, isn't it?

926
01:23:59,734 --> 01:24:01,599
Just because you
know the symptoms..

927
01:24:01,703 --> 01:24:03,796
doesn't mean to say
your story's true.

928
01:24:03,838 --> 01:24:06,773
It's Cane's story..

929
01:24:06,841 --> 01:24:08,775
and it'll spread with
each new reader.

930
01:24:08,843 --> 01:24:12,711
That's how it gets its power.

931
01:24:12,781 --> 01:24:16,774
What about the people
who don't read?

932
01:24:19,487 --> 01:24:21,478
There's a movie.

933
01:24:22,991 --> 01:24:24,618
Oh, yes, of course.

934
01:24:31,666 --> 01:24:33,190
I'm gonna leave now..

935
01:24:33,268 --> 01:24:36,362
but I'll be coming
back, I promise.

936
01:24:36,438 --> 01:24:38,429
I want to help you.

937
01:24:38,506 --> 01:24:39,632
There's no hurry.

938
01:24:39,707 --> 01:24:42,699
It's safer in here now.

939
01:24:42,777 --> 01:24:45,769
It'll get worse out there.

940
01:24:45,847 --> 01:24:47,007
Why?

941
01:24:50,385 --> 01:24:53,149
Every species can smell
its own extinction.

942
01:24:53,221 --> 01:24:56,315
The last ones left..

943
01:24:56,391 --> 01:24:58,655
won't have a pretty time of it.

944
01:24:58,726 --> 01:25:03,891
And in ten years, maybe less..

945
01:25:03,998 --> 01:25:07,729
the human race will just
be a bedtime story..

946
01:25:07,769 --> 01:25:09,066
for their children.

947
01:25:09,137 --> 01:25:11,867
A myth. Nothing more.

948
01:25:32,327 --> 01:25:35,125
Did he have anything to say?

949
01:25:36,297 --> 01:25:38,697
No. It was useless.

950
01:25:38,766 --> 01:25:41,496
He thinks he's fiction..

951
01:25:41,569 --> 01:25:44,504
and that Sutter Cane's
causing the epidemic.

952
01:25:47,075 --> 01:25:50,476
Do you read Sutter Cane?

953
01:26:44,866 --> 01:26:46,026
Oh, God!

954
01:28:33,374 --> 01:28:35,342
I'll try and continue..

955
01:28:35,410 --> 01:28:38,504
this emergency broadcast as
long as we can hold out here.

956
01:28:38,579 --> 01:28:41,810
Um, the city is almost
completely deserted now.

957
01:28:41,883 --> 01:28:44,351
There are only a few stragglers
left on the streets.

958
01:28:44,419 --> 01:28:46,614
There are no emergency services.

959
01:28:46,688 --> 01:28:49,953
The fires continue to
burn out of control.

960
01:28:50,024 --> 01:28:53,824
This incredible epidemic
of random mass killing..

961
01:28:53,895 --> 01:28:56,591
has spread to every country
in the civilized world.

962
01:28:56,664 --> 01:28:59,963
Every hour, more people
are becoming infected..

963
01:29:00,001 --> 01:29:03,698
being driven to senseless
acts of extreme violence.

964
01:29:03,738 --> 01:29:06,263
We have gotten reports,
sketchy at best..

965
01:29:06,341 --> 01:29:10,573
of people mutating, their bodies
swelling and distorting..

966
01:29:10,645 --> 01:29:13,011
changing somehow.

967
01:29:13,081 --> 01:29:16,175
Locally, the mass killings
appear to have moved inland.

968
01:29:16,250 --> 01:29:18,775
All the major cities on the
East Coast are silent.

969
01:29:18,853 --> 01:29:20,218
We lost contact
with Los Angeles..

970
01:29:20,288 --> 01:29:22,051
and the West Coast last night..

971
01:29:22,123 --> 01:29:24,023
so it's impossible at
this time to know..

972
01:29:24,092 --> 01:29:26,458
how many unaffected
people are left.

973
01:29:26,527 --> 01:29:29,621
If for any reason..

974
01:29:29,697 --> 01:29:32,666
you are one of us who
hasn't become infected..

975
01:29:32,734 --> 01:29:34,429
take shelter immediately.

976
01:29:34,502 --> 01:29:36,470
Do not trust any friends
orfamily members.

977
01:29:36,537 --> 01:29:39,563
I repeat.. Do not..

978
01:29:48,416 --> 01:29:51,544
I'm sorry about the balls! It
was a lucky shot, that's all!

979
01:29:51,619 --> 01:29:53,109
What?!

980
01:29:53,187 --> 01:29:55,485
I am not insane.

981
01:29:55,556 --> 01:29:58,992
Do you hear me? I am not insane!

982
01:30:02,163 --> 01:30:05,132
Relax, buddy. You're awake now.

983
01:30:06,768 --> 01:30:09,532
This is not a Sutter Cane story!
This is not reality!

984
01:30:09,604 --> 01:30:11,265
Not reality! Not reality!

985
01:30:11,339 --> 01:30:13,807
This is reality.

986
01:30:37,370 --> 01:30:39,100
