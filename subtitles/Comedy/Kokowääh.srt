1
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,400
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

2
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,760
Tonight's show is a real highlight.

3
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,240
Our guest isn't only

4
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:28,960
highly intelligent

5
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,560
but also extremely beautiful.

6
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:36,200
We'll be talking to a German author
recently selected by Time magazine

7
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:40,400
as one of the 100
most influential people in the world.

8
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:44,560
Her books have appeared
in over 100 countries.

9
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,520
Welcome, Katharina Meese.
- Good evening.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,040
It's an honor to have you here.
- Thank you.

11
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,280
Your novel "Free Flight"

12
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,000
will be filmed. This is surprising,

13
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:00,000
because you're known as a fierce critic
of film adaptations of novels. - Yes.

14
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:01,440
What happened?

15
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:04,760
After long negotiations,
I was satisfied that I would...

16
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,640
...get lots of money?

17
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:11,200
It has been rumored
that the successful filmmaker

18
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,560
Rob Kaufmann will be directing...

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,440
Henry Lehnbach is not home.
- Geez, Henryl

20
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,760
Is the man in white the right choice?

21
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:23,080
Henry, it's your agent, pick upl
I know you're therel

22
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,040
I've got big, big news for youl
Be at CafÃ© Einstein tomorrow at 11.

23
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,560
Be on time!

24
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,520
Esther, you're an hour early.

25
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,440
Who's Esther?
It's me, Bine!

26
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,520
Who?
- Bine!

27
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,080
I thought you were in Tibet. - I'm back.
Open up! - I can't today.

28
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,520
Why not?
- I have to write.

29
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,400
I have a deadline tomorrow.
- You won't regret it.

30
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,120
Let me just say
"Kamasutra."

31
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,960
Okay, but only a half hour.

32
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,680
You know, when you're there, looking

33
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,560
at the mountains

34
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,240
and the people there, it's so unreal.

35
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:16,440
It's not about changing my ring tone.

36
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:20,000
I really changed myself, you know?
I know where I stand

37
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,160
and where I can be myself.

38
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,560
I learned how to find and love myself,

39
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,840
how to articulate myself.

40
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,960
It's important for a woman to learn

41
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,840
to put her needs first. - Time's up.

42
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:35,640
Don't be so uptight.
Come back over here.

43
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,080
Oh, no more condoms. Too bad.

44
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:44,680
So get some while I wait here patiently,

45
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:48,080
watching TV. - Another time, sure.
I'm expecting someone.

46
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,960
Yeah? Who?
- You'll miss your bus!

47
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,560
Pipe down, I can't hear.
- Out of my bed, now!

48
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,680
Are you crazy? - Out!
- Forget it. I won't be pushed around

49
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,760
by the likes of you!

50
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,960
You know what? I'll go get condoms.

51
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,640
That's more like it.

52
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:17,480
Esther, you're 20 minutes early.
- What's the problem?

53
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,280
I wanted to spruce up for you.
- Out here?

54
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,680
Who is she?
- Who's who?

55
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,840
The woman who just answered the door.
- My mother.

56
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,000
I thought she was dead.
- Me, too.

57
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,120
You're such an asshole.

58
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,360
Come, let's go to your place.
- I came all the way from Potsdam.

59
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,520
Potsdam's nice.
- You take me upstairs right now

60
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,280
and introduce me to that woman.
- No way.

61
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,720
380 Euros?
- That's right.

62
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:48,800
You guys take checks? - Is there a sign
on my face that says I'm an idiot?

63
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,400
Cut me some slack, guys. I need the car.
- I get the money,

64
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,920
you get the car.
No money, the car goes to Africa.

65
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,920
To Africa?
- Africa.

66
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,040
Do you at least have a garage
to keep it in? - A garage?

67
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,800
Does this look like a 5 star hotel?

68
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,720
Send the piece of crap to Africa.

69
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,680
Can you lend me 380 Euros?

70
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:45,000
You're late and ask for cash
rather than apologize?

71
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,640
No more loans. Ask your honeys.

72
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,600
250?
- Forget it.

73
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,840
Alright, so what's the big news?

74
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:58,400
The "Forest Ranger" is being canceled.
- No. - Yes.

75
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,640
The ratings are awful.

76
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:05,920
What's so funny? How am I supposed
to pay my rent? - Just sign here.

77
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:11,080
What's this? - Katharina Meese
wants you to write her film adaptation.

78
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,040
Is this candid camera?
- I thought so, too,

79
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,320
but there was no camera

80
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:25,760
and Alan Funt didn't jump out either.
It can't be an April fools' joke,

81
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,680
because it's the middle of July.
Don't you get it? It's your comeback!

82
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,080
Aren't you happy?
- But why me?

83
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,840
You used to write
such beautiful stuff together.

84
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:43,080
Maybe she still loves you.
But what does it matter, really?

85
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,520
She wants to meet you tonight at 8.
So put on something nice

86
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,440
and be on time for a change.
You can manage that, right?

87
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,080
May I?

88
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,680
What?
- You left the tag on.

89
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,960
God, how embarrassing.
- I'll get it.

90
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,920
1,200 Euros?
- It's cashmere.

91
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,920
You used to think that
anything over 200 Euros was immoral.

92
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,320
Yeah, it is.
- So why do you buy it?

93
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,800
Should I feel guilty?
- No, it's okay.

94
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,680
You can afford it. You're on a roll.

95
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:31,480
Are you going to do it? - Who else
could make a good script of your novel?

96
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,600
You've read my novel?
- Yeah.

97
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,960
You never read other people's stuff.
- Well, it was my idea.

98
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,320
You thought it was crap.
- No reason to steal it from me.

99
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,240
You gave it to me.

100
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:46,240
Gave it? You snooped around my garbage
and took it with you.

101
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:49,080
I wasn't snooping. I took it

102
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:52,720
when you threw me out and told me
I could keep the trash because

103
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,640
our relationship was worth just as much.
- Let's change the subject.

104
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,520
You have a boyfriend?

105
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,800
I had one. Unfortunately,
he had the same problem as you.

106
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:16,480
And what's that?
- He couldn't handle my independence.

107
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,920
Really? What a loser.

108
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,040
Why is it that all men
have a problem with that?

109
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:27,360
Instead of being proud of their partner?
- I was always proud of you.

110
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:33,760
You did a good job of hiding it.
- I didn't want you to get a big head.

111
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:38,000
Yeah, right.
And do you have a girlfriend?

112
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,280
No, I enjoy my freedom.
I'm completely autonomous.

113
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,640
If I'm having a crappy day, which
almost never happens, it's my problem.

114
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,960
Did you ever miss me?
- Yeah, a lot.

115
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,360
Really?
- Yeah.

116
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:56,920
Then I would tell myself that I
was just idealizing our relationship.

117
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,640
Men do that.
- Do they?

118
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:03,920
Men only remember the good times,
women only remember what went wrong.

119
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,600
That's not true.
- Yes, it is. Let's do a little test.

120
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,280
Our trip to New York.

121
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:13,360
You're a piece of work.
We never went to New York.

122
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,280
You're full of it.

123
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,320
See, you're a woman
and you can't remember.

124
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:27,120
Your place? - No, yours.
I still don't have a lock on the trash.

125
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,600
Here we are.

126
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,560
What'll you have? Whisky?
- Whisky.

127
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,360
Maria, please get him a whisky.

128
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:06,440
I have to freshen up.
Oh. Henry... Maria.

129
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,080
Good evening, Henry.

130
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,880
Good evening.

131
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,840
Nice place.
- Yes.

132
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,880
You been here long?
- 2 years.

133
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,520
What's a place like this cost?
- It's better if you ask Katharina.

134
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,560
Here you go.
- Thanks.

135
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,040
Have a seat, it's very comfortable.

136
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,440
Okay.

137
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,280
Yeah.

138
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,200
What the hell?

139
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:34,880
Cool, huh?

140
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,640
Ha, I knew that one.

141
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Orange juice?

142
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,960
Yes, please.

143
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,520
Join us.

144
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,400
Katharina, while you two
were sleeping like babies, I had lunch.

145
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,760
Orange juice?
- Thanks.

146
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,760
Oh God, it's 12:30 already.
We can't do this. - But it was great.

147
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:28,080
Anything else?
- That's all, thanks.

148
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,360
Bon appÃ©tit.

149
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,880
It was great, but we can't do it again.
- Why the hell not?

150
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,760
Henry,
I want to write the perfect script.

151
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,720
When we've done that,
we can lay around all day

152
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:45,280
and screw our heads off.
- I don't need any incentives.

153
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,480
This is no joke.
I need to be able to depend on you.

154
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:52,120
No ego trips. We're a team,
and teammates listen to each other.

155
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,880
You listen to me.

156
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,040
In a team, both people have to function.
When we set a time, you're there

157
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:01,640
and ready to go.
You have to pull yourself together

158
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:05,720
and concentrate fully on this project.
From now on, it's all about our film.

159
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,920
Finished?

160
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,680
Yeah.
- You sound just like you used to.

161
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:15,040
You talk to me as if I were a moron.
I've had it with that.

162
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,040
I just need to know
if we can write together.

163
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,760
Can we do that?
- Yeah. - Good.

164
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:26,680
But don't treat me like a 4-year-old.
- Sorry.

165
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,720
And tell your maid
to quench the eggs properly.

166
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,600
Okay.

167
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,600
So tomorrow at 9, my place?
- Tomorrow at 9, your place.

168
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,720
What about my egg?

169
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,120
Oh shit!

170
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,520
Are you Henry?

171
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,480
Who wants to know?
- Paris Hilton's sister. Duh, me.

172
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,920
You got a problem?

173
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:21,160
I'm supposed to give you this.
I'm staying with you.

174
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,600
What?
- I'm supposed to stay with you.

175
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,480
Who are you?
- Magdalena. It's all in the letter.

176
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,400
You can come out now! Joke's over!

177
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:40,720
Are you stupid? There's no one there.

178
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,440
Mommy said you should read the letter.

179
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,560
Listen up: You're going home to mommy
and I'm going in there.

180
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,240
And no ding dong ditching.

181
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,760
I know you're behind the door!

182
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,480
You have to read the letter!

183
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:00,520
Dear Henry, what I have to say
might come as a shock,

184
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:05,040
so please sit down.
The little girl who gave you this letter

185
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,000
is your daughter. Her name is Magdalena

186
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,720
and she's eight years old.
I presume you're rather surprised...

187
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,200
Who brought you?
- Mommy's friend.

188
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,640
She said she'd wait till I got in.

189
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,800
Where's your mom?
- In New York.

190
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,080
Great.
- I'm supposed to stay with you.

191
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:01,440
Who says?
- Mommy. - She's crazy!

192
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:06,320
Sometimes.
But it's only for four weeks this time.

193
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:31,320
Want one?
- Ha ha, very funny.

194
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:46,840
What are you doing?
- What does it look like?

195
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,320
Smoking's bad for you.
- Yeah? - Yeah.

196
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:54,280
You know what? This is my apartment
and I do what I want, got it?

197
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:06,720
Smoking is still bad for you.
It gives you cancer, ages your skin,

198
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,520
and you stink.

199
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,560
Thanks.

200
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:17,160
My daddy also stopped smoking for me.

201
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,960
You got a problem?

202
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:38,160
So you're exactly eight.
- How could you be not exactly eight?

203
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,240
Do your parents always drop you off

204
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:50,280
at strangers' houses? - Only friends,
and mommy says you're an old friend.

205
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,880
How old are you?
- 42.

206
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:57,400
Then you're 34 years older than me,
just like my dad.

207
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,240
Do you have a men-life crisis, too?

208
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,440
Mom says all men have one because
they're afraid they'll miss something.

209
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:07,160
Where's your dad?
- At work.

210
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,200
What's he do?

211
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:13,120
My dad is the best orthodontist
in all of Berlin.

212
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,040
What's his name?
- Tristan.

213
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,360
And what's his last name?
- Same as mine.

214
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,320
And what's your last name?
- Walser.

215
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:26,240
Walser! That's funny! I've got
an appointment with him right now.

216
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,960
Really?
- Yeah.

217
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,200
Is the doctor in?
- He's with a patient. - Great.

218
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,760
Do you have an appointment?

219
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,400
I don't need one.

220
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,120
What the hell's going on?
- We need to have a chat.

221
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:01,960
See my receptionist for an appointment.
- It's about your daughter.

222
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:07,160
Is something wrong?
- No. She's at the front desk.

223
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,120
What do you have to do with my daughter?
- Nada.

224
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:19,120
Magdalena, what are you doing here?

225
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:23,960
I thought you were with Christiane.
- She brought me to Henry's.

226
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:25,960
Who's Henry?

227
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,320
He is.

228
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,800
So it's you.

229
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,280
Daddy...

230
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:41,600
Are you coming back home?

231
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:46,240
What?
- Are you coming back home?

232
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,960
Chantal?

233
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,600
Make yourself useful.
Look after Magdalena.

234
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:56,400
Come, let's go play.

235
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,760
Henry Lehnbach.

236
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:17,840
The resemblance is striking, I must say.

237
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:22,920
How could I be so blind.
- I'm going to do a paternity test.

238
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,760
Come with me, I'll show you something.
I meant to mail it to you.

239
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:35,160
We conservatively estimated
average monthly costs of 590 Euros,

240
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,400
which deviates only slightly
from the federal guidelines.

241
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,400
590 times 12 times 8...

242
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:44,120
comes to 56,640 Euro on the nose.

243
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,760
Magdalena, at her mother's behest,

244
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:51,680
attends a private school. 1,100 Euros
a month times 12 times 3 makes 39,600.

245
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:55,680
Three annual vacations, summer Maldives,
winter St. Moritz, autumn Majorca,

246
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,200
14,000, 9,000, 4,000 add up to 216,000.

247
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:04,240
Plus, ballet lessons,
begun at the age of 3.

248
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:08,440
20 Euros per hour,
320 per month, 3,840 per year,

249
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,040
times 5 makes 19,200. Piano...

250
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:16,600
Well, she quit 2 years ago.

251
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:19,960
You know what? I'll let that one slide.
- Gee, thanks.

252
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:24,080
259,440 Euros.

253
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:29,360
Even if I were the father, you can't
seriously expect me to pay all that.

254
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:33,880
Considering that you ruined my life,
I think it's a small price.

255
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:37,280
It's not my fault
you always flew to the Maldives.

256
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,680
The Black Forest is nice, too.

257
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:42,800
I don't care about the money.
You're broke anyway.

258
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:46,640
I never wanted to meet you,
but since you're here,

259
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:50,520
I can tell you to your face
what you've done to me.

260
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,560
I'm listening.

261
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Do you know what it's like
to love a child?

262
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,160
A love that's pure, unconditional?

263
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,400
It's the greatest feeling on earth.

264
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:06,680
When she was born,
I held her in my arms.

265
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,920
I took a year off work
just to take care of her.

266
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:13,760
I taught her how to ride a bike,

267
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,000
I never missed a single recital.

268
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:22,040
I held her hand
when her appendix was removed.

269
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:48,400
This is a dental practice.

270
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:59,520
I spent so many sleepless nights,
tossing and turning,

271
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:02,880
telling myself that it didn't matter
that she's not my daughter,

272
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:06,560
that it didn't matter that my wife,
whom I loved so dearly,

273
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:10,240
lied to me for eight years.
But I can't do it.

274
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:14,280
I just can't.
- I'm really sorry.

275
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:17,040
The thing with Charlotte...

276
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:21,160
It was an accident.
- An accident?

277
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,400
Charlotte and I
were best friends for 20 years.

278
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:27,760
We went to school together, vacations,

279
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:31,880
but we never slept together.
We were living proof

280
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:35,320
that men and women can be friends
without having sex.

281
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,920
So how did you manage
to impregnate Charlotte?

282
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,720
We met by chance
at the airport in Stockholm.

283
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,920
All flights were canceled due to snow.

284
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,080
We had to stay
in this totally overbooked hotel.

285
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:52,160
Let me guess,
only the broom closet was free. - No,

286
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:55,160
we managed to get a small single room.

287
00:25:56,920 --> 00:26:00,560
It was cold, our clothes
were damp, we were cold,

288
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,440
Ionely...
- Lonely?

289
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:06,560
Charlotte and I
were planning our wedding. - I know,

290
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,920
she told me about it.
She even invited me to come.

291
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,600
And why didn't you show up?
- I didn't get a card.

292
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:17,240
I'm so sorry.
You know why Charlotte left the girl

293
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:20,960
at your door? You're the father
and my marriage is ruined.

294
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,600
It's time to assume your responsibility.
And I must go

295
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:29,640
and tend to my patient. The poor woman's
had a cheek retractor in for 45 minutes.

296
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,560
You know where the door is.

297
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,840
Hello Henry,

298
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,960
how are you?
- Are you nuts?

299
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,520
Come pick up your daughter, now!

300
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,440
She's also your daughter.
- Cut the crap!

301
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:36,840
What the hell?
- We had sex, remember? It can happen.

302
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:40,040
We slept together one time.
- That's enough to get pregnant.

303
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:43,680
How do you know I'm the father?
- She was in the hospital.

304
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,840
Their blood types don't match.
Tristan can't be the father.

305
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:49,840
You're the only other man I was with.
- Are you sure?

306
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,560
What do you mean?
- Are you sure

307
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,200
you didn't screw anyone else?
- You're such an asshole.

308
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:58,520
Me? You betray your fiancÃ©...
- And your girlfriend?

309
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:02,120
But I didn't get pregnant! You got
pregnant and didn't even tell me!

310
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:05,040
Instead you lie to your husband
for eight years, the poor guy,

311
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:08,160
and now you leave the kid with me.
- The last thing I need

312
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,320
is a sermon from you.

313
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:13,320
Did you talk to him about it?
- Of course not.

314
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,960
I was so afraid to lose him.
He's the man of my life.

315
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,520
My life's a mess.

316
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,320
This is no vacation. It's total chaos.

317
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:24,720
My company's going under,
I don't know which way is up.

318
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,960
I've got legal trouble here.
I'll be lucky to stay out of jail.

319
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,000
I've gotta run.
- Where?

320
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,280
To court.
Take good care of my baby!

321
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:38,080
Hey, I can't take care of her.
I can't deal with kids.

322
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,000
I don't even like kids.

323
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,600
I'm counting on you.
Now I really have to go.

324
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,640
She has to be in bed by nine.

325
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:48,200
She needs a good breakfast
and a warm dinner. - I can't cook.

326
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,360
Your coq au vin is exquisite.
- It's all I know!

327
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,080
I gotta go.

328
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,520
What are you doing?
- I'm doing my homework.

329
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,000
Are you crazy?

330
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:35,440
Your mom said lights out at nine.
Now turn that light off!

331
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:39,520
Come on, it's 11:30. I need to sleep.
- I'm almost done.

332
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,200
Turn that light off.

333
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:45,520
If I don't finish
my teacher will get mad.

334
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:49,400
Give it to me, I'll do it.
- I can do it. - Come here.

335
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:05,560
I got a "D" in math.

336
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:10,600
That's not so bad.
I always got "F's" in math.

337
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,000
Really?

338
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:15,760
It's probably genetic.
- Huh?

339
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,840
That you're no good at math.
- I don't get it.

340
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,920
Forging your dad's signature?

341
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,800
I have to.
Daddy doesn't live with us anymore.

342
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:42,480
I won the silver medal in
forging signatures, you know? - Really?

343
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:47,600
Can you help me?
- If you finally go to bed.

344
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,320
There.

345
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:04,640
You can't tell anybody.
- It'll be our little secret

346
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:08,760
as long as you finally hit the hay.
- I have to brush my teeth.

347
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:15,440
Why do you have so many toothbrushes?

348
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,200
They're for guests.

349
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,480
You sure have a lot of guests.

350
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,440
Well, I'm very popular.

351
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:24,440
And they all sleep here?

352
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:28,360
Yeah, they like it here.

353
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:32,880
That's so cool.
No one ever sleeps at my house.

354
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,040
Why don't you have a wife?

355
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:43,160
I had one once, but then she went away.

356
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:44,960
How come?

357
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:50,160
Because I didn't want kids.
- Don't you like kids?

358
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,160
What's your favorite color?

359
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,920
So?
- Yellow.

360
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:04,160
Here.
- And blue and red and green.

361
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,320
These are for you.

362
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,280
Thank you.

363
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,800
Now off to bed.
- I don't have any pajamas.

364
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,880
Then sleep nude.
- Are you crazy?

365
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,880
That's so cool!

366
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:11,040
My dad's bad at sewing. Once, he wanted
to sew a button onto his pants

367
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:14,880
and almost sewed
his pants to his finger.

368
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:17,840
Oh, yeah?
That's not too good for a dentist.

369
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,640
Now off to bed with you.

370
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:27,520
Do you have an alarm clock?
- What for? We're sleeping in.

371
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:31,200
I have to go to school.
- So what time do you get up?

372
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:34,960
6:30.
- Really, at 6:30?

373
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:39,720
You can get up at 6
and make me breakfast.

374
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:41,960
Sleep tight.

375
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,640
Don't close the door!

376
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,560
Good night.

377
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:20,960
Even a mouse would go hungry here.

378
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,680
What am I supposed to eat?

379
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,480
Cheese.

380
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:32,120
Let's see what else we've got.

381
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,360
Capers?

382
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:37,960
Pickles?

383
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:41,120
Pickled herring?

384
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,280
Sorry, that's it.

385
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,200
Great. But I have to eat breakfast

386
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:50,960
or I can't concentrate at school.
- You like Cocoa Puffs?

387
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:54,040
Yeah!
- Sorry, don't have any.

388
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,320
What a comedian.

389
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:02,920
Come on, we'll grab a croissant
on the way to school.

390
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:08,520
You have to pick me up at 1.
- Are you kidding? - No.

391
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:12,320
How am I supposed to work?
- Aren't you on welfare? - Say what?

392
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,000
You don't even have a car.
- Yes, I do.

393
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:18,760
So why are we walking?
- Because they towed it.

394
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:21,480
Why?
- Because they're assholes.

395
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:24,400
What's your job?
- I'm a screenwriter.

396
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,440
What's that?

397
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,600
You like movies, right?
- Yeah.

398
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:32,600
Well, someone has to think up a story
and write it down.

399
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,160
The result is called a screenplay.

400
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:38,920
Did you write "Harry Potter"?
- No.

401
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:40,560
"Shrek"?

402
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:41,960
Nope.

403
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:45,480
"Finding Nemo"?
- Nope, didn't write that either.

404
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:49,440
That's too bad. It's really cool.
- Yeah, it's not too bad.

405
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,720
What did you write then?

406
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:55,600
I wrote the "Forest Ranger".
It's a TV show. - Sounds great.

407
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,640
You think so?

408
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,800
This tastes funny. What is it?

409
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:28,840
It's a real treat: Coq au vin.

410
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:32,360
Coco van?
- Coq au vin. It's French.

411
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:35,880
And what is it?
- Chicken in a wine sauce.

412
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,680
Are you crazy?

413
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:42,600
Alcohol is poison for kids!
- My God, then just eat the potatoes.

414
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,240
I hate potatoes.

415
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,760
Do you have cheese buns?

416
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:51,880
Hello? - Henry, where are you?
You're two hours late!

417
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:56,400
Fuck, I totally forgot.
- That's exactly what I meant. Hello?

418
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,040
I'm hungry!

419
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,080
Henry, I'm hungry!
- Zip it!

420
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,920
Do you have strawberry yoghurt?
- What? - Shut up!

421
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,800
Fried eggs?
- Who's that?

422
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:08,440
Well, it's...

423
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,360
Hello?
- What the hell?

424
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:21,880
Just put it on the heater.
That fixes it. - I don't have a heater.

425
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:24,600
Then use the toaster.

426
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:28,120
And that works?
- Yep.

427
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,080
Sure?
- Yeah.

428
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,560
The other way, keys down.

429
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,240
What are you going to feed me?

430
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:56,360
You're going to order a pizza.
Just call this number.

431
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:59,120
With that phone?
- Don't you have a cell?

432
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:01,720
The boys at school took it from me.

433
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:05,080
And you let them?
- They're stronger than me.

434
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:06,800
Oh.

435
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,360
There's the base station. You can call
with that. Look at the pictures here

436
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:15,320
and remember the one you like best.
Then you call and a nice man answers.

437
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:19,560
You tell him what you want and then
another nice man brings the pizza, okay?

438
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:22,320
Don't treat me like a 4-year-old.

439
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,040
I've ordered a pizza before.

440
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,680
I just wanted to explain.

441
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:32,040
Here's my number. You can call me here
if there's an emergency.

442
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:35,800
But only if there's an emergency, okay?
Like a fire or a burglar.

443
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,360
Burglar?
- That was a joke.

444
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,920
I've gotta run.
I'll be back in a few hours.

445
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:45,400
You have to give me money.
- Right.

446
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,560
Can you break this?
- Very funny.

447
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:01,360
Thanks.

448
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,560
Your phone is done.

449
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:07,920
Shit!

450
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:17,120
What's up?
- You have a stain on your shirt.

451
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,360
Walterstrasse 8, KohlhasenbrÃ¼ck.

452
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:28,960
Kohlhasen what?

453
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:32,560
KohlhasenbrÃ¼ck.

454
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:36,400
You know the way?
- Yeah.

455
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,520
I'm outta here.

456
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:51,040
Yeah.
- Take it easy, pal.

457
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:05,480
Pronto!
- Is this "Pizza Ital...

458
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:08,120
...iano"?
- Si, si, yes.

459
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,080
I would like

460
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,400
a mushroom pizza...
- Mushroom.

461
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:17,320
With pepperoni, ham, cheese, mushrooms,
and a big fried egg in the middle.

462
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:21,760
You want what?
- A fried egg. A big one.

463
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:25,280
Okay, what's your name?
- Walser.

464
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:29,880
No, Lehnbach.

465
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:33,000
Which one is it?
- Lehnbach! - Lehnbach.

466
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,960
Okay. Trenta minuti.

467
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,080
Can't you do it a bit faster?

468
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:45,480
You got 50 Euros for the cab?
- Did you drive via Paris?

469
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,920
I'm happy I got here at all.

470
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,440
Bambina...

471
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,160
Pizza!

472
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:08,000
Password?
- Trash.

473
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:10,400
Trash?
- Yeah.

474
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:19,200
What is this?
- I wrote twenty pages.

475
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,400
Why?
- I got started.

476
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:24,680
You didn't show. Just read it.
- Am I your proofreader?

477
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:26,880
Don't be a jerk. Just read it.

478
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:30,480
I'm not being ajerk.
But if I read this, it'll screw me up.

479
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:33,480
Just read it, okay?
- Weren't you listening?

480
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:43,640
Hello? - There's a guy with a hat
and a pizza under his arm.

481
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:47,560
That's great.
- Maybe it's just a disguise.

482
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:51,160
What do you mean?
- Maybe he's a burglar.

483
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:55,840
Tell him to slide the pizza under
the door and get lost. I have to work.

484
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:03,160
Ha ha, very funny.

485
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:07,720
Well?
- Alright, have it your way.

486
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:14,560
Dear God!

487
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:18,240
I'll put the money under the door.

488
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:22,040
You'll leave the pizza
on the ground and leave.

489
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:25,800
Nice and easy.

490
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:41,280
Now get lost!

491
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:46,920
Well?

492
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:50,880
Let me put it this way: Is this
set in stone or can we change it a bit?

493
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:53,560
A bit. What do you want to change?

494
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,640
We don't need the first twenty pages.
- What do you mean?

495
00:42:57,080 --> 00:43:00,040
Nobody needs this endless yakking
about how women feel.

496
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:04,680
It puts people to sleep.
- What do you suggest? - Nix it.

497
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:07,560
It's the start of my book!
- Exactly.

498
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:12,160
People want to see my novel.
- Your novel? - Yeah, my novel!

499
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:14,600
Who's the screenwriter, me or you?

500
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:20,440
This is great.

501
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:40,000
Where's my fried egg?

502
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:47,400
Come on. We've got a lot of work to do.
- This isn't right. We're right back

503
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:49,960
where we left off.
- What do you mean?

504
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,720
You're just like you always were.

505
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:58,360
Hello?
- Do you have any eggs?

506
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:01,720
What do you need eggs for?
- To make a fried egg.

507
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:05,160
I thought you ordered a pizza?
- It goes on top.

508
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:07,200
On top? That's gross.

509
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:11,240
It's yummy.
I'll save one for when you get home.

510
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:15,800
Okay, just don't burn the place down.
I have to work, okay?

511
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:21,440
Where were we?
- That you haven't changed a bit.

512
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:25,000
Do you even remember
how you ended our relationship?

513
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:27,440
I didn't end it. You left.

514
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:31,520
I didn't leave, you threw me out.
- I didn't throw you out.

515
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,040
You have Alzheimer's?
- Can we get on with it?

516
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:43,760
You could have apologized. - For what?
That you threw a toaster at my head?

517
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:47,040
I only did that because
you threw my laptop out the window.

518
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:51,000
It fell.
- You were ten feet from the window.

519
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:52,640
I tripped.

520
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:55,840
I had over a hundred pages on it.
Unsaved.

521
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:59,080
Let's just drink up and move on.
We can leave it in.

522
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:01,440
Oh, how generous.

523
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:46,080
Oh, shit!

524
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:53,160
Didn't you hear me?
Only in case of emergencies.

525
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:58,280
It's an emergency!
- Oh, yeah? Did you drop an egg?

526
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:02,080
The kitchen's on fire!
- Call the fire department!

527
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:04,400
I already did!
- Where are you?

528
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:06,480
At your place!
- Where?

529
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:09,080
In your living room!

530
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:12,360
Man, go outside!
- I don't need to!

531
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:16,600
Got a car for me?
- What happened? - An emergency.

532
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:19,720
I'll explain later. Well?
- The key's in the car.

533
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:38,000
Magdalena.

534
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:43,080
Are you okay?
- Yeah, I just burned my finger.

535
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:46,480
Does it hurt a lot?
- A little.

536
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:48,920
What's up with you?
- Why?

537
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:52,920
You can't leave her home alone.
Talk about neglect!

538
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:56,840
I should actually call the cops.
Where's the mother anyway?

539
00:46:57,800 --> 00:46:59,960
Out of town.
- Out of town?

540
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,440
What's your relationship to the girl?

541
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:04,120
He's my dad.

542
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:07,440
Oh, yeah?

543
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:11,960
Man, oh man.
There should be a parenting license.

544
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:16,160
Let's go, boys. Don't forget the hose.

545
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:29,520
You're really not mad?

546
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:30,840
No.

547
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:32,400
Not at all.

548
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:34,720
Actually, I'm kind of proud of you.

549
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:38,320
Why?
- Because you're so good at fibbing.

550
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:41,200
Daddy says it's bad to lie.

551
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:44,600
Sometimes,
it's not so bad not to tell the truth.

552
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:48,760
Like when? - Like when you don't want
to hurt someone's feelings.

553
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:51,960
Sleep tight.

554
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:57,840
Can you give me
a 20 or 30 Euro bill tomorrow?

555
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:03,080
Why do you need so much money?
- The boys at school told me

556
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:06,320
that they'll hurt me
if I don't give them money.

557
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:11,000
Really? You tell them
that I'll come by if they don't stop.

558
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:15,520
Can you also go get my donkey family
from daddy tomorrow?

559
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:17,200
Donkey family?

560
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:19,480
Mommy, daddy, and kid.

561
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:25,080
I'll call your dad tomorrow.
Now sleep tight.

562
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:33,320
No faking.

563
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:32,160
Did you do that?

564
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:36,280
Look, I made breakfast.
Yoghurt, buns, cheese, eggs.

565
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:38,600
I'm not hungry.

566
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:41,160
You have to eat
or you won't be able to concentrate.

567
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:44,160
I can't go to school like this.
- Why not?

568
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:47,640
Look at me.
I look like the cookie monster.

569
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:49,600
Don't be silly.

570
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:51,280
You look cute.

571
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:54,960
Do you have barrettes?
- Do I look like a woman?

572
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:59,360
A head scarf?
- I think I can help you there.

573
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:08,440
Those are the boys.

574
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:12,200
Go on. I'll wait till you're inside.

575
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:36,320
Ouch! Are you crazy?

576
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:40,160
Where's my money, baby?
- I don't have any.

577
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:43,160
Hey, what's going on here
you little butterball?

578
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:45,400
It's private.
- Private?

579
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:49,600
Did you steal her cell phone?
- She gave it to me.

580
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:52,320
That's not true. He took it from me.

581
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:59,680
It's mine now.
- You want me to kick your pudgy butt?

582
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:03,600
You can't kick kids.
- You can kick bullies who steal stuff.

583
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:07,400
You even go to heaven for it.
Hand it over.

584
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:17,160
If you do that again, I'll be back,
and I won't be so nice, got it? - Yeah.

585
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:20,920
What's with the hat anyway?
It looks stupid.

586
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:23,920
There,

587
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:26,560
looks better already.
- Yeah.

588
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:29,280
Get lost.

589
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:37,040
If the boys bug you again,

590
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:41,160
call me and I'll be here before you can
say apple pie. - Apple pie.

591
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:44,920
Thanks.

592
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:47,720
You're cool.

593
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,800
Hello.
- Hi.

594
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:40,360
What happened yesterday?

595
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:44,040
The emergency.
- Oh, that. It was nothing.

596
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:48,960
Well then...
- Henry, care to fill me in?

597
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:53,080
The neighbor's daughter
tried to fry an egg. - And?

598
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:56,920
She torched my kitchen a bit.
No big deal.

599
00:52:57,360 --> 00:53:00,680
What was she doing there?
- I look after her sometimes.

600
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:04,680
You look after a kid?
- Yeah. - Pinch me!

601
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:08,080
The mother ran off
and the dad has night shifts.

602
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:12,640
They can't afford a babysitter,
so I look after her.

603
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:15,600
How sweet.

604
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:18,400
What is it?

605
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:23,240
What?
- You've distorted everything.

606
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:26,880
It's a novel.
And what have I distorted?

607
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:29,920
That men always need
attention and validation. - It's true.

608
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:32,160
You always want to hear
how great you are.

609
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:34,520
And women don't, right?
- No.

610
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:39,680
And who stood before the mirror saying,
"I'm too fat. Do you think I'm too fat?"

611
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:41,240
That wasn't

612
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:45,200
about attention or validation.
I wanted your opinion.

613
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:49,320
Women want opinions and men validation?
- It was exhausting

614
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:52,800
constantly having to praise you.
- Oh, yeah?

615
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:55,480
It was hard to give you my opinion.

616
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:58,280
Are you saying I was too fat back then?
- No!

617
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:01,560
So what if you were a bit plump?
- So what?

618
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:05,520
I loved you as you were.
But you wanted to change me.

619
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:10,840
If we eat Italian ten times
and I want Thai once, that's no crime.

620
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:15,280
You have to compromise sometimes.
You can't always get what you want.

621
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:19,640
We ate Thai.
- Yeah, with you pouting the whole time.

622
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:24,440
You have time tonight?
- Why?

623
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:27,440
Rob wants to have dinner with us.
- I can't stand that guy.

624
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:31,480
He is the director.
- Yeah, with his white getup.

625
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:58,080
Did you steal it?
- No, I won the lottery.

626
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:02,320
Nice little cabin you've got here.

627
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:03,680
Yeah...

628
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:07,200
Because of you
I spent three months in a shabby hotel.

629
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:10,600
Why?
You didn't have to go on my account.

630
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:14,920
Did you do the test?
- Yeah. No results yet.

631
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:18,120
Here's everything.

632
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:26,000
The donkey family?
- Hold on.

633
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:53,920
Thanks.

634
00:55:57,320 --> 00:56:00,800
Where's the donkey kid?
- I couldn't find it.

635
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:06,440
Can you lend me the kids' seat?
You're not using it.

636
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:10,360
Would you like some cash, perhaps?
- 20 Euros?

637
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:12,760
No worries.

638
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:16,960
Thanks.

639
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:29,520
If you change your mind, give me a call,

640
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:32,960
or just stop by.
The address is on there.

641
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:36,920
She's your daughter, come what may.

642
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:45,920
She talks about you a lot.

643
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:04,240
Is this your car?
- No, why?

644
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:08,200
This is a no parking zone.
- I'm going, okay? - Not yet.

645
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:19,360
The kid needs a child's seat.
That would be ticket number two.

646
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:21,720
I've got one.
- I don't see one.

647
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:29,760
Here.
- Great.

648
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:32,640
In the trunk.
That's ticket number three.

649
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:35,520
Pardon?
- That was a joke.

650
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:39,360
We'll leave it at two,
and I'll ignore the rest.

651
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:54,760
Stupid asshole.
- You shouldn't say that. - He is one.

652
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:08,960
Farmer Hansen has ten cows.
For a liter of milk, he gets three cent.

653
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:14,320
Each cow makes five liters a day.
How much does he earn per day

654
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:16,480
from his cows' milk?

655
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:23,280
None! With sinking milk prices
he'd be better off selling them all!

656
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:26,920
That's easy.
- That was a joke.

657
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:28,760
Too bad.

658
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:31,040
So how much?

659
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:33,680
I don't know.

660
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:38,200
That is a hard one.
- Math sucks.

661
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:40,000
Can you just tell me?

662
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:44,800
Math is totally overrated.
You'll never need it later.

663
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:46,800
Enough homework for today.

664
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:52,560
Daddy says it's important
if you want to increase your wealth.

665
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:55,080
Your dad's not always right.

666
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:58,760
Look at me. Have you seen me use math
in the last few days? - No.

667
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:02,200
See?
- But you don't have any money either.

668
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:07,800
Good point.

669
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:12,520
Mommy says it's not important
how much money you have.

670
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,160
She's right.

671
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:19,600
It's much more important
to have friends and someone you love.

672
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:22,040
Mommy says so, too.

673
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:28,880
Why didn't you want to have any kids?

674
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:34,680
Back then I just didn't get it yet.

675
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:37,400
Do you get it now?

676
00:59:39,640 --> 00:59:40,600
I don't know,

677
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:43,800
but I think so.

678
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:55,800
How do I look?

679
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:58,200
Good. Where are you going?

680
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:02,840
Tonight, I'm meeting
the world famous director Rob Kaufmann.

681
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:04,960
What's a dissector?

682
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:08,040
A director is usually a person
with a major ego problem.

683
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:11,280
And who's going to watch me?

684
01:00:11,720 --> 01:00:16,120
You did just fine last night.
- There was a fire last night.

685
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,600
Just promise me
you won't fry any eggs.

686
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:26,920
Hello! Promise!
- I promise.

687
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:34,720
Better safe than sorry.

688
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:38,560
I can still make scrambled eggs.

689
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:01,120
Great, how are we supposed to cook now?

690
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:05,240
If we want to cook,
I'll put it back together.

691
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:08,040
In 15 minutes
you turn it off, pick clothes

692
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:11,920
for tomorrow, pack your bag, and brush
your teeth. Lights out at eight.

693
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:14,000
Got it? Hello?

694
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:16,280
Yes!

695
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:18,280
Promise?
- Promise.

696
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:19,880
Alright.

697
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:40,600
The first time I saw you, you were
wearing the exact same suit. - Really?

698
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:45,040
You were sitting in a cafÃ©, writing.
Remember?

699
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:49,720
I just watched you for two hours
and then you walked

700
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:53,200
right up to me and said,
"You're distracting me."

701
01:01:55,720 --> 01:01:57,480
Where is that idiot? I'm hungry.

702
01:01:58,280 --> 01:01:59,880
One for you,

703
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:03,560
and one for your friend. Enjoy.

704
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:10,080
Who's that?
- Oh, God.

705
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:14,520
Hey, Rob!
- Kate...

706
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:19,400
You look fabulous, as always.

707
01:02:19,880 --> 01:02:21,280
Gross.
- Oh, God.

708
01:02:21,720 --> 01:02:22,800
Thanks.

709
01:02:29,080 --> 01:02:30,120
Sore throat?

710
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:32,880
Style.

711
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:35,560
So, now we can go eat, right?
- No.

712
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:38,080
First a cigar.

713
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:42,120
I need to unwind.
It's been a real bitch of a day.

714
01:02:43,640 --> 01:02:45,880
What a fucked up producer.

715
01:02:46,360 --> 01:02:48,560
Can you imagine? A total douchebag.

716
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:52,240
Next time, I'll be my own producer.

717
01:02:52,680 --> 01:02:53,880
Seriously.

718
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:02,720
The usual, Jacques.
- But of course.

719
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:10,400
How's the script coming?

720
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:13,200
Great. We nixed the whole opening.

721
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:18,120
You did what?
- We nixed the entire beginning.

722
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:21,360
People, you can't do that.
The beginning is essential.

723
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:24,960
We need it to understand the characters.
You can't just cut the start.

724
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:28,600
Yeah, we can.
We don't want the people to fall asleep.

725
01:03:30,120 --> 01:03:33,080
We no want people sleep, yes?

726
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:38,040
You may be a fine writer, but let me
take care of the "not sleeping" part.

727
01:03:38,520 --> 01:03:41,600
I know how to grip an audience.
My last three films

728
01:03:42,040 --> 01:03:45,760
drew over nine million viewers.
- James Cameron gets that in one day.

729
01:03:46,560 --> 01:03:47,480
Henry...

730
01:03:48,680 --> 01:03:49,840
Forget it.

731
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:56,080
Cameron makes shallow entertainment.
My films have sophistication.

732
01:03:56,520 --> 01:03:58,120
The viewers count double.

733
01:03:59,080 --> 01:04:00,440
Where'd you get that rule?

734
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:04,280
Hi. I'm sorry, I'm a really big fan

735
01:04:04,760 --> 01:04:06,880
and wanted to ask for an autograph.

736
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:12,080
Leibovitz. What's your name?

737
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:16,560
I meant from her. If you could...

738
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:19,440
I'd be so happy.

739
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:22,240
I'm your biggest fan.

740
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:28,760
"For Anne..."
- Awesome. - That's me.

741
01:04:31,080 --> 01:04:34,080
So what do you do
when you're not assisting Ms. Meese?

742
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:38,600
I don't assist Ms. Meese,
we're writing a script together.

743
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:41,280
Pardon my error.

744
01:04:41,720 --> 01:04:45,440
You must have some pet project.
All talented writers have one, right?

745
01:04:45,880 --> 01:04:49,040
"The Forest Hunter"
is being canceled, I hear.

746
01:04:49,480 --> 01:04:51,360
"The Forest Ranger"!

747
01:04:55,960 --> 01:04:59,640
I've been working on a story about
a cuckold, the kid, and the other guy.

748
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:03,600
What's the central conflict?

749
01:05:04,040 --> 01:05:06,000
The central conflict is...

750
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:11,880
What is a father, actually?

751
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:16,920
So what is a father?
- That's the central conflict.

752
01:05:21,720 --> 01:05:26,120
Where's the mother? - She doesn't play
a big role. She ran off to New York.

753
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:30,480
It's about two guys facing off. One guy,

754
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:33,680
the guy who always thought
he was the father,

755
01:05:34,120 --> 01:05:36,880
loses it when he learns the truth.

756
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:38,840
And the other guy,

757
01:05:39,320 --> 01:05:42,800
who never wanted kids
but is probably the father,

758
01:05:43,240 --> 01:05:45,920
is totally overwhelmed by the situation.

759
01:05:49,560 --> 01:05:51,440
Great story. Thanks.

760
01:05:52,520 --> 01:05:56,040
Sounds a bit chaotic.
- That's the whole point.

761
01:05:56,840 --> 01:05:57,840
What genre?

762
01:05:58,280 --> 01:06:00,080
I don't really know yet.

763
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:04,320
Sounds like a classical drama.

764
01:06:06,440 --> 01:06:07,840
But it won't fly here.

765
01:06:10,840 --> 01:06:13,360
Well, guys. Let's eat, shall we?

766
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:21,400
No way!

767
01:06:21,840 --> 01:06:25,560
We'll start at nine.
- So early? - Yeah. Want a lift?

768
01:06:26,040 --> 01:06:28,240
That would be nice.
- Henry, dear!

769
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:31,560
Out buying condoms again?

770
01:06:32,040 --> 01:06:34,560
Enjoying yourselves?
- Oh, yeah!

771
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:37,000
Introductions?
- Right.

772
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:39,520
This is Katharina Meese and this is...

773
01:06:42,440 --> 01:06:43,800
He forgot our names.

774
01:06:45,360 --> 01:06:46,800
He screws too many

775
01:06:47,240 --> 01:06:48,680
to remember them.

776
01:06:49,120 --> 01:06:51,560
Right, Henry dear?
- It's been a whole week.

777
01:06:52,040 --> 01:06:54,000
You can't remember everything.

778
01:06:54,440 --> 01:06:58,280
Have you been drinking?
- We're as dry as the Sahara.

779
01:06:59,240 --> 01:07:00,840
No pun intended.

780
01:07:01,320 --> 01:07:03,560
You coming home soon?

781
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:20,480
Nice work.

782
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:23,720
Be glad we didn't scratch your eyes out.

783
01:07:55,240 --> 01:07:58,040
I said no fried eggs tonight.

784
01:07:58,520 --> 01:08:01,080
I didn't. They're scrambled.

785
01:08:08,280 --> 01:08:10,920
What're you doing here?
- You said I could come by

786
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:14,760
if I wanted to. So I did.
- Have you been drinking?

787
01:08:17,320 --> 01:08:18,680
Just a spritzer.

788
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:24,280
Aren't you going to ask me in?
- No, I'm tired.

789
01:08:25,840 --> 01:08:28,400
Where is she?
- Who?

790
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:31,520
My daughter.
- She's asleep.

791
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:35,200
I wanna see her.
- What, now?

792
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:36,800
Now or never!

793
01:08:41,360 --> 01:08:42,680
This way.

794
01:09:00,840 --> 01:09:04,720
Is that the bed
where you did it with Charlotte? - No,

795
01:09:05,160 --> 01:09:07,360
that was in Stockholm, remember?

796
01:09:08,480 --> 01:09:09,360
Oh, right.

797
01:09:10,040 --> 01:09:11,000
Right.

798
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:13,880
I'm tired. Let's go.

799
01:09:15,720 --> 01:09:17,000
Daddy...

800
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:20,360
what are you doing here?

801
01:09:21,840 --> 01:09:23,520
I wanted to see if you are okay.

802
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:25,880
I'm okay.

803
01:09:27,240 --> 01:09:29,080
Are you gonna stay?

804
01:09:30,680 --> 01:09:34,320
You and Henry can sleep on the couch.

805
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:47,800
Hello!

806
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:54,120
I'm late for school!
- Shit! I had an appointment at eight!

807
01:11:01,160 --> 01:11:03,160
Ready.
- Daddy...

808
01:11:12,120 --> 01:11:14,400
I'm mildly sedated, can you drive me?

809
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:16,880
No way! I gotta go to school!

810
01:11:20,200 --> 01:11:23,960
I'm going to get in trouble.
- I'll write you a note. - You?

811
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:26,200
How could you do it? I'm the father.

812
01:11:26,680 --> 01:11:28,960
Great, then start writing.
- Here.

813
01:11:30,680 --> 01:11:33,480
What should I write?
- Well, not the truth. I can't believe

814
01:11:33,960 --> 01:11:37,320
your drunk driving last night.
It's totally irresponsible.

815
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:40,920
You just see to it that Magdalena
gets to school on time. - Me?

816
01:11:41,360 --> 01:11:43,080
It's all your fault we're late.

817
01:11:43,520 --> 01:11:44,680
Don't fight!

818
01:11:45,160 --> 01:11:46,280
A high fever!

819
01:11:47,080 --> 01:11:50,080
Are you crazy?
I couldn't go to school like that!

820
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:52,960
Well, she's right.

821
01:11:53,960 --> 01:11:56,800
Say she was at the dentist's.
It's not even a lie. - That's good.

822
01:11:58,520 --> 01:11:59,480
That's good.

823
01:12:03,160 --> 01:12:04,200
We're there!

824
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:13,480
You redneck!

825
01:12:14,760 --> 01:12:16,680
Get in there now. Come on.

826
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:49,120
Thanks.

827
01:12:49,560 --> 01:12:52,280
If I can be of service to you,
don't hesitate to contact me.

828
01:12:52,760 --> 01:12:55,320
Why so formal?
- Call me anytime.

829
01:12:57,560 --> 01:13:00,720
How will you get home?
- Dunno. A taxi, I guess.

830
01:13:01,640 --> 01:13:02,760
I'll get that.

831
01:13:06,200 --> 01:13:08,720
Thanks.
- It'll be added to the bill.

832
01:13:13,480 --> 01:13:14,400
Taxi!

833
01:13:25,400 --> 01:13:29,440
You have one foot in the abyss.
- Why? - You are late again! Come!

834
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:31,880
Please.

835
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:35,360
Let's get started.
- Henry, we have a script to finish,

836
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:37,520
and you show up late

837
01:13:37,960 --> 01:13:40,680
because you screwed chicks all night?
- I did not!

838
01:13:41,160 --> 01:13:43,200
Was it good?
- Katharina!

839
01:13:57,960 --> 01:13:59,880
It's a bad time.
- Tristan, I need your help.

840
01:14:01,160 --> 01:14:03,320
What is it?
- Can you pick up Magdalena from school

841
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:05,240
and keep her tonight?

842
01:14:05,720 --> 01:14:08,240
Please, just for one night.
I'll pick her up tomorrow.

843
01:14:09,640 --> 01:14:12,040
Please! I'm really in ajam.

844
01:14:22,760 --> 01:14:23,560
Bye!

845
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:27,720
Where's Henry?

846
01:14:29,160 --> 01:14:30,840
I don't know. He's busy.

847
01:14:32,200 --> 01:14:33,200
You coming?

848
01:16:49,560 --> 01:16:52,200
Our script is great.
- Did you expect otherwise?

849
01:16:53,480 --> 01:16:54,320
No.

850
01:16:57,640 --> 01:17:00,640
Why didn't it work before?
- You never listen to anyone.

851
01:17:01,080 --> 01:17:04,280
That's bunk. - So why do you
have to write "Forest Ranger"

852
01:17:04,720 --> 01:17:07,840
even though you're a great writer?
- I like it.

853
01:17:08,280 --> 01:17:11,360
The "Forest Ranger"? Yeah, right.

854
01:17:11,800 --> 01:17:15,600
Have you ever even seen it?
- Yeah. Once. That was enough.

855
01:17:16,600 --> 01:17:20,160
Henry, you used to call that mainstream
crap. Nothing was good enough.

856
01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:26,080
Too mainstream, too arthouse, too smart,
too shallow, too this, too that.

857
01:17:26,520 --> 01:17:30,920
And you throw the best idea you ever had
in the trash. You know why? - Tell me.

858
01:17:31,360 --> 01:17:33,040
You never finish anything.

859
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:35,560
You finished?
- Yeah.

860
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:39,440
Why were you even with me
if I'm such an idiot?

861
01:17:42,600 --> 01:17:46,600
I loved to talk all night with you,
at least when you listened.

862
01:17:47,080 --> 01:17:48,920
I always felt safe with you,

863
01:17:49,400 --> 01:17:51,320
and I loved to laugh with you.

864
01:17:54,800 --> 01:18:00,200
Is that all? - And I always loved
to go shoe shopping with you.

865
01:18:00,920 --> 01:18:03,280
You're lying through your teeth.
- You're right.

866
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:24,920
Tristan...

867
01:18:26,440 --> 01:18:27,840
How are you?

868
01:18:28,280 --> 01:18:29,720
Not good.

869
01:18:30,760 --> 01:18:32,520
How's Magdalena?

870
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:34,560
Quite well, I think.

871
01:18:35,040 --> 01:18:35,960
I'm so sorry.

872
01:18:36,920 --> 01:18:38,360
Me, too.

873
01:18:39,240 --> 01:18:40,760
How's the trial going?

874
01:18:41,240 --> 01:18:44,120
I'm not sure. I think it's going well.

875
01:18:45,640 --> 01:18:47,320
There could be a settlement.

876
01:18:48,600 --> 01:18:50,160
That would be good.

877
01:18:51,720 --> 01:18:53,560
Can we talk again when I get back?

878
01:18:57,080 --> 01:18:58,400
I love you.

879
01:19:06,200 --> 01:19:07,600
How does the story end?

880
01:19:09,320 --> 01:19:11,480
What story?
- The story about the kid

881
01:19:11,920 --> 01:19:14,000
with the two fathers. What happens?

882
01:19:15,240 --> 01:19:16,440
Oh, that.

883
01:19:17,160 --> 01:19:18,200
Where were we?

884
01:19:19,320 --> 01:19:22,200
That the biological father
was totally overwhelmed.

885
01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:26,760
You remembered that?
- Of course. So what happens?

886
01:19:27,720 --> 01:19:32,160
The biological father is overwhelmed.
The last thing he ever wanted

887
01:19:32,600 --> 01:19:35,920
was to have a kid.
But then something happens:

888
01:19:37,560 --> 01:19:39,640
He starts to love the child.

889
01:19:41,320 --> 01:19:44,200
For the first time,
he feels a sense of responsibility.

890
01:19:44,680 --> 01:19:46,320
Nice. I like it.

891
01:19:49,240 --> 01:19:53,200
He looks back at his life
and realizes he's made lots of mistakes.

892
01:19:55,920 --> 01:19:59,080
Is there a woman in the story?
- Yes, there is.

893
01:19:59,520 --> 01:20:01,800
What happens with her?
- I don't know yet.

894
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:07,200
I have an idea,
but I don't know if it's going to work.

895
01:20:36,600 --> 01:20:37,560
It's funny...

896
01:20:38,600 --> 01:20:42,040
I knew you were the father,
and yet I'm truly shocked.

897
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:47,600
What do I do now?
- You're asking me?

898
01:20:48,080 --> 01:20:50,160
I don't know a thing about kids.

899
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:54,760
You have to tell her the truth.
- Me?

900
01:20:55,800 --> 01:20:58,760
Why don't you tell her?
- I can't do it either.

901
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:04,160
I mean, you got us into this mess,

902
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:06,840
it's only fair that you should tell her.

903
01:21:13,280 --> 01:21:15,640
Okay, I'll do it.
- Oh, God.

904
01:21:20,120 --> 01:21:22,920
Will you manage?
- I think so.

905
01:21:26,280 --> 01:21:27,920
You have to be gentle.

906
01:21:28,360 --> 01:21:30,040
I'm not an idiot.

907
01:21:46,840 --> 01:21:49,040
Magdalena,
you know where you come from, right?

908
01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:51,520
From Berlin.

909
01:21:52,600 --> 01:21:54,600
No, I mean before your birth.

910
01:21:55,480 --> 01:21:56,840
From Mommy's belly.

911
01:21:58,320 --> 01:22:02,360
And do you know how you got in there?
- What kind of a dumb question is that?

912
01:22:03,640 --> 01:22:05,280
What's dumb about it?

913
01:22:06,120 --> 01:22:08,760
Mommy and Daddy made love

914
01:22:09,240 --> 01:22:11,680
and Daddy's sperm had a race

915
01:22:12,120 --> 01:22:13,960
and the one that won was mine.

916
01:22:15,560 --> 01:22:18,760
Then it combined with Mommy's egg cell.
- Tell me,

917
01:22:19,240 --> 01:22:21,280
where did you learn all that?
- From the internet.

918
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:25,920
When I was your age,
I thought storks brought babies.

919
01:22:26,800 --> 01:22:28,960
There was no internet back then.

920
01:22:29,560 --> 01:22:30,520
That's true.

921
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,240
Why did you ask me that?

922
01:22:37,160 --> 01:22:39,000
Ask you what?
- Where I come from?

923
01:22:39,440 --> 01:22:40,480
No reason.

924
01:22:46,680 --> 01:22:50,760
If you were my dad, I would bug you
until you stopped smoking.

925
01:22:54,680 --> 01:22:56,640
Happy?
- Yes.

926
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:02,360
Hello?
- Well?

927
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:04,360
Well what?
- How'd she take it?

928
01:23:05,080 --> 01:23:08,960
She doesn't know yet. - You were going
to tell her! - I'm working on it!

929
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:11,760
You're working on it?
- You want to do it? - No, no.

930
01:23:12,200 --> 01:23:15,520
I don't know how to tell her.
- A fairy tale.

931
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,080
That's itl
- What about the truth?

932
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:22,600
Are you that stupid?
Present it as a fairy tale!

933
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:25,280
That's good.
- I know.

934
01:23:25,720 --> 01:23:27,880
That's really good.
- Yeah.

935
01:23:33,240 --> 01:23:36,760
Once upon a time
there was a knight named Henry

936
01:23:37,240 --> 01:23:39,440
charged by the king
to escort princess Charlotte

937
01:23:40,400 --> 01:23:44,840
to her betrothed, Tristan,
the king of Cornwall.

938
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:49,440
But on the way to Britain
they accidentally drank a love potion

939
01:23:49,880 --> 01:23:53,600
intended for Charlotte and Tristan.
They began to kiss,

940
01:23:54,080 --> 01:23:57,480
although they didn't love each other.
Because the potion was so strong,

941
01:23:57,920 --> 01:23:59,040
they made love.

942
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:02,360
Afterwards,
they felt horrible because Charlotte

943
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:05,280
was promised to Tristan,
and the noble knight Henry

944
01:24:05,720 --> 01:24:09,960
was with Katharina,
princess of Saxony-Anhalt.

945
01:24:10,440 --> 01:24:14,200
Nine months later, Charlotte gave birth
to a girl and named her Magda.

946
01:24:27,040 --> 01:24:27,800
Yes?

947
01:24:28,400 --> 01:24:31,120
What's going on here?
- Nothing, why?

948
01:24:33,960 --> 01:24:36,800
I thought of an ending.
- Ending for what?

949
01:24:37,920 --> 01:24:40,760
For your father story.
- Oh.

950
01:24:41,440 --> 01:24:45,040
Great. Can you tell me tomorrow?
- Tomorrow? You have wine? - No.

951
01:24:46,120 --> 01:24:49,520
What's up with you?
Can you let me in, please? - I can't...

952
01:24:52,080 --> 01:24:53,440
Why not?

953
01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:57,760
Are your two bunnies here?
- No, no one's here.

954
01:24:58,200 --> 01:25:01,200
I'm just incredibly tired
and I have to sleep and...

955
01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:08,800
Your toilet just flushed.

956
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:16,280
Like yours, just backwards.
First you flush, then you clap. - Right.

957
01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:22,800
What is it with today?
- Another date?

958
01:25:23,240 --> 01:25:26,360
I'm sure it's just the neighbor.
I'll get rid of him.

959
01:25:33,080 --> 01:25:34,120
Oh, shit.

960
01:25:37,200 --> 01:25:39,000
Henry, what the hell?

961
01:25:43,160 --> 01:25:45,080
What do you want?
- I have to talk to you.

962
01:25:45,520 --> 01:25:46,720
I can't right now.

963
01:25:47,160 --> 01:25:49,160
Open the damn door!
- Jehovah's Witnesses!

964
01:25:50,320 --> 01:25:52,960
Henry, open the door!
- Not interested!

965
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:57,440
I'm not selling anything,
I have to talk to you.

966
01:25:57,880 --> 01:25:59,840
Henry, open the damn door!

967
01:26:05,240 --> 01:26:08,040
Look what I found.
- She's got one already.

968
01:26:08,480 --> 01:26:10,560
No, it's the baby donkey.

969
01:26:11,040 --> 01:26:15,080
They belong together forever.
They're a family! - I'll give it to her.

970
01:26:16,120 --> 01:26:18,840
Let go of me!
- I have to talk to you. - Not now.

971
01:26:19,480 --> 01:26:22,040
There's been a change of plans.
- What do you mean?

972
01:26:23,160 --> 01:26:26,560
Charlotte doesn't want Magdalena
to know the truth. - Wait here.

973
01:26:29,240 --> 01:26:33,160
I'll get some cigarettes, okay?
- Magdalena, come. Henry...

974
01:26:33,800 --> 01:26:35,640
I'm not interested!

975
01:26:37,040 --> 01:26:38,400
What did Charlotte say?

976
01:26:43,280 --> 01:26:44,960
What are you doing here?

977
01:26:45,400 --> 01:26:46,160
Me?

978
01:26:46,920 --> 01:26:48,920
I came to visit Henry.

979
01:26:49,360 --> 01:26:50,640
You're pretty.

980
01:26:51,480 --> 01:26:52,440
Thank you.

981
01:26:52,880 --> 01:26:54,400
You are, too.

982
01:26:55,040 --> 01:26:58,080
Who are you?
- I live here at the moment.

983
01:27:04,080 --> 01:27:05,120
Have a seat.

984
01:27:09,640 --> 01:27:13,560
Who do you belong to? - I don't belong
to anyone. I'm not a car.

985
01:27:15,320 --> 01:27:17,120
Who are you?

986
01:27:17,560 --> 01:27:19,080
I'm a friend of Henry's.

987
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:20,760
What's your name?

988
01:27:21,720 --> 01:27:22,640
Katharina.

989
01:27:23,080 --> 01:27:25,600
Like the princess of Sexy Anthill.

990
01:27:27,360 --> 01:27:29,040
Oh God, no!

991
01:27:30,840 --> 01:27:32,640
How bloody stupid!

992
01:27:33,080 --> 01:27:36,720
Couldn't you have waited a day?
Charlotte's going to kill me.

993
01:27:37,200 --> 01:27:39,680
I was pretty subtle.
I told it like a fairy tale,

994
01:27:40,120 --> 01:27:44,200
just like you said. I don't think
she understood it. - Are you sure?

995
01:27:46,400 --> 01:27:49,280
Pretty sure.
- Let's hope for the best.

996
01:27:50,120 --> 01:27:54,160
I've got to go. I have to pick up
Charlotte at the airport in the morning.

997
01:27:55,240 --> 01:27:56,920
Why is she interfering anyway?

998
01:27:57,360 --> 01:28:01,520
First, she runs off to New York.
Now, she chimes in with great advice.

999
01:28:01,960 --> 01:28:04,200
Hey, she's not chiming in,

1000
01:28:05,400 --> 01:28:07,480
I asked her. She's Magdalena's mother,

1001
01:28:07,960 --> 01:28:11,600
in case you forgot.
And she didn't just run off,

1002
01:28:12,080 --> 01:28:15,920
she's in the midst of a difficult trial
that nearly got her jailed.

1003
01:28:16,400 --> 01:28:18,520
Calm down! I didn't mean it like that.

1004
01:28:27,440 --> 01:28:29,960
Why are you so sad?

1005
01:28:32,800 --> 01:28:34,400
I'm not sad.

1006
01:28:36,640 --> 01:28:37,600
Yes, you are.

1007
01:28:41,640 --> 01:28:46,040
That was a very nice story,
but I really have to go now.

1008
01:28:47,680 --> 01:28:49,840
The story's not true, is it?

1009
01:28:56,800 --> 01:28:58,760
It was nice to meet you.

1010
01:28:59,880 --> 01:29:00,680
Bye.

1011
01:29:04,800 --> 01:29:08,600
So, let me introduce you
to my little neighbor friend.

1012
01:29:11,400 --> 01:29:13,040
We already met.

1013
01:29:19,080 --> 01:29:20,600
Your daughter is very sweet.

1014
01:29:21,360 --> 01:29:22,680
Don't touch me!

1015
01:29:26,120 --> 01:29:29,000
Knight Henry, you're such a prick!

1016
01:29:32,880 --> 01:29:36,480
Your girlfriend went away again, huh?

1017
01:29:38,840 --> 01:29:42,200
Did you tell her the fairy tale?
- Yes.

1018
01:29:44,160 --> 01:29:47,360
Is that why she ran away?
- Yep.

1019
01:29:48,280 --> 01:29:52,000
I'm sorry.
- It's not your fault but all mine.

1020
01:29:52,440 --> 01:29:56,120
I'll go and try to talk with her, okay?
- Don't leave.

1021
01:29:56,560 --> 01:30:01,240
You want some ice cream?
- I want you to stay here.

1022
01:30:06,480 --> 01:30:08,080
You smell like smoke.

1023
01:30:08,560 --> 01:30:12,640
I like her a lot. If I don't talk to her,
she may never come back.

1024
01:30:13,080 --> 01:30:17,240
The knight story really happened,
didn't it?

1025
01:30:19,040 --> 01:30:22,600
Why did you have to drink
that stupid love potion?

1026
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:27,480
I really have to go.

1027
01:30:28,120 --> 01:30:29,080
Here.

1028
01:31:00,960 --> 01:31:03,120
No, don't open the door!

1029
01:31:03,560 --> 01:31:04,720
But Katharina...
- Maria.

1030
01:31:05,160 --> 01:31:07,360
I'll just open the door and go to bed.
- Just go.

1031
01:31:09,760 --> 01:31:11,280
Okay, good night.

1032
01:31:20,440 --> 01:31:21,640
Screw off!

1033
01:31:22,080 --> 01:31:23,520
Katharina, let me in!

1034
01:31:23,960 --> 01:31:25,360
Screw off, asshole!

1035
01:31:25,800 --> 01:31:27,760
Come on, open the door.
- Screw off!

1036
01:31:28,240 --> 01:31:30,800
Come on, let me in. Please!
- Screw off!

1037
01:31:35,320 --> 01:31:37,040
What the hell. Are you crazy?

1038
01:31:37,480 --> 01:31:40,200
What the hell?
Oh shit, you're bleeding.

1039
01:31:42,160 --> 01:31:44,200
Damn it! You are such an idiot.

1040
01:31:44,640 --> 01:31:46,800
You've seen too many movies.

1041
01:31:50,480 --> 01:31:53,640
Everything okay?
- Yes, Henry just had an accident.

1042
01:31:54,320 --> 01:31:57,400
Are you sure?
- Yes. Go back to bed.

1043
01:31:57,880 --> 01:32:02,520
Should I call a glazier?
- In the middle of the night? Go to bed.

1044
01:32:02,960 --> 01:32:04,480
Ambulance?
- Maria...

1045
01:32:10,120 --> 01:32:12,720
I want you to go now, please,

1046
01:32:13,160 --> 01:32:15,560
but this time through the door.
- Katharina, let's talk.

1047
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,600
Talk about what?
- Please, just five minutes.

1048
01:32:21,080 --> 01:32:22,560
Time's running.

1049
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,360
I'm waiting. You got three minutes left.

1050
01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:29,400
Katharina...
- Katharina?

1051
01:32:30,760 --> 01:32:32,600
Is that the best you can think of?

1052
01:32:33,040 --> 01:32:36,440
What did you think I'd do
when I found out you had a kid?

1053
01:32:37,720 --> 01:32:39,080
Commit suicide?

1054
01:32:43,320 --> 01:32:47,120
You impregnate someone while we're
together and don't even tell me.

1055
01:32:47,560 --> 01:32:52,120
I only just found out.
- You fed me this phony melodrama.

1056
01:32:52,560 --> 01:32:56,840
"Neighbor's daughter,
father has no cash for a babysitter..."

1057
01:32:58,280 --> 01:33:00,160
You're such a coward.

1058
01:33:03,440 --> 01:33:07,160
Do you know how much I wanted
children with you? - That's not fair.

1059
01:33:08,240 --> 01:33:11,040
I didn't know I had a child.
- Not fair?

1060
01:33:11,480 --> 01:33:15,600
"Not fair" is having unprotected sex
while you're together with me.

1061
01:33:16,040 --> 01:33:19,480
Ever heard of condoms?
- I didn't have one on me.

1062
01:33:24,120 --> 01:33:24,960
Go.

1063
01:33:26,280 --> 01:33:28,200
Go, I want to be alone.

1064
01:33:29,840 --> 01:33:31,160
I love you.

1065
01:33:32,720 --> 01:33:33,680
Go.

1066
01:34:16,840 --> 01:34:19,120
Hello?
- Why is Magdalena at your place?

1067
01:34:21,160 --> 01:34:23,680
She knows you're her father.
You left

1068
01:34:24,160 --> 01:34:27,560
although she asked you to stay.
She didn't want to be alone.

1069
01:34:29,880 --> 01:34:33,240
How is she?
- She's asleep now, but...

1070
01:34:34,880 --> 01:34:36,800
she had a thousand questions.

1071
01:34:38,920 --> 01:34:41,600
Did she cry?
- No, no...

1072
01:34:43,240 --> 01:34:45,120
but she asked me

1073
01:34:45,560 --> 01:34:47,600
if I was still her dad

1074
01:34:48,080 --> 01:34:50,960
and if there was an antidote
for the love potion.

1075
01:34:53,400 --> 01:34:55,240
What did you say?

1076
01:34:55,680 --> 01:34:57,200
That there isn't one.

1077
01:34:57,680 --> 01:34:59,920
I mean whether you're still her dad.

1078
01:35:01,280 --> 01:35:02,120
Oh.

1079
01:35:02,840 --> 01:35:04,880
I said yes. But I also said

1080
01:35:05,360 --> 01:35:07,360
that she now had two dads

1081
01:35:07,800 --> 01:35:11,560
and that that
was an especially cool thing.

1082
01:35:13,240 --> 01:35:15,960
I'll come get her now
so I can take her to school tomorrow.

1083
01:35:16,400 --> 01:35:18,440
No, Magdalena's asleep now.

1084
01:35:18,920 --> 01:35:21,560
Tomorrow morning
we'll go pick up her mom.

1085
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:23,720
Let's meet for lunch and talk then.

1086
01:35:29,400 --> 01:35:34,120
Hallo Henry, it's Katharina.
I'm just going to say this once,

1087
01:35:34,560 --> 01:35:39,520
I guess you know anyway.
We can't continue with the script.

1088
01:35:39,960 --> 01:35:44,040
I need to take a break and think about
what to do. I don't know.

1089
01:35:44,520 --> 01:35:48,880
You should really go see a doctor
so your hand doesn't get infected.

1090
01:36:09,400 --> 01:36:10,400
Hello.

1091
01:36:10,840 --> 01:36:13,000
Hi. How are you?

1092
01:36:13,680 --> 01:36:14,640
Terrible.

1093
01:36:15,840 --> 01:36:18,400
How'd it go at the airport.
- Good.

1094
01:36:20,320 --> 01:36:23,000
What happened to your hand?
- Nothing.

1095
01:36:23,440 --> 01:36:27,000
Henry, I had a long talk with Charlotte.

1096
01:36:27,960 --> 01:36:31,280
We want to give our marriage
another chance. Be a family.

1097
01:36:32,160 --> 01:36:34,920
That's great, I'm happy for you.

1098
01:36:36,960 --> 01:36:39,720
Well, there's a little problem.

1099
01:36:41,800 --> 01:36:46,040
Henry, Charlotte and I really appreciate
what you've done for us.

1100
01:36:46,680 --> 01:36:49,680
Not everyone would have,
and you have my utmost respect.

1101
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:53,560
What are you talking about?

1102
01:36:54,360 --> 01:36:59,800
That you took such good care
of Magdalena. - Took?

1103
01:37:01,760 --> 01:37:05,000
We want Magdalena to come home,
and I would be grateful...

1104
01:37:05,440 --> 01:37:07,000
Don't misunderstand me.

1105
01:37:07,440 --> 01:37:10,440
I like you, a lot even,
despite everything.

1106
01:37:10,920 --> 01:37:13,600
But I would be
grateful if you stayed out of my...

1107
01:37:14,040 --> 01:37:16,000
out of our lives.

1108
01:37:17,320 --> 01:37:18,400
Screw you.

1109
01:37:21,440 --> 01:37:23,640
You know why I'm in your life?

1110
01:37:24,120 --> 01:37:26,080
Because you didn't want Magdalena.

1111
01:37:26,560 --> 01:37:28,360
No, because you fucked my wife.

1112
01:37:28,840 --> 01:37:32,160
No, I'm in your life because Charlotte
left Magdalena at my door.

1113
01:37:32,600 --> 01:37:34,480
Because you didn't want her.

1114
01:37:34,920 --> 01:37:37,160
I couldn't take her,
because I was beside myself!

1115
01:37:38,920 --> 01:37:42,680
Can you imagine what it's like
to find out that your daughter

1116
01:37:43,160 --> 01:37:45,560
is not your child? But now I know

1117
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,560
that I can't live without her.
She's a part of me.

1118
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:51,440
I feel the same.
I can't live without her either.

1119
01:37:51,920 --> 01:37:54,000
You don't have to. She likes you.

1120
01:37:54,440 --> 01:37:56,280
We'll find a way.

1121
01:37:57,600 --> 01:37:59,800
She can visit you,
you can pick her up.

1122
01:38:00,240 --> 01:38:02,640
I don't have to be there.

1123
01:38:03,120 --> 01:38:05,760
Magdalena should decide
where she wants to live.

1124
01:38:06,200 --> 01:38:08,360
Magdalena can't decide that.
She's a child.

1125
01:38:10,240 --> 01:38:13,680
Magdalena wants to live with her mother,
and I'm her mother's partner.

1126
01:38:14,160 --> 01:38:15,640
I'm sorry.

1127
01:38:16,120 --> 01:38:20,400
There's just no place for you.
Try to fix things with your girlfriend.

1128
01:38:21,800 --> 01:38:23,360
She told me about it.

1129
01:38:23,840 --> 01:38:26,200
I hope it's not too bad. She told me

1130
01:38:26,680 --> 01:38:29,960
that she's pretty and really nice.
Excuse me.

1131
01:38:34,440 --> 01:38:35,560
Hi there, Sweetie.

1132
01:38:36,040 --> 01:38:38,840
Can we go swimming today?
- Swimming?

1133
01:38:39,280 --> 01:38:41,360
What about the dinosaurs at the museum?

1134
01:38:41,800 --> 01:38:45,800
Dinosaurs are for little kids.
I want to go swimming.

1135
01:38:46,240 --> 01:38:49,400
I don't have a swimsuit.
- We'll buy you one.

1136
01:38:49,880 --> 01:38:52,400
Okay, we'll buy one.
- I need a bikini.

1137
01:38:52,880 --> 01:38:54,520
How come? There's nothing...

1138
01:38:54,960 --> 01:38:57,000
An orange one with green spots.

1139
01:38:57,440 --> 01:39:00,200
Orange with green spots, got it.
- I love you.

1140
01:39:00,680 --> 01:39:03,360
I love you, too. Kiss kiss...

1141
01:41:11,040 --> 01:41:13,840
How could you screw up ajob like that?

1142
01:41:14,320 --> 01:41:16,640
You hit the jackpot.
I should really throw you out.

1143
01:41:17,600 --> 01:41:19,760
You got anything for me?
- No.

1144
01:41:20,200 --> 01:41:23,680
Give me something.
- I've got nothing. You know the game.

1145
01:41:24,160 --> 01:41:26,920
Nothing but reality TV.
- Then I can go.

1146
01:41:27,360 --> 01:41:29,200
Channel 5's got a new soap.

1147
01:41:29,680 --> 01:41:32,520
I know the producer. I can ask.
You need money?

1148
01:41:33,560 --> 01:41:36,600
380 Euros would be good.
I could really use the old beater.

1149
01:41:38,240 --> 01:41:40,640
The rest is for rent.
- Thanks.

1150
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,960
Did you know
that the whole project's dead?

1151
01:41:46,040 --> 01:41:49,400
She threw in the towel.
The film deal's history.

1152
01:42:33,120 --> 01:42:35,520
Mind if I sit down?

1153
01:42:35,960 --> 01:42:40,400
If you want to have a shitty time.
- You're a real charmer.

1154
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,360
I've been watching you from over there.

1155
01:42:45,440 --> 01:42:49,240
Why don't you go back
and watch some more? - Asshole!

1156
01:42:50,680 --> 01:42:51,720
Get lost.

1157
01:44:44,240 --> 01:44:45,960
I have to talk to you two.

1158
01:44:48,120 --> 01:44:50,920
It's important
that we agree on basic parenting issues

1159
01:44:51,400 --> 01:44:55,400
so she can't play you off against
each other. - I wouldn't do that, Mom.

1160
01:44:55,880 --> 01:44:59,440
Yes, Dear. Henry should be able
to see Magdalena as often as he wants.

1161
01:44:59,920 --> 01:45:02,560
Whenever he wants?
- Tomorrow, for instance.

1162
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:07,840
What do you think? - Awesome.
- But tomorrow we wanted to go shopping.

1163
01:45:08,680 --> 01:45:10,960
You work tomorrow.
- I'll take the day off.

1164
01:45:11,400 --> 01:45:15,160
You? - Yes, me.
- Then you all go together.

1165
01:45:15,600 --> 01:45:19,200
What is this, a tag team?
- Can I say something? - Sure.

1166
01:45:19,680 --> 01:45:22,040
We can just split the days.
- Proposal?

1167
01:45:22,920 --> 01:45:25,640
Tuesdays, Thursdays,
every other weekend. - No way.

1168
01:45:26,080 --> 01:45:28,960
I want Tuesdays. Wednesdays I work late.
- Okay.

1169
01:45:29,440 --> 01:45:31,800
Then Wednesdays, Fridays
and every other weekend.

1170
01:45:32,280 --> 01:45:36,720
Fridays we often travel over the weekend.
- You cant' just pick and choose!

1171
01:45:37,200 --> 01:45:39,480
Forget Fridays.
Take every fourth weekend.

1172
01:45:39,960 --> 01:45:42,160
Are you nuts?
- This is dumb!

1173
01:45:42,640 --> 01:45:45,840
What's dumb, Sweetie?
- The way they're fighting!

1174
01:45:46,320 --> 01:45:48,080
What do you want, Sweetie?

1175
01:45:48,560 --> 01:45:52,640
I just want them to stop fighting.
- We're not...

1176
01:45:54,080 --> 01:45:55,400
We're...
- I don't want...

1177
01:45:56,320 --> 01:45:59,560
We're not fighting, we're talking.
- Let her finish. - Sorry.

1178
01:46:00,920 --> 01:46:02,440
What did you want to say?

1179
01:46:04,400 --> 01:46:06,520
I love you both.

1180
01:46:07,280 --> 01:46:08,920
You hear that?

1181
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:14,280
Great, now I'll be stuck with him
for the rest of my life.

1182
01:46:15,320 --> 01:46:18,800
Nice work, you two.
- Tristan... - Sorry.

1183
01:46:27,640 --> 01:46:30,440
Organic mushrooms, yum.
- It's good for her.

1184
01:46:30,880 --> 01:46:33,440
We can go collect some in the woods.
- Yes, we can.

1185
01:46:33,960 --> 01:46:35,560
Put the damn mushrooms in the cart.

1186
01:46:38,840 --> 01:46:41,480
You trying to provoke me?
- Yeah. - Yeah? - Yeah!

1187
01:46:51,680 --> 01:46:54,520
Are you kidding?
What is all this stuff?

1188
01:46:54,960 --> 01:46:58,480
Chocolate is good for the soul.
- It's bad for your teeth.

1189
01:46:58,960 --> 01:47:01,440
Not if you always brush your teeth.

1190
01:47:01,880 --> 01:47:05,040
Henry gave me a ton of toothbrushes.

1191
01:47:05,480 --> 01:47:08,960
She brushes like a champion at my place.

1192
01:47:12,960 --> 01:47:14,160
Put it back.

1193
01:47:14,600 --> 01:47:18,200
Good God, let her have a few sweets.
- A few?

1194
01:47:21,960 --> 01:47:25,640
Alright, put the necklace back
and daddy will be happy.

1195
01:47:33,080 --> 01:47:34,880
You're trying to undermine my parenting.

1196
01:47:35,320 --> 01:47:37,640
You won't succeed.
- Just relax, man.

1197
01:47:38,080 --> 01:47:39,400
I'm relaxed.

1198
01:47:39,840 --> 01:47:42,360
I just want to ensure
that our daughter eats healthily.

1199
01:47:42,840 --> 01:47:46,560
Me, too. Look, organic milk.
From happy cows.

1200
01:47:56,600 --> 01:47:58,080
Samantha.

1201
01:47:59,600 --> 01:48:01,240
Samantha!

1202
01:48:02,280 --> 01:48:04,720
Samantha, can you give me a hand here?
- Huh?

1203
01:48:05,200 --> 01:48:07,480
It's not "huh," but "what"!

1204
01:48:08,240 --> 01:48:10,760
Why not scream louder, Mom?
How embarrassing!

1205
01:48:11,720 --> 01:48:12,560
Move it!

1206
01:48:24,720 --> 01:48:27,760
She likes these.
- Are you nuts? - Huh?

1207
01:48:28,200 --> 01:48:30,400
It's not "huh," but "what"!

1208
01:48:30,840 --> 01:48:33,600
It's not "what,"
but "I beg your pardon"!

1209
01:48:34,080 --> 01:48:36,040
They're unhealthy.
- Here, organic chips.

1210
01:48:37,040 --> 01:48:39,000
Put them back.
- We're buying them.

1211
01:48:39,480 --> 01:48:42,160
They're full of carcinogens.
- Says who? - I do.

1212
01:48:42,600 --> 01:48:44,840
I'm a doctor, remember?
- You're a dentist.

1213
01:48:45,720 --> 01:48:47,720
We'd like to check out now.

1214
01:49:00,480 --> 01:49:03,720
It was him. - They're my two dads.
They fight sometimes

1215
01:49:04,200 --> 01:49:06,840
but we'll straighten them out.

1216
01:49:11,600 --> 01:49:14,240
That's not it.
- Wanna bet?

1217
01:49:18,360 --> 01:49:19,760
I told you.

1218
01:49:29,400 --> 01:49:30,880
Hello?
- Henry?

1219
01:49:31,320 --> 01:49:32,440
Katharina...

1220
01:49:32,920 --> 01:49:34,240
I read your screenplay.

1221
01:49:35,840 --> 01:49:37,960
Henry, are you there?

1222
01:49:39,440 --> 01:49:42,160
What do you think?
- I'll tell you when you get here.

1223
01:49:42,600 --> 01:49:44,320
Where are you?
- In our bar.

1224
01:49:44,760 --> 01:49:46,240
I'm not alone.

1225
01:49:46,840 --> 01:49:48,480
Is your neighbor's daughter with you?

1226
01:49:49,160 --> 01:49:50,080
Yeah.

1227
01:49:51,320 --> 01:49:52,720
Then bring her along.

1228
01:49:55,080 --> 01:49:58,240
You want to go out with me?
- Anytime.

1229
01:50:09,680 --> 01:50:11,120
Hi there, you two.
- Hello.

1230
01:50:11,960 --> 01:50:14,760
What'll you have?
- Vodka tonic.

1231
01:50:15,200 --> 01:50:17,880
Vodka tonic?
- Just kidding. I'll have a coke.

1232
01:50:20,200 --> 01:50:23,960
Excuse me. A whisky for the gentleman
and a coke for his guest.

1233
01:50:26,680 --> 01:50:28,600
He stopped smoking.
- Really?

1234
01:50:29,840 --> 01:50:30,760
How come?

1235
01:50:31,200 --> 01:50:34,240
It's unhealthy, gives you cancer,
ages your skin, and you stink.

1236
01:50:37,840 --> 01:50:39,760
Now, as for your screenplay,

1237
01:50:40,200 --> 01:50:43,840
the first twenty pages
would put people to sleep.

1238
01:50:44,320 --> 01:50:47,640
What do you propose?
- Nix it.

1239
01:50:48,080 --> 01:50:50,920
Are you crazy?
They're absolutely essential.

1240
01:50:51,360 --> 01:50:53,600
You want people sleep,
leave in, yes?

1241
01:50:55,120 --> 01:50:56,760
I'll think about it.

1242
01:50:57,680 --> 01:51:00,280
Anything else?
- The names are ridiculous.

1243
01:51:01,160 --> 01:51:04,920
Why?
- Why? Harry, Karin, Manuela...

1244
01:51:06,480 --> 01:51:10,280
They're just names. I can change them.
- You should.

1245
01:51:10,720 --> 01:51:12,720
Was there anything you liked?
- The rest.

1246
01:51:13,640 --> 01:51:16,080
The rest is awesome.
Especially the end,

1247
01:51:16,520 --> 01:51:21,320
when Harry marries Karin, they have
four kids and live happily ever after.

1248
01:51:22,240 --> 01:51:24,960
Do you think it could work in real life?

1249
01:51:27,560 --> 01:51:28,680
I do.

1250
01:51:29,840 --> 01:51:31,400
You do?
- I do.

1251
01:51:31,840 --> 01:51:36,120
But the average life expectancy
for a man is 76, and you're 42.

1252
01:51:36,600 --> 01:51:39,200
So? I've still got 36 years.
- No, 34.

1253
01:51:39,680 --> 01:51:43,200
Huh?
- 76 minus 42 is 34.

1254
01:51:43,840 --> 01:51:46,600
See? That's why I always say
how important it is

1255
01:51:47,080 --> 01:51:48,800
to do your math.
- Silly.

1256
01:51:49,800 --> 01:51:51,880
Can we finally just finish our script?

1257
01:51:52,320 --> 01:51:54,360
There's nothing I'd rather do.

1258
01:51:56,240 --> 01:51:57,800
Go ahead and kiss already!
