1
00:00:32,045 --> 00:00:34,445
Ah. that wasn't so bad!

2
00:01:21,294 --> 00:01:22,693
- Here I am...

3
00:01:24,097 --> 00:01:25,291
Paradise.

4
00:01:26,633 --> 00:01:28,225
I've got everything I want.

5
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:36,200
But it doesn't add up to shit.

6
00:01:36,343 --> 00:01:39,642
'Cause I fell in love
with the wrong man.

7
00:01:43,617 --> 00:01:45,414
Be careful who you love.

8
00:02:05,472 --> 00:02:07,531
- First thing I'm doing
when I get home.

9
00:02:07,674 --> 00:02:11,770
I'm gonna rub some cat food
just on my cheeks like that.

10
00:02:11,912 --> 00:02:14,506
Let all the kitties come up
and lick it off me.

11
00:02:15,482 --> 00:02:17,040
There's no better feeling

12
00:02:17,184 --> 00:02:20,415
than a little miniature
sandpaper-tongue kitty.

13
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:26,291
Well. they let everybody out.
you know. in two shifts.

14
00:02:26,426 --> 00:02:29,088
There's a morning parole
and an afternoon parole.

15
00:02:29,229 --> 00:02:32,255
I got morning parole. Thank God...

16
00:02:32,399 --> 00:02:35,266
Ricky and Julian are getting out
this afternoon. hopefully.

17
00:02:35,402 --> 00:02:37,131
if everything goes right.

18
00:02:42,709 --> 00:02:45,041
- Hi. My name's Julian.

19
00:02:45,178 --> 00:02:48,511
Inmate number 212457.
Thank you for your time today.

20
00:02:48,648 --> 00:02:50,206
- Have a seat.

21
00:02:51,918 --> 00:02:54,478
- Name and prisoner number please?
- You know who I fucking am.

22
00:02:54,621 --> 00:02:56,384
And here's my goddamn number
right here.

23
00:02:56,523 --> 00:02:59,083
Just read what they say right on me.
right here!

24
00:02:59,226 --> 00:03:01,285
- Well. Ricky. we've been--

25
00:03:01,428 --> 00:03:03,157
- Can you smoke in here?

26
00:03:04,865 --> 00:03:07,595
- This here's a certificate
for an auto body technician.

27
00:03:07,734 --> 00:03:10,259
It's a course that I took in jail.
- Good!

28
00:03:10,403 --> 00:03:11,631
Let's get the fuck going here.

29
00:03:11,771 --> 00:03:13,432
get on with this and get me out.

30
00:03:13,573 --> 00:03:15,438
'Cause I know
you're gonna let me out anyway.

31
00:03:15,575 --> 00:03:17,975
It's 40 grand a year minimum
to fucking keep me here.

32
00:03:18,111 --> 00:03:20,136
I've seen that on TV in jail.

33
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,680
It's overcrowded.
I didn't even do anything that bad.

34
00:03:22,816 --> 00:03:25,478
- Okay. sir. What I've put together
is a four-year plan

35
00:03:25,619 --> 00:03:28,486
for a business that I wanna open.
it's called Success Auto Body.

36
00:03:28,622 --> 00:03:29,850
- Yep.

37
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:34,484
- And I plan on opening up the business
in my trailer.

38
00:03:34,628 --> 00:03:36,619
that was given to me
by my grandmother...

39
00:03:38,598 --> 00:03:40,532
... and turn it into an auto body shop.

40
00:03:40,667 --> 00:03:43,795
- I didn't get any diploma yet.
but I'm gonna be getting the grade 12.

41
00:03:43,937 --> 00:03:46,599
Once you have that.
you can pretty much do anything.

42
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:48,469
- Myself. I've learned my lesson.

43
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:51,475
And the only way to succeed in life
is to be legitimate.

44
00:03:51,611 --> 00:03:53,306
and to stay away from crime.

45
00:03:53,446 --> 00:03:57,348
- Your friend Julian has convinced us
that he will be a success...

46
00:03:57,484 --> 00:03:59,509
- All right.
- ... in his business.

47
00:03:59,653 --> 00:04:02,315
- Well. I'm gonna work for him.
so that makes me a success. so--

48
00:04:02,455 --> 00:04:05,322
- It doesn't automatically.
It's a long road to success. sir.

49
00:04:06,192 --> 00:04:08,660
- Sir. it's gonna be 100% legitimate.

50
00:04:08,795 --> 00:04:10,695
I will be a taxpayer as of today

51
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:12,559
if you grant me with this release.

52
00:04:12,699 --> 00:04:14,792
- There's no chance you might find
a way to. say.

53
00:04:14,935 --> 00:04:16,698
chop a few cars in your spare time?

54
00:04:16,836 --> 00:04:18,167
- No. sir.

55
00:04:18,305 --> 00:04:20,273
- What's the right answer here. guys?

56
00:04:20,407 --> 00:04:22,875
I'm gonna go get a job
or go fucking grow some dope

57
00:04:23,009 --> 00:04:25,569
and sell a bit of dope
and support my family that way--

58
00:04:25,712 --> 00:04:26,974
- Excuse me?

59
00:04:27,113 --> 00:04:29,274
- I can tell you whatever
you wanna hear or be honest.

60
00:04:29,416 --> 00:04:30,974
I'll grow dope.
that's what I'm good at.

61
00:04:31,117 --> 00:04:33,142
I grow the best dope of anyone
I've ever met.

62
00:04:33,286 --> 00:04:35,345
- I've been looking through
these papers here

63
00:04:35,488 --> 00:04:37,956
and it mentions
a fellow named Jim Lahey.

64
00:04:38,091 --> 00:04:39,581
Trailer Park superintendent.

65
00:04:39,726 --> 00:04:44,356
Uh. there seems to be
some ongoing problems with...

66
00:04:44,497 --> 00:04:46,488
you and him.

67
00:04:46,633 --> 00:04:49,158
Is this going to continue
when you come out of prison?

68
00:04:49,302 --> 00:04:50,428
- No. absolutely not.

69
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:52,970
- Can I have a cigarette then?
- Take him back to his seat!

70
00:04:53,106 --> 00:04:55,472
- Why don't you ask Darren
how high he is?

71
00:04:55,609 --> 00:04:58,669
Just one drag! Fuck off and let me
have a cigarette!

72
00:04:58,812 --> 00:05:01,713
- Give those back!
- You left them out to tease me!

73
00:05:01,848 --> 00:05:03,645
- Come on!
- Just one little drag...

74
00:05:03,783 --> 00:05:06,581
- I'm never gonna give up on success.

75
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,154
That is the only thing that's on my mind
right now.

76
00:05:09,289 --> 00:05:12,486
I'm never coming back to jail.
And I'm going to be successful.

77
00:05:12,626 --> 00:05:14,389
- Let's make sure
we don't see you here again.

78
00:05:19,265 --> 00:05:21,130
- Well. I came in on the bus.
you know.

79
00:05:21,267 --> 00:05:23,132
with this vision of Sunnyvale
in my head.

80
00:05:23,269 --> 00:05:24,736
and I get off the bus

81
00:05:24,871 --> 00:05:27,362
and I'm fucking stunned!

82
00:05:27,507 --> 00:05:29,839
I mean. it's demolished.
the trailers are down...

83
00:05:29,976 --> 00:05:33,002
the grass is growing up.
garbage everywhere.

84
00:05:33,146 --> 00:05:34,909
Fucking dogs eating out

85
00:05:35,048 --> 00:05:38,074
of old garbage bags and lickin' things.

86
00:05:38,218 --> 00:05:40,345
This is disastrous!

87
00:05:40,487 --> 00:05:42,978
So I immediately. you know.
I wanted to go to my shed.

88
00:05:43,123 --> 00:05:45,921
and check on that
and check on my kitties...

89
00:05:48,595 --> 00:05:50,495
Not even a fucking nibble!

90
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,261
I'd constructed a food mountain
in there for them.

91
00:05:56,403 --> 00:05:59,463
and left water for them.
and the fucking thing's barely touched.

92
00:05:59,606 --> 00:06:01,301
'cause someone boarded up
the cat door.

93
00:06:01,441 --> 00:06:02,874
Cocksucker!

94
00:06:03,777 --> 00:06:06,268
It's just not right.
It's really eerie here.

95
00:06:06,946 --> 00:06:09,005
Something's fucky.

96
00:06:15,455 --> 00:06:17,753
- Boys. stay in a single file
as you're leaving.

97
00:06:17,891 --> 00:06:20,792
Step on the bus and make your way
to the back.

98
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:24,488
Hope you enjoyed your stay.
Don't come back.

99
00:06:25,265 --> 00:06:27,290
You boys stay out of trouble.

100
00:06:46,219 --> 00:06:47,584
- Hey. boys!

101
00:06:47,721 --> 00:06:49,689
Did you guys get
what I was talking about?

102
00:06:49,823 --> 00:06:50,949
Good work.

103
00:06:51,091 --> 00:06:53,423
- Please tell me you got
a bit of smoke or something.

104
00:06:56,463 --> 00:06:58,328
- Check to see if the door's unlocked.

105
00:06:58,465 --> 00:06:59,796
- Fuck that!

106
00:07:01,468 --> 00:07:03,402
- You idiot!
Do you want those guys to hear us?

107
00:07:03,536 --> 00:07:07,131
- They're deafer than two deaf donkeys.
Come on. just get in.

108
00:07:10,844 --> 00:07:13,210
- Pull up your pants!
Pull up your pants. Ricky!

109
00:07:13,346 --> 00:07:14,643
- It's the fucking track pants!

110
00:07:14,781 --> 00:07:16,976
- Come on. baby. come on!
- Quick. quick. quick!

111
00:07:17,117 --> 00:07:18,982
- Okay. we're good.
- Go. go. go!

112
00:07:23,857 --> 00:07:25,848
- Boys. back off! I'm serious!
Don't blow this!

113
00:07:25,992 --> 00:07:28,290
Come on. just back off!

114
00:07:28,428 --> 00:07:29,622
- Julian. I'm telling you.

115
00:07:29,763 --> 00:07:31,128
Happens every time
with this dovametry crew.

116
00:07:31,264 --> 00:07:33,289
They fucking get too close
and they screw everything up.

117
00:07:33,433 --> 00:07:35,298
- Just shut up and put your box on.
- Yeah.

118
00:07:35,435 --> 00:07:36,561
- You ready?

119
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:41,333
- Why do I get a box
and you get a cool welding mask?

120
00:07:41,474 --> 00:07:43,942
- 'Cause I'm in charge.
Everything's cool. man.

121
00:07:44,077 --> 00:07:48,446
- Guys. I'm serious. you gotta back off.
you're gonna fuck this up.

122
00:07:48,581 --> 00:07:50,276
Get out of here. I'm serious.

123
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:52,441
- Smarten up. Get over here!

124
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:05,760
- Good afternoon. everyone!
My name is Bobby Boxhead.

125
00:08:05,899 --> 00:08:07,526
This is not a robbery.

126
00:08:07,667 --> 00:08:10,727
We're taking some money for charity
and some liquor. no big deal.

127
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:13,395
Everyone relax. This is not a robbery.
This is for charity.

128
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:15,974
This is my partner. Weldy Weldyface.

129
00:08:16,109 --> 00:08:19,044
He will take all of your donations.
Everyone just relax.

130
00:08:19,179 --> 00:08:22,080
- Let's have some drinks. here.
Just like my partner Weldy Weldy.

131
00:08:23,483 --> 00:08:26,646
Now. what the fuck do we have here?
You're not leaving the store!

132
00:08:26,786 --> 00:08:28,185
Get on the fucking ground!

133
00:08:28,321 --> 00:08:31,813
Now. this is a fucking robbery
'cause of these orange fuck fuckies!

134
00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:33,186
Weldy. go clean out the till.

135
00:08:33,326 --> 00:08:35,692
because of these guys right here.
this is now a robbery.

136
00:08:35,829 --> 00:08:38,627
- Sorry folks.
the hunters fucked this up.

137
00:08:38,765 --> 00:08:40,164
I apologize.

138
00:08:40,433 --> 00:08:42,901
- You guys did fuck this up
for the charity. Now get up!

139
00:08:43,036 --> 00:08:45,971
- Yeah. I'm getting' up.
- Get up! Get up and get the fuck out!

140
00:08:46,105 --> 00:08:48,164
Go shoot your goddamn bunnies
and your fucking gophers.

141
00:08:48,308 --> 00:08:50,799
Ah... okay. We're good.
We're good here.

142
00:08:50,944 --> 00:08:52,605
- All right. Thanks a lot.

143
00:08:52,745 --> 00:08:54,940
- Good job. everyone! Great robbery!

144
00:08:55,081 --> 00:08:58,312
All right. now get this loaded
and stop fucking around!

145
00:09:01,254 --> 00:09:02,551
- Later. fuck fucks!

146
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:05,915
- Here. kitty. kitty. kitty. come kitty!

147
00:09:06,759 --> 00:09:08,090
Psst! Psst! Psst!

148
00:09:09,863 --> 00:09:12,058
Here. kitty. kitty. kitty!
Come kitty! Come kitty!

149
00:09:12,198 --> 00:09:14,166
Kitty come! Kitty come!

150
00:09:15,969 --> 00:09:17,630
Kitties...?

151
00:09:18,571 --> 00:09:20,539
Where the fuck are you guys?

152
00:09:28,581 --> 00:09:30,708
Phil Collins...
- Just keep at it.

153
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:33,080
- Come on.
- I don't know. boy. I don't know.

154
00:09:33,219 --> 00:09:35,050
Thank God you're patient.

155
00:09:45,164 --> 00:09:47,894
- Phil. Jacob?
- Hey. Bubbles!

156
00:09:48,034 --> 00:09:51,629
- What's going on?
- Go ask Lahey. at the new park.

157
00:09:52,739 --> 00:09:53,933
Ah. fuck!

158
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:57,676
- New park?
- Ah...

159
00:09:58,578 --> 00:10:01,809
- Luxury estates is a testament
to inspiration

160
00:10:01,948 --> 00:10:03,506
and a lot of work.

161
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:07,609
You know. when Ricky went back to jail.
it was like I was reborn.

162
00:10:08,187 --> 00:10:09,848
Got off the hard liquor...

163
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:11,889
dropped 15 pounds.

164
00:10:12,025 --> 00:10:13,890
got back to business.

165
00:10:14,027 --> 00:10:18,760
I discovered that Barb's deed
to Sunnyvale included 50 acres

166
00:10:18,898 --> 00:10:20,627
of prime development land.

167
00:10:20,767 --> 00:10:23,759
I made a sweet deal with her:
sold off half.

168
00:10:23,903 --> 00:10:25,894
and built this beautiful park.

169
00:10:28,207 --> 00:10:31,142
- God. Randy! Watch the dust!
- Jeez. wingnut!

170
00:10:31,277 --> 00:10:34,144
- Randy. when are we getting
our septics?!

171
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:37,044
- Yeah. come on!
- Two weeks. Randy!

172
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:41,483
- Made one critical mistake:
I put Randy in charge of the new sewer.

173
00:10:41,621 --> 00:10:43,486
He called the Department
of Environment.

174
00:10:43,623 --> 00:10:45,887
Now. we have to follow
the old sewer line

175
00:10:46,025 --> 00:10:48,152
which runs right under
Julian's property.

176
00:10:48,294 --> 00:10:50,626
Randy fucked up and I have to fix it.

177
00:10:50,763 --> 00:10:51,889
Again.

178
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:55,831
I walk along the street

179
00:10:55,969 --> 00:10:57,664
We used to walk

180
00:10:57,804 --> 00:11:00,432
Two by two lovers pass

181
00:11:01,774 --> 00:11:05,676
And as they're passing by

182
00:11:05,812 --> 00:11:07,905
I could die

183
00:11:08,047 --> 00:11:09,912
'Cause you're not here with me

184
00:11:10,049 --> 00:11:11,175
- Come in!

185
00:11:13,653 --> 00:11:17,145
- Mr. Lahey? Randy?

186
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:18,951
- Bubbles!
- Hey. Bubbles!

187
00:11:19,092 --> 00:11:21,652
- Hey. how do you like the new park?

188
00:11:21,794 --> 00:11:23,853
- My cats. Mr. Lahey. where are they?

189
00:11:23,997 --> 00:11:26,625
- Bubbles. I have no idea
where your cats are.

190
00:11:26,766 --> 00:11:28,859
- Right? You have no idea
what happened to my kitties?

191
00:11:29,002 --> 00:11:30,970
- Calm down. Bubbles.
- Get your hands off me. Randy.

192
00:11:31,104 --> 00:11:33,937
- You gotta calm down. okay?
- Don't fucking touch me.

193
00:11:34,073 --> 00:11:36,633
- Listen. Bubbles.
- Don't make me throw you out. Bubbles.

194
00:11:36,776 --> 00:11:38,300
- There was a lot of people complaining.
- Yeah?

195
00:11:38,444 --> 00:11:40,173
- Yeah.
- Why did you board up the kitty door?

196
00:11:40,313 --> 00:11:42,178
- Listen. I think Animal Control
took them away. Bubbles.

197
00:11:42,315 --> 00:11:46,149
- Animal Control?
What do you mean. Animal Control?

198
00:11:46,285 --> 00:11:48,776
- Calm down!

199
00:11:50,957 --> 00:11:52,925
- Here. Randy! Want some fly paper?

200
00:11:53,059 --> 00:11:55,619
Snack on that. Randy!
- I'll put you down. I swear!

201
00:11:55,762 --> 00:11:57,024
- Bubbles...
- Let me go. Randy!

202
00:11:57,163 --> 00:12:00,098
- Bubbles. you will calm down
or I'll have to call the...

203
00:12:02,101 --> 00:12:04,592
- Bubbles. that's it. I'm pinning you.
- Get off me. Randy!

204
00:12:04,737 --> 00:12:06,136
- You need to calm down!
- Lahey!

205
00:12:06,272 --> 00:12:09,708
Get those clippers away from me!

206
00:12:11,444 --> 00:12:13,002
The clippers are touching me!

207
00:12:13,146 --> 00:12:14,545
Get them away from me!

208
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,113
I think it's caught in my hair.

209
00:12:16,249 --> 00:12:18,877
- Just wait.
- Oh. my God... Don't tug it.

210
00:12:19,018 --> 00:12:20,815
- Don't move.
- It hurts!

211
00:12:21,788 --> 00:12:24,450
- Bubs? I'm gonna have to turn it on.
- Don't turn it on!

212
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:27,081
- I'll have to turn it on
to get it out. Bubs.

213
00:12:27,226 --> 00:12:28,784
Just relax. it won't hurt.

214
00:12:30,329 --> 00:12:31,762
- Lahey!

215
00:12:31,798 --> 00:12:34,323
What did you do?

216
00:12:35,201 --> 00:12:36,668
- Nothing. Bubs. It looks great.
- It's okay.

217
00:12:36,803 --> 00:12:38,964
- What did you do?
- Didn't cut you a bit. Bubs.

218
00:12:39,105 --> 00:12:41,073
- What the fuck did you do?!
- It's perfect.

219
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:47,143
Look. there's no need to crack
the shit crust over this.

220
00:12:49,682 --> 00:12:51,411
- You fucked up my hair!

221
00:12:51,551 --> 00:12:54,611
- Bubs. it's not that bad!
I was an accident.

222
00:12:55,321 --> 00:12:56,481
- Yeah?

223
00:12:57,490 --> 00:13:01,256
You just wait. fucky!
You wait till Ricky and Julian see this.

224
00:13:01,828 --> 00:13:03,989
- Bubbles... it wasn't our fault.

225
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:05,757
It was an accident.

226
00:13:05,898 --> 00:13:07,798
- Oh. it was an accident. was it?

227
00:13:14,974 --> 00:13:16,498
That was an accident. too.

228
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:21,506
I'm as blue as I can be

229
00:13:21,647 --> 00:13:23,046
Blue on blue

230
00:13:23,182 --> 00:13:24,615
Cocksuckers...

231
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:26,217
Heartache on heartache

232
00:13:26,352 --> 00:13:28,820
Blue on blue

233
00:13:28,955 --> 00:13:30,820
Now that we are through

234
00:13:30,957 --> 00:13:32,083
Fuck...

235
00:13:32,225 --> 00:13:33,920
Blue on blue

236
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:36,028
Heartache on heartache

237
00:13:37,263 --> 00:13:42,064
And I find I can't get over
losing you

238
00:13:53,045 --> 00:13:55,309
- Hello...?

239
00:13:56,482 --> 00:13:58,177
- Hello.
- Hi. there.

240
00:13:58,317 --> 00:13:59,716
- What's going on here?

241
00:13:59,852 --> 00:14:02,047
- Ah. these guys are following me
around all the time.

242
00:14:02,188 --> 00:14:04,281
Don't worry about them.
My name's Bubbles.

243
00:14:04,423 --> 00:14:08,359
I'm from Sunnyvale Trailer Park.
I think you have some of my kitties.

244
00:14:08,494 --> 00:14:11,019
- Sunnyvale? Right.
Could you please take a seat?

245
00:14:11,164 --> 00:14:12,756
- Certainly.
- Jenny?

246
00:14:12,899 --> 00:14:14,059
- Yeah?

247
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:17,727
- The gentleman from the trailer park
is here. Could I see those files?

248
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:19,667
- Just a sec.
- Files?

249
00:14:19,805 --> 00:14:21,796
You have files on my kitties?

250
00:14:26,212 --> 00:14:27,702
- Hi.

251
00:14:32,051 --> 00:14:36,920
- Right. So we had a few phone calls.
Very agitated phone calls from...

252
00:14:37,056 --> 00:14:39,889
Mr. Lahey was concerned
about the welfare of your animals.

253
00:14:40,026 --> 00:14:42,688
- They were probably drunk calls
more than agitated.

254
00:14:42,828 --> 00:14:46,229
- Well... I think concern was making him
a little incoherent.

255
00:14:46,365 --> 00:14:49,801
We collected 27 cats.
Now. of those. 21 had to be spayed

256
00:14:49,936 --> 00:14:52,427
or neutered.
they were all full of fleas.

257
00:14:52,572 --> 00:14:55,564
They all had to be needled.
They were in very poor condition.

258
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:57,232
They were showing signs
of malnutrition.

259
00:14:57,376 --> 00:14:59,310
We don't condone neglect.

260
00:14:59,445 --> 00:15:02,972
- She started giving me the gears
that I don't take care of my kitties.

261
00:15:03,115 --> 00:15:05,879
and this and that.
and I tried to explain to her:

262
00:15:06,018 --> 00:15:08,782
Look. I had it figured out.
I built a food mountain.

263
00:15:08,921 --> 00:15:11,082
And calculated how much time
I'd be away

264
00:15:11,224 --> 00:15:14,159
and it was all gonna work.
but Mr. Lahey fucked it up!

265
00:15:15,861 --> 00:15:17,351
Point being...

266
00:15:17,496 --> 00:15:19,396
that makes me a neglector.

267
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:24,064
I know. you're right.
Can I just get them?

268
00:15:24,203 --> 00:15:25,864
I'll take them right now.

269
00:15:26,005 --> 00:15:28,235
- No. I'm afraid not.

270
00:15:28,374 --> 00:15:31,537
$127 a cat times 27. you come up
with that and you can have your cats.

271
00:15:33,112 --> 00:15:35,876
Oh. Jenn?
Could you do a run-up to Horton's?

272
00:15:36,015 --> 00:15:37,710
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

273
00:15:42,855 --> 00:15:44,083
- Hey!

274
00:15:45,224 --> 00:15:47,215
Come in after hours to see your cats.

275
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:05,843
- Julian!

276
00:16:06,412 --> 00:16:10,075
- Oh. fuck!
- Where's Ricky? He didn't get out?

277
00:16:10,216 --> 00:16:14,482
- Oh. no. He got out.
I didn't think it'd be this bad!

278
00:16:16,088 --> 00:16:17,953
What the fuck is Ricky doin'?

279
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:20,081
Look. don't tell him Randy and Lahey
shaved your head.

280
00:16:20,226 --> 00:16:23,195
He'll fucking freak out and attack them.
That's the last thing we need right now.

281
00:16:23,329 --> 00:16:25,024
- That's the last of my worries anyway.

282
00:16:25,164 --> 00:16:28,725
120 bucks per cat!
I don't have that kind of money.

283
00:16:28,868 --> 00:16:32,065
- We'll figure that out. okay?
- Why are we at the dump?

284
00:16:32,204 --> 00:16:34,434
And why's he hidin'?

285
00:16:34,573 --> 00:16:36,564
- Man. you scared the fuck out of me.

286
00:16:36,709 --> 00:16:38,768
I thought you were the cops.
- What are you doing?

287
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:41,379
I told you to cover that up.
I can still see it.

288
00:16:41,514 --> 00:16:42,845
- It's almost done.
- Department of Corrections?

289
00:16:42,982 --> 00:16:44,540
What the fuck is that!?

290
00:16:44,684 --> 00:16:48,142
- We had to steal it to rob the liquor
store to get some start-up money.

291
00:16:48,287 --> 00:16:50,448
- Oh. my goodness...
- Don't worry about it. Smooth as piss.

292
00:16:50,589 --> 00:16:52,853
Where did you get the fucking dope
Monte Carlo. man!

293
00:16:52,992 --> 00:16:54,357
It's awesome. Fucking SS.

294
00:16:54,493 --> 00:16:56,484
- It's the company car.
Paid four grand for it. bud.

295
00:16:58,397 --> 00:17:00,922
- How much money's left?
- Nothing.

296
00:17:01,067 --> 00:17:03,695
Well. I had to buy tools.
I had to get the garage door.

297
00:17:03,836 --> 00:17:05,929
which is going to go on tomorrow.
start-up costs.

298
00:17:06,072 --> 00:17:07,505
- You spent all the fucking money.

299
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,540
- Well. you gotta spend money
to make money.

300
00:17:09,675 --> 00:17:11,267
that's the way business works. okay?

301
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:12,877
- Actually. no. it's not.

302
00:17:13,012 --> 00:17:14,946
You keep your money.
then you have your money.

303
00:17:15,081 --> 00:17:16,412
That's how you fucking make money.

304
00:17:16,549 --> 00:17:19,040
And who the fuck made you in charge
of our money?

305
00:17:19,185 --> 00:17:21,176
- Who came up with the four-year
business plan? Me.

306
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:24,517
- Oh. success. Yeah.
Guess what? I don't even get success.

307
00:17:27,727 --> 00:17:30,287
- Can everybody just stop fighting?
- Listen... Look.

308
00:17:30,429 --> 00:17:32,192
Since you don't even understand
what I'm saying here.

309
00:17:32,331 --> 00:17:34,128
why don't I show you. get in the car.

310
00:17:34,266 --> 00:17:37,258
- Is that one of those fucking
Hostess Munchies hats?

311
00:17:37,403 --> 00:17:39,098
- Yes.
- It's awesome.

312
00:17:39,238 --> 00:17:41,103
- Give it back. Give it--

313
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,333
- What in the fuck happened
to your head!

314
00:17:43,476 --> 00:17:45,307
- I was... messin' around.
- Oh. my God...

315
00:17:45,444 --> 00:17:48,436
- He got drunk and high
and tried to cut his hair.

316
00:17:48,581 --> 00:17:50,014
He fucked up.

317
00:17:50,149 --> 00:17:52,481
- You did that yourself?.
My God. did you ever fuck it up!

318
00:17:52,618 --> 00:17:54,483
- No. I know.
- That sucks. man.

319
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:57,555
- Yeah. it sucks. It sucks moose balls.
And I did it.

320
00:17:57,690 --> 00:17:59,055
Give me my fucking thing.

321
00:18:02,762 --> 00:18:05,390
- Oh. look! It's Shitwinkle and Cocky.

322
00:18:05,531 --> 00:18:07,396
- What the fuck are those idiots doing?

323
00:18:07,533 --> 00:18:09,160
- So much is riding on this.

324
00:18:09,301 --> 00:18:13,237
We have all the tenants in the new park.
who have no sewer.

325
00:18:13,372 --> 00:18:17,069
And we have to put the sewer line
through Julian's property.

326
00:18:17,209 --> 00:18:19,973
And I am confident.
I have every hope

327
00:18:20,112 --> 00:18:21,875
that Julian's gonna see the light.

328
00:18:22,014 --> 00:18:24,380
and he's gonna accept my offer.
and be reasonable.

329
00:18:24,517 --> 00:18:26,951
Julian... I gotta talk to you
about something really important.

330
00:18:27,086 --> 00:18:30,578
Because if he doesn't.
I'm up shit creek.

331
00:18:30,723 --> 00:18:33,954
Take a look at this trailer.
You haven't seen it for two years.

332
00:18:34,093 --> 00:18:37,426
Look at it. It's falling down.
It's virtually condemned.

333
00:18:37,563 --> 00:18:41,124
It needs to be destroyed.
This is totally rotten.

334
00:18:42,601 --> 00:18:46,332
I've had it appraised.
A generous appraisal for $1 .200.

335
00:18:46,472 --> 00:18:50,169
Julian. I'm willing to offer you $1 .400
and $700 Canadian Tire money.

336
00:18:50,309 --> 00:18:54,643
And a chance for a new life
in my new park. What do you say?

337
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:56,680
- You see this trailer?

338
00:18:56,816 --> 00:18:59,944
My grandmother used to own that trailer.
Now. I own it. It's my home.

339
00:19:00,085 --> 00:19:02,076
I'm gonna start up a business
in that trailer.

340
00:19:02,221 --> 00:19:05,679
It's gonna be called Success Auto Body.
I've got a four-year plan on it.

341
00:19:05,825 --> 00:19:08,487
The wheels are already in motion. okay?
You're too late. Sorry.

342
00:19:08,627 --> 00:19:10,492
- Okay. Julian--
- Come on. Randy.

343
00:19:10,629 --> 00:19:12,426
- Look--
- Your minute's up.

344
00:19:12,565 --> 00:19:14,863
- Yeah. okay. I'm going.
I'm not gonna offer you...

345
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,298
I'm not gonna ask you
to sign anything here.

346
00:19:17,436 --> 00:19:19,336
- Thank you.
- Just will you consider it?

347
00:19:19,472 --> 00:19:22,464
Just consider the important nature.
Good night. guys.

348
00:19:22,608 --> 00:19:24,769
- You'd be a hero!
- Thanks a lot. Thanks. Rick. Bubbles.

349
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:26,844
- We're tired. If you guys wanna
come back tomorrow.

350
00:19:26,979 --> 00:19:28,810
maybe have a couple of drinks
or whatever...

351
00:19:28,948 --> 00:19:32,247
- Success Auto Body...
That's kind of a shitty name.

352
00:19:32,818 --> 00:19:35,378
- Randy. see... there's no need of you
having to say that.

353
00:19:35,521 --> 00:19:37,182
Just... there's no need of that
whatsoever.

354
00:19:37,323 --> 00:19:40,759
Like. if you're gonna disrespect us.
I mean. I could just sit here and...

355
00:19:40,893 --> 00:19:43,361
I could piss all over your new car.
if you want.

356
00:19:43,496 --> 00:19:45,521
If you're gonna disrespect us.
maybe I'll disrespect you.

357
00:19:45,664 --> 00:19:46,858
- Ricky. fuck off. Ricky...

358
00:19:46,999 --> 00:19:49,058
- Just let them drive away.
- He's pissin' on the car.

359
00:19:49,201 --> 00:19:51,362
- Very nice car. It is. I like it a lot.

360
00:19:51,504 --> 00:19:53,028
- You stared at his cock enough. Randy.

361
00:19:53,172 --> 00:19:55,640
- Thanks for coming down to see us.
I really enjoyed it.

362
00:19:55,774 --> 00:19:57,901
- Just remember:
you drew the first piss.

363
00:19:58,577 --> 00:20:02,013
- You just remember:
you drew first. fuck off!

364
00:20:02,147 --> 00:20:03,512
- Bubbles...

365
00:20:03,649 --> 00:20:05,549
Sorry about the hair. bud.
It was an accident.

366
00:20:05,684 --> 00:20:07,049
- Yeah. yeah...

367
00:20:07,186 --> 00:20:09,347
- What the fuck is he talking about?
Did he...

368
00:20:09,488 --> 00:20:13,117
- You know what. Ricky?
- Did you do this or did he do this?

369
00:20:13,259 --> 00:20:16,092
- I wasn't gonna tell you.
Those two bastards did it.

370
00:20:16,228 --> 00:20:17,991
- My fuck...
- Listen. It was an accident. come on.

371
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:20,291
- What I'm gonna do to them
is gonna be an accident.

372
00:20:20,432 --> 00:20:22,525
We can't just fucking let them
get away with that!

373
00:20:22,668 --> 00:20:26,126
- Ricky is a problem.
He's always been a problem.

374
00:20:26,272 --> 00:20:29,002
But. uh... I'm hoping that
he'll go along with Julian's decision.

375
00:20:29,141 --> 00:20:31,666
and that maybe we can turn over
a new leaf.

376
00:20:34,046 --> 00:20:36,241
- What do you want. Ricky?

377
00:20:36,382 --> 00:20:38,748
- Fucking talk to the two of you guys
by myself.

378
00:20:38,884 --> 00:20:41,512
- Randy. get in the house. Randy.
- Frig off. Ricky.

379
00:20:41,654 --> 00:20:43,417
- You can't just go around shaving
people's fucking heads.

380
00:20:43,556 --> 00:20:45,319
- It was an accident. Ricky.
- Oh. accident. was it?

381
00:20:45,457 --> 00:20:46,947
- You'd better clear out of this park.

382
00:20:47,092 --> 00:20:49,083
You're not welcome here.

383
00:20:49,228 --> 00:20:53,722
Ricky. this is home invasion. bud.
You wanna go back to jail. Ricky?

384
00:20:53,866 --> 00:20:57,461
- Ricky. calm down. Calm down!
- I'll calm down in about five minutes.

385
00:20:57,603 --> 00:20:59,468
- Calm down. Listen. just calm down.

386
00:20:59,605 --> 00:21:02,233
- Oh. what the fuck
do we have here. Randy. uh?

387
00:21:02,374 --> 00:21:04,239
- I was doing my hair
and Bubbles came in.

388
00:21:04,376 --> 00:21:06,241
It was an accident. Ricky.
Have some rings. Ricky.

389
00:21:06,378 --> 00:21:08,346
Calm down. Eat some rings.
Have something to eat.

390
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,210
- I'd love some fucking onion rings.
- We can talk about this.

391
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:12,681
Just don't go crazy here. okay?

392
00:21:12,818 --> 00:21:15,343
- You deserve this. Randy.
for what you fucking did to Bubbles.

393
00:21:15,487 --> 00:21:17,387
You like that?
- Stop. you're hurting me.

394
00:21:17,523 --> 00:21:20,253
- Guess what? You're getting
your fucking head shaved right now

395
00:21:20,392 --> 00:21:22,292
'cause nobody shaves
my fucking friend's head.

396
00:21:22,428 --> 00:21:24,419
- What are you doing?! Ricky!

397
00:21:24,563 --> 00:21:27,691
- Stop fucking squirming.
- Ricky! Ah!

398
00:21:28,567 --> 00:21:30,694
- Get that away from me. Ricky!
- That's for fucking Bubbles. Randy.

399
00:21:30,836 --> 00:21:32,599
- Randy. are you okay. bud?

400
00:21:32,738 --> 00:21:35,070
- Fuck!
- Ricky. open the goddamn door.

401
00:21:35,207 --> 00:21:37,471
- Yeah? Marker time...

402
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:40,511
- What the fuck are you doin'. Ricky?
Stop it!

403
00:21:40,646 --> 00:21:42,011
- Ricky...
- Don't make me...

404
00:21:42,147 --> 00:21:46,277
- Do you have any idea
what you did to this town. Ricky?

405
00:21:46,418 --> 00:21:48,579
You know what you did. Ricky?

406
00:21:48,721 --> 00:21:50,484
- I know exactly what I fucking did.
- Randy?

407
00:21:50,623 --> 00:21:53,023
- What the hell did you do?
Are you okay?

408
00:21:53,158 --> 00:21:55,319
- Just came over here to talk.
No big deal.

409
00:21:55,461 --> 00:21:56,894
- To talk...?
- Randy made some food.

410
00:21:57,029 --> 00:21:58,963
Fucking onion rings are delicious.
Have some. Bubs?

411
00:21:59,098 --> 00:22:02,158
- Oh. man. you're gonna pay this time.
You are really gonna pay.

412
00:22:02,301 --> 00:22:04,360
- What do I owe you?
Two bucks for milk?

413
00:22:04,503 --> 00:22:07,131
- Shit... I don't know
what Ricky did to Randy.

414
00:22:07,272 --> 00:22:09,900
He's locked himself in the bathroom.
and he's crying.

415
00:22:10,042 --> 00:22:12,772
- What the fuck
do you want me to do?

416
00:22:14,179 --> 00:22:16,841
- I'm getting fucking drunk tonight!
Whoo!

417
00:22:16,982 --> 00:22:18,950
- Julian. it's not enough
to go through life

418
00:22:19,084 --> 00:22:22,747
relying on good looks
and an incredible body.

419
00:22:22,888 --> 00:22:25,186
The perfect man has got a good heart.

420
00:22:25,324 --> 00:22:28,851
Sometimes. you gotta put other people's
interests ahead of you own. Julian.

421
00:22:28,994 --> 00:22:32,395
That's a good. wholesome.
sexy thing to do.

422
00:22:36,935 --> 00:22:38,664
Ah... fuck.

423
00:22:47,413 --> 00:22:49,904
- Holy fuck. we drank a lot
last night. Lucy.

424
00:22:50,049 --> 00:22:52,142
Why don't we order
some goddamn chicken?

425
00:22:53,085 --> 00:22:55,883
- Ah... drinking is not all we did
last night.

426
00:22:56,021 --> 00:22:57,488
Huh?

427
00:23:03,295 --> 00:23:05,195
- Good morning. Julian.
- Good morning. Rick.

428
00:23:06,465 --> 00:23:08,057
- Good morning. Julian.
- Hey.

429
00:23:09,501 --> 00:23:12,095
I don't wanna sound cold. I mean.
like Julian and I.

430
00:23:12,237 --> 00:23:15,331
you know. we've known each other
for a while. but he's gotta...

431
00:23:15,474 --> 00:23:19,103
grow up a little bit. he's gotta...
take his life in a successful path?

432
00:23:19,244 --> 00:23:21,940
Great. But I don't really want
any part of it.

433
00:23:22,081 --> 00:23:26,415
- You know. I have always blamed Ricky
for all their little shenanigans.

434
00:23:26,552 --> 00:23:29,919
but frankly. it's Julian that invents
these little schemes.

435
00:23:30,055 --> 00:23:32,819
and gets everybody involved. and then.
he brings everybody down with him.

436
00:23:40,599 --> 00:23:42,965
- Hey. boys!
- Hey. what's up. man?

437
00:23:43,102 --> 00:23:45,627
- What's up. my man?
- Thanks for coming for the interview.

438
00:23:45,771 --> 00:23:48,501
- What's he talking about. boy?
- I told you about this. man.

439
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,108
- I'm hiring for the shop.
Don't worry about it now.

440
00:23:51,243 --> 00:23:53,541
I'm taking you guys out
for a company breakfast.

441
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:55,408
I'll explain all the details then.

442
00:23:55,547 --> 00:23:58,778
- Yeah. man. Don't worry. man.
- Interview? You said there was a show.

443
00:23:58,917 --> 00:24:02,375
- Yeah. it's for the shop. man.
I'll explain to you as we go. man.

444
00:24:02,521 --> 00:24:04,284
- I don't know if I'm feeling it.

445
00:24:04,423 --> 00:24:06,857
Take it from me.
'cause I know what will happen.

446
00:24:06,992 --> 00:24:10,758
I'm gonna make it in the rap game.
That will happen. That's a fact.

447
00:24:10,896 --> 00:24:12,523
Same way that it's a fact

448
00:24:12,664 --> 00:24:15,189
that Success Auto Body
will not be a success.

449
00:24:15,334 --> 00:24:18,098
It should be called
Unsuccess Auto Body.

450
00:24:18,237 --> 00:24:21,263
- I took out a full-page ad.
and between the people that I know

451
00:24:21,406 --> 00:24:23,101
that are gonna come.
wanting to hang out.

452
00:24:23,242 --> 00:24:24,937
have something to eat.
listen to J-Roc.

453
00:24:25,077 --> 00:24:28,444
And all the other people will read it.
I think it's gonna be pretty busy.

454
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:30,741
Maybe even too busy.

455
00:24:31,316 --> 00:24:34,683
- Julian got big plans.

456
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:36,788
but he...

457
00:24:36,922 --> 00:24:40,881
he ego-writin' cheques
that his brain can't cash. dog.

458
00:24:52,471 --> 00:24:56,066
- What the fuck are the Ship Captain
and Tenille up to now?

459
00:24:57,009 --> 00:24:59,034
- I've done some research.

460
00:24:59,178 --> 00:25:03,114
and I found out that if I did go
to court with Lahey.

461
00:25:03,248 --> 00:25:06,775
he could actually expropriate my land.
and if that happens. I'm fucked.

462
00:25:06,919 --> 00:25:09,820
So. right now. I've gotta buy some time.
get along with him.

463
00:25:09,955 --> 00:25:11,684
get the business running.

464
00:25:11,824 --> 00:25:15,191
Once it's up and running.
he can't do a thing to me.

465
00:25:15,327 --> 00:25:19,696
Listen... a lot of bullshit went down
with this head shaving. okay?

466
00:25:19,832 --> 00:25:23,233
I just wanna clear the air.
and put this past us.

467
00:25:23,368 --> 00:25:26,667
- We can put this past us. Julian.
We can clear the air.

468
00:25:26,805 --> 00:25:28,534
But first. I want you to see

469
00:25:28,674 --> 00:25:30,801
what Ricky did
to Randy's beautiful hair.

470
00:25:32,644 --> 00:25:34,578
Randy!

471
00:25:34,713 --> 00:25:36,704
Nice hat. Randy.

472
00:25:40,919 --> 00:25:42,648
- Look at this.

473
00:25:46,158 --> 00:25:47,853
- Ricky shaved all his hair off

474
00:25:47,993 --> 00:25:50,723
and scribbled it in with black marker.

475
00:25:52,164 --> 00:25:54,962
We did what we could to fix it
trying to make it look normal.

476
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:56,897
It still looks fucked!

477
00:25:59,104 --> 00:26:01,129
I demand an apology from Ricky.

478
00:26:02,541 --> 00:26:04,338
- Just a sec.

479
00:26:04,476 --> 00:26:06,410
I can't believe what you did
to his fucking hair.

480
00:26:06,545 --> 00:26:09,070
- I didn't do all that. I just shaved
it once. It was squiggly!

481
00:26:09,214 --> 00:26:12,183
I did the little curl. that's it.
They fucked it up when they fixed it.

482
00:26:12,317 --> 00:26:15,582
- Come on. Our fucking life depends
on this. Ricky!

483
00:26:17,589 --> 00:26:21,025
- Randy? He's got something
to say to you.

484
00:26:26,899 --> 00:26:29,891
- I'm sorry that you shaved
Bubbles' head.

485
00:26:30,035 --> 00:26:32,196
It kind of made me get that done
to your head

486
00:26:32,337 --> 00:26:34,305
with a permanent marker. and I didn't...
I don't know.

487
00:26:34,439 --> 00:26:36,100
I'm sorry. I guess.
that it all happened.

488
00:26:40,312 --> 00:26:41,711
Fuck you. then.

489
00:26:41,847 --> 00:26:43,144
- Ricky...
- Randy...

490
00:26:47,619 --> 00:26:49,883
- I don't know why you didn't just
wash it off.

491
00:26:50,022 --> 00:26:52,456
- I tried... I won't come out.

492
00:26:52,591 --> 00:26:55,059
- All right. Are you cool. Ricky?

493
00:26:55,193 --> 00:26:57,661
- Yeah.
- You even. now. Bubs?

494
00:26:57,796 --> 00:27:01,789
- I believe I've achieved satisfaction.
- Okay. You guys go wait in the car.

495
00:27:01,934 --> 00:27:03,731
I gotta talk to Jim about his offer.
- Randy...

496
00:27:05,938 --> 00:27:08,771
- I'm thinking more about that deal
you offered me.

497
00:27:08,907 --> 00:27:12,138
- Good.
- It's starting to sound pretty good.

498
00:27:12,277 --> 00:27:14,939
- You come over tomorrow.
and I'll show you your new trailer.

499
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,911
It is fantastic.

500
00:27:17,049 --> 00:27:19,108
I'm sure it will help you make up
your mind.

501
00:27:19,251 --> 00:27:21,242
- Just a second. Randy?

502
00:27:21,386 --> 00:27:24,253
You don't need the hat. buddy. okay?

503
00:27:24,389 --> 00:27:26,084
Here. take it.

504
00:27:26,224 --> 00:27:28,158
It looks... you look good.

505
00:27:28,293 --> 00:27:29,851
Looks tough.

506
00:27:29,995 --> 00:27:31,860
- Really?

507
00:27:31,997 --> 00:27:34,022
- Yeah.

508
00:27:34,166 --> 00:27:37,397
- Julian told him he looked tough.
Think he started to believe it. but...

509
00:27:37,536 --> 00:27:39,595
He does not look tough.
he looks fucked.

510
00:27:40,372 --> 00:27:43,466
- Okay. guys. nice and steady.

511
00:27:43,608 --> 00:27:45,838
Keep it coming.

512
00:27:46,712 --> 00:27:49,010
That's it. Slow it down.

513
00:27:50,382 --> 00:27:52,247
All right. that's good. That's good.
That's good.

514
00:27:52,384 --> 00:27:54,375
T. J-Roc. get over here.

515
00:27:55,921 --> 00:27:58,287
Now with this newspaper ad.
it might get real busy tomorrow.

516
00:27:58,423 --> 00:28:00,220
We might have
to turn people away. okay?

517
00:28:00,359 --> 00:28:03,226
So. I want you guys to get lots of rest.
no drinkin' tonight.

518
00:28:03,362 --> 00:28:05,887
- All right.
- I can have a couple of drinks.

519
00:28:06,031 --> 00:28:08,727
- It's gonna be an early morning.
No drinkin'.

520
00:28:08,867 --> 00:28:11,597
And Bubs. get rid of this church shit.

521
00:28:11,737 --> 00:28:13,728
- Y'all took that from a church?

522
00:28:14,339 --> 00:28:17,672
That's cold. dog. You don't fuck
with church. motherfuckers.

523
00:28:17,809 --> 00:28:20,505
Come on. now.
Old people and their beans?

524
00:28:20,645 --> 00:28:22,806
- Come on. man.
- What's wrong with you!

525
00:28:22,948 --> 00:28:25,007
- It's all good. man. Just go. man.

526
00:28:36,094 --> 00:28:37,652
- Hi!
- Hey...

527
00:28:37,796 --> 00:28:39,388
- How are you doin'?
- Good.

528
00:28:39,531 --> 00:28:41,829
Come in.

529
00:28:41,967 --> 00:28:43,264
Oh. hey guys!

530
00:28:43,402 --> 00:28:46,565
How are you doing?

531
00:28:46,705 --> 00:28:50,607
Oh... Oh. fuck.
I'm sorry I let you down.

532
00:28:50,742 --> 00:28:52,539
I'm gotta get you out. though.

533
00:28:54,079 --> 00:28:57,947
See. these are all free-range kitties.
They don't like being locked up.

534
00:28:58,083 --> 00:29:00,643
- Free-range kitties?
- Yeah. they do as they please.

535
00:29:00,786 --> 00:29:03,050
That's their... whole thing.

536
00:29:05,757 --> 00:29:09,659
- It's cool if you don't... but. uh...
do you wanna smoke a joint?

537
00:29:11,229 --> 00:29:12,526
- Yes. please.

538
00:29:12,664 --> 00:29:15,792
It's kind of hard to explain. but...

539
00:29:15,934 --> 00:29:18,801
I have these friends. and they're...

540
00:29:18,937 --> 00:29:21,667
kind of like my family. and...

541
00:29:21,807 --> 00:29:24,708
sometimes. they do dumb things.
you know. and...

542
00:29:24,843 --> 00:29:27,175
I end up doing dumb things with them.

543
00:29:28,213 --> 00:29:30,511
But it's only because I love them.

544
00:29:30,649 --> 00:29:34,312
You know. they're... like my...
only family.

545
00:29:36,321 --> 00:29:40,257
- Yeah...
- I hope you don't think I'm too crazy.

546
00:29:44,663 --> 00:29:46,790
Are you feeling that yet?

547
00:29:54,306 --> 00:29:56,297
- Oh. man...

548
00:29:57,742 --> 00:30:00,108
- Fuck. I love kitties.
- Hmm...

549
00:30:02,681 --> 00:30:04,581
- Could something bad actually
happen to them

550
00:30:04,716 --> 00:30:06,581
if I don't get them out of here soon?

551
00:30:06,718 --> 00:30:09,050
- It'll just cost too much
to keep them here.

552
00:30:10,188 --> 00:30:11,712
- Yeah...

553
00:30:11,857 --> 00:30:14,883
Well. my friends are trying to raise
the money as we speak. so...

554
00:30:21,333 --> 00:30:24,097
- Perfect!
- Oh. fuck!

555
00:30:24,236 --> 00:30:26,568
- I don't know. Julian.
it's... close. I guess.

556
00:30:26,705 --> 00:30:29,105
You guys wanna come in for a tour?

557
00:30:29,241 --> 00:30:31,175
- We can't have a great opening
without balloons!

558
00:30:31,309 --> 00:30:34,506
- Man. I'm sorry I fucked up. man.
- With the price of balloons nowadays...

559
00:30:34,646 --> 00:30:37,547
- Steel roll-up garage door I put in.

560
00:30:37,682 --> 00:30:39,912
Come on in!
Success Auto Body.

561
00:30:40,051 --> 00:30:42,645
All brand-new concrete floors.

562
00:30:42,787 --> 00:30:46,689
All new lighting.
overhead lighting and side lighting.

563
00:30:46,825 --> 00:30:48,816
Ricky did that. Nice job. Ricky.

564
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,087
- Thanks. Bubs.
- And that's the paint station there.

565
00:30:51,229 --> 00:30:55,029
All the paints ready to go.
I can rock tunes on that music thing.

566
00:30:55,167 --> 00:30:58,603
All the tools are hung up. ready to go.
We got recycling...

567
00:30:58,737 --> 00:31:01,968
This is a professional-looking
operation.

568
00:31:02,107 --> 00:31:04,598
- I need to do my sound check.
Can't work with that gear.

569
00:31:04,743 --> 00:31:08,179
- Yeah. but what is it? A big concert?
- No. but it was a deal.

570
00:31:08,313 --> 00:31:10,508
So why don't you replace it
before the show?

571
00:31:10,649 --> 00:31:12,844
- Listen. it's about opening up
a business. all right?

572
00:31:12,984 --> 00:31:15,919
- With J-Roc performing.
Maybe I'll tell my fans not to come.

573
00:31:16,054 --> 00:31:17,919
- Listen. hold on. Boys...
we're officially open.

574
00:31:18,056 --> 00:31:19,819
Let's go meet the customers.

575
00:31:19,958 --> 00:31:21,323
- Come on.

576
00:31:30,969 --> 00:31:33,096
- Yo!

577
00:31:33,238 --> 00:31:34,398
Yo!

578
00:31:34,539 --> 00:31:36,336
- Hey. excuse me. Julian?

579
00:31:36,474 --> 00:31:38,874
When do I rock the mic. dog?

580
00:31:39,010 --> 00:31:41,774
- Just wait for some customers.
- I've been waitin'. dog.

581
00:31:41,913 --> 00:31:44,279
- Just keep waitin'. then.
- Yo!

582
00:31:44,416 --> 00:31:45,781
Aw. yeah!

583
00:31:45,917 --> 00:31:48,147
Aw. yeah!... Yeah...

584
00:31:48,286 --> 00:31:49,412
Yeah...

585
00:31:49,554 --> 00:31:50,714
- J-Roc...

586
00:31:50,855 --> 00:31:53,881
- Oh my!
- Lahey...

587
00:31:58,763 --> 00:32:02,358
- Hey. Jim.
- Afternoon. gentlemen.

588
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:05,833
Julian. what you managed
to accomplish here

589
00:32:05,971 --> 00:32:09,998
in such a short time is...
it's very attractive.

590
00:32:10,141 --> 00:32:13,770
I think you'll find that you've got
a little problem with the... location.

591
00:32:13,912 --> 00:32:18,246
I'm willing to sweeten my offer:
I'll help you move your garage.

592
00:32:18,383 --> 00:32:20,715
and I'll foot all the bills.
- Why would he help you?

593
00:32:20,852 --> 00:32:24,515
You're the one who fucking had us
thrown in jail for the last two years.

594
00:32:24,656 --> 00:32:27,921
- We're victims of our own actions.
It's kind of like a stupid tax.

595
00:32:28,059 --> 00:32:30,493
The stupider you are. the more you pay.

596
00:32:31,229 --> 00:32:34,824
- Yeah? Well. the more fucked you are.
the more fucked you are.

597
00:32:35,934 --> 00:32:37,959
- I hope you make the right decision.
Julian...

598
00:32:39,504 --> 00:32:41,734
... or things could get really nasty.

599
00:32:41,873 --> 00:32:44,068
- Two minutes for looking so whack.

600
00:32:44,442 --> 00:32:47,673
The two of you race in this slut
in the Grecian Formula One.

601
00:32:47,812 --> 00:32:49,006
with your painted hair?

602
00:32:49,147 --> 00:32:52,139
You going back to Baldhead Rock.
Mr. Lahey. with your whack car?

603
00:32:52,284 --> 00:32:54,411
- Stay out of the old park!

604
00:32:54,552 --> 00:32:57,146
- Go on and play
your leprechaun golf. bitch!

605
00:32:58,423 --> 00:33:00,118
- You know what. Julian?

606
00:33:01,693 --> 00:33:04,025
I'm not sure what success
is supposed to feel like.

607
00:33:04,162 --> 00:33:06,221
but I don't think this is it. man.

608
00:33:06,364 --> 00:33:08,332
I'm going to see the old man.

609
00:33:14,506 --> 00:33:17,942
- Come on. Julian!
Don't get discouraged now.

610
00:33:18,076 --> 00:33:20,169
Can't give up. I can't give up.

611
00:33:22,113 --> 00:33:24,411
- Maybe I should have just went
with the radio ads.

612
00:33:24,549 --> 00:33:28,645
- Well. it's an idea.
Nobody reads the fucking newspaper.

613
00:33:30,588 --> 00:33:32,453
- Here we go.

614
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:35,058
Can't not be feelin'it
Jared's got the quickness

615
00:33:35,193 --> 00:33:37,127
Like a shorty with the thickness

616
00:33:37,262 --> 00:33:39,924
And we been over this
and over this

617
00:33:40,065 --> 00:33:42,625
'Cause you can't not be feelin'this
T. where's my track at. dog?

618
00:33:42,767 --> 00:33:44,735
- Man. it's over. man!
- What you talking about ''it's over''?

619
00:33:44,869 --> 00:33:47,167
You don't turn my track down
when I'm performing a show!

620
00:33:47,305 --> 00:33:51,332
- Ain't nobody here. man!
- Nobody here? Bubbles is here. dog.

621
00:33:51,476 --> 00:33:53,467
- Ain't nobody feelin' it.
Fuck!

622
00:33:55,146 --> 00:33:56,943
- What are you talking' about.
''nobody feeling it''. dog?

623
00:33:57,082 --> 00:33:59,312
- Ain't nobody feelin' this. man.
- I was feeling it. You don't...

624
00:33:59,451 --> 00:34:01,351
What are you doing?
- I'm taking my mic. man.

625
00:34:03,855 --> 00:34:05,846
- J-Roc. I was feeling it.

626
00:34:07,025 --> 00:34:08,925
Positive thinking.

627
00:34:15,567 --> 00:34:18,092
There's one thing I gotta know baby

628
00:34:19,337 --> 00:34:22,033
Can you open that soul
just one more time

629
00:34:22,173 --> 00:34:23,936
- Hey. Rick!

630
00:34:24,075 --> 00:34:26,771
- Oh my. fuck. Dad! This is it?

631
00:34:26,911 --> 00:34:28,902
- Come on up. man!

632
00:34:31,416 --> 00:34:35,375
- This is your new house?
A fucking tugboat. I love it.

633
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,385
- Ah. buddy! Hey. man!

634
00:34:37,522 --> 00:34:39,786
Watch your step here.

635
00:34:45,497 --> 00:34:47,624
So. how are things going?
Not so good. I hear?

636
00:34:47,766 --> 00:34:50,291
Success isn't doing so good.
is that what it is?

637
00:34:50,435 --> 00:34:53,962
- Not one customer. Dad. None...

638
00:34:54,105 --> 00:34:56,073
- Fuck. buddy. it's...

639
00:34:56,207 --> 00:34:58,937
The problem is that... it's Julian. man.

640
00:34:59,077 --> 00:35:01,978
He's... always running off
with these crazy ideas.

641
00:35:02,113 --> 00:35:05,014
But that's his dream.
Don't you have your own dreams. Rick?

642
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:09,249
- Oh. Dad... I mean. I do.

643
00:35:09,387 --> 00:35:11,014
I just...

644
00:35:11,156 --> 00:35:13,886
I feel so stu...
goddamn stupid sometimes.

645
00:35:14,025 --> 00:35:16,152
and I don't know if I could do it
by myself.

646
00:35:16,294 --> 00:35:18,319
- Oh... don't...
I don't wanna hear you say that. Rick.

647
00:35:18,463 --> 00:35:21,159
Lucy's telling me you're gonna get
your grade 12. Rick.

648
00:35:21,299 --> 00:35:22,459
- I am.

649
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,090
- I mean. think about that.

650
00:35:24,235 --> 00:35:26,931
You know. there's nobody in our family
who's ever got their grade 12.

651
00:35:27,071 --> 00:35:29,198
I've never even met anybody
who's got his grade 12.

652
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:31,604
and you're almost there. man.

653
00:35:31,743 --> 00:35:33,643
That's smart.
- That's true.

654
00:35:33,778 --> 00:35:36,008
Well. I do have one pretty good idea.

655
00:35:36,147 --> 00:35:37,273
- Yeah?

656
00:35:37,415 --> 00:35:40,680
- I don't even know why it came to me.
but you know those green bins?

657
00:35:40,819 --> 00:35:42,309
You can get them anywhere.
anyone's house.

658
00:35:42,454 --> 00:35:44,615
They're all over the place.
You take one of those...

659
00:35:44,756 --> 00:35:47,156
Put a light in the top.
one plant in the bottom.

660
00:35:47,292 --> 00:35:49,658
Everybody's going to the mall buying
this shitty mall dope.

661
00:35:49,794 --> 00:35:52,627
There's no good dope around.
Especially with me in jail.

662
00:35:52,764 --> 00:35:56,063
I could sell them one of these things.
for a couple hundred bucks.

663
00:35:56,201 --> 00:35:58,465
which I would make
at least 150 off that.

664
00:35:58,603 --> 00:36:01,231
and they'd have a pound of weed
in 45 days.

665
00:36:01,372 --> 00:36:04,364
- Oh. Rick. listen to me. man.
That's a brilliant idea.

666
00:36:04,509 --> 00:36:06,272
That's a brilliant idea.
- You really think so?

667
00:36:06,411 --> 00:36:09,175
- Yes. and you can do it.
Let me just... let me just...

668
00:36:09,314 --> 00:36:11,339
You know what these are. right?
They're battery cables. right.

669
00:36:11,483 --> 00:36:13,508
- Mm-hmm.
- Just regular battery cables.

670
00:36:13,651 --> 00:36:15,084
But here's the thing.

671
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:17,586
All through life. man.

672
00:36:17,722 --> 00:36:21,351
you've hooked one battery cable
onto your battery. which is good.

673
00:36:21,493 --> 00:36:23,085
You need that.

674
00:36:23,528 --> 00:36:27,259
But you've always taken this battery
cable. the positive battery cable...

675
00:36:29,701 --> 00:36:32,568
...and you hooked it to Julian.
Pretend I'm Julian. okay?

676
00:36:32,704 --> 00:36:34,331
So. you hooked it to Julian.

677
00:36:34,472 --> 00:36:35,632
- Okay.

678
00:36:35,773 --> 00:36:39,709
- You're startin' your dreams...
off Julian's battery.

679
00:36:40,512 --> 00:36:43,072
You see? See what I'm saying?
What you gotta do. Rick.

680
00:36:43,214 --> 00:36:46,206
what you gotta do is take
this fucking positive cable

681
00:36:46,351 --> 00:36:49,684
that's been on Julian's battery.
and you hook it there.

682
00:36:50,822 --> 00:36:52,585
Feel it now?

683
00:36:52,724 --> 00:36:54,624
Now. start it up.

684
00:36:55,627 --> 00:36:58,152
- You are totally fucking right.
- You're out of here.

685
00:36:58,296 --> 00:37:00,457
Go.

686
00:37:00,598 --> 00:37:03,624
- Look. Dad. you just make everything
make so much sense.

687
00:37:04,736 --> 00:37:06,931
I mean. Julian's thing
wasn't working out.

688
00:37:07,071 --> 00:37:09,266
I gotta do something for me.
and my dad's totally right.

689
00:37:09,407 --> 00:37:11,068
I'm not gonna let
Julian boss me around.

690
00:37:11,209 --> 00:37:13,040
So... I'll help him out
when I have time.

691
00:37:13,177 --> 00:37:14,610
but I'm doin' my own business now.

692
00:37:14,746 --> 00:37:17,214
I came to this neighbourhood.
My dad told me to come here.

693
00:37:17,348 --> 00:37:19,077
There's green bins everywhere.
it's green bin day.

694
00:37:19,217 --> 00:37:20,809
And these people live in these houses.

695
00:37:20,952 --> 00:37:22,783
you can take whatever you want
from them.

696
00:37:22,921 --> 00:37:25,685
and they don't care.
as long as you be nice to them.

697
00:37:25,823 --> 00:37:27,313
they think you're not a criminal.

698
00:37:50,748 --> 00:37:53,410
- Ricky. just... hang on!

699
00:37:54,953 --> 00:37:57,478
- Oh... check these out. Bubs!

700
00:37:58,756 --> 00:38:01,816
- Oh. my God!
- Those are not fucking around.

701
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:04,087
- They're not fucking around!

702
00:38:04,228 --> 00:38:06,321
Hi. little fella.

703
00:38:08,299 --> 00:38:10,164
- It's gonna totally work.

704
00:38:10,301 --> 00:38:12,326
- How much loot
is it going to haul in. though?

705
00:38:12,470 --> 00:38:15,462
- Quite a bit. I think. and if it does.
the first thing I'm doing. buddy.

706
00:38:15,607 --> 00:38:17,541
is helping you with your cats.
Don't worry about them.

707
00:38:17,675 --> 00:38:21,702
- It's awesome and everything.
but how long is it gonna take.

708
00:38:21,846 --> 00:38:24,371
Time is... you know...

709
00:38:24,515 --> 00:38:26,278
- It's gonna take some time.

710
00:38:26,417 --> 00:38:28,442
My fucking head is driving me nuts!

711
00:38:28,586 --> 00:38:31,282
Do you ever get your head
like when it just won't shut up.

712
00:38:31,422 --> 00:38:33,481
and it keeps talking to itself. and...
it's killing me.

713
00:38:33,625 --> 00:38:36,253
So I started studying.
and my dad. it's just yap. yap. yap!

714
00:38:36,394 --> 00:38:38,453
Fuck. what is that?

715
00:38:38,596 --> 00:38:41,087
- That's thinking.
- It's what?

716
00:38:41,232 --> 00:38:42,859
- Thinking. You're thinking.

717
00:38:43,668 --> 00:38:46,228
You know. your brain's probably
using parts

718
00:38:46,371 --> 00:38:48,362
that have never been used.

719
00:38:48,506 --> 00:38:51,498
- That's all that is?
- Yeah! It's good!

720
00:38:52,677 --> 00:38:55,805
- Well. one of the thinks I had was that
you could help me with this.

721
00:38:55,947 --> 00:38:58,381
and help me study. and I'll cut you in.

722
00:38:58,516 --> 00:39:00,347
We'd be like a team.

723
00:39:00,485 --> 00:39:02,953
- You'll cut me in on this
if I help you study?

724
00:39:03,087 --> 00:39:06,056
- It's a fuck of a lot better
than what's going on over there.

725
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:07,452
- Look.
- Deal.

726
00:39:14,132 --> 00:39:18,262
- Jesus. look at Randy's head.
The marker hasn't faded at all.

727
00:39:18,403 --> 00:39:20,496
He looks like a goddamn weevil.

728
00:39:21,539 --> 00:39:23,473
- Hey. Julian.
- Hey. Bubbles.

729
00:39:23,608 --> 00:39:27,044
- How's it going. Jimmy?
- Good. Nice to see you.

730
00:39:27,178 --> 00:39:30,341
This is it! Full-treated sun deck
with a lifetime guarantee.

731
00:39:30,481 --> 00:39:33,473
Piss shack will be going in
in two days. Check this out.

732
00:39:33,618 --> 00:39:35,381
Full cathedral ceiling.

733
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,613
Hallelujah

734
00:39:37,755 --> 00:39:40,815
Vinyl mullions in all the windows.
and you won't believe this kitchen.

735
00:39:40,958 --> 00:39:43,518
You've got oak veneer panelling
on the doors.

736
00:39:43,661 --> 00:39:45,754
We got matching ebony microwave.

737
00:39:45,897 --> 00:39:48,593
and a dishwasher which Bo-Bandy
installed this morning.

738
00:39:48,733 --> 00:39:50,394
Good work. Bo-Bandy.

739
00:39:50,535 --> 00:39:52,230
Full electric heating.

740
00:39:52,370 --> 00:39:54,600
You have laundry. second entrance.

741
00:39:54,739 --> 00:39:58,766
and a beautiful master bedroom
with a bathroom ensuite.

742
00:39:58,910 --> 00:40:01,378
But this is the piece de resistance.

743
00:40:01,512 --> 00:40:02,740
Tadam!

744
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,438
Full complementary bar.

745
00:40:05,783 --> 00:40:07,648
Let me freshen your drink.
will you. Julian?

746
00:40:07,785 --> 00:40:09,844
- Where did you get that picture
of Julian. Mr. Lahey?

747
00:40:09,987 --> 00:40:12,046
- Bubbles. if you wanna drop over.
and see me later.

748
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:14,590
I might have a little deal for you. too.
Randy. contract.

749
00:40:14,726 --> 00:40:18,628
Julian. strike while the iron's hot.
What do you think?

750
00:40:18,763 --> 00:40:22,255
- It's a nice trailer. and...
it's really nice.

751
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:25,164
- Great. Sign right here.
- I still have one problem.

752
00:40:25,303 --> 00:40:27,533
What about my business?

753
00:40:27,672 --> 00:40:29,230
- What about your business?
- I just opened it.

754
00:40:29,373 --> 00:40:31,603
- Julian. I can give you six months
for your rent here.

755
00:40:31,743 --> 00:40:33,233
I'll sweeten the pot. Look!

756
00:40:33,377 --> 00:40:35,709
We could set your business up
next door if you want to.

757
00:40:35,847 --> 00:40:38,645
- Yeah. but then. I'll be paying lot
fees over there and lot fees here.

758
00:40:38,783 --> 00:40:41,217
- Julian. step outside.
There's something I gotta show you.

759
00:40:41,352 --> 00:40:43,217
Look at this wonderful side yard.

760
00:40:43,354 --> 00:40:46,414
- This is fucking nice.
- Oh. it's fucking nice. all right.

761
00:40:50,995 --> 00:40:52,257
Come on. Rick!
- What?

762
00:40:52,396 --> 00:40:54,762
- Come on. hurry up!
- Just gimme a second here.

763
00:40:54,899 --> 00:40:56,890
- You should've let me go first.

764
00:41:11,582 --> 00:41:13,607
I paid four grand for this car.
you know.

765
00:41:14,485 --> 00:41:16,976
- Yeah?
- It's appraised for seven.

766
00:41:18,356 --> 00:41:20,290
- Well. that's good. Julian.

767
00:41:20,424 --> 00:41:22,551
- How about I unload it.
and give you the cash.

768
00:41:22,693 --> 00:41:25,355
so you can put it towards your cats
to get them out?

769
00:41:26,597 --> 00:41:28,428
- Really?
- Yeah.

770
00:41:29,367 --> 00:41:31,631
- Ah... that would be awesome. but...

771
00:41:31,769 --> 00:41:35,227
I know what this limited edition
Monte Carlo SS means to you.

772
00:41:35,373 --> 00:41:37,238
- Bubs. your cats mean way more to me

773
00:41:37,375 --> 00:41:41,709
than this limited edition Monte Carlo SS
that's in mint condition.

774
00:41:41,846 --> 00:41:43,780
You mean more to me.

775
00:41:46,651 --> 00:41:48,551
I love you. you big goof.

776
00:41:49,654 --> 00:41:52,020
- I love you too. Julian.

777
00:41:52,757 --> 00:41:55,783
- I think Julian...

778
00:41:55,927 --> 00:41:57,827
really likes that trailer.

779
00:41:59,430 --> 00:42:02,126
- He said he wasn't even going to move.
He said he was stayin'.

780
00:42:02,266 --> 00:42:04,962
- Yeah. but that was what he said.
Randy. but he didn't mean that.

781
00:42:05,102 --> 00:42:07,434
Look. if you'd saw his body language.
You should've seen him.

782
00:42:07,572 --> 00:42:09,403
I saw him. He was just doing...

783
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:11,872
- I... I saw it. He said he's staying.

784
00:42:13,144 --> 00:42:16,705
- Randy... he's playing sexy hardball
with us.

785
00:42:18,115 --> 00:42:20,982
I think we should have a little drink
to celebrate--

786
00:42:21,118 --> 00:42:23,746
- Whoa!
- Just a little sip of beer. One sip.

787
00:42:23,888 --> 00:42:27,483
- You can't be serious.
- Yeah.

788
00:42:27,625 --> 00:42:29,252
Just one sip.

789
00:42:29,393 --> 00:42:32,487
- This is real beer with alcohol in it.
- It's organic beer. Randy!

790
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:36,031
Just one beer. Look. I'm never going
back on the hard liquor. Just...

791
00:42:36,167 --> 00:42:38,032
Look. Celebratory sip.

792
00:42:38,169 --> 00:42:40,103
- It's alcohol!
- It's...

793
00:42:40,638 --> 00:42:43,698
Randy. it doesn't count.
Beer and coolers don't count.

794
00:42:43,841 --> 00:42:46,571
Randy. my problem's with hard liquor.
It's not with beer.

795
00:42:46,711 --> 00:42:48,645
Look. the... Just let it go.

796
00:42:48,779 --> 00:42:50,542
Let it go.

797
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:54,047
- Two years...

798
00:42:54,185 --> 00:42:57,621
It's just been a countdown
to liquor day. hasn't it?

799
00:42:57,755 --> 00:43:00,246
Asshole...
- One fucking sip is all I wanted.

800
00:43:00,391 --> 00:43:02,621
- You're a fucking alcoholic!
- You're a prick.

801
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:04,990
- Two years. and you just flushed it
down the toilet.

802
00:43:06,030 --> 00:43:07,691
- Liquor makes me think. Randy!

803
00:43:07,832 --> 00:43:09,891
Liquor
makes me think. Randy!

804
00:43:10,034 --> 00:43:12,229
- This is whack. dog.
- What do you mean. man?

805
00:43:12,370 --> 00:43:14,304
- This is bullish. It's greasy.
It's amateur hour.

806
00:43:14,438 --> 00:43:16,463
- I thought you were down
with the program?

807
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:19,337
- Bubs. you gonna be okay?
- Yeah. I'm fine.

808
00:43:19,477 --> 00:43:21,570
- All right. well.
talk to you in a bit. man.

809
00:43:53,010 --> 00:43:54,910
- All right. let's get this over with.

810
00:43:56,914 --> 00:43:59,508
T. I changed my mind.
I'm not feeling this. dog.

811
00:43:59,650 --> 00:44:01,481
- What are you talkin' about?
- Not feeling it. dog.

812
00:44:01,619 --> 00:44:03,712
Some weird shit's gonna go down.
I'm not feeling it.

813
00:44:03,854 --> 00:44:06,584
- Look. man. you just need to relax.
You need to calm down. man.

814
00:44:06,724 --> 00:44:08,885
Everything's gonna be all right.
- It ain't gonna be all right.

815
00:44:09,026 --> 00:44:10,994
And it ain't worth fucking up
my career up. dog.

816
00:44:11,128 --> 00:44:12,561
It ain't worth it. We should bust.

817
00:44:12,697 --> 00:44:15,723
- Look. we just need to do this.
we'll go home and get a few drinks.

818
00:44:15,866 --> 00:44:17,731
There's gonna be a lot of hos out
tonight.

819
00:44:17,868 --> 00:44:21,497
- I don't give a fuck. I'm gonna bust.
You bustin' with me?

820
00:44:21,639 --> 00:44:23,266
- Sorry. dog.
- I'm out.

821
00:44:23,407 --> 00:44:26,934
- We don't have all fucking night here.
guys.

822
00:44:27,078 --> 00:44:29,478
- T. what the fuck is going on?
- He's backing out. man!

823
00:44:29,613 --> 00:44:31,513
- What. he's bailing?

824
00:44:31,649 --> 00:44:32,843
- Yeah. man.

825
00:44:39,357 --> 00:44:41,348
- Come on. let's burn it.

826
00:44:45,162 --> 00:44:46,959
- Go. Ricky!

827
00:44:55,873 --> 00:44:57,738
- Ricky. your trunk's on fire.

828
00:44:57,875 --> 00:45:01,641
- I know! Don't be a pussy. man!
It'll just burn itself out.

829
00:45:14,759 --> 00:45:16,886
- Did you clean the onion ring crumbs
out of the bed?

830
00:45:17,028 --> 00:45:19,155
- Yes. I cleaned the onion rings
out of the friggin' bed.

831
00:45:19,296 --> 00:45:21,560
- You're not gonna eat those goddamn
onion rings for breakfast again?

832
00:45:21,699 --> 00:45:23,724
- Just shut up.
and just let me eat breakfast?

833
00:45:23,868 --> 00:45:25,028
- You're getting all greasy.

834
00:45:25,169 --> 00:45:27,433
You've never been this fat
before in your life! Stand up.

835
00:45:27,571 --> 00:45:29,129
- No.
- Stand up.

836
00:45:29,273 --> 00:45:31,764
- Jeez...
- You're sucking it in. Let it hang out.

837
00:45:31,909 --> 00:45:33,570
Oh. God! This is disgusting.

838
00:45:33,711 --> 00:45:36,373
You don't want to go to Cuba
with that greasy boiler. do you?

839
00:45:36,514 --> 00:45:39,176
- I don't wanna go to Cuba.
They don't even have any fucking dope.

840
00:45:39,316 --> 00:45:41,443
- They have dope in Cuba.
- They don't. It's Communist country.

841
00:45:41,585 --> 00:45:44,247
- Randy!
- Just fuck off with the ''Randys''!

842
00:46:04,208 --> 00:46:05,675
- Hey. guys!

843
00:46:05,810 --> 00:46:07,539
Off the deck. please. Off the deck.
- Okay.

844
00:46:07,678 --> 00:46:09,612
- Julian. right?
- Yeah.

845
00:46:09,747 --> 00:46:12,511
- Your car was reported stolen
last night. And we found it.

846
00:46:12,650 --> 00:46:15,778
- Are you kidding me?
- Yeah. it was incinerated.

847
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:18,480
- Oh...
- At 4 a.m.. under the bridge.

848
00:46:18,622 --> 00:46:21,750
- Ah. fuck!
- What were you doing this morning?

849
00:46:21,892 --> 00:46:24,326
- I was paintin' a car last night
in there.

850
00:46:25,796 --> 00:46:27,423
- Anybody working with you
who could verify that?

851
00:46:27,565 --> 00:46:28,759
- No.

852
00:46:28,899 --> 00:46:32,096
- Well. so far.
Julian's gotten away with it.

853
00:46:32,236 --> 00:46:34,670
You know...
he's a person of interest though.

854
00:46:34,805 --> 00:46:37,103
in the arson of his own car.

855
00:46:37,241 --> 00:46:39,141
They're investigating him.

856
00:46:39,276 --> 00:46:43,076
I appreciate what he was trying to do.
It was a nice thing. but...

857
00:46:43,214 --> 00:46:44,681
Fuck!

858
00:46:48,719 --> 00:46:50,243
- Hey. Bubs!

859
00:46:50,387 --> 00:46:52,412
- Hey. Mr. Lahey!

860
00:46:54,959 --> 00:46:56,756
- Ah...

861
00:46:56,894 --> 00:47:00,660
The job of Garden Manager comes
with deluxe accommodation. Bubbles.

862
00:47:00,798 --> 00:47:03,665
The salary starts at 16.5.
with full pension benefits.

863
00:47:03,801 --> 00:47:06,964
Guaranteed. it's an awful lot easier
than say...

864
00:47:07,104 --> 00:47:08,765
working at a body shop for a living.

865
00:47:08,906 --> 00:47:10,601
Spent a lot of time
setting this up.

866
00:47:10,741 --> 00:47:13,710
Very well-appointed kitchen.

867
00:47:13,844 --> 00:47:17,245
Extremely comfortable bed. and...

868
00:47:17,381 --> 00:47:19,212
full shower.

869
00:47:19,350 --> 00:47:21,545
once we get the sewer hooked up.

870
00:47:21,685 --> 00:47:25,246
So... did Julian mention anything to you
about anything?

871
00:47:26,690 --> 00:47:30,854
- No. not really. I mean. he's
pretty busy with Success Auto Body.

872
00:47:30,995 --> 00:47:33,463
- How's that going?
- Pfft... good!

873
00:47:38,869 --> 00:47:41,337
- Hey. Chris! What's up. man!
- What's up. Ricky?

874
00:47:41,472 --> 00:47:43,030
- Can I park here?

875
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:49,611
Small tokes. man.
This stuff's fucking potent.

876
00:47:49,747 --> 00:47:51,681
- Thanks. man.
- Ricky.

877
00:47:51,815 --> 00:47:53,783
Jail Outreach. Grade 12.

878
00:47:53,918 --> 00:47:56,250
Oh. yeah. cameras.
You gotta do the whole searchy.

879
00:47:56,387 --> 00:47:59,288
I'm telling you right now:
I got something on me. so...

880
00:47:59,423 --> 00:48:01,653
Yeah. Just a bit of green.
I tell you. man.

881
00:48:01,792 --> 00:48:04,260
I don't plan on coming back here.
but if I do.

882
00:48:04,395 --> 00:48:08,058
I just want you to put that away.
You smoke just as much as I do.

883
00:48:08,199 --> 00:48:10,133
- Yeah.
- I'll just give you a couple of those.

884
00:48:10,267 --> 00:48:11,632
- Thanks. man.

885
00:48:11,769 --> 00:48:14,033
- Want to boost me up
so I can hide this somewhere?

886
00:48:16,106 --> 00:48:17,767
Okay. cool.

887
00:48:20,110 --> 00:48:22,203
- Ahem. Ten more minutes left
in the exam.

888
00:48:22,346 --> 00:48:24,109
Ten more minutes.

889
00:48:25,983 --> 00:48:29,077
- So. this must be the...
the recording device. Is it?

890
00:48:29,220 --> 00:48:31,120
- Yeah.
- Nice.

891
00:49:19,937 --> 00:49:21,802
- Hey. buddy!

892
00:49:33,984 --> 00:49:36,475
- Yo! Yo! What's going on. T?

893
00:49:38,455 --> 00:49:42,255
What's going on with you. man?
Yeah! Je-ah! How are you feeling?

894
00:49:42,393 --> 00:49:43,951
- I'm just working. man!

895
00:49:44,094 --> 00:49:47,325
- Let me ''aks'' you something
real quick. dog.

896
00:49:47,464 --> 00:49:50,729
Anyone all up in your eyes
about that arson bullshit?

897
00:49:50,868 --> 00:49:52,859
- No. man.
Ain't nobody talk to me. man.

898
00:49:54,004 --> 00:49:55,699
- You shook?
- I didn't shook. man.

899
00:49:55,839 --> 00:49:57,932
Julian didn't shook. I didn't shook.

900
00:49:58,075 --> 00:49:59,838
- Well. I didn't shook.

901
00:50:01,779 --> 00:50:04,748
I don't shook about nothing in my life
right now. dog.

- Man. don't even talk to me about that
record label shit. man.

905
00:50:11,889 --> 00:50:13,857
You're always...
Don't suck your teeth at me. man.

906
00:50:13,991 --> 00:50:15,481
Don't suck your teeth at me!

907
00:50:15,726 --> 00:50:17,216
Don't suck your teeth at me!

908
00:50:17,361 --> 00:50:20,159
- Don't give me no reason to suck them
and I won't suck them!

909
00:50:20,297 --> 00:50:22,959
- Once he realizes
not to suck his teeth at me. you know.

910
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:25,330
we can have a nice conversation.
and be boys and stuff.

911
00:50:25,469 --> 00:50:26,868
But it could have got really ugly.

912
00:50:27,004 --> 00:50:29,632
And I don't like it when motherfuckers
suck their teeth at me. man!

913
00:50:29,773 --> 00:50:31,502
So don't be sucking your teeth at me.

914
00:50:31,642 --> 00:50:33,610
- I don't like sucking them.
you know what I mean?

915
00:50:33,744 --> 00:50:37,271
When I sucked them. I was like...
''T. man! Where'd you go. dog?''

916
00:50:37,414 --> 00:50:39,405
I don't even recognize
that motherfucker no more.

917
00:50:39,550 --> 00:50:41,882
'Cause we had a dream.
the two of us.

918
00:50:42,019 --> 00:50:44,817
Now. he's talking about how he doesn't
believe in the dream no more.

919
00:50:44,955 --> 00:50:46,650
Now suddenly. I'm one motherfucker
having to believe

920
00:50:46,790 --> 00:50:48,052
in the whole dream by myself.

921
00:50:48,192 --> 00:50:50,990
It was more dope when it was
two of us believing in one.

922
00:50:51,128 --> 00:50:54,256
'cause it was only 50% of the dream
each of us was responsible for.

923
00:50:54,398 --> 00:50:57,458
Whatever happened to the two of us?

924
00:50:57,601 --> 00:50:59,364
- You know what happened. man.
Big change.

925
00:50:59,503 --> 00:51:02,063
- What happened? Where did you go?
- Big change. big things.

926
00:51:02,206 --> 00:51:04,333
- Where are you at?
Big change. go on.

927
00:51:04,475 --> 00:51:06,238
Go on to your oil change.

928
00:51:26,196 --> 00:51:28,426
- Can I get you another wine cooler?
- Sure!

929
00:51:30,167 --> 00:51:32,863
- Oh-oh... no more wine coolers.
Do you want a tall boy?

930
00:51:33,003 --> 00:51:34,402
- You drank all my wine coolers?

931
00:51:34,538 --> 00:51:36,972
- There was only a couple left.
Randy.

932
00:51:37,107 --> 00:51:38,904
- For fuck's sakes!
- We're having a couple of problems.

933
00:51:39,042 --> 00:51:40,373
you and I.

934
00:51:40,511 --> 00:51:43,207
- No shit!
- Yeah. I want you to tell me something.

935
00:51:43,347 --> 00:51:45,747
Tell me what the fuck
you got in this bag.

936
00:51:45,883 --> 00:51:48,249
What? Start talking.

937
00:51:48,385 --> 00:51:50,285
- It's old stuff.
I don't even do that anymore.

938
00:51:50,421 --> 00:51:52,082
Listen. if you're gonna be
so goddamn nosy.

939
00:51:52,222 --> 00:51:55,282
why don't you explain why you're hiding
pictures of Julian in your shaving kit.

940
00:51:55,426 --> 00:51:57,155
- I don't hide pictures of Julian
in the washroom.

941
00:51:57,294 --> 00:51:58,625
I don't know what
you're talking about.

942
00:51:58,762 --> 00:52:01,196
You promised me you were never
gonna go on the street again.

943
00:52:01,331 --> 00:52:04,767
- And I haven't! You promised me
you weren't gonna drink again.

944
00:52:04,902 --> 00:52:06,267
And you are!

945
00:52:06,403 --> 00:52:07,961
- Beer or wine coolers is not drinking.
Randy.

946
00:52:08,105 --> 00:52:10,539
- It is drinking! I think you've been
lying to me all along.

947
00:52:10,674 --> 00:52:14,041
- We agreed. No more man-whoring.
You're the liar.

948
00:52:14,178 --> 00:52:16,908
- You're out of your goddamn mind!
- Oh. you turned real tough

949
00:52:17,047 --> 00:52:19,072
ever since Ricky shaved your head.
did you.

950
00:52:19,216 --> 00:52:22,379
- If you go on the hard liquor again.
I'm out of here.

951
00:52:24,188 --> 00:52:25,917
- Are you ready. Bubs?
Moment of truth.

952
00:52:26,056 --> 00:52:28,081
- Fuck. I get nervous about things
like this.

953
00:52:28,225 --> 00:52:31,991
I hope we've wired it right.
- Well. if we didn't. we'll just fix it.

954
00:52:34,465 --> 00:52:37,434
Nice work!
- Yeah! Yes!

955
00:52:37,568 --> 00:52:39,934
Oh. hang on. they're smoking a bit.

956
00:52:40,070 --> 00:52:42,004
- It's just the foil.
It'll smoke for about an hour.

957
00:52:43,307 --> 00:52:44,968
- How's it going. boys?
- Fucking incredible.

958
00:52:45,108 --> 00:52:48,544
- How did you do on your test. man?
- You know what. Julian?

959
00:52:48,679 --> 00:52:50,169
I think I fucking aced it.

960
00:52:50,314 --> 00:52:52,043
- No way!
- Yeah!

961
00:52:52,182 --> 00:52:53,479
- Congrats. man!
- Good job!

962
00:52:53,617 --> 00:52:57,314
- Check this shit out. boys!
- I think you're onto something good.

963
00:52:57,454 --> 00:52:58,887
- Dope is success.

964
00:52:59,022 --> 00:53:01,923
You don't need business plans or charts
or pictures or any of that bullshit.

965
00:53:02,059 --> 00:53:04,857
You hiring?

966
00:53:04,995 --> 00:53:06,724
- What. you'd actually come work for me?

967
00:53:06,864 --> 00:53:09,594
- If that means getting his cats back.
yeah. I'll help out.

968
00:53:09,733 --> 00:53:12,531
- Well. I got no problem with that.
but I'm in charge.

969
00:53:12,669 --> 00:53:14,034
This is my thing.

970
00:53:14,171 --> 00:53:16,002
- You're the boss. bud.
- Julian. look at them.

971
00:53:16,139 --> 00:53:19,404
Think of the money we can make
going door to door selling these things.

972
00:53:21,512 --> 00:53:23,377
Who the fuck is that coming?

973
00:53:23,514 --> 00:53:26,074
Fuck. it's Lahey.
He's in the fuckmobile. boys.

974
00:53:26,216 --> 00:53:27,979
- Howdy. guys!

975
00:53:29,319 --> 00:53:31,514
Guess who's back
on the liquor...

976
00:53:36,627 --> 00:53:39,152
- Fuck. I'm sorry. Jim.
I thought you were the garbage.

977
00:53:39,997 --> 00:53:42,966
What the fuck do you want?

978
00:53:43,100 --> 00:53:45,933
- Actually. Ricky.
I was just driving around.

979
00:53:46,069 --> 00:53:48,299
looking for someone to be my friend.

980
00:53:48,438 --> 00:53:52,568
- Oh. Looking for friends. are you?
So. who do we got tonight?

981
00:53:52,709 --> 00:53:55,200
Friendly Lahey out for a couple
of drinks...

982
00:53:55,345 --> 00:53:57,074
or Fucky. The Drunk Clown?

983
00:53:59,249 --> 00:54:03,015
- Ricky. you never know...

984
00:54:03,153 --> 00:54:05,417
when the circus is gonna come to town.

985
00:54:05,556 --> 00:54:07,456
You better stand back. buddy.

986
00:54:10,394 --> 00:54:12,954
- Oh. you fucking drunk prick!

987
00:54:13,096 --> 00:54:15,530
I should've fucking known it.

988
00:54:18,402 --> 00:54:22,498
Why is it that every fucking thing
I try to do always gets cocked up?

989
00:54:22,639 --> 00:54:25,335
- Oh... I probably don't need
to point this out.

990
00:54:25,475 --> 00:54:27,602
but we have another massive failure
on our hands.

991
00:54:27,744 --> 00:54:29,974
Goddamnit!

992
00:54:30,113 --> 00:54:32,081
Fuck this bullshit!

993
00:54:32,215 --> 00:54:36,117
We're going to the animal shelter.
and we're breaking my cats out tonight.

994
00:54:36,253 --> 00:54:39,848
I got this planned out.
so get suited up. we're doing this.

995
00:54:39,990 --> 00:54:41,355
And don't argue with me.

996
00:54:41,491 --> 00:54:44,824
- But I can't...
- Don't do it!

997
00:54:44,962 --> 00:54:47,931
- Why do we have to fucking back in?
- 'Cause I'm in charge. Ricky.

998
00:54:48,065 --> 00:54:51,762
And I want us to pull in the right way
to make a getaway. Okay. boys.

999
00:54:51,902 --> 00:54:55,269
Now listen. Stick to the plan
and it should go off without a hitch.

1000
00:54:55,405 --> 00:54:59,569
All right? This is a McMillan 383.
I researched this.

1001
00:55:01,411 --> 00:55:05,313
Now the excess magnetization
from a hotel card...

1002
00:55:06,416 --> 00:55:10,011
... coupled with the reverse polarity
of a high interest rate credit card.

1003
00:55:10,153 --> 00:55:15,716
should allow a Nova Scotia health card
modified to...

1004
00:55:16,259 --> 00:55:18,625
Come on. baby. Ching. fuck it!

1005
00:55:18,762 --> 00:55:20,821
Come on. boys. Okay. now wedge
something in there

1006
00:55:20,964 --> 00:55:23,660
'cause now that I've overruled
the mechanism. it locks from both sides.

1007
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:27,861
Julian. go in position B. You guys.
sorry but you fuck up too much.

1008
00:55:28,005 --> 00:55:31,338
- I can't believe that worked!
I'm in position.

1009
00:55:31,475 --> 00:55:33,272
Stay out here...

1010
00:55:33,410 --> 00:55:36,436
Come on!

1011
00:55:36,580 --> 00:55:38,548
Grab these boxes.
Get as many kitties as you can.

1012
00:55:40,984 --> 00:55:42,212
- Shut the fuck up!

1013
00:55:42,352 --> 00:55:44,616
- Ricky. you're agitating them.
Making them louder.

1014
00:55:44,755 --> 00:55:46,279
- Keep it down!

1015
00:55:46,423 --> 00:55:48,948
- Listen to them now. They're
fucking barking their heads off.

1016
00:55:49,092 --> 00:55:52,323
Shut the fuck upI
Shut the fuck upI

1017
00:55:52,462 --> 00:55:55,260
- You're just agitating them.
Go over to cell block 8.

1018
00:55:55,399 --> 00:55:59,062
Get the fuck going.
More of my kitties are over there.

1019
00:55:59,202 --> 00:56:00,897
Listen to the fucking dogs!

1020
00:56:01,038 --> 00:56:03,268
- You motherfucker!

1021
00:56:03,407 --> 00:56:06,774
- Someone's coming.
- Fuck offI

1022
00:56:06,910 --> 00:56:08,935
Do you know how much
these fucking pants cost?

1023
00:56:10,914 --> 00:56:13,405
- Fuck. boys...
Get down. Everybody get down!

1024
00:56:13,550 --> 00:56:15,347
- We gotta keep grabbing...
- Security!

1025
00:56:15,485 --> 00:56:17,419
- Roof! Roof! You fucking like
the sound of that?

1026
00:56:17,554 --> 00:56:20,819
- I'm grabbing these cats first.

1027
00:56:20,957 --> 00:56:23,391
- Julian. the dogs are ruining
everything. They're fucking this up.

1028
00:56:23,527 --> 00:56:25,791
They won't leave me alone.
They're biting my cock.

1029
00:56:25,929 --> 00:56:29,296
They ripped my beautiful pants.
BullshitI

1030
00:56:29,433 --> 00:56:31,401
- Bubbles. come in.
Get the fuck out of there.

1031
00:56:31,535 --> 00:56:33,662
- You know how fucking long
I've had these track pants?

1032
00:56:33,804 --> 00:56:34,896
Can't even get them anymore.

1033
00:56:35,038 --> 00:56:38,599
- Jesus!
- You dirty cocksucker.

1034
00:56:42,045 --> 00:56:45,503
- Ricky. what are you doing?!
Oh. my God!

1035
00:56:45,649 --> 00:56:48,140
- Bubbles. I forgot my fucking pants!
- Reverse polarity.

1036
00:56:48,285 --> 00:56:50,219
Jesus. boys. which card is it?

1037
00:56:50,353 --> 00:56:53,720
- I can't remember.
- Yo. what the fuck!

1038
00:56:53,857 --> 00:56:56,018
Let me out!
- Listen. sirens!

1039
00:56:56,159 --> 00:56:59,026
- Guys. get me out of here!

1040
00:56:59,162 --> 00:57:01,062
- The cops are coming.
We gotta leave you behind.

1041
00:57:01,198 --> 00:57:03,666
- What?

1042
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:05,927
- Sorry. T.
- Fuck...

1043
00:57:06,069 --> 00:57:08,469
- Sorry. man. they have my fucking
track pants.

1044
00:57:08,605 --> 00:57:09,572
- Fuck!

1045
00:57:14,377 --> 00:57:18,905
- Don't move! Stay where you are!
- Who breaks into the fucking SPCA?!

1046
00:57:23,353 --> 00:57:24,843
- Hey. des tu me. Julian?

1047
00:57:24,988 --> 00:57:26,922
- Ah... I don't want to talk to him
right now.

1048
00:57:27,057 --> 00:57:29,525
- Can I ''aks'' you something real quick?
It's me. the motherfucker

1049
00:57:29,659 --> 00:57:31,718
whose DJ's in jail
'cause you fucked up. bitch!

1050
00:57:31,862 --> 00:57:34,797
Tell me it ain't true. dog.
Tell me what the truth is.

1051
00:57:34,931 --> 00:57:37,661
Where the fuck is T at?
- Listen. Tyrone's my friend. too.

1052
00:57:37,801 --> 00:57:39,098
- Where's he at?
- He's in jail.

1053
00:57:39,236 --> 00:57:41,204
Oh. my fuck. I feel bad for you.

1054
00:57:41,338 --> 00:57:43,431
'cause I'm about to bip you in the eye.

1055
00:57:43,573 --> 00:57:45,473
Bip! Bip!
- Okay. everything's my fault.

1056
00:57:45,609 --> 00:57:48,874
If you want to hit me
to make you feel better. go for it.

1057
00:57:49,012 --> 00:57:51,173
- All right. Shut your eyes
and set your alarm clock. bitch.

1058
00:57:51,314 --> 00:57:53,976
'Cause I'll tumble right now.
You try to line up with the jaw--

1059
00:57:54,117 --> 00:57:55,550
- Wait!

1060
00:57:55,685 --> 00:57:57,175
I was in charge.

1061
00:57:59,689 --> 00:58:01,714
All right. it's my fault T's in jail.

1062
00:58:01,858 --> 00:58:04,793
And you have no idea
how fucking terrible I feel.

1063
00:58:13,069 --> 00:58:15,970
- Motherfucker. Bubbles.
tell me that ain't the truth.

1064
00:58:16,106 --> 00:58:17,698
- It is.

1065
00:58:17,841 --> 00:58:20,105
And I'm... sorry.

1066
00:58:20,777 --> 00:58:22,574
- So you fucked up.

1067
00:58:22,712 --> 00:58:24,543
My DJ's in jail.

1068
00:58:24,681 --> 00:58:26,672
That's all because
of your fucking kitties.

1069
00:58:28,852 --> 00:58:30,649
- Yeah.

1070
00:58:32,823 --> 00:58:34,791
- B. you should feel terrible.

1071
00:58:36,526 --> 00:58:39,654
What the fuck do you think
is gonna happen with my career. dog?

1072
00:58:39,796 --> 00:58:41,730
Another man in jail
'cause of your kitties.

1073
00:58:41,865 --> 00:58:43,628
Go on with your stripe-shaped head.

1074
00:58:43,767 --> 00:58:45,496
It's whack and I'm not feeling it.

1075
00:58:45,635 --> 00:58:47,535
- I know it is.

1076
00:58:47,671 --> 00:58:49,536
- Enjoy your success. man.

1077
00:58:49,673 --> 00:58:52,608
Hope it smells nice on the outside
where my DJ ain't.

1078
00:58:54,211 --> 00:58:57,874
Wanna see success. Julian?
Keep your eyes on this! Yo!

1079
00:58:58,014 --> 00:59:01,040
Keep your eyes on this! Yo! Yo!
Brap! Yo!

1080
00:59:15,866 --> 00:59:17,834
- One little piggy...

1081
00:59:17,968 --> 00:59:20,027
two little piggies...

1082
00:59:20,170 --> 00:59:23,071
three little piggies.

1083
00:59:23,206 --> 00:59:24,901
- What about our food?

1084
00:59:25,041 --> 00:59:29,034
- Randy. I decided to lay off the food
for a bit. and go on booze.

1085
00:59:29,179 --> 00:59:31,079
You were right.
The beer was clouding my judgement.

1086
00:59:31,214 --> 00:59:32,806
I made a decision.

1087
00:59:34,150 --> 00:59:36,618
I need this to help me get through.
Randy.

1088
00:59:36,753 --> 00:59:38,948
- You had to have one drink of beer.
didn't you?

1089
00:59:39,089 --> 00:59:40,784
- You don't understand!

1090
00:59:40,924 --> 00:59:43,859
The liquor's calling the shots now.
Randy.

1091
00:59:50,166 --> 00:59:51,724
Hey. Randy?

1092
00:59:51,868 --> 00:59:53,631
Where are you going. bud?

1093
00:59:53,770 --> 00:59:56,830
- Mr. Lahey. where did you get
all the money for the liquor?

1094
00:59:56,973 --> 01:00:00,204
- Randy. to be perfectly honest:
I had to dip into the Cuba fund.

1095
01:00:00,343 --> 01:00:03,244
I need the hard liquor
to help me make it through this.

1096
01:00:04,214 --> 01:00:06,182
- I'm leaving you. Mr. Lahey.

1097
01:00:08,985 --> 01:00:10,976
- Maybe it's for the best. Randy.

1098
01:00:12,222 --> 01:00:14,850
Maybe I need
to drink this out alone. bud.

1099
01:00:18,595 --> 01:00:20,062
Randy...

1100
01:00:20,864 --> 01:00:22,297
Randy...

1101
01:00:22,933 --> 01:00:24,560
Randy!

1102
01:00:24,701 --> 01:00:27,169
You can't make it without me. bud!

1103
01:00:27,304 --> 01:00:28,794
You'll be back.

1104
01:00:29,239 --> 01:00:32,800
I fall

1105
01:00:32,943 --> 01:00:36,344
To pieces

1106
01:00:38,848 --> 01:00:43,717
Each time I see you again

1107
01:00:46,289 --> 01:00:51,283
I fall to pieces

1108
01:00:56,800 --> 01:00:58,825
- Just me and the liquor now.

1109
01:01:04,641 --> 01:01:06,666
Julian. I know
what you're trying to do here.

1110
01:01:06,810 --> 01:01:08,505
I know you're trying to get me drunk.

1111
01:01:08,645 --> 01:01:10,840
So. what's the big announcement?
Let's just get it out.

1112
01:01:10,981 --> 01:01:13,142
- Ahem...

1113
01:01:13,283 --> 01:01:15,114
I wanna rob a bank.

1114
01:01:15,251 --> 01:01:17,651
- Rob a bank?

1115
01:01:17,787 --> 01:01:20,221
- It's not exactly robbing a bank.

1116
01:01:20,357 --> 01:01:22,848
It's more like intercepting
money transfers.

1117
01:01:22,993 --> 01:01:25,325
- They're at the bank.
we go in. take them?

1118
01:01:25,462 --> 01:01:27,657
- Yeah.
- That's robbing a bank.

1119
01:01:29,099 --> 01:01:31,499
Julian. that's armed robbery.
I'm not fucking doing that.

1120
01:01:31,634 --> 01:01:32,726
- Fuck that.
- Listen.

1121
01:01:32,869 --> 01:01:35,394
We don't need
to use guns on this one.

1122
01:01:35,538 --> 01:01:38,132
Ricky. you know how dumb
those armed guards are.

1123
01:01:40,176 --> 01:01:43,873
They show up at the bank every Friday
at precisely 5 o'clock...

1124
01:01:44,014 --> 01:01:46,107
to collect the money deposits. okay?

1125
01:01:46,249 --> 01:01:48,581
All we gotta do is show up
10 minutes before them.

1126
01:01:48,718 --> 01:01:50,686
dressed exactly like they are.
in the same uniforms.

1127
01:01:50,820 --> 01:01:53,789
with an armoured van.
and it'll be a piece of cake.

1128
01:01:53,923 --> 01:01:55,720
- Piece of cake.

1129
01:01:55,859 --> 01:01:59,124
If it was a piece of cake like that.
why wouldn't people do it every day.

1130
01:01:59,262 --> 01:02:01,355
and people would be walking in.
talking piles of money?

1131
01:02:01,498 --> 01:02:02,658
- 'Cause they don't have the balls.

1132
01:02:02,799 --> 01:02:04,528
- Yeah. well. neither do I.
- Listen.

1133
01:02:04,667 --> 01:02:06,259
Let's just enjoy our meals. okay?

1134
01:02:06,403 --> 01:02:09,463
You guys don't have to give me
an answer right now.

1135
01:02:09,606 --> 01:02:12,939
Just think about it. Thanks. boys.

1136
01:02:13,076 --> 01:02:16,170
- And some more shooters and stuff. too.

1137
01:02:17,647 --> 01:02:19,581
- Give me the keys. You're hammered.
Give me them.

1138
01:02:19,716 --> 01:02:22,549
- I'm not fucking going home yet. guys.
Oh. no. A couple more drinks.

1139
01:02:22,685 --> 01:02:24,516
- Everything's closed.

1140
01:02:24,654 --> 01:02:26,417
- The fucking Dirty Burger's set up
on the waterfront.

1141
01:02:26,556 --> 01:02:28,615
I heard they're serving liquor. Come on.
Come on. guys!

1142
01:02:28,758 --> 01:02:30,623
Come on! We're partying here!

1143
01:02:30,760 --> 01:02:33,058
- I don't wanna go drinking
at the goddamn Dirty Burger.

1144
01:02:33,196 --> 01:02:36,859
- Shutting it down yet. boys.
Come on! Let's party here!

1145
01:02:38,968 --> 01:02:40,629
- Just hang on.

1146
01:02:40,770 --> 01:02:44,103
- Why?
- I don't wanna go out there.

1147
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:46,174
- Why not?
- No. no: liquor. drinks. Come on!

1148
01:02:46,309 --> 01:02:47,833
Let's get some more drinks.

1149
01:02:47,977 --> 01:02:49,774
- Man-whores. Ricky.
I'm scared of them.

1150
01:02:49,913 --> 01:02:53,076
- Man-whores can't do anything to you.
What do you mean. scared?

1151
01:02:53,216 --> 01:02:55,150
Come on! Liquor. drinks. Come on!

1152
01:02:55,285 --> 01:02:58,254
- How did you get so drunk?
- 1 7 shooters. Bubs!

1153
01:02:58,388 --> 01:03:01,255
You know how the liquor works!
Drink it and you're drunk!

1154
01:03:01,391 --> 01:03:04,690
- Oh yeah. look at the mob.

1155
01:03:04,828 --> 01:03:07,058
- Relax. Buds. Come on.

1156
01:03:07,197 --> 01:03:08,960
- Philly! Hey!

1157
01:03:09,099 --> 01:03:10,930
Good. buddy!

1158
01:03:11,067 --> 01:03:12,864
We need some burgers
and some drinks!

1159
01:03:13,002 --> 01:03:14,629
- Come over here. buddy!

1160
01:03:14,771 --> 01:03:17,797
Get a burger and a free drink
at the Dirty Burger!

1161
01:03:17,941 --> 01:03:21,900
- Jacob! Drinks! Drinks! Drinks!
Let's go!

1162
01:03:22,045 --> 01:03:24,673
- Come on. son! How are you doing?
- Good. How are you doing?

1163
01:03:24,814 --> 01:03:27,282
- Good. man. good.
- We're fucking on her tonight.

1164
01:03:27,417 --> 01:03:29,248
Come on. Bubs. Let's get some.

1165
01:03:29,385 --> 01:03:31,945
- Come on. Jacob.
Let's get that grub up.

1166
01:03:32,088 --> 01:03:33,919
- Let's have a burger here.
- And some drinks. buddy.

1167
01:03:34,057 --> 01:03:35,251
- Burgers and some fucking drinks.
Jacob.

1168
01:03:35,391 --> 01:03:37,086
- Keep your head on a swivel
around here.

1169
01:03:37,227 --> 01:03:38,660
- Whoo!

1170
01:03:38,795 --> 01:03:41,662
- Let's go with the drinks.
Come on...

1171
01:03:41,798 --> 01:03:44,460
- He's sucking the dart.

1172
01:03:44,601 --> 01:03:46,034
I'm not fucking going anywhere.

1173
01:03:46,169 --> 01:03:47,602
- Are you serious?
- I'm staying right here.

1174
01:03:47,737 --> 01:03:49,432
and I'm gonna have another
fucking few drinks.

1175
01:03:49,572 --> 01:03:53,133
I'm gonna eat about four burgers.
and fucking shut her down then.

1176
01:03:53,977 --> 01:03:56,468
- Ricky. I'm not hanging around here--
- Boys. boys. boys...

1177
01:03:56,613 --> 01:04:00,208
- That's Randy.

1178
01:04:00,350 --> 01:04:02,818
- That's not fucking Randy...
- Fucking Randy where?

1179
01:04:02,952 --> 01:04:06,854
Fuck. he's changing.
- What's he doing here. man?

1180
01:04:06,990 --> 01:04:09,982
- What do you think he's doing
on Man Whore Alley?

1181
01:04:11,794 --> 01:04:13,853
He's hooking.
Ah...

1182
01:04:13,997 --> 01:04:17,364
- He's hooking for cheeseburgers.
- That sucks.

1183
01:04:19,235 --> 01:04:20,862
- Ladies and gentlemen.

1184
01:04:21,004 --> 01:04:25,338
Moving up to the top not by stepping
on but merely by stepping over.

1185
01:04:29,812 --> 01:04:31,871
- Must be fighting with Lahey.

1186
01:04:32,015 --> 01:04:33,710
- I'd say so.

1187
01:04:38,888 --> 01:04:40,879
- He's not a bad dancer. though.

1188
01:04:42,859 --> 01:04:44,827
- Odd thing to say. Julian.

1189
01:04:53,937 --> 01:04:55,962
Who the fuck's the guy
that he's talking to?

1190
01:04:56,105 --> 01:04:57,766
Don't I know that guy?

1191
01:04:59,075 --> 01:05:00,838
- He does look familiar.

1192
01:05:04,981 --> 01:05:08,075
Oh. my Christ...
He's going with him.

1193
01:05:14,857 --> 01:05:17,917
- Oh. my fuck! Check it out. boys!

1194
01:05:18,061 --> 01:05:19,961
That fucking car

1195
01:05:20,096 --> 01:05:22,860
is fucking awesome!

1196
01:05:22,999 --> 01:05:26,935
- 66 El Camino. stroked out to a 404.

1197
01:05:27,070 --> 01:05:28,264
Fucking mint.

1198
01:05:28,404 --> 01:05:30,269
- Posi-traction. nitrous...

1199
01:05:30,406 --> 01:05:32,431
- 375 horsepower. dual exhaust.

1200
01:05:32,575 --> 01:05:35,635
- Fucking original paint.
- You better believe it. big boy!

1201
01:05:35,778 --> 01:05:39,179
- Ricky. come here.
Those are man-whores.

1202
01:05:39,315 --> 01:05:42,614
Greasy man-whores.
- Bubs. who gives a fuck?

1203
01:05:42,752 --> 01:05:44,617
A fucking El Camino!

1204
01:05:44,754 --> 01:05:47,018
You gotta pop the hood.
I gotta see your fucking engine.

1205
01:05:47,156 --> 01:05:50,455
- All right. I'm gonna get some drinks.
You guys like to party?

1206
01:05:50,593 --> 01:05:53,357
- Fucking party!
- All right. here we...

1207
01:05:53,496 --> 01:05:57,193
- It's time to go home.
- You like to fucking party?

1208
01:05:57,333 --> 01:06:00,268
- Oh. I love to party...

1209
01:06:03,039 --> 01:06:06,805
- Fucking clean!
- Okay. boys. You got the wrong idea.

1210
01:06:06,943 --> 01:06:08,376
- Ricky. we're going home.

1211
01:06:08,511 --> 01:06:10,479
- What a bunch of party poopers.
- You're fucking wasted. buddy.

1212
01:06:10,613 --> 01:06:13,047
- What the fuck?
- What are you doing.

1213
01:06:13,182 --> 01:06:15,673
coming down here
with only 15 fucking dollars!

1214
01:06:15,818 --> 01:06:17,217
- Police.

1215
01:06:17,353 --> 01:06:20,345
Stay where you are. Nobody move.
Police!

1216
01:06:20,490 --> 01:06:22,481
- Run. everybody. run!
- We're fucked!

1217
01:06:27,330 --> 01:06:28,922
- Dad. we're not fucked.

1218
01:06:31,934 --> 01:06:35,165
We are fucked! You sons of bitches!

1219
01:06:44,113 --> 01:06:47,549
- Come on. We might need him.

1220
01:06:47,684 --> 01:06:50,152
- Fuck!

1221
01:06:51,154 --> 01:06:54,317
- Officer. we can take him home
from here. okay?

1222
01:06:54,457 --> 01:06:56,118
He's a really good friend of ours.

1223
01:06:56,259 --> 01:06:59,558
We've been looking for him all night.
trying to get him off the street.

1224
01:06:59,696 --> 01:07:02,290
He doesn't need jail.
he just needs his friends right now.

1225
01:07:02,432 --> 01:07:04,525
- I need my buddies.
- What do you think. Keith?

1226
01:07:04,667 --> 01:07:05,964
- He's good people.
- Fucking right!

1227
01:07:06,102 --> 01:07:07,967
- All right.

1228
01:07:08,104 --> 01:07:09,969
All right. You can take him home.

1229
01:07:10,106 --> 01:07:12,973
- All right. thanks. officer.
- You got some good friends here. buddy.

1230
01:07:13,109 --> 01:07:15,543
- We're taking you home. buddy.
Come on.

1231
01:07:15,678 --> 01:07:16,872
- Fuck off.

1232
01:07:17,013 --> 01:07:19,379
- Fuck off.
- Take it easy.

1233
01:07:19,515 --> 01:07:22,177
- Fuck. Randy!
- Just get him home.

1234
01:07:22,318 --> 01:07:25,014
- Dicks!
- That your fucking bag. Randy?

1235
01:07:25,154 --> 01:07:26,314
- Fuck off!

1236
01:07:28,257 --> 01:07:29,246
Fuck...

1237
01:07:30,526 --> 01:07:33,359
- Use your legs. bud.
- What the fuck are you doin'?

1238
01:07:33,496 --> 01:07:34,656
- We're going home. Randy.

1239
01:07:34,797 --> 01:07:36,662
- Fucking... You know what?

1240
01:07:36,799 --> 01:07:39,267
Just fucking pick me up here
tomorrow. boys.

1241
01:07:39,402 --> 01:07:41,336
- Ricky!
- I gotta...

1242
01:07:41,471 --> 01:07:43,666
I gotta piss. guys.
- Randy. don't...

1243
01:07:43,806 --> 01:07:45,603
- Get up.
- Give me my arm back.

1244
01:07:45,742 --> 01:07:48,108
- I'm tired. and I wanna go back home...
- Fuck!

1245
01:07:48,244 --> 01:07:51,008
- ... and get some drinks.
- Julian. he's pissing all over the...

1246
01:07:51,147 --> 01:07:53,377
Randy... place.

1247
01:08:09,165 --> 01:08:10,598
- Randy.

1248
01:08:14,003 --> 01:08:15,630
Randy. Come on. wake up.

1249
01:08:16,606 --> 01:08:18,301
Ricky. get up.

1250
01:08:18,441 --> 01:08:22,343
- Would you mind if I stayed with you
for a little while? I got nowhere to go.

1251
01:08:22,478 --> 01:08:25,379
- Yeah. you can stay on my deck. Randy.
- Thanks. Julian.

1252
01:08:25,515 --> 01:08:27,506
It will be our secret.

1253
01:08:34,657 --> 01:08:35,817
- Randy...

1254
01:08:56,412 --> 01:08:59,210
- Jim?
- What went on last night. man?

1255
01:08:59,348 --> 01:09:02,283
- Don't think it's any of your business.
- You think I'm stupid?

1256
01:09:02,418 --> 01:09:05,581
You can't expect to waltz back in here
after a night of man-whoring.

1257
01:09:05,721 --> 01:09:07,586
and fall back into my arms?

1258
01:09:07,723 --> 01:09:09,782
You can't do that to me. Randy.
You can't!

1259
01:09:09,926 --> 01:09:12,554
- I'm not! I'm just here
to get a couple of things.

1260
01:09:12,695 --> 01:09:15,596
My fryer. my onions...

1261
01:09:17,700 --> 01:09:20,498
I thought you should know.

1262
01:09:20,636 --> 01:09:22,160
I'm livin' with Julian.

1263
01:09:23,773 --> 01:09:25,070
- What did you say?

1264
01:09:25,208 --> 01:09:27,642
- I'm living with Julian.

1265
01:09:27,777 --> 01:09:29,404
We're dating.

1266
01:09:42,391 --> 01:09:45,224
- How often you working out anyway?

1267
01:09:45,361 --> 01:09:47,090
- Just keep shoveling. okay?

1268
01:09:51,634 --> 01:09:53,499
- Won't have to go to the gym today.
though.

1269
01:09:57,039 --> 01:09:59,098
- I really hate to interrupt this!

1270
01:09:59,242 --> 01:10:01,540
- We're filling the sewer.
and you should be helping us.

1271
01:10:01,677 --> 01:10:04,578
- We need to talk.
- Yeah. I gotta talk to you too. man.

1272
01:10:08,284 --> 01:10:09,774
Check it out.

1273
01:10:09,919 --> 01:10:12,786
An exact duplicate. man.
Precise in every detail.

1274
01:10:12,922 --> 01:10:14,913
This is a fucking work of art. man.

1275
01:10:16,292 --> 01:10:19,352
- Well. you did a great job.
but it doesn't mean fuck all to me.

1276
01:10:19,495 --> 01:10:21,053
'Cause I'm not doin' it.

1277
01:10:21,197 --> 01:10:22,630
- Why?

1278
01:10:23,499 --> 01:10:26,764
- Grade fucking 12 came today
in the mail.

1279
01:10:28,471 --> 01:10:30,200
- Randy... take the van.

1280
01:10:30,339 --> 01:10:32,364
hide it in the dump
before Lahey starts snooping around.

1281
01:10:32,508 --> 01:10:34,408
- Sure thing.

1282
01:10:34,544 --> 01:10:36,273
- You gotta think about this. man.

1283
01:10:36,412 --> 01:10:39,813
- Well. I've thought about it. you know?
It's time for me and my family.

1284
01:10:39,949 --> 01:10:42,042
Not for this.

1285
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:46,582
- Well. basically. after today.
I mean. I'm gonna get my grade 12.

1286
01:10:46,722 --> 01:10:51,557
I wanna share that with my family.
and... just start being a good person.

1287
01:10:51,694 --> 01:10:53,628
Not doing jobs anymore with Julian.

1288
01:10:53,763 --> 01:10:55,890
Not doing a bank robbery
for goddamn sure. it's stupid.

1289
01:10:56,032 --> 01:10:58,592
Once you have a grade 12.
you don't need to rob banks.

1290
01:10:58,734 --> 01:11:00,326
Why would you?
You can do anything.

1291
01:11:02,405 --> 01:11:04,839
I hope someday.
I can work with Julian again.

1292
01:11:04,974 --> 01:11:07,465
But right now.
my kitties are on the line.

1293
01:11:07,610 --> 01:11:09,475
and I can't take any more chances
with that.

1294
01:11:09,612 --> 01:11:11,978
till he gets his shit back together.

1295
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:26,551
- Hey. Bubbles!
What are you doing here?

1296
01:11:26,696 --> 01:11:29,824
- I came to accept that job offer.
- Fantastic news.

1297
01:11:29,966 --> 01:11:32,833
The best news of the day.
Snap of liquor?

1298
01:11:32,969 --> 01:11:36,905
- Is that all hard liquor?
- It's all liquor. It's all hard.

1299
01:11:38,007 --> 01:11:40,339
- Oh. my fuck...

1300
01:11:41,944 --> 01:11:43,935
- Glad you came to your senses. Bub.

1301
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:46,575
- Listen. Mr. Lahey.

1302
01:11:46,716 --> 01:11:49,048
This is only if I can get
the first six months

1303
01:11:49,185 --> 01:11:51,813
of my pay in advance. I'm sorry. but...
those are my conditions.

1304
01:11:51,954 --> 01:11:53,819
- You drive a hard bargain. Bubbles.

1305
01:11:53,956 --> 01:11:55,685
This is just between me and you:

1306
01:11:55,825 --> 01:11:58,817
Julian's gonna take the new trailer
'cause he has no choice.

1307
01:11:58,961 --> 01:12:02,556
- Oh... Look. do we have a deal or not?
I need something in writing.

1308
01:12:02,698 --> 01:12:04,256
- Absolutely. Bubs.

1309
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:07,130
You're gonna have your paperwork
in a minute. but...

1310
01:12:07,269 --> 01:12:09,100
first. if you don't mind.

1311
01:12:09,238 --> 01:12:13,834
I would appreciate if you would
take care of these for me. please.

1312
01:12:13,976 --> 01:12:15,671
- What?

1313
01:12:15,811 --> 01:12:18,075
I thought I was the garden manager!

1314
01:12:18,214 --> 01:12:19,374
- Bubbles!

1315
01:12:19,515 --> 01:12:21,949
- Garden managers don't fucking wash
old dirty pairs of underwear.

1316
01:12:22,084 --> 01:12:24,109
- You have many different varieties
of jobs. Bubbles.

1317
01:12:24,253 --> 01:12:26,346
Do you want it or not?

1318
01:12:26,489 --> 01:12:27,717
- Yes.

1319
01:12:43,906 --> 01:12:47,637
- Hey. Bubs! Hey. bud.
Got your contract.

1320
01:12:48,277 --> 01:12:49,539
There's a...

1321
01:12:49,679 --> 01:12:53,945
few extra-curricular activities
I need you to take care of here.

1322
01:12:54,684 --> 01:12:55,981
There you go.

1323
01:12:56,752 --> 01:13:00,119
So. I want you to take the gator over.
You okay to drive the gator?

1324
01:13:00,256 --> 01:13:01,689
- Yes.
- Good.

1325
01:13:01,824 --> 01:13:04,088
I need you to go over
and get the wheelbarrow.

1326
01:13:04,226 --> 01:13:05,887
come back.
and gravel around here. okay?

1327
01:13:06,028 --> 01:13:09,327
- Mr. Lahey. I don't understand anything
you're saying.

1328
01:13:09,465 --> 01:13:12,832
- I said. get the wheelbarrow.
and bring...

1329
01:13:14,570 --> 01:13:15,730
Good work. Bubs.

1330
01:13:15,871 --> 01:13:18,101
- Okay. are you all right?

1331
01:13:24,714 --> 01:13:27,274
- A man can only take so much abuse.

1332
01:13:27,416 --> 01:13:30,249
I've been playin' Mr. Nice Guy
for too long.

1333
01:13:30,386 --> 01:13:34,015
If Julian wants a fucking pissing match.
I'm your man.

1334
01:13:34,156 --> 01:13:36,090
You want a shot of Sweet Jack?

1335
01:13:37,660 --> 01:13:39,821
That's a goddamn dirty drink.

1336
01:13:40,696 --> 01:13:42,561
You guys wanna see something?

1337
01:13:44,033 --> 01:13:45,500
I'm asking you.

1338
01:13:45,634 --> 01:13:48,034
Do you wanna see me
do something really fucked up?

1339
01:13:52,141 --> 01:13:53,506
- Drink. Rand?
- Sure.

1340
01:13:57,747 --> 01:13:58,907
Attention!

1341
01:13:59,048 --> 01:14:00,811
Attention!

1342
01:14:01,450 --> 01:14:06,478
This is an emergency evacuation
of all trailers in this area.

1343
01:14:06,622 --> 01:14:09,591
I repeat: evacuate immediately.

1344
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:12,427
Get out. everybody!

1345
01:14:12,561 --> 01:14:14,586
Get the fuck out!

1346
01:14:14,730 --> 01:14:17,824
Evacuate all trailers immediately!

1347
01:14:17,967 --> 01:14:22,700
There's a construction accident
about to occur. This is an emergency.

1348
01:14:22,838 --> 01:14:24,703
- What the hell is he doin'?
- He flipped. Julian!

1349
01:14:24,840 --> 01:14:28,003
- ... trailers in this area.
- We gotta get the fuck out of here.

1350
01:14:28,144 --> 01:14:31,636
- I repeat! Evacuate. emergency!

1351
01:14:31,781 --> 01:14:35,478
A potential construction accident
is about to occur.

1352
01:14:35,618 --> 01:14:37,609
- Let's get the fuck out of here!

1353
01:14:37,753 --> 01:14:40,551
- Get out of the fucking trailers! Now!

1354
01:14:51,967 --> 01:14:53,832
- Oh... no!

1355
01:15:10,886 --> 01:15:12,114
- Tah-dah!

1356
01:15:13,556 --> 01:15:15,387
Julian!

1357
01:15:16,592 --> 01:15:19,356
You guys were
in a fucking incredible accident.

1358
01:15:19,495 --> 01:15:21,827
Julian. don't look so concerned. bud!

1359
01:15:21,964 --> 01:15:26,458
I got a cheque for 1 .400 bucks from
construction insurance comin' your way.

1360
01:15:26,602 --> 01:15:29,503
Guess what. Randy? I'm gonna
be able to build the fucking sewer.

1361
01:15:29,638 --> 01:15:32,038
Best news yet:
you guys get your own place.

1362
01:15:32,174 --> 01:15:35,940
Just up the street from me.
Win-win situation. boys.

1363
01:15:36,078 --> 01:15:38,046
- You finally lost it. Jim.

1364
01:15:38,180 --> 01:15:41,081
- Randy...
- You think you won. don't you?

1365
01:15:41,217 --> 01:15:43,617
Well. guess what:
my trailer's insured for $28.000.

1366
01:15:43,752 --> 01:15:46,744
which means I'm gonna rebuild it
right there. on that site.

1367
01:15:48,624 --> 01:15:51,184
- Oh...! What's left to say. guys?

1368
01:15:51,327 --> 01:15:53,158
You guys are made for each other.

1369
01:15:53,295 --> 01:15:55,229
Two sexy guys.

1370
01:15:55,364 --> 01:15:58,026
who don't have anything to do
with Jim Lahey.

1371
01:15:58,167 --> 01:16:00,601
'cause he likes to have a little drink
once in a while.

1372
01:16:00,736 --> 01:16:02,761
- You're a crazy fucking drunk.

1373
01:16:02,905 --> 01:16:04,964
- Yeah? The only difference
between me and you. Julian.

1374
01:16:05,107 --> 01:16:06,836
is a couple of drinks.

1375
01:16:16,385 --> 01:16:18,683
- I got the letter from the grade 12.
people!

1376
01:16:18,821 --> 01:16:21,881
- Oh! Well?
- Open it. Lucy. I can't do it.

1377
01:16:22,024 --> 01:16:23,321
- All right. Okay. ready?

1378
01:16:23,993 --> 01:16:25,984
''Dear Richard''--
- Come on. come on! What did I get?

1379
01:16:26,128 --> 01:16:29,962
- ''It is our sincerest... regret to''--
- What did I get? What did I get?

1380
01:16:30,766 --> 01:16:32,028
- 48.

1381
01:16:34,336 --> 01:16:37,100
- Out of what?
- 100.

1382
01:16:40,676 --> 01:16:43,611
- So. I didn't get it.

1383
01:17:13,242 --> 01:17:14,709
- Bubbles. where's Lahey?
- He's inside. Why?

1384
01:17:14,843 --> 01:17:16,902
- Stop what you're doing.
and come with me.

1385
01:17:17,046 --> 01:17:18,638
- Why?
- Now.

1386
01:17:19,815 --> 01:17:21,840
- Let go!

1387
01:17:21,984 --> 01:17:23,645
What's goin' on. Julian?

1388
01:17:23,786 --> 01:17:25,549
You come for the keys to the trailer?

1389
01:17:25,688 --> 01:17:26,950
- I'm not movin'.

1390
01:17:30,092 --> 01:17:32,322
- Is it true what they say about you
and Randy?

1391
01:17:33,195 --> 01:17:35,026
- Yeah. It is.

1392
01:17:36,999 --> 01:17:39,593
- Julian... let me take care of you.

1393
01:17:39,735 --> 01:17:42,169
- You get away from me!

1394
01:17:42,304 --> 01:17:43,965
You and I will have our day!

1395
01:17:44,106 --> 01:17:46,301
- Oh. I look forward to that day.
Julian.

1396
01:18:01,890 --> 01:18:03,551
- Well. looks like I'm in now.

1397
01:18:03,692 --> 01:18:05,956
- This is the exact replica
of the armoured van

1398
01:18:06,095 --> 01:18:08,996
that's gonna show up at the bank today
at precisely 5 o'clock.

1399
01:18:10,566 --> 01:18:11,999
Exact in every detail.

1400
01:18:12,134 --> 01:18:13,567
- Really?

1401
01:18:13,702 --> 01:18:16,671
Think those guys made their decals
out of electric tape?

1402
01:18:16,805 --> 01:18:18,033
- Don't pick at it.

1403
01:18:19,208 --> 01:18:21,574
- These are my hockey sticks.
and old lattice work.

1404
01:18:21,710 --> 01:18:24,736
- Trust me.
No one will notice the difference.

1405
01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:27,576
- Are you serious about this?
What are we gonna wear?

1406
01:18:27,716 --> 01:18:29,081
- Randy?
- These are made out of foam.

1407
01:18:29,218 --> 01:18:31,186
They're not exactly bullet-proof.
- They don't need to be.

1408
01:18:31,320 --> 01:18:33,880
They just have to look like they are.
No guns on this one.

1409
01:18:34,023 --> 01:18:36,116
That'd be armed robbery.
We don't have to go there.

1410
01:18:36,258 --> 01:18:39,227
- Oh. I like the no guns thing.
Did Ricky agree to that?

1411
01:18:39,361 --> 01:18:42,888
- No. we just have to go talk to him.
All right. let's suit up!

1412
01:18:43,866 --> 01:18:45,731
- Ricky. I need to talk to you.

1413
01:18:49,104 --> 01:18:51,197
Come over. man! This is important!

1414
01:18:53,342 --> 01:18:56,743
- We talked about this. okay?
I'm not doin' it. I'm with my family.

1415
01:18:56,879 --> 01:18:58,779
Don't be showin' up here.
trying to pressure me

1416
01:18:58,914 --> 01:19:01,280
to do stuff I don't wanna do.
- Lahey tried to kill me.

1417
01:19:01,417 --> 01:19:03,817
Okay. this is an emergency.
Could you step outside for a minute?

1418
01:19:03,952 --> 01:19:06,887
- Just what do you mean.
Lahey tried to fucking kill you?

1419
01:19:07,022 --> 01:19:09,923
- Lahey demolished Success Auto Body.
My fucking trailer's destroyed.

1420
01:19:10,059 --> 01:19:11,083
- What?

1421
01:19:11,226 --> 01:19:14,559
- Yeah. Ricky. He almost killed him.
He's on the hard liquor. Hard.

1422
01:19:14,696 --> 01:19:18,530
- Are you fucking serious?
- Yes! You gotta help us out. man!

1423
01:19:18,667 --> 01:19:21,636
We have to do this
before Lahey kills one of us. okay?

1424
01:19:21,770 --> 01:19:25,035
The armoured van is perfect.
I spent a lot of time on that.

1425
01:19:25,174 --> 01:19:28,575
It looks real. Ricky.
Come on. I've got an uniform for you--

1426
01:19:28,710 --> 01:19:31,338
- Julian. I failed my fucking grade 12.

1427
01:19:33,649 --> 01:19:35,446
Jail paper came today.

1428
01:19:35,584 --> 01:19:37,745
They said I failed
was what got wrote on it.

1429
01:19:44,326 --> 01:19:46,817
- You listen to me.

1430
01:19:46,962 --> 01:19:50,830
Are you gonna let a little piece
of paper take you out. huh?

1431
01:19:51,667 --> 01:19:53,862
Grade 12 is inside of you. man.
It's in your heart.

1432
01:19:54,002 --> 01:19:56,664
Just like it's inside of me.
just like it's inside of those two.

1433
01:19:56,805 --> 01:20:01,538
Randy only has grade 6 on paper.
but grade 12 is inside of him. man!

1434
01:20:02,678 --> 01:20:05,841
Come on... You've been a fighter
for as long as I've known you. man.

1435
01:20:05,981 --> 01:20:07,846
Now shake this off. Get up! Come on.

1436
01:20:09,218 --> 01:20:11,243
- So. you're in. Bubbles?
- I'm in. Ricky.

1437
01:20:11,386 --> 01:20:12,944
I've got no choice. I'm in.

1438
01:20:13,088 --> 01:20:15,022
- Do you know
what the fuck you're doin'?

1439
01:20:15,157 --> 01:20:17,921
- I'm at the top of my game.
- Come on. Ricky. Listen.

1440
01:20:18,060 --> 01:20:21,052
It's a fucking piece of paper.
Come on. please...

1441
01:20:21,196 --> 01:20:22,663
When do you ever care about paper?

1442
01:20:22,798 --> 01:20:25,164
- I don't. I don't give a fuck
about paper. Fuck paper.

1443
01:20:25,300 --> 01:20:26,995
- That's right. get mad.
- Right!

1444
01:20:27,136 --> 01:20:28,899
- Fuck books and fuck grade 12.

1445
01:20:29,037 --> 01:20:31,301
Even though we do... all have it in us.

1446
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:34,034
- Yeah. Ricky. come on!
Put it in. Let's do this.

1447
01:20:34,176 --> 01:20:36,007
- I feel like doin' this.

1448
01:20:36,578 --> 01:20:38,273
- Come on.
- Fuck it. Let's fucking do it.

1449
01:20:38,413 --> 01:20:39,937
How long are we gonna be gone?

1450
01:20:40,082 --> 01:20:42,209
- You're going to have a new RV
in 45 minutes.

1451
01:20:42,351 --> 01:20:43,784
- I'm in.
- Yeah!

1452
01:20:43,919 --> 01:20:47,218
- Lucy. I'm gonna be back in 45 minutes.
Just gonna go for a little drive.

1453
01:20:47,356 --> 01:20:49,381
No big deal.
Where's my uniform?

1454
01:20:55,597 --> 01:20:58,964
No dicking around. Bubbles. In and out.
We gotta go. We gotta do this.

1455
01:20:59,101 --> 01:21:01,569
- I know. Ricky. I know!
But I gotta do this.

1456
01:21:03,872 --> 01:21:05,840
- ... they're cute.

1457
01:21:05,974 --> 01:21:07,999
- Hi. Jenny. could I speak to you
in private?

1458
01:21:08,143 --> 01:21:11,078
- We're very busy. and Jenny's got--
- I really need to speak to her.

1459
01:21:11,213 --> 01:21:14,148
- I can't have you barging--
- I insist! I need to speak to her.

1460
01:21:14,283 --> 01:21:17,377
- Bubbles? Hurry the fuck up.
and get the fuck out to the vanI

1461
01:21:17,519 --> 01:21:20,977
- One Robby Baker.
''eleven-twelve''.

1462
01:21:21,123 --> 01:21:24,889
- You get the fuck in the van right now.
Time's gonna run out and you know it.

1463
01:21:25,027 --> 01:21:28,690
- Ricky. relax for two seconds.
- I'm not gonna fucking relax! I'm not!

1464
01:21:28,830 --> 01:21:30,320
- Jenny. don't worry about that.

1465
01:21:30,465 --> 01:21:33,832
Listen. we're about to do something.
and it's a bit tense.

1466
01:21:33,969 --> 01:21:38,406
And there's a chance that I might not
come back if things fuck up.

1467
01:21:38,540 --> 01:21:41,668
Will you promise me if that happens...

1468
01:21:41,810 --> 01:21:43,675
you'll look after my kitties. please?

1469
01:21:43,812 --> 01:21:45,677
- I promise.
- You will?

1470
01:21:45,814 --> 01:21:47,213
- Yeah.
- Pinky swear?

1471
01:21:47,349 --> 01:21:49,044
- Pinky swear.
- You have to.

1472
01:21:49,184 --> 01:21:52,381
- Mm-hmm.
- Thank you. Jenny. You're the best.

1473
01:21:52,521 --> 01:21:54,148
- Should never have come. Get in.
- Bubbles?

1474
01:21:54,289 --> 01:21:56,052
- Fuck! How much time do you need?

1475
01:21:56,191 --> 01:21:58,887
- Do you wanna go on a date
or something?

1476
01:21:59,027 --> 01:22:02,827
- Me and you on a date?
- Yeah. To the movies. or...

1477
01:22:02,965 --> 01:22:05,832
- I'd love to go on a date with you.

1478
01:22:05,968 --> 01:22:08,402
- Hurry the fuck up!

1479
01:22:08,537 --> 01:22:12,906
- Ricky. I swear the fuck on Jezebel
I'll fucking corn-on-the cob you!

1480
01:22:13,041 --> 01:22:15,202
- Bubbles. I'm sorry.
but it is fucking time!

1481
01:22:15,344 --> 01:22:18,973
I'm sorry. I don't know who you are.
he's late for his work.

1482
01:22:19,114 --> 01:22:21,412
- I apologize.
He's being a real dick today.

1483
01:22:21,550 --> 01:22:23,177
- Hmm...
- I'm being a dick?

1484
01:22:23,318 --> 01:22:27,277
You're being a fucking dick.
Do you know what's fucking at stake?

1485
01:22:27,422 --> 01:22:29,720
- Hi.
- Get the fuck in the van.

1486
01:22:29,858 --> 01:22:31,985
- Ricky. you're...
- Look at these things.

1487
01:22:32,127 --> 01:22:34,561
That's what they're saying to us
right now. Get in.

1488
01:22:35,897 --> 01:22:37,387
- Hey...

1489
01:22:37,532 --> 01:22:40,092
- I want everybody to stay cool.
and stay calm.

1490
01:22:40,235 --> 01:22:44,103
If you stay cool. no one will know
the difference. Here we go. boys.

1491
01:22:44,239 --> 01:22:45,536
- Let's go.

1492
01:23:19,274 --> 01:23:22,175
- Oh. my God. man! It's locked!
- It's fucking locked.

1493
01:23:23,945 --> 01:23:25,412
- Sorry. guys.

1494
01:23:26,648 --> 01:23:28,548
Here you go. guys.

1495
01:23:28,684 --> 01:23:31,312
- All right... thank you.
- Thanks.

1496
01:23:38,260 --> 01:23:40,057
- Give me a hand. man.

1497
01:23:42,264 --> 01:23:44,027
- Randy. come on.
We gotta get out of here.

1498
01:23:44,166 --> 01:23:45,531
- You gotta go home.
- For fuck's sakes!

1499
01:23:45,667 --> 01:23:47,965
You gotta get out of here right now!
- You get out!

1500
01:23:48,103 --> 01:23:52,062
- They're gonna rip you off. Randy!
- They won't!

1501
01:23:52,207 --> 01:23:56,200
- You wanna fucking fight?
- Mr. Lahey. just go!

1502
01:23:56,345 --> 01:23:58,404
- Oh my. Jesus. Look over there.

1503
01:23:58,547 --> 01:24:01,175
- Mr. Lahe...

1504
01:24:01,316 --> 01:24:02,749
Julian. come in.

1505
01:24:11,059 --> 01:24:13,254
Fuck. fuck. fuck. fuck. fuck!

1506
01:24:15,163 --> 01:24:17,358
- Guys. get the fuck out of here!
Are you crazy?

1507
01:24:17,499 --> 01:24:20,593
Oh. Mr. Lahey... Fuck!

1508
01:24:20,736 --> 01:24:22,499
Fuck. Lahey. you can't...

1509
01:24:22,637 --> 01:24:25,105
- Guys. guys. It's just a drunk guy.
We know him.

1510
01:24:25,240 --> 01:24:27,504
He's in love with. uh... our driver.

1511
01:24:27,642 --> 01:24:29,633
Oh. fuck! What the fuck are you guys
doing here!

1512
01:24:29,778 --> 01:24:31,769
Just a documentary crew doing a show
about our work.

1513
01:24:31,913 --> 01:24:33,847
but you're not supposed to follow us
out here.

1514
01:24:33,982 --> 01:24:36,212
I told you to stay the fuck outside.
Stay back. guys.

1515
01:24:36,351 --> 01:24:38,148
Seriously. we got this.
Thank you for your response.

1516
01:24:38,286 --> 01:24:40,413
- How dare you let Randy...
- Things are getting fucky here.

1517
01:24:40,555 --> 01:24:42,420
- ... get involved
in your little shit fever.

1518
01:24:42,557 --> 01:24:47,221
- Jim. you are out of line right now.
Do you want to see Randy go to jail?

1519
01:24:47,362 --> 01:24:49,887
- That's why I'm here!
I don't wanna see Randy go to jail.

1520
01:24:50,031 --> 01:24:53,296
And I don't wanna see you go to jail
either. Julian. 'cause I love you.

1521
01:24:53,435 --> 01:24:56,302
- I fucking love you too. Jim.
All right?

1522
01:24:56,438 --> 01:24:58,167
Let's talk about this back at the park.

1523
01:24:58,306 --> 01:24:59,568
- What did you say?

1524
01:24:59,708 --> 01:25:02,404
- Let's talk about this back--
- Tsst. before that.

1525
01:25:02,544 --> 01:25:05,138
- Yeah. the other thing.

1526
01:25:06,415 --> 01:25:08,007
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1527
01:25:09,384 --> 01:25:11,079
- I knew it all along.

1528
01:25:15,223 --> 01:25:17,282
- There's a lot of fucking rumours
going around the park

1529
01:25:17,426 --> 01:25:18,859
about you loving Randy.
you taking Randy--

1530
01:25:18,994 --> 01:25:21,258
- What are you talking--
- You just told him you love him!

1531
01:25:21,396 --> 01:25:24,024
- I just did that to get him
the fuck out of here!

1532
01:25:24,166 --> 01:25:26,828
- Okay. Let's get out of here. then.
- Stay calm.

1533
01:25:26,968 --> 01:25:28,629
- I heard that. Julian.

1534
01:25:31,206 --> 01:25:32,730
I heard that...

1535
01:25:33,742 --> 01:25:35,676
You didn't actually think
he loved you?

1536
01:25:37,345 --> 01:25:38,972
- Hey. bud? Going up?
- Whoa!

1537
01:25:51,126 --> 01:25:52,388
- Julian!

1538
01:25:54,029 --> 01:25:55,360
I'm afraid. help me!

1539
01:25:55,497 --> 01:25:57,021
Oh. my fuck!

1540
01:25:57,165 --> 01:26:00,464
- Julian! I'm gonna jump.
and it's all your fault!

1541
01:26:01,002 --> 01:26:02,162
- Jim!

1542
01:26:02,304 --> 01:26:03,896
Keep calm!

1543
01:26:04,039 --> 01:26:05,904
- What the fuck is wrong with you!

1544
01:26:06,041 --> 01:26:07,872
Why do you always gotta
follow us around.

1545
01:26:08,009 --> 01:26:10,603
and keep fucking us around like this!?

1546
01:26:10,745 --> 01:26:12,406
- I'm sexy. aren't I?

1547
01:26:12,547 --> 01:26:15,744
I'm a lot more sexy than Randy.
and you know that.

1548
01:26:15,884 --> 01:26:17,818
Randy?

1549
01:26:17,953 --> 01:26:20,148
Julian said he loved me.

1550
01:26:20,288 --> 01:26:22,279
But he was lying. don't trust him.

1551
01:26:22,424 --> 01:26:24,585
He was lying. and I'm flying!

1552
01:26:24,726 --> 01:26:27,991
- Boys. what are we gonna do?
He's gonna fucking jump!

1553
01:26:28,129 --> 01:26:29,824
- He's not gonna jump.
- Jim!

1554
01:26:29,965 --> 01:26:32,229
I do love you. but just as a friend!

1555
01:26:32,367 --> 01:26:35,393
- Not enough. Julian! Not enough.
- Guys...

1556
01:26:35,537 --> 01:26:37,732
He's gonna jump.
- Good luck. buddies.

1557
01:26:37,873 --> 01:26:39,773
Here's a little drinky-poo for you!

1558
01:26:39,908 --> 01:26:42,103
Have a good life. shit weasel!

1559
01:26:42,244 --> 01:26:43,370
- Julian. if he jumps.

1560
01:26:43,512 --> 01:26:45,810
that's gonna be on your head.
- He's not gonna jump.

1561
01:26:45,947 --> 01:26:47,778
He's looking for attention.
And we're millionaires now.

1562
01:26:47,916 --> 01:26:50,111
We don't go up.
and fucking save drunken lunatics--

1563
01:26:50,252 --> 01:26:53,619
Guys. guys! He's gonna jump!
- I'm gonna go up. and talk to him.

1564
01:26:53,755 --> 01:26:55,950
Wait in the van for four minutes.
If I'm not back.

1565
01:26:56,091 --> 01:26:57,683
head back to Sunnyvale.
I'll meet you there.

1566
01:26:57,826 --> 01:27:00,294
- Are you fucking kidding me?
You really are in love with him.

1567
01:27:00,428 --> 01:27:02,259
- I'm not... fucking in love with him.

1568
01:27:02,397 --> 01:27:05,298
- Get in the van. This is unbelievable.
I hope you're fucking happy about this.

1569
01:27:05,433 --> 01:27:07,492
Get the fuck in the van. In the van.
- Wait...

1570
01:27:13,408 --> 01:27:14,670
- Jim!

1571
01:27:16,311 --> 01:27:17,608
- Hi. Julian.

1572
01:27:19,180 --> 01:27:21,045
- What are you doin'?

1573
01:27:21,783 --> 01:27:23,410
- Randy told me.

1574
01:27:23,552 --> 01:27:25,417
He said that you and him were dating.

1575
01:27:25,554 --> 01:27:28,955
- We're not dating.
He's just workin' for me.

1576
01:27:30,292 --> 01:27:32,385
- So. you don't love him?
- No!

1577
01:27:33,595 --> 01:27:35,290
- Say you love me. Julian.

1578
01:27:35,931 --> 01:27:38,764
Just tell me one time
before I jump.

1579
01:27:39,701 --> 01:27:40,963
Lie to me.

1580
01:27:42,237 --> 01:27:43,829
- I can't.

1581
01:27:43,972 --> 01:27:46,202
- Is there ever a chance
that you could love me?

1582
01:27:46,708 --> 01:27:47,868
- No.

1583
01:27:49,544 --> 01:27:52,775
Hurry the fuck up!
We've got two minutes!

1584
01:27:54,549 --> 01:27:56,813
- The bottle's empty. Julian.

1585
01:27:56,952 --> 01:27:58,749
I'm flying out of here!

1586
01:27:58,887 --> 01:28:00,218
- Wait!

1587
01:28:01,957 --> 01:28:04,255
Just one more drink...

1588
01:28:04,392 --> 01:28:06,417
out of my glass before you go.

1589
01:28:11,566 --> 01:28:13,534
- Thanks. Julian.

1590
01:28:17,305 --> 01:28:18,795
My last drink.

1591
01:28:20,809 --> 01:28:22,709
I finally did it! I quit drinking!

1592
01:28:26,448 --> 01:28:28,848
Julian... Julian. you tricked me!

1593
01:28:30,285 --> 01:28:32,310
Oh... Holy shit!

1594
01:28:32,454 --> 01:28:36,049
- Gimme that.
- Listen. why didn't you let me jump?

1595
01:28:36,191 --> 01:28:38,284
- Just shut the fuck up!
- What are you talking about?

1596
01:28:38,426 --> 01:28:39,654
You love me. don't you!

1597
01:28:39,794 --> 01:28:43,059
- We're doing a robbery right now.
You take this. you gotta stay calm.

1598
01:28:43,198 --> 01:28:44,631
Act normal.

1599
01:28:44,766 --> 01:28:46,597
- No problem. Julian.

1600
01:28:47,335 --> 01:28:50,304
Act normal. right?

1601
01:28:55,477 --> 01:28:57,672
- What is he doin'?

1602
01:28:58,980 --> 01:29:00,777
- What the fuck. boys! Just go!

1603
01:29:02,017 --> 01:29:04,850
- All right. put this on.
and get the fuck out of here.

1604
01:29:04,986 --> 01:29:08,513
- Julian. I got something
in my underwear I want you to see.

1605
01:29:08,657 --> 01:29:10,284
- What?
- It's a contract.

1606
01:29:10,425 --> 01:29:12,325
You're gonna sign it
before you go anywhere.

1607
01:29:12,460 --> 01:29:14,428
- Randy. get out here
and deal with this.

1608
01:29:14,562 --> 01:29:16,621
- You promise?
- No time for underwear contracts.

1609
01:29:16,765 --> 01:29:19,700
We need to leave.
Holy shit. guys... Good luck.

1610
01:29:19,834 --> 01:29:21,301
- Money cops...
- Stop right there!

1611
01:29:21,436 --> 01:29:23,301
- Stay calm.
- Don't worry. they're dumb.

1612
01:29:23,438 --> 01:29:25,338
- They're gonna shoot.
- No. they're not gonna shoot.

1613
01:29:25,473 --> 01:29:26,804
- Stop!
- Let's all relax. guys!

1614
01:29:26,941 --> 01:29:30,604
Okay. let's smoke a big joint.
I got some really nice hash right here.

1615
01:29:36,451 --> 01:29:38,817
- A camera marker.
- What the fuck are you doing?!

1616
01:29:38,953 --> 01:29:41,717
Go to your van!
We need cover over here! Help us!

1617
01:29:41,856 --> 01:29:44,586
Are you okay? It's just a fat wound.

1618
01:29:44,726 --> 01:29:47,490
- Don't let me die. Ricky.
- You're not gonna die.

1619
01:29:47,629 --> 01:29:49,597
Stay low.

1620
01:29:49,731 --> 01:29:52,564
- Okay. okay...
- Get him in the van! Hurry up!

1621
01:29:52,834 --> 01:29:58,363
- Come on. Randy.
We gotta go! We gotta go!

1622
01:30:05,547 --> 01:30:08,983
- Just drive normal. Julian. Don't do
anything to draw attention to us.

1623
01:30:09,117 --> 01:30:10,744
Come on. get us out of here.

1624
01:30:10,885 --> 01:30:12,182
- I don't hear any cops.

1625
01:30:13,988 --> 01:30:16,115
- Fuck. it's Lahey.

1626
01:30:16,257 --> 01:30:18,122
- Pull over! I wanna take Randy
to the hospital!

1627
01:30:18,259 --> 01:30:19,783
- It's just a fat wound!

1628
01:30:19,928 --> 01:30:21,896
Get the fuck out of here!
- Randy. are you okay?

1629
01:30:25,967 --> 01:30:28,299
- Come on!
- Give it some gas!

1630
01:30:28,436 --> 01:30:30,768
What are you doing?

1631
01:30:30,905 --> 01:30:32,566
What are you doing?

1632
01:30:32,707 --> 01:30:35,676
- Ricky... let me do this.
Ricky. I'm gonna be ruined.

1633
01:30:35,810 --> 01:30:38,643
- You just get back in the car.
- You don't have no idea.

1634
01:30:38,780 --> 01:30:41,647
If I don't get the fucking
sewer line in. I lose everything.

1635
01:30:41,783 --> 01:30:44,946
- This is what has to happen right now.
because you're fucking everything up.

1636
01:30:45,086 --> 01:30:48,317
Go to a bar. have a couple of drinks.
leave us alone. please!

1637
01:30:48,456 --> 01:30:50,788
- Ricky...
- There. You can't have it signed now.

1638
01:30:50,925 --> 01:30:53,587
- We're on now. bud.
- I'm in charge of...

1639
01:30:53,728 --> 01:30:55,457
- I'll be ahead of you.

1640
01:30:55,597 --> 01:30:57,997
- Stay away from us.
- You can't run far enough.

1641
01:30:58,133 --> 01:31:01,694
You can't run fast enough.
You guys are fucked.

1642
01:31:01,836 --> 01:31:04,100
- I'm in charge now.
We're the fuck out of here.

1643
01:31:17,018 --> 01:31:19,213
- Fuck off. leave us alone!

1644
01:31:24,492 --> 01:31:26,392
What the fuck are you doing?!

1645
01:31:26,528 --> 01:31:28,723
- How you doin'. Ricky!
I'm livin' the dream. bud!

1646
01:31:28,863 --> 01:31:31,354
Shit... I'm livin' the dream.

1647
01:31:31,499 --> 01:31:34,730
But first. I gotta take a little piss.

1648
01:31:41,209 --> 01:31:42,904
- Get us out of his piss arc!

1649
01:31:43,044 --> 01:31:44,739
- You wanna start a little piss war.
Lahey?

1650
01:31:44,879 --> 01:31:47,313
Go ahead. piss on us!

1651
01:31:47,448 --> 01:31:49,939
I'm going to piss on him. Julian.
Take the wheel.

1652
01:31:50,084 --> 01:31:52,609
- What? Ricky!

1653
01:31:54,522 --> 01:31:57,719
- Boys. the cops are behind us.
I'm not stoppin'. I'm not stopping.

1654
01:31:57,859 --> 01:31:59,759
- Speed it up!

1655
01:32:01,830 --> 01:32:03,559
Pull up to him. Bubbles! Steady it!

1656
01:32:03,698 --> 01:32:05,461
- Ricky. what the fuck are you doing?

1657
01:32:07,001 --> 01:32:08,366
- Shit!

1658
01:32:11,806 --> 01:32:13,433
Oh. fuck! Ricky!

1659
01:32:17,478 --> 01:32:19,742
I'm gonna work up
another fucking piss. Ricky!

1660
01:32:19,881 --> 01:32:21,576
You're in fucking shit.

1661
01:32:21,716 --> 01:32:23,877
Gimme that fucking bottle.
you son of a bitch!

1662
01:32:24,018 --> 01:32:25,952
- Look what you've done!

1663
01:32:28,022 --> 01:32:31,685
- Mr. Lahey. I'm not going to make it!
Take the money!

1664
01:32:31,826 --> 01:32:34,488
- What the fuck?!
- See you in jail. boys!

1665
01:32:36,197 --> 01:32:37,926
- Hey. camera dicks. look out!

1666
01:32:51,412 --> 01:32:53,277
Sorry. boys. I rolled her.

1667
01:32:55,149 --> 01:32:56,241
- Ah!

1668
01:32:56,384 --> 01:32:57,851
- Oh. cock!

1669
01:33:02,056 --> 01:33:04,081
- All right. everybody
just fucking relax here. okay?

1670
01:33:04,225 --> 01:33:06,785
It's just a big misunderstanding.
there's a guy... Fuck off!

1671
01:33:06,928 --> 01:33:09,453
There's a guy in his underwear
that's fucking around peeing on people.

1672
01:33:09,597 --> 01:33:11,656
- Easy! Ah!

1673
01:33:11,799 --> 01:33:15,360
- Let go of my drink.
- This is fucking too much.

1674
01:33:15,503 --> 01:33:17,937
You can't do this kind of shit
to regular people like us.

1675
01:33:18,072 --> 01:33:20,472
It's the guy in the underwear you want!
Not us!

1676
01:33:20,608 --> 01:33:22,166
Fucking Jesus...

1677
01:33:22,310 --> 01:33:25,177
We didn't even cause this. guys.
We didn't even cause this.

1678
01:33:25,313 --> 01:33:26,940
- Okay. boys.

1679
01:33:27,081 --> 01:33:30,209
I'm arresting you for robbery.
resisting arrest.

1680
01:33:30,351 --> 01:33:32,080
public urination...

1681
01:33:32,220 --> 01:33:34,450
- Who the fuck is that?

1682
01:33:34,589 --> 01:33:36,853
Oh. my fuck! It's you!

1683
01:33:36,991 --> 01:33:38,515
- What are you talking about?

1684
01:33:38,660 --> 01:33:40,787
- You're the fucking undercover
drunk male prostitute!

1685
01:33:40,929 --> 01:33:44,228
- Grand larceny. public intoxication...
- You are fucking drunk right now.

1686
01:33:44,365 --> 01:33:46,731
- Will you stop it...
- This guy's drunk.

1687
01:33:46,868 --> 01:33:48,631
He's reading us our rights
fucking drunk.

1688
01:33:48,770 --> 01:33:50,067
- Reckless endangerment.
- Who's drunk?

1689
01:33:50,204 --> 01:33:52,229
- I want him checked.
- Smell him!

1690
01:33:52,373 --> 01:33:54,739
- Do the breath thing to him.
You know he's fucked up.

1691
01:33:54,876 --> 01:33:56,605
- No. I'm not drunk.
- Yes. you're drunk.

1692
01:33:56,744 --> 01:33:59,212
- This is gonna be good for our fucking
hearing tomorrow.

1693
01:33:59,347 --> 01:34:01,178
- I told you I'm not drunk!
- Hey!

1694
01:34:01,316 --> 01:34:02,749
- I had one lousy drink!

1695
01:34:02,884 --> 01:34:04,351
- Yeah. buddy!
- It's not our fault!

1696
01:34:04,485 --> 01:34:06,316
It's this documentary crew!
Look at this guy!

1697
01:34:06,454 --> 01:34:08,285
With the microphone in his hand!
Somebody arrest...

1698
01:34:08,423 --> 01:34:10,152
- And this fucking camera dick.
right here!

1699
01:34:10,291 --> 01:34:12,657
You fucking guys caused this accident.

1700
01:34:12,794 --> 01:34:14,785
- We didn't do shit! We didn't do shit!

1701
01:34:14,929 --> 01:34:18,262
- What the fuck is this van right here?
You caused the fucking accident!

1702
01:34:18,399 --> 01:34:19,923
Told you not to come in the bank.

1703
01:34:37,218 --> 01:34:38,776
- I don't know if you heard the news.

1704
01:34:38,920 --> 01:34:41,445
but we're getting out of here in
like two weeks. they fucked up:

1705
01:34:41,589 --> 01:34:43,557
the arresting officer was drunk.
which we can prove now.

1706
01:34:43,691 --> 01:34:45,852
And our lawyer said
we got a really really good chance.

1707
01:34:45,994 --> 01:34:48,087
So. I guess we'll see you guys
in two weeks.

1708
01:34:48,229 --> 01:34:51,858
But I recommend not following us around
if you know what I mean.

1709
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,195
- Yeah. guys. when we get out
in two weeks. could you...

1710
01:34:54,335 --> 01:34:57,429
please fuck off with the cameras.
Please?

1711
01:34:57,572 --> 01:35:00,132
Yes. I created
a programme called

1712
01:35:00,274 --> 01:35:02,333
Cats For Inmates.

1713
01:35:02,477 --> 01:35:05,037
I contacted the jail outreach programme.

1714
01:35:05,179 --> 01:35:08,580
and we are able to bring in a bunch
of cats from the shelter

1715
01:35:08,716 --> 01:35:10,707
to come and play
with the people in jail.

1716
01:35:10,852 --> 01:35:15,585
And. yeahI It's been this huge success.
I hear. you know?

1717
01:35:15,723 --> 01:35:18,487
Apparently. there's been
a lot more cooperation

1718
01:35:18,626 --> 01:35:20,093
amongst the inmates.

1719
01:35:20,228 --> 01:35:22,492
and they're really enjoying their time
with the cats.

1720
01:35:22,630 --> 01:35:24,689
I know. I... I'm really happy about it.

1721
01:35:28,503 --> 01:35:31,563
- Jenny's just a fantastic girl.

1722
01:35:32,373 --> 01:35:34,807
She said she's gonna wait for me
to get out of jail.

1723
01:35:34,942 --> 01:35:37,934
and she wants to go on a date.

1724
01:35:38,079 --> 01:35:41,947
So. I might. I don't know if she...
wants to be my girlfriend or not.

1725
01:35:42,083 --> 01:35:44,108
but... I'm thinking I'd like that.

1726
01:35:49,323 --> 01:35:50,950
- It's healing up pretty good. eh?

1727
01:35:51,092 --> 01:35:52,923
- No one knows
what happened to Mr. Lahey.

1728
01:35:53,061 --> 01:35:57,157
My guess is he's probably
just off hiding in the woods somewhere.

1729
01:36:11,746 --> 01:36:13,680
- What's liquor without the love?

1730
01:36:13,815 --> 01:36:15,442
A glass of shit.

1731
01:36:30,998 --> 01:36:33,330
Can I get another drink here. please?

1732
01:36:36,938 --> 01:36:38,667
- Today. on MTV News.

1733
01:36:38,806 --> 01:36:40,797
major developments
in the Canadian rap scene.

1734
01:36:40,942 --> 01:36:42,910
How did a completely unknown MC

1735
01:36:43,044 --> 01:36:45,638
go from playing video dances
for $30 a night

1736
01:36:45,780 --> 01:36:47,839
to five sold-out shows at Massey Hall.

1737
01:36:47,982 --> 01:36:50,314
and a major label bidding war
on his back catalogue

1738
01:36:50,451 --> 01:36:53,352
of 14 previously unreleased albums?

1739
01:36:54,122 --> 01:36:56,750
With 16 years of determination.
and never giving up on his dream.

1740
01:36:56,891 --> 01:37:00,122
No matter how tough it got.
J-Roc never dropped the mic.

1741
01:37:00,261 --> 01:37:01,785
I met up with him in Toronto

1742
01:37:01,929 --> 01:37:04,796
on the release of his new single.
Can't Not Be Feeling This.

1743
01:37:05,666 --> 01:37:08,658
So congratulations on all your success.
this is very big news for you.

1744
01:37:08,803 --> 01:37:11,271
- It is big. dog.
What's your name again?

1745
01:37:11,405 --> 01:37:12,633
- Aliya-Jasmine.

1746
01:37:12,773 --> 01:37:15,640
You know what I'm sayin'?
Thank you. Aliya-Jasmills.

1747
01:37:15,776 --> 01:37:18,836
- You know. there's a lot of label buzz
about you. right now.

1748
01:37:18,980 --> 01:37:20,743
The industry's talking about you.

1749
01:37:20,882 --> 01:37:24,113
Hum. but I understand
it's also bittersweet for you.

1750
01:37:24,252 --> 01:37:26,083
- Let me get something straight. dog.

1751
01:37:26,220 --> 01:37:27,915
Straighter than them big.
long getaway sticks.

1752
01:37:28,055 --> 01:37:30,546
I wanna be very clear
about one thing. dog.

1753
01:37:30,691 --> 01:37:33,819
My new record's called
Get My DJ Out Of Jail.

1754
01:37:33,961 --> 01:37:35,792
And that ain't exploitin'.
know what I'm saying?

1755
01:37:35,930 --> 01:37:38,763
Because he is in jail right now.
you know what I'm sayin'?

1756
01:37:38,900 --> 01:37:40,595
That's just the reality of my troops.

1757
01:37:40,735 --> 01:37:44,227
- What exactly happened to you DJ?
- I don't wanna give away the specifics.

1758
01:37:44,372 --> 01:37:45,964
Suffice to say. dog.

1759
01:37:46,107 --> 01:37:48,974
he did some robberization.

1760
01:37:49,110 --> 01:37:51,237
And some B&Es. Yeah!

1761
01:37:51,379 --> 01:37:54,940
He ain't gone away forever. dog.
And he did it for a good reason.

1762
01:37:55,082 --> 01:37:57,983
Which I won't... I'm not at...
legal liberty to say

1763
01:37:58,119 --> 01:38:01,555
what exactly he was doin' up in there.
but he's gonna be out soon.

1764
01:38:01,689 --> 01:38:05,056
And when he's out. he's gonna taste
the champagnes with me.

1765
01:38:05,193 --> 01:38:07,923
T. this is for you and me. dog.

1766
01:38:08,062 --> 01:38:10,394
If you're watching from up in there.
pound it.

1767
01:38:12,366 --> 01:38:15,301
Hands up. let's go!
Put your hands up!

1768
01:38:15,436 --> 01:38:18,303
Oh. yeah! Yeah!

01:38:18,439 --> 01:38:20,339
Put your hands up. yo!

1770
01:38:20,474 --> 01:38:22,772
Can't not be feeling this
J-Roc's got the quickness

1771
01:38:22,910 --> 01:38:25,902
Can't not be feeling this
Like a shorty with the thickness

1772
01:38:26,047 --> 01:38:28,914
We've been over this

1777
01:38:37,558 --> 01:38:39,719
'Cause you can't not

1778
01:38:39,860 --> 01:38:41,589
Hey yo can I get a witness

1779
01:38:41,729 --> 01:38:44,163
One of you all to testify
Who the dopest MC is

1780
01:38:44,298 --> 01:38:46,459
You want a hint
You might want to consider this

1781
01:38:46,601 --> 01:38:49,069
Played out all your ladies
And I'm still harder than calculus

Well I'm howling for my baby

1829
01:41:10,311 --> 01:41:12,506
Standing in the rain

1830
01:41:15,349 --> 01:41:19,080
Yes I'm howling for my baby

1831

People ain't this a shame

1832
01:41:23,991 --> 01:41:27,392
Well she left a note
Hanging on the door

1833
01:41:27,528 --> 01:41:30,497
Said I don't wanna see you anymore

1834
01:41:30,631 --> 01:41:34,761
And the rain fell down on my head

1835
01:41:34,902 --> 01:41:36,961
Said open the door babe

1836
01:41:39,340 --> 01:41:41,865
And let me in

1837
01:41:44,178 --> 01:41:47,204
