00:01:02,893 --> 00:01:03,893
Uh!

("Choking On A Marshmallow" fades)

5
00:01:33,903 --> 00:01:36,343
Did you enter your weight?
It is important

6
00:01:36,464 --> 00:01:39,384
that you set the super-Stairmaster
individual. . . Set it, individually,

7
00:01:39,505 --> 00:01:41,225
because of the injury risk.

8
00:01:42,467 --> 00:01:45,186
My name is Gunther. And you?

9
00:01:46,668 --> 00:01:47,667
Mine not.

("Choking On A Marshmallow"

11
00:01:56,591 --> 00:02:00,471
Yes, a lot of fun. I already have ...

12
00:02:04,274 --> 00:02:08,153
Sorry. Could I perhaps
Also use the "Wide Chest Press"?

13
00:02:08,274 --> 00:02:10,035
You sit here so dreamy.

14
00:02:10,155 --> 00:02:11,555
And I still did not today. ..

15
00:02:11,676 --> 00:02:14,195
(Wild cry)

16
00:02:14,876 --> 00:02:18,117
P. . Otherwise, I just come. ..
Again later...

17
00:02:18,238 --> 00:02:21,758
(More threatening, strained sounds)

(More sounds in the background)

19
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,680
That is completely idiotic here.

20
00:02:27,801 --> 00:02:31,201
Imagine that from the
perspective of outer space.

21
00:02:31,322 --> 00:02:33,241
What are we doing here?

22
00:02:33,363 --> 00:02:34,882
Totally insane.

23
00:02:35,004 --> 00:02:36,443
The fact that people spend money for it!

24
00:02:36,564 --> 00:02:38,564
We are NOT paying any money,

25
00:02:38,685 --> 00:02:41,445
because I'm doing the campaign for them
if I may remind you.

26
00:02:42,205 --> 00:02:45,286
- Now another 3 sets of leg curls.
- Is there really anything in life,

27
00:02:45,407 --> 00:02:46,926
that you do not plan?

28
00:03:02,332 --> 00:03:04,052
Thanks again for earlier.

29
00:03:04,453 --> 00:03:05,692
Ah, don't mention it.

30
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:11,574
- By the way - I am Guenther.
- Jerome.

31
00:03:11,695 --> 00:03:12,935
Nice name.

32
00:03:13,055 --> 00:03:14,175
- Yes?
- Hm.

33
00:03:14,296 --> 00:03:16,055
Gunther is not bad either.

34
00:03:16,176 --> 00:03:18,376
You can pull The headband off.
I think_ here..

35
00:03:18,498 --> 00:03:21,057
Hm? Oh.

36
00:03:22,258 --> 00:03:24,259
Suppose, Jerome,

37
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:26,619
you have your first date with a woman.

38
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:29,020
Where will you go to?

39
00:03:30,022 --> 00:03:31,501
Well, to my place.

40
00:03:32,942 --> 00:03:35,182
Yes, ok, but I mean,
date technical wise....

41
00:03:35,303 --> 00:03:37,302
- date technical wise.
- Yes.

42
00:03:37,424 --> 00:03:41,104
Ts. . Well, anything which
has a number in its name.

43
00:03:41,225 --> 00:03:44,225
Bar 23, 1 000, 1 03.

44
00:03:45,667 --> 00:03:46,785
Cool.

45

("Choking On A Marshmallow"
instrumental in the background)

46
00:04:05,192 --> 00:04:08,673
Philip, I do not want to keep
you in the dark any longer.

47
00:04:08,794 --> 00:04:11,034
You probably know what's next.

48
00:04:11,155 --> 00:04:15,155
Well, Mrs. Mack, I had of course
already few thoughts

49
00:04:15,276 --> 00:04:16,796
how we can convince as
many people as possible

50
00:04:17,717 --> 00:04:19,436
to become a Penguin godfather.

51
00:04:19,557 --> 00:04:22,237
I think we should be especially
focused on an online strategy.

52
00:04:22,358 --> 00:04:23,478
Philip. ..

53
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:27,279
I'm sorry, but
I'll have to let you go.

54
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:29,479
What you mean : go?
But I do not want to go..

55
00:04:30,881 --> 00:04:32,161
What will happen to the project management?

56
00:04:32,282 --> 00:04:33,761
Mr. Yokitashi will take over.

57
00:04:35,683 --> 00:04:39,403
I have known for weeks that we
can not afford two Interns.

58
00:04:39,524 --> 00:04:41,764
Mr. Yokitashi won the race.

59
00:04:41,885 --> 00:04:44,284
Yes, but Mr. Yokitashi
does not speak German properly even!

60
00:04:44,405 --> 00:04:48,286
But Mr. Yokitashi shows much
more motivation than you, Philip.

61
00:04:54,209 --> 00:04:58,969
You know, I see it positive.
This is a chance.

62
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:00,609
I will be working more on my
business plan in teh near future.

63
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:02,170
Business Plan.

64
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:03,691
"LIFE".

65
00:05:03,812 --> 00:05:05,971
For this eco-Mc. DUMB there?

66
00:05:06,092 --> 00:05:09,333
Shh, Nina, not so loud!
This is top secret!

67
00:05:10,694 --> 00:05:14,975
And if it works,
then I'll become real cool.

68
00:05:15,096 --> 00:05:17,375
Put on my Adiletten (shoes),
buy me a Boat

69
00:05:17,496 --> 00:05:20,456
and sail across the sea.
Just me and the wind.

70
00:05:20,577 --> 00:05:22,136
You can't even sail.

71
00:05:22,257 --> 00:05:23,697
So what? Then I just learn it.

72
00:05:24,178 --> 00:05:25,177
Yes!

73
00:05:25,298 --> 00:05:27,098
Tommi!

74
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:28,858
- Uah!
- Guys!

75
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:32,540
Why do you always have to fight,
Tommi? Why?

76
00:05:32,661 --> 00:05:33,820
Fight, Tommi fight!

77
00:05:33,941 --> 00:05:35,941
Yes, well, come on!

78
00:05:36,062 --> 00:05:37,542
(Coach) out of there!

79
00:05:39,784 --> 00:05:42,423
Yes! And now switch!
Back, back, back!

80
00:05:42,545 --> 00:05:44,544
Please calm down now, Roland.

81
00:05:44,665 --> 00:05:46,665
He will soon get another
red card.

82
00:05:47,306 --> 00:05:49,305
I still may cheer up my son,
may I?

83
00:05:49,547 --> 00:05:51,987
This is their relegation battle.

84
00:05:52,107 --> 00:05:53,587
Oh!

85
00:05:53,748 --> 00:05:55,308
(Trainer) Good, good, good!

86
00:05:56,589 --> 00:05:59,068
Just that you know it, Susie.
I will never accept divorce, never.

87
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,229
I will fight for us.

88
00:06:02,271 --> 00:06:04,270
But I do not want that you are fighting.

89
00:06:04,872 --> 00:06:06,351
How long will this go on?

90
00:06:06,472 --> 00:06:08,351
It's over! Finished!

91
00:06:08,473 --> 00:06:10,113
(Coach) shoot, shoot!

92
00:06:10,433 --> 00:06:12,673
Final whistle, do you understand?

93
00:06:15,555 --> 00:06:17,034
After the game is before the game.

94
00:06:17,996 --> 00:06:20,995
Go on, go, go! Holy crap!

95
00:06:21,116 --> 00:06:23,756
(Susanne) Tell me, my darling,
Why did you beat Marcus?

96
00:06:23,877 --> 00:06:26,757
You know,
that we should not beat anybody.

97
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,600
Marcus dragged Jasmin
by the hair.

98
00:06:36,682 --> 00:06:39,562
Aha. Who is Jasmine?

99
00:06:42,084 --> 00:06:43,563
She is new here.

100
00:06:54,327 --> 00:06:56,127
They look very lovely, Beatrice.

101
00:06:56,248 --> 00:07:00,729
And yet more charming
than on their online profil picture.

102
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:04,410
You look also good, Günther.

103
00:07:04,531 --> 00:07:05,770
(Laughs) Thank you.

104
00:07:08,293 --> 00:07:12,653
Did you know that today 25% of
all partnerships start online?

105
00:07:12,774 --> 00:07:14,933
For my mother, that's
still something strange, huh? '.

106
00:07:15,054 --> 00:07:16,974
Something wicked, dangerous, and so on.

107
00:07:17,095 --> 00:07:18,815
This is of course nonsense.

108
00:07:18,936 --> 00:07:20,295
It's not just perverts
in the internet.

109
00:07:20,416 --> 00:07:24,216
- Of course not.
- Although I did read something the other day.

110
00:07:24,338 --> 00:07:28,337
As it happened in Canada
a medical assistant and an architect

111
00:07:28,459 --> 00:07:31,139
met on "My Face"
and met also in person.

112
00:07:31,259 --> 00:07:34,580
And they fell in love..and so..
And as she stayed with him for the first time,

113
00:07:34,701 --> 00:07:37,020
he has tied her to his bed

114
00:07:37,141 --> 00:07:40,342
and sawed off her feet.
(Laughs gasping and sniffling)

115
00:07:41,263 --> 00:07:42,822
Yes, a foot fetishist.

116
00:07:44,944 --> 00:07:46,264
Terrible, 'right?

117
00:07:46,864 --> 00:07:48,864
You have to be on guard all the time.

118
00:07:48,985 --> 00:07:52,826
So, not that you think now that
I. . . So. . . I'm not a fetishist.

119
00:07:52,947 --> 00:07:56,107
I'm just a normal man,
I search a normal woman,

120
00:07:56,867 --> 00:07:59,188
- a totally normal relationship.
- (Cough)

121
00:08:00,109 --> 00:08:02,108
(Sipping drink)

122
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:05,470
Did I mention,

123
00:08:05,591 --> 00:08:08,231
that I am the second youngest commercial
regulatory official in Berlin-Brandenburg?

124
00:08:08,352 --> 00:08:10,432
Yes. It's in your flirting profile.

125
00:08:10,553 --> 00:08:12,032
Exactly.

126
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:15,993
Now we have
talked so much about me. ..

127
00:08:16,715 --> 00:08:19,154
I have so many questions, Beate.

128
00:08:19,275 --> 00:08:20,795
Do you like animals?

129
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:26,757
Excuse me, Guenther,
But somehow it does not work.

130
00:08:27,718 --> 00:08:28,717
What is it?

131
00:08:28,838 --> 00:08:30,798
That here with us.

132
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:38,641
I'm really sorry.

133
00:08:39,281 --> 00:08:41,001
Nope, is not a problem, I...

134
00:08:43,963 --> 00:08:48,443
(Soulful piano music)

135
00:08:52,806 --> 00:08:55,045
(Stops to play abruptly)

136
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:56,446
I've written for you, Tamara.

137
00:08:56,567 --> 00:08:57,806
Tatjana.

138
00:08:57,927 --> 00:09:00,728
Ah huh! Tatjana. Right.

139
00:09:00,849 --> 00:09:02,488
Ups. (Starts to play again)

140
00:09:02,609 --> 00:09:06,169
Oh! My song! (Sigh)

141
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:12,012
(Niklas) This man is free
of conventions, fears, doubts.

142
00:09:12,132 --> 00:09:16,373
No woman can put him in chains,
no enemy to stop him.

143
00:09:16,494 --> 00:09:19,374
This man
is an urban jungle warrior.

144
00:09:19,495 --> 00:09:21,215
Always looking for adventure,

145
00:09:21,336 --> 00:09:23,575
always in fight-
and sexual readiness.

146
00:09:24,536 --> 00:09:27,016
He enjoys life to the fullest.

147
00:09:27,137 --> 00:09:29,777
And. . . No matter what will happen

148
00:09:29,898 --> 00:09:32,618
this man
is determined on his path.

149
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:37,260
The path to his masculine truth.

150
00:09:38,821 --> 00:09:41,461
And along the way he uses
her eye cream, shaving cream, deodorant,

151
00:09:41,582 --> 00:09:44,301
Shampoo, toilet water, peeling,
Anti-wrinkle cream. ..

152
00:09:45,143 --> 00:09:49,023
The complete skin care line.

153
00:09:49,144 --> 00:09:50,343
(Applause)

154
00:09:52,185 --> 00:09:55,185
Do you know why you are
fascinating me, Nicholas?

155
00:09:55,306 --> 00:09:59,307
They create all these daredevils
these wild adventurers.

156
00:10:00,028 --> 00:10:03,108
And you're more like ...
..like the Glöckle-Man (a soft egg).

157
00:10:03,229 --> 00:10:06,709
Solid through and through.
As in the 50s.

158
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:09,390
All according to plan.
Please do not get me wrong.

159
00:10:09,511 --> 00:10:11,310
I think that's great.

160
00:10:11,432 --> 00:10:13,831
The normality
is the true revolution.

161
00:10:13,952 --> 00:10:16,672
Well, if you
found the right one, than...

162
00:10:16,793 --> 00:10:19,033
Well, you just do me a favor

163
00:10:19,154 --> 00:10:21,714
and you do not take too long
off for your honeymoon in September.

164
00:10:21,835 --> 00:10:23,075
I need you here.

165
00:10:24,396 --> 00:10:26,596

(Priest) And so I ask you,
Niklas Michalke,

168
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,520
do you want to be a loving and
faithful husband to Laura Sandner,

169
00:10:39,641 --> 00:10:40,640
till death do you part?

170
00:10:40,761 --> 00:10:43,721
Are you really prepared to restrict
your sexual energy...

171
00:10:43,842 --> 00:10:47,763
To a single vagina, and
always on the same pair of breasts?

172
00:10:47,884 --> 00:10:50,403
Where "always the same pair" is put
very optimistically, Niklas.

173
00:10:50,525 --> 00:10:53,244
We all know what the force of gravity
can do.

174
00:10:54,846 --> 00:10:58,526
- Answer the priest, Nik.
- Are you one of those whiners,

175
00:10:58,647 --> 00:11:02,567
who get the total crisis with 40
and try to repeat their youth?

176
00:11:02,688 --> 00:11:04,728
What kind of man are you?

177
00:11:04,849 --> 00:11:07,569
(All in unison) What kind of man are you?

178
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:11,690
(Panting heavily)

179
00:11:12,131 --> 00:11:14,131
(Sighs.

180
00:11:14,252 --> 00:11:16,252
Everything ok, honey?

181
00:11:16,773 --> 00:11:18,012
Yes.

182
00:11:18,813 --> 00:11:20,053
I had a nightmare.

183
00:11:20,173 --> 00:11:21,973
What kind of a nightmare?

184
00:11:25,376 --> 00:11:27,696
Anything. . . With nasty monsters.

If I make you louder

I will get the feedback circuits

What do you want?
I produced the fucking soap opera

Girlie-band. Now we're even.

Hm?

Bruce Berger album, you understand?

- The whole fucking album.
- I thought.

(Questioning) Ok. ..

00:20:05,265 --> 00:20:07,745
Throughout the day there's seafood buffet
and Tommi can go snorkeling!

321
00:20:07,865 --> 00:20:10,745
If we are a while together,
You will see, I am a new person.

322
00:20:11,467 --> 00:20:13,466
Roli, you have to look forward.

323
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:14,987
Eventually you will
meet a new wife and...

324
00:20:15,108 --> 00:20:17,307
- (Roars) I do not want a new woman!
- You're hurting me!

325
00:20:17,428 --> 00:20:18,908
All right, Mrs. Feldberg?

326
00:20:19,669 --> 00:20:21,549
- What are you doing, Batman?
- (Groans)

327
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:23,629
(Loud clang)

328
00:20:27,872 --> 00:20:29,592
Susi, I'm sorry,
I did not want...

329
00:20:29,713 --> 00:20:32,193
If you do not immediately disappear,
I call the police.

330
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:33,913
I swear, Roland, I'll do it.

331
00:20:36,474 --> 00:20:41,636
Look, Tommy, you have to learn that
you must not always beat others.

332
00:20:47,998 --> 00:20:50,278
Marcus is just jealous.

333
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:58,361
Being in love is the most beautiful
thing in the world.

334
00:20:59,242 --> 00:21:00,722
One is proud of it.

335
00:21:07,484 --> 00:21:09,485
Nina?

336
00:21:13,126 --> 00:21:15,687
I did simply respond
like an idiot.

337
00:21:15,808 --> 00:21:18,688
If you want the child,
then. . . I will support you.

338
00:21:20,089 --> 00:21:23,689
Wow. You support me? From what?

339
00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:25,770
My God, Philip,
you're still yourself a child.

340
00:21:25,891 --> 00:21:28,571
I begin in the fall
with the graphic designer training. ..

341
00:21:28,692 --> 00:21:31,692
If we are honest,
we both don't want a child.

342
00:21:32,773 --> 00:21:33,773
Now.

343
00:21:34,614 --> 00:21:37,013
I've got an important event
planned for next week.

344
00:21:37,134 --> 00:21:38,534
In the clinic Schultheis.

345
00:21:38,655 --> 00:21:40,895
It is simply the most sensible.

346
00:21:42,936 --> 00:21:44,655
Niklas has explained everything to you, right?

347
00:21:44,777 --> 00:21:47,497
Yes, that's a campaign for Berlin.

348
00:21:47,618 --> 00:21:49,538
For. . . Berlin. Exactly.

349
00:21:50,739 --> 00:21:53,219
Should I do anything in particular?
A pose, or something?

350
00:21:53,339 --> 00:21:55,379
Nah, stay just the same.
This is perfectly ok.

351
00:22:04,103 --> 00:22:05,583
Niklas, I must come in.

352
00:22:05,704 --> 00:22:07,983
Ah, I am sitting on the toilet.

353
00:22:08,105 --> 00:22:09,544
I just need quickly
my contact lens solution.

354
00:22:09,665 --> 00:22:12,504
Laura, believe me,
you don't want to come in..

355
00:22:12,626 --> 00:22:14,345
(irritated sound)

356
00:22:14,466 --> 00:22:15,946
Look what I found.

357
00:22:17,268 --> 00:22:19,067
Do you remember?

358
00:22:19,188 --> 00:22:21,068
The crocodile you stole from
the fat Italian boy...

359
00:22:21,189 --> 00:22:23,668
Because I said,
I would also like to have one.

360
00:22:23,789 --> 00:22:27,030
How could I forget? I have
been almost killed by the Mafia.

361
00:22:39,274 --> 00:22:41,275
- Listen. ..
- Hm?

362
00:22:41,395 --> 00:22:43,395
Did you actually today
already take the pill?

363
00:22:44,957 --> 00:22:47,877
What's that now suddenly
for a stupid question?

364
00:22:47,998 --> 00:22:49,997
Just because your friend does not know
how to use condoms,

365
00:22:50,118 --> 00:22:52,358
- You panic now, or what?
- Oh, nonsense!

366
00:22:52,479 --> 00:22:55,239
Laura!
Oh, now make no drama out of it.

367
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,159
Here. Now you can do a
daily check.

368
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,520
I'll not mess up
your life plan.

369
00:23:00,202 --> 00:23:02,682
Although I honestly do not know
why I still take those.

370
00:23:02,802 --> 00:23:05,202
When was the last time we had sex?
In the Bronze Age?

371
00:23:05,323 --> 00:23:07,203
You, perhaps we would have more sex
If you would not constantly

372
00:23:07,324 --> 00:23:09,684
wear those stupid baggy pants,
as soon as you get home.

373
00:23:15,006 --> 00:23:17,406
Why do you not tell me just
what is really going on, Nicholas?

374
00:23:18,527 --> 00:23:20,567
(House Music)

375
00:23:20,688 --> 00:23:21,687
This guy

376
00:23:21,808 --> 00:23:25,049
lived here for a month
and it is the 5th Time, that ..

377
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:27,530
He thinks because he's got a roof terrace,
he can get away with anything.

378
00:23:27,651 --> 00:23:30,450
Calm down, he is nice. Yesterday,
he carried up my shopping bags.

379
00:23:30,571 --> 00:23:33,051
Because he wanted to hit on you...

380
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:35,652
One have to know one's limits.

381
00:23:37,134 --> 00:23:39,933
(Ncont. Music, voices, bells)

382
00:23:40,094 --> 00:23:41,214
(Knocks)

383
00:23:41,335 --> 00:23:42,814
(Music and voices are getting louder)

384
00:23:42,935 --> 00:23:45,095
Hi. Come in.

385
00:23:45,216 --> 00:23:49,697
(Sugababes: "Get Sexy")

386
00:24:03,582 --> 00:24:06,062
Pedro, old scoundrel! You look good!

387
00:24:06,183 --> 00:24:09,303
- How was Hong Kong? Mmmm!
- I think that's a mix-up.

388
00:24:09,424 --> 00:24:12,904
Today we both will rock and roll.
To old times, Pedro!

389
00:24:13,025 --> 00:24:14,145
"Old school"!

390
00:24:14,266 --> 00:24:16,985
I get us a bottle.
Do not run away, Pedro, huh?

391
00:24:17,106 --> 00:24:20,386
(To "Get Sexy" in the background)

392
00:24:24,429 --> 00:24:26,428
Hey, neighbor! Glad you're here!

393
00:24:26,549 --> 00:24:29,950
- Mr. Ades, sorry that I...
- Hey, I'm Jerome. That's Dany.

394
00:24:30,071 --> 00:24:32,350
- This is my neighbor.
- Chic robe.

395
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:35,111
Ok, Jerome would it be perhaps possible

396
00:24:35,232 --> 00:24:37,592
- ..to make the music a bit quieter?
- Oh, chill, amigo.

397
00:24:37,713 --> 00:24:39,712
Have a drink, celebrate with us.
It's a cool party.

398
00:24:39,834 --> 00:24:41,793
Ok, watch out, amigo.
My girlfriend and I,

399
00:24:41,914 --> 00:24:43,034
We need to work early
tomorrow morning, ok?

400
00:24:43,155 --> 00:24:44,755
Do you think
that is the Playboy Mansion?

401
00:24:44,876 --> 00:24:46,355
This is my housewarming party.

402
00:24:46,476 --> 00:24:49,796
If you do not like to join,
don't play your frustration on us.

403
00:24:49,917 --> 00:24:53,517
Frustration? What kind of frus..
This is really. ..

404
00:24:53,998 --> 00:24:55,118
Pedro!

405
00:24:55,959 --> 00:24:57,079
Hm?

406
00:24:57,199 --> 00:25:00,039
(You can hear the music
now just as a dull roar)

407
00:25:01,281 --> 00:25:03,281
I'll call tomorrow to the property manager.

408
00:25:03,402 --> 00:25:05,601

(Still squeaking)

414
00:25:49,897 --> 00:25:53,697
Hello, Mrs. Feldberg. Well? How are you?

415
00:25:53,818 --> 00:25:56,257
Thank you. Extremely exciting today.

416
00:25:57,419 --> 00:25:59,418
Oh!

417
00:25:59,579 --> 00:26:02,260
(again squeaking)

418
00:26:02,381 --> 00:26:04,700
I wanted to ask you,
whether you. ..

419
00:26:07,542 --> 00:26:12,663
Um. . . Yet. . . Still have the
Biotrockenfutter. For the little ones.

420
00:26:12,784 --> 00:26:15,664
Nah. Has no one bought except you.

421
00:26:16,145 --> 00:26:17,384
Ok...

422
00:26:17,746 --> 00:26:18,985
I've got a guinea pig.

423
00:26:19,106 --> 00:26:20,906
Hm hm.

424
00:26:21,307 --> 00:26:22,306
I also had one once.

425
00:26:23,548 --> 00:26:24,547
When I was 7.

426
00:26:27,189 --> 00:26:30,069
Mm! "I've got a guinea pig!"

427
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:32,710
God! How stupid must one be!

428
00:26:34,871 --> 00:26:35,871
Well?

429
00:26:36,912 --> 00:26:40,392

Yes!

Old father,
what do you want here, guys?

438
00:27:11,483 --> 00:27:12,962
Do you know a Jenny from Weding (disctrict name)?

Works at the airport.
Sells credit cards.

440

Excuse me.

441
00:27:18,286 --> 00:27:21,045
- Jenny? Never heard of her.
- Jenny says,

442
00:27:21,167 --> 00:27:25,087
You were slightly charmless recently
You have not called and so on.

443
00:27:25,207 --> 00:27:26,647
I do not know what you try to say

444
00:27:26,768 --> 00:27:28,288
but you've chosen the wrong person.

445
00:27:28,409 --> 00:27:30,408
Jenny is family, comprende?

446
00:27:30,529 --> 00:27:34,330
Hey! I know you. You're
This sweet cute guy

447

00:27:37,011 --> 00:27:39,251
Guy do not fuck with us.
You stand a meter away from the cliff.

Do not play the gangster here

for the whole world. "Planet Earth".

478
00:29:37,771 --> 00:29:39,330
Just as "We Are The World".

479
00:29:39,452 --> 00:29:42,571
We get a children's choir!
I. . . I got goose bumps, you!

480
00:29:42,692 --> 00:29:43,932
Me too, hey.

481
00:29:44,853 --> 00:29:47,453
(clears throat) Bruce. ..
I think Jerome is right.

482
00:29:47,573 --> 00:29:51,174
The rhyme "climate prima"
that's silly, isn't it?

483
00:29:51,895 --> 00:29:54,055
What should be silly with
global warming?

484
00:29:54,176 --> 00:29:55,616
No-nothing.

485
00:29:55,737 --> 00:29:58,336
How about if you just
skip global warming?

486
00:29:59,377 --> 00:30:01,898
Skip?
Conceal the truth?

487
00:30:02,018 --> 00:30:05,579
Hello, Loco! All of humanity
is struggling to survive.

488
00:30:05,699 --> 00:30:07,700
Bruce! Who do you think,
who you are?

489
00:30:07,821 --> 00:30:09,140
Fucking Bob Dylan, or what?

490
00:30:09,261 --> 00:30:12,101
We make entertainment here!
That 's an easy job, ok?

491
00:30:12,222 --> 00:30:14,542
So Give me a break
with the survival of mankind!

492
00:30:14,663 --> 00:30:15,902
I can not hear the shit anymore!

493
00:30:16,023 --> 00:30:17,502
(Gasps in horror)

494
00:30:17,623 --> 00:30:19,183
For you this may be business, Jerome,

495
00:30:19,304 --> 00:30:21,464
For me it's a matter of the heart.

496
00:30:21,584 --> 00:30:23,264
I'll take global warming very seriously.

497
00:30:23,385 --> 00:30:24,864
I ride bike!

498
00:30:24,986 --> 00:30:28,466
Yes, because they took your driver's
license, you drunk skunk!

499
00:30:28,587 --> 00:30:29,586
I must not listen to that any longer.

500
00:30:29,707 --> 00:30:32,187
You are not ultimately the only
Producer who wants to work with me.

501
00:30:35,469 --> 00:30:38,030
- Fuck!
- (Bruce) Where is the door?

502
00:30:38,151 --> 00:30:42,150
(Loud Music)

503
00:30:43,032 --> 00:30:45,031
I do not believe it
another scratch!

504
00:30:45,153 --> 00:30:46,872
This motherfucker!

505
00:30:46,993 --> 00:30:49,273
Maybe you should re-register
your car in Berlin.

506
00:30:49,394 --> 00:30:50,393
I'm from Munich, my friend.

507
00:30:51,595 --> 00:30:53,795
Well, maybe it is
not only your license plate.

508
00:30:53,916 --> 00:30:56,235
Maybe you should remove
this one, you know?

509
00:30:56,356 --> 00:30:57,596
Remove?

510
00:30:57,717 --> 00:31:00,077
Before I remove this one, I'd
rather cut off my dick!

511
00:31:00,197 --> 00:31:04,517
(More lively music, moans)

512
00:31:06,439 --> 00:31:08,239
- Hey, Jerome.
- And?

513
00:31:22,045 --> 00:31:25,045
- And when is the deadline?
- The day after tomorrow.

514
00:31:27,687 --> 00:31:29,686
I can handle it pretty bad, Nik.

515
00:31:30,607 --> 00:31:33,087
But in the end it is
Nina's decision and...

516
00:31:33,208 --> 00:31:35,688
It is simply the most sensible
way, you know?

517
00:31:38,210 --> 00:31:39,209
Hey!

518
00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:40,769
Hey?

519
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:42,891
(Laughs) Do you know me no more?

520
00:31:43,011 --> 00:31:44,411
Um. ..

521
00:31:44,532 --> 00:31:46,771
The beer advertising last year. ..

522
00:31:46,893 --> 00:31:49,292
The 3rd Bikini girls left behind.
(Laughs)

523
00:31:49,413 --> 00:31:51,213
Yeah, uh, right.

524
00:31:53,175 --> 00:31:54,173
Niklas.

525
00:31:54,295 --> 00:31:55,375
I know.

526
00:31:58,096 --> 00:32:00,096
- Mary.
- Ah.

527
00:32:05,539 --> 00:32:08,259
- How's the modeling?
- Super.

528
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:11,300
That is why I work here
in the gym.

529
00:32:11,421 --> 00:32:12,900
(Laughter)

530
00:32:13,981 --> 00:32:17,221
If we again have a campaign
we have you in our files.

531
00:32:17,343 --> 00:32:20,343
You can find also
my cell phone number in it.

532
00:32:21,264 --> 00:32:26,545
(Swinging Music)

533
00:32:46,952 --> 00:32:48,192
What are you doing?

534
00:32:48,313 --> 00:32:49,912
Hm I'm working.

535
00:32:50,033 --> 00:32:51,753
Are you an arrow? (Chuckles)

536
00:32:51,874 --> 00:32:54,153
- Looks like it, doesn't it?
- (Giggle)

537
00:32:54,274 --> 00:32:56,114
Yes. . . Children. (Laughs)

538
00:32:56,235 --> 00:32:58,114
(Jasmine still giggles)
I want a pizza.

539
00:32:58,236 --> 00:33:00,995
- With salami and tomato sauce.
- Tuna!

540
00:33:01,117 --> 00:33:03,756
Ok, then. . . Just follow the arrow.

541
00:33:03,877 --> 00:33:05,437
- Bye!
- Bye!

542
00:33:05,558 --> 00:33:07,518
- Bye.
- Tye, little arrow!

543
00:33:07,639 --> 00:33:09,759
This arrow was funny!

544
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:12,799
(Tommi) I would like tuna pizza
without vegetables.

545
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:15,840
(Susanne) tuna pizza without vegetables?
There's never vegetables on it, Tommy.

546
00:33:15,961 --> 00:33:22,122
Nina! When you hear that here, then, um,
just call me back, because...

547
00:33:22,244 --> 00:33:25,244
I wanted to ask you. . . With
the clinic, that was today, right?

548
00:33:25,365 --> 00:33:28,685
And because I wanted to again...
..talk to you about it, yes?

549
00:33:28,806 --> 00:33:32,326
Nina, it's me again. I now
already called a few times and uh. ..

550
00:33:32,447 --> 00:33:34,687
Nina, now answer, man!

551
00:33:34,808 --> 00:33:37,808
Nina, I do. . . I am coming now, ok?
I come now.

552
00:33:37,928 --> 00:33:39,168
Shit!

553
00:33:39,369 --> 00:33:42,169
The address of the clinic Schultheiss,
fast!

554
00:33:42,290 --> 00:33:46,850
(Exciting Music)

555
00:33:46,971 --> 00:33:48,451
(Squeaky brake)

556
00:33:49,612 --> 00:33:53,692
(More exciting music)

557
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:15,780
Stop! I'm the father!

558
00:34:16,621 --> 00:34:17,861
Of the appendix?

559
00:34:19,302 --> 00:34:20,421
Carry on.

560
00:34:26,104 --> 00:34:27,104
What was the name again?

561
00:34:27,225 --> 00:34:28,704
Nina Hellmich!

562
00:34:34,987 --> 00:34:37,507
Yes. She had an appointment.

563
00:34:37,628 --> 00:34:38,748
(Chewing noisily)

564
00:34:38,868 --> 00:34:40,348
This morning at 8:00.

565
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:45,590
Has not come.

566
00:34:45,711 --> 00:34:50,071
(Laughs and claps his hands)

567
00:34:50,192 --> 00:34:51,672
Whoo!

568
00:34:51,793 --> 00:34:54,273
Yes. . . Thank you.

569
00:34:56,554 --> 00:35:00,035
It's not that - Jerome -
I do not have the courage

570
00:35:00,155 --> 00:35:03,355
to talk to her. It's about that
I still do not know what to do. ..

571
00:35:03,477 --> 00:35:07,196
Guenther. . . Just be yourself Hm?

572
00:35:07,318 --> 00:35:09,397
Yes, but the problem is,
whenever I am myself,

573
00:35:09,519 --> 00:35:11,758
then it doesn't work with the women.

574
00:35:11,879 --> 00:35:13,679
OK...

575
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:18,880
Do you know "Magnum"? The series
from the 80s with Tom Selleck?

576
00:35:20,241 --> 00:35:22,721
- Yes, this detective in Hawaii? Hm hm.
- Hm hm.

577
00:35:24,884 --> 00:35:25,882
Be Magnum.

578
00:35:26,003 --> 00:35:31,004
("Magnum P. I." theme song)

579
00:35:37,967 --> 00:35:40,687
(Still "Magnum P. I." melody
in the background)

580
00:35:40,808 --> 00:35:41,848
Hello, Miss Feldberg.

581
00:35:42,369 --> 00:35:43,848
How are you?

582
00:35:44,490 --> 00:35:45,809
Well, thank you.

583
00:35:47,410 --> 00:35:48,730
Interesting shirt.

584
00:35:49,611 --> 00:35:50,611
Ah. ..

585
00:35:50,732 --> 00:35:54,612
I ordered the organic feed for you.
Especially for you.

586
00:35:54,733 --> 00:35:56,853
It's over there at the canaries.

587
00:35:56,974 --> 00:35:58,453
Very nice, thank you.

588
00:35:59,894 --> 00:36:03,255
I. . . Have one question
Mrs. . . Feldberg. I, uh. ..

589
00:36:03,376 --> 00:36:04,376
I wanted to suggest

590
00:36:04,496 --> 00:36:06,576
that we might...
...do something together

591
00:36:06,697 --> 00:36:09,857
purely amicable.
Something nice, go to the zoo. ..

592
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:11,938
I work in the zoo.

593
00:36:12,059 --> 00:36:14,178
(Laughs) Ah, yes.

594
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:17,179
Yes, or to. . To the movies? Hm.

595
00:36:18,781 --> 00:36:22,141
No, no, das.. . Actually, that's
a very nice idea.

596
00:36:22,262 --> 00:36:24,782
So if you do not mind
I would like to

597
00:36:24,903 --> 00:36:26,863
bring along my son
and take his little girlfriend.

598
00:36:26,984 --> 00:36:29,423
No! I love kids!

599
00:36:29,544 --> 00:36:31,224
My name is Gunther.

600
00:36:31,345 --> 00:36:33,025
Does not matter.

601
00:36:33,146 --> 00:36:34,265
(Laughs)

602
00:36:34,386 --> 00:36:39,107
(happy waltz music)

603
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:49,589
(Insane screams)

604
00:37:01,315 --> 00:37:02,555
You have to call "Mau" said Dad.

605
00:37:03,395 --> 00:37:04,514
W-what?

606
00:37:04,635 --> 00:37:06,595
"Mau". You have to call "Mau".

607
00:37:07,717 --> 00:37:10,276
Excuse me, please. ..

608
00:37:10,397 --> 00:37:13,037
It's me, Dad. Roland.

609
00:37:13,838 --> 00:37:14,958
Your Roland.

610
00:37:15,079 --> 00:37:17,879
(Melancholic music begins)

611
00:37:23,962 --> 00:37:26,802
Would be nice if you would
bake your cookies.

612
00:37:26,923 --> 00:37:29,202
For me and for Tommi.

613
00:37:29,323 --> 00:37:31,403
They don't let me anymore.

614
00:37:33,165 --> 00:37:34,164
Who?

615
00:37:34,685 --> 00:37:36,685
I pay a shit on
the damn manager!

616
00:37:36,806 --> 00:37:38,846
If anyone here again hinders
my father from baking.

617
00:37:38,967 --> 00:37:41,847
- Then it pops! Is that clear?
- Now you listen to me!

618
00:37:42,408 --> 00:37:44,488
Your father almost burned down
the whole home last X-mas!

619
00:37:45,929 --> 00:37:47,729
My father has baked all his life.

620
00:37:49,490 --> 00:37:51,570
What else has he left?

621
00:38:03,455 --> 00:38:06,935
What the hell are you doing, Jerome?
Bruce is pretty pissed off!

622
00:38:07,416 --> 00:38:10,696
What is wrong with you?
When will this fucking anthem be finished?

623
00:38:10,817 --> 00:38:13,738
It is not so easy
to work with colleague Bruce.

624
00:38:13,858 --> 00:38:15,978
Bruce is a complete idiot, so what?
You won't have to marry him!

625
00:38:16,099 --> 00:38:18,058
We're talking about the
deal of your life.

626
00:38:18,179 --> 00:38:20,939
Do you want to mess up? You have
to fight, fight, fight!

627
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:22,300
I spoke 3 times on his answering machine!

628
00:38:22,421 --> 00:38:24,581
What should I do
if he does not call back?

629
00:38:24,702 --> 00:38:26,021
Write him a letter.

630
00:38:26,142 --> 00:38:27,381
A letter?

631
00:38:27,502 --> 00:38:29,742
Yes. By hand, with a fountain pen.

632
00:38:29,863 --> 00:38:31,343
- (Laughs)
- "Old school".

633
00:38:31,464 --> 00:38:32,784
Silk paper. He likes that.

634
00:38:32,904 --> 00:38:34,144
Powder his ass.

635
00:38:37,586 --> 00:38:39,185
You must now turn off your pride.

636
00:38:39,306 --> 00:38:42,306
You are on the finish line. Stay cool.

637
00:38:56,953 --> 00:38:58,952
(Troubled voiced out thoughts of Jerome)
'Dear Bruce,

638
00:38:59,753 --> 00:39:03,073
'I can not tell you
how sorry I am for what happened.

639
00:39:03,194 --> 00:39:05,434
'I was not myself.

640
00:39:06,716 --> 00:39:10,435
'Your text to "all children of this earth"
is so profound,

641
00:39:10,557 --> 00:39:12,556

for a few days,

understand its beauty.

'And against hunger, war,
Global warming and AIDS. '.

647
00:39:27,242 --> 00:39:30,242
You're a great artist, Bruce,
and I would like nothing more

648
00:39:30,803 --> 00:39:32,803
than to be friends again.

649
00:39:32,924 --> 00:39:34,924
Forgive me.

650
00:39:35,045 --> 00:39:36,684
Love, thy Jerome.

651
00:39:38,486 --> 00:39:40,485
Oh, man, Jerome. ..

652
00:39:41,127 --> 00:39:43,607
Sabrina
this has never happened to me originally.

653
00:39:43,728 --> 00:39:47,448
This is most likely because I do. ..
Have too much in my head or something.

654
00:39:47,929 --> 00:39:51,409
That's not so bad.
This can happen to anyone.

655
00:39:51,851 --> 00:39:54,090
(The doorbell rings)

656
00:39:54,211 --> 00:39:56,051
Who is that?

657
00:39:57,211 --> 00:39:59,652
Everyone deserves a 2nd Opportunity.

658
00:39:59,773 --> 00:40:01,092
And so we make up
for lost time,

659
00:40:01,213 --> 00:40:03,173
I've thought to myself,
I move in for a while with you.

660
00:40:03,294 --> 00:40:04,653
Excuse me, what, please?

661
00:40:04,774 --> 00:40:07,574
Now we just make music.
Day and night! Nonstop!

662
00:40:07,695 --> 00:40:08,815
Well, what do you say?

663
00:40:08,936 --> 00:40:10,215
Super.

664
00:40:11,096 --> 00:40:12,816
Do you have something to drink there?

665
00:40:14,777 --> 00:40:18,378
'All the children of this earth,

666

00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:22,299
(gasps)

668
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:23,900
Here you should go to minor.

669
00:40:24,901 --> 00:40:26,380
How does that work? It's D-major.

670
00:40:26,501 --> 00:40:29,341
- Built in a bridge.
- Built in a bridge!

671
00:40:29,462 --> 00:40:31,622
Bruce, it's late.
If you do not like the play-back,

672
00:40:31,743 --> 00:40:33,143
I like to sit down tomorrow morning
and make a new one.

673
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:35,663
I want to be part of the process
Do you understand?

674
00:40:35,784 --> 00:40:37,945
Part of the creation! I. ..

675
00:40:38,065 --> 00:40:41,665
I am not only the artist, Jeronimo.
I am a writer!

676
00:40:41,787 --> 00:40:44,306
I hear sounds, ideas I have!

677
00:40:44,427 --> 00:40:45,827
Then you might want to
learn to play piano!

678
00:40:45,947 --> 00:40:47,828
Jimmi Hendrix
could not play the piano.

679
00:40:47,949 --> 00:40:48,947
Ha!

680
00:40:49,068 --> 00:40:50,949
We must free ourselves,
let the vibe grow.

681
00:40:51,069 --> 00:40:54,869
Come on! Let's jam!
Just chip in a beat!

682
00:40:54,990 --> 00:40:56,510
What kind of Beat?

683
00:40:56,631 --> 00:41:01,992
Well, just some beat. Wait!
Ts-ts-ts-ts-ts-ts-ts-ts!

684
00:41:02,113 --> 00:41:06,153
(Strong rhythmic beat)

685
00:41:09,795 --> 00:41:14,436
My name is Bruce Berger and I enter
the game and I'm bad! I'm bad!

686
00:41:16,237 --> 00:41:20,638
- 'Never take a trade! I'm bad! I'm bad!
- (Sabrina) 'Yeah! What is love?

687
00:41:20,759 --> 00:41:23,959
- 'Baby, do not hurt me! Ah-ah! Yes!
- 'I'm bad!

688
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:26,119
- 'I'm bad!'
- 'Yeah, yeah!'

689
00:41:26,241 --> 00:41:30,121
(Unintelligible)

690
00:41:30,242 --> 00:41:34,122
(More terrible singing)

691
00:41:34,243 --> 00:41:36,203
(Voice fades)
'I'm bad, bad, bad, bad, bad. . '..

692
00:41:36,324 --> 00:41:37,564
Mrs. Koschinsky,
I got the contract.

693
00:41:37,684 --> 00:41:39,164
I want only to talk to my lawyer. ..

694
00:41:39,285 --> 00:41:41,045
Mrs. Koschinsky,
I have a meeting now.

695
00:41:41,166 --> 00:41:43,045
I call you back. Yes. Thank you!

696
00:41:43,166 --> 00:41:45,286
We need the Sportscom Layouts
until tomorrow morning at 8:00.

697
00:41:45,407 --> 00:41:47,406
- My turn, Wolfgang.
- The minister has called

698
00:41:47,527 --> 00:41:48,647
and confirmed the appointment
to visit the church.

699
00:41:48,768 --> 00:41:50,007
Thank you.

700
00:41:56,610 --> 00:41:58,090
(Sighs.

701
00:42:05,013 --> 00:42:06,253
(Whisper) Niklas!

702
00:42:06,614 --> 00:42:08,494
He can better burry yourself
right now.

703
00:42:08,615 --> 00:42:11,574
Nik! Let yourself not be confused
by this superficial hedonists.

704
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:13,775
You do everything right.

705
00:42:13,896 --> 00:42:16,776
Is there anything better in life
than building a nest?

706
00:42:16,897 --> 00:42:18,697
What are you? A blackbird?

707
00:42:20,178 --> 00:42:24,059
Niklas. You have done everything right
your damn life long.

708
00:42:24,179 --> 00:42:27,859
Do not you think it is time,
time to do something wrong?

709
00:42:28,141 --> 00:42:30,141
Really wrong?

710
00:42:31,222 --> 00:42:34,342
(Loud music begins)

711
00:42:35,863 --> 00:42:39,184
And so are you studying Media Studies
and work here

712
00:42:39,305 --> 00:42:42,944
and in the gym,
and. . . Take acting lessons. ..

713
00:42:43,066 --> 00:42:44,585
I think I do not know...
not exactly what I want.

714
00:42:44,707 --> 00:42:47,266
Hm I know exactly what you mean.

715
00:42:48,508 --> 00:42:52,428
I have an audition next week
for another soap about stewardesses.

716
00:42:52,548 --> 00:42:54,029
It sounds really cool.

717
00:42:54,909 --> 00:42:57,109
Do you want to help me?

718
00:42:57,230 --> 00:42:58,950
Thus, when learning text, or something?

719
00:43:04,273 --> 00:43:07,392
Max and Steffi have promised.
And Paul and Marion also.

720
00:43:09,034 --> 00:43:11,034
Caro and Holger
are no longer together.

721
00:43:12,035 --> 00:43:13,595
They divorce now.

722
00:43:13,716 --> 00:43:15,195
- Oops!
- Hm hm.

723
00:43:15,316 --> 00:43:17,556
- These were married just what?
- 2 years.

724
00:43:17,677 --> 00:43:18,916
Ts!

725
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:23,078
The idiot did cheat on her all
the time with a 20-year-old intern.

726
00:43:24,639 --> 00:43:25,878
How embarrassing!

727
00:43:33,482 --> 00:43:36,722
The RX-21 0-Turbo
in the sports version.

728
00:43:37,764 --> 00:43:43,645
Including iPod cradle, sun roof
with ventilation windows and leather seats.

729
00:43:43,765 --> 00:43:45,925
Thanks to the swiveling wheels
adjustable with gas spring.

730
00:43:46,046 --> 00:43:50,206
Also ideal for high speed
and in rough terrain.

731
00:43:50,727 --> 00:43:53,288
I did not really want to
participate in a rally.

732
00:43:53,409 --> 00:43:55,288
As well. . . You can not
afford it!

733
00:43:55,409 --> 00:43:58,529
And then of course the F-youth.
They start from 4 years.

734
00:43:58,651 --> 00:44:00,650
- What youth?
- Football, Nina.

735
00:44:00,771 --> 00:44:03,251
The very young.
You find buddies for life there.

736
00:44:03,372 --> 00:44:04,851
This is how Nik and myself met.

737
00:44:04,972 --> 00:44:06,452
Philip. ..

738
00:44:08,013 --> 00:44:09,333
For you it's all
just a game, huh?

739
00:44:09,454 --> 00:44:11,293
No, why?

740
00:44:13,215 --> 00:44:16,215
I've got to go now. I have a date
with Lars for coffee.

741
00:44:16,336 --> 00:44:18,496
How, Lars? THE Lars?

742
00:44:18,617 --> 00:44:20,417
I thought he is in Australia
to find himself?

743
00:44:20,537 --> 00:44:22,537
Apparently he has found himself.

744
00:44:24,699 --> 00:44:28,700
- I'll call you later.
- Hey, I do not find this ok from you!

745
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:32,340
Philip! You always wanted that we
leave some room for ourselves...

746
00:44:32,461 --> 00:44:33,701
Hello? Earth to Nina!

747
00:44:33,822 --> 00:44:35,822
You're pregnant, pregnant from me.

748
00:44:35,943 --> 00:44:37,062
So what?

749
00:44:37,183 --> 00:44:38,502
Do you want to burn a horseshoe
on me or what?

750
00:44:38,623 --> 00:44:39,863
I'm your brood cow?

751
00:44:39,983 --> 00:44:42,463
I really do not need an
Australia loser ex-boyfriend,

752
00:44:42,584 --> 00:44:44,065
who wants to slime his way
back into your life!

753
00:44:44,185 --> 00:44:46,665
Hey, Philip, relax!
Lars and I are friends, not more!

754
00:44:46,786 --> 00:44:47,785
In addition, he is no loser.

755
00:44:47,907 --> 00:44:49,706
After all in Australia
he established his diving school.

756
00:44:49,827 --> 00:44:51,307
And who needs
A fucking dive school?

757
00:44:51,428 --> 00:44:54,547
Nina, I'm almost done
with the business plan.

758
00:44:54,668 --> 00:44:56,669
I built something for us. An empire!

759
00:44:58,229 --> 00:44:59,709
I did not know that you model...

760
00:45:04,791 --> 00:45:07,151
I find that very nasty! You said
that's a campaign for Berlin.

761
00:45:07,272 --> 00:45:09,553
- And now I'm Mr. suicide!
- I'm sorry. ..

762
00:45:09,674 --> 00:45:11,033
'The whole town
is full of posters! '

(Jasmine)You look
like my uncle Gerhard.

765
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:34,480
- (All laugh)
- He looks like Gunther.

766
00:45:39,483 --> 00:45:42,683
The bald ibis is native to
Central Europe since the Stone Age

767
00:45:42,804 --> 00:45:45,604
and lives in a strictly monogamous
Couple relationship, the ibis,

768
00:45:45,725 --> 00:45:48,325
Thus, is a life long. . . Faithfull.

("Magnum P. I." theme song fades)

772
00:46:01,370 --> 00:46:04,330
(Susan) Well, then 2 years ago
was this accident with the girl.

773
00:46:04,452 --> 00:46:06,411
Some madman pushed her
in front of his train.

774
00:46:07,492 --> 00:46:09,811
Then he could no longer work
and has just been sitting at home

775
00:46:09,933 --> 00:46:12,413
and cried and cried and. ..

776
00:46:15,054 --> 00:46:17,055
Beat around him.

777
00:46:20,897 --> 00:46:24,256
Yes, maybe. ..
Do we want to go to the penguins?

778
00:46:29,619 --> 00:46:33,419
- Oh!
- Ah. . . Tommi! Come on!

(More pop)

784
00:46:57,148 --> 00:46:58,468
Oops!

785
00:47:00,469 --> 00:47:03,069
Yesterday, she was a half hour
on the phone with me.

786

- Hm! That's a good sign, ey.
- Hm.

787
00:47:05,431 --> 00:47:07,430
And on the weekend
we go together into the Park

- watch People. ..

Good, which is after all.
What I told you.

And you? How is it?
Do you have a relationsh...Ah. ..

791

Did you also. ..
A relationship with. . . There with a. . . Woman?

792
00:47:21,277 --> 00:47:24,756
With a woman? Mmm. ..

793
00:47:24,877 --> 00:47:26,757
- Time here and there.
- Ts.

794
00:47:27,798 --> 00:47:31,279
So, you're not mar. . Married,
or. ..

No.

797
00:47:35,521 --> 00:47:38,521
- In love?
- Guy, hey!

798
00:47:50,446 --> 00:47:52,565
No! That is not true!

799
00:47:53,566 --> 00:47:55,287
No! Mannhart!

800

Ricky?

801
00:47:57,848 --> 00:48:00,088
- Hey!
- I call you back, Mannhart.

802
00:48:02,130 --> 00:48:04,210
Um. . . Philip?

803
00:48:04,330 --> 00:48:05,489
Henrion!

804
00:48:06,611 --> 00:48:09,091
- Hello!
- That's a coincidence, huh?

805
00:48:09,212 --> 00:48:13,012
- How are you?
- Grandiose grandiose!

806
00:48:13,133 --> 00:48:16,373
(Ricky) How long we have not
seen? Since the B-youth, right?

807
00:48:16,494 --> 00:48:19,454
I think that's true fate,
that we meet now, Ricky.

808
00:48:19,575 --> 00:48:22,055
You invest in
Start-up companies, don't you?

809
00:48:22,176 --> 00:48:24,176
Yes, among others. Why?

810
00:48:24,296 --> 00:48:27,777
Ricky. . . The time is ripe
for a fast food chain,

the laws of the modern marketing
combined with the ideals of our time.

812
00:48:32,259 --> 00:48:35,419
- You mean a kind of "eco-McDonalds"?
- Exactly!

813
00:48:35,540 --> 00:48:38,260
A high-quality
Organic fast-food chain.

814
00:48:38,382 --> 00:48:41,382
But not one that looks like Eco.
High gloss, uniforms.

815
00:48:41,502 --> 00:48:44,382

a catchy name,

816
00:48:44,503 --> 00:48:46,622
soon known in the whole world.

- Kruger!
- The fact is,

823
00:48:57,308 --> 00:48:59,987
such plans
have all the big fast food companies

824
00:49:00,108 --> 00:49:03,428
for years in a drawer. Such a
Chain would have to ask elite prices

825
00:49:03,549 --> 00:49:06,029
what with the philosophy of a
Commercial chain for all social levels.

826
00:49:06,150 --> 00:49:08,630
- Is not compatible.
- Say,

827
00:49:08,751 --> 00:49:11,591
what is Niklas doing, by the way?
He marries in the fall, right?

828
00:49:11,712 --> 00:49:13,352
Do you still have contact?

829
00:49:14,233 --> 00:49:15,712
Yes, we do. ..

830
00:49:17,674 --> 00:49:19,994
Tell me, can let me out
there in front?

831
00:49:24,316 --> 00:49:26,956

really not ok from you.

836
00:50:23,255 --> 00:50:26,616
You never call, I do not know
where you are, I'm worried, really.

837
00:50:26,737 --> 00:50:28,456
I was still in the studio with Sabrina.

838
00:50:28,577 --> 00:50:31,937
Jerome, we both know, the woman
sounds like a wounded hyena.

839
00:50:32,058 --> 00:50:35,058

which was not up a tree at the count of 3..

Male or female, whatever.
It was the 70s.

841

But then one day you check,
that you can not only fuck around.

842
00:50:43,262 --> 00:50:46,742
What you are missing is a sense.
You have to make the jump.

The potential!

- Yes, yes, yes. Take it easy.

I do not want money from you.

863

Surely my decision. ..

951
00:57:30,514 --> 00:57:32,514
No. This is my decision.

952
00:57:32,635 --> 00:57:35,115
I'm really sorry, but. ..

953
00:57:37,036 --> 00:57:38,836
Please purchase from somewhere else now.

954
00:57:38,957 --> 00:57:40,957
Why ...

955
00:57:47,159 --> 00:57:50,159
(Melancholic, moving music)

956
00:58:17,049 --> 00:58:18,288
(Nina) Oops!

957
00:58:19,090 --> 00:58:20,809
Oh no! (Nina laughs)

958
00:58:24,812 --> 00:58:27,932
Wow, Philip, this is so great!
I just can not believe it!

959
00:58:28,974 --> 00:58:30,453
Ouch!

960
00:58:30,574 --> 00:58:32,934
(Still moving music)

961
00:58:33,055 --> 00:58:34,294
(Door opens)

962
00:58:34,415 --> 00:58:35,815
Hello, Day!

963
00:58:36,935 --> 00:58:38,015
- Hello.
- Hello.

964
00:58:38,136 --> 00:58:40,375
'Scuse me,
But we are not open until next week.

965
00:58:40,497 --> 00:58:44,577
Mr. Henrion, my name is Stobanski.
From the Factory Inspectorate.

966
00:58:45,539 --> 00:58:46,778
Ah, I think, uh. ..

967
00:58:46,899 --> 00:58:49,259
We do know us
from the gym, Mr. Stupinski?

968
00:58:49,380 --> 00:58:51,499
Ah, Stobanski is the name.

969
00:58:52,341 --> 00:58:55,821
Would you tell me
what are you doing here?

970
00:58:55,942 --> 00:58:57,941
Yes, I'll open a restaurant.

971
00:58:58,062 --> 00:58:59,982
Oh, then you obviously
do not know that

972
00:59:00,104 --> 00:59:02,423
this here runs under
the retail license regulations?

973
00:59:02,544 --> 00:59:04,543
I.e., you have no authorization,

974
00:59:04,664 --> 00:59:06,945
Hto operate a commercial catering
here. Unless...

975
00:59:07,066 --> 00:59:10,425
 you ask for a special permit.
But I see no chance to get that.

976
00:59:11,067 --> 00:59:13,306
Since you would need separate
Guest toilets, male, female,

977
00:59:13,427 --> 00:59:17,188
and a modern exhaust equipment
with activated carbon filters.

978
00:59:17,309 --> 00:59:20,789
And separate dirty water,
dish and hand sink.

979
00:59:20,910 --> 00:59:22,830
Also, here in the kitchen.

980
00:59:22,951 --> 00:59:24,791
The floor is made of wood,
which must be replaced.

981
00:59:24,911 --> 00:59:26,151
Because of the risk of slipping.

982
00:59:26,272 --> 00:59:29,272
Slippery?
That really is ridiculous!

983
00:59:29,393 --> 00:59:30,392
We are not in Djibouti.

984
00:59:30,513 --> 00:59:33,353
Now you stop it, You puppet!

985
00:59:33,474 --> 00:59:34,753
This is where someone is trying
to build something up,

986
00:59:34,874 --> 00:59:36,514
- And you just come and...
- Shh!

987
00:59:37,355 --> 00:59:38,355
What you just said?

988
00:59:38,476 --> 00:59:40,915
(clears throat)
She doesn't mean it, Mr. Stupinski.

989
00:59:42,077 --> 00:59:44,076
Stobanski is my name.

990
00:59:44,997 --> 00:59:46,797
Stobanski puppet.

991
00:59:46,918 --> 00:59:49,999
And shall I tell you,
what the puppet is doing now?

992
00:59:51,240 --> 00:59:53,600
The puppet, is revoking your
commercial license

993
00:59:53,721 --> 00:59:57,521
and closes your shop until you
have rebuilt it immaculately!

994
00:59:57,642 --> 00:59:59,801
This is what the puppet does!

995
01:00:03,164 --> 01:00:05,083
Goodbye.

996
01:00:05,204 --> 01:00:09,284
I had everything under control until
started with the puppet!

997
01:00:09,405 --> 01:00:11,166
Are you kidding!

998
01:00:11,727 --> 01:00:15,607
Under control?
What did you ever have under control?

999
01:00:15,727 --> 01:00:18,207
- You are just building something. ..
- What do you understand of that, huh?

1000
01:00:18,328 --> 01:00:20,568
You play job wise
"Journey to Jerusalem"!

1001
01:00:23,771 --> 01:00:26,450
Do me a favor and just keep your
nose out of it in the future, ok?

1002
01:00:27,411 --> 01:00:29,491
OK. I will.

1003
01:00:31,373 --> 01:00:33,373
Hey, Nina. Hey!

1004
01:00:33,734 --> 01:00:35,734
I did not mean it that we....

1005
01:00:44,937 --> 01:00:46,417
(Breathes out heavily) shit. ..

1006
01:00:46,538 --> 01:00:49,178
(Quiet oriental sounds)

1007
01:01:03,944 --> 01:01:05,102
(still oriental sounds)

1008
01:01:05,224 --> 01:01:08,024
Fff! Hah! Hah! Hah!

1009
01:01:18,868 --> 01:01:21,868
Jerome! Dinner is ready!

1010
01:01:23,430 --> 01:01:24,749
(Groans)

1011
01:01:25,030 --> 01:01:28,590
- Hm! Hm hm! Hm, is good.
- Hm.

1012
01:01:28,711 --> 01:01:31,512
- Cambodian rice pudding.
- Hm!

1013
01:01:31,632 --> 01:01:32,752
I've even learned to cook sometimes, you know?

1014
01:01:32,873 --> 01:01:36,553
When I've lived in Darmstadt.
Hotel cook.

1015
01:01:36,674 --> 01:01:38,634
Hm.

1016
01:01:41,116 --> 01:01:45,116
Can I... put to you...
...a serious question?

1017
01:01:46,877 --> 01:01:48,477
Are you all just about the money?

1018
01:01:49,078 --> 01:01:51,438
I mean, I know
what is going on.

1019
01:01:52,599 --> 01:01:54,199
All they want is to milk me.

1020
01:01:55,320 --> 01:01:57,960
There is no one,
which really is interested in me.

1021
01:01:58,081 --> 01:02:00,601
Not for Bruce Berger, but. ..

1022
01:02:00,722 --> 01:02:02,041
For Manfred.

1023
01:02:03,523 --> 01:02:04,763
Manfred Eppelheim.

1024
01:02:05,923 --> 01:02:07,163
Your name is Manfred?

1025
01:02:09,444 --> 01:02:11,164
Be honest, Jerome,

1026
01:02:14,286 --> 01:02:17,487
is it all about money, or are you
standing behind the sound we make?

1027
01:02:17,607 --> 01:02:20,128
Bruce, I like the sound,
which we make.

1028
01:02:20,249 --> 01:02:22,248
I told you so written
in the letter.

1029
01:02:22,369 --> 01:02:24,008
Do you believe that?

1030
01:02:24,850 --> 01:02:27,569
And. . . We are friends?

1031
01:02:27,690 --> 01:02:28,930
You and me?

1032
01:02:29,052 --> 01:02:31,811
Well. . . Of course we are friends.

1033
01:02:34,293 --> 01:02:35,412
To us.

1034
01:02:38,854 --> 01:02:43,095
(Gary Go, "Berlin")

1035
01:03:10,705 --> 01:03:13,585
("Berlin" ends)

1036
01:03:13,706 --> 01:03:15,946
(Roland) Yes, come, run, run, run!
Max, come on, come on!

1037
01:03:16,787 --> 01:03:19,266
Sven, you must then go back too!
You have to go back sometimes!

1038
01:03:20,708 --> 01:03:21,907
(Trainer) Run, run, run, run!

1039
01:03:22,028 --> 01:03:25,228
Tommi come on, come on! Fight!

1040
01:03:29,351 --> 01:03:31,591
What's the matter, big one? Hm?

1041
01:03:33,312 --> 01:03:36,832
The Jasmine moves to Ingo. . .,
uh, Ingo city.

1042
01:03:36,954 --> 01:03:38,072
And that is that bad?

1043
01:03:39,114 --> 01:03:41,714
Oh! Tommi, huh?

1044
01:03:41,835 --> 01:03:44,274
You will again
meet a new wife, huh?

1045
01:03:44,395 --> 01:03:45,635
But I don't want a new woman!

1046
01:03:52,358 --> 01:03:57,039
Hey, Tommy, I must ask you something.
Some serious ok?

1047
01:03:58,320 --> 01:03:59,639
Does mom have another man?

1048
01:04:02,602 --> 01:04:06,402
Not? OK. Got it.

1049
01:04:06,523 --> 01:04:09,563
Well, son, and now,
Now you go back and play, ok?

1050
01:04:09,684 --> 01:04:12,083
Fight, Tommy.
You have to fight forever, forever!

1051
01:04:13,205 --> 01:04:14,525
Ok, come on, big one, yes?

1052
01:04:14,646 --> 01:04:16,645
Come, go, go, go, go, go!

1053
01:04:18,847 --> 01:04:22,047
How far away is Igor city?

1054
01:04:22,168 --> 01:04:24,888
Can we go there with the subway?

1055
01:04:26,009 --> 01:04:27,728
No, my dear.

1056
01:04:28,610 --> 01:04:30,609
Ingolstadt is located in Bavaria, you know?

1057
01:04:30,731 --> 01:04:33,051
And Bavaria is very, very far away.

1058
01:04:36,012 --> 01:04:38,252
But Jasmine could
live with us, couldn't she.

1059
01:04:41,014 --> 01:04:42,494
With her sleeping bag.

1060
01:04:42,974 --> 01:04:45,694
But she must
stay with her mom and her dad.

1061
01:04:46,655 --> 01:04:47,895
Hm?

1062
01:04:51,137 --> 01:04:52,617
What do you think,

1063
01:04:52,738 --> 01:04:55,778
if on Sunday we all go together
to the zoo again? With jasmine.

1064
01:04:55,899 --> 01:04:57,059
Hm?

1065
01:04:57,179 --> 01:04:58,299
Hm hm.

1066
01:05:05,302 --> 01:05:06,421
(A knock)

1067
01:05:07,942 --> 01:05:10,183
Jerome, is it a bad time?

1068
01:05:10,303 --> 01:05:13,303
It may sound
a bit stupid, but...

1069
01:05:13,424 --> 01:05:14,704
Can I sleep
in your bed tonight?

1070
01:05:14,825 --> 01:05:16,625
I won't touch you or something.

1071
01:05:16,745 --> 01:05:20,025
I usually get those bad dreams
before a performance, you know?

1072
01:05:20,146 --> 01:05:22,466
Now you are not serious?

1073
01:05:22,588 --> 01:05:24,747
Yes, I am.

1074
01:05:24,868 --> 01:05:27,348
(Deep breathing)

1075
01:05:29,189 --> 01:05:31,189
Jerome, are you sleeping?

1076
01:05:31,310 --> 01:05:32,790
Nah.

1077
01:05:34,392 --> 01:05:36,871
Tell me, of all the girls
to show up here

1078
01:05:36,993 --> 01:05:38,712
- just that I know -,

1079
01:05:38,833 --> 01:05:43,793
which is the one,
I mean, the one you love?

1080
01:05:45,515 --> 01:05:46,754
None.

1081
01:05:47,475 --> 01:05:49,876
But this is sad, Jerome.
Were you ever in love?

1082
01:05:49,997 --> 01:05:52,556
Of course, I was already in love.

1083
01:05:53,718 --> 01:05:55,717
But this is 20 years ago.

1084
01:05:56,518 --> 01:05:59,158
- Melanie.
- And?

1085
01:05:59,279 --> 01:06:00,719
I guess, I've screwed up.

1086
01:06:00,840 --> 01:06:02,720
How? Screwed up?

1087
01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:04,640
I just wanted to get out to conquer the world.

1088
01:06:04,761 --> 01:06:08,002
And then this guy came by
and he snatched her away.

1089
01:06:09,282 --> 01:06:10,402
And?

1090
01:06:10,523 --> 01:06:13,363
Has made her 2 children,
then he left her,

1091
01:06:13,484 --> 01:06:14,964
divorced. ..

1092
01:06:15,645 --> 01:06:18,405
And now she sits there all alone
with their two children.

1093
01:06:18,526 --> 01:06:19,526
And?

1094
01:06:19,646 --> 01:06:21,886
- And what?
- Why do you never call her?

1095
01:06:22,006 --> 01:06:24,246
I've just said,
that was more than 20 years ago.

1096
01:06:25,208 --> 01:06:26,447
And?

1097
01:06:26,568 --> 01:06:29,048
And now we sleep.

1098
01:06:29,169 --> 01:06:32,649
(Deep breathing)

1099
01:06:35,411 --> 01:06:36,410
Jerome?

1100
01:06:36,532 --> 01:06:37,531
(irritated sound)

1101
01:06:37,652 --> 01:06:39,011
I love you.

1102
01:06:39,732 --> 01:06:40,852
What?

1103
01:06:42,333 --> 01:06:43,573
I love you.

1104
01:06:44,774 --> 01:06:48,214
(Baby Bird: "If You'll Be Mine")

1105
01:07:06,741 --> 01:07:07,861
(irritated sound)

1106
01:07:07,981 --> 01:07:11,982
(Still, "If You'll Be Mine"
in the background)

1107
01:07:24,427 --> 01:07:27,428
("If You'll Be Mine" slowly fades away)

1108
01:07:27,548 --> 01:07:30,028
We still have to do the banns,
decide the seating arrangements.

1109
01:07:30,149 --> 01:07:31,949
Print the menu card,
taste the food...

1110
01:07:32,070 --> 01:07:34,509
I'm glad when all the stress
is over and we are finally gone.

1111
01:07:38,632 --> 01:07:41,792
4 weeks to do nothing,
nothing, zero.

1112
01:07:41,913 --> 01:07:43,912
I didn't tel you yet, right?

1113
01:07:44,394 --> 01:07:45,393
Hm?

1114
01:07:45,514 --> 01:07:47,394
I've booked 8 days only.

1115
01:07:49,035 --> 01:07:50,155
8 days?

1116
01:07:50,275 --> 01:07:52,235
Yes.

1117
01:07:53,116 --> 01:07:55,677
8 days on the Fiji Islands?
Is this a joke?

1118
01:07:55,798 --> 01:07:57,517
I have 5 campaigns in September,
I can not do more.

1119
01:07:57,638 --> 01:07:59,197
It's called honeymoon weeks
not honeymoon daYS.

1120
01:07:59,318 --> 01:08:00,918
Laura, we have now
financial obligations,

1121
01:08:01,039 --> 01:08:02,838
We have a house,
which we want to buy. ..

1122
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:05,239
Why don't we drive for a
weekend to the Scharmützelsee than?

1123
01:08:05,360 --> 01:08:06,440
- Hm?
- Oh, come on, mouse.

1124
01:08:12,363 --> 01:08:13,602
Shit. ..

1125
01:08:18,805 --> 01:08:21,004
(Clicks his tongue,
whistles and snaps)

1126
01:08:21,125 --> 01:08:23,685
Hey, Philip! What are you doing?
My pizza is over there

1127
01:08:23,807 --> 01:08:26,246
and you show on the kebab!
How shall this work?

1128
01:08:26,367 --> 01:08:28,967
Are you too stupid to be an arrow?

1129
01:08:29,088 --> 01:08:32,648
- I'm sorry.
- "Sorry"! You're fired!

1130
01:08:32,769 --> 01:08:36,530
- E basta! Finita!
- Vincenzo, you can not do that!

1131
01:08:36,651 --> 01:08:37,970
And how!

1132
01:08:38,091 --> 01:08:39,571
Then you stand here yourself!

1133
01:08:40,212 --> 01:08:43,212
Rudi, please! I told you,
that it is difficult at the moment.

1134
01:08:44,333 --> 01:08:46,052
Yes, of course the rent will be due! I...

1135
01:08:46,733 --> 01:08:50,374
Rudi. . . If you insist,
than inform your lawyer!

1136
01:08:50,495 --> 01:08:52,615
(Squeaky brake)

1137
01:08:54,176 --> 01:08:55,776
(Lars) And how many children
are in such a group?

1138
01:08:55,897 --> 01:08:57,137
(Loud clang)

1139
01:08:57,257 --> 01:08:58,617
1 2-1 5, or so.

1140
01:08:58,738 --> 01:09:00,137
Yes, look at that!

1141
01:09:00,258 --> 01:09:01,697
This is the famous Lars!

1142
01:09:01,819 --> 01:09:04,578
The great man with a diving school!
Wow! Lars is paying a round of Prosecco!

1143
01:09:04,700 --> 01:09:06,179
There's something to celebrate here, or what?

1144
01:09:06,300 --> 01:09:07,859
Say, I know you from somewhere else.

1145
01:09:07,981 --> 01:09:10,021
Very funny. I am the suicide
of Berlin, I know.

1146
01:09:10,142 --> 01:09:11,701
Nah, I saw you recently
at the Alex (place in Berlin).

1147
01:09:12,702 --> 01:09:14,061
With such 'an arrow costume. Can it be?

1148
01:09:15,463 --> 01:09:17,663
Now look here, Captain Nemo.
I would like to clarify one thing.

1149
01:09:17,784 --> 01:09:19,224
Nina gets my child!

1150
01:09:19,345 --> 01:09:21,504
And my son does not learn to dive

1151
01:09:21,625 --> 01:09:24,586
or such a shit
and my daughter also not! Understand?

1152
01:09:25,306 --> 01:09:26,306
And with this joker...

1153
01:09:26,427 --> 01:09:28,986
- ...you want to start a family?
- We can also go out the door.

1154
01:09:29,108 --> 01:09:30,187
- And make it like men!
- (Nina) Enough!

1155
01:09:30,308 --> 01:09:32,307
(Shrill trill)

1156
01:09:33,029 --> 01:09:34,748
That can not be true!

1157
01:09:35,989 --> 01:09:39,430
Man! He has provoked me!
From the beginning he has provoked me!

1158
01:09:39,551 --> 01:09:42,030
Ok, I think, the two of us
should go out the door.

1159
01:09:43,192 --> 01:09:44,432
Guy, are you inasane?

1160
01:09:45,473 --> 01:09:46,632
Philip, I've already said,

1161
01:09:46,753 --> 01:09:48,953
that Lars and I are just friends.
Can you finally relax?

1162
01:09:49,074 --> 01:09:51,594
Relax? Yes, of course,
I can relax super, Nina.

1163
01:09:52,475 --> 01:09:54,955
My shop is already finished, before it
once had opened!

1164
01:09:55,076 --> 01:09:58,276
I am in debt with over 12,000 €
and do not know

1165
01:09:58,397 --> 01:10:00,717
how to pay off the installments.
Not to mention all of the rent.

1166
01:10:00,838 --> 01:10:03,557
And to top it I have to watch,
how the mother of my child

1167
01:10:03,679 --> 01:10:07,920
drinks prosecco with her damned
"Jacques Cousteau for the poor " diving nut!

1168
01:10:08,040 --> 01:10:09,440
Hey, Prosecco!

1169
01:10:09,561 --> 01:10:11,680
This is super-relaxed,
this situation, right?

1170
01:10:11,801 --> 01:10:13,121
Why are you so jealous?

1171
01:10:13,242 --> 01:10:14,721
You are not interested in
me at all.

1172
01:10:14,842 --> 01:10:16,962
What a nonsense!
What makes you think that?

1173
01:10:17,083 --> 01:10:18,643
When is my birthday?

1174
01:10:21,164 --> 01:10:22,644
So, this is mean now, hey.

1175
01:10:23,605 --> 01:10:26,846
You are Capricorn, so far it's December?

1176
01:10:26,967 --> 01:10:28,246
I'm Taurus.

1177
01:10:28,847 --> 01:10:31,006
I know that.
Something with horns.

1178
01:10:31,888 --> 01:10:33,607
Today, Philip. I have birthday today.

1179
01:10:36,529 --> 01:10:38,930
I am... I, uh. ..

1180
01:10:39,891 --> 01:10:41,010
I'm sorry.

1181
01:10:42,492 --> 01:10:44,931
And then also the 25th.
That is a very special one.

1182
01:10:45,052 --> 01:10:46,612
24, Philip, I'm 24

1183
01:10:47,093 --> 01:10:49,053
Lars will fly back tomorrow to
Australia. He wanted to congratulate me

1184
01:10:49,174 --> 01:10:51,254
and say goodbye.

1185
01:10:51,734 --> 01:10:53,974
So, if you'll excuse,
I now drink my champagne.

1186
01:10:54,735 --> 01:10:56,215
Alcohol-free by the way.

1187
01:11:20,383 --> 01:11:22,384
Did they not call you?

1188
01:11:23,065 --> 01:11:24,424
Called? No, why?

1189
01:11:26,626 --> 01:11:28,426
Your father died yesterday.

1190
01:11:32,467 --> 01:11:33,587
What?

1191
01:11:36,069 --> 01:11:39,269
(Quiet sad music)

1192
01:12:01,317 --> 01:12:03,517
Hey, Master, how long
do you want to just sit here?

1193
01:12:03,638 --> 01:12:05,478
Can you stand up again?
I would like to use the machine.

1194
01:12:07,039 --> 01:12:08,038
Hello!

1195
01:12:10,240 --> 01:12:11,960
Knock knock, anybody home?

1196
01:12:13,841 --> 01:12:15,280
(Cracking)

1197
01:12:15,401 --> 01:12:19,322
What's going on here?
Are you crazy or what, Roland?

1198
01:12:19,443 --> 01:12:21,523
That's it! Once and for all! Harry!

1199
01:12:21,644 --> 01:12:24,603
Suleiman, Svetko!
Throw him out of here!

1200
01:12:24,724 --> 01:12:29,285
(Melancholic Music)

1201
01:12:43,731 --> 01:12:46,851
(Man) Mr. Feldberg, you have driven
through 23 Stations without stopping.

1202
01:12:46,972 --> 01:12:49,132
You have endangered hundreds
of human lifes,

1203
01:12:49,253 --> 01:12:52,133
and you have nothing to say?

1204
01:12:55,255 --> 01:12:59,655
(breathes strained)

1205
01:12:59,776 --> 01:13:02,776
Tach, Mr. Sti. . ., Um. ..
That's a coincidence! (Laughs)

1206
01:13:02,897 --> 01:13:04,376
Um. ..

1207
01:13:05,298 --> 01:13:08,538
Maybe I can later
invite you to a protein shake

1208
01:13:08,659 --> 01:13:10,859
and we can again
talk quietly about everything?

1209
01:13:10,979 --> 01:13:12,860
I'm here privately.

1210
01:13:12,981 --> 01:13:15,820
And I can not stand it,
when I am disturbed in my work-out.

1211
01:13:19,902 --> 01:13:21,382
You know what, Mr. Stiponski?

1212
01:13:21,503 --> 01:13:22,983
Nina was absolutely right.

1213
01:13:23,104 --> 01:13:25,223
You are a fucking puppet.

1214
01:13:26,025 --> 01:13:28,024
Let's see who's
the puppet here.

1215
01:13:32,307 --> 01:13:33,306
Philip!

1216
01:13:33,427 --> 01:13:35,547
- Niklas! Hey!
- Oh, Mary.

1217
01:13:35,667 --> 01:13:37,388
- You won't believe it!
- What?

1218
01:13:38,589 --> 01:13:40,068
- I got the part!
- The parte. ..

1219
01:13:40,189 --> 01:13:41,669
- Yes! Is it cool, right?
- The part!

1220
01:13:41,790 --> 01:13:44,270
So, the two of us will celebrate tonight.
Without you I would not have made it.

1221
01:13:44,391 --> 01:13:46,110
- No, I ...
- Do not argue.

1222
01:13:53,594 --> 01:13:55,914
Nik! You will not
risk everything now!

1223
01:13:56,034 --> 01:13:58,275
2 weeks before the wedding.
You can not be serious!

1224
01:13:58,395 --> 01:14:01,235
Now you let this tailless
Pasta Heini not spoil the fun.

1225
01:14:01,356 --> 01:14:02,835
Oh such empty.

1226
01:14:02,956 --> 01:14:04,956
Put on your apron if
someone shall take you serious.

1227
01:14:05,077 --> 01:14:06,877
- (Beep)
- Laura, it's me.

1228
01:14:06,998 --> 01:14:09,998
I must quickly go to Hamburg.
We have an agency meeting.

1229
01:14:10,119 --> 01:14:11,679
I'm back tomorrow morning.

1230
01:14:12,559 --> 01:14:14,040
Ok, then. ..

1231
01:14:14,920 --> 01:14:16,921
Until tomorrow, mouse. Kiss.

1232
01:14:18,682 --> 01:14:20,681
(Tires squeal)

1233
01:14:21,323 --> 01:14:24,563
No idea what's wrong with the fool.
We are done if he is not singing.

1234
01:14:24,684 --> 01:14:25,923
Talk with him!

1235
01:14:26,884 --> 01:14:28,604
We have no more time.

1236
01:14:28,725 --> 01:14:30,205
(Loudspeaker announcement)
'. . . In 5 minutes. '

1237
01:14:30,326 --> 01:14:31,805
(Sings) Aaa!

1238
01:14:33,966 --> 01:14:35,086
Siii!

1239
01:14:43,410 --> 01:14:45,409
Bruce, what's the matter?

1240
01:14:45,530 --> 01:14:48,410
- Suddenly I look so old.
- Oh papperlapapp!

1241
01:14:48,931 --> 01:14:50,651
I have a lousy feeling, Jerome.

1242
01:14:51,172 --> 01:14:53,172
I'm afraid I forget the lyrics.

1243
01:14:53,373 --> 01:14:55,252
Bruce, you're singing playback.

1244
01:14:56,014 --> 01:14:57,733
But what if people laugh?

1245
01:14:59,855 --> 01:15:02,975
Bruce, why should people laugh?

1246
01:15:03,456 --> 01:15:04,936
People love you!

1247
01:15:05,057 --> 01:15:08,297
You go out there and amazes
Millions of people, ok?

1248
01:15:08,418 --> 01:15:10,658
Bruce with your feeling,
with your voice.

1249
01:15:10,779 --> 01:15:13,258
With your great lyrics! Ok?

1250
01:15:14,380 --> 01:15:17,100
- You are my only friend, Jerome.
- Yes.

1251
01:15:18,621 --> 01:15:19,621
(Bruce) Oh!

1252
01:15:19,742 --> 01:15:23,662
(Small quiet sigh of Bruce)

1253
01:15:28,184 --> 01:15:29,864
(End of the race footsteps approach)

1254
01:15:29,985 --> 01:15:31,145
(clears throat)

1255
01:15:31,266 --> 01:15:32,264
(Woman) We have to!

1256
01:15:32,386 --> 01:15:33,505
(Sings) Aaa!

1257
01:15:34,066 --> 01:15:38,267
- The show must go on!
- Yeah! The show must go on!

1258
01:15:40,268 --> 01:15:43,508
(Sounds of techno music)

1259
01:16:02,195 --> 01:16:05,036
Jerome, I was on the phone with Heisel.

1260
01:16:08,117 --> 01:16:09,716
You got the deal.

1261
01:16:09,838 --> 01:16:11,637
(Laughs)

1262
01:16:11,759 --> 01:16:12,758
- Nope.
- Yes!

1263
01:16:12,878 --> 01:16:15,758
They give you a
half-million advance.

1264
01:16:15,880 --> 01:16:17,240
Half a million.

1265
01:16:17,361 --> 01:16:18,840
You are now one of the greats.

1266
01:16:18,961 --> 01:16:20,921
Yes, big time.

1267
01:16:21,842 --> 01:16:25,722
Oh! If that was not cool!

1268
01:16:25,843 --> 01:16:28,523
If that was not cool!

1269
01:16:28,643 --> 01:16:33,685
If this was not
top-tetra-mega-after-cool!

1270
01:16:34,246 --> 01:16:35,365
Wow!

1271
01:16:36,047 --> 01:16:39,646
(again loud techno music)

1272
01:16:56,453 --> 01:17:00,653
(Techno music now more in the background )

01:17:04,856 --> 01:17:06,855
(Mary squeals)

01:17:49,190 --> 01:17:52,430
(Quiet music begins)

1279
01:18:05,835 --> 01:18:07,315
I'm just not one of those guys

1280
01:18:07,436 --> 01:18:10,756
one of those fucking around.
I can not do that.

1281
01:18:10,877 --> 01:18:11,996
I can not cheat on Laura.

1282
01:18:12,117 --> 01:18:15,198
- Ah, you, uh, have you just done that?
- Yes!

1283
01:18:15,319 --> 01:18:17,679
Ah, no. Oh. ..

1284
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:20,599
I mean, if baggy pants,

1285
01:18:20,721 --> 01:18:23,841
But then the baggy pants of the woman,
which one is really close,

1286
01:18:23,962 --> 01:18:25,841
the one you really want to wake up with.

1287
01:18:25,962 --> 01:18:28,402
The special baggy pants.

1288
01:18:30,164 --> 01:18:31,483
I would love to go home immediately.

1289
01:18:33,205 --> 01:18:35,284
Hmmm. . . But I must stay here still,
otherwise it will be suspicous.

1290
01:18:35,405 --> 01:18:37,405
Buy her no flowers, by any means.

1291
01:18:37,526 --> 01:18:41,526
Say, Philip, have you already
used my bubble bath?

1292
01:18:41,647 --> 01:18:42,647
Hm?

1293
01:18:42,768 --> 01:18:43,847
I think this is really not ok.

1294
01:18:43,968 --> 01:18:45,648
And if the rent
is not paid next week,

1295
01:18:45,769 --> 01:18:48,248
I'll get you evicted. Because...

1296
01:18:52,771 --> 01:18:55,730
- Is that your famous business plan?
- Hm hm.

1297
01:18:59,373 --> 01:19:04,614
- Wow! Who has made the graphics?
- Nina.

1298
01:19:06,895 --> 01:19:09,416
She really tried hard.

1299
01:19:09,537 --> 01:19:12,016
- Want to have another coffee?
- Yes.

1300

("If You'll Be Mine" is on again)

1301

(Phone rings)

1302
01:19:40,147 --> 01:19:41,145
Hello, Philip.

1303
01:19:41,266 --> 01:19:43,746
Nina, I would like to
make one thing clear.

1304
01:19:45,268 --> 01:19:47,268
It is not true that I
am not interested in you.

1305
01:19:47,389 --> 01:19:50,669
I am very interested in you.
I now come to the kindergarten

1306
01:19:50,790 --> 01:19:54,270
and interrogate you. About your
Favorite color and shoe size

1307
01:19:54,391 --> 01:19:56,630
and when you name-day is
and things like that.

1308
01:19:56,752 --> 01:19:58,031
Are you stoned, Philip?

1309
01:19:58,152 --> 01:19:59,951
And I would like to clarify something.

1310
01:20:00,072 --> 01:20:02,392
I want the child because I want you,
Do you understand?

1311
01:20:02,514 --> 01:20:05,073
Because it's your child, our child.

1312
01:20:05,954 --> 01:20:07,074
I love you, Nina.

1313
01:20:07,195 --> 01:20:10,955
And somehow I always forget
to mention that I'm sorry.

1314
01:20:11,076 --> 01:20:12,555
- 'I love you!'
- (Brakes screech, scream)

(Clang,

(Ominous sounds)

1319
01:20:26,121 --> 01:20:27,881
Nina? What was that?

1320
01:20:31,563 --> 01:20:33,562
(Philip), 'Hello? Nina, '.

1321
01:20:34,483 --> 01:20:35,723
Shit!

1322
01:20:38,085 --> 01:20:39,204
Laura?

1323
01:20:40,726 --> 01:20:43,726
I've got a train earlier.
Do we have breakfast together?

1324
01:20:54,410 --> 01:20:55,410
Mouse?

1325
01:21:00,012 --> 01:21:03,172
(Stirring Music)

1326
01:21:12,256 --> 01:21:14,736
Hello? Hello!

1327
01:21:15,337 --> 01:21:17,137
I need a doctor!

1328
01:21:17,858 --> 01:21:20,338
Tell me, where have you been?
I was worried!

1329
01:21:20,458 --> 01:21:23,458
I was little partying with Caro,
for that we're both single again.

1330
01:21:23,580 --> 01:21:25,539
My Lord, I have a drunk skull.

1331
01:21:25,660 --> 01:21:27,820
What does that mean, "single"?

1332
01:21:32,223 --> 01:21:34,022
I did yesterday
call you in the office.

1333
01:21:34,144 --> 01:21:35,663
Me stupid cow wanted to know

1334
01:21:35,784 --> 01:21:38,303
what hotel you are in Hamburg
because I wanted to surprise you.

1335
01:21:43,426 --> 01:21:45,226
I do not know what to say.

1336
01:21:45,747 --> 01:21:49,108
You have nothing more to say, Niklas.
Pack your bags, you move out.

1337
01:21:50,388 --> 01:21:52,628
Laura. Laura, we are getting married in 2 weeks!

1338
01:21:52,749 --> 01:21:53,989
No, we do not.

1339
01:21:54,110 --> 01:21:55,909
Yesterday evening I did
sent out a collect mail.

1340
01:21:56,030 --> 01:21:57,430
- The wedding is canceled.
- What?

1341
01:21:57,551 --> 01:22:00,351
My mother probably gets
a heart attack, but what shall I do?

1342
01:22:00,472 --> 01:22:02,471
I also called Mrs. Koschinsky
and canceled the house.

1343
01:22:02,592 --> 01:22:05,553
You have to do the honeymoon
cancel, then you're done.

1344
01:22:05,674 --> 01:22:07,873
But. . . You can not
throw it all away now!

1345
01:22:07,994 --> 01:22:09,674
You said always. ..

1346
01:22:09,795 --> 01:22:12,074
What did I ever say Nicholas? What?

1347
01:22:14,116 --> 01:22:16,236
You always had the plan.
From the very beginning.

1348
01:22:16,357 --> 01:22:19,317
You wanted to move in together, you
wanted to get engaged and buy a house

1349
01:22:19,437 --> 01:22:22,317
all this shit Civil way
Do you think I like,

sitting around in 'suburban home
at 40 with a toddler (small kid)

1351

while you run after some hores
and cheat on me,

1352
01:22:27,521 --> 01:22:29,520
until we meet again in court?

1353
01:22:31,202 --> 01:22:32,521
Do you think I like that?

1355
01:22:41,685 --> 01:22:42,804

- Hey, Gunther!
- What are you up to ..

1358
01:22:47,207 --> 01:22:51,207
Hello! Well, that's a...
Surprise.

1359
01:22:51,328 --> 01:22:55,128
Since I am not familiar with,
such a situation.

1360
01:22:56,570 --> 01:22:59,570
I should have known that,
I can meet you here.

1361
01:23:00,131 --> 01:23:01,371
Yes.

Ah. ..

1364
01:23:06,493 --> 01:23:09,093
We wanted to go to the crocodiles.
Would you like to join?

1365
01:23:10,054 --> 01:23:11,534
- To the crocodiles?
- Yes.

1366
01:23:11,695 --> 01:23:13,175
(With pieping voice) Yes! Yes!

1367
01:23:13,296 --> 01:23:14,775
(clears throat) Ah, yes, yes.

1368
01:23:15,416 --> 01:23:18,176
But you must tell
me something! Anything!

1369
01:23:18,297 --> 01:23:19,976
Please wait over there.

1370
01:23:20,097 --> 01:23:21,577
Dr. Bahar will later
talk to you.

1371
01:23:21,699 --> 01:23:23,938
Mrs. Hellmich is currently operated.

1372
01:23:37,143 --> 01:23:38,622
Are you her friend?

1373
01:23:42,505 --> 01:23:43,984
It was.

1374
01:23:44,706 --> 01:23:45,945
I've hit her with the car

1375

I have not seen her.

1376
01:23:48,547 --> 01:23:50,666
I'm so sorry.

1377

She is pregnant, man.

Oh, God. ..

1379
01:24:00,831 --> 01:24:03,310
Can we please go to the sharks again?

1380
01:24:04,072 --> 01:24:06,071
Yes, children, just go.

1381
01:24:10,394 --> 01:24:12,394
Did you know that crocodiles
evolutionary

1382
01:24:12,514 --> 01:24:13,994
belong to the species of birds?

I'm sorry, Manfred, however. ..

is just not my thing.

I do not want this no more.

1434

I can not do that anymore.

1435

It's all ok, Jerome.

1436

I'm terribly sorry that you
have been drawn in to that, Guenther.

I see it positive.

Otherwise you would not
be here right now, Susanne.

Also, I just want to say.

1452
01:28:38,081 --> 01:28:39,561
Not everyone can rightfully claim that,

1453
01:28:39,682 --> 01:28:42,402
he at some time fought with
a crocodile and survived.

1454

How did you do that actually?

1455
01:28:47,604 --> 01:28:48,923
I used to do Judo earlier.

but. ..

1461
01:29:14,813 --> 01:29:16,652
Believe me, there's always a comeback.

1462
01:29:18,694 --> 01:29:19,933
Always.

1463
01:29:20,175 --> 01:29:22,174
I think I'll go hoem first...

your face when you wake up,
