1
00:04:00,155 --> 00:04:02,907
Amy.

2
00:04:04,367 --> 00:04:06,119
It's Dad.

3
00:04:06,369 --> 00:04:09,038
Dad?

4
00:04:09,289 --> 00:04:12,625
Why are you here?

5
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:17,714
I came down from Canada.

6
00:04:19,174 --> 00:04:22,760
I've come to take you home.

7
00:04:23,553 --> 00:04:25,471
What do you mean?

8
00:04:25,722 --> 00:04:30,018
- Well, I mean...
- Where's Mum?

9
00:04:35,315 --> 00:04:38,359
Tell me.

10
00:04:38,776 --> 00:04:42,530
Mum died, didn't she?

11
00:05:05,344 --> 00:05:09,640
There was a foot of snow here
when I left.

12
00:05:14,103 --> 00:05:17,898
I apologise for the mess.
I haven't had a...

13
00:05:18,149 --> 00:05:20,776
I haven't had a chance to clean up.

14
00:05:21,026 --> 00:05:24,822
I've been really busy with, you know,
this, that, the other thing.

15
00:05:25,072 --> 00:05:31,412
I haven't done any work to speak of
on the house in nine years.

16
00:05:31,662 --> 00:05:36,125
It'll be really nice
once it's all finished.

17
00:05:38,586 --> 00:05:42,381
Trunk. I'll get the trunk.

18
00:05:53,559 --> 00:05:57,396
Well, the bed looks nice.

19
00:05:58,313 --> 00:06:01,900
I ran out of storage space
in the workshop.

20
00:06:02,151 --> 00:06:04,611
I'll clear the junk out
in the morning.

21
00:06:04,862 --> 00:06:07,906
- Make it just like you remember it.
- I don't.

22
00:06:08,157 --> 00:06:11,034
You don't what?

23
00:06:11,285 --> 00:06:14,288
Remember it.

24
00:06:22,754 --> 00:06:24,840
I'm really tired.

25
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:27,843
Yeah.

26
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:38,270
Good night.

27
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:46,724
You didn't think I could fly, did you?

28
00:10:46,974 --> 00:10:48,476
What did you think?

29
00:10:48,726 --> 00:10:51,562
I wouldn't go and brag about it.

30
00:10:51,813 --> 00:10:57,485
Oh, well, that's actually
a pretty good landing for me.

31
00:11:00,196 --> 00:11:03,074
He's headed to a museum in Montreal.

32
00:11:03,324 --> 00:11:07,453
I was thinking:
A goatee or clean-shaven?

33
00:11:07,703 --> 00:11:11,916
Give him a beard.
Then he'll look like you.

34
00:11:15,711 --> 00:11:18,089
I'm gonna be real busy.

35
00:11:18,339 --> 00:11:23,552
I'm behind.
I gotta deliver him and...

36
00:11:24,845 --> 00:11:27,223
I'm gonna be in the shop a lot.

37
00:11:27,473 --> 00:11:30,226
Okay?

38
00:11:30,726 --> 00:11:35,731
I'm not a baby.
You don't have to hold my hand.

39
00:12:31,119 --> 00:12:34,706
- What's that?
- I won an award for that.

40
00:12:34,957 --> 00:12:38,543
From the Canadian Society
of Inventors. Not bad, eh?

41
00:12:38,794 --> 00:12:43,215
- What is it?
- It's a refrigerator.

42
00:12:45,217 --> 00:12:48,428
Very original.

43
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,933
Moo goo gai in a pan.

44
00:12:53,183 --> 00:12:56,686
It's real easy to make.
It says so right here.

45
00:12:56,937 --> 00:13:00,524
You like peanut butter? Remember,
it had a real peanutty taste?

46
00:13:00,774 --> 00:13:03,944
- I'm not eating that.
- The peanut butter makes it good.

47
00:13:04,194 --> 00:13:07,989
The peanuts, there's
an oil thing that happens.

48
00:13:08,239 --> 00:13:10,575
Why is a spaceship in the barn?

49
00:13:10,825 --> 00:13:13,119
That's the Lunar Lander.

50
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:17,791
Remember when I built that?
It was the winter...

51
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:21,169
...you and your mom...

52
00:13:21,961 --> 00:13:23,797
You and your mom left.

53
00:13:24,047 --> 00:13:27,258
Remember, she thought
I was crazy for doing it.

54
00:13:27,509 --> 00:13:31,971
I was too.
I had no money and a busted ankle.

55
00:13:32,222 --> 00:13:35,349
Colder than hell.

56
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:39,604
But I just couldn't get over
that whole moon trip.

57
00:13:39,854 --> 00:13:43,274
Why did you build it?

58
00:13:43,691 --> 00:13:47,528
The Lunar Lander, think about it.
It's up there right now.

59
00:13:47,779 --> 00:13:51,991
The original one.
They left it there. It's parked.

60
00:13:52,241 --> 00:13:57,747
So we needed another one.
So I made an exact replica.

61
00:13:57,997 --> 00:14:00,875
Yeah. Every home should have one.

62
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:04,754
I've been offered a lot for that.

63
00:14:13,387 --> 00:14:15,514
Hi.

64
00:14:15,765 --> 00:14:18,893
You must be Amy.
I've heard a lot about you.

65
00:14:19,143 --> 00:14:24,148
Hey, how you doing?
This is Susan, a friend of mine.

66
00:14:26,359 --> 00:14:29,195
This is for you.

67
00:14:29,445 --> 00:14:31,781
It's a welcome...

68
00:14:32,031 --> 00:14:35,409
...gift. Welcome.

69
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:45,961
Do you live here too?

70
00:14:46,754 --> 00:14:48,923
Well...

71
00:14:49,173 --> 00:14:50,799
Yes, I do.

72
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:54,511
Sometimes I do.

73
00:14:54,762 --> 00:14:57,932
Excuse me.

74
00:15:01,685 --> 00:15:05,230
So, what's cooking?

75
00:15:12,571 --> 00:15:15,324
So! That went well.

76
00:15:19,787 --> 00:15:22,915
...clearing the corner,
fixing the bed, the flowers...

77
00:15:23,165 --> 00:15:26,585
...and everything.
I mean, it's just great.

78
00:15:26,835 --> 00:15:32,131
- No problem.
- We were really beat when we got back.

79
00:15:32,132 --> 00:15:35,594
She's different
than I thought she'd be.

80
00:15:35,844 --> 00:15:39,431
More complicated.

81
00:15:40,682 --> 00:15:45,270
She used to travel all over
and tour with her mother.

82
00:15:45,312 --> 00:15:48,148
Singing in a club in Tokyo.

83
00:15:48,398 --> 00:15:51,902
A week later, recording in London.

84
00:15:52,152 --> 00:15:55,489
They were on the move a lot.

85
00:18:24,636 --> 00:18:26,555
Get out of here!

86
00:18:26,805 --> 00:18:29,475
What do you think you're doing?

87
00:18:29,725 --> 00:18:34,271
Hey! What do you think you're doing?

88
00:18:34,605 --> 00:18:38,692
We haven't had the meeting yet!
We haven't voted!

89
00:18:38,942 --> 00:18:42,154
You're totally illegal!

90
00:18:47,117 --> 00:18:51,204
I'm gonna get a lawyer
and sue your ass!

91
00:19:01,923 --> 00:19:02,924
Amy.

92
00:19:03,175 --> 00:19:05,594
Amy, look.

93
00:19:05,844 --> 00:19:08,263
I'm sorry about that
but these people...

94
00:19:08,513 --> 00:19:10,557
They want to build this development.

95
00:19:10,807 --> 00:19:14,603
We've been fighting them because
it's going to ruin the community.

96
00:19:14,853 --> 00:19:16,396
I don't care.

97
00:19:16,646 --> 00:19:21,276
Yeah, well, okay. I just wanted
to explain it you. That's all.

98
00:19:21,526 --> 00:19:26,072
I don't care about any of it.
I'm not going back to school anymore.

99
00:19:26,323 --> 00:19:30,326
- I'd rather die than go back there.
- Amy.

100
00:19:34,998 --> 00:19:39,043
Why did all this have to happen?

101
00:23:38,197 --> 00:23:40,616
Who are you?

102
00:23:40,866 --> 00:23:43,452
They were coming at me
through the frozen food section.

103
00:23:43,703 --> 00:23:49,709
It was just truly awful.
Their lips were so blue.

104
00:23:50,876 --> 00:23:53,879
- Oh, wow! You gotta be Amy.
- Yeah.

105
00:23:54,130 --> 00:23:58,592
I gave you Silly Putty
for Christmas once. You ate it.

106
00:23:58,843 --> 00:24:00,177
You remember, Tom?

107
00:24:00,427 --> 00:24:03,639
She took a bite of a slipper once.
Swallowed it.

108
00:24:03,889 --> 00:24:05,307
What's he doing here?

109
00:24:05,558 --> 00:24:08,227
He's your uncle.
He's helping me catch up.

110
00:24:08,477 --> 00:24:10,938
Tom uses me as his beast of burden.

111
00:24:11,188 --> 00:24:15,359
I lug pig iron for Michelangelo.

112
00:24:15,609 --> 00:24:17,319
- That's the bus.
- Dad, no.

113
00:24:17,569 --> 00:24:20,489
- Books, shoes, hat, bag.
- No, no, Dad.

114
00:24:20,739 --> 00:24:22,449
- Where's your bag?
- Wait, listen...

115
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:24,076
David's got the bag.

116
00:24:24,326 --> 00:24:25,953
- Homework!
- Dad, I've got...

117
00:24:26,203 --> 00:24:28,414
- We're coming. We're coming!
- Dad!

118
00:24:28,664 --> 00:24:30,457
- Okay, go.
- Just wait a minute.

119
00:24:30,707 --> 00:24:35,003
You're going to school. You belong
in school, every day. Period. Go!

120
00:24:35,254 --> 00:24:38,173
- Go, go, go, go.
- Oh, Dad!

121
00:24:38,423 --> 00:24:41,718
Today, I want to move on
to another important figure:

122
00:24:41,969 --> 00:24:44,888
Sir Allan Napier McNab.

123
00:24:45,138 --> 00:24:46,974
Sir Allan was elected...

124
00:24:47,224 --> 00:24:50,352
...to the Upper Canada
Legislative Assembly...

125
00:24:50,602 --> 00:24:53,063
...in 1830.

126
00:24:53,313 --> 00:24:54,731
He was its speaker...

127
00:24:54,982 --> 00:24:58,860
...from 1837 to 1840...

128
00:24:59,111 --> 00:25:02,572
...while the Tories
were in the majority.

129
00:25:02,823 --> 00:25:05,033
<i>And he was the Prime Minister...</i>

130
00:25:05,283 --> 00:25:07,577
<i>... of the United Colony...</i>

131
00:25:07,828 --> 00:25:14,793
<i>... from 1854 until 1856...</i>

132
00:25:40,777 --> 00:25:42,487
Amy!

133
00:25:42,737 --> 00:25:43,738
Hi.

134
00:25:43,988 --> 00:25:46,241
Hey. How'd it go today?

135
00:25:46,491 --> 00:25:48,952
- Quite awful, thank you.
- Sorry to hear that.

136
00:25:49,202 --> 00:25:51,412
It'll be better tomorrow, I'm sure.

137
00:25:51,663 --> 00:25:53,998
Susan and I are going to a meeting.

138
00:25:54,249 --> 00:25:56,376
Uncle Dave is gonna stay
and feed you...

139
00:25:56,626 --> 00:26:00,171
...help you with your homework.
Math tonight, right?

140
00:26:00,421 --> 00:26:02,465
- We'll be home by 10.
- Don't worry.

141
00:26:02,715 --> 00:26:04,384
Be in bed by 8:30!

142
00:26:04,634 --> 00:26:07,220
What, decimals? Fractions?

143
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:11,516
Math can be really fun.
It really can.

144
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:52,807
Call him on that!

145
00:28:02,125 --> 00:28:05,754
By destroying the marsh, they've
accomplished their objective...

146
00:28:06,004 --> 00:28:08,423
...which is, there's
nothing left to save.

147
00:28:08,674 --> 00:28:10,592
It's a done deal.

148
00:28:10,842 --> 00:28:13,428
And it's an outrage!

149
00:28:13,678 --> 00:28:15,305
There are laws against this.

150
00:28:15,555 --> 00:28:20,393
I want to know who amongst you
is going to enforce them?

151
00:28:21,019 --> 00:28:24,439
The Chair recognizes Sam Tufts.

152
00:28:24,689 --> 00:28:26,525
Sir...

153
00:28:26,775 --> 00:28:31,238
...I'm proud to be one
of the "they" you speak of.

154
00:28:31,488 --> 00:28:34,699
As a farmer, I don't have
the luxury of an outside income.

155
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:38,703
My land is part of the package
because I can't make a living off it.

156
00:28:38,954 --> 00:28:41,748
If I don't sell, how will I
send my kids to college?

157
00:28:41,998 --> 00:28:44,292
The Chair recognizes Glenn Seiferts.

158
00:28:44,542 --> 00:28:47,629
I'd like to say it's not
this project that worries me...

159
00:28:47,879 --> 00:28:50,715
...as much as the ones
that'll follow in its wake.

160
00:28:50,965 --> 00:28:53,927
I don't believe many of you
want this to happen.

161
00:28:54,177 --> 00:28:58,598
I wish you'd consider the fields
and streams your children play in.

162
00:28:58,848 --> 00:29:01,935
The clean air, the clean water...

163
00:29:02,185 --> 00:29:06,439
...the general peace of mind.
And let's not forget the animals.

164
00:29:06,689 --> 00:29:12,153
They're on the brink of leaving here
forever if this permit is passed...

165
00:29:12,403 --> 00:29:15,239
<i>... so think about it.</i>

166
00:29:18,618 --> 00:29:21,746
- But you tried!
- I have enough to deal with.

167
00:29:21,996 --> 00:29:25,458
- I've got enough on my...
- Shh!

168
00:29:27,251 --> 00:29:30,463
Hey. How you doing?

169
00:29:30,713 --> 00:29:34,008
What time did she go to sleep?

170
00:29:36,886 --> 00:29:40,848
What time did she go to sleep?

171
00:29:41,098 --> 00:29:44,268
Amy!

172
00:29:44,518 --> 00:29:47,980
Amy!

173
00:29:53,778 --> 00:29:57,782
I don't even remember falling asleep.

174
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:30,481
Well, now we know why
she was going to the marsh.

175
00:30:30,731 --> 00:30:36,612
- Is it okay for her to sleep here?
- Oh, yeah. She'll be okay.

176
00:30:56,173 --> 00:31:00,969
Can I keep them? Please?

177
00:31:05,933 --> 00:31:08,935
Hi, guys.

178
00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:38,048
Good morning.

179
00:31:40,342 --> 00:31:43,053
You've got to feed them
every two hours.

180
00:31:43,303 --> 00:31:44,304
Okay.

181
00:31:44,554 --> 00:31:46,765
And they need a lot of attention.

182
00:31:47,015 --> 00:31:49,517
What they need is to learn
where to poop.

183
00:31:49,768 --> 00:31:52,771
Come on, they're just babies.

184
00:31:53,021 --> 00:31:56,524
Look, they're not going to be able
to stay in the house.

185
00:31:56,775 --> 00:32:00,987
If you put them outside, owls and cats
will get them. And they'll die!

186
00:32:01,237 --> 00:32:05,283
- There's your bus. You've gotta go.
- Are you sure you can handle this?

187
00:32:05,533 --> 00:32:07,660
Yes, I'm sure. Okay?

188
00:32:07,911 --> 00:32:11,873
Go to school. Go. Now!

189
00:32:27,847 --> 00:32:30,475
I hear they postponed
building for a year.

190
00:32:30,725 --> 00:32:33,227
Who knows? I don't believe it.

191
00:32:33,478 --> 00:32:36,689
My daughter found some goose eggs
in that mess.

192
00:32:36,939 --> 00:32:40,860
They wiped out some birds
when they went through there.

193
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:46,490
They hatched, now I've got fuzzballs
in my house. I don't know what to do.

194
00:32:46,741 --> 00:32:50,953
- Wild geese, yeah.
- Yeah.

195
00:32:51,787 --> 00:32:55,458
That was one of the last nesting
places for them in the area.

196
00:32:55,708 --> 00:32:59,879
- You just inherited more problems.
- Great.

197
00:33:00,129 --> 00:33:02,340
Geese learn from their parents.

198
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:06,635
Everything from what to eat,
how to fly, when to migrate.

199
00:33:06,886 --> 00:33:08,137
When do they migrate?

200
00:33:08,387 --> 00:33:12,391
Late fall. But without
the parental influence...

201
00:33:12,641 --> 00:33:16,645
...they'll get the urge to fly,
but won't know where they're going.

202
00:33:16,896 --> 00:33:21,525
- How do I take care of them?
- A little grass and grain for now.

203
00:33:21,775 --> 00:33:26,238
I'll come by in a couple days and see
what you got, and if I can help.

204
00:33:26,488 --> 00:33:29,867
- That would be great.
- Good.

205
00:33:45,174 --> 00:33:50,387
Hey, hey. Come on, goose.
Hey, goose.

206
00:34:26,673 --> 00:34:30,927
- How old is she?
- Thirteen.

207
00:34:31,178 --> 00:34:33,513
They grow up quick, don't they?

208
00:34:33,763 --> 00:34:35,265
I wouldn't know.

209
00:34:35,515 --> 00:34:38,727
It's amazing how they follow her
around like that.

210
00:34:38,977 --> 00:34:41,646
Yeah. It's called "imprinting".

211
00:34:41,897 --> 00:34:46,860
The first living thing a goose sees
it assumes is its mother.

212
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:50,447
They'll follow her anywhere.

213
00:35:04,669 --> 00:35:09,257
It's important to note
that geese are tough birds.

214
00:35:09,507 --> 00:35:12,927
The way they've been displaced,
I'm amazed they're not extinct.

215
00:35:13,178 --> 00:35:15,180
But they've learned to adapt.

216
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:17,724
Where do they go?

217
00:35:17,974 --> 00:35:21,895
That's the problem.
I get calls all the time.

218
00:35:22,145 --> 00:35:26,482
They land on people's front lawns,
the golf course...

219
00:35:26,733 --> 00:35:29,277
That's why we have Ordinance 9314.

220
00:35:29,527 --> 00:35:30,778
Ordinance what?

221
00:35:31,029 --> 00:35:33,322
Ordinance 9314:

222
00:35:33,573 --> 00:35:38,619
"All domestically raised geese
have to be rendered flightless."

223
00:35:38,786 --> 00:35:42,582
It's better known as "pinioning".

224
00:35:42,874 --> 00:35:46,711
It's actually a simple procedure.

225
00:35:46,961 --> 00:35:48,379
It's quite painless.

226
00:35:48,629 --> 00:35:51,299
What do we have here?
Come here, guy.

227
00:35:51,549 --> 00:35:53,134
Please leave him alone.

228
00:35:53,384 --> 00:35:57,138
Your name's Amy, right?
Amy, these geese belong to the Crown.

229
00:35:57,388 --> 00:35:59,432
- What Crown?
- Queen of England.

230
00:35:59,682 --> 00:36:02,935
- Pinioning?
- I had no idea.

231
00:36:03,185 --> 00:36:05,980
It's for the good of the goose
and the people.

232
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:10,276
You take the wing and just shave
a bit off the cuticle here.

233
00:36:10,526 --> 00:36:14,989
What are you doing?! Stop it!
Stop it!

234
00:36:15,781 --> 00:36:19,285
What the hell are you doing?

235
00:36:19,618 --> 00:36:21,954
- Watch out!
- Easy.

236
00:36:22,204 --> 00:36:25,290
What are you doing?

237
00:36:25,291 --> 00:36:27,751
What the hell are you doing?

238
00:36:28,002 --> 00:36:30,671
What's wrong? I'm trying to help.

239
00:36:30,921 --> 00:36:35,092
What happens when they start to fly?
What happens when they migrate?

240
00:36:35,342 --> 00:36:37,928
They'll be zapped in power lines.

241
00:36:38,178 --> 00:36:40,306
- Get off my land!
- Listen!

242
00:36:40,556 --> 00:36:43,600
They could be carrying parasites
and disease...

243
00:36:43,851 --> 00:36:46,020
Stay off of my place!

244
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:49,606
They'll be clipped, no matter what!

245
00:36:53,694 --> 00:36:58,490
If they fly, I'll confiscate them.

246
00:37:01,076 --> 00:37:03,704
Amy.

247
00:37:04,246 --> 00:37:08,917
Amy, I'm sorry. I didn't know
he was going to do that.

248
00:37:09,167 --> 00:37:16,133
I promise I won't let anybody
hurt them, all right? Open the door.

249
00:37:48,415 --> 00:37:53,628
She's your daughter.
You have to figure it out yourself.

250
00:37:55,964 --> 00:38:00,552
I've tried everything.
I've been nice to her.

251
00:38:00,802 --> 00:38:05,014
I've been tough on her.
Nothing's worked.

252
00:38:08,351 --> 00:38:11,646
I think the bottom line is...

253
00:38:11,896 --> 00:38:14,899
...that she doesn't want to be here.

254
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:19,362
And I'm no better father now
than I was when she was 3.

255
00:38:19,612 --> 00:38:24,200
- At least you're here.
- Yeah, I'm here.

256
00:38:32,542 --> 00:38:35,461
It's okay.

257
00:38:39,298 --> 00:38:41,551
Thomas!

258
00:38:41,801 --> 00:38:45,054
Hey, Barry!

259
00:38:45,847 --> 00:38:47,140
How you doing?

260
00:38:47,390 --> 00:38:48,850
Good.

261
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:52,061
- I got those battens for you.
- Thank you.

262
00:38:52,311 --> 00:38:54,272
You've missed some good flying.

263
00:38:54,522 --> 00:38:57,900
I got this straight-up elevator
off a cliff burble...

264
00:38:58,150 --> 00:39:01,988
...I must have gone up 2000 feet
in a minute.

265
00:39:02,238 --> 00:39:03,990
Where is this place?

266
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,492
It's 52 miles.
I got my bird in the truck.

267
00:39:06,742 --> 00:39:11,831
I can't.
I got a bit of a crisis here.

268
00:39:12,081 --> 00:39:16,335
- You want some coffee?
- Yeah, sure.

269
00:39:44,905 --> 00:39:47,825
Amy!

270
00:40:04,883 --> 00:40:06,051
Get out!

271
00:40:06,301 --> 00:40:10,347
It's the compressor! I just...

272
00:40:11,723 --> 00:40:15,519
- It's the compressor!
- Get out!

273
00:40:15,769 --> 00:40:20,524
- Get out!
- It's the compressor!

274
00:40:29,574 --> 00:40:31,702
- He's so weird!
- You're right, he is.

275
00:40:31,952 --> 00:40:35,747
I miss my friends and my room.
Who was that guy?

276
00:40:35,997 --> 00:40:37,791
Just a guy. He didn't see you.

277
00:40:38,041 --> 00:40:39,918
- He did too!
- No, he didn't.

278
00:40:40,168 --> 00:40:42,003
- He did.
- No.

279
00:40:42,254 --> 00:40:45,132
Why did he bring
a man to chop their wings off?

280
00:40:45,382 --> 00:40:47,300
Your father didn't know.

281
00:40:47,551 --> 00:40:50,762
- He did, and he's coming back.
- No, he's not.

282
00:40:51,012 --> 00:40:54,933
- Amy, listen to me. Listen to me!
- No! No!

283
00:40:55,183 --> 00:40:58,561
I know I can't replace your mother.
Nobody can.

284
00:40:58,812 --> 00:41:02,399
But if you let me,
I can be your friend.

285
00:41:02,649 --> 00:41:07,362
The first rule of friends is
they have to trust each other.

286
00:41:07,612 --> 00:41:12,409
I promise you, nothing is going
to happen to those geese. Nothing.

287
00:41:12,659 --> 00:41:18,289
I won't let it, and neither
will your dad. It's a promise.

288
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:21,668
Okay?

289
00:42:10,007 --> 00:42:12,051
- See that weld?
- I see your finger.

290
00:42:12,301 --> 00:42:15,096
- It's dark!
- No, it's behind there. The weld.

291
00:42:15,346 --> 00:42:17,932
I got it.

292
00:43:12,528 --> 00:43:16,156
How fast do they fly again?

293
00:43:17,032 --> 00:43:20,661
- Thirty-one miles an hour.
- Oh, God, there's no way!

294
00:43:20,911 --> 00:43:21,995
Yeah, it's slow.

295
00:43:22,246 --> 00:43:26,291
- Makes for a really slow aeroplane.
- They're aerodynamically perfect.

296
00:43:26,541 --> 00:43:30,253
What's that principle?
The guy that...

297
00:43:30,504 --> 00:43:32,798
- Bernoulli.
- Bernoulli.

298
00:43:33,048 --> 00:43:38,428
If the wing is curved, airflow moves
faster over the top. It goes farther.

299
00:43:38,678 --> 00:43:41,973
Less pressure on top,
ergo lift...

300
00:43:42,224 --> 00:43:44,392
...ergo flight.

301
00:43:44,643 --> 00:43:47,104
Ergo...

302
00:43:47,354 --> 00:43:50,357
Ergo what?

303
00:43:59,032 --> 00:44:01,243
Have you turned the gas on, Tom?

304
00:44:01,493 --> 00:44:03,620
Yeah, now it's on.

305
00:44:03,870 --> 00:44:05,622
Turn it off.

306
00:44:05,872 --> 00:44:08,917
Make up your mind.

307
00:44:09,042 --> 00:44:12,337
Turn it off until the engine starts.

308
00:44:12,587 --> 00:44:15,382
Then turn it back on.

309
00:44:20,136 --> 00:44:23,598
This is the kill switch. Clamp it
in your teeth. If you crash...

310
00:44:23,848 --> 00:44:28,394
...your jaw relaxes.
You won't get cut up too bad.

311
00:44:28,645 --> 00:44:32,690
- Fly on, boys!
- Everybody clear?

312
00:45:07,433 --> 00:45:11,270
- We need a bigger engine.
- Yeah.

313
00:45:18,778 --> 00:45:20,112
Wake up.

314
00:45:20,363 --> 00:45:23,366
Hey, hey.

315
00:45:27,203 --> 00:45:29,538
Hey, guys.

316
00:45:29,789 --> 00:45:32,750
Hey, guys, come on.

317
00:45:38,255 --> 00:45:42,760
Hey, geese, come on!
Come on, geese! Come on, geese!

318
00:45:57,733 --> 00:46:00,402
Come on.

319
00:46:00,653 --> 00:46:02,863
You could fly real high with this.

320
00:46:03,113 --> 00:46:05,199
Or end up a pile of ground round.

321
00:46:05,449 --> 00:46:09,661
There's only one way to find out.

322
00:46:25,886 --> 00:46:29,681
Come on, Tom. Come on!

323
00:46:41,902 --> 00:46:45,113
Oh, God!

324
00:46:47,616 --> 00:46:50,619
Oh, my. What a ride!

325
00:46:50,869 --> 00:46:53,497
My feet can't take this anymore.

326
00:46:53,747 --> 00:46:55,999
- See that one?
- This one?

327
00:46:56,249 --> 00:46:57,751
That one's Fluffy.

328
00:46:58,001 --> 00:47:01,421
- And that one's Feather brain.
- Feather brain?

329
00:47:01,671 --> 00:47:05,091
And that's Grumpy. He likes mud.

330
00:47:05,342 --> 00:47:06,676
What's that little guy's name?

331
00:47:06,927 --> 00:47:10,764
This one? I haven't thought
of a name yet.

332
00:47:11,014 --> 00:47:16,227
He was born with a limp,
so maybe I'll call him Gimpy.

333
00:47:16,478 --> 00:47:20,940
That's pretty good.
It might give him a complex, though.

334
00:47:21,191 --> 00:47:24,486
You might think of something
more strong.

335
00:47:24,736 --> 00:47:28,740
Like John, or Thor.

336
00:47:28,990 --> 00:47:32,619
Mac, or something.
Oh, I got it. Igor!

337
00:47:32,869 --> 00:47:33,953
- Igor?
- Yeah.

338
00:47:34,204 --> 00:47:37,290
Like in "Frankenstein":

339
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:41,377
"Master. Master, follow me!"
You know?

340
00:47:41,628 --> 00:47:44,047
That's good. I like it. "Igor".

341
00:47:44,297 --> 00:47:47,425
"It's alive!" You know.

342
00:48:45,941 --> 00:48:48,194
I had this idea...

343
00:48:48,444 --> 00:48:50,905
...about the geese.

344
00:48:51,155 --> 00:48:55,284
I've been watching the way
they've been following you.

345
00:48:55,534 --> 00:48:57,202
Even when you're
on your four-wheeler.

346
00:48:57,453 --> 00:49:02,583
It occurred to me that they just might
follow my aeroplane too.

347
00:49:02,833 --> 00:49:04,877
- No way.
- Amy, look.

348
00:49:05,127 --> 00:49:07,921
They're gonna try to fly away.
That's what they do.

349
00:49:08,172 --> 00:49:09,173
They're migratory.

350
00:49:09,423 --> 00:49:13,135
They go south in the winter, just as
their ancestors have always done.

351
00:49:13,385 --> 00:49:14,887
So?

352
00:49:15,137 --> 00:49:17,431
We can keep them in the barn.

353
00:49:17,681 --> 00:49:22,478
Sure, we could do that.
It's kind of like jail.

354
00:49:22,936 --> 00:49:26,231
We could also clip their wings.

355
00:49:26,607 --> 00:49:27,774
Doesn't matter.

356
00:49:28,025 --> 00:49:32,404
They'll want to go south, where
it's warm and there's plenty to eat.

357
00:49:32,654 --> 00:49:38,285
I could show them the way
by flying with them in my plane.

358
00:49:38,535 --> 00:49:42,205
My geese won't have anything to do
with your crazy ideas.

359
00:49:42,456 --> 00:49:46,376
She's right, Thomas.
This one is way out there.

360
00:49:46,626 --> 00:49:49,129
Okay, look. But this could work.

361
00:49:49,379 --> 00:49:51,006
According to the books...

362
00:49:51,256 --> 00:49:54,843
...they learn the landscape
by following their parents.

363
00:49:55,093 --> 00:49:58,305
In the spring, they come back
by the same route...

364
00:49:58,555 --> 00:50:00,849
...exactly, to the same place.

365
00:50:01,099 --> 00:50:03,268
Right there on the front porch.

366
00:50:03,518 --> 00:50:05,979
Our problem is that your birds...

367
00:50:06,229 --> 00:50:09,107
...don't have anybody
to show them the way.

368
00:50:09,357 --> 00:50:14,654
So they'll take off and get lost,
or get shot by hunters, or worse.

369
00:50:14,904 --> 00:50:17,866
They're not gonna follow you.

370
00:50:23,872 --> 00:50:27,417
But they might if you help me.

371
00:50:29,627 --> 00:50:31,546
Believe me, this could work.

372
00:50:31,796 --> 00:50:35,550
I promise you, it'll be okay.

373
00:50:40,430 --> 00:50:43,183
I promise.

374
00:51:43,242 --> 00:51:46,662
Come on, guys. Come on.

375
00:53:05,407 --> 00:53:09,661
<i>That was close.
We'll get it.</i>

376
00:53:27,971 --> 00:53:31,558
Hey, guys! Come on!

377
00:54:14,934 --> 00:54:19,981
It seemed so perfect. I'm used to
my ideas not working out at first.

378
00:54:20,231 --> 00:54:23,109
Yeah, but she's not used to it.

379
00:54:23,359 --> 00:54:28,447
You got her all excited about this.
Now she feels like you let her down...

380
00:54:28,698 --> 00:54:31,617
...again.

381
00:54:37,039 --> 00:54:40,334
Broken promises are the worst.
It's better not to promise.

382
00:54:40,584 --> 00:54:47,258
I'm having trouble figuring it out.
I didn't say I was giving up...

383
00:55:13,409 --> 00:55:16,453
Amy!

384
00:55:18,914 --> 00:55:21,875
Amy!

385
00:55:37,140 --> 00:55:40,978
Oh, God. Amy, please.

386
00:55:43,146 --> 00:55:46,817
Talk to me. Talk to me, Amy.

387
00:55:47,067 --> 00:55:50,862
- Hi.
- Oh, God!

388
00:55:53,156 --> 00:55:55,575
Oh, sweetie. Are you hurt?

389
00:55:55,826 --> 00:55:58,995
I don't think so.

390
00:56:00,956 --> 00:56:04,042
You're crying.

391
00:56:04,126 --> 00:56:07,963
Yeah, I thought you were...

392
00:56:31,236 --> 00:56:34,823
<i>Suppose I built another aircraft.</i>

393
00:56:35,073 --> 00:56:39,244
And then taught Amy how to fly it.

394
00:56:40,703 --> 00:56:42,247
What?

395
00:56:42,497 --> 00:56:47,335
Look, the birds will fly with her,
she'll fly with me.

396
00:56:47,585 --> 00:56:49,045
I could lead them all south.

397
00:56:49,295 --> 00:56:52,590
You're joking, right?

398
00:56:53,466 --> 00:56:57,470
She nearly broke her neck yesterday.
This is a joke, right?

399
00:56:57,720 --> 00:56:59,681
No, it's not.

400
00:56:59,931 --> 00:57:02,892
It's a great idea.
We can make it work.

401
00:57:03,142 --> 00:57:06,521
The birds follow me, I follow you.
We all go south.

402
00:57:06,771 --> 00:57:08,898
It's brilliant.

403
00:57:09,148 --> 00:57:11,484
I knew you could think of something.

404
00:57:11,734 --> 00:57:16,364
It's the most stupid, irresponsible,
harebrained scheme I've ever heard...

405
00:57:16,614 --> 00:57:20,451
It's the only way they'll fly
with her. That's the way it works.

406
00:57:20,701 --> 00:57:22,203
What is wrong with you?

407
00:57:22,453 --> 00:57:26,082
- I thought you liked the geese.
- I do like the geese!

408
00:57:26,332 --> 00:57:30,211
It's a lot more dangerous for her
to drive on the expressway.

409
00:57:30,461 --> 00:57:33,256
It's the safest ultralight out there.

410
00:57:33,506 --> 00:57:36,300
- It has to be safe as possible.
- But it's pricey.

411
00:57:36,551 --> 00:57:41,013
I don't care about that. It has to be
simple to fly and gentle to put down.

412
00:57:41,264 --> 00:57:44,934
Well, yeah, it'll fly
at 28, 29 miles an hour.

413
00:57:45,184 --> 00:57:49,146
- Really?
- Or even climb at that.

414
00:57:57,405 --> 00:58:00,574
There you go, fellas. Enjoy it.

415
00:58:00,825 --> 00:58:04,495
Thank you very much. Take it easy.

416
00:58:18,467 --> 00:58:20,928
Turn to the right.
Lean. Lean to the right.

417
00:58:21,178 --> 00:58:25,557
Push far to the left. That's it.

418
00:58:26,767 --> 00:58:30,020
Remember, you've got 34 feet
of wing tip up here.

419
00:58:30,270 --> 00:58:32,815
It's kind of like having
real wide hips.

420
00:58:33,065 --> 00:58:35,901
All right, let's make a hard right.
Hard right.

421
00:58:36,151 --> 00:58:38,654
Good leans, like you're flying.
Good girl.

422
00:58:38,904 --> 00:58:43,158
Keep the bar pushed down.
Really bringing it around.

423
00:58:43,408 --> 00:58:47,579
You got it. I'm not doing anything.
It's all you, Amy.

424
00:58:47,829 --> 00:58:50,540
Beautiful! Good leaning.

425
00:58:50,791 --> 00:58:55,128
Go hard to the right, just like
we're flying. Now, swing to the left.

426
00:58:55,379 --> 00:58:58,966
Lean it, lean it, lean it!
There you go!

427
00:58:59,216 --> 00:59:02,135
Beautiful!

428
00:59:02,678 --> 00:59:04,930
Nice and straight. Bar centered.

429
00:59:05,180 --> 00:59:09,810
Nice and easy, eyes straight ahead.
Hold on to the bar, Amy.

430
00:59:10,060 --> 00:59:13,188
Smooth. Push out on the bar.
And up we go!

431
00:59:13,438 --> 00:59:17,859
That a girl! That a girl!
You're doing it.

432
00:59:18,109 --> 00:59:19,861
You're doing it, Ames!

433
00:59:20,111 --> 00:59:26,660
Get the bar, right about there.
Get it up there. You got it!

434
00:59:43,968 --> 00:59:46,679
I've been around
a lot of flyers in my time.

435
00:59:46,930 --> 00:59:49,808
- I think you're a natural.
- Do you really think so?

436
00:59:50,058 --> 00:59:53,603
Some people are, when it comes
to flying. You're one of them.

437
00:59:53,853 --> 00:59:56,523
The wind is coming
from right straight at us.

438
00:59:56,773 --> 01:00:00,151
So it'll go right under the plane.
It's gonna be perfect.

439
01:00:00,401 --> 01:00:03,196
- The plane's gonna be a lot lighter.
- I know, Dad.

440
01:00:03,446 --> 01:00:05,573
Your takeoff roll will be shorter.

441
01:00:05,823 --> 01:00:10,912
You'll climb real fast. But still,
do the smooth push-out with the bar.

442
01:00:11,162 --> 01:00:15,333
Now, I'm coming up right behind you.
Just make passes around the field.

443
01:00:15,583 --> 01:00:18,419
If your engine cuts out,
glide down onto the field.

444
01:00:18,669 --> 01:00:20,797
Don't go anywhere except the field.

445
01:00:21,047 --> 01:00:25,051
- Yeah, I know.
- You're gonna do good.

446
01:00:25,259 --> 01:00:28,096
Lift prop.

447
01:01:31,992 --> 01:01:34,536
Mama Goose, come in.
They've flown the coop.

448
01:01:34,787 --> 01:01:39,708
Mama Goose, can you read me?
They've flown the coop.

449
01:01:40,334 --> 01:01:42,085
Mama Goose.

450
01:01:42,336 --> 01:01:44,922
Come in, Mama Goose.

451
01:01:45,172 --> 01:01:47,758
<i>Amy, can you hear me?</i>

452
01:01:48,008 --> 01:01:50,219
<i>Amy? They've flown out.</i>

453
01:01:50,469 --> 01:01:52,095
<i>-Come in.
-Mama Goose.</i>

454
01:01:52,346 --> 01:01:54,139
Amy, can you hear me?

455
01:01:54,389 --> 01:01:58,185
<i>Mama Goose, is your radio working?</i>

456
01:01:59,311 --> 01:02:04,941
<i>-Tom, do you read me?
-Yeah, Barry, her radio's out.</i>

457
01:02:12,532 --> 01:02:15,118
Yes!

458
01:02:20,582 --> 01:02:22,584
I don't believe it!

459
01:02:22,834 --> 01:02:24,002
It works!

460
01:02:24,252 --> 01:02:26,129
<i>Mama Goose.</i>

461
01:02:26,379 --> 01:02:30,258
<i>Mama Goose. Come in, Mama Goose.</i>

462
01:02:31,051 --> 01:02:35,764
<i>-Maybe the jack's no good.
-I'm about to give her a visual.</i>

463
01:02:36,014 --> 01:02:40,352
Hello, Papa Goose. This is so cool!

464
01:02:40,602 --> 01:02:42,103
Hello?

465
01:02:42,354 --> 01:02:44,647
Dad?

466
01:02:44,898 --> 01:02:47,484
Can you hear me?

467
01:02:52,155 --> 01:02:53,698
Can you hear me?

468
01:02:53,948 --> 01:02:58,787
<i>Yeah. Hey, who's that
on your right shoulder?</i>

469
01:03:00,163 --> 01:03:02,874
Long John!

470
01:03:13,051 --> 01:03:17,221
Look, they're really flying with me!

471
01:04:12,443 --> 01:04:17,114
- So they're flying now, are they?
- What do you want?

472
01:04:17,364 --> 01:04:21,035
- I came by to say hi to your father.
- He's out.

473
01:04:21,285 --> 01:04:25,456
He told you to stay off our property.

474
01:04:25,915 --> 01:04:31,629
- Where does he keep the aeroplanes?
- What aeroplanes?

475
01:04:32,046 --> 01:04:36,341
Well, I know he's
planning something crazy.

476
01:04:36,342 --> 01:04:41,055
- Who's the new guy at the house?
- That's my Uncle David.

477
01:04:41,305 --> 01:04:43,348
He's got a black belt.

478
01:04:43,599 --> 01:04:46,185
We call him "Killer".

479
01:04:46,435 --> 01:04:49,688
Okay, Amy.

480
01:04:52,608 --> 01:04:55,027
I'll see you again.

481
01:04:55,277 --> 01:04:58,405
You can count on it.

482
01:05:04,077 --> 01:05:07,414
Hey, that... Wait a minute.

483
01:05:12,210 --> 01:05:14,254
That's funny. Just go...

484
01:05:14,504 --> 01:05:15,881
...and I'll play, okay?

485
01:05:16,131 --> 01:05:21,178
Ready, on three. And spit. Go!

486
01:05:25,390 --> 01:05:29,895
I just think that we need
to have very clear notions...

487
01:05:30,145 --> 01:05:34,858
...of when we're going to fly
in the day, when we're gonna land.

488
01:05:35,108 --> 01:05:40,196
How long you're gonna lay over.
And then where you're gonna end up.

489
01:05:40,447 --> 01:05:44,784
- That's the most important thing.
- Do me a favour. Get me some maps.

490
01:05:45,035 --> 01:05:46,786
Just, like, go down...

491
01:05:47,037 --> 01:05:49,789
Just go like:
Here's us, here's Florida.

492
01:05:50,040 --> 01:05:52,208
I'll look at the map
and pick the route.

493
01:05:52,459 --> 01:05:56,588
I'm gonna make a call
because I know this guy.

494
01:05:56,838 --> 01:05:59,048
A bird guy...

495
01:05:59,299 --> 01:06:01,843
...in North Carolina.
You're kidding.

496
01:06:02,093 --> 01:06:07,432
He knows, like, migratory paths and...
We called him Birdbrain.

497
01:06:07,682 --> 01:06:10,977
Yes, but this idea
of using aeroplanes...

498
01:06:11,227 --> 01:06:14,522
...to reintroduce
migratory flocks. It's...

499
01:06:14,772 --> 01:06:17,609
Look, I'm sorry.
It's absolute nonsense.

500
01:06:17,859 --> 01:06:21,404
Can you imagine thousands
of little tiny aeroplanes...

501
01:06:21,654 --> 01:06:24,032
...buzzing suburbia at 4 a.m. ...

502
01:06:24,282 --> 01:06:26,993
...showing the birds the way south?

503
01:06:27,243 --> 01:06:29,912
The birds wouldn't follow a plane.

504
01:06:30,163 --> 01:06:33,499
But they do. I've seen them do it.

505
01:06:33,750 --> 01:06:35,918
It really works, if it's done right.

506
01:06:36,169 --> 01:06:39,964
And if geese can do this
then maybe really rare birds...

507
01:06:40,214 --> 01:06:44,552
...like whooping cranes and
trumpeter swans can learn it too.

508
01:06:44,802 --> 01:06:46,888
We can start new flocks...

509
01:06:47,138 --> 01:06:51,475
...and give them a crack
at a comeback, you know?

510
01:06:56,647 --> 01:06:59,066
Do you really think
you can pull this off?

511
01:06:59,317 --> 01:07:02,486
Yes, sir. All we really needed
was a place like this.

512
01:07:02,737 --> 01:07:06,866
Well, of course, there is a catch.
It's right over there.

513
01:07:07,116 --> 01:07:12,037
These 300 acres are all that's left
of what used to be thousands.

514
01:07:12,288 --> 01:07:15,958
In the '30s, the government set this
aside as a wild bird refuge.

515
01:07:16,208 --> 01:07:20,296
But with fewer birds wintering here,
it's been encroached on.

516
01:07:20,546 --> 01:07:22,798
Some people have made a lot of money.

517
01:07:23,048 --> 01:07:26,010
If no wild birds show up
by November 1st...

518
01:07:26,260 --> 01:07:28,762
...these chaps are
just itching to take over.

519
01:07:29,013 --> 01:07:31,640
November 1st? Really?

520
01:07:31,890 --> 01:07:34,310
So if we're here by then, it's ours?

521
01:07:34,560 --> 01:07:35,978
No, not actually yours.

522
01:07:36,228 --> 01:07:39,023
- The birds'.
- Right.

523
01:07:39,857 --> 01:07:42,985
It's perfect!

524
01:07:44,236 --> 01:07:48,699
I sure hope you're right. I don't
want to find out I'm in trouble...

525
01:07:48,949 --> 01:07:52,911
This spot that we found, it's perfect!
It's just perfect.

526
01:07:53,162 --> 01:07:55,956
- But we don't have that long.
- Can you land there?

527
01:07:56,206 --> 01:07:57,416
- Perfectly.
- Okay.

528
01:07:57,666 --> 01:07:59,334
Good, flat surface right near.

529
01:07:59,585 --> 01:08:03,380
- Stop moving back. I'm pushing.
- I felt that.

530
01:08:03,630 --> 01:08:05,465
Squeeze it down a little bit.

531
01:08:05,716 --> 01:08:09,469
Not so it hurts.
Well, it'll move back and forth.

532
01:08:09,720 --> 01:08:14,641
Let's see how it looks.
Get your finger out of your nose.

533
01:08:17,060 --> 01:08:20,022
Nice move, Tom. Very good.

534
01:08:20,272 --> 01:08:23,108
<i>The journey will take
four days of good weather.</i>

535
01:08:23,358 --> 01:08:25,444
<i>Thirty nautical miles
to Lake Ontario.</i>

536
01:08:25,694 --> 01:08:28,488
<i>Then 30 more across the lake
to the U.S. of A.</i>

537
01:08:28,738 --> 01:08:31,450
<i>Now 65 miles further on
is rendezvous number one...</i>

538
01:08:31,700 --> 01:08:34,244
<i>... at a farm outside
Franklinville, NY.</i>

539
01:08:34,494 --> 01:08:36,705
<i>Day two, we're going to Pennsylvania.</i>

540
01:08:36,955 --> 01:08:41,543
<i>Across the Appalachian Mountains,
120 miles to rendezvous number two.</i>

541
01:08:41,793 --> 01:08:44,838
<i>On day three, we fly over Maryland,
east of Baltimore.</i>

542
01:08:45,088 --> 01:08:48,425
<i>Then south across the Potomac
to the lowlands of Virginia.</i>

543
01:08:48,675 --> 01:08:52,679
<i>On day four, we go along Chesapeake
Bay to the town of New Hope.</i>

544
01:08:52,929 --> 01:08:55,432
<i>From there, it's just
10 miles to Valhalla.</i>

545
01:08:55,682 --> 01:08:59,269
- How are they doing?
- They're panting hard after 20 miles.

546
01:08:59,519 --> 01:09:02,439
I really don't think
they can go 150 miles a day.

547
01:09:02,689 --> 01:09:06,276
They've got it in there somewhere.
Wild ones can fly 1000 miles.

548
01:09:06,526 --> 01:09:10,697
- They're thinner afterward but...
- We gotta go earlier than that.

549
01:09:10,947 --> 01:09:14,993
Two day's weather cushion isn't enough.
I say we leave by the 22nd.

550
01:09:15,243 --> 01:09:19,080
Good idea. Barry and I will get
the camping equipment Wednesday.

551
01:09:19,330 --> 01:09:20,707
We got a lead on a boat.

552
01:09:20,957 --> 01:09:24,627
- The GPS and radios are due tomorrow.
- October the 22nd.

553
01:09:24,877 --> 01:09:28,339
- Yes!
- 22nd!

554
01:09:39,142 --> 01:09:41,811
<i>We have one week
to whip them into shape.</i>

555
01:09:42,061 --> 01:09:44,188
<i>We've gotta push them to the limit.</i>

556
01:09:44,439 --> 01:09:47,316
<i>Wild geese average five,
six flight hours a day.</i>

557
01:09:47,567 --> 01:09:51,404
<i>That means we've got to get ours
up to four. Then we'll be okay.</i>

558
01:09:51,654 --> 01:09:54,532
<i>You've gotta be the leader,
and be tough on them.</i>

559
01:09:54,782 --> 01:10:00,204
<i>We can't let up. The wild ones
are already heading south.</i>

560
01:10:05,418 --> 01:10:08,379
<i>-Mama Goose, come in.
-Hello, base.</i>

561
01:10:08,629 --> 01:10:11,007
<i>You've got one very
unhappy bird down here.</i>

562
01:10:11,257 --> 01:10:13,968
Igor!

563
01:10:14,176 --> 01:10:16,721
Goose Ground, put your
radio next to him.

564
01:10:16,971 --> 01:10:19,098
<i>Mama Goose, go ahead, we're ready.</i>

565
01:10:19,348 --> 01:10:25,354
Igor! Stop fooling around.
We're leaving by the end of the week.

566
01:10:27,648 --> 01:10:32,319
You can do it, lgor.
You can do it. Come on.

567
01:10:34,613 --> 01:10:39,201
<i>Mama Goose, we have a liftoff!</i>

568
01:10:46,834 --> 01:10:49,128
<i>I don't see him.</i>

569
01:10:49,378 --> 01:10:51,630
Dad, do you see him?

570
01:10:51,880 --> 01:10:53,924
<i>I don't see him.</i>

571
01:10:54,174 --> 01:10:58,137
<i>I lost him behind the house.
I don't know where he went.</i>

572
01:10:58,387 --> 01:10:59,388
<i>Wait, I see him!</i>

573
01:10:59,638 --> 01:11:01,056
Amy! Amy, watch out!

574
01:11:01,306 --> 01:11:03,517
<i>Here he comes on your right wing.</i>

575
01:11:03,767 --> 01:11:06,687
Igor! Dad, Dad, I hit him!

576
01:11:06,937 --> 01:11:08,063
Igor!

577
01:11:08,313 --> 01:11:11,108
Dad!

578
01:11:11,316 --> 01:11:15,153
- I hit lgor, he's down!
- Listen to me. Look behind you.

579
01:11:15,404 --> 01:11:19,908
<i>You gotta take care of the others.
Let's turn around and head home.</i>

580
01:11:20,158 --> 01:11:24,663
<i>Roger. I'm turning east.</i>

581
01:11:38,635 --> 01:11:39,845
Igor! Hey, goose.

582
01:11:40,095 --> 01:11:46,059
- I don't know if we'll find him.
- We'll find him tonight. We have to.

583
01:12:14,629 --> 01:12:17,215
Igor?

584
01:12:22,053 --> 01:12:23,638
See him?

585
01:12:23,888 --> 01:12:27,642
- Igor.
- Goose, goose, goose.

586
01:12:28,393 --> 01:12:31,020
I don't believe it!

587
01:12:47,286 --> 01:12:50,832
He's lost some primary feathers.
Don't worry, they'll grow back.

588
01:12:51,082 --> 01:12:53,543
He's not going to be able to fly.

589
01:12:53,793 --> 01:12:56,087
He's got to go with his brothers and...

590
01:12:56,337 --> 01:12:58,256
- Careful!
- Take it easy.

591
01:12:58,506 --> 01:13:02,885
Let's just get him home.
We'll think of something.

592
01:13:13,604 --> 01:13:16,857
Daddy!

593
01:13:20,569 --> 01:13:23,322
Clear?

594
01:13:31,080 --> 01:13:34,542
- Oh, I gotta go. See you, guys.
- Where are you going?

595
01:13:34,792 --> 01:13:37,503
Hi.

596
01:13:44,718 --> 01:13:47,930
- Good?
- Good.

597
01:13:50,766 --> 01:13:56,355
<i>-Goose Mobile, phase one complete.
-Roger, Papa Goose.</i>

598
01:14:09,201 --> 01:14:12,996
Don't worry, I'll take care of it.
Have fun with the kids.

599
01:14:13,247 --> 01:14:14,498
Yeah. Yeah.

600
01:14:14,748 --> 01:14:16,625
The buzzard is out of the nest.

601
01:14:16,875 --> 01:14:20,921
<i>Good, we're into phase two
in five minutes.</i>

602
01:14:34,810 --> 01:14:37,729
Because animal management
is everyone's business.

603
01:14:37,979 --> 01:14:40,524
We're all responsible
to protect nature.

604
01:14:40,774 --> 01:14:44,319
To look after the well-being
of the creatures that live in it...

605
01:14:44,569 --> 01:14:46,947
...like we take care of our pets.

606
01:14:47,197 --> 01:14:49,115
Does anybody have a pet at home?

607
01:14:49,366 --> 01:14:52,077
- A hamster!
- Rabbit!

608
01:14:53,578 --> 01:14:56,331
Hi.

609
01:14:56,623 --> 01:14:58,500
- Nice office.
- Can I help you?

610
01:14:58,750 --> 01:15:00,377
Well, I hope so.

611
01:15:00,627 --> 01:15:02,337
My brother and I were camping...

612
01:15:02,587 --> 01:15:05,382
...and the weirdest critter
got in our tent.

613
01:15:05,632 --> 01:15:08,134
Just waltzed in. Nasty little sucker.

614
01:15:08,385 --> 01:15:13,348
I have no idea what it might be.
I was wondering if you'd take a look?

615
01:15:13,598 --> 01:15:18,853
- You brought it back? Alive?
- Out in the truck.

616
01:15:21,856 --> 01:15:25,193
<i>-Phase three in two minutes.
-Hunky-dory!</i>

617
01:15:25,443 --> 01:15:29,239
It's right out here.
I really appreciate it.

618
01:15:29,489 --> 01:15:32,200
Did you bring gloves?

619
01:15:35,119 --> 01:15:37,664
- Oh, God!
- Where is it?

620
01:15:37,914 --> 01:15:44,212
- It got out. You have kids around?
- What did it look like?

621
01:15:46,047 --> 01:15:50,635
A big cooker spaniel.
Only he had a... Almost bald.

622
01:15:50,885 --> 01:15:55,264
Fur just around the neck.
Very spiky around here.

623
01:15:59,894 --> 01:16:03,523
You go this way, I'll go this way,
and we'll meet back here.

624
01:16:03,773 --> 01:16:05,107
Careful.

625
01:16:05,358 --> 01:16:07,276
You be careful. Be very careful!

626
01:16:07,526 --> 01:16:11,864
It's very temperamental.
It's very big.

627
01:16:25,669 --> 01:16:28,547
- Get up, get up!
<i>-Thank you, guys.</i>

628
01:16:28,798 --> 01:16:31,008
<i>Final phase is one minute away.</i>

629
01:16:31,258 --> 01:16:36,597
Our own area is blessed with a rich
cornucopia, if you will, of wildlife.

630
01:16:36,847 --> 01:16:39,099
Beaver, bear, badgers...

631
01:16:39,350 --> 01:16:42,102
Check it out!
...grey foxes...

632
01:16:42,353 --> 01:16:44,939
Yeah. Beetles...

633
01:16:45,189 --> 01:16:46,982
Not the old rock group but...

634
01:16:47,233 --> 01:16:51,862
I think it's Amy. Hey, it's Amy!

635
01:17:04,583 --> 01:17:07,628
Mama to Papa, that was so cool!

636
01:17:07,878 --> 01:17:10,380
<i>I just made a criminal
out of my daughter.</i>

637
01:17:10,631 --> 01:17:12,758
<i>Now we'll both do time behind bars.</i>

638
01:17:13,008 --> 01:17:16,136
Dad, stop being so dramatic.

639
01:17:16,386 --> 01:17:18,597
<i>Look, it's just beginning, Amy.</i>

640
01:17:18,847 --> 01:17:21,558
<i>We've gotta make 120
nautical miles by sundown...</i>

641
01:17:21,808 --> 01:17:23,602
<i>... fly across Lake Ontario...</i>

642
01:17:23,852 --> 01:17:27,981
<i>... cross international lines without
a permit, carrying stolen goods...</i>

643
01:17:28,231 --> 01:17:32,194
<i>... without filing a flight plan,
without any official approval...</i>

644
01:17:32,444 --> 01:17:34,655
<i>... four days behind schedule.</i>

645
01:17:34,905 --> 01:17:38,575
<i>We're on the edge, my dear.</i>

646
01:17:39,743 --> 01:17:44,247
<i>Let's start a slow climb. I want
plenty of altitude over the lake.</i>

647
01:17:44,498 --> 01:17:47,501
Roger.

648
01:17:58,136 --> 01:18:01,431
Father Goose to Wet Goose,
how do you read?

649
01:18:01,681 --> 01:18:04,517
<i>Loud and clear, Father Goose.
How are you doing?</i>

650
01:18:04,768 --> 01:18:08,313
Headwind's picking up.
What's our ground speed?

651
01:18:08,563 --> 01:18:12,692
<i>-Down to 21 knots. How's your fuel?
- Two hours at best.</i>

652
01:18:12,942 --> 01:18:18,531
<i>We're past the point of no return,
so it'll be landfall around dark.</i>

653
01:18:22,243 --> 01:18:25,205
- Sir, you'd better look at this.
- What do you got?

654
01:18:25,455 --> 01:18:31,336
- No idea. Very unorthodox signature.
- Hey, man, that's Newfoundland.

655
01:18:44,390 --> 01:18:47,226
I've got some awful
tired birds back here.

656
01:18:47,477 --> 01:18:53,483
<i>Landfall in about five minutes, Amy.</i>

657
01:18:55,943 --> 01:18:59,197
Sir, it's still heading
straight at us.

658
01:18:59,447 --> 01:19:01,324
- Any contact?
- Negative, sir.

659
01:19:01,574 --> 01:19:04,452
We've gotta go.
Give me full alert, red alert.

660
01:19:04,702 --> 01:19:08,289
<i>Papa Goose to Wet Goose,
we won't make it to rendezvous one.</i>

661
01:19:08,539 --> 01:19:10,374
<i>Roger, Father Goose.</i>

662
01:19:10,625 --> 01:19:13,377
- We're on fumes, we've gotta put down.
<i>-Roger.</i>

663
01:19:13,628 --> 01:19:18,257
<i>We'll tie up and wait
till we hear from you.</i>

664
01:19:19,258 --> 01:19:24,430
We just lucked out. I got a visual
on what appears to be an airfield.

665
01:19:24,680 --> 01:19:27,892
Stay on me, we're going down.

666
01:19:28,017 --> 01:19:34,106
- Let's do this, men. Scramble field.
- Scramble field. Code One.

667
01:19:58,297 --> 01:20:02,051
<i>63 Romeo, on final and holding.</i>

668
01:20:11,101 --> 01:20:14,146
- 63 Romeo, position and hold.
<i>-Roger.</i>

669
01:20:14,396 --> 01:20:16,690
<i>63 Romeo, waiting for takeoff.</i>

670
01:20:16,940 --> 01:20:21,612
63 Romeo, hold your position.
Unidentified traffic on short final.

671
01:20:21,862 --> 01:20:24,740
<i>They're landing? Here?</i>

672
01:20:24,990 --> 01:20:29,578
<i>Tower, this is 43 Tango.
We have the bogies in sight.</i>

673
01:20:33,332 --> 01:20:39,046
<i>Hey, guys, this is really strange.
I suggest you call security.</i>

674
01:20:40,964 --> 01:20:45,385
Oh, great.
The rudder's coming loose again.

675
01:20:46,386 --> 01:20:50,265
Hey, what's that? Dad?

676
01:20:50,307 --> 01:20:52,476
Who is it?

677
01:20:52,726 --> 01:20:55,645
Dad?

678
01:20:56,062 --> 01:21:00,275
- Freeze!
- Get down on the ground!

679
01:21:06,239 --> 01:21:07,532
Stay down, Amy.

680
01:21:07,782 --> 01:21:08,867
What's going on?

681
01:21:09,117 --> 01:21:11,953
No gifts, no produce, no flowers.
No Cuban cigars.

682
01:21:12,203 --> 01:21:14,831
Oh, yeah?

683
01:21:16,499 --> 01:21:18,918
That's a lot of stuff for one camper.

684
01:21:19,169 --> 01:21:22,505
Well, I'm a serious camper.

685
01:21:22,756 --> 01:21:24,049
What's the cage for?

686
01:21:24,299 --> 01:21:27,844
I'm also a paranoid camper.
See, I sleep in it.

687
01:21:28,094 --> 01:21:31,556
Keeps the little furries out.
Doesn't do much for the big ones.

688
01:21:31,806 --> 01:21:34,350
All they'll do is
look at me and drool.

689
01:21:34,601 --> 01:21:36,561
What's all the gasoline for?

690
01:21:36,811 --> 01:21:40,356
That's for my portable generator.
For my VCR and blender.

691
01:21:40,607 --> 01:21:45,069
Nothing like a scary movie
and a pina colada in the wilderness.

692
01:21:45,320 --> 01:21:46,321
Open the back.

693
01:21:46,571 --> 01:21:50,325
Sir, it was an absolute emergency.
We had no idea this was...

694
01:21:50,575 --> 01:21:53,578
- Stop playing with those birds!
- Yes, sir!

695
01:21:53,828 --> 01:21:56,414
It was either land here
or in Lake Ontario.

696
01:21:56,664 --> 01:21:58,124
We're really sorry.

697
01:21:58,374 --> 01:22:02,086
You put this entire military base
on full alert.

698
01:22:02,336 --> 01:22:04,922
You caused us a mountain of paperwork.

699
01:22:05,173 --> 01:22:09,343
Not to mention setting two of
my pilots back emotionally 20 years.

700
01:22:09,594 --> 01:22:12,763
And you're really sorry?

701
01:22:13,014 --> 01:22:17,310
We promise we'll never do it again.

702
01:22:17,393 --> 01:22:19,562
Okay.

703
01:22:19,812 --> 01:22:23,649
Just as long as you promise.

704
01:22:26,861 --> 01:22:32,199
- A little closer together.
- Smile, this is for the morning paper.

705
01:22:32,450 --> 01:22:35,119
A little closer.

706
01:22:36,996 --> 01:22:39,999
- Thank you. That's it.
- You got it? You're okay?

707
01:22:40,249 --> 01:22:41,959
<i>Talk about being at
the right place and time...</i>

708
01:22:42,209 --> 01:22:46,755
<i>... Ed Nichol was at the Niagara Air
Force Base this morning and shot this:</i>

709
01:22:47,006 --> 01:22:50,801
<i>It seems an unlikely pair
sneaked into the high security base...</i>

710
01:22:51,051 --> 01:22:52,761
<i>... with a flock of birds.</i>

711
01:22:53,012 --> 01:22:58,267
<i>Yeah, real birds.
You know, the flapping kind.</i>

712
01:22:58,350 --> 01:23:00,936
<i>Have you heard about
this kid and her birds?</i>

713
01:23:01,186 --> 01:23:03,731
<i>14-year-old Amy Alden
and 15 Canada geese.</i>

714
01:23:03,981 --> 01:23:07,818
<i>She's leading them south
in this really big goose.</i>

715
01:23:08,068 --> 01:23:09,445
<i>This is for real.</i>

716
01:23:09,695 --> 01:23:12,573
<i>They departed from
Niagara Air Base at 5 a.m.</i>

717
01:23:12,823 --> 01:23:18,787
<i>General Hatfield says he has never
seen such an inspirational sight.</i>

718
01:23:21,165 --> 01:23:26,003
<i>-All present and accounted for?
- Roger. Hey, listen to this.</i>

719
01:23:26,253 --> 01:23:29,590
<i>... she's got pet geese or ducks
or canaries or whatever...</i>

720
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:31,466
<i>... and she's leading them south...</i>

721
01:23:31,717 --> 01:23:35,137
<i>In other news, Amy Alden,
a 14-year-old from Southern Ontario...</i>

722
01:23:35,387 --> 01:23:37,889
<i>... is on a mission
over New York State...</i>

723
01:23:38,140 --> 01:23:42,853
<i>The birds have names like Igor,
Stinky, Long John and Feather brain.</i>

724
01:23:43,103 --> 01:23:46,481
<i>... anyone would actually shoot
and eat these marvelous birds?</i>

725
01:23:46,732 --> 01:23:49,735
<i>I like them with an orange sauce,
with wild rice.</i>

726
01:23:49,985 --> 01:23:53,739
<i>Flat on their back, golden brown.</i>

727
01:24:28,148 --> 01:24:34,821
<i>-Dad, how much further?
-Ten more miles, Amy. Not far.</i>

728
01:24:37,449 --> 01:24:40,869
<i>Dad, look at that!</i>

729
01:24:44,622 --> 01:24:48,167
<i>Where are they going?
Hey, Long John, come back!</i>

730
01:24:48,418 --> 01:24:50,795
<i>It's the wild ones.
They're going with them.</i>

731
01:24:51,045 --> 01:24:55,258
<i>We have to follow them
or we'll lose them.</i>

732
01:25:00,555 --> 01:25:04,434
Hey, where do you think you're going?

733
01:25:10,064 --> 01:25:13,109
<i>Dad, they're shooting!</i>

734
01:25:14,444 --> 01:25:16,571
<i>Let me try and head them off!</i>

735
01:25:16,821 --> 01:25:20,700
<i>I'll try to get in front of them!</i>

736
01:25:20,992 --> 01:25:23,619
Here they come.

737
01:25:33,004 --> 01:25:36,132
Holy shit!

738
01:25:43,180 --> 01:25:44,181
<i>They're down.</i>

739
01:25:44,432 --> 01:25:49,895
Set up on a short final to that field
at your 11 o'clock.

740
01:26:03,158 --> 01:26:08,163
You people don't give up, do you?
Now you're poaching off of planes.

741
01:26:08,414 --> 01:26:11,917
- I ought to blow a hole in you.
- Ma'am, listen.

742
01:26:12,167 --> 01:26:15,129
Wait a minute.

743
01:26:20,551 --> 01:26:23,846
Isn't she the little girl
I've seen on television?

744
01:26:24,096 --> 01:26:26,223
<i>For those who think all news is bad...</i>

745
01:26:26,473 --> 01:26:28,392
<i>... have you heard about the Aldens...</i>

746
01:26:28,642 --> 01:26:31,061
<i>...flying with the birds?
No more bird jokes!</i>

747
01:26:31,311 --> 01:26:34,147
<i>They're leading an orphaned
flock of geese south...</i>

748
01:26:34,398 --> 01:26:36,775
<i>... on an unprecedented
500-mile odyssey.</i>

749
01:26:37,025 --> 01:26:40,988
...nice place, about 20 miles out.

750
01:26:41,697 --> 01:26:45,450
First thing tomorrow, if we can
separate them from the wild ones.

751
01:26:45,701 --> 01:26:48,954
<i>... I saw something out of a dream.</i>

752
01:26:54,751 --> 01:26:58,296
I want to know something.

753
01:26:58,797 --> 01:27:02,551
What happened between you and Mum?

754
01:27:03,927 --> 01:27:06,388
What did she tell you?

755
01:27:06,638 --> 01:27:09,641
She said you were both artists.

756
01:27:09,891 --> 01:27:11,935
And that was difficult
to begin with...

757
01:27:12,185 --> 01:27:17,566
...because artists
can be selfish sometimes.

758
01:27:17,816 --> 01:27:20,068
That's true.

759
01:27:20,318 --> 01:27:24,155
She said you were both to blame.

760
01:27:25,407 --> 01:27:31,162
We couldn't have been all wrong.
We got you.

761
01:27:31,204 --> 01:27:35,333
But you hardly ever came to see me.

762
01:27:36,626 --> 01:27:40,630
Well, New Zealand's pretty far away.

763
01:27:42,257 --> 01:27:46,678
That's a really lame excuse, Dad.

764
01:27:56,896 --> 01:28:03,152
It took me a long time to admit that
letting you both go was a mistake.

765
01:28:03,695 --> 01:28:08,574
For a while,
I just buried myself in my work.

766
01:28:09,742 --> 01:28:14,789
I was afraid, Amy.
I was afraid, angry...

767
01:28:15,039 --> 01:28:18,584
Mostly at myself.

768
01:28:19,752 --> 01:28:23,172
I'm really sorry.

769
01:28:32,557 --> 01:28:35,893
Come on, geese!

770
01:29:05,464 --> 01:29:08,384
- We have to get on 95.
- 37.

771
01:29:08,634 --> 01:29:11,428
Yeah, we do. We have to end up on 95.

772
01:29:11,679 --> 01:29:15,432
<i>... moving northeast. It should
allow good flying for the Aldens...</i>

773
01:29:15,683 --> 01:29:19,603
<i>... with the possible exception of
fog in the upper Chesapeake area.</i>

774
01:29:19,853 --> 01:29:24,650
<i>Their destination is a coastal town,
now coming alive in expectation...</i>

775
01:29:24,900 --> 01:29:28,821
<i>For 1000 big bucks,
Richard Cartwright from Pimlico, MA:</i>

776
01:29:29,071 --> 01:29:31,698
<i>How many geese
are following Amy south?</i>

777
01:29:31,949 --> 01:29:35,994
<i>In honor of Amy and her geese,
here's "Birds of a Feather".</i>

778
01:29:36,245 --> 01:29:41,208
<i>I had me a damn turkey once
that wouldn't follow me anywhere.</i>

779
01:29:57,015 --> 01:29:59,101
<i>Goose Ground, we're in the soup.</i>

780
01:29:59,351 --> 01:30:02,062
<i>My high-tech navigational
equipment isn't working.</i>

781
01:30:02,312 --> 01:30:04,898
- Could be batteries.
- Oh, no!

782
01:30:05,148 --> 01:30:08,568
<i>-Dad, how could you forget batteries?
-I don't know.</i>

783
01:30:08,819 --> 01:30:12,072
<i>-I think we're west of Baltimore.
- Sounds about right.</i>

784
01:30:12,322 --> 01:30:15,116
<i>We'll come down slow,
and land if we find a place.</i>

785
01:30:15,367 --> 01:30:17,035
What does that sign say?

786
01:30:17,285 --> 01:30:22,457
<i>Yeah, okay. Roger, Papa Goose.
Over and out.</i>

787
01:30:23,041 --> 01:30:26,336
Dad, watch out!

788
01:30:27,462 --> 01:30:33,301
<i>Amy, stay on the main street!
Just stay on the main street!</i>

789
01:30:33,385 --> 01:30:37,847
- Look at that!
- That must be the goose kid!

790
01:30:53,613 --> 01:30:56,074
<i>It happened just after 2:00...</i>

791
01:30:56,324 --> 01:31:00,578
<i>... and folks into two-martini lunches
in Baltimore may swear off them.</i>

792
01:31:00,828 --> 01:31:04,666
<i>The plot is thickening down south.
Diane Brawley reports.</i>

793
01:31:04,916 --> 01:31:08,086
<i>What we have is an
increasingly nasty confrontation...</i>

794
01:31:08,336 --> 01:31:13,508
<i>... between Greenies and tree-huggers
against forces of economic progress.</i>

795
01:31:13,758 --> 01:31:18,137
<i>This is the realization
of a lifelong dream for me.</i>

796
01:31:18,388 --> 01:31:22,058
<i>I have men and machinery committed.
I can't walk away...</i>

797
01:31:22,308 --> 01:31:24,685
<i>... just for a bunch of ducks.</i>

798
01:31:24,936 --> 01:31:26,354
<i>Geese.</i>

799
01:31:26,604 --> 01:31:29,190
<i>Whatever.</i>

800
01:31:48,793 --> 01:31:53,547
<i>Papa to Mobile, our estimated time
of arrival, one hour before sundown.</i>

801
01:31:53,798 --> 01:31:57,093
We have fuel, so go on ahead
and set up for our arrival.

802
01:31:57,343 --> 01:32:00,179
Roger. We'll see you in Valhalla.

803
01:32:00,429 --> 01:32:02,306
<i>This is Goose Ground signing off.</i>

804
01:32:02,556 --> 01:32:06,101
<i>Thanks, Goose Ground.</i>

805
01:32:24,161 --> 01:32:27,414
<i>Dad, what's wrong?</i>

806
01:32:31,418 --> 01:32:33,003
Dad!

807
01:32:33,253 --> 01:32:36,882
<i>Uncle David, this is Mama Goose!
Come in! Come in!</i>

808
01:32:37,132 --> 01:32:40,010
- Have we got time to eat?
- 17 north.

809
01:32:40,260 --> 01:32:42,554
Find a place to get some real food.

810
01:32:42,805 --> 01:32:45,933
Daddy!

811
01:32:54,024 --> 01:32:57,778
- Damn!
- Are you okay?

812
01:32:59,571 --> 01:33:04,826
What are we gonna do now?
How will we get there by sundown?

813
01:33:05,077 --> 01:33:08,163
I think I dislocated my shoulder.

814
01:33:08,413 --> 01:33:12,334
- You'll have to take them alone.
- Can't we both go in my plane?

815
01:33:12,584 --> 01:33:16,129
There isn't enough fuel for both
of us. It'd be too slow.

816
01:33:16,379 --> 01:33:18,632
We wouldn't make it on time.

817
01:33:18,882 --> 01:33:22,093
It's only 30 miles, an hour away.
You can do it.

818
01:33:22,344 --> 01:33:25,263
I can't find my way without you.

819
01:33:25,513 --> 01:33:28,683
Yes, you can.

820
01:33:29,184 --> 01:33:32,187
Because you're like your mother.

821
01:33:32,437 --> 01:33:34,898
She was brave, you know.

822
01:33:35,148 --> 01:33:38,610
She went off, followed her dream.
Nobody helped her.

823
01:33:38,860 --> 01:33:42,864
You have that strength in you too.

824
01:33:46,576 --> 01:33:49,621
I wish she was here now.

825
01:33:52,624 --> 01:33:54,751
She is.

826
01:33:55,001 --> 01:33:57,504
She's right next to you.

827
01:33:57,754 --> 01:33:59,631
She's in the geese.

828
01:33:59,881 --> 01:34:04,052
She's in the sky.
She's all around you.

829
01:34:04,427 --> 01:34:08,097
She won't let you down.

830
01:34:11,351 --> 01:34:13,353
I can't leave you here.

831
01:34:13,603 --> 01:34:14,604
Yes, you can.

832
01:34:14,854 --> 01:34:21,027
You take that plane, those geese,
and you fly away.

833
01:34:24,906 --> 01:34:28,451
- Bye, Dad.
- Go.

834
01:34:28,701 --> 01:34:31,913
Follow the river until you reach
the town of New Hope.

835
01:34:32,163 --> 01:34:36,083
Then turn southwest
and follow the coast for 10 miles.

836
01:34:36,334 --> 01:34:41,130
- Look for a lot of cars and people!
- Goodbye, Dad!

837
01:34:41,380 --> 01:34:44,175
Go, Amy.

838
01:35:12,536 --> 01:35:16,999
We're gonna start before sunset.
All right, start it up.

839
01:35:17,249 --> 01:35:20,169
We're gonna start.

840
01:35:28,594 --> 01:35:32,639
<i>On the surface, it seemed
so simple and harmless and clean.</i>

841
01:35:32,890 --> 01:35:36,435
<i>But it's gotten complicated
in the saga of Amy and her birds.</i>

842
01:35:36,685 --> 01:35:38,312
<i>Colin Beardsley reports.</i>

843
01:35:38,562 --> 01:35:44,401
<i>So far, no trace of Amy, Thomas
or the geese. They've disappeared.</i>

844
01:35:49,114 --> 01:35:53,577
- Can I hitch a ride?
- Join the party.

845
01:36:02,544 --> 01:36:07,382
Oh, my goodness!
Is that that little girl?

846
01:36:30,822 --> 01:36:36,369
Zoning Ordinance number 3185-7...

847
01:36:36,620 --> 01:36:38,496
...is now in effect!

848
01:36:38,747 --> 01:36:44,753
This is private property!
Please remove yourselves!

849
01:36:58,641 --> 01:37:01,686
Everybody! Everybody, please!

850
01:37:01,936 --> 01:37:05,690
My daughter is up there by herself!

851
01:37:05,940 --> 01:37:09,027
If you be quiet,
we might be able to hear her.

852
01:37:09,277 --> 01:37:12,947
Just listen to me for one moment...

853
01:37:13,197 --> 01:37:17,035
Shut that thing off!

854
01:40:19,924 --> 01:40:23,011
She's coming!

855
01:40:59,005 --> 01:41:02,883
I don't believe this.

856
01:46:54,607 --> 01:46:57,193
